Abstract—In this article, we use geometric optimal control to com-
pletely solve the problem of minimum-time transitions between thermal
equilibrium states of the quantum parametric oscillator, which ﬁnds
applications in various physical contexts. We discover a new kind of
optimal solutions, absent from all the previous treatments of the problem.

I. INTRODUCTION

C ONSTANTIN Carath´eodory,

the famous mathematician with
seminal contributions in the calculus of variations [1] which
paved the way to optimal control theory [2], pioneered the axiomatic
formulation of thermodynamics along a purely geometric approach
[3], at the dawn of the 20th century. Based on these foundations,
the geometry of thermodynamics [4] was developed many decades
later. In this context, thermal equilibrium states are represented as
points on a manifold and tools from differential geometry are used
to quantify the distance between them and to express the laws of
thermodynamics. Closely related to this approach is the subject of
ﬁnite-time thermodynamics [5], [6], which aims to optimize the
performance of a thermodynamic system under restrictions on the
available time, for example to maximize the extracted power. Optimal
control theory [7] is the mathematical tool used to tackle this kind of
problems, thus the connection between thermodynamics and control
is not just restricted to the emblematic ﬁgure of Carath´eodory but is
actually deeper.

The ﬁeld of ﬁnite-time thermodynamics has been recently revi-
talized in the context of quantum systems, where the design and
optimization of nanoscale heat engines provides the major motivation
[8]–[17]. One paradigmatic example which stands out from the rest is
the quantum parametric oscillator [9], a quantum harmonic oscillator
whose angular frequency can be altered with time and serves as the
control parameter. The problem related to this system is, starting
from a thermal equilibrium state and changing the frequency from
some initial to a lower ﬁnal value, to ﬁnd the maximum work that
can be extracted and the minimum necessary time. The authors of
[9] consider the realistic case where the frequency of the oscillator
can only take real values, corresponding to nonnegative stiffness,
which is restricted between a lower and an upper bound. Under these
assumptions, they show that the maximum work is obtained when
the ﬁnal state of the system is also an equilibrium state, and provide
an analytical estimate of the minimum time, which depends on the
frequency bounds. The minimum-time solution is achieved when
the frequency changes in a bang-bang manner between its boundary
values following a three-jumps strategy, including two jumps at the
initial and ﬁnal times and only one intermediate switching.

The importance of this problem stems from its applicability in
various frameworks. First, as a minimum-time problem between two
thermal states, it can ﬁnd application is solid-state chemistry, in the
transition from graphite to diamond, as pointed out by the authors
in [9]. Second, if the frequency at the ﬁnal state is lower than the

tions, Hellenic Army Academy, Vari, Athens 16673, Greece, e-mail: dion-

frequency at the initial state, the temperature corresponding to the
ﬁnal thermal state is lower than the initial temperature and this
corresponds to cooling the system. During the process of frequency
change the system is isolated from its environment, so its entropy
remains constant and the process is adiabatic in the thermodynamic
sense. Thus, the solution of the problem provides also the minimum
time for an adiabatic stroke in a quantum heat engine, operating
between a hot and a cold reservoir. But the described process is
effectively adiabatic also in the quantum sense, since the populations
of the energy levels at the ﬁnal state are the same with those of
the corresponding energy levels at
the initial state. Recall from
elementary quantum physics that for the process to be adiabatic it
would be necessary the populations to remain the same during the
whole procedure, and this would require a slow enough variation of
the frequency from the initial to the ﬁnal value. In contrast, during
the minimum-time process the frequency changes abruptly and only
at the ﬁnal time is recovered the initial population distribution, thus it
is characterized as effectively adiabatic. In conclusion, the minimum-
time solution provides also the fastest effectively adiabatic cooling for
a particle trapped in the parametric harmonic oscillator, a procedure
with many interesting applications in physics [18].

It was in this last context of adiabatic-like cooling where “shortcuts
to adiabaticity” were introduced [18], protocols where the time-proﬁle
of the frequency is obtained by appropriate interpolation between the
initial and ﬁnal values. The authors of [18] permitted the possibility
that the harmonic potential can become expulsive for some time
intervals, which corresponds to imaginary frequency and negative
stiffness of the oscillator (the actual control in this case), and did
not apply any control bounds. Under these broader assumptions,
compared to those in the original formulation [9] where only real
bounded frequencies were allowed, they concluded that the desired
transition between the initial and ﬁnal thermal states can take place
in arbitrarily short times. By imposing bounds on the stiffness of
the oscillator, which are always present because of experimental
limitations, we were able to show that even in the case where a
expulsive potential is allowed, there is a minimum necessary time
for the transition between the thermal states [19]. We formulated the
corresponding optimal control problem and proved that the optimal
solution has the bang-bang form, as in the original case [9]. In
our subsequent work [20] we completely solved the problem where
negative stiffness values are allowed, and obtained a type of solution
with an even number of intermediate switchings, which was absent
from the original work [9]. Recently, it was numerically conﬁrmed
[21] by some authors of [9] that our solution is encountered even
in the more restrictive case, for appropriate values of the parameters
(control bounds, ratio of initial and ﬁnal frequency).

This last work gave as the motivation to rigorously study the
optimal control problem for the restrictive case with nonnegative
stiffness. As the authors in [22] point out, “more restrictive controls
can lead to more interesting answers that reveal more of the physics of
the problem”. Note that optimal control theory [7] is one of the basic
methods of quantum control [23] and has been successfully applied
to obtain minimum-time solutions for several quantum systems [20],
[24]–[31], in an attempt to reduce the undesirable interactions with

the environment which lead to dissipation and decoherence. In the
present article, we use geometric optimal control [32] and completely
solve the problem of minimum-time transitions between thermal
states of the quantum parametric oscillator, for the restrictive case
where the stiffness can only take nonnegative values (real frequency)
[9]. We recover the one intermediate switching solution, presented in
[9], and our solution with even number of intermediate switchings,
introduced in [20] in the more general setting and conﬁrmed in [21]
for the system at hand. But we also ﬁnd a new kind of solution,
with more than one odd number of intermediate switchings, which
is absent from all the related previous works [9], [21], [22], [33]–
[35]. This is the main contribution of this paper. Note that we didn’t
identify this type of solution in our previous work [20], in the more
general case where the stiffness can take negative values, since this
solution was excluded for the control set considered there.

In the next section we show the relation of the problem, as deﬁned
in [21], with our formalism in [20]. The corresponding optimal
control problem is solved in Section III. In Section IV we illustrate
the various types of solutions with several examples, and highlight
the discovered new kind of solution. Section V concludes the paper.

II. FORMULATION OF THE MINIMUM-TIME PROBLEM

The system that we consider in this article is a particle of mass m
trapped in a parametric harmonic oscillator [9], [21], [22], [33]–[35].
The corresponding Hamiltonian is

ˆH =

ˆp2
2m

,

(1)

where ˆq, ˆp are the position and momentum operators, respectively,
and ω(t) is the time-varying frequency of the oscillator which serves
as the available control. The time evolution of a quantum observable
(hermitian operator) ˆO in the Heisenberg picture is given by [36]

where ı = √−1 and  is Planck’s constant. The following operators

corresponding terminal conditions are

z1(T ) =

,

z2(T ) = Ef ,

z3(T ) = 0.

(11)

It can be easily veriﬁed that, during the evolution of the system, the
following quantity, called the Casimir companion, is a constant of
the motion [37]

For all the equilibrium states it is z3 = 0, thus these states lie on the
hyperbola

in the z1z2-plane. Using (11) in (13) we ﬁnd

For a canonical ensemble of quantum harmonic oscillators, the equi-
librium energy E is related to the temperature T and the frequency
ω through the expression

E =

(15)

From this relation and the ratio of the energies at the initial and ﬁnal
states, we conclude that the corresponding ensemble temperatures
satisfy

this corresponds to a temperature reduction
(cooling) by a factor of ω0/ωf . We would like to ﬁnd the time-
varying frequency ω(t), with

ω(t) =( ω0,

of these operators, where ρ0 is the density matrix corresponding to the
initial state of the system at t = 0 (recall that we use the Heisenberg
picture). From (2) and (4) we easily ﬁnd

˙z1 = z3,
˙z2 = −ω2z3,
˙z3 = −2ω2z1 + 2z2.

In order to ﬁnd the initial and ﬁnal values of zi note that
states of thermodynamic equilibrium, with ω(t) = ω constant, are
characterized by the equipartition of energy E = h ˆHi

If the system starts at t = 0 from the equilibrium state with frequency
ω0 and energy E0, using (8) and (9) in (3) we ﬁnd

z1(0) =

,

z2(0) = E0,

z3(0) = 0.

(10)

0 < ω1 ≤ ωf < ω0 ≤ ω2 < ∞,

which drives the system from the equilibrium state (10) to the
equilibrium state (11) in minimum time T .

In order to solve this problem, we will use the constant of the
motion (12) to reduce the dimension of the system from three to
two, following a different approach than that in [21]. Let us deﬁne
the dimensionless variable b through the relations

b = phˆq2i

q0

,

q0 =s E0

mω2
0

,

(21)

where note that q0 has length dimensions. Then, using the deﬁnition
of ˆz1 from (3) and Eqs. (5)-(7), variables zi can be expressed in
terms of b as follows

z1 =

(b¨b + ˙b2 + ω2b2), z3 =

b˙b.

(22)

If we plug (22) in (12), we obtain the following Ermakov equation
for b(t) [18], [38]

¨b(t) + ω2(t)b(t) =

0

ω2
b3(t)

(23)

The boundary conditions for b can be found by using (22) in (10)
and (11). They are

and

b(0) = 1,

˙b(0) = 0

b(T ) =r ω0

ωf

,

˙b(T ) = 0,

(24)

(25)

where we have additionally used (14) in the derivation of b(T ). Note
that from (23) we can also obtain ¨b(0) = ¨b(T ) = 0, as long as the
frequency boundary conditions (18) are satisﬁed, so we only need to
consider the latter.

If we set

x1 = b, x2 =

˙b
ω0

, u(t) =

ω2(t)

ω2

,

(26)

and rescale time according to tnew = ω0told, we obtain the
following system of ﬁrst order differential equations, equivalent to
the Ermakov equation

˙x1 = x2,

˙x2 = −ux1 +

The control bounds are

(29)

(30)

(31)

Using (26) to translate the boundary conditions (18), (24), (25)
for ω, b into corresponding conditions for u, x1, x2, we obtain the
following time-optimal problem for system (27), (28):

Problem 1: Find u1 ≤ u(t) ≤ u2 with u1, u2 satisfying (31) and
u(0) = 1, u(T ) = 1/γ 4, such that starting from (x1(0), x2(0)) =
(1, 0), the above system reaches the ﬁnal point (x1(T ), x2(T )) =
(γ, 0), γ > 1, in minimum time T .

In the next section we solve the following optimal control problem,
where we drop the boundary conditions on the control u, as we justify
below:

Problem 2: Find u1 ≤ u(t) ≤ u2, with u1, u2 satisfying (31),
such that starting from (x1(0), x2(0)) = (1, 0), the system above
reaches the ﬁnal point (x1(T ), x2(T )) = (γ, 0), γ > 1, in minimum
time T .

In both problems the class of admissible controls formally are
Lebesgue measurable functions which take values in the control
set [u1, u2] almost everywhere. However, as we shall see, optimal
controls are piecewise continuous, in fact bang-bang. The optimal
control found for problem 2 is also optimal for problem 1, with the
addition of instantaneous jumps at the initial and ﬁnal points, so that
the boundary conditions u(0) = 1 and u(T ) = 1/γ 4 are satisﬁed.
Note that in connection with (18), a natural way to think about these
conditions is that u(t) = 1 for t ≤ 0 and u(t) = 1/γ 4 for t ≥ T ;
in the interval (0, T ) we pick the control that achieves the desired
transfer in minimum time.
Remark 1: Observe that

the above system (27), (28) can be
interpreted as describing the one-dimensional Newtonian motion of a
unit-mass particle, with position coordinate x1 and velocity x2. The
acceleration (force) acting on the particle is −ux1 +1/x3
1. This point
of view can provide useful intuition about the time-optimal solution,
as we will see later.

III. OPTIMAL SOLUTION

In our previous work [20] we solved a problem similar to Problem
2, where the control was restricted as −u1 ≤ u(t) ≤ u2, with
u1, u2 ≥ 1. Note that in this setting, the possibility of negative control
ω2(t) < 0 (expulsive parabolic potential) for some time intervals was
permitted [18]. In the present article we consider the very interesting
practical case where only attractive parabolic potential is allowed [9].
In this section we investigate how our previous solution is modiﬁed
due to the restriction of the control in a more narrow set. As we
will see, a new type of solution arises, which was forbidden in the
previous setting. In the following, we provide the details of the proofs
which are modiﬁed, compared to the previous case, and also the basic
steps of the proofs which remain the same, for completeness.

The system described by (27), (28) can be expressed in compact

form as

˙x = f (x) + ug(x),

where the vector ﬁelds are given by

f =  x2

1/x3

1 ! , g =  0

−x1 !

(32)

(33)

and x ∈ D = {(x1, x2) ∈ R2 : x1 > 0} and u ∈ U = [u1, u2]. Ad-
missible controls are Lebesgue measurable functions that take values
in the control set U. Given an admissible control u deﬁned over an
interval [0, T ], the solution x of the system (32) corresponding to the
control u is called the corresponding trajectory and we call the pair
(x, u) a controlled trajectory. Note that the domain D is invariant in
the sense that trajectories cannot leave D. Starting with any positive
initial condition x1(0) > 0, and using any admissible control u, as
x1 → 0+, the “repulsive force” 1/x3
1 leads to an increase in x1 that
will keep x1 positive (as long as the solutions exist).
For a constant λ0 and a row vector λ = (λ1, λ2) ∈(cid:0)R2(cid:1)∗ deﬁne

the control Hamiltonian as

H = H(λ0, λ, x, u) = λ0 + hλ, f (x) + ug(x)i.

Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle for time-optimal processes [7] pro-
vides the following necessary conditions for optimality:

Theorem 1 (Maximum principle):

[7] Let (x∗(t), u∗(t)) be a
time-optimal controlled trajectory that transfers the initial condition
x(0) = x0 into the terminal state x(T ) = xT . Then it is a necessary
condition for optimality that there exists a constant λ0 ≤ 0 and
nonzero, absolutely continuous row vector function λ(t) such that:

1) λ satisﬁes the so-called adjoint equation

˙λ(t) = −

∂H
∂x

(λ0, λ(t), x∗(t), u∗(t))

its maximum over the control set U at u = u∗(t).

2) For 0 ≤ t ≤ T the function u 7→ H(λ0, λ(t), x∗(t), u) attains
3) H(λ0, λ(t), x∗(t), u∗(t)) ≡ 0.
We call a controlled trajectory (x, u) for which there exist multi-
pliers λ0 and λ(t) such that these conditions are satisﬁed an extremal.
Extremals for which λ0 = 0 are called abnormal. If λ0 < 0, then
without loss of generality we may rescale the λ’s and set λ0 = −1.
Such an extremal is called normal.

For the system (27), (28) we have

H(λ0, λ, x, u) = λ0 + λ1x2 + λ2(cid:18) 1

1 − x1u(cid:19) ,

x3

and thus

˙λ = −λ 

0

−(u + 3/x4
1)

1

0 ! = −λA

Observe that H is a linear function of the bounded control variable
u. The coefﬁcient at u in H is −λ2x1 and, since x1 > 0, its sign is

(34)

(35)

determined by Φ = −λ2, the so-called switching function. According
to the maximum principle, point 2 above, the optimal control is given
by u = u1 if Φ < 0 and by u = u2 if Φ > 0. The maximum
principle provides a priori no information about the control at times
t when the switching function Φ vanishes. However, if Φ(t) = 0 and
˙Φ(t) 6= 0, then at time t the control switches between its boundary
values and we call this a bang-bang switch. If Φ were to vanish
identically over some open time interval I the corresponding control
is called singular.

Proposition 1: For Problem 2 optimal controls are bang-bang.

Proof: Whenever the switching function Φ(t) = −λ2(t) van-
ishes at some time t, then it follows from the non-triviality of the
multiplier λ(t) that its derivative ˙Φ(t) = − ˙λ2(t) = λ1(t) is non-
zero. Hence the switching function changes sign and there is a bang-
bang switch at time t.

Deﬁnition 1: We denote the vector ﬁelds corresponding to the
constant bang controls u1 and u2 by X = f +u1g and Y = f +u2g,
respectively, and call the trajectories corresponding to the constant
controls u ≡ u1 and u ≡ u2 X- and Y -trajectories. A concatenation
of an X-trajectory followed by a Y -trajectory is denoted by XY
while the concatenation in the inverse order is denoted by Y X.

We next show that all the extremals of the problem are normal.

We use the following lemma:

Lemma 1: An X-trajectory starting from (α, 0), 0 < α ≤ 1, meets
the x1-axis at a point (β, 0) with β > γ. A Y -trajectory starting from
(β, 0), β ≥ 1, meets the x1-axis at a point (α, 0) with α ≤ 1.
Proof: For an X-trajectory (u = u1) starting from (α, 0) it is
not hard to verify, using the system equations, the following constant
of the motion

x2
2 + u1x2

α2 .

(36)

For x2 = 0 the above equation has two solutions for x1: α, corre-

sponding to the starting point, and β = 1/(α√u1). But u1 ≤ 1/γ 4
from (31) and α ≤ 1 from lemma hypothesis, thus β ≥ γ 2 > γ,
since additionally γ > 1. Analogously, a ﬁrst integral of the motion
along the Y -trajectory (u = u2) starting from (β, 0) is

2 + u2x2
x2

1 +

1
x2

= u2β2 +

β2 .

(37)

For x2 = 0 we obtain two values for x1, β (starting point) and

α = 1/(β√u2). But β ≥ 1 and u2 ≥ 1, thus α ≤ 1.

Proposition 2: All the extremals are normal.

Proof: If (x, u) is an abnormal extremal

trajectory with a
switching at t = t0, then, since λ2(t0) = 0, it follows from H = 0
that it is also x2(t0) = 0. Thus, for abnormal extremals, all the
switchings take place on the x1-axis. Suppose now that the system
starts from (α1 = 1, 0) with an X-segment (u = u1). This trajectory
meets again the x1-axis at a point (β1, 0), where β1 > γ > 1,
according to the above lemma. At this point there is a switching to
u = u2, otherwise the system returns to the starting point. The Y -
segment starting from (β1, 0), β1 > 1, meets again the x1-axis at a
point (α2, 0), where α2 < 1, according to the lemma. By repeating
this procedure, we observe that the abnormal extremal trajectory is
passing from x1-axis only through points (αi, 0), (βi, 0), with αi < 1
and βi > γ, thus it can never reach the target point (γ, 0). The
proof is analogous when the trajectory starts with a Y -segment from
(β1 = 1, 0).

For normal extremals we can set λ0 = −1. Then, H = 0 implies
that for any switching time t0 we must have λ1(t0)x2(t0) = 1. For
an XY junction we have ˙Φ(t0) = λ1(t0) > 0 and thus necessarily
x2(t0) > 0 and analogously optimal Y X junctions need to lie in
{x2 < 0}. In the following, we establish the precise concatenation

sequences for optimal controls and in particular calculate the times
between switchings explicitly.

Note that the inter-switching times depend only on the ratio x2/x1.
Proof: These formulas are obtained as an application of the
concept of a “conjugate point” for bang-bang controls [39], [40].
The proof is the same as in [20], but for completeness we repeat
here the main steps. Without loss of generality assume that
the
trajectory passes through P at
time τ .
Since P and Q are switching points, the corresponding multipli-
ers vanish against the control vector ﬁeld g at those points, i.e.,
hλ(0), g(P )i = hλ(τ ), g(Q)i = 0. We need to compute what the
relation hλ(τ ), g(Q)i = 0 implies at time 0. In order to do so, we
move the vector g(Q) along the Y -trajectory backward from Q to P .
This is done by means of the solution w(t) of the variational equation
along the Y -trajectory with terminal condition w(τ ) = g(Q) at time
τ . Recall that the variational equation along Y is the linear system
˙w = Aw where matrix A is given in (35). Symbolically, if we denote
by etY (P ) the value of the Y -trajectory at time t that starts at the
point P at time 0 and by (e−tY )∗ the backward evolution under
the linear differential equation ˙w = Aw, then we can represent this
solution in the form

w(0) = (e−τ Y )∗w(τ ) = (e−τ Y )∗g(Q)

= (e−τ Y )∗g(eτ Y (P )) = (e−τ Y )∗ ◦ g ◦ eτ Y (P ).

Since the “adjoint equation” of the Maximum Principle is precisely
the adjoint equation to the variational equation, it follows that the
function t 7→ hλ(t), w(t)i is constant along the Y -trajectory. Hence
hλ(τ ), g(Q)i = 0 implies that

hλ(0), w(0)i = hλ(0), (e−τ Y )∗g(eτ Y (P ))i = 0

as well. But the non-zero two-dimensional multiplier λ(0) can only
be orthogonal to both g(P ) and w(0) if these vectors are parallel,
g(P )kw(0) = (e−τ Y )∗g(eτ Y (P )). It is this relation that deﬁnes the
switching time.
It remains to compute w(0). For this we make use of the well-

known relation [32]

(e−τ Y )∗ ◦ g ◦ eτ Y = eτ adY (g)

(40)

where the operator adY is deﬁned as adY (g) = [Y, g], with [, ]
denoting the Lie bracket of the vector ﬁelds Y and g. For our system,

In the following Theorem 2, which is the main result of the paper,
we use Lemma 3 to determine the exact form of the extremals, and
Lemmas 2 and 4 to calculate the corresponding times to reach the
target point.

Theorem 2: The extremal

trajectories can only have the form
XY X . . . XY , with an odd number of switchings, or the form
Y XY . . . XY , with an even number of switchings. The necessary
time to reach the target point (γ, 0), γ > 1, with the extremal

from which (38) follows.

For an X-trajectory we simply replace u2 with u1 and obtain (39).

Lemma 3 (Main technical point): The ratio of the coordinates of
consecutive switching points has constant magnitude but alternating
sign, while these points are not symmetric with respect to the x1-axis.
Proof: Consider the trajectory XY XY shown in Fig. 1 with
switching points (κ, µ), (ζ, ξ) and (λ, ν), where blue solid curves
correspond to X-segments (u = u1) and red dashed curves to Y -
segments (u = u2). If we follow [20] then, starting from (κ, µ)
and integrating the equations of motion (27) and (28) for the inter-
switching time given in (38), we can ﬁnd the coordinates of the next
switching point and show that ξ/ζ = −µ/κ while (ζ, ξ) 6= (κ, −µ).
Subsequently, integrating the equations for the inter-switching time
given in (39), we can also show that ν/λ = −ξ/ζ and (λ, ν) 6=
(ζ,−ξ).
Here we present a more elegant proof based on the symme-
tries of the system. Observe that the transformation (t, x1, x2) →
(−t, x1,−x2) leaves the system (27) and (28) invariant for constant
u. So, starting from (ζ,−ξ) and running the transformed system
forward in time, we arrive at
the next switching point (κ, µ),
which is the point encountered when running the original system
backward in time. The switching time is given again by (38), with
x1 = ζ, x2 = −ξ. But this switching time is the same when running
the original system in the forward direction, with x1 = κ, x2 = µ in
(38). Equating the sine and cosine terms in (38) for the forward and
backward directions, we obtain

(u2ζκ + ξµ)(ξκ + ζµ) = 0,

(43)
The above equations are both satisﬁed when ξ/ζ = −µ/κ. Note that
it is (ζ, ξ) 6= (κ,−µ), otherwise the trajectory would return to the

(ξκ − ζµ)(ξκ + ζµ) = 0.

Proof: Consider a trajectory of the form XY X . . . XY with n
turns and 2n + 1 switching points Aj(κj, µj), j = 1, 2, . . . , 2n + 1,
shown in Fig. 2(a). Observe that the odd-numbered switching points
lie on a positive-slope straight
line passing through the origin,
while the even-numbered switching points lie on the symmetric line
with opposite slope, in accordance with Lemma 3. Two consecutive
switching points satisfy the following equation

where u = u1 if the two points are connected with an X-segment and
u = u2 if they are joined with a Y -segment (it can be veriﬁed from
the system equations that the quantity x2
1 is constant
along segments with constant control u). The ratio of the squares
of the coordinates of all the switching points is constant, and if we
denote it by µ2

j = s, then (57) becomes

(60)

(61)

for the even switching points. We show that an extremal starting with
an X-segment cannot also end with an X-segment. If that was true,
then the last switching point would have even numbering (κ2k, µ2k),
leading to a ﬁnal point on the x1-axis with x1(T ) < κ2k. This
happens because at this switching point it is x2 < 0, a negative
velocity according to the particle model from Remark 1, thus the state
of the system moves to smaller x1 for the repulsive force 1/x3
1 in
(28) to reduce the magnitude of the ﬁnal velocity to zero x2(T ) = 0.
From the ordering in (61) we conclude that it is also x1(T ) < κ2.
But the ﬁrst two switching points satisfy (57) with u = u2, since
they are connected with a Y -segment, and if we use the common
ratio µ2
2 are the
roots of the following equation

1 = s, we easily ﬁnd that both κ2

since u2 ≥ 1 and s > 0. The ﬁrst switching point belongs to an
X-segment starting from (1, 0), and one can easily show that

1 ≤ κ1 ≤ 1/√u1,

(64)

where recall that u1 < 1. From (63), (64) we conclude that κ2 < 1,
thus also x1(T ) < κ2 < 1 < γ, and the ﬁnal point (γ, 0) cannot be
reached. Consequently, an extremal starting with an X-segment can
only end with a Y -segment, as we considered at the beginning.

We next move to ﬁnd an equation for the ratio s. If we consec-
utively apply (59) from the ﬁrst switching point up to the last, we
obtain

Since the ﬁrst switching point belongs to the ﬁrst X-segment starting
from (1, 0), it satisﬁes the equation

already meets the x1-axis at another point (α, 0) with α ≤ 1 (in
Fig. 2(a) it is the trajectory point closest to the origin), as explained
in the previous paragraph, thus, from the proof of Lemma 1 it is

β = 1/(α√u1) ≥ 1/√u1 > 1. Solving (68) we ﬁnd

If we choose κ2

2n+1,+, which corresponds to the + sign in the ﬁrst

ordering in (73) we conclude that it is also x1(T ) < κ1. The ﬁrst
switching point belongs to a Y -segment starting from (1, 0), and one
can easily show that

1/√u2 ≤ κ1 ≤ 1,

(75)
where recall that u2 ≥ 1. Thus x1(T ) < κ1 ≤ 1 < γ, and the ﬁnal
point (γ, 0) cannot be reached. Consequently, an extremal starting
with a Y -segment can only end with a Y -segment, as we considered
at the beginning.

If we consecutively apply (59) from the ﬁrst switching point up to

the last, we obtain

equality in (69), then (65) becomes

s + u1(cid:19)n

¯c +p¯c2 − 4(s + u1)

with the ± sign corresponding to κ2
sponding to the + sign in the second equality in (69), and use for κ2
1,±
the second equality in (67), we obtain an equation similar to (70) but
with inverted left hand side. It is ¯c > c1 ⇔ (β2 − 1)(u1β2 − 1) > 0,

and the corresponding transcendental equation has no solution. Since
we actually do not know ¯c (we do not know β) in the valid equation
(70), we will use the fact that the last switching point (κ2n+1, µ2n+1)
belongs to the ﬁnal Y -segment passing from the target point (γ, 0).
Then, κ2

2n+1 =

c +pc2 − 4(s + u2)

2(s + u2)

(72)

Using (72) and the ﬁrst equality of (67) in (65), we obtain the
transcendental equation (52) for the ratio s, where c1, c are given
in (50) and (51), respectively. Note that s is bounded below by the
requirement s > 0 (for s = 0 the switching points would lie on
the x1-axis, which is not the case), and above by the requirements
1 − 4(s + u1) ≥ 0 and c2 − 4(s + u2) ≥ 0, which are both satisﬁed
c2
for s ≤ Min{(1 − u1)2/4, (u2γ 2 − 1/γ 2)2/4}.
Once we have found this ratio, we can calculate the time interval
between consecutive switchings using (48) for an X-segment and
(49) for a Y -segment, relations obtained from Lemma 2 on the inter-
switching time. The difference in the two expressions comes from the
fact that the sines in (38), (39) have opposite signs and in (48), (49)
we use the inverse cosine function with range [0, π]. Observe that
the times along all intermediate X- (respectively Y -) trajectories are
equal. The initial time interval T ±
I,1 from the starting point (1, 0) up
to the ﬁrst switching A1 can be calculated by setting β = 1, u = u1
and x1(T ±
I,1) = κ1,± in (44). The result is given in (46). Analogously,
the ﬁnal time interval TF from the last switching A2n+1 up to the
target point (γ, 0) can be calculated by setting β = γ, u = u2 and
x1(TF ) = κ2n+1 in (44), and the result is given in (47). The total
duration T ±
2n+1 of the trajectory with 2n + 1 switchings joining the
points (1, 0) and (γ, 0) is given by (45), where ± corresponds to the
choice of sign in (67) for the ﬁrst switching point.
Consider now an extremal of the form Y X . . . Y XY with n turns
and 2n switching points (κj , µj ), j = 1, 2, . . . , 2n, shown in Fig.
2(b). If we follow a procedure similar to the one above we ﬁnd

for the even switching points. We next show that a trajectory
starting with a Y -segment cannot end with an X-segment. If that
was the case, the last switching point would have odd number-
ing (κ2k+1, µ2k+1), leading to a ﬁnal point on the x1-axis with
x1(T ) < κ2k+1, since at the switching point x2 < 0 and the state
of the system moves to smaller x1 for the repulsive force 1/x3
1 to
reduce the magnitude of the velocity to zero x2(T ) = 0. From the

2n,+ leads
(γ 2 − 1)(u2γ 2 − 1) > 0 which is true, only the choice κ2
to a valid transcendental equation. Note that in order to exclude the
2n,−, one has to use in (76) the corresponding expression
choice κ2
1,± the expression from
from the second equality in (78) and for κ2
the ﬁrst equality in (77). If we use in (76) for κ2
2n,+ the ﬁrst equality
in (78) and for κ2
1,± the second equality in (77), we end up with
the valid transcendental equation (56) for the ratio s, in the interval
0 < s ≤ (u2−1)2/4, since u2−1 < u2γ 2−1/γ 2 for γ > 1. Having
found s, the interswitching times TX, TY are given by (48), (49),
as above. The initial time interval T ±
I,2 can be calculated following
the same procedure as before and the result is given in (54), while
the ﬁnal time interval TF is the same as in the previous case and
is given in (47). The total duration T ±
2n of the trajectory with 2n
switchings joining the points (1, 0) and (γ, 0) is given by (53), where
± corresponds to the choice of sign in (77) for the ﬁrst switching
point.
Using Theorem 2 we can ﬁnd the times Tn for a speciﬁc target
(γ, 0) and compare them to obtain the minimum time. Some exam-
ples are given in the next section.

Corollary 1: For u2 = 1, only extremals of

the form

XY . . . Y XY with odd number of switchings are allowed.

Proof: For u = u2 = 1 the starting point (1, 0) is an equilibrium
point of system (27), (28), so a trajectory cannot start with a Y -
segment. Note that for u2 = 1, the upper bound for the allowed
values of s in the transcendental equation (56) is (u2 − 1)2/4 = 0,
same as the lower bound.
Remark 2: The major consequence of Theorem 2 is the possibility
of odd-numbered extremals with more than one switchings for u2 =
1. In the next section we present an example where such an extremal
is actually the optimal solution. This kind of solution is not mentioned
in any of the previous works [9], [21], [22], [33]–[35].

Remark 3: Solving numerically the transcendental equations for
the ratio s and then calculating the switching times using the formulas
in Theorem 2, is computationally more efﬁcient than the numerical
optimization over the switching times which is suggested in [21].

IV. EXAMPLES

In this section we illustrate the optimal solution described in
Theorem 2 with several examples. For convenience we ﬁx the lower

control bound to u1 = 0.0002 and consider four cases with the
following realistic values of γ and u2: (a) γ = √3, u2 = 1, (b)
γ = √3, u2 = 6.5, (c) γ = 8, u2 = 1, (d) γ = 8, u2 = 4.
For example, in the experiment [41] where the fast but effectively
adiabatic cooling of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate is consid-
ered, the ratio of the initial to the ﬁnal frequency is approximately
ω0/ωf = 3, corresponding to γ = √3. In Table I we show for each
of these cases the necessary times for the various extremals to reach
the corresponding target point. These times result from Theorem 2,
by solving numerically the corresponding transcendental equations
and subsequently using the formulas for the switching times. The
absence of a solution is denoted by -, while the minimum time for
each case is highlighted with bold.
Observe that for the ﬁrst case (ﬁrst column), where γ = √3, u2 =
1, there is only one extremal, and recall that the extremals starting
with a Y -segment are excluded because u2 = 1, as explained in
Corollary 1. The corresponding optimal trajectory XY is depicted in
Fig. 3(a). For the next case (b), the target point is the same as before
but the control upper bound has been increased to u2 = 6.5. Table
I indicates that the minimum-time solution has two switchings, and
the corresponding trajectory Y XY is shown in Fig. 3(b). This kind
of solution can be better understood if we adopt the point of view
of Remark 1 and interpret system (27), (28) as describing the one-
dimensional Newtonian motion of a unit-mass particle, with x1, x2
corresponding to its position and velocity, respectively. If u2 is large
enough then the particle, instead of moving solely forward like in the
XY trajectory, can ﬁrst approach x1 = 0 sufﬁciently fast and then
exploit the strong repulsive force 1/x3
1 to arrive faster at the target
point. We identiﬁed this type of solution in [20], in the more general
case where the control could also take negative values, but it was
also veriﬁed numerically in [21] for the restrictive case of positive
controls.

We now move to the next example, where γ = 8, u2 = 1. As in
case (a), the extremals starting with Y , having an even number of
switching points, are excluded because of Corollary 1. But, since the
target point γ is now larger than in the previous case, odd-numbered
extremals with more than one switchings arise, which take advantage
of the strong repulsive force close to x1 = 0. In fact, the optimal
solution is XY XY with three switchings, as highlighted in Table I
and portrayed in Fig. 3(c). We emphasize that this is a new kind of
solution, absent from the previous works [9], [21], [22], [33]–[35].
These articles actually consider the case 0 < ωf = ω1 ≤ ω(t) ≤

Fig. 3. Optimal trajectories for various values of the target γ and the control
upper bound u2. The lower bound is ﬁxed to u2 = 0.0002 for all the cases.

ω2 = ω0, which corresponds to 0 < 1/γ 4 = u1 ≤ u(t) ≤ u2 = 1
in our terminology. For such restrictions in the frequency (stiffness)
of the parametric oscillator, these papers conclude that the optimal
solution has three “jumps”. This actually corresponds to our XY
solution with one (intermediate) switching, since in the number of
jumps are included the changes at the initial and ﬁnal times. In this
language, our optimal solution with three (intermediate) switchings
corresponds to a ﬁve-jump solution. Note that in our example we use
u1 = 0.0002, instead of u1 = 1/γ 4 = 2.44 · 10−4, but it can be
veriﬁed that even in this case the optimal solution is again of the
form XY XY with three switchings. The crucial requirement for the
validity of the comparison is u2 = 1 on the upper bound, which
assures that the even-numbered extremals are excluded, and not that
on the lower bound [21]. We ﬁnally mention that in our previous
work [20] we didn’t identify odd-numbered solutions with more than
one switchings since, for the control set that we considered there,
−u1 ≤ u(t) ≤ u2 with u1, u2 ≥ 1, this kind of extremals was
excluded.
The last case that we examine has the same target point γ = 8 but
a larger control upper bound u2 = 4. As we can observe from Table
I the optimal solution has four switchings, and the form YXYXY
which is shown in Fig. 3(d). Going back to the particle picture, we
see that for these values of the parameters it is time-optimal to move
back and forth twice in order to gain speed from the repulsive force,
before reaching the target point. We close by pointing out that, using
(22) and (26), the optimal trajectories shown in Fig. 3 can be easily
displayed on the z1z2-plane, as in [21].

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we used geometric optimal control

to ﬁnd the
minimum necessary time for transitions between thermal states of the
quantum parametric oscillator, and the corresponding optimal time-
proﬁle of oscillator’s frequency. We considered the case where the
frequency of the oscillator can take only real values, corresponding
to nonnegative oscillator stiffness, and obtained a solution which has
not appeared in any of the previous related works. The present work
can ﬁnd applications in several contexts, for example to minimize
the necessary time for the adiabatic stroke of a quantum heat
engine and for the effectively adiabatic cooling of trapped atoms,
reducing though the undesirable effect of random interactions with
the environment, which is ubiquitous. In the future, we would like

Dionisis Stefanatos (M’11) was born in the Greek
island of Cephalonia in 1977. He received the
Diploma in Electrical Engineering with highest hon-
ors from NTU Athens and the PhD in Engineering
Sciences from Harvard, where he was a co-recipient
of the E. Jury best thesis award (2005). He has held
postdoctoral positions at Harvard and Washington
University in St. Louis, while currently is temporary
lecturer in Physics at the Hellenic Army Academy
in Athens. His research is focused on the study of
control systems that arise from physical problems

and especially quantum mechanical applications.

to apply a similar control theoretic approach to two systems that we
have recently studied numerically: a quantum parametric oscillator
with noise, which is a good model for a noisy quantum heat engine
[11], and two coupled oscillators with modulation in their coupling,
which models pulsed cavity optomechanical cooling [42].
