CONTINUOUS COCYCLE SUPERRIGIDITY FOR SHIFTS AND

GROUPS WITH ONE END

NHAN-PHU CHUNG AND YONGLE JIANG

Abstract. In this article, we prove that if a ﬁnitely generated group G is not
torsion then a necessary and suﬃcient condition for every full shift over G has
(continuous) cocycle superrigidity is that G has one end. It is a topological version
of the well known Popa’s measurable cocycle superrigidity theorem. For the proof
of suﬃcient condition, we heavily use and extend the method using speciﬁcation
properties and homoclinic equivalence relation that was introduced by Schmidt to
study cocycle rigidity for Zd-shifts [45]. And for the converse, we apply Specker’s
characterization for ends of groups via the associated ﬁrst cohomology groups to
get the result. Finally, combining our results with [30, Theorem 1.6], we have an
application in continuous orbit equivalence rigidity.

1. Introduction

Since its introduction [11,46], measurable orbit equivalence has received a tremen-
dous attention not only from ergodic theorist but also analysts working on operator
algebras. It is well-known that in the measurable setting (see e.g.[14, Section 3.3],
[42, Theorem 5.6], [49, Sections 4.2.9 and 4.2.11]) it is a general principle that,
roughly speaking, cocycle superrigidity implies orbit equivalence superrigidity. Re-
cently, using this principle and deformation/rigidity techniques in von Neumann
algebras, many rigidity results for measurable orbit equivalence were established for
certain actions of a large class of non-amenable groups [23, 42, 43]. One of the break-
through papers in this direction is Popa’s measurable orbit equivalence superrigidity
results which were obtained via his celebrated measurable cocycle superrigidity the-
orem [41–43].

A subgroup G0 of G is wq-normal if there exists no subgroup G0 ≤ H (cid:0) G with

gHg−1 ∩ H is ﬁnite for all g ∈ G \ H.

Popa’s measurable cocycle superrigidity theorem: [42,43] Let G be a group
that contains an inﬁnite wq-normal subgroup G0 such that the pair (G, G0) has
relative property (T ), or such that G0 is the direct product of an inﬁnite group and

a non-amenable group. Then the full shift action G yQG(A, µ) is Uf in-measurable

cocycle superrigid, for every ﬁnite set A.

Here Uf in is the class of Polish groups which arise as closed subgroups of the
unitary groups of ﬁnite von Neumann algebras. The class Uf in contains compact
Polish groups and countable groups.

On the other side, the interplay between continuous orbit equivalence and C ∗-
algebras has been investigated extensively in the last 20 years. Although some
fundamental progress in continuous orbit equivalence has been made just for some
special cases, it already has had many applications in groupoids, homology theory,
classiﬁcation of C*-algebras, and K-theory [2, 3, 5, 17–19, 25, 30, 32–37]. Similar to
the measurable setting, continuous cocycles of a continuous group action are a fun-
damental tool for understanding the action. And it is natural to ask whether there
is a continuous version of Popa’s measurable cocycle superrigidity theorem and how
one can apply it to study rigidity of continuous orbit equivalence.

We denote by G the class of ﬁnitely generated inﬁnite discrete group G such that
the full shift (G, AG) is continuous H-cocycle rigid for every ﬁnite set A and every
countable discrete group H, i.e. every continuous cocycle c : G × AG → H is
continuously cohomologous to a group homomorphism φ : G → H. Which group G
belongs to G?

In [26,27], during studying classiﬁcation of the isometric extensions of Zd- Bernoulli
shifts, J. W. Kammeyer implicitly proved that when d ≥ 2, every continuous cocycle
for the shift action of Zd on the full d-dimensional k-shift with values in Z/2Z is
continuously cohomologous to a homomorphism from Zd to Z/2Z, i.e. the full shift
(Zd, AZd) is continuous Z/2Z-cocycle rigid for all ﬁnite set A. Later, K. Schmidt
proved that when d ≥ 2, the full shift (Zd, AZd) is continuous H-cocycle rigid for
every ﬁnite set A and every discrete group H; hence Zd belongs to G when d ≥ 2
[45]. As far as we know, these were the only known groups in G.

Last year, Xin Li proved that the full shift (G, AG) is continuous H-cocycle rigid
when the acting group G is a torsion-free, duality group with cohomological dimen-
sion not equal to one and the target group H is solvable [30, Theorem 1.7].

Inspired by the work of Schmidt [45] and Li [30], in this article we give a necessary
and suﬃcient condition for a non-torsion group G, i.e. G contains at least one
element with inﬁnite order, to be a member in G via the ends of the group, an
important notion in geometric group theory.

Now, we state our main results. From now on the acting group G is always ﬁnitely
generated. First, we establish continuous cocycle rigidity result for certain shifts of
ﬁnite type.

Theorem 1.1. Let A be a ﬁnite set and G a non-torsion group. Let σ be the left shift
action of G on AG and X ⊂ AG be a subshift. Assume that σ is topological mixing,
and the homoclinic equivalence relation ∆X has strong a-speciﬁcation, for every
element a in G with inﬁnite order. If G has one end then every continuous cocycle
c : G × X → H on every countable group H is cohomologous to a homomorphism.

Second, we illustrate that for a ﬁnitely generated group G (not necessary non-

torsion), one end is a necessary condition for G belonging to G.

Theorem 1.2. If G has more than one end, then (G, ( Z
cocycle rigid.

2Z)G) is not continuous Z
2Z -

CONTINUOUS COCYCLE SUPERRIGIDITY FOR SHIFTS AND GROUPS WITH ONE END 3

As a consequence, we get

Corollary 1.3. If G is (ﬁnitely generated and) not a torsion group, then G ∈ G if
and only if G has one end.

We recall that motivated by his measurable cocycle superrigidity theorem, Popa
asked the question whether G satisﬁes measurable cocycle superrigidity theorem for
Bernoulli shift actions if and only if (the nonamenable group) G has zero ﬁrst ℓ2-
Betti number [39, p. 251]. For results on this question, we refer the reader to [39].
Note that when a nonamenable group has zero ﬁrst ℓ2-Betti number, then it has one
end (see Example 2.8). Thus, our result might be considered as a solution to the
counterpart of Popa’s question in the continuous setting.

Now let us describe brieﬂy our main ideas in the proof of Theorem 1.1 which is
based on the method used in [45]. In fact, our Lemmas 2.5, 3.5 and 4.1 are proved
with the same techniques that Schmidt proved [45, Proposition 3.1 and Theorem
3.2].

Suppose we are given a continuous cocycle c : G × X → H, where X ⊂ AG
is a subshift for some ﬁnite set A, and we want to show there exist a continuous
map b : X → H and a group homomorphism φ : G → H such that c(g, x) =
b(gx)φ(g)b(x)−1 for all g ∈ G and all x ∈ X. The key problem is to construct the
“mysterious” transfer map (also called untwister) b.

In the ﬁrst step, we show that the above equality holds for any non-torsion el-
If φ(g) = b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x) for all x in X, then

ement g in G and all x ∈ X.
b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x) = b(gx′)−1c(g, x′)b(x′) for all (x, x′) ∈ X × X.

Denote by f (gkx) = c(g, gkx) for all k ∈ Z, then the above equality implies
b(gk+1x)b(gk+1x′)−1 = f (gkx)b(gkx)b(gkx′)−1f (gkx′)−1 for all (x, x′) ∈ X × X and
all k ∈ Z, which can be viewed as a recurrence relation, then repeating substitution,
we get

b(x)b(x′)−1 = (

b(x)b(x′)−1 = (

kYj=0
kYj=1

kYj=0

f (gjx)−1)b(gk+1x)b(gk+1x′)−1(

f (gjx′)−1)−1,

f (g−jx))b(g−kx)b(g−kx′)−1(

f (g−jx′))−1

for all k ≥ 0 and all (x, x′) ∈ X × X.

Then, the continuity of b implies that when x, x′ have the same “tails” (i.e.
they lie in the homoclinic equivalence relation) , then b(gk+1x)b(gk+1x′)−1 = e =
b(g−kx)b(g−kx′)−1 for large enough k. So the above equality implies for large enough
k, we have

b(x)b(x′)−1 = (

kYj=0

f (gjx)−1)(

kYj=0

f (gjx′)−1)−1 = (

kYj=1

f (g−jx))(

kYj=1

f (g−jx′))−1.

4

If we further ﬁx x′, then, b(x) is already determined by these relations; however, in
general, there is no reason to expect for large enough k,

(

kYj=0

f (gjx)−1)(

kYj=0

f (gjx′)−1)−1 = (

kYj=1

f (g−jx))(

kYj=1

f (g−jx′))−1,

so the diﬃculties lie in ﬁnding conditions on G to make this equality holds and
make the above “argument” actually work for all x ∈ X. We prove that G being
(non-torsion) one-ended is the key to overcome these diﬃculties. This is done in
Corollary 2.10, Lemmas 3.5, and 4.1.

In the second step, we show that when G has one end, we can get a common b for
all non-torsion element “g” we used in the ﬁrst step, and in fact this transfer map
b also works for the whole group G. It follows from Lemmas 4.3 and 2.5.

The deﬁnition of speciﬁcation property in Deﬁnition 3.1, Lemma 2.5 and Corollary
2.10 are the key ingredients for us to extend Schmidt’s results on Zd in [45] to groups
with one end.

The paper is organized as following: in Section 2, we study continuous cocycle of
subshifts via homoclinic equivalence relation as Schmidt did when the acting group
is Zd [45]. In Section 3, we introduced two versions of speciﬁcation properties for
subshifts over general groups. These properties play crucial roles in our paper. In
Section 4, we combine preparation results in Sections 2 and 3 to give a proof for
Theorem 1.1, and we provide the generalized golden mean subshifts as a rich source
for Theorem 1.1. In Section 5, we present proofs of Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 1.3
by using a cohomological characterization of numbers of ends of groups in [10,22,47].
Note that this idea was also already used to study algebraic actions recently [29].
Finally, we combine our results with [30, Theorem 1.6] to obtain continuous orbit
equivalence rigidity of some actions of certain torsion-free amenable groups.

Some of results and techniques also hold when the target group has a compatible
bi-invariant metric, meaning that they also work for groups in Uf in. For simplicity,
in this article, we only deal with subshifts and discrete target groups.

2. Continuous cocyle, ends of groups, and homoclinic equivalence

relation

2.1. Cocycle rigidity. Let G be a countable group and act on a compact topolog-
ical space X by homeomorphisms and we denote this dynamical system by (G, X).
Let H be a topological group.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A continuous H-cocycle for the system (G, X) is a map c : G×X →
H such that c(g, ·) : X → H is continuous for every g ∈ G and

for all g1, g2 ∈ G, x ∈ X.

c(g1g2, x) = c(g1, g2x)c(g2, x),

CONTINUOUS COCYCLE SUPERRIGIDITY FOR SHIFTS AND GROUPS WITH ONE END 5

If ρ : G → H is a homomorphism then clearly the map G × X → H, (g, x) 7→ ρ(g)

which we still denote by ρ is a continuous cocycle.

Let b : X → H be a continuous map and c : G × X → H be a continuous H-
cocycle then the map c′ : G × X → H deﬁned by c′(g, x) := b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x) is
also a continuous H-cocycle.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Two continuous H-cocycles c, c′ : G × X → H are cohomologous if
there exists a continuous map b : X → H called a transfer map such that c(g, x) =
b(gx)−1c′(g, x)b(x) for every x ∈ X, g ∈ G.

We say a continuous H-cocycle c : G × X → H is trivial if it is cohomologous to

a homomorphism from G to H.

Deﬁnition 2.3. A system (G, X) is called continuous H-cocycle rigid if every con-
tinuous H-cocycle c : G × X → H is cohomologous to a homomorphism ρ : G → H.
We say the system (G, X) is superrigid if (G, X) is continuous H-cocycle rigid for
every discrete group H.

A metric d on a topological group H is bi-invariant if d(gx, gy) = d(x, y) =
d(xg, yg), for every x, y, g ∈ H. Note that if d is a bi-invariant metric on H then

i=1 d(xi, yi), for every n ∈ N, x1, · · · , xn, y1, · · · , yn ∈ H.

d(x1 · · · xn, y1 · · · yn) ≤Pn

Deﬁnition 2.4. The dynamical system (G, X) is topological mixing if G is inﬁnite
and for every two non-empty open subsets U, V of X, there exists a ﬁnite subset F
of G such that gU ∩ V 6= ∅ for every g ∈ G \ F . It is topological mixing of order
r if G is inﬁnite and for all nonempty open subsets U1, · · · , Ur of X, there exists a
ﬁnite subset F of G such that ∩1≤i≤rgiUi 6= ∅ whenever g1, · · · , gr are elements of
G such that g−1

i gj 6∈ F for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r.

The measurable version of the following lemma is well-known, see e.g. [15, Lemma

3.5], [42, Lemma 3.6]. Its proof is inspired by [45, Theorem 3.2].

Lemma 2.5. Let G be a countable group and α be an action of G on a compact
metrizable space X by homeomorphisms. Let H be a topological group with a bi-
invariant metric d on H. Let c : G × X → H be a continuous H-cocycle. Assume
that there exists a subgroup G0 < G and a continuous map b : X → H such that
for any ﬁxed g in G0 the map x 7→ b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x) is constant on X, and α|G0 is
topological mixing. Then c : NG(G0)×X → H is cohomologous to a homomorphism,
where NG(G0) is the normalizer of G0 in G.
Proof. Let c′
: G × X → H be a continuous H-cocycle deﬁned by c′(g, x) :=
b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x), for every g ∈ G, x ∈ X. Fix g0 ∈ G0, let L(g0) be the com-
mon value of b(g0x)−1c(g0, x)b(x) for all x ∈ X.

First we claim for any ﬁxed g ∈ NG(G0), c′(g, ·) is constant on X.
Fix g ∈ NG(G0), and we denote by g′
0)c′(g, g0x)L(g0) = b(gx)−1c−1(g′
= b(gx)−1c−1(g′

0 = gg0g−1 ∈ G0.

= b(gx)−1c−1(g′
= b(gx)−1c−1(g′
= b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x)
= c′(g, x).

And hence for every g ∈ NG(G0), x ∈ X, g0 ∈ G0, one has

(1)

c′(g, x) = L−1(gg0g−1)c′(g, g0x)L(g0).

Let g ∈ NG(G0) and put ϕ(·) = c′(g, ·). Suppose that ϕ is not constant, then
there exist ε > 0, h1, h2 ∈ H, and non-empty open subsets U1, U2 of X such that
supx∈Ui d(ϕ(x), hi) < ε, for every i = 1, 2, and d(h1, h2) > 4ε. Since α|G0 is topo-
6= ∅
logically mixing, there exists a ﬁnite subset F of G0 such that g0U1 ∩ Ui
for every g0 ∈ G0 \ F and i = 1, 2. Therefore, there exist yi ∈ g0U1 ∩ Ui, so
d(ϕ(g−1
0 yi), h1) < ε and d(ϕ(yi), hi) < ε, for every i = 1, 2. And hence from (1), one
has d(L−1(gg0g−1)ϕ(yi)L(g0), h1) < ε for every i = 1, 2. Thus, since d is bi-invariant
we have

d(h1, h2) ≤ d(h2, ϕ(y2)) + d(ϕ(y2), ϕ(y1)) + d(ϕ(y1), h1)

< 2ε + d(L−1(gg0g−1)ϕ(y2)L(g0), L−1(gg0g−1)ϕ(y1)L(g0))
≤ 2ε + d(L−1(gg0g−1)ϕ(y2)L(g0), h1) + d(h1, L−1(gg0g−1)ϕ(y1)L(g0))
< 4ε (contradiction).

Thus ϕ is constant, and we may write L(g) = c′(g, ·) when g ∈ NG(G0).

Now it suﬃces to prove that L is a homomorphism on NG(G0).
For any g1, g2 in NG(G0), one has

L(g1g2) = b(g1g2x)−1c(g1g2, x)b(x)

= b(g1g2x)−1c(g1, g2x)b(g2x)b(g2x)−1c(g2, x)b(x)
= L(g1)L(g2)

Remark 2.6.

(1) If H is discrete, then the discrete metric d deﬁned on H by

d(x, y) = 1 if x 6= y and 0 otherwise is a bi-invariant metric.

(2) If H is a compact metrizable group then there exists a bi-invariant metric on

H [12, Lemma C.2].

2.2. Ends of groups. We recall that a map ϕ : X → Y between topological spaces
is called to be proper if ϕ−1(K) is compact for every compact subset K of Y . A
ray in a topological space X is a map ϕ : [0, ∞) → X. Two continuous proper rays
ϕ1, ϕ2 : [0, ∞) → X are said to have the same end if for every compact subset K
of X, there exists N ∈ N such that ϕ1([N, ∞)) and ϕ2([N, ∞)) are contained in
the same path components of X \ K. This deﬁnes an equivalence relation on the
set of continuous proper rays of X and we denote by End(X) the set of all such
equivalence classes. If |End(X)| = k, we say that X has k ends.

Deﬁnition 2.7. Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group with S is a ﬁnitely generating
set. Let X be its Cayley graph with respect to S. We deﬁne the set of ends of the
group G, End(G) := End(X).

It is known that End(G) does not depend on the choice of the ﬁnite generating
set S and every group G has either 0, 1, 2, or inﬁnitely many ends. Morever, G has
0 ends if and only if G is ﬁnite, 2 ends if and only if it has a subgroup of ﬁnite index
isomorphic to Z, and according to Stallings’ Ends Theorem [48], G has inﬁnitely
many ends if and only if G = A ∗C B or G = A∗ϕ with |A/C| ≥ 3, |B/C| ≥ 2
and ϕ is an isomorphism between ﬁnite subgroups having index ≥ 2 in A. These
properties mentioned above may be found in [16, Section 13.5], [21, Section IV.25.vi]
or [4, Theorem I.8.32], and reference therein.

Now we present several examples of groups with one end, the class of groups that

we use in this paper.

Example 2.8.

(1) Every amenable group that is not virtually cyclic has one end

(applying Stalling’s theorem [48], or see [38] for a short proof ).
Before discussing of the next example, let us review the deﬁnition of 1-cocycle.
Let G be a countably inﬁnite group and M a left ZG-module. An 1-cocyle
c : G → M is a map satisfying

c(gh) = c(g) + gc(h),

for every g, h ∈ G. An 1-cocycle c : G → M is a coboundary if there exists an
m ∈ M such that c(g) = m − gm for every g ∈ G. We denote by Z 1(G, M)
and B1(G, M) the space of 1-cocycles and coboundaries, respectively. The
quotient space Z 1(G, M)/B1(G, M) is called the ﬁrst cohomology of the group
G with coeﬃcients in M and is denoted by H 1(G, M).

(2) If a nonamenable group G has zero ﬁrst ℓ2-Betti number, then it has one

end.

Proof. From [40, Corollary 2.4], we know that H 1(G, ℓ2(G)) = 0. Then
applying the Remark after Proposition 1 in [1], one has H 1(G, ZG) = 0,
which is equivalent to that G has one end [22, Theorem 4.6] (see also [16,
Theorem 13.5.5]).

2.3. Homoclinic equivalence relation in shifts. Let A be a ﬁnite set. The space
AG := {x : G → A} endowed with the product topology is a compact metrizable
space. The group G acts on AG by the left shifts deﬁned by (gx)h := xg−1h, for every
g, h ∈ G, x ∈ AG. A subshift is a closed G-invariant subset of AG. Let X ⊂ AG be
a subshift. For a nonempty ﬁnite subset F of G and x ∈ AG, we denote by xF the
restriction of x to F , and deﬁne XF := {xF : x ∈ X}. If F = {g} for some g ∈ G,
we write it simply as xg. Let R ⊂ X × X be an equivalence relation on X. For
every x ∈ X, we denote by R(x) the equivalence class of x consisting of all y ∈ X
such that (x, y) ∈ R. A map c : R → H is a cocycle if

c(x1, x2)c(x2, x3) = c(x1, x3) ,∀(x1, x2), (x2, x3) ∈ R.

We consider the homoclinic equivalence relation ∆X ⊂ X × X deﬁned by

∆X := {(x, x′) ∈ X×X : there exists a ﬁnite subset F of G such that xg = x′

g, ∀g ∈ G\F }.

For every x ∈ X, we denote by ∆X (x) the homoclinic equivalence class of x in X.
From now on, G is always a ﬁnitely generated group. Let S be a ﬁnite symmetric
generating set of G. Let ℓS and d be the word length and word metric on G induced
by S, respectively. For every r ≥ 0, we put B(r) := {g ∈ G : ℓS(g) ≤ r}. Assume
that there is an element g ∈ G such that ℓS(gk) → ∞ as k → ∞, equivalently, g has
inﬁnite order in G. Let H be a discrete group and f : X → H be a continuous map.
Then one can deﬁne cocycles c(g),±
: ∆X → H as follows: for every (x, x′) ∈ ∆X,
and m ≥ 1, we deﬁne

f

c(g),+,(m)

f (g−kx)(cid:17)(cid:16) m−1Yk=1

f (gkx′)−1(cid:17)−1
f (g−kx′)(cid:17)−1

.

,

For every (x, x′) ∈ ∆X , there exists a ﬁnite subset F of G such that xh = x′
h for
every h ∈ G \ F . Because H is discrete and f is continuous, there exists a non-
empty ﬁnite subset F1 of G such that f (y) = f (z) for every y, z ∈ X with yF1 = zF1.
Because ℓS(gk) → ∞ as k → ∞, there exists N ∈ N such that g−k 6∈ F F −1
, for
every k ≥ N, i.e. g−kF1 ⊂ G \ F , for every k ≥ N. Thus for every k ≥ N, one has
(gkx)F1 = xg−kF1 = x′

and c : G × X → H is a continuous cocycle with (G, X) being a subshift and H being
a discrete group.
Proof. From the deﬁnition of fg and c(g),+

Since the target group is discrete, actually both limits are obtained for suﬃciently

large n, say for all n > N1.

Now, since (x, y) ∈ ∆X , we may assume xg = yg for all g 6∈ B(r) for some r > 0.
Since S is a ﬁnite set, the target group is discrete and c is a continuous cocycle,
we may ﬁnd a ﬁnite set F ⊂ G such that c(s, x) = c(s, y) for all s ∈ S and all
x, y ∈ X ⊂ AG whenever xF = yF .

Now, pick ℓ > 0 large enough such that F B(r) ⊂ B(ℓ).
Then, since limn→±∞ ℓS(gn) = ∞, limn→±∞ ℓS(hn) = ∞, we may ﬁnd N0 such

that gn, hn 6∈ B(ℓ + ℓS(g) + ℓS(h) + 2) for all |n| > N0.

Fix N > N0, N1.
Observe that there is an ∞-path Pg passing through {gk : k ≤ −N}. Indeed,
write g−1 = t1t2 · · · tℓS(g), where ti ∈ S for all 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓS(g), then we can take Pg to
be the one which starts with g−N , then passes through

g−N t1, g−N t1t2, · · · , g−N t1t2 · · · tℓS (g)−1, g−N −1, g−N −1t1, · · · .

Note that Pg lies outside of B(ℓ) by the choice of N0.
Similarly, we also have an ∞-path Ph passing through {hk : k ≤ −N} which lies

outside of B(ℓ).

Now, since G has one end, both g−N and h−N lie in the unique ∞-connected
component of G \ B(ℓ). This implies there exists a path in G \ B(ℓ) connecting g−N

is symmetric, this is equivalent to say that si · · · s2s1hN 6∈ B(ℓ), for all i = 1, · · · , k

Then, the cocycle identity implies the following:

c(gN , x) = c(sk · · · s1hN , x)

= c(sk, sk−1 · · · s1hN x)c(sk−1, sk−2 · · · s1hN x) · · · c(s1, hN x)c(hN , x).

Now, we claim that c(si, si−1 · · · s1hN x) = c(si, si−1 · · · s1hN y) for all i = 1, · · · , k.

To check this, we only need to show (si−1 · · · s1hN x)F = (si−1 · · · s1hN y)F , or
equivalently, x(si−1···s1hN )−1F = y(si−1···s1hN )−1F for all i = 1, · · · , k. It suﬃces to show
that (si−1 · · · s1hN )−1F ∩ B(r) = ∅, i.e. (si−1 · · · s1hN ) 6∈ F B(r)−1 = F B(r). This is
true since si−1 · · · s1hN 6∈ B(ℓ) and F B(r) ⊂ B(ℓ).

Hence, we deduce that

c(sk, sk−1 · · · s1hN x)c(sk−1, sk−2 · · · s1hN x) · · · c(s1, hN x)
= c(sk, sk−1 · · · s1hN y)c(sk−1, sk−2 · · · s1hN y) · · · c(s1, hN y).

Remark 2.11. (1) The special case G = Zd, d > 1 of Corollary 2.10 is proved
implicitly in the proof of [45, Theorem 3.2], but by a direct calculation using the
structure of Zd.

(2) We could not drop the assumption that G has one end in Corollary 2.10.
Indeed, one can check that the cocycle constructed in Example 5.1 fails this lemma,
and in fact Z 6∈ G, see [28, Introduction] for more discussion on this.

CONTINUOUS COCYCLE SUPERRIGIDITY FOR SHIFTS AND GROUPS WITH ONE END 11

(3) We can slightly relax the assumption in Lemma 2.9. Indeed, the proof still
works if we only assume there exists a ﬁnitely generated, one-ended subgroup G1 < G
such that the non-torsion elements g, h ∈ G1. So the assumption that G has one
end is not used so crucially here as in Lemma 4.3.

3. Specification properties of shifts

Speciﬁcation is a strong orbit tracing property. Ruelle [44] studied the extension
of the notion to Zd -actions. Several deﬁnitions of various speciﬁcation properties
were introduced in [31, Deﬁnition 5.1] (see also [31, Remark 5.6]) to study algebraic
actions of Zd. These have been modiﬁed to the general group case in [9, Section 6].
In this section, we give two more diﬀerent versions of speciﬁcation properties which
play important roles in our work. These are inspired by the speciﬁcation properties
for Zd-subshifts introduced by Schmidt [45].

Deﬁnition 3.1. Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group with a ﬁnite generating set S.
Let a be an element in G. For every r ≥ 0, we deﬁne

∆+(a, r) := {(x, x′) ∈ ∆X : x{ak:k≥0}B(r) = x′
∆−(a, r) := {(x, x′) ∈ ∆X : x{a−k:k≥0}B(r) = x′

{ak:k≥0}B(r)},
{a−k:k≥0}B(r)}.

We say that the equivalence class ∆X (¯x) of a point ¯x ∈ X has strong a-speciﬁcation
(respectively, a-speciﬁcation) if ∆X(¯x) ∩ a−1∆X (¯x)(respectively, ∆X (¯x)) is dense in
X, and if the following property holds: for any r ≥ 0 there exists some ﬁnite integer
N = N(a, r) ≥ r, such that if x, x′ ∈ ∆X (¯x) satisfy that xB(N (a,r)) = x′
B(N (a,r)) then
we can ﬁnd an element y in ∆X (¯x) such that (x, y) ∈ ∆+(a, r) and (x′, y) ∈ ∆−(a, r).
And we say that the homoclinic equivalence relation ∆X has strong a-speciﬁcation
(respectively, a-speciﬁcation) if there exists a point ¯x ∈ X such that ∆X (¯x) has
strong a-speciﬁcation (respectively, a-speciﬁcation).

Remark 3.2. Although we do not put assumption on the element a, in application,
we are mainly interested in a being non-torsion.

The following observation will make sense for the existence of the point y in our

deﬁnition of speciﬁcation.

Lemma 3.3. Let a be an element of G with inﬁnite order, then for every r ≥ 0,
there exists some ﬁnite integer N = N(a, r) ≥ r, such that {ak : k ≥ 0}B(r) ∩
{ak : k ≤ 0}B(r) ⊂ B(N(a, r)).

Proof. If z = akx = a−ℓy, where x, y ∈ B(r) and k, ℓ ≥ 0, then ak+ℓ = yx−1 ∈ B(2r).
Since a is not torsion, limn→∞ ℓS(an) = ∞. Therefore, Sr := {n ≥ 0 : an ∈ B(2r)}
is a ﬁnite set, and we denote the largest element in Sr by M = M(a, r), then we
deduce k ≤ k + ℓ ≤ M since k + ℓ ∈ Sr.

Now, ℓS(z) = ℓS(akx) ≤ ℓS(ak) + r ≤PM

So, {ak : k ≥ 0}B(r) ∩ {ak : k ≤ 0}B(r) ⊂ B(N(a, r)).

i=0 ℓS(ai) + r =: N.

(cid:3)

12

NHAN-PHU CHUNG AND YONGLE JIANG

Lemma 3.4. Let (G, AG) be the full shift. If a ∈ G is not torsion, then ∆X(¯x) has
strong a-speciﬁcation, where ¯x = (0)G, i.e. ¯x is the element in X = AG with every
coordinate to be a constant 0 ∈ A.

Proof. For any z ∈ AG and any ﬁnite set F ⊂ G, if we deﬁne y ∈ AG by setting yg =
zg if g ∈ F and yg = ¯xg if g 6∈ F , then since ¯x is G-invariant, y ∈ ∆X (¯x) ∩ a−1∆X (¯x).
Hence ∆X (¯x) ∩ a−1∆X (¯x) is dense in X.

Now, suppose x, x′ ∈ ∆X (¯x) and they satisfy that xB(N (a,r)) = x′

B(N (a,r)), then
we can deﬁne y ∈ ∆X (¯x) by setting yg = xg if g ∈ {ak : k ≥ 0}B(r), yg = x′
g if
g ∈ {ak : k ≤ 0}B(r) and yg = ¯xg elsewhere. Note that Lemma 3.3 guarantees this
y is well-deﬁned.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.5. Let X ⊂ AG be a subshift and f : X → H be a continuous map,
where H is a discrete group. Assume that ∆X(¯x) has g-speciﬁcation and the cocycles
c(g),±
(x, x′), eH) = 0,

: ∆X → H in (*) and (**) are equal. Then lim (x,x′)→∆

where ∆ ⊂ X × X denotes the diagonal.

Proof. Since H is discrete and f is continuous, there exists a non-empty ﬁnite subset
F of G such that f (y) = f (z) for every y, z ∈ X with yF = zF . Choose r0 ∈ N
such that F ⊂ B(r0). Then for every r ≥ r0, k ≥ 0, (x, x′) ∈ ∆+(g, r), one has
gkF = (g−kx′)F and hence f (g−kx) = f (g−kx′). Then since d is
(g−kx)F = xgkF = x′
bi-invariant, for every r ≥ r0, (x, x′) ∈ ∆+(g, r), one has

d(c(g),−

such that for all x, x′ ∈ ∆X(¯x) with xB(N (g,r)) = x′
B(N (g,r)) there exists an element
y ∈ ∆X (¯x) with (x, y) ∈ ∆+(g, r) and (x′, y) ∈ ∆−(g, r). As before, whenever r ≥ r0
we know that f (gkx′) = f (gky) for every k ≥ 0 and then

4. One end is sufficient

In this section, we will prove Theorem 1.1. To prove it we will prepare several

lemmas.

Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group with S being a ﬁnite symmetric generating
set and g ∈ G be an element with inﬁnite order. Let X ⊂ AG be a subshift for some
ﬁnite set A and H be a discrete group with discrete metric d. Let f : X → H be a
continuous function.

Lemma 4.1. Assume that there exists a point ¯x ∈ X such that ∆X (¯x) ∩ g−1∆X (¯x)
(x, x′), eH) = 0, then there is a continuous

x,x′∈∆X (¯x)

d(c(g),+

f

map b : X → H such that the map x 7→ b(gx)−1f (x)b(x) is constant on X.

Proof. Since lim (x,x′)→∆

d(c(g),+

f

(x, x′), eH) = 0, c(g),+

f

is a cocycle and ∆X (¯x) is

dense in X, one can deﬁne a function ˆc : X×∆X (¯x) → H by ˆc(x, y) := limn→∞ c(g),+
for some (and every) sequence {xn} ⊂ ∆X (¯x) with xn → x. Then we deﬁne the
map b : X → G by b(x) := ˆc(x, ¯x) for every x ∈ X.

f

(xn, y),

f

(z, w), eH) < ǫ

We claim the function b is continuous.
Given ǫ > 0 and x ∈ X, ﬁrst take δ > 0 such that if d(z, w) < δ and z, w ∈ ∆X (¯x),
3, this is possible by the assumption. Now, for any y ∈ X
2, and any ﬁxed xn → x, yn → y with xn, yn ∈ ∆X (¯x) for all n ≥ 1, we

then d(c(g),+

the choice of δ, now we get

(xn, yn), eH) < ǫ

f

d(b(x), b(y)) ≤ d(b(x), b(xn)) + d(b(xn), b(yn)) + d(b(yn), b(y)) < ǫ.
One also has b(x)b(x′)−1 = ˆc(x, ¯x)ˆc(x′, ¯x)−1 = c(g),+

ˆc(x, x′) := limxn→x,yn→x′,xn,yn∈∆X (¯x) c(g),+
(xn, yn). Now we check it is well-deﬁned.

for all i = 1, · · · , k, where k is any positive integer (maybe inﬁnity), then there is a
continuous map b : X → H such that the map x 7→ b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x) is constant
on X (depending only on g) for all g ∈ hg1, · · · , gki, where c : G × X → H is a
continuous cocycle and H is discrete.

Proof. From the proof of Lemma 4.1, we know that for i = 1, · · · , k, the continuous
map bi : X → H deﬁned by bi(x) := limn→∞ c(gi),+
(xn, ¯x) where xn ∈ ∆X (¯x) and
xn → x will make the map x 7→ bi(gix)−1c(gi, x)bi(x) constant (only depending on
gi). Now we claim that bi(x) = bj(x) for all x ∈ X and all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k.

and b(ghx)−1c(gh, x)b(x) = [b(ghx)−1c(g, hx)b(hx)][b(hx)−1c(h, x)b(x)], it is clear

g ∈ hg1, · · · , gki.

Lemma 4.4. Let G be an inﬁnite group that is not torsion and G∞ be the subgroup
generated by all non-torsion elements in G, then G∞ is an inﬁnite normal subgroup
of G.

Proof. This is obvious since order(ghg−1) = order(h).

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We apply successively Corollary 2.10, Lemma 3.5, Lemma
4.1, Lemma 4.3 to conclude that the map x 7→ b(gx)−1c(g, x)b(x) is constant on X
(depending only on g) for all g ∈ G∞, where G∞ is the subgroup of G generated by
all non-torsion elements. Since G∞ is normal in G by Lemma 4.4, then we apply
Lemma 2.5 to conclude that c is a trivial cocycle on the whole group G.
(cid:3)

4.1. Examples. In this subsection, we provide more examples that are continuous
superrigid actions besides full shifts.

Given a dynamical system (G, X), a point x ∈ X is called periodic if its orbit
{gx : g ∈ G} is ﬁnite. For x ∈ X, we denote by stab(x) := {g ∈ G : gx = x}, the
stabilizer of x. It is clear that stab(x) is a subgroup of G for every x ∈ X, and x is
a periodic point if and only if [G : stab(x)] < ∞. Let H be a subgroup with ﬁnite
index, we deﬁne XH := {x ∈ X : hx = x, for all h ∈ H}, the H-periodic points.

Then the set of periodic points P er(X) will be SH<G,[G:H]<∞ XH.

A subshift X of AG is of ﬁnite type if there is a ﬁnite set F of G and a subset P

of AF such that

X = {x ∈ AG : (gx)F ∈ P, ∀g ∈ G}.

The subset F and P is called a deﬁning window and a set of allowed words for X.
It is clear that if a shift of ﬁnite type is deﬁned by a deﬁning window F and a set of
allowed words P ⊂ AF , then for every F ′ ⊃ F , it is also a shift of ﬁnite type deﬁned
by F ′ and P ′ := {x ∈ AF ′

: xF ∈ P }.

The following lemma is an extension of [45, Lemma 2.5] from Zd-actions to actions
of more general groups. The proof of the ﬁrst part here is inspired by the proof of
[7, Theorem 1.1].

Lemma 4.5. Let X ⊂ AG be a subshift of ﬁnite type. Suppose that there exists a
periodic point ¯x such that ∆X(¯x) is dense in X.

(1) If G is a residually ﬁnite group, then Per(X) is dense in X.
(2) If G is a countably inﬁnite group, then (G, X) is topological mixing of every

order.

Proof. Let D be a ﬁnite subset of G such that eG ∈ D, D is a deﬁning window and
P is a set of allowed words P ⊂ AD for X.

(1) Let x ∈ X and Ω be a ﬁnite subset of G. It suﬃces to show that there exists
a periodic point y in X such that xΩ = yΩ. Since ∆X(¯x) is dense in X, there exists
z ∈ ∆X(¯x) such that zΩ = xΩ. Let F be a ﬁnite subset of G such that zG\F = ¯xG\F .
Put F1 = F D−1 and F2 = (F1 ∪ Ω)D−1D. Since G is residually ﬁnite, we can
ﬁnd a normal subgroup H of G with ﬁnite index such that g1H ∩ g2H = ∅ for
every g1 6= g2 ∈ F2. As stab(¯x) is a subgroup of ﬁnite index in G, applying Lemma
[6, Lemma 2.1.10], there exists a normal subgroup K of ﬁnite index in G such that
stab(¯x) ⊃ K. Then L := H ∩ K is a normal subgroup of ﬁnite index in G. Let y be
an element in AG deﬁned by

yg =(cid:26)zg1

¯xg

if gL = g1L for some g1 ∈ F2
otherwise

Since g1H ∩ g2H = ∅ for every g1 6= g2 ∈ F2, one has g1L ∩ g2L = ∅ for every
g1 6= g2 ∈ F2, and hence y is well deﬁned. We will prove that y is a periodic point
we are looking for. First, one has yΩ = zΩ = xΩ since Ω ⊂ F2, and y is a periodic
point because y is constant on every right coset of L. Now we only need to prove
y ∈ X. It suﬃces to show that for every g ∈ G, there exists u(g) ∈ X such that
ygD = u(g)
gD.

Now we consider the ﬁrst case, if for every g1 ∈ F1 and g2 ∈ gD, g1L 6= g2L then
we will show that yg2 = ¯xg2, for every g2 ∈ gD. If g2L 6= hL, for every h ∈ F2, then
by the deﬁnition of y, it is done. If there exists k ∈ F2 \ F1 such that g2L = kL then
yg2 = zk = ¯xk = ¯xg2 since zG\F = ¯xG\F , F ⊂ F1, and ¯x is an L-periodic point.

Suppose now there exist g1 ∈ F1 and g2 = gδ ∈ gD such that g1L = g2L. Since
L is normal, one has Lg1 = Lg2. Then there exists h ∈ L such that h−1gδ = g1.
We will show that hz is the point we are looking for. For all l = gδ′ ∈ gD, one
has h−1l = h−1gδδ−1δ′ = g1δ−1δ′ ∈ F1D−1D ⊂ F2, and hence yl = (hy)l = yh−1l =
zh−1l = (hz)l.

i=1 Hzi for ﬁnitely many zi ∈ G with

H ⊂ stab(¯x), then we decompose G as Fn

z1 = eG.

we denote it by F1.

A dynamical system (G, X) is called surjunctive if every continuous G-commuting

map ϕ : X → X being injective is automatically surjective.

Corollary 4.6. Let G be a countably residually ﬁnite group and let G acts on a
compact metrizable space X by homeomorphisms. Assume that the system (G, X)
is expansive and there exists an extension (G, Y ) of (G, X) such that Y ⊂ AG is a

18

NHAN-PHU CHUNG AND YONGLE JIANG

subshift of ﬁnite type for some ﬁnite set A and Y contains a periodic point ¯y such
that ∆X (¯y) is dense in Y . Then the system (G, X) is surjunctive.

Proof. Let ϕ : Y → X be an extension map. Then ϕ(P er(Y )) ⊂ P er(X) because
ϕ is G-equivariant. From Lemma 4.5, we know that P er(Y ) is dense in Y. And as
ϕ is continuous and surjective, one has P er(X) is dense in X and hence applying
[8, Proposition 5.1], one has (G, X) is surjunctive.
(cid:3)

Deﬁnition 4.7. Let Ω be a non-empty ﬁnite subset of G. A subshift X ⊂ AG is
said to have Ω-propagation if for every non-empty ﬁnite subset F of G and x ∈ AF
satisfying xF ∩gΩ ∈ XF ∩gΩ for every g ∈ G then one has x ∈ XF . And X is said to
have bounded propagation if X has Ω-propagation for some non-empty ﬁnite subset
Ω of G.

The deﬁnition of bounded propagation for subshifts was introduced by Gromov

[20, page 160] and was studied extensively in [7, 13].

Example 4.8. (The generalized golden mean subshifts) Let A = {0, 1, · · · , k}
and F1, · · · , Fm be non-empty ﬁnite subsets of G. Let X(F1, · · · , Fm) be a subset of
AG consisting of all x ∈ AG such that for every 1 ≤ j ≤ m, g ∈ G, there exists
gj ∈ gFj such that xgj = 0. Then it is a bounded propagation subshift of AG
[7, Example 2.8].

Lemma 4.9. Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group with a ﬁnite generating set S and
a be an element in G with inﬁnite order. Let A = {0, 1, · · · , k} and F1, · · · , Fm
be non-empty ﬁnite subsets of G. We denote by X the generalized golden mean
subshifts with respect to F1, · · · , Fm. Then ∆X has strong a-speciﬁcation.

Proof. For every r ≥ 0, we put P +(a, r) := {ak : k ≥ 0}B(r) and P −(a, r) :=
{a−k : k ≥ 0}B(r). Let ¯x be the constant 0 conﬁguration of X then it is clear that
∆X (¯x) ∩ a−1∆X(¯x) is dense in X. Choose r0 ∈ N such that Fj ⊂ B(r0) for every
1 ≤ j ≤ m. Let r > 0. By Lemma 3.3, there exists M ≥ r such that

P +(a, r + r0) ∩ P −(a, r + r0) ⊂ B(M).

Write N = M + r0, we will prove that for every x, x′ ∈ ∆X(¯x) such that xB(N ) =
x′
B(N ), there exists y ∈ ∆X (¯x) such that (x, y) ∈ ∆+(a, r) and (x′, y) ∈ ∆−(a, r).
Let x, x′ ∈ ∆X (¯x) such that xB(N ) = x′

B(N ), we deﬁne y : G → A by

yg =


xg
x′
g
0

if g ∈ P +(a, r)
if g ∈ P −(a, r)
otherwise

Then y has non-zero values at only ﬁnitely many places. Let g ∈ G, 1 ≤ j ≤ m. It
suﬃces to show that there exists gj ∈ gFj such that ygj = 0. If gFj ∩ (P +(a, r) ∪
P −(a, r)) = ∅, i.e. gFj ⊂ G\(P +(a, r)∪P −(a, r)) then ygFj = {0}. Now we consider
the case gFj ∩ (P +(a, r) ∪ P −(a, r)) 6= ∅. If gFj ⊂ P +(a, r) or gFj ⊂ P −(a, r) then
ygFj = xgFj or ygFj = x′
If there exist

gFj respectively, and hence we are done.

CONTINUOUS COCYCLE SUPERRIGIDITY FOR SHIFTS AND GROUPS WITH ONE END 19

f1, f2 ∈ Fj such that gf1 ∈ P +(a, r) and gf2 ∈ P −(a, r), then by assumption on the
element a, one has

g ∈ P +(a, r)f −1

1 ∩ P −(a, r)f −1

2 ⊂ P +(a, r + r0) ∩ P −(a, r + r0) ⊂ B(M).

And hence gFj ⊂ B(M + r0) = B(N). As xB(N ) = x′
of y, ygj = 0 for some gj ∈ gFj.

B(N ), and from the deﬁnition
(cid:3)

Corollary 4.10. Let A = {0, 1, · · · , k}, G be a ﬁnitely generated group satisfying
the conditions as in Theorem 1.1, and F1, · · · , Fm be non-empty ﬁnite subsets of
G. Let X ⊂ AG be the generalized golden mean subshift with respect to F1, · · · , Fm.
Then (G, X) is superrigid.

Proof. Let ¯x be the constant 0 conﬁguration of X then ¯x is a periodic point. Apply-
ing [7, Proposition 2.9], we know that X is a subshift of ﬁnite type. Then combining
Lemmas 4.5, 4.9, and Theorem 1.1, we ﬁnish the proof.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.11. Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group and S = {s1, · · · , sm} be a gener-
ating set of G. Let Fj = {eG, sj} and X(S) ⊂ {0, 1, · · · , k}G the generalized golden
mean subshift with respect to F1, · · · , Fm. Then X(S) consists of all conﬁgurations
in which the i’s are isolated for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k, i.e. X(S) consists of all elements
x ∈ {0, 1, · · · , k}G such that for every g ∈ G, xgsj = 0 whenever xg 6= 0.

5. One end is necessary

In this section, we prove that if G ∈ G, then G has one end. Let us ﬁrst observe
that the free groups Fr(r ≥ 1) do not belong to G. The result should be well-known,
but we can not ﬁnd it in literature. Thus, we present a proof here.

Example 5.1. Let G = F1 = Z, we consider the continuous cocycle c : Z × ( Z
2Z )Z →
Z
2Z deﬁned by setting c(g, x) = xg, where g is the generator of Z. Observe that we
have two x (i.e. the one which is constant 1 and the one which is constant 0) such
2Z and a group homomorphism φ : Z → Z
that gx = x. If there exist b : ( Z
2Z
such that c(g, x) = −b(gx) + φ(g) + b(x) for all x ∈ ( Z
2Z)Z, then we apply this equality
to such two x, we get φ(g) = 0 and φ(g) = 1, a contradiction.

2Z)Z → Z

Similar construction also applies to G = Fr, the free groups on r generators, say
s1, · · · , sr. Indeed, we may consider the cocycle c : Fr × ( Z
2Z deﬁned by
setting c(si, x) = xsi for all x ∈ ( Z
2Z )Fr and all 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Note that this cocycle is
well-deﬁned since there are no relations among these generators. It is not hard to
conclude that this cocycle is not trivial by a similar argument as above.

2Z )Fr → Z

2Z)Z2 → Z

Note that the above construction does not apply to G = Z2, because if we deﬁne
c : Z2 × ( Z
2Z by setting c(a, x) = xa, c(b, x) = xb, where Z2 = ha, bi, then
ab = ba implies c(a, bx) + c(b, x) = c(ab, x) = c(ba, x) = c(b, ax) + c(a, x) for all x.
So xb−1a + xb = xa−1b + xa, but not every x in ( Z
satisfy this relation, so this c
is not well-deﬁned on the whole space.

2Z )Z2

Here, we treat X as a dual group, i.e. (X, +) = \⊕GC2, and we treat Z

2Z = {±1} ⊂
T as a group under multiplication. If x = (xg), y = (yg) ∈ X and a = ⊕g∈F ¯1 ∈ ⊕GC2

for some ﬁnite set F ⊂ G, then x(a) := Qg∈F xg if F 6= ∅, and x(a) := 1 if F = ∅.

x + y ∈ X is deﬁned by (x + y)g := xgyg for all g ∈ G.

It is clear that c′ is continuous. We claim that c′ is not trivial as a {±1} ∼= Z
2Z -

valued cocycle.

20

NHAN-PHU CHUNG AND YONGLE JIANG

Now let us prove if G ∈ G, then G has one end. This might be compared with

[39, Corollary 4.2].

Proof of Theorem 1.2. From Specker’s characterization for ends of groups via the
associated ﬁrst cohomology groups [47] (see its proofs in [10, Theorem 1] or [22,
Theorem 4.6]), we know that if G has more than one end, then H 1(G, ⊕GC2) is
nontrivial, i.e. there exists a 1-cocycle c : G → ⊕GC2 which is not a 1-coboundary,
where C2 = {¯0, ¯1} denotes the cyclic group with two elements under addition. Now,
using such c, we could deﬁne a 1-cocycle c′ : G × ( Z
2Z )G → {±1} ⊂ T by setting
c′(g, x) = x(c(g−1)) for all g ∈ G, x ∈ X = ( Z

2Z)G.

Assume not, then there exist a group homomorphism ρ : G → Z

2Z and a continuous
map b : X → Z
2Z such that c′(g, x) = b(gx)−1ρ(g)b(x) for all g ∈ G and all x ∈ X.
Now, we apply the above equation to x′ = (1)G ∈ X, where 1 ∈ Z
2Z = {±1}, and
note that gx′ = x′ for all g ∈ G, then we deduce ρ(g) = 1 for all g ∈ G; hence,
x(c(g−1)) = c′(g, x) = b(gx)−1b(x) for all g ∈ G and all x ∈ X. This implies c is a
1-coboundary, the proof is the same as the proof of [24, Theorem 1.1], we include it
for completeness.

Since X is a dual group, we have x(c(g−1))y(c(g−1)) = (x + y)(c(g−1)) for all
x, y ∈ X, then b(gx)−1b(x)b(gy)−1b(y) = b(gx + gy)−1b(x + y) for all g ∈ G and all
x, y ∈ X, equivalently, b(x)b(y)b(x + y)−1 = b(gx)b(gy)b(gx + gy)−1 for all g ∈ G
and all x ∈ X.

Now, using the fact that G y (X × X, µ × µ) is ergodic, where µ is the Haar
measure on X, the above implies b(x)b(y)b(x + y)−1 = λ for some constant λ ∈ T
and µ × µ-a.e. (x, y) ∈ X × X.

Then after replacing b with λ−1b, which does not change the original equation on

c′ and b, and applying [24, Lemma 2.7], we may assume b ∈ bX = ⊕GC2. Then we

deduce x(c(g−1)) = x(−g−1b + b) for all x ∈ X, hence c(g) = b − gb for all g ∈ G by
Pontryagin duality, i.e. c : G → ⊕GC2 is a 1-coboundary, which is a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.2. We observe that for continuous cocycles, [24, Theorem 1.1] still holds.
In particular, it implies that if the shift (G, TG) is continuous T-cocycle rigid, then
G has one end. Indeed, if G has more than one end, H 1(G, ZG) = H 1(G, ⊕GZ)
is nontrivial, the same proof as above stills works here after replacing the target
group with T. In fact, the proof of Theorem 1.2 is obtained as we try to apply this
observation. But since in Theorem 1.2, the target group is discrete and the base
space is a ﬁnite set instead of T, we need to take advantage of [22, Theorem 4.6].

CONTINUOUS COCYCLE SUPERRIGIDITY FOR SHIFTS AND GROUPS WITH ONE END 21

Proof of Corollary 1.3. Applying Theorems 1.1, 1.2, and Lemma 3.4, we get the
corollary.
(cid:3)

6. Continuous Orbit Equivalence

In this section we will present an application of Theorem 1.1 to study rigidity of
continuous orbit equivalence. Let G, H be countable groups and X, Y be topological
Hausdorﬀ spaces.

Deﬁnition 6.1. The system (G, X) is free if gx 6= x for every g ∈ G \ {eG}, x ∈ X;
and topologically free if for every eG 6= g ∈ G, one has {x ∈ X : gx 6= x} is dense in
X.

Deﬁnition 6.2. Two topological dynamical systems (G, X) and (H, Y ) are (con-
tinuous) orbit equivalent which we denoted by (G, X) ∼COE (H, Y ) if there exist
continuous maps b : G × X → H, c : H × Y → G and a homeomorphism ϕ : X → Y
with the inverse ψ := ϕ−1 : Y → X such that

(2)

(3)

ϕ(gx) = b(g, x)ϕ(x),

ψ(hy) = c(h, y)ψ(y),

for every x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, g ∈ G, h ∈ H.

Remark 6.3. Note that if the system (G, X) is topologically free then the map c
is uniquely determined by (3) and furthermore, it is a cocycle [30, Remark 1.7 and
Lemma 2.8].

Deﬁnition 6.4. Two topological dynamical systems (G, X) and (H, Y ) are (topologi-
cally) conjugate which we denoted by (G, X) ∼conj (H, Y ) if there exist a group isom-
porphism ρ : G → H and a homeomorphism ϕ : X → Y such that ϕ(gx) = ρ(g)ϕ(x),
for every g ∈ G, x ∈ X.

It is clear that if (G, X) and (H, Y ) are topologically conjugate then they are

orbit equivalent.

Corollary 6.5. Let G be a ﬁnitely generated amenable and torsion-free group. Let
A be a ﬁnite set and σ be the left shift action of G on AG and X ⊂ AG a subshift
such that the induced action of σ on X is topologically free. Assume that the system
(G, X) has properties as in Theorem 1.1. Then if (G, X) is orbit equivalent to
another topologically free system (H, Y ) then they are conjugate. In particular, if
H is a group being non-isomorphic to G then (G, X) is not orbit equivalent to any
topologically free system (H, Y ).

Proof. It follows from Theorem 1.1, Remark 6.3 and [30, Theorem 1.6].
