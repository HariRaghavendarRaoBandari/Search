Introduction

The method of harmonic transplantation as proposed by Hersch in [1] is a technique to construct test
functions for variational problems of the form

J [Ω] = inf
u∈H 1

0 RΩ |∇u|2 dy
RΩ |u|2 dy

,

where Ω is a domain of Rn, n ≥ 3 with smooth boundary. The harmonic transplantation is a gen-
eralization of the conformal transplantation for simply connected planar domain. This method has
numerous applications in mathematical physics and function theory [1, 2, 3]. In particular it has been
used to give estimates from above of the functional J [Ω] , in contrast to the method based on sym-
metrization techniques which gives estimates from below. The harmonic transplantation is connected
to the Green’s function G{Ω;x} of Ω with Dirichlet boundary condition, which is the solution of

The Green’s function can be decomposed as :

(cid:26) ∆G{Ω;x} = −δx

with

and H{Ω;x} is the solution of

Fx(y) = F (ky − xk) =

(cid:26) ∆H{Ω;x} = 0

H{Ω;x}

in Ω

= Fx on ∂Ω,

The functions Fx and H{Ω;x} are called respectively the singular part and the regular part of G{Ω;x}.
The leading term of the regular part of the Green’s function

is called Robin’s function of Ω at x. For n ≥ 3, the harmonic radius r(x) of Ω at x deﬁned in [4] by

t(x) := H{Ω;x}(x)

F (r(x)) = t(x)

2

which gives

1

r(x) = H

2−n

{Ω;x}(x).

The harmonic radius vanishes on the boundary ∂Ω and takes its maximum at the so called harmonic
centers of Ω.
Let Ω be a domain of Rn with smooth boundary, n ≥ 3 and ﬁx x ∈ Ω. If u : B(0, r(x)) → R+ is a
radial function and µ is deﬁned by u(y) = µ(cid:0)G{B(0,r(x));0}(y)(cid:1) , then

deﬁnes the harmonic transplantation of u into Ω.
The harmonic transplantation has the following properties:

U (y) = µ(cid:0)G{Ω;x}(y)(cid:1)

1. It preserves the Dirichlet integral

2. For every positive function ϕ

ZB(0,r(x)) |∇u|2 dy =ZΩ |∇U|2 dy

ZB(0,r(x))

ϕ(u) dy ≤ZΩ

ϕ(U ) dy.

(1.1)

(1.2)

The ﬁrst eigenfunction of the Dirichlet problem on B(0, r(x)) is radial and positive, then as proved by
Hersch in [4], by using Rayleigh’s principle, (1.1) and (1.2), one obtain ∀x ∈ Ω

λ1(Ω) ≤ RΩ |∇U|2 dy

RΩ |U|2 dy ≤ RB(0,r(x)) |∇u|2 dy
RB(0,r(x)) |u|2 dy

= λ1(B(0, r(x))),

hence

Recall that the harmonic transplantation was also extended to spaces of constant curvature by C.
Bandle, A. Brillard, and M. Fluscher, one can see [5].

λ1(Ω) ≤ λ1(B(0, max

Ω

r(y))).

(1.3)

In this work, we will extend the notions of harmonic transplantation and harmonic radius to the
Heisenberg group H1. More precisely, we will deﬁne counter parts of the harmonic transplantation and
the harmonic radius in the subriemannian settings. Our aim is to give an upper bound for the ﬁrst
eigenvalue for the following Dirichlet problem:

(PΩ)(cid:26) −∆H1u = λu in Ω

= 0

u

on ∂Ω,

where Ω is a regular bounded domain of the Heisenberg group H1 with smooth boundary.
The existence of eigenvalues for the Dirichlet problem (PΩ) has been proved by X.Luo and P.Niu in
[10, 11, 12] using the Kohn inequality (one can see [13]) for the vector ﬁelds generating the horizontal
tangent bundle of the Heisenberg group together with the spectral properties of compact operators.
The method, we will use in the present work is based on technics related to the harmonic transplan-
tation method and a result of P.Pansu given in [6, 7] which give the relation between the volume of
Ω and the perimeter of its boundary. But, we know that we won’t lead to a similar formula to (1.3)

3

since Heisenberg balls or Koranyi balls are not isoperimetric regions in the Heisenberg group H1.

The isoperimetric problem as introduced by P.Pansu in [6, 7] consists to ﬁnd subsets I of H1 among all
subsets I ′ with the same Riemannian volume as I associated to the left invariant Riemannian metric
such that

PH1(I) ≤ PH1(I ′)

(1.4)
where PH1(I) denotes the horizontal perimeter of I. The set I is called an isoperimetric region in H1.
The existence of isoperimetric regions was proved by G. P. Leonardi and S. Rigot in [9] for the more
general context of Carnot groups.
For any bounded open set Ω in H1 with C 1 boundary, P.Pansu proved in [6, 7] the existence of a
constant C > 0, so that

3

|Ω|

4 ≤ CPH1(Ω).

(1.5)

and conjectured that any isoperimetric region of H1 bounded by a smooth surface is congruent to a
bubble set:

B(0, R) =(cid:26)(z, t) ∈ H1,|t| < R2arccos(cid:18)|z|

R(cid:19) + |z|pR2 − |z|2, |z| < R(cid:27) .

for some R > 0. Recall that B(0, R) is obtained by rotating around the t-axis the geodesic joining the
two poles − π

2 R2. The boundary of B(0, R) is

2 R2 and π

SR =(cid:26)(z, t) ∈ H1,|t| = R2arccos(cid:18)|z|

R(cid:19) + |z|pR2 − |z|2, |z| < R(cid:27) .

In [8], M.Ritore and C.Rosales proved that an isoperimetric region in the class of Heisenberg group
sub domains with C 2 surfaces as boundaries is congruent to a subset of H1 having SR as boundary. A
similar result was obtained by R. Monti and M. Rickly in [21] for convex euclidian domains H1.
In the present work: we won’t use isoperimetric regions and the isoperimetric inequality in the Heisen-
berg group H1 with the method of harmonic transplantation to determine an upper bound of the ﬁrst
eigenvalue λ1(Ω) of (PΩ) as it was the case for the Euclidian settings. Instead, we will use the result
of P.Pansu [6, 7] given above by (1.5). Our main results are

Theorem 6.2
Let Ω be a bounded domain of H1 with smooth boundary, such that Ω and H1 \ ¯Ω satisfy the uniform
exterior ball property (3.1) and let ξ be any point in Ω, we have

where l11 is the ﬁrst strictly positive zero of the Bessel function J1(l) and rΩ(ξ) is the harmonic radius

(cid:3)

The second theorem is a reﬁned version of the ﬁrst one.

The paper is organized as follows:
in Section 2, we will introduce the general framework, we begin
by recalling the local structure of the Heisenberg group, the Carnot-Carathéodory distance and the
Koranyi balls. The section 3 is devoted to the study of some properties of Green’s functions of the
Kohn- Laplace operator and their level sets. These properties lead to extend the notion of harmonic
radius to the Heisenberg group H1, which is the purpose of section 4. In section 5, we will use the
Green’s functions of Koranyi balls to extend the harmonic transplantation to the Heisenberg group H1.
Finally, in section 6, we prove our main result, Theorem 6.2, then we give a reﬁned version of this result
which is Theorem 6.3. For the proof, we proceed as follows, we perturb the Dirichlet problem (PΩ) on
a Koranyi’s ball, then we compare the Rayleigh ratios of its solutions with those of their corresponding
harmonics transplantations.

2 The Heisenberg group H1

The Heisenberg group H1 is the Lie group whose underlying manifold is C× R = R3, with coordinates
for all η = (x, y, t), ξ = (x0, y0, t0) ∈ R3, ηoξ =
(x, y, t), the group law o is deﬁned as follows:
(x + x0, y + y0, t + t0 + 2(x0y − xy0)). For η ∈ H1, the left translation by ξ is the diﬀeomorphism
Lη(ξ) = ηoξ. The Heisenberg group dilations are the H1− transformations:

δλ(η) = (λx, λy, λ2t), λ > 0.

The homogeneous norm of the space is given for all η ∈ H1 by
1
ρ(η) =(cid:0)(x2 + y2)2 + t2(cid:1)
4 ,

and the natural distance is accordingly deﬁned for all η, ξ ∈ H1 by:

dH1(ξ, η) = ρ(ξ−1oη).

The open balls B(ξ, r) associated to this distance are called the Koranyi balls

B(ξ, r) =(cid:8)η ∈ H1, dH1(ξ, η) < r(cid:9) .

A function u : Ω → R deﬁned on a domain Ω of H1 is called radial or ρ-radial if there exists a function
ϕ : R+ → R such that u(ξ) = ϕ(ρ(ξ)), for all ξ ∈ Ω.

give a base for the tangent space TηH1. Whereas The horizontal distribution H of H1 is generated by
the vector ﬁelds X and Y. The horizontal projection of a vector V on H will be denoted by VH, so
a vector V is called horizontal if V = VH. For any C 1 function ϕ deﬁned in an open set of H1, the
horizontal gradient of ϕ is given by

We denote the Lie bracket of two vectors ﬁelds V1 and V2 deﬁned on H1 by [V1, V2].
We have, the following identities for the base (X, Y, T )

∇H1ϕ = (Xϕ)X + (Y ϕ)Y.

(2.1)

We consider on H1, the left-invariant Riemannian metric gH1 =< ., . > given in [22]

[X, T ] = [Y, T ] = 0 and [X, Y ] = −4T.

for which the triplet (X, Y, T ) is an orthonormal basis for all point in H1. The corresponding Levi
Civita connexion denoted by D satisﬁes

gH1 = dx2 + dy2 + (dt − 2ydx + 2xdy)2

DY Y = 0, DT T = 0

DX X = 0,
DX Y = −2T, DX T = 2Y, DY T = −2X
DT X = 2Y, DT Y = −2X.
DY X = 2T,

(cid:3)

The volume of a domain Ω ⊂ H1 denoted by |Ω|, is the Riemannian volume associated to the the left
invariant Riemannian metric gH1, which coincides with the Lebesgue measure in R3.
For a C 1 surface Σ in H1 with N as unit vector normal to Σ, we deﬁne its area by

A(Σ) =ZΣ |NH1| dΣ,

(2.2)

where NH = N− < N, T > T denotes the orthogonal projection of N onto the horizontal distribution,
and dΣ is the Riemannian area element induced by the metric gH1 on Σ. If Σ is a C 1 surface of a
bounded domain Ω, so A(Σ) coincides with PH1(Ω) the horizontal perimeter of Ω is deﬁned by

PH1(Ω) = sup(cid:26)ZΩ

divV dv; V horizontal of classC 1, |V | ≤ 1(cid:27) ,

(2.3)

where divV is the Riemannian divergence of the vector ﬁeld V , and dv is the element of volume
associated to gH1. For more details one can see [14, 15, 20].

Remark 2.1. In the rest of the paper, for a given domain D ⊂ H1 with boundary ∂D, dΣD will denote
the Riemannian element area on ∂D induced by the Riemannian metric gH1.

We denotes by ∆H1 the Kohn-Laplace operator on the Heisenberg group, which is deﬁned by

The Kohn-Laplace operator ∆H1 satisﬁes the Hörmander conditions, thus it is hypoelliptic on H1.
Particularly, any harmonic function u deﬁned on an open set Ω of H1 (∆H1u = 0, in Ω) is C ∞.

∆H1 = X 2 + Y 2.

0 (Ω) is a Hilbert space with the inner product < u, v >S1,2

This inequality ensures in particular that for every domain Ω of H1, |ϕ| = |∇H1ϕ|2 is a norm on C∞
0 (Ω).
We shall denote by S1,2(Ω) the Banach space of the functions u ∈ L2(Ω) such that the distributional
derivative X1u, X2u ∈ L2(Ω), and by S1,2
0 (Ω) with respect to the norm above.
The space S1,2

In what follows, we let 0 < λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ ... ≤ λm ≤ ... −→ +∞ denote the successive eigenvalues for
(PΩ) with corresponding eigenfunctions: u1, u2, ..., um, ... in S1,2(Ω).
The Kohn-Laplace operator is related to the following result called the maximum principle

3 Green’s function

Before giving the diﬀerent properties of the Green’s function, we will introduce the notion of uniform
exterior ball property.
Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that the domain Ω of H1 satisﬁes the uniform exterior ball property, if the
following condition holds

T here exists r0 > 0 such that
∀ ξ ∈ ∂ Ω, ∀ r ∈ ]0, r0] ∃ η ∈ Hn such that
Bd(η, r) ∩ Ω = ∅ and ξ ∈ ∂Bd(η, r).




(3.1)

(cid:3)

We consider an open set Ω of the Heisenberg group H1 with smooth boundary, such that Ω and Hn \ Ω
satisfy the uniform exterior ball property. This condition seems to be natural since the Koranyi balls
of H1 satisfy such a property. In [24], Hansen and Hueber proved that this condition implies that the
domain Ω is then regular: for ϕ in C(∂Ω), the Dirichlet problem

(cid:26) ∆H1u = 0

u

in Ω

= ϕ on ∂Ω.

has a classical solution u ∈ C 2(Ω) ∩ C(Ω). In particular, Ω has a Green’s function for every ξ ∈ Ω,
which we denote by G{Ω;ξ}. More precisely, for every ξ ∈ Ω, there exists a classical solution H{Ω;ξ} of
the Dirichlet problem

(cid:26) ∆H1H{Ω;ξ} = 0

H{Ω;ξ}

= Γξ

in Ω
on ∂Ω,

(3.2)

where Γξ is a fundamental solution of −∆H1 with pole at ξ. Hence, the Green’s function is deﬁned by
(3.3)

G{Ω;ξ}(η) = Γξ(η) − H{Ω;ξ}(η)

with

Γξ(η) =

1

8πρ2(ξ−1oη)

.

(3.4)

The functions Γξ and H{Ω;ξ} are called respectively the singular part and the regular part of the Green’s
function G{Ω;ξ}.

(cid:3)

3.1 Examples

Finding Green’s functions for given domains is diﬃcult, however for certain domains with nice geome-
tries, it is possible. We will give two examples below.

Example 3.2. The Green’s function of the Koranyi ball B(ξ, R) with pole at ξ is given by

indeed, we have

G{B(ξ,R);ξ}(η) =

ξ = (0, 0, t0), recall that the boundary of D is ∂D = ∂{η(x, y, t) ∈ H1, t = 0}. We have

(cid:3)

3.2 Properties of the Green’s function

Let Ω be a regular domain of H1 and Gξ the Green’s function associated to Ω with pole at the point ξ.

Property 3.4. The function Gξ is positive on Ω.

Proof. We have lim
η→ξ

Gξ(η) = +∞, so ∀M > 0, there exists r > 0 such that

Gξ(η) > M > 0, ∀η ∈ B(ξ, r)

(3.5)

.
Let D = Ω\B(ξ, r), the function Gξ is harmonic on D. As Gξ vanishes on ∂Ω and is strictly positive
on ∂B(ξ, r), thus by using the maximum principle given in Theorem 2.2, we obtain

Gξ ≥ 0 on D.
Through (3.5) and (3.6), we conclude that Gξ ≥ 0 on Ω.

(3.6)

Property 3.5. The Green’s function is symmetric, it is a consequence of the fact that the Kohn-Laplace
operator is a self adjoint operator.

Property 3.6. If Ω1 ⊂ Ω2, we have for all ξ ∈ Ω1

G{Ω1;ξ} ≤ G{Ω2;ξ} on Ω1

Proof. We consider for ξ ∈ Ω1, the function deﬁned on Ω1

so

ψξ = G{Ω2,ξ} − G{Ω1,ξ}.

ψξ = H{Ω1,ξ} − H{Ω2,ξ},

9

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

thus, ψξ is harmonic on Ω1. On the other hand, as G{Ω2,ξ} is positive on Ω2, then ∀η ∈ ∂Ω1,

by using the maximum principle, we have ∀η ∈ Ω1

ψξ = G{Ω2,ξ} ≥ 0,

Therefore

ψξ ≥ 0.

G{Ω2,ξ} ≥ G{Ω1,ξ}.

(3.7)

For any real c, we denote by Ω(c) = {η ∈ Ω, Gξ(η) > c}, the level set of the Green’s function on Ω
and by ∂Ω(c) = {η ∈ Ω, Gξ(η) = c} its boundary.
Theorem 3.7. Let Gξ be the Green’s function of Ω with pole at ξ. For almost every τ, it holds

Z∂Ω(τ )

|∇H1Gξ|2
|∇Gξ|

dΣΩ(τ ) = 1.

(cid:3)

Proof. Let D = Ω(τ )\B(ξ, ǫ). So Gξ = Γξ − Hξ is harmonic on D and we have

An integration by parts gives

∆H1Gξdv = 0.

ZD

ZD

∆H1Gξdv = Z∂Ω(τ ) h∇H1Gξ, N1i dΣΩ(τ ) −Z∂B(ξ,ǫ) h∇H1Gξ, N2i dΣB(ξ,ǫ)

= 0,

where

and

Thus

On one hand

N1 = − ∇Gξ
|∇Gξ|

N2 = − ∇ρ(ξ−1oη)
|∇ρ(ξ−1oη)|

.

Z∂Ω(τ ) h∇H1Gξ, N1i dΣΩ(τ ) =Z∂B(ξ,ǫ) h∇H1Gξ, N2i dΣB(ξ,ǫ).

Z∂B(ξ,ǫ) h∇H1Gξ, N2i dΣB(ξ,ǫ) =Z∂B(ξ,ǫ) h∇H1Γξ, N2i dΣB(ξ,ǫ) −Z∂B(ξ,ǫ) h∇H1Hξ, N2i dΣB(ξ,ǫ),

then, by proceeding with an integration by parts in the second integral of the equality above, we obtain

10

Z∂B(ξ,ǫ) h∇H1Hξ, N2i dΣB(ξ,ǫ) =ZB(ξ,ǫ)

∆H1Hξdv = 0.

Z∂B(ξ,ǫ) h∇H1Γξ, N2i dΣB(ξ,ǫ) = −1,

Z∂Ω(τ ) h∇H1Gξ, N1i dΣΩ(τ ) = −1.

On the other hand

therefore

The result follows.

4 The harmonic radius in the Heisenberg group

4.1 Deﬁnition and examples
The harmonic radius of a regular domain Ω ⊂ H1 at a ﬁxed point ξ, denoted by rΩ(ξ) is deﬁned by

where

Γ(rΩ(ξ)) = H{Ω;ξ}(ξ)

Γ(r) =

1

8πr2

and H{Ω;ξ} is the regular part of the Green’s function G{Ω;ξ}.
Using the expression of the function Γ, we obtain

rΩ(ξ) =

1

q8πH{Ω;ξ}(ξ)

(cid:3)

Remark 4.1. As H{Ω;ξ} is strictly positive, the harmonic radius is well deﬁned.

The diﬃculty to explicit the harmonic radius at all points of any domain Ω is due to the diﬃculty to
explicit Green’s functions for such domain as we noticed it earlier. So as examples, we will come back
to the ones given in the last section.

Example 4.2. Let Ω be the Koranyi’s ball B(ξ, R). The associated Green’s function with pole at the
center ξ of the ball, is

G{Ω;ξ}(η) =

1

8πρ2(ξ−1oη) −

1

4.2 Properties of The harmonic radius

In the sequel and for the sake of simplicity, the functions G{Ω;ξ} and H{Ω;ξ} will be respectively denoted
by Gξ and Hξ.
Property 4.4. For any regular domain Ω of H1 and any ξ ∈ Ω, we have

inf
η∈∂Ω

ρ(ξ−1oη) ≤ rΩ(ξ) ≤ sup

η∈∂Ω

ρ(ξ−1oη)

(4.1)

(cid:3)

Proof. . Since Hξ is harmonic on Ω, so by using the maximum principle for the Kohn-Laplace operator,
we obtain

thus, by using (4.2), (4.3) and (4.4), we obtain

8πρ2(ξ−1oη) ≤ Hξ(η) ≤ sup
The result follows using the deﬁnition of the harmonic radius.

Property 4.5. The harmonic radius is monotone, it means that, if Ω1 ⊂ Ω2, then for all ξ in Ω1

Proof. We consider the function

we have

As ψξ is positive, we obtain

The result follows.

rΩ1(ξ) ≤ rΩ2(ξ)

ψξ = G{Ω2,ξ} − G{Ω1,ξ}

ψξ = H{Ω1,ξ} − H{Ω2,ξ}.

H{Ω1,ξ}(ξ) ≥ H{Ω2,ξ}(ξ).

(cid:3)

Property 4.6. Boundary Behavior
Since the regular part of the Green’s function coincides with its singular part on the boundary of the
domain, the harmonic radius vanishes at every point of the boundary. More precisely, Let ξ, η ∈ ∂Ω,
then

lim
η→ξ

Hξ(η) = lim
η→ξ

Γξ(η) = ∞.

Hence rΩ(ξ) = 0.
Furthermore, we have the following expansion of the Harmonic radius near the boundary of domains
Ω such that Ω and H1 \ Ω satisfy (3.1). For a point ξ ∈ Ω, let us denote dξ = d(ξ, ∂(Ω)) its distance
from the boundary of Ω, then

Hξ(ξ) =

1

(2dξ)2 + o(d−2
ξ )

For a proof one can see [16]. Hence, the harmonic radius has the following expansion near the boundary

rΩ(ξ) = 2dξ + o(dξ)

(cid:3)

In the following, we will give the relation between the harmonic radius of Ω and those of its level sets.

Proposition 4.7. Let Ω(τ ) = {η ∈ Ω, Gξ(η) > τ} with τ a positive real and ξ ∈ Ω(τ ). We have the
following relation between the harmonic radius of Ω(τ ) at ξ denoted by rΩ(τ )(ξ) and the one of Ω at
the same point

rΩ(τ )(ξ) =

rΩ(ξ)

Proof. We deﬁne on Ω(τ ), the function

ξ (η) = Gξ − τ =
ξ vanishes on ∂Ω(τ ) and the function H τ

As Gτ
the Green’s function associated to the set Ω(τ ) and H τ
radius of Ω(τ ) at ξ, is given by

1

8πρ2(ξ−1oη) − Hξ(η) − τ.

ξ = Hξ + τ is harmonic on Ω(τ ), we conclude that Gτ

Next, we will give the relation between the harmonic radius of Ω at a given point ξ ∈ Ω and the volume
of Ω.
Theorem 4.8. Let Ω be a domain of H1 such that Ω and H1 \ ¯Ω satisfy the uniform exterior property
(3.1)and let ξ be a point of Ω. We have the following inequality

with

rΩ(ξ) ≤ αΩ(ξ) (

αΩ(ξ) =

(4.9)

(cid:3)

Proof. The result is a direct consequence of (2.4) and (4.7).

Example 4.10. We come back to Example 4.2, where, we showed that the harmonic radius of the
Koranyi’s ball B(ξ, r) at ξ is equal to the radius r. Since

sup

η∈∂B(ξ,r)

dH1(ξ, η) = inf

η∈∂B(ξ,r)

dH1(ξ, η) = r,

we derive that

Then, using (2.4), we obtain the equality case in (4.7) and (4.9).

αB(ξ,r)(ξ) = 1.

Proposition 4.11. For almost every positive real τ, we have

αΩ(τ )(ξ) ≤ αΩ(ξ),

Proof. The Green’s function of Ω(τ ) is given by

GΩ(τ ),ξ(η) =

1

8πρ2(ξ−1oη) − Hξ(η) − τ,

1

8πρ2(ξ−1oητ )

= Hξ(ητ ) + τ.

so, for all ητ ∈ ∂Ω(τ )

Next, we use (4.5), to obtain

dH1(ξ, η)!2 + τ ≤

5 Harmonic Transplantation

5.1 A result of P.Pansu in H1

We have the following result
If Ω ⊂ H1 is a C 1 bounded domain, then PH1(Ω), the horizontal perimeter of Ω coincides with the area
of ∂Ω.

where NH = N− < N, T > T denotes the orthogonal projection of N onto the horizontal distribution,
and dΣ is the Riemannian area element induced by the metric gH1 on ∂Ω (one can see [14, 15, 20]).

A(∂Ω) =Z∂Ω |NH1| dΣΩ,

(5.1)

(cid:3)

Recall that PH1(Ω) is deﬁned by

PH1(Ω) = sup(cid:26)ZΩ

divV dv; V horizontal of classeC 1, |V | ≤ 1(cid:27) ,

where divV is the Riemannian divergence of the vector ﬁeld V , and dv is the volume element associated
to the left-invariant Riemannian metric gH1.
As a consequence, one obtain

Deﬁnition 5.3. Let Ω be a bounded regular subset of H1 satisfying (3.1) and ξ a point in Ω. If
u : B(0, rΩ(ξ)) → R+ is a ρ-radial function on the Koranyi’s ball of center 0 and radius rΩ(ξ) and ϕ is
a function deﬁned by ϕ(G{B(0,rΩ(ξ)),0}) = u. Then the harmonic transplantation Uξ of u into Ω is the
function

Uξ = ϕ(Gξ).

Proposition 5.4. Let Ω be a regular bounded domain of H1 and ξ any point in Ω, then

ZΩ |∇H1Uξ|2 dv =ZB(0,rΩ(ξ)) |∇H1u|2 dv.

6 The ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Kohn-Laplace operator

In this section, we will use Proposition 5.5 to ﬁnd an upper bound for the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1 of a
regular bounded domain in the Heisenberg group H1 associated to the following problem:

(PΩ)(cid:26) −∆H1u = λu in Ω

= 0

on ∂Ω

u

(6.1)

called The Kohn-Laplace problem. We recall that ∆H1 = X 2 + Y 2 is the Kohn-Laplace operator in
the Heisenberg group H1, where X =

and Y =

+ 2y

.

∂
∂x

∂
∂t

∂
∂y − 2x

∂
∂t

The existence of the eigenvalues of (PΩ) was proved by X.Luo and P.Niu in [10, 11, 12] by using the
Kohn inequality ([13]) for the two vector ﬁelds X, Y with the spectral properties of compact operators.

The problem (PΩ) does not admit a radial solution in the ball case, which imposes a constraint for
the use of the method of Harmonic transplantation in the order to ﬁnd an upper bound for the ﬁrst
eigenvalue as in the Euclidean case. Indeed, if u is ρ−radial, so there exists a real function f such that
u(η) = f (ρ(η)), thus

∆H1u(η) =

x2 + y2

ρ2(η) (cid:18)f ′′(ρ(η)) +

3

ρ(η)

f ′(ρ(η))(cid:19)

and by using the polar coordinates, we obtain

∆H1u(η) = sin(θ)(cid:18)f ′′(r) +

3
r

f ′(r)(cid:19) .

So, to obtain a radial solution of the Kohn-Laplace problem for the Koranyi’s ball B(0, R), we have to
solve the following problem :

(cid:26) − sin(θ)(cid:0)f ′′(r) + 3

f (R)

r f ′(r)(cid:1) = λf (r) in ]0, R[×]0, Π[

= 0

which obviously does not admit a radial solution.
The idea to ﬁnd an upper bound for the ﬁrst eigenvalue of (PΩ) is to perturb (PB(0,R)) and consider
the following problem

(cid:26) −∆H1u = µ(R)ψu in B(0, R)\{0}

on ∂B(0, R)

= 0

u

(6.2)

where ψ(η) =

x2 + y2
ρ2(η)

= |∇H1ρ|2. We will prove that problem (6.2) admits a radial solution given by

Bessel functions. To this aim, let us consider the function

Jm(l) =(cid:18) l

2(cid:19)m ∞
Xk=0

(−1)k

k!Γ(m + k + 1)(cid:18) l

2(cid:19)2k

which is the Bessel function of ﬁrst kind with order m, it is a solution of the following equation

d2y
dx2 +

1
x

+(cid:18)1 −

m2

x2 (cid:19) y = 0,

called Bessel equation, we refer to [19]. The function Jm(l) admits an inﬁnity of simple and positive
zeros:

20

0 < lm1 < lm2 < ..., Jm(lmj) = 0, j ∈ N ∗

.

The function Gamma Γ is deﬁned on ]0,∞[, by Γ(x) =R +∞
and veriﬁes Γ(n) = (n − 1)!, ∀n ∈ N ∗.
To ﬁnd a radial solution for problem (6.2), ﬁrstly, we have to solve the following problem

exp−t tx−1dt

We consider f (r) =

and performing the change of variables l =pµ(R)r, we obtain

g′(r) + (µ(R) −

g′′(r) +

g′(l) + (1 −

The equation

l2 )g(l) = 0.

admits the Bessel functionJ1(l) as solution. Then J1(√µ r) is a solution of

g′′(r) +

1

g′(r) + (µ(R) −

which implies that

J1(√µ r) is a solution of

f ′′(r) +

3
r

f ′(r) + µ(R)f (r) = 0.

So problem (6.3) admits as eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions respectively

J1(cid:18) l1jr

R (cid:19) , j = 1, 2, ....

where the l1j ’s are the strictly positive zeros of the Bessel function J1(l).
Next, we remark that on B(0, R) \ {0}, we have

Therefore, the radial eigenfunctions and the associated eigenvalues of problem (6.3)

∆H1f1j(ρ(η)) + µ1j(R)ψf1j(ρ(η)) = 0 ∀j = 1, 2, ...

21

u1j(η) = f1j(ρ(η)), µ1j(R) =

1j
R2 , ∀j = 1, 2, ...

are respectively solutions of problem (6.2). Hence, we derive the following result

Corollary 6.1. For j = 1, 2, ..., we have

ZB(0,R) |∇H1u1j|2 dv = µ1j(R)ZB(0,R)

Now, we are ready to state our main result
Theorem 6.2. Let Ω be a bounded domain of H1 with smooth boundary, such that Ω and H1\ ¯Ω satisfy
the uniform exterior ball property (3.1) and let ξ be any point in Ω, we have

λ1(Ω) ≤ CΩ(ξ)

l2

r2
Ω(ξ)

where l11 is the ﬁrst strictly positive zero of the Bessel function J1(l) and rΩ(ξ) is the harmonic radius
of Ω at ξ.

(cid:3)

Proof. Using Rayleigh’s principle, the ﬁrst eigenvalue of problem (PΩ) is given by

CΩ(ξ), where AΩ is the set of harmonic centers of Ω.

If Ω is a convex (Euclidean) domain of H1, then it has only one harmonic center. As an example, we
will give the case of a Koranyi’s ball.
Example 6.4. In the case of the Koranyi’s ball B(ξ, R), of center ξ ∈ H1 and radius R, using the
result of Example 4.10 and Theorem 6.2, we obtain

As a continuation of this work, we can propose these open questions:

1. Compare the ﬁrst eigenvalue of (PΩ), with the ﬁrst eigenvalue of (PΩ′), where Ω′ is an isoperi-

metric region having the same volume as Ω.

2. Compare the ﬁrst eigenvalue of (PΩ′), where Ω′ is an isoperimetric region with the ﬁrst eigenvalue

of (PB(0,R)), B(0, R) is the bubble set with the same volume as Ω′.

3. After completing questions 1. and 2., one can attempt to ﬁnd an analogous formula for the one

given by Hersch in the Euclidian settings by using perhaps diﬀerent methods.
