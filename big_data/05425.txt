In the presence of an external static magnetic ﬁeld, an atomic gas becomes optically active, show-
ing magneto-optical rotation. In the saturated regime, the coherences among the excited substates
give a nonlinear contribution to the rotation of the light polarization. In contrast with the linear
magneto-optical rotation, the nonlinear counterpart is insensitive to Doppler broadening. By vary-
ing the temperature of a cold strontium gas, we observe both regimes by driving the J = 0 → J = 1
transition on the intercombination line. For this narrow transition, the sensitivity to the static mag-
netic ﬁeld is typically three orders of magnitude larger than for a standard broad alkali transition.

INTRODUCTION

Since several decades, magneto-optical eﬀect has been
used for various applications, like sensitive optical mag-
netometry, and the study of fundamental properties in
nature such as parity symmetry violation and wave trans-
port in optically active media. For example, in a random
medium, magneto-optical eﬀect may suppress weak local-
ization of light [1, 2]. It also induces a weak transversal
asymmetry in the radiation pattern of a Mie scatterer,
leading to the appearance of a photonic Hall current [3].
In a periodic arrangement, strong magneto-optical eﬀect
in the microwave domain has been used to create topolog-
ical edge states [4]. All these examples show interesting
similarities between electromagnetic wave transport in
presence of magneto-optical eﬀect and electronic trans-
port in condensed matter systems.

As discovered by M. Faraday in 1845, magneto-optical
eﬀect in a nonabsorbing homogeneous medium leads to a
net rotation of a linear polarization when the propagation
axis is along the external magnetic ﬁeld. This is known
as the Faraday rotation. It naturally arises from circular
birefringence, i.e.
the phase diﬀerence experienced by
the two orthogonal circular polarization components of
the incident linear polarization. The rotation angle of
the linear polarization is given by:

θ = VBLB,

(1)

where B is the external static magnetic ﬁeld, L is the
length of the medium, and VB is the Verdet constant of
the material. For high sensitivity magnetometry, media
with large Verdet constant are required. This criteria
is naturally fulﬁlled by a medium that has sharp reso-
nances, which show strong dispersive behavior. In this
respect, extensive studies have been done on atomic va-

pors (see Ref. [5] for a review). So far, the best perfor-
mances are obtained using electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT). Here, a narrow resonance emerges
from the two-photon coupling of the ground state man-
ifold which dramatically increases the sensitivity [6–8].
Importantly, the two-photon resonance is insensitive to
Doppler frequency shift. This scheme, known as the non-
linear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR), has been opti-
mized over the years using diﬀerent strategies. One strat-
egy is to increase the ground state coherence lifetime us-
ing thermal vapor cells with anti-relaxation walls [9] or
cold gases [10]. Other strategies, including the use of
squeezed light [11], optically dense media [12] and res-
onant cavity enhancement [13], have been also imple-
mented.
In this paper, we report the observation of magneto-
optical eﬀect on the 689 nm 1S0 →3P1 intercombination
line of laser cooled 88Sr atoms. Here, the transition is
typically three orders of magnitude narrower than the
usual alkali atoms. Thus, the sensitivity of the linear
magneto-optical rotation (LMOR) is increased by the
same order of magnitude. However, the ground state is
non-degenerate, so NMOR due to ground state coherence
in EIT scheme is absent. Instead, NMOR occurs because
of the coherence in the excited substates. The interplay
between LMOR and NMOR depends on both the probe
intensity and the temperature of the gas. We show that
NMOR is favored at high probe beam intensity, when
the transition linewidth is dominated by Doppler broad-
ening. We study as well the Voigt or Cotton-Mouton
rotation, when the external magnetic ﬁeld is in the plane
orthogonal to the optical axis. Here, the magneto-optical
rotation angle scales as a square of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Similar to the Faraday rotation, we observe an anoma-
lous curvature close to zero magnetic ﬁeld, which has a
sign that is opposite to its linear counterpart.

The paper is organized as follows. The description
of the experimental setup is given in Section II. In Sec-
tion III, we derive the general expression of the LMOR in
the Faraday and Voigt conﬁgurations. These two conﬁgu-

where u is the propagation distance and ω is the angular

is P = ρTr{ˆσ(u)d}, with ρ being the atomic density,

and V and compared with the experimental results. Fi-
nally, we give our conclusions in Section VI.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The preparation of the laser-cooled 88Sr atoms is de-
scribed in detail in Ref. [14]. After the magneto-optical
trap (MOT) is switched oﬀ, the cold gas is held in a mo-
lasses for 20 ms followed by free expansion for another
20 ms, before the experiment is performed. The atomic
cloud has a typical optical thickness of b¯v(0) = 1.0(5).
The typical temperature of the cloud is 1.2(2) µK. The 4-
σ diameters of the cloud, in a plane perpendicular to the
probe propagation axis, are 2.0(1) mm and 1.0(1) mm.
By adjusting the cooling parameters, the optical thick-
ness can be increased to 2.6 and the cloud temperature
can be increased up to 15 µK.

The external static magnetic ﬁeld, applied during the
experiment,
is controlled using a feedback loop sys-
tem [15]. The system removes the other unwanted mag-
netic ﬁeld components including the 50 Hz contribution.
The magnetic ﬁeld is stabilized below the 1 mG level over
the duration of the experiment.

The schematic diagram of the magneto-optical rota-
tion experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 1(a). The
probe is on the intercombination line resonance. Its po-
larization is at an angle of 45◦ with respect to the s-axis
and the p-axis of a polarizing cube, located after the cold
atomic cloud. We deﬁne the z -axis to be along the ex-
ternal static magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. B = Bˆz. Thus, in the
Faraday conﬁguration, one has ˆx = ˆp and ˆy = ˆs. The
Voigt conﬁguration is deﬁned such that ˆz = ˆp, with the
propagation of the probe laser being along the y-axis.
Each conﬁguration leads to a net magneto-optical rota-
tion of the electric ﬁeld polarization, which is denoted by
θ. The transmission proﬁles in the s and p polarization
components are collected simultaneously on a sensitive
CCD camera [see for example Fig. 1(b)]. We apply a
two dimensional ﬁtting procedure on the images to ex-
tract the transmission at the center of the cold cloud.
The magneto-optical rotation angle, θ, is given by the
formula:

where α is the polarization angle with respect to the p-
axis, and Is and Ip are the transmitted intensities in the
s and p polarization channels at the center of the cold
cloud.

III. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

The atomic gas is modeled by an eﬀective slab with
the same optical thickness as the value along the center
of the cloud. The propagation of a plane wave in the slab

B is an external static magnetic ﬁeld oriented along the
z-axis. µz is the z-component of the magnetic moment
operator of the atom.
We consider solutions of Eqs. (3)–(6) for a J = 0 →
J = 1 transition, corresponding to the 1S0 →3P1 inter-
combination line of 88Sr [see Fig. 1(c)]. For a general
laser intensity I and optical thickness b¯v of the cold gas,
Eqs. (3)–(6) do not have an analytical solution. Numer-
ical integration is then performed in the steady state.

A. Faraday conﬁguration

In the Faraday conﬁguration, the probe laser is prop-
agating along the magnetic ﬁeld such that ˆu = k/k = ˆz.
The eigenmodes of the ﬁeld are the left and right circular
polarizations. We note that the excited state |0(cid:105) remains
uncoupled to the light ﬁeld.
The linear regime occurs when the probe beam has an
intensity I (cid:28) Isat, where Isat = 3 µWcm−2 is the satura-
tion intensity. Here, Eqs. (3)–(6) can be solved analyti-
cally. In the weak magnetic ﬁeld limit, i.e. geµbB (cid:28) Γ,
the mismatch of the refractive indices of the two eigen-
modes is given by [16]:

when the laser is at resonance, the index of refraction

It is linked to the optical thickness at nonzero

ticular, the linear dependence of θ with respect to the op-
tical thickness. Moreover, in the high temperature limit,

Thus, for a probe beam tuned on the resonance of the

For a typical Strontium cold gas, one has L/b0 ∼ 200 µm.
We then ﬁnd a Verdet constant of: |VB| ∼ 1010 rad/Tm.
It is more than three orders of magnitude larger than the
values reported for standard alkali cold gasses [16–18].

B. Voigt conﬁguration

In the Voigt conﬁguration, the magnetic ﬁeld is per-
pendicular to the probe propagation direction. It forms
an angle of 45◦ with respect to the polarization of the
probe ﬁeld. As depicted on Fig. 1(a), we choose ˆu = ˆy
and ˆp = ˆz. The eigenmodes of the ﬁeld are the two linear
polarization components along the z -axis and the x -axis.
For I (cid:28) Isat, and in the weak magnetic ﬁeld limit, i.e.
geµbB (cid:28) Γ, the index of refraction mismatch between
the two eigenmodes for a velocity class v is [16]:

Thus, when the laser is at resonance, the index of refrac-
tion mismatch is imaginary. The Voigt rotation comes
from a pure dichroism eﬀect and scales like the square of
the magnetic ﬁeld. If the optical thickness is small, the
polarization of the initial electric ﬁeld is rotated by:

θ = ikL∆n/2

(15)

IV. FARADAY ROTATION

The rotation of the probe laser polarization as function
of the applied magnetic ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 2. In the
LMOR regime, i.e.
for a weak probe intensity (see the

4

(see for example the red curve in Fig. 2). The proﬁle be-
fore the transform corresponds to the absorption proﬁle
of an EIT scheme (see for example Fig. 2 in ref. [20]).
From the ﬁt, we extract the width of the NMOR con-
tribution which is shown in the inset in Fig. 2. We plot
here the square of this width to clearly indicate its lin-
ear dependency. The orange line is a linear ﬁt using the
expression ∆B2
0 (1 + I/(2Isat)). We ﬁnd ∆B0 = 3.7 mG.
Since Γ/(geµb) = 3.6 mG, the empirical Eq. (16) is well
veriﬁed on the experiment. We do not observe a subnat-
ural linewidth in contrast to some experiments done in
EIT scheme [20, 21].

We now study the sensitivity dθ/dB of the Faraday
rotation at the vicinity of B = 0. As it is shown in
Fig. 2, the sensitivity is negative at low intensity and
becomes positive at larger intensity. A study of the sen-
sitivity as a function of the probe intensity, at T = 1 µK,
is summarized in Fig. 3. The experimental sensitivity is
about 0.8 times lower than the theoretical prediction cor-
responding to the numerical integration of Eqs. (3)–(6)
(see the green solid curve in Fig. 2). This discrepancy
may be due to systematic eﬀects such as ﬁnite linewidth
of our probe laser [17], unbalanced polarization channel
or an overestimate of the cloud optical thickness. At
I ∼ 2Isat, the sensitivity goes to zero, meaning that the
LMOR and NMOR eﬀects cancel out.
Increasing fur-
ther I, the sensitivity reaches an optimal positive value
at I ∼ 10Isat. At larger probe intensity, the sensitiv-
ity decreases smoothly toward zero because of the power
broadening of the transition. We observe, in the results of
the numerical integrations, the same qualitative behavior
for various temperatures. However, at low temperature
(see the red dashed curve for T = 0 in Fig. 3) the cance-
lation between the LMOR and NMOR eﬀects occurs at
large probe intensity. Indeed, according to Eq. (9) the
LMOR is maximal at T = 0 whereas the NMOR is tem-
perature independent. For a similar reason, at higher
temperature, the cancelation between the LMOR and
NMOR eﬀects occurs at a lower intensity of the probe
beam.

Next, we study the sensitivity as a function of the op-
tical thickness. According to Eq. (9), for a given temper-
ature, we expect the sensitivity to be linearly dependent
on the optical thickness b¯v in the LMOR regime. It is
observed in the experiment, as shown in Fig. 4 (see the
red open circles). Here, the temperature is T = 1 µK,
thus the sensitivity should be reduced by a factor 0.05
with respect to the zero temperature values given in
Eq. (12). The experimentally measured sensitivity are
in good agreement with the theoretical prediction given
by Eq. (9) even though it is slightly lower by a factor
of typically 0.8. The possible reasons for this diﬀerence
were pointed out earlier.
In Fig. 4, experimental data
corresponding to high probe intensities are also shown.
As for LMOR, we observe a linear dependency of the
sensitivity with respect to the optical thickness. The
optical thickness values are extracted from transmission
measurements performed at low probe intensity. The nu-

the probe intensity. The black open circles, blue crossess,
green triangles and the red squares correspond respectively to
the rotation angles at I = 0.1Isat, I = 2.3Isat, I = 7.9Isat and
I = 33.6Isat. The black and red curves are results from ﬁts
(see the main text for more details). The temperature of the
cold gas is T = 1 µK. Inset: Square of the ﬁtted width of the

black open circles in Fig. 2), we observe a dispersive-like
curve with a negative slope at the origin, in agreement
with Eq. (9). The largest rotation is observed at around
|B| =11 mG instead of Γ/(geµb) = 3.6 mG. This is
due to the Doppler broadening associated to the cloud
temperature of 1.5 µK. The proﬁle corresponds to the
Hilbert transform of a Voigt proﬁle [19]. We perform
this transformation and ﬁt it to the experimental data
(see the black curve in Fig. 2).

When the probe intensity is increased above the satu-
ration intensity, a narrow anomalous dispersive-like curve
appears with a positive slope at its origin (see Ref. [6] for
the ﬁrst observation in a Samarium vapor). This anoma-
lous Faraday rotation is associated to the NMOR eﬀect.
It emerges from the coherence ˆσ−1+1 between the excited
substates |−1(cid:105) and |+1(cid:105). This coherence has a lifetime of
Γ, thus, it is expected to play a role if I (cid:38) Is. Moreover,
since ˆσ−1+1 is due to photon redistribution between the
two circular eigenmodes, it is insensitive to Doppler fre-
quency shift. Thus, in a Doppler broadened sample, the
anomalous dispersion curve could be narrower than the
dispersion curve associated with LMOR. More precisely,
the width of the anomalous dispersion curve is expected
to be equal to the power broadened linewidth, i.e.

(cid:112)1 + I/(2Isat).

Here, the intensity is divided by two, which is the inten-

whereas its optical thickness is b¯v = 1.6. Theoretical predic-
tions are respectively at T = 0 (red dotted curve), T = 10 µK
(blue dashed curve), and at 1 µK, which is the same tempera-
ture as in the experiment (green solid curve). The dash-dotted
curve corresponds to the theoretical curve reduced by a factor
of 0.8. This is in good agreement with the experimental data
(black open circles).

Figure 4: Sensitivity of the Faraday rotation as function of the
optical thickness for diﬀerent probe intensity values. The red
open circles, green crosses, blue triangles and black squares
correspond respectively to I = 0.1Isat, I = 4.8Isat, I = 8.4Isat
and I = 16.8Isat. The theoretical predictions for these probe
intensities are, respectively, given by the red solid curve, the
green dashed curve, the blue dotted curve and the black dash-
dotted curve. The temperature of the cold gas is T=1 µK.

merical simulations of Eqs. (3)–(6) show that the linear
dependency of the sensitivity is well fulﬁlled at low b¯v but
might be not correct for larger b¯v (see for example the
I = 5Isat green dashed curve at b¯v ≥ 2 in Fig. 4). The
breakdown of the linear dependence on b¯v has a simple
explanation.
It is due to the probe absorption in the
medium. Thus, the probe saturates the medium only at
its entrance but not anymore at its deeper layers. The
sensitivity, therefore, becomes smaller at larger values of
the optical thickness.

Finally, we discuss the dependence of the sensitivity
as a function of the temperature of the cold gas. Ex-
amples in the LMOR and NMOR regimes are shown in
Fig. 5. To avoid variations of the optical thickness due to
the preparation of the cold gas at diﬀerent temperature,
we deﬁne a normalized sensitivity (dθ/dB)b−1
¯v , with the
sensitivity divided by the optical thickness. Importantly,
this procedure is justiﬁed because the optical thickness is
bv = 0.8(0.2) which is weak enough for the sensitivity to
be proportional to b¯v for any probe intensity used in the
experiment. In the LMOR regime, the absolute sensitiv-
ity decays as 1/
T at large temperature (see Eq. (10) and
its representation as the black dashed curve in Fig. 5).
The exact solution, given by Eq. (9), is represented by the
red solid curve. The red dashed curve, which is the theo-
retical curve scaled by a factor of 0.8, matches well with
the experimental data points represented by the red dots.
In the NMOR regime, the absolute sensitivity increases
with temperature (see blue open circles in Fig. 5). Here,
again the theoretical prediction has to be multiplied by a
factor of 0.8 to obtain a good agreement with the exper-
imental data points (see the dash-dotted and the dashed

√

curves). At high temperature, the sensitivity saturates
to |dθ/dB|b−1
¯v = 0.051 rad/mG. This saturation has a
simple explanation.
It occurs once the Doppler broad-
ening has the same order of magnitude than the power
broadening. Further increasing the temperature will not
increase the number of atoms participating in the NMOR
signal, leading to a saturation of the sensitivity.

V. VOIGT ROTATION

Similar to the Faraday rotation, the Voigt rotation
shows qualitatively diﬀerent behavior between weak and
strong probe intensity. At weak intensity (see the blue
open circles in Fig. 6), we observe a quadratic dependence
of the rotation angle to the magnetic ﬁeld, as predicted
by Eqs. (14)–(15). At larger probe intensity (see the red
ﬁlled circles corresponding to I = 12Isat in Fig. 6), an
anomalous NMOR with positive curvature is observed.
This anomalous Voigt eﬀect has a similar origin as in the
case of Faraday rotation. It is due to coherence among
the excited substates. For Faraday rotation, only the
|−1(cid:105) and |+1(cid:105) excited substates are concerned. Here,
the substate |0(cid:105) is also coupled to the light ﬁeld, leading
to an extra coherence contributions.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have reported studies of the linear and nonlinear
magneto-optical rotation on a cold strontium cloud us-
ing the 689 nm intercombination line. Using moderately
Doppler broadened samples, both LMOR and NMOR are

clearly observed in the experiments for the Faraday and
the Voigt conﬁgurations. In this regime, NMOR gives a
feature narrower than LMOR because of its insensitivity
to Doppler frequency shift. In particular, we show that,
at large temperature, only NMOR is present and gives a
signiﬁcant contribution at large intensity.

To the best of our knowledge, the strontium intercom-
bination line is the narrowest one-photon transition used
so far to study magneto-optical rotation. Our best sensi-
tivity of dθ/dB = 0.06 rad/mG is measured for b¯v = 2.6,
and T=1 µK in the linear regime. This value is roughly
a factor of 50 times smaller than the maximal value ex-
pected at T = 0. The corresponding Verdet constant is
VB ∼ 3 × 108 rad/Tm. This value is typically two orders
of magnitude larger than the values reported for stan-
dard alkali cold gas [16–18]. The large Verdet constant
might be promising to develop a sensitive optical mag-
netometer based on a low temperature strontium gas on
the intercombination line. However, the LMOR regime
is obtained only when the probe intensity is lower than
the saturation intensity Isat. Since Isat is proportional to
Γ, we expect that the ultimate performance of an pho-
tons short noise limited optical magnetometer, based on
LMOR, would be independent of the linewidth of the
transition. In the NMOR regime such restriction on the
probe intensity does not occur. Thus a new optical mag-
netometer based on NMOR on a narrow transition might
be considered.

Figure 5: Absolute value of the sensitivity of the Faraday
rotation as function of the temperature for intensities of
I = 0.1Isat (red dots) and I = 15Isat (blue open circles).
At T=2.5 µK (vertical arrow), the sensitivity values are the
same for both NMOR and LMOR. The red solid and the
blue dash-dotted curves are the theoretical predictions, re-
spectively, at low and high intensities whereas the red dashed
and the short blue dotted curves are the theoretical predic-
tion curves multiplied by 0.8. The horizontal arrow gives the
predicted sensitivity in the NMOR regime when the temper-
ature goes to inﬁnity. The black dashed curve is the high
temperature limit for LMOR corresponding to Eq. (10).

Figure 6: Magneto-optical rotation in the Voigt conﬁguration.
The data blue open circles and red ﬁlled circle correspond
respectively to I = 0.1Isat and I = 12Isat. The solid blue
and red curves correspond to numerical simulation results.
The temperature of the sample is T=1 µK and the optical
thickness is b¯v = 1.4.
