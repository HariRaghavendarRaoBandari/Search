Resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) was used to determine the pressure dependence of
the f-electron occupancy in the Kondo insulator SmB6. Applied pressure reduces the f-occupancy,
but surprisingly, the material maintains a signiﬁcant divalent character up to a pressure of at least
35 GPa. Thus, the closure of the resistive activation energy gap and onset of magnetic order are
not driven by stabilization of an integer valent state. Over the entire pressure range, the material
maintains a remarkably stable intermediate valence that can in principle support a nontrivial band
structure.

The study of intermediate valent compounds, which
dates back half a century [1], has recently been reinvig-
orated by the possibility that Kondo insulators harbor a
topological surface state [2]. The best-studied candidate
material is SmB6 [3, 4], which was only recently shown
to be electrically insulating in the bulk [5–7]. Although
activated electrical transport is readily inferred from the
dramatic temperature-dependent resistivity, at low tem-
peratures the resistivity saturates at a ﬁnite value instead
of diverging to inﬁnity. This anomalous behavior is now
linked to the presence of electrically conducting surface
states [8], and many experiments have been directed at
determining the topological classiﬁcation of the material
[9–20]. A full description of the underlying strongly cor-
related electron state is key to understanding nontrivial
topology in f-electron materials.

Applied pressure is a powerful tool for studying inter-
mediate valent systems because their electronic states are
sensitive to small changes in interatomic separation. A
well-known example of this behavior is SmS, in which the
divalent “black” phase is dramatically transformed into
a semiconducting intermediate valent “gold” phase by
the application of very modest pressure of 0.6 GPa [21].
As pressure increases, Sm becomes fully trivalent and it
magnetically orders [22–24]. SmB6 follows this example:
an intermediate valence exists already at ambient pres-
sure [25], and the valence is sensitive to temperature [26]
and chemical pressure [27]. Applied pressure stabilizes
a metallic and magnetic ground state over the range 4-
10 GPa [28–30] and increases the Sm valence [31, 32]. By
analogy, a pressure-induced trivalent state is anticipated
in SmB6, but it has not yet been shown spectroscopi-
cally, nor is it known how its onset correlates with either
metallization or magnetic order [29].

Unexpectedly, our experiment shows that an interme-
diate valent state in SmB6 persists to the highest mea-
sured pressures, about 35 GPa, and shows no signs of
tending towards saturation. This unprecedented discov-
ery implies that neither the metallization nor the onset
of magnetic order are associated with simple integer va-
lency, but are characteristics of a robust intermediate-
valent state. Such a state violates the paradigm that
valence ﬂuctuations destabilize spins on long time scales,
and demands a new model of f-electron valence stabil-
ity. Most intriguingly, the coexistence of magnetism and
topologically nontrivial intermediate bulk valence [3] may
help explain recent suggestions of metallic magnetism on
the surface of SmB6 [19, 20].

X-ray emission spectroscopy, which probes the local
electronic conﬁguration of atoms, is a valuable discrimi-
nator of multivalent ions. The measurement involves two
coupled transitions: 1) an electron in a low-lying core or-
bital is excited into the conduction band via absorption of
an x-ray photon, and 2) an electron from another orbital
decays to ﬁll the hole, emitting a lower-energy x-ray pho-
ton. The ﬁnal state of the system is excited with respect
to the initial state. A schematic of the excitations studied
in our experiment is presented in Fig. 1a. The removal
of the core electron from the 2p shell, corresponding
to the LIII absorption edge, requires an incident energy
Ei ≈ 6720 eV, the exact value of which depends on the
4f shell electron occupancy.
In intermediate-valent Sm
compounds, x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) mea-
surements yield two peaks, split by 7 eV, that correspond
to integer-occupancy f5 and f6 conﬁgurations [26]. This
is due to the short-lived, local nature of the core-hole ex-
citation and its f-occupancy-dependent Coulomb screen-
ing. One possible relaxation pathway is for an electron

with energy Ef = 5636 eV (the Lα1 emission line) that
is independent of the 4f shell occupancy.

We performed X-ray Diﬀraction (XRD), Partial Flu-
orescence Yield (PFY), and Resonant X-ray Emission
Spectroscopy (RXES) measurements under pressure at
the HPCAT beamline at the Advanced Photon Source.
The XRD measurements were performed on a powder of
crushed single crystals of SmB6 [5] using a 29.2 keV x-
ray beam. For the inelastic measurements, a ﬂux-grown
50 µm single crystal was studied using a 35 µm diameter
x-ray beam in a diamond anvil cell sealed with a Be gas-
ket. Approximately hydrostatic pressure conditions were
achieved using neon as a medium, and manometry via
ruby ﬂuorescence indicated typically 5% uncertainty in
the pressure.

The PFY experiment consists of a measurement of the
intensity at ﬁxed Ef as a function of scanned Ei. The
intensity is proportional to the absorption probability,
but the measured emission linewidths have the advan-
tage of being intrinsically sharper compared to standard
XAS measurements (compare to [26]). Because the x-ray
absorption process represents an ejection of a photoelec-
tron, details of the absorption edge reﬂect the unoccupied
density of states. In SmB6, a large unoccupied density of
states due to a d-derived band leads to a peak structure
similar to that seen in other f-electron compounds. The

pressure dependence of Lα1-PFY scans across the LIII
edge are presented in Fig. 1b. The presence of two promi-
nent peaks corresponding to diﬀerent integer f-occupancy
is consistent with prior x-ray absorption and photoelec-
tron spectroscopy on SmB6 [25].

To get a complete picture of the energy dependence
of the resonant absorption-emission process, we also per-
formed RXES measurements, in which both Ei and Ef
are varied. Data from RXES scans at diﬀerent pressures
are shown in Fig. 2 as a function of Ei and the trans-
ferred energy Et = Ei − Ef . For reference, a gray diag-
onal line having constant Ef indicates the trajectory of
the previously-discussed PFY measurements. The RXES
lineshape resembles the PFY, broadened along Ei and

sity is a sum of two terms with spectral weight propor-
tional to the relative contribution of each valence conﬁg-
uration. The amplitude Φ ∝ |hf| T2 |iihi| T1 |gi|2 is de-
termined by the transition probabilities between ground,
intermediate, and ﬁnal states. Its value is approximately
constant over the relevant energies, although an asymme-
try along Ei is well described by assigning to Φ a skewness

The contribution from the 2+ peak in the RXES spec-
trum clearly diminishes with increasing pressure. The
amplitudes from the ﬁts to Eqn. 2 support the interme-
diate valence derived from our PFY analysis, and such

FIG. 2. Comparison of RXES data (a-c) and ﬁts (d-f) at dif-

an interpretation of RXES data is also previously estab-
lished [33, 36]. Figure 3 summarizes our ﬁndings, includ-
ing the pressure dependence of several important energy
scales. The valence at 10 GPa is 0.1 smaller than deter-
mined by earlier XAS measurements [31, 32]. The slope
of the valence as a function of pressure is greatest near
2.5, a behavior attributable to near-degeneracy of the
divalent and trivalent conﬁgurations [37]. The splitting
∆ǫ between absorption edges for each valence decreases
from 8.5 eV to 6.5 eV between ambient pressure and 26
GPa, reﬂecting less of a diﬀerence in screening between
the two conﬁgurations. The width Γi increases from 5 eV
to 6 eV, while the value for Γt remains constant at 2 eV.
These linewidths are consistent with those derived from
studies of other f-electron compounds [34].

These ﬁndings challenge conventional understanding of
intermediate valent insulators. The monotonic pressure
dependence of the valence in SmB6 is insensitive to both
the closing of the hybridization gap and sharp onset of
long-range magnetic order, and other energy scales are

FIG. 3. Pressure dependence of the room-temperature Sm va-
lence in SmB6. The smooth pressure dependence is insensitive
to the transition from an insulating nonmagnetic ground state
to magnetic metal, which occurs over a pressure range indi-
cated by the gray lines, and a robust intermediate valent state
is maintained. Top: The energy parameters derived from ﬁts
to Eqn. 2 and the lattice parameter also exhibit a smooth pres-
sure dependence independent of the change in ground state.
Inset: This behavior contrasts starkly with the archetypal
pressure-induced valence transition in SmS [24]. Uncertainty
of one standard deviation in the valence is smaller than the
plotted points.

also continuous through these transitions. This is re-
markable because both the Fermi surface and magnetic
ground state are expected to be determined by f-electron
ﬂuctuations, as seen in other rare earth compounds.
Most striking is that the Sm valence in SmB6 not only
never reaches 3+, but remains strongly intermediate va-
lent at high pressures, defying predictions [29, 30, 38, 39].
The unusual electronic conﬁguration is surprisingly ro-
bust.

Fluctuations of the charge conﬁguration of unpaired
f-electrons aﬀect the spin state, reducing the paramag-
netic response and impeding magnetic order [40]. A
well-known example is Ce metal, which undergoes an
isostructural volume collapse under pressure that changes
its valence and suppresses the Curie-Weiss paramagnetic
response [41]. Both metallic and insulating Kondo lat-
tice compounds can be described by a periodic Ander-
son model, a fact exploited in the classiﬁcation of topo-
logical Kondo insulators [2]. As a practical matter, al-
though there are many examples of metallic intermedi-
ate valent compounds, whose designation overlaps with

heavy fermion materials, very few intermediate valent
compounds exhibit electrical insulating behavior down
to low temperatures [42].

The archetypal intermediate valent insulator is SmS,
in which pressure-induced magnetic order and metalliza-
tion are associated with the onset of full 3+ valence. This
material exhibits a prominent ﬁrst order transition in the
lattice constant at 1 GPa, which is coupled to a large
jump in valence from 2 to 2.7 [23, 24]. Above 2 GPa,
magnetic order sets in [22] inside the intermediate va-
lent regime, but the magnetic phase does not occupy the
entire volume until 5 GPa, when the sample is nearly
trivalent. A coincidence between volume change, metal-
lization, and valence change is observed also in Sm, Tm,
and Yb monochalcogenides [43, 44].

The trend in pressure-tuned ground state is obeyed by
SmB6, as it becomes magnetically ordered below 12 K
[29, 45] once the insulating gap closes by 10 GPa [30]. Yet
despite the similar phase diagrams of SmB6 and SmS, the
pressure dependence of the Sm valence is very diﬀerent
(Fig. 3 inset), and our experiment shows that the incon-
sistency with integer valence in SmB6 under pressure is
more substantial than suggested previously [29, 38]. The
root of this discrepancy lies in the pressure dependence of
the SmB6 lattice constant determined via XRD (Fig. 3),
which decreases smoothly as a function of applied pres-
sure [39] to values greater than 25 GPa [46] and does not
collapse. Indeed, the lattice of SmB6 may be considered
already collapsed, as the bulk modulus [46] is three times
larger than that of SmS [47].

A correspondence between lattice parameter and va-
lence is an established component of the intermediate
valence phenomenology.
It intuitively derives from the
diﬀerent radii of the stable integer valent ions, which
contract with increasing valence. In SmB6, this rule has
been inferred from comparisons of XAS and magnetome-
try on chemically substituted samples that demonstrate
a relation between lattice constant and valence [27, 32].
It also appears to be responsible for the unusual ambient-
pressure negative coeﬃcient of thermal expansion [48]
that is accompanied by a valence decrease as the tem-
perature is lowered [26]. Yet, these arguments do not
simply extend to the pressure data; already by 10 GPa
the experimentally determined lattice constant is 4.05 ˚A
(Fig. 3), far smaller than the 4.115 ˚A value of hypotheti-
cal trivalent SmB6 derived from substitution studies [27].
The failure of ion size alone to determine valence is rem-
iniscent of the limitations of simple promotional mod-
els to describe gradual valence changes beyond the Sm
monochalcogenides [43], at which point it becomes neces-
sary to invoke hybridization to describe the intermediate
valent state. The fact that SmB6 is already far from inte-
ger valence at ambient pressure underscores that correla-
tions play an essential role in determining the electronic
state [4, 49]. Our results highlight the need for new the-
oretical insight into why the SmB6 valence is sensitive to

4

temperature but less so to applied pressure, and what un-
derlying interactions are responsible for the metallization
and onset of magnetic order.

Finally, we address eﬀorts to experimentally determine
the topological classiﬁcation of SmB6. Because theoreti-
cal calculations suggest that SmB6 is topologically non-
trivial at all experimentally relevant values of valence [3],
pressure is not expected to tune the material through a
topological transition until integer valence is achieved. In
principle, opening an energy gap at the Fermi level at any
pressure converts SmB6 into a topological insulator, and
if the onset of magnetic order could be decoupled from
metallization, a strain-engineered interface between mag-
net and topological insulator could be used to stabilize
exotic edge states with potential use in future devices.
In this light, we suggest that recent observations of one-
dimensional surface transport [19] and unusual magneto-
transport [20] could be consistent with the existence of a
strain-stabilized magnetic surface on SmB6. Our results
demonstrate that a surface having strongly intermediate
valence, as has been detected spectroscopically [50], can
support magnetic order.
