ABSTRACT

A historical problem for indirect exoplanet detection has been contending with the intrinsic vari-
ability of the host star. If the variability is periodic, it can easily mimic various exoplanet signatures,
such as radial velocity variations that originate with the stellar surface rather than the presence of
a planet. Here we present an update for the HD 99492 planetary system, using new radial veloc-
ity and photometric measurements from the Transit Ephemeris Reﬁnement and Monitoring Survey
(TERMS). Our extended time series and subsequent analyses of the Ca II H&K emission lines show
that the host star has an activity cycle of ∼13 years. The activity cycle correlates with the purported
orbital period of the outer planet, the signature of which is thus likely due to the host star activity.
We further include a revised Keplerian orbital solution for the remaining planet, along with a new
transit ephemeris. Our transit-search observations were inconclusive.

1. INTRODUCTION

The radial velocity (RV) technique remains one of the
most successful methods for the discovery of exoplane-
tary systems. At the present time, more than 500 exo-
planets have been discovered using the RV technique, in-
cluding a vast range of multi-planet systems and orbital
conﬁgurations. The success of this method is greatly
dependent upon the ability to accurately characterize
the properties of the host star. In particular, the evo-
lution of star spots, magnetic ﬁelds, and pulsations have
well-studied eﬀects on stellar radial velocity variations
(Saar & Donahue 1997; Queloz et al. 2001; Desort et al.
2007; H´ebrard et al. 2014). There have been numerous
recent cases where stellar activity has posed a signiﬁcant
problem in the correct interpretation of RV data (Hatzes
2013; Hatzes et al. 2015; Robertson et al. 2014, 2015).

One source of activity-induced RV variations is that
due to stellar activity cycles, analogous to the 11-year
Solar cycle. Dravins (1985) predicted such a correla-
tion, and Deming et al. (1987) reported the detection

of such a correlation in the solar CO lines at 2.3µm,
and inferred an amplitude of 30 m s−1 from the eﬀect.
Wright et al. (2008) argued that experience with the
hundreds of sun-like stars from the California Planet Sur-
vey (CPS) showed that such eﬀects are not so strong,
and that activity cycles were probably not to blame
for a ∼15 m s−1 RV variation in phase with an activ-
ity cycle in HD 154345. Similar high-amplitude RV-
activity correlations in individual targets have been re-
ported by Moutou et al. (2011), Carolo et al. (2014), and
Robertson et al. (2013). Nonetheless,
for most stars
such correlations are small or absent, as argued by
Wright et al. (2008) and Santos et al. (2010).

The star HD 99492 is an early-K dwarf in a binary orbit
with HD 99491 (also known as 83 Leonis B and A, respec-
tively). HD 99492 has a parallax of 55.7 ± 1.46 marcsec
and a distance of 17.96±0.47 pcs (van Leeuwen 2007a,b).
The mean angular separation of the stellar components
is 40.76′′, leading to an average projected separation of
∼730 AU. HD 99492 was found to harbor a 0.1 MJ planet
in a 17 day orbit by Marcy et al. (2005). The best-ﬁt
Keplerian orbital solution at that time included a lin-
ear trend to account for a possible second companion
in the system. The orbital elements were updated by
Meschiari et al. (2011), who claimed to have resolved the
separate orbit of an outer planet with a period of ∼5000
days.

Here we present new results for the system that re-
veal an activity cycle in the star and further show that
stellar activity amply explains the signature of the outer
planet (c). Section 2 provides new fundamental stellar
parameters, including spectral analysis, discussion of ele-
ment abundances, and activity indices from the complete
dataset of 130 Keck/HIRES spectra. Section 3 presents
our revised Keplerian orbital solution, including the cor-
relation of the outer planet signature with the activity
indices. Section 4 includes photometry from 5 observing
seasons acquired over a span of 11 years. The photomet-
ric data conﬁrms the absence of brightness variations in

phase with the orbital period of planet b, thus conﬁrming
the radial velocity variations in HD 99492 on a 17 day
cycle are due to planetary reﬂex motion. Our limited
number of brightness measurements near the predicted
phase of planetary transit show no evidence for a transit
but fall short of ruling them out. We provide concluding
remarks in Section 5.

2. STELLAR PROPERTIES

2.1. Fundamental Parameters

The fundamental properties of HD 99492 have been
previously determined, for example by Valenti & Fischer
(2005); Takeda et al. (2007). We used an upgraded ver-
sion of the Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) package to
model a Keck/HIRES spectrum of HD 99492. Details of
the SME package may be found in Valenti & Piskunov
(1996); Valenti & Fischer (2005). Brieﬂy, SME uses
an iterative technique that combines model atmo-
sphere analysis with Yonsei-Yale model
isochrones
(Demarque et al. 2004) that utilize Hipparcos photome-
try and distances (van Leeuwen 2007a,b). This approach
produces a self-consistent convergence with the measured
surface gravity (Valenti et al. 2009).

The results of our analysis are shown in Table 1, includ-
ing values for the surface gravity log g, rotational velocity
v sin i, atmospheric abundance [Fe/H], eﬀective tempera-
ture Teﬀ and stellar isochrone solution (mass M⋆, radius
R⋆, and age). These parameters are consistent with pre-
vious estimates of the stellar properties and demonstrate
that HD 99492 is a late-G/early-K dwarf with an age
similar to the Sun.

2.2. Stellar Abundances

groups

to-date,

The element abundances of HD 99492 have been
measured only by two
namely
Valenti & Fischer (2005) and Petigura & Marcy (2011).
To correct for varying solar abundance normaliza-
tions, per the analysis within the Hypatia Catalog
(Hinkel et al. 2014), each dataset was re-normalized to
the Lodders et al. (2009) scale. The [Fe/H] measurement
per both groups is 0.40 dex, since Petigura & Marcy
(2011) adopted the stellar parameters and iron abun-
dance from Valenti & Fischer (2005) in their analysis.

From Petigura & Marcy (2011), [O/H] = 0.25 dex while
Valenti & Fischer (2005) determined [Na/H] = 0.41,
[Si/H] = 0.34 dex, [Ti/H] = 0.28 dex, and [Ni/H] =
0.38 dex. These results reveal a star that is markedly
super-solar in both the volatile and refractory elements.

2.3. Stellar Activity

HD 99492 has been spectroscopically monitored us-
ing the HIRES echelle spectrometer (Vogt et al. 1994)
on the 10.0m Keck I telescope as part of the CPS.
For Keck/HIRES instrument conﬁguration details, see
Wright et al. (2004); Howard et al. (2009). Our com-
plete HIRES dataset contains 130 measurements span-
ning over 18 years, extending the time baseline of the
data reported by Meschiari et al. (2011) by over 5 years.
The pipeline that extracts the RVs from the spectra (see
Section 3) also extracts Ca II H&K line-proﬁle variations
and provides an index of stellar activity (Noyes et al.
1984). These data are calibrated to the Mt. Wilson
S-values, deﬁned as the ratio of the sum of the ﬂux in
the H&K line cores to the sum of the two continuum
bands on either side (Wilson 1968). We include data ac-
quired both before and after the upgrade of the HIRES
CCD in 2004 August (Isaacson & Fischer 2010), taking
into account the oﬀset between pre-2004 and post-2004
calibrated datasets.

The time series of S-values are shown in the left panel
of Figure 1. The periodic variation in S indicates that
we have observed just over one complete cycle of stellar
activity in the host star. To quantify the variation, we
performed a fourier analysis of the time series, resulting
in the periodogram shown in the right panel of Figure 1.
This analysis reveals a broad peak in the power spec-
trum that lies between 3000–5000 days, with maximum
power occurring at ∼3650 days. The S-value periodicity
is thus consistent with the HD 99492c orbital period of
4970 ± 744 days determined by Meschiari et al. (2011).
We elaborate further on the correlation between stellar
activity and possible planetary signature in Section 3.

3. AN UPDATE TO THE PLANETARY SYSTEM

The RV measurements were extracted from the
Keck/HIRES data with the use of an iodine cell
mounted at the spectrometer entrance slit as a ro-

bust source of wavelength calibration (Marcy & Butler
1992; Valenti et al. 1995). The modeling procedure
for the Doppler shift of each stellar spectrum with re-
spect to the iodine spectrum is described further in
Howard et al. (2009). The discovery orbital solution for
the HD 99492 system by Marcy et al. (2005) included
a linear trend component. The 93 RV measurements
utilized by Meschiari et al. (2011) used a two-planet or-
bital solution to account for the previously-noted linear
trend. A two-planet ﬁt to our expanded dataset is able
to recover a similar orbital solution to that previously
found by Meschiari et al. (2011). Considering the peri-
odic stellar activity described in Section 2.3 as a source
for the previously observed linear trend and purported
second planet, we performed a single-planet ﬁt to our
dataset of 130 RV measurements, both with and with-
out a linear trend included. These ﬁts were carried out
using RVLIN, a partially-linearized, least-squares ﬁtting
procedure described in Wright & Howard (2009). The
uncertainties in the resulting orbital parameters were es-
timated using the BOOTTRAN bootstrapping routines
described in Wang et al. (2012). We included a stellar
jitter noise component of 4 m s−1 in quadrature with the
measurement uncertainties (Wright 2005; Butler et al.
2006). With our new dataset and its increased times-
pan, we ﬁnd no evidence of a signiﬁcant diﬀerence be-
tween the orbital ﬁts that do and do not include a linear
trend. We thus adopt the solution without the linear
trend for which the complete orbital solution is shown in
Table 1 and in the top panel of Figure 2. Note that the
γ parameter shown in Table 1 is the systemic velocity
of the system with respect to the zero point of the ex-
tracted RVs and thus is the systemic velocity relative to
the template spectrum. The complete RV dataset of 130
measurements of HD 99492 are listed in Table 2.

To investigate further the impact of stellar activity on a
two-planet solution (see Section 2.3), we compared the S-
values with the RV residuals of the single-planet solution
shown in Table 1. The resulting correlation diagram is
shown in the bottom panel of Figure 2. We quantiﬁed the
signiﬁcance of the correlation using the Spearman rank
correlation coeﬃcient. The Spearman coeﬃcient lies in
the range −1 < rs < 1, and, in turn, gives the prob-
ability that the two quantities being examined are not
correlated. The Spearman coeﬃcient for the data shown
in the bottom panel of Figure 2 is rs = 0.39, indicative
of a positive correlation. The corresponding probability
that the residuals of the single-planet solution and the
S-values would produce the observed correlation if those
quantities were in fact uncorrelated is 1.2 × 10−5. We
conducted a further test via an extensive Monte-Carlo
simulation that performs a Fisher-Yates shuﬄe, random-
izing the order of the residual data values. For each real-
ization, the Spearman’s rank correlation coeﬃcient and
probability were recalculated. This test resulted in a 0.5
probability of null-correlation, indicating that the corre-
lation found above is robust. This implies, in turn, that
the second planet claimed by Meschiari et al. (2011) is
instead the result of stellar activity.

The T12 telescope acquired 368 nightly observations
of HD 99492 during the 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, and
2014 observing seasons. These data are plotted against
Heliocentirc Julian Date in the top panel of Figure 3.
The observations are insuﬃcient to detect the long-
term activity cycle described in Section 2.3. Therefore,
we removed very small season-to-season variability in
HD 99492 and/or its comparison stars by normalizing
the ﬁnal four observing seasons so their means match
the ﬁrst season, indicated by the horizonal dotted line in
the top panel. This removal of seasonal variability allows
a more sensitive search for variability that might be due
to rotational modulation of star spots (e.g., Henry et al.
2013). Marcy et al. (2005) estimated the rotation period
of HD 99492 to be around 45 days from the Ca II H and
K emission strength. Our nightly observations scatter
about the mean with a standard deviation 0.00484 mag,
somewhat more than the typical measurement precision.
However, Fourier analyses of the complete normalized
data set and the individual observing seasons did not re-
veal any signiﬁcant periodicities between 1 and 100 days
that might correspond to the star’s rotation period.

We further examined publicly available photomet-
ric data from the Hipparcos satellite to search for ev-
idence of periodicity in the lightcurve of HD 99492
(Perryman et al. 1997; van Leeuwen 2007a). The data
were extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive
(Akeson et al. 2013), including 71 measurements span-
ning a period of 1,062 days and with a standard deviation
of 0.135 mag. Our fourier analysis of the Hipparcos did
not reveal strong periodicity, with the possible exception
of a minor fourier power at ∼15.8 days.

The Keplerian orbital solution in Section 3 includes
an estimate of Tc, the predicted time of mid-transit
should the planetary orbital inclination be suitably close
to edge-on. To determine the remainder of the pre-
dicted transit parameters, we adopted the SME stel-
lar radius from Table 1 and an estimated planetary ra-
dius of Rp = 0.52 RJ using the mass-radius relation-
ship described by Kane & Gelino (2012). Taking into
account the orbital eccentricity from the Keplerian or-
bit (Kane & von Braun 2008), the transit probability is
2.8% and the predicted duration and depth for a central
transit are 0.181 days and 0.54% respectively.

The APT observations are replotted in the middle
panel of Figure 3. These data are phased with the or-
bital period and the predicted transit time shown in Ta-
ble 1. We use least-squares to ﬁt a sine curve to the
data, also phased on the 17.054-day orbital period. This
yields a formal semi-amplitude of the sine curve of just
0.00041 ± 0.000033 mag. The relatively small amplitude
conﬁrms that the observed RV variations are due to the
presence of a planet rather than intrinsic stellar bright-
ness variations.

The APT observations within ±0.06 phase units of the
predicted transit time are shown in the bottom panel of

Fig. 3.— Top: Nightly photometric observations of HD 99492
from the 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, and 2014 observing seasons ac-
quired with the T12 0.8 m APT. The ﬁnal four seasons have
been normalized so their seasonal means match the 2004 season.
Middle: The APT observations phased with the orbital period of
17.054 days. A sine ﬁt to the phased observations yields a semi-
amplitude of 0.00041 ± 0.00033 mag. This is consistent with the
absense of light variability on the radial velocity period and also
consistent with planetary reﬂex motion of the star as the cause of
the RV variations. Bottom: The APT observations within ±0.06
phase units of the predicted transit time. The solid curve for the
predicted transit shows the predicted mid-transit at phase 0.0, the
transit depth (0.5%), and the duration (±0.005 phase units) for
a central transit of planet b. The vertical dashed lines represent
the uncertainty in the time of transit. Our photometry shows no
evidence for transits but cannot rule them out completely.

Figure 3. The solid curve for the predicted transit sig-
nature includes the predicted mid-transit at phase 0.0,
the transit depth (0.5%), and transit duration (±0.005
phase units). The vertical dashed lines represent the un-
certainty in our new time of transit. We ﬁnd no evidence
for transits although our data do not rule them out com-
pletely. Monitoring observations were made on the night
of 31 January 2016 UT, during a predicted transit, with
the T12 APT and with the 0.6m telescope at Swarth-
more’s Peter van de Kamp Observatory. The night was
marginally photometric at both sites; again, no evidence
for transits was seen but we are still not able to com-
pletely rule them out.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The presence of stellar activity presents continuing
challenges to exoplanet detection and characterization.
Radial velocity exoplanet survey targets are usually cho-
sen for their low chromospheric activity,
leading to a
bias against activity in the sample of bright planet-host
stars. HD 99491 is an evolved star and has been known
to exhibit chromospheric activity for some time (Zarro
1983; Wright et al. 2004). It is thus quite interesting to

6

Stephen R. Kane et al.

ﬁnd that the companion star, HD 99492, exhibits simi-
lar behavior over long timescales. It is hoped that con-
tinued photometric monitoring will help to resolve the
complete magentic cycle of the star, such as those found
for HD 192263 (Dragomir et al. 2012), although the tar-
get is very diﬃcult to observe due to the small angular
separation of the binary components.

The update to the parameters for the HD 99492 sys-
tem presented here reﬁnes the stellar and planetary or-
bital parameters for the system. The update shows that
the ∼5000 day RV signal is due to stellar activity rather
than a planet. However, there are likely other planets of
smaller mass and/or larger separation that lie beneath
the current noise ﬂoor. As the exploration of exoplane-
tary systems forges onward to ever smaller planets, the
careful examination of stellar activity is becoming more
relevant than ever before.
