PARAMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF UNIVALENT FUNCTIONS

WITH BOUNDARY REGULAR FIXED POINTS

PAVEL GUMENYUK †

Abstract. Given a set S of conformal maps of the unit disk D into itself that is
closed under composition, we address the question whether S can be represented as the
reachable set of a Loewner – Kufarev - type ODE dwt/dt = Gt ◦ wt, w0 = idD, where
the control functions t 7→ Gt form a convex cone MS. For the set of all conformal
ϕ : D → D with ϕ(0) = 0, ϕ′(0) > 0, an aﬃrmative answer to this question is the essence
of Loewner’s well-known Parametric Representation of univalent functions [34]. In this
paper, we study classes of conformal self-maps deﬁned by their boundary regular ﬁxed
points and, in part of the cases, establish their Loewner-type representability.

1. Introduction

For many non-linear problems in Analysis, signiﬁcant advances were achieved by explor-
ing hidden relations with the linear structure. In Geometric Function Theory, one remark-
able example is the parametric representation of conformal maps provided by Loewner
Theory: the class S of all injective maps in A := {f ∈ Hol(D, C) : f (0) = 0, f ′(0) = 1},
D := {z : |z| < 1}, which admits no natural linear structure and even fails to be a
convex set in the ambient vector space A, can be however represented in a constructive
way as a continuous image of a convex cone. This representation is a cornerstone in the
proof [13] of Bieberbach’s famous conjecture. Recently much attention has been attracted
by a stochastic version of the Loewner diﬀerential equation (abbreviated as SLE), intro-
duced in 2000 by Schramm [44]. The Loewner PDE describes the evolution of a conformal
map between a canonical domain and a monotonic (continuously expanding or contract-
ing) family of plane regions. In particular, this allows one to parameterize random Jordan
arcs1 by means of (not necessarily injective) continuous functions on [0, +∞) and there-
fore, describe a family of probability measures over Jordan arcs, arising naturally in many
classical problems, in a quite explicit form as a push-forward of the Wiener measure, see,
e.g., [33].

Both the representation of the class S and SLE involve the so-called Loewner chains,
see, e.g., [15] for more details. In this paper, we use a diﬀerent approach to Loewner’s
representation method. This approach, going back to Loewner himself [34], has been
systematically developed by Goryainov [22 – 28].

Injectivity is a non-linear property, which produces considerable diﬃculty in the study
of univalent functions. At the same time, this property is preserved by composition of
mappings. The class of all univalent (i.e., injective holomorphic) self-maps of the unit
disk D is closed under composition and hence forms a semigroup U. Moreover, endowed
with the usual topology of locally uniform convergence, U becomes a topological semi-
group. Berkson and Porta [6] proved that every one-parameter semigroup (φt)t>0 in U,

i.e. a continuous semigroup homomorphism (cid:0)[0, +∞), · + ·(cid:1) ∋ t 7→ φt ∈ U, is a semiﬂow

deﬁned by the initial value problem

(1.1)

d
dt

φt(z) = G(φt(z)),

t > 0;

φ0(z) = z ∈ D,

where G is a holomorphic function called the (inﬁnitesimal) generator of (φt). The set
TU of all generators, which we will call the inﬁnitesimal structure of the semigroup U, is
a convex cone described by the Berkson – Porta formula [6],

(1.2)

G(z) = (τ − z)(1 − τ z)p(z),

for all z ∈ D,

where τ ∈ D and p ∈ Hol(D, C) with Re p > 0.

1Strictly speaking, random Jordan arcs is one of the possible cases. One can also consider, e.g., self-
touching paths that do not cross themselves. Such paths appear as scale limits of certain discrete stochastic
processes in the plane.

This makes an interesting analogy with Lie groups: TU can be regarded as the analogue
of the tangent space at the origin, with the map U ∋ φ 7→ G ◦ φ playing the role of the
right-invariant vector ﬁeld generated by G ∈ TU. Accordingly, the map

(1.3)

TU ∋ G 7→ φG

1 ∈ U,

where (φG

t ) is the one-parameter semigroup whose generator is G, corresponds in this

It is a classical result of Lie Group Theory, see, e.g., [31, §3.1] that for any (ﬁnite-
dimensional) Lie group G, the Lie exponential map Exp : g → G, where g the Lie algebra
of G, is a diﬀeomorphism of a neighborhood of 0 ∈ g onto a neighborhood of id ∈ G.
Moreover, if G is compact and connected, then Exp(g) = G.

In the semigroup setting, the situation is more complicated. The image of the exponen-
tial map (1.3) is not a subsemigroup and it does not cover a neighborhood of idD in U, see,
e.g., [12, Corollary 3.5 and text below]. This makes impossible to recover the semigroup U
from its inﬁnitesimal structure TU by means of the exponential map (1.3). The same takes
place if we restrict ourselves to the subsemigroup U0 := {ϕ ∈ U : ϕ(0) = 0, ϕ′(0) > 0}.

Loewner [34] realized that it is still possible to recover U0 from TU0 if one considers a
non-autonomous analogue of (1.1) by replacing G with a family 0 6 t 7→ G(·, t) ∈ TU0.
Here TU0 stands for the convex cone formed by all generators G satisfying (φG
t ) ⊂ U0,
namely

TU0 = (cid:8) D ∋ z 7→ −zp(z) : p ∈ Hol(D, C), Re p > 0, Im p(0) = 0 (cid:9)

thanks to (1.2). This leads to the initial value problem

(1.4)

d
dt

ϕs,t(z) = −ϕs,t(z) p(cid:0)ϕs,t(z), t(cid:1),

t > 0;

ϕs,s(z) = z ∈ D,

where G(z, t) := −zp(z, t) belongs to TU0 for a.e. t > 0 and satisﬁes the conditions in
Deﬁnition 2.5.

Equation (1.4) is the classical Loewner – Kufarev ODE, see, e.g., [2] or [40, Chapter 6].
It is known that the union of all non-autonomous semiﬂows (ϕs,t) of (1.4) corresponding
to various choices of p, coincides with U0. This fact is the essence of Loewner’s para-
metric representation of U0. If now we renormalize elements in (ϕs,t), i.e. if we consider
ϕ0,t/ϕ′
0,t(0), and take the limit as t → +∞, we obtain the parametric representation of the
class S, which is usually meant when one refers to Loewner’s parametric representation
of conformal mappings2.

Loewner’s idea can be applied to other semigroups. Goryainov [22, 26] and Goryainov
and Ba [27], see also [3, 4, 8], established parametric representations for several subsemi-
groups S ⊂ U based on reconstruction of a semigroup from its inﬁnitesimal structure
by means of a suitable analogue of the Loewner – Kufarev equation. Moreover, Loewner

2Loewner [34] himself obtained the parametric representation of a dense subclass of S. Later it was

extended to the whole class by Pommerenke [39, 40] and independently by Gutljanski˘ı [29].

himself applied this method to a certain semigroup of matrices [35], see also [14], and to
monotone matrix functions [36, 37]. It is also worth to mention that very similar con-
structions appear in the study of subsemigroups of Lie groups in connection with Control
Theory, see, e.g., [30] and references therein.

However, it does not seem to be known any general idea of how one can determine
whether a given semigroup S can be reconstructed from its inﬁnitesimal structure. For
subsemigroups of Hol(D, D) a necessary condition is univalence: thanks to the uniqueness
of solutions to the initial value problem for the general version of the Loewner – Kufarev
ODE (see equation (2.3) in Sect. 2.2), all the functions ϕs,t are univalent in D. However,
we do not know whether the univalence of all elements of a semigroup S ⊂ Hol(D, D) is
“close” to being a suﬃcient condition.

Therefore, it seems to be reasonable to consider more examples of semigroups in U
and try to answer the question whether they can be reconstructed from their inﬁni-
tesimal structures. In this paper we consider two families of semigroups: Uτ [F ], F :=
{σ1, σ2, . . . , σn} ⊂ ∂D, consisting of all ϕ ∈ U that have boundary regular ﬁxed points
at σj’s, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, see Deﬁnition 2.1, and Uτ [F ], τ ∈ D \ F , consisting of idD and
all ϕ ∈ U[F ] with the Denjoy – Wolﬀ point τ , see Deﬁnition 2.2. We choose these semi-
groups by two main reasons. First of all, there has been an increasing interest in the study
of holomorphic (injective and non-injective) self-maps of D with given boundary regular
ﬁxed points, see, e.g., [45, 46, 18, 38, 42, 16, 5, 19, 20, 26]. Secondly, the inﬁnitesimal
structure of such semigroups is well-studied, see, e.g., [21, 17, 9, 28, 19].

Our main result is as follows, see Deﬁnition 2.6 and Sect. 3 for the precise problem

statement.

Theorem 1. The following semigroups S admit Loewner-type parametric representation:

S := U[F ] with Card(F ) 6 3,
S := Uτ [F ] with τ ∈ ∂D and Card(F ) 6 2, and
S := Uτ [F ] with τ ∈ D and any ﬁnite set F ⊂ ∂D.

The Loewner-type parametric representation for the case S = Uτ [F ] with τ ∈ D and
Card(F ) = 1 goes back to Unkelbach [46], who suggested a kind of discrete version of the
parametric representation for U0[{1}], yet with an important hypothesis left unproved,
and used it to obtain a sharp estimate of ϕ′(1) in terms of ϕ′(0). The Loewner-type
parametric representation for U0[{1}] in the form of a diﬀerential equation, analogous to
the Loewner – Kufarev ODE, was rigorously proved much later by Goryainov [26].

To demonstrate a potential usage of Theorem 1, we obtain the analogue of the Loewner –

Kufarev ODE for U 1[{−1}].

Corollary 1. Let T > 0. The class of all univalent ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D) with the Denjoy – Wolﬀ
point τ = 1 and a boundary regular ﬁxed point σ = −1 of dilation ϕ′(σ) = eT coincides
with the set of all functions representable in the form ϕ(z) = wz(T ) for all z ∈ D, where

Remark 1.1. It follows from [11, Theorem 1.1] and the proof of Corollary 1 that for any
t ∈ [0, T ] the angular derivatives of z 7→ wz(t) at σ = −1 and at τ = 1 equal et and

exp(−R t

0 νs({1}) ds), respectively.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we collect some material from
the theory of holomorphic self-maps of D and modern Loewner Theory necessary for our
purposes. The main problem we address in this paper is stated in Sect. 3, where we also
reformulate it as a problem of embedding in evolution families, see Theorem 2.

In Sect. 4, we present some results on evolution families in U[F ] and Uτ [F ], in particular
Theorem 3, which we believe are closely related to the topic although they are not used
in the proof of the main theorem. Finally, in Sect. 5, we prove Theorem 1 and Corollary 1,
while a question concerning cases not covered by Theorem 1 is raised in Sect. 6.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Regular ﬁxed and contact points. For a function f : D → C by ∠ limz→σ f (z),
where σ ∈ ∂D, we will denote the angular (called also non-tangential) limit of f at σ.
f (z)−f (σ)
If this limit exists, we will denote it, as usual, by f (σ). If, in addition, ∠ limz→σ
exists, ﬁnite or inﬁnite, it is called the angular derivative of f at σ and denoted by f ′(σ).
Note that if f ′(σ) ∈ C, then the limit ∠ limz→σ f ′(z) exists and coincides with f ′(σ), see,
e.g., [41, Proposition 4.7 on p. 79].

z−σ

Below we formulate a version of the classical Julia – Wolﬀ – Charath´eodory Theorem,

see, e.g., [1, Theorem 1.2.5, Proposition 1.2.6, Theorem 1.2.7].

Theorem A (Julia – Wolﬀ – Charath´eodory). Let ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D) and σ ∈ ∂D. Then the
following statements hold:

(i) If ϕ(σ) := ∠ limz→σ ϕ(z) exists and belongs to ∂D, then the angular derivative

ϕ′(σ) := ∠ limz→σ

ϕ(z)−ϕ(σ)

z−σ

exists, ﬁnite or inﬁnite.

6

(ii) The following assertions are equivalent:

(ii.1) the angular limit ϕ(σ) := ∠ limz→σ ϕ(z) exists and belongs to ∂D and the angular

derivative ϕ′(σ) is ﬁnite;

(ii.2) αϕ(σ) := lim inf

z→σ

1 − |ϕ(z)|

1 − |z|

< +∞;

(ii.3) there exists A > 0 and ω ∈ ∂D such that

(2.1)

|ω − ϕ(z)|2
1 − |ϕ(z)|2

6 A

|σ − z|2
1 − |z|2

for all z ∈ D.

(ii) If assertions (ii.1) – (ii.3) take place, then ϕ(σ) = ω and ϕ′(σ) = ω σαϕ(σ) = ω σA0,
where A0 is the minimal value of A for which (2.1) holds. In particular, ω σϕ′(σ) > 0.

Deﬁnition 2.1. If the equivalent conditions (ii.1) – (ii.3) in the above theorem hold, then
the point σ is said to be a regular contact point of the self-map ϕ. If in addition, ϕ(σ) = σ,
then σ is called a boundary regular ﬁxed point (abbreviated as BRFP) of ϕ.

By the classical Denjoy – Wolﬀ Theorem (see, e.g., [1, Theorem 1.2.14, Corollary 1.2.16,
Theorem 1.3.9]), for any ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D) \ {idD} there exists a unique τ ∈ D with the
following property: τ is either internal ﬁxed point of ϕ, i.e. τ ∈ D and ϕ(τ ) = τ , or τ
is a boundary regular ﬁxed point of ϕ with ϕ′(τ ) 6 1. Moreover, if ϕ is not an elliptic
automorphism, then the iterates ϕ◦n → τ locally uniformly in D as n → +∞.

Deﬁnition 2.2. In the above notation, τ is called the Denjoy – Wolﬀ point (in short,
DW-point) of ϕ.

Remark 2.3. With the help of conformal mapping, Theorem A can be applied to self-
maps of the right half-plane H := {ζ : Re ζ > 0}. In this way, for any f ∈ Hol(H, H)
inequality (2.1) leads to

Re f (z) > f ′(∞) Re z

(2.2)
where f ′(∞) := ∠ limz→∞ f (z)/z exists ﬁnitely, with f ′(∞) > 0. Thanks to the Maximum
Principle applied to the harmonic function z 7→ Re f (z) − f ′(∞) Re z, if equality holds
in (2.2) at some point z ∈ H, then it holds for all z ∈ H.

for all z ∈ H,

Remark 2.4. It is known, see, e.g., [18, p. 275], that if σ1 and σ2 are BRFP’s of a self-
map ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D), then ϕ′(σ1) ϕ′(σ2) > 0, with strict inequality sign unless ϕ is an
automorphism.

2.2. Parametric Representation and evolution families in the disk. A general
form of the non-autonomous analogue of equation (1.1), suitable for our purpose, was
suggested by Bracci, Contreras and D´ıaz-Madrigal in their seminal paper [10]. The role of
inﬁnitesimal generators in their equation is played by the so-called Herglotz vector ﬁelds.

PARAMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF UNIVALENT FUNCTIONS WITH BRFPS

7

Deﬁnition 2.5 ([10]). A function G : D × [0, +∞) → C is called a Herglotz vector ﬁeld
(in the unit disk) if it satisﬁes the following conditions:
HVF1. for every z ∈ D, the function [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ G(z, t) is measurable;
HVF2. for a.e. t ∈ [0, +∞), the function D ∋ z 7→ Gt(z) := G(z, t) is an inﬁnitesimal

generator, i.e. Gt ∈ TU;

HVF3. for any compact set K ⊂ D and any T > 0 there exists a non-negative locally
integrable function kK,T on [0, +∞) such that |G(z, t)| 6 kK,T (t) for all z ∈ K and
a.e. t ∈ [0, T ].

It is known [10, Theorem 4.4] that every Herglotz vector ﬁeld G is semicomplete, i.e.

for any z ∈ D and any s > 0 the initial value problem

(2.3)

d
dt

ϕs,t(z) = G(cid:0)ϕs,t(z), t(cid:1), ϕs,s(z) = z,

has a unique solution t 7→ ϕs,t(z) deﬁned for all t > s.

Thanks to the Berkson – Porta formula (1.2), any Herglotz vector ﬁeld G can be ex-

pressed in the form G(z, t) = (cid:0)τ (t) − z(cid:1)(cid:0)1 − τ (t)z(cid:1) p(z, t), where τ : [0, +∞) → D and

Re p > 0. In this way, Herglotz vector ﬁelds can be characterized via the Berkson – Porta
data (p, τ ), see [10, Theorem 4.8]. In particular, if we set τ ≡ 0 and p(0, ·) ≡ 1, then
assuming that p(z, ·) is measurable for each z ∈ D, from equation (2.3) we obtain the
classical Loewner – Kufarev ODE (1.4). It is known that the union of all semiﬂows, i.e.
the reachable set of (1.4), coincides with the class U0 of all univalent ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D) with
ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ′(0) > 0.

The latter statement is (one of essentially equivalent) formulation of Loewner’s much
celebrated Parametric Representation of univalent functions due to Loewner [34], Ku-
farev [32], Pommerenke [39], [40, Chapter 6], and Gutljanski [29]. Note that U is a semi-
group w.r.t. the composition operation (ψ, ϕ) 7→ ψ ◦ ϕ. A natural question arises: given a
subsemigroup S ⊂ Hol(D, D), is it possible to represent S using the same idea, i.e. as the
reachable set of a suitable special case of (2.3)? More precisely, we introduce the following
deﬁnition.

t ) ⊂ S.

For S ⊂ Hol(D, D) we denote by TS, further on referred to as the inﬁnitesimal structure
of S, the set of all inﬁnitesimal generators G giving rise, via equation (1.1), to one-
parameter semigroups (φG
Deﬁnition 2.6. We say that a subsemigroup S ⊂ Hol(D, D) admits Loewner-type para-
metric representation if there exists a convex cone MS of Herglotz vector ﬁelds in D with
the following properties:
LPR1. for every G ∈ MS, we have G(·, t) ∈ TS for a.e. t > 0;
LPR2. for every G ∈ MS, the solution ϕs,t to the initial value problem (2.3) satisﬁes

ϕs,t ∈ S for any s > 0 and any t > s;

LPR3. for every ϕ ∈ S there exists G ∈ MS such that ϕ = ϕs,t for some s > 0 and t > s,

where ϕs,t stands, as above, for the solution to (2.3).

8

P. GUMENYUK

The main results of [10] says that similarly to the theory of one-parameter semigroups,
the semiﬂows of (2.3) can be characterized in an intrinsic way without appealing to
diﬀerential equations. This is fact will play a very important role in our argument.

Deﬁnition 2.7 ([10]). A family (ϕs,t)0≤s≤t of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disk is
called an evolution family if it satisﬁes the following conditions:
EF1. ϕs,s = idD for any s > 0;
EF2. ϕs,t = ϕu,t ◦ ϕs,u whenever 0 ≤ s ≤ u ≤ t;
EF3. for all z ∈ D and T > 0 there exists an integrable function kz,T : [0, T ] → [0, +∞)

such that

|ϕs,u(z) − ϕs,t(z)| ≤ Z t

u

kz,T (ξ) dξ

whenever 0 ≤ s ≤ u ≤ t ≤ T.

Remark 2.8. Although it is not required in the above deﬁnition, all elements of an evolu-
tion family are univalent in D, see [10, Corollary 6.3].

In [10, Theorem 1.1] it is proved that for any Herglotz vector ﬁeld G the solution (ϕs,t)
to (2.3) is an evolution family and, conversely, any evolution family (ϕs,t) satisﬁes (2.3)
with some Herglotz vector ﬁeld G. This correspondence is one-to-one if we identify Her-
glotz vector ﬁelds G(·, t) that coincide for a.e. t > 0.

Deﬁnition 2.9. In the above notation, the Herglotz vector ﬁeld G and the corresponding
evolution family (ϕs,t) are said to be associated with each other.

In the next section we will introduce the semigroups S which we are going to study in
this paper. Further, using the above 1-to-1 correspondence, we will reformulate the prob-
lem of Loewner-type representation for these semigroups as a problem of embeddability
in evolution families.

In conclusion of this section, let us remark that condition LPR2 in Deﬁnition 2.6 does
not follow from LPR1. Indeed, consider the semigroup U[{1}] of all univalent self-maps
ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D) having a BRFP at σ = 1. Then in view of [17, Theorem 1], the Herglotz vec-
tor ﬁelds deﬁned in [11, Examples 6.7 and 6.8] satisfy condition LPR1, but the associated
evolution families are not contained in U[{1}].

It seems plausible to conjecture that LPR2 implies LPR1, but this interesting question

goes slightly out of the framework of the present paper.

We conclude this section with one standard (but not so well-known in this form) result

from the classical Loewner Theory, see, e.g., [40, Problem 3 on p. 164] or [2, pp. 69-70].

Theorem B. Let ψ ∈ Hol(D, D) \ {idD} be a univalent function with ψ(0) = 0 and
ψ′(0) > 0. Then there exists an evolution family (ϕs,t) such that ϕ0,1 = ψ and ϕs,t(0) = 0,
s,t(0) = exp(cid:0)(t − s) log ψ′(0)(cid:1) whenever t > s > 0.

3. Problem statement and its reformulation via evolution families

For a ﬁnite set F ⊂ ∂D we denote by P[F ] the class of all self-maps ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D) for
which every σ ∈ F is a BRFP. Further, for τ ∈ D \ F we denote by Pτ [F ] the subclass
of P[F ] that consists of the identity map idD and all ϕ ∈ P[F ] \ {idD} whose DW-point
coincides with τ . Finally, by U[F ] and Uτ [F ] we denote the classes formed by all univalent
self-maps from P[F ] and Pτ [F ], respectively. Note that these classes are semigroups with
identity w.r.t. the operation of composition.

The main problem we address in this paper is the following.

Problem: do the semigroups U[F ] and Uτ [F ] admit Loewner-type parametric represen-
tation in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.6?

We are able to give an aﬃrmative answer for a part of the cases, see Theorem 1 in the
Introduction. The ﬁrst step is to reduce the above problem to a problem of embeddability
in evolution families.

Theorem 2. Let S := U[F ] or S := Uτ [F ] with some ﬁnite set F ⊂ ∂D and τ ∈ D \ F .
Then the following conditions are equivalent:

(i) S admits Loewner-type parametric representation;
(ii) for any ϕ ∈ S\{idD} there exists an evolution family (ψs,t) ⊂ S such that ϕ = ψ0,1.

Proof of Theorem 2. Note that (i) implies (ii) for any semigroup S. Indeed, assume
that (i) holds. Then by Deﬁnition 2.6, for any ϕ ∈ S \ {idD} there exists a Herglotz vector
ﬁeld G with associated evolution family (ϕs,t) ⊂ S such that ϕ = ϕs0,t0 for some s0 > 0
and t0 > s0. Setting ψs,t := ϕs0+qs,s0+qt, q := t0 − s0, for all s > 0 and all t > s proves (ii).
Now we assume that (ii) holds. Consider ﬁrst the case S = U[F ]. To show that (i) holds,

deﬁne MS to be the set of all Herglotz vector ﬁelds G with the following properties:

(a) for each σ ∈ F and a.e. t > 0 there exists a ﬁnite angular limit λσ(t) :=

∠ limz→σ G(z, t)/(z − σ);

(b) the functions λσ, σ ∈ F , are locally integrable on [0, +∞).

Then thanks to the fact that the set of all inﬁnitesimal generators is a convex cone,
see, e.g., [1, Theorem 1.4.15], the set MS is also a convex cone. Moreover, according
to [17, Theorem 1] and [11, Theorem 1.1], MS satisﬁes conditions LPR1 and LPR2 in
Deﬁnition 2.6.

Now let ϕ ∈ U[F ]. Then by (ii) there exists an evolution family (ψs,t) ⊂ U[F ] such that
ψ0,1 = ϕ. By [11, Theorem 1.1], the vector ﬁeld G associated with (ψs,t) satisﬁes conditions
(a) and (b). This proves LPR3.

It remains to explain how the proof of (ii) ⇒ (i) should be modiﬁed in the case S = Uτ [F ].

First of all, to conditions (a) and (b) we should add condition

(c) G(z, t) = (τ −z)(1−τ z)p(z, t) for all z ∈ D, a.e. t > 0 and some p : D×[0, +∞) → C

with Re p > 0.

To make sure that LPR1 and LPR2 hold we should additionally use [1, Theorem 1.4.19]
and [10, Corollary 7.2], respectively. Finally, to see that the vector ﬁeld G associated
with (ψs,t) satisﬁes condition (c), one should additionally use [10, Theorem 6.7].

The proof is now complete.

4. Evolution families with boundary regular fixed points

In this section we study conditions under which a family (ϕs,t)t>s>0 ⊂ S, where
S := P[F ] or S := Pτ [F ], satisfying conditions EF1 and EF2 from Deﬁnition 2.7, is
an evolution family.

Remark 4.1. In the above notation, by the Chain Rule for angular derivatives (see, e.g.,
[17, Lemma 2]) for any σ ∈ F (and also for σ := τ in case S = Pτ [F ]) we have ϕ′
s,t(σ) =
ϕ′

u,t(σ) whenever t > u > s > 0.

s,u(σ)ϕ′

Theorem 3. Let τ ∈ D, σ ∈ ∂D \ {τ } and let (ϕs,t)t>s>0 be a family in Pτ [{σ}] satisfy-
ing conditions EF1 and EF2 from Deﬁnition 2.7. Then the following two assertions are
equivalent:

(i) (ϕs,t) is an evolution family;
(ii) the function [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ ϕ′

0,t(σ) ∈ (0, +∞) is locally absolutely continuous.

Proof. The fact that (i) implies (ii) follows readily from [11, Theorem 1.1]. The converse
implication for τ ∈ D is proved in [24], but we sketch here a bit diﬀerent version of that
proof. First of all, using automorphisms of D we may assume that τ = 0. Then applying
Theorem A for ϕ(z) := ϕu,v(z)/z with v > u > 0 and using Remark 4.1, it is easy to
see that (ii) implies that [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ ϕ′
0,t(0) ∈ C is also locally absolutely continuous
and that ϕ′
0,t(0) 6= 0 for all t > 0. Therefore, (i) follows from [10, Theorem 7.3] (or,
equivalently, from [15, Proposition 2.10]).

Now assume that (ii) holds and that τ ∈ ∂D. Using the fact that ϕ′
s,t(τ )ϕ′

s,t(τ ) 6 1 but
s,t(σ) > 1 for all s > 0 and t > s by Remark 2.4, and bearing in mind Remark 4.1,
0,t(τ ) ∈ (0, +∞) is locally absolutely continuous. The rest of
(cid:3)

ϕ′
we see that [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ ϕ′
the proof is reduced to the proposition below.

Proposition 1. Let σ1, σ2 be two distinct points of ∂D and let (ϕs,t)t>s>0 be a family
in P[{σ1, σ2}] satisfying conditions EF1 and EF2 from Deﬁnition 2.7. Then the following
two assertions are equivalent:

(i) (ϕs,t) is an evolution family;
(ii) the functions [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ ϕ′

continuous.

0,t(σj) ∈ (0, +∞), j = 1, 2, are locally absolutely

Proof. As before, the implication (i) =⇒ (ii) is by [11, Theorem 1.1].

So let us assume (ii) and prove (i). Let H be any conformal map of D onto the right
half-plane H with H(σ1) = ∞, H(σ2) = 0. Fix any T > 0. For all u, t ∈ [0, T ] with u 6 t

we deﬁne gu,t(ζ) := H(ϕu,t(ζ)) − H(ζ)/ϕ′
either gu,t ≡ i C for some constant C ∈ R or gu,t ∈ Hol(D, H) and hence fu,t(w) :=

1/gu,t(cid:0)H −1(1/w)) is a holomorphic self-map of H. Since σ2 is a BRFP of ϕu,t, in the

former case we get gu,t ≡ 0, while in the latter case we have

In view of Remark 4.1, it follows that for any K ⊂⊂ D there exists MK > 0 such that

Now ﬁx any z ∈ D. By (ii) and Remark 4.1,

sup{ϕ′

Hence, using Theorem A for ϕs,u twice, at σ1 and at σ2, we conclude that

K(z) := {ϕs,u(z) : 0 6 s 6 u 6 T } ⊂⊂ D.

Applying now (4.1) with K := K(z) and ζ := ϕs,u(z), where 0 6 s 6 u 6 T , we get

Remark 4.2. Fix some z0 ∈ D. Using Theorem A it is not diﬃcult to show that asser-
tion (ii) in Proposition 1 is equivalent to:
(iii) [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ ϕ′

0,t(σ2) and [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ ϕ0,t(z0) are locally absolutely

It turns out that in case of more than two boundary regular ﬁxed points even the

regularity requirement concerning t 7→ ϕ0,t(z0) may be omitted.

Proposition 2. Let F := {σ1, σ2, . . . σn} ⊂ ∂D, where σj’s are pairwise distinct points
and n > 3. Let (ϕs,t)t>s>0 be a family in P[F ] satisfying conditions EF1 and EF2 from
Deﬁnition 2.7. Then the following two assertions are equivalent:

(i) (ϕs,t) is an evolution family;

j=1 ϕ′

0,t(σj) ∈ (0, +∞) is locally absolutely continuous.

(ii) the function [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ Qn
For j = 1, . . . , n and t > 0 denote λj(t) := log ϕ0,t(σj) and λ(t) := Pn

Proof. Again, in view of [11, Theorem 1.1], we only need to prove that (ii) implies (i).
j=1 λj(t). Fix now
any s > 0 and any t > s. Trivially, λj(t) − λj(s) = 0 for all j = 1, . . . , n if ϕs,t = idD. So
suppose that ϕs,t 6= idD and consider the following two cases.
Case 1: The Denjoy – Wolﬀ point of ϕs,t does not belong to F .
Then, in view of Remark 4.1,

λj(t) − λj(s) > 0 and hence 0 < λj(t) − λj(s) < λ(t) − λ(s) for all j = 1, . . . , n.

Case 2: One of the points σ1, . . . , σn is the Denjoy – Wolﬀ point of ϕs,t.
Without loss of generality we may assume that this point is σ1. Fix any natural numbers
j ∈ [2, n] and k ∈ [2, n] \ {j}. Recall that ϕ′
s,t(σ1) > 0 by Remark 2.4. Therefore,
again we have 0 < λj(t) − λj(s) < λ(t) − λ(s) for all j = 2, . . . , n. It follows, in addition,
that

s,t(σk)ϕ′

0 > λ1(t) − λ1(s) = λ(t) − λ(s) −

n

Xj=2 (cid:0)λj(t) − λj(s)(cid:1) > −(n − 2)(λ(t) − λ(s)).

Thus if (ii) holds, then all λj’s are locally absolutely continuous on [0, +∞). By Propo-
sition 1 the latter implies that (ϕs,t) is an evolution family, which was to be proved. (cid:3)

5. Proof of the main results

Throughout this section we will assume that τ, σ1, σ2, . . . , σn are pairwise distinct points,

τ ∈ D and F := {σ1, σ2, . . . , σn} ⊂ ∂D.

5.1. Lemmas. First of all we prove a version of the Chain Rule for ﬁnite angular deriva-
tives.

Lemma 5.1. Let ψ1, ψ2 ∈ Hol(D, D). If σ ∈ ∂D is a regular contact point of ψ2 ◦ ψ1, then
σ is also a regular contact point of ψ1 and ψ1(σ) is a regular contact point of ψ2, with
(ψ2 ◦ ψ1)′(σ) = ψ′

2(ψ1(σ))ψ′

1(σ).

Proof. According to Theorem A, there exists a sequence (zn) ⊂ D converging to σ such
that

lim inf
n→+∞

1 − |ψ2(ψ1(zn))|

1 − |zn|

< +∞.

PARAMETRIC REPRESENTATION OF UNIVALENT FUNCTIONS WITH BRFPS

13

Passing to a subsequence, we may assume that (cid:0)ψ1(zn)(cid:1) also converges. It is easy to see

that ω := limn→+∞ ψ1(zn) ∈ ∂D. Taking into account that by Theorem A, both αψ1(σ)
and αψ2(ω) are diﬀerent from zero, we therefore conclude that

lim inf
n→+∞

1 − |ψ1(zn)|

1 − |zn|

lim inf
n→+∞

1 − |ψ2(ψ1(zn))|

1 − |ψ1(zn)|

6 lim inf
n→+∞

1 − |ψ2(ψ1(zn))|

1 − |zn|

< +∞

and hence αψ1(σ) and αψ2(ω) are ﬁnite. Thus σ and ω are regular contact points of ψ1
and ψ2, respectively, while the formula for (ψ2 ◦ ψ1)′(σ) holds by Remark 4.1.
(cid:3)

The following lemma is a slight extension of Theorem B.

Lemma 5.2. For any univalent φ ∈ Hol(D, D) \ M¨ob(D) there exists an evolution family
(ϕs,t) such that φ = ϕ0,1. Moreover, ϕs,t 6∈ M¨ob(D) whenever t > s > 0.

Proof. Denote

h(z) :=

|φ′(0)|
φ′(0)

z − φ(0)

1 − zφ(0)

for all z ∈ D.

Then ˜φ := h ◦ φ ∈ Hol(D, D) satisﬁes ˜φ(0) = 0 and ˜φ′(0) > 0 and hence by Theorem B
there exists an evolution family ( ˜ϕs,t) such that ˜ϕ0,1 = ˜φ. Since h ∈ M¨ob(D), there exists
a one-parameter group (ht)t∈R ⊂ M¨ob(D) such that h1 = h. Thus, according to [15,
Lemma 2.8], the functions ϕs,t := h−1
t ◦ ˜ϕs,t ◦ hs form an evolution family, with ϕ0,1 = φ
by the very construction. Since all ˜ϕs,t’s with s 6= t are in Hol(D, D) \ M¨ob(D), the same
property holds for ϕs,t’s, and the proof is ﬁnished.
(cid:3)

In the most simple cases, the above lemma is enough for our purposes, while in other
cases a bit deeper analysis is needed. Denote by R(D, w0) the conformal radius of a simply
connected domain D ⊂ C w.r.t. w0.

Lemma 5.3. Let D1 ⊂ D2, D′
that D1 ⊂ D′
1 and D2 \ D1 = D′

2 be four hyperbolic simply connected domains such
1. Then for any w0 ∈ D1 we have

(5.1)

1 ⊂ D′
2 \ D′
R(D2, w0)
R(D1, w0)

6

R(D′
R(D′

2, w0)
1, w0)

and the equality holds if only if D1 = D2.

Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that w0 = 0. Denote by K1 and K2 the
images of C \ D2 and C \ D′
1, respectively, under the inversion z 7→ 1/z. The hypothesis
of the lemma implies that D2 ∩ D′
2. Therefore, inequality (5.1) is
equivalent to the following analogue of strong subadditivity for the logarithmic capacity:

1 = D1 and D2 ∪ D′

1 = D′

cap(K1 ∪ K2) cap(K1 ∩ K2) 6 cap(K1) cap(K2),

which was proved in [43].

(cid:3)

14

P. GUMENYUK

Remark 5.4. Inequality (5.1) leads to a conclusion, which seems to be paradoxical at the
ﬁrst glance: adding the same “piece” D2 \ D1 to a larger domain D′
1 results in larger
relative change of the conformal radius.

To simplify the statement of the next lemma let us setup some notation. First of all we
will assume that the points σj’s are numbered in such a way that the open arc Lj ⊂ ∂D
going in the counter-clockwise direction from σj to σj+1, where for convenience we put
σn+1 := σ1, does not contain other points from F . Now let φ ∈ P[F ] and f ∈ Hol(D, D)
be both univalent, with f (D) ⊃ φ(D). Then for each j = 1, . . . , n there exists a unique
regular contact point ξj of f such that f (ξj) = σj, see, e.g., [41, Theorem 4.14 on p. 83].
We denote this point by f −1(σj). Further on, we use the lower index, e.g., a1 or b3, to
denote the components of vectors a, a′, b, b′, x ∈ [0, 1]n.

Lemma 5.5. Let φ ∈ U[F ], n > 1, and z0 ∈ D. Suppose that there exists no j ∈ [1, n] ∩ N
such that φ extends continuously to Lj with φ(Lj) ⊂ ∂D. Then there exists a fam-
ily (fa)a∈[0,1]n of univalent holomorphic self-maps of D satisfying the following conditions:

a(z0)φ′(z0) > 0 for all a ∈ [0, 1]n;

(i) fa(z0) = φ(z0) and f ′
(ii) f(0,...,0) = φ and f(1,...,1) ∈ M¨ob(D);
(iii) if a, b ∈ [0, 1]n, a 6= b and aj 6 bj for all j = 1, . . . , n, then fa(D)   fb(D);
(iv) if k ∈ [1, n]∩N and if a, b ∈ [0, 1]n with ak 6 bk and aj = bj for all j ∈ ([1, n]\{k})∩N,
then ϕa,b := f −1
◦ fa extends continuously to ∂D \ Ck(a), with ϕa,b(∂D \ Ck(a)) =
∂D \ Ck(b), where Ck(x), x ∈ [0, 1]n, is the closed arc of ∂D going counter-clockwise
from f −1

x (σk) to f −1

x (σk+1);

j=1[0, σj). For each j = 1, . . . , n denote by ∆j the Jordan domain bounded by
Lj ∪[0, σj]∪[0, σj+1] and by Ωj the Jordan domain bounded by Lj ∪φ([0, σj])∪φ([0, σj+1]).
Then ∆j’s are connected components of D \ Γ, ϕ(∆j)’s are connected components of
ϕ(D) \ ϕ(Γ), and Ωj’s are connected components of D \ φ(Γ). Therefore,

D = φ(Γ) ∪

Indeed, D = φ(D) ∪ Sn

Fix any k ∈ [1, n] ∩ N. By (A) the set

Uk := φ(Γ) ∪ φ(∆k) ∪ [j=1,...,n

Ωj

j6=k

is a simply connected domain containing φ(∆). Let φk be any conformal mapping of D
onto Uk. Form the hypothesis of the lemma it follows with the help of the Carath´eodory
Extension Theorem that φ(∆k) 6= Ωk and hence Uk 6= D. Then by Lemma 5.2 there exists
an evolution family (ϕk
0,1 = φk and ϕs,t 6∈ M¨ob(D) whenever t > s > 0. The
family of domains Uk(s) := ϕk

s,1(D), s ∈ [0, 1], has the following properties:

s,t) such that ϕk

(B) Uk(0) = Uk and Uk(1) = D;

(C) Uk(s)   Uk(t) whenever 0 6 s < t 6 1;

(D) [0, 1] ∋ s 7→ R(Uk(s), φ(z0)) is continuous and strictly increasing.

In particular, there exists an increasing injective function sk : [0, 1] → [0, 1] such that

[0, 1] ∋ ν 7→ log R(cid:0)Uk(sk(ν)), 0(cid:1) is a (non-homogeneous) linear function. Now we deﬁne

Ga :=

Uj(sj(aj)) = φ(Γ) ∪

[j=1

Uj(sj(aj)) ∩ Ωj

for all a ∈ [0, 1]n.

For each j = 1, . . . , n and all s ∈ [0, 1], Ωj is a Jordan domain and Uj(s) ∩ ∂Ωj =
φ([0, σj) ∪ [0, σj+1)) is a cross-cut in Uj(s) thanks to (B) and (C). Hence Uj(s) ∩ Ωj ⊃
φ(∆j) is a simply connected domain. Then by (A), for all a ∈ [0, 1]n, Ga is a simply
connected domain containing φ(D). Therefore, for each a ∈ [0, 1]n there exists a unique
conformal mapping fa of D onto Ga normalized by fa(0) = φ(0), f ′
a(0)φ′(0) > 0. Clearly,
the family (fa) deﬁned in this way satisﬁes conditions (i) – (iii).
To prove (iv) we note ﬁrst that for any x ∈ [0, 1]n, the arc Jk := φ(cid:0)[0, σk)∪[0, σk+1)(cid:1) is a

cross-cut in Gx. On the one hand, the two connected components of Gx\Jk are Gx∩Ωk and
Gx \ Ωk. On the other hand, the preimages of these components under fx are the Jordan
k (x) ⊂ D bounded by f −1
domains W ′

f −1
x (Jk)∪{f −1
x (σk+1)}∪(cid:0)∂D\Ck(x)(cid:1), respectively, see, e.g., [41, §2.4]. Moreover, if
a and b are such as in (iii), then by construction, Ga\Ωk = Gb\Ωk and hence ϕa,b(W ′′

It remains to prove (v). Note ﬁrst that for each k ∈ [0, n] ∩ N, by construction the

function V (a) := log R(Ga, 0) is linear w.r.t. ak on the set

(cid:8)a ∈ [0, 1]n : aj = 1 for all j = 1, . . . , n except for j = k(cid:9).

Suppose now that a, b ∈ [0, 1]n, aj = bj for all j = 1, . . . , n except for j = k, and ak 6 bk.
Deﬁne a′, b′ ∈ [1, n]n by setting a′
k := bk, and aj := bj := 1 for all j = 1, . . . , n
except for j = k. Then by construction, Ga ⊂ Gb, Ga′ ⊂ Gb′, Ga ⊂ Ga′ and Gb \ Ga =
Gb′ \ Ga′. Therefore, by Lemma 5.3, 0 6 V (b) − V (a) 6 V (b′) − V (a′). Thus, V is Lipschitz

We will make use of the following classical result, known as Loewner’s Lemma.

Theorem C (Loewner [34, Hilfssatz I]). If ϕ ∈ Hol(D, D), ϕ(0) = 0, extends continuously
to an open arc L ⊂ ∂D and ϕ(L) ⊂ ∂D, then |L| 6 |ϕ(L)|, where | · | stands for the length
of an arc. The equality holds only if ϕ ∈ M¨ob(D).

The statement below can be called a “boundary three-point version of Loewner’s

Lemma”.

Lemma 5.6. Let f ∈ Hol(D, D) be a univalent function with three pairwise distinct BRFPs
σ1, σ2, τ ∈ ∂D. The following statements hold:

(i) Suppose that f extends continuously to the open arc L ⊂ ∂D between σ1 and σ2 that
contains τ , with f (L) ⊂ ∂D. Then f ′(τ ) 6 1, with f ′(τ ) = 1 if and only if f = idD.
(ii) Suppose that f extends continuously to the open arc L′ := ∂D \ L, with f (L′) ⊂ ∂D.

Then f ′(τ ) > 1, with f ′(τ ) = 1 if and only if f = idD.

Proof of (i). Consider Φ := Hτ ◦ f ◦ H −1
, where Hτ (ζ) := i(τ + ζ)/(τ − ζ) maps D
conformally onto Hi := {z : Im z > 0} with Hτ (τ ) = ∞. Let ξ1 < ξ2 be the images of σ1
and σ2 w.r.t. Hτ . According to the Schwarz Reﬂection Principle, Φ extends to a univalent
meromorphic function on C \ [ξ1, ξ2] with a unique pole located at ∞. In particular, it
follows that ∞, ξ1, ξ2 6∈ Φ(R \ [ξ1, ξ2]) and that Φ′(x) > 0 for any x ∈ R \ [ξ1, ξ2].

τ

Therefore, Φ(x2)−Φ(x1) > ξ2 −ξ1 for all x1 < ξ1 and x2 > ξ2. Now write the Nevanlinna

Representation Formula for Φ, see, e.g., [7, p. 135–142]:

(5.2)

Φ(z) = α + βz +Z ξ2

ξ1

1 + tz
t − z

dν(t)

for all z ∈ Hi,

where α ∈ R, β := 1/f ′(τ ) > 0 and ν is a ﬁnite positive Borel measure on [ξ1, ξ2]. By the
uniqueness of the holomorphic extension, (5.2) holds also for all z ∈ C \ [ξ1, ξ2]. Hence for
all x1 < ξ1 and x2 > ξ2 we have

Φ(x2) − Φ(x1) = (x2 − x1)hβ − Z ξ2

ξ1

1 + t2

(x2 − t)(t − x1)

dν(t)i > ξ2 − ξ1.

It follows that necessarily β > 1, with β = 1 only if ν([ξ1, ξ2]) = 0. Thus, f ′(τ ) 6 1 and
the equality f ′(τ ) = 1 holds only if f ∈ M¨ob(D). Recalling that, by the condition, f ﬁxes
three points on ∂D completes the proof of (i).
Proof of (ii). Arguing in a similar way as in the proof of (i), we see that Φ extends
holomorphically through (ξ1, ξ2) to the lower half-plane and that 0 < Φ(x2) − Φ(x1) <

form

Φ(z) = α + βz + Z

1 + tz
t − z

dν(t)

R\(ξ1,ξ2)

for all z ∈ C \(cid:0)R \ (ξ1, ξ2)(cid:1),

where α ∈ R, β := 1/f ′(τ ) > 0 and ν is a ﬁnite positive Borel measure on R \ (ξ1, ξ2).
Thus from

Φ(x2) − Φ(x1) = (x2 − x1)hβ + Z

R\(ξ1,ξ2)

1 + t2

(x2 − t)(x1 − t)

dν(t)i < ξ2 − ξ1

for all x1 ∈ (ξ1, ξ2) and all x2 ∈ (x1, ξ2) it follows that β 6 1 and that β = 1 if and only
if ν(R \ (ξ1, ξ2)) = 0, which ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.7. In the proof of Theorem 1 we will deal with monotonic functions on [0, 1]n.
Note that if a function µ : [0, 1]n → R is monotonic and continuous separately in each
variable, then it is (jointly) continuous. Indeed, to ﬁx the idea assume that µ is increasing
in each variable. Using “’variable-wise” continuity, for any given a ∈ (0, 1)n and ε > 0 one
can ﬁnd δ ∈ (0, +∞)n such that a ± δ ∈ [0, 1]n and |µ(a ± δ) − µ(a)| < ε. Then by the
monotonicity, µ(a) − ε < µ(a − δ) 6 µ(b) 6 µ(a + δ) < µ(a) + ε whenever |bj − aj| 6 δj
for all j = 1, . . . , n. A similar argument applies to boundary points of [0, 1]n.

5.2. Proof of Theorem 1. According to Theorem 2, it is suﬃcient to show that for any
φ ∈ S \ {idD} there exists an evolution family (ψs,t) such that ψ0,1 = φ and ψs,t ∈ S
whenever 0 6 s 6 t 6 1.

If φ ∈ M¨ob(D), then φ = φ1 for some one-parameter semigroup (φt) ⊂ M¨ob(D) having
the same BRFPs and the DW-point as φ does. In such a case, the functions ψs,t := φt−s
form the desired evolution family.

Therefore, we suppose that φ 6∈ M¨ob(D). Let us ﬁrst consider the case, which appears

to be the simplest.

CASE (a): S = U[F ] with n 6 3
By Lemma 5.2 there exists an evolution family (ϕs,t) such that ϕ0,1 = φ. Then by EF2,
φ = ϕu,1 ◦ ϕ0,u for all u ∈ [0, 1]. Hence by Lemma 5.1, σj’s are regular contact points
of ϕ0,u for all u ∈ [0, 1]. Using [11, Theorem 3.5] we see that [0, 1] ∋ u 7→ ϕ0,u(σj)
is absolutely continuous for each j = 1, . . . , n. Moreover, for all u ∈ [0, 1], the points
ϕ0,u(σj) are pairwise distinct because ϕ0,u is univalent in D and conformal at each σj (in
the sense of [41, §4.3]). Recall that n 6 3 by our assumption. Note also that ϕ0,1(σj) =
φ(σj) = σj for all j’s. Therefore, it is easy to construct a family (gu)u∈[0,1] ⊂ M¨ob(D)
such that: (i) gu(ϕ0,u(σj)) = σj for each j = 1, . . . , n; (ii) g1 = idD; (iii) the functions
[0, 1] ∋ u 7→ gu(0) and [0, 1] ∋ u 7→ g′
u(0) are absolutely continuous. For all t > 1 we set
gt := idD. Finally, deﬁne ψs,t := gt ◦ ϕs,t ◦ g−1
for all s > 0 and all t > s. Then by [15,

s

18

P. GUMENYUK

Lemma 2.8], (ψs,t) is an evolution family. Moreover, by construction ψ0,1 = φ and ψs,t ∈ S
whenever 0 6 s 6 t 6 1. Thus for case (a) the proof is complete.

CASE (b): S = Uτ [F ] with τ ∈ ∂D and Card(F ) 6 2

If n = 1, then the proof is essentially the same as in Case (a). We only have to replace
the conditions upon the family (gu) by the following:

(i) gu(ϕ0,u(σ1)) = σ1 and gu(ϕ0,u(τ )) = τ for all u ∈ [0, 1];
(ii) g′

u(ϕ0,u(τ )) = (cid:0)1 + u(φ′(τ ) − 1)(cid:1)/ϕ′
0,u(τ ) are absolutely continuous.

and notice that by [11, Theorem 3.5] also the functions [0, 1] ∋ u 7→ ϕ′
u 7→ ϕ′

0,u(τ ) for all u ∈ [0, 1],

0, L′

1 and L′

0,u(σ1) and [0, 1] ∋

So let us assume that n = 2. Denote by L′

2 the pairwise disjoint open arcs
of ∂D contained between σ1 and σ2, σ1 and τ , σ2 and τ , respectively. Denote by J the set
of indices j = 0, 1, 2 for which φ can be extended continuously to L′
j) ⊂ ∂D.
Note that φ′(τ ) 6 1 and φ 6= idD. Hence, by Lemma 5.6(ii), J 6∋ 0. First we assume that
J = {1, 2}. Then apply Case (a) with {σ1, σ2, τ } substituted for F . The functions ψs,t,
0 6 s 6 t 6 1, satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 5.6(i). Thus ψ′
s,t(τ ) 6 1, which means
that ψs,t ∈ Uτ [{σ1, σ2}] whenever 0 6 s 6 t 6 1.

j with φ(L′

1 ∪ {τ } ∪ L′

Now we assume that {1, 2} 6⊂ J. Swapping σ1 and σ2 if necessary, we have L1 = L′

0 and
L2 = L′
2. Therefore, φ satisﬁes the hypothesis of Lemma 5.5. Let (fa)a∈[0,1]2
be the family constructed in this lemma with z0 := 0. Recall that by [41, Theorem 4.14
on p. 83], for each a ∈ [0, 1]2, fa has three pairwise distinct regular contact points ξ1
a, ξ2
a,
ξa such that f (ξj
a) = σj, j = 1, 2, and fa(ξa) = τ . Consider the unique ga ∈ M¨ob(D)
such that ga(τ ) = ξa and ga(σj) = ξj
a, j = 1, 2. Then ha := fa ◦ ga ∈ U[{τ, σ1, σ2}] for
all a ∈ [0, 1]2. Now for a, b ∈ [0, 1]2 with a1 6 b1 and a2 6 b2, let ψa,b := h−1

b ◦ ha.

Now we are going to prove

Claim A:

If [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ aj(t) ∈ [0, 1]2, j = 1, 2, are non-decreasing absolutely
continuous functions with aj(0) = 0, aj(t) = 1 for all t > 1, then the functions

ψa(s),a(t), where a(t) := (cid:0)a1(t), a2(t)(cid:1), form an evolution family, with ψa(0),a(1) = φ.
The family φs,t := f −1
a(t) ◦ fa(s), t > s > 0, is an evolution family because, by properties (i),
(iii) and (v) from Lemma 5.5, φs,t’s are holomorphic self-maps of D obviously satisfying
conditions EF1 and EF2 and such that φs,t(0) = 0, φ′
0,t(0)|
is absolutely continuous. Moreover, for each t > 0, fa(t) ◦φ0,t = fa(0) = f(0,0) = φ and hence
with help of Lemma 5.1 we see that φ0,t has regular contact points at τ , σ1 and σ2 and that
the angular limits of φ0,t at these points are equal to f −1
a(t)(σ1) = ga(t)(σ1),
and f −1
a(t) ◦ φs,t ◦ ga(s) for all s > 0
and t > s. Thus, as above, we can use [11, Theorem 3.5] and [15, Lemma 2.8] to make
sure that (ψa(s),a(t)) is also an evolution family. Finally, by construction, h(1,1) = idD and
h(0,0) = f(0,0) = φ. Hence ψa(0),a(1) = h−1

a(t)(σ2) = ga(t)(σ2), respectively. Finally, ψa(s),a(t) = g−1

s,t(0) > 0, and [0, +∞) ∋ t 7→ |φ′

(1,1) ◦ h(0,0) = φ. This proves Claim A.

a(t)(τ ) = ga(t)(τ ), f −1

Note that ψa,b satisﬁes the hypothesis of Lemma 5.6(i) when a2 = b2 and the hypoth-

2) is strictly decreasing on [0, 1]. Consider now the map a : [0, +∞) → [0, 1]2 given
2), a(t) := (1, 2t)
2) 6 t 6 1, and a(t) := (1, 1) otherwise. By construction, (ψa,b) ⊂ P[{τ, σ1, σ2}]
2) is absolutely con-
1 ∈ [0, 1]. Thus we have

esis of Lemma 5.6(ii) when a1 = b1. For any a ∈ [0, 1]2 denote λ(a) := ψ′
an arbitrary a0
λ(·, a0
by a(t) := (0, 2t) if 0 6 t 6 1
if 1
and hence from Claim A and [11, Theorem 1.1] it follows that λ(·, a0
tinuous on [0, 1]. Similar argument applies to λ(a0
proved the following

2, a(t) := (2t − a0

Claim B: The function λ(a1, a2) := ψ′

(0,0),(a1 ,a2)(τ ), a1, a2 ∈ [0, 1], is strictly decreasing
in a1 and strictly increasing in a2. Moreover, it is absolutely continuous in each
variable.

Using Claim B and taking into account Remark 5.7, it is easy to show that there exists
a0
1 ∈ [0, 1) and a continuous strictly increasing function a∗
1) = 0
and a∗
1(0)]
by setting a∗

2 : [a0
2(a1)) = φ′(τ ) for any a1 ∈ [a0

1, 1] → [0, 1] with a∗
1, 1]. We extend it to [0, a∗

2(1) = 1 such that λ(a1, a∗

2(a0

2|[0,a0

1] ≡ 0.

The function A(a1) := [a1 + a∗

2(a1)]/2 is strictly increasing and continuous on [0, 1],
with A(0) = 0 and A(1) = 1. Therefore, it has the continuous and strictly increasing
2(a1(t))(cid:1)

inverse [0, 1] ∋ t 7→ a1(t) ∈ [0, 1]. The map a∗ : [0, 1] → [0, 1]2; t 7→ (cid:0)a1(t), a∗
is Lipschitz continuous. Indeed, if 0 6 t1 6 t2 6 1, then δ1 := a1(t2) − a1(t1) > 0,
δ2 := a∗

2(a1(t1)) > 0 and δ1 + δ2 = 2(t2 − t1).

2(a1(t2)) − a∗

Now apply Claim A to (a1(t), a2(t)) := a∗(t), where as before we extend a∗ to (1, +∞)
by a∗|(1,+∞) ≡ (1, 1). Recall that (ψa,b) ⊂ P[{τ, σ1, σ2}]. Therefore, to complete the proof
for Case (b) it remains to notice that by construction and by Claim B, t 7→ λ(a∗(t)) is
non-increasing, so that ψ′

a∗(s),a∗(t)(τ ) 6 1 whenever t > s > 0.

CASE (c): S = Uτ [F ] with τ ∈ D

If n = 1, then again the proof is the same as in Case (a), except that the conditions on
the family (gu) are replaced by gu(ϕ0,u(σ1)) = σ1 and gu(ϕ0,u(τ )) = τ for all u ∈ [0, 1] and
that we additionally notice that, according to condition EF3 in Deﬁnition 2.7, the map
[0, 1] ∋ u 7→ ϕ0,u(τ ) ∈ D is absolutely continuous.

Therefore, we may assume that n > 2. Replacing φ by g−1 ◦ φ ◦ g with a suitable
g ∈ M¨ob(D), we may also suppose that τ = 0. Then by Loewner’s Lemma (Theorem C),
the function φ satisﬁes the hypothesis of Lemma 5.5. Main step of the proof in Case (c)
is the following statement concerning the family (fa) constructed in Lemma 5.5.

Claim C: There exists a Lipschitz continuous map a∗ :

[0, 1] → [0, 1]n with non-
decreasing components a∗
j , j = 1, . . . , n, such that a∗(0) = (0, . . . , 0), a∗(1) =
(1, . . . , 1), and fa∗(t) ◦(z 7→ eiθ(t)z) ∈ P0[F ] for all t ∈ [0, 1] and some θ : [0, 1] → R.

20

P. GUMENYUK

Using Claim C and arguing essentially in the same way as in the proof of Claim A, it is
not diﬃcult to show that the functions ψs,t(z) := e−iθ(t)(f −1
a∗(t) ◦ fa∗(s))(eiθ(s)z), t > s > 0,
where we extend a∗ and θ by setting a∗|[1,+∞) ≡ (1, . . . , 1), θ|[1,+∞) ≡ θ(1), form the
desired evolution family: ψ0,1 = φ and ψs,t ∈ P0[F ] for all s, t ∈ [0, 1] with s 6 t.

It remains to prove Claim C. For a ∈ [0, 1]n and j ∈ [1, n] ∩ N, denote by Lj(a) the arc
of ∂D going in the counter-clockwise direction from f −1(σj) to f −1(σj+1). The condition
fa∗(t) ◦ (z 7→ eiθ(t)z) ∈ P0[F ] from Claim C can be rephrased as |Lj(a∗(t))| = |Lj| for
all t ∈ [0, 1] and all j = 1, . . . , n. Denote ℓj(a) := |Lj(a)| and ϕa,b := f −1
◦ fa for all
a, b ∈ [0, 1]n with aj 6 bj for any j = 1, . . . , n. Applying Loewner’s Lemma (Theorem C)
to the functions ϕa,a+δej , where δ > 0 and {ej}n
j=1 is the standard basis in Rn, and taking
j=1 ℓj ≡ 2π, we see that ℓj(a1, . . . , an) is strictly decreasing in aj and
strictly increasing in ak if k 6= j. Moreover, again by essentially the same argument as in
the proof of Claim A, ℓj’s are continuous in each variable. This allows us construct a∗ as
follows.

into account that Pn

b

Recall that f(1,...,1) = φ and hence ℓj(1) = ℓj(0) = |Lj| for all j = 1, . . . , n. Therefore,
thanks to the continuity and monotonicity of ℓj, there exists a map ˜a1 : [0, 1]n−1 → [0, 1]
continuous and strictly increasing in each variable such that we have ˜a1(0, . . . , 0) = 0,
˜a1(1, . . . , 1) = 1, and

ℓ1(˜a1(a′), a′) = |L1|

for all a′ := (a2, . . . , an) ∈ [0, 1]n−1.

Fix j ∈ [2, n] ∩ N. Recall that

ℓj = 2π − ℓ1 − Xk6=1,j

ℓk

and that ℓk(a) is strictly increasing in aj and in a1 for any k 6= 1, j. Therefore, a′ :=
(a2, . . . , an) 7→ ℓj(˜a1(a′), a′) is decreasing in aj and increasing in ak if k 6= j. Repeating
the above argument for ℓj’s, j = 1, . . . , n, replaced by a′ 7→ ℓj(˜a(a′), a′)’s, j = 2, . . . , n, we
conclude that there exists a map ˜a2 : [0, 1]n−2 → [0, 1] continuous and strictly increasing
in each variable such that ˜a2(0, . . . , 0) = 0, ˜a2(1, . . . , 1) = 1, and

ℓj(˜a1(˜a2, a′′), ˜a2(a′′), a′′) = |Lj|

for all a′′ := (a3, . . . , an) ∈ [0, 1]n−2 and j = 1, 2.

Repeat this procedure until we end up with a continuous map ˆa : [0, 1] → [0, 1]n−1
with strictly increasing components such that ˆa(0) = (0, . . . , 0), ˆa(1) = (1, . . . , 1), and
ℓj(ˆa(an), an) = |Lj| for all j := 1, . . . , n and all an ∈ [0, 1].

It remains to set a∗ := (ˆa ◦ q−1, q−1), where q−1 is the inverse of the function

q(an) :=

5.3. Proof of Corollary 1. Theorems 1 and 2 imply that the semigroup S := U 1[{−1}]
is the union of all evolution families (ϕs,t) lying in S. Note that if (ϕs,t) is such an evolution
family, then so is ( ˜ϕs,t) := (ϕs+s0,t+s0) for any s0 > 0. Therefore,

(5.3)

S = (cid:8) ˜ϕ0,t : t > 0, ( ˜ϕs,t) ⊂ S is an evolution family}.

For a given evolution family ( ˜ϕs,t) ⊂ S, consider the function of Λ(t) := log ˜ϕ′
0,t(σ),
σ := −1. By the very construction, Λ is non-decreasing. Moreover, if Λ(t) = Λ(s) for
some t > s > 0, then ˜ϕ′

s,t(σ) = 1, see Remark 4.1, and hence

˜ϕ0,t = ˜ϕs,t ◦ ˜ϕ0,s = ˜ϕ0,s,

because if we had S ∋ ˜ϕs,t 6= idD, then there would be two diﬀerent DW-points of ˜ϕs,t,
τ = 1 and σ = −1. Therefore, for any t0 > 0 there exists a family ( ˆϕs,t)06s6t6T0, T0 :=
Λ(t0), such that ˆϕΛ(s),Λ(t) = ˜ϕs,t whenever 0 6 s 6 t 6 t0. Clearly, using, e.g., the one-
parameter semigroup (φt) ⊂ S ∩ M¨ob(D), φt(z) := z+xt
et+1, we can extend the
family ( ˆϕs,t) to all t > s > 0 in such a way that it satisﬁes conditions EF1 and EF2 in
Deﬁnition 2.7 and ˆϕ′
0,t(σ) = et for all t > 0. Then by Theorem 3, ( ˆϕs,t) is an evolution
family.

1+xtz , xt := et−1

Taking into account the above argument and making use of [11, Theorem 1.1] 3, [28,

Theorem 1], and [26, Lemma 1], we conclude that for any T > 0, the set

ST := {ϕ ∈ S : ϕ′(−1) = eT }

coincides with the set of of all functions representable in the form ϕ(z) = wz(T ) for all
z ∈ D, where wz(t) is the unique solution to the initial value problem

6. An open problem

In view of the main result of this paper, it is plausible to conjecture that univalence of
all elements of a subsemigroup S ⊂ Hol(D, D) is “essentially” suﬃcient4 for S to admit
Loewner-type parametric representation. Recall also that for n > 3, Theorem 1 provides
a Loewner-type parametric representation only for the semigroup Uτ [F ] with τ ∈ D.

In this connection, the following question seems to be of considerable interest.

Open problem. Do the semigroups U[F ] and Uτ [F ] admit Loewner-type parametric rep-
resentation for any ﬁnite set F ⊂ ∂D and any τ ∈ ∂D \ F ?

Note that, in view of Theorems 1 and 2, the aﬃrmative answer for Uτ [F ], τ ∈ ∂D, would
imply also that for U[F ].
