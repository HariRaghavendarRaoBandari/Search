Abstract

Non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs), the sub-leading eﬀects in the ﬂavour transitions of

neutrinos, play a crucial role in the determination of the various unknowns in neutrino oscillations,

such as neutrino mass hierarchy, Dirac CP violating phase and the octant of atmospheric mixing

angle. In view of the recent experimental observation of several lepton ﬂavor universality (LFU)

violating observables in B decays, we study the possible implications of these interactions in the

determination of various neutrino oscillation parameters. We consider the model with an additional

Z ′ boson (which is quite successful in explaining the observed LFU anomalies) and analyze its
eﬀect in the lepton ﬂavour violating (LFV) τ decays, i.e., τ − → e−e+e− and τ − → e−π0. From the
present upper bounds of these decay rates, we obtain the constraints on the new physics parameters,

which are related to the corresponding NSI parameters in the neutrino sector by SU (2)L symmetry.

These new parameters are expected to have potential implications in the neutrino oscillation studies

and in this work we investigate the possibility of observing the eﬀects of these interactions in the

currently running and upcoming long-baseline experiments, i.e., T2K, NOνA and DUNE.

INTRODUCTION

With the discovery of the Higgs-like boson at the LHC [1], the standard model (SM)

seems to provide a complete picture of particle physics. While no new particles have been

discovered so far at the LHC, there are some indirect hints of new physics (NP) appeared in

the ﬂavor sector. One of such deviations is the recent observation of the violation of lepton
ﬂavor universality (LFU) in semileptonic B decays, both in the case of b → c charged-current
as well as in the case of b → s neutral current transitions. These results can be summarized
as follows:
• About 3.9σ deviation of τ /l universality (l = µ, e) in b → c transitions [2], i.e.,

R(D∗) =

R(D) =

Br(B → D∗τ ντ )
Br(B → D∗lνl)
Br(B → Dτ ντ )
Br(B → Dlνl)

= 0.322 ± 0.018 ± 0.012 ,

= 0.391 ± 0.041 ± 0.028 ,

(1)

from their corresponding SM values R(D∗)|SM = 0.252 ± 0.003 and R(D)|SM = 0.297 ±
0.017. Since these decays are mediated at tree level in the SM, relatively large new physics

contributions are necessary to explain these deviations.

• Observation of 2.6σ deviation of µ/e universality in the dilepton invariant mass bin

1 GeV2 6 q2 6 6 GeV2 in b → s transitions [3]:
Br(B → Kµ+µ−)
Br(B → Ke+e−)

RK =

= 0.745+0.090

−0.074 ± 0.036,

(2)

from the SM prediction RSM

K = 1.0003 ± 0.0001.

• CMS recently also searched for the decay h → τ µ and found a non-zero result of
−0.37 [4] which disagrees by about 2.4σ from 0, i.e. from the SM value.

Br(h → τ µ) = 0.84+0.39

These deviations from the SM have triggered a series of theoretical speculations about

possible existence of NP beyond the SM. Some of the prominent NP models which can explain

these deviations from the SM are: models with an extra Z ′ boson [5] and/or additional

Higgs doublets [6], models with leptoquarks [7] etc. The observation of lepton ﬂavour non-

universality eﬀects also provide the possibility of the observation of lepton ﬂavour violating

(LFV) decays [8]. Although so far, there is no concrete evidence of LFV decays but there
exist strict upper bounds in many LFV decays such as µ → eγ µ → eee, etc. Various
dedicated experiments are already planned to search for LFV decays.

2

In this paper, we would like to see the implications of the LFV interactions in various long-

baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In other words, we would like to explore whether

it is possible to observe these eﬀects in the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

In particular, we will focus on the NP contributions which could aﬀect only to the τ sector.

This is particularly interesting as the tauonic B decays provide an excellent probe of new

physics because of the involvement of heavy τ lepton. There are a few deviations observed

in the leptonic/semileptonic B decays with a τ in the ﬁnal state.

We consider the model with an additional Z ′ boson which can mediate ﬂavour changing

neutral current (FCNC) transitions at tree level. Z ′ gauge bosons, which are associated

with as extra U(1)′ gauge symmetry, are predicted theoretically in many extensions of the

SM [9], such as grand uniﬁed theories (GUTs), left-right symmetric models, E6 model,

supersymmetric models, superstring theories etc. Although the U(1)′ charges are in general

family-universal but it is not mandatory to be so, and the family non-universal Z ′ has been

introduced in some models, such as in E6 model [10].

On the experiment side also there are many eﬀorts undergoing to search for the Z ′ directly

at the LEP, Tevatron, and LHC. With the assumption that the coupling of Z ′ to the SM

fermions are similar to those of the SM Z boson, the direct searches for the Z ′ can be

performed in the dilepton events. At this stage, the lower mass limit has been set as 2.9

TeV at the 95% C.L. with 8 TeV data set by using e+e− and µ+µ− [11] events and this

value becomes 1.90 TeV using the τ +τ − events [12]. However, such constraints from the

LHC would not be valid if the Z ′ boson couples very weakly with the leptons, and thus one

has to rely on the hadronic channels.

This paper is organized as follows. In section II, we discuss the possible hints of new
physics in the decay mode B− → τ − ¯ν and obtain the constraints on the new physics param-
eters by comparing the experimental data with the corresponding theoretical prediction. In

section III, we extract the new physics parameters from the lepton ﬂavour violating decays
τ → eee and τ → eπ0, which are in general related to the NP parameters of the neutrino
sector by the SU(2)L symmetry. The basic formalism of neutrino oscillation including NSI

eﬀects are discussed in section IV. In section V, we study the eﬀect of NSI parameters on

νe appearance oscillation probability and the search for the new CP violating signals at

long-baseline experiments is presented in section VI. Section VII contains the summary and

conclusions.

II. NEW PHYSICS EFFECTS FROM B− → τ − ¯ν MODE

In this section, we would like to see the possible interplay of new physics in the leptonic
decay channel B− → τ − ¯ν. During the last few years, there has been a systematic disagree-
ment between the experimental and SM predicted value for the branching ratio of B → τ ν
mode. The branching ratio for B− → τ ντ is given as

Br(B− → τ ¯ντ ) =

G2
F
8π |Vub|2τB−f 2

BmBm2

τ(cid:18)1 −

m2
τ
m2

B(cid:19)2

.

(3)

This mode is very clean and the only non-perturbative quantity involved in the expression

for branching ratio (3) is the decay constant of B meson. However, there is still a tension

between the exclusive and inclusive value of Vub at the level of 3σ. This mode has been

precisely measured [13] with a value

Br(B− → τ − ¯ντ ) = (1.14 ± 0.27) × 10−4 .

The latest result from Belle collaboration [14]

Br(B− → τ − ¯ντ ) = (1.25 ± 0.28 ± 0.27) × 10−4 ,

(4)

(5)

also in the line of the previous measurements. Since there is an uncertainty between the
|Vub| values extracted from exclusive and inclusive modes, we use the SM ﬁtted value of its
branching ratio from UTﬁt collaboration [15]

Br(B− → τ − ¯ντ ) = (0.84 ± 0.07) × 10−4 .

(6)

This value agrees well with the experimental value (4). However, the central values of

these two results diﬀer signiﬁcantly. One can eliminate the Vub dependence completely by

introducing the LFU probing ratio

Rπ

τ /l =

= 0.73 ± 0.15 ,
which has around 2.6σ deviation from its SM prediction of Rπ,SM

τ /l = 0.31(6) [16]. Thus,
these deviations may be considered as the smoking gun signal of new physics associated

with the tauonic sector.

In the presence of generic NP, the most general eﬀective Hamiltonian for the process

b → ulν can be given as
4GF√2

Hef f =

Vubh(1 + gL)(¯lγµPLν)(¯uγµPLb) + gR(¯lγµPRν)(¯uγµPLb)i ,

where GF is the Fermi coupling constant and PL.R = (1∓γ5)/2 are the left and right handed
projection operators. For simplicity, here we consider only the vector and axial-vector type

couplings and also only the left-handed couplings for the quarks. The new physics coupling

gL involves left handed neutrinos, whereas the coupling gR involves right handed neutrinos.

Eq. (8) can be rewritten in a more elaborate form as

Hef f =

VubhGV (¯lγµPLν)(¯uγµb) − GA(¯lγµPLν)(¯uγµγ5b)

4GF√2
+ ˜GV (¯lγµPRν)(¯qγµb) + ˜GA(¯lγµPLν)(¯qγµγ5b)i ,

with

GV = GA = 1 + gL

˜GV = gR

˜GA = −gR .

(9)

(10)

In the SM, GA = GV = 1 and all other NP couplings are zero. From the eﬀective Hamiltonian

(9), one can obtain the decay width as

Γ(B → τ ν) =

B(cid:19)2

(|GA|2 + | ˜GA|2) .

(11)

Now comparing the experimental measured value of the branching ratio (4) with the corre-

sponding SM value (6), we obtain the constraints on the new physics parameters gL and gR

as depicted in Fig. 1, which are found to be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. Considering

only real values for the couplings gL and gR the constraints on gL and gR are shown in the
left panel. However, if we consider these couplings to be complex (i.e., gL = |gL|eiφ) and
vary the phase φ between [0 : 2π], the allowed parameter space is shown in the right panel.

From the ﬁgure, it can be noted that the new physics parameters are severely constrained if

the couplings are considered to be real. However, for complex couplings, the corresponding

bounds are considerably relaxed as seen from the right panel of the ﬁgure.

III. LEPTON FLAVOUR VIOLATING τ DECAYS

The violation of lepton ﬂavour universality in principle induce lepton ﬂavour violation.

In this section, we will consider the lepton ﬂavour violating τ decays which are induced

by neutral current interactions. As an example, here we will consider a simple and well-

motivated model which would induce lepton ﬂavour violating interactions at the tree level

is the model with an additional Z ′ boson. Many SM extensions often involve the presence

of an extra U(1)′ gauge symmetry and the corresponding gauge boson is generally known
as the Z ′ boson. In particular, here we will consider the decay channels τ → e−e+e− and
τ → e−π0 which have the upper limits [13] as

Br(τ − → e−e+e−) < 2.7 × 10−8 ,
Br(τ − → e−π0) < 8.0 × 10−8 .

(12)

In the Z ′ model, these decays are mediated at the tree level and hence, are expected to

have signiﬁcantly large branching ratios. In this model the coupling of Z ′ boson to charged

leptons can be written generically as

L ⊃ g′hεL

eτ ¯eγµPLτ + εR

eτ ¯eγµPRτi ,

(13)

where g′ is the new U(1)′ gauge coupling constant.

Let us ﬁrst consider the decay mode τ −(p) → e−(p1) + e−(p2) + e+(p3), which occurs at
one-loop level in the SM and has the upper bound on its branching ratio as 2.7 × 10−8 [13].
Since this mode is highly suppressed in the SM due to the tiny neutrino mass in the loop,

we will not include the SM contributions to this process in our analysis. However, in the Z ′

model this process can occur at the tree level due to the presence of FCNC coupling of the

Z ′ boson. Hence, it is natural to expect that in such a model the branching ratio can be

substantially enhanced and it could be possible that this mode can be probed experimentally.

6

The Feynman diagram for this process in the Z ′ model is shown in Fig. 2, where the blob

represents the tree level FCNC coupling of Z ′ boson (lepton ﬂavor violating coupling). Thus,

one can obtain the amplitude for this process as

boson to electron-positron pair. We assume these parameters have the same form as the

where we have neglected the electron mass. Now using the mass and lifetime of τ -lepton
from [13] and the experimental upper limit of the branching ratio of this mode Br(τ − →

eτ in the left panel of Fig.
3, where we have assumed the coupling g′ ≈ g and MZ ′=1 TeV. With these assumptions,
the bounds on coupling strengths are found to be in the range

Now assuming the left and right handed LFV couplings to be same, i.e., εL

(say), in the right panel of Fig. 3, we show the variation of these parameters with MZ ′ in
the range MZ ′ ∈ [700 : 1500] GeV. From the ﬁgure, one can see that the coupling strength
increases with the mass of Z ′ boson.

IV. NEUTRINO OSCILLATION WITH NSIS

Neutrino oscillation [17–23], the phenomenon of ﬂavour transition of neutrinos, provides

strong evidences for neutrino mass and mixing. Further, the three ﬂavour neutrino oscilla-

tion model has become a very successful theoretical framework, which could accommodate

almost all neutrino oscillation experimental data except some results in very short base-

line experiments. However, some of the oscillation parameters [24, 25] (Dirac CP violating

phase, neutrino mass hierarchy and the octant of atmospheric mixing angle) in the standard

paradigm are still not known. Recently, Daya Bay [26, 27], RENO [28] and Double CHOOZ

[29] experiments have observed that the value of reactor mixing angle is signiﬁcantly large

(close to its upper bound), which improves the sensitivities to the unknowns by enhancing

the matter eﬀect. Therefore, a well understanding of sub-leading contributions to neutrino

oscillation, coming from various new physics scenarios, may lead to the enhancement of

physics potentials of long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.

Non-standard neutrino interactions (NSIs) [30, 31] can be considered as sub-leading ef-

fects in the neutrino oscillations, which arise from various new physics scenarios beyond

the standard model. The NSIs, which come from Neutral Current (NC) interactions can

aﬀect the propagation of neutrino, whereas NSIs coming from the Charged Current (CC)

interactions of neutrinos with quarks and leptons can aﬀect the production and detection

processes of neutrinos. However, in this work, we consider only the NSIs which aﬀect the

propagation of neutrinos. The Lagrangian corresponds to NSIs during the propagation is

given by [32],

LNSI = −2√2GF εf C

αβ (ναγµPLνβ)(f γµPCf ) ,

(22)

where GF is the Fermi coupling constant, εf C
αβ are the new coupling constants so called NSI
parameters, f is fermion and PC = (1 ± γ5)/2 are the right (C = R) and left (C = L)
chiral projection operators. The NSI contributions which are relevant as neutrino propagate

through the earth are those coming from the interaction of neutrino with e, u and d because

the earth matter is made up of these fermions only. Therefore, the eﬀective NSI parameter

is given by

εαβ = Xf =e,u,d

nf
ne

εf
αβ ,

10

(23)

where εf

αβ = εf L

αβ + εf R

αβ , nf is the number density of the fermion f and ne the number density
of electrons in earth. For earth matter, we can assume that the number densities of electrons,
protons and neutrons are equal, i.e, nn ≈ np = ne, in which case nu ≈ nd = 3ne. Therefore,
one can write εαβ as [33]

εαβ ≈sXC

(εeC

αβ)2 + (3εuC

αβ )2 + (3εdC

αβ )2 .

(24)

NSIs and their consequences have been studied quite extensively in the literature both in

model dependent (mass models) and independent ways. Furthermore, there are studies,

which have been done to investigate the eﬀect of NSIs on atmospheric neutrinos [34–36],

solar neutrinos [37–41], accelerator neutrinos [42–52] and supernova neutrinos [53–55]. How-

ever, it is very crucial to understand the implications of new physics eﬀects at the long

baseline experiments like T2K, NOνA and DUNE. For this study, we discuss the theoretical

framework of neutrino oscillation in presence of non-standard interaction in the next section.

We have obtained the constraints on NSI parameter εeτ in Section III from the LFV decays
of tau lepton τ → eee and τ → eπ0 as εe
(24). In our analysis, we consider only the contributions from the NSI parameter εeτ and
use a conservative value for εeτ as εeτ ≈ 0.3, consistent with the bound obtained from lepton
ﬂavour violating tau decays. Thus, the eﬀective Hamiltonian for NSI that we consider is of

eτ < 0.2, which gives εeτ < 0.9 with Eqn

V. NSI EFFECT ON νµ → νe AND ¯νµ → ¯νe OSCILLATIONS

In this section, we discuss the consequences of NSI parameters εeτ and δeτ on νe(¯νe)

appearance probability as well as events at long-baseline experiments T2K, NOνA and

DUNE.

From section III, we have obtained the constraint on εeτ as εeτ < 0.9, however, in our
analysis we will use a conservative representative value εeτ ≈ 0.3. We use the analytical
(31) to study the implications of NSI in the
expression for P (νµ → νe) given in Eq.
propagation of neutrino at probability level. The values of standard oscillation parameters

that we use in the analysis are given in the Table I. For an illustration, we show the

(right) in both NH (top panel) and IH (bottom panel) cases in Fig. 6 for neutrinos and in

Fig. 7 for anti-neutrinos. In these ﬁgures, the light shaded regions correspond to probability

in the absence of NSI, whereas the dark shaded regions represent the additional contribution

to the oscillation probability in presence of NSI. From these ﬁgures, we can see that there

is signiﬁcant change in the oscillation probability in the presence of NSI for both NOνA

and DUNE, whereas for T2K it is found to be very small. Therefore, NOνA and DUNE

13

are sensitive to NSI eﬀects. It can also be noted that DUNE is more sensitive to NSI eﬀects

among the long-baseline experiments that we have considered in this analysis.

TABLE II: The experimental speciﬁcations.

When we compare the top and bottom panels of Figs. 6 and 7, we can see that there

is considerable overlap between the hierarchies in presence of NSIs and this overlap will

14

worsen the hierarchy determination capability of long-baseline experiments.

We present another simple way to understand this feature in the oscillation proba-

bility, which is especially coming from the NSI contribution of εeτ parameter, by using
bi-probability plots i.e, CP trajectory in a P(νµ→νe) − P(¯νµ→¯νe) plane. In Fig. 8, we show the
bi-probability plots for T2K (E = 0.6 GeV, L = 295 km), NOνA (E = 2 GeV, L = 810 km)

and DUNE (E = 3 GeV, L = 1300 km) for both NH (solid line) and IH (dashed line) cases.

The ellipses with dark-line (with NSI) are obtained by using εeτ = 0.3, δeτ = 0 and varying

δCP in its full range, whereas the ellipses with light-colored line (without NSI) are obtained

by using εeτ = 0, δeτ = 0 and varying δCP in its full range. In the ﬁgure, the light coloured

ellipses correspond to the standard neutrino paradigm. The NH and IH light coloured

ellipses are well separated in the case of DUNE experiment, when compared with T2K

and NOνA experiments. This means that DUNE experiment has highest mass hierarchy

determination capability. However, when we add the NSI contributions coming from εeτ ,

we can see that the corresponding dark coloured ellipses overlap with each other. This

overlap signiﬁcantly worsen the hierarchy determination capability of DUNE experiment.

Each intersection points in the biprobability plots show the various degeneracies among the

oscillation parameters in the presence of NSIs.

In Fig. 9, we show the eﬀect of NSI on the determination of octant of atmospheric

mixing angle θ23. We consider only the contribution from εeτ by keeping its value as εeτ

= 0.3 and obtain CP trajectories for NH-LO, NH-HO, IH-LO and IH-HO cases.

In the

ﬁgure, the light coloured ellipses, which correspond to CP trajectories for standard neutrino

oscillation, are well separated, i.e, octant degeneracy can be resolved. However, there is

signiﬁcant overlap between the CP trajectories of HO and LO in presence of NSI in the case

of NOνA and DUNE. This overlap worsen the octant resolution capability of NOνA and

DUNE experiments.

We use GLoBES package [59, 60] to simulate the experiments T2K, NOνA and DUNE.

The experimental details are given in Table II. Figs. 10 and 11 show the event rates in the

presence (red and green) and absence (blue) of NSI with δCP = 0 (left panel) and δCP =

π/2 (right panel) with mass hierarchy as NH (upper panel) and IH (lower panel) for NOνA

and DUNE experiments respectively. From the ﬁgures, we can see that NSI introduces

and without (light lines) NSIs for both LO (solid line) and HO (dashed line) cases. The upper

VI. SEARCH FOR CP SIGNALS WITH NSIS

One of the main objectives of long-baseline neutrino experiments is to determine the CP

violation (CPV) in the lepton sector. Therefore, it is crucial to study the eﬀect of NSI on

the determination of CPV at T2K, NOνA and DUNE experiments. This can be done at

probability level by analyzing the νe appearance and ¯νe appearance probabilities. We use

the observable so called CP asymmetry (ACP ) to quantify the eﬀects due to CP violation

and it is deﬁned as

ACP =

Pµe − P µe
Pµe + P µe

,

(34)

where Pµe is the νe appearance probability and P µe is ¯νe appearance probability. Fig. 12

shows the CP asymmetry bands for T2K (left panel), NOνA (middle panel) and DUNE

(right panel) without NSI (light coloured band) and with NSI (dark coloured band) by

assuming both normal (top panel) and inverted (bottom panel) hierarchies. The solid black

line corresponds to CP asymmetry for δCP = 0 without NSI, whereas the dashed white line

corresponds to CP asymmetry for δCP = 0 with NSI (εeτ = 0.3). The dark bands in the

ﬁgure show the impact of changing the phase of NSI parameter on ACP . Therefore, the

dark bands correspond to the fake CP signals which are coming from NSI. From the ﬁgures,

we can see that there is no much change in the asymmetry with NSI and without NSI in

the case of T2K, whereas in the case of NOνA the bands show that there is large change in

the asymmetry with NSI and without NSI. Moreover, the change in the asymmetry is too

large in the case of DUNE. From the ﬁgure, it is clear that NSI can give fake CP signals

even without considering contributions from the intrinsic phase (δeτ ) of NSI parameter and

therefore it is very diﬃcult to determine the CP violation in presence of new physics scenario.

VII. SUMMERY AND CONCLUSIONS

Conservation of lepton ﬂavour universality (LFU) is one of the unique features of the SM.

However, recently there are a series of experimental results in B physics pointing towards

possible violations of LFU, both in the charged and neutral current mediated semileptonic

decays. Such lepton ﬂavour universality violation could in principle also induce lepton ﬂavour
violating interactions. Considering the lepton ﬂavour violating decays of τ leptons τ → eee
and τ → eπ0 decays, we constrain the lepton ﬂavour violating couplings in the Z ′ model
using the upper limits of the corresponding branching ratios. We obtained a stringent bound
|εeτ| < 0.9 from these decay rates. Assuming these NSI parameters in the charged lepton
sectors to be related to the corresponding NSI parameters in the neutrino sector by SU(2)L

symmetry, we have studied the possible implications of these new physics interactions in

the long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In our analysis considering a conserva-

tive representative value for εeτ as εeτ = 0.3, we have investigated its implications in the

sensitivity studies various neutrino oscillation parameters in the long-baseline experiments.

We found that the NSI eﬀect in the eτ sector plays a crucial role in the determination of

mass hierarchy and octant-degeneracy of the atmospheric mixing angle. We found that NSIs

aﬀect the oscillation data of long-baseline experiments remarkably. Moreover, NSI can lead

to new degeneracies among the oscillation parameters. We also found that the possibility

of misinterpretation of oscillation data in the presence of new physics scanarios (NSIs), give
