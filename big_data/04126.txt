In the framework of quantum open systems we analyze data from KamLAND by using a model
that considers neutrino oscillation in a three-family approximation with the inclusion of the deco-
herence eﬀect. Using a χ2 test we ﬁnd new limits for the decoherence parameter which we call
γ, considering the most recent data by KamLAND. Assuming an energy dependence of the type
γ = γ0 (E/E0)n, in 95 % C.L. the limits found are 3.7 × 10−27GeV for n = −1, 6.8 × 10−22GeV for
n = 0, and 1.5 × 10−16GeV for n = 1 on the energy dependence.

INTRODUCTION

In general, the study of vacuum neutrino oscillations
is made in the framework of usual Quantum Mechanics,
which considers the system of neutrinos as isolated. In
this work we will do a diﬀerent kind of analysis, in the
framework of Quantum Open Systems, considering that
the neutrinos, which will be our subsystem of interest,
have a coupling with the enviroment.

The theory of Quantum Open Systems was one of the
theories created to deal with the case in which the sys-
tem of interest is not considered isolated [1, 2]. In this
theory, the system of interest is regarded as having a
coupling with the enviroment, and such coupling has im-
portant consequences, since we are dealing with quantum
systems.

As we will see, the coupling with the enviroment will
act changing the superposition of states, eliminating the
coherence, similarly to what we have when a measure-
ment is made in a quantum system. We see then, that
this coupling generates a decoherence eﬀfect. We can ﬁnd
in the literature studies of the decoherence eﬀect applied
to neutrino oscillations [3–6].

Using this diﬀerent approach to study neutrino oscil-
lations we see that diﬀerent forms of the survival prob-
ability are obtained [3], and the goal of this work is to
test one form of the equations for the survival proba-
bility with decoherence using data from the KamLAND
experiment.

KamLAND [7–10] is a Long Baseline experiment, lo-
cated at the Kamioka mine, Gifu, Japan, made to detect
electron antineutrinos which come from nuclear reactors
being at an average distance of ∼ 180km from the detec-
tor. It was constructed to test the so called Large Mixing
Angle (LMA) solution for the solar neutrino problem [11],

and its results were found to have a striking agreement
with solar neutrino results [6].

The goal of this work is to obtain new limits for the pa-
rameter γ which describes decoherence, considering the
most recent KamLAND data. We will also stress its rel-
evance and the diﬀerence between the results found in
this work from others such as the one from [6]. But ﬁrst
we review the Theory of Quantum Open Systems, and
then we see how it can be used to study neutrino os-
cillations.
In the case considered, we will see how the
decoherence eﬀect arises, generating a diﬀerent form of
the survival probability, which is tested using a χ2 test.
We show then the results of the simulations and the lim-
its of the parameters. In 95 % C.L. the limits found are
3.7 × 10−27GeV for n = −1, 6.8 × 10−22GeV for n = 0,
and 1.5 × 10−16GeV for n = 1, assuming an energy de-
pendence of the type γ = γ0 (E/E0)n.

II. FORMALISM

In this section we will introduce the formalism used
to obtain probabilities with dissipation eﬀects from the
Lindblad Master Equation. In this formalism the neu-
trinos are treated as an open quantum system and it in-
teracts with the quantum environment. We assume that
the quantum environment works as a reservoir. These
two quantum states compose the global system, and from
the interaction between neutrinos and environment arise
the dissipation eﬀects [1, 12]. In Quantum Open System
theory it is possible to show that if the interaction be-
tween the subsystem of interest, which are the neutrinos
in this case, and the reservoir is weak, the dynamic can
be made by the Lindblad Master Equation [1, 12]. A re-
view of the fundamentals of quantum open system theory
can be found in the following Refs. [1, 12].

The Lindblad Master Equation can be written as [13,

14]:

ρ(t) = −i[H, ρ(t)] + D[ρ(t)]

d
dt

(1)

with,

D[ρ(t)] =

N 2−1(cid:88)

(cid:16)

k=1

2

[Vk, ρ(t)V

(cid:17)

†
k ] + [Vkρ(t), V

†
k ]

,

(2)

where N is the dimension of the Hilbert space of the sub-
system of interest. In this equation we see a term which
is equal to the one we have in the Liouville Equation, but
we also have the term D[ρ(t)] which appears because we
are dealing with an open system, diﬀerent from what we
have in usual Quantum Mechanics, where the system is
considered isolated.

We will impose on this equation that the entropy in-
creases with time, in order that D[ρ(t)] evolves a pure
state to a state of maximal mixing asymptotically. Us-
ing the Von Neumann entropy it is possible to show that
this condition leads to restrictions on the operator Vk, in
particular we see that it must be Hermitian [15].

The Lindblad Equation in (1) can be expanded in the
basis of SU (3) matrices, since the three neutrino families
are considered in this work. In this form, each operator
in Eq. (1) can be expanded as Oµ = aµλµ, where λ are
the Gell-Mann matrices. Then, the evolution equation in
Eq. (1) can be written as

d
dx

ρk(x)Fk = 2ijkHiρj(x)Fk + Dklρl(x)Fk ,

(3)

with Dµ0 = D0ν = 0 to keep the probability conserva-
tion.

It is important to note that the ˙ρ0(t) = 0 and its so-
lution is given by ρ0(t) = 1/N , where N is the number
of families. For simplicity, we do not include this compo-
nent in the equation above.

There are many parameters in the dissipator matrix
Dkl. However, it is possible to reduce the number of these
parameters considerably if we impose some physical and
mathematical constraints.

In order to obtain a dissipator matrix Dkl with param-
eters that describe well known eﬀects, we can impose ﬁrst
that [H, Vk] = 0. From the physical point of view, this
commutation relation implies energy conservation in the
neutrino subsystem and also this constraint includes the
decoherence eﬀect in the evolution. This eﬀect eliminates
the quantum coherence, and the oscillation probability is
changed by damping terms that are multiplied by os-
cillation terms. In this condition, the Dkl assumes the
following form

Dkm = −{γ21, γ21, 0, γ31, γ31, γ32, γ32, 0} ,

(4)

where each γij can describe the decoherence eﬀect be-
tween the families i and j [4].

The energy conservation constraint on the neutrino
subsystem is very rigorous because once the neutrinos
are free to interact with the reservoir the energy can
ﬂuctuate, and hence this constraint may not be satisﬁed.
So, we can contemplate the situation where [H, Vk] (cid:54)= 0

2

adding other two new parameters in D33 and D88 such
that the dissipator in Eq. (4) becomes

Dkm = −{γ21, γ21, γ33, γ31, γ31, γ32, γ32, γ88}

(5)

where again γij can describe the decoherence eﬀect be-
tween the families i and j, while γ33 and γ88 describe the
so called relaxation eﬀect.

The relaxation eﬀect is a phenomenon that dynam-
ically leads the states to their maximal mixing state.
This phenomenon appears in the oscillation probabili-
ties through the damping term multiplied by terms that
depend only on mixing parameters. Then, when the re-
laxation eﬀect is taken into account the probabilities tend
asymptotically to 1/N , where N is the number of families
initially considered.

In general, if a particular density matrix represents an
initial physical state, the density matrix evolved by Eq.
(1) may be not a well-deﬁned quantum state. Complete
positivity is a constraint on Dkl which always keeps the
evolution made by Eq.
(1) as being physical [12, 16].
From complete positivity the Dkl needs to be a positive
matrix and this is satisﬁed if the diagonal elements of Dkl
are larger than oﬀ-diagonal elements. So, we are going
to consider the dissipator matrix obtained in Eq. (5) to
evolve the neutrinos according to the complete positivity,
which corresponds to the most eﬀective dissipator that
we can obtain. Any other oﬀ-diagonal element can be
represented in function of the main diagonal elements,
since the γ33 and γ88 parameters are non-null.

It is possible to prove that the Hamiltonian in the ef-

fective mass basis is written as

The Hamiltonian in Eq. (6) is useful in the case where

We have deﬁned a diagonal form to the Hamiltonian

remain diagonal as well.

These damping terms in the diagonal elements describe
the relaxation eﬀect through the parameters γ33 and γ88.
Besides that, they depend on the mixing parameters θ12
and θ13 and the distance between the source and the de-
tection point. The main diagonal in state (12) can be
interpreted as the probabilities to ﬁnd ˜m1, ˜m2 or ˜m3 of
the observable H in Eq. (6). In usual quantum mechan-
ics, these elements do not change with the propagation.
So, analysing the state in (12) we can see how the relax-
ation eﬀect act on the probabilities.

The state in (12) shows how the relaxation eﬀect de-
pends on the propagation distance. Considering MSW,
the solution for solar neutrinos, we expect that the relax-
ation eﬀects are strongly constrained by neutrinos of this
source. We will present this analysis somewhere else, but
the Sun-Eath distance is of the order of 1017 eV−1 and
a rough limit for both relaxation parameters is 10−18
eV, if the relaxation eﬀects have these magnitudes, the
damping terms stay around exp[−γiix] ∼ 1. Thus, the
analysis of reactor neutrinos can disregard the relaxation
eﬀect because the larger baseline to this source is much
smaller than Sun-Earth distance.

The oﬀ-diagonal elements are known as coherence el-
ements. In state (12), due to the damping terms these
elements tend to zero during the propagation . This is
the exact deﬁnition of the decoherence eﬀect. But, in the
solar neutrino context, these elements are avereged out

3

and then any decoherence eﬀect information is lost if we
consider a model-independent approach [17]. This is also
happens here in the cases of the coherence elements ρi3,

that dependent on (cid:101)∆i3x with i (cid:54)= 3 which oscillate very
fast, and hence are avereged out. It happens in the case
12|. So,
of KamLAND, because |∆m2

eﬀects, the state is given by:

13| ∼ |∆m2

(14)

and using the Eq. (10) to write the state above in the
ﬂavor basis, the survival probability can be obtained by
taking

Pνα→να = T r[ρα(0)ρα(t)]

(15)
where the initial state for ¯νe is ρα(0) = diag{1, 0, 0}. So,
the survival probability is given by [10]:

P 3ν

(17)
that is the same probability obtained in two-neutrino ap-
proximation when the decoherence eﬀect is taken into
account [17].

It is important to explain the diﬀerence between the
analysis made in this work and the one made in [6], where
they use a diﬀerent set of data from KamLAND (older
than the one considered here), but also consider data
from solar neutrinos.

The ﬁrst diﬀerence is that we are dealing with three
neutrino families. Moreover, as shown in [3] and we men-
tioned before, there are cases in which, besides the deco-
herence eﬀect, other eﬀects arise from the coupling with
the enviroment, such as the so called relaxation eﬀect
[3]. Since in our case, as previously shown, decoherence
is the only relevant eﬀect in the interaction with the en-
viroment, including solar neutrinos in the analysis would
not bring any new information regarding the decoherence
parameter, since solar neutrinos cannot be used to bound
decoherence, because the fast oscillating terms in ∆m2
i3,
i (cid:54)= 3, and ∆m2
12 average out all the coherence terms,
as said in [18] and shown in [17] and mentioned before.
Therefore, the eﬀect studied here is diﬀerent from the
one studied by Lisi et al in [6]. According to [17], Lisi
et al found limits for the parameter referent to the re-
laxation eﬀect in [6], and for the decoherence parameter
through a model-dependent approach. We use a model-
independent approach in this paper to analyze the Kam-
LAND data.

III. RESULTS

4

In Ref.

[10] from March 2011, we have a set of data,
in which the number of energy bins is 20. For this set of
data, we made a test using the usual oscillation proba-
12 = 8.05× 10−5eV 2,
bility which are: χ2
tan2(θ12) = 0.44. We can see that χ2
min is close to the
number of degrees of freedom, indicating a good agree-
ment with the experimental data.

min = 24.88, ∆m2

Considering now the oscillation probability in Eq. (17)
with the three family approximation (Eq. 21), and the
12, tan2(θ12) and γ, and also
three free parameters ∆m2
considering an energetic dependence on γ:

did this test for n = 0, n = 1 and n = −1.
PDG [19], sin2(2θ13) = 9.3 × 10−2 .

We also considered the best-ﬁt value for θ13 given by

The best-ﬁt results for this case can be seen in Table

I, for the three values of n.

Where again we see that the value of χ2

min is close to

the number of degrees of freedom.

We can also see that including the third parameter γ
improves the ﬁt, with a decrease in the value of χ2
min for
the program with three free parameters, comparing with
the program in which we made γ = 0.

Here we also made conﬁdence level curves for n = 0
in the energy dependence, which can be seen in Figs. 1,
2 and 3, and in accordance to the PDG Booklet [19] we
chose the values of ∆χ2 to get conﬁdence levels of 68.27%,
90%, 95%, 99%, 99.73% C.L.

We can see from Figs. 1 to 9 that the decoherence ef-
fect does not alter the value of ∆m2, which is consistent
with our previous analysis, since the damping term de-

pending on γ acts only on the amplitude of the survival
probability.

From the conﬁdence level curves of Figs. 1 to 9 above,
we can obtain limits for the oscillation parameters and
for γ0, the decoherence parameter. For 95% C. L. the
upper limits on γ0 are given in table II:

In order to visualize the eﬀect of the inclusion of deco-
herence in our study of neutrino oscillations, we can re-
produce an important graph originally presented by the
KamLAND Collaboration.

Following the same procedure used by KamLAND we

used our results to make Fig. 10, which is the result of
merging the original graph [10] and the graph we made
for oscillation with decoherence.

In Fig. 10 we can see that the ﬁt of the data made from
our model of oscillation with decoherence is a good ﬁt of
the data, showing a visual conﬁrmation of the analysis
provided by the χ2 Test.

We see that the inclusion of decoherence causes a
damping on the oscillation pattern, as we already ex-
pected from our theoretical predictions. We can also see
that this damping is not too strong, because if we com-
pare the size of the error bars of the original graph with

the oscillation with decoherence curves for the diﬀerent
values of n in the energy dependence, we can see that it
is still a possible curve to ﬁt the data from KamLAND.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, we treated the appearence of the decoher-
ence eﬀect on neutrino oscillations in a phenomenological
approach, studying ﬁrst Quantum Open Systems in gen-
eral, and then aplying the results to the case of neutrino
oscillation in three families, since it is one of the models
used in the analysis of KamLAND data.

The results were obtained when we considered the most
recent set of data, provided by Ref. [10], where the num-
ber of events were presented for 20 bins. Comparing the
value of χ2
min with the number of degrees of freedom,
we saw that including the third parameter, γ, improved
considerably the ﬁt of the data. With γ = 0 we obtained
χ2
min = 24.88, and for γ as a free parameter (hence 20
experimental points and 3 parameters) we obtained a de-
crease of at least 3 unit for χ2
min. These results are suma-
rized in table I. We also found a best-ﬁt value with γ (cid:54)= 0.
To support the results of our analysis, giving a more
visual way of evaluating the results, we reproduced an
important graph originally presented by the KamLAND
Collaboration, which showed the survival probability ver-
sus L0/E, and is a graph that shows clearly the oscilla-
tion pattern for the neutrinos.

Comparing the original graph with our reproduction
of the graph, which mas made using the best-ﬁt values
obtained in our simulation, we saw that our model pro-
vided a ﬁt of the data which was indeed in agreement
with the experiment uncertainties, as can be seen in Fig.
10. So we have another evidence that our model provides
a good ﬁt for the experimental data.

We also determined new limits for γ0, in 95% C.L..
The limits are presented in Table II, and were determined
based on the conﬁdence level curves made from this most
recent set of data [10], and are in Figs. 1 to 9.

model for oscillation with decoherence considering best-ﬁt val-
