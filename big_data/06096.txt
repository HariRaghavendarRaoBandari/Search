POPULATION III STARS AROUND THE MILKY WAY

Yutaka Komiya1, Takuma Suda1 and Masayuki Y. Fujimoto23

Draft version March 22, 2016

ABSTRACT

We explore the possibility of observing Population III (Pop III) stars, born of the primordial gas.
Pop III stars with masses below 0.8 M⊙ should survive to date though are not observed yet, but the
existence of stars with low metallicity as [Fe/H] < −5 in the Milky Way halo suggests the surface
pollution of Pop III stars with accreted metals from the interstellar gas after birth. In this paper,
we investigate the runaway of Pop III stars from their host mini-halos, considering the ejection of
secondary members from binary systems when their massive primaries explode as supernovae. These
stars save them from the surface pollution. By computing the star formation and chemical evolution
along with the hierarchical structure formation based on the extended Press–Schechter merger trees,
we demonstrate that several hundreds to tens of thousands of low-mass Pop III stars escape from the
building blocks of the Milky Way. The second and later generations of extremely metal-poor (EMP)
stars are also escaped from the mini-halos. We discuss the spatial distributions of these escaped
stars by evaluating the distances between the mini-halos in the branches of merger trees under the
spherical collapse model of dark matter halos. It is demonstrated that the escaped stars distribute
beyond the stellar halo with a density proﬁle close to the dark matter halo, while the Pop III stars
are slightly more centrally concentrated . Some escaped stars leave the Milky Way and spread into
the intergalactic space. Based on the results, we discuss the feasibility of observing the Pop III stars
with the pristine surface abundance.

1. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst generation stars in the context of the cosmic
chemical evolution are expected to be metal-free, and are
referred to as Population III (Pop III) stars. One of the
key questions in the galactic archeology is whether or not
there are low-mass Pop III stars. If some of Pop III stars
are born with low mass that have survived until now,
they may still shine as nuclear burning stars in the solar
vicinity. We refer to Pop III stars with such low masses
(< 0.8 M⊙) as Pop III survivors in this paper.

In the context of star formation, the mass range of
Pop III stars has been investigated by many compu-
tational studies. Recent numerical simulations of the
ﬁrst star formation have proposed pathways to form
low-mass Pop III stars. These studies reveal that a
primordial gas cloud fragments to form a binary (e.g.
Machida et al. 2008; Turk et al. 2009; Stacy et al. 2010;
Stacy & Bromm 2013) or a star cluster (e.g. Clark et al.
2011; Greif et al. 2011; Susa et al. 2014) without met-
als. The predicted mass functions of the Pop III proto-
stars extend down to ∼ 0.8 M⊙ or below (Clark et al.
2011; Greif et al. 2011; Stacy & Bromm 2013). Some
protostars may remain low-mass stars depending on the
eﬃciency of later gas accretion and merging of proto-
stars after the end of the computations (Greif et al. 2011;
Smith et al. 2011).

Observationally, on the other hand, no stars with zero
surface metallicity have ever been found yet despite in-
tensive large-scale surveys in the Milky Way (MW) halo

(e.g., HK survey, Beers et al. 1992; Hamburg/ESO[HES]
survey, Christlieb et al. 2001; SDSS/SEGUE, Yanny et
al. 2009; and SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey, Keller
et al. 2007) These surveys have found thousands of can-
didates of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars. Several
hundreds of stars with [Fe/H] < −3 have received fol-
low up observations with high-resolution spectroscopy.
Among these EMP stars, there are ﬁve hyper metal-poor
(HMP) stars with [Fe/H] ≤ −5 and four additional ultra
metal-poor (UMP) stars with −5 < [Fe/H] < −4.5 but
no star with Z = 0. The most iron-deﬁcient star (SMSS
J031300.36-670839.3, Keller et al. 2014, hereafter SMSS
J0313-6708) shows no evidence of iron ([Fe/H] < −7.52,
Bessell et al. 2015), but it shows the enhancement of
some other elements ([Ca/H] = −7.26, [Mg/H] = −4.08,
[C/H] = −2.55).

One plausible explanation for the absence of metal-free
star is surface pollution on Pop III survivors (Yoshii 1981;
Iben 1983). It is argued that Pop III stars can be changed
to HMP/UMP stars through pollution by accreting the
interstellar medium (ISM) with metals (Shigeyama et al.
2003; Suda et al. 2004; Komiya et al. 2009b). In our pre-
vious studies (Komiya et al. 2010, 2015), we investigate
the change of the surface iron abundance by the ISM ac-
cretion for Pop III survivors, considering the hierarchical
galaxy formation process and the chemical enrichment
history. We demonstrate that the surface abundance of
iron typically amounts to [Fe/H] = −5 or −6 for Pop III
giants. The predicted distribution of surface metallic-
ity of Pop III survivors shows good agreement with the
observations of HMP/UMP stars including SMSS J0313-
6708. The ISM accretion on Pop III stars mainly takes
place in mini-halos in which the relative velocity between
stars and gas is much lower than in the present MW.

Another possible reason for the absence of the identi-

2

Komiya et al.

ﬁed metal-free star is the concentration of Pop III sur-
vivors in the MW bulge. It is asserted that the very ear-
liest stars in the MW may have centrally concentrated
distribution (Diemand et al. 2005), while the searches for
metal-poor stars have targeted the MW halo. Later nu-
merical studies of galaxy formation considering metal
enrichment, however, show that Pop III survivors are
likely to be distributed throughout the MW stellar halo
(Scannapieco et al. 2006; Brook et al. 2007; Gao et al.
2010).

In our previous study, we have shown that the pre-
dicted surface metallicity distribution of the polluted
Pop III stars well matches the low-metallicity tail of
the observed metallicity distribution function (MDF;
Komiya et al. 2015). This result gives a support to our
scenario that the observed HMP/UMP stars are the pol-
luted Pop III stars, though is not yet conclusive. There
are actually other scenarios for HMP/UMP stars as the
second or later generations of stars. Type II super-
novae (SNe) with very small iron yield (faint SNe) ow-
ing to the mixing and fallback mechanism have been ar-
gued as plausible progenitors for carbon-rich HMP/UMP
stars (Umeda & Nomoto 2003;
Iwamoto et al. 2005;
Tominaga et al. 2007; Ishigaki et al. 2014; Marassi et al.
2014). Heger & Woosley (2010), Keller et al. (2014), and
Bessell et al. (2015) proposed SNe II without iron pro-
duction as progenitors for SMSS 0313-6708 assuming the
suppression of the mixing on the basis of the hydrody-
namical simulations (Joggerst et al. 2009). Another pos-
sible scenario is that the ejecta from a normal SN II is
diluted with very large mass (∼ 108 M⊙) to form HMP
stars (Karlsson 2006). In addition, Meynet(2006) argued
that HMP stars are formed from gas ejected by stellar
wind from rotating massive stars.

In order to answer whether or not there are low-mass
Pop III survivors, it is crucial to observe stars with truly
primordial compositions.
In this paper, we propose a
pathway to observe pure Pop III survivors, free from
surface pollution, by considering an escape of Pop III
survivors from their host mini-halos in which they are
born.

Theoretical studies of primordial star formation have
shown that Pop III stars are formed in the dark mat-
ter halos of very small mass (∼ 106 M⊙, Tegmark et al.
1997, Yoshida et al. 2003). Due to the shallow gravita-
tional potential well, low-mass Pop III stars can escape
from these mini-halos to intergalactic space. The escaped
Pop III survivors are almost free from the surface pollu-
tion by gas accretion because of the very low gas density
and low metallicity of the intergalactic space. In this pa-
per, we estimate the escape probability and the number
of the escaped Pop III stars around the MW. We also
investigate the spatial distribution and observability of
the escaped Pop III stars.

Pop III stars have two possible escape channels
from mini-halos as Population I runaway stars (e.g.
Gies & Bolton 1986; Fujii & Zwart 2011). One is an
ejection of the secondary star from a binary system at
the supernova explosion of its primary star (Blaauw
1961). The other is a gravitational slingshot from a
star cluster (Poveda et al. 1967).
If Pop III stars were
formed in a star cluster, they have a chance to escape via
gravitational, multi-body interactions (Greif et al. 2011;
Stacy & Bromm 2013).
In this paper, we consider the

former channel since we do not have the precise knowl-
edge of the kinematics of stars in Pop III star clusters.

In this paper, we also estimate the number and distri-
bution of the escaped EMP survivors. Observations of
these escaped EMP survivors can provide insights into
the star-formation history and merging history of mini-
halos.

This paper is organized as follows. In the next section,
we estimate the escape probability of Pop III survivors
in SN binaries from the mini-halos. Then, we compute
the number of the escaped Pop III survivors from the
building block mini-halos of the MW using the hierar-
chical chemical evolution model based on the extended
Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism (Section 3).
In Sec-
tion 4, we derive the spatial distribution of these mini-
halo escapees by evaluating the distances between the
mini-halos in the EPS merger trees under the spherical
collapse approximation. We discuss the observability of
the escaped Pop III survivors in Section 5 and provide a
summary in Section 6.

2. ESCAPE PROBABILITY OF POP III

SURVIVORS

We estimate the escape probability of Pop III survivors
from their host mini-halos at the SN explosion in binary
systems.

When the primary star of a binary system explodes
as an SN, its secondary companion is released from the
system if more than half of the total mass is lost from
the system. The released secondary star escapes from
the host mini-halo if the kinetic energy of the star is
larger than the sum of the gravitational potential of the
host mini-halo and of the binary system after the SN
explosion, i.e.,

where vorb is the orbital velocity of the secondary star
at the SN explosion, abin is the separation of a binary,
mrem is the mass of the remnant (a neutron star or a
black hole) of a primary star, and φh is the gravitational
potential at a distance, r, from the center of a mini-halo
with mass, Mh, and the formation redshift, z.

We estimate the escape probability under the following
assumptions. Pop III stars are formed at the center of
mini-halos. The gravitational potential of a mini-halo is
given by the NFW proﬁle with the concentration param-
eter c = 10. The escape velocity at the mini-halo center
is

where ∆c is the overdensity of the virialized halo rela-
tive to the critical density of the universe, and ΩM(z) is
the matter density relative to the critical density (e.g.
Barkana & Loeb 2001; Mo et al. 2010).

The escape probability is dependent on the initial mass
function (IMF) of Pop III stars. The Pop III IMF is
not well understood though it is thought to be more
massive than the Pop I and Pop II stars. Hirano et al.
(2014) and Susa et al. (2014) followed Pop III star for-
mation in many mini-halos in large-volume cosmologi-
cal simulations and showed that the mass distribution

Fig. 1.— Escape probability of low-mass secondary companions

escape probability against the mass, Mh, of their host mini-halos.
Colors and line types denote the formation redshift, z, of mini-

of Pop III stars ranges from 10 M⊙ to 1000 M⊙, and
from 1 M⊙ to 300 M⊙, respectively. On the other hand,
Greif et al. (2011) and Stacy & Bromm (2013) argued
that the mass of Pop III stars shows almost ﬂat distribu-
tion between 0.1 M⊙ to 10 M⊙ and 0.3 M⊙ to 30 M⊙,
respectively.
In our previous studies, we have given
constraints on the IMF of EMP stars assuming a log-
normal function based on the number fraction of carbon-
enhanced stars which underwent binary mass transfer
events from intermediate-mass AGB stars (Komiya et al.
2007, 2009a), and have yielded the values of the median
mass, Mmd,EMP, values of 2.5 − 20 M⊙ and the disper-
sion, σ, values of ∼ 0.4. The rarity of HMP stars and
the absence of observed Pop III stars indicate the median
mass of Pop III stars, Mmd,Pop3, should be larger than
Mmd,EMP (Komiya et al. 2010, 2015). Here, we use the
log-normal IMF with σ = 0.4 and adopt a wide parame-
ter range for the median mass of Mmd = 3 − 200 M⊙.

On the binary parameters, since there are no obser-
vational constraints, we use the same distributions with
Pop I stars as ﬁducial ones, and adopt other distribu-
tions to see the parameter dependence. The mass ratio
distribution (MRD) is usually described by the power-
law n(q) ∝ qp, where q = m2/m1 is the mass ratio
between the secondary and primary of the binary sys-
tem. We adopt the power-law index of p = 0 or −1.
We note that the most of low-mass stars are born as
the secondary member of binary systems under these
MRDs with high-mass IMFs. For the period distribu-
tion, f (P ), of binaries, we use two observational results
by Duquennoy & Mayor (1991, hereafter DM91) for so-
lar neighbors and Rastegaev (2010, hereafter Ras10) for
Population II halo stars. In Ras10, close binaries with
short periods are more favored than in DM91. The mini-
mum separation of binaries is set at 1000R⊙ considering
the engulfment of the companion star by the massive pri-
mary star. We assume the circular orbit for simplicity.

The remnant mass, mrem, of a primary star is set
as a function of its initial mass, mi. For core collapse
SNe of mi = 8 - 50 M⊙, we adopt the theoretical results
for Pop III SNe by Woosley & Weaver (1995). We as-
sume that mrem = 0 for stars of mi = 140 - 260 M⊙,
which explode as pair-instability supernovae (OUSNe;

Fig. 2.— Distribution of the escaping velocity of stars from
mini-halos of 106 M⊙ at z = 20. The vertical axis is the normalized
number frequency. Solid, dashed, and dotted lines show the cases
of Mmd = 10 M⊙, 40 M⊙, and 200 M⊙.

Heger & Woosley 2002). Stars of mi = 50 - 140 M⊙ or
mi > 260 M⊙ are assumed to collapse into blackholes
without explosion.

Figure 1 shows the escape frequency as functions of
mini-halo mass. We plot the relative number of the es-
capees from mini-halos among low-mass (< 0.8 M⊙) sec-
ondary stars of binary systems. In the cases of the very
high-mass IMFs with Mmd & 40 M⊙, 10 − 20% of the
low-mass stars escape from mini-halos of 106 M⊙. The
escaped stars are the secondary members of close bina-
ries with periods smaller than a few hundred years. In
the case of Mmd = 10 M⊙, the escape frequency becomes
∼ 3% under the ﬂat MRD and z = 20. In this case, the
majority of Pop III survivors have intermediate-mass pri-
mary companions, and do not escape from binaries. The
higher Mmd usually increases the escape frequency due
to higher orbital velocity. In the case of Mmd = 200 M⊙,
however, due to the large fraction of primary stars of
mi = 50 - 140 M⊙, the escape probability is smaller than
the case of Mmd = 40 M⊙ at Mh . 106 M⊙. The bottom-
heavy MRD of p = −1 predicts a larger escape frequency
than the ﬂat one (p = 0) because the primary stars tend
to be more massive for the secondary stars of a given
mass. From more massive mini-halos with 108 M⊙, the
escape frequency is less than a few percent even with the
very high-mass IMF due to their deep gravitational po-
tential. As a conclusion, the escape fraction in Pop III
survivors is considerable from the low-mass mini-halos,
while for the massive mini-halos, the majority of Pop III
survivors remain in their host mini-halos.

After the star escapes from the mini-halo, its velocity

Figure 2 shows the distribution of vej
in the case of
Mh = 106 M⊙ and z = 20. The typical velocity is slightly
larger than the escape velocity of the mini-halo. The
high-velocity shoulder at vej ∼ 100 km s−1 in the case of
Mmd = 200 M⊙ is a contribution from the companions of
PISN, which eject all of the mass. The secondary com-
panion of a PISN has a large escaping velocity because
of its large orbital velocity for a given period.

3. THE NUMBER OF ESCAPED STARS

4

Komiya et al.

We compute the expected total number (Sec.3.2) of the
escaped Pop III and EMP survivors which are formed in
the building blocks of the MW.

We use the chemical evolution model with the hierar-
chical formation process of the MW taken into account
(Komiya et al. 2010, 2014, 2015). The basic feature and
input parameters of the code are described in Sec. 3.1.
We refer the readers to Komiya et al. (2014, 2015) for
more details about the treatment of chemical evolution.
In those studies, we have demonstrated that the model
reproduces the MDF and the distribution of r-process el-
ement abundances of EMP stars. In computing chemical
evolution, we register all the individual stars and bina-
ries with Z < 0.1 Z⊙. For each binary system, we set
a mass and orbital parameter according to the distribu-
tion functions, described above, and compute whether or
not the secondary star escapes. We describe the results
with the ﬁducial parameter set in Sec. 3.2 and discuss
the parameter dependence in Sec. 3.3.

3.1. Chemical Evolution Model

We build merger

trees using the method by
Somerville & Kolatt (1999) based on the EPS theory.
The total mass of the merger tree is MMW = 1012 M⊙.
We consider gas infall according to the dark matter infall
rate. At z < 10, we assume that the gas infall rate is zero
for mini-halos with virial temperatures of Tvir < 104K
because of the cosmic reionization.

The lower mass limit of mini-halos for star forma-
tion is set to give the minimum virial temperature of
Tvir,min = 103K (e.g. Tegmark et al. 1997; Yoshida et al.
2003). The star-formation rate, ψ,
is assumed to be
proportional to the gas mass, ψ = ǫ⋆Mgas, where ǫ⋆
is the star formation eﬃciency (SFE) and is set at
ǫ⋆ = 10−11yr−1 as a ﬁducial value. The mass, m, of
each metal-poor star is set randomly subject to the IMF
with a binary contribution. The assumptions about the
IMF and binary parameters are the same as described
in Section 2. We consider negative feedback to the star
formation with the following assumptions. A massive
Pop III star prohibits star formation in its host mini-
halo until it explodes. The Lyman–Werner background
radiation suppresses Pop III star formation in the mini-
halos of Tvir < 104K formed at z < zLW.

The SN yields and explosion energies are taken from
Kobayashi et al. (2006) and Umeda & Nomoto (2002)
for SNe II and for PISNe, respectively. We assume that
the chemical composition of each mini-halo is homoge-
neous. We consider gas outﬂow from mini-halos trig-
gered by individual SNe. The gas and metal outﬂow
rates are given as functions of the SN explosion energy
and the binding energy of the proto-galaxy. The out-
ﬂow matter from each mini-halo is assumed to form a
galactic wind. We follow the evolution of the regions
enriched with metals by galactic winds in the intergalac-
tic medium (IGM) assuming the momentum-conserving
snowplow shell model in spherical symmetry.

We summarize the ranges and ﬁducial values of pa-
rameters in Table 1. We adopt the parameter ranges
as wide as possible since no reliable knowledge is avail-
able about the formation rate, the IMF, the binary pa-
rameters, and the feedback process of Pop III stars.
The values of SFEs are varied from ǫ⋆ = 10−12yr−1
to 10−9yr−1. For the Lyman–Werner background, we

tions of stars in these mini-halos. After z < 10, the star formation
in small mini-halos stops due to the reionization.

adopt the parameter range between zLW = 15 to 30.
For the Pop III IMF, we explore the parameter depen-
dence with Mmd,Pop3 = 3 − 200 M⊙. For EMP stars,
we use Mmd,EMP = 10 M⊙ following our previous studies
(Komiya et al. 2007, 2009a).

3.2. The Escaped Pop III and EMP Stars

For each low-mass Pop III and Pop II binary with
Z < 0.1 Z⊙ in the chemical evolution model, we com-
pute whether or not the secondary star escapes from its
host mini-halo or not by the condition of eq. (1) and
count the number of escaping stars.

Figure 3 shows the formation redshift of Pop III and
EMP survivors, and the masses of their host mini-halos in
the case of the ﬁducial parameter set. The merger trees
with the total masses of 1012 M⊙ have more than 2 × 105
branches with Tvir > 103K. In the ﬁducial model, the
∼ 30, 000 - 50, 000 mini-halos formed before z = zLW =
20 involve Pop III stars. At z = 20, two-thirds of these
mini-halos are still metal-free and continue to form Pop
III stars. Star formation in mini-halos formed at z < 20
is suppressed due to the Lyman–Werner feedback. As
shown in Fig. 3, the vast majority of Pop III stars are
formed in mini-halos with Mh ∼ 106 M⊙ at z & 15. In
each star-forming mini-halo, one or two Pop III star(s)
or Pop III binaries are formed, and ∼ 5% of Pop III stars
have a low-mass secondary companion. As a result, the
number of low-mass Pop III survivors is 2800 - 3800 in
total. Among them, 100 - 170 stars escape from their
host mini-halos. At z ∼ 10, more massive (107 - 108 M⊙)
halos with pristine abundance form 120 to 220 low-mass
Pop III stars but their escape probability is very small.
Not only the Pop III stars but also the second and later
generations of stars can escape from mini-halos by the
same mechanism. Figure 4 shows the MDF of these mini-
halo escapees. In the ﬁducial model, a few percent of the
second or later generations of stars with [Fe/H] < −3
escape from host mini-halos. For [Fe/H] & −3, the es-
cape probability decreases since the masses of their host
mini-halos increase.

and
parameter

We summarize the parameter dependence of the pre-
dicted number, NescIII, of the escaped Pop III stars in
Figure 5.

As stated above, the ﬁducial model predicts 2800 - 3800
Pop III survivors in total, including the escaped and the

bounded ones. The number is mainly determined by the
IMF and the MRD of Pop III stars. The low median mass
(Mmd) and the small power-law index (p) of the MRD
favor low-mass star formation and increase the number
of Pop III survivors. On the other hand, high Mmd and
small p enhance the escape frequency, as described in
Sec. 2.

As seen in Fig. 5, NescIII decreases as Mmd increases
at Mmd > 10 M⊙ because the number of low-mass stars
decreases. On the other hand, the number is almost inde-
pendent of Mmd at Mmd ≤ 10 M⊙ because the number
of low-mass stars increases as Mmd decreases, but the
number of massive primary companion stars decreases.

In the case of p = −1, the escape fraction is ∼ 10
times larger than in the case of p = 0. With the period
distribution of Ras10, the value of NescIII becomes ∼
1.5 times larger compared with DM91 due to the large
frequency of close binaries with high orbital velocity. The
number of the escaped stars is simply proportional to the
binary fraction if the number of systems is ﬁxed.

The number of Pop III stars and the escape frequency
are also dependent on zLW and ǫ⋆. The high SFE makes
NescIII large since many stars are formed before mini-
halos grow in mass. If the Lyman–Werner feedback takes
place at very high redshift, e.g., z = 30, few Pop III
survivors escape since the star formation is suppressed
in most of low-mass mini-halos with Tvir < 104 K.

Under an optimistic parameter set as shown in Table 1,
approximately 10, 000 Pop III survivors escape from the
building blocks of the MW.

The number, NescEMP, of escaped EMP stars shows
the similar parameter dependence. We note that the
number of escaped Pop III stars is almost independent
of the parameters of EMP stars.

4. SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE ESCAPED

STARS

4.1. Model and Assumptions

We ﬁrst specify the spatial distribution of mini-halos
in the EPS merger trees under the spherical collapse ap-
proximation. We then compute the orbit of each escaped
star formed in the chemical evolution model and estimate
the distribution of escaped stars at z = 0. In this study,
we only deal with the evolution of the Galactocentric
distance of stars.

The radial component of the equation of motion for

the mini-halo escapees is written as follows,

where r∗ is the Galactocentric distance4 of an escaped
star, Min(r∗, t) is the total mass inside r∗ at time t, Λ
is the cosmological term, and l∗ is the speciﬁc angular
momentum of the star.

We assume that a main branch of the merger tree
(proto-MW) stays at the position where the MW is now
located. We take the initial distance when a star escapes
from a mini-halo to be the distance between the mini-
halo and the proto-MW. We estimate the distance, rn,
between the n-th mini-halo and the proto-MW based on
the EPS merger tree as follows (Komiya et al. 2015). The
Press–Schechter formalism considers the formation of a
halo by assuming the spherical collapse of a density per-
turbation. The evolution of the radius of the uniformly
overdense spherical region with mass M which collapses
at tc is given by integrating the following equation of
motion,

d2r(t)
dt2 = −

GM

r

+

Λc2

r,

(5)

with the initial and collapse conditions of r(0) = r(tc) =
0. As a corollary, the radius can be described as a func-
tion of t, M , and tc,

r = r(t|M, tc).

(6)

The EPS formalism considers the “merger” of two ha-
los as a gravitational collapse of a region incorporating
the two halos.
In this framework, the distance, rn, of
a mini-halo which merges with the proto-MW at time
tmerge,n may well be approximated to the radius, r, of
the region of the mass, M0(tmerge,n), of the proto-MW
at the time tmerge,n. In other words, we approximate the
Galactocentric distance, rn, of the n-th mini-halo as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)te

with M0(t) and tmerge,n are given by a merger tree.

The typical value of rn(te) is around 50 − 100kpc for

the progenitor mini-halos of the escaped Pop III stars.

The initial velocity of an escapee relative to the proto-
MW is given by the sum of the velocity of the escapee, vej,
relative to its host mini-halo in eq. (3) and the velocity
of the host mini-halo relative to the proto-MW at the
time, te, when the star escapes. The radial component
is written as

v∗(te) = vej cos θ +

drn(t)

dt

,

(8)

where θ is the angle of the escapee velocity to the radial
direction and is set random in the following.

The speciﬁc angular momentum of a star is set at

l∗ = rn(te)vej sin θ.

(9)

The escaping velocities of Pop III stars are around vej ∼
30 km s−1, as shown in Fig. 2. The averaged speciﬁc
angular momentum of Pop III survivors is ∼ 1200kpc ·
km s−1 in the ﬁducial model. We neglect the tangential
proper motion of mini-halos. A numerical study shows
that dark matter sub-halos have speciﬁc angular momen-
tum of 0.51RvirVc on average, where Rvir is a virial radius
and Vc is the circular velocity of a primary halo when a
sub-halo falls into the virial radius (Jiang et al. 2008).

realization with the ﬁducial parameter set. The Galactocentric
distance is plotted as functions of time. Black dashed line denotes
the virial radius of the main branch of the merger tree (proto-MW).

Given that the angular momentum grows approximately
linearly with time until a mini-halo separates from the
Hubble ﬂow (e.g. Peacock 1999), the angular momentum
of mini-halos at te is smaller (∼ 500 kpc · km s−1) than
rnvej sin θ for the majority of the escaped Pop III stars
due to high redshift when Pop III stars escape.

We also neglect the change of radial velocity and angu-
lar momentum of the escaped stars by encounters with
satellite halos since the event rate for close encounters
with mini-halos other than the proto-MW is smaller than
unity, as shown in the Appendix.

For the mass, Min(r∗, t), inside r∗, we use the following

where Rvir,0(t) is the virial radius of the proto-MW
and rMW(t) is the radius of the overdense region which
collapses to the present MW. Inside the virial radius
r∗ < Rvir,0(t), we adopt the NFW density proﬁle. We
put rMW(t) equal to r(t|MMW, tuniv) in eq. (6) with tuniv,
the age of the universe at z = 0. Outside this radius,
rMW(t) < r∗, we assume the average density, ρav, of the
universe. At the intermediate distance range between
Rvir,0(t) and rMW(t), Min is the sum of the mass of all the
mini-halos with r < r∗ in a merger tree and IGM inside
r∗. We estimate the mass from eq. (5) and the merger
tree as follows. A mass element at distance r at time
t moves following eq.(5) and accretes to the proto-MW
at tc. Mass inside this orbit is M0(tc). In other words,
we can give tc(r, t) as a function of r and t by solving
r = r(t|M0(tc), tc) for tc numerically. Under the spheri-
cal collapse approximation, the mini-halos and IGM in-
side r at t accrete to proto-MW before tc(r, t). Therefore,
we can approximate the total mass inside r∗ at t as the
mass of a proto-MW at tc, i.e., M0(tc(r∗, t)).

4.2. Results

We follow the motion of all mini-halo escapees from te
to tuniv. Figure 6 shows the variation of the radial dis-
tance of the escaped Pop III stars in one computational

of all the mini-halo escapees (solid red histogram) and the escaped
Pop III stars (dashed bﬂue histogram) for the ﬁducial model. The

the maximum and minimum values for 10 realizations. The thin
green histogram denotes the results with merger trees without a

the NFW proﬁle and the Einasto proﬁle, respectively, ﬁtted to

power-law ﬁt to the observed density proﬁle of the stellar halo,
which declines with a power-law index of −3.8 (Sesar et al. 2011),

realization with the ﬁducial parameter set. A majority
of escapees fall into the MW halo at a few to 10 Gyrs
after the escape.

The progenitor mini-halos of the MW are distributed
in ∼ 80kpc at z = 20 and ∼ 150 kpc at z = 10. The ve-

locity of these mini-halos by Hubble ﬂow is ∼ 300 km s−1
at z = 20 and ∼ 200 km s−1 at z = 10. On the other
hand, the escaping velocity (vej) of stars from mini-halos
is vej . 60 km s−1, as shown in Figure 2. Therefore,
most of the “escaped” stars cannot get the enough ve-
locity to escape from the MW. The cosmological term is
negligible.

Figure 7 shows the distributions of the escaped Pop III
stars on the r∗(te)-r∗(tuniv) plane (top panel) and the vej-
r∗(tuniv) plane. There is a clear gap at r∗(tuniv) ∼ 300–
600 kpc. Stars that fell onto the MW halo are distributed
inside or slightly outside the virial radius (260 kpc) of the
MW halo. For the stars at r∗(tuniv) < 300 kpc, we see
a clear positive correlation of the present radial distance
with the initial radial diatance (top panel), but no cor-
relation with the escaping velocity (bottom panel). The
motion of these stars is mainly dominated by the Hub-
ble ﬂow and the gravity of the proto-MW. On the other
hand, for stars with r∗(tuniv) & 600 kpc, the present
distance, r∗(tuniv), is dependent on vej. Their host mini-
halos were distant from the proto-MW when they es-
caped. These stars are not bounded to the MW and will
be ﬂoating in the intergalactic space with nearly constant
velocity.

Figure 8 shows the predicted spatial distribution of the
escaped Pop III survivors (dashed blue lines) and all the
mini-halo escapees (solid red line) at the present for the
ﬁducial model. The distributions are peaked at ∼ 100
kpc, the outer region of the MW’s dark halo. 20–30%
of escapees spread further outward in the intergalactic
space outside the MW, and are distributed beyond ∼ 1
Mpc away from the MW.

We can ﬁt the distribution of escaped stars by the
NFW proﬁle or the Einasto proﬁle. In Fugure 8, we plot
the NFW proﬁle with the scale radius rs = 11kpc and
the Einasto proﬁle with the shape parameter α = 0.16
and rs = 11kpc. These parameter values are comparable
with those of the MW mass halos in numerical simula-
tions (e.g., Tissera et al. 2010). The distribution of all
the escaped stars well agrees with these proﬁles at the
radius r . 300 kpc, while it grows much smaller beyond
this radius.

In comparison, the Pop III escapees exhibit slightly
more centrally condensed distribution than the EMP es-
capees. This may stem from the diﬀerence in the ratio
of vej to the velocity of the Hubble ﬂow; it is larger for
the EMP escapees because of the decrease in the Hubble
ﬂow, which renders the spread of initial velocity larger.
The magenta line denotes the distribution under the
optimistic parameter set. The distance distribution is
almost independent of the IMF, the binary parameters,
and the SFE, while the number of escaped Pop III stars
is dependent on them.

The predicted distribution is slightly dependent on the
merging history of a galaxy. Galaxy formation studies
indicate that disk-dominated galaxies such as the MW
experienced no major mergers at low redshift. We select
merger trees with M0(z = 2) > 0.75 × MMW, and show
the result with these trees as a green line in Figure 8. In
this case, the distribution of mini-halos is more centrally
concentrated at the formation epoch of Pop III or EMP
stars. The predicted distribution of the escaped stars at
z = 0 is also slightly shifted toward the MW center. In

show the results of the ﬁducial model and the optimistic model, re-
spectively. For the total number of HMP stars, we adopt the result
of Komiya et al. (2015) under the polluted Pop III star scenario for
HMP stars. The spatial distribution of the HMP stars is assumed
to be the same with the stellar halo.

parameter sets, respectively.

particular, only 6]-10 % of the escaped stars is outside
the virial radius and the number of stars at r∗ > 600 kpc
is very small.

5. OBSERVABILITY

In this section, we compare the predicted distribution
of escaped Pop III stars with the distribution of ﬁeld halo
stars, and discuss a strategy to search for the escaped
Pop III stars.

The number frequency of the escapees among the
Pop III stars is ∼ 3% in the ﬁducial model, as stated in
Sec. 3.2. This frequency is dependent on the Galactocen-
tric distance. As stated above, the predicted distribution
of mini-halo escapees is similar to the dark matter halo
and more extended than the stellar halo. The observed
density proﬁle of the MW stellar halo at the solar vicinity
is ﬁtted by ρ ∝ r−3. Recent observations have found that
the stellar density declines more rapidly beyond 25 − 30
kpc with a power-law index of −3.8 (Sesar et al. 2011),
−4.5 (Watkins et al. 2009), or −4.6 (Deason et al. 2011),
as shown in thin solid black lines in Figure 8. Numeri-
cal studies for the formation of a stellar halo also predict
a power-law index with −3 to −4 (Bullock & Johnston
2005; Font et al. 2011).

In Figure 9, we plot the predicted number ratio be-
tween the escaped Pop III stars and the HMP stars
against the Galactocentric distance. As mentioned
above, we assume that the Pop III stars that remain in
the host mini-halos undergo the surface pollution to be
observed as HMP stars (Komiya et al. 2009a, 2015). It
is shown that one-third of the polluted Pop III stars are
distributed at [Fe/H] < −5 in our model. For the spatial
distribution of HMP stars, we adopt the density proﬁle
of the MW stellar halo derived by Watkins et al. (2009)
from the observation of RR Lyrae stars;

n(r) ∝ (cid:26)r−2.4

r−4.5

(r < 23kpc)
(r > 23kpc).

(11)

We extrapolate this power-law proﬁle from the MW cen-
ter to the virial radius since their observational sample
is limited to the distance of 5 < r < 115 kpc.

The red and blue lines show the result for the ﬁducial
model and the optimistic model, respectively. At r . 20

kpc, the number ratio between the escaped Pop III stars
and the HMP stars is ∼ 1/25 for the ﬁducial case and
∼ 1/5 for the optimistic case. The frequency of escaped
Pop III stars increases in the outer halo. At r ≃ 100 kpc,
the expected number of escaped Pop III stars grows com-
parable to that of HMP stars. Observationally, two HMP
stars are found in the sample of the HES survey, and
three additional HMP stars are discovered by later ob-
servations. The absence of metal-free stars in the current
samples is consistent with the predicted low frequency of
escaped Pop III survivors among nearby stars. Our result
indicates that a survey of the outskirt of the MW halo
or a survey of nearby halo stars with a 10 times larger
sample volume than the HES survey may ﬁnd pristine
Pop III star(s).

In Figure 10, we give the predicted apparent magnitude
distribution of the escaped Pop III survivors. The solid
and dashed black lines correspond to the results of the
ﬁducial and the optimistic models, respectively. The col-
ored lines show the number of stars at diﬀerent evolution-
ally stages in the ﬁducial model. We assume the averaged
absolute magnitudes of MV = 3.0, 0.5, −0.3 and −2.0, re-
spectively, for the Pop III survivors during the subgiant,
the red giant, the horizontal branch and the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) phases based on the stellar evolu-
tion calculation of Pop III stars with 0.8 M⊙ (Suda et al.
2010). The duration of each evolutionary phase is taken
into consideration as the corresponding mass ranges of
∆m = 0.1 M⊙, 0.01 M⊙, 0.005 M⊙, and 0.001 M⊙, re-
spectively. For main-sequence stars, we adopt the mass-
luminosity relation L = (m/ M⊙)3.5 × L⊙. We set the
Galactocentric distance of the solar system at 8kpc. The
ﬁgure indicates that the majority of escaped Pop III stars
in the RGB phase have apparent magnitudes brighter
than V ∼ 20mag.

If we adopt 4 × 108 M⊙ for the total mass of the MW
stellar halo (Bell et al. 2008) and the IMF of Chabrier
(2003), the number ratio between the escaped Pop III
stars and the ﬁeld halo stars is 1/1,000,000 in the ﬁdu-
cial case and 1/30,000 in the optimistic case. If we ob-
serve RGB stars at MV = 19 − 21, however, the num-
ber fraction of the escaped Pop III stars among the halo
stars amounts to ∼ 1/40, 000 for the ﬁducial model and

Fig. 11.— Number fraction of the escaped Pop III stars among
stars with [Fe/H] < −3 for red giants (red) or subgiant stars (blue).
We plot the fraction for three apparent magnitude ranges of V = 15
- 17 mag, 17 - 19 mag, and 19 - 21 mag. Open squares and ﬁlled
circles show results for the ﬁducial and optimistic parameter sets,
respectively.

∼ 1/1000 for the optimistic model. A multi-object spec-
trograph can be a useful tool to select candidates of the
mini-halo escapees. For example, the Prime Focus Spec-
trograph as a next generation instrument of the Subaru
telescope will carry out the spectroscopy of 2400 targets
within 1.3 degree diameter. It may reach to V = 21 mag
by 2 hr exposure with the resolution R = 3000. We can
select red giant EMP star candidates from the spectro-
scopic data provided by such an instrument.

In order to sort out the EMP stars and the Pop III
stars from candidate stars, high-resolution spectroscopic
observations are required. Figure 11 shows the number
fraction of escaped Pop III survivors among stars with
[Fe/H] < −3 as a function of the apparent magnitude.
We plot the number fraction among red giants (red) and
the subgiant stars (blue) in our ﬁducial (open square)
and optimistic (ﬁlled circle) models. About 1% of red
giant stars with 19 – 21 mag are the escaped Pop III
stars for the ﬁducial model. For the optimistic model, the
majority of RGB stars with 19−21 mag are the mini-halo
escapees, and ∼ 4% of them are escaped Pop III stars.
The reason for the depression at 17 – 19 mag for the
subgiant stars in this ﬁgure is that stars around the MW
center fall in this magnitude range.
If we target stars
in the high galactic latitude area, the fraction of Pop III
stars is almost ﬂat against magnitude at . 20mag for the
subgiant stars since the number fraction against distance
is almost ﬂat at ∼ 20 kpc, as shown in Fig. 9.

This ﬁgure indicates that the follow up observation
with high-resolution spectroscopy for several dozens of
RGB stars with [Fe/H] < −3 at a magnitude range
of V = 19 − 21 gives us a chance to ﬁnd a few es-
caped Pop III survivors. These faint Pop III or EMP
stars can be targets for a high-resolution spectroscopy
using the Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) or the Euro-
pean Extremely-Large Telescope (E-ELT).

We note that these Pop III stars show the enhance-
ments of carbon and nitrogen abundances, and also of
oxygen abundance but to a much lesser degree, during
the horizontal branch and the AGB phases. Low-mass
Pop III stars undergo the proton ignition into the he-
lium convection during the core helium ﬂash,
ignited
at the tip of RGB (Fujimoto et al. 1990), and helium-
ﬂash-driven deep mixing occurs to dredge up the nuclear

products of helium ﬂash to their surfaces (Hollowell et al.
1990; Fujimoto et al. 2000; Suda et al. 2004, 2010;
Campbell & Lattanzio 2008; Campbell et al. 2010).
It
may also enhance s-process elements (Fujimoto et al.
2000; Iwamoto et al. 2004). On the other hand, no mech-
anisms are known to enhance iron group elements in
Pop III escapees.

As shown in Figure 8, we predict that some stars are
expelled into the intergalactic space at a distance of ∼ 1
Mpc. Accordingly, we may also observe the Pop III and
EMP stars that are ejected into intergalactic space from
the Andromeda galaxy in the same way around the MW.
When we assume that the mass of the Andromeda galaxy
is 1.5 × 1012 M⊙, the expected number of stars which
vir,0(tuniv)/4πd2) ∼
come to the MW is 1.5NescEMP(πR2
10 in the ﬁducial case and ∼ 700 in the optimistic case,
where d = 780kpc is the distance of the Andromeda
galaxy. These stars becomes hypervelocity stars with
the velocities exceeding the escape velocity, and have a
possibility of being observed by the Gaia satellite.

The existence of escaped stars in intergalactic space
may also support the hierarchical formation scenario of
galaxies. In addition, the number ratio between Pop III
stars inside and outside the MW halo can provide a con-
straint on the merging history of the MW, as shown in
Figure 8. It is presently diﬃcult, however, to ﬁnd such
stars since they are very faint even at the giant phases
(∼ 26 mag for RGB and ∼ 23 mag for AGB).

6. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

In this paper, we have estimated the escape probability
of low-mass Pop III stars from mini-halos in which they
are formed. Since Pop III stars are formed in halos with
very small masses (∼ 106 M⊙), a few to 20%, depending
on model parameters, of low-mass Pop III stars in bina-
ries are expected to escape when their primaries explode
as SNe. While surfaces of Pop III survivors that remain
bounded in mini-halos can be polluted by accreting sur-
rounding gas with metals, the escaped Pop III stars can
keep the surface in the pristine chemical composition.

From the mini-halos as building blocks of the Milky
Way (MW), a few hundred Pop III survivors can escape
if we adopt the high-mass IMF and assume the same
binary parameter distribution as Population I stars. The
number of such stars depends on the IMF, the MRD, the
star-formation rate, and the eﬃciency of the negative
feedback on Pop III star formation.
In the case of an
optimistic parameter set, we predict tens of thousands of
the escaped Pop III stars.

We also compute the orbits of escaped Pop III stars to
see their spatial distribution. Most of the escaped stars
fall back onto the dark matter halo of the MW and are
distributed around 100 kpc away from the MW center.
The predicted distribution proﬁle is similar to the density
proﬁle of the dark matter halo.

It is conceivable that the surface of an escaped Pop III
star is polluted by ejecta from a SN explosion of its pri-
mary companion. However, a numerical simulation of
the interaction between SN ejecta and a companion star
shows that SN ejecta is not retained in the secondary
star since the surface of the secondary star is stripped by
shock heating (e.g. Hirai et al. 2014).

A gravitational slingshot in star clusters is another
mechanism by which to escape from mini-halos, which

10

Komiya et al.

is not considered in this work. Recent numerical simula-
tions of Pop III star formation show that a half of low-
mass Pop III stars can escape from their host mini-halos
with velocities of several to hundreds of km s−1 through
gravitational multi-body interaction (Greif et al. 2011;
Stacy & Bromm 2013). The expected number of the es-
caped Pop III stars in this channel can be similar to or
larger than our optimistic model. On the other hand,
the distance and magnitude distribution of the escaped
Pop III stars are expected to be similar in both channels
since the velocity of the escapees by gravitational sling-
shot is similar to the escaped stars from SN binaries.

We have a chance to observe escaped Pop III stars
by a large-scale survey of giant stars in the outskirts
of the MW. The predicted number density of escaped
Pop III stars is comparable to HMP stars at a distance
of ∼ 100kpc, the latter of which remain in their host
mini-halos and are subject to the surface pollution by the

accretion of interstellar gas. We expect that the number
fraction of the escaped Pop III stars becomes 1/1000 –
1/40,000 among halo RGB stars in the range of 19 –
21 mag. Multi-object spectrographs such as the Sub-
aru Prime Focus Spectrograph can be a useful tool for
selecting extremely metal-poor objects as candidates of
Pop III stars. Follow up observations of high-resolution
spectroscopy for several dozens of EMP stars in the out-
skirts of the MW using the TMT or E-ELT will provide
a chance to identify Pop III survivors.

Observation of stars with zero surface metallicity
would be a smoking gun for low-mass star formation in a
zero-metallicity environment. The existence of such low-
mass Pop III stars supports the scenario that HMP stars
are polluted Pop III stars. If Pop III stars are mainly
distributed in the very outer region of the MW, it indi-
cates that HMP stars are polluted counterparts in the
stellar halo of the MW.

APPENDIX

ENCOUNTER WITH SATELLITE HALOS

In section 4, we neglect the contribution from mini-halos other than the main branch of the merger tree in computing
the orbits of the escapees from mini-halos. Here, we show that it is negligible that the escaped Pop III stars are trapped
or scattered by other mini-halos other than the proto-MW.

The orbit of an escaped star is signiﬁcantly changed by a mini-halo if the gravitational potential of the mini-halo is

larger than the kinetic energy, i.e., the impact parameter, b, is smaller than bm as deﬁned by the following equation

|φh(bm|Mh, z)| =

1
2

v2
rel,

(A1)

where φh(r|Mh, z) is the gravitational potential at a distance r from the center of a halo at redshift z with mass Mh,
and vrel is the relative velocity of a star and the mini-halo. For the gravitational potential, we use the NFW proﬁle at
r ≤ rvir and φh = GMh/r at r > rvir, where rvir is the virial radius of the mini-halo. In the case of mini-halo escapees,
vrel is similar to vej. The cross section of the close encounter is σ = πb2

m(z(t), Mh, vrel).

The frequency of encounter is described as follows

Z tuni

te

dtZ Mmax

Mmin

dMh

dn
dMh

(Mh, z(t))σ(t, Mh, vrel)vrel,

(A2)

where dn/dMh is the number density of halos of mass between Mh and Mh + dMh, and given by the Press–Schechter
theory. We adopt te = 0.2 Gyr from the results of our hierarchical chemical evolution model and Mmax = 1010 M⊙,
which is the dark halo mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Mmin is set at a value so that bm(z, Mmin, vrel) = 0 is
satisﬁed. For vrel = 10, 30, 100 km s−1, the encounter rate is 0.015, 0.00057, and 0.000012, respectively. Massive halos
are dominant contributors due to their large cross section. Even when Mmax = 1011 M⊙, the encounter rate is 0.0042
for vrel = 30 km s−1.

After the escaped stars fall onto the dark halo of the MW, they move around the MW with several hundred km s−1.
The kinematic energy of these stars is larger than the gravitational potential of sub-halos of the MW, and the cross
section is zero.
