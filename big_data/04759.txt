SOME PROPERTIES OF OPTIMAL FUNCTIONS

FOR SPHERE PACKING IN DIMENSIONS 8 AND 24

HENRY COHN AND STEPHEN D. MILLER

Abstract. We study some sequences of functions of one real variable and
conjecture that they converge uniformly to functions with certain positivity
and growth properties. Our conjectures imply a conjecture of Cohn and Elkies,
which in turn implies the complete solution to the sphere packing problem
in dimensions 8 and 24. We give numerical evidence for these conjectures as
well as some arithmetic properties of the hypothetical limiting functions. The
conjectures are of greatest interest in dimension 24, in light of Viazovska’s
recent solution to the Cohn-Elkies conjecture (and consequently the sphere
packing problem) in dimension 8.

1. Introduction

One of the fundamental problems in geometry is to determine the densest sphere
packing in Euclidean space. In other words, how large a fraction of Rn can be
covered by equal-sized, non-overlapping balls? The answer is known so far only for
n ≤ 3 (see [FT] and [H]), and very recently for n = 8 as well [V]. A remarkable
feature of this problem is that each dimension has its own idiosyncrasies. Even
setting aside the issue of proofs, the best packings known do not seem to follow any
simple pattern.

Perhaps the most striking packings are those formed by centering spheres at
the points of the E8 root lattice and the Leech lattice. Both have been known
for some years now to be the densest lattice packings in their dimensions. The
E8 case was proved by Blichfeldt in his 1935 paper [B], and the Leech lattice case
was proved by Cohn and Kumar in [CK3] (see also [CK1]). The latter work was
based on an analytic approach introduced in [CE] by Cohn and Elkies, who in fact
studied the general sphere packing problem (including non-lattice packings, which
may improve on the density of lattice packings in some dimensions). Cohn and
Elkies proved that E8 and the Leech lattice are optimal among all sphere packings
if there exist functions from R to R satisfying certain sign and regularity conditions;
they furthermore conjectured that such functions do indeed exist. In this paper we
introduce explicit sequences of functions which we conjecture converge to functions
satisfying the Cohn-Elkies conditions. (We of course note that the n = 8 case of the
Cohn-Elkies conjecture was solved in [V].)

Our functions depend on a parameter n, the dimension of the sphere packing
problem. One advantage of our approach is that our conjectures appear to hold for
a broader range of values of n, not only for n = 8 and n = 24. Although they have
no sphere packing implications except in those two cases, existence might be easier

to prove because they no longer depend on delicate facts about these particular
dimensions.

A second advantage is that our approach does not rely on numerical optimization.
By contrast, the Leech lattice optimality proof makes use of a carefully optimized
polynomial of degree 803 with 3000-digit coeﬃcients. The computer-assisted proof in
[CK3] reads this polynomial from a ﬁle and veriﬁes that it has the desired properties
to complete the proof, but there is no conceptual description of the polynomial or
simple method to construct it from scratch. (It was found by combining numerous
ad hoc techniques to locate a starting point from which Newton’s method would
converge.) Using our approach, one could replace this complicated polynomial with
a polynomial that has a much simpler description. That would not remove the need
for computer veriﬁcation of its properties, but it is a step towards simplifying the
proof.

Our lack of need for optimization also enables us to carry out much larger
computations than in previous papers. For example, we arrive at density bounds
that are sharp to over ﬁfty decimal places in R8 and R24, compared with the fourteen
and twenty-nine decimal places from [CK3]. Strictly speaking our new bounds are
not theorems, because we have not bothered to verify them using exact arithmetic,
but our ﬂoating point calculations leave no reasonable doubt. We are conﬁdent that
the approach from Appendix A in [CK3] could be used to provide a proof (should a
rigorous bound be needed for some purpose).

The results of these large calculations display intricate and surprising structure.
Most interestingly, in Section 5 we ﬁnd that the second Taylor coeﬃcients appear
to be rational. If the pattern governing the higher coeﬃcients could be identiﬁed,
it would yield a direct construction by power series of functions satisfying the
Cohn-Elkies conjecture.

In the next section we review background from [CE]. Our functions are introduced
in Section 3. In Section 4, we provide experimental evidence that our sequences of
functions are converging rapidly (despite the failure of a related, naive construction),
and we study this numerical data in detail. In Section 5 we examine the Taylor
coeﬃcients and values of the Mellin transform of the optimal functions, both of
which exhibit some unexplained rationality properties. In Section 6 we study the
closely related problem of potential energy minimization. Finally we conclude in
Section 7 by describing some related but simpler sequences of functions, which serve
as a testing ground for our main conjectures.

(cid:104)t, x(cid:105) ∈ Z for all x ∈ Λ} its dual, and |Λ| = vol(Rn/Λ) its covolume.

Our primary connection between sphere packing and Fourier analysis is the

following theorem of Cohn and Elkies (Theorem 3.1 in [CE]; see also [C1]):
Theorem 2.1. Suppose there exists an admissible function f : Rn → R and a
constant r such that

(1) f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) (cid:54)= 0,
(3) (cid:98)f (t) ≥ 0 for all t.

(2) f (x) ≤ 0 for |x| ≥ r, and

Then every sphere packing in Rn has density at most

As usual (n/2)! is to be interpreted as Γ(n/2 + 1) when n is odd. The density of

a sphere packing refers to the fraction of space covered by the packing.

We will brieﬂy explain how to prove Theorem 2.1 using Poisson summation,

because the conditions for a sharp bound will be important later in the paper.

Proof. First, we give the proof for lattice packings, after which we will sketch the
general proof.
Suppose Λ ⊂ Rn is a lattice. We can assume without loss of generality that the
minimal nonzero vector length in Λ is r, because sphere packing density is invariant
under scaling. That amounts to using balls of radius r/2 in the sphere packing.

By Poisson summation, (cid:88)
Applying the inequalities on f and (cid:98)f yields

Thus,

|Λ| ≥ 1.

In other words, there is at most one lattice point per unit volume in Rn. It follows
that the density is at most the volume of a sphere of radius r/2, i.e.,

(because the density equals the volume of a sphere times the number of spheres per
unit volume in space).

For the general case, one can assume without loss of generality that the sphere
packing is periodic, i.e., a union of translates of a lattice packing. Suppose it is the
disjoint union of Λ + v1, . . . , Λ + vn. Then applying the identity

which follows from Poisson summation and some manipulation, completes the proof
(cid:3)
as above.

One can weaken the hypothesis of admissibility in this theorem, at the cost of
complicating the proof (see Proposition 9.3 in [CK2], which is set in the more general
context of potential energy minimization, or the proof in [CZ2], which does not
even use Poisson summation). However, the applications in this paper will use only
admissible functions.

Unfortunately, Theorem 2.1 does not address the issue of how to ﬁnd functions f
that lead to good sphere packing bounds (i.e., that minimize r). Doing so amounts
to grappling with an inﬁnite-dimensional optimization problem, which has a simple
solution when n = 1 but is unsolved and appears diﬃcult for n > 1. Cohn and
Elkies performed a computer search to locate explicit functions that improve on
the previously known density upper bounds for 4 ≤ n ≤ 36. (For 4 ≤ n ≤ 7 and
n = 9, a reﬁnement of this approach from [LOV] yields slightly better bounds.)
These functions are probably nearly optimal in terms of minimizing the values r
achieved by functions satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1. However, in most
cases these bounds are still far above the densities of the best packings known.

The most remarkable application of Theorem 2.1 occurs when the dimension
n is 8 or 24. In those dimensions, Cohn and Elkies found functions that come
tantalizingly close to solving the sphere packing problem completely. Using more
sophisticated search techniques, Cohn and Kumar [CK3] later achieved a bound
within a factor of 1 + 1.65 × 10−30 of the conjectured optimum for n = 24 and a
factor of 1 + 10−14 for n = 8. Typically it is harder to get more accurate bounds for
larger values of n; the reason the bound for n = 24 is so much better is that Cohn
and Kumar required that level of accuracy for their application and thus devoted
much more computer time to optimizing this case.

One may ask whether the functions produced by these computer searches asymp-
totically produce a sharp sphere packing bound in these dimensions. That appears
to be true, and Cohn and Elkies conjectured an even stronger statement, namely
that the sphere packing problem in dimensions 2, 8, and 24 can be solved exactly
by the use of a single function f in Theorem 2.1:

Conjecture 2.2 (Conjecture 7.3 in [CE]; now a theorem when n = 8 [V]). When
n ∈ {2, 8, 24}, there exists a function f satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 2.1
with

gives an optimal function for use in Theorem 2.1. At ﬁrst glance it may seem quite
unlikely that Theorem 2.1 leads to a sharp sphere packing bound in any other
dimension n > 1. For example, positivity arguments such as its proof (which involve
dropping a number of terms to get an inequality) nearly always lose information; in
analytic number theory it is essentially a given that they will not produce sharp
results.

PROPERTIES OF OPTIMAL FUNCTIONS

Despite this, there is ample numerical evidence that Conjecture 2.2 is true in
the special dimensions n = 2, 8 (where it was proved in [V]), and 24. Similarly
sharp solutions have been found for related problems in R2, R8, and R24 such as the
kissing problem (see [Lev, OS]), and there are many analogies with error-correcting
codes (see, for example, [CZ1]).

The main purpose of this paper is to introduce explicit sequences which we
conjecture converge to functions satisfying Conjecture 2.2. We will focus on n = 8
and 24, not only because these cases are more interesting, but also because they
appear to be more similar to each other than either is to the n = 2 case.

3. Explicit functions

The conditions on f in Theorem 2.1 are radially symmetric, so any function
satisfying them can be rotationally symmetrized. Thus, without loss of generality
we will assume that f is a radial function, and we will sometimes write f (r) for the
common value f (x) with |x| = r. A convenient family of functions to consider are
products of polynomials with Gaussians. If we write
f (x) = p(|x|2)e−π|x|2

(3.1)

with p a polynomial, then a calculation shows

(cid:98)f (t) = (T p)(|t|2)e−π|t|2

(3.2)

that

for some polynomial T p depending on p. In other words, T is the linear map given
by

(T p)(|t|2) = eπ|t|2(cid:90)

e−2πi(cid:104)x,t(cid:105) dx,

Rn

f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) = 1

which one can check maps polynomials to polynomials.

The functions f used in [CE] are of the form (3.1). They are created by requiring

and also that f and (cid:98)f must have forced single and double roots at certain locations.

Together these can be interpreted as a set of linear conditions satisﬁed by the
coeﬃcients of the polynomial p, which can be solved when the degree of p is
appropriately large compared to the number of forced roots. Cohn and Elkies used
a computer search to choose locations for these forced roots in order to optimize
the sphere packing bound obtained from Theorem 2.1.

This procedure works well in practice, but it is diﬃcult to analyze. It is not at
all obvious that these successively optimized functions f (coming from polynomials
of higher and higher degree) even converge to a locally optimal choice of f , let
alone the global optimum. The numerical evidence is compelling, but a proof is
completely lacking.

In this paper, we examine a simpler variant of this approach. Instead of carefully
optimizing the forced root locations, we specify them a priori. Specifying the roots
is worse in practice, but not much worse: for example, using 200 roots we will come
within a factor of 1 + 1.23 × 10−27 of the Leech lattice’s density, compared with
1 + 1.65× 10−30 in [CK3] using 200 carefully optimized roots. Because our functions
are explicit and do not involve a computer search, they can be computed more
quickly and may be easier to analyze.

In order to describe where and why we force roots of f and (cid:98)f , it is helpful to

recall the proof of Theorem 2.1. There we proved the inequality

length is r.) For this scaling of Λ, the terms f (x) and (cid:98)f (t) must vanish whenever

Λ is actually the densest sphere packing in Rn, and if this method proves a sharp
bound, then both inequalities must actually be equalities. For that to happen, one
must ﬁrst have |Λ| = 1. (Recall that in the proof, we scaled Λ so its minimal vector
x ∈ Λ(cid:54)=0 and t ∈ Λ∗

(cid:54)=0. In other words,

(3.3)

f must vanish at all nonzero vector lengths, and

(cid:98)f must vanish at all nonzero dual vector lengths.

In order to preserve the sign constraints (2) and (3) from Theorem 2.1, the order of
vanishing at every vector length must be even, with the exception of f (x) at |x| = r,
where a sign change should in fact occur.

Note that even if one did not assume that f is radial, it would still vanish on
concentric spheres through the lattice points, not simply at the individual lattice
points. This is because the above argument applies not only to Λ, but to any
rotation of it; consequently, f must vanish at each rotated lattice point.
Table 1 lists the lengths of nonzero vectors in the optimal lattices in dimensions
1, 2, 8, and 24 (scaled so that |Λ| = 1, which is the usual scaling except in R2); these
lattices are undoubtedly the densest sphere packings in their respective dimensions,
but of course this has not been proved in 8 or 24 dimensions. For each of these
lattices, the dual vector lengths are the same as the vector lengths: in each case
except dimension 2, Λ∗ = Λ, and in dimension 2, Λ∗ is a rotation of Λ.

One naive approach to constructing optimal functions would be to force roots at
exactly these locations. Speciﬁcally, let r1 < r2 < . . . be the nonzero vector lengths
in the last column of Table 1. (In other words, r1 =
2 if n = 8 and r1 = 2 if
n = 24, etc.) For any integer k ≥ 1 we deﬁne the function fk(x) to be of the form
(3.1), with p(x) = qk(x) a polynomial of degree 4k − 1, subject to the following 4k
constraints:

√

(3.4)

fk(0) = 1,
fk(x) vanishes to order 1 at |x| = r1,
fk(x) vanishes to order 2 at |x| = r2, . . . , rk, and

(cid:98)fk(x) vanishes to order 2 at |x| = r1, . . . , rk.

Such a function is designed to satisfy the requirements of (3.3) and thereby be used
in Theorem 2.1. However condition (1) of the theorem has not been addressed; i.e.,

we have not forced (cid:98)fk(0) = 1 as well. This condition in fact holds automatically for
the limit f of the functions fk, provided it exists; the reason is that f and (cid:98)f vanish
(cid:98)f (0) = f (0) = 1. If one wishes to use the functions fk themselves to prove sphere

at all non-zero lattice points, and Poisson summation over the lattice Λ implies

packing bounds, then one must rescale them to force condition (1) to hold. This
rescaling changes the bound to

(cid:16) r1
(i.e., it introduces a factor of fk(0)/(cid:98)fk(0)).

Unfortunately, this sequence of functions fails, at ﬁrst subtly and then dramati-
cally: the functions do not converge as k → ∞, and for suﬃciently large k they do
not even prove packing bounds at all (because they develop unwanted sign changes).
See Section 4 for a discussion of the numerical evidence.

Instead of using the exact vector lengths in the deﬁnition of fk, we modify them
as follows. Let (cid:96)m denote the actual m-th vector length. Given k, we deﬁne modiﬁed
root locations r1, . . . , rk (depending on k) as follows:

(cid:16) m−(cid:98)2k/3(cid:99)

k−(cid:98)2k/3(cid:99)

(cid:17)2

if m < (cid:98)2k/3(cid:99), and
if (cid:98)2k/3(cid:99) ≤ m ≤ k.

In other words, the ﬁrst two-thirds of the root locations are left unchanged, while the
squares of the others are perturbed by a quadratically growing amount culminating
in making the ﬁnal one 25% larger. The numbers 2/3 and 1/4 in (3.5) are somewhat
arbitrary, but these choices appear to work well in practice. The rescaling (3.5)
was motivated by the empirical location of the roots of the optimized functions of
particular degrees mentioned earlier, as well as the similar spacing of large roots of
orthogonal polynomials (see [D]).

We can now use these modiﬁed root locations to deﬁne functions fk. Unlike the
naive deﬁnition using (cid:96)m, the improved deﬁnition using rm appears to work well. In
Section 4 we will examine numerical evidence and make conjectures, but before that
we must resolve one theoretical issue: it is not obvious that the functions fk even
exist, because the linear equations deﬁning them may have no solution. In fact, if
the forced root locations r1, r2, . . . were chosen diﬀerently, then this diﬃculty could
occur. For example, for n = 1, k = 2, r1 = 1, and r2 = 1.3403207576 . . . (chosen to
satisfy a certain polynomial equation with coeﬃcients in Q[π]), the constraints (3.4)
deﬁning f2 have no solution. Fortunately, existence and uniqueness do hold in our
cases:
Lemma 3.1. For any algebraic numbers 0 < r1 < ··· < rk, there exists a unique
polynomial qk of degree 4k − 1 such that the constraints (3.4) hold for fk(x) =

the determinant is nonzero, by identifying its leading coeﬃcient as a polynomial in

This replacement dramatically simpliﬁes the equations, because we can reinterpret
them as describing a more tractable interpolation problem. The new equations ask
for the coeﬃcients of a polynomial of degree 4k−1 with the following constraints. Its
value at 0 is speciﬁed, its value at 2πr2

(−1)jpj(x) into (−x)j. This interpolation problem is a special case of Hermite
interpolation, and the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix is therefore nonzero.
(See Subsection 2.1 of [CK2] for a review of Hermite interpolation.)

It follows that the coeﬃcient matrix of the original equations also has a nonzero
(cid:3)

determinant, so there exists a unique solution.

4. Numerical evidence

In this section we will examine the numerical evidence for convergence. Our
calculations are based on ﬂoating-point arithmetic, with no rigorous bounds on
the rounding error, but we believe all reported digits are correct. (We believe that
these calculations could be made rigorous if necessary, for example by using interval
arithmetic or the techniques from Appendix A in [CK3].) When using k forced
root locations, we carried out all computations to 8k + 75 digits of precision using
PARI/GP. Experimentation suggests that 8k + 75 digits is far more precision than
is actually needed, but it is easier to pick an unnecessarily high bound than to
calibrate how little precision we could get away with.

First, consider the naive approach discussed in the previous section, in which one
takes the forced root locations r1, . . . , rk to be the ﬁrst k nonzero vector lengths
in the optimal lattice. Though at ﬁrst this approach gives good bounds, it subtly
reverses course and eventually fails completely for large n (see Table 2). In the R8
case, the bound improves as k grows until k = 40, at which point it is slightly better
than the bound proved in [CE] (and much better than the previous record bound of
≈ 1.012). However, after k = 40 the bound steadily gets worse. By k = 130, the
bound would be less than 1, which is impossible and indicates that the function
must have developed an unwanted sign change by that point. In the R24 case, the
problems are even more dramatic.
This failure demonstrates the diﬃculty of making predictions based on limited
numerical data. If one looked at only the data for k ≤ 40 and n = 8, one might
reasonably conjecture that the bound was converging to 1 (although a sophisticated
analysis would indicate that the convergence was happening uncomfortably slowly
as k neared 40).

This eﬀect is reminiscent of Runge’s phenomenon from interpolation theory (see
[Ep]). Although the problem is not literally overconstrained, forcing too many roots
at the limiting locations constrains the function so much that it develops undesired
oscillations to compensate. Pushing the larger roots towards inﬁnity seemingly
relaxes the constraints, dampens the oscillations, and allows convergence.

We have been unable to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the functions fk
deﬁned using the roots (3.5), but they lead to excellent bounds (see Table 3) and

subsets of this neighborhood.

they are admissible.

As evidence for Conjecture 4.1, we oﬀer Figure 1, which demonstrates steady
convergence as k increases from 30 to 100, at a selection of sample points with real
parts up to 5 and imaginary parts up to 0.2. In fact, convergence seems to hold
even for somewhat larger imaginary parts; for example, Table 4 shows the values at
i/2. However, convergence does not occur when the imaginary part is 1 or more; for
example, for n = 8 we have

that is enough to imply Conjecture 4.2. However, it is unclear whether this stronger
hypothesis is true. As one can see from the data in Table 5, the complex roots are
growing steadily closer to the real axis, and they might reach it around k = 1400.
Even if they eventually reach the axis, we conjecture that any unwanted sign changes
will occur far from the origin and will disappear in the limit as k → ∞. It is plausible
that one could remove them entirely by modifying (3.5).

The complex root locations have several mysterious properties. See Figure 2 for
plots with k = 600 and n = 8, and Figure 3 for plots with n = 24 (which are very
similar to the n = 8 case). The roots lie on several clear curves, and they are most
likely accumulating on the boundary of the domain of holomorphy. Note that their
nearest approach to the real axis is quite far from the origin, as we asserted above.

One surprising observation is that fk and (cid:98)fk have nearly the same roots away
fk or (cid:98)fk that do not agree to six decimal places with any root of the other. Only
the fk and (cid:98)fk columns become nearly identical as k grows.
For comparison, Table 6 shows the nearest roots to the origin. In each case, (cid:98)fk
other roots are roughly paired up for fk and (cid:98)fk, but these pairs are not nearly as

show clear convergence when n = 8 and possible convergence when n = 24). The

the roots relatively near the origin appear in these plots. See also Table 5, in which

close to each other as those further from the origin. We see no reason to think any
of the non-real roots are converging except for the purely imaginary roots.

It is clear from this data that the roots have considerable structure, which we
are unable to explain conceptually. More data could help, but calculations for large

k are very time consuming. We have computed fk and (cid:98)fk for k = 700, 800, and 900,

but we have not located their roots. If they have no unexpected sign changes, then
with k = 900 we get sphere packing bounds within a factor of 1 + 5.33 × 10−72 of
the density of E8 or 1 + 3.04 × 10−62 of that of the Leech lattice. We expect that
these bounds are true and could be proved given enough computing power, but the
evidence is not as conclusive as it is in the cases for which we have located the roots.

It follows from Conjecture 4.2 that f and (cid:98)f have no unexpected sign changes.

Thus, Conjectures 4.1 and 4.2 for n = 8 or 24 would solve the sphere packing
problem in Rn.

It is interesting to note that the parameter n in these conjectures can be varied,
while leaving the forced root locations ﬁxed. Of course there is no connection with

sphere packing for general n (it does not even have to be an integer). If a limiting f

exists, it also does not follow in general that f (0) = (cid:98)f (0), since that requires Poisson

summation over an appropriate lattice. However, the analogues of Conjectures 4.1
and 4.2 do seem to hold in all small dimensions (although we have not investigated
them as carefully as the n = 8 and n = 24 cases). In particular, we conjecture
that if fk is deﬁned with forced roots based on the E8 vector lengths, then these
conjectures hold for 0 < n < 10 (for n = 10 there in fact appear to be extraneous
real roots). This ﬂexibility is encouraging, because it suggests that a proof need
not depend on speciﬁc facts about R8, but rather could hold for much more general
reasons. Similarly, for the Leech lattice vector lengths the conjectures seem to hold
for 0 < n < 26. More generally, many of the phenomena we study in this paper are
not restricted to n = 8 and n = 24. For example, we make the following conjecture:

Conjecture 4.3. For 0 < n < 10, forcing roots at the E8 vector lengths yields a
limiting function f satisfying

This conjecture is evidence that the limiting functions have even more intricate

structure than is apparent just from the n = 8 and n = 24 cases.

Note that for reasons of computational eﬃciency, one should never solve the
equations (3.6) directly. Instead, it is more convenient to solve two systems, each
of half the size. To form them, we write the polynomial qk from the deﬁnition

It is tempting to take the limit as k → ∞ and hope to write down an inﬁnite

Computing q0

k independently is substantially faster than computing qk
(approximately four times faster using a cubic-time algorithm). So far, it has not led
to any theoretical advances, but in Section 7 we will see a closely related example
in which it is theoretically important to separate the Fourier eigenfunctions.

5. Rationality

Although we are unable to identify the proposed limiting functions f for di-
mensions 8 and 24, we can say two things about their special values. In fact, the
analysis we provide applies to the functions in the statement of Conjecture 2.2, and
in particular the function explicitly exhibited in [V] for the n = 8 case. The ﬁrst is
a property we can derive, while the second has been observed only numerically and
so far lacks an explanation.
The ﬁrst observation is that we can predict the value of f(cid:48)(r1), where r1 is the
ﬁrst forced root. Here we view f as a function of a single radial variable, so f(cid:48) is
the radial derivative. By condition (3.4), knowing f(cid:48)(r1) means we know the values
of both f and f(cid:48) at every vector length in the respective lattices (E8 and Leech) for
dimensions 8 and 24.
Lemma 5.1. Let n ∈ {2, 8, 24}, and let f be a hypothetical optimal function for
use in Theorem 2.1, as in Conjecture 2.2. Then

agree for k = 300 and k = 600.) One can see from the decimal expansions that the
quadratic coeﬃcients are rational, but the quartic coeﬃcients remain mysterious.

Conjecture 5.2. For n = 8, the limiting functions f and (cid:98)f have quadratic Taylor
coeﬃcients −27/10 and −3/2, respectively (when normalized so that f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) =

1). For n = 24, the corresponding coeﬃcients are −14347/5460 and −205/156.

The same is true when n = 8 for the functions studied in [V].
We do not know whether the higher Taylor coeﬃcients are rational or even given
by simple expressions at all. Needless to say, it would be interesting to have explicit
formulas for the general coeﬃcients, because this would give a direct construction

of f and (cid:98)f by power series and analytic continuation.

To put this conjecture in a slightly broader context, consider the Mellin transform

(cid:90) ∞

0

Mf (s) =

f (x)xs−1 dx.

When f is smooth and rapidly decreasing (as Conjecture 4.1 implies), the integral
converges to a holomorphic function for (cid:60)s > 0. It is a standard fact that Mf (s)
can be meromorphically continued to C, with at most simple poles at s ∈ Z≤0;
furthermore, for integers j ≥ 0 its residue at s = −j is the j-th Taylor coeﬃcient of
j≥0 cjxj about

f . To see why, note that if f (x) has the Taylor series expansion(cid:80)

x = 0, then

where both integrals converge as long as (cid:60)s > −((cid:96) + 1). Since our function f is
radial, its Taylor coeﬃcients cj vanish if j is odd.

A short calculation (see [LL, Theorem 5.9]) shows that if (cid:98)f is the n-dimensional

Fourier transform of f (interpreted as a radial function), then

valid as an identity of meromorphic functions on C. In particular, computing the
residue of Mf (s) at s = −j shows that the j-th Taylor coeﬃcient of f equals

M(cid:98)f (n + j),

M(cid:98)f (n + 2). The values Mf (n) and M(cid:98)f (n) are easy consequences of f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) = 1.

Thus, in n dimensions Conjecture 5.2 amounts to specifying Mf (n + 2) and
We have identiﬁed one other value, namely the midpoint 4 of the s ↔ n−s symmetry
when n = 8:

Conjecture 5.3. For n = 8, the limiting functions satisfy

Mf (4) = M(cid:98)f (4) =

15

when normalized with f (0) = (cid:98)f (0) = 1.
The equality Mf (4) = M(cid:98)f (4) follows from (5.2), but not the value 1/15. It is

natural to expect a corresponding conjecture for n = 24, but we have been unable
to identify the numerical value

Mf (12) = M(cid:98)f (12) = 0.177860964729650276645646126241 . . .

in that case.

6. Energy minimization

One natural generalization of sphere packing is potential energy minimization.
Given a radial potential function ϕ : Rn → R and a set P of point particles, the
energy Eϕ(P, x) of a particle x ∈ P is deﬁned to be
ϕ(x − y),

(cid:88)

y∈P, y(cid:54)=x

and the energy Eϕ(P) is deﬁned as the average of Eϕ(P, x) over all x ∈ P. (Of
course some hypotheses are needed for this to make sense, but it is well deﬁned
when P is a periodic discrete set and ϕ is rapidly decreasing.) The question of
how to choose P so as to minimize energy with a ﬁxed density, arises naturally in
physics; see [C2] for a survey.
Cohn and Kumar [CK2] deﬁned a conﬁguration P to be universally optimal if it
minimizes energy whenever ϕ(x) is completely monotonic as a function of |x|2 and
decreases suﬃciently quickly. For example, ϕ could be a suﬃciently steep inverse
power law. As explained in Section 9 of [CK2], it suﬃces to check optimality for
the Gaussians ϕ(x) = e−c|x|2
with c > 0, i.e., the Gaussian core model [S] from
mathematical physics. Cohn and Kumar conjectured that the hexagonal lattice,
E8, and the Leech lattice are universally optimal. (See [CKS] for information about
ground states in other dimensions.)

Proposition 9.3 of [CK2] oﬀers an approach to proving this conjecture by linear
programming bounds, which Cohn and Kumar conjectured were sharp in these special
dimensions (much like the case of sphere packing). Given an admissible auxiliary

function h : Rn → R satisfying h ≤ ϕ and(cid:98)h ≥ 0 everywhere, this proposition says

PROPERTIES OF OPTIMAL FUNCTIONS

19

that every conﬁguration P of density 1 satisﬁes

Eϕ(P) ≥(cid:98)h(0) − h(0).

radial polynomial times e−π|x|2

We can construct h by imitating the sphere packing construction: let h(x) be a
, with the polynomial chosen with minimal degree so

that ϕ − h and(cid:98)h have double roots at the modiﬁed root locations from Section 3.

We conjecture that as the number of roots tends to inﬁnity, these functions converge
and the limiting functions prove a sharp bound for energy.

The closest analogue of Conjectures 5.2 and 5.3 we have found is the following.
in Rn with n = 8 or 24,

Conjecture 6.1. For the potential function ϕ(x) = e−c|x|2
the limiting auxiliary function h satisﬁes
2c
n

(cid:98)h(0) =

Eψ(Λn),

where Λn is E8 or the Leech lattice when n = 8 or 24, respectively, and ψ(x) =
|x|2ϕ(x).

Besides numerical evidence, one reason to believe this conjecture is that it is
compatible with duality symmetry. If the auxiliary function h proves an energy

bound for an integrable potential function ϕ, then g := (cid:98)ϕ −(cid:98)h does so for (cid:98)ϕ.
Speciﬁcally, g ≤ (cid:98)ϕ since(cid:98)h ≥ 0, and(cid:98)g ≥ 0 since h ≤ ϕ. This duality transformation
then g proves that the dual lattice Λ∗ minimizes E(cid:98)ϕ. To see why, note that
ϕ(0) +(cid:98)h(0)− h(0) = (cid:98)ϕ(0) +(cid:98)g(0)− g(0), from which it follows by Poisson summation

if h proves that a lattice Λ of covolume 1 minimizes Eϕ,

preserves optimality:

that

if and only if

(cid:98)h(0) − h(0) = Eϕ(Λ)
(cid:98)g(0) − g(0) = E(cid:98)ϕ(Λ∗).

This duality is compatible with Conjecture 6.1, in the sense that h satisﬁes the
conjecture if and only if g does; the compatibility is not obvious, but it follows from
a short calculation using Poisson summation.

7. Forcing single roots

In this section we discuss a related problem: constructing functions with forced
single roots (instead of the forced double roots used earlier in the paper). Such
functions do not have direct applications to sphere packing, but they can be explicitly
written down in some cases and thus serve as a testing ground for ideas concerning
our main conjectures. Furthermore, their properties are quite a bit more interesting
than one would guess from their deﬁnition.

The structure in this problem is best seen by forcing single roots for Fourier
eigenfunctions. The use of eigenfunctions was merely a computational convenience
in Section 4, but in this section it will play an essential role in our conjectures.

For ε ∈ {0, 1}, let

gε
n,k = rε

n,k(|x|2)e−π|x|2

,

where rε
vanishes at 2, 4, . . . , 2k, and is a linear combination of the polynomials pn/2−1

n,k is a polynomial of degree at most 2k + ε that is not identically zero,
for
n,k. The same arguments

0 ≤ j ≤ k. The last condition means that(cid:98)gε

HENRY COHN AND STEPHEN D. MILLER

as in Lemma 3.1 shows that these functions exist and are unique, up to scaling. We
see no canonical way to scale them, so we will not choose a preferred scaling.

The choice of 2, 4, . . . , 2k as forced root locations is inspired by the norms of the
vectors in the E8 lattice. One could also study the analogous functions for the Leech
lattice, but we have focused on the simplest case. Note that we use the exact vector
norms, with no need to modify them along the lines of (3.5).

We have no explanation for the exceptional behavior in four dimensions.

Proposition 7.3. The functions listed in Conjecture 7.2 are all eigenfunctions of
the Fourier transform, with the appropriate eigenvalues.
Sketch of proof. This can be veriﬁed by straightforward calculation. Because x (cid:55)→
e−π|x|2
is its own Fourier transform, it follows that when Re(α) > 0, the Fourier
transform of x (cid:55)→ e−π|x|2α is x (cid:55)→ e−π|x|2/α/αn/2. Diﬀerentiating with respect to α
allows one to compute the Fourier transform of x (cid:55)→ |x|2ke−π|x|2α for k ∈ {1, 2, . . .}.

The result when n ≡ 0 (mod 3) follows easily from the fact that
3/2 + i/2 is a
12-th root of unity, and the results when n (cid:54)≡ 0 (mod 3) follow from similar but
slightly more elaborate calculations. The trickiest case is when n = 4, because it
involves dividing by |x|2. That can be handled by integrating with respect to α
(cid:3)
instead of diﬀerentiating.

Note that the limiting functions in Conjecture 7.2 are entire and have imaginary

√−2j for each j > 0. It is not clear where these imaginary roots come

roots at
from. There are also a ﬁnite number of extraneous real roots, which appear to be
needed to create Fourier eigenfunctions. If one plots the roots of these functions
(as in Figure 4), one sees the expected roots on the real axis, the surprising purely
imaginary roots, the ﬁnite set of extraneous roots, and a V-shaped collection of
non-real roots spreading out from the imaginary axis. It seems that as k → ∞, that
ﬁnal collection tends to inﬁnity and contributes no roots in the limit. It does serve,
however, to reduce the exponent in the Gaussian from the original −π to −π
3/2.
Note also that the root of g1
8m at the origin must occur by Poisson summation over
8 (so it is not extraneous in the same sense, even though it was not deliberately

√

forced).

Whenever the dimension is a multiple of 4, Conjecture 7.2 predicts one of the
two eigenfunctions Conjecture 7.1 asserts exists. The other eigenfunction is more
mysterious. It does not have imaginary roots at

roots at (cid:112)−(2j − 1), but not quite. For example, g0
√−2j. Instead, it almost has
by a dominant term, which has roots at exactly(cid:112)−(2j − 1), plus some lower order

8 appears to vanish at the
square roots of the numbers from Table 8. The precise perturbations away from
the odd integers depend on the dimension. We do not know an explanation for this
interesting behavior. The most natural possibility is that these functions are given

terms. However, we have been unable to conjecture a formula of this sort.
More general convergence theorems are likely true. For example, in four dimen-
sions, if we force an extra factor of |x|2−c in the +1 eigenfunction, then the resulting
functions seem to converge to

4(x)(cid:0)|x|2 − c(cid:1)(cid:16)

g0

.

(Note that now the extraneous roots need not be real.) It seems plausible that
in each case covered by Conjecture 7.2, forcing some additional ﬁnite set of roots
simply creates an additional factor corresponding to a ﬁnite set of extraneous roots.
That does not seem to be true for the mysterious eigenfunctions not predicted by
Conjecture 7.2 (i.e., forcing another root does not seem to multiply them by a
polynomial factor, but instead changes the imaginary root perturbations as well).

In dimensions that are not multiples of four, we do not know any closed form
expressions for the limiting eigenfunctions. It appears that they behave somewhat
like the mysterious eigenfunctions in the multiple-of-four case (i.e., those not pre-
dicted by Conjecture 7.2). For example, g0
2 appears to have imaginary roots at
some perturbation of the square roots of −2.5, −4.5, −6.5, etc., and g1
2 at some
perturbation of the square roots of −1.5, −3.5, −5.5, etc. We have focused on the
multiples of four because they seem simpler (and perhaps more relevant to sphere
packing).
