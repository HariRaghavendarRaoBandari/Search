Thermal conductivity of hadron matter is studied using a microscopic transport model, which will
be used to simulate ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at diﬀerent energy densities ε, namely the
Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD). The molecular dynamics simulation is
performed for a system of light mesons species (π, ρ, K) in a box with periodic boundary conditions.
Equilibrium state is investigated by studying chemical equilibrium and thermal equilibrium of the
system. Particle multiplicity equilibrates with time, and the energy spectra of diﬀerent light mesons
species have the same slopes and common temperatures when thermal equilibrium is reached. Ther-
mal conductivity transport coeﬃcient is calculated from the heat current - current correlations using
the Green-Kubo relations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A large number of studies in heavy ion physics and
high energy physics have been done using the results
from Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Now with
the restart of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics
programme, the ﬁeld of high energy nuclear physics,
and especially heavy ion physics, has gone into a new
era.
It is now possible to explore the properties of
Quantum-Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) at unprecedented
particle densities and temperatures at much higher en-
ergies than that produced at RHIC from √s = 200 GeV
to √s = 14 TeV at LHC [1, 2].

High energy heavy ion reactions are studied experi-
mentally and theoretically to obtain information about
the properties of nuclear matter under extreme con-
ditions at high densities and temperatures as well as
about the phase transition to new state of matter, the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [3–5]. This work reports on
the transport coeﬃcient namely thermal conductivity of
hadron matter. Other transport coeﬃcients such as shear
and bulk viscosity are well discussed and documented
[5, 6], but the study of thermal conductivity transport
coeﬃcient is poorly documented especially with the use
of UrQMD model to simulate ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions. The knowledge of this transport coeﬃcient
plays an important role in the development of the model
such as UrQMD model and also the development of high
energy heavy ion experiments such as LHC and RHIC.

To study transport coeﬃcients of hadronic matter, an
equilibrated system is considered. Hence equilibration of
this system is studied in an inﬁnite hadronic matter using
microscopic transport model which can now support new
LHC energy of √s = 2.76 TeV for lead+lead (Pb+Pb)
central collisions the UrQMD. [3, 7–10].

Equilibration of the system is studied by evaluating
particle number densities from chemical equilibrium, en-
ergy spectra as well as the temperatures from thermal
equilibrium of diﬀerent light meson species in a cubic
box which imposes periodic boundary conditions. This
means that if a particle leaves the box another particle
with the same momentum enters the box from either side
[11].

The inﬁnite hadron matter is modelled by initializing
the system with light meson species namely the pion (π),
the rho (ρ) and the kaon (K). We also pay our attention
to the equation of state of hot dense hadron gases as it
is an important quantity in high energy nuclear physics.
The knowledge of the equation of state (EoS) is impor-
tant for better understanding of the ﬁnal state of inter-
actions which is dominated by hadrons produced during
ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The EoS of nuclear
matter is one of the key points to gain further under-
standing since EoS directly provides the relationship be-
tween the pressure and the energy at a given net-baryon
density [12]. The thermodynamic properties, transport
coeﬃcients and EoS for hadron gas are a major source of
uncertainties in dissipative ﬂuid dynamics [5, 10, 13].

We focus on the hadronic scale temperature (100 MeV
< T < 200 MeV) and zero baryon number density which
is expected to be realized in the central high energy nu-
clear collisions [8]. We then change energy density from
ε = 0.1 - 0.5 GeV/fm3 and for each energy density we
run the system with 200 events while keeping volume
and baryon number density constant until the equilib-
rium state is reached. Thermal conductivity transport
coeﬃcient is calculated from the heat current - current
correlations using the Green-Kubo relations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In sec-
tion 2 we study the description of the UrQMD model.
In section 3 we study equilibration properties of the sys-
tem. In section 4 we study the equation of state (EoS)
of the hadron gas. In section 5 we calculate thermal con-

ductivity transport coeﬃcient around equilibrium state
through UrQMD model using Green-Kubo relations.

and are conserved throughout the simulation. The en-
ergy density is deﬁned as ε = E
V , where E is the energy
of N particles given by

II. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE URQMD

MODEL

E =

The Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamic
model (UrQMD) is a microscopic model based on a phase
space description of nuclear reactions. We use the cur-
rent version of UrQMD namely the UrQMD 3.3. The
UrQMD 3.3 hybrid approach extends previous ansatzes
to combine the hydrodynamic and the transport models
for the relativistic energies, combining these approaches
into one single framework it is done for a consistent de-
scription of the dynamics [1].

The UrQMD model describes the phenomenology of
hadronic interactions at low and intermediate energies
from few hundreds MeV up to the newly LHC energy
of √s =14 TeV per nucleon in the centre of the mass
system [8, 14–16]. The UrQMD collision term contains 55
diﬀerent baryon species and 32 meson species which are
supplemented by their corresponding anti-particles and
all the isospin-projected states [7, 15]. The properties
of the baryons and the baryon-resonances which can be
populated in UrQMD can be found in [7] together with
their respective mesons and the meson-resonances. A
collision between two hadrons will occur if

dtrans ≤ r σtot

π

,

σtot = σ(√s, type).

(1)

Where dtrans and σtot are the impact parameter and the
total cross-section of the two hadrons, respectively [15].
In the UrQMD model the total cross-section σtot depends
on the isospins of colliding particles, their ﬂavour and the
centre-of-mass (c.m) energy √s. More details about the
UrQMD model is presented in [7, 15, 16].

III. EQUILIBRATION OF HADRONIC MATTER

To investigate the equilibrition of a system the UrQMD
model is used to simulate the ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions. A multi-particle production plays an impor-
tant role in the equilibration of the hadrons gas [5]. The
system of cubic box used for this study is initialized ac-
cording to the following number of particle for each me-
son i.e 80 pions, 160 rhos and 80 kaons. For this study
a cubic box with volume V and a ﬁxed baryon number
density nB = 0.0 fm−3 is considered.

Thermal conductivity transport coeﬃcient for hadron
gas can be obtained by using a microscopic model that
includes realistic interactions among hadrons. Thus one
can adopt a relativistic microscopic model, UrQMD and
perform molecular dynamical simulations for hadron gas
of mesons [5].

The energy density ε, volume V and the baryon num-
ber density nB in the box are ﬁxed as input parameters

and the three-momenta pi of the particles in the ini-
tial state are randomly distributed in the centre of mass
system of the particles that is

(3)

The time evolution of the particles is described by
the UrQMD. We consider time evolutions of the parti-
cle densities and the energy distributions of diﬀerent me-
son species. The system tends towards equilibrium state
when the time and the energy increases as discussed in
subsection 3.1 and section 3.2.

A. Chemical Equilibrium

In this subsection the chemical equilibrium is studied
from the particle number densities of diﬀerent light me-
son species in a box with V = 1000 fm3, zero net baryon
number density nB = 0.0 fm−3 at diﬀerent energy densi-
ties using UrQMD box calculations. Figure 1 and ﬁgure 2
represent the time evolution of the various meson number
densities at ε = 0.2 and 0.3 GeV/fm3 energy densities.
In ﬁgure 1 and ﬁgure 2 the results obtained where very
small thus formula (4) is used to rescale those results for
better analysis of the results and for a much readable
plots

where nπ,ρ,K is the particle number density (fm−3) for
each meson consideredin this UrQMD model and Lπ,ρ,K
is the scailing factor for each meson. In this calculation
Lπ = 1 fm3, Lρ = 200 fm3 and LK = 100 fm3.

light meson species, (π, ρ and K) at ε = 0.3 GeV/fm3.

equilibrium of the hadronic matter is studied by exam-
ining the energy distribution of the system in a box with
periodic boundary conditions using UrQMD model. The
particle spectra is given by the momentum distribution
as

dNi
d3p

=

dN

4πEpdE ∝ Ce(−βEi).

(5)

Figure 3 and ﬁgure 4 represent the time evolution of
energy spectra of diﬀerent meson species. The linear
lines are ﬁtted using the Boltzmann distribution which is
aproximated by C exp(−βEi) from Eq. 5 where β = 1/T
is the slope parameter of the distribution and Ei is the
energy of particle i.

Figure 3 and ﬁgure 4 represent the energy spectra of
meson species namely the pion, the kaon and the rho
particles produced during the ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions simulated using the UrQMD model in a box.
The results are plotted as a function of kinetic energy
K = E − m, so that the horizontal axes for all the par-
ticle species coincide [17]. The ﬁgures where produced
at diﬀerent energy densities respectively, with ε = 0.2
GeV/fm3 for ﬁgure 3 and ε = 0.3 GeV/fm3 for ﬁgure 4.
From the ﬁgures 3 and 4 it is observed that the slopes
of the energy distribution converges to common values of
temperatures at diﬀerent times above t = 180 fm/c for
ε = 0.2 GeV/fm3 and above t = 250 fm/c for ε = 0.3
GeV/fm3. In thermal equilibrium the system is charac-
terized by unique temeperature T [17]. The thermal tem-
peratures where extracted from the equilibriumn state
using the Boltzmann distribution T = 118.3 MeV for ε
= 0.2 GeV/fm3 and T = 150.1 MeV for ε = 0.3 GeV/fm3.
These temperatures extracted from diﬀerent energy den-
sities from ε = 0.1 - 0.5 GeV/fm3 will be used to study
EoS and thermal conductivity of hadronic matter.

FIG. 2. The time evolution of particle number densities of
light meson species, (π, ρ and K) at ε = 0.4 GeV/fm3.

In the ﬁgures 1 and 2 the meson species indicates that
the system does indeed reach chemical equilibrium.
It
is observed that the pions have a large amount of the
particle number densities and the reason could be the
decay in the heavier mesons and other particles produced
in the system to form the pions. The saturation of the
particle number densities indicate the realization of the
local equilibrium, and thus as conclusion, the chemical
equilibrium of the system has been reached as in both
ﬁgures the saturation times are the same for all three
mesons regardless the shape of each meson.

In ﬁgure 1 the rhos and kaons particles decreases to
their equilibrium state while pions quickly reach equilib-
rium state and never decreases.
In ﬁgure 2 where the
energy density is high, a change of shapes is observed
for these meson species where by the pions and rhos in-
crease to equilibrium state while the kaon still decreases
to equilibrium state.

In ﬁgure 1 where ε = 0.3 GeV/fm3 the equilibrium
time for all meson species is around t = 22 fm/c and for
ﬁgure 2 at higher energy density of ε = 0.4 GeV/fm3, the
equilibrium time is observed to have increased to t = 32
fm/c. These results show that increase in energy density
inﬂuence the particle multiplicity inside the periodic box
which aﬀect the equilibration time. The higher the en-
ergy density the longer it takes for the mesons to reach
saturation state due to the fact that the particles have
higher energies and they can collide many times before
they reach equilibrium state. for each meson reason be-
ing that particle multiplicity inside the periodic box is
diﬀerent for all three meson species.
It was observed
that when increase in energy density the saturation time
decreases and the number density which is due to large
particle multiplicity because of high energy inside the pe-
riodic box.

B. Thermal Equilibrium and temperature

In this subsection the thermal equilibrium and the tem-
perature from the energy distributions of diﬀerent light
meson species are studied. The possibility of the thermal

same energy density used as an input parameter during
the initialization of the ultra-relativistic heavy ion colli-
sion in the UrQMD. The pressure is then calculated from
the collision results using Eq. (7).

The thermal temperatures used here are extracted
from the thermal equilibrium (section 3.2) using the
Boltzmann distribution function given as C exp( E

T ).

π, the ρ and the K at ﬁnite temperature (100 MeV < T <

From the above ﬁgure 5 and ﬁgure 6, both pressure and
energy density increases with an increase in the temper-
ature. The results are in good comparison with those
sustained in [5, 7].

The focus is on the hadronic scale temperature of (100
MeV < T < 200 MeV) and the zero baryon number den-
sity which is expected to be realized in the central high
energy nuclear collisions [5]. The pressure and energy
density grows with temperature and starts to saturate
just after T = 150 MeV which might indicates that there
is a change in phase transition of the hadron gas. In ﬁg-
ure 5 and ﬁgure 6 at low temperatures between T = 90

IV. HADRONIC GAS MODEL (EOS)

The hadron abundances and the ratios have been sug-
gested as the possible signatures for the exotic states
and the phase transitions of the nuclear matter [18].
The equation of state of hot and dense hadron gas pro-
vides the valuable information regarding the nature of the
hadron gas. These signatures have been applied to the
study of chemical equilibration in the relativistic heavy
ion reactions. The properties like the temperatures, the
entropies and chemical potentials of the hadronic mat-
ter have been extracted assuming thermal and chemical
equilibrium [15].

In this section the EoS for a hadron gas is studied from
the UrQMD calculations. The equation of state can be
studied using a statistical model which is described by
the grand canonical ensemble of non-interacting hadrons
in an equilibrium sate at temperature T as presented in
[5, 7]. A large number of studies have been done to study
EoS of hadron gas [5, 7, 14, 19]. For this study the focus
is only on the EoS of hadrong gas made out of the π, the
ρ and the K calculated from the UrQMD model behaves.
This is done through studying the evolution of pressure
and energy density with temperature.

Some of the thermodynamic quantities used to calcu-

late EoS are the energy density given by

Figure 5 and Figure 6 represent the EoS of hadronic

MeV to T = 150 MeV the power law T 2 of hadron gas
behaves diﬀerently than the power law T 4 at high tem-
perature between T = 155 MeV to T = 170 MeV. The
power law of the solid line ﬁt is T 4 which is the same as
that of hadron gas at high temperatures.

This results concludes that one can only calculate the
thermal conductivity of this system between 100 MeV
and 160 MeV as above 160 MeV while the temperature
increases the system start to behave like that of massless
particles called QGP. The above results in ﬁgure 5 and
ﬁgure 6 shows that the pressure and the energy density
increases to saturation state with temperature which in-
dicate phase transion to a new state of matter the QGP.

V. THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY COEFFICIENT

The transport coeﬃcients such as the thermal conduc-
tivity κ and the shear viscosity η characterize the dy-
namics of the ﬂuctuations of the dissipative ﬂuxes in a
medium [5].

The most often used method to investigate these coef-
ﬁcient is either through employing the kinetic theory or
the ﬁeld theory using the Green-Kubo formula [5].

The Green-Kubo relations for calculation of transport
coeﬃcients of shear viscosity, thermal conductivity, ther-
mal diﬀusion and mutual diﬀusion for a binary mixture
of hard spheres as well as for the calculation of diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of a hadron [4, 5, 20, 21].

A knowledge of various transport coeﬃcients is im-
portant for the dissipative ﬂuid dynamical model. One
can calculate the coeﬃcient of thermal conductivity from
the ﬂuctuation-dissipative theorem. The ﬂuctuation-
dissipative theorem tells us that the thermal conductivity
is given by the heat current-current correlations [22].

The Green and Kubo showed that the transport coeﬃ-
cients like heat conductivity, shear and the bulk viscosi-
ties can be related to the correlation functions of the
corresponding ﬂux or the tensor in the thermal equi-
librium [20]. The Green-Kubo formalism relates linear
transport coeﬃcients to near-equilibrium correlations of
dissipative ﬂuxes and treats dissipative ﬂuxes as pertur-
bations to local thermal equilibrium [23]. The relevant
formular for Green-Kubo relation for thermal conductiv-
ity can be written as [24]

In Eq. (8) the brackets <...> stand for the equilibrium

time correlation function for the thermal conductivity is
also given as [24]

We adopt a relativistic microscopic model, namely the

mal conductivity coeﬃcient of the hadron gas.

Figure 7 shows the square expectation of heat cur-
rent results obtained from UrQMD model. The heat
current increases with increase in temperature. These
results are in good comparison with those obtained in
[22], where a diﬀerent model named URASIMA was used.
The UrQMD square expectation of heat current is much
smaller from that obtained in [22], reason might be that
for this study we only considered a situation of only me-
son species and zero baryon number. Figure 8 shows ther-
mal conductivity of hadron gas and ﬁgure 9 shows the
product of thermal conductivity coeﬃcient times tem-
peratureas a function of temperature calculated from
UrQMD model. Both, κ, and, κT , increases with an in-
crease in temperature and the saturation is reached below
T = 0.17 GeV where the hadronic gas with zero baryon
number density is expected to be realized in the central
high energy nuclear collisions [5].

According to our simulation we observed a strong tem-
perature dependence. The temperature behavior of the
product of the thermal conductivity and temperature is
κT ∼ T 3.88 and for thermal conductvity is κ ∼ T 2.88.
The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity in
this study is greater T 3.88 > T 2 than the one reported
by [25] where by the author used Eﬀective Field The-
ory and it is less T 3.88 < T 4 than the one reported by
[22] whereby the author used diﬀerent simulation model

6

called URASIMA and diﬀerent system which consist of
baryon number density.

Due to less number of studies done under thermal con-
ductivity coeﬃcient it is diﬃcult to make a proper con-
clusion from the results obtained, but from the compari-
son with the little study done already which is related to
this topic one can conclude that the results are in good
comparison with those reported by [22].

The results in this study for ﬁgure 8 and ﬁgure 9 are
smaller and that of ﬁgure 10 are larger than those re-
ported in [22]. The reason might be that the author
was using diﬀerent input parameters for the initializa-
tion of the system. In our case we only consider a box of
only meson and zero baryon number densities. Figure 10
shows the relaxation time for the heat ﬂux of hot hadron
gas as a function of temperature calculated from UrQMD
model by ﬁtting the heat correlation functions. The heat
relaxation time decrease with an increase in temperature
similarly to the one reported in [5, 22].

VI. CONCLUSION

Thermal conductivity transport coeﬃcient of hadron
gas was studied using a microscopic transport model the
UrQMD to simulate the ultra-relativistic heavy ion col-
lisions in a box with a periodic boundary conditions and
V . From the equilibrium state, thermal conductivity was
calculated from the heat current - current correlations us-
ing the Green-Kubo relations.

It was observed that the square expectation of the heat
current, thermal conductivity and the product of thermal
conductivity and temperature increase with an increase
in temperature. The saturation temperature for square
expectation of the heat current, thermal conductivity and
the product of thermal conductivity and temperature is
below T = 170 MeV similarly to that of the equation of
state. The power law shows a high temperature depen-
dence for both κ and κT . The heat current relaxation
time was calculated from heat correlation function. The
relaxation time decrease with an increase in temperature.
The results of heat current is in good comparison with
that of [22] with regards to the behaviour of the graph.

From the presented results, it can be concluded that
it is possible to calculate thermal conductivity transport
coeﬃcient using the UrQMD model. More study is still
required for better understanding of the results and the
coeﬃcient. The future studies will be to focus on how
the thermal conductivity transport coeﬃcient is aﬀected
by adding diﬀerent number of meson species in the box
including baryon number density in order to compare
with other studies such as that reported by [22] and to
increase energies inside the box to that of LHC as well
as increasing the collision events.
