THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

Abstract. In this paper, we discuss the Weyl problem in warped product space.
We obtain the openness, non rigidity and some applications. These results to-
gether with the a priori estimates obtained by Lu imply some existence results.
Meanwhile we reprove the inﬁnitesimal rigidity in the space forms.

1. introduction

The isometric embedding problem is one of the fundamental problems in diﬀer-
ential geometry. Among them, Weyl problem is very important. It is a milestone in
the development of nonlinear elliptic partial diﬀerential equation, especially, Monge-
Amp´ere type. In 1916, Weyl proposed the following problem. Does every smooth
metric on two dimensional sphere with positive Gauss curvature admit a smooth
isometric embedding in three dimensional Euclidean space. Weyl [39] suggested the
method of continuity to solve his problem. He also gave the openness part for the
analytic case and established an estimate on the mean curvature of the embedded
strictly convex surfaces which, in fact, is C 2 a priori estimate for the embedding.
The analytic case was fully solved by Lewy [23]. In 1953, Nirenberg, in his celebrated
paper [29], generalized Weyl problem to the smooth case and exhibited a beautiful
proof. Alexandrov and Pogorelov [32] used diﬀerent approach to solve the problem
independently. Pogorelov [33] also generalized Nirenberg’s theorem to hyperbolic
space H3
−κ which is constant negative sectional curvature −κ. In 1990s Weyl’s es-
timate was generalized to degenerate case with nonnegative Gauss curvature by
Guan-Li [12], Hong-Zuily [19] and partially by J.A. Iaia [21]. Recently, Chang-Xiao
[5] and Lin-Wang [24] also consider the degenerate case for Pogorelov’s theorem in
hyperbolic space. More material about isometric embedding in Euclidean space can
be found in [17].

In general relativity, it is a diﬃcult problem to deﬁne suitable quasi-local mass. In
1993, using mean curvature, Brown and York [4] proposed the following deﬁnition:
Let (Ω, g) be some compact Riemannian 3 manifold, and suppose its boundary ∂Ω
has positive Gauss curvature, they deﬁne the following quantity

(1.1)

mBY (∂Ω) =

(H0 − H)dσ,

1

8π Z∂Ω

where H and H0 are mean curvature of ∂Ω in original Reimannian manifold and
Euclidean space if it can be isometrically embedded in R3. By Nirenberg’s isometric

embedding theorem, we know that there exists such isometric embedding. In 2002,
an important work by Shi and Tam [36] has shown that the Brown-York mass is
nonnegative.

In [25, 26], Liu-Yau introduced Liu-Yau quasi-local mass

(1.2)

mLY (∂Ω) =

1

8π Z∂Ω

(H0 − |H|)dσ,

where |H| is the Lorentzian norm of the mean curvature vector. They also proved
the nonnegativity of their mass. In [40, 41, 42], Wang and Yau deﬁne some new
quasilocal mass generalizing Brown-York mass. They have used the Pogorelov’s work
on the isometric embedding of sphere into hyperbolic space. The nonnegativity of
Wang-Yau mass is also obtained in [40, 37].

The deﬁnitions of the Brown-York mass and the Wang-Yau mass suggest us that
isometric embedding of the sphere into some model space always plays important
role for quasi local mass problem. Hence, it seems that it is valuable to generalize
the Weyl problem to some other 3 dimensional ambient space which is not a space
form. It may be helpful for the further discussion of quasi local mass.

As we know, the Weyl problem has not been studied in general Reimannian
manifold. In the present paper, we try to study the Weyl problem in 3 dimensional
warped product space.

The warped product spaces is Rn with some nontrivial but rotation symmetric

metrics. In fact, we can write the metric in polar coordinates

(1.3)

ds2 =

1

f 2(r)

dr2 + r2dS2

n−1,

where r is the radius parameter and dS2
n−1 is the standard metric of n − 1 sphere.
f depends only on r which is called warped function. It is well known that if we
choose the warped function to be

(1.4)

f (r) =p1 + κr2,

then the corresponding warped product space becomes space form with the sectional
curvature κ. If the warped function is in the form

(1.5)

f (r) =r1 −

m
r

+ κr2,

these spaces are called Anti-de Sitter-Schwarzschild (or AdS for short) space. They
are special interesting examples to generalize quasi local mass.

Now we give the outline and main results in this paper. The continuity method
was used in the proof of Weyl problem. As in [24], using normalized Ricci ﬂow
we can ﬁnd the homotopy path to connect standard metric and the given metric
g on S2. Hence we need to deal with closeness, openness, rigidity and convexity.
Recently, the closeness has been obtained in [11]. In the ﬁrst part of this paper,
we establish the openness for strictly convex surface in any 3-dimensional warped
product spaces.

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

Theorem 1. Let g be some smooth metric on sphere S2. Suppose g can be isomet-
rically embedded into the three dimensional warped product space as a closed strictly
convex surface. Then for any α ∈ (0, 1), there exists a positive ǫ, depending only on
g and α, such that, for any smooth metric ˜g on S2 satisfying

˜g also can be isometrically embedded into the warped product space as another closed
strictly convex surface.

kg − ˜gkC 2,α(S2) < ǫ,

This theorem is proved by solving the linearized problem of isometric system. In
fact, we have proved that the linearized system always can be solved without so
called inﬁnitesimal rigidity which is diﬀerent from the Nirenberg’s original proof.
We also note the recent work of A.J.C. Pacheco and P. Miao [34]. They have proved
the openness near the standard sphere metric in Schwarzschild manifolds with small
mass. Their paper reminds us that Theorem 1 implies that openness holds for any
strictly convex surface in conformal ﬂat 3 manifolds, since conformal ﬂat manifolds
are also warped product space.

Combining the openness with the closeness theorem, we can obtain some existence

results. One of them is the following.

Theorem 2. Suppose the three dimensional warped product space M do not have
singularity and the warped function f satisﬁes the assumption (a) and (b). Then
for any metric g on S2, if its Gauss curvature K > K0 for some constant K0, there
is some isometric embedding of (S2, g) ~r in M , such that ~r is some strictly convex
surface.

Here the assumption (a), (b) and the constant K0 is deﬁned by (5.1) in section 5.
The above existence theorem is proposed and proved by Guan-Lu [11] and Lu [27].
In the second part, we discuss the inﬁnitesimal rigidity for space form. It is well
known that the inﬁnitesimal rigidity for closed convex surface is obtained by Cohn-
Vossen [7]. Then it is simpliﬁed by Blaschke in [2] using Minkowski identities. The
inﬁnitesimal rigidity in hyperbolic space is also discussed by Lin-Wang [24]. In this
paper, we give an alternative proof.

Theorem 3. Suppose M is a convex compact surface in three dimensional space
form, then it’s inﬁnitesimally rigid. Namely, the solutions to the linearized problem
come from the Lie algebra of the isometry group of the ambient space.

In the Euclidean space, we give two proofs only using maximum principle. The
idea comes from [15] and [18]. For hyperbolic and spherical space cases, we use
Beltrami map to extend the inﬁnitesimal rigidity in Euclidean space to space forms.
It is diﬀerent from the original proof. The Beltrami map also can be used to extend
the openness from Euclidean space to space form.

The third part discusses the rigidity for isometric problem in warped product
space. The global rigidity is also obtained by Cohn-Vossen for convex surfaces [6].
The space form cases are still valid [8, 14]. Diﬀerent from the space form case, in
general warped product spaces except space form the rigidity is always not true.
For any strictly convex surface, since the isometry group will become smaller, we

4

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

always can prove the non inﬁnitesimal rigidity. Combing this fact with the idea in
the proof of the openness, we can obtain global non rigidity for any strictly convex
surface. But in fact, we can have some a little weak non rigidity for geodesic sphere
in any dimension. Explicitly, we have proved that,

Theorem 4. In n dimensional warped product space, the r radius geodesic sphere
is not rigid if the function

f f′
r

+

1 − f 2
r2

is non zero at r. It means that there exists some smooth perturbation convex body
isometric to the r sphere but their second fundamental forms are diﬀerent. If every
r sphere is rigid, then the ambient space should be space form.

Since the scalar curvature is only determined by metric, the Alexandrov’s type
theorem for constant scalar curvature in general warped product space is also not
right.

The reason why these examples exist is that the kernel of the linearized problem
is six dimensional, but for the ambient space, the isometry group is of less than six
dimension in general. See section 7 for more explanation. It suggested us that we
need to restrict its geometric center to remove the ”moving” directions. Hence we
introduce the following condition:

Condition: Suppose Σ is a hypersurface and ~r is its position vector. We require

(1.6)

~rdσ = 0,

ZΣ

where dσ is the volume element of Σ.

Now we can recover the rigidity for sphere under the above condition.

Theorem 5. Suppose manifold M is a n− 1 dimensional topological sphere and g is
some Einstein metric with positive constant scalar curvature on M . If (M, g) can be
isometrically embedded into n dimensional warped product space and the embedded
hypersurface Σ is σ2-convex, star shaped and satisfying condition (1.6), then Σ is a
slice sphere.

In the last part, we discuss some application for our theorem. We will prove some
inequality similar to Shi-Tam in asymptotic ﬂat manifolds, namely, the warped
function deﬁned by (1.5) with κ = 0.

Theorem 6. Suppose Ω is a mean convex and simply connected domain in some
3 dimensional Riemannian manifold. Σ0 is its boundary. We also assume that the
induced metric on Σ0 is in the neighborhood of the canonical sphere metric with
radius r > m. Then Σ0 can be isometrically embedded in Schwarzschild manifold
with mass m and we have the following inequality

(1.7)

(H0 − H)f (~r)dσ0 +

m
2 ≥ 0.

ZΣ0

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

5

Here H0, H are the mean curvature of Σ0 in Schwarzschild manifold and original
Riemannian manifold. ~r is the position vector of the isometric embedding. f is the
warped function. The equality will hold if the Σ0 is an asymptotic Euclidean ball.

We also calculate the example constructed in Theorem 4, and it seems that (1.7)

holds even if m is droped in the example.

The paper is divided into ten sections. Section 2 gives a brief review some basic
formulas in warped product space. Section 3 solves the linearized problem. Section
4 proves the openness theorem. Section 5 discusses some existence results.
In
section 6, we revisit the inﬁnitesimal problem in space form. Section 7 gives the
non inﬁnitesimal rigidity and non rigidity in general warped product space.
In
section 8, the counterexample of non rigidity spheres in high dimensional spaces
is constructed. Section 9 gives the proof of Theorem 5.
In section 10, we give
In the last section, more detailed calculation on the
a Shi-Tam type inequality.
counterexamples is presented.

2. The connection and curvature in warped product spaces

In n dimensional space, by (1.3), we write the warped product metric

ds2 =

dr2 + r2(

cos2 θi−1 ··· cos2 θ1dθ2

n−1

Xi=1

where(r, θ1,··· , θn−1) is the polar coordinate.
In this paper, we always use · to
present the metric in the ambient space. We use D as the Levi-Civita connection
with respect to the metric ds2. Suppose X, Y are two vector ﬁelds in warped product
space. We deﬁne the curvature tensor

¯R(X, Y ) = DXDY − DY DX − D[X,Y ].

3. The linearized problem

In this section, we try to study the linearized problem in three dimensional warped
product space. In three dimensional case, the metric of the ambient space can be
rewritten as

ds2 =

1

f 2(r)

dr2 + r2(dθ2 + cos2 θdϕ2).

We will use · to denote this metric. The isometric embedding problem is to ﬁnd
some position vector ﬁelds ~r to satisfy the following system

where (S2, g) is some two dimensional sphere with given metric g. The linearized
problem is the following system, for any two symmetric tensor q,

d~r · d~r = g,

d~r · Dτ = q,

where τ is the variation of ~r and D is the Levi-Civita connection with respect to
ds2. Now, let’s check the above system. In fact, for a family of surfaces ~rt : S2 7→ R3
we have

Taking derivative with respect to t, we have

d~rt · d~rt = gt.

Hence, it suﬃces to check that

(cid:18) ∂

∂t

d~rt · d~rt(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

= 2d~r · (D ∂

Let

ω = τ · d~r = u1dx1 + u2dx2,

where ui = τ · ~ri, φ = τ · ν and ν is the unit normal of the surface ~r. Denote the
connection on S2 with respect to the metric g by ∇, then we have
(3.1)

∇ω = dui ⊗ dxi + ui∇dxi

= ~ri · Dτ ⊗ dxi + τ · D~ri ⊗ dxi + ui∇dxi
= ~ri · Djτ dxi ⊗ dxj + τ · ∇ri ⊗ dxi + τ · D⊥~rj~ridxj ⊗ dxi + ui∇dxi.

By the deﬁnition of the second fundamental form, we have

By the deﬁnition of the connection, we have

D⊥~rj~ri = hijν.

Since Γk

ij = Γk

ji, we have

∇~ri = Γk

ij~rk ⊗ dxj.

(3.2)

∇ω = ~ri · Djτ dxi ⊗ dxj + φhijdxi ⊗ dxj
mldxm ⊗ dxl

ijukdxj ⊗ dxi − uiΓi

+Γk

= (~ri · Djτ + φhij)dxi ⊗ dxj.
The above equation is equivalent to the following system

(3.3)

q22 + φh22
Denote the symmetrization operator by Sym, namely

u2,2

u1,1

q11 + φh11



Sym : T ∗S2 ⊗ T ∗S2 7→ Sym(T ∗S2 ⊗ T ∗S2).

.

Then we deﬁne an operator

L : T ∗S2

7→ Sym(T ∗S2 ⊗ T ∗S2)

L(ω) = Sym(∇ω).

Hence (3.3) becomes

Taking trace with respect to h, we have

L(ω) = q + φh.

trh(∇ω) = hijui,j = trh(q) + 2φ.

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

Then we have

φ =

trh(∇ω − q)

.

For convenience, deﬁne a new operator

(3.4)

Lh(ω) = L(ω) −

trh(∇ω)

2

h = q −

trh(q)

2

h,

which is a map from cotangent bundle to symmetric 2-tensor product of cotangent
bundle. We claim that Lh is a strong elliptic operator. For ξ = (ξ1, ξ2), |ξ| = 1, if
the principal symbol of the operator Lh is zero, namely

σ(Lh) = 0,

which implies

(3.5)

u1ξ2 + u2ξ1 − 2ηh12 = 0
= 0

u1ξ1 − ηh11
u2ξ2 − ηh22

,




ξ1

where 2η = hijuiξj. If ξ1, ξ2 6= 0, then u1 = ηh11/ξ1 and u2 = ηh22/ξ2. Hence we
have

ξ2h11

0 = η(

+

ξ1h22
ξ2 − 2h12) =

η

det hξ1ξ2

(hijξiξj).

Since h is positive deﬁnite, we get η = 0 which implies u1 = u2 = 0. If ξ1 = 0, then
η = 0 and ξ2 6= 0. Furthermore, by the third equality of (3.5), we have u2 = 0. By
the second equality of (3.5), we also have u1 = 0. Hence the operator Lh is a strong
elliptic operator on compact manifold.

Since the strong elliptic operator is a Fredholm operator, we know that

coker(Lh) = ker(L∗h).

Hence to prove the solvability of the linearized problem, it suﬃces to show that the
kernel of L∗h is zero. Let’s compute the adjoint operator. At ﬁrst deﬁne some inner
product space H

H := {a ∈ C∞(Sym(T ∗S2 ⊗ T ∗S2)); trh(a) = 0}

equipped with the inner product

(a, b) =ZS2

KhijhmnaimbjndVg

for a, b ∈ H, where K is σ2 curvature for surface ~r in ambient space, namely

det h
det g
We also deﬁne the inner product in C∞(T ∗S2),

K =

(ω, η) =ZS2

KhijωiηjdVg

for ω, η ∈ C∞(T ∗S2).

The adjoint operator L∗h is deﬁned by

(ω, L∗h(a)) = (Lh(ω), a).

10

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

Then we have

(3.6)

(Lh(ω), a) = ZS2

Khijhmnui,majndVg +

(Khijhmnajn),muidVg.

2ZS2

Ktrh(∇ω)hijhmnhimajndVg

where we have used hijaij = 0. Hence the dual operator is
(L∗h(a))k = −(Khijhmnajn),mhik.

Thus L∗h(a) = 0 implies

(Khijhmnajn),m = 0.

Let Aij be the cofactor of hij, the previous equation is

(Aijhmnajn),m = 0.

For i = 1, the above equation can be written as

0 = (A11h1na1n + A12h1na2n),1 + (A11h2na1n + A12h2na2n),2
= (−A11h2na2n + A12h1na2n),1 + (A11h2na1n − A12h1na1n),2
= (−h22h2na2n − h12h1na2n),1 + (h22h2na1n + h12h1na1n),2
= −(δ2na2n),1 + (δ2na1n),2
= a21,2 − a22,1,

where we have used hijaij = 0 in the second equality. A similar argument yields

Then we obtain, for k = 1, 2,

a11,2 = a12,1.

ak1,2 = ak2,1.

Hence the tensor a satisfy homogenous linearized Gauss-Codazzi system

(3.7)

(cid:26) hijaij = 0

aij,k = aik,j

.

In what follows, we will prove that (3.7) has trivial solution only which implies
ker(L∗h) = 0.

Let’s deﬁne cross product × induced by arbitrary inner product ·. It is a standard
procedure. Once we ﬁx an orientation, for any two vector a, b, the cross product is
the unique bilinear map satisfying the following two properties:

(3.8)

a × b · a = a × b · b = 0;|a × b|2 = (a · a)(b · b) − (a · b)2.

It is easy to check that the following triple scalar product formula holds for any
vectors a, b, c,

We deﬁne some (1, 1) tensor related to the linearized Gauss-Codazzi system. Let

a × b · c = a · b × c.

Ak = gijakiν × ~rj,

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

where ν is the unit normal of surface ~r and in the direction of ~r1 × ~r2. By (3.8), Ak
is a tangential vector. Deﬁne

(3.9)

Ω = Ak ⊗ dxk,

then Ω is a (1, 1) tensor on sphere S2. More precisely, by (3.8) and triple scalar
product formula, we have

Lemma 7. For any vector E in ambient space satisfying

we can deﬁne some 1- form on S2

ω = Ω · E = Ak · Edxk.

Then ω is a closed form, and in fact it is zero.

Proof. It is obvious that ω is a one form. Then

dω = ∂j(Ak · E)dxj ∧ dxk

= (DjAk · E + Ak · DjE)dxj ∧ dxk

We will ﬁnd some special solutions to (3.11).

Lemma 8. Suppose the coordinate for R3 are {z1, z2, z3}. Let

Eα =

∂
∂zα ×E ~r,

where ×E is the cross product induced by Euclidean metric, then Eα satisfy (3.11)
for α = 1, 2, 3. And we also have

where X is the conformal Killing vector.

Eα =

∂
∂zα × X,

Proof. In view of the discussion in the procedure to derive the linear equation. We
only need to construct some family of embedding ~rt, such that

d~rt · d~rt = d~r · d~r.

Then E = d~rt
dt |t=0 satisﬁes (3.11). It is obvious that the warped product space is
rotationally symmetric. Explicitly, for any orthogonal matrix A, we always have
A~r · A~r = ~r · ~r. Let O(3) be the orthogonal group in dimension 3. We know that the
Lie algebra o(3) of O(3) is the collection of all 3 × 3 anti-symmetric matrices. It is
well known that o(3) is 3 dimensional and its basis can be expressed by Eα. Thus
for any Eα, we always can ﬁnd some family of orthogonal matrices At, which is a
path generated by Eα from the identity matrix I in O(3) using exponential map.
Let

~rt = At~r,

we have

which implies that Eα satisfy (3.11).

d~rt · d~rt = Atd~r · Atd~r = d~r · d~r,

The conformal Killing vector ﬁeld is deﬁned by (2.8). In fact, we will prove, for

any vector a,

a ×E ~r = a × X.
Suppose the polar coordinate is (r, θ, ϕ), and write

which is perpendicular to a, ~r. Thus a ×E ~r is parallel to a × X. Then we obtain

|a × X|2 = |a|2|X|2 − (a · X)2 = r2f 2(ζ 2 cos2 θ + η2) = |a ×E ~r|2.

The claim is proved.

(cid:3)

The support function in warped product space is deﬁned by

ϕ(p) = X · ν,

where ν is the unit outward normal of surface ~r and X is deﬁned by (2.8). We also
deﬁne another set

m0 = {~r(p) = 0; p ∈ S2}.

Since ~r is regular surface, m0 is a ﬁnite set by the compactness of sphere. We have
the following fact,
Proposition 9. The set Z = {ϕ(p) = 0; p ∈ S2 \ m0} is a regular curve on sphere.
Proof. We only need to check that on Z, dϕ 6= 0. Since X is a conformal Killing
vector, we have

∂iϕ = DiX · ν + X · Din = f~ri · ν + X · Diν = X · Diν.

Note that

Thus we get

Diν · ~rj = −ν · Di~rj = −hij.

Since X · ν = 0 on Z, we can assume X = ai~ri. Then we have

Diν = −gklhik~rl.

∂iz = −akhik = 0,

which implies ak = 0, namely X = 0. Hence we know that ~r(p) = 0 which contra-
dicts to p /∈ m0.
(cid:3)

We are in the position to prove the following Theorem.

Theorem 10. Suppose ~r is a strictly convex surface in warped product space. For
any (0, 2) symmetric tensor q, there always exists some vector ﬁeld τ satisfying the
following equation,

d~r · Dτ = q.

Proof. By the previous discussion, it suﬃces to prove ker(L∗h) = 0 which is equivalent
to prove Ω = 0 where Ω is the (1, 1) tensor deﬁned in (3.9). By Lemma 7 and Lemma
8, for α = 1, 2, 3, we have, on the whole sphere,

Since for any three vector a, b, c, we always have

Ω · Eα = 0, and Ω · ν = 0.

(a × b) × c = b(a · c) − a(b · c).

For any vector X 6= 0, we always can ﬁnd α0 6= β0 such that

Eα0, Eβ0 and ν are linearly independent which implies, on S2 \ (Z ∪ m0),

Ω = 0.

Note that Z ∪ m0 is a closed set without interior points. Hence Ω is zero on the
whole sphere. Thus we complete our proof.

4. The openness

Using Theorem 10, we can give the proof of the openness Theorem 1 for the Weyl
problem. Assume that ~r is the isometric embedding of (S2, g) in ambient space.
Following the Nirenberg’s approach, we need to ﬁnd some vector ﬁeld ~y, such that

d(~r + ~y) · d(~r + ~y) = ˜g,

where ˜g is the perturbation of g. We rewrite the isometric system in local coordinate
of sphere {x1, x2} and ambient space {z1, z2, z3},

We conclude that (4.1) is equivalent to the following inhomogeneous inﬁnitesimal-
deformation type equations

(4.5)

d~r · D~y = q(~y,∇~y).

The above calculation has been exhibited in [24] at ﬁrst. Note that
kFαβγλkCm,α(S2) + kGαβγkCm,α(S2) ≤ Cm,αk~ykCm,α(S2),

where k · kCm,α(S2) is the H¨older norm on 2 sphere.
Theorem 10 tells us that, for any given symmetric tensor q, system (4.5) always
can be solved. In what follows, we will make use of contraction mapping theorem
to obtain some solution to (4.5). We deﬁne some map Φ,
7→ C 2,α(S2),
7→ ~y,

Φ : C 2,α(S2)
~z

where ~y = Φ(~z) is the solution to (4.5) with q = q(~z,∇~z). We need a priori estimate
for the solution to (4.5).
Similar to the previous section, an elliptic system (3.3) can be derived from (4.5)

for

We need its H¨older estimate.

ω = ~y · d~r = uidxi.

Takeing derivatives of system (3.4), we obtain some second order elliptic partial
diﬀerential system. Using the interior Schauder estimate of elliptic system [13], we
have

kωkC 2,α(S2) ≤ C2,α(kqkC 1,α(S2) + kωkC 0,α(S2)).

A compactness argument implies, for ω orthogonal to the kernel of the system (3.3),

(4.6)

ku1kC 2,α(S2) + ku2kC 2,α(S2) ≤ C2,αkqkC 1,α(S2).

Here, the constant C2,α only depends on the upper and lower bound of the principal
curvatures κ1, κ2 of the strictly convex surface ~r and the upper bound of the deriva-
tives of the curvature. See also Vekua [38] for another proof of the above inequality.
In what follows, we will modify Nirenberg’s trick [29] to improve the regularity of
the function φ = ~y · ν where ν is the unit outer normal of the surface ~r. Let

It is not diﬃcult to see that the above equation is an elliptic equation, if hij is
positive deﬁnite.

Remark 11. In fact, the above equation (4.10) is the linearized Gauss equation.
Since the tensor q is the linearization of the metric tensor, the curvature type tensor
of q appears in the right hand side of (4.10)

Using (4.6), (4.10) and H¨older estimates of solutions to elliptic equation, we have

the following lemma,

Lemma 12. For 0 < α < 1 and any given symmetric tensor q, suppose ~y is any
solution to (4.5). Then, we have the following estimate

k~ykC 2,α(S2) ≤ C(kqkC 1,α(S2) + kq12,12 − q11,22 − q22,11 + q12,21kC α(S2)),

where C is constant depending on α and Σ.

For any vector ﬁeld ~z on the embedded surface ~r, we take q = q(~z,∇~z) deﬁned by
(4.4). Since the term q12,12 − q11,22 − q22,11 + q12,21 is the linearized Gauss curvature,
it does not include any third order derivatives of ~z. By (4.4), in every term of qij

18

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

except the term ˜gij − gij, the vector ~z appears at least two times. Thus by the
deﬁnition of map Φ, Lemma 12 implies

(4.11)

kΦ(~z)kC 2,α(S2)

For any number δ < 1, let

Bδ = {~z some vector ﬁeld on the surface ~r;k~zkC 2,α(S2) ≤ δ}.

If we take suﬃcient small ǫ and δ, the map Φ is well deﬁned in Bν by (4.11). We
want to prove that the map Φ is a contraction map. Suppose ~z1, ~z2 ∈ Bδ, and

q = q(~z1,∇~z1) − q(~z2,∇~z2).

By (4.4) we have

If we choose suﬃcient small δ, then map Φ is a contraction map which implies that
there exists one solution to (4.5). We completes the proof of Theorem 1.

A direct corollary of the openness theorem is the following openness in conformal

ﬂat space.

Corollary 13. Suppose ds2 is the symmetric conformal ﬂat metric in R3. Namely,
there is some positive function φ(r) satisfying (rφ(r))′ > 0, such that

ds2 = φ2(r)(dr2 + r2dS2

2 ).

Then for some metric g on 2 sphere, if it can be isometrically embedded into (R3, ds2)
as some strictly convex surface, then the perturbation metric ˜g of g also can be
isometrically embedded into the conformal space (R3, ds2) as another strictly convex
surface.

Proof. The metric can be rewrite to the warped product metric (1.3). By openness
theorem, we obtain our result.
(cid:3)

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

5. Discussion of the existence results

Using the openness theorem, we can prove some existence theorem for AdS space.
The metric of the AdS space is deﬁned by (1.5), so it is a asymptotic Euclidean or
hyperbolic space.
Theorem 14. For any metric g on S2, if its Gaussian curvature K > −κ, then it
can be isometrically embedded into AdS space with κ and any m. More precisely,
(S2, g) always can be isometrically embedded as a surface outside some large ball BR
in AdS space.

Proof. Using the isometric embedding theorems in space form, we know that, the
metric g can be embedded into space form with the sectional curvature κ. We
translate ~r to out of some suﬃcient large ball BR where ~r is the position vector of
the embedded surface. Let gR be the induced metric on ~r, we have

C
R

,

kg − gRkC 3,α(S2) ≤
where C is some constant not depending on R.
In what follows we will prove
the second fundamental form of the surfaces ~r outside BR are uniformly bounded.
Denote the second fundamental form of ~r in space form and AdS space outside BR
by h, hR respectively. We also denote the unit normal and Levi-Civita connection
with respect to space form and AdS space by νκ, ν and ∇κ,∇. Meanwhile we assume
the local coordinate of sphere {x1, x2}, then it is not very diﬃcult to check that

kν − νκkC 2,α(S2) ≤

, and k∇κ

i ~rj − ∇i~rjkC 2,α(S2) ≤

C
R

C
R

.

Hence we have

kh − hRkC 2,α(S2) ≤

C
R

,

where C is still some constant independent of R. Thus, the constant appears in the
proof of the openness theorem 1 is uniformly bounded. If we choose R suﬃcient
large, the map Φ still is a contraction map. Hence metric g is in the ǫ neighborhood
of some gR where ǫ is the constant appears in Theorem 1. So by openness, there is
some isometric embedding convex surface for metric g.
(cid:3)

For the sake of completeness, we rough review some existence results obtained by
Guan- Lu [11] and Lu [27]. In fact the above existence theorem is a corollary of the
openness theorem . For further discussion about existence results, we need a priori
estimates, i.e. the estimate of the Gauss equation

κ1κ2 =

¯R
2

+ K − ¯Ric(ν, ν).

where K is the Gauss curvature. The following Heinz type C 2 a prior estimate has
been found by Lu [27].

Theorem 15. Suppose (S2, g) is isometrically embedded into some ambient Reiman-
nian manifold (N 3, ¯g) such that it is null homologous. Let X be some isometric

20

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

embedding. Assume that

R(x) − ¯R(X(x)) + 2 inf{RicX(x)(µ, µ) : µ ∈ TX(x)U,|µ| = 1} ≥ C0 > 0,

for any x ∈ S2 where C0 is a positive constant. Further assume that ¯R ≥ −6κ2
and R > −2κ2 for some constant κ. Then the mean curvature H of the embedded
surface is bounded from above,

where C is a positive constant depending on C0, inf(R + 2κ2),kgkC 3 and k¯gkC 3 , but
not on the position of the embedded surface.

H ≤ C,

Now, we have some existence result for warped product space with no singularity.

Assume that there is some universal constant K0 such that

(5.1)

(a) lim sup
r→∞

1 − f 2
r2 ≤ K0,

(b) lim sup

r→∞−

1 − f 2 + 2rf f′

≤ K0.

With the above condition, there exists some constant K1 depending on f and K0
such that

(5.2)

1 − f 2
r2

,−

max{

1 − f 2 + 2rf f′

r2

} ≤ K1.

Hence we can brief review the proof of the Theorem 2 in [11], [27] .

Proof of Theorem 2: We use continuity method to obtain the existence result.
At ﬁrst, we use normalized Ricci ﬂow on S2 to create some path to connect the
given metric g and some standard metric with constant Gauss curvature bigger than
K0. See [16] for more detail. The assumption (a) and (b) in (5.1) can preserve the
strictly convex of the family of surface deﬁned by the Ricci ﬂow. The constant Gauss
curvature surface always can be isometrically embedded in the warped product space
as some small enough geodesic sphere if there is no singularity. Thus it remains
to prove the openness and closeness. Openness has been obtained in Theorem
1. For the C 2 estimates, we need to check the conditions of Theorem 15. Let
C0 = 2(minS2 K − K1), and choose suﬃcient large κ, we have R = 2K > −2κ2. By
(2.5) and (5.1), we have

¯R = 2(

2f f′

r

+

f 2 − 1
r2

) ≥ −6K1.

Thus choosing suﬃcient large κ, we also have ¯R > −6κ2. Therefore we obtain
the C 2 a prior estimate independent of the position of the embedded surface. The
C 1 estimate directly comes from the isometric embedding system.
It remians to
establish C 0 estimate for completing the proof. The curvature estimate implies that
the principal curvatures are bounded. Hence along the path, by deﬁnition of the
variation τ , we have

Using the Schauder estimate (4.6), we have the uniform bound for τ , which implies
uniform bound for ~rt. We complete the proof of Theorem 2.

~rt = ~r0 +Z t

6. The infinitesimal rigidity in space form

In this section, we will revisit the inﬁnitesimal rigidity of the isometric embedding
problem for convex hypersurfaces in space form. At ﬁrst, we reprove the inﬁnitesimal
rigidity for convex surface in R3 only using the maximum principle. Then using
Beltrami map, we can generalize to the space form cases.

As in section 3, the inﬁnitesimal problem of the isometric embedding problem is

to consider the following linear system: for any given convex surface ~r,

(6.1)

d~r · dτ = 0.
Obviously, there is some vector Y such that

(6.2)

dτ = Y × d~r.

Diﬀerentiating the above equation, we have

which implies dY is parallel to the tangent plane. hence we can assume

d2τ = dY × dr = 0,

d~r = ~ridxi, dY = Yidxi and Yi = W k

i ~rk.

By dY × dr = 0 we have

which implies

W k

equation of second order of Y · E. Then the strong maximum principle tells us Y · E
is constant which implies Y is a constant vector.

Hence, we have the well known inﬁnitesimal rigidity in Euclidean space.

Proposition 16. In three dimensional Euclidean space, the solutions to (6.1) are

where A, B are two constant vectors.

The paper [24] discusses the inﬁnitesimal rigidity problem of the convex surfaces
in hyperbolic three space. In fact, we can use Beltrami map to turn the inﬁnitesimal
rigidity problem in space forms to the one in Euclidean space.

(cid:3)

.

Using these preliminaries, we can prove the Theorem 3.

Proof of Theorem 3. It’s divided into three cases. For Euclidean space, Propo-
sition 16 says that τ, the solutions to (6.1), are generated by the Lie algebra of the
Lie group O(3)× R3 which is the isometry group of the three dimensional Euclidean
space.
For the hyperbolic space case, the previous discussion shows that we have two

constant vectors Y, Z in R3, such that

A = Y ×E ¯r + x0Z,

where ×E is the cross product of Euclidean space. Hence, we have

τ = (x0Z ∗ ¯r, Y ×E ¯r + x0Z).

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

25

since the
Denote the Beltrami map by p, the pre image of
coordinate of R3 is x1, x2, x3. Let X = p∗¯r, Y0 = p∗Y, Z0 = p∗Z. It is easy to check
that

∂x0

∂

is Ei = xi
x0

∂

+ ∂
∂xi

τ = x0Y0 × X + x0Z0,

where × is the cross product in hyperbolic space. The result was proved by Lin-
Wang [24] at ﬁrst. It is also obvious that τ is generated by the Lie algebra of the
isometry group of Minkowski space R1,3 restricted to hyperboloid, see [22] for more
detail.

The third case is sphere space. It is well known that any strictly convex surface in
three sphere is included in some hemisphere by Bonnet-Myers theorem [28]. We pose
the radius 1/κ three sphere in R4. Let its coordinate be x0, x1, x2, x3. Without loss of
generality, assume the ambient space is the upper hemisphere, namely x0 ≥ 0. Using
the Beltami map, we project the hemisphere to its equator hyperplane {x1, x2, x3}.
Then, using the parameters x1, x2, x3, the metric can be rewritten by (1.3) with the
warped function f = √1 − κr2. A similar argument in hyperbolic case shows the

solutions to the inﬁnitesimal problem also are

τ = x0Y0 × X + x0Z0.

The meaning of ×, X, Y0, Z0 are similar except x0 = p1 − x2

3. The so-
lutions also are generated by the Lie algebra of the Lie group O(4), which is the
isometry group of the three sphere. We complete the proof.

2 − x2

1 − x2

Remark 19. The previous discussion also can be generalized into the hypersurface
in high dimensional space form. Since we have more algebraic relations exhibited
in Gauss equations, the convexity can be weakened to the condition that the rank of
the second fundamental form matrix is equal to or great than two. This result was
proved by Dajczer-Rodriguez in [9] at ﬁrst. More material about the inﬁnitesimal
rigidity for hypersurface can be found in [8].

At the end of the section, we would like to point out another fact which is very

natural.

Remark 20. In space form, the linear system
d~r · Dτ = q
can be rewritten as inhomogeneous type of (6.9)
q

.

Hence the solvability of the former linear system in Euclidean space implies the one
in space form. The Euclidean space case has been done in [29]. As a direct corollary,
the linear system is always solvable in space form.

7. The non infinitesimal rigidity and non rigidity

An important corollary of the inﬁnitesimal rigidity in the space form is that we
can calculate the dimension of the kernel of the linearized equation (3.3) discussed
in section 3.

26

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

Theorem 21. Suppose ~r is a strictly convex surface in any three dimensional warped
product space. The dimension of the solution space to the linear homogeneous equa-
tion

(7.1)

d~r · Dτ = 0,

is always six, where τ is a smooth vector ﬁeld in warped product space deﬁned on
sphere.

Proof. In section 3, we have shown that the dimension of the solution space to (7.1)
is the dimension of the ker Lh deﬁned by (3.4). By the discussion of the previous
section, we know that it is six in space form. Since the operator Lh is elliptic deﬁned
on the cotangent bundle on sphere for strictly convex surface ~r, it is a Fredholm
operator. Its index is deﬁned by

ind(Lh) = dim ker Lh − dim cokerLh.

In section 3, we have proved Theorem 10 which implies cokerLh = 0 for any three
dimensional warped product space. Hence we have

ind(Lh) = dim ker Lh.

It is well known that the index only depends on the principal symbol of the operator.
Furthermore, for a family of operators L(t), let a(t) be the family of the principal
symbols. Suppose a(t) is invertible, denote its inverse by b(t) and a(t), b(t) both
are uniformly bounded, then the index of these operators are invariant. See [20] for
more detail. In our case, by (3.4) the principal symbol of Lh only depends on the
second fundamental form h. Hence for any given h, we always can choose a path,

ht = (1 − t)h + tg0,

where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 and g0 is the canonical metric on sphere whose Gauss curvature is
constant 1. In view of (3.5), the principal symbol of the operators deﬁned by ht are
uniformly bounded. The inverse of these principal symbol are
12q11 − ht
12q22 − ht

12ξ1ξ2,

where ξ is some unit cotangent vector and q is symmetric (0, 2) tensor with trhtq = 0.
Obviously, the inverse principal symbols (7.2) are also uniformly bounded. Thus the
index of the operator Lh is same as Lg0. We can view the Lg0 as the unit sphere
embedded in Euclidean space. Hence by the inﬁnitesimal rigidity discussed in the
previous section,

ind (Lg0) = 6, which implies

dim ker Lh = 6.

(cid:3)

A corollary of the above theorem is the following non inﬁnitesimal rigidity.

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

27

Corollary 22. If the sectional curvature of three dimensional warped product space
is not constant, namely

f (r)f′(r)

r

+

1 − f 2(r)

r2

6= 0,

for any embedded strictly convex surface ~r, it isn’t inﬁnitesimally rigid.

Proof. There are some well known facts about the isometry group of any n Reiman-
nian manifold. It is a Lie group and its dimension is at most n(n + 1)/2. If the di-
mension achieves n(n + 1)/2, it should be some constant sectional curvature space.
See [22] and [10] for more explanation.
In our case, since our three dimensional
warped space is not space form, the dimension of the isometry group is less than six
which implies the dimension of its Lie algebra is also less than six. The discussion in
section 3 tells us that for any A in the Lie algebra, τ generated by A is the solution
to (7.1). But the previous theorem tell us that the kernel of the linear equation (7.1)
is always six. Hence there is some solution to (7.1) which doesn’t come from the Lie
algebra, namely it’s nontrivial solution. Hence convex surface is not inﬁnitesimally
rigid any more.
(cid:3)

In view of the proof of the openness, we can use the previous corollary to obtain

the non rigidity for any strictly convex surface.

Theorem 23. In any three dimensional warped product space which is not a space
form, for any embedded strictly convex surface, it isn’t rigid.

Proof. By the previous corollary, there exists some vector ﬁeld T , which is the
solution of (7.1), such that there is no action A in the Lie algebra of the isometry
group satisfying T = A~r. In what follows, we will generate a family of isometric
strictly convex surfaces ~rǫ by the vector ﬁeld T. Let
~rǫ = ~r + ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ

where Tǫ is some undetermined vector ﬁeld. As required, ~rǫ satisfy isometric system

As discussed in section 4, we have a system similar to (4.5),

d~rǫ · d~rǫ = d~r · d~r.

which implies

d~r · D(ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ) = q(ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ,∇(ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ)),

d~r · DTǫ =

1
ǫ2 q(ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ,∇(ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ)).

We will repeat the argument in the proof of the openness to ﬁnd the solution Tǫ to
the above nonlinear system. We deﬁne some map using the previous system,

F : C 2,α(S2)
Tǫ

7→ C 2,α(S2),
7→ T ∗ǫ ,

where T ∗ǫ is the solution to

d~r · DT ∗ǫ =

1
ǫ2 q(ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ,∇(ǫT + ǫ2Tǫ)),

28

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

and perpendicular to the kernel of (3.3). By Theorem 10, the previous system is
solvable and then we can ﬁnd unique solution T ∗ǫ which is perpendicular to the
kernel of (3.3), thus the map F is well deﬁned. Then, by (4.11) we have

(7.3)

kF (Tǫ)kC 2,α(S2)
≤ C1(kT + ǫTǫk2

C 2,α(S2) + ǫkT + ǫTǫk3

C 2,α(S2) + ǫ2kT + ǫTǫk4

C 2,α(S2)).

We let C2 = 2C1kTk2
C 2,α(S2) and use the notation BC2 deﬁned in section 4. The
previous estimates tell us that the map F is from BC2 to BC2 for suﬃcient small ǫ.
Using the explicit expression of qij in section 4, we also have

kF (T 1

ǫ ) − F (T 2

ǫ )kC 2,α(S2) ≤ CǫkT 1

ǫ − T 2

ǫ kC 2,α(S2),

ǫ , T 2

for T 1
ǫ in BC2. If we choose suﬃcient small ǫ, the map F is a contraction map.
Then, by contraction mapping theorem, we obtain the family of strictly convex
surfaces ~rǫ.

We claim there is some ǫ0 such that ~rǫ0 can not move to the surface ~r by some
isometry of the ambient space. If it is not true, we can ﬁnd a family of isometry gǫ
of the ambient space such that

~rǫ = gǫ~r.

Then we can take derivative with respect to ǫ, and letting ǫ = 0, we ﬁnd that
the vector ﬁeld T is an inﬁnitesimal isometry vector ﬁeld, which contradicts to our
assumption. Thus ~rǫ0 is isometric to the surface ~r but cannot move to ~r by some
isometry of the ambient space.
(cid:3)

Maybe, we can propose another type of rigidity. At ﬁrst, let us see some example.

In (1.3), if we choose the following warped function in R3,

(7.4)

f (r) =(cid:26)1, if 0 ≤ r ≤ r0

g(r), if r > r0

,

where r0 is some given positive number and g(r) is arbitrary positive function.
Then if there is some convex surface contained in the ball Br0, the translation of the
surface in the ball will not change the shape of the surface. But if the function g is
non trivial, the warped product space deﬁned by (7.4) is not a space form. Hence,
by the previous theorem the convex surface in Br0 is still not rigid.

If the requirement is more detail, we can ﬁnd some counterexample that the
perturbation surface do not have the same shape, namely same second fundamental
form. We will discuss it in the next section.

8. The non rigidity for spheres

In this section, we will try to ﬁnd some counterexample for the isometric embed-
ding problem in any dimensional space. More precisely, we will ﬁnd some convex
body in n dimensional warped product space which is isometric to unit slice sphere,
but its second fundamental form is not same as the slice sphere. The method we

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

29

will apply here is to follow similar tricks in the openness. Hence we need to discuss
the linearized equation

(8.1)
in Rn equipped with the metric

2d~r · Dτ = q,

ds2 =

1

f 2(r)

dr2 + r2dSn−1.

Similar to Section 3, we can rewrite this system as

(8.2)

vi,j + vj,i = 2φhij + qij,

where ω =Pi vidxi, vi = τ ·~ri is the 1-form on sphere, φ = τ ·ν and q is a symmetric

(0, 2) tensor on sphere. By (2.10), we have

φhij =

f 2(r)

r

∂
∂r

gij =

where ·E is the inner product of Euclidean space. Let φE = τ ·E νE and hE
second fundamental form of r sphere in Euclidean space, then we have

ij be the

ui,j + uj,i = 2φEhE

ij + qij.

That means for any slice sphere the system (8.1) can be viewed in Euclidean space.
Now we write down it in polar coordinate. Let (u1, u2,··· , un−1) be the sphere
coordinate and (r, θ1, θ2,··· , θn−1) be the polar coordinate in ambient space, We
present the radius r sphere in warped product space by the map

~r(u1,··· , un−1)

= r(cos u1 cos u2 ··· cos un−1, cos u1 cos u2 ··· cos un−2 sin un−1,··· , sin u1).

Hence r is constant and θi = ui. It is obvious that

Now we are in the position to give the proof of Theorem 4 for non rigidity of

geodesic spheres.

Proof of Theorem 4. The above calculation implies that the C k hypersurface
deﬁned by (8.18) is isometric to the r sphere.
In fact, we can show that it is
smooth. By (2.6) the Gauss equations for the hypersurfce is

σ2(hij) =

(n − 1)(n − 2)

2rn−1

+

¯R
2 − ¯Ric(ν, ν).

Using the orthonormal frame {u1,··· , un−1}, the second fundamental form is

hij =

1
f ϕ

(−ρi,j +

fρ
f

ρiρj + f 2gij),

where ϕ = X · ν is support function. We can assume the hypersurface is at least
C 3. By the standard regularity theory of the solutions to linear elliptic PDEs, we
have the smoothness of ρ which implies the smoothness of hij. Since we have

Yi,j = Γk

ijYk + hijν,

we get the smoothness of Y .

Let’s calculate the second fundamental form of the hypersurface deﬁned by (8.18).

Note that

we have

= r2 + 2rǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2),

hence we have

|Y | =pr2 + 2rǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2) = r + ǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2).

Since h∗ is estimated independent of ǫ, we can choose ǫ suﬃcient small such that
the ﬁrst order term of ǫ is dominate. As known,

ρi,j = ∂2

uiuj ρ − (D ∂

∂ui

we have

(8.20)

ρ1,1 = −rǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2); ρi,j = O(ǫ2) for i 6= j;
ρi,i = −rǫ sin u1Πi−1

j=1 cos2 uj + O(ǫ2) for i 6= 1.

A direct computation shows

ρiρj = O(ǫ2);|∇ρ|2 = O(ǫ2); ϕ =s2ρ − |∇ρ|2
f 2(|Y |)

= r + ǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2).

THE WEYL PROBLEM IN WARPED PRODUCT SPACE

Taylor expansion implies

f (|Y |) = f (r) + f′(r)ǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2),
f 2(|Y |) = f 2(r) + 2f (r)f′(r)ǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2),
uf (|Y |) = rf (r) + (rf′(r) + f (r))ǫ sin u1 + O(ǫ2).

For i 6= j, we have hij = O(ǫ2). For the diagonal term, we have

For suﬃcient small ǫ, we see that the above principal curvature is not same as the
slice sphere case. If every sphere is rigid, the warped function should satisfy

(8.21)

f (r)f′(r)

r

+

1 − f 2(r)

r2

= 0,

for any r. It is well known that the solutions to the above equation are only the
warped functions deﬁning space forms. We complete our proof.

A direct corollary of the above theorem is that A. Ros’s type theorem [35] is not

true in general warped product space, namely

Theorem 26. In n dimensional warped product space, constant scalar curvature
hypersurface is not always some round sphere. More precisely, if (8.21) does not
hold for some r, there exists some perturbation convex body of such r radius slice
sphere with the same constant scalar curvature but diﬀerent second fundamental
form.

Proof. The example in the theorem 4 is isometric to the slice sphere, hence their
scalar curvatures are same, since scalar curvature only determined by metric.
(cid:3)

Remark 27. We also can prove that Y deﬁned by (8.18) has no same second fun-
damental form as a slice sphere in some cases by S. Brendle’s theorem [3]. If Y
has same second fundamental form as a slice sphere, its mean curvature should be
constant, hence it must be a slice sphere by [3]. Obviously, Y is not slice sphere.

The uniqueness of the isometric embedding convex hypersurfaces are true in space
form, [14], [8]. For the high dimensional case, in fact, it’s an algebraic result. It can
be roughly viewed in the following. Assume {e1,··· , en−1} are orthonormal frame
on sphere and moreover diagonalize the second fundamental form, Gauss equation
says, for i 6= j,

λiλj = c + ¯Rijij,

where λi is the principal curvature and R is the curvature tensor. Hence, for three
distinct indices i, j, k, we have

λi =s (c + ¯Rijij)(c + ¯Rikik)

c + ¯Rjkjk

.

36

CHUNHE LI AND ZHIZHANG WANG

Hence λi is totally determined by metric and then we have the uniqueness. The
uniqueness in high dimensional case is a local property, since we have more Gauss
equations. But Theorem 4 tells us that these more algebraic relations are not helpful
in warped product space. It is a little surprising to us.

9. A rigidity theorem for sphere

In the last section some counterexample is constructed for the rigidity problem
of isometric embedding. In this section, we try to recover the rigidity of spheres
under the condition (1.6) which exhibits rotational symmetry and restricts ”moving”
directions hence it is posed to ﬁt the isometry of the ambient space.

For any vector ﬁelds X, Y on the manifold Σ, we also deﬁne its Reimannian

curvature tensor,

R(X, Y ) = ∇X∇Y − ∇Y ∇X − ∇[X,Y ].

i=1 are orthonormal frame on Σ, and en is its unit outward normal.

Suppose {ei}n−1
Let

then the Ricci curvature and scalar curvature are

Rij = glkRilkj =Xk

The Einstein condition means

Rikkj, R = gijRij =Xi

Rii.

(9.1)

Rij = (n − 2)gij = (n − 2)δij .

At ﬁrst, we need some Poinc´are type inequality. By Linchnerowicz’s theorem [31],
for Einstein metric deﬁned by (9.1), the ﬁrst eigenvalue λ1 of the Laplacian with
respect to the metric g on manifold Σ is not less than n− 1. Hence, for any smooth
function χ on Σ satisfying

where dσ is the volume element of Σ, we have the following Poinc´are type inequality

χdσ = 0,

ZΣ

We still use ∗ to denote the inner product of Euclidean space. Let E be some

Let’s calculate the Euclidean norm of ei using polar coordinate. Suppose {E1, E2,··· ,

˜E1 =

E1

Now we are in the position to prove Theorem 5 .

Proof of Theorem 5. Let’s deﬁne some function depending on ρ

φ(ρ) = 2ρ + f 2 − 1.

Since function ρ is deﬁned on some convex body, ρ should vary between its minimum
value and maximum value. Denote the two values by ρmin, ρmax, then ρmin ≤ ρ ≤
ρmax. It is obvious that

By (9.4), we have

φρ = 2(1 + f fρ).

By the assumption of convexity, the right hand side of the above equality is always
positive. At the minimum point of ρ, ∇ρ = 0, we have φ(ρmin) > 0. We claim φ is
always positive between ρmin and ρmax. If it is not true, let ρ0 be the ﬁrst zero of φ
from ρmin, then, at ρ0,

By (9.14), σ2(h) ≤ 0 at ρ = ρ0, since φρ ≤ 0 and φ = 0, which contradicts to
σ2(h) > 0. Thus we always have φ > 0.
Note that (9.13) can be rewritten as

φρ ≤ 0.

By the positivity of φ(ρ) and σ2(h), we obtain ∇ρ = 0. Hence ρ is a constant. Using
(9.12) we have 2ρ = 1 which implies the embedded convex body is a unit geodesic
sphere. We complete our proof.

In three dimension warped product space, obviously, we can have some statement

about constant Gauss curvature.

Corollary 28. In three dimensional warped product space, the only possible embed-
ded convex body of the constant scalar curvature is the slice sphere provided that the
embedded surface satisﬁes condition (1.6).

Proof. Since constant scalar curvature implies the metric on S2 is the standard
metric, an application of Theorem 5 immediately yields the corollary.
(cid:3)

If the warped function f = 1, namely Euclidean space, the above corollary is a

classical rigidity theorem of two dimensional sphere.

space, namely the case

Assume the Ω be a domain bounded by the surface Σ and Ω have nonnegative
scalar curvature. Denote the mean curvature of Σ in Ω by H1. Furthermore, Σ
can be isometrically embedded in asymptotic Euclidean space as some surface Σ0
containing the black hole. Now we consider the geodesic ﬂow

where Φ(t,·) is the position vector and ν is the outward normal vector of the surface
Φ(t,·). Hence, we have some foliation of the space outside the Σ0. The ambient
space metric can be rewritten by

ds2

0 = dt2 + gt,

where gt is the metric on Σt. We try to ﬁnd some conformal metric

ds2 = u2dt2 + gt

with the same scalar curvature as ds2

Using the above explicit formula, we can conclude that the geodesic ﬂow preserves

convexity.

Lemma 30. If the metric on the strictly convex Σ0 is suﬃciently close to a canonical
sphere metric, then for any t > 0, every level surface Σt is always strictly convex.
Proof. Suppose X is the conformal Killing vector, and ϕ = X · ν is the support
function. Hence, we have

Combing (10.5) and (10.4), we have

Solving the above equation, we have

(r2 − ϕ2)t = 0.

where C is a positive constant only depending on Σ0. On the other hand,

ϕ =pr2 − C,
f 2 = 2ρ − |∇ρ|2
ϕ2 = 2ρ − |∇ρ|2
1 − m/r
where ρ = r2/2, which implies C = |∇ρ|2
1−m/r . Note that, if Σ0 is exactly the canonical
sphere, we have C = 0. By continuity, we can require 3C < r2 at t = 0, since Σ0 is
suﬃciently close to the canonical sphere. Obviously, we have

ϕ
|ν × E1|2 = 1 − (ν · E1)2 = 1 − (

Thus we have for any unit tangent direction µ on Σt,

where µ is the corresponding unit principal direction. By (10.6), we have the con-

Now, let’s consider the following quantity,

Deﬁnition 31.

We will see that, if the metric on Σ0 is suﬃciently close to the canonical sphere

metric, we have some monotonicity for Qt.

Lemma 32. The quantity Qt is monotonically decreasing along the geodesic ﬂow.

Proof. The proof is modiﬁed from [37]. Taking the trace of Riccati equation, we
have

11. An example

In the previous section, we have proved some inequality (1.7) for some convex
surfaces. Maybe an interesting problem is that under what restriction, we can drop
the constant m? In this section, we will calculate this quantity using diﬀerent sphere
constructed in section 6 in the same AdS space. It seem that the constant m may
be dropped, if the two surfaces live in a same space.

We use the notation in section 8. Assume {z1, z2, z3} be the standard coordinate
in R3. We will write down the second order approximation of the convex perturba-
