ABSTRACT

Two-thirds of long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) show soft X-ray absorption in excess of the Milky Way. The column densities
of metals inferred from UV and optical spectra diﬀer from those derived from soft X-ray spectra, at times by an order of magnitude,
with the latter being higher. The origin of the soft X-ray absorption excess observed in GRB X-ray afterglow spectra remains a heavily
debated issue, which has resulted in numerous investigations on the eﬀect of hot material both internal and external to the GRB host
galaxy on our X-ray afterglow observations. Nevertheless, all models proposed so far have either only been able to account for a
subset of our observations (i.e. at z > 2), or they have required fairly extreme conditions to be present within the absorbing material.
In this paper, we investigate the absorption of the GRB afterglow by a collisionally ionised and turbulent interstellar medium (ISM).
We ﬁnd that a dense (3 cm−3) collisionally ionised ISM could produce UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities that
diﬀer by a factor of 10, however the UV/optical and soft X-ray absorbing column densities for such sightlines and are 2-3 orders of
magnitude lower in comparison to the GRB afterglow spectra. For those GRBs with a larger soft X-ray excess of up to an order of
magnitude, the contribution in absorption from a turbulent ISM as considered here would ease the required conditions of additional
absorbing components, such as the GRB circumburst medium and intergalactic medium.

1. Introduction
Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; duration (cid:38) 2s; Kou-
veliotou et al. 1993) are thought to originate from the collapse
of rapidly rotating massive stars (25-30 M(cid:12)) (Woosley & Heger
2006) and this is supported by their observed association with
supernovae (SNe) of type I b/c (Galama et al. 1998; Stanek et al.
2003; Hjorth et al. 2003). With luminosities of 1051−52 erg/s over
cosmological distances from z = 0.0085 (Galama et al. 1998)
to z > 8.0 (Tanvir et al. 2009; Salvaterra et al. 2009; Cucchiara
et al. 2011), and emission over most of the electromagnetic spec-
trum, GRBs are excellent probes of the environment of their host
galaxies and any intervening absorbers (Savaglio et al. 2003;
Chen et al. 2005; Fynbo et al. 2006; Savaglio 2006; Prochaska
et al. 2007; Piranomonte et al. 2008; Fynbo et al. 2009; Savaglio
et al. 2012; Zafar et al. 2012; Japelj et al. 2015).

Since the launch of the Swift satellite mission in 2004
(Gehrels et al. 2004) high quality X-ray spectra (0.3 - 10 keV)
of GRB afterglows are now routinely obtained with the X-Ray
Telescope (XRT; Burrows et al. 2004). The rapid arc-second lo-
calisation of GRB afterglows with the XRT, which has a detec-
tion rate of > 95% (Evans et al. 2009), has enabled quick photo-

metric and spectroscopic follow up from ground-based observa-
tories. These follow-up observations have provided the redshift
of the burst and have resulted in high signal-to-noise (S/N) obser-
vations of the absorption features originating from the circum-
burst medium, host galaxy interstellar medium (ISM) and inter-
vening absorbers in UV/optical/NIR afterglow spectra. The col-
umn densities of neutral gas inferred from Lyman-α absorption
in GRB afterglow spectra indicate that a high percentage of GRB
hosts are damped Lyman-α systems (DLAs; NHI > 2 × 1020.0)
or sub-DLAs (1019.0 < NHI < 2 × 1020.0)
(Wolfe et al. 2005;
Prochaska et al. 2007; Fynbo et al. 2008; Savaglio 2012; Sparre
et al. 2014; Cucchiara et al. 2015). Absorption features due to
singly ionised species such as Zn ii, Fe ii, S ii, and Si ii from the
ISM are regularly seen in the GRB UV/optical afterglow spec-
tra. On the basis of temporarily varying lines of singly ionised
species due to photo-excitation by UV afterglow photons, the
absorbing gas can be located at a distance of a few 100 pc from
the GRB progenitor
(e.g. Vreeswijk et al. 2007; D’Elia et al.
2011; Vreeswijk et al. 2013; Hartoog et al. 2013; Krühler et al.
2013). Absorption from highly ionised species within the host
galaxy, such as C iv, N v, O vi and Si iv, are more challenging
to detect because they lie within the Lyman-α forest, and they
have weaker line strengths. However, their detection has been

reported in a dozen GRB afterglows at z > 2 (Prochaska et al.
2008; Fox et al. 2008). The highly ionised species are located
either within the circumburst medium of the GRB, < 20 pc from
the progenitor, or within the ISM at distances of > 400 pc from
the GRB progenitor, and can extend into the halo of the GRB
host (Fox et al. 2008).

The soft X-ray spectra of 60% of GRBs show absorption
in excess of Milky Way absorption (Evans et al. 2009; Cam-
pana et al. 2010, 2012; Starling et al. 2013). However, the nature
and location of the soft X-ray absorbing material is not clear,
since the narrow line absorption/emission features in soft X-ray
spectra are not resolved with the Swift/XRT. Although ASCA
(Tanaka et al. 1994), BeppoSAX (Boella et al. 1997), Chandra
(Weisskopf et al. 2000) and XMM-Newton (Jansen et al. 2001)
X-ray observatories are capable of resolving narrow line fea-
tures, this possibility is impeded by typically long delays before
the GRB observations begin by which time the X-ray afterglow
has dimmed signiﬁcantly. Previously claimed X-ray absorption
and emission features in pre-Swift GRB afterglow spectra (Piro
et al. 1999; Yoshida et al. 1999; Antonelli et al. 2000; Piro et al.
2000; Yoshida et al. 2001; Reeves et al. 2003; Butler et al. 2003;
Watson et al. 2003) have been largely put in doubt (Sako et al.
2005).

The interstellar gas absorbs X-rays largely independent of
temperature as long as this gas is not fully ionised. Therefore
the cold neutral, warm ionised and hot ionised phases of the
ISM are equally opaque to soft X-rays. The equivalent hydro-
gen column density (NHX) inferred from absorption in soft X-ray
spectra is greater than the host neutral hydrogen column den-
sity (NHI) in a high percentage of GRBs (Watson et al. 2007;
Campana et al. 2010) with the diﬀerence at times exceeding a
factor of ten. The NHX for GRBs with known redshift is mea-
sured by ﬁtting the broad soft X-ray absorption with a neutral
absorber, and then converting the best-ﬁt metal column density
to an equivalent neutral hydrogen column density assuming so-
lar abundances. GRBs preferentially occur in subsolar metallic-
ity environments (Le Floc’h et al. 2003; Modjaz et al. 2008;
Savaglio et al. 2009; Graham & Fruchter 2013) and if this is con-
sidered, NHX would increase further. The soft X-ray absorption
traces the total metal content along the GRB line of sight rather
than the hydrogen content and thus one should compare neutral
metal column densities with the total metal column densities to
estimate the excess X-ray absorption. Schady et al. (2011) com-
pared GRB host column densities of singly and highly ionised
species with the soft X-ray absorbing metal column densities
rather than the neutral hydrogen column densities and concluded
that these species were insuﬃcient to account for the excess soft
X-ray absorption. Instead they postulated that a signiﬁcant com-
ponent of ultra-highly ionised gas that is transparent to UV pho-
tons could be responsible for the excess absorption.

Other investigations into this problem have concentrated on
sources of absorption that are both intrinsic and external to the
GRB host galaxy. Campana et al. (2010, 2012) and more re-
cently Starling et al. (2013), analysed a large sample of Swift
GRBs with known redshift, and found that NHX increased with
redshift, implying that the soft X-ray absorption excess has an
external origin. Behar et al. (2011) found that the opacity of
GRBs beyond z = 2 remains constant, and suggested that a low
redshift neutral and diﬀuse intergalactic medium (IGM) with
metallicity of 0.2-0.4Z(cid:12) could be the X-ray primary absorber
for GRBs at high redshift (z (cid:38) 2.0). Similarly, Starling et al.
(2013) conclude that a warm-hot IGM (WHIM) with tempera-
tures between 105−6 K and metalicity > 0.2Z(cid:12) could explain the
excess absorption for GRBs at z (cid:38) 3. However, recent results

from surveys of intergalactic O vi absorbers at low redshift with
HST show that the median metalicity (of IGM gas) at T ∼ 105.5
K is 0.1Z(cid:12) (Savage et al. 2014). On the basis of cosmological
simulations Campana et al. (2015) show that metals in the cir-
cumgalactic medium (T ∼ 106−7 K; 0.2 − 0.4Z(cid:12)) expelled by
galactic winds from dense groups of small galaxies at low red-
shift can account for soft X-ray absorption in GRBs at z (cid:38) 3.
For GRBs at z < 2, the contribution to the soft X-ray absorption
from components external to the GRB host galaxy are expected
to be NHX < 1022 cm−2. On the other hand, Watson & Jakob-
sson (2012) have previously argued that selection eﬀects may
produce the NHX − z correlation, and when low redshift, dust
obscured GRBs with high NHX (> 1022 cm−2) are included in
the GRB samples, the signiﬁcance of this correlation is greatly
reduced, thereby suggesting that the IGM plays a lesser role in
causing excess soft X-ray absorption.

Absorption by sources internal to the GRB host have been
suggested owing to the fact that NHX is larger for bursts with
higher NHI
(Krühler et al. 2011, 2012b; Campana et al. 2012;
Watson et al. 2013). On the basis of both a positive correlation
between NHX and line of sight host dust extinction (AV), and
also between NHX and NHI, Watson et al. (2013) attribute the
soft X-ray absorption to dense H ii regions of the GRB host.
Since singly ionised helium produces a soft X-ray absorption
proﬁle similar to neutral hydrogen without absorbing UV pho-
tons, Watson et al. (2013) suggest that He ii in low metallicity,
dense H ii regions (103−4 cm−3) within 5 pc of the GRB is the
dominant source of the absorption. Higher column densities of
He would increase the X-ray opacity within the H ii region by
almost an order of magnitude. Krongold & Prochaska (2013) ,
who studied the time-dependant photoionisation of the circum-
burst environment by the afterglow, found that a soft X-ray ex-
cess (cid:38) 10 can be explained if the progenitor is embedded in a
dense molecular cloud with a density that is ∼ 10 − 100 times
higher than the ISM, and is partially ionised out to 5 − 30 pc. In
their simulations, solar metallicities within the dense absorbing
material were required to produce an order of magnitude diﬀer-
ence in X-ray and UV absorbing column densities. However, the
largest problem that these models face is in explaining how such
a highly ionised dense medium could remain in pressure equi-
librium with the cold and dense neutral phase ISM.

Given the continual lack of a clear explanation for the soft
X-ray absorption excess, in this paper we explore the eﬀect of
hot gas within the GRB host ISM may have on our X-ray af-
terglow observations. Since GRBs are associated with massive
stars and SNe, the ISM of such galaxies is likely to be turbulent
(e.g. Ostriker & Shetty 2011; Walch et al. 2011; de Avillez &
Breitschwerdt 2012), with large volume ﬁlling factors of hot and
ultra-highly ionised gas, as has been observed in a number of
GRB hosts (Fox et al. 2008). We aim to understand the imprint
that such an ISM would have on the GRB afterglow spectra, with
a particular focus on how the ultra-highly ionised species traced
by, C v, N vi and O vii aﬀect the afterglow absorption.

To do this, we consider data cubes obtained from simulations
of a multiphase and turbulent ISM driven by SNe with gas that
is in collisional ionisation equilibrium (CIE). We pass random
lines of sight through the data cubes and keep track of the ab-
sorbing column of all C, N, and O ions along each line of sight.
The paper is organised as follows: In section 2 we discuss the ex-
pected turbulence in the ISM within GRB host galaxies, provide
details of the ISM data cubes that we used, and describe our line-
of-sight code used to determine the hydrogen and metal column
densities. In section 3 we describe how we estimate the X-ray
excess absorption from the measured column densities and com-

2. Methodology
2.1. Turbulent ISM: A property of low mass star-forming

galaxies

Turbulence within the ISM is driven by massive stellar feedback
(e.g. Ostriker & Shetty 2011; Kim et al. 2013). GRB hosts have
high SFR (e.g. Savaglio et al. 2009), are associated with SN ex-
plosions and are thus likely to have a turbulent ISM.
Host galaxies of GRBs have a typical mass of ∼109M(cid:12) and
like most low mass (< 1010M(cid:12)) star-forming galaxies (SFGs)
are often seen to be irregular and clumpy (Fruchter et al. 2006).
These consist of star-forming clumps and lack a central bulge
(e.g. Elmegreen & Elmegreen 2005; Förster Schreiber et al.
2011). The kinematics inferred from H-α line emission suggest
that SFGs are rotating disks or are dominated by random motion
(e.g. Förster Schreiber et al. 2006; Newman et al. 2013). The
H-α emission-line studies and resolved maps of such galaxies
show their ISM to be turbulent with large outﬂows (e.g. New-
man et al. 2012). Milvang-Jensen et al. (2012) ﬁnd that GRB
hosts are Lyman−α emitters with equivalent widths larger than
bright Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Fox et al. (2008) report all
seven GRBs in their sample to be absorbed by high velocity (few
100 km/s), highly ionised gas within the host galaxy, and Thöne
et al. (2007) report absorption by high velocity, low ionised gas
clouds possibly from the halo of the host galaxy, all of which are
indicative of star formation driven outﬂows.

Massive star winds and SN explosions inject energy into the
ISM causing it to heat up and expand. These regions of hot gas
form SN bubbles extending out to kpc scales (de Avillez & Bre-
itschwerdt 2004; Krause et al. 2013) have a low particle den-
sity and exist in dynamic equilibrium with high density and low
temperature neutral gas creating a multiphase ISM. We consider
simulations of an ISM that employ these properties.

2.2. Interstellar medium data cubes
Details of the three-dimensional ISM data cubes that we used are
given in Gatto et al. (2015). In summary, the size of the box is
256 pc3 with a resolution of 2 pc. The two data cubes we used for
this work had an initial hydrogen density of 1 cm−3 and 3 cm−3,
and we label them as datacube1 and datacube3 for the rest of
the paper. Simulations with initial temperature of 5000 K were
driven artiﬁcially for 25 Myr prior to the onset of the SN explo-
sions. Thereafter, turbulence in these boxes is driven by type II
SN explosions, where the SNe are placed at random peaks at all
times for datacube1, and at density peaks for 50% of the time
and at random positions for the other 50% for datacube3. SN ex-
plosions at peak position correspond to SNe that explode within
their natal region, while the SN explosions at random positions
correspond to SN explosions from runaway stars. In the latter
case, the SN explosion is more likely to occur in the ISM phase
with largest volume ﬁlling factor and thus low density gas. The
higher the density of the ambient medium of a SN, the more of
the energy injected by the SN that is radiated away, and the lower
the energy transfered to the ISM. Thus ISM with peak SN explo-
sions causes a low fraction of hot gas within the ISM, and Gatto
et al. (2015) conclude that these simulations do not produce a
realistic ISM. However, they further demonstrate that as the den-
sity of the ISM data cube increases to ≥ 3 cm−3, purely random
SN explosions cause the ISM data cubes to be completely ﬁlled

with hot gas due to a lack of radiative cooling and lack of gas
outﬂows because of the strict periodic boundary conditions em-
ployed for the simulations. We thus restrict our analysis to the
data cube with density 1 cm−3 with SNe placed at random posi-
tions, and the data cube with density 3 cm−3 with SN explosions
distributed equally between peak and random positions.
The SN rates for simulations with densities 1 cm−3 and 3
cm−3 are set at 3 Myr−1 and 14 Myr−1, respectively. The SN rate
is chosen to be proportional to the star formation rate (SFR),
where the latter is assumed to follow the Kennicutt-Schmidt re-
lation (Kennicutt 1998). Using a Chabrier initial mass function
(IMF) (Chabrier 2003) and star formation eﬃciency of 1% this
corresponds to one SN per 102 M(cid:12) of stellar mass formed with
a predeﬁned thermal energy of 1051 erg. The simulations with
densities 1 cm−3 and 3 cm−3 were run for 130 Myr and 198 Myr,
respectively. We use two simulations with diﬀerent gas densi-
ties to see if a relation between the ISM type and X-ray ab-
sorbing gas exists. The densities of carbon, atomic hydrogen,
and molecular hydrogen are given as inputs. Solar abundance
ratios are assumed for both the simulations. Although GRBs
are typically found to reside within subsolar metallicity galax-
ies (Le Floc’h et al. 2003; Modjaz et al. 2008; Savaglio et al.
2009; Graham & Fruchter 2013), for metallicities in the range
1.0Z(cid:12) > Z > 10−3Z(cid:12), the dynamics of the simulated ISM are a
weak function of metallicity (Walch et al. 2011). While super-
solar GRB hosts have been reported (Levesque et al. 2010;
Savaglio et al. 2012; Krühler et al. 2012a; Graham & Fruchter
2013; Elliott et al. 2013), no GRB hosts with Z < 10−3Z(cid:12) have
been observed. The lowest metallicity thus far known for a GRB
host galaxy is Z ∼ 0.01Z(cid:12) (GRB050730; Starling et al. 2005,
GRB090926A; Rau et al. 2010. D’Elia et al. 2010), and the aver-
age host metallicity is ∼ 0.5Z(cid:12) (Prochaska et al. 2007; Savaglio
2012). We therefore expect the ﬁlling factor of warm and hot gas
in our data cube to be a fair representation of the multiphase ISM
within GRB host galaxies.

The formation and cooling of ions (H i, H ii and C ii) and
molecules (H2, CO) are calculated as the simulations using al-
gorithms from Glover et al. (2010) and Glover & Clark (2012),
and the cooling rate for highly ionised oxygen, for example O vi,
is incorporated in accordance with CIE (Gnat & Ferland 2012).
Thus, our treatment of the gas under the conditions of CIE is
consistent with the simulations. The gas within the injection ra-
dius is heated to 106 − 107 K when the SN explodes, and the
speed of the blast expanding within the SN bubble corresponds
to the speed of sound within the local region. The superbubbles
then expand adiabatically and cool correspondingly. They are,
however reheated time after time with subsequent explosions.

The simulations do not take the ionisation of dense regions
by UV emission from massive stars into account, and only trace
the collisionally ionised gas, which is only relevant above 104 K.
Thus all gas below 104 K is approximated to be neutral. Under
conditions of CIE, C v, N vi, and O vii form at T > 105 K and
peak at T ∼ 105.5 K (Sutherland & Dopita 1993). Large column
densities of highly ionised gas can therefore only be produced
in our simulations if the fraction of volume covered by these
hot-diﬀuse regions is high. In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 we plot the par-
ticle number density against temperature in the left panel, and
the volume-weighted probability density functions (PDFs) for
temperature and density, in the middle and right panels, respec-
tively, for datacube1 and datacube3. The general widths of the
temperature and density distributions is similar to that of previ-
ous studies (e.g. de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2004) .The middle
and right panels of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show that the hot-diﬀuse
regions within the ISM data cubes do indeed cover a high vol-

ume fraction. Fig. 2 also shows the presence of a higher volume
fraction of hot and low density gas in datacube3 compared to dat-
acube1, and a higher volume fraction of cooler gas which leads
to the formation of higher densities of molecular hydrogen.

2.3. Line of sight sampling

Rays of random orientation are passed through 100 random po-
sitions within the ISM data cubes with typical path lengths ∼
350 pc. We ensure that our sightlines sample large length scales
(few 100 pc). In tracking the cells within the data cube that are
crossed by our ray, only those cells where the ray crosses > 1/10
of the resolution of the cell (i.e. 0.2 pc) are considered, and we
verify that no cell is selected twice. The temperature of the gas
and number density of hydrogen is extracted for each selected
cell, and the C, N, and O number density within each cell is cal-
culated assuming solar abundances from Asplund et al. (2009).
To calculate the ion fractions for C, N, and O, we use the CIE
tables from Sutherland & Dopita (1993), which are appropriate
for solar metallicities and are consistent with the assumptions
that went into the data cube simulations. The distance traversed

Article number, page 4 of 9

by the ray within each cell is calculated by keeping track of the
entry and exit point for the cell, and the total distance traversed
by the ray is then the sum of the distances traversed through all
selected cells. The column densities of H, C, N, and O ions along
the line of sight is the summation of their respective column den-
sities in each cell. It is important to calculate the distance trav-
elled within each cell to measure the column densities accurately
as neither the density within the data cube nor the distances trav-
elled within each cell are uniform.

Amongst C, N, and O, the ionisation potentials for O i and
H i are most similar (13.598 eV and 13.618 eV), and thus we
consider O i as a tracer of neutral gas and oxygen ion species
from O i to O viii as tracers of the X-ray absorbing gas, which
we refer to as NOX. The absorption excess along each sightline
is estimated as the ratio of the X-ray absorbing oxygen column
density, NOX, to neutral oxygen column density, NOI.

and datacube3, respectively. For both the simulations, the col-
umn densities of ultra-highly ionised species C v, N vi and O vii
are found to be similar to the neutral and singly ionised com-
ponents within the H ii regions (gas T > 104 K). However, the
column densities of C i, N i, and O i increase further once the
neutral ions within denser regions (gas T < 104 K) are consid-
ered. The column densities of C v, N vi, and O vii are generally
seen to be the highest after C i, N i, O i and C ii, N ii, and O ii,
respectively. The denser data cube shows a rise in the ionisation
proﬁle at ionisation levels higher than C v, N vi, and O vii owing
to the higher volume fraction of hotter ≥ 107 K gas in the ISM.

densities from other singly ionised metals, such as Si ii, S ii or
Fe ii, due to the uncertainty in the dust depletion (e.g. Savaglio

of the GRBs in our sample have a soft X-ray absorption excess
> 10.0 and 20% have an absorption excess < 4.0.

NOI

All GRBs within our sample have a soft X-ray absorption
excess > 2.0 and thus warrant an additional absorbing compo-
nent in addition to the neutral ISM. For the 25% of the GRBs
with high excess > 10.0, the turbulent ISM with density 3 cm−3
could provide a natural explanation but the neutral and total oxy-
gen column densities for such sightlines is 2-3 orders magnitude
lower than those observed in GRB afterglow spectra (Schady
et al. 2011). A high percentage of sightlines through our data
cube show excess < 2.0, 86% and 63% for datacube1 and dat-
acube3, respectively; these require an additional component to
a turbulent ISM to produce the higher X-ray absorption excess.
We ﬁnd that the fraction of sightlines with signiﬁcant absorption

In Table 1 we compare C iv, N v, O vi, and Si iv column den-
sities within our data cubes with those measured within a small
sample of GRB host galaxies by Prochaska et al. (2008) and Fox
et al. (2008). To accomplish this, we track the Si ions in addi-
tion to the C, N, and O ions already traced. Si ions with two or
more missing electrons are predominantly collisionally ionised,
and thus in these cases our derived column densities are reliable.
The ionisation potential of Si i is lower than H i, and thus we
cannot accurately track the Si i and Si ii ion fractions and column
densities within the data cubes. Fox et al. (2008) reported both
high velocity (few 1000 km/s) and low velocity (few 100 km/s)
absorption components, and in Table 1 we report only the col-
umn densities of the low velocity absorption components, which
are more likely to originate from the GRB host ISM. The veloc-
ity of the gas within the cells of our data cube is typically 10 -
100 km/s and is always below 500 km/s. We ﬁnd that the mea-
sured column densities of C iv, N v, O vi, and Si iv are typically
an order of magnitude larger than those traced along our 100
sightlines. For a typical GRB line of sight that crosses through a
path length of 350 pc, the density of the GRB host ISM required
to explain the column densities of C iv, N v, O vi, and Si iv ions
should be an order of magnitude higher than the density of the
ISM data cubes. Or else, the column densities can be produced
by GRB host ISM with a density that is a factor of 2-3 higher
than the ISM data cube and a path length of ∼ kpc. The later is
the likely scenario given the small size of the GRB hosts (∼ 5
kpc) (Fruchter et al. 2006).

The turbulent ISM with density 3 cm−3 have properties that
match the observed properties such as C iv, N v, O vi, and Si iv
column densities, and NCIV
ion fractions. Sight-

lines passed through the ISM data cube with density 3 cm−3
can produce the large soft X-ray absorption excess ( NOX

NOI
seen in GRB afterglow spectra. However, the total oxygen col-
umn densities for such sightlines is typically 1016 cm−2 and 2-3
orders of magnitude lower in comparison to those observed in
GRB afterglow. While an ISM with higher density and larger
length scale would increase NOX it is unlikely that these will pro-
duce the column densities observed in GRB spectra. Also, a large
fraction of sightlines do not show signiﬁcant absorption excess
and this is in stark contrast to the observations. In the following
section we explore additional consequences such an absorbing
medium has on the observations proﬁles that either enhance or
challenge the proposed scenarios and discuss alternative sources
of X-ray absorption that could be responsible for the excess X-
ray absorption.

tral metal column densities encounter a higher H2 fraction. The
observed H i column densities are larger than those measured
along our sightlines through both data cubes. As noted earlier,
this is due to the larger length scales probed by the GRB after-
glow and/or higher density of the GRB host ISM. We scale the
path of the typical path length of our sightlines to increase H i
column densities for the sightlines within our data cubes to form
an overlap between the detections from the GRB afterglow spec-
tra and those are indicated with blue open triangles and red open
circles for datacube1 and datacube3, respectively. For each data
cube, the projected H i column densities are obtained by multi-
plying by a scale factor, which is given by the ratio of average
NHI for three GRBs with 0.01 < f (H2) < 0.1 to the NHI within
our sightlines at average f (H2) for the three GRBs. The scaled
path lengths for datacube1 is ∼26 kpc and for datacube3 is ∼17
kpc, assuming typical path length of 350 pc for our sightlines.

Molecular hydrogen can absorb soft X-rays and the eﬀec-
tive absorption excess can be estimated as [2.85NH2
+ NHI]/NHI,
where the cross-section of H2 is 2.85σH (Wilms et al. 2000).
In order for H2 to produce a soft X-ray absorption excess of >
2.0 , the H2 fraction would then need to be > 0.5 . For all GRBs
with detected H2 absorption, the molecular hydrogen fraction
is less than 0.1, and this corresponds to a soft X-ray absorp-
tion excess of less than 1.2 . Furthermore, for a sample of six
GRBs with good quality optical afterglow spectra, Tumlinson
et al. (2007) place an average upper limit of 10−6.5 on f (H2).
On the basis of simulations, Whalen et al. (2008) show that
the molecular hydrogen within the GRB vicinity would be de-
stroyed by UV radiation from massive stars prior to the onset
of GRB. They highlight the possibility, however, that absorp-
tion from molecular clouds from less active star-forming regions
within the GRB host that are unrelated to the GRB progenitor
region may be detected occasionally in the GRB afterglow spec-
tra. So far, such examples of intervening molecular clouds have
not been the cause for the X-ray absorption excess. For example,
GRB 120327A (D’Elia et al. 2014), GRB 120815A (Krühler
et al. 2013), and GRB 121014A (Friis et al. 2015) with ﬁrm
detections of f (H2) and three of the GRBs in Tumlinson et al.
(2007) (GRB 050820,GRB 071031, and GRB 080413) that have
stringent upper limits on f (H2), are part of our sample and they
have signiﬁcant X-ray absorption excess (NOX/NOI > 4.0).

Although, our analysis suggests that a large H2 fraction
( fH2 > 0.5) would result in an observed X-ray excess, the exces-
sive attenuation from gas and dust along such sightlines would
typically prevent the GRB afterglows from being detected. Such
sightlines could be observed in large GRB hosts with a dense
ISM and with early-time sensitive spectra. These shall also lead
to detection of high hydrogen fractions ( f (H2) > 0.1), which
have been missed in observations so far
(Noterdaeme et al.
2015).

4.1. Could molecular hydrogen account for some of the

excess?

Since GRB host galaxies are star-forming galaxies, and given the
positive relation between molecular hydrogen and star forma-
tion (i.e. Kennicutt-Schmidt law; Kennicutt 1998; Bigiel et al.
2008), we would expect there to be an abundance of molecular
gas within GRB host galaxies. We therefore consider whether
molecular hydrogen could cause a notable amount of additional
X-ray absorption.

Our ISM data cubes include molecular gas and thus al-
low us to estimate the molecular hydrogen fraction, f (H2) =

(cid:3), along the traced line of sights. In Fig. 7 we

solid circles for datacube1 and datacube3, respectively, for ﬁve
GRBs1 (green squares) with detected H2 absorption in their af-
terglow spectra and six GRBs (black points) with upper limits
on column densities of H2 within the host ISM. As expected, for
both ISM data cubes, we ﬁnd that the sightlines with larger neu-

Interstellar dust is unlikely to be the cause of the X-ray ex-
cess. The relation between AV and NHX along GRB lines of sight
has been studied extensively. The seminal works of Galama &
Wijers (2001) and Stratta et al. (2004) were the ﬁrst to point
out the very high gas-to-dust ratio, NHX
, in comparison to the
AV
Milky Way. Studies with larger samples that include heavily
dust-extinguished GRBs verify this claim and have provided ev-
idence of a positive correlation between NHX and AV (Schady
et al. 2007; Starling et al. 2007; Schady et al. 2010; Greiner et al.
2011; Zafar et al. 2011, 2012; Watson et al. 2013; Covino et al.
2013). The most heavily dust extinguished GRBs are found in
the most massive GRB hosts with high NHX and NHI
(Krühler
et al. 2011; Perley et al. 2013), and although NHX and AV ap-
pear to be correlated, the rate of increase in NHX does not trace
the increase in AV, with NHX
decreasing with an increase in AV
AV
(Krühler et al. 2011). GRB 080607, a roughly solar metallicity
GRB, is a good example, having had one of the dustiest sight-
lines yet detected (AV ∼ 3.3; Perley et al. 2011), and yet a simi-
lar NHX and NHI. Furthermore, most of the GRBs in the sample
of Schady et al. (2011) were relatively unextinguished by dust.
Thus, dust within the GRB host ISM cannot be the source of the
soft X-ray absorption excess.

4.2. Additional sources of soft X-ray absorption excess in

GRBs

As already stated in section 1, the alternate sources of X-ray ab-
sorption, such as as a dense circumburst medium (Krongold &
Prochaska 2013), or hot IGM (Behar et al. 2011; Starling et al.
2013) face challenges. Krongold & Prochaska (2013) require
the circumburst medium to be dense (> 100 cm−3), pre-ionised
and to extend to a few 10 pc, and how such dense hot regions
of gas could exist in pressure equilibrium with the neutral phase
ISM is not clear. From the density vs temperature plots for mul-
tiphase ISM, left panel in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, we do not ﬁnd gas
clouds with density > 10 cm−3 and temperature > 104 K in a
multiphase ISM. Similar conditions might however be present
in young massive star clusters (e.g. Krause et al. 2012; Palouš
et al. 2013) and these scenarios need to be pursued further.

Highly ionised gas, unaccounted for in our simulations,
could also arise as a result of photoionisation from massive stars
and delayed recombination. Photoionisation by hot stars is un-
suitable to produce the high ionisation stages of oxygen (O vi and
O vii),which we are primarily interested in. Soft X-ray emission
(0.2 - 2 keV) from SN-remnants, superbubbles, and non-thermal
sources (e.g. Sasaki et al. 2002; Haberl et al. 2012; Krause et al.
2014) scales with the star formation rate and would total to a
luminosity of 1040 erg s−1 for a typical GRB host, insuﬃcient
to produce signiﬁcant columns of hot gas. Non-equilibrium ion-
isation (NEI) may change the detailed ionisation structure com-
pared to the collisional ionisation assumption made here (de
Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2012). NEI can cause ions like C v,
N vi, and O vi to be produced between 103.8 ≤ T ≤ 105.5 K un-
like CIE conditions, where these ions can only be produced at T
> 105 K. However, the soft X-ray absorption excess is measured
as the ratio of total oxygen column density to the neutral oxygen
column density and, thus, is insensitive to the detailed ionisa-
tion structure. We ﬁnd neutral oxygen in denser regions for a
collisionally ionised ISM, where collisions are frequent and de-
layed recombination does not have a large impact. Therefore,
while the detailed NEI stage abundances would be interesting to
have in this context, they would not lead to very diﬀerent values

for NOX and NOI. Therefore, we believe the conclusions of our
analysis are robust.

Some source of hot gas, in addition to the turbulent ISM, is
required to explain the observed X-ray absorption excess, and
in particular, the paucity of GRBs in our sample with low soft
X-ray absorption excess, NOX
< 2.0. Absorption by collisionally
NOI
ionised ISM eases the constraints on absorption by the circum-
burst medium and the WHIM.

5. Summary and future work
We estimate the soft X-ray absorption excess for a sample of
16 GRBs as the fraction of total oxygen column density to neu-
tral oxygen column density, NOX
, and we ﬁnd that signiﬁcant soft
NOI
X-ray absorption excesses, NOX
> 2.0, occurs in every case. Fur-
NOI
thermore, half of the GRBs in our sample show NOX
> 10. It
NOI
is important to quantify the soft X-ray absorption for GRBs to
estimate and explain the total X-ray absorbing column densi-
ties that produce this excess. In our simulations of collisionally
ionised ISM, typical of star-forming galaxies such as GRB hosts,
we ﬁnd values of excess compatible with observations only for
a small number of sightlines. In these cases, however, NOX is
orders of magnitude below the observed values, which are typi-
cally of the order of 1018.5 cm−2. We therefore ﬁnd that the ISM
in GRB host galaxies cannot be the main contributor to the X-ray
absorbing column for GRB afterglows. Alternate scenarios, pos-
sibly involving absorption from the circumburst medium and the
WHIM, will have to be invoked to explain soft X-ray absorption
excess along all the sightlines.
To obtain the observed H i column densities, the path length
of the sightlines through datacube1 is required to be ∼26 kpc
and the path length of the sightlines through datacube3 is re-
quired to be ∼17 kpc. GRB hosts typically are smaller in size,
<10 kpc (Fruchter et al. 2006), and thus their ISM are required
to be denser by a factor of 2 or 3 over 3 cm−3 to explain the
observed H i column densities. ISM data cubes with density 10
cm−3 have a higher SN rate (77 Myr−1) and thus a more turbu-
lent ISM. We observe that increase in density of the ISM data
cubes results in higher volume fraction of hot gas and, thus, an
ISM with density 10 cm−3 could have a lower fraction of sight-
lines with NOX
< 2.0. It seems, however, unlikely, extrapolating
NOI
from the two simulations we have analysed, that the total oxygen
column would increase enough to match observations.

On the basis of the ISM data cubes in our analysis, we pre-
dict the presence of ultra-highly ionised gas traced by C v, N vi,
and, O vii. In Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of
the Blazar outburst, K-α absorption lines from elements such as
N vi and O vii produced by the WHIM have been detected, corre-
sponding to column densities of ∼1015 − 1016 cm−2, albeit with
low statistical signiﬁcance (e.g. Nicastro et al. 2005; Kaastra
et al. 2006). The GRB afterglow soft X-ray, 0.3 − 10 keV, inte-
grated ﬂux at beginning of the Swift XRT observations is ∼10−10
erg/cm2/s. This ﬂux typically decays to ∼10−12 erg/cm2/s after
about six hours and to ∼10−13 erg/cm2/s about 24 hours after the
GRB trigger. The next generation of X-ray observatories such
as Astro-H (Takahashi et al. 2012) and the Athena X-ray Ob-
servatory (Nandra et al. 2013) will be able to detect absorption
features from ultra-highly ionised gas within the WHIM to high
signiﬁcance even approximately 10 hours after the GRB trig-
ger. Such a detection with GRBs serving as beacons would be
possible in ∼100 ks with Astro-H (Tashiro et al. 2014) and in
∼50 ks with X-ray IFU (Nicastro et al. 2014) on board Athena

M. Tanga et al.: Soft X-ray absorption excess in gamma-ray burst afterglow spectra:

(Barret et al. 2013). The regions of hot gas within the GRB
host ISM are expected to be denser and localised within sub-
kpc scales in comparison to the diﬀuse WHIM; the absorption
signature due to the ultra-highly ionised gas within the ISM and
circumburst medium should be easily detected within the expo-
sure times required to detect the WHIM. Thus, apart from probes
of the WHIM, GRBs shall serve as unique probes of the hot gas
in star-forming galaxies that are ionised by massive stars.
