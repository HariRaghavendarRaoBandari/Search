Abstract

By any measure, semisimple modules form one of the most important classes of mod-
ules and play a distinguished role in the module theory and its applications. One
of the most fundamental results in this area is the Wedderburn-Artin theorem. In
this paper, we establish natural generalizations of semisimple modules and give a
generalization of the Wedderburn-Artin theorem. We study modules in which every
submodule is isomorphic to a direct summand and name them virtually semisimple
modules. A module RM is called completely virtually semisimple if each submodules
of M is a virtually semisimple module. A ring R is then called left (completely) vir-
tually semisimple if RR is a left (compleatly) virtually semisimple R-module. Among
other things, we give several characterizations of left (completely) virtually semisimple
rings. For instance, it is shown that a ring R is left completely virtually semisimple if
and only if R ∼= Qk
i=1 Mni(Di) where k, n1, ..., nk ∈ N and each Di is a principal left
ideal domain. Moreover, the integers k, n1, ..., nk and the principal left ideal domains
D1, ..., Dk are uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by R. Finally we completely
describe the structure of ﬁnitely generated completely virtually semisimple modules
over commutative rings.

Introduction

In the study of k-algebras A (associative or non-associative) over a commutative ring k, the
semisimplicity plays an important role. It is known that for a k-module M , any A-module
structure corresponds to a k-algebra homomorphism θ : A → Endk(M ) with θ(a) = the
multiplication map by a ∈ A and ker θ = AnnA(M ). Furthermore, if M is an A-module
with S = EndA(M ), then the image of θ lies in EndS(M ). This shows that if either k is a
division ring and A is a simple algebra or A has a simple faithful module, then A can be
represented by linear transformations and in the ﬁnite dimension case, A is a subalgebra
of an n-by-n matrix algebra over a division ring. The concept of semisimple module is
often introduced as a direct sum of simple ones. E. Cartan characterized semisimple Lie
algebras and shown that every ﬁnite-dimensional module over a semisimple Lie algebra
with zero characteristic is a semisimple module (see for example [16, Page 27]). Finite
dimensional algebras are serious examples of Artinian algebras (algebras with descending
chain conditions on their left (right) ideals). They are considered as Artinian rings in the
ring theory. Artinian rings with a faithful semisimple module are known to be semisimple
rings that form a fundamental and important class of rings. If R is any ring, an R-module
M is said to be simple in case M 6= (0) and it has no non-trivial submodules. Semisimple
R-modules are then considered as direct sums of simple R-modules. It is well known that
R is a semisimple ring if and only if the left (right) R-module R is semisimple if and only
if all left (right) R-modules are semisimple. As the historical perspective, the fundamental
characterization of ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebras was originally done by Wedderburn in his
1907 paper ([21]). After that in 1927, E. Artin generalizes the Wedderburn’s theorem for
semisimple algebras ([2]).
In fact, the Wedderburn-Artin’s result is a landmark in the
theory of noncommutative rings. We recall this theorem as follows:
Wedderburn-Artin Theorem: A ring R is semisimple if and only if R ∼= Qk
i=1 Mni(Di)
where k, n1, . . . , nk ∈ N and each Di is a division ring. Moreover, the integers k, n1, . . . , nk
and the division rings D1, . . . , Dk are uniquely determined (up to a permutation).

By the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem, the study of semisimple rings can be reduced to
the study of modules over division rings. We note that a semisimple module is a type
of module that can be understood easily from its parts. More precisely, a module M is
semisimple if and only if every submodule of M is a direct summand. In this paper, we
study modules (resp., rings) in which every submodule (resp., left ideal) is isomorphic
to a direct summand. We will show that the study of such rings can be reduced to the
study of modules over principal left ideal domains. This gives a generalization of the
Wedderburn-Artin Theorem.

Throughout this paper, all rings are associative with identity and all modules are

2

unitary. Following [9], we denote by K.dim(M ) the Krull dimension of a module M .
If α > 0 is an ordinal number then the module M is said to be α-critical provided
K.dim(M ) = α while K.dim(M/N ) < α for all non-zero submodules N of M . A module
is called critical if it is α-critical for some ordinal α > 0.

Deﬁnitions 1.1. We say that an R-module M is virtually semisimple if each submodule
of M is isomorphic to a direct summand of M . If each submodule of M is a virtually
semisimple module, we call M completely virtually semisimple. If RR is (resp., RR) is a
virtually semisimple module, we then say that R is a left (resp., right) virtually semisimple
ring. A left (resp., right) completely virtually simple ring is similarly deﬁned.

In Section 2, we introduce the fundamental tools of this study and give some basic
properties of virtually semisimple modules. Among of other things, we show for a non-zero
virtually semisimple module RM the following statements are equivalent: (1) RM is ﬁnitely
generated; (2) RM is Noetherian; (3) u.dim(RM ) < +∞, and (4) M ∼= R/P1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ R/Pn
where n ∈ N, each Pi is a quasi prime left ideal of R such that R/Pi is a critical Noetherian
R-module (here, u.dim(RM ) is the uniform dimension of the module RM and we say that a
left ideal P of a ring R is quasi prime if P 6= R and, for ideals A, B ⊆ R, AB ⊆ P ⊆ A ∩ B
implies that A ⊆ P or B ⊆ P ) (see Proposition 2.7). Also, it is shown that a ﬁnitely
generated quasi projective 1-epi-retractable R-module M is virtually semisimple if and
only if EndR(M ) is a semiprime principal left ideal ring (Theorem 2.9). An R-module M
is called (resp., n-epi-retractable) epi-retractable if for every (resp., n-generated) submodule
N of M there exists an epimorphism f : M −→ N . This concept is studied in [6].

Section 3 is devoted to study of the structure of left (completely) virtually semisimple
rings. We give several characterizations of left virtually semisimple rings in Theorem 3.4.
We shall give some examples to show that the (completely) virtually semisimple are not
symmetric properties for a ring, and also completely virtually semisimple modules properly
lies between the class of semisimple modules and the class of virtually semisimple modules;
see Examples 3.7∼3.10. While the left virtually semisimple is not a Morita invariant
ring property, we proved that the left completely virtually semisimple is (see Proposition
3.3). In Theorem 3.13, we will give the following generalization of the Wedderburn-Artin
theorem:

A Generalization of the Wedderburn-Artin Theorem: A ring R is left completely
virtually semisimple if and only if R ∼= Qk
i=1 Mni(Di) where k, n1, ..., nk ∈ N and each Di
is a principal left ideal domain. Moreover, the integers k, n1, ..., nk and the principal left
ideal domains D1, ..., Dk are uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by R.

Finally, in Section 4, we investigate the structure of ﬁnitely generated (completely)
virtually semisimple modules over a commutative ring. If R is a commutative ring and M

3

is a nonzero ﬁnitely generated R-module, then it is proved that:
(1) If M is virtually semisimple, then M ∼= Ln

i=1 R/Pi where for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, R/Pi is

a principal ideal domain.

(2) M is completely virtually semisimple if and only if M ∼= Ln

i=1 R/Pi where each R/Pi
is a principal ideal domain (1 ≤ i ≤ n) and for each i 6= j either Pi + Pj = R, or
Pi ⊆ Pj or Pj ⊆ Pi (see Theorem 4.4 and Theorem 4.6, respectively).

Any unexplained terminology and all the basic results on rings and modules that are

used in the sequel can be found in [1] and [13].

2 Virtually semisimple modules

The subject of our study in this section is some basic properties of virtually semisimple
modules. We introduce the fundamental tools of this study for latter uses.

A module RM is said to be Dedekind ﬁnite if M = M ⊕ N for some R-module N , then
N = 0. Let M and P be R-modules. We recall that P is M -projective if every diagram in
R-Mod with exact row

P

M

/ N

/ 0

can be extended commutatively by a morphism P −→ M . Also, if P is P -projective, then
P is called quasi projective. A direct summand K of M is denoted by K ≤⊕

RM .

Proposition 2.1. The following statements hold.

(i) Let RM be a non-zero virtually semisimple module. If M = M1 ⊕M2 is a decomposition

for RM such that HomR(M1, M2) = 0 then M2 is a virtually semisimple R-module.

(ii) If I is an ideal of R with IM = 0. Then M is a virtually semisimple (R/I)-module if

and only if RM is virtually semisimple.

(iii) A module RM is virtually semisimple quasi projective if and only if it is an epi-

retractable R-module and all of its submodules are M -projective.

(iv) Being (completely) virtually semisimple module is a Morita invariant property.
(v) Let RM be virtually semisimple and W ≤ RM . If W contains any submodule K of
M with K is embedded in W , then RW is virtually semisimple and there is a direct
summand K of RM such that K ∼= W and K ⊕ K ′ = W for some submodule K ′. In
particular, if RW is Dedekind ﬁnite, then W ≤⊕ M .

Proof. (i) Let K ≤ M2. Since RM is a virtually semisimple module, there is a decom-

position N ⊕ N ′ = M with N ∼= K. It easily seen that M1 is fully invariant submodule
It follows that M1 = (N ∩ M1) ⊕ (N ′ ∩ M1) and
of M because HomR(M1, M2) = 0.
hence N ∩ M1 = 0 because HomR(M1, N ) = 0. Thus M1 ⊆ N ′ which implies that
N ′ = M1 ⊕ (N ′ ∩ M2). Now we have M = N ⊕ M1 ⊕ (N ′ ∩ M2) = M1 ⊕ M2. It follows
that N and hence K is isomorphic to a direct summand of M2, as desired.
(ii) This is routine.
(iii) The necessity is clear by the deﬁnition and [22, Proposition 18.2]. Conversely, assume
that RM is epi-retractable and every submodule of M is M -projective. If N ≤ M , then
there is a surjective homomorphism f : M −→ N . Since now N is M -projective, Kerf
must be a direct summand of M , the proof is complete.
(iv) It is shown that Morita equivalences preserve monomorphisms and direct sums (see
for instance [1, §21]).
(v) If W ≤ RM as stated in the above, then by our assumption, W ∼= K where K ≤⊕
RM
and K ⊆ W . It follows that K is also a direct summand of W . Similarly, if N ≤ W and
V ⊕ V ′ = M with V ∼= N , we can deduce that N is isomorphic to a direct summand of
W , that is RW is virtually semisimple. The last statement is now clear.

Let R1 and R2 be rings and T = R1 ⊕ R2. It is well-known that any T -module M has
the form M1⊕M2, for some Ri-modules Mi(i=1, 2). In fact, M = e1M ⊕e2M where e1 and
e2 are central orthogonal idempotents in T such that e1R2 = e2R2 = 0 and e1 + e2 = 1T .
Clearly eiM is naturally an Ri-module (as well as T -module) for i=1, 2. This shows that
HomT(Mi, Mj) = 0 for i 6= j. Thus by Proposition 2.1, we have the following result:

Corollary 2.2. Let Ri (1 6 i 6 n) be rings, T = Qn
i=1 Ri and M = M1 ⊕ ... ⊕ Mn be a
T -module where each Mi is an Ri-module. Then RiMi is (completely) virtually semisimple
if and only if T M is (completely) virtually semisimple.

A non-zero submodule N of M is called essential submodule if N has non-zero intersec-
tion with every non-zero submodule of M and denoted by N ≤e M . Each left R-module
M has a singular submodule consisting of elements whose annihilators are essential left
ideals in R.
In set notation it is usually denoted as Z(M ) and M is called a singular
(resp., non-singular) module if Z(M ) = M (resp., Z(M ) = 0). Also, direct sum of simple
submodules of RM is denoted by Soc(RM ). Direct sum of pairwise isomorphic submodules
is called homogenous components. The following result shows that the study of virtually
semisimple modules M with Dedekind ﬁnite Z(M ) reduces to the study of such modules
when they are either singular or non-singular.

Proposition 2.3. Let R be a ring and M be an R-module. Then:

5

(i) If M is virtually semisimple such that Z(M ) is Dedekind ﬁnite. Then M ∼= W ⊕ L
where W is a singular virtually semisimple R-module and L is a non-singular virtually
semisimple R-module.

(ii) If every homogenous components of Soc(M ) is ﬁnitely generated. Then M is virtually
semisimple if and only if M ∼= W ⊕ L where W is a semisimple R-module and L is a
virtually semisimple R-module with Soc(L) = 0.

Proof. (i) This is obtained by parts (i) and (v) of Proposition 2.1.
(ii) By hypothesis, Soc(M ) is Dedekind ﬁnite and hence, M = Soc(M ) ⊕ L when RM is
virtually semisimple. Conversely, assume that M = W ⊕ L where RW is semisimple and
RL is virtually semisimple with Soc(L) = 0. Note that W = Soc(M ) and let N ≤ RM .
Then there exists a submodule W ′ of M such that Soc(N ) ⊕ W ′ = W . Since Soc(N ) ≤
N ≤ W ⊕ L, so N = Soc(N ) ⊕ T where T is a submodule of M . Since Soc(M ) = W ,
so Soc(T ) = 0 and hence T is embedded in L. Now, since L is virtually semisimple, so
T is isomorphic to a direct summand of L. It follows that N is isomorphic to a direct
summand of M . Thus M is a virtually semisimple R-module.

The following example shows that the hypothesis of “Z(M ) is Dedekind ﬁnite” in Part
(i), and “every homogenous components of Soc(M ) is ﬁnitely generated” in Part (ii) of
Proposition 2.3 can not be relaxed.

Example 2.4. For R = Z4 and M = Z4 ⊕ (L∞
i=1 Z2), we have Z(RM ) = Soc(RM ) is not
a direct summand of RM . Since R is a commutative Artinian principle ideal ring, every
R-modules is a direct sums of cyclic modules (see [3, Result 1.3]). We note that since M
is countable, all submodules of M are also countable. It follows that every submodule of
M is isomorphic to Z4 ⊕ (Lj∈J Z2) or Lj∈J Z2 where J is an index set with |J| ≤ ℵ, i.e.,
M is a virtually semisimple R-module.

A module is called a uniform module if the intersection of any two non-zero submodules
is non-zero. The Goldie dimension of a module M , denoted by u.dim(M ), is deﬁned to
be n if there exists a ﬁnite set of uniform submodules Ui of M such that Ln
i=1 Ui is an
essential submodule of M . If no such ﬁnite set of submodules exists, then u.dim(M ) is
deﬁned to be inﬁnity (in the literature, the Goldie dimension of M is also called the rank,
the Goldie rank, the uniform dimension of M ).

Next we need the following two lemmas.

Lemma 2.5. (See [9, Lemmas 15.3 and 15.8]) If RM is a Noetherian module, then
K.dim(M ) is deﬁned. If RM is a non-zero module with Krull dimension, then RM has a
critical submodule.

6

Lemma 2.6. (See [14, Lemma 6.2.5]) If RM is ﬁnitely generated, then K.dim(M ) 6
K.dim(RR).

In the following proposition, we investigate some ﬁniteness conditions of virtually

semisimple modules.

Proposition 2.7. For a non-zero virtually semisimple module M , the following conditions
are equivalent.

(1) M is ﬁnitely generated.
(2) M is Noetherian.
(3) u.dim(M ) < +∞.
(4) M ∼= R/P1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ R/Pn where n ∈ N and each Pi is a quasi prime left ideal of R such

that R/Pi is a critical Noetherian R-modules.

In any of the above cases, M ∼= N for all N ≤e M .

Proof. (4) ⇒ (1) and (1) ⇒ (2) are by the facts that direct summands and ﬁnite direct
sums of ﬁnitely generated module are again ﬁnitely generated.
(2) ⇒ (3) is well-known for any module (see for instance [9, Corollary 5.18]).
(3) ⇒ (4). Assume that u.dim(M ) is ﬁnite and we set u.dim(M ) = n where n ∈ N. Then
there exist uniform cyclic independent submodules U1,. . . ,Un of M such that U1⊕...⊕Un :=
N ≤e RM . Since M is virtually semisimple, so N ∼= K where K ⊕ K ′ = M for some
K ′ ≤ M . Since u.dim(K) = u.dim(M ), so u.dim(K ′) = 0 (see [9, Corollary 5.21]). Thus
M ∼= N , which implies that RM is ﬁnitely generated, hence RM is Noetherian, as we see
in the proof of (1) ⇒ (2). Now by Lemma 2.5, every non-zero submodule of M contains
a non-zero cyclic critical R-submodule. Thus the condition (3) and our assumption imply
that M is isomorphic to V1 ⊕. . .⊕Vn where each Vi is a critical Noetherian R-module. Now
assume that V ∼= R/P is a α-critical left R-module and AB ⊆ P ⊆ A∩B for some ideals A,
B of R. If A * P and B * P , then K.dim(R/A) < α and K.dim(R/B) < α. On the other
hand, B/P is a ﬁnitely generated left (R/A)-module and hence by 2.6, K.dim(B/P ) 6
K.dim(R/A) < α. This contradicts K.dim(R/P ) = max{K.dim(R/B), K.dim(B/P )}.
Therefor P is quasi prime. The proof is complete.

It is easily to see that if N ∼= M for all N ≤e RM , then RM is virtually semisimple.
The Proposition 2.7 shows that a ﬁnitely generated module RM is virtually semisimple if
and only if N ∼= M for all N ≤e RM . Thus in this case, RM is essentially compressible
in the sense of [18] (i.e., M ֒→ N for all N ≤e RM ). Essentially compressible modules
are weakly compressible in the sense of [23] (i.e., N HomR(M, N ) 6= 0 for any submodule
0 6= N ≤ RM ). We state below some results related to these concepts and then apply them

7

to investigating the endomorphism ring of a virtually semisimple module. First we need
the following proposition from several articles. We recall that a ring R is left hereditary
if and only if every left ideal is projective.

Proposition 2.8. The following statements hold.

(i) Any essential compressible module is weakly compressible.
(ii) If RM is a non-zero quasi projective 1-epi-retractable, then EndR(M ) is a principal
left ideal ring if and only if RM is epi-retractable. In particular, RR(n) is epi-retractable
if and only if Mn(R) is a principal left ideal ring.

(iii) If RM is a quasi projective retractable, then EndR(M ) is a semiprime ring if and only

if RM is weakly compressible.

(iv) Every semiprime principal left ideal ring is a left hereditary ring.

Proof. The part (i) is by Theorems 3.1, 2.2 of [18]. (ii) is obtained by [6, Theorem 2.2].
The part (iii) is [10, Theorem 2.6] and (iv) is Lemma 4 of [4].

Let R be a ring and M be a left R-module. If X is an element or a subset of M , we
deﬁne the annihilator of X in R by AnnR(X) = {r ∈ R | rX = (0)}. In the case R is
non-commutative and X is an element or a subset of an R, we deﬁne the left annihilator
of X in R by l.AnnR(X) = {r ∈ R | rX = (0)} and the right annihilator of X in R by
r.AnnR(X) = {r ∈ R | Xr = (0)}.

Theorem 2.9. Let M be a quasi projective ﬁnitely generated 1-epi-retractable R-module.
Then M is virtually semisimple if and only if End(RM ) is a semiprime principal left ideal
ring.

Proof. Set S := End(RM ) and then we apply Proposition 2.8.
(⇒). By Proposition 2.8(ii), S is a principal left ideal ring. To show that S is also
semiprime, we note that since RM is virtually semisimple, it is essentially compressible.
Thus by Proposition 2.8(i), RM is weakly compressible and so by Proposition 2.8(iii), S
is a semiprime ring.
(⇐). Assume that S is a semiprime principal left ideal ring. To show that RM is virtually
semisimple, let N ≤ RM . Again by Proposition 2.8(ii), RM is epi-retractable and hence
there exists a surjective R-homomorphism f : M −→ N . By ﬁrst isomorphism theorem,
it is enough to show that Ker(f ) ≤⊕
RM . Note that HomR(M, Ker(f )) = l.AnnS(f ).
Assume that ϕ : S −→ Sf with ϕ(g) = gf . Since now S(Sf ) is projective by Proposition
2.8(iv), so the l.AnnS(f ) = Ker(ϕ) is a direct summand of S and hence l.AnnS(f ) = Se
for some e2 = e ∈ S. Clearly, Im(e) ⊆ Ker(f ) and so by the epi-retractable condition,
there exists a surjective homomorphism h : M −→ Ker(f ). So Ker(f ) = Im(h) for some

8

h ∈ S. Thus h ∈ HomR(M, Ker(f )) = Se, which implies that h(1 − e) = 0. It follows that
h = he and hence Ker(f ) = Im(he) ⊆ Im(e). This shows that Im(e) = Ker(f ). It is easily
see that Im(e) is a direct summand of M and the proof is complete.

3 Structure of left virtually semisimple rings

In this section, we investigate the structure of (completely) left virtually semisimple rings
and give a generalization of Wedderburn-Artin theorem. Meanwhile, we give an example
to show that the left/right distinction cannot be removed and also we provide an example
of left virtually semisimple ring which is not completely. We shall ﬁrst note that every
(right) left virtually semisimple is principal (right) left ideal ring. Moreover, we have the
following result duo to A. Goldie.

Lemma 3.1. (See [8, Theorem A and B]) A semiprime principal left ideal ring is ﬁnite
direct product of matrix rings over let Noetherian domains.

The following lemma is also needed.

Lemma 3.2. [6, Proposition 2.5] Let R be a left hereditary ring. Then every left free
R-module is epi-retractable if and only if R is a principal left ideal ring.

We investigate below the class of left (completely) virtually semisimple rings. We

should point out that every set can be well-ordered (see for instance [11]).

Proposition 3.3. The following statements hold.
(i) A ring R is left (completely) virtually semisimple if and only if every (projective) free

left R-module is (completely) left virtually semisimple.

(ii) Let R be a ring Morita equivalent to a ring S. Then R is a left completely virtually

semisimple if and only if S is so.

(iii) The class of left virtually semisimple (resp,. left completely virtually semisimple) rings

is closed under ﬁnite direct products.

(iv) Let R be a left completely virtually semisimple ring. Then for any semisimple R-
module N and projective R-module P with Soc(RP ) = 0, N ⊕P is a completely virtually
semisimple R-module.

Proof. (i) One direction is clear.
In view of Lemma 3.2 and Proposition 2.1(iii), we
shall prove the left completely virtually semisimple case. Let F = Lα∈Ω Reα be a free
R-module with basis {eα}α∈Ω and P ≤ RF . As the proof of Kaplansky’s theorem [12,
Theorem 2.24], we ﬁx a well-ordering “ < ” on the indexing set Ω. For any α ∈ Ω, let Fα

9

(resp., Gα) be the span of the eβ’s with β 6 α (resp., β < α). Then each a ∈ P ∩ Fα has
a unique decomposition a = b + reα with b ∈ Gα and r ∈ R. The mapping ϕα : a 7→ r
maps P ∩ Fα onto a left ideal Uα with kernel P ∩ Gα. By Proposition 2.1(iii), R is left
hereditary and so RUα is projective. Thus ϕα splits, so we have

P ∩ Fα = (P ∩ Gα) ⊕ Aα

for some submodule Aα of P ∩Fα isomorphic to Uα. It can be checked that P = Lα∈Ω Aα.
Hence P ∼= Lα∈Ω Uα where Uα = ϕα(P ∩ Fα).
It follows that if Q ≤ RP , then Q ∼=
Lα∈Ω Vα where Vα ⊆ Uα. Since R is left completely virtually semisimple, so RUα is
virtually semisimple for any α ∈ Ω. Hence Vα is isomorphic to a direct summand of Uα
(α ∈ Ω). This shows that RP is virtually semisimple. The proof is complete.
(ii) It follows by (i) (since virtually semisimplity and projectivity conditions are Morita
invariants).
(iii) is by Corollary 2.2.
(iv) Assume that K ≤ N ⊕ P . We shall show that K is a virtually semisimple R-module.
Since Soc(RP ) = 0, we have Soc(R(N ⊕ P )) = N and hence Soc(RK) is a direct summand
of K. Thus there is a submodule K ′ such that K = Soc(RK) ⊕ K ′. Clearly, K ′ ∩ N = 0
and so K ′ can be embedded in RP . Now assume that W ≤ K. By a similar argument, we
have W = Soc(RW ) ⊕ W ′ where W ′ embeds in K ′. By part (i), K ′ is virtually semisimple
R-module. Therefore, W ′ is isomorphic to a direct summand of K ′, proving that K is a
virtually semisimple R-module.

Several characterizations of left virtually semisimple rings are given below.

Theorem 3.4. The following statements are equivalent for a ring R.
(1) R is a left virtually semisimple ring.
(2) R is a semiprime principal left ideal ring.
(3) R is a left hereditary and principal left ideal ring.
(4) R ∼= Qk

i=1 Mni(Di) where each Di is a (Noetherian) domain and every Mni(Di) is a

principal left ideal ring.

Proof. (1) ⇒ (2). Assume that R is a left virtually semisimple ring. Then it is clear that
R is a principal left ideal ring. We will to show R is semiprime. Assume that I 2 = 0 where
I is an ideal of R and L := r.AnnR(I). Then I ⊆ L and for each 0 6= s ∈ R, since I(Is) =
I 2s = 0, we conclude that either s ∈ L or Is ⊆ L. This shows that L is an essential left
ϕ
∼=R L by Proposition 2.7. We have ϕ(I) = ϕ(IR) = Iϕ(R) = IL = 0.
ideal of R. Thus RR
Thus I = 0 because ϕ is a monomorphism. Therefore, R is a semiprime principal left ideal
ring.

(2) ⇒ (3) is by Proposition 2.8(iv).
(3) ⇒ (1). Since R is a principal left ideal ring, so RR is epi-retractable. Thus by
Proposition 2.1(iii), R is a left virtually semisimple ring.
(2) ⇒ (4) is by Lemma 3.1.
(4) ⇒ (2) is by the fact that the class of semiprime principal left ideal rings is closed under
ﬁnite direct products.

Remark 3.5. The integers k and n1, . . . , nk in the Theorem 3.4 are uniquely determined
by R because of thefollowing lemma.

Lemma 3.6. Let {Di}k
i=1 Mni(Di) ∼= Qr
that Qk

Proof. Let R = Qi Mki(Di). Thus R is a semiprime left Noetherian. Let Q = Q(R)
be the classical left quotient ring of R. By our assumption, we can conclude Q =
Qi Mni(Qi) ∼= Qj Mkj (Q′
j are division rings. Hence the result is ob-
tained by Wedderburn-Artin Theorem [13, Theorem 3.5].

In view of the above characterization 3.4(iv) of a left virtually semisimple ring, the
following natural question arises: “Are the domains in Theorem 3.4(iv) unique up to iso-
morphism?”. The following example shows that the answer is negative in general.

Example 3.7. Let D = A1(F ), the ﬁrst Weyl algebra over a ﬁeld F with characteristic
zero. It is known that D is a simple Noetherian domain (see for instance [14, Chapter
1, §3, Theorem 1.3.5]). If I is a non-zero left ideal of A1(F ) then by [20, Theorem 3(i)],
I ⊕ I ∼= D ⊕ D and so M2(D) ∼= M2(EndD(I)). While by [17, Proposition 1], D is not
isomorphic to the ring EndD(I).

In the sequel, we show that the answer of the above question is positive when R is a left
completely virtually semisimple ring. In this case, R is determined by a set of matrix rings
over principal left ideal domains and the size of matrix rings. Firstly, we give an example
to show that there exists a left virtually semisimple ring which is not a left completely
virtually semisimple ring.

Example 3.8. Let R = A1(F ), the ﬁrst Weyl algebra over a ﬁeld F with characteristic
zero, and let S = M2(R). By [14, Example 7.11.8], R is not a (left) principal ideal domain
and hence S can not be a left completely virtually semisimple by Proposition 3.3(ii) while
S is a semiprime principal ideal ring (virtually semisimple ring) by ([14, Chapter 7, §11,
Corollary 7.11.7]).

11

The following example shows that for a ring the (completely) virtually semisimple

property is not symmetric.

Example 3.9. In [5, Section 4], it is given an example of principal right ideal domain R
which is not left hereditary. Thus by Theorem 3.4, we deduce that R is right (completely)
virtually semisimple which is not left virtually semisimple.

The following provide an example of a simple ring R such that R is a left and a right

(completely) virtually semisimple ring, but it is not semisimple.

Example 3.10. Let A be a ﬁeld and ϕ : A −→ A a ring automorphism such that ϕn 6= 1
If R = A[x, x−1, ϕ], then by [19, Proposition 4.7], R is a
for every natural number n.
simple principal left and right ideal domain that is not a division ring. But it is clear that
R is a left and right (completely) virtually semisimple ring.

A ring R is said to be Mn-unique if, for any ring S, Mn(R) ∼= Mn(S) implies that
R ∼= S (see for instance [12, §17.C]). Let C be a class of R-modules. Following [12, §17C],
we say that C satisﬁes weak n-cancellation if, for any P , Q in C, the condition P (n) ∼= Q(n)
implies that EndR(P ) ∼= EndR(Q). An R-module P is said to be a generator for R-Mod
if R is a direct summand Lλ∈Λ P for some ﬁnite index set Λ.

We need the following lemmas.

Lemma 3.11. (See [12, Theorem 17.29]) For any ring S, and any given integer n ≥ 1,
the following two statements are equivalent.
(1) Any ring T Morita-equivalent to S is Mn-unique.
(2) The class of ﬁnitely generated projective generators in S-Mod satisﬁes the weak n-

cancelation property.

Lemma 3.12. (Kaplansky’s Theorem [12, Theorem 2.24]). Let R be a left hereditary
ring. Then every submodule P of a free left R-module F is isomorphic to a direct sum of
left ideals of R.

We are now in a position to prove the following generalization of the Wedderburn-Artin

theorem.

Theorem 3.13. Let R be a ring. Then R is a left completely virtually semisimple ring if
and only if R ∼= Qk
i=1 Mni(Di) where k, n1, ..., nk ∈ N and each Di is a principal left ideal
domain. Moreover, the integers k, n1, ..., nk and the principal left ideal domains D1, ..., Dk
are uniquely determined (up to isomorphism) by R.

12

Proof. (⇒). Assume that R is a left completely virtually semisimple ring. Then by
Theorem 3.4(iv), R ∼= Qk
i=1 Mni(Di) where each Di is a domain and every Mni(Di) is a
principal left ideal ring. Since R is a left complectly virtually semisimple ring, so Mni(Di)
is a left completely virtually semisimple ring for each i (1 6 i 6 k). By Proposition 3.3(ii),
each Di is left completely virtually semisimple, i.e., each Di is a principal left ideal domain.
Hence in view of Lemma 3.11 and Theorem 3.4, in order to prove that each Di is uniquely
determined, it is enough to checked that any principal left ideal domain D satisﬁes the
condition(ii) of Lemma 3.11.

Suppose that P and Q are ﬁnitely generated generators in D-Mod and P (n) ∼= Q(n)
for n > 1. By Lemma 3.12, every projective D-module is free. Thus P ∼= D(r) and
Q ∼= D(s) for suitable integer numbers r, s ≥ 1. Therefore, D(nr) ∼= D(ns) and since D
is left Noetherian, so by the invariant basis number property on D (see for instance [12,
Page 17]), we conclude that r = s and hence DP ∼= DQ.
(⇐). Clearly every principal left ideal domains is completely virtually semisimple. Thus
the implication is obtained by Proposition 2.1.

4 Finitely generated virtually semisimple modules over com-

mutative rings

The purpose of this section is to prove a structure theorem forﬁnitely generated completely
virtually semisimple modules over a commutative ring. We ﬁrst state the following lemma.

Lemma 4.1. (See [15, Corollary 4.9 (ii)]). If R is a commutative domain such that Mn(R)
is a principal left ideal ring for some integer number n ≥ 1, then R is a principal ideal
domain.

Now we have the following proposition.

Proposition 4.2. Let R be a commutative ring.

(i) If P1, P2 are two prime ideals of R, then P1 * P2 if and only if HomR(R/P1, R/P2) = 0.
(ii) Let P1, . . . , Pn be n prime ideals of R and M = Ln
i=1 R/Pi such that each R/Pi is
α-critical. If RM is virtually semisimple, then for each i, R/Pi is a principal ideal
domain.

Proof. (i) (⇒). Suppose, contrary to claim, that 0 6= f ∈ HomR(R/P1, R/P2). Thus
0 6= f (1 + P1) is a non-zero element in R/P2. Hence P1 ⊆ AnnR(f (1 + P1)) = P2.
(i) (⇐) is clear.

13

(ii) We can write RM ∼= (R/P1)(n1) ⊕ ... ⊕ (R/Pt)(nt) where Pi 6= Pj for each i 6= j and
Pt
i=1 ni = n. If 0 6= HomR(R/Pi, R/Pj ) for i 6= j, then by part (i), Pi ⊂ Pj. Since now 0 6=
Pj/Pi ≤ R/Pi and R/Pi is α-critical, so K.dim(R/Pj) = K.dim((R/Pi)/(Pj /Pi)) < α, a
contradiction. Therefore HomR(R/Pi, R/Pj ) = 0 for i 6= j and by Proposition 2.1(i), each
(R/Pi)(ni) is a virtually semisimple R-module as well as (R/Pi)-module. By Proposition
2.8, Mni(R/Pi) is a principal left (right) ideal ring. Thus R/Pi is a principal ideal domain
by Lemma 4.1 and so the proof is complete.

The following lemma is surely in the literature and the proof is routine, but we have

been unable to locate it.

Lemma 4.3. Let X and Y be critical R-modules such that K.dim(X) < K.dim(Y ). If
f ∈ HomR(X, Y ), then Kerf = 0 or Imf = 0.

We are now in a position to prove our ﬁrst main result of this section.

Theorem 4.4. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated module over a commutative ring R. If RM is
virtually semisimple, then RM ∼= Ln
i=1 R/Pi where each R/Pi is a principal ideal domain
for all i.

Proof. Since RM is ﬁnitely generated virtually semisimple and R is commutative, by
Proposition 2.7(iv), M ∼= R/P1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ R/Pn where n ≥ 1, each Pi is a prime ideal and
each R/Pi is a critical Noetherian R-module. Thus each R/Pi is α-critical for some ordinal
α. Thus there exist ordinal numbers α1 < . . . < αk such that M ∼= Wα1 ⊕ . . . ⊕ Wαk where
for each j, Wαj = Li∈Λαj

R/Pi with Λαj = {i | 1 6 i 6 n and R/Pi is αj−critical}.

Now by Lemma 4.3, HomR(Wαj , Wαk ) = 0 for each 1 ≤ j ≤ k−1 and so by Proposition
2.1(i), Wαk is virtually semisimple. Hence by Proposition 4.2(ii), each R/Pi is a principal
ideal domain in which i ∈ Λαk . We set

Γ = {i ∈

k−1
[
j=1

Λαj | there exists r ∈ Λαk s.t. Pr ⊆ Pi},

and Γ′ =

k−1
[
j=1

Λαj \ Γ.

Then we conclude that M ∼= (Li∈Γ′ R/Pi) ⊕ (Li∈Γ R/Pi) ⊕ Wαk . Now for each i ∈ Γ,
there exists an r ∈ Λαk with Pr ⊆ Pi. It follows that is a homomorphic image of R/Pr.
Thus R/Pi is a principal ideal domain.

Again by Proposition 4.2(i), we have

HomR(Wαk , (M
i∈Γ′

R/Pi)) = 0 and HomR((M
i∈Γ

R/Pi), (M
i∈Γ′

R/Pi)) = 0.

14

Therefore, by Proposition 2.1(i), Li∈Γ′ R/Pi is virtually semisimple. Now we can repeat
the above argument on the module N := Li∈Γ′ R/Pi and continue inductively until there
is no possibility of expansion any more. Thus we obtain R/Pi is a principal ideal domain,
for each i ∈ Γ′ and hence the proof is complete.

The following example shows that the converse of Theorem 4.4 is not true in general.

Example 4.5. Let F be a ﬁeld and we set R = F [[x, y]]/hxyi.
It is clear that M =
RX ⊕ RY is a maximal ideal of R where X = x + hxyi and Y = y + hxyi. It is eas-
ily see that Spec(R) = {RX, RY, M}. Consider M as an R-module and hence M ∼=
R/AnnR(X) L R/AnnR(Y ) = R/RY L R/RX. By [7, Theorem 2.1], the rings R/RX
and R/RY are principal ideal domains because they have only one prime ideal M/RX and
M/RY , they are principal, respectively. We show that RM is not virtually semisimple.
Note that X 2 = X(X +Y ) and Y 2 = Y (X +Y ) and so we have RX 2 ⊕RY 2 ≤ R(X +Y ) ≤
RM. It follows that u.dim(RM) = u.dim(R(X + Y )) or equivalently R(X + Y ) ≤e RM.
Thus if RM is virtually semisimple we must have R ∼= R(X + Y ) ∼= M, but M is not
cyclic, a contradiction.

We conclude the paper with the following theorem, which determines the structure

ﬁnitely generated completely virtually semisimple modules over a commutative ring.

Theorem 4.6. Let M be a ﬁnitely generated module over a commutative ring R. Then M
is completely virtually semisimple if and only if M ∼= Ln
i=1 R/Pi where R/Pi is a principal
ideal domain for all i and for each pair i, j either Pi, Pj are comparable or Pi + Pj = R.

Proof. (⇒). By Theorem 4.4, M ∼= Ln
i=1 R/Pi where R/Pi is a principal ideal domain
for each i. Assume that Pi * Pj, Pj * Pi for some i 6= j. Since M is a completely virtually
semisimple R-module, we have R/Pi ⊕ R/Pj := W is a virtually semisimple R-module as
well as R/(Pi ∩ Pj)-module. Hence, replacing R with R/(Pi ∩ Pj), we may assume that
Pi ∩ Pj = 0. Thus R ∼= R(1 + Pi, 1 + Pj) := N can be embedded in the R-module W . If
now N ∩ R/Pi = 0 then N embeds in R/Pj and so Pj must be zero. This contradicts our
assumption. Therefor N ∩ R/Pi 6= 0 and similarly N ∩ R/Pj 6= 0. It follows that N ≤e W .
Since W is a virtually semisimple R-module, we have R ∼= W by Proposition 2.7. This
shows that R/Pi is a projective R-module. Thus the following short exact sequence

0

/ Pi 

/ R

/ R/Pi

/ 0

splits which implies that Pi = Re for some e2 = e ∈ R. Since e(1 − e) = 0 ∈ Pj, we have
1 − e ∈ Pj because Pj is a prime ideal of R and Pi * Pj. In sequence, 1 ∈ Pi + Pj and
hence Pi + Pj = R.

(⇐). Assume that M ∼= Ln
i=1 R/Pi where R/Pi is a principal ideal domain for all i and for
each pair i, j either Pi, Pj are comparable or Pi + Pj = R. Let T = P1 ∩ · · ·∩ Pn. If Pi ⊆ Pj
for some i, j then we can remove Pj from the latter intersection. Thus after reducing the
intersection, we may assume that T = Pα1 ∩ . . . ∩ Pαt where Pαi + Pαj = R for each i 6= j.
By Chinese Reminder theorem, we have R/T ∼= R/Pα1 × . . . × R/Pαt . It is clear that
M is a virtually semisimple R/T -module. Since each R/Pj is a principal ideal domain,
we have R/T is a completely virtually semisimple ring by Proposition 3.3(iii). Now for
any Pj, either Soc(R/Pi) = 0 or Pi is a maximal ideal of R. Thus M = Soc(M ) ⊕ Q
where Q ∼= Lk
j=1 R/Pj such that Pj ∈ {Pα1 , . . . , Pαt } for each j. On the other hand, each
R/Pj is isomorphic to a direct summand of R/T . This shows that Q is a projective R/T -
module. Since Soc(Q) = 0, by Proposition 3.3(iv), M is a completely virtually semisimple
R/T -module as well as R-module.
