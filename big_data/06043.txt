1. Introduction and Main Results

Given a sequence of real numbers {sk}k∈N0 a necessary and suﬃcient condi-

tion that there exists a non-decreasing function σ on R such that

sk =Z ∞

−∞

xkdσ(x)

for all k ∈ N0

is that the quadratic forms

n

Xi,j=0

xixjsi+j ≥ 0 ∀n ∈ N0, x0, . . . , xn ∈ R.

This is equivalent to the Hankel matrices

Hn := (si+j)n

i,j=0

being positive semideﬁnite for all n ∈ N0.

The sequences with representation (1) are called (Hamburger) moment se-

quences or positive sequences. The function σ is called a moment solution of

the sequence. Positive sequences consist of two mutually disjoint sequences. A
sequence is called positive deﬁnite if the Hankel matrix Hn is positive deﬁnite
for all n ∈ N0; otherwise it is called positive semideﬁnite. It is worthwhile to
point out that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between deﬁnite and semideﬁnite

character of moment sequences in their integral representations [3, 13].

Two nondecreasing functions are not considered to be distinct if their diﬀer-

ence is a constant at all the points of continuity of the diﬀerence. A Hamburger

moment sequence with no more than one distinct nondecreasing function σ in

(1) is called determinate, and indeterminate otherwise. Berg, Chen and Ismail
[5] proved that a moment sequence is determinate if and only if λn → 0 for
n → 0, where λn is the smallest eigenvalue of Hn. Moreover, for the indeter-
minate case a positive lower bound for the smallest eigenvalue of the Hankel

matrices was explicitly found.

A partial sequence is a sequence in which some terms are speciﬁed, while the

remaining terms are unspeciﬁed and may be treated as free real variables. A

partial positive (semi)deﬁnite sequence is a partial sequence if each of the fully
speciﬁed principal submatrices of its Hankel matrix Hn is positive (semi)deﬁnite
for all n ∈ N0. Since every principal submatrix of a positive deﬁnite matrix is
positive deﬁnite, it is trivial that a partial sequence has a positive completion

only if it is a partial positive sequence. A Hamburger moment completion (or

a positive completion) of a partial sequence is a speciﬁc choice of values for the

unspeciﬁed terms resulting in a positive (semi)deﬁnite sequence. Note that a

partial positive deﬁnite sequence can have either a positive deﬁnite completion or

a positive semideﬁnite completion, and possibly both. The Hamburger moment

completion problem asks whether a given partial sequence has a Hamburger

moment completion. A pattern of a partial sequence is the set of positions of

the speciﬁed entries. Denote the pattern of a partial sequence by the set of

positive integers

P = {k ∈ N0 : sk is speciﬁed}.

2

We say that a pattern P is positive (semi)deﬁnite completable if every partial

positive (semi)deﬁnite sequence with pattern P has a positive (semi)deﬁnite

completion.

There are two main methods for dealing with partial moment sequences:

(i) Perturbation or modiﬁcation, and (ii) Completions. Perturbation or mod-

iﬁcation investigates the stability of positivity of a moment sequence to per-

turbations by arbitrary sequences, thus informing about the range of possible

values allowable for the missing entries. Completion is based on reconstruction

from fully speciﬁed subsequences of a partial sequence while retaining positiv-

ity. Perturbation of a moment sequence is closely related to the orthogonal

polynomials the moment sequence generates. Gautschi [8] studies sensitivity of

orthogonal polynomials to perturbations. Readers are advised to refer to [2]

and [9] for examples of modiﬁed moments. Choi and Jafari [7] give solutions to

the Hamburger moment completion problem. In this paper, a comprehensive

study of completable partial positive sequences and their patterns is given and

perturbations of moment sequences by arbitrary sequences is studied.

In Section 2 of this paper, a series of results are given that characterize the

moment subsequences of Hamburger moment sequences and give a description of

completable patterns from partial sequences. Some of the results and examples

on subsequences have appeared in the monograph of Berg, Christensen and

Ressel [4] and the extensive paper of Stochel and Szafraniec [12] and elsewhere.

While not new, alternative elementary proofs are presented here to set the stage

to discuss the subsequence problem and compeletable patterns. In Section 3,

a relationship between moment and submoment sequences is derived and the

determinacy of the two problems are compared. Finally, in Section 4, stability

of the moment problem with respect to perturbation by an arbitrary sequence

is discussed and a criterion for such perturbations is given.

2. Moment subsequences and completions

Let {sk}k∈N0 be a moment sequence. If its subsequence {˜sk}k∈N0 is also a

moment sequence, it is called a submoment sequence.

Example 2.1. Consider the sequence {sk}k∈N0 given by

sk =

1

k + 1

.

(3)

Since the Hankel matrices Hn are positive deﬁnite for all n ∈ N0, the sequence
is a Hamburger moment sequence. Indeed, each of the Hankel matrices Hn is
a Hilbert matrix, which is totally positive (all of its minors are positive). Thus

there exists a non-decreasing function σ on R such that

1

k + 1

=Z ∞

−∞

xkdσ(x)

for all k ∈ N0.

(4)

Let ǫ > 0 and choose m ∈ N0 such that s2m < ǫ. Suppose that only the term s2m
is missing and the remaining terms are speciﬁed. Setting s2m = 0 the Hankel
matrix Hm is not positive semideﬁnite. Thus, arbitrarily small perturbations
of a positive sequence ejects one from the cone of positive sequences. We will

return to perturbation of positive sequences in Section 4.

For positive semideﬁnite completable patterns, arithmetic progression pat-

terns play a crucial role. In [7] Choi and Jafari show that arithmetic progression

patterns guarantee there exists completions.

Theorem 2.2. If the pattern P = dN0 + ℓ0 for some d ∈ N and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0, then
P is positive semideﬁnite completable.

The following corollary shows that if ℓ0 = 0, then the partial positive pattern

P is actually positive deﬁnite completable.

Corollary 2.3. If the pattern P = dN0 for some d ∈ N0, then P is positive
deﬁnite completable.

However, if the pattern P = dN + ℓ0 for d ∈ N and ℓ0 ∈ 2N, then the pattern

P is not positive deﬁnite completable.

Example 2.4. The subsequence {˜sk}k∈N0 of the sequence {sk}k∈N0 in Example
2.1 given by

˜sk =

1

(k + 1)!

(5)

is not a positive sequence since the determinant of its second Hankel matrix is

< 0

and hence has no solution to its moment problem. This example shows that an

arbitrary subsequence of a positive sequence is not necessarily positive. Thus

we need to look for ideas to appropriately remove terms of the sequence while

preserving positivity.

Theorem 2.5. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a positive sequence. The subsequence {˜sk}k∈N0
given by ˜sk = sk+ℓk is positive if ℓk = kd + ℓ0 for all d ∈ N0 and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0.

Proof. By Hamburger’s theorem, since {sk}k∈N0 is a positive sequence, there
exists a non-decreasing function σ on R that has {sk}k∈N0 as its moment se-
quence. Suppose ℓk = kd + ℓ0 where d ∈ N0, and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0. Then for all real
numbers x0, x1, x2,··· , xm, we have

The above shows that any subsequence of a positive sequence is positive if

they are extracted in a certain periodic manner.

Since the speciﬁed subsequence {1/(k + 1)}∞
a non-decreasing function ˜σ on R such that

k=0 is positive deﬁnite, there exists

1

k + 1

=Z ∞

−∞

xkd˜σ(x)

for all k ∈ N0.

By Corollary 2.3 the sequence (6) has a positive deﬁnite completion. That is,

there exists a non-decreasing function σ on R such that

1

k + 1

=Z ∞

−∞

x2kdσ(x)

for all k ∈ N0.

The primary goal in this paper is to investigate connections between solutions

of a moment sequence and solutions of its submoment sequences.

As was seen in an above example, an arbitrary subsequence of a positive

sequence is not necessarily positive. We will develop some methods to extract

positive subsequences from a positive sequence.

Theorem 2.7. Let {fk}k∈N0 be a sequence of functions on R such that

fi(x)fj (x) = fi+j(x).

Let σ be a non-decreasing function on R such that

sk :=Z ∞

−∞

fk(x)dσ(x) < ∞ for all k ∈ N0.

(7)

(8)

Then the sequence {sk}k∈N0 is positive. Furthermore, condition (7) holds if and
only if

fk(x) = (f1(x))k

for all k ∈ N0.

(9)

Proof. For any ﬁnite set of real numbers x0, x1,··· , xm, we have

fi+j(x)dσ(x)

Clearly (9) holds for k = 0 and k = 1. Assume fn(x) = (f1(x))n holds. Then
fn+1(x) = fn(x)f1(x) = (f1(x))nf1(x) = (f1(x))n+1, inductively. Proof of the

converse is trivial.

Note that Theorem 2.7 allows many constructions of positive sequences. For

example, letting fk(x) = xk we obtain precisely the classical power moment

sequence for any non-decreasing function σ such that the integrals are ﬁnite.
Similarly, letting fk(x) = akx for a nonzero constant a ∈ R or (φ(x))k for any
σ−measurable function φ gives us more positive sequences corresponding to a
non-decreasing functions σ. Theorem 2.7 says that all positive sequences are

obtained in this way.

Now using Theorem 2.7, we can construct positive subsequences from such
moment sequence. Let σ be a non-decreasing function on R and {sk}k∈N0 be a
sequence deﬁned as

sk =Z ∞

−∞

(φ(x))kdσ(x)

for some σ-integrable function φ(x) for which all the above integrals are ﬁnite.
Then for a ﬁxed ℓ ∈ N0 the sequence
−∞(cid:0)(φ(x))ℓ(cid:1)k

dσ(x) =Z ∞

skℓ :=Z ∞

is a positive subsequence of {sk}k∈N0. Given a positive sequence {sk}k∈N0 ,
the problem of identifying all the positive subsequences requires ﬁnding all the
sequences {ℓk} ⊆ N0 such that the sequence given by

(φ(x))kℓdσ(x) = skℓ

−∞

˜sk = sk+ℓk

is a positive sequence.

Theorem 2.8. The sequence {aℓk}k∈N0 is a positive sequence for each a ∈ R if
and only if ℓk = kd + ℓ0 for some d ∈ N0 and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0.
Proof. Suppose ℓk = kd + ℓ0 for some d ∈ N0 and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0. Fix a ∈ R. Deﬁne
δ : R −→ R as a non-decreasing function with only one point of increase ad such
that

aℓ0 = δ(ad + 0) − δ(ad − 0).

7

Then, by the deﬁnition of the Stieltjes integral

aℓk = adk+ℓ0 =Z ∞

−∞

xkdδ(x)

for all k ∈ N0.

Thus, {aℓk}k∈N0 is a positive sequence. Suppose {aℓk}k∈N0 is a positive sequence
for each a ∈ R. Then by Hamburger’s Theorem the corresponding Hankel
matrix Hn is positive semideﬁnite for all n ∈ N0. Since all its principal minors
are nonnegative, aℓ0 ≥ 0 for all a ∈ R, thus ℓ0 ∈ 2N0. Since the following 2 × 2
principal submatrix of Hℓi

aℓi

aℓi+1




aℓi+1

aℓi+2


must have nonnegative determinant,

aℓi aℓi+2 − a2ℓi+1 ≥ 0

for all ℓi ∈ 2N0. Since a ∈ R is arbitrary,

ℓi + ℓi+2 = 2ℓi+1

for all ℓi ∈ 2N0.

(10)

Similarly, using the 2 × 2 principal submatrix of Hℓi

aℓi

aℓi+2




aℓi+2

aℓi+4


ℓi + ℓi+4 = 2ℓi+2

for all ℓi ∈ 2N0.

(11)

By (10) and (11) it follows that the sequence {ℓi, ℓi+1, ℓi+2, ℓi+3, ℓi+4} is
an arithmetic progression for each ℓi ∈ 2N0 and i ∈ N0. Thus, the sequence
{ℓi}i∈N0 has the desired form.

For later use, we note that while showing Theorems 2.5 and 2.8, we also have

proved the following.

Corollary 2.9. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a positive sequence. Then the subsequence
{˜sk}k∈N0 given by ˜sk = sk+ℓk is a positive sequence if {aℓk}k∈N0 is a positive
sequence for each a ∈ R.

3. Relationship between moments and their submoments

Assume that {sk}k∈N0 is a moment sequence and indeterminate. Then the
Hankel matrices Hn corresponding to {sk}k∈N0 are positive semideﬁnite for all
n ∈ N0 and there exist distinct non-decreasing functions σ1 and σ2 such that

sk =Z ∞

−∞

xkdσ1(x)

and sk =Z ∞

−∞

xkdσ2(x)

for all k ∈ N0,

respectively. Let d ∈ N and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0. Let { ˜sk}k∈N0 be the subsequence of
{sk}k∈N0 given by

˜sk := skd+ℓ0

for all k ∈ N0.

Then it is trivial that

Z ∞

−∞

xkd+ℓ0 dσ1(x) =Z ∞

−∞

xkd+ℓ0 dσ2(x)

for all k ∈ N0,

respectively. Since every principal submatrix of a positive (semi)deﬁnite matrix
is positive (semi)deﬁnite, { ˜sk}k∈N0 is positive (semi)deﬁnite. This implies that
there is a nondecreasing function σ such that

˜sk =Z ∞

−∞

xkdσ(x)

for all k ∈ N0.

(12)

That is,

Z ∞

−∞

xkdσ(x) =Z ∞

−∞

xkd+l0 dσ1(x) =Z ∞

−∞

xkd+l0 dσ2(x)

for all k ∈ N0. Note that even though there are two distinct non-decreasing
functions σ1 and σ2, it is not clear whether such a non-decreasing function σ is

unique or not.

As mentioned earlier, the result characterizing the determinacy by the eigen-

value of the Hankel matrices exists as follows [5].

Theorem 3.1. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a moment sequence and λn be the smallest
eigenvalue of its Hankel matrix Hn. Then {sk}k∈N0 is determinate if and only
if λn → 0 as n → ∞. Furthermore, in the indeterminate case the positive lower
bound is explicitly found.

9

Using the preceding theorem one can show the following.

Theorem 3.2. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a positive sequence and { ˜sk}k∈N0 be its subse-
quence given by ˜sk = skd+ℓ0 for d ∈ N and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0. If {sk}k∈N0 is indetermi-
nate, then { ˜sk}k∈N0 is indeterminate.
Proof. Let Hn and ˜Hn be n× n Hankel matrices corresponding to {sk}k∈N0 and
{ ˜sk}k∈N0, respectively. Since {sk}k∈N0 is indeterminate, by Theorem 3.1 the
smallest eigenvalues of Hn have a positive lower bound C > 0, Let λ and ˜λn
be the smallest eigenvalues of Hn and ˜Hn, respectively. Since ˜Hn is a principal
submatrix of Hn, by the Cauchy interlacing theorem ˜λn ≥ λn ≥ C > 0 for all
n ∈ N0. So ˜λn has the positive lower bound C for all n ∈ N0. Thus { ˜sk}k∈N0 is
indeterminate.

It is easy to note that this also implies that if { ˜sk}k∈N0 is determinate,
then {sk}k∈N0 is also determinate. Thus, determinacy of the {sk}k∈N0 may be
deduced from a sparse subsequence of the original sequence.

Given two positive sequences {sk}k∈N0 and {˜sk}k∈N0 with moment solutions
σ and ˜σ respectively, if σ(x) = ˜σ(x), then it is clear that sk = ˜sk for all k ∈ N0.
Therefore the moment solutions to any two distinct positive sequences can never

be equal. Uniqueness in this correspondence raises the question of how σ(x) and

˜σ(x) compare.

Example 3.3. Consider a positive sequence {sk}k∈N0 with its moment solution
σ. If some of the terms from {sk}k∈N0 are missing then we obtain a subsequence
which, if positive, gives another moment solution. For an appropriately chosen
{ℓk} ⊆ N0, assume that ˜sk = sk+ℓk is positive and has the moment solution ˜σ.

Theorem 3.4. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a positive sequence and {˜sk}k∈N0 be its subse-
quence given by ˜sk = sk+ℓ0 for a ﬁxed ℓ0 ∈ 2N0. Let σ and ˜σ be the moment
solutions of the sequences {sk}k∈N0 and {˜sk}k∈N0, respectively. If one of the

Φ2(f (x))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤Z ∞
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Now for any function f ∈ L2

Φ(f (x)) = Φ1(f (x)) − Φ2(f (x))

is a bounded linear functional.

Due to the given determinacy of the moment problems, the set of polynomials is

dense in L2

σ or L2

˜σ. Hence the set of polynomials is dense in L2

σ∩L2

˜σ. Therefore, by

the Hahn-Banach Theorem, Φ is identically zero. Thus equation (15) holds.

11

The above theorem is particularly useful when the ﬁrst ﬁnitely many mo-

ments are missing.

It says that we can ﬁnd the moment solution with the

remaining data. Whether the moment solution of the subsequence is determi-

nate or not is to be studied more carefully in comparison with the determinacy

of the moment solution of the original sequence. It is, however, known that the
ﬁrst term in the subsequence {sk+ℓ0}k∈N0 can be modiﬁed to make the moment
problem determinate, but the solution will not remain the same.

The following theorem gives us a relation between L2 spaces related to a

moment sequence and its submoment sequence. Here we require an evenness

assumption on ℓ0 to guarantee that ν is a nondecreasing measure.

Corollary 3.5. Consider a positive sequence {sk}k∈N0 and its subsequence
{˜sk}k∈N0 given by ˜sk = sk+ℓ0 for some ℓ0 ∈ 2N0. Let σ and ˜σ be the mo-
ment solutions of the sequence and the subsequence, respectively. Then there is

a measure ν, absolutely continuous with respect to σ, such that

Now consider a general submoment sequence {˜sk}k∈N0 given by ˜sk = sk+ℓk
for an appropriate {ℓk} ⊆ N0. It was shown in the previous section that for any
k ∈ N0,

ℓk = kd + ℓ0, where d ∈ N0 and ℓ0 ∈ 2N0,

{˜sk}k∈N0 is a positive sequence. Modifying the functional Φ1 in the proof of
Theorem 3.4 gives the following result.

12

Theorem 3.6. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a positive sequence and {˜sk}k∈N0 be its subse-
quence given by ˜sk = skd+ℓ0 . Let σ and ˜σ respectively be the moment solutions

A precise relation between L2 spaces of moment solutions of the original

sequence and that of one of its positive subsequences can be useful in charac-

terizing the submoment solutions and hence approximating the missing data.

Applying Nevanlinna’s theorem [1] to equation (19) yields the following result

which connects a moment problem with the polynomials corresponding to its

submoment problem.

Theorem 3.7. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a positive sequence and {˜sk}k∈N0 be its subse-
quence given by ˜sk = skd+ℓ0 . Let σ and ˜σ respectively be the moment solutions
of the sequences {sk}k∈N0 and {˜sk}k∈N0. If the moment problem of {˜sk}k∈N0 is

For the shifted subsequence in Theorem 3.4, we want to investigate deter-

minacy of its moment problem of a special submoment sequence in relation

to determinacy of the original moment problem. Recall that the limit circles
K∞(λ) (λ ∈ C and Im λ 6= 0) provide a fundamental concept for studying
determinacy of moment problems.

Then Theorem 3.8 states that

w˜σ(λ) = C + λℓ0 wσ(λ)

(22)

for {sk}k∈N0 and {˜sk}k∈N0 speciﬁed in that theorem. Recall that points wσ
and w˜σ lie on the circumferences of the circles K∞(λ) and ˜K∞(λ) correspond-
ing to the moment problems of {sk}k∈N0 and {˜sk}k∈N0 respectively. Equation
(22) precisely describes the distortion of the circle corresponding to the original

moment sequence in relation to its tail.

4. Perturbation or Modiﬁcation of Moment Sequences

Assume that s0 > |sk| for all k ∈ N. Then we can have a wide range of
choices for s0 keeping the rest of terms constant and maintaining positivity. An

important application of modiﬁcation in s0 is that it can lead to a determinate

solution. It was proved by Stieltjes in his 1894-Memoir [11] that a determinate

moment solution can be obtained from an indeterminate one with a modiﬁcation

in s0. The moment sequence sn = q

−(n+1)2

gives the Stieltjes-Wigert polyno-

mials Pn(x; q), which are orthogonal in a log-normal distribution, known to be

14

indeterminate. The modiﬁed sequence {˜sk}k∈N0 deﬁned as

and ˜sn = sn for all n ≥ 1 has a determinate moment solution ˜σ(x) given by

An example of an application of modiﬁed moments to harmonic solids is given

in [6].

To study the stability of perturbation of moment sequences with arbitrary

sequences, the following well known lemma is useful [13].

Lemma 4.1. Let {tk}k∈N0 be an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. Then there
exists a signed measure µ of bounded variation such that

Z ∞

−∞

xkdµ(x) = tk, k = 0, 1, 2,···

Let {sk}k∈N0 be a positive sequence, and σ be a corresponding positive
measure generating it. By the Hahn-Jordan theorem, since a signed measure

of bounded variation µ can be decomposed into a diﬀerence of two nonnegative
measures µ1 and µ2, µ = µ1−µ2, perturbation of the moment sequence {sk}k∈N0
by the sequence {tk}k∈N0 is a moment sequence if and only if σ− µ2 is a positive
measure, i.e. µ2(E) ≤ σ(E) for every σ-measurable set E. Since this readily
implies that µ2 is absolutely continuous with respect to σ, letting f ∈ L1(dσ)
denote the Radon-Nikodym derivative of µ2 with respect to σ, the above holds if
and only if |f| ≤ 1 σ-a.e. Since µ2 is also a nonnegative measure, 0 ≤ f ≤ 1. We
shall say that a signed measure µ is dominated by σ, if there exists an f ∈ L1(σ),
0 ≤ f ≤ 1, such that the negative part of µ, µ2, satisﬁes dµ2 = f dσ.

15

Theorem 4.2. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a moment sequence and {tk}k∈N0 be an arbitrary
sequence for which the signed measure generating it is dominated by σ. Then
{sk + tk}k∈N0 is a moment sequence.

Clearly if µ is dominated by σ, then εµ is also dominated by σ, for all

0 ≤ ε ≤ 1.

While Theorem 4.2 gives a condition for the perturbation of a moment se-
quence {sk}k∈N0 by an arbitrary sequence {tk}k∈N0 so that {sk + εtk}k∈N0 is a
moment sequence for 0 ≤ ε ≤ 1, this condition is in terms of the signed measure
generating the sequence {tk}k∈N0 and can be quite diﬃcult to verify in practice.
For a truncated moment sequence, perturbations prescribed by Theorem 4.2

are relatively easy to describe. Recall that by the Tchakaloﬀ’s theorem [10], if
{sk}k∈N0 is a truncated moment sequence, then there exist {p1,··· , pm} ⊂ R
and ci > 0, such that

m

σ =

ciδpi,

(23)

Xi=1

where δpi is an unit point masse at pi. Then it holds the following statement.

Corollary 4.3. Let {sk}k∈N0 be a truncated moment sequence generated by
σ with the form (23) and {tk}k∈N0 be an arbitrary real sequence generated by
µ = µ1−µ2. Then {sk +tk}k∈N0 is a moment sequence if and only if the support
of µ2 is in the support of σ and if dj ≥ 0 is the weight of the point masses of µ2
at pj, then dj ≤ cj.

Proof. Let σ be an atomic measure as speciﬁed by Tchakaloﬀ’s theorem. For σ

to dominate µ2, since µ2 << σ, the support of µ2 is a subset of the support of
σ. For σ − µ2 to be a positive measure, we must have the weight of the point
masses of µ2 at pj must be less than cj. Hence the necessary part follows. The

converse is obvious.

For a non-truncated moment sequence {sk}k∈N0 , letting {t1,k}k∈N0 and {t2,k}k∈N0

be the two positive sequences generated by the positive and negative parts of

16

the signed measure µ in Lemma 4.1, tk = t1,k − t2,k. Then

t2,2k =Z ∞

−∞

x2kdµ2(x) =Z ∞

−∞

x2kf (x)dσ(x) ≤ s2k.

However, a simple condition on t2,2k+1 to guarantee that {sk − t2,k}k∈N0 is a
positive sequence for an arbitrary positive sequence {sk}k∈N0 eludes us at this
time.
