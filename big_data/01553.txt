We propose and analyze an all-magnetic scheme to perform a Young’s double slit experiment
with a micron-sized superconducting sphere of mass (cid:38) 1013 amu. We show that its center of mass
could be prepared in a spatial quantum superposition state with an extent of the order of half a
micrometer. The scheme is based on magnetically levitating the sphere above a superconducting
chip and letting it skate through a static magnetic potential landscape where it interacts for short
intervals with quantum circuits. In this way a protocol for fast quantum interferometry is passively
implemented. Such a table-top earth-based quantum experiment would operate in a parameter
regime where gravitational energy scales become relevant.
In particular we show that the faint
parameter-free gravitationally-induced decoherence collapse model, proposed by Diósi and Penrose,
could be unambiguously falsiﬁed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Preparing a massive object in a spatial quantum super-
position over distances comparable to its size is a tantaliz-
ing possibility. This has been achieved in seminal exper-
iments on matter-wave interferometry of molecules [1–4],
which hold a mass record of 104 amu [5]. Particularly
intriguing would be to increase the mass in these exper-
iments such that one could enter into the gravitational
quantum regime (GQR), which we deﬁne as follows. For
a solid sphere of radius R and mass M, we deﬁne the
timescale τG ≡ 2Rh/(GM 2), where h is the Planck’s con-
stant and G the Newton’s gravitational constant. τG has
three interpretations: (i) it is the conjectured lifetime of
a quantum superposition state of a single sphere delocal-
ized over a distance 2R, according to the parameter-free
gravitationally-induced decoherence collapse model pro-
posed by Diósi and Penrose [6, 7], (ii) h/τG is the kinetic
energy of two spheres equivalent to their gravitational
interaction energy when separated by a distance 2R, a
situation that could be used to measure G [8], (iii) τG
is the timescale required to entangle the motion of two
spheres separated by a distance 2R using the gravita-
tional interaction [9, 10]. For a given mass density, one
can plot τG as a function of M, see Fig. 1. We deﬁne the
GQR as the regime in which τG < τ, where τ is a charac-
teristic time scale of the quantum system for each of the
three interpretations of τG. In particular: in (i) τ is the
coherence time of the superposition taking into account
standard sources of decoherence, in (ii) 2π/τ could be the
trap frequency of a harmonic potential where two spheres
are cooled near to their respective ground states, and in
(iii) 1/τ could be the decoherence rate of the spheres that
one wants to entangle using the gravitational interaction,
such that in the GQR a strong coherent gravitational
coupling is achieved. Choosing τ to be of the order of
1 second, which is an ambitious timescale for quantum

experiments, one sees in Fig. 1 that τG < 1 s pertains to
masses > 1012 amu. The goal of this article is to propose
an earth-based experimental scenario that allows one to
access the GQR.

In the last few years, objects with masses ranging from
1011 amu to 1013 amu have been brought to the quan-
tum regime in the context of quantum nano- and mi-
cromechanical oscillators by cooling their associated me-
chanical degree of freedom to its quantum ground state
[11–14]. While clamped micro-oscillators are many or-
ders of magnitude more massive than the molecules used
in current matter-wave interferometers, their mass is nev-
ertheless delocalized over tiny distances smaller than the
size of a single atom, which prevents them to enter into
the GQR, especially in the context of (i). Levitated quan-
tum nano-mechanical oscillators, in particular quantum
optomechanics with optically levitated nanospheres [15–
21], have been suggested as a tool for increasing the
mass of optical matter-wave interferometers while keep-
ing large delocalization distances [22–24]. As shown in
Fig. 1, these all-optical hybrid schemes using the best of
matter-wave interferometry and quantum optomechanics

space environment [25, 26], limited to masses between 108
and 1011 amu, putting them still away from the GQR.
Here we propose a new approach to attain spatially
large quantum superpositions of masses (cid:38) 1013 amu,
well inside the GQR, by abandoning the use of lasers
and using instead an all-magnetic on-chip architecture.
This approach combines the following salient features:
(i) cryogenic temperatures both for environment and the
massive particle to minimize decoherence due to emis-
sion, scattering, and absorption of black-body radiation,
(ii) the use of static magnetic potentials created by persis-
tent currents to magnetically levitate the sphere without
creating decoherence (space environment is not required)
as well as to exponentially speed-up quantum dynamics
by using inverted potentials, and (iii) coupling the posi-
tion of the sphere to quantum circuits on an integrated
on-chip conﬁguration to cool the center-of-mass motion
to the ground state, to make a double-slit smaller than
the size of the sphere by measuring the squared center-
of-mass position, and to measure the interference pattern
downstream. These tools permit, in principle, to make
an all-magnetic Young’s double slit experiment, in less
than a second, on-earth, with a superconducting micro-
sphere of radius 1 µm, mass 1013 amu, and with a slit
separation of half a micrometer.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec. II we discuss
the main challenges that a proposal aiming at preparing
large quantum superpositions of a massive object has to
overcome. The discussion of these challenges aims at mo-
tivating both the protocol and the implementation of our
proposal. In Sec. III we describe the quantum interfer-
ometer protocol as well as how to analytically calculate
all the steps of the protocol taking into account decoher-
ence. This enables us to analytically obtain the inter-
ference pattern as a function of all the physical parame-
ters of the protocol and environmental decoherence. In
Sec. IV we propose and analyze an all-magnetic on-chip
implementation of the quantum interferometer protocol
for a superconducting microsphere.
In Sec. V we ana-
lyze a case study with a set of experimental parameters,
whose complete list is given in the Appendix. This is an
example, where the experimental parameters have not
been ﬁne-tuned, which shows the feasibility to enter in
the gravitational quantum regime such that parameter-
free gravitational-induced decoherence could be unam-
biguously falsiﬁed. We draw our conclusions and provide
some ﬁnal remarks in Sec. VI.

II. CHALLENGES

Let us discuss three fundamental challenges that will
need to be overcome by proposals aiming to prepare
large superpositions of a massive object in the GQR: un-
avoidable decoherence, slow quantum dynamics, and the
double-slit. These challenges are discussed in a general
fashion without considering any implementation. They

2

will serve as a motivation to introduce the quantum in-
terferometer protocol in Sec. III and the implementation
in Sec. IV that we propose to overcome them.

A. Unavoidable decoherence

Consider a sphere of radius R whose center-of-mass
position along the x-axis is described by the quantum
state ˆρ. Most sources of decoherence of the center-of-
mass position are of the position localization (PL) type
(see, for example [23, 27, 28]). PL decoherence makes the
oﬀ-diagonal terms of the density matrix in the position
basis decay exponentially in time. In the so called long
wavelength (LW) limit, where decoherence events provide
only partial which-path information, it can be shown that
hx|ˆρ(t)|x0i ∝ exp[−Λ(x − x0)2t]hx|ˆρ(0)|x0i, where Λ is
the localization parameter. In this regime decoherence is
modeled by the master equation

˙ρ(t) = 1

i[ ˆH, ˆρ] − Λ[ˆx, [ˆx, ˆρ]],

(1)
where ˆH is the Hamiltonian of the system. In the short
wavelength (SW) limit, where decoherence events provide
a full which-path information, one has that hx|ˆρ(t)|x0i ∝
exp[−γt]hx|ˆρ(0)|x0i.

As discussed in [23] most of the paradigmatic collapse
models predict, at the level of density matrices, a PL
decoherence. In particular, the eﬀect of the parameter-
free gravitationally induced collapse model, conjectured
by Penrose and Diósi [6, 7], can be described with the LW
limit of the PL decoherence with a lozalization parameter
given by [23]

ΛG = GM 2
2R3 .

(2)
Here G is the Newton’s gravitational constant. Note
that ΛG is parameter-free, namely, it does not depend
on any phenomenological parameter. Combining Eqs. 1
and 2, we can immediately see that the correlations in
a spatial quantum superposition of extent R decay as
hR/2|ˆρ(t)|−R/2i ∝ exp[−t/τG]hR/2|ˆρ(0)|−R/2i, where
τ−1
G = ΛGR2 is the timescale used in Fig. 1 to deﬁne the
GQR.
In order to falsify such an exotic source of decoher-
ence, which predicts the breakdown of standard quan-
tum mechanics, one has to account for and control the
standard sources of decoherence that are expected in an
implementation. We discuss in the following inevitable
sources of decoherence: scattering of air molecules, emis-
sion, absorption, and scattering of black-body radiation,
and stochastic forces due to vibrations.

Decoherence due to scattering of air molecules, with a
thermal wavelength typically smaller than the superpo-
sition size of interest, is described by PL decoherence in
the SW limit [23]. The decoherence rate is given by

γa = 16π

(3)

where P is the environmental pressure, Te is the envi-
ronmental temperature, and ma is the mass of an air
molecule.
In order to preserve coherence, the quan-
tum interferometer should be implemented in a time
T (cid:28) γ−1
a , namely, it is required that the sphere does
not scatter any air molecule during each run of the pro-
tocol. For a sphere of R = 1 µm in an optimal cryogenic
environment with Te = 50 mK and P = 10−17 mbar, the
a ≈ 4 s. Hence, a single
coherence time is given by γ−1
run of the quantum interferometer has to be performed
in a timescale of the order of a second or less. Combined
with the slow quantum dynamics of large masses, as we
discuss below, this poses a challenge. Note that γ−1
is
an upper-bound for the time scale τ used to deﬁne the
GQR, especially regarding interpretations (i) and (iii).

Decoherence due to scattering, absorption, and emis-
sion of black-body radiation is described by PL decoher-
ence in the LW, since the wavelength of thermal photons
is typically much larger than the superposition size. The
localization parameter is given by Λbb = Λs

sphere is the same as the environmental Te. These local-
ization parameters depend on the dielectric permittivity

Hence, in order to minimize the eﬀect of decoherence
due to black-body radiation, such that gravitationally-
induced decoeherence would dominate, the quantum in-
terferometer should be implemented in a cryogenic envi-
ronment.

Any experiment will suﬀer from unavoidable vibra-
tional noise. Let us describe the vibrational noise that
delocalizes the sphere along the x direction by the ﬂuctu-
ating variable ξx(t), which has the dimensions of distance
and fulﬁlls hξx(t)i = 0, while hξx(t)ξx(t0)i 6= 0. The noise
is characterized by

Sxx(ω) =

dτhξx(t + τ)ξx(t)ieiωτ ,

(8)

the vibrational noise leads to a time-dependent stochas-
tic force given by f(t) ≡ −V 0[ξx(t)]. The Hamiltonian of
the system can then be written as ˆH(t) = ˆH + f(t)ˆx. For
a harmonic potential of the form V (ˆx) = M ω2
pˆx2/2 with
the stochastic force due to vibrations given by f(t) =
−M ω2
pξx(t), one can show [29, 30] that by averaging the
stochastic force, one obtains a master equation for the dy-
namics. For the particular case of Sxx(ωp) = Sxx(−ωp),
this master equation is of the PL decoherence form in the
LW limit with a localization parameter given by

Λv = M 2ω4

p

22 Sxx(ωp).

(9)

Note that the decoherence due to vibrations scales as
M 2 with the mass of the sphere and as ω4
p for the trap-
ping frequency, since the stochastic force is proportional
p for a harmonic potential. Also, as expected,
to M ω2
the stochastic force is zero when the particle is not in
an external potential. In order to falsify gravitationally-
induced decoherence in the presence of an external po-
tential, the decoherence induced by such ﬂuctuations has
pSxx(ωp)/(G) < 1, which be-
to satisfy Λv/ΛG = R3ω4
comes increasingly challenging with the size of the sphere.
In particular, for a sphere of R = 1 µm one requires
Hz. Thus,
in order to suppress the eﬀects of vibration-induced de-
coherence, the implementation of the quantum interfer-
ometer necessitates a minimal use of external potentials
in addition to substantial vibration isolation.

B. Slow quantum dynamics

In any quantum interferometer scheme there are two
important dynamical processes that require some time:
the generation of a large enough coherence length, to be
deﬁned below, and the generation of an interference pat-
tern with suﬃcient visibility, namely that the separation
between the interference fringes is larger than the reso-
lution with which the position can be measured.

In order to deﬁne the coherence length, let us ﬁrst re-
call some properties of an important class of states –
Gaussian states – that can be used to describe the quan-
tum state of the sphere along the x-axis. A quantum
state ˆρ with tr[ˆxˆρ] = tr[ˆpˆρ] = 0 is called Gaussian if it is
completely determined by the following three real param-
eters vx ≡ tr[ˆx2 ˆρ], vp ≡ tr[ˆp2 ˆρ], and c ≡ tr[(ˆxˆp + ˆpˆx)ˆρ]/2
[31]. Indeed, the density matrix of a Gaussian state in
the position basis is given by

which has units of m2/Hz. On applying an external po-
tential V (ˆx) that depends on the position of the sphere,

Here we have used that the purity P ≡ tr[ˆρ2] of a Gaus-
sian state is given by P = [4vxvp − 4c2]−1/2. Note that
the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for a Gaussian state
reads as vxvp − c2 ≥ 2/4.

the compact expression
ξ ≡ P√

The coherence length ξ for a Gaussian state is deﬁned
2πvx, and is given by

(12)
The coherence length scales with the position variance
as √
vx, as expected, with a scaling factor given by the
purity of the state. For a Gaussian state with a coherence
length ξ incident on a double slit of separation d, one will
observe a coherent superposition resulting in interference
fringes for ξ (cid:29) d and an incoherent mixture for ξ (cid:28) d.
It is straightforward to show that during free expan-
sion of the wavefunction without decoherence, or in other
words, under unitary evolution with ˆH = ˆp2/(2M), the
coherence length grows at a speed given by

8vx.

(13)

Starting out in the ground state of a harmonic potential
with frequency ω, such that P = 1 and vp(0) = ωM/2,
then limt→∞ ˙ξ(t) = (4ω/M)1/2. Note that the larger
the mass the slower the coherence length grows. For a
sphere of R = 1 µm, mass density 104 Kg/m3 initially in
a harmonic trap of frequency ω = 2π×105 Hz, the speed
at which the coherence length grows is 71 nm/s. Since
we would like to have ξ of the order of R, this speed in
free expansion poses a challenge for propagation times of
the order of a second, as required to prevent decoherence
due to scattering of air molecules.

Even more challenging is the time required to gener-
ate suﬃciently separated fringes. It is known in matter-
wave interferometery that after the Gaussian state passes
through a double slit of separation d (cid:28) ξ, one obtains a
coherent superposition which after free expansion down-
stream generates, in the absence of decoherence, an in-
terference pattern with a fringe spacing

xf = 2πt

M d

.

(14)

The fringe separation speed is thus given by ˙xf =
2π/(M d). For a sphere of R = 1 µm, mass density
104 Kg/m3, and assuming a double slit of separation
d = 2R, the speed is given by ˙xf ≈ 10−5nm/s which
is very small. For example, assuming a position mea-
surement resolution of 1 nm, one would require 105 s to
obtain resolvable fringes. This deﬁnitely poses a very
important challenge.

C. Double slit

The ﬁnal challenge is to prepare a quantum superpo-
sition of the center-of-mass position of the sphere, which

4

should ideally be done without any decoherence. This
is a non-Gaussian operation that transforms a Gaussian
state with a positive Wigner function into a non-Gaussian
state with a negative Wigner function. The preparation
of non-Gaussian states has been a major goal and a rather
formidable challenge in quantum nanomechanics [14]. A
double slit in a Young’s experiment is a beautiful example
of how this can be done. However, in a double slit one is
typically forced to prepare spatial superpositions which
are larger than the size of the object, namely d > 2R.
For large masses this condition might be too demanding
as it could compromise the conditions required to meet
the challenges discussed before. For instance the larger
the superposition the longer it takes for fringes to be
generated for the ﬁnal measurement. Hence it might be
advantageous to prepare superpositions with an extent
not necessarily larger than the diameter of the sphere.
Implementing a double slit with a slit separation smaller
than the size of the sphere is a seemingly naive challenge,
but an important one to meet when taking into account
the constraints posed by the slow quantum dynamics and
the unavoidable sources of decoherence.

III. QUANTUM INTERFEROMETER:

PROTOCOL

In this section we propose and analyze a quantum in-
terferometer protocol for a massive object. The protocol
will be designed in a manner such that two of the chal-
lenges discussed in Sec. II, namely that of slow quantum
dynamics and of the double slit, are addressed. A de-
tailed implementation of the protocol for the speciﬁc case
of a superconducting sphere is proposed and analysed in
Sec. IV. This implementation is designed to overcome the
unavoidable decoherence challenge. Thus in this section
we keep the discussion general without reference to any
particular implementation.

The quantum interferometer protocol is divided into 7

steps (see Fig. 2);

1. Cooling. Cooling the center-of-mass motion in a
harmonic trap of frequency ω1 for a duration t1 to
a ﬁnal phonon occupation number ¯n.

2. Boost. Evolution of the center-of-mass motion in
an inverted harmonic potential of frequency ω2 for
a time t2 which exponentially boosts the sphere’s
kinetic energy.

3. Free. Free evolution for a time t3 to delocalize the

center-of-mass over large distances.

4. Split. A squared position measurement for a time

t4 to prepare a quantum superposition state.

5. Rotation. A short evolution for a duration t5 in
a harmonic trap of frequency ω5 to give opposite
momentum to the two wave packets in the super-
position.

panels show a contour plot of the Wigner function, where the vertical (horizontal) axis represents p (x), and the blue (orange)

plotted functions of the diﬀerent steps are not scaled and arbitrary units are shown, only the functional form has relevant
information.

by T =P7

The total time of the protocol after cooling is thus given
n=2 tn. The position of the center-of-mass of
the sphere is given by r = (ˆx, y, z), where ˆx is the position
of the center of along the direction in which the quantum
superposition is prepared. The other degrees of freedom
are assumed to be in a thermal classical state with a tem-
perature as low as possible. Steps 1 to 3 of the protocol
are used to create a large and coherent matter-wave of
the center of mass of the sphere along the x-axis. These
are the steps used to generate an observable diﬀerence
between the state of the sphere when one includes the
existence of gravitationally-induced decoherence and one
does not. In particular, the coherence length after step
3, ξ, takes a reduced value ξG < ξ when gravitationally-
induced decoherence is taken into account. In order to
falsify gravitationally-induced decoherence we aim at op-
erating the interferometer in a regime where ξG (cid:28) d < ξ,
for a given slit separation d. This implies that the double
slit prepares a coherent superposition in the absence of
gravitationally-induced decoherence, and an incoherent
mixture otherwise. Steps 4 to 7 consist of performing
the double slit operation and unveiling the interference
fringes for the case in which the coherent superposition
has been prepared. These steps have to be done unitar-
ily such that if one prepares a coherent superposition the
visibility of the interference fringes is not washed out.
Thus, we emphasize that steps 1 to 3 are used to create
the diﬀerence between the state with and without the ex-
istence of gravitationally induced decoherence, and steps
4 to 7 are used to demonstrate this diﬀerence.

In the following we show how the probability posi-
tion distribution along the x-axis after step 7, namely

P(x) = hx|ˆρ(T)|xi, can be analytically calculated tak-
ing into account PL decoherence in the LW limit and all
the parameters describing the protocol. We divide the
discussion into the separate steps of the protocol.

A. Step 1: Cooling

In this step, which takes place from t = −t1 to t = 0,
the center-of-mass motion of the microsphere along the
x-axis is cooled using a linear quantum nanomechanical
coupling to cavity mode [32–35]. The particle is conﬁned
in a harmonic trap of frequency ω1, such that its zero-

point motion length is given by σ1 =p/(2M ω1). The

total Hamiltonian describing the coupling of the particle
to a driven cavity mode of frequency ωc1 and creation
(annihilation) mode operators ˆa† (ˆa) is given by

H1

 = − ∆0ˆa†ˆa + ω1ˆb†ˆb + glˆa†ˆa

(cid:0)ˆa − ˆa†(cid:1) .

− iE1

(cid:16)ˆb + ˆb†(cid:17)

(15)

The above Hamiltonian is given in a rotating frame with
the drive frequency ωl1, and we use ˜x = ˆx/σ1 = (ˆb + ˆb†)
with [ˆb,ˆb†] = 1, ∆0 = ωl1 − ωc1, E1 is the strength of the
coherent drive that couples to the quantum cavity, and
gl is the linear quantum nanomechanical coupling. We
linearize the system by making the change of variables
ˆa → α1 + ˆa and ˆb → β1 +ˆb, and choosing α1 and β1 such
that

iE1 − (∆0 + iκ1) α1 + glα1 (β1 + β∗

1) = 0
ω1β1 + gl|α1|2 = 0.

(16)
(17)
Assuming that gl |α1| /(2κ1) (cid:28) 1 and neglecting the de-
coherence in the center-of-mass motion, one can elimi-
nate the cavity mode degree of freedom ˆa and write an
eﬀective master equation for the reduced density matrix

of the sphere. This master equation leads to the follow-
ing rate equation for the phonon number of the sphere
center-of-mass degree of freedom:

operators in the master equation are linear in ˆx and ˆp.
Thus the parameters characterizing the Gaussian state
at t = t2 can be obtained by analytically solving

with the additional assumption that the bath attached to
the cavity mode is at zero temperature. In this case the
damping and driving terms of the above rate equation
are given by

An additional heating source in the center-of-mass mo-
tion at a rate Γ can be easily included by replacing A+
with A+ + Γ. Note that when the coupling to the cavity
mode is turned on for the cooling process, the equilib-
rium position of the sphere along x shifts to the mean
ﬁeld value β1 6= 0. One can expect that as the coupling
is turned oﬀ slowly the cooled state of the particle will
be adiabatically shifted to ˜x = 0.

At t = 0 the center-of-mass motion along the x-axis is

thus prepared in a Gaussian state given by

This state has a purity P = 1/(2¯n + 1) and an initial
coherence length given by ξ(0) =
2¯n + 1. Owing
to the large mass, the coherence length at this step will be
typically much smaller than the size of a single atom. Our
goal is to expand it to a value of the order of the radius of
the sphere, that is, by many orders of magnitude. This
is what we do in the next two steps of the protocol.

After boosting the momentum ﬂuctuations of the cen-

of PL decoherence with a localization parameter Λ3. De-

to be apparent at this point.

B. Step 2: Boost

D. Step 4: Split

As discussed in Sec. II, in free space the coherence
length of the state (21) grows with a speed given by
limt→∞ ˙ξ(t) = 2(2¯n + 1)−1/2(ω1/M)1/2.
In order to
increase this speed, in step 2 (boost) the center-of-mass
evolves in an inverted harmonic potential of frequency ω2
from t = 0 to t = t2 such that vp is boosted by a fac-
tor of exp[2ω2t2]. Assuming PL decoherence in the long
wavelength limit, with a localization parameter Λ2, the
dynamics preserves the Gaussian character of the state
at t = 0 since the Hamiltonian is quadratic and the jump

In this step the spatially delocalized wavefunction is
split by means of a double slit into a spatial superposition
of two localized wavepackets. As discussed in Sec. II, it
would be convenient to obtain a slit separation d smaller
than the diameter of the sphere. We propose to achieve
this by performing a continuous time quantum measure-
ment of ˆx2. The measurement outcome will determine
the slit separation, and the strength of the measurement
the width of the slits. The idea of using an ˆx2 measure-
ment of a nanosphere to prepare a quantum superposition

surement was approximated to be instantaneous, here we
address the more general situation considering that the
measurement takes a ﬁnite time t4.

The measurement is modeled as follows. We consider
the sphere to be quadratically coupled with a cavity
mode that is resonantly driven with a strength E4. The
quadratic coupling strength is given by gq, and in this
step it is convenient to use the length unit σ4 = ξ(T3) =

The decay rate of the cavity is given by κ4. We assume
that a homodyne measurement of the phase quadrature
of the output cavity ﬁeld is performed, such that the
evolution of the density matrix ˆρT describing the center-
of-mass motion and the cavity mode is given by the fol-

pendent of A. This is justiﬁed since φ evolves much
Θ ≡ c(T3)/(2) (cid:29) 1. Recall that to keep the pu-
rity constant, one requires c2(T3) to be comparable to
vx(T3)vp(T3) which at T3, after expanding the coherence
length many orders of magnitude, is much larger than
2/4. Using φ(˜x, ˜x0, T3) as the initial condition, φ is given
by φ(˜x, ˜x0, T4) = F(t4)(˜x2 − ˜x02) with

Using this one can thus solve Eq. (28) to obtain the time-

ence term and the contribution of phase gradients to the
amplitude dynamics in Eq. (28), which lead to negligible
contributions for the experimental parameters given in
Sec. V, and enforcing that F(t4) ≈ 0, the density matrix
at t4 is given by

One aspect of realising such a double slit is that the slit
separation Eq. (33) depends on the measurement out-
come pL and will vary from run to run. As a result in
our proposal we have to post-select a suitable slit-width
that satisﬁes ξG (cid:28) d (cid:46) ξ which will enable us to falsify
gravitationally-induced decoherence. To this end it is
advantageous also to have at hand the probability distri-
bution for the slit separation d for a given measurement

to be well separated and at the maximum dmax = ξ(T3).

At this step, the state after a double slit of separation d
has been prepared. As discussed in Sec. II, the generation
of fringes in free expansion would require an unfeasibly
long time. In the next two steps, we propose a method
to overcome this challenge.

E. Step 5: Rotation

In the next two steps, step 5 (rotation), and step 6
(inﬂation), we will ensure that the fringes separate ex-
ponentially in time instead of linearly as implied by dy-
namics in free space. To achieve this, ﬁrst, in step 5

(rotation), we let the system evolve with the Hamilto-
nian ˆH5 = ˆp2/(2M) + M ω2
5 ˆx2/2 during a time t5, such
that ˆx and ˆp evolve in the Heisenberg picture as

8

ˆx(T5) = ˆx(T4) cos(ω5t5) + ˆp(T4)
ˆp(T5) = ˆp(T4) cos(ω5t5) − M ω5ˆx(T4) sin(ω5t5).

sin(ω5t5),

M ω5

(38)

Here, for simplicity, we have ignored decoherence for the
moment. In step 6 (inﬂation), the system evolves with
the Hamiltonian ˆH6 = ˆp2/(2M) − M ω2
6 ˆx2/2 for a time
t6, such that ˆx and ˆp evolve in the Heisenberg picture as
ˆx(T6) = ˆx(T5) cosh(ω6t6) + ˆp(T5)
ˆp(T6) = ˆp(T5) cosh(ω6t6) + M ω6ˆx(T5) sinh(ω6t6).

Thus ˆx(T6) is proportional to ˆp(T4) with a coeﬃcient
that grows exponentially with ω6t6. Therefore one can
perform an exponentially fast time-of-ﬂight measurement
of the momentum distribution at t = T4 by measuring the
position distribution at t = T6. Note that for ω5 = ω6
the condition Eq. (41) is satisﬁed with ω5t5 = π/4. We
remark that should one be interested in measuring the
probability distribution of another quadrature at t = T4,
one could adjust t5 accordingly.

Motivated by the discussion above, let us calculate the
state obtained after rotation for a time t5. Since after
step 4 (split), the state is non-Gaussian, its evolution
has to be calculated more carefully. In this context, it is
convenient to use the Wigner function

This gives the exact solution of the evolved Wigner func-

Hamiltonian the evolution of the Wigner function in
the absence of decoherence is given by WΛ=0(x, p, t) =
WΛ=0(x(t), p(t), 0), where x(t) and p(t) are the classical
solutions given by the Hamilton equations.

In order to quantify the eﬀect of decoherence during
the rotation, it is convenient to deﬁne dimensionless vari-
ables: ¯kx ≡ σxkx, ¯kp ≡ σpkp and ¯t ≡ ω5t5, for some given
length and momentum units σx and σp. Then,

show that the fringes separation grows exponentially in
time approximately as xf ≈ exp[t6ω6]2π/(M dω6).
It
will thus be important that decoherence during the in-
ﬂation step is low enough such that σΛ/xf (cid:28) 1 at T6 so
that the interference pattern is not washed out.
Note that the position probability distribution of the
center-of-mass after the step 6 (inﬂation) can be calcu-
lated analytically taking into account all the experimen-
tal parameters and PL decoherence in the long wave-
length limit. This is used in Sec. V to obtain the interfer-
ence pattern for a speciﬁc experimental implementation
of the protocol.

G. Step 7: Measure

σ7 = hˆx2i1/2 = [R ∞

The ﬁnal step (measure) consists in performing a con-
tinuous time measurement of ˆx2 in order to unveil the
fringes Eq. (53). Note that since the interference pattern
has to be symmetric, it is more convenient to directly
measure ˆx2, as is done in step 4 (split). Hence, in this
step the Hamiltonian is given by

where the convenient length scale unit is now given by

the cavity parameters in this step are given by: the res-
onant driving strength E7, the decay rate of the cav-
ity given by κ7, and the classical ﬁeld amplitude in
the empty cavity α7 = −E7/κ7. A homodyne mea-
surement of the phase quadrature of the cavity ﬁeld
is performed assuming, again, the adiabatic approxi-
mation, namely g2

IV. QUANTUM INTERFEROMETER:

IMPLEMENTATION

In this section we propose and analyze a physical set-
up for the implementation of the quantum interferometer
protocol discussed in Sec. III. The proposal is illustrated
in Fig. 3. We consider a superconducting sphere that is
magnetically levitated on top of a superconducting chip,
at some distance z = zt, and skates along the y-axis. The
main ingredients of the implementation are the following:
• The diﬀerent steps of the protocol are implemented
by letting the sphere skate along the y-axis in a
static potential landscape as sketched in Fig. 3b.
The potentials along the x-axis, V (ˆx), act during
the time required for the sphere to skate through
the particular region in the potential landscape.
This is advantageous since the potential is static
and does not need to be switched-on and oﬀ which
can easily cause additional decoherence.

• The potential landscape is generated by persistent
superconducting currents that give rise to a static
magnetic ﬁeld potential that interacts with a super-
conducting microsphere in the Meissner state [40].
Being persistent, the intensity of the currents do
not ﬂuctuate and hence the magnetic potentials are
stable, minimising decoherence arising from trap
ﬂuctuations.

• The cavities required for cooling, splitting, and
measuring the position of the state are imple-
mented with ﬂux-dependent microwave quantum
cavities containing a SQUID. This leads to a quan-
tum magnetomechanical coupling [40–42] between
the sphere and the cavities. These quantum cir-
cuits are positioned on a chip at z = 0, where also
the persistent currents are located. The sphere is
skating along the y-axis but levitated at some dis-
tance z = zt. The SQUIDs are positioned in the
appropriate region of the magnetic landscape such
that when the particle skates over them, the desired
ﬂux-dependent couplings to the particle position
(or squared position) are implemented. Note that
the driving ﬁelds of the cavities can be switched on

10

throughout since the interaction of the sphere with
the cavity will only take place while the sphere is
skating near them.

In order to control the speed at which the sphere skates
along the y-axis, the chip could be conveniently inclined.
A superconducting sphere with optimal properties could
be loaded on a superconducting chip using a magnetic
conveyor as has been experimentally realized with ultra-
cold atoms [43]. Being an on-chip implementation, one
could imagine having a system in which the same sphere
can be reused for each run of the experiment. At the end
of each run the sphere could be brought back to step 1
with an on-chip magnetic conveyor. This would prevent
the run-to-run variations that would necessitate an av-
erage over mass and magnetic properties of the diﬀerent
spheres used to obtain the interference pattern.

In the following we discuss how the magnetic landscape
in Fig. 3b, which we refer to as a magnetic skatepark, can
be implemented with persistent currents. Subsequently
we discuss how steps 1, 4, and 7 can be performed using
a quantum magnetomechanical coupling to a microwave
resonator. Finally we consider decoherence due to mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations arising from the surface, a source
of decoherence which is introduced by choosing this par-
ticular physical implementation.

A. Magnetic skatepark

For a perfect superconducting sphere of volume V in
an applied magnetic ﬁeld B, the Hamiltonian describing
the interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld and the in-
duced dipole [44] of the sphere, whose center of mass is
at position r = (ˆx, y, z) in a gravitational ﬁeld along the
z-axis, is given by [40]

ˆV (r) = χ|B(r)|2 + M gz,

where χ ≡ 3V /4µ0, µ0 is the vacuum magnetic perme-
ability, and g is the eﬀective gravitational acceleration
along the z-axis taking into account the small inclination
of the chip.

The magnetic ﬁeld used to engineer the potential re-
quired in each of the steps of the protocol will be created
by 4 parallel wires [45, 46]. Let us start by considering 4
ideal inﬁnite wires (neglecting their thicknesses) placed
along the y-direction at z = 0. The two interior wires,
separated a distance di, carry a current of strength Ii
in opposite directions. The two outer wires, separated a
distance do, carry a current Io, as sketched in Fig. 4a.
These wires create a magnetic ﬁeld, B(r), that does not
depend on y.
In absence of gravity, analytical expres-
sions of the trapping position can be derived [45, 46].
Considering gravity, we numerically study the properties
of the traps. In particular, we study the normalized po-
tential seen by the sphere as a function of its coordinates
ˆV (r)/E0 = |B(r)|2/B2
0 + ζz/R, where B0 = µ02Ii/(πdi)
is the ﬁeld created by the two inner wires at the origin

ρ is the mass density of the sphere. The properties of
the magnetic potential can be modiﬁed by tuning the
distances and intensities of the wires. For the protocol
discussed in Sec. III, the following potential distributions
are needed:

• Strong attractive potential (step 1): strong con-
ﬁnement in the x-direction, while the particle is
trapped at xp = 0 and zp = zt.
• Inverted potential (steps 2, 6):
inverted potential
in the x direction while the particle is levitating at
zp ≈ zt.
• Free propagation potential (steps 3, 4, 7): ﬂat po-
tential in the x-direction while the particle is levi-
tating at a zp ≈ zt.

• Weak attractive potential (step 5): weak conﬁne-
ment in the x-direction, with a frequency value sim-
ilar to that for the inverted potential while the par-
ticle is trapped at xp = 0 and zp ≈ zt.

All of the diﬀerent potentials required above can be ob-
tained by ﬁxing the current intensities through the wires
and the distance between the interior wires, and only tun-
ing the distance between the outer ones. In Fig. 4b we
plot the absolute value of the trapping frequency in x as a
function of the distance between the outer wires (for the
particular distances and currents used in the case study
Sec. V). In Fig. 4c we plot the corresponding trapping
heights zt. As can be seen from these plots, the mag-
netic potential can be modiﬁed by only tuning the outer
distance between wires, allowing to create the diﬀerent
distributions required for the protocol. The strong at-

protocol and is related to (tr[ˆx2 ˆρ])1/2. The linear and

A tight trap both in x and z-directions is then created.
On the contrary, the inverted potential is obtained by
placing the outer wires closer to the inner ones. In this
case, as do → di, the potential is the same as that created
by a single pair of wires with current (Ii − Io), giving rise
to an inverted potential in x and a stable trapping point
in z due to the gravitational force. Between these two
cases, one can ﬁnd a do value for which the potential in
the x direction at x = 0 changes from being inverted
to attractive, see Fig. 4b. This allows us to design a
ﬂat potential permitting free expansion of the state along
the x-axis. A possible set of experimental numbers for
implementing the protocol are discussed in Sec. V.

These results have been obtained assuming that the
wires are inﬁnitely long. However, we have performed
calculations considering the complete protocol with the
diﬀerent ﬁnite regions as sketched in Fig. 3a. Both trap-
ping heights and potential proﬁles agree well with the
results for inﬁnite guides and transitions from one region
to the other can be made adiabatic by controlling the
lengths of the connections between the diﬀerent regions.
However, taking into account these smooth transitions
in the protocol, and choosing the experimental parame-
ters accordingly in the case study discussed in Sec. V lies
beyond the scope of this manuscript.

B. Cavity Quantum magnetomechanics

L[ˆρ] = 2κ

.

(62)

In steps 1, 4, and 7 a coupling to a cavity mode
is required. This is achieved by a magnetomechanical
coupling between the center-of-mass of the supercon-
ducting microsphere and a microwave resonator with a
SQUID [40–42]. The frequency of the cavity mode is
ﬂux-dependent due to the presence of the SQUID [47],
and it is given by ˆH = ωc(r)ˆa†ˆa, where ˆa† (ˆa) is the
creation (annihilation) cavity mode operator, ωc(r) =
[8EJ(r)EC]1/2 − EC, and EJ(r) = 2EJ1 cos [πΦ(r)/Φ0] .
Here Φ0 is the ﬂux quantum, r is the position of the
superconducting sphere, EC is the charging energy of a
single electron stored in the capacitance, and EJ1 the
energy associated with an electron tunneling across one
of the two identical junctions. The regime EJ /EC (cid:29) 1
is assumed so that the resonator is linear. Note that
the magnetomechanical coupling arises because the ﬂux
threading the pick-up coil Φ(r) depends on r. As before
we denote the position of the sphere as r = (ˆx, y, z) with
ˆx corresponding to the quantum mechanical position op-
erator of the center of mass motion along the x-axis. Ex-
panding the Hamiltonian up to second order in ˆx, one

Thus the Hamiltonian (59) and the dissipative term (62)
are of the same form as those used in Sec. III to dis-
cuss steps 1, 4, and 7. As was remarked in [22], the
non-linear cavity cooperativity due to the quadratic cou-
pling is greatly enhanced due to the large scale given
by (tr[ˆx2 ˆρ])1/2, many orders of magnitude larger than
the typical zero point motion in quantum nanomechani-
cal systems where non-linear couplings are typically very
weak [14].

Let us now discuss the appropriate location for the
pick-up coils on the chip such that the steps 1,4, and 7
of the protocol are passively implemented in the mag-
netic skatepark. We choose to place the pick-up coils
on the chip i.e.
in the z = 0 plane. We consider rect-
angularly shaped coils with lengths along the y and x-
axis given by ly and lx respectively. The magnetic ﬂux
threading the pick up coil Φ has a contribution given by
the ﬁeld created by the induced currents of the super-
conducting sphere and a contribution given by the ﬁeld
created by the wires. With the classical position of the
sphere given by r = (0, 0, zt) and the center of the coil

at the origin rc = (0, 0, 0), the ﬁrst derivative of the ﬂux
respect to the x-position of the sphere is zero due to the
symmetry of the coil and the magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, to
obtain a non-zero linear coupling, ηl, the coil has to be
shifted from the center in the x direction. Restricting
to the available space between the inner wires forming
the magnetic guide (di/R = 13 as used in the case study
Sec. V), the linear coupling ηl can be easily optimized
over xc and lx resulting in a maximum for xc/R = 3 and
lx/R = 6. On increasing the length ly of the coil, the
coupling increases until ly/R ’ 40 and saturates there-
after. Note that the total ﬂux that crosses the coil, which
determines the constant ﬂux coeﬃcient s0 entering into
the quantum magnetomechanical couplings, depends on
its geometrical parameters. Regarding the quadratic cou-
pling, ηq, we consider a centered coil in x, which ensures
that the ﬁrst derivative of the ﬂux with respect to the
x-position of the sphere is zero. Also in this case, both
the magnetomechanical coeﬃcient and the constant ﬂux
coeﬃcient depend on the dimensions of the coil. The
particular experimental numbers used in the case study
Sec. V are given in the Appendix. We emphasize that the
couplings are switched-on and oﬀ dynamically by letting
the sphere skate over the area where the pick-up coils
are located without changing the intensity of the driving
ﬁelds, something that can be advantageous to minimize
decoherence and noise.

C. Magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations

In the on-chip implementation of the quantum inter-
ferometer protocol, potential surface-induced sources of
decoherence could play a role. In particular, as the mi-
crosphere couples to the ﬂuctuations of the electromag-
netic (EM) ﬁeld, both quantum and thermal, we expect
its motion to decohere as a consequence. Such decoher-
ence can be studied using the quantum Brownian motion
(QBM) model [28, 30] with the center of mass motion
as the system, coupled linearly to the bath of EM ﬁeld
modes. In this section, we consider the decoherence in-
duced by the interaction of a diamagnetic particle with
the ﬂuctuations of the electromagnetic ﬁeld near a sur-
face, which could potentially change the density of bath
modes to a large extent. Looking at the interaction be-
tween a diamagnetic particle and the ﬁeld as in Eq. (57),
in the presence of an externally applied classical mag-
netic ﬁeld B(r) with ﬂuctuations ˆBf(r), one can write
the interaction Hamiltonian up to bilinear terms as

hB (r0) · ∂x ˆBf (r0) + ˆBf (r0) · ∂xB (r0)i ˆx,

ˆHI ≈ χ

(63)
where r0 is the classical trajectory of the particle, and
ˆx stands for the quantum ﬂuctuations of the center of
mass position along the x-axis. We have ignored here
the contribution from the interaction terms of third and
higher order in ﬂuctuations of the magnetic ﬁeld and of
the center of mass position. One can then express the

face [48]. Rewriting the interaction Hamiltonian (63)
as HI ≡ ˆCˆx, where one can identify the operator ˆC =
B (r0) · ∂x ˆBf (r0) + ˆBf (r0) · ∂xB (r0) as the bath op-
erator pertaining to the QBM model, one can readily
see that the interaction will yield a position localization
decoherence as the bath monitors the system’s position
coordinate via the linear coupling. Assuming that the
particle is in a harmonic trap of frequency ωt, the de-
coherence resulting from the quantum Brownian motion
can be written as [28, 30]

pared to the trap wavelength (ωtzt/c (cid:28) 1), which corre-
sponds to the quasi-static limit as the response of the
surface is evaluated at a frequency (ωt) that is much
smaller than c/zt. We ﬁnd that the decoherence rate

superconducting metals, we ﬁnd that decoherence due to
magnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations near the surface is much larger
than gravitationally-induced decoherence. Therefore, to
be able to observe gravitationally-induced decoherence,
one needs to place the microsphere near a superconduct-
ing surface. That is, one should use a superconducting
atom chip [52–54].

In this section we consider a particular set of exper-

posed quantum interferometer. This is done considering

Interference pattern obtained for a sphere of R =
1 µm with a mass of M ≈ 2 × 1013 amu in a Young’s double
slit interferometer with slit separation d = 0.5 µm and slit

which takes 25 ms, takes 595 ms. The grey line is obtained
considering standard sources of decoherence and the red one

In
this regime, the observation of interference fringes would un-
ambiguously falsify gravitationally-induced decoherence.

standard sources of decoherence and with (red curve in
Fig. 5) or without (grey curve in Fig. 5) gravitationally-
induced decoherence. With the parameters explicitly
listed in the Appendix, one obtains the interference pat-
tern plot in Fig. 5, indicating that the faint parameter-
free gravitationally-induced decoherence could be unam-
biguously falsiﬁed. Let us emphasize that the set of
parameters that we chose, see Appendix, has not been
ﬁne-tuned.
It is only a representative example and we
anticipate that there would be other sets of parame-
ters that would lead to the same conclusion, namely
that gravitationally-induced decoherence could be falsi-
ﬁed. Of course, some of the important parameters have
been chosen to ensure that the interferometer protocol
is faithfully implemented. In the rest of this section we
discuss and justify the same.

We have considered a superconducting sphere in the
Meissner state with a radius of R = 1 µm and a mass of
M ≈ 2 × 1013 amu, well inside the gravitational quan-
tum regime, as shown in Fig. 1. The superposition size
is determined by the slit separation d = 0.5 µm and slit
width σd ≈ 10.6 nm. The total time of the quantum
interferometer after cooling (which takes t1 = 25 ms) is
T = 596 ms. This time is distributed between the dif-
ferent steps as t2 = 17 ms, t3 = 483 ms, t4 = 11.2 ms,
t5 = 2.5 ms, t6 = 61 ms, and t7 = 20 ms. The har-
monic potentials in steps 2, 5, and 7 have a frequency
of 50 Hz. Note that the longest duration in the oper-
ation of the interferometer is in the free expansion of
step 3, where standard sources of decoherence are min-
imal. The coherence length after step 3 is given by
ξ(T3) ≈ 580 nm without gravitationally-induced decoher-
ence, and ξG(T3) ≈ 120 nm including it. Hence note that

-���-���-���������������������������[��]�(�)the condition ξG (cid:28) d (cid:46) ξ is fulﬁlled. The latter is the
key condition in order to falsify gravitationally-induced
decoherence, as shown in Fig. 5. Steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 are
intended to build the interference pattern, in case of a
coherent superposition, and thus have to be performed
as fast as possible in order to prevent decoherence from
washing-out the interference pattern. With the parame-
ters used, the blurring distance is given by σ4 ≈ 2.4 nm
with the presence of gravitationally-induced decoherence
and σ4 ≈ 1.9 nm with only standard sources of deco-
herence. Note that the diﬀerence is minimal and the
blurring is small enough to not wash-out the interference
fringes generated when gravitationally-induced decoher-
ence is absent, since the fringe separation takes the value
xf ≈ 17.3 nm for the chosen parameters.

A larger mass of the sphere has not been considered
mainly because of two reasons: (i) the magnetic ﬁeld gra-
dients are limited by the fact that the ﬁeld at the surface
of the sphere has to be smaller than the ﬁrst critical ﬁeld
of the superconducting material. The larger the mass,
the smaller the ﬁeld gradients and thus the smaller the
trap frequency in step 1, which then prevents one from
achieving the resolved-sideband regime and thus prepar-
ing a suﬃciently pure initial state. Namely, we require
the initial thermal mean phonon number occupation to
be smaller than 1, and ¯n ≈ 0.07 for our parameter choice.
(ii) The larger the mass, the more is the required vi-
bration isolation in order to ensure that gravitationally-
induced decoherence is the main source of decoherence.
We have already considered a very good isolation vibra-
√
Sxx ∼ 10−16 m/
tion with values of
Hz at frequen-
√
cies below 1 Hz, as required in steps 3, 4, and 7, and
√
Sxx ∼ 10−18 m/
Hz at frequencies of 50 Hz, as re-
quired in steps 2,5 and 6.
In a cryogenic environment
these values are challenging, and comparable to vibra-
tion isolation in present-day gravitational wave detectors.
Nevertheless, we remark that in future cryogenic gravi-
tational wave detectors, schemes for achieving vibration
isolation at the incredible numbers of 10−24 m/
Hz at
low frequencies are being developed, see for instance the
KAGRA project [51].

√

Vibrations are the main source of decoherence in our
model provided that the decoherence from magnetic ﬁeld
ﬂuctuations can be ignored. The latter is the case if the
surface is superconducting, for example, if one uses a su-
perconducting atom chip [52–54]. Note that the sphere
is skating at a distance from the surface of the order of
11 µm. The distance slightly varies in each step of the
protocol, something that we have not optimized since the
smooth transitions between steps have not been included
in our calculations. Should the decoherence from the sur-
face be a hindering factor, one could also consider imple-
menting the interferometer protocol in free fall [3] with
external magnetic potentials speeding-up the dynamics,
as in step 2 and 6 of the protocol.

As mentioned before, we refer to the Appendix for the
complete list of experimental parameters used to analyt-
ically calculate, as an example, the interference pattern

shown in Fig. 5.

VI. CONCLUSIONS & FINAL REMARKS

We have proposed and analyzed a quantum interferom-
eter scheme for preparing and probing quantum superpo-
sitions of a sphere in the micrometer scale with a mass
(cid:38) 1013 amu. The quantum superposition state is pre-
pared by using a Young’s double slit with slit separation
comparable to the radius of the sphere. In particular, we
have proposed an all-magnetic on-chip scheme where a
superconducting microsphere skates in a magnetic land-
scape generated by persistent currents. The chip also
houses some SQUIDs that are used to cool, implement a
double slit, and measure ﬁnal interference fringes. As the
sphere skates through such a magnetic skatepark an all-
magnetic Young’s double slit experiment is implemented
passively, namely without the need to switch on and oﬀ
magnetic potentials and to actively control the quantum
circuits. Using a feasible set of experimental parame-
ters as a case study, we have shown that one can enter
into the gravitational quantum regime where the faint pa-
rameter free gravitationally-induced collapse model, pro-
posed by Diósi and Penrose [6, 7], could be unambigu-
ously falsiﬁed. While we have focused on this paradig-
matic parameter-free collapse model as a ﬁgure of merit,
we remark that our proposal would falsify the continuous-
spontaneous-localization collapse model [55] with a col-
lapse frequency phenomenological parameter as small as
10−22 Hz, several orders of magnitude below the original
value proposed by Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber in the
80’s [56].
In our analysis, especially regarding the ex-
perimental feasibility, we have modelled the experiment
with some necessary degree of simpliﬁcation. For exam-
ple, we have not considered the many potential sources
of noise and decoherence that could be encountered in a
real experimental implementation. Instead, we have an-
alyzed the aspects that we consider unavoidable in any
experimental implementation and that would pose more
than a technological challenge.

We believe that in general, experiments aiming to ex-
plore the quantum superposition principle of very mas-
sive objects would beneﬁt from the conditions that we
have analysed and determined to be crucial for this pro-
posal: (i) a cryogenic environment that minimizes de-
coherence due to black-body radiation and due to scat-
tering of air molecules because of the ultra-high vacuum
present in such environments, (ii) the possibility to use
static ﬁelds (ideally using persistent currents) to generate
inverted potentials that speed-up the otherwise very slow
quantum dynamics, (iii) a very good vibration isolation
to avoid decoherence when using external potentials, (iv)
superconducting surfaces in case of near-surface propos-
als since low frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld ﬂuctuations
are absent, and (v) the use of quantum circuits to cool,
to engineer non-linearities, and to measure the position
of the massive object.

The set of experimental parameters used in the case
study aim at exploring the limits of our proposal. How-
ever, should one use smaller masses, all the limits on the
experimental parameters would loosen, thereby making
the proposal more feasible. Recall that quntum matter-
wave interferometers hold a mass record of 104 amu [5].
Our case study uses a sphere with a mass 9 orders of
magnitude heavier. We also believe that realizing any of
the steps of our proposal would represent an exciting and
original experiment, namely: on-chip magnetic levitation
of a superconducting microsphere, quantum magnetome-
chanical coupling of its center-of-mass to a quantum cir-
cuit, ground state cooling, showing quantum free expan-
sion of its center-of-mass, and the preparation of a non-
Gaussian mechanical state using the non-linear quantum
optomechanical coupling. Moreover, the all-magnetic on-
chip quantum interferometer could also be implemented
and tested with a gas of magnetic ultracold atoms [3, 45].
We remark that one of the main ingredients to per-
form quantum interference of such massive objects in less
than a second is the use of inverted potentials that speed-
up the quantum dynamics. This idea could also be im-
plemented in a free fall experiment that would require
a cryogenic high-vacuum tower of few meters [3]. The
same protocol described here could be implemented in
this scenario. In our protocol we propose to perform the
Young’s double slit by performing a quantum measure-
ment of the squared position. Alternatively, one could
also consider preparing the quantum superposition us-
ing a non-Gaussian (more than quadratic dependence
in position) magnetic potential. Also, one could con-
sider a magnetic grating formed, for instance, using the
ﬁeld created by an array of pinned superconducting vor-
tices or nanomagnets.
If the magnetic lattice has ﬁeld
maxima larger than the critical ﬁeld of the sphere, su-
perconductivity is prevented for spheres passing through
these areas. Such a magnetic grating could be used for
near-ﬁeld matter-wave interferometry, as an all-magnetic
version of the all-optical Talbot-Lau matter-wave inter-
ferometers currently being implemented [57]. In this all-
magnetic scenario, one could again use static ﬁelds to
speed-up the dynamics without creating decoherence and
thus increase the mass of of the particle used in near-ﬁeld
matter-wave interferometers without requiring a space
environment [25, 26]. Our proposal could also be ex-
tended to exploit the other interpretations of the gravita-
tional quantum regime. In particular, one could consider
two cold superconducting spheres moving along parallel
magnetic waveguides and measure the mutual gravita-
tional interaction which can then be used to determine
G. That is a levitation version of a recently proposed
experiment for measuring G with milligram masses [8].
One could also consider entangling the levitated spheres
using the gravitational interaction.

quantum interferometer exploring quantum mechanics in
a hitherto unexplored parameter regime, will trigger fur-

Appendix A: Experimental parameters

In this section we provide a list of experimental pa-
rameters. We emphasize that the choice of parameters
is not optimized, it is simply a representative example.
This set of parameters has been used to plot Fig. 5. We
label the free parameters that we have chosen with the
item symbol ?. The parameters that are not free, either
because they are calculated from the chosen free param-
eters or because they are ﬁxed by the choice (e.g. mass
density once we have chosen the material), are labeled
with the item symbol •.
