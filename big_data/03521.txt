In this paper, we study the cosmic constraint to wCDM model via 118 strong gravitational lensing systems
which are complied from SLACS, BELLS, LSD and SL2S surveys, where the ratio between two angular diam-
eter distances Dobs = DA(zl, zs)/DA(0, zs) is taken as a cosmic observable. To obtain this ratio, we adopt two
strong lensing models: one is the singular isothermal sphere model (SIS), the other one is the power-law density
proﬁle (PLP) model. Via the Markov Chain Mote Carlo method, the posterior distribution of the cosmological
model parameters space is obtained. The results show that the cosmological model parameters are not sensi-
tive to the parameterized forms of the power-law index γ. Furthermore, the PLP model gives a relative tighter
constraint to the cosmological parameters than that of the SIS model. The predicted value of Ωm = 0.31+0.44
−0.24
by SIS model is compatible with that obtained by Planck2015: Ωm = 0.313 ± 0.013. However, the value of
Ωm = 0.15+0.13
−0.11 based on the PLP model is smaller and has 1.25σ tension with that obtained by Planck2015
result. This discrepancy maybe come from the systematic errors.

Introduction

Dark energy is a synonym for a formalism which can de-
scribe the late time accelerated expansion of our Universe
[1, 2]. Up to now, we have already known that a dark energy
has a (eﬀective) negative pressure (or a negative equation of
state) and permeates the whole Universe smoothly, please see
[3] and references therein for reviews. Revealing the proper-
ties of dark energy strongly depends on the cosmic observa-
tions. Since the property of dark energy mainly comes into
the expansion rate of our Universe, i.e.
the Hubble param-
eter H(z), the geometrical measurements from the luminos-
ity distance of type Ia supernovae and the sound horizon of
baryon acoustic oscillations can provide a constraint to the
equation of state of dark energy. In the literature, to grasp the
main properties and to avoid building a concrete dark energy
model, for instance selecting a concrete potential form V(φ)
for a quintessence dark energy model, one chooses a param-
eterized equation of state of dark energy, i.e. p = wρ. This
wCDM model can be taken as the simplest extension to the
ΛCDM model where w = −1 is respected. Now the dark en-
ergy issue is how to determine the values of w at diﬀerent red-
shift z from cosmic observations. Since this simplest param-
eterization of w connects to the cosmic observations through
the Friedmman equation or the Hubble parameter H(z) as a
function of redshift z, the geometric measurements, such as
the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae [1, 2, 4–6], the
position of the peaks of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) radiation [7, 8] and the baryon acoustic oscillations
[9] and gamma-ray bursts [10–14] can constrain the values of
w. Principally, more cosmic observations are needed to get
a tighter constraint to the properties of dark energy, here its
equation of state.

When the light rays pass through astronomical objects
(galaxies, cluster of galaxies), the cosmological gravitation

∗ lxxu@dlut.edu.cn

ﬁeld bends the paths traveled by light from distant source
to us. These light paths respond to the distribution of mass.
Therefore, the positions of the source and the image are re-
lated through the simple lens equation. The information of
the invisible matter can be deduced by making a thorough in-
quiry the relation between sources and images.
If one can
measure the redshifts of the source and lens, the velocity dis-
persion of the mass distribution, the separated image, then
one might be able to infer the distribution of the mass in our
Universe. Since the ﬁrst discovery of the strong gravitational
lensing in Q0957 + 561 by Walsh, Carswell and Weymann
in 1979 [15], it has become a powerful probe in the study of
cosmology. Actually, in the last few years, the strong lens-
ing systems have been used as useful probe to determine the
cosmological model parameter space [17–28, 32–37]. Up to
now, the data points have amounted to 118 as collected in Ref.
[18]. These 118 strong lensing systems are complied from
four surveys: SLACS, BELLS, LSD and SL2S. The Sloan
Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) and the BOSS emission-line lens
survey (BELLS) are spectroscopic lens surveys in which can-
didates are selected respectively from Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey (SDSS) data and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Sur-
vey (BOSS). BOSS has been initiated by upgrading SDSS-I
optical spectrograph [16]. These data points allow us to in-
vestigate the properties of dark energy.

Strong gravitational lensing occurs whenever the source,
the lens and the observer are so well aligned that the observer-
source direction lies inside the so-called Einstein ring of the
lensing. To extract the geometric information from a strong
lensing system, one should specify a lensing model connect-
ing the source, the image. In fact, the geometric information
can be derived is the ratio

Dobs(zl, zs) = DA(zl, zs)/DA(0, zs),

(1)

between two angular diameter distances DA(zl, zs) (the angu-
lar diameter distance between lens and source) and DA(0, zs)
(the angular diameter distance between the observer and the
source) which has been adopted as an observable [17, 19–21].

In theory, this angular diameter distance reads

DA(z1, z2; p) =

c
H0

1 + z2 Z z2

z1

dz′

E(z′; p)

,

(z2 > z1),

(2)

for a spatially ﬂat cosmology, where H0 is the Hubble constant
and E(z; p) is the dimensionless expansion rate which depends
on redshift z and cosmological parameters p. For the wCDM
model considered in this paper, p should be

p = {H0, Ωm, w},

and the dimensionless expansion rate reads

E2(z; p) = Ωm(1 + z)3 + Ωw(1 + z)3(1+w),

(3)

(4)

where Ωm is dimensionless density parameter of matter, and
Ωw = 1 − Ωm is dimensionless density parameter of dark
energy for a spatially ﬂat cosmology.
It is clear that the
Hubble parameter H0 cannot be constrained, once the ratio
Dobs(zl, zs) = DA(zl, zs)/DA(0, zs) is adopted as cosmic ob-
servable. Now we have only two cosmological model param-
eters, Ωm, w remained to be determined by the strong lensing
systems. Of course, the free model parameter would be in-
creased for a speciﬁc lensing model.

Recently, the authors of Ref.

[18] studied the equation
of state of dark energy by using 118 strong lensing systems
under the assumption of power-law density proﬁle. In Ref.
[18], it also claimed that the strong lensing systems cannot
give a tight constraint to the density parameter of dark mat-
ter Ωm due to the possible narrow range of values of the ratio
Dobs(zl, zs) = DA(zl, zs)/DA(0, zs). Therefore, Ωm was ﬁxed
to the best-ﬁt value obtained by Planck2013 in Ref. [18]. It
is clear that the results are limited. Since the number of the
strong lensing systems amounts to 118 which is almost twice
as much as that in before, one would like to see the constrain-
ing power for Ωm. On the other hand, once the power-law
density proﬁle is assumed, one would like to understand the
degeneracy between Ωm and the power law index, and also the
impact on the cosmological parameters due to the evolution of
the power law index. This is the main motivation of this work.
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we simply
introduce strong gravitational lensing models: the SIS model
and power-law density proﬁle model respectively. In Section
III, we will present constraint results to wCDM model using
the SIS model and power-law density proﬁle models by relax-
ing the values of Ωm. We also study the impact on the cos-
mological parameters due to the diﬀerent parameterization of
γ(zl) and its degeneracy to Ωm in this section. Conclusion is
given in Section IV.

II. Lensing Models

To have the ratio of Dobs(zl, zs) = DA(zl, zs)/DA(0, zs) for
a strong lensing system, one needs to specify a lensing model
which relates the Einstein radius to the projected mass density.
In this paper, we will mainly focus on the singular isother-
mal sphere (SIS) or singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) proﬁle

2

[26–28] and a generalized spherically symmetric power-law
mass distribution model ρ ∼ r−γ. The spherically symmet-
ric power-law model was proposed to consider the possible
deviation from the isothermal proﬁle and its evolution with
redshift due to the structure formation theory [29–31]. The
singular isothermal sphere (SIS) is recovered when γ = 2 is
respected. In the following part of this section, we will give a
brief review of these two models.

A. Singular Isothermal Sphere Model

Analysis of isothermal mass properties have been widely
applied in statistical analysis of the lens [26–28]. Under the
ﬁrst order approximation, SIS model is a good choice to ob-
tain mean parameters of galaxies in the statistical analysis.
The Einstein radius in SIS model is given by [20, 32]

θE = 4π

(5)

where σS IS is the velocity dispersion and c is the speed of
light. One introduces the relation between the stellar velocity
dispersion σ0 and the velocity dispersion σS IS in the form of

where fE is a free model parameter. Then if the observed
values of the Einstein radius and the velocity dispersion are
obtained, one has the observed ratio easily

here θE and σ0 are the Einstein radius and the stellar velocity
dispersion respectively; c is the speed of light. According to
[20, 32], the value of fE is in the range 0.81/2 < fE < 1.21/2. In
order to eliminate the eﬀects and uncertainties caused by the
free parameter fE, Wang and one of us proposed to use the ra-
tio Dobs
as cosmic observations to constrain
the cosmological model, where i, j denote the order numbers
In this way, the
of the lensing systems used in Ref.
eﬀects and uncertainties caused by the free parameter fE are
eliminated completely. But in this paper, fE together with the
cosmological model parameters will be treated as a free model
parameters.

[21].

When we obtain the observable Dobs from the observed val-
ues of the Einstein radius θE and the velocity dispersion σ0,
the uncertainties are also introduced into the error budget. Via
the error propagation equation, one can derive the 1σ error for
Dobs

where σθE , σσ0 and σ fE are the uncerteinties of θE, σ0 and fE
respectively. Fortunately, σ0 and σσ0 can be obtained from
observations. Following the SLACS team, we take 5% error
for θE and fE due to the fractional uncertainty of the Einstein
radius at the level of 5%. According to Ref. [40], it can be
seen that choose σθE the level of 5% is reasonable, see also in
Ref. [18].

In this model, the 1σ error of Dobs

PLP comes from the uncertain-

For a general power-law density proﬁle model, the mass
density distribution is given by ρ ∼ r−γ according to Refs.
[18]. Since lensing mass inside the Einstein radius is deter-
mined by θE, for a spherically symmetric lensing system, we
can shift the coordinate origin to the centre of symmetry and
reduce light deﬂection to a one-dimensional problem,

M(ξ) = 2πZ ξ

0

Σ(ξ′)ξ′dξ′,

(9)

where M(ξ) is the mass enclosed within the radius ξ, and Σ(ξ)
is the projected mass density for lensing. For the case of a
Einstein ring, the mass Mlens inside Einstein radius is given
by

Mlens = πΣcrR2
E,

(10)

where RE = θE DA(zl) is the physical Einstein radius, and Σcr
is the critical projected mass density

Σcr =

It was suggested that the mass density power-law index
γ of massive elliptical galaxies evolves with respect to red-
shift [29–31]. And a linear relation with zl was assumed
γ(zl) = 2.12+0.03
−0.12 × zl + 0.17 ± 0.02(scatter) by
combining the lensing sample from SLACS, SL2S and LSD.
Here we just quote the results in the case of wCDM model
obtained in Ref. [18]: γ0 = 2.06 ± 0.09, γ1 = −0.09 ± 0.16
where 118 lensing systems were used under the assumption
of a ﬁxed best-ﬁt value of Ωm obtained by Planck2013. Al-
though, by this assumption, a relative tighter constraint to the
equation of sate of dark energy could be obtained as shown in
Ref. [18], the results and conclusion are limited to the spe-
cial case. More importantly, one would like to see the power
in constraining cosmological model beyond the only equation
of sate of dark energy, say Ωm. Furthermore, we would like
to know the possible degeneracy between Ωm and γ, and the
possible dependence of cosmological model parameter space
on the parameterzied forms of γ. Therefore, in this work, we
choose two parameterized forms of γ:

Model I : γ(zl) = γ0 + γazl,
Model II : γ(zl) = γ0 + γa

zl

1 + zl

(19)

(20)

,

to study the parameterzied form dependence issue, where γ0
and γa are free constant parameters. The Model II is inspired
by the CPL dark energy model which was already taken as
a very nature Taylor expansion at present, i.e. a = 1. As
a comparison to Model I, Model II is not divergent even at
quite large redshift, although the lens distribute at relative low
redshift. To see the constraining power to the cosmological
model and the possible degeneracy between Ωm and γ, we
relax Ωm as a free cosmological parameter.

III. Methodology and Results

To obtain the model parameter space, we perform a global
ﬁtting via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which is
based on the publicly available CosmoMC package [41]. The

posterior likelihood L ∼ exph−χ2(p)/2i is given by calculat-

ing the χ2(p)

A. Constraint Results for the SIS Model

In the SIS model, we have three cosmological model pa-

rameters and one SIS model parameter, i.e.

p = {H0, Ωm, w, fE}.

(23)

Because the ratio DA(z, zs)/DA(0, zs) is taken as observable,
the Hubble parameter H0 cannot be constrained, therefore H0
is marginalized in our analysis in SIS model and power-law
density proﬁle models. The constraint results are shown in
Table I and Figure 1. In 1σ region, one has Ωm = 0.31+0.44
−0.24
which is compatible with that obtained by Planck2015 result:
Ωm = 0.313 ± 0.013 [42]. The value of w = −2.2+1.7
−2.4 in 1σ
region implies that our Universe is undergoing an accelerated
expansion. It conﬁrms the ﬁndings by SN Ia independently.
The value of fE = 0.986+0.047
−0.041 centering around fE ∼ 1 is also
compatible with previous results [20, 32].

B. Constraint Results for the Power-law Density Proﬁle Model

In this model, we also have three cosmological model pa-

rameters and two proﬁle index parameter, i.e.

p = {H0, Ωm, w, γ0, γa}.

(24)

As stated in the previous subsection, H0 is marginalized.
The constraint results are shown in Table II and Figure 2.
As shown in Figure 2, we obtain almost the same distribu-
tion for the cosmological model space, i.e. Ωm = 0.15+0.13
−0.11,
w = −1.25+0.66
−0.86 for the Model I and Ωm = 0.16+0.14
−0.11 and
w = −1.23+0.66
−0.87 for the Model II, although the distribution
for γ parameters are diﬀerent. It means that the cosmological
model parameters, Ωm and w, are not sensitive to the parame-
terization form of γ. And there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence for

the ∆χ2 = 0.7 for two parameterized forms. Therefore, the
cosmological parameter space do not depend on the parame-
terized forms of γ. And in the contour plot for Ωm − γ, there
is no signiﬁcant degeneracy between Ωm and γ. But γ0 and γa
are anti-correlated for centring around γ ∼ 2.
As a comparison to the SIS model, the power-law den-
sity proﬁle model can give a relative tight constraint to the
cosmological model parameters and favors small values of
Ωm. But we should note that the values of Ωm = 0.15+0.13
−0.11
have 1.25σ tension with that obtained by Planck2015 result:
Ωm = 0.313 ± 0.013 [42].

IV. Conclusion

In this paper, we show the constraint to the wCDM model
through 118 strong lensing systems by relaxing Ωm as a free
cosmological parameter which was previously ﬁxed to its

5

isothermal sphere (SIS) model and the power-law density
proﬁle (PLP) model. For PLP model, to study the possi-
ble degeneracy between Ωm and γ, and the possible depen-
dence of cosmological model parameter space on the param-
eterzied forms of γ, we proposed two parameterized forms
for the density power index γ: γ = γ0 + γazl (Model I) and
γ = γ0 + γazl/(1 + zl). Via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method, the posterior distribution of the cosmological param-
eters space and lensing model parameter space are obtained
as shown in Table I and Table II. For the SIS model, one ob-
tains Ωm = 0.31+0.44
−0.24 which is compatible with that obtained
by Planck2015 result: Ωm = 0.313 ± 0.013 [42] but large
1σ error bars. And the values of w = −2.2+1.7
−2.4 in 1σ region
imply that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expan-
sion. It conﬁrms the ﬁndings by SN Ia independently. For
the PLP model, as a comparison to the SIS model, a rela-
tive tight constraint is obtained for the cosmological param-
eter space: Ωm = 0.15+0.13
−0.86. But PLP model
favours small values of Ωm which also has 1.25σ tension with
that of Planck2015 result. We should notice that the system-
atic errors of lensing systems are not included, this discrep-
ancy maybe come from the systematic errors. For this point,
it still under investigation. We do not see any signiﬁcant de-
pendence on the parameterized form of γ for the cosmological
parameter space. But γ0 and γa is anti-correlated for keeping
γ around γ ∼ 2.
