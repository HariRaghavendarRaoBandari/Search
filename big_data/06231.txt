Abstract

We consider a non-standard model of gravity coupled to a neutral scalar “inﬂaton” as well as
to SU (2)× U (1) iso-doublet scalar with positive mass squared and without self-interaction, and
to SU (2) × U (1) gauge ﬁelds. The principal new ingredient is employing two alternative non-
Riemannian space-time volume-forms (covariant integration measure densitities) independent of
the metric. The latter have a remarkable impact – although not introducing any additional prop-
agating degrees of freedom, their dynamics triggers a series of important features: appearance of
inﬁnitely large ﬂat regions of the eﬀective “inﬂaton” potential as well as dynamical generation of
Higgs-like spontaneous symmetry breaking eﬀective potential for the SU (2) × U (1) iso-doublet
scalar.

Introduction

In a remarkable paper from 1986 [1] J. Bekenstein proposed the intriguing idea about a gravity-assisted
spontaneous symmetry breaking of electro-weak (Higgs) type without invoking unnatural (according to
Bekenstein’s opinion) ingredients like negative mass squared and a quartic self-interaction for the Higgs ﬁeld.
By considering a model of gravity interacting with a standard Klein-Gordon ﬁeld (with small positive mass
squared and without self-interaction) coupled conformally to the scalar curvature he managed to obtain
a prototype of dynamically induced Higgs-like spontaneous symmetry breaking scalar potential. Similar
approach was further worked out in [2].

Motivated by Bekenstein’s idea, in the present essay we will consider a non-standard model of gravity
coupled to a neutral scalar “inﬂaton” ϕ as well as to a U (1)-charged SU (2) iso-doublet scalar ﬁeld σ with a
standard positive mass squared and no self-interaction, as well as to SU (2)× U (1) gauge ﬁelds. The essential
non-standard feature of this model is employing non-Riemannian space-time volume forms – alternative
generally covariant integration measure densities deﬁned in terms of auxiliry antisymmetric tensor gauge
ﬁelds independent of the pertinent Riemannian metric1. Although being almost pure-gauge degrees of
freedom (see the remark in Section 2 below), the non-Riemannian space-time volume forms trigger a series

of important features unavailable in ordinary gravity-matter models with the standard Riemannian volume-
form (given by the square-root of the determinant of the Riemannian metric): (i) The “inﬂaton” ϕ developes
a remarkable eﬀective scalar potential in the Einstein frame possessing an inﬁnitely large ﬂat region for large
negative ϕ describing the “early” universe evolution; (ii) In the absence of the SU (2) × U (1) iso-doublet
scalar ﬁeld, the “inﬂaton” eﬀective potential has another inﬁnitely large ﬂat region for large positive ϕ
describing the “late” (post-inﬂationary) universe; (iii) Inclusion of the SU (2) × U (1) iso-doublet scalar ﬁeld
σ introduces a drastic change in the total eﬀective scalar potential in the post-inﬂationary universe – the
eﬀective potential as a function of σ acquires exactly the electro-weak Higgs-type spontaneous symmetry
breaking form.

2 Gravity-Gauge-Field-Matter Model With Two Independent Non-

Riemannian Volume-Forms

Our starting point is the following non-standard gravity-gauge-ﬁeld-matter system with an action of the
general form involving two independent non-Riemannian volume-forms generalizing the model studied in [5]
and whose gauge-ﬁeld-matter part has an internal SU (2) × U (1) gauge symmetry (for simplicity we will use
units where the Newton constant is taken as GNewton = 1/16π):

In (1) and in the sequel the following notations are used:

• Φ1(A) and Φ2(B) are two independent non-Riemannian volume-forms, i.e., alternative generally co-

variant integration measure densities on the underlying space-time manifold:

• R = gµνRµν (Γ) and Rµν(Γ) are the scalar curvature and the Ricci tensor in the ﬁrst-order (Palatini)
νλ is a priori independent of the metric gµν. Λ0 is a small

formalism, where the aﬃne connection Γµ

U (1) iso-doublet scalar ﬁeld with the isospinor index a = +, 0 indicating the corresponding U (1)
charge. The gauge-covariant derivative in (3) acting on the iso-doublet scalar σ reads:

whose presence is crucial for non-triviality of the model.

Remark. The systematic canonical Hamiltonian treatment of (1) and, more generally, of any gravity-
matter models built with non-Riemannian volume-forms [7] shows that the auxiliary 3-index tensor gauge
ﬁelds Aµνκ, Bµνκ, Hµνκ are almost pure-gauge, i.e., they do not introduce any new propagating ﬁeld degrees
of freedom except for few free integration constants in their respective equations of motion (see (14)-(15)
below).

Let us note that the requirement for invariance (with the exception of the mass term V0(σ) of the

iso-doublet σa) under the following global Weyl-scale symmetry:

gµν → λgµν , ϕ → ϕ +

uniquely ﬁxes the structure of the non-Riemannian-measure gravity-gauge-ﬁeld-matter action (1). In par-
ticular, for the same reason we have multiplied by an appropriate exponential factor the “inﬂaton” kinetic
term in L(2) (6).

Following [5] we will now derive the eﬀective Einstein-frame form of the dynamics described by (1).

3 Eﬀective Scalar Potential – Inﬁnitely Large Flat Regions and

Emergent Higgs-like Behavoir

A remarkable feature of the eﬀective Einstein-frame scalar potential (22) is that it possesses an inﬁnitely
large ﬂat region for large negative ϕ and is independent of σ there:

Thus, for large negative values of the “inﬂaton” the eﬀective matter Lagrangian (18) reads:

i.e., the SU (2) × U (1) iso-doublet scalar σ becomes massless.

For large positive values of ϕ we obtain A(ϕ, σ) ≃ A(+) = 1 , B(ϕ) ≃ B(+) = 0, and:

(25)

(27)

(28)

In the case of absent SU (2)×U (1) scalar and gauge ﬁelds, a case already discussed in detail in Ref.[5], the
possesses another
1 (4χ2 M2)−1 and the shape of

purely “inﬂaton” eﬀective potential Ueﬀ(ϕ) = (f1e−αϕ − M1)2(cid:2)4χ2(cid:0)f2e−2αϕ + M2(cid:1)(cid:3)−1
inﬁnitely large ﬂat region for large positive values of ϕ: Ueﬀ (ϕ) ≃ U(+) ≡ M 2
Ueﬀ(ϕ) is depicted in Fig.1.

It was found in Ref.[5] that this eﬀective “inﬂaton” potential with two inﬁnitely large ﬂat regions with
vastly diﬀerent scales upon appropriate choice for the values of the parameters accomodates the description
simultaneously of the “early” universe evolution (the inﬂationary epoch) corresponding to the ﬁrst ﬂat
region for large negative ϕ-values (the left one on Fig.1), as well as the “late” (post-inﬂationary) universe
corresponding to the second ﬂat region for large positive ϕ-values (the right one on Fig.2).

The presence of the SU (2) × U (1) scalar and gauge ﬁelds will not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the inﬂationary
dynamics in the “early” universe (when ϕ runs on the left higher ﬂat region of Ueﬀ (ϕ), Fig.1), and where
the SU (2)× U (1) iso-doublet σ-ﬁeld is massless, see (26))) – this dynamics is governed by the purely kinetic
“k-essence” “inﬂaton” part A(−)X + B(−)X 2 − U(−) of (25).
However, in the post-inﬂationary epoch (when ϕ runs on the right lower ﬂat region of Ueﬀ(ϕ), Fig.1) the
presence of the SU (2)× U (1) iso-doublet σ contributes very signiﬁcantly to the full eﬀective scalar potential
(27), which emerges in an exactly Higgs-like form:

The dependence of the Higgs-like parameters (30) and the Higgs-like v.e.v.

with a small residual cosmological constant Λ0, which is identiﬁed with the current epoch observable cosmo-
logical constant. Let us also note that in the post-inﬂationary epoch according to (28) and (29) the massless
“inﬂaton” ϕ (entering the kinetic term X (19) only) looses all interactions with the SU (2)× U (1) iso-doublet
σ (which has now become the Higgs ﬁeld), thus avoiding undesirable ﬁfth-force problems.
(31) on the integration
constants M1,2 and χ2 explicitly reveals the nature of the Higgs-like spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking
(29) as a dynamically generated phenomenon in the post-inﬂationary epoch.
It is triggered exclusively
through the special non-Riemannian volume-form dynamics in the original gravity-gauge-ﬁeld-matter action
(1) leading to the remarkable two-ﬂat-region shape of the “inﬂaton” eﬀective potential (Fig.1). Let us stress
again that in the “early” universe there is no spontaneous breaking of SU (2) × U (1) gauge symmetry and
the Higgs-like iso-doublet scalar ﬁeld σ is massless there (25)-(26).
In
Ref.[5] it was argued that it is natural to associate M1 ∼ M 4
P l and χ2 ∼ 10−1, where MEW
and MP l are the electroweak and Planck scales, respectively. Then, from (31) we see that it is natural also
to associate the bare mass of the SU (2) × U (1) iso-doublet σ-ﬁeld m0 ∼ MEW , so that we will have for the
Higgs-like v.e.v. |σvac| ∼ MEW conforming to the standard electroweak phenomenology.

We conclude with a note on the plausible numerical values for some of the parameters involved.
