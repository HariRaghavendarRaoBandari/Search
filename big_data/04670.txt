FLEMING-VIOT PROCESSES : TWO EXPLICIT EXAMPLES

BERTRAND CLOEZ AND MARIE-NOÉMIE THAI

ABSTRACT. The purpose of this paper is to extend the investigation of the Fleming-Viot process
in discrete space started in a previous work to two speciﬁc examples. The ﬁrst one corresponds
to a random walk on the complete graph. Due to its geometry, we establish several explicit and
optimal formulas for the Fleming-Viot process (invariant distribution, correlations, spectral gap).
The second example corresponds to a Markov chain in a two state space. In this case, the study of
the Fleming-Viot particle system is reduced to the study of birth and death process with quadratic
rates.

1. INTRODUCTION

In discrete space, the Fleming-Viot particle system has been studied by many authors [2, 3, 4, 12,
17]. Such a system is a mean ﬁeld particle system described in the following way: we consider N
copies of an absorbed Markov chain and, instead of being absorbed, one chain jumps randomly
on the state of another one. It is well known that, when the number of copies tends to inﬁnity,
the empirical measure converges to the law of the initial chain conditioned not to be absorbed, see
for instance [8, 10, 14, 23]. Convergence to equilibrium as time goes to inﬁnity is less known. In
[20, 22], this question is addressed for some models. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are
few results on the expression of the invariant distribution or on the explicit rates of convergence.
This paper is concerned with studying two speciﬁc models for which the invariant distribution is
explicit and extend the investigation started by Cloez and Thai [8].
Let Q = (Qi,j; i, j ∈ F ∗ ∪ {0}) be the transition rates matrix of an irreducible and positive
recurrent continuous time Markov process (Xt)t≥0 on a countable state space F = F ∗ ∪ {0}. We

think of 0 as an absorbing state. Let µ be the initial law of (Xt)t≥0 and let µTt be its law at time
t conditioned on non absorption up to time t. That is deﬁned, for all non-negative function f on
F ∗, by

,

where (Pt)t≥0 is the semigroup associated with the transition matrix Q and we use the convention
f (0) = 0. For every x ∈ F ∗, k ∈ F ∗ and non-negative function f on F ∗, we also set

Ttf (x) = δxTtf and µTt(k) = µTt1{k},

∀t ≥ 0.

A quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) for Q is a probability measure νqs on F ∗ satisfying, for
every t ≥ 0, νqsTt = νqs.
The particle system we are focusing on was initially introduced in [9, 10] for approximating the
conditioned semigroup (Tt)t≥0 and the QSD νqs. It is convenient to think of particles as being
indistinguishable, and to consider the occupation number η with, for k ∈ F ∗ , η(k) = η(N )(k)
representing the number of particles at site k. The conﬁguration (ηt)t≥0 is a Markov process with
state space E = E(N ) deﬁned by

Cloez and Thai show that under some conditions, the particle system converges exponentially fast
to equilibrium for a suitable Wasserstein coupling distance. Let us recall the different distances

|η(j) − η(cid:48)(j)|,

Theorem 1.1 (Theorem 1.1 of [8]). Let λ = inf
i ∈ F ∗, p0(i) = Qi,0. If ρ = λ − (sup(p0) − inf(p0)) then for any processes (ηt)t>0 and (η(cid:48)

In particular, if ρ > 0 then there exists a unique invariant distribution νN satisfying for every
t ≥ 0,

Wd(Law(ηt), νN ) ≤ e−ρtWd(Law(η0), νN ).

This theorem gives the existence and uniqueness of the invariant distribution, but this one is not
explicit. Actually, there are few models for which an explicit formula of the invariant distribution
is given. This observation is one of the motivations of the present paper. So, it is interesting
to consider and study a model satisfying the previous point : the example of random walk on a
complete graph. An interesting point of the complete graph approach is that it permits to reduce
the difﬁculties of the Fleming-Viot to the interaction. Due to its simple geometry, several explicit
formulas are obtained such as the invariant distribution, the correlations and the spectral gap. It
seems to be new in the context of Fleming-Viot particle systems. A second model for which
the invariant distribution is explicit is the two point case, the study of the particle system is then
reduced to a birth and death process with quadratic rates. The bound obtained in Theorem 1.1 is
not optimal. Nevertheless, the coupling introduced in [8] in order to prove Theorem 1.1, permits
us to obtain the spectral gap as rate of convergence. Moreover, we show that the spectral gap of
the Fleming-Viot process is always bounded from below by a positive constant not depending on
the number of particles.

The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 is dedicated to the study of random walk on
the complete graph and Section 3 to that of the two point case.

2. COMPLETE GRAPH DYNAMICS

In all this section, we study the example of a random walk on the complete graph. Let us ﬁx
K ∈ N∗, p > 0 and N ∈ N∗, the dynamics of this example is as follows: we consider a model
with N particles and K +1 vertices 0, 1, . . . , K. The N particles move on the K vertices 1, . . . , K
uniformly at random and jump to 0 with rate p. When a particle reaches the node 0, it jumps in-
stantaneously over another particle chosen uniformly at random. This particle system corresponds
to the model previously cited with parameters

Qi,j =

K

,

∀i, j ∈ F ∗ = {1, . . . , K}, i (cid:54)= j and Qi,0 = p,

∀i ∈ F ∗.

The generator of the associated Fleming-Viot process is then given by

Lf (η) =

η(i)

(f (Ti→jη) − f (η))

(4)

for every function f and η ∈ E.
A process generated by (4) is an instance of inclusion processes studied in [13, 15, 16].
It is
then related to models of heat conduction. One main point of [13, 15] is a criterion ensuring the

existence and reversibility of an invariant distribution for the inclusion processes. In particular,
they give an explicit formula of the invariant distribution of a process generated by (4) and we
give this expression in Subsection 2.3. They also study different scaling limits which seem to be
irrelevant for our problems.
Another application of this example comes from population genetics. Indeed, this model can also
be referred as neutral evolution, see for instance [11, 24]. More precisely, consider N individuals
possessing one type in F ∗ = {1, . . . , K} at time t. Each pair of individuals interacts at rate p.
Upon an interacting event, one individual dies and the other one reproduces. In addition, every
individual changes its type (mutates) at rate 1 and chooses uniformly at random a new type in F ∗.
The measure µN
t gives the proportions of types. The kind of mutation we consider here is often
referred as parent-independent or the house-of-cards model.
In all this section, for any probability measure µ on E, we set in a classical manner Eµ[·] =

Ex[·]µ(dx) and Pµ = Eµ[1·]; similarly Covµ and Varµ are deﬁned with respect to Eµ.

2.1. The associated killed process. We deﬁne the process (Xt)t≥0 by setting

Xt =

if t < τ
if t ≥ τ,

where τ is an exponential variable with mean 1/p and (Zt)t≥0 is the classical complete graph
random walk (i.e. without extinction) on {1, . . . , K}. We have, for any bounded function f,

t ≥ 0, x ∈ F ∗.
The conditional distribution of Xt is simply given by the distribution of Zt :

Ttf (x) = E [f (Xt) | X0 = x, Xt (cid:54)= 0] ,

P(Xt = i | Xt (cid:54)= 0) = P(Zt = i).

The study of (Zt)t≥0 is trivial. Indeed, it converges exponentially fast to the uniform distribution
πK on {1, . . . , K}. We deduce that for all t ≥ 0 and all initial distribution µ,

K(cid:88)

dTV(µTt, πK) =

|Pµ(Xt = i | τ > t) − πK(i)| ≤ e−t.

i=1

Thus in this case, the conditional distribution of X converges exponentially fast to the Yaglom
limit πK.
2.2. Correlations at ﬁxed time. The special form of L, deﬁned at (4), makes the calculation of
the two-particle correlations at ﬁxed time easy.
Theorem 2.1 (Two-particle correlations). For all k, l ∈ {1, . . . , K}, k (cid:54)= l and any probability
measure µ on E, we have for all t ≥ 0

2.3. Properties of the invariant measure. As (ηt)t≥0 is an irreducible Markov chain on a ﬁnite
state space, it is straightforward that it admits a unique invariant measure. In fact, this invariant
distribution is reversible and we know its expression.
Theorem 2.4 (Invariant distribution). The process (ηt)t≥0 admits a unique invariant and re-
versible measure νN , which is deﬁned, for every η ∈ E, by

This result is a slight generalisation of [13, Section 4] and [15, Theorem 2.1].
Proof. A measure ν is reversible if and only if it satisﬁes the following balance equation

(6)

where ξ = Ti→jη and C(η, ξ) = L1ξ(η) = η(i)(K−1 + pη(j)(N − 1)−1).

Remark 2.8 (Proof through coalescence methods). Maybe we can use properties of Kingman’s
coalescent type process (which is a dual process) to recover some of our results (as for instance
the previous correlation estimates). Indeed, after an interacting event, all individuals evolve inde-
pendtly and it is enough to look when the ﬁrst mutation happens (backwards in time) on one of the
genealogical tree branches. Nevertheless, we prefer to use another approach based on Markovian
techniques.
Remark 2.9 (Number of sites). Theorem 2.7 gives the rate of the decay of correlations with
respect to the number of particles, but we also have a rate with respect to the number of sites K.
For instance when p = 1/K and if η is distributed under the invariant measure, then

|CovνN (η(i)/N, η(j)/N )| ∼K

K(K − 1)N

The previous theorem shows that the occupation numbers of two distinct sites become non-
correlated when the number of particles increases. In fact, Theorem 2.7 leads to a propagation
of chaos:

Result [8, Theorem 1.2] and its corollaries states that there exist C, θ > 0 such that

EνN

All constants are explicit and we have θ < 1/2. The last corollary then gives a better bound. To
our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst time that this rate of convergence is obtained for the Fleming-Viot
process in discrete space. With spectral arguments, this type of result was obtained for diffusion
processes in [20]. This bound is achieved because of the absence of bias term. Indeed,

∀k ∈ F ∗, EνN [µN (k)] =

1
K

= πK(k).

The bad term in [8, Theorem 1.2] comes from, with the notations of its proof, the estimation of
|uk(t) − vk(t)| and Gronwall Lemma.
Remark 2.11 (Parameters depending on N). A nice application of explicit rates of convergence is
to consider parameters depending on N. For instance, we can now consider that p = pN depends
on N, this does not change neither the conditioned semi-goup nor the QSD but this changes the
dynamics of our interacting-particle system. The last corollary gives that if
N→∞ pN /N = 0 then
lim
the empirical measure converges to the uniform measure.
2.4. Long time behavior and spectral analysis of the generator. In this subsection, we point
out the optimality of Theorem 1.1 in this special case. Conditions in Theorem 1.1, which seems to
be a bit strong, are tight in the complete graph dynamics. In that case, λ = ρ = 1 and the bound
obtained is optimal in terms of contraction. Moreover, the obtained rate is exactly the spectral gap.
Corollary 2.12 (Wasserstein contraction). For any processes (ηt)t>0 and (η(cid:48)
t)t>0 generated by
(4), and for any t ≥ 0, we have

Wd(Law(ηt), Law(η(cid:48)

In particular, when (η(cid:48)
t ≥ 0

Wd(Law(ηt), νN ) ≤ e−tWd(Law(η0), νN ).

In particular, if λ1 is the smallest positive eigenvalue of −L, deﬁned at (4), then we have

1 = ρ ≤ λ1.

Indeed, on the one hand, let us recall that, as the invariant measure is reversible, λ1 is the largest
constant such that

(7)
for every λ < λ1 and f ∈ L2(νN ), where (Rt)t≥0 is the semi-group generated by L. See for
instance [5, 21]. On the other hand, if λ < 1 then, by Theorem 1.1, we have

L2(νN ) = 0,

t→+∞ e2λt(cid:107)Rtf − νN (f )(cid:107)2

and then (7) holds. Now, the constant functions are trivially eigenvectors of L associated with the
eigenvalue 0, and if, for k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, l ≥ 1 we set ϕ(l)
: η (cid:55)→ η(k)l then the function ϕ(1)

that whether there exists or not a polynomial function ψ(l)
k =

k = 0 since the
polynomial functions are not linearly independent (F is ﬁnite). More generally, for all l1, . . . , lK ∈
{1, . . . , N}, there exists a polynomial Q with K variables, whose degree with respect to the ith

for every function f on NN and x ∈ NN. We can express the spectrum of this generator. Indeed,
let ϕl : x (cid:55)→ xl, for every l ≥ 0. The family (ϕl)0≤l≤N is linearly independent as can be checked
with a Vandermonde determinant. This family generates the L2−space associated to the invariant
measure since this space has a dimension equal to N + 1. Now, similarly to the proof of the
previous lemma, we can prove the existence of N + 1 polynomials, which are eigenvectors and
linearly independent, whose eigenvalues are λ0, λ1, . . . , λN .

3. THE TWO POINT SPACE
In all this section we denote by p0 the function i ∈ F ∗ (cid:55)→ Qi,0.
We consider a Markov chain deﬁned on the states {0, 1, 2} where 0 is the absorbing state. Its
inﬁnitesimal generator G is deﬁned by

and the corresponding eigenvectors are respectively given by

where A = a − b + p0(1) − p0(2). Also set ν = v+/(v+(1) + v+(2)). From these properties, we
deduce that
Lemma 3.1 (Convergence to the QSD). There exists a constant C > 0 such that for every initial
distribution µ, we have

∀t ≥ 0, dTV(µTt, ν) ≤ Ce−(λ+−λ−)t.

Proof. See [18, Theorem 7] and [18, Remark 3].

Note that

(cid:112)

λ+ − λ− =

(a + b)2 + 2(a − b)(p0(1) − p0(2)) + (p0(1) − p0(2))2

and ρ = a + b − (sup(p0) − inf(p0)) deﬁned in Theorem 1.1. We have then λ+ − λ− > ρ when
sup(p0) > inf(p0). In particular Theorem 1.1 seems not optimal.

3.2. Explicit formula of the invariant distribution. Firstly note that, as

∀η ∈ E, η(1) + η(2) = N,

each marginal of (ηt)t≥0 is a Markov process:
Lemma 3.2 (Markovian marginals). The random process (ηt(1))t≥0, which is a marginal of a
process generated by (8), is a Markov process generated by G deﬁned by

Gf (n) = bn(f (n + 1) − f (n)) + dn(f (n − 1) − f (n)),

for any function f and n ∈ NN = {0, . . . , N}, where

Proof. For every η ∈ E, we have η = (η(1), N−η(1)) thus the Markov property and the generator
(cid:3)
are easily deducible from the properties of (ηt)t≥0.
From this result and the already known results on birth and death processes [6, 7], we deduce that
(ηt(1))t≥0 admits an invariant and reversible distribution π given by

π(n) = u0

for every n ∈ NN. This gives

and

Similarly, as ηt(2) = N − ηt(1), the process (ηt(2))t≥0 is a Markov process whose invariant
distribution is also easily calculable. The invariant law of (ηt)t≥0, is then given by

νN ((r1, r2)) = π ({r1}) ,

∀(r1, r2) ∈ E.

Note that if p0 is not constant then we can not ﬁnd a basis of orthogonal polynomials in the L2
space associated to νN . It is then very difﬁcult to express the spectral gap or the decay rate of the
correlations.
3.3. Rate of convergence. Applying Theorem 1.1, in this special case, we ﬁnd:
Corollary 3.3 (Wasserstein contraction). For any processes (ηt)t>0 and (η(cid:48)
and for any t ≥ 0, we have

t)t>0 generated by (8),

Wd(Law(ηt), Law(η(cid:48)

t)) ≤ e−ρtWd(Law(η0), Law(η(cid:48)

0)),

where ρ = a + b− (sup(p0)− inf(p0)). In particular, when (η(cid:48)
νN of (8), we get for every t > 0

0) follows the invariant distribution

Wd(Law(ηt), νN ) ≤ e−ρtWd(Law(η0), νN ).

This result is not optimal. Nevertheless, the error does not come from the coupling choice of [8]
but it comes from how the distance is estimated. Indeed, this coupling induces a coupling between
two processes generated by G deﬁned by (9). More precisely, let L = LQ + Lp be the generator of
the coupling introduced in the proof of [8, Theorem 1.1] in this special case. We set G = GQ +Gp,
where for any n, n(cid:48) ∈ NN and f on E × E,

LQf ((n, N − n), (n(cid:48), N − n(cid:48))) = GQϕf (n, n(cid:48)),
Lpf ((n, N − n), (n(cid:48), N − n(cid:48))) = Gpϕf (n, n(cid:48)),

by

12

BERTRAND CLOEZ AND MARIE-NOÉMIE THAI

and ϕf (n, n(cid:48)) = f ((n, N − n), (n(cid:48), N − n(cid:48))). It satisﬁes, for any function f on NN and n(cid:48) > n
two elements of NN,

for every n, n(cid:48) ∈ NN such that n(cid:48) > n. For all n ∈ NN\{N}, we have Gδu(n, n + 1) ≤
−λuδu(n, n + 1) where

λu =

and thus, by linearity, Gδu(n, n(cid:48)) ≤ −λuδu(n, n(cid:48)), for every n, n(cid:48) ∈ NN. This implies that for
any processes (Xt)t≥0 and (X(cid:48)

Wδu(Law(Xt), Law(X(cid:48)
Note that, for every n, n(cid:48) ∈ NN, we have

min(u)d((n, N − n), (n(cid:48), N − n(cid:48))) ≤ δu(n, n(cid:48)) ≤ max(u)d((n, N − n), (n(cid:48), N − n(cid:48))),
t)t≥0 generated by (8), and for any t ≥ 0, we have

and then for any processes (ηt)t≥0 and (η(cid:48)

Wd(Law(ηt), Law(η(cid:48)

t)) ≤ max(u)
min(u)

e−λutWd(Law(η0), Law(η(cid:48)

Finally, using [7, Theorem 9.25], there exists a positive sequence v such that λv = max
λu > 0 is
the spectral gap of the birth and death process (ηt(1))t≥0. These parameters depend on N and so
we should write the previous inequality as

Wd(Law(ηt), Law(η(cid:48)

(10)
where C(N ) and λN are two constants depending on N. In conclusion, the coupling introduced
in Theorem 1.1 gives the optimal rate of convergence but we are not able to express a precise
expression of λN and C(N ). Nevertheless, in the section that follows, we will prove that, whatever

the value of the parameters, the spectral gap is always bounded from below by a positive constant
not depending on N.
3.4. A lower bound for the spectral gap. In this subsection, we study the evolution of (λN )N≥0.
Calculating λN for small value of N (it is the eigenvalue of a small matrix) and some different
parameters show that, in general, this sequence is not monotone and seems to converge to λ+−λ−.
We are not able to prove this, but as it is trivial that for all N ≥ 0, λN > 0, we can hope that it is
bounded from below. The aim of this section is to prove this fact.
Firstly, using similar arguments of subsection 2.4, we have λN ≥ ρ, for every N ≥ 0. This result
does not give us information in the case ρ ≤ 0. However, we can use Hardy’s inequalities [1,
Chapter 6] and mimic some arguments of [19] to obtain:
Theorem 3.4 (A lower bound for the spectral gap). If ρ ≤ 0 then there exists c > 0 such that

∀N ≥ 0, λN > c.

The rest of this subsection aims to prove this result. Hardy’s inequalities are mainly based on the
estimation of the quantities BN,+ and BN,− deﬁned for every i ∈ N by

 x(cid:88)
(cid:32) i−1(cid:88)

BN,+(i) = max

and

BN,−(i) = max
x<i

π(y)by

y=x

We recall that π = πN is the invariant distribution deﬁned in Subsection 3.2 and jumps rates b and
d also depend on N.
More precisely, [19, Proposition 3] shows that if one wants to get a "good" lower bound of the
spectral gap, one only needs to guess an "adequate choice" of i and to apply the estimate

λN ≥

1

4 max{BN,+(i), BN,−(i)} .

So, we have to ﬁnd an upper bound for these two quantities. Before to give it, let us prove that the
invariant distribution π is unimodal. Indeed, it will help us to choose an appropriate i.
Lemma 3.5 (Unimodality of π). The sequence (π(i + 1)/π(i))i≥0 is decreasing.
Proof of Lemma 3.5. For all i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, we set

g(i) =

π(i + 1)

π(i)

=

(N − i)(b(N − 1) + ip0(2))

(i + 1)((a + p0(1))(N − 1) − ip0(1))

.

It follows that

g(i + 1) − g(i) =

(i + 1)((a + p0(1))(N − 1) − ip0(1))(i + 2)((a + p0(1))(N − 1) − (i + 1)p0(1))

ΛN (i)

where

≤ 0.

ΛN (i) = (N − i − 1)(b(N − 1) + (i + 1)p0(2))(i + 1)((a + p0(1))(N − 1) − ip0(1))
− (N − i)(b(N − 1) + ip0(2))(i + 2)((a + p0(1))(N − 1) − (i + 1)p0(1))

= − [b(N − 1) − p0(2)] [(N + 1) (a(N − 1) − p0(1)) + p0(1)(N − i)(N − i − 1)]

− p0(2)(cid:0)i2 + 3i + 2(cid:1) (a(N − 1) − p0(1))

We deduce the result.

BERTRAND CLOEZ AND MARIE-NOÉMIE THAI

Proof of Theorem 3.4. Without less of generality, we assume that p0(1) ≥ p0(2) and we recall
that ρ ≤ 0. We would like to know where π reaches its maximum i∗ since it will be a good
candidate to estimate BN,+(i∗) and BN,−(i∗). From the previous lemma, to ﬁnd it, we look when
π(i + 1)/π(i) is close to one. We have, for all i ∈ {1, . . . , N},

In particular, 1 ≤ i1 ≤ N ≤ i2. Furthermore, if (cid:98).(cid:99) denotes the integer part then

π((cid:98)i1(cid:99) + 2)
π((cid:98)i1(cid:99) + 1)
Let us deﬁne mN = (cid:98)i1(cid:99) + 1 and lN = 2((cid:98)√

Using Lemma 3.5 and the previous calculus, we have that the sequences (π(i))i≥mN and (π(i +

Now using (12) and some equivalents, there exists a constant δ1 > 0 (not depending on N) such
that

.

Using the fact that 1 − x ≤ e−x for all x ≥ 0, we ﬁnally obtain π(mN + lN )/π(mN ) ≤ e−δ1.
Similar arguments entail the existence of δ2 > 0 (also not depending on N) such that π(mN −
lN )/π(mN ) ≤ e−δ2. In conclusion, using Lemma 3.5, we have shown that for all i ≥ mN and
j ≤ mN , the following inequalities holds:

π(i + lN ) ≤ e−δ1π(i) and π(j − lN ) ≤ e−δ2π(j).

We are now armed to evaluate BN,+(mN ) deﬁned in (11). Firstly, using the expressions of the
death rate d and mN , there exist γ > 0 (not depending on N) and N0 ≥ 0 such that for all N ≥ N0
and all i ≥ mN + 1, di ≥ γN. Let us ﬁx x ≥ mN + 1, using that (π(i))i≥mN is decreasing, we

3.5. Simulation and evolution of the spectral gap (of the Fleming-Viot process). As stated in
Lemma 3.1, the rate of convergence λ of the conditioned semi-group to the QSD is explicit. For a
ﬁxed N ≥ 1, the Fleming-Viot process is a reversible Markov chain (for this example) on a ﬁnite
space, it then converges to equilibrium at rate λN , where λN is the eigenvalue of its generator
closer to 0.
Theorem 3.4 shows that the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the Fleming-Viot process is
uniformly bounded. Nevertheless, there is some natural questions such as the convergence of λN
to λ or the monotonicity of this sequence. Also, do we have λN ≤ λ or λN ≥ λ?
When there are few particles, the generator of the Fleming-Viot process is a square matrix of size
2N and one can explicitly calculate its spectrum (with the help of a computer). In ﬁgure 1, each
graphic represents, with different parameters, the evolution of the spectral gap of the conditioned
process λ = λ+ − λ− (detailed in Lemma 3.1), of the Fleming Viot particle system λN and of the
upper-bound ρ in Theorem 1.1, with respect to the number of particles N.
Graphics (i) and (ii) illustrate that when osc(p0) = p0(2) − p0(1) remains constant for two
parameter choices then the Fleming-Viot dynamics are different although the conditioned semi-
groups are the same. More p0(1) is large more jumps there are; these graphics seem to show
that the rate of convergence is dragged down by the interactions. Graphic (iii) shows that λN is
neither increasing nor decreasing and neither upper nor lower than λ. Graphic (iv) shows that
when osc(p0) is small then all curves are close.
In any case, it seems that λN converges to λ but this point remains an open question.

3.6. Correlations. Using [8, Theorem 2.6], we have
Corollary 3.6 (Correlations). If (ηt)t≥0 is a process generated by (8) then we have for all t ≥ 0,

If ρ ≤ 0, the right-hand side of the previous inequality explodes as t tends to inﬁnity whereas
these correlations are bounded by 1. Nevertheless, using Theorem [8, Theorem 2.6], Remark [8,
Remark 2.7] and Inequality (10), we can prove that there exists two constants C(cid:48)(N ), depending
on N, and K, which does not depend on N, such that

Cov(ηt(k)/N, ηt(l)/N ) ≤ C(cid:48)(N ) =

where C(N ) is deﬁned in (10). Even if Theorem 3.4 gives an estimate of λN , C(N ) is not
(completely) explicit and we do not know if the right-hand side of the previous expression tends
to 0 as N tends to inﬁnity. This example shows the difﬁculty of ﬁnding explicit and optimal rates
of the convergence towards equilibrium and the decay of correlations.
