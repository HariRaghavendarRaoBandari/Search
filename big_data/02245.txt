Abstract

New goodness-of-ﬁt tests for exponentiality based on a particular property of

exponential law are constructed. Test statistics are functionals of U -empirical pro-

cesses. The ﬁrst of these statistics is of integral type, the second one is a Kolmogorov

type statistic. We show that the kernels corresponding to our statistics are non-

degenerate. The limiting distributions and large deviations of new statistics under

the null hypothesis are described. Their local Bahadur eﬃciency for various para-

metric alternatives is calculated and is compared with simulated powers of new tests.

Conditions of local optimality of new statistics in Bahadur sense are discussed and

examples of ”most favorable” alternatives are given. New tests are applied to reject

the hypothesis of exponentiality for the length of reigns of Roman emperors which

was intensively discussed in recent years.

Keywords: testing of exponentiality, large deviations, U-statistics, Bahadur eﬃciency.

Introduction

The general problem of exponentiality testing is stated as follows. Let X1, . . . , Xn be
nonnegative independent observations having a continuous distribution function (df) F
and a density f. We wish to test the composite null-hypothesis H0 : F (x) is a df of an
exponential law with density f (x) = λe−λx, x ≥ 0, where λ > 0 is an unknown scale
parameter, against the following alternative: F is a df of a nonexponential law.

There exist numerous tests of exponentiality based on various ideas [2], [4], [6], [8], [13],
[29]. Among them a good few tests are based on characterizations. This is a relatively

fresh idea which manifests growing popularity in goodness-of-ﬁt testing, and in particular,
in exponentiality testing, see, e.g., [3], [7], [12], [16], [18], [27], [31], [37], [40], [42].

Recently Noughabi and Arghami proved and used in [40, Theor.1] the following ”char-

acterization” of exponential law for testing of exponentiality:

Let X1, X2 be two independent identically distributed nonnegative rv’s having a con-
tinuous df F. Then Y = X1/X2 has the df F(2,2) if and only if F is exponential. Here
F(2,2) is the df of Fisher distribution with 2 and 2 degrees of freedom so that

F(2,2)(y) =

y

1 + y

, y ≥ 0.

In fact this property is not the proper characterization of exponential law. This is
known since the paper of Kotlarski [23] which was preceded by the work of Mauldon [26].
In particular, Kotlarski gave three examples of non-exponential densities for X1 and X2
under which the distribution of Y is still F2,2. These three densities are

λx−2 exp(−λx−1)1{x > 0},

(1 + x2)− 3

2 1{x > 0},

and x(1 + x2)− 3

2 1{x > 0}.

Presumably Noughabi and Arghami got the erroneous result because of inaccurate appli-
cation of the characterization result of Kotz and Steutel [24]. The same concerns item iii)
of their Theorem 1 in [40].

However, one can build the statistical tests based on properties of distributions which
are not the proper characterizations as well. Of course, this will lead to inconsistency of
such tests against certain alternatives. But many famous tests well known in statistical
practice are inconsistent against certain special alternatives, for instance, the chi-square
test, the Wilcoxon test (and many other rank tests), the Gini test, and even the likelihood
ratio test.

Moreover, according to the usual concepts of testing statistical hypotheses, the evi-
dence can be suﬃcient only for the rejection of the null-hypothesis H0. On the contrary, its
deﬁnitive acceptance is hardly possible but any new test ”failing to reject” H0 gradually
brings the statistician to the perception of the validity of H0.

The aim of the present paper is to test the hypothesis H0 using the same property of
exponential law as used in [40] and formulated above. We will construct two test statistics
which turn out to be quite sensitive and eﬃcient. We justify it by calculation of their
local Bahadur eﬃciency against common alternatives and by simulation of their power.

Consider instead of the standard empirical df

Fn(t) = n−1

n

Xi=1

1{Xi < t}, t ≥ 0,

2

the U-empirical df

Hn(t) =

1

n(n − 1) X1≤i<j≤n(cid:18)1(cid:26) Xi

Xj

< t(cid:27) + 1(cid:26) Xj

Xi

< t(cid:27)(cid:19) .

It is known that the properties of U-empirical df’s are similar to the properties of
usual empirical df’s, see [11], [15]. Hence for large n and under H0 the df Hn should be
close to Fisher’s df F(2,2), and we can measure their closeness using some test statistics.

We suggest two scale-invariant statistics

Wn =Z ∞
0 (cid:18) t
t≥0 |
Dn = sup

1 + t − Hn(t)(cid:19) µe−µtdt, µ > 0,
t
1 + t − Hn(t) |,

(1)

(2)

assuming that their large absolute values are critical. We have inserted the exponential
weight with some indeﬁnite value of µ > 0 under the sign of integral in order to guarantee
its convergence but for brevity we omit µ in the notation of statistic.

We discuss the limiting distributions of these statistics under the null hypothesis and
calculate their eﬃciencies against common alternatives. We use the notion of local exact
Bahadur eﬃciency (BE) [5], [30], as the statistic Dn has the nonnormal limiting distri-
bution, and hence the Pitman approach to the calculation of eﬃciency is not applicable.
However, it is known that the local BE and the limiting Pitman eﬃciency usually coincide,
see [43], [30].

The large deviation asymptotics is the key tool for the evaluation of the exact BE,
and we address this question using the results of [34] and [32]. Finally, we study the
conditions of local optimality of our tests and describe the ”most favorable” alternatives
for them.

We present the simulated powers of new tests and enlarge the paper by the example
of application to real data. Namely, as an application of new exponentiality tests, we
examine the interesting question on the durations of reigns for Roman emperors discussed
by Khmaladze and his coauthors [19], [20]. Our tests ﬁrmly reject the hypothesis of
exponentiality, and this contradicts the ﬁndings of Khmaladze and his team, see also [9]
and [38].

We stress that usually in the papers on testing based on characterizations one uses

the equality in distribution of two statistics T1 and T2:

T1(X1, . . . , Xk) d= T2(X1, . . . , Xm)

which characterizes the family of distributions or some speciﬁc property, e.g., symmetry
of distribution. But in our paper we use a diﬀerent relation when a certain statistic has

3

the prescribed distribution, and this characterizes or strongly restraints the distribution of
the sample. It seems probable that other tests of ﬁt can be build on the ground of this
apparently new approach.

Integral statistic Wn.

2.1 Limiting properties of statistic Wn.

The statistic Wn is exactly the U-statistic of degree 2 with the centered kernel

where

Φ(X, Y ) = 1 − µeµE1(µ) −
E1(µ) = Ei(1, µ) =Z ∞

is the exponential integral, see [1, Ch.5].

Let X, Y be independent rv’s from the standard exponential distribution. To prove
that the kernel Φ(X, Y ) is non-degenerate, let us calculate its projection ϕµ(s). For a ﬁxed
X = s, s ≥ 0 we have:

ϕµ(s) := E(Φ(X, Y ) | X = s) = 1 − µeµE1(µ) −

Ee−µ s

Y −

Ee−µ Y
s .

After some computations we ﬁnd that the projection ϕµ(s) is equal to

ϕµ(s) = 1 − µeµE1(µ) − √µs K1(2√µs) −

s

2(µ + s)

.

where K1(y) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind.

The mean of this projection is equal to zero. Its variance under H0 and for arbitrary
µ(X), it is positive and can be obtained using numerical

value of µ > 0 equals ∆2
methods (see Fig. 1), according to the formula

W (µ) = Eϕ2

∆2

W (µ) =Z ∞

0

ϕ2
µ(s)e−sds.

Therefore the kernel Φ is centered and non-degenerate. We can apply Hoeﬀding’s
theorem on asymptotic normality of U-statistics, see [14], [22], which implies the following
result:

Theorem 1. Under null hypothesis as n → ∞ the statistic √nWn is asymptotically

normal so that

√nWn

d−→ N (0, 4∆2

W (µ)).

4

W (µ).

The (logarithmic) large deviation asymptotics of the sequence of statistics Wn under
H0 follows from the following result. It was derived using the theorem on large deviations
(see again [34], [32]), applied to the centered, bounded and non-degenerate kernel Φ.

Theorem 2. For a > 0 under H0 one has

lim
n→∞

n−1 ln P(Wn > a) = −fW (a),

where the function fW is continuous for suﬃciently small a > 0, and

fW (a) =

a2

W (µ)

(1 + o(1)), as a → 0.

2.2 Some notions from Bahadur theory

Suppose that under the alternative H1 the observations have the df G(·, θ) and the density
g(·, θ), θ ≥ 0, such that G(·, 0) is the exponential df with some scale parameter. The
measure of Bahadur eﬃciency (BE) for any sequence {Tn} of test statistics is the exact
slope cT (θ) describing the rate of exponential decrease for the attained level under the
alternative df G(·, θ). According to Bahadur theory [5], [30] the exact slopes may be found
by using the following Proposition.
Proposition. Suppose that two following conditions hold:

a)

Tn

where −∞ < b(θ) < ∞, and
lim
n→∞

b)

θ > 0,

Pθ−→ b(θ),
Pθ−→ denotes convergence in probability under G(· ; θ);
n−1 ln PH0 (Tn ≥ t ) = −fT (t)

KLj(θ) = inf

ln(cid:2)gj(x, θ)/λ exp(−λx)(cid:3)gj(x, θ) dx.

0

(4)

for any t in an open interval I, on which fT is continuous and {b(θ), θ > 0} ⊂ I. Then

cT (θ) = 2 fT (b(θ)).

We have already found the large deviation asymptotics necessary for b). In order to
evaluate the exact slope it remains to verify the condition a) of this Proposition which
represents some form of the Law of Large Numbers under the alternative.
Note that the exact slopes for any θ satisfy the inequality (see [5], [30])

cT (θ) ≤ 2KL(θ),

(3)

where KL(θ) is the Kullback-Leibler ”distance” between the alternative and the null-
hypothesis H0. In our case H0 is composite, hence for any alternative density gj(x, θ) one
has

This quantity can be easily calculated as θ → 0 for particular alternatives. According to
(3), the local BE of the sequence of statistics Tn is deﬁned as

eB(T ) = lim
θ→0

cT (θ)

2KL(θ)

.

2.3 Local Bahadur eﬃciency of Wn.

Notation 1. Denote by G the class of densities g(· , θ) with the df ’s G(· , θ), θ ≥ 0, which
satisfy the regularity conditions from [30, Ch.6] with possibility to diﬀerentiate with respect
to θ under the integral sign in all appearing integrals.

We present the following alternatives against exponentiality which will be considered

for both tests in this paper:

i) Weibull distribution with the density

g1(x, θ) = (1 + θ)xθ exp(−x1+θ), θ ≥ 0, x ≥ 0;

ii) Gamma distribution with the density

g2(x, θ) =

xθ

Γ(θ + 1)

e−x, θ ≥ 0, x ≥ 0;

6

iii) exponential mixture with negative weights (EMNW(β)) (see [17])

g3(x) = (1 + θ)e−x − θβe−βx, θ ∈h0,

1

β − 1i, β > 1, x ≥ 0;

iv) exponential distribution with the resilience parameter, or the Verhulst distribution

(see [25, p.333]) with the density

g4(x, θ) = (1 + θ) exp(−x)(1 − exp(−x))θ, θ ≥ 0, x ≥ 0.

From (4) one can ﬁnd the Kullback-Leibler ”distance” for each alternative as θ → 0:

KL1(θ) ∼

θ2; KL4(θ) ∼(cid:18)π2

72(cid:19) θ2.

(5)

For statistic Wn we can derive the following asymptotics as θ → 0 from [33].

Lemma 1. For a given alternative density g(x, θ) from the class G (see Notation 1) under
condition R ∞

0

ϕµ(x)h(x)dx, where h(x) = g′

θ(x, 0).

|g′′
θθ(x, 0)|dx < ∞ we get
bW (θ) ∼ 2θZ ∞

0

We take µ = 2 for deﬁniteness in the exponential weight µe−µt, so for this case the
variance is ∆2
W (2) = 0.0028. Using (2.3) we gather in Table 1 the values of function
bW (θ), local exact slopes as θ → 0 and local BE for statistics Wn. In the case of the third
alternative EMNW we take the value β = 3 as in the recent paper [27]. All this was
obtained using the MAPLE package. We observe here remarkably high values of local BE

Note that there is no theoretical reasons for closeness of local eﬃciencies to the powers.
However, if we take, for instance, the ”realistic” values θ = 0.5 and α = 0.05, then the
ordering of tests is similar under both criteria. At the same time, the local BE under
Weibull and Gamma alternatives has been calculated for many tests of exponentiality,
see, e.g., [31], [35], [37], [38], [39], [36], [27]. It can be supposed that our test statistic Wn
is probably more eﬃcient than the tests considered in these papers. So we may hope that
the new test based on Wn is able to reject the exponentiality hypothesis when the other
tests are unﬁt for it. See section 4 below for partial conﬁrmation of this.

3 Kolmogorov-type statistic Dn

Now we consider the Kolmogorov type statistic (2). For ﬁxed t the diﬀerence t
is a family of U-statistics with the kernel Ξ depending on t ≥ 0 :
Xj
Xi

t
1 + t −

Ξ(Xi, Xj; t) =

< t} −

< t}.

Xi
Xj

Let X, Y be independent rv’s with standard exponential distribution. The projection

of this kernel ξ(s; t) for ﬁxed t ≥ 0 has the form:
t
1 + t −

ξ(s; t) := E(Ξ(X, Y ; t) | X = s) =

1

P(

< t) −

P(

After simple calculations we get the expression for the family of projections:

It is easy to see that E(ξ(X; t)) = 0. The variance of this projection δ2(t) = Eξ2(X; t)

under H0 is given by

Hence,

δ2(t) =

t(t − 1)2(t2 + 3t + 1)

4(t + 1)2(t + 2)(t3 + (t + 1)3)

.

δ2 = sup
t≥0

δ2(t) ≈ 0.00954.

This value will be important in the sequel when calculating the large deviation asymp-
totics.

Figure 2: Plot of the function δ2(t)

The limiting distribution of the statistic Dn is unknown. Using the methods of [41],

one can show that the U-empirical process

ηn(t) = √n(cid:18) t

1 + t − Hn(t)(cid:19) , t ≥ 0,

weakly converges in D(0,∞) as n → ∞ to certain centered Gaussian process η(t) with
calculable covariance. Then the sequence of statistics √nDn converges in distribution
to supt≥0 |η(t)|. Currently we are not able to ﬁnd explicitly its distribution. Hence it is
reasonable to determine the critical values for statistics Dn by simulation.

Table 3 shows the critical values of the null distribution of Dn for signiﬁcance levels
α = 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 and speciﬁc sample sizes n. Each entry is obtained by using the Monte-
Carlo simulation methods with 10,000 replications.

Now we obtain the logarithmic large deviation asymptotics of the sequence of statis-
tics Dn under H0. The family of kernels {Ξ(X, Y ; t), t ≥ 0} is not only centered but also

erate U-statistics, we obtain the following result.

Theorem 3. For a > 0 under H0

n→∞

n−1 ln P(Dn > a) = −fD(a),

where the function fD is continuous for suﬃciently small a > 0, moreover

fD(a) =

8δ2 (1 + o(1)) ∼ 13.103a2, as a → 0.

3.1 Local Bahadur eﬃciency of Dn

Lemma 2. For a given alternative density g(x, θ) from the class G (see Notation 1) we
have

bD(t, θ) ∼ 2θZ ∞

0

ξ(x; t)h(x)dx, where h(x) = g′

θ(x, 0).

Proof. By the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem for U-statistics [15] the limit in probability under
the alternative for statistics Dn is equal to

bD(t, θ) =

t
1 + t − Pθ(

X
Y

< t).

Then as θ → 0

t

bD(t, θ) =

g(y, θ)dyZ yt
It is easily seen that for f (x) = e−x, x ≥ 0,

1 + t −Z ∞

Changing the order of integration in the second integral we see that:

f (y)dy = −Z ∞

Therefore

We cannot ﬁnd the explicit formula for b4

D(t, θ), and are forced to evaluate the maximal

D(θ) by using the numerical methods with MAPLE package. Again using
(5) we present in Table 4 the values of exact slopes when θ → 0 and the local Bahadur
eﬃciencies against our four alternatives for statistics Dn.

We see that the eﬃciency is reasonably high in all four examples. Moreover, it is
much higher than usual values of eﬃciency for Kolmogorov test. In Table 5 we present
the simulated powers for our four alternatives. Again the simulations have been performed
for n = 100 with 10,000 replicates.

4 Application to real data

In this section we apply our tests to an interesting real data example. We examine the
data on the lengths of rule for Western Roman Emperors by chronology of Kienast [21]
as the most precise. We consider two periods of this chronology: the period historians
call ”decline and fall”, taken conditionally from Nerva (reign: 96 - 98 AD) to Theodosius
I (reign: 379 - 395 AD) with n = 53 and full period in data extending back to the ﬁrst
Roman Emperor, Augustus (reign: 27 BC - 14 AD), to Theodosius I with n = 76. The
chronology shows the dates of ascent and abdication (or death). In the cases where exist
no speciﬁc day of month we select a mid-points as it was done in [20] and [19].

In these papers the authors came to the surprising agreement of data with the expo-
nential distribution. However, they used only one test for exponentiality of Kolmogorov
type proposed by Haywood and Khmaladze [10], [19], [20]. This test is probably not sen-
sitive enough, and the single agreement with the exponentiality stated by these authors
does not convince us in the validity of H0. First evidence that exponentiality fails for this
data appeared in [38].

It is interesting to apply our new tests of exponentiality to this challenging problem.

12

We were based on 10,000 simulations of exponential data and calculated the p-values
of new statistics Wn with µ = 2 and Dn understanding them as the probability, under
the assumption of exponentiality hypothesis H0, of obtaining a result equal to or more
extreme than what was actually observed when calculating the test statistics. We got
that for n = 76 all p-values are less than 10−4, and in case of n = 53 we got the following
p-values:

n = 53

n = 76

test
value
p-value

|Wn|, µ = 2

0.048
0.0011

Dn
0.095
0.0019

|Wn|, µ = 2

0.050
< 10−4

Dn
0.096
< 10−4

The smaller is the p-value, the more compelling is the evidence that the alternative should
be accepted. Therefore we conclude that all our tests strongly reject the exponentiality
of this data with the attained signiﬁcance level less than α = 0.002.

In the recent paper by El-Barmi and McKeague [9] the authors used for the sample
of durations of reigns of Roman Emperors their new test on the ordering of distributions
of several independent samples. Let say that the rv X1 with df F1 is stochastically larger
than the rv X2 with df F2, if F1(x) ≥ F2(x) for all x. It is denoted as F1 ≻ F2. The
authors of [9] supposed that the three periods of history of Roman Empire which usually
are called the Principate (27 BC - 235 AD), the Crisis of III century (235 AD - 284
AD) and the Dominate(285 AD - 395 AD) consists of independent but non-identically
distributed periods of reign with df’s F1, F2 and F3, which are probably non-exponential.
Actually their test witnesses in favor of the hypothesis: Dominate ≻ Principate ≻ Crisis,
or equivalently F3 ≻ F1 ≻ F2 and most probably does not support the hypothesis of
exponentiality, too.

We tried also other tests of exponentiality. The hypothesis is steadily rejected for the
full sample of 76 Emperors in virtue of the Moran [28], chi-square, Gini and Lilliefors [36]
tests. In the case of smaller sample n = 53, which corresponds to the ”decline and fall,” of
the Roman Empire, the agreement with exponentiality appears more often. However, the
Moran test still rejects the exponentiality, and our two tests proposed above also append
their contribution to rejection of the hypothesis under discussion.

5 Conditions of local asymptotic optimality

In this section we are interested in conditions of local asymptotic optimality (LAO) in
Bahadur sense for both sequences of statistics Wn and Dn. This means to describe the
local structure of the alternatives for which the given statistic has maximal potential local

13

eﬃciency so that the relation

cT (θ) ∼ 2KL(θ), as θ → 0,

holds (see [5], [30], [35], [33]). Such alternatives form the so-called domain of LAO for the
given sequence of statistics {Tn}.

Let again consider the densities g(· , θ) with the df’s G(· , θ) from the class G (see

Notation 1) . Deﬁne the functions

H(x) =

∂θ

G(x, θ) |θ=0,

h(x) =

6 Conclusion

We have proposed in this paper two new tests of exponentiality which use a particular
property of the exponential law but are not consistent against any alternative. In the
same time they are rather sensitive against the deviations from exponentiality. This is
sustained by their high local Bahadur eﬃciency and considerable power under common
alternatives. Our tests were able to reject the exponentiality of the sample of reigns of
Roman emperors which was claimed by Khmaladze and his coauthors in [10], [19], [20].
We hope that our tests will be useful in other delicate cases when one has to conﬁrm the
rejection of exponentiality hypothesis. Finally we have described the structure of ”most
favorable” alternatives to exponentiality under which our tests become locally optimal in
Bahadur sense.
