BLOCKS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS, SEMICUSPIDAL KLR

ALGEBRAS AND ZIGZAG SCHUR-WEYL DUALITY

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

Abstract. We prove Turner’s conjecture, which describes the blocks of the
Hecke algebras of the symmetric groups up to derived equivalence as certain
explicit Turner double algebras. Turner doubles are Schur-algebra-like ‘local’
objects, which replace wreath products of Brauer tree algebras in the context
of the Brou´e abelian defect group conjecture for blocks of symmetric groups
with non-abelian defect groups. The main tools used in the proof are general-
ized Schur algebras corresponding to wreath products of zigzag algebras and
imaginary semicuspidal quotients of aﬃne KLR algebras.

1. Introduction

Let Hn(q) be the Hecke algebra of the symmetric groups Sn over a ﬁeld F
with parameter q ∈ F×. An important special case is q = 1, when Hn(q) = FSn.
Let e be the quantum characteristic of q. In this paper we assume that e > 0,
i.e. there exists k ∈ Z>0 such that 1 + q + · · · + qk−1 = 0, and e is the smallest
such k.

Representations of Hn(q) for all n ≥ 0 categorify the basic module V (Λ0) with

highest weight Λ0 of the aﬃne Kac-Moody Lie algebra g =bsle(C), see for example

[A1,A2,Gro,K1]. In particular, each weight space V (Λ0)Λ0−α for α in the positive
part of the root lattice is identiﬁed with the complexiﬁed Grothendieck group of
the corresponding block Hα(q) of some Hn(q).

The Weyl group W of g acts on the weights of V (Λ0), and the orbits are
precisely Od := W (Λ0 − dδ) = W Λ0 − dδ for all d ∈ Z≥0, where δ is the null-
root. Chuang and Rouquier [CR] lift this action of W on the weights to derived
equivalences between the corresponding blocks. Therefore, all blocks Hα(q) with
Λ0 − α ∈ Od for a ﬁxed d are derived equivalent.

Moreover, for every d ∈ Z≥0, Rouquier [R1] and Chuang and Kessar [CK]
identify special representatives Λ0 − α ∈ Od for which the corresponding blocks
Hα(q) have a particularly nice structure. These blocks are known as RoCK blocks.
Thus for any n, every block of Hn(q) is derived equivalent to a RoCK block.

Let Hα(q) be a RoCK block. Turner [Tu1, Tu2, Tu3] developed a theory of
double algebras and conjectured that Hα(q) is Morita equivalent to an appro-
priate double [Tu1, Conjecture 165]. The aim of this paper is to prove Turner’s
Conjecture. In fact, we prove a slightly more general result stated in terms of
cyclotomic KLR algebras over Z.

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

To state the result precisely, we now recap Turner’s theory as developed in
[EK]. Let Q be a type Ae−1 quiver, and let PQ be the quotient of the path
algebra ZQ by all paths of length 2. As a Z-module, PQ has an obvious basis
whose elements are identiﬁed with the vertices and the edges of Q. We view
PQ as a Z-superalgebra with PQ,¯0 being the span of the vertices and PQ,¯1 being
the span of the edges. We denote by ¯x ∈ {¯0, ¯1} the degree of a homogeneous
element x of any superalgebra. Let n ∈ Z>0, and consider the matrix superalgebra
X := Mn(PQ).

For every d ∈ Z≥0 we have a superalgebra structure on X ⊗d induced by that

being as above, and xy = 0 for x ∈ X ⊗d and y ∈ X ⊗f with d 6= f . In fact,

on X. SoLd≥0 X ⊗d is a superalgebra, with the product on each summand X ⊗d
Ld≥0 X ⊗d is even a superbialgebra with the coproduct

∆ : X ⊗d → M0≤f ≤d
ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd 7→ X0≤f ≤d

X ⊗f ⊗ X ⊗(d−f ),

(ξ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξf ) ⊗ (ξf +1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ξd).

The symmetric group Sd acts on X ⊗d by signed place permutations with su-

peralgebra automorphisms, so the set of ﬁxed points Invd X := (cid:0)X ⊗d(cid:1)Sd is a
subsuperalgebra of X ⊗d, and Inv X := Ld≥0 Invd X is a subsuperbialgebra of
Ld≥0 X ⊗d.
There is a superbialgebra structure on (Inv X)∗ := Ld≥0(Invd X)∗ which is

dual to that on Inv X. We also have an Inv X-bimodule structure on (Inv X)∗
deﬁned by

(x · ξ)(η) = x(ξη), (ξ · x)(η) = x(ηξ)

(ξ, η ∈ Inv X, x ∈ (Inv X)∗).

The Turner double is the superalgebra DX := Inv X ⊗(Inv X)∗, with the product
deﬁned, using Sweedler’s notation for the coproduct ∆, by

(ξ ⊗ x)(η ⊗ y) =X(−1)

¯ξ(1)(¯ξ(2)+¯η+¯x)+¯η(1) ¯xξ(2)η(1) ⊗ (x · η(2))(ξ(1) · y)

for all homogeneous ξ, η ∈ Inv X and x, y ∈ (Inv X)∗. We have a decomposition

DX =Ld≥0 DdX as a direct sum of superalgebras, where

Invf X ⊗ (Invd−f X)∗

DdX := M0≤f ≤d

is a direct sum of Z-supermodules. Each superalgebra DdX is symmetric.

The superalgebra PQ is Z-graded with all vertices of Q being in degree 0 and all
edges in degree 1. This induces gradings on Mn(PQ) and Inv X = Inv Mn(PQ) in
the natural way. We view each (Invd X)∗ as a graded Z-module, with the grading
induced from Invd X shifted by 2d, i.e. for x ∈ (Invd X)∗ we have deg x =
m if and only if x is zero on all graded components of Invd X other than the
(2d − m)th component. Then DdX is a Z-graded superalgebra concentrated in
degrees 0, 1, . . . , 2d. In fact, this grading is a reﬁnement of the superstructure on
DdX, in the sense that (DdX)¯0 is the sum of even graded components of DdX

BLOCKS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS AND SEMICUSPIDAL KLR ALGEBRAS

3

and (DdX)¯1 is the sum of odd graded components. From now on, we forget the
superstructure on DdX and view

DQ(n, d) := DdX

simply as a graded Z-algebra.

As before, let Hα(q) be a RoCK block, with Λ0−α ∈ Od. The precise conditions
that α must satisfy in order for this to be the case are stated in §5.4. Let RΛ0
α be
the corresponding cyclotomic KLR algebra, which has a natural grading, see §4.2.

Theorem A. If n ≥ d, then the Z-algebras RΛ0
equivalent.

α and DQ(n, d) are graded Morita

For any graded Z-algebra A, deﬁne AF := A ⊗Z F. The F-algebra RΛ0

α,F is
isomorphic to the RoCK block Hα(q) of a Hecke algebra, see [BK1,R2]. Applying
this result and the aforementioned theorem of Chuang-Rouquier, one deduces the
following from Theorem A:

Corollary B. If n ≥ d, then:

(i) The RoCK block Hα(q) is Morita equivalent to DQ(n, d)F.
(ii) For every β with Λ0 − β ∈ Od, the algebra Hβ(q) is derived equivalent to

DQ(n, d)F.

Alperin’s Weight Conjecture [Al] predicts an equality between the number
of simple modules of an arbitrary block of a ﬁnite group and the number of
‘weights’ deﬁned in terms of normalisers of local p-subgroups.
In the case of
blocks with abelian defect group, the conjecture of Brou´e [Br] lifts Alperin’s
Weight Conjecture to the categorical level, but no such categorical conjecture is
known for blocks of arbitrary ﬁnite groups with non-abelian defect groups.

An important step in the proof of Brou´e’s conjecture for symmetric groups is
the theorem [CK] asserting that, if q = 1 and d < char F, then there is a Morita
equivalence between the RoCK block Hα(1) and the wreath product algebra
Hδ(1)⊗d ⋊ FSd. Corollary B shows that, for an arbitrary block of a symmetric
group, the corresponding double DQ(n, d)F is a ‘local’ object that can replace
Hδ(1)⊗d ⋊ FSd in the context of Brou´e’s conjecture.

In fact, the wreath product Hδ(q)⊗d ⋊ FSd has a Z-form (RΛ0

δ )⊗d ⋊ ZSd that
is closely related to DQ(n, d). Denote by Z the zigzag algebra of type Ae−1 over
Z, and consider the wreath product Wd := Z⊗d ⋊ ZSd, see §3.1. Then Z is
Morita equivalent to RΛ0
δ , and more generally Wd is (graded) Morita equivalent
to (RΛ0
δ )⊗d ⋊ FSd, see the proof of Proposition 8.29. On the other hand, the
double DQ(n, d) can be identiﬁed with a subalgebra of a generalized Schur algebra
S Z(n, d), and there is a Schur-Weyl duality between S Z(n, d) and Wd, see §3.2.
In particular, for a certain explicit idempotent ξω ∈ DQ(n, d), we have

ξωDQ(n, d)ξω = ξωS Z(n, d)ξω ∼= Wd.

Thus, the idempotent truncation ξωDQ(n, d)ξω is Morita equivalent to RΛ0

δ ⋊FSd.
If d < char F or char F = 0, the double DQ(n, d)F is Morita equivalent to
∼= Hδ(q)⊗d ⋊ FSd, see Proposition 8.29. When
ξωDQ(n, d)Fξω ∼= (RΛ0
d ≥ char F > 0, the algebra DQ(n, d)F has more isomorphism classes of simple

δ,F)⊗d ⋊ FSd

4

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

modules than ξωDQ(n, d)Fξω. As was predicted in [Tu1, Conjecture 82] and
proved in [Ev], a certain explicit idempotent truncation of the RoCK block Hα(q)
is Morita equivalent to Hδ(q)⊗d ⋊ FSd in all cases. Corollary B(i) strengthens
this result, replacing the idempotent truncation by the whole RoCK block Hα(q).
We now outline the proof of Theorem A and the contents of the paper. Sec-
tion 2 contains some general deﬁnitions and notation. In Section 3, we review
necessary deﬁnitions and results from [EK].
In particular, we introduce the
zigzag algebra Z and the wreath product Wd. An important role is played by the
(right) colored permutation Wd-modules Mλ,c, which are parametrized by colored
compositions (λ, c). Here, λ is a composition of d and c is a tuple consisting of
elements of {1, . . . , e − 1} that assigns a ‘color’ to each part of λ. In fact, the
proof of Theorem A uses only colored compositions with n(e − 1) parts of the
form (λ, c0), where c0 is given by (3.13), but it is more natural to work with more
general colored compositions. We deﬁne the generalized Schur algebra S Z(n, d)
as the endomorphism algebra of the direct sum of the appropriate Wd-modules
Mλ,c0 and review results identifying the Turner double DZ(n, d) as an explicit
Z-subalgebra of S Z(n, d).

Section 4 begins with the deﬁnition and standard properties of the KLR alge-
bras Rθ and their cyclotomic quotients RΛ0
θ . In §4.5 we deﬁne the semicuspidal
algebra ˆCdδ as an explicit quotient of Rdδ. In 4.6, we consider parabolic subalge-
bras of ˆCdδ.

In §5.4, we recall the deﬁnition of a RoCK block RΛ0

α and construct a natural
homomorphism Ω : ˆCdδ → RΛ0
α . The quotient Cρ,d := ˆCdδ/ ker Ω is isomorphic to
an idempotent truncation of RΛ0
α , which is later shown to be Morita equivalent to
α . We note that Cρ,d is ﬁnitely generated as a Z-module, but ˆCdδ is not. The
RΛ0
arguments of §5.4 rely on results connecting cyclotomic KLR algebras with the
combinatorics of standard tableaux and abaci, which are reviewed and developed
in §§5.1–5.3.

In §6.1 we deﬁne the Gelfand-Graev idempotent γλ,c ∈ Rdδ for every colored
composition (λ, c) of d and an ‘uncolored’ idempotent γω ∈ Rdδ. The latter may
be viewed as a KLR counterpart of ξω ∈ S Z(n, d). The following two results are
key to the proof of Theorem A:

(i) There is an explicit algebra isomorphism Wd

∼
−→ γωCρ,dγω (see Theo-

rem 8.9).

(ii) If γωCρ,dγω is identiﬁed with Wd via the isomorphism in (i), then there
∼−→ γλ,cCρ,dγω of right Wd-modules (see

is an explicit isomorphism Mλ,c
Theorem 8.15).

The isomorphism (i) is a slight generalization of the main result of [Ev] and is
constructed in §§7.1,8.1 using a homomorphism [KM3] from Wd to γω ˆCdδγω. In
order to prove (ii), we ﬁrst show that γλ,cCρ,dγω and Mλ,c have the same rank
as free Z-modules, see Corollary 6.31. This relies on combinatorial results about
RoCK blocks proved in §§6.2–6.4. Secondly, in §§7.3,7.4, we prove several results
on the structure of γλ,c ˆCdδγω.
In particular, we ﬁnd an explicit element that
generates γλ,c ˆCdδγω as a right γω ˆCdδγω-module, see Corollary 7.32. We use this

BLOCKS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS AND SEMICUSPIDAL KLR ALGEBRAS

5

element to construct a homomorphism from Mλ,c to γλ,c ˆCdδγω and ultimately to
prove (ii).

In §8.3, we deﬁne the algebra E(n, d) as the endomorphism algebra of the
direct sum of (graded shifts of) certain projective left Cρ,d-modules Cρ,dγλ,c.
Using the right Wd-modules γλ,cCρ,dγω and the isomorphism (ii), we construct a
natural homomorphism Φ : E(n, d) → S Z(n, d). Finally, using the identiﬁcation
of the Turner double DQ(n, d) as a subalgebra of S Z(n, d) stated in Section 3
as well as results about the semicuspidal algebra proved in Section 7, we show
that Φ is injective with image exactly DQ(n, d), so that E(n, d) ∼= DQ(n, d) (see
Theorem 8.23).

A priori, it follows from our constructions that E(n, d) is Morita equivalent
In §8.4, we prove that
α by showing that the
α to any algebraically closed ﬁeld have the

to an idempotent truncation of the RoCK block RΛ0
α .
E(n, d) ∼= DQ(n, d) is (graded) Morita equivalent to RΛ0
scalar extensions of DQ(n, d) and RΛ0
same number of simple modules.

2. Preliminaries

For any m, n ∈ Z, we deﬁne the (possibly empty) segment

[m, n] := {l ∈ Z | m ≤ l ≤ n}.

Let l, m, n ∈ Z≥0 and I be a set. For any i ∈ I and tuples i = (i1, . . . , il) ∈ I l,

ij := (i1, . . . , il, j1, . . . , jm) ∈ I l+m,

in := i . . . i

∈ I ln.

|{z}n

j = (j1, . . . , jm) ∈ I m, we set
in := (i, . . . , i)

∈ I n,

|

n

{z

}

We write i1 . . . il instead of (i1, . . . , il) when there is no possibility of confusion.

2.1. Partitions and compositions. Fix n ∈ Z>0 and d ∈ Z≥0. We denote
by Λ(n) the set of compositions λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) with λ1, . . . , λn ∈ Z≥0. For
λ ∈ Λ(n) we write |λ| := λ1 + · · · + λn, and set Λ(n, d) := {λ ∈ Λ(n) | |λ| = d}.
If m ∈ Z≥0, we deﬁne mλ := (mλ1, . . . , mλn) ∈ Λ(n).

Let S be an arbitrary ﬁnite set. We deﬁne ΛS(n, d) to be the set of tuples

λ = (λ(i))i∈S of compositions in Λ(n) such thatPi∈S |λ(i)| = d.

We denote by P the set of all partitions. For λ = (λ1, . . . , λm) ∈ P we write
ℓ(λ) := max{k | λk > 0} and |λ| := λ1 + · · · + λm. We set P(d) := {λ ∈ P |
|λ| = d}. We do not assume that the parts λk of the partition λ are positive, and
we identify a partition (λ1, . . . , λm) with any partition (λ1, . . . , λm, 0, . . . , 0).

We deﬁne the set of S-multipartitions P S as the set of tuples λ = (λ(i))i∈S

of partitions. For λ ∈ P S, we set |λ| :=Pi∈S |λ(i)| and P S (d) := {λ ∈ P S |

|λ| = d}. The only multipartition in P S(0) is denoted by ∅.

We set NS := Z>0 × Z>0 × S and refer to the elements of NS as nodes. When
S has one element, we identify NS with N := Z>0 × Z>0. If λ = (λ(i))i∈S ∈ P S
is an S-multipartition, its Young diagram, which we often identify with λ, is

JλK := {(r, s, i) ∈ NS | s ≤ λ(i)

r }.

If (r, s, i) ∈ NS, we say that (r, s + 1, i) is the right neighbor of (r, s, i) and
(r + 1, s, i) is the bottom neighbor of (r, s, i). Deﬁne a partial order < on NS as

6

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

follows: (r, s, i) ≤ (r′, s′, i′) if and only if i = i′, r ≤ r′ and s ≤ s′. Given a
multipartition λ ∈ P S, a function T : JλK → Z>0 is said to be weakly increasing
if whenever u ≤ v are in JλK we have T(u) ≤ T(v). If u, v ∈ NS and neither u ≤ v
nor v ≤ u, then we say that u and v are independent. Two subsets U, V ⊆ NS are
said to be independent if every element of U is independent from every element
of V . We say that a subset U ⊆ NS is convex if whenever u ≤ v ≤ w are in NS
and u, w ∈ U , we have v ∈ U .

A skew partition is a pair (λ, µ) of partitions such that JµK ⊆ JλK. We denote

it by λ \ µ and set |λ \ µ| := |λ| − |µ|. We identify λ \ ∅ with λ.

2.2. Symmetric groups and parabolic subgroups. Let d ∈ Z≥0. We denote
by Sd the symmetric group on {1, . . . , d} and set sr := (r, r + 1) ∈ Sd for
r = 1, . . . , d − 1 to be the elementary transpositions. For every n ∈ Z>0 and
λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) ∈ Λ(n, d), we have the standard parabolic subgroup

Sλ

∼= Sλ1 × · · · × Sλn ≤ Sd.

Moreover, for an ordered set S = {1, . . . , l} and λ = (λ(1), . . . , λ(l)) ∈ ΛS(n, d),
we deﬁne the parabolic subgroup

Sλ

∼= Sλ(1) × · · · × Sλ(l) ≤ Sd.

If g ∈ Sd and g = sr1 . . . srl is a reduced decomposition of g, i.e. a decomposition
as a product of elementary transpositions with l smallest possible, then we deﬁne
ℓ(g) := l and refer to l as the length of g. For any λ, µ ∈ Λ(n, d), we denote by
D λ the set of the minimal length coset representatives for Sd/Sλ, by µD the set
of the minimal length coset representatives for Sµ\Sd and by µD λ the set of the
minimal length coset representatives for Sµ\Sd/Sλ.

2.3. Algebras and modules. In this paper we mostly work over the ground
ring Z. Occasionally, we use the prime ﬁelds Fp and their algebraic closures ¯Fp.
All gradings in this paper are Z-gradings. Let q be an indeterminate. Given a
n=1 Zvk with homogeneous generators vk, we write
n=1 qdeg(vn) ∈ Z[q, q−1] and
dim V := k. Throughout, V n denotes the nth graded component of V for any
n ∈ Z. Given m ∈ Z, let qmV denote the module obtained by shifting the grading

graded free Z-module V ∼=Lk
dimq V for the graded rank of V , i.e. dimq V := Pk
on V up by m, i.e. (qmV )n := V n−m. We use the notation V >m :=Ln>m V n.
deﬁne [m]! :=Qm

For any m ∈ Z, we set [m] := (qm − q−m)/(q − q−1) ∈ Z[q, q−1]. If m ∈ Z≥0, we

k=1[k].

Let A be a (Z-)graded algebra. All A-modules are assumed to be graded. Let
A-mod denote the category of all ﬁnitely generated (graded) A-modules, with
morphisms being degree-preserving module homomorphisms. Given A-modules V
and W , we denote by homA(V, W ) the space of morphisms in A-mod. For any m ∈
Z, deﬁne HomA(V, W )m := homH(qmV, W ). This is the space of homomorphisms
that are homogeneous of degree m. Set

HomA(V, W ) :=Mm∈Z

HomA(V, W )m.

BLOCKS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS AND SEMICUSPIDAL KLR ALGEBRAS

7

In particular, EndA(V ) := HomA(V, V ) is a graded algebra. All homomorphisms
between graded algebras are assumed to be degree-preserving. We have the grad-
ing shift functor q : A-mod → A-mod, V 7→ qV .

Given an A-module V and a commutative ring k, we denote by Ak := A ⊗Z k
the (graded) algebra obtained by scalar extension, and by Vk := V ⊗Z k the
corresponding Ak-module. If B = A/K is the quotient of A by an ideal B and
x ∈ A, we denote an element x + K of B simply by x when there is no possibility
of confusion.

If k is a ﬁeld and A is a ﬁnite-dimensional graded k-algebra, we denote by ℓ(A)
the number of irreducible graded A-modules up to isomorphism and degree shift.

3. Zigzag algebras, wreath products and Turner doubles

Throughout the paper, we ﬁx e ∈ Z≥2.

3.1. Zigzag algebras and wreath products. Let Q be a type Ae−1 quiver
with vertex set

J := {1, . . . , e − 1}.

(3.1)

We will use the zigzag algebra Z of type Ae−1, deﬁned in [HK] as follows. First
assume that e > 2. Let ˆQ be the quiver with vertex set J and an arrow ak,j from
j to k for all ordered pairs (k, j) ∈ J 2 such that |k − j| = 1:

Then Z is the path algebra Z ˆQ, generated by length 0 paths ej for j ∈ J and
length 1 paths ak,j, subject to the following relations:
(i) All paths of length three or greater are zero.
(ii) All paths of length two that are not cycles are zero.
(iii) All cycles of length 2 based at the same vertex are equal.

The algebra Z inherits the path length grading from Z ˆQ.
Z := Z[c]/(c2), where c is an indeterminate in degree 2.

If e = 2, we deﬁne

If k, j ∈ J, we say that k and j are neighbors if |k − j| = 1. If e > 2, for every
vertex j ∈ J pick its neighbor k and denote c(j) := aj,kak,j. The relations in Z
c(j). Then in all

imply that c(j) is independent of choice of k. Deﬁne c :=Pj∈J

cases Z has a basis

BZ := {ak,j | k ∈ J, j is a neighbor of k} ∪ {cmej | j ∈ J, m ∈ {0, 1}},

and

dimq Z = (e − 1)(1 + q2) + 2(e − 2)q.

Moreover, using (3.2), we see that for any j ∈ J

dim ej Z =

4 if 1 < j < e − 1,
3 if j ∈ {1, e − 1} and e > 2,
2 if j = 1 and e = 2.

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

8

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

We will also consider the graded wreath products

Wd := Z⊗d ⋊ ZSd,

(3.5)
with ZSd concentrated in degree 0. (Note that, unlike [EK], we do not consider
any superstructures here.) As usual, we identify Z⊗d and ZSd with the subalge-
bras Z⊗d ⊗ 1Sd and 1⊗d
Z ⊗ ZSd of Wd, respectively. The multiplication in Wd is
then uniquely determined by the additional requirement that

g−1(x1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xd)g = xg1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ xgd

(3.6)

for g ∈ Sd and x1, . . . , xd ∈ Z. Given x ∈ Z and 1 ≤ a ≤ d, we denote

x[a] := 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 ⊗ x ⊗ 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 ∈ Z⊗d,

with x in the ath position. We have the idempotents

ej := ej1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ejd ∈ Z⊗d ⊆ Wd

(j ∈ J d).

Fix n ∈ Z>0. We deﬁne the set of colored compositions

(3.7)
Let (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d) with λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) and c = (c1, . . . , cn). We deﬁne the
idempotent

Λcol(n, d) := Λ(n, d) × J n.

eλ,c := e⊗λ1

c1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ e⊗λn

cn ∈ Z⊗d

(3.8)

and the parabolic subalgebra

Wλ,c = eλ,c ⊗ ZSλ ⊆ Wd.

Note that eλ,c is the identity element of Wλ,c, so Wλ,c is a (usually non-unital)
subalgebra of Wd, isomorphic to the group algebra ZSλ.

We assign signs ζj to the elements j ∈ J according to the following rule:

ζj =(cid:26) +1 if j is odd,

−1 if j is even.

(3.9)

(3.10)

Consider the function ελ,c : Sλ → {±1} ⊆ Z deﬁned by

ελ,c(g1, . . . , gn) := ζ ℓ(g1)

c1

· · · ζ ℓ(gn)

cn

for all (g1, . . . , gn) ∈ Sλ1 × · · · × Sλn = Sλ. We deﬁne the c-alternating right
module altλ,c = Z · 1λ,c over Wλ,c with the action on the basis element 1λ,c given
by

1λ,c · (eλ,c ⊗ g) = ελ,c(g)1λ,c

(g ∈ Sλ).

We have identiﬁed Z⊗d and ZSd as subalgebras of Wd, so we can also view eλ,c
as an element of Wd. Then Wλ,c = eλ,c(ZSλ)eλ,c and eλ,cWd is naturally a left
Wλ,c-module. We now deﬁne the colored permutation module

Mλ,c := altλ,c ⊗Wλ,c

eλ,cWd.

(3.11)

This is a right Wd-module with generator mλ,c := 1λ,c ⊗ eλ,c.

In this subsection, we use this bijection to translate the results of [EK, §7.2] into

For any λ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d), we deﬁne

M λ := Mλ,c0.

Let

M (n, d) := Mλ∈Λ(n(e−1),d)

M λ.

(3.14)

Following [EK], we consider the generalized Schur algebra

S Z(n, d) := EndWd (M (n, d)) .

Since the algebra Wd is non-negatively graded, so are the modules M λ. Since
M λ has the degree zero generator

mλ := mλ,c0

as a Wd-module, it follows that the algebra S Z(n, d) is non-negatively graded.

For λ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d), let ξλ ∈ S Z(n, d) be the projection onto the direct
summand M λ of M (n, d) along the decomposition (3.14). We always identify
ξµS Z(n, d)ξλ with HomWd(M λ, M µ) in the obvious way.
Let λ ∈ Λ((n − 1)(e − 1), d − 1). For j ∈ J, we deﬁne

I := Z/eZ = {0, . . . , e − 1}.

We consider the quiver of type A(1)
whenever j = i + 1. The corresponding Cartan matrix (cij)i,j∈I is deﬁned by

e−1 with vertex set I and a directed edge i → j

any m ∈ Z≥0, the symmetric group Sm acts from the left on the set I m by place
permutations. If i = i1 . . . im ∈ I m then its weight is |i| := αi1 + · · · + αim ∈ Q+.
Then the Sm-orbits on I m are the sets I θ := {i ∈ I m | |i| = θ} parametrized by

(4.11)

The algebras Rθ and RΛ0

For κ ∈ I = Z/eZ and i = (i1, . . . , in) ∈ I n, we set i+κ := (i1 + κ, . . . , in + κ) ∈

4.3. Parabolic subalgebras. For θ1, . . . , θr ∈ Q+ and θ = θ1 + · · · + θr, we have
a non-unital embedding

ιθ1,...,θr : Rθ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Rθr → Rθ

(4.16)

whose image is the parabolic subalgebra Rθ1,...,θr ⊆ Rθ. Denoting by 1θ the identity
element in Rθ, we set

1θ1,...,θr := ιθ1,...,θr (1θ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1θr ).

(4.17)

We have

1θ1,...,θr =

Xi(1)∈I θ1 ,...,i(r)∈I θr

1i(1)...i(r).

Note that we always identify Rθ1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ Rθr with Rθ1,...,θr via ιθ1,...,θr .

We have the corresponding induction and restriction functors

Indθ1,...,θr : Rθ1,...,θr -mod → Rθ-mod, W 7→ Rθ1θ1,...,θr ⊗Rθ1,...,θr W,
Resθ1,...,θr : Rθ-mod → Rθ1,...,θr -mod, U 7→ 1θ1,...,θr U.

Let W1 ∈ Rθ1-mod, . . . , Wr ∈ Rθr -mod. We deﬁne

W1 ◦ · · · ◦ Wr := Indθ1,...,θr W1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ Wr.

We refer to the elements of I θ as words. Given W ∈ Rθ-mod and i ∈ I θ, we say
that i is a word of W if 1iW 6= 0. If every Wi is free of ﬁnite rank as a Z-module,

we deﬁne the formal character of W as chq W =Pi∈I θ (dimq Wi)i ∈ Z[q, q−1] · I θ.

Given a composition λ ∈ Λ(r, m) and words i(1) ∈ I λ1, . . . , i(r) ∈ I λr , a word
i ∈ I m is called a shuﬄe of i(1), . . . , i(r) if i = g · (i(1) . . . i(r)) for some g ∈ D λ.
By [KL, Lemma 2.20], an element i ∈ I m is a word of W1 ◦ · · · ◦ Wr if and only
if i is a shuﬄe of words i(1), . . . , i(r) where i(s) is a word of Ws for s = 1, . . . , r.
We will need the following weak version of the Mackey Theorem for KLR

algebras, see [Ev, Proposition 3.7] or the proof of [KL, Proposition 2.18]:

Lemma 4.18. Let θ1, . . . , θr, θ′

Everything in this subsection so far makes sense over any ground ring.

In
particular the notion of a semicuspidal module over Rdδ,F is deﬁned for any ﬁeld
F. We now explain the classiﬁcation of the semicuspidal irreducible Rdδ,F-modules
for an arbitrary ﬁeld F.

We begin with the case d = 1, in which case the semicuspidal irreducible Rdδ,F-
modules are parametrized by the elements of J = {1, . . . , e − 1} = I \ {0}. More
precisely, let j ∈ J. We denote by I δ,j the set of all words in I δ of the form
0kj where k is an arbitrary shuﬄe of the words (1, 2, . . . , j − 1) and (e − 1, e −
2, . . . , j + 1). Let Lδ,j be the graded Z-module with basis {vi | i ∈ I δ,j} where all
basis elements have degree 0. By [KR, Theorem 3.4], there is a unique structure
of a graded Rδ-module on Lδ,j such that

1j vi = δi,jvi, yrvi = 0, ψrvi =(cid:26) vsr i

0

if sri ∈ I δ,j,
if sri 6∈ I δ,j

(4.27)

for all admissible i, j, r. All the words in I δ,j are separated, so the module Lδ,j
is semicuspidal, which implies that I δ,j ⊆ I δ
sc.

For example,

I δ,1 = {(0, e − 1, e − 2, . . . , 1)}

and I δ,e−1 = {(0, 1, . . . , e − 1)},

so Lδ,1 and Lδ,e−1 have Z-rank 1. On the other hand, for e ≥ 3, the module
Lδ,e−2 has Z-rank e − 2, since

I δ,e−2 = {(0, 1, . . . , r, e − 1, r + 1, r + 2, . . . , e − 2) | 0 ≤ r < e − 2}.

For a composition d = (d1, . . . , de−1) ∈ Λ(e − 1, d), consider the semicuspidal

Rdδ-module V d := L◦d1

δ,1 ◦ · · · ◦ L◦de−1
δ,e−1 .

Theorem 4.28. Let F be an arbitrary ﬁeld. There is an assignment λ 7→ L(λ)
which maps every element λ ∈ P J (d) to a semicuspidal irreducible Rdδ,F-module
L(λ) such that

(i) {L(λ) | λ ∈ P J (d)} is a complete and irredundant set of irreducible

semicuspidal Rdδ,F-modules;

(ii) Let d = (d1, . . . , de−1) ∈ Λ(e − 1, d) and

P J (d) = {λ = (λ(1), . . . , λ(e−1)) ∈ P J (d) | |λ(j)| = dj for all j ∈ J}.
Then {L(λ) | λ ∈ P J (d)} is the set of composition factors of V d
F .

Proof. This is essentially contained in [K2] and [KM1], but we provide some de-
tails for the reader’s convenience. In this proof, we drop the subscript F from our
notation. Fix n ∈ Z≥d. Let j ∈ J, m ∈ Z≥0, and ν ∈ Λ(n, m). In [KM1, §1.4],

δ,j are constructed. Let Zj := Lν∈Λ(n,m) Z ν

certain submodules Z ν
j and
Sm,j := Rdδ/AnnRdδ (Zj). In [KM1, Theorems 4 and 6] a complete and irredun-
dant family {Lj(λ) | λ ∈ P(m)} of irreducible Sm,j-modules is constructed and
it is proved that Zj is a projective generator for Sm,j, hence every Lj(λ) appears
as a composition factor of Zj. But Zj is a direct sum of submodules of L◦m
δ,j and
one of the summands is L◦m
itself. So every Lj(λ) appears as a composition
δ,j
factor of L◦m
δ,j .

Now, for λ ∈ P J (d), we consider the Rdδ-module L(λ) := L1(λ(1)) ◦ · · · ◦
Le−1(λ(e−1)). By [K2, Theorem 5.10], this module is semicuspidal and irreducible,
and {L(λ) | λ ∈ P J (d)} is a complete and irredundant set of irreducible semi-
cuspidal Rdδ,F-modules, proving (i). Now (ii) follows from the description of the
composition factors of each L◦dj

irreducible semicuspidal Rdδ,F-module L such that 1i,FL 6= 0. By Theorem 4.28,

the word i is a shuﬄe of words i(1), . . . , i(d) such that each i(a) ∈Fj∈J I δ,j. (cid:3)

4.6. Induction and restriction of semicuspidal modules. Throughout the
subsection we ﬁx d ∈ Z≥0, n ∈ Z>0 and λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) ∈ Λ(n, d). Denote

Rλδ := Rλ1δ,...,λnδ ⊆ Rdδ.

Let 1λδ denote the identity element of Rλδ. Deﬁne the semicuspidal parabolic
subalgebra

ˆCλδ ⊆ ˆCdδ

to be the image of Rλδ under the natural projection Rdδ։ ˆCdδ. Whereas the
parabolic subalgebra Rλδ has been identiﬁed with Rλ1δ ⊗ · · · ⊗ Rλnδ via the
∼= ˆCλ1δ ⊗ · · · ⊗ ˆCλnδ. This
embedding ιλ1δ,...,λnδ, it is not clear a priori that ˆCλδ
will be proved in Lemma 4.33.

We call an Rλ1δ ⊗· · ·⊗Rλnδ-module W semicuspidal if (1i(1) ⊗· · ·⊗1i(n))W = 0
whenever i(1), . . . , i(n) are not all separated. This is equivalent to the property
that W factors through the natural quotient ˆCλ1δ ⊗· · ·⊗ ˆCλnδ of Rλ1δ ⊗· · ·⊗Rλnδ.

Lemma 4.31. We have:

(i) If W is a semicuspidal Rdδ-module, then Resλ1δ,...,λnδW is a semicuspidal

ˆCλ1δ⊗· · ·⊗ ˆCλnδ and induces an isomorphism ˆCλ1δ⊗· · ·⊗ ˆCλnδ
−→ ˆCλδ. Moreover,
ˆCdδ1λδ is a free right ˆCλδ-module with basis {ψw | w ∈ D eλ}.
Proof. That the map factors through ˆCλ1δ ⊗ · · · ⊗ ˆCλnδ follows from Lemma 4.31.
For the remaining claims, let us consider the Rdδ-module W := ˆCλ1δ ◦ · · · ◦ ˆCλnδ.
By Lemma 4.25, the module W factors through ˆCdδ. On the other hand by the

Basis Theorem 4.13 for Rdδ, we can decompose W = Lw∈D eλ ψw1λδ ⊗ ˆCλ1δ ⊗

· · · ⊗ ˆCλnδ as a Z-module, with each summand being naturally isomorphic to
ˆCλ1δ ⊗ · · · ⊗ ˆCλnδ as a Z-module. The lemma follows.
(cid:3)

In view of the lemma we identify ˆCλ1δ ⊗ · · · ⊗ ˆCλnδ with ˆCλδ. Then:

Corollary 4.34. Suppose that for each r = 1, . . . , n we have a ˆCλrδ-module Wr.
Then there is a natural isomorphism of semicuspidal Rdδ-modules

W1 ◦ · · · ◦ Wn

∼−→ ˆCdδ1λδ ⊗ ˆCλδ

(W1 ⊠ · · · ⊠ Wn),

u1λδ ⊗ w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wn 7→ ¯u1λδ ⊗ w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wn,

where ¯u ∈ ˆCdδ is the image of u ∈ Rdδ under the natural projection Rdδ։ ˆCdδ.

From now on we identify the induced modules as in the corollary.

5. Abaci, tableaux and RoCK blocks

5.1. Abaci. We will use the abacus notation for partitions, see [JK, Section 2.7].
Recall that we have ﬁxed a number e ∈ Z≥2 and I = Z/eZ. When convenient
we identify I with the subset {0, 1, . . . , e − 1} ⊂ Z. We deﬁne the abacus Ae :=
Z≥0 × I. For i ∈ I, the subset Ri := Z≥0 × {i} ⊂ Ae is referred to as the (ith)
runner of Ae.

Let λ be a partition, and ﬁx an integer N ≥ ℓ(λ), so that we can write λ =

(λ1, . . . , λN ). Let

AN (λ) := {λk + N − k | k = 1, . . . , N } ⊂ Z≥0.

The abacus display of λ is

N (λ) are called the beads of Ae

The elements of Ae

N (λ), and the elements of

We have the total order < on Ae deﬁned by the condition that (t, i) < (q, j) if
and only if et + i < eq + j. If (t, i) < (q, j), we say that (t, i) precedes (q, j) and
(q, j) succeeds (t, i). For any r ∈ Z>0, we say that a bead (t, i) of Ae
N (λ) is the
bead with number r in Ae
N (λ) succeed (t, i), and
we say that a non-bead (t, i) of Ae
N (λ) if
exactly r − 1 non-beads of Ae

N (λ) is the non-bead with number r in Ae

N (λ) if exactly r − 1 beads of Ae

N (λ) precede (t, i).

It is easy to see that the bead (t, i) with number r of Ae

1, λ′

Lemma 5.2. Let λ ∈ P and (r, s) ∈ N. Then (r, s) ∈ JλK if and only if the bead
with number r succeeds the non-bead with number s in Ae

N (λ).

For λ ∈ P, we write bi(λ) := | Ae

N (λ) ∩ Ri| for i ∈ I. The e-core of λ is the

partition core(λ) deﬁned by

N (core(λ)) = {(t, i) ∈ Ae | i ∈ I, 0 ≤ t < bi(λ)}.
Ae

Recall the notation (5.1). The e-quotient of λ is deﬁned as the multipartition
quotN (λ) = (λ(i))i∈I ∈ P I such that for every i ∈ I, the partition λ(i) is deter-
mined from Abi(λ)(λ(i)) = Ae
N (λ) ∩ Ri, where we have identiﬁed Ri with Z≥0. The
e-quotient of λ depends on the residue of N modulo e and changes by a ‘cyclic
permutation’ of the components λ(i) when this residue changes. So the e-weight
of λ, deﬁned as wt(λ) := | quotN (λ)|, does not depend on N .

Note that λ = core(λ) if and only quotN (λ) = ∅, in which case λ is said to be

an e-core. For any e-core ρ and d ∈ Z≥0, we set

Pρ := {λ ∈ P | core(λ) = ρ}, Pρ,d := {λ ∈ Pρ | wt(λ) = d}.

The following is easy to check and well known:

Lemma 5.3. The map λ 7→ quot(λ) is a bijection from Pρ,d to P I (d).

The (e-)residue of a node (r, s) ∈ N is res(r, s) := s − r + eZ ∈ I = Z/eZ. For

i ∈ I, we say that (r, s) is an i-node if its residue is i. For λ ∈ P, we deﬁne

cont(λ) := Xu∈JλK

αres(u) ∈ Q+.

Lemma 5.4.
Then cont(λ) = cont(ρ) + dδ if and only if λ ∈ Pρ,d.

[JK, Theorem 2.7.41] Let ρ be an e-core, d ∈ Z≥0, and λ ∈ P.

5.2. Tableaux. Let ν be a partition. A node u ∈ N is called an addable node for
ν if u /∈ JνK and JνK ∪ {u} is the Young diagram of a partition, and u is called a
removable node of ν if u ∈ JνK and JνK \ {u} is the Young diagram of a partition.
For i ∈ I, we denote by Add(ν, i) (resp. Rem(ν, i)) the set of all addable (resp.
removable) i-nodes for ν. We say that a node (r, s) is above a node (r′, s′) if

18

r < r′. Given a node v ∈ N and a ﬁnite subset U ⊂ N, denote by a(v, U ) the
number of elements of U which are above v.

Let λ \ µ be a skew partition, and θ = cont(λ \ µ) :=Pu∈JλK\JµK αres(u) ∈ Q+.

(ii) for all k = 1, . . . , r and u ∈ t−1(k), we have res u = ik;
(iii) for all k = 1, . . . , r, we have |t−1(k)| = mk.

We denote the set of all i-standard tableaux of shape λ \ µ by Std(λ \ µ, i). If
t ∈ Std(λ \ µ, i), we deﬁne

deg(t) =

rXk=1

dt−1(k)(t−1([1, k]) ∪ JµK).

Note that deg(t) depends on λ and µ, not just on the set JλK \ JµK. If i ∈ I θ and
µ = ∅, then the notion of an i-standard tableau is the same as the usual notion
of a standard tableau with residue sequence i as in [BKW, §3.2], and the notion
of the degree agrees with the one from [BKW, §3.5]. If i ∈ I η

then we set Std(λ \ µ, i) := ∅. We denote Std(λ \ µ) :=Fi∈I cont(λ\µ) Std(λ \ µ, i).

t−1(k) = s−1(cid:0)[m1 + · · · + mk−1 + 1, m1 + · · · + mk](cid:1)

for all k = 1, . . . , r. Let ˆt ⊆ Std(λ \ µ, ˆi) denote the set of all reﬁnements of t.

Lemma 5.5. For any t ∈ Std(λ \ µ, i), we havePs∈ˆt qdeg(s) = i!qdeg(t).

Proof. The lemma is easily reduced to the case r = 1. In that case, let s ∈ ˆt
be the tableau such that for u, v ∈ JλK \ JµK the node u is above v if and only if
s(u) < s(v), in other words we assign the numbers 1, . . . , m := m1 to the nodes
of λ \ µ from top to bottom. Then deg(s) = deg(t) + m(m − 1)/2. We have
ˆt = {ws | w ∈ Sm}, where ws is the tableaux deﬁned by (ws)(u) = w(s(u)).
In view of [BKW, Proposition 3.13], we have deg(ws) = deg(s) − 2ℓ(w), where
ℓ(w) is the length of w ∈ Sd. So

Xs∈ˆt

qdeg(s) = qdeg(t)+m(m−1)/2 Xw∈Sm

q−2ℓ(w) = [m]!qdeg(t),

where the last equality comes from the well-known formula for the Poincar´e poly-
nomial of the symmetric group [Hu, §3.15].

5.3. Dimensions and core algebras. Recall the notation (4.22). The following
is a variation of a known result:

Proof. The freeness statement follows from Theorem 4.14. Extending scalars to
C and using [BK2, Theorem 4.20] yields the graded rank formula in the case
when i, j ∈ I θ, and the general case then follows from Lemmas 4.24 and 5.5. (cid:3)

Recall the notation ℓ(A) for an algebra A from §2.3.

Theorem 5.7. Let k be a ﬁeld, ρ be an e-core and d ∈ Z≥0. Then

ℓ(RΛ0

cont(ρ)+dδ,k) = |P J (d)|.

Proof. By [KK, Theorem 6.2] or [LV, Theorem 7.5], the number ℓ(RΛ0
cont(ρ)+dδ,k) is
equal to the dimension of the weight space V (Λ0)Λ0−cont(ρ)−dδ for the integrable
highest weight module V (Λ0) over the Kac-Moody algebra g of type A(1)
e−1. It
is well known that this dimension is equal to |P J (d)|, see e.g. [Ka, (13.11.5)]
or [LLT, Sections 4,5].

cont(ρ) → EndZ(RΛ0

Proof. We clearly have a homomorphism ϕ : RΛ0
cont(ρ)1i) as in
the statement. In view of Theorem 4.14, to prove that ϕ is an isomorphism, it
suﬃces to prove its scalar extension ϕk is an isomorphism for any algebraically
closed ﬁeld k. By Theorem 5.7, the algebra RΛ0
cont(ρ),k has only one irreducible
module L up to isomorphism and degree shift. Considering the composition
series of the left regular module over RΛ0
cont(ρ),k, we see that i is an extremal
weight for L, hence by [K2, Lemma 2.8], the space 1iL is 1-dimensional.
It
follows that Hom
cont(ρ),k1i
∼= L. This
is the projective cover of L. We claim that in fact RΛ0
is known for k = C since RΛ0
indeed, by [BK1]
cont(ρ),C is a simple algebra:
it is a defect zero block of an Iwahori-Hecke algebra at an eth root of unity.
Hence Hom

Recall the map ζθ,η from (4.19).

Lemma 5.9. If ρ is an e-core and d ∈ Z≥0, then the map

ζcont(ρ),dδ : RΛ0

cont(ρ) → 1cont(ρ),dδRΛ0

cont(ρ)+dδ1cont(ρ),dδ

∼= L.

(cid:3)

is injective.

Proof. By Theorem 4.14, it suﬃces to prove that the scalar extension of the map
to C is injective. By Lemma 5.8, RΛ0
cont(ρ),C is a simple algebra, so it is enough
to show that 1cont(ρ),dδRΛ0
cont(ρ)+dδ1cont(ρ),dδ 6= 0. The last fact follows easily from
Theorem 5.6.
(cid:3)

5.4. RoCK blocks. Let ρ be an e-core and d ∈ Z≥1. Following [Tu1, Deﬁnition
52], we say that ρ is a d-Rouquier core if there exists an integer N ≥ ℓ(ρ) such
that for all i = 0, . . . , e − 2, the abacus display Ae
N (ρ) has at least d − 1 more
beads on runner i + 1 than on runner i. In this case,

κ := −N + eZ ∈ Z/eZ

is well-deﬁned and is called the residue of ρ.

If ρ is a d-Rouquier core, we refer to the cyclotomic KLR algebra RΛ0

cont(ρ)+dδ

as a RoCK block.

Remark 5.10. The term RoCK comes from the names of Rouquier [R1], Chuang
and Kessar [CK]. We refer to the algebra RΛ0
cont(ρ)+dδ as a block since, with
notation as in Section 1, the block Hcont(ρ)+dδ(q) of an Iwahori–Hecke algebra is
isomorphic to the F-algebra RΛ0
cont(ρ)+dδ,F, see [BK1, R2]. Note however that the
analogous isomorphism in general does not make sense over Z. Moreover, if k is a
ﬁeld such that e = m char k for some m ∈ Z>1, the algebra RΛ0
θ,k is not in general
isomorphic to a block of a Hecke algebra.

We now review and develop some results from [Ev, Section 4]. Throughout
the subsection, we ﬁx d ∈ Z>0 and a d-Rouquier core ρ of residue κ. We then set

α := cont(ρ) + dδ ∈ Q+.

Let

Ω : Rdδ → RΛ0

cont(ρ),dδ, x 7→ πα(cid:0)ιcont(ρ),dδ(1cont(ρ) ⊗ rotκ(x))(cid:1),

cf. (4.11), (4.12) and (4.16). Note that Ω is in general a non-unital algebra
homomorphism with Ω(1) = 1cont(ρ),dδ.

Lemma 5.11. Let i ∈ I dδ, and j ∈ I ρ be such that Std(ρ, j) 6= ∅. If 1j(i+κ) is
non-zero in RΛ0

sc . In particular, Ω factors through ˆCdδ.

cont(ρ)+dδ, then i ∈ I dδ

Proof. This follows from [Ev, Lemma 4.6] thanks to Theorem 5.6 and Corol-
lary 4.29.

In view of the lemma, from now on, we will consider Ω as a homomorphism

Ω : ˆCdδ → RΛ0

cont(ρ),dδ.

(5.12)

Lemma 5.13. Let σ be a partition such that JσK ( JρK. Then the number of
nodes of residue κ in JρK \ JσK is less than (|ρ| − |σ|)/e.

Proof. In this proof we use abacus displays with N beads, where N is greater
than the number of parts in all the partitions involved and N + eZ = −κ. Recall
from §5.1 that for τ ∈ P, we denote bi(τ ) := | Ae
N (τ ) ∩ Ri|. For 0 ≤ l < e, we
i=l bi(τ ). Recall also the fundamental dominant weights Λi

from §4.1. Let 0 ≤ m < e be the integer such that m + eZ = −κ.

denote b≥l(τ ) :=Pe−1

For any τ ∈ P, we claim that

e(Λκ, cont(τ )) − |τ | =

(e − 1)N − (e − m)m

−

b≥l(τ ).

(5.14)

e−1Xl=1

Indeed, it is straightforward to check that both sides are 0 when τ = ∅, since
b0(∅) = · · · = bm−1(∅) = bm(∅) + 1 = · · · = be−1(∅) + 1. Furthermore, adding a
box of residue i ∈ I to τ changes both sides by e − 1 if i = κ and by −1 if i 6= κ
(for the right-hand side, consult [Ev, Lemma 4.2]). The claim is proved.

Let l ∈ {0, . . . , e − 1} and b = bl(ρ). Suppose for a contradiction that b≥l(σ) >
N (ρ) contains the rectangle [0, b − 1] × [l, e − 1],

b≥l(ρ). As ρ is a Rouquier core, Ae
whence

| Ae

N (σ) ∩ (Z≥b × [l, e − 1])| > | Ae

N (ρ) ∩ (Z≥b × [l, e − 1])|,

and it follows that | AN (σ) ∩ Z≥be| > | AN (ρ) ∩ Z≥be|. This is a contradiction
to the hypothesis JσK ⊆ JρK. Hence, b≥l(σ) ≤ b≥l(ρ) for all l ∈ {0, . . . , e − 1}.
Moreover, the inequality must be strict for at least one l ∈ {1, . . . , e − 1}, for
otherwise we have bi(σ) = bi(ρ) for all i ∈ I, and so ρ = core(σ), contradicting the
hypothesis JσK ( JρK. Hence, using (5.14), we deduce that e(Λκ, cont(σ)) − |σ| >
e(Λκ, cont(ρ)) − |ρ|, which implies the lemma.
(cid:3)

Recall that throughout the subsection α = ρ + dδ is a RoCK block.

Lemma 5.15. We have 1cont(ρ),dδRΛ0

α 1cont(ρ),dδ = RΛ0

cont(ρ),dδ.

α 1cont(ρ),dδ is generated by RΛ0

gether with the elements ψw for w ∈ (|ρ|,de)D (|ρ|,de|) \ {1}. Thus, it will suﬃce
to show that 1cont(ρ),dδψw1cont(ρ),dδ = 0 in RΛ0
If not, then
1j′((i′)+κ)ψw1j(i+κ) 6= 0 for some j, j′ ∈ I cont(ρ) such that Std(ρ, j), Std(ρ, j′) are
non-empty, and some i, i′ ∈ I dδ
sc , see Theorem 5.6 and Lemma 5.11. In this case
t=1(|ρ| − m + t, |ρ| + t) for some m > 0,
and therefore the last m entries of j′ are i1 +κ, . . . , im +κ. Since i is semicuspidal,
the number of entries κ in the tuple (i1 + κ, . . . , im + κ) is at least m/e. But by
Lemma 5.13, this means that Std(ρ, j′) = ∅, a contradiction.
(cid:3)

w(j(i+κ)) = j′((i′)+κ). Moreover, w =Qm

α for each such w.

cont(ρ)+dδ

Lemma 5.18. The Z-module Cρ,d is free of ﬁnite rank.
Lemma 5.19. We have Zρ,d = ¯Ω(Cρ,d).
Proof. It is clear from the deﬁnitions that ¯Ω(Cρ,d) = Ω( ˆCdδ) ⊆ Zρ,d. Conversely,
cont(ρ) and
b1, . . . , bm ∈ Ω( ˆCdδ) = ¯Ω(Cρ,d), and we may assume that a1, . . . , am are linearly
independent with a1 = 1. By Lemma 5.16, x = b1, so x ∈ ¯Ω(Cρ,d).
(cid:3)

let x ∈ Zρ,d. We can write x = Pm

i=1 aibi for some a1, . . . , am ∈ RΛ0

In view of Lemma 5.16, we deduce:

Corollary 5.22. For any ﬁeld k, the algebra Cρ,d,k is symmetric. More precisely,

rem IV.4.1], an idempotent truncation of a symmetric algebra is symmetric, with
a symmetrizing form obtained by restriction. So it suﬃces to prove that RΛ0

orem 4.15 and an easy Lie-theoretic computation, see [K1, Lemma 11.1.4].

6. Dimensions

Throughout the section we ﬁx d ∈ Z>0, a d-Rouquier core ρ of residue κ, and
n ∈ Z>0. We also ﬁx an integer N ≥ |ρ| + de such that N + eZ = −κ and assume
in this section that all abaci have N beads, cf. §5.1.

The main goal of this section is to compute dimensions of certain idempotent
truncations of the algebras Cρ,d. The idempotents we use here are the so-called
Gelfand-Graev idempotents ﬁrst considered in [KM1].

6.1. Gelfand-Graev idempotents. Recall from §4.5 that for all j ∈ J, we have

deﬁned special Rδ-modules Lδ,j with chq Lδ,j =Pi∈I δ,j i. From now on, for every

For each µ ∈ Pρ,d and j ∈ I cont(ρ), in view of Lemma 5.4, we have a bijection

Std(µ, j(l(λ, c)+κ)) ∼−→ Std(ρ, j) × Std(µ \ ρ, l(λ, c)+κ), t 7→ (t0, t1)

where t0 = t|JρK and t1(u) = t(u) − |ρ| for all u ∈ JµK \ JρK. Moreover, by
deﬁnition, deg(t) = deg(t0) + deg(t1). Hence, the right-hand side of (6.10) is
equal to the right-hand side of (6.9) multiplied by

Xt0,t′

and the result follows after dividing both sides of (6.10) by dimq(RΛ0

The main aim of the rest of this section is to determine the rank of the free

Z-module γλ,cCρ,dγω for any (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d), see Corollaries 6.30 and 6.31.

6.2. Colored tableaux. A horizontal strip is a convex subset U of N such that
whenever (r, s) 6= (k, l) are in U we have s 6= l. A vertical strip is a convex subset
U of N such that whenever (r, s) 6= (k, l) are in U we have r 6= k.

Recalling the notation of §2.1, for any i ∈ I, we set NI,i = Z>0×Z>0×{i} ⊂ NI .
Identifying NI,i with N, we have a notion of what it means for a subset of NI,i to
be a horizontal or vertical strip. Given j ∈ J, we say that a subset U of NI is a
j-bend if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) U ⊂ NI,j−1 ∪ NI,j;
(ii) U ∩ NI,j−1 is a horizontal strip in NI,j−1, and U ∩ NI,j is a vertical strip

in NI,j.

Now let µ ∈ P I (d). Given (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d), we denote by CT(µ; λ, c) the set
of all weakly increasing maps T : JµK → {1, . . . , n} such that for all r = 1, . . . , n
the set T−1(r) is a cr-bend and |T−1(r)| = λr. We refer to the elements of
CT(µ; λ, c) as the colored tableaux of shape µ and type (λ, c).

Colored tableaux will play the role of a combinatorial intermediary connecting
the standard tableaux appearing in Lemma 6.8 and the explicit expression for
dim γλ,cCρ,dγω appearing on the right hand side of the formula in Corollary 6.30.

6.3. Counting standard tableaux in terms of colored tableaux. Given
0 ≤ i < e and u ∈ Z × Z, we call the image of J(i + 1, 1e−i−1)K under the
translation of Z × Z sending (1, 1) to u the e-hook with vertex u and arm length
i, or simply an e-hook.

Recall the abacus notation from §5.1. For any i ∈ I, let bi = bi(ρ), b>i =
j=0 bj. Since ρ is d-Rouquier, we have bi+1 ≥ bi + d − 1

Pe−1
j=i+1 bj and b<i =Pi−1

for i = 0, . . . , e − 2, and hence, for all i ≤ j in I,

b>i − b>j ≥ (bi + d − 1)(j − i),
b<j − b<i ≤ (bj − d + 1)(j − i).

(6.11)

(6.12)

Given (r, s, i) ∈ NI , deﬁne the integers

x(r, s, i) := r − (e − i − 1)(bi − r + s) + b>i,
y(r, s, i) := s + i(bi − r + s) − b<i.

be the e-hook with arm length i and vertex (x(r, s, i), y(r, s, i)). The following
lemma is a reﬁnement of [CK, Lemma 4] and [Ev, Lemma 4.3].

Lemma 6.13. Let µ ∈ Pρ,d and µ = quot(µ). Then

JµK = JρK ⊔ Gu∈JµK

H(u).

Moreover, every H(u) with u ∈ JµK has vertex of residue κ.

Proof. It is easy to check that y(r, s, i) − x(r, s, i) ≡ −N (mod e), so the second
statement holds.

For the ﬁrst statement, there is nothing to prove when |µ| = 0, so we assume
that |µ| ≥ 1 and choose (r, s, i) ∈ JµK such that JµK \ {(r, s, i)} = JνK for some
ν ∈ P I (d − 1). Arguing by induction on d, we may assume that the lemma holds
for the partition ν ∈ Pρ,d−1 determined from quot(ν) = ν, so it is enough to
show that JµK \ JνK = H(r, s, i).

Let µ = (µ(0), . . . , µ(e−1)) and ν = (ν(0), . . . , ν(e−1)). Then Jµ(i)K \ Jν(i)K =

{(r, s)} and Jµ(j)K = Jν(j)K for all j ∈ I \ {i}. We have

Ae

N (µ) =(cid:0) Ae

N (ν) \ {(a − 1, i)}(cid:1) ∪ {(a, i)}

for some a ∈ Z>0. In view of Lemma 5.2, Ae
N (µ) has bi − r beads and s non-beads
belonging to the runner Ri and preceding (a, i), so a = bi −r+s. By [CK, Lemma
4(1)], we have

(6.14)

Ae

Ae

N (µ) ⊇ [0, a − 1] × [i + 1, e − 1],
N (µ) ∩ (Z≥a × [0, i − 1]) = ∅.

(6.15)

(6.16)

In particular, each of (a−1, i+1), . . . , (a−1, e−1) is a bead of Ae
N (µ), and each of
(a, 0), . . . , (a, i − 1) is a non-bead of Ae
N (µ). By (6.14) and Lemma 5.2, it follows
that JµK \ JνK is an e-hook with arm length i and vertex (x, y) where x is the
number of the bead (a, i) and y is the number of the non-bead (a − 1, i) of Ae
N (µ),
cf. the proof of [CK, Lemma 4(2)]. Using (6.15), (6.16) and the fact that there are
r − 1 beads of Ae
N (µ) on Ri succeeding (a, i), we obtain x = r + b>i − a(e − i − 1) =
x(r, s, i). Similarly, y = s + ia − b<i = y(r, s, i).
(cid:3)

Corollary 6.17. Let 0 ≤ f ≤ d, and µ ∈ Pρ,d, ν ∈ Pρ,f be partitions with the
e-quotients µ, ν respectively. Then JνK ⊆ JµK if and only if JνK ⊆ JµK.

Proof. The if-part follows from Lemma 6.13. For the only-if-part, we apply in-
duction on d − f , the case d = f being obvious. Let d − f > 0. If JνK 6⊆ JµK, then
there is a node (r, s, i) ∈ JµK \ JνK such that JνK ∪ {(r, s, i)} = Jquot(λ)K for some
λ ∈ Pρ,f +1. Then JλK = JνK ⊔ H(r, s, i) ⊆ JµK by Lemma 6.13. By induction,
Jquot(λ)K ⊆ JµK, which is a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Lemma 6.18. For any j ∈ J, the set of standard lj-tableaux whose shape is a
partition consists of exactly two elements, t and s, where

(a) t has shape (j, 1e−j ), with t(e − j + 1, 1) = e, and deg(t) = 0.
(b) s has shape (j + 1, 1e−j−1), with s(1, j + 1) = e, and deg(s) = 1.

Proof. By Lemma 5.4, the shape of any standard tableau in question must be an
element of P∅,1, and the rest is easy to see.

The graded dimension of Cρ,d for d = 1 can be easily computed:

Lemma 6.19. For any k, j ∈ J, we have:

Proof. By Lemma 6.8, we have

if k and j are neighbors,
otherwise.

qdeg(t)+deg(t′).

Let µ ∈ Pρ,1. By Lemma 6.13, the set JµK \ JρK is an e-hook with a vertex
v of residue κ. Let i be the arm length of this e-hook and ν = (i + 1, 1e−i−1).
Denoting by τ the translation of Z × Z which maps (1, 1) to v, we have a bijection
∼
Std(µ \ ρ, (lk)+κ)
−→ Std(ν, lk) given by t 7→ s where s(u) = t(τ (u)) for all
u ∈ JνK (and similarly for lj). Moreover, we have deg(s) = deg(t) by [Ev, (4.6)].
Hence,

dimq (1lk Cρ,11lj ) =X qdeg(s)+deg(s′),

where the sum is over all µ ∈ P∅,1 and all pairs (s, s′) ∈ Std(µ, lk) × Std(µ, lj).
The result now follows by Lemma 6.18.
(cid:3)

Let H be an e-hook with arm length i and vertex (x, y) ∈ Z × Z, and let
G be another e-hook. We refer to the node (x, y + i) as the hand of H and to
(x + e − i − 1, y) as the foot of H. We call G a right extension of H if the foot of
G is the right neighbor of the hand of H. We call G a bottom extension of H if
the hand of G is the bottom neighbor of the foot of H. The following is deduced
from the deﬁnition of H(r, s, i) by an easy calculation:

Lemma 6.20. Let (r, s, i) ∈ NI .

(i) The hook H(r, s + 1, i) is a right extension of H(r, s, i).
(ii) The hook H(r + 1, s, i) is a bottom extension of H(r, s, i).

Lemma 6.21. Let µ ∈ P I (d). If nodes (r, s, i), (k, l, j) ∈ JµK are independent,
then H(r, s, i) and H(k, l, j) are independent.

Proof. First, suppose that i 6= j. Without loss of generality, i < j. Since |µ| = d,
we have k + s ≤ d. Also, bj − bi ≥ d − 1 as ρ is d-Rouquier. We have

y(k, l, j) − y(r, s, i) = (l − s) + i(bj − k + l − bi + r − s) + (j − i)(bj − k + l)

− (b<j − b<i)

≥ 1 − s + i(bj − bi + 2 − k − s) + (j − i)(−k + l + d − 1)
≥ 1 + i + d − k − s
≥ 1 + i,

where we have used (6.12) for the second step. Hence, the vertex of H(k, l, j)
has a greater second coordinate than the hand of H(r, s, i). A similar calculation
using (6.11) shows that x(r, s, i) − x(k, l, j) ≥ e − j, hence the vertex of H(r, s, i)

BLOCKS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS AND SEMICUSPIDAL KLR ALGEBRAS

27

has ﬁrst coordinate greater than that of the foot of H(k, l, j). Thus, H(r, s, i) and
H(k, l, j) are independent.

Now let i = j. Without loss of generality, k < r and l > s. We have

y(k, l, i) − y(r, s, i) = (l − s) + i(l − k + r − s) ≥ 1 + 2i ≥ 1 + i,

x(r, s, i) − x(k, l, i) = (r − k) + (e − i − 1)(r − s + l − k) ≥ e − i,

and it follows again that H(r, s, i) and H(k, l, j) are independent.

(cid:3)

Recall from (6.1) that for every j ∈ J, we have ﬁxed a word lj = (lj,1, . . . , lj,e) ∈
I δ,j. Deﬁne the map q : J × I → {1, . . . , e} by the condition that lj,q(j,i) = i for
all j ∈ J and i ∈ I. Let µ ∈ Pρ,d and 0 < f ≤ d. Suppose that ν ∈ Pρ,d−f is a
partition with JνK ⊆ JµK. Note that cont(µ \ ν) = f δ. For any j ∈ J, deﬁne the
function

tµ\ν,j : JµK \ JνK → {1, . . . , e}, u 7→ q(j, res(u) − κ).

For the notation lj(f ) = (l(f )

j,1 , . . . , l(f )

j,e ) ∈ I f δ

div in the following lemma see (6.2).

Lemma 6.22. Let j ∈ J and µ ∈ Pρ,d with e-quotient µ. Let 0 < f ≤ d and
ν ∈ Pρ,d−f with e-quotient ν satisfy JνK ⊆ JµK. Then

Std(µ \ ν, lj(f )+κ) =(cid:26) ∅

if JµK \ JνK is not a j-bend;

{tµ\ν,j} if JµK \ JνK is a j-bend.

JνK =Fu∈JµK\JνK

Proof. Since lj,1, . . . , lj,e ∈ I are all distinct, any element of Std(µ \ ν, lj(f )+κ)
must assign q(j, i − κ) to every node of residue i, i.e. such an element must be
tµ\ν,j. So it suﬃces to prove the following:
Claim. We have tµ\ν,j ∈ Std(µ \ ν, lj(f )+κ) if and only if JµK \ JνK is a j-bend.
For the claim, by Lemma 6.13 and Corollary 6.17, we have ν ⊂ µ and JµK \
H(u). Suppose that tµ\ν,j ∈ Std(µ \ ν, lj(f )+κ). Then, for every
u ∈ JµK \ JνK, the restriction tµ\ν,j|H(u) is (lj)+κ-standard. By Lemmas 6.18
and 6.13, we deduce that JµK \ JνK ⊂ NI,j−1 ∪ NI,j. Suppose for contradiction
that (JµK \ JνK) ∩ NI,j is not a vertical strip. Then (r, s, j), (r, s + 1, j) ∈ JµK \ JνK
for some r, s. Let u be the hand of H(r, s, j) and v be the foot of H(r, s + 1, j). By
Lemma 6.20(i), the node v is the right neighbor of u. By Lemma 6.18(b), we have
tµ\ν,j(u) = e > tµ\ν,j(v), which contradicts the standardness of tµ\ν,j. Hence,
(JµK \ JνK) ∩ NI,j is a vertical strip. A similar argument, using Lemmas 6.20(ii)
and 6.18(a), shows that (JµK \ JνK) ∩ NI,j−1 is a horizontal strip.

Conversely, suppose that JµK \ JνK is a j-bend. By Lemmas 6.21 and 6.20,
JµK \ JνK is a disjoint union of independent sets of two types: (1) consecutive right
extensions of hooks with arm length j − 1; (2) consecutive bottom extensions of
hooks with arm length j. In fact, we may assume that either JµK \ JνK is of type
(1) or JµK \ JνK is of type (2). If JµK \ JνK is of type (1), i.e. JµK \ JνK is a union
H1 ⊔· · ·⊔Hm of hooks with arm length j −1, then by Lemma 6.18(a), tµ\ν,j(v) = e
for any v which is a foot of Ha for a = 1, . . . , m. So tµ\ν,j is standard if tµ\ν,j|Ha
is standard for all a. Hence we may assume that m = 1. But in this case tµ\ν,j is
easily seen to be standard using Lemma 6.18(a) one more time. The case where
JµK \ JνK is of type (2) is similar.

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

Recall the set Λcol(n, d) of colored compositions deﬁned by (3.7) and the set

CT(µ; λ, c) of colored tableaux of shape µ and type (λ, c) from §6.2.

Corollary 6.23. Let µ ∈ Pρ,d, µ = quot(µ) and (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d). Then
|Std(µ \ ρ, l(λ, c)+κ)| = |CT(µ; λ, c)|.

Proof. Recall that l(λ, c) = lc1(λ1) . . . lcn−1(λn−1)lcn(λn). We have

lc1(λ1) . . . lcn−1(λn−1) = l(λ′, c′)

for λ′ = (λ1, . . . , λn−1) and c′ = (c1, . . . , cn−1). Then

|Std(µ \ ρ, l(λ, c)+κ)| = XJρK⊆JνK⊆JµK

|Std(ν \ ρ, l(λ′, c′)+κ)||Std(µ \ ν, lcn(λn))|.

If |Std(ν \ ρ, l(λ′, c′)+κ)| 6= 0, then cont(ν) = cont(ρ) + (d − λn)δ, whence by
Lemma 5.4, we have ν ∈ Pρ,d−λn. Arguing by induction on n, for such ν we
have |Std(ν \ ρ, l(λ′, c′)+κ)| = |CT(ν; λ′, c′)|, where ν = quot(ν). Moreover, by
Lemma 6.22, we have

|Std(µ \ ν, lcn(λn))| =(cid:26) 1 if JµK \ JνK is a cn-bend,

0 otherwise.

The result follows.

(cid:3)

6.4. Counting colored tableaux. In view of Lemma 6.8 and Corollary 6.23,
we can understand the dimensions of γλ,cCρ,dγλ′,c′
for (λ, c), (λ′, c′) ∈ Λcol(n, d)
by counting appropriate colored tableaux. The ﬁrst main goal of this subsection
is a formula for |CT(µ; λ, c)|.

Recall that J = {1, . . . , e − 1} = I \ {0}. For j ∈ J, we deﬁne

Inc(j) := {j, j − 1} ⊆ I.

Remark 6.24. The notation Inc(j) is motivated by the following considera-
tions. The irreducible semicuspidal Rδ,F-modules are exactly the irreducible Rδ,F-
modules which factor through RΛ0
δ,F is a
Brauer tree algebra of type Ae with vertices I and edges in natural bijection with
J, so that Inc(j) is just the set of vertices incident to the edge j.

δ,F, see [K2, Lemma 5.1]. The algebra RΛ0

Let Char :=Lt∈Z≥0

ZIrr(St) be the Z-module of all formal Z-linear combina-
tions of irreducible characters of St for t = 0, 1, . . . . We have the inner product
h·, ·i on Char such that on each summand it is the standard inner product on
(generalized) characters and ZIrr(St) is orthogonal to ZIrr(Su) for t 6= u. Let

CharI :=Oi∈I

with the induced inner product. For every µ = (µ(0), . . . , µ(e−1)) ∈ P I , we deﬁne

χµ := χµ(0)

⊗ · · · ⊗ χµ(e−1)

where χµ denotes the irreducible character of St corresponding to the partition
µ ∈ P(t).

Let S, T be ﬁnite sets and m, l ∈ Z>0. We denote by M(S, T ) the set of all

we set

We write M(m, T ) := M([1, m], T ), M(S, m) := M(S, [1, m]), etc. Given µ ∈

µM(m, T ) := {A ∈ M(m, T ) | αr(A) = µr for all r ∈ [1, m]},
M(S, m)µ := {A ∈ M(S, m) | βr(A) = µr for all r ∈ [1, m]},

Let (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d). We deﬁne

|CT(µ; λ, c)| = hχ(λ,c), χµi.

Proof. We apply induction on n = 1, 2, . . . , the induction base being immediate
from the deﬁnitions. Let n > 1. Set λ′ = (λ1, . . . , λn−1) ∈ Λ(n − 1) and c′ =
(c1, . . . , cn−1). We denote ((λn),(cn))M(1, I) by (λn,cn)M(1, I). For a matrix A′ ∈

(λ,c)M(n, I) the vertical concatenation of A′ and B. Then

(λ′,c′)M(n − 1, I) and a one-row matrix B ∈ (λn,cn)M(1, I) we denote by(cid:18)A′

For (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d) and (ω, b) ∈ Λcol(d, d) as above, we deﬁne the set

Lemma 6.28. For any (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d) and (ω, b) ∈ Λcol(d, d), we have

Proof. Consider the map θ : (λ,c)M(n, d)(ω,b) → M(n, I) × M(I, d) deﬁned as
follows. Given T = (T 0, . . . , T e−1) ∈ (λ,c)M(n, d)(ω,b), we set θ(T) = (A, B)
where A = (ar,i) ∈ M(n, I) and B = (bi,s) ∈ M(I, d) are given by ar,i := αr(T i)
and bi,s := βs(T i). Clearly, the image of θ is contained in (λ,c)M(n, I, d)(ω,b).

Let (A, B) ∈ (λ,c)M(n, I, d)(ω,b). Then the preimage θ−1(A, B) consists of
all tuples (T 0, . . . , T e−1) of matrices in M(n, d) such that αr(T i) = ar,i and
βs(T i) = bi,s for all i ∈ I, r ∈ [1, n] and s ∈ [1, d]. So, denoting

Si := {T ∈ M(n, d) | αr(T ) = ar,i, βs(T ) = bi,s for all r ∈ [1, n], s ∈ [1, d]}

for any i ∈ I, we have |θ−1(A, B)| =Qi∈I |Si|.
a bijection is given by assigning to each such partition X =Fn

To compute |Si| for a ﬁxed i ∈ I, let X = {s ∈ [1, d] | bi,s = 1}, so that
|X| = αi(B) = βi(A). Then the set of partitions of X into a disjoint union of
subsets Xr, r ∈ [1, n], with |Xr| = ar,i for each r, is in bijection with the set Si:
r=1 Xr the matrix

T = (tr,s) given by

tr,s =(1 if s ∈ Xr,

0 otherwise.

Therefore, |Si| = |Sβi(A) : SA,i|, proving the lemma.

Theorem 6.29. For any (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d) and b ∈ J d, we have

where the ﬁrst equality comes from Lemma 6.8, the second equality uses Corol-
lary 6.23 and Lemma 5.3, the third equality uses Lemma 6.26, the fourth equality
holds since the elements χµ form an orthonormal basis of CharI , and the ﬁnal

Corollary 6.30. Let (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d). For all j ∈ J, set dj = P1≤r≤n

Then

cr=j

dim(γλ,cCρ,dγω) =( |Sd : Sλ| 3d1+de−1 4Pe−2

|Sd : Sλ| 2d1

j=2 dj

if e > 2,
if e = 2.

Proof. In this paragraph we ﬁx b ∈ J d. Let Yb be the set of all maps ϕ : [1, d] →
[1, n] × I such that (1) |ϕ−1({r} × I)| = λr for all r ∈ [1, n]; (2) for all s ∈ [1, d],
if ϕ(s) = (r, i), then i ∈ Inc(cr) ∩ Inc(bs). Observe that there is a bijection
∼−→ Yb such that f (T)(s) is the unique (r, i) ∈ [1, n] × I such
f : (λ,c)M(n, d)(ω,b)
that ti

r,s = 1, if we write T = (T 0, . . . , T e−1) with T i = (ti

r,s).

Now, let Y := {(ϕ, b) | b ∈ J d, ϕ ∈ Yb}. By Theorem 6.29 and (6.7), we have

such that |Ωr| = λr for all r. Note that |W | = |Sd : Sλ|.

We deﬁne the map ξ : Y → W by setting ξ(ϕ, b) to be the partition [1, d] =

dim(γλ,cCρ,dγω) = |Y |. Let W be the set of all set partitions [1, d] =Fr∈[1,n] Ωr
Fr∈[1,n] ϕ−1({r} × I). To complete the proof, we ﬁx a set partition Ω : [1, d] =
Fr∈[1,n] Ωr in W and compute |ξ−1(Ω)|. Given j ∈ J, set Inc2(j) := {(i, l) ∈

I × J | i ∈ Inc(j) ∩ Inc(l)}. Note that

Inc2(j) =

{(j, j), (j, j + 1), (j − 1, j), (j − 1, j − 1)}
{(1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1)}

{(0, 1), (1, 1)}

if 1 < j < e − 1,
if j = 1 and e > 2,

if j = 1 and e = 2.

Note that ξ−1(Ω) consists of all pairs (ϕ, b) where ϕ : [1, d] → [1, n] × I and
b ∈ J d are such that for any r ∈ J × [1, n] and any s ∈ Ωr we have ϕ(s) = (r, i)
with (i, bs) ∈ Inc2(cr). So

|ξ−1(Ω)| = Yr∈[1,n] Ys∈Ωr

|Inc2(cr)| =Yj∈J

and the corollary follows.

Recall the algebra Wd and the right Wd-modules Mλ,c deﬁned in §3.1. Com-

bining Lemma 3.12 and Corollary 6.30, we obtain:

Corollary 6.31. For all (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d), we have dim(γλ,cCρ,dγω) = dim Mλ,c.

Corollary 6.32. We have dim(γωCρ,dγω) = d!(4e − 6)d = dim Wd.

Proof. This can be derived from the algebra isomorphism in [Ev, Theorem 3.4].
We give a more direct proof for the reader’s convenience. By (3.3), we have

BLOCKS OF SYMMETRIC GROUPS AND SEMICUSPIDAL KLR ALGEBRAS

33

dim Z = 4e − 6, and the second equality follows. For any c ∈ J d and j ∈ J, set
dj(c) := |{r ∈ [1, d] | cr = j}|. For e > 2, we compute:
dim(γω,cCρ,dγω)

dim(γωCρ,dγω) = Xc∈J d
= d!Xc∈J d

3d1(c)+de−1(c)4d2(c)+···+de−2(c)

= d!(3 + 4(e − 3) + 3)d = d!(4e − 6)d,

where the second equality is due to Corollary 6.30. For e = 2, the same compu-
tation yields dim(γωCρ,dγω) = d!2d = d!(4e − 6)d.
(cid:3)

7. The semicuspidal algebra

As usual, d ∈ Z>0 is ﬁxed. Recall the semicuspidal algebra ˆCdδ from §4.5. In
this section we prove some results on the structure of ˆCdδ. These results are used
in Section 8 to study the quotient Cρ,d of ˆCdδ in the context of a RoCK block,
cf. (5.17).

7.1. Preliminary results on the semicuspidal algebra. We have the para-
bolic subalgebra

ˆCωδ

∼= ˆCδ ⊗ · · · ⊗ ˆCδ ⊆ ˆCdδ

with the identity element 1ωδ, cf. Lemma 4.33.

Lemma 7.1. We have:

(i) The algebra 1ωδ ˆCdδ1ωδ is non-negatively graded.
(ii) 1ωδ ˆC >0

ωδ = 1ωδ ˆCdδ1ωδ ˆC >0
ωδ .

dδ 1ωδ = 1ωδ ˆCdδ ˆC >0

Proof. (i) follows from [Ev, Lemma 6.9(iii)]. The second equality in (ii) is obvious
and the ﬁrst one follows from [Ev, Lemma 6.9(i)(ii)].
(cid:3)

For j = (j1, . . . , jd) ∈ J d, we deﬁne

ej := 1lj1 ...ljd ∈ Rdδ.

(7.2)

In particular, for j ∈ J, we interpret ej as 1lj . In fact, the idempotent ej is also

known as γω,j, cf. (6.6), (6.7). So we have γω =Pj∈J d ej ∈ Rdδ.

Following [KM3], we consider the Rδ-modules ∆δ,j := ˆCδej for every j ∈ J.
Note that Rδ and hence ˆCδ is non-negatively graded. Recalling the modules
Lδ,j with basis {vi | i ∈ I δ,j} from §4.5, the following is immediate from [KM3,
Proposition 4.13]:

Lemma 7.3. Let j ∈ J. Then ∆δ,j is non-negatively graded and there is an
isomorphism of Rδ-modules

∆δ,j/∆>0
δ,j

∼−→ Lδ,j, ej + ∆>0

δ,j 7→ vlj .

Lemma 7.4. For any j ∈ J d, we have an isomorphism of Rdδ-modules

ˆCdδej

∼−→ ∆δ,j1 ◦ · · · ◦ ∆δ,jd, ej 7→ 1ωδ ⊗ ej1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ejd.

Proof. This follows from Lemma 4.32.

Let j ∈ J d. We consider the following submodule of the ˆCdδ-module ˆCdδej:

Nj := ˆCdδ( ˆC >0

(7.5)

Lemma 7.6. For any j ∈ J d, we have an isomorphism of Rdδ-modules
∼
−→ Lδ,j1 ◦ · · · ◦ Lδ,jd, ej + Nj 7→ 1ωδ ⊗ vlj1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ vljd .

ˆCdδej/Nj

Proof. By Lemmas 4.25, 7.3 and 7.4, there is a surjective Rdδ-module homomor-
phism as in the statement of the lemma. That the homomorphism is injective
follows from Lemmas 4.33 and 7.3 again.
(cid:3)
Lemma 7.7. If j ∈ J d, then ej ˆC 0

ωδej = Zej.

Proof. Clearly, it suﬃces to prove the lemma in the case d = 1. For any word
in i ∈ I δ, the entries i1, . . . , ie are distinct. Hence, by Theorem 4.13, we have
ejRδej = Z[y1, . . . , ye]ej, and the lemma follows.

Note that the sign here is opposite to the one in [KM3], which is technically more
convenient for us, but does not aﬀect the result below.

Theorem 7.12. We have:

(i) There is an injective algebra homomorphism Θ : Wd → γω ˆCdδγω with

for all j ∈ J d, 1 ≤ u < d, 1 ≤ t ≤ d, and all admissible k, j ∈ J, where
the signs depend on k and j.

(ii) For each a ∈ {0, 1}, the map Θ restricts to a Z-module isomorphism of

graded components W a

∼−→ γω ˆC a

(iii) The algebra γω ˆCdδγω is generated by Θ(Wd) together with y1γω.

Proof. Part (i) follows from [KM3, Theorem 5.9] together with the fact that
aj,kak,j = ±cej for all neighbors k, j ∈ J, as observed in the proof of [KM3,
Theorem 4.17]. Parts (ii) and (iii) follow from [KM3, Theorem 5.9] and the easy
facts that the aﬃne zigzag algebra is non-negatively graded and is generated
by the ﬁnite zigzag algebra isomorphic to Wd and a homogeneous element z1 of
degree 2, see [KM3, Section 3].
(cid:3)

Considering scalar extensions to a ﬁeld k, we also have the following result.

Here and in the sequel, we denote γω := γω ⊗ 1 ∈ ˆCdδ,k,

Lemma 7.13. Let k be a ﬁeld with char k = 0 or char k > d. The left ˆCdδ,k-
module ˆCdδ,kγω is a projective generator for the algebra ˆCdδ,k.

Proof. By [KM2, Lemma 6.22], the ˆCdδ,k-module ∆◦d
projective generator. By (7.8), we have ∆◦d
follows.

δ ⊗Z k ∼= (∆δ ⊗Z k)◦d is a

7.3. Imaginary tensor spaces. Let j ∈ J. Following [KM1], we refer to Td,j :=
L◦d
δ,j as the imaginary tensor space of color j. In [KM1, (4.2.9)], an action of the
symmetric group Sd on Td,j with Rdδ-endomorphisms is deﬁned as follows:

(1ωδ ⊗ v⊗d

lj ) · st = (ζjψwt + 1dδ)1ωδ ⊗ v⊗d
lj

(1 ≤ t < d).

Comparing with (7.11), we see that

(1ωδ ⊗ v⊗d

lj .

(7.14)

As in [KM1, §5.2], we deﬁne

Zd,j := {v ∈ Td,j | v · g = (−1)ℓ(g)v for all g ∈ Sd}.

Recall the Gelfand-Graev idempotent γd,j from (6.5).

Lemma 7.15.

[KM1, Lemma 6.4.1(ii)] We have Zd,j = Rdδγd,jTd,j.

More generally, ﬁx (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d) for some n ∈ Z>0. Deﬁne the semicuspi-

dal Rdδ-module

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

By the n = 1 case considered above, we have the right action of Sλ1 ×· · ·× Sλn =
⊠· · ·⊠Tλn,cn with Rλδ-endomorphisms. By functoriality of induction,
Sλ on Tλ1,c1
this induces a right action of Sλ on Tλ,c with Rdδ-endomorphisms. Deﬁne

Zλ,c := {v ∈ Tλ,c | v · g = (−1)ℓ(g)v for all g ∈ Sλ}.

Recall the idempotent γλ,c from (6.3), and note that γλ,c = γλ,c1λδ.
Lemma 7.16. We have Zλ,c = Rdδ(γλ,c ⊗ (Tλ1,c1

⊠ · · · ⊠ Tλn,cn)).

Proof. By Lemma 7.15, we have

Let Θ : Wd → γω ˆCdδγω be the algebra homomorphism of Theorem 7.12. Re-

Lemma 7.23. For every g ∈ Sλ, we have eλ,cΘ(g) = Θ(g)eλ,c.

Proof. Since we have eλ,cg = geλ,c in Wd, the lemma follows from (7.21).

Proof. Throughout the proof, we identify Tλ,c with ˆTλ,c/Nλ,c via the isomorphism
(7.20), so

1λδ ⊗ Tλ1,c1

⊠ · · · ⊠ Tλn,cn = ( ˆCλδeλ,c + Nλ,c)/Nλ,c

and we have a right action of Sλ on ˆTλ,c/Nλ,c. The space Zλ,c of signed invariants
under this action becomes a ˆCdδ-submodule of ˆTλ,c/Nλ,c, and by Lemma 7.16,
we have Zλ,c = ( ˆCdδγλ,c ˆCλδeλ,c + Nλ,c)/Nλ,c.

Let 1 ≤ t < d satisfy st ∈ Sλ, and moreover, let q ∈ [1, n] be deﬁned by the

condition that st lies in the Sλq -component of Sλ. By (7.14), we have

(eλ,c + Nλ,c) · st = −ζcq ˆrteλ,c + Nλ,c.

Let v = veλ,c ∈ ˆTλ,c. Then

(v + Nλ,c) · st = −ζcq vˆrteλ,c + Nλ,c = −ζcq vΘ(st)eλ,c + Nλ,c
= −ζcq veλ,cΘ(st) + Nλ,c = −ζcq vΘ(st) + Nλ,c,

using Lemma 7.23 for the third equality. So for any g ∈ Sλ, we have

(−1)ℓ(g)(v + Nλ,c) · g = ελ,c(g)vΘ(g) + Nλ,c.

It follows that ˜Zλ,c is the
In particular, Nλ,cΘ(g) ⊆ Nλ,c for all g ∈ Sλ.
preimage of Zλ,c under the canonical projection ˆTλ,c ։ ˆTλ,c/Nλ,c. So ˜Zλ,c =
ˆCdδγλ,c ˆCλδeλ,c + Nλ,c by the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof.

7.4. The structure of γλ,c ˆCdδγω. In view of (4.23) to i ∈ I θ
div we associate
ˆi ∈ I θ. Throughout this subsection we drop the hats and usually write i for ˆi.
For example, [lj(d) is written simply as lj(d).

Let hd ∈ Sed be deﬁned by hd((t − 1)e + q) = (q − 1)d + t for all t = 1, . . . , d
and q = 1, . . . , e.
In other words, hd is the shortest element of Sde such that
hd((lj)d) = lj(d) for all j ∈ J. Let w0,d ∈ Sed be the longest element of S(de),
i.e. w0,d((q − 1)d + t) = (q − 1)d + d + 1 − t for all q = 1, . . . , e and t = 1, . . . , d.
Let j ∈ J and note that ejd = 1(lj )d. We set

ud,j := ψw0,dψhdejd ∈ ˆCdδ.

More generally, ﬁx n ∈ Z>0 and (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d). Recalling (7.17), we deﬁne

hλ := (hλ1 , . . . , hλn ) ∈ Seλ1 × · · · × Seλn = Seλ ≤ Sed,

w0,λ := (w0,λ1, . . . , w0,λn) ∈ Seλ1 × · · · × Seλn = Seλ ≤ Sed,

where we have used the identiﬁcation from Lemma 4.33.

In view of (4.20) we get:

Lemma 7.26. We have uλ,c ∈ γλ,c ˆCdδeλ,c.

Recall the integer aλ deﬁned by (6.4). The following is easily deduced from

the deﬁnitions:
Lemma 7.27. The element uλ,c ∈ ˆCdδ is homogeneous of degree aλ.
Lemma 7.28. Let j ∈ J and i = i(1) . . . i(d) for some i(1), . . . , i(d) ∈ I δ.
g ∈ (de)D (ed) is such that gi = lj(d), then g = hd and i(1) = · · · = i(d) = lj.
Proof. If i ∈ I δ, the letters of i are distinct. The result follows from this obser-
vation together with the deﬁnition of (de)D (ed).

sc and i = i(1) . . . i(d). If g ∈ λ{e}

1 , . . . , lλn

Proof. We apply the induction on n, the case n = 1 being Lemma 7.28. Let
n > 1. By the inductive hypothesis, we may assume that λn > 0. Note that
l(λ, c) = l(λ′, c′)lcn(λn), where λ′ = (λ1, . . . , λn−1) and c′ = (c1, . . . , cn−1). Let
lcn = (l1, . . . , le) so that lcn(λn) = (lλn
e ). We know that l1 = 0 and
i(t)
1 = 0 for t = 1, . . . , d, see Corollary 4.29. Note that the positions (d − λn)e + q
for q = 1, . . . , λn in l(λ, c) correspond to the ﬁrst λn positions in lcn(λn), and so
they are occupied with 0s. So there exist 1 ≤ a1, . . . , aλn ≤ d such that g sends the
ﬁrst position of the word i(aq ) to the qth position of lcn(λn), i.e. g((aq − 1)e+ 1) =
(d − λn)e + q for q = 1, . . . , λn. Since g ∈ λ{e}
D, we have a1 < · · · < aλn. Since
g ∈ D (ed), it sends the remaining positions in the words i(a1), . . . , i(aλn ) to the
remaining positions of lcn(λn), i.e. to the last λn(e − 1) positions of l(λ, c). It
follows that i(a1) = · · · = i(aλn ) = lcn.

Let b′ ∈ Bd be the block permutation which moves the blocks i(a1), . . . , i(aλn )
to the end in the same order and preserves the order of the remaining blocks.

Let g′ = g(b′)−1. We claim that ℓ(g′) = ℓ(g) − ℓ(b′). To prove this, it suﬃces to
show that g(r) > g(s) for all 1 ≤ r < s ≤ ed such that b′(r) > b′(s), which is
clear since for any such r, s, the element r is in one of the blocks corresponding
to i(a1), . . . , i(aλn ), whereas s is not.

We have g′ ∈ λ{e}

because g = g′b′ ∈ λ{e}
the result follows by the inductive assumption.

Lemma 7.30. For any y ∈ Z[y1, . . . , yde] there exists y′ ∈ Z[y1, . . . , yde] such that
1l(λ,c)yψhλ = 1l(λ,c)ψhλy′.

Proof. This follows from the observation that the Khovanov–Lauda diagram [KL,
§2.1] of 1l(λ,c)ψhλ does not have any crossings of two strings with the same label
and the relations (4.7), (4.8).
(cid:3)

Lemma 7.31. For any (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d), we have:

(i) γλ,c ˆCdδ1ωδ = uλ,c ˆCdδ1ωδ = uλ,cγω ˆCdδ1ωδ;
(ii) γλ,c ˆCλδ1ωδ = uλ,c ˆCωδ.

Proof. By Lemma 7.26, uλ,cγω ˆCdδ1ωδ = uλ,c ˆCdδ1ωδ ⊆ γλ,c ˆCdδ1ωδ, so for (i) it
only remains to prove the inclusion γλ,c ˆCdδ1ωδ ⊆ uλ,cγω ˆCdδ1ωδ. Moreover, for
(ii) we may assume that n = 1 and prove only that γd,j ˆCdδ1ωδ ⊆ ud,j ˆCωδ.

The word l(λ, c) ∈ I dδ is the concatenation of ne words of the form (is) ∈ I sαi
for various i ∈ I and s ∈ Z≥0. We denote the corresponding integer multiples
sαi ∈ Q+ of simple roots by θ1, . . . , θne, listed in the order of concatenation, i.e.
θe(t−1)+q = λtαlct,q for all t = 1, . . . , n and q = 1, . . . , e, cf. (6.1). By Lemma 4.18,
we have

ˆCdδ1ωδ = Xg∈λ{e}

D (ed )

D (ed) such that the summand U := γλ,cRθ1,...,θneψg ˆCωδ
Consider an element g ∈ λ{e}
on the right hand side is non-zero. Then there exists i ∈ I dδ such that gi = l(λ, c)
and 1i1ωδ 6= 0 in ˆCωδ, whence i = i(1) . . . i(d) for some i(1), . . . , i(d) ∈ I δ
sc. Hence,
by Lemma 7.29, we have g = hλb for some b ∈ Bd. Moreover, in the case when
n = 1, needed for part (ii), we have b = 1 by Lemma 7.28. We may assume that
preferred reduced decompositions for the elements of Sde are chosen in such a
way that ψg = ψhλψb, so U = γλ,cRθ1,...,θneψhλψb ˆCωδ.

Let P ⊆ Rdδ be the subalgebra generated by y1, . . . , yde. Then

U = γλ,cRθ1,...,θneψhλψb ˆCωδ

where we have used Lemma 4.21 for the second equality, Lemma 7.30 for the third
equality, the deﬁnition of uλ,c and Lemma 7.26 for the fourth equality. Part (i)
now follows since uλ,cγωP ψb ˆCωδ ⊆ uλ,cγω ˆCdδ1ωδ, whereas part (ii) follows since
ψb = 1 in the case n = 1 and P ˆCωδ = ˆCωδ.
(cid:3)

Multiplying the equality in Lemma 7.31(i) by γω on the right, we obtain

γλ,c ˆCdδγω = uλ,cγω ˆCdδγω. In particular:
Corollary 7.32. As a right γω ˆCdδγω-module, γλ,c ˆCdδγω is generated by uλ,c.

Note that by Lemmas 7.1 and 7.27 and Corollary 7.32, we have γλ,c ˆCdδγω ⊆

dδ

. Recall the left ˆCdδ-modules Nj deﬁned by (7.5).

ˆC ≥aλ
Lemma 7.33. For any (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d) and j ∈ J d, we have γλ,cNj ⊆ ˆC >aλ
Proof. Recall that uλ,c = uλ,cγω. We have

dδ

.

γλ,cNj = γλ,c ˆCdδ( ˆC >0

ωδ )ej = uλ,c ˆCdδ( ˆC >0

ωδ )ej = uλ,ceλ,c ˆCdδ( ˆC >0

ωδ )ej ,

where the second equality comes from Lemma 7.31(i) since 1ωδ is the identity
element of ˆCωδ, and the last equality holds by Lemma 7.26. Now eλ,c ˆCdδ1ωδ is
non-negatively graded by Lemma 7.1(i), and deg(uλ) = aλ by Lemma 7.27, so
the lemma follows.
(cid:3)

Recalling (7.18) and the homomorphism Θ from Theorem 7.12, deﬁne the ˆCdδ-

submodule

ˆZλ,c := {v ∈ ˆTλ,c | vΘ(g) = ελ,c(g)v for all g ∈ Sλ} ⊆ ˆTλ,c.

Clearly, ˆZλ,c ⊆ ˜Zλ,c, cf. (7.22).
Lemma 7.34. We have uλ,c ∈ ˆZλ,c.
Proof. By Lemma 7.26 and the deﬁnition of uλ,c, we have uλ,c ∈ γλ,c ˆCλδeλ,c.
Hence, by Lemma 7.24, we get uλ,c ∈ ˜Zλ,c. So for any g ∈ Sλ, we have uλ,cΘ(g)−
ελ,c(g)uλ,c ∈ γλ,cNλ,c. By Lemma 7.27, uλ,cΘ(g) − ελ,c(g)uλ,c is homogeneous of
degree aλ. But γλ,cN aλ
λ,c = 0 by Lemma 7.33, so uλ,cΘ(g) − ελ,c(g)uλ,c = 0. (cid:3)
Lemma 7.35. Let (λ, c), (µ, b) ∈ Λcol(n, d). If v ∈ γµ,b ˆZλ,c is a homogeneous
element of degree aµ, then v = xuλ,c for some x ∈ γµ,b ˆCdδγλ,c.
Proof. By Lemma 7.24, we have v ∈ γµ,b ˆCdδγλ,c ˆCλδeλ,c+γµ,bNλ,c. By Lemma 7.33,
γµ,bN aµ
λ,c = 0, so v ∈ γµ,b ˆCdδγλ,c ˆCλδeλ,c. Hence, by Lemma 7.31(ii), we have
v ∈ γµ,b ˆCdδuλ,c ˆCωδeλ,c. We know that ˆCωδ is non-negatively graded, so we
have v = v1 + v2 for some homogeneous elements v1 ∈ γµ,b ˆCdδuλ,c ˆC 0
ωδeλ,c and
v2 ∈ γµ,b ˆCdδuλ,c ˆC >0
ωδ eλ,c, with deg(v1) = deg(v2) = deg(v) = aµ. By deﬁni-
tion (7.19) of Nλ,c, we have v2 ∈ γµ,bNλ,c, whence v2 = 0 by Lemma 7.33. On the
other hand, by Lemma 7.7, we have uλ,c ˆC 0
ωδeλ,c = Zuλ,c, so v = v1 ∈ γµ,b ˆCdδuλ,c,
and the result follows by Lemma 7.26.

8.1. Identifying Wd with γωCρ,dγω. Recall from (5.17) that we have the nat-
ural surjection

Π : ˆCρ,d → ˆCdδ/ ker Ω = Cρ,d.

This yields the surjections

Πω : γω ˆCdδγω → γωCρ,dγω, Πλ,c : γλ,c ˆCdδγω → γλ,cCρ,dγω

(8.1)

for (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d). For any x ∈ ˆCdδ, we often denote by x its image Π(x) in
Cρ,d.

We deﬁne the algebra homomorphism

Ξ := Πω ◦ Θ : Wd → γωCρ,dγω

(8.2)

where Θ : Wd → γω ˆCρ,dγω is as in Theorem 7.12. Our aim is to prove that Ξ is
an isomorphism by generalizing the arguments of [Ev, Section 7], where a similar
statement is proved over a ﬁeld containing an element of quantum characteristic
e. We begin with the case where d = 1, when Wd = Z.

Lemma 8.3. For d = 1 and each a ∈ {0, 1}, the map Ξ restricts to a Z-module
isomorphism of graded components Za ∼−→ γωC a

ρ,1γω.

Proof. By Theorem 7.12(ii), Θ restricts to an isomorphism Za ∼−→ γω ˆC a
whence Ξ restricts to a surjection Za → γωC a
Lemmas 5.18 and 6.19, we have that Za and γωC a
same rank, which completes the proof.

ρ,1γω,
ρ,1γω. Moreover, by (3.3) and
ρ,1γω are free Z-modules of the
(cid:3)

Lemma 8.4. Let d = 1 and j ∈ J. Then C 2

ρ,1ej = Z(y1 − ye)ej.

ρ,1ej = ejC 2

Proof. By Lemmas 5.18 and 6.19, the Z-module C 2
ρ,1ej is free of rank
1. It suﬃces to prove that y := (y1 − ye)ej ⊗ 1 generates C 2
ρ,1,kej over any ﬁeld k,
i.e. that y 6= 0 for any ﬁeld k, cf. Remark 5.21. This is proved in [Ev, Proposition
7.2] for any ﬁeld k containing an element of quantum characteristic e, in particular
for e = 2. So we may assume that e > 2. By Corollary 5.22, the algebra Cρ,1,k
has a symmetrizing form F of degree −2. Since e > 2, the element j has a
neighbor k ∈ J. In the rest of the proof, we write x := x ⊗ 1 ∈ Cρ,1,k for x ∈ Cρ,1.
Recalling the elements of ˆCδ introduced in §7.2, note that ak,j 6= 0 in C 1
ρ,1,k by
ρ,1,k such that F (xak,j) 6= 0.
Lemma 8.3. So there must exist an element x ∈ C 1
Using Theorem 7.12 and Lemma 8.3 again, we may assume that x = Ξ(aj,k), and
hence (y1 − ye)ej = ±Ξ(cej) = ±Ξ(aj,kak,j) = ±aj,kak,j 6= 0.
(cid:3)

Now we return to the case when d ∈ Z>0 is arbitrary. By Lemma 4.33, we

have an embedding

ι : ˆCδ → ˆCdδ, x 7→ x ⊗ 1(d−1)δ ∈ ˆCδ ⊗ ˆC(d−1)δ = ˆCδ,(d−1)δ ⊆ ˆCdδ.

(8.5)

In view of Theorem 7.12(i), for any j ∈ J, we have

Θ(ej[1]) = ι(ej ).

(8.6)

Corollary 8.7. The element y1γω ∈ Cρ,d belongs to the image of Ξ.

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

Proof. We have the (non-unital) algebra homomorphisms Ω1 : ˆCδ → RΛ0
and Ωd : ˆCdδ → RΛ0

cont(ρ)+δ
cont(ρ)+dδ deﬁned as in (5.12). Recall the algebra homomorphism

ζ := ζcont(ρ)+δ, (d−1)δ : RΛ0

cont(ρ)+δ → RΛ0

cont(ρ)+δ, (d−1)δ ⊆ RΛ0

cont(ρ)+dδ

deﬁned by (4.19). It follows easily from the deﬁnitions that ζ ◦ Ω1 = Ωd ◦ ι : ˆCδ →
RΛ0

cont(ρ)+dδ, whence ι(ker Ω1) ⊆ ker Ωd.
Let j ∈ J. Identifying ˆCδ ⊗ ˆC(d−1)δ with ˆCδ,(d−1)δ ⊆ ˆCdδ as usual, we have in

ˆCdδ:

y1ej ⊗ 1(d−1)δ = ι(y1ej) ∈ ι(Z(y1 − ye)ej + ker Ω1)

= Z(y1 − ye)ej ⊗ 1(d−1)δ + ι(ker Ω1)
⊆ Z(y1 − ye)ej ⊗ 1(d−1)δ + ker Ωd,

where we have used Lemma 8.4 for the ﬁrst inclusion. Multiplying by γω, we get

y1γω =Xj∈J

(y1ej ⊗ 1(d−1)δ)γω ∈Xj∈J
=Xj∈J

(Z(y1 − ye)ej ⊗ 1(d−1)δ)γω + ker Ωd

±Θ(c[1]ej[1]) + ker Ωd,

(8.8)

where the last equality holds by Theorem 7.12(i) and (8.6). Now the lemma
follows on applying Π.
(cid:3)

Theorem 8.9. The map Ξ : Wd → γωCρ,dγω is an isomorphism of graded alge-
bras.

Proof. By Theorem 7.12(iii), the algebra γωCρ,dγω is generated by Ξ(Wd) to-
gether with the element y1γω. But y1γω ∈ Ξ(Wd) by Corollary 8.7, so Ξ is
surjective. By Corollary 6.32, the algebras Wd and γωCρ,dγω are Z-free of the
same rank, and the result follows.
(cid:3)

Lemma 8.10. Let k be a ﬁeld with char k = 0 or char k > d. The left module
Cρ,d,kγω is a projective generator for the algebra Cρ,d,k.

Proof. As Cρ,d,kγω is projective,
it is enough to show that for every simple
Cρ,d,k-module L we have γωL ∼= HomCρ,d,k(Cρ,d,kγω, L) 6= 0. But L may also
be viewed as a simple ˆCdδ,k-module via the natural surjection ˆCdδ,k ։ Cρ,d,k.
By Lemma 7.13, the module ˆCdδ,kγω is a projective generator for ˆCdδ,k, whence
γωL ∼= Hom ˆCdδ,k
(cid:3)
Corollary 8.11. The Cρ,d-module Cρ,dγω is faithful.

( ˆCdδ,kγω, L) 6= 0.

Proof. By Lemma 5.18, the algebra Cρ,d is Z-free, so it is enough to show that the
Cρ,d,Q-module Cρ,d,Qγω is faithful. By Lemma 8.10, this module is a projective
generator for Cρ,d,Q, and the result follows.

8.2. Identifying γλ,cCdδγω with Mλ,c. Let n ∈ Z>0 and (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d). By
Theorem 7.12, the right γω ˆCdδγω-module γλ,c ˆCdδγω becomes a right Wd-module
via the map Θ. Moreover, by Theorem 8.9, the right γωCρ,dγω-module γλ,cCρ,dγω
becomes a right Wd-module via the map Ξ. In other words:
(v ∈ γλ,c ˆCdδγω, z ∈ Wd),
(v ∈ γλ,cCρ,dγω, z ∈ Wd).

(8.13)
It is clear from the deﬁnitions that Πλ,c : γλ,c ˆCdδγω → γλ,cCρ,dγω is a surjective
homomorphism of Wd-modules.

vz := vΘ(z)

vz := vΞ(z)

(8.12)

Recall the colored permutation Wd-module Mλ,c with generator mλ,c = 1λ,c ⊗

eλ,c deﬁned by (3.11) and the element uλ,c ∈ γλ,cCdδγω introduced in §7.4.

Lemma 8.14. There is a degree-preserving Wd-module homomorphism

θλ,c : Mλ,c → q−aλγλ,c ˆCdδγω, mλ,c 7→ uλ,c.

Proof. By (7.21) and Lemma 7.26, we have uλ,cΘ(eλ,c) = uλ,ceλ,c = uλ,c. By
Lemma 7.34, for any g ∈ Sλ we have uλ,cΘ(g) = ελ,c(g)uλ,c. Using Lemma 7.27,
we deduce that there is a degree-preserving Wλ,c-module homomorphism altλ,c →
q−aλγλ,c ˆCdδγω, 1λ,c 7→ uλ,c. This map induces a Wd-module homomorphism θλ,c
as in the statement of the lemma.
(cid:3)

From now on, we write ¯uλ,c := Πλ,c(uλ,c) ∈ Cρ,d.

Theorem 8.15. For any (λ, c) ∈ Λcol(n, d), there is an isomorphism of graded
Wd-modules:

ηλ,c : Mλ,c

∼−→ q−aλγλ,cCρ,dγω, mλ,c 7→ ¯uλ,c.

Proof. Let θλ,c be as in Lemma 8.14. We have a homomorphism of Wd-modules

ηλ,c := Πλ,c ◦ θλ,c : Mλ,c → q−aλγλ,cCρ,dγω, mλ,c 7→ ¯uλ,c.

By Corollary 7.32, the right γωCρ,dγω-module q−aλγλ,cCρ,dγω is generated by
¯uλ,c. Using Theorem 8.9, we conclude that ηλ,c is surjective. By Corollary 6.31,
the Z-modules Mλ,c and q−aλγλ,cCρ,dγω are free of the same (ungraded) rank,
and the theorem follows.

¯uλ := ¯uλ,c0,

eλ := eλ,c0,

ANTON EVSEEV AND ALEXANDER KLESHCHEV

where θλ,c0 is the homomorphism of Lemma 8.14 and ηλ,c0 is the isomorphism of
Theorem 8.15.

Deﬁne the left Cρ,d-module

Γ(n, d) := Mλ∈Λ(n(e−1),d)

qaλCρ,df λ

and the algebra

E(n, d) := EndCρ,d(Γ(n, d))op.

(8.16)
Let λ, µ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d). We identify the (graded) Z-module qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ
with the Z-submodule of E(n, d) consisting of the endomorphisms that send the
summand qaµCρ,df µ to qaλCρ,df λ and send the other summands to zero. Specif-
ically, an element x ∈ qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ corresponds to the homomorphism given
by the right multiplication:

Thus,

qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ.

(8.17)

qaµCρ,df µ → qaλCρ,df λ, v 7→ vx.

E(n, d) = Mλ,µ∈Λ(n(e−1))

Let x ∈ qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ. Recalling the right Wd-module structure (8.13), we

have a Wd-module homomorphism

q−aλf λCρ,dγω → q−aµf µCρ,dγω, v 7→ xv.

Identifying q−aλf λCρ,dγω with M λ and q−aµf µCρ,dγω with M µ via the isomor-
phisms of Theorem 8.15, we obtain an element Φ(x) ∈ HomWd(M λ, M µ).
In
other words,

Φ(x) : M λ → M µ, v 7→ η−1

µ (xηλ(v))

(v ∈ M λ).

Recall from §3.2 that HomWd(M λ, M µ) is identiﬁed with ξµS Z(n, d)ξλ. The as-
signments x 7→ Φ(x) for all λ, µ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1)) and all x ∈ qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ extend
uniquely to a Z-linear map

Φ : E(n, d) → S Z(n, d).

Lemma 8.18. The map Φ : E(n, d) → S Z(n, d) is a homomorphism of graded
algebras.

Proof. That Φ is a homomorphism of ungraded algebras follows easily from the
deﬁnitions. Let x ∈ qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ be a homogeneous element for some λ, µ ∈
Λ(n(e − 1), d). Then, by deﬁnitions, Φ(x) : mλ 7→ mµz for some homogeneous
z ∈ Wd such that x¯uλ = ¯uµΞ(z) in q−aµf µCρ,dγω. Hence, Φ(x) is homogeneous
of degree

deg(z) = deg(Ξ(z)) = deg(x) − (aλ − aµ) + deg(¯uλ) − deg(¯uµ) = deg(x),

where the last equality is due to Lemma 7.27.

(cid:3)

Corollary 8.19. The algebra homomorphism Φ : E(n, d) → S Z(n, d) is injective.
Proof. If not, then there exist λ, µ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d) and 0 6= x ∈ f µCρ,df λ such
that xf λCρ,dγω = 0, whence xCρ,dγω = 0. But this is impossible by Corol-
lary 8.11.

Lemma 8.20. We have Φ(E(n, d)) ⊇ S Z(n, d)0.
Proof. Suppose that λ, µ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d) and h ∈ HomWd(M λ, M µ)0. Then
there exists z ∈ W 0
d such that h(mλ) = mµz. Hence, mµzeλ = mµz and mµzg =
ελ(g)mµz for all g ∈ Sλ. By Lemma 8.14, (8.12) and (7.21), it follows that the
element

has degree zero and satisﬁes v = veλ and vΘ(g) = ελ(g)v for all g ∈ Sλ. By
Lemma 7.35, there exists x ∈ f µ ˆCdδf λ such that v = xuλ. Applying the sur-
jection Π to this equality and writing ¯x := Π(x) ∈ qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ, we have
¯uµΞ(z) = ¯x¯uλ, cf. (8.2). But ¯uλ = ηλ(mλ) and ¯uµΞ(z) = ηµ(mµz), so the map
Φ(¯x) sends mλ to mµz. Thus, Φ(¯x) = h, so h ∈ Φ(E(n, d)). The lemma fol-
lows.

Recall the algebra homomorphisms iλ : Z → S Z(n, d) from (3.15).

Lemma 8.21. For any λ ∈ Λ((n − 1)(e − 1), d − 1), we have iλ(Z) ⊆ Φ(E(n, d)).
Proof. Let z ∈ ej Zek for some k, j ∈ J. Recall the embedding ι : ˆCδ → ˆCdδ
from (8.5). It follows from Theorem 7.12(i) and (8.6) that there exists x ∈ ej ˆCδek
such that Θ(z[1]) = ι(x). Note that

uˆλk = ek ⊗ uλ ∈ ˆCδ ⊗ ˆC(d−1)δ = ˆCδ,(d−1)δ ⊆ ˆCdδ,

and uˆλj is described similarly. Hence, ι(x)uˆλk = uˆλj ι(x) = uˆλj Θ(z[1]). Writing
¯x := Π(ι(x))f ˆλk

Π(ι(x)) ∈ f ˆλj

= f ˆλj

¯x¯uˆλk = ¯uˆλj ¯x = ¯uˆλj Ξ(z[1]),

So Φ(¯x) = iλ(z), and the lemma follows.

Lemma 8.22. For every ﬁeld k, the k-algebra E(n, d)k is symmetric.

Proof. By Corollary 5.22, the algebra Cρ,d,k is symmetric. It follows from (8.16)
that E(n, d)k ∼= EndCρ,d,k(Γ(n, d)k)op. Since Γ(n, d)k is a projective Cρ,d,k-module,
the lemma follows by [SY, Proposition IV.4.4].

Recall the subalgebra T Z(n, d) ⊆ S Z(n, d) from §3.2.

Theorem 8.23. Suppose that n ≥ d. Then we have an isomorphism of graded
algebras Φ : E(n, d) ∼−→ T Z(n, d).
Proof. By Lemma 8.18 and Corollary 8.19, the map Φ : E(n, d) → S Z(n, d) is
an injective homomorphism of graded algebras, so E(n, d) ∼= Φ(E(n, d)). By
Lemmas 8.20 and 8.21, we have T Z(n, d) ⊆ Φ(E(n, d)). By Lemma 8.22, for
every prime p, the algebra Φ(E(n, d)) ⊗Z Fp is symmetric. An application of
Theorem 3.17 completes the proof.
(cid:3)
Corollary 8.24. Let n ≥ d. Then E(n, d) ∼= DQ(n, d).

Example 8.25. Recall the idempotents ξλ ∈ S Z(n, d) deﬁned in §3.2 for any
λ ∈ Λ(n(e− 1), d). It follows from the deﬁnitions that for all λ, µ ∈ Λ(n(e− 1), d),
the homomorphism Φ maps the component qaλ−aµf µCρ,df λ of the decomposi-
tion (8.17) of E(n, d) into the component ξµS Z(n(e− 1), d)ξλ = HomWd(M λ, M µ)
of S Z(n, d). In this example, we consider the case when e = 2, d = 2, n = 2 and
λ = (2, 0), and we identify Φ(f λCρ,df λ) as an explicit subalgebra of EndW2(M λ).
Let x1, x2 ∈ EndW2(M λ) be the endomorphisms deﬁned by the properties that
x1(mλ) = mλ(c[1] + c[2]) and x2(mλ) = mλc[1]c[2]. Then {1 := ξλ, x1, x2} is
a Z-basis of the commutative algebra EndW2(M λ), and x2
1 = 2x2, x1x2 = 0.
Moreover, it is easy to see as in [EK, Example 4.27] that ξλT Z(n, d)ξλ is the
Z-span of {1, x1, 2x2}, so ξλT Z(n, d)ξλ is isomorphic to the truncated polynomial
algebra Z[z]/(z3), with x1 corresponding to z. Thus, Theorem 8.23 asserts, in
particular, that Φ(f λCρ,df λ) = Z1 ⊕ Zx1 ⊕ 2Zx2. This assertion can also be
veriﬁed by direct calculations using (1) the deﬁning relations of the aﬃne zigzag
algebra 10101 ˆC2δ10101, see [KM3, Deﬁnition 3.3]; and (2) the fact that y1γω =
y110101 = a(y1 − y2)10101 in Cρ,2 for some a ∈ Z, see (8.8).
8.4. Morita equivalences. Let A and B be graded Z-algebras. A graded functor
A-mod → B-mod is a functor F equipped with an equivalence between q ◦ F and
F◦q. A graded functor F is a graded equivalence if it is an equivalence of categories
(in the usual sense). The graded algebras A and B are graded Morita equivalent if
there is a graded equivalence between A-mod and B-mod. As noted for example
in [LVV, §II.5.3] the graded analogue of Morita theory holds. In particular, A is
graded Morita equivalent to B if and only if there exists a graded projective left
A-module P which is a projective generator and such that B ∼= EndA(P )op.

For a graded algebra A, recall the notation ℓ(A) from §2.3.

Lemma 8.26. Let A be a graded Z-algebra which is ﬁnitely generated as a Z-
module, and let ε ∈ A be a homogeneous idempotent. Suppose that for every
prime p we have ℓ(A¯Fp) = ℓ((ε ⊗ 1)A¯Fp(ε ⊗ 1)). Then the algebras A and εAε are
graded Morita equivalent.

Proof. We write ε := ε ⊗ 1 ∈ A¯Fp for each prime p. It suﬃces to show that the
left A-module Aε is a projective generator for A or, equivalently, that AεA = A.
Assume that AεA 6= A. Then there exists a prime p such that A¯FpεA¯Fp 6= A¯Fp.
If L is a composition factor of A¯Fp/A¯FpεA¯Fp, then εL = 0, which contradicts the
assumption that ℓ(A¯Fp) = ℓ(εA¯Fpε), for example by [G, Theorem 6.2(g)].
(cid:3)

Let λ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d).

It follows from the deﬁnitions in §6.1 that l(λ, c0)
is obtained from ˆl(λ, c0) by replacing each subword of the form im that is not
preceded by or followed by i with i(m). Therefore, for any λ, µ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d),
we either have f λ = f µ or f λf µ = f µf λ = 0. We have an equivalence relation
on Λ(n(e − 1), d), with λ being equivalent to µ if and only if f λ = f µ. Let
X ⊆ Λ(n(e − 1), d) be a set of representatives of equivalence classes. Deﬁne

f :=Pλ∈X f λ ∈ Cρ,d. Then f 2 = f is a homogeneous idempotent.

Lemma 8.27. The algebra E(n, d) is graded Morita equivalent to f Cρ,df .

Proof. Consider the left f Cρ,df -module

f Γ(n, d) = Mλ∈Λ(n(e−1),d)

qaλ f Cρ,df λ.

There is a surjective f Cρ,df -module homomorphism f Γ(n, d) → f Cρ,df which is
the identity on the summands f Cρ,df λ for λ ∈ X and zero on the other sum-
mands. Hence, f Γ(n, d) is a projective generator for f Cρ,df . It is easy to see
that E(n, d) ∼= Endf Cρ,df (f Γ(n, d))op, since for all λ, µ ∈ Λ(n(e − 1), d) we have

Homf Cρ,df (qaµf Cρ,df µ, qaλf Cρ,df λ) ∼= qaλ−aµf µf Cρ,df λ = qaλ−aµ f µCρ,df λ.

The lemma follows by graded Morita theory.

Write α = cont(ρ) + dδ, so that RΛ0

α is the RoCK block of §5.4. For any

m, h ∈ Z≥0, we denote by S(m, h) the usual Schur algebra over Z, as in [G].

Theorem 8.28. Suppose that n ≥ d. Then the Z-algebras RΛ0
graded Morita equivalent.

α and DQ(n, d) are

Since the algebra DQ(n, d)¯Fp is non-negatively graded, we have ℓ(DQ(n, d)¯Fp) =

ℓ(DQ(n, d)0

DQ(n, d)0 ∼=

M(d1,...,de−1)∈Λ(e−1,d)

S(n, d1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ S(n, de−1).

By [G, Theorem 3.5(a)], for all h ≤ n we have ℓ(S(n, h)¯Fp) = |P(h)|. It follows
that ℓ(DQ(n, d)¯Fp) = |P J (d)|. On the other hand, by Theorem 5.7, we have
ℓ(RΛ0

) = |P J (d)|, and the proof is complete.

Thus, we have proved Theorem A. In conclusion, we consider the case where we
work over a ﬁeld of suﬃciently large characteristic, cf. the discussion in Section 1.

Proposition 8.29. Suppose that n ≥ d and k is a ﬁeld with char k = 0 or
char k > d. Then the RoCK block RΛ0
α,k, the Turner double DQ(n, d)k and the
wreath products Wd,k and (RΛ0
δ,k)⊗d ⋊ kSd are all graded Morita equivalent to each
other.

Proof. We write x := x ⊗ 1 ∈ Ak for any algebra A and any x ∈ A. By (the proof
of) Theorem 8.28, the algebras RΛ0
α,k, Cρ,d,k and DQ(n, d)k are graded Morita

Cρ,d,k, so Cρ,d,k is graded Morita equivalent to

EndCρ,d,k(Cρ,d,kγω) ∼= γωCρ,d,kγω ∼= Wd,k.

where the second isomorphism comes from Theorem 8.9. Recall the idempotent
eJ from (7.9). By the d = 1 case of Lemma 8.10, the module RΛ0
δ,keJ is a projective
J , we have that ((RΛ0

δ,k)⊗d ⋊ kSd)ξ is

where for the second isomorphism we use the fact that eJ RΛ0
Theorem 4.17].
