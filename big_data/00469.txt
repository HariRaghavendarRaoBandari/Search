Hyperkagome iridate, Na4Ir3O8, has been regarded as a promising candidate material for a three-
dimensional quantum spin liquid. Here the three-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles
forms the hyperkagome lattice of Ir4+ ions. Due to strong spin-orbit coupling, the local moments of
Ir4+ ions are described by the pseudospin jeﬀ = 1/2 Kramers doublet. The Heisenberg model on this
lattice is highly frustrated and quantum/classical versions have been studied in earlier literature. In
this work, we derive a generic local-moment model beyond the Heisenberg limit for the hyperkagome
iridate by considering multi-orbital interactions for all the t2g orbitals and spin-orbit coupling. The
lifting of massive classical degeneracy in the Heisenberg model by various spin-anisotropy terms
is investigated at the classical level and the resulting phase diagram is presented. We ﬁnd that
diﬀerent anisotropy terms prefer distinct classes of magnetically ordered phases, often with various
discrete degeneracy. The implications of our results for recent µSR and NMR experiments on this
material and possible quantum spin liquid phases are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Recent budding interest on 5d transition metal ox-
ides stems from the promise for emergent novel quantum
ground states resulting from the cooperative eﬀects of
strong spin-orbit coupling and electron interactions.1–3
For example, various topological phases are proposed to
occur, which include topological insulator, topological
semi-metal and quantum spin liquid phases as well as
unusual magnetic states and superconductors.

In particular, iridates have enjoyed signiﬁcant atten-
tion due to availability of a variety of materials.1–3 When
the spin-orbit coupling dominates over the crystal ﬁeld
splitting, the basic electronic structure of iridates with
Ir4+ ions can be described by the pseudospin jeﬀ = 1/2
Kramers doublet,4,5 which is a combination of the spin
and orbital wave functions. Hence, in the strong cou-
pling limit, the Ir ions carry jeﬀ = 1/2 moments and the
resulting interaction between them presents highly quan-
tum mechanical ﬂuctuations. Such an interacting local
moment system would be an ideal platform for emergent
quantum spin liquid states6 when it is placed on geomet-
rically frustrated lattices or the interaction itself has the
capacity of generating massive classical degeneracy.

Currently two diﬀerent classes of systems have been
proposed for possible quantum spin liquid phases in iri-
In the hyperkagome iridate, Na4Ir3O8,7–13 the
dates.
Ir ions form a three-dimensional network of corner-
sharing triangles, which provides the geometric frustra-
tion for the Heisenberg model.
Indeed no magnetic
ordering has been observed down to a few Kelvin in
spite of the large Curie-Weiss temperature, ΘCW ≈
−650K.7 Possible quantum spin liquid and other related
phases have been investigated via a variety of theoretical
approaches.14–28 In an alternative avenue, 2D (Na2IrO3,
α-Li2IrO3) honeycomb29–31 and 3D (β- or γ-Li2IrO3)
hyperhoneycomb32,33 iridates have been investigated in

the context of bond-dependent interactions, such as the
Kitaev interaction, between local moments34–39. Such
interactions, even if they are placed on bipartite lattices
such as the honeycomb lattice, would generate extensive
classical degeneracy and may lead to quantum spin liquid
phases as the case for the pure Kitaev model.40–44

In this work, we investigate a generic local-moment
model for the hyperkagome iridate and examine the ef-
fects of anisotropic interactions beyond the Heisenberg
limit. Earlier works on the hyperkagome iridate mostly
study the Heisenberg model14–17,23,26 or the eﬀects of se-
lected sets of anisotropic interactions.18,21,22,27,28 Here we
provide the derivation of a generic model for jeﬀ = 1/2
local moments of Ir4+ ions by taking into account multi-
orbital interactions and spin-orbit coupling. Remarkably,
various “frustrating” bond-anisotropic interactions arise.
The resulting model is characterized by four parameters;
J for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, D for
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, K for a Kitaev-
like term, and Γ for the symmetric anisotropic exchange.
The relative sign and form of these anisotropic exchange
interactions depend on the bond directions and are com-
pletely ﬁxed by the lattice symmetries. As a result, the
generic model for hyperkagome iridate has both of the in-
gredients for massive classical degeneracy, namely the ge-
ometric frustration and frustrated exchange interactions.
Indeed all of the J-only, K-only, Γ-only models are frus-
trated and support distinct sets of classically-degenerate
manifold. This is in contrast to the honeycomb or hy-
perhoneycomb systems, where J-only model leads to a
unique antiferromagnetically-ordered ground state.
Given that the Curie-Weiss temperature is large and
negative, we assume that J ∼ 300K is the dominant en-
ergy scale and examine the eﬀects of small anisotropic
interactions represented by D, K, and Γ. This approach
is motivated by recent µSR and NMR experiments where
short-range spin correlations and/or some kind of spin

freezing behaviors have been discovered below T ∼ 6-
7K.9,13 The idea is that various small anisotropic inter-
actions become much more important below 6-7K and
the understanding of the nature of the ground state may
require careful examination of the eﬀects of these small
perturbations while physics of the higher temperature
phase may still be understood using the Heisenberg in-
teraction.

As the ﬁrst step towards this goal, we map out the
magnetic phase diagram for the classical model using the
Luttinger-Tisza45,46 and classical Monte Carlo simulated
annealing methods. In particular, we examine how the
massive classical degeneracy of the Heisenberg model is
lifted depending on which anisotropic interaction is dom-
inant. The resulting phase diagram for a selected set of
parameters is shown in Fig. 1. There exist three dom-
inant q = 0 ground state manifolds with Z2 or two dis-
6 and Z2p
tinct Z6 discrete degeneracies, labelled as Z1p
6 ,
in addition to an incommensurate magnetic order. Here
Z1p
6 (Z2p
6 ) refers to the manifold of classical ground states
where the direction of one (two) of the moments on each
triangle is almost parallel to the local C2 axis at each
site, which we will deﬁne later, while the remaining two
(one) are not (see Figs. 5 and 6). When D > 0 and
Γ > 0, the q = 0 state with Z2 degeneracy (which is
called the canted windmill state18) is the ground state.
If D > 0 and Γ < 0, the q = 0 state with Z1p
6 degeneracy
is dominant for relatively large Γ. On the other hand,
when D < 0, K < 0, and Γ < 0, the q = 0 state with
Z2p
6 degeneracy becomes dominant for large K. In gen-
eral, D, Γ, K promote the q = 0 states with Z2, Z1p
6 , Z2p
6
degeneracy, respectively (see the phase diagrams in Figs.
4, 5, 6).

If the q = 0 states with discrete degeneracy dominate
the low temperature short-range spin correlations, one of
the degenerate states, once it is formed locally in certain
regions, may not easily relax to another degenerate con-
ﬁgurations. This is due to the constrained spin dynamics
in frustrated magnets, as explained in the main text. The
energy/temperature scale where these phenomena occur
will be set by the dominant anisotropic interactions. This
may explain the spin freezing or slow spin dynamics ob-
served in the experiments. Our results also suggest that
it would be fruitful to investigate quantum spin liquid
phases that may be obtained by quantum disordering the
q = 0 states described above.

ferent orientations chosen from (111), (¯111), (1¯11), and
(11¯1) planes, leading to a large cubic unit cell with 12
sites/sublattices and 24 nearest-neighbor (NN) bonds
(Fig. 2). The lattice is characterized by several sym-
metries that are useful to describe the model and the
magnetic structure. First, there exists the C3 rotational
symmetry with respect to the C3 axis through the center
of each triangle. For example, the [111] axis through the
triangle formed by the sites 1, 2, 3 represents such a ro-
tation symmetry [Fig. 3 (a)]. Another useful symmetry
is the local C2 rotation that acts between two neighbor-
ing triangles.18 As described in Fig. 3 (b), for each site
there exists a C2 rotation that transforms one triangle
sharing the same site into the other. Due to the global
C3 and local C2 rotation symmetries, all the NN bonds
are equivalent on the hyperkagome lattice.

We ﬁnd it useful to classify the NN bonds on the hy-
perkagome lattice into three categories. The NN bonds
are labeled as the x-, y-, z-bonds if they are parallel to
the yz, zx, xy planes in the global coordinates, respec-
tively. The x-, y-, z-bonds are denoted by red, blue,
and green, respectively, in Figs. 2 and 3. This bond
classiﬁcation leads to a natural characterization of the
sites/sublattices. Each site has four NN bonds, two of
which make a straight line through the site and hence
parallel to each other. We now label each site in terms
of the bond-type of the two parallel bonds. For instance,
if there are two parallel z-bonds for a given site, this site
is labeled as the z-site [see the site 3 in Fig. 3 (b)]. We
use the same color scheme for the sites as for the bonds,
i.e., the x-, y-, z-sites are denoted by red, blue, green,
respectively.

We start with a brief introduction on the structure
and symmetries of the hyperkagome lattice, which will
be used to describe the local-moment model introduced
in the next section. The hyperkagome lattice is a three
dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles and can
be thought as a higher dimensional version of the kagome
lattice. In contrast to the kagome lattice, however, the
corner-sharing triangles are not coplanar and have dif-

The aforementioned C2 axis at a site is closely related
to the character of the site. For example, the C2 axis at
a z-site is perpendicular to the z axis and also the bond
direction deﬁned by the two parallel NN bonds for the
site. Accordingly, the site 3 (z-site) with the [1¯10] bond
direction has the [110] C2 axis [Fig. 3 (b)]. The local C2
axes for the 12 sublattices as well as the site classiﬁcation
are summarized in Table I.

circumferential (φ) directions. The diagrams highlight three q = 0 noncoplanar magnetic phases: Z2 windmill (orange), Z2p

other magnetic phases such as the N´eel (gray) and ferrimagnetic (green) phases. The yellow dot indicates a special point where
the Z2 windmill and Z2p

are described in Sec. IV.

III. MODEL

α-type bond ij, β and γ are ﬁxed in such a way that
αβγ is a cyclic permutation of xyz. The bond-dependent
sign factors, ηij, ξij (= ±), determined by the C3 and C2
symmetries mentioned above are summarized in Table II.
Throughout the paper, we ﬁx the Heisenberg coupling to
be one (J = 1).

The Hamiltonian described above can be derived ex-
plicitly by using a strong coupling expansion for the t2g
electrons with the Kanamori-type multiorbital interac-
tions such as the Coulomb interaction U and Hund’s
coupling JH .25,35,47,48 Here the strong spin-orbit cou-
pling is taken into account via the projection of the t2g
manifold into the jeﬀ = 1/2 Kramers doublet after the
large interaction limit is taken.
In this work, we con-
sider the ideal crystal structure and use the Slater-Koster
parametrization50 to represent the hopping amplitudes
between t2g orbitals. Details of this derivation are pro-
vided in Appendix A.

In the rest of this paper, we investigate the classical
ground states of this model Hamiltonian. For conve-
nience, we will often call jeﬀ = 1/2 moment as “spin”

in the discussion of the classical ground states. First, we
notice that the ground states are highly degenerate in
the Heisenberg limit (K = D = Γ = 0). The degenerate
ground states are characterized by the 120◦ spin structure
on each triangle, i.e., Si + Sj + Sk = 0 among the three
spins on the triangle. When the Heisenberg model is
perturbed by anisotropic interactions as assumed for the
hyperkagome iridate, the macroscopic ground state de-
generacy will be lifted. To investigate the ground states
selected by the anisotropies and their physical properties,
we solve the classical model by employing the Luttinger-
Tisza and simulated annealing methods. The resulting
phase diagram is shown in Fig. 1. In the next section,
we explain three major q = 0 noncoplanar magnetically-
ordered states shown in this phase diagram.

IV. Q = 0 NONCOPLANAR STATES

In our analysis for the classical limit of the Hamilto-
nian, we ﬁnd three q = 0 noncoplanar states that take
fairly large regions in the parameter space. The three
states can be represented as (i) Z2 windmill, (ii) Z2p
6 , and
(iii) Z1p
states and they are labeled by the discrete de-
generacy (subscript) and the character of the spin conﬁg-
urations (superscript). The discrete degeneracy of each
state can be understood from the time-reversal and/or
C3 rotation symmetries as explained below.

A. Z2 windmill states

The Z2 (doubly degenerate) windmill states are fea-
tured with the 120◦ spin structures where the spin mo-
ment at each site is aligned along the local bond direction
deﬁned by the direction of two parallel NN bonds or the

The ﬁgure shows the 12 sites (labelled with 1,··· , 12) and 24
nearest-neighbor bonds in a cubic unit cell. The sites with a
primed number mean sites that belong to a neighboring unit
cell. The sites (nearest-neighbor bonds) in red, blue, green
represent the x-, y-, z-sites (bonds), respectively. For the
classiﬁcations of the sites and bonds, see Sec. II.

tation symmetry. The cyan arrow along the [111] direction
represents the C3 axis at the triangle formed by the sites 1,
2, 3. (b) The local C2 rotation. For each site on the hyper-
kagome lattice, there are two triangles sharing the site. The
two triangles are related by a local C2 rotation. The pink

local triangular planes, but the overall spin structure still
preserves the C3 rotation invariance and twofold degener-
acy given by the time reversal. The canting is attributed
to the eﬀect of the anisotropic spin interactions. The
simplest model that allows the windmill states is the
J-D model. When the Heisenberg model is perturbed
with the positive Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interac-
tion (D > 0), the canted windmill states with the twofold
degeneracy appear as the ground states (Fig. 4). The net
canting component at a local triangle is perpendicular to
the triangular plane. With the negative DM interaction
(D < 0) for the J-D model, we ﬁnd incommensurate
states in the ground state manifold. The canted windmill
states was discussed in Ref. [18] as the classical ground
states selected by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

B. Z2p

6 states

6

In the spin conﬁgurations of the Z2p

states, only two
out of the three types of sites (x-, y-, and z-sites) have
spin moments parallel to the local C2 axes. This explains
the superscript 2p in Z2p
6 . Let us ﬁrst consider three
states that will be called yz, zx, xy states. For example,
the yz state means that the spins at the y- and z-sites are
parallel to the local C2 axes, respectively. In contrast, the
spins at the x-sites are perpendicular to the local axes,
and at the same time parallel to the bond directions.
One of the yz-type states is visualized in Fig. 5. As seen
in the ﬁgure, only the spin moments at the x-sites are
parallel to the local triangular planes. The zx and xy
states are deﬁned in similar ways. Notice that yz, zx,
xy states are related to each other by the C3 rotations.
One can now obtain the other three states by acting the
time reversal on the former three states. The latter three
states obtained this way are also related to each other by
the C3 rotations. Hence the six states in the Z2p
6 manifold
can be divided into two groups, each having three states
related to each other by the C3 rotations, and these two
groups are transformed to each other by the time reversal.
6 states generally have
canting of the spin moments from the idealized spin con-
ﬁgurations described above. The J-K model is simplest
model where one can ﬁnd the Z2p
6 ground states. When
the Kitaev interaction is ferromagnetic (K < 0), the Z2p
6
states appear (as well as the Z2 windmill states) in the
ground state manifold (see Fig. 5). With the antiferro-
magnetic Kitaev interaction (K > 0), we ﬁnd ferrimag-
netic ground states with eightfold degeneracy. Details
of the Luttinger-Tisza analysis for the J-K model are
provided in Appendix B.

straight line formed by two NN bonds sharing the given
site. Hence, there are two possible choices for the direc-
tion of the spin moment at each site. Once the direction
is chosen for one of the sites and if we arrange the spin
moments at other sites to satisfy the 120◦ spin structure
at every local triangle, we obtain one of the Z2 windmill
states. The other windmill state is obtained by acting
the time reversal on the former state. One of the wind-
mill state is shown in Fig. 4. Notice that the windmill
states are invariant under all of the C3 rotations about
the [111], [¯111], [1¯11], and [11¯1] axes.

The ideal windmill structure described above occurs
only at some special places in the phase diagram.
In
general, the spin moments are slightly canted out of the

are found with the ideal structure described above (Fig.

ated in the Z1p
states when more than two anisotropic
interactions exist as we shall see later.
In the other
case with Γ > 0, one can ﬁnd incommensurate states
and the windmill states and they are separated by the
phase boundary Γ/J = 0.73. We provide details of the
Luttinger-Tisza analysis for the J-Γ model in Appendix
C.

we discussed for the latter are also found in the former.
As implied by the superscript 1p, an important diﬀerence
between them is the number of the types of the sites that
have the spins along the local C2 axes. For the Z1p
6 states,
three states related by the C3 rotations are labeled as the
x, y, z states. In the x state, only at the x-sites the spin
moments are parallel to the local axes (see Fig. 6). Inter-
estingly, at the y- and z-sites the spin moments are lying
along the xy- and xz-planes. This is another point that
diﬀerentiates the Z1p
states. The y
and z states are deﬁned similarly. Again the other three
states can be obtained by the time reversal.

INTERPLAY OF TWO DIFFERENT

ANISOTROPIES

The major q = 0 magnetic orders arise as a result of the
degeneracy lifting by various anisotropic interactions and
it is shown above that D > 0, K < 0, Γ < 0 would favor
the Z2 windmill, Z2p
6 states, respectively, when they
are separately present in addition to the Heisenberg in-
teraction. Now we consider the cases where two diﬀerent
anisotropies exist in addition to the Heisenberg interac-
tion and investigate the interplay between two competing
degeneracy breaking perturbations.

We present the phase diagrams of the J-K-D, J-K-
Γ, J-D-Γ models in Fig. 7. Here we again focus on
the Z2 windmill (orange), Z2p
(light blue)
states. Notice that no other q = 0 state arises in the
phase diagram. First, the Z2 windmill states are gener-
ally favored when K < 0, D > 0, Γ > 0. On the other
hand, the Z2p
states are stabilized when K < 0, D < 0,
Γ < 0, especially with comparable magnitudes of D and
Γ. The Z1p
states are found to appear when the sym-
metric & anisotropic interaction Γ < 0 is dominant over
other anisotropies.

As discussed earlier, the Z2 windmill and Z2p

states
are the degenerate ground states when only the ferro-
magnetic Kitaev interaction is present in addition to the
Heisenberg interaction [denoted with the yellow line in
Figs. 7 (a) and (b)]. It is interesting to note that this
Z8 degeneracy is lifted when the J-K model with K < 0
is additionally perturbed by the D or Γ interaction: the
positive D and Γ favor the Z2 states while the opposite
sign choices select the Z2p
6 states [see the orange and pink
regions in Figs. 7 (a) and (b)]. Such competition between
the Z2 and Z2p
states was discussed in a previous study
on the classical J-K-D model.28

Apart from the noncoplanar q = 0 states, we ﬁnd
other magnetic phases such as the ferrimagnetic (green),
N´eel (gray), and incommensurate (white) phases. Among
these, the incommensurate state occupies a large region
in the phase diagram, reﬂecting the magnetic frustration
arising from the competing anisotropic interactions.

VI. FULL PHASE DIAGRAM

We now discuss the full phase diagrams of the generic
J-K-Γ-D model shown in Fig. 1. Here, the coupling
constants are parametrized as follows.

J = 1,
K = 0.3 sinθ cosφ,
Γ = 0.3 sinθ sinφ,
D = 0.3 cosθ,

(2a)
(2b)
(2c)
(2d)
where 0 ≤ θ < π and 0 ≤ φ < 2π. The two dia-
grams in the ﬁgure correspond to the two diﬀerent signs
of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction: (a) D > 0 and

7

(b) D < 0. In each case, the center and the circumfer-
ence of the disk diagram represent the J-D (θ = 0 or π)
and J-K-Γ (θ = π/2) models, respectively. These two
limits are interpolated by moving along the radial direc-
tion (parametrized by θ). The circumferential direction
is represented by the other angular variable φ.

As shown in the phase diagram, the noncoplanar q = 0
states appear as dominant commensurate phases even
when all the three anisotropies come into play together.
Notably, for the positive DM coupling (D > 0), the wind-
mill state prevails in the vast region connecting the J-K-
Γ and the J-D models and pushes away the incommen-
surate phase from the center. When the DM coupling
is negative (D > 0), the windmill state, however, loses
its dominance over the incommensurate phase. The lat-
ter extends from the circumference (J-K-Γ model) to the
center (J-D model) when D > 0. Other phases such as
the ferrimagnetic and N´eel states show up as a point and
in a small region of the phase diagrams.

VII. DISCUSSION

In this work, we constructed a generic local-moment
model for the hyperkagome iridate Na4Ir3O8, which in-
cludes various frustrating anisotropic interactions (K,
Γ, D) between the jeﬀ = 1/2 moments in addition to
the dominant Heisenberg interaction (J). Using the
Luttinger-Tisza analysis and simulated annealing, we
mapped out the classical phase diagram. It is found that
there exist three dominant q = 0 noncoplanar magnetic
orders as well as an incommensurate order. The q = 0
orders (Z2, Z2p
6 ) are characterized by discrete de-
generacies and the degenerate classical ground states are
related to each other via the global C3 rotation and/or
the time-reversal symmetry.

6 , Z1p

We now discuss possible implications of the q = 0 or-
ders for the recent µSR and NMR experiments.9,13 In
these experiments, spin freezing behaviors or slow spin
ﬂuctuations have been discovered below Tf = 6-7K in
polycrystalline samples. Assuming that the short-range
magnetic orders below 6-7K are determined by various
anisotropic interactions, the q = 0 magnetic orders Z2p
6
and Z1p
6 , if they are taken as the dominant short-range
magnetic correlations, may oﬀer the explanation of the
spin freezing behaviors. Due to the small anisotropic
interactions, the Z2p
represent shallow energy
minima in the degenerate ground state manifold of the
Heisenberg model. Hence the spin dynamics in the pres-
ence of thermal and quantum ﬂuctuations is constrained
to occur within this degenerate ground state manifold.
This means that, if one of the six degenerate spin states
in Z2p
is locally formed in the system, it requires
an inﬁnite number of spin ﬂip moves to reach another
member of the six degenerate spin states. This is be-
cause these degenerate states are related to each other
by the global C3 (as well as the time-reversal) symmetry
and they are far away from each other in the phase space

phases. The yellow line represents a special case where the Z2 and Z2p
6 states become degenerate and form together the ground
state manifold.

corresponding to the degenerate ground state manifold
of the Heisenberg model. This means there would be a
large kinetic barrier between six degenerate spin states
and it will be hard to move from one spin state to the
other. Hence diﬀerent kinds of degenerate spin states
with a short-range order may persist for a long period of
time in diﬀerent regions of the system. This can lead to
spin freezing behaviors or slow spin ﬂuctuations.

One can imagine that quantum ﬂuctuations may over-
come the kinetic barrier at low temperatures and restore
the locally-broken (by the q = 0 short-range order) C3
symmetry. In this case, the quantum ground state may
form a quantum spin liquid with the global C3 symme-
try. Finding such a quantum ground state and making
connections to the classical limit would be an excellent
topic of future research.

Appendix A: Derivation of the spin exchange

interactions

In this appendix, we provide the derivation of the
jeﬀ = 1/2 spin model [Eq.
(1)] for the hyperkagome
iridate Na4Ir3O8. First, we brieﬂy review strong cou-
pling expansion for the Kanamori type multiorbital
interactions.35,47–49 Then, we construct our model for
Na4Ir3O8.

1. Strong coupling expansion

We are grateful to P. Mendels for detailed explana-
tions of his experimental data and helpful discussions.

Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, and the Cen-
ter for Quantum Materials at the University of Toronto.

Photon Science (ALPS).

For a simple setting of the strong coupling expansion,
we consider a two-site system described by the following
Hamiltonian.

H12 = Hint + Hsoc + Hhop.

(A1)

We assume that each site has ﬁve electrons (or one hole)
in the t2g manifold as in the Ir4+ ion. The above Hamil-
tonian consists of the atomic multiorbital interactions
(Hint), spin-orbit coupling (Hsoc), and electron hoppings
(Hhop) between the two sites.
In the strong coupling
expansion, we assume that Hint (cid:29) Hsoc (cid:29) Hhop.

scribed by only the interaction term:

Here, we employed the well known Kanamori Hamilto-
nian for the multiorbital interactions. The Hamiltonian
is parametrized with the intraorbital Coulomb interac-
tion (U ) and the Hund’s coupling (JH ).
It is readily
diagonalized in terms of the total hole number (Ni) in
the t2g manifold, and total spin (Si) and total orbital
(Li) angular momenta at each site (i = 1, 2). Hence, the
eigenstates at each site can be represented by the three
|Ni, Si, Li(cid:105). Notice that we are us-
quantum numbers:
ing the hole basis here instead of the electron basis. We
summarize the eigenstates with Ni = 0, 1, 2 in Table III.
The atomic ground state manifold is characterized with
the quantum numbers: Ni = 1, Si = 1/2, Li = 1.
Next, we turn on the atomic spin-orbit coupling:

Hsoc =

−λLi · Si.

(A3)

i=1

Note that the coupling constant (−λ) has a minus sign
when written in the hole basis. We incorporate eﬀect of
the spin-orbit coupling by projecting the atomic ground
state manifold |Ni = 1, Si = 1/2, Li = 1(cid:105) into the jeﬀ =
1/2 Kramers doublet (where jeﬀ = L + S).

We introduce electron/hole hoppings between the two
sites. We assume the most generic hopping Hamiltonian
as follows.

Hhop =

ˆd2,σ + H.c.

(A4)

2(cid:88)

9

Here, ˆdi,σ = (di,yz,σ, di,xz,σ, di,xy,σ)T are the hole annihi-
lation operators at the site i. The subscripts yz, xz, xy
represent the single-hole (Ni = 1) states in the t2g ba-
sis, and σ(=↑,↓) means the spin state of the hole. The
hopping amplitude matrix t12 is parametrized with nine
independent real parameters:

 s + qxx qxy + vz qxz − vy

qxy − vz s + qyy
qyz + vx
qxz + vy qyz − vx s + qzz

 .

t12 =

(A5)

The hopping matrix is basically decomposed into the
trace (s), antisymmetric vector (v), and traceless sym-
metric matrix (q).

Now the eﬀective exchange interactions are derived
with the strong coupling expansion. As mentioned ear-
lier, we assume that U, JH (cid:29) λ (cid:29) t. By reﬂecting the
hopping eﬀects on the jeﬀ = 1/2 doublets via the sec-
ond order perturbation theory, we obtain the eﬀective
exchange interactions:

 ˜J + ˜Γxx

˜Γxy + ˜Dz ˜Γxz − ˜Dy
˜Γxy − ˜Dz
˜J + ˜Γyy
˜Γyz + ˜Dx

2. Model for the hyperkagome iridate

We construct the jeﬀ = 1/2 spin model for the hyper-
kagome iridate Na4Ir3O8. In the actual crystal structure
of Na4Ir3O8,7 most of the anisotropic couplings in H12
[Eq. (A6)] are expected to be nonzero due to lattice dis-
tortions from an ideal structure.
In this work, instead

of pursuing the actual crystal structure, we idealize the
structure in such a way that each Ir-O bond is parallel
to one of the global x, y, z axes and the bond length is
uniform across all the bonds (Fig. 8). With the ideal-
ized crystal structure, we derive a relatively simple, but
still generic spin Hamiltonian for Na4Ir3O8. We show
the derivation by taking the Ir-Ir bond (6,5) in Fig. 2 as
an example. First, we express the hopping matrix at the

above hopping amplitudes take the following form.

Here, the parameters Vddσ, Vddπ, Vddδ represent direct
hoppings between the neighboring Ir sites. The param-
eter Vpdπi (i = 1, 2) means the hoppings between the 2p
orbitals at the Oi site and t2g orbitals at an Ir site, and
∆i implies the energy diﬀerence between the former and
latter orbitals. Hence, the amplitude − V 2
indicates
the indirect hopping via the intermediate oxygen site Oi.
Notice that there are two distinct oxygen sites, O1 and
O2, in the compound (see Fig. 8). The O1 (O2) sites are
shared by neighboring three (two) Ir ions. We assume
that Vpdπ1 (cid:54)= Vpdπ2 and ∆1 (cid:54)= ∆2 for the inequivalent
O1 and O2 sites. The above hopping matrix can be de-
composed into the form of Eq. (A5) with the following

The resulting exchange interactions caused by the

K = 3˜Γzz/2,

The exchange interactions at other bonds are generated
by applying the C3 and C2 symmetry operations (Sec.

model Hamiltonian H [Eq. (1)].

Appendix B: Luttinger-Tisza analysis for the J-K

model

(cid:88)

The Luttinger-Tisza analysis (LTA) for the J-K model
is discussed in details here. First, the LTA is brieﬂy
reviewed.45,46 In the LTA, we relax the hard spin con-
straint |Si| = 1 and implement it on average: |S1 + S2 +
··· + SN| = N (N is the number of the spin moments).
The resulting quadratic Hamiltonian matrix is solved in
the momentum space.

H =

ST(−q)J (q)S(q),

(B1)

q

In this expression, the 3Ns×3Ns matrix J (q) is the block
Hamiltonian matrix in the momentum q sector (Ns is the
number of the sublattice in a unit cell, and Ns = 12 in
our hyperkagome lattice model). The 3Ns-component
column vector S(q) represents a Fourier component of
the real space spins (S1, S2,··· , SN ). After ﬁnding the
lowest energy state of H, we check whether the state
satisﬁes the hard spin constraint. If it does, the lowest
energy state is the exact ground state of the Hamiltonian.
When the hard spin constraint is not satisﬁed, the LTA
provides a lower bound for the ground state energy.
Now we apply the LTA to the J-K model HJK. One
can easily ﬁnd that the lowest energy state occur at q =
0 by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix JJK(q) (see

Fig. 9). Hence, we focus on the q = 0 sector of HJK and
analyze the spin structure of the lowest energy mode.
The q = 0 Hamiltonian can be block diagonalized in the
following way.

As shown in Fig. 9 (d), a diﬀerent lowest energy state is

11

When the Kitaev interaction is antiferromagnetic (k >
0), the ground state has the energy E5(k) and the corre-
sponding spin state is constructed in the following way.
First, we note that the three matrices Jx,y,z have the
z ∝ (u, u, u, u) with
same eigenvector: ST
√
u = (1,− 1+
9+8k+2k2

as

with the sign factors a, b, c (= ±). One can check that
the eight states satisfy the hard spin constraint. These
states are the eightfold degenerate ferrimagnetic states
mentioned in the main text (Fig. 5).
In the case of the ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction
(k < 0), the matrices Jx,y,z have the almost same eigen-
x ∝ (v,−v, v,−v),
vector except the sign structure: ST
z ∝ (−v,−v, v, v) with v =
y ∝ (−v, v, v,−v), ST
ST
(1, 1−
, 1). The ground state manifold can be con-
structed by taking eight diﬀerent combinations of Sx,y,z
as we did in Eq.
(B6). One can check the hard spin
constraint for each of the eight states, and ﬁnd that the
ground state manifold consists of the Z2 windmill states
and Z2p
states (Fig. 5). In this case, the ground state
energy is given by E3(k).

Appendix C: Luttinger-Tisza analysis for the J-Γ

model

In this section, we describe the LTA for the J-Γ model
HJΓ. The lowest energy state occur at diﬀerent positions
in the Brillouin zone depending on the value of the cou-
pling constant Γ (see Fig. 10). We focus on the Γ < 0
case where the LTA provides the exact ground states of
HJΓ. In this case, the lowest energy mode has a ﬂat dis-
persion along the ΓR line in the Brillouin zone. However,
it turns out that none of the ﬁnite-q states satisfy the
hard spin constraint (the absence of the ﬁnite-q states is
also conﬁrmed by our simulated annealing approaches).
In the following, we will examine the q = 0 states and
construct the ground state manifold for the Γ < 0 case.
Interestingly, the q = 0 states are the lowest energy
states for each of HJ and HΓ. The q = 0 states of
HJΓ can be obtained by investigating the ground state
manifold of HΓ and then considering the Heisenberg in-
teraction on the manifold. Hence, we solve the Γ-only
model HΓ ﬁrst. We set Γ = −1 and block diagonalize

To obtain the ground states of HJΓ, the Heisenberg
interaction is considered on the ground state manifold
of HΓ. By examining the Heisenberg interaction energy
for each state, one can ﬁnd that only six states in the
manifold have the minimum energy, −J/2 per bond. The
six states represented by

 w−w

(w − z)

 , ±

 (w − z)−z

z−(w − z)

 z
 , ±

(w − z)−w

 ,

w

z
(C6)
are the Z1p
states (Fig. 6). The above three pairs of
vectors sequently correspond to Z1p
6 x, y, z states. It is
interesting to note that the state vectors do not depend
on the coupling constant Γ.

Appendix D: Spin structure factors for the q = 0

magnetic orders

Here we provide the static spin structure factors for the
q = 0 magnetic orders. These structure factors are com-
puted for the long-range ordered cases. For each q = 0
order, the structure factor is calculated with the formula

S(q) =

Here, N is the number of spin moments and ri represents
the real space position of the moment Si at site i. Note

Here, as the basis for the spin vector we choose ST =

is non-vanishing only when the wave vector q is equal
to a reciprocal lattice vector. Accordingly, the structure
factor has nonzero peaks only at the reciprocal lattice
vectors. The structure factors for the q = 0 orders are
plotted in Figs. 11, 12 and 13, where q = 2π(h, k, l) with
h, k, l being integers. In these ﬁgures, one can see that
the structure factor is zero at q = 0 for all of the three
states.51 It is also seen that for the Z2 windmill state,
the structure factor patterns for all three planes are the
same. This results from the C3 rotational invariance of
6 -yz and Z1p
the Z2 state. On the other hand, for the Z2p
6 -
x states, the structure factor pattern on the (0kl) plane
is diﬀerent from the others, because of the broken C3
rotational symmetry. Moreover, Z2p
6 -x states
show diﬀerent patterns in the structure factor. These
diﬀerences may be used to distinguish three diﬀerent q =
0 states.
