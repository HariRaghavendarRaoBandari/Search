Quantum metrology promises high-precision measurements beyond the capability of any classical techniques.
This has the potential to be integral to investigative techniques. However, all sensors must tolerate imperfec-
tions if their operation is to be practical. Here we show that photons without perfectly overlapped modes,
which are therefore partially-distinguishable, are not required for quantum-enhancement of measurement and
partially-distinguishable photons do not have to be engineered to mitigate the adverse effects of distinguishabil-
ity. We quantify the effect of distinguishability on quantum metrology experiments and conduct an experiment
to verify the utility of two- and four-photon states containing partially-distinguishable photons by observing
quantum-enhanced sensitivity with low-visibility quantum interference. This demonstrates that sources produc-
ing photons with mixed spectral states can be readily utilised in quantum-metrology systems.

In an ideal scenario,

the use of non-classical states of
N photons to measure an optical phase θ will enable the
scaling of precision to be increased beyond the shot-noise

limit (SNL)—δθ ∝ 1/√N—to the fundamental Heisenberg
limit—δθ ∝ 1/N [1]. However, a real sensor will operate in
non-ideal conditions with non-ideal parameters. Effects such
as photon loss and phase diffusion remove much of the advan-
tage offered by non-classical techniques, so that the SNL can
only be beaten by a constant factor [2, 3], motivating the need
to study imperfections in quantum metrology [4]. Proposals
for photonic quantum metrology typically exploit quantum in-
terference of photons which have exactly the same parame-
ters and are therefore perfectly indistinguishable. Achieving
this indistinguishability is a major technical challenge in prac-
tice, in particular for immature and developing photon source
technology. Here we study the effect on precision measure-
ments using non-classical probe states that contain partially-
distinguishable photons, which leads to degraded quantum in-
terference. We ﬁnd that despite high levels of distinguisha-
bility, it is still possible to achieve a quantum advantage in
interferometry—if this is the only imperfection and provided
there is non-zero indistinguishability, Heisenberg scaling is
still achieved. This classiﬁes the effect of distinguishability as
separate to those of optical loss and phase diffusion. We per-
form a proof-of-principle experiment to observe the quantum
advantage that can be achieved with 2- and 4-photon probe
states with varied distinguishability.

Quantum metrology promises an advantage where high pre-
cision is needed whilst minimising probe intensity to avoid
damaging the system under investigation [5, 6]. To in-
crease impact in utility, developments in quantum metrol-
ogy must address the optical needs of samples being inves-
tigated. Creating states which possess desired optical proper-
ties with highly-indistinguishable photons is a technological
challenge and has been achieved at a handful of wavelengths
[7–10]. However, systems which could use only partially-
distinguishable photons would have a greatly-reduced techno-
logical challenge associated with creating the photon source.
Such systems could dramatically increase the early appli-
cation of photon sources in spectral regions where highly-

indistinguishable photons have not yet been demonstrated
[11]. Furthermore, schemes based on low-visibility quantum
interference could potentially beneﬁt from reduced loss and
increased brightness by removing spectral ﬁlters.

Interference between two indistinguishable photons, known
as Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, is now the stan-
dard experiment used to quantify the indistinguishability of
photons. This is important since HOM interference is the
origin of supra-classical performance central to many con-
ceived quantum-optical technologies forming an integral part
of quantum metrology schemes, linear-optical quantum com-
puters, quantum communication and the ﬁrst loophole-free
Bell-inequality violation [12–16]. The importance of HOM
interference has recently inspired many works on photon dis-
tinguishability, present in an input state, and its effect on non-
universal quantum computers [17–22]. Whilst in a metrolog-
ical setting, studies have focused on the effect of photons be-
coming distinguishable within an interferometer [3] which re-
moves Heisenberg limited scaling. Photonic devices reported
with ﬁdelities of (cid:39) 100% indicate that distinguishability al-
ready present before the state enters the interferometer can be
the more dominant effect [23, 24].

In Ref. [25] a novel approach was presented which utilised
two photons with a carefully-engineered additional degree of
freedom, and measurement of this additional degree of free-
dom, to mitigate the effects of distinguishability on metro-
logical schemes.
In this letter we investigate the effect of
distinguishability in a situation wherein photons are mea-
sured with detectors that resolve only which path the pho-
tons are in, and no information about any additional degrees
of freedom the photons have. Positive results which apply
to this scenario would show that interferometers and detec-
tors do not need to be modiﬁed in order to operate using
partially-distinguishabile photons.
Indeed, the phase sensi-
tivity is found to degrade gently with increasing distinguisha-
bility, and precision scaling with increasing photon number
remains proportional to the Heisenberg limit. We experimen-
tally observed this degradation by controlling distinguishabil-
ity between pairs of photons and pairs of bi-photons via a
temporal delay. These photons were found to exhibit supra-

quantum and classical measurement statistics. An interferom-

the two-photon input state, the probabilities for different de-
tection outcomes are:

For comparison, the SNL for this setup is F = 2n, therefore
if the photons have any indistinguishability (I (cid:54)= 0) then the
shot-noise limit can be surpassed around θ = 0. Additionally,
sensitivity scales quadratically with increasing photon num-
ber i.e. proportional to the fundamental Heisenberg limit. If
θ is not near zero then an adaptively controlled phase can be
used to counteract θ producing the sensitivity obtained near
θ = 0 [29]. This point on the interference fringe has been
highlighted as a loss-resistant part, retaining the most phase
sensitivity in the presence of balanced loss across the arms of
the interferometer [30]. In Ref. [25], an alternative approach
has been presented to mitigate the effects of distinguishabil-
ity by using spatially-engineered photons and detectors which
resolve the positions of each photon. This approach requires
increasing distinguishability in order to mitigate its adverse
effects.

To verify the usefulness of

states with partially-
distinguishable photons, we performed an experiment using
two- and four-photon states post-selected from a Type-I spon-
taneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process. States
were post-selected by recording only detection events with the
desired number of photons, this allowed us to isolate the ef-
fects of distinguishability since the effect of optical loss is also
nulliﬁed by this procedure. The experimental setup is shown
in Fig. 2. Differently from the example above, the two-photon
state that Type-I SPDC produces is spectrally entangled

observing the coincidence probability after a 50:50 beam-
splitter, pH, as in the Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment [34, 35]:
I(cid:48) = 1 − 2pH and takes the place of I in Eq. (3) when n = 1.

classical phase sensitivity despite their distinguishability.

We use the Fisher information to quantify the sensitivity of
interference fringes to small changes of the unknown phase,
θ, due to its relation with achievable precision in the seminal
Cram´er-Rao bound: 1/δ2θ ≤ F , where δ2θ is the variance of
an unbiased estimator of θ and F is the Fisher information,
a function of the probabilities associated with different mea-
surement outcomes [26]. This bound can be saturated asymp-
totically by a large number of measurements such that F well
characterises the achievable precision of a scheme. We con-
sider photon-number-counting measurements which are de-
scribed by the set of projectors {En1n2} such that En1n2
projects onto the subspace containing all states with n1 pho-
tons in one path and n2 in the other.

To explore the role of photon distinguishability in metro-
logical schemes, we consider distinguishability introduced by
mode-mismatch. An example of a scheme using a probe
state with partially-distinguishable photons is displayed in
Fig. 1. Here the probe state is a 2n-photon dual-Fock state

( ˆf†1 ˆg†2)n/n!|0(cid:105) = |n(cid:105)f,1|n(cid:105)g,2 where ˆf†1 = (cid:82) dωf (ω)a†1(ω)
and ˆg†2 = (cid:82) dωg(ω)a†2(ω) are boson creation operators for

modes f1 and g2.
If the temporal modes f and g are mis-
matched f (cid:54)= g, then imperfect quantum interference occurs.
Output statistics for number-counting measurements can be
calculated by changing the basis of the probe state such that it
is expressed in terms of modes with well-deﬁned interference
relations [27].

Re-expressing the temporal mode g as a linear combination
of f and an orthogonal temporal mode, f⊥ ∝ g −(cid:104)g, f(cid:105)f, the
input state becomes:

|n(cid:105)f,1|n(cid:105)g,2 =

where I = |(cid:104)f, g(cid:105)|2 is the overlap of the functions f and
g and serves as a measure of indistinguishability [28]. For
I = 0 the photons will be uncorrelated as quantum interfer-
ence will not occur. Conversely for I = 1 the photons will
undergo maximal quantum interference. I(cid:48) is a simple pa-

FIG. 2. Experimental setup and example two-photon interference fringes. a: Type-I SPDC produces degenerate horizontally-polarised
photon pairs and bi-photon pairs in two spatial modes. One spatial mode is passed through a translation stage to control the mismatch
between interfering modes. The other spatial mode passes through a half-wave plate at 45◦ rotating horizontally-polarised photons into
vertically polarised ones such that the two spatial modes can be combined on a Polarising Beam-Splitter (PBS) and interfered at a HWP. The
spatially-multiplexed detection system described in Ref. [31], detects different states with different efﬁciencies, because of this the raw counts
were adjusted by a multiplicative factor to estimate the statistics of a number counting system with uniform detection efﬁciencies [32, 33]. b:

by Poisson statistics. For clarity, only one from each pair of equally probable detection patterns, {(na, nb), (nb, na)}, are shown.

separability is guaranteed ensuring I(cid:48) is positive and supra-
classical precision will be achieved. We note that regardless
of the spectral structure of such a two-photon state, be it pure
or mixed, a single exchange-symmetry parameter, as given by
pH, will completely determine the output statistics after a lin-
ear network [36]. Therefore the two-photon state from Type-I
SPDC will give results indicative of all other photon sources
with the same pH.

We use a half-wave plate (HWP) as a polarisation inter-
ferometer as displayed in Fig. 2a. The indistinguishability
parameter I(cid:48)(x) is controlled by delaying one polarisation
mode by a distance x with a translation stage prior to the in-
terferometer. Our experiment uses an 80fs pump pulse, as
such momentum conservation dictates the down-conversion
process resulting in a theoretical indistinguishability of [34]:

q(x) = 2Γ−1(1/4)(cid:82) dy exp(−y4) exp(−iyx/σ), where Γ is

the Gamma function [37] and σ is a constant dependent on
the properties of the crystal and pump laser used for down-
conversion. We obtained I(cid:48)(x) experimentally by ﬁtting
a + b q(x), to normalised coincidence rates shown in Fig. 2a,
by allowing a, b and σ to vary. At various different values of
x the phase of the interferometer was scanned over the range
[0, 2π) obtaining interference fringes with different levels of
quantum interference shown in Fig. 2c(1-4). The Fisher in-
formation was obtained from ﬁtted curves of p(r|θ) to nor-
malised interference fringes over θ. See appendix A for the

FIG. 3. Estimates of the Fisher information per photon: F (cid:48) ≡
F/(2n). Values achieved with two photons are shown in blue. Non-
linear relation between F (cid:48) and I(cid:48) is due to background noise and
is modeled in appendix B. Error bars arise from the statistical un-
certainty in the counts and are found by Monte-Carlo simulation of
experimental data followed by the same analysis as the real data
which provides a spread of estimates of the Fisher information for
each fringe.

ﬁtting procedures.

The results for Fisher information are shown in Fig. 3 for
both the two- and four-photon input states. The two-photon
data demonstrates an approximately linear degradation of the
quantum-enhanced sensitivity in line with the theoretical pre-

dation is due to background noise, which we do not correct
for, as modeled in appendix B. The effect of increased back-
ground noise is to shift the point of highest sensitivity further
away from θ = 0 in addition to lowering the sensitivity of
the fringes. For the four-photon input state, I(cid:48) by itself does
not infer a value for the Fisher information, but we note that
it does transition from a quantum-enhanced precision to near
classical precision with decreasing I(cid:48) as expected. We also
note that our four-photon input states give a higher precision
that previously reported experiments using similar states [29].
In order for supra-classical values of Fisher information to be
extracted contrast must remain high around θ = 0. This is
apparent in the fringes we obtained experimentally as shown
in Fig. 2c.

We have shown that the effects of photon distinguisha-
biltiy have a distinct nature from errors considered previ-
ously, as Heisenberg-limited scaling remains with partially-
distinguishable photons. Surprisingly, any amount of quan-
tum interference can grant a quantum advantage in the ab-
sence of any other imperfections. The experiment we per-
formed allowed us to see the gentle degradation of precision in
agreement with our theoretical prediction. We conclude that
sources of highly-indistinguishable photons are not necessary
to gain a quantum advantage in metrology. Our results reduce
technical difﬁculties associated with making photon sources
useful for metrology. Using novel photon sources such as inte-
grated sources [8], lattice defect sources [38], atomic sources
[39], heralded sources [40, 41] using fast switching, or quan-
tum memories [42, 43] and quantum dots [44] may enable
quantum enhanced measurements to be performed in new
spectral regions.

APPENDIX

A: Function ﬁtting

To obtain the estimates of the Fisher information, for the
post-selected two-photon input state as plotted in Fig. 3, the
probability functions for each of the outcomes were ﬁrst esti-
mated. Theoretically, the probability functions are:

p (|∆| = 1|θ) =
p (|∆| = 0|θ) =

1 + I(cid:48)
1
4

[1 − cos(2θ)] ,

4
[3 − I(cid:48) + (1 + I(cid:48)) cos(2θ)] ,

(4)

where ∆ = n1−n2. The detection efﬁciency of each outcome
η∆ will affect the observed statistics so we correct for this in
order to estimate the probability functions which would be
observed with ideal detection efﬁciency. These functions are
ﬁtted to our data by allowing the Fourier coefﬁcients; c to
vary. We ﬁt probability functions with positive and negative
∆ separately. Maximum-likelihood estimation is used to ﬁnd
these coefﬁcients.

Firstly, estimates of ideal detection rates are obtained by di-
viding observed detection rates by the intrinsic detection inef-
ﬁciency given by the combinatorics of a multiplexed detection
system [31, 32]. To account for the unequal count rates across
each interference fringe we ﬁt the functions in Eq. (4) to nor-
malised count rates, that is the counts of a speciﬁc outcome
divided by the total number of counts at this position. The
likelihood function to be maximised is:

where xθ
∆ are the observed number of counts and x∆ is a vec-
tor of such over θ, λθ
∆ is an estimate for the expected number
of observed counts of ∆ type given c∆, λθ
∆/η∆ is
a maximum likelihood estimate for the total number of events
an ideal detector would record at this value of θ. The Log
likelihood function was maximised numerically. Many ran-
dom initial guesses of c∆ are followed by gradient ascent to
try and ﬁnd the global likelihood maximum.

To ﬁnd the statistical error associated with our analysis,
this curve-ﬁtting procedure was conducted many times with
counts which has been simulated base on the probability func-
tions ﬁtted to the real data. The standard error of these repeats
was taken to be the statistical error.

The probability functions for the four-photon interference
fringes were granted an additional Fourier term as they should
contain oscillations with double the frequency over the two-
photon state. These coefﬁcients do not have an expression in
terms of I(cid:48). The same procedure was carried out for the post-
selected four-photon input state to perform curve ﬁtting and
error analysis.

B: Predicted F vs I(cid:48)

The dominant source of background noise in the two-
photon interference fringes we observed is accidental coin-
cidences between detected photons which did not arise from
a SPDC event. We measured the accidental coincidences
by recording the coincidences after delays had been added
to the output signals of our avalanche photodiodes such that
any pairs from an SPDC event would no longer be recorded
as a coincidence. This leaves only the rate of coincidences
caused by uncorrelated photons. We measured this rate to be
15.6 ± 0.4Hz after correcting for non-uniform detection efﬁ-
ciency. The two-photon count rate when the detectors signals
were matched was 1315 ± 5Hz which results in a probability
of a count being background of 1.19 ± 0.03%. These rates
were found by integrating over two minutes with the phase of
the HWP 0◦ and the intensity of the laser the same as it was
when the two-photon interference fringes were recored. The
errors in average count rates were found assuming Poisson
statistics and have been propagated to the error in background
probability by standard error propagation techniques.

Rather than correct for background noise, we include this
effect into our analysis such that the ideal phase dependent

two-photon probabilities, p(cid:0)
(cid:12)(cid:12)θ(cid:1) = p(cid:0)

(cid:0)

(cid:12)(cid:12)θ(cid:1), are modiﬁed to:
(cid:12)(cid:12)θ(cid:1)(1 − ζ) + ζ/2.

Where ζ = 1.19 ± 0.03% is the probability of observing a
count due to background noise. Using these probabilities we
ﬁnd the largest Fisher information to be at a different point on
the interference fringe, for the two-photon fringes the position
with highest phase sensitivity is given by:

The resulting Fisher information can be found by evaluating
Eq. (3) at this point. This gives an algebraic expression for
optimal Fisher information:

Inserting ζ = 1.19% into Eq. (8) gives the theoretical line
