Gradient Estimates via Rearrangements for Solutions of

Some Schr¨odinger Equations

Sibei Yang, Der-Chen Chang, Dachun Yang ∗ and Zunwei Fu

Abstract. In this article, by applying the well known method for dealing with p-Laplace
type elliptic boundary value problems, the authors establish a sharp estimate for the
decreasing rearrangement of the gradient of solutions to the Dirichlet and the Neumann
boundary value problems of a class of Schr¨odinger equations, under the weak regularity
assumption on the boundary of domains. As applications, gradient estimates of these
solutions in Lebesgue spaces and Lorentz spaces are obtained.

1 Introduction

It is well known that the global regularity of solutions is a classic and interesting topic in
the theory of elliptic boundary value problems. In particular, the global estimates for the
gradient of solutions to (non-)linear elliptic boundary value problems in various function
spaces have attracted great interests for a long time; see, for example, [9, 24, 25, 26, 27,
28, 36, 37] for the linear case and [1, 2, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 38] for the non-linear case.
In this article, motivated by the work in [1, 3, 4, 6, 15], via applying the well known
method for estimating the gradient of solutions to p-Laplace type elliptic boundary value
problems and some estimates established by Shen [34, 35] for the fundamental solution of
Schr¨odinger equations, we obtain a sharp estimate for the decreasing rearrangement of the
gradient of solutions to a class of Schr¨odinger equations with the Dirichlet or the Neumann
boundary condition, under the weak assumption for the regularity on the boundary of
domains. As applications, we further establish the gradient estimates of solutions to these
Schr¨odinger equations in Lebesgue spaces and Lorentz spaces.

To state the Schr¨odinger equations considered in this article, we ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition
of the reverse H¨older class (see, for example, [22, 35]). Recall that a non-negative function
w on Rn is said to belong to the reverse H¨older class RHq(Rn) with q ∈ (1, ∞], denoted
by w ∈ RHq(Rn), if, when q ∈ (1, ∞), w ∈ Lq

loc(Rn) and

[w]RHq (Rn) := sup

or, when q = ∞, w ∈ L∞

where the suprema are taken over all balls B ⊂ Rn.

It is well known that, for any 1 < q ≤ p ≤ ∞, RHp(Rn) ⊂ RHq(Rn) (see, for example,
[22]). A typical example of the reverse H¨older class is that, for any x ∈ Rn, w(x) :=
|P (x)|α, where P is a polynomial on Rn and α ∈ (0, ∞), which turns out to be in RH∞(Rn)
(see, for example, [34, 35]). Moreover, for any x ∈ Rn, let w(x) := |x|−1+ǫ with ǫ ∈ (0, 1).
Then w ∈ RHn(Rn) (see, for example, [35, Section 7]).

Let n ≥ 3 and Ω be a bounded domain in Rn. Denote by W 1,2(Ω) and W 1,2

(Ω) the
classical Sobolev space on Ω, respectively, the closure of C ∞
c (Ω)
denotes the set of all C ∞ functions on Rn with compact support contained in Ω. Assume
that 0 ≤ V ∈ RHq(Rn) for some q ∈ [n, ∞] and V 6≡ 0 on Ω. Let f ∈ L2(Ω). Then a
function u ∈ W 1,2

(Ω) is called a weak solution to the Dirichlet problem

c (Ω) in W 1,2(Ω), where C ∞

V (x)u(x)v(x) dx =ZΩ

Assume further that Ω is a bounded Lipschitz domain. Then a function u ∈ W 1,2(Ω)

is called a weak solution of the Neumann problem

if, for any v ∈ W 1,2(Ω), (1.2) holds true. Here and hereafter, ν := (ν1, . . . , νn) denotes
the outward unit normal to ∂Ω.

Remark 1.1. (i) Let f ∈ L2(Ω), 0 ≤ V ∈ RHn(Rn) and V 6≡ 0 on Ω. Then, by the Lax-
Milgram theorem, we know that the Dirichlet problem (1.1) and the Neumann problem
(1.3) have the unique weak solution (see, for example, [21, Chapter 8]).

(ii) Assume that V ≡ 0 in (1.1) and (1.3), and RΩ f (x) dx = 0 in (1.3). Then, in this

case, (1.1) and (1.3) are just the Dirichlet problem, respectively, the Neumann problem of
the Laplace equation in Ω.

However, when f ∈ L1(Ω), the deﬁnition of the weak solution to (1.1) or (1.3) as the
way in (1.2) may be meaningless. In this case, the generalized solutions for (1.1) and (1.3)
can be deﬁned by an approximating method (see Section 2 below for the details). We
point out that the study for the theory of (non-)linear elliptic boundary value problems
with L1-data has aroused the attention of many mathematicians for quite some time (see,
for example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 18, 19, 36]).

To state the main result of this article, we ﬁrst recall the deﬁnitions of the distribution
function and the decreasing rearrangement as follows. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open bounded

set and u a real-valued measurable function on Ω. Then the distribution function µu :
[0, ∞) → [0, |Ω|] of u is deﬁned by setting, for any t ∈ [0, ∞),

µu(t) := |{x ∈ Ω :

|u(x)| > t}|.

The decreasing rearrangement u∗ :
s ∈ [0, ∞),

[0, ∞) → [0, ∞] of u is deﬁned by setting, for any

u∗(s) := sup{t ∈ [0, ∞) : µu(t) > s}.

We point out that u∗ is the unique right-continuous decreasing function in [0, ∞) equiv-
alently distributed with u and, if s ∈ [|Ω|, ∞), then u∗(s) = 0, where |Ω| denotes the
Lebesgue measure of Ω (see, for example, [33, Chapter 7]).

Then the main result of this article is as follows and some necessary notions are recalled

after this theorem.

Theorem 1.2. Let n ≥ 3, Ω be a bounded domain in Rn, 0 ≤ V ∈ RHn(Rn) and V 6≡ 0 on
Ω. Assume that ∂Ω ∈ W 2Ln−1,1 or Ω is semi-convex, f ∈ L1(Ω) and u is the unique weak
solution to the Dirichlet problem (1.1) or the Neumann problem (1.3). Then there exists
a positive constant C, depending on n, [V ]RHn(Rn) and Ω, such that, for any s ∈ (0, |Ω|),

where n′ := n/(n − 1), |∇u|∗ and f ∗ denote the decreasing rearrangements of |∇u|, respec-
tively, f .

Remark 1.3. (i) We point out that the estimate (1.4) is sharp in some sense. Here we
give an example to explain this.

Let n := 3 and B0 := B(0, 1) be the ball in R3 with the center 0 and the radius 1. For

any x := (x1, x2, x3) ∈ B0, let u0(x) := |x| − 1 and

Then, by a simple calculus, we ﬁnd that u0 ∈ W 1,2

when x = 0,

and f0 ∈ L2(B0). Moreover, it is easy to see that, for any x ∈ B0\{0}, |∇u0(x)| = 1, which,
together with the deﬁnition of |∇u0|∗, implies that, for any s ∈ (0, |B0|), |∇u0|∗(s) = 1.

4

Furthermore, from the deﬁnitions of u0 and f0, it follows that u0 is the weak solution of
the Dirichlet problem

(−∆u + u = f0

u = 0

in B0,
on ∂B0.

Using calculus, we know that, for any t ∈ (0, ∞),

µf0(t) =

when t ∈ (0, 2],

which further implies that, for any s ∈ (0, |B0|),

From this and n = 3, it follows that, for any s ∈ (0, |B0|),

which, combined with (1.4) and the fact that, for any s ∈ (0, |B0|), |∇u0|∗(s) = 1, further
implies that there exists a positive constant C, depending on |B0|, such that, for any
s ∈ (|B0|/2, |B0|),

Thus, the estimate (1.4) is sharp in some sense.

(ii) We point out that we obtain (1.4) in Theorem 1.2 inspired by the proof of [15,

Theorem 1.1].

(iii) Assume that Ω, u and f are as in Theorem 1.2. We point out that the right-
hand side of (1.4) can be naturally expressed via the Calder´on operator.
Indeed, let
1 ≤ p0 < p1 ≤ ∞, q0, q1 ∈ [1, ∞], q0 6= q1 and α := (1/q0 − 1/q1)/(1/p0 − 1/p1). Recall
that the Calder´on operator Sp0, p1
q0, q1 is deﬁned by setting, for any measurable function g on
(0, ∞) and t ∈ (0, ∞),

q0, q1 (g)(t) := t− 1

which plays a key role in the theory of rearrangement invariant spaces (see, for example,
[5]). By (1.4) and the fact that, for any s ∈ [|Ω|, ∞), |∇u|∗(s) = 0 = f ∗(s), we ﬁnd that,
for any s ∈ (0, ∞),

|∇u|∗(s) ≤ CS1, n

n′, ∞(f ∗)(s)

with C same as in (1.4).

Moreover, for any s ∈ (0, ∞), let f ∗∗(s) := (1/s)R s

0 f ∗(t) dt. Then, by using (1.4), we
can also obtain another control of |∇u|∗ via f ∗∗. Indeed, it is easy to see that, for any
s ∈ (0, ∞), f ∗(s) ≤ f ∗∗(s) and

f ∗∗(s) =

where C is same as in (1.4).

(iv) As was pointed out in [15, p. 573], the particular feature of (1.4) is its independence
of concrete function spaces. Thus, it is agile enough to obtain the estimates of |∇u| in
various rearrangement invariant function spaces via (1.4) (see Theorem 1.8 below).

(v) ∂Ω ∈ W 2Ln−1,1 means that Ω is locally a subgraph of a function of n − 1 variables
whose second order derivatives belong to the Lorentz space Ln−1,1. It is worth pointing
out that ∂Ω ∈ W 2Ln−1,1 is the weakest possible integrability condition on second order
derivatives guaranteeing the ﬁrst order derivatives to be continuous, which further implies
∂Ω ∈ C 1 (see, for example, [17]).

We prove Theorem 1.2 by following the method in [15] to estimate the rearrangement
of the gradient of solutions to p-Laplace type elliptic boundary value problems. More
precisely, by the boundedness of the gradient of solutions to (1.1) and (1.3) with f ∈
Ln,1(Ω), obtained in [39] (see also Proposition 3.1 below), the Ln/(n−1),∞(Ω)-estimates for
the gradient of solutions to (1.1) and (1.3) with f ∈ L1(Ω) (see Proposition 3.2 below)
and the method of the K-functional, we show Theorem 1.2. Here and hereafter, Lp,q(Ω),
with p ∈ (0, ∞] and q ∈ (0, ∞], denotes the Lorentz space on Ω.

Recall that, for the Dirichlet problem or the Neumann problem of the Laplace equation,
the following conclusion was obtained in [15, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2] (see also [16, Theorem
3.2]).
Theorem 1.A. Let n ≥ 3, Ω be a bounded domain in Rn and f ∈ L1(Ω). Assume
that ∂Ω ∈ W 2Ln−1,1 or Ω is convex, and u is the unique weak solution to the Dirichlet
problem or the Neumann problem of the Laplace equation in Ω. Then there exists a positive
constant C, depending on n and Ω, such that, for any s ∈ (0, |Ω|),

(1.5)

|∇u|∗(s) ≤ CZ |Ω|

Remark 1.4. (i) We point out that (1.5) may not be true for some boundary value prob-
lems of the Laplace equation. Indeed, there exists the following counterexample illustrating
this.

Let n := 3, B0 and u0 be as in Remark 1.3(i). For any x ∈ B0, let

Then f1 ∈ L2(B0) and u0 is the weak solution of the Dirichlet problem

when x 6= 0,

0

when x = 0.

Moreover, from the deﬁnition of f1, n = 3 and a simple calculus, it follows that, for any
s ∈ (0, |B0|), f ∗∗

1 (s) = 3|B0|1/3s−1/3 and hence

By this, lims→|B0| log(|B0|/s) = 0 and the fact that, for any s ∈ (0, |B0|), |∇u0|∗(s) = 1,
we conclude that (1.5) does not hold true in this case.

(ii) Let Ω, f and u be as in Theorem 1.A. Indeed, for the Dirichlet problem and the
Neumann problem of the Laplace equation in Ω, the same estimate as in (1.4) for |∇u|∗
was established in the proof of [15, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2].

Now we recall the deﬁnitions of the semi-convex domain in Rn and the Lorentz(-Sobolev)

space.

Deﬁnition 1.5. (i) Let Ω be an open set in Rn. The collection of semi-convex functions
on Ω consists of continuous functions u : Ω → R with the property that there exists a

positive constant eC such that, for all x, h ∈ Rn with the ball B(x, |h|) ⊂ Ω,
The best constant eC above is referred as the semi-convexity constant of u.

2u(x) − u(x + h) − u(x − h) ≤ eC|h|2.

(ii) A non-empty, proper open subset Ω of Rn is said to be semi-convex if there exist
b, c ∈ (0, ∞) such that, for every x0 ∈ ∂Ω, there exist an (n − 1)-dimensional aﬃne variety
H ⊂ Rn passing through x0, a choice N of the unit normal to H, and an open set

(called a coordinate cylinder near x0 with axis along N ) satisfying, for some semi-convex
function ϕ : H → R,

C := {ex + tN : ex ∈ H, |ex − x0| < b, |t| < c}

C ∩ Ω = C ∩ {ex + tN : ex ∈ H, t > ϕ(ex)},
C ∩ ∂Ω = C ∩ {ex + tN : ex ∈ H, t = ϕ(ex)},

Remark 1.6. It is well known that bounded semi-convex domains in Rn are bounded
Lipschitz domains, and convex domains in Rn are semi-convex domains (see, for example,
[30, 31]).

Now we recall the deﬁnitions of Lorentz spaces and Lorentz-Sobolev spaces. Let q ∈
[1, ∞], s ∈ (0, ∞] and Ω be a bounded domain in Rn. Then the Lorentz space Lq,s(Ω) is
deﬁned to be the set of all measurable functions u : Ω → R satisfying

when s = ∞.

Moreover, we recall some necessary conclusions for Lorentz spaces as follows.

Remark 1.7. For Lorentz spaces, the following facts hold true (see, for example, [33,
Chapter 8]):

(i) For q ∈ [1, ∞], Lq,q(Ω) = Lq(Ω).

(ii) If q ∈ [1, ∞] and s1, s2 ∈ (0, ∞] with s1 < s2, then Lq,s1(Ω) $ Lq,s2(Ω).

(iii) If q1, q2 ∈ [1, ∞] with q1 > q2 and s1, s2 ∈ (0, ∞], then Lq1,s1(Ω) $ Lq2,s2(Ω).

Let m ∈ N, q ∈ [1, ∞) and s ∈ [1, ∞]. The Lorentz-Sobolev space W mLq,s(Ω) is deﬁned

by

(1.6)

W mLq,s(Ω) := {u ∈ Lq,s(Ω) : u is m-times weakly diﬀerentiable in

Ω and |∇ku| ∈ Lq,s(Ω), 1 ≤ k ≤ m}

equipped with the norm

kukW mLq,s(Ω) := kukLq,s(Ω) +

k|∇ku|kLq,s(Ω).

mXk=1

Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that Lorentz spaces and Sobolev-Lorentz spaces
extend Lebesgue spaces, respectively, Sobolev spaces. Furthermore, the Lorentz-Zygmund
space is a further extension of the Lorentz space. Recall that, for any q ∈ (1, ∞], k ∈ (0, ∞]

8

and β ∈ R or q = 1, k ∈ (0, 1] and β ∈ [0, ∞), the Lorentz-Zygmund space Lq,k(log L)β(Ω)
is deﬁned as the set of all measurable functions u on Ω satisfying that

(see, for example, [33, Chapter 9] and [15, p. 588] for some details about Lorentz-Zygmund
spaces).

As applications of Theorem 1.2, we have the following estimates for the gradient of
solutions to (1.1) and (1.3) in the scales of Lebesgue spaces and Lorentz(-Zygmund) spaces.
We also point out that the estimates for the gradient of solutions to the Dirichlet or the
Neumann boundary value problems of some (non-)linear elliptic equations in Lebesgue
spaces and Lorentz spaces were studied in [1, 2, 13, 14, 15, 27, 37, 38].

Theorem 1.8. Let n, Ω, V and u be as in Theorem 1.2. Assume that f ∈ Lq,k(Ω) with
q ∈ [1, ∞] and k ∈ (0, ∞].

(i) If q = 1 = k (in this case, Lq,k(Ω) = L1(Ω)), then, for any p ∈ [1, n/(n − 1)), there

exists a positive constant C, depending on n, p, [V ]RHn(Rn) and Ω, such that

k∇ukLp(Ω) ≤ Ckf kL1(Ω).

(vii) If q ∈ (n, ∞] and k = q (in this case, Lq,k = Lq(Ω)), then there exists a positive

constant C, depending on n, q, [V ]RHn(Rn) and Ω, such that

k∇ukL∞(Ω) ≤ Ckf kLq(Ω).

(viii) If either q = n and k ∈ (0, 1] or q ∈ (n, ∞] and k ∈ (0, ∞], then there exists a

positive constant C, depending on n, q, k, [V ]RHn(Rn) and Ω, such that

k∇ukL∞(Ω) ≤ Ckf kLq,k(Ω).

To prove Theorem 1.8, motivated by [15, Corollary 4.1], via using Theorem 1.2, we
establish a general criterion for the estimates of the gradient of solutions to (1.1) and
(1.3) in the rearrangement invariant quasi-normed function space (see Lemma 4.1 below).
Then, using this criterion, several weighted type Hardy inequalities obtained in [8, 29] and
the fact that Lebesgue spaces and Lorentz(-Zygmund) spaces are rearrangement invariant
quasi-normed spaces, we show Theorem 1.8.

Moreover, we point out that, applying the method for proving Theorem 1.8, the esti-
mates for the gradient of solutions to (1.1) and (1.3) in some Orlicz spaces and Lorentz-
Zygmund spaces can be obtained. The details are omitted here and we refer the readers to
[10, 12, 15] for the related work of the estimates for the gradient of solutions to p-Laplace
type elliptic boundary value problem in Orlicz spaces and Lorentz-Zygmund spaces.

The layout of this article is as follows.

In Section 2, we recall the generalized weak
solutions for the Dirichlet problem (1.1) and the Neumann problem (1.3) with L1(Ω)-data;
and then we give out the proofs of Theorems 1.2 and 1.8 in Sections 3 and 4, respectively.
Finally we make some conventions on notation. Throughout the whole article, we
always denote by C a positive constant which is independent of the main parameters, but
it may vary from line to line. The symbol A . B means that A ≤ CB. If A . B and
B . A, then we write A ∼ B. For any measurable subset E of Rn, we denote by χE its
characteristic function. We also let N := {1, 2, . . .}. Moreover, for q ∈ [1, ∞], we denote
by q′ its conjugate exponent, namely, 1/q + 1/q′ = 1.

2 Solutions with L1(Ω)-data

In this section, we recall the deﬁnition of the generalized weak solutions to the Dirichlet

problem (1.1) and the Neumann problem (1.3) with L1-data.

By Remark 1.1, we know that, when f ∈ L2(Ω), the Dirichlet problem (1.1) and
(Ω), respectively,

the Neumann problem (1.3) have the unique weak solutions u ∈ W 1,2
u ∈ W 1,2(Ω).

0

However, when f ∈ L1(Ω), f may not be in the dual space of W 1,2

(Ω). In this case, the
deﬁnition of the weak solutions to (1.1) and (1.3) as the way in (1.2) may be meaningless.
Thus, when f ∈ L1(Ω), we need another way to deﬁne the weak solution for the Dirichlet
problem (1.1) and the Neumann problem (1.3). We also point out that (non-)linear elliptic
problems with L1-data have attracted great interests for a long time, since they play

important roles in partial diﬀerential equations (see, for example, [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 15, 18, 19,
36] and the references therein).

Now we recall the deﬁnitions of approximable solutions to the Dirichlet problem (1.1)
and the Neumann problem (1.3), which are based on the way of sequences of weak solu-
tions as in (1.2) to approximate (see, for example, [18, 19], for the related notion of the
approximable solution).

Let W 1,1(Ω) be the Sobolev space deﬁned as in (1.6) with m = 1 and q = s = 1. Denote

by W 1,1

0

(Ω) the closure of C ∞

c (Ω) in W 1,1(Ω).

0

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let n ≥ 3 and Ω be a bounded domain in Rn. Assume that V is as in
(1.1) and f ∈ L1(Ω).

(i) A function u ∈ W 1,1

(Ω) is called an approximable solution to the Dirichlet problem
(1.1) if there exists a sequence {fk}k∈N ⊂ L2(Ω) such that fk → f in L1(Ω) as k → ∞
and the sequence of weak solutions, {uk}k∈N ⊂ W 1,2
(Ω), to (1.1), with f replaced by fk,
satisﬁes that uk → u almost everywhere in Ω as k → ∞.

(ii) Assume further that Ω is a Lipschitz domain. Then a function u ∈ W 1,1(Ω) is
called an approximable solution to the Neumann problem (1.3) if there exists a sequence
{fk}k∈N ⊂ L2(Ω) such that fk → f in L1(Ω) as k → ∞ and the sequence of weak
solutions, {uk}k∈N ⊂ W 1,2(Ω), to (1.3), with f replaced by fk, satisﬁes that uk → u
almost everywhere in Ω as k → ∞.

0

Then the existence and the uniqueness for approximate solutions are as follows.

Proposition 2.2. Let n ≥ 3 and Ω be a bounded domain in Rn. Assume that V is as in
(1.1) and f ∈ L1(Ω).

(i) Then there exists a unique approximable solution u ∈ W 1,1

(Ω) to (1.1) satisfying

that, for any v ∈ C ∞

(2.1)

ZΩ

∇u(x) · ∇v(x) dx +ZΩ

V (x)u(x)v(x) dx =ZΩ

f (x)v(x) dx.

Moreover, if {uk}k∈N is a sequence of approximating solutions for u, then there exists a
subsequence of {uk}k∈N, still denoted by {uk}k∈N, such that ∇uk → ∇u almost everywhere
in Ω as k → ∞.

(ii) Assume further that Ω is a Lipschitz domain. Then there exists a unique approx-
imable solution u ∈ W 1,1(Ω) to (1.3) such that (2.1) holds true for any v ∈ C ∞(Ω).
Moreover, if {uk}k∈N is a sequence of approximating solutions for u, then there exists a
subsequence of {uk}k∈N, still denoted by {uk}k∈N, such that ∇uk → ∇u almost everywhere
in Ω as k → ∞.

Proof. The conclusion of (i) was essentially obtained in [6] and the proof of (ii) is similar,
the details being omitted here.

3 Proof of Theorem 1.2

In this section, we give out the proof of Theorem 1.2. We begin with the following

auxiliary conclusion, which was obtained in [39].

Proposition 3.1. Let n ≥ 3, Ω be a bounded domain in Rn, 0 ≤ V ∈ RHn(Rn) and
V 6≡ 0 on Ω. Assume that ∂Ω ∈ W 2Ln−1,1 or Ω is semi-convex, f ∈ Ln,1(Ω) and u is the
unique weak solution to the Dirichlet problem (1.1) or the Neumann problem (1.3). Then
there exists a positive constant C, depending on n, [V ]RHn(Rn) and Ω, such that

k∇ukL∞(Ω) ≤ Ckf kLn,1(Ω).

Proposition 3.2. Let n ≥ 3, Ω be a bounded Lipschitz domain in Rn, 0 ≤ V ∈ RHn(Rn)
and V 6≡ 0 on Ω. Assume that f, g ∈ L1(Ω). Let u be the unique approximable solution
to (1.1) or (1.3), and v the solution to the same problem with f replaced by g. Then there
exists a positive constant C, depending on n, [V ]RHn(Rn) and Ω, such that

(3.1)

k∇u − ∇vkLn′,∞(Ω) ≤ Ckf − gkL1(Ω).

To prove Proposition 3.2, we need a diﬀerential inequality for the distribution function
of Sobolev functions established by Maz’ya [26]. We ﬁrst recall the following notions. Let
Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded domain. For any measurable function u on Ω, denote by u+ and
u− the positive part, respectively, the negative part of u, namely, u+ := (|u| + u)/2 and
u− := (|u| − u)/2. Moreover, the median med(u) of u is deﬁned by setting

med(u) := sup{t ∈ R :

|{x ∈ Ω : u(x) ≥ t}| ≥ |Ω|/2}.

The following lemma was obtained by Maz’ya in [26, Lemma 2].

Lemma 3.3. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded domain.

(i) Then there exists a positive constant C, depending on n, such that, for any u ∈

Furthermore, to prove Proposition 3.2, we need the following conclusion.

Assume that V is as in Theorem 1.2.

(i) Let u be the unique approximable solution to (1.1) and v the solution to (1.1) with f

To show Lemma 3.4, we need the following conclusion, which was established in [39] via
using some estimates obtained by Shen [34, 35] for the fundamental solution of Schr¨odinger
equations. The details are omitted here.

Lemma 3.5. Let n ≥ 3, Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded Lipschitz domain and 0 ≤ V ∈ RHn(Rn).
Denote by LΩ := −∆+V the Schr¨odinger operator on Ω with the Dirichlet or the Neumann
boundary condition. Then the operator V L−1

Ω is bounded on Lp(Ω) with p ∈ [1, n].

Now we prove Lemma 3.4 by using Lemmas 3.3 and 3.5.

Proof of Lemma 3.4. Here we only show (3.3), since the proof of (3.2) is similar, the details
being omitted. We ﬁrst assume that f, g ∈ L2(Ω), u is the weak solution to (1.3) and v
the weak solution to (1.3) with f replaced by g. Let

(3.4)

w := (u − v) − med(u − v).

Moreover, for any given t, h ∈ (0, ∞) and x ∈ Ω, let

φt,h(x) :=
∇(u − v)(x) · ∇φt,h(x) dx +ZΩ

ZΩ

Then φt,h ∈ W 1,2(Ω) and, by (1.2), we ﬁnd that

if t < w(x) ≤ t + h,
if w(x) > t + h.

which, combined with the deﬁnition of φt,h and (3.4), implies that

Repeating the proof of (3.8), we ﬁnd that the estimate in (3.8) also holds true for w−,

Let f, g ∈ L1(Ω). Then, by the deﬁnition of the approximable solution, the Fatou
lemma and the fact that (3.3) holds true in the case that f, g ∈ L2(Ω), we conclude that
(3.3) also holds true in this case. This ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 3.4.

Now we show Proposition 3.2 via Lemma 3.4.

Proof of Proposition 3.2. We prove this proposition following the method used in [1, 3, 15].
We ﬁrst assume that u and v are the solutions to the Dirichlet problem (1.1).

Let w := u − v. For any given non-negative integrable function ψ : (0, |Ω|] → [0, ∞)
0 ψ(s) ds. Furthermore, for any given r ∈ [0, |Ω|], the function

and t ∈ [0, |Ω|], let Ψ(t) :=R t

Ir(t) :=(Ψ(t)

Ψ(r)

if t ∈ [0, r],
if t ∈ (r, |Ω|].

Moreover, the function φ is deﬁned by setting, for any x ∈ Ω,

φ(x) :=Z w+(x)

Ir(µw+(t)) dt.

By the deﬁnition of the function Ir, we know that the composite function Ir ◦ µw+ is
bounded, which, together with w ∈ W 1,2
(Ω) and the chain rule for derivatives in Sobolev
spaces, implies that φ ∈ W 1,2

(Ω) and

∇φ = χ{w>0}Ir(µw+(w+))∇(u − v)

Furthermore, it follows, from the deﬁnition of the decreasing rearrangement, that, for

any s ∈ (0, |Ω|),

(3.10)

µw+((w+)∗(s)) ≤ s

(see, for example, [33, (7.1.8)]), which implies that, if µw+(t) = r, then t ≤ (w+)∗(r). By
this and the deﬁnitions of φ and Ir, we conclude that

Recall that, for any measurable function u on Ω, the increasing rearrangement u∗ :
[0, |Ω|] → [0, ∞] of u is deﬁned by setting, for any s ∈ [0, |Ω|], u∗(s) := u∗(|Ω| − s). Then
the Hardy-Littlewood inequality states that, for any measurable functions u and v on Ω,

(Ir ◦ µw+ ◦ w+)∗(t) = (Ir ◦ µw+ ◦ (w+)∗)∗(t) ≥ (Ir)∗(t) = Ir(t)

Sibei Yang, Der-Chen Chang, Dachun Yang and Zunwei Fu

Repeating the proof of (3.14) with replacing w+ by w−, we ﬁnd that the estimate in (3.14)
also holds true for w−, which, together with (3.14), implies that (3.1) holds true for w.
This ﬁnishes the proof for the case of the Dirichlet problem (1.1).

Now we assume that u and v are the solutions to the Neumann problem (1.3). In this
case, let w := (u − v) − med(u − v). Then, by repeating the proof of (3.14) with replacing
(3.2) with (3.3), we know that k∇w±kLn′,∞(Ω) . kf − gkL1(Ω), which implies that (3.1)
holds true in this case. This ﬁnishes the proof of Proposition 3.2.

To give the proof of Theorem 1.2, we need the following notion of the K-functional.
We begin with the quasi-normed function space. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded domain. A
quasi-normed function space X(Ω) on Ω is deﬁned to be a linear space of all measurable
functions on Ω equipped with a quasi-norm having the following properties:

(i) kukX(Ω) > 0 if u 6≡ 0; for any λ ∈ R and u ∈ X(Ω), kλukX(Ω) = |λ|kukX(Ω); there

exists a positive constant C ∈ [1, ∞) such that, for any u, v ∈ X(Ω),

ku + vkX(Ω) ≤ C[kukX(Ω) + kvkX(Ω)];

(ii) 0 ≤ v ≤ u almost everywhere implies that kvkX(Ω) ≤ kukX(Ω);

(iii) 0 ≤ uk ↑ u almost everywhere as k → ∞ implies that kukkX(Ω) ↑ kukX(Ω) as k → ∞;

(iv) if E ⊂ Ω is measurable, then kχEkX(Ω) < ∞ and there exists a positive constant C

such that, for any u ∈ X(Ω),RE |u(x)| dx ≤ CkukX(Ω).

Moreover, the space X(Ω) is called a Banach function space if (i) holds true with C = 1.
Let X1(Ω) and X2(Ω) be two quasi-normed function spaces on Ω. Then, for any s ∈

(0, ∞) and u ∈ X1(Ω) + X2(Ω), the K-functional K(s, u; X1(Ω), X2(Ω)) is deﬁned as

K(s, u; X1(Ω), X2(Ω)) := inf{ku1kX1(Ω) + sku2kX2(Ω) : u = u1 + u2}.

Let m ∈ N. Then, for any s ∈ (0, ∞) and vector-valued measurable function U : Ω → Rm
such that U ∈ [X1(Ω)]m + [X2(Ω)]m, the K-functional K(s, U ; [X1(Ω)]m, [X2(Ω)]m) is
deﬁned by setting

K(s, U ; [X1(Ω)]m, [X2(Ω)]m) := inf{kU1kX1(Ω) + skU2kX2(Ω) : U = U1 + U2}.

It is easy to see that, for any s ∈ (0, ∞) and U ∈ [X1(Ω)]m + [X2(Ω)]m,

(3.15)

K(s, |U |; X1(Ω), X2(Ω)) ∼ K(s, U ; [X1(Ω)]m, [X2(Ω)]m).

We point out that the K-functional was introduced by Peetre [32] in the constructions of
families of intermediate function spaces (see, for example, [5, Chapter 5] for the details
about the K-functional).

We now prove Theorem 1.2 by using Propositions 3.1 and 3.2 and the method of the

K-functional.

Gradient Estimates for Solutions of Some Schr¨odinger Equations

Proof of Theorem 1.2. We only give out the proof for the case of the Neumann problem,
since the proof for the Dirichlet problem is similar, the details being omitted.

Let

T : L1(Ω) →hLn′,∞(Ω)in

, T f := ∇u,

where, for any f ∈ L1(Ω), u is the weak solution of the Neumann problem (1.3). Fix
f ∈ L1(Ω). Then, for any decomposition f = f0 + f1 with f0 ∈ Ln,1(Ω) and f1 ∈ L1(Ω),
we have the decomposition

T f = T f0 + (T f − T f0).

By the deﬁnition of the K-functional and Propositions 3.1 and 3.2, we know that, for any
s ∈ (0, ∞),

K(cid:16)s, T f ;hLn′,∞(Ω)in

4 Proof of Theorem 1.8

In this section, we give out the proof of Theorem 1.8. We ﬁrst recall some necessary

notation.

A quasi-normed function space X(Ω) is said to be rearrangement invariant if there exists
a quasi-normed function space X(0, |Ω|) on the interval (0, |Ω|), called the representation
space of X(Ω), having the property that, for any u ∈ X(Ω), kukX(Ω) = ku∗kX(0,|Ω|).
Obviously, if X(Ω) is a rearrangement invariant and u∗ = v∗, then kukX(Ω) = kvkX(Ω).

We point out that the classical (weighted) Lebesgue space, (weighted) Lorentz space,
(weighted) Lorentz-Zygmund space and Orlicz space are all rearrangement invariant quasi-
normed function spaces (see, for example, [5]).

As a corollary of Theorem 1.2, we have the following general criterion for the rearrange-

ment invariant quasi-normed function space.

Lemma 4.1. Let n ≥ 3, Ω be a bounded domain in Rn, 0 ≤ V ∈ RHn(Rn) and V 6≡ 0 on
Ω. Assume that ∂Ω ∈ W 2Ln−1, 1 or Ω is semi-convex. Let X(Ω) and Y (Ω) be rearrange-
ment invariant quasi-normed spaces on Ω, X(0, |Ω|) and Y (0, |Ω|) be the representation
spaces of X(Ω), respectively, Y (Ω). Assume that f ∈ X(Ω) and there exists a positive
constant C such that, for any s ∈ (0, |Ω|),

If u is a weak solution to the Dirichlet problem (1.1) or the Neumann problem (1.3), then
there exists a positive constant C, depending on n, [V ]RHn(Rn) and Ω, such that

k∇ukY (Ω) ≤ Ckf kX(Ω).

Proof. By the deﬁnition of X(Ω), we know that X(Ω) ⊂ L1(Ω), which, together with
f ∈ X(Ω), implies that f ∈ L1(Ω). From this, Theorem 1.2, (4.1) and (4.2), it follows
that

This ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma 4.1.

Moreover, to prove Theorem 1.8, we need the following weighted Hardy type inequality
in Lebesgue spaces. More precisely, Lemma 4.2 was established in [29, Section 1.3.2,
Theorems 2 and 3] and Lemma 4.3 was obtained in [8, Proposition 2.9].

Lemma 4.2. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded domain, w, v two non-negative Borel functions
on (0, |Ω|] and 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ ∞.

Now we give out the proof of Theorem 1.8 by using Theorem 1.2, Lemmas 4.1, 4.2 and

4.3.

Thus, in the case that k ∈ (0, 1], the conclusion of (iv) holds true.

Moreover, when k ∈ (1, ∞], replacing Lemma 4.3 by Lemma 4.2 and repeating the proof
of (4.9), we conclude that the conclusion of (iv) holds true in the case that k ∈ (1, ∞].
This ﬁnishes the proof of (iv).
