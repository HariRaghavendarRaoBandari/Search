Introduction

1
We consider the Fisher-KPP equation [5, 6] which describes the evolution of (x, t) (cid:55)→ u(x, t):

Bramson [2] proved that if the initial condition u0(x) is such that

u(x, 0) = u0(x).

then the shape of the front around an appropriately chosen centring term mt converges to the critical
wave ω(x):

where ω(x) is the unique solution to

ω(−∞) = 1, ω(+∞) = 0, ω(0) =

(The second line of (2) means that u0(x) decays roughly as fast or faster than e−x. The third line
could be weakened considerably.)

Furthermore, if and only if u0(x) satisﬁes the stronger condition

(cid:90)

dx xexu0(x) < ∞,

then any valid centring term mt in the sense of (3) must be of the form

where the constant C depends on the initial condition u0(x).

If (2) holds then, as shown in Section 3, for each α and for each time t if it is large enough, there

exists a unique µ(α)

such that

where C is the constant from (6) and, as such, depends on the initial condition but not on α.

It makes sense to try to determine the next term in the large t expansion of µ(α)

. A famous

conjecture [4] states that

If u0(x) decays “fast enough”,

ln t + C + W (α) − 3

where they claim that, remarkably, the coeﬃcient −3

which (10) holds) ; in particular, if u0(x) ∼ Axκe−x with −3 ≤ κ < −2, one would have Bramson’s
logarithmic correction (10) but the ﬁrst vanishing correction would be diﬀerent from that in (11).
is of
order t−1/2, but, as of now, the precise value of the coeﬃcient and, crucially, whether or not it depends
on α, is still an open question.

Work is under way [7] to prove that, indeed, the ﬁrst vanishing term in the expansion of µ(α)

+ o(t−1/2),

(11)

t

The goal of this letter is not to prove (11), but to put some constraint on what the ﬁrst vanishing
correction might look like. For instance, our Theorem 1 states that for any initial condition such that
(2) holds, and any values of α and β such that 0 < α < β < 1, one has

If 2 − ˙µ(α)

t = O(t−γ) for some γ > 0,

then µ(α)

t = W (α) − W (β) + O(t−γ),

where ˙µ(α)
A natural question is of course how large can γ be chosen in (12). In the Physics literature, it is often
assumed, and without batting an eye, that when (10) holds, then 2− ˙µ(α)
t must be equivalent to 3/(2t).
Of course, one is not allowed in general to diﬀerentiate asymptotic expansions but, intuitively, if the
initial condition decays fast enough at inﬁnity, then the heat operator in the Fisher-KPP equation (1)
should smooth everything and the functions µ(α)
should be extremely well behaved for large times. It
t = O(t−1)” is a fair conjecture. To our knowledge, there is no rigorous
would then seem that “2 − ˙µ(α)
result on this, but it would imply the following Conjecture:

Conjecture 1. Pick α and β in (0, 1). For any initial condition u0(x) such that (2) holds, then

.

(13)

In Section 4, we present some numerical evidence in support of Conjecture 1 for a step initial
condition. What (13) basically means is that any term larger than 1/t in a large t asymptotic expansion
of µ(α)

t must have a coeﬃcient independent of α. In particular:
• If, as claimed in [4, 7], the ﬁrst vanishing correction in µ(α)

is of order 1/

that decay fast enough, then its coeﬃcient must be independent of α.

• The results of [3, 1] suggest that if the initial condition is asymptotically of the form u0(x) ∼
2 . If it is

Axκe−x with κ ∈ (−3,−2), then the ﬁrst vanishing correction should be of order t1+ κ
indeed the case, our conjecture implies that the coeﬃcient is independent of α.

If Conjecture 1 turns out to be incorrect and if, for instance, for some initial condition u0(x), one has
t = 2t − 3
2 ln t + C + W (α) + k(α)t−1/2 + O(t−0.99) with a coeﬃcient k(α) which is not a constant
µ(α)
function of α, then Theorem 1 below implies that 2− ˙µ(α)
is not a O(1/t) and Theorem 3 below implies
that ˙µ(α)

oscillates around 2 at inﬁnity, which would be quite unexpected.

t

In Section 5, we present some work on a solvable model in the Fisher-KPP class which was

introduced in [3]. This leads us to another Conjecture on the asymptotic expansion of µ(α)
Conjecture 2. For an initial condition 0 ≤ u0(x) ≤ 1 with limx→−∞ u0(x) = 1 and

The work presented in Section 5 suggests also that, maybe, g = 9

value is compatible with numerical simulations. However, this value for g relies on transposing by
analogy a result derived on a front equation which is quite diﬀerent from the Fisher-KPP equation,
and it remains of a very speculative nature.

2 Results
We restrict ourselves to initial conditions u0(x) such that (2) holds. Pick α ∈ (0, 1) and introduce

ηt = 2 − ˙µ(α)
Implicitly, ηt depends on α. One has, for large time [6, 8],

Φ(0) = 0,

(28)
• The results above concern only convergence for negative x. However, in each Theorem, we could
replace the “maxx∈[−x0,0]” by a “maxx≤x0” if one assume that the hypothesis on µ(α)
does not
hold only for the one value of α that we pick, but holds in fact for all values of α (as in “there
exists a γ such that (18) or (25) hold for all α”, or “(21) holds for all α”). Indeed, one would
simply have to apply the Theorems as written above once for an α(cid:48) small enough to encompass
what happens at x = x0, another time for an α(cid:48)(cid:48) larger than 1/2, and then glue together the
results.

t

Φ(−∞) = 0.

• The theorems do not assume that u0(x) is such that we are in the regime (5) with the − 3

2 ln t of

Bramson. It merely assumes that the critical travelling wave ω is reached.

• With Theorem 1, it would be suﬃcient to prove that 2 − ˙µ(α)

t = O(t−1) for any α ∈ (0, 1) to

obtain Conjecture 1.

3 Proofs

We start by proving the following result which was mentioned in the introduction
Lemma 1. Suppose that the initial condition u0(x) is such that (2) holds and ﬁx α ∈ (0, 1). Then,
for t large enough, µ(α)
is diﬀerentiable.

t

t

Proof. Recall (3): there exists mt such that,

u(mt + x, t) → ω(x) uniformly in x.
A standard result (see for instance [8, Theorem 9.1]) gives then that

(29)

∂xu(mt + x, t) → ω(cid:48)(x)

locally uniformly in x.

(30)
For any t > 0 the function x (cid:55)→ u(x, t) is continuous and interpolates between 1 and 0 so for each t
there exists at least one x such that u(mt + x, t) = α. For each  > 0, if time is large enough, then
u(mt + x, t) = α implies that |x − W (α)| ≤  because of the uniform convergence (29). As ω(cid:48)(x) is
negative and bounded away from 0 on [W (α) − , W (α) + ] then ∂xu(mt + x, t) is negative on the same
interval for t large enough because of (30). This implies that for t large enough there exists a unique x
such that u(mt + x, t) = α or, equivalently, a unique µ(α)
, t) = α. The diﬀerentiability
of t (cid:55)→ µ(α)

is then a consequence of the implicit function Theorem.

We now turn to the proofs of the Theorems. Pick α ∈ (0, 1) and an initial condition u0(x) satisfying

(2). Introduce

(37)
The condition r(0, t) = 0 eﬀectively decouples the domains x ≤ 0 and x ≥ 0. We can therefore
consider (37) for x ≤ 0 only. A key step in our proofs is the following:
Proposition 1. With u0(x) satisfying (2), there exists two positive constants c and t0 such that

r(0, t) = 0.

eαt0 + c

du|ηu|eαu

for all t ≥ t0.

Furthermore, if α > 1/2, there exists two other positive constants c and t0 such that

The right-hand-sides in (38) and (39) can then be estimated with the following Lemma:

For large time,

• If ϕt = O(t−γ) for some γ > 0, then Rt = O(t−γ),

if α >

(41)

which is (19) of Theorem 1.

The ﬁrst part of Theorem 3 is also very easy. Assuming (25), then one has, for some γ ∈ ( 1

ηt =

t

Because we assume that ηt does not change sign for t large enough, one can push the absolute values
around ηt in (38) and (39) outside the integral. Then, applying Lemma 2 to each of the three terms
composing ηt in (42), one reaches again the conclusion (41) which is (26) in Theorem 3.
β ∈ (α, 1). By deﬁnition,

The second parts of Theorems 1 and 3 are then direct consequences of their ﬁrst parts. Pick

with non-zero derivative, one must have

t − µ(α)

t

t − µ(α)
µ(β)

t = W (β) − W (α) + O(t−γ),

(44)

which is the second part (20) of Theorem 1. The conclusion (44) also holds for Theorem 3; combined
with its hypothesis (25), it gives the second part (27) of Theorem 3.

Therefore, it only remains to prove Proposition 1 and Lemma 2 to complete the proofs of Theo-

rems 1 and 3.

Proof of Proposition 1. Recall equation (37) followed by r,

xr − (2˜ω + δ)r + (r − ˜ω(cid:48)ex)ηt − ηt∂xr,
We only consider the side x ≤ 0. Since r(x, t) = exδ(x, t) we have

∂tr = ∂2

r(0, t) = 0.

|r(x, t)| ≤ 1

for all t and all x ≤ 0.

Furthermore, −˜ω(cid:48)(x)ex > 0 is bounded for x ≤ 0 so there exists a c such that

|r(x, t) − ˜ω(cid:48)(x)ex| ≤ c

for all t and all x ≤ 0.

Also, there exists a t0 such that

2˜ω(x) + δ(x, t) > α

for t ≥ t0 and x ≤ 0.

6

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

Indeed, ˜ω(x) ≥ α for x ≤ 0, and δ(x, t) converges uniformly to 0.
because of (46) and (47) one has for all x ≤ 0 and all t ≥ t0

With these ingredients we are ready to apply the comparison principle. It goes in two steps; ﬁrst,

r(x, t) ≤ ˆr(x, t) where ∂tˆr = ∂2

xˆr − (2˜ω + δ)ˆr + c|ηt| − ηt∂xˆr,

ˆr(x, t0) = 1,

ˆr(0, t) = 0.

(49)

Clearly, ˆr cannot become negative. Then, one gets with (48) that for any non-negative function bt

ˆr(x, t) ≤ r(x, t) where ∂tr = ∂2

r(x, t0) = 1,

r(0, t) = bt.

(50)

We choose bt so that r remains x independent, which leads to ∂tr = −αr + c|ηt| or

xr − αr + c|ηt| − ηt∂xr,

(cid:19)

r(·, t) = e−αt

eαt0 + c

du|ηu|eαu

.

(51)

Similarly, one shows that −r(x, t) ≤ ˆr(x, t) ≤ r(·, t), which concludes the proof.
Finally, we prove the second part of Proposition 1 in exactly the same way than the ﬁrst part,
but starting from (34) instead of (37). As above, one ﬁrst shows that δ ≤ ˆδ where ˆδ follows the same
equation as δ but with the −˜ω(cid:48)ηt replaced by c|ηt|. Then, ˆδ ≤ δ where we replace −(2˜ω − 1 + δ)δ by
−(α − 1

2 )δ. Indeed, for all x < 0, one has 2˜ω(x) − 1 ≥ 2α − 1 and for t large enough |δ| ≤ α − 1

˜ϕt > 0,

ln ˜ϕt is convex for t > t0,

If one assumes now that ϕt = O( ˜ϕt) where ˜ϕt satisﬁes (53), then we conclude that Rt = O( ˜ϕt).
As the functions ˜ϕt = t−γ with γ > 0 satisfy these conditions, we have proved the second bullet

Proof of Theorem 2. Write

(cid:2)Ψ(x) + s(x, t)(cid:3).

r(x, t) = ηt

Then, by substituting into (37) and after division by ηt,

(cid:2)Ψ + s(cid:3) + ∂ts = Ψ(cid:48)(cid:48) + ∂2

(58)

We choose for Ψ the unique solution to

Ψ(cid:48)(cid:48) − 2˜ωΨ = ˜ω(cid:48)ex,

Ψ(0) = 0,

Ψ(x) is bounded for x < 0.

(59)

Before going further, let us check that the solution to (59) exists and is unique. First notice that

(˜ω(cid:48)ex)(cid:48)(cid:48) − 2˜ω(˜ω(cid:48)ex) = 0.

This leads to look for a solution Ψ of the form

Ψ(x) = ˜ω(cid:48)(x)exλ(x).

One obtains

(˜ω(cid:48)ex)λ(cid:48)(cid:48) + 2(˜ω(cid:48)ex)(cid:48)λ(cid:48) = ˜ω(cid:48)ex which is the same as

√
One sees from (60) that ˜ω(cid:48)(x)ex ∼ Ce

2x as x → −∞ for some constant C. Then

λ(cid:48)(x) =

We take B = 0 because we want Ψ(0) = 0. Then one checks easily that one must choose A = 0
because otherwise Ψ diverges at −∞. Finally, the only possible solution to (59) is

The proof then goes as in Theorems 1 and 3 by using in two steps the comparison principle. For

Ψ and Ψ(cid:48) are bounded for x ≤ 0. For large time, δ(x, t) goes uniformly to zero. ηt is known [6, 8] to
go to zero and, by hypothesis, ˙ηt/ηt also goes to 0. We conclude that there exists a positive function
t (cid:55)→ t which vanishes as t → ∞ and such that the term in square brackets in (67) lies for all x ≤ 0 in
the interval [−t, t].
any t0, for all x ≤ 0 and all t ≥ t0, one has
s(x, t) ≤ ˆs(x, t) where ∂tˆs = ∂2
ˆs(0, t) = 0, (68)
where c is chosen such that s(x, t0) ≤ c for all x ≤ 0. It is clear that ˆs cannot become negative. Notice
now, as before, that the big parenthesis in the equation above is larger than α for t ≥ t0 if t0 is chosen
large enough, uniformly in x ≤ 0. Then, for any non-negative function bt,

4 Numerical evidence in support of Conjecture 1

To better understand the behaviour of the µ(α)
lattice with steps a and b, we simulated the following equation:

(cid:104)

We present here results for a = 0.1 and b = 0.002, but we also checked other values of a and b and
obtained similar results.
If one linearises (77) and looks for solutions of the form e−γ(x−vt), one obtains the following relation

between v and γ:

from which one computes the critical velocity vc = v(γc):

For a = 0.1 and b = 0.002,

vc = 1.99684036732 . . . ,

γc = 1.00074727697 . . .

(79)

With a and b small, equation (77) is close in some sense to the Fisher-KPP equation and the critical
velocity and critical rate are close to 2 and 1.

√

We simulated the front with a step initial condition. It is expected that the relaxation of the front
towards its critical travelling wave is built from what happens in a region of size 2
t ahead of the
front. It is therefore critical to have a good numerical precision for the small values of h. For this
reason, the data actually stored in the computer’s memory is ln h rather than h itself. On the left of
the front, each time ln h was greater than −10−16, then ln h was set to 0. On the right of the front,
the values of h were computed only up to the position vct + 10
t + 50; the values of h on the right of
that boundary were approximated to be zero. The simulation was run up to time 85 000.

√

At each time-step, to measure µ(α)

t with a sub-lattice resolution, the computer looked at the four
values of ln h which are the closest to ln α (two above ln α, and two below ln α). From this four values,
the interpolating polynomial of degree 3 was built, and the chosen value for µ(α)
t was the one for which
this interpolating polynomial gave ln α.

Figure 1 shows a graph of µ(1/2)

as a function of 1/t for diﬀerent values of α for times larger
than 103. On this scale, the data give some straight lines, suggesting that µ(1/2)
t minus its large
√
time limit is of order 1/t. This suggests strongly that Conjecture 1 holds for the step initial condition
and, therefore, that if there is a 1/

5 An exact expansion for a discrete solvable model

In this section, we give some arguments in support of Conjecture 2. To that end, we swap the Fisher-
KPP equation we have been studying above for a model on a space lattice with continuous time which
was ﬁrst introduced in [3] as a front in the universality class of the Fisher-KPP equation: with x ∈ Z
and t ≥ 0,

(cid:40)

∂tu(x, t) =

0
u(x, t) + au(x − 1, t)

if u(x, t) = 1
if u(x, t) < 1.

For this front, the function v(γ) is given by

v(γ) =

(cid:2)1 + eγ(cid:3),

γ

from which one obtains vc and γc.

As in [3], we only consider initial conditions u0(x) such that
u0(x) ∈ [0, 1) for x ≥ 1,

u0(x) = 1 for x ≤ 0,

u0(x + 1) ≤ u0(x),

the coeﬃcient of the (ln t)/t term should be independent of α. If one assumes that (85) also holds for
the Fisher-KPP, one obtains, with γc = 1, v(cid:48)(cid:48)(γc) = 2 and v(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)(γc) = −6, that

(Of course, we used vc and γc given by (79). Similarly, the value used for d(cid:48) is not 3
π but the
value given in (85).) We then ﬁtted (using gnuplot) the δ(α)
to extract the parameters we needed.
Performing this ﬁt is diﬃcult: we ﬁt against asymptotic expansions, so we need to consider large times
only. On the other hand, if one ﬁts over too narrow an interval, it is very hard to distinguish between
(ln t)/t and 1/t. To overcome these diﬃculties, it seemed necessary to ﬁt over a large time interval
(to be able to distinguish a ln t from a constant) and to include more terms in the expansion to gain
in accuracy at smaller times. To allow the reader to better evaluate our numerical results, we present
results for several ﬁts: we used the following candidates for ﬁtting the data:

function (a), these values depend a lot on the chosen range. This is because the eﬀects of smaller terms
in the expansion is not negligible enough for the values of t that we could reach. Function (b) seems
to suﬀer a little bit from this eﬀect, but to a much lesser extent. Function (c) leads to a remarkable
