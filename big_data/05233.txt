Abstract

Based on the Goldbach conjecture and arithmetic fundamental theorem, the Gold-
bach conjecture was extended to more general situations, i.e., any positive integer
can be written as summation of some speciﬁc prime numbers, which depends on the
divisible factor of this integer, that is:

For any positive integer n (n > 2), if there exists an integer m, such that m|n (1 <

m < n), then n =(cid:80)m

i=1 pi, where pi (i = 1, 2, 3...m) is prime number.

In addition, for more prime summands, the combinatorial counting is also dis-

cussed. For some special cases, some brief proofs are given.

By the use of computer, the preliminary numerical veriﬁcation was given, there

is no an anti-example to be found.

Introduction

In 1742, Goldbach wrote a famous letter to Euler, in which a conjecture on
integer was presented. Euler expressed this conjecture as a more simpliﬁed
form, i.e., any even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of

two primes. This is the well-known Goldbach conjecture[1]. In 1855, Desboves
veriﬁed Goldbach Conjecture for n < 10000. The recent record is n < 4 ×
1018[2]. No counter-example has been found to date. Till now, the best theory
result is J. R. Chen’s 1966 theorem that every suﬃciently large integer is the
sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes[3].

A pair of primes (p, q) that sum to an even integer E = p + q are known
as a Goldbach partition(Oliveira e Silva). Letting g(E), so-called Goldbach
function, denote the number of Goldbach partitions of E without regard to
order. For example:

100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = 29 + 71 = 41 + 59 = 47 + 53

So g(100) = 6. The Goldbach conjecture is then equivalent to the statement
that g(E) > 0 for every even integer E > 1. Fig. 1 is a plot of g(E) , which is
obtained by Henry F. Fliegel & Douglas S. Robertson in 1989[5]. Hardy and
Littlewood had derived an estimate for g(E) in 1923[8]:

p>2(1 − 1/(p − 1)2) = 0.66016......

Some recent work for its lower/upper bounds could be found in [6][7]. Obvi-
ously, it is very complicated.

There are a lot of research on integer splitting, one of the most famous is
the work of the Hardy, Godfrey H. and John E. Littlewood. In 1923, they
conjectured (as part of their famous Hardy-Littlewood prime tuple conjecture)
that for any ﬁxed c > 2, the number of representations of a large integer n as
the sum of c primes n = p1 +...+pc with p1 ≤ ... ≤ pc should be asymptotically
equal to

2≤x1≤...≤xc:x1+...+xc=n

dx1...dxc

ln x1... ln xc

,

(cid:89)

p

(

pγc,p(n)
(p − 1)c )

(cid:90)

where the product is over all primes p, and γc,p(n) is the number of solutions
to the equation n = (q1 + ... + qc) mod p in modular arithmetic, subject to
the constraints q1, ..., qc (cid:54)= 0 mod p [8]. It was known as Hardy-littlewood
conjecture.

Note that, the Goldbach conjecture is only for even number. Is there any
special for even numbers? Obviously, for the other positive integers, the even
number is special since it is divisible by 2. We also know that, in the era of
Euclid, it has been proved that the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the
theorem divides any positive integer into two categories, one is prime number,
and the other is non-prime, but all non-primes can be expressed as a form
of products of some primes. So people hope to ﬁnd the secret of all positive
integer number by studying the prime number! In this paper, we will continue
this problem and extend the Goldbach conjecture to a general form, i.e., any
positive integer can be written as summation of some speciﬁc prime numbers,
which depends on the divisible factor of this integer.

2 Divisor Goldbach conjecture

Traditionally, we divided a positive integer into odd and even numbers, but
through the fundamental theorem of arithmetic we know that every positive
integer has a single unique prime factorization[9].

k(cid:89)

Lemma 2.1 (Fundamental theorem of arithmetic[10]) Every positive in-
teger n > 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers:

n = pα1

1 pα2

2 pα3

3 ...pαk

k =

pαi
i ,

(2)

i

where p1 < p2 < ... < pk are primes and the αi are positive integers.

So, from the perspective of basic theorem of the arithmetic, the positive integer
is simply divided into odd and even is very rough, since every even number
has the factor 2 for its prime decomposition, and 2 is just a special case of

3

many factors. Therefore, we can guess for other prime factors there may have
similar splittings.

Conjecture 2.1 For every positive integer n > 1 and p is a prime factor of
n, then n can be expressed as the sum of p primes , that is

p(cid:88)

n =

pj,

j=1

where pj (j = 1, 2, ...p) is prime number.

Example 2.1
(1) 15 = 3 × 5 has prime factor 3 and 5.

15=3+5+7
15=2+2+3+3+5

(2) 36 = 22 × 32 has prime factor 2 and 3.

36=7+29
36=2+11+23

(3) 56 = 23 × 7 has prime factor 2 and 7.

56=13+43
56=2+3+3+5+7+13+23

(the sum of 3 primes)
(the sum of 5 primes)

(the sum of 2 primes)
(the sum of 3 primes)

(the sum of 2 primes)
(the sum of 7 primes)

Conjecture 2.1 extends Goldbach’s conjecture to any prime factor, what will
happen if these prime factors are diﬀerent or the same?

Conjecture 2.2 For every positive integer n > 2 and if there exists a positive
integer m (1 < m < n), such that m|n, then n can be expressed as the sum of
m primes, that is,

m(cid:88)

n =

where pi (i = 1, 2, ..., m) is primes.

Example 2.2

36=3+5+11+17
36=2+2+5+7+7+13

(2) 56 = 23 × 7, 8|56 and 14|56.

(the sum of 4 primes)
(the sum of 6 primes)

(the sum of 8 primes)
56=2+2+5+5+7+11+11+13
56=2+2+2+2+2+2+2+2+3+3+5+7+11+11 (the sum of 14 primes)

Obviously this conjecture can be seen as a generalized form of Goldbach Con-
jecture, therefore we named it divisor Goldbach conjcture. The proof of
this conjecture may be diﬃcult, we mainly give some proofs in some special
cases and some empirical veriﬁcation by using computers. The corresponding

4

program code has been put in Appendix I (C language), the numerical results
can also be found in Appendix II.

As mentioned in the previous section, the hardy-littlewood conjecture [8] can
also be seen as the goldbach conjecture ’s promotion. But the above divisor
Goldbach conjecture diﬀers the hardy-littlewood conjecture since the divisor
Goldbach conjecture does not require the integer large enough and its split-
ting number is just its divisor, which is more similar to Goldbach conjecture.
However, its splitting form is not unique for any integer, which is the same as
hardy-littlewood conjecture. Next, we will continue researching this problem.

3 On the combinatorial counting problem

As we can see from the Example 2.2, 4|36 and 36 = 3 + 5 + 11 + 17, we
denote primes sequence (3, 5, 11, 17)4 be a divisor Goldbach partition of
(4, 36) without regard to order. Obviously, the divisor Goldbach partition is
not unique. By using computer we know (Appendix II)

36=2+2+3+29=2+2+13+19=3+3+7+23=3+3+11+19=3+3+13+17=...
So, for any integer number m and n, if m|n and n = p1 + ... + pm, where
pi(i = 1, 2, ..., m) is prime with p1 ≤ ... ≤ pm, then we denote the primes
sequence (p1, ..., pm)m be a divisor Goldbach partition of (m, n), and all the
divisor Goldbach partitions of (m, n) consist of the following set Sm|n,

Sm|n = {(p1, p2, ..., pm)m| m(cid:88)

pi = n, p1 ≤ p2 ≤ ... ≤ pm, pi is prime}.

(3)

i=1

Next, we deﬁne a function Y (m, n) which means the number of divisor Gold-
bach partitions of (m, n) with m|n. Obviously,

Y (m, n) = Card(Sm|n).

(4)

The divisor Goldbach conjecture is then equivalent to the statement that
Y (m, n) > 0 for every positive integer pair (m, n) with m|n and 1 < m < n.
So, Y (4, 36) = 15 since 36 can be expressed as the sum of 4 primes in 15
diﬀerent ways(see Appendix II). By the way, if m ≡ 2 in function Y (m, n), it
was just the Goldbach function

g(E) = Y (2, n), (2|n).

(5)

5

By the way, if the condition m|n is not necessary in function Y (m, n), the
function Y (m, n) asymptotically equal to[8]

,

however, it requires the positive integer n is suﬃciently large. In this paper, we
mainly study the function Y (m, n) under the condition m|n with any integer n.
Next, we proved a part of divisor Goldbach conjecture and got some algebraic
ralationship of function Y (m, n).

Theorem 3.1 For any positive integer n > 1 and if there exists a positive
integer m (1 < m < n), such that n/m = 2, then n can be expressed as the
sum of m primes and Y (m, 2m) ≡ 1.

Proof 3.1 If n/m = 2, obviously the set Sm|n has an element s = (p1, p2, ..., pm)
with pi (i = 1, 2, ..., m) = 2. So, in this case the conjecture 2.2 is correct.
Next, we prove Y (m, 2m) ≡ 1. Since Y (m, 2m) = Card(Sm|2m), we have
to prove Card(Sm|2m) ≡ 1, equivalently, the set Sm|2m has only one element
s = (2, 2, ..., 2)m.

Now, we prove this problem by contradiction. Assume Card(Sm|2·m) > 1, since
Sm|2m and s (cid:54)= s1. Note that(cid:80)(s1) = 2m, since ((cid:80) s1)/m = ((cid:80)m
s = (2, 2, ..., 2)m ∈ Sm|2·m, so there exists another element s1 = (p1, p2, ..., pm)m ∈

i=1 pi)/m = 2.
Therefore, in the element s1, there must be some primes larger than 2,and
other primes less than 2, since 2 is the least prime and there do not exist
primes that are less than 2, therefore

s1 /∈ Sm|2m.

So there does not exist an element s1 = (p1, p2, ..., pm)m ∈ Sm|2m with s (cid:54)= s1.
So, the assumption does not hold. Note that Card(Sm|2m) ≡ 1. So

Y (m, 2m) ≡ 1.

(6)

Theorem 3.2 For any positive integer n > 1 and if there exists a positive
integer m (1 < m < n), such that n/m = p, where p is a prime number, then
n can be expressed as the sum of m primes. And Y (m, p · m) ≥ 1.

Proof 3.2 Since n/m = p, and p is prime number, let s = (p, p, ..., p)m,

obviously (cid:80) s = m · p = n. Note that the element
s = (p, p, ..., p)m ∈ Sm|p·m.

6

So, the set Sm|p·m at least have one element. So

Y (m, p · m) ≥ 1.

(7)

We have proved Theorem 3.2, when n/m = p, where p is prime number. Next,
for convenience, we denote Sp(z)

m|n as a subset of Sm|n, where

m|n = {(p1, ..., pk+1, ..., pk+z, ..., pm)m|pk < pk+1 = pk+z = p < pk+z+1}.(8)
Sp(z)

Obviously,

m|n ∩ Sp(z2)
Sp(z1)

m|n = ∅ (z1 (cid:54)= z2), and ∪m

z=0 Sp(z)

m|n = Sm|n.

(9)

Let A be a ﬁnite set and its element is integer, and the maximum element of
set A, M ax(A) ≤ m, then Sp(A)
Yp(z)(m, m · p) = Card(Sp(z)

m|n = ∪z∈ASp(z)
m|n ), and Yp(A)(m, m · p) = Card(Sp(A)
m|n ).

m|n , also we denote

(10)

Obviously, we can derive

Yp(m)(m, m · p) = 1, and Yp(m−1)(m, m · p) = 0 (m > 1).

Clearly,

Y (m, m · p) =

m(cid:88)

i=0

Yp(i)(m, m · p).

(11)

(12)

When n/m = p and (n + p)/(m + 1) = p, where p is prime number, we can
got the set Sm|n and the set S(m+1)|(n+p), and deﬁne a function f

f : Sm|n −→ S(m+1)|(n+p) − Sp(0)

(m+1)|(n+p),

Let sm ∈ Sp(z)

m|n , sm+1 ∈ Sp(z+1)

sm =

f : sm (cid:55)−→ sm+1 = f (sm).

So, for any element s ∈ Sp(z)
that

m|n , we can easy derive f (s) ∈ Sp(z+1)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p, note

f (Sp(z)

m|m·p) ⊂ Sp(z+1)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p.

So, we can easy derive that the codomain of f

Zf ⊂ S(m+1)|(m+1)·p − Sp(0)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p.

(13)

(14)

On the other hand, for any element s, s(cid:48) ∈ Sm|n, and s (cid:54)= s(cid:48), clearly f (s) (cid:54)=
f (s(cid:48)). So, for function f , its inverse function f−1 exists when Df−1 = Zf . As
mentioned in above, sm+1 = f (sm), so, sm = f−1(sm+1). And we can easily
derive that for any element sm+1 ∈ Sp(z+1)
m · p, note that
f−1(Sp(z+1)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p (z ≥ 0), (cid:80) (f−1(sm+1)) =

(m+1)|(m+1)·p) ⊂ Sp(z)

m|m·p.

(15)

So, according to Eq. (13) and Eq. (15), we can get

f (Sp(z)

m|m·p) = Sp(z+1)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p, and f−1(Sp(z+1)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p) = Sp(z)

m|m·p.

(16)

Theorem 3.3 For any positive integer n > 1 and if there exists a positive
integer m (1 < m < n), such that n
m = p, and p is prime, then n can be
expressed as the sum of m primes. And the function Y (m, n) satisﬁes

Yp(z)(m, m · p) = Yp(z+1)(m + 1, (m + 1) · p), (z ≥ 0, z ∈ Z).

(17)

Proof 3.3 When m|m · p and (m + 1)|(m + 1) · p, for the set Sp(z0)
set Sp(z0+1)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p, according to equation (16), we can easily derive that

m|m·p and the

Card(Sp(z0)

m|m·p) = Card(Sp(z0+1)

(m+1)|(m+1)·p),

(18)

so

2

Yp(z)(m, m · p) = Yp(z+1)(m + 1, (m + 1) · p).

According to Theorem 3.3, equation (12) and equation (11) we can get a dia-
gram as belows:

8

Y (2, 2p) = Yp(0)(2, 2p)

+Yp(2)(2, 2p)

Y (3, 3p) = Yp(0)(3, 3p)

+Yp(5)(5, 5p)

Adding the results we have got from the diagram, we can easily derive the
result as bellow:

......

Corollary 3.1 For any positive integer n > 1 and if there exists a positive
integer m (1 < m < n), such that n
m = p, and p is prime, then n can be
expressed as the sum of m primes. And

m(cid:88)

Y (m, m · p) =

Yp(0)(j, j · p) + 1.

4 Some empirical veriﬁcation results of Y (m, n)

In the previous section, we present divisor Goldbach conjecture as a gener-
alized form of Goldbach’s conjecture, and reseached the conjecture in a few
special cases. Next, we use computer to discover some very interesting rules
on function Y (m, n).

In Fig. 2, n -axis means integer number n > 2, and m -axis means divisor of
n, the point means m|n, all points consists of a set D (the ﬁgure only shows
the part result of this set), which is the domain of the function Y (m, n),

D = {(m, n)|m ∈ N, n ∈ N, n > 1, m > 1, m|n}.

(20)

By the way, the Fig. 2 is a kind of Sieve of Eratosthenes[11]. Because the prime
set P satisﬁes

P = {n|N ot exists integer number m > 1 let (m, n) ∈ D, n ∈ N}. (21)

As we can see from Fig. 2, each point on a line. Note that

n = k · m (k = 2, 3, ...).

The Fig. 3 has plotted the results of Y (m, n) by some numerical experimenta-
tions. According to Eq. (5), when m ≡ 2, the function Y (2, 2m) is Goldbach
function g(E) with E is even number. Note that in the Fig. 3 ﬁxed m = 2 then
we can get the plot of function g(2m), so-called Goldbach function, and it was
shown as Fig. 1. The Fig. 4 shows the value of Y (m, n) for diﬀerent m values,
as we know, the ﬁrst subﬁgure is Goldbach comet (see Fig. 1). However, it
looks very complicated. In addition, as we can see from Fig. 3 , when we ﬁxed
the quotient of n/m (let k ≥ 2), then the Y (m, m · k) may has a good regular
pattern with argument m. The Fig. 5 shows the function Y (m, k · m).

future. And by analyzing the shape of plots in Fig. 5, the function Y (m, n) is
