Elliptic boundary value problems with Gaussian white noise
loads

Abstract Linear second order elliptic boundary value problems (BVP) on bounded Lips-
chitz domains are studied in the case of Gaussian white noise loads. Especially, Neumann
and Robin BVPs are considered.

The main obstacle for applying the usual variational approach is that the Gaussian white
noise has irregular realizations. In particular, the corresponding Neumann boundary values
are not well-deﬁned in the ordinary sense.

In this work, the BVP is reformulated by replacing the continuity of the boundary trace
mapping with measurability. Instead of using variational methods alone, the reformulation of
the BVP derives also from Cameron-Martin space techniques. The reformulation essentially
returns the study of irregular white noise loads to study of L2-loads.

Admissibility of the reformulation is demonstrated by showing that usual ﬁnite element
approximations of the BVP with discretized white noise loads converge to the solution of
the reformulated problem. For Neumann and Robin BVPs, the ﬁnite dimensional approxi-
mations have been utilized before. However, here also the inﬁnite-dimensional limit is con-
sidered.

where f ∈ H−1(D) is replaced with the Gaussian zero mean white noise ˙W on D and the
boundary operator B is either of the Dirichlet type (Bu = u|¶ D ), Neumann type (Bu =
¶ nu|¶ D), or the Robin type (Bu = ¶ nu|¶ D + b u|¶ D for b ∈ R). The constant l
in (1) is
positive for simplicity.

The study of stochastic elliptic boundary value problems (1) initiated from works of
Walsh [26,27] who considered solvability of the Poisson equation with zero Dirichlet bound-
ary condition and the white noise source. Walsh studied the very weak formulation of (1) in
the sense of generalized functions, that is, distributions.

In the case of the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition Bu = u|¶ D = 0 and the
white noise load f = ˙W , the existence and uniqueness of pathwise continuous solution of
(1) is well-known for d = 1, 2, 3, even for nonlinear equations by results of Buckdahn and
Pardoux [9]. The corresponding Neumann and Robin problems are less extensively studied,
although there are numerous studies on elliptic BVPs with more regular deterministic loads.
This leaves a gap in the literature which appears for example in connection with Bayesian
statistical inverse problems, where solutions of stochastic BVPs serve as priors [21]. The
aim of this work is to provide a rigorous description of the stochastic BVP with the white
noise load that utilizes both the stochastic nature of the problem and the existing literature
on more regular problems.

The main difference between stochastic Dirichlet and Neumann problems is the spec-
iﬁcation of the solution space. In [9], one seeks a stochastic ﬁeld X with continuous re-
alizations that satisﬁes −D X + l X = ˙W in the sense of distributions, and X|¶ D = 0. In
corresponding Neumann and Robin problems the normal derivative at the boundary is not
well-deﬁned when only continuity of the realizations has been veriﬁed, which is the main
obstacle for formulating the problem. Indeed, the weak deﬁnition of the (co)normal deriva-
tive ¶ nu at the boundary ¶ D of the variational solution u of (1) requires that functionals

in a suitable function space H, which e.g. is satisﬁed when u ∈

There are several studies on how to extend an elliptic BVP to irregular loads or irregu-
lar boundary data. In [2] and references therein, BVPs are taken to be deterministic with no
loads but highly irregular boundary values. Obviously, the above problem can be cast in such
a form. For smooth boundaries, the several proposed extensions in [2] work nicely but for
polygonal domains turn out to be problematic. A similar theme can be found in [4]. Rozanov
[22] treats random ﬁelds as Hilbert space processes, and applies theory of distributions in
deﬁning the boundary traces for C2-smooth boundaries. Smoothness of boundaries beneﬁts
the deﬁnition of distributions on the boundary. An attempt to solve the Neumann boundary
value problem with the help of Lax-Milgram theorem is made in [15]. However, the paper
does not take into account that some of the stochastically integrated functions are antici-
pating which suggests that correct formulation would involve multidimensional Skorohod
integrals. Also the interpretation of the normal derivative is left vague. A correct formula-
tion with more regular loads can be found e.g. in [3,25], but it is clear that the white noise
loads do not fulﬁll the required conditions. The work in [15] can be appreciated from the

Elliptic boundary value problems with Gaussian white noise loads

point of view of a more pragmatic question, which asks whether the white noise could be
approximated by more regular stochastic ﬁelds (in the sense of an existing limit).

The approximations of white noise in Dirichlet problems are often carried out together
with ﬁnite element methods [1,5,10,11,15,25,28]. Also, the convergence of approximative
solutions has been veriﬁed [1,5,10,11,25,28].

In [9], the homogeneous Dirichlet solution is acquired by replacing the BVP with a
Hammerstein integral equation. A similar integral equation could be written in the Neu-
mann or Robin case (see [12]) by updating the Dirichlet Green’s function G(x, y) with
a correct boundary value. In the linear case, the conjectured integral equation would be

X(x) + l RD G(x, y)X(y)dy =RD G(x, y)dWy for a stochastic ﬁeld X with a.s. continuous re-

alizations, where dWy represents multidimensional It¯o integral. This is referred to as the
mild form of the problem. However, it is not clear whether the realizations of X would fulﬁll
the boundary condition ¶ nX|¶ D = 0 in any other than mild sense. For smooth domains, a
partial answer can be found in [2] for the description of the BVP, where such a formulation
is compared to another generalization of irregular boundary values.

We proceed in different direction than in [2,4]. Instead of trying to stretch the deﬁnition
of the differentiability, we stretch the deﬁnition of the boundary trace with measure theoretic
methods. Indeed, replacing f in (2) with L2-approximations of the white noise hints that a
rigorous deﬁnition of the normal derivative of X might not call for continuity of the linear
forms (2) on H1(D) but only measurability. Similar phenomenon appears in the variational
formulations of BVPs with different boundary conditions. For f ∈ L2(D), the variational
form of the homogeneous Dirichlet BVP is to ﬁnd u ∈ H1

0 (D) that satisﬁes

measurability of the linear forms. Indeed, in the case of homogeneous Dirichlet problem,
such approximative variational solutions are known to converge in L2(W

to the correct solution [10]. The corresponding limit of the variational equations, when re-
ﬁning white noise approximations is then

The present paper contributes in this area by giving explicit formula for the normal
derivative of the solution of (1) as a measurable mapping (see Deﬁnition 5). Instead of
tackling directly the variational formulations of general BVP or trying to interpret the normal
derivative in distributional sense, we reformulate the irregular elliptic BVP so that existing
results for more regular elliptic BVP can be easily utilized. The approach also avoids the
need to provide new estimates for the corresponding Green’s functions, as is often the case
in mild formulations. For example, continuity of the solution of two and three dimensional
Neumann and Robin problems with the white noise load follows from the regularity of the
deterministic problem via well-known Gaussian arguments. Moreover, unique solvability of
high-dimensional problems is also guaranteed.

The reformulation of BVP involves Cameron-Martin space techniques. The main tool is
the method of extending continuous linear mappings L on the Cameron-Martin space of a

Gaussian ﬁeld X ∼ N (0,CX ) into measurable linear mappingsbL on the sample space of X

(see e.g. [6]). Measurable linear extensions are applied in deﬁning the boundary operators
for the Gaussian ﬁelds. T

In order to demonstrate admissibility of the reformulation, we show that ﬁnite element
approximations Xn of the solution X converge to the solution of the problem. The proof
reduces essentially to a one-liner (23), even for high-dimensional problems.

The main approach to ﬁnite element methods (FEM) with irregular stochastic loads was
introduced in [1], where the stochastic load f is ﬁrst approximated by a spatially piecewise
constant function, and then the ordinary FEM is applied (see also [10,15]). However, even
in 1D case the solutions of (1) with the white noise load are not regular enough for standard
pathwise error methods [1]. The convergence of FEM approximations is therefore recast as
a question of convergence of random variables, where several other modes of convergence
are available besides to pathwise convergence. From previous studies [10] it is known that
random ﬁelds Xn converges to X in norm

for 2D Dirichlet problem. In [11], 3D case on a convex smooth domain is considered. Also,
estimates for the speed of convergence are known [10]. Other similar works are [1,14,15,
28]. More regular loads are considered in [3,25].

We improve the previous results by replacing L2(D) with C(D) and giving generalization
to cases of Neumann and Robin boundary data. The cases of Neumann and Robin boundary
conditions are new.

The contents of this paper is the following. In Section 2 we recall known results about
Gaussian random variables and their linear transformations. In Section 3 we deﬁne the mea-
surable boundary trace and measurable normal derivatives (see Deﬁnition 5). In Section 4
we formulate the BVP and study its unique solvability. In Section 5 the regularity of the
solutions is considered. In Section 6 the ﬁnite element approximations are studied.

,S , P) denote a complete probability space. We make a standing assumption that
Let (W
all random variables are deﬁned on (W
,S , P). Moreover, all appropriate function spaces
appearing below are endowed with their Borel s -algebras. We will denote with Hs(D), s ∈
R, the usual Sobolev spaces on D and with Hs
0(D) the usual closure of compactly supported
smooth functions on D (see e.g. [19]).

In this work, we extensively use the theory of Gaussian function-valued random vari-
ables and their linear functionals. As an introduction to present ideology, we recall the basic
deﬁnitions in the case of white noise.

Let B(D) denote the Borel sets of a bounded Lipschitz domain D ⊂ Rd. Recall, that
˙W is the white noise on D if { ˙W (A) : A ∈ B(D)} are Gaussian random variables with zero
mean and covariance E ˙W (A) ˙W (B) = |A ∩ B|, where |A| denotes the Lebesgue’s measure
of A, and ˙W (A ∪ B) = ˙W (A) + ˙W (B) a.s. for disjoint A and B ∈ B(D). A common way to
construct functionals ˙W (A) is through stochastic integrals

˙W (A) =Z 1A(x)dWx,

with respect to d-dimensional Wiener ﬁeld Wx, which is a Gaussian ﬁeld with zero mean and
covariance EWxWy = min(x1, y1) · · ·min(xd, yd) for all x = (x1, . . . , xd), y = (y1, . . . , yd) ∈ Rd.

The It¯o isometry allows us to replace characteristic functions 1A of Borel sets A ∈ B(D) by

as Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance E ˙W (f )2 = kf k2

Instead of considering solutions for the elliptic boundary value problem as stochastic
ﬁelds, we take the more general approach by considering solutions (and the white noise) as
Banach space valued random variables. Let us recall some deﬁnitions (e.g. [6,7]).

Let B be a separable Banach space. A mapping X : W → B is a B-valued random variable
if X −1(A) ∈ S
for all Borel sets A ⊂ B. Denote m X = P ◦ X −1 the image measure of X on B.
Let B∗ denote the topological dual of B and h·, ·iB,B∗ denote the duality. A B-valued random
variable X is called Gaussian if hX, b∗iB,B∗ is Gaussian for all b∗ ∈ B∗.

For notational simplicity, we focus on reﬂexive B. In the case of reﬂexive B, we denote

with m ∈ B the mean of X i.e.

hm, b∗iB,B∗ = EhX, b∗iB,B∗

for all b∗ ∈ B∗ and with CX : B∗ → B the covariance operator of X i.e.

hCX b∗, b∗iB,B∗ = EhX − m, b∗iB,B∗ hX − m, b∗iB,B∗

for all b∗ ∈ B∗.

Next, we recall that the white noise ˙W is H−d/2−e

(D)-valued Gaussian random variable
for any e > 0. Indeed, almost sure realization properties of the d-dimensional white noise can
be derived by using random functionals ˙W (f ). The deﬁnition of the stochastic integral helps
in identifying realizations of the white noise as weak derivatives of realizations of the Wiener
ﬁeld. Then the random functional ˙W (f ) can be identiﬁed with the linear functional h ˙W ,f i
between a distribution ˙W and a test function f ∈ C¥
0 (D). It is an easy task to apply duality to
study Sobolev norms k ˙W kH −s(D) = ((cid:229)
0 (D) form
an orthonormal basis in Hs
0(D) and s ≥ 0. Recall, that orthonormal basis can be chosen from
a dense set, and the dual of H−s(D) can be identiﬁed with Hs
0(D) (see Theorem 3.30 in
[19]). In particular, ˙W belongs a.s. to the Sobolev space H−d/2−e
(D) for any e > 0, since
the series of variances (cid:229)
L2(D) converges (see [17], Theorem 2 in Chapter. 3) by
Maurin’s theorem (e.g. [13]). Similarly, ˙W belongs to H−d/2(D) with probability zero.

The measurability of white noise can be checked by the well-known Pettis’ measura-
bility theorem, which says that a B-valued mapping is a B-valued random variable, if it is
weakly measurable i.e. mappings hX, b∗i are random variables for all b∗ ∈ B∗. Hence, ˙W is
H−d/2−e

(D)-valued Gaussian random variable for any e > 0.

White noise ˙W has mean zero and identity as the covariance operator.

zero mean random variable whose covariance operator CX is nontrivial. Set

It is well-known that the elements of B∗m X can be identiﬁed with m X -measurable linear func-
tionals on B. More precisely, a functional on B is a m -measurable linear functional if it is
m −measurable and it has a version that is linear on a linear subspace of full m -measure. The

measurability ofbh ∈ B∗m X can be seen as follows. For everybh ∈ B∗m X there exists a sequence

above facts in the next lemma.

Lemma 1 The elementsbh of B∗m X can be identiﬁed with m X -measurable linear functionals

wherebh,bg ∈ B∗m X , deﬁnes an inner product on B∗m X and (bh,bh)m X = kbhk2m X .

The difference between just measurable and a measurable linear functional is that the
versions of measurable linear functionals are not allowed to be modiﬁed on arbitrary null
sets but only those null sets that will not destroy the linearity.

Especially, the mapping

Deﬁnition 2 Let X,CX , B, and B∗m X be as in Deﬁnition 1 and extend CX as in Remark 1. The
Cameron-Martin space of X is the set

equipped with the inner product

Hm X = CX (B∗m X )

(h, g)Hm X =ZBbh(b)bg(b)m X (db),

where for all h ∈ Hm X the notationbh means such a vector in B∗m X that CXbh = h. The corre-

sponding inner product norm is denoted with khkHm X

Remark 2 The Cameron-Martin space Hm X and the space of measurable linear functionals
B∗m X are separable Hilbert spaces for all Gaussian random variables X that have values in
separable Banach spaces (see Theorem 3.2.7 in [6]).

Remark 3 The covariance operator CX : B∗m X → Hm X is an isometric isomorphism. From the
inner product (10), we derive the bilinear form

and thus identify B∗m X as the dual space of the Cameron-Martin space. By (7) and (9),

linear subspace of full measure (see [6], Theorem 2.4.7). By density, we may always choose

for proper linear versions of b 7→bg(b) since the Cameron-Martin space is contained in every
an orthonormal basis {bek} of B∗m X that consists of functions in B∗ and the corresponding
image CXbek ⊂ B is an orthonormal basis of the Cameron-Martin space

We recall that the Cameron-Martin space of ˙W is L2(D). In general, the Cameron-Martin
space of a B-valued random variable is separable and the Cameron-Martin space does not
depend on the sample space of the B-valued random variable X (see Theorem 3.2.7 and
Lemma 3.2.2 in [6]). Moreover, since the zero-mean Gaussian X has values in B, then the
inclusion mapping of the Cameron-Martin space into B is Hilbert-Schmidt (see [6], Corol-
lary 3.5.11).

Let us recall the deﬁnition of measurable linear operator in our setting (see Deﬁnition

3.7.1 in [6] for a more general formulation).

Deﬁnition 3 Let B1, B2 be separable Banach spaces equipped with their Borel s -algebras
and let m be a Borel probability measure on B1. A mapping T : B1 → B2 is a m -measurable
linear operator if there exists a linear mapping S : B1 → B2 such that S is m -measurable and
S = T m -a.e. The linear mapping S is called a proper linear version of T .

In the case of Gaussian measures, there is a close relationship between measurable linear
operators and Gaussian random series (see [7], Theorem 1.4.5 and Corollary 1.4.6-7). In the
next theorem, we explicitly state the form of the measurable linear operators (the result is a
minor modiﬁcation of [7], Corollary 1.4.6).

Proof The proof follows the well-known lines (e.g. [6], Theorem 3.7.6). For completeness,
we provide a sketch of the proof.

First, we verify that any two proper linear measurable mappings S1, S2 : B1 → B1 that

coincide on the Cameron-Martin space of X coincide m X -a.s. on B1.

The space B2 is separable and reﬂexive. Therefore, there exists a countable subset G of

B∗
2 that separates the points of B2. We only need to verify that

hS1x, b∗i = hS2x, b∗i

m X -almost surely for every b∗ ∈ G.
The both mappings x 7→ hSix, b∗i, i = 1, 2, are linear and measurable functionals, and
they coincide on the Cameron-Martin space. Therefore, they coincide m X -almost surely (see
Theorem 2.10.7 in [6]). Hence the two proper linear measurable mappings coincide m X -
almost surely.
Next, we verify that the series is m X -almost surely convergent. Since the inclusion map-
ping of H into B2 is Hilbert-Schmidt, also the mapping T : Hm X → B2 is Hilbert-Schmidt.

Then the random series (12) is m X -a.s. convergent, since the sum of variances (cid:229)

4 Existence and uniqueness of the solution

A rough description of the Cameron-Martin space of a Gaussian random variable X leads to
a crude idea of the regularity of X.

Martin space H(m X ) can be continuously imbedded into H1(D). Then X has realizations in

Proof A Lipschitz domain is an extension domain (see Theorem A.4 in [19]). Hence, we
may apply Maurin’s theorem, which tells that the inclusion of the H1(D) into into H−r(D) is
Hilbert-Schmidt [13]. Hence, also the Cameron-Martin space can be imbedded into H−r(D)
by a Hilbert-Schmidt mapping. Hence, X belongs a.s. in H−r
⊓⊔

We are now ready to formulate the measurable form of the BVP.

Theorem 2 Let D ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain, ˙W be the Gaussian white noise on
D, r > d/2 − 1, and l ,b > 0.

There exists a pathwise unique Gaussian zero mean H−r(D)-valued random ﬁeld X that

satisﬁes the Dirichlet (or Neumann or Robin) BVP in the following sense:
1. the Cameron-Martin space H(m X ) of X can be continuously imbedded into H1(D) and

all h ∈ H(m X ) satisfy D h ∈ L2(D),

At a glance, the above reformulation may seem eccentric. However, it involves typical
elements of elliptic BVPs. Namely, the regularity of the desired solution X is explicitly
speciﬁed. This is done by requiring that (a) the sample space of X is at least in the Sobolev
space H−r(D), (b) X has a Gaussian distribution, and (c) the inclusion of the Cameron-
Martin space of X into H1(D) is continuous. The space H−r(D) may seem unnecessary
irregular, but this is not a hindrance, since local and global regularity of the solution can be
further studied and reﬁned. On the other hand, such a weak condition is easy to verify.

continuous boundary operator B for L2-loads, which are dense in negatively indexed Sobolev
spaces and X contributes to assigning probabilities to sets.

5 Improvements in global regularity

We ﬁrst show when the solutions of the BVP’s with the white noise load are square inte-
grable. According to the following theorem, the dimension of the space and regularity of the
domain have the key role.

Theorem 4 Let X and T be as in Theorem 3. Then X ∈ L2(D) almost surely if and only if
T : L2(D) → L2(D) is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.
Proof Consider an orthonormal basis {f k} of L2(D) consisting of smooth functions. Then
hX,f kiH −r,Hr are well-deﬁned random variables and we can study ﬁniteness of the expecta-

This shows the claim, since T is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator if and only if T ∗ is a Hilbert-
Schmidt operator.

Proof Let ( fk) be an orthonormal basis of L2(D). As a linear combination of continuous
functions, the random ﬁelds

6 Approximations

At this point, it is yet unclear if the generalizations of the Neumann and Robin boundary
values have any more value than mathematical eccentricity. However, we show now that
when white noise is replaced with its regular approximations, the corresponding approx-
imative solutions converge to the solution of the generalized problem. This clariﬁes the
generalizations from a practical point of view. In the same spirit, we study convergence
of Galerkin approximations of high-dimensional problems in Theorem 7. We emphasize
that such approximations are interesting, for example, as priors in numerical Bayesian esti-
mation of unknown multivariable functions [21]. Finally, we consider in this section some
low-dimensional problems as examples.

The ﬁrst convergence theorem concerns approximating the white noise only. From var-
ious possible approximations of the white noise, we ﬁrst choose the truncated sums in the
measurable linear extension of the identity mapping. However, the proof only requires L2-
convergence, and transfers therefore to a wider class of approximations.

We use the generic notation B for any boundary operator appearing in Theorem 2.

Theorem 6 Let D ⊂ Rd be a bounded Lipschitz domain, ˙W be the Gaussian white noise on
D, ( fk) be an orthonormal basis of L2(D), r > d/2 − 1 and let X be as in Theorem 2 .

⊓⊔

Next, we study different approximations of the problem arising from Ritz-Galerkin
methods. As a preliminary step, we clarify connections between certain measurable linear
forms and L2-regular approximations of the white noise. We anticipate FEM by indexing
the Galerkin subspaces with h > 0, which is typically connected to the size of elements in a
ﬁnite element mesh.

reduces to convergence of regular cases. Here the Ritz-Galerkin approximations always in-
clude also approximations of the white noise with orthogonal projections as in Lemma 4.
We focus on Neumann and Robin problems, which have not been studied before.

The following corollary shows how the speed of convergence in ﬁnite element approxi-

Proof The solution u f to the homogeneous elliptic boundary value problem (18) belongs to
H1+s(D) for some s > 0 [23] and satisﬁes

for all f ∈ L2(D). The assumptions imply then that (e.g. [8], Chapter 12.3)

where

⊓⊔

Next, we improve the previous convergence results by replacing H−r(D) spaces with
the space of continuous functions C(D) equipped with the usual supremum norm. Instead
of L2-convergence, we study weak convergence of probability distributions. We apply the
notations appearing in Theorem 7.

Theorem 8 Let D ⊂ R2 be a bounded Lipschitz domain. Let X be as in Theorem 2 and let
Xh be its ﬁnite element approximations. Assume that the the solution u f of (18) and its ﬁnite

h are such that

for all 0 < h < 1 and x, y ∈ D.

Then the probability distribution of Xh converges to the probability distribution of X

weakly in the sense of measures on C(D).

Proof It is clear from (24) that Xh has continuous realizations.

We show that the ﬁnite-dimensional probability distributions of Xh converge to the ﬁnite-
dimensional probability distributions of X, and that the family of probability distributions of
Xh on C(D) is tight.

The convergence of ﬁnite-dimensional distributions of zero mean Gaussian random vari-

We show that T ∗

d x converge to T ∗d x in L2(D). Indeed,

kT ∗
h

d x − T ∗d xkL2(D) = sup

k f kL2 (D)≤1

|u f
h (x) − u f (x)|

which converges to zero by the assumptions. Therefore, the ﬁnite dimensional distributions
converge.

Next, we verify tightness by Kolmogorov’s theorem (see [24]). By linearity

Xh(x) − Xh(y) = hXh,d x − d yi.

(26)

We insert (25) and (26) into

E|Xh(x) − Xh(y)|2 = EhXh,d x − d yi2 = Eh ˙W , T ∗

h (d x − d y)i2

= kT ∗

h (d x − d y)k2

L2(D).

By the assumptions,

E|Xh(x) − Xh(y)|2 = sup

k f kL2 (D)≤1

|u f
h (x) − u f

h (y)|2 ≤ C|x − y|2a

.

Similarly E|Xh(x)|2 ≤ C. The identiﬁcation of the limit with the probability distribution of
X is carried out with characteristic functions.

7 Conclusions

The presented methodology is an effective tool tailored for Gaussian problems and does not
directly generalize to nonlinear elliptic problems. However, the principle idea of replacing
the normal derivative at the boundary with a measurable mapping may carry over to more
general problems.
