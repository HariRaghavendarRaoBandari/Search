Abstract

We prove that there exists uncountably many pairwise disjoint open
subsets of the Gelfand space of the measure algebra on any compact
abelian group which shows that this space is not separable. As a
corollary, we obtain that the spectras of elements in the algebra of
measures cannot be recovered from the image of one countable subset
of the Gelfand space under Gelfand transform, common for all elements
in the algebra.

1 Introduction

We recall standard deﬁnitions and facts from commutative harmonic analysis
and Banach algebra theory (see [R],[Kan] and [Ż]). Let G denote a locally
compact abelian group with the dual group Γ and let M(G) be the algebra of
all complex-valued Borel regular measures on G equipped with a total varia-
tion norm and convolution product. With these operations M(G) becomes a
semisimple commutative, unital Banach algebra. The spectrum of a measure
µ ∈ M(G) will be denoted by σ(µ). We deﬁne the Fourier-Stieljtes transform

of µ ∈ M(G) as a mapping bµ : Γ → C given by the formula

γ(−x)dµ(x) for γ ∈ Γ.

bµ(γ) =ZG

The abbreviation △(M(G)) will stand for the Gelfand space of M(G) (the
space of all maximal ideals in M(G) or equivalently of all multiplicative
linear functionals on M(G)). △(M(G)) endowed with weak∗ topology is
a compact Hausdorﬀ topological space. Evaluation of the Fourier-Stieltjes
transform of a measure at a point γ ∈ Γ is a multiplicative linear functional
which enables us to view the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of a measure as a
restriction of its Gelfand transform to the set of uniqueness Γ. However,
there are many diﬀerent multiplicative linear functionals on M(G) and Γ
is not dense in M(G). The last fact is a reformulation of the well-known
Wiener-Pitt phenomenon observed in [WP] (for the ﬁrst precise proof see
[S], consult also [W],[G] and [R]).
Let µ ∈ M(G). We say that,

1. µ is Hermitian if its Fourier-Stieltjes transform is real-valued,

2. µ has independent powers if all distinct convolution powers of µ are

mutually singular.

We will mainly work with the ideal M0(G) of measures with Fourier-
Stieltjes transforms vanishing at inﬁnity and with its Gelfand space △(M0(G))
of all maximal modular ideals (multiplicative linear-functionals) which is lo-
cally compact but non-compact (because M0(G) is not unital). The spectrum
of µ ∈ M0(G) is deﬁned as a spectrum of µ in a unitazation of M0(G) which
coincides with the spectrum of µ in M(G) (this follows form the fact that all
multiplicative linear functionals extend from the ideal to the whole algebra,
see Lemma 2.2.5 in [Kan]) and hence will also be abbreviated by σ(µ).

2 Main results

We start with the deﬁnition of a dissociate set in a locally compact abelian
group.

Deﬁnition 1. A subset Θ of Γ is called dissociate if every element ω ∈ Γ
may be expressed in at most one way as a product

ω =

nYj=1

θεj
j ,

where the θi are distinct elements of Θ and εj is allowed to be 1 or −1 when
θ2
i 6= 1 but has to be equal 1 if θ2
i = 1. Every product of the above form will be
called a word with letters θ1, . . . , θn. The set of all words using letters from
Θ will be denoted Ω(Θ).

It is obvious from the deﬁnition that any subset of a dissociate set is a
dissociate set. In the sequel we will need the following elementary lemma
concerning dissociate sets.

Lemma 2. Let Θ ⊂ Γ be dissociate. If Θ1, Θ2 are subsets of Θ such that
#Θ1 ∩ Θ2 < ∞ then # (Ω(Θ1) ∩ Ω(Θ2)) < ∞.

Proof. Let us take θ ∈ Ω(Θ1) ∩ Ω(Θ2). Then

θ =

n1Yj=1

θεj
j =

n2Yk=1

(θ′

k)ε′

k

k ∈ Θ2 and the restrictions imposed on εj, ε′

where θj ∈ Θ1, θ′
k are the same
as in Deﬁnition 1. Now, let us observe that Θ1 ∪ Θ2 ⊂ Θ is also a dissociate
j which gives θ ∈ Ω(Θ1 ∩ Θ2) and of
set. So n1 = n2, θj = θ′
course Ω(Θ1 ∩ Θ2) is ﬁnite since #Θ1 ∩ Θ2 < ∞.

j and εj = ε′

From now on G denotes a compact abelian group with the discrete dual
group Γ. We are going to use Riesz products and hence we recall brieﬂy
its construction in the spirit of the introduction to Chapter 7 of [GM]. Let
Θ ⊂ Γ be dissociate and let a : Θ → C be a function satisfying −1 < a(θ) < 1
for θ ∈ Θ with θ2 = 1 and 0 ≤ |a(θ)| ≤ 1
2 for θ ∈ Θ with θ2 6= 1. We also
deﬁne trigonometric polynomials qθ as follows

qθ = 1 + a(θ)θ if θ2 = 1 and qθ = 1 + a(θ)θ + a(θ)θ if θ2 6= 1.

3

Our restrictions on the function a implies that qθ ≥ 0 for every θ ∈ Θ. For
each ﬁnite subset Φ of Θ we deﬁne the partial product

PΦ =Yθ∈Φ

qθ.

We easily see that PΦ is a non-negative element of L1(G) with norm one.
Since Θ is dissociate, the formula for Fourier coeﬃcients of PΦ is given as
follows (Φ = {θ1, . . . , θn})

cPθ(ω) =


1 if ω = 1

Qn
i=1 a(θi)(ε) if ω =Qn

0 otherwise

j=1 θεj

j

Here a(θi)(εi) = a(θi) if εi = 1 and a(θi)(εi) = a(θi) if εi = −1. By this
properties it is clear that the weak∗ limit of {PΦ} (over increasing ﬁnite
subsets Φ of Θ) exists and is a probabilistic measure which will be called the
Riesz product based on Θ and a and will be denoted by R(a, Θ). Its Fourier-
Stieltjes coeﬃcients are given by the similar formula to the one presented
above (for simplicity we write µ := R(a, Θ))

bµ(ω) =


1 if ω = 1,

i=1 a(θi)(ε) if ω =Qn
Qn

0 otherwise.

j=1 θεj
j ,

The following theorem (see Corollary 7.2.3 in [GM] and [BM]) includes easily
veriﬁable condition on the property of having independent powers for Riesz
products.

Theorem 3. Let G be an inﬁte compact abelian group and let µ := R(a, Θ)
be a Riesz product based on a and Θ. Then µ has independent powers if and
only if

X(cid:26)|a(θ)|2n : |a(θ)| <

1

2(cid:27) +X(cid:26)1 − |a(θ) : |a(θ)| >

1

2(cid:27) = ∞.

It is an exercise in calculating spectra in Banach algebras that for a
probabilistic measure µ with independent powers we have {z ∈ C : |z| =
1} ⊂ σ(µ) (consider the subalgebra A of M(G) generated by µ and the unit
and use the fact ∂σA(µ) ⊂ ∂σ(µ)). However, much stronger result is true
(see Theorem 6.1.1. in [GM] and [BBM]).

4

Theorem 4. If µ is a Hermitian and probabilistic measure on a locally com-
pact abelian group G with independent powers then σ(µ) = {z ∈ C : |z| ≤ 1}.

Following M. Zafran (see [Z]) we introduce the deﬁnition of measures with

a natural spectrum.

Deﬁnition 5. Let µ ∈ M(G). We say that µ has a natural spectrum if

σ(µ) = bµ(Γ).

From the formula of Fourier-Stietljes coeﬃcients we see that if a is a real-
valued function satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 3 then every Riesz
product R(a, Θ) is a Hermitian measure probabilistic measure with indepen-
dent powers which, by Theorem 4, gives

σ(R(a, Θ)) = {z ∈ C : |z| ≤ 1}.

In particular, since in this case the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of R(a, Θ) is
real-valued, the Riesz product R(a, Θ) does not have a natural spectrum (for
the same conclusion restricted to G = T see Theorem 3.9 in [Z]).
We are going to use the main theorem from the Zafran’s paper (see Theorem
3.2 in [Z]).

Theorem 6. Let G be a compact abelian group. Let

C := {µ ∈ M0(G) : σ(µ) =bµ(Γ) = bµ(Γ) ∪ {0}}.

Then the following holds true:

1. If h ∈ △(M0(G)) \ Γ then h(µ) = 0 for µ ∈ C .

2. C is a closed ideal in M0(G).

3. △(C ) = Γ.

The last ingredient for our proof is an observation of Sierpiński.

Fact 7. There exists uncountably many inﬁnite subsets of natural numbers
such that the intersection of each two is ﬁnite.

We are ready now to state and proof our main theorem

5

Theorem 8. Let G be a compact abelian group. Then △(M0(G)) contains
uncountably many pairwise disjoint open subsets. In particular, △(M0(G))
is not separable.

Proof. Let Θ be an inﬁnite countable dissociate subset of Γ enumerated by
natural numbers. Then, by the observation of Sierpiński it contains un-
countably many inﬁnite subsets {Θα}α∈R such that the intersection of each
two is ﬁnite. For α ∈ R we form an auxiliary function bα : Θα → N by
the following recipe: bα(θ) is equal to the index of θ in Θα (for example, if
Θα = {θ3k : k ∈ N} then bα(θ3k ) = k). Also, for every α ∈ R, let us deﬁne a
function aα : Θα → R by the following formula

aα(θ) =

1

ln(bα(θ) + 5)

.

Let us form a family measures µα := R(aα, Θα). Then, for every α ∈ R we
have µα ∈ M0(G) and also

suppcµα = {θ ∈ Γ : cµα 6= 0} = Ω(Θα).

Since the intersection of every two diﬀerent sets from the collection {Aα}α∈R
is ﬁnite, we have by Lemma 2, #Ω(Θα1) ∩ Ω(Θα2) < ∞ for α1, α2 ∈ R,
α1 6= α2. On the other hand,

supp \µα1 ∗ µα2 = suppcµα1 ∩ suppcµα2 = Ω(Θα1) ∩ Ω(Θα2)

which shows that µα1 ∗ µα2 is a trigonometric polynomial. It is clear from our
choice of a function aα that for every α ∈ R the assumptions of Theorems
3,4 are satisﬁed and so σ(µα) = {z ∈ C : |z| ≤ 1}. Let us take now
z0 ∈ C, |z0| < 1 and z0 /∈ R. Then, there exists an open neighborhood
V of z0 in {z ∈ C : |z| ≤ 1} which does not intersect the real line. Put
−1(V ) ⊂ △(M0(G)). By the continuity of the Gelfand transforms
of elements the set Uα is open in △(M0(G)). We are going to show that
Uα1 ∩ Uα2 = ∅ for α1 6= α2 which will ﬁnish the proof. First of all, Uα ∩ Γ = ∅
for every α ∈ R because the Fourier-Stieltjes transform of µα is real-valued
for every α ∈ R and V does not intersect the real line. Suppose on the
contrary that there exists ϕ ∈ Uα1 ∩ Uα2 for some α1, α2 ∈ R, α1 6= α2. Then

Uα := cµα

cµα1(ϕ) 6= 0 and cµα2(ϕ) 6= 0 which gives

ϕ(µα1 ∗ µα2) 6= 0.

(1)

6

But ϕ belongs to △(M0(G)) \ Γ and µα1 ∗ µα2 is a trigonometric polyno-
mial and all trigonometric polynomials are in Zafran’s ideal C . Hence (1)
contradicts item 1. of Theorem 6.

Let A be a commutative, unital Banach algebra with closed ideal I. Then

(see for example Lemma 2.2.5 in [Kan])

△(A) = △(I) ∪ h(I), △(I) ∩ h(I) = ∅

where h(I) := {ϕ ∈ △(A) : ϕ|I = 0} and △(I) is open in △(A). In our case,
since M0(G) is a closed ideal in M(G) we have the following corollary from
Theorem 8.

Corollary 9. Let G be a compact abelian group. Then △(M(G)) contains
uncountably many pairwise disjoint open subsets. In particular, △(M(G)) is
not separable.

To formulate our second corollary we introduce the deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 10. Let A be a commutative Banach algebra with unit and let
S ⊂ △(A). We say that S generates the spectrum in A, if for every x ∈ A
we have

σ(x) = {ϕ(x) : ϕ ∈ S}.

In addition, we say that the spectrum in A is countably generated, if there
exists a countable set S ⊂ △(A) which generates the spectrum in A.

Corollary 11. Let G be a compact group. Then the spectrum in M(G) (also
in M0(G)) is not countably generated.

Proof. Let S ⊂ △(M(G)) be any set which generates the spectrum in M(G)
and let us consider the uncountable family of measures {µα}α∈R ⊂ M(G)
constructed in the proof of Theorem 8 together with an uncountable family
of pairwise disjoint sets {Uα}α∈R ⊂ △(M(G)) used in the same proof. Then
it is obvious that S ∩ Uα 6= ∅ for every α ∈ R and so the set S has to be
uncountable.

3 Open problems

The ﬁrst problem appears immediately in view of Theorem 8.

7

Problem 12. Does there exists uncountably many pairwise disjoint open
subsets of △(M(G)) for locally compact (non-discrete) but non-compact G
(the case of G = Rn is probably the most interesting one)? In particular,
are spaces △(M(G)) non-separable for every locally compact (non-discrete)
abelian group G?

The second problem is related to Deﬁniton 10 and is of more general na-
ture. It is clear that if a commutative, unital Banach algebra A has separable
Gelfand space then the spectrum in A is countably generated. However, the
reverse implication seems to be an open problem.

Problem 13. Let A be commutative Banach algebra with unit and assume
that the spectrum in A is countably generated. Does it follow that △(A) is
separable?

Let us add two remarks concerning the last question.

For the measure algebra on the compact group, proving that the Gelfand
space is non-separable appears to be at the same level of diﬃculty as proving
that the spectrum in this algebra is not countably generated. Nonetheless, it
is not the case in general, which we can realize easily considering the algebra
H ∞(D) of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disc. In this example,
the spectrum is countably generated and the proof of this fact is trivial but
on the other hand, separability of △(H ∞(D)) is a content of the famous
Corona theorem of Carleson.
It is worth-noting that the discussed problem is solved for some important
classes of commutative Banach algebras. Indeed, let us take a commutative,
unital Banach algebra A satisfying M(A) = ∂(A) (the last abbreviation
stands for the Shilov boundary of A, see [Kan] or [Ż] for the deﬁnition) and
assume that the spectrum in A is generated by a countable set S ⊂ M(A).
Towards the contradiction suppose that S 6= M(A). Then, there exists
ϕ ∈ M(A) = ∂(A) and an open set U ∋ ϕ with the property U ∩ S = ∅.
Recalling that the points in ∂(A) have the following so-called peak point
property (for a proof, consult [Kan] or [Ż]) i.e. there exists x ∈ A and open

subset V ∋ ϕ of U such that kbx|V k∞ > kbx|X\V k∞, we obtain a contradiction
because S ⊂ X \ U ⊂ X \ V and so kbx|X\U k∞ = r(x). In particular, since

every commutative, symmetric Banach∗ algebra A satisﬁes M(A) = ∂(A)
and also every commutative, regular Banach algebra has this property, we
have a broad collection of signiﬁcant examples for which our problem has an
aﬃrmative answer. For arbitrary commutative Banach algebra the presented

8

argument shows that the Shilov boundary is included in the closure of any
set which generates the spectrum in this algebra.
