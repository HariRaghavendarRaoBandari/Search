Abstract

Background: Measurements of polarization observables for the reactions (cid:126)γp → K+Λ and (cid:126)γp →
K+Σ0 have been performed. This is part of a programme of measurements designed to study the

spectrum of baryon resonances.

Purpose: The accurate measurement of several polarization observables provides tight constraints
for phenomenological ﬁts. Beam-recoil observables for the (cid:126)γp → K+Σ0 reaction have not been
reported before now.

Method: The measurements were carried out using linearly polarized photon beams and the

CLAS detector at the Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accelerator Facility. The energy range of the
results is 1.71 GeV < W < 2.19 GeV, with an angular range −0.75 < cos θ(cid:63)

K < +0.85.

Results: The observables extracted for both reactions are beam asymmetry Σ, target asymmetry

T , and the beam-recoil double polarization observables Ox and Oz.

Conclusions: Comparison with theoretical ﬁts indicates that in the regions where no previous

data existed, the new data contain signiﬁcant new information, and strengthen the evidence for

the set of resonances used in the latest Bonn-Gatchina ﬁt.

INTRODUCTION

A critical ingredient in the understanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime is a

detailed knowledge of the spectrum of hadrons. In addition to being able to describe the

nature of resonant states, one must also establish what resonant states do actually exist.

In the baryon sector, the quark model has provided useful guidance on which resonances

to expect [1], and the general pattern and number of states have recently been by-and-large

conﬁrmed by lattice QCD results [2]. A common feature of these predictions is that there are

more predicted than observed resonances, which has led to the notion of missing resonances.

Most of the information about the spectrum of N (cid:63)s and ∆(cid:63)s was derived from πN scat-

tering reactions, and indeed in 1983 it was thought by some that there was no realistic

prospect of obtaining more information [3]. However, the development of new experimental

facilities and techniques has provided measurements sensitive to baryon resonances, partic-

ularly through photo- and electro-production of mesons. The number of measured states is

slowly increasing [4], but many predicted states remain unobserved. The current situation

is summarized in [5].

Pseudoscalar meson photoproduction is described by four complex amplitudes. Up to an

overall phase, these amplitudes as functions of hadronic mass W and center of mass meson

scattering angle θ(cid:63) (or Mandelstam variables s and t) encode everything about the reaction,

including the eﬀects of any participating resonances, and so their extraction is an important

goal. Such an extraction requires the measurement of a well chosen set of polarization

observables [6] (for mathematical completeness) to an adequate level of accuracy [7].

Photoproduction of kaons, with associated Λ and Σ0 hyperons, is worthy of investigation.

It is quite possible that through the strange decays of nonstrange baryons, some resonances

may reveal themselves, when they would otherwise remain hidden in other channels [8]. An-

other advantage of such reactions is that in the decays of the ground state Λ, its polarization

is accessible due to its self-analyzing weak decay, where the degree of polarization can be

measured from the angular distribution of the decay products.

A comprehensive set of measurements of diﬀerential cross sections, recoil polarizations
and beam-recoil double polarisations, Cx and Cz, for the reactions (cid:126)γp → K +Λ and (cid:126)γp →
K +Σ0 has been carried out by the CLAS collaboration [9–13]. Measurements of the beam

asymmetry Σ observable in these reactions have been reported by the LEPS [14] and GRAAL

4

[15] collaborations. The GRAAL collaboration also measured target asymmetry T , and the
beam-recoil double polarization observables Ox and Oz for the (cid:126)γp → K +Λ reaction only
[16].

In this article, we report measurements of the observables Σ, T , Ox and Oz for the
reactions (cid:126)γp → K +Λ and (cid:126)γp → K +Σ0 in the energy range 1.71 GeV < W < 2.19 GeV,
and the angular range −0.75 < cos θ(cid:63)
K is the center of mass kaon
scattering angle. The range in W and cos θ(cid:63)

K covered in this measurement overlaps and

K < +0.85 [17], where θ(cid:63)

extends the regions covered in the previous measurements. The results in the regions where

the current experiment has overlaps with LEPS and GRAAL have signiﬁcantly improved

statistical accuracy for all measured observables, and the measurements of T , Ox and Oz for
the (cid:126)γp → K +Σ0 reaction represent an entirely new data set.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The Thomas Jeﬀerson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, Virginia

is the site of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), which prior

to its upgrade delivered beams of electrons of up to 6 GeV. Beams of linearly polarized

photons were produced using the coherent bremsstrahlung technique [18, 19], which involves

scattering electrons from a diamond radiator and detecting them in a tagging spectrometer

[20]. The results reported here are part of a set of measurements known as the g8 run period,

which were the ﬁrst experiments to use linearly polarized photon beams with CLAS.

The experimental conﬁguration used for g8b consisted of a 4.55 GeV electron beam inci-

dent on a 50 µm thick diamond radiator. The polarization orientation of the photon beam

was controlled by the careful alignment of the diamond radiator [21]. The diamond was

mounted in a goniometer, and by orienting it at diﬀerent angles, the photon energy at which

the degree of polarization is at a maximum (known as the “coherent edge”) could be varied.

Coherent edge settings at 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9 and 2.1 GeV were used in this run period. The

degree of photon polarization was determined via a ﬁt with a QED calculation [22].

Figure 1 shows the general deﬁnition of directions. The lab axes ˆxlab, ˆylab refer to the

horizontal and vertical directions of the detector system. The coordinate system employed
in this analysis is the so-called “unprimed” frame where, for a photon momentum (cid:126)k and a

5

kaon momentum (cid:126)q, axes are deﬁned such that
(cid:126)k × (cid:126)q
|(cid:126)k × (cid:126)q|

(cid:126)k
|(cid:126)k|

ˆzevt =

;

ˆyevt =

ˆxevt = ˆyevt × ˆzevt,

as illustrated in Fig. 1. The azimuthal angle φ is related to the measured azimuthal angle of

the event ϕ and the orientation of the polarization of the photon θ by:

φ = θ − ϕ.

In addition to varying the coherent edge setting, the orientation of the photon polarization

axis could be controlled. The direction of photon polarization ˆnpol was set by the goniometer

orientation, and is deﬁned relative to the lab axes.

In practice, two settings of the orientation of photon polarization are employed: parallel
(labelled (cid:107)), where the polarization axis is in the plane of the ﬂoor of the experimental hall
(ˆxlab); perpendicular (labelled ⊥), where it is oriented vertically (ˆylab). Using these two
settings, it is possible to form asymmetries in the measurements and extract several polar-

ization observables. During the run the setting was switched from parallel to perpendicular,

to accumulate similar numbers of events in each setting. Some runs were also taken where

electrons were incident on a carbon (“amorphous”) radiator foil to produce an unpolarized

photon beam.

The target used in the g8b run period was a 40 cm long liquid hydrogen target, located

20 cm upstream from the geometric center of CLAS. The toroidal magnetic ﬁeld ran with

a current of 1930 A, which was 50% of its nominal maximum value and produced a ﬁeld of

roughly 1 T in the forward region. The polarity of the magnet was set such that positively

charged particles were bent outwards, away from the beam axis. The event trigger required

a coincidence between a bremsstrahlung electron in the tagging spectrometer and one or

more charged particles in CLAS.

The ﬁnal state particles were detected in the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer

(CLAS), which was the center-piece of the experimental Hall B at JLab [24]. CLAS had

a six-fold symmetry about the beamline, and consisted of a series of tracking and timing

detector subsystems arranged in six sectors. The sectors were separated by superconducting

magnet coils that produced a non-uniform toroidal magnetic ﬁeld of maximum magnitude

1.8 T. The placement of the detector subsystems led to a particle acceptance polar angle
range of 8◦ to 140◦.

common lab, center-of-mass and event z-axis is directed out of the page. The lab x- and y-axes

are in the horizontal and vertical directions, and the event y-axis is normal to the reaction plane.

For runs with photon beams, a start counter consisting of scintillator counters surrounding

the target region was used to establish a vertex time for an event. Time-of-ﬂight information

was measured by a scintillator array and allowed the determination of particle velocities.

The deﬂection of charged particles through the magnetic ﬁeld was tracked with three regions

of drift chambers which, combined with the velocity information from the time-of-ﬂight, were

used to deduce the four momentum and charge of the particle. Full details can be found in

Ref. [24].

III. EVENT SELECTION

The reactions of interest in this paper proceed by the following reaction chains:

(cid:126)γp → K +Λ → K +pπ

−

(cid:126)γp → K +Σ0 → K +γΛ → K +γpπ

−

,

where the Λ and Σ0 were measured via the Λ → pπ− decay with 64% branching ratio. Both
two-track (p, K +) and three-track (p, π−, K +) events were retained for further analysis. A
comparison between the results obtained separately from two-track and three-track events

7

ˆylabˆyevtˆxevtˆxlabˆnpolˆz,ˆzevtϕθφ=(θ−ϕ)showed that they were consistent, but the ﬁnal results were extracted with two-track and

three-track events combined.

Particle- and channel-identiﬁcation were performed on data from each coherent edge po-
sition. The photon energy range covered by the coherent peak was ∼250 MeV, resulting
in ∼50 MeV overlaps in the data sets relating to each of the diﬀerent coherent edge posi-
tions (1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 2.1 GeV). A comparison of the photon asymmetries in the overlap

regions conﬁrmed that the degree of photon polarization had been reliably determined, and

extraction of observables was performed on a combined set of all events passing the channel

identiﬁcation criteria.

A.

Initial Event Filter

Since the g8b run period was intended for the measurement of several diﬀerent channels,

the trigger condition was fairly loose. After calibrations had been performed, further analyses

on individual channels required a ﬁltering of events (a “skim”) to reduce the data set to a

more manageable number of event candidates.

Initial particle identiﬁcation was based on information from the drift chambers, time-of-

ﬂight scintillators and the electromagnetic calorimeter. The magnetic ﬁeld settings meant

that the acceptance within CLAS for the negatively charged pion was lower than for the

positively charged kaon and proton. For this reason, events with a kaon and a proton were

chosen as the best way of reconstructing the hyperon events, with the pion being determined
from the missing mass from the (cid:126)γp → pK +X reaction. Candidate events required one pK +
pair, with the optional inclusion of a π− and/or neutral particle. These K +Λ and K +Σ0
candidates amounted to about 2% of the total number of recorded events.

B. Particle Identiﬁcation

In order to “clean up” the remaining data, several other procedures were carried out: a

cut to ensure that the particles originated in the hydrogen target; a cut on the relative timing

of the photon (as determined by the tagging spectrometer) and the ﬁnal state hadrons; a cut

on the minimum momentum of detected particles; a correction for energy losses in the target

and surrounding material; a “ﬁducial” cut to remove events that are detected in regions of

C. Channel Identiﬁcation

Figure 2 shows the histogram of missing mass from the K + for the coherent edge setting of

1.7 GeV, after the application of the cuts outlined above. Histograms for the other coherent

edge settings are almost identical. It is clear from this ﬁgure that a very good separation of

the Λ and Σ0 can be made. Note that at a mass of 1.385 GeV/c2, a bump corresponding to
the Σ(1385) can be identiﬁed. Events with mass within ±2σ of the mass of either the Λ or
the Σ0 were retained for further analysis, where σ is the standard deviation of the Gaussian

part of a Voigtian function (a Lorentzian function convoluted with a Gaussian function).
The Lorentzian part has a width parameter γ (cid:28) σ.

and 1.193 GeV/c2 indicate the Λ and Σ0 events.

D. Photon Beam Polarization

In coherent bremsstrahlung [18, 19], the electron beam scatters coherently from a crystal
radiator (diamond), resulting in some enhancement over the ∼ 1/Eγ photon energy spectrum
observed with an amorphous bremsstrahlung radiator. The orientation of the scattering

plane is adjusted by setting the azimuthal angle of the crystal lattice in the lab coordinate

system. The relative position of the main coherent peak on the photon energy axis is set by

adjusting the small angles between the crystal lattice and the electron beam direction.

The photons in the coherent peak are linearly polarized and have an angular spread much

narrower than that of the unpolarized, incoherent background. By collimating tightly (less

than half the characteristic angle), the ratio of polarized to unpolarized photons is increased,

and a greater degree of polarization achieved. At typical JLab beam settings (e.g. coherent
peak ∼ 1.3 GeV, primary beam ∼ 4.5 GeV) the degree of linear polarization can be as high

To measure the degree of polarization in the photon beam, the photon energy spectrum

obtained from the tagging spectrometer is ﬁtted with a coherent bremsstrahlung calculation.

The parameters of this ﬁt are then used to derive a degree of polarization for the photon

beam at intervals of 1 MeV in photon energy. The ﬁts are performed on every 2 seconds-

worth of data, so that a speciﬁc degree of polarization can be associated with each event.

The g8 run period allowed the study of several channels, all of which would be subject

to the same systematic uncertainties associated with photon polarization. As reported in

Ref. [25], a detailed study of the consistency of the coherent bremsstrahlung calculation was
performed, using the reaction (cid:126)γp → pπ0 [26]. After a small correction had been applied,
an estimate of the accuracy of the calculated photon beam polarization was 3% for photon

energies of 1.9 GeV and below. At the 2.1 GeV setting the accuracy was determined to be

6%. An additional test in Ref. [25] showed that the systematic uncertainty in the azimuthal

angle of the polarization orientation was negligible.

E. Background Correction

It can be seen from Fig. 2 that the two hyperons are clearly separated, but that a small

residual background has persisted through the various cuts. To estimate the eﬀect of this

background, events were divided into 13 bins in W and 4 bins in cos θ(cid:63)

K. A function consisting

of a Voigtian function plus a polynomial background was ﬁtted to the two peaks in each of

these bins. There is a small dependence on W and cos θ(cid:63)
on average (cid:46) 2.5% for the Λ and (cid:46) 5% for the Σ0 within the 2σ cut region.

K, but the background strength is

The background can be accounted for in the extraction of observables, provided that it

has no intrinsic asymmetry between events from the parallel and perpendicular settings.

We expect this to be the case, since the background is mainly due to uncorrelated pions

that just happen to have satisﬁed the timing cuts. Events falling outside the peak regions

in Fig. 2 (and associated ﬁgures for other coherent edge settings) were examined. Photon

beam asymmetries extracted with these events (see Section IV) were consistent with zero,

and so it was safe to take the ﬁtted background fraction as a simple dilution factor.

11

IV. EXTRACTION OF OBSERVABLES

The diﬀerential cross section for a pseudo-scalar meson photoproduction experiment can

be expressed in terms of sixteen polarization observables, and the degrees of polarization of

the beam and target [23]. In the case where the photon beam is linearly polarized and the

polarization of the recoiling hyperon can be determined via a weak decay asymmetry this

reduces to

dσ
dΩ

=

(cid:18) dσ

+α cos θxP γOx sin 2φ
+α cos θyP − α cos θyP γT cos 2φ
+α cos θzP γOz sin 2φ} .

(1)

In this expression,(cid:0) dσ

(cid:1)

0 represents the unpolarized cross section, P γ is the degree of linear
photon polarization, φ is the azimuthal angle between the reaction plane and the photon

dΩ

polarization direction (see Fig. 1) and Σ, P, T, Ox, Oz are the polarization observables. The

direction cosines cos θx,y,z refer to the direction of the decay proton in the hyperon rest

frame, and α is the weak decay asymmetry. The dependence on the kinematic variables
ξ ≡ {φ, cos θx, cos θy, cos θz} is what allows us to extract the observables.

Note that, since the detection of the proton from the recoiling hyperon is used as a means

to identify the channel of interest, measurements will be sensitive to the values of all the

observables appearing in Eq. (1). It is not possible to ignore any one of the observables by

integrating over the decay proton angle; the detection of the proton will automatically bias

distributions. It is therefore imperative to extract consistently all the observables to which

the experiment is sensitive.

The net result of the preceding channel identiﬁcation analysis was a selection of events,
each of which had a unique set of kinematic variables {W, cos θ(cid:63)
K, ϕ, cos θx, cos θy, cos θz}, as
well as a ﬂag indicating which of the two settings (parallel or perpendicular) the event came

from. The events were sorted into bins of W and cos θ(cid:63)
that (cid:38) 1000 events fell into each bin.

K, where the binning was deﬁned so

For each {W, cos θ(cid:63)

K} bin, the observables {Σ, T, Ox, Oz} were extracted using an event-by-
event asymmetry Maximum Likelihood method. For each event ei, a likelihood is obtained

Li (ei) =

12

where the main ingredient is an estimator of asymmetry:
fi∆L + (1 − β)P γgi
fi + (1 − β)P γgi∆L

ˆai =

(2)

The quantities P γ, ∆L and β are: degree of photon polarization, asymmetry in the luminos-

ity for each setting (deﬁned as(cid:0)L⊥ − L(cid:107)(cid:1) /(cid:0)L⊥ + L(cid:107)(cid:1)) and background fraction, respectively.

In the above expression, f and g are derived from the cross section:

fi = 1 + α cos θy,iP

gi = (Σ + α cos θy,iT ) cos 2ϕi

+α (cos θx,iOx + cos θz,iOz) sin 2ϕi.

The details of this derivation and method are left to the appendix.

V. SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES

A. Nuisance Parameters

The quantities P γ, ∆L and β appearing in Eq. (2) represent so-called nuisance parame-

ters, since their values are not intrinsically interesting but do aﬀect the values of extracted

observables, and they have to be independently estimated. They therefore represent sources

of systematic uncertainty.

As mentioned in Subsection III D, the degree of photon linear polarization had an asso-

ciated systematic uncertainty of 3% for photon energies up to 1.9 GeV, whilst data above

that energy had a 6% uncertainty. To estimate the eﬀect of this on the extracted values

of observables in KΛ and KΣ0, the extraction procedure was run with values of photon

polarization adjusted accordingly.

The eﬀect of the variation in photon polarization has a noticeable but complicated eﬀect

on the extracted values of the observables, due to the correlations among them. However,

the percentage change in photon polarization is roughly equal to the percentage change in

the values of the observables, and for the majority of points this systematic uncertainty is

less than the statistical uncertainty.

The luminosity asymmetry ∆L is only dependent on photon energy, and so the procedure

to estimate these values was to split the data up into bins in W , and perform Maximum

Likelihood ﬁts with ∆L as a free parameter. This was done for events identiﬁed as KΛ ﬁnal

13

states and also for events identiﬁed as KΣ ﬁnal states. With these two independent means

of determining ∆L, the values diﬀered by less than 0.01, and so the uncertainty associated

with values of ∆L was deemed insigniﬁcant compared with the statistical accuracy.

As mentioned in Section III E, the background contribution to the measured events was
seen to be (cid:46) 5%. The uncertainty on this ﬁtted value was in turn only a few percent, so a
systematic uncertainty associated with the estimate of the background fraction was ignored.

B. Uncertainties in the Extraction Method

As mentioned in the appendix, the observables reported here are asymmetries, whose
support exists only within the bounds [−1, +1]. To check how imposing this constraint
aﬀects the extracted results, we ﬁrst performed an unconstrained ﬁt (Maximum Likelihood)

to check whether there may be systematic uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the

nuisance parameters. A constrained ﬁt (maximum posterior probability), which includes the

constraint, was then carried out to yield the ﬁnal numbers. There is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence

in the two results from the two methods across the entire kinematic region.

A fraction of the measured events contained ﬁnal states with three measured particles,

which we will refer to as three-track events. A comparison between observables extracted
from three-track events (π− detected) and from two-track events (π− reconstructed from
missing mass) was carried out. This was done to check both internal consistency, and

the calculation of the eﬀective weak decay constant in the case of the KΣ0 channel [11].

Both reactions studied here are identiﬁed from the detection of a kaon and a proton. In

the case of the KΛ reaction, this is enough to over-determine the kinematics, whereas the

additional photon from the decay of the Σ0 means that there is not a suﬃcient number

of measured kinematic variables to determine the rest frame of the Λ, in the decay chain

Σ0 → Λγ; Λ → π−p. A detailed calculation of how to obtain the Σ0 polarization components

for two-track events is given in the appendix of [11]. The values of observables extracted

from two- and three-track events in this analysis were all consistent with each other, within

the statistical uncertainties.

VI. RESULTS

The results presented here represent a substantial increase in world data on observables

from measurements with linearly polarized photons for the two channels. Figures 3 and 4
show the regions in {W, cos θ(cid:63)
K} space spanned by the present results, compared to previous
ones [14–16]. For the CLAS data, the symbols represent the mean value of the bin, weighted

by the number of measured events. The symbols for the previous data represent the values

reported in the literature [14–16]. In addition to this, the statistical accuracy of the present

data is a signiﬁcant improvement over the published data in the regions of overlap. A

summary of the measurements on the two channels that have been completed so far is given

in Table II.

The results for the observables {Σ, T, Ox, Oz} for the (cid:126)γp → K +(cid:126)Λ reaction are displayed
in Figs. 5-8, while the same observables for the (cid:126)γp → K +(cid:126)Σ0 reaction are shown in Figs. 9-12
[27]. Where visible, horizontal bars on the data indicate the angular limits of the bins,

corresponding to those illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4.

Also shown in the ﬁgures are three calculations. The red curves show predictions from

the ANL-Osaka group [28], which are dynamical coupled-channels calculations incorporat-

ing known resonances with masses below 2 GeV/c2, which have total widths less than 400

MeV/c2 and whose pole positions and residues could be extracted. The green curves repre-

sent predictions from the 2014 solution of the Bonn-Gatchina partial wave analysis (BG2014-

02, [29]), whilst the blue curves are the result of a re-ﬁt solution of the Bonn-Gatchina partial

wave analysis [30] of data from all channels, including the new data reported here.

For a comparison of the calculations with the data, calculations from each of the groups

were supplied on a ﬁne grid in W and cos θ(cid:63)

K. Each CLAS data point represents a weighted

average of the observable in a ﬁnite bin of W and cos θ(cid:63)

K. A weighted average of the

calculations that took into account the distribution of measured events within the bin was

evaluated. The bands observed in the plots represents the standard deviation of calculations

within the kaon angular range labelled in the sub-plots.

It is clear from the plots that there is a great deal of structure in the W− and cos θ(cid:63)

K−
dependence of each of the observables. For the two calculations that represent predictions

(ANL-Osaka and Bonn-Gatchina-2014), the ﬁts generally appear to match the data rea-

sonably well at forward angles over most of the energy range, and for W < 1.8 GeV at
backward angles over most of the angular range. These ranges in {W, cos θ(cid:63)
K} space are
where the data sets from LEPS and GRAAL were used in the previous theoretical ﬁts.

Away from the regions that overlap with the previous data, however, these predictions do

not do well in matching the data. The re-ﬁt of the Bonn-Gatchina solution does indicate a
good agreement over the whole kinematic region for the K − Λ channel, and fair agreement
for the K − Σ channel.

For the Bonn-Gatchina re-ﬁt, the resonance set in the BG2014-02 solution was used, and

data from all two-body ﬁnal states were ﬁtted. In doing this, the couplings to three-body

ﬁnal states were held ﬁxed, while all other parameters were allowed to vary. This resulted in

a reasonable description of all data, and was used as a baseline for further studies. The fact

that this ﬁt was able to reproduce the present data, and all previous data, satisfactorily can

be attributed to the fact that very small diﬀerences in some parameters, such as phases, can

give rise to large diﬀerences in some observable quantities in one channel, without greatly

aﬀecting other channels.

A comprehensive program of including one or two additional resonances in the mass region

2.1-2.3 GeVc2 was undertaken. Several hundred new ﬁts were performed, each one of which

involved the introduction of a combination of states with a variety of spins and parities.

Of these, an overall best ﬁt was found with the addition of two new resonances: N (cid:63)( 3

masses, or indeed to claim strong evidence for their existence. There were many combinations

that showed small improvements in goodness-of-ﬁt, and so the conclusion is that the new

data are suggestive of additional resonances, but further data will be required to establish

) states. However, the diﬀerence between these distributions and those corre-

sponding to the ﬁt with no new resonances is not possible to discern on the graphs; the

improvement in the ﬁt is small and is also “diluted” over several channels and many observ-

ables.

The “predictive power” of the BG2014-02 solution appears to have been poor in the

regions where there has previously been no data. However, this approach to ﬁtting data

from many channels is less about developing a predictive model, and more about being

able to extract more information from data when more data are available. It is a further

indication that polarization observables of suﬃcient accuracy will indeed be required to

extract the full physics information from these channels [6, 7].

As a check of consistency with previous measurements, we can make use of one of several

identities that connect the polarization observables for pseudoscalar meson photoproduction

[31], known as the “Fierz identities”.

work, the Cx and Cz observables were extracted independently and were not constrained to

the physical region.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

Measurements of polarization observables for the reactions (cid:126)γp → K +Λ and (cid:126)γp → K +Σ0
have been performed. The energy range of the results is 1.71 GeV < W < 2.19 GeV, with
an angular range −0.75 < cos θ(cid:63)
are beam asymmetry Σ, target asymmetry T , and the beam-recoil double polarization ob-

K < +0.85. The observables extracted for both reactions

servables Ox and Oz. This greatly increases the world data set for the observables in the
(cid:126)γp → K +Λ channel, both in kinematic coverage and in accuracy. The T , Ox and Oz data
for the (cid:126)γp → K +Σ0 channel are new, and the beam asymmetry measurements also increase
kinematic coverage and accuracy over previous measurements.

Comparison with phenomenological ﬁts of the Bonn-Gatchina model indicate that this

present data set shows some evidence of resonances beyond the 2014 solution, but that it

is not strong enough to deduce the quantum numbers or masses of these states or indeed

unpublished work, including additional polarization observables and other channels, is still

necessary to be able to untangle the full spectrum of N (cid:63) resonances.

Appendix A: Extraction of Polarization Observables

A method for estimating the values of observables was developed, which used event-by-

event Maximum Likelihood ﬁts to data sorted into bins in W and cos θ(cid:63)

K. While there are

numerous examples of event based likelihood ﬁts (either Maximum Likelihood or Extended

Maximum Likelihood), this methodology has not been used for asymmetry measurements

before, so we outline the procedure in this appendix.

The cross section, as deﬁned in Eq. (1), is a function of the hadronic mass W and the

center of mass kaon scattering angle θ(cid:63)

K. The rest of this appendix assumes that we are

discussing one bin in W and cos θ(cid:63)

K. We can re-write the cross section as:

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

σs⊥((cid:107)) = σ0

where

f − P γ⊥((cid:107))g⊥((cid:107))

,

(A1)

f = 1 + α cos θyP
g⊥ = − (Σ + α cos θyT ) cos 2ϕ

−α (cos θxOx + cos θzOz) sin 2ϕ

g(cid:107) = + (Σ + α cos θyT ) cos 2ϕ

+α (cos θxOx + cos θzOz) sin 2ϕ.

(A2)

The eﬀect of changing settings is to reverse the sign in front of the sine and cosine terms,

so we can write

g(cid:107) = −g⊥ = g.

Also, the superscript s is used to denote the cross section for signal events.

Within one {W, cos θ(cid:63)

K} bin, there is a distribution in the variables ξ ≡ {φ, cos θx, cos θy, cos θz},

the form of which allows us to estimate the polarization observables. Throughout such a
bin, we assume that there is a true asymmetry a (ξ) ∈ [−1, 1]. In a speciﬁed range of ξ, the
probability of obtaining exactly n⊥ and n(cid:107) counts in the perpendicular and parallel settings

respectively, given a speciﬁc value of a would be

(cid:0)n⊥, n(cid:107) | a(cid:1) =

P

1
Z

(1 + a)n⊥ (1 − a)n(cid:107) ,

25

(A3)

where Z is a normalizing constant.

In an event-by-event analysis, the range in ξ is such that it contains just one event. Events

can be denoted by

(cid:8)n⊥ = 1, n(cid:107) = 0(cid:9) ;

e⊥ ≡

Equation A3 would then become either of:

P (e⊥ | a) =

(1 + a) ; P

depending on the setting.

e(cid:107) ≡

(cid:8)n⊥ = 0, n(cid:107) = 1(cid:9) .
(cid:0)e(cid:107) | a(cid:1) =

(1 − a) ,

(A4)

We now need to construct an estimator ˆa for the asymmetry. It will be a function of the
variables ξ, but will also depend on the observables of interest, O ≡ {Σ, P, T, Ox, Oz}, and
other quantities referred to as “nuisance parameters” λ. These nuisance parameters represent

quantities, such as degree of photon polarization, that must be determined independently

and give rise to systematic uncertainties.

The measured number of counts in each setting will be related to the detector acceptance,

the integrated luminosity and the cross section, so the expected numbers will be:

n⊥((cid:107)) = ε⊥((cid:107))L⊥((cid:107))σc⊥((cid:107)).

ε⊥((cid:107)) is the acceptance and L⊥((cid:107)) the luminosity. The expected asymmetry of counts is then:

∆n =

n⊥ − n(cid:107)
n⊥ + n(cid:107)

=

ε⊥L⊥σc⊥ − ε(cid:107)L(cid:107)σc(cid:107)
ε⊥L⊥σc⊥ + ε(cid:107)L(cid:107)σc(cid:107)

.

(A5)

The detector does not measure the photon polarization direction, so the acceptance for a

phase-space volume in both settings is the same; it can therefore be divided out.

Taking the asymmetries of cross sections and luminosities:
L⊥ − L(cid:107)
L⊥ + L(cid:107)

σc⊥ − σc(cid:107)
σc⊥ + σc(cid:107)

; ∆L =

∆σ =

,

this gives

In practice, the luminosity asymmetry depends only on the photon energy (and hence

∆n =

∆L + ∆σ
1 + ∆σ∆L

.

(A6)

W ). A preliminary ﬁt is carried out for events binned only in W , and the values for ∆L
ﬁxed for the ﬁts to individual {W, cos θ(cid:63)

K} bins.
26

The superscript c in the cross section symbols indicates that the cross section is a com-

bination of both signal s and background b:

σc⊥((cid:107)) = σs⊥((cid:107)) + σb,

where it is assumed that the background contribution does not depend on photon polar-

ization setting (as shown in Section III E). By performing a ﬁt to a mass spectrum such

as Fig. 2 for the W, cos θ(cid:63)

K bin, a background fraction factor β can be determined, which

represents the ratio of the background cross section to the average of the combined cross

sections in each setting:

This allows us to write

(cid:16)

σb

σc⊥ + σc(cid:107)

(cid:17) .

β =

∆σ = (1 − β)

σs⊥ − σs(cid:107)
σs⊥ + σs(cid:107)

,

(A7)

which can be connected with the expressions in A2.

One ﬁnal point is that since each event is treated individually, provided that an inde-

pendent estimate of the photon polarization can be made for that event, we do not need to

worry about any diﬀerence in photon polarization in each setting. So for an event i equation

A7 becomes

∆σ = (1 − β)

P γ
i gi
fi

,

and plugging this into A6 the ﬁnal estimator is

ˆai =

fi∆L + (1 − β)P γ
i gi
fi + (1 − β)P γ
i gi∆L

.

For each event measured ei, the likelihood

Pi (ei | ξ,O, λ) =

1
2

(1 + ˆai (ξi,O, λ))

(A8)

(A9)

is calculated. For the extraction of new observables, we use independently measured values
of recoil polarization P = p with uncertainties ±δp from interpolations of previous data
[12, 13] as inputs. A Normal probability density is then multiplied into the event likelihood:

Pi (ei | ξi,O, λ) → Pi (ei | ξi,O, λ)N (P | µ = p, σ = δp) ,

(A10)

so that some variation in the value of P is allowed in the likelihood ﬁtting of the asymmetry,

but in a more constrained fashion.

27

The total likelihood for all events in the {W, cos θ(cid:63)

K} bin

(cid:89)
i Pi (ei | ξi,O, λ)

P ({ei} | O, λ) =

(A11)

is maximized by varying the values of the observables O.

The likelihood function is actually the probability of the data given the parameters,

whereas what we really want is the probability of the parameters, given the data. This is

given by the posterior probability

P (O | {ei}) ∝ P ({ei} | O)P (O) ,

(A12)

where we do not care about the normalizing constant, since the function is to be maximized.
So at the time of evaluating the likelihood, the bounds [−1, +1] are encoded into a prior
probability function P (O), since the support for values of the observables only exists in
this region. This means our ﬁt will yield a maximum posterior probability estimate of the

observables.

[17] These measurements are also sensitive to the recoil polarization P , but since the measurements

of P reported in [12, 13] were of greater accuracy and covered a larger range in W , we chose

to use those results in the extraction procedure, having ﬁrst established that the values of P

that could be measured in the present experiment were consistent with the previous ones.
