We report thermodynamic properties, magnetic ground state, and microscopic magnetic model
of the spin-1 frustrated antiferromaget Li2NiW2O8 showing successive transitions at TN1 (cid:39) 18 K
and TN2 (cid:39) 12.5 K in zero ﬁeld. Nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron diﬀraction reveal collinear
and commensurate magnetic order with the propagation vector k = ( 1
2 ) below TN2. The
ordered moment of 1.8 µB at 1.5 K is directed along [0.89(9),−0.10(5),−0.49(6)] and matches the
magnetic easy axis of spin-1 Ni2+ ions, which is determined by the scissor-like distortion of the NiO6
octahedra. Incommensurate magnetic order, presumably of spin-density-wave type, is observed in
the region between TN2 and TN1. Density-functional band-structure calculations put forward a
three-dimensional spin lattice with spin-1 chains running along the [01¯1] direction and stacked on a
spatially anisotropic triangular lattice in the ab plane. We show that the collinear magnetic order in
Li2NiW2O8 is incompatible with the triangular lattice geometry and thus driven by a pronounced
easy-axis single-ion anisotropy.

INTRODUCTION

Triangular-lattice antiferromagnets entail geometrical
frustration of exchange couplings and show rich physics
with a variety of ordered phases depending on temper-
ature and applied magnetic ﬁeld [1, 2]. Magnetic order
on the regular triangular lattice with isotropic (Heisen-
berg) exchange couplings is non-collinear 120◦ type even
in the quantum case of spin- 1
2 [3–7]. In real materials,
non-zero interplane couplings stabilize this order at ﬁnite
temperatures up to the N´eel temperature TN [8]. How-
ever, exchange anisotropy, which is also inherent to real
materials, will often render the magnetic behavior far
more complex.

In

triangular

antiferromagnets with

easy-axis
the 120◦ state is often preceded by a
anisotropy,
collinear state stabilized by thermal ﬂuctuations [9, 10].
Zero-ﬁeld measurements will then show two transitions
with the collinear state formed below TN1 and the 120◦
state formed below TN2 < TN1. This physics has been
well documented experimentally in CsNiCl3 [11, 12],
RbMnI3 [13, 14], and other triangular antiferromagnets.
On the other hand, the collinear phase is unstable in

systems with easy-plane anisotropy [15]. Such systems
will typically show only one magnetic transition in zero
ﬁeld, with the paramagnetic phase transforming directly
into the 120◦-ordered state below TN.

Recently, Li2NiW2O8 (Fig. 1) was reported as a
triangular-like antiferromagnet showing two subsequent
magnetic transitions at TN1 (cid:39) 18 K and TN2 (cid:39) 12.5 K in
zero ﬁeld [16, 17]. Below TN2, collinear and commensu-
rate antiferromagnetic order was reported [16], in con-
trast to other triangular antiferromagnets [11–14]. The
nature of the intermediate magnetic state between TN1
and TN2 and the origin of the collinear order below TN2
remain largely unclear.

In the following, we report an independent study
of Li2NiW2O8 including thermodynamic properties, nu-
clear magnetic resonance, and neutron scattering, as well
as a microscopic magnetic model obtained from density-
functional (DFT) band-structure calculations. We re-
vise the model of the collinear magnetic structure that
is formed below TN2 and elucidate its origin by eval-
uating both isotropic exchange couplings and single-
ion anisotropy. Our data reveal a consistent easy-axis
anisotropy scenario that is veriﬁed experimentally and
rationalized microscopically. We further demonstrate in-
commensurate nature of the magnetic order in the tem-
perature range between TN2 and TN1, and discuss its pos-
sible origin. We also probe spin dynamics in both com-

ﬁelds H = 1.5109 T and 0.906 T or by sweeping the
magnetic ﬁeld at the corresponding ﬁxed frequencies of
24.79 MHz and 15 MHz. 7Li spin-lattice relaxation rate
1/T1 was measured using a conventional saturation pulse
sequence. Spin-spin relaxation rate 1/T2 was carried out
using a standard π/2-τ -π pulse sequence.

Neutron diﬀraction data were collected on the DMC
diﬀractometer at SINQ (PSI, Villigen) operating at the
wavelength of 2.45 ˚A. Data analysis was performed using
the JANA2006 software [21].

Exchange couplings in Li2NiW2O8 were obtained from
density-functional band-structure calculations performed
in the FPLO code [22] using the experimental crystal struc-
ture and local-density approximation (LDA) exchange-
correlation potential [23]. Correlation eﬀects in the Ni 3d
shell were taken into account on the mean-ﬁeld level us-
ing the LSDA+U approach with the fully-localized-limit
double-counting correction scheme, on-site Coulomb re-
pulsion Ud = 8 eV, and Hund’s exchange Jd = 1 eV [24].
Magnetic susceptibility of the spin-1 chain was ob-
tained from quantum Monte-Carlo simulations per-
formed in the looper algorithm [25] of the ALPS simu-
lation package [26]. A ﬁnite lattice with L = 32 sites and
periodic boundary conditions was used.

III. RESULTS

A. Crystallography

Initial parameters for the structure reﬁnement were
taken from Ref. 27.
Figure 2 shows the room-
temperature x-ray diﬀraction pattern of the polycrys-
talline Li2NiW2O8 sample along with the reﬁnement.
The obtained best ﬁt parameters listed in Table I are
in close agreement with the previous report [27].

The crystal structure of Li2NiW2O8 (Fig. 1) features
NiO6 octahedra connected via WO6 octahedra. The
NiO6 octahedra are weakly distorted with two longer
Ni–O distances of 2.132 ˚A and four shorter distances of
2.04 − 2.07 ˚A. The WO6 octahedra are distorted as well
and feature one short W–O distance of 1.77 ˚A, as typical
for W6+. Triclinic symmetry of the crystal structure re-
sults in a large number of nonequivalent superexchange
pathways. Three shortest Ni–Ni distances are found in
the ab plane forming a triangular lattice, although no
pronounced two-dimensionality can be expected on crys-
tallographic grounds, because the shortest Ni–Ni distance
along c is only slightly longer than those in the ab plane,
5.81 ˚A vs. 5.60 − 5.64 ˚A (see also Table II). In fact, the
spin lattice of Li2NiW2O8 turns out to be even more
complex. While it preserves triangular features in the
ab plane, the leading exchange coupling is out of plane
and oblique to the triangular layers (Fig. 1, right). De-
tails of magnetic interactions in Li2NiW2O8 are further
discussed in Sec. III F.

II. METHODS

Polycrystalline sample of Li2NiW2O8 was prepared
by the conventional solid-state reaction technique us-
ing Li2CO3 (Aldich, 99.999%), NiO (Aldich, 99.999%),
and WO3 (Aldich, 99.999%) as starting materials. Sto-
ichiometric mixtures of the reactants were ground and
ﬁred at 600◦C for 24 hours to allow decarbonation and
then at 650◦C for 48 hours with one intermediate grind-
ing. Phase purity of the sample was conﬁrmed by pow-
der x-ray diﬀraction (XRD) experiment (PANalytical,
Empyrean) with Cu Kα radiation (λav = 1.5406 ˚A). The
data were reﬁned using FullProf [19].

Magnetization (M ) and magnetic susceptibility (χ =
M/H) data were collected as a function of temperature
(T ) and magnetic ﬁeld (H) using a SQUID magnetometer
(Quantum Design, MPMS). Heat capacity (Cp) measure-
ment was performed as a function of T and H on a sin-
tered pellet using the relaxation technique in the PPMS
(Quantum Design). High-ﬁeld magnetization data up to
60 T were collected using a pulsed magnet installed at
the Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory. Details of
the experimental procedure can be found elsewhere [20].
Our high ﬁeld data were scaled with the magnetization
data measured using SQUID magnetometer up to 7 T.

Temperature dependent nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) experiments were carried out using pulsed NMR
technique on the 7Li nucleus which has a nuclear
spin I = 3
¯γN = γN/2π =
16.546 MHz/T. Spectra were obtained either by Fourier

B. Magnetization

Temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility χ(T )
data for Li2NiW2O8 measured as a function of tempera-
ture at diﬀerent applied ﬁelds are shown in Fig. 3(a). It
increases with decreasing temperature in a Curie-Weiss
manner and shows a peak around TN1 ∼ 18 K and a
change in slope at TN2 ∼ 12.5 K, suggesting that there
are two magnetic transitions at low temperatures. These
two transitions are more pronounced in the dχ/dT vs. T
plot [Inset of Fig. 3(a)]. No broad maximum associated
with magnetic short-range ordering was observed above
TN1.

and Van-Vleck paramagnetism (χVV) of the open shells

is the Curie-Weiss (CW) law with the Curie-Weiss tem-
perature (θCW) and Curie constant C = NAµ2

where NA is Avogadro’s number, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, and µeﬀ is the eﬀective moment. The ex-
pression for the eﬀective moment is given by µeﬀ =

g(cid:112)S(S + 1)µB where g is the Land´e g-factor and S is the

spin quantum number. Our ﬁt to the 1 T data [Fig. 3(b)]
in the high temperature regime (175 K to 380 K) yields
χ0 (cid:39) −8.738 × 10−6 cm3/mol, C (cid:39) 1.24 cm3 K mol−1,
and θCW (cid:39) 20 K. The positive value of θCW suggests
that the dominant interactions are antiferomagnetic in
nature. The value of C yields an eﬀective moment

They exhibit two features: i) a change in the slope around
HSF (cid:39) 9 T, and ii) saturation around Hs (cid:39) 48 T. The
former feature is reminiscent of a spin-ﬂop transition.
Field derivative of the magnetization does not reveal any
additional features in the region between 9 T and 48 T.
We note, however, that narrow magnetization plateau,
which are not unexpected in triangular antiferromag-
nets [2], may be smeared out by thermal ﬂuctuations
and anisotropy. Therefore, measurements at lower tem-
peratures and on a single crystal are desirable to detect
possible ﬁeld-induced states in Li2NiW2O8.

C. Heat capacity

Heat capacity Cp as a function of temperature mea-
sured at zero ﬁeld is presented in Fig. 6(a). At high tem-
peratures, Cp is completely dominated by the contribu-
tion of phonon excitations. At low temperatures, it shows

factor g (cid:39) 2.23, typical for Ni2+ ion [28]. Adding core
diamagnetic susceptibilities for individual ions (χLi+ =
−0.6 × 10−6 cm3/mol, χNi2+ = −12 × 10−6 cm3/mol,
χW6+ = −13 × 10−6 cm3/mol, and χO2− = −12 ×
10−6 cm3/mol [29]), the total χcore was calculated to be
−1.35 × 10−4 cm3/mol. The Van Vleck contribution for
Li2NiW2O8 was thus estimated by subtracting χcore from
χ0 producing χVV ∼ 12.6 × 10−5 cm3/mol.

Magnetization as a function of the applied ﬁeld mea-
sured up to 7 T in static ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 4. A non-
linear behavior observed at 2 K may be due to a small
paramagnetic impurity contribution that is saturated al-
ready in low ﬁeld. In order to detect this eﬀect we have
plotted dM/dH vs. H in the inset of Fig. 4. It shows a
weak anomaly at H (cid:39) 0.5 T. With increasing tempera-
ture, the M vs. H curves become linear.

The pulse-ﬁeld magnetization data are shown in Fig. 5.

In order to estimate the phonon part of the heat ca-

cn are the integer coeﬃcients indicating the contributions
of diﬀerent atoms (or group of atoms) to Cp(T ). A sim-
ilar procedure has been adopted in various other com-
pounds to estimate the phonon contribution [30]. Fig-
ure 6(a) shows the ﬁt of Cp(T ) by Eq. (2) with c1 = 10,
c2 = 1, and c3 = 2, where c1 represents the total num-
ber of light atoms (Li and O), and c2 and c3 are the
number of Ni and W atoms, respectively. The individ-
ual cn’s sum up to 13, the number of atoms per formula
unit. Our obtained Debye temperatures are θD1 (cid:39) 820 K,
θD2 (cid:39) 440 K, and θD3 (cid:39) 236 K, thus varying inversely
with the atomic mass, as expected in a solid [31]. Fi-
nally, the high-T ﬁt was extrapolated down to 2.1 K
and Cmag(T ) was estimated by subtracting Cph(T ) from
Cp(T ) [see Fig. 6(a)].

In order to check the reliability of the ﬁtting procedure,
we calculated the total magnetic entropy (Smag) by inte-
grating Cmag(T )/T between 2.1 K and high-temperatures

To gain more information about the magnetic ordering,
we measured Cp(T ) in diﬀerent applied magnetic ﬁelds
[see Fig. 6(b)]. With increasing H from 0 T to 13 T, both
TN1 and TN2 shifted towards lower temperatures suggest-
ing an antiferromagnetic nature for both transitions. In
addition to this, the intensities of the peaks are also de-
creasing with increasing H, which is likely due to the
redistribution of magnetic entropy towards high temper-
atures. Below TN2, Cp(T ) follows a T 3 behavior down to
5 K, as shown in the inset of Fig. 6(b). In the case of an
insulator, a T 3 behavior is expected in the AFM ordered
state according to the spin wave model [32, 33].

7Li Fourier transform spectra measured at an applied

along with the central line corresponding to three allowed
transitions from 7Li NMR. As shown in Fig. 7, 7Li NMR
spectrum consists of a narrow single spectral line without
any satellites, which is likely due to the low quadruple fre-
quency or distribution of intensity of the satellites over a
broad frequency range. This single spectral line without
satellites is typically observed in several low-dimensional
oxides from 7Li NMR [34, 35]. No shift in central peak
position from the ¯γN H0 value was observed as a function
of temperature, indicating that the transferred hyperﬁne
coupling between 7Li nuclei and Ni2+ spins is very weak,
similar to that observed for Li2CuW2O8 [36].

Figure 7 shows the 7Li NMR spectra measured at
diﬀerent temperatures. The spectrum at 150 K is nar-
row and with decreasing temperature, the spectra were
found to broaden anisotropically. This anisotropic spec-
tral shape is possibly originating from the anisotropy in
χ(T ) and/or asymmetry in the hyperﬁne coupling. Fig-
ure 8 shows temperature dependence of the full width at
half maximum (FWHM) or ∆ν of NMR spectra above
TN1. ∆ν increases with decreasing temperature in a
Curie-Wiess manner. This kind of Curie-like behavior of
the NMR line width has been reported in several other
compounds [37–39]. Above TN1, the NMR line width
scales nicely with the magnetic susceptibility. In the in-
set of Fig. 8, ∆ν is plotted against magnetic suscepti-
bility with temperature as an implicit parameter. The
linear relationship between ∆ν and χ(T ) suggests that
the NMR line width follows the magnetic susceptibility

of the sample.

In a powder sample, there are various sources of NMR
line broadening. In Li2NiW2O8, since the transferred hy-
perﬁne coupling between the 7Li nuclei and neighboring
Ni2+ ions is negligible, the contributions from anisotropy
in χ(T ) and defects in the magnetic sites are almost
negligible. Therefore, we assume that the NMR spec-
tral width in Li2NiW2O8 originates from two main in-
teractions: (i) the dipolar interaction between the Li nu-
clei, and (ii) the dipolar hyperﬁne interaction of the nu-
clei (7Li) with the neighboring magnetic ions Ni2+ [36].
Therefore, one can write ∆ν above TN as [40, 41]:

∆ν = ∆ν0 + (∆ν)aniso,

(4)

where ∆ν0 is the contribution from the 7Li–7Li nu-
clear dipolar interaction, which is temperature- and ﬁeld-
independent. The second term ∆νaniso is the powder av-
erage over the anisotropic dipolar hyperﬁne interaction
between the 7Li nuclei and magnetic Ni2+ ions. This
anisotropic interaction in a polycrystalline sample gives
rise to inhomogeneous line broadening under magnetic
ﬁeld, which can be expressed in terms of static suscepti-
bility as:

∆ν0 (cid:39) 14.61 kHz and Az (cid:39) 6.7×1022 cm−3. This value of
Az corresponds to the dipolar ﬁeld generated by nuclei
at a distance r (cid:39) 2.5 ˚A apart, which is of the correct
order of magnitude for the average distance between the
Li nuclei and Ni2+ ions in Li2NiW2O8.

7Li spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1

The decay of the longitudinal magnetization after a
saturation pulse was ﬁtted well by a single exponential
function:

M0

= Ae−t/T1 + C,

(7)

where M (t) is the nuclear magnetization at a time t after
the saturation pulse, and M0 is the equilibrium value of
the magnetization. At low temperatures (T ≤ 10 K), the
recovery curve deviates from single exponential behavior

where T1L and T1S represent the long and the short

nent 1/T1L of the double exponential ﬁt matches with
the 1/T1 of the single exponential ﬁt around 10 K and
are plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 9(a).
At high temperatures (T ≥ 40 K), 1/T1 is almost
temperature-independent, as expected in the paramag-
netic regime [42]. With decrease in temperature, 1/T1
increases slowly and shows a sharp peak at TN1 (cid:39) 17.6 K
and another weak anomaly at TN2 (cid:39) 12.5 K associated
with the two magnetic phase transitions. These re-
sults are consistent with our thermodynamic measure-
ments. Below TN2, 1/T1 decreases smoothly and be-
comes temperature-independent below 9 K. This type
of temperature-independent 1/T1 behavior in the or-
dered state is rather unusual but has been observed
in the decorated Shastry-Sutherland lattice compound
CdCu2(BO3)2 [43].

√

We also measured 1/T1 at two diﬀerent temperatures,
15 K and 22 K, for diﬀerent applied ﬁelds in order to check
the eﬀect of spin diﬀusion. It is known that in Heisenberg
magnets spin correlation function exhibits a diﬀusive ef-
fect for small wave vector (q ∼ 0) [44].
In quasi-one-
dimensional (1D) and quasi-two-dimensional (2D) spin
systems, spin diﬀusion leads to a ﬁeld dependence of
1/T1 ∝ 1/
H and log(1/H), respectively [45]. Heisen-
berg spin-chain compounds [(CH3)4N]MnCl3 [46, 47],
AgVP2S6 [48], and CuCl2 · 2NC5H5 [49] are reported
to show ﬁeld dependence of 1/T1 ∝ 1/
H. On the
other hand, a log(1/H) dependence of 1/T1 has been
observed in the quasi-2D Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Zn2VO(PO4)2 [50]. As shown in the inset of Fig. 9(b),
1/T1 for Li2NiW2O8 at T = 15 K and 22 K are almost
independent of the applied ﬁeld suggesting the absence
of diﬀusive dynamics, similar to our earlier observations
for Li2CuW2O8 [36].

7Li spin-spin relaxation rate 1/T2

The temperature dependence of the spin-spin relax-
ation rate 1/T2 was measured at 14.88 MHz. The decay
of transverse magnetization after a π/2 − τ − π pulse se-
quence as a function of the pulse separation time τ was
ﬁtted by an exponential function

Mxy = M0e−2τ /T2 + C.

(9)

As shown in Fig. 10, 1/T2 is largely T -independent at
elevated temperatures in the paramagnetic state (T ≥
25 K). With decreasing temperature, 1/T2 increases sud-
denly and shows two sharp peaks at TN1 (cid:39) 17.6 K and

7Li NMR spectra below TN

Figure 11 shows temperature dependence of ﬁeld-sweep
7Li NMR spectra measured at 24.79 MHz in the low-
temperature regime. As discussed before, the NMR
line broadens systematically with decreasing tempera-
ture. Below TN1, 7Li NMR spectra were found to broaden
abruptly due to internal ﬁeld in the ordered state and
take nearly a triangular shape. The actual spectrum
looks like a superposition of a broad background and
a narrow central line at the zero shift position. Upon
lowering the temperature, this line broadening increases
and the intensity of the central line decreases. Below
the second transition TN2 (cid:39) 12.5 K, the line broadening
is drastic and attains a nearly rectangular shape with
the center of gravity at 1.512 T, which is the resonance
ﬁeld for the 7Li nuclei.
In order to reconﬁrm the line
shape, we remeasured the spectra at a lower frequency
of 14.88 MHz. Interestingly, the width and shape of the
NMR spectra were found to be identical with the spectra
measured at 24.79 MHz.

E. Neutron diﬀraction

Representative neutron powder diﬀraction patterns of
Li2NiW2O8 are shown in Fig. 12. Above TN1, only nu-
clear scattering is observed.
It is consistent with the
triclinic crystal structure reported in the literature [27].
Upon cooling below TN1, several weak magnetic reﬂec-
tions appear. Below TN2, these reﬂections abruptly dis-
appear, and new magnetic reﬂections are observed at dif-
ferent angular positions. Data collected with a tempera-
ture step of 0.5 K in the vicinity of TN2 (not shown) do
not reveal coexistence of the two magnetically ordered

from Li2NiW2O8 at diﬀerent temperatures. The lower pat-
tern shows nuclear scattering at 20 K. The upper pattern
(1.5 K) corresponds to the commensurate phase below TN2.
Magnetic reﬂections are marked with asterisks. The sequence
of patterns collected between 13 and 16 K illustrates tempera-
ture evolution of the incommensurate phase (TN2 < T < TN1),
with dashed lines tracking positions of individual magnetic re-
ﬂections. Note that the patterns are oﬀset for clarity.

phases, thus conﬁrming a second-order nature for this
transition.

2 , 0, 1

Below TN2, all magnetic reﬂections can be indexed
with the commensurate propagation vector k = ( 1
2 ).
Therefore, we ﬁnd an AFM structure with antiparallel
spins along a and c and parallel spins along b (Fig. 13).
At 1.5 K, individual components of the magnetic mo-
ments are: µa = 1.50(13) µB, µb = −0.18(9) µB, and
µc = −0.85(11) µB. The ensuing ordered moment µ (cid:39)
1.8(1) µB is slightly below 2.0 µB expected for a spin-1
ion and follows the direction of the Ni2+ easy axis (see
Sec. III F). Upon heating from 1.5 K to TN2, the ordered
moment remains nearly constant [µ = 1.7(1) µB at 12 K],
in agreement with temperature dependence of the inter-
nal ﬁeld probed by NMR (Fig. 15).

A similar magnetic structure has been reported by
Karna et al. [16], although with a very diﬀerent direc-
tion of the magnetic moment. They found µa (cid:39) µc and
µb = 0, while in our case µa and µc have opposite signs.
Our reﬁnement is based on ﬁve well-resolved magnetic
reﬂections, yet only two individual reﬂections could be

resolved in Ref. 16. Moreover, the spin direction found
in our work is compatible with the magnetic easy axis of
Ni2+ in Li2NiW2O8, while the one from Ref. 16 is not
(see Sec. III F).

In the temperature range between TN1 and TN2, only
three magnetic reﬂections are observed (Fig. 12). Two of
these reﬂections are temperature-independent, whereas
the third one shifts to lower angles upon heating. This
complex evolution of the magnetic reﬂections indicates
that more than one propagation vector may be re-
quired to describe the intermediate-temperature phase
in Li2NiW2O8, and, unfortunately, no reliable solution
of the magnetic structure could be found based on pow-
der data. Importantly, though, none of the three reﬂec-
tions can be indexed with a commensurate propagation

Isotropic exchange couplings

The relatively simple crystal structures of Li2M W2O8
(M = Cu, Ni, and Co) [27] host remarkably complex
magnetic interactions. Recently, we reported a very intri-
cate and strongly frustrated three-dimensional spin lat-
tice of Li2CuW2O8 [51], where magnetic interactions up
to the Cu–Cu distance of 9.3 ˚A play crucial role. The spin
lattice of the Ni compound is less perplexing, but also
unusual. Individual magnetic interactions are obtained
from LSDA+U calculations [52] as energy diﬀerences be-
tween collinear spin states [53]. The resulting exchange
couplings Ji parametrize the spin Hamiltonian:

(cid:88)

(cid:104)ij(cid:105)

ˆH =

JijSiSj −(cid:88)

i

AS2

iκ,

(10)

where the summation is over lattice bonds (cid:104)ij(cid:105), and the
local spin is S = 1. The second term denotes single-ion
anisotropy A that will be discussed later in this section.
Exchange couplings are labeled using crystallographic di-
rections, where we take advantage of the fact that there
is only one Ni atom per unit cell.

The Ji’s listed in the last column of Table II are ob-
tained from LSDA+U calculations. We ﬁnd that all lead-
ing interactions in Li2NiW2O8 are AFM. Additional mi-
croscopic insight into the origin of these couplings can be
obtained from LDA band structure, where correlation ef-
fects are largely neglected. This metallic band structure
(Fig. 14) features well-deﬁned Ni 3d bands that are split
into t2g and eg complexes by the octahedral crystal ﬁeld.
The Fermi level bisects the half-ﬁlled eg states. Their
tight-binding description yields hopping parameters tαβ
,
where αβ = x2 − y2, 3z2 − r2 are magnetic orbitals of
Ni2+. These hopping parameters listed in Table II un-
derlie the AFM superexchange Ji in Li2NiW2O8.

i

The analysis of hopping parameters provides direct
comparison to Li2CuW2O8 [51] with its spin- 1
2 Cu2+ ions
featuring x2 − y2 as the only magnetic orbital. In both
Cu and Ni compounds, same couplings J100, J010, and
J110 are active in the ab plane, whereas J¯110 correspond-
ing to the longer Ni–Ni distance is negligible [54]. On
the other hand, the couplings between the ab planes are
remarkably diﬀerent. Li2CuW2O8 reveals the leading in-
terplane coupling J011 along with the somewhat weaker
J11¯1 and J¯101. In contrast, Li2NiW2O8 features J0¯11 that
is triggered by the hopping between the 3z2 − r2 orbitals
and thus endemic to the Ni compound. The direct cou-
pling along the c axis (J001) as well as other interplane
couplings beyond J0¯11 are much weaker than the three

leading couplings in the ab plane. Therefore, Li2NiW2O8
lacks extraordinarily long-range couplings that are inte-
gral to the spin lattice of Li2CuW2O8 [51].

The spin lattice of Li2NiW2O8 is quasi-1D. It entails
the leading coupling J01¯1 forming spin chains, and three
weaker couplings forming triangular loops in the ab plane
(Fig. 1). Therefore, this compound can be viewed as a
system of spin-1 chains stacked on the triangular lattice,
similar to, e.g., CsNiCl3 [11, 12]. The coupling geometry
is in line with previous results, and the absolute values of
Ji are rather similar to those reported in Ref. 17, while
exchange couplings in Ref. 16 are roughly 4 times larger.
A closely related exchange topology has been reported for
Li2CoW2O8 as well [55]. On the other hand, Li2CuW2O8
is very diﬀerent [51]. It shows a 1D feature in the ab plane
along with an intricate network of frustrated exchange
couplings in all three dimensions.

2. Comparison to the experiment

Our computed exchange couplings compare well to the
experimental data. The Curie-Weiss temperature is a

where zi = 2 is the number of couplings per site. We
obtain θCW = 23.6 K that compares well to the experi-
mental θCW (cid:39) 20 K.

The saturation ﬁeld corresponds to the energy diﬀer-
ence between the ground-state spin conﬁguration and the
ferromagnetic state. Using the classical energy of the
k = ( 1

2 ) AFM state, we ﬁnd:

2 , 0, 1

Hs = 2S(2J100 +2J110 +2J01¯1)kB/(gµB) = 46.6 T, (12)

2 , 0, 1

which is again in good agreement with the experimen-
tal Hs (cid:39) 48 T. We further note that the hierarchy of
exchange couplings in Table II is compatible with the
k = ( 1
2 ) order observed below TN2. The AFM cou-
pling J100 imposes AFM order along the a direction.
On the other hand, the AFM diagonal coupling J110
is stronger than J010. Therefore, the magnetic order is
AFM along [110] and thus FM along [010]. Likewise, the
AFM coupling J0¯11 combined with the FM order along b
2 , 0, 1
results in the AFM order along c, and the k = ( 1
2 )
state ensues.

The quantitative description of thermodynamic prop-
erties can be extended by ﬁtting temperature dependence
of the magnetic susceptibility (Fig. 3). To this end, we
ﬁrst consider the model of an isolated spin-1 chain that
describes the experimental data down to 30 K resulting
in J1D (cid:39) 14.1 K and g = 2.23. Unfortunately, the sus-
ceptibility of the full 3D model can not be simulated us-
ing quantum Monte Carlo because of the sign problem.
Therefore, we resort to the high-temperature series ex-
pansion (HTSE) [56]. To reduce the number of variable
parameters, we ﬁxed the ratios of J100, J010, and J110.
The ﬁt describes the data down to 20 K, i.e., nearly down
to TN1, arriving at J01¯1 (cid:39) 13.0 K, J100 (cid:39) 0.5 K, and
g = 2.21 in reasonable agreement with the DFT results
in Table II. Note, however, that the estimate of J100 (and
thus of all couplings in the ab plane) is rather sensitive
to the temperature range of the ﬁt and, additionally, the
eﬀect of the single-ion anisotropy can not be included in
the HTSE available so far [56].

3. Single-ion anisotropy

The single-ion anisotropy term AS2

iκ, which is typical
for Ni2+, originates from weak distortions of the NiO6 oc-
tahedron and depends on mutual positions of individual
crystal-ﬁeld levels [57]. We have ﬁrst used the xyz coor-
dinate frame, with the z axis directed along the longer
Ni–O bond (2.13 ˚A) and the x and y axes pointing along
the shorter Ni–O bonds (2.04− 2.07 ˚A). The resulting or-
bital energies listed in Table III do not follow crystal-ﬁeld
splitting anticipated for the octahedron elongated along
z. For example, one expects εxy > εyz (cid:39) εxz because

The contributions to the single-ion anisotropy Ax, Ay, and Az
(in K) are calculated using Eqs. (13), where the xy and x2−y2
orbitals have been swapped for the x(cid:48)y(cid:48)z coordinate frame.

of the shorter Ni–O distances in the xy plane, but we
ﬁnd εxy < εyz < εxz instead. This shows that not only
geometrical eﬀects but also the O–Ni–O angles deviating
from 90◦ and the covalency of Ni–O interactions aﬀect
the orbital energies.

The contributions of the spin-orbit coupling λ giving
rise to the single-ion anisotropy are determined using

where λ = 0.078 eV is the spin-orbit coupling constant
for Ni2+ [58]. The terms Aγ enter the spin Hamiltonian
γ, such that the largest Aγ deter-
mines the preferred spin direction. Our estimates for the
xyz coordinate frame show that the z direction is least
favorable, and the y direction is most favorable, but no
well-deﬁned easy-plane or easy-axis scenario is obtained.
A more natural model can be derived for the modiﬁed
x(cid:48)y(cid:48)z coordinate frame, where we turn the x and y axes
by 45◦, so that they bisect Ni–O bonds in the xy plane.
This way, the xy and x2 − y2 orbitals are swapped. The
x(cid:48)y(cid:48) orbital is half-ﬁlled and x(cid:48)2 − y(cid:48)2 is fully ﬁlled (note
that these two orbitals should be swapped in Eqs. (13)
too). We then obtain Ax(cid:48) > Ay(cid:48) (cid:39) Az (Table III) and
identify x(cid:48) as the easy axis.
The eﬀective anisotropy term in the spin Hamiltonian
Eq. (10) is obtained as A = Ax(cid:48) − Ay(cid:48) (cid:39) 9 K, and
κ = x(cid:48) = [0.852,−0.023,−0.503] is the direction bisect-
ing the two shorter Ni–O bonds of the elongated NiO6
octahedron. Remarkably, this direction matches the ex-
perimental spin direction [0.89(9),−0.10(5),−0.49(6)] in
the magnetically ordered state. Moreover, our micro-
scopic estimate A (cid:39) 9 K is compatible with the spin-
ﬂop ﬁeld HSF (cid:39) 9 T (Fig. 5). Note however that HSF
also depends on the anisotropy of the g-tensor, which
is presently unknown and should be addressed in future
studies.

11

Our data reveal collinear and commensurate magnetic
order in Li2NiW2O8 already below TN2. In powder sam-
ples, the direction of the internal ﬁeld is randomly dis-
tributed with respect to that of the applied ﬁeld H.
Therefore, one can express the NMR spectrum f (H)
as [62, 63]:

f (H) ∝ H 2 − H 2

n + H 2
0

HnH 2

,

(14)

where H0 = ω/¯γN = |H + Hn| is the central ﬁeld, ω is
the NMR frequency, ¯γN is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio,
and Hn is the internal ﬁeld. Two cutoﬀ ﬁelds, H0 + Hn
and H0 − Hn, produce two sharp edges of the spectrum.
In real materials, these sharp edges are usually smeared
by the inhomogeneous distribution of the internal ﬁeld.
In order to take this eﬀect into account, we convoluted
f (H) with a Gaussian distribution function g(H):

F (H) =

f (H − H(cid:48))g(H(cid:48))dH(cid:48),

The spectra below TN2 are well ﬁtted by Eq. (15), as
shown in Fig. 11. This conﬁrms the commensurate na-
ture of the ordered state below TN2 (cid:39) 12.5 K.

Above TN2, the magnetic order changes drastically.
The NMR spectra have a nearly triangular shape in
this temperature range. Their maximum is at ¯γNH0,
as shown in Fig. 11,
similar to that reported for
Cu3B2O6 [64], (DIETSe)2GaCl4 [65], and Cr1−xTxB2 (T
= Mo and V) [66]. This triangular-like shape of the NMR
spectra is a typical powder pattern of an incommensurate
spin-density-wave (SDW) state [67].

In an incommensurately ordered state, the powder
NMR spectral shape function f (x) can be written as [67]:

point to the transition points.

Our results also elucidate the origin of the single-ion
anisotropy in Li2NiW2O8. The Ax(cid:48) > Ay(cid:48) (cid:39) Az relation
can be traced back to the εy(cid:48)z > εx(cid:48)z (cid:39) εx(cid:48)2−y(cid:48)2 rela-
tion of orbital energies that, in turn, reﬂects a peculiar
geometrical distortion of the NiO6 octahedron. The y(cid:48)
axis bisects the smaller O1–Ni–O2’ angle of 86.45◦ com-
pared to the O1–Ni–O2 angle of 93.55◦ bisected by the x(cid:48)
axis. This diﬀerence between the O–Ni–O angles results
in a lower energy of the x(cid:48)z orbital, and thus puts the
magnetic easy axis along x(cid:48). Remarkably, the scissor-
like distortion of the NiO6 octahedron turns out to be
more important than the diﬀerence between the Ni–O
distances (elongation of the octahedron along z). A sim-
ilar scenario has been recently reported for a Ti3+ com-
pound, where a scissor-like distortion of the octahedron
stabilizes an unusual orbital ground state [59].

IV. DISCUSSION

A. Ordered states

Li2NiW2O8 reveals two successive magnetic transi-
tions with two distinct magnetically ordered states. At
ﬁrst glance, this splitting of the magnetic transition is
reminiscent of triangular antiferromagnets with easy-axis
anisotropy. Similar behavior has been reported for sys-
tems like CsNiCl3 [11, 12] and CsMnI3 [13, 14], where a
non-collinear (120◦-type) magnetic structure below TN2
is followed by a collinear state above TN2. Both states
have the same commensurate propagation vector. More
recently, a split magnetic transition in zero ﬁeld was ob-
served in Ba3CoNb2O9 [60, 61] and Li2CoW2O8 [55], all
having triangular features of the spin lattice, but no di-
rect probe of the magnetically ordered state(s) of these
compounds with neutron scattering or NMR has been
reported to date.

where x = (H − ω/¯γN)/(Hn)max, −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, (Hn)max
is the maximum amplitude of the internal ﬁeld, and si-
nusoidal modulation is assumed. As shown in Fig. 11,
the experimental spectrum at T = 17.5 K is well ﬁtted
by Eq. (17), thus corroborating incommensurate mag-
netic order between TN1 and TN2 inferred from neutron
diﬀraction.

Temperature dependence of the internal ﬁeld Hn ex-
tracted from the NMR spectra is presented in Fig. 15.
The internal ﬁeld increases rapidly below about 18 K and
then develops the tendency of saturation towards low
temperatures. Below 12.5 K, Hn shows another sharp in-
crease and then saturates below 5 K, thus reﬂecting the
two magnetic transitions.

not disappear completely even at 4.3 K. This kind of co-
existence of the high-T phase (central line) with low-T
ordered phase (broad background) has been observed in
several other compounds [33]. This coexistence could be
due to two reasons: a spread of transition temperatures
within the polycrystalline sample, and the presence of
crystal defects/local dislocations in the sample. In the
case of a distribution of TN, one would observe a broad
peak in 1/T1 and 1/T2. Clearly, our experimentally ob-
served sharp peaks in 1/T1 and 1/T2 at both TN1 and TN2
rule out this possibility. As discussed above, a triangular
shape of the powder NMR spectrum is also expected in an
incommensurate ordered state. Our simulation indeed re-
produces the experimental spectrum very well suggesting
that the triangular shape below TN1 is intrinsic in nature.
Moreover, the persistence of a tiny central peak at 4.3 K
could be due to small amount of defects and dislocations
which is of course unavoidable in powder samples.

The magnetic transitions in Li2NiW2O8 should be jux-
taposed with those in CsNiCl3. Microscopically, both
compounds can be viewed as quasi-1D, with spin chains
stacked on the triangular lattice. In CsNiCl3, the leading
intrachain coupling manifests itself in characteristic ex-
citations at higher energies [68–70], whereas long-range
magnetic order is essentially determined by the frustrated
couplings in the ab plane. The reduced magnetic moment
in the ordered state (1.0 µB [71]) is taken as a hallmark
of quantum ﬂuctuations triggered by the 1D nature of
the spin lattice [72]. In Li2NiW2O8, the ordered moment
of 1.8 µB approaches the full moment of 2 µB for a spin-1
ion, thus indicating proximity to the 3D regime and mi-
nor role of quantum ﬂuctuations. Indeed, the ratio of the
intrachain to interchain couplings (J01¯1/ ¯Jab) is as low as
3.8 in Li2NiW2O8 compared to nearly 60 in CsNiCl3 [69].
CsNiCl3 adopts a 120◦-like magnetic order below TN2
followed by a collinear order between TN2 and TN1 with
the same, commensurate propagation vector. In contrast,
magnetic order in Li2NiW2O8 is collinear already below
TN2. Antiparallel spin arrangement along [100] and [110],
as opposed to the parallel spin arrangement along [010],
can be ascribed to the hierarchy of competing exchange
couplings J100 > J110 > J010, but collinear state itself is
in fact not expected for the isotropic (Heisenberg) spin
Hamiltonian on the triangular lattice, at least for the
parameter regime derived in our work.

Using exchange couplings from Table II, we performed
classical energy minimization and arrived at a spiral
ground state with k = (0.382, 0.266, 1
2 + ky), where the
incommensurability along the c direction is due to the
diagonal nature of the interplane coupling J01¯1. This
discrepancy between the classical spiral state and the
collinear state observed experimentally has been reported
for Li2CuW2O8 as well [51]. Quantum ﬂuctuations are
a natural mechanism for stabilizing the collinear state,
but the large ordered moment in Li2NiW2O8 renders this
possibility unlikely. On the other hand, the single-ion
anisotropy A (cid:39) 9 K favors the collinear state and over-

comes the eﬀect of frustration. It is worth noting that
this mechanism is not operative in the Cu compound,
where single-ion anisotropy vanishes for a spin- 1
The single-ion anisotropy is comparable to the lead-
ing exchange coupling, A/J01¯1 (cid:39) 0.91 in Li2NiW2O8,
while in CsNiCl3 this ratio is 0.04 only [69]. The pro-
nounced anisotropy combined with the frustration on the
triangular lattice may also be responsible for the for-
mation of the incommensurate order between TN2 and
TN1. The competition between the commensurate and
incommensurate states is reminiscent of Ca3Co2O6 that
shows a peculiar sequence of magnetization plateaus in
applied magnetic ﬁeld [73–75]. Ca3Co2O6 has been con-
sidered as a prototype material for spin chains stacked
on the triangular lattice, although the actual geome-
try of its interchain couplings is more complex [76]. A
striking feature of Ca3Co2O6 is its incommensurate spin-
density-wave state [77, 78] that is metastable and gradu-
ally transforms into commensurate magnetic order with
time [79]. Li2NiW2O8 also shows an incommensurate-
commensurate transformation, although both phases are
thermodynamically stable and can be reversibly trans-
formed upon heating or cooling.
Importantly, though,
Ca3Co2O6 features ferromagnetic spin chains with a very
strong single-ion anisotropy (A/J (cid:29) 1) [80–82], while in
Li2NiW2O8 the spin chains are AFM, and A/J (cid:39) 1.

B. Spin dynamics

In general, for a relaxation process driven by electron-
spin ﬂuctuations one can write 1/T1 in terms of the dy-
namic susceptibility χM ((cid:126)q, ω0) as [35, 42]:

where the sum is over wave vectors (cid:126)q within the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone, A((cid:126)q) is the form factor of the hyperﬁne
interactions, and χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
M ((cid:126)q, ω0) is the imaginary part of the
dynamic susceptibility at the nuclear Larmor frequency
ω0. For q = 0 and ω0 = 0, the real component of
χ(cid:48)
M ((cid:126)q, ω0) corresponds to the uniform static susceptibil-
ity χ.
In the paramagnetic regime, 1/χT1T should be
temperature-independent.
As shown in Fig. 9(b), 1/χT1T is indeed almost
temperature-independent above 30 K. For T ≤ 30 K,
it increases slowly and shows a sharp increase below
20 K. This increase in 1/χT1T implies the dominance of
χ(cid:48)(cid:48)
M ((cid:126)q, ω0) over χ(0, 0), which is due to the growth of an-
tiferromagnetic correlations with q (cid:54)= 0 from the ordered
state.

In the high-temperature paramagnetic limit, when the
thermal energy is much larger than the exchange energy,
the 1/T1 of an antiferromagnet becomes temperature-
independent and can be expressed as [42]:

pected to diverge and the fast electron spin ﬂuctuations
are slowed down. The value of γ represents the univer-
sality class of the system that depends on the dimension-
ality and symmetry of the spin lattice, and on the type of
magnetic interactions. According to the theoretical pre-
dictions, the γ value is close to 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.5 for 3D
Heisenberg, 3D Ising, 2D Heisenberg, and 2D Ising an-
tiferromagnets, respectively [86]. Our 1/T1 is ﬁtted well
by a power law for τ ≤ 0.3 giving γ (cid:39) 0.60 − 0.75. This
would be consistent with either 3D Ising or 2D Heisen-
berg cases, and the former option looks plausible, given
the easy-axis anisotropy present in Li2NiW2O8 and the
3D nature of the magnetic order formed below TN1.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Li2NiW2O8 reveals two successive magnetic transitions
at TN1 (cid:39) 18 K and TN2 (cid:39) 12.5 K indicating two distinct
magnetically ordered phases. Using nuclear magnetic
resonance and neutron scattering, we have shown that
the low-temperature phase is commensurate, with the
propagation vector k = ( 1
2 ), while the intermediate-
temperature phase is incommensurate, and its NMR sig-
nal resembles that of a spin-density wave. Collinear na-
ture of the low-temperature phase is driven by the sizable
single-ion anisotropy A (cid:39) 9 K that is comparable to the
leading exchange coupling J01¯1 (cid:39) 9.9 K.

2 , 0, 1

The magnetic model of Li2NiW2O8 can be represented
by spin-1 chains stacked on the triangular lattice in the
ab plane. Despite quasi-1D nature of the spin lattice with
J01¯1/ ¯Jab (cid:39) 3.8, the magnetic response of Li2NiW2O8 is
largely three-dimensional. We do not ﬁnd broad maxi-
mum in the magnetic susceptibility above TN1, and the
ordered magnetic moment µ = 1.8(1) µB at 1.5 K is close
to 2 µB expected for a spin-1 ion.

The NMR line width analysis suggests the dipolar na-
ture of the coupling between Li nuclei and magnetic Ni2+
ions. 1/T1 below TN2 follows a T 5 behavior, indicating
that the relaxation is mainly governed by three-magnon
processes. Analysis of 1/T1 in the critical regime, just
above TN1 suggests that the 3D ordering at TN1 is driven
by the easy-axis anisotropy.

is the num-
ber of nearest-neighbor Ni2+ spins for a given Li site.
Information about the superexchange constant can be
achieved from the analysis of 1/T1 using the above ex-
pression. The value of Az (cid:39) 6.7× 1022 cm−3 corresponds
to 0.94 kOe/µB [83]. Using the appropriate parameters,
Az (cid:39) 0.94 kOe/µB, γN = 103.962 × 106 rad s−1 T−1,
z = 2, z(cid:48) = 2, g = 2.23 [obtained from the χ(T ) analy-
sis], S = 1, and the high-temperature (150 K) relaxation
(cid:39) 206.6 s−1 for the Li site, the mag-
rate of
nitude of the maximum exchange coupling constant is
calculated to be Jmax/kB (cid:39) 9 K. This value is in excel-
lent agreement with the leading exchange coupling J0¯11
obtained from DFT calculations (Table II).

In the magnetically ordered state (T < TN), the strong
temperature dependence of 1/T1 is a clear signature of
the relaxation due to scattering of magnons by the nu-
clear spins [84]. For T (cid:29) ∆/kB, 1/T1 follows either a T 3
behavior or a T 5 behavior due to a two-magnon Raman
process or a three-magnon process, respectively, where
∆ is the energy gap in the spin-wave spectrum [33, 85].
On the other hand, for T (cid:28) ∆/kB, it follows an acti-
vated behavior 1/T1 ∝ T 2e−∆/kBT . As shown in the in-
set of Fig. 9(a), 1/T1 for Li2NiW2O8 below TN2 follows a
T 5 behavior rather than a T 3 behavior, which ascertains
that the relaxation is mainly governed by three-magnon
process similar to that reported for spin- 1
2 square-lattice
compound Zn2VO(PO4)2 [50], three-dimensional frus-
trated antiferromagnet Li2CuW2O8 [36], and decorated
Shastry-Sutherland compound CdCu2(BO3)2 [43].

In order to analyze the critical behavior close to TN1,
we have plotted 1/T1 versus the reduced temperature τ
= (T − TN1)/TN1 above TN1 in Fig. 16. Usually in the
critical regime (i.e., in the vicinity of TN) one would ex-
pect a critical divergence of 1/T1 following the power law
1/T1 ∝ τ−γ, where γ is the critical exponent. When
approaching TN from above, the correlation length is ex-
