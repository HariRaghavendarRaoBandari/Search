QUASI-CYCLIC SUBCODES OF CYCLIC CODES

JEAN-CLAUDE BELFIORE, CEM G ¨UNER˙I1, AND BUKET ¨OZKAYA

Abstract. We completely characterize possible indices of quasi-cyclic subcodes in a cyclic code
for a very broad class of cyclic codes. We present enumeration results for quasi-cyclic subcodes of a
ﬁxed index and show that the problem of enumeration is equivalent to enumeration of certain vector
subspaces in ﬁnite ﬁelds. In particular, we present enumeration results for quasi-cyclic subcodes of
the simplex code and duals of certain BCH codes. Our results are based on the trace representation
of cyclic codes.

1. Introduction

Let Fq denote the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements, where q is a prime power, and let m and ℓ be
positive integers. A linear code C ⊆ Fmℓ
is called a quasi-cyclic (QC) code of index ℓ if it is invariant
under shift of codewords by ℓ units and ℓ is the minimal number with this property. Clearly QC
codes are generalizations of cyclic codes, for which ℓ = 1. QC codes drew much attention in the
literature since they yield codes with good parameters (see for instance [3, 4]). The class of QC
codes and some of its subclasses also perform well asymptotically and reach the Gilbert-Varshamov
bound ([5, 8, 9, 10]).

q

Studying subcodes in well-known classes of codes is a common theme in coding theory for various
purposes. Our motivation to study QC subcodes in cyclic codes stems from [7], where the number
of rational points of supersingular curves is related to weight analysis of certain subcodes of cyclic
codes. It is shown in [7] that these subcodes are QC codes.

We consider cyclic codes of length qn − 1 over Fq and assume throughout that the dual code’s
zeros all have q-cyclotomic cosets of length n over the base ﬁeld Fq (cf. Section 2). Note that this is
true for a broad class of cyclic codes. We have two particular problems addressed: to determine all
possible indices of QC subcodes in a given cyclic code and to count the number of QC subcodes for
a ﬁxed index. We solve the ﬁrst problem completely and list all positive integers that are indices
of some QC subcode (Theorem 2.6). In particular, we observe that not every divisor of the cyclic
code’s length need to be the index of some QC subcode (Remark 2.9). For the second problem,
we show that the enumeration of QC subcodes in a cyclic code is related to the count of vector
subspaces in ﬁnite ﬁelds. For the class of cyclic codes we study, we show that these two problems
are equivalent (cf. Theorem 3.1). Using this observation, we can count QC subcodes of a given
index in certain well-known cyclic codes. Enumeration results require counting subspaces in Fqn
which are deﬁned over a subﬁeld Fqd in a maximal way (i.e. these spaces do not have a vector space

structure over a subﬁeld that contains Fqd). We give exact count of such vector spaces in Theorem
3.3, using inclusion-exclusion principle. We utilize the trace representation of cyclic codes ([11]) to
obtain our results.

Organization of the paper is as follows: We determine possible indices of QC subcodes in a given
cyclic code in Section 2. Enumeration of QC subcodes is addressed in Section 3, where the relation
to counting vector subspaces in a ﬁnite ﬁeld is given. In Section 4, we enumerate QC subcodes
of the q-ary simplex code of length qn − 1 for any prime power q and any n. Section 5 contains
enumeration results for QC subcodes of duals certain BCH codes. Proofs of our enumeration results
yield an algorithm that counts indices and their appearances (multiplicities) for certain cyclic codes.
Section 6 consists of some examples produced by the algorithm. Magma code of the algorithm is
made available on-line for interested readers ([1]).

2. Indices of QC Subcodes

Let n and N be positive integers with N = qn − 1 and let α a primitive N th root of unity.
Throughout this work, we will concentrate on the cyclic code C over Fq of length N with basic
dual zeros

BZ(C ⊥) = {αi1, . . . , αis},

where ij ≥ 1 for all j and ij’s come from pairwise distinct q-cyclotomic cosets mod N . This means
that the generating polynomial of C ⊥ is the product of the minimal polynomials of αij ’s over Fq.
Since N and q are relatively prime these minimal polynomials are distinct. Moreover, we will
assume throughout that the q-cyclotomic coset mod N for each ij has size n. Note
that this amounts to saying that the minimal polynomials of αij ’s over Fq are all of degree n; or
equivalently Fqn = Fq(αij ) for each j.

Trace representation of C is as follows ([11, Proposition 2.1]):

C =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrFqn /Fq(cid:16)λ1αki1 + · · · + λsαkis(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤N −1

; λj ∈ Fqn, 1 ≤ j ≤ s(cid:27) .

Coordinates of length N codewords of C are obtained by evaluating the trace expression for each
0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1.

Consider a subcode of C,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

C ′ =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrFqn /Fq(cid:16)β1αki1 + · · · + βsαkis(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤N −1

; βj ∈ Vj ⊆ Fqn, 1 ≤ j ≤ s(cid:27) .

The following result will play a crucial role in this article.

Theorem 2.1. [6, Theorem 2.5] Let ij ≥ 1 be positive integers (for 1 ≤ j ≤ s) which are in
diﬀerent q-cyclotomic cosets mod N = qn − 1. For λ1, . . . , λs ∈ Fqn, we have

TrFqn /Fq(cid:0)λ1xi1 + · · · + λsxis(cid:1) = 0,

for all x ∈ Fqn

if and only if each ij has q-cyclotomic coset mod N of length |Cycq(ij)| = δj < n and TrFqn /F
(λj) =
0 for all j = 1, . . . , s. In particular, if each ij has q-cyclotomic coset of length n, then (2.3) holds
if and only if λj = 0 for all j.

QUASI-CYCLIC SUBCODES OF CYCLIC CODES

3

Theorem 2.1 justiﬁes our assumption on the sizes of q-cyclotomic cosets of ij’s in the trace
representation of the cyclic code C, as can be seen in the next results and in Section 3 when we
consider enumeration of QC subcodes.

Lemma 2.2. C ′ is an Fq-linear subcode if and only if Vj is an Fq-linear subspace of Fqn for all j.

Proof. Choose two arbitrary codewords from C ′:

(i.e. βj, γj ∈ Vj for all j). C ′ is an Fq-linear subcode of C if and only if for any a ∈ Fq we have

Since we assumed that every ij has q-cyclotomic coset mod N of size n, Theorem 2.1 implies that
(2.4) holds if and only if aβj + γj = ρj for all j (i.e. aβj + γj ∈ Vj for all j). The result follows. (cid:3)

We will assume from now on that Vj’s describing the subcode C ′ in (2.2) are all
q , i.e. T (u1, u2, . . . , uN ) =

Fq-subspaces of Fqn. Let T denote the cyclic shift operator on FN
(uN , u1, . . . , uN −1). The following is easy to observe.

Lemma 2.3.

For each 1 ≤ j ≤ s, let us now deﬁne the following subcode of C ′:

Next, we obtain a criterion for quasi-cyclicity of C ′
j.

Proposition 2.4. C ′
ℓj is the minimal such number.

j is an index ℓj QC code if and only if Vj is an Fq(αℓj ij )-subspace of Fqn and

4

JEAN-CLAUDE BELFIORE, CEM G ¨UNER˙I1, AND BUKET ¨OZKAYA

Proof. According to Lemma 2.3, C ′
j is closed under shift of codewords by t units if Vj is closed
under multiplication by α−tij . Since Vj is an Fq-subspace of Fqn, this is equivalent to saying that
Vj is closed under scalar multiplication by elements in

Fq[α−tij ] = Fq(α−tij ) = Fq(αtij ).

Hence, if Vj is an Fq(αℓj ij )-subspace of Fqn and ℓj is the minimal such number, then C ′
ℓj QC code.

j is an index

For the converse, suppose C ′

j is an index ℓj QC code. So, given βj ∈ Vj, there exists γj ∈ Vj

such that

(cid:16)TrFqn /Fq(cid:16)(βjα−ℓj ij )αkij(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤N −1

or equivalently

=(cid:16)TrFqn /Fq(cid:16)γjαkij(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤N −1

,

TrFqn /Fq(cid:16)(βj α−ℓjij − γj)αkij(cid:17) = 0 for all 0 ≤ k ≤ N − 1.

By assumption ij has size n q-cyclotomic coset mod N . Therefore by Theorem 2.1, the above equal-
ity holds for all k if and only if βjα−ℓj ij − γj = 0. In other words Vj is closed under multiplication
by α−ℓjij and ℓj is the minimal such positive integer. Hence the result follows.
(cid:3)

We need two more facts on ﬁnite ﬁelds. Proofs are clear, hence omitted.

Proposition 2.5. (i) Consider Fq ⊆ Fqd ⊆ Fqn and let α be a primitive element in Fqn. Then

Ld =

qn − 1
qd − 1

is the least positive integer such that αLd ∈ Fqd. Moreover, αLd is a primitive element of Fqd.

(ii) For αi ∈ Fqn, the least positive integer ℓd satisfying αiℓd ∈ Fqd is

ℓd =

lcm(i, Ld)

i

.

The following result describes the set of possible indices for QC subcodes in C.

Theorem 2.6. (i) Consider the Fq-linear subcode C ′ of the cyclic code C (cf. (2.1) and (2.2)).
For 1 ≤ j ≤ s, let Fqdj be the largest intermediate ﬁeld in Fqn/Fq such that Vj is an Fqdj -subspace
of Fqn. Let

Lj =

qn − 1
qdj − 1

and ℓj =

lcm(ij , Lj)

ij

, ∀j

and let ℓ = lcm(ℓ1, . . . , ℓs). If ℓ 6= qn − 1 = N , then C ′ is an index ℓ QC subcode of C.

(ii) Let Fqd1 , . . . , Fqdu be the intermediate ﬁelds of the extension Fqn/Fq, where d1 = 1 and

du = n. Let Lj =

qn − 1

ti 6= tj for any i 6= j} \ {qn − 1},

C has QC subcodes of index ℓ for every ℓ ∈ I and has no QC subcode of diﬀerent index.

Proof. (i) Note that if some Vj = {0}, then it can be considered “maximally” as a vector space
over Fqn. Then the index of C ′
j should be 1 since {0} is a vector space over any subﬁeld of Fqn,
and in particular over Fq(αij ) (cf. Proposition 2.4). In this case, indeed, Lj = 1 and hence ℓj = 1.
Now suppose Vj is not zero and let Fqdj be the largest ﬁeld over which it is a vector space. By
Proposition 2.5, the least power of αij that lies in Fqdj is ℓj. So, Fq(αℓj ij ) ⊆ Fqdj and hence Vj is
an Fq(αℓj ij )-space. By maximality of dj, any ﬁeld over which Vj has a vector space structure must
be contained in Fqdj . Therefore, ℓj is indeed the index of C ′
j by Proposition 2.4. It is clear that
the index of C ′ is the least common multiple of indices of all C ′

j’s.

(ii) Part (i) shows that the index of a QC subcode of C lies in I. Take an element ℓ =

t1 , . . . , ℓam

lcm(cid:0)ℓa1

deﬁned over the intermediate ﬁeld F
index of C ′
there is a QC subcode of C of that index.

tj for all j = 1, . . . , m. Hence the index of C ′ is ℓ. Therefore for any element of I,

daj (e.g. Vtj = F

q

Remark 2.7. Let us note that the exponents ij’s in the trace representation of the cyclic code C
can be any representative of a q-cyclotomic coset mod N . In other words, replacing ij by qij in
(2.1) still yields the same code. Let us observe that the choice of cyclotomic coset representatives in
C’s trace representation does not aﬀect indices of QC subcodes either. For this, let j ∈ {1, . . . , s}
and note that La is relatively prime to q for any 1 ≤ a ≤ u (with the notation of Theorem 2.6).
Then,

Remark 2.8. Let us now show that a diﬀerent primitive element choice for Fqn does not change
the set I of possible indices for QC subcodes. Let η be another primitive element in Fqn. Then
η = αr for some 1 < r < qn − 1 and gcd(r, qn − 1) = 1. Then,

for some j1, . . . , js. Note that for each t ∈ {1, . . . , s}, this means αrjt = αit . In other words,

BZ(C ⊥) = {αi1, . . . , αis} = {ηj1, . . . , ηjs},

rjt = it + kt(qn − 1), 1 ≤ t ≤ s,

for some integers k1, . . . , ks. For a ∈ {1, . . . , u}, let ν be such that

(it + kt(qn − 1)) ν = lcm (it + kt(qn − 1), La) .

Since La divides kt(qn − 1), we conclude that ν is the smallest positive integer so that itν is a
multiple of La (i.e. itν = lcm(it, La)). Hence,

lcm (it + kt(qn − 1), La)

it + kt(qn − 1)

=

(it + kt(qn − 1)) ν

Hence, contributions of it and jt to the index relative to the intermediate ﬁeld Fqda are the same.

Remark 2.9. A natural question is whether a cyclic code has an index ℓ QC subcode for every
divisor ℓ of its length. This is not necessarily the case as the following example shows. Consider
the binary cyclic code C of length 15 with the trace representation

With the notation of Theorem 2.6, we have i1 = 1, d1 = 1, d2 = 2, d3 = 4. Moreover,

C =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrF24 /F2(cid:16)λαk(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤14

; λ ∈ F24(cid:27) .

L1 = 15, L2 = 5, L3 = 1,

and

= 1.

Hence, C has only cyclic and index 5 QC subcodes but no index 3 QC subcode, which is the other
divisor of its length. An index 5 QC subcode can be easily obtained from Theorem 2.6 and here is
an example:

Note that C ′ is a rather “small” code, let us list its nonzero codewords:

C ′ =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrF24 /F2(cid:16)βαk(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤14

; β ∈ F22(cid:27) .

c1 = (0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0),

c2 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),

c3 = (0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1).

Clearly, the codewords of C ′ are invariant relative to 5-shift.

Observe that C is the binary simplex code of length 15. We will have a complete investigation

of QC subcodes of the simplex code in Section 4.

3. Enumeration of QC Subcodes

We saw in Section 2 that QC subcodes of a cyclic code C and their indices are determined by
the vector subspaces of Fqn that determine the coeﬃcients of terms in the trace representation and
the maximal intermediate ﬁelds over which they have vector space structure. Hence, enumeration
of QC subcodes of a ﬁxed index in C is clearly related to the number of vector subspaces in Fqn.
Due to trace, however, various choices of coeﬃcient vector spaces may yield the same subcode. The
following result shows that this is not the case in our setting.

We will continue considering the cyclic code C with the trace representation in (2.1). For vector

spaces V1, . . . , Vs ⊆ Fqn, let us denote the subcode determined by them as in (2.2) by CV .

Theorem 3.1. Consider the cyclic code C in (2.1) and let V = (V1, . . . , Vs) and W = (W1, . . . , Ws)
be collection of vector subspaces in Fqn that determine subcodes CV and CW as in (2.2). Then,
CV = CW if and only if Vj = Wj for all j. In particular, the number of QC subcodes of index ℓ in
C is the same as the number of vector space choices V1, . . . , Vs ⊆ Fqn that yield this index.

This holds exactly when

Since each ij has full size q-cyclotomic coset by assumption, Theorem 2.1 implies that (3.1) holds
if and only if λj = βj for all j.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.2. We can loosen the assumption on the cyclotomic cosets of ij’s and still write a
criterion for equality of subcodes CV and CW . Namely, suppose that

|Cycq(ij)| = n for 1 ≤ j ≤ r,

|Cycq(ij)| = δj < n for r + 1 ≤ j ≤ s.

Theorem 2.1 implies that CV = CW if and only if

Vj = Wj for 1 ≤ j ≤ r and TrFqn /F

(Vj) = TrFqn /F

Note that each k ∈ {1, . . . , n} counts Fq-subspaces of dimension k. In the rest of the man-
uscript, the number of subspaces will refer to this number, which excludes the zero
subspace.

The following result provides the number of nonzero vector subspaces in Fqn maximally deﬁned
over an intermediate ﬁeld of the extension Fqn/Fq. It will be used in the following sections to obtain
enumeration results for QC subcodes of certain cyclic codes. We ﬁrst introduce some notation.

then it also has a vector space structure over Fi1,...,it. Therefore we need to subtract the number of

5. QC Subcodes of Duals of BCH Codes

5.1. Dual of the binary double-error-correcting BCH code. Dual of the binary double-
error-correcting BCH code of length N = 2n − 1 is deﬁned as

C =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrF2n /F2(cid:16)λαk + βα3k(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤N −1

; λ, β ∈ F2n(cid:27) .

With the notation of Theorem 2.6, i1 = 1 and i2 = 3. Note that |Cycq(3)| = n for any q and n
except for q = 2 and n = 2. We will investigate this code for two families of n values.

5.1.1. n = ua−1: power of a prime. In order to have full cyclotomic coset for 3, we will exclude
the case u = 2 = a, in which case C is a rather short and uninteresting code.

2 values for the dual of the binary BCH code for n = ua−1

The following result describes all possible indices for QC subcodes of the dual of the binary

double-error-correcting BCH code when n = ua−1.

Proposition 5.1. For the dual of the binary double-error-correcting BCH code C of length N =
2ua−1 − 1, indices of QC subcodes are

I = {La = 1, La−1, . . . , L2}.

QUASI-CYCLIC SUBCODES OF CYCLIC CODES

Proof. By Theorem 2.6, I consists of ℓi
2)’s can produce. Of
course, L1 = N is excluded from I. By Table 1, L2, L3, . . . , La are all contained in I. We need to
check the outcomes of lcm(ℓi

It is well-known that the polynomial xut−1 − 1 (for any t) factors over Q into cyclotomic poly-

nomials:

xut−1

− 1 = (x − 1)φu(x)φu2 (x)φu3(x) · · · φut−1(x).

Therefore for any 1 ≤ i ≤ a, we have

Li =

φu(2)φu2 (2) · · · φua−1(2)
φu(2)φu2 (2) · · · φui−1(2)

= φui(2)φui+1(2) · · · φua−1(2).

Hence for i < j, we have Lj | Li and lcm(Li, Lj) = Li. Using Table 1, lcm(ℓi
do not bring any new value to I for both odd and even prime values of u.

(cid:3)

We are ready to count QC subcodes.

Theorem 5.2. Consider the dual of the binary double-error-correcting BCH code C of length

− 1 for a prime number u and an integer a ≥ 2 except for u = 2 = a. Let

Aj = N (ua−j−1, 2uj

) − N (ua−j−2, 2uj+1

) for 0 ≤ j ≤ a − 1.

(i) If u is odd, then C has 3 cyclic subcodes (including itself ),

3Aa−2 + Aa−2N (u, 2ua−2

)

QC subcodes of index La−1, and

(5.2)

2Aj−1 + Aj−1(N (ua−j , 2uj−1

) + N (ua−j−1, 2uj

))

QC subcodes of index Lj for any 2 ≤ j ≤ a − 2.

(ii) If u = 2, then C has 3 cyclic subcodes (including itself ) for any a. For a ≥ 4, there are

3Aa−2 + Aa−2N (u, 2ua−2

)

QC subcodes of index La−1,

(5.3)

2Aj−1 + Aj−1(N (ua−j , 2uj−1

) + N (ua−j−1, 2uj

))

QC subcodes of index Lj for 3 ≤ j ≤ a − 2, and

(5.4)

2A1 + A0 + A1N (ua−1, 2) + (A0 + A1)N (ua−3, 2u2

)

QC subcodes of index L2. If a = 3, there are

(5.5)

3A1 + 2A0 + A1N (u2, 2)

QC subcodes of index L2.

12

JEAN-CLAUDE BELFIORE, CEM G ¨UNER˙I1, AND BUKET ¨OZKAYA

Proof. A QC subcode of C is of the form

(5.6)

C ′ =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrF

2ua−1 /F2(cid:16)λαk + βα3k(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤N −1

; λ ∈ V, β ∈ W(cid:27) ,

where V, W ⊆ F2ua−1 are subspaces deﬁned over some intermediate ﬁeld of the extension F2ua−1 /F2.
Note that this extension’s subﬁeld structure is rather simple (cf. (5.1)). Hence it is easy to see
for
that Aj describes the number of nonzero subspaces in F2ua−1 deﬁned maximally over F2uj
0 ≤ j ≤ a − 1 (cf. (3.5) and note that Aa−1 = 1 by the convention in (3.4)).

The following observation in the proof of Proposition 5.1 will be the main tool for our analysis

below:

If i < j, then lcm(Li, Lj) = Li.

Note that in any case, subcodes of index La = 1 (i.e. cyclic subcodes) are obtained by letting
(V = F2ua−1 , W = 0), (V = 0, W = F2ua−1 ) or (V = F2ua−1 , W = F2ua−1 ) (the code C itself).
Moreover when a = 2, we have an extension F2u/F2 and C only has cyclic subcodes and there are
3 cyclic subcodes as noted above. Hence, we will assume that a ≥ 3 below.

(i) Choices of V and W that yield QC subcodes of index La−1 can be systematically listed as

follows:

V : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−2 , W = 0
V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−2 , W : deﬁned over F2ua−2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−1 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−2

The number of such choices are, respectively,

Aa−2, Aa−2, Aa−2N (u, 2ua−2

), Aa−1Aa−2,

whose sum is 3Aa−2 + Aa−2N (u, 2ua−2
). Note that for a = 3, there are only QC subcodes of index
La−1 = L2 (other than cyclic subcodes) whose count is given above and (5.2) does not apply to
this situation. For a ≥ 4 and 2 ≤ j ≤ a − 2, choices of V and W that yield QC subcodes of index
Lj are

V : maximally deﬁned over F2uj−1 , W = 0
V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over F2uj−1
V : maximally deﬁned over F2uj−1 , W : deﬁned over F2uj−1
V : maximally deﬁned over F2uj , W : maximally deﬁned over F2uj−1
V : maximally deﬁned over F2uj+1 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2uj−1

...

V : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−1 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2uj−1

The number of choices for the ﬁrst three combinations are, respectively,

Aj−1, Aj−1, Aj−1N (ua−j, 2uj−1

).

The remaining choices add up to N (ua−j−1, 2uj

)Aj−1. The total is

2Aj−1 + Aj−1(N (ua−j , 2uj−1

) + N (ua−j−1, 2uj

)).

QUASI-CYCLIC SUBCODES OF CYCLIC CODES

13

(ii) For a ≥ 5, the count of Lj for 3 ≤ j ≤ a follows as in part (i) and the results for index La−1
subcodes, (5.3) and (5.4) are identical. For a = 4, counting goes similarly again but note that (5.3)
does not apply to this situation. So, what needs special attention here is the number of index L2
QC subcodes for a ≥ 4 and a = 3. For a ≥ 4, choices of V and W that yield QC subcode of index
L2 are as follows:

V : maximally deﬁned over F2u, W = 0
V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over F2
V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over F2u
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u, W : deﬁned over F2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u2 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u2 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2u
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u3 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u3 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2u

...

V : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−1 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2ua−1 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2u

The number of choices for the ﬁrst four combinations are, respectively,

A1, A0, A1, A1N (ua−1, 2).

The remaining choices add up to (A0 + A1)N (ua−3, 2u2

). Total is the desired value.

When a = 3, choices of V and W that yield QC subcode of index L2 are as follows:

V : maximally deﬁned over F2u, W = 0
V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over F2
V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over F2u
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u, W : deﬁned over F2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u2 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2
V : maximally deﬁned over F2u2 , W : maximally deﬁned over F2u

The number of choices for the ﬁrst four combinations are, respectively,

A1, A0, A1, A1N (u2, 2).

The remaining two choices add up to (A0 + A1). Hence the total is 3A1 + 2A0 + A1N (u2, 2) and
the proof is ﬁnished.

2 values for the dual of the BCH code for n = uv

The following result describes all possible indices for QC subcodes in the case n = uv.

Proposition 5.3. For the dual of the binary double-error-correcting BCH code C of length N =
2uv − 1, indices of QC subcodes are follows:

{L2, L3, L4}
if u, v are both odd
{L2, L3, L3/3, L4} if u = 2, v 6= 3: odd
{1, 3, 7, 9, 21}

if u = 2, v = 3

I =


Proof. We use the ℓi

1 and ℓi

2 values in Table 2. Let us note that
2uv − 1 = φu(2)φv(2)φuv(2),
2u − 1 = φu(2),
2v − 1 = φv(2).

Hence, L2 = φv(2)φuv(2) and L3 = φu(2)φuv(2).

For the case u and v are both odd, other than L2, L3 and L4, the only possible index for a QC

subcode is lcm(L2, L3). However,

lcm(L2, L3) = φuv(2)lcm(2u − 1, 2v − 1) = φuv(2)(2u − 1)(2v − 1) = L1.

Hence I = {L2, L3, L4} in this case.

For u = 2, v odd and v 6= 3, note that L1/3 = L2. Therefore, other than L2, L3, L3/3 and L4,
the only other possible index for a QC subcode is lcm(L2, L3/3). Since φu(2) = 2u − 1 = 3 in this
case, we have L3/3 = φuv(2) and this is a divisor of L2. Hence lcm(L2, L3/3) = L2 and there is no
new contribution to I in this case.

When u = 2 and v = 3, it is easy to verify the set I is as stated in the proposition.

(cid:3)

We are ready to count QC subcodes of the dual of the BCH code in the case n = uv.

Theorem 5.4. Consider the dual of the binary double-error-correcting BCH code C of length
N = 2uv − 1, where u and v are distinct prime numbers. Then C has 3 cyclic subcodes (including
itself ) for any u and v. Moreover:

QUASI-CYCLIC SUBCODES OF CYCLIC CODES

15

(i) If u and v are odd, then C has (2N (v, 2u) + N (v, 2u)2 − 3) QC subcodes of index L2 and

(2N (u, 2v) + N (u, 2v)2 − 3) QC subcodes of index L3.

(ii) If u = 2 and v 6= 3 and odd, then C has (N (uv, 2)+N (v, 2u)+N (uv, 2)N (v, 2u)−2N (u, 2v)−
1) QC subcodes of index L2, (N (u, 2v)2−1) QC subcodes of index L3 and (2N (u, 2v)−2) QC subcodes
of index L3/3.

(iii) If u = 2 and v = 3, then C has 124194 QC subcodes of index 21, 99 QC subcodes of index

9, 84 QC subcodes of index 7 and 18 QC subcodes of index 3.

Proof. Note that the number of subspaces in Fuv
that are maximally deﬁned over F2, F2u and F2v
2
are respectively given by (N (uv, 2) − N (u, 2v) − N (v, 2u) + 1), (N (v, 2u) − 1) and (N (u, 2v) − 1).
Consider a subcode C ′ as in (5.6) of C. We will use Table 2 and the combination of lcm(ℓi
2)’s
that lead to the corresponding index. For all possibilities of u and v, it is clear that there are
3 cyclic subcodes of C obtained by the choices (V = F2uv , W = 0), (V = 0, W = F2uv ) and
(V = F2uv , W = F2uv ).

If u and v are both odd, then the choices of subspaces V, W that yield the indices L2, L3 are as

follows:

V : maximally deﬁned over F2uv , W : maximally deﬁned over F2u

Total number of such subspaces is

(N (v, 2u) − 1) + (N (v, 2u) − 1) + (N (v, 2u) − 1)N (v, 2u) + (N (v, 2u) − 1) = 2N (v, 2u) + N (v, 2u)2 − 3.

V : maximally deﬁned over F2uv , W : maximally deﬁned over F2v

Total number of such subspaces is

2N (u, 2v) + N (u, 2v)2 − 3.

If u = 2 and v 6= 3, the choices of subspaces V, W that yield the indices L2, L3, L3/3 are alisted
below. Note that L1/3 = L2 when u = 2. Moreover, lcm(L2, L3/3) = L2 (cf. proof of Proposition
5.1).

= 1 + pu + p2u + · · · + p(v−1)u = φv(p)φuv(p)

= 1 + pv + p2v + · · · + p(u−1)v = φu(p)φuv(p)

Note that any positive power of p is congruent to 1 mod 2. Therefore L2 ≡ v and L3 ≡ u mod 2.
This implies that when u and v are both odd primes, no Li is divisible by 2. If u = 2 and v is an
odd prime, then L1 and L3 are divisible by 2, L2 is not. Combining these observations, values of
1 and ℓj

2 are presented in Table 3. Note that when u = 2, L1/2 and L3/2 are not equal to Li for
any 1 ≤ i ≤ 4 regardless of choice of the odd primes p and v.

2 values for the dual of the p-ary BCH code for n = uv

The following result describes all possible indices for QC subcodes in this case.

Proposition 5.5. For the dual of the p-ary BCH code C of length N = puv − 1 and designed
distance 3, indices of QC subcodes are follows:

I =( {L1, L2, L3, L4}

{L1, L1/2, L2, L3, L3/2, L4} if u = 2, v: odd

if u, v are both odd

Proof. By Table 3, all index values in the statement belong to I. Again, we need to check that
lcm(ℓi
2) values do not bring any diﬀerent index to I. One of the key observations for this purpose
is the following:

1, ℓj

lcm(φu(p), φv(p)) = φu(p)φv(p) =

(pu − 1)(pv − 1)

(p − 1)2

.

18

Therefore lcm(L2, L3) = L1 in any case. Moreover, it is clear that Li | L1 for i = 2, 3, 4. Therefore
the result follows immediately for the case u and v are both odd.

For u = 2, v: odd case, the following extra least common multiple values, compared to previous

case, can be easily veriﬁed:

lcm(L1, L1/2) = L1
lcm(L1, L3/2) = L1
lcm(L2, L3/2) = L1/2 lcm(L3, L1/2) = L1

lcm(L2, L1/2) = L1/2
lcm(L3, L3/2) = L3

Therefore the result also follows in the second case.

(cid:3)

We count the QC subcodes in the following result.

Theorem 5.6. Consider the dual of the p-ary BCH code C of length N = puv − 1, where u and
v are distinct prime numbers. Let A = N (uv, p) − N (u, pv) − N (v, pu) + 1. Then C has 3 cyclic
subcodes (including itself ) for any u and v. Moreover:

(i) If u and v are odd, then C has

A + A(cid:0)N (uv, p) + N (u, pv) + N (v, pu)(cid:1) + 2(cid:0)N (u, pv)N (v, pu) − N (u, pv) − N (v, pu) + 1(cid:1)

QC subcodes of index L1,

QC subcodes of index L2, and

2N (v, pu) + N (v, pu)2 − 3

2N (u, pv) + N (u, pv)2 − 3

QC subcodes of index L3.

(ii) If u = 2 and v an odd prime, C has

A + AN (uv, p) + (N (u, pv) − 1)(A + N (v, pu) − 1)

QC subcodes of index L1,

QC subcodes of index L1/2,

QC subcodes of index L2,

QC subcodes of index L3 and

QC subcodes of index L3/2.

2A + (N (v, pu) − 1)(A + N (u, pv) − 1)

2N (v, pu) + N (v, pu)2 − 3

N (u, pv)2 − 1

2(N (u, pv) − 1)

Proof. Let us note that the number of subspaces in Fuv
that are maximally deﬁned over Fp, Fpu
p
and Fpv are given by A, (N (v, pu) − 1) and (N (u, pv) − 1), respectively. Consider a subcode C ′ of
C.

C ′ =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrFpn /Fp(cid:16)λαk + βα2k(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤N −1

; λ ∈ V, β ∈ W(cid:27) .

QUASI-CYCLIC SUBCODES OF CYCLIC CODES

19

We will proceed as in the proof of Theorem 5.4 and use Table 3 and the combination of lcm(ℓi
2)’s
that lead to the corresponding index (cf. proof of Proposition 5.5). For all possibilities of u and v,
it is clear that there are 3 cyclic subcodes of C.

1, ℓj

If u and v are both odd, then the choices of subspaces V, W that yield index L1 are as follows:

L1 : V : maximally deﬁned over Fp, W = 0
V = 0 W : maximally deﬁned over Fp
V : maximally deﬁned over Fp, W : deﬁned over Fp
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fp
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpv
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpv , W : maximally deﬁned over Fp
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpv , W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv, W : maximally deﬁned over Fp

Total number of such subspaces is

2A + AN (uv, p) + (N (v, pu) − 1)(A + N (u, pv) − 1) + (N (u, pv) − 1)(A + N (v, pu) − 1) + A,

which yields the desired result. For index L2, we have

L2 : V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W = 0
V = 0 W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu

Total number of such subspaces is

2(N (v, pu) − 1) + (N (v, pu) − 1)N (v, pu) + (N (v, pu) − 1) = 2N (v, pu) + N (v, pu)2 − 3.

The result for index L3 follows identically.

When u = 2 and v an odd prime, the choices of V, W yielding index L1 are as follows:

L1 : V : maximally deﬁned over Fp, W = 0

V : maximally deﬁned over Fp, W : deﬁned over Fp
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpv , W : maximally deﬁned over Fp
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpv , W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu

Total number of such subspaces is

A + AN (uv, p) + (N (u, pv) − 1)(A + N (v, pu) − 1).

For the other indices, we have the following:

L1/2 : V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over Fp

V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fp
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpv
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv, W : maximally deﬁned over Fp

20

JEAN-CLAUDE BELFIORE, CEM G ¨UNER˙I1, AND BUKET ¨OZKAYA

Total number of such subspaces is

A + (N (v, pu) − 1)(A + N (u, pv) − 1) + A.

L2 : V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W = 0
V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpu, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpu

Total number of such subspaces is

2(N (v, pu) − 1) + (N (v, pu) − 1)N (v, pu) + (N (v, pu) − 1).

L3 : V : maximally deﬁned over Fpv, W = 0

V : maximally deﬁned over Fpv, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpv
V : maximally deﬁned over Fpv, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv

Total number of such subspaces is

2(N (u, pv) − 1) + (N (u, pv) − 1)2.

L3/2 : V = 0, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpv

V : maximally deﬁned over Fpuv, W : maximally deﬁned over Fpv

Total number of such subspaces is 2(N (u, pv) − 1).

6. Examples

Our results in Sections 2 and 3 yield an algorithm, which can compute possible indices of QC
subcodes of a given cyclic code based on Theorem 2.6, together with the number of these subcodes
by using Theorems 3.1 and 3.3.
In [1], we provide a Magma code ([2]), which illustrates the
algorithm for length qn − 1 cyclic codes of the form

C =(cid:26)(cid:16)TrFqn /Fq(cid:16)λ1αki1 + λ2αki2 + λ3αki3(cid:17)(cid:17)0≤k≤qn−2

; λj ∈ Fqn, 1 ≤ j ≤ 3(cid:27) ,

where

n = ua1

3 , such that ai ≥ 1, ui : distinct primes for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3.

1 ua2

2 ua3

In the following examples, we used the code in [1] for some binary (q = 2) and ternary (q =
3) cyclic codes satisfying the conditions above. Namely, Table 4 presents the indices and the
appearances of QC subcodes of binary simplex codes (i1 = 1, i2 = i3 = 0), dual of the double-error-
correcting BCH codes (i1 = 1, i2 = 3, i3 = 0) and dual of the triple-error-correcting BCH codes
(i1 = 1, i2 = 3, i3 = 5), for various n values. The results are listed in the form [i, Mi], where Mi is
the number of proper nonzero QC subcodes of index i. In particular, for i = 1 the corresponding
count M1 is the number of proper nonzero cyclic subcodes. Table 5 presents the similar results
for ternary simplex codes (i1 = 1, i2 = i3 = 0), dual of the BCH codes of designed distance 3
(i1 = 1, i2 = 2, i3 = 0) and dual of the BCH codes of designed distance 5 (i1 = 1, i2 = 2, i3 = 4).
Note that we do not consider prime n values, since no proper QC subcode occurs in this case. We
do not consider cases where q-cyclotomic coset mod qn − 1 for some ij has size less than n.
