Several approximate equalities among the matrix elements of CKM and PMNS imply that hidden symmetries
may exist and be common for both quark and neutrino sectors. The CP phase of the CKM matrix (δCKM) is
involved in these equalities and can be investigated when these equalities turn into several equations. As we
substitute those experimentally measured values of the three mixing angles into the equations for quarks, it is
noted that one of the equations which holds exactly has a solution δCKM = 68.95◦. That value accords with
(69.1+2.02
−3.85)◦ determined from available data. Generalizing the scenario to the lepton sector, the same equality
determines the leptonic CP phase δPMNS to be 276.10◦. Thus we predict the value of δPMNS from the equation.
So far there is no direct measurement on δPMNS yet, but a recent analysis based on the neutrino oscillation data
prefers the phase close to 270◦.

INTRODUCTION

Following recognition of quark mixing and determining the
non-zero CP phase in the quark sector, with longtime accumu-
lation of data on solar[1–3], atmosphere[4, 5], accelerator[6–
8] and reactor neutrino experiments[9, 10], the mixing among
diﬀerent neutrino ﬂavors is conﬁrmed.
In fact theoretical
physicists[11, 12] proposed the possibility of neutrino mix-
ing ﬁfty years ago to interpret the solar neutrino beam deﬁcit.
Since the lepton ﬂavor eigenstates do not match with the mass
eigenstates a unitary transformation matrix i.e. Pontecorvo-
Maki-Nakawaga-Sakata (PMNS) matrix was introduced to
bridge them. The 3 × 3 matrix possesses three mixing angles
and a CP phase which may also be non-zero. From then on, to
determine the mixing parameters and CP phase composes the
most important task for both experimentalists and theorists of
this ﬁeld. Even though through hard work the three mixing
angles have been determined with a certain accuracy, the lep-
tonic CP phase is still not clear. Along with the experimental
search for the CP pase, one might expect to predict it from the
theory aspect.

In our early works[13, 14] several approximate equalities
among the matrix elements of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
(CKM)[15, 16] were found based on investigating relations
among diﬀerent parametrization schemes of the mixing ma-
trix (CKM and PMNS). The equalities may be induced by a
hidden symmetry. It is noted that those equalities also hold
for the lepton sector, even though the present data on neu-
trinos are not as accurate as for the quark sector. Obviously
those equalities may help to reduce the number of free param-
eters of the matices, i.e. the degree of freedom is reduced due
to existence of the hidden symmetry. For that we regard these
equalities to several equations. Supposing these equations to
be exact, by inputting several CKM matrix elements[17, 18]
into the equations, other elements are obtained, and it is found
that the results well coincide with the available data within the

error tolerance range. In the three-generation fermion frame-
work, there are only four free parameters in the 3 × 3 mixing
matrix i.e. the three mixing angles and one CP phase, thus we
expect that due to a hidden symmetry one or more parameters
could be determined by the other parameters via the equations.
In this work, we are able to determine the CP phase of CKM
from the equations and then generalize this scenario to the lep-
ton sector. Meanwhile, we would testify which equality holds
more precisely or in other words, to judge their approximation
degrees. The results help us to conclude whether the hidden
symmetry is complete or somehow slightly broken. In this
letter we will use simpliﬁed forms of these equations which
were given in our earlier works and investigate the values of
the leptonic CP phase by these equations.

II. EQUALITIES AMONG THE MATRIX ELEMENTS AND

THE CP PHASE

Mixing among diﬀerent ﬂavors of quarks (neutrinos) via
the CKM (PMNS) matrix has been ﬁrmly recognized. The
Lagrangian of the weak interaction reads

L =

g
√2

¯ULγµVCKMDLW +

µ

g

¯ELγµVPMNSNLW−µ

+ h.c.,(1)

where UL = (uL, cL, tL)T , DL = (dL, sL, bL)T , EL =
(eL, µL, τL)T and NL = (ν1, ν2, ν3)T . VCKM and VPMNS are the
CKM and PMNS matrices respectively. The 3× 3 mixing ma-
trix V is written as

V =

.

Generally, for a 3 × 3 unitary matrix there are four in-
dependent parameters, namely three mixing angles and one
CP phase. There can be various schemes to parameterize
the matrix which are summarized in Ref.[19]. The standard

parametrization is shown as[17]

V =

Here s jk and c jk denote sin θ jk and cos θ jk with j, k = 1, 2, 3.

and PMNS respectively.

.

In our previous work [13, 14] deﬁnite relations among the
values of sin δi where δi’s are the CP phase in the nine diﬀer-
ent parametrization schemes were found, then we turned these
relations into several approximate equalities among the matrix
elements of CKM (or PMNS) as

where |V jk| ( j, k = 1, 2, 3) are the modules of the correspond-
ing matrix elements. In Ref.[13] using the central values of
the measured |V jk|[17] all the equalities Eq.(4) through Eq.(8)
were checked and it is noted that they all hold with certain
accuracies for both CKM and PMNS matrices.

These equalities can be then rewritten as

1 − |V33|2 ≈ 0,

1 − |V23|2 − |V11||V12|
|V21||V22|

where normalization conditions such as |V13|2 +|V23|2 +|V33|2 =
1 were used. We employ Eqs. (4) and (7) respectively to sim-
plify Eqs. (11) and (13) to achieve more succinct forms. Ap-
parently Eqs. (9) and (13) display relations among the ma-
trix elements of the two adjacent rows and Eqs.
(11) and
(12) demonstrate relations among the matrix elements of the
two adjacent columns. Eq. (10) corresponds to the relations
among the six matrix elements |V11|, |V12|, |V21|, |V23|, |V32| and
|V33|. These equalities reveal existence of some underlying
symmetries which determine them.
Now let us suppose the matrix elements to be variables,
then these equalities would turn into several equations by
which one may expect to gain solutions. In this letter we will
further investigate the CP phases of CKM and PMNS in terms
of the corresponding equations. Since there are abundant data
on the hadron decays, the parameters in the CKM matrix are
well determined. One can use these values to judge which
equality holds with higher precision.

Using the expressions of matrix elements in Eq. (3), Eqs.
(9)-(13) are transformed into the forms directly related to
the three mixing angles and CP phase.
If one inputs the
values of three mixing angles he can study the dependence
of the left sides of Eqs.
(9)-(13) on the CP phase. For
quark sector the dependence is depicted in Fig. 1(a)-(e) with
θ12 = 13.023◦, θ23 = 2.360◦, θ13 = 0.201◦[19]. From those
diagrams, one ﬁnds:

1. All the left sides of the ﬁve equations vary within very

small ranges for diﬀerent δCKM values.

2. At the two sultions the ﬁrst three equations hold exactly.

We list the corresponding values in Table I.

3. The last two equations do not possess solutions which
are reasonable, namely the values of the left sides of the equa-
tions are close to 0 when δCKM = 0◦ or 360◦ that obviously
contradict to the suggested data.

4. The left side of Eq. (10) is sensitive to the change of

δCKM.

5. The solution 68.95◦ obtained from Eq. (10) is accordant
with the data (69.1+2.02
−3.85)◦[19] within the error tolerance i.e. the
equality oﬀers proper information on the hadronic CP phase
for the quark sector.

Apparently Eq.

(10) holds with the highest accuracy
whereas Eqs. (9) and (11) are not so precise, but the approxi-
mation degree is still appreciable, then for expressions of (12)
and (13) equality is almost totally lost to a not-allowed degree.
Thus it means that the equality degree of Eq. (9) through Eq.
(13) could be diﬀerent as the underlying symmetry is broken,
therefore not all of them can be applied to determine the CP

phase by inputting the mixing angles. We decide that Eq.(10)
would be the best choice.

So far there is no direct measurement on the leptonic CP
phase yet, naturally one may expect to gain information on it
from future experiments. It is known that δPMNS can induce
CP violation eﬀects in neutrino oscillation experiments. Bet-
ter than nothing, at present, indirect analyses[20, 21] based
on the neutrino experiments suggest that the leptonic CP
phase δPMNS is close to 270◦. Since the Eq.
(10) predicts
a more precise value of δCKM, we have all reason to expect
that it is eligible to be applied for determining δPMNS.
In
analog to the quark case as inputting the central values of
θ12 = 33.71◦, θ23 = 41.38◦, θ13 = 8.80◦ (for normal ordering
of neutrino masses) one can ﬁx δPMNS = 83.90◦ or 276.10◦
as Eq. (10) is supposed to hold exactly. For inverted order-
ing of neutrino masses the central value of θ13 is 8.91◦ and
then the predicted value of δPMNS would change only slightly.
Apparently the theoretical prediction δPMNS ∼ 276.10◦ is con-
sistent with the results given in Ref. [20, 21]. If the result
is conﬁrmed by the future measurements one would ﬁnd that
the sum of δCKM and δPMNS is close to 360◦ i.e. δCKM adopts
the left side value of Fig. 1(b) whereas δPMNS takes the right
side value (f). The mutual complementarity between δPMNS
and δCKM may impose a constrant condition to exclude the so-
lution of 83.90◦. From Tab. I one can note that the solutions
obtained from Eqs. (9) and (11) are also close to 270◦, even
though in the quark sector the CP phase determined by their
counterpart equations apparently deviates from data.

III. SUMMARY

In our previous paper several approximate equalities among
the elements of CKM (PMNS) were derived.
In this letter
we try to simplify them and those simple and succinct rela-
tions imply existence of hidden symmetries in both the quark
and neutrino sectors even though they may be approximate or
slightly broken. Using the equations we investigate the CP
phase of CKM and PMNS matrices. Supposing these equa-
tions hold exactly, as the three mixing angles of quarks are in-
puts one only obtains an accurate δCKM from Eq. (10) whereas
the others equations fail to provide precise information about
the CP phase, even though the solutions of Eq. (9) and Eq.
(11) are still plausibly close to the data. By solving Eq. (10)
with inputting the the measured values of the neutrino mixing
angles we obtain the leptonic CP phase δPMNS to be 83.90◦ or
276.10◦. Since at present there is no direct experimental mea-
surement on δPMNS of PMNS yet, we need to determine which
value of the two would be that chosen by the nature. The mu-
tual complementarity between quark and lepton sectors help
to pin it down. Moreover, indirect analyses made by experi-
mentalists indicate that the phase is close to 270◦. Thus the
solution δPMNS = 276.10◦ is consistent with the recent analy-
ses on neutrino experiment.

It is well known that the 3 × 3 unitary matrix for fermion
mixing can have three mixing angles and one CP phase. Gen-
erally, except the unitary requirement, it seems that there are
no other constraints on them, so the four parameters are in-

dependent. Namely, one cannot derive any of them from the
other three. However, our analysis clearly shows that from
the equations which were derived in our earlier works the CP
phase can be obtained from the three mixing angles whose
values are experimentally measured. It implies that there is
a hidden symmetry which may associate the four parame-
ters together. Even though we do not know what the hidden
symmetry is, we notice its existence. The hidden symmetry
determines those equalities which we discovered from phe-
nomenology. Therefore, precise data of the three mixing an-
gles would determine the CP phase except there exist a δ and
2π − δ degeneracy. That is the common sense. Moreover,
the association between quark and lepton sectors is exposed
and this generalization of those equalities from quark sector
to leptonic one is by no means trivial. In particular, we use
the same equality which holds for both quarks and leptons to
obtain the CP phase as 276.10◦ or 83.90◦ for neutrinos which
has not well been experimentally measured yet but is some-
how determined by the oscillation data, and our theoretical

4

prediction is consistent with this value. In this sense, the de-
generacy of δ and π−2δ is lifted by the mutual complementar-
ity between quark and lepton sectors as δPMNS = 270◦ being
uniquely ﬁxed. In this work we only expose this fact from
the phenomenological aspect, but it is still mysterious if all
the equalities indeed originate from a hidden symmetry. If so,
does the phenomenon that some of the equalities are only ap-
proximately holding, mean breaking of the symmetry or there
exists a mechanism which causes deviation from exact hold-
ing? The profound source is worth of further exploration.
