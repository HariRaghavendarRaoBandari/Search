REMOVAL OF PHASE TRANSITION OF THE CHEBYSHEV

QUADRATIC AND THERMODYNAMICS OF H ´ENON-LIKE MAPS

NEAR THE FIRST BIFURCATION

HIROKI TAKAHASI

Abstract. We treat a problem at the interface of dynamical systems and equilibrium sta-
tistical physics. It is well-known that the geometric pressure function

t ∈ R 7→ sup

µ (cid:26)hµ(T2) − tZ log |dT2(x)|dµ(x)(cid:27)

of the Chebyshev quadratic map T2(x) = 1 − 2x2 (x ∈ R) is not diﬀerentiable at t = −1.
We show that this phase transition can be “removed”, by an arbitrarily small singular per-
turbation of the map T2 into H´enon-like diﬀeomorphisms. A proof of this result relies on an
elaboration of the well-known inducing techniques adapted to H´enon-like dynamics near the
ﬁrst bifurcation.

1. Introduction

The thermodynamic formalism, i.e., the formalism of equilibrium statistical physics de-
veloped by G. W. Gibbs and others, has been successfully brought into the ergodic theory
of chaotic dynamical systems (see e.g., [3, 16] and the references therein).
In the classical
setting, it deals with a continuous map f of a compact metric space X and a continuous
function ϕ on X, and looks for equilibrium measures which maximize (the minus of) the free

energy Fϕ(µ) = hµ(f ) +R ϕdµ among all f -invariant Borel probability measures on X. A
relevant problem is to study the regularity of the pressure function t ∈ R 7→ P (tϕ), where
P (tϕ) = supµ Ftϕ(µ).
The existence and uniqueness of equilibrium measures depends upon details of the system
and the potential. For transitive uniformly hyperbolic systems and H¨older continuous poten-
tials, the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium measures as well as the analyticity of the
pressure function has been established in the pioneering works of Bowen, Ruelle and Sinai
[3, 16, 19]. The latter property is interpreted as the lack of phase transition.

One important problem in dynamics is to understand structurally unstable, or nonhyper-
bolic systems [15]. The main problem which equilibrium statistical physics tries to clarify is
that of phase transitions [16]. Hence, it is natural to study how phase transitions are aﬀected
by small perturbations of dynamics.

A natural candidate for a potential is the so-called geometric potential ϕ(x) = − log kDf|Eu
xk,
where Eu
x denotes the unstable direction at x which reﬂect the chaotic behavior of f . For non-
hyperbolic systems, x 7→ Eu
x is often merely measurable, and may even be unbounded as in
the case of one-dimensional maps with critical points. These defects sometimes lead to the

occurrence of phase transitions, e.g., the loss of analyticity or diﬀerentiability of the pressure
function. Typically, at phase transitions, there exist multiple equilibrium measures.

As an emblematic example, consider the family of quadratic maps Ta : x ∈ R 7→ 1 − ax2
(a > −1/4) and the associated family of geometric pressure functions t ∈ R 7→ P (−t log |dTa|)
given by

(1)

P (−t log |dTa|) = sup

µ (cid:26)hµ(Ta) − tZ log |dTa|dµ(cid:27) .

Here, hµ(Ta) denotes the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of (Ta, µ) and the supremum is taken over
all Ta-invariant Borel probability measures.

For a > 2, the Julia set does not contain the critical point x = 0, and so the dynamics is
uniformly hyperbolic and structurally stable. According to the classical theory, for any t ∈ R
there exists a unique equilibrium measure for the potential −t log |dTa|, and the geometric
pressure function is real analytic. At the ﬁrst bifurcation parameter a = 2 the Julia set
contains the critical point, and so the dynamics is nonhyperbolic and structurally unstable.
The Lyapunov exponent of any ergodic measure is either log 2 or log 4, and it is log 4 only
for the Dirac measure, denoted by δ−1, at the orientation-preserving ﬁxed point. Equilibrium
measures for the potential −t log |dT2| are: (i) δ−1 if t < −1; (ii) δ−1 and µac if t = −1; (iii)
µac if t > −1, where µac denotes the absolutely continuous invariant probability measure.
Correspondingly, the pressure function is not real analytic at t = −1:

P (−t log |dT2|) =(−t log 4 if t ≤ −1;

(1 − t) log 2 if t > −1.

We say T2 displays the freezing phase transition in negative spectrum, to be deﬁned below (see
the paragraph just before the Main Theorem).

This phase transition is due to the fact that the measure δ−1 is anomalous:

it has the
maximal Lyapunov exponent, and this value is isolated in the set of Lyapunov exponents of
all ergodic measures. For all a ∈ (−1/4, 2) the Dirac measure at the orientation preserving
ﬁxed point continues to be anomalous, and therefore all the quadratic maps continue to
display the freezing phase transition [8, Proposition 4]. The freezing phase transition in
negative spectrum is often caused by anomalous periodic points. For example, see [11] for
results on certain two-dimensional real polynomial endomorphism, and [12] for a complete
characterization on rational maps of degree ≥ 2 on the Riemannian sphere.
An elementary observation is that any nonhyperbolic one-dimensional map suﬃciently close
to T2 in the C 2-topology displays the freezing phase transition in negative spectrum. This
raises the following question: is it possible to remove the phase transition of T2 by an arbitrar-
ily small singular perturbation to higher dimensional nonhyperbolic maps? More precisely we
ask:

(Removability problem) Is it possible to “approximate” T2 : x ∈ R 7→ 1 − 2x2 by higher
dimensional nonhyperbolic maps which do not display the freezing phase transition in negative
spectrum?

Figure 1. Organization of the invariant manifolds at a = a∗. There exist two
ﬁxed saddles P , Q near (1/2, 0), (−1, 0) respectively. In the case det Df > 0
(left), W s(Q) meets W u(Q) tangentially. In the case det Df < 0 (right), W s(Q)
meets W u(P ) tangentially. The shaded regions represent the rectangle R (See
Sect.2.1).

The aim of this paper is to show that the phase transition of T2 can be removed, by an
arbitrarily small singular perturbation along the ﬁrst bifurcation curve of a family of H´enon-
like diﬀeomorphisms

fa : (x, y) ∈ R2 7→ (1 − ax2, 0) + b · Φ(a, b, x, y),

a ∈ R, 0 < b ≪ 1,

where a is near 2, Φ is bounded continuous in a, b, x, y and C 2 in a, x, y. The parameter a
controls the nonlinearity, and the b controls the dissipation of the map. Note that, with b = 0
the family degenerates into the family of quadratic maps.

We proceed to recall some known facts on the ﬁrst bifurcation of the family of H´enon-like
diﬀeomorphisms. If there is no fear of confusion, we suppress a from notation and write f
for fa, and so on. For (a, b) near (2, 0) let P , Q denote the ﬁxed saddles of f near (1/2, 0)
and (−1, 0) respectively. The stable and unstable manifolds of P are respectively deﬁned as
follows:

W s(P ) = {z ∈ R2 : f n(z) → P as n → +∞};
W u(P ) = {z ∈ R2 : f n(z) → P as n → −∞}.

The stable and unstable manifolds of Q are deﬁned in the same way. It is known [1, 6, 7, 22]
that there is a ﬁrst bifurcation parameter a∗ = a∗(b) ∈ R with the following properties:

• if a > a∗, then the non wandering set is a uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe;
• if a = a∗, then there is a single orbit of homoclinic or heteroclinic tangency involving
(one of) the two ﬁxed saddles (see FIGURE 1). In the case det Df > 0 (orientation
preserving), W s(Q) meets W u(Q) tangentially. In the case det Df < 0 (orientation
reversing), W s(Q) meets W u(P ) tangentially. The tangency is quadratic, and the one-
parameter family {fa}a∈R unfolds the tangency at a∗ generically. An incredibly rich
array of dynamical complexities is unleashed in the unfolding of this tangency (see
e.g., [15] and the references therein);

• a∗ → 2 as b → 0.

The curve {(a∗(b), b) ∈ R : b > 0} is a nonhyperbolic path to the quadratic map T2, consisting of
parameters corresponding to nonhyperbolic dynamics. The main theorem claims that fa∗(b),b
does not display the freezing phase transition in negative spectrum.

to a∗∗ (upper-right); det Df > 0 and a = a∗∗ (upper-left); det Df < 0 and
a > a∗∗ close to a∗∗ (lower-right); det Df < 0 and a = a∗∗ (lower-left).

To give a precise statement of result we need a preliminary discussion. We ﬁrst make
explicit the range of the parameter a to consider. Assume 0 < b ≪ 1. Let W s
loc(Q) denote the
compact curve in W s(Q) containing Q such that W s
loc(Q)\{Q} has two connected components
of length √b. Let ψ : R → W u(Q) denote the isometric embedding such that ψ(0) = Q and
ψ({x ∈ R : x < 0}) ∩ Ω = ∅. Let

ℓu =(ψ(1 − 1/100, 1 + 1/100)
ψ(3 − 1/100, 3 + 1/100)

if det Df > 0;
if det Df < 0.

G = {a ∈ R : f −2(W s

loc(Q)) and ℓu bounds a compact domain},

Deﬁne

and

a∗∗ = inf G.

Note that a∗ ∈ G, a∗∗ < a∗, a∗∗ → 2 as b → 0, and that at a = a∗∗, f −2(W s
loc(Q)) is tangent
to ℓu quadratically. Since the family {fa}a unfolds the tangency ζ0 at a = a∗ generically,
(a∗∗, a∗] ⊂ G. In this paper we assume a ∈ (a∗∗, a∗].
Let Ω denote the non wandering set of f , which is a compact f -invariant set. For nonhyper-
bolic dynamics beyond the parameter a∗, the notion of “unstable direction” is not clear. In the
next paragraph, we circumvent this point with the Pesin theory (See e.g., [9]), by introducing
a Borel set Λ on which an unstable direction Eu makes sense.

Given χ > ǫ > 0, for each integer k ≥ 1 deﬁne Λk(χ, ǫ) to be the set of points z ∈ Ω for
z of TzR2 such that for every integers m ∈ Z,

which there is a one-dimensional subspace Eu
n ≥ 1 and for all vectors vu ∈ Df m(Eu
z ),

kDf m(z)f −n(vu)k ≤ eǫke−(χ−ǫ)neǫ|m|kvuk.

z is continuous. Moreover, if z ∈ Λk(χ, ǫ) then f (z), f −1(z) ∈

Λk+1(χ, ǫ). Therefore, the Borel set

Λ(χ, ǫ) =

which we call an unstable Lyapunov exponent of µ ∈ M0(f ). Let us call any measure in
M(f ) which attains the supremum in P (−t log J u) an equilibrium measure for the potential
−t log J u.
We suggest the reader to compare (1) and (3). One important diﬀerence is that the function
log |dTa| in (1) is unbounded, while the function log J u in (3) is bounded. Another important
diﬀerence is that the class of measures taken into consideration is reduced in (3).
It is natural to ask in which case M0(f ) = M(f ). This is the case for a = a∗ because
Λ = Ω from the result in [17]. In fact, M0(f ) = M(f ) still holds for “most” parameters
immediately right after the ﬁrst bifurcation at a∗. See Sect.4.2 for more details.
The potential −t log J u and the associated pressure function deserve to be called geo-
metric, primarily because Bowen’s formula holds at a = a∗ [18, Theorem B]: the equation
P (−t log J u) = 0 has the unique solution which coincides with the (unstable) Hausdorﬀ di-
mension of Ω. We expect that the same formula holds for the above “most” parameters.

We are in position to state our main result. Let

λu
m = inf{λu(µ) : µ ∈ M0(f )};
M = sup{λu(µ) : µ ∈ M0(f )},

and deﬁne freezing points tc, tf by

tc = inf {t ∈ R : P (−t log J u) > −tλu
tf = sup{t ∈ R : P (−t log J u) > −tλu

m}.

This denomination is because equilibrium measures do not change any more for t < tc or
t > tf . Indeed it is elementary to show the following:

• −∞ ≤ tc < 0 < tf ≤ +∞;
• if t ∈ (tc, tf ), then any equilibrium measure for −t log J u (if it exists) has positive
• if t ≤ tc, then P (−t log J u) = −tλu

Main Theorem. Let {fa} be a family of H´enon-like diﬀeomorphisms. If b > 0 is suﬃciently
small and a ∈ (a∗∗(b), a∗(b)], then fa does not display the freezing phase transition in negative
spectrum. If a = a∗(b), then P (−t log J u) = −tλu

M + o(1) as t → −∞.

The main theorem states that the graph of the pressure function does not touch the line
M . At a = a∗ we have more information: this line is the asymptote of the graph of

−tλu
P (−t log J u) as t → −∞ (see FIGURE 4).
The main theorem reveals a diﬀerence between the bifurcation structure of quadratic maps
and that of H´enon-like maps from the thermodynamic point of view. As mentioned earlier, the
quadratic maps display the freezing phase transition in negative spectrum for all parameters
beyond the bifurcation, while this is not the case for H´enon-like maps.

The freezing phase transition for negative spectrum does occur for some parameters < a∗∗.
It is well-known that there exists a parameter set of positive Lebesgue measure corresponding
to non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors [2, 13, 24]. For these parameters, the non-
wandering set is the disjoint union of the strange attractor and the ﬁxed saddle near (−1, 0)
[4, 5]. For these parameters it is possible to show that the Dirac measure at the saddle is
anomalous.

Regarding freezing phase transitions in positive spectrum of H´enon-like maps, the known
result is very much limited. Let δQ denote the Dirac measure at Q. It was proved in [23,
Proposition 3.5(b)] that if a = a∗ and λu
m = (1/2)λu(δQ), then f does not display the freezing
m → log 2 and λu(δQ) → log 4 as
phase transition in positive spectrum. However, since λu
b → 0, it is not easy to prove or disprove this equality.
For a proof of the main theorem we ﬁrst show that δQ is the unique measure which maximizes
the unstable Lyapunov exponent (see Lemma 2.4). Then it suﬃces to show that for any t < 0
there exists a measure νt ∈ M0(f ) such that hνt(f )− tλu(νt) > −tλu(δQ). To see the subtlety
of showing this, note that from the variational principle νt must satisfy

t (λu(νt) − λu(δQ)) < hνt(f ) ≤ htop(f ),

(4)
where htop(f ) denotes the topological entropy of f . As −t becomes large, the unstable Lya-
punov exponent becomes more important and we must have λu(νt) → λu(δQ) as t → −∞.
A naive application of the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Smale theorem [15] to a transverse homoclinic
point of Q indeed yields a measure whose unstable Lyapunov exponent is approximately that
of δQ, but it is not clear if the entropy is suﬃciently large for the ﬁrst inequality in (4) to hold.
Our approach is based on the well-known inducing techniques adapted to the H´enon-like
maps, inspired by Makarov & Smirnov [12] (see also Leplaideur [10]). The idea is to carefully
choose for each t < 0 a hyperbolic subset Ht of Ω such that the ﬁrst return map to it is
topologically conjugate to the full shift on a ﬁnite number of symbols. We then spread out
the maximal entropy measure of the ﬁrst return map to produce a measure with the desired
properties. As −t becomes large, more symbols are needed in order to fulﬁll the ﬁrst inequality
in (4).
The hyperbolic set Ht is chosen in such a way that any orbit contained in it spends a very
large proportion of time near the saddle Q, during which the unstable directions are roughly
parallel to Eu
Q. More precisely, for any point z ∈ Ht with the ﬁrst return time R(z) to Ht, the
fraction

#{n ∈ {0, 1, . . . , R(z) − 1} : |f n(z) − Q| ≪ 1 and angle(Eu

is nearly 1. A standard bounded distortion argument then allows us to copy the unstable
Lyapunov exponent of δQ. Note that, if the unstable direction is not continuous (which is
indeed the case at a = a∗ [18] and considered to be the case for most a < a∗), then the
closeness of base points |f n(z)− Q| ≪ 1 does not guarantee the closeness of the corresponding
unstable directions angle(Eu
In order to let points stay near the saddle Q for a very long period of time, one must allow
them to enter deeply into the critical zone. As a price to pay, the directions of Eu along
the orbits get switched due to the folding behavior near the critical zone. In order to restore
the horizontality of the direction and establish the closeness to Eu
Q, we develop the binding
argument relative to dynamically critical points, inspired by Benedicks & Carleson [2]. The
point is that one can choose the hyperbolic set Ht so that the eﬀect of the folding is not
signiﬁcant, and the restoration can be done in a uniformly bounded time. This argument
works at the ﬁrst bifurcation parameter a∗, and even for all parameters in (a∗∗, a∗) because
only those parts in the phase space not being destroyed by the homoclinic bifurcation are
involved.

The rest of this paper consists of three sections. In Sect.2 we introduce the key concept of
critical points, and develop estimates related to them. In Sect.3 we use the results in Sect.2
to construct the above-mentioned hyperbolic set. In Sect.4 we ﬁnish the proof of the main
theorem and provide more details, on the abundance of parameters satisfying M0(f ) = M(f ).

2. Local analysis near critical orbits

For the rest of this paper, we assume f = fa and a ∈ (a∗∗, a∗]. In this section we develop
a local analysis near the orbits of critical points. The main result is Proposition 2.7 which
controls the norms of the derivatives in the unstable direction, along orbits which pass through
critical points.

For the rest of this paper we are concerned with the following positive small constants: τ ,

δ, b chosen in this order, the purposes of which are as follows:
• τ is used to exclusively in the proof of Proposition 2.7;
• δ determines the size of a critical region (See Sect.2.5);
• b determines the magnitude of the reminder term in (1).

We shall write C with or without indices to denote any constant which is independent of τ , δ,
b. For A, B > 0 we write A ≈ B if both A/B and B/A are bounded from above by constants
independent of τ , δ, b. If A ≈ B and the constants can be made arbitrarily close to 1 by
appropriately choosing τ , δ, b, then we write A ≍ B.
For a nonzero tangent vector v = (cid:0) ξ
η(cid:1) at a point z ∈ R2, deﬁne slope(v) = |η|/|ξ| if ξ 6= 0,
and slope(v) = ∞ if ξ = 0. Similarly, for the one-dimensional subspace V of TzR2 spanned by
v, deﬁne slope(V ) = slope(v). Given a C 1 curve γ in R2, the length is denoted by length(γ).
The tangent space of γ at z ∈ γ is denoted by Tzγ. The Euclidean distance between two
points z1, z2 of R2 is denoted by |z1 − z2|. The angle between two tangent vectors v1, v2 is
denoted by angle(v1, v2). The interior of a subset X of R2 is denoted by Int(X).

2.1. The non wandering set. Recall that the map f has exactly two ﬁxed points, which are
saddles: P is the one near (1/2, 0) and Q is the other one near (−1, 0). The orbit of tangency
at the ﬁrst bifurcation parameter a = a∗ intersects a small neighborhood of the origin (0, 0)

exactly at one point, denoted by ζ0. If det Df > 0 then ζ0 ∈ W s(Q) ∩ W u(Q). If det Df < 0
then ζ0 ∈ W s(Q) ∩ W u(P ) (See FIGURE 1).
By a rectangle we mean any compact domain bordered by two compact curves in W u(P ) ∪
W u(Q) and two in W s(P ) ∪ W s(Q). By an unstable side of a rectangle we mean any of the
two boundary curves in W u(P ) ∪ W u(Q). A stable side is deﬁned similarly.
In the case det Df > 0 (resp. det Df < 0) let R = Ra denote the rectangle which is
bordered by two compact curves in W u(Q) (resp. W u(P )) and two in W s(Q), and contains
Ω. The rectangle with these properties is unique, and is located near the segment {(x, 0) ∈
R2 : |x| ≤ 1}. One of the stable sides of R contains Q, which is denoted by α−
0 . The other
stable side of R is denoted by α+
0 . At a = a∗, one of the unstable sides
of R contains the point ζ0 of tangency near (0, 0) (See FIGURE 1).

By a C 2(b)-curve we mean a compact, nearly horizontal C 2 curve in R such that the slopes

of tangent vectors to it are ≤ √b and the curvature is everywhere ≤ √b.

slope(Df n(v)) ≤

√b and kDf n(v)k ≥ δeλ0nkvk.

If moreover f n(z) ∈ I(δ), then kDf n(v)k ≥ eλ0nkvk.

2.3. Lyapunov maximizing measure. Recall that M0(f ) is the set of f -invariant Borel
probability measures which gives total mass to the set Λ. The next lemma states that δQ
is the unique measure which maximizes the unstable Lyapunov exponent among measures in
M0(f ).
Lemma 2.4. For any µ ∈ M0(f ) \ {δQ}, λu(µ) < λu(δQ).
Proof. From the linearity of the unstable Lyapunov exponent as a function of measures, it
suﬃces to consider the case where µ is ergodic. Let

supp(µ) =\{F : F is a closed subset of Ω and µ(F ) = 1}.

2.4. C 1-closeness due to disjointness. Corollary 2.6 below states that the pointwise con-
vergence of pairwise disjoint C 2(b)-curves implies the C 1-convergence. This fact was already
used in the precious works for H´enon-like maps, e.g., [17, 18]. We include precise statements
and proofs for the reader’s convenience.

Lemma 2.5. Let ε ∈ (0, (1 + √b)−2) and let γ1, γ2 be two disjoint C 2(b)-curves parametrized

by arc length such that:

(i) γ1(s), γ2(s) are deﬁned for s ∈ [−ε, ε];
(ii) |γ1(0) − γ2(0)| ≤ ε2.
Then the following holds:
(a) angle(Tγ1(0)γ1, Tγ2(0)γ2) ≤ √ε;
(b) |γ1(s) − γ2(s)| ≤ 2ε

2 for all s ∈ [−ε, ε].

3

Proof. Write L(s) = γ1(s) − γ2(s). By the mean value theorem, for any t in between 0 and
s there exists θ(t) in between 0 and t such that ˙L(t) = ˙L(0) + ¨L(θ(t))t, where the dot “ · ”
denotes the t-derivative. Integrating this equality gives

(6)

L(s) = L(0) +Z s

˙L(t)dt = L(0) + ˙L(0)s +Z s

≤ |L(0)| + 2√bε2 ≤ ε2 + 2√bε2 < k ˙L(0)kε.

We argue by contradiction assuming k ˙L(0)k > (1/2)√ε. The assumption ε < (1 + √b)−2, (ii)
and | ¨L| ≤ 2√b give
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

A comparison of (6) with (7) shows that the sign of L(ε) coincides with that of k ˙L(0)kε.
The same argument shows that the sign of L(−ε) coincides with that of −k ˙L(0)kε. From the
intermediate value theorem it follows that L(s) = 0 for some s, namely γ1 intersects γ2, a
contradiction. Hence angle(Tγ1(0)γ1, Tγ2(0)γ2) < 2k ˙L(0)k ≤ √ε and (a) holds. (b) follows from
(6), (ii), (a) and | ¨L| ≤ 2√b.
Corollary 2.6. Let {γn}+∞
n=0 be a sequence of pairwise disjoint C 2(b)-curves which as a se-
quence of C 2 functions converges pointwise to a function γ as n → +∞. Then the graph of γ
is a C 1-curve and the slopes of its tangent directions are everywhere ≤ √b.

Proof. From Lemma 2.5(b), the pointwise convergence implies the uniform C 0 convergence.
From Lemma 2.5(a), the uniform C 1 convergence follows.

Let γ be a C 2(b)-curve in I(δ). We say ζ ∈ γ is a critical point on γ if ζ ∈ S and f (γ) is
tangent to F s(f (ζ)). If ζ is a critical point on a C 2(b)-curve γ, then we say γ admits ζ. For
simplicity, we sometimes refer to ζ as a critical point without referring to γ.
Let ζ be a critical point. Note that f (ζ) ∈ U +, and the forward orbit of f (ζ) spends a long
time in U −. Hence it inherits the exponential growth of derivatives near the ﬁxed saddle Q.

More precisely, from the bounded distortion near the ﬁxed saddle Q,

for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n(ζ)}.

2.6. Binding to critical points. In order to deal with the eﬀect of returns to I(δ), we now
establish a binding argument in the spirit of Benedicks & Carleson [2] which allows one to bind
generic orbits which fall inside I(δ) to suitable critical points, to let it copy the exponential
growth along the piece of the critical orbit.

Let ζ be a critical point and let z ∈ I(δ) \ {ζ}. We deﬁne a bound period p = p(ζ, z) in
the following manner. Consider the leaf F s(f (ζ)) of the stable foliation through f (ζ). This
leaf is expressed as a graph of a C 2 function: there exists an open interval J containing 0 and
independent of b, and a C 2 function y 7→ xs(y) on J such that
F s(f (ζ)) = {(xs(y), y) : y ∈ J}.

Proposition 2.7. Let γ be a C 2(b)-curve in I(δ) and ζ a critical point on γ. Let z ∈ γ \ {ζ}
and p = p(ζ, z). Then the following holds.

(I) If p ≤ n(ζ), then:

(a) p ≈ − log |ζ − z|;
(b) f i(z) ∈ U for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p − 1};
(c) let v denote any nonzero vector tangent to γ at z. Then kDzf p(v)k ≥ eλ0(p−i)kDzf i(v)k

for every i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}. In particular, slope(Dzf p(v)) ≤ √b;

(II) If p = n(ζ) + 1, then f n(ζ)(z) /∈ R.
A proof of Proposition 2.7 is lengthy. Before entering it we give a couple of remarks and

prove one lemma which will be used later.
z ) ≤ √b. We claim that if there
Remark 2.8. Let z ∈ I(δ) ∩ Λ and suppose that slope(Eu
exists a C 2(b)-curve which is tangent to Eu
z and contains a critical point ζ, then p(ζ, z) ≤ n(ζ)
holds. For otherwise p(ζ, z) = n(ζ) + 1, and Proposition 2.7(II) gives f n(ζ)(z) /∈ R. Since
z ∈ Λ ⊂ Ω ⊂ R a contradiction arises.
Remark 2.9. As a by-product of the proof of Proposition 2.7 it follows that any C 2(b)-curve
in I(δ) admits at most one critical point.

Let α+

1 denote the connected component of R∩ W s(P ) containing P , and α−

1 the connected

component of W s(P )∩ f −1(α+

1 and the unstable sides of R. Note that

S ⊂ I(δ) ⊂ Θ.

Lemma 2.10. Let γ be a C 2(b)-curve in I(δ) which admits a critical point. If n ≥ 1 is such
that Int(Θ) ∩ f i(γ) = ∅ for every i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} and Int(Θ) ∩ f n(γ) 6= ∅, then any
connected component of Θ ∩ f n(γ) is a C 2(b)-curve.
Proof. By Lemma 2.3 it suﬃces to show that for any z ∈ γ with f n(z) ∈ Θ and a nonzero
vector v tangent to γ at z, kDf n(v)k ≥ δkDf i(v)k holds for every i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. This
is a consequence of Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.7(I)(c).

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 2.7. We start with establishing three preliminary estimates.
Estimate 1 (horizontal distance). Let F s(f (ζ)) = {(xs(y), y)} denote the leaf of the foliation
through f (ζ) as in Sect.2.5. Write f (z) = (x0, y0). In the ﬁrst step we estimate |x0 − xs(y0)|.
sin θ(ζ)(cid:17), θ(ζ) ≍ π/2. Deﬁne two functions
Write f (ζ) = (xs(y1), y1) and es(f (ζ)) = (cid:16) cos θ(ζ)
0(cid:19) + η ·(cid:18)cos θ(ζ)
sin θ(ζ)(cid:19) .

We also have

Parametrize the C 2(b)-curve γ by arc length s so that that γ(s0) = z and γ(s1) = ζ. Then

|y0 − y1| ≤ |η(y0)|.

|A(γ(s))| ≍ 2|γ(s) − ζ| and |B(γ(s))| ≤ C√b.
|ξ(x0, y0)| ≍ 2|z − ζ|2 and |η(y0)| ≤ C√b|z − ζ|.

Integrations from s = s0 to s1 gives

(13)

Using (10) (11) for y = y0 and the second estimate in (13) we obtain

(14)

This yields

|ξ(xs(y0), y0)| ≤ C|y0 − y1|2 ≤ C|η(y0)|2 ≤ Cb|ξ(x0, y0)|.

|x0 − xs(y0)| = |ξ(x0, y0) − ξ(xs(y0), y0)| ≍ 2|ζ − z|2.

(15)
This implies that the tangency between f (γ) and F s(f (ζ)) at f (ζ) is quadratic. If there were
two critical points on γ, then the two leaves through the critical values intersect each other.
This is absurd because the leaves of the foliation F s are integral curves of C 1 vector ﬁelds.
Estimate 2 (slopes and lengths of iterated curves). Let l denote the straight segment connecting
f (z) = (x0, y0) and (xs(y0), y0) ∈ F s(f (ζ)). Arguing inductively, it is possible to show that
for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p − 1} the slopes of tangent directions of f i(l) are everywhere ≤ √b,
and

length(f i(l)) ≍ length(l)kwi+1(ζ)k ≤ Dp−1(ζ)kwi+1(ζ)k

This yields

(19)

1 ≤ |ζ − z|βkwq+1(ζ)k ≤ |ζ − z|β5q.

q ≥ log |ζ − z|− β

log 5 .

Proof of Proposition 2.7 (continued). Recall that any closed ball of radius √τ about a point
in α−
0 is contained in U. Hence, the conditions f n(ζ)(ζ) ∈ U −, f n(ζ)+1(ζ) /∈ U − and the
hyperbolicity of the ﬁxed saddle Q altogether imply that there is a ball of radius of order √τ
about f n(ζ)−1(ζ) which is contained in U. Since p ≤ n(ζ), for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p − 1} there
is a ball of radius of order √τ about f i(ζ) which is contained in U. Since length(f i−1(l)) < τ
as above, we obtain |f i(ζ) − f i(z)| < length(f i−1(l)) + (Cb)i ≪ √τ , and therefore f i(z) ∈ U

and (a) holds.

Using (15) (16) and (9) we have

|ζ − z|2 < Dp−1(ζ) ≈ τ e−λu(δQ)p.

Taking logs of both sides and rearranging the result gives p ≤ − log |ζ − z|
2 log 2 because
λu(δQ) → log 4 as b → 0. Since 3|ζ − z|2 > Dp(ζ), the lower estimate follows similarly and (b)
holds.

length(f n(ζ)−1(l)) < τ we have |f n(ζ)(ζ) − f n(ζ)(z)| < length(f n(ζ)−1(l)) + (Cb)n ≪ √τ . This

3. Global construction

In this section we use the results in Sect.2 to construct an induced system with uniformly
hyperbolic behavior. From the induced system we extract a hyperbolic set, the dynamics on
which is conjugate to the full shift on a ﬁnite number of symbols. This hyperbolic set will be
used to complete the proof of the main theorem in the next section.

REMOVAL OF PHASE TRANSITION OF THE CHEBYSHEV QUADRATIC

3.1. Construction of induced system. In this subsection we deliberately construct an
induced system with uniformly hyperbolic Markov structure, with countably inﬁnite number
of branches. Although a similar construction has been done in [23] at a = a∗ to analyze
equilibrium measures for the potential −t log J u as t → +∞, it does not ﬁt to our purpose of
studying the case t → −∞. Moreover, a treatment of the case a∗∗ < a < a∗ brings additional
diﬃculties which are not present in [23]. We exploit the geometric structure of invariant
manifolds of P and Q which are “not destroyed yet” by the homoclinic bifurcation.

We say a C 2(b)-curve γ in R stretches across Θ if both endpoints of γ are contained in
the stable sides of Θ. Let ω, ω′ be two rectangles in Θ such that ω ⊂ ω′. We call ω a
u-subrectangle of ω′ if each stable side of ω′ contains one stable side of ω. Similarly, we call ω
an s-subrectangle of ω′ if each unstable side of ω′ contains one unstable side of ω.
Proposition 3.1. There exist a u-subrectangle Θ′ of Θ, a large integer k0 ≥ 1, a constant
C ∈ (0, 1) and a countably inﬁnite family {ωk}k≥k0 of s-subrectangles of Θ′ with the following
properties:
(a) the unstable sides of Θ′ are C 2(b)-curves stretching across Θ and intersecting Int(S);
(b) for every nonzero vector v tangent to the unstable side of Θ′ and every integer n > 0,

kDf −n(v)k ≤ e−λ0nkvk;
u-subrectangle of Θ′ whose unstable sides are C 2(b)-curves stretching across Θ′;

(c) for each ωk, Int(Θ) ∩ f i(ωk) = ∅ for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k − 1}, and f k(ωk) is a
(d) if z ∈ ωk ∩ Ω and slope(Eu

z ) ≤ √b, then kDf k|Eu

zk ≥ Ceλu(δQ)k.

Set ˜α0 = α+

1 and ˜α1 = α−

Proof. Since the construction is involved, we start with giving a brief sketch. Let γ0 denote
the C 2(b)-curve in W u which stretches across Θ and is part of the boundary of S. This curve,
which obviously satisﬁes the exponential backward contraction property as in item (b), will
be one of the unstable sides of Θ′. In Step 1 we ﬁnd another C 2(b)-curve stretching across Θ,
which will be the other unstable side of Θ′. In Step 2 we construct the rectangles {ωk}k≥k0
by subdividing Θ′ into smaller rectangles, with a family of compact curves in W s(P ). Both
of the steps depend on the orientation of the map f .
Step 1 (construction of Θ′). Suppose that α, α′ are two compact curves in R ∩ W s(P ) which
join the two unstable sides of R and intersect γ0 exactly at one point. We write α ≺ α′ if
proj(α ∩ γ0) < proj(α′ ∩ γ0), where proj denotes the projection to the ﬁrst coordinate.
1 . Let { ˜αk}k≥0 denote the sequence of compact curves in R∩W s(P )
with the following properties: each ˜αk joins the two unstable sides of R; ˜αk ≺ ˜αk−1 and
f ( ˜αk) ⊂ ˜αk−1 for every k ∈ {1, 2, . . .}. Notice that ˜αk converges to α−
For every k ≥ 1 the set R ∩ f −2( ˜αk−1) has three or four connected components. Two
of them are ˜αk+1 and the connected component of R ∩ f −1( ˜αk) which is not ˜αk+1. Let αk
denote the union of the remaining one or two connected components of R ∩ f −2( ˜αk−1). By
deﬁnition, αk is located near the origin (If a = a∗, then for every k ≥ 0, αk has two connected
components. If a∗∗ < a < a∗ then there exists an integer k′ = k′(a) such that αk has two
connected components if and only if k < k′). Choose a large integer ˆk ≥ 1 such that αk ⊂ I(δ)
holds for every k ≥ ˆk.
The rest of the construction of Θ′ depends on the orientation of f . We ﬁrst consider
the case det Df > 0. Let k ≥ ˆk. The set αk intersects γ0 exactly at two points. Let
γ−
k , γ+
k denote the compact curve in γ0 whose endpoints are in αk and αk+1, and satisfy
sup proj(γ−
k ). Since Int(Θ′) ∩ f i(γk) = ∅ for every i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k − 1} and

Remark 3.2. There is no particular reason for our choice of γ+

k does the same

The case det Df < 0 is easier to handle. Since a ∈ (a∗∗, a∗] ⊂ G, there is the unique
compact domain bounded by f −2(W s
loc(Q)) and ℓu, which is contained in S. Deﬁne Θ′ denote
the rectangle bordered by the stable sides of Θ, γ0 and the C 2(b)-curve in W u(Q) which
stretches across Θ and contains ℓu. Items (a) and (b) in Proposition 3.1 hold.
Step 2 (construction of ωk). The set αk ∩ Θ′ consists of two connected components, one at the
left of S and the other at the right of S. Let ˆωk denote the connected component of αk ∩ Θ′
which lies at the right of S. Then f k(ˆωk) is a u-subrectangle of Θ, whose unstable sides are
C 2(b)-curves stretching across Θ.

In the case det Df > 0, choose a suﬃciently large integer k0 > ˆk depending on the parameter
a such that for every k ≥ k0, f k(ˆωk) is a u-subrectangle of Θ′. Set ωk = ˆωk. In the case
det Df < 0, f k(ˆωk) may not be contained in Θ′ (See FIGURE 6), and this is always the
case for a < a∗ and suﬃciently large k. However, note that f k+2(ˆωk) contains a unique u-
subrectangle ω′ of Θ′. Set k0 = ˆk + 2 and ωk = f −k(ˆωk−2) for every k ≥ k0. This ﬁnishes the
construction of {ωk}k≥k0. Item (c) is a direct consequence of the construction.
To prove item (d) we need the next uniform upper bound on the length of bound periods.
Lemma 3.3. There is a constant E > 0 such that if z ∈Sk≥k0
a C 2(b)-curve which is tangent to v, then p(ζ, z) ≤ E.
Proof. Let z, ζ be as in the statement of the lemma and assume z ∈ ωk. By construction,
one of the unstable sides of ωk is contained in the C 2(b)-curve γ0 which is not contained in
the unstable sides of Θ and stretches across Θ. Let ζ ′ denote the critical point on γ0. With a
slight abuse of notation, let F s(α+
0 . The leaf F s(f (ζ ′)) lies at
the right of F s(α+

0 ). Since f (z) ∈ R we have

0 ) denote the leaf containing α+

ωk and ζ is a critical point on

0 ), and F s(f (ζ)) lies at the right of F s(α+
3|ζ − z|2 ≥ inf{|z1 − z2| : z1 ∈ F s(α+

0 ), z2 ∈ F s(f (ζ ′))} > 0.
Taking logs of both sides and then using Proposition 2.7(a) yields the claim.

(cid:3)

Since the point z is sandwiched by the two C 2(b)-curves intersecting Int(Θ), there exists a
z and contains a critical point ζ. Let p = p(ζ, z) denote the

C 2(b)-curve which is tangent to Eu
bound period given by Proposition 2.7. Since slope(Eu
n ∈ {n, n + 1, . . . , k − 1} and f k(z) ∈ Θ, the bounded distortion for iterates near Q gives

f p(z)) ≤ √b, f n(z) /∈ Int(Θ) for every

kDf p(z)f k−p|Eu

f p(z)k ≈ eλu(δQ)(k−p).

Using kDf p|Eu

z k > 1 and p ≤ E by Lemma 3.3 we obtain

kDf k|Eu

z k = kDf p|Eu

z k · kDf k−p|Eu

f p(z)k ≥ Ce−λu(δQ)EkDf p(z)f k−p|Eu

f p(z)k,

and hence item (d) holds. This completes the proof of Proposition 3.1.

3.2. Symbolic dynamics. From the induced system in Proposition 3.1 we extract a ﬁnite
number of branches, and construct a conjugacy to the full shift on a ﬁnite number of symbols.
For two positive integers q0, q1 with q0 < q1 deﬁne

Σ(q0, q1) = {a = {ai}i∈Z : ai ∈ {q0, q0 + 1, . . . , q1}}.

This is the set of two-sided sequences with q1 − q0 + 1-symbols. Endow Σ(q0, q1) with the
product topology of the discrete topology of {q0, q0 + 1, . . . , q1}.
Proposition 3.4. For all integers 1 ≤ q0 < q1 there exist a continuous injection π : Σ(q0, q1) →
Ω and a constant C ∈ (0, 1) such that the following holds:

π(a)) ≤ √b;
(a) for every a ∈ Σ(q0, q1), slope(Eu
(b) for every a = {ai}i∈Z ∈ Σ(q0, q1), kDf a0|Eu
(c) a ∈ Σ(q0, q1) 7→ Eu

Ceλu(δQ)ai for every integer i ≥ 1;
π(a) is continuous.

Proof. Let a = {ai}i∈Z ∈ Σ(q0, q1). For each integer j ≥ 1 deﬁne

j is a C 1 curve which

The right-hand side goes to 0 as m → ∞. This means that π is well-deﬁned.
The continuity of π is obvious. To show the injectivity, assume a 6= a′ and π(a) = π(a′).
Then there exists an integer i such that f i(π(a)) belongs to two rectangles in {ωk}q1
k=q0, namely
belongs to a curve in ∪k≥k0αk which is a stable side of two neighboring rectangles. It follows
that f a0+a1+···+ai(π(a)) ∈ α+
1 holds for all large integer i > 0. On the other hand, the
deﬁnition of π gives f a0+a1+···+ai(π(a)) ∈ ωai. Since ωai ∩ α+
1 = ∅ by construction, we obtain
a contradiction.
Recall that the unstable direction is characterized by the exponential backward contraction
property (2). By Corollary 2.6 and the fact that the C 1-curve T+∞
is obtained as the
C 1-limit of the unstable sides of {ωu
j }j≥1. To prove items (a) and (c) it suﬃces to show that

Then Item (b) is a consequence of the construction of π and Proposition 3.1(d).

It is left to prove (25). For each i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , j} deﬁne an integer ni ≤ 0 by f ni(γ) ∈ ωai.

Note that n1 < n2 < . . . < nj−1 < nj = 0. Below we treat four cases separately.
Case I: −n = ni for some i. We split the time interval [ni, 0] into subintervals [nl, nl+1]
(l = i, i + 1, . . . , j − 1). Then we apply the derivative estimates in Lemma 2.2 and Proposition
2.7(c) to [nl, nl + pl] and [nl + pl, nl+1] respectively. Recall that λu(δQ) → log 4 as b → 0 and
λ0 = 99

100 log 2. We obtain

(26)

kDf −n(z)f n(v)k ≥ j−1
Yl=i

eλ0(nl+1−nl)!kvk = eλ0(nj−ni)kvk = eλ0nkvk.
Case II: ni + pi ≤ −n < ni+1 for some i. Since f ni+1(z) ∈ I(δ), Lemma 2.2 gives

kDf −n(z)f ni+1+n(v)k ≥ eλ0(ni+1+n)kvk.

Using this and (26) with −n = ni+1 we get
kDf −n(z)f n(v)k = kDf ni+1 (z)f −ni+1(Df −n(z)f ni+1+n(v))k
Case III: ni < −n < ni + pi. Proposition 2.7(c) gives

kDf −n(z)f ni+1+n(v)k

· kDf −n(z)f ni+1+n(v)k ≥ eλ0nkvk.

Combining this with the result in Case II yields the desired inequality.

kDf −n(z)f ni+pi+n(v)k ≥ eλ0(ni+pi+n)kvk.

REMOVAL OF PHASE TRANSITION OF THE CHEBYSHEV QUADRATIC

Case IV: −n < n1. Since f n1(γ) is contained in the unstable sides of Θ′, Proposition 3.1(b)
gives kDf −n(z)f n1+n(v)k ≥ eλ0(n1+n)kvk. From this and (26) with −n = n1 we get the desired
inequality.

4. Proof of the Main Theorem

In this section we use the results in Sect.2 and ﬁnish the proof of the main theorem. Finally
we provide more details on the main theorem, on the abundance of parameters beyond a∗
satisfying M0(f ) = M(f ).
4.1. Proof of the main theorem. By virtue of Lemma 2.4, the removability in the main
theorem follows from the next

Proposition 4.1. For any t < 0 there exists a measure µ ∈ M(f ) such that

hµ(f ) − tλu(µ) > −tλu(δQ).

Proof. Let q > 0 be the square of a large integer, to be determined later depending on t. Set

Σ(q) = Σ(q − √q + 1, q), and let σ : Σ(q) (cid:9) denote the left shift. For each a ∈ Σ(q) deﬁne
r(a) = Pq−1
i=0 ai. Given a σq-invariant Borel probability measure µ, deﬁne a Borel measure
L(µ) by

a0+a1+···+aq−1−1

L(µ) =

R rdµ X[a0,a1,...,aq−1]

Xi=0

f i
∗(π∗(µ|[a0,a1,...,aq−1])),

where [a0, a1, . . . , aq−1] = {b ∈ Σ(q) : bi = ai, i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , q − 1}} and π : Σ(q) → Ω is the
coding map given by Proposition 3.1. Then L(µ) is an f -invariant and a probability. For
t < 0 deﬁne Φt : Σ(q) → R by

From Proposition 3.4, Φt is continuous and satisﬁes

Φt(a) = −t log kDf r(a)|Eu

π(a)k.

Since q2/2 ≤ r(a) ≤ q2 and 0 < C < 1 we have

Φt(a) ≥ −tq log C − tr(a)λu(δQ).

Φt(a)

r(a) ≥ −2t log C

− tλu(δQ).

Let µ0 denote the measure of maximal entropy of σq. For each integer n ≥ 1 set Pn = {a ∈
Σ(q) : σqn(a) = a}. Since r and Φt are continuous, as n → ∞ we have

#Pn Xa∈Pn

It follows that

for otherwise we would obtain a contradiction. Since the entropy of (σq, µ0) is q log √q and
R rdµ0 ≤ q2 we obtain
P (−t log J u) ≥ h(L(µ0)) − tZ log J udL(µ0) =

The strict inequality in the last line holds provided q > e4t log C.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.2. It is not hard to show that the set π(Σ(q)) is a hyperbolic set. However we do
not need this fact.

To ﬁnish, it is left to show P (−t log J u) = −tλu

M + o(1) as t → −∞ provided a = a∗.
According to [23] let us call a measure µ ∈ M(f ) a (−)-ground state if there exists a sequence
{tn}n, tn ց −∞ such that µtn is an equilibrium measure for −tn log J u and µtn converges
weakly to µ as n → ∞. If P (−t log J u)+λu
M t 9 0 as t → −∞, then the upper semi-continuity
of entropy (see [17]) would imply the existence of a (−)-ground state with positive entropy.
If det Df > 0, we obtain a contradiction to [23, Thereom A(b)] which states that the Dirac
measure at Q is the unique (−)-ground state. Even if det Df < 0, the proof of [23, Thereom
A(b)] works and we obtain the same contradiction. This completes the proof of the main
theorem.
(cid:3)
4.2. Abundance of parameters satisfying M0(f ) = M(f ). In the main theorem we have
reduced the class of measures to consider: only those measures which give full weight to the
Borel set Λ were taken into consideration. To claim that M0(f ) = M(f ) holds for many
parameters except a∗, some preliminary discussions are necessary.
From the Oseledec theorem [14] and the two-dimensionality of the system, one of the fol-

lowing holds for each measure µ ∈ M(f ) which is ergodic:

(a) there exist a real number χ(µ) such that for µ-a.e. z ∈ Ω and for any vector v ∈

TzR2 \ {0},
lim

n→±∞

n

(b) there exist two real numbers χ1(µ) < χ2(µ) and for µ-a.e. z ∈ Ω a non-trivial splitting

log kDf n(v)k = χ(µ) and Z log | det Df|dµ = 2χ(µ);
z such that for any vector vi ∈ Ei

z ⊕ E2
log kDf n(vi)k = χi(µ) (i = 1, 2) and Z log | det Df|dµ = χ1(µ) + χ2(µ).

z \ {0} (i = 1, 2),

lim

n→±∞

1
n

TzR2 = E1

We say µ is a hyperbolic measure if (b) holds and χ1(µ) < 0 < χ2(µ).

Lemma 4.3. Every f -invariant ergodic Borel probability measure is a hyperbolic measure if
and only if M0(f ) = M(f ).
Proof. Let µ ∈ M(f ) be ergodic. Then µ(Λ) = 1 if and only if µ is a hyperbolic measure, see
e.g., [9]. The “if” part follows from this. The “only if” part is a consequence of the ergodic
decomposition of invariant Borel probability measures.
(cid:3)

It was proved in [21, 22] that if additionally {fa} is C 4 in a, x, y, then for suﬃciently small
b > 0 there exists a set ∆ of a-values in (a∗∗, a∗] containing a∗ with the following properties:

In other words, the dynamics for parameters in ∆ is like Smale’s horseshoe. However, whether
or not the dynamics is uniformly hyperbolic for a ∈ ∆ \ {a∗} is a wide open problem. We
even do not know if there exists an increasing sequence of uniformly hyperbolic parameters in
∆ converging to a∗.
