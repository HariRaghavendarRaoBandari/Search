We identify the chiral and angular momentum content of the leading quark-antiquark Fock com-
ponent for the ρ(770) and ρ(1450) mesons using a two-ﬂavor lattice simulation with dynamical
Overlap Dirac fermions. We extract this information from the overlap factors of two interpolating
ﬁelds with diﬀerent chiral structure and from the unitary transformation between chiral and angular
momentum basis. For the chiral content of the mesons we ﬁnd that the ρ(770) slightly favors the
(1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1) chiral representation and the ρ(1450) slightly favors the (1/2, 1/2)b chiral representa-
tion. In the angular momentum basis the ρ(770) is then a 3S1 state, in accordance with the quark
model. The ρ(1450) is a 3D1 state, showing that the quark model wrongly assumes the ρ(1450) to
be a radial excitation of the ρ(770).

INTRODUCTION

The potential constituent quark model has been quite
successful in describing the low-lying hadron spectrum
[1]. Being an eﬀective classiﬁcation scheme, it does not
care about foundations in terms of underlying QCD dy-
namics. Despite its successes the non-relativistic descrip-
tion clearly has limitations.

In this paper we investigate the angular momentum
content of the ρ(770) and ρ(1450) mesons. In the spec-
troscopic notation n 2S+1lJ the ρ(770) is assigned to the
1 3S1 state by the quark model. The ρ(1450) is assigned
to the 2 3S1 state, hence being the ﬁrst radial excita-
tion of the ρ(770). However, this assumption is by far
not clear from the underlying QCD dynamics, and is an
output of the non-relativistic potential description of a
meson as a two-body system.

In principle the angular momentum content of the lead-
ing quark-antiquark Fock components of mesons can be
identiﬁed by a lattice simulation [2–6]. The crucial in-
gredients to such a study are the overlap factors obtained
with operators that form a complete set with respect to
the chiral-parity group. From these overlap factors the
chiral content of a state can be identiﬁed. Then, given a
unitary transformation between the chiral basis and the
2S+1lJ basis we can reconstruct the angular momentum
content. Since the chiral content is important for such
a study we need a lattice fermion discretization, which
respects chiral symmetry. This is why we use overlap
fermions, which distinguishes the present study from the
previous ones.

We ﬁnd in contrast to the previous studies that the
ρ(1450) is practically a pure 1 3D1 state. We will argue
that our result is correct due to a careful analysis of the
signs of the overlap factors.

Further, we remove the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes
of the spectrum, which has been done recently to show
an emergent SU (2Nf ) symmerty in the QCD spectrum.

This symmetry connects all ﬂavors and quark chiralities,
which means in the two-ﬂavor case that uL, uR, dL, dR
are connected with each other. Here we study the eﬀect
of the Dirac eigenmode removal on the overlap factors of
vector and pseudotensor interpolators.

The outline of the article is as follows: In section II we
present the method how to extract the chiral and angu-
lar momentum content of the physical states. In section
III we discuss our simulation parameters and introduce
a resolution scale for our measurements. In section IV
we present our main ﬁndings.
In section V we discuss
the eﬀect of removing the low-lying eigenmodes on the ρ
states. Finally, in section VI we give a short conclusion.

II. FORMALISM

The formalism how to extract chiral and angular mo-
mentum content from lattice correlators has been ex-
plained in detail in Ref. [3]. We review the basic steps.
To generate states with ρ quantum numbers (1, 1−−)
two diﬀerent local interpolators can be used, which be-
long to two distinct chiral representations 1

ρ (x) = ¯Ψ(x)(τ a ⊗ γi)Ψ(x) ∈ (0, 1) ⊕ (1, 0)
J V
ρ (x) = ¯Ψ(x)(τ a ⊗ γ0γi)Ψ(x) ∈ (1/2, 1/2)b.
J T

(1)

(2)

We denote them according to their Dirac structure as
vector (V) and pseudotensor (T) interpolators. Both of
them couple to the physical ρ states. The interpolators
(1), (2) transform diﬀerently under SU (2)L×SU (2)R and
therefore belong to two diﬀerent chiral representations. If
chiral symmetry would be manifest in nature, these two
interpolators would generate two diﬀerent particles and
the index of the irreducible representation of the chiral-
parity group would be an additional quantum number.
In the real world, where chiral symmetry is broken, a
physical ρ-meson is a mixture of two possible chiral rep-
resentations and consequently both interpolators create
the same physical ρ-meson.

1 For a detailed description of the chiral-parity group we refer to

Ref. [7].

In a next step we connect the chiral basis to the angular
momentum basis with quantum numbers isospin I and
2S+1lJ . For spin-1 isovector mesons there are only two
allowed states |1;3 S1(cid:105) and |1;3 D1(cid:105), which are connected
to the chiral basis by a unitary transformation [8]:
|1;3 D1(cid:105) ,

|ρ(0,1)⊕(1,0)(cid:105) =

|1;3 S1(cid:105) +

|ρ(1/2,1/2)b(cid:105) =

This transformation is valid only in the rest frame.

On the lattice we evaluate the correlators (cid:104)J(t)J†(0)(cid:105).
We apply the variational technique, where diﬀerent in-
terpolators are used to construct the correlation matrix
(cid:104)Jl(t)J†
m(0)(cid:105) = C(t)lm. By solving the generalized eigen-
value problem

C(t)lmu(n)

m = λ(n)(t, t0)C(t0)lmu(n)

(5)

the masses of the states can be extracted from the eigen-
values:

1 + O(cid:16)
λ(n)(t, t0) = e−E(n)(t−t0)(cid:16)
(cid:88)

A single entry of the correlation matrix reads

We note that the ratio of eigenvector components ul is
not suited due to the lack of a unique normalization for
diﬀerent operators.

We can extract the ratio aV /aT for each state n. Then
via the unitary transformation (3),(4) we arrive at the
angular momentum content of the ρ mesons.

In Fig. 1 we show the dependence of the partial wave
content of a state on the ratio (8). For example, if the
ρ state is a pure 1 3S1 state, then two diﬀerent chiral
components have to mix in the following way:

2|ρ(0,1)⊕(1,0)(cid:105) + |ρ(1/2,1/2)b(cid:105) = |1;3 S1(cid:105) .

the JLQCD collaboration, see Ref. [9]. The ensemble

consists of 100 conﬁgurations of two-ﬂavor dynamical
Overlap fermions. The topological sector is ﬁxed to
Qtop = 0. Lattice size and spacing are 163×32 at a ∼ 0.12
fm. The pion mass is at mπ = 289(2) MeV [9].

We calculate the isovector correlators with extended
sources with diﬀerent smearing widths of Gaussian type,
described below.

B. Resolution scale via smeared sources

The vector current J V

ρ is conserved, i.e.

its coupling
aV to the physical state should be independent of the
scale. The pseudotensor current J T
ρ is not conserved.
Hence, aT should depend on the scale where it is meas-
ured. Consequently the ratio aV /aT should also depend
on the scale.

An intrinsic resolution scale is set by the lattice spa-
cing a. If we probe the hadron structure with the point-
like source then the result should display a structure of
a hadron that is obtained at the scale ﬁxed by the ultra-
violet regularization a. In principle we could study the
a-dependence by means of diﬀerent lattices with diﬀerent
a. However, such a procedure does not allow to measure
the structure close to the infrared region, i.e. at large a.
Instead of variing a, we can smear the sources of the
quark propagators using diﬀerent widths σ. Clearly,
the smeared source cannot supply us with the inform-
ation about the hadron structure that is sensitive to dis-
tances that are smaller than the smearing width σ. Con-
sequently the smearing width σ deﬁnes a scale at which
we probe the structure of our hadron.

This is done using the Gaussian gauge invariant smear-
ing of the source and sink operators. For a deﬁnition of
the Gaussian (Jacobi) smearing we refer to Ref. [3] and
references therein. We use four diﬀerent smearing widths
in this study. The corresponding proﬁles are given in
Table I. The radius σ of a given source S(x; x0) located

Figure 3. aV /aT ratio for diﬀerent resolutions.

To study the ratio aV /aT at diﬀerent resolution scales
R we solve the 8 × 8 eigenvalue problem (5)-(7) with
operators (1) and (2) and four diﬀerent smearings. Then
using (8) we exctract the ratio aV /aT as a function of R.
In Fig. 3 we show the ratio aV /aT at diﬀerent resolution
scales R. We ﬁnd a clear R-eﬀect on the ratio aV /aT .
For both ρ and ρ(cid:48) states we see a linear dependence on
the resolution scale between 0.2 fm and 0.9 fm.
In the infrared, at the resolution scale 0.9 fm, the ratios
are given by aV /aT = (1.26 ± 0.05) for the ground state
ρ meson and aV /aT = −(0.88± 0.18) for the ﬁrst excited
state. Here it is important to note that the ratio for the
ﬁrst excited state is negative2. The ratio aV /aT = 1.26
for the ground state ρ meson then means that the chiral
representation (0, 1) ⊕ (1, 0) is slightly favoured. For the
ﬁrst excited state with aV /aT = 0.88 the (1/2, 1/2)b rep-
resentation is slightly favoured.

Using now transformations (3),(4) we ﬁnd:
|ρ(770)(cid:105) = + (0.998 ± 0.002)|3S1(cid:105)

− (0.05 ± 0.025)|3D1(cid:105) ,

|ρ(1450)(cid:105) = − (0.106 ± 0.09 )|3S1(cid:105)
− (0.994 ± 0.005)|3D1(cid:105) .

(11)

(12)

The ground state ρ is therefore practically a pure 3S1
state, in agreement with the potential quark model as-
sumption.

The ﬁrst excited ρ is, however, a 3D1 state with a
very small admixture of a 3S1 wave. The latter result
is in clear contradiction with the potential constituent
quark model that attributes the ﬁrst excited state of the
ρ-meson as a radially excited 3S1 state.

2 We found an error in the data which led to the conclusions
in Refs. [5], [6]. Correcting this error gives the same result as
presented in Fig. 3.

We deﬁne the resolution scale as R = 2σa. The pro-
ﬁles are pictured in Figure 2. The Super Narrow source
probes the hadron wave function at the resolution ∼
0.25 fm and marks the ultraviolet end of our parameter
space. Narrow and Wide probe the hadron in the mid-
momentum region. The Ultra Wide source does not re-
solve details smaller than ∼ 0.9 fm and marks our in-
frared end. In this study it is not reasonable to go any
further in the infrared due to the box size of ∼ 2 fm.

Note that the gauge conﬁgurations remain untouched

throughout the whole process.

IV. RESULTS

As a consistency check we ﬁrst extract the masses of
the ρ states with our four source proﬁles and end up with
the same results as already found in Ref. [12]. Masses of
mesons, as expected, do not depend on the resolution
scale R and on a choice of a number of smearings used
in the eigenvalue problem (5).

becomes a pure (1/2, 1/2)b state. Already at k = 10
the states are strongly dominated by one chiral repres-
entation: the chiral representations, which are slightly
favored for k = 0, become dominant for k (cid:54)= 0.
After removal of ∼ 10− 20 lowest modes both ρ and ρ(cid:48)
get degenerate, which reﬂects a SU (4) symmetry [14, 15]
of QCD in Euclidean space-time [16]. For other recent
studies of this issue see Refs. [17, 18].

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we addressed the issue of the angular
momentum content of the leading quark-antiquark com-
ponent of ρ and ρ(1450).
In the potential constituent
quark model both states are assumed to be 3S1 state.

We investigated this issue via a lattice simulation with
dynamical Overlap fermions. We studied the ratio of
overlap factors of vector and pseudotensor interpolators
that belong to diﬀerent chiral representations. We ob-
served this ratio of overlap factors to be negative for the
ρ(1450), which implies that this state is a 3D1 state with
only a tiny 3S1 component. The ρ(770) is, in agreement
with the quark model, a 3S1 state.

Then we studied the eﬀect of removing the low-lying
Dirac eigenmodes on the ratio of overlap factors. The
state, which was identiﬁed as the ground state ρ at trun-
cation zero, becomes the (1, 0)⊕ (0, 1) state, while the ρ(cid:48)
meson becomes a pure (1/2, 1/2)b state. They are both
degenerate, which is a manifestation of the previously
found SU (4) symmetry.

tem at R = 0.89 fm and R = 0.245 fm. Here k = 0 corres-

V. EFFECT OF LOW-MODE TRUNCATION

ON THE OVERLAP FACTORS

We now study the eﬀect of removing the low-lying
modes of the Dirac operator on the ratio aV /aT .
Its
eﬀect on the hadron spectrum has been studied extens-
ively in Refs. [10]-[13]. The Banks-Casher relation con-
nects the low-lying modes of the Dirac operator to the
quark condensate. Hence by removing the lowest eigen-
modes we decouple our ρ states from the chiral sym-
metry breaking dynamics. The procedure of removing
the low modes from the quark propagator (D−1 denotes
the quark propagator) is given as:

In Fig. 4 we show the value aV /aT for the ground state
ρ and excited ρ(cid:48) at diﬀerent resolutions R for an increas-
ing number of removed modes. For k = 0, i.e. the full
theory, the mesons are a strong mixture of both chiral
representations. With an increasing number of modes
removed the ground state ρ meson approaches a pure
(0, 1) ⊕ (1, 0) state, whereas the ﬁrst excited state ρ(cid:48)
