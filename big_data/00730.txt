ABSTRACT

The Geminga pulsar, one of the brighest gamma-ray sources, is a promising candidate for emission of very-high-energy (VHE > 100
GeV) pulsed gamma rays. Also, detection of a large nebula have been claimed by water Cherenkov instruments. We performed deep
observations of Geminga with the MAGIC telescopes, yielding 63 hours of good-quality data, and searched for emission from the
pulsar and pulsar wind nebula. We did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant detection, and derived 95% conﬁdence level upper limits. The resulting
upper limits of 5.3 × 10−13 TeV cm−2 s−1 for the Geminga pulsar and 3.5 × 10−12 TeV cm−2 s−1 for the surrounding nebula at 50 GeV
are the most constraining ones obtained so far at VHE. To complement the VHE observations, we also analyzed 5 years of Fermi-LAT
data from Geminga, ﬁnding that the sub-exponential cut-oﬀ is preferred over the exponential cut-oﬀ that has been typically used in the
literature. We also ﬁnd that, above 10 GeV, the gamma-ray spectra from Geminga can be described with a power law with index softer
than 5. The extrapolation of the power-law Fermi-LAT pulsed spectra to VHE goes well below the MAGIC upper limits, indicating
that the detection of pulsed emission from Geminga with the current generation of Cherenkov telescopes is very diﬃcult.

1. Introduction
Geminga is the ﬁrst-known radio-quiet pulsar and the second
brightest persistent source in the GeV sky. A review on the his-
torical observations of Geminga can be found in Bignami &

as that of Crab and Vela, the short distance to this source makes
the spin-down ﬂux very large, which results in a high gamma-ray
ﬂux.

The mechanism of gamma-ray emission of pulsars is not yet
fully understood. Several emission locations were proposed as
the origin of high-energy photons. The polar cap (Sturrock 1971,
Harding et al. 1978, Daugherty & Harding 1982) region, located
close to the neutron star surface in the open magnetosphere, was
the ﬁrst to be proposed. However, a spectrum exhibiting a super-
exponential cut-oﬀ at a few GeV is expected from the polar-cap
gamma-ray emisson due to magnetic pair creation. The proposed
second region is the slot gap, located near the last open ﬁeld
line, which extends from the neutron star surface to the null sur-
face (Arons 1983, Dyks & Rudak 2003, Muslimov & Harding
2004). The third location of gamma-ray production proposed is
the outer gap (Cheng et al. 1986a, Cheng et al. 1986b, Romani
& Yadigaroglu 1995), which is located along the last open ﬁeld
line and extends from the null surface to the light cylinder. The
recent observations of the Crab pulsar at VHE by VERITAS and
MAGIC (Aliu et al. 2011a, Aleksi´c et al. 2011, Aleksi´c et al.
2012, Aleksi´c et al. 2014) require a new model to explain the
emission above 100 GeV and the recent observation of pulsed
emission above 400 GeV and extending beyond TeV energies,
as reported recently by MAGIC (Ahnen et al. 2015) challenges
even more the theoretical models. An extension of the outer-gap
model has been proposed (Lyutikov et al. 2012, Hirotani 2015) in
which the emission is explained by magnetospheric cascades in-
side the gap. Recently, synchroton self-Compton emission from
pairs was proposed to explain the emission from Crab, Vela and
millisecond pulsars (Harding & Kalapotharakos 2015). The pairs
are created above the polar cap and absorb radio photons increas-
ing their perpendicular momentum. Another emission region, lo-
cated at several light-cylinder radii, was investigated by Bogov-
alov & Aharonian 2000, Aharonian et al. 2012, where the pulsed
X-ray photons are inverse Compton up-scattered by a cold ultra-
relativistic pulsar-wind electrons.

Geminga was ﬁrst detected as an unidentiﬁed gamma-ray
source by the SAS-2 satellite (Fichtel et al. 1975). In 1977, the
COS B satellite (Hermsen et al. 1977) conﬁrmed a gamma-ray
emission from the same region. In 1983 an X-ray counterpart
of the COS B source was observed (Bignami et al. 1983) and
given the name Geminga, and in 1987 the optical counterpart
was detected (Bignami et al. 1987). The X-ray pulsation
was discovered by the ROSAT experiment (Halpern & Holt
1992), and was further observed in gamma ray by the EGRET
telescope (Bertsch et al. 1992) on board Compton Gamma-Ray
Observatory, and COS B (Bignami & Caraveo 1992). The
ﬁrst time-period derivative was estimated using COS B data
(Bignami & Caraveo 1992). In 1981, the spectrum of Geminga
was measured by the COS B satellite (Masnou et al. 1981),
being characterized by a simple power-law function from
100 MeV up to a few GeV. The power-law spectrum was
later conﬁrmed by EGRET (Mayer-Hasselwander et al. 1994)
with a harder index. The distance to the Geminga pulsar was
ﬁrst calculated by studying the interstellar absorption and
proper motion, and was estimated to be approximately 100 pc
(Bignami et al. 1983, Bignami et al. 1993). Deeper study of
the interstellar absorption, taking into account the spin-down
properties of the pulsar set limit to the distance of Geminga to
250+150−100 pc (Halpern & Ruderman 1993). Observations with the
Hubble Space Telescope of the annual paralax led to more strin-
gent constraint of the distance of 157+59−30 pc (Caraveo et al. 1996).

Event though the Geminga pulsar is radio quiet, several
investigations were carried out to look for radio emission. A
detection at 102.5 MHz was claimed in 1997 (Malofeev &
Malov 1997) with a ﬂux varying between 5 and 500 mJy. Strong

variations in the emission and pulse widths were reported too. A
soft spectrum would explain the absence of detection of pulsed
emission above 102 MHz. Recently, pulsed emission from the
Geminga pulsar was reported at 42, 62 and 111 MHz (Malov
et al. 2015). From these recent observations, the previous radio
silence from the Geminga pulsar has been interpreted as a
long-term variability of the radio emission with a period of
several years.

The Geminga pulsar, with one of the highest ﬂuxes de-
tected in the gamma-ray band (Acero et al. 2015) (4.5 ×
10−9 erg cm−2s−1 above 100 MeV) and a spectrum extend-
ing above 25 GeV, is a good candidate to be detected by
Cherenkov telescopes. The detection of the Geminga pulsar with
the MAGIC telescopes and the characterization of its timing and
spectral features can shed light on the emission location and
mechanisms at work in such an old pulsar.

One year of Fermi-LAT (Large Area telescope) (Atwood
et al. 2009) observations at high energies resulted in a power-law
spectrum with an exponential cut-oﬀ at (2.5 ± 0.2) GeV (Abdo
et al. 2010b). The study of the phase-resolved emission with ﬁne
binning shows a strong dependency of the cut-oﬀ energy on the
phase region considered. The pulsation is still clearly seen above
10 GeV with a reported signiﬁcance greater than 6 σ, using 3
years of data, and a hint was observed above 25 GeV (Acker-
mann et al. 2013).

The spectral shape and the presence of the pulsed emis-
sion above 25 GeV rules out the polar-cap model, in which a
super-exponential cut-oﬀ is expected at a few GeV. The Fermi-
LAT collaboration also reported that the peak intensity of P2
is getting stronger relative to the peak intensity of P1 above
200 MeV (Abdo et al. 2010b). Recently the VERITAS collab-
oration reported about the search for VHE emission from the
Geminga pulsar with no signal detected above 100 GeV (Aliu
et al. 2015). They computed upper limits of 4.0 × 10−13cm−2s−1
and 1.7 × 10−13cm−2s−1 on the integrated ﬂux above 135 GeV
for P1 and P2, respectively, using a spectral index of −3.8. The
second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT sources (2FHL) (Ackermann
et al. 2015), does not mention either the detection of Geminga
above 50 GeV.

Besides the emission from the pulsar, an X-ray nebula was
discovered around the Geminga pulsar (Caraveo et al. 2003)
showing the presence of an extended structure aligned with the
pulsar proper motion direction (Bignami et al. 1993). Observa-
tions with the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites (de Luca
et al. 2006; Pavlov et al. 2006) reported the detection of three
tail-like structures behind the pulsar; one 25” tail aligned to the
pulsar proper motion, and two 2’ outer tails. Another 50” emit-
ting region ahead of the pulsar was reported.

At gamma-ray energies, the Fermi-LAT reported a con-
tinuous emission over the whole pulsar rotation, but
is
incompatible with a surrounding nebula (Abdo et al. 2010b).
The Whipple collaboration obtained an integral ﬂux upper limit
for continuous emission of 8.8 × 10−12 cm−2 s−1 above 0.5 TeV
(Akerlof et al. 1993). At higher energies, the Milagro collabora-
tion reported the detection of a TeV extended steady emission
from Geminga at a signiﬁcance of 6.3 σ, recently conﬁrmed by
HAWC (Baughman et al. 2015). Milagro observed an emission
region that is extended by 2-3 degrees and reported a ﬂux level
of (38 ± 11) × 10−17 TeV−1 cm−2 s−1 at 35 TeV (Abdo et al.
2009). At radio frequencies, many observers have attempted to
detect a continuous emission from Geminga. Only the deepest
VLA interferometric observation of Geminga performed in
2004 (Giacani et al. 2005), resulted in the detection of steady

radio emission. Overall, the Geminga radio tail is compatible
with the scenario of a synchrotron-emitting PWN.

In order to study the gamma-ray emission of the Geminga
pulsar and nebula, we collected 75 hours of observation with
MAGIC. Furthermore, we performed the analysis of 5 years of
Fermi-LAT data in order to complement the VHE observations.

pulsar was produced. The signiﬁcance in each bin of the sky
map was computed using the Li & Ma method applied on a
background estimate. The cuts were selected maximizing the
Q-factor on a contemporaneous Crab Nebula sample using the
hadronness and size parameters of the images, which is deﬁned
as the sum of the charge from each pixel. The upper limits for
the nebula emission were computed using the same method as
for the pulsed emission and diﬀerent spectral assumption.

2. MAGIC observations and data analysis
The MAGIC telescopes are a set of two imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescopes. They are located at a height of 2200 m
a.s.l. in the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory, on La Palma
island (Spain). Both telescopes consist of a 17 m diameter reﬂec-
tor and a fast imaging camera with a ﬁeld of view of 3.5◦ diame-
ter. The trigger threshold for standard observations at zenith an-
gles below 35◦ is around 50 GeV. The MAGIC telescopes have
an integral sensitivity of 0.66% of the Crab Nebula ﬂux above
220 GeV for 50 hours of observation, with an angular resolu-
tion of ∼ 0.07◦ and an energy resolution of 16% (Aleksi´c et al.
2016b).

Observations of the Geminga pulsar and nebula were per-
formed between December 2012 and March 2013, with the up-
graded MAGIC telescopes (Aleksi´c et al. 2016a). During this
period, a total of ∼ 75 hours were taken at zenith angles below
35◦ to ensure the lowest possible energy threshold. The obser-
vations were performed in the so-called wobble mode (Fomin
et al. 1994), where the source is oﬀset by 0.4◦ from the camera
center. After rejection of data taken under unfavorable weather
or technical conditions, 63 hours of data remained for the anal-
ysis. Together with each event image, we recorded the absolute
event arrival time using a GPS receiver. The performance of the
MAGIC time acquisition system was evaluated by observing pe-
riodically the Crab pulsar in the optical wave band with a spe-
cial PMT located at the MAGIC camera center (Lucarelli et al.
2008).
The data analysis was performed using the standard MAGIC
analysis chain MARS (Zanin et al. 2013). The phase of the events
was computed using tempo2 (Hobbs et al. 2006). The ephemeris
was provided by the Fermi-LAT collaboration1 (Ray et al. 2011).
For the pulsar analysis, gamma-ray candidate events are selected
by applying cuts in hadronness and in θ2. Hadroness is a particle-
identiﬁcation estimator that classiﬁes events into gamma-ray or
hadron candidates, while θ2 is the squared angular distance be-
tween the source position and the re-constructed source position.
The cuts are optimized using a background sample and Monte
Carlo gamma-ray sample by maximizing in each energy bin the
Q-factor deﬁned as: Q = εon/
εo f f , where εon and εo f f are the
eﬃciency of the cuts for signal and background data, respec-
tively. For the computation of the cuts we imposed that at least
50% of the Monte Carlo gamma-ray events survive the cuts. The
signiﬁcance of the pulsed emission was estimated using equation
17 in Li & Ma (1983). The upper limits on the pulsed emission
were computed using the Rolke method (Rolke & López 2001)
assuming a Poissonian background and requiring a 95% conﬁ-
dence level.

√

The search for a steady extended emission was done comput-
ing the signal to noise ratio around the Geminga pulsar. Several
extensions around the Geminga pulsar were considered, setting
diﬀerent value of the cut in θ2 (0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1 deg2).
Also, a signiﬁcance sky map of the region around the Geminga

3. Fermi-LAT observation
3.1. Fermi data analysis
A data sample of 5 years (from 54710 up to 56587 MJD) of
Fermi-LAT data was analyzed. We analyzed this data-set us-
ing the P7REP_SOURCE_V15 instrument response functions
and the Fermi tools version v9r31p1. We selected events that
were recorded when the telescope was in nominal science mode
and when the rocking angle was lower than 52◦. To reject the
background coming from the Earth’s limb, we selected photons
with a zenith angle ≤ 100◦. The phase and barycentric cor-
rections of the events were computed using tempo2 using the
same ephemeris as for MAGIC data. We computed the light
curve and the spectral energy distribution for both peaks, P1 and
P2, separately. Furthermore, we calculated the phase averaged
(PA) emission. The pulsar light curve was produced using an en-
ergy dependent region of interest (ROI) with a radius deﬁned as
R = max(6.68−1.76×log(E), 1.3)◦ as done in Abdo et al. 2010a.
For the spectral analysis, the binned likelihood method was
used. We set the ROI to 15◦ as done in Abdo et al. 2013. We
included all the sources from the third Fermi catalog (Acero et al.
2015) in the background model. For sources with a signiﬁcance
higher than 5 σ and located at less than 10 degrees away from
the Geminga pulsar, only the normalization factor was left free.
We also let the normalization factor of the isotropic and Galactic
background models free. We discarded all the sources with TS <
2. For all the remaining sources all the parameters were ﬁxed to
the catalog values. For the calculation of the spectral points, we
repeated the procedure in each energy bin using a power law with
the spectral index and normalization factor free. Only spectral
points with a signiﬁcance higher than 2 σ are shown on the plots.

3.2. Fermi-LAT results
We computed the light curve above 100 MeV. To determine the
pulses proﬁles and OFF phase range we used photons with en-
ergy larger than 5 GeV for P1 and larger than 10 GeV for P2. The
two diﬀerent energy ranges are motivated by the aim of evalu-
ating the peak shape at the largest energy, for a better matching
with the one we would expect at the MAGIC energy range, main-
taining enough statistics. We ﬁt both peaks to asymmetric Gaus-
sian functions. We used as signal region the peak position ±1σ,
as shown in Table 1. We deﬁned the background region in the
oﬀ-phase where no emission is expected from the pulsar. From
now on P1 and P2 will always be referred as the values in Table
1. The obtained light curve above 100 MeV together with the
signal and background regions are shown in Figure 1 together
with a close-up on the ﬁts of P1 and P2 at the corresponding en-
ergies.

We ﬁt the spectral energy distribution (SED) of P1, P2 and
the phase-averaged (PA) using two diﬀerent spectral shapes:
power-law with an exponential cut-oﬀ function (EC), and power-
law with a sub-exponential cut-oﬀ function (SEC). The sub-

the likelihood ratio of the SEC model over EC results in a de-
viation for the SEC of 6 σ, 11 σ and 24 σ for P1, P2 and PA,
respectively. We also computed the SED using ﬁner binning in
order to estimate the evolution of the b parameter according to
the phase width considered. The top and bottom panels in Fig-

In order to characterize the emission at high energies, we ﬁt

The results of the power-law ﬁt above 10 GeV are shown in Table

The resulting spectra computed using 5 years of Fermi-LAT
data are consistent with the previous results reported by the

4. MAGIC Results
We computed the light curve and the corresponding signiﬁcances
for the pulsed emission in three energy ranges: above 50 GeV,
50–100 GeV and 100–200 GeV, as shown in Figure 3. The back-
ground is estimated from the oﬀ-pulse region (grey area; phase
0.70 – 0.95) and the dashed red line represents the averaged num-
ber of events in the background region We computed the signif-
icance for P1, P2, and the sum of both peaks. The results of the
statistical tests are shown in Table 4. No signiﬁcant pulsation
was found in MAGIC data in any of the energy ranges inves-
tigated. We computed the upper limits for the pulsed emission.
The spectral indices used for the upper limits computation were
obtained from the extrapolation of P1 and P2 Fermi-LAT spectra
above 10 GeV using a powe law (see Table 3).

The diﬀerential upper limits computed for the pulsed emis-
sion are shown in Figure 4 by the black arrows. The black lines
on top of the arrows have the spectral slope used for the upper

Figure 5 shows the sky map of the signal signiﬁcance around
the Geminga pulsar for the steady emission using MAGIC data.
The position of the Geminga pulsar is marked with a cross. The
white circle represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian
function used for the smearing of the sky map. No signiﬁcant
emission was found from the Geminga nebula above 50 GeV.
We calculated the diﬀerential upper limits on the emission from
the nebula surrounding the Geminga pulsar in the energy range
covered by MAGIC. The computed diﬀerential upper limits are
represented by the black arrows in Figure 6. The spectral index
used for the upper limit computation was taken as −2.6. In order
to estimate the upper limit variations due to the assumption of the
spectral index value, we recomputed the upper limits assuming
two diﬀerent spectral indices of −2.0 and −2.8. The two cho-
sen values deﬁne the typical range of spectral indexes for pulsar
wind nebulae (Strakovsky & Blokhintsev 2013). A ﬂuctuation of
13% is observed in the upper limit computation below 120 GeV.
For energies above 120 GeV the variations are below 10%. We
also estimated the integral upper limits on the emission from the
nebula to be 2.4 × 10−11cm−2s−1 and 3.2 × 10−12cm−2s−1 above
50 GeV and 200 GeV, respectively. In Figure 6, the computed

5. Discussion and conclusions
During the winter 2012/13, the Geminga pulsar and its surround-
ing nebula were observed for 63 good-quality-selected hours by
the MAGIC telescopes to search for emission from the pulsar
and its surrounding nebula at VHE. The analysis of the MAGIC
data yielded no signiﬁcant signal and hence resulted the compu-
tation of upper limits above 50 GeV for both pulsed and steady
emission. Besides MAGIC data, 5 years of Fermi-LAT data were
analyzed to derive pulsed and phase-averaged emission and com-
pare to the VHE upper limits. Our results on the analysis of
MAGIC and Fermi-LAT data are consistent with those reported
in the 2FHL, where no signiﬁcant signal from Geminga was
found above 50 GeV. In addition, the computed integral upper
limit on the emission from the nebula above 200 GeV is compat-
ible with the ﬂux level reported by Milagro.

The Fermi-LAT spectra from 0.1 GeV to 30 GeV can be
described by a power-law with a sub-exponential cut-oﬀ. As
reported by (Lyutikov 2012), a simple power-law can also be
used to characterize the emission at the high energies, and more
statistics would be required to distinguish between the spectral
shapes. The upper limits computed using the MAGIC data are
well above the Fermi-LAT power-law spectra extrapolated to
VHE, and hence they do not provide additional constrains to
the spectral shape of the pulsed emission. Therefore, the mecha-
nism responsible for the high-energy emission from the Geminga
pulsar is diﬃcult to establish. At high energies, the emission
due to synchro-curvature radiation and inverse Compton scatter-
ing are expected to exhibit diﬀerent spectral shapes. For exam-
ple, in the framework of the outer-gap model, where the high-
energy emission takes place at high altitudes from the neutron
star (Cheng et al. 1986a, Cheng et al. 1986b), a curvature or
synchro-curvature radiation mechanism would exhibit a spec-
tral shape well characterized by an exponential cut-oﬀ (Prosekin

Article number, page 6 of 8

et al. 2013, Viganò & Torres 2015). As the radiation is very sen-
sitive to the pitch angle of the radiating particles, the sum of the
emission from particles with the same energy but diﬀerent an-
gles results in a less abrupt cut-oﬀ. Furthermore, calculations of
the outer-gap magnetic-ﬁeld-aligned electric ﬁeld evolution (Hi-
rotani 2006, Hirotani 2015) show that the accelerating electric
ﬁeld depends on the height in the gap and reaches a maximum
in the center of the gap. Distinct heights with diﬀerent values of
the electric ﬁeld would accelerate particles at diﬀerent energies,
resulting in a spread of the cut-oﬀ energy values. A strong de-
pendency of the cut-oﬀ energy on the accelerating electric ﬁeld
is reported by (Viganò et al. 2015). Such a behavior of the cut-oﬀ
values was reported for the Geminga pulsar (Abdo et al. 2010b).
The Fermi collaboration studied the phase-resolved evolution of
the cut-oﬀ energy for the Geminga pulsar over the whole pulsar
rotation using bin sizes such as each bin contains 2000 photons.
The results show that within the P1 and P2 phase regions, where
the computed cut-oﬀ values are the highest, these values vary.
Considering wider phase ranges, the ﬂuctuations of the cut-oﬀ
value would result in an a sub-exponential cut-oﬀ spectral shape.
However, the pulsed gamma-ray spectra we computed using ﬁne
bins in phase around the pulses’ positions discard the exponen-
tial cut-oﬀ because the best ﬁt values for the b parameter are
signiﬁcantly smaller than 1. In the case of synchro-curvature ra-
diation, this deviation can arise from the caustic emission (Dyks
& Rudak 2003), i.e, overlapping of photons emitted at diﬀerent
heights and along diﬀerent magnetic ﬁeld lines. The caustic ef-
fect being more important for P2 than P1, due to the curvature
of the magnetic ﬁeld line, would explain the greater values of b
for P1 with respect to P2.

In the case of an inverse Compton (IC) emission or synchro-
ton self-Compton within the outer gap (Hirotani 2015), the break
in the spectral shape would correspond to a break in the particle
distribution function (Lyutikov 2012) if all the emission comes
from this mechanism. If the particles are distributed as a bro-
ken power law, then the IC spectrum would appear as a broken
power law too, and a high-energy power-law like tail would be
seen as it is the case for the Crab pulsar (Aliu et al. 2011b, Alek-
si´c et al. 2011, Aleksi´c et al. 2012, Aleksi´c et al. 2014, Ahnen
et al. 2015). However, in the case of an inverse Compton emis-
sion, the power-law tail exhibited by the Geminga pulsar would
be much softer than that of the Crab (Aleksi´c et al. 2014), as can
be seen from the power-law spectral ﬁt of the Fermi-LAT data
above 10 GeV. A hard gamma-ray tail is not expected even if the
curvature radiation is produced in a curved magnetic ﬁeld close
to the light cylinder (Bednarek 2012).
The analysis of the nebula around the Geminga pulsar shows no
signiﬁcant detection above 50 GeV. The presence of the neb-
ula is unknown at the GeV scale. Indeed, the observations of
the Geminga pulsar with the Fermi-LAT show no evidence of a
surrounding nebula. The detection of a large nebula similar to
the one claimed by the Milagro Collaboration is not straight-
forward for MAGIC, as its extension is larger than the ﬁeld
of view of the telescopes. Overall, the prospects of detecting
the Geminga pulsar with the current Cherenkov telescopes are
rather low. However, the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array
(CTA)(Bernlöhr et al. 2013) could, with a better sensitivity and a
lower energy threshold, detect high energy gamma-ray emission
from the Geminga pulsar and thus shed light on the physics of
pulsars. We have estimated that Geminga could be detected at a
5 σ level by CTA in 50 hours.
