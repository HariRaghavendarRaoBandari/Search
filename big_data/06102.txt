ON THE TYPE IIB SOLUTIONS TO MEAN CURVATURE FLOW

FOR ENTIRE GRAPHS

Abstract. We prove in this paper that the mean curvature ﬂow for entire
graphs satisfying certain conditions could be Type IIb, i.e. the solution
t|A|2 = ∞, where A(·, t) is the
exists for all t ≥ 0 and satisﬁes
second fundamental form. Our results lead us to getting the nontrivial
examples for the Type IIb mean curvature ﬂow. Precisely as an applica-
tion to our results we obtain that the mean curvature ﬂow for the graph
(y, |y|α) over Rn is Type IIb, where n ≥ 2 and α > 1. In order to prove the
main theorems, we extend Andrews’ noncollapsing theorem to noncom-
pact case.

mean curvature ﬂow

Let x0 : Mn → Rn+1 be a complete immersed hypersurface. Consider the
(1.1)
with the initial data x0, where ~H = −Hν is the mean curvature vector and ν
is the outer unit normal vector. Denote the images x(Mn, t) = Mt. If M0 can
be written as an entire graph; i.e. there exists a vector ω0 ∈ Rn+1, |ω0| = 1,
such that for a choice of unit normal vector ν for M0 we have hν, ω0i > 0
everywhere on M0, then the parabolic system (1.1) up to tangential diﬀeo-
morphisms is equivalent to the following quasilinear equation

Note that Type IIb and Type III mean curvature ﬂows only appear on the
noncompact hypersurfaces since the mean curvature ﬂow always blows up
at ﬁnite time on closed hypersurfaces. Recall the singularity formation of
the mean curvature ﬂow on closed hypersurfaces at the ﬁrst singular time
was described by Huisken [11] as follows: The solution to mean curvature
ﬂow Mt on closed hypersurfaces which blows up at ﬁrst ﬁnite time T is

one can classify the longtime solutions to the mean curvature ﬂow into the

For each rescaled ﬂow (1.4), 0 ∈ M j

1 at t = 0. By employing a Harnack inequality, Hamilton [15] showed that
any strictly convex eternal solution to the mean curvature ﬂow where the
mean curvature assumes its maximum value at a point in space-time must
be a translating soliton. Huisken and Sinestrari ([12] [13]) proved blowup
sequence of the compact mean curvature ﬂow with positive mean curvature
subconverges to a weakly convex limit splitting as Rn−k × Σk, where Σk is
strictly convex. Their results implies that rescaled sequence (1.4) subcon-
verges to a translating soliton if M0 is mean convex.

Similar to the Type II mean curvature ﬂow, if Mt is the Type IIb mean
curvature ﬂow, as which was introduced by Hamilton [16] for Ricci ﬂow,
one can choose j → +∞, and pick P j and t j such that

Sesum [6] also introduced monotonicity formulas related to self-expanders
and showed the normalized mean curvature ﬂow (1.8) subconverges to the
self-expander under certain conditions.

Typical examples of Type III mean curvature ﬂow are evolving entire
graphs satisfying the linear growth condition, or equivalently the entire
graphs having the bounded gradient, which in particular implies

υ := hν, ω0i−1 ≤ c,

(1.9)

4

LIANG CHENG

where ν is the unit outer normal vector of the graph and ω0 is a ﬁxed unit
vector such that hν, ω0i > 0. Ecker and Huisken showed that the mean
curvature ﬂow on entire graphs satisfying the linear growth condition is
Type III (see Corollary 4.4 in [9]). They also proved that if the entire graph
satisﬁes the linear growth condition (1.9) and in addition the estimate

hx0, νi2 ≤ c(1 + |x0|2)1−δ

(1.10)
at time t = 0, where c < ∞ and δ > 0, then the solution to the normalized
mean curvature ﬂow (1.8) with initial data x0 converges as s → ∞ to a
self-expander.
Contrast to Ecker and Huisken’s result, we prove in this paper that the
mean curvature ﬂow for entire graphs satisfying certain conditions could be
Type IIb. Note that the non-ﬂat translating solitons are trivial examples for
Type IIb mean curvature ﬂow. Our results lead us to getting the nontrivial
examples for the Type IIb mean curvature ﬂow.

The ﬁrst theorem of the paper is following

Theorem 1.2. Let Mt be a solution to the mean curvature ﬂow for immersed
noncompact hypersurface in Rn+1 with bounded fundamental form at each
time slice. Suppose that there exist a ﬁxed vector ω and constants C1, C2
such that

C1H ≤ W ≤ C2H,

(1.11)
at t = 0, where W = hν, ωi, and M0 is contained in the half-plane Rn+1
with its boundary ∂Rn+1
not parallel to ω. Then the mean curvature ﬂow
Mt can not be Type III. In addition, if M0 is an entire graph, then the mean
curvature ﬂow Mt must be Type IIb.

+

+

We can use Theorem 1.2 to show that the mean curvature ﬂow for the
graph (y, |y|α) over Rn, n ≥ 2, for the case α ≥ 2 must be Type IIb (see
Corollary 2.3). Notice that the graph (y, |y|α) for 0 < α ≤ 1 satisfying the
linear growth condition (1.9), so the mean curvature ﬂow for such graph is
Type III by Ecker and Huisken’s result [9]. It remains to determine the Type
of mean curvature ﬂow for graph (y, |y|α) for the case 1 < α < 2.
The next theorem of this paper implies the mean curvature ﬂow for the
graph (y, |y|α) over Rn, n ≥ 2, for the case α > 1 must be Type IIb. Before
presenting the second theorem of this paper, we recall the deﬁnition of δ-
Andrews’ noncollapsing condition.
Deﬁnition 1.3. [1][8] (δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition) If M is a smooth,
complete, mean convex embedded hypersurface (possibly noncompact) with
M = ∂K, then M satisﬁes the δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition for δ > 0
if for every p ∈ M there are closed balls ¯BInt ⊆ K and ¯BExt ⊆ Rn+1\Int(K) of
radius at least
H(p) that are tangent to M at p from the interior and exterior
of M respectively.

The second theorem of this paper is the following

Theorem 1.4. Let Mt, t ∈ [0, T ), be the solution to the mean convex mean
curvature ﬂow for the embedded complete noncompact hypersurface in Rn+1
with bounded fundamental form at each time slice. Suppose that there exist
a ﬁxed vector ω and positive constants ǫ, C such that

|W| ≤ C(1 + |x|2) 1−ǫ

(1.12)
at t = 0, where W = hν, ωi, and M0 satisﬁes the δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing
condition and is contained in the half-plane Rn+1
+ with its boundary ∂Rn+1
not parallel to ω. Then the mean curvature ﬂow Mt can not be Type III. In
addition, if M0 is an entire graph, then the mean curvature ﬂow Mt must be
Type IIb.

2 H,

+

Remark 1.5. (1) Since δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition is needed in
Theorem 1.4, Theorem 1.4 can not cover Theorem 1.2. For example, the
grim reaper satisﬁes the conditions of Theorem 1.2 but Theorem 1.4.

(2)A key step in the proof of Theorem 1.4 is to prove if M0 satisﬁes the

δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition, then the following estimate

|∇lA| ≤ CHl+1,

(1.13)
holds under the mean curvature ﬂow for all t > 0 and any integer l (Corol-
lary 3.4). The estimate (1.13) was obtained by Huisken and Sinestrari [14]
for compact mean convex mean curvature ﬂow. Then Haslhofer and Kleiner
[8] gave a another proof for the estimate (1.13) for the compact case by us-
ing Andrews’ noncollapsing theorem [1]. After extending Andrews’ non-
collapsing theorem to the noncompact case (Theorem 3.2), a local estimate
by Haslhofer and Kleiner [8] implies the estimate (1.13).

Finally, we get the following Theorem about the mean curvature ﬂow for

the mean curvature ﬂow for graph (y, |y|α) over Rn, n ≥ 2 and α > 0.
Theorem 1.6. Let Mt be the solution to mean curvature ﬂow with initial
data M0 is the graph (y, |y|α) over Rn, α > 0 and n ≥ 2. If α > 2, then the
|A|(p, t) → +∞ as t → +∞ for any p ∈ Mn. If α < 2, then |A|(p, t) → 0 as
t → +∞ for any p ∈ M. If α = 2, then 0 < cp ≤ |A|(p, t) ≤ 2n2, where cp is
positive constant independent of t.

Applying Ecker and Huisken’s result in [10] to the case 0 < α ≤ 1 and
summarizing the results in this paper about the mean curvature ﬂow for the
(y, |y|α) over Rn, α > 0 and n ≥ 2, we have the following table.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we give proofs
of Theorem 1.2 and its application Corollary 2.3. In section 3, we extend
Andrews’ noncollapsing theorem to noncompact case and get the estimate
(1.13). In section 4 we give proofs of Theorem 1.4 and its application Corol-
lary 4.1. In section 5 we give the proof of Theorem 1.6.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.2 and its application

Before presenting the proof of Theorem 1.2 we need prove the following

two lemmas.
Lemma 2.1. Deﬁne W = hν, ωi, where ω is a ﬁxed vector. Under the mean
curvature ﬂow , we have

Proof. By Lemma 3.3 in [11], we have

ν = ∇H.

Moreover,

∆W = eih∇eiν, ωi = eihhilel, ωi = h∇H, ωi − |A|2W.

(2.2)

Then Theorem 2.1 follows from (2.1) and (2.2).
Lemma 2.2. Let Mt be a solution to the mean curvature ﬂow with bounded
second fundamental form at each time slice. Deﬁne W = hν, ωi, where ω is
some ﬁxed vector. If H ≥ CW or H ≤ CW for some constant C at t = 0,
then it remains so under the mean curvature ﬂow .
Proof. By Lemma 2.1, we have

(cid:3)

(

∂

∂t − ∆)(H − CW) = |A|2(H − CW).

By the maximum principle, H − CW ≥ 0 or H − CW ≤ 0 is preserved under
the mean curvature ﬂow .

(cid:3)

Now we give the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. We argue by contradiction. Assume that Mt =
t|A|2 =
x(Mn, t) is the Type III solution to the mean curvature ﬂow with sup
C < ∞ and ex(·, s) be its corresponding normalized mean curvature ﬂow

Ecker and Huisken [10]. It follows that there exists a sequence si → +∞

3. Ben Andrews’ noncollapsing for mean convex noncompact

hypersurfaces

In [1] Andrews found a short quantitative argument that the mean convex
mean curvature ﬂow satisﬁes δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition for all

ON THE TYPE IIB SOLUTIONS TO MEAN CURVATURE FLOW FOR ENTIRE GRAPHS 9

time. In this section we extend Andrews’ arguments to noncompact case.
We ﬁrst need the following barrier function in following Lemma.

Lemma 3.1 (Lemma 12.30 in [3]). Let (Mn, g) be a complete noncompact
Riemannian manifold with bounded sectional curvature |Rm| ≤ k0 for some
k0 ≥ 0. Then there exists constant D = D(n, k0) > 0 such that for any
O ∈ Mn there exists a C∞ function h : Mn → R satisfying
D−1(dg(O, x) + 1) ≤ h(x) ≤ D(dg(O, x) + 1)

and

on Mn.

|∇gh| ≤ D, ∇g∇gh ≤ D,

Theorem 3.2. Let Mt be a solution to the mean curvature ﬂow for mean
convex complete noncompact embedded hypersurface in Rn+1 with bounded
second fundamental form at each time slice. If M0 satisﬁes the δ-Andrews’
noncollapsing condition, then it remains so under the mean curvature ﬂow.

Proof. We follow the Andrews’ calculation in [1]. Denote

Z(x, y, t) =

H(x)
2 ||X(y, t) − X(x, t)||2 + δhX(y, t) − X(x, t), ν(x)i.

(3.1)

We will prove that if Z ≥ 0 at t = 0 then Z ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0 for any
constant δ, as showed in [1], that implies Theorem 3.2. Write d(x, y, t) =
||X(y, t)− X(x, t)||2, η(x, y, t) =

at x and y. By the equations (1) and (2) in [1],

Assume that second fundamental form for Mt is bounded by C0 on [0, T ].
Then |∇mA| ≤ Cm on [0, T ] by the standard estimates by Ecker and Huisken
[10]. By Lemma 3.1 and direct calculations, we get for h which is the
function deﬁned in Lemma 3.1

ξ(y, t) with ξ(x, t) = e(B+nD′+D′2)t+h(x) and ξ(y, t) = e(B+nD′+D′2)t+h(y), where B is

Since the mean curvature is strictly positive on [0, t0] and by (3.14), we have

Recall Haslhofer and Kleiner [8] proved the following local estimate.

Theorem 3.3. [8] For any δ > 0 there exist ρ(δ) > 0 and Cl(δ) < +∞ such
that if Mt satisﬁes δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition in the parabolic ball
P(x, t, r) = B(x, r) × (t − r2, t] with H(p, t) ≤ r−1 then
P(x,t,ρr)|∇lA| ≤ Cl(δ)r−(l+1).

(3.20)

As the corollary of Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 3.3, we have the following

ON THE TYPE IIB SOLUTIONS TO MEAN CURVATURE FLOW FOR ENTIRE GRAPHS13

Corollary 3.4. Let Mt be the mean curvature ﬂow for mean convex com-
plete noncompact embedded hypersurface in Rn+1 with bounded curvature
at each time slice. If M0 satisﬁes the δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition,
then |∇lA|Hl+1 ≤ Cl(δ) for any t ∈ (0, T ).
Proof. By Theorem 3.2, Mt satisﬁes the δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condi-
tion for all t ≥ 0. Then Corollary 3.4 follows from Theorem 3.3 directly. (cid:3)

4. Proof of Theorem 1.4 and its application

Proof of Theorem 1.4. We follow an idea of Ecker and Huisken in [9].
Assume that Mt = x(Mn, t) be the Type III solution to the mean curvature
ﬂow with

t|A|2 = C < ∞ and ex(·, s) be its corresponding normal-
ized mean curvature ﬂow (1.8). Denote ˜Ms = ex(Mn, s). By (1.7), we have

Moreover, ˜H is uniformly bounded by the Type III condition, hence ˜W → 0

proof of Theorem 1.2 to get a contradiction. (cid:3)
Corollary 4.1. Let (y, u(|y|)) be the smooth convex entire graph over Rn,
n ≥ 2, satisfying δ-Andrews’ noncollapsing condition. Suppose that there
exist positive constants ǫ0, c and N such that for r ≥ N

u′(r) ≥ crǫ0.

(4.6)

Then the mean curvature ﬂow with initial data (y, u(|y|)) must be Type IIb.
Moreover, we have the mean curvature ﬂow for graph (y, |y|α) over Rn, α > 1
and n ≥ 2, must be Type IIb.
Proof. We choose ω = −en+1. Deﬁne r = |y|. Since (y, u(|y|)) is convex,
u′′(r) > 0 and u′(r) > 0. By (2.9) and (2.10), taking ǫ = ǫ0

for r ≥ N. If the graph (y, u(|y|)) is smooth and covex, then H and W are
positive and continuous. Then (1.12) is satisﬁed for r ≤ N. Hence the mean
curvature ﬂow for the graph (y, u(|y|)) over Rn, n ≥ 2, satisfying (4.6) must
be Type IIb by Theorem 1.4. For the case the entire graph is (y, |y|α) over Rn,
n ≥ 2 and α > 1, it is straightforward to check the conditions of Theorem
1.4 are satisﬁed.

(cid:3)

5. Proof of Theorem 1.6

Proof of Theorem 1.4. In [7] Altschuler, Steven J., L. F. Wu proved that
there exists rotational symmetric convex translating graph X0 = (y, gN(|y|))
satisfying

~H = V⊥.

g′N (r)
r = N, and hence it is ”asymptotic to” parabo-
with V = Nen+1 and lim
r→+∞
loid as r → +∞. The solution to mean curvature ﬂow with initial data X0 is
translating as Xt(φ∗t (p), t) = X0(p) + Nen+1t.
If α > 2, then for any large N there exists positive constant CN such that
|y|α + CN > gN(|y|). It implies that M0 + CNen+1 is above X0. Now we argue
by contradiction. Assume that there exists p ∈ Mn such that |A|(p, t) ≤ Cp.
By (1.1),

|(x(p, t) + CNen+1) − (x(p, 0) + CNen+1)| ≤ Cpt.

That implies

B(x(p, 0) + CNen+1, Cpt) ∩ (Mt + CNen+1) , ∅.

However, taking N = 2Cp, Xt is translating in the en+1 direction with veloc-
ity 2Cp which implies that B(x(p, 0) + CNen+1, Cpt) will stand below Xt for
t suﬃcient large. But Mt + CNen+1 is above Xt for all t ≥ 0 and hence

B(x(p, 0) + CNen+1, Cpt) ∩ Mt = ∅
for t suﬃcient large. Then we obtain a contradiction.

If α = 2, by (2.9) and (2.10), a direct calculation shows that 0 < H ≤
2nW at t = 0. It follows from Lemma 2.1 that 0 < H ≤ 2nW for t ≥ 0. By
the convexity, |A| ≤ nH ≤ 2n2W ≤ 2n2. We use the contradictory arguments
to get the lower bound for |A|(p, t). Assume that there exists p ∈ Mn such
that |A|(p, t) → 0. By (1.1), we have for any small ǫ > 0
(5.1)
Taking N = 1, there exists positive constant C1 such that |y|2 + C1 > g1(|y|).
Hence M0 + C1en+1 is above X0. Notice that Xt is translating in the en+1
direction with velocity 1 which implies that B(x(p, 0)+C1en+1, ǫt) will stand
below Xt for ǫ < 1 and t suﬃcient large. But Mt + C1en+1 is above Xt for all
t ≥ 0 and hence

|x(p, t) − x(p, 0)| ≤ ǫt.

B(x(p, 0) + C1en+1, ǫt) ∩ (Mt + C1en+1) = ∅
for ǫ < 1 and t suﬃcient large, which contradicts to (5.1).

Finally we consider the case 1 < α < 2. Since Mt is rotational symmetric
and convex for any t ≥ 0, for any t there exists a point qt ∈ Mt achieves the
unique minimum of the graph function for Mt. Moreover, qt always stays
on the xn+1-axis, otherwise by the symmetry there would have more than
one minimum point on Mt. Denote x(p0, 0) = q0 for some p ∈ Mn. Since

ON THE TYPE IIB SOLUTIONS TO MEAN CURVATURE FLOW FOR ENTIRE GRAPHS17

the unit normal vectors at qt are −en+1, we have x(p0, t) = qt by (1.1) for all
t ≥ 0. Hence ν(p0, t) = −en+1 for any t ≥ 0. If H(p0, t) ≥ c > 0, then by
(1.1)

|x(p0, t) − x(p0, 0)| ≥ ct.

Since for any small ǫ > 0, there exists positive constant CN such that gǫ(|y|)+
CN ≥ |y|α. Hence for any small ǫ > 0 we have X0 + CNen+1 is above M0.
Note that Xt is translating in the en+1 direction with velocity ǫ and Mt is
always below Xt + CNen+1 for all t ≥ 0 and hence

|x(p0, t) − x(p0, 0)| ≤ ǫt + CN.

Then we obtain a contradiction when ǫ < 1 and t is suﬃcient large. Hence
H(p0, t) → 0 as t → +∞. It follows from |∇H|H2 ≤ C1(δ) and the convexity
that H(p, t) → 0 as t → +∞ for any p ∈ Mn. By the convexity, we conclude
that |A(p, t)| → 0 as t → +∞ for any p ∈ Mn. (cid:3)

6. appendix

In this section we prove that the limit of rescaled sequence (1.7) for con-
vex Type III mean curvature ﬂow is self-expander (Corollary 6.3). Similar
results had been obtained by Hamilton [16] [15] for Type II Ricci ﬂow and
mean curvature ﬂow and Chen and Zhu [4] for Type III Ricci ﬂow. One can
use the similar arguments to prove Corollary 6.3. We give a proof for sake
of convenience for the readers.

First we recall Hamilton’s Harnack inequality for the mean curvature

ﬂow.

where ˜Z = 0 in the V = 0 direction. Then the strong maximum principle
implies that there exists vector V at each point such that ˜Z = 0. Moreover,
the zero factor V is obtained from the ﬁrst variation of ˜Z by Va = −h−1
ab∇bH.
Now ﬁx Va = −h−1

Finally, we give the proof of Corollary 6.3.

Corollary 6.3. Let Mt be the Type III convex mean curvature ﬂow for the
noncompact hypersurface with bounded second fundamental form at each
time slice. Then the limit obtained as (1.7) is a non-ﬂat self-expander split-
ting as Rn−k × Σk, where Σk is strictly convex.
Remark 6.4. Due to a counter-example in [6], Corollary 6.3 is not true if we
only assume the Type III mean curvature ﬂow is mean convex.
Proof. By Hamilton’s Harnack (6.1), we have √tH is pointwisely mono-
tone nonincreasing. Taking ˜xi(s) = ˜x(s + si), where ˜x is deﬁned in (1.7) and
si → +∞. We take the limit as the way in the proof of Theorem 1.2. Let p ∈
