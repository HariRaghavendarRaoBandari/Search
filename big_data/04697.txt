Electroweak and Majorana Sector Higgs Bosons

and Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons

Abstract

We propose a Clifford algebra based model, which treats both gravity and Yang-
Mills interactions as gauge ﬁelds. There are two sectors of boson ﬁelds as electroweak
and Majorana bosons. The electroweak boson sector induces fermion masses via
spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is composed of scalar Higgs, pseudoscalar Higgs,
and antisymmetric tensor components. The Majorana boson sector contributes to ﬂa-
vor mixing and Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos. It is comprised of neu-
trino Higgs and pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The LHC 750 GeV diphoton res-
onance might possibly be identiﬁed as a Majorana sector pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
boson, which results from spontaneous symmetry breaking of a ﬂavor-related global
U (1) symmetry involving right-handed up, down, charm, and strange quarks. There
is also a potential dark matter candidate, which is the four-lepton condensation of
muon, muon-neutrino, tau, and tau-neutrino.

1 Introduction

Clifford algebra, also known as geometric algebra or space-time algebra, has found a wide
variety of applications in physics [1–15]. Attempts have been made to identify species of
fermions as ideals (idempotent projections of the original spinor) and derive Standard
Model gauge symmetries from various dimensions of Clifford algebras.

We propose a model which is based on Clifford algebra Cℓ0,6 ⊕ CℓT 1. It includes lo-
cal gauge symmetries SO(1, 3)LOR ⊗ SU(2)W L ⊗ U(1)W R ⊗ U(1)B−L ⊗ SU(3)C. There are
two sectors of bosonic ﬁelds as electroweak and Majorana bosons. The electroweak sec-
tor induces fermion masses via spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Majorana sector
contributes to ﬂavor mixing and Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos.

The experiments at LHC recently indicated a diphoton resonance at about 750 Gev
[16, 17]. The resonance might possibly be identiﬁed as a Majorana sector pseudo-Nambu-
Goldstone boson, which results from spontaneous symmetry breaking of a ﬂavor-related
global U(1) symmetry involving ﬁrst and second generation quarks.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces gauge symmetries and the
gauge-invariant action. In section 3, the Majorana boson sector is discussed. In section 4,
we study electroweak boson sector. In section 5, we brieﬂy touch upon the topic of grand
uniﬁcation symmetries. In the last section we draw our conclusions.

2 Gauge Symmetries and Gauge-Invariant Action

2.1 Leptons, Quarks, and Projection Operators

We begin with a review of Clifford algebra Cℓ0,6 [14]. It is deﬁned by anticommutators of
orthonormal vector basis {γj, Γj; j = 1, 2, 3}

(1)

(2)
(3)

(γjγk + γkγj) = −δjk,

[γj, γk] =
[Γj, Γk] = −δjk,
[γj, Γk] = 0,

where j, k = 1, 2, 3. All basis vectors are space-like. There are (cid:0)6

The complete basis for Cℓ0,6 is given by the set of all k-vectors. Any multivector can be
expressed as a linear combination of 26 = 64 basis elements.

k(cid:1) independent k-vectors.

Two trivectors

(4)
(5)
square to 1, so they are time-like. The orthonormal vector-trivector basis {γa, a = 0, 1, 2, 3}
deﬁnes space-time Clifford algebra Cℓ1,3, with

γ0 = Γ1Γ2Γ3,
Γ0 = γ1γ2γ3

hγaγbi = ηab = diag(1,−1,−1,−1),

(6)

where h· · ·i means scalar part of enclosed expression. The reciprocal vectors {γa} are
deﬁned by
(7)

γaηab = γb,

thus

Here we adopt the summation convention for repeated indices. Notice that γ0 is a trivec-
tor, rather than a vector.

hγaγbi = δa
b .

(8)

The unit pseudoscalar

i = Γ1Γ2Γ3γ1γ2γ3 = γ0γ1γ2γ3 = γ0Γ0

(9)

squares to −1, anticommutes with odd-grade elements, and commutes with even-grade
elements.
Reversion of a multivector M ∈ Cℓ0,6, denoted ˜M , reverses the order in any product of

vectors. For any multivectors M and N, there are algebraic properties

(MN)˜ = ˜N ˜M,
hMNi = hNMi .

The magnitude of a multivector M is deﬁned as

where

is the Hermitian conjugate.

|M| = phM†Mi,
M† = −i ˜M i,

(10)
(11)

(12)

(13)

(with Grassmann-odd coefﬁcients) of all 26 = 64 basis elements.

Algebraic spinor ψ ∈ Cℓ0,6 is a multivector , which is expressed as a linear combination
Spinors with left/right chirality correspond to odd/even multivectors

Here Pl is lepton projection operator, Pq is quark projection operator, and Pqj are color
projection operators. The bivectors Jj appearing in the color projectors Pqj suggest an
interesting duality between 3 space dimensions and 3 colors of quarks.

Now we are ready to identify idempotent projections of spinor

ψ = (P+ + P−)(ψL + ψR)(Pl + Pq1 + Pq2 + Pq3)

with left-handed leptons, red, green, and blue quarks

Spinors transform as

ψL → eΘLOR+ΘW LψLeΘJ−ΘST R,
ψR → eΘLOR+ΘW RψReΘJ−ΘST R.

(31)

(32)

It is worth noting that all gauge transformations are with Grassmann-even rotation an-
gles, so that the transformed spinors remain to be Grassmann-odd.

There are Lorentz SO(1, 3)LOR gauge transformations

Notice that the gauge groups contain both gravitational (SO(1, 3)LOR)1 and Yang-Mills

gauge transformations.

Because the product of lepton projector Pl with any generator in color algebra (37) is

zero PlTk = 0, leptons are invariant under color gauge transformations.

After symmetry breaking of SU(2)W L, U(1)W R, and U(1)B−L via Majorana and elec-
troweak Higgs bosons, which will be detailed in later sections, the remaining electromag-
netic U(1) symmetry is a synchronized double-sided transformation

where a shared rotation angle ǫE synchronizes the double-sided gauge transformation.

2.3 Gauge Field 1-Forms, Gauge-Covariant Derivatives, and Curvature

2-Forms

Gauge ﬁelds are Clifford-valued 1-forms (Clifforms [22, 23] with Grassmann-even coefﬁ-
cients) on 4-dimensional space-time manifold (xµ, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3)

(48)

where e is vierbein, ω is gravity spin connection, G is strong interaction, and the rest are
electroweak related interactions. Notice that we adopt the same notation for vierbein e ,
mathematical number e, and electron e. One should be able to differentiate them based
on contexts.

The vierbein ﬁeld e acts like space-time frame ﬁeld, which is essential in building all
actions as diffeomorphism-invariant integration of 4-forms on 4-dimensional space-time
manifold. The space-time manifold is initially without metric. It’s the vierbein ﬁeld which
gives notion to metric

Local gauge transformations are coordinate-dependent gauge transformations. Gauge

ﬁelds obey local gauge transformation laws

e(x) → eΘLOR(x)e(x)e−ΘLOR(x),
ω(x) → eΘLOR(x)ω(x)e−ΘLOR(x) − (deΘLOR(x))e−ΘLOR(x),
WL(x) → eΘW L(x)WL(x)e−ΘW L(x) − (deΘW L(x))e−ΘW L(x),
WR(x) → WR(x) − (deΘW R(x))e−ΘW R(x),
C(x) → C(x) − e−ΘB−L(x)(deΘB−L(x)),
G(x) → eΘST R(x)G(x)e−ΘST R(x) + eΘST R(x)(de−ΘST R(x)),

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

where d = dxµ∂µ.

It’s worth emphasizing that gravity related ﬁelds e(x) and ω(x) are treated as gauge

ﬁelds with local gauge transformation properties, as the rest Yang-Mills gauge ﬁelds.

Gauge-covariant derivatives of spinor ﬁelds ψL/R(x) are deﬁned by

DψL = (d + ω + WL)ψL + ψL(C − G),
DψR = (d + ω + WR)ψR + ψR(C − G).

(56)
(57)

The gravitational spin connection ω is essential in maintaining local Lorentz covariance
of DψL/R.

We introduce gauge curvature 2-forms by applying the covariant derivative to the

0-form spinor ψ and then to the 1-form spinor Dψ

D(DψL/R) = (d + ω + WL/R)DψL/R − DψL/R(C − G)

= (R + FW L/W R)ψL/R(FJ − FST R),

where gravity, left/right weak, J, and strong force curvature 2-forms are

L =

where k enumerates the Clifford components of each gauge ﬁeld.

Notice that the connection ﬁelds are deﬁned to absorb gauge coupling constants. As
a result, gauge coupling constants neither appear in the deﬁnition of gauge-covariant
derivatives of fermions DψL/R, nor appear in the gauge curvature 2-forms such as FW L =
dWL + W 2

L. They will show up in the gauge ﬁeld actions instead.

2.4 Gauge-Invariant Action

The local gauge- and diffeomorphism-invariant action is

SW orld =SSpinor−Kinetic

+SGravity + SY ang−M ills
+SM ajorana−Y ukawa + SM ajorana−Bosons
+SElectroweak−Y ukawa + SElectroweak−Bosons.

The spinor kinetic action is now written down as

SSpinor−Kinetic ∼ Z (cid:10) ¯ψLie3DψL + ¯ψRie3DψR(cid:11),

where e3 is vierbein 3-form, and ¯ψL/R are deﬁned as

¯ψL/R = ψ†L/Rγ0 = −i ˜ψL/Riγ0 = ∓ ˜ψL/Rγ0.

Here outer products between differential forms are implicitly assumed.

One can write down the action for gravity as

SGravity ∼ Z (cid:28)ie2(R +

Λ
24

e2)(cid:29),

(66)
(67)
(68)
(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

where e2 is vierbein 2-form, R = dω + ω2 is spin connection curvature 2-form, and Λ is
cosmological constant.

The Yang-Mills action is written as

SY ang−M ills = SW L + SW R + SJ + SST R,
SW L ∼ Z (cid:10)(e2FW L)2(cid:11) /(cid:10)ie4(cid:11),
SW R ∼ Z (cid:10)(e2FW R)2(cid:11) /(cid:10)ie4(cid:11),
SJ ∼ Z (cid:10)(e2FJ )2(cid:11) /(cid:10)ie4(cid:11),
SST R ∼ Z (cid:10)(e2FST R)2(cid:11) /(cid:10)ie4(cid:11),

8

(73)

(74)

(75)

(76)

(77)

where e4 is vierbein 4-form.

From an effective ﬁeld theory point of view, an inﬁnite number of terms allowed by
symmetry requirements should be included in a generalized action. The gravity and
Yang-Mills actions above are the ﬁrst few order terms [14] that are relevant in low-energy
limit.

The Clifford algebra elements, which are related to left-(e, ω, WL, WR) and right-(C,
G)sided gauge ﬁelds, are formally assigned to two sets of Clifford algebras in Yang-Mills
action (and other actions without spinor ﬁelds). Elements from different sets formally
commute with each other. Here h· · ·i means scalar part of both sets.
It’s understood that 4-form factor d4x in one of e2F in each Yang-Mills term should be
canceled out by 4-form factor d4x in the denominator before any further outer multiplica-
tion of differential forms as

Z (cid:28) e2F
hie4i

e2F(cid:29).

(78)

In this way, the Yang-Mills action is a diffeomorphism-invariant integration of 4-form on
4-dimensional space-time manifold.

There is no explicit Hodge dual in Yang-Mills action. Vierbein plays the role of Hodge
dual, when it acquires nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the case of ﬂat space-
time, which will be discussed in next section.

Yukawa and boson portions of the action will be subjects of later chapters.

2.5 Local Lorentz Symmetry Breaking and Minkowskian Space-time

Up to this point, the action is constructed in curved space-time, with space-time depen-
dent vierbein and spin connection. In a vacuum with zero cosmological constant Λ = 0,
vierbein ﬁeld e acquires a nonzero Minkowskian ﬂat space-time VEV

< 0|e|0 >= δa

µγadxµ = γµdxµ,

while VEV of spin connection is zero

The space-time metric reduces to

< 0|ω|0 >= 0.

gµν = heµeνi = ηµν.

(79)

(80)

(81)

The soldering form γµdxµ breaks the independent local Lorentz gauge invariance (on
Clifford components with Roman indices such as in γaγb) and diffeomorphism invariance
(on differential forms with Greek indices such as in dxµ). The action is left with a residual
global Lorentz symmetry, with synchronized Clifford space and x coordinate space global
Lorentz rotations. Actually the speciﬁc VEV form γµdxµ is a result of coordinating the
above two kinds of global rotations.

9

With the substitution of vierbein and spin connection with their VEVs, the spinor ki-

netic action(70) in ﬂat Minkowskian space-time can be rewritten as

where

SSpinor−Kinetic = Z (cid:10) ¯ψLγµDµψL + ¯ψRγµDµψR(cid:11) d4x,
DµψL/R = (∂µ + WL/Rµ)ψL/R + ψL/R(Cµ − Gµ).

Similarly, the Yang-Mills action(73) can be rewritten as

(83)

(86)

(87)

where gW L, gW R, gJ, and gST R are dimensionless gauge coupling constants.

In the following chapters, however, we will stay with local Lorentz gauge invariant

curved space-time formulation.

2.6 Relation to Conventional Matrix Formulation
A map can be constructed by placing the Dirac column spinor ˆψ in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the algebraic spinor ψ. And the mappings for the operators are

ˆγµ ˆψ ↔ γµψ, (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3)
ˆi ˆψ ↔ ψi,
ˆγ5 ˆψ ↔ −iψi

(88)

(89)

(90)

where ˆi is the conventional unit imaginary number, and ˆγµ and ˆγ5 are the Dirac matrix
operators.

We will not go into the details of further mappings [14] in this paper.

3 Majorana Bosons

3.1 Flavor Projection Operators

With the purpose of studying 3 generations of fermions, we turn to another kind of Clif-
ford algebra involving ternary communication relationships [24, 25] rather than the usual

10

binary ones. Let’s consider ternary CℓT 1, which is deﬁned by

with ζ commuting with Cℓ0,6

[ζ, ζ, ζ] = ζ 3 = 1,

ζγj − γjζ = 0,
ζΓj − Γjζ = 0.

and Pl and Pq are lepton and quark projection operators, respectively.

We label 3 generations of spinors as ψL/Rj. They are valued in Cℓ0,6. The spinor kinetic

action involves 3 families of fermions as

SSpinor−Kinetic ∼Z (cid:10) ¯ψLjie3DψLjPj + ¯ψRjie3DψRjPj(cid:11).

(104)

Here h· · ·i means scalar part of both Cℓ0,6 and CℓT 1. There is no ﬂavor-mixing cross term
in kinetic action. Flavor mixing is the subject of next section. It is induced via Majorana
Boson ﬁelds.

It should be noted that there is another Clifford algebra based approach called spin-
charge-family theory [4]. It predicts a fourth family, coupled to the observed three fam-
ilies. The theory offers the explanation for the origin of the Higgs ﬁeld and the Yukawa
couplings. It also predicts a second group of four families, with the lowest of these four
families explaining the origin of dark matter.

3.2 Majorana Yukawa Action

Fields in Majorana boson section interact with right-handed fermions only. The Lorentz,
isospin, and color singlet Majorana boson section contains two ﬁelds

The neutrino Higgs ﬁeld φν is valued in Clifford space spanned by 2 trivectors

φM AJ = φν + Φ.

It obeys gauge transformation rules

{Γ0Pl, iΓ0Pl}.

where

φν → e− ˇΘW R−ΘB−Lφνe ˇΘW R+ΘB−L,

where yjk and Yjk are Majorana Yukawa coupling constants, and eεjkΓ1Γ2 are phase factors.
There are four fermions in the Yukawa terms of Φjk, while Higgs boson φν interacts
with two fermions. The four-fermion Yukawa coupling constants Yjk are of mass dimen-
sion −3. Thus four-fermion Yukawa terms are nonrenormalizable. A later section will
discuss the effective theory point of view and the issue of nonrenormalizability.

there are properties

P2φν = φνP3,
P3φν = φνP2,

(119)
(120)
(121)

according to the deﬁnition of ﬂavor projection operators (95, 97, 99). Therefore, there are
ﬂavor-mixing terms (113) between 2nd and 3rd generation neutrinos, as evidenced in the
observation of neutrino oscillations [26–28].

Likewise, allowable ﬂavor-changing four-fermion Yukawa terms are also dictated by
the properties of ﬂavor projection operators. Additionally, we require that the four-
fermion combination should accommodate a global U(1) symmetry, which will be studies
in next section. The ﬁve Φ12, Φ13A, Φ13B, Φ22, and Φ23 Yukawa terms, with fermion conﬁg-
urations ¯uRsR¯cRdR, ¯uRτR ¯ντ RdR, ¯νeRbR¯tReR, ¯cRµR¯νµRsR, and ¯νµRτR ¯ντ RµR, are the ones satis-
fying both conditions.

After φν and Φ acquire nonzero VEVs, which will be investigated in later section, the
ﬂavor mixing between right-handed fermions is represented by neutrino Majorana mass
terms and four-fermion interaction terms. Higher order processes can introduce further
effective mixing between generations. One may potentially couple above effects with
appropriate choices of Majorana and electroweak Yukawa coupling constants to explain
the quite different patterns of CKM and PMNS2 matrices.

3.3 Flavor-Related Global U (1) Symmetry

As mentioned earlier, Φ boson is invariant under all gauge transformations related to
gauge interactions. Nevertheless, for Φ12 there is a ﬂavor-related global U(1) symmetry
under the following transformations

Φ12 → Φ12eθ12i,
u1 = u → ueθui,
d1 = d → deθdi,
u2 = c → ceθci,
d2 = s → seθsi,

(122)

(123)

(124)

(125)

(126)

2See ref. [29, 30] for attempts to explain the PMNS matrix pattern.

13

where

θ12 = (θu − θd) − (θc − θs),

(127)

and u, d, c, and s are up, down, charm, and strange quarks. The phase θ12 measures rota-
tion angle difference between ﬁrst and second generation quarks in ¯uRsR¯cRdR.

Because of

¯uR = u†Rγ0,
¯cR = u†Rγ0,

moving a phase factor θi around Clifford-odd γ0 changes its sign as

(θi)u†Rγ0 = u†Rγ0(−θi),
(θi)c†Rγ0 = c†Rγ0(−θi).

(128)

(129)

(130)

(131)
(132)

This is the reason of the speciﬁc sign for each θ in θ12.

By the same token, ¯uRτR ¯ντ RdR, ¯νeRbR¯tReR, ¯cRµR¯νµRsR, and ¯νµRτR¯ντ RµR correspond to

phases

θ13A = (θu − θd) − (θντ − θτ ),
θ13B = (θνe − θe) − (θt − θb),
θ22 = (θc − θs) − (θνµ − θµ),
θ23 = (θνµ − θµ) − (θντ − θτ ).

(133)
(134)
(135)
(136)

In the event of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), there will be a massive sigma
mode and a massless Nambu-Goldstone mode for each Φij. As opposed to the Higgs
mechanism, the Nambu-Goldstone mode is not ’eaten’ by gauge ﬁeld.

Notice that above global symmetry is an approximate symmetry. The electroweak
section spoils the symmetries θ12, θ13A, θ13B, θ22, and θ23 explicitly. And the neutrino Higgs
ﬁeld φν Yukawa terms do not respect symmetries θ13A, θ13B, θ22, and θ23. The Nambu-
Goldstone modes are not exactly massless. The sizes of the masses grow with the strength
of the explicit symmetry breaking. A not-quite-massless would-be Nambu-Goldstone
particle for an approximate symmetry is often called a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson
(pNGB). These ﬂavor-related pNGBs represent phase differences between four different
fermions.

Electroweak Yukawa coupling constants of quarks are usually larger than those of
leptons. If Majorana Yukawa coupling constants follow the same pattern, Y12 might be
the largest and Y23 might be the smallest.

Since boson ﬁelds Φij are free from direct gauge interactions, they are potential dark
matter candidates. Φ23 might be the prime candidate due to its small Yukawa coupling
constant, which means suppressed decaying rate.

14

Given that the Yukawa term with Y12 is the dominant one, in the following analysis we
will concentrate on Φ12, and treat the model as if Φ = Φ12. The treatment of other ﬁelds
Φ13A, Φ13B, Φ22, and Φ23 should follow the same logic as Φ12. Going forward, we will not
explicitly write down formulas for Φ13A, Φ13B, Φ22, and Φ23.

Neutrino Majorana masses are much heavier than neutrino Dirac masses, if we assume

where constants yν and υ are electroweak Higgs counterparts, which will be deﬁned in

trinos, known as seesaw mechanism.

(163)

(164)

If we assume that υν >> υ and υΦ >> υ, gauge boson Z′, Higgs boson φν, and sigma
mode of Φ would be too heavy to be detected at electroweak energy scale. On the other
hand, the pNGB of Φ12 is not exactly massless, since the electroweak sector explicitly
breaks the global symmetry and can generate mass for it. The size of the Φ12 pNGB mass
is proportional to electroweak scale. Hence it is detectable at LHC.

The experiments at LHC recently indicated a diphoton resonance at about 750 Gev [16,
17], in addition to the earlier ﬁnding of Higgs boson with mh = 125 Gev [31, 32]. Various
explanations have been offered [33–48]. Scenarios with either an isospin singlet state or
an isospin doublet state usually need an extended particle content to accommodate the
observed signal.

The LHC 750 GeV diphoton resonance might possibly be identiﬁed as the pNGB with

involving ﬁrst and second generation quarks.

A resonance starts with four quarks (two quark-antiquark pairs) produced by two
gluons. Two of the quarks interact with VEV < 0|Φ†12|0 > and turn into other two quarks.
And then the four quarks turn into a Φ12 pNGB via the four-fermion Yukawa term. The
pNGB propagates and ﬁnally decays in a reverted generation process. The reverted pro-
cess has two external photon lines, instead of two external gluon lines.

The width of the resonance might be due to involvement of other three bosons Φ13A,
Φ13B, and Φ22. The weaker resonance of Φ13A (Φ13B or Φ22) also starts with two quark-
antiquark pairs produced by two gluons. Via the four-fermion Yukawa term, two of the
quarks interact with VEV < 0|Φ†13A|0 > (< 0|Φ†13B|0 > or < 0|Φ†22|0 >) and turn into two
leptons. And then the four fermions turn into Φ13S (Φ13B or Φ22 ) pNGB. The width of
the 750 Gev resonance might be due to the addition of weaker resonance signals coming
from Φ13A, Φ13B, and Φ22 pNGBs with different masses from Φ12.

3.5 Four-Fermion Condensation

Boson sectors might be just an effective Ginzbrug-Landay-type description of the low en-
ergy physics represented by composite boson ﬁelds. One approach is to assume effective

17

four-quark interactions strong enough to induce top quark-antiquark condensation into
composite electroweak Higgs ﬁelds [49–52], via dynamical symmetry breaking mecha-
nism in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [53] (NJL) like models.

The four-quark contact term in top condensation model is

Z (cid:10)¯qLeqL¯tRe3tR(cid:11),

(165)

where qL = tL + bL, e and e3 are vierbein 1-form and 3-form.

Likewise, the Majorana boson ﬁelds are also collective excitations of underlying com-
posite spinors. For example, φν and Φ are effective representation of two-neutrino and
four-quark condensations

ˇφν = y11P1¯νR1e4Γ2Γ3νR1P1,

+ y23P2¯νR2e4Γ2Γ3νR3P3 + h.c.,

ˇΦ = Y12P1¯uRe4sRP2¯cRe4dR/(cid:10)ie4(cid:11) + h.c..

The four-neutrino and eight-quark interactions are

Z (cid:10) ˇφν† ˇφν(cid:11) /(cid:10)ie4(cid:11) +Z (cid:10) ˇΦ† ˇΦ(cid:11) /(cid:10)ie4(cid:11).

(166)
(167)

(168)

(169)

A collective mode is determined as the pole of bosonic channel of the four-fermion
interaction by summing to inﬁnite order chains of bubble perturbation diagrams. The
leading order calculation goes by different names such as random-phase approximation,
Bethe-Salpeter T-matrix equation, and 1/N expansion.

If the Majorana bosonic ﬁeld Φ is indeed a collective excitation of the underlying four
fermions, the ﬁrst order approximation would involve summing to inﬁnite order chains of
’bubble’ diagrams, linked together via eight-fermion contact interactions. Each ’bubble’
contains four lines of fermion propagators, rather than two lines.

In addition to ¯uRsR¯cRdR, four-fermion condensations can also involve four other right-
handed conﬁgurations ¯uRτR ¯ντ RdR, ¯νeRbR¯tReR, ¯cRµR¯νµRsR, and ¯νµRτR ¯ντ RµR. Free from di-
rect gauge interactions, these four-fermion condensations are potential dark matter can-
didates. The prime candidate might be the four-lepton condensation ¯νµRτR ¯ντ RµR, due to
its small Yukawa coupling constant and suppressed decaying rate.

3.6 The Issue of Nonrenormalizability

The four-fermion Yukawa terms of Φ and four/eight-quark contact interactions are non-
renormalizable in the conventional sense.

For nonrenormalizable models, the renomalization procedure can be made only at the
cost of adding increasing numbers of term to the original Lagrangian. In principle, there is
no problem with a theory having an inﬁnite number of coupling constants as an effective

18

ﬁeld theory [54]. However, the NJL model is often regarded as regularization-dependent
and its predictability is called into question.

A novel strategy for handling divergences is called implicit regularization [55].

It
avoids the critical step of explicit evaluation of divergent integrals. The ﬁnite parts are
separated from the divergent ones and integrated free from effects of regulation. The
application to NJL model reveals that it can be ambiguity-free and symmetry-preserving
can be obtained, making the NJL model predictive.

Likewise, we expect that models with four-fermion Yukawa interactions or eight-

fermion contact terms are as predictive as renormalizable theories.

4 Electroweak Bosons

4.1 Electroweak Bosons and Yukawa Action

Electroweak boson ﬁeld φEW interacts with both left-handed and right-handed fermions,
while Majorana boson ﬁeld φM AJ interacts with right-handed fermions only. Electroweak
Boson ﬁeld φEW spans the whole 32 component Cℓ0,6 even space. It obeys gauge transfor-
mation rules

φEW → eΘLOR+ΘW LφEW e−ΘLOR−ΘW R.

It can be broken down into three ﬁelds as

φEW = φS + φP + φAT ,

with scalar φS valued in Clifford space spanned by 4 multivectors

pseudoscalar φP valued in Clifford space spanned by 4 multivectors

{1, ΓjΓk;

j, k = 1, 2, 3, j 6= k},

{i, iΓjΓk;

and antisymmetric tensor φAT valued in Clifford space spanned by 4∗ 6 = 24 multivectors

The scalar and pseudoscalar electroweak Higgs ﬁelds φS and φP transform as

while the antisymmetric tensor electroweak boson ﬁeld φAT transforms as

φS/P → eΘW LφS/P e−ΘW R,

φAT → eΘLOR+ΘW LφAT e−ΘLOR−ΘW R.

19

(175)

Notice that φAT is not a Lorentz singlet, since it’s not invariant under local Lorentz gauge
transformations.

the moment assume that its VEV is zero.

After replacing φS, φP , and φAT with their VEVs, the electroweak Yukawa action re-

duces to

Z (cid:10)(¯νjie4mν

(191)

(192)

(193)

(194)

(195)

so that the fermion Dirac masses are ’real’ (scalar) -valued. If scalar and pseudoscalar
Higgs ﬁelds have different conﬁgurations of Yukawa coupling constants, the rotation an-
gles are spinor (ν/e/u/d) speciﬁc.

Since the experiments at LHC indicated only one Higgs boson with mh = 125 Gev
[31,32], there could be two scenarios. Case one is that both scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs
ﬁelds contribute to the electroweak symmetry breaking and their masses are degenerate

(196)
Case two is that only one of them acquires a nonzero VEV (with negative −µ2), which is
the mh = 125 Gev Higgs. The other maintains a zero VEV (with positive µ2), which is still
waiting to be detected at LHC.

mh = mS = mP .

4.3 Antisymmetric Tensor Boson

The antisymmetric tensor boson is a bridge between gravity and electroweak sector. The
strong connection between gravity ﬁeld and electroweak Higgs ﬁeld has also been stud-
ied in a geometrical 5D uniﬁcation approach [56], which deduces all the known interac-
tions from an induced symmetry breaking of the non-unitary GL(4)-group of diffeomor-
phisms.

As stated earlier, the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld φAT is not invariant under Lorentz

gauge transformations. Hence, its boson potential should involve Lorentz invariant

as opposed to

(cid:10) ¯φAT φAT(cid:11) = Dγ0φ†AT γ0φATE ,

|φAT|2 = Dφ†AT φATE ,

which is not Lorentz invariant.

It’s easy to see that (cid:10) ¯φAT φAT(cid:11) is not a positive deﬁnite quantity. Components of

{γaγb, γaγbΓjΓk;

j, k = 1, 2, 3, j 6= k, a, b = 1, 2, 3, a 6= b},

have positive ’metric’ and components of

{iγaγb, iγaγbΓjΓk;

j, k = 1, 2, 3, j 6= k, a, b = 1, 2, 3, a 6= b},

have negative ’metric’.

We can divide φAT as

φAT = φAT s + φAT p,

(205)

(206)

(207)

(208)

(209)

where φAT s and φAT p are valued in positive and negative ’metric’ components, respec-
tively. Thus we have

(cid:10) ¯φAT φAT(cid:11) = |φAT s|2 − |φAT p|2.

22

(210)

A zero VEV < 0|φAT|0 > is allowed only if µ2

can be acquired for any value of µ2
breaks electroweak and Lorentz symmetries.

AT , including µ2

AT = 0. On the other hand, nonzero VEV
AT = 0. Nonzero VEV simultaneously

In the case of µ2

AT = 0, the four-boson-ﬁeld term in the boson potential enforces

Therefore, the VEV should be on the ’light cone’, which means

((cid:10) ¯φAT φAT(cid:11))2 = (|φAT s|2 − |φAT p|2)2 = 0.

|φAT s|2 = |φAT p|2.

(211)

(212)

Replacing φAT with nonzero < 0|φAT|0 > in the boson kinetic action, we have a Lorentz

symmetry breaking term

Z (cid:10)(e3(ω < 0|φAT|0 > − < 0|φAT|0 > ω)¯)(e3(ω < 0|φAT|0 > − < 0|φAT|0 > ω))(cid:11) /(cid:10)ie4(cid:11).

(213)

This spin connection ω related term can contribute to space-time torsion equation. We
call it ’dark spin current’. It is a counterpart of dark energy, with the former affecting
space-time torsion and the later affecting space-time curvature.

Since we know that torsion could have gravitational and cosmological consequences
[57, 58], it’s worth further research on the above antisymmetric-tensor-induced scenario.

5 Possible Grand Uniﬁcation Symmetries

We now explore more symmetries allowed by an algebraic spinor. Let’s begin with gen-
eral gauge transformations

where eΘ and eΘ′ ∈ Cℓ0,6 are independent gauge transformations. Spinor bilinear

D ˜ψγ0ψE

e ˜Θγ0eΘ = γ0,
eΘ′

˜Θ′ = 1,
e

where we restrict our discussion to gauge transformations continuously connected to
identity. General solution of these equations includes Θ ∼ so(4, 4), which is a linear
combination of 28 gauge transformation generators

{γa, γaγb, ΓaΓb, iΓj, Γ0γjΓk; j, k = 1, 2, 3, a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3, a > b} ∈ Θ,

(218)

23

and Θ′ ∼ sp(8), which is a linear combination of 36 gauge transformation generators of
pseudoscalar, all bivectors, and all trivectors

{i, γjΓk, γkγl, ΓkΓl, γ0, Γ0, γ0γjΓk, Γ0γjΓk; j, k, l = 1, 2, 3, k > l} ∈ Θ′.

(219)

(220)

is a subalgebra of Θ.

The Clifford odd parts of Θ and Θ′ mix odd (left-handed ψL) and even (right-handed
ψR) spinors. Since we know that left- and right-handed spinors transform differentially,
only Clifford even subalgebras of Θ and Θ′ are permitted, namely

{γaγb, ΓaΓb} ∈ ΘEven ∼ so(1, 3) ⊕ so(1, 3),
{i, γjΓk, γkγl, ΓkΓl} ∈ Θ′Even ∼ u(1) ⊕ so(6) ∼ u(1) ⊕ su(4).

(221)
(222)
The gauge transformations {ΓaΓb} can be further decomposed into weak transforma-
tions {ΓkΓl} and weak boost transformations {Γ0Γj}, which are counterparts of spacial
rotation {γkγl} and Lorentz boost transformations {γ0γj}.
Unitary algebra u(3) is embedded in {γjΓk, γkγl, ΓkΓl} ∼ su(4). Removing u(1) {J}
from u(3) deﬁnes the color algebra su(3).
Since there are left-handed weak su(2)L and right-handed weak u(1)R, one might ex-
pect left-right symmetric su(2)R as well. We can even go further and entertain the possi-
bility of two exact copies of left-handed ΘEvenL and right-handed ΘEvenR. It means that
left- and right-handed fermions have separate local Lorentz gauge symmetries {γaγb}L
and {γaγb}R. Thus there are left- and right-handed gravities.
Of course, the symmetries studied in this section are speculative in nature. If there is
indeed grand uniﬁcation scale physics involving ΘEvenL, ΘEvenR and Θ′Even, either sym-
metry breaking or other mechanism is needed to prevent detection of gauge interactions
related to pseudoscalar {i}, quark/lepton mixing part of su(4), weak boost {Γ0Γj}, W ±R
part of su(2)R, and differences between left-handed {γaγb}L and right-handed {γaγb}R
Lorentz transformations.
It’s an interesting topic. Nevertheless, we leave it to future
research.

6 Conclusion

We propose a model which is based on Clifford algebra Cℓ0,6 ⊕ CℓT 1. With the purpose
of studying 3 generations of standard model fermions, a ternary Clifford vector is intro-
duced alongside 6 binary Clifford vectors. The model includes local gauge symmetries
SO(1, 3)LOR ⊗ SU(2)W L ⊗ U(1)W R ⊗ U(1)B−L ⊗ SU(3)C.
There are two sectors of bosonic ﬁelds as electroweak and Majorana bosons. Elec-
troweak boson ﬁeld interacts with both left-handed and right-handed fermions. Majo-
rana boson ﬁeld interacts with right-handed fermions only.

24

The electroweak boson sector is composed of scalar, pseudoscalar, and antisymmet-
ric tensor components. Scalar and/or pseudoscalar Higgs ﬁelds break the electroweak
symmetry, contributing masses to fermions.

The Majorana boson sector is comprised of neutrino Majorana Higgs and pseudo-
Nambu-Goldstone bosons. It is responsible for ﬂavor mixing between generations. The
neutrino Higgs ﬁeld part of Majorana boson sector acquires a nonzero VEV via sponta-
neous symmetry breaking, inducing Majorana masses of right-handed neutrinos.

The LHC 750 GeV diphoton resonance might possibly be identiﬁed as a Majorana sec-
tor pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), which results from spontaneous symmetry
breaking of a ﬂavor-related global U(1) symmetry. The symmetry involves right-handed
up, down, charm, and strange quarks. The pNGB is not exactly massless, since the elec-
troweak sector explicitly breaks the global symmetry and can generate mass for it.

The pNGB might be a composite boson representing right-handed four-quark conden-
sation ¯uRsR¯cRdR via dynamical symmetry breaking. Four-fermion condensations can also
involve four other conﬁgurations of ¯uRτR¯ντ RdR, ¯νeRbR¯tReR, ¯cRµR¯νµRsR, and ¯νµRτR¯ντ RµR.
Free from direct gauge interactions, the four-lepton condensation ¯νµRτR ¯ντ RµR is a poten-
tial dark matter candidate, due to its small Yukawa coupling constant and suppressed
decaying rate.
