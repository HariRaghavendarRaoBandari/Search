We study weak coupling perturbative series in 4d N = 2 and 5d N = 1 supersymmetric gauge
theories with Lagrangians. We prove that the perturbative series of these theories in zero instanton
sector are Borel summable for various observables. We also prove Borel summability in arbitrary
number of instanton sector when we know explicit expression of Nekrasov instanton partition func-
tion.

INTRODUCTION

Weak coupling perturbation theory in quantum ﬁeld
theory (QFT) typically yields asymptotic series [1]. One
of standard ways to resum asymptotic series is Borel re-
summation: when we have a perturbative series I(g) =

ℓ=0 cℓga+ℓ, Borel summation is given by

P∞

Z ∞

g BI(t),

(1)

cℓ

ℓ=0

where BI(t) is analytic continuation of the Borel transfor-
mation P∞
Γ(a+ℓ) ta+ℓ−1 after taking the summation.
However, it is expected that perturbative series in typical
interacting QFT is not Borel summable due to singular-
ities at positive real axis in BI(t) [2].
Nevertheless one might wonder if situation becomes
better in theories with huge symmetries such as extended
supersymmetric (SUSY) theories.
Indeed some SUSY
theories have some protected quantities, which do not
receive quantum corrections or receive only one-loop cor-
rection. On the other hand it is totally unclear for unpro-
tected observables, which receive higher loop perturba-
tive corrections and non-perturbative corrections, when
perturbative series are convergent, Borel summable or
non-Borel summable.

Main purpose of this paper is to provide strong ev-
idence for this expectation. Namely we prove Borel
summability [26] of perturbative series in general 4d
N = 2 theories with Lagrangians for various observables
[27]. We also prove Borel summability in arbitrary num-
ber of instanton sector when we know explicit expression
of Nekrasov instanton partition function [12]. In section
II we give proofs for S4 partition function, SUSY Wilson
loop, Bremsstrahrung function, extremal correlator and
squashed S4 partition function with help of localization
[13]. Our result strongly suggests that the expectation
from the resurgence approach is true and we can “de-
ﬁne” N = 2 theory in a ﬁxed number of instanton sector
from perturbative data.

In section III we also discuss 5d N = 1 gauge theories.
While 5d gauge theory is not renormalizable in the sense
of power counting, one can reasonably compute some ob-
servables in UV complete theories [14]. We can prove
Borel summatbility of perturbative series for squashed
S5 partition function and SUSY Wilson loop.

Recently there appeared an interesting hint [3] to this
question from resurgence approach to asymptotic free
gauge theory on S1 × R3 (see also [4]). The authors in
[3] argued that ambiguities of resummation in QCD-like
theories are canceled by so-called bion-anti-bion contri-
butions [5]. While this scenario is expected for non-SUSY
theory and N = 1 theory, there are no bion solutions in
theories with N ≥ 2 SUSY [6]. Therefore it is expected
that perturbative expansions themselves in N ≥ 2 theo-
ries do not have ambiguities and are Borel summable. If
this is true, then this would imply that 4d N = 2 the-
ory can be “deﬁned” in terms of only perturbative data.
However currently there are very few examples to sup-
port this expectation, which are S4 partition functions
and SUSY Wilson loops in SU (2), U (2) gauge theories
[7, 8], and extremal correlators in superconfomal QCD
with SU (2) and SU (3) gauge groups [9] (see also [10]).

4D N = 2 THEORY

A. S 4 partition function

We begin with partition function on S4. Let us con-
sider 4d N = 2 theory with semi-simple gauge group
G = G1 × ··· × Gn and Nf hyper multiplets of rep-
resentations (R1,··· , RNf ). Thanks to the localization
method, the S4 partition function can be expressed in
terms of the following ﬁnite dimensional integral [13]

tons, which are described by Nekrasov instanton parti-
tion function ZNek(a) [12] with Ω-background parameters

Here we prove that the small-g expansion of Z (k1,··· ,kn)

is Borel summable and this is true also for various ob-
servables.
It is also interesting to ask property of the
expansion by instanton number as in [8] but this is be-
yond scope of this paper.

S4

SU (N ) superconformal QCD

First we focus on the 4d N = 2 SU (N ) superconfor-
mal QCD with 2N fundamental hyper multiplets. We
will consider more general theory later. The S4 partition
function of this theory in k-instanton sector is given by

We would like to know property of small-g expansion of

SQCD. For this purpose let us take the coordinate

ai = √tˆxi,

(8)

where ˆx = (ˆx1,··· , ˆxN ) is the unit vector spanning unit
SN −1. Then we rewrite the partition function as [30]

Note that this takes the form of the Laplace transforma-
tion as in the Borel resummation formula (1). So it would
be natural to expect that f (k)(t) is Borel transformation
of the original perturbative series, namely analytic con-
tℓ [31]. We will prove this

in the following steps: (I) We show that the integrand
h(k)(t, ˆx) is identical to analytic continuation of a con-
vergent power series of t. (II) We ask if we can exchange
the power series expansion of h(k)(t, ˆx) and integration
over ˆx. We show this by proving uniform convergence of
the small-t expansion. (III) The Laplace transformation
(9) guarantees that the coeﬃcient of the perturbative se-
ries of f (k)(t) at O(t
).
For simplicity we ﬁrst focus on zero-instanton sector
and non-zero instanton sector will be considered later.
By using product representation of the Barnes G-function
[32], h(0)(t, ˆx) can be written as

The small-t expansion of h(0) has a ﬁnite radius of con-
vergence t0, which is dependent on ˆx but larger than 1.
Hence h(0) is the same as analytic continuation of the
convergent power series of t.

Next we show commutativity of the summation and
integration over ˆx by proving uniform convergence of the
small-t expansion of h(0). For this purpose it is conve-
nient to apply Weierstrass’s M-test. Namely we ﬁnd a
sequence {Mℓ} satisfying |h(0)
ℓ=0 Mℓ <
∞ for ﬁxed t. We can easily ﬁnd such a series. For
example, since ζ(2ℓ − 1) < 2, |ˆx| ≤ 1, a generating func-
tion ¯h(0)(t) of Mℓ can be obtained by the replacements

ℓ (ˆx)| < Mℓ andP∞

Thus f (0)(t) is actually the Borel transformation of the
original perturbative series.

To show Borel summability of the perturbative series
we should ask analytic property of the Borel transforma-
tion f (0)(t). First f (0)(t) does not have branch cut along
t ∈ R+ though this has a branch cut along t ∈ R− for
even N [33]. Structure of poles can be easily seen from
the inﬁnite product representation (11) of h(0). Since
h(0) cannot have poles unless t ∈ R− and integration
is ﬁnite dimensional over compact region, f (0) does not
have poles along positive real axis. Thus, we conclude
that the perturbative series of ZSQCD in zero instanton
sector is Borel summable. As we discuss below, gener-
alization to other theories and observables, and nonzero
instanton sector are quite straightforward.

General theory with Lagrangian

Generalization to other theories is quite parallel to the
case of the SQCD. First we insert delta function con-
straint ∆(a) to the integrand as in (7) such that the fol-
lowing coordinate

a(p)

(14)
parametrizes sphere with the radius √tp. Then the par-
tition function again takes the form of Laplace transfor-
mation with multi variables:

. Let us focus on zero-
instanton sector again. Then we can always prove that
h(k1,··· ,kn) with kp = 0 gives a uniform convergent power
series of t. Namely we can always construct convergent
series as in (13) to pass Weierstrass’s M-test. Hence
f (k1,··· ,kn)(t) at zero instanton sector is actually Borel
transformation. The Borel transformation cannot have
poles and branch cut along positive real axis. Therefore
the perturbative series of ZS4 in zero instanton sector
is Borel summable for general N = 2 theory with La-
grangian.

Nonzero instanton sector

3

Generalization to arbitrary number of instanton sec-
tor is also straightforward when we know explicit
forms of Nekrasov partition functions. This is because
Z (k1,··· ,kn)
(a) for all the known cases is rational function
of a, whose poles are not located at real axis. For exam-
ple, Nekrasov partition function of U (N ) SQCD with Nf
fundamentals and anti-fundamentals is given by [34]

where Yj is Young diagram associated with aj and

Eij (a, s)(ǫ1 + ǫ2 − Eij (a, s)),

i,j(a, Y ) = Ys∈Yi
Eij (a, s) = −ǫ1AYj (s) + ǫ2(LYi(s) + 1) − i(ai − aj),
j (a, Y ) = Ys∈Yj
nf
φj (a, s) = −iaj + ǫ1(sh − 1) + ǫ2(sv − 1).

φj(a, s)(φj (a, s) + ǫ1 + ǫ2),

(18)

Here s = (sh, sv) labels box in Young tableau at sh-th
column and sv-th row, and LY (AY ) is leg (arm) length
of Young tableau Y at s. Although the contribution from
each Young diagram may have poles along real axis of a,
poles of this type are canceled after summing over Young
diagrams with the same instanton number [13]. This is
true unless m1ǫ1 + m2ǫ2 (m1,2 ∈ Z) can be purely imag-
inary but ZS4 for this case is ill-deﬁned and therefore
we do not consider this case. This feature is common
among all the cases, where expressions of Nekrasov par-
tition function are explicitly known.

Keeping this in mind, now we can easily prove Borel
summability as in zero instanton sector. Since h(k1,··· ,kn)
is product of h(0,··· ,0) and rational function of √tp, small-t
expansion of h(k1,··· ,kn) is always uniform convergent and
hence f (k1,··· ,kn)(t) is always Borel transformation of the
original perturbative series. We can easily see that the
Borel transformation cannot have poles and branch cuts
along positive real axis by using the above property of
Zinst. Thus the perturbative series of ZS4 in arbitrary
number of instanton sector is Borel summable.

B. Other observables

Supersymmetric Wilson loop

Generalization to some other observables is straight-

forward as well. First let us consider the Wilson loop

WR(C) = trRP exp"IC

ds(Aµ ˙xµ + iΦ)#,

(19)

where Φ is the adjoint scalar in vector multiplet. The
Wilson loop is supersymmetric when the contour C is the
grand circle of S4. By applying the localization method,
VEV of the Wilson loop is represented by the following
VEV of the matrix model

hWR(Circle)i = htrReaiM.M..

(20)

Since this is just ﬁnite linear combination of exponentials,
this does not give anything harmful. Thus repeating the
above arguments, we can prove that perturbative series
of the SUSY Wilson loop is Borel summble. Obviously
products of Wilson loops also give Borel summable per-
turbative series.

Bremsstrahrung function in SCFT

Bremsstrahrung function B appears in cusp anoma-
lous dimension of small boost: Γcusp(ϕ) = Bϕ2 + O(ϕ4),
where ϕ is the boost parameter. This determines an en-
ergy radiated by accelerating quarks [16]. It was conjec-
tured that the Bremsstrahrung function in N = 2 super-
conformal theory is given by the following VEV of the
matrix model [17]

are two diﬀerences from the round S4 partition function.
One is one-loop determinant [20, 21]:

(24)
The other is values of Ω-background parameters in ZNek,
which are ǫ1 = b, ǫ2 = b−1.

Υ(x) = Ym1,m2≥0

Repeating the argument for ZS4, we can always rewrite
as the Laplace transformation as in (15) and show
ZS4
that f (k1,··· ,kn)(t) for ZS4
is Borel transformation of orig-
inal perturbative series. However, pole structure of the
Borel transformation is slightly more involved. This
depends on b and we have poles in real positive axis
when m1b + m2b−1 (m1,2 ∈ Z) can be purely imaginary
[35]. Because the partition function for this region is
ill-deﬁned, we conclude that ZS4
gives Borel summable
perturbative series when it is well-deﬁned.

which is formally derivative of the supersymmetric Wil-
son loop in fundamental representation with winding
number b. Since we have shown Borel summability for
the Wilson loop, B is also Borel summable.

Extremal correlator in SCFT

Next we consider the correlation function

Z1loop(a) =

We also study perturbative series of 5d N = 1 SUSY
theory. First we study squashed S5 partition function
with squashing parameters (φ1, φ2, φ3), which has a sim-
ple relation to SUSY Renyi entropy [22]. We can show
Borel summability of perturbative series in a quite par-
allel way to the 4d case. The S5 partition function can
be computed by localization [23] and this takes the form
of (2). While classical part is the same up to redeﬁnition
of g [36], one-loop part is given by

Qα∈root S3(−iα · a; ~ω)/(α · a)
QNf
m=1Qρm∈Rm S3(−iρm · a + ω1+ω2+ω3

; ~ω)
(25)

where ~ω = (ω1, ω2, ω3) with ωj = 1 + φj and

(~n· ~ω − z), (26)

(~n· ~ω + z) Yn1,n2,n3≥1

S3(z; ~ω) = Yn1,n2,n3≥0
with ~n· ~ω = n1ω1 + n2ω2 + n3ω3. Instanton contribution
for this case is product of three 5d Nekrasov partition
functions with Ω-background parameters (ǫ1, ǫ2) = (φ2 −
φ1, φ3 − φ1), (φ3 − φ2, φ1 − φ2) and (φ1 − φ3, φ2 − φ3).
Nekrasov partition function in 5d is not rational function
but ratio of hyperbolic functions. As in 4d case, the
5d Nekrasov partition function does not have poles in
real axis unless m1ǫ1 + m2ǫ2 (m1,2 ∈ Z) can be purely
imaginary. Since the S5 partition function is ill-deﬁned
when ~n · ~ω + (ω1 + ω2 + ω3)/2 and m1ǫ1 + m2ǫ2 can be
purely imaginary, we do not consider these cases.
Now we can prove Borel summability for the S5 par-
tition function as in 4d. First by the transformation

(cid:10)OI1 (x1)···OI1 (xn)O ¯J (y)(cid:11) ,

(22)

where OI and O ¯I are chiral and anti-chiral primary op-
erators, respectively. This is often called extremal cor-
relator. It is known that this is determined by the two

two point function is given by a ratio of (ﬁnite) linear

point function (cid:10)OI (x)O ¯J (y)(cid:11). It was shown [9] that the
combination of the quantity hQj(tramj )njiM.M.. We can

show Borel summability for this quantity by repeating
the above aruments and hence perturbative series for the
extremal correlator is also Borel summable.

Squashed S 4 partition function

Next let us consider partition function ZS4

on squashed
S4 with a squashing parameter b. This has a simple
relation to supersymmetric Renyi entropy [18, 19]. There

b

(14), we can rewrite the partition function in the form of
Laplace transformation as in (15). A similar argument
shows that the integrand is again Borel transformation.
Then as long as the partition function is well-deﬁned, the
Borel transformation does not have singularity along pos-
itive real axis of Borel plane. Thus we conclude that the
perturbative series of the S5 partition function is Borel
summable for arbitrary number of instanton sector.

We can also show Borel summability for supersymmet-
ric Wilson loop on round S5. The Wilson loop of the type
(19) is supersymmetric when its contour is Hopf ﬁbre at
one point of CP2 base. The result of localization is

hWR(Hopf ﬁbre)i = htrRe2πaiM.M..

(27)

Insertion of this operator does not spoil our argument as
in 4d and thus perturbative series of the SUSY Wilson
loop is also Borel summble.

IV. DISCUSSIONS

We have studied the weak coupling perturbative series
in 4d N = 2 and 5d N = 1 SUSY gauge theories with
Lagrangians. We have proven Borel summability of the
perturbative expansions in zero instanton sector for vari-
ous observables. We have also proven Borel summability
in arbitrary number of instanton sector when we know ex-
plicit forms of Nekrasov partition functions. Our result
strongly suggests that the expectation from the resur-
gence approach is correct and this would imply that one
can “deﬁne” N = 2 theory around ﬁxed number of in-
stanton background from perturbative expansion.
Our result also shows that the Borel resummation in
a ﬁxed number of instanton sector is exactly the same as
the truncation of the full result to this sector. This means
that the Borel resummation in the zero instanton sector
does not give the full result including instanton correc-
tions and perturbative series in each number of instan-

ton sector is “isolated” in some sense. Thus perturbative
data in diﬀerent numbers of instanton sector do not mix
with each other. This feature was already pointed out in
[8] for SU (2) and U (2) cases. Our result says that this is
common for quite general 4d N = 2 and 5d N = 1 the-
ories. This feature seems philosophically diﬀerent from
an expectation from recent resurgence approach, where
perturbative data in zero instanton sector is related to
one in non-zero instanton sector. We shall ask if these
features are common for less SUSY theories or not.

It is interesting to consider perturbative series of ’t
Hooft loop in 4d N = 2 theory, whose localization for-
mula has been obtained in [24]. Apparently it seems more
involved because the ’t Hooft loop receives corrections
from monopoles as well as instantons.

It would be also illuminating to study perturbative se-
ries of 3d CS matter theories on S3 by inverse of CS level
as in [7, 8]. We cannot naively apply our argument to
these theories because exponential factor is purely imag-
inary for these theories. Hence we need to change in-
tegral contour to get usual Laplace transformation but
this change picks up residues from poles of integrand.
Probably we should think of it more carefully.

We close by mentioning that our result would be closely
related to a connection between planar limit and “very
strong coupled large-N limit” discussed in [25]. It is at-
tractive if one can make it more precise from our view-
point.

[26] By “Borel summability”, we mean Borel summability
along positive real axis throughout this paper. However,
if the localization formula is still correct for complex
g, then our argument also shows Borel summability in
right-half complex plane except squashed sphere parti-
tion functions.

[27] Strictly speaking, we prove that the perturbative series
are convergent or asymptotic but Borel summable. Hence
our result is consistent with expected convergence in pla-
nar limit [11]. We also assume that S 4 partition function
is well deﬁned. Physically this corresponds to conformal
ﬁeld theory, its mass deformation and asymptotic free
theory.

[28] We can also include FI-term and mass. Eﬀects of the
FI-term and mass are addition of a linear function of a
in the exponent of Zcl and a constant shift in one-loop
and instanton parts, respectively. These do not spoil our
proof as long as the mass is real.

[29] We are considering unit S 4. For S 4 with radius r, the

Ω-background parameters are ǫ1 = ǫ2 = r−1.

[30] This expression for SU (2) already appeared in [7].

[36] When we have Chern-Simons (CS) term, there is tra3
term but this does not disturb our argument. Although
it would be interesting to study perturbation by (inverse
of) CS level as in 3d CS matter theory, this is beyond
scope of this paper.
