Abstract In Stoica (2016) a regularization procedure is suggested for regular-
izing Big Bang singularities in Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
spacetimes. We argue that this procedure is only appliable to one case of Big
Bang singularities and does not aﬀect other types of singularities.

Singularities are present in most physically relevant cosmological models and
challenge the validity of General Relativity as the theory of gravitation. It is
conjectured that such singularities will be removed or appeased by a quantum
theory of gravity or by corrections to Einstein’s theory.

In General Relativity the universe is a spacetime endowed with a metric
and at cosmological scale it is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic. Hence
the metric in coordinates t, r, θ, φ is given by

ds2 = −dt2 + a2(t)(cid:0)dr2 + r2(cid:0)dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

with the usual ranges for spherical coordinates. The only free function is the
scale factor a(t).

We consider here just ﬂat cosmological models since they appear to be

favored by observations.

Assuming that the universe is ﬁlled by a perfect ﬂuid with energy density
ρ and pressure p, the equations which relate them to the scale factor a(t) are
Friedmann’s equations

ρ =

3 ˙a2
a2 ,

p = −

2¨a
a −

˙a2
a2 .

(2)

The problem is solved if we know the equation of state for the ﬂuid, p = p(ρ)

or equivalently the barotropic index w = p/ρ.

For instance, if w is constant, we can integrate Friedmann’s equations

a(t) = a0t2/3(1+w),

(3)

up to a constant a0, obtaining power-law models. They are valid for epochs
with nearly constant equation of state. For these models, the energy density
and the pressure take the form

ρ(t) =

4

3(1 + w)2t2 ,

p(t) =

4w

3(1 + w)2t2 .

(4)

We see that for these models both energy density and pressure blow up as

t−2 at t = 0 in coordinate time. It is the Big Bang singularity.

For instance, in a radiation dominated epoch, w = 1/3, the scale factor
behaves as t1/2, whereas in a pressureless dust dominated epoch, w = 0, it
behaves as t2/3. The case w = −1 corresponds to a dark energy dominated
epoch and has a diﬀerent solution,

a(t) = a0e√Λ/3t,
in terms of the cosmological constant Λ.

ρ = Λ = −p,

Stoica (2016) suggests that Big Bang singularities may be removed by

replacing the energy density and the pressure by their densitized versions,

˜ρ = ρ√−g,

˜p = p√−g,

(5)

where g = a(t)3r2 sin θ is the determinant of the metric (1).

The key feature of the result is that the products ρa3, pa3 are expected to

be smooth instead of blowing up at Big Bang. According to Stoica (2016):

Theorem 1 If a is a smooth function, then the densities ˜ρ, ˜p are smooth (and
therefore nonsingular), even at moments t0 when a(t0) = 0.

Confronting this result with cosmological power-law models, we notice that
for them the products ρa3, pa3 behave as t−2w/(1+w). Hence, ˜ρ and ˜p do not
blow up at t = 0 if and only if the exponent −2w/(1 + w) is positive, that is,
if and only if w ∈ [−1, 0], that is, quintessence cosmological models.
Classical equations of state fall out of this result: For them energy condi-
tions (Hawking, Ellis (1973)) impose that w ∈ [0, 1]. The only case for which
˜ρ, ˜p are regular at t = 0 is the one of presureless dust, w = 0. This is to be
expected, since for these models the scale factor is not even a C1 function,
since behaves as a power of time t with exponent lower than one.

Although they are not considered in Stoica (2016), the same happens
with Big Rip singularities (Caldwell (2003)). These are strong singularities
(Fern´andez-Jambrina and Lazkoz (2006)) and correspond to power-law mod-
els with negative exponent, that is, w < −1.
There are also singularities with ﬁnite scale factor a(0) (Barrow (2004),
Fern´andez-Jambrina and Lazkoz (2004)). They are classiﬁed as Type II, III
and IV in Nojiri, Odintsov and Tsujikawa (2005) and V in D¸abrowski and Denkiewicz
(2009). For them close to t = 0 the scale factor behaves as a(t) ≃ a0 + a1tα,
with α > 0, and so the energy density and the pressure

ρ(t) ≃ 3a2

1α2t2(α−1),

p(t) ≃ 2a1α(1 − α)tα−2,

(6)

behave behave as their densitized versions. Multiplyling by a(t)3 does no aﬀect
their regularity.

Completing the classiﬁcation of cosmological singularities (Fern´andez-Jambrina

(2014)), we ﬁnd Grand Bang and Grand Rip singularities. For them the scale
factor vanishes or blows up exponentially, a(t) ≃ a0ea1t−α
, depending on the
sign of a1, negative por Grand Bang and positive for Grand Rip. In this case,
both the energy density and the pressure diverge as a power of coordinate
time,

ρ(t) ≃ 3a2

1α2t−2(α+1),

p(t) ≃ −3a2

1α2t−2(α+1),

and hence multiplying by a vanishing exponential scale factor (Grand Bang)
brings vanishing instead of diverging ˜ρ and ˜p. For Grand Rip singularities
(diverging exponential scale factor), ˜ρ and ˜p diverge.

Anyway, the use of non-diverging versions of energy density and pressure

in Einstein’s equations does not prevent the formation of singularities:

According to General Relativity, non-accelerated observers follow causal
geodesics on a spacetime endowed with a metric which is a solution of Ein-
stein’s equations. Geodesics can be parametrized using as parameter the proper
time τ , which is deﬁned by the relation dτ 2 = −ds2.
(1973)), that is, causal geodesics which cannnot be deﬁned for all values of
τ ∈ R.
(2006)): radial and comoving geodesics.

Singularities appear in the form of incomplete causal geodesics (Hawking, Ellis

In the case of FLRW spacetimes, there are two types of geodesics (Fern´andez-Jambrina and Lazkoz

Parametrizations of radial geodesics are obtained as solutions of ﬁrst order

equations,

t′ = r−ε +

P 2
a2 ,

r′ =

P
a2 ,

θ′ = 0, φ′ = 0,

(7)

where the prime stands for derivation with respect to τ . The constant P is a
conserved quantity of geodesic motion, which is the linear momentum of the
geodesic, and ε takes the value one for timelike geodesics and zero por lightlike
geodesics.

4

L. Fern´andez-Jambrina

If the conserved quantity P is zero, we have timelike comoving geodesics.
For these coordinate time is essentially proper time, since geodesics equations
reduce to

t′ = 1,

r′ = 0,

θ′ = 0,

φ′ = 0.

(8)

It is clear that regularizing the energy density and the pressure as in Stoica
(2016) does not aﬀect the formation of singularities according to the previous
equations.

Even in the case of timelike comoving geodesics, we could think in principle
that they are complete, since their parametrization is just t = τ + const. for
all values of the proper time τ . But most curvature invariants, for instance the
Ricci curvature R = −µ + 3p, point out that the manifold does not include
the locus t = 0, since the curvature becomes inﬁnite there, regardless of the
regularization.

Summarizing, we have shown that the regularization of the energy density
and the pressure suggested by Stoica (2016) does not allow the extension
of the spacetime beyond the Big Bang singularity, since the scale factor of
the universe a(t) is not aﬀected by this change and it is the only function
determining the geometry of the universe (1). In fact, the scale factor (3)
is not a C1 function at t = 0 for Big Bang singularities and hence second
order equations for it, such as Friedmann’s equations (2), are ill-deﬁned for
a(t). Causal geodesics still reach the singularity at t = 0 in ﬁnite proper
time, where they meet a curvature singularity, since curvature invariants of
the spacetime diverge as t−2, pointing out that the geometry of the universe is
singular there, regardless of the regularization. Besides, the rescaling (5) does
not produce regular versions of the energy density and the pressure in the case
of Big Bang singularities, except for the case of a pressureless dust equation
of state.
