Abstract. For a given class of modules A, we denote by eA the class
of exact complexes X having all cycles in A, and by dw(A) the class
of complexes Y with all components Yj in A. We consider a two sided
noetherian ring R and we use the notations GI (GF , GP) for the class of
Gorenstein injective (ﬂat, projective respectively) R-modules. We prove
(Theorem 1) that the following are equivalent: 1. Every exact complex of
injective modules is totally acyclic. 2. Every exact complex of Gorenstein
injective modules is in fGI. 3. Every complex in dw(GI) is dg-Gorenstein
injective. Theorem 2 shows that the analogue result for complexes of ﬂat
and Gorenstein ﬂat modules also holds. We prove (Corollary 1) that, over
a commutative noetherian ring R, the equivalent statements in Theorem 1
(as well as their counterparts from Theorem 2) hold if and only if the ring
is Gorenstein. Thus we improve on a result of Iyengar’s and Krause’s;
in [18] they proved that for a commutative noetherian ring R with a
dualizing complex, the class of exact complexes of injectives coincides
with that of totally acyclic complexes of injectives if and only if R is
Gorenstein. We are able to remove the dualizing complex hypothesis. In
the second part of the paper we focus on two sided noetherian rings that
satisfy the Auslander condition. We prove (Theorem 6) that for such
a ring R that also has ﬁnite ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimension, every complex of
injective (left and respectively right) R-modules is totally acyclic if and
only if R is a Gorenstein ring.

1. introduction

We recall that a module M is Gorenstein injective if and only if it is a cy-
cle of a totally acyclic complex of injective modules. Dually, a module G is
Gorenstein projective if it is a cycle of a totally acyclic complex of projective
modules. And a Gorenstein ﬂat module is a cycle of an F-totally acyclic
complex of ﬂat modules (see Section 2 for the deﬁnitions).
It is known that over a Gorenstein ring every exact complex of injective mod-
ules is totally acyclic. The analogous result for exact complexes of projective
modules and exact complexes of ﬂat modules also holds over Gorenstein rings.

It is a natural question to consider whether or not these conditions actually
characterize Gorenstein rings, or more generally whether or not it is possible
to characterize Gorenstein rings in terms of exact complexes of (Gorenstein)
injectives, (Gorenstein) projectives and (Gorenstein) ﬂats. This is one of the
main goals of this paper. In the commutative case we encompass and extend
recent results by Murfet and Salarian in [19] and by Iyengar and Krause in
[17]. We give equivalent characterizations of the condition that every exact
complex of injective modules is totally acyclic. It involves eA complexes, as
well as dg-A complexes, so we recall ﬁrst the following deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 1. Let A be a class of R-modules. An exact complex X is in eA
if Zj(X) ∈ A for all integers j.

Deﬁnition 2. Let (A, B) be a cotorsion pair in R-Mod. A complex Y is a
dg-A complex if each Yn ∈ A and if Ext1(Y, U) = 0 for any complex U in eB.
Throughout the paper we use GI to denote the class of Gorenstein injective
modules, GP for the class of Gorenstein projective modules, and GF for that
of Gorenstein ﬂat modules.

Our ﬁrst two results are the following:

Theorem 1 Let R be a two sided noetherian ring. The following are equiv-
alent:
1. Every exact complex of injective left R-modules is totally acyclic.
2. Every exact complex of Gorenstein injective left R-modules is in fGI.
3. Every complex of Gorenstein injective left R-modules is dg-Gorenstein
injective.

Theorem 2 Let R be a two sided noetherian ring. The following are equiv-
alent:
1. Every exact complex of ﬂat right R-modules is F-totally acyclic.
2. Every exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules is in gGF.
3. Every complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules is dg-Gorenstein ﬂat.

We also prove (Theorem 3) that when moreover R is right n-perfect (that
is, every ﬂat right R-module has ﬁnite projective dimension ≤ n) then state-
ments (1), (2), (3) in Theorem 2 are also equivalent to the following:
(4) Every exact complex of projective right R-modules is totally acyclic.
(5) Every exact complex of Gorenstein projective right R-modules is in fGP.
(6) Every complex of Gorenstein projective right R-modules is dg-Gorenstein

projective.
Iyengar and Krause proved in [17, Corollary 5.5] that over a commutative
noetherian ring with a dualizing complex every exact complex of injective
modules is totally acyclic if and only if R is a Gorenstein ring. In Corollary
1 we are able to drop the dualizing complex hypothesis and also use theo-
rems 1 and 2 to ﬁnd new characterizations of Gorenstein (commutative) rings:

Corollary 1 Let R be a commutative noetherian ring. Then the following
statements are equivalent:
1. R is a Gorenstein ring.
2. Every exact complex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic.
3. Every exact complex of ﬂat R-modules is F-totally acyclic.
4. Every exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat R-modules is in gGF.
5. Every exact complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is in fGI.
6. Every complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is dg-Gorenstein injec-
tive.
7. Every complex of Gorenstein ﬂat R-modules is dg-Gorenstein ﬂat.

If moreover R is n-perfect, for some n ≥ 0 (for instance if R has ﬁnite Krull
dimension) then Corollary 1 and Theorem 3 give that statements (1) - (7)
above are also equivalent to statements (8)-(10) below (Corollary 2):
(8) Every exact complex of projective R-modules is totally acyclic.
(9) Every exact complex of Gorenstein projective R-modules is in fGP.
(10) Every complex of Gorenstein projective R-modules is dg-Gorenstein
projective.

We consider then a two sided noetherian ring R such that every exact com-
plex of injective modules is totally acyclic. We prove (Proposition 3) that
if furthermore R satisﬁes the Auslander condition and has ﬁnitistic ﬂat di-
mension then every injective R-module has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. We use this
result to prove the following characterization of Gorenstein rings (Theorem
6):
Let R be a two sided noetherian ring of ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimension that satisﬁes
the Auslander condition. Then the following are equivalent:
1) R is Gorenstein.
2) Every exact complex of injective left R-modules is totally acyclic and every
exact complex of injective right R-modules is totally acyclic.

2. preliminaries

Throughout the paper R will denote an associative ring with unit (non nec-
essarily commutative). The category of left R-modules will be denoted by

4

SERGIO ESTRADA AND ALINA IACOB

R-Mod, and the category of unbounded complexes of left R-modules will
be denoted by Ch(R). Modules are, unless otherwise explicitly stated, left
modules.

We recall that an exact complex of projective modules P = . . . → P1 →
P0 → P−1 → . . . is said to be totally acyclic if for any projective R-module
P , the complex . . . → Hom(P−1, P ) → Hom(P0, P ) → Hom(P1, P ) → . . . is
still exact.
A module G is Gorenstein projective if it is a cycle of such a totally acyclic
complex of projective modules (G = Zj(P ), for some integer j).

Dually, an exact complex of injective modules I = . . . → I1 → I0 → I−1 →
. . . is said to be totally acyclic if for any injective R-module I, the complex
. . . → Hom(I, I1) → Hom(I, I0) → Hom(I, I−1) → . . . is still exact.
A module M is Gorenstein injective if it is a cycle in a totally acyclic complex
of injective modules (M = Zj(I) for some integer j).

We also recall that an exact complex of ﬂat left R-modules, F = . . . → F1 →
F0 → F−1 → . . . is said to be F-totally acyclic
if for any injective right
R-module I, the complex . . . → I ⊗ F1 → I ⊗ I0 → I ⊗ F−1 → . . . is still
exact.
A module H is Gorenstein ﬂat if it is a cycle in an F-totally acyclic complex
of ﬂat modules (H = Zj(F ) for some integer j).

A pair of classes (A, B) in an abelian category D is called a cotorsion pair
if B = A⊥ and A =⊥B, where for a given class of modules C, the right
orthogonal class C ⊥ is deﬁned to be the class of objects Y in D such that
Ext1(A, Y ) = 0 for all A ∈ A. Similarly, we deﬁne the left orthogonal class
⊥C. The cotorsion pair is called hereditary if Exti(A, B) = 0 for all A ∈ A,
B ∈ B, and i ≥ 1. The cotorsion pair is called complete if for each object
M in D there exist short exact sequences 0 → M → A → B → 0 and
0 → B ′ → A′ → M → 0 with A, A′ ∈ A and B, B ′ ∈ B.

Following Gillespie [12, Deﬁnition 3.3 and Proposition 3.6] there are four
classes of complexes in Ch(R) that are associated with a cotorsion pair (A, B)
in R-Mod:
1. An exact complex X is an A-complex if Zj(X) ∈ A for all integers j. We
denote by eA the class of all exact A-complexes.
2. An exact complex U is a B-complex if Zj(X) ∈ B for all integers j. We
denote by eB the class of all exact B-complexes.
3. A complex Y is a dg-A complex if each Yn ∈ A and each map Y → U is

TOTALLY ACYCLIC COMPLEXES

null-homotopic, for each complex U ∈ eB. We denote by dg(A) the class of
all dg-A complexes.
4. A complex W is a dg-B complex if each Wn ∈ A and each map V → W
is null-homotopic, for each complex V ∈ eA. We denote by dg(B) the class of
all dg-B complexes.

Yang and Liu showed in [21, Theorem 3.5] that when (A, B) is a complete
hereditary cotorsion pair in R-Mod, the pairs (dg(A), eB) and ( eA, dg(B))
are complete (and hereditary) cotorsion pairs. Moreover, by Gillespie [12,
Theorem 3.12], we have that eA = dg(A)T E and eB = dg(B)T E (where

E is the class of all exact complexes). For example, from the (complete
and hereditary) cotorsion pairs (P roj, R-Mod) and (R-Mod, Inj) one ob-
tains the standard (complete and hereditary) cotorsion pairs (E , dg(Inj))
and (dg(P roj), E). Over a left noetherian ring R, the pair (⊥GI, GI) is
complete hereditary cotorsion pair. This is essentially due to Krause in [18,
Theorem 7.12] (see Enochs and Iacob [5, Corollary 1] for a precise formula-
tion). Therefore ( g⊥GI, dg(GI)) is a complete cotorsion pair.
We recall that a ring R is right n-perfect if each ﬂat right R-module has ﬁ-
nite projective dimension ≤ n. Then if R is left coherent and right n-perfect
the pair (GP, GP ⊥) is also a complete hereditary cotorsion pair in the cat-
egory of right R-modules (see Bravo, Gillespie and Hovey [1, Proposition
8.10] or Estrada, Iacob and Odaba¸sı [10, Propostion 7]). Hence the pair
( fGP, dg(GP ⊥)) is a complete cotorsion pair.
Finally, if R is a right coherent ring, then (GF , GF ⊥) is a complete heredi-
tary cotorsion pair. This is due to Enochs, Jenda and L´opez-Ramos in [8].
The class GF ⊥ is known as the class of Gorenstein cotorsion modules and it
is usually denoted by GC. So the pair (gGF , dg(GC)) is a complete cotorsion
pair.

We also recall that given a class of modules A, we denote by dw(A) the class
of complexes of modules, X, such that each component, Xn, is in A.

3. main results

Proposition 1. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring such that every exact
complex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic. Then the character module
of any Gorenstein injective R-module is a Gorenstein ﬂat right R-module.

Proof. Let RG be a Gorenstein injective module. Then there exists an exact
complex of injective R-modules I = . . . → I1 → I0 → I−1 → . . . with
G = Z0(I). Then I ++ is an exact complex of injective R-modules, so by

6

SERGIO ESTRADA AND ALINA IACOB

hypothesis, I ++ is totally acyclic. Therefore G++ = Z0(I ++) is Gorenstein
injective. Since (G+)+ is Gorenstein injective, it follows that G+ is Gorenstein
ﬂat (by Holm [13], Theorem 3.6).
(cid:3)

Theorem 1 below gives equivalent characterizations of the condition that ev-
ery exact complex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic.

Theorem 1. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring. The following are equiv-
alent:
1. Every exact complex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic.
2. Every exact complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is in fGI.
3. Every complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is a dg-Gorenstein in-
jective complex.

Proof. 1. ⇒ 2. Let Y be an exact complex of Gorenstein injective modules.
Since (⊥GI, GI) is a complete hereditary cotorsion pair, we have that the
pair (dg(⊥GI), fGI) is a complete cotorsion pair in Ch(R). So there is a short
exact sequence 0 → Y → A → B → 0 with B ∈ dg(⊥GI) and with A ∈ fGI.
Both A and Y are exact complexes, so B is also exact. For each n we have a
short exact sequence 0 → Yn → An → Bn → 0 with both Yn and An in GI;
so Bn ∈ GI, for all n. Since Bn ∈⊥GI T GI, it follows that Bn is injective for
each integer n. Thus B is an exact complex of injective modules, and then,
by (1), B is totally acyclic. So Zn(B) is Gorenstein injective for all n.
The exact sequence 0 → Zn(Y ) → Zn(A) → Zn(B) → 0 with both Zn(A)
and Zn(B) Gorenstein injective gives that G.i.d.Zn(Y ) ≤ 1. We also have a
short exact sequence 0 → Zn(Y ) → Yn → Zn−1(Y ) → 0, with Yn Gorenstein
injective and G.i.d.Zn(Y ) ≤ 1. It follows that Zn−1(Y ) is Gorenstein injective
for all n. So Y ∈ fGI.
2. ⇒ 3. Let X be a complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules. Since
(E , dg(Inj)) is a complete cotorsion pair, there is an exact sequence 0 → A →
B → X → 0 with A a DG-injective complex and with B an exact complex.
Then for each n there is an exact sequence 0 → An → Bn → Xn → 0
with An injective and with Xn Gorenstein injective. It follows that each Bn
is Gorenstein injective. So B is an exact complex of Gorenstein injective
modules; by (2), B is in fGI, and therefore in dg(GI).
Let Y ∈ g⊥GI. The exact sequence 0 → A → B → X → 0 gives an exact
sequence 0 = Ext1(Y, B) → Ext1(Y, X) → Ext2(Y, A) = 0 (since Y is exact
and A is a DG-injective complex). It follows that Ext1(Y, X) = 0 for any
Y ∈ g⊥GI, so X ∈ dg(GI). So we have that dw(GI) ⊆ dg(GI). The other

TOTALLY ACYCLIC COMPLEXES

inclusion always holds, thus dg(GI) = dw(GI).
3. ⇒ 1. Let X be an exact complex of injective left R-modules. In particular,
X ∈ dw(GI) and by (3), X is in dg(GI). Since X ∈ dg(GI) and X is exact,
it follows that X ∈ fGI, and therefore Zn(X) ∈ GI for all n. Thus X is a
totally acyclic complex.

(cid:3)

Theorem 2. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring. Then the following are
equivalent.
1. Every exact complex of ﬂat right R-modules is F-totally acyclic.
2. Every exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules is in gGF .
3. Every complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules is a dg-Gorenstein ﬂat
complex.

Proof. 1. ⇒ 2. Let X be an exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat modules. Since
(gGF , dg(GC)) is a complete cotorsion pair there exists an exact sequence
0 → A → B → X → 0 with A ∈ dg(GC), and B ∈ gGF. Then for each
n we have an exact sequence 0 → An → Bn → Xn → 0 with both Bn
and Xn Gorenstein ﬂat modules. It follows that each An is Gorenstein ﬂat.
The complex A is in dg(GC), so each An is also Gorenstein cotorsion. Thus
An ∈ GF T GC ⊆ F lat, for all n. Also, since both B and X are exact, A is
an exact complex. So A is an exact complex of ﬂat modules; by (1), A is an
F-totally acyclic complex. Then Zn(A) is Gorenstein ﬂat for all n. And, since
A is both exact and in dg(GC), A is in fGC. Thus Zn(A) is also Gorenstein
cotorsion. So Zn(A) ∈ GF T GC ⊆ F lat. So A is a ﬂat complex.
For each n we have an exact sequence 0 → Zn(A) → Zn(B) → Zn(X) → 0
with Zn(A) ﬂat and Zn(B) Gorenstein ﬂat. It follows that G.f.d.Zn(X) ≤ 1,
for all n. But for each n there is also an exact sequence 0 → Zn(X) →
Xn−1 → Zn−1(X) → 0. Since G.f.d.Zn−1(X) ≤ 1, and Xn−1 ∈ GF it follows
that Zn(X) is Gorenstein ﬂat, for all n.
2. ⇒ 3. Let X be a complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules. Since
(dg(P roj), E) is a complete cotorsion pair, there exists an exact sequence
0 → X → C → D → 0 with D ∈ dg(P roj) and with C an exact complex.
Then for each n we have an exact sequence 0 → Xn → Cn → Dn → 0
with both Dn and Xn Gorenstein ﬂat modules. It follows that each Cn is
Gorenstein ﬂat. Thus C is an exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat modules, so
by (2), C is in gGF.
Let A ∈ fGC. The exact sequence 0 → X → C → D → 0 gives an exact
sequence 0 = Ext1(C, A) → Ext1(X, A) → Ext2(D, A) = 0 (since A is exact
and D is DG-projective). It follows that Ext1(X, A) = 0 for any A ∈ fGC, so
X ∈ dg(GF).
3. ⇒ 1. Let Y be an exact complex of ﬂat right R-modules. By (3),

8

SERGIO ESTRADA AND ALINA IACOB

Y ∈ dg(GF). Since Y is also exact it follows that Y is in gGF . Therefore
Zn(Y ) is Gorenstein ﬂat for each n. So Y is F-totally acyclic.

(cid:3)

Using Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 we obtain the following characterization of
commutative Gorenstein rings.

Corollary 1. Let R be a commutative noetherian ring. The following are
equivalent:

1. R is Gorenstein.
2. Every exact complex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic.
3. Every exact complex of ﬂat R-modules is F-totally acyclic.
4. Every exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat R-modules is in gGF .
5. Every exact complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is in fGI.
6. Every complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is dg-Gorenstein injec-
tive.
7. Every complex of Gorenstein ﬂat R-modules is dg-Gorenstein ﬂat.

Proof. 1. ⇒ 2. It follows from [7, Theorem 10.1.13(1)].

2. ⇒ 3. Let F be an exact complex of ﬂat modules. Then F + is an
exact complex of injective modules. By hypothesis F + is totally acyclic.
This means that Hom(I, F +) is exact for every injective module I. But
Hom(I, F +) ≃ (I ⊗ F )+. So (I ⊗ F )+ is exact, which implies that I ⊗ F is
exact, for every injective I. That is, F is F-totally acyclic.

3. ⇒ 1. This follows from Murfet and Salarian [19, Theorem 4.27].

This shows that conditions (1), (2) and (3) are equivalent. Finally, by The-
orem 2, (3), (4) and (7) are equivalent. And by Theorem 1, (2), (5) and (6)
are equivalent.
(cid:3)

We show that if R is a two sided noetherian ring such that R is also right
n-perfect, then the equivalent characterizations from Theorem 2 can be ex-
tended to include the analogue results for the Gorenstein projective modules.
The proof uses the fact that over such a ring R the pair (GP, GP ⊥) is a com-
plete hereditary pair. As noted in Section 2, this gives a complete cotorsion

pair, (dg(GP),

GP ⊥), in the category of complexes of right R-modules.

Theorem 3. Let R be a two sided noetherian and right n-perfect ring. The
following statements are equivalent:
1. Every exact complex of ﬂat right R-modules is F-totally acyclic.
2. Every exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules is in gGF .
3. Every complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules is a dg-Gorenstein ﬂat

4. Every exact complex of projective right R-modules is totally acyclic.
5. Every exact complex of Gorenstein projective right R-modules is in fGP.
6. Every complex of Gorenstein projective right R-modules is a dg-Gorenstein
projective complex.

Proof. By Theorem 2, statements (1), (2) and (3) are equivalent.
2 ⇒ 5. Let X be an exact complex of Gorenstein projective right R-
modules. Since the ring is coherent and right n-perfect, by Christensen,
Frankild and Holm [2, Proposition 3.7], every Gorenstein projective right
R-module is Gorenstein ﬂat. So X ∈ gGF . Then, for each j, Zj(X) ∈ GF .
By [10, Proposition 5], G.p.d.Zj(X) ≤ n. Since we have an exact sequence
0 → Zn+j(X) → Xn+j−1 → Xn+j−2 → . . . → Xj+1 → Zj(X) → 0 with
Zj(X) Gorenstein ﬂat and all the Xi’s projective right R-modules, it follows
that Zj+n(X) is Gorenstein projective for all integers j. But then by replac-
ing j with j − n we obtain that Zj(X) is Gorenstein projective for all j.
5. ⇒ 6. Let X be a complex of Gorenstein projective right R-modules.
There exists an exact sequence 0 → X → C → D → 0 with C ex-
act and with D a DG-projective complex. For each j, the exact sequence
0 → Xn → Cn → Dn → 0 with both Xn and Dn Gorenstein projective right
modules gives that each Cn is Gorenstein projective. Thus C is an exact
complex of Gorenstein projective right R-modules, so by (5), C is in fGP.
]
GP ⊥. The exact sequence 0 → X → C → D → 0 gives an exact
Let A ∈
sequence 0 = Ext1(C, A) → Ext1(X, A) → Ext2(D, A) = 0 (since D is DG-
projective, and A is exact).
Since Ext1(X, A) = 0 for any A ∈
pair it follows that X is a dg-Gorenstein projective complex.
6 ⇒ 2. Let X be an exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat right R-modules. Con-
sider a partial projective resolution of X:
0 → Y → Pn−1 → . . . → P0 → X → 0. Since R is right n-perfect and
each Xj is Gorenstein ﬂat by [10, Proposition 5] we have that for each j,
G.p.d.Xj ≤ n, so each Yj is Gorenstein projective. Then Y is an exact com-
plex of Gorenstein projective right R-modules, so, by (6), Y is in fGP. There-
fore Zj(Y ) ∈ GP for all j, so the exact sequence 0 → Zj(Y ) → Zj(Pn−1) →
. . . → Zj(P0) → Zj(X) → 0 gives that G.p.d.Zj(X) ≤ n for all j. By [2,
Proposition 3.7] we have G.f.d.Zj(X) ≤ G.p.d.Zj(X) ≤ n. The exact se-
quence 0 → Zj+n(X) → Xj+n−1 → . . . → Xj+1 → Zj(X) → 0 with all Xi
Gorenstein ﬂat and with G.f.d.Zj(X) ≤ n gives that Zj+n ∈ GF for all j.
Then by replacing j with j − n we obtain that Zj(X) is Gorenstein ﬂat for
all integers j. So X ∈ gGF .

For each n we have an exact sequence 0 → An → Bn → Xn → 0 with

so each An is a projective right R-module. Since A is an exact complex of
projective right R-modules, by (4), A is totally acyclic. The exact sequence
0 → Zn(A) → Zn(B) → Zn(X) → 0 with both Zn(A) and Zn(B) Gorenstein
projectives gives that G.p.d.Zn(X) ≤ 1, for all n. But then the exact sequence
0 → Zn+1(X) → Xn+1 → Zn(X) → 0 with Xn+1 Gorenstein projective and
with G.p.d.Zn(X) ≤ 1 gives that Zn+1(X) is Gorenstein projective.

Corollary 1 and Theorem 3 give the following:

Corollary 2. Let R be a commutative noetherian ring which is n-perfect,
for some integer n ≥ 0 (for instance if R has a dualizing complex). The
following are equivalent:
1. R is a Gorenstein ring.
2. Every exact complex of injective modules is totally acyclic.
3. Every exact complex of ﬂat R-modules is F-totally acyclic.
4. Every exact complex of Gorenstein ﬂat R-modules is in gGF .
5. Every exact complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is in fGI.
6. Every complex of Gorenstein injective R-modules is dg-Gorenstein injec-

8. Every exact complex of projective R-modules is totally acyclic.
9. Every exact complex of Gorenstein projective R-modules is in fGP.
10. Every complex of Gorenstein projective R-modules is dg-Gorenstein pro-
jective.

One of the main open problems in Gorenstein homological algebra is: “What
is the most general type of ring over which the class of Gorenstein injective
modules is (pre)covering (preenveloping respectively)?”. We give a suﬃcient
condition in order for GI be both covering and enveloping.

Theorem 4. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring such that every exact com-
plex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic. Then the class of Gorenstein
injective modules is both covering and enveloping in R-Mod.

Proof. By Proposition 1, over such a ring R the character module of any
Gorenstein injective R-module is Gorenstein ﬂat. By Iacob [15, Theorems
3 and 5], the class of Gorenstein injective R-modules is both covering and
enveloping.

(cid:3)

Theorem 5. Let R be a two sided noetherain ring such that every exact com-
plex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic. Then the class of Gorenstein
ﬂat right R-modules is preenveloping in R-Mod.

Proof. Since over such a ring the character modules of Gorenstein injective
modules are Gorenstein ﬂat the result follows from Iacob [16, Theorem 1]. (cid:3)

4. rings that satisfy the Auslander condition

We recall that Bass proved that a commutative noetherian ring R is a Goren-
stein ring if and only if the ﬂat dimension of the ith term in a minimal injec-
tive resolution of R is at most i − 1, for all i ≥ 1. In the non-commutative
case, Auslander proved that this condition is left-right symmetric (see Fos-
sum, Griﬃth and Reiten [11, Theorem 3.7]). In this case the ring is said to
satisfy the Auslander condition.
In [14] Huang introduces the notion of modules satisfying the Auslander con-
dition. We recall the deﬁnition ([14]): given a left noetherian ring R, a left
R-module M is said to satisfy the Auslander condition if the ﬂat dimension
of the ith term in the minimal injective resolution of M is at most i − 1 for
any i ≥ 1.
We also recall the following:
Theorem (this is part of [14, Theorem 1.3]) If R is a left noetherian ring
then the following are equivalent:
1. RR satisﬁes the Auslander condition.
2. f dRE 0(M) ≤ f dRM for any RM, where E 0(M) is the injective envelope
of M.
If moreover R is left and right noetherian then the statements above are also
equivalent to:
3. the opposite version of (i) (1 ≤ i ≤ 2).

We recall that a ring R has ﬁnite ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimension if the maximum
of ﬂat dimensions among the modules with ﬁnite ﬂat dimension is ﬁnite. In

the following we prove (Proposition 3) that if R is two sided noetherian of
ﬁnite ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimension, such that R satisﬁes the Auslander condition
and every exact complex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic then every
injective R-module has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension.
We recall that a module M is strongly cotorsion if Ext1(F, M) = 0 for any
module F of ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. By Yan [20, Theorem 2.5 and Proposi-
tion 2.14], if R has ﬁnite ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimension then (F , SC) is a complete
hereditary cotorsion pair (where F denotes the class of modules of ﬁnite
ﬂat dimension and SC is the class of strongly cotorsion modules). We use
this result to prove (Theorem 5) that if every exact complex of injective left
R-modules is totally acyclic and every exact complex of injective right R-
modules is totally acyclic then R is an Iwanaga-Gorenstein ring.

We start with the following result:

Lemma 1. If R is two sided noetherian such that every exact complex of
injective modules is totally acyclic, then any Gorenstein injective module is
strongly cotorsion.

Proof. By Proposition 1 the character module of any Gorenstein injective
R-module is Gorenstein ﬂat right R-module. By Iacob [15, Lemma 2], we
have that K ∈⊥GI if and only if K + is Gorenstein cotorsion right R-module.
Since for any ﬂat module K, we have that K + is an injective right R-module,
it follows that any ﬂat module is in ⊥GI.
Let C be a module of ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. Then there is an exact sequence
0 → Fn → . . . → F0 → C → 0 with each Fj ﬂat. Let G be a Gorenstein
injective R-module. Then by the above Extl(C, G) = 0 for all l ≥ n + 1.
Also, there is an exact sequence 0 → Gn → En−1 → . . . → E0 → G → 0 with
each Ej injective and with all Ker(Ej → Ej−1) Gorenstein injective. Then
Ext1(C, G) ≃ Extn+1(C, Gn) = 0. So G is strongly cotorsion.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring that satisﬁes the Auslander
condition and such that every exact complex of injective R-modules is to-
tally acyclic. Then every strongly cotorsion module has Gorenstein injective
dimension ≤ 1.

Proof. Let M be a strongly cotorsion module. Consider the exact sequence
0 → M → A → L → 0 with A injective. Since both A and M are strongly
cotorsion it follows that L is also strongly cotorsion. Since the injective en-
velope of RR is ﬂat it follows (from Enochs and Huang [4, Theorem 4.4(5)])
that the injective cover I0 → L is surjective. By Wakamatsu’s lemma ([7,
Corollary 7.2.3]) J0 = Ker(I0 → L) ∈ Inj ⊥. Hence we have the short exact

TOTALLY ACYCLIC COMPLEXES

sequence 0 → J0 → I0 → L → 0 with I0 injective and J0 ∈ Inj ⊥. Since A is
injective and I0 → L is an injective precover, there is a commutative diagram:

0

0

M

u

J0

f

g

A

u

I0

L

L

0

0

So we have an exact sequence: 0 → M → J0 ⊕ A → I0 → 0 with both M
and I0 strongly cotorsion modules. It follows that J0 is strongly cotorsion.
Then, by the same reasoning as above, there exists an exact sequence 0 →
J1 → I1 → J0 → 0 with I1 an injective module and with J1 in Inj ⊥. In
fact, since J0 ∈ Inj ⊥, we have that Ext1(E, J0) = Ext2(E, J1) = 0 for any
injective R-module E.
We show that J1 is a strongly cotorsion module.
Let F be a module of ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. Consider the exact sequence
0 → F → E → D → 0 with E the injective envelope of F . Since R satisﬁes
the Auslander condition, E has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. It follows that D is also
a module of ﬁnite ﬂat dimension, so Ext1(D, J0) = 0. The exact sequence
0 → F → E → D → 0 gives a long exact sequence

0 = Ext1(E, J1) → Ext1(F, J1) → Ext2(D, J1) → Ext2(E, J1) = 0.

So Ext1(F, J1) ≃ Ext2(D, J1).
Also, the exact sequence 0 → J1 → I1 → J0 → 0 gives the exact sequence:
0 = Ext1(D, J0) → Ext2(D, J1) → Ext2(D, I1) = 0. Thus Ext2(D, J1) = 0,
and by the above, Ext1(F, J1) = 0 for any R-module F of ﬁnite ﬂat dimen-
sion. So J1 is a strongly cotorsion module, and therefore its injective cover
is a surjective map. Continuing this process, we obtain an exact left injec-
tive resolution of L= . . . → I2 → I1 → I0 → L → 0. Pasting it together
with a right injective resolution of L, we obtain an exact complex of injective
. . . → I2 → I1 → I0 → E 0 → E 1 → . . .. By hypothesis, this
modules:
is a totally acyclic complex. So L is Gorenstein injective. Then the exact
sequence 0 → M → A → L → 0 with both A and L Gorenstein injective
modules gives that G.i.d.M ≤ 1.

Lemma 3. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring that satisﬁes the Auslander
condition. If V is a strongly cotorsion module of ﬁnite ﬂat dimension then
V is injective.

Proof. Consider the exact sequence 0 → V → E(V ) → W → 0 with
E(V ) the injective envelope of V . Since R satisﬁes the Auslander condi-
tion, f.d.(E(V )) < ∞. It follows that W also has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. Since
V is strongly cotorsion, Ext1(W, V ) = 0. So the sequence is split exact, and
therefore E(V ) ≃ V ⊕ W . Thus V is an injective module.
(cid:3)

Proposition 2. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring of ﬁnitistic ﬂat di-
mension and that satisﬁes the Auslander condition. If moreover every exact
complex of injective R-modules is totally acyclic then every strongly cotorsion
R-module is Gorenstein injective.

Proof. Let M be a strongly cotorsion R-module. Then its ﬂat cover is injec-
tive (by [4, Theorem 4.4(5)]), and therefore there exists an exact sequence
0 → J → I → M → 0 with I injective and with J ∈ Inj ⊥. Since (F , SC)
is a complete cotorsion pair (where F is the class of modules of ﬁnite ﬂat
dimension and SC that of the strongly cotorsion modules), there is also an
exact sequence 0 → J → U → V → 0 with U strongly cotorsion and with V
of ﬁnite ﬂat dimension.
Since I is an injective module we have a commutative diagram

J

I

M

and therefore an exact sequence 0 → U → I ⊕ V → M → 0.
Both M and U are strongly cotorsion, so V is also strongly cotorsion. But
V has ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. So by Lemma 3, V is injective.
And by Lemma 2, G.i.d.U ≤ 1. The exact sequence 0 → U → I ⊕ V →
M → 0 with I ⊕ V injective and with G.i.d.U ≤ 1 gives that M is Gorenstein
injective.

(cid:3)

Corollary 3. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring of ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimension
and satisﬁes the Auslander condition. If moreover every exact complex of
injective R-modules is totally acyclic then the class of strongly cotorsion R-
modules coincides with that of the Gorenstein injective modules.

Proof. This follows from Lemma 1 and Proposition 2.

We can prove now:

Proposition 3. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring of ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimen-
sion such that R satisﬁes the Auslander condition and every exact complex
of injective R-modules is totally acyclic. Then every injective R-module has
ﬁnite ﬂat dimension.

Proof. By Corollary 5 above we have that GI = SC in this case. It follows
that ⊥GI = F with F the class of modules of ﬁnite ﬂat dimension. Since the
class of injective modules is contained in ⊥GI, we have that Inj ⊆ F .
(cid:3)

We can give now the following characterization of Gorenstein rings:

Theorem 6. Let R be a two sided noetherian ring of ﬁnitistic ﬂat dimension
that satisﬁes the Auslander condition. The following are equivalent:
1. R is a Gorenstein ring.
2. Every exact complex of injective left R-modules is totally acyclic and every
exact complex of injective right R-modules is totally acyclic.

Proof. 1 ⇒ 2. is known ([7, Theorem 10.1.13]).
2 ⇒ 1. Let F be a ﬂat left R-module. Then F + is an injective right R-
module. By Proposition 3, f lat.dim.F + < ∞. Therefore inj.dim.F ++ < ∞.
Since R is left noetherian and F ⊆ F ++ is a pure submodule it follows that
inj.dimF ≤ inj.dim.F ++ < ∞ ([7, Lemma 9.1.5]). In particular, for F = R
we obtain that inj.dim.RR < ∞.
Since R is left and right noetherian and inj.dim.RR < ∞ it follows ([7],
Proposition 9.1.6) that inj.dimRR < ∞. Thus R is an Iwanaga-Gorenstein
ring.
