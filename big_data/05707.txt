MrBayes is a software for Bayesian phylogenetic inference (Huelsenbeck
and Ronquist, 2001; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003). Many new features
have been implemented since version 3.2 (Ronquist et al., 2012b), including
species tree inference under the multi-species coalescent model (BEST algo-
rithm) (Liu and Pearl, 2007); compound Dirichlet priors for branch lengths
(Rannala et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012); divergence time estimation us-
ing node dating (Hedges and Kumar, 2004; Yang and Rannala, 2006; Ho
and Phillips, 2009) or total-evidence dating (Ronquist et al., 2012a; Zhang
et al., 2016) methods under (relaxed) molecular clock (Huelsenbeck et al.,
2000; Thorne and Kishino, 2002; Drummond et al., 2006; Lepage et al.,
2007); marginal model likelihood estimation using stepping-stone sampling
(Xie et al., 2011); topology convergence diagnostics using the average stan-
dard deviation of split frequencies (ASDSF) (Lakner et al., 2008); BEAGLE
library (Ayres et al., 2012) support and parallel computing using MPI (Al-
tekar et al., 2004); among others.

There are two modern approaches on dating species divergence using
molecular data: node dating (e.g., Yang and Rannala, 2006; Drummond
et al., 2006) and total-evidence dating (e.g., Ronquist et al., 2012a; Zhang
et al., 2016). In a Bayesian framework, node dating calibrates one or several
internal nodes of the tree, each with a prior distribution derived from the fos-
sil record. While total-evidence dating uses the morphological data from the
fossil record and morphological and sequence data from extant taxa together
to infer the tree and divergence times. The age of each fossil is assigned a
prior distribution directly.

Several steps involve in Bayesian dating analysis, importantly including
data partitioning, specifying evolutionary model, calibrating internal nodes
or fossils, and setting priors for the tree and the molecular clock model.
In this tutorial, I demonstrate the molecular clock dating functionalities in
MrBayes 3.2 step by step, while focusing on total-evidence dating, using an
example dataset truncated from the Hymenoptera data analyzed in Ronquist
et al. (2012a); Zhang et al. (2016).

1 Getting Started

The program MrBayes is available from http://mrbayes.net (current ver-
sion 3.2.6). After downloading and installing MrBayes by following the man-
ual, we execute the program from terminal (or command prompt) by typing

2

mb (assuming the executable is in the user path and is named mb on Mac
OSX/Linux or mb.exe on Windows).

The prompt MrBayes > at the bottom means that MrBayes is running
and ready for your commands. In the following tutorial, the commands for
MrBayes are colored RED, the commands typing in terminal (or command
prompt) are colored BLUE.
(!!) Direct copy and paste the commands here may result in improper spac-
ing or line breaking in the program. Please copy the plain-text commands
included in the example ﬁle.

1.1 Partition the data

The full data includes 60 extant and 45 fossil hymenopteran taxa and 8
outgroup taxa. The alignment is divided into 8 partitions (Ronquist et al.,
2012a). To make it computationally tractable for this tutorial, the data is
truncated to 10 extant taxa (including 1 outgroup and 9 hymenopteran taxa)
and 10 fossils. Only the morphology (200 characters), 16S (100 sites) and
EF1α (210 sites) partitions are included, all partially. This example data
is available from https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/code/HEAD/tree/
test/hym.nex.

Use the execute command (exe for short) to read in the data named

hym.nex.

execute hym.nex

The following commands partition the data into four partitions: the morphol-
ogy, 16S, 1st and 2nd codon positions of Ef1α, and 3rd codon positions of
Ef1α, and exclude the incompatible (constant) characters (these commands
are included in the example data and have been executed automatically when
reading it in).

charset MV = 1-200
charset 16S = 201-300
charset Ef1a = 301-510
charset Ef1a12 = 301-510\3 302-510\3

charset Ef1a3 = 303-510\3
partition four = 4: MV, 16S, Ef1a12, Ef1a3
set partition = four
exclude 7 31 61 83 107 121 122 133 182 183 198

It is much worth mentioning that the build-in help in MrBayes is very
informative and explanatory. We can type help followed by the keyword to
retrieve the corresponding help message. For example,

help charset
help partition
help lset

1.2 Evolutionary model

For the morphology partition, we use the M k Model (Lewis, 2001) with
variable ascertainment bias (only variable characters scored), equal state fre-
quencies and gamma rate variation across characters.

lset applyto = (1) coding = variable rates = gamma
If instant change is only allowed between adjacent states (e.g., only 0 ↔ 1
and 1 ↔ 2), these characters are speciﬁed using ctype ordered. The other
characters are thus allowed to change instantly from one state to another.

ctype ordered : 20 23 27 30 36 41 42 44 46 48 59 65 75 78 79 89

99 112 117 134 146 157 159 171 185 191 193 196

For the molecular partitions, we use the general time-reversible model
with gamma rate variation across sites (GTR+Γ) (Yang, 1994a,b). The
widely used invariable sites and gamma (+I+Γ) model is pathological due
to strong correlation between the proportion of invariable sites (p0) and the
gamma shape parameter (α) (e.g., Zhang et al., 2012), and is avoided.

lset applyto = (2,3,4) nst = 6 rates = gamma

The numbers after applyto should match the order of partitions deﬁned
above. The default prior for the shape parameter α of gamma(α, β) (α = β,
Figure 1) is exponential(1.0), which can be changed using prset shapepr.
We keep the default here.

Diﬀerent partitions are assumed to have independent substitution param-

eters, thus we unlink them.

Figure 1: Probability density function of the gamma distribution. The shape
α and rate β are ﬁxed equal so that the mean is 1.0. The exponential
distribution is a special case of gamma when α = 1.

unlink statefreq = (all) revmat = (all) shape = (all)

It is reasonable to account for evolutionary rate variation across parti-

tions, so that diﬀerent partitions can have diﬀerent substitution rates.

ically, (cid:80)

prset applyto = (all) ratepr = variable
The partition-speciﬁc rate-multipliers, {mi}, have mean equal to 1.0. Specif-
i pimi = 1, where pi is the proportion of sites in partition i to the
total number of sites. By default, ratepr = variable speciﬁes a uniform
Dirichlet prior for {pimi} (A special case of Dirichlet is uniform on 2 par-
titions). Note the diﬀerence between partition-speciﬁc rate and site-speciﬁc
rate inside a partition. The sites in partition i have the same partition-speciﬁc
rate mi, while each site again has a site-speciﬁc rate ri from gamma(αi, αi)
distribution in the +Γ model.

Molecular data only provide evolutionary distances in units of evolution-

uct of the geological time duration (e.g.
in Myr) and the evolutionary rate
(e.g.
in substitutions per site per Myr). To estimate times and rates sepa-
rately, it is necessary to introduce additional model assumptions.

Early studies assumed the evolutionary rate is constant over time (called
global clock or strict clock) (Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965). To set a
strict clock model with mean rate at 0.001 per site per Myr, we can use
a lognormal(-7,0.6) prior for the clock rate, c. The branch length vj is the
geological time duration tj multiplied by c.

prset clockratepr = lognorm(-7,0.6)
prset clockvarpr = strict

Figure 2: Probability density functions of normal, lognormal and gamma
distributions, all with mean 0.001 and standard deviation 0.0007. The expo-
nential distribution has mean and standard deviation both equal to 0.001.

There are several options for the clock rate prior, including fixed, normal

The probability density functions of the distributions (all with mean 0.001)
are shown in Figure 2. Here I take some space to explain the lognormal
distribution, as I think it is confusing. If x ∼ lognormal(µ, σ) then log(x) ∼
normal(µ, σ). The mean of x is e(µ+σ2/2) and the median of x is eµ. The
variance of x is (eσ2 − 1)e(2µ+σ2). Thus the mean for lognormal(-7, 0.6) is

e(−7+0.62/2) = 0.001 and the standard deviation is(cid:112)(e0.62 − 1)e(−2×7+0.62) =

0.0007.

It is more realistic to assume variable evolutionary rate over time. There
are three relaxed clock models implemented in MrBayes: compound Poisson
process (CPP, Huelsenbeck et al., 2000), autocorrelated lognormal (TK02,
Thorne and Kishino, 2002) and independent gamma rate (IGR, Lepage et al.,
2007). We just focus on the IGR and TK02 model, as the CPP model is not
working currently for total-evidence dating (see below).

Figure 3: Illustration of the TK02 and IGR relaxed clock models. The relaxed
clock tree on the right is resulted from the strict clock tree by multiplying
its branch lengths with the relaxed clock rates.

In the TK02 model (Figure 3), the (relative) evolutionary rate changes
along the branches as Brownian motion on the log scale, starting from 1.0
(0.0 on the log scale) at the root. The rate at the end of a branch j on the
tree is lognormal distributed with mean (not the log of the mean) equal to
the rate at the beginning of the branch and variance equal to bjσ2
T K, where
bj is the product of geological time duration tj and the base clock rate c. The
branch length vj is then calculated as bj multiplied by the arithmetic mean
of the two rates at both ends. The TK02 model is speciﬁed using

rja = 1.0TK02rjb = 0.881.021.11.051.120.93IGRbjbj vj=bj(rja+rjb)/2vj=bjrjrj=0.941.011.061.040.991.1prset clockvarpr = tk02

The prior for c was already set above using clockratepr. The prior for σ2
is speciﬁed by

T K

prset tk02varpr = exp(1)

The IGR model assumes that the (relative) rate for branch j is gamma
distributed with mean 1.0 and variance σ2
IG/bj (Figure 3). The rates for
diﬀerent branches are independent but not identical. The branch length vj
is then calculated as bj multiplied by the branch rate. In equivalent, vj is
gamma distributed with mean bj and variance bjσ2
IG (original deﬁnition in
Lepage et al., 2007). The IGR model is speciﬁed using

prset clockvarpr = igr

and the prior for σ2

IG is speciﬁed by

prset igrvarpr = exp(10)

Note that when the branch rates are all ﬁxed to 1.0 for TK02 or IGR, it
becomes the strict clock model. For the likelihood calculation (Felsenstein,
1981), the evolutionary distance (number of substitutions per site) for branch
j, site k in partition i is djik = vjmirik (where mi is the partition-speciﬁc
rate, rik is the site-speciﬁc rate).

Before doing total-evidence dating and node dating, we ﬁrst deﬁne the

outgroup and fossil group,

outgroup Raphidioptera
taxset fossils = Asioxyela Nigrimonticola Xyelotoma

Undatoma Dahuratoma Cleistogaster Ghilarella
Mesorussus Prosyntexis Pseudoxyelocerus

and some constraints for later use. Note these constraints are not enforced
until we set topologypr explicitly (see below).

constraint root = 1-.
constraint HymenFossil = 2-.
constraint Hymenoptera = 2-10
constraint Holometabola = 1-10
constraint Tenthredinidae = 3-5
constraint CepSirOruApo = 7-10

1.3 Total-evidence dating

In the following, we incorporate fossil information and assign priors for the
geological times. This is a typical step in total-evidence dating, where we
calibrate the fossils instead of the internal nodes.

calibrate

Asioxyela = unif(228,242)
Nigrimonticola = unif(152,163)
Xyelotoma = unif(152,163)
Undatoma = unif(145,152)
Dahuratoma = fixed(134)
Cleistogaster = unif(168,191)
Ghilarella = unif(113,125)
Mesorussus = unif(94,100)
Prosyntexis = unif(80,86)
Pseudoxyelocerus = fixed(182)

prset nodeagepr = calibrated

The last command nodeagepr is necessary to enable the calibrations. There
is more information in help calibrate.

pling.

The speciation, extinction and fossilization process is explicitly modeled

tmrcaxcut0complete treediversified samplingusing the fossilized birth-death (FBD) process (Stadler, 2010; Heath et al.,
2014; Gavryushkina et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). The complete tree is
generated from the birth-death process, with speciation rate λ and extinc-
tion rate µ (Figure 4). Two sampling strategies are assumed. For random
sampling, the extant taxa are sampled uniformly at random with probability
ρ, while the fossils are sampled with a constant rate ψ through time. For
diversiﬁed sampling (Zhang et al., 2016), exactly one representative taxa per
clade descending from time xcut is sampled, resulting a proportion of ρ extant
taxa sampled. The fossils are sampled with a constant rate ψ before xcut and
zero after. The observed FBD tree is resulted when all lineages without a
fossil or sampled extant descendant have been pruned. A fossil can be either
tip or ancestor of other taxa (Figure 4).

The FBD prior is enabled using

prset brlenspr = clock:fossilization

The sampling probability/proportion ρ is ﬁxed to 0.0001, based on the living
number of hymenopteran species at about 10/0.0001 = 100, 000.

prset sampleprob = 0.0001

The sampling strategy is set to be diversiﬁed, as it is arguably suitable for
this species-level dataset.

prset samplestrat = diversity

For inference, rather then operating on λ, µ and ψ, which may range from 0
to inﬁnity, we re-parametrize them as d = λ−µ (net diversiﬁcation), e = µ/λ
(turnover), and s = ψ/(µ + ψ) (fossil sampling proportion), so that the later
two parameters range from 0 to 1. The default priors for d, e, and s are:

prset speciationpr = exp(10)
prset extinctionpr = beta(1,1)
prset fossilizationpr = beta(1,1)

In order to root the tree properly, we enable the constraint HymenFossil
deﬁned above. This forces the Hymenoptera with fossils form a monophyletic
group.

prset topologypr = constraint(HymenFossil)

The FBD prior is conditioned on the root age of the tree (tmrca). It is
important to set it properly. Here we use an oﬀset exponential distribution
with minimal age 300 Ma and mean age 390 Ma.

10

prset treeagepr = offsetexp(300,390)

You may have noticed that various prior distributions for tree age (and
for calibration) are available, and the way specifying the prior parameters
as minimal age and mean age is diﬀerent from the parameterization used
elsewhere in the program. This setting is aiming to ease the user and to
assure a proper prior is speciﬁed. Several probability densities all with mean
390 and minimal 300 are shown in Figure 5, including the oﬀsetexp(300, 390)
and other candidates (oﬀsetlognormal(300, 390, 118), oﬀsetgamma(300, 390,
64), truncatednormal(300, 390, 60)).

Here I mention that there is another tree prior, the uniform prior

(clock:uniform) (Ronquist et al., 2012a), that ﬁts in the total-evidence
dating framework. The model assumes that the internal nodes are draw from
uniform distributions and the fossils are only tips of the tree (so-called tip
dating). It is also conditioned on the root age and requires setting treeagepr,
but there is no speciation-extinction-fossilization-sampling parameter.

All models and priors are set :). To see the current settings, use

showmodel

These messages will also be printed at the beginning of the run.

Now it is time to run the analysis. We ﬁrst set the Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970) without running it.

mcmcp nrun = 2 nchain = 4 ngen = 500000 samplefr = 100
mcmcp filename = hym.te printfr = 1000 diagnfr = 5000

This setting uses 2 independent runs and 4 chains (1 cold and 3 heated) per
run for 500,000 iterations, and samples every 100 iterations. The output ﬁle
names will be hym.te.∗. The chain states will be printed to screen every
1000 iterations. The convergence diagnostics (acceptance ratios and average
standard deviation of split frequencies (ASDSF)) will be printed every 5000
iterations. See help mcmc for other default settings that you may want to
change as well.

To run the MCMC, just type

mcmc

then you will see the log likelihoods printed to the screen, with [ ] for the
cold chain and ( ) for the hot, and the time left to ﬁnish.

The ASDSF is decreasing slowly toward 0, indicating the tree topologies
sampled from diﬀerent runs are getting similar and converging to the same
(stationary) distribution. We stop the run by typing no when prompted.
Then at the end, it will print the chain swap information.

To summarize the results, we use

sump
sumt

First we look at the outputs from sump. The likelihood traces for the two
runs are mixed together, this is also a good indication of convergence. It also
helps us to determine the number of burnin. By default, 25% of the samples
are discarded. This can be changed by sump burninfrac = 0.4, say. The
traces are followed by a table of the parameter estimates. Since MCMC is
sampling correlated samples, the eﬀective sample size (ESS) is smaller than
the actual number of samples (500000/100=5000 in this example). Ideally
ESS should larger than 200 for all parameters to make good estimates. We
do not run longer for this tutorial, but note that we can increase the number
of iterations and append to the current samples.

mcmc ngen=1000000 append=yes

Then go the the outputs from sumt. It ﬁrst lists the taxon bipartitions
and the corresponding IDs. The root ID is 0; the extant taxa IDs are 1 to
10; the fossil IDs are 11 to 20. The following summaries are matched to the
bipartition IDs. The tree is printed at the end.

The consensus tree including all fossils is highly unresolved due to uncer-
tainty in the placement of the fossils. In order to display the ages clearly, we

13

remove the fossils and redraw an extant taxa tree. The output ﬁlename is
changed to avoid overwriting the existing ones.

delete fossils
sumt output = hym.rf

1.4 Node dating

In node dating, we calibrate internal nodes instead of fossils. The calibration
priors are derived from second interpretation of the fossil record. Thus we
remove the fossils, the morphological characters of fossils are not used.

delete fossils
exclude 24 130 168

Then we calibrate the root, and another two internal nodes. These three

probability densities are shown in Figure 6.

calibrate

root = offsetexp(300,390)
Tenthredinidae = offsetgamma(100,150,25)
CepSirOruApo = truncatednormal(140,175,25)

prset nodeagepr = calibrated

We still use the FBD prior but ﬁx the fossilization rate to 0 (no fossil sam-
pling). The sampling strategy (diversiﬁed) and sampling proportion (0.0001)
are not changed.

prset fossilizationpr = fixed(0)

Alternatively, we can use the uniform tree prior: clock:uniform. Then we
do not need to specify the speciation-extinction-fossilization-sampling priors.
It is important to force the calibrated node to be monophyletic, and

enable the constraints using

prset topologypr = constraint(Hymenoptera,

Tenthredinidae,CepSirOruApo)

The Hymenoptera constraint helps to root the tree properly.

We change the output ﬁlename to avoid overwriting existing ones. We
also need to reset the starting values, as this node dating run is continued
after the total-evidence dating run in the same session.

150, 25) in MrBayes), and truncatednormal(140, 175, 25).

1.5 Batch mode

In practice, instead of typing commands line by line in MrBayes, we usually
write the commands in ﬁle, either after the data block as in this example,
or in separate ﬁles. Each command should end with a ;. Texts in a pair
of [ ] is a comment, and is ignored by the program. Below is an example

1.6 A non-clock analysis

Before looking at the results, we do a non-clock analysis without assuming
molecular clock, to compare the tree with the relaxed clock tree. The branch
lengths are measured in expected substitutions per site. This is a typical
analysis most people do using MrBayes.

We do not use fossils either, and do not constrain the topology so that
they are uniformly distributed. The evolutionary model is kept the same but
the setting for clock rate is ignored.

delete fossils
prset brlenspr = uncons:gammadir(1,1,1,1)
prset topologypr = uniform

mcmc

Note the prior for branch lengths is a gamma-Dirichlet(αT , βT , α, c) prior
(Rannala et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). The prior assigns a gamma(αT , βT )
distribution for the tree length (sum of branch lengths), and a Dirichlet(α, c)
prior for the proportion of branch lengths to the tree length. In the Dirichlet,
the parameter for external branches is α and for internal branches is αc, so
that the prior ratio between internal and external branch is c. In this case,
we assign gamma(1, 1) (i.e. exponential(1), cf. Figure 1) for the tree length
and uniform Dirichlet for the proportions.

The gamma-Dirichlet (compound Dirichlet) prior was shown to help avoid-
ing overestimation of tree length (Zhang et al., 2012) and is now the default
prior in MrBayes (after v3.2.3).
It was independent and identically dis-
tributed (i.i.d.) exponential(10) for each branch length before. For this 10
extant taxa example, the prior distributions for the tree length and for each
branch length are shown in Figure 7. The gamma-Dirichlet prior appears
less informative and more ﬂexiable than the i.i.d. exp(10).

2 Summarize the results

The posterior estimates on the screen are also output to ﬁles, with names
speciﬁed using the commands above, each with a particular extension. These
ﬁles can be opened using a plain-text editor.
The partition rate multipliers mi are in ﬁle hym.*.pstat. The ﬁrst and
second codon positions (m{3}) evolve much slower than the third codon po-
sition (m{4}). The morphology (m{1}) and 16S (m{2}) partitions evolve at
similar rate.

There are many tools to visualize the trees in ﬁle hym.*.con.tre. Here
I use FigTree http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/. It is very
compatible with the consensus tree format output from MrBayes. There are
various options on the left panel of FigTree to adjust the display.

The clock trees from total-evidence dating and node dating under diver-
siﬁed FBD prior and IGR model are shown in Figure 8. The ages of root and
hymenopteran crown are shown in Table 1. These estimates match the corre-
sponding node bars in Figure 8. The HPD intervals are in ﬁle hym.*.vstat.
The bipartition ID of age{all}[.] is in hym.*.parts. The ID for root is 0

under a) i.i.d. exponential(10) prior and b) gamma-Dirichlet(1, 1, 1, 1) prior.
The sum of n i.i.d. gamma(α, β) is gamma(nα, β), and the proportion to
the sum is Dirichlet(α). Thus the sum of n = 2 × 10 − 3 = 17 i.i.d. exp(10)
(gamma(1, 10)) is gamma-Dirichlet(17, 10, 1, 1). Under gamma-Dirichlet(1,
1, 1, 1), the priors for branch lengths are i.i.d. but not exactly gamma.

the outgroup and fossils (.*********).

Comparing the non-clock tree (Figure 9) with the clock trees (Figure 8),
it is obvious that the evolutionary rate is not constant over time. The Xyela
and Onycholyda lineages evolve much slower than the Orussus and Vespidae
clade, and there are indeed dramatic rate changes between adjacent branches.
The IGR model is thus presumably more suitable than the autocorrelated
TK02 model.

The ages inferred from the total-evidence dating are slightly younger than
those from the node dating under the IGR model (Figure 8), with relatively
narrower credibility intervals. The FBD model in the total-evidence dating
approach models the fossilization (and sampling) process explicitly and incor-
porates all available information from fossil record. In comparison, the node
dating approach discards the fossil morphologies and stratigraphic times, but
uses second interpretation of the fossil record as node calibration distribu-
tions. Thus the total-evidence dating approach appears more objective and
rigorous, and provides an ideal platform for exploring and further improving
the models used for Bayesian divergence-time estimation.

Nevertheless, the results from this truncated small dataset are mainly for
demonstration of MrBayes’ functionalities. For more results and discussions
using the whole data, please see Ronquist et al. (2012a); Zhang et al. (2016).
