ON THE CHOW RING OF CERTAIN RATIONAL COHOMOLOGY TORI

ZHI JIANG AND QIZHENG YIN

Abstract. Let f : X → A be an abelian cover from a complex algebraic variety with
quotient singularities to an abelian variety. We show that f ∗ induces an isomorphism
between the rational cohomology rings H •(A, Q) and H •(X, Q) if and only if f ∗ induces
an isomorphism between the Chow rings with rational coeﬃcients CH•(A)Q and CH•(X)Q.

1. Rational cohomology tori and the Chow ring

A complex algebraic variety X is called a rational cohomology torus if X is normal and

H •(X, Q) ≃ ∧•H 1(X, Q).

In [DJLW], the authors studied properties of rational cohomology tori. They showed that if
X is a rational cohomology torus, then there exists a ﬁnite cover aX : X → A to an abelian
variety such that a∗
X : H •(A, Q) → H •(X, Q) is an isomorphism. The morphism aX is the
universal morphism to an abelian variety and is called the Albanese morphism of X.

It is a general principle that Hodge structures control Chow groups. Hence it makes sense

to ask the following question.

Question 1.1. Let f : X → A be a ﬁnite morphism from a variety with quotient singu-
larities to an abelian variety. Assume that f ∗ : H •(A, Q) → H •(X, Q) is an isomorphism.
Does f ∗ induce an isomorphism of Chow rings with rational coeﬃcients between A and X?

A variety is said to have quotient singularities if it is ´etale-locally the quotient of a smooth
variety by a ﬁnite group. For such varieties there is a well-deﬁned intersection theory with
Q-coeﬃcients (see [V]). Note that a smooth rational cohomology torus cannot be of general
type, but in every dimension > 2, there exist rational cohomology tori of general type with
quotient singularities (see [DJLW]). Hence it is more interesting to consider the Chow ring
of rational cohomology tori with quotient singularities.

Despite several constraints on aX found in [DJLW], we do not have a thorough classiﬁ-
cation of rational cohomology tori. Hence it seems diﬃcult to answer the above question
in general. But all known rational cohomology tori are actually abelian covers of abelian
varieties (see [DJLW, Section 4]). The goal of this note is to answer aﬃrmatively the above
question in the case of abelian covers of abelian varieties.

Let f : X → A be an abelian cover from a normal variety to an abelian variety with

Galois group G. Then we have (see for instance [P])

We have a decomposition

Theorem 1.2. Let f : X → A be an abelian cover from a variety with quotient singularities
to an abelian variety with Galois group G. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(1) X is a rational cohomology torus;
(2) hi(A, Lχ) = 0 for all i ∈ Z and non-trivial χ ∈ G∗;
(3) [ΓX

χ ] = 0 ∈ CHdim X(X × X)C for all non-trivial χ ∈ G∗; in particular,

f ∗ : CH•(A)Q → CH•(X)Q

is an isomorphism.

The implications (1) ⇒ (2) and (3) ⇒ (1) are straightforward.

Indeed, if X is a ra-
tional cohomology torus, then f ∗ : H •(A, Q) → H •(X, Q) is an isomorphism of Q-Hodge
structures. We have for all i ∈ Z,

hi(A, OA) = h0,i(A) = h0,i(X) = hi(X, OX) = X

χ ) = 0 for all i ∈ Z and non-trivial χ ∈ G∗. We also have hi(A, Lχ) = 0 by

If [ΓX

χ ] = 0 ∈ CHdim X(X × X)C for all non-trivial χ ∈ G∗, then by applying [ΓX
χ ]
to H •(X, C), we ﬁnd H •(X, C) = H •(X, C)G. Hence f ∗ : H •(A, Q) → H •(X, Q) is an
isomorphism and X is a rational cohomology torus.

The proof of (2) ⇒ (3) will occupy the next section.

Remark 1.3. Since Lχ is semi-ample (see Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 2.2), con-
dition (2) in Theorem 1.2 is also equivalent to the condition that h0(A, Lχ) = 0 for all
non-trivial χ ∈ G∗. Hence, under the assumption of Theorem 1.2, we know that X is a
rational cohomology torus if and only if pg(X) = 1.

2. Proof of Theorem 1.2

Lemma 2.1. Let A be an abelian variety and let t : A → A be the translation by a torsion
element. Then [ΓA
is the graph of t and ∆A is
the diagonal.

t ] − [∆A] = 0 ∈ CHdim A(A × A)Q, where ΓA

Proposition 2.2. Let ρ : Y → A be a cyclic cover from a variety with quotient singularities
to an abelian variety with Galois group H. We write

ρ∗OY = M

L−1
χ .

If hi(A, Lχ) = 0 for all i ∈ Z and non-trivial χ ∈ H ∗, then for all non-trivial χ ∈ H ∗,

χ∈H ∗

X

h∈H

χ−1(h)[ΓY

h ] = 0 ∈ CHdim Y (Y × Y )C.

Proof. We proceed by induction on the dimension of Y . The statement in dimension 0 is
trivial. We then assume that Proposition 2.2 holds in dimensions < dim Y .

Step 1. Reduction to lower dimensions.

Let χ be a generator of H ∗. Since hi(A, Lχ) = 0 for all i ∈ Z, the line bundle Lχ is not
ample. Let K denote the neutral component of the morphism ϕLχ : A → Pic0(A) induced
by Lχ, and let p : A → B be the quotient by K. Then we have

Lχ = p∗H + Q,

where H is an ample line bundle on B and Q is a torsion line bundle such that Q|K 6= OK
(see for instance [BL, Section 3.3]). As ρ is a cyclic cover and χ is a generator of H ∗, for each
k ∈ Z, there exists an eﬀective divisor Dk whose components are irreducible components of
the branched divisor D such that

kLχ = Lχk + Dk.

Moreover, for m = |H|, we know that mLχ = Dm and that Dm − D is eﬀective (see [P]).
In particular, we have D = p∗DB for some ample divisor DB on B.

Consider the Stein factorization of the natural morphism ϕ = p ◦ ρ : Y → B,

A general ﬁber of ϕ′ is an ´etale cover of K, which is an abelian variety that we denote by eK.

Hence ϕ′ is the Iitaka ﬁbration of Y in the sense of [K, Theorem 13].

ϕ : Y

ϕ′
−→ Z

ϕ′′
−→ B.

Let Y ′ := Z ×B A. Then we have a factorization
−→ Y ′ ρ′′

ρ : Y

−→ A.

Both ρ′ and ρ′′ are cyclic covers with respective Galois groups H ′ ⊂ H and H ′′ := H/H ′.
Hence the morphism ϕ′′ : Z → B is also an H ′′-cover. Moreover, we write

OZ = M

ϕ′′

L−1

ι∈H ′′∗

Then we have p∗Lι,Z = Lχι, where χι is the induced character of H. Hence H i(B, Lι,Z) = 0
for all i ∈ Z and non-trivial ι ∈ H ′′∗.

Further, we show that Y ′ and Z have quotient singularities. Recall from [V, Proposi-
tion 2.8] that Y is the coarse moduli space of a smooth Deligne-Mumford stack Y (called
the canonical stack). The morphism Y → Y is an isomorphism away from a locus of codi-
mension ≥ 2. Since Y is normal, the action of H ′ on Y induces an action on Y . The quotient
Y ′ = Y /H ′ is the coarse moduli space of the smooth Deligne-Mumford stack [Y /H ′], and
hence has quotient singularities.

We take a quotient A → K such that A → B × K is an isogeny. Each connected
component of a general ﬁber of the induced morphism Y ′ → K is an ´etale cover of Z.
Hence Z also has quotient singularities.

Since dim Z < dim Y , the induction hypothesis implies that for all non-trivial ι ∈ H ′′∗,

X

h∈H ′′

ι−1(h)[ΓZ

h ] = 0 ∈ CHdim Z(Z × Z)C.

Step 2. Proof that Ph∈H ′′ ι−1(h)[ΓY ′

h ] = 0 ∈ CHdim Y ′

(Y ′ × Y ′)C for all non-trivial ι ∈ H ′′∗.

Consider the quotient A → K such that A → B × K is an isogeny with Galois group L.
Then the induced morphism π : Y ′ = Z ×B A → Z × K is also an ´etale cover with Galois
group L.

Note that for all h ∈ H ′′,

Step 3. Proof that Ph∈H ′ χ−1(h)[ΓY

By Kawamata’s theorem [K, Theorem 13], there exists an ´etale cover µ : eY → Y with
Stein factorization of the natural morphism ν = ϕ′ ◦ µ : eY → Z,

Galois group J induced by an ´etale cover of A, such that the following holds: consider the

(Y ′ × Y ′)C.

Then we have eY ≃ bZ × eK with ν ′ the projection, J acts on bZ faithfully and on eK faithfully
by translation, and Y ≃ (bZ × eK)/J. We put everything into a commutative diagram:

Since µ is induced by an ´etale cover of A, we know that ρ′ ◦ µ : eY → Y ′ is still an abelian

cover. It is clear that the Galois group of ρ ◦ µ is J × H and hence the Galois group of ρ′ ◦ µ
is J × H ′. Let q : J × H ′ → H ′ be the projection.

Consider the morphism µ × µ : eY × eY → Y × Y . Note that for all h ∈ H ′,

(µ × µ)∗[ΓY

h ] = X

[Γ

eY

g ] ∈ CHdim eY (eY × eY )Q.

g∈q−1(h)

Hence for all non-trivial χ ∈ H ′∗,

h ]) = X

h∈H ′

(g,h)∈J ×H ′

χ−1(h)[Γ

Under the isomorphism eY ≃ bZ × eK, we have

[Γ

(g,h)] = [Γ

(g,h)] ∈ CHdim Y (bZ × bZ × eK × eK)Q.

Then we ﬁnd

(g,h)] = 0 ∈ CHdim eK( eK × eK)C,

χ−1(h)[ΓY

h ] = 0 ∈ CHdim Y (Y × Y )C.

Step 4. Conclusion.

h∈H ′

Let χ ∈ H ∗ be a non-trivial character. If the restriction of χ to H ′ is trivial, then χ is

the pull-back of a non-trivial character ι of H ′′. As before,

X

h∈H

χ−1(h)[ΓY

h ] = (ρ′ × ρ′)∗( X

h∈H ′′

ι−1(h)[ΓY ′

h ]) ∈ CHdim Y (Y × Y )C.

By Step 2, we see that Ph∈H χ−1(h)[ΓY

h ] = 0 ∈ CHdim Y (Y × Y )C.

If the restriction of χ to H ′ is non-trivial, we take a subset V of H consisting of repre-

sentatives of each coset of H ′. Then we have

h∈H

h ] = (X

h∈H ′

h ]) ◦ (X

g∈V

χ−1(h)[ΓY

χ−1(g)[ΓY

By Step 3, we also know that Ph∈H χ−1(h)[ΓY

h ] = 0 ∈ CHdim Y (Y × Y )C.

(cid:3)

We are now ready to prove Theorem 1.2. Let χ ∈ G∗ be a non-trivial character. Consider

G′ := Ker(χ : G → C∗) ⊂ G.

We take X ′ := X/G′ which has quotient singularities (see Step 1 in the proof of Proposi-
tion 2.2), and we have a factorization

f : X

f ′

−→ X ′ f ′′

−→ A.

Then f ′′ is a cyclic cover with Galois group G′′ := G/G′ ⊂ C∗. Moreover, the character χ
is the pull-back of a non-trivial character ι of G′′. It is straightforward to verify that the
assumption of Proposition 2.2 is satisﬁed by X ′ and G′′. Hence

(X ′ × X ′)C.
