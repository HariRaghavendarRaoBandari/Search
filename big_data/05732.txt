ON THE BOUNDEDNESS OF THRESHOLD

OPERATORS IN L1[0, 1] WITH RESPECT TO THE

HAAR BASIS

S. J. DILWORTH, S. GOGYAN, DENKA KUTZAROVA,

AND TH. SCHLUMPRECHT

Abstract. We prove a near-unconditionality property for the
normalized Haar basis of L1[0, 1].

1. Introduction

Let (ei) be a semi-normalized basis for a Banach space X. For a ﬁnite

subset A ⊂ N, let PA(Pi aiei) :=Pi∈A aiei denote the projection from

X onto the span of basis vectors indexed by A. Recall that (ei) is an
unconditional basis if there exists a constant C such that, for all ﬁnite
A ⊂ N, kPAk ≤ C.

We say that (ei) is near-unconditional if for all 0 < δ ≤ 1 there exists

a constant C(δ) such that for all x = P aiei satisfying the normaliza-

tion condition sup |ai| ≤ 1, and for all ﬁnite A ⊆ {i : |ai| ≥ δ},

kPA(x)k ≤ C(δ)kxk.

Every unconditional basis is near-unconditional, and it is easy to check
that a near-unconditional basis is unconditional if and only if C(δ) can
be chosen to be independent of δ.

It was proved in [1] that a basis is near-unconditional if and only if the

thresholding operators Gδ(x) := P|ai|≥δ aiei satisfy, for some constant

C1(δ),

kGδ(x)k ≤ C1(δ)kxk,

and that the class of near-unconditional bases strictly contains the im-
portant class of quasi-greedy bases, deﬁned by Konyagin and Temlyakov

[5] as the class of bases for which C1(δ) may be chosen to be indepen-
dent of δ.

Elton [2] proved that every semi-normalized weakly null sequence
contains a subsequence which is a near-unconditional basis for its closed
linear span. On the other hand, Maurey and Rosenthal [6] gave an ex-
ample of a semi-normalized weakly null sequence with no unconditional
subsequence.

By a theorem of Paley [7], the Haar system is an unconditional basis
of Lp[0, 1] for 1 < p < ∞. For p = 1, on the other hand, a well-known
example (see e.g.
[4]) shows that the normalized Haar basis is not
unconditional. The same example, which we now recall, also shows
that the Haar basis fails to be near-unconditional.

Deﬁne h0 = 1[0,1], and for k ∈ N, set

Observe that for any n ∈ N

h(k)

1 = 2k−1(cid:0)1[0,2−k) − 1[2−k,21−k)(cid:1).

and for some constant c > 0

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)
So, setting fn = h0 +P2n

k=1 h(k)

1 , and An = {0, 2, 4, . . . , 2n}, we have
kfnk = 1 and kPAn(fn)k ≥ cn, which witnesses the failure of near-
unconditionality with δ = 1. In this example the nonzero coeﬃcients
of fn are equal and they lie along the left branch of the Haar system.
Our main result shows that in a certain sense every example of the
failure of near-unconditionality must be of this type.

We state our main result precisely below but the idea is as follows.
Suppose that the Haar coeﬃcients of f ∈ L1[0, 1], δ, and A are as stated
in the deﬁnition of near-unconditionality. We show that there is an
enlargement B ⊇ A such that kPB(f )k ≤ C(δ)kf k and we provide an
explicit construction of B. Roughly speaking, the ‘added’ coeﬃcients in
B\A are those which lie along a segment of a branch of the Haar system
such that the coeﬃcient of the maximal element of the segment (with
respect to the usual tree ordering) belongs to A and all the coeﬃcients
of f along the segment are approximately equal to each other (to within
some prescribed multiplicative factor of 1 + ε). For fn and the sets An,
the enlargements are Bn = {0, 1, 2, . . . , 2n}, and so PBn(fn) = fn,
which renders the example harmless. Here the enlargement is as large

BOUNDEDNESS OF THRESHOLD OPERATORS IN L1

as possible. The interest of our result, however, resides in the fact that,
for certain f and A, the enlargement will often be trivial, i.e., B = A,
or quite small.

The normalized Haar basis is not a quasi-greedy basis of L1[0, 1], i.e.,
the Thresholding Greedy Algorithm fails to converge for certain initial
vectors. In a remarkable paper [3] Gogyan exhibited a weak threshold-
ing algorithm which produces uniformly bounded approximants con-
verging to f for all f ∈ L1[0, 1]. The proof of our main theorem uses
results and techniques from [3]. We have chosen to reprove some of
these results to achieve what we hope is a self-contained and accessible
presentation.

2. Notation and basic facts

We denote the dyadic subintervals of [0, 1] by D, and put D = D ∪
{[0, 2]}. We think of D and D being partially ordered by “⊂”. We
denote by I + and I − the left and the right half subinterval of I ∈ D,
respectively. I + and I − are then the direct successors of I, while the
set

succ(I) = {J ∈ D : J ( I}

is called the successors of I ∈ D. The predecessors of an I ∈ D is the
set

pred(I) = {J ∈ D : J ) I}.

It follows that the pred(I) is a linearly ordered set. If I ⊂ J are in D
we put

[I, J] = {K ∈ D : I ⊆ K ⊆ J}.

Let S ⊂ D be ﬁnite and not empty. Then S contains elements I
which are minimal in S, i.e., there is no J ∈ S for which J ( I. We
put in this case

S ′ = S \ {I ∈ S : I is minimal in S}.

Inductively we deﬁne S(n) for n ∈ N0, by S(0) = S, and, assuming S(n)
. Since S was assumed to be
ﬁnite, there is an n ∈ N, for which S (n) = ∅, and we deﬁne the order of
S by

has been deﬁned, we put S (n+1) =(cid:0)S(n)(cid:1)′

ord(S) = min{n ∈ N : S (n) = ∅} − 1 = max{n ∈ N : S (n) 6= ∅}

and for I ∈ S we deﬁne the order of I in S to be the (unique) natural
number m ∈ [0, ord(S)], for which I ∈ S (m) \ S (m+1), and we denote it
by ord(I, S).

(hI : I ∈ D) denotes the L1-normalized Haar basis, i.e.,
h[0,2] = 1[0,1] and hI = 2n(1I + − 1I −), if I ∈ D, with m(I) = 2−n,

If f ∈ L1[0, 1] we denote the

From the normalization of (hI) it follows that

For f ∈ L1[0, 1] the support of f with respect to the Haar basis is the
set

suppH(f ) = {I ∈ D : cI(f ) 6= 0}.

We will use the following easy inequalities for f ∈ L1[0, 1] and I, J ∈

D, with J ⊆ I, i.e.,

(3) kf kI :=ZI

For a ﬁnite set S ⊂ D we denote by PS the canonical projection from

L1[0, 1] onto the span of (hI : I ∈ S):

cI(f )hI.

If S is coﬁnite PS is deﬁned by Id − PD\S. We will use the fact that
the Haar system is a monotone basis with respect to any order, which
is consistent with the partial order “⊂”. It follows therefore that the
projections

SI : L1[0, 1] → L1[0, 1], f 7→ f −XJ⊆I

cJ (f )hJ,

are bounded linear projections with kSIk ≤ 1, for all I ∈ D. Moreover
we observe that

Remark 2. The proof of Theorem 1 yields an explicit, albeit laborious,
description of E.

3. Proof of the main Result

We will ﬁrst state and prove several Lemmas.

Lemma 3. Let f ∈ L1[0, 1] and let K, J and I be elements of D, and
assume that K is a direct successor of J, which is a direct successor of
I. Then

|cI(f )| − |cJ (f )|

kf kI\K ≥(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Proof. We ﬁrst note that from the monotonicity property of the Haar
basis we deduce that
(7)

kf kI\J =(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) XL∈pred(I\J)
≥(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) XL∈pred(I\J)

and similarly we obtain

cL(f )hL|I\J + cI\J (f )hI\J + XL∈succ(I\J)
cL(f )hL|I\J(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

= kSI\J (f )kI\J

cL(f )hL(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

(8)

kf kJ\K ≥ kSJ\K(f )kJ\K.

SI(f ) takes a constant value H on I. Denote by a the value of cI(f )hI
on I \J and denote by b the value of cJ (f )hJ on J \K, and let δ = m(I).
Then we compute

Our claim follows then if we notice that |a|δ = |cI(f )| and δ|b| =
2|cJ(f )|.
(cid:3)

We iterate Lemma 3 to obtain the following result.

Lemma 4. Let f ∈ L1[0, 1] and let K, J and I be elements of D, and
assume that K is a successor of J, which is a successor of I. Then

kf kI\K ≥(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|cI(f )| − |cJ (f )|

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Proof. First we can, without loss of generality, assume that K is a
direct successor of J, we write [K, I] as [K, I] = {In+1, In, In−1, . . . I0},
with K = In+1 ( In = J ( In−1 ( . . . I0 = I, so that Im+1 is a direct
successor of Im for m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n. From Lemma 3 we obtain

Then

(10)

In order to prove Lemma 5 we will ﬁrst show the following observa-

tion.

Proposition 6. Let F ⊂ D, and deﬁne the following partition of F
into sets F0, F1 and F2

F0 = {I ∈ F : I is minimal in F } = {I ∈ F : succ(I) ∩ F = ∅},
F1 = {I ∈ F : succ(I) ∩ F has exactly one maximal element}, and
F2 = {I ∈ F : succ(I) ∩ F has at least two maximal element}.

Then

(11)

|F2| < |F0|.

Proof. In order to verify (11) we ﬁrst show for I ∈ F2 that

(12)

(cid:12)(cid:12){J ∈ F2 : J ⊆ I}(cid:12)(cid:12) <(cid:12)(cid:12){J ∈ F0 : J ⊂ I}(cid:12)(cid:12).

Assuming that (12) is true for all I ∈ F2, we let I1, I2, . . . Il be the
maximal elements of F2. Since the Ij’s are pairwise disjoint, observe
that

|F2| =

Xj=1(cid:12)(cid:12){I ∈ F2 : I ⊆ Ij}(cid:12)(cid:12) <

If
n = 1 then I must have at least two successor, say J1 and J2 in F
which are incomparable, and thus there are elements I1, I2 ∈ F0 so
that I1 ⊂ J1 and I2 ⊂ J2. Assume that our claim is true for n, and

Xj=1(cid:12)(cid:12){J ∈ F0 : J ⊂ Ij}(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ |F0|.
We now prove (12) by induction on n = (cid:12)(cid:12){J ∈ F2 : J ⊆ I}(cid:12)(cid:12).
assume that (cid:12)(cid:12){J ∈ F2 : J ⊆ I}(cid:12)(cid:12) = n + 1 ≥ 2. We denote the maximal

elements of {J ∈ F2 : J ( I}, by I1, I2, . . . Im. Either m ≥ 2, then
it follows from the induction hypothesis, and the fact that I1,I2, . . . Im
are incomparable, that

Or m = 1, and if ˜I is the only maximal element of {J ∈ F2 : J ( I},
then by the deﬁnition of F2 there must be a J0 ∈ F0 with J0 ⊂ I \ ˜I,
and we deduce from our induction hypothesis that

|{J ∈ F2 : J ⊆ I}| = 1 +(cid:12)(cid:12){J ∈ F2 : J ⊆ ˜I}(cid:12)(cid:12)

which ﬁnishes the proof of the induction step, and the proof of (12). (cid:3)

< 1 + |{J ∈ F0 : J ⊆ ˜I}| ≤(cid:12)(cid:12){J ∈ F0 : J ⊆ I}(cid:12)(cid:12),

Proof of Lemma 5. Assume now that α, ε > 0 and f, g ∈ L1[0, 1], and
F ⊂ D are given satisfying (a), (b). Let F0, F1, and F2 the subsets of
F introduced in Proposition 6. We distinguish between two cases.
Case 1. |F0| ≥ 1

6 |F |.

Fix I ∈ F0, and let J ∈ succ(I) be chosen so that condition (b) is

satisﬁed. It follows then from condition (a) and (3)

kf + gkI ≥ kf + gkJ ≥ |cJ (f )| ≥ α.

Since all the elements in F0 are disjoint it follows that

Case 2. |F0| < 1

6|F |.

Applying (11) we obtain that

|F1| = |F | − |F0| − |F2| > |F | − 2|F0| >

Fix I ∈ F1, and let J ∈ succ(I) satisfy the conditions in (c), and let
˜I, be the unique maximal element of succ(I) ∩ F . It follows that J ( I
and, since by condition (b) ˜I 6∈ [J, I], we deduce that J 6⊂ ˜I which
implies that either ˜I ( J or ˜I ∩ J = ∅. In the ﬁrst case we deduce from
Lemma 4, and condition (b) that

(cid:3)

In order to formulate our next step we introduce the following Sym-
metrization Operators L1 and L2. For that assume that f ∈ L1[0, 1]
and I ∈ D. We deﬁne the following two functions L1(f, I) and L2(f, I)
in L1[0, 1]. For ξ ∈ [0, 1] we put

L1(f, I)(ξ) =(f (ξ)
L2(f, I)(ξ) =(f (ξ)

2 )

f(cid:0)ξ − m(I)
f(cid:0)ξ + m(I)
2 (cid:1)

if ξ 6∈ I −
if ξ ∈ I −

if ξ 6∈ I +
if ξ ∈ I +

Note that L1(f, I) restricted to I − is a shift of f restricted to I +, and
vice versa L2(f, I) restricted to I + is a shift of f restricted to I −.

We will use this symmetrization only for f ∈ L1[0, 1] and I ∈ D, for
which cI(f ) = 0, We observe in that case that letting f ′ = L1(f, I) or
f ′ = L2(f, I), and any J ∈ D

if J ⊂ I − and f ′ = L2(f, I),
if J ⊂ I − and f ′ = L1(f, I)
if J ⊂ I + and f ′ = L2(f, I).

Moreover it follows that

(14)

(cid:13)(cid:13)L1(f, I)(cid:13)(cid:13) = kf k + ∆(f, I) and (cid:13)(cid:13)L2(f, I)(cid:13)(cid:13) = kf k − ∆(f, I),

with ∆(f, I) = kf kI + − kf kI −.

Lemma 7. Assume that f, g ∈ L1[0, 1], so that suppH(f ), suppH(g) ⊂
D and I ∈ D are given. Suppose that cI(f ) = cI(g) = 0 and that the
following properties hold:

a) suppH(f ) ∩ suppH(g) = ∅,
b) kf k > 0, and thus, by (a), also kf + gk > 0.

10

DILWORTH, GOGYAN, KUTZAROVA, AND SCHLUMPRECHT

Then for either f ′ = L1(f, I) and g′ = L1(g, I), or f ′ = L2(f, I) and
g′ = L2(g, I) it follows that

(15)

(16)

suppH(f ′) ∩ suppH(g′) = ∅ and I 6∈ suppH(f ′) ∪ suppH(g′);
for any J ∈ D it follows that

cJ (f ′) ∈ {cI(f ′) : I ∈ supp(f )} ∪ {0} and
cJ (g′) ∈ {cI (g′) : I ∈ supp(g)} ∪ {0},

(17)

kf ′ + g′k > 0 and

kf k

kf + gk

≤

kf ′k

kf ′ + g′k

.

Proof. It follows immediately from (13) that (16) and (15) are satisﬁed
for either of the possible choices of f ′ and g′.

To satisfy (17) we will ﬁrst consider the case that (f + g)|[0,1]\I + ≡ 0.
In this case it follows from (a) that cJ (f ) = cJ(g) = 0 for all J ∈ D,
with J ⊆ [0, 1] \ I +, and thus by (b) f |I + 6≡ 0 and (g + f )|I + 6≡ 0. If
we choose f ′ = L1(f, I) and g′ = L1(g, I) we obtain that kf ′ + g′k > 0,
kf ′k = 2kf k and kf ′ + g′k = 2kf + gk.

A similar argument can be made if (f + g)|[0,1]\I − ≡ 0.
If neither of the two previously discussed cases occurs we conclude

that

kf +gk = kf +gk[0,1]\I + kf +gkI + + kf +gkI − > kf +gkI + − kf +gkI −

and

kf +gk = kf +gk[0,1]\I + kf +gkI + + kf +gkI − > kf +gkI − − kf +gkI +

which implies by (14) that in either of the two possible choices for f ′
and g′ it follows that kf ′ + g′k > 0.

Finally, if ∆(f, I)kf + gk ≥ ∆(f + g, I)kf k, we choose f ′ = L1(f, I)

and g′ = L1(f, I) and note that since in this case we have

(kf k + ∆(f, I))kf + gk ≥ (kf + gk + ∆(f + g, I))kf k,

it follows that

kf ′k

kf ′ + g′k

=

kf k + ∆(f, I)

kf + gk + ∆(f + g, I)

kf k

kf + gk

.

If ∆(f, I)kf + gk < ∆(f + g)kf k and thus −∆(f, I)kf + gk > −∆(f +

in this case we have

which ﬁnishes the veriﬁcation of (17) and the proof of our claim. (cid:3)

Assume now that f , g ⊂ L1[0, 1], kf k > 0, are such that suppH(f )
and suppH (g) are ﬁnite and disjoint subsets of D. We also assume that

F (f ) = {I ∈ D : cI(f ) = 0 but cI +(f ) 6= 0 or cI −(f ) 6= 0}

and make the following assumption

(20)

suppH (g) ∩ F (f ) = ∅.

Let F (f ) = (Ii)n

i=1, where m(I1) ≤ m(I2) ≤ · · · ≤ m(In). First
‘symmetrize’ the pair (f, g) on I1 to obtain a pair (f1, g1) satisfying
kf k/kf + gk ≤ kf1k/kf1 + g1k. Note that F (f1) = F (f ). Now sym-
metrize (f1, g1) on I2 to obtain (f2, g2) satisfying kf1k/kf1 + g1k ≤
kf2k/kf2 + g2k. Note that if I ∈ F (f2) satisﬁes m(I) < m(I2), then
(f2, g2) on I is a ‘copy’ of (f1, g1) on I1. Hence, f2 and g2 are auto-
matically symmetric on I. On the other hand, if I ∈ F (f2) satisﬁes
m(I) ≥ m(I2) then I = Ij for some j ≥ 2. Now symmetrize (f2, g2) on
I2 to obtain (f3, g3) satisfying kf2k/kf2 + g2k ≤ kf3k/kf3 + g3k. Note
that if I ∈ F (f3) satisﬁes m(I) < m(I3) then (f3, g3) on I is a copy of
(f2, g2) on I1 or I2. Hence f3 and g3 are automatically symmetric on I.
Continuing in this way, we ﬁnally obtain, after symmetrizing on In, a
pair (fn, gn) such that fn and gn are symmetric on each I ∈ F (fn) and
kf k/kf + gk ≤ kfnk/kfn + gnk.

Setting ˜f = fn and ˜g = fn, the following conditions hold:

(21)

(22)

c[0,2]( ˜f ) = c[0,2](˜g) = c[0,1]( ˜f ) = c[0,1](˜g) = 0,
For all I ∈ F ( ˜f ) it follows that

cI(˜g) = 0 and
˜f (x) = ˜f (x−m(I +)) and ˜g(x) = ˜g(x−m(I +)), if x ∈ I −,

(23)

suppH ( ˜f ) ∩ suppH(˜g) = ∅,

for any J ∈ D it follows that

cJ ( ˜f ) ∈ {cI(f ) : I ∈ supp(f )} ∪ {0} and
cJ (˜g) ∈ {cI(g) : I ∈ supp(g)} ∪ {0},

Lemma 8. Assume that f, g ∈ L1[0, 1] are such that suppH(f ) and
suppH(g) are ﬁnite disjoint subsets of D \ {[0, 1]}, and that suppH(g) ∩
F (f ) = ∅, where F (f ) ⊂ D, was deﬁned above. Assume moreover that
for some α > 0, we have

|cJ (f )| ≥ α, for all J ∈ suppH(f ), and
|cJ (g)| ≤ 1, for all J ∈ suppH (g).

(26)

Then

(27)

kf k ≤(cid:16) 5

Proof. Let ˜f and ˜g be the elements in L1[0, 1] constructed from f and
g as before satisfying the conditions (21), (22), (23), (24), and (25).
Note also that (24) implies that |cJ( ˜f )| ≥ α, for all J ∈ suppH( ˜f ), and
|cJ(˜g)| ≤ 1, for all J ∈ suppH(˜g).

By (25) it is enough to show (27) for ˜f and ˜g instead of f and g.
We will deduce our statement from the following

Main Claim. For all I ∈ F ( ˜f ) it follows that

(28)

k ˜f kI ≤(cid:16) 5

+ 1(cid:17)k ˜f + ˜gkI − 2α − 8.

Assuming the Main Claim we can argue as follows. Using (21) it follows

and (28) yields

that out side of J = SI∈F ( ˜f ) I ˜f is vanishing. Thus, we can choose
disjoint sets I1, I2, . . . In, in F ( ˜f ) so that ˜f vanishes outside ofSn

In order to show the Main Claim let I ∈ F ( ˜f ) and denote k =
ord(I, F ( ˜f)). We will show the inequality (28) by induction for all k.

First assume that k = 0. From (22) and (3) we obtain

(29)

k ˜f + ˜gkI = 2k ˜f + ˜gkI + ≥ 2(cid:12)(cid:12)cI +( ˜f + ˜g)(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)2cI +( ˜f )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ 2α.

13

Using (4), (23) and (27) we obtain

(30)

kSI(˜g)kI ≤ 1.

From the deﬁnition of F ( ˜f ), and the assumption that ord(cid:0)I, F ( ˜f )(cid:1) = 0,

(23) we deduce that if J ∈ suppH( ˜f ) with J ⊂ I + or J ⊂ I −, then
[J, I +] ⊂ suppH( ˜f ), or [J, I −] ⊂ suppH( ˜f ), respectively. But, using
(23), this implies that if J ∈ suppH (˜g), with J ⊂ I, then succ(J) ∩
suppH( ˜f ) = ∅. We deduce therefore from the monotonicity properties
of the Haar basis that

We therefore conclude

(by (29))

which proves our claim in the case that ord(cid:0)I, F ( ˜f )(cid:1) = 0.
Assume that (28) holds for all I ∈ F with ord(cid:0)I, F ( ˜f )(cid:1) < k, for

some k ∈ N, and assume that I ∈ F ( ˜f ) with ord(I, F ( ˜f )) = k. By
the symmetry condition in (22) the number of elements J of F ( ˜f ) for
which J ⊂ I and ord(J, F ) = k − 1 is even, half of them being subsets
of I +, the other being subsets of I −. We order therefore these sets
into J1, J2, . . . J2s, for some s ∈ N, with Ji ⊂ I + and Js+i ⊂ I −, for
i = 1, 2, . . . , s. We note that the Ji, i = 1, 2 . . ., are pairwise disjoint
and that all the J ∈ F ( ˜f ), with F ⊂ I, and ord(J, F ( ˜f )) ≤ k − 2, are
subset of some of the Ji, i = 1, 2 . . . 2s.

From our induction hypothesis we deduce that

and since for any J ∈ D, with J ⊆ D, for which cJ (φ) 6= 0, we
have [J, I +] ⊂ suppH(φ) (otherwise there would be an K ∈ F ( ˜f ) with
K ⊂ I + and K ) Ji, for some i ∈ {1, 2 . . . s}, or K ⊂ D) it follows
from the monotonicity property of the Haar system and (4) that

Theorem 9. Let h ∈ L1[0, 1], with suppH (h) ⊂ succ([0, 1]), and let

and g = h − PSε(h). We note that f and g satisfy the assumptions of
Lemma 5 with

F =(cid:8)I ∈ D : I /∈ Sε, but I + ∈ Sε or I − ∈ Sε(cid:9).

Indeed, condition (a) of Lemma 5 is clearly satisﬁed, and in order to
verify (b) let I ∈ F . Without loss of generality we can assume that
I + ∈ Sε. Thus there is a J ∈ S, with J ⊂ I, and so that J is maximal
with that property. It follows therefore from the deﬁnition of Sε that
[J, I +] ⊂ Sε, and thus [J, I] ∩ F = {I}, |cJ (f )| = |cJ (h)| ≥ α, and

|cI(g) − cJ (f )| = |cI(h) − cJ (h)| ≥ ε|cJ(f )|.

We are now in the position to prove Theorem 1.

Proof of Theorem 1. Let f ∈ L1, and ε, δ > 0. We can assume that
ε < 1
3 and that suppH(f ) ⊂ succ([0, 1]), with |cI(f )| ≤ 1, for all I ∈
suppH(f ). We choose m0 ∈ N, so that 2−m0 < δ ≤ 21−m0, which
implies that m0 ≤ log2(2/δ).

For each m = 1, 2, . . . m0, we apply Corollary 10 to the function f ,
ρ = 2−m, the set A ∩ {I ∈ D : δ < |cH(f )|}. We put Cε = 45738/ε and

B(m) = A ∩(cid:8)I ∈ D : 2m ∨ δ < |cI(f )| ≤ 21−m(cid:9) for m = 1, 2 . . . m0

3 it follows for i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3 . . . m0}, with |i − j| ≥ 2, that
ε (f ) = ∅, and, thus, that C(i) ∩ C(j) = ∅.

kPC(m)(f )k ≤ Cεl m0

We are now applying again Corollary 10 to the function g = f − PF (f )
and the set ˜A = (A ∩ {I ∈ D : δ < |cH(f )|}) \ F , and ﬁnd sets ˜C(j),
with ˜B(j) ⊂ ˜C(j) ⊂ ˜B(j)

˜B(m) = ˜A ∩(cid:8)I ∈ D : 2m ∨ δ < |cI(f )| ≤ 21−m(cid:9) for m = 1, 2 . . . m0,

so that

(cid:13)(cid:13)P ˜C(m)(g)(cid:13)(cid:13) ≤ Cεkgk for m = 1, 2 . . . m0.

(42)
We note that for every odd m in {1, 2 . . . m0} the set ˜C(m) is empty
and that therefore the ˜C(m) ’s are pairwise disjoint. We also note that
˜B(m)

Our next example provides a lower bound for the constant on the
