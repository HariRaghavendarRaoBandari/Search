Abstract

Identical particle correlations at ﬁxed multiplicity are considered by means of quantum canon-

ical ensemble of ﬁnite systems. We calculate one-particle momentum spectra and two-particle

Bose-Einstein correlation functions in the ideal gas by using recurrence relations for the partition

function. Within such a model we investigate the validity of the thermal Wick theorem and its

applicability for decomposition of the two-particle distribution function. A dependence of the Bose-

Einstein correlation parameters on the average momentum of the particle pair is also investigated.

Speciﬁcally, we present the analytical formulas that allow one to estimate the eﬀect of suppressing

the correlation functions in a ﬁnite canonical system. The results can be used for the femtoscopy

analysis of the A + A and p + p collisions with selected (ﬁxed) multiplicity.

INTRODUCTION

The correlation femtoscopy method (for reviews see, e.g., Refs. [1–3])) uses momentum

correlations of identical particles to extract information about the spatiotemporal structure

of extremely small and short-lived systems created in nucleon and nuclear collisions. The

method is grounded on the Bose-Einstein or Fermi-Dirac symmetric properties of the quan-

tum states. As in high energy nucleus-nucleus or hadron-hadron collisions most of produced

particles are pions, the Bose-Einstein correlations of two identical pions are usually analyzed

to increase the statistics of the correlation femtoscopy measurements. Inasmuch as mean

particle multiplicities increase with collision energy, one can divide whole set of high energy

collision events into subsets with ﬁxed charged particle multiplicities. In recent works [4] it

was considered even possibility of the single-event correlation femtoscopy – at least, theo-

retically, since in reality not enough pairs remain for a statistically meaningful analysis in

a single event. Typically, speaking about analysis of events with ﬁxed particle multiplic-

ity one advocates to the ensemble of events - charged-multiplicity classes of collision events

with multiplicities of all charged particles in some ﬁxed particle bins. In heavy ion collisions,

measurement of observables as a function of multiplicity class has a long history and is re-

garded as a proxy for centrality dependence. Recently, due to the start of the Large Hadron

Collider (LHC) experiments where colliding energies per nucleon pair are in a TeV region,

the ﬁxed particle multiplicity technique was utilized also for analysis of the Bose-Einstein

correlations of identical particles in proton-proton collisions [5].

It is ﬁrmly established now that high energy heavy ion collisions are described basically

by hydrodynamics (for recent reviews, see Ref. [6]), as well as that at the later dilute stage

of matter evolution the hydrodynamics is followed by the highly dissipative hadronic gas

expansion that is modeled by a hadronic cascade model like UrQMD [7] till free stream-

ing regime is reached. The so-called particlization – transition from continuous medium

(hydrodynamic) consideration of the system to its particle-based description – is associated

typically with lowest possible temperature when the system is still close to local thermal and

chemical equilibrium. It deﬁnes the isotherm which is often called the chemical freeze-out

hypersurface. Situation is less clear in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions, while there

are also attempts to describe particle momentum spectra in high-multiplicity proton-proton

collisions in hydrodynamic approach (see, e.g., Ref. [8]).

2

It is worthy to note that quantum statistics is not inherent property of these1 quasi-

classical models. Typically, when hadrons are generated on the particlization hypersurface,

the single particle weight is sampled according to the Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac distri-

butions in Grand Canonical Ensemble (with viscous corrections, if necessary) based on

the so-called Cooper-Frye prescription [9]. As for the two- identical partice spectra, the

current quasiclassical simulations utilize the factorized decomposition of the two-particle

emission function into the single-particle ones accounting for additional multiplier pro-

portional to the module squared of two-particle symmetrized/antisymmetrized amplitudes,
so that the correlation function becomes (omitting all non-principal details) C(p1, p2) ∝
h1 ± cos(p1 − p2)(x1 − x2)i, where angular brackets mean averaging over emission functions.
Such an local “switching on” of the quantum statistic eﬀects into two-particle cross-sections

is similar as in the Final-State-Interaction (FSI) method. However, the quantum statistics

is not associated with local two-particle interaction but is the global eﬀect, and complete

symmetrization/antisymmetrization of the total

system is required to ﬁnd the correct re-

sults for one- and multi- particle momentum spectra. Such an analysis was done in Refs.

[10, 11]. It has been shown that for thermal identical particles the above mentioned pro-

cedure for one- and two-boson spectra evaluations in quasi-classical models is correct if

one provides the symmetrization in an ensemble of initially independently emitted thermal

Boltzmann particles with Poissonian distribution for the particle number in the ensemble.

Otherwise, the above described prescription for the simulation of the single- and double-

particle spectra and correlation function C(p1, p2) is not correct. In particular, it is violated

for the states with a ﬁxed boson number. The detail grounding of such a conclusion, pro-

vided in Ref.

[11] with corresponding numerical calculations, is based on non-relativistic

Kopylov-Podgoretsky model [1] of initially Boltzmann independent factorized sources (with

subsequent symmetrization).

In this note we are based on thermal canonical and grand canonical bosonic ensembles

for quantum relativistic ideal gases, that allows us to avoid speciﬁc procedure of “switching

on” quantum statistics as well as the supposition of initially distinguishable sources. Our

aim is to clarify the general reasons of violation of the standard prescriptions for C(p1, p2)

(see above) when one calculates the correlation function in events with ﬁxed multiplicity

or just on event-by-event basis [4]. The answer is not trivial and depends on applicability

1 as well as many others

3

of the thermal Wick theorem [12]. It is beyond the scope of this study to give a compre-

hensive analysis and prescription for quasiclassical event generators dealing with p + p and

A + A collisions. Rather, the purpose of the paper is to show how imposed particle number

constraints inﬂuence on single-particle momentum density and two-particle momentum cor-

relation function in canonical ensemble of ﬁnite system, and calculate analytical expressions

for them in some tractable approximations. In particular, the conditions under which the

standard decomposition of two-particle distribution can be applied are also considered.

II. ONE- AND TWO- PARTICLE MOMENTUM SPECTRA IN GRAND CANON-

ICAL AND CANONICAL ENSEMBLES OF IDENTICAL BOSONS

We begin by brieﬂy reviewing the properties of the quantum grand-canonical ensemble

of non-interacting boson ﬁeld with plane waves satisfying periodic boundary conditions on

the walls of a cubic box (see, e.g., [13]).

A. Momentum spectra and Wick’s theorem in grand canonical ensemble

Basic quantity, the grand-canonical statistical operator, can be written as follows:

(1)

ρ = exp (−β(bH − µbN )),

where β = 1/T is inverse temperature, bH =Pp ǫpa+
single-particle state, bN =Pp a+

p , and annihila-
tion, ap, operators satisfy the following canonical commutation relation in the discrete-mode

p ap is particle number operator. Creation, a+

p ap is Hamiltonian, ǫp is the energy of the

representation:

where δpp′ is the Kronecker delta function. For notational simplicity, here and below we

[ap, a+

p′] = δpp′,

(2)

write p instead of (px, py, pz). The expectation value of an operator bA can be expressed as

(3)

where Z is the grand-canonical partition function,

T r[ρbA]

Z

,

hbAi =

Z = T r[ρ].

4

(4)

In what follows we assume for simplicity that chemical potential µ = 0. For µ 6= 0 substitu-
tion ǫp → ǫp − µ has to be utilized in corresponding expressions.

Using the eigenstates of the particle number operator,

|p1, ..., pNi =

1
√N!

a+
p1...a+

pN|0i,

and the identity

we may bring statistical operator (1) to a form

XN Xp1,...,pN
ρ =XN Xp1,...,pN

|p1, ..., pNihp1, ..., pN| = 1,

e−βǫp1

−...−βǫpN|p1, ..., pNihp1, ..., pN|.

expectation values of operators a+

Because our aim here is calculation of a two-boson correlation function, we are interested in
p2ap1ap2, other n−point operator functions
can be calculated in a similar way, if necessary. For calculations we adapt the method

p1ap2 and a+

p1a+

proposed in Ref.

[12] (see also Refs.

[13, 14]). The corresponding results are, of course,

well known, but it allows us to show a simple example of calculations with the method of

Ref.

[12], and will help to reveal diﬀerences with calculations when ﬁxed particle number

constraint is utilized.

Our starting point is the relationship

apρ = ρape−βǫp,

(8)

which can be proved by using an elementary operator algebra and Eq. (7). Then, using

trace invariance under the cyclic permutation of an operator, we get

T r[ρa+

p1ap2] = e−βǫp2 T r[ρap2a+

p1] = e−βǫp2 T r[ρa+

p1ap2] + e−βǫp2 δp1p2.

(5)

(6)

(7)

(9)

(10)

From the above equation we have

ha+
p1ap2i =

δp1p2
eβǫp2 − 1

,

that is familiar Bose-Einstein distribution. Similarly, the trace T r[ρa+

p1a+

p2ap1ap2] can be

expressed as

T r[ρa+

p1a+

p2ap1ap2] =

e−βǫp2 δp1p2T r[ρa+

p2ap1] + e−βǫp2 δp2p2T r[ρa+

p1ap1] + e−βǫp2 T r[ρa+

p1a+

p2ap1ap2],

(11)

5

and we have

T r[ρa+

p1a+

p2ap1ap2] =

Then, taking into account (10), ha+

δp1p2
eβǫp2 − 1
p1a+

p2ap1ap2i reads
p2ap1iha+

T r[ρa+

p2ap1] +

δp2p2

T r[ρa+

(12)

p1a+
ha+

p2ap1ap2i = ha+

p1ap2i + ha+

p1ap1iha+

p2ap2i,

(13)

which is nothing but the particular case of the thermal Wick theorem [12] (see also Ref.

[15] where applicability of the thermal Wick theorem for inhomogeneous locally equilibrated

non-interacting systems is analyzed). Notice that to derive (10) and (13) we do not need an

explicit expression for the grand-canonical partition function (4).

B. The momentum spectra in canonical ensemble with with ﬁxed particle number

constraint (discrete mode representation)

Now, let us apply ﬁxed particle number constraint to grand-canonical statistical operator

(1). For this aim, one can utilize the projection operator PN ,
|p1, ..., pNihp1, ..., pN|,

PN = Xp1,...,pN

(14)

that automatically invokes the ﬁxed particle number constraint. Then we assert that canon-

ical statistical operator with ﬁxed particle number constraint, ρN , is

ρN = PN ρPN = Xp1,...,pN

e−βǫp1

−...−βǫpN|p1, ..., pNihp1, ..., pN|.

The expectation value of an operator bA can be deﬁned as

T r[ρN A]

,

where ZN is the corresponding canonical partition function,

hbAiN =

ZN

ZN = T r[ρN ].

(15)

(16)

(17)

In order to evaluate expectation values of operators a+

p1ap2 and a+

p1a+

p2ap1ap2 with canonical

statistical operator ρN , see Eqs. (15) and (16), we ﬁrst utilize elementary operator algebra

to prove that

apρN = ρN −1ape−βǫp.

p1a+

p2ap1iN −1 + δp2p2ha+

p2ap1iN −1 =

p1ap1iN −1(cid:1) ,

(21)

(22)

Then, to evaluate the trace T r[ρN a+

q1aq2], we exploit its invariance under cyclic permutations

and get

T r[ρN a+

p1ap2] = e−βǫp2 T r[ρN −1ap2a+

p1] = e−βǫp2 T r[ρN −1a+

p1ap2] + e−βǫp2 δp1p2.

From (19) we have the iteration relation

(19)

(20)

By using (20) one can prove by induction (see also Ref. [16] and references therein) that

ha+
p1ap2iN = δp1p2

e−iβǫp2

In the same way we obtain

and one can prove by induction that

ha+
p1a+

p2ap1ap2iN = δp1p2

ZN ha+

p2ap1iN −i + δp2p2

Finally, using Eq. (21) and taking into account that ha+
becomes

e−iβǫp2

ZN −i
ZN ha+

p1ap1iN −i.(23)

NXi=1

piapji0 = 0, we see that Eq. (23)

(24)

It is immediately apparent from Eqs. (21), (23) and (24) that for non-interacting canon-

ical ensemble with ﬁxed particle number constraint the decomposition (13), which follows

from the thermal Wick theorem, is no more valid.2 Also, notice that for practical utilizations

of Eqs. (21) and (24) one needs ﬁrst to calculate canonical partition functions. The latter

can be done by means of the recurrence relations as given in Ref. [18]. Below, for a reader

convenience, we present elementary derivation of it. As the starting point we utilize relation

Xp
ha+
p apiN = N,

(25)

2 Notice also Ref. [17] where expressions for these expectation values were derived in rather compact form

at the price of an additional integrations.

7

which follows from the deﬁnition of ρN , see Eqs. (15) and (16). Then, accounting for (21)

we get

NZN =

NXi=1Xp

e−iβǫpZN −i.

The above expression can be rewritten as

(26)

(27)

ZN =

1
N

e−(N −i)βǫp.

N −1Xi=0

ZiXp

Taking into account that Z0 = h0|0i = 1, we get Z1 = Pp e−βǫp. Then the recurrence

relation can be expressed in its ﬁnal form as

ZN =

1
N

N −1Xi=0

ZiZ1((N − i)β),

where for notational convenience we have deﬁned quantities

Z1(jβ) =Xp

e−jβǫp.

(28)

(29)

Then, the use of Eqs. (28) and (29) allows one to determine the canonical partition functions

and, therefore, to calculate Eqs. (21) and (24) in the canonical ensemble with periodical

boundary conditions.

C. Canonical ensemble in thermodynamic limit

It is worth noting that periodical boundary conditions are just mathematical trick which

allows convenient mathematical description of ﬁnite-volume systems. To eliminate these

artiﬁcial assumptions, the transition to the thermodynamic limit is typically applied. Then

the number (or the mean number in a grand-canonical ensemble) of particles N and the
volume V of the system go to ∞ while keeping particle density n = N/V constant. As the
result, the discrete-mode representation tends to the continuous momentum representation

of the canonical operators. In this limit, strongly speaking, normalization of the statistical

operator fails because the partition function diverges, but the expectation values can be still

deﬁned. There is no problems with application of this limit to expectation values (10) and

(13) calculated in grand-canonical ensemble, but computations of ones, (21) and (23), in

canonical ensemble are more involved problem because (21) and (23) explicitly depend on

8

canonical partition functions. In order to overcome this problem, let us ﬁrst utilize Eq. (26)

to write ZN −j−1/ZN −j as

ZN −j−1
ZN −j

=

N − j

i=1 Pp e−iβǫpZN −j−i−1
N − j − 1PN −j−1
i=1 Pp e−iβǫpZN −j−i
PN −j

.

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

It is immediately apparent from Eq. (30) that for any ﬁxed j in the thermodynamic limit

lim

N,V →∞

ZN −j−1
ZN −j

= lim

N,V →∞

ZN −1
ZN ≡ γ,

and therefore,

Thus we observe that Eq. (30) in the thermodynamic limit becomes identity,

i=1Pp e−iβǫp(cid:16) ZN −1
ZN (cid:17)i

.

By using Eq. (32), one can write the sum in Eqs. (21) and (24) for γe−βǫp < 1 as follows:

and

ha+
p1ap2iN,V →∞ =

δp1p2

p1a+
ha+

p2ap1ap2iN,V →∞ =

δp1p2δp2p1 + δp2p2δp1p1

(eβǫp1 γ −1 − 1) (eβǫp2 γ −1 − 1)

.

(34)

(35)

Notice that above expressions satisfy principle of the thermodynamic equivalence between
canonical ensemble and grand canonical ensemble with eβµ = ZN −1
ZN

(see also Ref. [19]).

Finally, redeﬁning in the thermodynamic limit δ(k − k′) = (2π)−3V δkk′, and a(k) =

((2π)−3V )1/2(2E(k))1/2ak we get

ha+(p1)a(p2)i =

2E(p2)δ(p1 − p2)
eβE(p2)γ −1 − 1

.

and

ha+(p1)a+(p2)a(p1)a(p2)i =

2E(p2)2E(p1)((δ(p1 − p2))2 + (δ(0))2)

(eβE(p1)γ −1 − 1) (eβE(p2)γ −1 − 1)

(36)

(37)

It is easy seen from Eqs. (36) and (37) that ha+(p1)a+(p2)a(p1)a(p2)i can be written as

ha+(p1)a+(p2)a(p1)a(p2)i =
ha+(p2)a(p1)iha+(p1)a(p2i + ha+(p1)a(p1)iha+(p2)a(p2i.

(38)

Equation (38) is the particular case of the thermal Wick theorem [12] and is the conse-

quence of general results about equivalency of canonical and grand canonical ensembles in

the thermodynamic limit. However, in realistic physical situations when particles production

occurs from extremely small systems with typical size 10−14 m created in relativistic nucleus

and particle collisions, one should use approximation of the thermodynamic limit with great

caution especially in the correlation femtoscopy probing the system eﬀective sizes.

III. TWO-BOSON CORRELATIONS AT FIXED MULTIPLICITIES AND FINITE

VOLUMES

In the previous section we calculated the expectation values of creation and annihilation

operators both in a ﬁnite volume with periodical boundary conditions and in the thermo-

dynamic limit. We demonstrated that only for the latter case the thermal Wick theorem is

applied in canonical ensemble of non-interacting particles with ﬁxed particle number con-

straint. Our aim in this section is to adjust these results for correlation femtoscopy analysis

of systems created in high energy particle and nucleus collisions. To do it, one needs, ﬁrst,

take into account that experimentally measured observables are one- and two- particle mo-

mentum spectra in the continuous-mode momentum representation, and, second, that ﬁnite

sizes measured by this method do not allow treat these systems in the thermodynamic limit.

Then, in order to be able to consider such systems in present simple approach, let us as-

sume that the Compton wavelength as well as the thermal one are much less than a size

of the system. It allows one to use the continuous-mode momentum representation without

invoking the thermodynamic limit. Then, to evaluate quantities in interest, we will use as

the starting point Eqs. (21) and (24). Notice that systems with small particle numbers

can be easily investigated by exploiting recurrence relations for the partition function and

performing straightforward exact calculations, as we will demonstrate later. However, if N

is ﬁnite but rather large, as it can happen in relativistic nucleus collisions, some appropriate

approximations should be used.

Then, assuming that system’s boundary is not sharp but smeared with smooth cutoﬀ,

we substitute

V
(2π)3 δp1p2 →

R3
(2π)3/2 e−(p1

−p2)2R2/2

(39)

in Eqs. (21) and (24), notice that

R3

(2π)3/2 e−(p1

−p2)2R2/2 → δ(p1 − p2) when R → ∞. The pa-

10

rameter R can be then related with volume V from the discrete-mode “box” representation:

R3 = V (2π)−3/2.

(40)

Experimentally, Bose-Einstein correlations are measured in terms of a two-particle correla-

tion function, which can be deﬁned in this model as

CN (p, q) = CN ha+(p1)a+(p2)a(p1)a(p2)iN
ha+(p1)a(p1)iNha+(p2)a(p2)iN

,

(41)

where p = (p1 + p2)/2, q = p2 − p1, and CN is normalization constant, the latter is needed
to normalize the theoretical correlation function in accordance with normalization that is
applied by experimentalists: CN (p, q) → 1 for |q| → ∞. Substitution Eqs. (21) and (24)
into Eq. (41) yields

CN (p, q) = CN

where we performed transition to the continuous-mode representation as is described above.
Despite of its complexity, this expression allows a trivial evaluation of the |q| → ∞ limit.
Namely, because E(p1) and E(p2) tends to ∞ when |q| → ∞ at ﬁxed p, we see that
in this limit. If we now demand that CN (p, q) → 1 if |q| → ∞, we
CN (p, q) → CN
see that the normalization factor introduced in Eq. (41) is

(43)

Note, the above transition from discrete momentum representation to continuous one in

a ﬁnite volume is an approximation. Exact expression should be based on an statistical

operator (partition function) for ﬁnite systems, similar as it was realized in Ref.

[15] for

particular case of grand canonical ensemble in a locally-equilibrated longitudinally expanding

system. For canonical ensemble with ﬁxed particle number this is especially non-trivial

problem. The results for a speciﬁc case that includes the symmetrization procedure for

initially non-symmetrized amplitude of boson radiation from factorized independent (non-

coherent) sources are presented in Ref. [11].

In Fig. 1 we illustrate and compare the results for two-pion correlation functions C(qx =

q, qy = 0, qz = 0; px = p, py = 0, pz = 0) with p = 0.2 GeV/c, R = 3 fm, T = 0.06 GeV

in the case when the two-pion spectrum, which corresponds to expression in numerator

of Eq.

(42), is calculated for the two-particle system: N = 2. First, we present the

11

“standard” correlation function C(p, q) = 1 + exp (−q2R2) that, in fact, corresponds to the
correlation function (42) with N = 2 in numerator and N = 1 in denominator (pre-fraction

normalization constant C2 is modiﬁed correspondingly). Such a formal case was considered

in Ref. [3] and it was shown that the above result takes place only if there is no coherence

(for example, due to quantum uncertainty principle) in particle radiation.

It worthy to

note that the same “standard” behavior takes place in the grand canonical ensemble for

bosons [10] when the (eﬀective) system sizes are much larger then the thermal de Broglie

wavelength [3, 15]. The second result that we present for C(p, q) corresponds to the one-

particle pion spectra in the two-boson system calculated in direct way by integration of the

two-particle spectra (numerator of Eq. (42)) over one of the particle momenta. The third

result is based on our approximation of Eqs. (21), (24) for the realistic case of continuous

momenta of particles occupied initially an eﬀectively ﬁnite volume.

It is represented by

the correlation function in the form (42) without any modiﬁcation. One can see that the

last result qualitatively reproduces the previous one where the “continuous approximation”

for the two-boson spectra (numerator of Eq. (42)) is considered as exact result. Namely,

in both approaches the correlation functions are suppressed (their intercepts are reduced),

they lose the Gaussian form even for the Gaussain source, the correlation function C(p, q)

becomes less than unity at intermediate q values and approaches the limiting value of 1

from below. The same properties were observed in Ref.

[11]. The results based on grand

canonical ensemble have no such peculiarities. The reason for them is the violation of the

Wick theorem for heat systems with ﬁxed multiplicity.

In what follows to see corresponding eﬀects in the systems with ﬁnite but rather large

N, we will be based on our approximation of Eqs. (21), (24) for continuous momenta in a

ﬁnite volume, see Eq. (42). To proceed further with Eq. (42), let us ﬁrst write recurrence

relation (28) as

ZN =

1
N

N −2Xi=0

Utilizing again Eq. (28), one can express ZN −1 as

ZiZ1((N − i)β) +

1
N

ZN −1Z1(β).

ZN −1 =

ZiZ1((N − i − 1)β).

Thus we observe that

It is instructively to compare the above expression with a typical experimental parametriza-

tion of the two-boson Bose-Einstein correlation function, which looks like

CN (p, q) = 1 + λ(p) exp (−R2

Gq2).

(58)

Here 0 ≤ λ(p) ≤ 1 describes the correlation strength, RG is the Gaussian interferometry
radius, and to allow comparison with our simple model we simplify the real experimental

three-dimensional parametrization by assuming spherical symmetry in Eq. (58). To do this
comparison, ﬁrst notice that λ(p) = CN (p, 0) − 1, and one can see from Eq.
intercept CN (p, 0) is

(57) that

(60)

Notice that the Bose-Einstein correlations are suppressed, λ(p) < 1, and that λ(p) → 1
when V → ∞, therefore Eq. (60) represents the ﬁnite-volume eﬀect in a canonical ensemble
with ﬁxed particle multiplicity. One can see that the suppression becomes stronger when

the system size tends to thermal de Broglie wavelength.
It was shown in the model of
independent incoherent emitters, that λ → 0 in ﬁxed ﬁnite system at ﬁxed multiplicity,

interpreted as a measure of coherence in a theoretical model: λ = 0 for a pure quantum
state and 0 < λ ≤ 1 for a mixed quantum state (see, e.g., [2, 3]). However, in the case of
thermal systems with ﬁxed multiplicity, the suppression of the correlation function is the

14

result of violation of the Wick’s theorem. Then the coherence eﬀects need in an additional

speciﬁc treatment [3].

Using Eq. (60), we see that (57) can be written in the form

where the factor

Equations (58), (61) and (62) allow us to relate R and RG for small |q|, when R2q2 ≪ 1
Gq2 ≪ 1. Then, expanding C(p, q) in q and keeping ﬁrst term in Taylor series, we

C(p, q) ≈ 1 + λ(p)(1 − R2

(65)

Here we assume that system size is large enough in comparison with thermal wavelength,

etc., and replace f (p, q) by 1. After equating (64) and (65) we get eventually

Remind that this rough approximation is valid only when λ is close to unity. It is interesting

to note that the Gaussian interferometry radius exhibits an decrease as pair momentum

increases that is similar to well-known behavior of a homogeneity length which is associated

with Gaussian interferometry radius in a locally-equilibrated expanding system [21].

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we analyze single- and two-particle momentum correlation functions for

ﬁnite canonical systems of non-interacting particles with ﬁxed particle number constraint.

We ﬁnd that the corresponding expressions satisfy the thermal Wick theorem in the ther-

modynamic limit, and do not satisfy one in the general ﬁnite case. Our analysis implies that

contrary to traditional believes (see e.g. Ref. [4]), decomposition of two-particle distribution

function through one-particle ones is questionable for class of events with ﬁxed multiplicities

originated from small thermal systems.

Furthermore, we evaluated the two-particle correlation function in a low particle num-

ber density approximation in a canonical ensemble model. An analysis of the two-particle

correlation function indicates that even for Gaussian source the correlation function is non-

Gaussian, reaches the values less than unity in some intermediate region of relative mo-

mentum of particles q, the apparent source size (interferometry radius extracted from the
typical experimental parametrization for small values of |q|) decreases with the half-sum
pair momentum |p| and at large |p| reaches static Gaussian source value.

It is found that the ﬁnite size eﬀect in thermal systems with ﬁxed multiplicity results

in a reduction of the intercept of correlation function. In approximation of small particle

number density, the “coherence parameter” λ becomes smaller than unity and decreases
when the system size approaches the thermal de Broglie wavelength. As |p| increases the
It is interesting to note
parameter rises gradually and reaches the constant value of 1.

that experimentally measured by diﬀerent LHC collaborations [5] with various methods of

analysis values of λ in p + p collisions are smaller than unity and exhibit an decrease as the

average momentum of the pair increases. The latter is at variance from an behavior of λ

in a canonical ensemble model and could be caused by speciﬁc non-thermal mechanism of

particle production in p + p collisions, e.g. by pions originated from resonances, but analysis

of the latter goes beyond the scope of the present note.

In the present work, to make the problem tractable, we used a simple static canonical

model while the particle-emitting sources produced in high energy heavy ion collisions are

expanded, interactions between the emitted particles are rather complicated and include the

resonance decays, etc. Therefore, further investigations based on a more realistic model of

evolving source could be of great interest. However, we hope that present analysis sheds

16

light on additional reason (besides the purity, long-lived resonances and coherence) of a sup-

pression of the correlation function expressed by the parameter λ – in part it is a measure

of the degree of Wick’s theorem violation in a thermal system with ﬁxed particle number

constraint or in single-event correlation femtoscopy. It may be useful also to include corre-

sponding quantum corrections into the modeling of two-particle Bose-Einstein correlations

arising in small thermal systems created in relativistic nucleus and particle collisions.
