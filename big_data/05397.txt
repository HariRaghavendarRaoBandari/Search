Formation and plasma circulation of solar prominences

Accepted for publication in ApJ

C. Xia1, R. Keppens1,2

ABSTRACT

Solar prominences are long-lived cool and dense plasma curtains in the hot
and rareﬁed outer solar atmosphere or corona. The physical mechanism respon-
sible for their formation and especially for their internal plasma circulation has
been uncertain for decades. The observed ubiquitous down ﬂows in quiescent
prominences are diﬃcult to interpret as plasma with high conductivity seems to
move across horizontal magnetic ﬁeld lines. Here we present three-dimensional
numerical simulations of prominence formation and evolution in an elongated
magnetic ﬂux rope as a result of in-situ plasma condensations fueled by con-
tinuous plasma evaporation from the solar chromosphere. The prominence is
born and maintained in a fragmented, highly dynamic state with continuous
reappearance of multiple blobs and thread structures that move mainly down-
ward dragging along mass-loaded ﬁeld lines. The prominence plasma circulation
is characterized by the dynamic balance between the drainage of prominence
plasma back to the chromosphere and the formation of prominence plasma via
continuous condensation. Plasma evaporates from the chromosphere, condenses
into the prominence in the corona, and drains back to the chromosphere, es-
tablishing a stable chromosphere-corona plasma cycle. Synthetic images of the
modeled prominence with the Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imag-
ing Assembly closely resemble actual observations, with many dynamical threads
underlying an elliptical coronal cavity.

INTRODUCTION

Solar prominences are about 100 times denser and cooler than their surrounding hot
corona, with their weight supported by the magnetic ﬁeld against gravity. They exist for
days to weeks above polarity inversion lines (PIL), which separate positive and negative
magnetic ﬂux regions in the photosphere. Prominences are frequently found inside coro-
nal cavities, which are tunnel-like elliptical dark regions (Gibson et al. 2010) at the solar
limb, with up to 40 % density depletion (Fuller et al. 2008), around the prominences. The
magnetic structure hosting a prominence and its cavity is believed to be a helical mag-
netic ﬂux rope conﬁned by overlying magnetic loops, which is consistent with observed
spinning plasma motions (Wang & Stenborg 2010) as well as linear polarization signatures
(Bak-St¸e´slicka et al. 2013). A ﬂux rope was present in early two-dimensional (2D) theoret-
ical prominence models (Kuperus & Raadu 1974) and 2D magnetohydrostatic solutions for
prominence-embedded ﬂux ropes have been demonstrated analytically (Low & Zhang 2004)
and numerically (Blokland & Keppens 2011; Hillier & van Ballegooijen 2013).

Static prominence models assume that quiescent prominences change little with time.
However, high resolution observations have found that quiescent prominences consist of ﬁne
and vertically oriented plasma threads, that continuously evolve with downward motions
(4 to 35 km s−1) (Engvold 1976; Berger et al. 2008; Chae et al. 2008). Moreover, episodic
dark plumes may rise (Berger et al. 2008, 2011) from the bottom of prominences and prop-
agate upward between threads with speeds about 10 to 20 km s−1. The heavy prominence
material suspended above the light coronal plasma can be liable to Rayleigh–Taylor (RT)
instability (Ryutova et al. 2010) which has been investigated in several numerical magne-
tohydrodynamic (MHD) models (Khomenko et al. 2014; Hillier et al. 2011; Terradas et al.
2015; Keppens et al. 2015). However, none of these models addressed prominence formation
and mass cycling, or studied a realistic 3D ﬂux rope.

The idea that prominences form via in situ condensation of coronal plasma was inferred
from thermal instability theory (Parker 1953; Field 1965) and is supported by observa-
tions in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels (Liu et al. 2012; Berger et al. 2012). Moreover,
continuous condensations must happen to compensate mass loss of quiescent prominences,
which requires an incessant supply of hot plasma from chromosphere to corona. Such hot
plasma ﬂows have not been convincingly detected, although persistent horizontal ﬂows of
Hα-emitting cool plasma originating from the chromosphere into a prominence was observed
(Chae et al. 2008) and the episodic dark rising plumes ﬁlled with hot plasma may provide
a small fraction of the needed mass (Berger et al. 2010). Numerical modeling of condensa-
tions as a result of runaway radiative cooling started with one-dimensional hydrodynamic
simulations along individual magnetic ﬁeld lines (Antiochos et al. 1999; Karpen et al. 2001;

– 3 –

Xia et al. 2011; Luna et al. 2012) and progressed in recent years to 2D MHD simulations in
magnetic arcades (Xia et al. 2012; Keppens & Xia 2014). These models add localized heat-
ing at footpoints of magnetic loops to evaporate plasma from chromosphere to corona leading
to continuous condensations. However, restricted by 1D or 2D setups, they cannot fully es-
tablish the internal dynamics of prominences. Recent work on prominence formation via in
situ condensation in a 2D (Kaneko & Yokoyama 2015) and 3D ﬂux rope (Xia et al. 2014a)
did not reproduce internal dynamics and mass drainage and only found a small prominence
fragment that settled in a magnetostatic equilibrium.

We here report a set of 3D models that for the ﬁrst time ever demonstrate continuous for-
mation of prominence condensations in a coronal cavity, achieving a balanced chromosphere-
corona plasma cycle characterized by vertical ﬂows in thin prominence threads. The numeri-
cal methods and the simulation procedure are explained in Section 2. We present the results
in Section 3. Finally, the results are discussed in Section 4.

2. SIMULATION STRATEGY

Since the magnetic topology of quiescent prominences is believed to be an elongated
magnetic ﬂux rope, we ﬁrst perform isothermal MHD simulations to simulate the formation of
a magnetic ﬂux rope driven by footpoint motions and ﬂux cancellation (van Ballegooijen & Martens
1989; Xia et al. 2014b). Our 3D model is set up in a Cartesian box covering 200 Mm × 120
Mm × 80 Mm , in x (-100 Mm to 100 Mm), y (-60 Mm to 60 Mm), and z (0 to 80 Mm) direc-
tions, where a ﬁnite beta corona of 1 MK constant temperature is initially constructed with
density and gas pressure prescribed from hydrostatic equilibrium with a bottom 109 cm−3
number density. We start from a bipolar magnetic ﬁeld in the shape of an elongated sheared
arcade. This arcade ﬁeld itself is generated by linear force-free ﬁeld extrapolation from an
analytically prescribed bipolar magnetogram with two opposite polarity regions shaped like
two parallel baguettes. This magnetogram Bm is formulated as:

B0 exp(− (x−x1+xL)2
2δx2
B0 exp(− (y−y1)2
B0 exp(− (x−x1−xL)2

where B0 = 20 G, x1 = x2 = 0 Mm, y1 = −y2 = 25 Mm, xL = 50 Mm, δx = 10 Mm, and
δy = 13 Mm. An exact Green’s function method (Chiu & Hilton 1977) is used to generate an
initial linear force-free ﬁeld with constant α = −0.08. Since our simulation box is intended
to start at low chromospheric heights, this magnetogram is placed 4 Mm below the bottom
plane of the simulation box.

A composite surface ﬂow is imposed at the bottom boundary with the formula as:

vb
y = −f (t)C1

∂|Bm|

∂y

exp(−y2/y2

d), vb

x = −vb
y

where yd = 35 Mm quantiﬁes an additional Gaussian width parameter away from the polarity
inversion line (PIL), f (t) is a linear ramp function to switch on and oﬀ the driving ﬂow, and
the amplitude factor C1 is chosen so that the driving speed has a maximum value of 12.8
km s−1 and the maximum initial Alfv´en Mach number is 0.0155. The ﬂow is a combination
of a shearing ﬂow and a converging ﬂow relative to the PIL. The shearing ﬂow roughly
mimics the eﬀective shearing of an east-west bipolar arcade by the diﬀerential rotation of
the solar surface. The converging ﬂow from the strong ﬁeld regions to weak ﬁeld regions is
an eﬀective result of magnetic element diﬀusion caused by random supergranular motions
(Leighton 1964). Flows far away from the PIL are suppressed by the exponential factor for
an easier handling of the side boundaries.

The model evolution is performed by solving the isothermal MHD equations given by

and g = −g⊙r2

where ρ, v, B, and I are the plasma density, velocity, magnetic ﬁeld, and unit tensor,
respectively, while the total pressure is ptot ≡ p + B2
⊙/(r⊙ + z)2ˆz is the
2µ0
gravitational acceleration with r⊙ the solar radius and g⊙ the solar surface gravitational
acceleration. To normalize the equations for computation, we use 10 Mm, 109 cm−3, 116.45
km s−1 , and 2 Gauss as the unit of length, number density, velocity, and magnetic ﬁeld,
respectively. We use the Adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement (AMR) Versatile Advection Code (MPI-
AMRVAC) (Keppens et al. 2012; Porth et al. 2014) to numerically solve these equations with
a third-order accurate scheme combining a Harten-Lax-van Leer scheme (Harten et al. 1983)
with a third-order limited reconstruction ( ˇCada & Torrilhon 2009) and a three-step Runge–
Kutta time integration. To numerically maintain close to zero divergence of the magnetic
ﬁeld, we use the Generalized Lagrangian Multiplier method (Dedner et al. 2002). The model
domain at this phase is discretized on a three-level AMR grid which has an eﬀective resolution
of 400 × 240 × 240 with the smallest cells of 500 km × 500 km × 333 km. The simulation
setup is completed by the following boundary conditions. We force zero vertical velocity
on the bottom face and zero velocity on the other ﬁve faces of the box by antisymmetric
boundary conditions. We extrapolate the magnetic ﬁeld at the bottom boundary and the

– 5 –

top boundary from inner physical values, keeping the normal gradient zero, with a one-
sided third-order ﬁnite diﬀerence representation. Then we modify the normal component to
enforce the divergence-free condition in a second-order centered diﬀerence evaluation. The
magnetic ﬁelds at the four side boundaries are kept ﬁxed. The density values in the side
boundary cells are copied from the neighbouring cells of the physical domain. We ﬁx the
gravitationally stratiﬁed density at the bottom and adopt a gravitationally stratiﬁed density
proﬁle at the top.

The bottom ﬂows drive those coronal loops that root in the inner halves of the main
arcade polarities to move towards aligning with the PIL. As footpoints from opposite po-
larities collide on the PIL, magnetic reconnections occur due to ﬁnite numerical resistivity,
to join arched loops into helical loops in a head-to-tail style. These helical loops, winding
about the same central axial ﬁeld line, form a helical magnetic ﬂux rope (see Figure 1). We
completely switch oﬀ the driving ﬂows after 100 minutes and let the ﬂux rope relax to an
equilibrium state. In the end of this stage, a large-scale elongated ﬂux rope is formed with
its ﬂux surface touching the bottom plane. The length of the ﬂux rope is about 160 Mm and
the diameter of its cross section is about 34 Mm. The density distribution does not change
much compared to the initial state and the magnetic ﬁeld has negligible Lorentz force.The
magnetic ﬁeld strength of the ﬂux rope is about 6 to 7 Gauss which is consistent with the
ﬁeld strength of a quiescent prominence since spectral polarimetric measurements show that
the magnetic ﬁeld in a quiescent prominence ranges from 3 to 30 G and it is predominantly
horizontal making an acute angle with respect to the axis of the prominence (Leroy et al.
1983; Bommier et al. 1994; Orozco Su´arez et al. 2014).

In the second stage, we perform a full MHD simulation to produce a modeled solar
atmosphere in thermal equilibrium containing the magnetic ﬂux rope which was generated
in the isothermal MHD modeling described above. To setup the initial state based on
the isothermal ﬂux rope, we kept the magnetic ﬁeld unchanged and modiﬁed the density
and temperature proﬁles from their isothermal states to a static vertically stratiﬁed solar
atmosphere including chromosphere, transition region, and corona. We set the region below
a height of 2.7 Mm to have chromospheric temperature 9600 K and above this height, the
temperature increases with height in such a way that the vertical thermal conduction ﬂux has
a constant value of 2 × 105 erg cm−2 s−1. The density is then derived assuming a hydrostatic
atmosphere with the number density at the bottom being 1.1 × 1013 cm−3. We now consider
the full MHD equations with the energy equation as:

∂E
∂t

+ ∇ ·(cid:18)Ev + ptotv −

where total pressure ptot ≡ p + B2/2µ0, gas pressure p = 2.3nHkBT , and total energy
E = p/(γ − 1) + ρv2/2 + B2/2µ0. We again use MPI-AMRVAC with the same combination

of schemes as the isothermal model. The ﬁeld-aligned (κ = κk
solved separately using a Runge-Kutta type Super Time Stepping scheme (Meyer et al. 2012)
and κk = 10−6T 5/2 erg cm−1 s−1 K−1 is the Spitzer conductivity. Optically thin radiative
cooling R = 1.2n2
HΛ(T ) is added using an exact integration scheme (Townsend 2009). To
maintain a hot corona, the coronal heating is simulated by adding the parametrized heating
term H = H0 = c0e−z/λ with c0 = 10−4 erg cm−3 s−1 and λ = 60 Mm. We increased the
highest AMR level of the mesh to 4, resulting in an eﬀective resolution of 800 × 480 × 480
with the smallest cells of 250 km × 250 km × 166 km. We modiﬁed the boundary conditions
from the isothermal model to set zero velocity and ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld at all boundaries.
The gas pressure is ﬁxed at the bottom and ﬂexible at the top according to gravitational
stratiﬁcation. At side boundaries, the gas pressure copies values from the inner layer in the
physical domain. This modiﬁed plasma state is not in thermal equilibrium, so we numerically
solve the full MHD equations involving optically thin radiative loss, anisotropic thermal
conduction and coronal heating until the system relaxes to a quasi-equilibrium after 114.5
minutes. Our endstate in this phase is reached when all thermal quantities settle into a stable
3D conﬁguration where the magnitude of the remaining velocity is less than 10 km s−1 and
it is representative of a stable ﬂux rope conﬁguration with hot coronal plasma trapped inside
it, where twisted ﬁeld lines connect chromospheric to coronal plasma regions.

In the third stage, we aim to form the macroscopic prominence in the stable ﬂux rope
obtained in the second stage. In order to simulate the chromospheric evaporation, which is
an eﬃcient way to bring material from the chromosphere to the corona, a relatively strong
localized heating H1 is added to the energy equation in addition to the global coronal heating
H0, namely, H = H0 +H1. We only add the localized heating H1 in two ﬁxed cylinders which
coincide with the two footpoint regions of the ﬂux rope. These two cylinders are centered
on (x, y) positions on the bottom plane at (64, 6) Mm and (-64, -6) Mm, with a radius of
20 Mm. Within them, H1 is constant in the chromosphere and decays rapidly with height
above the approximate location of the transition region:

H1 =(f (t)c1e−((z−zh)/Hm)2

f (t)c1

if z > zh

if z ≤ zh

where c1 = 10−2 erg cm−3 s−1, zh = 5 Mm and Hm = 3.16 Mm. This ﬁnal stage is simulated
for a total of over four hours, and it is this stage which is presented in what follows.

3. RESULTS

As chromospheric plasma gets evaporated into the corona, the lower part of the ﬂux
rope slowly evolves into a thermally unstable situation due to the dominating radiative

– 7 –

cooling. After about 100 minutes of gradual evolution, we then witness the runaway cooling
stage when the decrease of temperature ampliﬁes the radiation, leading to the formation
of dynamic blobs and threads. To get an overall impression of the evolution, we quantify
the temporal evolution of the mass, the average density, as well as the average velocity of
all prominence plasma and all coronal plasma in the computational box (see Figure 2a,b).
In this quantiﬁcation, prominence plasma has its number density higher than 1010 cm−3,
its temperature lower than 20,000 K, and its altitude higher than 8 Mm. The change in
local density and temperature conditions ultimately reaches the threshold to trigger thermal
instability, with plasma condensations forming at a rapid pace after 80 minutes, accompanied
by a decrease in coronal mass. At time 134.5 minutes, the mass of the prominence reaches
a maximal 3.1 × 1013 g, to then start decreasing as some blobs have by now fallen into the
chromosphere. After 164.5 minutes, the mass of the prominence settles and starts to oscillate
around an average value of 1.65 × 1013 g while the mass of the coronal volume reaches a
stable value of 8.3 × 1014 g. The number density of the prominence instantly adopts a
value consistent with observations, as it oscillates around a mean value of 1.88 × 1010 cm−3.
The average temperature of the prominence and the corona are 17,500 K and 1,660,000 K,
respectively. For the entire 80 minutes following, we see lots of dynamics in the prominence
as a whole, but the drainage of prominence mass into the chromosphere is balanced by
new-born prominence material in continuously forming condensations.

If we concentrate on the later stable phase after 164.5 minutes, the average vertical
velocity of the prominence plasma is −4.87 km s−1, showing that the prominence plasma
is generally descending at a speed much slower than free-fall speed, which is consistent
with observations (Liu et al. 2012). To understand the mass ﬂows, we quantify the mass
ﬂux through a horizontal plane at the bottom of the corona, including the total mass ﬂux
as well as contributions from prominence plasma, coronal plasma, and prominence-corona
transition region (PCTR) plasma (Figure 2c). Because of the chromospheric evaporation,
the upward mass ﬂux increases in the ﬁrst 7 minutes and then decreases, impeded by the
build-up of a high gas pressure inside the ﬂux rope. As soon as the condensations begin, the
evaporating mass ﬂow increases slowly and then gradually settles at around 3.1 × 1012 g s−1.
Prominence plasma with surrounding PCTR plasma starts to fall down through this plane
back into the chromosphere after 110 minutes. The corresponding mass ﬂuxes of prominence
plasma and PCTR plasma oscillate with time and eventually stabilize at around −1012 g
s−1 and −2.1 × 1012 g s−1, respectively. The total mass ﬂux oscillates around zero, implying
a dynamical equilibrium where a steady mass cycling is fully operational. We can draw
the analogy with the water cycle on Earth, since we have solar chromospheric plasma that
evaporates from the footpoints of the ﬂux rope to reach higher altitudes into the corona
where radiative condensations accumulate mass in prominence blobs that ultimately fall

– 8 –

back to the chromosphere.

The most striking ﬁnding of our model is the extremely dynamic and intrinsically frag-
mented appearance of the prominence matter, from its ﬁrst instant of formation throughout
its steady plasma cycle. The prominence plasma is born in thin threads and blobs distributed
over diﬀerent places in the ﬂux rope as visualized for a particular instant in Figure 3a.
Some of the blobs appear and then reside in the central dipped region of fairly left-right
symmetrical, twisted ﬁeld lines. Some blobs form and then surf along the shallow elbows of
asymmetrically twisted ﬁeld lines. A few blobs also pop up and then seemingly follow arched
regions of weakly twisted ﬁeld lines. Although every condensation has a diﬀerent size and
shape, the cross sections perpendicular to their long axis are roughly round. The diameter of
these cross sections range from 1000 km to 1800 km. A typical variation of the temperature,
density and velocity ﬁeld across an individual blob is shown for the thread in the zoomed
panel of Figure 3b. There are typically shearing ﬂows at both sides of the thread (Figure 3c).
These ﬂows themselves inﬂuence the thread dynamical evolution and the velocity diﬀerence
across the thread reaches up to 115 km s−1 with local Alfv´en Mach number up to 1.

We already mentioned that the average vertical velocity in prominence matter is a few
kilometers per second downwards. To see how the complex plasma motions of prominence
fragments interact with the magnetic ﬁeld, we use particle tracers to follow ﬂuid elements. At
time 143.1 minutes, we position massless and uncharged particles, which move passively with
the local velocity ﬁeld, in the cores of prominence threads, where plasma density is higher
than 2×1010 cm−3 with temperature lower than 20,000 K and plasma β (the ratio between gas
and magnetic pressure) ranges from 0.2 to 0.25. Each particle evolution involves integrating
the advection equation with velocity information interpolated from the MHD run. In this
integration process we introduce particle time steps diﬀerent from ﬂuid time steps (limited by
Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition) adopted in the time integration of the MHD equations:
within one MHD ﬂuid time step, the particles evolve more than one particle time step since
particles are restricted to travel a distance shorter than the size of a grid cell in one particle
time step. To evaluate the velocity of a particle at a particle time between two ﬂuid time
steps, we need both spatial and temporal interpolations on the velocity data from the MHD
run. We ﬁrst get two velocities at the particle position by linear spatial interpolation of the
ﬂuid velocity, one for each ﬂuid time step. Then we do another linear interpolation in time
between these two velocities to quantify the instantaneous local velocity ﬁeld. We solve the
equation of motion of the particle itself using an adaptive step size fourth-order Runge–Kutta
scheme. As the magnetic ﬁeld is frozen-in the plasma due to the high conductivity in the
solar atmosphere, these tracer particles allow us to disentangle the movement of individual
magnetic ﬁeld lines and the ﬂuid dynamics. We ﬁnd that generally, those condensations
that form and collect in the dips of helical magnetic ﬁeld lines move downward under gravity

– 9 –

dragging the ﬁeld lines down to make the dips deeper (Figure 4). Note that the translucent
yellow ﬁeld line at time 143.1 minutes is bent by the falling blob to become the green ﬁeld line
at a later time 214.7 minutes. A typical descending speed is about 6 km s−1 for the central
condensations. On the other hand, condensations forming in the legs of arched magnetic
ﬁeld lines slip down along the ﬁeld lines without signiﬁcant deformation of these ﬁeld lines.
The heated arcade loops of the ﬂux rope rise against the overlying constraining magnetic
arcade, and this also leads to interchange motions with upward rising ﬂux rope loops and
downward sinking coronal loops in higher up regions above the prominence.

To validate our model, we have made synthetic observations on our simulations with
technique details described in Xia et al. (2014a), for direct comparison with those from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) instrument. Syn-
thetic EUV images are generated from diﬀerent viewing angles through the AIA wavebands
at 211, 193, 171, and 304 ˚A, which have main contribution temperatures around 1.8, 1.5, 0.8,
and 0.08 MK, respectively. To mimic absorption of background extreme ultraviolet emission
by the prominence plasma, we exclude emission coming from behind prominence plasma
with density higher than 2 × 1010 cm−3. To view along the axis of the prominence, we select
a horizontal line of sight that deviates from the x-axis by 8.4 degrees. Viewing along the axis
of the prominence, the ﬂux rope region becomes brighter and reaches a maximum sequen-
tially in the 211, 193, and 171 ˚A extreme ultraviolet channels at time 55.8 minutes, 78.7
minutes, and 95.9 minutes, respectively. At time 40.1 minutes, bright horn-like structures
in the 304 ˚A image protrude from the chromosphere, showing that the prominence plasma
ﬁrst forms at low altitudes. Later on, dynamic dark clumps and threads, the dense cores
of the condensations, appear in the lower part of the ﬂux rope in the 211 and 171 ˚A hot
channels, while they are bright in the 304 ˚A cool channel (Figure 5). Smaller clumps tend
to form at higher altitudes and fall down into the chromosphere along curved trajectories.
Larger clumps and threads often present vertical pillars collected in the dipped region of the
ﬂux rope. A dark coronal cavity enclosed by a bright elliptical loop appears above the dark
condensations in hot channels, with higher contrast in hotter channels. The coronal cavity
expands slowly with time and reaches a height of 54 Mm at the end of our simulation. In
the bottom row of Figure 5, we plot AIA observations of a real prominence on August 10,
2011 for direct comparison. Our modeled prominence closely resembles the real observed
one. We prepared a movie (Supplementary Movie 1) to show the temporal evolution of the
axial view on the modeled prominence in AIA 211, 193, 171, and 304 ˚A channels. While
observations on solar prominences are limited to one or two viewing angles, we can observe
our simulated prominence from any viewing angle. When we put the line of sight along the
y-axis, we witness the prominence formation from the ﬂank. From this vantage point, the
weak EUV brightness in the initial corona is quite homogeneous until the localized heating

– 10 –

induces sudden brightening of the ﬂux rope where many thin helical loops prominently ap-
pear in the 211 and 193 ˚A images. At time 40.1 minutes, two oblique condensations, far from
each other, grow in the dipped portions of asymmetric twisted loops. In fact, these widely
separated threads are those that resemble the horns in the axial view. At time 95.9 minutes,
two long condensed threads, about 40 Mm long in 304 ˚A, stretch horizontally across helical
ﬁeld lines at altitudes of about 20 Mm. Then numerous fragmented condensations appear
and cluster in several places. They follow diﬀerent curved trajectories of varying shape and
size. Many of them slip into the left and right footpoints of the ﬂux rope, while others linger
in the central dipped regions (see Supplementary Movie 2).

4. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The model described above demonstrated the physical mechanism responsible for the
formation of prominences in realistic 3D coronal environments and self-consistently explained
the vertical ﬂows in thin prominence threads, which reveal the plasma circulation of long-
lived prominences. Their longevity is in analogy with the water cycle on Earth where plasma
evaporates from the chromosphere into the corona, in-situ condensations happen continu-
ously to form threads by runaway cooling, while prominence threads descend and eventually
fall back to the chromosphere, dragging along the mass-loaded magnetic ﬁeld lines. This
oﬀers completely new insights on how prominence matter gets recycled between chromo-
spheric and coronal heights, and revolutionizes all previous models where a more static,
large-scale structure to model prominences is adopted. Since many prominences erupt into
interplanetary space at the end of their lives, they are vital ingredients in coronal mass ejec-
tions (CME) which may have severe impact on the terrestrial space environment. To better
understand prominence eruption and CMEs, realistic prominence models are needed. Our
model represents a milestone for constructing realistic prominence models and can now be
used to initiate and study the eruption phase in details.

Fig. 2.— Quantifying the formation and mass circulation of a virtual prominence. a, evolu-
tion of prominence mass (solid line) and coronal mass (dashed line) in the box. b, evolution of
average plasma number density of the prominence (solid line) and the corona (dashed line).
c, evolution of mass ﬂux, through the bottom coronal plane (z = 8 Mm), of prominence
plasma (dashed line), coronal plasma (dashed dotted line), prominence-corona transition
region (PCTR) (dotted line), and all plasma together (solid line). The PCTR is where the
plasma density is lower than 109 cm−3 and temperature lower than 100,000 K.

Fig. 3.— Prominence, magnetic ﬁeld lines and shearing ﬂows at time 203.2 minutes. a,
a global view of the prominence with the yellow translucent density contours at 4 × 109
cm−3, the red density contours at 1010 cm−3, magnetic ﬁeld lines (colored by temperature
Te) threading through the prominence, a purple magnetic ﬁeld line representing the axis of
the ﬂux rope, and the bottom plane colored by Bz. b, close-up view of the region in white
rectangular box in a with a white straight line cutting through a thread and the number
density (pink curve), temperature (black curve) and velocities (blue curve Vx, green curve
Vy, red curve Vz) along the cutting line displayed in c.

Fig. 4.— Falling prominence blobs dragging down magnetic ﬁeld lines. At time 143.1
minutes, three particle tracers, shown as the red, green, and yellow small squares, are added
in prominence blobs (translucent blue contours). At a later time 214.7 minutes, these particle
tracers descend with trajectories colored by the time step of particles. The red and green
traced blobs drag down the green and pink ﬁeld lines in their dips while the yellow marked
blob slides along the purple ﬁeld line. The translucent yellow ﬁeld line is threading through
the red tracer at time 143.1 minutes.
