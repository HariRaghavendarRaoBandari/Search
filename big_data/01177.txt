ABSTRACT

Context. X-rays/EUV radiation emitted from wind-embedded shocks in hot, massive stars can aﬀect the ionization balance in their
outer atmospheres, and can be the mechanism responsible for the production of highly ionized atomic species detected in stellar wind
UV spectra.
Aims.To allow for these processes in the context of spectral analysis, we have implemented the emission from wind-embedded shocks
and related physics into our uniﬁed, NLTE model atmosphere/spectrum synthesis code FASTWIND.
Methods.The shock structure and corresponding emission is calculated as a function of user-supplied parameters (volume ﬁlling fac-
tor, radial stratiﬁcation of shock strength, and radial onset of emission). We account for a temperature and density stratiﬁcation inside
the post-shock cooling zones, calculated for radiative and adiabatic cooling in the inner and outer wind, respectively. The high-energy
absorption of the cool wind is considered by adding important K-shell opacities, and corresponding Auger ionization rates have been
included into the NLTE network. To test our implementation and to check the resulting eﬀects, we calculated a comprehensive model
grid with a variety of X-ray emission parameters.
Results. We tested and veriﬁed our implementation carefully against corresponding results from various alternative model atmo-
sphere codes, and studied the eﬀects from shock emission for important ions from He, C, N, O, Si, and P. Surprisingly, dielectronic
recombination turned out to play an essential role for the ionization balance of O iv/O v in stars (particularly dwarfs) with Teﬀ ∼
45,000 K. Finally, we investigated the frequency dependence and radial behavior of the mass absorption coeﬃcient, κν(r), important
in the context of X-ray line formation in massive star winds.
Conclusions. In almost all considered cases, direct ionization is of major inﬂuence (because of the enhanced EUV radiation ﬁeld),
and Auger ionization signiﬁcantly aﬀects only N vi and O vi. The approximation of a radially constant κν is justiﬁed for r & 1.2R
and
λ . 18 Å, and also for many models at longer wavelengths. To estimate the actual value of this quantity, however, the He ii opacities
need to be calculated from detailed NLTE modeling, at least for wavelengths longer than 18 to 20 Å, and information on the individual
CNO abundances has to be present.

1. Introduction

Most of our knowledge about the physical parameters of hot
stars has been inferred by means of quantitative spectroscopy,
i.e., the analysis of stellar spectra based on atmospheric models.
The computation of such models is quite challenging, mostly be-
cause of the intense radiation ﬁelds of hot stars leading to various
eﬀects that are absent in the atmospheres of cooler ones, such
as the requirement for a kinetic equilibrium description (also
simply called NLTE = non-LTE) and the presence of strong,
radiation-driven winds.

In recent decades, a number of numerical codes have
been developed which enable the calculation of synthetic pro-
ﬁles/spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from such hot stars.
Apart from plane-parallel, hydrostatic codes that can be used to
analyze those atmospheres which are less aﬀected by the wind
(e.g., tlusty, Hubeny 1998; Detail/Surface, Giddings 1981,
Butler & Giddings 1985), all of these codes apply the concept

of uniﬁed (or global) model atmospheres (Gabler et al. 1989)
which aims at a consistent treatment of both photosphere and
wind, i.e., including (steady-state) mass loss and velocity ﬁelds.
Examples of such codes are CMFGEN (Hillier & Miller 1998),
PHOENIX (Hauschildt 1992), PoWR (Gr¨afener et al. 2002),
WM-basic (Pauldrach et al. 2001) and FASTWIND (Puls et al.
2005, Rivero Gonz´alez et al. 2012a).1 A brief comparison of
these diﬀerent codes can be found in Puls (2009).

In the present paper, we report on recent progress to improve
the capabilities of FASTWIND, which is widely used to analyze
the optical spectra of hot massive stars (e.g., in the context of
the VLT-flames survey of massive stars, Evans et al. 2008, and
the VLT-flames Tarantula Survey, Evans et al. 2011). One of the
most challenging aspects of these surveys was the analysis of the
atmospheric nitrogen content (processed in the stellar core by the
CNO-cycle and transported to the outer layers by rotational mix-

that will be referred to later on has been designed to calculate the wind
properties, and has not been used for diagnostic purposes so far.

ing), in order to derive stringent constraints for up-to-date evo-
lutionary calculations. Though the optical nitrogen analysis of
B-stars (dwarfs and supergiants with not too dense winds) could
still be performed by a hydrostatic code (in this case TLUSTY,
e.g., Hunter et al. 2007, 2008), a similar analysis of hotter stars
with denser winds required the application of uniﬁed model at-
mospheres, due to the wind impact onto the strategic nitrogen
lines (Rivero Gonz´alez et al. 2011, 2012a, Martins et al. 2012).
Moreover, because of the complexity of the involved processes,
the precision of the derived nitrogen abundances2 is still ques-
tionable. To independently check this precision and to obtain fur-
ther constraints, a parallel investigation of the carbon (and oxy-
gen) abundances is urgently needed, since at least the N/C abun-
dance ratio as a function of N/O might be predicted almost inde-
pendent from the speciﬁc evolutionary scenario (Przybilla et al.
2010), and thus allows individually derived spectroscopic abun-
dances to be tested (see also Martins et al. 2015a).

As shown by Martins & Hillier (2012), however, the optical
diagnostics of carbon in O-stars is even more complex than the
nitrogen analysis, since speciﬁc, important levels are pumped by
a variety of UV resonance lines. Thus, an adequate treatment of
UV lines (both for the optical diagnostics, but also to constrain
the results by an additional analysis of carbon lines located in
the UV) is inevitable. If at least part of these lines are formed in
the wind, the inclusion of X-ray and EUV emission from wind-
embedded shocks turns out to be essential (see below); this is
the main reason (though not the only one) for our current up-
date of FASTWIND. Other codes such as CMFGEN, PoWR,
and WM-basic already include these processes, thus enabling the
modeling of the UV (e.g., Pauldrach et al. 2001, Crowther et al.
2002, Hamann & Oskinova 2012) and the analysis of carbon
(plus nitrogen and oxygen, e.g., Bouret et al. 2012, Martins et al.
2015a,b for the case of Galactic O-stars).

X-ray emission from hot stars has been measured at soft
(0.1 to >∼ 2 keV) and harder energies, either at low resolution
in the form of a quasi-continuum, or at high resolution allowing
the investigation of individual lines (e.g., Oskinova et al. 2006,
Owocki & Cohen 2006, Herv´e et al. 2013, Leutenegger et al.
2013b, Cohen et al. 2014b, Rauw et al. 2015). Already the ﬁrst
X-ray satellite observatory, EINSTEIN, revealed that O-stars are
soft X-ray sources (Harnden et al. 1979, Seward et al. 1979), and
Cassinelli & Swank (1983) were the ﬁrst to show that the ob-
served X-ray emission is due to thermal emission, dominated
by lines. Follow-up investigations, particularly by ROSAT, have
subsequently allowed us to quantify X-ray properties for many
OB-stars (see Kudritzki & Puls 2000 and references therein).
Accounting also for more recent work based on CHANDRA and
XMM-Newton, it was found that the intrinsic X-ray emission of
‘normal’ O-stars is highly constant w.r.t. time (e.g., Naz´e et al.
2013), and that the level of X-ray emission is quite strictly re-
lated to basic stellar and wind parameters, e.g., Lx/Lbol ≈ 10−7
for O-stars (Chlebowski et al. 1989, Sana et al. 2006, Naz´e et al.
2011).

Such X-ray emission is widely believed to originate from
wind-embedded shocks, and to be related to the line-driven in-
stability (LDI, e.g., Lucy & Solomon 1970, Owocki & Rybicki
1984, Owocki et al. 1988, Owocki 1994, Feldmeier 1995).
In terms of a stationary description, a simple model (e.g.,
Hillier et al. 1993, Cassinelli et al. 1994) assumes randomly dis-
(consis-
tributed shocks above a minimum radius, Rmin ≈ 1.5 R
tent with X-ray line diagnostics, e.g., Leutenegger et al. 2013b,

cesses already at quite early stages (Rivero Gonz´alez et al. 2012b)

but see also Rauw et al. 2015) where the hot shocked gas (with
temperatures of a few million Kelvin and a volume ﬁlling fac-
tor on the order of 10−3 to a few 10−2) is collisionally ion-
ized/excited and emits X-ray/EUV photons due to spontaneous
decay, radiative recombinations and bremsstrahlung. The ambi-
ent, cool wind then re-absorbs part of the emission, mostly via
K-shell processes. The strength of this wind-absorption has a
strong frequency dependence. For energies beyond 0.5 keV (e.g.,
the CHANDRA-bandpass), the absorption is quite modest (e.g.,
Cohen et al. 2011), whilst for softer X-rays and the EUV regime
the absorption is signiﬁcant, even for winds with low mass-loss
rate (e.g., Cohen et al. 1996). In the latter case, only a small frac-
tion of the produced radiation actually leaves the wind.

This simple model, sometimes extended to account for the
post-shock cooling zones of radiative and adiabatic shocks (see
Feldmeier et al. 1997a, but also Owocki et al. 2013), is used in
the previously mentioned NLTE codes, particularly to account
for the inﬂuence of X-ray/EUV emission on the photo-ionization
rates.

Since the detection of high ionization stages in stellar wind
UV spectra, such as O vi, S vi, and N v (Snow & Morton 1976,
Lamers & Morton 1976, Lamers & Rogerson 1978), that cannot
be produced in a cool wind (thus, denoted by ‘superionization’),
the responsible mechanism was (and partly still is) subject to
debate. Because the X-ray and associated EUV luminosity emit-
ted by the shocks is quite strong, it can severely aﬀect the de-
gree of ionization of highly ionized species, by Auger ionization
(Macfarlane et al. 1993), and even more by direct ionization in
the EUV (Pauldrach et al. 1994, 2001). A ﬁrst systematic inves-
tigation of these eﬀects on the complete FUV spectrum, as a
function of stellar parameters, mass loss, and X-ray luminosity
has been performed by Garcia (2005).

In this paper, we present our approach for implementing
wind-embedded shocks into FASTWIND, to allow for further
progress as outlined above, and report on corresponding tests
and ﬁrst results. In Sect. 2, our model for the X-ray emission and
cool-wind absorption is described, together with the coupling to
the equations of statistical equilibrium. In Sect. 3 we present our
model grid which constitutes the basis of our further discussion.
Sect. 4 provides some basic tests, and Sect. 5 presents ﬁrst re-
sults. In particular, we discuss how the ionization fractions of
speciﬁc, important ions are aﬀected by X-ray emission, and how
these fractions change when the description of the emission (ﬁll-
ing factors, shock temperatures) is varied (Sect. 5.1). We com-
pare with results from other studies (Sect. 5.1.4), and investigate
the impact of Auger compared to direct ionization (Sect. 5.2).
We discuss the impact of dielectronic recombination in O v in
Sect. 5.3, and comment on the radial behavior of the mass ab-
sorption coeﬃcient (as a function of wavelength), an important
issue for X-ray line diagnostics (Sect. 5.4). Finally, we present
our summary and conclusions in Sect. 6.

2. Implementation of X-ray emission and absorption

in FASTWIND

Our implementation of the X-ray emission and absorption from
wind-embedded shocks follows closely the implementation by
Pauldrach et al. (2001) (for WM-basic, see also Pauldrach et al.
1994), which in turn is based on the model for shock cooling
zones developed by Feldmeier et al. (1997a) (see Sect.1). Except
for the description of the cooling zones, this implementation is
similar to the approaches by Hillier & Miller (1998) (CMFGEN)
(who use a diﬀerent deﬁnition of the ﬁlling factor, see below),

L.P. Carneiro et al.: FASTWIND – X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks

Oskinova et al. (2006) (POWR), and Krtiˇcka & Kub´at (2009,
hereafter KK09). In the following, we summarize our approach.

2.1. X-rayEmission

Following Feldmeier et al. (1997a), the energy (per unit of vol-
ume, time and frequency), emitted by the hot gas into the full
solid angle 4π can be written as3

ǫν = fX(r)np(r)ne(r)Λν(ne(r), Ts(r))

(1)

where np(r) and ne(r) are the proton and electron density of the
(quasi-)stationary, ‘cool’ (pre-shock) wind, Ts(r) is the shock
temperature, and fX(r) the ﬁlling factor related to the (volume)
fraction of the X-ray emitting material.4 Indeed, this deﬁnition
diﬀers from the formulation suggested by Hillier et al. (1993,
their Eq. 2), since we include here their factor5 16 into fX. This
deﬁnition is then identical with that used in WM-basic, POWR
(presumably6) and by KK09, whilst the relation to the ﬁlling fac-
tor used in CMFGEN, es, is given by
fX = 16 e2
s .

(2)

In principle, Λν is the frequency dependent volume emission
coeﬃcient (‘cooling function’) per proton and electron, calcu-
lated here using the Raymond-Smith code (Raymond & Smith
1977, see also Smith et al. 2001), with abundances from the
FASTWIND input, and neglecting the weak dependence on ne.
We evaluate the cooling function at a ﬁxed electron density,
ne = 1010 cm−3 (as also done, e.g., by Hillier et al. 1993 and
Feldmeier et al. 1997a), and have convinced ourselves of the va-
lidity of this approximation. We note here that the only spectral
features with a signiﬁcant dependence on electron density are the
forbidden and intercombination lines of He-like emission com-
plexes, and even there (i) the density dependence is ‘swamped’
by the dependence on UV photo-excitation, and (ii) in any case
the ﬂux of the forbidden plus intercombination line complex (f+i
lines are very closely spaced) is conserved.

Contrasted to the assumption of a hot plasma with a ﬁxed
post-shock temperature and density (as adopted in some of the
above codes), in our implementation we account for a tempera-
ture and density stratiﬁcation in the post-shock cooling zones,
noting that the decreasing temperature and increasing density
should signiﬁcantly contribute to the shape of the emitted X-ray
spectrum (Krolik & Raymond 1985). To this end, we adopt the
structure provided by Feldmeier et al. (1997a), and integrate the
emitted energy (Eq. 1) over the cooling zone,

ǫ ν = fX(r)np(r)ne(r)Λν(1010 cm−3, Ts(r)),

with

Λν(Ts(r)) = ±

(4)

where r is the position of the shock front, and Lc the spatial ex-
tent of the cooling zone. In this formulation, the ‘+’ sign cor-
responds to a reverse shock, and the ‘−’ sign to a forward one.
The functions f and g provide the normalized density and tem-
perature stratiﬁcation inside the cooling zone, and are calculated

3 The corresponding emissivity is lower by a factor 1/4π.
4 The actual, local pre-shock density may be diﬀerent from its quasi-
stationary equivalent, but this diﬀerence gets absorbed in the fX-factor.

(2006) also refer to Feldmeier et al. (1997a).

following Feldmeier et al. (1997a), accounting for radiative and
adiabatic cooling in the inner and outer wind, respectively (see
Sect. 2.3). We integrate over 1,000 subgrid points within Lc, ﬁnd-
ing identical results for both f (r) and g(r) as well as for Λν, com-
pared to the original work (Figs. 1/7 and 2/8 in Feldmeier et al.
1997a). Note that by setting f = g = 1, we are able to return to
non-stratiﬁed, isothermal shocks.

In our implementation, the (integrated) cooling function and
thus the emissivity is evaluated in the interval between 1 eV and
2.5 keV, for a bin-size of 2.5 eV. These emissivities are then re-
sampled onto our coarser frequency grid as used in FASTWIND,

tervals, thus enabling correct photo-integrals for the rate equa-
tions.

where u is the jump velocity, µ the mean atomic weight, and as
the adiabatic upstream sound speed. For simplicity, we calculate
the shock temperature from a more approximate expression, ne-
glecting the term in the square bracket, i.e., assuming the strong
shock scenario (u2 ≫ a2
s ):

Ts(r) =

(6)

To derive Ts, we thus need to specify the jump velocity u,
adopted in accordance with Pauldrach et al. (1994, their Eq. 3)
as

u(r) = u

∞(cid:20) v(r)
∞ (cid:21)γx

v

(7)

∞

where u
is the maximum jump speed which in our implemen-
tation is an input parameter (on the order of 300 to 600 km s−1,
corresponding to a maximum shock temperature, T ∞s ≈ 106 to
5 · 106 K for O-stars), together with the exponent γx (in the
typical range 0.5. . . 2) that couples the jump velocity with the
outﬂow velocity, controlling the shock strength. A parameteri-
zation such as Eq. 7 is motivated primarily by the observed so-
called ‘black troughs’ in UV P-Cygni proﬁles. Namely, when
modeled using a steady-state wind7, such black troughs can
only be reproduced when assuming a velocity dispersion that in-
creases in parallel with the outﬂow velocity, interpreted as a typ-
ical signature of wind-structure (e.g., Groenewegen & Lamers
1989, Haser 1995). Note, however, that Eq. 7 only represents
one possible implementation of the radial distribution of wind-
shock strengths, and that ultimately the user will be responsi-
ble for her/his choice of parameterization (see also discussion in
Sect. 6).

The last required parameter is the onset radius of the X-
ray emission, Rmin. This value is controlled by two input pa-
rameters, Rinput
min and a factor mx (the latter in accordance with
Pauldrach et al. 1994). From these values, Rmin is calculated via

Rmin = min(cid:0) Rinput

lines. Hillier et al. (1993) analyzed the sensitivity to Rmin, point-
ing to indistinguishable X-ray-ﬂux diﬀerences when the onset is
varied between 1.5 and 2 R
. Recent analyses of X-ray line emis-
sion from hot star winds also point to values around 1.5 R
(e.g.,
Leutenegger et al. 2006, Oskinova et al. 2006, Herv´e et al. 2013,
Cohen et al. 2014b), though Rauw et al. (2015) derived a value
of 1.2 R

for the wind of λ Cep.

2.2. X-rayabsorptionandAugerionization

Besides the X-ray emission, the absorption by the ‘cold’ back-
ground wind8 and needs to be computed.

In FASTWIND, the ‘cool’ wind opacity is computed in
NLTE, and to include X-ray absorption requires that we (i) ex-
tend the frequency grid and coupled quantities (standard9 opac-
ities and emissivities, radiative transfer) into the X-ray domain
(until 2.5 keV ≈ 5 Å), and (ii) compute the additional absorption
by inner shell electrons, leading, e.g., to Auger ionization. So
far, we included only K-shell absorption for light elements us-
ing data from Daltabuit & Cox (1972). L- and M-shell processes
for heavy elements – which are also present in the considered
energy range – have not been incorporated until now, but would
lead to only marginal eﬀects, as test calculations by means of
WM-basic have shown.

We checked that the K-shell opacities by Daltabuit & Cox
(1972) are quite similar (with typical diﬀerences less than
5%)
from
Verner & Yakovlev (1995), at least in the considered energy
range (actually, even until 3.1 keV).10

to the alternative and more ‘modern’ dataset

The reader may note that though the provided dataset in-
cludes K-shell opacities from the elements C, N, O, Ne, Mg,
Si, and S, the last one (S) has threshold energies beyond our
maximum energy, 2.5 keV, so that K-shell absorption and Auger
ionization for this element is not considered in our model.

After calculating the radiative transfer in the X-ray regime,
accounting for standard and K-shell opacities as well as stan-
dard and X-ray emissivities, we are able to calculate the corre-
sponding photo-rates required to consider Auger-ionization in
our NLTE treatment. Here, we do not only include the tran-
sition between ions separated by a charge-diﬀerence of two
(such as, e.g., the ionization from O iv to O vi), but we follow
Kaastra & Mewe (1993) who stressed the importance of cascade
ionization processes, enabling a sometimes quite extended range
of ﬁnal ionization stages. E.g., the branching ratio for O iv to O v
vs. O iv to O vi is quoted as 96:9904 whilst the branching ratios
for Si iii to Si iv/Si v/Si vi are 3:775:9222, i.e., here the major
Auger-ionization occurs for the process III to VI. In our imple-
mentation of Auger ionization, we have accounted for all possi-
ble branching ratios following the data provided by Kaastra &
Mewe.

Finally, we re-iterate that in addition to such inner shell ab-
sorption/Auger ionization processes, direct ionization due to X-
rays/enhanced EUV radiation (e.g., of O v and O vi) is essen-
tial and ‘automatically’ included in our FASTWIND modeling.
The impact of direct vs. Auger ionization will be compared in
Sect. 5.2.

8 The optical depths inside the shocked plasma are so low that ab-

sorption can be neglected there.

9 = outer electron shell
10 The major reason for using data from Daltabuit & Cox (1972) was
to ensure compatibility with results from WM-basic, to allow for mean-
ingful comparisons. In the near future, we will update our data follow-
ing Verner & Yakovlev (1995).

2.3. RadiativeandAdiabaticcooling

As pointed out in Sect. 2.1, the shock cooling zones are consid-
ered to be dominated by either radiative or adiabatic cooling, de-
pending on the location of the shock front. More speciﬁcally, the
transition between the two cooling regimes is obtained from the
ratio between the radiative cooling time, tc, i.e., the time required
by the shocked matter to return to the ambient wind temperature,
and the ﬂow time, t f , the time for the material to cross Lc.11 In
the inner part of the wind, the cooling time is shorter than the
ﬂow time, and the shocks are approximated as radiative. Further
out in the wind, at low densities, tc ≫ t f , and the cooling is dom-
inated by adiabatic expansion (see also Simon & Axford 1966).
In our approach, we switch from one treatment to the other when
a unity ratio is reached, where tc/t f ∝ Ts(r)1.5r v2(r)/ ˙M. For typ-
ical O-supergiants and shock temperatures, the transition occurs
in the outermost wind beyond r > 50 R
, whilst for O-dwarfs
the transition can occur at much lower radii, r > 2.5 R
or even
lower for weak-winded stars.

∗

∗

Basically, each cooling zone is bounded by a reverse shock
at the starward side and a forward shock at the outer side. Time-
dependent wind simulations (e.g., Feldmeier 1995) show that in
the radiative case the forward shock is much weaker than the re-
verse one, and is thus neglected in our model. In the adiabatic
case, we keep both the reverse and the forward shock, and, be-
cause of lack of better knowledge, assume equal Ts for both com-
ponents (Θ = 1 in the nomenclature by Feldmeier et al. 1997a),
and an equal contribution of 50% to the total emission.

3. Model grid

In this section, we describe the model grid used in most of the
following work. In order to allow for a grid of theoretical models
that enables us to investigate diﬀerent regimes of X-ray emis-
sion for diﬀerent stellar types, and to perform meaningful tests,
we use the same grid as presented by Pauldrach et al. (2001)
(their Table 5) for discussing the predictions of their (improved)
WM-basic code.12 Moreover, this grid has already been used by
Puls et al. (2005) to compare the results from an earlier version
of FASTWIND with the WM-basic code.

For convenience, we present the stellar and wind parameters
of this grid in Table 1. For all models, the velocity ﬁeld exponent
has been set to β = 0.9. Note that the FASTWIND and WM-basic
models display a certain diﬀerence in the velocity ﬁeld13.

All entries displayed in Table 1 refer to homogeneous winds,
though for speciﬁc tests (detailed when required) we have cal-
culated micro-clumped models as well (i.e., assuming optically
thin clumps). We remind the reader that though clumping is not
considered in our standard model grid, a (micro-)clumped wind
could be roughly compared to our unclumped models as long
as the mass-loss rate of the clumped model corresponds to the
mass-loss rate of the unclumped one, divided by the square root
of the clumping factor.14

11 Expressions for these quantities can be found in Feldmeier et al.
(1997a), but see also Hillier et al. (1993).
12 This grid, in turn is based on observational results from Puls et al.
(1996), which at that time did not include the eﬀects of wind inhomo-
geneities, so that the adopted mass-loss rates might be too large, by
factors from ∼3. . . 6.
13 WM-basic calculates the velocity ﬁeld from a consistent hydrody-
namic approach.
14 Note, however, that K-shell opacities scale linearly with density,
i.e., ∝ ˙M, and as such are not aﬀected by micro-clumping.

All models in the present work were calculated by means of
the most recent version (as described in Rivero Gonz´alez et al.
2012a) of
the NLTE atmosphere/spectrum synthesis code
FASTWIND,
including the X-ray emission from wind-
embedded shocks as outlined in Sect. 2. Let us further point
out that FASTWIND calculates the temperature structure (of the
photosphere and ‘cold’ wind) from the electron thermal balance
(Kub´at et al. 1999), and its major inﬂuence in the wind is via
recombination rates. In most cases, this temperature structure
is only slightly or moderately aﬀected by X-ray/EUV emission,
since the overall ionization balance with respect to main ioniza-
tion stages15 remains rather unaﬀected (see Sect. 5), except for
extreme X-ray emission parameters. In any case, the change of
the net ionization rates for ions with edges in the soft X-ray/EUV
regime is dominated by modiﬁed photo-rates (direct and Auger
ionization), whilst the changes of recombination rates (due to a
modiﬁed temperature) are of second order.

In FASTWIND, we used detailed model atoms for H, He,
and N (described by Puls et al. 2005 and Rivero Gonz´alez et al.
2012a) together with C, O, P (from the WM-basic data base, see
Pauldrach et al. 2001) and Si (see Trundle et al. 2004) as ‘ex-
plicit’ elements. Most of the other elements up to Zn are treated
as background elements. For a description of FASTWIND
and the philosophy of explicit and background elements, see
Puls et al. (2005) and Rivero Gonz´alez et al. (2012a).

In brief, explicit elements are those used as diagnostic tools
and treated with high precision, by detailed atomic models and
by means of comoving frame transport for all line transitions.
The background elements (i.e., the rest) are needed ‘only’ for the
line-blocking/blanketing calculations, and are treated in a more
approximate way, using parameterized ionization cross-sections
following Seaton (1958) and a comoving frame transfer only for
the most important lines, whilst the weaker ones are calculated
by means of the Sobolev approximation.

We employed solar abundances from Asplund et al. (2009),

together with a helium abundance, by number, NHe/NH = 0.1.

Besides the atmospheric and wind parameters displayed in
Table 1, our model of X-ray emission requires the following ad-

15 which dominate the heating/cooling of the cold wind plasma via
corresponding free-free, bound-free and collisional (de-)excitation pro-
cesses

4. Tests

In this section, we describe some important tests of our imple-
mentation, including a brief parameter study. A comparison to
similar studies with respect to ionization fractions (also regard-
ing the impact of Auger ionization) will be provided in Sect. 5.
Of course, we have tested much more than described in the fol-
lowing sections, e.g.,

(i) the impact of γx (see also Pauldrach et al. 2001), par-
ticularly when setting γx to zero (and consequently forcing all
shocks, independent of their position, to emit at the maximum
shock temperature, T ∞s ). In this case and compared to our stan-
dard grid with γx = 1, the dwarf models cooler than 50 kK dis-
play a ﬂux increase of 2 dex shortward of 100 Å (already for D50
this increase is barely noticeable), whilst the supergiant models
display a similar increase, but for wavelengths around 10 Å and
below. In terms of ionization fractions, setting γx to zero results
in an increase of highly ionized species (e.g., O vi and N vi) by
roughly one dex, from the onset of X-ray emission throughout
the wind. For all other dwarf models, this increase appears only
. The same eﬀect is present in the supergiant mod-
out to ∼4.0 R
els, but for a smaller radial extent.

∗

(ii) We compared the ionization fractions of important atoms
when either treated as explicit (i.e., ‘exact’) or as background
(i.e, approximate) elements (cf. Sect. 3), and we mostly found
an excellent agreement16 for the complete model grid.

(iii) During our study on the variations of the mass absorp-
tion coeﬃcient with Teﬀ and r in the X-ray regime (see Sect. 5.4),
we also compared our opacities with those predicted by KK09
(their Fig. 15, displaying mass absorption coeﬃcient vs. wave-
length), and we were able to closely reproduce their results, at
least shortward of 21 Å (including the dominating O iv/O v K-
shell edge), but our model produces lower opacities on the long-
ward side, thus indicating a diﬀerent He ionization balance (see
Sect. 5.4). When comparing the averaged (between 1.5 and 5 R
)
∗
absorption coeﬃcients in the wavelength regime shortward of
30 Å, KK09 found a slight decrease of 8% after including X-rays
in their models, because of the induced ionization shift. This is
consistent with our ﬁndings, which indicate, for the same range
of r and λ, a decrease by 9%.

16 In all cases, the agreement was at least satisfactory.

dotted lines refer to the He ii, C ii, and N iii ionization edges, re-
spectively.

4.1. Impactofvariousparameters

First, we study the impact of various parameters on the emergent
(soft) X-ray ﬂuxes, in particular Rmin, fX, and T ∞s . For these tests,
we used the model S30 (see Table 1, similar to the parameters
of α Cam (HD 30614, O9.5Ia)) since the latter object has been
carefully investigated by Pauldrach et al. (2001, their Table 9) as
well.

Before going into further details, let us clarify that the soft
X-ray and EUV shock emission are composed almost entirely of
narrow lines, and that the binning and blending make the spectral
features look more like a pseudo-continuum, which is clearly
visible in the following ﬁgures (though most of them display the
emergent ﬂuxes, and not the emissivities themselves).17

Impact of Rmin. The sensitivity of the X-ray ﬂuxes on Rmin is
displayed in Fig. 1, where the other parameters were ﬁxed at
their center values within our small X-ray grid (i.e., fX = 0.03
and T ∞s = 3·106 K18).
Indeed, the only visible diﬀerences are present in the range
between the He ii edge and roughly 330 Å. Shortward of the He ii
edge, all ﬂuxes are identical (though only shown down to 100 Å,
to allow for a better resolution), since the (cool) wind becomes
optically thick already far out in the wind at these wavelengths
(He ii, O iv, etc. continua, and K-shell processes). For λ ¿ 350 Å,
on the other hand, the shock emissivity becomes too low to be
of signiﬁcant impact.

In this context, it is interesting to note that in ǫ CMa (B2II,
the only massive hot star with EUVE data) the observed EUV
emission lines in the range between 228 to 350 Å each have a lu-
minosity comparable to the total X-ray luminosity in the ROSAT
bandpass (Cassinelli et al. 1995), which stresses the importance
of this wavelength region also from the observational side.

17 As shown by Pauldrach et al. (1994), the total shock emissivity is
roughly a factor of 50 larger than the corresponding hot plasma free-free
emission from hydrogen and helium.
18 Note that particularly the shock temperature is quite high for such
a stellar model, but chosen deliberately to allow for somewhat extreme
eﬀects.

6

∗

In Fig. 2, we show the ratio of the shock emissivity to the
total emissivity (including averaged line processes and Thomson
scattering), evaluated at the outer boundary of the wind (solid)
and at 1.2 R
(dash-dotted), corresponding to the onset of X-
ray emission in this model. There are a number of interesting
features visible:
(i) The total emissivity in the outer wind is dominated by shock
emission from just shortward of the He ii edge until 2.5 keV (the
highest energy we consider in our models). The emissivity in the
lower wind, however, is dominated by shock emission only until
200 eV, whilst for larger energies the (local) shock contribution
decreases drastically, because the assumed shock temperatures
)2) are rather low here (<∼ 100 kK). The question
(∝ (v(r)/v
is then: Which processes dominate the total emissivity at high
energies in the lower wind? Indeed, this is the re-emission from
electron-scattering, being proportional to the mean intensity, and
being quite high due to the large number of incoming photons
from above, i.e., from regions where the shock temperatures are
high! This eﬀect becomes also visible in the local radiative ﬂuxes
at these frequencies, which are negative, i.e., directed inwards.
(ii) Both in the outer and inner wind, the shock emission is
also signiﬁcant longward from the He ii edge, until λ ≈ 350 Å,
thus inﬂuencing the ionization balance of important ions. Whilst
the ﬂuxes of models without shock emission and those with
display a signiﬁcant absorption edge for C iii and
Rmin >∼ 2R
N iii (see Fig. 1), these edges have almost vanished in the mod-
els with Rmin = 1.2 . . . 1.5 R
, because of the dominant shock
emissivity increasing the degree of ionization. Even more, all
models display ﬂuxes in this region which lie well above those
from models without shock emission, because of the higher ra-
diation temperatures compared to the cool wind alone.
(iii) Beyond 350 Å, the shock emissivity becomes almost irrel-
evant (below 10%), so that the corresponding ﬂuxes are barely
aﬀected.
(iv) For the two models with Rmin = 1.2 and 1.5 R
, a prominent
emission feature between roughly 300 and 320 Å is visible in
Fig. 1. A comparison with Fig. 2 (note the box) shows that this

emission is due to dominating shock emission of the lower wind,
increasing the temperatures of the radiation ﬁeld beyond those of
the unshocked wind.

Coming back to Fig. 1, signiﬁcant ﬂux diﬀerences between
the shocked and the unshocked models are visible for all values
of Rmin (even for Rmin = 2 or 10 R
) below λ <∼ 350 Å, par-
ticularly below the N iii and C iii edges, because of the higher
ionization.

∗

On the other hand, the models with Rmin = 1.2 and 1.5 R
∗
are almost indistinguishable, at least regarding the pseudo-
continuum ﬂuxes. This turns out to be true also for He ii 1640
and He ii 4686, though these lines become sensitive to the choice
of Rmin if we change Rmin from 1.5 to 2 R
, due to the diﬀerent
intensities around the He ii edge and around He ii 303 (Lyman-
alpha) in the line-forming region. We will come back to this
point in Sect. 5.1.2.

∗

Impact of fX. In Fig. 3, we investigate the impact of fX, which
has a most direct inﬂuence on the strength of the X-ray emission
(cf. Eqs. 1 and 3). Having more X-ray photons leads to higher X-
ray ﬂuxes/luminosities and to less XUV/EUV-absorption from
the cool wind, because of higher ionization stages. The latter ef-
fect becomes particularly visible for the model with fX = 0.1,
which was used to check at which level of X-ray emission we
start to change the overall ionization stratiﬁcation. Most impor-
tantly, helium (with He ii as main ion beyond 1.2 R
for S30
models with typical values 0.03 <∼ fX <∼ 0.05) becomes more
ionized, reaching similar fractions of He ii and He iii between
2.2 R
). And also the main ion-
ization stage of oxygen (which is O iv in S30 models with typi-
cal X-ray emission parameters) switches to O v between 1.8 R
∗
) when fX is set to 0.1. The change
(∼0.4 v
in the ionization of helium (and oxygen) becomes clearly visi-
ble in the much weaker He ii edge and much higher ﬂuxes in the
wavelength range below 228 Å, compared to models with lower
fX.

Impact of T ∞s . As displayed in Fig. 4 (see also Pauldrach et al.
2001), the change in the maximum shock temperature, T ∞s , be-
comes mostly visible for the ﬂuxes shortward of ≈ 60 Å (of
course, the hard X-ray band is even more aﬀected, but not con-
sidered in our models). Though for the highest maximum shock
temperature considered here, T ∞s = 5 · 106 K (corresponding to
∞ ≈ 590 km s−1), we signiﬁcantly increase the population of
u
the higher ionized atomic species, this is still not suﬃcient to
change the main ionization stages present in the wind.

4.2. Scalingrelationsfor Lx

From analytical
considerations, Owocki & Cohen (1999)
showed that for a constant volume ﬁlling factor (and neglecting
eﬀects of radiative cooling, see also below) the optically thin19
wind X-ray luminosity depends on the square of the mass-loss
rate, Lx ∝ ( ˙M/v
)2, whilst the X-ray luminosity of optically
thick winds scales linearly with the mass-loss rate, Lx ∝ ˙M/v
,
∞
provided that one compares models with the same shock
temperatures and assumes a spatially constant X-ray ﬁlling
factor. These relations become somewhat modiﬁed if there is a
dependence of Ts on the wind terminal velocity, as adopted in
our ‘standard’ X-ray description (see also KK09).

∞

Note, however, that in a more recent study, Owocki et al.
(2013) derived, again from analytic considerations, scaling re-
lations for Lx for radiative and adiabatic shocks embedded in a
cool wind. At ﬁrst glance, their assumptions seem quite similar
to those adopted by Feldmeier et al. (1997a) (which is the basis
of our treatment), but in the end they predict diﬀerent scaling
relations for radiative shocks than resulting from the modeling
here. This discrepancy might lead to somewhat diﬀerent scal-
ing relations for Lx, and needs to be investigated in forthcom-
ing work; for now, we simply compare our models to the earlier
results by Owocki & Cohen (1999) (a similar test was done by
KK09).

To this end, we calculated S30, S40 and S50 wind models
with a ﬁxed X-ray description: fX = 0.025, mx = 20, and γx = 0.5.
For our tests we used, for all models, a constant maximum jump

check the predicted behavior for optically thin (red and green)

of models S50 (turquoise squares) from the predicted optically
thin scaling, when integrating until 100 eV, due to ‘normal’ stel-
lar/wind radiation just in this energy range. (See text.)

For these models (with parameters, except for

yr−1 on, the wind becomes successively
optically thick at higher and higher energies (though, e.g., for
˙M= 10−6M
yr−1 it is still optically thin below ∼ 10 Å, i.e., above
⊙
1.24 keV). Indeed, the X-ray luminosities of our corresponding
models are linearly dependent on ( ˙M/v
), as can be seen in Fig. 5
by comparing with the black dashed line. For lower ˙M, the wind
is optically thin at most high energy frequencies, and also here
our results follow closely the predictions (Lx ∝ ( ˙M/v
)2), when
comparing with the red or green dashed lines.

A second ﬁnding of Fig. 5 relates to the optically thin scal-
ing for model S50, when either starting the integration at 100 eV
(turquoise squares) or at 350 eV (red squares). Whilst for S30
(asterisks) and S40 (triangles) the X-ray luminosities just in-
crease by roughly one dex when including the range from 100
to 350 eV but still follow the predicted scaling relation, the S50
models show an increase of four orders of magnitude for the
lowest ˙M/v

dictions).

been marked by dotted vertical lines. Beyond 150 eV, all mod-
els, independent of their speciﬁc parameters, display the same
scaled ﬂuxes, thus verifying the optically thin scaling of X-ray
luminosities (in this case, only with respect to v
). For the S50
model, however, the energy range below 150 eV (and, for other
parameter-sets, also below even higher energies) is contaminated
by ‘normal’ stellar/wind radiation (which increases as function
of Teﬀ; see also Macfarlane et al. 1994, their Fig. 5), leading to
the strong deviation from the optically thin X-ray scaling law as
visible in Fig. 5. In so far, the total X-ray luminosity (regard-
ing the wind emission) of hotter objects might be overestimated
when integrating until 100 eV.

∞

In summary, we conclude that our implementation follows
the predicted scaling relations, but we also suggest to choose a
lower (in energy) integration limit of 0.15 keV (or even 0.3 keV,
to be on the safe side) when comparing the X-ray luminosities
of diﬀerent stars (both with respect to models and observations).
In this context, we note that there is a clear distinction be-
tween the observable soft X-ray and the longer-wavelength, soft
X-ray and XUV/EUV emission that is almost never directly ob-
served, but – as already outlined – is very important for pho-
toionizing relevant ions. ‘Modern’ X-ray observatories such as
XMM-Newton/RGS and CHANDRA/HETG do not have a re-
sponse below 0.35 keV and 0.4 keV, respectively20, and even a
modest ISM column makes it functionally impossible to see X-
ray emission below 0.5 keV.

4.3. ComparisonwithWM-basic models

Finally, we checked also the quantitative aspect of our results,
by comparing with analogous21 WM-basic models. As already

20 though ROSAT observed down to 0.1 keV, and also EUVE made a
few important measurements relevant for massive stars, in particular for
ǫ CMa (B2II), e.g., Cassinelli et al. (1995)
21 remember the diﬀerence in the velocity ﬁelds

pointed out, the X-ray description in both codes is quite similar,
and there is only one major diﬀerence. In WM-basic, the user has
to specify a certain value for Lx/LBol (e.g., 10−7 as a prototypi-
cal value), and the code determines iteratively the corresponding
fX, whilst the latter parameter is a direct input parameter in the
updated version of FASTWIND. In both cases, we used a fre-
quency range between 0.1 to 2.5 keV.

∞/v

Thus, we ﬁrst calculated WM-basic models with stellar/wind
parameters from Table 1, and with X-ray emission parameters
from Table 2. For the maximum jump velocity we assumed, as
∞ = 0.3, together with X-ray luminosi-
an extreme value, u
ties as displayed in the sixth column of Table 2. These values
then correspond to the fX values provided in the second column
of the same table, acquired from the WM-basic output. We note
here that the input values of Lx/LBol (to WM-basic) were not cho-
sen on physical grounds, but were estimated in such a way as to
result in similar values for fX, in the range between 0.01 to 0.03.
To check the overall consistency, we calculated a similar set
of FASTWIND models, now using the fX values from Table 2
as input. In case of consistent models, the resulting Lx values
(from the output) should be the same as the corresponding input
values used for WM-basic. Both these values are compared in the
last two columns of Table 2. Obviously, the agreement is quite
good (not only for the supergiants, but also for the dwarfs), with
diﬀerences ranging from 0.0 to 0.2 dex, and an average deviation
of 0.13 dex.

In a second step, we compared the ﬂuxes resulting from this
procedure in Fig. 7. For clarity, the ﬂuxes were shifted by −3,
−6, −9, and −18 dex (S35, S40, S45, S50), where the solid lines
correspond to the FASTWIND and the dashed lines to the WM-
basic results.

The comparison shows a remarkably good agreement, with
no striking diﬀerences. Smaller diﬀerences in the lower wave-
length range (λ < 100 Å) are related to a diﬀerent frequency
sampling (without an eﬀect on the total X-ray luminosity). At
longer wavelengths, these diﬀerences are related to the fact that
WM-basic provides high-resolution ﬂuxes, whilst FASTWIND
calculates ﬂuxes using averaged line-opacities22. Most impor-

for supergiant models (see Table 1 and Table 2). The solid lines
refer to results from our updated version of FASTWIND, and the
dashed ones to WM-basic results (Pauldrach et al. 1994, 2001).
For clarity, the S35, S40, S45, and S50 model ﬂuxes have been
shifted by −3, −6, −9, and −18 dex, respectively.

tant, however, is our ﬁnding that the ﬂuxes are not only similar at
high frequencies (indicating similar emissivities and cool-wind
opacities), but also longward from the He ii edge, indicating a
similar ionization equilibrium (modiﬁed in the same way by the
emission from shocked material).

At this stage, we conclude that our implementation provides
results that are in excellent agreement with the alternative code
WM-basic, both with respect to integrated ﬂuxes as well as fre-
quency edges, which moreover follow the predicted scaling re-
lations. Having thus veriﬁed our implementation, we will now
examine important eﬀects of the X-ray radiation within the stel-
lar wind.

5. Results

In this section, we discuss the major results of our model calcu-
lations. In particular, we study the impact of X-ray emission on
the ionization balance of important elements, both with respect
to direct (i.e., aﬀecting the valence electrons) and Auger ioniza-
tion. We also discuss the impact of dielectronic recombination
and investigate the radial behavior of the high-energy mass ab-
sorption coeﬃcient, an essential issue with respect to the analy-
sis of X-ray line emission.

Note that all following results refer to our speciﬁc choice
of the run of the shock temperature (see Eqs. 6 and 7), which,
in combination with our grid-parameter γx = 1, leads to shock
temperatures of Ts(v

5.1. Ionizationfractions

5.1.1. General effects

Though only indirectly observable (particularly via UV reso-
nance lines), ionization fractions provide useful insight into the
various radiative processes in the atmosphere. In the following,
we compare, for important ions (i.e., for ions with meaningful
wind lines), the changes due to the combined eﬀects of direct
and Auger ionization, whilst the speciﬁc eﬀects of Auger ion-
ization will be discussed in Sect. 5.2. These comparisons will be
performed for our supergiant (solid) and dwarf models (dashed)
from Table 1, and for the center values of our X-ray emission
parameter grid (Sect. 3), fX = 0.03, T ∞s = 3 · 106 K, that are
prototypical in many cases.23 Comments on the reaction due to
diﬀerent parameters will be given in the next section. All ioniza-
tion fractions have been evaluated at a representative velocity,
v(r) = 0.5 v
, and are displayed in Fig. 8. To check the inﬂuence
of X-ray emission, one simply needs to compare the triangles
(with) and the asterisks (without X-ray emission).

Carbon. Though our model atom for carbon will be improved
soon, already the present one (from the WM-basic data base)
is certainly suﬃcient to study the impact of shock radiation. The
upper panels of Fig. 8 display the results, which indicate an eﬀect
only for ‘cooler’ supergiant models, with Teﬀ < 40 kK. For these
objects, C iii and C iv become somewhat depleted (less than a
factor of ten), whilst C v (which is, without X-ray emission, a
trace ion at 30 kK) becomes signiﬁcantly enhanced. For dwarfs
in this temperature range, only C v becomes increased, since the
emission (scaling with ρ2) is still too weak to aﬀect the major
ions.24 For models with Teﬀ > 40 kK, on the other hand, the
temperature is already hot enough that the ionization balance is
dominated by the ‘normal’ stellar radiation ﬁeld, and no eﬀect
due to X-ray emission is visible.

Nitrogen (2nd row) and oxygen (third row of Fig. 8) suﬀer
most from the inclusion of shock radiation. In the following, we
concentrate on the diﬀerences produced by X-ray ionization in
general, whilst in subsequent sections we will consider speciﬁc
eﬀects.

23 Note that such maximum shock temperatures might be too high for
models around Teﬀ= 30 kK, and that certain eﬀects (as discussed in the
following) might thus be overestimated in this temperature range.

24 But note that the actual ﬁlling factor in dwarfs might be much larger
than 0.03, e.g., Cassinelli et al. (1994), Cohen et al. (1997, 2008),
Huenemoerder et al. (2012).

10

L.P. Carneiro et al.: FASTWIND – X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks

Nitrogen. In the ‘cool’ range, the behavior of N iii, N iv and N v
is very similar to the corresponding carbon ions (i.e., a moderate
depletion of N iii and N iv, and a signiﬁcant increase of N v, par-
ticularly at Teﬀ between 30 and 35 K), whereas in the hot range it
is diﬀerent. Here, N iii and N iv continue to become depleted, but
N v increases only as long as Teﬀ < 45 kK, and decreases again
at 45 and 50 kK. In other words, when N v is already the main
ion for non-X-ray models, it becomes (slightly) depleted when
the X-rays are switched on, in contrast to C v which remains un-
modiﬁed beyond 40 kK. This diﬀerence, of course, relates to the
fact that C v has a stable noble-gas (He-) conﬁguration, with a
high-lying ionization edge (31.6 Å), compared to the N v edge
at roughly 126 Å that allows for a more eﬃcient, direct ioniza-
tion by emission from the shock-heated plasma.
Oxygen. For almost every temperature considered in our grid,
the inclusion of X-rays has a dramatic eﬀect on the ionization of
oxygen. At 30 kK, O iv becomes the dominant ion25, when for
non-X-ray models the main ionization stage is still O iii, whereas
at the hot end O iv becomes somewhat depleted. The behavior of
O v is similar to N v (though the ﬁnal depletion is marginal), and
O vi displays, at all temperatures, the largest eﬀect. At cool tem-
peratures, the ionization fraction changes by 15 orders of magni-
tude, but even at the hottest Teﬀ there is still an increase by three
to four dex. As is well known, this has a dramatic impact on the
corresponding resonance doublet.
Silicon. In almost all hot stars, the dominant ion of silicon is Si v
(again a noble-gas conﬁguration), and Si iv forms by recombina-
tion, giving rise to the well-known Si iv luminosity/mass-loss ef-
fect (Walborn & Panek 1984, Pauldrach et al. 1990). The bottom
left panel of Fig. 8 displays an analogous dependence. Whilst for
dwarfs (low ρ2) no X-ray eﬀects are visible for Si iv, this ion be-
comes depleted for cool supergiants (Teﬀ <∼ 35 kK), at most by a
factor of ten.
Phosphorus. During recent years, it turned out that the observed
P v doublet at λ 1118,1128 is key26 for deriving mass-loss rates
from hot star winds, in parallel with constraining their inhomo-
geneous structure (Fullerton et al. 2006, Oskinova et al. 2007,
Sundqvist et al. 2011, ˇSurlan et al. 2013, Sundqvist et al. 2014).
Thus, it is of prime importance to investigate its dependence on
X-rays, since a strong dependence would contaminate any quan-
titative result by an additional ambiguity.

studies

As already found in previous

(e.g., KK09,
Bouret et al. 2012), also our results indicate that P v is not
strongly modiﬁed by X-ray emission (middle and right lower
panels of Fig. 8), though more extreme X-ray emission param-
eters, e.g., fX = 0.05 and/or T ∞s = 5 · 106 K, can change the
situation (see section 5.1.3). Even more, the apparently small
change in the ionization fraction of P v at typical X-ray emis-
sion parameters (decrease by a factor of two to three) can still be
of signiﬁcance, given the present discussion on the precision of
derived mass-loss rates (with similar uncertainties).

Regarding the ionization of P vi, cold models (30 and 35 kK)
change drastically when X-ray emission has been included, both
for supergiants and dwarfs. Since we ﬁnd less P vi in hot models
with shocks (compared to models without), this indicates that the
ionization balance is shifted towards even higher stages (P vii).
In this context, we note that Krtiˇcka & Kub´at (2012) inves-
tigated the reaction of P v when incorporating additional, strong
XUV emissivity (between 100 and 228 Å) and micro-clumping

into their models. The former test was driven by a previous study
by Waldron & Cassinelli (2010) who argued that speciﬁc, strong
emission lines in this wavelength range could be of signiﬁcant
impact. Indeed, Krtiˇcka & Kub´at (2012) were able to conﬁrm
that under such conditions27 P v becomes strongly depleted, in
parallel with changes in the ionization fractions of, e.g., C iv,
N iv, and O iv (see also Sect. 5.1.3). Further work is certainly
required to identify the source of such additional emissivity (if
present), and, in case, incorporate this mechanism into our mod-
els.

5.1.2. Impact on helium

During our analysis, we noted that also helium can be aﬀected by
shock emission (see also Sect. 4.1), a ﬁnding that has been rarely
discussed in related literature. In particular, He ii (and He i) can
become depleted in the intermediate wind, though only for our
‘cooler’ supergiant models with 30 kK <∼ Teﬀ <∼ 40 kK. The eﬀect
is strongest for S30 models, but barely noticeable already at S40,
independent of the speciﬁc X-ray emission parameters. For all
our dwarf models, no changes are visible at all.

Figure 9 displays the helium ionization fractions for an S30
model with typical X-ray emission parameters, as a function of
local velocity. The depletion of He ii (and, in parallel, of He i
that is not displayed) is signiﬁcant in the region between 0.2v
∞
, and results from the increased ionization due
<∼ v(r) <∼ 0.8v
to the increased radiation ﬁeld (in the He ii Lyman continuum)
in models with shocks (note also the corresponding increase of
He iii).

∞

In Fig. 10, we compare the helium ionization fractions from
our solution and a corresponding WM-basic S30 model, but now
with X-ray emission parameters as tabulated in Table 2 (the ma-
jor diﬀerence is a ﬁlling factor of 0.02 instead of 0.03). Here, we
display the fractions as a function of τRoss, to enable a compari-
son of the photospheric regions as well. Again, the depletion of
He ii (now located between τRoss≈ 0.1. . . 0.01) is visible, and our
results coincide perfectly with those predicted by WM-basic.

25 this is also true for models with diﬀerent X-ray emission parameters
26 because it is the only UV resonance line(-complex) that basically
never saturates, due to the low phosphorus abundance

27 enhanced emissivity in the XUV range; note, however, that the lines
refered to by Waldron & Cassinelli (2010) are included in ‘standard’
plasma emission codes

Fig. 10. Helium ionization fractions as a function of τRoss, for
S30 models calculated by FASTWIND and WM-basic, both with
X-ray emission parameters from Table 2. The agreement is ex-
cellent.

Since the ionization balance changes already at quite low ve-
locities, this might aﬀect at least two important strategic lines,
He ii 1640 and He ii 4686.28 From Fig. 11, we see that this is
actually the case: He ii 4686 displays stronger emission, whilst
He ii 1640 displays a stronger emission in parallel with absorp-
tion at higher velocities, compared to the non-X-ray model (dot-
ted). This is readily understood since He ii 4686 is predominantly
a recombination line, such that the increase in He iii leads to
more emission; to a lesser extent, this is also true for He ii 1640.
The lower level of this line, n = 2 (responsible for the absorp-
tion), is primarily fed by pumping from the ground-state via
He ii 303. We have convinced ourselves that the increased pump-
ing because of the strong EUV radiation ﬁeld leads to a stronger
population of the n = 2 state (even if He ii itself is depleted), so
that also the increased absorption is explained.

however, changes a lot, as visible from the dash-dotted proﬁles
in Fig. 11. Except for slightly more emission (again because of
increased He iii in regions with r > 2R
), the diﬀerence to pro-
ﬁles from models without shock emission becomes insigniﬁcant,
simply because both lines predominantly form below the onset
radius.

5.1.3. Dependence on ﬁlling factor and shock temperature

As we have seen already above, each ion reacts somewhat dif-
ferently to the imposed shock radiation. In this section we de-
scribe how a change of important X-ray characteristics aﬀects
important ions. The ﬁgures related to this section are enclosed in
Appendix A. The upper ﬁgure on each page shows speciﬁc ion-
ization fractions with and without X-rays, as a function of Teﬀ,
for our supergiant and dwarf models (S30 to S50 and D30 to
D50, respectively). The ionization fractions have been evaluated
at the location where the impact of shock radiation is most evi-
dent for the considered ion. Each of these ﬁgures contains nine
panels, where both the ﬁlling factor and the maximum shock
temperature are varied according to our grid, i.e., fX = 0.1, 0.3,

28 Most other He ii and He i lines are formed in the photosphere, and
remain undisturbed.

set to its default value for all models. The lower two ﬁgures on
each page display the ionization fractions for our dwarf (left)
and supergiant models (right), evaluated at the same location as
above, but now overplotted for all values of fX (diﬀerent col-
ors) and T ∞s
(diﬀerent symbols), and without a comparison to
the non-X-ray case. Thus, the upper ﬁgure allows to evaluate the
X-ray eﬀects in comparison to models without shock emission,
whilst the lower two ﬁgures provide an impression on the diﬀer-
ential eﬀect, i.e., the range of variation.
Carbon. C iii and C iv are signiﬁcantly aﬀected in supergiant
models with 30 kK <∼ Teﬀ <∼ 40 kK, for intermediate to large val-
ues of fX and T ∞s . The depletion of C iii and C iv reaches a factor
of 10 (or even more) in cooler supergiant models when the high-
est values of X-ray emission parameters are adopted, which is
reﬂected in a corresponding increase of C v. On the other hand,
C iii and C iv are barely modiﬁed in supergiant models with the
lowest values of fX or T ∞s , which is also true for dwarf models
with any value of our parameter grid (see Figs. A.1/A.2). The
ionization fraction of C v increases also for the lowest values
of X-ray emission parameters, once more for the cooler models
(here, also dwarfs are aﬀected). C v remains unmodiﬁed beyond
40 kK due to its stable noble-gas conﬁguration, as previously
noted.
Nitrogen. The behavior of N iii, N iv and N v in the colder mod-
els is similar to the corresponding carbon ions, for all diﬀerent
X-ray descriptions. For higher Teﬀ, increasing fX enhances the
depletion of N iii and N iv in both supergiants and dwarfs, whilst
the impact of T ∞s
is rather weak. At the largest values of X-ray
emission parameters, both stages become highly depleted (one
to two orders of magnitude) for all models but D30 and D35.

Shock radiation is essential for the description of N v at al-
most any temperature, particularly for models with Teﬀ < 45 kK
(Figs. A.3/A.4). Here, the increase of N v (compared to non-X-
ray models) can reach 4 to 5 dex at the lowest temperatures.
At 45 kK, only a weak impact of shock radiation can be noted,
whilst for 50 kK a high depletion of N v for extreme parame-
ters values becomes obvious. Once more, the impact of fX is
more prominent than of T ∞s , mainly for the coldest models where
N v becomes enhanced by one order of magnitude when increas-

ing fX from 0.01 to 0.05 and keeping T ∞s constant. The hottest
models with moderate to high parameters ( fX >∼ 0.02 and T ∞s
>∼ 2 · 106 K) indicate that also N vi becomes strongly aﬀected by
changes in the X-ray ionization.
Oxygen. Independent of the X-rays description, the depletion of
O iv for hot models happens only in a speciﬁc range of the wind,
between 0.4 to 0.8 v
(similar to the case of He ii discussed in
the previous section). Also for X-ray emission parameters dif-
ferent from the central value of the grid, the behavior of O v is
still very similar to N v, where mainly the cold models are quite
sensitive to variations of fX (Figs. A.5/A.6). The shock radia-
tion increases the ionization fraction of O v by 5 to 6 dex (when
fX varies between 0.01 and 0.05, independent of T ∞s ) for the
coolest models, whilst these factors decrease as Teﬀ approaches
40 to 45 kK. Models with Teﬀ = 45 kK are barely aﬀected, in-
dependent of the speciﬁc X-ray emission parameters. Similar to
the case for N v at highest values of fX, T ∞s , and Teﬀ, the corre-
sponding depletion of O v points to the presence of a signiﬁcant
fraction of higher ionization stages.

(Figs. A.7/A.8).

As pointed out already in Sect. 5.1.1 (see also Sect. 5.2),
the X-ray radiation is essential for the description of O vi, which
shows, particularly in the cold models, a high sensitivity to both
fX and T ∞s
Silicon. Also when varying the X-rays description, Si iv still re-
mains unaﬀected from shock emission in dwarf models. On the
other hand, for cool supergiants (Teﬀ <∼ 35 kK), Si iv becomes
even more depleted when fX increases (though T ∞s has a negli-
gible inﬂuence). No variation is seen in Si v, as expected due to
its noble-gas conﬁguration.
Phosphorus. P v shows a sensitivity to both fX and T ∞s , but in
this case T ∞s
is more relevant. Though no diﬀerence between
models with and without shocks is seen for the lowest values of
T ∞s , particularly the supergiant models develop a depletion with
increasing shock temperature, even at lowest fX. As noted al-
ready in Sect. 5.1.1, for extreme X-ray emission parameters the
depletion of P v is signiﬁcant for all models (both supergiants
and dwarfs), except for D30 (Figs. A.9/A.10). Finally, even P vi
becomes highly depleted for hot models (Teﬀ >∼ 40 kK) at inter-
mediate and high values of T ∞s , which indicates the presence of
even higher ionization stages.

To summarize our ﬁndings: When increasing the values for
fX and T ∞s , the eﬀects already seen in Fig. 8 become even more
pronounced, as to be expected. For most ions, the impact of fX
appears to be stronger than the choice of a speciﬁc T ∞s
(provided
the latter is still in the range considered here), though P v and
O vi (for the cooler models) show quite a strong reaction to vari-
ations of the latter parameter. Overall, the maximum variation
of the ionization fractions within our grid reaches a factor of 10
to 100 (dependent on the speciﬁc ion), where lower stages (e.g.,
C iv, N iv, O iv and P v) become decreased when fX and T ∞s are
increased, whilst the higher stages (e.g., N v, O v, O vi) increase
in parallel with the X-ray emission parameters. Only for Si iv,
the impact of X-rays remains negligible in all models except for
S30 and S35.

5.1.4. Comparison with other studies

Since the most important indirect eﬀect of shock emission is the
change in the occupation numbers of the cool wind, it is worth-
while and necessary to compare the ionization fractions resulting
from our implementation with those presented in similar studies.
To this end, (i) we recalculated the models described
in KK09, (ii) compared with two models (for HD 16691

as a function of τRoss, for our model of HD 203064 at Teﬀ =

eters). In our implementation, P v is barely modiﬁed by the X-ray
radiation ﬁeld, whilst a considerable impact is seen for P vi.

CMFGEN and SEI29-ﬁtting to calculate/derive the ionization
fractions of phosphorus, and (iii) compared with the ionization
fractions predicted by WM-basic.

Regarding the ﬁrst point, we recalculated the 14 O-star mod-
els (in the temperature range between 30 and 40 kK) presented
by KK09, using parameters from their Tables 2 and 3, both with-
out and with shock emission ( fX = 0.02 and u
∞=0.3), by
means of FASTWIND, using H, He, C, N, O, Si and P as explicit
ions. Figure 12 shows our results for the ionization fractions of
selected ions, as a function of Teﬀ, and evaluated at v(r) = 0.5v

Indeed, there are only few ions which display similar frac-
tions over the complete temperature range of the O-star mod-
els considered by KK09 (which still misses the hotter O-stars
beyond 40 kK). For C iv, an agreement is present only for the
coolest regime (Teﬀ ≤ 32 kK) where both studies predict C iv
as the main ion, independent whether X-rays are present or not.
Whilst the fractions for non-X-ray models are comparable also
for hotter temperatures, the X-ray models by KK09 show a much
larger depletion of C iv (fractions of 10−2 to 10−3 for Teﬀ >
34 kK) than our models (still above 10−1).

For O vi, agreement between both results is present only at
the hottest temperatures, whilst between 30 kK < Teﬀ <∼ 37 kK
our models display a factor of ∼100 lower fractions, for both
the non-X-ray models and the models with shock emission. The
same factor is visible in the lower wind (v(r) = 0.05v
) for the
X-ray models, but the non-X-ray models are similar here.

are quite similar in most cases. The exception is N v for models
without shocks, where our results are lower (by ∼1 dex) in the
intermediate and outer wind (v(r) = 0.8v
For Si iv, both results fairly agree for the X-rays models,
though we do not see a signiﬁcant eﬀect from including the

shock emission in our calculations (in other words, X-ray and
non-X-ray models yield more or less identical results). In con-
trast, the models by KK09 indicate a small depletion of Si iv
when including the shock emission, by factors of roughly 2 to 3.
Thus, our non-X-ray models have less Si iv than those by KK09.

Again, phosphorus (in particular, P v) has to be analyzed in
more detail. Comparing the last two panels of Fig. 12 with Fig. 8
from KK09, we see that our ionization fractions for P v agree
with KK09 in the coolest models, and in the hottest models re-
garding P vi. In the other temperature ranges, however, diﬀer-
ences by a typical factor of 2 (regarding P v) and 2 to 5 (re-
garding P vi) are present. In their Fig. 12, KK09 display the ra-
dial stratiﬁcation of the phosphorus ionization fractions for their
model of HD 203064, whilst the corresponding results from our
implementation are shown in Fig. 13. Both codes yield quite
similar fractions for P iv and P v (with and without X-rays) in
the external wind. The same is true for P vi in the model with
X-rays, but we have considerably less P vi for the non-X-ray
model. Prominent diﬀerences are visible in the lower wind and
close to the lower boundary. We attribute this diﬀerence to a
boundary condition (in the models by KK09) at quite low op-
tical depths, where the electron temperature is still close to the

eﬀective one.30 Thus far, it is conceivable that quite a low ioniza-
tion stage (P iv) dominates their internal atmosphere (followed
by P v and negligible P vi), whilst in our case it is just the other
way round, and P vi dominates, because of the much higher tem-
peratures.

To check these discrepancies further, we compared our
results also with calculations performed with CMFGEN.
Particularly, we concentrated on two supergiant models at
roughly 35 kK and 40 kK (HD 163758 and HD 16691, respec-
tively), as described by Bouret et al. (2012). In these models, an
X-ray emitting plasma with constant shock-temperature, Ts(r) =
3·106 K, a ﬁlling factor corresponding to Lx/Lbol = 10−7, and an
onset radius corresponding to 200 to 300 km s−1 was used (J.-C.
Bouret, priv. comm.). In Fig. 14, we present our results for P iv
and P v which can be compared with their Fig. 10, displaying P v
alone. Though our models31 do not have identical parameters (in
particular, our shock temperatures increase with velocity), the
ionization fractions behave quite similar: In the cooler model
(solid), the ionization of P v decreases with velocity, and in the
hotter one (dashed), it increases outwards. This is because in the
cooler model, P v is the dominant ion at low velocities, recom-
bining to P iv, whilst in the hotter model P vi dominates at low
velocities, recombining to P v in the run of the wind. Of course,
there are some quantitative diﬀerences, particularly in the inter-
mediate wind32, but we attribute these to a diﬀerent stratiﬁcation
of the clumping factor, fcl, and to the diﬀerent description of the
X-ray emitting plasma (concerning the reaction of P v on various
X-ray emission parameters, see Fig. A.10).

As a ﬁnal test, we compared our solutions to the predictions
by WM-basic, using our dwarf and supergiant models (Table 1
and X-ray emission parameters from Table 2). The results are
displayed in Figs. B.1 and B.2 (Appendix B). Note that the range
of comparison extends now from 30 to 50 kK, i.e., to much hotter
temperatures than in the comparison with KK09.

Overall, the agreement between FASTWIND and WM-basic
is satisfactory, and all trends are reproduced. However, also here
we ﬁnd discrepancies amounting to a factor of 10 in speciﬁc
cases, particularly for Si iv. Typical diﬀerences, however, are on
the order of a factor of two or less. We attribute these discrep-
ancies to diﬀerences in the atomic models, radiative transfer and
the hydrodynamical structure, but conclude that both codes yield
rather similar results, maybe except for Si iv which needs to be
reinvestigated in future studies.

∞

In Fig. B.3 we see how some of the encountered diﬀerences
(compared at only one depth point, v(r) = 0.5v
, except for
N v) translate to diﬀerences in the emergent proﬁles. As pro-
totypical and important examples, we have calculated line pro-
ﬁles for N iv 1720, N v 1238,1242, O v 1371, O vi 1031,1037
and P v 1117,1128, and compare them with corresponding WM-
basic solutions for models S30, D40, S40, D50 and S50 (for
model D30, all these line are purely photospheric, and thus not
compared). Both the WM-basic and the FASTWIND proﬁles
have been calculated with a radially increasing microturbulence,
with maximum value vturb(max) = 0.1v
, which allows for re-
producing the blue absorption edge and the ‘black trough’ (see
Sect. 2.1) in case of saturated P Cygni proﬁles.

30 Indeed, we were not able to ﬁnd statements or ﬁgures related to the
photospheric structure of their models in any of the papers by Krtiˇcka
and co-workers, so our argument is somewhat speculative.
31 S35 and S40, but using a clumped wind with reduced mass-loss
rates to ensure comparable wind structures
32 J.-C. Bouret provided us with an output of the ionization fractions
for P iv and P v.

This comparison clearly shows that in almost all consid-
ered cases the agreement is satisfactory (note that WM-basic in-
cludes the photospheric ‘background’, whilst FASTWIND only
accounts for the considered line(s)), and that larger diﬀerences
are present only (i) for N iv and O v in the outer wind, where
FASTWIND produces more (N iv) and less (O v) absorption, re-
spectively, and (ii) for strong P v lines, where FASTWIND pre-
dicts higher emission.

5.2. ImpactofAugerIonization

include the eﬀects
All X-ray models discussed so far
from direct
and Auger ionization, which was shown to
play an important role for the ionization balance in stellar
winds (e.g., Cassinelli & Olson 1979, Olson & Castor 1981,
Macfarlane et al. 1994, Pauldrach et al. 1994). In the following,
we investigate the contribution of the latter eﬀect to the total
ionization in more detail, particularly since there is still a certain
debate on this question.

Figure 15 displays how speciﬁc ions are aﬀected through-
out the wind, for dwarf and supergiant models with diﬀerent
Teﬀ and typical X-ray emission parameters ( fX = 0.03 and T ∞s
= 3·106 K). Each ion is shown at three diﬀerent locations: v(r) =
0.3 v
(close to the onset of the shock emission), v(r) = 0.6 v
∞
(intermediate wind) and v(r) = 0.9 v

(outer wind).

∞

∞

Two general comments: (i) Signiﬁcant eﬀects are to be ex-
pected only for quite high ionization stages, since in the majority
of cases Auger ionization couples ions with a charge diﬀerence
of two (but see Sect. 2.2). E.g., C iv should remain (almost) un-
modiﬁed, since C ii is absent in O- and at least early B-stars,
and the K-shell absorption of C iv (with threshold at 35.7 Å),
resulting in the formation of C v (charge diﬀerence of one!), is
in most cases (but see below) negligible compared to the direct
ionization of C iv (with threshold at ∼192 Å for the ground-
state ionization; remember that the radiation ﬁeld is stronger at
longer wavelengths, which favors direct vs. Auger ionization).
In contrast, O vi should become signiﬁcantly aﬀected, since O iv
is strongly populated in O-stars, and the transition threshold for
the direct ionization from O v (at ∼109 Å) is now closer to the
K-shell edge. Consequently, the transition rates (depending on
the corresponding radiation ﬁeld) are more similar than in the
case of C iv.

(ii) In the same spirit, Auger ionization should become neg-
ligible, at least in most cases, for the hotter O-stars (see also
Sect. 4). Once Teﬀ is high, more direct ionization is present (be-
cause of the stronger radiation ﬁeld at the corresponding, lower-
frequency edges), and consequently the impact of Auger ion-
ization should decrease. Though this argumentation is basically
correct, the actual results depend, of course, also on the wind-
strength, since higher densities lead to more X-ray emission (for
identical fX), which increases the impact of Auger-ionization.
E.g., if we check for the behavior of N vi at 0.9 v
in Fig. 15, we
see that for D40, D45 and D50 there is indeed no eﬀect, whilst
for S40 and S45 Auger ionization still has a certain inﬂuence.

∞

Now to more details. At ﬁrst note that all ions from C, N,
O, Si and P that are not displayed in Fig. 15 are barely changed
by Auger ionization, with a maximum diﬀerence of ±0.08 dex
(corresponding to factors of 0.8 to 1.2) in the fractions calculated
with and without Auger.

For carbon, C v is the only ion which under speciﬁc con-
ditions becomes aﬀected by Auger ionization. As visible in the
ﬁrst line of Fig. 15, cold supergiant models display an increase of
C v in the outer wind when Auger is included, since in this case

L.P. Carneiro et al.: FASTWIND – X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks

Fig. 15. Ionization fractions of ions most aﬀected by Auger ionization, at diﬀerent depth points. All models have typical X-ray
emission parameters ( fX = 0.03 and T ∞s = 3·106 K). The triangles represent models including Auger ionization (standard approach,
similar to Fig. 8), and squares models without (i.e., ‘only’ direct ionization has been considered). Solid lines refer to supergiant
models, and dashed ones to dwarf models. For clarity, the ionization fractions of dwarf models have been shifted by one dex.

the radiation ﬁeld at the corresponding K-shell edge becomes
quite strong, compared to the radiation ﬁeld around 192 Å (see
Fig. 7). This increase is compensated by a similar decrease of
C iv, which, in absolute numbers, is quite small though.

N vi (second line in Fig. 15) is the only nitrogen ion where
larger changes can be noted. In cool dwarfs, it becomes inﬂu-
enced already at 0.3 v
, and also in the intermediate wind, which
is also true for model S30. In the outer wind, diﬀerences appear
clearly for all models, except for dwarfs with Teﬀ >∼ 40 kK. The
corresponding change in N iv, on the other hand, is marginal,
again because N vi itself has a low population, even when Auger
is included.

∞

O v behaves similar to N v (mostly no changes), but now a
weak eﬀect appears in the outer wind of cool supergiants (third
line of Fig. 15), and even for O vi (compare to the reasoning
above), changes in the lower and intermediate wind are barely
visible (if at all, then only for the S30 model, see last line of
Fig. 15). In the outer wind, however, considerable diﬀerences
in O vi (up to three orders of magnitude) can be clearly spotted
for all supergiants and cooler dwarf models, similar to the case
of N vi. Only for the hottest models, the eﬀect becomes weak.
Fig. 16 shows an example for an S40 model where the second-

most populated oxygen ion (O v) changes to O vi after the inclu-
sion of Auger ionization.

Finally, the K-shell edges for phosphorus (not implemented
so far) and silicon (with quite low cross-sections) are located at
such high energies (> 2 keV or > 6 Å) that the corresponding
Auger rates become too low to be of importance, at least for the
considered parameter range.

To conclude, in most cases the eﬀects of Auger ionization
are only signiﬁcant in the outer wind (for a diﬀerent run of shock
temperatures, they might become decisive already in the lower
or intermediate wind), and for highly ionized species. The ef-
fect is essential for the description of N vi and O vi, particularly
in the outer wind. Thus, and with respect to strategic UV res-
onance lines, it plays a decisive role only in the formation of
O vi 1031,1037 (but see also Zsarg´o et al. 2008).

5.3. DielectronicRecombinationofOv

After comparing the results from our ﬁrst models accounting for
shock-emission with corresponding WM-basic results, it turned
out that in a speciﬁc parameter range (for dwarfs around 45 kK)
both codes delivered largely diﬀerent ﬂuxes around the O iv edge

16

L.P. Carneiro et al.: FASTWIND – X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks

A series of studies had recently reconsidered the eﬀects
of DR with respect to nitrogen (Rivero Gonz´alez et al. 2011,
2012a,b), however no signiﬁcant eﬀects were found, particularly
concerning the formation of the prominent N iii λλ 4634-4640-
4642 emission lines that was previously attributed to DR pro-
cesses (Bruccato & Mihalas 1971, Mihalas & Hummer 1973).

Nevertheless, we subsequently included DR also into our
oxygen atomic model, and were quite surprised by the conse-
quences. Though in a large region of our model grid the changes
turned out to be negligible for the ﬂuxes, in all supergiant models
and in the dwarf models around 45 kK the ionization fractions
were strongly aﬀected, leading to a decrease of O v, typically by
a factor of 10 to 50.

For our most problematic D45 model, DR proved to be es-
sential to even predict the correct main ion throughout the wind,
and to produce a reliable SED around the O iv edge. Fig. 17 dis-
plays the impact of DR for this model. Indeed, the population
of every ionization stage becomes modiﬁed in the wind, but for
O iv this diﬀerence is large enough to change it to the main stage
of the model. The reason for such drastic impact in the region
around D45 is based on the fact that only here the X-ray ioniza-
tion is potentially able to allow for the dominance of O v (see
Fig. 8), which then can be compensated by quite strong dielec-
tronic recombination rates.35

Nevertheless, since in the majority of models O v becomes
severely depleted (see above), independent of whether it is a
main ion or not, and also O vi is aﬀected, this leads to consid-
erable changes in the corresponding UV lines. Thus, we con-
clude that DR is inevitable for a correct treatment of oxygen.
Moreover, because of this strong impact, the precision of corre-
sponding data needs to be re-checked.

As a ﬁnal remark, let us note that the inclusion of DR has also

an impact on non-X-ray models, but to a much lower extent.

5.4. MassAbsorptionCoefﬁcient

As already mentioned in Sect. 1, also the X-ray
line
emission (observed by means of CHANDRA and XMM-
Newton) has been modeled and analyzed during recent
years, by various groups. Such analysis particularly allows
us to obtain constraints on the presence, structure, and de-
gree of wind inhomogeneities at X-ray wavelengths (e.g.,
Oskinova et al. 2006, Sundqvist et al. 2012a, Leutenegger et al.
2013b), to independently ‘measure’ the mass-loss rates of O-star
winds (e.g., Herv´e et al. 2013, Cohen et al. 2014b, Rauw et al.
2015), and even to derive nitrogen and oxygen abundances36
(Oskinova et al. 2006, Zhekov & Palla 2007, Naz´e et al. 2012,
Leutenegger et al. 2013a). One of the assumptions made by var-
ious authors is to consider the mass absorption coeﬃcient of the
cool wind material, κν(r), as spatially constant, which simpliﬁes
the analysis (Owocki & Cohen 2006, Leutenegger et al. 2013b,
Cohen et al. 2014b). Other groups include detailed predictions
for the spatial and frequency dependence of κν(r), calculated by
means of POWR (e.g., Oskinova et al. 2006) or CMFGEN (e.g.,
Herv´e et al. 2013, Rauw et al. 2015), and there is an ongoing dis-

35 As an independent check of our ﬁndings, we also calculated WM-
basic models without DR, and they turned out to be consistent with our
non-DR models.
36 Primarily, these abundance determinations involve measuring the
strengths of corresponding emission lines in the soft X-ray regime,
maybe correcting them for absorption. Note, however, that this diag-
nostics is not a wind absorption diagnostics, but that absorption is only
a correction needed to derive line luminosities.

at ∼160 Å, which could be tracked down to completely diﬀer-
ent ionization fractions of oxygen. In particular, our models dis-
played more O v and less O iv than calculated by WM-basic.

After investigating the origin of this discrepancy, it turned
out that we, inadvertently, had not included the data for di-
electronic recombination33 (hereafter DR) in our oxygen atomic
model.34 Thus, DR processes had not been considered for oxy-
gen.

33 This process can be summarized as ‘the capture of an electron by
the target leading to an intermediate doubly excited state that stabilizes
by emitting a photon rather than an electron’ (Rivero Gonz´alez et al.
2012a).

cussion whether the assumption of a spatially constant κν is jus-
tiﬁed and in how far it aﬀects the precision of the deduced mass-
loss rates. Though Cohen et al. (2010, 2014b) have investigated
the variation of κν(r) and its inﬂuence on the derived parameters
based on selected CMFGEN-models (also accounting for varia-
tions in the CNO-abundances), a systematic study has not been
performed so far, and in this section we will do so.

At ﬁrst, let us consider why and under which conditions κν
should become more or less spatially constant. The prime reason
for this expectation is the fact that the K-shell cross sections (at
threshold and with respect to wavelength dependence) of the var-
ious ions of a speciﬁc atom are quite similar, and that the corre-
sponding edges (for these ions) lie close together. Provided now
that (i) all ions which are present in the wind are actually able
to absorb via K-shell processes, and (ii) that there are no ‘back-
ground’ opacities from other elements, κν(r) indeed becomes (al-
most) spatially constant, since the total opacity is then the simple
sum over the K-shell opacities from all contributing atoms,

with αk the elemental abundance, YHe the helium abundance
(both quantities normalized to hydrogen), and mH the hydrogen
mass. k denotes the atomic species, and j the ion, nk, j is the oc-
cupation number of ion (k, j), and σk, j ≈ σk the K-shell cross
section, being almost independent of j. In the last step of the
above derivation, we have assumed that the atmosphere consists
mostly of hydrogen and helium.

Thus, we have to check under which conditions restrictions
(i) and (ii) might no longer be valid. For the light and abundant
elements CNO, K-shell absorption is no longer possible for C v,
N vi and O vii. For these ions, only ‘ordinary’, outer-shell ioniza-
tion is present, but also here the cross-sections are not too dif-
ferent from the K-shell processes (both with respect to strength
and location of edge). Thus, even for highly ionized winds (hot
or with strong X-ray emission) where C v, N vi, and O vii are ac-
tually present somewhere, the above approximation is still jus-
tiﬁed. In so far, restriction (i) should play no role, since even
higher ionization stages are not too be expected to be signiﬁ-
cantly populated.

Regarding restriction (ii), the situation is diﬀerent. The prime
background is given by the He ii bound-free opacity, which
becomes strong in ‘cool’ and/or helium-recombined winds37,
where in the following we always refer to the recombination of
He iii to He ii. Note that already Hillier et al. (1993) showed the
importance of outer-wind helium recombination on wind opacity
and emergent soft X-ray emission.

Let’s check on the maximum inﬂuence of the He ii bound-
free opacity at important K-shell edges. For a crude estimate, we
approximate its frequency dependence by (ν0/ν)3 = (λ/λ0)3, and
assume the worst case that He ii is the only He ion present in the
wind. Then, a lower limit for the opacity ratio at speciﬁc K-shell

37 Additionally, the outer-shell ionization of O iv with edge at ≈ 160 Å
and the bound-free opacities from other, strongly abundant ions can play
a minor role, particularly if He ii is weak or absent.

cross sections of He ii, carbon (K-shell), and oxygen (K-shell),
respectively, we ﬁnd κC/κHeII(35 Å) >∼ 0.42 and κO/κHeII(20 Å) >∼
2.3. Thus, for cool and/or He-recombined winds, the He ii opac-
ity dominates at the carbon K-shell edge, whilst at the oxy-
gen edge the K-shell opacities are quite a bit larger than the
background. Thus, we would predict that somewhat below ≈
20 Å (beyond 620 eV) restriction (ii) becomes valid, and that
κν should become depth-independent. Vice versa, the mass ab-
sorption coeﬃcient should vary with radius longward from the
oxygen or carbon K-shell edge, whenever the background mass
absorption coeﬃcient varies, mostly due to changes in the He ii
ionization throughout the wind.

L.P. Carneiro et al.: FASTWIND – X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks

∗

∗

In the following, we discuss these issues by means of our
grid models – all of them with shock emission described by our
typical parameters (T ∞s = 3 · 106 K and fX = 0.03). In particular,
we will provide estimates for suitable means of κν, as a function
of Teﬀ.

Figure 18 displays contour-plots of the radial dependence of
the mass absorption coeﬃcient in a D30 (upper panel) and in an
S40 model (lower panel), as a function of wavelength. In accor-
dance with our expectation from above, in both panels we note
38 and the wavelength
that κν becomes constant when r >∼ 1.2 R
is lower than 20 Å (log λ <∼ 1.3).
Longward of the O iv K-shell edge (λ > 21 Å), the radial
variation of κν depends on eﬀective temperature and wind den-
sity. For the D30 model, κν increases signiﬁcantly with wave-
length, but nevertheless does not vary with radius, because in this
case the dominating ionization fraction of He ii remains constant
throughout the wind. In contrast, somewhat hotter models (e.g.,
D35), but particularly models with denser winds such as S40
display a diﬀerent behavior. Here, the lower wind is dominated
by He iii, so that the background is weak, and one can already
discriminate the C iv and C v edges around 10 R
(indicated as
dashed lines). Compared to the dwarf models, the total κν in the
inner wind is much lower, shows much more structure, and is
inﬂuenced by the carbon and nitrogen opacities. Once helium
begins to recombine in the outer wind, the background begins to
dominate again, and the K-shell features vanish.

Fig. 19 illustrates the radial variation of the mass absorption
coeﬃcient for diﬀerent wavelengths, and for our dwarf models
with Teﬀ from 30 to 50 kK. Independent of Teﬀ, the radial vari-
ation of κν is marginal at (and below) 10 Å. Around 20 Å, the
variations in the inner/intermediate wind (until 10 R
) are some-
what larger, due to changes in the oxygen ionization, where the
speciﬁc positions of the corresponding edges play a role (see also
Fig. 21). At 30 Å, we see a separation between D30 (black) with
high values of κν (He ii dominating), hot models with low values
of κν (C v + low background, since helium completely ionized),
and D35 (green) with a signiﬁcantly varying κν, due to the re-
combination of He iii in the external wind. At 40 Å, ﬁnally, the
behavior is similar, and only the κν values for the cooler models
are larger, because of the increasing He ii background.

The analogous situation for supergiants is shown in Fig. 20.
Whilst for dwarfs the variation of κν (when present) vanishes at
around 10 R
, here it is visible throughout the wind until large
radii, for all but the coolest (black) and the hottest (red) model.
Note that the limiting values (at the outermost radius) are simi-
lar to those of the corresponding dwarf models at Teﬀ = 30 and
35 kK (recombined) and at Teﬀ = 50 kK (He iii). In contrast, for
models with Teﬀ = 40 and 45 kK the opacity continues to in-
crease outwards, since the recombination is still incomplete.

Herv´e et al. (2013) provided a similar ﬁgure to investigate
the radial variation of κν, in this case for a model of ζ Pup calcu-
lated by CMFGEN. Though the stellar parameters roughly agree
with our S40 model, they considered a clumpy wind (with vol-
ume ﬁlling factor fV = 0.05), and nuclear processed CNO abun-
dances. Because this model shows an earlier recombination of
helium, a larger nitrogen and a weaker oxygen K-shell edge, the
actual values of κν are somewhat diﬀerent from our results (ex-
cept at shortest wavelengths), but the basic trends are quite sim-
ilar. In particular, our results support Herv´e et al. (2013)’s idea
of parameterizing the run of κν: In any of the κν(r)-curves dis-
played in Figs. 19 and 20, these curves either increase or slightly

tuations in the opacity background – is even lower.

decrease, but eventually reach a plateau from a certain radius on
(which diﬀers for each model). This radius then separates two
diﬀerent regimes of κν that might be parameterized in an appro-
priate way (see Herv´e et al. 2013 for details).

Instead of a parameterization, it is also possible to calculate
meaningful averages of κν and the corresponding scatter. The
size of this scatter then allows us to conclude when (w.r.t. wave-
length and Teﬀ) a spatially constant mass absorption coeﬃcient
might be used to analyze X-ray line proﬁles. Instead of a straight
average, we use here a density-weighted average (and a corre-
sponding variance), to account for the fact that the optical depth,
τν, is the quantity which needs to be calculated with high preci-
sion:

as a function of wavelength, averaged over the interval between

1.2 and 110.0 R
notes the relative standard deviation, √Var(κν)/¯κν. Also here,
cold and hot models are clearly separated, with D35 in between
(cf. with Fig. 19): for λ >∼ 21 Å, the cold models are aﬀected by a
strong He ii-background, whilst this background is weak for the
hotter ones. In this ‘long wavelength’ region, the radial variation
of κν is large for model D35, due to recombining helium. There is
also a considerable scatter between 18 and 21 Å, because of ra-
dial changes in the oxygen ionization. Overall, however, the as-
sumption of a constant mass absorption coeﬃcient (suitably av-
eraged) is not too bad for the complete wavelength range (scatter
below 20%), if we exclude model D35. Below 18 Å, the scatter
becomes negligible, except at the Ne, Mg, and Si edges.

Even if κν(r) can be approximated by a single number, ¯κν, the
question is then about its value. For a comparison, the dashed
appr
line in Fig. 21 displays the (analytic) estimate, κ
as provided
ν
by Eq. 9, using solar abundances and K-shell opacities only,
with cross-sections from C iv, N iv, O iv, Ne iv, Mg iv, and Si iv.
At least for the hotter models, this estimate is quite appropriate
when comparing to the actual case, except for a somewhat erro-
neous description of the carbon edge(s): Since C v dominates in
the hotter models and there is a ∼ 4 Å diﬀerence between the
C iv K-shell and the C v edge, this region is badly described by
our approximation. For the cooler models, on the other hand, the
diﬀerence between the dashed and the solid curves is (mostly)
due to the helium background, which varies as a function of
Teﬀ, log g, and wind-density, thus aﬀecting the actual value of
¯κν. Even below 18 Å, this background is still non-negligible for
model D30, with a maximum deviation of roughly 30% close to
the oxygen edge. Nevertheless, we conclude that for all dwarf

averaging process, and must not be confused with the onset radius of
the X-ray emission.

λ ≤ 18 Å (at least within our present assumptions, i.e., so-
lar abundances and unclumped winds with not too large optical
depths, such that the averaging down to 1.2 R
is reasonable;
∗
for diﬀerent models, see below). In all other cases, results from
NLTE-atmosphere modeling should be preferred.

The situation for our supergiant models is displayed in
Fig. 22. Below 20 Å, the situation is similar to the dwarf case,
though here the background is lower, even for the coolest model,
appr
ν might now be applied at all
and the approximation of ¯κν by κ
temperatures. For λ > 30 Å, however, almost all models (ex-
cept for S50) can no longer be described by a radially constant
κ, since all models with Teﬀ ≤ 45 kK show recombining helium
of diﬀerent extent, leading to strong variations throughout the
wind.

Thus far, we considered models with solar abundances and
unclumped winds. To illustrate the variation of the total and
K-shell opacities with abundance (already investigated for par-
ticular models by, e.g., Cohen et al. 2010, 2014b), the dotted

appr
ities, κ
, for the case of highly processed CNO material, based
ν
on the abundances derived for ζ Pup by Bouret et al. (2012).
Here, the carbon and oxygen abundances are depleted by 0.8
and 0.6 dex, respectively, whilst the nitrogen abundance is ex-
tremely enhanced (by ∼ 1.3 dex), compared to the solar values.
Such a composition leads to weak C and O K-shell edges, but to
an enormous nitrogen edge (dotted vs. dashed line).

L.P. Carneiro et al.: FASTWIND – X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks

Now, if the individual abundances are known during an anal-
ysis, there will be no problem, and κν might be approximated
appr
by either κ
below 18 Å or calculated by means of NLTE-
ν
model atmospheres, simply accounting for these abundances.
However, considerable uncertainties even in the low wavelength
regime might result when the abundances are not known. From
comparing the dashed and the dotted line, we estimate this un-
certainty as roughly 50% for ¯κν, and thus for τν and ˙M (when
the mass-loss rate shall be derived). A similar value has already
been estimated by Cohen et al. (2014b). In the range between
the oxygen and the carbon edge (20 to 35 Å), the situation is
even worse, and we conclude that the corresponding absorption
coeﬃcients are prone to extreme uncertainties when the abun-
dances have to be adopted without further veriﬁcation. In par-
ticular, getting κν right around 25 Å is important for measuring
the N emission lines at and near that wavelength (e.g., N vi 24.9,
N vii 24.78), and thus measuring the N abundance directly. But at
longer wavelengths, where κν will vary even more strongly with
radius, and even though nitrogen emission lines are not directly
aﬀected, the (direct) ionization of CNO etc. is aﬀected, and so
optical and UV line strengths are aﬀected too, as discussed in
the previous sections.

The impact of clumping is less severe. Comparing Fig. C.1
(Appendix) with Figs. 21 and 22, we see that models account-
ing for optically thin clumping (‘micro-clumping’) with typical
clumping factors41 and adequately reduced mass-loss rates give
rather similar results compared with unclumped models. Again,
the scatter of κν is negligible below 18 Å. ‘Only’ the region
longward of 20 Å is stronger contaminated by the He ii back-
ground, since the clumped models recombine earlier than the
unclumped ones. Note that the K-shell mass absorption coeﬃ-
cients themselves are not aﬀected by optically thin clumping,
since the opacities scale linearly with density.

∗

Finally, Fig. C.2 (Appendix) investigates the consequences
of averaging κν in the outer wind alone (in the interval between
10 and 110 R
), which would be adequate if the wind would be-
come optically thick at such radii (which for short wavelengths
and O-star winds is quite unlikely, because of the low value of
κν). Anyway, below 18 Å the diﬀerences to the original values
are small. Note that the hot dwarf models now behave almost
appr
, because He ii vanishes in the outer
exactly as estimated by κ
ν
regions of these objects.

Further conclusions on this topic are provided in the next

section.

6. Summary and conclusions

In this paper, we described the implementation of X-ray emis-
sion from wind-embedded shocks into the uniﬁed, NLTE atmo-
sphere/spectrum synthesis code FASTWIND, discussed various
tests, and presented some ﬁrst result.

Our implementation follows closely corresponding work by
Pauldrach et al. (2001) (for WM-basic), which in turn is based
on the shock cooling zone model developed by Feldmeier et al.
(1997a), with the additional possibility to consider isothermal
shocks. The (present) description of the shock-distribution and
strength is provided by four input, ‘X-ray emission parameters’,
controlling the ﬁlling factor, the run of the shock temperature,
and the radial onset of the emitting plasma. We account for K-
shell absorption and Auger ionization, allowing for more than
one ﬁnal ionization stage due to cascade ionization processes.

41

fcl = 20 corresponding to a volume ﬁlling factor, fV, = 0.05

Most of our test calculations are based on a grid of 11 models
(supergiants and dwarfs within Teﬀ= 30 to 55 kK), each of them
with 9 diﬀerent X-ray emission parameter sets, but many more
models have been calculated for various comparisons, including
models with optically thin clumping.

∗

A ﬁrst test investigated the reaction when varying impor-
tant X-ray emission parameters. For radially increasing shock-
strengths, the emergent ﬂux remains almost unaﬀected if the
onset radius is lowered compared to its default value (roughly
1.5 R
), whilst increasing the onset has a considerable eﬀect in
the range between ∼350 Å and at least the He ii edge. Filling
factor and maximum shock temperature aﬀect the ionization
fractions, particularly of the highly ionized species. We conﬁrm
some earlier predictions for scaling relations for X-ray luminosi-
ties (as a function of ˙M/v
) in the case of optically thin and thick
continua42, but we noted that for our hottest models these lumi-
nosities can become contaminated by ‘normal’ stellar radiation,
for energies below ∼150 eV. Thus, we suggested to choose a
lower integration limit of 0.15 keV (or even 0.3 keV, to be on the
safe side) when comparing the X-ray luminosities of diﬀerent
stars or theoretical models. Finally, we found an excellent agree-
ment between FASTWIND and WM-basic ﬂuxes, demonstrat-
ing a similar ionization balance, and a satisfactory agreement
between corresponding X-ray luminosities. Overall, the impact
of typical shock emission aﬀects the radiation ﬁeld in the wind
for all wavelengths λ < 350 Å, thus modifying all photo-rates
for ions with ionization edges in this regime.

∞

Investigating the ionization fractions within our model grid
allowed us to study the impact of shock radiation for the proper
description of important ions, i.e., those with meaningful wind
lines (e.g., C iv, N iv, N v, O v, O vi, Si iv, and P v). If we denote
models with Teﬀ = 30 to 35 kK as ‘cool’, models with Teﬀ= 35
to 45 kK as ‘intermediate’ and models with Teﬀ= 45 to 55 kK
as ‘hot’ (note the overlap), we can summarize our ﬁndings as
follows. Not (or only marginally) aﬀected by shock emission
(with typical parameters and our parameterization of the shock-
strengths) are

diate), Si iv, P v (cool+intermediate)

• in dwarfs: C iii, C iv, N iii (cool), N iv (cool), O iv (interme-
• in supergiants: C iii (hot), C iv (hot), N iv (cool), O iv (inter-

mediate), Si iv (hot).

In almost all other cases, lower stages (C iii, C iv, N iii, N iv,
O iv (hot), Si iv, and P v) are depleted, i.e., corresponding wind
lines become weaker, and higher stages (N v, O iv (cool), O v,
O vi) become enhanced, i.e., corresponding wind lines become
stronger when accounting for shock emission.

We studied in some detail how the ionization fractions
change when the two most important parameters, ﬁlling factor
and maximum shock temperature, are varied. For most ions, the
ﬁlling factor has a larger inﬂuence than T ∞s , but particularly O vi
and P v (the latter only for higher ﬁlling factors and shock tem-
peratures) show a strong reaction to both parameters.

Due to the importance of P v with respect to mass-loss and
wind-structure diagnostics, we re-investigated its behavior, and
conﬁrm previous results that for typical X-ray emission parame-
ters this ion is only weakly or moderately aﬀected (by factors of
two for intermediate and hot supergiants at v(r)/v
∞ = 0.5 and by
factors of 10 at v(r)/v
∞ = 0.8), though for a strong X-ray radi-
ation ﬁeld the depletion can reach much higher factors. A com-

42 though a discrepancy with recent work by Owocki et al. (2013) was
identiﬁed, which needs to be investigated further

21

L.P. Carneiro et al.: FASTWIND – X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks

parison of P v ionization fractions with results from CMFGEN
(Bouret et al. 2012) provided a reasonable agreement.

Not only metals, but also He can be aﬀected by shock emis-
sion, due to the location of the He ii edge and He ii 303 in the
EUV. Signiﬁcant eﬀects, however, have only been found in the
winds of cool supergiants, where particularly He ii 1640 (emis-
sion and high-velocity absorption) and He ii 4686 (emission) be-
come stronger, due to increased recombination cascades and in-
creased pumping of the n = 2 level in case of He ii 1640.

When comparing our ionization fractions with those calcu-
lated by WM-basic, we found a good, though not perfect, agree-
ment, which turned out to be true also for various UV-lines.
When comparing with Krtiˇcka & Kub´at (2009), on the other
hand, a similar agreement over the complete covered tempera-
ture range was found only for few ions; for the majority, such
agreement is present only at speciﬁc temperatures.

It is well known that Auger ionization can play an important
role for the ionization balance of speciﬁc ions. To further in-
vestigate this issue, we compared the ionization fractions of all
ions considered in this study when including (default) or exclud-
ing this process in our NLTE treatment. Overall, it turned out
that only N vi and O vi (as previously known) are signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by Auger ionization, but, at least in our models (with
radially increasing shock temperatures), only in the outer wind.
For the inner and intermediate wind, direct EUV/XUV ioniza-
tion due to shock emission dominates, which is generally true
for all other considered ions.43

As an interesting by-product of our investigation, it turned
out that dielectronic recombination of O v can have a consider-
able inﬂuence on the ionization balance of oxygen (O iv vs. O v),
particularly for dwarfs around 45 kK.

In the last part of this paper, we provided an extensive dis-
cussion of the (high-energy) mass absorption coeﬃcient, κν, re-
garding its spatial variation and dependence on Teﬀ. This topic
is particularly relevant for various approaches to analyze X-ray
emission lines. To summarize and conclude, we found that (i)
the approximation of a radially constant κν can be justiﬁed for
r >∼ 1.2R
and λ <∼ 18 Å, and also for many models at longer
wavelengths. (ii) In order to estimate the actual value of this
quantity, however, the He ii background44 needs to be considered
from detailed modeling, at least for wavelengths longer than 18
to 20 Å. Moreover, highly processed CNO material can change
the actual value of κν considerably, particularly for λ >∼ 20 Å,
and estimates for the optical depth, τν, become highly uncertain
in this regime if the individual abundances are unknown.

∗

In this context, it is reassuring to note that, e.g., the mass-loss
determinations by Cohen et al. (2014b) using X-ray line spec-
troscopy (via determining the optical depths of the cool wind
material, under the assumption of spatially constant κν) rely on
16 lines observed by CHANDRA, where 14 out of these 16 lines
are shortward of 19 Å. The issues summarized above will be a
much bigger problem for O vii and nitrogen X-ray emission line
measurements (O vii at 21.6-22.1 Å, N vii at 24.78 Å and N vi at
24.9 Å) that are planned to independently constrain, with high
precision, the nitrogen/oxygen content in (a few) massive O-
stars (Leutenegger et al. 2013a). To this end, a detailed modeling
of κν (particularly regarding the helium ionization) will certainly
be advisable for such an analysis.

Having ﬁnalized and carefully tested our implementation of
emission from wind-embedded shocks, we are now in a position
to continue our work on the quantitative spectroscopy of mas-
sive stars. As outlined in the introduction, we will concentrate
on determining the carbon and oxygen abundances in O- and
early B-stars observed during the two VLT-flames surveys con-
ducted within our collaboration, by means of optical and, when
available, UV spectroscopy. During such an analysis, the X-ray
emission parameters need to be derived in parallel with the other,
main diagnostics, at least in principle. We then have to check in
how far the derived abundances depend on corresponding uncer-
tainties.

Note further that any such UV analysis also needs to con-
sider the eﬀects of optically thick clumping (e.g., Oskinova et al.
2007, Sundqvist et al. 2011, ˇSurlan et al. 2013, Sundqvist et al.
2014). In parallel with the implementation of wind-embedded
shocks presented here, we have updated fastwind to also account
properly for such optically thick clumping (porosity in physi-
cal and velocity space), following Sundqvist et al. (2014); these
models will be presented in an upcoming (fourth) paper of this
series.

Regarding quantitative spectroscopic studies accounting for
X-ray ionization eﬀects, the parameterization represented by
Eq. 7 is certainly not the ﬁnal truth, and actually also not the best
encapsulation of the results from present-day numerical simula-
tions. Though this probably does not matter too much for most
applications, it might be worth thinking about a better repre-
sentation, and how our results would change if the stronger and
weaker shocks were allowed to be more spatially mixed.

indi-
cate that the velocity dispersion peaks quite close to Rmin (∼
1.5-2.0 R
) and then falls oﬀ. And the same simulations show
also some strong shocks near Rmin. From the observational
side, f/i ratios of ions that form at higher temperatures (e.g.,
Si xiii)
indicate a substantial amount of high-temperature
plasma (∼107 K) near Rmin (e.g., Waldron & Cassinelli 2001,
Waldron & Cassinelli 2007), and Leutenegger et al.
(2006)
found an onset radius of 1.1+0.4/−0.1 R
for the S xv line. On
the other hand, Cohen et al. (2014a) showed that the shock
temperature distribution is very strongly skewed toward weak
shocks, and our parameterization Eq. 7 allows us to include that
feature already now.

Appendix A: Ionization fractions of selected ions:

Dependence on X-ray ﬁlling factor and shock
temperature

Figures A.1 to A.10 display the reaction of C iv, N v, O v, O vi,
and P v on varying the X-ray ﬁlling factors and shock tempera-
tures within our supergiant and dwarf models, as a function of
Teﬀ. For further explanation and discussion, see Sect. 5.1.3.

Appendix B: Comparison with WM-basic: Ionization

fractions and UV line-proﬁles

In Figs. B.1 and B.2 we compare the ionization fractions of
speciﬁc ions, as calculated by FASTWIND and WM-basic,
for dwarf and supergiant models, respectively. Fig. B.3 com-
pares corresponding strategic UV-line proﬁles for N iv 1720,
N v 1238,1242, O v 1371, O vi 1031,1037, and P v 1117,1128.
Further explanation and discussion is provided in Sect. 5.1.4.

FASTWIND (black), for models S30 (top), D40, S40, D50, and S50 (bottom). All proﬁles have been calculated with a radially increasing microturbulence, with maximum value
, and have been convolved with a typical rotation velocity, v sin i = 100 km s−1. The absorption feature between the two P v components is due to Si iv 1122.

Appendix C: Averaged mass absorption

coefﬁcients - clumped winds and dependence
on averaging interval

Fig. C.1 displays the density-weighted mean (Eq. 11) of the mass
absorption coeﬃcient as a function of wavelength, for dwarf
(left) and supergiant (right) models. The ﬁgure has a similar lay-
out as Figs. 21 and 22, but has been calculated for clumped mod-
els ( fcl = 20), and mass-loss rates reduced by a factor of √20.
Fig. C.2 is also analogous to Figs. 21 and 22, but now the ab-
sorption coeﬃcient has been averaged over the interval between
10 and 110 R

. For details and discussion, see Sect. 5.4.
