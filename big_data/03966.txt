The detection of galactic supernova (SN) neutrinos represents one of the future frontiers of low-
energy neutrino physics and astrophysics. The neutron coherence of neutral currents (NC) allows
quite large cross sections in the case of neutron rich targets, which can be exploited in detecting earth
and sky neutrinos by measuring nuclear recoils. They are relatively cheap and easy to maintain.
These (NC) cross sections are not dependent on ﬂavor conversions and, thus, their measurement will
provide useful information about the neutrino source. In particular they will yield information about
the primary neutrino ﬂuxes and perhaps about the spectrum after ﬂavor conversions in neutrino
sphere.They might also provide some clues about the neutrino mass hierarchy. The advantages
of large gaseous low threshold and high resolution time projection counters (TPC) detectors TPC
detectors are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The detection of galactic supernova (SN) neutrinos represents one of the future frontiers of low-energy neutrino
physics and astrophysics. In this paper we are going to discuss the relevant physics for the design and construction of
a gaseous spherical TPC for dedicated supernova detection, exploiting the coherent neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering
due to the neutral current interaction. This detector can draw on the progress made in recent years in connection
with measuring nuclear recoils in dark matter searches. It has low threshold and high resolution, it is relatively cheap
and easy to maintain. Before doing this, however, we will brieﬂy discuss the essential physics of neutrinos emitted in
supernova explosions [1] (for a review, see, e.g. the recent report [2])

II. THE SUPERNOVA NEUTRINO FLUX.

We will assume that the neutrino spectrum can be described be a Fermi Dirac Distribution with a given temperature

T and a chemical potential µ = aT . The constants T and a will be treated as free parameters. Thus

fsp(Eν , T, a) = N

1

1 + exp (Eν /T − a)

(1)

where N is a normalization constant. The temperature T is taken to be 3.5, 5 and 8 MeV for electron neutrinos (νe),
electron antineutrinos (˜νe) and all other ﬂavors (νx) respectively. The parameter a will be taken to be 0 ≤ a ≤ 5.
The average neutrino energies obtained from this distribution are shown in Table I.

The number of emitted neutrinos [1] can be obtained from the total emitted energy Uν = 3 × 1053 erg

The obtained results are shown in Table II The (time averaged) neutrino ﬂux Φν = Nν/(4πD2) at a distance D = 10
kpc=3.1 × 1022cm is given in Table III.

III. MODIFICATION OF THE SRN SPECTRA DUE TO NEUTRINO OSCILLATION OSCILLATION

Even though the neutral current detector is neutrino ﬂavor bound, the neutrino oscillations modify the SRN
spectrum. This modiﬁcation will aﬀect the expected rates since the diﬀerent ﬂavors have diﬀerent temperature and

The parameter Pm depends not only on the mixing angles but also on the crossing probabilities PH and PL for the
neutrino eigenstates at higher and lower resonances. It is also diﬀerent for neutrinos and antineutrinos, but we will
not elaborate further.

IV. THE TPC DETECTOR

4

It will be very interesting to see whether one can gain detailed information about the supernova neutrino spec-
trum(SN) and perhaps gain information about the neutrino hierarchy from a neutral current detector with high
sensitivity.

To this end we are proposing to use a gaseous spherical TPC detector dedicated for SN neutrino detection through
the neutrino-nucleus coherent process. More speciﬁcally to use a gaseous spherical TPC detector, dedicated to
supernova neutrino detection, exploiting the neutrino-nucleus neutron coherent process. The ﬁrst idea is to employ a
a small size spherical TPC detector ﬁlled with a high pressure noble gas [8] [9]. Today the spherical detector is used
for dark matter search at LSM (.6 m in diameter 10 bar pressure) underground laboratory and for NEWS experiment
a future project at SNOLAB (1.5 m, 10 bar)[10]. Dark matter detector is focused in light-WIMP search using gas
target of light elements as H, He and Ne are more sensitive in in the GeV and sub-GeV range, compared to current
experiments using of Xe and Ge. During data taking the threshold was set at 30 eV, a second hint to reach low WIMP
mass sensitivity.

For the SN project we could use a conceptual design of detector based on the existing technology and increase
detector diameter and pressure to 50 bar taking into account recent developments. A key issue for such high-pressure
operation is the use of a sensor ball smaller than the current 6.3 mm in diameter. In recent laboratory investigations
we have successfully used 2 mm ball sensor. This is coming closer to our goal of 1 mm ball, which would be the
ideal size for reaching stable operation at 50 bar. Using such small sensors will require lower operation voltage and
therefore induce low electric ﬁeld (E) at large distances:

E(r1) = r2

V0
r2
1

which shows that the electric ﬁeld at the periphery is proportional to the radius of the small ball (r2) and inversely
proportional to the radius square of the external sphere (r1). Such low ﬁeld may become a concern for large detector.
Clearly there is a contradiction between large detector and small sensor.

Recently we have successfully tested, however, a new idea with a multi-ball sensor which is supposed to solve this
problem: The multi-ball system is employing many small conductive balls arranged around a larger spherical surface,
that could also tune the electric ﬁeld at large distance and at the same time could produce a segmentation of the
detector. In the multi-ball arrangement the electric ﬁeld at large distance is proportional to the distance of the balls
from the center of the spherical detector and not to the radius of the balls as it is in the case of existing central single
ball detector. Notice that such multi-ball system will optimize the electric ﬁeld for any size of the external sphere and
the detector segmentation will help to avoid pile-up events.

An enhancement of the neutral current component is achieved via the coherent eﬀect of all neutrons in the target.
Thus employing, e.g., Xe at 10 Atm, with a feasible threshold energy of about 100 eV in the recoiling nuclei, we show
that one may expect, depending on the neutrino hierarchy, between 300 and 500 events for a sphere of radius 3m.
This can go up to 1500 and 2500 events, if the pressure is raised at 50 Atm, something quite feasible to-day taking
into account recent detector progress.

V. THE DIFFERENTIAL AND TOTAL CROSS SECTION

The diﬀerential cross section for a given neutrino energy Eν can be cast in the form[11]:

Using Eq. 13 and the above total cross sections, after summing over all neutrino species (i.e. over all T), we
obtain the number of events shown in Table V. It is a surprise for us that the total rate increases somewhat after the

the charged current current process, so long as they are sensitive only to the νe and ¯νe components.

In the presence of a detector threshold of even 1 keV the above rates are reduced by about 20% (50%) in the absence

go up to 1500 and 2500 events if the pressure is raised at 50 Atm, something quite feasible even to-day. Employing
40Ar one expects between 150 and 200 events but it can become larger if the pressure can be increased above 50 Atm,
something quite realistic.

The second idea is to build several such low cost and robust detectors and install them in several places over
the world, utilizing the small radius spheres ﬁlled with Ar under relatively small pressure. The small low pressure
sphees First estimates show that the required background level is modest and therefore there is no need for a deep
underground laboratory. A mere 100 meter water equivalent coverage seems to be suﬃcient to reduce the cosmic
muon ﬂux at the required level (in the case of many such detectors in coincidence, a modest shield is suﬃcient). The
maintenance of such systems, quite simple and needed only once every few years, could be easily assured by universities

or even by secondary schools, with only speciﬁc running programs. Admittedly such a detector scheme, measuring
low energy nuclear recoils from neutrino nucleus elastic scattering, will not be able to determine the incident neutrino
vector and, therefore, it is not possible to localize the supernova this way. This can be achieved by a cluster of such
detectors in coincidence by a triangulation technique.
A network of such detectors in coincidence with a sub-keV threshold could also be used to observe unexpected low
energy events. This low energy range has never been explored using massive detectors. A challenge of great importance
will be the synchronization of such a detector cluster with the astronomical γ-ray burst telescopes to establish whether
low energy recoils are emitted in coincidence with the mysterious γ bursts.
In summary: networks of such dedicated gaseous TPC detectors, made out of simple, robust and cheap technology,
can be simply managed by an international scientiﬁc consortium and operated by students. This network comprises
a system, which can be cheaply maintained for several decades (or even centuries). Obviously this is is a key point
towards preparing to observe few galactic supernova explosions.

Thus with adequate funding and if we are lucky to soon have a supernova not much further than 10 kps, we might
be able to observe supernova neutrinos. This event, in conjunction with organizing an activity to honor Gerry, will be
a tribute to to G. E. Brown for the memorable work he did on the equation of state of collapsing stars, in collaboration
with another giant of physics, H. Bethe. Among other things they contributed to the understanding of the birth of
our supernova neutrinos.
