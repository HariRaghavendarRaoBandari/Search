Abstract

Bombardment of a solid surface with a broad, obliquely-incident ion beam frequently produces

nanoscale surface ripples. The primary obstacle that prevents the adoption of ion bombardment as

a nano-fabrication tool is the high density of defects in the patterns that are typically formed. Our

simulations indicate that ion bombardment can produce nearly defect free ripples on the surface of

an elemental solid if the sample is concurrently and periodically rocked about an axis orthogonal to

the surface normal and the incident beam direction. We also investigate the conditions necessary

for rocking to produce highly ordered ripples and discuss how the results of our simulations can be

reproduced experimentally.

Introduction The nanoscale patterns formed by bombardment of a solid surface with
a broad beam of noble gas ions have been a subject of interest for decades [1]. Ion bombard-
ment has the potential to be an extremely useful and economical way of producing patterns
which have a characteristic length of tens of nanometers and which are well ordered over
much longer distance [1]. A longstanding issue in this ﬁeld, however, is the high density
of defects in the patterns that typically form. This problem is the primary obstacle that
prevents widespread use of ion bombardment as a nanofabrication tool, and much work
has been done toward the goal of producing very well ordered patterns [2–9]. To date, no
experiment has yielded highly ordered patterns on an elemental sample using a noble gas
ion beam.

In this rapid communication, we present the results of numerical simulations of an el-
emental surface that is bombarded by a broad beam of noble gas ions with a polar angle
of incidence that varies periodically in time. In an experiment, this could be achieved by
rocking the sample about an axis orthogonal to the surface normal and the incident ion
beam. We take the equation of motion in the absence of rocking to be the usual anisotropic
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (AKS) equation [1, 10, 11]. Several of the coeﬃcients in this equa-
tion depend on the angle of incidence, and so periodic sample rocking has the eﬀect of
making these coeﬃcients periodic in time. We show that a remarkable and unforeseen de-
gree of order emerges for a broad range of parameters in both one-dimensional (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) simulations. Thus, periodic temporal driving can lead to near perfect
spatial periodicity.

1D Results The equation of motion for the unrocked solid surface is the much-studied

AKS equation, [12–15]

0ux − Auxx + A(cid:48)uyy − B∇4u +(cid:0)λu2

ut = v(cid:48)

(cid:1) /2,

x + λ(cid:48)u2

y

where u is the deviation of the surface height from its unperturbed steady-state value; x and
y are the horizontal coordinates parallel and perpendicular to the projection of the ion beam
direction onto the surface, respectively; t is the time; and the subscripts x, y, and t denote
partial derivatives. All of the constant coeﬃcients A, A(cid:48), λ, λ(cid:48) and B will be taken to be
positive save for λ. The AKS equation has long been used as a model for the time evolution
of an ion bombarded surface [10, 11]. and expressions that relate the coeﬃcients to the
underlying physical parameters have been given [11, 16, 17] . The term proportional to the

constant v(cid:48)
and so will be dropped for the remainder of this paper.

0 in Eq. (1) may be eliminated by transforming to a moving frame of reference,

In this section, we specialize to the case in which h is independent of y. This reduces

Eq. (1) to the 1+1 dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation,

ut = −Auxx − Buxxxx + λu2

x/2.

(2)

For the case of time-independent coeﬃcients, the KS equation can be rescaled to a completely
parameter-free form by setting

u = (A/λ) ˜u,

t = (B/A2) ˜t,

(3)

and x =(cid:112)B/A ˜x,

where ˜u, ˜t, and ˜x are the dimensionless surface height, time, and lateral coordinate, respec-
tively.

To investigate the eﬀects of periodic rocking on the pattern formation, we focus on the
special case in which the sample is bombarded for a time t = π/ω at an angle of incidence θ1,
then for an equal time at an angle of incidence θ2, and so forth. Without loss of generality,
we may express the values of A and λ at these angles as

λ(θ1) = λ0 (1 + r1),
λ(θ2) = λ0 (1 − r1),

A(θ1) = A0 (1 + r2),

and A(θ2) = A0,

(4)

(5)

where r1 > 0 and r2 are dimensionless parameters and λ0 and A0 are constants. While A(θ)
and λ(θ) are not simple functions of the angle of incidence θ, because we are switching the
angle of incidence discretely, we only need the values of A and λ at two angles.

Because neither λ(θ) nor A(θ) is a monotone function [11] of θ, it is possible to choose
values of θ for which A(θ1) = A(θ2) and λ(θ1) (cid:54)= λ(θ2). Thus, by a suitable experimental
setup, a periodic, discrete variation in λ can be achieved while minimizing or eliminating
any variation in A. As shown below, oscillations in A can be detrimental to the formation
of highly ordered patterns, and should be minimized when possible. We will not consider
the eﬀect of periodic variation in B, since its dependence on the angle of incidence is weak
[1].

Using exponential time diﬀerencing [18, 19], we have performed numerical integrations
of Eq. (2) with λ and A periodically and discretely switching between the values given by
Eqs. (4) and (5). We employed the rescaling given by Eq. (3) with A and λ replaced by A0 and

3

λ0, respectively. The initial condition was low amplitude spatial white noise. The results are
nothing short of astonishing. Figures 1 and 2 show the results of two simulations, one with
rocking and one without, in real space and Fourier space. While the KS equation without
rocking yields a surface which has a high degree of disorder, albeit with a characteristic
length scale, the rocked KS equation with dimensionless frequency ˜ω ≡ ωB/A2
0 = 0.15π
produces ripples that are almost perfectly periodic. Figure 3 shows spacetime plots of time
sequences taken from the same simulations. These demonstrate that without rocking the
system exhibits the spatio-temporal chaos characteristic of the KS equation [12, 13]. On the
other hand, following a brief transient state, the rocked sample displays an extremely high
degree of order which persists over time. Larger domain sizes L, ﬁner spatial and temporal
discretizations, and much longer simulation times have been investigated numerically, and
give comparable results to those shown in Figs. 1-3.

and ˜t = 103.

0 = 0.15π, domain length L = 100,

The oscillations in ripple amplitude evident in Fig. 3(a) may be explained by a scaling
argument. As discussed above, if A and λ are time-independent constants, then Eq. (2) may
be written in a parameter-free form via the rescaling given by Eq. (3). This shows that the
characteristic ripple amplitude is proportional to |A/λ|. For the case in which the sample
is rocked and r2 = 0, we therefore expect that after a sudden change in the value of λ, the
amplitude of the ripple pattern will evolve toward the amplitude associated with the new
value of λ. When |λ| decreases the ripples grow larger in amplitude, and when |λ| increases
the amplitude attenuates.

An intuitive understanding of the order produced by rocking may be gained by a heuristic
argument. Consider what happens to the surface when |λ| changes from a large value to a
x in
small value at a time t1. In the moments before the switch, the term proportional to λu2
the rocked KS equation is on average comparable to the linear terms −Auxx−Buxxxx since in
the steady-state limit, the ripple growth rate averages to zero. Immediately after the switch,
therefore, the term λu2
x will typically be small compared to the linear terms. Consequently,
we expect the Fourier transform of the surface height ˜U (k, t) to grow approximately as

˜U (k, t) (cid:39) ˜U (k, t1) exp(cid:0)(Ak2 − Bk4) (t − t1)(cid:1) ,

(6)
where k is the wave number. Thus, periodically reducing the value of |λ| allows the surface
to periodically grow roughly as it would in the linear approximation. Ripples described by
Eq. (6) become increasingly well ordered because the peak in the Fourier spectrum becomes
higher and narrower as time passes. Conversely, when the value of |λ| is increased, the
amplitude gained during the stage of approximately linear growth attenuates according to
the scaling argument given above. This ensures that the ripple amplitude does not become
so large that higher order nonlinear eﬀects would have to be taken into account. This
explanation suggests that good order will not obtained if λ oscillates about an average value
of zero, since then there is no opportunity for nearly linear growth to take place.

The excitation of Fourier modes which are multiples of the selected wave number seen in
Fig. 1 arises as a consequence of the coupling between modes induced by the nonlinear term
x. A large amplitude mode with wavenumber k will directly excite the mode of wavenum-
λu2
ber 2k. The coupling between these two modes will then excite the mode of wavenumber

3k, and so on.

To characterize the quality of the order produced by the rocking procedure, we ﬁt the
peak surrounding the highest amplitude wavenumber in the Fourier spectrum to a Gaussian
and record its width. In order to avoid sampling at the same point in each rocking cycle, the
ﬁts were performed at hundreds of randomly selected times throughout a given simulation
and then averaged.

Figure 4 shows the width of the highest peak in the Fourier spectrum as a function of
the rocking frequency for two values of r1. It is clear that the eﬀect of rocking is strongly
dependent on the frequency with which the sample is rocked. However, within a broad range
of frequencies, the surface becomes highly ordered for r1 = 4, making this procedure feasible
to implement experimentally. One important conclusion drawn from our simulations is that,
just as our heuristic argument suggested, it is essential that r1 > 1 (so that λ changes sign
periodically) for good order to form. This is also illustrated by Fig. 4, since good order

6

is not obtained for r1 = 0.5. Increasing r1 further than r1 = 4 has the eﬀect of slightly
narrowing the band of frequencies which produce good order and reducing the amplitude of
the resulting ripples. Nevertheless, for 1.5 (cid:46) r1 (cid:46) 15, scaled frequencies ˜f ≡ ˜ω/2π between
0.06 and 0.08 produce exceptionally good order.

FIG. 4: (Color online) Fourier peak width as a function of the scaled rocking frequency
˜f ≡ ˜ω/(2π) for two values of r1 and with r2 = 0. Each point represents a single simulation,
and the average for each value of the frequency is shown. Note that for r1 = 0.5, λ always
has the same sign, while for r1 = 4, it changes sign.

An important physical consideration is the eﬀect that a periodic variation of the coeﬃcient
A in Eq. (2) has on the order obtained by rocking. Since this coeﬃcient depends on the
angle of incidence, it is likely to vary in general unless θ1 and θ2 are carefully selected. For
λ and A given by Eqs. (4) and (5), the characteristic width of the highest Fourier peak for
r1 = 4 and a range of r2 values is shown in Fig. 5. For small positive values of r2, the surface
still becomes well ordered, but larger positive values of r2 do not result in a well ordered
surface. If r2 < 0, on the other hand, the high degree of order develops even for relatively
large values of |r2|. Thus, the variation in A due to the rocking procedure is not expected
to be a signiﬁcant impediment to producing virtually defect free ripples by sample rocking.
If the order seen in our simulations is to be achieved experimentally, it is crucial that the
rocking frequency be chosen within the frequency range discussed above. Fortunately, ﬁnding
the correct rocking frequency only requires that the linear growth rate be determined for
one of the two angles of incidence. The dimensional and nondimensional rocking frequencies
are related by f = 4σ ˜f, where σ is the linear growth rate of the fastest growing mode for

that angle of incidence. Experimentally, σ may be approximated by the rate at which the
surface roughens at early times, since this roughening will be dominated by the most linearly
unstable mode. Simulations indicate that the growth rate during the period where |λ| is a
minimum determines the optimal rocking frequency. Therefore, if r1 is greater (less) than
zero, then σ should be evaluated at θ2 (θ1).

As we have seen, for the rocking procedure to be eﬀective, λ must change sign. There is
strong theoretical and experimental evidence that λ passes through zero at a critical angle
θc for unrocked samples [11, 20]. Typically, 60◦ < θc < 80◦. Given that the amplitude of
the surface roughness scales as |λ|−1, we expect that λ will vanish at the angle of incidence
which maximizes the surface roughness. Note that while solutions to the KS equation grow
without limit for a spatial white noise initial condition when λ = 0, the amplitude remains
ﬁnite in an experiment because a ﬁnite ion ﬂuence is used.

2D Results Given the degree of order that can form on a rocked surface in 1D, it is
natural to ask whether a 2D rocked surface will produce similar results. Physically, this
means we are no longer requiring that h be independent of y. We return to Eq. (1), keeping
v(cid:48)
0 = 0. With temporally periodic coeﬃcients, Eq. (1) is the rocked AKS equation. Panels
(a)-(c) of Fig. 6 show the surface for a particular set of parameters for which λ oscillates
between the values 10 and −6. As in 1D, the unrocked equation of motion displays spatio-
temporal chaos with a characteristic length scale (see Fig. 6 (d)). The rocked AKS equation,
on the other hand, initially forms a transient state which contains numerous defects. The

8

rocking procedure causes these defects to move together and annihilate. Eventually, even
long wavelength Fourier modes are suppressed. The full video from which these snapshots
are taken is available in the link in Fig. (6) (Multimedia View).

The rocked AKS equation has more parameters than the rocked KS equation, and the
computational time required for a complete investigation of the parameter space of the
rocked AKS equation would be prohibitively long. However, variation in the coeﬃcient λ(cid:48) is
likely unavoidable during rocking, since this coeﬃcient also depends on the angle of incidence
θ. We therefore considered the eﬀect of simultaneously varying λ(cid:48) and λ. The results of a
simulation for which λ(cid:48) = 2+0.2 sign(sin(ωt)) (not shown) revealed that periodic oscillations
of λ(cid:48) with this amplitude do not have a detrimental eﬀect on the resultant order for A, A(cid:48),
B, and λ equal to their values in the ﬁrst three frames of Fig. 6.

in (a) - (c) but with λ = 2 so that there is no rocking. The time is ˜t = 1840.

Discussion The consequences of a time-periodic coeﬃcient in the KS equation have been
considered in the context of annular ﬂuid ﬂow [21]. Due to computational limitations at the
time of that work, the phenomenon reported here was not discovered. In the ﬁrst theoretical
study of a periodically rocked, ion bombarded surface [22], several important physical con-
tributions to the dynamics were neglected, including curvature dependent sputtering [16]. In
a later theoretical treatment of ion bombardment with sample rocking [23], nonlinear terms
were omitted from the equation of motion and consequently no increase in order was found.

Experiments have not yet been performed in which a sample was bombarded while being
periodically rocked. Our results give a compelling motivation for conducting experiments
of that kind. By contrast, azimuthal sample rotation during ion bombardment has stud-
ied intensively, and gives a means of producing ultra-smooth surfaces [24–27], generating
hexagonal order [28], and controlling ripple patterns [29].

The case in which A and λ vary sinusoidally in time has been explored numerically, and
was found to produce order comparable to discrete switching. More complicated time de-
pendencies are beyond the scope of this letter, but are not expected to produce substantially
diﬀerent results.

Conclusion Our simulations demonstrate that if a sample is bombarded with a broad
noble gas ion beam while simultaneously being rocked, nearly perfect nanoscale ripples can
result. Unlike other methods [8, 9], ours can be used to produce highly ordered surface
ripples on an elemental material and does not require the implantation of an undesirable
second atomic species or a high sample temperature. We also discussed how optimal values
of the rocking frequency and the angles of incidence may be determined in an experiment.
