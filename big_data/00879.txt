We present the ﬁrst calculation of the one-loop corrections to the triple Higgs coupling in the
framework of a simpliﬁed 3+1 Dirac neutrino model, that is three light neutrinos plus one heavy
neutrino embedded in the Standard Model (SM). The triple Higgs coupling is a key parameter
of the scalar potential triggering the electroweak symmetry-breaking mechanism in the SM. The
impact of the heavy neutrino can be as large as +20% to +30% for parameter points allowed by
the current experimental constraints depending on the tightness of the perturbative bound. This
can be probed at the high-luminosity LHC and at the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron
mode, an envisioned 100 TeV pp machine. The eﬀects that we have calculated are expected to be
enhanced if more heavy neutrinos are included, as in low-scale seesaw mechanisms.

Introduction.—The biggest highlight of the 7-8 TeV
run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is
the discovery in 2012 of a Higgs boson with a mass of
around 125 GeV [1, 2]. The Higgs boson is the remnant
of the electroweak symmetry-breaking (EWSB) mecha-
nism [3–6] that gives their masses to the other funda-
mental particles and unitarizes the scattering of weak
bosons [7, 8]. Since its discovery, the properties (cou-
plings to other fermions and bosons, CP quantum num-
bers) of the new particle have been measured and the
data agree well with Standard Model expectations [9, 10],
but a more exotic interpretation is still possible. In or-
der to ultimately test the electroweak sector of the SM,
the measure of the triple Higgs coupling is necessary and
would allow for the reconstruction of the scalar potential.
It is one of the main goals of the high-luminosity run of
the LHC (HL-LHC), for reviews see e.g. refs. [11, 12].

The only signal of new physics so far that absolutely
calls for a particle physics explanation is the observa-
tion of neutrino oscillations which imply that neutrinos
are massive [13]. Since their discovery, all the oscillation
parameters have been measured except for the neutrino
mass ordering and a CP violating phase δCP [14–16]. To
explain the non-zero neutrino masses requires extending
the SM; one of the simplest possibility is to add fermionic
gauge singlets that will play the role of right-handed neu-
trinos. The addition of these heavy sterile neutrinos is
quite generic, appearing in the type I seesaw [17–20] and
its variants [21–27] for example. Here we will consider
a simpliﬁed 3+1 model where the SM is phenomenolog-
ically modiﬁed to account for 3 light massive neutrinos
and one heavy sterile neutrino, all of them being Dirac
fermions. This will capture the beyond-the-SM (BSM)
eﬀects we want to analyze.

In this article we study the impact of this extended
neutrino sector on the Higgs sector and in particular on
the triple Higgs coupling. We calculate for the ﬁrst time

the full one-loop corrections to the triple Higgs coupling
in a simpliﬁed 3+1 model with three light Dirac neu-
trinos, identiﬁed with those of the SM, plus one heavy
Dirac neutrino. We describe the analytical setup of our
calculation, the model as well as the theoretical and ex-
perimental constraints considered before presenting the
numerical results. For parameter points that are allowed
by the constraints we ﬁnd eﬀects that can be probed
at the HL-LHC and at the Future Circular Collider in
hadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh), a potential 100 TeV pp
collider following the LHC. Larger deviations are ex-
pected if more heavy neutrinos are included, as in the
case of low-scale seesaw mechanisms.

Simpliﬁed 3 + 1 model and constraints.—In order to
illustrate the eﬀect of a heavy neutrino on the triple Higgs
coupling we introduce a simpliﬁed model that includes 3
light neutrinos and an extra heavy neutrino. All of them
are Dirac fermions and the heavy neutrino couples to the
SM particles through its mixing with SM ﬁelds. This
reproduces the behavior of sterile neutrinos present in
seesaw extensions of the SM for example [21–25]. In the
mass basis, the relevant couplings between neutrinos and
SM bosons are given by

where UP M N S [30, 31] corresponds to the best-ﬁt point
for a normal hierarchy in [16] with δCP = 0. We have
also chosen the 3 light neutrinos to be degenerate with
mn1/n2/n3 = 1 eV in agreement with the results of the
Mainz and Troitsk experiments [32, 33]. Since their small
masses translate into small couplings to the Higgs boson,
we expect the corrections to the triple Higgs coupling
from the light neutrinos to be irrelevant. As a conse-
quence, we have not varied the light neutrino parameters
in this work.

Other experimental and theoretical constraints that
apply to the heavy sterile neutrino have to be taken into
account as well. Direct searches at the LHC are not as
constraining [34] as indirect constraints yet and should be
even less constraining than claimed in ref. [34] since the
production cross sections were overestimated according
to ref. [35]. Global ﬁts to various observables have been
performed recently [36–38], pointing to electroweak pre-
cision observables as the most constraining ones above
the Higgs mass. We use here the constraints from the
global ﬁt performed in [39, 40],

Be4 ≤ 0.041 ,
Bµ4 ≤ 0.030 ,
Bτ 4 ≤ 0.087 ,

(14)

at the 95% C.L. From the theoretical point of view, we
require the loop expansion to remain perturbative, ap-
plying either a loose (tight) bound of

(cid:18) max|Ci4| g2 mn4

(cid:19)3

< 16π (2π) .

(15)

(9)

The tight bound is roughly equivalent to the bound that
comes from a 2-loop analysis of the perturbativity of

the SM presented in [41, 42]. Using the largest Ci4 in
agreement with eq. (14), these translate into upper lim-
its on the heavy neutrino mass of mn4 = 14.3 TeV and
mn4 = 7.2 TeV, respectively. However, the decay width
of the heavy neutrino grows as m3
In order for the
n4
quantum state to be a deﬁnite particle, we also require
Γn4 ≤ 0.6 mn4 , which limits the upper value of mn4 to
approximately 9 TeV for Bτ 4 = 0.087. These limits de-
pend on the values chosen for the Bi4 and a decreased
mixing increases the upper limit on mn4 .

We have chosen to study the eﬀects of the heavy neu-
trino by ﬁrst looking at the distribution of the one-loop
corrected triple Higgs coupling as a function of the mo-
mentum qH∗ in the splitting H(qH∗ ) → HH where one
Higgs boson is oﬀ-shell. We have varied mn4 while keep-
ing Bτ 4 = 0.087 ﬁxed at its maximum allowed value by
the experimental constraints as stated in eq. (14). The
other neutrino mixing terms are zero. The result is dis-
played in ﬁg. 1.

The full one-loop correction is displayed as a function
of qH∗ and the genuine BSM eﬀects are depicted in the
insert as ratio over the SM one-loop result. The choice
mn4 = 2.7 GeV corresponds to the case where the heavy
neutrino eﬀective coupling to the Higgs boson is equal to
the top-quark Yukawa coupling. As can be seen, the de-
viation at low momentum is already sizable. The largest
positive one-loop corrections in the SM are at qH∗ (cid:39) 500
GeV, where the BSM contribution tends to decrease them
to −3% at mn4 = 7 TeV and −9% at mn4 = 9 TeV.
The most interesting eﬀects come at larger momentum
where the deviation from the SM increases with larger
mn4, reaching +22% at qH∗ = 2500 GeV for mn4 = 7
TeV (our maximum allowed value for mn4 by the tight

Given the projected sensitivity of around 50% per ex-
periment on the measure of λHHH at the HL-LHC [46]
which translates into a sensitivity of 35% when statisti-
cally combining ATLAS and CMS, the eﬀect of the heavy
neutrino may already be probed at the HL-LC in the case
of the maximal value of mn4 = 9 TeV using the loose

qH∗ = 2500 GeV (right). The other heavy neutrino mixing parameters are set to zero. The light grey area is excluded by the

perturbativity bound. When going to the FCC-hh the
eﬀects become important enough to be clearly visible, as
the projected statistical precision on λHHH at the FCC-
hh with 3 ab−1 is expected to be 8% per experiment using
only the b¯bγγ [47]. Combining the two experiments and
using the other search channels it is reasonable to expect
a ∼ 5% sensitivity. The +22% increase predicted at high
q∗
H with a conservative perturbativity limit is four times
the projected sensitivity. Clearly measuring the neutrino
eﬀect or constraining neutrino models in a region hard
to probe otherwise may be possible.

To get an idea of the dependence of the heavy neu-
trino eﬀect on the model parameters, we have scanned
the parameter space (mn4,|Bτ 4|2) while ﬁxing the re-
maining parameters Be4 = Bµ4 = 0. ∆BSM is the per-
centage correction of the neutrino eﬀects over the one-
loop SM triple Higgs coupling deﬁned in eq. (7). The
oﬀ-shell Higgs momentum has been ﬁxed to the most
interesting values identiﬁed in ﬁg. 1, qH∗ = 500/2500
GeV. The BSM contribution ∆BSM is displayed in ﬁg. 2
where the experimental and theoretical bounds are also
included as grey areas. When the heavy neutrino mass
and mixing are small, its contribution vanishes as ex-
pected. As seen in eq. (17), the BSM correction ex-
hibits a strong dependence on the heavy neutrino mass,
as terms of order O(m4
) arise and they
increase |∆BSM| gradually to reach the maximum al-
lowed deviations ∆BSM (cid:39) −10% at qH∗ = 500 GeV and
∆BSM (cid:39) +30% at qH∗ = 2500 GeV. It shall be men-
tioned that very similar contour maps are found when
one trades Bτ 4 against either Be4 or Bµ4.

Summary and outlook.—In this article we have inves-
tigated the one-loop eﬀects of a heavy neutrino on the
triple Higgs coupling in a simpliﬁed model that accounts

for the light neutrino masses and mixing and contains one
extra heavy neutrino. After taking into account the ex-
perimental contraints we have found that the maximum
eﬀect can be as large as a 30% increase over the SM
one–loop eﬀects. The eﬀect is of the order of the pro-
jected experimental accuracy on the measure of λHHH
at the HL-LHC, and if a tighter perturbative bound is
used on the 3+1 model it is still possible to have a +20%
deviation that is four times the projected experimental
accuracy at the FCC-hh with 3 ab−1, thus clearly vis-
ible. This is the ﬁrst time the eﬀects of an extended
neutrino sector on the triple Higgs coupling have been
investigated. It should be noted that the calculation can
be extended to cases with more heavy neutrinos where
the eﬀects can be enhanced. This is conﬁrmed by our
preliminary study in the inverse seesaw [48].
