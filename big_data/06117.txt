We study the event-by-event generation of ﬂow vorticity in RHIC Au + Au collisions and
LHC Pb + Pb collisions by using the HIJING model. Different deﬁnitions of the vorticity
ﬁeld and velocity ﬁeld are considered. A variety of properties of the vorticity are explored,
including the impact parameter dependence, the collision energy dependence, the spatial
distribution, the event-by-event ﬂuctuation of the magnitude and azimuthal direction, and
the time evolution. In addition, the spatial distribution of the ﬂow helicity is also studied.

INTRODUCTION

In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, two atomic nuclei collide at relativistic energies such that
the energy deposited in the reaction region can be large enough to produce the deconﬁned quark-
gluon matter — usually called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In addition, recent studies revealed
that the heavy-ion collisions generate also extremely strong electromagnetic ﬁelds. The numerical
simulations found that the magnetic ﬁelds generated in Au + Au collisions at the top RHIC energy,
√s = 200 GeV, can reach eB ∼ several m2
π (where e is the absolute value of the electron charge
and mπ is the pion mass) and in the Pb + Pb collisions at the LHC energy, √s = 2.76 TeV, can
π [1–5]. The generated electric ﬁelds, due to the event-by-event ﬂuc-
reach eB ∼ several tens of m2
tuation of charge distribution of nucleus or due to the asymmetric collision geometry (e.g., the Cu
+ Au collisions), can be of the same order of magnitude as the magnetic ﬁelds [3, 4, 6–8]. When
coupled to the P and/or C odd domains in the QGP, these strong electromagnetic ﬁelds can induce
remarkable anomalous transport phenomena, including chiral magnetic effect (CME) [9, 10], chi-
ral separation effect (CSE) [11, 12], chiral magnetic wave (CMW) [13, 14], chiral electric separa-
tion effect (CESE) [15–18], etc. Recently, the measurements performed by STAR Collaboration
at RHIC [19–23] and by ALICE Collaboration at LHC [24, 25] showed features consistent with
the expectation of CME and CMW although the experimental observables receive signiﬁcant con-
tributions from background effects which are still not successfully subtracted; see Refs. [26–29]
for reviews.

The existence of strong magnetic ﬁelds suggests that there may be fast rotation and/or large ﬂow
vorticity in the produced quark-gluon matter in heavy-ion collisions. In fact, in classical physics,
the Larmor’s theorem states that the motion of a charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld B is equivalent

2

to the motion in a rotating frame with angular velocity Ω = −qB/(2m) (plus an additional
centrifugal force) where m and q are the mass and charge of the particle. On the other hand, it
is also very natural to expect the appearance of ﬂow vorticity in heavy-ion collisions. Consider a
non-central heavy-ion collision with impact parameter b. The initial angular momentum J0 of the
two nuclei with respect to the collision center is roughly given by Ab√s/2 with A the number of
nucleons in one nucleus. We can easily estimate the magnitude of J0. For example, for Au + Au
collisions at √s = 200 GeV at b = 10 fm, J0 ∼ 106; and for Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76
TeV with b = 10 fm, J0 ∼ 107. After the collision, a fraction of the initial angular momentum is
retained in the interaction region. This fraction of initial angular momentum manifests itself as a
shear of the longitudinal momentum density or velocity ﬁeld. As a consequence of this shear ﬂow,
nonzero local vorticity arises which should be roughly perpendicular to the reaction plane.

Such voticity provides us the possibility to monitor the nontrivial topological sector of quan-
tum chromodynamics (QCD) via the so-called chiral vortical effect (CVE) which is the vortical
analogue of CME and CSE and represents the generation of vector and axial currents along the
vorticity [30–32]. The CVE can be neatly expressed as

j = χω,

j5 = χ5ω,

(1.1)
(1.2)

where ω is the ﬂow vorticity, j and j5 are the vector and chiral currents, respectively. The two
conductivities are χ = Ncµµ5/(2π2) and χ5 = Nc[T 2/12 + (µ2 + µ2
5)/(4π2)] with µ the baryon
chemical potential, µ5 the chiral chemical potential, and T the temperature. The coupled evolution
of the vector and axial currents and densities lead to propagating collective mode called the chiral
vortical wave (CVW) [33] which is the vortical analogue of CMW. In presence of both vorticity
and magnetic ﬁeld, even complex collective modes, like the chiral heat wave and its mixture with
CMW and CVW, can emerge [34]. Phenomenologically, the CVE can induce baryon charge sep-
aration along the vorticity direction which can be detected via speciﬁcally designed two-particle
correlation [35, 36] (see also Sec. V F). The CVW can cause ﬂavor quadrupole in QGP which
in turn can lead to elliptic ﬂow splitting effect for Λ baryons that may be experimentally mea-
sured [33]. Recently, the STAR Collaboration at RHIC has reported signals that are qualitatively
agree with the expectation of the CVE [36]. The ﬂow vorticity may also lead to other novel effects
in heavy-ion collisions; see e.g. Refs. [37–48].

There were already works that investigated the vorticity in heavy-ion collisions [39, 40, 45, 49–
55]; some of them will be discussed in the present paper. However, as far as we know, a systematic
study of the following issues within a uniﬁed framework is still lack 1: how large the vorticity can
be, how it depends on centrality in different collision systems especially in RHIC Au + Au colli-
sions and in LHC Pb + Pb collisions, how the vorticity is distributed over space and time, how the

performed detailed numerics to study the vorticity by using AMPT model. Their results have some overlap with
ours.

3

magnitude and azimuthal direction of the vorticity ﬂuctuate over events, and how its orientation
correlates to the matter geometry. These issues are very important for the understanding of various
vorticity-induced effects, e.g., the CVE and CVW in heavy-ion collisions; see the discussions in
Sec. V F. In this paper, we will study these issues in detail in a manner parallel to the previous
study of electromagnetic ﬁelds in heavy-ion collisions in Refs. [4, 7, 28, 57, 58]. We will consider
different kinds of deﬁnition for the vorticity ﬁeld and velocity ﬁeld and perform numerical sim-
ulations of the generation of vorticity on event-by-event basis by using HIJING model [59–62].
At the mean time, the event-by-event ﬂuctuating participant planes will be also calculated by us-
ing HIJING model and the azimuthal correlation between vorticity and participant plane will be
studied as well.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we will give a brief review of some theoretical
aspects of the vorticity in hydrodynamics. In Sec. III, we will set up our numerical simulation. The
numerical results will be presented in Sec. IV and Sec. V. A hydrodynamic analysis of the time
evolution of the vorticity is presented in Sec. VI. Finally, we will summarize the main ﬁndings in
Sec. VII. Throughout this paper, we use natural units  = c = kB = 1 and the metric gµν = gµν =
diag(1,−1,−1,−1).

II. REVIEW OF VORTICITY IN HYDRODYNAMICS

A. Non-relativistic case

In non-relativistic hydrodynamics, the vorticity (pseudo)vector ﬁeld is deﬁned by 2

ω(x, t) = ∇ × v,

(2.1)

where v is the ﬂow velocity. Hereafter, we will use ω1 to denote Eq. (2.1) in order to avoid
confusion with the vorticity that will be deﬁned in next subsection. The vorticity ω1 is a measure
of the local angular velocity of the ﬂuid. For ideal barotropic ﬂuid, i.e., the ﬂuid whose viscosity
is negligible and in which the pressure P is a function of the mass density ρ, i.e., P = P (ρ), the
evolution of the vorticity is governed by the following vorticity equation,

∂ω1
∂t

= ∇ × (v × ω1),

(2.2)

which has the following two remarkable consequences.

(1) The Helmholtz-Kelvin theorem (circulation conservation), which states that the closed con-
tour line integral of the velocity ﬁeld (called circulation) is conserved as the contour is transported
by the ﬂow, i.e.,

d

dt I v · dx = 0,

(2.3)

2 This deﬁnition follows the convention of classical ﬂuid mechanics, see for example, Ref. [63]. In the literature on

chiral vortical effect, a factor 1/2 is usually inserted in front of the curl to deﬁne the vorticity.

4

where d/dt is understood as the comoving time derivative. Another way to state the Helmholtz-
Kelvin theorem is that in an ideal barotropic ﬂuid the vortex lines are comoving with the ﬂuid as
if they are frozen in the ﬂuid.

(2) The helicity conservation. From the velocity and vorticity ﬁelds, one can construct a pseu-

doscalar ﬁeld,

which is called the helicity density of the ﬂow [64]. The integral of hf over the whole space,

hf (x, t) = v · ω1,

Hf = Z d3x hf = Z d3x v · ω1,

(2.4)

(2.5)

is the total helicity of the ﬂow. When the vorticity equation (2.2) holds, the total helicity Hf is
conserved [64, 65]. Moreover, as ﬁrst pointed out by Moffatt, the Hf is actually a topological
invariant of the ﬂow — it measures the degree of intertwist of the vortex lines in the ﬂuid [64, 66,
67].

To end this subsection, we note an interesting similarity between the vorticity in an ideal ﬂuid
and the magnetic ﬁeld in a perfectly conducting plasma. Let B(x, t) be the magnetic ﬁeld and
A(x, t) be the vector potential, i.e., B = ∇ × A. The equation that governs the evolution of B
in a perfectly conducting plasma reads

∂B
∂t

= ∇ × (v × B),

(2.6)

which bears immediate similarity with Eq. (2.2). In fact, from Eq. (2.6) the magnetic frozen-in
theorem [68] follows, which states that the magnetic lines are frozen in a perfectly conducting
plasma just like that the vortex lines are frozen in an ideal barotropic ﬂuid. Furthermore, by
replacing v with A and ω1 with B in Eq. (2.4) and Eq. (2.5), one can deﬁne the magnetic helicity
density

and the total magnetic helicity in the plasma

hM = A · B

HM = Z d3xhM = Z d3xA · B.

(2.7)

(2.8)

Although hM is gauge dependent, HM is a gauge invariant quantity.
It is straightforward to
show [69] that HM is a conserved quantity under the time evolution of Eq. (2.6) and it is also
a topological invariant that measures the degree of intertwist of the magnetic lines [66, 67].

B. Relativistic case

A natural extension of the deﬁnition (2.1) to relativistic ﬂuid is

ωµ = ǫµνρσuν∂ρuσ =

1
2

ǫµνρσuνωρσ,

(2.9)

5

where uµ is the 4-velocity of the ﬂuid which is normalized as uµuµ = 1 with u0 = γ = 1/√1 − v2

and u = γv, and ωµν is a rank-2 skew tensor,

ωµν = ∂µuν − ∂νuµ,

(2.10)

which we will call the kinematic vorticity tensor. Hereafter, we will denote ωµ and ωµν as ωµ
ωµν
2 , respectively. It is worth writing down the components of ωµ
2 . The spatial components are

2 and

and the time component is

ω2 = γ2ω1 + γ2v × ∂tv,

(2.11)

(2.12)

2 = γ2v · ω1 = v · ω2.
ω0
2 → (hf, ω1), as we expect.
2 and ω2µν, it seems natural to identify ω0

2 as the relativistic

Thus, in the non-relativistic limit, ωµ

In accord with the deﬁnitions of ωµ

helicity density and deﬁne the circulation along a closed contour line in spacetime as

I uµdxµ,

(2.13)

which, after using the Green’s theorem, is transformed into the hypersurface integral of ω2µν.
However, such-deﬁned circulation and the total helicity (the integral of ω0
2 over space) are in
general not conserved even for ideal barotropic ﬂuid.

In order to maintain the circulation conservation and helicity conservation, other deﬁnitions of
vorticity have been introduced [70, 71]. For example, if the ﬂuid does not carry any conserved
charge, one can deﬁne the vorticity tensor as [54, 72],

Ωµν = ∂µ(T uν) − ∂ν(T uµ),

(2.14)

where T is temperature. The corresponding circulation along a closed contour line in spacetime is
deﬁned by

I T uµdxµ.

(2.15)

By using the thermodynamic relations dε = T ds and dP = sdT , the relativistic Euler equation
for ideal ﬂuid,

(ε + P )

d
dτ

uµ = ∇µP,

(2.16)

where ε and P are the energy density and pressure, d/dτ = uµ∂µ is the proper time or comoving
time derivative, and ∇µ = ∂µ − uµ(d/dτ ), can be deduced to

d
dτ

(T uµ) = ∂µT.

(2.17)

Thus one ﬁnds that for ideal ﬂuid,

d

dτ I T uµdxµ = I ∂µT dxµ = 0.

This is the relativistic Helmholtz-Kelvin theorem.

The vorticity (pseudo)vector corresponding to Ωµν can be deﬁned as

It divergence reads

Ωµ =

1
2

ǫµνρσT uνΩρσ = T 2ωµ
2 .

∂µΩµ =

1
2

ǫµνρσΩµνΩρσ = 2ΩµΩµνuν,

which vanishes for ideal ﬂuid upon noticing that Eq. (2.17) can be rewritten as

Ωµνuν = 0.

6

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

Therefore, the integral of Ω0 over space is conserved and we can identify Ω0 as the conserved
helicity density.

If the ﬂuid carries a conserved charge (e.g., the baryon number), one can deﬁne the vorticity

tensor as [70, 71]

˜Ωµν = ∂µ(wuν) − ∂ν(wuµ),

(2.22)

where w = (ε+P )/n is the enthalpy per particle with n being the density of the conserved charge.
The circulation conservation and helicity conservation formulated by using ˜Ωµν is presented in
Appendix A. However, in the following numerical simulations, we will not consider ˜Ωµν because
the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions carries almost zero conserved
charges.

III. SETUP OF THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

In this section, we describe the general setup of our numerical simulations. The coordinate
system of the heavy-ion collisions is illustrated in Fig. 1. We choose the z axis to be along the
beam direction of the projectile, x axis to be along the impact parameter b which points from the
target to the projectile, and y axis to be perpendicular to the reaction plane. The origin of the time
axis, t = 0, is set to the time when the two colliding nuclei overlap maximally.

We will focus mainly on the mid-rapidity region, but will also discuss how the vorticity varies
with rapidity in Sec. V C. We will numerically compute the initial vorticity at proper time τ = τ0
with the value of τ0 will be given later. We will only brieﬂy discuss the time evolution in Sec. VI
based on analytical treatment of hydrodynamics. A full viscous hydrodynamic simulations is
however beyond the scope of the present paper.

A. Deﬁnition of the velocity ﬁeld

To compute the vorticity, we must ﬁrst deﬁne the velocity ﬁeld numerically. This can be
achieved by introducing a smearing function Φ(x, xi) where x is the ﬁeld point and xi is the
coordinate of the ith particle. The effect of Φ(x, xi) is to smear a physical quantity, e.g., energy or
momentum, carried by the ith particle which locates at xi to other coordinate point x. Therefore,
Φ(x, xi) somehow represents the quantum wave packet of the ith particle. With having Φ(x, xi),
we can have two natural ways to deﬁne the velocity ﬁeld for a given colliding event 3,

that is, v1 is the velocity of the particle ﬂow associated with J µ and v2 is the velocity of the energy
ﬂow (see Appendix B).

Different choice for the smearing function Φ(x, xi) gives different result for the velocity. In our
computations, we choose a smearing function whose functional form at τ = τ0 is a Gaussian [73],

where σr and ση are two width parameters and K is a scale factor. The spacetime rapidity and

proper time are deﬁne by η = (1/2) ln[(t + z)/(t − z)] and τ = √t2 − z2. This kind of smearing
function has been widely used in hydrodynamic simulations, e.g., in Refs. [73, 74]. The parameters
that we will use are the following. For RHIC Au + Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV: σr = 0.6
fm, ση = 0.6, K = 1.45, and τ0 = 0.4 fm; For LHC Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV:
σr = 0.6 fm, ση = 0.6, K = 1.6, and τ0 = 0.2 fm. The initial energy momentum tensor obtained
by using these parameters can ﬁt the experimental data quite well after the viscous hydrodynamic
evolution [73]. We note that the parameters K and τ0 in ΦG do not change the velocity because
they cancel out in Eq. (3.1) and Eq. (3.2); however, they do inﬂuence the values of energy density
and temperature.

We in Appendix C discuss another smearing function Φ∆(x, xi) and give the numerical result

for velocity ﬁeld computed by using Φ∆(x, xi).

We note that hv1i and hv2i are event-averaged v1 and v2, while hv3i and hv4i can be considered
as ﬁrst accumulating Ne events into one event and then calculating v1 and v2 of that event; hv3i
and hv4i cannot be deﬁned on event-by-event basis.

B. Deﬁnition of the vorticity and helicity ﬁelds

Once the speciﬁc deﬁnition of the velocity ﬁeld is given in numerical setup, the vorticity is

calculated according to

ω1 = ∇ × v,
ω2 = γ2∇ × v.

(3.14)
(3.15)

Note that we have neglected the O(v2) term γ2v × ∂tv in ω2 (see Eq. (2.11)) because, as we will
show, the velocity is small in the central overlapping region that we are most interested in. We will
also compute various helicity densities:

hf = v · ω1,
ω0
2 = v · ω2,
Ω0 = T 2v · ω2.

IV. GLOBAL ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND LOCAL SHEAR FLOW

As we have discussed in the Sec. I, in a non-central heavy-ion collision with impact parameter
b, the total angular momentum J0 of the two nuclei with respect to the collision center is roughly

10

FIG. 2: The impact parameter dependence of the angular momenta of the participents (black), the remnants
(red), and the QGP (blue) with respect to the collision center x = 0 for RHIC Au + Au collsions (Left) and
LHC Pb + Pb collisions (Right). The sum of the angular momenta of the remnants and the QGP is equal to
the angular momentum of the participants.

given by Ab√s/2. After the collision, a fraction of J0 is carried away by the spectators which
ﬂy rapidly apart from the collision region, the remained fraction of J0 is carried by the remnant
nucleons (the wounded participants with large longitudinal momenta) as well as the produced
QGP. In Fig. 2 we show our numerical simulations for the event-averaged angular momenta carried
by the participants, the remnants, and the QGP for Au + Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV and for
Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV. The results are obtained by averaging over 105 events. In
calculating the angular momentum, we use the formula

J = Z d3x(zT 0x − xT 0z).

(4.1)

Our results for the Au + Au collisions are qualitatively consistent with previous studies in
Refs. [38, 49, 54, 75]. We ﬁnd that about 10% of the angular momentum of the total participants
is retained by the QGP at mid-centrality region.

Such a global angular momentum of the QGP manifests itself mainly in the form of local ﬂuid
shear rather than a global rigid rotation. Our numerical result for the event-averaged longitudinal
shear ﬂow proﬁle at zero rapidity and b = 10 fm is presented in Fig. 3 (Left) for Au + Au collisions
at √s = 200 GeV and in Fig. 3 (Right) for Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV, where we show
hvzi(x) as a function of the transverse coordinate x for four different deﬁnitions of hvzi according
to Eq. (3.10) − Eq. (3.13). We emphasize that due to the use of the Gaussian smearing function
ΦG, hvzi(x) remains ﬁnite even for very large values of x where the QGP is not expected to
realistically exist. The simulation is more sensible for smaller values of x so that we will mainly
concentrate on the region near the collision center in the following discussions.

It is obvious that for given impact parameter, the angular momentum in Pb + Pb collisions at
√s = 2.76 TeV is larger than that in Au + Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV; however, Fig. 3 gives
that the longitudinal velocity at η = 0 for Pb + Pb collisions is smaller than that for Au + Au
collisions at the same impact parameter. As we checked that this is partially due to the fact that for

11

larger collision energy the moment of inertia of the partonic system is also larger and partially due
to that for larger collision energy the large-rapidity particles contribute more fraction of the total
angular momentum. We will give further discussion on this issue when we discuss the collision
energy dependence of vorticity in Sec. V B. The main information from Fig. 3 is that near the
center (x = 0) of the overlapping region, hvzi(x) grows with x and thus has a ﬁnite shear that
naturally suggests a ﬁnite local vorticity perpendicular to the reaction plane which we now study
in detail.

FIG. 3: The event-averaged longitudinal velocity proﬁle at zero rapidity for RIHC (Left) and LHC
(Right). Different curves correspond to different deﬁnitions of the event-averaged velocity, see Eq. (3.10)
− Eq. (3.13).

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR VORTICITY

A.

Impact parameter dependence

We begin by studying how the vorticity at τ = τ0 depends on the impact parameter b. For each
event, we compute the vorticity at η = 0 averaged over the overlapping region in the transverse
plane according to

d2x⊥n(x⊥)ω(x⊥)

d2x⊥n(x⊥)

¯ω ≡

if the vorticity is computed by using the particle ﬂow velocity v1, or

d2x⊥ε(x⊥)ω(x⊥)

d2x⊥ε(x⊥)

¯ω ≡

(5.1)

(5.2)

if the vorticity is computed by using the energy ﬂow velocity v2. In Eq. (5.1) and Eq. (5.2), ω
is representative of either ω1 or ω2, n(x⊥) and ε(x⊥) are the parton number density and energy
density obtained in HIJING, and x⊥ is the coordinate in the transverse plane. Such space-averaged
vorticity more appropriately reﬂects the strength of the vorticity acting on the whole overlapping

12

region. We then average ¯ω over 105 events to obtain the event-averaged space-averaged vorticity,
h ¯ωi, which we will call the double-averaged vorticity.
In Fig. 4, we show the y-component of the double-averaged vorticities h ¯ω1(τ0, η = 0)i and
h ¯ω2(τ0, η = 0)i for RHIC Au + Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV and LHC Pb + Pb collisions
at √s = 2.76 TeV. We have checked that after the event average the x and z components of the
vorticity are vanishing, as we expected from the left-right symmetry of the colliding geometry.

sizable, other components are negligibly small and are not drawn. Different curves correspond to different
deﬁnitions of vorticity and velocity.

First, we notice that the magnitude of the voriticy generated in either RHIC or LHC is big.
For example, h¯ωyi of the energy ﬂow v2 at b = 10 fm is about 1021s−1 or 20 MeV for RHIC Au
+ Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV. According to Eq. (1.2), the strength of axial CVE is roughly
proportional to T 2h¯ωyi ∼ 106 MeV3 if we plausibly assume T ∼ 300 MeV. This is competitive
to the strength of CSE in RHIC which is proportional to µeBy if the vector chemical potential is
π. Second, the vorticity of energy ﬂow is
about µ ∼ 10 MeV and the magnetic ﬁeld eBy ∼ 5m2
generally larger than the vorticity of particle ﬂow, in consistence with the longitudinal velocity
proﬁle, Fig. 3. Third, as b grows from zero, h¯ωyi ﬁrst increases and reaches its maximum value at
about b ≃ 2RA, after that the two nuclei are essentially not colliding and h¯ωyi drops. This behavior
is consistent with the fact that the angular momentum of the QGP shows a similar non-monotonous
feature.

Although the x and z components of the vorticity vanish after averaging over many events,
their magnitudes for each event can be ﬁnite due to the ﬂuctuation of the nucleon positions in the
nucleus. Such event-by-event ﬂuctuation of vorticity magnitude is characterized by h ¯ω2i which
we show in Fig. 5 where the vorticity is calculated based on the energy ﬂow v2. If there is no
event-by-event ﬂuctuation, h ¯ω2i should be equal to h¯ωyi2. But by comparing Fig. 5 with Fig. 4,
we observe clearly that h ¯ω2i > h¯ωyi2. This is most evident for b = 0 where h¯ωyi = 0 but h ¯ω2i
is still ﬁnite. Another feature that Fig. 5 exhibits is that for b & 2RA, unlike h¯ωyi, h ¯ω2i does not
drop, which indicating that the event-by-event ﬂuctuation of the vorticity is stronger for larger b.

√s = 200 GeV (Left) and LHC Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV (Right). Different curves correspond
to different deﬁnitions of the vorticity.

B. Collision energy dependence

FIG. 6: The collision energy dependence of the double-averaged vorticity h¯ω2yi at ﬁx τ = 0.4 fm and η = 0
computed by using the energy ﬂow velocity v2.

From Fig. 4, one can observe that, for given impact parameter, the vorticity for Pb + Pb col-
lisions at √s = 2.76 TeV is smaller than that for Au + Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV. This
suggests that the vorticity h¯ωyi decreases when the collision energy increases. We thus perform
the numerical simulation for h¯ω2yi of v2 at ﬁx τ = 0.4 fm and η = 0 in Au + Au collisions
with b = 10 fm at different √s. The result is drawn in Fig. 6 which shows clearly a decreas-
ing vorticity as √s increases. We note that similar feature was also observed in Ref. [56] where
the event-averaged moment-of-inertia weighted vorcity was computed. At ﬁrst sight, this behav-
ior looks contradicting the collision energy dependence of the angular momentum of QGP which
increases with √s (see Fig. 2), because the vorticity measures the local angular velocity of the
ﬂuid, thus the whole angular momentum of QGP would be roughly J ∼ R d3xI(x)ω(x) where
I(x) ∼ [x2−(x· ˆω)2]ε(x) is the moment of inertia density. However, as noticed in Ref. [56], with

14

increasing collision energy, the moment of inertia grows more rapidly than the increasing of the
total angular momentum of QGP, and thus makes the vorticity decrease. Furthermore, as we will
show in next subsection, with increasing collision energy, the vorticity becomes more and more
peaked at ﬁnite rapidity and thus the vorticity at η = 0 is relatively weakened.

C. Spatial distribution of vorticity

FIG. 7: The event-averaged vorticity as a function of x for RHIC Au + Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV
(Left) and LHC Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV (Right). Different curves represent different deﬁ-
nitions of vorticity (see Eq. (3.14) and Eq. (3.15)) based on different deﬁnitions of the velocity ﬁeld (see
Eq. (3.1) and Eq. (3.2)).

We show in Fig. 7 the event-averaged vorticity as a function of x (the coordinate in the impact
parameter direction). The full distribution of the vorticity (we present only hω2yi of v2 as an
example) in the transverse plane (the x − y plane) is shown in Fig. 8. Obviously, the vorticity
distributes in the transverse plane very inhomogeneously. From Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 we observe three
remarkable features. (1) From Fig. 8 we notice that hω2yi varies more steeply along the x direction
than along the y direction in consistence with the elliptic shape of the overlapping region. (2) From
Fig. 7, one ﬁnds that the magnitude of hωyi reaches its maximum value not at the center (x = 0)
but at a position xp which becomes larger for higher collision energy and ﬁnally becomes well
localized around the outer boundary of the overlapping region (we have checked this for collision
energy other than 200 GeV and 2.76 TeV). Note that although in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 it seems that the
vorticity of v2 at √s = 200 GeV peaks at x = 0, this is not the case as we have checked at higher
resolution near x = 0. (3) The vorticity drops steeply for x larger than xp. The vorticity of energy
ﬂow even shows a ﬂipping of direction at x ≫ xp which is due to the drop of hv2zi(x) at large x
as shown in Fig. 3. The last two features are closely related to the boundary of the overlapping
region and thus can be called a corona effect for vorticity which reﬂects the fact that near in the
boundary layers the velocity ﬁeld varies severely.

In Fig. 9 we show the double-averaged vorticity h¯ω2yi of energy ﬂow as a function of the
spacetime rapidity in Au + Au collisions for various collision energies. We ﬁnd that for collision

+ Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV (Left) and LHC Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV (Right).

FIG. 9: The double-averaged vorticity h¯ω2yi in Au + Au collisions calculated based on v2 as a function of

energy √s . 550 GeV h¯ω2yi peaks at zero rapidity (for our best resolution) while for √s > 550
GeV it peaks at a ﬁnite rapidity which increases as √s grows. This feature may be understood
by noticing that for ﬁxed proper time, the boundary of the collision region in the η direction is
increasing with √s; thus the appearance of the ﬁnite-rapidity peak may be also considered as a
corona effect in η direction.

D. Spatial distribution of helicity

We in this subsection present the spatial distribution of different kinds of helicity ﬁeld.

Fig. 10, we show hv · ω1i and hv · ω2i along the y axis for RHIC Au + Au collisions at √s =
200 GeV and LHC Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV. Clearly, the event-averaged helicity

In

different deﬁnitions of the vorticity and velocity ﬁelds.

is negative for y > 0 and positive for y < 0. This becomes more transparent in Fig. 11 where
we show the spatial distribution of hv · ω1i and hv · ω2i in the transverse plane. Clearly, the
reaction plane separates the region with positive event-averaged helicity from the region with
negative event-averaged helicity. Similar helicity separation is also observed in low energy heavy-
ion collisions [42]. In Fig. 12, the T 2-weighted helicity hT 2v2 · ω2i for RHIC Au + Au collisions
at √s = 200 GeV is presented; its physical meaning is given in Sec. II B. Comparing to h bv · ω1i
and hv · ω2i, hT 2v2 · ω2i is much more conﬁned in the overlapping region owing to the fact that
T (x⊥) is concentrated in the overlapping region.

The underling mechanism of the helicity separation is simply due to the fact that hvyi as a
function of y changes its sign from region with y > 0 to the region with y < 0 while hωyi does
not change the sign. This is similar with the electromagnetic helicity E · B in heavy-ion collisions
where Ey changes its sign from the region below and above the reaction plane but By does not [4].
The ﬂow helicity separation may have interesting experimental implication, for example, it may
generate chiral charges separation via the CVE [42].

E. Histogram of ψω − ψ2

As already mentioned in the Introduction, on the event-by-event basis the vorticity ﬁeld ﬂuctu-
ates not only in its magnitude but also in its azimuthal direction. The direction of ω is important
in experiments as the vorticity-driven effects will inherit this information and reﬂect it in the ﬁnal
obervables. Thus we in this and next subsection will study the event-by-event ﬂuctuation of the
azimuthal direction of ω with respect to the matter geometry (more speciﬁcally, the participant
plane) in detail. Our study will be parallel to the analogous study for electomagnetic ﬁelds in
Refs. [7, 57, 58]. For this purpose, we ﬁrst determine the participant-plane angle (more precisely,
the second harmonic component of the participants) ψ2 which is known to be ﬁrmly correlated
to the event plane angle or reaction plane angle. We use the following formula to deﬁne ψ2 and
⊥) where ρ(x⊥)

is the participant density projected onto the transverse plane.

In Fig. 13 we present the histogram of ψω − ψ2 modulo by π over 105 events for two different
centrality bins, b = 3 fm and b = 10 fm, for both RHIC Au + Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV
and LHC Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV, where ψω is the azimuthal direction of the space-
averaged vorticity, ¯ω2 based on v2 (calculations based on other deﬁnitions of the vorticity and
velocity show very similar results). The histograms have approximate Gaussian shapes centered
at ψω − ψ2 = π/2 with the corresponding variance widths very large for b = 3 fm and relatively
small at b = 10 fm. This shows that for central collisions the azimuthal direction of the vorticity
suffers from strong event-by-event ﬂuctuation which efﬁciently kills the correlation between ψω
and ψ2; while for noncentral collisions there is indeed a signiﬁcant correlations between the two

although suppressed by the ﬂuctuation as well. We now turn to more quantitative measure of the
correlation between ψω and ψ2.

F. Azimuthal correlation between vorticity and participant plane

To reveal the azimuthal correlation between the vorticity and the participant plane more quan-

titatively, we deﬁne the following two correlations,

R1 = hcos[2(ψω − ψ2)]i,
R2 =

1

h ¯ω2ih ¯ω2 cos[2(ψω − ψ2)]i,

(5.3)

(5.4)

where h· · ·i denotes the event average. Similar quantities were used to study the azimuthal cor-
relations between the magnetic ﬁeld and the participant plane, see Ref. [57, 58]. If there is no
correlation between the magnitude of the voriticity and its azimuthal direction, R2 should be re-
duced to R1.

Before showing the numerical results for R1 and R2, we discuss ﬁrst the physical signiﬁcance
of them. We take the chiral vortical effect (CVE) as an example; other vorticity induced effects can
be similarly analyzed. The CVE can induce a baryon number separation along the direction of the
voriticity which can be measured through the baryon-number-dependent two-particle correlation,

γαβ = hcos(φα + φβ − 2ψ2)i,

(5.5)

where α (and β) labels the baryon number of the measured particle, i.e., whether the measured
particle is a baryon or anti-baryon, and φα is the corresponding azimuthal angle. The CVE can
induce a special term into the two-particle distribution function of the measured hadrons,

f CVE
αβ ∝ ω2 cos(φα − ψω) cos(φβ − ψω).

(5.6)

This in turn translates into the following form,

f CVE
αβ ∝

cos[2(ψω − ψ2)] cos(φα + φβ − 2ψ2)

from which we can extract the correlation γαβ as

γαβ ∝ hω2 cos[2(ψω − ψ2)]i.

19

(5.7)

(5.8)

So if the vorticity is perfectly perpendicular to the participant plane, we would have that γαβ is
proportional to ω2. However, as we have seen from last subsection, this is not the case; the event-
by-event azimuthal ﬂuctuation of ω will provide a suppression factor given by R2.

FIG. 14: The correlation hcos[2(ψω − ψ2)]i as a function of impact parameter for both RHIC Au + Au
collisions at 200 GeV (Left) and LHC Pb + Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV (Right). The vorticity ﬁeld is calculated
based on the energy ﬂow velocity v2.

FIG. 15: The ω2-weighted correlation hω2 cos[2(ψω − ψ2)]i/hω2i as a function of impact parameter for

vorticity ﬁeld is calculated based on the energy ﬂow velocity v2.

The correlations R1 and R2 for both RHIC Au + Au collisions and LHC Pb + Pb collisions are
presented in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15. The vorticity ﬁelds are calculated based on velocity v2; but the

20

results based on velocity v1 are qualitatively the same. Evidently, the correlation between ψω and
ψ2 are suppressed comparing to the ideal case without ﬂuctuation, i.e., ψω − ψ2 = π/2. Both R1
and R2 are signiﬁcantly suppressed in the most central and most peripheral cases (indicating no
strong correlations) and are maximized around b ∼ 7 − 10 fm with peak magnitudes ∼ 0.8 for
RHIC and ∼ 0.7 for LHC. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that practically R1 ≃ R2 for both RHIC and LHC
cases suggesting no noticeable correlation between the magnitude and azimuthal direction of ω.
We note that all these features are very similar with that observed for magnetic ﬁeld [57, 58].

VI. ON THE TIME EVOLUTION OF THE VORTICITY

So far, we considered only the voriticity at the ﬁxed proper-time τ0. In this section we turn
to discuss the time evolution of the vorticity in the QGP by employing a hydrodynamic analysis.
We will not perform full viscous hydrodynamic simulations; instead, our discussion will be based
mainly on analytical estimation. We will restrict ourselves to the core domain of the overlapping
region where the ﬂow velocity v is small and we can use nonrelativistic vorticity ω1 = ∇ × v to
proceed with our analysis. To simplify the notation, we will denote ω1 by ω in this section.
The time evolution of the vorticity is goveined by the following vorticity equation [63],

∂ω
∂t

= ∇ × (v × ω) + ν∇2ω,

(6.1)

where ν = η/(ε+P ) = T −1(η/s) is the kinematic shear viscosity (η is the dynamic shear viscosity
and s is the entropy density). The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the convection term while the
second term represents the diffusion of ω due to shear viscosity. The ratio of these two terms is
characterized by the dimensionless Reynolds number,

Re = UL/ν,

(6.2)

where U is the characteristic velocity of the ﬂow and L is the characteristic length scale of the
ﬂuid. Although Eq. (6.1) is hard to solve in general, we can get important insight via analyzing
two limiting cases with Re ≪ 1 and Re ≫ 1 4.

If Re ≪ 1, the convection term can be neglected, and Eq. (6.1) becomes

∂ω
∂t

= ν∇2ω.

(6.3)

This is a diffusion equation whose solution is easily obtained by Fourier transformation (suppose
that ν is a constant),

ω(t, k) = ω(0, k)e−νk2t,

(6.4)

4 If we assume U ∼ 0.1 − 1, L ∼ 5 fm, T ∼ 300 MeV, and η/s ∼ 1/(4π) for a QGP produced at RHIC,
Re ∼ 10 − 100; at LHC Re would be even larger. Thus it is practically more reasonable to assume Re ≫ 1.

where ω(t, k) is the Fourier mode of ω(t, x) of wave-number k. Therefore, the vorticity will
decay exponentially with higher wave-number modes decaying faster. More speciﬁcally, for il-
lustration purpose, let us consider the initial vorticity distribution in the transverse plane to be a
Gaussian,

21

with σr a width parameter. The solution to Eq. (6.3) is then

Thus, for Gaussian initial proﬁle, the vorticity is nearly invariant for t ≪ tω = σ2
exponentially when t > tω. As we know that η/s for QGP is quite small, tω may be quite long.
This is very similar with the previous analysis for the time evolution of the magnetic ﬁeld in QGP
with a large electric conductivity but a small magnetic Reynolds number [76–78].

If Re ≫ 1, the diffusion term can be neglected, and Eq. (6.1) becomes

∂ω
∂t

= ∇ × (v × ω).

(6.7)

This is just Eq. (2.2). As well-known, this equation leads to the remarkable Helmholtz-Kelvin
theorem of circulation conservation (see Sec.II). In this case, the vortex lines are frozen in the
ﬂuid and the vorticity will decay due to the expansion of the system. To gain some quantitative
estimation of this expansion-driven decay, let us decompose the ﬂow velocity into two parts,

v = ve + vc,

(6.8)

where the ﬁrst part represents the expansion which we assume to be irrotational, ∇ × ve = 0,
and the second part represents the vortical ﬂow, vc = (1/2)ω × x. Let us consider a small region
around the collision center where the vorticity is along the y direction (after event-average) and can
be treated as constant (see Fig. 8). Then vc does not contribute to the right-hand side of Eq. (6.7)
and Eq. (6.7) becomes

∂ω
∂t

= ∇ × (ve × ω).

(6.9)

To proceed, let us assume a Bjorken expansion along the longitudinal direction and a pressure-
gradient driven expansion in the transverse plane. Thus

Because the early-time transverse expansion is slow, we adopt a linearized ideal hydrodynamic
equation to describe it,

proportional to t.

Finally, we emphasize again that the above analysis is justiﬁed only near the collision center; in
a region far from the collision center, there would be signiﬁcant correction due to relativistic ﬂow
and the novel spatial distribution of the vorticity. Thus, a full relativistic hydrodynamic simulation
is desirable to reveal the detailed time evolution of the vorticity covering more spatial region. An
early trial in this direction can be found in Ref. [40] where the time evolution of the longitudinal
momentum shear is computed in viscous hydrodynamics. Besides, the transport models like the
AMPT model may also be used to reveal the time evolution of the vorticity; recently, such a study
was performed by the authors of Ref. [56]. two limiting cases that we analyzed above.

VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In summary, we have studied the event-by-event generation of the ﬂow vorticity in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions by using the HIJING model. To perform the numerical simulation, we have
adopted a Gaussian smearing function (3.9) to deﬁne the velocity ﬁeld and based on which we have
computed the vorticity ﬁeld. Two types of velocity ﬁelds, namely, the particle ﬂow velocity v1 and
the energy ﬂow velocity v2 are deﬁned and two types of vorticity, namely, the nonrelativistic vor-
ticity ω1 and relativistic vorticity ω2 are simulated based on v1 and v2. From the simulations, we
ﬁnd that:
(1) In non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a sizable fraction of the angular momentum of
the two colliding nuclei are accumulated in the collision region. This fraction of angular momen-
tum is manifested in the form of longitudinal ﬂow shear which results in large local ﬂow vorticity.
After suitably averaged over the collision region and then over many events, the vorticity is found
to be perpendicular to the reaction plane.
(2) The vorticity is generally growing with the centrality when the impact parameter b . 2RA with
RA the radius of the nucleus; for b > 2RA it drops.
(3) Although the total angular momentum of the partonic matter increases with increasing colli-
sion energy, the event-averaged vorticity decreases with increasing collision energy.
(4) For large collision energy, a corona effect is seen in the spatial distribution of the event-
averaged vorticity, namely, the maximum vorticity is located around the boundary of the collision
region in both the transverse direction and in the spacetime rapidity direction.
(5) The event-averaged helicity density exhibits a clear dipolar distribution along the out-of-
reaction-plane direction.
(6) Both the magnitude and the azimuthal direction of the vorticity suffer from the event-by-event
ﬂuctuation. In particular, such ﬂuctuation blurs the vorticity from being perfectly perpendicular to
the reaction plane or participant plane. Quantitatively, the absolute values of correlations R1 and
R2 are suppressed by the event-by-event ﬂuctuation from being 1 to at most 0.8 for RHIC Au +
Au collisions at √s = 200 GeV and 0.7 for LHC Pb + Pb collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV.
(7) The time evolution of the vorticity is sensitive to the Reynolds number Re or equivalently the
shear viscosity of the QGP. If Re ≪ 1, the vorticity decays due to viscous diffusion. If Re ≫ 1,
the vortex lines are effectively frozen in the ﬂuid and the vorticity decays due to the hydrodynamic
expansion of the QGP.

The presence of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions can have interesting implications in experi-
ment observables, via, for example, the chiral vortical effect and chiral vortical wave. Our study
provides an important step towards quantifying these vorticity-driven effects in relativistic heavy-
ion collisions, but there are still many aspects of the vorticity as well as the effects it drives that
need to be explored, which will be the future tasks.

Appendix A: Vorticity for a ﬂuid with a conserved charge

We have noted in Sec. II B that for relativistic ﬂuid different vorticities can be deﬁned according
to the contexts of application. If the ﬂuid carries a conserved charge, one can deﬁne the vorticity
tensor as

˜Ωµν = ∂µ(wuν) − ∂ν(wuµ),

(A1)

where w = (ε+P )/n is the enthalpy per particle with n being the density of the conserved charge.
The circulation in correspondence to ˜Ωµν is

I wuµdxµ.

(A2)

By using the thermodynamic identities, dε = wdn + nT d(s/n) and dP = ndw − nT d(s/n) (s is
the entropy density), it is straightforward to recast Eq. (2.16) to

which can be rewritten as the following form (known as the Carter-Lichnerowicz equation)

d
dτ

(wuµ) = ∂µw + T∇µ(s/n),

˜Ωµνuν = T∇µ(s/n).

(A3)

(A4)

Thus for isentropic ﬂow, i.e., s/n is strictly constant, one obtains the following circulation conser-
vation: 5

Thus for isentropic ﬂuid we have ∂µ ˜Ωµ = 0 which implies that R d3x ˜Ω0 is conserved. This is the

relativistic version of the helicity conservation for ﬂuid with a conserved charge.

5 The isentropic condition can be relaxed. In fact, a weaker version of circulation conservation can hold following

directly the Carter-Lichnerowicz equation [80, 81].

momentum tensor of ideal ﬂuid (where µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3)

where P and ε are pressure and energy density, and uµ = γ(1, v) is the velocity of energy ﬂow:

T µν = (ε + P )uµuν − P gµν,

(B1)

From Eq. (B1), we obtain

T µνuν = εuµ.

va

1 + (va)2 =

T 0a

T 00 + T aa ,

(B2)

(B3)

where a = 1, 2, 3 and the repeated indices are not summed. Solving this equation for va, we get

va =

1 − √1 − 4V 2

2V

,

with V ≡ T 0a/(T 00 + T aa). In case that V is not large, we have

va ≈

T 0a

T 00 + T aa .

(B4)

(B5)

This expression is used to deﬁne v2 is Sec. III A.

In the proper-time coordinates, ˜xµ = (τ, x, y, η) with the proper time τ = √t2 − z2 and space-
time rapidity η = (1/2) ln[(t + z)/(t − z)] or inversely t = τ cosh η and z = τ sinh η. The corre-
sponding metric is ˜gµν = diag(1,−1,−1,−τ 2) and its inverse is ˜gµν = diag(1,−1,−1,−1/τ 2).
Let Aµ(x) be a vector written in the Cartesian coordinates and its corresponding counterpart in the
proper-time coordinates is ˜Aµ(˜x). The transformation between Aµ and ˜Aµ is given by

A0(x) =

˜Aτ (˜x) + z ˜Aη(˜x),

τ

z
τ

Ax(x) = ˜Ax(˜x),
Ay(x) = ˜Ay(˜x),
Az(x) =

˜Aτ (˜x) + t ˜Aη(˜x).

Or in a compact form, Aµ(x) = Λµ

ν ˜Aν[˜x(x)], with the transformation matrix given by

(Λµ

ν) =




t
τ , 0, 0, z

.

These relations are used in our computations. Especially, at zero rapidity, the two coordinate
systems coincide with each other which simplify our computations.

Appendix C: Another method to extract the velocity ﬁeld

The numerical result for the velocity ﬁeld depends on the choice of the smearing function
Φ(x, xi). In the main text, we use the Gaussian smearing method. In this Appendix, we discuss
another smearing function which generalizes δ(3)[x− xi(t)] (which corresponds to zero smearing)
to

Φ∆(x, xi) = δ(3)

∆ (x − xi(t)),

(C1)
which is deﬁned as follows. If |x − xi(t)| < ∆x,|y − yi(t)| < ∆y,|z − zi(t)| < ∆z, then
δ(3)
∆ (x − xi(t)) = 1; otherwise it is zero. In practical simulation, such a smearing can be achieved
by discretizing the space into small cells of volume ∆x∆y∆z and the velocity at point x is set to
be the velocity of the cell that x belongs to. Such a smearing is widely used in transport models.
Recently, the voticity ﬁeld was computed in Hadron-String Dynamics model [55] and A Multi-
Phase Transport(AMPT) model [56] by using such a method to deﬁne the velocity ﬁeld.

The event-averaged longitudinal velocity proﬁle at τ = 0 computed by using the above method
is shown in Fig. 16 which we run 107 events and choose ∆x = ∆y = 1 fm and ∆z = ∞.
We checked that varying ∆x and ∆y from 0.1 fm to 2 fm results no more than 10% variation
in velocity. The behavior at small s is similar with the result obtained by using ΦG. At large x,
the two smearing methods give different results. Particularly, Φ∆ does not lead to ﬁnite hvzi for
x > RA + b/2 where RA is the radius of the nucleus.
