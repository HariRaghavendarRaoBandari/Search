Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) lidar, as a novel remote sensing technique,
has been receiving increasing interest
in recent years. By combining
pulse-compression technique and coherent detection with GI, we propose
a new lidar system called pulse-compression GI lidar. Our analytical
results, which are backed up by numerical simulations, demonstrate that
pulse-compression GI lidar can obtain the target’s spatial intensity dis-
tribution, range and moving velocity. Compared with conventional pulsed
GI lidar system, pulse-compression GI lidar, without decreasing the range
resolution, is easy to obtain high single pulse energy with the use of a long
pulse, and the mechanism of coherent detection can eliminate the inﬂuence
of the stray light, which can dramatically improve the detection sensitivity
and detection range.

Introduction

Ghost imaging (GI) is a novel non-scanning imaging method to obtain a target’s image with
a single-pixel bucket detector [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Due to the capability of high detection sen-
sitivity, GI has a great application prospect in remote sensing and some kinds of GI imaging
lidar system have been proposed [8, 9, 10, 11]. Recently, a pulsed three-dimensional (3D) GI
lidar was invented and high-resolution 3D image of a natural scene at about 1.0 km range
was reported [12]. In this system, the range image was obtained by using simple pulse rang-
ing method, while the azimuth images were reconstructed by computing intensity ﬂuctuation-
correlation function between the receiving signal and reference spatial intensity distribution.
Because pulsed 3D GI lidar employs direct energy detection, it requires both high peak power
and high single pulse energy to obtain sufﬁcient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). What’s more, the
range resolution of pulsed 3D GI lidar is determined by the laser’s pulse width. In order to
obtain high range resolution, it requires a laser with shorter pulse width and a detector with
boarder response bandwidth, which usually means that the transmitting system’s single pulse
energy will be relative low for pulsed 3D GI lidar with a high pulse repetition frequency (PRF).
However, for pulsed 3D GI lidar, the detection range mainly depends on single pulse energy,
thus high range resolution and long detection range can not be simultaneously achieved.

Coherent detection and pulse-compression technique is valid to solve the conﬂict described
above in chirped amplitude modulated (Chirped-AM) lidar [13, 14]. A Chirped-AM light is
emitted, and the return light is received by coherent detection and pulse-compression. Based
on this technique, high range resolution and long detection range can be obtained simultane-
ously [15]. Meanwhile, Chirped-AM lidar can achieve the velocity of a moving target [16].
Therefore, if we add chirped modulation to pseudo-thermal light source and use coherent de-
tection method to gain the signals reﬂecting from targets, it is possible to propose a new GI lidar
(called pulse-compression GI lidar) with better abilities, which may overcome the difﬁculties
faced with pulsed GI lidar. The paper is organized as follows: in Section II, the system setup
and theoretical scheme, including the signal model, light propagation, signal detection, image
reconstruction and correction method, is presented; after that, in section III, the numerical re-
sults are presented to back up our theoretical result and some discussions on our proposed GI
lidar and conventional pulsed 3D GI lidar are given; in Section IV, the conclusion is made.

chirped waveform s (t) for the modulator. The chirped-AM light is split into two parts: detect-
ing light and local oscillator (LO). The spatiotemporal modulated light Es (xs,t) is obtained by
passing the AM detecting light through a rotating ground glass. Then the light is divided by
a beam splitter (BS) into a reference and a test paths. In the reference path, the light is trans-
formed into the far ﬁeld by an fr- fr optical system and the spatial intensity distribution Ir (xr)
is recorded by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. In the test path, the light illuminates
a 3D target located in the far region of source (namely the rotating ground glass plane). The
backscattered light from the target is coupled into a optical ﬁber and then mixed with LO light
in a 2*4 optical hybrid. The four output ports of the optical hybrid are connected to two bal-
anced detectors where de-chirping is performed. After two bandpass ﬁlters (BPF), the complex
de-chirped current ˜i (xt,t) is frequency-analyzed by a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) process and
the corresponding intensity spectrum It (xt , f ) can be obtained.

According to GI theory [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the intensity ﬂuctuation correlation function between

the distribution Ir (xr) and the intensity spectrum It (xt , f ) can be expressed as

D G(2,2) (xr,xt , f ) = hIr (xr)It (xt , f )i − hIr (xr)i hIt (xt , f )i ,

(1)

where < · > denotes ensemble average of a function.

Since the temporal bandwidth of chirped waveform s (t) is narrow relative to the optical
frequency, the spatiotemporal modulated light ﬁeld can be treated as a quasi-monochromatic,
classical scalar wave [17]. The complex envelope of the spatiotemporal light through the rotat-
ing ground glass can be described as

Es,n (xs,t) = [1 + ms (t − nT )]P (t − nT ) Es,n (xs) ,

(2)

where m is the modulation depth, n denotes the nth pulse, and T is the pulse interval; P(t)
is simple pulse waveform and is limited in T0 (T0 < T ); Es,n (xs) = An (xs) exp [ jf n (xs)] is the
spatial amplitude and phase modulation with the following statistical moment

The propagation of light ﬁeld is described by extended Huygens Fresnel principle [18]. For

sity during the pulse duration, the light intensity distribution In (xr) is

In the test path, the light illuminates the target at range zi, and the backscattered light of the

target propagates to the receiving aperture plane. The light ﬁeld at the target plane zi is

where xt denotes the transverse coordinate at the receiving aperture and ozi (xo) is the average

As depicted in Fig. 1, the target is modeled as a set of quasi planar, spatial extended objects
s /l
that are located at discrete range zi, and the distance zi satisﬁes that Min(zi) > D2
(namely in
the far ﬁeld of the source), where Ds is the transverse size of the laser beam on the ground glass
plane, and Min(zi) is the minimum distance between the target and the source. Moreover, the
light illuminating the planar object at certain range cannot reach the object on the plane behind,
which means those planar objects have no transverse overlap. Then the total light ﬁled at the
receiving aperture plane is given by

If the target moves along the optical axis, the range can be described as zi = zi0 + vit, where
zi0 is the range at t = 0, and vi is the radial velocity. Due to the high PRF, the sampling time is

so short that the target can be supposed to stay in a range resolution cell for simplicity. Then

The LO light ﬁled is assumed to be uniform, namely

ELO,n (xt,t) = [1 + ms (t − nT )] P(t − nT ) ALO exp [ jf LO,n] ,

(11)
where ALO and f LO,n is the amplitude and the known phase of the nth LO pulse, respectively. In
coherent detection system, the signal light must be spatially coherent at the receiving aperture
to obtain maximum mixing efﬁciency. Suppose the transverse scale of the target is L, and then
the transverse coherent length of light ﬁeld on receiving aperture is ∼ l zi/L , which means our
receiver size should not exceed this constraint [19]. The 2*4 optical hybrid mixes the signal
light with four quadrature states associated with the LO light ﬁeld, and then delivers the four
light signals to two balanced detectors. The interference items of in-phase (I) and quadrature
(Q) channels can be written as [20]

Optical mixing and de-chirping process happens simultaneously in balanced detectors. By
using two proper BPFs, we can achieve the oscillating component of the photocurrent that
varies harmonically with Doppler frequency and range frequency. The output currents are

Eq. (16) suggests that the angular resolution is l /Ds and the range resolution is c/2B. Mean-
while, the target’s information can be extracted with the use of a single point-like detector
when the measurement process reaches ensemble average. However, in practice, in order to
obtain a proper information output rate, the measurement number is usually small and coherent
detection efﬁciency experiences signiﬁcant degradation due to the ﬂuctuation of the backscat-
tered light ﬁeld, thus the visibility of GI with a single coherent detector is very poor [22].
Following Ref. [23], we can employ a random sparse coherent detection array to improve the
detection SNR by summing the restored intensity spectrums, which is equivalent to increasing
the measurement number and the visibility of GI will be enhanced.

Moreover, if the target contains moving planar object, Eq. (16) implies that the range fre-
b /c . Based on Doppler frequency
quency is blurred with Doppler frequency, i.e. fbi = fdi + 2zi0
and the recovered tomographic images, we try to obtain the correct range information. The most
important step is to determine whether the reconstructed image is from a static scatter or a mov-
ing scatter. According to Eq. (16), the corresponding tomographic images in different frequency
f can be independently reconstructed. Because the target doesn’t overlap in transverse dimen-
sion, if there is no overlap for all tomographic images at xr = xro, then the scatter is static,
whereas if there is overlap for two tomographic images at xr = xro, then the corresponding
scatter is moving. The corrected range and velocity can be expressed as

z = c ( fb − fd) /2b
v = l

fd/2 ,

(17)

Therefore, the target’s spatial intensity distribution, range and moving velocity can be achieved
by pulse-compression GI lidar.

3. Simulation results and Discussion

In order to verify the analytical results of our proposed pulse-compression GI lidar above,
we give some numerical simulations and Fig. 2 shows the simulation process. The spa-
tial temporal source is discretized as a two-dimensional (2D) lattices, namely Ei, j (t) =
[1 + ms (t)]Ai, j exp [ jf i, j]. Following Ref. [24], the amplitude and phase are statistically inde-
pendent of each other. And all element sources are independent identically distributed. The am-
plitude Ai, j obeys Rayleigh distribution and the phase f i, j is uniformly distributed on (0, 2p ).
The reference intensity distribution Ir,n (xr) is obtained by computing Eq. (5). In the test path,
the target’s reﬂection function is discretized as a set of 2D lattices, corresponding to different
planar objects. Since the planar objects do not occlude each other, the propagation of each
planar object can be computed independently. The spatiotemporal light ﬁelds Eo,zi,n (xo,t) and
Et,zi,n (xt ,t) are achieved by computing the numerical result of Eq. (6) and Eq. (7), respectively.
To demonstrate our Lidar’s performance in scenarios with stray light, a random stray light ﬁeld
Est (xt ,t) is generated at receiving aperture plane. Following Eq. (9), the total ﬁeld Et,n (xt ,t) at

the receiving aperture is the coherent superposition of all planar objects’ return ﬁled and stray
light.

The detection process is simulated by computing Eq. (12) and (13). By using a digital BPF,
we can get the baseband current ˜in (xt ,t), corresponding to Eq. (14). To simulate a random
sparse detection array, we randomly pick up some positions on the receiving aperture plane, as
shown in Fig. 2. After FFT process, the intensity spectrum It,k,n (xt, f ) can be obtained, where k
denotes the kth detector at xt. At last, the image of pulse-compression GI lidar is reconstructed
by computing the following correlation function

In the numerical simulations, the speciﬁc parameters are set as follows: Ds=2mm, T =1ms,
m=1, and B=1GHz. As shown in Fig. 1, the three planar objects are the identical double slit
(slit width a=0.5m, slit height h=1.5m, and center-to-center separation d=0.87m) at different
ranges (object 1 at 199.9m, object 2 at 200m and object 3 at 200.3m) with different transverse
positions. For the scenario with moving components, object 1 and 2 has a radial velocity 0.1
m/s and 0.2 m/s respectively, while object 3 is static.

Fig. 3 presents the results of pulse-compression GI lidar for a static scenario. Column (1) is

computing Eq. (19), the corresponding reconstruction images for the labeled peak frequency
components P1 and P2 are illustrated in Column (2). As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), the intensity
spectrum’s SNR for a single coherent detector is low and so does the GI reconstruction result.
However, when some random sparse receivers are used to collect the backscattered light from

Fig. 3. Simulation results of pulse-compression GI lidar for a static scenario (consist of
three planar objects). (a), (b) and (c) are the intensity spectrum and image reconstruction
results by using 1, 25, and 100 coherent receivers, respectively (averaged 20000 measure-
ments); Column (1) and (2) present the intensity spectrum, GI reconstruction results for
peak frequency component P1 and P2, respectively.

the target, both the intensity spectrum’s SNR and the reconstruction quality of GI dramatically
increase with the number of receivers. In addition, as predicted by the theory, the range resolu-
tion of pulse-compression GI lidar is c/2B=0.15m, thus the spectrum of the object 1 and object
2 cannot be resolved and as shown in Column (2), both the object 1 and object 2 appear in the
same tomographic image.

When image a scenario with moving objects, Fig. 4(a) presents the intensity spectrum of the
random sparse detection array with 100 detectors. The peaks P3 and P4 are corresponding to
the Doppler frequency and the peaks P5-P7 are the blurred range frequency components. The
corresponding reconstructed images for the peak frequency components P3-P7 are shown in
Figs. 4(b)-(f). According to the image correction process described above, we can identify that
Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(e) correspond to the same planar object (namely the image of object 1),
Fig. 4(d) is a static object (namely the image of object 3), while Fig. 4(c) and Fig. 4(f) are the
image of object 2. In addition, by computing Eq. (18), the correct ranges and velocities are
z1 = 199.88m, v1 = 0.0996m/s, z2 = 199.97m, v2 = 0.199m/s and z1 = 200.28m. Therefore,
the range resolution can be also enhanced if the Doppler information of the object is used.

To illustrate the performance of pulse-compression GI lidar in scenarios with stray light, we
carry out a comparison between conventional pulsed GI lidar and pulse-compression GI lidar.
Using the same simulation parameters of Fig. 3 and 25 random sparse detectors, Fig. 5 gives the
reconstruction results of conventional pulse GI lidar and pulse-compression GI lidar when the
detection SNR for a single detector is 1dB, 3dB, 5dB, and 10 dB, respectively. It is clearly seen
that the reconstruction quality of pulse GI lidar increases with the detection SNR. However,
pulse-compression GI lidar hardly depends on the detection SNR because the LO light does’t

inﬂuence of the stray light.

4. Conclusion

In summary, we demonstrate by theoretical analysis and numerical simulation that coherent
detection and pulse compression can be applied in GI lidar to image a 3D scenario with moving
components. The emitting laser is spatiotemporally modulated, and the received pulse is de-
chirped in optical domain using coherent detection. The proposed pulse-compression GI lidar

uses low peak power pulse and low sampling rate to obtain high range resolution. Compared
with conventional pulsed 3D GI lidar, pulse-compression GI lidar can effectively eliminate the
inﬂuence of the stray light to the imaging quality, which is very useful to weak remote sensing.
