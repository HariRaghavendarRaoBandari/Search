Cosmological hysteresis is a purely thermodynamical phenomenon caused by the gradient in pres-
sure, hence the characteristic equation of state during the expansion and contraction phases of the
universe are diﬀerent, provided that the universe bounces and recollapses. During hysteresis pres-
sure asymmetry is created due to the presence of a single scalar ﬁeld in the dynamical process. Also
such an interesting scenario has vivid implications in cosmology when applied to variants of modiﬁed
gravity models described within the framework of membrane paradigm. Cyclic universe along with
scalar ﬁeld leads to the increase in the amplitude of the cosmological scale factor at each consecutive
cycles of the universe. Detailed analysis shows that the conditions which creates a universe with

an ever increasing expansion, depend on the signature of the hysteresis loop integral(cid:72) pdV and on

membrane model parameters.

INTRODUCTION

Magnetic and electric materials often show a phenomenon known as hysteresis, which corresponds to a dynamical
lag between its input and output. This leads to the formation of what is commonly known as the hysteresis loop.
Such a phenomenon can also be created in the cosmological world, referred to as “Cosmological Hysteresis”, in the
presence of cyclic universe ( [1–3]), which bounces and recollapses repeatedly.

As we know, a universe with identical cycles fails to solve the main problems of Big Bang model-the requirement
of very special and ﬁnely-tuned initial conditions to allow the universe to evolve to its current state. These problems
are commonly known as horizon and ﬂatness problem, where the former refers to the incapability of Big Bang model
to explain the near homogeneity of CMB even though the comoving scales entering the horizon today have been far
outside the horizon at CMB decoupling, and the latter refers to the requirement of an extremely ﬁne tuning of the
curvature parameter close to zero in the early universe to explain the near-ﬂatness observed today. However, the
curvature parameter begin inversely proportional to the scale factor of the universe, a way out is to generate a cyclic
universe with an increasing amplitude of the scale factor after each cycle.

One way to develop such a scenario is to create an inequality between the pressures at the time of expansion and
contraction phases of the universe. This leads to the growth of both energy and entropy of the universe after each
cycle. Tolman in his paper [4] postulated that the presence of a viscous ﬂuid could create such disparity between the
expansion and contraction phases. This unusual approach, though resulted in an inevitable increase in entropy, helped
in solving the horizon and ﬂatness problem due to the creation of an oscillating universe with increasing expansion
maximum, hence an increasing volume V of the universe, after each cycle. Thus he showed a novel way of linking
thermodynamical principles to the model of cyclic universe.

Another novel way of creating the pressure (denoted as p) asymmetry is through the presence of a scalar ﬁeld.

Such a scenario was proposed by the authors in [5, 6]. Scalar ﬁeld aﬀects the dynamics in a way that maintains the
symmetric nature of the equation of motion (thereby avoiding entropy production) which is an advantage over the

Tolman model. Such a scenario aiding a cyclic universe leads to the production of hysteresis, deﬁned as(cid:72) pdV (work

done on/by the scalar ﬁeld during one complete cycle), during each oscillatory cycle. The loop area, hence asymmetry,
is largest in case of inﬂationary potentials. But the phenomenon of hysteresis is independent of the nature of potential.
Any potential with proper minimum/minima which results in phase mixing of the scalar ﬁeld during expansion, is
capable of causing the phenomenon of hysteresis. In order to avoid singularity (another serious drawback of Big Bang
model), this phenomenon is applied to models where singularity is replaced by bounce and big crunch replaced by
re-collapse or turnaround. Though there exist several other models [7–9] which succeeded in solving the horizon and
ﬂatness problems, none of them could avoid big bang singularity.

In this paper, we have further applied the above thermodynamical phenomenon of hysteresis to higher dimensional
brane world models, Einstein Gauss-Bonnet (EHGB) brane world gravity model and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP)
braneworld model. Both these models are braneworld models of the universe in which the observable universe is a
four dimensional timelike hypersurface (brane) embedded in a higher dimensional (bulk) space-time, where the extra
dimension can be both time-like or space-like. In both these models, one sees the eﬀect of modifying the gravity
sector in the action. These models have acquired a lot of attention at present, mainly because they arise naturally
in superstring theories (which requires the existence of higher dimensions) and more so because they are falsiﬁable.
These models have several interesting cosmological features in the early and present universe and can also explain the
present cosmological scenario successfully. Hence, in this paper, we try to test these models for cosmological hysteresis.
It will be very interesting to check whether the phenomenon of hysteresis, when applied to brane world models, results
in a universe with increasing expansion volume. Then such a scenario can act as an alternate solution to inﬂation in
future, once it explains other observations like structure formations, CMB, etc.. Another advantage of studying these
models in the context of hysteresis, is the presence of elements which can cause bounce and turnaround in the universe,
a prime requirement in the present context. In this present work, though our analysis has been restricted to brane
world models, one can always extend this scenario to other modiﬁed gravity models. For a complete analysis for other
models one may refer to [10, 11]. A notable feature of this analysis is that an increase in expansion maximum after

each cycle now depends on the sign of(cid:72) pdV and also on the parameters of the model. Hence applying these models

to this unusual scenario (bounce+hysteresis) helps to put constraints on the EHGB and DGP model parameters.
Though the analysis that we have performed holds good under certain physically acceptable approximations and
limiting cases, we can at least show that if there are any limiting cases of the models which can give rise to the
phenomenon of cosmological hysteresis.

Though the phenomenon of hysteresis is commonly attached to magnetic and electric systems, there are various
advantages which a cyclic universe along with the phenomenon of hysteresis within the framework of membrane
paradigm, enjoys over other models:

• The phenomenon of hysteresis is important due to the simplicity with which it can be generated. Only a thermo-
dynamic interplay between the pressure and density, creating an asymmetry during expansion and contraction
phase of the universe, succeeds in causing cosmological hysteresis.

• As the phenomena of cosmological hysteresis deals with the bouncing as well as the recollapsing phase of the
universe, one can avoid the appearance of Big Bang Singularity as well as the Big Crunch at early and late
times.

• Hysteresis can be generated by the presence of a single scalar ﬁeld, which has already been studied for a wide
variety of physical situations. The most exciting issue is, it do not require any other ﬁelds for its occurrence.
Hence it is very easy to handle and its properties can be studied extensively in cosmological literature.

• A cyclic universe having the conditions to cause hysteresis, can solve all the Big Bang puzzles (horizon and ﬂat-
ness problem), hence can act as an alternative proposal to inﬂation, if it explains other observations successfully.
• In this scenario, we can always start with a closed or open universe and after allowing the universe go through
a number of cycles, we get the present observable ﬂat universe. In this paper, we will extensively deal with
the eﬀect of hysteresis on such higher dimensional models that can give rise to such cyclic universe. Through
analytical calculations, we will show that irrespective of the nature of the universe, we can get a cyclic model
with increasing amplitude of the scale factor.

II. DYNAMICS LEADING TO HYSTERESIS

The scalar ﬁeld equation of motion in the spatially ﬂat FLRW cosmological background is given by:

¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V

(cid:48)

(φ) = 0 .

3

(1)

Here H is the Hubble parameter, φ is the scalar ﬁeld and V (φ) is the potential for the ﬁeld φ.

Let us also discuss about the origin of cosmological hysteresis scenario following:
• If we closely analyse Eq (1), then we ﬁnd that when the universe expands i.e. H > 0 the second term 3H ˙φ
acts as friction and opposes the motion of the scalar ﬁeld, thus producing a damping eﬀect during its motion,
when the universe expands (H > 0). This lowers the kinetic energy of the scalar ﬁeld compared to its potential
energy, giving rise to a soft equation of state (P = −ρ in case ˙φ2/2 << V (φ) i.e. slow roll regime).

• By contrast, in a contracting (H < 0) phase of the universe, when the Universe enters a contracting (H < 0)
phase, the term 3H ˙φ behaves like anti-friction and favours the motion of the scalar ﬁeld, thereby accelerating
it. This makes the kinetic energy of the scalar ﬁeld much larger than the potential energy, giving rise to stiﬀ
equation of state (P = ρ in case ˙φ2/2 >> V (φ)).

• Hence, from the second law of thermodynamics, we can convey that a net diﬀerence in the pressure (during
expansion and contraction cycle) leads to a non-zero work done by/on the scalar ﬁeld.
In addition, if we
now generate a scenario leading to the presence of bouncing and recollapsing mechanisms during contraction
and expansion respectively, one can expect that a non-zero work done during a given oscillatory cycle to be
converted into the energy of expansion of the universe, resulting in the growth in the maximum amplitude and
hence maximum volume of the universe of each successive expansion cycle. Thus producing older and larger
cycles.

• In [6], using simple thermodynamic arguments, the authors have related the change in maximum amplitude of
the scale factor after successive cycles to the work done. They have shown that these equations have a universal
form which is independent of the scalar ﬁeld potential responsible for hysteresis.

• As has been discussed in [6], though the process is independent of the potential, “the presence of hysteresis is
closely linked to the ability of the ﬁeld φ to oscillate”. This requires the presence of potential minimum/minima
in order to make the ﬁeld oscillate. As a result oscillations of the scalar ﬁeld during expansion randomises its
phase, thereby making all values of ˙φ equally likely at turnaround. Thus assuring that the values of φ and ˙φ,
when the universe turns around and contracts, are nearly uncorrelated with its phase space value when the ﬁeld
φ began oscillating. As a result, the ﬁeld almost always rolls up the potential along the diﬀerent phase space
trajectory compared to the one along which it had descended during expansion.

• This gives rise to the pressure asymmetry during expansion and contraction hence to non-zero work done,

thereby leading to the phenomenon of “cosmological hysteresis”.

It has been ﬁrst pointed out in [5] that when we plot the equation of state given by w = p/ρ vs the scale factor a from
a speciﬁed cosmological model, we get a hysteresis loop whose area contributes to the work done by/on the scalar
ﬁeld during expansion and contraction of the Universe. The general expression for the work done by/on the scalar
ﬁeld during one cycle is given by

(cid:73)

(cid:90)

(cid:90)

pdV =

pdV +

pdV.

(2)

In the present context, the volume of the universe is given by V = a3. The signature of the integral depends on the
relative pressure diﬀerence between the contraction and expansion phase i.e pcont > pexp, then the overall signature of

the pdV work done is negative or,(cid:72) pdV < 0. and vice versa. Fig. 1 shows the graphical plot between the equation of

cont

state and scale factor of the universe. It illustrates the phenomenon of cosmological hysteresis. For completeness also
in table I, we have mentioned the proper analogy between cosmological hysteresis and magnetic hysteresis scenario.
Now following the proposal of [5, 6], we know that in order to get a cyclic universe, the condition for bounce and

turn around are given by:

1. Bounce- H = 0 and ¨a > 0,

2. Turn around- H = 0 and ¨a < 0.

In this paper we will discuss the analysis leading to bounce, turnaround and hysteresis for EHGB and DGP model
. Fig. 2 shows the basic methodology/steps for our present analysis schematically. In this paper, we have discussed
the ﬁrst two steps in detail for both EHGB and DGP model. The rest have been discussed in [10].

Here the necessary conditions leading to bounce and turnaround for space-like extra-dimension have been discussed.

For the analysis in the presence of time-like extra-dimension one may refer to[10].
• Condition for bounce:
As we know, bounce occurs when the universe reaches its minimum radius amin and maximum density ρb. In this
setup such a state of minimum radius is achieved by the universe when

(9)

The expression for change in amplitude of the scale factor at each successive cycle is given by:

Here X(cid:48) is a new model dependent parameter which is a function of A, B and C (for complete expression, one may
refer to [10]). Thus we see that the condition for an increase in the amplitude of the scale factor depends on A
through X(cid:48), which in turn depends on the amplitude and sign of the curvature parameter k and the model parame-
ters like µ, α etc. In Fig. 3, we have shown an example illustrating the phenomenon of bounce for k = +1 in this setup.

Thus it implies that whether the condition for acceleration violates the energy condition, now depends upon the
values of diﬀerent parameters of the EHGB model present in the above expression.

• Condition for turnaround:
Turnaround or re-collapse occurs when the Universe reaches its maximum radius amax and minimum density.
Following the same line of treatment as for bounce, the condition for turnaround is

where i and (i − 1) refer to the two successive cycles i.e. ith and (i − 1)th cycle of expansion and contraction phase
of the Universe. Using the Friedmann equations for EHGB model, one can get the corresponding expression for work
done in one cycle for this model. The complete expression has been shown in [10], from which we can conclude that
the work done now depends not only on the scale factor, but also on the diﬀerent parameters of the model like the
coupling constant, brane tension etc. within the present setup.

In order to get exact expressions for the evolution of the scale factor and scalar ﬁeld with time, one needs to solve
the Friedmann equations under certain limiting conditions and valid approximations. It can also be shown that we
get a non zero expression for the total work done in one cycle under such conditions. Thus, choosing the model
parameters properly, we can get an overall increase in the scale factor after one complete cycle of expansion and
contraction. For more details see [10].

7

As a veriﬁcation of our claim, we have shown in Fig. 4 the evolution of scale factor and potential during expansion
and contraction phase (single cycle) for Einstein Gauss Bonnet gravity model. Fig. 4 has been obtained for Hilltop
potential (choosing speciﬁc values for the parameters) where the form of the potential is given by [13]:

(cid:20)

(cid:18) φ

(cid:19)p(cid:21)

M4

V (φ) = V0

1 + β

where V0 = M 4 is the tunable energy scale and β is the index which characterizes the feature of the potential. In
principle β can be both positive and negative. Additionally it is important to note that, in the present context, V0
mimics the role of vacuum energy.

Thus looking at ﬁg. 4, we can clearly say that, after the universe completes one cycle, there is a net increase in the

amplitude of the scale factor of the universe.

But we can always repeat the above analysis for any potential with proper minimum/minima. In [10], we repeated
the above analysis for two other forms of the potential and have found that choosing appropriate values for the model
and potential parameters, we get an increase in scale factor after one cycle.

• Condition for bounce:

In the early universe, at high energy or equivalently in the high density regime of the braneworld, ρr2
can expand Eq. (16) as [15]. To a ﬁrst order approximation, setting H = 0, we get the density at which bounce
occurs as

From the above expression we clearly see that, simialr to EGB model, here also the change in amplitude of the scale
factor after each cycle depends on the sign of the integral, the curvature parameter and the cross over length scale
for DGP braneworld. It is, though, independent of the density of the matter content of the universe. In Fig. 5, we
have shown an example illustrating the phenomenon of bounce for k = +1 in this setup.

of Mp = 1, H0 = 1, c = 1, where Mp is the Planck mass, H0 is the present value of the Hubble parameter and c is the speed
of light.

• Condition for acceleration:
Applying once again the high energy condition to the second Friedmann equation in Eq.
(16), at bounce or at
high energy, we ﬁnd that the contribution from 1/rc term is small compared to the density of the scalar ﬁeld and
consequently one ﬁnally gets the condition for acceleration as:

(cid:18) k

which clearly implies that the cosmological bounce can be obtained by violating the strong energy condition. Also, we
see that the pressure at the time of cosmological bounce is related to the scale factor and the cross over length scale rc.
• Condition for turnaround:
In order to get the condition for turnaround, we apply the condition, ρr2
4 << 1, which is valid during late
time universe, to the Friedmann equation. Then keeping terms upto the ﬁrst order, and setting H = 0, we get the

The change in the scale factor after each successive cycle is given by the following expression:

Therefore, just like in the case of bounce, where the change in the amplitude is dependent on the parameters of the
cosmological model, in such a physical prescription the change in the amplitude of the scale factor at turnaround
also depends not only on the work done, but also on the cross over length scale rc of the DGP braneworld model.
• Condition for deceleration:
Applying the late time approximation, we get the condition for deceleration as:

(ρt + 3pt) >

3M 2

(23)

Therefore, turnaround can be obtained without violating the energy condition. And just like for acceleration, here
we see that the condition for deceleration depends on rc, which was expected because in the late universe, the eﬀect
of rc will become more important.
• Evaluation of work done in one cycle:
Since the Friedmann equations in case of DGP braneworld model are highly complicated, we can use the late time and
early time approximations of the Friedmann equations in order to get an physically relevant approximate analytical
expression for the work done. Therefore, the work done can be decomposed into four parts as follows:

(cid:125)

(24)

where the ﬁrst two terms corresponds to late and early times during the period of contraction respectively and the
last two terms corresponds to early and late times during the period of expansion respectively. Here a(cid:48) corresponds

to the scale factor at the time of transition t(cid:48) from early to late time or vice-versa, amax and amin corresponds to the
values of the scale factor at the time of turnaround tmax and bounce tmin respectively. The complete expression in
terms of the model parameters has been derived in [10], from which we can ﬁnd that the evaluation of work done is
independent of the parameters of this model at early times, parameter dependence enters through late time evaluation
of the integral for work done.

In order to get exact expressions for the evolution of the scale factor and scalar ﬁeld with time, once again we need
to solve the Friedmann equations under certain limiting conditions and valid approximations. It can also be shown
that we once again get a non zero expression for the total work done in one cycle under such conditions. For more
details see [10].

Like for EHGB case, here also we have shown in Fig. 6 the evolution of scale factor and potential during expansion
and contraction phase (single cycle) for DGP model. Fig. 6 has been obtained for supergravity motivated Coleman
Weinberg potential (choosing speciﬁc values for the parameters) where the form of the potential is given by [16–20]:

where V0 sets the energy scale of supergravity inﬂation. Additionally the model parameter α signiﬁes the tree level
eﬀect and the parameter β characterizes the eﬀect of one-loop correction to the leading order result. Here M4
represents the background mass-scale of theory. For sake of simplicity one can consider M4 to be the UV cut-oﬀ i.e.
the Planck scale of the gravity theory.

Thus just like for EHGB model, here also, looking at ﬁg. 6, we can clearly say that, after the universe completes

one cycle, there is a net increase in the amplitude of the scale factor of the universe.

But we can always repeat the above analysis for any potential with proper minimum/minima. Here we have shown
the result for some chosen parameter values. For a more detailed description on the eﬀect of the parameter values
on these plots, one may refer to [10]. In [10], we repeated the above analysis for two other forms of the potential
and have found that choosing appropriate values for the model and potential parameters, we get an increase in scale
factor after one cycle.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have explored the speciﬁc role of cosmological hysteresis scenario in the context of cyclic universe
from membrane paradigm. The idea, originally proposed by the authors in refs. [5, 6], have been studied by us for
higher dimensional gravity setup like DGP and EHGB model. In [10], this study has been further extended to several
other variants of modiﬁed gravity models, minimally coupled to gravity. The most interesting outcome of this analysis
is the dependence of the bouncing and turnaround conditions on the various model parameters (speciﬁcally membrane
parameters of DGP and EHGB model in this context) of the higher dimensional gravity setup. Here it is important
to note that, only a thermodynamic interplay between the pressure and density, in the presence of a scalar ﬁeld,
succeeds in causing cosmological hysteresis scenario. Through this analysis we ﬁnd that the phenomenon of hysteresis
is very robust and is eternal for EHGB, DGP (and other) models. We study essentially those eﬀective ﬁeld theoretic
models which can give rise to both the conditions for bounce and turnaround and at the same time also satisﬁes the
observed features of the present universe. Most of the results indicate that the value of the scale factor maximum

and minimum after each cycle, depends not only on the signature of the hysteresis loop integral ((cid:72) pdV ) but also on

the relative amplitudes of the model parameters, or in other words, we can ﬁne tune the model parameters and get
an amplitude increase after each cycle even if the signature of the hysteresis loop integral is positive. While doing the
analysis we have not constrained the potential by any particular form. The potential can have any general form like
a power series, oscillatory, etc, but with well deﬁned minimum/minima which is essential for generating the required
randomness or mixing of the ﬁeld in the phase space ( ˙φ, φ) so that its value during contraction and expansion are
uncorrelated. This analysis also help us to constrain the parameters of the models and the structure of the potentials,
such that we get the required results compatible with observations.
The future prospects of our work are appended below pointwise:
• Through this analysis we have seen the beautiful correlation between purely thermodynamical principle and
relativistic models and how the former can be used for extracting interesting results from the later. But the
models that we have considered are the variants of minimally coupled gravity frameworks in extra dimensional
scenario. It would therefore be interesting to investigate what new features arises once we relax this constraint.
Also we can check whether other class of modiﬁed gravity models [21] succeeds in generating a cyclic universe
with increasing amplitude of expansion.

FIG. 6: Graphical representation of the evolution of the scale factor during the expansion and contraction phase for the DGP
model using Coleman Weinberg potential. The complete evolution of the scale factor during the expansion and contraction
phases have been obtained by dividing the evolution phases into four parts (early-late expansion phase,early-late contraction
phase).

• One would also like to ask what other observational signatures we can get from such models which can be
tested using CMB. In future we plan to connect these analyses with CMB observations, by rigorous study of
the cosmological perturbation theory in various orders of metric ﬂuctuations and computation of two point
correlations to get the expressions for scalar and tensor power spectrum in this context.

• We also carry forward our analysis in the development of density inhomogeneities, which is the prime component
to form large scale structures at late times. Also the speciﬁc role of cosmological hysteresis in the study of
cosmological perturbations i.e. for interacting/decoupled dark matter and dark energy have not been explored
at all earlier.

• Further using the reconstruction techniques [22–26] one can also study the most generic features of scalar ﬁeld

potentials in the framework of cosmological hysteresis.

• Finally, it is also possible to check whether phenomenon of hysteresis can be explained through the eﬀects of
quantum gravity- speciﬁcally string theory [27], loop quantum gravity and using torsion driven frameworks [28].
