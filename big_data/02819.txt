Doped band insulators, HfNCl, WO3, diamond, Bi2Se3, BiS2 families, STO/LAO interface, gate
doped SrTiO3 and MoS2 etc. are unusual superconductors. With an aim to build a general theory
for superconductivity in doped band insulators we focuss on BiS2 family, discovered by Mizuguchi et
al. in 2012. While maximum Tc is only ∼ 11 K in LaO1−xFxBiS2 , a number of experimental results
are puzzling and anomalous; they resemble high Tc and unconventional superconductors. Using a
two orbital model of Usui, Suzuki and Kuroki we show that the uniform low density free fermi sea in
LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 is unstable towards formation of next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi diagonal valence bond
(charge -2e Cooper pair) and their Wigner crystallization. Instability to this novel state of matter is
caused by unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsions (V ∼ 1 eV) and a hopping pattern with
sulfur mediated diagonal next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi hopping t’ ∼ 0.88 eV, larger than nearest
neighbor Bi-Bi hopping, t ∼ 0.16 eV. Wigner crystal of Cooper pairs quantum melt for doping around
x = 0.5 and stabilize certain resonating valence bond states and superconductivity. We study few
variational RVB states and suggest that BiS2 family members are latent high Tc superconductors,
but challenged by competing orders and fragile nature of manybody states sustained by unscreened
Coulomb forces. One of our superconducting state has dxy symmetry and a gap. We also predict 2d
Bose metal or vortex liquid normal state, as charge -2e valence bonds survive in the normal state.

INTRODUCTION

After the discovery of high Tc superconductivity in
cuprate family [1] in 1986, eﬀorts to synthesize new su-
perconductors have continued and is gaining momentum.
There are notable successes in these eﬀorts, even though
Tc has not surpassed the limit ∼ 134 K, set by a trilayer
cuprate at ambient pressure. It is interesting that in most
of the newly discovered low and high Tc superconduc-
tors there are strong signals for electron-electron coulomb
interaction based mechanisms for superconductivity. In
this background experimental observations of supercon-
ductivity in doped band insulators HfNCl, WO3, dia-
mond, Bi2Se3 families, STO/LAO interface, gate doped
SrTiO3, MoS2 [2–8] etc. have come as a surprise. The
BiS2 family of band insulators with low density of doped
careers, discovered in 2012 by Mizuguchi and collabora-
tors [9–13] belongs to this category. Even at optimal
Tc ≈ 11 K, only a low density of carriers ∼ 1019/cm3
get added to the two empty conduction bands. Electron-
phonon interactions should suﬃce to explain the observed
low Tc. However, various experiments seem to point that
something diﬀerent is going on.

With an ultimate aim to provide a general theory of
unusual superconductivity in a class of doped band insu-
lators [2–8], we focuss on a representative BiS2
family
in the present article. Key result of the present arti-
cle is that unscreened short range coulomb interactions
among doped carriers in this low career density system
and orbital degeneracy destabilize free fermi sea and form
charge -2e valence bonds organized as generalized Wigner
crystals. We explicitly demonstrate this instability for an
interacting model Hamiltonian for LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 , built

on a 2 orbital model [13] of Usui, Suzuki and Kuroki
(USK model). Further we show formation of certain res-
onating valence bond (RVB) states, from quantum melt-
ing of charge -2e Wigner crystal.

Wigner crystals, originally discussed for fermi sea in
a jellium background [14], contain ordered lattice of spa-
tially localized electrons. This state is possible in low car-
rier density system, when coulomb forces start to domi-
nate, as a result of reduced metallic screening. Our gener-
alized Wigner crystal is deﬁned for tight binding band in-
sulators containing relatively low density of doped carri-
ers. Depending on the system they could form i) ordered
lattice of charge -2e valence bonds or ii) ordered array
of doped Mott-Hubbard electron chains or iii) stacked 2d
electron sheets. Further it could be electrically insulat-
ing or conducting. We illustrate our proposal and theory
using BiS2 layer family as an example. Extensive exper-
imental studies that already exist in BiS2
family gives
us interesting phenomenological clues to make theoretical
progress.

In what follows, we ﬁrst discuss structure of LaOBiS2 ,
quantum chemistry and summarise the USK model [13]
for the BiS2 layers. Then we discuss in some detail ex-
perimental results that seem to be at odds with a simple
rigid band ﬁlling band picture for various properties.

Using insights from these experimental results and
physics of unscreened coulomb interaction for low car-
rier density systems, we build on the USK model, using
LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 , a case of optimal and commensurate
doping, as a reference system. We show that a large
unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion V ∼ 1
eV and a favorable hopping pattern in the conduction
band help destabilize the uniform fermi sea. Hybridiza-

tion of Bi and S orbitals in the BiS plane is such that
the sulfur mediated diagonal next nearest neighbor Bi-S-
Bi hopping t’ ∼ 0.9 ev is larger than the nearest neigh-
bor Bi-Bi hopping t ∼ 0.16 eV. Thus doped electrons
in LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 i) avoid nearest neighbor occupancy,
hence coulomb repulsion V and ii) at the same time form
a strong next nearest neighbor, diagonal Bi-S-Bi valence
bond (ﬁgure 3,4). Through suitable ordered occupancy
of 6px and 6py type Wannier orbitals and quantum ﬂuc-
tuations, the system forms generalized Wigner crystals
of valence bonds and prepares ground for unsuspected
resonating valence bond (RVB) states and superconduc-
tivity.

We simplify the model Hamiltonian of USK and
present in some detail three such lower energy states in
the neighborhood of doping x = 0.5 : I) Wigner crys-
tal of charge -2e Cooper pair (Bi-S-Bi diagonal valence
bonds), II) quantum melted Wigner crystal of plaquette
bond resonances (PBR) and III) parallel ordered array
of weakly coupled doped Mott-Hubbard chains.

We compute energy of variational states I and III ex-
actly for our model Hamiltnian, using known Hubbard
dimer solution and 1d Lieb-Wu solution. We estimate
energy of the state II, using perturbative arguments.

In state II delocalization is two dimensional and along
the Bi planes. This will be an isotropic 2d Kosterlitz
Thouless superconductor within the ab-plane. We also
show that valence bond resonance within a plaquette fa-
vor an order parameter with dxy symmetry. It is gapful
as the nodal lines pass between disconnected fermi sur-
faces.

In state III electrons delocalize along X or Y chains
and form weakly coupled doped Mott Hubbard chain
array, using the large Bi-S-Bi hopping matrix element.
For a range of doping around x = 0.5 we have doped
Mott insulating chain containing RVB supercondutiv-
ity correlations [16–18]. Anisotropic 2d uperconductivity
gets stabilized by interchain pair tunneling [19–21].
In
this picture superconductivity will be an anisotropic 2d
Kosterlitz-Thouless superconductor within the ab-plane.
At the moment we are unable to distinguish the 2d
isotropic and anisotropic superconducting states within
the accuracy of our microscopic theory. We suspect that
both types of superconductivity occur in diﬃrent family
members and at diﬀerent parts of the phase diagram, or
they could even coexist. There is also some experimental
evidence for this, as we will see.

Our phases, sustained by unscreened short range
coulomb interactions, are fragile. There are underly-
ing spontaneous breaking of rotational and translational
symmetry in the square lattice. Superconductivity and
other orders owe their existence to an organized orbital
order. In the Hubbard chain scenario, state III, normal
state is a highly anisotropic metal even within the ab-
plane, depending on the orientation of the Mott chain
arrays. Correpsondingly local superconductivity is also
anisotropic within the 2d plane. Doped 1d Mott insu-
lating chains, belonging to a class of Luttinger liquids,

2

have several intrinsic instabilities: CDW, SDW and su-
perconductivity. For a range of interaction parameters,
even p-wave superconductivity is possible. It will be in-
teresting to see if such a possibility is present for some
range of physical parameters; available experimental re-
sults [22–25] have been interpretted as providing evidence
for gapped s-wave superconducting state. In scenario II,
normal state is likely to be a 2d Cooper pair metal or
Bose metal [26], a vortex liquid [27].

Several theoretical works [29–33] provide electron-
phonon interaction based BCS mechanism for supercon-
ductivity. Other works [34–38], including the original
work of USK [13], emphasize importance of coulomb
interaction based spin ﬂuctuation mediated supercon-
ductivity and possibility of uncoventional supercon-
ducting order parameters. However, they work with
rigid band ﬁlling (an uniform state with no orbital or-
der/polarization) as a starting point and study super-
conducting instabilities arising from coulomb interaction.
Ours, on the other hand, at the very start reorganizes a
rigid band ﬁlled fermi sea into generalized Wigner crys-
tals using orbital degeneracy, and avoids a strong near-
est neighbor repulsion. We have a basic building block,
namely the Bi-S-Bi diagonal spin singlet or valence bond.
Our correlated many body state contain an optimal gain
in delocalization and correlation energy. Eﬀects of spin-
orbit coupling [39], known to be important in the heavy
Bi atom based systems, will be discussed in a later pub-
lication.

The present paper, which is based on phenomenology,
microscopic, quantum chemical and physical arguments,
is an attempt to show new possibilities in doped band in-
sulators. We suggest novel mechanism for superconduc-
tivity and certain unusual orders. Our estimates of su-
perconducting Tc’s are very crude. However, they point
towards possibility of higher Tc’s. The message is that
with suitable materials engineering in the BiS2 family, to
avoid competing charge ordered phases, one could reach
higher superconducting Tc’s. Our mehcanism of a strong
charge -2e pairing also suggests anomalous normal state
describable as Bose metal or vortex liquid [26, 27].

II. CRYSTAL AND ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE

LaOBiS2 is a representative member of the parent com-
pound of the undoped band insulating BiS2 family. LaO
layers and BiS2
layers are alternately stacked along c-
axis [9]. Electron hopping between layers along c-axis is
weak. LaO layer consists of square lattice oxygen layer
sandwitched by two La square lattice layers, such that we
get a 2d network of edge sharing La4O octahedra. This
insulating charge reservoir layer has a nominal valency
La3+O2−.

BiS2 layer consists of two layers of edge sharing square
pyramids made of 5 sulfur atoms. At the base center
of each pyramid is a Bi atoms. Bases of edge shared
pyramids form a BiS square lattice with Bi and S atoms

forming two square sublattices. Sulfur atom at the apex
of the pyramid is bonded directly to the Bi atom at the
base center. Bases of the pyramids of the two layers face
each other and form two ab-plane staggered BiS square
planes. The two BiS planes are weakely coupled electron-
ically [40].

Nominal valency of BiS2 layer is Bi3+(S2−)2. The S2−
ion has a ﬁlled shell. Bi3− ion has an electronic conﬁgura-
tion [Xe]4f145d106s2. The two lowest degenerate 6px and
6py empty orbitals of Bi, after suitable hybridization with
orbitals of the bridging sulfur atom, form the two low-
est empty conduction bands in the BiS square lattices of
the BiS2 layer. These two degenerate Wannier orbitals,
with 6px and 6py symmetry, form the basis for the 2 or-
bital tight binding model of USK [13]. Because of strong
hybridization through the S atom at the middle of ele-
mentary plaquettes of Bi atoms, the degenerate Wannier
orbitals orient and hybridize maximally along two diago-
nal direction of the square lattice (ﬁgure 1). Two oriented
orbitals with positive and negative slopes will be referred
to as X and Y orbitals respectively (ﬁgure 2).

In the tight binding parametrization of USK (ﬁgure
1), 4 important matrix elements are: t’ = 0.88 eV, t’1
= 0.094, t = -0.167 and t1 = 0.107. Matrix elements t’
and t’1 are between two next nearest neighbor Bi atoms
bridged by a S atom; t’ is between Wannier orbitals di-
rected along the diagonal direction Bi-S-Bi; t’1 is between
Wannier orbitals directed perpendicular to the diagonal
direction Bi-S-Bi. Matrix elements t and t1 are between
two nearest neighbor Bi atoms with orbitals parallel or
mutually perpendicular to each other.

As discussed in detail in references [13], if we keep only
the largest diagonal hopping term, t’ ≈ 0.88 and ignore
the rest, rigid band ﬁlling scenario becomes simple. Free
part of the Hamiltonian in this case describes a collection
of disconnected tight binding electronic chains running
along the two diagonal directions [13, 41]. We call them
X and Y chains (ﬁgure 2). In the X-chain electrons hop
between next nearest neighbor 6px orbitals with a matrix
element t’. Similary for the y-chains. Enery dispersion

relation for X and Y chains are

ǫX(kx, ky) = 2t′ cos(kx + ky)
ǫY (kx, ky) = 2t′ cos(kx − ky)

3

(1)
(2)

Band ﬁlling in this limit is simple and featureless. How-
ever, incorporation of t, t1 and t’1, the interchain hop-
ping parameters, modify dispersion relations, resulting
in a well discussed topological change in fermi surface
shape as one goes through a van Hove singularity as x is
increased from 0.0 to 0.5. It should be pointed out that
topological phase transition generated by the weak inter-
chain hopping occur only at small fermi energies, where a
signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the fermi sea, from the strong
unscreened coulomb interactions, is expected.

Two of the largest coulomb interaction parameters,
which have been considered by other authors as well
[13, 34–38], will play important role in our theory. They
are the onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor repul-
sion V. We approximate the inter and intra orbital two
electron repulsion at a given site by a single U ∼ 2 eV.
Similary we assume a single V ∼ 1 eV, for two electron
repulsion between nearest neighbor sites, independent of
the orbitals they occupy.

Another important oﬀ-diagonal two body Coulomb
term represented by Jp ≈ V
4 ∼ 0.25 eV, rotates a di-
agonal spin singlet pair (ﬁgure 5) in an elementary Bi
plaquette, by an angle π
2 . An inter orbital Hund cou-
pling at a given Bi site can be ignored, as proabability of
such occupancies are very low in our low carrier density
systems.

Larger value of U and V has been suggested in the
literature. We ﬁnd that even with our conservative values
of U and V, rich physics emerge.

Having gotten an idea about the electronic structure
we will move on to a summary of the puzzling phe-
nomenology. It guides us to build a model and suggest
physics beyond rigid band ﬁlling.

III. PUZZLING EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section we brieﬂy summarise experimental re-
sults and point out certain puzzling aspects. We begin
with ARPES [42–46]. For low doping, one sees small
Fermi pockets, as predicted by theory. However the pock-
ets do not close and resemble Fermi arcs seen in under-
doped high Tc superconductors. Further some experi-
ments ﬁnd that volume of the fermi pockets do not agree
with doping density x, indicating a possible failure of Lut-
tinger theorem. Quasi particle width, as given by ARPES
are very broad, with widths comparable to underdoped
cuprates.

A recent ARPES study [45] brings out orbital poariza-
tion content in diﬀerent parts of the BZ. This has been
interpreted to mean that underlying Bloch states of the
fermi sea have diﬀerent orbital content, due to a strong
1d character of the band. We suggest that this data is

not inconsisent with real space domains containing or-
dered doped Mott-Hubbard electronic chains (domains
of generalized Wigner crystal). This interpretation has
some support from STM results that we will see shortly.
ARPES also sees [44], as doping is changed, an indica-
tion for change in fermi surface topology, as in a rigid
band ﬁlling scenario. However, spectral functions are
very broad. We interpret the seen topology change as
an interesting, but residual feature of a strongly aﬀected
reference fermi sea, rather than signal for a fermi liquid.
Similar situation arises in cuprates, where even in the
Mott insulator and lightly doped Mott insulator one sees
residual features of a strongly aﬀected non interacting
fermi surface. Fermi liquid, as we know in metals for
example, has a sharp feature with quasi particle width
vanishing as T2 at low temperatures. Electron-phonon
interaction, important in these low carrier density ma-
terial, could explain the broad spectral features through
polaronic eﬀect. However it is diﬃcult to explain other
features, as in the case of cuprates.

In a soft Xray photo emission study [47] a strong sup-
poression of the fermi edge is seen in a BiS2
family
member. The authors bring out an interesting similir-
ity of this suppression to that seen in strongly correlated
systems such as cuprates.

STM studies [48–50] for diﬀerent family members exist.
A recent observation [48] of strong local orbital ordering
and checker board pattern of such local orders is very
interesting. Caution has been made that this could be a
surface eﬀect, rather than a bulk phenomenon. However,
such a behavior in the bulk, is consistent with our gen-
eralized Wigner crystallization supported array of doped
Mott-Hubbard chains and/or ordered plaquette valence
bond resonances.

Giant superconducting ﬂuctuations, resembling pseudo
gap of cuprates have been also reported. In one of the
STM studies [49], what is believed to be a superconduct-
ing gap does not close well above Tc, reminescent of un-
derdoped cuprates. A large variation in the supercon-
ducting gaps seen [50]in one experiment is also remines-
cent of underdoped cuprates. It is also noteworthy that
2∆
a large value
kB T c ≈ 16 seen in some experiments [49] is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from weak coupling BCS expecta-
tions.

Tunneling asymetry has been argued to be an im-
portant consequence of an underlying Mott character
in doped Mott insulating system [51]. The work re-
ported in reference [48], clearly shows a marked tunneling
asymetry. We interpret this as signal for presence of self
organized doped Mott insulator character.

Neutron scattering results [53, 54] show presence of
strong local structural (pyramid) distortions. The re-
sults remind one of large octahedral rotations and local
distortions in CuO2 planes seen in single layer cuprate
material such as LSCO or 2201 BISCO, where the super-
conducting Tc is considerbly low. These local distortion
or rotations help charge localization and favor compet-
ing orders such as charge stripes, spin stripes etc., at the

4

expense of superconducting order [55, 56].

In one of the BiS2 family members, a signal for CDW
transition [52] around 250 K is reported. It will be in-
teresting to see if this is connected to our proposal of
generalized Wigner crystallization that supports super-
conducting RVB states at low temperatures.

Controlled study [57, 58] has been performed in
Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 as a function of doping x. There is a
good indication of a ﬁrst order insulator to superconduc-
tor, as a function of x. In our opinion this points out that
charges in the insulating phase (below the critical x) are
organized in special ways (Cooper pair Wigner crystals or
self trapped valence bonds from a strong electron-phonon
interactions) that enable a ﬁrst order transition to a su-
perconducting state. Detailed STM and ARPES study
in these systems are required.

Hydrostatic pressure and uniaxial pressure experi-
ments [59–63] also show ﬁrst order phase transition, be-
tween two superconducting states having diﬀerent Tc’s.
We suggest that they represent transition between two
diﬀerent self organized RVB phases supported by diﬀer-
ent patterns of generalized Wigner crystallization.

Optical conductivity [64] in one of the BiS2

systems
exhibit an upper Hubbard band like maxima centered
around 1.5 eV. This interesting feature, according to
our interpretation to be discussed later, provides an evi-
dence for presence of strong Bi-S-Bi valence bonds in the
ground state.

With this background in mind we will discuss our
model and show that coulomb interaction can organize
conduction electrons in special ways and give rise to an
electron correlation based superconductivity.

INSTABILITY OF THE UNIFORM FERMI

SEA TOWARDS COOPER PAIR WIGNER

CRYSTAL FORMATION

In this section we start with the 2 band model of USK
and show that even a conservative value of coulomb inter-
action parameters encourage orbital order and modiﬁes
physics in an interesting way. The commensurate doping
x = 0.5, in LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 oﬀers us a convenient place
to illustrate importance of coulomb interactions and our
generalization Wigner crystallization of charge -2e va-
lence bonds. First we estimate the total energy per site
in the rigid band ﬂlled scenario. Then we construct few
RVB states with lower energies.

We consider the many chain Hamiltonian Hc for a sin-
gle Bi square lattice.
It contains two parts: X and Y
chain hopping terms and onsite and nearest and neigh-
boring coulomb interactions U and V. To begin with we
ignore interchain hopping terms t’1, t and t1, as they are
small compared to the largest t’. Their important eﬀects
will be studied latter. The many chain model hamilto-

where ni ≡ Pσ(niXσ + niY σ) is the total number of

wave functions and compute their energy exactly for the
many chain model Hamiltonian Hc (equation 3). This
will help us to show an instability of the uniform free
fermi sea. At the ﬁlling x = 0.5 under consideration,
mean number of electron added per site is 1

This uniform state has full orbital and lattice symmetry.
Band width of the 1d chains is 4t’. Kinetic energy per

in a single site and the second term is the number of two

Inclusion of interchain and other hopping matrix ele-
ments do not produce appreciable correction to the vari-
ational energy. We observe that major energy increase in
this low density system comes from the nearest neighbor
repulsion V.

Let us consider a classical electron crystal state, which
avoids coulomb repulsion U and V completely (for x =
0.5), through single electron occupancy of one of the sub-
lattices of Bi square lattice and zero occupancy in the
other (ﬁgure 3). This crystalline state of electrons is
highly degenerate. The 4 N
fold degeneracy arises from
the two fold orbital and two fold spin degeneracy.

We will remove degeneracy of the above classical
ground state step by step, to see the emergence and im-
portance of the diagonal Bi-S-Bi valence bond.
In the
ﬁrst step we form charge -2e Cooper pairs or valence
bonds as shown in ﬁgure 4. It is a Wigner lattice of or-
dered and frozen diagonal valence bonds, where no two
electrons are nearest neighbors.

We calculate energy of a Bi-S-Bi diagonal valence bond
(charge -2e state) using the ground state energy of a two
site Hubbard model (Hubbard dimer)

FIG. 4: A Wigner crystal of charge -2e valence bonds for
LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 , with commensurate doping x = 0.5. Inspite
of valence bond localization its energy is lower than the free

nearest neighbor repulsion V.

term is the Hartree term, coming from onsite repulsion
U. Third term is the important correlation energy gain,
that arises through a supression of double occupancy in
the exact solution of the Hubbard dimer. This bonding
between next nearest neighbor Bi sites (along diagonal
Bi-S-Si direction) avoids nearest neighbor repulsion V.

Thus energy per Bi site of the frozen charge -2e Wigner

crystal state is given by

Evbc =

1
4

Evb ≈ −0.3eV

(7)

This energy is lower than the energy of the uniform
shallow fermi sea state (equation 5), for our model Hamil-
tonian (equation 3). This completes our proof for the in-
stability of uniform fermi sea towards charge -2e Cooper
pair formation and Wigner crystallization.

In proving an instability we have used a key nearest
neighbor repulsion energy parameter V ∼ 1 eV. An ac-
curate and microscopic evaluation of this parameter, rel-
evant for low energy physics in BiS2 layers, as a function
of doping x, in itself is a challenging manybody problem.
Our parameter V, in some senses encodes all (non on-
site) short distance unscreened electron-electron coulomb
repulsions.

Eﬀective value of V for a given family member will
depend on crystal and electronic structures, nature and
dielectric properties of the reservoir layer etc. A large
value of V we have assued is reasonable in an insulating
state, such as a Wigner crystal we have discussed. Once
the system gets metallized eﬀective V will be modiﬁed.
We believe that modiﬁcations at short distances will not
be signiﬁcant enough to alter our picture.

Our main message is that in a low carrier density
fermi sea unscreened short range repulsions can not be
ignored, an insight that Wigner provided us back in 1934.
In tight binding models with orbital degeneracies un-
screened coulomb interaction seems to be even more im-
portant and has a potential to provide a rich physics,
through self organization of generalized Wigner crystal,
RVB states etc.

V. QUANTUM MELTING OF COOPER PAIR

WIGNER CRYSTAL AND
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

Having demonstrated an instability of the uniform
fermi sea to Wigner crystal formation, we study quan-
tum ﬂuctuations in the Cooper pair Wigner crystal. A
given valence bond can undergo diﬀerent quantum ﬂuctu-
ations, by electron hopping to available empty degenerate
orbitals. Using the diagonal hopping t’ a given X or Y-
valence bond can i) expand its size by one diagonal unit
in the diagonal (forward or backward) direction and ii)
(pair) hop in the diagonal (forward or backward) direc-
tion by one unit. Our estimate of energy gain from these
processes is - t′
8 . Further, an X valence bond can quan-
tum tunnel to become a Y valence bond (a π
2 rotation)
using an oﬀ diagonal two body coulomb matrix element
Jp, taking advantage of non-zero overlap charges between
the X and Y σ bonding orbitals. Energy gain from this
plaquette resonance (with dxy orbital symmetry, ﬁgure
5) per site is - Jp
4 . Since overlap charges are localized
to the neigborhood of sulfur atoms, our estimate of Jp is
∼ V
4 .
In the above processes we also create virtual nearest
neighbor occupancies. An estimate of coulomb energy
cost per site from the above is V
8 . Thus total energy gain
from quantum ﬂuctuations in the Cooper pair Wigner
crystal state per Bi site is

−

∼ 0.06 eV.

(8)

According to this estimate, a stable phase for the com-
mensurate doping x = 0.5 is a Wigner crystal of plaqauete
resonance bonds, or a Wigner crystal of charge -2e
Cooper pairs, shown in ﬁgure 5.
It is also interesting
to note the sign diﬀerence between the X and Y valence
bonds, arising from a positive Jp (pair hlpping between
X and Y chains) indicates a dxy type of order parameter
symmetry for superconductivity in this scenario.

Additional quantum ﬂuctuations might melt

the
charge -2e Cooper pair Wigner crystal even at the com-
mensurate ﬁlling x = 0.5. In existing experimental results
for Tc as a function of x there is no dip seen around x
= 0.5. This could indicate that the Cooper pair Wigner
crystal has quantum melted and become a superconduc-
tor, even at x = 0.5.

As we move away from x = 0.5 we loose commensu-
rability and Wigner crystal will quantum melt. Cooper
pairs will also delocalize and expand their sizes, to take
advantage of single particle delocalization. However, we
expect the nature of valence bond correlations to survive
at short distances even after quantum melting. That is,
quantum melted Cooper pair ﬂuid is a strongly correlated
charge -2e ﬂuid that avaoids nearest neighbor coulomb re-
pulsions. This as an interacting charge -2e bose ﬂuid, a
Kosterlitz-Thouless superconductor. Scale of supercon-
ducting Tc is determined by the eﬀective band width of
the delocalized charge -2e valence bond. An unscreened

FIG. 5: Stating from state shown in ﬁgure 4, we allow for
2 rotational pair
Bi-S-Bi diagonal valence bond to undergo π
tunneling within the plaquettes to form an ordered plaque-
tte bond resonance with dxy symmetry. This Wigner crys-
talline state of charge -2e plaquette bond resonance gains a
little more energy than charge -2e valence bond Wigner crys-
tal state (ﬁgure 4).

near neighbor coulomb repulsions, the two fold orbital
degeneracy and geometry of chemical bonding in the BiS
lattice has stabilized this phase.

Inview of the positive matrix element for hopping of va-
lence bond between X and Y chains, as mentioned earlier
we expect dxy symmetry for the spin singlet Cooper pair
order parameter. This is likely to be a gapful dxy state as
fermi surfaces are fragmented. as seen in ARPES exper-
iments [42–46]. That is, nodal lines pass between fermi
surfaces.

We estimate the eﬀective band width of the valence
bond pair using perturbation theory argument. An el-
ementary valence bond pair motion involves single elec-
tron hopping, twice.
In the intermediate state valence
bond is broken. Perturbation theory estimate for valnce
bond pair hopping is tvb ≈
∼ 0.7 eV .

t′2

This is indeed a large energy scale. However, short range
coulomb repulsion in this dense ﬂuid of valence bond
will renormalize the hopping matrix element signiﬁcantly
downwards and make Cooper pairs heavy. Further, fu-
sion and regroupling of valence bonds through collisons
will make the simple Bose ﬂuid picture less and less rel-
evant as we move away from the doping x = 0.5. This
brings in exponential supression factor, similar to BCS
and RVB mean ﬁeld theories [17], giving us the following
expression for Tc:

Here Jeﬀ is a mean energy required to break spin sin-
glet pair and creat two electrons at the fermi level, for a
short time scale. The exponential factor indicates a BCS
like condensation of spin singlet spinon pairs, similiar to
the situation in RVB mean ﬁeld theory for cuprates [17].
ρ(ǫF) is the density of states at the reference uniform

fermi sea. When U
is large Jeﬀ is approximated by the
t
superexchange J ≈ 4t2

of intermediate U
t , energy diﬀerence between the singlet
ground state and excited triplet state of a Hubbard dimer
is a good measure of Jeﬀ ≈ 1

This rough estimate gives us a maximum scale of Tc

in the range 20 to 100 K.

A good way to study ground state properties of super-
conductivity quantitatively is to use the following varia-
tional RVB wave function:

|P RBiSC = Pp(Xij

φij b†

ij)

Ne
2 |0i.

(10)

The function φij represents Cooper pair function for
a singlet valence bond electron pair at sites i and j.
In terms of relative coordinates, amplitude φij is large
within a plaquette for diagonal singlets. A coherent su-
perposition of diagonal singlets, within a plaquette rep-
resents the plaquette valence bond resonance with dxy
symmetry. The projection Pp prevents overlap or touch-
ing of resonating plaquettes. This takes care of the short
range coulomb repulsion and inturn overlap of valence
bonds.

We defer study of the above variational wave function
to a future publication and just point out that the short
range repulsions in the BiS lattice, orbital degeneracy
and a favorable hopping path way has given us an op-
portunity to have stable charge -2e Cooper pairs and a
means to achieve superconductivity.

In the next section we will see another nearly degen-
erate supercondducting state that can be obtained by
creating quantum ﬂuctuations in a charge -2e Wigner
crystal.

VI. TRANSFORMATION OF 2D COOPER PAIR

WIGNER CRYSTAL INTO 1D ARRAY OF

DOPED MOTT-HUBBARD CHAINS

The superconducting and normal state that we are go-
ing to construct is interesting in its own right and has
some phenomenological support as we will see. To re-
alize this variational state we allow electrons to delocal-
ize along only X chains, using hopping t’, as shown in
ﬁgure 6. This results in decoupled 1d chains, whose ef-
fective Hamiltonian within this manifold of X-orbital oc-
cupancy are decoupled 1d Hubbard X-chains. We start
with a variational state denoted as (... , 1
2 , 0, ...)
to indicate a collection of parallel chains in their ground
state with a staggered occupancy of 1
2 and 0. As nearest
neighbor occupancies are absent in this variational state,
inspite of delocalization along the chains, nearest neigh-
bor repulsion V term drops out in the energy estimate.
Energy of the above state at half ﬁlling is obtained

malization of hopping matrix element, as a function of

same value of x = 0.5, our correlated manybody state
has a lower energy of ∼ − 0.1 eV per site.

2 − ǫ, ǫ , 1

2 − ǫ, ǫ , 1

We also ﬁnd that we can reduce energy of the above
state further (ﬁgure 5), by a staggered chain occupancy
(..., 1
2 − ǫ, ...), where the variational
parameter ǫ ≤ 0.25. This state is a self doped state,
where Mott insulating chains have transferred a fraction
ǫ of electrons to empty chains. We will discuss optimal
value of ǫ etc., in a future publication, except to point
out that for ǫ = 0.25 we have series of weakly coupled
quarter ﬁlled bands, where only rotational symmetry is
broken and lattice translation symmetry is preserved.

The above intrinsically anisotropic reference varia-
tional state allows us to construction anomalous normal
states and superconducting states by making use of in-
terchain hopping that we have ignored so far.

Mott insulating subsystes that we mostly encounter,
for example in CuO or LaMnO3 are robust Mott insula-
tors. Mott insulating 3d electrons are robust organiza-
tions through strong chemical bonding of various atoms
and after removal of orbital degeneracies. They are sup-
ported by the underlying lattice and a set of atoms.

In our case of generalized Wigner crystals, orbital
selection and orbital order self organizes and supports

8

doped Mott insulating chains with reduced symmetries.
Doped Mott-Hubbard chain arrays breaks rotational and
translational symmetry of the square lattice. There are
2×2 = 4 possible chain orders: they are obtained by glob-
ally i) replacing x chains by y chains and ii) interchanging
empty band chains and half ﬁlled band chains.

This leads to 4 diﬀerent types of domain formation and
accompanying phase boundaries, which are topological
defects. Under suitable conditions these domains could
order. Domain formation can be encouraged by disorder,
for example arising from positional disorder of F atoms
in LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 .

Energy gain in our low carrier density system by for-
mation of doped Mott insulating state is small ∼ 0.1 eV.
The self organized Mott chains can also disappear as a
function of temperature, for entropic reasons. This will
be a thermal melting of a generalized Wigner crystalline
state.

VII.

INTERCHAIN PAIR TUNNELING AND

ANISOTROPIC 2D RVB SUPERCONDUCTIVITY

We will sketch the mechanism of superconductivity in
the weakly coupled doped Mott insulating chain scenario
and make an estimate of superconducting Tc. Mott in-
sulating chains develop a strong local spin singlet pairing
correlations, as we move away from half ﬁlling. This
is known in theory, from Lieb-Wu solution and numeri-
cal studies. Using the RVB theory for cuprates [16–18],
we suggest that neutral spin singlet pairs in the Mott-
Hubbard chains are pre-existing Cooper pairs. In view of
a ﬁnite Mott-Hubbard gap, singlet spinon pairs present in
the ground state are not capable of transporting charges
and remain neutral. Doping makes room for a fraction
of electron singlets to coherently delocalize and trans-
port charge -2e. Fraction of charges that are capable of
transporting charge -2e, the superﬂuid fraction, is pro-
portional to the variational parameter ǫ (amount of self
doping) or doping, δ ≡ 0.5 - x.

A doped Mott-Hubbard chain can not support true
long range superconducting order, due to divergent 1d
ﬂuctuatuions. The interchain hopping can help in estab-
lishing a 2d Kosterlitz Thouless state. This is closely
related to the interlayer pair tunneling [19] and inter-
chain pair tunneling [20] mechanism of superconductiv-
ity, which we brieﬂy describe below.

A doped Mott-Hubbard chain, at low energies has spin-
charge decoupling.
It is described by Luttinger liquid
theory. Coherent electron quasi particles are absent at
the fermi surface. Consequently interchain hopping ma-
trix elements get renormalized to zero at low energies
[21]. It means that two conducting chains are eﬀectively
insulated and single electrons are conﬁned within the
chains. This is a many body eﬀect, that was discussed
in detail early in the context of interlayer pair tunneling
mechanism in cuprates [19–21]. However, if we consider a
second order process, involving tunneling of pair of elec-

trons, there can be coherent transport of a spin singlet
charge 2e pair, using strong pairing correlations present
in the individual chains.

This coherent transport of charge 2e spin singlet pairs
from chain to chain acts like a local Josephson tunneling.
What is important is that energy gain from Josephson
tunneling can i) increase local superconducting correla-
tion and ii) establish Kosterlitz-Thouless superconductiv-
ity in 2 dimensions. In establishing a 2d superconductiv-
ity RVB superconducting correlations in the doped Mott
chains play a fundamental role.

chain pair tunneling tunneling mechanism involves the

(13)

Here Jeﬀ is a mean energy required to break spin singlet
pair and creat two electrons at the fermi level, for a short
time scale, so that they can pair tunnel via a second order
process involving interchain hopping matrix element t”
etc. Meaning of the BCS like dependence is similar to the
one we discussed in section V (following equation 9), for
the isotropic 2d superconductivity. Substituting suitable
numbers we get an estimate for maximum scale of Tc in
the range ∼ 2 to 20 K. This scale of Tc is much lower
than the isotropic 2d state that we discussed in section
V.

A well known place, where interchain pair tunneling
seems to be at work,
is in quasi 1d organic conduc-
tors [65]. Scale of interchain tunneling is typically 10
to 20 times lower.
Interchain pair tunnelling has been
also suggested [20] to be a mechanism for pairing, when
weakly coupled charge stripes are present in underdoped
cuprates.

9

A very neat upper Hubbard band like feature is seen in
optical conductivity around the energy 1.5 eV reported
in [64]. We suggest that this is a signal for the presence of
Bi-S-Bi singlet pairs in the ground state. Energy required
to break a valence bond pair in our theory (equation 6)
is Evb ≈∼ 1.2 eV. Inclusion of residual coulomb inter-
actions within our scenario could account for the peak
seen at an energy of 1.5 eV in optical conductivity. More
experiments will be welcome.

In the pseudo gap phase of cuprates pairing correla-
tions or pre-existing RVB singlet pairs survive well above
Tc. In such a situation electrical transport, their mag-
netic ﬁeld dependence and properties such as Nernst ef-
fect are dominated by Cooper pairs present at the fermi
level and population of thermal vortices in the 2d CuO2
planes. Anderson calls this phase as a vortex liquid [27].
In another context, namely superconductor to insulator
transition in 2d, for example induced by changing disor-
der, an intermediate metallic state domonated by Cooper
pair like Bose correlations has been suggested. This is
called Bose metal [26] by Das and Doniach. In our opin-
ion there is a close connection between Bose metal and
vortex liquid [28].

The theory we have developed in this paper for
BiS2 oﬀers a new play ground to achieve the physics of
Bose metal and vortex liquid. In our model, pairing cor-
relation arising from avoidance of next nearest neighbor
repulsions, favors strong valence bond correlations with
a large energy scale. This bosonic charge -2e correlation
should survive in the normal state. Our suggestion is
that the normal state of BiS2 family of superconductors
should be studied carefully from the view of Bose metal
and anomalous Nernst eﬀect.

In general the pseudogap features seen so for in various
experiments should be investigated further to get deeper
insight into the fascinating BiS2 family.

VIII. TUNNLING ASYMMETRY, OPTICAL

CONDUCTIVITY, BOSE METAL AND VORTEX

LIQUID

Asymmetry in the tunneling conductance feature has
been suggesed to be an important signal of an under-
lying Mott character in doped Mott insulating system
[51]. Physically this asymmetry arises from diﬀerences in
many electron reorganization, while adding or removing
an electron in an STM experiment for example. The ex-
perimental work reported in reference [48], clearly shows
a marked tunneling asymetry.
In our theory, in Mott-
Hubbard chain scenario as well as valence bond Wigner
crystal scenario, we have strongly correlated Mott chain
or Hubbard dimer which could produce the required
asymmetry [66] in tunneling conductance.

It will be nice to repeat the tunneling measurement
for various doping level and study the asymmetry. Our
expectation is that the asymmetry will be stronger at
lower doping.

IX. DISCUSSION AND SOME PREDICTIONS

What is novel in our work is the organization of a di-
lute fermi sea in a band insulator, into states containing
certain diagonal valence bonds (charge -2e Cooper pairs).
These states range from Cooper pair Wigner crystal to
weakly coupled array of 1d Mott-Hubbard chains. The
family of states we have suggested could support isotropic
as well as anisotropic 2d Kosterlitz-Thouless supercon-
ductivity. It is likely both occur in diﬀerent members of
the BiS2 family for diﬀerent range of parameters.

Self organization we have suggested,

interestingly,
makes onsite coulomb repulsion important, while try-
ing to avoid near neighbor coulomb repulsions.
It is a
delicate interplay between onsite interaction and resid-
ual long range coulomb interactions, that leads to doped
Mott physics and superconductivity.

In the Cooper pair Wigner crystal phase we have pro-
posed, a disorder free LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 is likely to be an
insulator.
In an ideal situation deviation away from x

= 0.5 will act like a doping parameter. Disorder could
quantum melt and create superconductivity even for x =
0.5. It will be interesting to see if the superconducting
dome, currently observed around x = 0.5, develops a dip
around x = 0.5 in superconducting Tc as a function of x,
with decrease in disorder.

Diagonal valence bond singlets Bi-S-Bi play a funda-
mental role in our theory. Topological defects in the gen-
eralized Wigner crystal may contain a ﬁnite density of
unpaired spins (spinons) through broken diagonal valence
bonds. This may lead to low temperature Curie contri-
bution to spin susceptibility.

In the present paper we have only focussed on cer-
tain simple energy minimizing generalized Wigner crystal
states. A closer look suggests that a variety of ordering
of diagonal singlets, with closeby energies are possible.
One also expects glass like organization of the diagonal
singlets for some range of parameters, leading to inter-
esting electron pair glass or valence bond glass phases.
As we indicated earlier, in the Mott-Hubbard chain sce-
nario p-wave instability nematic metallic state etc. are
interesting possibilities.

Self organized states we have presented in this paper
could be easily aﬀected by disorder and temperature. So
we expect interesting phase transitions as a function of
temperature and disorder. As there is a spontaneous
translation and orientational symmetry breaking associ-
ated with the self organization interesting topological de-
fects, induced charges are possible. To test our theory it
will be interesting to look for signals for enhanced anti-
ferromagnetic (spin singlet) correlations in neutron and
NMR experiments.

Electronic coupling between two Bi-S layers in the
BiS2 bilayers [40], in our theory, could play important
role in stabilizing diﬀerent generalized Wigner crystals
and their quantum melting properties. This needs to be
investigated.

Instability towards the two phases we have talked
about can also be justiﬁed using a weak coupling ap-
proach and a proper use of Umklapp electron pair scat-
tering. They help build Mott localized spin singlet pairs
[66].

Our self organized Wigner crystal that supports doped
Mott Hubbard chains or sheets is diﬀerent from the
stripes one sees in underdoped cuprates and other Mott
insulator based systems [67]. We organize strongly corre-
lated systems starting from a fermi sea in a doped band
insulator. Whereas stripe states in cuprates are reorga-
nizations of an underlying Mott insulator after doping.

Electron phonon interaction will play very important
role for small value of x. It is likely to stabilize isolated
or islands, or even ordered arrays of Bi-S-Bi diagonal va-
lence bonds. In the superconducting state, where valence
bonds are delocalized, it is likely to play less important
role.

10

We hope to presemt, in a future publication, a gen-
eral theory of RVB states in doped band insulators from
Coulomb forces and apply to other systems [2–8], HfNCl,
WO3, diamond, Bi2Se3 families, STO/LAO interface,
gate doped SrTiO3, MoS2 etc., alluded to at the begin-
ning.

X. SUMMARY

In this article we discussed the puzzling phenomenol-
ogy of the BiS2
layered family of superconductors and
have suggest that they point towards a mechanism of
superconductivity that is based on electron-electron re-
pulsion. Our main point is that utilizing the two fold
orbital degeneracy at the fermi level and unscreened near-
est neighbor coulomb repulsion, doped electrons get self
organized into arrays of doped Mott chains or a quan-
tum liquid or isotropic 2d RVB staates. We have called
them Wigner crystal supported RVB states.
Super-
conductivity, within our theory, can be either isotropic
2d or anisotropic 2d Kosterlitz-Thouless state.
In the
isotropic (melted Wigner crystal) scenario order parame-
ter symmetry is a gapful dxy symmetry; in the anisotropic
(doped Mott Hubbard chain array) scenario we have a
gapful extended-S symmetry.

We made an accurate estimate of energy of the vatia-
tional state, using known exact results from Lieb and Wu
for 1d repulsive Hubbard model. Rest of the conclusions,
including a possible second phase containing plaquette
bond resonances logically follow from this starting point.
Our work at the moment is semi quantitative and sug-
gestive. It needs to be addressed more quantitatively.

The novel scenario and a theory we have presented,
that emphasizes importance of unscreened coulomb in-
teractions in doped band insulators, is encouraging from
the point of reaching higher superconducting Tc’s in this
s-p, non transition metal based system. We hope it will
raise debates, initiate further work and be of assistance
to experimentalists to engineer synthesize of new mem-
bers of the family, having reduced competing orders and
higher superconducting Tc.

Patnaik and S. Arumugam for discussion of their work. I
am grateful to Science and Engineering Research Board
(SERB, India) for a Fellowship. This work, partly per-
formed at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics,
Waterloo, Canada is supported by the Government of
Canada through Industry Canada and by the Province
of Ontario through the Ministry of Research and Innova-
tion.
