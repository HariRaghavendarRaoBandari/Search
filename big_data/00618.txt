SUNG RAK CHOI, JINHYUNG PARK, AND JOONYEONG WON

Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the close relation between Okounkov
bodies and Zariski decompositions of pseudoeﬀective divisors on smooth projective surfaces.
Firstly, we completely determine the limiting Okounkov bodies on such surfaces, and give ap-
plications to Nakayama constants and Seshadri constants. Secondly, we study how the shapes
of Okounkov bodies change as we vary the divisors in the big cone.

1. Introduction

To a big divisor D on a variety, one can associate a convex body ∆Y•(D) with respect to an
admissible ﬂag Y• called the Okounkov body. Inspired by the works of Okounkov in [O1], [O2],
Lazarsfeld-Mustat¸˘a ([LM]) and Kaveh-Khovanskii ([KK]) initiated the systematic study of the
Okounkov bodies of big divisors. In [CHPW], two natural ways to associate convex bodies to a
pseudoeﬀective divisor D with respect to an admissible ﬂag Y• were introduced. They are called
the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim
Y• (D). It was proved
that some of the fundamental properties of divisors are encoded in these convex bodies. We
refer to Section 3 for the deﬁnitions and basic properties of the Okounkov bodies.

Y• (D) and the valuative Okounkov body ∆val

The study on Okounkov bodies follows a simple philosophy that the structure of the Ok-
ounkov bodies should tell us the information of the divisors. Thus determining the shapes of the
Okounkov bodies is an important task. Even in the surface case, there are still many questions
that await to be answered.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we completely determine the limiting and valua-
tive Okounkov bodies of pseudoeﬀective divisors with respect to an arbitrary admissible ﬂag on
surfaces using the Zariski decompositions. As consequences, we show that the geometric prop-
erties of the given divisor and the admissible ﬂag are reﬂected in the Okounkov bodies. Then,
we try to ﬁnd a chamber decomposition of the big cone such that the shape of the Okounkov
bodies associated to the divisors in each chamber is constant.

Throughout the paper, by a surface S, we mean a smooth projective surface deﬁned over an
algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero. When D is a big divisor on a surface, [KLM,
Theorem B] completely characterize the Okounkov body of D. Our ﬁrst main result is an
extension of [KLM, Theorem B] to the pseudoeﬀective case.

Theorem 1.1 (=Theorem 4.12 and Theorem 4.15). Let D be a non-big pseudoeﬀective divisor
on a smooth projective surface S, and D = P +N be the Zariski decomposition. Fix an admissible
ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S. Then

(2) Suppose that P.C = 0. Let µ := µ(D; C) be the Nakayama constant of D along C. If

In particular, if D is a Q-divisor, then the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim
C• (D) is a line segment in
R2
≥0 with a nonnegative rational slope with rational end points. Conversely, for any nonnegative
rational number r ∈ Q≥0, there exists a smooth projective surface S, a pseudoeﬀective Q-divisor
D on S, and an admissible ﬂag C• such that the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim
C• (D) has a slope r.

All the necessary notions are recalled in Sections 2, 3, and 4. To prove Theorem 1.1, we
study basic properties of Nakayama constants, Zariski decompositions, and asymptotic base loci
in Section 4. Note that all the cases in Theorem 1.1 do occur (see Example 4.14). As appli-
cations, we determine the inﬁnitesimal limiting Okounkov body (Corollary 4.18), and compute
the Seshadri constant via the Okounkov body (Theorem 4.19).

We also study an analogous statement to Theorem 1.1 for the valuative Okounkov body
C• (D) of an eﬀective divisor D with respect to any admissible ﬂag C• on a surface S (see

∆val
Theorem 4.17).

Next, we study how the shapes of Okounkov bodies change as we vary the divisors in the big

cone. The following is the second main result of this paper.

Theorem 1.2 (=Theorem 5.4). Let S be a smooth projective surface such that the pseudoeﬀec-
tive cone Eﬀ(S) is rational polyhedral. Let {Di|i ∈ I} be a ﬁnite set of big divisors contained in
a ﬁxed stability chamber SC. Then there exits an admissible ﬂag C• such that ∆C•(Di) for all
i ∈ I are similar i.e., all ∆C• (Di) have the same shape.

See Section 2 for the brief review on the decomposition of Big(S) into the stability chambers
SC and Section 5 for basic deﬁnitions of convex geometry. We remark that one cannot say that
for all admissible ﬂag, the Okounkov bodies of ﬁnitely many big divisors in a ﬁxed stability
chambers have the same shape (see Example 5.6).

The paper is organized as follows. We start in Section 2 by recalling basic notions and
properties of divisors. Section 3 reviews the construction of the Okounkov body as in [LM]
and [KK], and presents the main results of [CHPW] on the limiting and valuative Okounkov
bodies. In Section 4, we show Theorem 1.1 and give some applications to Nakayama constants
and Seshadri constants. Section 5 is devoted to proving Theorem 1.2.

2. Preliminaries

Throughout the paper, S denotes a smooth projective surface deﬁned over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero and D denotes a pseudoeﬀective R-divisor on S unless otherwise
stated. In this section, we brieﬂy recall basic notions and properties which we need later on.

2.1. Asymptotic base locus. When D is a Q-divisor, we deﬁne the stable base locus of D as

SB(D) :=\m

Bs(mD)

B+(D) :=\A
B−(D) :=[A

SB(D − A)

SB(D + A)

where the intersection is taken over all positive integers m such that mD are Z-divisors, and
Bs(mD) denotes the base locus of the linear system |mD|. The augmented base locus of D is
deﬁned as

where the intersection is taken over all ample divisors A such that D − A are Q-divisors. The
restricted base locus of D is deﬁned as

where the union is taken over all ample divisors A such that D + A are Q-divisors. We have
B−(D) ⊆ SB(D) ⊆ B+(D) for a Q-divisor D. One can check that a divisor D is ample (or
nef) if and only if B+(D) = ∅ (respectively, B−(D) = ∅). The asymptotic base loci B+(D) and
B−(D) depend only on the numerical class of D. For more details, see [ELMNP1], [ELMNP2].

2.2. Volume of a divisor. When D is a Q-divisor, the volume of D is deﬁned as

volS(D) := lim sup
m→∞

h0(S, OS (mD))

m2/2!

.

The volume volS(D) depends only on the numerical class of D. Furthermore, this function
uniquely extends to a continuous function

volS : Big(S) → R.

Note that if D is not big (i.e., S = B+(D)), then volS(D) = 0 . For more details, see [La].

Let V be a proper subvariety of S such that V 6⊆ B+(D). If dim V = 1, then the restricted

volume of D along V is deﬁned as

volS|V (D) := lim sup
m→∞

h0(S|V, mD)

m

where h0(S|V, mD) is the dimension of the image of the natural restriction map ϕ : H 0(S, OX (D)) →
H 0(V, OV (D)) ([ELMNP2, Deﬁnition 2.1]). If dim V = 0, then we simply let volS|V (D) = 1.
The restricted volume volX|V (D) depends only on the numerical class of D. Furthermore, this
function uniquely extends to a continuous function

volS|V : BigV (S) → R

where BigV (S) is the set of all R-divisor classes ξ such that V is not properly contained in any
irreducible component of B+(ξ). By [ELMNP2, Theorem 5.2], if V is an irreducible component
of B+(D), then volS|V (D) = 0. For more details, see [ELMNP2].

Now let V ⊆ S be a subvariety such that V 6⊆ B−(D). For an ample divisor A on S, we

deﬁne the augmented restricted volume of D along V as

vol+

S|V (D) := lim
ε→0+

volS|V (D + εA).

4

SUNG RAK CHOI, JINHYUNG PARK, AND JOONYEONG WON

The deﬁnition is independent of the choice of A. As with volS and volS|V , one can check
that the augmented restricted volume vol+
S|V (D) depends only on the numerical class of D.
By the continuity of the function volS|V , we see that vol+
S|V (D) coincides with volS|V (D) for
D ∈ BigV (S). For D ∈ BigV (S), the following inequalities hold by deﬁnition:

volS|V (D) ≤ vol+

S|V (D) ≤ volV (D|V ).

See [CHPW] for more properties of vol+

S|V .

2.3. Iitaka dimension. Let N(D) = {m ∈ Z>0| |⌊mD⌋| 6= ∅}. For m ∈ N(D), let ΦmD :
S 99K Pdim |⌊mD⌋| be the rational map deﬁned by the linear system |⌊mD⌋|. We deﬁne the Iitaka
dimension of D as the following value

κ(D) :=(cid:26) max{dim Im(ΦmD) | m ∈ N(D)} if N(D) 6= ∅

if N(D) = ∅.

−∞

Note that the Iitaka dimension κ(D) depends on the linear equivalence class of [D] ∈ Pic(S)⊗ R.
We also deﬁne the maximal Iitaka dimension of D as follows:

κmax(D) := max{κ(D′) | D ≡ D′}.

By deﬁnition, κmax(D) depends only on the numerical class [D] ∈ N1(X)R.

Fix a suﬃciently ample Z-divisor A on S. We deﬁne the numerical Iitaka dimension of D as

the nonnegative integer

κν (D) := max(cid:26)k ∈ Z≥0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) lim sup

m→∞

h0(S, OS (⌊mD⌋ + A))

mk

> 0(cid:27)

if h0(S, OS(⌊mD⌋ + A)) 6= ∅ for inﬁnitely many m > 0 and we let κν(D) := −∞ otherwise. The
numerical Iitaka dimension κν(D) depends only on the numerical class [D] ∈ N1(X)R. One can
easily check that κ(D) ≤ κν (D) holds and the inequality is strict in general (see [Le, Example
6.1]). However, if κν (D) = dim X, then κ(D) = dim X. See [Le] and [N] for detailed properties
of κ and κν .

2.4. Zariski decomposition. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on S. It is well known that
D admits the unique Zariski decomposition: D = P + N , where the positive part P is nef, the

negative part N = P aiNi is eﬀective, P.Ni = 0 for each irreducible component Ni, and the

intersection matrix (Ni.Nj) is negative deﬁnite if N 6= 0. Note that P is maximal in the sense
that if L is a nef divisor with L ≤ D, then L ≤ P . If D is a Q-divisor, then so are the positive
part P and the negative part N . The following is also well known (cf.
[ELMNP1, Example
1.11]).

Lemma 2.1. Let D = P + N be the Zariski decomposition of a pseudoeﬀective divisor D on a
surface S. Then B−(D) = Supp(N ). If we assume that D is big, then B+(D) = Null(P ).

Recall that the null locus Null(P ) of a nef and big divisor P on a surface S is the union of

all irreducible curves C on S with C.P = 0.

We now brieﬂy recall the s-decomposition. For more details, we refer to [P]. Let D be an

eﬀective Q-divisor on S. We deﬁne

Ns := inf{L | L ∼ D, L ≥ 0} and Ps := D − Ns.

Then we can check that Ps and Ns are Q-divisors. The expression D = Ps + Ns is the s-
decomposition of D. We note that Ps is the minimal in the sense that if L is an eﬀective divisor
with H 0(S, mL) ≃ H 0(S, mPs) for all suﬃciently divisible integers m > 0, then Ps ≤ L.

2.5. Chamber decomposition of the big cone. We recall the chamber decomposition of
the big cone Big(S) in the sense of [BKS]. Using the Zariski decomposition, we can deﬁne the
following chambers in Big(X).

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let D be a big divisor on a surface S and D = PD + ND its Zariski decompo-
sition.

(1) We deﬁne the Zariski chamber (associated to a nef divisor P ) as

ΣP := {D ∈ Big(S)| Supp(ND) = Null(P )}.

(2) We deﬁne the Stability chamber (associated to a big divisor D) as

SC(D) := {D′ ∈ Big(S)| B+(D) = B+(D′)}.

By [BKS, Theorem 2.2], whenever Int ΣP ∩ Int SC(D) 6= ∅, we have Int ΣP = Int SC(D). Thus
the chamber decompositions of Big(S) into the Zariski chambers and stability chambers only
diﬀer in the boundaries of the chambers; the two decompositions are essentially the same.

Theorem 2.3 ([BKS, Main Theorem]). The big cone Big(X) has a locally ﬁnite decomposition
into the Zariski chambers ΣP (or equivalently into the stability chambers SC(D) by the above
remark) that are locally rational polyhedral.

Remark 2.4. Let D be a big divisor on a surface S and D = PD +ND its Zariski decomposition.
(1) We note that all the stability chambers SC(D) intersect with the nef cone Nef(X) since
B+(D) = Null(PD) = B+(PD). However, a Zariski chamber ΣP can be disjoint from
the nef cone Nef(X) as can be checked in the example of [BKS, Example 3.5].

(2) We will see that the structure of the Okounkov body of D descends to that of the
positive part PD. Thus by (1), to study the structure of the Okounkov bodies of the
divisors in some stability chamber SC(D), it is actually enough to study the divisors in
SC(D) ∩ Nef(S). We will clarify this in Section 5.

3. Construction and basic properties of Okounkov bodies

In this section, we brieﬂy recall the construction of the Okounkov bodies of big divisors in
[LM] and [KK], and review the main results of [CHPW]. For simplicity, we only consider the
surface case. As before, let S be a smooth projective surface deﬁned over an algebraically closed
ﬁeld of characteristic zero. We ﬁx an admissible ﬂag on S

C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S

where C is an integral curve and x is a smooth point of C. For an eﬀective Cartier divisor D
on S and a section s ∈ H 0(S, OS (D)) \ {0}, we deﬁne the function

ν(s) = νC•(s) := (ν1(s), ν2(s)) ∈ Z2
≥0

as follows. First, let ν1(s) := ordC (s). Using a local equation f for C in S, we deﬁne a section
s′
1 = s ⊗ f −ν1(s) ∈ H 0(S, OS(D − ν1(s)C)). Since s′
1 does not vanish identically along C,
1|C ∈ H 0(C, OC (D − ν1(s)c)). Now take
its restriction s′
ν2(s) := ordx(s1). Note that ν2(s) does not depend on the choice of the local equation f .

1|C deﬁnes a nonzero section s1 := s′

3.1. Okounkov bodies of big divisors. Now assume that D is a big divisor on S. The
Okounkov body ∆C•(D) of D with respect to the admissible ﬂag C• is deﬁned as the closure of
the convex hull of νC• (|D|R) in R2

≥0 where we set |D|R := {D′ | D ∼R D′ ≥ 0}.

Theorem 3.1 ([LM, Theorem A]). We have volR2(∆C• (D)) = 1

2 volS(D).

Note that if D is not big, then volS(D) = 0.

3.2. Okounkov bodies of pseudoeﬀective divisors. When D is only pseudoeﬀective, there
are two natural ways to associate a lower dimensional convex body to D, which were introduced
in [CHPW].

Deﬁnition 3.2. (1) When D is eﬀective, i.e., |D|R 6= ∅, the valuative Okounkov body ∆val
C• (D) of
D with respect to the admissible ﬂag C• is deﬁned as the closure of the convex hull of νC•(|D|R)
in R2
(2) When D is pseudoeﬀective, the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim
admissible ﬂag C• is deﬁned as

≥0. If D is not eﬀective, we deﬁne ∆val

C• (D) of D with respect to the

C• (D) = ∅.

C• (D) := lim
ε→0+

∆C•(D + εA) = \ε>0

∆C•(D + εA)

where A is an ample divisor on S. Note that ∆lim
not pseudoeﬀective, we deﬁne ∆lim

C• (D) = ∅.
By deﬁnition, it is easy to check that ∆val

C• (D) ⊆ ∆lim

C• (D).

C• (D) is independent of the choice of A. If D is

Proposition 3.3 ([B, Proposition 3.3 and Lemma 4.8]). We have the following:

(1) dim ∆val
C• (D) = κ(D).
(2) κmax(D) ≤ dim ∆lim

C• (D) ≤ κν (D).

We now present examples for which the both inequalities in Proposition 3.3 (2) are strict.

Example 3.4. We give an example such that dim ∆lim
C• (D) does not coincide with κmax(D).
There exists a ruled surface S = P(E) such that H := OP(E)(1) is nef, κmax(H) = 0, and
κν (H) = 1. Let F be a ﬁber. Then the nef cone and the pseudoeﬀective cone of S coincide and
it is generated by H and F . For any irreducible curve C on S, we may write C ≃ aH + bF for
some rational numbers a, b ≥ 0. We ﬁx an admissible ﬂag

C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S

where x is any smooth point on C. If b = 0, then a > 0 and

so that dim ∆lim

C• (H) = 1. If b > 0, then

∆lim

C• (H) =(cid:26)(x1, 0) ∈ R2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 0 ≤ x1 ≤

a(cid:27)

∆lim

C• (H) = {(0, x2) ∈ R2 | 0 ≤ x2 ≤ b}

so that dim ∆lim

C• (H) = 1.

Example 3.5. Here we give an example such that dim ∆lim

C• (D) < κν(D). Let S be the surface

as in Example 3.4 and π : eS → S be the blow-up at any point y ∈ S with the exceptional divisor

E. We ﬁx an admissible ﬂag

where x is a general point on E. Then we can easily see that ∆lim
κν (π∗H) = κν (H) = 1.

C• (π∗H) = {(0, 0)} even though

C• : {x} ⊆ E ⊆ eS

Actually, ∆lim

C• (π∗H) is the inﬁnitesimal limiting Okounkov body ∆lim

inf (H) which we will deﬁne
inf (D) = max{0, κmax(D)} for the surface case

below in Deﬁnition 3.6. We will show that dim ∆lim
(see Corollary 4.18).

Deﬁnition 3.6. Let π : eS → S be the blow-up at a point y ∈ S with the exceptional divisor E.

We consider an admissible ﬂag

C• : {x} ⊆ E ⊆ eS

If D is a big divisor on S and we choose y ∈ S and x ∈ E very generally, then all ∆C• (π∗D)
coincide by [LM, Proposition E]. Similarly, even in the case where D is pseudoeﬀective, we can
also easily check that ∆lim
inf (D)
are well-deﬁned.

C• (π∗D) all coincide. Thus the above deﬁnitions of ∆inf(D) and ∆lim

In [CHPW], the following two special subvarieties were introduced and studied.

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let D be a divisor on a surface S.

(1) For an eﬀective divisor D on S, a smooth subvariety U ⊆ S is called a Nakayama subva-

riety of D if κ(D) = dim U and the natural map

H 0(S, OS(⌊mD⌋)) → H 0(U, OU (⌊mD|U ⌋))

is injective (or equivalently, H 0(S, IU ⊗ OS (⌊mD⌋)) = 0 where IU is an ideal sheaf of U
in S) for every integer m ≥ 0.

(2) For a pseudoeﬀective divisor D on S, a subvariety V ⊆ X of dimension κν (D) such that

vol+

S|V (D) > 0 and V 6⊆ B−(D) is called a positive volume subvariety of D.

By deﬁnition, U = S is the Nakayama subvariety (or positive volume subvariety) of D if
and only if D is big. It is proven that any general subvariety U ⊆ S of dimension κ(D) is a
Nakayama subvariety of D. Similarly, any general subvariety V ⊆ S of dimension κν (D) is a
Nakayama subvariety of D.

In [CHPW], the following were shown:
(1) If an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S contains a Nakayama subvariety U of D and x is a
C• (D) ⊆ Rκ(D)
≥0 .
(2) If an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S contains a positive volume subvariety V of D,

C• (D) ⊆ {0}2−κ(D) × Rκ(D)

Theorem 3.8 ([CHPW, Theorems A and B]). Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on a surface
S, and ﬁx an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S. We have the following:

(1) Suppose that D is eﬀective, the admissible ﬂag C• contains a Nakayama subvariety U of

D, and x is a general point. Then

dim ∆val

C• (D) = κ(D) and volRκ(D)(∆val

C• (D)) = volS|U (D).

(2) Suppose that the admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S contains a positive volume subvariety

V of D. Then

dim ∆lim

C• (D) = κν(D) and volRκν (D)(∆lim

S|V (D).

4. Limiting Okounkov bodies of pseudoeffective divisors on surfaces

The aim of this section is to give an explicit description of the Okounkov bodies of pseudo-
eﬀective divisors on a smooth surface. We ﬁrst review the known properties of the Okounkov
bodies of big divisors, and give simple proofs which also work for the limiting Okounkov bod-
ies of pseudoeﬀective divisors. Next, we prove the main results Theorems 4.12 and 4.15, and
present some applications. As before, S denotes a smooth projective surface deﬁned over an
algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero.

4.1. Nakayama constant and Zariski decomposition. For a pseudoeﬀective divisor D on
S and a subvariety V of S, we deﬁne the Nakayama constant of D along V as

µ(D; V ) := sup{s ≥ 0 | f ∗D − sE is pseudoeﬀective}

where f : eS → S is the blow-up of S at V with the exceptional divisor E. Note that if V is an
integral curve, then we take f = id, eS = S and E = C.

The Nakayama constant and Zariski decomposition play an important role in studying the

Okounkov body as in the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1 ([LM, Theorem 6.4] and [CHPW, Theorem 4.4]). Let D be a pseudoeﬀective
divisor on a surface S. Fix an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S. Let a := multC N where
D = P + N is the Zariski decomposition, and µ := µ(D; C). Consider a divisor Dt := D − tC
for a ≤ t ≤ µ. Denote by Dt = Pt + Nt the Zariski decomposition. Let α(t) := ordx(Nt|C) and
β(t) := α(t) + C.Pt. Then the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim

C• (D) of D is given by

∆lim

C• (D) = {(x1, x2) | a ≤ x1 ≤ µ and α(x1) ≤ x2 ≤ β(x2)}.

Now we show some basic properties of the Nakayama constant and the Zariski decomposition

on a surface.

Lemma 4.2. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on a surface S, and D = P + N be the Zariski
decomposition. For an integral curve, we have µ(D; C) = µ(P ; C) + multC N .

Proof. By replacing D by D − (multC N ) C, we can assume that C is not in the support of N .
Then we only have to show that µ(D; C) = µ(P ; C). Note that µ(D; C) ≥ µ(P ; C). Thus it
is suﬃcient to show that if D − tC is pseudoeﬀective for some t ≥ 0, then so is P − tC. Let
D − tC = Pt + Nt be the Zariski decomposition. Then

P + N = D = Pt + Nt + tC.

By the maximal property of the positive part of the Zariski decomposition, we obtain N ≤
Nt + tC. Since C is not an irreducible component of N , the divisor Nt − N is eﬀective. Then
P − tC = Pt + (Nt − N ) is pseudoeﬀective as desired.

The following was ﬁrst established in [KLM, Proposition 2.1] for big divisors.

Corollary 4.3. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on S with the Zariski decomposition D =
P + N , and C be an integral curve in S. Assume that C is not an irreducible component
of N . For t1 > t2 ≥ 0, assume that D − t1C is pseudoeﬀective so that we have the Zariski
decompositions D − t1C = Pt1 + Nt1 and D − t2C = Pt2 + Nt2. Then Nt1 ≥ Nt2.

Proof. The assertion was already shown in the proof of Lemma 4.2.

(cid:3)

Next, we show the rationality of the Nakayama constant of a non-big pseudoeﬀective divisor.

Lemma 4.4. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective Q-divisor on a surface S, and D = P +N be the Zariski
decomposition. If D is not big, then µ(D; C) is a rational number for any integral curve C in
S.

Proof. By Lemma 4.2, we have µ(D; C) = µ(P ; C) + multC N . Thus it suﬃces to show that
µ := µ(P ; C) is a rational number. Let P − µC = Pµ + Nµ be the Zariski decomposition.
Suppose that P.C > 0. By Theorem 4.1, we get

∆lim

C• (D) = {(0, x2) | 0 ≤ x2 ≤ P.C}

where C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S and x ∈ C is any point. Thus µ = 0. It remains to consider the case
P.C = 0. Then we have P.Pµ = 0. By the Hodge index theorem, we have Pµ = kP for some
k ≥ 0. By the deﬁnition of the Nakayama constant, we get k = 0. Thus P = Nµ + µC. We can
conclude that µ is a rational number.

Remark 4.5. If D is big, then µ(D; C) is a rational number or satisﬁes a quadratic equation
over Q by [KLM, Proposition 2.2].

We further study some easy properties of the Zariski decompositions of divisors of the form

P − tC.

Lemma 4.6. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on S with the Zariski decomposition D = P +N ,
and C be an integral curve in S. Assume that C is not an irreducible component of N . For t > 0,
assume that D−tC is pseudoeﬀective so that we have the Zariski decomposition D−tC = Pt+Nt.
Then we have the following:

(1) C is not a component of Nt.
(2) If E is an integral curve such that P.E = 0, E2 < 0, and E 6= C, then Pt + (Nt + sE) is

the Zariski decomposition for s ≥ 0.

Proof. (1) If C is a component of Nt, then D = Pt + (Nt + tC) is the Zariski decomposition.
However, N 6= Nt + tC, so we get a contradiction.
(2) Note that (P − tC).E ≤ 0. Thus Nt.E ≤ 0, so either E is an irreducible component of Nt
or E does not meet Nt. For the latter case, we have Pt.E = Nt.E = 0. Thus in any case, we
obtain Pt.(Nt + E) = 0 and the intersection matrix of Nt + sE is negative deﬁnite.
(cid:3)

The following is well known.

Lemma 4.7. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on S, and D = P + N be the Zariski decompo-
sition. Fix an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S. Then we have

∆lim

C• (D) = ∆lim

C• (P ) + (multC N, ordx((N − (multC N )C)|C )).

Proof. First, consider the case C ⊆ B−(D). Set a := multC N > 0. It is easy to see that

∆lim

C• (D) = ∆lim

C• (D − aC) + (a, 0).

By replacing D by D − aC, we may only consider the case C 6⊆ B−(D). Then it is suﬃcient to
show that

(!)

∆lim

C• (D) = ∆lim

C• (P ) + (0, ordx(N |C )).

Fix t > 0 such that P −tC is pseudoeﬀective. Let P −tC = Pt +Nt be the Zariski decomposition.
By Lemma 4.6, P + N − tC = Pt + (Nt + N ) is the Zariski decomposition. Then the assertion
(!) now follows from Theorem 4.1.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.8. We can easily verify that a similar statement of Lemma 4.7 holds for the valuative
Okounkov body ∆val
C• (D) of an eﬀective divisor D. Let D = Ps + Ns be the s-decomposition.
Then we have

∆val

C• (D) = ∆val

C• (Ps) + (multC Ns, ordx((Ns − (multC Ns)C)|C)).

4.2. Asymptotic base loci via Okounkov bodies. Here we give simpler proofs for the fol-
lowing two theorems. These were ﬁrst shown in [KL, Theorem A] for big divisors.

Theorem 4.9. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on a surface S. Then the following are
equivalent:

(1) x ∈ B−(D).
(2) For every ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S, the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim

C• (D) does not contain

the origin of R2.

(3) For some ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S, the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim

C• (D) does not contain

the origin of R2.

Proof. Let D = P + N be the Zariski decomposition.
(1) ⇒ (2): Since ordx(N |C ) > 0, the assertion follows from Theorem 4.1.
(2) ⇒ (3): It is obvious.
(3) ⇒ (1): By Theorem 4.1, we have either multC N > 0 or ordx(N |C ) > 0. In both cases, an
irreducible component of N passes through x, so x ∈ B−(D).
(cid:3)

Remark 4.10. We cannot replace ∆lim
blow-up π : S → P2 of P2 at 9 general points on a cubic curve C in P2. Note that −KS = π−1
is nef and κ(−KS) = 0. Consider an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ π−1
smooth point in π−1

C• (D). For an explicit example, we consider the
∗ C
∗ C ⊆ S, where x is any

∗ C. Then we can easily see that

C• (D) by ∆val

∆val

C• (−KS) = {(1, 0)}

which does not contain the origin even though −KS is nef. However, we have

∆lim

C• (−KS) = {(x1, 0) | 0 ≤ x1 ≤ 1}

which contains the origin of R2.

Theorem 4.11. Let D be a pseudoeﬀective divisor on a surface S. Then the following are
equivalent:

U ∩ R2

(3) For some ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S, the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim
≥0 where U is a small open neighborhood of the origin of R2.
Proof. If D is pseudoeﬀective but not big, then B+(D) = S and dim ∆lim
C• (D) < 2 for any ﬂag
C•. In this case, there is nothing to prove. Thus we only have to consider the case where D is
big. Let D = P + N be the Zariski decomposition.
(1) ⇒ (2): By considering Theorem 4.9, we can assume that x ∈ B+(D)\B−(D). By Lemma 4.7,
we obtain ∆lim
C• (P ). We divide into two cases. First, consider the case C ⊆ B+(P ) =
Null(P ), i.e., P.C = 0. In this case, ∆lim
C• (P ) does not meet the x2-axis by Theorem 4.1. More
precisely, for any (0, y) with y > 0, we have (0, y) 6∈ ∆lim
C• (P ). Now, consider the remaining case
C 6⊆ B+(P ). We can take an integral curve E such that x ∈ E ⊆ B+(P ) = Null(P ). Note
that C 6= E but both C and E contain x. Thus C.E > 0 so that (P − tC).E < 0 for all t > 0.
Since P is big, P − t0C is pseudoeﬀective for some t0 > 0. Let P − t0C = Pt0 + Nt0 be the
Zariski decomposition. Then Nt0.E < 0 so that E is an irreducible component of Nt0. Thus
ordx(Nt0 |C) > 0. In view of Theorem 4.1, ∆lim
C• (D) does not meet the x1-axis. That is, for any
(y, 0) with y > 0, we have (y, 0) 6∈ ∆lim
(2) ⇒ (3): It is obvious.
(3) ⇒ (1): Suppose that x 6∈ B+(D). For an ample divisor A and a suﬃciently small ε > 0, we
have B+(D) = B−(D − εA). By Theorem 4.9, the origin is contained in ∆lim
C• (D − εA). Now we
have

C• (D).

∆lim
C• (εA) contains U ∩ R2

C• (D − εA) + ∆lim
≥0, so does ∆lim

C• (D).

Since ∆lim

C• (εA) ⊆ ∆lim

C• (D).

4.3. Computing limiting Okounkov bodies. We now prove the main results of this section.
When D is a big divisor on a surface S, Theorem 4.1 and [KLM, Theorem B] completely
characterize the Okounkov body ∆C•(D) of D with respect to any admissible ﬂag C•. Our main
results, Theorems 4.12 and 4.15, can be regarded as a natural extention of [KLM, Theorem B]
to the case of pseudoeﬀective divisors.

OKOUNKOV BODIES AND ZARISKI DECOMPOSITIONS ON SURFACES

11

Theorem 4.12. Let D be a non-big pseudoeﬀective divisor on a surface S, and D = P + N be
the Zariski decomposition. Fix an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S. Then

∆lim

C• (D) = ∆lim
C• (P ) is given as follows:

and ∆lim

C• (P ) + (multC N, ordx((N − (multC N )C)|C )),

(1) Suppose that P.C > 0. Then C is the positive volume subvariety of D and κν(D) = 1.

Furthermore, we have

∆lim

C• (P ) = {(x1, x2) | 0 ≤ x2 ≤ P.C}.

Hence, dim(∆lim

C• (D)) = 1 and volR1(∆lim

C• (D)) = vol+

S|C(D) = P.C.

(2) Suppose that P.C = 0. Let µ := µ(D; C). If µ > 0, then κmax(D) ≥ 0, and we can write

P ≡ µC + N ′ for some eﬀective divisor N ′. In this case, we have

∆lim

C• (P ) = {(x1, x2) | 0 ≤ x1 ≤ µ, x2 = ordx(N ′|C )

µ

x1}

Furthermore, dim(∆lim

C• (D)) = 0 if µ = 0 and dim(∆lim

C• (D)) = 1 = κν (D) if µ > 0.

Proof. By Lemma 4.6, we can assume that D = P . By Theorem 4.9, the origin of R2 is contained
in ∆lim
C• (D). If P.C > 0, then the assertion immediately follows from Theorem 3.8 and Theorem
4.1 (see also [CHPW]). It remains to consider the case P.C = 0. If µ = 0, then ∆lim
C• (D) is the
origin of R2, and there is nothing to prove. We now suppose that µ > 0. Let P − µC = Pµ + Nµ
be the Zariski decomposition. We claim that Pµ = 0. If this claim holds, then the remaining
assertion is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.1. We have P.(P − µC) = P.Pµ + P.Nµ. Since
P 2 = P.C = 0, it follows that P.Pµ = 0. Thus Pµ = kP for some k ≥ 0. By the deﬁnition of
the Nakayama constant, we obtain k = 0, so we are done.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.13. For the last case of Theorem 4.12, the volume of the limiting Okounkov body
∆lim

C• (D) ispµ2 + ordx(N ′|C )2. However, the geometric meaning is not clear to us.

Next examples show that all the cases in Theorem 4.12 do occur.

Example 4.14. (1) By [CHPW], there always exists a positive volume subvariety of any pseu-
doeﬀective divisor, so the ﬁrst case of Theorem 4.12 does occur.
(2) We give examples of the second case of Theorem 4.12 with µ = 0. For any ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆
C ⊆ S, we have ∆lim
C• (OS) = {(0, 0)}. In this case, κν (OS) = κ(OS) = 0. On the other hand,
Example 3.5 gives an example of ∆lim
(3) Remark 4.10 gives an example of the second case of Theorem 4.12 with µ > 0 and a hori-
zontal limiting Okounkov body. In this case, note that κ(−KS) = 0.
(4) For an example of the second case of Theorem 4.12 with µ > 0 and a limiting Okounkov
body with a positive slope, consider a ﬁbration f : S → C onto a curve C. Assume that there
exists a ﬁber F of f such that we can write

C• (D) = {(0, 0)}, but κν (D) = 1.

where C1 and C2 are integral curves transversally meeting at a point x and E is an eﬀective
divisor whose support does not contain neither C1 nor C2.

F = pC1 + qC2 + E

For the existence of such a ﬁbration, see the proof of Theorem 4.15. Consider the admissible

ﬂags C1• : {x} ⊆ C1 ⊆ S and C2• : {x} ⊆ C2 ⊆ S. Then we can see that
∆lim

C1• (F ) = {(x1, x2) | 0 ≤ x1 ≤ p, x2 =

C2•(F ) = {(x1, x2) | 0 ≤ x1 ≤ q, x2 =

In this case, note that κ(F ) = 1.

By Lemma 4.4 and Theorem 4.12, the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim

C• (D) is a line segment in
R2 with a rational slope when D is a Q-divisor. We show that the converse of this statement
also holds.

Theorem 4.15. Let r ∈ Q≥0 be any nonnegative rational number. Then there exist a smooth
projective surface S, a pseudoeﬀective Q-divisor D on S, and an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆
S such that the limiting Okounkov body ∆lim
Proof. By Example 4.14, we only have to deal with the case r = p
q > 0 with relatively prime
positive integers p and q. It suﬃces to show the existence of a ﬁbration f : S → C such that a
ﬁber F of f can be written as

C• (D) has a slope r.

F = pC1 + qC2 + E

where C1 and C2 are integral curves transversally meeting at a point x and E is an eﬀective
divisor whose support does not contain neither C1 nor C2. For this purpose, we ﬁrst consider
P1 × P1 with a ﬁbration P1 × P1 → P1. For any integer m > 0, by taking a successive blow-ups
of P1 × P1, we can make one ﬁber contain two irreducible components with multiplicities 1 and
m transversally meeting at a point. Suppose that we have one ﬁber containing two irreducible
components with multiplicities m and n transversally meeting at a point. Then by taking a
successive blow-ups of that surface, we can obtain a ﬁber containing two irreducible components
with multiplicities m + kn and n for any integer k > 0 transversally meeting at a point. By
considering the Euclidean algorithm for p and q, we can take a successive blow-ups of P1×P1 such
that the resulting surface has a ﬁber containing two irreducible components with multiplicities
p and q transversally meeting at a point.
(cid:3)

Remark 4.16. It is shown in [KLM, Theorem B] that any real polygon satisfying some con-
ditions in R2
≥0 can be realized as the Okounkov body of a big divisor on a smooth projective
toric surface. The example given in the proof of Theorem 4.15 is also a smooth projective toric
surface.

For the valuative Okounkov body ∆val

C• (D) of an eﬀective divisor D, the analogous statement
to Theorem 4.12 also holds. Since the proof is similar to that of Theorem 4.12 and Theorem
4.15, we omit it here. Recall that we always have dim ∆val
C• (D) = κ(D) by Proposition 3.3 (1).
Theorem 4.17. Let D be an eﬀective divisor on a surface S, and D = Ps + Ns be the s-
decomposition. Assume that D is not big. Fix an admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S. Then

∆val

C• (D) = ∆val
C• (Ps) is given as follows:

and ∆val

C• (Ps) + (multC Ns, ordx((Ns − (multC Ns)C)|C)),

(1) Suppose that Ps.C > 0. Then κ(D) = 1, and we have

∆val

C• (Ps) = {(x1, x2) | 0 ≤ x2 ≤ volS|C(D)}.

(2) Suppose that Ps.C = 0. Let µ := µ(D; C).

C• (Ps) = {(0, 0)} and
κ(D) = 0. If µ > 0, then κ(D) = 1 and we can write Ps ∼ µC + N ′ for some eﬀective
divisor N ′. In this case, we have ∆val

If µ = 0, then ∆val

C• (Ps) = ∆lim

C• (Ps).

In particular, if D is a Q-divisor, then the valuative Okounkov body ∆val
C• (D) is a line segment in
R2
≥0 with a nonnegative rational slope with rational end points. Conversely, for any nonnegative
rational number r ∈ Q≥0, there exists a smooth projective surface S, an eﬀective Q-divisor D
on S, and an admissible ﬂag C• such that the valuative Okounkov body ∆val
C• (D) has a slope r.

OKOUNKOV BODIES AND ZARISKI DECOMPOSITIONS ON SURFACES

13

As the ﬁrst application of our main results, we can completely understand the inﬁnitesimal

limiting Okounkov body of a pseudoeﬀective divisor.

Corollary 4.18. Let D be a non-big pseudoeﬀective divisor on a surface S. Let x ∈ S be a
general point. Then we have

∆lim

inf (D) = {(x1, 0) | 0 ≤ x1 ≤ µ(D; x)}.

Hence, dim ∆lim

inf (D) = max{0, κmax(D)} and volR1 ∆lim

inf (D) = µ(D; x).

Proof. Let D = P + N be the Zariski decomposition, and f : eS → S be the blow-up at a

general point x ∈ S with the exceptional divisor E. Then f ∗D = f ∗P + f ∗N is the Zariski
decomposition. Note that f ∗P.E = 0. By the generality assumption, we may assume that
x is not contained in the support of N . Thus by Lemma 4.7, we have ∆lim
inf (P ).
Consequently, ∆lim
If κmax(D) = −∞ or 0,
then by the generality assumption, ∆lim
inf (D) = {(0, 0)}. If κmax(D) = 1, then by the generality
assumption and Theorem 4.12, the assertion follows.
(cid:3)

inf (D) contains the origin of R2 by Theorem 4.9.

inf (D) = ∆lim

4.4. Seshadri constant. Finally, we compute the Seshadri constant via the limiting Okounkov
body. For a nef divisor D and a subvariety V , we deﬁne the Seshadri constant of D along V as
follows:

ε(D; V ) := sup{s ≥ 0 | f ∗D − sE is nef}

where f : eS → S is the blow-up of S at V with the exceptional divisor E. Note that if V is an
integral curve, then we take f = id, eS = S and E = V . We can compute the Seshadri constant

along an integral curve by using the limiting Okounkov bodies.

Theorem 4.19. Let D be a nef divisor and C be a smooth curve on S. Then we have

ε(D; C) = inf
x∈C

{s | (s, 0) 6∈ ∆lim

C• (D) where C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S is an admissible ﬂag}.

Proof. For 0 ≤ t ≤ µ(D; C), let D − tC = Pt + Nt be the Zariski decomposition. If Nt = 0 for
all 0 ≤ t ≤ µ(D; C), then the assertion is trivial. Thus we now assume that Ns 6= 0 for some
0 < s ≤ µ(D; C). Then we see that

We denote by

ε := ε(D; C) = inf{s | Ns 6= 0}.

{s | (s, 0) 6∈ ∆lim

C• (D) where C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S is an admissible ﬂag}.

ε′ := inf
x∈C
If (s, 0) 6∈ ∆lim
C• (D) for some admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S and s ≤ µ(D; C), then by
Theorem 4.1, ordx(Ns|C) > 0 so that Ns 6= 0. For the converse, we consider the case Ns 6= 0 for
some 0 < s ≤ µ(D; C). By lemma 4.6 (1), C is not a component of Ns. Suppose that C.Ns = 0.
Since the intersection matrix of irreducible components of Ns is negative deﬁnite, there is an
eﬀective divisor E such that Supp(E) ⊆ Supp(Ns) and E.Ns < 0. Then we obtain

D.E = (Ps + Ns + sC).E = Ns.E < 0,

which is a contradiction. Thus C.Ns > 0, so C meets Ns at a point x. For the admissible ﬂag
C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S, we get (s, 0) 6∈ ∆lim
(cid:3)

C• (D). Hence we are done.

Corollary 4.20. Let D be a nef divisor on S, and x be a point in S. If D is not big, then
ε(D; x) = 0.

Proof. Let f : eS → S be the blow-up of S at x with the exceptional divisor E, and µ :=

µ(D; x) = µ(f ∗D; E). We only have to consider the case µ > 0 since ε(D; x) ≤ µ(D; x). Thus
we are in the second case of Theorem 4.12 and we have f ∗D ≡ µE + N ′ for some eﬀective divisor
N ′. Since f ∗D.E = 0, it follows that N ′.E > 0. By Lemma 4.6 (1), E is not a component of

14

SUNG RAK CHOI, JINHYUNG PARK, AND JOONYEONG WON

N ′. Thus E meets N ′ at a point x. For any 0 < s < µ, note that f ∗D − sE = (µ − s)E + N ′ =
µ−s
µ N ′ is the Zariski decomposition. Thus for the admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ E ⊆ S, we
µ f ∗D + s
get (s, 0) 6∈ ∆lim

C• (f ∗D). By Theorem 4.19, ε(D; x) = 0.

(cid:3)

5. Okounkov bodies on chambers

In this section, we study how the shape of the Okounkov body ∆Y•(D) changes as we vary D
within the big cone. We ﬁrst need to clarify what we mean by saying that ∆Y•(D) and ∆Y•(D′)
have the same shape.

Deﬁnition 5.1. Let ∆, ∆′ ⊆ R2 be convex rational polytopes of dimension two. We say ∆ and
∆′ are similar and write ∆ ≈ ∆′ if ∆, ∆′ have the same number of vertices {v1, · · · , vm = v0},
{w1, · · · , wm = w0}, and edges {vivi+1}, {wiwi+1}, respectively, that can be labeled in such a
way that the rays −−−→vivi+1 and −−−−→wiwi+1 are parallel for all i.

We deﬁne the Minkowski sum of two subsets ∆, ∆′ ⊆ R2 as

A Minkowski chamber M (with respect to a given admissible ﬂag) is a chamber in Eﬀ(X)

ai∆Y•(Di).

Remark 5.3. Note that if D is a big divisor on a surface S and D = P + N is the Zariski
decomposition, then D and P belong to the same stability chamber SC(D). (This is not true
for the Zariski chamber ΣP .) Furthermore, for some suitably chosen admissible ﬂag C•, by
considering Lemma 4.7, we have ∆C•(D) = ∆C•(P ). Thus it is enough to consider the SC-
decomposition of the nef cone Nef(X) contained in Big(X). This is the strategy we will take in
the proof of the following result.

The following is the main result of this section.

Theorem 5.4. Let S be a smooth projective surface such that the pseudoeﬀective cone Eﬀ(S)
is rational polyhedral. Let {Di|i ∈ I} be a ﬁnite set of big divisors contained in a ﬁxed stability
chamber SC. Then there exits an admissible ﬂag C• such that ∆C• (Di) for all i ∈ I are similar.

OKOUNKOV BODIES AND ZARISKI DECOMPOSITIONS ON SURFACES

Proof. We closely follow the construction of Minkowski chambers as in [LS]. Fix a ﬁnite set
{Di| i ∈ I} of big divisors on X contained in a stability chamber SC as in the statement. Let
N1, · · · , Nr be the prime divisors contained in the support of the negative part of the divisors
in Int SC. Let F ⊆ Nef(X) be the face of Nef(X) that is supported by the linear subspace
N ⊥
r . Let C = Y1 be a nef and big divisor contained
in F . By Remark 5.3, we may assume that Di are nef and big divisors since C 6∈ {N1, · · · , Nr}.
By choosing C generally, we may further assume that the following condition is satisﬁed: there
exits an extremal ray R′ of F such that the divisors Di are contained in the cone spanned by C
and the extremal rays of F except the ray R′:

r , i.e., F = Nef(X) ∩ N ⊥

Rj + R≥ · [C] for all i.

mXj=1

The cone on the right is actually M ∩ Nef(X) for some Minkowski chamber M containing all
the divisors Di. Therefore, by [LS] and Lemma 5.2, all the Okounkov bodies ∆C•(Di) are
similar.

Corollary 5.5. Let S be a smooth projective surface such that the pseudoeﬀective cone Eﬀ(S)
is rational polyhedral. For a given stability chamber SC, if its closure has an extremal ray R
spanned by a big divisor, then we can take an inﬁnite set {Di| i ∈ I} in Theorem 5.4.
In
particular, if C is a prime divisor spanning R, then ∆C•(D) for all D ∈ SC are all similar.

Proof. Suppose that SC has an extremal ray R spanned by a big divisor C and {Di|i ∈ I} is an
inﬁnite set of big divisors contained in SC. With respect to the admissible ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S,
the Minkowski chamber M containing the divisors Di is just the stability chamber SC. Thus by
Lemma 5.2, the statement follows.

The following example shows that the Okounkov bodies within a stability chamber can have

diﬀerent shapes.

Example 5.6. Consider the blow-up f : S → P2 of P2 at two distinct points in P2 with the
exceptional divisors E1, E2. Denote by H the pullback of the line in P2 to S. Fix an admissible
ﬂag C• : {x} ⊆ C ⊆ S where C is an integral curve linearly equivalent to H − E1 − E2 and
x is a general point in C. Let D1 := 2H − E1 − E2 and D2 := 3H − 2E1 − E2. Then D1
and D2 are nef and big divisors, and B+(D1) = B+(D2) = {C}. Thus D1 and D2 are in the
same stability chamber. However, the Okounkov bodies ∆C•(D1) and ∆C•(D2) are given in the
following picture, and they have diﬀerent shapes.
