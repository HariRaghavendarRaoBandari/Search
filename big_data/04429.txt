Birdsong dialect patterns explained using magnetic domains

Department of Mathematics, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, PO1 3HF, United Kingdom

James Burridge∗ and Steven Kenney

(Dated: March 16, 2016)

The songs and calls of many bird species, like human speech, form distinct regional dialects. We
suggest that the process of dialect formation is analogous to the physical process of magnetic domain
formation. We take the coastal breeding grounds of the Puget Sound white crowned sparrow as an
example. Previous ﬁeld studies suggest that birds of this species learn multiple songs early in life,
and when establishing a territory for the ﬁrst time, retain one of these dialects in order to match
the majority of their neighbours. We introduce a simple lattice model of the process, showing that
this matching behaviour can produce single dialect domains provided the death rate of adult birds
is suﬃciently low. We relate death rate to thermodynamic temperature in magnetic materials, and
calculate the critical death rate by analogy with the Ising model. Using parameters consistent with
the known behavior of these birds we show that coastal dialect domain shapes may be explained by
viewing them as low temperature “stripe states”.

INTRODUCTION

Under certain conditions physical systems of interact-
ing particles form spatially ordered states. An old and
famous example is the spontaneous magnetization of cer-
tain metals as they cool below the Curie temperature.
The classic “Ising model” of this process also serves as
a simple description of the appearance of order in so-
cial systems [1]. Whereas the directional alignment of
neighbouring atomic spins within ferromagnetic materi-
als produces an energetically favourable state, individuals
in society ﬁnd that aligning their behaviours with those
of their neighbours can provide social beneﬁts, or indicate
the intrinsic ﬁtness of the individual. In this paper, we
introduce an ornithological application of this analogy.

Almost all birds sing or call.

In some species these
sounds are encoded in the DNA, while others learn [2].
From whom they learn and at what point in their lives
varies: some birds ﬁx their songs early in life, some con-
tinue learning throughout. Some learn from their parents
and some from neighbours. Many song birds, but also
some hummingbirds [3] and parrots [4], exhibit vocal di-
alects: the nature of their songs or calls varies geograph-
ically with well deﬁned and sharp boundaries between
dialect domains. Because the learning mechanisms and
social behaviours of diﬀerent species vary considerably, so
the nature and dynamics of dialect domains is also rather
varied. However, the fundamental ingredients of copying,
set against randomizing inﬂuences such as dispersion and
death suggest that an analogy to atomic alignment and
thermal noise (or random motion) may be a useful way
to understand the geographical distribution of birdsong
dialects. In this paper we will show that such an anal-
ogy can provide analytical insight into ﬁeld observations
(in particular by Nelson [5]) of a particular species: the
Puget Sound white crowned sparrow.

∗ james.burridge@port.ac.uk

During the breeding season, Puget Sound white
crowned sparrows occupy territories along the Paciﬁc
Northwest coast of North America, having ﬂown 500-
1900km from their wintering grounds in California [5].
Their songs may be analysed using audio spectograms,
and the ﬁrst such study (in 1977) of this species [6] re-
vealed a number of distinct dialects, deﬁned by the nature
of their terminal trills, occupying well deﬁned geograph-
ical regions along the coast. Subsequent studies have
revealed the dialects illustrated on the map in Figure 1.

Male Puget sound white crowned sparrows are territo-
rial, and adults returning to the breeding grounds typi-
cally reoccupy the territory they used the previous year
and also sing the same song from year to year. Field ob-
servations and recordings suggest that male juvenile birds
are able to learn more than one dialect in their hatching
year, as they visit surrounding domains that are often
separated by more than 100km [5]. When returning to
the breeding sites in the following year these yearlings
“overproduce” [9], initially singing more than one (typ-
ically two) dialects. The majority of existing adult ter-
ritory holders arrive earlier than yearling males, so that
when yearlings return and select an available territory,
a number of neighbouring birds will be audible. Field
observations and playback experiments [5] demonstrate
that new territory holders who overproduce selectively
discard dialects so as to match the majority dialect in
their vicinity. Once a ﬁnal selection has been made by a
yearling, it sings the same song in subsequent years. It
is hypothesized by ornithologists that this combination
of overproduction and selective attrition gives rise to the
observed dialect domains. We present a simple lattice
model of this process which we use to quantify the con-
ditions under which domains form. Using insights from
the statistical physics of magnetism, we show that sur-
face tension at domain boundaries and the formation of
stripe states can be used to explain ﬁeld observations of
domain structure.

nia. The average lifespan of a bird is ≈ 2.5 years, which
translates to a yearly death probability of α = 0.4, if we
approximate the lifespan as a geometric random random
variable. The process of repopulating the lattice each
breeding season takes place in stages. In the ﬁrst stage,
all surviving adults reoccupy their previous territories as
shown in Figure 2. Non-returning adults are represented
by grey squares in Figure 2, and we assume that the pop-
ulation is stable so that all of these territories will be oc-
cupied by yearlings. We consider two possible processes
of reoccupation:

II. THE MODEL

We represent territories as squares on a regular lat-
tice, as in Figure 2. On the ground, the average distance
between the centres of territories is ≈ 115m [10]. Since
dialects extend over considerable distances, then at the
boundary between two domains, typically only two dif-
ferent songs will be sung by the majority of adults so the
competition between dialects locally involves two choices.
We therefore consider two adult song types, “up” ↑ and
“down” ↓, thereby simplifying the analysis of our model.
At the end of the breeding season, each site in our sys-
tem is occupied either by a returning adult bird, or by
a yearling who has settled upon his ﬁnal song type, to
be sung every following year until his death. Each year,
each adult bird has a probability α of failing to make it
back to the breeding grounds after wintering in Califor-

A. Single phase reoccupation

In the ﬁrst version of the model, we assume that year-
ling birds listen only to preexisting adults, and ignore
each other. A (possible) justiﬁcation of this assumption
is that yearling birds will sing more than one dialect,
therefore providing no clear signal to other birds. Un-
der this assumption, when a grey site is repopulated, the
yearling in that site can only “see” the adults around
it. In this case we assume that, based on ﬁeld observa-
tions [5], the yearling will match the majority of his adult
neighbours. If neither dialect is in the majority then the
yearling will chose between the two available dialects with
equal probability. We consider two diﬀerent possibilities

for the audible neighbourhood: the four nearest neigh-
bour territories (outlined in bold for the central site in
Figure 2), or the eight territories which form a square
around each site.

B. Multiple phase reoccupation

Following the arrival of adult birds, the majority year-
ling birds then arrive within a window of approximately
one month [5]. The median time to discard non-matching
dialects is then 12 days, potentially allowing new terri-
tory holders to inﬂuence later arrivals.
In the second
version of the model, we explicitly account for the se-
quential arrival of yearlings. We divide the reoccupa-
tion into n phases. At each phase, a fraction 1/n of the
newly available sites are populated and each new terri-
tory holder settles on their ﬁnal dialect before the next
phase arrives. Subsequent phases are then able to make
use of the songs of the earlier yearlings in deciding their
adult song. In each case, the decision process is identi-
cal to the single phase model, except that newly arrived
birds can “see” both the preexisting adults, and yearlings
from previous phases. In the limit n → ∞ we have the
pure sequential model, when yearlings arrive one by one,
mimicking the physical process of cooperative random
sequential adsorption [11].

III. SIMULATIONS

A.

Investigation of critical death rate

We consider ﬁrst the single phase model on a square
lattice where, initially, each site has equal probability
of containing an adult bird of each dialect. Provided
the death rate, α, is suﬃciently low, single dialect do-
mains form and grow (Figure 3). As with the kinetic
Ising model [12] evolving by Glauber dynamics [13], those
parts of domain boundaries that are locally convex tend
to shrink, whilst those that are concave tend to grow.
The overall eﬀect is one of smoothing boundaries due to
an eﬀective “surface tension” [12]. An intuitive explana-
tion of the eﬀect is that locally convex parts of dialect
domain boundaries are more likely to contain sites that
will have a majority of birds of the other dialect as neigh-
bours during the next breeding season, as illustrated in
Figure 4. The majority rule represents a non-linear re-
sponse to local dialects. In contrast, a proportional re-
sponse would be to align to a randomly chosen neighbour
as in the voter model [12, 14], so that on average dialects
would be chosen in proportion to their local frequency.
The voter model does not lead to the formation of do-
mains due to a lack of “surface tension” [14] and the im-
portance of a nonlinear learning rule has recently been
recognized in a non-spatial model [15] of bird dialects.

By increasing the death rate of adult birds, dialect con-
tinuity from year to year is reduced: a site which at the

alect will be more likely, if the death rate is high, to be
converted by random deaths into a site surrounded by
a majority of the other, or one where neither dialect is
in the majority. As a consequence there exists a crit-
ical death rate, analogous to the Curie temperature in
ferromagnets, above which domains dominated by a sin-
gle dialect cannot form. To discover the critical death
rate we introduce a correlation length, ξ, for a square
lattice of side L with periodic boundary conditions. Let-

where E[·] denotes the expectation over the equilibrium
probability distribution of system states. Due to trans-
lational invariance ξ is independent of (x, y). From its
deﬁnition we see that if the system consists of one sin-
gle large domain then ξ = L/2 and if there are no spatial
correlations between dialects at diﬀerent sites then ξ = 0.
If the equilibrium domain size is ﬁnite and less than the
system size then ξ will lie between these two values.

We have estimated ξ by initially setting each site to
state ↑ with probability 0.95, and setting α = 0.01 (in
order to avoid stripe states [16]). The system was then
allowed to reach equilibrium and the correlation length
estimated by computing the sum

around a cell. However, ﬁeld observations [5] show that
the number of neighbours available to learn from varies
between one and four, suggesting that the four neighbour
model more plausibly characterises the real system. Of
particular interest is the fact that the critical death rate
in the four neighbour model is close to the actual death
rate of the Puget Sound white crowned sparrow. Such a
death rate makes dialects only marginally stable in this
model, suggesting that the extra information provided
on local dialects to later arriving yearlings by their early
arriving counterparts may play an important role. To
quantify this eﬀect we simulated the multiple phase four
neighbour model in the cases n = 2 and n → ∞, in or-
der to determine the correlation length as a function of
death rate. The results are presented in Figure 6. We see
that in both cases the critical death rate is considerably
higher than in the single phase model, so that the ﬁeld
observed death rate α ≈ 0.4 would lead to stable dialects.

at every site in the system at a sequence of times, before
computing a spatial and time average. Following this
the death rate was incrementally increased, and the sys-
tem allowed to equilibrate before re-calculating ξ. The
results of this procedure are shown in Figure 5 for both
the four and eight neighbour versions of the model. From
the Figure we see that for suﬃciently low death rate
the system consists of a single dialect domain. However,
once α reaches a critical level the correlation length drops
rapidly indicating fragmentation into a disordered state.
The critical death rate is considerably higher in the eight
neighbour model, because a greater fraction of neigh-
bours need to die in order to change the majority dialect

Provided that α < αc then (as with the Ising model
when T < Tc) a system consisting of a single dialect is
stable against the invasion of the other song. To see this,
suppose that the dominant dialect is ↑ and consider the
fate of a closed “droplet” domain of ↓ within the system.
Due to surface tension, the droplet will evolve toward
a circular shape, which will then shrink due to its con-
vexity. Despite the fact that the single dialect state is
absorbing in the sense that the system cannot escape it,
it has been shown in the case of the Ising model, that
the system can freeze into stable states containing multi-
ple domains of opposing states [16, 17]. These stable do-
mains consist of “stripes” which, because of their straight
boundaries, lack surface tension which could shrink or ex-

IV. APPROXIMATION WITH KINETIC ISING

MODEL

Our analysis has made use of an analogy between di-
alect domains in bird populations and domains of aligned
spins in ferromagnets. We now make this connection ex-
plicit in the single phase case by deriving Ising models
with transition rates which match the expected transi-
tion rates in our dialect system. This enables us to de-
rive an approximate relationship between death rate and
thermodynamic temperature. We also demonstrate how
phased arrival of yearling birds may be viewed as extend-
ing the distance over which nearby adult dialects can be
perceived.

A. Single Phase Reoccupation

Consider the four neighbour model. Letting hx, yi de-

note the nearest neighbours of site (x, y) we deﬁne

ψ(x, y) = Xhx,yi

S(x′, y′),

(3)

where S(x′, y′) ∈ {1,−1} is the dialect at site (x′, y′) at
the end of a breeding season. We now suppose that at
the start of the following season, site (x, y) is vacant. The
yearling male occupying this site will not typically have
access to ψ(x, y) due to the non-return of one or more of
its neighbours. This disruption of information plays the
same role as temperature in the Ising model. We now
deﬁne the indicator function for the return of an adult
bird at each site

R(x, y) =(1 with prob. 1 − α

0 with prob. α.

(4)

Using this indicator, we can compute the sum of the di-
alects seen by the new territory holder at (x, y)

˜ψ(x, y) = Xhx,yi

R(x′, y′)S(x′, y′).

(5)

The yearling will chose his dialect according to the sign
of this “noisy” version of ψ(x, y). We now deﬁne the step
function

where the expectation is taken over all possible combina-

pand them. The probability that such states will form in
a rectangular system, starting from a randomized initial
condition, depends strongly on its aspect ratio. Higher
aspect ratios tends to produce multiple stripes, stretch-
ing across the short side of the system. The existence
of such “frozen” dialect states would provide a plausible
explanation for the structure of the Puget Sound white
crowned sparrow’s dialect domains, because their coastal
breeding grounds form a long strip. To investigate the
typical sizes of such domains in our dialect model we
have simulated the fully sequential version on a high as-
pect ratio rectangle (Figure 7). For large systems, when
domains become large, the dynamics of their boundaries
may be approximated with continuous curves and the ex-
plicit length scale of individual sites becomes irrelevant
[12]. In the absence of an absolute length scale only the
relative sizes of structures within the system are mean-
ingful. We may exploit this scale free property of large
systems to compare the aspect ratio of stripe domains
in our simulation to those of real dialect domains. By
coarse graining the system of Figure 7 into 10 × 10 cells,
we estimated the aspect ratios AR of single domains to
lie in the range AR ∈ [0.6, 3.5] with mean and standard
deviation µ(AR) = 1.4 and σ(AR) = 1.1. Distribution
maps [8] suggest that breeding territories of Puget Sound
white crowned sparrow spread ≈ 50km inland and com-
bined with the dialect distributions mapped in Figure
1, we predict that the aspect ratios of the real dialect
domains lie in the range AR ∈ [1, 4.3] with mean and
standard deviation µ(AR) = 2.8 and σ(AR) = 1.6. The
similarity between the simulated and observed distribu-
tions supports our hypothesis that the observed domains
arise due to the processes modeled, and are stripe states.

6

ψ ∈ {−2, 0, 2}, then any site on a domain boundary will
have a probability of changing state the next time it is
updated which is identical between the two models, given
the value of ψ. It is important to realize however that
the simultaneous updates that take place in the dialect
model introduce correlations between state ﬂips which
are not present in Glauber dynamics. Matching the val-
ues of p↑(ψ) and ω↑(ψ), we ﬁnd that

β(α) =

tanh−1(1 − 3α2 + 4α3 − 2α4).

(13)

We may now make use of the approximate analytical re-
lationship between death rate and inverse temperature
to estimate the critical death rate in the dialect model.

length ξ demonstrate that this method of prediction is
remarkably accurate in the four neighbour case (Figure
5).

For the eight neighbour model, we redeﬁne ψ(x, y) to
be the sum of the eight dialects relevant to site (x, y). In
this case

Equating this quantity with the series estimate [19, 20]
Tc ≈ 5.2599 of the critical temperature in the eight neigh-
bour Ising model we obtain

αc ≈ 0.657.

(23)

This may be compared to our simulation estimate αc ≈
0.651 (inﬂection point of (α, ξ) graph in Figure 5). Whilst
still an eﬀective estimation method, the slight reduction
in accuracy may, we suggest, be related to that fact that
not all sites on domain boundaries have identical proba-
bilities of changing state between the two models.

B. Multiple Phase Reoccupation

We now show how the phased arrival of new territory
holders may be seen to induce an extended-range interac-
tion. We consider the two phase, four neighbour model.
In this case a new territory holder may be inﬂuenced by
the states of the set of sites which lie within two lattice
steps of his territory. With reference to Figure 9 we let
ψ1, ψ2 and ψ3 be the sums of dialects in, respectively,
the set of nearest, next nearest, and next next nearest
neighbour sites of a new territory holder

ψ1 := S1 + S2 + S3 + S4
ψ1 := S5 + S6 + S7 + S8
ψ1 := S9 + S10 + S11 + S12.

(24)
(25)
(26)

We refer to these sets of sites as the ﬁrst, second and
third “rings”. If a new territory holder at site 0 is part
of the ﬁrst phase then the probability that he will select
the ↑ dialect is identical, given ψ1, to the four neighbour
single phase model. However, if he is part of the second
phase, then it is possible that currently vacant sites in the
ﬁrst ring may be occupied in the ﬁrst phase. The fate
of these ﬁrst ring sites is decided by the states of sites
in the second and third rings. Sites in even higher rings
only become relevant in higher phase models. We deﬁne
p↑(ψ1, ψ2, ψ3) to be the probability that a new territory

ψ2 and ψ3 will choose the ↑ dialect. This probability
can be computed exactly (see appendix) if we assume
that all dialect arrangements within each ring, consis-
tent with {ψi}3
i=1 are equally probable. To quantify the
importance of the second and third ring sites we have
illustrated (Figure 10) the dependence of p↑ on ψ2 and
ψ3 when the ﬁrst ring sites give equivocal information
ψ1 = 0. We see that the states of these outer–ring sites
can change p↑ by, at most, a factor of 3
2 when realistic
death rates are assumed.

By selecting dialects uniformly at

random from
the lattice and updating them using the probabilities
p↑(ψ1, ψ2, ψ3), which may be viewed as a form of Glauber
dynamics with appropriately chosen (by rather compli-
cated) Hamiltonian, we obtain the correlation length es-
timates plotted in Figure 6. From this we see that the ex-
tended range interactions induced by the phased model,
although weak, create a signiﬁcant increase in the stabil-
ity of dialect domains against death of adults.

V. CONCLUSION

Using ﬁeld data on the behaviour and songs of the
Puget Sound white crowned sparrow [5], we have devel-
oped a simple lattice model which may be used to explain
the large dialect domains which appear along its coastal
breeding grounds. We have shown that the destabilising
eﬀect of adult death, and the song matching behaviour of
yearling males may be viewed as analogous, respectively,
to thermodynamic temperature and spin-spin interac-
tions in two dimensional magnetic materials. Pursuing
this analogy we have shown how stable dialect domains
may be viewed as stripe states with similar size distribu-
tion to observed domains, we have calculated the maxi-
mum death rate for which dialects will persist (≈ 60%),
and we have shown how phased arrival of new territory
holders can signiﬁcantly increase dialect stability through

an eﬀective interaction beyond nearest neighbour terri-
tories. Birdsong dialects are widely observed and take
a variety of forms [21]; we suggest that the analogy to
ordering in physical systems may be usefully applied to
other species and potentially to the study of observed
and historical human dialect domains.

Appendix: Calculation of two phase probabilities

We show how to calculate the conditional probability
that a new territory holder in the two phase model will
choose the ↑ dialect given the ﬁrst, second and third ring
dialect sums ψ1, ψ2 and ψ3. We write this probability
p↑(ψ1, ψ2, ψ3) ≡ Pr(↑ |ψ1, ψ2, ψ3).

We adopt the site numbering in Figure 9. Let ~S =
(S1, S2, . . . S12) represent the song states at the end of the
previous breeding season, and let ~R = (R1, R2, . . . R12)
be the indicators for returning adults at the start of the
current season and ~r = (r1, r2, r3, r4) be indicators of
arriving yearlings in the ﬁrst wave to the nearest neigh-
bour sites of the origin. Let ~B = (B1, B2, B3, B4) be a
vector of Bernoulli variables Bi ∈ {−1, 1} which indicate
song decisions in these sites in the case that returning
yearlings are presented with equivocal information. We
have

α

Pr(Ri = 0 ∩ ri = 0) =
Pr(Ri = 0 ∩ ri = 1) =
Pr(Ri = 1 ∩ ri = 0) = 1 − α
Pr(Ri = 1 ∩ ri = 1) = 0

Pr(Ri = 1) = 1 − α
Pr(Ri = 0) = α.

We also deﬁne

To compute the probability p↑(ψ1, ψ2, ψ3) we condition
on the central site being empty and consider the two
possible stages at which a yearling bird can reoccupy it.

Case I: Central site reoccupied in the ﬁrst phase

of the season given that the yearling at the site returns
in the ﬁrst phase. We deﬁne

X0 :=

SkRk

Xk=1

(A.10)

then

p1(↑ |~S, ~R) = I{X0>0} +

2

I{X0=0},

(A.11)

where the indicator function IA of the event A is deﬁned

IA =(1

0

if A occurs
otherwise .

(A.12)

Case II: Central site reoccupied in the second phase

We deﬁne p2(↑ |~S, ~R, ~r, ~B) to be the probability (con-
ditional on ~S, ~R, ~r, ~B) that the central site is in the ↑
state at the end of the season given that the yearling at
the site returns in the second phase. We deﬁne

Xk := Xi∈hki

SiRi k ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}

(A.13)

where hki denotes the nearest neighbours of site k. The
random variable Xk is the sum of all states around site k
at the start of the season. The quantity that determines
the fate of the central site is the sum of the states in sites
{1, 2, 3, 4} at the end of the ﬁrst phase. Let {sk}4
k=1 (note
change of case) be these states where sk ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. If
Rk = 1 then site k is occupied by last year’s adult and
sk = Sk. If rk = 1 then the returning bird at site k is
a yearling and bases its decision on Xk. If Rk = rk = 0
then the site remains empty so sk = 0. Therefore

sk = RkSk + rk(cid:2)I{Xk >0} − I{Xk <0} + BiI{Xk =0}(cid:3) .

(A.14)

We now deﬁne

x0 :=

si,

4

Xi=1

(A.15)

then

p2(↑ |~S, ~R, ~r, ~B) = I{x0>0} +

1
2

I{x0=0}.

(A.16)

Unconditional probability

Since the central site is equally likely to be ﬁlled in the
ﬁrst or second phase, then conditional on ~S, ~R, ~r, ~B we
have

We deﬁne p1(↑ |~S, ~R) to be the probability (conditional
on ~S, ~R) that the central site is in the ↑ state at the end

Pr(↑ |~S, ~R, ~r, ~B) =

1

2hp1(↑ |~S, ~R) + p2(↑ |~S, ~R, ~r, ~B)i .

(A.17)

To compute the unconditional probability we deﬁne

fRr(u, v) = Pr(Ri = u ∩ ri = v)

fR(u) = Pr(Ri = u)

(A.18)
(A.19)

The joint probability mass function of ~R and ~r is then

f (~u, ~v) := Pr( ~R = ~u ∩ ~r = ~v)
Yk=5

fRr(uk, vk)

Yk=1

=

fR(uk).

(A.20)

(A.21)

We now assume that conditional on the values of
ψ1, ψ2, ψ3 all values of ~S are equally likely. We let S
be the set of all possible values of ~S and deﬁne

A(y1, y2, y3) =
{ ~S ∈ S|ψ1(~S) = y1, ψ2(~S) = y2, ψ3(~S) = y3}.
Since all 16 values of ~B are equally probable then

(A.22)

1

p↑(y1, y2, y3) =

16|A| X~S∈A,~u,~v, ~B

f (~u, ~v)p(↑ |~S, ~u, ~v, ~B)
(A.23)
where we have suppressed the arguments of A for nota-
tional compactness. To compute all such probabilities
requires us to sum over 232 combinations of song states
~S, arrival times ( ~R, ~r) and decision variables ~B. Using a

9

simple Python program running in parallel on ﬁve cores
of an eight core workstation this can be achieved in ap-
proximately one day. An example of the result of this
calculation is

p↑(0, 0, 2) = −

We have veriﬁed our analytical results using Monte Carlo
simulations. We note also that further veriﬁcation is pro-
vided by considering the cases α = 0 and α = 1. For
example

p↑(0, 0, 2)|α=0 = p↑(0, 0, 2)|α=1 =

(A.25)

consistent with the fact that in the limit α → 0, ev-
ery yearling has four adult neighbours and so cannot be
inﬂuenced by the outer rings, and when α = 1 all infor-
mation from the previous season is lost. For 0 < α < 1,
p↑(0, 0, 2) has a single maximum at α = 0.5677.
