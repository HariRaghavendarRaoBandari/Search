ABSTRACT

HESS J1943+213 is an unidentiﬁed TeV source that is likely a high-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL) object
but also compatible with a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) nature. Each of these enormously diﬀerent astronomical
interpretations is supported by some of the observed unusual characteristics. In order to ﬁnally classify and
understand this object we took a three-pronged approach, through time-domain, high angular resolution, and
multi-frequency radio studies. First, our deep time-domain observations with the Arecibo telescope failed
to uncover the putative pulsar powering the proposed PWN. We conclude with ∼70% certainty that HESS
J1943+213 does not host a pulsar. Second, long-baseline interferometry of the source with e-MERLIN at 1.5-
and 5- GHz, shows only a core, a point source at ∼ 1 – 100 milli-arcsecond resolution. Its 2013 ﬂux density
is about one-third lower than detected in 2011 observations with similar resolution. This radio variability
of the core strengthens the HBL object hypothesis. More evidence against the PWN scenario comes, third,
from the radio spectrum we compiled. The extended structure follows a power-law behavior with spectral
index α = −0.54 ± 0.04 while the core component is ﬂat spectrum (α = −0.03 ± 0.03).
In contrast, the
radio synchrotron emission of PWNe predicts a single power-law distribution. Overall we rule out the PWN
hypothesis and conclude the source is a BL Lac object. The consistently high fraction (70%) of the ﬂux density
from the extended structure then leads us to conclude that HESS J1943+213 must be a non-classical HBL
object.

1. INTRODUCTION

The unidentiﬁed γ-ray source HESS J1943+213 is intrigu-
ing because of its low Galactic latitude (−1.◦29). It could be
the ﬁrst BL Lac object to be observed through the Galactic
plane. Proving on the other hand that HESS J1943+213 is a
pulsar wind nebula (PWN), residing in a supernova remnant
(SNR) shell at the outer edge of our Galaxy, could help solve
the long-standing problem of the missing Galactic SNRs.
With a Galactic supernova rate of one per 30− 50 years (Tam-
mann et al. 1994), and a remnant radio-lifetime average of
≥ 6× 104 years (Frail et al. 1994), there should be ∼ 1.6× 103
SNRs at any given time. In reality the detected SNRs make
up only ∼18% of this number (Green 2014).
HESS J1943+213 was ﬁrst discovered as the hard X-ray
source IGRD J19443+2117 by Landi et al. (2009) with IN-
TEGRAL. Landi et al. (2009) identiﬁed the source in sev-
eral wavelength bands.
In the X- and γ-rays and in the
infrared (IR; J-, H-, and K-band) it corresponds to the
source 2MASS J1943562+2118233, and in radio at 1.4 GHz
to NVSS J194356+211826. A power law was ﬁtted to the IN-
TEGRAL data in the 0.9− 100 keV energy band, which pro-

vides evidence for absorption in excess of the Galactic value
and a slope typical to the spectral indices of an active galac-
tic nucleus (AGN). The source is highly absorbed in the IR J,
H, and K band, which gives an E(B−V) also in excess of the
Galactic value. The excess of Galactic absorption provides
evidence for the source’s extragalactic nature and in combi-
nation with the X-, γ-rays and radio data, Landi et al. (2009)
propose HESS J1943+213 is a radio-quiet AGN.

In order to localize and determine the nature of the source,
IGR J19443+2117 was followed up in X-rays with Chan-
dra (Tomsick et al. 2009). Chandra’s higher positional ac-
curacy conﬁrmed the association between the X-ray, IR and
radio sources. An absorbing column density signiﬁcantly
= 0.84/0.054) pro-
higher than the Galactic value (NH/NH2
vided more evidence for the extragalactic source nature.
In
2011 the source was discovered to also emit at TeV energies
(H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. 2011; Cerruti 2011), as HESS
J1943+213.
Its detection at very high energies (VHE) to-
gether with its ﬂat radio spectrum shown by H.E.S.S. Col-
laboration et al. (2011) make it plausible that the source is a
PWN. Many unresolved VHE Galactic sources turn out to be
PWNe1. Although the source has now been observed at mul-
tiple energies and wavelengths, its nature remained unclear.

Two plausible scenarios remain for the nature of this source.
It
is either a high-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL) ob-
ject, evidenced by its TeV emission and soft VHE spectrum
(H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. 2011), or it could be a Galactic
PWN (e.g. H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. 2011; Gab´anyi et al.
2013) which is supported by the lack of variability (Shahinyan
et al. 2015). H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. (2011) also pro-
posed that the source could be a gamma-ray binary, how-
ever, this scenario was quickly discarded because no massive
companion was detected to a distance limit of ∼25 kpc. This

would place the potential binary outside our Galaxy, making it
100− 1000 times brighter in X-rays than any known gamma-
ray binary. In support, the observed 10s of arcseconds to ∼ 1-
arcminute-scale radio structure (Gab´anyi et al. 2013) cannot
be explained by colliding winds the binary would produce.
The lower limit of the distance of 16 kpc derived by HI ab-
sorption favours its extragalactic nature (Leahy & Tian 2012),
but is inconclusive, because Vall´ee (2008) shows that the fur-
thest spiral arm of the Milky Way reaches distances greater
than 20 kpc. However, the soft TeV spectrum, Γ = 3.1 ± 0.5,
is softer than of all known PWNe (Kargaltsev & Pavlov 2010)
and argues in favour of the blazar hypothesis (H.E.S.S. Col-
laboration et al. 2011). Also, Peter et al. (2014) interpret the
K-band counterpart to be a massive elliptical galaxy, with
only 10% chance it being a star and found a weak 5.1σ de-
tection above 1 GeV of the counterpart of HESS J1943+213
in 5 years of Fermi data. This supports the blazar hypoth-
esis as most of the blazars are detected by Fermi (Piner &
Edwards 2014). Recent VERITAS observations, conducted
by Shahinyan et al. (2015), show no brightness variability,
however, BL Lac objects are known for their wide range in
variability time-scales and intensities. Despite the evidence
for its BL Lac nature, the radio spectral index obtained by
H.E.S.S. Collaboration et al. (2011) is also compatible with
the PWN scenario. Supportingly, Piner & Edwards (2014) ar-
gue that the brightness of the source in TeV is two orders in
magnitude too low to be a HBL object, which would leave the
PWN scenario as the only plausible scenario.

1.1. PWN hypothesis

The PWN hypothesis is strengthened after the re-analysis
of archival VLA large-scale HI data (VGPS; Stil et al. 2006)
in Gab´anyi et al. (2013). These data revealed the presence
of a shell-like feature of ∼ 1°diameter, the radio/X-ray/TeV
point source near its center(see Fig. 3, Gab´anyi et al. 2013).
This shell-like feature can be interpreted as a consequence a
supernova explosion where the central compact source is the
PWN, powered by a young pulsar. The expansion suggests the
supernova explosion to have occurred 4 × 105 yrs ago. Indeed,
if one puts the Crab or 3C58 PWNe at the proposed distance
of 17 kpc (Gab´anyi et al. 2013) they would appear the same
size as HESS J1943+213 seen in the archival VLA data. We
then expect the young, energetic pulsar powering the PWN
to have a period of 30–300 ms. At the proposed distance, the
dispersion measure (DM) would be of order 500 pc cm−3 in
this line of sight (from NE2001, Cordes & Lazio 2002).

1.2. BL Lac hypothesis

In 2011, Gab´anyi et al. (2013) performed EVN (European
VLBI Network) observations of the source at 1.6 GHz and
found the radio counterpart of the high-energy source at
an oﬀset of 3.(cid:48)(cid:48)75 to the NVSS catalog coordinates. The
recovered ﬂux density was 31±3 mJy, which is only one-third
of the ﬂux density (95 ± 9 mJy) recovered simultaneously
with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT).
This latter corresponds well to the ﬂux density obtained from
archival data of the Very Large Array (VLA) taken at 1.4
GHz on 1985 September 30 (project: AH196) and thus shows
a discrepancy in ﬂux density between the separate angular
scales. Using these observations to compare to, we will
discuss the proposed BL Lac nature of the source by imaging
the source in order to further investigate its sub-arcsecond
radio structure.

In this paper we present new time-domain, high-resolution
imaging, and continuum investigations of HESS J1943+213
(hereafter J1943+213). In Sect. 2 we describe the observa-
tions and data reduction of all three studies. Section 3 con-
tains our ﬁndings. We discuss these results in Sect. 4 before
concluding, in Sect. 5, on the nature of this intriguing source.

2. OBSERVATIONS

In order to investigate the nature of the source we took a
three-pronged approach. To determine if the source is a PWN,
we have performed high-time resolution observations with the
Arecibo radio telescope to ﬁnd the putative pulsar powering
the PWN. These will be addressed ﬁrst. Secondly, we inves-
tigate any sub-arcsecond-scale radio structures of the source
for which we have obtained e-MERLIN (electronic Multi-
Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network) observa-
tions. Finally, we discuss ﬂux density measurements obtained
by the new survey VLITE (VLA Low Band Ionospheric and
Transient Experiment, Clarke et al. 2016, in preparation). To-
gether with survey catalog ﬂux density measurements, this
low-frequency observation at 340 MHz will provide informa-
tion on the continuum spectrum which in turn could help to
rule out either the proposed PWN or BL Lac object scenario.

2.1. Pulsar search

Arecibo, with its 305-m diameter, is the largest single-dish
telescope in the world. Combined with its broadband ob-
serving capabilities it provides instantaneous sensitivity and
is highly suitable for pulsar searches. The source J1943+213
was observed in two frequency bands to improve the chance
of detecting the putative pulsar, given the various frequency-

dependent eﬀects.
shell, it is expected to be at a distance of ∼17 kpc (Gab´anyi
et al. 2013). The free electrons in the line of sight create a
dispersive time delay in the putative pulsar signal which is
proportional to f −2, where f is the observing frequency. This
delay is expressed through the dispersion measure (DM), the
density of free electrons integrated over distance in the line of
sight, given in pc cm−3. Observing at higher frequencies al-
lows for less dispersive time delay, which increases the signal-
to-noise (S/N) ratio of a pulsar signal. Beyond this dispersion,
the signal will suﬀer from scattering which is proportional to
f −4. Scattering stretches the pulse shape, also resulting in a
reduction of the S/N ratio. These two eﬀects make observing
at low frequencies a challenge.

In contrast, pulsars are known to have a steep power spec-
trum towards low frequencies, mostly peaking in the range of
200−400 MHz. As the pulsar signal is stronger towards lower
frequencies, observing at lower frequencies is a boon. It might
enable the detection of the pulsar where at higher frequencies
it would be too weak. However, taking the above mentioned
eﬀects into account, observing below 1.4 GHz might smear
out most of the signal for a far away, high-DM pulsar.

2.1.1. Observations with Arecibo

Arecibo was pointed to the

radio counterpart of
HESS J1943+213, NVSS J194356+211826 (Landi et al.
2009) on 2012 June 1. The source was observed in the
L-wide band around 1.44 GHz and in the S-wide band
around 2.85 GHz with the Arecibo Mock spectrometers in
single-pixel mode. The ﬁeld-of-view (FoV) for the pointing
in the L-wide band was 3.(cid:48)1 × 3.(cid:48)5, and in the S-wide band
1.(cid:48)8 × 2.(cid:48)0. In the L-wide band we observed for 54 minutes

with a large total bandwidth of 688 MHz. This is more than
twice as large as the PALFA Survey bandwidth of 300 MHz
(Knispel et al. 2011). The PALFA Survey is the Arecibo
L-band Feed Array 1.4 GHz Survey for radio Pulsars, which
is currently the most sensitive survey of the Galactic plane.
In the S-wide band we observed using a slightly smaller
bandwidth of 494 MHz for 69 minutes. More observing
details can be found in Table 1.

2.1.2. Data reduction

The obtained data were streamed to the Cartesius super
computer at SURFsara2. There it was converted from 16-bit
to 8-bit data, and the Mock subbands were combined. The
resulting PSRFITS ﬁles were further analysed with the pulsar
search software PRESTO (Ransom 2001). Radio frequency
interference (RFI) was masked out of the data. The L-wide
data were searched for periodic signals in the DM range from
0 to 1000 pc cm−3, which is twice the expected DM value (see
Sect. 1.1). The DM range was searched starting with steps
of 0.05 pc cm−3 and no down-sampling, up to steps of 0.30
pc cm−3 and a down-sampling factor of 4. The candidate sig-
nals were sorted on their S/N ratio and searched down to a de-
tection limit of 4.1σ, equivalent to χ2 ∼ 1.90. These detection
limits, as output by PRESTO, signify how much the candi-
date signal deviates from a straight line. The same DM range
was searched in S-wide with steps of 1.00 pc cm−3 and no
down-sampling. Here we could aﬀord to search using larger
DM steps, because the frequency dependent smearing is less
at higher frequencies. Further analysis was performed follow-
ing the same steps, where in S-wide all candidate signals were
inspected.

For every DM step in both bands, we also looked for single
pulses of widths between 0.064 and 10 ms, down to a S/N =
8.

2.2. e-MERLIN radio imaging and data reduction

Radio imaging data were obtained by e-MERLIN, which is
a UK-based long baseline interferometry array using six 25-
m dishes with the optional inclusion of the Lovell telescope
(76 m diameter). The total network can reach a resolution of
150 milli-arcseconds (mas) in the L-band (1.5 GHz).

The e-MERLIN observations were obtained at 1.5- and 5-
GHz (project CY1017; Gab´anyi et al. 2015). The 1.5- GHz
observation took place on 2013 December 7 and lasted for
12 hours. From the total observing time, approximately 6 h
was on-source time. Unfortunately, the self-calibration did
not provide meaningful solutions in the ﬁrst few hours of the
observation and only ∼ 4.3 h could be used for the imaging
of the source. The phase calibrator was J1946+2300. The
5-GHz observation had to be split in three 4.5-h long runs,
because due to maintenance, the Jodrell Bank MkII telescope
could only participate in observations during the night in Oc-
tober 2013. The three runs were carried out between 2013

2 https://www.surfsara.nl/nl/systems/cartesius

October 11 and 14. To cover the missing hour angles, two ad-
ditional runs were carried out on 2014 June 12 and 13. Except
for the last run, when MkII was not involved in the observa-
tion, all e-MERLIN telescopes participated. The on-source
time was approximately 13-h. The phase-reference calibrator
was J1925+2106.

Data reduction was done using the National Radio As-
tronomy Observatory (NRAO) Astronomical Image Process-
ing System (AIPS, Greisen 2003), following the e-MERLIN
cookbook version 2.4a.

2.3. VLITE data reduction

The National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s Very Large
Array (VLA) is a 27-antenna interferometer operating be-
tween 56 MHz and 50 GHz (Perley et al. 2011). We obtained
data from a new commensal observing system on the VLA
called the VLA Low Band Ionospheric and Transient Experi-
ment (VLITE). This system records data for a 64 MHz band-
width of the low-band receiver (Clarke et al. 2011) centered at
352 MHz for 10 VLA antennas (Clarke et al. 2016, in prepa-
ration). The correlator is a custom DiFX correlator (Deller
et al. 2011) operating in real time on the VLITE data stream.
Science operations began in November 2014 and VLITE data
have been recorded for nearly all pointed VLA observations
with primary science programs above 1 GHz since that time.
We searched the VLITE archive and found observations with
J1943+213 within the ﬁeld of view for two separate observa-
tions on 2014 December 4. The observations were split across
two phase centers for a combined observing time of 11.1 min-
utes.

The VLITE data were calibrated following standard reduc-
tion procedures with each observation processed separately
before combining the ﬁnal images. RFI was excised using
automated routines. Additional ﬁxed ﬂags were applied to re-
move known bright RFI and aliasing in the 360 − 384 MHz
portion of the spectrum. Next the data were corrected for de-
lay oﬀsets followed by an initial round of calibration. Ad-
ditional ﬂagging was undertaken following that calibration
and a second round of calibration was applied. For our tar-
get source, the ﬂux density calibration used 3C286 and 3C48
to set the scale. We have converted measured ﬂux densities to
the scale of the other measurements using the known scaling
for the ﬂux density calibrators.

Following calibration we attempted to undertake phase self-
calibration of the data but found too little ﬂux density in the
ﬁeld to improve the phase solution of the data. Each of the in-
dividual pointings was convolved to a matched circular beam
(52(cid:48)(cid:48)) and then corrected for primary beam attenuation using
a recently derived VLITE primary beam appropriate for the
VLA subreﬂector position of the observations. The two point-
ings were then combined in the image plane for a ﬁnal image
which has an rms of 36.2 mJy beam−1.
3. RESULTS

3.1. Pulsar search

The Arecibo instrument and software setup was veriﬁed
by observing three known, bright pulsars (PSRs B1937+21,
B1953+29, B2016+28) in nearby directions in the sky. All
were easily detected (cf. Fig. 1).
Our sensitive search of J1943+213 resulted in ∼2000 candi-
date signals in L-wide and ∼1500 candidate signals in S-wide.
All these candidate signals were inspected by eye, where we
focused on a clean pulse proﬁle as seen in the top left of Fig. 1

pulsars in the ATNF pulsar database (Manchester et al. 2005).
We ﬁnd we were sensitive to signals of 1.90 µJy in L-wide
and of 1.45 µJy in S-wide. The pseudo luminosity, L = S d2,
that accounts for the distance, is 0.55 mJy kpc2 (L-wide) and
0.42 mJy kpc2 (S-wide) for the assumed distance of d=17 kpc.
This is 3− ∼300 times more sensitive than the luminosity of
88% of all known pulsars in a PWN.
Next to the search for periodic pulsar signals described
above, we have also conducted a single-pulse search. Such
a search is sensitive to pulsars that emit only irregularly. We
identiﬁed all 3000 single pulses with S/N ratios above 8, in
both bands, and evaluated how their DM versus time signa-
ture compared to the shape expected for a pulsar (D. Michilli,
priv. comm.). For the best 30 candidates we looked for the dis-
persed pulse curve in the high time-resolution dynamic spec-
trum, which would be characteristic of a pulsar. We did not
ﬁnd any such single pulses.

3.2. e-MERLIN imaging

The e-MERLIN data reduction resulted in an unresolved
point source at both frequencies, as shown in Fig. 2. None
show any large-scale feature visible down to a 7σ level
(0.34 mJy beam−1) in the 23(cid:48)(cid:48) × 23(cid:48)(cid:48) L-band FoV. Brightness
distribution models were ﬁt to the visibilities with Difmap
(Shepherd et al. 1994) and we found that single, circular,
Gaussian components best describe the source at both fre-
quencies. The emission has a ﬂux density of 22.2±0.7 mJy
at 1.5 GHz and of 22.4±0.3 mJy at 5 GHz. If we assume that
the source did not show variability between the observations
taken at the two frequencies, J1943+213 has a ﬂat spectrum.
Since the 5-GHz observations were split into several chunks,
we were able to compare the source ﬂux density in the dif-
ferent observing runs to check for ﬂux density variability.
Speciﬁcally we did self-calibration and imaging with using
the ﬁrst 13.5 hours, which were observed on three consecutive
days in 2013 October. Separate self-calibration and imaging
were done with using only the observations performed in 2014
June. We did not detect signiﬁcant variability between these
two epochs.

On the other hand, in the L-band J1943+213 was signiﬁ-
cantly fainter during the e-MERLIN observation in 2013 De-
cember compared to the EVN L-band observation in 2011
May (Gab´anyi et al. 2013).

3.3. Radio continuum spectrum of J1943+213

The radio continuum spectrum of J1943+213 is obtained
by combining several radio survey ﬂux density measurements
of the source and measurements from observations pointed to
the NVSS source, which is the accepted radio counterpart of
J1943+213.

3.3.1. Flux density measurements from radio surveys

The VLITE observations detect a source at the NVSS po-
sition with almost 8-σ signiﬁcance. The ﬂux densities at
340 MHz are 0.23±0.5 Jy and 0.36±0.07 Jy integrated. From
the ﬁt, the structure appears slightly extended (56(cid:48)(cid:48)) com-
pared to the 52(cid:48)(cid:48)×52(cid:48)(cid:48)resolution. The reported extension is
only marginally larger than the beam size, thus it is unclear
if the source is resolved, and we therefore have chosen to use
the peak ﬂux density which is appropriate for an unresolved
source.

The source is also detected by the re-reduction of the
VLA low-frequency Sky Survey (VLSSr, Lane et al. 2014) at

Figure 1. This ﬁgure shows the detected pulse signal of the test pulsar
B1953+29 observed in the S-wide band as output by PRESTO. The left-hand
side shows the cumulative pulse signal and its progression in time. The right-
hand side shows (upper) the pulse signal as a function of frequency where
the white stripe is masked-out radio frequency interference (RFI). The right-
bottom side displays the strength of the pulsar signal as a function of disper-
sion measure (pc cm−3).
and a peak in the detected DM, as seen on the bottom right of
the same ﬁgure. A peak in the DM indicates that the sig-
nal originates from a speciﬁc location. The bottom left graph
shows the intensity of the pulse proﬁle as a function of phase
and time, which for a single pulsar should look similar to that
of the shown test pulsar. No candidate signal down to a detec-
tion limit of χ2=1.90 and 4.1 σ appeared to be a pulsar. For
an indication of the thoroughness of these limits, we compare
to the PALFA survey. There, the ten most recent detections
were on average χ2 = 8, and 23 σ. More speciﬁcally the ﬁve
weakest pulsars in our expected period regime (30 ms ≤ P ≤
300 ms) have χ2= 2.12 – 4.73 and σ= 6.1 – 14.7. These would
all have been handily detected.

To determine the corresponding ﬂux density limits, we use
the modiﬁed radiometer equation (Eq. 1, after Dewey et al.
1985):

(cid:114)

(cid:112)npol × τ × BW

Tsys

S min =

(1)

In our observations we searched down to S/N = 6 in L-wide
and S/N = 4 in S-wide. The gain of Arecibo is 10.5 K Jy−1
for L-wide and slightly less (9.5 K Jy−1) for S-wide. The
frequency-dependent system temperature (Tsys) is 25 K in L-
wide and 32 K in S-wide.
In both bands we recorded both
polarization directions (npol = 2). The bandwidth (BW), ex-
pressed in Hz, and observing time (τ) in seconds, are given
in Table 1. W and P are the pulse width and rotation period
of the pulsar, respectively. Together, (W/P) provide the duty
cycle of the pulsar signal (i.e. the ’on’-time of a pulsar). Be-
cause W and P are unknown when searching for a new pulsar,
we use the average W50/P = 0.071 duty cycle over all PWN

73.8 MHz. The source however did not end up in the VLSSr
catalog due to a 5-σ cutoﬀ. Careful data reduction shows that
the source is detected with a detection signiﬁcance just below
4 σ. The smaller-than-5-σ detection is strengthened by the
spatial match (within 23(cid:48)(cid:48)) to the NVSS source. The source
is unresolved by the 75(cid:48)(cid:48) × 75(cid:48)(cid:48) beam of VLSSr. The 73.8-
MHz ﬂux density obtained is 0.37 ± 0.09 Jy where we have
corrected for clean bias and included a 12% ﬂux density scale
uncertainty.

Finally, the radio counterpart of J1943+213 is also detected
at higher radio frequencies. We ﬁnd a detection of J1943+213
in the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Galactic Plane Survey
(AMIGPS, Perrott et al. 2015) at 15.7 GHz, well within the
∼ 5(cid:48)(cid:48)error circle of AMIGPS. With its 3(cid:48)resolution, the source
is detected as a point source with a ﬂux density of 23.5±3 mJy.

3.3.2. Radio continuum spectrum

Our radio ﬂux densities, obtained from radio surveys and
pointed observations, are listed in Table 2. The ﬂux density
measurements have been brought to the absolute ﬂux den-
sity scale using the VLA formula with 1999.2 coeﬃcients,
and the WSRT ﬂux density measurements using Perley-Butler
time dependent coeﬃcients. These are sorted by observ-
ing band and thereafter by observing epoch to facilitate the
identiﬁcation of variability in time. To also distinguish be-
tween various spatial scales, we list the beam sizes (full
width at half-maximum, FWHM). These beam sizes are next
shown in Fig. 3, centered on the NVSS catalog coordinates
of J1943+213. For the sake of clarity the large, highly elon-
gated Nanc¸ay Radio Telescope (NRT) beam (H.E.S.S. Col-
laboration et al. 2011) is omitted. Also overplotted is the
1.(cid:48)1 × 0.(cid:48)8 extended radio structure detected by the VLA at
1.4 GHz (Gab´anyi et al. 2013). Figure 3 shows which obser-
vations can be expected to resolve the extended radio struc-
ture. Both AMIGPS and VLSSr see J1943+213 as a point
source. Given its match to the structure size, the VLITE beam
may or may not marginally resolve the source.

The observations of J1943+213 can be sorted in two groups
based on the structure size each observation was able to probe.

Eight observations are able to see the extended structure of
J1943+213 (shown in the two left panels of Fig. 3). The
other group (EVN and e-MERLIN) is only able to observe
the mas-scale structures which we hereafter call the core. The
observations were unable to measure small-scale structures
larger than 2(cid:48)(cid:48), limited by the maximum angular scale that e-
MERLIN can recover in the L-band. The right panel of Fig. 3
is a magniﬁcation of the left panel by a factor of approxi-
mately 700. The EVN and e-MERLIN observations were un-
able to probe the observed VLA structure. In Fig. 4 we plot
the obtained ﬂux densities against their observed frequency.
We then ﬁt power laws ( fx = bxα, where b is the oﬀset and
α the index) to each of the two above mentioned groups. Ob-
servations sensitive to the sum of the extended structure plus
the core follow a power law with index α = −0.54± 0.04. Al-
though the small-scale structure appears to be variable in time
(see Section 3.2), the ﬂux density variability falls well within
the error bars of the larger-scale ﬂux density measurements
and therefore we do not expect to be able to detect variabil-
ity in the large-scale structure. The smaller-scale observations
that resolved out the extended structure show a ﬂat radio spec-
trum. Although we observed variability between the 2011
EVN observation and the 2013 e-MERLIN observation, we
ﬁt a power law to all observing epochs in order to obtain the
average spectral index α = −0.03 ± 0.03. As visible in Fig. 4,
this ﬂat core spectrum completely accounts for the AMIGPS
ﬂux density; there is no 16-GHz extended-structure emission.

4. DISCUSSION

4.1. PWN hypothesis

Our Arecibo observations would be able to detect 88% of
all known pulsars in a PWN, placed at the assumed distance of
∼17 kpc for J1943+213, and if beamed towards us. Ravi et al.
(2010) show that the radio beaming fraction of γ-ray pulsars is
close to unity for the highest energetic pulsars and goes down
to ∼0.5 for lower-energetic γ-ray pulsars. From the ATNF
pulsar catalog (Manchester et al. 2005) we obtain that three-
quarters of the pulsars in a PWN emit at high energies (i.e. X-
rays and γ-rays). They are also amongst the highest energetic

pulsars and are thus expected to have a large beaming fraction.
This means they are observable over a large range of lines of
sight. Using the observationally deduced beaming fraction
average of 0.75 ± 0.25 and our obtained sensitivity, we can
conclude with 0.7 ± 0.2 certainty that there is no pulsar in
this source and it is therefore not a PWN. In support, we ﬁnd
that the radio continuum emission can be best described by
two components, whereas the radio synchrotron emission of
PWNe is described by a single power-law distribution with
typical indices between −0.3 and 0 (Gaensler et al. 2006).
In principle, a two-component radio continuum emission
could also be explained by a composite type SNR, where
PWN is immersed in a faint SNR shell. This is seen in e.g.
the composite SNR G292.0+1.8 (Gaensler & Wallace 2003),
where the contrast in surface brightness between the core and
the surrounding plateau is one order of magnitude, and the re-
spective spectral indices are α = −0.05 and α = −0.5. There
is, however, a discrepancy in scale: if one were to observe
G292.0+1.8 and similar composite SNRs (G0.9+0.1 Dubner
et al. (2008); HESS J1818-154 H. E. S. S. Collaboration et al.
(2014); or LMC 0540-69.3 Brantseg et al. (2014)) at the as-
sumed distance to J1943+213 of 17 kpc, they would be a fac-
tor of ∼ 103 larger than observed for J1943+213. Also, in the
known sources, the SNR/PWN size ratio is 2.2 – 7.5, whereas
for J1943+213 this ratio would be approximately 4×103. This
would imply that the expansion of the SNR is orders of mag-
nitude larger than that of the PWN. Overall it appears highly
unlikely that J1943+213 is a SNR of the composite type.

tions plotted against their observed frequency. The observations of VLSSr,
VLITE, NRT, NVSS, VLA, WSRT, and AMIGPS probe the sum of the ex-
tended structure and core component. The e-MERLIN and EVN observations
only probe the core component (see Fig. 3). The epochs for the L-band EVN
and e-MERLIN observations are shown, to indicate the variability between
both observations. The blue dash-dotted line is the power-law ﬁt to the ﬂux
densities of the extended structure and core component. The green, dashed
line is the power-law ﬁt to the core component ﬂux density measurements.

4.2. Blazar hypothesis

The compactness of the source and the observed radio ﬂux
density variability agree with the proposed BL Lac nature of
the source. Observations of J1943+213 taken 2014 Novem-
ber with EVN at 1.6 GHz reveal a complex core-jet morphol-
ogy (Akiyama et al. 2016). The core brightness-temperature
lower limit of 1.8 × 109 K is consistent with a BL Lac.
Akiyama et al.
(2016) recover 42 mJy of ﬂux density, 10
mJy higher than found in our EVN observation 2011, con-
ﬁrming the source variability. Compared to the low-resolution
observations signiﬁcant amounts of ﬂux density remain miss-
ing. The large-scale emission observed by the VLA in 1985
and again conﬁrmed by the WSRT observation during our
EVN run in 2011, seems to be resolved out in the EVN and
e-MERLIN observations. Compared to the WSRT, archival
VLA, NRT and NVSS values, approximately 70 mJy ﬂux den-
sity is missing at L-band. This cannot be explained by source-
intrinsic changes, since the WSRT measurement was obtained
as part of our EVN observation and thus has to come from the
large-scale emission.

BL Lac objects are a sub-class of blazars in which the
spectral energy distribution (SED) is dominated by the emis-
sion from a relativistic jet pointing close to our line of sight
(Urry & Padovani 1995). In the radio, we witness a highly
variable emission, compact on mas scales just like in ﬂat-
spectrum quasars.
In the optical regime, however, a strik-
ing diﬀerence is the lack of broad emission lines. This is
believed to be the result of the diﬀerent nature of the accre-
tion ﬂows: quasars having a geometrically thin but optically
thick accretion disc and accrete close to critical Eddington
rates, while BL Lacs accrete at a much lower rate through a
thick accretion disc and are radiatively ineﬃcient (Maraschi
& Tavecchio 2003; Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2008). Therefore,
instead of the classical distinction between the two classes
based on the equivalent width of their emission lines, a physi-
cally more motivated approach is the division by the Edding-
ton luminosity of the broad-line regions with a division line
LBLR/LEdd < 5 × 10−4(Ghisellini et al. 2011). One may ex-
pect then that at the lower end of BL Lac accretion rates, the
SED of the galaxy will not necessarily be dominated by the
relativistic jet from the active nucleus, and the radio emis-
sion from the Doppler-boosted jet base, optically thick to syn-
chrotron emission in the radio (resulting the ﬂat spectrum and
mas-scale compact structure) may not necessarily dominate
over the large-scale radio emission.
Indeed, Giroletti et al.
(2004, 2006) have shown for low-redshift (z <0.2) BL Lac ob-
jects selected from ﬂux density limited samples in the radio,
have weak radio cores and a variety of radio morphologies
on kpc scales (jets, halos, secondary compact components).
The properties of local BL Lacs are found to be in fact simi-
lar to their Fanaroﬀ–Riley type I (Fanaroﬀ & Riley 1974) ra-
dio galaxy parent population. Further to this, a sample of 42
low-redshift (z <0.2) BL Lac objects, selected based on their
broad-band properties (with no constraints on their radio and
gamma-ray emission), revealed a number of “non-classical”
BL Lacs that have low source compactness, core dominance,
and/or show no γ-ray emission and have steep radio spectra
(Liuzzo et al. 2013). From combining observations of sur-
veys and pointed observations we ﬁnd that the radio contin-
uum emission of the extended structure follows a steep power
law with spectral index α = −0.54 ± 0.04. At ∼16 GHz the
contribution of the extended structure to the total emission
becomes almost negligible as can be seen in Fig. 4. The mea-

7
sured ﬂux density at ∼16 GHz agrees well with the expected
ﬂux density for the ﬂat-spectrum (α = −0.03 ± 0.03) core.
Our obtained index for the extended structure agrees well with
the index (αR = −0.59 ± 0.16) that the H.E.S.S. Collabora-
tion et al. (2011) obtained from their NRT observations, but
is somewhat steeper than the obtained index of αR = −0.39
from archival observations of the source at positions that dif-
fer 1.(cid:48)(cid:48)7−40(cid:48)(cid:48)of the NVSS catalog coordinates. This can be
attributed to the fact that we only take measurements into ac-
count from which we can conﬁrm the spatial match to the
NVSS source, which might not be the case for some of the
nine archival observations used by H.E.S.S. Collaboration
et al. (2011). The high-energy spectrum of J1943+213 also
corresponds well with the HBL object hypothesis. Peter et al.
(2014) computed a ﬁt for the spectral energy distribution from
radio up to TeV energies. The spectrum can be well described
by a self-synchroton model with a black-body component for
the host galaxy (see Fig. 7 in Peter et al. 2014). The radio
ﬂuxes listed in Table 2 correspond well to the model provided
by Peter et al. (2014). When limiting only to the ﬂux den-
sities attributed to the core structure (typically the dominant
emission component in HBL objects), we ﬁnd that these even
agree better with the ﬁt than the single NVSS radio point Peter
et al. (2014) used.

One may conclude that the compact radio emission in
HESS J1943+213 might represent another “non-classical” BL
Lac related low-power AGN activity in a low-redshift galaxy.
We note however that this would still be an extreme case, with
the lowest core dominance ever witnessed in a BL Lac object
(only ∼ 30% ﬂux density in the core). Other diﬀerences are
that the extent of the extended radio emission is larger (∼ 1(cid:48);
but the redshift and therefore the linear size is not known),
and that there is no apparent connection found yet between
the mas-scale core and the diﬀuse radio emission, in spite of
our attempt to reveal it with e-MERLIN that is sensitive to
structures between ∼100 mas to 2(cid:48)(cid:48).
Peter et al. (2014) gave a possible redshift interval for
the source as 0.03 ≤ z ≤ 0.45. Using these values
and assuming a standard ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology (H0 =
67.3 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.315, Planck Collaboration et al.
2014), the extended 1-arcmin structure seen in the archival
VLA image can be translated into a linear size of 38 kpc −
358 kpc. Additionally, we can set a lower size limit for the
extended feature of 2 arcsec from our L-band e-MERLIN ob-
servation. This translates into 1.3 kpc − 11.9 kpc. Thus the
extended structure of J1943+213 responsible for the ∼ 70 mJy
ﬂux density missing from the EVN observation should be be-
tween 1.3 kpc and 36 kpc in linear size, if the source is close,
at a redshift of z = 0.03, or between 11.9 kpc and 349 kpc
in linear size, if the source is more distant at a redshift of
z = 0.45. However, since the source is at low Galactic lat-
itude (−1.◦29), it cannot be discarded that there is a chance
alignment along the line of sight of a Galactic non-thermal
source, our “large-scale” structure, and the compact presum-
ably extragalactic source, implying that HESS J1943+213 is
a core-dominated BL Lac object without extended structure.

5. CONCLUSION

In order to classify HESS J1943+213, we have presented
imaging and time-domain observations. Our non-detection of
a pulsar in the time-domain observations allows us to con-
clude with ∼70% probability that there is no pulsar in this
source. Together with the two components with diﬀerent
power-law radio spectra we obtain from the radio continuum

8

S.M. Straal et al.

ﬂux densities of the source, which is unlikely to represent
an immersed PWN in a SNR shell, and previous arguments
against the PWN scenario such as the overly soft X-ray spec-
trum, we conclude that the source is not a PWN.

The HBL object classiﬁcation is further strengthened by
our new e-MERLIN imaging observations and the radio con-
tinuum spectrum we obtain from ﬂux density measurements
of surveys (e.g. VLITE and VLSSr) and pointed observa-
tions. From the continuum spectrum and our observations
with diﬀerent angular resolutions we ﬁnd that the object can
be best described by two structures: an extended structure
with a somewhat steep spectrum (α = −0.54 ± 0.04) and
a ﬂat-spectrum core with α = −0.03 ± 0.03. Such a struc-
ture is common to BL Lac objects. Quite striking however is
the large 70% ﬂux density fraction originating from the ex-
tended structure, unseen in typical HBL objects. We con-
clude that HESS J1943+213 is most likely a non-classical
high-frequency peaked BL Lac object. Alternatively, since
the source is at low Galactic latitude, we cannot rule out that
the compact emission is of extragalactic origin while the ex-
tended emission is from the Galaxy in the same the line of
sight and is physically unrelated to the compact component.
