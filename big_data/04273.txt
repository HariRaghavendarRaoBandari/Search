Experimentally and mysteriously, the concentration of quasiparticles in a gapped superconductor
at low temperatures always by far exceeds its equilibrium value. We study the dynamics of localized
quasiparticles in superconductors with a spatially ﬂuctuating gap edge. The competition between
phonon-induced quasiparticle recombination and generation by a weak non-equilibrium agent results
in an upper bound for the concentration that explains the mystery.

PACS numbers: 74.40.Gh, 74.62.En, 74.81.-g

Na¨ıvely, the superconducting gap ∆ should ensure an
exponentially small quasiparticle concentration at low
temperatures. However, various experiments indicate
that a long-lived, non-equilibrium quasiparticle popula-
tion persists in the superconductor [1–7]. The quasi-
particle poisoning, whereby an unwanted quasiparticle is
trapped in a bound state, is an important factor harming
the ideal operation of superconducting devices [8]. Un-
wanted quasiparticles also forbid tempting perspectives
to use Majorana states in superconductors for topolog-
ically protected quantum computing [9–11]. The poi-
soning rates have been quantiﬁed [12–16] and much ex-
perimental work is directed on protection from poison-
ing, with important advances in this direction [17–20].
The non-equilibrium quasiparticles are produced by some
non-equilibrium agent, which is most likely related to
the absorption of electromagnetic irradiation from the
high-temperature environment [21] and/or electromag-
netic ﬁelds applied to the setup in the course of its mea-
surement and operation. Surprisingly, the eﬀorts to re-
duce the intensity of this non-equilibrium agent are not
entirely satisfying:
the experiments give a substantial
residual quasiparticle concentration, even if all eﬀorts are
performed [22, 23].

In this Letter, we study the dynamics of the annihila-
tion of quasiparticles localized at the spatial ﬂuctuations
of the gap edge. Importantly, we ﬁnd that the average
distance between the quasiparticles depends only loga-
rithmically on the intensity of the non-equilibrium agent.
In simple terms, the exponential dependence of the anni-
hilation rate on the distance between the two quasipar-
ticles results in the quasiparticle concentration

valid at small A (cid:28) ¯Γ/r6
c . [A more accurate estimate for
r is given by Eq. (9).] Here, rc is the relevant radius of
the localized quasiparticle state to be estimated in de-
tail below: for practical circumstances, it exceeds the su-

perconducting coherence length ξ0 by not more than an
order of magnitude. Furthermore, A is the rate of non-
equilibrium generation of quasiparticles per unit volume,
and ¯Γ is a material constant characterizing the inelastic
quasiparticle relaxation due to electron-phonon interac-
tion. The packing coeﬃcient, Cp ≈ 0.605 ± 0.008, can
be derived from a simple bursting bubbles model outlined
below. Equation (1) explains both the substantial con-
centration that is observed, as well as the ineﬃciency of
the eﬀorts to reduce it.

Let us outline the derivation of the above relations.
The relevant quasiparticles have energies close to the gap
edge, and they annihilate by emitting a phonon with en-
ergy ∼ 2∆. Assuming the “dirty” limit, (cid:96) (cid:28) vF /∆,
where vF is the Fermi velocity, and the phonon wave-
length not exceeding the mean free path (cid:96), we derive a
remarkably simple relation for the annihilation rate of
two quasiparticles [24],

(cid:90)

Γ12 = ¯Γ

dr p1(r)p2(r).

(2)

Here p1,2(r) are the normalized probability densities to
ﬁnd the quasiparticles 1,2 at position r. Furthermore we
ﬁnd [24] ¯Γ = 24 γ(∆)/(ν0∆), where ν0 is the normal-
metal density of states and γ(∆) is the normal-metal
electron-phonon relaxation rate at energy ∆. For alu-
minium, this yields ¯Γ (cid:39) 40 s−1µm3. Equation (2) is valid
for localized as well as for delocalized states.

For large enough quasiparticle concentrations (in par-
ticular for delocalized states), one can neglect the correla-
tions in their positions. In that case, a simple mean-ﬁeld
calculation [26] shows that the balance between genera-
tion of non-equilibrium quasiparticles and their annihi-
lation, A = ¯Γc2, results in the non-equilibrium concen-
tration c = (A/¯Γ)1/2. In this regime, a generation rate
A ≈ 4 × 103 s−1µm−3 would thus result in c ≈ 10 µm−3.
However, the annihilation itself reduces the probability
for quasiparticles to be close to each other. Therefore
it boosts the non-equilibrium concentration. This eﬀect

is most pronounced if the quasiparticles are in localized
states and do not move.

The description of the quasiparticle bound states is
provided in Ref. [27] and has been recently revisited [28]
in the context of strongly disordered superconductors.
The main results can be summarized as follows. The
short-range ﬂuctuations of the pairing potential shift the
gap edge, Eg = ∆ − εg, by εg (cid:28) ∆ and smooth the
density of delocalized states on the same scale εg. The
long-range ﬂuctuations of the pairing potential gener-
ate a tail of localized states at energies E < Eg. As
the typical extent of these states is much larger than
the correlation length of the pairing potential ﬂuctu-
ations, the latter can be regarded as point-correlated,
(cid:104)(cid:104)∆(r)∆(r(cid:48))(cid:105)(cid:105) = (δ∆)2δ(r−r(cid:48)). The intensity of the ﬂuc-
tuations is conveniently characterized by a dimensionless

parameter F = a1 (δ∆)2/(∆2ξ3

ξ0 = (cid:112)D/∆ is the diﬀusive coherence length and D is

the diﬀusion constant in the normal metal. For a typical
localized state with energy E < Eg, the energy distance
from the edge, ε = Eg − E, is of the order of the typi-
cal ﬂuctuation, δ∆/L3/2(ε), on the length scale L(ε) of
this state. The length scale itself depends on energy,
L(ε) = ξ0[2∆/(3ε)]1/4. From this, one derives the energy
scale of the exponential tail, εT = F 4/5∆, and the cor-
responding length scale, LT = L(εT ) ≈ 0.90 ξ0/F 1/5. At
εT (cid:28) ε (cid:28) εg, the density of states reaches an exponential

Let us consider a quasiparticle generated by a non-
equilibrium agent. Typically, its energy is much larger
than ∆. However, it loses its energy quickly due to low-
energy electron-phonon interactions before annihilating
with another quasiparticle. At some stage, the quasi-
particle reaches the gap edge and becomes localized at
ε (cid:39) εT . It is important for us to understand that its re-
laxation does not stop here. One can estimate the num-
ber of localized states that overlap with a given state and
have a lower energy,
N (ε) ≡ L3(ε)

at ε (cid:39) εT , where N (εT ) ∼ NT ∼ g 4(cid:112)ε3

Here g = πν0∆ξ3

ther from these states, and the relaxation stops only at

FIG. 1: The density of states and single quasiparticle re-
laxation in a superconductor.
(a) The density of states is
BCS-like except near the gap edge. (b) Near the gap edge,
the singularity is rounded at an energy scale εg and a tail of
localized states within the gap develops at an energy scale εT .
(c) The relaxation of a single quasiparticle stops at an energy
scale εc > εT , where the localized states with lower energy no
longer overlap.

εc ≈ εT (ln NT )4/5. Therefore we come to a rather
unexpected conclusion: the quasiparticles end up their
random relaxation process at a rather deﬁnite radius,
rc ≡ L(εc)/2, that is,

rc (cid:39) 0.45 ξ0(εT /∆)−1/4(ln NT )−1/5

(6)

as illustrated in Fig. 1. Taking standard parameters for
Al [32], we expect that scale to be only slightly larger
than half the coherence length, ξ0 ≈ 100 nm. For in-
stance, taking εT /∆ = 10−2 and εT /∆ = 10−4, we ﬁnd
rc ≈ ξ0 and 3ξ0, respectively.

Using these results, we can formulate a model of
stochastic quasiparticle dynamics
[33]. The quasipar-
ticles appear in random points with the rate A, keep
their positions, and annihilate pairwise with a rate Γ(R)
that is a function of their mutual distance R. The rate
is obtained from Eqs. (2) and (4). Namely,

The behavior of the model is governed by a single di-
c /¯Γ. At large values of this
mensionless parameter, Ar6
parameter, the typical distance between quasiparticles,
r, is much smaller than rc, and correlations are negligi-
ble as Γ(r) ∼ ¯Γr−3
is constant on that length scale. In
this limit, we recover the mean-ﬁeld result given above,
c = (A/¯Γ)1/2, which is independent of rc and does not
rely on tail states. At small values of the parameter

In this limit, it can
be estimated from the competition of the annihilation

Due to the exponential dependence of the annihilation
rate on the typical distance, one of the rates prevails

If the non-equilibrium agent ceases to work, A = 0,
the quasiparticles concentration relaxes very slowly. In
particular, Eq. (8) yields the estimate ˜r(t) ∝ ln(¯Γt/r3
c ).
Beyond the logarithmic approximation, the results of the
simulation [24] are consistent with those obtained from
the stationary solution.

Using realistic values for the generation rate, we thus
can give accurate estimates of the quasiparticle concen-
tration.
In particular, cosmic radiation is dominated
by protons with energy in the GeV range and a ﬂux of
∼ 1 s−1cm−2 [34]. The stopping power of GeV protons
in aluminum is ∼ 1 MeV cm−1 [35]. Assuming a per-
fect conversion into quasiparticles of the deposited en-
ergy, we thus ﬁnd a generation rate A ∼ 10−5 s−1µm−3
(∼ 1 day
−1µm−3!). At rc ∼ 0.1 µm, it yields a quasi-
particle concentration c ∼ 0.01 µm−3, which is close to
the one measured in two recent experiments [7, 22], where
best eﬀorts where performed in screening electromagnetic
radiation.

In the above considerations, we have assumed that the
annihilation rate does not depend on the spin state of
two quasiparticles. This is valid in two cases:
i) the
localization radius rc exceeds the spin-orbit relaxation
length, which may be relevant for heavy-atom metals;
ii) the spin coherence time of an isolated quasiparticle is
shorter than the (exponentially long) timescale Γﬁt for
annihilation. In the opposite regimes, the quasiparticles
could only annihilate if in a spin-singlet state.

To account for the spin structure is a challenging task
owing to complex quantum entanglement of the spins of
the overlapping quasiparticles that survive the annihi-
lation. As a simplifying description, we considered an
extension of the bursting bubbles model in which each
bubble is assigned a classical spin degree of freedom.
Whenever two bubbles with opposite spins overlap, they
burst. The result of our simulation [24] is an enhanced
Cp ≈ 2.19 ± 0.05. When spin-ﬂip processes are added,
the concentration decreases down to Cp ≈ 0.61 upon in-
creasing the spin-ﬂip rate, in agreement with the above
considerations for the spinless case.

The validity of our estimation is limited by a variety of
complex factors that can inﬂuence the non-equilibrium
quasiparticle dynamics in superconductors. In particu-
lar, we assumed immobile quasiparticles, which is valid
in the limit of a vanishing temperature. At ﬁnite temper-
ature, the quasiparticles could diﬀuse owing to inelastic
transitions, even if they reside in localized states. This
would favor their annihilation as they would come closer
to each other. As a result, the estimate for the concen-
tration given in this Letter is rather an upper bound at
a given generation rate. The evaluation of the diﬀusion
of localized quasiparticles, as well as its complex tem-
perature dependence, would be a subject of interesting
research that is needed to understand the details of their
dynamics.

FIG. 2:
Illustration of the bursting bubbles model. Each par-
ticle is represented by a bubble with diameter r (dark gray).
If a new particle appears centered in the gray area with di-
ameter 2r (case a, central panel), it immediately annihilates
with another particle (left panel). If the particle appears in
the white area (case b), it is simply added to the system (right
panel).

over the other completely if the distance is changed by
δr ∼ rc (cid:28) r. This allows one to introduce a simpli-
ﬁed model of bursting bubbles, see Fig. 2. Regardless
the details of Γ(R), we can consider the quasiparticles as
spherical bubbles of radius r/2. If two bubbles overlap,
the particles annihilate. This model is easily simulated:
we add bubbles to the system at random points. If the
added bubble does not overlap with the existing ones, the
number of quasiparticles is increased by 1. If there is an
overlap, two bubbles burst, decreasing the number by 1.
Equilibrium is achieved when these two outcomes hap-
pen with equal probabilities. This is the case when the
volume covered by spheres of radius r centered around
the quasiparticles equals half of the whole volume. If we
rather na¨ıvely assume that the spheres do not overlap,
the volume covered is 4πr3/3 per quasiparticle, and the
concentration is c = Cp(4πr3/3)−1 with Cp = 0.5.
In
reality, some spheres overlap, so the simulation yields a
slightly bigger packing coeﬃcient, see Eq. (1).

To improve upon the logarithmic estimation of r, we
performed simulations of the full model taking into ac-
count the details of Γ(R) [24]. The stationary concentra-
tions are shown in Fig. 3.
In the limit ˜r ≡ r/rc (cid:29) 1, the dynamics of the quasi-
particle concentration is given by an evolution equation
˙c(t) = A − Γﬁtc(t), with the eﬀective asymptotic relax-
ation rate Γﬁt(r) = 4π/(3Cp)b¯Γr−3

To estimate the material constant ¯Γ = 24γ(∆)/(ν0∆)
in aluminum, we ﬁrst notice that the rate γ(∆) can
be related with the characteristic electron-phonon relax-
ation time τ0 that is introduced in Ref. [S3], γ(∆) =
(3τ0)−1(∆/kBTc)3, where Tc is the superconducting crit-
ical temperature and kB is the Boltzmann constant. In
aluminum, τ0 ≈ 400 ns [S3] and the superconducting gap
at zero temperature satisﬁes ∆/kBTc ≈ 1.76. Then, us-
ing ν0 ≈ 2 × 1010 eV−1µm−3 and ∆ ≈ 200 µeV, we ﬁnd
¯Γ ≈ 40 s−1µm3.

SIMULATION OF THE DYNAMICS OF

SPINLESS QUASIPARTICLES WITH

ANNIHILATION RATE Γ(R)

Γtot =(cid:80)

To determine the equilibrium concentration as a func-
tion of the quasiparticle injection rate, we performed
a numerical simulation of our model with pairwise an-
nihilating particles. The simulation volume was a box
with periodic boundary conditions and size L × L × L.
In each simulation step, either a quasiparticle was gen-
erated at a random position with probability pgen =
AL3/(Γtot +AL3), or two quasiparticles were annihilated
with probability pan = 1−pgen = Γtot/(Γtot +AL3). Here
i<j Γ(Ri − Rj), where Ri are the quasiparticle
positions, and Γ( (cid:126)R) is given by Eq. (8) in the main text.
For the annihilation process, a speciﬁc pair (i, j) is cho-
sen with probability pij = Γ(Ri − Rj)/Γtot. To acquire
the equilibrium concentration in a broad range of injec-

the box was varied in the range L = 26rc − 200rc, such
that the steady-state number of particles in the box was
N = 30 − 8000.

Starting with an empty box, typically 20000 simula-
tion steps were enough to reach equilibrium, where the
concentration c = N/L3 stayed approximately constant.
After equilibrium was reached, we determined the aver-
age concentration by averaging the particle number N

mean-ﬁeld ﬁt is given by c = (A/¯Γ)1/2.

over the next 100000 simulation steps. The resulting c
vs A graph is shown in Fig. S1. While at large injection
rates the mean-ﬁeld approximation provides a good ﬁt,
the concentration at small injection rates largely exceeds
the mean-ﬁeld estimation. The low-concentration part

In a similar way, we modeled the relaxation of quasi-
particles in the absence of quasiparticle injection, A = 0.
To do so, we ﬁrst let the the system reach equilibrium
c /¯Γ =
using a fairly large injection rate (we used Ar6
6 × 10−6, such that the equilibrium number of quasi-
particles is N ≈ 1400 for a box of size L = 80rc). Then
we monitored the evolution of the concentration after
switching oﬀ the quasiparticle injection and considering
only annihilation processes. Namely, at each step two
quasiparticles are annihilated, and the relaxation rate
dc/dt, which is given by

is recorded. The recording of data was started once the
number had decreased to N = 1000. The whole relax-
ation process was repeated 1000 times to obtain averaged
values for dc/dt. The resulting numerical data points to-
gether with the ﬁt by Eq. (9) in the main text are shown
in Fig. S2. It can be seen that the ﬁt qualitatively de-
scribes the numerical data, but it is nevertheless signiﬁ-
cantly worse than for the equilibrium concentration, Fig.
S1. This may be explained by two factors. First, Eq. (9)
in the main text does not account for the spatial distri-
bution of quasiparticles. This is expected to play a more

important role when the system is far away from equilib-
rium. Second, the relaxation simulation was done with a
smaller number of quasiparticles in the box on average.
Thus, the numerical data is of lower quality.

SIMULATION OF THE BURSTING BUBBLES

MODEL WITH SPIN

Within the bursting bubbles model with spin, each
quasiparticle is represented by a bubble with radius r/2
carrying a classical spin that is either up or down. Only
two overlapping bubbles with opposite spins burst.
In our simulation, the system volume is a box with
periodic boundary conditions and size L × L × L. We
chose L = 30r, as it gave the best performance in terms
of accuracy and simulation time. As a check, several runs
with L = 45r were done, yielding the same quasiparticle
concentration in equilibrium.

In each simulation step, either a quasiparticle with
random spin is generated with probability pgen =
AL3/(AL3 + N τ−1
sf ), or the spin of a random quasi-
particle is ﬂipped with probability psf = 1 − pgen =
sf /(AL3 + N τ−1
N τ−1
sf ), where τ−1
is the spin-ﬂip rate.
After this step, if the bubble of the added or ﬂipped par-
ticle intersects with a bubble with opposite spin, the two
bubbles “burst”, and the corresponding particles are re-
moved from the system.

sf

In equilibrium, the dimensionless concentration (pack-
ing coeﬃcient) Cp = 4πcr3/3 is a function of the dimen-
sionless spin-ﬂip time ζ = 4πAr3τsf /3 only. We varied
this parameter in the range ζ = 0 − 4200. The case
ζ = 0 corresponds to an eﬀectively spinless system, such

encircling the quasiparticle, there might be (i) no quasi-
particles, (ii) only quasiparticles of the same spin, (iii)
only quasiparticles of the opposite spin, or (iv) quasipar-
ticles of both spins present. In cases (i) and (ii) the total
number of quasiparticles increases by 1, whereas in cases
(iii) and (iv) it decreases by 1. Since for incoming quasi-
particles both directions of spin are equally probable, the
probabilities of (ii) and (iii) are always the same. Thus,
the stationary concentration is achieved if the probabili-
ties for (i) and (iv) are equal as well, p(i) = p(iv). To esti-
mate these probabilities, we make the rough assumption
that the positions of all quasiparticles do not correlate.
This assumptions allows us to determine the probability
to ﬁnd no spin-up/spin-down quasiparticle in a sphere
with radius r: p± = exp[−4πr3c±/3]. Then, p(i) = p+p−
and p(iv) = (1 − p+)(1 − p−). Hence, in equilibrium
p+ + p− = 1, or

vertical bars. The hashed region indicates the concentration

that the value Cp(ζ = 0) = 0.605 is recovered. In ad-
dition, a simulation without spin ﬂips was performed,
which corresponds to ζ = ∞. In that case, we obtained
Cp(∞) = 2.19 ± 0.05. The dependence of Cp on ζ is
shown in Fig. S3. It can be seen that the packing coeﬃ-
cient reaches the value Cp(∞) rather slowly with growing
ζ. In particular, we found that Cp(ζ) at ζ (cid:29) 1 is well
approximated by

Cp(ζ) = Cp(∞) − 4.2√
ζ

.

(S8)

The time evolution of the concentration in the absence
of spin ﬂips, ζ = ∞, was also recorded. Typical graphs
of the particle number vs simulation step dependence are
shown in Fig. S4. It can be seen that the system exhibits
large ﬂuctuations on a time scale of the order of 107 simu-
lation steps. Note that this requires averaging over many
simulation steps when determining Cp(∞). Speciﬁcally,
the average of the concentration was taken over 5 × 107
steps.

Another interesting feature that we observed is the
strong correlation between the concentration and the in-
stantaneous polarization of the system, P = (c+ − c−)/c,
where c+ and c− are the concentrations of spin-up and
spin-down quasiparticles, respectively. Certainly, P = 0
on average, however, the polarization exhibits strong ﬂuc-
tuations that are accompanied by ﬂuctuations of the con-
centration. Using the system evolution data, we obtained
the c vs P graph shown in Fig. S5. To qualitatively ex-
plain the c vsvs P dependence, we use the following argu-
mentation. When a new quasiparticle is added to the sys-
tem, there are four possibilities: in a sphere with radius r

simulation. In reality, the quasiparticle positions corre-
late, which allows one to achieve higher concentrations.
A better ﬁt of the c vs P numerical data is obtained, if
the concentration is increased by a factor of 1.55:
