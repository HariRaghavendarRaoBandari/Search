ABSTRACT

Context. Previous studies of the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation have mainly targeted Infrared-Dark
Clouds (or IRDCs) toward the inner Galaxy. This is due to the fact that IRDCs were ﬁrst detected in absorption against the bright
mid-IR background of the inner Galaxy, requiring a favourable location to be observed. By selection, IRDCs therefore represent only
a fraction of the Galactic clouds capable of forming massive stars and star clusters. Due to their low dust temperatures, IRDCs are
however bright in the far-IR and millimeter and thus, observations at these wavelengths have the potential to provide a complete
sample of star-forming massive clouds across the Galaxy.
Aims. Our aim is to identify the clouds at the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation across the Galaxy and
compare their physical properties as a function of Galactic longitude and galactocentric distance.
Methods. We have examined the physical properties of a homogeneous galactic cold core sample obtained with the Planck satellite
across the Galactic Plane. With the use of Herschel Hi-GAL observations, we have characterized the internal structure of the most
reliable Galactic cold clumps within the Early Cold Core (ECC) Planck catalog. By using background-subtracted Herschel images, we
have derived the H2 column density and dust temperature maps for 48 Planck clumps covered by the Herschel Hi-GAL survey. Their
basic physical parameters (size, mass, and average dust temperature) have been calculated and analyzed as a function of location
within the Galaxy. These properties have also been compared with the empirical relation for massive star formation derived by
Kauﬀmann & Pillai (2010), and with the clump evolutionary tracks calculated by Molinari et al. (2008).
Results. Most of the Planck clumps contain signs of star formation. About 25% of the clumps are massive enough to form high mass
stars / star clusters since they exceed the empirical threshold for massive star formation of Kauﬀmann & Pillai (2010). Planck clumps
toward the Galactic center region show higher peak column densities and higher average dust temperatures than those of the clumps
in the outer Galaxy. Although we only have seven clumps without associated YSOs, the Hi-GAL data show no apparent diﬀerences
in the properties of Planck cold clumps with and without star formation. Most of the clumps are found close to the pre-main sequence
evolutionary stage, with some undergoing an eﬃcient clearing of their envelopes.

1. Introduction
In contrast to low-mass stars, the process by which massive stars
form remains poorly understood. The characterization of the ini-
tial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation is in-
deed challenging: massive stars are less common and have much
shorter lifetimes than low mass stars. The formation of massive
stars and star clusters is believed to start in cold and dense molec-
ular structures. When viewed against the bright Galactic mid-
IR background, these clouds are called Infrared Dark Clouds
(IRDCs). While some show evidence for ongoing star forma-
tion, others appear to be starless. Thus, IRDCs represent the best
objects where to study the initial conditions for massive star and
star cluster formation. This has been veriﬁed by single-dish ob-
servations in low-resolution (e.g. Pillai et al. 2006; Chambers
et al. 2009) and interferometric observations in high-resolution
(e.g. Wang et al. 2011, 2012, 2014; Longmore et al. 2013; Tan
et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015).

(cid:63) Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments pro-
vided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with impor-
tant participation from NASA.

Some of the early studies of IRDCs focused on the charac-
terization of the global physical properties of IRDCs by using
Spitzer 8 µm data, i.e. based on extinction maps (Rathborne et al.
2006, 2008; Peretto et al. 2010; Butler & Tan 2009). However,
such studies have a statistical bias because IRDCs, by selection,
only represent the population of dense clouds projected onto the
bright background of the inner Galaxy, as they need a favorable
location to absorb background infrared radiation. Not all the dark
patches are real star-forming objects. IRDC catalogues based
only on mid-infrared data indeed overestimate the number of
real sources by a factor of ∼2 (Jackson et al. 2008). In addition,
Wilcock et al. (2012) studied 3171 IRDC candidates within the
l = 300-330◦ region of the Hi-GAL survey. Only 38 % of them
were bright at the Herschel wavelengths, and therefore associ-
ated with cold cloud structures. The other mid-infrared IRDC
candidates are simply minima in the mid-infrared background.

An unbiased selection criterion to identify the whole Galac-
tic population of massive pre-star/pre-cluster forming clouds is
based on the emission properties of dust in the far-IR and sub-

Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS, Aguirre et al. 2011) have pro-
vided catalogues of submillimeter sources throughout the inner
Galaxy. The outer Galaxy is however out of the coverage for
these systematic surveys.

For the ﬁrst time, the Planck satellite has provided an in-
ventory of the cold condensations throughout the Galaxy. The
Planck survey covered the submm-to-mm wavelength range with
unprecedented sensitivity, furnishing the ﬁrst all sky catalogue
of cold objects. This is thus a perfect database where to identify
the coldest structures in the whole Galaxy, oﬀering the opportu-
nity to search for massive star forming clumps also in the outer
Galaxy and investigate the dependence of massive star forma-
tion with location in the Galactic disk. While in extragalactic
studies only the average star formation properties can be stud-
ied (Kennicutt & Evans 2012), a more detailed analysis can be
performed in the Galaxy toward diﬀerent environments (e.g. the
Galactic Centre, the spiral arms, and the outer Galaxy). The an-
gular resolution of the Planck observations is however scarce for
a thorough study of these objects, and higher angular resolution
observations are needed to obtain detailed information about the
temperature, column density structure, and star-formation con-
tent of these cold objects.

In this paper we present the analysis of the Herschel observa-
tions of 48 Planck sources that fall within the Hi-GAL (Molinari
et al. 2010; Molinari 2011, 2012) survey area. We use the Planck
ECC catalogue, which provides continuum ﬂuxes for over 900
Planck sources across a broad range of wavelengths (from 350
to 850 µm), to systematically analyze the distribution of cold
clumps in the Galactic Plane. The higher spatial resolution of
Herschel PACS and SPIRE (Poglitsch et al. 2010; Griﬃn et al.
2010) makes it possible to examine the internal structure of these
Planck sources and allows us to identify their high column den-
sity peaks and sample their deeply embedded sources with angu-
lar resolutions of ∼5(cid:48)(cid:48)-36(cid:48)(cid:48). In Section 2 we present the sample
and datasets used in this paper, including the distance estimate
for our sample. In Section 3 we describe the analysis methods
and results based on the Hi-GAL and Planck data. Finally, in
Section 4 we discuss our results.

2. Data and sample selection
2.1. Planck catalogues of Galactic Cold Core Objects
The Planck satellite (Tauber et al. 2010) has provided an all-
sky submillimetre / millimetre survey covering the wavelengths
around and longwards of the intensity maximum of cold dust
emission. While ν2Bν(T=10K) peaks close to 300 µm, the cold-
est dust with a temperature of T∼6 K shows its maximum emis-
sion close to 500 µm. Combined with far-infrared data such
as the IRAS survey, the data enable accurate determination of
both the dust temperature and the spectral index. The Early Cold
Cores 1 Catalogue (ECC, Planck Collaboration et al. 2011) is
part of the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue
(ERCSC) and the ECC forms a subset of the full Cold Core Cat-
alogue of Planck Objects (C3PO; more than 10000 objects have
been detected; Planck Collaboration et al. 2011). The ECC, with
a total of 915 objects over the sky, contains only the most secure
detections (SNR > 15) with colour temperatures below 14 K.

The Planck Catalogue of Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCC,
Planck Collaboration 2015) is the last release of Planck clump

by the Planck, thus Planck “cores” have a wide range of physical sizes
depending on distances. They are diﬀerent than the 0.1 pc “cores” usu-
ally adopted by the star formation community.

data tables. It contains 13188 Galactic sources with a tempera-
ture ranging from 5.8 K to 20 K. 42 % of these sources have
available distance estimates. A few ECC sources are not part of
the PGCC catalogue because they do not satisfy the compactness
criterion of the PGCC catalogue, i.e. they are slightly more ex-
tended compared to the other sources. We note however that the
old ECC and the new PGCC data are in good agreement for the
selected 48 clumps. Indeed, the derived dust temperatures, spec-
tral indices and clump sizes diﬀer by less than 6%, 1.5% and 2%,
respectively.

2.2. Planck ECC sources in the Hi-GAL survey
To build up our sample, we have selected the ECC sources that
were also covered by the Hi-GAL survey. Hi-GAL was one of
the Herschel Open Time Key-Projects (Molinari et al. 2010) and
with its extensions (in OT1 and Hi-GAL2pi; Molinari 2012,
2011) it mapped the entire Galactic Plane of the Milky Way (-
1◦ < b < +1◦, following the Galactic warp) in 5 bands with the
PACS instrument at 70 and 160 µm, and with the SPIRE instru-
ment at 250, 350 and 500 µm with spatial resolutions of 5(cid:48)(cid:48), 13(cid:48)(cid:48),
18(cid:48)(cid:48), 25(cid:48)(cid:48) and 36(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively.

We have selected the 48 ECC sources that were also covered
by the Hi-GAL survey (see Table 1). These are all the ECC ob-
jects that fall within the Herschel Hi-GAL survey area and all
the 5 Herschel band images are available for each source. Three
sources from our sample are not part of the latest PGCC cata-
logue due to their lower level of compactness (G001.64-00.07,
G201.13+00.31 and G296.52-01.19), but we included them in
our analysis. Based on their physical properties, there are no sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences between these 3 rejected ECC clumps and
the rest of the ECCs within the Hi-GAL region (see later in Sec-
tion 3.3).

The main parameters associated with the Planck clumps are
shown in Table 1. The mass calculation based on Planck data is
described in Section 3.1.

2.3. Distance determination of ECC objects
Distance determination is needed for the mass and size calcu-
lation of the ECC clumps. For this purpose, association with
known IRDCs and molecular line follow up survey data were
used. Table 1 in the Appendix shows all the available estimated
distances for the ECC objects and the ﬁnal adopted distances.
The data are coming from diﬀerent sources:

1. Kinematic distance based on the Purple Mountain Observa-
tory’s CO J = 1-0 survey data by Wu et al. (2012). CO J = 1-0
emission is detected in all ECC clumps except one. Among
these sources, 28 clumps belong to our Hi-GAL ECC sam-
ple and have velocity and distance estimates in the Wu et al.
(2012) survey. Half of them (15 sources) show more than
one velocity components. In those cases, we used the veloc-
ity component with the brightest line intensity to estimate the
distance of the ECC clump.

2. Kinematic distance based on the MALT90 (Millimetre As-
tronomy Legacy Team 90 GHz, ATNF Mopra 22-m tele-
scope, Jackson et al. 2013) survey data. Six ECC clumps
were covered by this survey. For the clumps with more than
one molecular line detected (i.e. N2H+, 13CO and 12CO), we
have adopted the kinematic distance derived from the species
with the higher critical density.

3. Kinematic distance based on our own APEX observations
(Zahorecz et al. in prep). APEX observations were per-

S. Zahorecz et al.: Physical Properties of Galactic Planck Cold Cores

formed towards 3 ECC clumps as part of the E-093.C-
0866A-2014 project. Again, the kinematic distance adopted
for these clumps was the one associated with the emission
from the species with the higher critical density.

4. Kinematic distance based on the CfA CO survey (Dame et al.
2001) data. 24 objects out of our sample of 48 Planck clumps
show a single / dominating velocity component in the CfA
12CO survey data. In Figure 1, we show some examples of
the CfA CO survey spectra measured for the ECC sources
that do not have any distance estimate from the Purple Moun-
tain Observatory survey.

5. Associations with known IRDCs. 6 ECC clumps are asso-
ciated with known IRDC objects. Their kinematic distances
were obtained by Parsons et al. (2009) based on the Galactic
Ring Survey data.

6. Distance from the Planck PGCC catalogue. This distance de-
termination available in the PGCC catalogue was obtained
by using several methods: kinematic distance estimates, op-
tical extinction based on SDSS DR7, NIR extinction towards
IRDCs, and NIR extinction. In case of the NIR extinction
methods, negative values indicated upper limits.

The distance ﬂags for the ECC clumps considered in our
sample are indicated in Table 1. Once the molecular line velocity
information was collected for our sample, we estimated the kine-
matic distance of the ECC clumps by using the rotation curve of
the Galaxy from Reid et al. (2014). We employed the publicly
available fortran code from Parsons et al. (2009) to relate the ra-
dial velocity to the source’s Galactrocentric radius. In the inner
Galaxy, this Galactocentric radius corresponds to two distances
along the line of sight, the near and the far kinematic distances.
The near kinematic distance was adopted if only kinematic dis-
tance estimation was available for the source. For the sources in
the outer Galaxy, the distance solution is unique.

We note that in twelve cases we have both kinematic- and
extinction-based distance estimates available. The average dif-
ference between these two methods is 10%, although for two
objects they diﬀer by more than 50%. When an extinction-based
distance estimate was available, we used the latter one as the
adopted distance (see Table 1) since this method reproduces
maser parallax distances (with very low level of uncertainties)
better than kinematics distances (see Foster et al. 2012). Other-
wise, we adopted the kinematic distance estimates obtained for
the remaining ECC clumps.

Calculations of mass, size and H2 column density were per-
formed only for the 40 clumps with available distance estima-
tions. The distances are between 0.1 kpc and 8.1 kpc, the angu-
lar sizes lie between 4(cid:48) - 15(cid:48), which give us spatial scales in the
range of 0.5 pc - 29 pc.

We note that the distance estimates for the majority (92%) of
our ECC clumps are likely correct within a factor of 2, and so
our mass estimates also lie within a factor of 4. Only 3 sources
(i.e. 8% of the sample) may have distance discrepancies as large
as a factor of 5, implying a factor of 25 uncertainty in the cal-
culated mass. Therefore, our results on the mass distribution of
ECC clumps as a function of Galactic longitude and Galactocen-
tric distance are not expected to change substantially due to the
errors in the distance determination.

2.4. Location within the Galaxy
Once the distance of the selected ECC clumps has been esti-
mated, we can determine the location where these objects fall
within the Galaxy. Figure 2 shows the galactic distribution of

et al. (2012) survey. Green line shows the ﬁtted Gaussian component

the selected clumps. 1/3 and 2/3 of them are located in the inner
and outer part of the Galaxy, respectively, between Galactic lon-
gitudes of 278◦ to 89◦ and 144◦ to 262◦. Based on our estimated
distances, sixty percent of them fall on top of the Galactic spiral
arms as deﬁned in Reid et al. (2014).

3. Methods and Results
3.1. Mass determination based on Planck data
From the ﬂuxes measured by Planck for every cold clump and
provided in the ECC catalogue, we can estimate their individual
masses by using

M =

S νD2
κνBν(T)

(1)

where S ν is the integrated ﬂux density, D is the distance, κν is the
dust opacity, and Bν(T) is the Planck function for dust tempera-
ture at T. The dust opacity was adopted by Planck Collaboration
et al. (2011) as:

κν = 0.1 ×(cid:18)

(cid:19)β

ν

1T Hz

cm2/g

(2)

For this calculation, we used the integrated ﬂux density at
the frequency ν=857GHz from the ECC catalogue, the derived
core temperature, Tcore, and the emissivity spectral index, βcore.
We note that the Planck ﬂuxes at ν= 857GHz were used for the
computation because this frequency is the closest one to the fre-
quency reference (i.e. 1THz) for the formula of the dust opacity
(see Eq.2), so that the impact on the spectral index β remains
small compared to the uncertainty in κν. In addition the 857GHz
band has also the best SNR of all Planck observations and the
dust emission at this frequency is optically thin (see details in
Planck Collaboration et al. 2011).
The average calculated mass based on the Planck data is
1.2×106 M(cid:12), with a minimum and maximum value of 10 M(cid:12)

tively. This average value is biased by a few very massive sources
within the sample. The 25th, 50th and 75th percentile of the data
are 1.6×102 M(cid:12), 1.7×103 M(cid:12) and 2.2×104 M(cid:12), respectively.

3.2. Clump categories based on Hi-Gal 70µm data

In this Section, we evaluate the level of star and star cluster for-
mation within the Planck cold clumps observed by Herschel us-
ing the 70µm Hi-GAL images. We note that the 70 µm images
have the best angular resolution within the Hi-GAL data and
therefore provide information about the point-like sources found
within the clumps and likely associated with protostellar objects.
Also it is an excellent probe of the population of intermediate-
and high-mass young stellar objects in star forming regions (see
eg. Ragan et al. 2012; Veneziani et al. 2013). Planck clumps
without 70 µm sources are the best candidates to study the earli-
est phases of star formation, since the absence of 70 µm emission
likely indicates that protostellar activity has aﬀected very little its
surrounding environment.

In order to investigate whether there are signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences in the physical properties (i.e. dust temperature, mass,
maximum H2 column density) between clumps with and without
star formation, we divided the sample of Planck cold clumps into
two diﬀerent categories: clumps with no sign of star formation
(Category I, 11 sources) and clumps with active star formation
(Category II, 37 sources).

We probe the star formation activity by checking the pres-
ence/absence of 70 µm point sources within the deﬁned clump
boundaries (see Section 3.3). From our classiﬁcation of clumps
with/without 70µm point-sources, we ﬁnd that 11 clumps (23%
of the sample of 48 clumps) do not show any star formation ac-
tivity. The criterion may be distant-dependent due to the sensi-
tivity of the 70 µm observations. To check for this possible bias,
we plotted the distribution of ECC clumps with and without 70
µm sources as a function of distance (see Figure 3). We ﬁnd that
sources without 70 µm sources are not, in average, further away
than sources with 70 µm emission. On the contrary, most of the
cores with no 70 µm sources lie within ∼4.5 kpc from the Sun,
with only one exception, G354.81+00.35 at ∼6kpc.

Figure 4 shows examples of Category I (G146.71+2.05) and
Category II (G319.35+0.87) clumps. Herschel 70, 250 and 500
µm images are shown with angular resolution of 5(cid:48)(cid:48), 18(cid:48)(cid:48) and
36(cid:48)(cid:48), respectively. Similar set of ﬁgures are available for all the
48 sources in the Appendix.

To investigate the possibility of chance alignments, we esti-
mated the expected number of point sources within the clump
regions. For this, we identiﬁed the sources present within 2×2
square degree Hi-GAL 70 µm tiles using SExtractor (Bertin &
Arnouts 1996). Except for the ECC clumps located in the inner
20 degree of the Galaxy, the expected number of point sources
due to chance alignment is less than 2 (median values of 0.02
for |l-180◦| < 90◦ and of 1.8 for 90◦ < |l-180◦| < 170◦), which
implies that the 70 µm sources detected in the ECC clumps gen-
uinely trace the star formation activity within the clumps. For
the ECC clumps in the Galactic center, we note however that the
number of expected sources by chance alignment is higher than
for the ECC clumps in the Galactic disk (median value of 78 for
|l-180◦| > 170◦). This is related to the H2 column density value
chosen to deﬁne the clump boundary (3×1021 cm−2, see Section
3.3), which covers larger areas. In any case, even for these Galac-
tic Center ECC clumps, the number of 70 µm sources detected
in the Hi-GAL images is, in average, higher than the expected
number of sources due to chance alignment.

From the integrated ﬂux of the faintest detected 70µm point
sources, we can estimate the luminosity (and mass) limit below
which no source is detected in the Hi-GAL images. The faintest
detected sources in the ECC clumps have ﬂuxes F70 ∼45mJy. In
order to make the conversion from 70µm ﬂux to luminosity, we
use the following correlation (see Dunham et al. 2008):
Lint = 3.3 × 108F0.94
(3)
where F70 is in [ergs cm−2 s−1] and it is normalised to 0.14 kpc,
and d is the distance in kpc. The faintest sources in our ECC
clumps (with F70=45mJy) have luminosities 0.2 - 0.7 - 1.5 - 2.6
L(cid:12) at 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 kpc. For distances larger than 3 kpc, only high
mass protostars are luminous enough to be visible.

termediate mass star formation. We ﬁnd that four of our ECC
clumps without 70µm point-sources show AKARI/WISE YSOs.
This implies that, although these clumps have not formed mas-
sive protostars yet, they show a certain level of low-mass star for-
mation. From this, the total number of clumps without any star
formation activity (low-mass and high-mass) within their clump
boundaries is reduced to 7, which represents 15% of the whole
sample. Since we are mostly interested in the potential of the
ECC clumps to form massive protostars, we will hereafter fo-
cus on the clump classiﬁcation based on the presence/absence of
70µm sources only.

3.3. Physical properties derived from Hi-GAL data
The higher-angular resolution of the Herschel Hi-GAL observa-
tions allows us to investigate not only the internal physical struc-
ture (compactness and fragmentation) of the Planck cold clumps,
but also the small-scale variations in the dust temperature and H2
column density distribution of these clumps. These higher angu-
lar resolution data also provide more accurate estimates of the
fraction of the mass locked into the densest parts of the clumps,
i.e. into the regions that will form massive stars and star clusters.
temperature (Tdust) and H2 column density maps
(N(H2)) were derived by ﬁtting the SED constructed based on
the Herschel PACS 160 µm and SPIRE 250-500 µm data pixel-
by-pixel (see the detailed description of the method in Wang
et al. 2015). As a ﬁrst step, we smoothed the maps to the SPIRE
500µm data resolution (i.e. to 36”) and we performed back-
ground subtraction. See the Appendix for a detailed description
of the background subtraction methods we tested. As an exam-
ple, Figure 5 shows the 70 µm images (left) and calculated col-
umn density (middle) and dust temperature (right) maps for ECC
G146.71+02.05 and G319.35+0.87.

To derive the mass, average temperature and size of the
clumps, we deﬁned the clumps’ boundaries on the background-
subtracted H2 column density maps. The peak column density
values span 2 order of magnitudes, so we have used two diﬀerent
column density thresholds for the source deﬁnition: 3×1021 cm−2
and 1022 cm−2. These values correspond to extinctions of ∼3
mag and ∼9 mag, respectively (see Güver & Özel 2009). These
thresholds are shown in Figure 5 in red (for N(H2)=1022 cm−2)
and yellow contours (for N(H2)=3×1021 cm−2). The diﬀerent

column density thresholds give us information about the frac-
tion of mass associated with the diﬀuse structure of the clump
and with the densest parts of the clumps, where star formation is
expected to occur.
We note that for one clump, G249.23-01.64, the derived peak
column density is smaller than 3×1021 cm−2, and therefore its
average dust temperature, mass and size within the 3×1021 cm−2
and 1022 cm−2 contours could not be calculated (see Table 1).
We do not detect 70 µm sources in it. The peak column density
is smaller than 1022 cm−2 for 24 clumps; for 12 of them we have
multiple subclumps. In this case, the total mass of the clump
was calculated as the addition of the subclump masses. For four
sources in the Galactic Centre region, the peak column density is
larger than 1022 cm−2, but their masses, sizes and temperatures
within the used contours were not calculated, because the size
within these column density limits is not comparable with the
ECC’s size. The region within the column density limit of 5-
10×1022 cm−2 is comparable with the ECC objects’ size.

In order to provide a characteristic dust temperature for
the ECC clumps based on the Hi-GAL data, a column density
weighted temperature was calculated within the clump bound-
ary for every object. In this way, the derived temperature is domi-
nated by the temperature of the dense material. The average tem-
perature among all ECC clumps is 13.9 K based on the Herschel
images, while the average dust temperature based on the Planck
data diﬀers by 1.5-3.0 K with respect to the Herschel one. This
diﬀerence will be discussed in more detail in the next section.

In Table 1, we report all the calculated average temperatures,
sizes and masses values based on the two column density limits
of 1022 cm−2 and 3×1021 cm−2.

3.4. Distribution of the ECC physical properties with Galactic

longitude and Galactocentric distance

After calculating the average H2 column densities, dust temper-
atures and masses of the ECC clumps from the Herschel data,
we can investigate whether variations in these properties are ob-
served depending on the location of the ECC clumps within the
Galaxy.

In Figure 6, we show the maximum H2 column density distri-
bution of the ECC clumps as a function of Galactic longitude and
galactocentric distance. ECC clumps toward the Galactic center
region show the highest peak column density values. The peak
column density decreases with galactocentric distance. There is
a 3 order of magnitude diﬀerence between the peak N(H2) val-
ues in the Galactic center region and in the outer part of the
Galaxy. From Figure 6, we also ﬁnd that H2 peak column den-
sities N(H2)>9×1023 cm−2 are detected only toward the Central
Molecular Zone region. No high column density clumps with
N(H2)>1023 cm−2 are found in the outer Galaxy. There is no
clear trend between Category I and Category II clumps and their
location within the Galaxy. These two types of clumps are found
indistinctly across the Galaxy.

Figure 7 shows the column density weighted temperature,
Tweighted, distribution of the ECC clumps as a function of Galac-
tic longitude and Galactocentric distance. It shows similar trends
as the distribution of the maximum column density values. ECC
objects in the Galactic center show higher temperatures (by more
than 5 K diﬀerence). For the clumps with Galactocentric dis-
tances larger than 6 kpc, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the
calculated temperature between clumps with (in red) and without
(in black) 70 µm sources. For Galactocentric distances shorter
than 6 kpc, we have too few sources to draw conclusions. The
weighted temperature outside the molecular ring is ∼13 K, val-

ues larger than 14.5 K are detected only within the molecular
ring.

3.5. Comparison of Planck and Hi-GAL temperatures

In Figure 8, we make the comparison between the clump dust
temperature calculated from Planck data, TECC, and the column
density weighted average dust temperature derived from the Her-
schel images, Tweighted. The Planck and Herschel based temper-
atures agree within ±3 K, except for the warmer sources in the
Galactic center region, where our column density criteria select
a much larger region than the Planck clump size and includes
warmer regions. The average temperatures in the inner Galaxy
are 10.4 K and 15.4 K based on the Planck and Herschel data,
respectively. The same values are 11.8 K and 12.5 K in the outer
part of our Galaxy. We note that there is one outlier clump in
the outer Galaxy without any 70 µm emission (G201.26+00.46),
for which the Planck based temperature is higher by ∼5 K with
respect to the average temperature derived from Herschel data.
A bright 70 µm-emission region with high dust temperatures is
visible toward the south-west from the clump. The Planck ECC
size is larger than the denser region used in the Herschel-based
calculation, which causes lower weighted temperature for the
Herschel data. This comparison shows that the Planck ECC tem-
peratures are, in most cases, a reasonable approximation for the
average temperatures of the high column density regions of the
cores. Temperatures derived from the integrated Herschel ﬂuxes
within the two column density contours that we used in the paper
lead to the same conclusion.

4. Discussion
In this Section, we evaluate the potential of forming massive
stars and star clusters by the selected Planck cold clumps and
determine their evolutionary stage. This is done by using the
column density maps and bolometric luminosities based on the
Herschel observations. In Section 4.1 we investigate the fraction
of mass in the densest parts of the clumps compared to their sur-
rounding, more diﬀuse regions, while in Section 4.2 we identify
the clumps with on-going massive star formation as probed by
70 µm emission. Kauﬀmann & Pillai (2010) showed that regions
forming massive stars are, at a given radius, more massive than
the limit mass (mlim[r]=870M(cid:12)[r/pc]1.33) and thus, we evaluate
the fraction of Planck cold clumps with potential to form mas-
sive stars and star clusters. In Section 4.3 we ﬁnally investigate
the evolutionary stage of the clumps by comparing their Lbol -
Menv values with the theoretical evolutionary tracks calculated
by Molinari et al. (2008).

4.1. Mass distribution

As mentioned in Section 3.3, the clump masses and sizes were
calculated from the Hi-GAL column density maps by consid-
ering two diﬀerent H2 column density thresholds of 3×1021 and
1022 cm−2. The comparison of the masses contained within these
levels gives us information about the fraction of gas mass locked
into the densest parts of the clumps and the total mass enclosed
within the surrounding region. This parameter may be important
since it is possible to increase the dense core’s total mass through
the accretion of this lower-column density material.

Figure 9 shows the mass distribution of the sources as a func-
tion of Galactocentric distance. The top panel shows the total

mass associated with a column density limit of 3×1021 cm−2,
while the bottom panel shows the mass contained within the
high column density gas, N(H2) > 1022cm−2. Solid lines show
the range of masses and Galactocentric distances for the sources
with large distance discrepancies. No sources with mass above
104 M(cid:12) were detected at a Galactocentric distance larger than 6
kpc. All the densest clumps with N(H2) > 1022cm−2 are found
within 9 kpc to the Galactic Center.
Figure 10 shows the size and mass ratio for the two column
density thresholds considered, 3×1021 cm−2 and 1022 cm−2, and
the mass ratio as a function of Galactocentric distance. The ECC
clumps with a Galactocentric distance of > 9 kpc do not have
high column density gas in our sample. The fraction of the mass
in the densest parts of the nearby Planck clumps is lower than
that of the more massive clumps closer to the Galactic Center.
We also note that the densest regions tend to be more compact
(i.e. smaller in spatial extent) for the clumps in the outer Galaxy
than for the clumps in the inner Galaxy. This is likely a conse-
quence of the higher overall H2 column densities found in the
inner Galaxy (by more than a factor of 10) with respect to the
outer Galaxy.

4.2. Mass-size relation
By using solar neighbourhood clouds devoid of massive star for-
mation, Kauﬀmann & Pillai (2010) found an empirical mass-size
threshold above which massive star formation can occur. Re-
gions forming massive stars must thus be, at a given radius, more
massive than the limit mass (mlim[r]=870M(cid:12)[r/pc]1.33). In Fig-
ure 11, we show the mass-size diagram for the selected Planck

cold clumps based on their Herschel data. Solid lines indicate
the range of masses and radii for the sources with large dis-
tance discrepancies. They all located below the empirical mass-
size threshold of massive star formation. 25% of the Planck
ECC clumps in the Galactic Plane with Herschel-based derived
masses have the potential to form massive stars since these
masses lie above the mass limit proposed by Kauﬀmann & Pil-
lai (2010). These ECC clumps are the most massive and also the
largest in size among our sample, which is consistent with the
idea that massive stars tend to form in the largest, most mas-
sive clumps (Wang et al. 2009). Their distances are quite typi-
cal for the sample, between 1.1 kpc and 6.04 kpc. We note that
three out of the these clumps do not have 70 µm point sources
(G006.96+00.89, G009.79+00.87 and G354.81+00.35), which
makes them good candidates to study the earliest stages of star-
formation. Two of the sources above the mass limit are in the
outer Galaxy (G224.27-00.82 and G224.47-00.65), but they con-
tain 70µm point sources already, which conﬁrms their ability to
form stars.

In addition, we can investigate the possible evolution of the
clumps’ mass by calculating the ECC clump masses and sizes
contained within ﬁve diﬀerent H2 column density thresholds:
1021, 3×1021, 5×1021, 8×1021 and 1022 cm−2. The bottom panel
of Figure 11 show the mass-size relationship. The lines repre-
sent the evolution of the calculated values within the diﬀerent
thresholds. As shown in Figure 11, the lines are almost parallel
to the mass-size threshold. This demonstrates that the number
of sources with the potential to form high mass stars does not
depend on the selected column density threshold.

Red symbols indicate the clumps without 70 µm point sources.

We stress that two clumps are found in the Outer Galaxy
which fulﬁll the criteria of high mass star formation. Their
masses and sizes based on the Planck catalogue information also
fulﬁll this criteria. Three clumps without 70 µm emission are
found above the high mass star formation threshold in the in-
ner Galaxy. These clumps represent good candidates to study
the earliest phases of massive star and star cluster formation.

5. Summary
In this paper we investigate the basic physical properties of 48
Planck ECC clumps in the Galactic Plane using Herschel Hi-
GAL data. Starless (∼22%) and star-forming (∼78%) clumps
were identiﬁed in the inner and outer part of the Galaxy. We
have calculated their masses and sizes based on background
subtracted Herschel images and characterized their evolution-
ary stage based on the presence, or absence, of point-like 70 µm
emission (an excellent probe of massive star formation). No clear
diﬀerence was found in the mass and temperature of starless and
star forming clumps based on our data. Planck clumps located
in the Galactic center show higher column densities and aver-
age dust temperatures than those located in the outer Galaxy.
We identiﬁed 5 particularly interesting objects in the Galactic
Plane, which are good candidates for higher resolution contin-
uum and molecular line studies. Three of them (G006.96+00.89,
G009.79+00.87 and G354.81+00.35) are located in the inner
Galaxy, fulﬁll the criteria of massive star and star cluster for-
mation and show no 70 µm emission. These objects are thus
excellent templates where to study the earliest phases of mas-
sive star and star cluster formation. Two objects with 70 µm
emission (G224.27-00.82 and G224.47-00.65) were found in the

Appendix A: Herschel images of the clumps

In Figure A.1-A.8, we show the Herschel 70, 250 and 500 µm
images of the investigated Planck ECC objects (intensity scale in
units of MJy/sr) with a resolution of 5(cid:48)(cid:48), 18(cid:48)(cid:48) and 36(cid:48)(cid:48). Black cir-
cles are centered at the Planck clumps’ positions and their sizes
correspond to the derived major axis of the clumps.

Fig. A.1. Herschel 70, 250 and 500 µm images of the 48 selected Planck
cold clumps given in units of MJy/sr with a resolution of 5(cid:48)(cid:48), 18(cid:48)(cid:48) and
36(cid:48)(cid:48). Black circles are centered at the position of the Planck clumps’
positions and the circle sizes correspond to the derived major axis of
the clumps.

Fig. A.2. Hershel 70, 250 and 500 µm images in MJy/sr with a resolu-
tion of 5(cid:48)(cid:48), 18(cid:48)(cid:48) and 36(cid:48)(cid:48). Black circle shows the Planck clump’s position
and size based on the major axis.

Appendix B: Available distance estimates for the

clumps

Table 1 shows all the available estimated distances for the ECC
objects, see the detailed description in Section 2.3.

Appendix C: Background subtraction
For the precise determination of clump masses and sizes, we
have to subtract the background and foreground emission in the

observed images. Diﬀerent methods are available to perform this
task: i) the Fourier Transform (FT) method, which separates the
large-scale and small-scale structures (Wang et al. 2015); ii) to
use a reference, relatively emission-free region to derive a con-
stant background value (Juvela et al. 2012); and iii) to perform
the Gaussian ﬁtting of the Galactic background along the Galac-
tic latitude (Battersby et al. 2011).
For the background subtraction, we used 2◦×2◦ maps around
the central positions of the Planck cold clumps. These maps
are much larger than the structures of interest. We smoothed

all intensity images to the same resolution of 5’ and used the
smoothed map as background. In contrast to methods ii) and iii),
this technique allows spatial variations in the background values
across the maps. After background subtraction, the derived col-
umn densities are 15-20% lower and the dust temperatures are
1-3 K lower. We compared our method with the FT method in-
troduced by Wang et al. (2015). Our column density values are
in good agreement with the FT method, and the diﬀerence is

Figure D.1-D.8 shows the Herschel 70 µm images ([MJy/sr], left
panels), the calculated column density ([cm−2], middle panels)

in logarithmic scale and the dust temperature maps ([K], right
panels) for the ECC sources with a resolution of 36(cid:48)(cid:48). The cal-
culation was based on the background subtracted Herschel 160

sition) and size (major axis given in the ECC catalogue) of the
Planck clumps. Yellow and red contour levels refer to the H2 col-
umn density thresholds of 3×1021 and 1022 cm−2, respectively.
