Representations of Gaussian random ﬁelds and
approximation of elliptic PDEs with lognormal

coeﬃcients ∗

March 18, 2016

Abstract

Approximation of elliptic PDEs with random diﬀusion coeﬃcients typically re-
quires a representation of the diﬀusion ﬁeld in terms of a sequence y = (yj)j≥1
of scalar random variables. One may then apply high-dimensional approximation
methods to the solution map y (cid:55)→ u(y). Although Karhunen-Lo`eve representa-
tions are commonly used, it was recently shown, in the relevant case of lognormal
diﬀusion ﬁelds, that they do not generally yield optimal approximation rates. Mo-
tivated by these results, we construct wavelet-type representations of stationary
Gaussian random ﬁelds deﬁned on bounded domains. The size and localization
properties of these wavelets are studied, and used to obtain polynomial approxima-
tion results for the related elliptic PDE which outperform those achievable when
using Karhunen-Lo`eve representations. Our construction is based on a periodic
extension of the random ﬁeld, and the expansion on the domain is then obtained
by simple restriction. This makes the approach easily applicable even when the
computational domain of the PDE has a complicated geometry. In particular, we
apply this construction to the class of Gaussian processes deﬁned by the family of
Mat´ern covariances.

Introduction

Stochastic PDEs are commonly used to model uncertain physical phenomena. One such
model that is used, for instance, in groundwater modeling is the diﬀusion equation

− div(a∇u) = f in D,

u|∂D = 0,

(1)

with lognormally distributed coeﬃcient, that is, a = exp(b), where b is a centered Gaus-
sian random ﬁeld deﬁned on the computational domain D ⊂ Rd (where typically d = 2
or d = 3).

Uncertainty quantiﬁcation aims at describing the statistical properties of the resulting
solution u, with various computational objectives: evaluating the mean ﬁeld ¯u = E(u),

estimating a plausible a based on some measurement data of the solution, describing the
law of a scalar quantity of interest Q(u).

For such objectives, it is most convenient to represent b in the form of an expansion

b =

yjψj,

(2)

(cid:88)

j≥1

(cid:90)

where yj are i.i.d. N (0, 1), that is, independent scalar standard Gaussian random vari-
ables, and ψj are suitable functions on D. Once such an expansion is given, one may
introduce approximations to the solution map

y (cid:55)→ u(y),

y = (yj)j≥1,

(3)

for example by multivariate polynomials in the variables yj. Such approximations provide
a fast way to evaluate u(y) for any choice of y up to some prescribed accuracy, which is
of crucial help for the above mentioned tasks. Expansions of the form (2) can also be
of practical use for the fast generation of trajectories, provided that the ψj have simple
analytic expressions or are easy to compute numerically.

The Gaussian ﬁeld b is characterized by its covariance function
x, x(cid:48) ∈ D.

(x, x(cid:48)) (cid:55)→ K(x, x(cid:48)) = E(b(x) b(x(cid:48))),

(4)

A standard way of obtaining a representation (2) is by using the Karhunen-Lo`eve (KL)
basis, that is, the L2(D)-orthonormal eigenfunctions (ϕj)j≥1 of the integral operator

T : v (cid:55)→ T v =

K(·, z) v(z) dz,

(5)
with corresponding eigenvalues λj ≥ 0 arranged in decreasing order. One then obtains
(2) by setting

D

ψj :=(cid:112)λjϕj.

(6)

The distinguishing feature of this particular choice is that in addition to the statistical
orthogonality E(yjyk) = δj,k, the functions ψj are orthogonal in L2(D). However, other
expansions of the form (2) may also be considered if one does not impose the L2(D)-
orthogonality.
As shown in [23], general expansions of the form (2) with i.i.d. N (0, 1) coeﬃcients are
characterized by the fact that the ψj form a tight frame of the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS) H induced by K. Recall that H is the the closure of the ﬁnite linear
combinations of the functions Kz := K(·, z) for z ∈ D, with respect to the norm induced
by the inner product (cid:104)Kx, Kz(cid:105)H := K(x, z), see [1] for a general treatment. Recall also
that a tight frame of a Hilbert space H is a complete system that satisﬁes the identity

|(cid:104)g, ψj(cid:105)H|2 = (cid:107)g(cid:107)2H,

g ∈ H.

(7)

(cid:88)

We refer to [11] for classical examples of time-frequency or time-scale frames. In contrast
to orthonormal bases, such systems may be redundant. The possible redundancy in (2)
can be illustrated by following trivial example: if y1 and y2 are i.i.d. N (0, 1) and ψ is a
√
given function, then y1ψ + y2ψ = z(

√
2ψ) with z = (y1 + y2)/

2 also N (0, 1).

As an elementary yet useful example of the diﬀerent possibilities for expanding a
Gaussian process, consider the Brownian bridge on D = [0, 1] whose covariance is given
by K(x, x(cid:48)) = min{x, x(cid:48)} − xx(cid:48). On the one hand, the representation based on the KL
expansion is given by the trigonometric functions

ψj(x) :=

sin(πjx),

j ≥ 1.

On the other hand, another classical representation of this process is given by the
Schauder basis, which consists of the hat functions

(cid:96) ≥ 0,

k = 0, . . . , 2(cid:96) − 1,

ψj(x) := 2−(cid:96)/2σ(2(cid:96)x − k),

(9)
where σ(x) = (1−|2x−1|)+. Both systems are orthonormal bases (and thus tight frames)

Suﬃcient conditions have been established, either in terms of the covariance function K
or of the size properties of the ψj, which ensure that the solution map y (cid:55)→ u(y) belongs
to Lk(U, V, γ) for all k < ∞, see [10, 6, 17, 21, 3]. Here Lk(U, V, γ) is the usual Bochner
space where γ denotes the countable tensor product of the univariate standard Gaussian
measure.

In turn, approximation can be obtained in L2(U, V, γ), corresponding to mean-square

convergence, by truncation of the tensor product Hermite expansion

uνHν(y),

Here we have denoted by (Hn)n≥0 the sequence of univariate Hermite polynomials with
e−t2/2, and by F the set of ﬁnitely sup-
normalization in L2(R, g(t)dt) where g(t) = 1√
ported sequences ν = (νj)j≥1 of non-negative integers.
The best error for a given number n of terms retained in the above expansion is
attained by the so-called best n-term Hermite approximation y (cid:55)→ un(y) obtained by
retaining the indices ν corresponding to the n largest (cid:107)uν(cid:107)V . By combining Parseval’s
identity with Stechkin’s lemma [13], the resulting error can be quantiﬁed in terms of the
(cid:96)p-summability of the sequence ((cid:107)uν(cid:107)V )ν∈F for p < 2, namely

(12)

As shown in [3], this extra summability may depend strongly on the particular represen-
tation (2) that is used, or in other words, on the choice of coordinates (yj)j≥1. Whereas
previous results establishing summability properties of ((cid:107)uν(cid:107)V )ν∈F are based only on the
summability of ((cid:107)ψj(cid:107)L∞(D))j≥1, that is, on the absolute sizes of the ψj, the results in [2, 3]
also take into account the localization properties of ψj. More speciﬁcally, the following
is shown in [3].

Then the solution map y (cid:55)→ u(y) belongs to Lk(U, V, γ) for all 0 ≤ k < ∞. Moreover,
((cid:107)uν(cid:107)V )ν∈F ∈ (cid:96)p(F).

(ρ−1

The above result draws an important distinction between representations using glob-
ally or locally supported functions ψj. If nothing is assumed on the supports of ψj, we
may only apply the following immediate consequence of Theorem 1.1.

Corollary 1.2. If (ψj)j≥1 is a family of functions with arbitrary support such that
((cid:107)ψj(cid:107)L∞)j≥1 belongs to (cid:96)r(N) for some r < 1, then best n-term Hermite approximations
converge in L2(U, V, γ) with rate n−s for s = 1

r − 1.

Consider for example the above mentioned Brownian bridge. On the one hand, the
KL functions given by (8) are globally supported with size of order j−1. In turn, for any
q < ∞, there exists no sequence (ρj)j≥1 satisfying (13) and (14), and therefore the best
n-term truncation cannot be proved to converge with any algebraic rate. On the other
hand, the Schauder functions given by (9) have local support properties which allow us
to fulﬁll (13) with ρj = js for any s < 1
2. Hence best n-term Hermite truncation based
on the Schauder representation is ensured to converge with rate n−s for any s < 1
2.
The same analysis applies to a general process on a bounded domain D ⊂ Rd if it
admits an expansion (2) where the ψj have wavelet-like localization properties. In this
case, it is convenient to index the basis functions ψj by a scale-space index λ, with |λ|
denoting the corresponding scale level. We denote by I the set of these indices, where
#{λ ∈ I : |λ| = (cid:96)} ∼ 2d(cid:96) for (cid:96) ≥ 0.

Corollary 1.3. Let (ψj)j≥1 = (ψλ)λ∈I be a wavelet basis such that for some α > 0,

|ψλ(x)| ≤ C2−α(cid:96),

(cid:96) ≥ 0.

α, then the best n-term Hermite

This leads to the question whether suitable wavelet-type systems (ψj)j≥1 forming
orthonormal bases or tight frames of H can also be found for more general b with given
covariance kernel K.
In view of the above corollary, we are interested in the decay
exponent α that can be ensured in (15). For practical purposes, we also need these
systems to either have exact analytic expressions or be computable by simple and eﬃcient
numerical procedures.

We shall focus on stationary random ﬁelds, that is, covariances of the form

K(x, x(cid:48)) = k(x − x(cid:48)),

x, x(cid:48) ∈ D,

(16)

where k is an even function deﬁned over Rd which is the inverse Fourier transform of
a positive measure. One typical class of examples is given by the family of Mat´ern

The parameters ν and λ quantify the smoothness and correlation length, respectively, of
the process.

The idea of using wavelet-type systems for the representation of Gaussian processes
was put forward in the pioneering works of Ciesielski [7], motivated by the problem of
analyzing the H¨older smoothness of univariate Gaussian processes. This program was
pursued in [8] where Sobolev-Besov smoothness was investigated, in particular for the
fractional Brownian motion. These papers were based on representing the processes of
interest in the Schauder basis, with resulting components that are generally not indepen-
dent and therefore not of the form (2).

A general approach was proposed in [4] to obtain wavelet-type representations of Gaus-
sian processes deﬁned on Rd, with independent components. This approach requires that
the covariance function is the Green’s function of an operator of pseudo-diﬀerential type,
and it includes Mat´ern covariances, see also [9]. A related approach was proposed in [15]
for stationary Gaussian processes, motivated by fast methods for generating trajectories.
Both approaches strongly rely on the Fourier transform over Rd, and do not carry over
in a simple manner to the case of a bounded domain D ⊂ Rd.

A general construction of wavelet expansions of the form (2) for Gaussian processes
was recently proposed in [22], in the general framework of Dirichlet spaces. Here the
needed assumptions are that the covariance operator commutes with the operator that
deﬁnes the Dirichlet structure. The latter does not have a simple explicit form in the case
of Mat´ern covariances on a domain D, which makes this approach diﬃcult to analyze
and implement in our setting. Let us also mention the construction in [18], where an
orthonormal basis for the RKHS is built by a direct Gram-Schmidt process, however,
with generally no size and localization bounds on the resulting basis functions.

In the present paper, we propose an approach where the complications that may arise
due to the geometry of D are circumvented by performing a periodic continuation of the
random ﬁeld b on a larger torus T. The existence of such a continuation is discussed
in §2. This leads to a simple construction of KL-type and wavelet-type expansions,
by restrictions to D of similar expansions deﬁned on T. While the systems introduced
on T are bases, their restriction to D are redundant frames of the RKHS, the amount
of redundancy being essentially reﬂected by the ratio |T|/|D|. Our construction thus
achieves numerical simplicity at the price of redundancy.

5

The periodic continuation has some parallels to circulant embedding, proposed inde-
pendently in [14] and [28] as an algebraic technique for evaluating a stationary Gaussian
random ﬁeld, given by k, at the points of a uniform grid. Here, the (block) Toeplitz ma-
trix formed by the grid values of k is embedded into a (block) circulant matrix, enabling
a factorization by fast Fourier transform. Although it was shown in [12] that a positive
deﬁnite Toeplitz matrix can always be embedded into a suﬃciently large positive deﬁ-
nite circulant matrix, its required size depends on the particular k under consideration,
similarly to the size of T in our construction. Under more restrictive assumptions on k,
simple procedures produce an embedding into a matrix of size proportional to the original
one [14]. This strategy has also been applied in the numerical treatment of lognormal
diﬀusion problems by quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods [19].

Also in the setting of sampling-based methods such as QMC, our results have several
potentially advantageous features. They yield a periodically extended random ﬁeld on all
of D, rather than on a uniform spatial grid. Any further approximation (e.g. on unstruc-
tured ﬁnite element meshes) can thus be adjusted independently of the periodic extension
and of a chosen expansion of the random ﬁeld. Furthermore, the decay properties of the
KL eigenvalues of the periodic process are directly controlled by the decay of the Fourier
transform of k.
In the case of KL-type expansions, which are studied in §3, the functions ψj that we
obtain are simply the restrictions to D of trigonometric functions. This is an advantage in
term of numerical simplicity compared to the L2(D)-orthogonal KL functions of b which
may not be easy to compute accurately, and in addition may not satisfy uniform L∞
bounds. Wavelet-type expansions are deﬁned in §4, and we establish their localization
and size properties. In the case of Mat´ern covariances, they correspond to the value α = ν
in (15), where ν is the smoothness parameter in (18). Therefore, corresponding best n-
term Hermite approximations converge with algebraic rate n−s for any 0 < s < ν/d.
Finally, in §5 details are given on numerical procedures which may be applied to deﬁne
the periodic continuation and to construct the resulting wavelets, in the case of Mat´ern
covariance, depending on the parameters λ, ν.

2 Periodic continuation of a stationary process
Let (b(x))x∈Rd be a real valued, stationary and centered Gaussian process deﬁned on Rd,
whose covariance is thus of the form

E(b(x)b(x(cid:48))) = k(x − x(cid:48)),

(20)

where k is a real valued and even function which is the inverse Fourier transform of a
non-negative measure ˆk. We work under the assumption that ˆk is a function such that

0 ≤ ˆk(ω) ≤ C(1 + |ω|2)−r, ω ∈ Rd,

(21)

for some r > d/2 and C > 0. Obviously, the Mat´ern covariances (17) satisfy this
assumption with r = ν + d/2 and C depending on (d, λ, ν). We consider the restricted
process (b(x))x∈D deﬁned on the bounded domain D of interest.
We aim for representations of the general form (2) where the yj are i.i.d. N (0, 1)
and the (ψj)j≥1 are a given sequence of functions deﬁned on D. As explained in the

6

introduction, one natural choice is ψj = (cid:112)λjϕj, where (ϕj, λj) are the eigenfunctions

and eigenvalues of the covariance operator. However, this renormalized KL representation
may not meet our requirements due to the possibly global support of the ψj and due to
the slow decay of their L∞ norms, while other representations could be more appropriate.
Our strategy for deriving better representations of the process over D is to view it
as the restriction to D of a periodic stationary Gaussian process bp deﬁned on a suitable
larger torus T. As a consequence, any representation

bp =

yj

˜ψj,

(22)

(cid:88)

j≥1

with yj i.i.d. N (0, 1) and ( ˜ψj)j≥1 a given system of functions, yields a representation

b =

yjψj, ψj := ˜ψj|D.

The construction of bp requires additional assumptions on the covariance function k.
Let δ := diam(D), so that in a suitable coordinate system, D can be embedded
into the box [− δ
2]d. We want to construct a periodic process (bp(x))x∈T on a torus
T = [−γ, γ]d with γ > δ, whose restriction on D agrees with b, that is, bp|D ∼ b. This is
feasible provided that we can ﬁnd an even and T-periodic function kp which agrees with
k over [−δ, δ]d and such that the Fourier coeﬃcients

2, δ

cn(kp) :=

kp(z) e

γ n·z dz, n ∈ Zd,

(24)

are positive. In addition we would like that these Fourier coeﬃcients have a similar rate
of decay as the function ˆk, that is,

for some C > 0. Note that kp generally diﬀers from the periodization(cid:80)

0 ≤ cn(kp) ≤ C(1 + |n|2)−r, n ∈ Zd,

(25)
n∈Zd k(· + 2γn),

which corresponds to a periodic process that does not agree with b on D.
One natural way of constructing the function kp is by truncation and periodization:
ﬁrst we choose a suﬃciently smooth and even cutoﬀ function φ : Rd → R, to be speciﬁed
further, such that φ|[−δ,δ]d = 1 and φ(x) = 0 for x /∈ [−κ, κ]d where κ := 2γ − δ, and
deﬁne the truncation

We now deﬁne kp as the periodization of kt, that is,

n∈Zd
Obviously, kp agrees with k over [−δ, δ]d, and

kp(z) =

kt(z + 2γn).

kt(z) := k(z) φ(z).

ˆkt = (2π)−d ˆk ∗ ˆφ,

(29)

(30)

it is easily seen that the upper inequality in (29) follows from the upper inequality in

The main problem is to guarantee the lower inequality in (29), that is, the non-negativity
ˆφ(ω)dω, the

non-negativity of ˆφ would imply that
|φ(x)| = (2π)−d

It follows that for any such φ, the convolution operator

v (cid:55)→ v ∗ ˆφ,

x (cid:54)= 0,

(33)

(34)

does not preserve positivity for all functions v. Here, we are only interested in preserving
positivity for the particular function ˆk. However, the following result shows that this is
in general not feasible only under the assumption (21).

Theorem 2.1. For any r > d/2, there exists an even function k that satisﬁes (21) and
such that for any φ satisfying | ˆφ(ω)| ≤ C(1+|ω|2)−s for some s > r, φ|[−δ,δ]d = 1, φ(x) = 0
for x /∈ [−κ, κ]d for some κ > δ, the function ˆkt = (2π)−d ˆk ∗ ˆφ is not non-negative.
Proof. Let h be a non-negative, smooth, even function on Rd with h(0) = 1 and support
contained in the unit ball. For (cid:96) ∈ N, we choose arbitrary but ﬁxed ω(cid:96) ∈ Rd such that
|ω(cid:96)| = 2(cid:96). We now deﬁne k by its Fourier transform as

2−2r(cid:96)(cid:16)

h(cid:0)(cid:96)(ω − ω(cid:96))(cid:1) + h(cid:0)(cid:96)(ω + ω(cid:96))(cid:1)(cid:17)

Then clearly, (21) is satisﬁed. As demonstrated above, there exists ω∗ ∈ Rd such that
ˆφ(ω∗) < 0. For (cid:96) > 1, consider

ˆφ(ω∗ − ξ) ˆk(ξ + ω(cid:96)) dξ = (2π)−d(cid:0)I1((cid:96)) + I2((cid:96))(cid:1),

For (cid:96) such that 2(cid:96)−2 > 2|ω∗|, we thus have

Therefore

(cid:96)→∞ (cid:96)d22r(cid:96)|I2((cid:96))| = 0.
As a consequence, ˆkt(ω∗ + ω(cid:96)) < 0 for suﬃciently large (cid:96).

The above counterexample reveals that further assumptions are needed on the covari-

ance function k. Speciﬁcally, we work under the stronger assumptions

c(1 + |ω|2)−s ≤ ˆk(ω) ≤ C(1 + |ω|2)−r,

for some s ≥ r > d/2 and 0 < c ≤ C, and

Remark 2.2. In the case of the Mat´ern covariance (17) with parameters ν, λ > 0, the
assumption (41) holds with s = r = ν + d/2 as a consequence of (18). The assumption
(42) actually holds for all derivation orders α, as a consequence of the exponential decay
of the modiﬁed Bessel functions of the second kind Kν and of their derivatives. This
exponential decay can be seen, for example, from the integral representation

Kν(x) =

e−x cosh t cosh νt dt,

Theorem 2.3. Let k be an even function such that (41) and (42) hold. Then for κ > δ
suﬃciently large, there exists φ satisfying (31), φ|[−δ,δ]d = 1, and φ(x) = 0 for x /∈ [−κ, κ]d
such that ˆkt = (2π)−d ˆk ∗ ˆφ is non-negative.

Proof. We ﬁrst choose a function φ2δ ∈ C 2p(Rd) with p := (cid:100)s(cid:101), supported on [−2δ, 2δ]d
and such that φ2δ|[−δ,δ]d = 1. Then for each κ ≥ 2δ, we deﬁne

We thus have, for all κ ≥ 2δ,

φκ(x) = φ2δ(2δx/κ).

Note that φκ satisﬁes (31) with a constant C that depends on κ. For a value of κ to be
ﬁxed further, we take φ := φκ, and let θ := 1 − φ. Then

ˆkt(ω) = ˆk(ω) −(cid:99)kθ(ω) ≥ c(1 + |ω|2)−s −(cid:99)kθ(ω),
(cid:90)

|(I − ∆)p(kθ)| dx ≤ (1 + |ω|2)−s

|α|≤2p

|x|>κ/2

|∂αk(x)| dx.

Since limκ→∞ C(κ) = 0 by (42), it follows that ˆkt is non-negative for κ chosen large
enough such that C(κ) ≤ c.

Let us recall that the standard Karhunen-Lo`eve (KL) decomposition of the stationary
Gaussian process b has the form (2) with

:=(cid:112)λj ϕj,

ψj = ψKL

where (λj)j≥1 is the sequence of positive eigenvalues of the covariance operator

arranged in decreasing order, and (ϕj)j≥1 is the associated L2(D)-orthonormal basis of
eigenfunctions.

D

Working under assumptions (41) and (42), the periodized construction described in the
previous section provides us with an alternative decomposition based on the covariance
operator associated to the periodized process bp, that is,

Tp : v (cid:55)→ Tpv =

kp(· − x) v(x) dx,

(51)
with T = [−γ, γ]d. The L2(T)-orthonormal eigenfunctions of this operator are explicitly
given by the trigonometric functions

The eigenvalues are related to the Fourier coeﬃcients cn(kp) deﬁned in (24). For the above
eigenfunction θn, with each ni being either of the form 2mi or 2mi − 1, the corresponding
eigenvalue is

cm(kp), m = (m1, . . . , md).

(54)

We denote by (λp,j)j≥1 a decreasing rearrangement of these eigenvalues, with correspond-
ing eigenfunctions (ϕp,j)j≥1. We may thus write

where the yj are i.i.d. N (0, 1) and

Since bp ∼ b on D, this yields a decomposition of b by restriction, that is, taking

Note that from (25) we obtain a decay estimate of the form

λp,j ≤ Cj− 2r
d ,

j ≥ 1,

for some C > 0. One ﬁrst observation is that a similar decay estimate holds for the
original eigenvalues λj.

Theorem 3.1. If the covariance function satisﬁes (41) and (42), then we have

for some C > 0.

Proof. We denote by

λj ≤ Cj− 2r

j ≥ 1,

Vn = span{ϕ1, . . . , ϕn},

(60)

the spaces generated by the Karhunen-Lo`eve functions. These spaces satisfy the opti-

the spaces generated by the KL functions of bp, we denote by
Wn := span{ϕp,1|D, . . . , ϕp,n|D}

where the second inequality follows from (58). Since the λj are positive non-increasing,
this implies the decay estimate (59).

Remark 3.2. In the case of the Mat´ern covariance, in view of (18), we therefore obtain
(59) with the value r := ν +d/2. This estimate was derived in [20] by a diﬀerent approach,
using the theory developed by Widom for the eigenvalues of convolution-type operators.
This theory makes the assumption that ˆk is unimodal in each variable, see [27, p. 290],
which holds for Mat´ern covariances, but is not needed in the above construction based
on assumptions (41) and (42).

One interest of using the representation based on the functions ψR

j deﬁned by re-
striction according to (57) is that the functions ϕp,j are explicitly given by tensorized
trigonometric functions. In particular, they are uniformly bounded. It follows that

(cid:107)ψR

j (cid:107)L∞ ≤ Cλ1/2
p,j ,

j ≥ 0,

(67)

and therefore, by (58),

(cid:107)ψR

j (cid:107)L∞ ≤ Cj− r
d ,

j ≥ 0.

(68)
In contrast, such uniform bounds for the L∞(D) norms are generally not available for
the KL functions ϕj, which are in addition not easily computable in the case of a general
multivariate domain.
In the particular case of Mat´ern covariances, the L∞ norms of these functions can
be estimated by an argument introduced in [20], which uses their natural connections
with Hilbertian Sobolev spaces. We brieﬂy recall this argument. Fixing an s such that
d
2 < s < r = ν + d/2, and assuming that the domain D satisﬁes the uniform cone
condition, we may use Sobolev embedding to obtain

(cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)L∞(D) ≤ C(cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)H s(D).

We then ﬁnd by interpolation that

(cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)L∞(D) ≤ C(cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)1−s/r

L2(D) (cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)s/r

H r(D) = C(cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)s/r

H r(D).

(69)

(70)

12

In order to estimate the H r(D) norms of the functions ϕj, we use the following bound
for the covariance operator T : for any v ∈ L2(D), denoting by w its extension by zero to
Rd, we have

(cid:107)T v(cid:107)2

H r(D) = (cid:107)(k ∗ w)|D(cid:107)2

where we have used the characterization of Hilbertian Sobolev spaces by Fourier trans-

This needs to be compared with (58), which in the present case of the Mat´ern covariance
yields

(cid:107)ψR

j (cid:107)L∞(D) ≤ Cj− r
d ,

since (cid:107)ϕp,j(cid:107)L∞(D) ≤ 1.
Let us mention that in the particular univariate case d = 1, numerical experiment
seem to indicate that (cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)L∞(D) stays bounded independently of j, and therefore that the
upper bound (72) is not always sharp. On the other hand, one can also exhibit examples
of stationary processes such that the corresponding KL functions on the domain D are not
uniformly bounded. Take for example the case D = [−1, 1] and k such that ˆk = χ[−F,F ]
for which the KL functions ϕj coincide with the univariate prolate spheroidal functions
introduced in [25]. It is known that these functions are uniformly close to the Legendre
polynomials Lj as j → ∞, which shows that (cid:107)ϕj(cid:107)L∞(D) ∼ j1/2, see [5].
j (cid:107)L∞(D)
than available for (cid:107)ψKL
j are easily computed numerically
while this is generally not the case for the ψKL
. However, (75) still leads to rather severe
restrictions on the values of r for which Theorem 1.1 is applicable via Corollary 1.2,
due to the global supports of the functions ψR
j . In the following section we consider an
alternative wavelet-type construction for which Theorem 1.1, with Corollary 1.3, yields
an approximation rate for corresponding solutions of u for any r > d
2 .

In summary, we have obtained substantially better bounds on the decay of (cid:107)ψR

j (cid:107)L∞(D), and in addition the ψR

4 Wavelet representations
Our starting point is an L2(R)-orthonormal wavelet basis, that is a basis of the form

{ϕ(· − n)}n∈Z ∪ {2(cid:96)/2ψ(2(cid:96) · −n)}(cid:96)≥0,n∈Z

(76)

where ϕ and ψ the scaling function and mother wavelet, respectively. For simplicity we
use the Meyer wavelets, whose construction is detailed in [11, 24], and for which

(77)

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

The functions ˆϕ and ˆψ may be chosen to be smooth, but for our purpose it will be enough
to assume that they have M uniformly bounded derivatives with an integer M ≥ d + 1.
Denoting ψ0 := ϕ and ψ1 := ψ, the multivariate scaling function and wavelets are

deﬁned by

Φ(x) := ϕ(x1)··· ϕ(xd),

Ψε(x) := ψε1(x1)··· ψεd(xd),

ε ∈ C,

where C := {0, 1}d \ {(0, . . . , 0)}. Then

{Φ(· − n) : n ∈ Zd} ∪ {Ψε,n,(cid:96) : n ∈ Zd, (cid:96) ≥ 0, ε ∈ C},
is an orthonormal basis of L2(Rd), where we have used the notation

(78)

(79)

(80)
We obtain an orthonormal basis of L2(T), by rescaling and periodization. This basis
consists of the constant scaling function

Ψε,n,(cid:96) := 2d(cid:96)/2Ψε(2(cid:96) · −n).

Φp(x) :=

(2γ)−d/2Ψε,n,(cid:96)

m∈Zd

for n ∈ {0, . . . , 2(cid:96) − 1}d, (cid:96) ≥ 0, ε ∈ C. From the Poisson summation formula, and the
support properties of ˆϕ and ˆψ, it is easily seen that the above wavelets, at a given scale
level (cid:96), are ﬁnite linear combinations of the Fourier exponentials en with (cid:107)n(cid:107)∞ ≤ 2(cid:96)+2. In
other words, they are trigonometric polynomials of degree at most 2(cid:96)+2 in each variable.
We now make the following general observation: let (gj)j≥1 be any orthonormal basis

of L2(T), with each basis function having the Fourier expansion

(81)

(82)

(83)

(84)

gj = (2γ)−d/2(cid:88)

cn(gj) en,

n∈Zd

where

en(z) := (2γ)−d/2ei π

γ n·z, n ∈ Zd.

14

Then, deﬁning the functions (¯gj)j≥1 by ¯gj := Sgj, where S is the ﬁltering operator

(cid:113)

v (cid:55)→ Sv := (2γ)−d/2(cid:88)
(cid:88)

n∈Zd

cn(kp) cn(v) en,

we obtain a decomposition

where the yj are i.i.d. N (0, 1), and therefore b =(cid:80)

yj ¯gj,

bp =

j≥1

j≥1 yj ¯gj|D.

We apply this procedure to the above described periodic wavelet basis, therefore

obtaining new periodic functions

¯Φp = SΦp

¯Ψp

ε,(cid:96),n := SΨp

ε,(cid:96),n,

and

(87)

function with value (2γ)−d/2(cid:112)c0(kp), and the functions ¯Ψp

which are adapted to the decomposition of bp. By construction ¯Φp is again a constant
ε,(cid:96),n are trigonometric polyno-
mials of degree at most 2(cid:96)+2 in each variable. We next study in more detail the size and
localization properties of these functions and show that they essentially behave like a
wavelet basis with normalization 2(cid:96)(d/2−r) in place of 2(cid:96)d/2. This geometric decay of the
L∞ norms, combined with the localization properties, will allow us to apply Theorem 1.1
and Corollary 1.3 for any value of r > d
2 .

Note that since kp has been obtained by periodizing the truncated function kt = kφ,
ε,(cid:96),n is obtained by ﬁrst deﬁning over Rd the

an equivalent construction of the functions ¯Ψp
rescaled and ﬁltered wavelets ¯Ψε,(cid:96),n according to

and then applying T-periodisation, that is,

(cid:98)¯Ψε,(cid:96),n(ω) = ˆk

(86)

(88)

(89)

(90)

(91)

(92)

We thus focus our attention on the size and localization properties of the functions ¯Ψε,(cid:96),n.
Note that these functions inherit from the wavelet basis the translation invariance
structure, since, at any given scale level (cid:96), the function ¯Ψε,(cid:96),n are translates by 2γ2−(cid:96)n of
¯Ψε,(cid:96),0. However, they do not inherit the dilation invariance structure, since the functions
¯Ψε,(cid:96),0 are not obtained by a simple rescaling of ¯Ψε,0,0. We introduce rescaled functions
Fε,(cid:96) such that

¯Ψε,(cid:96),0(x) = 2(cid:96)(d/2−r)Fε,(cid:96)(2(cid:96)x),

that is, Fε,(cid:96) is deﬁned by

Fε,(cid:96)(x) = 2−(cid:96)(d/2−r) ¯Ψε,(cid:96),0(2−(cid:96)x).

Our objective is now to show that the functions Fε,(cid:96) satisfy a uniform localization esti-
mate, independently of ε and (cid:96).

For this purpose, we require some additional assumptions on the covariance function,
namely that (41) holds with s = r, and that the partial derivatives of ˆk satisfy improved
decay estimates

|∂αˆk(ω)| ≤ C(1 + |ω|2)−(r+|α|/2),

|α| ≤ M,

15

for an M ≥ d + 1. It is easily seen that Mat´ern covariances satisfy such estimates, by
straightforward diﬀerentiation of (18).
Lemma 4.1. Let k satisfy (41), (42) with s = r and (92) with an integer M ≥ d + 1.
Then φ in Theorem 2.3 can be chosen such that

|∂αˆk

1
2

t (ω)| ≤ C(1 + |ω|)−(r+|α|),

0 ≤ |α| ≤ M.

(93)

Proof. We proceed exactly as in the proof of Theorem 2.3 to obtain a family of functions
φκ ∈ C 2p(Rd) for κ ≥ 2δ, supported on [−2δ, 2δ]d and such that φ2δ|[−δ,δ]d = 1, and
satisfying

(cid:107)∂αφκ(cid:107)L∞ ≤ D < ∞

max
|α|≤2p

(94)

for some D > 0, but here with p := (cid:100)r + M/2(cid:101).

As in the proof of Theorem 2.3, we obtain that for φ := φκ with κ suﬃciently large,

there exist ˜c, ˜C > 0 such that

˜c(1 + |ω|2)−r ≤ ˆkt(ω) ≤ ˜C(1 + |ω|2)−r.

Note that φ obtained in this manner satisﬁes

| ˆφ(ω)| ≤ C(1 + |ω|2)−p.

Since ˆkt = (2π)−d ˆk ∗ ˆφ, we have

|∂αˆkt(ω)| = (2π)−d|(∂αˆk ∗ ˆφ)(ω)| ≤ C(1 + |ω|2)−(r+|α|/2),

|α| ≤ M,

by the same argument used for the upper inequality in (29).

(95)

(96)

(97)

We now turn to (93). For α = 0, this simply follows from (92) combined with
(1 + |ω|2) ≤ (1 + |ω|)2. For α (cid:54)= 0 such that |α| ≤ M , we obtain by induction that ∂αˆk
is of the form

Theorem 4.2. Let k satisfy (41), (42) with s = r and (92) with an integer M ≥ d + 1,
and let φ be chosen as in Lemma 4.1. Then the functions Fε,(cid:96) satisfy

|Fε,(cid:96)(x)| ≤ C(1 + |x|)−M ,

(101)

for some C > 0 that is independent of (cid:96) and ε.

(102)

Proof. From its deﬁnition (91) we have

(cid:98)Fε,(cid:96)(ω) = 2(cid:96)(d/2+r)(cid:98)¯Ψε,(cid:96),0(2(cid:96)ω),
t (2(cid:96)ω)(cid:98)Ψε,(cid:96),0(2γ2(cid:96)ω) = (2γ)d/22(cid:96)rˆk
=⇒ (cid:98)Ψε(2γω) = 0.

and therefore by (88),

(cid:98)Fε,(cid:96)(ω) = (2γ)d/22(cid:96)(d/2+r)ˆk
where we have used the scaling relation between Ψε,(cid:96),0 and Ψε. The functions (cid:98)Fε,(cid:96) are

t (2(cid:96)ω)| ≤ C2−r(cid:96).

It follows that the derivatives ∂α(cid:98)Fε,(cid:96)(ω) are uniformly bounded, independently of (cid:96) and

ε, for all |α| ≤ M , which implies (101) since they are in addition uniformly compactly
supported.

As we shall show next, Theorem 4.2 implies that Corollary 1.3 can be applied to the
wavelet basis deﬁned by (89), that is, with the basis in the corollary chosen as the scaling
function ¯Φp and the wavelets ¯Ψp
Corollary 4.3. Under the assumptions of Theorem 4.2, for each (cid:96) ≥ 0 one has

ε,(cid:96),n ordered by increasing scale level.

Remark 4.4. In the estimate (107), the precise value of M enters only into the constant
C. For numerical purposes, however, larger values of M corresponding to stronger spatial
localization of the functions ¯Ψp
ε,(cid:96),n can be advantageous. Note that in the case of the
Mat´ern covariance, if φ ∈ C∞, then Lemma 4.1 can be applied for any integer M ≥ d + 1.
If in addition, we have ˆϕ, ˆψ ∈ C∞ for the functions generating the Meyer wavelets, then
Theorem 4.2 can be applied for any such M as well, and the resulting spatial decay of
¯Ψp

ε,(cid:96),n is faster than any polynomial order.

5 Numerical aspects

We now discuss in more concrete detail the periodic continuation and the resulting KL
and wavelet representations in the case of the Mat´ern covariances (17). In particular we
discuss how these representations can be eﬃciently computed by using FFT and show
some numerical examples which reveal the eﬀect of the parameters λ and ν of the Mat´ern
covariance. While these computational principles apply in any dimension, we work in
the univariate setting, both for the sake of notational simplicity and for visualization

purposes. Our computational domain is thus an interval(cid:3)− δ

(cid:2) for some δ > 0. Note

however that varying the correlation length parameter λ in (17) amounts to rescaling the
interval. Therefore we ﬁx δ = 1, that is

5.1 Truncation and positivity

(109)

(110)

(111)

We need to ﬁrst choose a φ satisfying the conditions in Theorem 2.3 such that kt = kφ
has nonnegative Fourier transform. One option, which yields φ ∈ C∞(R), is based on the
function θ deﬁned by

(cid:40)

θ(x) :=

Recall that κ = 2γ − δ > δ. In view of Theorem 2.3, in order to ensure ˆkt ≥ 0, it then
suﬃces to take γ suﬃciently large.

In order to illustrate the dependence of the required value of γ on the parameters
ν, λ of the Mat´ern covariance, we now describe, for any chosen value of γ, a simple
scheme for approximating ˆkt based on the discrete Fourier transform. Let L > κ (so that
supp kt ⊂ [−L, L]), and let N = 2J for some J > 0. We consider the approximation of ˆkt
by the trapezoidal rule,

ˆkt(ω) =

kt(x) e−iωx dx ≈ h

kt(xn)e−iωxn =: DL,N (ω),

We thus have the error representation

(113)

Thus, by making N and L large we may approximately compute ˆkt on an arbitrarily large
range of ω and with arbitrarily ﬁne sampling rate.

Since kt agrees on [−L, L] with its 2L-periodic extension, we have

kt(xn) =

kt(y) e−πiy(cid:96)/L dy

where C > 0 is independent of L and N .

Based on this approximation, we can check positivity of the obtained approximate
values DL,N (ωk) for each γ and combine this with a simple bisection scheme to obtain an
estimate of the minimum required value γmin for which ˆkt remains non-negative on the
chosen grid. As illustrated in Figure 1, we observe that γmin remains close to its lower
bound δ = 1 for ν, λ < 1, and shows approximately bilinear growth for larger ν, λ. In
other words, the continuation process requires a signiﬁcantly larger domain as smoothness
or correlation length increase. This also implies that the KL or wavelet frames of the
RKHS obtained in §3 and §4 become more redundant as these parameters increase.

5.2 Mat´ern wavelets

The Meyer scaling function and wavelet can be deﬁned by ﬁrst taking ˆϕ to be a non-
negative function such that

where β(ω) is a smooth and even function supported in [− 4π

One simple example with explicit expressions of ˆϕ and ˆψ, following the construction given
in [11], is

From these we now construct the one-dimensional versions of Φp and Ψp described
in §4. Recall that for the scaling function, Φp = (2γ)−1/2
ˆkt(0), which we can directly
approximate using (112). For the wavelets, it suﬃces to consider Ψp
ε,(cid:96),0 for each wavelet-
type ε and scale level (cid:96), since all further wavelets are obtained as translates of these
functions. In the present univariate case, there is only a single wavelet type ε = 1, and
we omit the corresponding subscript in what follows.

We now choose L in (112) as L = 2γ, that is, ωk = πk

at cost of order J2J . In other words, if we prescribe a grid size h ∼ 2−J , as a consequence
of (131) we can determine the values of the wavelets at any level (cid:96) at the grid points
up to an error of order hν, using h−1|log h| operations in total. Since the wavelets are
trigonometric polynomials, their values between grid points can be approximated with
similar order of accuracy by local polynomial interpolation of neighboring grid values.

As an illustration, we display in Figures 2 and 3 the obtained wavelets at scales
(cid:96) = 0, . . . , 5 for λ = 1 and (ν, γ) = (1/2, 3/2), (ν, γ) = (4, 5). Note that these wavelets
behave asymptotically similarly to standard wavelets in terms of scale invariance. As
expected the size decay in scale depends on ν.
