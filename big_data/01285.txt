Quantum phase slips (QPS) generate voltage ﬂuctuations in superconducting nanowires. Employ-
ing Keldysh technique and making use of the phase-charge duality arguments we develop a theory
of QPS-induced voltage noise in such nanowires. We demonstrate that quantum tunneling of the
magnetic ﬂux quanta across the wire yields quantum shot noise which obeys Poisson statistics and
is characterized by a power law dependence of its spectrum SΩ on the external bias. In long wires
SΩ decreases with increasing frequency Ω and vanishes beyond a threshold value of Ω at T → 0.
Quantum coherent nature of QPS noise yields non-monotonous dependence of SΩ on T at small Ω.

Keywords: phase slips, shot noise,

Can a superconductor generate voltage ﬂuctuations?
More speciﬁcally, if an external bias is applied to a su-
perconductor could the latter produce shot noise? Posing
these questions we, of course, imply that temperature T ,
characteristic frequencies and/or voltages as well as all
other relevant energy parameters remain well below the
superconducting gap, i.e. the superconductor is either in
or suﬃciently close to its quantum ground state.

At the ﬁrst sight, positive answers to both these ques-
tions can be rejected on fundamental grounds. Indeed, a
superconducting state is characterized by zero resistance,
i.e. a non-dissipative current below some critical value
can pass through the system. Hence, neither non-zero
average voltage nor voltage ﬂuctuations can be expected.
These simple considerations – although applicable to
bulk superconductors – become insuﬃcient in the case of
ultrathin superconducting wires because of the presence
of quantum phase slips (QPS) [1–4]. In such wires quan-
tum ﬂuctuations of the superconducting order parameter
ﬁeld ∆ = |∆|eiϕ play an important role being responsi-
ble for temporal local suppression of |∆| inside the wire
and, hence, for the phase slippage process. Each quan-
tum phase slip event corresponds to the net phase jump
by δϕ = ±2π implying positive or negative voltage pulse
δV = ˙ϕ/2e (here and below we set  = 1) and tunneling
of one magnetic ﬂux quantum Φ0 ≡ π/e = R |δV (t)|dt

across the wire in the direction perpendicular to its axis.
Biasing the wire by an external current I one breaks the
symmetry between positive and negative voltage pulses
making the former more likely than the latter. As a re-
sult, the net voltage drop V occurs across the wire also
implying non-zero resistance R = V /I which may not
vanish down to lowest T [5, 6], as it was indeed observed
in a number of experiments [7–9]. Hence, in the pres-
ence of QPS the current ﬂow becomes dissipative and
– according, e.g., to the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem
(FDT) – one should also expect voltage ﬂuctuations to
occur in the system.

While these arguments suggest a positive answer to
the ﬁrst of the above questions they do not yet speciﬁ-
cally address shot noise. Two key pre-requisits of shot

noise are:
(i) the presence of discrete charge carriers
(e.g., electrons) in the system and (ii) scattering of such
carriers at disorder. Although discrete charge carriers –
Cooper pairs – are certainly present in superconducting
nanowires, they form a superconducting condensate ﬂow-
ing along the wire without any scattering. For this reason
the possibility for shot noise to occur in superconducting
nanowires appears by no means obvious.

In this Letter we will perform a detailed theoretical
analysis of QPS-induced voltage ﬂuctuations in ultrathin
superconducting wires.
In particular, we will demon-
strate that quantum tunneling of magnetic ﬂux quanta
Φ0 across the wire causes shot noise which obeys Poisson
statistics and shows a non-trivial dependence on temper-
ature, frequency and external current.

The model and eﬀective Hamiltonian. The system un-
der consideration is displayed in Fig. 1.
It consists of
an ultrathin superconducting wire of length L and cross
section s and a capacitance C switched in parallel to this
wire. The right end of the wire (x = L) is grounded as
shown in the ﬁgure (x is the coordinate along the wire
ranging from 0 to L). The voltage V (t) at its left end
x = 0 ﬂuctuates and such ﬂuctuations can be measured
by a detector. The whole system is biased by an external
current I = Vx/Rx.

An eﬀective Hamiltonian for our system can be written

in the form

ˆH = ˆHCh − Iϕ/2e + ˆHwire.

(1)

2

The ﬁrst and the second terms in the right-hand side of
Eq. (1) account respectively for the charging energy [10]

current I(x, t) and the local charge density ρ(x, t) are
deﬁned as

ˆHCh =

2C (cid:18)−i

∂

∂(ϕ/2e)

+ Q(cid:19)2

(2)

and for the potential energy tilt produced by an exter-
nal current I. The variable ϕ(t) ≡ ϕ(0, t) represents
the phase of the superconducting order parameter ﬁeld
∆(x, t) at x = 0. Here we also set ϕ(L, t) ≡ 0.
The last term ˆHwire in Eq. (1) describes the supercon-
ducting wire. This part of the eﬀective Hamiltonian can
be expressed in terms of both the modulus |∆(x, t)| and
the phase ϕ(x, t) of the order parameter ﬁeld [5, 6, 11].
Here, however, we will proceed diﬀerently and employ
the duality arguments.

The duality between the phase and the charge vari-
ables was established and discussed in details in the case
of ultrasmall Josephson junctions [10, 12–14]. Later the
same duality arguments were extended to short [15] and
long [16–18] superconducting wires. According to the
results [18] the dual representation for the Hamiltonian
of a superconducting nanowire is deﬁned by an eﬀective
sine-Gordon model

ˆHwire = ˆHT L + ˆHQP S.

(3)

In the absence of quantum phase slips such nanowire can
be described as a transmission line with

ˆHT L =Z L

where Lkin = 1/(πσN ∆0s) and Cw are respectively the
kinetic wire inductance (times length) and the geometric
wire capacitance (per length),

I(x, t) = ∂tχ(x, t)/Φ0,

ρ(x, t) = −∂xχ(x, t)/Φ0,

(8)

thereby satisfying the continuity equation. The charge Q
in Eq. (2) equals to Q(t) = χ(0, t)/Φ0.

Keldysh technique and perturbation theory. In order to
proceed we will make use of the Keldysh path integral
technique. Accordingly, our variables of interest need to
be deﬁned on the forward and backward time branches
of the Keldysh contour, i.e. we now have ϕF,B(t) and
χF,B(x, t). As usually, it is convenient to also introduce
the “classical” and “quantum” variables, respectively
ϕ+(t) = (ϕF (t) + ϕB(t))/2 and ϕ−(t) = ϕF (t) − ϕB(t)
(and similarly for the χ-ﬁelds). Making use of the Joseph-
son relation between the voltage and the phase one can
formally express the expectation value of the voltage op-
erator across the the superconducting wire in the form

hV (t1)i =

implies averaging with the Keldysh eﬀective action
S0 corresponding to the Hamiltonian ˆH0 = ˆH −
ˆHQP S. Analogously, for the voltage-voltage correlator
2h{ ˆV (t1), ˆV (t2)}i (where curly brackets
hV (t1)V (t2)i = 1
denote the anticommutator) one has

[Φ(x), χ(x′)] = −iΦ0δ(x − x′)

(5)

hV (t1)V (t2)i =

(12)

deﬁnes the commutation relation between the canonically
conjugate ﬂux (or phase) and charge operators, σN is the
normal state Drude conductance of the wire and ∆0 is
the superconducting gap. The term

ˆHQP S = −γQP SZ L

(6)

accounts for the eﬀect of quantum phase slips and

γQP S ∼ (gξ∆0/ξ) exp(−agξ),

a ∼ 1,

(7)

is the QPS tunneling amplitude [6] per unit wire length
with gξ = 2πσN s/(e2ξ) ≫ 1 being the dimensionless
normal state conductance of the wire segment of length
equal to the coherence length ξ.

The physical meaning of the quantum ﬁeld χ(x, t) is
transparent: It is proportional to the total charge q(x, t)
that has passed through the point x up to the time mo-
ment t, i.e. q(x, t) = χ(x, t)/Φ0. Accordingly, the local

Higher voltage correlators are deﬁned similarly. Their
analysis, however, is beyond the frames of this work.

Eqs. (9) and (12) are formally exact expressions which
we are now going to evaluate. To this end we will employ
the regular perturbation theory in γQP S (7) which can be
regarded as a small parameter of our theory. In the zero
order in γQP S the problem is described by the quadratic
(in both ϕ and χ) Hamiltonian ˆH0 and all averages can
be handled exactly with the aid of the Green functions

GR
ab(X, X ′) = −iha+(X)b−(X ′)i,
GK
ab(X, X ′) = −iha+(X)b+(X ′)i,

(13)

where a(X) and b(X) stand for one of the ﬁelds ϕ(t) and
χ(x, t). As both these ﬁelds are real, the advanced and
retarded Green functions obey the condition GA
ab(ω) =
ba(−ω). With this in mind the Keldysh function GK
GR
can be expressed in the form

(14)

Expanding Eqs. (9) and (12) up to the second order
in γQP S and performing all necessary averages we evalu-
ate the results in terms of the Green functions (13), see
Supplemental material for further details. The result of
our calculation both for the average voltage (9) and for
the voltage-voltage correlator (12) can also be expressed
in the form of “candy” diagrams displayed in Fig. 2.

Comparing the result (17) with that found in Ref. 5 we
immediately conclude that ΓQP S(I) deﬁnes the quantum
decay rate of the current state due to QPS. In [5] this
rate was evaluated from the imaginary part of the free
energy ΓQP S(I) = 2ImF . Here we derived the expression
for ΓQP S by means of the real time technique without
employing the ImF -method.

Making use of the above results, evaluating the Green
functions (13) (see Supplemental material) and keeping
in mind the detailed balance condition

brieﬂy re-derive the results [5] for the average voltage
within the framework of our technique. We obtain

τ0 ∼ 1/∆0 is the QPS core size in time and Γ(x) is
the Gamma-function. Here we also introduced the pa-
rameter [5] λ = Rq/2Zw ∝ √s, where Rq = π/2e2
Zw = pLkin/Cw is the wire impedance. It is satisfac-

tory to observe that the result (20), (21) matches with
that found in Ref. 5 by means of a diﬀerent technique
[20].

Let us now turn to voltage ﬂuctuations. Our pertur-
bative analysis allows to recover three diﬀerent contribu-

Eqs.
(22)-(26) together with the expressions for the
Green functions (see Supplemental material) fully deter-
mine the voltage noise power spectrum of a supercon-
ducting nanowire in the perturbative in QPS regime and
represent the central result of this work.

In the zero bias limit I → 0 the term Sa
Ω vanishes,
and the equilibrium noise spectrum SΩ = S(0)
Ω + Sr
Ω is
determined from FDT, see also [18]. At non-zero bias
values the QPS noise turns non-equilibrium. In the zero
frequency limit Ω → 0 the terms S(0)
Ω tend to
zero, and the voltage noise SΩ→0 ≡ S0 is determined
solely by Sa

Ω. Then from Eq. (26) we obtain

(27)

where hV i is speciﬁed in Eqs. (17), (20). Combining the
result (27) with Eqs. (20), (21) we ﬁnd

S0 ∝(T 2λ−2, T ≫ Φ0I,
T ≪ Φ0I.

I 2λ−2,

(28)

At higher temperatures T ≫ Φ0I (though still T ≪ ∆0)
Eq. (28) just describes equilibrium voltage noise S0 =
2T R of a linear Ohmic resistor R = hV i/I ∝ T 2λ−3 [5].
In the opposite low temperature limit T ≪ Φ0I it ac-
counts for QPS-induced shot noise S0 = Φ0hV i obeying
Poisson statistics with an eﬀective “charge” equal to the
ﬂux quantum Φ0.

This result sheds light on the physical origin of shot
noise in superconducting nanowires: It is produced by
coherent tunneling of magnetic ﬂux quanta Φ0 across
the wire. In the dual picture [18] such ﬂux quanta can
be viewed as charged quantum particles passing through
(and being scattered at) an eﬀective spatially extended
tunnel barrier.

Note that previously the result analogous to Eq. (27)
was derived for thermally activated phase slips (TAPS)
[21]. This similarity appears remarkable given a crucial
physical diﬀerence between TAPS and QPS: The former
can be regarded as classical (i.e.
incoherent) and non-
interacting objects, whereas the latter are fully coherent
[22] forming an interacting quantum gas.

4

Another interesting limiting case is that of suﬃciently
high frequencies and/or long wires v/L ≪ Ω ≪ ∆0. In
this limit we obtain

S(0)
Ω =

(Ω/2EC )2 + (λ/π)2 .

(29)

This contribution is independent of the wire length L. At
low T and Ω/λ & EC = e2/2C we have S(0)
Ω ∝ 1/Ω, i.e.
the wire may generate 1/f voltage noise. Evaluating the
QPS terms Sr
Ω we observe that the latter scales
linearly with the wire length L whereas the former does
not. Hence, the term Sr
Ω can be safely neglected in the
long wire limit. For the remaining QPS term Sa
Ω we get

(31)

This result can be interpreted as follows. At T = 0 each
QPS event excites (at least) two plasmons [23] (see Fig.
1) with total energy E = Φ0I propagating in the oppo-
site directions along the wire. One plasmon (with energy
E/2) gets dissipated at the grounded end of the wire
while another one (also with energy E/2) reaches its op-
posite end causing voltage ﬂuctuations (emits a photon)
with frequency Ω measured by a detector. Clearly, at
T = 0 this process is only possible at Ω < E/2 in the
agreement with Eq. (31).

FIG. 3: (Color online) The frequency dependence of the QPS
noise spectrum SΩ (30) at λ = 2.7, large EC and diﬀerent T
in the long wire limit. The inset shows SΩ as a function of T .

The result (30) is also illustrated in Fig. 3. At suﬃ-
ciently small Ω (we still keep Ω ≫ v/L) one observes a

5

non-monotonous dependence of SΩ on T which is a direct
consequence of quantum coherent nature of QPS noise.
Finally, we point out that the perturbative in γQP S
approach employed here is fully justiﬁed for not too thin
wires with λ > λc ≃ 2 [5]. In wires with λ < λc (char-
acterized by unbound QPS-anti-QPS pairs) γQP S gets
eﬀectively renormalized to higher values and, hence, the
perturbation theory eventually becomes obsolete. How-
ever, even in this case our results may still remain appli-
cable at suﬃciently high temperature, frequency and/or
current values. In the low energy limit long wires with
λ < λc show an insulating behavior, as follows from the
exact solution of the corresponding sine-Gordon model

[24]. This solution suggests that also voltage ﬂuctuations
become large in this limit.

In summary, we demonstrated that

quantum
phase slips generate voltage noise in superconduct-
ing nanowires.
In the presence of a current bias I
quantum tunneling of the magnetic ﬂux quanta Φ0
across the wire causes Poissonian shot noise with a
non-trivial power law dependence of its spectrum on
both I and frequency Ω. Our predictions can be directly
veriﬁed in future experiments and need to be observed
while optimizing the operation of QPS qubits [25].

The averages in Eqs. (S1) and (S2) are Gaussian and, hence, can be handled in a straightforward manner. After that
we immediately arrive at our ﬁnal results for the I − V curve (15), (16) and for the voltage noise spectrum (22)-(26).
Both these results are expressed via the function Px,x′(ω) (16) which in turn contains the Green function G(x, x′; t, 0).

B. Analytic structure of the Green functions

Let us deﬁne a more general Green function Gχ(x, x′; σ) which depends on the complex time σ and obeys the
condition Gχ(x, x′; t − i0) = G(x, x′; t, 0). With the aid of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition one can deduce that
the Green function Gχ is periodic in the imaginary time direction, i.e.

(S3)
This function is analytic and has branch cuts at Im(σ) = N/T for all integer N . The function exp(iGχ(x, x′; σ)) has
the same analytic properties. One can write

Gχ(x, x′; σ) = Gχ(x, x′; σ − i/T ).

Distorting the integration path and utilizing the property Gχ(x, x′; σ) = − ¯Gχ(x, x′;−σ) together with Eq. (S3) we
arrive at the detailed balance condition (19).

The last two expressions take a much simpler form in the long wire limit, in which case all plasmon excitations moving
towards the grounded end of the wire eventually disappear and never pop up again while excitations moving in the
opposite direction produce voltage ﬂuctuations measured by a detector. In this limit Eqs. (S6) and (S7) reduce to
