A short and simple proof of the Jurkat–Waterman

theorem on conjugate functions

V. V. Lebedev

Abstract. It is well–known that certain properties of continuous
functions on the circle T, related to the Fourier expansion, can be
improved by a change of variable, i.e., by a homeomorphism of the
circle onto itself. One of the results in this area is the Jurkat–Waterman
theorem on conjugate functions, which improves the classical Bohr–
P´al theorem. In the present work we provide a short and technically
very simple proof of the Jurkat–Waterman theorem. Our approach
yields a stronger result.

It is well–known that certain properties of continuous functions f on the

circle T = R/2πZ, related to their Fourier expansions

f (t) ∼Xk∈Z bf (k)eikt,

can be improved by a change of variable, i.e., by a homeomorphism of
the circle onto itself. The ﬁrst result in this area is the classical Bohr–P´al
theorem [1], [2], which states that for every real-valued continuous function
f on T there exists a homeomorphism h of T onto itself such that the
superposition f ◦ h belongs to the space U(T) of functions with uniformly
convergent Fourier series. 1

W. Jurkat and D. Waterman [5] (see also [6, Theorem 9.5]) obtained the

following improvement of the Bohr–P´al theorem.

1This theorem was obtained by J. P´al in a somewhat weaker form, the ﬁnal version is
due to H. Bohr. The proof was subsequently simpliﬁed by R. Salem in [3], his proof can
also be found in [4, Ch. IV, Sec. 12].

Theorem. Let f be a real-valued continuous function on the circle T.
Then there exists a homeomorphism h of T onto itself such that the function
]f ◦ h conjugate to the superposition f ◦ h is continuous and is of bounded
variation on T.

We recall that for a function g ∈ L1(T) the conjugate function eg is

functions analytic in the disk D = {z ∈ C : |z| < 1} of the complex
plane C. Let F be a function of the Hardy class H 2(D), then, setting

(the ﬁnite limit exists for almost all t ∈ T). If g ∈ L2(T), then eg ∈ L2(T),
and the Fourier coeﬃcients of the functions g,eg are related by beg(k) =
−i(sgn k)bg(k) (here sgn k = k/|k| for k 6= 0 and sgn 0 = 0). Consider
u(t) = Re F (eit), v(t) = Im F (eit), we have eu = v − Im F (0).
eg are continuous and one of them is in U(T), then the other one is in U(T)

It is well-known that every continuous function of bounded variation is
in U(T). It is also known (see, e.g., [4, Ch. VIII, Sec. 19]) that if both g and

as well; thus, the Jurkat–Waterman theorem implies the Bohr–P´al theorem,
moreover we obtain f ◦ h ∈ U(T), ]f ◦ h ∈ U(T).

In the present paper we give an alternative proof of the Jurkat–Waterman
theorem. Our proof is based on general facts and, being void of technical
details, is extremely short and simple. Similarly to the original proof of
the Bohr–P´al theorem, and similarly to the original proof of the Jurkat–
Waterman theorem, our proof also involves a conformal mapping of the
disk D onto a certain domain in C. A simpliﬁcation of the proof is achieved
due to a special choice of the domain, which is diﬀerent from the one used
in the original works. In addition, combining our method with a result of
the work [7], we obtain a stronger assertion, see Remark 1 after the end of
the proof of the theorem.

Proof of the Theorem. Consider a curve γ ⊆ C given by γ(t) =
ef (t)+it, t ∈ [0, 2π]. This is a closed curve without self-intersections. Let V
be the inner domain of this curve. We have 0 ∈ V . Consider a conformal
mapping G of the disk D onto V . We can assume that G(0) = 0. As is known
the mapping G extends to a homeomorphism of the closure D of D onto
the closure V of V and, being thus extended, homeomorphically maps the

2

boundary ∂D of D onto the boundary γ of V . Preserving our notation we
denote this extension by G. It is clear that there exists a homeomorphism
h of the segment [0, 2π] onto itself such that G(eit) = γ(h(t)). Thus,

G(eit) = ef ◦h(t)+ih(t),

t ∈ [0, 2π].

(1)

Since G(0) = 0, we have G(z) = zξ(z), z ∈ D, where ξ is a function
analytic in D. It is clear that ξ extends to a function continuous in D.
Preserving our notation we denote this extension by ξ. Note now that if z ∈
D \ {0}, then ξ(z) 6= 0, for otherwise we would have a point z0 ∈ D, z0 6= 0,
such that G(z0) = 0, which is impossible since G(0) = 0 and G is one-to-
one. At the origin we have ξ(0) = G′(0) 6= 0, since G is conformal. Thus,
the function ξ is analytic in D, continuous in D, and non-vanishing in D.
It follows that ξ is of the form ξ(z) = eη(z), z ∈ D, where η is a function
analytic in D and continuous in D. Indeed, one can take η to be any ﬁxed
continuous branch of log ξ(z), z ∈ D. Since ξ is continuous in D and does
not vanish in D, the function η so deﬁned is continuous in D as well. 2

Taking (1) into account, we have

eη(eit) = ξ(eit) = e−itG(eit) = e−it+f ◦h(t)+ih(t).

Hence,

η(eit) = −it + f ◦ h(t) + ih(t) + i2πN(t),

(2)

where N(t) takes integer values for all t. Since the function η(eit) is continuous,
the function N(t) is continuous as well and hence it is identically constant,
N(t) = N0 for all t ∈ [0, 2π]. Thus, from (2) it follows that

η(eit) = f ◦ h(t) + i(h(t) − t + 2πN0),

t ∈ [0, 2π].

Hence,

]f ◦ h(t) = h(t) − t + 2πN0 − Im η(0).

t ∈ [0, 2π].

(3)

Identifying h on the left-hand side of (3) with a homeomorphism of T we
complete the proof. (cid:3)

Remarks. 1. The above method of proof of the Jurkat–Waterman theorem

yields a stronger result, namely: for every real-valued continuous function

2For another proof of the existence of the representation ξ = eη, based on the theory

of commutative Banach algebras, see [8, Theorem 2.11].

f on T there exists a homeomorphism h of T onto itself such that ]f ◦ h
is of bounded variation and has the logarithmic modulus of continuity. In
addition, the homeomorphism h has the logarithmic modulus of continuity.
As usual, saying that a function g has the logarithmic modulus of continuity
we mean that

Let us verify that the stated improvement holds. The domain V , that we
considered in the proof of the theorem, is star-like with respect to 0, i.e., for
every point z ∈ V the line segment [0, z] lies in V . Taking relations (1), (3)
into account it remains to use the following result by N. S. Stylianopoulos
and E. Wegert [7]: let V ⊆ C be the inner domain of a Jordan curve, and
let G be a conformal mapping of the disk D onto V with G(0) = 0, then
assuming V is star-like with respect to 0, the function

ϕ(t) = arg G(eit),

t ∈ [0, 2π],

has the logarithmic modulus of continuity.

2. As is noted by Jurkat and Waterman [5] their theorem implies that for
every real-valued continuous function f on T there exists a homeomorphism
h such that the Fourier coeﬃcients of the superposition f ◦ h are rapidly
decreasing, namely [f ◦ h(k) = O(1/|k|). This is a direct consequence of a
well-known estimate for the Fourier coeﬃcients of a function of bounded

Passing to the limit as N → ∞, and taking into account that σN (g)(t)
converge uniformly to g(t), we obtain g ∈ W 1/2
(T).3 Note by the way that
for every continuous function that belongs to W 1/2
(T), we have g ∈ U(T).
4. The Bohr–P´al theorem was extended to families of functions by J. -P.
Kahane and Y. Katznelson. These authors showed [9] (see also [10]) that
if K is a compact family in the space C(T) of continuous functions on T,
then there exists a homeomorphism h such that f ◦ h ∈ U(T) for all f ∈ K.
In particular the assertion of the Bohr–P´al theorem holds for a complex-
valued f . On the other hand it is impossible to get a similar extension of the
Jurkat–Waterman theorem. Moreover there exist two real-valued continuous
functions u and v such that there is no homeomorphism h of T onto itself
with the property that both inclusions u◦h ∈ W 1/2
(T) hold
simultaneously. This was ﬁrst established in [11, Theorem 4]. Thus, there
exists a complex-valued continuous function f such that f ◦ h /∈ W 1/2
(T),
for every homeomorphism h (see also [12] where it is shown that for each
α < 1/2 such an f can be chosen so that it satisﬁes the Lipschitz condition
of order α).

5. Another improvement of the Bohr–P´al theorem is due to A. A. Sahakian
[13]. He showed that if {ε(n), n = 1, 2, . . .} is a positive sequence monotonically

n=1 ε(n)/n = ∞, then for every real-valued

g ∈ U(T); thus Sahakian’s result implies the Bohr–P´al theorem.

1/|k|3/2). It is well-known that if g is continuous and bg(k) = o(1/|k|), then
Pk∈Z |[f ◦ h(k)| < ∞. There exists a real-valued continuous function f such

that whenever h is a homeomorphism, the superposition f ◦h does not belong
to the space A(T) of absolutely convergent Fourier series. This result, that
provides a solution to Lusin’s rearrangement problem, is obtained by A. M.
Olevskiˇı [14] (see also [10]).

At the same time, in general, it is impossible to attain the condition

6. The Sahakian theorem, which guarantees a very fast decrease of the
Fourier coeﬃcients of the superposition f ◦ h, shows in particular, that for

an appropriate homeomorphism we have f ◦ h(k) = O(1/|k|) and f ◦ h ∈
W 1/2
(T). At the same time, the Sahakian theorem does not imply even the
continuity of ]f ◦ h. It is easy to verify that whenever {ε(n), n = 1, 2, . . .} is
a sequence satisfying the assumptions of the Sahakian theorem, one can ﬁnd
