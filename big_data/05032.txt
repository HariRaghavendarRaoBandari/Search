CONCENTRATION RESULTS FOR DIRECTED POLYMER WITH

UNBOUNDED JUMPS

SHUTA NAKAJIMA

Abstract. We study the free energy and its relevant quantity for the directed polymer in
random environment. The polymer is allowed to make unbounded jumps and the environment is
given by the Bernoulli variables. We ﬁrst establish the concentration of the ground state energy
of polymer at zero temperature. Secondly, we also prove the same property of the free energy at
ﬁnite temperature. In the proof, we use the fact that the maximum jump of any polymer nearly
minimizing energy is not too large with high probability. This is an interesting property itself
from the ﬁrst passage percolation viewpoint.

1. Introduction

We discuss models of directed polymer which have unbounded jumps introduced in [2]. See [2]
for the background and related works. The previous paper shows the following three results: (i) The
continuity of the free energy with respect to inverse temperature and the appearance probability of
obstacles; (ii) The asymptotic of the free energy as the appearance probability of obstacles goes to
1; (iii) The continuity of the time constant of First Passage Percolation (FPP) related to the model.
In this paper, we show concentration bounds for the ground state energy, which is nothing but the
passage time, and the free energy. As applications, we derive the so-called “rate of convergence”
results and, based on them, we are able to remove the restriction left in [2] on a parameter in (i)
and also give an alternative proof of (iii).

In fact, a concentration bound for the lower tail for FPP is shown in [2], Proposition 3.1.
However the upper tail is signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult as we need to control the maximum jump of
the optimal path, see Section 2.2 below. In this paper, we succeed in controlling jumps not only
of the optimal path but also of low energy paths in the directed polymer model. As a result, we
can show the concentration for the passage time and the free energy.

1.1. Setting of models.

Let ({Xn}n∈N, P ) be the random walk on Zd starting from 0 and with the transition probability

P (Xn+1 = z|Xn = y) = f (|y − z|1),

where |x|1 :=(cid:80)d
where α, c2 > 0 and c1 is a positive constant determined as to be (cid:80)

i=1 |xi| for x ∈ Zd and f : N ∪ {0} → R is a function of the form

y∈Zd f (|y|1) = 1 (for the
choice of f (k), see Remark 3 below). The random environment is modelled by independent and
identically distributed Bernoulli random variables ({η(j, x)}(j,x)∈N×Zd , Q) with parameter p;

(1.1)

f (k) = c1 exp{−c2kα},

We introduce the Hamiltonian

whose existence can be shown by using subadditive ergodic theorem. In [2], the continuity property
and some asymptotic beahvior of the free energy were studied.

Next, we introduce First Passage Percolation models related to this directed polymer. Denote

the (scaled) points where η = 0 by

(cid:88)

ωp =

(1 − η(k, x))δ(k,spx),

(cid:41)

(cid:40) n(cid:88)

(k,x)∈N×Zd
p )1/d ∼ (1 − p)1/d (p ↑ 1). This scaling is natural since ωp
with the scaling factor sp = (log 1
converges as p ↑ 1 to the Poisson point process ω1 on N × Rd whose intensity is the product of the
counting measure and Lebesgue measure. With some abuse of notation we will frequently identify
ωp, and more generally any point measure, with its support. Given a realization of ωp, we deﬁne
the minimum passage time from 0 to n by

(1.3)

Tn(ωp) = min

|xk−1 − xk|α : x0 = 0 and {(k, xk)}n

k=1 ⊂ ωp

.

This is the directed version of the Howard-Newman’s Euclidean FPP model in [3]. Now, a direct
application of the subadditive ergodic theorem shows that the limit

k=1

(1.4)

µp = lim
n→∞

n

Tn(ωp)

exists Q-almost surely and equals to lim 1
n Q[Tn(ωp)]. The limit µp, so-called time constant, is non
random. Observe also that deﬁnition (1.3) makes perfect sense when p = 1, yielding a limit µ1 in
(1.4). It is again shown in [2] that µp is continuous as p (cid:37) 1.
This FPP is related to the ground state at β = −∞ of the directed polymer introduced above.

Namely,

sup{P (Xi = xi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) : xi ∈ Zd, η(i, xi) = 0} = cn

1 exp{−c2s−α

p Tn(ωp)}.

Furthermore, it is shown in [2] that as p ↑ 1, the ground state gives dominant contribution to the
free energy:

(1.5)

ϕ(p,−∞) ∼ −c2µ1(1 − p)−α/d.

Remark 1. As one sees above, the subadditive ergodic theorm is useful to show the existence of
the free energy and the time constant. However, it prevent us from getting more information about
them, such as the continuity. In this paper, we will use a method of concentration of measures to
get the rate of convergence in (1.2) and (1.4) and derive the continuity results as a corollary.

1.2. Main results.

First, we shall present the results for FPP. The ﬁrst result is the concentration of the passage

time around the mean.
Theorem 1. For any δ > 0 there exist positive constants C1,C2 > 0, and λ ∈ (0, 1] which are
independent of p and n such that for any n ∈ N,
(1.6)

Q(|Tn(ωp) − Q[Tn(ωp)]| > n

2 +δ) < C1 exp{−C2nλ}.

The next result is about the rate of convergence. It implies that the ﬂuctuation exponent (see

[4]) is 1

2 or less.

Theorem 2. For any χ > 1/2 there exist positive constants C0 > 0 which are independent of p
such that for any n ∈ N,

(1.7)

|nµp − Q[Tn(ωp)]| < C0nχ,

Combining (1.6) and (1.7), we have, for any χ > 1/2 there exist positive constants C0, C1, C2, λ >

0 which are independent of p such that for any n ∈ N,

(1.8)
Corollary 1. µp is continuous in p ∈ [0, 1].

Q[|Tn(ωp) − nµp| > 2C0nχ) < C1 exp{−C2nλ}.

Corollary 1 is a slight extension of Theorem 1.5 in [2] where the continuity is proved only at

p = 1. This follows from Theorem 2 and the continuity of the mean of the passage time in p.

Next, we move on to the results for directed polymer model. We have the following same

properties as in FPP.
Theorem 3. In the above setting, for any q ∈ [0, 1), δ > 0 and β0 ∈ R, there exist C1, C2 > 0,
and λ ∈ (0, 1) for any p ∈ [0, q), β ∈ [−∞, β0], and n ∈ N,

Q(| log Z η,β

n ]| < C0nχ,

Q[| log Z η,β

Next theorem is an extension of Theorem 1.2 in [2] where the continuity is proved only for α < d.

Corollary 2. ϕ(p, β) is jointly continuous on [0, 1) × [−∞,∞).

Remark 2. Corollary 1 can in fact be proved by the “coupling method” in [2]. Nevertheless,
we think the line of the argument—proving the continuity of a limiting quantity like the time
constant via a concentration bound—is of interest. In Corollary 2, the method of concentration
indeed yields a better result than the rather bare-handed approach in [2].
Remark 3. These results still hold even if the deﬁnition of f (k) is replaced by c exp{−V (k)}
where V holds either 0 < C1 < V (cid:48)(cid:48)(x) < C2 for any x with some positive constant C1 and C2 or
that V (cid:48) is regularly varying with index β > 0. Indeed, the key lemma below can be shown by the
essentially the same way for these choices.

1.3. Organization of the paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the proofs of Theorems 1
and 3. As for FPP, we divide the proof into two parts; α ≤ 1 or α > 1. We ﬁrst prove the case
α ≤ 1 which is relatively easy. To prove the other case, we need key lemma in Section 2.2. This
lemma is the essential part of this paper. In Section 3, we prove Theorems 2 and 4. Finally, we
prove Corollaries 1 and 2 in Section 4.

2. Proof of the concentration around the mean

Q-almost surely. Then (1) follows by a concentration inequality for martingales, for example,
Theorem 1.1 in [5]. Let us introduce some notation. Given two conﬁgurations ω and ω(cid:48) and
m ∈ N, we deﬁne a new conﬁguration by

(2.4)

[ω, ω(cid:48)]m = ω|[0,m]×Rd + ω(cid:48)|[m+1,∞)×Rd .

Let π(m)
be a minimizing path for this conﬁguration chosen by a deterministic algorithm (if not
unique). For a time-space point (k, x) ∈ N×Rd, we deﬁne (k, x)∗ω to be a point in ω|{k}×Rd closest
to (k, x).

Now we rewrite the martingale diﬀerence as

(cid:90)

(2.5)

∆m =

Q(dω(cid:48))(Tn([ω, ω(cid:48)]m) − Tn([ω, ω(cid:48)]m−1)).

2.2. Key lemma (The uniform bound for jumps).

As we mentioned before, it is more diﬃcult to prove Theorem 1 in α > 1 case. Indeed, we need
to estimate the change of minimum passage time when we replace the conﬁguration on a section
by another one, but we do not have the triangular inequality (2.7). A natural alternative way is
to use Taylor’s theorem to get

Tn([ω, ω(cid:48)]m) − Tn([ω, ω(cid:48)]m−1) ≥ − C(|π(m)

with some positive constant C. Then, the jump size of the optimal path appears in this change
and we need to show that it is not too large. Such a geometric property of the optimal path is
usually hard to establish but we can show that it has no jumps of polynomial size in n. We shall
state it in a slightly generalized way that is useful in the study of the directed polymer model.

For any n-path γ ∈ (Rd){1,··· ,n}, we write γ(k) := the kth point of γ, and ∆γ(k) := |γ(k) −
γ(k − 1)|1, where we put γ(0) = 0 for the convention. Given a conﬁgration ω and n-path γ, we
write γ ⊂ ω if (i, γ(i)) ∈ ω for any i = 1,··· , n. We say ω ⊂ N × Rd has θ-property if
(2.10)

ω ∩ (i, x + [0, nθ)d) (cid:54)= ∅ for any i ∈ N, x ∈ Zd.

Intuitively, θ-property means conﬁgration has no big vacant regions. As we shall see in Lemma

2, the assumption of θ-property have a little inﬂuence on the minimum passage time.
Deﬁnition 1. For any n-path γ ∈ R{1,··· ,n}, Tn(γ) is deﬁned by

n(cid:88)

Tn(γ) =

∆γ(i)α.

The next lemma is the key of all results in this paper. Roughly speaking, for any polymer,

i=1

either it has no big jumps or we can ﬁnd another polymer with a smaller passage time.
Lemma 1. Suppose α > 1. For any ζ > 0, there exist θ > 0 and N = N (θ) ∈ N such that for any
n > N (θ), s ∈ {1,··· , n}, an n-path γ and a conﬁguration ω(cid:48) which has θ-Property, either of the
following holds;

(i) max{∆γ(s), ∆γ(s + 1)} ≤ nζ,
(ii) There exists an n-path γ(cid:48) and k > 0 such that γ(i) = γ(cid:48)(i) for any i /∈ [s, s + k − 1],

(i, γ(cid:48)(i)) ∈ ω(cid:48) for i ∈ [s, s + k − 1] and

Tn(γ(cid:48)) + (k + 1)nθ ≤ Tn(γ).

k ⊂ ¯ω close to this straight line. Due to the convexitity of |·|α

The proof of Lemma 1 is not long but a bit complicated. Let us explain the idea of the proof in
the case that γ is the minimizing path for ω(cid:48). Let A0 be the point where next jump is larger than
nζ and introduce a sequence of large numbers satisfying nζ (cid:29) L1 (cid:29) L2 (cid:29) ··· .
We draw cones Ck with slope Lk starting at A0 and let Ak be the ﬁrst point where the optimal
path γ touches it. Then we draw a straight line between A0 and Ak. Thanks to the θ-property, we
can ﬁnd a path γ(cid:48)
1 , average jumps are
better (See Figure 1 above). This yields that, if we forget about the restriction ⊂ ¯ω, the straight
line connecting A0 and Ak is the optimal path when α > 1. On the other hand, by deﬁnition, γ
has a smaller passage time than γ(cid:48)
k does. Then it is natural to expect that most of the jumps of γ
between A0 and Ak are close to Lk in size. But in the ﬁrst A0 → Ak−1 segment, most of the jumps
are close to Lk−1 for the same reason and hence far from Lk. This implies that the duration of
A0 → Ak is much longer than that of A0 → Ak−1. Based on this observation, we can prove that
Ak goes beyond the n-th section before Lk becomes small. But this implies that the optimal path
γ stays outside a cone of very large angle until n. This is very unlikely because optimal path has
too much passage time between A0 and n-th section and one can indeed derive a contradiction.
Proof. Let m ∈ N such that m > 5/ζ, and we take θ > 0 suﬃciently small and N = N (θ) ∈ N
such that suﬃciently large. (For example, if θ > 0 and N such that

25mαθ < ζ and N min{α−1,1}θ > 2α+4α2(α − 1)−1 + (2

α − 1)−1),

Left: Passage time of AB2C is smaller than that of AB1C when α > 1.
Right: Drawing cones, we investigate γ between A0 and Ak inductively.

Figure 1

one can see that the following proof works.) Suppose that neither (i) nor (ii) holds and we shall
derive a contradiction. This means we suppose the following two conditions;

(i’) max{∆γ(s), ∆γ(s + 1)} > nζ,
(ii’) For any an n-path γ(cid:48) and k > 0 such that γ(i) = γ(cid:48)(i) for i /∈ [s, s + k], and (i, γ(cid:48)(i)) ∈ ω(cid:48)

for i ∈ [s, s + k], Tn(γ(cid:48)) + (k + 1)nθ > Tn(γ).

Due to (i’), either ∆γ(s) > nζ or ∆γ(s + 1) > nζ. Let τ be such that nτ = ∆γ(s). Then, taking
− γ(cid:48)(s)|1 ≤ dnθ,

a path γ(cid:48) such that γ(cid:48)(i) = γ(i) for any i (cid:54)= s, (s, γ(cid:48)(s)) ∈ ω(cid:48) and | γ(s−1)+γ(s+1)

If 2τ < ζ, this is further bounded from below by 2nθ, which contradicts (ii’). Hence we have 2τ ≥ ζ.

(2.11)
By the θ-property of ω(cid:48), there exists a path γ(cid:48) such that γ(i) = γ(cid:48)(i) for any i ≤ s − 1 and
(i, γ(i)) ∈ ω(cid:48), ∆γ(i) ≤ 2dnθ for any i ≥ s. If the range of inﬁmum of (2.11) is empty, then
(2.12)
and (ii) follows. Hence, we can suppose the range is not void for k ≤ m.

Let ¯γk be a straight line drawn between (s − 1, γ(s − 1)) and ((cid:96)k, γ((cid:96)k)). We write a slope

2.3. Concentration for FPP with α > 1.

In this subsection, we prove Theorem 1 for α > 1. We ﬁx a small θ > 0 and deﬁne

(2.17)

¯ω = ω +

(cid:88)

(k,x)∈N×nθZd

that is, when we ﬁnd a large vacant box, we add an ω-point artiﬁcially at a corner. We ﬁrst recall
Lemma 3.3 in [2] which shows that Tn(ωp) and Tn(¯ωp) are essentially the same.
Lemma 2. There exists C4 > 0 such that for suﬃciently large n ∈ N,
max{Q(Tn(ωp) (cid:54)= Tn(¯ωp)), Q[|Tn(ωp) − Tn(¯ωp)|]}

(2.18)

≤ exp{−C4ndθ}.

Proof. This is proved only for ω1 in [2] but the same proof works for general ωp.

(cid:3)

Proof of (1.6) for α > 1. Fix δ > 0. Let us denote by ¯ω(m)
the point process obtained by replacing
its {m}×Rd-section by another conﬁguration ¯ω(cid:48). We are going to use the so-called entropy method
and it requires a bound on

Let πn be a minimizing path for ¯ωp. Note that this depends implicitly on θ through (2.17).

Lemma 3. Suppose α > 1. For any ζ > 0, there exists θ ∈ (0, ζ) and
N = N (θ) ∈ N such that for any n > N and 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
∆πn(i) ≤ nζ.

Proof. Let ω(cid:48) = ¯ωp γ = πn in Lemma 1. Then for any s ∈ {1,··· , n}, either (i) or (ii) holds. If (ii)
holds, it contradicts that πn is a minimizing path. It follows that (i) holds and we get the desired
(cid:3)
conclusion.

By using Lemma 3, we can bound the summands of (2.19) from above by no(1) and consequently

(2.19) itself by n1+o(1) a.s.

If we take ζ suﬃciently small, (2.19) is less than Cn1+δ. Then, Theorem 6.7 in [1] yields

which implies (1.6).

(cid:3)

Combined the proof of (1.6) with Borel-Cantelli Lemma, we also have the following corollary.

Corollary 3. For any ζ > 0, as N → ∞,

Q(For any n ≥ N and optimal path πn for Tn(ωp) and i ∈ {1,··· , n}, ∆πn(i) ≤ nζ) → 1.

2.4. Concentration of the free energy.
In this subsection, we prove Theorem 3. By the relation

(2.24)
we have only to consider the case β ∈ [−∞, 0]. To simplify the notation, we write Zn(ω) instead
of Z β,η

e−Fn(γ;ω).

First, we bound the diﬀerence of partition functions Zn(ω) and Zn(¯ω). We begin with the following
tail bounds.
Lemma 5.

(i) There exists C0 > 0 independent of p ∈ (0, 1] such that for all n ∈ N and m > C0n,

(2.25)

Q(Tn(ωp) > m) ≤ exp{−m1∧ d

(ii) There exists C1 > 0 and N ∈ N such that for all n > N ,

Zn(ω) − ˜Zn(ω) ≤ e−C1n1+2αθ

Proof. (i) See Lemma 3.2 in [2]. Although ωp is replaced by ω1 in [2], the proof is essentially the
same.

Lemma 6. For any q ∈ [0, 1) and θ > 0, there exists λ, C1 > 0 and N ∈ N such that for any
n > N and p ∈ [0, q),

(i) Q(| log Zn(ω) − log Zn(¯ω)| > log 2) ≤ e−C1nλ
(ii) 0 ≤ Q[log Zn(¯ω)] − Q[log Zn(ω)] ≤ 1.

Proof. Since Zn(ω) ≥ cn

Thus to prove (i),

it suﬃces to show Zn(¯ω) < 2Zn(ω) under the two conditions: Zn(ω) ≥

that if γ exits [−nM +2θ, nM +2θ]d × [0, n], then Tn(γ) > n1+2αθ as it must contain a jump larger
than n 1

where in the last line we have used (2.27), (2.28) and the Schwarz inequality to bound the second
(cid:3)
term.
From Lemma 6, if we show the concentration for ¯ω, that is, for any δ > 0 there exists λ ∈ (0, 1)

and C0, C1 > 0 such that

(2.29)

2 +δ) ≤ C0e−C1nλ

,

we can also see the concentratioin for ω. We will use the entropy method as in the FPP case and
the following two lemmas correspond to Lemma 3 and 4.
Lemma 7. Let s ∈ {1,··· , n}. We take conﬁgurations ω, ω(cid:48) such that ω|{(cid:96)}×Rd = ω(cid:48)|{(cid:96)}×Rd for
any (cid:96) (cid:54)= s. Then, for any path γ, there exists γ(cid:48) such that either;

(i) for any i (cid:54)= s, γ(i) = γ(cid:48)(i), and Fn(γ(cid:48); ¯ω(cid:48)) ≤ c2n(α−1)ζ+3θ + Fn(γ; ¯ω) or
(ii) there exists k > 0 such that for any i /∈ [s, s + k], γ(i) = γ(cid:48)(i), and

Fn(γ(cid:48); ¯ω(cid:48)) + c2(k + 1)nθ ≤ Fn(γ; ¯ω),

where the constant c2 comes from (1.1).
Proof. When α ≤ 1, it is easy to prove that (i) holds for any γ. Suppose α > 1 and we apply the
Lamma 1 with ω(cid:48) = ¯ω(cid:48). It suﬃces to show that (i) and (ii) in Lemma 1 lead to (i) and (ii) in
Lemma 7, respectively. As for (i), we ﬁrst construct a polymer γ(cid:48) such that γ(cid:48)(i) = γ(i) for i (cid:54)= s,
(s, γ(cid:48)(s)) ∈ ¯ω(cid:48)|{m}×Rd , and |γ(cid:48)(s)− γ(s)|1 ≤ dnθ. Then, it is easy to check that this γ(cid:48) satisﬁes the
condition (i) in this lemma. On the other hand, we can easily check the claim for (ii) because of
the assumption of β ∈ [−∞, 0], which is declared at the beginning of this subsection.
(cid:3)
Lemma 8. Let ω and ω(cid:48) be as in Lemma 7. For any δ > 0, there exist θ > 0 and C > 0 such that
for any n ∈ N,

| log Zn(¯ω) − log Zn(¯ω(cid:48))| ≤ Cnδ.

Proof. Note ﬁrst that for any ω,

˜Zn(¯ω) ≥ cn

1 e−c2Tn(¯ω) ≥ cn

1 e−c2dαn1+αθ

since ¯ω has θ-property. This together with Lemma 5-(ii) allows us to replace Zn by ˜Zn in the
claim. For a path γ(cid:48) and k ∈ N, we deﬁne the following sets;

Φ1(γ(cid:48)) := {γ : Tn(γ) ≤ c2n1+2αθ, (γ, γ(cid:48)) satisﬁes the condition (i)}
Φ2,k(γ(cid:48)) := {γ : Tn(γ) ≤ c2n1+2αθ, (γ, γ(cid:48)) satisﬁes the condition (ii) with k},

low (2.26)), this is further bounded from above by

With the symmetry between ω and ω(cid:48), this implies

| log Zn(¯ω) − log Zn(¯ω(cid:48))| ≤ log {2e2c2n(α−1)ζ+3θ}

≤ 3c2n(α−1)ζ+3θ.

If we take ζ > 0 suﬃciently small so that 3c2n(α−1)ζ+3θ < nδ, the proof is completed.

Thanks to Lemma 8, we can use Theorem 6.7 in [1] and we get the desired concentration (2.29)

of log Zn(¯ω).

3.1. FPP Case.

3. Non-random fluctuation

In this subsection, we deduce the so-called non-random ﬂuctuation bound (1.7) from the con-
centration bound (1.6). This is a well-studied subject in the theory of ﬁrst passage percolation
and we shall adapt the argument of Zhang in [6] to our setting.
Proof of (1.7). Let χ > 1/2, M = 1 + α−1 and πn = π(n)
We deﬁne a face to face passage time

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is a direct consequence of Lemma 2. Translation invariance implies that
the probabilities

Q(There exists a minimizing path for Φn(0, n; ωp)

(3.4)
for y ∈ Zd ∩ (−nM , nM )d are the same as Q(A2(n)). Since the union of the above events has
(cid:3)
probability one and the number of possible y’s are less than (2nM )d, we are done.

starting at (0, x) with |x − y|∞ ≤ 1/2)

With this lemma and (1.6), we can complete the proof of (1.7). Note ﬁrst that on the event
A1(n), we have π2n(n) ∈ (−nM , nM )d as the displacement of π2n until time n is at most 2n · nθ ∨
(2n)θ+α−1
(3.5)

T2n(ωp) ≥ Tn(ωp) + Φn(n, 2n; ωp)

< nM for any suﬃciently small θ. As a result

since the second half of π2n is candidates of the face to face minimizing paths. On the other hand,
from Lemma 3, for any ζ > 0, if we take θ > 0 suﬃciently small,

(3.6)

with some C > 0 on A = (cid:84)

Φn(n, 2n; ωp) ≥ T (n, 2n; ωp) − 2dα ∨ Cn(α−1)ζ+θ

1≤i≤2 Ai(n) since only possible diﬀerences come from the starting
points, which can be controlled by using the mean value theorem. Therefore on A, for χ > 1/2
and suﬃciently large n ∈ N, we have the following almost super-additivity:
(3.7)

T2n(ωp) ≥ Tn(ωp) + T (n, 2n; ωp) − nχ.

Now we use (1.6) to obtain

(3.8)

Q (|Tn(ωp) − Q[Tn(ωp)]| > nχ) ≤ C1 exp(cid:8)−C2nλ(cid:9)

and the same bound for T2n(ωp) and T2n(ωp). These bounds and Lemma 9 show that for all
suﬃciently large n,
A ∩

{|T (k, l; ωp) − Q[T (k, l; ωp)]| ≤ nχ}

(3.9)

(cid:92)

(k,l)∈{(0,2n),(0,n),(n,2n)}

has positive probability and in particular non-empty. Hence we can replace the passage times
in (3.7) by their expectation at the cost of extra −3nχ on the right-hand side to obtain

(3.10)

Iterating this, we arrive at

and letting k → ∞, Q[Tn(ωp)] ≤ nµp + Cnχ follows. On the other hand, since it is easy to check
(cid:3)
the usual subadditivity, we have (1.7). From (1.6) and (1.7), we have (1.8).

3.2. Free energy Case.

The proof is almost the same as that for FPP, so we only mention the outline here. To prove

Theorem 2, we again use the argument of Zhang. Let

From the concentration (1.9) and this, for any χ > 1/2, there exist constant C > 0 independent of
n such that,

Q[log Z2n] ≤ 2Q[log Zn] + Cnχ
In a similar way to the proof of Theorem 2, we have for any k,

Q[log Z2kn]

log Z2n ≥ log ˜Zn + log Z(n, 2n, 0, ω) ≥ log 2 + log Zn + log Z(n, 2n, 0, ω),

which implies

ϕ(p, β) ≥ 1
n

Q[log Zn] − C(cid:48)nχ−1.

This implies (1.10). From (1.10) and (1.9), it is immediate to prove (1.11).

4. Proof of continuity results

Thanks to the non-random ﬂuctuation results, it suﬃces to show the continuity of Q[Tn] and

Q[log Zn] for ﬁxed n ∈ N.
Lemma 10. For any n ∈ N ﬁxed, Q[Tn(ωp)] is continuous function of p ∈ [0, 1].
Proof. Note that Tn(·) is continuous on the set of locally ﬁnite point conﬁgurations with respect
to the vague topology. Indeed for any ω, the deﬁnition of passage time tells us that only points
inside a compact set matter. By local ﬁniteness we can choose the compact set in such a way that
its boundary contains no points of ω. Now if ωN → ω vaguely as N → ∞, then the points of ωN
inside the compact set converge to those of ω in the Hausdorﬀ metric and then it easily follows that

Tn(ωN ) → Tn(ω). By using the Skorohod representation theorem, we may assume that Q-almost

surely, ωp → ω(cid:48)
From this, Tn(ωp) is continuous in p ∈ [0, 1]. Since the uniform integrability of {Tn(ωp)}p∈(0,1]

p vaguely as p ↑ p(cid:48). Then by continuity, Tn(ωp) → Tn(ω(cid:48)

The following lemma can be proved by a similar way to Lemma 10.

Lemma 11. Q[log Zn] is jointly continuous on [0, 1) × [−∞,∞).

From Lemmas 10 and 11, we obtain Corollaries 1 and 2.
