ABSTRACT

In order to understand the formation of the multipolar structures of the pre-

planetary nebula (PPN) CRL 618, we perform 3D simulations using a multi-

directional bullet model. The optical lobes of CRL 618 and fast molecular out-
ﬂows at the tips of the lobes have been found to have similar expansion ages of ∼

100 yr. Additional fast molecular outﬂows were found near the source along the
outﬂow axes with ages of ∼ 45 yr, suggesting a second episode of bullet ejections.

Thus, in our simulations, two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed. The shap-

ing process is simulated using the ZEUS-3D hydrodynamics code that includes

molecular and atomic cooling. In addition, molecular chemistry is also included

to calculate the CO intensity maps. Our results show the following: (1) Multi-

epoch bullets interacting with the toroidal dense core can produce the collimated
multiple lobes as seen in CRL 618. The total mass of the bullets is ∼ 0.034 M(cid:12),
consistent with the observed high-velocity CO emission in fast molecular out-

ﬂows. (2) The simulated CO J = 3–2 intensity maps show that the low-velocity

cavity wall and the high-velocity outﬂows along the lobes are reasonably consis-

tent with the observations. The position-velocity diagram of the outﬂows along

the outﬂow axes shows a linear increase of velocity with distance, similar to the

observations. The ejections of these bullets could be due to magneto-rotational

explosions or nova-like explosions around a binary companion.

INTRODUCTION

Pre-planetary nebulae (PPNe) are transient objects between the asymptotic giant

branch (AGB) phase and the planetary nebula (PN) phase in the evolution of low- to

intermediate-mass stars. In less than a thousand years, PPNe will transform into PNe

when the central stars evolve to hot white dwarfs and photoionize their envelopes. Most

PPNe are aspherical and found to possess bipolar or multipolar lobes (Corradi & Schwarz

1995; Sahai 2001; Sahai et al. 2007) with kinematic ages less than 1000 yr (Bujarrabal et al.

2001). Bipolar lobes can be produced by fast winds ejected from around central stars near

the end of the AGB phase. However, multipolar PPNe may not be produced in the same

way, because the fast winds, even if precessing, have diﬃculty producing the multipolar

morphology.

CRL 618 is one of the most well-studied multipolar PPNe, and thus a good candidate

for our study of the mass-loss process in multipolar PPNe. In the Hubble Space T elescope

(HST ) images, multipolar optical lobes were observed in the east-west direction (Trammell

& Goodrich 2002). These optical lobes are expanding rapidly away from the center (S´anchez

Contreras et al. 2002). Infrared observations in H2 (Cox et al. 2003), and (sub)millimeter

observations in CO J = 2–1 (S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004), J = 3–2 (Lee et al. 2013a,b),

and J = 6–5 (Nakashima et al. 2007) revealed fast molecular outﬂows along the optical

lobes. A dense core was detected around the central star (Lee et al. 2013a) surrounded by

a tenuous spherical halo (S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004).

Two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations have attempted to reproduce the lobe

morphology of CRL 618. Lee & Sahai (2003) and Lee et al. (2009) used a collimated

fast wind (CFW) model to produce one of the well-deﬁned lobes in the west by using the

ZEUS-2D hydrodynamics code. In the CFW model, the PPN lobes are a result from the

interaction of the fast winds with the surrounding AGB halo. The CFW can reproduce the

– 4 –

structures and kinematics of the outﬂow lobe. However, the CFW may need to be more

conﬁned like a cylindrical jet in order to produce enough shock emission.

On the other hand, Dennis et al. (2008) showed that a massive clump (bullet) model

can also produce the structure and kinematics of a lobe in CRL 618. Recently, Balick et al.

(2013) measured proper motions of the optical lobes and found that the ﬁngertips of the
lobes have the same expansion ages of ∼ 100±15 yr. Therefore, these optical lobes likely

all resulted from a spray of bullets in diﬀerent directions. As a result, Balick et al. (2013)

followed up with the bullet model and included the periodical density enhancement in the

AGB halo in order to produce the observed ringlike structures in the lobe.

Later, the fast molecular outﬂows at the tips of the optical lobes are also found to have

similar expansion ages to the optical lobes (Lee et al. 2013b). This suggests that the optical

lobes and the fast molecular outﬂows likely all resulted from the same spray of bullets.

Additional fast molecular outﬂows are found near the source along the outﬂow axes with
ages of ∼ 45±25 yr, suggesting a second episode of bullet ejections. But the origin of the

bullets is still unknown. The bullet ejections could be due to magneto-rotational explosions

(Matt et al. 2006) or nova-like explosions (Lee et al. 2013a).

More recently, Riera et al. (2014) adopted a precessing jet model (Vel´azquez et al.

2012, 2013) to reproduce the multipolar morphology of CRL 618. If the jet source is also

pulsing and the precession period is an integer multiple of the pulsing period, the jet can

produce multiple lobes. But this model can only produce point-symmetric lobes. In order

to reproduce the asymmetric lobes as seen in CRL 618, a complicated “asymmetrical jet

ejection mechanism” (Montgomery 2012) is required (Vel´azquez et al. 2014).

In this paper, in order to understand the formation of the multipolar structures of CRL

618, we perform 3D simulations using a multi-directional bullet model. Unlike previous

bullet models, our AGB halo has parameters close to those derived from the observations of

– 5 –

CRL 618. In addition, a dense core around the center is also included, as in the observations.

The inclusion of the dense core is important to derive the masses of the bullets accurately,

because the resulting velocity of the bullets depends on the interactions of the bullets with

the dense core. For the ﬁrst attempt, we only model the lobes in the east of CRL 618. As

suggested in Lee et al. (2013b), two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed, ﬁrst with

two bullets to produce the two major lobes, and second with three bullets to produce

the fast molecular outﬂows near the source. The numerical settings and assumptions are

given in section 2; we compare the 3D simulations and simulated CO intensity maps with

observations in section 3; in section 4 we discuss the results and possible origin of bullets;

and we summarize this work in section 5.

2. NUMERICAL SETTINGS

We perform the simulations of the bullet model using the ZEUS-3D code, which is

a grid-based computational ﬂuid dynamics code (Clarke 1996, 2010). The code has been

expanded to include molecular and atomic cooling by Suttner et al. (1997). In addition,

molecular chemistry is also included to calculate the fraction of molecular hydrogen and

atomic hydrogen (Smith & Rosen 2003). The material is assumed to consist of mostly

molecular hydrogen. Helium is also included with the number density nHe = 0.1nH, where

nH is the number density of the hydrogen nuclei. The CO-to-H2 relative abundance is
assumed to be 2×10−4, as adopted in S´anchez Contreras et al. (2004).

In our simulations, a Cartesian coordinate system is used. The x-axis is the polar axis.

The y- and z-axes are in the equatorial plane, perpendicular to the polar axis. We use
576×400×400 cells with a resolution of 12.5 AU per cell to cover from 0 to 7200 AU in the
x-axis, −2500 to 2500 AU in the y-axis, and −2500 to 2500 AU in the z-axis. We adopt a

distance D = 900 pc for CRL 618 (S´anchez Contreras & Sahai 2004). The resolution of

– 6 –

12.5 AU corresponds to an angular resolution ∼ 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 014, high enough to show the details of
the lobes and the outﬂows to be compared with the HST (e.g., up to 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 07 in Balick et al.
2013) and SMA observations (e.g., up to 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 in Lee et al. 2013a) of CRL 618.

In our simulations, a number of bullets are ejected from the central source, interacting

with the surrounding to produce the multipolar lobes. The surrounding consists of an AGB

halo with a dense core at the center.

2.1. Bullets

Figure 1a shows the optical lobes of CRL 618 in the Hα image, taken by the HST in

2009 August. The outﬂow lobes labeled with E1, E2 and E3 are clearly detected in optical.

The labels E4 and E5 indicate the positions of the two molecular outﬂow lobes detected

in the high-velocity CO emission map (Lee et al. 2013b), as shown in Figure 1b. In our

models, bullets are used to produce the optical lobes and the fast molecular outﬂows along

the lobes. According to the observations (Lee et al. 2013b), there would be two episodes

of bullet ejections. In Model 1, two bullets (bullets 1 and 2) are ejected from the central
source in the ﬁrst episode at a simulation time of ∼ 90 yr ago in order to produce the two

major lobes, E1 and E2, in the east of CRL 618. In order to avoid the collision between

the two bullets, the second bullet is ejected 6 yr after the ﬁrst bullet. In Model 2, we add
a second episode of three bullets (bullets 3, 4, and 5) at ∼ 40 yr after the ﬁrst episode, in

order to produce the additional fast outﬂows (lobes E3, E4, and E5) near the source in the

east of CRL 618. Again, in order to avoid the collision between the bullets, we assume that

bullets 3, 4, and 5 are ejected one by one with a time delay of 6 yr. Notice that lobe E3 was

assumed to have a similar dynamical age to lobes E1 and E2 in Balick et al. (2013). Here

it is assumed to have a similar dynamical age to lobes E4 and E5, as in Lee et al. (2013b).

This assumption is reasonable because lobe E3 has a similar length and radial velocity to

lobe E5.

– 7 –

All the bullets are assumed to be ejected from the center. They are cylindrical with

a diameter db = 200 AU and a length lb = 200 AU. In the observations of CRL 618 by

S´anchez Contreras et al. (2004), most of the gas in the fast outﬂows are at temperatures of
∼ 200 K. Therefore, we set the temperature of the bullets to 200 K.

The ejection velocities of the bullets in CRL 618 are unknown, but their lower limits

can be estimated from the transverse velocities (proper motions) of the optical lobes, vt

(Riera et al. 2014) and the radial velocities of the fast outﬂows, vr (Lee et al. 2013b).

Table 1 shows the lower limits calculated with v = (vt

2 + vr

2)1/2. The ejection velocities vb

must be higher than the lower limits but not by much, because the bullets are much denser

than the surrounding. Therefore, in our simulations, we set the ejection velocities to be
slightly higher. As shown in Table 2, the ejection velocities vb are 330 and 350 km s−1 for
bullets 1 and 2, 280 km s−1 for bullet 3, and 240 km s−1 for bullets 4 and 5.

The ejection orientation of the bullets is deﬁned by the position angle, θp, and the

inclination angle, θi = tan−1(vr/vt), of the outﬂow axis of the optical lobes and fast outﬂows,

as listed in Table 1. For example, we assume bullet 1 to be ejected along the outﬂow axis
of lobe E1 which has θp = 90◦ and θi = −24◦ (Fig. 2). This axis is also set to be the x-axis
in our simulations. Since no fast outﬂow was observed at the tip of lobe E2, the inclination
angle of lobe E2 can not be determined. Lobe E2 is assumed to have θi = −32◦, lying
slightly in front of lobe E1. The inclination angle of lobes E4 and E5 are set to −35◦ and
−45◦, similar to the observed values. For lobe E3, the transverse velocity and thus the
inclination angle are uncertain. We set θi = −45◦ for this lobe, like lobe E5.

The bullet mass is set to ∼ 0.011 M(cid:12) for bullets 1 and 2, and 0.004 M(cid:12) for bullets 3,
4, and 5. The total mass of the bullets is therefore ∼ 0.034 M(cid:12). This value is about half
of the total mass (0.065 M(cid:12)) estimated from the total ﬂux of the fast molecular outﬂows

– 8 –

in the east and west of CRL 618 (with |v| > 20 km s−1, Lee et al. 2013b). Therefore, this

value is consistent with the observations. The density of the bullets is given by

ρb =

Mb

π(db/2)2 lb

(1)

where db, lb, and Mb are the diameter, length, and mass of the bullets. As mentioned earlier,
db and lb are both 200 AU. Therefore, the density of the bullets is ∼ (0.4–1.0) ×10−15
g cm−3, and thus the number density of hydrogen nuclei in the bullets is ρb/(1.4mH) ∼
(1.6–4.4)×108 cm−3 (Table 2).

In our model, the densities of the bullets are higher than those adopted in the previous
simulations: Balick et al. (2013) adopted a number density of 4 × 104 cm−3 for the bullet

in their model. Unlike their model, there is a dense core present in our model. Riera et
al. (2014) and Vel´azquez et al. (2014) adopted an average density of 106 cm−3 for the jet

in their precessing jet model. In their model, a dense core is included, with a density of
∼ 106 cm−3 near the source. In our model, the dense core has a density of ∼ 108 cm−3 near
the source (as described in the next section), which is ∼ 2 orders of magnitude higher than

that in their precessing jet model. Thus, higher-density bullets are needed to excavate the

holes in the dense core. As discussed earlier, the total mass of the bullets is 0.034 M(cid:12), still

consistent with the submillimeter observations.

The mass-loss rate is given by

which is ∼ 4× 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 for bullets 1 and 2, and ∼ 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 for bullets 3, 4, and 5.

2.2. The AGB Halo and the Dense Core

The AGB halo is assumed to be spherical symmetric with a constant mass-loss rate.

– 9 –

Thus, the density of the AGB halo is given by

ρ(r) =

˙Ma

4πr2 va

(3)

where ˙Ma is the mass-loss rate assumed to be ∼ 5.5×10−5 M(cid:12) yr−1 (derived from the
number density of molecular hydrogen in Table 1 in S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004, with

Helium added), r is the radial distance to the central source, and va is the expansion
velocity that was found to be ∼ 16 km s−1 (Lee et al. 2013a). Since the bullets move much

faster than the AGB halo, va is set to zero for simplicity, after the density of the AGB halo

is calculated. In observations, the halo of CRL 618 was found to have a temperature of

10–45 K (S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004). Here we set the temperature of the AGB halo to

be 10 K. These two settings of the AGB halo will not aﬀect the dynamics of the outﬂow

lobes to be produced.

The outer part of the dense core has been detected in CRL 618 with a radius of ∼

1100 AU (S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004). However, the actual radius of the dense core

should be larger. Thus, in our simulations, the radius of the dense core Rc is assumed to be

1500 AU. The density distribution is assumed to be toroidal instead of spherical (Fig. 3)

because the dense core seems to be the inner part of the expanding torus detected in the

equatorial plane extending to 5000 AU from the center (S´anchez Contreras & Sahai 2004).

For a toroidal density distribution, the simple form can be written as

ρc(r, θ) = (A + B sin2θ) ρ(r), with ρ(r) =

˙Mc(r)

4πr2 vc(r)

(4)

where θ is the angle measured from the polar axis, A is the isotropic parameter, and B is

the toroidal parameter. The density structure would become spherical when A = 1 and
B = 0. Here, for our toroidal structure, we assume A (cid:39) 0.03 and B (cid:39) 2, so that the density
at θ = 45◦ is about half of that at the equator at the same distance.
˙Mc(r) and vc(r) are

the mass-loss rate and the expansion velocity of the dense core, respectively. The density

– 10 –

proﬁle in the r-axis, ρc(r), is unknown because existing observations do not have enough
resolution to resolve the dense core. Here we assume ρc(r) ∝ r−p. If p = 2 or 3, the density
at the center would become too high for the bullets to penetrate, therefore we use p = 1.

In the observation of Lee et al. (2013a), vc(r) was found to be linearly increasing with the

radius,

have

if ro < r < Rc.

(6)

Therefore, the mass-loss rate of the dense core is ∼ 40 times that of the AGB halo at
r = Rc, and it decreases to that of the AGB halo at r (cid:39) 170 AU. The mean value of the
mass-loss rate of the dense core is ∼ 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1, similar to that obtained by Lee et al.
(2013a), which is ∼ 1.15 × 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Model 1: Two-Bullet Model

Figure 4a shows the column density in Model 1 at 90 yr. As the two bullets are ejected

into the dense core and AGB halo, they produce two collimated lobes, E1 and E2. For these
two lobes, the lengths are ∼ 6000 AU and the transverse widths are ∼ 1000 AU, similar

to the observed lengths and widths of the two major lobes, E1 and E2, of CRL 618. The

column density shows that the majority of the bullet mass is still at the tips, which could

be traced by the fast molecular outﬂows (Lee et al. 2013b).

– 11 –

3.2. Model 2: Five-Bullet Model

In Model 2, ﬁve bullets are ejected in two episodes, producing the ﬁve eastern lobes of

CRL 618 (Fig. 4b). In the ﬁrst episode, two bullets are ejected, producing lobes E1 and E2.
In the second episode (∼ 40 yr after the ﬁrst episode), three bullets are ejected, producing
lobes E3, E4, and E5. Lobe E3 has an inclination angle of −45◦ in the northeast, and it is
the smallest lobe with a length of ∼ 2200 AU, as seen in the observation. The lengths of
lobes E4 and E5 are ∼ 2800 AU and 2300 AU, respectively. A U-shaped cavity wall is seen

at the base, consisting of swept-up material in the dense core.

3.3. Comparison with CO Observations

Since Model 2 can reproduce the structures of the ﬁve eastern lobes of CRL 618, here

we choose this model to be compared with the observations. Since CO J = 3–2 has been
observed at very high resolution of ∼ 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 and found to trace the fast molecular outﬂows
reasonably well (Lee et al. 2013b), we calculate the CO J = 3–2 intensity maps and the

position-velocity (PV) diagrams from Model 2 and compare them to the observations of

the molecular outﬂows in the east of CRL 618. We use a radiative transfer code with an

assumption of local thermal equilibrium (LTE) to calculate the CO emission. The x-axis is
tilted toward us from the plane of the sky by 24◦. The systemic velocity is −21.5 km s−1,

as adopted for CRL 618 in Lee et al. (2013a).

Figure 5 shows the comparison of low-velocity (LV) CO J = 3–2 emission between the

observation and the model for the east side of CRL 618. The ﬁgures are plotted over the

HST Hα image of CRL 618 (Lee et al. 2013b) in order to show the relative distribution of

the molecular outﬂows along the optical lobes. In the observation (Fig. 5a), the low-velocity

emission shows a U-shaped cavity wall encompassing the two major lobes, with the northern

– 12 –

part around the northern edge of the E1 lobe and the southern part around the southern

edge of the E2 lobe, extending away from the central source. A similar cavity wall is seen

around the western lobe as well. These structures are also seen in the lower transition line

of CO at J = 2–1 (S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004).

In the model (Fig. 5b), the low-velocity emission also shows a U-shaped cavity wall
encompassing the E1 and E2 lobes, extending to ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 7 from the source. The emission is
from the swept-up material in the dense core, which has a radius of 1500 AU (∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 7).
Unlike the observation, however, no emission is seen extending over ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 7 from the source
to ∼ 4(cid:48)(cid:48) to the northeast. In our model, that region is within the AGB halo. Thus, in

order to produce detectable emission there, the AGB halo could be denser than currently

assumed in our model.

Figure 6 shows the comparison of high-velocity (HV) CO J = 3–2 emissions between

the observation and the model. Both panels are also plotted over the HST images of CRL
618. In the observation (Fig. 6a), high-velocity (−183.2 to −114.1 km s−1) emission is

observed at the tips of lobes E1, E3, E4, and E5, but not observed at the tip of lobe E2. In

the model, high-velocity emission, with a similar velocity range to that in the observation,

is predicted to be seen at the tips of all the lobes. The velocity of the emission increases

with distance, similar to that seen in the observation. Notice that the emission intensity

in our model is about half of that observed and thus more bullet mass may be needed to

produce more HV CO emission. The reason for no HV emission being detected at the tip

of and along the southern edge of lobe E2 is unknown.

Figures 7a and 7b show the PV diagrams of the observed outﬂows in CO, cut along

the axis of lobes E1 and E2. Figures 7c and 7d show the same PV diagrams but calculated

from the model. In these diagrams, lobes E4 and E5 can also been seen. In Figures 7c and

7d, the bullets are seen at the tips of the outﬂows and thus are traced by the fast molecular

– 13 –

outﬂows. The diagrams also show that the velocities of the molecular outﬂows decrease

linearly with the distance to the central source, as seen in the observations. The slope of the

PV structure is roughly equal to p/vr = t/tanθi, where p is the projected distance from the

center, and t is the time after ejection. Therefore, diﬀerent slopes are seen for the outﬂows

in diﬀerent ejection episodes. Notice that since no molecular emission is detected for lobe

E2, no PV structure is detected for lobe E2 in the observation, as shown in Figure 7b.

4. DISCUSSIONS

4.1. Physical Properties of the Dense Core

In order to test our bullet models realistically, the physical parameters of the dense

core are set to be close to those derived from the observations. The dense core is assumed

to be toroidal, because the dense core seems to be the inner part of the expanding torus

detected in the equatorial plane extending to 5000 AU from the center (S´anchez Contreras

& Sahai 2004). In addition, bipolar and multipolar PPNe are often seen with dense tori

at their waists (Kwok et al. 1998; Su et al. 1998; Volk et al. 2007; Sahai et al. 2008). The
dense core is assumed to have a mean mass-loss rate of ∼ 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1, similar to the
observed values [∼ 0.7 × 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 in the outer part (S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004,
with Helium added) and 1.2× 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1 in the inner part (Lee et al. 2013a)].

On the other hand, the density proﬁle of the dense core is uncertain and assumed to
be proportional to r−1 in our models for the ﬁrst attempt. In the observations, the outer
part of the dense core was observed with an angular resolution of ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 1 and thus was not
resolved (S´anchez Contreras et al. 2004). The density proﬁle there was assumed to be
proportional to r−2 to model the observed emission. The inner part of the dense core was
observed with an angular resolution of ∼ 0(cid:48)(cid:48). 5 and thus was also not resolved (Lee et al.

– 14 –

2013a). The density proﬁle there was assumed to be proportional to r−3, in order to have

a constant mass-loss rate. These two density proﬁles are steeper than the density proﬁle

used in our models. If we used those steeper density proﬁles, the density in the innermost

part of the dense core would be higher and thus more massive bullets would be needed

to penetrate the dense core. Observations at higher angular resolution with the Atacama

Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are needed to resolve the dense core in

order to better constrain the density proﬁle of the dense core and thus the parameters of

the bullets.

4.2. Multipolar Features: Precession or Bullet Ejections?

Precessing jet models have been used to reproduce the multipolar structures of CRL

618. However, a standard precessing jet model would produce point-symmetric multipolar

lobes about the central source (Riera et al. 2014), inconsistent with the observations,

which show asymmetric multipolar lobes about the central source. In order to produce the

asymmetric multipolar lobes, Vel´azquez et al. (2014) adopted an asymmetrical jet-ejection

mechanism for the precessing jet model. In this case, the morphology and the kinematics

of the lobes can be in reasonable agreement with the observations. Nonetheless, the

jet-ejection mechanism is complicated, requiring an alternation in the ejections of the jet

from two sides of the precessing accretion disk around a binary companion.

Here, we extend the one-bullet model studied earlier in Dennis et al. (2008) and Balick

et al. (2013) to the multi-directional bullet model in order to produce the multipolar lobes

in CRL 618. In order to have a more realistic comparison with the observations, we also

include the dense core detected recently in CRL 618 (Lee et al. 2013a) and set the physical

parameters of our bullets using the fast molecular outﬂows recently detected in Lee et al.

(2013b). As discussed earlier, our model can reproduce the morphology and the kinematics

– 15 –

of the multipolar lobes in the east of CRL 618 reasonably well. Since the lobes in the

west are diﬀerent from those in the east, a diﬀerent set of bullets are needed to produce

them. Notice that two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed in our model, based on the

observations of fast molecular outﬂows in Lee et al. (2013b). However, since all the optical

lobes were found to have similar dynamical ages (Balick et al. 2013), the bullets could also

be ejected at the same time. Further observations are needed to determine this.

Although both of the precessing jet model and our multi-directional bullet model can

produce the multiple lobes, there is an observational diﬀerence for the shock structures at

the tips of the lobes between the two models. As seen in Figure 4 of Vel´azquez et al. (2014),

the synthetic image shows that the shapes of the shocks produced by precessing jets are

blunt (U-shaped). In our bullet model, on the other hand, the shapes at the tips of the

lobes are sharp (V-shaped). In the observations of CRL 618, the shapes of the shocks are

as sharp as those seen in our simulations.

4.3. The Origin of Bullets

The origin of the bullets is still uncertain. Dennis et al. (2008) argued that the bullets

may be driven by an explosive magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) mechanism (see Matt et

al. 2006). Near the end of the AGB phase, the central star rotates very fast so that the

magnetic ﬁeld can be highly twisted near the central star. If the magnetic ﬁeld is strong

enough, the magnetic pressure force can drive a magneto-rotational explosion. Such an

explosion event could produce multiple bullets simultaneously, producing the multipolar

lobes of CRL 618. Further study is needed to determine if this kind of explosion can occur

twice, as needed in our simulations.

Interestingly, extremely low isotope ratios of 12C/13C (∼ 10) and 14N/15N (tentatively

– 16 –

found to be ∼ 150) were found in the dense core at the center (Lee et al. 2013a). These

low isotope ratios are unexpected to be seen in a C-rich dense core (Milam et al. 2009;

Palmerini et al. 2011), such as that in CRL 618. As suggested in Lee et al. (2013a), these

low ratios could be due to a hot CNO cycle as in a nova-like explosion. If this is the case,

then the bullets could be ejected by these explosions. Theoretically, a nova requires a close

binary system with the secondary being a white dwarf, and it is triggered by the accretion

of hydrogen gas from the primary onto the white dwarf. The hydrogen gas can be pulled

onto the surface of the white dwarf and then form an envelope massive enough to ignite

the hot CNO cycles. If this is the case in CRL 618, then the center would be a binary

system. This binary system in turn could produce the ﬂattened common envelope around

the center, seen as the expanding torus.

In our model, there are two episodes of bullet ejections. The ﬁrst episode occurred

about 90 yr ago, and the second episode occurred about 50 yr ago. Interestingly, by

studying the HII region at the center, Tafoya et al. (2013) found that CRL 618 turned from

a PPN into a PN at the center about 50 yr ago. Thus, it is possible that the second episode

of bullet ejection is related to the formation of the HII region at the center and thus the

evolutionary phase change of the central star.

5. CONCLUSIONS

With hydrodynamical simulations, we have studied the shaping mechanism of the

multipolar PPN CRL 618 using a multi-directional bullet model. In our simulations, we
include a spherical AGB halo with a mass-loss rate of ∼ 5.5 × 10−5 M(cid:12) yr−1 and a toroidal
dense core with a mean mass-loss rate of ∼ 10−3 M(cid:12) yr−1, as found in previous observations.
Also, based on previous observations of fast molecular outﬂows in the east of the central
source, we assume two episodes of bullet ejection, with the ﬁrst at ∼ 90 yr ago and the

second at ∼ 50 yr ago, and with a total mass of ∼ 0.034 M(cid:12).

– 17 –

We ﬁnd that our simulations can reproduce the morphology of the multipolar lobes in

the east of CRL 618. The simulated CO emissions show the structure and the kinematics

of the molecular outﬂows similar to those seen in the observations. At low velocity, the

emission shows a similar cavity wall to that seen in the observations, surrounding the two
major lobes in the east extending to ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 7 from the source. However, in order to produce
the observed emission extending from ∼ 1(cid:48)(cid:48). 7 to 4(cid:48)(cid:48), the AGB halo might need to be denser
than that assumed here. At high velocity, the emission is distributed at the tips of all the

lobes. The velocity increases with the distance, similar to that seen in the observation.

Since the intensity is about half of that observed, more massive bullets might be needed.

The origin of the bullets is unknown. The ejection of these bullets could be due

to magneto-rotational explosions or nova-like explosions around a binary companion.

Interestingly, the more recent ejection at about 50 yr ago could be related to the formation

of the HII region at the center when CRL 618 turned from a PPN into a PN.
