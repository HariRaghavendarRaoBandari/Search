Chiral magnets are very promising ingredients for spin-
tronic based devices since they support peculiar magnetic
textures that aﬀect the charge and spin transport proper-
ties in diﬀerent ways. As these magnetic textures can be
deeply altered by magnetic ﬁelds, the transport proper-
ties can be magnetically controlled [1]. In the mono-axial
helimagnet, the competition between the ferromagnetic
(FM) and Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interactions at
low T leads to a magnetic helix propagating with period
L0 along a crystallographic axis, which will be called the
DM axis. At a critical temperature T0 a magnetic tran-
sition to a paramagnetic (PM) phase takes place. For
temperatures lower than T0, application of a magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the DM axis deforms the helix
and a Chiral Soliton Lattice (CSL) appears [2, 3]. This
CSL, which is realised in CrNb3S6 [4], supports dynami-
cal modes like coherent sliding [5] and gives rise to inter-
esting phenomena like spin motive forces [6] and tuneable
magnetoresistence [7–10]. By increasing the ﬁeld the pe-
riod of the CSL increases and, eventually, as the period
diverges, a transition takes place continuously to a forced
FM state (FFM). The nature of the transition in the
vicinity of T0 in presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld
is not fully understood and considerable eﬀort is being
devoted to clarify this interesting question in mono-axial
helimagnets [8–12].

In this letter the magnetic phase diagram Hx−T is the-
oretically studied. The thermal ﬂuctuations are treated
classically and therefore the results are not valid at very
low T , where it is well known that a quantum treatment
of thermal ﬂuctuations is necessary, for instance, to re-
produce the behaviour of the speciﬁc heat. The classi-
cal approximation is thus valid in the zero T limit, as
quantum ﬂuctuations of the ground state are neglected
and thermal ﬂuctuations absent, and at high T , where

quantum ﬂuctuations are again neglected and thermal
ﬂuctuations can be treated classically.

Let us consider a classical spin system with FM ex-
change and mono-axial DM interactions, and single-ion
easy-plane anisotropy, at temperature T and in pres-
ence of an applied magnetic ﬁeld ~H. The hamilto-
is the sum of HFM = −P~r,ˆe Jˆe ~S~r · ~S~r+ˆe,
nian, H,
HDM = −D P~r ˆz · (~S~r × ~S~r+ˆz), HA = K P~r(ˆz · ~S~r)2,
and HZ = −gµB ~H · P~r
~S~r, where ~r labels the magnetic
lattice points, ˆe is one vector of the orthonormal basis
{ˆx, ˆy, ˆz}, with ˆz pointing along the DM axis, and Jˆz = J,
Jˆx = Jˆy = ξJ, D, and K are the magnetic interaction
constants.

The statistical properties are given by the partition
function, Z = R [dˆn] exp(−H[ˆn]/kBT ), where ˆn = ~S/S is
a unit vector in the spin direction, [dˆn] = Q~r d2 ˆn~r, and
d2ˆn is the invariant measure over the unit sphere. To
evaluate Z we use the variational mean ﬁeld approxima-
tion [13], which is the lowest order term of a systematic
loop expansion [14]. Let us describe it brieﬂy. Consider
~M~r·ˆn~r, where the mean
the trial “hamiltonian” H0 = P~r
ﬁeld ~M~r is, in principle, arbitrary, and deﬁne the expec-
tation value h·i0 of any functional O of {ˆn~r} as hOi0 =
(1/Z0)R [dˆn] exp(−H0)O, where Z0 = R [dˆn] exp(−H0).
Obviously we have Z = Z0hexp(H0 − H/kBT )i0, and,
due to the convexity of the exponential function, the fol-
lowing inequality holds: Z ≥ Z0 exp(hH0i0−hHi0/kBT ).
In terms of the free energy, F = −kBT lnZ, the inequal-
ity reads F ≤ F0, where F0 = hHi0− kBT (hH0i0− lnZ0)
is a functional of the mean ﬁeld conﬁguration. Hence, the
best approximation to the true free energy F is obtained
with the mean ﬁeld conﬁguration which minimizes F0.
The key point is that it is easy to compute F0, which
in the continuum limit reads F0 = (JS2/a)R d3rf0(~r),
where a is an eﬀective distance between magnetic ions in
the ˆz direction, and

~β = (gµB/JSa2) ~H, α = kBT /JS2a2, ~m = hˆni0 = F ~M ,
and F = coth(M )/M − 1/M 2. We only deal with

magnetic ﬁelds perpendicular to the DM axis, so that
βy = βz = 0, and γ = 2.58q2
0 ensures the relation
Hz0 ≈ 10Hx0 between the parallel and perpendicular

critical ﬁelds observed in CrNb3S6. Computations per-
formed with γ = 0 showed that, as the ﬁeld is purely per-
pendicular, the single-ion anisotropy has a very small in-
ﬂuence on the results. In the continuum model the eﬀect
of long range FM interactions, which have not been ex-
plicitly written in the hamiltonian, is merely to increase
the eﬀective magnetic ion distance a and to change the
value of µ2. Also, the presence of magnetic vacants can
be taken into account by increasing a and modifying the
values of the interaction constants and of µ2. The pa-

2

rameter µ2, therefore, has to be large, as we work in the
continuum limit, but otherwise can be tuned in order to
reproduce the experimental results on the phase diagram.
The minimum of F0 is a solution of the correspond-
ing Euler-Lagrange equations. As the minimum depends
only on z, and Mz = 0, they read
~M ′′ = Ω ~M ′+Φ ~M +2q0ˆz×[ ~M ′−(Ω/2) ~M]−(βx/F )ˆx, (2)
where the prime stands for the derivative with respect to
z, Ω = −2(F1/F )M ′, and, with Fk = dkF/dM k,

Φ = (F1/M G)hM ′2 − ~M ′2 + (2F1/F − F2/F1)M M ′2 + 2q0ˆz · ( ~M × ~M ′) + γ/G + ~β · ~M /Fi + (α − µ2q2

0F )/G. (3)

The general solution of the system of two second or-
der diﬀerential equations for Mx and My (2) contains
four arbitrary integration constants. The task is to ﬁnd
the particular solution which minimises F0 following the
method described in [15]. On physical grounds, we ex-
pect a periodic ground state, with period L. Hence, the
free energy density ¯f0 = F0/V , where V is the volume,
is equal to the free energy averaged over one period, that
is ¯f0 = (1/L)R L
0 f0(z)dz, and the boundary conditions
(BC) are ~M (0) = ~M (L). Since the equations are sec-
ond order periodicity requires also the equality of the
ﬁrst derivatives at the boundaries, i.e. ~M ′(0) = ~M ′(L).
These additional conditions cannot be generally imposed
on the boundary value problem (BVP), since it would be
overdetermined. We used the following strategy: with no
loss, set My(0) = My(L) = 0, and for given L and Mx(0),
solve numerically the BVP; for ﬁxed L, tune Mx(0) until
periodicity is reached; then, compute ¯f0 via a numeri-
cal quadrature algorithm. The physical period L is the
minimum of ¯f0.

To obtain the phase diagram we compare the free en-
ergies of the FFM (or PM) and CSL states. The FFM
state is always a solution of Eqs. (2) and its magnetiza-
tion obeys the equation γM F + µ2q2
0 − α/F = βx. For
βx = 0 the problem can be analytically solved. At low
α the free energy is minimized by an helix with pitch q0
independent of α, and modulus M0, which is the solution
of F (M0) = α/(µ2q2
0) and decreases monotonically with
α from M0 = ∞ (what implies saturation of magnetiza-
tion) at α = 0 to M0 = 0 at α0 = (µ2 + 1)q2
0/3 + 2γ/15.
Above α0 the ground state is PM. The transition takes
place continuously and M0 vanishes as a power law:
M0 ∼ (α0 − α)1/2. For low βx and low α the ground
state is a slightly distorted helix. By increasing α or βx
a transition to the FFM state takes place. For α = 0 the
critical ﬁeld is βx0 = (π2/16)q2
0.

on µ2. The blue and red lines correspond, respectively with a
second and ﬁrst order phase transition. The pink dotted line
marks the onset of the highly non-linear CSL.

T = 0, Hx0 = (kBT0/gSµB)βx0/α0, where T0 is the
zero-ﬁeld critical temperature. At low T the CSL state
continuously approaches the FFM as its period diverges,
and the transition is continuous. In the vicinity of T0,
however, the transition is discontinuous, the two states
coexist on the transition line, and both are present in its
neighborhood, one as stable and the other as metastable
state. The continuous and discontinuous transition lines
are separated by a tricritical point, (Tt, Hxt). We shall
denote by Hxc(T ) or by Tc(Hx) the critical ﬁeld or tem-
perature at given T or Hx, respectively. In terms of the
dimensionless magnitudes T /T0 and Hx/Hx0 the shape
of the transition line is independent of µ2. However,
the position of the tricritical point on the line depends
on µ2, and to high accuracy is given by the equations
Tt/T0 = 1 − 3.6/µ2, Hxt/Hx0 = 2.4/µ. Notice also that
the phase diagram depends on µ2 through Hx0 and T0.
The results shown from now on are obtained for µ2 = 120.

FIG. 2. Magnetization per magnetic ion as a function of Hx
for ﬁxed T (left) and of T for ﬁxed Hx (right).

The magnetization, M = gµB|(1/L)R L

0 h~S(z)idz|,
shows a ﬁnite jump on the ﬁrst order line, while it is
continuous on the second order line (Fig. 2), where it
presents a singularity which is controlled by the diver-
gence of the period, L, as the diﬀerence between the
magnetization on the CSL and FFM phases scales as
1/L. The numerical results show that when the tran-
sition point is approached keeping T constant then L
satisﬁes the scaling law B(Aq0L + 1) exp(−Aq0L) ∼
(Hxc−Hx)/Hx0. This scaling law, which also holds along
the continuous transition line in the (Hx, Hz) plane at
T = 0 [15], is motivated by the scaling law at T = 0, given
by (√βx0L + 1) exp(−√βx0L) ∼ (βx0 − βx)/8βx0. Fig. 3

(left) displays the scaling of L for T /T0 = 0.86. The
same scaling law holds if the transition line is approached
by keeping Hx constant, with the right hand side scal-
ing variable substituted by (Tc − T )/T0. Fig. 3 (right)
displays this scaling for Hx/Hx0 = 0.46422606, which
corresponds to the transition at T /T0 = 0.86. Therefore
the scaling of L is a universal feature of the CSL. The
coeﬃcient A is independent of the direction (constant T
or Hx) along which the transition point is approached,
and it is thus a feature of the transition point; B, how-
ever, depends on the approaching direction. Both A and
B change continuously along the second order line, in-
creasing with temperature, and diverge as the tricritical
point is approached (Fig. 4 left). Thus, the behaviour
of A and B may be used to locate the tricritical point
experimentally. The divergence of A and B means that
the singular behaviour at the tricritical point is diﬀerent
from that along the continuous line, as expected. Unfor-
tunately, it is not possible to determine numerically this
singular behaviour without further insight.

The period increases with the ﬁeld from its value at
zero ﬁeld, L0, and, at non-zero ﬁeld, also with temper-
ature. Initially its growth is modest, and the magnetic
state correspond with a slightly distorted helix, which
may be called a quasi-linear CSL. However, beyond a
certain ﬁeld, or temperature, the period increases rapidly
and a highly non-linear CSL (HNL-CSL) is formed. This
non-linearity onset, deﬁned as the line on which the third
harmonic of the magnetic structure reaches 20% of the
fundamental wave-vector intensity, is marked by the pink

dotted line in Fig. 1, could be related to the behaviour of
magnetization and the AC susceptibility reported in [9]
and [11], respectively.

The HNL-CSL develops only for ﬁelds above the tri-
critical ﬁeld, in good agreement with the experimental
results of [11]. For higher temperatures the transition
to the FFM state takes place discontinuously from a
slightly distorted helix, before the HNL-CSL is formed.
Thus, the soliton density L0/L is an order parameter
for the transition.
Its behaviour along the transition
line, parametrized by T /T0, is displayed in Fig. 4 (right).
Along the ﬁrst order line the soliton density drops dis-
continuously to zero from a ﬁnite value. The gap van-
ishes at the tricritical point with a power law singularity,
with exponent 1/4 (Fig. 4 right). The soliton density is
a nearly universal function, independent of T , of the di-
mensionless ﬁeld Hx/Hx0 (Fig. 5 left), what explains the
universality of the magnetoresistance curves of Ref. 8.

The speciﬁc heat is also singular on the transition lines,
showing a narrow peak also observed in [16]. On the ﬁrst
order line it has a ﬁnite jump whereas it diverges on the
second order line (Fig. 5). The broad peak at higher
temperature is associated to the crossover from PM to
FFM behaviour, which is signaled by the dashed line in
Fig. 1. The crossover temperature is close T0 for all values
of the ﬁeld, in agreement with [9] and [11].

Two tricritical points appear in the T = 0 phase dia-
gram for a magnetic ﬁeld in the plane (Hx, Hz) [15]. The
one labeled as TC2 in [15] has the same features as the
tricritical point found here. A tricritical line connecting
these two points is then expected in the tridimensional
phase diagram (T, Hx, Hz). Although the method of this
work is not valid at very low T , the qualitative features
of the phase diagram will probably remain valid as they
interpolate from the zero T limit to the high T regime.
The transition line (Fig. 1) can be reproduced in a
simple way by assuming that the only eﬀect of tem-
perature is to decrease uniformly the value of the lo-
cal spin, m(z) = |h~S(z)i|/S, so that m is indepen-
dent of z. Then the problem is reduced to the solution

of a chiral sine-Gordon equation with an eﬀective ﬁeld
βx/m(α, βx). The numerical results show that the local
magnetic moment in the CSL phase is nearly indepen-
dent of βx. Thus, neglecting the βx dependence of m,
the approximation gives by Hxc/Hx0 = m0(T ), where
m0(T ) = M0F (M0) and M0 is the zero-ﬁeld mean ﬁeld
solution (see above). This equation describes the transi-
tion line with very high accuracy. However, it does not
capture the nature of the transitions nor the tricritical
behaviour. The local magnetic moment m0(T ), obtained
in the mean ﬁeld approximation, may be not accurate.
However, if we consider its exact value, |h~SiT|, which
can be measured by neutron scattering, the approxima-
tion predicts a relationship between the critical ﬁelds and
local magnetic moments at two diﬀerent temperatures:
Hxc(T )/Hxc(T ′)/ = |h~SiT|/|h~SiT ′|.

The recent experimental ﬁndings on the phase diagram
of CrNb3S6 can be understood in the light of the present
theoretical study. The results of [4] for a crystal with

4

T0 ≈ 127 K and Hxc ≈ 2300 Oe at 110 K are reproduced
with µ2 ≈ 210, and the tricritical point is predicted to be
at Tt ≈ 125 K and Hxt ≈ 910 Oe. The ﬁrst order transi-
tion in the vicinity of T0, the second order transition at
lower T , the presence of a tricritical point at the predicted
location, and the non existence of HNL-CSL for ﬁelds be-
low Hxt are consistent with the phase diagram reported
in [11]. Furthermore, the universality found for the soli-
ton density curves explains the universality of the mag-
netoresistance curves of [8]. The phase diagram drawn
in [9], which has T0 ≈ 120 K and Hxc ≈ 1300 Oe at 110
K, is reproduced with µ2 ≈ 310 and a tricritical point is
predicted at 119 K and 490 Oe, in a region which has not
been fully explored in [9].
