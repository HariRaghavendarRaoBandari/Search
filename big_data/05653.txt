ABSTRACT
We study the origin of the stellar α-element-to-iron abundance ratio, [α/Fe]∗, of present-day
central galaxies, using cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations from the Evolution and
Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project. For galaxies with stellar
masses of M∗ > 1010.5 M(cid:12), [α/Fe]∗ increases with increasing galaxy stellar mass and age.
These trends are in good agreement with observations of early-type galaxies, and are consis-
tent with a ‘downsizing’ galaxy formation scenario: more massive galaxies have formed the
bulk of their stars earlier and more rapidly, hence from an interstellar medium (ISM) that was
mostly α-enriched by massive stars. In the absence of feedback from active galactic nuclei
(AGN), however, [α/Fe]∗ in M∗ > 1010.5 M(cid:12) galaxies is roughly constant with stellar mass
and decreases with mean stellar age, extending the trends found for lower-mass galaxies in
both simulations with and without AGN. We conclude that AGN feedback can account for
the α-enhancement of massive galaxies, as it suppresses their star formation, quenching more
massive galaxies at earlier times, thereby preventing the iron from longer-lived intermediate-
mass stars (supernova Type Ia) from being incorporated into younger stars.

INTRODUCTION

The chemical abundances of galaxies hold valuable information
about their formation and evolution. Galaxies build up their stel-
lar mass content from gas accreted from the intergalactic medium
(IGM) (e.g. Kereš et al. 2005; van de Voort et al. 2011) and by recy-
cling the stellar mass released by evolved stellar populations (e.g.
Kennicutt et al. 1994; Leitner & Kravtsov 2011; Segers et al. 2016).
While the former is predominantly metal-poor, stellar ejecta are
intrinsically metal-rich. Stellar populations enrich the interstellar
medium (ISM) by means of supernova (SN) explosions and winds
from massive and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, where the
ejecta from each channel are characterized by a distinctive abun-
dance pattern and are released into the ISM on different timescales.
However, IGM accretion dilutes the enriched ISM, and galactic out-
ﬂows can remove enriched gas from the ISM, thereby altering its
chemical content in a time-dependent way. Since stars retain the
abundances of the ISM in which they were formed, the stellar abun-
dances of galaxies represent a fossil record of their formation his-
tory.

In particular, core collapse SNe release mostly α-elements,
i.e. elements that are a multiple of the He (α) particle – includ-
ing O, Ne, Mg, and Si (e.g. Woosley & Weaver 1995). In contrast,

SN Type Ia ejecta, which are released with a temporal delay rela-
tive to core collapse SN ejecta, consist almost entirely of Fe (e.g.
Thielemann et al. 2003). As a consequence, the abundance ratio of
O to Fe of mass released by a stellar population decreases with time
(see ﬁg. 3 of Wiersma et al. 2009b: from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr, this ra-
tio decreases by about 0.3 dex). The α-element-to-iron abundance
ratio (also referred to as α-enhancement, when it is compared to
the solar abundance ratio) has therefore been used extensively to
study the formation history of local, mainly early-type, galaxies
(e.g. Trager et al. 2000; Thomas et al. 2010; Johansson et al. 2012;
Conroy et al. 2014). A common ﬁnding of these studies is that
the α-enhancement increases with increasing galaxy stellar mass
or velocity dispersion, which is generally interpreted as evidence
for galactic ‘downsizing’. In this galaxy formation scenario, mas-
sive galaxies form the bulk of their stars earlier and over a shorter
period of time than low-mass galaxies (e.g. Cowie et al. 1996; Neis-
tein et al. 2006), which is reﬂected by their chemical content: due to
their short formation timescales, their stars are primarily enriched
in α-elements, released by massive stars on short timescales. The
crucial element in the downsizing scenario is a mechanism that ef-
ﬁciently quenches star formation in massive galaxies, and in such
a way that more massive galaxies are quenched at earlier times.
An obvious candidate is the energy feedback from active galactic
nuclei (AGN).

Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project
(Schaye et al. 2015, hereafter S15; Crain et al. 2015) to study the
relation of stellar α-enhancement with galaxy stellar mass and age
of central galaxies at z = 0, and investigate the role played by AGN
feedback in reproducing the trends observed for massive, early-
type galaxies. The ﬁducial EAGLE ‘reference’ model reproduces
key observational galaxy properties such as the evolution of the
galaxy stellar mass function (Furlong et al. 2015b), the sizes of ac-
tive and passive galaxies and their evolution (Furlong et al. 2015a),
and the distribution of galaxies in the colour-magnitude diagram
(Trayford et al. 2015). The present-day mass-metallicity relation
is reproduced over the mass range of interest here (M∗ (cid:38) 1010
M(cid:12); S15) (and higher-resolution EAGLE simulations of smaller
volumes extend this agreement to lower masses; S15). In addition
to the reference model, the EAGLE set of simulations includes a
model variation in which the subgrid implementation of AGN feed-
back has been turned off, enabling us to isolate the effect of AGN
feedback on galaxy α-enhancement. In Section 2 we describe the
simulation set-up and implemented subgrid physics. In Section 3
we present galaxy α-enhancement as a function of stellar mass and
age, and show that AGN feedback is responsible for the trends that
are also observed for massive, early-type galaxies. We give our con-
clusions in Section 4.

2 SIMULATIONS

The EAGLE simulations were run with a modiﬁed version
the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GAD-
of
GET3 (last described by Springel 2005). Changes
include
the use of a pressure-entropy formulation of SPH (Hopkins
2013; see also Schaller et al. 2015) and the time-step lim-
iter of Durier & Dalla Vecchia (2012). The simulations adopt
a Λ cold dark matter cosmology with parameters taken from
Planck Collaboration et al. (2014): [Ωm, Ωb, ΩΛ, σ8, ns, h] =
[0.307, 0.04825, 0.693, 0.8288, 0.9611, 0.6777].

To investigate the effect of AGN feedback on galaxy α-
enhancement, we compare the results from two simulations: the
EAGLE reference model (Ref in S15) and a model for which the
AGN feedback subgrid implementation has been turned off, while
keeping all the other subgrid parameters the same (NoAGN). These
were run in periodic volumes of size L = 50 comoving Mpc
(cMpc), containing N = 7523 dark matter particles with mass
mdm = 9.7 × 106 M(cid:12) and an equal number of baryonic particles
with initial mass mb = 1.8× 106 M(cid:12). The gravitational softening
length is set to 2.66 comoving kpc and limited to a maximum of 0.7
proper kpc at low redshift. In addition, since we are primarily con-
cerned with high-mass (M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12)) galaxies, we also use the
L = 100 cMpc, N = 15043 (hence identical mass resolution and
softening length) simulation of the reference model to show trends
of α-enhancement with stellar mass and age, which provides better
sampling of the massive galaxy population.

The simulations include a number of subgrid models for phys-
ical processes that originate on scales that they do not resolve.
These include star formation, which is modelled with a metallicity-
dependent onset threshold (Schaye 2004) and a pressure-dependent
star formation law that reproduces the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
(Schaye & Dalla Vecchia 2008). Gas particles that are converted
into star particles represent stellar populations of a single age, with
their mass (distributed according to the Chabrier 2003 initial mass
function; IMF) and metallicity inherited from their progenitor gas
particles. The simulations follow the abundances of 11 elements

(including O and Fe), as these are gradually released into the ISM
according to the prescriptions of Wiersma et al. (2009b). These
abundances are used to calculate the rates of radiative cooling and
heating (Wiersma et al. 2009a). For each star particle, the rate of
SN Type Ia per unit stellar mass is νe−t/τ , where t is the stellar
age, and the parameters τ = 2 Gyr and ν = 2 × 10−3 M−1(cid:12) were
chosen to reproduce the evolution of the observed SN Type Ia rate
density (S15).

The EAGLE reference model includes a prescription for the
growth of black holes (BHs), which increase their mass via mergers
and gas accretion, where the accretion rate depends on the angular
momentum of the gas (Rosas-Guevara et al. 2015, S15). Energy
feedback from star formation and AGN (the latter is omitted in the
NoAGN model) is implemented by stochastically heating gas par-
ticles surrounding newly formed star particles and BH particles,
respectively, up to a minimum temperature increase (Dalla Vecchia
& Schaye 2012), so that galactic winds develop naturally without
turning off the radiative cooling or hydrodynamics. The subgrid
parameters governing the efﬁciencies of stellar and AGN feedback
have been calibrated to reproduce the observed present-day galaxy
stellar mass function and the relation between stellar mass and BH
mass, with the additional constraint that the sizes of galaxies must
be reasonable (S15; Crain et al. 2015).

Haloes are identiﬁed using the Friends-of-Friens (FoF) and
SUBFIND algorithms (Dolag et al. 2009). In this work, we are only
concerned with ‘central’ galaxies, which are the galaxies residing
at the minimum of the FoF halo potentials. Following S15, we use
a 3D spherical aperture of radius 30 pkpc to calculate galaxy prop-
erties.

We adopt the usual deﬁnition of the stellar abundance ratio,

as oxygen dominates the α-elements in terms of mass fraction.

3 RESULTS

To investigate the effect of AGN feedback on the stellar α-
enhancement of galaxies, we ﬁrst show the impact on the trend
with stellar mass. Then, since α-enhancement is often used as a
proxy for galaxy age, we explore the impact of AGN feedback on
the relation between [α/Fe]∗ and age.

3.1 Relation with stellar mass

Fig. 1 shows the stellar α-enhancement, [α/Fe]∗ (represented by
[O/Fe]∗), as a function of galaxy stellar mass, comparing EAGLE
simulations with (purple, solid line) and without (red, dashed line)
AGN feedback. As we showed previously (Segers et al. 2016), for
the largest EAGLE simulation (grey, solid line), [α/Fe]∗ is roughly
constant at ∼ 0.25 for M∗ (cid:46) 1010.5 M(cid:12) and increases with stel-
lar mass for M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5 M(cid:12), in excellent agreement with the
observed [α/Fe]∗- M∗ relation for early-type galaxies reported by
Thomas et al. (2010, black circles). This trend also agrees qualita-
tively with the observation from de La Rosa et al. (2011, triangles)
and Conroy et al. (2014, diamonds; here we only include their mea-
surements at M∗ > 1010 M(cid:12)). Note, however, that the normaliza-
tion of the simulated relation is uncertain by a factor of (cid:38) 2 due

from SN Type Ia is released, we infer that AGN must signiﬁcantly
suppress star formation within (cid:46) 1 Gyr.

Reproducing the observed relation between [α/Fe]∗ and stel-
lar mass (or, equivalently, stellar velocity dispersion) for early-type
galaxies has been a problem for many models of galaxy formation
(e.g. Nagashima et al. 2005; Pipino et al. 2009), although recently
a few semi-analytic models have been more successful (Arrigoni
et al. 2010; Yates et al. 2013). While it has been argued that a vari-
able IMF is necessary to reproduce the observed trend (Calura &
Menci 2009; Gargiulo et al. 2015), our results and those of Yates
et al. (2013) show that this can also be achieved with a universal
Chabrier IMF. Our model comparison shows that the inclusion of
AGN feedback is sufﬁcient to generate a sufﬁciently steep [α/Fe]∗-
M∗ relation. The effect of AGN feedback on this relation has been
demonstrated before, by Taylor & Kobayashi (2015) using low-
resolution hydrodynamical simulations, who ﬁnd an effect on two
example galaxies that is in qualitative agreement with our results.
However, in contrast to this work, the effect on the overall (mas-
sive) galaxy population is small, and their implementation of AGN
feedback does not reproduce the observed trend.

3.2 Relation with stellar age

If AGN feedback is the mechanism that quenches star formation in
galaxies, turning off AGN feedback should affect the ages of galax-
ies. Before comparing models with and without AGN feedback, we
ﬁrst show in the top pannel of Fig. 2 the relation between [α/Fe]∗
and age for the L = 100 cMpc simulation of the reference model.
Here, ‘age’ refers to the average stellar age, weighted by the ini-
tial mass of the stellar population (star particle), i.e. the mass at
the time it was formed. Galaxies with M∗ (cid:62) 1010 M(cid:12) are shown
as ﬁlled circles, where the colour indicates their stellar mass. For
clarity, galaxies with M∗ < 1010 M(cid:12) are shown as grey contours
depicting the 68th and 95th percentiles of the distribution.

The two mass regimes show opposite trends. For M∗ <
1010 M(cid:12), galaxies of increasing mean stellar age have lower
[α/Fe]∗. These galaxies are still forming stars, from gas that be-
comes increasingly Fe-enriched by SN Type Ia as time progresses.
Therefore, the oldest galaxies, which have had the longest time
to enrich their ISM and stars with Fe, have the lowest [α/Fe]∗.
Note that the negative trend between [α/Fe]∗ and mean stellar age
for low-mass galaxies, as well as the positive trend for high-mass
galaxies, is consistent with a positive correlation between age and
[α/Fe]∗ for individual stars within a galaxy. This is shown in Fig. 3
for three representative galaxies with M∗ ∼ 109 M(cid:12), 1010 M(cid:12),
1011 M(cid:12) from the L = 100 cMpc reference simulation. Star parti-
cles that are formed at earlier times, have higher [α/Fe]∗, since the
ISM at their formation time is less enriched by SN Type Ia than at
later times. The trends in Fig. 3 agree qualitatively with observa-
tions of stellar populations in the Milky Way (e.g. Haywood et al.
2013; Ramírez et al. 2013; Nissen 2015). A detailed, quantitative
comparison between EAGLE and stellar population measurements
from the APOGEE survey will be the subject of a future paper.
Galaxies with M∗ (cid:62) 1010 M(cid:12) (coloured circles in Fig.2)
show a transition from [α/Fe]∗ decreasing with age (M∗ (cid:46) 1010.5
M(cid:12)) to [α/Fe]∗ increasing with age (M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5 M(cid:12)). The
latter trend is consistent with the downsizing scenario for early-
type galaxies, in which older galaxies have formed the bulk of their
stars from a less Fe-enriched ISM, before their star formation was
quenched. The colour coding in Fig. 2 indicates that more massive
galaxies typically have higher ages and higher [α/Fe]∗ ratios, con-
sistent with the stellar mass trend shown in Fig.1.

Figure 1. The effect of AGN feedback on the α-element-to-iron abundance
ratio as a function of galaxy stellar mass for present-day central galaxies.
The curves show the median [α/Fe]∗ (represented by [O/Fe]∗) in log-
arithmic mass bins of size 0.2 dex, as predicted by the EAGLE simula-
tions with and without AGN feedback. The shaded regions mark the 10th
to 90th percentile range. We only show bins containing at least 10 galaxies
and corresponding to a stellar mass of at least 100 particles. In the ﬁdu-
cial model, [α/Fe]∗ increases with mass for M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5 M(cid:12), showing
excellent agreement with the observed relation from Thomas et al. (2010),
and in qualitative agreement with the trends observed by de La Rosa et al.
(2011) and Conroy et al. (2014) (all converted to a solar abundance ra-
tio of X O(cid:12) /X Fe(cid:12) = 4.44). In the model without AGN feedback, however,
[α/Fe]∗ is roughly constant over the whole mass range.

to uncertainties in the nucleosynthetic yields and SN Type Ia rate
(Wiersma et al. 2009b), while the normalization of the observed
relations varies as a result of uncertainties in the stellar population
modelling. The systematic uncertainty in the observed [α/Fe]∗ is
typically estimated to be ∼ 0.05− 0.1 dex (Thomas et al. 2010; de
La Rosa et al. 2011; Johansson et al. 2012; Conroy et al. 2014).

The reference model ran in the smaller volume (L = 50
cMpc) yields results consistent with the L = 100 cMpc simula-
tion. Comparing this model to the one without AGN feedback, we
ﬁnd that in the absence of AGN feedback [α/Fe]∗ does not increase
with stellar mass. The relation in fact exhibits a mildly negative gra-
dient. From this we infer that feedback from AGN, becoming effec-
tive at M∗ ∼ 1010.5 M(cid:12), is responsible for the α-enhancement
of present-day massive galaxies. It suppresses star formation in
the progenitor galaxies, when these progenitors and their central
BHs have grown massive enough for AGN feedback to be efﬁ-
cient, which happens earlier for more massive galaxies. Hence,
since most stars formed before AGN feedback became active, these
galaxies have earlier and shorter formation times, which naturally
leads to enhanced enrichment of the stellar phase by ejecta from
short-lived massive stars. In the absence of this quenching mech-
anism, on the other hand, late star formation is not suppressed ef-
ﬁciently enough to prevent the incorporation of iron from longer-
lived intermediate-mass stars (mainly SN Type Ia) into secondary
generations of stars. Considering the timescale on which the Fe

Figure 3. The relation between [α/Fe]∗ and age for individual star parti-
cles in 3 representative galaxies in the L = 100 cMpc EAGLE reference
simulation. The selected galaxies have stellar masses of M∗ ∼ 109 M(cid:12),
M∗ ∼ 1010 M(cid:12) and M∗ ∼ 1011 M(cid:12). The curves show the median
[α/Fe]∗ in each ∆age = 1 Gyr bin with at least 10 particles, while the
shaded region (for M∗ ∼ 1010 M(cid:12) only) marks the 10th to 90th per-
centile range. Irrespective of galaxy mass, the individual star particles show
a positive correlation between [α/Fe]∗ and age.

For early-type galaxies there are a number of observational
studies on ages and abundance ratios to compare with. The black
symbols in Fig. 2 show the observed [α/Fe]∗ (or [O/Fe]∗) as a
function of luminosity-weighted stellar age from Thomas et al.
(2010) (circles) and Conroy et al. (2014) (diamonds), and [α/Fe]∗
as a function of mass-weighted stellar age from de La Rosa et al.
(2011) (triangles). These correspond to the same mass bins as in
Fig. 1. We also show the observed relation between [O/Fe]∗ and
luminosity-weighted age from Johansson et al. (2012) (squares), by
evaluating their best-ﬁt relations at 6 stellar velocity dispersions be-
tween 101.9 km/s and 102.4 km/s (spaced by 0.1 dex). Note that the
systematic offsets between the different observed relations is large.
In addition to uncertainties in the stellar population modelling (sys-
tematic uncertainties in the stellar age are typically estimated to be
∼ 0.1 − 0.2 dex), this may be due to the size of the aperture used,
and the fact that luminosity-weighted ages are likely to yield lower
estimates of the population age than mass-weighted ages, as young
stars generally dominate the population luminosity (see e.g. Trager
& Somerville 2009). Comparing the observed relations to the rela-
tion predicted by EAGLE, we see that they all agree qualitatively
on the positive correlation between [α/Fe]∗ and age, as shown by
the M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5 M(cid:12) EAGLE galaxies (which are predominantly
early-type galaxies).

To illustrate the effect of AGN feedback on the ages of galax-
ies, we show in the bottom panel of Fig. 2 the relation between
[α/Fe]∗ and age for the L = 50 cMpc simulation without AGN
feedback. While the trend for M∗ (cid:46) 1010.5 M(cid:12) galaxies agrees
between the models with and without AGN, the increase in [α/Fe]∗
with age for M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5 M(cid:12) galaxies in the reference model is
absent in the model without AGN feedback. Instead, the high-mass

and mass-weighted mean stellar age. The top and bottom panels shows the
results from the EAGLE simulations with (L = 100 cMpc) and without

tribution for M∗ < 1010 M(cid:12) galaxies is shown as grey contours enclos-
ing the 68th and 95th percentiles. We only include galaxies with a stellar
mass corresponding to at least 100 particles. In both models, galaxies with
M∗ (cid:46) 1010.5 M(cid:12) have lower [α/Fe]∗ with increasing age, since they
increasingly enrich their ISM and stars with Fe as they continue to form
stars. In contrast, because star formation in galaxies with M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5
M(cid:12) is quenched by AGN, they are less Fe-enriched when they are older,
in qualitative agreement with observations of early-type galaxies (Thomas
et al. 2010; de La Rosa et al. 2011; Johansson et al. 2012; Conroy et al.
2014, all converted to a solar abundance ratio of X O(cid:12) /X Fe(cid:12) = 4.44). In the
absence of AGN feedback, however, the M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5 M(cid:12) galaxies follow
the trend of the lower-mass galaxies, decreasing their [α/Fe]∗ with time as
they continue to form stars.

This paper has been typeset from a TEX/LATEX ﬁle prepared by the author.

galaxies also show an inverted [α/Fe]∗- age relation, with its slope
and normalization similar to that of the low-mass population. We
conclude that AGN feedback causes the α-enhancement of massive
galaxies, as in the absence of this quenching mechanism the older
galaxies (which are still on average the more massive ones, since
they started to form stars earlier) have continued to form stars, and
hence to reduce their [α/Fe]∗, up to the present day.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the effect of AGN feedback on the stellar α-
enhancement of present-day central galaxies, using cosmological
simulations from the EAGLE project. We compared results from
the EAGLE ﬁducial model, which includes a subgrid implemen-
tation for energy feedback from AGN, to results from a model in
which AGN feedback has been turned off. We found that in the
presence of AGN feedback, the [α/Fe]∗ of M∗ (cid:38) 1010.5 M(cid:12)
galaxies increases with both increasing galaxy stellar mass and age.
These trends are in good agreement with observations of early-type
galaxies, and are consistent with galactic downsizing: the earlier
and more rapid formation timescales of massive galaxies result in
higher [α/Fe]∗, as the bulk of their stars was formed from a mostly
α-enriched ISM, before their star formation was quenched signif-
icantly. In the model without AGN feedback, however, [α/Fe]∗ of
galaxies is insensitive to stellar mass and decreases with increas-
ing mean stellar age, following the relation found for M∗ (cid:46) 1010.5
M(cid:12) galaxies, also by the model that includes AGN feedback. In the
absence of a quenching mechanism, galaxies continue to form stars
from an increasingly Fe-enriched ISM, decreasing their [α/Fe]∗ as
they age. We conclude that star formation quenching by AGN feed-
back can explain the observed α-enhancement of massive, early-
type galaxies.
