Abstract

Let G, H be ﬁnite groups and let X be a ﬁnite G-set. G-perfect nonlinear functions
from X to H have been studied in several papers. They have more interesting properties
than perfect nonlinear functions from G itself to H. By introducing the concept of a (G, H)-
related diﬀerence family of X, we obtain a characterization of G-perfect nonlinear functions
on X. When G is abelian, we characterize a G-diﬀerence set of X by the Fourier transform

on a normalized G-dual set bX. We will also investigate the existence and constructions of

G-perfect nonlinear functions and G-bent functions. Several known results in [2, 6, 10, 17] are
direct consequences of our results.

Introduction

Perfect nonlinear functions are actively studied by many researchers (cf. [4,6,7,9–11,13,14,16,17]).
They can be used to construct DES-like cryptosystems that are resistant to diﬀerential attacks. G-
perfect nonlinear functions have been studied in several papers. They are natural generalizations of
the classical perfect nonlinear functions with the XOR operations replaced by group actions, and
have more interesting properties. They can also be used to construct generalized DES-like cryp-
tosystems (where the XOR operation is replaced by a group action) that are resistant to modiﬁed
diﬀerential attacks. For a summary of the background on cryptosystems and group action modiﬁ-
cations, the reader is referred to [6]. Pott [14] mentioned that “It seems that in most applications
(in particular in cryptography) people use nonlinear functions on ﬁnite ﬁelds. However, there is
no technical reason why you should restrict yourselves to this case”.

In their original research on G-bent and G-perfect nonlinear functions on a G-set X, Poinsot
et al. [10, 12] characterize these functions by Fourier transforms of functions on G. Davis et al. [6]
characterize G-perfect nonlinear functions on a G-set X by G-diﬀerence sets of X, and construct
G-perfect nonlinear functions by constructing G-diﬀerence sets, without using Fourier transforms

at all. For a ﬁnite abelian group G and a G-set X, a G-dual set bX of X is introduced in [7], which
plays a role similar to the dual group bG. Then the Fourier transforms of functions on X are deﬁned
as functions on bX, and used to characterize G-bent and G-perfect nonlinear functions in [7].

In this paper we will ﬁrst give a characterization of G-perfect nonlinear functions on a G-set
X by (G, H)-related diﬀerence families of X (see Theorem 2.6). As applications of this charac-
terization, we obtain several known results in [2, 6, 17] as immediate consequences. When G is a
ﬁnite abelian group, we introduce the concept of a normalized G-dual set (see Deﬁnition 3.6), and
use it to characterize a G-diﬀerence set of X (see Theorem 4.3). Using the method developed in
this paper, we are able to give a very short and easy proof of an interesting result of Poinsot et
al. [10] (see Corollary 4.5). Furthermore, by applying the Fourier transforms on normalized G-dual
sets and the characterizations of G-perfect nonlinear functions established in [7], we investigate
the existence and constructions of G-perfect nonlinear functions and G-bent functions on X(see
Theorems 4.7, 5.4, 5.8, and 6.2). The methods developed in [7] and in this paper provide new
insights into the study of G-bent and G-perfect nonlinear functions.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the characterization of
G-perfect nonlinear functions by (G, H)-related diﬀerence families, and discuss its applications. In
Section 3, after the brief recall of some results in [7] that are needed later, we introduce the notion
of a normalized G-dual set, and study its basic properties. The characterization of G-diﬀerence
sets by normalized G-dual sets is given in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 are devoted to the study
of the existence and constructions of G-perfect nonlinear functions and G-bent functions for the
Klein four group G, respectively.

2 Perfect nonlinear functions and related deference families

In this section we introduce the concept of a (G, H)-related diﬀerence family (see Deﬁnition 2.4),
and use it to characterize G-perfect nonlinear functions (see Theorem 2.6). Applications of The-
orem 2.6 will also be discussed, and several known results in [2, 6, 17] are obtained as direct
consequences. Throughout the paper, the following notation will be used.

Notation 2.1. Let G be a ﬁnite group of order m, and X a ﬁnite G-set of cardinality v. That
is, there is a map G × X → X, (α, x) 7→ αx, such that for any x ∈ X, (αβ)x = α(βx) for all
α, β ∈ G, and 1Gx = x, where 1G is the identity element of G. Let H be a ﬁnite group.

For the fundamentals of group actions, the reader is referred to [1].
Let f : X → H be a function. For any α ∈ G the derivative of f in direction α, denoted by

f ′
α, is deﬁned by

f ′
α : X → H,

x 7→ f (αx)f (x)−1.

The cardinality of a set S is denoted by |S|. As usual (cf. [6, 10]), the function f is said to be
G-perfect nonlinear if |H| divides |X| and

α

(cid:12)(cid:12)f ′

−1(σ)(cid:12)(cid:12) = |X|

|H|

,

∀ α ∈ G \ {1G} ∀ σ ∈ H,

(2.1)

where f ′
α

−1(σ) := {x ∈ X : f ′

α(x) = σ} is the inverse image of σ in X.

As generalizations of the usual diﬀerence sets and the relative diﬀerence sets of groups, Davis et
al. [6] introduced the following deﬁnition. Note that G×H acts on X×H by (α, σ)(x, h) = (αx, σh),
where (α, σ) ∈ G × H and (x, h) ∈ X × H.
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Cf. [6, Deﬁnition 3.2]).

(i) A subset D of cardinality k of X is called a G–
(v, k, ℓ) diﬀerence set of X if for any α ∈ G \ {1G} , there are exactly ℓ elements (x1, x2) of
D × D such that αx1 = x2.

2

(cid:12)(cid:12){(x, y) ∈ C × D : αx = y}(cid:12)(cid:12) = |αC ∩ D|,

(2.2)

(ii) A subset R of cardinality k of X × H is called a G × H–(v,|H|, k, ℓ)-relative diﬀerence set
of X × H relative to {1G} × H if (i) for every (α, σ) ∈ (G × H) \ ({1G} × H) there are
(x, h), (x, h′) ∈ R, then h = h′. Such a G × H–(v,|H|, k, ℓ)-relative diﬀerence set is said to
be semiregular if v = k.

exactly ℓ elements(cid:0)(x1, h1), (x2, h2)(cid:1) ∈ R × R such that (α, σ)(x1, h1) = (x2, h2) and (ii) if

Davis et al. [6] characterized G-perfect nonlinear functions from X to H by G-diﬀerence sets
(when |H| = 2, see Corollary 2.10 below) and by semiregular relative diﬀerence sets (see Corollary
2.8 below).

Note that for any α ∈ G and subsets C, D of the G-set X,

where αC := {αx : x ∈ C}. Thus, a subset D of cardinality k of X is a G–(v, k, ℓ) diﬀerence set
if and only if |αD ∩ D| = ℓ for all α ∈ G \ {1G}. Since any α ∈ G induces a permutation on X,
we have
(2.3)
In particular, |αD∩D| = |α−1D∩D|, for any α ∈ G. Let D′ := X\D. Then (αD∩D)∪(αD∩D′) =
αD ∩ (D ∪ D′) = αD ∩ X = αD. So D and D′ disjoint implies that

|αC ∩ D| = |α−1(αC ∩ D)| = |C ∩ α−1D|.

Now it follows from Eqn (2.4) and Eqn (2.3) that

|αD ∩ D| + |αD ∩ D′| = |D|.

|αD ∩ D′| = |D| − |αD ∩ D| = |D| − |α−1D ∩ D| = |α−1D ∩ D′| = |D ∩ αD′|.

That is,

|αD ∩ D′| = |D ∩ αD′|,

∀ α ∈ G, where D′ = X \ D.

(2.4)

(2.5)

Lemma 2.3. Let D be a subset of cardinality k of the G-set X, and D′ := X \ D with cardinality
k′ := v − k. Then the following are equivalent.
(i) There is a nonnegative integer w such that |αD ∩ D′| = w (or equivalently, |D ∩ αD′| = w)

for all α ∈ G \ {1G}.

(ii) D is a G–(v, k, k − w) diﬀerence set.
(iii) D′ is a G–(v, k′, k′ − w) diﬀerence set.
Proof. By Eqn (2.4), for all α ∈ G \ {1G}, |αD ∩ D′| = w if and only if |αD ∩ D| = k − w. So (i)
and (ii) are equivalent. Similarly, (i) and (iii) are also equivalent.

Xu [17] introduced the concept of a (G, H)-related diﬀerence family of a group G (which is
diﬀerent from the diﬀerence families deﬁned in [3]) and used it to characterize G-perfect nonlinear
functions on groups. We generalize this concept to G-sets as follows.

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let Sh ⊆ X for h ∈ H be disjoint subsets indexed by H such thatSh∈H Sh = X.
We say that {Sh : h ∈ H} is a (G, H)-related diﬀerence family of X if for any α ∈ G \ {1G} and
σ ∈ H \ {1H} there are exactly |X|

|H| elements (x, y) ∈Sh∈H(Sh × Sσh) such that αx = y.

|H|

Note that if there exits a (G, H)-related diﬀerence family of X, then |H| divides |X|. Also in

the above deﬁnition, we do not assume that Sh is nonempty for every h ∈ H.

following are equivalent.

(i) {Sh : h ∈ H} is a (G, H)-related diﬀerence family.

for all α ∈ G \ {1G} and σ ∈ H \ {1H}.
for all α ∈ G \ {1G} and all σ ∈ H.

Lemma 2.5. Let Sh ⊆ X for h ∈ H be disjoint subsets such that Sh∈H Sh = X. Then the
(ii) Ph∈H(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12) = |X|
(iii) Ph∈H(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12) = |X|
elements (x, y) ∈Sh∈H(Sh × Sσh) such that αx = y is equal toPh∈H(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12). Thus, (i) and
(ii) are equivalent. Furthermore, sinceSh∈H Sh = X,
(αSh ∩ Sσh) = αSh\(cid:16) [σ∈H
Hence, Sσh disjoint for all σ ∈ H imply thatPσ∈H(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12) = |Sh|. Therefore,

Proof. It follows from Sh ⊆ X disjoint for all h ∈ H that for any α ∈ G, αSh∩ Sσh are also disjoint
for all h, σ ∈ H, and Sh × Sσh are disjoint for all h, σ ∈ H, too. So by Eqn (2.2), the number of

[σ∈H

|H|

Xσ∈HXh∈H(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12) = |X|.

So (ii) and (iii) are equivalent.
Theorem 2.6. Let f : X → H be a function, and Sh := f −1(h) for all h ∈ H. Then f is a
G-perfect nonlinear function if and only if {Sh : h ∈ H} is a (G, H)-related diﬀerence family.

Proof. Clearly the subsets Sh of X are disjoint for all h ∈ H, andSh∈H Sh = X. Let α ∈ G\{1G}

and σ, h ∈ H. Then for any x ∈ X,

x ∈ f ′

−1(σ) ∩ Sh ⇐⇒ f (αx)f (x)−1 = σ and f (x) = h

⇐⇒ f (αx) = σf (x) = σh ⇐⇒ αx ∈ αSh ∩ Sσh.

−1(σ) ∩ Sh(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12), for any α ∈ G \ {1G} and σ, h ∈ H. Hence,
Thus,(cid:12)(cid:12)f ′

∀ α ∈ G \ {1G}, ∀ σ ∈ H.

By the deﬁnition of a G-perfect nonlinear function (cf. Eqn (2.1)) and Lemma 2.5, the theorem
holds.

As direct consequences, we have the following corollaries.

Corollary 2.7 (Cf. [17], Theorem 1.3). Let f : G → H be a function, and Sh := f −1(h), for any
h ∈ H. Then the following are equivalent.

(i) f is perfect nonlinear.

(ii) {Sh : h ∈ H} is a (G, H)-related diﬀerence family.

let Rf = (cid:8)(cid:0)x, f (x)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) x ∈ X(cid:9) ⊆ X × H. Then f is G-perfect nonlinear if and only if Rf is a

Corollary 2.8 (Cf. [2, Theorem 14], [6, Theorem 3.4]). Let f : X → H be a function, and
G × H–(|X|,|H|,|X|, |X|
Proof. Let Sh := f −1(h) ⊆ X for h ∈ H, and let α ∈ G \ {1G} and σ ∈ H. Then for any

|H| ) semiregular relative diﬀerence set of X × H relative to {1G} × H.

(y, f (y)) ∈ (α, σ)Rf ∩ Rf ⇐⇒ (y, f (y)) = (αx, σf (x)) for some (unique) x ∈ X

⇐⇒ y ∈ αSh ∩ Sσh for some (unique) h ∈ H.

Thus,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(α, σ)Rf ∩ Rf(cid:12)(cid:12) =Xh∈H(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12),

∀α ∈ G \ {1G} ∀ σ ∈ H.

So the corollary holds by Eqn (2.2), Lemma 2.5, and Theorem 2.6.

If for any α ∈ G \ {1G}, there are exactly ℓ elements (x, y) in Sp

The diﬀerence families of groups in [3] can be generalized to G-diﬀerence families of G-sets as
follows. Let F := {S1, . . . , Sp} be a family of nonempty subsets of X, and K := {|Si| : 1 ≤ i ≤ p}.
i=1(Si × Si) such that αx = y,
then F is called a G–(v, K, ℓ) diﬀerence family of X. Furthermore, if F forms a partition of X,
then F is called a partitioned G–(v, K, ℓ) diﬀerence family of X. As an immediate consequence of
Theorem 2.6, we have the following
Corollary 2.9. Let f : X → H be a G-perfect nonlinear function. Let Sh := f −1(h) for any
h ∈ H, and K := {|Sh| : h ∈ f (X)}, where f (X) denotes the image of f . Then {Sh : h ∈ f (X)}
is a partitioned G–(|X|, K,|X|/|H|) diﬀerence family in X.

The relation between G-perfect nonlinear functions and G-diﬀerence sets established in [6] can

also be easily obtained as a direct consequence of Theorem 2.6 and Lemma 2.3.

Corollary 2.10 (Cf. [6], Theorem 3.3). Let f : X → F2 be a function, where F2 denotes the ﬁeld of
2 elements (but here it is regarded as an additive group of order 2). Let S0 = f −1(0), S1 = f −1(1),
k0 = |S0|, and k1 = |S1| (hence k0 + k1 = v). Then f is a G-perfect nonlinear function if and
4 ) diﬀerence set (or equivalently, S0 is a G–(v, k0, k0 − v
only if 4|v and S1 is a G–(v, k1, k1 − v
4 )
diﬀerence set).

Proof. By Theorem 2.6, f is G-perfect nonlinear if and only if

|αS0 ∩ S1| + |αS1 ∩ S0| = |X|
|F2|

=

v

∀ α ∈ G \ {1G}.

By Eqn (2.5), the above equality is equivalent to that

|αS0 ∩ S1| = |S0 ∩ αS1| =

v
4

,

∀ α ∈ G \ {1G}.

Thus the corollary follows from Lemma 2.3 immediately.

Moreover, by applying Theorem 2.6 and Lemma 2.3, in the next theorem we can determine
all G-perfect nonlinear functions on a G-set whose images contain exactly two elements. Note
that examples of G-perfect nonlinear functions that satisfy the properties described in the next
theorem can be found in [6] and [7, Example 6.5].

If h 6= h1, h2, then αSh = ∅, and hence(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh ∩ Sσh(cid:12)(cid:12) = 0. So the above equality can be reduced to

(2.6)

(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh1 ∩ Sσh1(cid:12)(cid:12) +(cid:12)(cid:12)αSh2 ∩ Sσh2(cid:12)(cid:12) = |X|

Theorem 2.11. Assume that f : X → H is a function whose image f (X) consists of exactly
two elements h1, h2 ∈ H. Let Sh := f −1(h) for h ∈ H, and ki := |Shi| for i = 1, 2. Then f is a
G-perfect nonlinear function if and only if one of the following holds.

(i) |H| = 2, 4|v and Sh1 is a G–(v, k1, k1 − v/4) diﬀerence set (or equivalently, Sh2 is a G–

(v, k2, k2 − v/4) diﬀerence set).

(ii) |H| = 3, 3|v and Sh1 is a G–(v, k1, k1 − v/3) diﬀerence set (or equivalently, Sh2 is a G–

Proof. Note that both k1 and k2 are positive, but |Sh| = 0 (i.e. Sh = ∅) for h 6= h1, h2.

Conversely, if (i) holds, then f is a G-perfect nonlinear function by Corollary 2.10. If (ii) holds,

then by Lemma 2.3, Eqn (2.7) holds. Thus, f is a G-perfect nonlinear function by Theorem 2.6.

3 Normalized G-dual sets

With Notation 2.1, in the rest of the paper we always assume that G and H are abelian. Then we
study G-perfect nonlinear functions, G-bent functions, and G-diﬀerence sets, etc. by using Fourier
transforms on G-sets.

In this section we ﬁrst brieﬂy state some known results that will be needed later. Then we
introduce the concept of a normalized G-dual set and discuss its basic properties. For bent and
perfect nonlinear functions on ﬁnite groups, the reader is referred to [4, 5, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16–19].

Let bG be the dual group of G. That is, bG is the group of irreducible characters of G over the

complex ﬁeld C. The principal irreducible character of G is the character ψ0 : G → C, α 7→ 1. The

theory of ﬁnite groups, the reader is referred to [8, 15].

Let CX be the set of all functions from X to C. Then CX is a G-space with the G-action

deﬁned by

(αf )(x) := f (α−1x),

For any f ∈ CX, if there is a ψ ∈ bG such that

f (α−1x) = ψ(α)f (x),

for any f ∈ CX, α ∈ G, x ∈ X.

for any α ∈ G, x ∈ X,

then f is said to be ψ-linear or G-linear (cf. [7, Deﬁnition 2.1]). Also CX is a unitary space with
inner product

hf, gi :=Xx∈X

f (x)g(x),

for any f, g ∈ CX .

For a positive real number µ, a basis {u1, . . . , uv} of CX is called a µ-normal orthogonal basis if
hui, uji = δijµ for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ v, where δij is the Kronecker delta. The complex conjugate of
f ∈ CX is f ∈ CX deﬁned by f (x) := f (x), for any x ∈ X.

Deﬁnition 3.1. (Cf. [7, Deﬁnition 2.2]) A G-dual set bX of a G-set X is a |X|-normal orthogonal
basis of CX such that any λ ∈ bX is G-linear and bX is closed under complex conjugate (i.e. λ ∈ bX
for any λ ∈ bX).
For any G-set X, there exists a G-dual set bX by [7, Theorem 2.3]. Let bX be a G-dual set
of X. For any ψ ∈ bG, let bXψ := {λ ∈ bX : λ is ψ-linear}. Then bXψ are disjoint for all ψ ∈ bG and
bX =Sψ∈ bG bXψ.
Deﬁnition 3.2. (Cf. [7, Deﬁnition 3.1]) For any f ∈ CX, the Fourier transform of f on bX is a
function bf ∈ C bX deﬁned by

f (x)λ(x),

bf (λ) =Xx∈X

for any λ ∈ bX.

Let T := {z ∈ C : |z| = 1} be the unit circle in C. A function f : X → T is called a G-bent

function (cf. [7, Deﬁnition 4.1]) if

Xλ∈ bXψ(cid:12)(cid:12)bf (λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 = |X|2

for all ψ ∈ bG.

SincePψ∈ bGPλ∈ bXψ |bf (λ)|2 = |bf|2 = |X|2 (see [7, Corollary 3.5]), it follows that

(i) For any λ ∈ bX, there is exactly one orbit Xj such that λ(Xj) 6= {0}.
(ii) If λ ∈ bX and λ(Xj) 6= {0} for some orbit Xj, then for any x ∈ Xj, |λ(x)| =p|X|/|Xj|.
(iii) For any non-principal irreducible character ψ of G and any λ ∈ bXψ, λ(X)+ = 0.
(iv) For any Xj and any ψ ∈ bG, there is at most one λ ∈ bXψ such that λ(Xj) 6= {0}.
(v) For any ψ ∈ bG, there is λ ∈ bXψ such that λ(Xj) 6= {0} for some Xj if and only if Nj ⊆ ker ψ.
(vi) For any Xj, there is exactly one λ ∈ bXψ0 such that λ(Xj) 6= {0} (hence λ(x) =p|X|/|Xj|
Proof. For any 1 ≤ j ≤ p, let bGj := {ψ ∈ bG : ker ψ ⊇ Nj}. Then bGj is a subgroup of bG and is
isomorphic to the dual group \G/Nj of the quotient group G/Nj. Fix xj0 ∈ Xj. For any ψ ∈ bGj,

for any ψ ∈ bGj. Thus, λjψ is well deﬁned. It is clear that λjψ is ψ-linear. For any ψ, ϕ ∈ bGj, the

4 G-diﬀerence sets

As in Section 3, we assume that both G and H are abelian. In this section we ﬁrst study charac-

relations between G-diﬀerence sets and G-perfect nonlinear functions by the Fourier transforms

terizations of G-diﬀerence sets of X via a normalized G-dual set bX of X. Then we describe the
on bX. As direct consequences, we will obtain some known results in [6, 10].

Lemma 4.1. Let D be a nonempty subset of X. Then D is a G–(v, k, ℓ) diﬀerence set of X if and
only if

The next lemma is straightforward.

X(x,y)∈D×D

G+
x,y = k · 1G + ℓ(G \ {1G})+ = (k − ℓ)1G + ℓG+,

where Gx,y is the same as in Eqn (3.3).

For any subsets C, D of X, let

δ(C, D) := X(x,y)∈C×D

|Gx,y|.

(4.1)

It is clear that δ(C, D) = δ(D, C). Note that for any x ∈ X,Py∈X|Gx,y| = |G|. Hence δ(C, X) =

|C| · |G|. If D is a G–(v, k, ℓ) diﬀerence set, then δ(D, D) = k + ℓ(|G| − 1) by Lemma 4.1, and
δ(D, X \ D) = δ(D, X) − δ(D, D) = (k − ℓ)(|G| − 1).
The next lemma is known but does not appear in the standard references in the representation
theory of ﬁnite groups. We need this result in this section and the next section.
Lemma 4.2. Let a ∈ CG and γ, µ ∈ C. Then the following hold.

We have a characterization of G-diﬀerence sets in terms of G-dual sets.

(i) a = µ · 1G + γG+ if and only if for any non-principal ψ ∈ bG, ψ(a) = µ.
(ii) a = µ · 1G if and only if for all ψ ∈ bG, ψ(a) = µ.
Theorem 4.3. Let bX be a normalized G-dual set. Then a nonempty subset D of X is a G–(v, k, ℓ)
diﬀerence set of X if and only if for any non-principal ψ ∈ bG,

x,y(cid:17)
principal ψ ∈ bG, Eqn (4.2) holds. Then ψ(cid:16)P(x,y)∈D×D G+

Let X1, . . . , Xp be the orbits of the action of G on X. Let D be a G-diﬀerence set of X,

Since 1G ∈ Gx,x for any x ∈ X, comparing the coeﬃcient of 1G in both sides of the above equality,
x,y = k · 1G + ℓ(G\ {1G})+. So D is a G–(v, k, ℓ) diﬀerence set
by Lemma 4.1.

we see that γ = ℓ andP(x,y)∈D×D G+
Ci = D ∩ Xi or Xi \ (D ∩ Xi), 1 ≤ i ≤ p, and C = Sp
i=1 Ci. Let bX be a normalized G-dual
set of X. Then for any non-principal ψ ∈ bG and λ ∈ bXψ, since there is only one orbit Xj

such that λ(Xj) 6= {0} and λ(Xj)+ = 0 by Lemma 3.5, we see that λ(D)+ = λ(D ∩ Xj)+ =
−λ(Xj \ (D ∩ Xj))+ = ±λ(Cj)+ = ±λ(C)+. Hence, C is also a G-diﬀerence set by Theorem 4.3.
A result similar to this observation for arbitrary ﬁnite groups was proved in [6, Theorem 4.3].
From Theorems 3.4 and 2.11 (or Corollary 2.10), we have the following corollary immediately.

G-dual set of X, and f : X → F2 a function. Then f −1(1) is a G–(v, k, k − v/4) diﬀerence

Corollary 4.4. Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group acting on a ﬁnite set X. Let bX be a normalized
set if and only if for any non-principal ψ ∈ bG and non-principal irreducible character ξ of F2,
Pλ∈ bXψ(cid:12)(cid:12) \(ξ ◦ f )(λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 = |X|2/|G|.

The method developed in this section is useful in other places. For example, we can easily

prove the following

Corollary 4.5. (Cf. [10, Theorem 6]) Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group acting regularly on a set
X, and f : X → F2 a function. Then f is G-perfect nonlinear if and only if f −1(1) is a G–
(4u2, 2u2 ± u, u(u ± 1)) diﬀerence set of X, where |X| = 4u2.
Proof. Let S1 := f −1(1), v := |X|, and k := |S1|. Since G acts regularly on X, we have |G| = |X| =
v, and δ(S1, S1) = |S1|2 = k2. If f is G-perfect nonlinear, then S1 is a G–(v, k, k − v/4) diﬀerence
set of X, and hence δ(S1, S1) = k + (k−v/4)(v−1) by Lemma 4.1. Thus, k2 = k + (k−v/4)(v−1),
and k = (v ± √v)/2. But 4|v implies that ±√v/2 = k − v/2 must be an integer. Let u = √v/2.
Then v = 4u2, k = 2u2 ± u, k − v/4 = u(u ± 1), and S1 is a G–(4u2, 2u2 ± u, u(u ± 1)) diﬀerence
set. The other direction is clear.

Remark 4.6. Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group acting on a ﬁnite set X, and let f : X → F2 be
a G-perfect nonlinear function. If the action of G on X is not regular, then it is not necessarily
|X| = 4u2 for some positive integer u. The next theorem gives such an example. Also see Section
5 for more such examples.

Theorem 4.7. Let G be a group of order 2 acting on a ﬁnite set X. Assume that the orbits of G
are X1, . . . , Xr, Xr+1, . . . , Xr+s such that the length of each Xi is 2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ r, and the length
of each Xj is 1 for r + 1 ≤ j ≤ r + s. Then the following hold.

(i) There is a G-perfect nonlinear function X → F2 if and only if 2r ≥ s and 4|(2r + s).
(ii) Assume that 2r ≥ s and 4|(2r + s). Then a function f : X → F2 is G-perfect nonlinear if

and only if

(cid:12)(cid:12){i : 1 ≤ i ≤ r and |Xi ∩ f −1(1)| = 1}(cid:12)(cid:12) =

Proof. Let bG = {ψ0, ψ1}, where ψ0 is the principal irreducible character. Let bX = {λi

: 1 ≤
i ≤ r + s} ∪ {ηj
:
1 ≤ j ≤ r}. Then for 1 ≤ j ≤ r, ηj can be chosen such that the support of ηj is Xj, and

: 1 ≤ j ≤ r} be a normalized G-dual set of X such that bXψ1 = {ηj

11

ηj(xj) = p(2r + s)/2, ηj(yj) = −p(2r + s)/2, where {xj, yj} = Xj. Let f : X → F2 be a

function, and ξ the non-principal irreducible character of F2. Then

\(ξ ◦ f )(ηj) = ξ(f (xj))ηj(xj) + ξ(f (yj))ηj(yj) =(±2p(2r + s)/2,

if |Xj ∩ f −1(1)| = 1;
otherwise.

Thus,

rXj=1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) \(ξ ◦ f )(ηj)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where p =(cid:12)(cid:12){j : 1 ≤ j ≤ r and |Xj ∩ f −1(1)| = 1}(cid:12)(cid:12). So by Theorem 3.4, f is G-perfect nonlinear

if and only if p = (2r + s)/4 ≤ r, and the theorem holds.

When s = 2r in the above theorem, we have the following

Corollary 4.8. (Cf. [6, Theorem 4.4]) Let m be a positive integer, and let X and Y be two sets
such that |X| = |Y | = 2m and X ∩ Y = ∅. Let π be a permutation on X ∪ Y such that π(x) = x
for all x ∈ X, π(y) 6= y, and π(π(y)) = y, for all y ∈ Y . Then there is a hπi-perfect nonlinear
function f : X ∪ Y → F2. Furthermore, f can be chosen to be evenly-balanced and hence f −1(1)
is a hπi–(4m, 2m, m) diﬀerence set of X ∪ Y .

5 Perfect nonlinear functions on actions of Klein group

In this section we assume that G := {1G, α, β, γ} is the Klein group, and study necessary and
suﬃcient conditions under which there exist G-perfect nonlinear functions on G-sets. Constructions
of G-perfect nonlinear functions are also presented. Note that α2 = β2 = γ2 = 1G, αβ = γ, βγ =

Theorem 5.4. With the notation in Notation 5.1 and Eqn (5.2), if s = 0, then the following hold.

(i) There exists a G-perfect nonlinear function from X to F2 if and only if 8 divides |X| and

min{p, q, r} ≥ |X|/8.

(ii) A function f : X → F2 is G-perfect nonlinear if and only if µα = µβ = µγ = |X|/8.

be the normalized G-dual set of X given by Eqn (5.1). Then by Lemma 5.3,

Proof. Let f : X → F2 be a function, and ξ the non-principal irreducible character of F2. Let bX
Xη1i∈ bXψ1(cid:12)(cid:12) \(ξ ◦ f )(η1i)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 = 2|X|µα, Xη2i∈ bXψ2(cid:12)(cid:12) \(ξ ◦ f )(η2i)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 = 2|X|µβ, Xη3i∈ bXψ3(cid:12)(cid:12) \(ξ ◦ f )(η3i)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 = 2|X|µγ.

Since s = 0, Theorem 3.4 and Eqn (5.1) imply that f is G-perfect nonlinear if and only if
µα = µβ = µγ = |X|/8. So (ii) holds.
Now we prove (i). First assume that there is a G-perfect nonlinear function f : X → F2. Then
by (ii), 8 divides |X|. Furthermore, since p ≥ µα, q ≥ µβ, and r ≥ µγ, it also follows from (ii) that
min{p, q, r} ≥ |X|/8. On the other hand, if 8 divides |X| and min{p, q, r} ≥ |X|/8, then it is clear
that there exists a function f : X → F2 such that µα = µβ = µγ = |X|/8. Hence, f is G-perfect
nonlinear by (ii), and (i) holds.

From the proof of Theorem 5.4, we have the following corollary by Theorem 4.3.

Corollary 5.5. With the notation in Notation 5.1 and Eqn (5.2), let f : X → F2 be a function.
If s = 0, then f −1(1) is a G-diﬀerence set of X if and only if µα = µβ = µγ.

In general when s 6= 0, the classiﬁcation of G-perfect nonlinear functions from X to F2 is much

more complicated. The next example gives the classiﬁcation for |X| = 16.
Example 5.6. With the notation in Notation 5.1, let f : X → F2 be a G-perfect nonlinear
function. Assume that |X| = 16. Then one of the following hold.

(i) s = 4, and either the restriction of f to each Xi is G-perfect nonlinear or by renumbering

Xi if necessary, f is constant on X4 and ψi-split on Xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3.

(ii) s = 3, and by renumbering Xi if necessary, f is ψi-split on Xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, and f is constant

on other orbits of G.

(iii) s = 3, p = 2, and by renumbering Xi if necessary, f is constant on X1 and ψi-split on Xi for

i = 2, 3, and µα = 2.

Similar results for cases s = 3, q = 2 and s = 3, r = 2 also hold.

(iv) s = 2, and the restrictions of f to X1, X2, and X \ (X1 ∪ X2) are all G-perfect nonlinear.

(v) s = 2, q = r = 2, and by renumbering X1, X2 if necessary, f is ψ1-split on X1 and constant

on X2, and µβ = µγ = 2.

Similar results for cases s = 2, p = q = 2 and s = 2, p = r = 2 also hold.

X2, and µα = 2, µβ = µγ = 0.
Similar results for cases s = 2, q ≥ 2 and s = 2, r ≥ 2 also hold.

(vii) s = 1, min{p, q} ≥ 2, f is ψ3-split on X1, µα = µβ = 2, and µγ = 0.

Similar results for cases s = 1, min{p, r} ≥ 2 and s = 1, min{q, r} ≥ 2 also hold.

(viii) s = 1, p = q = r = 2, f is constant on X1, and µα = µβ = µγ = 2.

Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X. A nonempty subset Y of X is said to be

G-stable if Y is the union of orbits of G. The next lemma is straightforward.

Lemma 5.7. Let G be a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁnite set X, and let Y, Z be G-stable subsets of
X such that Y ∪ Z = X. Let H be a ﬁnite group, and f : X → H a function. Then the following
hold.

(i) If the restrictions of f to both Y and Z are G-perfect nonlinear, then f is G-perfect nonlinear.

(ii) If f and the restriction of f to Y are G-perfect nonlinear, then the restrictions of f to Z is

also G-perfect nonlinear.

Theorem 5.8. With the notation in Notation 5.1, there exists a G-perfect nonlinear function from
X to F2 if and only if one of the following hold:

(i) There exists a G-perfect nonlinear function from X \ (X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xs) to F2; or
(ii) 4|v0, where v0 = 2p + 2q + 2r + t, and there are nonnegative integers k0, p1, q1, r1 such that

p1 ≤ p, q1 ≤ q, r1 ≤ r, and

Proof. First assume that there exists a G-perfect nonlinear function from X to F2. Then we prove
that (i) or (ii) holds. If (i) holds, there is nothing to prove. Assume that (i) does not hold. Then
there is a minimal number of subsets among X1, . . . , Xs, say X1, . . . , Xs1, such that there exists a
G-perfect nonlinear function f : X0 ∪ X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xs1 → F2, where X0 = X \ (X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xs), and
1 ≤ s1 ≤ s. Then by Lemma 5.7, the choice of the minimal number of the subsets Xi implies that
the restriction of f to any Xi is not G-perfect nonlinear, 1 ≤ i ≤ s1. Thus, for any 1 ≤ i ≤ s1, f
is either constant or ψj-split on Xi for some 1 ≤ j ≤ 3.
the subsets X1, . . . , Xs1, assume that there are k0 subsets on which f is constant, and ki subsets

Let Y = X0 ∪ X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xs1, and bY a normalized G-dual set of Y given by Eqn (5.1). Among

on which f is ψi-split, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Also let p1 := µα, q1 := µβ, and r1 := µγ, where µα, µβ, µγ are
deﬁned by Eqn (5.2). Then by Lemma 5.3 and Theorem 3.4,

|Y |2
4

= Xλ∈ bYψ1(cid:12)(cid:12) \(ξ ◦ f )(λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 = (4k1 + 2p1)|Y |,

where ξ is the non-principal irreducible character of F2. Thus, 4k1 + 2p1 = |Y |/4. Similarly,
4k2 + 2q1 = 4k3 + 2r1 = |Y |/4. Thus, 4(k1 + k2 + k3) + 2(p1 + q1 + r1) = 3|Y |/4. Since |Y | = 4s1 + v0
and s1 = k0 + k1 + k2 + k3, we get that

s1 =

3v0
4

+ 4k0 − 2(p1 + q1 + r1).

(5.3)

Also it follows from 4k1 + 2p1 = 4k2 + 2q1 = 4k3 + 2r1 = |Y |/4 that p1 ≡ q1 ≡ r1 mod 2.
Furthermore, |Y | = 4s1 + v0 = 4v0 + 16k0 − 8(p1 + q1 + r1) by Eqn (5.3). So 4k1 + 2p1 = |Y |/4
yields that

k1 =

≥ 0.

Similarly, k2 = v0/4 + k0 − q1 − (p1 + r1)/2 ≥ 0, and k3 = v0/4 + k0 − r1 − (p1 + q1)/2 ≥ 0. So (ii)
holds.
On the other hand, if (i) holds, then clearly there is a G-perfect nonlinear function from
X to F2 by Lemma 5.7. Now assume that (ii) holds. Let k1 = v0/4 + k0 − p1 − (q1 + r1)/2,
k2 = v0/4 + k0 − q1 − (p1 + r1)/2, and k3 = v0/4 + k0 − r1 − (p1 + q1)/2. Then k1, k2, and k3 are
nonnegative integers, and

k0 + k1 + k2 + k3 =

3v0
4

+ 4k0 − 2(p1 + q1 + r1) ≤ s.

Let f : X → F2 be a function that satisﬁes the following conditions: µα = p1, µβ = q1, µγ = r1;
among the subsets X1, . . . , Xs1, where s1 := k0+k1+k2+k3, f is constant on k0 subsets and ψi-split

on ki subsets, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, and(cid:12)(cid:12)f −1(1) ∩ Xj(cid:12)(cid:12) = 1 or 3 for s1 < j ≤ s. Let Y = X0 ∪ X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xs1,

where X0 = X \ (X1 ∪ · · · ∪ Xs). Then by Lemma 5.3 and Theorem 3.4, it is easy to show that
the restriction of f to Y is G-perfect nonlinear. Since the restriction of f to each Xj is G-perfect
nonlinear, s1 < j ≤ s, f is a G-perfect nonlinear function from X to F2 by Lemma 5.7.

6 Bent functions on actions of Klein group

In this section we study G-bent functions for the Klein group G. Our main result is Theorem 6.2
below. We will prove this theorem by constructing the desired G-bent functions. Note that if there
is a G-perfect nonlinear function from X to a ﬁnite abelian group, then there exists a G-bent
function on X by Theorem 3.4. However, in this section we will construct the G-bent functions
directly. These functions cannot be obtained from the G-perfect nonlinear functions constructed
in the previous section.

Notation 6.1. Let G be the Klein four group acting on a ﬁnite set X with orbits

Xα,1, . . . , Xα,p, Xβ,1, . . . , Xβ,q, Xγ,1, . . . , Xγ,r

such that the length of each orbit is 2, α ﬁxes every point in Xα,1, . . . , Xα,p, β ﬁxes every point
in Xβ,1, . . . , Xβ,q, and γ ﬁxes every point in Xγ,1, . . . , Xγ,r. Also let Xα,i = {xi, yi}, 1 ≤ i ≤ p,
Xβ,i = {xp+i, yp+i}, 1 ≤ i ≤ q, and Xγ,i = {xp+q+i, yp+q+i}, 1 ≤ i ≤ r. However, we do not assume
that p, q, r are all nonzero.

Theorem 6.2. With the notation in Notation 6.1, there exist (inﬁnitely many) bent functions on
X if and only if

p + q + r ≤ 4 min{p, q, r}.

(6.1)

In order to prove Theorem 6.2, we need a few lemmas ﬁrst. In the following we always assume

where λij and ηij are deﬁned as follows. The supports of λ1i and η1i are Xα,i, λ1i(xi) = λ1i(yi) =

that G is the Klein four group whose dual group bG is given by Table 5.1. With the notation in
Notation 6.1, we can choose a normalized G-dual set bX of X such that
bXψ0 := {λ11, . . . , λ1p, λ21, . . . , λ2q, λ31, . . . , λ3r},

bXψ1 := { η11, . . . , η1p}, bXψ2 := {η21, . . . , η2q}, bXψ3 := {η31, . . . , η3r},

p|X|/2, and η1i(xi) = −η1i(yi) = p|X|/2, 1 ≤ i ≤ p; the supports of λ2i and η2i are Xβ,i,
λ2i(xp+i) = λ2i(yp+i) =p|X|/2, and η2i(xp+i) = −η2i(yp+i) =p|X|/2, 1 ≤ i ≤ q; and the sup-
ports of λ3i and η3i are Xγ,i, λ3i(xp+q+i) = λ3i(yp+q+i) =p|X|/2, and η3i(xp+q+i) = −η3i(yp+q+i) =
p|X|/2, 1 ≤ i ≤ r.

The next lemma generalizes [7, Example 6.3].

(6.2)

Lemma 6.3. With the notation in Notation 6.1, if |X| = 6 and p = q = r = 1, then there are
inﬁnitely many G-bent functions on X.
Proof. Let f : X → T be a function, and ci := f (xi), di := f (yi), 1 ≤ i ≤ 3. Then by Eqn (6.2),

= 3|c1 − d1|2 = 6 − 3(c1d1 + c1d1).

2

Now assume that f is G-bent. Then Eqn (6.4) and Eqn (6.5) imply that

Thus, Eqn (6.3) and Eqn (6.4) imply that

c1d1 + c1d1 = c2d2 + c2d2 = c3d3 + c3d3.

18 + 9(c1d1 + c1d1) = 6 − 3(c1d1 + c1d1).

So c1d1 + c1d1 = −1, and hence c1d1 = −1/2 + b√−1 for some real number b. Therefore, |c1d1| = 1
forces that c1d1 = −1/2±√−3/2, and d1 = (−1/2±√−3/2)c1. Similarly, d2 = (−1/2±√−3/2)c2,
and d3 = (−1/2 ± √−3/2)c3. On the other hand, assume that d1 = (−1/2 ± √−3/2)c1, d2 =
(−1/2 ± √−3/2)c2, and d3 = (−1/2 ± √−3/2)c3. Then it is easy to verify that

Xλ∈ bXψ0(cid:12)(cid:12)bf (λ)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

= 9, Xη∈ bXψj(cid:12)(cid:12)bf (η)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

= 9,

1 ≤ j ≤ 3.

So f is G-bent, and the lemma holds.

17

Lemma 6.4. With the notation in Notation 6.1, if |X| = 8 and p, q, r are all nonzero, then there
are inﬁnitely many G-bent functions on X.

Proof. Without loss of generality, we may assume that p = 2, q = r = 1. Let f : X → T be a
function, and ci := f (xi), di := f (yi), 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. Then by Eqn (6.2),

(cidi + cidi).

Now assume that f is G-bent. Then Eqn (6.8) and Eqn (6.7) imply that

c3d3 + c3d3 = c4d4 + c4d4

and

(cidi + cidi) = 2 + c3d3 + c3d3.

2Xi=1

Thus, from Eqn (6.6) we see that

40 + 12(c3d3 + c3d3) = 8 − 4(c3dd + c3d3).

So c3d3 + c3d3 = −2, and hence c3d3 = −1 + b√−1 for some real number b. Therefore, |c3d3| = 1
forces that c3d3 = −1, and c3 = −d3. Similarly, c4 = −d4. That is, we have proved that

if f is G-bent, then f (x3) = −f (y3), and f (x4) = −f (y4).

(6.9)

On the other hand, let f be a G-bent function such that f (x3) = −f (y3) and f (x4) = −f (y4).
Furthermore, if f (x1) = f (x2) and f (y1) = −f (y2), then from (6.6) – (6.8), it is easy to verify that

Xλij ∈ bXψ0(cid:12)(cid:12)bf (λij)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

= 16, Xηji∈ bXψj(cid:12)(cid:12)bf (ηji)(cid:12)(cid:12)2

= 16,

1 ≤ j ≤ 3.

Hence, f is a G-bent function. Similarly, f is also a G-bent function if f (x1) = f (y1), f (x2) =
−f (y2) or f (x1) = −f (y1), f (x2) = f (y2). Therefore, there are inﬁnitely many G-bent functions
on X.

The next lemma follows directly from Theorem 3.3.

Lemma 6.5. Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group acting on a ﬁnite set X. Assume that X is the
disjoint union of its G-stable subsets Xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ p. If there exists a G-bent function on Xi for
any 1 ≤ i ≤ p, then there exists a G-bent function on X.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 6.2.

sume that r ≤ p, q. Then Eqn (6.1) is equivalent to p + q ≤ 3r.

Thus, Eqn (6.10) and Eqn (6.13) imply that

(cidi + cidi) = 2(q − r) +

p+qXi=p+1
p+q+rXi=p+q+1

(cidi + cidi) = 2r −

2(p + q + r) + 2(p − r) + 2(q − r) + 3

Hence,

p + q − r = −

So Eqn (6.1) holds.

On the other hand, assume that Eqn (6.1) holds. Then by our assumption at the beginning of
the proof, r ≤ p, q and p + q ≤ 3r. Let A = {Xα,i
: 1 ≤ i ≤ q}, and
: 1 ≤ i ≤ r}. Since r ≤ p, q and p + q ≤ 3r, the orbits of G can be divided into r
C = {Xγ,i
families as follows. Each family consists of three or four orbits, with one orbit from each of A, B,
and C, and possibly one more orbit from either A or B if the family consists of four orbits. Since
there exist inﬁnitely many G-bent functions on these families by Lemmas 6.3 and 6.4, there exists
inﬁnitely many G-bent functions on X by Lemma 6.5.
