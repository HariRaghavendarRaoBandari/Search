We present a thorough density functional theory study of the magneto-electric (ME) eﬀect in
Cr2O3. The spin-lattice ME tensor α was determined in the low-ﬁeld and spin ﬂop (SF) phases, using
the method of dynamical magnetic charges, and found to be the sum of three distinct components.
Two of them, a large relativistic “cycloidal” term and a small longitudinal term, are independent on
the spin orientation. The third, only active in the SF phases is also of relativistic origin and arises
from magnetic-ﬁeld-induced chirality, leading to a non-toroidal ME response.

The search for magneto-electric (ME) materials,

in
which the electrical polarisation P (the magnetisation
M ) responds to the application of an external magnetic
ﬁeld H (electric ﬁeld ), has received a lot of attention
in recent years [1–4], particularly in the context of ‘mod-
ern’ multiferroic materials with a spontaneous polarisa-
tion [5]. The linear magneto-electric eﬀect, whereby P is
linearly proportional to H, is also of current technolog-
ical interest for magnetic storage devices, replacements
of SQUIDs, and the ME switching of exchange bias [6–
8]. In the 1950s, Landau and Lifshitz were the ﬁrst to
demonstrate that the ME eﬀect only occurs in magnetic
(i.e., time-reversal odd) materials [9]. Cr2O3, often con-
sidered the prototypical ME, crystallises in the trigonal
corundum structure and, below the N`eel temperature of
TN = 307 K, orders as a collinear antiferromagnet (AFM)
with spins along the rhombohedral [111] direction (Fig.
1). Cr2O3 was predicted to be magneto-electric based on
symmetry considerations [10, 11] — a prediction that was
later veriﬁed experimentally [12–16]. Unlike most other
MEs, Cr2O3
is ME above room temperature, making
it technologically relevant in spite of the small ME re-
sponse [17]. Cr2O3 is also ideal for studying the funda-
mental ME mechanisms, since it is not multiferroic, and
– because of its magnetic point group – exhibits neither
higher-order ME coupling nor piezomagnetism. Never-
theless, there is still a surprising amount of uncertainty
surrounding the ME eﬀect in Cr2O3, and in particular its
behaviour throughout the T-H phase diagram; in turns
this hampers the systematic search for materials with a
stronger ME response.
The linear ME coupling can be described by an axial
tensor of rank two:

(cid:18) ∂Pi

(cid:19)

∂Hj

(cid:18) ∂Mj

(cid:19)

∂i

αij =

= µ0

(1)

with P (M) being the induced polarisation (magnetisa-
tion), H () the external magnetic (electric) ﬁeld, and
µ0 the magnetic permittivity. The components of P and

H are conventionally expressed in a Cartesian coordinate
system, with z along the rhombohedral [111] direction, x
along one of the 2-fold axes, and y completing the right-
handed set. The form of the linear ME tensor αij can
be predicted entirely by symmetry once the AFM point
group is known [18, 19]. In low applied H (LF phase),
the Cr2O3 spins are aligned along z due to magnetic
anisotropy [20, 21] (magnetic point group ¯3(cid:48)m(cid:48)), mak-
ing αij diagonal and α11 and α22 being equal (Fig. 2).
α33 is very small in the ground state, but becomes the
dominant element at room temperature [22, 23]. Under
strong applied ﬁelds along z, Cr2O3 undergoes a ﬁrst-
order phase transition into the so-called spin ﬂop (SF)
phase, with spins ordered in the same G-type pattern,
but directed in the basal plane [24] (middle panel in
Fig. 1). The possible magnetic point groups of the SF
phase, 2(cid:48)/m, 2/m(cid:48), or ¯1(cid:48) for spins parallel or perpendicu-
lar to x or in a generic direction, respectively, also allow
for the ME eﬀect, but with a diﬀerent, oﬀ-diagonal form
of the ME tensor (see Fig. 2), which is indeed observed
experimentally [25]. The ME eﬀect in the SF phase has
often being associated with the appearance of a toroidal
i ri × Si [25, 26]. However due to the
presence of multiple domains in the SF phase (6 domains
are predicted, due the 3-fold symmetry breaking), it is
unclear whether the ME tensor is purely toroidal (anti-
symmetric).

moment T = (cid:80)

In the Letter, we probe the ME eﬀect in the LF and the
in two high-symmetry SF phases (2(cid:48)/m and 2/m(cid:48)) in the
ground state of Cr2O3 by a set of highly-controlled ﬁrst-
principle calculations — an approach that yields results
that are fully consistent with experiments but avoids the
domain problem. We demonstrate that the ‘large’ com-
ponents of the ME tensor in the SF phase are not in-
trinsically toroidal. Rather surprisingly, these compo-
nents are numerically identical to the α11 and α22 tensor
elements in the LF phase, clearly indicating a common
origin. We further show that the signs and identical mag-
nitudes of these ‘large’ ME components can be predicted
from the cycloidal spin-current mechanism, which is well

known in multiferroics. Finally, we show that the ‘small’
ME components in the SF phase arise from two sepa-
rate mechanisms: a longitudinal response (e.g., α33 in
the LF phase), which in the ground state is associated
with a small longitudinal susceptibility of relativistic ori-
gin, whereas it becomes the dominant response at room
temperature [27], and a novel chiral ME coupling.

The ME response of Cr2O3 in the LF phase has been
the subject of a number of ﬁrst-principles studies [27, 29–
34]. The spin-lattice response αlatt has been shown to be

dominant [33], and we therefore focus on this contribu-
tion. We take the approach of Ref. [34] and expand the
macroscopic response into microscopic quantities as fol-
lows:

with the indices k, l = 1, 2, 3 and the composite in-
dices (accounting for three directional dimensions and
the number of atoms in the unit cell N ) i, j = 1, . . . , 3N .
Eq. 2 shows a trilinear relation involving the Born eﬀec-
tive charges (BEC) Z e
, the inverse
= ∂ui∂uj
of the force-constant (FC) matrix K−1
∂E ,
and the dynamical magnetic charges (MC). The latter
can be understood as the magnetic analogue of the BEC
and are deﬁned as the derivative of the Hellman-Feynman
forces with respect to a magnetic ﬁeld, Z m
=
µ−1
, using B = µH ≈ µ0H and the permeability
0
(vacuum permeability) µ (µ0) being µ ≈ µ0 in AFMs.
We calculate the three contributions to Eq. 2 using
Density Functional Theory within the local density ap-
proximation. We ﬁnd that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has
a very small eﬀect on the BEC and FC matrix (less than

jl = ∂Fj

∂Bl

∂Fj
∂Hl

1(cid:104)) and we therefore compute these quantities without

SOC. This means that our BEC and FC matrix are the
same in all three magnetic phases. In contrast, the MC
are a SOC induced eﬀect and we compute them using
a non-collinear magnetism formalism employing SOC. A
Zeeman magnetic ﬁeld is applied according to Ref.
[32]
and the change in the ionic forces calculated. It is there-
fore the changes in the MC which determine the diﬀering
form of αlatt in the three magnetic phases. Full details of
the DFT calculations, including an analysis of the inﬂu-
ence of the choice of exchange-correlation functional are
provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Our results for the LF ¯3(cid:48)m(cid:48) phase were benchmarked
against Ref. [34] leading to almost identical results. A
full comparison to literature values is given in the Supple-
mentary Material. Table I shows our results for the mag-
netic charges and for the ME tensor for the LF ¯3(cid:48)m(cid:48) phase
with spins parallel to z, and the two SF phases, 2(cid:48)/m and
2/m(cid:48), with spins parallel and perpendicular to x, which
is also the direction of the surviving 2-fold axis. The ten-
sor forms for both quantities are in good agreement with
our group theoretical analysis from Fig. 2. To within
±0.001 ps m−1, which we take to be our computational
uncertainty, the ME coupling tensors, are as predicted
(bottom row of Fig. 2 and right column of table I).

Because in the ¯3(cid:48)m(cid:48) phase all improper rotations are
coupled to time-reversal symmetry, the MC are of the
same form as the BEC. Therefore, those phonon modes
that couple to the electric ﬁeld, i.e., the infrared (IR)
active modes, are also the ones that couple to the mag-
netic ﬁeld. In the R¯3c space group, the IR active modes
are the doubly degenerate Eu modes, which are active

in the xy plane, and the singly degenerate A2u modes,
active along z. Not including the acoustic modes, the
Γ-centred IR active modes are therefore

ΓIR = 4Eu + 2A2u.

(3)

From a mode decomposition of the BEC and the MC,
we observe changes in the magneto-active response when
x and y are no longer equivalent. The degeneracy of the
IR active Eu modes is removed, and other modes become
magneto-active in x, y, or z. We also ﬁnd that the ex-
ceptionally large component in the Z m(Cr) (the 32 and
31 component in the 2(cid:48)/m and 2/m(cid:48) phase, respectively)
maps onto magneto-active modes that are mutually ex-
clusive to the IR active ones. That value has therefore
no eﬀect on the coupling tensor. Even though the mag-
netic charge tensors are quite dissimilar, this leads to the
rather surprising similarity of the coupling tensors. The
full mode decomposition of the BEC and the MC for the
LF phase is given in the Supplementary Material.

On this basis, we make the following important ob-
servations. Firstly, the ME tensor α is not what one
would expect from a toroidal moment. There is clearly
a toroidal (antisymmetric) component, but this is iden-
tical in magnitude to the traceless symmetric compo-
nent. This should not be particularly surprising, since
the toroidal mechanism P = T × H does not capture the
large diﬀerence between the longitudinal and transverse
susceptibilities. Secondly, the magnitudes of the ‘large’
elements of the ME tensor is the same (within error) in
the two SF phases and in the LF phase. In fact, all these
large ME responses can be approximated by the following
compact expression:

 ˆmz

0
0



0 − ˆmx
ˆmz − ˆmy
0
0

αlatt ≈ 0.31 ps m−1

(4)

where ˆmx, ˆmy and ˆmz are the components of a unit vec-
tor parallel to the spin on the Cr(4c) atom at Wyckoﬀ
position 0.1590. A clue as to the origin of this tensor
form is the fact the all these components correspond to

a transverse spin response in the plane containing both
the spins and z, so that the rotated spins under the ac-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld can be thought as forming a
segment of a cycloid. Here below, we show that the ten-
sor form in Eq. 4 is exactly the one predicted from the
spin current [35] or inverse Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM)
[36] mechanisms, which are well known in the context of
multiferroics. We write the transverse response of the
magnetisation mi on Cr site i as

(cid:18)

∆mi = χT mi × (H × mi)

= χT

m2
mi (H · mi)

m2

H −

(cid:19)

(5)

where χT is the transverse susceptibility. The inverse
DM polarisation is:

P = µr12 × (m1 × m2) = 2µχT r12 × (m × H)

= 2µχT (m (H · r12) − H (m · r12))

(6)

where µ is a coupling constant and, in the case of Cr2O3,
r12 (cid:107) c. With this, the ME tensor takes the form:

 mz

α = 2µχT (m ⊗ r12 − m · r121)

= −2µχT

0 −mx
0 mz −my
0
0
0



(7)

where ⊗ is the outer (tensor) product and 1 is the unit
tensor. Eq. 7 and Eq. 4 have exactly the same form,
including the non-trivial sign of the tensor elements.

In all phases, the ME tensor latt has a small longitu-
dinal term (i.e., with the ﬁeld H parallel to the spins) of
magnitude 0.005 ps m−1 (0.019 ps m−1) for the LF (SF)
phase(s), which generates P (cid:107) z in all cases.
In the
ground state, this is associated with a small longitudinal
susceptibility of relativistic origin, while at ﬁnite temper-
atures, the symmetric Heisenberg exchange makes this
term become the dominant contribution to α in the LF
phase, as shown in Ref.

[27].

Considerably more interesting is the additional in-
plane transverse term of magnitude −0.012 ps m−1,
which is only present in the SF phases. Here, the ﬁeld
H lies in the xy plane perpendicular to the spins and
generates P (cid:107) x,
i.e., to the surviving 2-fold axis of
the monoclinic structure. Phenomenologically, this term
is associated with a ﬁfth order invariant of the form
(m2
y)Ax − 2mxmyAy where A = (myHx − mxHy)P
transforms as an axial (parity-even) vector.
In the re-
mainder, we show that this term is due to the breaking
of axial symmetry upon SF magnetic ordering, coupled
with the breaking of chiral symmetry upon application
of a magnetic ﬁeld in the in-plane transverse direction.

x − m2

As we already mentioned, SF magnetic ordering breaks
the 3-fold symmetry. Consequently, the crystallographic
symmetry is also lowered, due to coupling of the stag-
gered magnetisation with a structural order parameter,
which has the transformation properties of an axial vec-
tor A. Minimising the Landau free energy with respect
to A in the usual way, one obtains:

x − m2
Ax = λ(m2
y)
Ay = −λ(mxmy)

(8)

where λ is a (small) magneto-elastic coupling constant.
It is noteworthy that Ay = 0 in both of the SF phases we
considered, so A is directed along x. Upon application of
a magnetic ﬁeld in the in-plane transverse direction, the
rotated spins can be thought as forming a segment of a
helix, which has the distinct chirality r12 · (m1 × m2). In
analogy to the ferroaxial multiferroic mechanism [37, 38],
we can therefore write the following phenomenological
polarisation:

Px = µλ(m2

x − m2
= 2µχT λ(m2
= 2µχT λ(m2

y) r12 · (m1 × m2)
x − m2
y) r12 · (m × H)
x − m2
y) (r12 × m) · H

Py = 0

yielding

α = 2µχT λ(m2

x − m2

y)ˆx ⊗ (r12 × m)

(9)

(10)

where ˆx is a unit vector along x. Since (r12 × m) =

(−my, mx, 0), the ME tensor has the desired form

 my mx 0



0
0

0
0

0
0

α = −2µχT λm2

(11)

which corresponds to the ﬁrst-principle result. By com-
paring Eq. 11 with Eq. 7, one can understand why the
former, containing the small parameter λ, is considerably
smaller than the latter.

In summary, we have computed the magneto-electric
tensor of Cr2O3 in both low-ﬁeld and high-ﬁeld (spin
ﬂop) phases by means of highly-controlled ﬁrst-principle
calculations. We ﬁnd that the ME tensor is not pri-
marily toroidal, as previously speculated.
Instead, its
approximate form can be well predicted phenomenologi-
cally using the spin-current model, which is well known
in multiferroics. There are two additional small compo-
nents: the ﬁrst is a longitudinal component known from
previous studies of the low-ﬁeld phase, while the second
arises from a novel chiral mechanism, which is akin to
the ferroaxial mechanisms in multiferroics.
