We investigate a hybrid quantum system consisting of spatially separated resonant exchange
qubits, deﬁned in three-electron semiconductor triple quantum dots, that are coupled via a super-
conducting transmission line resonator. Drawing on methods from circuit quantum electrodynamics
and Hartmann-Hahn double resonance techniques, we analyze three speciﬁc approaches for imple-
menting resonator-mediated two-qubit entangling gates in both dispersive and resonant regimes of
interaction. We calculate entangling gate ﬁdelities as well as the rate of relaxation via phonons for
resonant exchange qubits in silicon triple dots and show that such an implementation is particularly
well-suited to achieving the strong coupling regime. Our approach combines the favorable coher-
ence properties of encoded spin qubits in silicon with the rapid and robust long-range entanglement
provided by circuit QED systems.

INTRODUCTION

The simultaneous realization of coherent local control
of quantum bits (qubits) and robust long-range interac-
tions for entangling distant qubits represents a funda-
mental goal in many proposed implementations of quan-
tum information processing.1,2 Hybrid approaches may
prove particularly advantageous for achieving this goal,
as they enable the optimal properties of multiple physi-
cally distinct quantum systems to be combined.3

Electron spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots
promise protection from environmental decoherence and
potential scalability to larger systems.3–6 An alternative
to the challenges of coherently controlling single electron
spins via, e.g., highly localized magnetic ﬁelds,7 spin-
orbit coupling,8,9 or spin-position coupling via magnetic
ﬁeld gradients10,11 is provided by the encoding of sin-
gle logical qubits in multiple electron spins.5,12–18 Within
systems of two or more coupled quantum dots, such an
encoding eﬀectively translates magnetic ﬁeld control to
electric ﬁeld control, providing a means of rapidly ma-
nipulating individual qubits, while allowing for operation
within decoherence-free subspaces that protect against
collective decoherence and leakage errors.19

Three-electron spin qubits enable universal manipula-
tion to be achieved via electric ﬁeld control of exchange
interactions alone.14–18,20–23 However, the electrostatic
origin of exchange renders these spin qubits susceptible
to charge noise. The particular form of the exchange-only
qubit known as the resonant exchange (RX) qubit enables
high-frequency operation via resonant microwave driving
of the exchange at a “sweet spot,” where a large exchange
energy gap suppresses the sensitivity of the qubit to low-
frequency charge noise.17,18,24–26 Thus, the RX qubit rep-
resents a semiconductor qubit similar to the transmon su-
perconducting qubit27,28 that additionally possesses the
protection intrinsic to spin qubits.3,6

A key element of a scalable quantum information pro-

cessor based on multielectron spin qubits is the imple-
mentation of long-range entangling gates. The exchange
interaction can be used to perform rapid, protected gates
between neighboring exchange-only qubits;14,29–33 how-
ever, the range of the interaction is limited by its depen-
dence on the overlap of the wave functions of the electrons
participating in the coupling, which decreases exponen-
tially with the separation between electrons.19,34 Longer-
range coupling is possible via the Coulomb interaction
and can be used to carry out entangling gates between ad-
jacent capacitively coupled exchange-only qubits18,35,36
without the leakage intrinsic to two-qubit exchange
gates.14,29,30,32,33,37 The range of exchange-based inter-
actions can be extended via spin chains,38,39 while that of
capacitive interactions can be extended via ﬂoating metal
gates.40 In the context of a modular quantum computer
architecture,5,41 these schemes provide potential meth-
ods of coupling spatially separated spin qubits within a
single module.

In order to enable full scalability and modularity
within a quantum information processing device, how-
ever, a rapid and robust interaction between qubits
within diﬀerent modules that are separated by macro-
scopic distances is highly desirable.5,41 For superconduct-
ing qubits, such an interaction can be realized within
the approach of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED),
where qubits separated by distances of up to the or-
der of centimeters are coupled capacitively to the mi-
crowave ﬁeld of a superconducting transmission line
resonator.42–48 An analogous approach has been inves-
tigated for hybrid solid-state quantum systems consist-
ing of semiconductor charge49–54 or spin49,55–61 qubits
coupled to a superconducting resonator. The potentially
longer coherence times possible for spin qubits, particu-
larly in silicon,23,62–67 in comparison to superconducting
qubits and quantum dot charge qubits are advantageous
for achieving the strong coupling regime, in which the
interaction rate exceeds both the qubit and cavity decay

rates.42,49

Here, we consider two RX qubits coupled via the fun-
damental mode of a superconducting transmission line
resonator as a potential building block for a robust mod-
ular quantum information processing device. The rela-
tively large dipole moment of the RX qubit compared
to double-dot qubits, arising from the more delocalized
three-electron wave function within a triple quantum
dot device,17,18 should enable each RX qubit to inter-
act strongly with the resonator ﬁeld. At the same time,
the smaller size of the triple dot relative to that of, e.g.,
a transmon47,48 should prove useful in scaling to more
qubits. Furthermore, the enhanced protection of the RX
qubit from low-frequency charge noise at its optimal op-
erating point in principle leads to coherence times suﬃ-
ciently long for realizing the strong coupling regime.18

We begin by deriving the form of the coupling between
a single RX qubit and a transmission line resonator. Con-
current work investigates this coupling in detail from
a microscopic perspective.68 Subsequently, we analyze
three speciﬁc approaches for resonator-mediated entan-
glement of RX qubits based on techniques drawn from
both circuit QED and Hartmann-Hahn double resonance
in NMR.69 For each of these approaches, we explicitly de-
rive the form of the interaction and construct two-qubit
entangling gates. Finally, we explore the feasibility of im-
plementing our proposed gates using RX qubits deﬁned
within silicon triple quantum dots. We ﬁnd that silicon
provides qubit relaxation times several orders of mag-
nitude longer than those for GaAs18 and calculate gate
ﬁdelities for the three approaches in the presence of qubit
dephasing and cavity decay. Our results suggest that the
longer coherence times expected for RX qubits in silicon
enable the strong coupling regime to be attained with
currently achievable resonator quality factors and should
lead to high-ﬁdelity two-qubit entangling gates in combi-
nation with rapid, exchange-based universal single-qubit
control.17,18

II. DIPOLE COUPLING OF A RESONANT
EXCHANGE QUBIT TO A TRANSMISSION

LINE RESONATOR

We consider a resonant exchange (RX) qubit, realized
within a linear triple quantum dot in the three-electron
regime.17,18 In the present work, we follow Ref. 18 and
focus on the subspace of three-electron states having total
spin S = 1/2 and spin quantum number for the total z
component ms = 1/2 in the charge subspaces (2,0,1),
(1,1,1), and (1,0,2) (Fig. 1). Here, (n1, n2, n3) denotes
the charge occupation of each dot (numbered from left to
right). We assume that a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld
is applied in the plane of the device16 in order to minimize
its eﬀect on the superconducting state of the resonator70
and is suﬃciently large (typically (cid:38) 100 mT17) such that
other three-electron states are energetically distant from
the subspace we consider.18 For RX qubits implemented

ms = 1/2 spin subspace as a function of /t for ∆/t = 3,
with t = tl = tr. A large uniform external magnetic ﬁeld (for
which the Zeeman splitting is much larger than t) is assumed
to separate the subspace considered in the present work from
other three-electron states, and the remaining nearby state

(cid:11) has S = 3/2.18 The operating point considered in the

in silicon, we also assume that excited valley states are
well-separated in energy from the lowest-energy valley
manifold (see Sec. IV). The resulting subspace is spanned
by the (1,1,1) states

form charge state (1,1,1) of a three-electron triple dot
does not interact directly with the microwave ﬁeld of
the resonator, the logical states of the RX qubit contain
small admixtures of the polarized charge states (2,0,1)
and (1,0,2), enabling coupling to the resonator ﬁeld (Fig.

Introducing a small variation F in the detuning such
that  = 0+F, we write the Hamiltonian of the RX qubit
as H ≈ Heﬀ|=0 + ∂Heﬀ|=0 F. Note that by comparing
this expansion with the expression for ˜d in Eq. (7), the
second term of H can be identiﬁed with the standard
dipole coupling Hamiltonian. The operating point  = 0
for the RX qubit is chosen such that the coupling to
F, which is proportional to ∂Heﬀ , is perpendicular to
the quantization axis in a Bloch sphere representation of
the RX qubit. This choice corresponds to the condition
∂J = − (3j/J) ∂j. Deﬁning σz ≡ |e(cid:105)(cid:104)e| − |g(cid:105)(cid:104)g| , where

We now determine the coupling strength for the in-
teraction of the RX qubit with the lowest-energy mode
of a transmission line resonator (Fig. 2). A resonator
of length l, capacitance per unit length C0, and induc-
tance per unit length L0 has a characteristic impedance
L0/C0. The fundamental mode of the resonator

conductor of the resonator.
In terms of the total ca-
pacitance Cc between the resonator and the triple dot
and the total capacitance Cd between the triple dot and

where s is the eﬀective distance over which the voltage

In the representation

becomes ∂Heﬀ . Since the dipole coupling Hamiltonian
˜Hint = ∂Heﬀ|=0 F as discussed above, we also note
that the interaction with the transmission line resonator
is described by quantizing F and setting F = ew ˆVd/2s
so that the oscillation in the detuning of the RX qubit
is controlled by the resonator voltage. At the operating
point  = 0, which corresponds to ∂J = − (3j/J) ∂j,
the interaction Hamiltonian in the qubit basis {|g(cid:105) ,|e(cid:105)}
takes the form

To estimate the interaction strength g, we choose
0 = 0 as the operating point for the qubit (see Fig.
1). At this point, Jl = Jr = t2/∆, while ∂J = 0 and
∂j = −t2/∆2. Deﬁning the charge admixture parameter
ξ ≡ t/∆, this gives η = √3ξ2/2. For simplicity, we set
s = w in Eq. (12). Choosing Z0 = 50 Ω, v = 0.28,42,49
and ω0 = 2π × 1.5 GHz56 (where we assume kBT (cid:28) ω0
in order to neglect thermal excitation of photons) leads
to a charge-cavity coupling strength g0 ≈ 2π × 13 MHz.
Taking ξ = 0.3,18 we then ﬁnd g ≈ 2π × 1 MHz for the
strength of the coupling between the RX qubit and the
transmission line resonator, which is comparable to that
found experimentally for spin qubits in double quantum
dots coupled to a higher-frequency resonator.59 We note
that, while the qubit-resonator coupling strength g is lim-
ited by the constraint ξ (cid:28) 1 required for the validity of
the Heisenberg model description of the RX qubit,18 the
estimate we obtain here does not represent a fundamen-
tal limit and varies strongly with the chosen parame-
ters. Further enhancements of g may be possible by, e.g.,
modifying the design of the transmission line resonator
to increase the strength of the electric ﬁeld within the
region containing the RX qubit60,70 and thus the charge-
cavity coupling strength g0. Recent work70 demonstrates
a characteristic impedance Z0 ≈ 4 kΩ for superconduct-
ing nanowire resonators with high kinetic inductance,
which leads to g0 ≈ 2π × 120 MHz and g ≈ 2π × 9 MHz
for the same values of ω0, v and ξ chosen above.
The value of g we determine here is nevertheless suf-
ﬁcient for reaching the strong coupling regime of the
RX qubit-resonator interaction in realistic systems, as
we now show. The strong coupling regime corresponds
to g > κ, γ, where κ = ω0/Q is the rate of decay of
microwave photons out of the resonator, Q is the res-
onator quality factor, and γ = 1/T ∗2 is the qubit decay
rate.42,49 This regime is characterized by a transfer of
excitations between the qubit and the resonator that is
more rapid than the qubit and photon decay rates and is
thus of fundamental importance for resonator-mediated

entangling gates. For the estimated coupling strength
g = 2π × 9 MHz and ω0 = 2π × 1.5 GHz, the strong
coupling regime can be achieved when the conditions
Q > ω0/g ≈ 160 and T ∗2 > 1/g ≈ 17 ns are satis-
ﬁed. Recent experiments50,53,59 suggest that suﬃciently
high quality factors are already attainable in coupled dot-
resonator systems. In addition, a single RX qubit imple-
mented in a GaAs triple quantum dot has a dephasing
time T ∗2 ≈ 500 ns, and an increase of the coherence time
to T2 ≈ 20 µs via echo has been demonstrated.17 The
strong coupling regime should therefore be attainable for
ξ (cid:28) 0.3, which is advantageous for RX qubits in GaAs
dots as the rate of qubit decay due to phonons is ex-
pected to increase as ∼ ξ4.18 In Sec. IV, we consider re-
laxation due to electron-phonon coupling for RX qubits
in Si triple dots and ﬁnd that, for this system, phonon-
induced decay is unlikely to limit qubit coherence. Thus,
Si-based RX qubits should in principle enable operation
in the strong coupling regime for larger dipole moments
(i.e., larger η ∼ ξ2), which should lead to more rapid
entangling gates.

III. RESONATOR-MEDIATED ENTANGLING

GATES FOR TWO RX QUBITS

We now explore three speciﬁc approaches for entan-
gling two spatially separated RX qubits which are both
coupled to the fundamental mode of a transmission line
resonator via their electric dipole moments (Fig.
3).
As we show below, methods developed for coupling su-
perconducting qubits in circuit QED42,44 along with
Hartmann-Hahn double resonance techniques for exter-
nally driven systems69 can be directly applied to RX
qubits, in combination with fast single-qubit rotations
via exchange. We explicitly derive the eﬀective interac-
tions and the two-qubit entangling gates they generate
for each approach, while including relevant prior results
from circuit QED for completeness.

In Sec. III A, we consider the interaction between two
RX qubits with identical transition frequencies mediated
by virtual excitations of the resonator in the dispersive
regime, which gives rise to gate rates ∼ g2/ ˜∆ ∼ ξ4, where
˜∆ denotes the detuning of the qubit transition frequency

with respect to the resonator frequency. We describe an
alternative approach in Sec. III B, which involves driv-
ing each qubit with resonant microwave ﬁelds to gen-
erate sideband transitions in a doubly rotating frame.
This approach leads to a gate rate that scales linearly
with the coupling strength g ∼ ξ2, potentially provid-
ing a faster gate than that discussed in Sec. III A. Fi-
nally, we consider the dispersive regime for the driven
resonator-mediated interaction between two RX qubits
having diﬀerent transition frequencies in Sec. III C. We
show how transforming to a doubly rotating frame en-
ables two-qubit entangling gates with rates ∼ ξ4 even in
the presence of the qubit frequency variation.
Identifying the regime which optimizes two-qubit gate
ﬁdelities for a particular implementation involves a com-
parison of the qubit and resonator photon coherence
times. Two-qubit gates in the dispersive regime are ex-
pected to have higher ﬁdelities for systems where the
qubit coherence time exceeds the resonator photon co-
herence time, as the interaction is mediated only by vir-
tual resonator photons. On the other hand, ﬁdelities for
two-qubit gates based on the direct qubit-resonator in-
teraction in the resonant regime are limited by both the
qubit and the resonator photon coherence times. In Sec.
V, we show that this intuition is consistent with calcu-
lated gate ﬁdelities for the three regimes we consider.

A. Dispersive regime

Initially, we consider two RX qubits coupled to the
resonator in the absence of external driving ﬁelds. Us-
ing Eqs. (8) and (13), the Hamiltonian of the combined
system can be written as Hd = H0 + V, where (setting

For τ = τn ≡ (4n + 1) π ˜∆/2gagb, where n is an integer,
Eq. (27) yields the iSWAP gate. This two-qubit entan-
gling gate can be combined with single qubit rotations to
form a universal set of quantum gates.72 The gate Ud has
a rate given by gagb/ ˜∆ ∼ g2/ ˜∆ ∼ ξ4, where we assume
gb ∼ ga ≡ g.

B. Driven resonant regime

The two-qubit entangling gates considered in Sec. III A
have rates that scale as g2/ ˜∆ ∼ ξ4. Thus, these gates
are limited in speed by both the condition ξ (cid:28) 1 for
the validity of the Heisenberg model18 and the fact that
they are carried out in the dispersive regime, where
g (cid:28) ˜∆. In order to obtain more rapid gates with rates
that vary linearly with g ∼ ξ2, we now consider an al-
ternative approach for generating entanglement between
two RX qubits based on microwave driving of sideband
transitions,44,73,74 in the spirit of the Cirac-Zoller gate
for two-level ions.75,76 When a microwave driving ﬁeld
resonant with one of the qubit transitions is applied to
the resonator, the qubit-resonator interaction [Eq. (13)]
enables driving of the qubit at its Rabi frequency. In a
frame rotating at both the drive and Rabi frequencies,
the interaction of the resonator with each qubit leads to
sideband transitions for appropriately chosen frequencies
of the driving ﬁeld.44 These transitions can be used to
construct two-qubit entangling gates.75,76 Here, we show
how this approach applies directly to two RX qubits cou-
pled to a transmission line resonator and explicitly derive
the full gate sequence for a controlled-Z (π-phase) gate.
To obtain the eﬀective Hamiltonians which generate
sideband transitions, we begin by considering the inter-
action of a single RX qubit with the resonator in the
presence of an external driving ﬁeld. Writing Eqs. (15)
and (16) for a single qubit and adding a term describing
driving of the resonator (see Fig. 3) by an applied mi-
crowave ﬁeld of frequency ν, amplitude ε, and phase φ
gives

Hr = ω0˜a†˜a +

where we use a modiﬁed notation for the resonator mode
operators ˜a and ˜a† for convenience in later expressions.
We work in a regime where the driving ﬁeld amplitude
ε and the detuning ∆0 ≡ ω0 − ν are suﬃciently large
that we can neglect the quantum ﬂuctuations of the driv-
ing ﬁeld arising from its interaction with the resonator
and approximate the drive as a classical ﬁeld.44 In this
regime, we can eliminate terms describing the direct ac-
tion of the drive on the resonator from the Hamilto-
nian by applying a displacement transformation using
˜a and setting α (τ ) equal to the steady-
D (α) ≡ eα˜a
state solution of ˙α + iω0α + iεe−i(ντ +φ) = 0, which gives
α (τ ) = −εe−i(ντ +φ)/∆0. This choice of α yields

to
a second frame rotating at the Rabi frequency 2Ω for the
qubit and at the eﬀective frequency ∆0 for the resonator

2Ω in Eq. (38) and neglect the rapidly oscillating terms
containing σ+a†, σ−a, σza, and σza† to obtain

(cid:0)eiφσ+a + e−iφσ−a†(cid:1) .

H− =

Alternatively, setting ∆0 = −2Ω, we ﬁnd that the rapidly
oscillating terms are those containing σ+a, σ−a†, σza,
and σza†. After dropping these terms, Eq. (38) becomes

The Hamiltonians H−
and H+ generate “red” and “blue”
sideband transitions, respectively,44,76 as can be veriﬁed
by considering their action on the qubit-resonator basis

where θ ≡ gτ. Thus, although ω (cid:54)= ω0, driving each RX
qubit resonantly and moving to a doubly rotating frame
via U1 and U2 [Eqs. (31) and (35)] generates sideband
transitions that transfer excitations between the qubit
and the resonator via an eﬀective resonance in the doubly
rotating frame that is enabled by the combination of the
drive and resonator photons.

We now construct a controlled-phase gate for two RX
qubits using Eqs. (41) and (42). Here, we focus on the
controlled-Z (π-phase) gate. Following the approach of
Ref. 76, we use a sequence of red sideband transitions to

which acts on a single qubit coupled to the resonator. As
discussed in Ref. 76, this gate plays a role equivalent to
the 2π pulse used in the Cirac-Zoller sequence for trapped
ions75 but requires only the two levels of a qubit, in con-
trast to resonant approaches proposed for superconduct-
ing qubits.77 As W also prevents leakage to resonator
states other than |0(cid:105) and |1(cid:105), we can consider the sub-
space {|g, 0(cid:105) ,|g, 1(cid:105) ,|e, 0(cid:105) ,|e, 1(cid:105)} . In this basis, Eq. (43)

where the added subscripts a, b indicate the qubit on

In the zero-photon subspace
{|e, e, 0(cid:105) ,|e, g, 0(cid:105) ,|g, e, 0(cid:105) ,|g, g, 0(cid:105)}, UCZ takes the form
of a controlled-Z gate with respect to the two-qubit basis
states and thus entangles the two qubits.

Note that, in addition to W and additional sideband
transitions, the full sequence for the controlled-Z gate in
Eq. (45) requires single-qubit rotations about the z axis
of the Bloch sphere for each RX qubit. As seen from Eq.
(8), rapid single-qubit rotations for the RX qubit can be
generated via exchange.17,18 In the absence of detuning
variations about the operating point (i.e., for F = 0),
HRX generates a rotation Rz (ϕ) ≡ e−i(ϕ/2)σz about the
z axis of the Bloch sphere of a RX qubit, with ϕ = ωτ.
With qubit-resonator coupling present, a z-axis rotation
for a particular qubit can be carried out by tuning ω
such that
the interaction of the qubit with the resonator eﬀectively
vanishes.

While the qubit frequency must be well-separated from
the resonator frequency ω0, we note that ω (cid:29) g is

S−S−S+S+ω0ω|g,0|g,1|e,1|e,0also satisﬁed for typical system parameters (e.g., ω ∼
2π × 1 GHz18 and g (cid:46) 2π × 10 MHz). Thus, we expect
the two-qubit gate rate to be limited by that of the side-
band gates. As all sideband gates in Eq. (45) are gener-
ated by interactions that depend linearly on the coupling
strength g via θ = gτ, and as the exchange-generated
single-qubit rotations have a rate ω (cid:29) g, this suggests
that the overall two-qubit gate rate scales as g ∼ ξ2.
The driven resonant regime should therefore enable more
rapid gates than those discussed in Sec. III A. We note
that the resonant regime of quantum dot-cavity coupling
has been achieved in recent experiments,78 which demon-
strate measurements of the transition to this regime via
the observation of an enhanced intensity of the resonant
sideband of the Mollow triplet characteristic of a strongly
driven two-level system.79

Generating entanglement between RX qubits in the
presence of variation in their transition frequencies en-
ables both two-qubit gates and addressability of individ-
ual qubits. Thus, we now consider the dispersive regime
for two qubits coupled to the resonator with ωa (cid:54)= ωb. In
contrast to the approach of Sec. III A, we also include
a microwave driving ﬁeld acting on the resonator (see
Sec. III B and Fig. 3) with a frequency ν equal to the
transition frequency of one qubit. Interaction with the
resonator shifts both the Rabi frequency of the qubit res-
onant with the driving ﬁeld and the diﬀerence of the qubit
transition frequencies. We derive an entangling gate that
is generated by the eﬀective interaction in a frame rotat-
ing at both the drive frequency and the modiﬁed qubit
Rabi and diﬀerence frequencies. This doubly rotating
frame enables energy exchange between the qubits even
when they have diﬀerent transition frequencies, in anal-
ogy to Hartmann-Hahn double resonance in NMR.69,80

IMPLEMENTATION IN SI TRIPLE

QUANTUM DOTS

We now consider the feasibility of implementing the
approaches for entangling RX qubits discussed in the
present work within silicon quantum dots. Recent work
has demonstrated rapid, coherent control of a single RX
qubit in a GaAs triple dot.17 However, in addition to
gate voltage noise, the coherence is expected to be fur-
ther limited in GaAs by the nuclear spin environment

9

and by piezoelectric phonons,18 which typically repre-
sent the dominant sources of charge and spin relaxation
in GaAs quantum dots.6 Implementing RX qubits in Si
potentially provides improved coherence due to a low nu-
clear spin concentration, which can be made to approach
zero via isotopic puriﬁcation, as well as to the absence of
piezoelectric phonons.23,62–67 However, the valley degree
of freedom in Si leads to a more complex low-energy spec-
trum than that of GaAs. Thus, a direct extension of RX
qubit properties to Si is not obviously straightforward.

Here, we focus on the eﬀects of relaxation due to
electron-phonon coupling in the context of the ap-
proaches described in the present work. We assume that
each RX qubit is coupled independently to the same
phonon bath and calculate the relaxation rate for a single
three-electron triple quantum dot in Si. In order to iden-
tify the most relevant relaxation transition, we note that
a typical single-dot valley splitting EV (cid:38) 100 µeV,62,81
while typical qubit frequencies that set the gap be-
tween the qubit basis states |g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105) correspond to
ω < 10 µeV. Thus, we assume that ω determines the
lowest relevant gap for the RX qubit and that the dom-
inant relaxation process is charge relaxation from |e(cid:105) to
|g(cid:105) within the lowest-energy valley manifold. The calcu-
lation is then similar to that performed in Ref. 18 for the
case of a GaAs triple dot.

Unlike GaAs, however, the crystal structure of un-
strained Si has a center of inversion symmetry, which
leads to the absence of piezoelectric phonons. The
electron-phonon interaction for Si therefore consists only
of deformation potential terms. In the presence of strain
along the [001] (z(cid:48)) axis, we can write this interaction
as82

Hep = Ξd∇ · u + Ξu

tion potentials, respectively, and the phonon displace-

of ω and ξ shown in the ﬁgure, the relaxation rate is
well approximated by Γ = ω5

0
ν0 = 2π × 110 GHz. We thus ﬁnd that the relaxation
rate for Si exhibits a ∼ ω5 exchange gap dependence, in
contrast to the ∼ ω3 dependence for GaAs (see Ref. 18).
We note in particular that Γ (cid:46) 10 Hz for all values of ξ
and ω shown, which is much smaller than typical values
. Thus, in contrast to GaAs implementations,18
of T ∗−1
the coherence time for a RX qubit in a Si triple quantum
dot is unlikely to be limited by phonon-induced decay.
Si-based RX qubits should therefore enable the strong
coupling regime to be achieved for larger ξ2, which in
principle leads to more rapid and robust entangling gates.

V. PERFORMANCE OF ENTANGLING GATES

Finally, we consider the performance of the two-qubit
entangling gates for RX qubits discussed in Sec. III and
calculate gate ﬁdelities for each of the three regimes. As
we have seen for RX qubits in Si triple quantum dots, the
absence of piezoelectric phonons is expected to lead to
qubit relaxation times which are much longer than qubit
dephasing times (see Sec. IV and Fig. 5). We therefore
assume in the present analysis that the dominant decay
processes are pure dephasing of the qubits with rates γa,b
and the decay of photons out of the resonant cavity with
rate κ. Throughout this section, we focus on the strong
coupling regime γa,b, κ < g of the qubit-resonator inter-
actions and assume that ω0 > ωµ for µ = a, b.

A. Dispersive regime

We ﬁrst consider the dispersive regime, deﬁned by
gµ (cid:28) ˜∆µ = ω0 − ωµ (see Sec. III A). After making a ro-
tating wave approximation for ˜∆µ (cid:28) ω0 +ωµ, the Hamil-
tonian describing the system is Hd = H0 + V, where H0
and V are given by Eqs. (15) and (17), respectively. We
describe the corresponding time evolution in the pres-
ence of qubit dephasing and cavity decay by the master
equation44,84

where ρd represents the density matrix of the combined
system consisting of both qubits and the resonator. In
order to obtain the gate ﬁdelity, we compare the solution
of Eq. (68) with that for the ideal evolution (for which
γa,b = κ = 0).
For simplicity, we set ωa = ωb ≡ ω (which corresponds
to ˜∆a = ˜∆b ≡ ˜∆), ga = gb ≡ g, and γa = γb ≡ γ in
what follows. As we consider the dispersive regime of
qubit-resonator coupling, we also conﬁne our description

frequency ω and the charge admixture parameter ξ = t/∆.

and r is the electron position operator.

The rate Γ of qubit relaxation due to Hep is given by
Fermi’s golden rule as Γ ∼ |(cid:104)g| Hep |e(cid:105)|2 ρ (ω), where ρ (ω)
is the phonon density of states evaluated at the exchange
gap ω between the logical qubit states |g(cid:105) and |e(cid:105) that de-
termines the energy of the emitted phonon. We can write
the relaxation rate as Γ = slIl (ω/cl) + spIp (ω/cp) ,
which is expressed in terms of the momentum-space an-
gular integrals

In order to obtain Eqs. (65) and (66), we have chosen
one of the two transverse (µ = p) polarization axes to
lie perpendicular to the direction of uniaxial strain ˆz(cid:48)
and deﬁned β as the angle between k and ˆz(cid:48). We have
also deﬁned the dimensionless parameter Λ ≡ Ξu/Ξd and
used Ωang to denote the momentum-space solid angle.
The relaxation rate at the RX qubit operation point
0 = 0 is plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of the ex-
change gap ω and the charge admixture parameter ξ.
The parameters used to calculate Γ are the Si trans-
verse eﬀective mass m∗ = 0.19 me, the single-dot size
σ = 23 nm and left-right dot separation w = 260 nm,18
ρ0 = 2.33 × 103 kg/m3, cl = 9.33 × 103 m/s, cp =

Comparing Fig. 5 with Fig. 2(e) in Ref. 18 reveals
that the rates for phonon-induced relaxation of the res-
onant exchange qubit in Si are smaller than those for
GaAs by several orders of magnitude. For the ranges

where P and Q are the zero-photon and one-photon pro-

can re-express the master equation [Eq. (68)] in terms
of the subspace projections ρ00 ≡ P ρP, ρ11 ≡ QρQ,
ρ01 ≡ P ρQ, and ρ10 = ρ†01 = QρP of the density ma-
trix.
To simplify the analysis, we set ρ11 = 0, which amounts
to neglecting the contribution of the quantum jump term
κaρa† in Eq. (68) (this approximation is reasonable for
κ, g (cid:28) ˜∆). We also assume that the photon coherences
decay much more rapidly than the photon populations
and neglect the time evolution of the photon coherences
by setting ˙ρ01 = 0. Note that in the absence of decay,
setting this condition is equivalent to carrying out per-
turbation theory for the zero-photon subspace. From Eq.
(68), we then ﬁnd

Performing a mapping to a Liouville-space representation
[i.e., expressing the density matrix projections as vectors
and the superoperator terms in Eqs. (72) and (73) as
matrices] and setting ˙ρ01 = 0 enables ρ01 to be expressed
in terms of ρ00. Solving Eq. (72) with this relation sub-
stituted for ρ01 then yields an analytical solution for the
density matrix ρ00 (τ ) as a function of time τ.

In order to calculate the gate ﬁdelity, we choose as the

initial state of the system

ρ00 (0) = |e, g, 0(cid:105)(cid:104)e, g, 0| .

For the ideal evolution, described by setting γ = κ = 0

20.

for the initial state in Eq. (74). The gate error 1− Fd for
˜∆/g = 20 and n = 0 (i.e., at time τ0 = π ˜∆/2g2 = 10π/g)
is shown in Fig. 6 as a function of γ/g and κ/g, where
the chosen ranges of decay rates lie well within the strong
coupling regime described by γ/g < 1 and κ/g < 1. We
see that the error depends more sensitively on γ/g than
on κ/g, as is expected for the dispersive regime of RX
qubit-resonator coupling. For g = 2π × 9 MHz and ω0 =
2π × 1.5 GHz (see Sec. II), the chosen parameter values
correspond to ω = 2π × 1.3 GHz and the iSWAP gate
time τ0 = 540 ns, while gate ﬁdelities greater than 0.99
are expected for γ (cid:46) 2π × 0.9 kHz (or T ∗2
(cid:38) 170 µs)
and κ (cid:46) 2π × 90 kHz (or Q (cid:38) 1.6 × 104). These upper
bounds on γ and κ are consistent with the expectation
that gate ﬁdelities for the dispersive regime are limited
more by γ than by κ and suggest higher ﬁdelities for
systems in which the qubit coherence time is much longer
than the resonator photon coherence time. Finally, we
note that a controlled-NOT (CNOT) entangling gate can
be constructed using two iSWAP gates combined with
single-qubit rotations.72 As all single-qubit rotations for
RX qubits can be generated via exchange17,18 and τ0 (cid:29)
ω−1 ∼ 1 ns (see Sec. III B), we can estimate the total
CNOT gate time as τCNOT ∼ 2τ0 ∼ 1 µs.

B. Driven resonant regime

We now consider the driven resonant regime discussed
in Sec.
III B, in which two RX qubits are entangled
through sideband transitions generated by a combination
of microwave driving of the resonator and the individual
qubit-resonator interactions. As the sideband transitions
represent the main entangling mechanism involved in the
multi-gate sequence for the controlled-Z gate given in Eq.
(45), we focus on a single sideband transition in order to
obtain insight into the dependence of the entangling gate
ﬁdelity on the qubit and photon decay rates for the driven
resonant regime. We therefore estimate the ﬁdelity of a
sideband π pulse for one RX qubit coupled to the funda-

qubit dephasing and cavity decay with rates γ and κ,
respectively, we begin with the master equation

where α(cid:48) (t) = −εe−i(ντ +φ)/ (∆0 − iκ/2) is the steady-

For simplicity, we therefore calculate the ﬁdelity with re-
spect to the ideal density matrix evolution generated by
Eq. (85).

pared to the iSWAP gate in the dispersive regime (Fig.
6), the ﬁdelity for the sideband π pulse in the driven
resonant regime depends more sensitively on the pho-
ton decay rate κ/g, while the maximum error is approx-
imately one order of magnitude smaller over the same
range of γ/g and κ/g. The parameter values ∆0/g = 20,
g = 2π × 9 MHz, and ω0 = 2π × 1.5 GHz lead to
ω = 2π×1.3 GHz and the gate time τπ = 54 ns, which is a
factor of ten shorter than the iSWAP gate time τ0 found
in Sec. V A. From Fig. 7, gate ﬁdelities greater than

10.05.623.161.781.000.5620.3160.1780.1000.05620.03160.01780.0100Κg"10#30.010.050.10.5151010#510#40.0010.01Γg"10#31#Fr0.99 are expected for γ (cid:46) 2π × 9 kHz (or T ∗2
(cid:38) 17 µs)
and κ (cid:46) 2π × 51 kHz (or Q (cid:38) 2.9 × 104). Note that
the minimum value of T ∗2 is also reduced by a factor
of ten compared to that for the dispersive regime found
in Sec. V A, suggesting that (provided resonators with
suﬃciently high quality factors are available) sideband-
based entangling gates in the driven resonant regime may
prove more advantageous for implementations. In addi-
tion, an estimate of the controlled-Z gate time based on
the ﬁve sideband pulses appearing in Eq.
(45) yields
τCZ ∼ 5π/g ≈ 270 µs. As in the previous section, we
again neglect the rapid single-qubit exchange rotations
(see also Sec.
III B), which also serve to convert be-
tween the controlled-Z and CNOT gates. Thus, although
a controlled-Z gate in the driven resonant regime requires
more sideband pulses compared to the two iSWAP gates
needed for a CNOT gate in the dispersive regime, we
nevertheless ﬁnd that the total gate time τCZ (cid:28) τCNOT.

C. Driven dispersive regime

Finally, we consider the gate ﬁdelity for the driven dis-
persive regime (Sec. III C), in which both RX qubits are
again coupled to the resonator in the dispersive regime
(see Sec. V A), but with ωa (cid:54)= ωb and a microwave driving
ﬁeld applied to the resonator [see Sec. V B and the last
term of Eq. (28)]. The master equation in the presence

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In the present work, we have analyzed three approaches
drawn from a combination of circuit QED and Hartmann-
Hahn double resonance techniques for entangling spa-
tially separated RX qubits via a superconducting trans-
mission line resonator. We derived both the form of
the RX qubit-resonator coupling and resonator-mediated
entangling gates in the dispersive, driven resonant, and
driven dispersive regimes. While both dispersive regimes
yield two-qubit gate rates ∼ ξ4, where ξ ≡ t/∆ is the
charge admixture parameter for the RX qubit and is re-
lated to the qubit-resonator coupling strength via g ∼ ξ2,
rapid gates with rates ∼ ξ2 and smaller error are possible
in the driven resonant regime.
Our results show that an implementation of RX qubits
in silicon triple quantum dots in principle enables robust-
ness to phonon-induced relaxation and possesses charac-
teristics highly favorable for achieving the strong cou-
pling regime of interaction with the resonator. Further-
more, the analysis of gate ﬁdelities for the three regimes
we consider suggests that, while the requirements for
resonator quality factors are somewhat relaxed in the
dispersive regimes, high-ﬁdelity entangling gates based
on sideband transitions in the driven resonant regime

in combination with rapid (cid:0)τgate ∼ ω−1 (cid:46) 1 ns(cid:1) single-

qubit rotations via exchange may prove advantageous for
implementations with resonators of suﬃciently high qual-
ity factors. In particular, although ﬁve sideband pulses
are required to construct a controlled-Z gate according to
Eq. (45), we expect that the the total gate time should
still be considerably shorter than those for controlled-
NOT gates carried out using two iSWAP gates in the
dispersive and driven dispersive regimes. We therefore
ﬁnd that the exchange-based universal control intrinsic
to RX qubits enables rapid entangling gates in the driven
resonant regime.

Many potential future directions remain to be ex-
plored. Experiments will ultimately provide more insight
into the achievable coherence times, resonator quality
factors, and optimal coupling regime for entanglement
within the RX qubit-resonator system. Identifying meth-
ods for integrating this basic unit into a robust modu-
lar architecture also remains an open challenge. Addi-
tionally, while the focus of the present work is on so-
called transverse RX qubit-resonator dipole coupling of
the form σx
ing potential improvements in the performance of entan-
gling gates for RX qubits via longitudinal dipole coupling
of the form σz
of RX qubits in silicon will provide an opportunity to ver-
ify the expected improvements in coherence compared to
RX qubits in GaAs.

respectively, in units of the coupling strength g, calculated
using Eq. (8) for ∆0/g = 20 and δ/g = 4. Lines are guides
for the eye.

In Sec. III C, we showed that the iSWAP entangling
gate can be generated by the interaction in a doubly ro-
tating frame for 2 ˜Ωa = ˜δ [see Eq. (59)]. Setting 2Ω(cid:48)a = δ,
we incorporate this condition into the present analysis
via Eq. (58). We again take ρ00 (0) [Eq. (74)] as the
initial state of the system and obtain ρ(cid:48)00 (τ ) numerically.
Deﬁning g ≡ ga, setting ∆0/g = 20, and choosing the
iSWAP gate time

ρ00,id (τ0) ρ(cid:48)00,id (τ0)

≈ 0.999, indicating that
we ﬁnd Tr
for 2Ω(cid:48)a = δ and the
the evolution generated by H rot(cid:48)dd
constraint in Eq. (58) closely matches an ideal iSWAP
gate. Thus, we approximate the iSWAP gate ﬁdelity for
the driven dispersive regime by

Fdd (τ0) ≡ Tr(cid:2)ρ(cid:48)00,id (τ0) ρ(cid:48)00 (τ0)(cid:3) .

(103)
Figure 8 shows the error 1 − Fdd as a function of the
qubit and cavity decay rates γ/g and κ/g for ∆0/g = 20
and δ/g = 4. We note that, as in the dispersive regime
considered in Sec. V A, the error depends more sensi-
tively on γ/g than κ/g and is also larger than that for the
driven resonant regime. For ∆0/g = 20, g = 2π× 9 MHz,
and ω0 = 2π×1.5 GHz, we ﬁnd ω = 2π×1.3 GHz and the
iSWAP gate time τ0 = 3.0 µs. Gate ﬁdelities greater than
(cid:38) 310 µs)
0.99 correspond to γ (cid:46) 2π × 0.51 kHz (or T ∗2
and κ (cid:46) 2π×90 kHz (or Q (cid:38) 1.6×104). While the longer
gate time τ0 relative to that chosen in Sec. V A leads to a
longer minimum T ∗2 , we again ﬁnd that the gate ﬁdelity
should be higher for systems in which the coherence time
of the qubit is much longer than that of the resonator
photons, as is expected for the dispersive regime. Finally,
we use the approach described in Sec. V A to estimate
the total CNOT gate time as τCNOT ∼ 2τ0 ∼ 6 µs and
thus again ﬁnd that τCZ (cid:28) τCNOT (see Sec. V B).
