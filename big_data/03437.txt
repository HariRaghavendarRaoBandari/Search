ABSTRACT
This is the second in a series of papers aiming to test how the mass (MBH), accretion rate ( ˙M)
and spin (a∗) of super massive black holes (SMBHs) determine the observed properties of
type-I active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our project utilizes a sample of 39 unobscured AGN at
z (cid:39) 1.55 observed by VLT/X-shooter, selected to map a large range in MBH and L/LEdd and
covers the most prominent UV-optical (broad) emission lines, including Hα, Hβ, Mg II λ2798,
and C IV λ1549. This paper focuses on single-epoch, “virial” MBH determinations from broad
emission lines and examines the implications of different continuum modeling approaches
in line width measurements. We ﬁnd that using a local power-law continuum instead of a
physically-motivated thin disk continuum leads to only slight underestimation of the FWHM
of the lines and the associated MBH (FWHM). However, the line dispersion σline and associ-
ated MBH (σline) are strongly affected by the continuum placement and provides less reliable
mass estimates than FWHM-based methods. Our analysis shows that Hα, Hβ and Mg II can
be safely used for virial MBH estimation. The C IV line, on the other hand, is not reliable in
the majority of the cases, this may indicate that the gas emitting this line is not virialized.
While Hα and Hβ show very similar line widths, the mean FWHM(Mg II) is about 30% nar-
rower than FWHM(Hβ). We conﬁrm several recent suggestions to improve the accuracy in
C IV-based mass estimates, relying on other UV emission lines. Such improvements do not
reduce the scatter between C IV-based and Balmer-line-based mass estimates.

INTRODUCTION

The mass (MBH) of Super Massive Black Holes (SMBHs), along
with the SMBH spin (a∗) and accretion rate ( ˙M), are the funda-
mental parameters that drive the physical, geometric and kinematic
properties of the SMBH environment (e.g. Kaspi et al. 2005; Slone
& Netzer 2012; Capellupo et al. 2015). MBH is also known to be
correlated with several properties of the host galaxy, suggesting
a so-called “co-evolutionary” scenario for the SMBH and stellar
component of the host (e.g. Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Häring &
Rix 2004; Gültekin et al. 2009; Xiao et al. 2011). Therefore, accu-
rate and precise determinations of MBH, across cosmic epochs, are
crucial for our understanding of SMBH physics and evolution.

For un-obscured,

type-I actively growing SMBHs (active
galactic nuclei - AGN), MBH can be estimated from single epoch
spectra of several broad emission lines. The method, which was

used for many large samples of AGN across cosmic epochs (e.g.,
Croom et al. 2004; McLure & Dunlop 2004; Onken et al. 2004;
Fine et al. 2006; Shen et al. 2008; Raﬁee & Hall 2011; Trakht-
enbrot & Netzer 2012), is based on a combination of two basic
ingredients (Vestergaard 2002; Peterson et al. 2004). First, rever-
beration mapping (RM) experiments provide an empirical rela-
tion between the BLR size and the AGN continuum luminosity
(RBLR = K(cid:48)(λLλ)α, with α ∼ 0.5 − 0.7; see Kaspi et al. 2000,
2005; Bentz et al. 2009, 2013, and references therein). Second, the
gas in the broad line region (BLR) is assumed to be virialized (as
suggested by several empirical studies, e.g., Peterson & Wandel
1999; Onken et al. 2004) . After taking the line width of the BLR
lines as a natural estimation of the virial velocity of the gas in the
BLR (VBLR), one may obtain the mass from the virial relation:

MBH estimations to be consistent, on average, with those predicted
from the MBH-bulge stellar velocity dispersion (MBH-σ∗) relation
of local galaxies where MBH have been dynamically estimated (e.g.
Onken et al. 2004; Woo et al. 2010; Graham et al. 2011; Graham
2015; Woo et al. 2015). In this paper, we assume f = 1, which is
appropriate for the FWHM MBH (Hβ) estimates (Woo et al. 2015).
However, in addition to the still large uncentainty in this value
(50%), f can also be different for different lines and could even de-
pend on luminosity and/or line properties (e.g. equivalent widths,
line offsets FWHM Shen 2013).
Among the RM-based RBLR − L relations, the most reliable
one is the RBLR (Hβ)− L5100 relation, which is the only one based
on a large number of sources, with L5100 (cid:46) 1046 erg s−1. Thus, the
MBH determination based on other lines and luminosities at other
wavelengths needs to be re-calibrated to match MBH measurements
based on Hβ and L5100. Particularly, C IV λ1549, hereafter C IV,
(e.g. Vestergaard & Peterson 2006; Park et al. 2013), Mg II λ2798,
hereafter Mg II, (e.g. McLure & Jarvis 2002; Vestergaard & Os-
mer 2009; Wang et al. 2009; Trakhtenbrot et al. 2011; Shen & Liu
2012; Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012) and Hα (e.g. Greene & Ho
2005; Xiao et al. 2011; Shen & Liu 2012) have been re-calibrated
accordingly, and are widely used lines to determine MBH at high
redshifts.

Earlier MBH recalibrations based on Mg II and Hα have
showed good agreement and low scatter with Hβ-based MBH cali-
bration (Greene & Ho 2005; Xiao et al. 2011; Trakhtenbrot & Net-
zer 2012). However, MBH recalibrations using the C IV line are
more problematic, compared with those based on lower-ionization
lines. First, the correlation between the widths of C IV and the
other lines was shown to be weak, or indeed insigniﬁcant, and
to present a large scatter, in many AGN samples (e.g., Baskin &
Laor 2005; Netzer et al. 2007; Shang et al. 2007; Shen et al. 2008;
Fine et al. 2010; Ho et al. 2012; Shen & Liu 2012; Tilton & Shull
2013). Moreover, about 40% of the objects have FWHM (C IV) (cid:46)
FWHM (Hβ), in contrast to the expectations from RM experi-
ments and the virial assumption, that suggest FWHM (C IV) (cid:39)
2 × FWHM (Hβ) (see detailed discussion in TN12, and additional
samples in Ho et al. (2012); Shen & Liu (2012); Tilton & Shull
(2013)). Second, signiﬁcant blueshifts of the entire C IV proﬁle
(i.e., not necessarily a speciﬁc sub-component of the line), reaching
several 1000s km s−1, are ubiquitously measured in the vast major-
ity of AGN (Richards et al. 2002; Baskin & Laor 2005; Shang et al.
2007; Richards et al. 2011; Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012). Some of
these ﬁndings were explained either by a disc outﬂow wind (e.g.
Gaskell 1982; Sulentic et al. 2007; Richards et al. 2011) or, alter-
natively, by scattering off an in-falling medium in the innermost
C IV-emitting regions, which would produce the C IV blueshifts
(e.g. Kallman & Krolik 1986; Goosmann & Gaskell 2007; Gaskell
2009; Gaskell & Goosmann 2013). Finally, the detailed re-analysis
of the RM data for C IV performed by Denney (2012) found that
the (narrowest) core of the broad C IV line does not reverberate in
response to continuum variability. This implies that the outermost
C IV emitting regions may not be virialized, either. All this leads
to the conclusion that the simpliﬁed models and prescriptions dis-
cussed above may be incorrect, or at least incomplete, for some
lines.

The MBH determination is also subjected to several uncertain-
ties, related to the limitations of spectral analysis, and/or the need
to make several assumptions regarding the universality of some
AGN properties. The former includes the blending of neighbor-
ing emission and/or absorption features; incorrect determination of
the continuum emission (Shang et al. 2007, hereafter S07); poor

statistics due to non-homogeneous or small nature of the sample
under study (e.g. Ho et al. 2012); poor data quality (e.g., Den-
ney et al. 2013; Tilton & Shull 2013); and measurements obtained
from non-simultaneous data (see e.g. Shen & Liu 2012; Marziani
et al. 2013a). The latter, somewhat more fundamental uncertain-
ties, include non virial gas motion;
the orientation of the (gener-
ally non-spherical) BLR with respect to the line-of-sight (Runnoe
et al. 2014; Shen & Ho 2014; Brotherton et al. 2015); and the ex-
trapolation of the RBLR− L relations to luminosities which are well
beyond the range probed by RM experiments.

There have been many efforts to improve single-epoch MBH
determinations, addressing some of the aforementioned limitations
(e.g. Greene & Ho 2005; Vestergaard & Peterson 2006; Fine et al.
2008; Wang et al. 2009; Fine et al. 2010; Xiao et al. 2011; Shen
& Liu 2012; Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012; Marziani et al. 2013a;
Park et al. 2013; Runnoe et al. 2013; Brotherton et al. 2015; Zuo
et al. 2015). Trakhtenbrot & Netzer (2012, hereafter TN12) com-
bined Sloan digital sky survey archival data (SDSS; Abazajian
et al. 2009) with smaller surveys and samples to improve ear-
lier Mg II-based MBH prescriptions (e.g., McLure & Jarvis 2002;
McLure & Dunlop 2004; Wang et al. 2009), by assuming viri-
alization of the Mg II emitting clouds. As mentioned above, the
TN12 study emphasized the fact that a large fraction of AGN show
FWHM (C IV) < FWHM (Hβ). Marziani et al. (2013a) (hereafter
M13) also used SDSS data to perform an Eigenvector 1 analy-
sis (Boroson & Green 1992), and to separate the population into
“population A” (FWHM (Hβ) < 4000 km s−1) and “population
B” (FWHM (Hβ) > 4000 km s−1) sources. They suggested that
Hβ- and Mg II-based MBH estimates in population B sources could
be systematically overestimated due to a red-shifted, extremely
broad emission component. The study ofShen & Liu (2012) com-
bined SDSS optical observations of high-z objects (1.5(cid:46)z(cid:46)2.2)
with follow up FIRE-IR observations, which allowed them to com-
pare and recalibrate the C IV, Mg II, Hβ and Hα MBH relations
as well as contrast them with previous calibrations. While they
found that FWHM(Mg II) correlates well with the Balmer lines,
the FWHM(C IV) does not show such correlations and is not a reli-
able viral mass estimator. The Shen & Liu (2012) results are how-
ever subjected to low quality SDSS data, non homogeneous sample
selection and non simultaneous observations. Ho et al. (2012) ob-
tained simultaneous UV, optical and infrared X-Shooter spectra for
7 objects at 1.3 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 1.6, resulting in similar conclusions regard-
ing the usability of Mg II-based MBH estimates, and the limitations
associated with C IV.

The studies of (Denney et al. 2013, hereafter D13) and Tilton
& Shull (2013) claimed that in spectra of limited S/N and/or spec-
tral resolution, FWHM(C IV) measurements are underestimating
the “real” line widths, in objects with strong intrinsic absorption
features that cannot be deblended from the emission lines. This
would partially explains the TN12 ﬁnding that about 40% of the
objects shows FWHM(C IV)<FWHM(Hβ). However, objects with
no evidence of absorption features, and yet “intrinsic” line widths
with FWHM(C IV)<FWHM(Hβ) are known to exist (e.g., Corbin
& Boroson 1996). After correcting for intrinsic C IV absorption,
D13 claimed that although FWHM(C IV) still does not correlate
well with FWHM(Hβ), σ(C IV) shows a strong correlation with
σ(Hβ) and can safely be used for C IV based MBH determinations.
Based on these results, (Park et al. 2013) obtained high quality data
in 39 out of 45 objects of the RM experiments campaign and im-
proved the Vestergaard & Peterson (2006) C IV-based MBH estima-
tor based on the σ(C IV). Both D13 and (Park et al. 2013) used non
homogeneous and multi-epoch samples that could affect their re-

sults. In addition, σline measurements are highly dependent on the
continuum determination method (see discussion in (Peterson et al.
2004)).

Recently, Runnoe et al. (2013) (hereafter R13) and Brotherton
et al. (2015) used a sample of 85 low-redshift (0.03 < z < 1.4) and
low-luminosity (43.37 < log L5100 < 46.45) AGN with quasi-
simultaneous UV and optical spectra to propose a method to re-
habilitate C IV for MBH determination, based on a correlation that
they found between the Si IV+O IV]−C IV line peak intensity ratio
and the Hβ−C IV FWHM ratio. This allowed these authors to pre-
dict FWHM(Hβ) from measurements of the Si IV+O IV] emission.
These studies suggested that this correlation may be driven by the
so-called Eigenvector 1.

In this work, we use X-shooter high-quality observations that
combines simultaneous UV, optical and infrared spectroscopy of a
unique sample of AGN at z∼1.55, selected by both their MBH and
Eddington ratio, L/LEdd as described in Capellupo et al. (2015)
(hereafter paper I). Selecting objects at this redshift allows simul-
taneous observations of Hα, Hβ, Mg II and C IV which is optimal
for comparing the various mass determination methods. In Paper I,
we showed that the accretion-disk continuum of most of the objects
(25 out of 30) can be successfully modeled by a geometrically thin,
optically thick Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disks (Shakura & Sun-
yaev 1973, hereafter SS73) . The models were taken from Slone
& Netzer (2012) who include several improvements upon the SS73
model, such as GR effects and a detailed treatment of the Comp-
tonization in the disc atmosphere. Paper I shows that most earlier
attempts to ﬁt accretion disk (AD) spectra to AGNs failed because
of the limited wavelength coverage and/or non-simultaneous obser-
vations. The continuation of this work, that includes 9 more sources
and a more comprehensive analysis, is described in Capellupo et al.
(2016, in prep.), hereafter Paper III) which is published in this vol-
ume.

The purpose of the present paper is to evaluate BH mass mea-
surements based on different emission lines, as derived from our
unique sample of X-shooter spectra. We also aim to provide to the
community MBH correction factors that do not depend on the ex-
act shape of the underlying continuum. The paper is structured as
follows. In section 2 we describe the sample. In section 3 we ﬁrst
introduce the local and global
thin disk continuum approaches
and describe the ﬁtting procedures we follow to model the contin-
uum, emission lines, iron pseudo continuum and Balmer contin-
uum. In section 4 we present and discuss the main results and in
section 5 we list the main conclusions of our work. Throughout
this paper we assume a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with the following
values for the cosmological parameters: ΩΛ = 0.7, ΩM = 0.3 and
H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.

2 SAMPLE, DATA AND ANALYSIS

The analysis presented in this paper is based on a sample of lumi-
nous, type-I AGN in a narrow redshift range around z (cid:39) 1.55, for
which we have obtained high signal to noise (S/N) single epoch
spectroscopic observations using the X-Shooter instrument on the
Very Large Telescope. The 39 sources span a range in brightness
of iAB ∼ 16.8 − 20.9. The sample selection, data acquisition and
reduction for the 30 brightest sources were described in detail in
paper I, and information about 9 other sources, obtained in ESO
program 092.B-0613, is provided in Paper III. Here we only brieﬂy
highlight a few essential aspects.

The sample has been selected from the seventh data release

of the SDSS (Abazajian et al. 2009) to homogeneously map the
parameter space of MBH and L/LEdd. For the purposes of target
selection, these quantities were initially obtained by spectral ﬁtting
of the Mg II broad emission line in the SDSS spectra as part of the
large compilation described in TN12. In Figure. 1 we show MBH
vs L/LEdd using updated values calculated in this paper based on
the Hα broad emission line and following the procedure that we
describe in section 4.4.

At the chosen redshift range of the sample, X-Shooter covers
the rest-frame wavelength from about 1200Å to 9200Å. This broad
spectral coverage has allowed us, after correction for Galactic ex-
tinction, to successfully model and constrain the observed Spec-
tral Energy distributions (SEDs). As shown in Papers I and III, we
obtain satisfactory thin AD model ﬁts to 37 sources, 6 of which
require an intrinsic reddening correction for a satisfactory ﬁt. The
wide wavelength coverage, together with the homogeneous selec-
tion of the sample in the MBH − L/LEdd plane, enables us to test
the performance of the single epoch black hole mass estimators for
the Hα, Hβ, Mg II and C IV lines and estimate the systemic bias
induced when the physical SED is unknown.

In Figure 2 we show the the signal to noise ratios (S/N) for
our X-Shooter spectra, measured at the peaks of each of the main
emission lines under study, as well as at the corresponding contin-
uum bands, as a function of iAB. We note that, even in the spec-
tral region which overlaps with the available SDSS spectra, the X-
Shooter data provide a signiﬁcant improvement in terms of S/N
and spectral resolution (see an example in Fig. A1, described in
appendix §A). All the sources have fairly high S/N ((cid:38) 20) at
the peaks of the Mg II and C IV lines and the adjacent continuum
bands. However, this is not the case for Hα and Hβ. The contin-
uum bands adjacent to Hα are much noisier. Most of the objects
have S/N < 20, and for those with iAB > 18.5, the ratio is below
10. Nevertheless, we are able to obtain reliable Hα line measure-
ment because most objects have fairly high S/N at their Hα line
peak (34 out of 39 object have S/N (cid:38) 20 and all of them have

S/N (cid:38) 8 ). Moreover, the relevant continuum bands around Hα
have low levels of contamination from iron or other, unresolved
spectral features. Consequently, even a moderate continuum S/N
(i.e., (cid:38)3) is enough to have reliable Hα ﬁts. There are however 4
objects where S/N < 3 and their line measurements, especially
their FWHM(Hα) are somewhat uncertain.

Unfortunately, the Hβ line measurements are more problem-
atic. In addition to the fact that Hβ is the weakest of the lines of
interest, we can also see from Fig. 2 that the relevant continuum
band in 21 out of 39 objects have S/N (cid:46) 10, and 14 of them are
actually below S/N ∼ 5. Near infrared (NIR) telluric absorption
is another issue that could also crucially affect Hβ line measure-
ments. The spectral regions with known low atmospheric transmis-
sion in the NIR, between Å and between 13000Å to 15000Å typi-
cally translate to rest-frame bands at 4200-4500Å and 5300-5800Å
at the redshift of the sample. These bands are known to show strong
iron emission which are suppressed by such telluric absorption (see
the example spectrum in Fig. 3 around 4400 and 5500Å). The com-
bined effect of the telluric absorption and the limited S/N achieved
for the fainter sources severely affects the correct modeling of their
iron emission around Hβ. This, in turn, signiﬁcantly increases the
measurement uncertainties related to Hβ, ultimately making Hβ
measurements of faint objects less reliable.

Fortunately, the Hα line shows very similar proﬁles to Hβ
(e.g. Greene & Ho 2005) which is in accordance with the expected
radial ionization stratiﬁcation of the BLR (Kaspi et al. 2000). Based
on these results, we can probe several aspects related to the Hβ line
using the more reliable Hα measurements.

emission corresponding to the continuum, the blended iron fea-
tures, and the emission line components. All the spectral model-
ing is done by employing the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for
χ2 minimization, using the python based spectroscopic analysis
package pyspeckit (Ginsburg & Mirocha 2011). The ﬁtting is
preformed in the rest frame, after shifting the spectra using the im-
proved SDSS redshifts provided by Hewett & Wild (2010). We
chose to use these redshifts, instead of using the O III] λ5007 line
observed within the X-Shooter data, because of the limited quality
of the relevant data and modeling of the Hβ-O III] λ5007 spectral
region (see §2) and the weak or absent O III] λ5007 emission in
many of our sources.

3.1 Continuum Emission

We adopt here two different approaches to account for the contin-
uum emission of the AGN,which we refer to as the local and
global
(thin disk) continuum approaches. The local continuum
attempts to account for the usual approximation of the continuum
emission by a single power law when the observed spectrum is lim-
ited to a narrow wavelength range. The global
thin disk con-
tinuum, on the other hand, corresponds to the more physically-
motivated AD model, that was obtained through a Bayesian analy-
sis taking advantage of our wide spectral wavelength coverage (see
paper I). A comparison of the measurements obtained with both
approaches will allow us to quantify the possible bias imposed by
ignoring the real SED shape, when wide-enough wavelength cov-
erage is not available.

3.1.1 Local continuum approach and Biases

In this section we describe the analysis procedures we used to
model the X-Shooter spectra and to obtain continuum and line
emission measurements. We discuss separately the analysis of

The local continuum approach consists of separately ﬁtting the
continuum emission surrounding each of the lines of interest. For
every source in the sample, each of these continua is approximated

ther (1) weak line emission ﬂux such as the continuum window at

sion that affects continuum windows around 2600Å and 3000Å, as

these biases are in the direction of an overestimation of the con-

An additional bias comes from the shape of the SED, particu-
larly at the turn over of most spectra at around 1000-1500Å (exact
wavelengths depend on BM mass, spin and accretion rate, see Pa-
pers I and III). The simple power-law approximation to the SED
does not remain valid over this range and may lead to measurement
biases of the line proﬁle properties of C IV and Si IV+O IV] λ1400
(hereafter Si IV+O IV]). In this paper we use our AD SED ﬁttings
to quantify these biases.

3.1.2 Thin Disk continuum approach

The global AD approach is based on the best ﬁts from the thin-
accretion-disk continuum models obtained for each of the sources
in Papers I and III. For the analysis in this paper we do not consider
the two objects with no satisfactory ﬁts to the thin disk continuum
model.

As explained in paper I and III, the SEDs of the AD models
used in this work are determined by MBH, the accretion rate ( ˙M),
the spin (a∗) and the inclination of the disc with respect to the line-
of-sight (θ). We adopted a Bayesian procedure to ﬁt the thin AD
model spectra to the observed X-shooter SEDs. MBH and ˙M were
taken as priors with Gaussian distributions centered on the observed
values, obtained from Hα and L6200 measurements (following the
procedures described in this paper), and with standard deviations
of 0.3 and 0.2 dex, respectively.

Within the global continuum approach we also consider the
BC emission that peaks near the Balmer edge (3647Å) and grad-
ually decreases towards shorter wavelengths. The Balmer contin-
uum model we used is based on calculations of the photo-ionization

code ION (Netzer 2006) with an H-atom containing 40 levels, so-
lar abundances, hydrogen density of 1010cm−3, column density of
1023cm−2 and ionization parameter of 10−1.5. The exact shape is
insensitive to the exact value of these parameters and the normal-
ization is done by direct ﬁts to the observations.

An additional contribution to the continuum emission is due
to starlight, mostly at wavelengths longer than about 6000Å. For
our AGN sample such a contribution is marginal in 32 out of 39
objects and does not severely affect the continuum level and shape
of the AGN SED as discussed in paper I and III ( <3% at 6200Å
). For the 7 fainter objects we used the method described in paper
III which assumes a template from an 11 Gyr old stellar population
to model the host galaxy emission. The scale factor of the tem-
plate is determined from the ratio of the measured EW (Hα) and
the median value of the EW (Hα) distribution of the 29 brightest
objects, as discussed in paper III. The host galaxy contribution is
subtracted before the thin disk continuum ﬁtting for those objects
which require this correction. We ﬁnd that in this sub-sample the
host galaxy contribution is between 6% and 50% at 6200Å and
smaller than 3% at 3000Å. We also tested several stellar popula-
tions in the age range from 1 to 11 Gyr, but we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant
changes in the corrected spectrum (see paper III for details).

Finally, combining the X-Shooter spectra obtained by three
different arms (UV, Optical and NIR) may introduce additional un-
certainties. As explained in Paper I, in most cases, the overlap and
connection between the VIS and UVB arms are satisfactory, with
no need for further adjustments but this is not the case for the VIS-

NIR joint, as can be seen for J0043 in Fig. 3. For several objects, the
slope of the VIS arm was adjusted based on comparison to SDSS
(see Paper I for more details). We therefore allow our ﬁtting to
rescale the global continuum up to 10% in each of the regions
covered by each arm (1200-2200Å, 2200-4000Å, 4000-9000Å) to
take into account the arm calibration uncertainties.

3.2 Blended iron lines

For an adequate modeling of Hβ and Mg II line proﬁles it is cru-
cial to ﬁrst subtract the iron line emission, originating from a large
number of blended features of Fe II and Fe III. Generally, this is
done by choosing the best-ﬁt broadened, shifted and scaled empir-
ical iron line template. We constrain line center shifts to be smaller
than 1000 km s−1 and broadening is constrained to the range 1000-
20000 km s−1. For the optical region around Hβ (4000-7000Å) we
used the iron template from Boroson & Green (1992). For the UV
region around Mg II (1700-3647Å) we initially used the Tsuzuki
et al. (2006) template (hereafter T06). However, the ﬁts obtained
using this template was not satisfactory, mainly due to an over-
estimation of the continuum emission. We therefore built a new
iron template (see Apppendix B and ﬁgure B1) based on the spec-
trum of I Zw 1 reported by T06, which is a composite of their UV
(HST) observation and the optical (KPNO) observation reported by
Laor et al. (1997).

One of the main differences between the local and global ap-
proaches is that under the local approach different scaling factors

rately on each of the main emission line regions, while all the lines
in each line region are ﬁtted simultaneously.

Generally, the global (see Figure 3) and local (see Figure
4) continuum approaches follow the same line ﬁtting procedures
in terms of the number of components per emission line and the
way they are tied together. One important difference is that in the
global approach, the C III] and C IV line regions are considered
a single region and are therefore ﬁtted simultaneously. The reason
for this is that under the local approach we take as continuum
windows the region around 1700Å following the same procedure
of previous works (e.g., S07, TN12, and references therein). How-
ever, this region is usually contaminated by weak emission lines
like N IV1718, and consequently the thin disk continuum ﬁt does
not allow us to ﬁt C IV and C III] independently.

In order to account for possible uncertainties in our spec-
tral measurements, we performed 100 Monte-Carlo realizations for
each of the spectra. In each of these realizations, the ﬂux density at
each spectral pixel was altered from the observed value by a ran-
dom, normally distributed value, assuming the corresponding level
of noise (i.e., using the noise spectrum). From these sets of best-ﬁt
models we extracted, for each emission line, the line width FWHM,
the velocity dispersion (σline; following Peterson et al. (2004)), in-
tegrated luminosity (L), rest-frame equivalent width (EW), the lu-
minosity at the peak of the ﬁtted proﬁle (LP) as well as its corre-
sponding wavelength (λP) and the offset of the line center (relative
to the laboratory wavelength; ∆v). The line offsets were calcu-
lated using the ﬂux-weighted central wavelength of the broad line
proﬁle:

(cid:18)(cid:90)

(cid:19)

∆v =

λfλ (line) dλ/F (line) − λ0

c/λ0

(2)

where fλ (line) is the ﬂux density of the broad line pro-
ﬁle at λ; F (line) is the integrated broad line ﬂux, F (line) =

(cid:82) fλ (line) dλ ; λ0 is the laboratory wavelength of the line; and

c is the speed of light.

The best-ﬁt values for all these parameters were taken from the
medians of the parameter distribution, and the corresponding un-
certainties were estimated from the central 68% percentiles. This
“re-sampling” approach for the estimation of measurement-related
uncertainties was used in several recent studies of spectral decom-
position of AGN UV-optical spectra (e.g., Shen & Liu 2012). Based
on our experience, such errors reﬂect the true uncertainties related
to measuring emission line proﬁles, while those provided by the
(statistical) spectral ﬁtting procedure itself tend to underestimate
the “real” uncertainties.

for the UV iron template at each side of the Mg II line are required
in order to guarantee an acceptable match to the observed spectrum.
The scale factor in the red side of Mg II is found to be always larger
than the one for the blue side, but by no more than 10%. This type
of correction is not needed in the global approach, when the com-
plete continuum model (AD+BC) is considered. Given that under
local approach the BC cannot be accounted for directly and
the
that the BC is monotonically increasing from 2200 to 3647Å, we
suspect that the larger scale factor in the red side of Mg II might be
due to the BC and not to intrinsic changes in iron line emission.

3.3 Emission Line Measurements

local or global

For the emission line modeling we have followed a procedure sim-
ilar to the one described in TN12 (see their appendix C) and Shang
et al. (2007) In short, after removing the continuum emission (fol-
lowing either the
approaches) and the iron
template, we model the prominent broad emission lines with two
broad Gaussian components. We allow for a range of line widths
and shifts for each component, where the FWHM ranges between
1000 km s−1 and 10000 km s−1and the line shifts are limited to
+/ − 1000 km s−1 for the Hα, Hβ and Mg II lines, while for
the C IV line we allowed blue-shifts of up to -3000 km s−1. These
different choices are motivated by the ﬁndings of several earlier
studies (e.g., Vestergaard & Peterson (2006), S07, R13, Park et al.
(2013)). In the case of doublet lines (C IV and Mg II), we used 4
Gaussians, forcing the two broad and two narrower components to
have the same proﬁles and intensity, and the theoretical wavelength
separation. We ﬁxed the Mg II and C IV doublet intensity ratios to
1:1, suitable for optically thick line emission. For each of the Hα,
Hβ and C IV lines we have also included a third Gaussian compo-
nent when needed to account for the additional emission originating
from the narrow line region (NLR). Each of these narrow compo-
nents are modeled by a single Gaussian proﬁle, their FWHM is
constrained not to exceed 1300 km s−1, and their line centers are
tied to each other, with shifts of 400km s−1, at most. We chose not
to include a narrow component in the modeling of the Mg II and
C IV lines (as in, e.g., Wills et al. 1993; Sulentic et al. 2007), since
we found no signiﬁcant difference in the Mg II measurements (or ﬁt
quality) when trying to include it.1 For other, weaker emission lines
(including He II1640, N IV1718, Si III]1892) we used only a single
Gaussian component. These lines are not necessary for the purpose
of the present work except for limiting the continuum placement.
More accurate modeling of these lines will be a topic of the fourth
paper in this series.

All the Gaussian components we used are symmetric and de-
ﬁned by three parameters: peak ﬂux density, FWHM, and central
wavelength. We have made several simple, physically motivated
simplifying assumptions, in order to minimize the number of free
parameters: the Gaussian components of lines of the same species
were forced to share an identical width; we have also tied together
the relative shifts in the central wavelengths of some lines, based
on their laboratory wavelengths; and assume line-intensity ratios
for some lines based on their statistical weights (See Appendix D
and Table D1 for further details on the different emission line pa-
rameters, their assumed ranges, inter-connections and delimitation
of the emission line regions). Our line ﬁtting procedure runs sepa-

1 For example, for C IV we ﬁnd that a narrow component typically con-
tributes ∼ 3%, and at most 6%, of the total line luminosity.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Local versus global continuum measurements

In this subsection we compare the local and global contin-
uum approaches in order to quantify the possible biases that are
introduced when the real underlying shape of the continuum can-
not be accurately established. As we will describe below in de-
local continuum measurements
tail, our main conclusion is that
of FWHMs, continuum luminosities and, consequently, black hole
masses present very small but systematic offsets with respect to the
corresponding global continuum measurements.

4.1.1 Continuum biases

In ﬁgure 5 we present the comparison between Llocal and Lglobal
(top-left panel) for different chosen wavelengths. We generally ﬁnd
small but systematic offsets between quantities derived via the lo-
cal versus global approach. We ﬁnd that the L1450, L3000, L5100
and L6200 median offsets (∆L ≡ log (Lglobal/Llocal)) are typically
small ((cid:46) |−0.05| dex, see Table 4 for details). These offset are con-
sistent with a very subtle overestimation of the continuum emission
when the local approach is adopted (see Fig. 4 for a particular ex-
ample).

4.1.2 Line width biases

The systematic continuum overestimation that we found coming
from adopting the local instead of the global approach will nat-
urally lead to systematical FWHM underestimation as can be also
seen in Figure 5 (top-right panel). Indeed, all the relevant line width
measurements present small median offsets (∆FWHM ≡ log
FWHMglobal/FWHMlocal) smaller than (cid:46) 0.02 dex as can be seen in
Table. 4. As mentioned in §2 the measurements of FWHM(Hβ) are
more challenging for low S/N and/or objects where most iron emis-
sion is suppressed by telluric absorption. This explains the outliers
and large uncertainties for some objects in the FWHM(Hβ)local-
FWHM(Hβ)global plot. Except for these few outliers, the FWHMlocal
measurements of all the emission lines are proportional to, and
systematically but slightly smaller than the FWHMglobal measure-
ments.

When we perform the same analysis on the velocity disper-
sion σline (see the bottom-left panel in Fig. 5) we ﬁnd a large scatter
(∼ 0.14 dex) and usually weak, if any, correlations (P > 0.01)
between the local and global measurements in Hα, Mg II and
C IV. On the other hand, the Hβ line shows a much tighter cor-
relation (rs < 0.78, P = 2 × 10−9) but the scatter is still very

large (∼ 0.12 dex). These results indicate a strong and perhaps
non-linear dependency between the measured σline and the level of
its local continuum. As a result σline-based determinations of MBH
may be unreliable for data of limited spectral coverage. In particu-
lar, such estimates may suffer from higher systematic uncertainties
compared to those based on FWHM.

4.1.3 Black hole mass biases

In §§4.4 we will describe in detail the methods that we follow for
MBH calibration using the local and global approaches. The
form of the virial mass estimator (see Eqn. 1) indicates that biases
in MBH determinations are mainly driven by the (small) line width
biases. This is not the case for the continuum luminosity since one
can, in principle, re-calibrate the RBLR − L relations to use either
one of the local or global measured continuum luminosities, thus
completely eliminating the systematic biases.
After following the procedure described in §§4.4 and the strict
virial assumption (MBH ∝ FWHM2) we found that the MBH me-
dian offsets (∆MBH = log MBH, global/MBH, local) are in very good
agreement with our predictions, as can be seen in the bottom-right
panel of Figure 5 and are smaller than (cid:46)0.04 dex (see Table 4).
From the values listed in Table 4 and from a visual inspection of
Fig. 5 one can conclude that Hα, Mg II, and C IV are consistent
(within the scatter) with ∆MBH being independent of MBH. Hβ is
again a bit more complicated, due to the difﬁculties we mentioned
above. However, after removing the low-quality outliers we even-
tually ﬁnd Hβ to be consistent with ∆MBH being independent of
MBH. Among all the lines considered here, we ﬁnd Mg II to be the
local ap-
one showing the smallest biases when following the
proach . This is somewhat surprising, given the several important
spectral features (BC, FeII lines) that are inﬂuencing this spectral
region.

4.1.4 Line luminosity biases

Line luminosities are more sensitive to continuum placement than
the other quantities we examined. Indeed, we found line lumi-
nosity median offsets (∆Lline = log L (line)global /L (line)local) of
0.06+0.08−0.08 dex , 0.03+0.06−0.04 dex, 0.02+0.09−0.08 dex and 0.05+0.04−0.06 dex
for C IV, Mg II, Hβ and Hα, respectively. Furthermore, we ﬁnd
that the large scatter that is generally found in ∆LC IV, ∆LMg II,
∆LHβ and ∆LHα is due to the fact that these quantities are anti-
correlated with continuum luminosity. In particular, the relations
between these line luminosity biases and L5100 show rs correla-
tion coefﬁcients of -0.38, -0.44, -0.65 for C IV, Mg II, Hβ and Hα,
respectively. This implies that using the local approach to estimate
line luminosities generally leads to an underestimation of the latter,
and its effect is larger for low luminosity objects (up to 0.14 dex, or
38%, in the case of C IV).

In summary, the impact of using the

local approach to es-
timate the local luminosities, lines widths and black hole masses
when the global continuum is unknown is found to be small
local approach
(< 0.06 dex). However, the impact using the
to estimate line luminosities is found be luminosity dependent,
being stronger for low luminosity objects. The median values of
∆FWHM, ∆L, ∆MBH, and ∆Lline that we found are summarized
in Table 4. Based on the general good agreement between local
and global measurements and in order to provide the community
with strategies more applicable to observations with limited wave-

4.2 Luminosity Correlations

Figure 6 presents a comparison between L5100 and the luminos-
ity indicators most commonly used in the context of MBH esti-
mates. The best-ﬁt parameters of all the correlations can be found
in Table 5. These relations provide us with the links necessary
to connect each luminosity indicator and RBLR (Hβ), through the

periments (Kaspi et al. 2000, 2005; Bentz et al. 2009, 2013). For
the purposes of the present work, we use the same calibration as in
TN12, which is appropriate for sources with L5100 (cid:38) 1044 erg s−1:

L5100 and L3000-L5100). This may therefore contribute to an in-
creased uncertainty in L (Hα)-based determinations of MBH. This
is not surprising, given the expected range of conditions in the
BLR. Consequently, we also investigate use of L6200 as an alter-
native to L (Hα). As can be seen in Fig. 6 (cyan inverted trian-
gles) the L6200-L5100 relation shows an even smaller scatter than
L1450 and L3000. This is particularly the case for objects with
L5100 (cid:38) 1045 erg s−1, where host galaxy contribution is negligi-
ble.
L1450-L5100 and L3000-L5100 luminosity correlations are
supra-linear, in the sense of showing L ∝ Lβ
5100 and β > 1 (see
ﬁrst column of Table 5 and note that β = γ−1). This has been
noted earlier by Vanden Berk et al. (2004) but is in contrast to Shen
& Liu (2012) who found consistency with β = 1 in the sample of
high luminosity quasars (L5100

(cid:2)erg s−1(cid:3) > 1045.4).

While there are various correlations with MBH (Hα) and
L/LEdd (measured from Hα) that can, perhaps, explain these dif-
ferences, it is important to note that our sample is by no means
complete. It was chosen to sample the high-L z=1.55 AGN popu-
lation by giving equal weight to a group of sources with the same
MBH and L/LEdd (see paper I). Hence, the relationship found here
should be checked in a larger and complete sample that represents
the entire AGN population.

4.3 Line widths and line offsets

4.3.1 Comparison with SDSS data

At the redshift range of our sample, the archival SDSS spectroscopy
covers both the C IV and Mg II lines in 29 out of 39 objects.2 In
Figure. A1 we show an example of the SDSS and X-Shooter spectra
in the overlapping region. Comparing SDSS and X-shooter data
allow us to test the effects of having only survey-grade data, with
limited S/N and spectral resolution, on the measurement of line
widths. To this end, we used our C IV and Mg II ﬁtting code for the
lower quality archival SDSS DR7 spectra. In Fig. 7 we compare the
FWHM (top-panels) and σline (bottom-panels) values of the C IV
and Mg II lines obtained from the SDSS data, with those obtained
from our higher quality spectra under the local approach. We
also show the Spearman correlation coefﬁcients and corresponding
P -values in each panel.

We ﬁnd that SDSS-based FWHM(C IV) for objects with ab-
sorption features which are unresolved in the SDSS data (4 out of
29 objects, red symbols), or those with partially-observed proﬁles
because of the limited SDSS wavelength coverage (5 out of 29,
yellow symbols) result in FWHM measurements which are sys-
tematically different from those obtained from the higher quality
data. Speciﬁcally, while unresolved absorption features are likely
to result in a systematic underestimation of FWHM(C IV), by about
50 ± 10%, incomplete proﬁles are likely to lead to a systematic
overestimation of FWHM(C IV), by about 40 ± 20%. This result
was found in previous works (e.g. Denney et al. 2013; Park et al.
2013; Tilton & Shull 2013) and could explain, to some extent, the
over-population of narrow C IV objects that is reported in TN12.
The Mg II line does not generally show strong absorption features.
Indeed, we ﬁnd that the SDSS-based FWHM(Mg II) measurements
are generally consistent with our higher quality FWHM(Mg II)
measurements with the exception of ﬁve objects. Of these 5 ob-
jects, three have very low S/N, one has an incomplete proﬁle, and
one shows signs of absorption.

Looking into the corresponding comparison with σline (bottom
panels of Fig. 7), we generally ﬁnd that sources with absorption
features or incomplete proﬁles do not stand out from the “normal”
population. The entire sample shows considerable scatter when
comparing the SDSS and X-Shooter line measurements and show
less signifcant correlations than the FWHM(top panels of Fig. 7).
For σ (Mg II), we ﬁnd the SDSS measurements to be systemati-
cally broader than our σX-Shooter (Mg II) estimations, and the scat-
ter is larger than the one in the FWHM comparison. For σ (C IV),
there is a large dispersion (0.2 dex) between SDSS and X-Shooter
measurements, that could be caused by the high sensitivity of σline
measurements to continuum placement.

We conclude that the usage of σline to measure line width in
data of limited quality introduces signiﬁcant scatter. For such data,
the use of FWHM is preferred, especially for the Mg II line. In ad-
dition, the absorption features often seen in the C IV line necessitate
the use of high-quality spectra, in order to resolve and properly ac-
count for these features, even if one uses FWHM instead of σline.

4.3.2 Line Offsets

We measured the line offsets with respect to the laboratory wave-
lengths of Hα, Hβ and Mg II. Their absolute values (|∆v|) are

from the 2SLAQ survey, which is of limited S/N and is not ﬂux calibrated.

found to be (within the 16% and 84% percentiles) smaller than
600 km s−1, 550 km s−1 and 250 km s−1 respectively.

Many of the observed C IV lines show large negative veloc-
ity offsets (∆v (cid:39) −1200 ± 1000 km s−1) suggesting non virial
equilibrium of the C IV emitting clouds. This has been noted in
numerous earlier publications, (e.g. Shang et al. 2007; Wang et al.
2009; Shen & Liu 2012; Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012; Runnoe et al.
2013; Brotherton et al. 2015). Moreover, the C IV velocity offsets
are anti-correlated with L/LEdd (rs = −0.53, P = 0.0004), i.e.,

MNRAS in press, 000–000 (0000)

higher L/LEdd will translate into bluer line centers (e.g. Marziani
et al. 2006; Sulentic et al. 2007). We also ﬁnd that the much smaller
velocity offsets of the Mg II lines are also anti-correlated with
L/LEdd (rs = −0.49, P = 0.001) which is also in agreement with

malized accretion rate ( ˙m ≡ Lmodel/LEdd

analogous correlation with Mg II velocity offsets becomes insignif-
icant (P = 0.07). These results suggest that L/LEdd is playing an
important role in the line offsets of the C IV proﬁle, while Mg II
velocity offsets may involve additional parameters. As explained
earlier, the way we selected our sample makes it difﬁcult to make
strong statements regarding the entire population of AGN. When
the same analysis is done with the Balmer lines, we ﬁnd no corre-
lation between neither L/LEdd nor ˙m and the Balmer line velocity
offsets (P = 0.26 and P = 0.90, for Hα and Hβ, respectively).
We further conﬁrm earlier results (e.g., Corbin 1990; Richards et al.
2011) of a signiﬁcant anti-correlation between the C IV blueshifts
and the C IV line strength, EW(C IV) (rs = 0.43, P = 0.006), but
not with EW(Mg II) (rs = 0.25,P = 0.12).

Several studies investigated the possibility that broad emission
lines are gravitationally red-shifted by few hundred to few thou-
sand km s−1 (e.g. Netzer 1977; Zheng & Sulentic 1990; Popovic
et al. 1995; Müller & Wold 2006; Tremaine et al. 2014). This effect
is enhanced in very broad emission line components (FWHM (cid:38)
7000 km s−1) that are formed close to the BH. In this work we
made no attempt to include this in the modeling of the line proﬁles
since we are mainly after the line FWHM which is insensitive to
such small variations. We veriﬁed, however, that line offset due to
this effect are smaller than the general uncertainty and scatter asso-
ciated with our measurements of the line center velocity. We come
back to this issue in paper IV (Mejia-Restrepo et al, in preparation).

4.3.3 Line width correlations

3.7(cid:10)

Figure 8 presents a comparison between the widths of some
of the broad emission lines in our X-shooter observations, in
terms of FWHM (top panel) and line dispersion (σline; bot-
tom panel). For reference, we also illustrate the 1:1 relation
√
(black solid line), and a constant scaling of FWHM (C IV) =
3.7 FWHM (Hα, Hβ, Mg II) (black dashed line). The latter scal-
ing is motivated by the typical ratio of the corresponding BLR
sizes for Hβ and C IV, as measured in RM experiments, and
under the virialized BLR assumption (see detailed discussion in
TN12). We have plotted in yellow a dashed line that represents
FWHM (C IV) =
account for the median FWHM ratio between FWHM(Hβ) and the
FWHM of Hα and Mg II. Finally, we have color coded the points
in gray scale by the S/N of the continuum bands around Hβ where
darker colors translates into higher S/N. In Figures B2 and B3 of
the Appendix C we show the normalized Hα, Hβ, Mg II and C IV
observed line proﬁles in velocity space to provide the reader with
a direct visual comparison of the most prominent emission lines.
The large error bars in the Hβ line widths are due to the low signal
to noise and the difﬁculty of constraining the iron emission around
Hβ, because of the telluric absorption (see §2).

We also ﬁnd that objects with log FWHM (Hβ)(cid:2)km s−1(cid:3) ≤

We generally ﬁnd very good agreement between the FWHMs
of Hβ and Hα (Fig. 8 top-left panel). On average, FWHM(Hβ) is
broader than FWHM(Hα) by 0.03 dex (see blue dashed line in Fig.
8), with a scatter of about 0.08 dex. This result is in good agreement
with several previous studies, as well as with the scaling relation
reported in Greene & Ho (2005) (see red dashed line in Fig. 8).
3.6 (∼ 4000 km s−1) show FWHM(Hβ) slightly narrower than the
median trend (i.e. below the blue dashed line in Fig. 8) by about
0.04 dex (10%). These objects are however fainter and their values
are less accurate because of the difﬁculties with Hβ measurements.
This results is in agreement with Denney et al. (2009) where they
found that the estimated FWHM(Hβ) in low quality data (S/N (cid:46)
20) is not reliable.

From Fig. 8 we can also see that there are signiﬁcant cor-
relations between the FWHMs of: 1) Hα and Mg II (scatter of
σ∆ = 0.08 dex), 2) Hβ and Mg II (σ∆ = 0.10 dex) and 3) Hα and
Hβ (σ∆ = 0.07 dex) in agreement with several previous works
(e.g. Greene & Ho 2005; Shang et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009;
Shen & Liu 2012; Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012; Marziani et al.
2013a). Also, FWHM(Mg II) is proportional to and narrower than
FWHM(Hβ) by 0.16 dex (30%), with a scatter of about 0.08 dex
and no dependence on FWHM(Hβ). There are however some out-
liers in these general trends: The two BALQSOs (green dots in Fig.
8) and 5 objects that show FWHM (Mg II) (cid:38) FWHM (Hβ) and
have high L/LEdd (> 0.17, hereafter broad-Mg IIobjects, magenta
diamonds in Fig. 8). These 7 objects and their implications in the
FWHM(Mg II)-Balmer lines correlations are further discussed in
§4.3.4.

From the discussion above it is reasonable to assume that the
emissivity weighted Mg II region is more distant from the central
BH than the corresponding regions for the Hα and Hβ lines. On
the other hand, both Balmer lines seem to come from the same
part of the BLR. As a consequence and based on the FWHM linear
correlation among Hα,Hβ and Mg II, assuming virialization of Hβ
would reasonably imply virialization of Mg II and Hα.

The correlations of FWHM(C IV) with the measured FWHM
of the other lines are weaker, occasionally insigniﬁcant (i.e.
P>0.01) and non-linear: 1) Hα (rs = 0.48, P= 0.02, σ∆ = 0.14
dex), 2) Hβ (insigniﬁcant, P= 0.05) and 3)Mg II (rs = 0.50,
P= 0.001, σ∆ = 0.10 dex). This would mean that FWHM(C IV)
is not linearly proportional to the FWHM of Hα, Hβ and Mg II.
For example, FWHM (C IV) ∝ FWHM (Hα)1.41±0.50. Moreover,
when combining the results of the RM experiments (e.g. Kaspi et al.
2007) with the virial assumption, it is expected that the C IV line
would be broader than Hβ, by a factor of about
3.7. 3 In con-

trast, the vast majority of sources in our sample (35/39; 90%) show
FWHM (C IV) <
3.7 FWHM (Hβ) and one third of the sources
have FWHM(Hβ)>FWHM(C IV). These results indicate either a
non-virialized C IV emission region, or a very different ionization
structure for objects with low and high FWHM(Hβ).

Finally, when we compare the velocity dispersion (σline) be-
tween the lines of interest (bottom panels of Fig. 8) we only ﬁnd one
signiﬁcant correlation between FWHM(Mg II) and FWHM(C IV)
(rs = 0.43, P= 0.005) in the local approach. However, even this
correlation does not hold under the global approach (P = 0.36).
Due to the fact that the correlations between the FWHM of dif-
ferent lines are much tighter than the σline correlations (under both
continuum approaches), and the fact that σline is strongly affected
by ﬂux in the line wings, we choose to use the FWHM to estimate
MBH in the analysis that follows.

As discussed in §4.3 we found that Mg II proﬁles are generally
and systematically narrower than Hα and Hβ proﬁles. However,
the top right and top center panels of Fig. 8 show that around
4000km s−1) there are a handful of objects (magenta diamonds)
that show FWHM (Mg II) (cid:38) FWHM (Hα, Hβ) and were noted
earlier as “broad-Mg II objects”.

Marziani et al. (2013b) and Marziani et al. (2013a) pre-
sented a thorough Eigen-vector 1 analysis of the Mg II and Hβ
proﬁles following Sulentic et al. (2002) from an SDSS selected
sample of 680 quasars. Their classiﬁcation is based on the loca-
tion of type-I AGN in the Rop-FWHM(Hβ) plane where Rop =
L (Fe II (4750)) /L (Hβ). They claimed that the so called “Broad-
Mg II objects” belong to the extreme population A category (A3
and A4 according the their classiﬁcation, see Fig. 8 in Marziani
et al. (2013a)) and represents about 10% of the total population of
high luminosity AGN. These extreme population A objects have
narrow Hβ proﬁles (≤ 4000 km s−1) and the highest Rop val-
ues. They are also among the objects with the highest Eddington
ratios and largest velocity offsets. Unfortunately, our difﬁculties
to properly measure the Fe II emission around Hβ do not allow
us to measure Rop and test their assumptions. can however com-
pare their L/LEdd estimates to our Hα-based L/LEdd estimates
by applying a bolometric correction as described in TN12. As
can be seen in Figure. 1 all these objects occupy the top 20 per-
centile of the L/LEdd distribution in our sample (L/LEdd ≥ 0.20)
in agreement with Marziani et al. (2013a). The Broad-Mg II ob-
jects in our sample also show relatively large C IV and Mg II ve-
locity blue-shifts (top 20%, ∆vBroad-Mg II (C IV) (cid:46) −2200 km s−1,
∆vBroad-Mg II (Mg II) (cid:46) −200 km s−1) which is also in agreement
with Marziani et al. (2013a). We note however that broad-Mg II
objects are not the only ones that meet the mentioned conditions.

As can be seen in Figure 8, the BALQSOs in our sample show
exactly the opposite behavior. They show narrower Mg II proﬁles
than usual. Unfortunately, it is impossible to draw any conclusion
based on only two sources.
In Table 6 we present the median values and corresponding
scatter of Q≡ log (FWHM (line1) /FWHM (line2)) as well as the
Spearman correlation coefﬁcient between the FWHM of the listed
lines under two cases: a) including all objects in the analysis and
b) excluding the broad-Mg II and the BALQSOs from the analy-
sis. It can be seen in Table 6 and Fig. 8 that after removing these
outliers the FWHM correlations becomes tighter (i.e. rs increases)
and the Q factors remain almost unchanged. We emphasize that

this result is also true for FWHM(C IV)while the correlations be-
tween FWHM(C IV) and the FWHM of the Balmer lines approach
to linearity after removing such 7 objects. Consequently, for the
following MBH analysis we exclude both the 5 Broad-Mg II objects
and the two BALQSOs.

4.4 Black Hole Mass estimators

In this subsection we present the procedure we use to obtain, and
compare, different MBH estimates using the different line and con-
tinuum measurements. Our starting point, and the basis for all the
following correlations, is the sub-sample of 32 AGN obtained by
removing from the original sample 5 sources showing large dis-
crepancy between FWHM(Hβ) and FWHM(Mg II) (see §4.3.4)
and the two BALQSOs in the sample. A major aim is to ﬁnd a
practical strategy that will allow the identiﬁcation of sources that
are not suitable for accurate mass determination based on single
line and continuum measurement.

4.4.1 L5100 − RBLR (Hβ) relation and Hβ
Most present-day single epoch mass measurements are based on the
RBLR (Hβ)-Llocal
5100 relation, established through RM experiments
(see §1 and Eq.3). In this case Llocal
5100 is a local estimation of
the continuum and RBLR is obtained from the time lag of the re-
sponse of the Hβ line to (optical) continuum variations. This lag
is assumed to properly represent the emissivity weighted radius of
the broad Hβ line. MBH is obtained from equation 1 where both
FWHM (Hβ)local and Llocal
5100 are obtained using local continuum
measurements. These values can be used to obtain the "local" BH
mass estimate, MBHlocal. We can then use the expressions derived
in §4.2, and the various biases between the local and global L5100
and FWHM, to derive a global expression for MBH (Hβ).

We start by using the local MBH (Hβ) expression obtained by
TN12. This expression is most appropriate for our intermediate and
high luminosity AGN:

1044 erg s−1

MBH (Hβ)local = 5.26×106 M(cid:12)

103 km s−1
(4)
Obtaining the equivalent global expression is not trivial since we
need ﬁrst to ﬁnd a relation between RBLR measured from RM and
Lglobal
5100 and not simply use the recipe that connects local measure-
ments. However, we do not know Lglobal
5100 for the objects targeted by
RM campaigns and we have to rely on the scaling relation between
5100 and Lglobal
Llocal
5100 that we ﬁnd in this work (see table 5). Substituting
in Eq. 3 we get:

5100 relation to a RBLR (Hβ) vs Lglobal

(5)
It is important to note that we have simply re-scaled the empirical
RBLR (Hβ) vs Llocal
5100 relation that
is adjusted to predict the same RBLR measurements. Consequently,
we do not expect any systematic bias in MBH measurements com-
ing from intrinsic Lglobal
5100 biases. The bias between MBHlocal
and MBHglobal are simply the results of the intrinsic differences be-
tween the FWHMlocal and FWHMglobal (see §4.1). The small MBH
biases that we found are shown in the bottom right set of panels in
Figure 5.

values in this table are valid for L in units of 1044 erg s−1 and FWHM in units of 1000 km s−1. For these calibration we assume f = 1 which is appropriate
for FWHM MBH estimates.

4.4.2 Other lines

In order to calibrate Hα, Mg II and C IV line measurements to
match the MBH (Hβ) predictions we follow standard procedures
(e.g. McLure & Dunlop 2004; Vestergaard & Peterson 2006;
Trakhtenbrot & Netzer 2012) that basically rescale RBLR (L5100) to
RBLR (Lλ) (see Eqn. 3) and then rescale µ (λ) to MBH (Hβ) where
µ(λ) = G−1RBLR (Lλ) FWHM (line)2.

This approach assumes that MBH scales as FWHM2, which
follows from a virialization of the line emitting region. According

MNRAS in press, 000–000 (0000)

to the direct proportionality that we found between FWHM(Hβ),
FWHM(Hα) and FWHM(Mg II) (see 4.3), it will be enough to as-
sume virialization of the Hβ emitting region. We note that several
previous studies have instead allowed total freedom to the depen-
dence of MBH on FWHM (e.g., Shen & Liu 2012), instead of as-
suming a virial relation. However, there is no physical motivation
for this approach (except perhaps for C IV) apart from the attempt
to minimize residuals with regard to MBH (Hβ). We focus on iden-
tifying those sources which appear to represent the largest deviation
from virial equilibrium, and excluding them from the analysis. As

Figure 10. A comparison of MBH estimates from X-Shooter and SDSS spectra. We show the offsets in mass estimates, ∆ log MBH ≡
log (MBH (line) /MBH (Hα)), vs. the S/N of the continuum around Mg II ([S/N] (Mg II)) using SDSS (black dots) and X-Shooter (blue diamonds) data
for the Mg II (left panel) and C IV (right panel) lines. SDSS data with unresolved absorption features (red dots) or incomplete line proﬁles (yellow dots) are
also shown.

explained in §4.3.4, these are the ﬁve sources with the largest de-
viations between FWHM(Hβ) and FWHM(Mg II), that are mostly
small width (FWHM (Hβ) < 4000 km s−1), high L/LEdd ((cid:38) 0.17)
sources , and the two BALQSOs. In such cases MBH (Hα) and
MBH (Hβ) are the only methods providing reliable MBH determi-
nation.

The results of the rescaled single epoch MBH estimators based
on Hα, Hβ, Mg II and C IV in 32/39 sources are summarized in
Table 7 and shown in Figure 9 where the black solid lines rep-
resent the 1:1 relations. We also show the 7 removed sources;
BALQSOs in green and objects with discrepant FWHM(Hβ) and
FWHM(Mg II) in magenta.

Figure 9 shows that the main sources of scatter in all the MBH
relationships in the original sample are the above 7 sources. Re-
moving these objects leaves almost perfect correlations (rs > 0.85,
P < 10−12) between mass estimates based on Hα, Hβ and Mg II
and even C IV. In fact, the scatter in MBH (Hα)-MBH (Mg II) and
MBH (Hα)-MBH (C IV) is reduced from 0.23 to 0.15 dex and from
0.29 to 0.16 respectively for the L6200-FWHM(Hα) estimates. Un-
fortunately, it is not easy to identify and remove such objects from
a sample where only the C IV line region is observable. We come
back to this issue later in the paper.

The use of L (Hα) in Xiao et al. (2011), as well as other stud-
ies (e.g., Greene & Ho 2005), is motivated by the possibility of
host-light contribution to L6200, especially in low luminosity (low-
redshift) AGN. However, as previously mentioned (§3), most of our
objects have negligible host galaxy contamination, and we have ac-
counted for it in the few objects where it is relevant. Thus, we can
safely use L6200 for Hα-based MBH estimates. In table 7 we present
both L6200-FWHM(Hα) and L (Hα)-FWHM(Hα) MBH calibra-
tions.

In Figure 9 we also present the best-ﬁt relations that compare
our new mass prescriptions with previously published ones (black
dashed lines). Particularly we compared our new calibrations with

the TN12 Mg II-based calibration, the Xiao et al. (2011) Hα-based
calibration (an updated version of Greene & Ho (2005)) and the
Vestergaard & Peterson (2006) C IV-based calibration. We note that
these are somewhat simpliﬁed comparisons, as a proper analysis of
the deviation from each MBH calibration is not straightforward, due
to the usage of different f factors; different RBLR − L relations; as-
sumed cosmology; and even of ﬁtting procedures. Nevertheless, it
is evident from the diagram that the deviation from the earlier mass
estimates based on C IV are the largest among the three (bottom
panel of Fig. 9).

4.4.3 X-Shooter versus SDSS MBH estimates

In Fig. 10 we compare the MBH estimations using the (lower-
S/N) SDSS spectra and (higher S/N) X-Shooter spectra, by plot-
ting ∆ log MBH ≡ log (MBH (line) /MBH (Hα)) for Mg II and
C IV versus the S/N of the continuum around Mg II([S/N] (Mg II)).
We note that
the typical difference between the data sets is
(S/N )XSh (cid:39) 4 × (S/N )SDSS. As expected (see §4.3), objects
with unresolved absorption features or incomplete line proﬁles gen-
erally show the largest offsets in mass. Apart from these objects,
the scatter in MBH (C IV) and MBH (Mg II) estimates is indepen-
dent of the S/N. This is not surprising because of the good agree-
ment between X-Shooter- and SDSS-based FWHM(C IV) measure-
ments (see §4.3.1). We conclude that the scatter in Mg II- and C IV-
based mass estimates is dominated by intrinsic differences between
FWHM(Mg II)-FWHM(C IV) and FWHM(Hα) as well as between
L5100-L3000 and L6200.

4.5 The C IV line as a Black Hole mass estimator

As can be seen in Figure 8 and also mentioned in §§4.3, the width
of C IV shows only weak correlations (if at all) with the widths
of the other lines we study in this paper. This result together with

the signiﬁcant blue-shifts observed in the C IV line center (∆v =
−1200 ± 1000) make mass estimates based on the CIV line sig-
niﬁcantly more uncertain. However, In high-z objects (2 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 5)
C IV is the only prominent broad emission line that lies within the
optical window. It is therefore important to explore possibilities to
improve MBH determination by means of C IV. There have been al-
ready some attempts in this direction. For instance, Runnoe et al.
(2013) and Brotherton et al. (2015) claim a correlation between the
line peak ratio LP (Si IV + O IV] ) /LP (C IV) and the FWHM ra-
tio FWHM (C IV) /FWHM (Hβ) driven by Eigenvector 1 (Boro-
son & Green 1992) that would help to reduce the scatter in MBH
from 0.43 dex to 0.30 dex, Denney et al. (2013) propose that hav-
ing high quality spectra and using the velocity dispersion of the line
(σline), instead of FWHM, will lead to accurate MBH estimations.
However, Denney et al. (2013) sample is limited to only 6 objects
and our larger, high quality sample does not show any correlation
between σline (Hβ) and σline (C IV).

In the following section we test the Runnoe et al. (2013) sug-
gested relation as well as other relationships that can be used to
improve the C IV-based mass determination method.

4.5.1 Rehabilitating C IV?

In Table 8 we show the correlation coefﬁcient, correlation prob-
ability and scatter between LP (Si IV + O IV] ) /LP (C IV) and
FWHM (C IV) /FWHM (Hβ) as well as several other similar line
peak and FWHM ratios that are listed in the table. In Figure 11 we
compare such quantities.

As can be seen in table 8 and Fig. 11, we conﬁrm the cor-
relation reported by Runnoe et al. (2013), however with a lower
level of signiﬁcance and larger scatter. These differences may be
attributed to the the smaller size of our sample (39 objects here
vs. 85 in R13), and the somewhat lower S/N in the Hβ region
for the fainter sources in our sample, compared with R13. We can
also see in Table 8 and Fig. 11 that our best ﬁt relation between
LP (Si IV + O IV] ) /LP (C IV) and FWHM (C IV) /FWHM (Hβ)
(black solid line in top-middle panel) is in very good agreement
with the one presented in R13 (red dashed line in top-middle panel).

The conﬁrmation of the Runnoe et al. (2013) correlation, and
the new correlations reported here, should assist in rehabilitating
C IV for more reliable MBH measurements, by relying on the nearby
Si IV+O IV] and/or C III] emission lines. Even for those combina-
tions of observables which do not signiﬁcantly reduce the scatter in
MBH determinations, they provide an improvement in the accuracy
of rest-frame UV-based MBH estimations since these prescriptions
compensates the effect of L/LEdd in the C IV proﬁle.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This paper uses a unique sample of 39 type-I AGN observed by
X-Shooter and covering, uniformly, the MBH − L/LEdd plane at
z = 1.55 down to iAB ∼ 21 mag. Our sample allows for a compre-
hensive comparison between different luminosity probes and emis-
sion line measurements, for the prominent broad emission lines
Hα, Hβ, Mg II and C IV, which are commonly used for virial BH
mass estimates. Thanks to the broad spectral coverage we were also
able to test two approaches for continuum ﬁtting and test for possi-
ble biases in MBH determinations: a physically-motivated approach
based on ﬁtting an accretion disc model to each spectrum; and a
more practical approach which treats the continuum around each
prominent line as an independent power-law.

In summary, the main ﬁndings of this work are:

(i) Comparing the two continuum ﬁtting approaches, we ﬁnd
only small (although systemic) offsets in the derived line lumi-
nosities, local continua luminosities, and line FWHMs, and con-
sequently in MBH determinations (< 0.05 dex). This implies that a
precise modeling of the continuum emission is not crucial for MBH
determinations.

(ii) Line dispersion measurements (σline) are highly sensitive to
continuum modeling, and cannot be safely used for MBH determi-
nation, even for the well-studied Balmer lines and/or when high-
quality spectra of broad UV lines are available.

(iii) We corroborate that both the Hα and Hβ lines show very
similar FWHMs and can be consistently used for estimating MBH
based on the virial assumption.

(iv) The Mg II line width is found to follow that of Hβ, and,
generally, can be safely used for MBH estimations. Our new ob-
servations show that the MgII line is about 30±15% narrower
than Hβ(in FWHM). We also found that about 10% of the ob-
jects show atypically broad Mg II lines, with FWHM (Mg II) (cid:38)
FWHM (Hα). These Mg II proﬁles are also systematically blue-
shifted, probably due to non-virial dynamics, and further shown to

MNRAS in press, 000–000 (0000)

be not suitable for reliable MBH estimation (see §4.3.4 ). We note
that broad-Mg II objects can only be identiﬁed using additional in-
formation from one of the Balmer lines, which would in turn elim-
inate the necessity to identify them. Without any additional infor-
mation, such sources may be present in any sample of AGN.

(v) We ﬁnd that FWHM measurements for C IV in low-S/N
spectra are systematically underestimated, for objects with partially
resolved or unresolved C IV absorption features. We also ﬁnd and
that the FWHMs of Mg IIand the FWHMs of non-absorbed-C IV-
proﬁles are consistent in low- and high-S/N data sets. On the other
hand, the line dispersion measurements (σline) for both C IV and
Mg II proﬁles differ signiﬁcantly (a scatter of ∼ 0.2 dex).

(vi) We ﬁnd better agreement and lower dispersion between
L6200 and L5100 than between L (Hα) and L5100, especially for
high luminosity objects (L5100 > 1045erg s−1), and recommend to
use the L6200-FWHM(Hα) black hole mass calibration (Table 7)
for objects with an AGN-dominated continuum in this luminosity
range.

(vii) The considerable uncertainties associated with C IV-based
determination of MBH are not solely due to insufﬁcient spec-
tral resolution and/or S/N. They are more likely related to the
physics of the BLR. Our results are in agreement with some
earlier ﬁndings about the systematic uncertainties associated to
C IV. We found that
is strongly correlated with
FWHM (C IV) /FWHM (Hα) and with the velocity offset of the
C IV line. We stress, however, that these correlations show large
scatter and cannot practically assist in improving MBH (C IV) esti-
mates.

the L/LEdd

(viii) We conﬁrm the result of Runnoe et al. (2013), ﬁnding a
signiﬁcant correlation between the Si IV+O IV]/C IV line peak ra-
tio and FWHM(C IV)/FWHM(Hβ), which may in principle assist
rehabilitating C IV-based MBH determinations. Moreover, we ﬁnd
even stronger correlations associated with the C III]/C IV line peak
ratio. Although these empirical correlations do not signiﬁcantly re-
duce the scatter in MBH (C IV) estimates, we propose that their ap-
plication, whenever possible, would improve the accuracy of C IV-
based MBH determinations.

(ix) L/LEdd seems to affect the dynamics of the Mg II-emitting
region, especially in objects with extreme accretion rates (as
pointed out by Marziani et al. (2013a)).

(x) We provide new single epoch calibrations for MBH, based on

the FWHM of Hα, Hβ, Mg II and C IV.

(xi) We constructed a new (UV) iron template that aims to im-
prove on previous templates (Vestergaard & Wilkes 2001; Tsuzuki
et al. 2006), particularly in the region of ∼ 2200 − 3650 Å.

APPENDIX A: DEMONSTRATING THE QUALITY OF
X-SHOOTER SPECTRA

Figure A1. SDSS and X-Shooter spectra of J0143-0056. Both spectra have
been rescaled to avoid overlapping.

Figure A1 compares the newly obtained X-Shooter spectrum
(UVB+VIS arms) to the publicly available SDSS spectrum, for
J0143–0056 - the source shown in Figs. 3 and 4. This source has
a S/N (cid:39) 25 at 2000Å which lies in the middle of the S/N range
for the entire sample. Both spectra are presented without any bin-
ning or smoothing, including the residual sky and/or instrumental
features. We note the signiﬁcant improvements to S/N and spectral
resolution, as evident from the minor absorption feature on the blue
wing of the C III] λ1909 line. The broader spectral coverage allows
for a much more robust determination of the continuum level next
to the C IV and Mg II emission lines (i.e., L1450 and L3000. Obvi-
ously, the NIR arm of X-Shooter includes the Hβ and Hα spectral
regions (not shown here), which are unavailable in the SDSS data.

APPENDIX B: NEW UV IRON EMISSION TEMPLATE

In ﬁgure B1 we compare our new UV iron template with the
template of T06. The new template, covering 2200-3646Å and
with an intrinsic width of 900 km s−1, can be downloaded from
http://www.das.uchile.cl/~jemejia/feII_UV_
Mejia-Restrepo_et_al_2015_2200-3646AA.data

We prefer the use of our new template motivated by the fol-

lowing three reasons:

emission around 2100Å.

• The T06 template severely underestimates the continuum
• T06 modeled the BC continuum as a modiﬁed Black Body
following (Grandi 1982). This does not provide a good approxima-
tion to Balmer emission and we prefer templates based on photo-
ionization calculations.

template (black).

• The T06 template only extends between 2200Å and 3500Å.
However, there is still a remaining weaker but still non-negligible
contribution from iron emission up to the Balmer limit (3647Å).
The correct estimation of iron emission in this regions (3500Å to
3647Å) is crucial for estimating the emission by iron lines and to
prevent overestimation of the BC.

We constructed the template following T06 and VW01 proce-
dures and using our own estimations of the accretion-disk emission
and Balmer continua. We redeﬁned the accretion-disk-continuum
by manually selecting the continuum windows at ∼2100Å and
∼4200Å which account for the region where we require to ob-
tain the new iron template (2100-3647Å) . The Balmer continuum
model that we use is described in section 3.

Our template provides stronger iron emission, particularly in
the range of 2620-3500 Å, which is crucial for Mg II measurements.
This could be explained by our different Balmer continuum ap-
proach and disk continuum windows.

APPENDIX C: COMPARISON OF OBSERVED EMISSION
LINE PROFILES

In Figures B2 and B3 we show the normalized proﬁles of the Hα,
Hβ, Mg II and C IV emission lines, in velocity space. In most but
not all sources, the C IV proﬁles (red) are broader and blue shifted
with respect to the Hα and Hβ line proﬁles as discussed in §4.3.
The low ionization lines, Hα, Hα and Mg II, show similar shape
proﬁles. Hβ is generally slightly broader than Hα. Mg II is, on av-
erage, 30% narrower than Hβ. The ﬁve broad-Mg II objects (top-
row) show Mg II that are broader than Hα and Hβ. These Mg II
proﬁles are also slightly blue-shifted (about 300 km s−1) relative
to the Hβ line. The two BALQSOs are the last two objects of the
bottom row on the second set.

APPENDIX D: EMISSION LINE CONSTRAINTS

Table D1 lists the constraints on the emission line modeling for
each of the components in our ﬁtting procedure following Shang
et al. (2007) and Vanden Berk et al. (2004).
