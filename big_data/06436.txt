We study kinetic eﬀects responsible for the transition to relativistic self-induced transparency in
the interaction of a circularly-polarized laser-pulse with an overdense plasma and their relation to
hole-boring and ion acceleration. It is shown, using particle-in-cell simulations and an analysis of
separatrices in single-particle phase-space, that this transition is mediated by the complex interplay
of fast electron dynamics and ion motion at the initial stage of the interaction. It thus depends on
the ion charge-to-mass ratio and can be controlled by varying the laser temporal proﬁle. Moreover,
we ﬁnd a new regime in which a transition from relativistic transparency to hole-boring occurs
dynamically during the course of the interaction. It is shown that, for a ﬁxed laser intensity, this
dynamic transition regime allows optimal ion acceleration in terms of both energy and energy spread.

Modern ultra-high intensity laser technology has made
a new regime of laser-plasma interaction experimentally
accessible, that of relativistic optics. In this regime elec-
trons interacting with the laser-ﬁeld gain relativistic ve-
locities within an optical cycle and their motion becomes
highly non-linear. Exploiting the complex laser-plasma
interactions in this regime has led to a wealth of novel ap-
plications ranging from charged particle acceleration [1–
3] to sources of ultra-short radiation [4, 5].

It has long been recognized that in the relativistic op-
tics regime even the most basic properties of a plasma
such as its index of refraction are profoundly aﬀected
by nonlinearities in electron motion [6, 7].
In partic-
ular, the electron eﬀective mass increase due to its γ-
factor dependence on the laser normalized vector poten-
tial a0 = eA0/(mec) leads to an eﬀective increase of the
0/2 nc. Here me and −e are
critical density neﬀ
the electron mass and charge, respectively, c is the speed
of light in vacuum, 0 is the permittivity of free space
and nc = 0 me ω2
L/e2 is the classical critical density be-
yond which a plasma is nominally opaque to a laser pulse
with angular frequency ωL. This simple form for the rel-
ativistic critical density neﬀ
is only valid for circularly
c
polarized (CP) plane waves propagating in an inﬁnitely
long plasma [7]. This is the basis of the eﬀect known as
relativistic self-induced transparency (RSIT), in which
a relativistically intense laser pulse (a0 ≥ 1) can prop-
agate in a nominally overdense plasma. However, when
one considers a realistic laser-plasma interaction scenario
the situation is much more complicated. Several eﬀects
that occur at the plasma-vacuum interface have to be
taken into account [8–12] and RSIT has been the object
of intense studies culminating in its recent experimental
observation [13]. Determining the conditions for transi-
tion from the opaque to RSIT regime is of paramount
importance for laser-plasma physics as it determines the
eﬃciency of laser energy coupling to the plasma.
It is

also crucial for a wide range of applications, from the op-
timization of laser-driven ion sources [3, 14], to the fast
ignition concept in laser-driven fusion [15, 16] and high-
harmonic generation at the laser-plasma interface [4].

When the plasma is opaque (for large enough plasma
densities), for thick enough targets, the so-called laser-
driven hole-boring (HB) regime occurs [17–21]. In this
regime the radiation pressure of the reﬂected laser pulse
displaces electrons, creating a charge separation layer.
Subsequently, ions are accelerated in the associated elec-
trostatic ﬁeld and a double layer structure known as a
relativistic piston is formed, see Fig. 1(a). This structure
propagates at the constant hole-boring velocity vHB =

vp0/(1 + vp0/c), where vp0 = a0c/(cid:112)2mini0/(menc), mi

is the ion mass and ni0 is the ion plasma density. The
ion energy gain scales as EHB ∝ a2
0/n0, where n0 is the
electron plasma density, and thus there has been consid-
erable recent interest in operation of HB as close to the
threshold density for RSIT as possible [21–24].

In this Letter we show using Particle-In-Cell (PIC)
simulations that both electron kinetic and ion motion
eﬀects play a major role in determining the transition
threshold from RSIT to the HB regime in the interaction
of a relativistic CP laser pulse with a plasma. By study-
ing in detail the single electron separatrices for the mo-
tion close to the plasma-vacuum interface we show that
the transition occurs due to the interplay of fast electron
generation and changes in the electrostatic potential in-
duced by ion motion at the initial stage of the interaction.
Moreover, we uncover a new regime in which the transi-
tion from RSIT to HB occurs dynamically, i.e. during the
course of the interaction. This dynamic transition regime
is shown to strongly depend on kinetic eﬀects developing
in the early stage of laser-plasma interaction, and can
be controlled by varying the temporal proﬁle of the laser
pulse. Furthermore, it is shown that operating in this
dynamic transition regime is optimal for laser-driven ion

step is ∆t = 0.95 ∆x and 1000 macroparticles-per-cell
have been used.

The transition threshold between diﬀerent regimes is
determined by examining, for each simulation, two time-
series:
(i) the position of the pulse front xf (t), de-
ﬁned as the position of the point closest to the elec-
tron density peak for which the amplitude of the vec-
tor potential takes the value |a| = a0/2 [21], and
(cid:82) L/2
(ii) the time-evolution of the cross-correlation function
−L/2 dx ne(x, t)|a(x, t)|2 that measures
S(t) = n−1
the overlap of the laser pulse with plasma electrons [24].
We ﬁrst discuss the case of a hydrogen plasma irradi-
ated by a laser with amplitude a0 = 10 and ramp-up time
τr = 4 τL, where τL = 2π/ωL. In Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d),
we plot as a function of time and for diﬀerent n0 the posi-
tion of the pulse front xf and the cross-correlation func-
tion S, respectively. For n0 = 3.3, we observe that, after
an initial stage of duration (cid:39) τr during which a Doppler-
shifted standing wave is formed, the front propagation
velocity reaches a constant value vf (cid:39) vHB [Fig. 1(c)].
Moreover, S remains approximately constant for t > τr,
indicating that the overlap of the laser pulse with plasma
electrons is limited. This is characteristic of the HB
regime. For n = 2.7 nc on the other hand, the pulse
front propagates with a velocity vf which at large times
approaches the constant value vSIT obtained from simula-
tions with immobile ions and otherwise equal parameters.
In addition, S increases linearly after t = τr, implying
that the laser propagates through the electron plasma,
i.e., in the RSIT regime.

For intermediate densities, between these two clearly
deﬁned regimes of propagation, we observe a behavior
that has not been identiﬁed before. As an example, we
show the case n0 = 2.8 nc for which the front position
xf propagates initially with a velocity vf > vHB until
up to approximately t ∼ 9τL. After this time the front
velocity changes abruptly and matches closely the HB
velocity. The change in velocity between the initial and
ﬁnal stages of propagation, vf = 0.11 and vf = 0.09,
respectively, is subtle, and thus it is essential to exam-
ine S(t) in order to obtain more information about the
nature of propagation during the initial and ﬁnal stage.
In Fig. 1 we see that during the initial stage S grows
linearly, as is typical of the RSIT regime. However, for
t > 9τL this growth saturates and an almost constant
value of S is reached, as is typical of the HB regime.
This demonstrates the existence of a dynamic transition
from RSIT to HB. We have veriﬁed, through simulations
with the Eulerian Vlasov code veritas [26], that this dy-
namic transition regime is not an artefact due to limited
momentum-space resolution in the PIC simulations.

As we will show, the origin of this eﬀect lies in the
electron dynamics at the initial stage of the interaction
of the laser pulse with the plasma. In near-critical plas-
mas laser energy absorption can be signiﬁcant even with

acceleration, as it leads to a reduced energy dispersion of
the accelerated ions while maximizing their mean energy,
thus opening new paths to eﬃcient control of radiation
pressure acceleration of ions.

The transition from the HB (opaque) regime to RSIT is
investigated using 1D3P PIC simulations performed with
the code EPOCH [25]. The (a0,n0)-parameter plane was
scanned to locate the transition threshold for diﬀerent
values of the ion charge-to-mass ratio, see Fig. 1(b). The
simulation box extends from x = −L up to x = L, where
L = 200λL and λL = 2πc/ωL = 1 µm is the laser wave-
length. The hydrogen or helium plasma ﬁlls half of the
box with a constant electron density n0. The initial elec-
tron and ion temperatures are Ti = Te = 5 × 10−4 me c2,
respectively. The plasma slab is irradiated by a CP

CP pulses [12, 27]. The ponderomotive force of the laser
pulse accelerates electrons to velocities much larger than
the thermal plasma velocity. Some of these electrons
are trapped in the potential well formed by the charge-
separation electric ﬁeld. This drives electrons close to
the plasma-vacuum interface away from thermodynamic
equilibrium. In Ref. [12] it was shown that, for the case
of immobile ions, the escape of electrons from single par-
ticle separatrices at the plasma-vacuum interface is re-
sponsible for transition to RSIT. In particular, it was
demonstrated that the width of these separatrices de-
creases with decreasing density, thus explaining transi-
tion to RSIT as the initial plasma density decreases.

For the case of mobile ions the situation is more in-
volved since, as we will show, ion motion turns out to
play an important role in electron dynamics. In order to
understand the separatrices between the motion of elec-
trons which escape into the vacuum and electrons that
remain conﬁned, we transform the single particle Hamil-
ec2 − φ(x, t)
to a frame moving with the instantaneous front ve-
locity vf as determined by our numerical simulations.
Here, a(x, t) and φ(x, t) are the instantaneous vector and
scalar potential normalized to mec/e and mec2/e, respec-
tively, px is the electron momentum and H is normal-
ized to mec2. These potentials are not available ana-
lytically and have to be determined from our PIC sim-
ulations. The Lorentz transformed Hamiltonian reads
¯H = γf
f /c2)−1/2.
We assume that in the frame moving with velocity vf the
variation of the potentials due to ion motion is slow com-
pared to the typical timescale for electron motion. Thus,
¯H can be treated as time-independent and the separatri-
ces for electron motion are determined as iso-contours of
¯H associated with its local minima. These separatrices
are plotted in Fig. 2 for the three diﬀerent regimes of
Fig. 1.

In the RSIT regime [n0 = 2.7 nc, Fig. 2(e,f)], electron
bunches escape to the vacuum region during the initial
stage of interaction. The escaping electron density is
large enough to signiﬁcantly reduce the electrostatic ﬁeld
and as a result ions remain relatively immobile. The re-
duction of the charge separation ﬁeld prevents an equilib-
rium between the ponderomotive and electrostatic force.
Thus, the laser pulse propagates as the ponderomotive
force pushes electrons deeper into the plasma. We note
that for later times the quasistatic approximation does
not hold and no separatrix is plotted in Fig. 2(f). By
contrast, in the HB regime [n0 = 3.3 nc, Fig. 2(a,b)] the
separatrix is wide enough that no electrons escape to the
vacuum during the initial stage of laser-plasma interac-
tion. With time, ions respond to the electrostatic ﬁeld,
a double layer is formed and starts propagating deeper
into the plasma as a relativistic piston. At the same time
the separatrix becomes wider in px as ions catch up with
the electrons [Fig. 2(b)], reducing charge separation and

contributing to the stability of the HB process.

In the dynamic transition regime (n0 = 2.8 nc), our
approach highlights a hybrid behavior, see Fig. 2(c,d).
In the early interaction stage, electrons escape towards
the vacuum and the pulse propagates as in the RSIT
regime. However, in this case, the escaping electron den-
sity is not large enough to suppress ion motion. When
the latter sets in, the electrostatic ﬁeld is reduced and the
width of the separatrices for electron motion increases
with time. The potential well becomes deeper prevent-
ing further electrons from escaping. This explains why
after a transient period in the RSIT regime, a relativistic
piston is formed that propagates into the plasma with ve-
locity vHB. For completeness, we note that for even larger
laser ﬁeld amplitudes (a0 ≥ 20), the plasma dynamics in
the dynamic transition regime can be even more complex
and a transition may also occur in the reverse direction,
from HB to RSIT. This dynamical behavior remains be-
yond the scope of this work.

We have thus shown that the interplay of electron and

ion motion plays an important role in the transition from
the RSIT to the HB regime, especially when such a tran-
sition occurs dynamically. One would thus expect that
the ion charge-to-mass ratio aﬀects these transitions. In-
deed, we show in Fig. 1(b) that for a given a0 the HB
regime extents to smaller n0 for hydrogen than for he-
lium, as was also observed in previous numerical simula-
tions [21]. Our study of the dynamic transition regime
allows us to understand the reason: protons respond
much faster to the charge seperation ﬁeld than helium
ions leading to quicker saturation of electron escape.

Since kinetic eﬀects in the early phase of interaction
play an important role in the transition between the dif-
ferent regimes, we can, to some extent, control the tran-
sition by varying the shape of the laser pulse. The pon-
deromotive force associated to a pulse with a shorter rise
time is larger than for one with a longer rise time and
this is expected to lead to stronger electron heating. In
order to illustrate this, we choose ﬁxed values of a0 = 10
and n0 = 3 nc and perform simulations with diﬀerent
laser pulse rise times τr = 4, 7 and 10τL. In Fig. 3 we
show that for shorter values of τr the pulse propagates
in the RSIT regime, while as τr increases the dynamic
transition and ﬁnally the HB regime is reached. The re-
lation of this eﬀect to electron heating is illustrated in
Fig. 4(a), where it is shown that indeed electron spec-
tra in the case of shorter rise time are broader than for
longer rise times. Moreover, it was veriﬁed by plotting
the single electron motion separatrices (not shown) that
the transition mechanism is identical to that of Fig. 2.

Beyond its fundamental interest, the dynamic transi-
tion regime reported here is also interesting when consid-
ering the properties of the accelerated ions. Indeed, HB
in near-critical plasmas is plagued by relatively broad
ion spectra, see Fig. 4(b) for an example with a0 = 10,
n0 = 2.7 nc and τr = 12τL. This broadening of the spec-
trum is usually attributed to periodic oscillations of the
double layer, known as piston oscillations. The oscillat-

ing electrostatic ﬁeld leads to ion bunching and modu-
lation of the ion beam in x − px phase space [28–30].
Piston oscillations disappear as the plasma density in-
creases, but at the expense of the mean energy of the
ion beam EHB ∝ a2
0/n0. Operating in the dynamic tran-
sition regime allows a spectrum with low energy spread
to be obtained without sacriﬁcing mean energy. This
is illustrated in Fig. 4(b), where a typical spectrum in
this regime is shown (here for a0 = 10, n0 = 2.7 nc and
τr = 7τL). The peak energy E = 15.6 MeV is very close
to the analytical prediction for HB, EHB = 15.8 MeV,
and the energy spread (1 MeV or 6% FWHM) is much
smaller than in the pure HB regime. This reduced en-
ergy spread is a result of the irregular nature of the piston
oscillations in the dynamic transition regime, see Supple-
mental Material
[30]. Some of the electrons that escape
into the vacuum during the initial stage interact with
the Doppler shifted standing wave and form energetic
bunches which return to the plasma leading to further
fast electron generation, see Fig. 4(a) and [30]. As a
result the electronstatic ﬁeld oscillations are highly ir-
regular and do not signiﬁcantly contribute to coherent
acceleration or deceleration of the fast ions. This leads
to smaller energy spread in the fast ion spectrum.

In summary, we have shown that the transition be-
tween the RSIT and hole-boring regimes can be trig-
gered by fast electron generation during the initial stage
of laser-plasma interaction. This transition can occur
dynamically and thus in certain cases RSIT has to be
thought of as a time-dependent problem.
Ion dynam-
ics is found to play an important role in the transition
to RSIT, while at the same time electron dynamics cru-
cially aﬀects the properties of accelerated ions. For a
given laser pulse amplitude a0, operation in the dynamic
transition regime allows for an optimal spectrum both in
terms of mean energy and energy spread. However, this
regime is characterised by complex dynamics and in real-
istic scenarios further complicating factors such as trans-
verse instabilities may play a role. Recently developed

ity science, such as those that rely on genetic algorithms
to control adaptive optics [31], suggest that there is a
potential to operate laser-driven ion acceleration in the
dynamic transition regime despite the inherently complex
dynamics. These results are of fundamental importance
for our understanding of relativistic laser-plasma inter-
action and for a wide-range of applications, from particle
acceleration to fast ignition, as they open new paths, for
example for the optimization of laser-driven ion beams.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL

We present two movies which elucidate the relation
between piston oscillations and ion spectrum. Movie 1
(ft.nephy.chalmers.se/resource/movie1 HB.avi) demon-
strates the HB regime and corresponds to a0 = 10,
n0 = 2.7 nth, τr = 12τL and hydrogen plasma. Movie
(ft.nephy.chalmers.se/resource/movie2 dynamic.avi)
2
shows the dynamic transition regime for the same
parameters except τr = 7τL. The vertical black line
represents the position of the pulse front and the visual-
ization box moves with vf . Only part of the simulation
domain is plotted, for clarity. In these movies |a| is the
magnitude of the normalized vector potential and the
electric ﬁeld Ex is normalized to Ec = me c ωL/e.
