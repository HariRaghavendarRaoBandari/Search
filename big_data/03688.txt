The ground states of square lattice two-dimensional antiferromagnets with anisotropy in an ex-
ternal magnetic ﬁeld are determined using Monte Carlo simulations and compared to theoretical
analysis. We ﬁnd a new phase in between the spin-ﬂop and spiral phase that shows strong simi-
larity to skyrmions in ferromagnetic thin ﬁlms. We show that this phase arises as a result of the
competition between Zeeman and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction energies of the magnetic sys-
tem. Moreover, we ﬁnd that isolated (anti-)skyrmions are stabilized in ﬁnite-sized systems, even
at higher temperatures. The existence of thermodynamically stable skyrmions in square-lattice
antiferromagnets provides an appealing alternative over skyrmions in ferromagnets as data carriers.

INTRODUCTION

Skyrmions have been the topic of intense research, in
ferromagnetic materials[1–9] as well as numerous other
systems[10–15]. Skyrmions in ferromagnets have promis-
ing characteristics that make them suitable for data stor-
age and transfer:
they can be driven by low critical
currents[16, 17], and they are able to move past pinning
sites[18].

Skyrmions in antiferromagnetic thin ﬁlms are per-
haps more suitable as data carriers than their ferro-
magnetic counterparts. Firstly, antiferromagnets are
more prevalent in nature than ferromagnets, allowing
for a wider range of material properties.
Secondly,
skyrmions in an antiferromagnet are less sensitive to mag-
netic ﬁelds. Thirdly, they move faster, and in the di-
rection of the charge current (while skyrmions in fer-
romagnets experience a Magnus force with a signiﬁ-
cant component perpendicular to their trajectory), which
makes it easier to control them[19–21]. For these rea-
sons, skyrmions have been investigated in many diﬀer-
ent antiferromagnetic systems both experimentally and
theoretically[22], ranging from doped bulk materials[23],
Bose-Einstein condensates[24], various triangular lattice
antiferromagnets[25, 26], and nanodisks[27].

In this manuscript we study inhomogeneous mag-
netization textures in square-lattice antiferromagnets
(SLA’s) with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions.
The DM interactions that we consider arise either from
bulk inversion asymmetry (symmetry class Cnv) or from
structural inversion asymmetry along the thin-ﬁlm nor-
mal direction. An example of the latter is an interface
between a magnetic metallic system and a non-magnetic
metal with strong spin-orbit coupling. For ferromagnetic
systems, tunable interface-induced DM couplings have
indeed been demonstrated[28–34]. Such interfaces typi-
cally also give rise to perpendicular anisotropies, which
we therefore also take into account. Finally, we also con-
sider an external magnetic ﬁeld normal to the thin ﬁlm.
Previous work by Bogdanov et al.[22] considered the same

system at zero temperature and in the continuum limit.
These authors identiﬁed three phases: an antiferromag-
netic phase, a spin-ﬂop phase, and a phase where inho-
mogeneous structures persist. While examples of struc-
tures in the latter phase were given, no further phase
boundaries were identiﬁed within this phase. One of our
main results is that we ﬁnd a distinct phase pocket that
bounds a 2q skyrmionic phase and separates it from a
spiral (1q) phase. Furthermore, we also conﬁrm the ex-
istence of stable skyrmions in ﬁnite-sized systems below
the Curie temperature.

The paper is organized as follows: ﬁrst, we present the
system under study, by deﬁning the hamiltonian that is
used in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. After that, we
discuss the various spin textures and their characteris-
tics that arise in SLA’s. We also construct the phase
diagram from MC simulations, complemented by analyt-
ical results based on a continuum model. We dedicate the
last two sections to the interaction energies of skyrmions,
and to skyrmions in ﬁnite-sized systems, respectively, af-
ter which we conclude with a discussion and summary of
our results.

MODEL

We are interested in the equilibrium spin conﬁgura-
tions in ﬁlms of SLA materials. For this purpose, we
consider a square lattice of length L in the xy-plane with
Heisenberg spins Sr of unit length at position r. Nearest
neighboring spins are coupled through an antiferromag-
netic Heisenberg term J > 0 and a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
term D and are aﬀected by anisotropy K and an external
magnetic ﬁeld B in the ˆz-direction. The eﬀective hamil-

tonian that is used in our MC simulations is given by

H =JXr

(Sr · ˆz)2 − BXr
(Sr × Sr+ˆx · ˆy − Sr × Sr+ˆy · ˆx) .

For theoretical analysis, we consider a continuous ﬁeld
description of the discrete hamiltonian in Eq. (1) (see
also Ref.
[9]). Because of the antiferromagnetic nature
of these materials, it is natural to deﬁne sublattices with
magnetization m1 and m2 organized in a checkerboard
conﬁguration and put the lattice constant to unity. For
antiferromagnets with large Heisenberg interaction we
expect slowly varying periodic structures and the stag-
gered magnetization l = (m1 − m2)/2 to be large while
the total magnetization m = (m1 + m2)/2 is expected to
be much smaller, ie, |l| ≈ 1 and |m| ≪ |l|[35]. We also
assume that the spatial derivatives of m can be neglected
and that the contribution of the total magnetization to
the anisotropic term is negligible compared to that of
the staggered magnetization. This results in the follow-
ing hamiltonian density

Since spins are normalized to unity, such that |mi| = 1,
the staggered and total magnetization must satisfy m2 +
l2 = 1 and m · l = 0 and minimizing the hamiltonian
density results in m = −l × (l × h)/(8J). Substitution
leads to a hamiltonian density that is only dependent on
the staggered magnetization:

We focus on systems for which the DM coupling and
the coupling to the magnetic ﬁeld are of the order of the
Heisenberg coupling but assume that anisotropy strength
is small. For small ﬁelds all higher order interactions like
dipole-dipole interactions are negligible in antiferromag-
nets because the net magnetization is small.

PHASES

We ﬁnd that systems described by the hamiltonian
given by Eq. (1) have four distinct phases at zero tem-
perature: the antiferromagnetic and spin-ﬂop phase are
both homogeneous, whereas the spiral and 2q phases are
modulated, i.e., inhomogeneous phases with 1 and 2 dom-
inating wave modes respectively.

There are two homogeneous phases: the antiferromag-
netic phase in which the staggered magnetization points
along the z-axis, and the spin-ﬂop phase in which the
staggered magnetization lies in the xy-plane. The spiral
phase emerges for large enough DM coupling for which
the staggered magnetization shows the same character-
istics as ferromagnetic spins in a spiral state. Finally,
there is a bounded region for which the 2q phase emerges,
which has a similar texture to the spiral phase but in
which the width of the spirals varies in length period-
ically. Conﬁgurations of these phases in real space, in
terms of the staggered magnetization, and the norm of
their Fourier modes are shown in Fig. 1. The Fourier
modes are deﬁned as

PHASE DIAGRAM FROM SIMULATIONS

In one elementary move of our MC simulations, a ran-
dom spin is selected and replaced by a new spin vec-
tor, drawn uniformly from a spherical cap around the
original spin vector. The size of this cap is chosen such
that the acceptance rate in the Metropolis algorithm is
roughly 50%. The time step is deﬁned such that each
spin makes an elementary move once per unit of time.
At each temperature typically 4500 time steps are taken
before measurements are done. During annealing, the

temperature is reduced from well above the critical tem-
perature to well below it in 200 temperature steps. These
measurements result in data obtained over a wide range
of parameters and temperatures.

We consider the Fourier transform of the spin vectors
as deﬁned by Eq. (4) below. All four phases can be char-
acterized by Fourier peaks. We deﬁne the homogeneous,
spiral, and 2q phases as having 1, 2, or 4 nonzero-mode
peaks respectively. To construct the phase diagram from
Monte Carlo simulations based on the discrete hamilto-
nian from Eq. (1) we ﬁrst anneal 10 diﬀerent systems

(1). The antiferromagnetic (a), spin-ﬂop (b), spiral (c), and 2q phase (d) are shown from left to right in typical real spin
conﬁguration (top) and staggered magnetization (middle) for an antiferromagnetic system of size L = 32 at zero temperature.
The arrows represent the local magnetization in the xy-plane and the background colour shows the magnetization pointing

of size L = 32 at some parameter values J, D, B, and
K. From these states the one with the lowest energy is
chosen, and the process is repeated for diﬀerent param-
eter values. For all these prospective ground states the
phase and the area in the phase diagram for which they
have the lowest energy is determined. From this the B-
D-phase diagram can be constructed for various values of
anisotropy K. The phase diagrams are qualitatively dif-
ferent for systems with easy-axis (K < 0) or easy-plane
(K > 0) anisotropy, as can be seen in Fig. 2.

ANALYTICAL PHASE DIAGRAM

We also construct the phase diagram by using a num-
ber of Ansätze for the various phases. The param-
eters in these Ansätze are obtained from minimizing
the hamiltonian density from Eq. (3) for these phases.

This yields the transition line following Bogdanov et
al [22]. For the antiferromagnetic phase we assume l =
(0, 0, 1), resulting in an energy density HAF = K. The
spin-ﬂop phase is characterized by l = (cos φ, sin φ, 0)
with energy density HSF = −B2/(16J). For the spi-
ral phase, l is dominated by a rotation along the di-
rection of the wave in the (1, 1) direction such that
l = (sin(q · r) cos θ, sin(q · r) sin θ, cos(q · r)). Averag-
ing over the length of one modulation and minimizing
with respect to q leads to an energy density HSP =
−B2/(32J) − D2/(2J) + K/2. A phase transition be-
tween the antiferromagnetic and spiral, and the spin-ﬂop
and spiral phase occurs along the lines

B = 4p−(JK ± D2),

(5)

for easy-axis anisotropy. For easy-plane anisotropy, we
assume for the spiral phase that the length is also vari-
able,
l = l(sin(q · r) cos θ, sin(q · r) sin θ, cos(q ·

i.e.,

r)). Following the same procedure, we ﬁnd that l =

√B2 + 8D2 − 8JK/B minimizes the energy. The en-
ergy density for the spiral is HSP = −(B2 + 8D2 −
8JK)2/(32B2J).
In the case of easy-plane anisotropy,
the phase transition between the spiral and spin-ﬂop

phase is then given by

B = 2q2(1 + √2)pD2 − JK.

We could not ﬁnd such a simple Ansatz for the 2q phase.

Carlo simulations were performed. From these simulations, the phases were determined, shown as diﬀerent colours. The red
data points show the boundary of the 2q phase, as obtained from these MC simulations for ﬁxed values of B/J. The analytical
solutions for the phase transitions as given by Eqs. (5-6) are shown as solid black lines.

We have constructed similar phase diagrams for vari-
ous strengths of anisotropy K/J ∈ 0,±0.02,±0.04,±0.1.
The critical strengths B0 at D = 0 and D0 at B = 0 at
which the transitions take place are obtained from Eqs.
√JK. These
become larger for increasing strengths of anisotropy. In
the simulations, the size of the system limits the longest
wave length of the magnetization texture. For larger
anisotropy, simulations in ﬁnite sytems are therefore in
better agreement with analytical calculations. An inter-
esting point is that the 2q phase is always sandwiched
between the spin-ﬂop and spiral phase, at constant val-
ues of DM interaction.
Its size is relatively insensitive
to the strength of anisotropy. This implies that the size
of modulations in the 2q phase in antiferromagnets is re-
lated to the pitch length p ∼ J/D, which is a measure
for the length of modulation. Therefore, p only has a
limited range of values, unlike the size of skyrmions in
ferromagnets.

interactions in the model along a line with ﬁxed B/J =
3.2, through the 2q phase in the phase diagram. With
increasing DM interaction and no anisotropy, there is a
transition from the spin-ﬂop phase to the 2q phase at
D/J = 0.76. If the DM interaction is increased further,
the spiral phase is entered at D/J = 0.84, as can be seen
in Fig. 3. At the phase transition the contributions of
the external ﬁeld B and the DM interaction D to the
total energy make distinctive jumps. While the spin-ﬂop
state minimizes the energy by having a net magnetization
along the external ﬁeld direction, the spiral mode makes
optimal use of the DM interaction. The 2q phase gives a
compromise between the two, and so a ﬁnite area between
the two emerges in which neither of them is optimal, and
the 2q phase prevails.

INTERACTION ENERGIES

To investigate further the stability of the 2q phase in
this model, we look at the energy contributions E of all

An important question is whether the objects in the 2q
phase as shown in Fig. 1 can be called skyrmions, as they
are not fully isolated topological objects. For a ferromag-
net, the (anti)skyrmion is deﬁned as a topological object

SKYRMIONS

5

a skyrmion and an antiskyrmion, and neither the up or
down regime in terms of the staggered magnetization is
favoured over long distances. Thus there can be no lattice
of isolated thermally-activated topological objects like in
a ferromagnetic system, without breaking this symmetry.

In ﬁnite-size systems with open boundaries, skyrmions
can, however, be stable as the boundaries break the sub-
lattice symmetry. We ﬁnd that skyrmions in ﬁnite-sized
systems persist even if the temperature is increased up
to the Curie temperature. To show this, we investigate
a single skyrmion in a small system of size L = 8 with
open boundaries at D/J = 1, B/J = 4 and K = 0, deep
in the 2q phase (see inset of Fig. 4(a)). The system
size is chosen as the maximum size at which at most one
skyrmion forms. Starting well above the critical temper-
ature we anneal the system as discussed above. Due to
sublattice symmetry, the system gets trapped in a state
with either a skyrmion or an antiskyrmion in the center.
From the susceptibility χw = hw2i − hwi2 of the wind-
ing number of the staggered magnetization, which is at
a minimum at the critical temperature β−1
c ≡ kBTc/J,
we ﬁnd βc ≈ 3.9. Results from 104 annealings allow for
an accurate picture of the expected number of skyrmions
in this system at a certain temperature. In particular,
we determine the probability density ρ(w, T ) for a value
w of the winding number at temperature T . Results for
χw and ρ(w, T ) are shown in Fig. 4. Within margins
of error, the system contains roughly half of the time
(49.54 ± 1.0%) a skyrmion instead of an antiskyrmion,
as expected from symmetry arguments for temperatures
below the critical temperature. Notice that the wind-
ing number is not exactly an integer due to edge eﬀects.
In short, this shows that (anti)skyrmions as stable iso-
lated topological objects can exist in ﬁnite-sized systems
at temperatures below the Curie temperature.

Figure 3. The energy contributions E/J to the ground state
of the interactions with coupling parameters J, D, B, and K
are shown as a function of D/J at parameter values J = −1,
B = 3.2, and K = 0 for system of size L = 32. The sys-
tem undergoes two phase transitions at D/J = 0.76 and
D/J = 0.84 between the spin-ﬂop, 2q, and spiral phase, re-
spectively. These are depicted as vertical grey lines. The
discrete jumps in various energy contributions suggest ﬁrst-
order phase transitions.

for which the winding number w of the magnetization is
nonzero:

w =

1

4π Z dxdy n · (∂xn × ∂yn) .

(7)

In case of the antiferromagnet, the winding number w
of the staggered magnetization can be deﬁned instead.
Although the staggered magnetization in an antiferro-
magnet behaves similarly as the normal magnetization
in a ferromagnet there are some distinctive diﬀerences.
The antiferromagnet is symmetric under the n → −n
transformation, such that there is no diﬀerence between

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In summary we have shown that certain types of an-
tiferromagnetic thin ﬁlms have four phases at zero tem-
perature including a 2q phase which was not reported
before. With Monte Carlo simulations and Fourier anal-
ysis, we constructed a phase diagram. The 2q phase
has close relations to skyrmions in ferromagnetic sys-
tems, but due to symmetries a lattice of topologically
isolated objects is not expected. We have shown however,
that in ﬁnite-sized systems and at nonzero temperatures
(anti-)skyrmions can be thermodynamically stable con-
ﬁgurations. The existence of thermodynamically stable
skyrmions in SLAs provides an appealing alternative over
skyrmions in ferromagnets as data carriers.

To address ﬁnite-size eﬀects and eﬀects of periodic

boundaries, we veriﬁed that for smaller systems of size
L = 16 the phase diagram is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent.
At very low B and D ﬁnite-size eﬀects are stronger as
long-wave-length modulated states do not ﬁt into the
small systems anymore. For parameters yielding the 2q
phase, we veriﬁed that the conclusions presented above,
which were obtained for systems of size L = 32, still hold
if the system size is increased to L = 128. We also veriﬁed
that helical boundaries with a shift up to half a period
of the 2q phase only result in a rotation of the q-vector
but otherwise do not aﬀect the phase diagram.

Since stabilizing the 2q phase requires large ﬁelds
B ∼ J, the best candidates for experimental veriﬁca-
tion are antiferromagnets with low critical temperature
Tc ∼ J/kB so that the required ﬁelds can be more eas-
ily achieved. A possibility for experimental observation
would be a monolayer of an antiferromagnetic compound

ilar to the experiments with Fe[9] in which temperature
and ﬁelds have similar energy scales.

In future work we intend to study quantum ﬂuctua-
tions of the ground states in the phase diagram, and
how the antiferromagnetic textures interact with spin and
heat current.
