We evaluate quantum gravity corrections to the standard model Higgs potential V (φ)
a la Coleman-Weinberg and examine the stability question of V (φ) at scales of Planck
mass MPl. We compute the gravity one-loop corrections by using the momentum cut-oﬀ
in Einstein gravity. The gravity corrections aﬀect the potential in a signiﬁcant manner
for the value of Λ = (1 − 3)MPl. In view of reducing the UV cut-oﬀ dependence we also
make a similar study in the R2 gravity.

Keywords: Higgs potential, Coleman-Weinberg, Planck scales, cut oﬀ method, R2 gravity

1. Introduction

It is curious that the mass of the Higgs boson mH (= 125.09 ± 0.24 GeV), which
has recently been discovered at LHC, lies far outside of the mass bound derived
from the one-loop radiative corrections 1,2. This bound arises from the stability
condition on the Higgs quartic coupling λ, i.e. λ(µ) > 0. The large two-loop
corrections come into play and the renormalization group (RG) ﬂow of λ changes
drastically. The ﬂow is also tangled with the top quark mass mt. Some ﬁne-
tuning of the parameters, especially that of mt, yield the λ barely in accord with
the boundary values of the stability bound extended to the scales of Planck mass
MPl. 3–5 It implies an interesting possibility that the standard model may be the
correct uniﬁcation theory all the way up to the Planck scales MPl. 6–8 This scenario
is consistent with the so far vain results of the susy particle search at the LHC
experiment.

It is a common belief that quantum gravity eﬀects should manifest itself at
Planck scales, irrespectively of the correct quantum theory of gravity. Hence it is
a very urgent problem to study whether incorporating quantum gravity corrections
may change drastically the RG analyses with the matter loop corrections alone. 9–11
In this paper, we calculate the gravity loop corrections to the Higgs potential
V (φ) and examine the property of the Higgs potential at Planck scales MPl. In the
Einstein gravity, we have found that there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
Higgs potential with and without gravity corrections. In the previous works, 9,10
the gravity loop corrections to the φ6 and φ8 terms are studied. We consider all
such corrections on the RG analysis of V (φ). This talk contains a brief summary

2. Gravitational Coleman-Weinberg corrections

In the standard model (SM), one- and two-loop contributions to the bare Higgs
mass and the bare couplings have been studied in details. 3–5 We take into account
the gravity one-loop eﬀects in addition to the matter loop eﬀects and will see how
two contributions compete in the energy region of Planck mass scales MPl.

We derive the Higgs eﬀective potential V (φ) in the Einstein’s gravity theory, by
extending the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism 13 to gravity loops 9,10,14. We begin
by writing the action for the Higgs ﬁeld H and the metric gµν

H † = 1/√2 (σ1 − i π1, φ + σ2 − i π2) and gµν = ηµν + κhµν, we evaluate the gravity

We adjust the value of m2(mt) so that Veﬀ (φ) gives correct the vacuum, v =

Fig. 2. RG ﬂow of λ(µ) and Veﬀ (φ) at φ ∼ MPl These curves correspond to top mass values
mt = 174, 173, 172GeV in thick and color order, Green, Red, Blue.

The inﬂuence of the gravitational corrections to λ(µ) and V (φ) is very small,

the λ(µ) and V (φ) are consistent with those in SM, at µ, φ < (O)(1017)GeV.

i) µ-dependence of λ

Gravity corrections are noticeable around µ = O(1018GeV), having the eﬀect
of increasing the value of λ rapidly, as seen in the Fig2. This behavior stops at
µ = (0.9 ∼ 1.0)× MPl, and they start to decrease λ sharply. λ becomes negative at
µ ∼ MPl.
ii) V (φ) near φ ∼ MPl
Regarding V (φ), gravitational eﬀects begin to be noticeable at φ = O(1018GeV),
φ6 and φ8 terms become dominant. φ < MPl, V (φ) is increasing and is positive.
φ ∼ (0.8 ∼ 0.9) × MPl, V (φ) begins to fall. It stops falling at φ = 1.1 × MPl, and
takes the minimum there. At φ ∼ 1020GeV and larger, V (φ) is rapidly increasing.
However, at such large values of φ, more higher loop eﬀects will be dominant, one
cannot say anything reliable about graviton loop corrections.
iii) Λ dependence of V (φ)

At φ ∼ MPl or larger, φ6and φ8 terms are signiﬁcant but they depend on the
cut-oﬀ value Λ, as shown in Fig 3. V (φ) takes the minimum for each cut-oﬀ Λ =
1 × MPl, 2 × MPl, 3 × MPl. One may safely say that Veﬀ (φ) takes a minimum;

Fig. 3. Veﬀ (φ) at φ ∼ MPl, mH =
125.09GeV, mt = 173.21GeV and Λ =
3MPl, 2MPl, MPl in thick order. The
vertical axis is on the position of φ =
MPl.

the depth of the minimum depends strongly on the cut-oﬀ value Λ, however. The
value of φ at the minimum (φm) increases proportion ally to cut-oﬀ Λ. However Λ
dependence of φm is mild, φm stays around MPl. Hence, V (φ) takes the minimum
at φ < Λ except the case of Λ = 1 × MPl.

4. Gravity corrections in R2 gravity

We have evaluated the quantum gravity corrections to Higgs potential V (φ) in the
Einstein gravity in the cut-oﬀ method. The resulting V (φ) apparently depends on
the cut-oﬀ Λ. It is desirable to study the gravity corrections in some UV renor-
malizable modiﬁed gravity, so that they have no Λ dependence or at most mild Λ
dependence. One modest approach is to take R2 gravity and evaluate R2 gravity
C-W corrections to V (φ). A diﬀerent approach has been taken in an early work 14.
A certain R2 gravity, i.e. the action of R2 term +(Rµν)2 term is known to be UV
renormalizable. 18,19 R2 term alone may not be renormalizable but the UV diver-
gence behavior is mild, and this theory tentatively serves our purpose.

The diﬀerence between the propagator of the R2 gravity and the Einstein gravity
is the presence or absence of the second term at (11). Due to the second term of
the propagator, we get the UV ﬁnite 1-loop eﬀects about φ6 term

As expected, the cut-oﬀ Λ does not appear. The same remark may not hold true
for φ8 and higher terms.

5. Conclusions

Evaluating the quantum gravity corrections to the Higgs potential V (φ) in the
Einstein gravity in the cut-oﬀ method, we have found a salient diﬀerence between

V (φ) with and without gravity corrections in the region φ & MPl. V (φ) with gravity
corrections takes a minimum at φ ∼ MPl, while V (φ) without gravity corrections
monotonically increases. V (φ) depends on the cut-oﬀ scales, because the Einstein
gravity is not renormalizable. As seen in Fig 3, Λ dependence of the depth of the
minimum of V (φ) is strong. Whereas, the value of φ at the minimum depends
weakly on the value of Λ, the minimum exists regardless of the cut-oﬀ scales. We
may safely guess that qualitatively due to gravity corrections, the Higgs potential
takes the minimum around the φ ∼ MPl.
There is a possibility of that Higgs potential does not depend on the cut-oﬀ scales
if we consider some modiﬁed theories of gravity. In a simple case of R2 gravity (
without (Rµν )2 term), the φ6 term correction does not depend on Λ.
