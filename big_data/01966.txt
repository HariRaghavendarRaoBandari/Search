Electronic transport in single-helical protein molecules: Eﬀects of multiple charge

conduction pathways and helical symmetry

Condensed Matter Physics Division, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, 1/AF, Bidhannagar, Kolkata 700 064, India

Sourav Kundu∗ and S. N. Karmakar

We propose a tight-binding model to investigate electronic transport properties of single helical
protein molecules incorporating both the helical symmetry and the possibility of multiple charge
transfer pathways. Our study reveals that due to existence of both the multiple charge transfer
pathways and helical symmetry, the transport properties are quite rigid under inﬂuence of envi-
ronmental ﬂuctuations which indicates that these biomolecules can serve as better alternatives in
nanoelectronic devices than its other biological counterparts e.g., single-stranded DNA.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Current days biomolecules are receiving huge attention
from diﬀerent scientiﬁc communities including physics,
chemistry and others because of their possible applica-
tions in nanoelctronics and the need of understanding
electronic (spin) transfer process in biological systems [1–
4]. DNA is one of them which has attracted major atten-
tion from the beginning of the last decade [5–9]. Whereas
other biomolecules such as proteins are less attended in
this respect. However with the recent progress in chiral-
induced spin selectivity (CISS) both DNA and protein
are getting similar attraction [10–22] across various dis-
ciplines as they both have helical structures which can
be used for eﬃcient spin polarization.
In 2011 G¨ohler
et al. [10] showed that double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA)
can be used as a good spin ﬁltering agent with length
dependent spin polarization up to 60%. Whereas no spin
polarization was achieved for single-stranded DNA (ss-
DNA). These ﬁndings are then theoretically supported
by Guo et al.
[12]. But recent experiments suggest
that α-helical proteins are also quite eﬃcient in spin
polarization process though it has single helical struc-
ture [21, 22]. These results open up an opportunity to
examine these single-helical structures from a new as-
pect, diﬀerent models are also proposed to explain these
experimental results [14]. In respect of electronic trans-
port properties DNA is widely studied, though there are
still controversies over diﬀerent experimental results [7–
9, 23–26]. Questions are still remain on reproducibility
of the experimental data and underlying charge trans-
fer mechanism [27–33]. Whereas the same properties of
diﬀerent protein molecules are less examined. There are
few number of reports available in literature on the elec-
tronic transfer process in proteins [34–38] but no such re-
port on the eﬀects of environment on its electronic trans-
port properties. It is conﬁrmed by CISS study and re-
lated theoretical work that there are multiple charge con-
duction pathways (MCCP) present in single-helical pro-

teins due to which they are able to polarize the electron
spin [14, 21, 22]. This possibility of MCCP make helical
protein molecules very good agents for long-range charge
transport. As proteins have these MCCP, electrons will
face less disturbances/environmental eﬀects during con-
duction and transport characteristics will be much rigid;
reproducing experimental results will be much simpler
with them.

In this paper we make an attempt to study the elec-
tronic transport properties of single helical proteins in-
corporating both the helical symmetry and possibility
of MCCP within tight-binding framework. We pro-
pose a model Hamiltonian to explore electronic transport
through single-helical proteins and compare our results
with another model proposed in Ref. [14]. We study dif-
ferent transport properties from localization behaviour
to I-V response including the eﬀects of environment that
are modeled in terms of disordered on-site potential of
the amino acids within the tight-binding Hamiltonian.
Our investigations show that due to presence of MCCP
the eﬀects of environment are much smaller which enable
long range coherent charge transfer in these biomolecules.
Interplay of helical symmetry and disorder also has non-
trivial eﬀects on localization and I-V responses of the
protein molecules.

II. THEORETICAL FORMULATION

The two-terminal electronic transport through single-
helical protein molecule can be simulated using the fol-
lowing tight-binding Hamiltonian for the entire system

Htot = Hpro + Hleads + Htun ,

(1)

where Hpro is the Hamiltonian for the protein molecule,
Hleads represents the one dimensional semi-inﬁnite leads
on the both sides of the protein molecule and Htun is the
tunneling Hamiltonian between protein molecule and the
leads. The Hamiltonian (Fig.1) for the protein molecule

is formed on the basis set spanned by the amino acids

i (ci) is the creation (annihilation) operator for
electrons at the ith Wannier state of the protein molecule
with length N, t = nearest neighbour hopping ampli-
tude, ǫ = on-site potential energy of the amino acids,
t
= hopping integral between two neighboring atomic
sites in adjacent pitches which incorporates the possi-
bility of MCCP along the helix. Here n is the number
of amino acids within a given pitch, parameter that ac-
counts for the helical symmetry. A dispersion relation
for an inﬁnite homogeneous chain of protein molecule
can be obtained following the above Hamiltonian: E =
ǫ + 2t cos(k) + 2t
cos(nk) which explicitly depends on
helical symmetry (n).

protein molecule. Black dots on the helix represent the amino
acids and dotted (black) lines between those black dots rep-
resent hopping (t

jacent pitches. The red line shows the single helix.

Apart from the above model, we also use another
model following Ref. [14] to compare our results. The
protein molecule is described in this model following
the tight-binding Hamiltonian (later on we refer this as
model:2 throughout the paper)

where c†

i , ci, ǫ and N have their usual meanings. tj=
t1e(lj −l1)/lc is the jth neighbouring hopping amplitude,
where lj is the distance between to neighbour i and i + j,

lc is the decay exponent and t1 is the nearest neigh-
bour hopping integral. Here we have assumed that wave
functions related to electrons decay exponentially over
distance. These assumptions are similar to the Slater-
Koster scheme, and lc can be obtained by matching to
ﬁrst-principle calculations [1, 14].

In order to study the transport behavior of protein
molecules, we use semi-inﬁnite 1D chains as leads con-
nected to the left (L) and right (R) ends of the protein
molecule and the corresponding Hamiltonian can be ex-
pressed as

Hleads = X

(4)

0c1 + c†

where i < 0 and i > N respectively represent left and
right semi-inﬁnite 1D leads . The tunneling Hamilto-
nian between the leads and protein molecule is given by
Htun = τ (cid:16)c†
N cN +1 + H.c.(cid:17) where τ is the tun-
neling matrix element between protein and the leads. In
order to obtain transmission probability T (E) of electron
through single-helical protein we use the Green’s func-
tion formalism [39]. The single particle retarded Green’s
function for the entire system at an energy E is given by
Gr = (E − H + iη)−1, where η → 0+. The transmis-
sion probability of an electron with incident energy E
is given by T (E) = Tr[ΓLGrΓRGa] where Tr represents
trace over reduced Hilbert space spanned by the pro-
tein molecule. The retarded and the advanced Green’s
functions in the reduced Hilbert space can be expressed
as Gr = [Ga]† = [E − Hpro − Σr
R + iη]−1, where
L

L(R) = H †
L(R)Htun is retarded (advanced) self en-

vanced) Green’s function for the left (right) lead. It can
easily be shown that ΓL(R) = −2 Im(Σr
L(R)), where Im
represents the Imaginary part. At absolute zero temper-
ature, using the Landauer formula, current through the
protein molecule for an applied bias voltage V is given
by I(V ) = 2e
EF −eV /2 T (E)dE , where EF is the Fermi
energy. We have assumed that voltage drop occurs only
at the boundaries of the conductor.

III. RESULTS:

′

To perform numerical study we use following param-
eter values for our proposed model throughout the en-
tire work: ǫ=0 eV, t=1.0 eV and t
=t/10=0.1 eV. We
compare our results with model:2 using the following pa-
rameters: l1=4.1, l2=5.8, l3=5.1, l4=6.2, l5=8.9, l6=10.0
and lc is taken as 0.9, all units are in ˚A. Using these val-
ues we can calculate the related hopping integrals (tj)
which gives t2 ∼ 0.16t1 and so on. It is clear that grad-
ually tj values will decrease (except t3 > t2) with in-

creasing distance, therefore we restrict ourselves to t6 and
set t1=t=1.0 eV. These parameter values for model:2 are
extracted from Ref. [14]. For ss-DNA, to calculate its
transport properties, we set t
=0 eV in our model which
cancels any possibility of MCCP. We ﬁrst study the local-
ization properties of the system. The localization length
(l) of the system is calculated from the Lyapunov expo-
nent (γ) [40]

γ = 1/l = − lim
N→∞

< ln(T (E)) > ,

(5)

where N = length of the system and <> denotes aver-
age over diﬀerent disorder conﬁgurations. In actual ex-
periments there are various environmental ﬂuctuations
that we have simulated in the model by considering the
on-site energy ǫ to be randomly distributed within the
range [ǫ-w/2, ǫ+w/2], where w represents the disorder
strength.

In ﬁg. 2 we show the variation of Lyapunov exponent
with disorder at diﬀerent energies for both the protein
molecule and ss-DNA. For n=3, at low disorder there
is almost no variation in the localization length for dif-
ferent energies. With increasing disorder the separation
between diﬀerent energies become distinguishable, ener-
gies close to the band centre become more localized than
the band edges. For n=5, variation between diﬀerent en-
ergies are maximum at low disorder which gradually van-
ishes with increasing disorder. For model:2, diﬀerent en-
ergies show diﬀerent localization length for almost entire
range of disorder with a crossover point around w=5. At
these disorder strength, localization length corresponding
to diﬀerent energies become nearly equal. For ss-DNA,
diﬀerent energies remain separated throughout the entire
range and the separation between them decreases slightly
at higher disorder. It is clear form these plots that n=5
has the maximum localization length for entire disorder
range, which shows it is the most favourable conforma-
tion of the protein molecule for charge transport.

Fig. 3 presents variation of γ with energy at diﬀerent
disorder strength for diﬀerent models and molecules. For
protein molecule with n=3, at low disorder system is less
localized and γ is close to zero. With increasing disorder,
γ increases and the system becomes more and more lo-
calized. However, at energies close to band centre (E=0
eV) localization is stronger than that at the band edges
which is also evident from previous plots (Fig. 2). For
n=5, there is a typical shape in γ within the energy re-
gion 1 to 1.5 eV (both -ve and +ve) which shows that
at these energies system is maximally localized even at
low disorder, with increasing disorder these features die
out gradually. These speciﬁc features are results of their
helical structure, the dispersion (E-k) of the molecule ex-
plicitly depends on the helical symmetry (n) (so the den-
sity of states also) and with changing n speciﬁc features
appear in diﬀerent transport parameters. For model:2,
there exists also the same feature at low disorder but
near the band centre which vanishes with increasing dis-

accessible states around the band centre, with increasing
disorder new states generates in these region at the cost
of the other states around band edges and this feature
vanishes. Another point to be noted that γ is smaller
in -ve energy region than +ve region, which indicates
that the band is not symmetric with respect to energy
and therefore eﬀect of disorder is diﬀerent on both side
of E=0 eV. For ss-DNA, γ increases with disorder, band
edges are more localized than the band centre which is
trivial in this case.

tein molecule using our proposed model for n=3 and 5.
It is clear from the plots that for low disorder, current
is almost linear and with increasing disorder (w=5) sys-
tem becomes insulating. One diﬀerence is to be noted
between n=3 and 5, current output is always greater
for n=5 than n=3. This diﬀerence becomes more dis-
tinguishable under environmental ﬂuctuations. If we in-
crease n, electrons get more number of pathways to hop
from one site to another. In other words, increasing n
provides a shortcut pathway for electrons to move along
the helix from one pitch to the next bypassing all other
amino acids in that pitch. Due to this galloping elec-

trons encounter less scattering, hence the current in-
creases. For n=5 at w=2, I-V response is linear at low
bias but it saturates with increasing bias voltage which
signiﬁes that there are no more accessible states avail-
able to conduct electrons at higher bias. For model:2, at
low disorder there is not so much variation in the cur-
rent response with our model, but for appreciable disor-
der (w=2) response become semiconducting with cut-oﬀ
voltage around 0.5 Volt, in contrast with linear response
achieved in our model. This variation of current is due

to the diﬀerence in these two models. The model:2 only
caters the possibility of multiple charge conduction path-
ways but neglect the helical symmetry which is a funda-
mental structure of these biomolecules. Our model also
incorporates this symmetry, due to which electron trans-
port enhances and current output is always greater in our
case (n=5). The I-V responses of the protein molecule
under environmental eﬀects match qualitatively well with
experimental ﬁndings [34, 41, 42]. For ss-DNA current
output is quite similar with the protein molecule for clean
case (w=0), but as soon as we apply disorder current
decreases rapidly.
If we compare ss-DNA with protein
molecule (n=5), one can easily see that even under small
disorder (w=0.5, 0.8) there is substantial drop in the cur-
rent output for ss-DNA. This shows that single-helical
proteins are much better conductor under external dis-
turbances than ss-DNA.

IV. CONCLUSION:

We present a detail analysis of electronic transport
properties of single-helical protein molecules based on
tight-binding framework. Though with recent progress
in CISS single helical proteins are getting considerable
attention these days but their basic electronic transport
properties remain quite under-explored. We show that
due to existence of both the helical symmetry and MCCP
transport properties are less aﬀected by external distur-

5

bances and these biomolecules can serve as a better alter-
native in nanoelectronics than its DNA counterparts (ss-
DNA) or other artiﬁcial semiconductor nanowires which
do not contain the possibility of MCCP. As a consequence
of these features long range coherent electron transport
can be possible in these biomolecules and eﬀect of envi-
ronment will also be lesser. We also show that by vary-
ing n i.e., by twist-stretching of the protein molecules
one can get diﬀerent responses (current outputs) under
environmental eﬀects. As an example, for n=5 system is
more conducting than n=3. We compare our results with
the model proposed by Guo et al. [14], that matches qual-
itatively well in almost every aspect. But as our model
includes both MCCP and helical symmetry (both are ac-
tually present in single-helical proteins) it provides more
number of conduction channels and system becomes less
localized. Due to helical symmetry (n) the behaviour
of localization properties also change which shows that
using twist-stretching or conformal changes one can use
a protein molecule in diﬀerent ways. We check our re-
sults for other model parameters also e.g., lc=0.4 and 1.4
˚A [14] but the qualitative behaviour remains the same. In
summary our study shows the rigidity of transport prop-
erties of the single-helical protein molecules even under
environmental eﬀects due to presence of both the heli-
cal symmetry and MCCP, which promises that they can
be used in future nanoelectronic devices with much more
reliability.
