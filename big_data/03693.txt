Abstract

We show that the lower and upper Frech´et-Hoeﬀding copulas, which are singular, can be
regularized to absolutely continuous copulas. The method, which is constructive and explicit,
states suﬃcient conditions for when an absolutely continuous copula can be achieved by
averaging. A higher degree of regularisation cannot be achieved with the proposed method.

1 Introduction

A copula is a mathematical tool designed to join marginal probability distribtions forming a joint
multidimensional probability distribution. The advantage with copulas is that they reduce the
problem of studying multidimensional probability distributions to studying a function, copula,
deﬁned on the unit hypercube. For a full introduction to copulas we refer to Nelsen [4]. As
pointed out in e.g.
[2],[6],[5] copulas have recently gained a lot in popularity. This is in part
driven by their usefulness in applied mathematics, especially mathematical ﬁnance. This paper
as well is motivated by a problem originating from applied mathematics but the application is
to be found in toxicology.
Let I = [0, 1] be the unit interval, and let I2 = I × I. A function C (u, v) with piecewise

continuous second derivatives is a cumulative distribution function on I2 if and only if

uv (u, v) ≥ 0, u, v ∈ (0, 1) ,
C(cid:48)(cid:48)
C (u, 0) = 0, u ∈ [0, 1] , and
C (0, v) = 0, v ∈ [0, 1]

(1)

(2)

(3)

The lower boundary values C (u, 0) , C (0, v) are zero; the upper boundary values C (u, 1) , C (1, v)
are the marginal distributions. The function C is said to be a copula if the marginals are uniform
which is summarised in the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1 A two-dimensional copula is a function C from I2 to I with the following proper-
ties:

1

1. For every u, v in I,

and

C(u, 0) = 0 = C(0, v)

2. For every u1, u2, v1, v2 in I such that u1 ≤ u2 and v1 ≤ v2,

C(u, 1) = u and C(1, v) = v;

C(u2, v2) − C(u2, v1) − C(u1, v2) + C(u1, v1) ≥ 0.

Let us consider an example.

(4)

(5)

(6)

Example 2 The function C(u, v) = uv is a copula since C(u, 1) = u, C(1, v) = v, C(u, 0) =
0 = C(0, v) and

C(u2, v2) − C(u2, v1) − C(u1, v2) + C(u1, v1) = (u2 − u1)(v2 − v1) ≥ 0.

It turns out that any copula C(u, v) is bounded from above by the Frech´et-Hoeﬀding upper
Indeed the Frech´et-Hoeﬀding
bound, and from below by the Frech´et-Hoeﬀding lower bound.
bounds are extremal copulas as they are copulas themselves, which is stated in the theorem
below.

Deﬁnition 3 The Frech´et-Hoeﬀding upper bound is given by M = min(u, v) and the Frech´et-
Hoeﬀding lower bound is given by W = max(u + v − 1).
Theorem 4 The upper and lower Frech´et-Hoeﬀding bounds M and W are copulas. Moreover,
for any copula C and all (u, v) ∈ I,

W (u, v) ≤ C(u, v) ≤ M (u, v).

(7)

While generalising a model, the probit model [1], for estimating the health impact on people
exposed to hazardous chemicals we realised that the problem can be cast as a copula problem.
The standard probit model is used to ﬁnd a statistical description of the injury outcome of a
population exposed to toxic substances. The model can be utilized to describe this outcome
at several discrete injury states, such as light injuries, severe injuries, and death. The joint
probability distribution of two succeeding injury states may be expressed as a multivariate normal
distribution with normal marginal distributions. By Sklar’s theorem, see e.g.
[4], there exists
a copula that prescribes how to joint, couple, the marginal distributions to achieve the probit
model. As it happens the corresponding copula is the upper Frech´et-Hoeﬀding copula M . Our
generalisation of the probit model aims at treating the population as an aggregate of individuals
rather than as one entity.
In this approach individuals are allocated one threshold value per
injury state which determines at which exposure they will reach every state. The thresholds
are distributed among the population according to the standard normal distribution. However,
individuals must be able to possess diﬀerent sensibility for the diﬀerent injury states which means
that they will not be located on the diagonal axis on the multivariate probability distribution
which otherwise would be the trivial solution. As the thresholds are distributed, the overall
statistics of the population must be kept intact. In copula terms this equates to rearranging the
mass of the joint probability distribution without changing the marginal distributions.. Adding
the criteria that the probit model should readily support numerical investigation we arrived at
the condition that the generalised probit model is feasible if the upper Frech´et-Hoeﬀding copula
M can be regularized and still remain a copula. In this paper we will focus on this mathematical
problem while the full toxicological motivation and the generalised probit model will be published
elsewhere in the toxicology literature.
The regularity that we are aiming for is absolute continuity, which is deﬁned in the following
way:

2

Deﬁnition 5 A two-dimensional copula C is said to be absolutely continuous if C(u, v) has a
density c(u, v) and

C(u, v) ≡

c(s, t)dtds for all (u, v) ∈ I2.

(8)

(cid:90) u

(cid:90) v

0

0

We note that ∂2C/∂u∂v exists almost everywhere in I2, see Theorem 2.2.7 in [4], and is equal
to the density c(u, v). The example copula C(u, v) = uv that we considered earlier is absolutely
continuous.

Example 6 (cont.) The copula C(u, v) = uv is absolutely continuous since

(cid:90) u

(cid:90) v

1dsdt = uv for all (u, v) ∈ I2.

0

0

The Frech´et-Hoeﬀding copulas on the other hand are not absolutely continuous, indeed they
are not absolutely continuous on any subdomain ⊂ I2, and are thus singular. Geometrically the
Frech´et-Hoeﬀding upper and lower copula are C 0 surfaces each made up of two planar surfaces
intersecting transversally along a line segment, see ﬁgure 1. Regularising these functions, W and
M , is, of course, trivial: any type of averaging around and along the transversal intersection
will smooth out the C 1-discontinuity. The point here is that the regularized function should still
be a copula. For our purposes, the probit model, it would suﬃce to work with only the upper
Frech´et-Hoeﬀding M copula, but the regularization method works equally well for the lower
one W . Thus the main contribution in this paper is that we prove under which conditions the
upper and lower Frech´et-Hoeﬀding copula can be regularised to absolutely continuous copulas,
see Theorem 7. We then show that this class of copulas is non-empty by providing an explicit
example. We remark that the proposed averaging method can not be used to prove regularity
beyond, at most, C 2 due to unbounded third derivatives.

The question of regularity of copulas and the associated diﬀerentiability of copulas has
been studied before and there are at least two well-known classes of diﬀerentiable copulas:
Archimedean and Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copulas. Recently a preprint claiming to char-
acterize all twice diﬀerentiable copulas was presented [3]. In that paper also a new class, Fourier
copulas, of twice diﬀerentiable copulas is introduced.

2 Setting of the problem

As was hinted at in the introduction, regularization of the upper and lower Frech´et-Hoeﬀding
copulas M and W will be achieved by averaging these copulas at, and in the vicinity of, their
respective singularities: for M the singularity is located along the diagonal while for W it is the
anti-diagonal (see ﬁgure 1). As averaging method we choose a family of discs and in each such
disc we replace the value of the copula with the average value of the copula in that disc. Due
to the simple geometry it turns out that these averages can be expressed explicitly, however the
expressions become somewhat involved due to evaluating integrals on circle segments.

It is convenient to make the following change of coordinates

(10)
and study the problem in (w, z)-coordinates. Let C(u, v) be a copula deﬁned on I2. With a
slight abuse of notation, we write C (w, z) = C (u, v). C(w, z) is deﬁned on

The copula conditions, stated in Deﬁnition 1, can be summarized in the following way

uv (u, v) ≥ 0, (u, v) ∈ int(I2)
C(cid:48)(cid:48)

C = max (0, u + v − 1) = min (u, v) , (u, v) ∈ ∂I2,

and may be checked in (w, z)-coordinates instead. The inverse coordinate transformation is given
by

(cid:48)
r(cid:48)(cid:48) = tanh

by the deﬁnitions above. Hence |r(cid:48) (w)| < 1. Furthermore,

hence it suﬃces to show that x(cid:48) (w) + y(cid:48) (w) ≥ 0 for r(cid:48)(cid:48)

since |r(cid:48) (w)| < 1 and ϕ > 0. Hence r (w) satisﬁes the assumptions in the theorem, so ¯M (u, v)
is an absolutely continuous copula with probability mass supported on |z| ≤ r (w).
It may be interesting to note that upon transforming the copula random variables (U, V ) back
to the original X = Φ−1 (U ), Y = Φ−1 (V ) we obtain a pair of Gaussian random variables
(X, Y ) with standard normal marginal distributions pX (x) = ϕ (x), pY (y) = ϕ (y) and joint pdf
pX,Y (x, y) supported on |y − x| ≤ d.

As the example shows, verifying the conditions in Theorem 7 may require some work. In the
example the radius function r(w, z) did not have a general dependence on both variables, indeed
r(w, z) = r(w) in the example, and this simpliﬁed the veriﬁcation of the conditions. In general the
conditions are easier to verify if the radius function has a product-structure r(w, z) = p(w)q(z)
which we state in the following corollary of Theorem 7.

Corollary 9 If r (w, z) = p (w) q (z) and p, q > 0 then the conclusions for ¯M are true if

The proof of Theorem 7 relies on being able to construct radius functions r = r (w, z) such that
the circular disc averages of the functions |w| and |z|,

where Dr(w, z) is the circular disc with radius r centred at (w, z). Once we have established
what conditions the radius functions r = r(w, z) have to satisfy (the averaging Lemma 11 below)
we pick those radius functions and apply the disc averaging method to the upper and the lower
Frech´et-Hoeﬀding copulas M and W and show that it results in absolutely continuous copulas:
regularised Frech´et-Hoeﬀding bounds M and W .
Evaluating the disc averages of the functions |w| and |z| and exploring the diﬀerentiability
properties of these averages with respect to the choice of radius function r(w, z) and the part of
the domain that is considered is summarised in the following technical averaging Lemma.

which proves the equality in (52). Proving the disc average F (w, z), (51), is analogous.
In a preamble to studying how the derivatives of F (w, z) and G(w, z) behaves, we note that

g(cid:48) (ρ) =

and g (ρ) → 1, g(cid:48) (ρ) → ±1 and g(cid:48)(cid:48) (ρ) → 0 as ρ → ±1, hence g ∈ C 2 (R) and convex. However,

Now we are ready to study the properties of the second derivatives of G, with the aim of proving
points 2. and 4. in the Lemma. Let us remind ourselves that G is deﬁned as, compare equation
(52),

G(w, z) = r(w, z)g(ρ(w, z)).

Taking derivatives, ﬁrst once and then twice, with respect to w and z respectively gives

Dividing by g(cid:48)(cid:48) we denote the resulting quadratic polynomial in ρ by p(ρ)
r (G(cid:48)(cid:48)

ww) /3 ≡ p (ρ) .
(70)
A quadratic polynomial p (ρ) = aρ2 + bρ + c is ≥ 0 for −1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1 if and only if 1) The values at
the endpoints are nonnegative, i.e., p (−1) ≥ 0 and p (1) ≥ 0, which is equivalent to |b| ≤ a + c,
and 2) if there is local minimum between the endpoints, i.e., if |b| ≤ 2|a|, then this minimum is
nonnegative, i.e, c ≥ b2/ (4a). If |b| ≤ 2|a| then b2/ (4a) ≤ 1 so a simpler, suﬃcient condition
would be |b| ≤ a + c and c ≥ 1. Applying this condition to (70) we see that

The last condition is only needed when

The radius function r is always positive, and by (59) we have g(cid:48)(cid:48) > 0 for |ρ| < 1, hence equation
(71) implies that G(cid:48)(cid:48)
ww > 0 if conditions (72) and (73) are satisﬁed. Remember that
ρ = z/r(w, z), hence |ρ| < 1 is equivalent to |z| < r(w, z). Thus we have proved statement 4. in
the lemma.
We remark that the conditions stated in the lemma (and Theorem 7) are not sharp since we

Next, let us consider the remaining unproved statement, statement 3. It follows analogously by
the arguments above by interchanging the roles of w and z. That is, let us consider

F (w, z) =

πr2

|w(cid:48)| dw(cid:48)dz(cid:48).

(cid:90)(cid:90)

Interchanging the roles of w and z, and applying the the same arguments as above to

(cid:18) w

(cid:19)

F (w, z) = r (w, z) g

we obtain

Thus we have proved the lemma.

We are now in a position to prove Theorem 7.
Proof. Let r(w, z) be a twice continously diﬀerentiable and strictly positive function such that
z)2 ≤ (1/2 − |r(cid:48)
(r(cid:48)
ww. Considering the deﬁnition of ¯W (u, v) in (26) and
inserting the expression for the lower Frech´et-Hoeﬀding copula W stated in (22) gives

Since r, g ∈ C 2 it follows that ¯W and ¯M are C 2; however they are not C 3 since g(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) (ρ) is
unbounded as ρ (cid:37) 1 or ρ (cid:38) −1. The suﬃcient conditions on r (w, z) in in the lemma are
ww ≥ 0, and hence it
fullﬁlled in the respective cases. Therefore F (cid:48)(cid:48)
zz ≥ 0.
follows, see the copula deﬁnition (18), that ¯W (cid:48)(cid:48)
uv = ¯M(cid:48)(cid:48)
Furthermore, the averaging method employed does not alter the boundary values of the copula,
hence also the copula condition (19) is satisﬁed since W and M are copulas. Thus we have
proved that ¯W and ¯M are absolutely continuous copulas.

zz ≥ 0 and G(cid:48)(cid:48)
