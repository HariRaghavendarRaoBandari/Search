Abstract. We reformulate the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the BGG category O
of Lie algebras of type D via the theory of canonical bases arising from quantum
symmetric pairs initiated by Weiqiang Wang and the author. This is further applied
to formulate and establish for the ﬁrst time the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the BGG
category O of the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n).

Introduction

0.1. The Kazhdan-Lusztig theory provides the solution to the problem of determining
the irreducible characters in the BGG category O of semisimple Lie algebras ([KL,
BB, BK]). The theory was originally formulated in terms of the canonical bases (i.e.,
Kazhdan-Lusztig bases) of Hecke algebras. On the other hand, the classiﬁcation of
ﬁnite-dimensional simple Lie superalgebras over complex numbers has been obtained
by Kac ([Kac]) in 1970’s, while the representation theory of Lie superalgebras turns out
to be very diﬃcult. One of the main reasons is that the corresponding Weyl group of
a Lie superalgebra is not enough to control the linkage principle in the BGG category
O. Thus the relevant Hecke algebras do not play signiﬁcant roles in the representation
theory of Lie superalgebras as in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras.
The Lie superalgebras gl(m|n) and osp(m|2n), which generalize the classical Lie al-
gebras, are arguably the most important classes of Lie superalgebras. In 2003, Brundan
in [Br1] formulated a Kazhdan-Lusztig type conjecture for the full category O of general
linear Lie superalgebras. The Jimbo-Schur ([Jim]) duality plays a crucial role in Brun-
dan’s conjecture, which allows a reformulation of the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory in type
A in terms of the canonical bases of the quantum group Uq(slk) of type A. Brundan’s

conjecture was proved ﬁrst by Cheng, Lam and Wang [CLW15] and later by Brundan,
Losev and Webster [BLW].

Recently in [BW13], Weiqiang Wang and the author initiated a theory of canonical
bases arising from quantum symmetric pairs. We showed that a coideal subalgebra of
Uq(slk) centralizes the Hecke algebra of type B (of equal parameters) when acting on
V⊗m, the tensor product of the natural representation V of Uq(slk). We constructed a
(new) ı-canonical basis on V⊗m, which allows a reformulation of the Kazhdan-Lusztig
theory of type B independent of the Hecke algebra. The theory was further applied
to formulate and establish for the ﬁrst time the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the BGG
category O of the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra osp(2m + 1|2n). The geometric
realization of the coideal subalgebras considered there and the canonical bases on the
modiﬁed coideal subalgebras have been given in [BKLW] and [LW] using partial ﬂag
varieties of type B/C.

On the other hand, the problem of determining the irreducible characters in the
BGG category O of the ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n) is still open
since 1970’s.

0.2.
In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the irreducible character prob-
lem in the BGG category O of modules of integral and half-integral weights of the
ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n). We adapt the theory of canonical bases
from [BW13] to quantum symmetric pairs with diﬀerent parameters. The non-super
specialization the work here amounts a reformulation of the classical Kazhdan-Lusztig
theory of type C/D. This paper is a sequel of [BW13].

0.3. A naive idea to follow [BW13] is to ﬁnd the subalgebra of Uq(slk), whose action
on the tensor product V⊗m centralizing the action of the Hecke algebra HDm of type D
on V⊗m. Such (new) subalgebra has been constructed using the geometry of isotropic
partial ﬂag varieties of type D in [FL]. However the subalgebra is very involved, as
expected, due to the complicated structure of isotropic ﬂag varieties of type D, which
makes it not suitable for further application to the category O of Lie superalgebras.

We realize a natural and simple way to overcome the diﬃculty is to ﬁrst consider
the Hecke algebra H1

Hecke algebra of type Bm with two parameters p and q over Q(q, p), generated by
H p

0.4. Ehrig and Stroppel used the same coideal subalgebra Uı
q(slk) of the quantum
group Uq(slk) to study the parabolic category O of the Lie algebra so(2m) in [ES]
independently and simultaneously from [BW13]. They established the commutativity
q(slk) and HDm on the tensor space V⊗m. The actions of the
between the actions of Uı
q(slk) on V⊗m have been identiﬁed with the actions of
Chevalley type generators of Uı
translation functors on the category O of the Lie algebra so(2m). However, neither the
establishment of the ı-canonical basis nor the (re)formulation of the (super) Kazhdan-
Lusztig theory of type D was available there.

with equal parameters p = q.
It was showed there that certain coideal subalgebra of the quantum group Uq(slk) of
type A forms double centralizers with Hq
when acting on the tensor space V⊗m.
In this paper, we consider the Hecke algebra H1
with p = 1. Thus the (diﬀerent)
centralizing coideal subalgebra Uı
q(slk) of Uq(slk) consider in this paper is of diﬀerent
parameters than the one considered in [BW13], where the choice of the parameters

The construction of ı-canonical bases developed in [BW13] applies to the coideal sub-
algebras with diﬀerent parameters without diﬃculty, that is, simple Uq(slk)-modules
and their tensor products admit ı-canonical bases. In the ongoing work [BW16], we
generalize the construction of ı-canonical bases to more general quantum symmetric
pairs (see also Remark 2.17).

Thanks to the (weak) Schur type dualities for the type D (and type C), the classical
Kazhdan-Lusztig theory of type D (and type C, respectively) can be reformulated in
terms of ı-canonical bases on V⊗m (on (V∗)⊗n, respectively). More precisely speaking,
the entries of the transition matrix between the ı-canonical basis and the standard basis
(i.e., the monomial basis) are exactly the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of type D (and
type C, respectively.)

limit of the quantum symmetric pair (Uq(sl∞), Uı
q(sl∞)). The theory of the super
duality developed in [CLW11] plays the essential role.

For a 0m1n-sequence b (which consists of m zeros and n ones), we deﬁne a tensor
space Tb using m copies of V and n copies of V∗ with the tensor order prescribed by
b (with 0 corresponds to V). In this approach, Tb (more precisely, its integral form)
at q = 1 is identiﬁed with the Grothendieck group [Ob] of the BGG category Ob of

4

HUANCHEN BAO

osp(2m|2n)-modules (relative to a Borel subalgebra of type b). We construct the ı-
canonical basis and dual ı-canonical basis on (a suitable completion of) the tensor space
Tb. The construction of these bases is exactly the same as in [BW13], while only the
precise formulas of these bases are diﬀerent (which is irrelevant to the construction).

For the Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n), there are generally two types of fundamental
systems, hence related Dynkin diagrams, with respect to diﬀerent choices of the Borel
subalgebras b: with a type D branch (where b starts with 02) in the Dynkin diagram;
or with a type C branch (where b starts with 1) in the Dynkin diagram. Those two
types of fundamental systems are not conjugate under the Weyl group actions, but
diﬀer by odd reﬂections. We prove the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the category Ob of
the Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n) with respect to b of the ﬁrst type by induction on n,
where the base case n = 0 follows from the classical Kazhdan-Lusztig theory of type D.
On the other hand, the proof of the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the category Ob of the
Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n) with respect to b of the second type follows by induction
on m, where the base case m = 0 follows from the classical Kazhdan-Lusztig theory
of type C. The induction processes of the two types are actually similar, where we
compare category O’s with respect to adjacent Borel subalgebras (switching adjacent
0 and 1 in the sequence b), as well as compare the parabolic category O with the full
category O. We also study certain inﬁnite rank limits of the parabolic category O.

1. Preliminaries on quantum groups

In this preliminary section, we review some basic deﬁnitions and constructions on
quantum groups from Lusztig’s book [Lu2]. We also introduce the involution θ and its
quotient Λθ which will be used in quantum symmetric pairs.

1.1. The involution θ and the lattice Λθ. Let q be an indeterminate. For r ∈ N,
we deﬁne the following index sets:

I2r+1 = {i ∈ Z | −r ≤ i ≤ r},

the integral weight lattice, and denote by (·, ·) the standard bilinear pairing on Λ such

that (εa, εb) = δab for all a, b. For any µ =Pi ciαi ∈ NΠ, set ht(µ) =Pi ci.

Let θ be the involution of the weight lattice Λ such that

θ(εi− 1

2

) = −ε−i+ 1

2

,

for all i ∈ I.

We shall also write λθ = θ(λ), for λ ∈ Λ. The involution θ preserves the bilinear form
(·, ·) on the weight lattice Λ and induces an automorphism on the simple system Π such
that αθ

i = α−i for all i ∈ I.

Let Λθ = {µ ∈ Λ | µθ + µ} and Λθ = Λ/Λθ. For µ ∈ Λ, denote by µ the image of µ
under the quotient map. There is a well-deﬁned bilinear pairing Z[αi−α−i]i∈I×Λθ → Z,

such that (Pi>0 ai(αi − α−i), µ) := Pi>0 ai(αi − α−i, µ) for any µ ∈ Λθ with any

preimage µ ∈ Λ.

1.2. The quantum group. The quantum group U = Uq(slk+1) is deﬁned to be the
associative Q(q)-algebra generated by Eαi, Fαi, Kαi, K −1
αi , i ∈ I, subject to the following
relations (for i, j ∈ I):

αi = K −1

if |i − j| > 1,

if |i − j| = 1,

if |i − j| > 1.

Let U+, U0 and U− be the Q(q)-subalgebra of U generated by Eαi, K ±1

αi , and Fαi
respectively, for i ∈ I. We introduce the divided power F (a)
αi/[a]!, where a ≥ 0,
[a] = (qa − q−a)/(q − q−1) and [a]! = [1][2] · · · [a]. Let A = Z[q, q−1]. Let AU+ be the
A-subalgebra of U+ generated by E(a)
for various a ≥ 0 and i ∈ I. Similarly let AU−
αi
be the A-subalgebra of U− generated by E(a)
αi

for various a ≥ 0 and i ∈ I.

αi = F a

Proposition 1.1.

(1) There is an involution ω on the Q(q)-algebra U such that

ω(Eαi) = Fαi, ω(Fαi ) = Eαi, and ω(Kαi ) = K −1
αi

for all i ∈ I.

(2) There is an anti-linear (q 7→ q−1) bar involution of the Q-algebra U such that

Eαi = Eαi, F αi = Fαi, and K αi = K −1
αi

for all i ∈ I.

(Sometimes we denote the bar involution on U by ψ.)

6

HUANCHEN BAO

Recall that U is a Hopf algebra with a coproduct

(1.2)

∆ :U −→ U ⊗ U,

∆(Eαi) = 1 ⊗ Eαi + Eαi ⊗ K −1
αi ,
∆(Fαi ) = Fαi ⊗ 1 + Kαi ⊗ Fαi ,
∆(Kαi ) = Kαi ⊗ Kαi.

There is a unique Q(q)-algebra homomorphism ǫ : U → Q(q), called counit, such that
ǫ(Eαi) = 0, ǫ(Fαi ) = 0, and ǫ(Kαi) = 1.

1.3. Braid group actions and canonical bases. Let W := WAk = Sk+1 be the
Weyl group of type Ak. Recall [Lu2] for each αi and each ﬁnite-dimensional U-module
M , a linear operator Tαi on M is deﬁned by, for λ ∈ Λ and m ∈ Mλ,
αi E(c)

(−1)bqb−acE(a)

Tαi(m) =

αi F (b)

αi m.

X

a,b,c≥0;−a+b−c=(λ,αi)

These Tαi’s induce automorphisms of U, denoted by Tαi as well, such that

Tαi(um) = Tαi(u)Tαi (m),

for all u ∈ U, m ∈ M.

As automorphisms on U and as Q(q)-linear isomorphisms on M , the Tαi’s satisfy the
braid group relations ([Lu2, Theorem 39.4.3]):

TαiTαj = Tαj Tαi,

TαiTαj Tαi = Tαj TαiTαj ,

if |i − j| > 1,

if |i − j| = 1,

Hence for each w ∈ W , Tw can be deﬁned independent of the choices of reduced
expressions of w. (The Tαi here is T ′′

i,+ in [Lu2]).

Denote by ℓ(·) the length function of W , and let w0 be the longest element of W .

The following lemma is well-known (cf. [BW13, Lemma 1.5]).

Lemma 1.2. The following identities hold:
Tw0(Kαi) = K −1
α−i,
Let Λ+ = {λ ∈ Λ | 2(αi, λ)/(αi, αi) ∈ N, ∀i ∈ I} be the set of dominant weights.
Note that µ ∈ Λ+ if and only if µθ ∈ Λ+, since the bilinear pairing (·, ·) on Λ is invariant
under θ : Λ → Λ.

Tw0(Eαi) = −Fα−iKα−i,

Tw0(Fα−i ) = −K −1

for i ∈ I.

αi Eαi,

Let M (λ) be the Verma module of U with highest weight λ ∈ Λ and with a highest
weight vector denoted by η or ηλ. We deﬁne a U-module ωM (λ), which has the same
underlying vector space as M (λ) but with the action twisted by the involution ω given
in Proposition 1.1. When considering η as a vector in ωM (λ), we shall denote it by
ξ or ξ−λ. The Verma module M (λ) associated to dominant λ ∈ Λ+ has a unique
ﬁnite-dimensional simple quotient U-module, denoted by L(λ). Similarly we deﬁne the
AL(λ) = AU+ξ be the
U-module ωL(λ). For λ ∈ Λ+, we let AL(λ) = AU−η and ω
A-submodules of L(λ) and ωL(λ), respectively.

We call a U-module M equipped with an anti-linear involution ψ is called involutive
if ψ(um) = ψ(u)ψ(m), ∀u ∈ U, m ∈ M . The U-modules ωL(λ) and L(λ) are both
involutive. Given any two involutive U-modules M and M ′, Lusztig showed that their
tensor product M ⊗ M ′ is also involutive ([Lu2, §27.31]).

In [Lu1, Lu2] and [Ka], the canonical basis B of AU+ ∼= AU− has been constructed.
For any element b ∈ B, when considered as an element in U− or U+, we shall denote
it by b− or b+, respectively. In [Lu2], subsets B(λ) of B is also constructed for each
λ ∈ Λ+, such that {b−ηλ | b ∈ B(λ)} gives the canonical basis of AL(λ). Similarly
{b+ξ−λ | b ∈ B(λ)} gives the canonical basis of ω

AL(λ).

2. Quantum Symmetric pairs

In this section we shall develop the theory of ı-canonical bases for the quantum

symmetric pairs :

(Uq(sl2r+1), Uı

q(sl2r+1))

and

(Uq(sl2r+2), Uı

q(sl2r+2)).

The deﬁnitions of the quantum symmetric pairs shall be given in the ﬁrst two sections,
separately (see also [ES]). The theory of ı-canonical bases are nevertheless uniform in
both cases. Therefore after stating their deﬁnitions we shall formulate their general
theory together. Section 2.1 - Section 2.3 are analogous to [BW13, Part 1] hence we
shall omit the proofs almost entirely. Some of the quantum symmetric paris considered
here are of diﬀerent parameters than the ones considered in [BW13] (See also [BW16] for
more general construction). We refer to [Ko] for general theory of quantum symmetric
pairs.

q(sl2r+1)),

(Uq(sl2r+2), Uı
q(sl2r+2)) and its applications. The formulation of the theory is uni-
form for both cases. Hence we shall drop the subscript, and denote both quantum
symmetric pairs simply by (U, Uı), and denote the correspond index sets simply by
I = Ik and Iı = Iı
k, for k = 2r + 2 or 2r + 1. In this section we shall assume all modules
are ﬁnite dimensional.

(Uq(sl2r+1), Uı

Let bU be the completion of the Q(q)-vector space U with respect to the following
descending sequence of subspaces U+U0(cid:0)Pht(µ)≥N U−
−µ(cid:1), for N ≥ 1. Then we have
the obvious embedding of U into bU. We let bU− be the closure of U− in bU, and so
bU− ⊆ bU. By continuity the Q(q)-algebra structure on U extends to a Q(q)-algebra
structure on bU. The bar involution ¯ on U extends by continuity to an anti-linear
involution on bU, also denoted by ¯. The following proposition is the counterpart of
that Υ0 = 1, and Υ =Pµ Υµ ∈ bU− intertwines the bar involution ψı on Uı and the
(in bU):

[BW13, §2.3, §2.4 and §4.4].
Proposition 2.11. There is a unique family of elements Υµ ∈ AU−

bar involution ψ on U via the embedding ı; that is, Υ satisﬁes the following identity

−µ for µ ∈ NΠ such

(2.8)
Moreover, Υµ = 0 unless µθ = µ. We also have Υ · Υ = 1.

ı(ψıu)Υ = Υ ψ(ı(u)),

for all u ∈ Uı.

Consider a Q(q)-valued function ζ on Λ such that

(only for the pair (Uq(sl2r+1), Uı

q(sl2r+1)),

ζ(µ + α0) = −qζ(µ)
ζ(µ + αi) = −q(αi,µ+αi)−(α−i,µ)ζ(µ),
ζ(µ + α−i) = −q(α−i,µ+α−i)−(αi,µ)−1ζ(µ),

∀µ ∈ Λ, i ∈ Iı.

Such ζ clearly exists (but not unique). For any weight U-module M , deﬁne a Q(q)-
linear map on M as follows:

eζ : M −→ M,
eζ(m) = ζ(µ)m,

∀m ∈ Mµ.

Recall that w0 is the longest element of W and Tw0 is the associated braid group
element from Section 1.3. The following proposition is the analog of [BW13, Theo-
rem 2.18].

Proposition 2.12. For any ﬁnite-dimensional U-module M , the composition map

is a Uı-module isomorphism.

u ∈ Uı.

12

HUANCHEN BAO

We call a Uı-module M equipped with an anti-linear involution ψı involutive (or
ı-involutive) if ψı(um) = ψı(u)ψı(m), ∀u ∈ Uı, m ∈ M . For any involutive U-module
M with anti-linear involution ψ, the anti-linear involution

ψı := Υ ◦ ψ : M −→ M

makes M an ı-involution Uı-module (cf.
In particular,
since we know both L(λ) and ωL(λ) are involutive U-modules, they are ı-involutive Uı-
modules as well. The following theorem is the counterpart of [BW13, Proposition 4.20].

[BW13, Proposition 3.10]).

Theorem 2.13. Let λ ∈ Λ+. The Uı-module ωL(λ) admits a unique basis

which is ψı-invariant and of the form

Bı(λ) := {T λ

b | b ∈ B(λ)}

T λ

b = b+ξ−λ +Xb′≺b

b;b′b′+ξ−λ,
tλ

for tλ

b;b′ ∈ qZ[q].

Deﬁnition 2.14. Bı(λ) is called the ı-canonical basis of the Uı-module ωL(λ).

Recall in [Lu2, Chapter 27] Lusztig has developed a theory of based U-modules
(M, B) (for a general quantum group U of ﬁnite type). The basis B generates a Z[q]-
submodule M and an A-submodule AM of M .

Theorem 2.15. Let (M, B) be a ﬁnite-dimensional based U-module.

(1) The Uı-module M admits a unique basis (called ı-canonical basis) Bı := {Tb |

b ∈ B} which is ψı-invariant and of the form

(2.11)

Tb = b + Xb′∈B,b′≺b

tb;b′b′,

for tb;b′ ∈ qZ[q].

(2) Bı forms an A-basis for the A-lattice AM , and Bı forms a Z[q]-basis for the

Z[q]-lattice M.

Recall that a tensor product of ﬁnite-dimensional simple U-modules is a based U-

module by [Lu2, Theorem 27.3.2].

Corollary 2.16. Let λ1, . . . , λr ∈ Λ+. The tensor product of ﬁnite-dimensional simple
U-modules ωL(λ1) ⊗ . . . ⊗ ωL(λr) admits a unique ψı-invariant basis of the form (2.11)
(called ı-canonical basis).

Remark 2.17. The construction of the ı-canonical bases in this paper follows straightfor-
wardly from [BW13]. In the ongoing work [BW16], we construct the ı-canonical bases
for general quantum symmetric pairs. In their preprint [BK15], Balagovic and Kolb
constructed the intertwiners for general quantum symmetric pairs (with some overlap
with our [BW16]), which leads to the universal solutions of the (quantum) reﬂection
equation (a generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation).

3. Dualities

In this section, we study various dualities between the coideal algebras and the Hecke
algebras of type B/C/D. The theory is again uniform in the most cases, except in
subsection 3.4, where we only study the duality between Uı
q(sl2r+1) and HCn. Hence
we shall simplify the notation (except in subsection 3.4), and denote both quantum
symmetric pairs simply by (U, Uı), and denote the correspond index sets simply by
I = Ik and Iı = Iı

k, for k = 2r + 2 or 2r + 1.

3.1. The (Uı, H1

)-duality. We set I = Ik = {a± 1

space V :=Pa∈I Q(q)va be the natural representation of U, hence a Uı-module. The

action of U on V is given by (i ∈ I and a ∈ I)

2 ,a = va+1

and Kαiva = q

We shall call V the natural representation of Uı as well. For m ∈ Z>0, V⊗m becomes
a natural U-module (hence a Uı-module) via the iteration of the coproduct ∆. Note
that V is an involutive U-module with ψ deﬁned as

ψ(va) := va,

for all a ∈ I.

Therefore V⊗m is an involutive U-module and hence a ı-involutive Uı-module.

Let WBm be the Coxeter groups of type Bm with simple reﬂections sj, 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1,
∼= Sm.
where the subgroup generated by si, 1 ≤ i ≤ m − 1 is isomorphic to WAm−1
The group WBm and its subgroup Sm act naturally on I m on the right as follows: for
any f ∈ I m, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we have

(3.1)

f · sj =((. . . , f (j + 1), f (j), . . . ),

(−f (1), f (2), . . . , f (m)),

if j > 0;
if j = 0.

Let Hp

It is generated by H p

be the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Bm with two parameters p and q over
0 , H1, H2, . . . , Hm−1, subject to the following relations

Let H1

Bm

be the degenerate Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Bm over Q(q) with the
0 as s0 in this case. Note that we

parameter p = 1. We shall write the generator H p
have s2

0 = 1 and s0 = s0.

For any f ∈ I m, we can view f as a function from the set {1, 2, . . . , m} to I m. Thus
we deﬁne Mf = vf (1) ⊗ · · · ⊗ vf (m). The Weyl group WBm acts on I m by (3.1) as before.

14

HUANCHEN BAO

Now the degenerate Hecke algebra H1

acts on the Q(q)-vector space V⊗m as follows

Mf ·si + (q−1 − q)Mf ,

if f (i) = f (i + 1);
if f (i) < f (i + 1);
if f (i) > f (i + 1);

Introduce the Q(q)-subspaces of V:

V− =Mi∈I
V+ =Mi∈I

Q(q)(v−i − vi),

Q(q)(v−i + vi).

The following lemma follows from direct computation.

Lemma 3.1. V− and V+ are Uı-submodules of V. Moreover, we have V = V− ⊕ V+.

Let s be the largest number in I. Now we ﬁx ζ in (2.10) such that ζ(ε−s) = 1. It

follows that

ζ(εs−i) = (−q)−2s+i,

for s − i ∈ I.

Let us compute the Uı-homomorphism T = Υ ◦eζ ◦ Tw0 (see Proposition 2.12) on the

U-module V; we remind that w0 here is associated to U instead of WBm or WAm−1.

Lemma 3.2. The Uı-isomorphism T−1 on V acts as a scalar −id on the submodule
V− and as id on the submodule V+.

Proof. First one computes that the action of Tw0 on V is given by

Tw0(v−s+i) = (−q)2s−ivs−i,

for 0 ≤ i ≤ 2s.

Hence

(3.3)

One computes the ﬁrst few terms of Υ. For example we have Υα

(3.6)

T−1(v−i − vi) = (−1)(v−i − vi),
T−1(v−i + vi) = (v−i + vi).

(for the pair (Uq(sl2r+2), Uı

q(sl2r+2))),

The lemma now follows from Lemma 3.2, since T−1 is a Uı-isomorphism.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. We remind the readers that the intertwiner Υ associated with the quantum
symmetric pair (U, Uı) in this paper are diﬀerent from the one in [BW13], since we are
considering quantum symmetric pairs with diﬀerent parameters. This leads to diﬀerent
actions of T on the natural representation V of U (c.f. [BW13, Lemma 5.3]).

KAZHDAN-LUSZTIG THEORY OF SUPER TYPE D AND QUANTUM SYMMETRIC PAIRS

15

We have the following generalization of Schur-Jimbo duality, whose proof follows

from [BW13, Theorem 5.4].

Theorem 3.4 ((Uı, H1

)-duality).

(1) The action of T−1 ⊗ idm−1 coincides with

the action of s0 ∈ H1

Bm on V⊗m.

Bm

(2) The actions of Uı and H1

on V⊗m commute with each other, and they form

Bm

double centralizers.

Remark 3.5. By variations of the choices of the subalgebras (Proposition 2.3 and Propo-
sition 2.8), we can obtain the coideal subalgebras Uı that forms double centralizers with
the Hecke algebra Hp

of two parameters, when acting on the tensor product V⊗m.

Bm

3.2. The Hecke algebra HDm of type D. Let WDm be the Coxeter group of type
Dm(m ≥ 2) with simple reﬂections sd
0 and sj, 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1. The Coxeter group WDm
can be realized as a subgroup of WBm via the following embedding : sd
0 7→ s0s1s0 and
si 7→ si for i ≥ 1. When m = 1, we understand WDm as the trivial group. The Weyl
group WDm acts on the set I m via the embedding.

Let HDm be the Iwahori-Hecke algebra of type Dm over Q(q). It is generated by H0,

H1, . . . , Hm−1, subject to the following relations:

(Hi − q−1)(Hi + q) = 0,

HiHi+1Hi = Hi+1HiHi+1,

HiHj = HjHi,

H0H2H0 = H2H0H2

and H0Hi = HiH0,

for i ≥ 0,
for i > 0,

for |i − j| > 1,
for i 6= 2.

The bar involution on HDm is the unique anti-linear involution deﬁned by Hi = H −1
and q = q−1, for all 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1.

i

Lemma 3.6. There is a Q(q)-algebra embedding ρ : HDm → H1

Bm

such that

ρ(H0) = s0H1s0

and

ρ(Hi) = Hi,

for i ≥ 1.

Moreover, ρ commutes with the bar involutions, that is, ρ(h) = ρ(h) for h ∈ HDm .
(The bar involution on the left hand side is the bar involution on HDm, while the bar
involution on the right hand side is the bar involution on H1

Bm.)

Proof. It suﬃces to check the relations involving H0. Note that we have

(s0H1s0 − q−1)(s0H1s0 + q) = s0(H1 − q−1)(H1 + q)s0 = 0,

s0H1s0 · H2 · s0H1s0 = s0H1H2H1s0 = s0H2H1H2s0 = H2 · s0H1s0 · H2,

s0H1s0 · Hi = Hi · s0H1s0

for i 6= 2, 0.

This shows that ρ is an embedding of Q(q)-algebras. To show that ρ commutes with
the bar involutions, it suﬃces to show that ρ(H0) = ρ(H0). This is clear since (recall
s0 = s0)

ρ(H0) = ρ(H −1

0 ) = (s0H1s0)−1 = s0H −1

1 s0 = ρ(H0).

The lemma follows.

Via the embedding ρ : HDm → H1

Bm

the tensor space V⊗m as follows (Note that (f (1), f (2), . . . ) · sd

, the Hecke algebra HDm has a natural action on
0 = (−f (2), −f (1), . . . )):

The following corollary follows immediately from Theorem 3.4.

Corollary 3.7.

(1) The action of ((T−1 ⊗ id) · R−1 · (T−1 ⊗ id)) ⊗ idm−2 coincides

with the action of H0 ∈ HDm on V⊗m.

(2) The actions of Uı and HDm on V⊗m commute with each other.

Remark 3.8. The commuting relation of the actions of Uı and HDm on V⊗m has also
been observed in [ES, §7.6] by direct computation without using the Theorem 3.4.

Deﬁnition 3.9. An element f ∈ I m is called (D-)anti-dominant, if |f (1)| ≤ f (2) ≤
f (3) · · · ≤ f (m). (|f (1)| denotes the absolute value of f (1).)

Theorem 3.10. The bar involution ψı : V⊗m → V⊗m is compatible with both the bar
involution of HDm and the bar involution of Uı; that is, for all v ∈ V⊗m, h ∈ HDm ,
and u ∈ Uı, we have

ψı(uvh) = ψı(u) ψı(v)h

and

ψı(Mf ) = Mf for all D-anti-dominant f.

Moreover such bar involution on V⊗m is unique.

Proof. The exact same proof as [BW13, Theorem 5.8] shows that the bar involution
ψı = Υ ◦ ψ is compatible with both the bar involution of H1
and the bar involution
of Uı. But since the embedding ρ : HDm → H0
is compatible with bar involutions
(Proposition 3.6), we know that ψı is compatible with the bar involution of HDm.
Therefore we only need to show that ψı(Mf ) = Mf for all D-anti-dominant f .

Bm

Bm

For any D-anti-dominant f ∈ I m with 0 ≤ f (1), we have ψı(Mf ) = Mf by [BW13,
Theorem 5.8]. For any D-anti-dominant f ∈ I m with f (1) < 0, we see that f · s0 is still
D-anti-dominant and 0 ≤ −f (1) = f (1) · s0. We have

ψı(Mf ) = ψı(Mf ·s0s0) = ψı(Mf ·s0)s0 = Mf ·s0s0 = Mf .

Thus ψı(Mf ) = Mf for all D-anti-dominant f ∈ I m.

The uniqueness of such bar involution on V⊗m follows from a standard argument (cf.
(cid:3)

[BW13, Theorem 5.8]). The theorem follows.

It is well-known that via the action deﬁned in (3.7), the tensor product V⊗m becomes
a direct sum of permutation modules of HDm . Therefore the (parabolic) Kazhdan-
Lusztig basis of HDm induces a (parabolic) Kazhdan-Lusztig basis (of type D) on V⊗m.
Recall that V⊗m admits an ı-canonical basis by Corollary 2.16. The following Corollary
follows immediately from Theorem 3.10.

KAZHDAN-LUSZTIG THEORY OF SUPER TYPE D AND QUANTUM SYMMETRIC PAIRS

17

Corollary 3.11. The ı-canonical basis on the tensor space V⊗m is the same as the
Kazhdan-Lusztig basis of type D.

Remark 3.12. Theorem 3.10 and Corollary 3.11 make sense in the case m = 1 as well,
where we understand WDm as the trivial group. More precisely, the ı-canonical basis
on V is the same as the canonical basis on V.

3.3. Bruhat orderings. In this subsection we show that the bar involution ψı on V⊗m
satisﬁes the type D Burhat ordering, which should be expected in light of Theorem 3.10.
We do not need results from this section for any other part of this paper.

Let X(m) = 1

2 Z[ǫ1, ǫ2, . . . ǫm] and set

ρ = (0ǫ1) − ǫ2 − · · · − (n − 1)ǫn.

There is a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form (·|·) on X(m) such that (ǫi|ǫj) = δij.

There is a natural injective map I m → X(m), deﬁned as

f 7→ λf , where λf =

f (i)ǫi − ρ,

for f ∈ I m.

mXi=1

For any f ∈ I m, the U-weight of Mf is wt(f ) = Pm
Uı-weight of Mf to be wtı(f ) =Pm

Note that we always have λf − λg ∈ Z[ǫ1, . . . , ǫm] for any f, g ∈ I m = I m

i=1 εi, i.e., the image of wt(f ) in the quotient Λθ.

i=1 εf (i) ∈ Λ. We deﬁne the

k (for both

k = 2r + 1 or 2r + 2).

Deﬁnition 3.13. We deﬁne the following two partial orderings on I m.

(1) For any f, g ∈ I m, we say g (cid:22)B f if

wtı(f) = wtı(g)

and

λf − λg = a0(−ǫ1) +

(2) For any f, g ∈ I m, we say g (cid:22)D f if

ai(ǫi − ǫi+1), where ai ∈ N.

m−1Xi=1

g (cid:22)B f

and

g · s0 (cid:22)B f · s0.

(Recall (f (1), . . . ) · s0 = (−f (1), . . . ).)

Proposition 3.14. Let g, f ∈ I m such that g (cid:22)D f .

(1) If m = 1, then f = g.
(2) If m ≥ 2, then we have

λf − λg = a0(−ǫ1 − ǫ2) +

ai(ǫi − ǫi+1),

where ai ∈ N.

m−1Xi=1

Proof. When m = 1, the proposition follows from direct computation. So let us assume
m ≥ 2. It suﬃces to consider the case where

Otherwise we can always ﬁnd h ∈ I m (and then replace g by h) such that g (cid:22)D h (cid:22)D f
and λh − λg ∈ Z[ǫ3, ǫ4, . . . , ǫm], λf − λh ∈ Z[ǫ1, ǫ2]. Thus let us simply assume m = 2.

λf − λg ∈ Z[ǫ1, ǫ2].

We know that wtı(f ) = wtı(g) by our assumption. All elements in I 2 of the same
Uı-weight wtı(f ) has the Hasse diagram with respect to the partial ordering (cid:22)B as the
following (a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0, a ≤ b):

(-a, -b)

(cid:22)B

(-b, -a)

(b, -a)

(-a, b)

(a, -b)

(-b, a)

(b, a)

(a, b)

(cid:22)B

Applying s0 to the vertices, which preserves the Uı-weight wtı(f ), we can rewrite the
Hasse diagram with respect to (cid:22)B as:

(b, -a)

(-b, -a)

(a, b)

(a, -b)

(-a, b)

(-a, -b)

(b, a)

(-b, a)

Combining the two diagrams, we have the following Hasse diagram with respect to

the partial ordering (cid:22)D:

(-a, -b)

(cid:22)D

(-b, -a)

(b, -a)

(-a, b)

(a, -b)

(-b, a)

(b, a)

(a, b)

(cid:22)D

The rest of the proposition follows from case by case computation. For example, we
have

λ(−b,−a) − λ(−b,a) = −2aǫ2 = a(−ǫ1 − ǫ2) + a(ǫ1 − ǫ2).

Remark 3.15. Note that the set {ǫ1, ǫ1 − ǫ2, . . . , ǫm−1 − ǫm}, and the set {ǫ1 + ǫ2, ǫ1 −
ǫ2, . . . , ǫm−1 − ǫm} are the sets of simple roots for type B, and type D root systems,
respectively. So for f , g ∈ I m, g (cid:22)B f means that λf − λg is a non-negative integral
linear combination of type B simple roots, and g (cid:22)D f means that λf − λg is a non-
negative integral linear combination of type D simple roots, respectively.

Remark 3.16. Actually if we know g (cid:22)B f and g · s0 (cid:22)B f · s0, we have

(cid:3)

λf − λg = a0(−ǫ1) +

m−1Xi=1

λf ·s0 − λg·s0 = (2a1 − a0)(−ǫ1) +

But we can write λf − λg as

ai(ǫi − ǫi+1)

where ai ∈ N;

ai(ǫi − ǫi+1)

where ai ∈ N, 2a1 − a0 ∈ N.

m−1Xi=1

2 (a0) and 1

2 (2a1 − a0) ≥ 0. So Proposition 3.14 is essentially
2 (2a1 −a0) are actually integers, if we in addition have wtı(f ) =

In light of the proposition we shall see that the bar involution ψı on the tensor space

V⊗m actually respects the coarser partial ordering (cid:22)D.

Proposition 3.17. For any f ∈ I m, we have

Proof. Following [BW13, Lemma 9.4], we have

ψı(Mf ) = Υψ(Mf ) = Mf + Xg(cid:22)D f
ψı(Mf ) = Υψ(Mf ) = Mf + Xg(cid:22)Bf

cg,f Mg.

cg,f Mg.

Thanks to compatibility in Theorem 3.10, we have

Mf ·s0 + Xg′(cid:22)B f ·s0

cg′,f ·s0Mg′ = ψı(Mf · s0) = ψı(Mf ) · s0 = Mf · s0 + Xg(cid:22)B f

cg,f Mg·s0.

Therefore we have cg′,f ·s0 = cg,f if g′ = g · s0. Thus we have g (cid:22)B f and g · s0 (cid:22)B f · s0.
By Proposition 3.14, this implies g (cid:22)D f . The proposition follows.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.18. We shall NOT use the partial ordering (cid:22)D, or any variation of the this
partial ordering in this paper. It is the partial ordering (cid:22)B and its variants that we
shall use in this paper, which suﬃces to establish the ı-canonical bases and for the
application to the category O.

q(sl2r+1)). We shall add the subscripts to avoid

Let W := V∗ be the (restricted) dual module of V with basis {wa | a ∈ I2r+1} such
that hwa, vbi = (−q)−aδa,b. The action of Uq(sl2r+1) on W is given by the following
formulas (for i ∈ I2r+1, a ∈ I2r+1):

Eαiwa = δi− 1

2 ,awa+1, Fαiwa = δi+ 1

2 ,awa−1, Kαiwa = q−(αi,εa)wa.

By restriction through the embedding ι, W is naturally a Uı
q(sl2r+1)-modules. For
n ∈ Z>0, W⊗n is naturally a Uq(sl2r+1)-module, hence a Uı
q(sl2r+1)-module, via the
iteration of the coproduct ∆. Note that W is an involutive Uq(sl2r+1)-module with ψ
deﬁned as

ψ(wa) = wa,

for all a ∈ I2r+1.

Therefore W⊗n is an involutive Uq(sl2r+1)-module and hence an ı-involutive Uı
module.

Let us ﬁx a choice of ζ in (2.10) such that T−1 : W → W maps w−s to ws, where
s is the largest number in I2r+1. The tensor product W⊗n becomes a direct sum of
permutation modules of HCn via the action deﬁned in (3.8). Hence W⊗n admits a
Kazhdan-Lusztig basis (of type C). The following theorem is the counterpart of the
Theorem 3.4 and Theorem 3.10, Corollary 3.11.

Theorem 3.20 ((Uı

(1) The action of T−1 ⊗ idn−1 coin-

(2) The actions of Uı

4. Kazhdan-Lusztig theory of super type D

In this section we shall apply the theory of ı-canonical bases from Section 2 to study
the BGG category O of the Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n) with respect to various Borel
subalgebras. We shall formulate and establish the Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the Lie
superalgebra osp(2m|2n).

We shall ﬁrst set up various Fock spaces and establish the ı-canonical bases on suit-
able completions of those Fock spaces. Then we study various versions of the category
O of the Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n). Finally we can formulate and establish the
Kazhdan-Lusztig theory for the BGG category O of the Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n).
We emphasize that we shall use the same partial orderings as [BW13, Deﬁnition 8.3],
even though §3.3 suggests that we can use some coarser partial orderings (type B vs
type D). Most proofs shall be similar to [BW13], hence shall be omitted and referred
to [BW13].

4.1. Inﬁnite-rank constructions and notations. We set

Iev = Z.

When it is not necessary to distinguish the even or odd cases, we shall abuse the
notation and simply write I, Iı, I (of course, they have to be consistent, i.e., all even
or all odd.).

We have the natural inclusions of Q(q)-algebras:

· · · ⊂Uq(sl2r+1) ⊂ Uq(sl2r+3) ⊂ · · · ,
· · · ⊂Uq(sl2r+2) ⊂ Uq(sl2r+4) ⊂ · · · ,

· · · ⊂ Uı
· · · ⊂ Uı

q(sl2r+1) ⊂ Uı
q(sl2r+2) ⊂ Uı

q(sl2r+3) ⊂ · · · ,
q(sl2r+4) ⊂ · · · .

Deﬁne the following inﬁnite rank Q(q)-algebras:

Uq(sl2r+2)

and Uı

odd :=

Uı

q(sl2r+2),

Uq(sl2r+1)

and Uı

ev :=

Uı

q(sl2r+1).

We also abuse the notation and simply write the pair (U, Uı) (with the same sub-
scripts). The embeddings of ﬁnite rank algebras induce an embedding of Q(q)-algebras,
denoted also by ι : Uı −→ U. Again U is naturally a Hopf algebra with coproduct
∆, and its restriction under ι, ∆ : Uı → Uı ⊗ U, makes Uı (or more precisely ι(Uı))
naturally a (right) coideal subalgebra of U. The anti-linear bar involutions on ﬁnite
rank algebras induce anti-linear bar involution ψ on U and anti-linear bar involution
ψı on Uı, respectively.

r=0 Π2r+1 (Πev :=
r=0 Π2r+2, respectively) be a simple system of Uodd (Uev, respectively). We again

shall write Π for both Πodd and Πev. Recall we denote the integral weight lattice of Uk
by Λk. Then let

Λodd := ⊕i∈IoddZ[εi] =

Λ2r+1

and Λev := ⊕i∈Iev Z[εi] =

Λ2r+2

∞[r=0

∞[r=0

be the integral weight lattice of Uodd and Uev, respectively. Thus by abuse of notations,
we have (for both cases)

Λ = ⊕i∈I Z[εi].

Following §1.1, we have the quotient lattice Λθ of the lattice Λ.

Following [BW13, §8.1] we can deﬁne the intertwiner Υ (which lies in some comple-

tion of U−) for the quantum symmetric pair (U, Uı) such that

Υ := Xµ∈NΠ

Υµ, Υµ ∈ U−
µ .

We shall see that Υ is a well-deﬁned operator on U-modules that we are concerned.

4.2. The Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n). In this subsection, we recall some basics on
ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebras and set up notations to be used later on (cf. [CW]
for more on Lie superalgebras).

Let Z2 = {0, 1}. Let C2m|2n be a superspace of dimension (2m|2n) with basis {ei |
1 ≤ i ≤ 2m} ∪ {ej | 1 ≤ j ≤ 2n}, where the Z2-grading is given by the following parity
function:

p(ei) = 0,

p(ej) = 1

(∀i, j).

Let B be a non-degenerate even supersymmetric bilinear form on C2m|2n. The general
linear Lie superalgebra gl(2m|2n) is the Lie superalgebra of linear transformations on
C2m|2n (in matrix form with respect to the above basis). For s ∈ Z2, we deﬁne
osp(2m|2n)s := {g ∈ gl(2m|2n)s | B(g(x), y) = −(−1)s·p(x)B(x, g(y))},
osp(2m|2n) := osp(2m|2n)0 ⊕ osp(2m|2n)1.

We now give a matrix realization of the Lie superalgebra osp(2m|2n). Take the
supersymmetric bilinear form B with the following matrix form, with respect to the
basis (e1, e2, . . . , e2m, e1, e2, . . . , e2n):

Let Ei,j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 2m, and Ek,h, 1 ≤ k, h ≤ 2n, be the (i, j)th and (k, h)th
elementary matrices, respectively. The Cartan subalgebra of osp(2m|2n) of diagonal
matrices is denoted by hm|n, which is spanned by

We denote by {ǫi, ǫj | 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n} the basis of h∗

m|n such that

ǫa(Hb) = δa,b,

for a, b ∈ {i, j | 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n}.

We denote the lattice of integral weights of osp(2m|2n) by

The supertrace form on osp(2m|2n) induces a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear

form on h∗

m|n denoted by (·|·), such that

(ǫi|ǫa) = δi,a,

(ǫj|ǫa) = −δj,a,

for a ∈ {i, j | 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n}.

We have the following root system of osp(2m|2n) with respect to hm|n
Φ = Φ0 ∪ Φ1 = {±ǫi ± ǫj, ±ǫk ± ǫl, ±2ǫq} ∪ {±ǫp ± ǫq},

where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, 1 ≤ p ≤ n, 1 ≤ q ≤ m, 1 ≤ k < l ≤ m.

In this paper we shall need to deal with various Borel subalgebras, hence various
simple systems of Φ. Let b = (b1, b2, . . . , bm+n) be a sequence of m + n integers such
that m of the bi’s are equal to 0 and n of them are equal to 1. We call such a sequence
a 0m1n-sequence. Associated to each 0m1n-sequence b = (b1, . . . , bm+n), we have the
following fundamental system Πb, and hence a positive system Φ+
b,¯1, of
the root system Φ of osp(2m|2n):

though their corresponding Dynkin diagrams look quite diﬀerent.

vectors in osp(2m|2n). Then we obtain a triangular decomposition of osp(2m|2n):

b to be the nilpotent subalgebra spanned by the positive/negative root

with n+

b ⊕ hm|n as a Borel subalgebra.

Fix a 0m1n-sequence b and hence a positve system Φ+

b . We denote by Z(osp(2m|2n))
the center of the enveloping algebra U (osp(2m|2n)). There exists a standard projection
φ : U (osp(2m|2n)) → U (hm|n) which is consistent with the PBW basis associated to
the above triangular decomposition ([CW, §2.2.3]). For λ ∈ h∗
m|n, we deﬁne the central

χλ(z) := λ(φ(z)),

Denote the Weyl group of (the even subalgebra of) osp(2m|2n) by Wosp, which is

BGG categories for ortho-symplectic Lie superalgebras.

Deﬁnition 4.4. Let b be a 0m1n-sequence. The Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG)
category Ob (= Ob,ev or Ob,odd, respectively) is the category of hm|n-semisimple osp(2m|2n)-
modules M such that

modules.

Nα, for some i.

If the 0m1n-sequence b starts with 0, then we are interested in both Ob,ev and Ob,odd.

If the 0m1n-sequence b starts with 1, then we are interested in only Ob,ev.

Similar to [CLW15, Proposition 6.4], all these categories Ob are identical for various
b ⊕ hm|n are identical and the

b, since the even subalgebras of the Borel subalgebras n+
odd parts of these Borels always act locally nilpotently.

It is well known that the Lie superalgebra gl(2m|2n) has an automorphism τ given

by the formula:

τ (Eij) := −(−1)p(i)(p(i)+p(j))Eji.

The restriction of τ on osp(2m|2n) gives an automorphism of osp(2m|2n). For an object
M = ⊕µ∈X(m|n)Mµ ∈ Ob, we let

M ∨ := ⊕µ∈X(m|n)M ∗
µ

be the restrictd dual of M . We deﬁne the action of osp(2m|2n) on M ∨ by (g · f )(x) :=
−f (τ (g) · x), for f ∈ M ∨, g ∈ osp(2m|2n), and x ∈ M . We denote the resulting module
by M τ .

An object M ∈ Ob is said to have a b-Verma ﬂag (respectively, dual b-Verma ﬂag),
if M has a ﬁltration 0 = M0 ⊆ M1 ⊆ M2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Mt = M, such that Mi/Mi−1 ∼=
Mb(γi), 1 ≤ i ≤ t (respectively, Mi/Mi−1 ∼= M τ

b(γi)) for some γi ∈ X(m|n).

Associated to each λ ∈ X(m|n), a b-tilting module Tb(λ) is an indecomposable
osp(2m|2n)-module in Ob characterized by the following two conditions: Tb(λ) has a
b-Verma ﬂag with Mb(λ) at the bottom; Ext1
Ob(Mb(µ), Tb(λ)) = 0, for all µ ∈ X(m|n).

4.4. Fock spaces and their completions. Let V := Pa∈I Q(q)va be the natural

representation of U, where the action of U on V is deﬁned as follows (for i ∈ I, a ∈ I):

Eαiva = δi+ 1

2 ,ava−1, Fαi va = δi− 1

2 ,ava+1, Kαiva = q(αi,εa)va.

Let W := V∗ be the restricted dual module of V with basis {wa | a ∈ I} such that
hwa, vbi = (−q)−aδa,b. The action of U on W is given by the following formulas (for
i ∈ I, a ∈ I):

Eαiwa = δi− 1

2 ,awa−1, Kαiwa = q−(αi,εa)wa.
By restriction through the embedding ι, V and W are naturally Uı-modules.

2 ,awa+1, Fαiwa = δi+ 1

Fix a 0m1n-sequence b = (b1, b2, . . . , bm+n). We have the following tensor space over

Q(q), called the b-Fock space or simply Fock space:

Let b = (b1, · · · , bm+n) be an arbitrary 0m1n-sequence. We ﬁrst deﬁne a partial

4.5. Translation functors. In [Br1], Brundan established a U-module isomorphism
between the Grothendieck group of the category O of gl(m|n) and a Fock space (at
q = 1), where some properly deﬁned translation functors acting as Chevalley generators
of U at q = 1.
In [BW13], the analogue in the setting of osp(2m + 1|2n) has been
developed. Here we generalize the construction to the setting of the Lie superalgebra
osp(2m|2n).

Let V be the natural osp(2m|2n)-module. Notice that V is self-dual. Recalling §4.2,

we have the following decomposition of Ob (for ﬁxed b):

Ob =Mχλ

Ob,χλ,

where χλ runs over all integral or half-integral central characters, i.e. λ runs over
the equivalent classes X(m|n)/ ∼ (recall this means Xev(m|n)/ ∼ or Xodd(m|n)/ ∼,
respectively).

We write Ob,γ := ⊕χλ

= γ ∈ Λθ. For r ≥ 0, let SrV
be the rth supersymmetric power of V . For i ∈ Iı, M ∈ Ob,γ, we deﬁne the following
translation functors in Ob:

Ob,χλ for all λ such that εf b

Note that the (exact) translation functors naturally induce operators on the Grothendieck

αi , and t as well. The following two lemmas are analoges

group [O∆
of [Br1, Lemmas 4.23 and 4.24]. Since they are standard, we shall skip the proofs.
Lemma 4.11. On the category Ob, the translation functors f (r)
exact. They commute with the τ -duality.
Lemma 4.12. Let ν1, . . . , νN be the set of weights of SrV ordered so that vi > vj if
and only if i < j. Let λ ∈ X(m|n). Then Mb(λ) ⊗ SrV has a multiplicity-free Verma
ﬂag with subquotients isomorphic to Mb(λ + ν1), . . . , Mb(λ + νN ) in the order from
bottom to top.

Proof. This proof is essentially the same induction as the one in [BW13, Theorem 11.13]
(or its predecessor [CLW15]). The setting on the Fock spaces is exactly the same as
[BW13], since the only diﬀerence is the precise formula of the bar involution ψı. (Recall
we are using the same partial ordering as in [BW13].) Hence here we will be contented
with specifying how each step follows and refer the reader to the proof of [BW13,
Theorem 11.13] (and the references therein) for details.

The inductive procedure case (1), denoted by ıKL(m|n) ∀m ≥ 2 =⇒ ıKL(m|n + 1), is

divided into the following steps:

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

ıKL(m + k|n) ∀k =⇒ ıKL(m|n|k) ∀k, by changing Borels

=⇒ ıKL(m|n|k) ∀k, by passing to parabolic

=⇒ ıKL(m|n|∞), by taking k 7→ ∞

=⇒ ıKL(m|n + ∞), by super duality

=⇒ ıKL(m|n + 1) ∀m, by truncation.

It is instructive to write down the Fock spaces corresponding to the steps above:

V⊗(m+k) ⊗ W⊗n ∀k =⇒ V⊗m ⊗ W⊗n ⊗ V⊗k ∀k
=⇒ V⊗m ⊗ W⊗n ⊗ ∧kV ∀k
=⇒ V⊗m ⊗ W⊗n ⊗ ∧∞V
=⇒ V⊗m ⊗ W⊗n ⊗ ∧∞W

30

HUANCHEN BAO

=⇒ V⊗m ⊗ W⊗(n+1) ∀m ≥ 2.

Thanks to Theorem 3.10 and Corollary 3.11, the base case for the induction, ıKL(m|0),
is equivalent to the original Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture [KL] for so(2m).

Step (4.14) follows from [BW13, Proposition 11.14].
Step (4.15) follows from [BW13, §11.2].
Step (4.16) follows from [BW13, Proposition 11.4].
Step (4.17) is based on [BW13, Proposition 11.12].
Step (4.18) is based on [BW13, Propositions 7.7, 11.4 and 9.17].
The inductive procedure for case (2), denoted by ıKL(n|m) ∀n ≥ 1 =⇒ ıKL(n|m + 1),

is divided into the following steps:

(4.19)

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

ıKL(n + k|m) ∀k =⇒ ıKL(n|m|k) ∀k, by changing Borels

=⇒ ıKL(n|m|k) ∀k, by passing to parabolic

=⇒ ıKL(n|m|∞), by taking k 7→ ∞

=⇒ ıKL(n|m + ∞), by super duality

=⇒ ıKL(n|m + 1) ∀n, by truncation.

The Fock spaces corresponding to the steps above are the following:

W⊗(n+k) ⊗ V⊗m ∀k =⇒ W⊗n ⊗ V⊗m ⊗ W⊗k ∀k
=⇒ W⊗n ⊗ V⊗m ⊗ ∧kW ∀k
=⇒ W⊗n ⊗ V⊗m ⊗ ∧∞W
=⇒ W⊗n ⊗ V⊗m ⊗ ∧∞V
=⇒ W⊗n ⊗ V⊗(m+1) ∀n ≥ 1.

Thanks to Theorem 3.20, the base case for the induction, ıKL(n|0), is equivalent to the
original Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture [KL] for sp(2n). The rest of the proof is similar
to the previous case.

The theorem is proved.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.16. There is a similar Fock space formulation for various parabolic subcate-
gories of osp(2m|2n)-modules.
