Abstract

Quantum information theory determines the maximum rates at which information can be transmitted
through physical systems described by quantum mechanics. Here we consider the communication proto-
col known as quantum reading. Quantum reading is a protocol for retrieving the information stored in a digital
memory by using a quantum probe, e.g., shining quantum states of light to read an optical memory. In a vari-
ety of situations using a quantum probe enhances the performances of the reading protocol in terms of ﬁdelity,
data density and energy dissipation. Here we review and characterize the quantum reading capacity of a mem-
ory model, deﬁned as the maximum rate of reliable reading. We show that, like other quantities in quantum
information theory, the quantum reading capacity is super-additive. Moreover, we determine conditions under
which the use of an entangled ancilla improves the performance of quantum reading.

1 Introduction

The scope of quantum information theory is to determine how and how much information can be stored, pro-
cessed, and transmitted through physical systems behaving according to the laws of quantum mechanics [1].
In particular, one is interested in transmitting classical or quantum information, possibly in the presence of
physical constraints (e.g., limited energy of bandwidth) or additional resources (e.g., quantum entanglement or
feedback communication) [2].

In the most common setting, one is given a quantum communication channel, that is, a physical process that
transforms quantum states at the input into quantum states at the output, as for example an optical ﬁber does,
see e.g., [3, 4]. A channel of this kind is also called a quantum-quantum (QQ) channel. Another kind of channel
is the so-called classical-quantum (CQ) channel, which maps classical states (that is, probability distribution
over a set of symbols) into quantum states. To send classical information through a QQ channel, the sender
(Alice) ﬁrst encodes classical states into quantum states by applying a suitable CQ channel at the input of the
QQ channel, as represented in Figure 1a). In this setting, the CQ channel plays the role of an encoding map. At
the other end of the QQ channel, the receiver (BOB) collects the output and measures it to decode the classical
information sent by Alice.

Quantum reading (QR) is a communication protocol that is based on a different rationale [5, 6]. Instead of
having a given communication channel and encoding classical information by choosing the input states, in QR
the sender encodes information by choosing an element from a collection of QQ channels. Then, to decode, the
receiver probes the QQ channels with a quantum states, collects the output and measures it.

The prototypical example of QR is that of an optical memory, e.g. a CD or DVD, where information is
encoded in a memory cell by means of the physical properties of the substrate, e.g., its reﬂectivity or phase.
For this reason, QR has been mainly considered in the context of optical realizations [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15]. For example, a memory cell with low or high reﬂectivity may encode a logical ”0” or ”1”. To read
this information the receiver must shine a laser beam on the memory cell, and the collect the reﬂected beam
(see Figure 2). There are proven advantages in using quantum states of light to perform this task, for instance
increased ﬁdelity and data density, reduced energy consumption and dissipation [5].

ing map. b) In quantum reading the encoding is represented by a control-QQ channel.

Figure 2: An optical memories is the prototype of quantum reading.

From a more abstract point of view, QR can be represented as shown in Figure 1b). The encoding of a
symbol x belonging to an alphabet X can be modeled as a control-QQ channel (a generalization of a control-
unitary channel [1]) where the value of x determines which of the QQ channel in a set Φ = {φx}x∈X should be
applied.
Following [6] we refer to the set Φ = {φx}x∈X as a “memory cell”. One can deﬁne the quantum reading
capacity of Φ as the maximum rate (in bits per use of the memory cell) that can be reliably transmitted from the
sender to the receiver using the encoding procedure speciﬁed by Φ. Indeed, in previous works several notions
of capacity have been deﬁned according to which constraints are assumed or additional resources are allowed
[6]. In this paper we present further results concerning quantum reading capacities, in particular we show that
QR capacity is super-additive, and discuss under which conditions the assistance of entanglement enhances the
QR capacity.

The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we review a few basic notions and deﬁnitions. In Section 3 we
analyze the case of noiseless QR. The property of super-additivity of QR is discussed in Section 4, and the case
of noisy QR is considered in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 is devoted to zero-error QR capacity, and Section 7 is
for conclusions.

2 Quantum reading capacities

A QR protocol comprises an encoding and a decoding stage. During the encoding stage, which is essen-
tially classical, the sender Alice encodes messages i = 1, 2, . . . , M using codewords of length n, xn(i) =
x1(i)x2(i)··· xn(i), where xk(i) ∈ X . Each codeword identiﬁes a corresponding sequence of quantum chan-
nels from the memory cell Φ = {φx}x∈X , e.g., φn
xn(i). During the decoding
stage, the receiver Bob prepares a state ρn, also called a transmitter, which is used to probe the sequence of
quantum channels φn

xn(i). Finally, Bob collects and measures the output to retrieve the encoded message.

xn(i) = φn

x1(i) ⊗ φn

x2(i) ⊗ ··· φn

In analogy with other quantum communication protocol we introduce the following deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 1 (Quantum Reading protocol) A (M, n, ǫ)-QR protocol for a memory cell Φ = {φx}x∈X is de-
ﬁned by an encoding map E from i = 1, . . . , M to X ⊗n, a transmitter state ρn, and a measurement with POVM

2

elements {Λ(j)}j∈J , such that the average probability of error in decoding is less than ǫ, that is,

1

M Xi Xj6=i

TrhΛ(j) φn

E(i)(ρn)i ≤ ǫ .

The rate of the QR protocol is R = 1

n log M .

Deﬁnition 2 (Quantum Reading capacity) The QR capacity of a given memory cell Φ is deﬁned as

C(Φ) = sup(cid:26)lim

n

sup

1
n

log Mn : lim
n

ǫn = 0(cid:27) ,

where the sup is over all sequences of (Mn, n, ǫn)-QR protocols.

We now introduce some notions of constrained QR capacities. Instead of considering a generic state for the
transmitter, we can restrict to the family of QR protocols for which the transmitter has the form, ρn = ρ⊗n, that
is, it is a separable state across different uses of the memory cell. The maximum QR rate that can be achieved
under this constraint is deﬁned as C1(Φ). We have

C1(Φ) = max

ρ

C1(Φ|ρ) ,

(1)

where C1(Φ|ρ) denotes the maximum QR rate achievable for a given ρ. Applying known results of quantum
information theory [16, 17], the latter can be expressed as:

χ ({px, φx(ρ)}x∈X )
where the maximum is over all probability distribution over the alphabet X ,

C1(Φ|ρ) = max

{px}x∈X

χ ({px, φx(ρ)}x∈X ) = S Xx∈X

pxφx(ρ)! − Xx∈X

px S (φx(ρ)) ,

(2)

(3)

is the Holevo information, and S (σ) = −Tr (σ log σ) denotes the von Neumann entropy. It can be easily shown
that the maximum is indeed obtained when ρ is a pure state [6].
Similarly we can deﬁne the QR capacities Ck(Φ), for k = 1, 2, . . . , where the transmitter state is separable
across pairs, triplets, etc., of different uses of the memory cell, that is, ρn = ρk⊗(n/k) (for n multiple of k). We
have

Clearly C(Φ) ≥ Ck(Φ) ≥ Ch(Φ) for k > h. If the inequality is strict, that is, Ck(Φ) > C1(Φ) for some k, we
say that the C(Φ) is super-additive.
More generally, the transmitter state can be chosen to be entangled with an ancilla, which Bob retains and
measures jointly, see Figure 3. In this case we speak of entanglement-assisted QR. Notice that an entanglement-
assisted QR protocol for a memory cell Φ = {φx} is equivalent to an unassisted protocol for the extended
memory cell Φ⊗id = {φx⊗id}, where id denotes the identity channel acting on the ancilla. The entanglement-
assisted QR capacity is hence given by the expression

CEA(Φ) = C(Φ ⊗ id) .

(5)

EA(Φ) by constraining the transmitter to be separable
Similarly, we can deﬁne the assisted QR capacities Ck
EA(Φ) ≥ Ck(Φ). If, for
across groups of k uses of the memory cell. Clearly, we have CEA(Φ) ≥ C(Φ), and Ck
some value of k, this inequality is strict we say that the assistance of entanglement enhances the QR capacity
Ck(Φ) of the memory cell.

3 Noiseless quantum reading

We ﬁrst consider a noiseless setting in which the QQ channels in the memory cell are unitary transformations,
that is, φx(ρ) = UxρU †
x. For the sake of simplicity we consider the binary setting, x ∈ {0, 1}, with the unitaries
acting in a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space of dimension d.

Let us consider the Holevo information,

χ(cid:16)(cid:8)px, Ux|ψihψ|U †

x(cid:9)x=0,1(cid:17) = Shp U0 |ψihψ| U †

1i
0 + (1 − p) U1 |ψihψ| U †

= S(cid:2)p |ψihψ| + (1 − p) U |ψihψ| U †(cid:3) ,

where p = p0, and U = U †
0 U1. From Equation (2) we obtain C1 by maximization of the Holevo information.
This is equivalent to maximizing the von Neuman entropy of the state σ = p|ψihψ| + (1 − p)U|ψihψ|U †. In
order to do that, it is convenient to introduce an unit vector |ψ⊥i such that hψ|ψ⊥i = 0 and

In the system of orthonormal vectors |ψi, |ψ⊥i, the state σ is represented by the density matrix:

U|ψi = α|ψi +p1 − |α|2|ψ⊥i .

˜σ =(cid:18)

p + (1 − p)|α|2
(1 − p)α∗p1 − |α|2

(1 − p)αp1 − |α|2
(1 − p)(1 − |α|2) (cid:19) .

The maximum von Neumann entropy of σ is achieved in correspondence to the maximum determinant of the
matrix ˜σ. We have,

det ˜σ = p(1 − p)(1 − |α|2) ,

(10)
which is maximized for p = 1/2 and in correspondence of the minimum value of |α|2 = |hψ|U|ψi|2. Let us
denote as {|ji}j=0,...,d−1 the eigenvectors of U , and as eiθj the corresponding eigenvalues. We expand |ψi
in the basis of eigenvectors, |ψi = Pj ψj|ji, which yields α = Pj |ψj|2eiθj . The reading capacity is hence
obtained by putting α = αmin, with

|αmin|2 =

min

{ψj }| Pj |ψj|2=1Xjj′

|ψj|2 |ψj′|2 ei(θj −θj′ ) ,

which ﬁnally yields

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(11)

(12)

C1 = h(cid:18) 1 − |α|min

2

(cid:19) ,

Let us now consider the entanglement-assisted QR capacity C1

where h(x) = −x log x − (1 − x) log (1 − x).
EA we can repeat the
reasoning of above with U replaced by U ⊗ I. Notice that U ⊗ I has the same eigenvalues of U (but with
higher multiplicity). We can then consider a system of eigenvectors of U ⊗ I, denoted as {|jki}, where |jki
are the eigenvectors with shared eigenvalue eiθj . Expanding the transmitter state |ψi in this basis we obtain
|ψi = Pjk ψjk|jki, which yields α = Pjk |ψjk|2eiθj = Pj(Pk |ψjk|2)eiθj . We then obtain the same
expression for |αmin|2 as in Equation (11) upon replacingPk |ψjk|2 → |ψj|2. In conclusion, we have obtained

E, that is, the assistance of entanglement does not enhance the QR capacity C1 in the noiseless

EA. To compute C1

As an example, let us consider the case of qubit unitaries (d = 2). We have |ψi = ψ0|0i + ψ1|1i and

|αmin|2 =

{ψ0,ψ1}:|ψ0|2+|ψ1|2=1|ψ0|4 + |ψ1|4 + 2|ψ0|2|ψ1|2 cos (δθ) ,

with δθ = |θ1 − θ0|. The minimum is hence obtained for |ψ0|2 = |ψ1|2 = 1/2 and yields

|αmin| =r 1 + cos (δθ)

= |cos (δθ/2)| .

C1 = h(cid:16)sin (δθ/4)2(cid:17) .

Finally from (12) we obtain

4 Super-additivity

(13)

(14)

(15)

Let us consider the case of a binary memory cell composed of two qubit unitary transformations, U0 and U1.
We now show that this cell exhibits the phenomenon of super-additivity.

For given k > 1, let us consider the Holevo information χk = χ ({pxk , φxk (|ψihψ|)}) in Equation (4)
with a probability distribution such that p00···0 = p11···1 = 1/2. That is, we are only considering, with equal
probability, the unitary transformations U ⊗k

. The Holevo information then reads

Let us denote the eigenvectors of U as |0i and |1i, with corresponding eigenvalues eiθ0 and eiθ1. As a

transmitter state we chose the entangled state |ψi = (|0i⊗k + |1i⊗k)/√2. We then obtain

We hence have found that for any k there exist values of δθ such that Ck > C1, that is, QR is super-additive.
We can also write a lower bound on the ultimate QR capacity, that is,

Ck ≥

5 Noisy quantum reading

Going beyond the case of noiseless quantum reading, we consider a simple yet physically motivated example
of noisy binary quantum reading where the two encoding maps are of the form

φx(ρ) = (1 − q) Ux ρ U †

x + q ρ0 ,

(19)

where ρ0 is the maximally mixed state in d dimensions, with x = 0, 1 and q ∈ [0, 1].

Let us ﬁrst consider the QR capacity C1. Putting U = U †

0 U1, the Holevo information in Equation (2) reads

χ = S(cid:0)(1 − q)(cid:0)p0|ψihψ| + p1U|ψihψ|U †(cid:1) + q ρ0(cid:1) − S(cid:0)(1 − q)U|ψihψ|U † + q ρ0(cid:1)
= S(cid:0)(1 − q)(cid:0)p0|ψihψ| + p1U|ψihψ|U †(cid:1) + q ρ0(cid:1) − η(1 − q + q/d) − (d − 1)η(q/d) ,

where η(y) = −y log y. The maximization of the Holevo information is thus reduced to the maximization of
the von Neumann entropy of the state σ = (1 − q)(cid:0)p0|ψihψ| + p1U|ψihψ|U †(cid:1) + q ρ0. It is convenient to
expand this state in a basis deﬁned by the vector |ψi, the vector |ψ⊥i (such that hψ|ψ⊥i = 0 and U|ψi =
α|ψi +p1 − |α|2|ψ⊥i), and any other set of d− 2 vectors. In this basis the state σ is represented by the density
matrix

(20)
(21)

The maximum von Neumann entropy of σ corresponds to the maximum determinant of ˜σ, where

d

˜σ =(cid:18) (1 − q)[p + (1 − p)|α|2] + q
(1 − q)(1 − p)α∗p1 − |α|2
det ˜σ =(cid:18)p(1 − p)(1 − q)2(1 − |α|2) +

(23)

For any given q, the determinant is maximized for p = (1 − p) = 1/2 and in correspondence of the minimum
value of |α|2. We hence obtain
C1 = η(cid:18) q
where |αmin| is given by Equation (11).

5.1 Entanglement assisted reading

Unlike the noiseless case, the assistance of entanglement can be beneﬁcial in the noisy setting. We consider the
entanglement-assisted QR capacity C1
EA, which can be computed by maximization of the Holevo information

χ = S(cid:0)(1 − q)(cid:0)p0|ψihψ| + p1(U ⊗ I)|ψihψ|(U † ⊗ I)(cid:1) + q ρ0 ⊗ ρA(cid:1)
− S(cid:0)(1 − q)(U ⊗ I)|ψihψ|(U † ⊗ I) + q ρ0 ⊗ ρA(cid:1) .

where |ψi is a joint pure state for the BA system, comprising both Bob output and the ancillary system, and
ρA = TrB(|ψihψ|) denotes the reduced state of the ancilla. Without loss of generality we can assume that the
dimension of the ancilla A equals that of Bob system B. Moreover, as an example we take |ψi to be a maximally
entangled state in the BA system, which implies ρA = ρ0 = I/d. We then obtain

(26)
(27)

χ =S(cid:18)(1 − q)(cid:0)p0|ψihψ| + p1(U ⊗ I)|ψihψ|(U † ⊗ I)(cid:1) + q

where |α|2 = |hψ|U ⊗ I|ψi|2 and |ψi is a maximally entangled state.
For the sake of simplicity, let us now consider the case d = 2 and consider a system of eigenvectors of U ⊗ I,
denoted as {|jki}, where |jki is an eigenvector with eigenvalue eiθj . The maximally entangled state ψ can be
represented, without loss of generality, as |ψi = Pj=0,1 2−1/2|jji, which implies α = 1
2Pj=0,1 eiθj and in
turn yields |α| = | cos (δθ/2)|. Substituting this value for α in Equation (32) with d = 2 we obtain

+ (1 − q) cos (δθ/4)2(cid:17) + η(cid:16) q

is beneﬁcial (that is, C1

6 Zero-error capacity

QR is closely related to the problem of quantum channel discrimination [5, 6]. The particular case of noiseless
QR is hence in close relation with the problem of discriminating between two unitary transformations. Ac-
cording to [18], two unitaries , U0 and U1, can always be perfectly discriminated, if enough copies of them are
provided and using a suitable input state and, possibly, a collective measurement. To relate in a formal way
this feature of the problem of unitary discrimination with QR, we need to consider the notion of zero-error QR
capacity.

Deﬁnition 3 (Zero-error quantum reading protocol) A (M, n) zero-error QR protocol for a memory cell
Φ = {φx}x∈X is deﬁned by an encoding map E from i = 1, . . . , M to X ⊗n, a transmitter state ρn, and a
measurement with POVM elements {Λ(j)}j∈J , such that the average probability of error in decoding is zero.
The rate of the QR protocol is R = 1

n log M .

From the deﬁnition of zero-error QR protocol it follows that of zero-error QR capacity as the maximum
zero-error QR rate. Coming back to the results of [18], let us consider the case of two-dimensional unitaries
(extension to the higher dimension is straightforward). Given that the spectrum of the unitary U = U †
0 U1
is eiθ0, eiθ1, [18] proved that the unitaries U ⊗n
are perfectly distinguishable if n ≥ π/δθ (with
δθ = |θ0 − θ1|). This result implies that the zero-error QR capacity of the binary unitary memory cell is

and U ⊗n

7 Conclusions

We have presented several new results concerning the properties of super-additivity and the use of entanglement
as a resource to enhance the QR capacities. We have proven that the assistance of entanglement does not
increase the QR capacity in the noiseless setting, where the memory cell consists of unitary transformations.
On the contrary, we have shown with an example that the assistance of entanglement may enhance the QR
capacity when the memory cell consists of noisy quantum channels. We have also shown that the QR capacity,
like other quantities in quantum information theory [19, 20], exhibits the phenomenon of super-additivity.

As already pointed out in previous works [5, 6], the protocol of QR is closely related to the task of quantum
channel discrimination. For example, the fact that the assistance of entanglement enhances the QR capacity for a
noisy memory cell, mirrors the fact that the use of an entangled ancilla may improve the discrimination between
quantum channels (see e.g. [21]). At a more formal level, the analogy between QR and quantum channel
discrimination can be appreciated through the notion of zero-error QR capacity, as discussed in Section 6. QR
is also closely related to the task of parameter estimation, see e.g. [22] (this connection was also discussed in
[23]). For example, notice that the QR capacity is super-additive in the region of small values of δθ (see Figure
4). This is the regime in which discriminating between two unitaries is essentially equivalent to estimating a
small variation of the value of a relative phase.
