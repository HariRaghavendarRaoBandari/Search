Abstract

We consider a general non-Abelian renormalizable N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory,
regularized by higher covariant derivatives without breaking the BRST invariance, and cal-
culate one-loop divergences for a general form of higher derivative regulator and of the gauge
ﬁxing term. It is demonstrated that the momentum integrals giving the one-loop β-function
are integrals of double total derivatives independently of a particular choice of the higher
derivative term. Evaluating them we reproduce the well-known result for the one-loop β-
function. Also we ﬁnd that the three-point ghost vertices with a single line of the quantum
gauge superﬁeld are not renormalized in the considered approximation.

Introduction

The well-known non-renormalization theorem [1] states that in N = 1 supersymmetric gauge
theories the superpotential does not receive divergent quantum corrections. Moreover, there is
one more interesting feature of quantum corrections in these theories. Namely, the renormal-
ization of the coupling constant is related to the renormalization of the matter superﬁelds by
the so-called exact NSVZ β-function [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8]. For the general N = 1 supersymmetric
Yang–Mills (SYM) theory with matter it is written as

β(α, λ) = −

α2(cid:16)3C2 − T (R) + C(R)i

2π(1 − C2α/2π)

j(γφ)j

i(α, λ)/r(cid:17)

,

(1)

where (γφ)j
notation is used:

i denotes the anomalous dimension of the chiral matter superﬁelds and the following

tr (T AT B) ≡ T (R) δAB;
f ACDf BCD ≡ C2δAB;

k(T A)k

(T A)i
r ≡ δAA.

j ≡ C(R)i

j;

(2)

(It is assumed that the generators of the fundamental representation tA are normalized by the
condition tr(tAtB) = δAB/2.)

In the early papers the NSVZ β-function was obtained from general arguments, such as
the structure of instanton contributions to the eﬀective action [2, 6], anomalies [3, 5, 9], non-
renormalization of the topological term [10]. However, it was also necessary to construct the

1

subtraction scheme in which the NSVZ β-function is valid. The explicit loop calculations [11, 12,
13, 14, 15] (see [16] for a review) made with the dimensional reduction [18] in the DR-scheme
agree with the NSVZ β-function only after a special ﬁnite renormalization which should be
constructed in each order [12, 17]. Up to now, there is no general prescription how to do it in an
arbitrary order. However, a possibility of making this ﬁnite renormalization is nontrivial [12],
because from the general equation which describes how the NSVZ expression is changed under
a ﬁnite renormalization [19, 20] one can derive some scheme independent consequences of the
NSVZ relation [20, 21].

At least in the Abelian case, the NSVZ scheme can be naturally constructed if the super-
symmetric theories are regularized by higher covariant derivatives [22, 23]. This regularization is
mathematically consistent unlike the dimensional reduction [24]. (Removing the inconsistencies
of the dimensional reduction leads to the loss of the explicit supersymmetry [25], which can
be in this case broken by higher order quantum corrections [26, 27, 28].) The higher covariant
derivative regularization can be formulated in the explicitly N = 1 supersymmetric way [29, 30],
It can be also used for regularization of N = 2
so that it does not break supersymmetry.
supersymmetric theories [31, 32, 33].

With the higher covariant derivative regularization the NSVZ relation was derived for the
Abelian supersymmetric theories in all orders for the renormalization group (RG) functions
deﬁned in terms of the bare coupling constant [34, 35] (which are scheme-independent for a ﬁxed
regularization [36]). The RG functions deﬁned in the standard way in terms of the renormalized
coupling constant [37] satisfy the NSVZ relation only in the NSVZ scheme which in this case
can be constructed in all orders by imposing simple boundary conditions on the renormalization
constants [36, 20]. Thus, the NSVZ scheme can be easily constructed with the Slavnov higher
derivative regularization. The main feature of quantum corrections, which allows to do this, is
the factorization of integrals for the β-function (deﬁned in terms of the bare coupling constant)
into integrals of (double) total derivatives in the momentum space in the limit of the vanishing
external momentum [38, 39].
In the Abelian case this has been proved in all orders [34, 35]
and conﬁrmed by explicit calculations in the three-loop approximation [40]. Using a similar
method it has been proved that the integrals for the Adler D-function [41] (deﬁned in terms of
the bare coupling constant) in N = 1 supersymmetric QCD are also integrals of double total
derivatives in all orders. This feature allows to relate this function to the anomalous dimension
of the matter superﬁelds exactly in all orders [42, 43]. This new relation is similar to the NSVZ
β-function and has a similar origin.

In the non-Abelian case the calculations of the β-function with the higher covariant deriva-
tive regularization were made only in the two-loop order [44, 45], where it was demonstrated that
all momentum integrals giving the β-function are integrals of total derivatives. Subsequently,
the results of the papers [44, 45] were written in the form of integrals of double total derivatives
[46, 47, 48]. However, the versions of the higher covariant derivative regularization which were
used for making explicit calculations for the non-Abelian N = 1 supersymmetric theories break
the BRST invariance [49, 50] (while the background gauge invariance is not broken). Then the
calculations are much simpler in comparison with the version of the higher derivative regulariza-
tion which does not break the BRST invariance. Certainly, using of non-invariant regularizations
is possible (see, e.g., [51, 52, 53, 54]), if they are supplemented by a subtraction scheme which
restores the Slavnov–Taylor identities [55, 56]. However, it is much more convenient to make
calculations with the invariant regularization. Moreover, the invariant regularization may be
useful for the general derivation of the NSVZ relation in the non-Abelian case. That is why in
the present paper we consider a more complicated version of the higher derivative regularization
which does not break the BRST invariance and a very general forms of the higher derivative
term and of the gauge ﬁxing term. In this case the calculations are much more complicated.
That is why here we make them only in the one-loop approximation. Certainly, in the one-loop

2

approximation the higher derivative regularization always gives the result which is in agreement
with other regularizations [57]. Nevertheless, the one-loop calculations can be used for demon-
strating the factorization of integrals which give the β-function into integrals of double total
derivatives. Moreover, they allow to verify the method of calculations and ﬁx some potential
problems. For example, the ﬁrst calculation of the quantum corrections made with the higher
covariant derivative regularization for the (non-supersymmetric) Yang–Mills theory [58] gave
the correct result for the one-loop β-function [59, 60] only after corrections made in [61, 62].
(One-loop quantum corrections in non-supersymmetric electrodynamics with the higher deriva-
tive term were also recently investigated in [63].) There are also other subtleties in calculating
quantum corrections in supersymmetric theories, see, e.g., [9, 64, 65]. One more important
reason for making the one-loop calculation is that for deriving the NSVZ relation by the direct
summation of supergraphs in all orders (such as in Refs. [34, 35]) this approximation should be
considered separately and the BRST invariant regularization is highly desirable.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Sect. 2 we regularize the N = 1 SYM theory by
higher covariant derivatives without breaking the BRST invariance and construct the generating
functional for the regularized theory. In Sect. 3 we calculate the one-loop divergences for various
Green functions. In particular, we demonstrate that all integrals giving the one-loop β-function
are integrals of double total derivatives in the momentum space independently of the form of
the higher derivative term, and ghost vertices with a single gauge line are ﬁnite.

tion for N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories

2.1 Action of the considered theory

In this paper we consider the general renormalizable N = 1 SYM theory. In the massless

limit this theory is described by the action

S =

which is written in terms of N = 1 superﬁelds [66, 67]. Here e0 and λijk
constant and the Yukawa couplings, respectively. The gauge superﬁeld

0 denote the bare coupling

V = e0V AT A

(4)

is hermitian, so that its components, V A, are real superﬁelds. φi are chiral matter superﬁelds
which lie in a certain representation R of the gauge group G. In general, this representation can
be reducible. The gauge superﬁeld strength

Wa ≡

1
8

¯D2(e−2V Dae2V ) = e0W A

a tA

(5)

is also a chiral superﬁeld. In order to obtain a gauge invariant theory, the Yukawa couplings
should satisfy the condition

λijm
0

(T A)m

k + λimk

0

(T A)m

j + λmjk

0

(T A)m

i = 0.

(6)

In this case the theory (3) is invariant under the transformations

3

φ → eAφ;

e2V → e−A+

e2V e−A,

(7)

where the parameter A is an arbitrary chiral superﬁeld. Under these transformations the gauge
superﬁeld strength is changed as

Wa → eAWae−A.

(8)

Note that in the last two equations we use the matrix notation. Explicitly writing the indexes
we obtain, e.g.,

It is also convenient to introduce the superﬁeld Ω which, by deﬁnition, satisﬁes the equation

φi → (eA)i

jφj,

etc.

(9)

e2V ≡ eΩ+

eΩ.

(10)

2.2 The background ﬁeld method

A convenient tool for calculating quantum corrections is the background ﬁeld method
[68, 69, 70], because it allows to obtain the explicitly gauge invariant eﬀective action. In the
supersymmetric case it is introduced by the substitution

eΩ → eΩeΩ,

so that

e2V → eΩ+

e2V eΩ.

Then the background gauge superﬁeld V is deﬁned by the equation

e2V = eΩ+

eΩ.

(11)

(12)

The theory which is obtained after the substitution (11) is evidently invariant under the back-
ground gauge transformations

eΩ → eiK eΩe−A;

eΩ → eΩe−iK;

V → eiK V e−iK ;

φ → eAφ,

(13)

where K is an arbitrary hermitian superﬁeld and A is a chiral superﬁeld which lies in the Lie
algebra of the gauge group.

Also the considered theory is invariant under the quantum gauge transformations

e2V → e−A+

e2V e−A;

eΩ → eΩ;

eΩ+

→ eΩ+

;

φ → e−ΩeAeΩφ.

(14)

The parameter A of the quantum gauge transformations is a background chiral superﬁeld which,
by deﬁnition, satisﬁes the condition

where the gauge and supersymmetric background covariant derivatives are deﬁned by

¯∇ ˙aA = 0,

∇a = e−Ω+

DaeΩ+

;

¯∇ ˙a = eΩ ¯D ˙ae−Ω.

(15)

(16)

Acting on a superﬁeld S which transforms as S → eiK S under the background gauge symmetry
(13) they will have the same transformation law, e.g., ∇aS → eiK ∇aS.

After the substitution (11) the superﬁeld strength Wa will have the form

Wa =

1
8

e−Ω ¯∇2(e−2V ∇ae2V )eΩ + Wa,

(17)

4

where we introduce the notation

Wa =

1
8

¯D2(e−2V Dae2V ).

(18)

It is convenient to ﬁx a gauge and introduce a regularization in such a way that the invariance
(13) remains unbroken. Then the eﬀective action will be also invariant under the transformations
(13), which is very convenient for calculating RG functions.

2.3 The higher covariant derivative regularization

The main idea of the higher covariant derivative regularization is adding a term with higher
degrees of the covariant derivatives (which we will denote by SΛ) to the classical action. Cer-
tainly, such a term is not uniquely deﬁned. There are a lot of options for choosing it. Here, for
deﬁniteness, we will use the following expression:

SΛ =

;

¯∇ ˙a = eΩeΩ ¯D ˙ae−Ωe−Ω.

(19)

(20)

The subscript Adj points out that they act on superﬁelds in the adjoint representation.
particular, this implies that

In

(cid:16)f0 + f1V + f2V 2 + . . .(cid:17)Adj

X ≡ f0X + f1[V, X] + f2[V, [V, X]] + . . .

(21)

The functions R(x) and F (x) satisfy the conditions R(0) = 1, F (0) = 1 and have polynomial
growth in the limit x → ∞.

One can verify that the expression (19) is invariant both under the background gauge trans-
formations (13) and under the quantum gauge transformations (14). Taking into account that

−

¯D2D2
16Λ2 φ =

∂2
Λ2 φ

(22)

for an arbitrary chiral superﬁeld φ, we see that in the lowest order in the (background and
quantum) gauge superﬁelds the regulators give R(∂2/Λ2) − 1 and F (∂2/Λ2) − 1. That is why
Eq. (19) is really a supersymmetric higher derivative term. After adding SΛ to the classical
action S we obtain the regularized action

It is convenient to choose the gauge ﬁxing term in the form

Sreg = S + SΛ.

because it does not break the background gauge invariance (13). Here the function K(x) by
construction satisﬁes the conditions K(0) = 1, K(∞) = ∞, and ξ0 is a constant. In this case
the standard gauge ﬁxing procedure leads to the following actions for the Faddeev–Popov and
Nielsen–Kallosh ghosts:

The ghost superﬁelds c = e0cAtA, ¯c = e0¯cAtA, b = e0bAtA are anticommuting and chiral. As
usual, the Nielsen–Kallosh ghosts interact only with the background gauge superﬁeld V and,
therefore, non-trivially contribute only in the one-loop approximation.

Introducing an auxiliary (commuting) chiral superﬁeld f it is also convenient to present the

gauge ﬁxing term in the form

Sgf =

(28)

which is obtained after the gauge ﬁxing procedure, is invariant under the background gauge
transformations (13), under which f and ghost superﬁelds should be transformed as

f → eAf e−A = (eA)Adjf ;

c → (eA)Adjc;

¯c → (eA)Adj ¯c;

b → (eA)Adjb.

(29)

However, it is evident that the action (28) is not invariant under the quantum gauge trans-
formation (14). Instead of this invariance the total action becomes invariant under the BRST
transformations

δ¯c = ε ¯D2(e−2V f +e2V );

δ¯c+ = εD2(e2V f e−2V );

δc = εc2;

δφ = εcφ;

δc+ = ε(c+)2;

δf = δf + = 0;

δb = δb+ = 0;

δΩ = δΩ+ = 0,

(30)

where ε 6= ε(x) is an anticommuting real scalar parameter. Two ﬁrst of these equations are
equivalent to the equations (14) in which the parameter A is given by the expression

A = εeΩce−Ω;

A+ = −εe−Ω+

c+eΩ+

.

(31)

This allows us to verify the nilpotency of the BRST transformations. Really, the equalities
δ1δ2c = 0 and δ1δ2¯c = 0 are evident, and

δ1δ2e2V = δ1(cid:16)ε2e−Ω+

c+eΩ+

e2V − e2V ε2eΩce−Ω(cid:17) = 0.

(32)

As a consequence, we obtain that δ1δ2V = 0 and see that the BRST transformations are nilpo-
tent. Writing the gauge ﬁxing term in the form (27) and using this property, one can easily
verify the BRST invariance of the action (28).

6

By introducing the higher derivative term one regularizes divergences beyond the one-loop
approximation [71]. In order to get rid of the remaining one-loop divergences, it is necessary to
insert the Pauli–Villars determinants into the generating functional [72]. Due to the absence of
quadratic divergences in supersymmetric theories it is possible to use the following Pauli–Villars
determinants:

Z[V , Sources] =Z DV Dφ Db D¯c Dc Det(P V, MΦ)Det(P V, Mϕ)−1

× exp(cid:16)iS + iSΛ + iSgf + iSFP + iSNK + iSsource(cid:17),

where

Det(P V, MΦ) =Z DΦ exp (iSΦ) ;

Det(P V, Mϕ)−1 =Z Dϕ exp (iSϕ) .

Here Φi is an anticommuting superﬁeld in the same representation as φi, three commuting
superﬁelds ϕf lie in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, and the actions for the
Pauli–Villars superﬁelds are given by

Below we will see that the chiral scalar superﬁelds ϕf introduced in this way exactly cancel the
one-loop (sub)divergences introduced by loops of the gauge superﬁeld and ghosts.

The actions (35) are also BRST invariant, because they are evidently invariant under the

quantum gauge transformations (14) if

Φ → e−ΩeAeΩΦ;

ϕf → e−ΩeAeΩϕf e−Ωe−AeΩ =(cid:0)e−ΩeAeΩ(cid:1)Adj ϕf .

For A given by Eq. (31) we obtain the BRST invariance.

Thus, the ﬁnal expression for the generating functional can be written as

Z[V , Sources] =Z Dµ exp(cid:16)iStotal + iSsource(cid:17),

where R Dµ denotes the integration measure which includes integration over all superﬁelds of

the theory, and the total action

Stotal = S + SΛ + Sgf + SFP + SNK + SΦ + Sϕ

(39)

is invariant under the above described BRST transformations. The generating functional for
the connected Green functions is given by

W [V , Sources] = −i ln Z[V , Sources],

(40)

and the eﬀective action Γ[V , Fields] is deﬁned in the standard way by using the Legendre
transformation.

2.4 Renormalization

It is well known [73, 74, 75, 76] that the considered supersymmetric theory is renormaliz-
able, so that the divergences can be absorbed into redeﬁnitions of the coupling constants and
(super)ﬁelds. Taking into account that the superpotential does not receive the divergent quan-
tum corrections according to the non-renormalization theorem [1] we can make the following
renormalization:

Zα

λijk = λmnp

0

(pZφ)m

j(pZφ)p

k;

b =pZbbR,

(41)

where α and λijk are the renormalized coupling constant and Yukawa couplings, respectively,
and the renormalized superﬁelds are denoted by the subscript R. We also take into account
that the background gauge superﬁeld is not renormalized due to the unbroken background
gauge symmetry (13). From the deﬁnitions (41) we see that Zc denotes the renormalization
constant for the Faddeev–Popov ghosts; ZV is the renormalization constant for the quantum
gauge superﬁeld, and Zα encodes the charge renormalization.

Because the Nielsen–Kallosh action is not renormalized, the renormalization constants satisfy
the relation ZαZb = 1. Similarly, taking into account that the two-point Green function of the
quantum gauge superﬁeld is transversal due to the Slavnov–Taylor identity [55, 56], we obtain
the relation ZξZ 2

V = 1.

The renormalization constants Zα and Zφ can be found by calculating the two-point Green
functions of the background gauge superﬁeld V and the matter superﬁelds, respectively. Due
to the background gauge invariance (13) the corresponding part of the eﬀective action can be
written in the form

coupling constant α(α0, λ0, Λ/µ) and the renormalization constant (Zφ)i
is a renormalization point, are deﬁned by requiring ﬁniteness of the expressions

constant Zα is obtained from the equation

In particular, the β-function is deﬁned in terms of the bare coupling constants according to the

3 The RG functions in the one-loop approximation

3.1 One-loop β-function

The two-point Green function of the background gauge superﬁeld in the one-loop approx-
imation is contributed by the diagrams presented in Fig. 1. In these diagrams external lines
correspond to the superﬁeld V . The wavy internal lines denote propagators of the quantum
gauge superﬁeld V ; the solid lines denote propagators of the matter superﬁelds φi and of the
Pauli–Villars superﬁelds Φi and ϕf ; the dashed lines denote propagators of the Faddeev–Popov
ghosts; the dotted lines denote propagators of the Nielsen–Kallosh ghosts.

Figure 1: One-loop diagrams which contribute to the two-point Green function of the background
superﬁeld.

After calculating these diagrams we have obtained the following result:

β(α0, λ0)

α2
0

= C2IV + T (R)Iφ + O(α0, λ2

0).

(51)

Here IV is the contribution of the quantum gauge superﬁeld, the (Faddeev–Popov and Nielsen–
Kallosh) ghosts, and the Pauli–Villars superﬁelds ϕf . Iφ denotes the contribution of the matter
superﬁeld φ and the corresponding Pauli–Villars superﬁeld Φ. We have veriﬁed that both these
integrals are integrals of double total derivatives independently of the concrete form of the
functions R and F and have the following form:

where MΦ is deﬁned by Eq.
(The ﬁrst term in the integral IV is the contribution of
diagrams with the loop of the quantum gauge superﬁeld V . The second term is a sum of diagrams
with the loop of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts and the loop of the Pauli–Villars superﬁelds ϕ2 and
ϕ3. The last term corresponds to diagrams with the loop of the Nielsen–Kallosh ghosts and the
Pauli–Villars superﬁeld ϕ1.)

We see that all these integrals are integrals of double total derivatives in the momentum
space. However, in general, they do not vanish, because of singularities of the integrands.
Really, let f (q2/Λ2) be a non-singular function with a rapid falloﬀ at inﬁnity. Then we consider
the integral of the double total derivative

This integral can be easily reduced to the integral of the δ-function singularity:

(55)

Using this result we calculate the integrals IV and Iφ. For example, let us consider the integral
Iφ. First, we make the diﬀerentiation with respect to ln Λ taking into account that MΦ is
proportional to Λ and, then, use Eq. (55):

[77].

3.2 One-loop anomalous dimension of the matter superﬁelds

The one-loop anomalous dimension of the superﬁelds φi for the considered theory is deter-
mined by the diagrams presented in Fig. 2. They give the following result for the anomalous
dimension deﬁned in terms of the bare coupling constant:

Due to the derivative with respect to ln Λ (which should be taken at ﬁxed values of the renor-

Taking into account that

Note that in the last equation the result is written in terms of the bare coupling constants α0
and λijk
0 , because we calculate the anomalous dimension deﬁned in terms of the bare charges.
Certainly, the expression (63) coincides with the well-known result. However, it is interesting
to compare the integral (60) with the integrals which give the two-loop β-function with the
considered regularization, as it was done in, e.g., [40].

3.3 One-loop renormalization of the quantum gauge superﬁeld

From the two-point Green function of the quantum gauge superﬁeld we can ﬁnd the constant
Z 2
V . In the one-loop approximation this Green function is contributed by the diagrams presented
in Fig. 3. After calculating them in the limit of the vanishing external momentum we obtained

3.4 One-loop renormalization of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts

In order to ﬁnd the anomalous dimension of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts (deﬁned in terms of
the bare coupling constant) it is necessary to calculate the diagrams presented in Fig. 4. It is
convenient to write the result in the form

Figure 4: Diagrams contributing to the one-loop anomalous dimension of the Faddeev–Popov
ghosts.

(68)

This implies that in the general gauge the two-point Green function of the Faddeev–Popov
ghosts is divergent, and the higher covariant derivative regularization does regularize these

13

divergences. However, comparing Eq. (68) with Eq. (65) (or Eq. (67)) we see that in the
one-loop approximation

d

d ln Λ(cid:16) ln Zc + ln ZV −

(69)

2

ln Zα(cid:17) = 0.

As a consequence, the vertices of the type ¯c V c are ﬁnite. Possibly, this statement is valid in
all loops if the regularization does not break the BRST invariance of the theory. Note that for
some particular regularizations and gauge ﬁxing conditions validity of Eq. (69) in the one-loop
[54] for the pure N = 1 SYM theory
approximation can also be seen from the results of Ref.
and of Ref. [32, 33] for the general N = 2 SYM theory with matter.

4 Conclusion

In this paper we consider a general N = 1 SYM theory with matter regularized by a very
general version of the higher derivative regularization which does not break the BRST invariance
and calculate all RG functions in the one-loop approximation. The considered version of the
higher derivative regularization was not earlier used to obtain quantum corrections, because it
leads to very complicated calculations. However, it does not break symmetries of the theory
and seems to be very useful for the general derivation of the NSVZ β-function in the non-
Abelian case by the direct summation of supergraphs. Making such a derivation one should
consider the one-loop approximation separately, and this problem is addressed in this paper.
In particular, we have demonstrated that all one-loop momentum integrals for the β-function
are integrals of double total derivatives independently of the form of the higher derivative term.
This seems to be a general feature of all supersymmetric theories.1 Certainly, the result of
the calculation coincided with the well-known expression for the one-loop β-function in the
supersymmetric case. Also we have obtained the momentum integrals deﬁning the one-loop
anomalous dimension, which also coincided with the well-known expression. In prospect, these
integrals can be compared with integrals giving the two-loop β-function, which are related to
them due to the existence of the NSVZ β-function. Also we obtained that the vertices ¯c V c,
¯c V c+, ¯c+V c, and ¯c+V c+ (containing two lines of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts and a single line of
the quantum gauge superﬁeld) are not renormalized in the considered approximation. Possibly,
this feature is valid in an arbitrary order of the perturbation theory.
