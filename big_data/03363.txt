We investigate the thermal and electronic collective ﬂuctuations that contribute to the ﬁnite-
temperature adsorption properties of ﬂexible adsorbates on surfaces on the example of the molecular
switch azobenzene C12H10N2 on the Ag(111) surface. Using ﬁrst-principles molecular dynamics sim-
ulations we obtain the free energy of adsorption that accurately accounts for entropic contributions,
whereas the inclusion of many-body dispersion interactions accounts for the electronic correlations
that govern the adsorbate binding. We ﬁnd the adsorbate properties to be strongly entropy-driven,
as can be judged by a kinetic molecular desorption prefactor of 1024 s−1 that largely exceeds previ-
ously reported estimates. We relate this eﬀect to sizable ﬂuctuations across structural and electronic
observables. Comparison of our calculations to temperature-programmed desorption measurements
demonstrates that ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects play a dominant role for ﬂexible molecules in contact
with polarizable surfaces, and that recently developed ﬁrst-principles methods oﬀer an optimal tool
to reveal novel collective behavior in such complex systems.

Complex molecules adsorbed at inorganic surfaces
spark interest as basic building blocks in surface nan-
otechnology and energy materials [1], but also in the
context of biocompatibility of biomolecule-metal inter-
faces and the structure of solid-liquid interfaces [2]. Con-
siderable eﬀort goes into characterizing the structure,
stability, and dynamics of these systems [3].
In fact,
with recent advances in experimental characterization
techniques [4] and ab-initio methods based on density-
functional theory (DFT) [5], several systems have been
well characterized at idealized conditions, i.e. low tem-
perature and ultrahigh vacuum. These include planar
aromatic molecules, such as benzene [6] and 3,4,9,10-
perylene-tetracarboxylic acid (PTCDA) [7–10] adsorbed
on the Ag(111) surface. Both examples represent com-
parably rigid molecules forming well-ordered overlayer
structures.

In contrast, more complex adsorbed systems such as
large polymer chains or biological molecules will be nei-
ther well-ordered nor rigid. Their ﬂexibility arises from
internal torsions and rovibrational coupling in combina-
tion with long-range correlations and entails dynamics
and reactivity that might be largely shaped by non-trivial
thermal and electronic ﬂuctuations. Whereas the role
of thermal ﬂuctuations and corresponding entropic con-
tributions has always been at the forefront in the mod-
eling of soft condensed matter, their relevance in gas-
surface dynamics of ﬂexible molecules in contact with
inorganic surfaces is less clear. Long-range correlations
induced by electronic ﬂuctuations are an additional com-
plication in the combined molecule/surface system. Sev-

eral recent works have emphasized the role of tempera-
ture for dynamics of benzene on stepped surfaces [12],
conformational switching of porphyrine derivatives on
Cu(111) [13, 14] and also for thermal desorption of large
alkane chains from graphite [15] and metal surfaces [16–
19]. Nevertheless, the prevalent view in surface science is
that 0 K calculations in the harmonic approximation are
often suﬃcient to reproduce the structure and stability

of adsorbed molecules.

To elucidate the possible role of ﬂuctuations, both
thermal and induced by electronic correlations, we have
chosen to study azobenzene in its planar form (AB) ad-
sorbed on the Ag(111) surface – a widely used model for
on-surface molecular switches (Fig. 1a and b) [20, 21].
Azobenzene is a challenging, but also ideal benchmark
system containing all relevant features of realistic ad-
sorbates: potential ﬂexibility, low-frequency vibrational
modes, and both covalent and dispersion-dominated
binding motifs [22]. Several averaged observables for
azobenzene on Ag(111) have been studied experimen-
tally [22–24] and theoretically [20, 21, 25–27]. The 0 K
adsorption energies as predicted by several diﬀerent DFT
approximations range from 0.11 to 2.20 eV (Fig. 1c).
A combination of GGA-PBE [28] and the recent many-
body dispersion [29, 30] (MBD) method yield the clos-
est agreement with the most recent experimental ref-
erence of 1.02±0.06 eV, determined from temperature-
programmed desorption (TPD) measurements using the
arguably most reliable complete analysis approach [31]
based on the Polanyi-Wigner equation [23]. Assuming
validity of the experimental analysis, a remaining theo-
retical/experimental discrepancy to PBE+MBD in ad-
sorption energy of 20% comes as a surprise, considering
the recent quantitative success of this level of theory on
the above mentioned examples of benzene and PTCDA
on Ag(111) [6, 10].

To assess the role of thermal ﬂuctuations and their
eﬀect on the adsorbate stability, we perform explicit ab-
initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of the free
energy of adsorption ∆F for AB on Ag(111) at the ex-
perimental desorption temperature of 400 K [23]. Hereby
thermodynamic integration (blue moon sampling) along
a chosen reaction coordinate λ is performed using con-
strained AIMD sampling at discrete points along the des-
orption path:

The reaction coordinate λ in eq.
1 has been chosen
as the average vertical surface-distance of the two cen-
tral nitrogen atoms in the AB molecule (cf. Fig. 2a)
ranging from 2.4 to 14 ˚A. During AIMD at constant
temperature the vertical height of the center of these
two atoms has been constrained, whereas all other de-
grees of freedom were allowed to ﬂuctuate freely in verti-
cal and lateral directions. Simulations have been per-
formed using dispersion-inclusive DFT in form of the
PBE+vdWsurf functional [9, 28] as implemented in the
CASTEP code [32] (see SI for more details [33]). In com-
paring the diﬀerences between the resulting adsorption
energy ∆U (blue circles in Fig. 2b) and the free en-
ergy of adsorption ∆F (blue circles in Fig. 2d) we ﬁnd
a large entropic contribution that reshapes the free en-

2

ergy proﬁle along the reaction coordinate. We calculate
ﬁnite temperature expectation values by averaging ob-
servables along the trajectories and weighting them with
the probability distribution as given by the Boltzmann
weight of the free energy (blue curve in cf. Fig. 2c). The
result is an increased adsorption height of 2.89 ˚A and
a reduced adsorption energy of 1.58 eV when compared
to the 0 K results (2.78 ˚A and 1.68 eV), both in better
agreement with x-ray standing wave [21] and tempera-
ture programmed desorption experiments [23] (cf. Table
I).

From the diﬀerence in adsorption energy ∆U and
free energy ∆F we extract an entropy of desorption of
0.24 eV per 100 K, which represents the driving force
for this change. Using the Arrhenius equation in the
context of transition-state theory we can translate this
entropy contribution into a preexponential factor ν =
(kBT /h) · exp(∆S/kB) [34] for desorption of 1024 s−1.
This exceeds some of the highest ever reported desorption
prefactors ranging up to 1020 s−1 in the case of desorption
of alkane chains [15, 17, 35]. In contrast, a corresponding
desorption entropy estimate as given by a simple rigid-
rotor harmonic oscillator partition function instead only
amounts to 0.12 eV per 100 K, owing to the inability of
0 K calculations to describe the eﬀects of anharmonicity
and mode coupling.

Our PBE+vdWsurf AIMD approach correctly captures
thermal eﬀects and the sizable entropic contributions
originating from averaging over an increasingly larger do-
main of phase space as the molecule desorbs from the
surface. However, at the same time the average ad-
sorption energy of 1.58 eV still exceeds the experimen-
tal reference by more than 50%. This can be traced
back to the simple eﬀective account of long-range elec-
tronic correlations between molecule and substrate at
the PBE+vdWsurf level [9, 21, 36]. Across all distances
the combined molecule-surface system is governed by siz-
able classical and quantum-dynamic ﬂuctuations in the
electronic structure. The ﬁrst are captured in electron
density ﬂuctuations throughout the PBE+vdWsurf dy-
namics. The latter arise from dynamically ﬂuctuating
polarizability changes that screen the molecule-surface
interaction for a given geometry and are only partly cap-
tured at the pairwise-additive vdWsurf level of theory.

The PBE+MBD (many-body

ap-
proach [29, 30, 37] as implemented in the FHI-AIMS
code [38] has recently been shown to accurately cap-
ture such long-range correlations and dynamic charge
rearrangements for a wide range of extended systems
and nanostructures [6, 10, 37, 39–41]. MBD goes
well beyond pairwise-additive dispersion schemes by
including higher-order many-body contributions and a
non-additive geometry-dependence of the polarization
response [10]. This approach yields an adsorption energy
of 1.24 eV for AB on Ag(111) at 0 K. Assuming a
large overlap between the phase space sampling that

where β = 1/kbT . The resulting MBD-corrected po-
tential energy (red triangles in Fig. 2b) and free en-
ergy curves (red triangles in Fig. 2d) are shifted closer
to zero with a remaining free energy desorption bar-
rier of only 0.20 eV. This correctly reﬂects the onset
of desorption at this temperature, which is also evi-
dent from the 400 K probability distribution function
P (λ) = exp(−∆F (λ)/kbT ) along the reaction coordinate
(see red curve in Fig. 2c). The probability of ﬁnding AB
at a given adsorption height is signiﬁcant over a wide
range from 2.6 up to 5 ˚A distance from the surface. This
can be seen as a result of the temperature-dependent
trade-oﬀ between adsorption energy and entropy. The
increased probability at larger distances originates from
a sudden increase in molecular freedom leading to a wide
and shallow basin in the PBE+MBD free energy. The
latter will become clearer upon discussion of the geomet-
rical details of the desorption process.

With the incorporation of long-range electronic cor-
relations at the PBE+MBD level our AIMD simula-
tions are eﬀectively en par with experimental observa-
tions. The average PBE+MBD adsorption height at
210 K, which we can estimate from ∆U (λ) and ∆S(λ),
2.85±0.15 ˚A is in good agreement with our previous cal-
culation of 2.98 ˚A and results from x-ray standing wave
measurements at 210 K [21]. The increased average
ﬁnite-temperature adsorption height, in turn, yields an
adsorption energy at 400 K of 0.99±0.17 eV (see Table
I) that is in remarkable agreement with the adsorption
energy as extracted from TPD measurements [23].

We can conclude at this stage that a reliable descrip-
tion of the desorption process requires the interplay of
an accurate ab-initio electronic structure description and

rings with respect to the surface (angles α1 and α2) as
a function of distance λ. Close to the equilibrium dis-
tance of 3 ˚A the molecule is almost planar (ω ≈180◦ and
α1(2) ≈0◦). At intermediate distances between 3 and 7 ˚A
molecular rotations and translations become increasingly
accessible and geometric parameters ﬂuctuate wildly as
the molecule samples the available conformations. As a
consequence of an eﬃcient coupling between vibrational
and rotational degrees of freedom, starting at a distance
of 4 ˚A, molecular ﬂapping motion of AB (see inset of
Fig. 3a) induces twisting, bending, and subsequently
molecular rotations, which turn into free molecular mo-
tion beyond 7 ˚A distance from the surface. The sudden
increase in conﬁgurational freedom becomes apparent in
the broad probability distribution (see Fig. 2c). As a
result, all measurable expectation values will be averages
over a wide range of surface distances and conﬁgurations
and subject to equally large ﬂuctuations – an observation
that may be accessible in future experiments from time-
resolved single molecule studies or detailed experimental
error analysis.

These geometrical ﬂuctuations directly translate to
ﬂuctuations in observables derived from the electron den-
sity such as the charge transfer between molecule and
surface ∆q and the molecular dipole moment perpen-
dicular to the surface µz (see Table I and Fig. S1 in
the Supplemental Material). Strong ﬂuctuations in the
adsorption height of the molecule shift molecular reso-
nances with respect to the Fermi level, which in turn
control the charge-transfer between molecule and sur-
face. The relevance of an accurate treatment of polariza-
tion eﬀects is visible in the Cartesian components of the
static molecular polarizability as a function of molecule-
surface distance (Fig. 3c). Polarizability components
change anisotropically over several orders of magnitude
across the reaction coordinate. The individual variances
shown as error bars in Fig. 3c do not seem large, how-
ever relative to the absolute polarizability of the gas-
phase molecule they amount to ﬂuctuations of up to 7%.
The above polarizability changes may serve as a sensitive
probe of electronic ﬂuctuations that appear as homo-
geneous temperature-dependent broadenings in single-
molecule surface-enhanced Raman experiments [44–46].
In summary, we have presented full ab-initio molec-
ular dynamics simulations of the desorption of azoben-
zene from a Ag(111) surface close to room temperature.
For this system, a correct description of adsorption en-
ergy and entropy could only be achieved by explicitly
accounting for ﬁnite-temperature ﬂuctuations and long-
range electronic correlations. Whereas the ﬁrst activate
and couple anharmonic modes, the latter screen the dis-
persion interactions between adsorbate and substrate at
all distances. Only recently has it been stated that ad-
sorption entropies have been systematically underesti-
mated in the past [16, 35] and that processes on sur-
faces can be purely driven by entropy [13, 14]. The here

the explicit inclusion of the real-time dynamics of the pro-
cess yielding the right change in energy and entropy. To
further reiterate the importance of the interplay between
energy and entropy we can deﬁne an estimate for the des-
orption temperature as the ratio between adsorption en-
ergy and entropy: Tdes = ∆U/∆S. As the corresponding
PBE+MBD desorption temperature we ﬁnd 495±99 K.
A description of the energetics or ﬁnite temperature ef-
fects at a lower level destroys the fair agreement with ex-
periment. For example neglecting many-body dispersion
contributions at the level of pairwise dispersion (vdWsurf )
overestimates the adsorption energy by more than 50%
resulting in desorption temperatures beyond 600 K. Ne-
glecting the real-time dynamics and applying the har-
monic approximation results in an underestimation of the
adsorption entropy and desorption temperatures beyond
1000 K.

The intricate interplay of both thermal and electronic
ﬂuctuations becomes evident from a more detailed anal-
ysis of observables such as the molecular geometry along
the reaction coordinate [43]. Fig. 3a shows the cen-
tral dihedral angle ω and the orientation of the phenyl

calculated desorption entropy of azobenzene on Ag(111)
appears to be among the highest ever reported [15, 17].
The resulting strong temperature dependence of the ver-
tical adsorption height and other molecular and elec-
tronic observables for a comparably small molecule such
as azobenzene suggests that ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects be-
yond the harmonic regime are relevant for all but the
most rigid adsorbates. In order to approach more real-
istic model systems in the future and to move toward
ambient conditions more research is necessary focusing
on the nature and extent of ﬁnite-temperature eﬀects,
potentially also targeting the time-resolved analysis of
single molecule adsorption events.
