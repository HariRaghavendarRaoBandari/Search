Abstract

We investigate the monogamy of holographic n-partite information for a system consisting of n

disjoint parallel strips in AdS and AdS black brane geometries. More precisely, we study the sign

of this quantity, e.g. for n = 4, 5, in various dimensions and for diﬀerent parameters. Our results

show that for quantum ﬁeld theories with holographic duals, the holographic 4-partite information is

always positive and the sign of holographic 5-partite information is found to be negative in the dual

strongly coupled 1 + 1 dimensional CFT. This latter result indicates that the holographic 4-partite

information is monogamous. We also ﬁnd the critical points corresponding to the possible phase

transitions of these quantities.

Introduction

Entanglement entropy is one of the important non-local quantities which measures the quantum entan-

glement between diﬀerent degrees of freedom of a quantum mechanical system [1, 2]. Similar to other

non-local quantities, e.g. Wilson loop and correlation functions, entanglement entropy can be used to

classify the various quantum phase transitions and critical points [3]. In the context of quantum ﬁeld

theory there is a straightforward instruction to deﬁne this quantity (for example, see [4, 5]). Consider a

constant time slice in a d dimensional quantum ﬁeld theory and divide it into two spatial regions A and
¯A where they are complement to each other. For a local quantum ﬁeld theory this geometrical division
leads to a speciﬁc partitioning of the corresponding total Hilbert space as H = HA ⊗ H ¯A. Now the
reduced density matrix for region A can be computed by integrating out the degrees of freedom that live
in ¯A, i.e. ρA = Tr ¯A ρ where ρ is the total density matrix. The entanglement entropy is given by the
Von Neumann entropy for this reduced density matrix, i.e. SA = −TrA ρA log ρA.

Entanglement entropy for local quantum ﬁeld theories is inﬁnite such that for d > 2 the coeﬃcient

of the divergent term is proportional to the area of the entangling surface [6, 7]

SEE ∝ AA

d−2 + ··· ,

(1.1)

where  is the UV cut-oﬀ. This behavior is the celebrated area law which is due to the inﬁnite cor-

relations between degrees of freedom near the boundary of entangling surface. Beside the elegant role

of entanglement entropy in various physical contexts, e.g. quantum information theory and black hole

physics, it has some features which are less pleasant. Appearance of the UV cut-oﬀ in the expression of

entanglement entropy makes it a non-universal quantity. Also, this quantity for a single entangling region

cannot demonstrate all the physical content of a ﬁeld theory, for example in a two dimensional conformal

ﬁeld theory (CFT) entanglement entropy for a single interval only depends on the central charge of the

theory and other aspects of CFT are absent [8]. According to these features, it seems natural to search

for other useful quantities to improve our knowledge of the Hilbert space of a quantum system.

In the context of quantum information theory many quantities were deﬁned to overcome the shortcom-

ings that we encountered using entanglement entropy, e.g. mutual and tripartite information. Mutual

information for a system which has two disjoint parts is given by [9]

I [2](≡ I)(A : B) = S(A) + S(B) − S(A ∪ B),

(1.2)

where S(A ∪ B) is the entanglement entropy for the union of the two entangling regions. This is a
ﬁnite quantity and quantiﬁes the amount of entanglement (information) which is shared between two

subsystems. In [10,11] it was shown that mutual information in a two dimensional CFT depends explicitly

on the full operator content of the theory and not only the central charge. Another interesting feature of

the mutual information is its positivity which is due to the strong subadditivity property for entanglement

entropy.

In addition to the entanglement entropy and mutual information, another useful quantity which is

deﬁned for a system consisting of three disjoint parts is tripartite information. This quantity is deﬁned

as follows [9]

I [3](A : B : C) = S(A) + S(B) + S(C) − S(A ∪ B) − S(A ∪ C)

− S(B ∪ C) + S(A ∪ B ∪ C),

(1.3)

where S(A∪B∪C) is the entanglement entropy for the union of three subsystems. Tripartite information
is free of divergences and can be positive, negative or zero depending on the underlying ﬁeld theory. It is

important to mention that in spite of mutual information, tripartite information is ﬁnite even when the

regions share boundaries. Also, in [12] it was shown that it is related to the topological entanglement

2

entropy. According to the deﬁnition given by (1.3), the tripartite information can be written in terms of

mutual information as follows

I [3](A : B : C) = I(A : B) + I(A : C) − I(A : B ∪ C).

(1.4)

Indeed as we explain below in the context of ﬁeld theories with gravitational dual it was shown that the
holographic tripartite information is always negative, i.e. I [3](A : B : C) < 0, which implies that the
holographic mutual information is monogamous.1

Intuitively, by generalizing the previous instruction to a system consisting of n partitions, one can

deﬁne a new quantity which is called n-partite information. Similar to mutual and tripartite information,

the n-partite information is given by [13]

I [n](A1 : ··· : An) =

S(Ai ∪ Aj) + ··· − (−1)nS(A1 ∪ ··· ∪ An),

(1.5)

S(Ai) − n(cid:88)

i=1

i<j

n(cid:88)

I(A1 : Ai) − n(cid:88)

n(cid:88)

where in terms of the mutual information, the n-partite information may be written as follows

I [n](A1 : ··· : An) =

I(A1 : Ai ∪ Aj) +

I(A1 : Ai ∪ Aj ∪ Ak) − ···

i=2

i=2<j

i=2<j<k

+ (−1)nI(A1 : A2 ∪ A2 ··· ∪ An).

(1.6)

This speciﬁc combination of the entanglement entropies between diﬀerent subsystems leads to a ﬁnite

quantity. Moreover, this deﬁnition is such that for n = 1, n = 2 and n = 3 reduces to entanglement

entropy, mutual information and tripartite information respectively. Other quantities can be extracted

for higher values of n, e.g. 4-partite and 5-partite information for n = 4 and n = 5. Similar to mutual

and tripartite information, these quantities may help us to investigate the operator content of the theory.
According to equation (1.5), one can ﬁnd a simple relation between the n-partite and (n − 1)-partite
information as follows

I [n](A{i}) = I [n−1](A{1,··· ,n−2} : An−1) + I [n−1](A{1,··· ,n−2} : An) − I [n−1](A{1,··· ,n−2} : An−1 ∪ An).
(1.7)
The above relation shows that the sign of n-partite information constraints the monogamy of (n − 1)-
partite information such that for any n when I [n] < 0 the I [n−1] becomes monogamous.

Although the previously mentioned quantities have interesting features which are useful to explore

the Hilbert space of a quantum ﬁeld theory, computing these quantities is not an easy task. Speciﬁcally,

analytic computation of entanglement entropy is only done in few cases, e.g. a two dimensional conformal

ﬁeld theory. In [14] the authors proposed that by virtue of the AdS/CFT correspondence [15–17] one

can address this diﬃculty. According to this correspondence, a strongly coupled CFT with large number

of degrees of freedom is dual to a classical gravity on an asymptotically AdS background. Using the dual

gravity description, the prescription for ﬁnding the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) associated

to a spatial region has a simple geometric meaning. Consider a d dimensional CFT which lives on the
boundary of an AdSd+1 space-time. Then the entanglement entropy for a spatial region A is given by
the following expression

SEE =

(1.8)

where GN is the Newton’s constant in (d + 1) bulk dimensions and Amin(γA) is the minimal area of a

co-dimension two hypersurface γA in the bulk such that on the boundary of space-time ∂γA = ∂A. This
prescription has passed several basic checks (see [18] for a review). Generalization of this proposal to

time dependent geometries and studying the thermalization process have also been done in [19–27].

Using Ryu and Takayanagi (RT) proposal one can also ﬁnd the HEE for the union of disjoint entan-

gling regions [28–32]. Particularly, in [29] it was shown that the holographic mutual information (HMI)

undergoes a ﬁrst order phase transition by changing the distance between two regions. This phase transi-
tion is due to the competition between two diﬀerent RT surfaces for computing S(A∪ B). It is important
to mention that the resultant HMI is a positive quantity as expected. Also, generalizing this procedure

to systems consisting of more subsystems is straightforward. In this context, holographic tripartite and

n-partite information in static and time dependent geometries have been studied in [13, 33–37] which

show some interesting features. Actually, holographic tripartite information is always non-positive which

leads to the monogamy of HMI [13]. Also, in [35] it was shown that in a speciﬁc limit, the holographic

n-partite information has a deﬁnite sign, i.e. it is positive (negative) for even (odd) n. This is in contrast

to the ﬁeld theory results where the sign of these quantities is not ﬁxed and depends on the underlying

QFT. It is believed that these behaviors are a reminiscent of ﬁeld theories which have gravitational dual

and also may help us to more investigate the gravity side. Indeed, there is a strong connection between

the energy constraints in the bulk and the sign of these quantities in the dual CFT. As an explicit exam-

ple, in [34] it was shown that relaxing the null energy condition on the gravity side makes the holographic

tripartite information positive and hence the monogamy of HMI breaks down.

The main aim of this paper is to investigate the behavior of holographic n-partite information, e.g.

n = 4 and n = 5 in diﬀerent gravity set-ups. This study helps us to further investigate the monogamy

of tripartite and 4-partite information. As we mentioned, the analysis of [35] is only valid for a speciﬁc

limit where all of the entangling regions length (cid:96) and the separation between them h are equal and also
h (cid:28) (cid:96). The authors have shown that assuming these conditions simpliﬁes the expression for holographic
n-partite information signiﬁcantly and its sign becomes ﬁxed. In the following sections, we will relax the
h (cid:28) (cid:96) condition and study the behavior of holographic n-partite information.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we will investigate the holographic n-partite

information, speciﬁcally four and ﬁve partite information will be considered. In section three, we will

study those quantities in AdS black brane (AdS-BH) background. Section four is devoted to conclusions

and discussions. In the appendix, within a brief review, we will recall holographic entanglement entropy

for a strip.

2 Holographic n-partite information in AdS geometry

For an entangling region, the entanglement entropy contains a short-distance divergence which is pro-

portional to its area in the boundary. This makes the entanglement entropy to be scheme-dependent.

However, for two disjoint systems one can introduce the mutual information as (1.2) which is a ﬁnite and

scheme-independent quantity. From the subadditivity property of entanglement entropy, it is proved
that the mutual information is always non-negative quantity, I(A : B) ≥ 0. On the other hand, for
three disjoint regions say as A, B and C, one can deal with tripartite information which is deﬁned by
(1.3) and in terms of the mutual information it is given by (1.4).2 In [13] it is shown that for quantum
ﬁeld theories with holographic duals, the HMI is monogamous due to I [3](A : B : C) ≤ 0. For n strips
with the same width (cid:96) separated by distance h, in the speciﬁc limit where h (cid:28) (cid:96), in [35] this property
has been extended for the holographic n-partite information, namely the n-partite information which is

deﬁned by (1.7) has a deﬁnite sign: it is positive (negative) for even (odd) n. In this section by relaxing

the proposed limit for (cid:96) and h, we verify this property for mutual and tripartite information in AdS

background and then we generalize the results to four and ﬁve partite information. To ﬁx the notation,

2 In the context of classical information theory, the tripartite information which is used as a measure of entanglement

is also called the I-measure [38].

It is noted that the strip entangling regions are considered to be symmetric meaning that they have the

In the rest of this section we study the holographic n-partite information in AdS. Note that in all of the
following numeric computations, we assume that ρH = 1, L = 1 and 1/4GN = 1, for simplicity.

2.1 Holographic mutual and tripartite information

Holographic mutual and tripartite information can be written in terms of holographic entanglement

entropies which are given by equations (1.2) and (1.3).

In the context of holographic CFTs, it was

pointed out mutual information undergoes a ﬁrst order phase transition due to a discontinuity in its ﬁrst

derivative [29]. In fact for a given two subsystems A and B, when they are close to each other there is
a ﬁnite correlation between them which means I(A : B) (cid:54)= 0, however, as the separation between them
is increased, the mutual correlation vanishes. In fact when I(A : B) = 0, the two sub-systems become

completely decoupled, this is actually called disentangling transition [39]. It is claimed that this phase

transition is related to the large central charge limit of the CFT and by considering quantum corrections

it would disappear [32]. There is a simple gravity picture for this phase transition depending on a jump

between two diﬀerent conﬁguration candidates for the minimal surface of the entanglement entropy of
the union region S(A∪B). Actually in our case for two strips, in the bulk there are always two candidates
for minimal surfaces which are schematically shown in Fig.1 and depending on the separation between
A and B, one should use one of them in computing S(A ∪ B).4 Therefore depending on the ratio of h
(cid:96) ,
one obtains

S(A ∪ B) =

S (h) + S (2(cid:96) + h) (≡ A2)
2S ((cid:96)) (≡ A1)

for h
for h

(cid:96) is smaller than the critical ratio,
(cid:96) is larger than the critical ratio,

(2.4)

(cid:40)

3In this paper we set the AdS radius to one.
4Note that there are other possibilities where the two minimal area surfaces cross each other, but one can show that

such cross surfaces have indeed a larger area than those depicted in Fig.1.

from which the minimum one is used in computing HMI. The critical ratio, r1, at which the minimum
conﬁguration is transitioned from A2 to A1 can be obtained by equating A1 with A2, it is in fact a
number that depends on the dimension of CFT. In AdS3 and AdS4, we have listed this speciﬁc value in
Table.1. Consequently, for two disjoint entangling regions, the holographic mutual information becomes

(cid:40)

I (h, (cid:96)) =

2S ((cid:96)) − S (h) − S (h + 2(cid:96)),
0,

0 < h
(cid:96) < r1,
r1 ≤ h
(cid:96) .

(2.5)

It can be shown that HMI is positive in ranges smaller than the critical value (denoted by ri) and reaches
zero in greater ranges; this is illustrated in Fig.2.

Figure 2: Holographic mutual information in AdS3 (left) and AdS4 (right) backgrounds for (cid:96) = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
from left to right.

About tripartite information more than two conﬁgurations are possible.

In fact, for n entangling
regions with no presumptions, the overall number of conﬁgurations is (2n − 1)!!; however, since the strip
regions are assumed to be symmetric, some of the conﬁgurations would have equivalent areas so the

number of possible conﬁgurations will be reduced and the rest can be obtained by rearranging these

ones [34, 35]. For n = 3, there are seven independent conﬁgurations, but one can show that only four

diﬀerent conﬁgurations, which are schematically shown in Fig.3, are competing in selecting the minimum

area. In the present case, one obtains two critical values for the ratio of h/(cid:96) in which the minimal area

turns from one to another conﬁguration. Precisely depending on the separation between entangling
regions, there are a competition between A1 and A2 and also between A3 and A4. In Table.1, we have
listed these critical ratios in AdS3 and AdS4.

Consequently, we have found the holographic tripartite information as follows

 S ((cid:96)) − 2S (h + 2(cid:96)) + S (2h + 3(cid:96)),

2S (h) − 3S ((cid:96)) + S (2h + 3(cid:96)),

(2.7)

For diﬀerent values of (cid:96), Fig.4 indicates that the tripartite information is always negative

I [3](A : B : C) ≤ 0.

This numeric result shows that according to the RT formula, the holographic tripartite information is

always extensive which is in accordance with [13].

Figure 4: Holographic tripartite information in AdS3 (left) and AdS4 (right) backgrounds for (cid:96) =
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 from left to right.

2.2 Holographic 4-partite information

In this subsection we consider the holographic 4-partite information in AdS background. To do so, we

follow the same approach of previous subsection and hence the ﬁrst step would be considering all of the

possible conﬁgurations for the unions of entangling regions. In fact, for four strips A, B, C and D as the

entangling regions with the same width (cid:96) separated by a distance h, the four partite information is given

by

I [4](h, (cid:96)) = 4S(A) − 3S(A ∪ B) − 2S(A ∪ C) − S(A ∪ D) + 2S(A ∪ B ∪ C) + 2S(A ∪ B ∪ C)

− S(A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D).

(2.8)

For this case there are 19 independent conﬁgurations [35] from which choosing those that produce

minimum area is the next and most important stage. In the bulk for computing the related HEE, there

are seven candidates for minimal surfaces which are schematically shown in Fig.5.

In the computation of related minimal surfaces, one ﬁnds three critical values in AdS3 and AdS4
backgrounds which are listed in Table.2. The ﬁrst one is caused by transitions from A4 to A3 and also

surface in each case and after making use of (1.5), one obtains the 4-partite information in the resultant

intervals as follows

I [4] (h, (cid:96)) =

(2.9)

Now the main aim is to study the 4-partite information. Fig.6 shows the numeric computation of 4-partite
information for some ﬁxed values of (cid:96) in AdS3 and AdS4 backgrounds which indicates that holographic
4-partite information is always positive.

2.3 Holographic 5-partite information

The holographic 5-partite information can indeed be deﬁned by setting n = 5 in (1.5) and one can show

that there are actually 50 independent conﬁgurations, however, among them only 11 conﬁgurations play

One can show that in AdS3 background, there are in fact four critical points which are resulted from the
transitions between diﬀerent pairs of conﬁgurations as listed below:

• r1: A8 to A6, A4 to A3 and A2 to A1,
• r2: A7 to A6 and A5 to A3,
• r3: A9 to A6,
• r4: A11 to A10,

the critical points are summarized in Table.3. Consequently, one can show that depending on the ratio
of h

(cid:96) , the holographic 5-partite information in AdS3 background becomes



I [5] (h, (cid:96)) =

S (2h + 3(cid:96)) − 2S (3h + 4(cid:96)) + S (4h + 5(cid:96)) ,
3S ((cid:96)) − 2S (h) − 2S (3h + 4(cid:96)) + S (4h + 5(cid:96)) ,

(2.10)

For some values of (cid:96), Fig.8 shows that holographic 5-partite information is always negative in AdS3,
namely

I [5](A : B : C : D : E) ≤ 0.

Making use of the above relation and (1.7), one can write

I [4](A : B : C : D ∪ E) ≥ I [4](A : B : C : D) + I [4](A : B : C : E),

(2.11)

which indicates that holographic 4-partite information among ﬁve disjoint spatial regions A, B, C, D

and E satisﬁes the inequality like monogamy relation.

3 Holographic n-partite information in AdS-BH geometry

In this section, we study the holographic n-partite information in AdS-BH geometry focusing on four

and ﬁve partite information. Making use of the metric (2.2) and equations (1.5) and (A.8), one can

Note that c2(d) is a constant that depends on d, e.g. c2(3) = 0.88 and c2(4) = 0.33. Here we use the
numerical methods to compute the integrals for 0 < ρt < ρH with step of 0.00005 and  = 0.0001 which
results in lists of values for (cid:96) (ρt) and SBH (ρt). The relevant HEE is obtained in terms of the entangling
regions length by interpolating the list of {(cid:96) (ρt) , SBH (ρt)}. Fig.9 shows that numerical computations
are in good agreement with the semi-analytic ones.

Having obtained the HEE in this background, it is straightforward to study the holographic n-partite

information via (1.5). Holographically the main step is to compute the minimal surface among all possible

conﬁgurations. The strategy of ﬁnding such surface is similar to what presented in the previous section.

Therefore, we only present the results of numeric computation, mentioning that according to diﬀerent

ranges of variables in which the sign of holographic n-partite information is investigated, the minimal

conﬁgurations must be chosen. By plotting the resulting holographic four and ﬁve partite information

for various values of parameters, it is veriﬁed that the sign is ﬁxed in AdS-BH geometry; this is depicted

in Fig.s (10, 11).
In AdS4 and AdS4-BH, holographic 5-partite information seems to take either sign and we leave the
question of other possible relations as a challenge for the future.

In Ref. [13], assuming the RT formula in quantum ﬁeld theories with holographic duals, it was shown that

the mutual informations among arbitrary disjoint spatial regions A, B and C obey the inequality I(A :
B∪C) ≥ I(A : B)+I(A : C). This inequality indicates that the mutual information in monogamous. The
monogamy relation is actually characteristic of measures of quantum entanglement which suggests that

correlations in holographic theories arise primarily from entanglement rather than classical correlations.

In this paper we have mainly studied the monogamy relations for n-partite information by employing the

We have chosen parallel inﬁnite strips as the entangling regions in a constant time slice. In particular,
in order to more simplify the computations, we considered the equal width strips ((cid:96)i = (cid:96)) with the
same spatial separation (hi = h). The main diﬃculty that we encountered was to ﬁnd the minimal area
conﬁguration among the diﬀerent RT surfaces corresponding to boundary entangling regions. Actually

our assumption on the equality of the entangling regions width and separation between them reduces the

number of possible conﬁgurations signiﬁcantly. The competition between these conﬁgurations depends
on the ratio r ≡ h
In the case of 4-partite information we have shown that this quantity is always positive for both vacuum

and thermal state. Although we have performed a numerical study for various lengths and dimensions,

it seems that these results hold in general. Also, we have investigated the possible phase transitions
of 4-partite information and we have found the critical points (ri) where the corresponding minimal
conﬁgurations, i.e. RT surfaces, have been changed. In the case of 5-partite information we have found

that this quantity is always negative in the vacuum and thermal state in three dimensional background.

Again in this case, we discussed about the possible critical points and phase transitions. Making use

of equation (1.7) which gives the 5-partite information in terms of 4-partite information and the latter
result, i.e. I [5] < 0 for CFT2, it is indicated that the holographic 4-partite information is monogamous
in three dimensional AdS background.

There are several directions which one can follow to further investigate this study. One of the main

directions is to consider the time dependent backgrounds and check how the sign of these quantities

changes during the thermalization process. Another generalization is to investigate the role of Lifshitz

and hyperscaling violating exponents on these monogamy relations. We leave further investigations to

future works.

Appendix

A Holographic entanglement entropy: A short review

In this appendix, we will recall the holographic computation of the entanglement entropy whose dual

gravity is an AdS geometry given by (2.2). In order to compute the entanglement entropy of a system

described by (2.1) in the holographic context, it is needed to ﬁnd a co-dimension two surface with
minimum area in the bulk regarding the point that at the boundary this surface coincides with that

of the entangling region. To ﬁnd the minimal surface in the bulk the proﬁle can be parameterized by
x1 = x(ρ), so that the induced metric on this proﬁle is obtained as follows

Making use of the variational principle, one can minimize the proposed surface. Since the integrand is

independent of x, the corresponding momentum is a constant of motion, i.e.

Px =

∂L
∂x(cid:48) = constant.

By substituting L from (A.2) in (A.3) and doing some simpliﬁcation, one arrives to

It is noted that in general there is no analytic solution for the above equation, however, one can ﬁnd

solutions in the case of AdS geometry with f (ρ) = 1, which is dual to the vacuum state of the underlying
CFT. In this case after making use of (A.7), the turning point ρt can be written in terms of (cid:96) as follows

Therefore, the holographic entanglement entropy in AdS background is obtained as (2.3).

For f (ρ) (cid:54)= 0, in general, there is no explicit analytic expression for the entanglement entropy, however,

in some limits one can ﬁnd a semi-analytic solution as stated below.

• (cid:96) (cid:28) ρH limit:

In this limit one can expand the area (A.8) around the f = 1 which leads to the following expression
