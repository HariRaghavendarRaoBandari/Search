Abstract

A consistent Hartree-Fock study of the equation of state (EOS) of asymmetric nuclear matter

at ﬁnite temperature has been performed using realistic choices of the eﬀective, density dependent

nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction, which were successfully used in diﬀerent nuclear structure and

reaction studies. Given the importance of the nuclear symmetry energy in the neutron star for-

mation, EOS’s associated with diﬀerent behaviors of the symmetry energy were used to study hot

asymmetric nuclear matter. The slope of the symmetry energy and nucleon eﬀective mass with

increasing baryon density was found to aﬀect the thermal properties of nuclear matter signiﬁcantly.

Diﬀerent density dependent NN interactions were further used to study the EOS of hot protoneu-

tron star (PNS) matter of the npeµν composition in β-equilibrium. The hydrostatic conﬁgurations

of PNS in terms of the maximal gravitational mass Mmax and radius, central density, pressure

and temperature at the total entropy per baryon S/A = 1, 2 and 4 have been determined in both

the neutrino-free and neutrino-trapped scenarios. The obtained results show consistently a strong

impact of the symmetry energy and nucleon eﬀective mass on thermal properties and composition

of hot PNS matter. Mmax values obtained for the (neutrino-free) β-stable PNS at S/A = 4 were

used to assess time tBH of the collapse of 40 M⊙ protoneutron progenitor to black hole, based on

a correlation between tBH and Mmax found from the hydrodynamic simulation by Hempel et al..

INTRODUCTION

A realistic equation of state (EOS) of asymmetric nuclear matter (NM) is the most vital

input for the study of the neutron star formation [1–6], and the determination of the EOS

has been, therefore, the focus of many nuclear structure and reaction studies involving exotic

nuclei lying close to the driplines. The key quantity to distinguish the diﬀerent nuclear EOS’s

is the nuclear mean-ﬁeld potential that can be obtained from a consistent mean-ﬁeld study,

like the relativistic mean-ﬁeld (RMF) [7] or Hartree-Fock (HF) [8] calculations of NM using

the realistic interaction between nucleons in the high-density nuclear medium. As such,

the diﬀerent nuclear EOS’s have been used in the hydrodynamic simulation of core-collapse

supernovae [9, 10] to study the hot protoneutron star (PNS) formed in the aftermath of

supernovae [11–13] and its collapse to black hole or evolution towards cold neutron star.

The latter is an extensive research object of numerous nuclear many-body studies (see, e.g.,

Refs. [8, 14–16, 18, 19]).

The microscopic many-body studies, like the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) calculations

[12, 16, 17], have shown the important role played by the Pauli blocking eﬀects as well as the

higher-order nucleon-nucleon (NN) correlations at large NM densities. Such medium eﬀects

serve as the physics origin of the empirical density dependence introduced into various

versions of the eﬀective NN interactions being widely used in the nuclear structure and

reaction studies. Quite popular are the density dependent versions of the M3Y interaction

(originally constructed in terms of three Yukawas to reproduce the G-matrix elements of

the Reid [20] and Paris [21] NN potentials in an oscillator basis), which have been applied

successfully in the folding model studies of nuclear scattering [22–25] or in the HF structure

calculations of ﬁnite nuclei [26–28]. The diﬀerent versions of the density dependent M3Y

interaction have been used recently, together with the D1S and D1N versions of Gogny

interaction [29, 30] and SLy4 version [32] of Skyrme interaction [31], to study the basic

properties of asymmetric NM at zero temperature [19] as well as the β-stable matter of

cold neutron star [8]. While all these interactions give about the same description of the

saturation properties of symmetric NM, the HF results for asymmetric NM [19] show that

they are roughly divided into two groups that are associated with two diﬀerent (so-called

soft and stiﬀ ) behaviors of the nuclear symmetry energy at high NM densities.

In the

soft scenario, the symmetry energy changes its slope and decreases at high NM densities,

2

resulting on a drastic decrease of the proton and lepton components in the core of neutron

star that then becomes β-unstable. A very small proton fraction in neutron star matter

given by the soft-type mean-ﬁeld potentials excludes the direct Urca (DU) process in the

neutron star cooling, whereas the DU process is well possible in the β-equilibrated neutron

star matter predicted by the stiﬀ-type mean ﬁeld potentials [8]. A vital role of the nuclear

symmetry energy has also been illustrated with the density dependent M3Y interaction,

where a signiﬁcant reduction of the maximum gravitational mass and radius of neutron star

was found when the slope of the symmetry energy was changed from the stiﬀ behavior to

the soft one [8].

Because the composition and physical conditions of a hot newly born PNS are quite

diﬀerent from those of a cold and lepton-poor neutron star, it is of high interest to extend

the mean-ﬁeld approach of Ref. [8] to the study of the hot baryon matter of PNS, and

explore the sensitivity of the PNS composition to the nuclear symmetry energy at ﬁnite

temperature and entropy as well as the eﬀects caused by neutrino trapping. For this purpose,

the reliability of the present HF approach was tested ﬁrst in the mean-ﬁeld study of hot and

dense asymmetric NM, and the results are presented in Sec. II. These results turn out to

be quite complementary to those of the recent mean-ﬁeld studies of thermal properties of

asymmetric NM using diﬀerent choices of the in-medium NN interaction [33–35] as well as

the RMF studies [36, 37]. The HF results obtained for the EOS of hot β-stable PNS matter

in both the ν-free and ν-trapped scenarios are presented in Sec. III, where the impact of

the nuclear symmetry energy and nucleon eﬀective mass on the hydrostatic conﬁguration

of hot PNS at the total entropy per baryon S/A = 1, 2 and 4 was found very signiﬁcant.

The ν-free PNS conﬁguration at S/A = 4 was studied in details in view of the results of

hydrodynamic simulation by Hempel et al.

[9], which show that the neutrino-poor PNS

matter with S/A ≈ 4 occurs at the onset of a 40 M⊙ protonneutron progenitor collapse to

black hole. The summary and main conclusions of the present research are given in Sec. V.

II. HARTREE-FOCK CALCULATION OF HOT NUCLEAR MATTER

In our consistent HF approach, we consider a homogeneous spin-saturated NM over a

wide range of the neutron and proton number densities, nn and np, or equivalently of the

total nucleon number density nb = nn + np (hereafter referred to as baryon density) and the

3

neutron-proton asymmetry δ = (nn − np)/(nn + np). Given the direct (vD) and exchange

(vEX) parts of the (central) in-medium NN interaction vc, the total energy density of NM at

the given baryon density and temperature T is determined as

E(T, nb, δ) = Ekin(T, nb, δ) + Epot(T, nb, δ),

where the kinetic and HF potential energy densities are determined as

Ekin(T, nb, δ) = Xkστ

The single-particle wave function |kστ i is plane wave, and the summation in Eqs. (2)-(4)

is done separately over the neutron (τ = n) and proton (τ = p) single-particle indices. The

nucleon momentum distribution nστ (k, T ) in the hot, spin-saturated NM is given by the

Fermi-Dirac distribution

nστ (k, T ) ≡ nτ (nb, k, δ, T ) =

1

1 + exp{[ετ (nb, k, δ, T ) − µτ ]/T }

.

(5)

Here T is the temperature (in MeV) and µτ is the nucleon chemical potential. The single-

particle energy ετ is given by

ετ (nb, k, δ, T ) =

∂E(T )

∂nτ (nb, k, δ, T )

which is the change of the total NM energy caused by the removal or addition of a nucleon

with the momentum k. At zero temperature, the nucleon momentum distribution (5) is
reduced to the step function determined with the Fermi momentum k(τ )

At zero temperature, when the nucleon momentum approaches the Fermi momentum (k →
k(τ )
F ), ετ (nb, k(τ )
F , δ, T = 0) determined from Eqs. (6)-(10) is exactly the Fermi energy given
by the Hugenholtz - van Hove theorem [38], which gives rise naturally to the RT of the

single-particle potential if the in-medium NN interaction vc is density dependent. At ﬁnite

temperature T , the single-particle potential (8) is determined by an iterative procedure, with

the chemical potential µτ being determined at each iteration by normalizing the nucleon

momentum distribution (5) to the nucleon number density nτ

nτ =

g

(2π)3Z nτ (nb, k, δ, T )dk,

(11)

where g = 2 is the spin degeneracy factor. The thermodynamic equilibrium of hot NM is

directly associated with the evolution of the entropy. Given the NM energy density obtained

microscopically (in terms of the nucleon degrees of freedom) in the HF calculation (1)-(4)

using the realistic eﬀective NN interaction between nucleons in medium, it is natural to

determine the baryon entropy density S of asymmetric NM on the same level, using the

functional form for the entropy density of a Fermi-Dirac gas at the given temperature T and

baryon density nb

S(T, nb, δ) =

g

8π3Xτ Z {nτ (nb, k, δ, T ) ln[nτ (nb, k, δ, T )]

+ [1 − nτ (nb, k, δ, T )] ln[1 − nτ (nb, k, δ, T )]}dk.

(12)

Thus, the entropy density (12) is aﬀected by diﬀerent nuclear EOS’s via the corresponding

nucleon mean-ﬁeld potentials entering the nucleon momentum distribution (5).

The Helmholtz free energy density is determined as F (T ) = E(T ) − T S(T ). Dividing

(1) and (12) over the total baryon number density nb, we obtain the internal energy per

particle E(T )/A and the entropy per particle S(T )/A that are used to determine the (density

Thus, the EOS at ﬁnite temperature is given by Eq. (13). The diﬀerent EOS’s of symmetric

Like in Ref. [8], we have used in the present HF calculation two diﬀerent sets of the

density-dependent M3Y interaction. The ﬁrst set, dubbed as CDM3Yn (n=3,6), is the orig-

inal M3Y-Paris interaction [21] supplemented by an isoscalar (IS) density dependence that

was parametrized [23] to reproduce the saturation properties of cold symmetric NM and

give the diﬀerent nuclear incompressibilities K0 shown in Table I. These interactions, espe-

cially the CDM3Y6 version, have been widely tested in numerous folding model analyses

of the nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering [25] and charge-exchange scattering to the isobar

analog states [24, 47]. The isovector (IV) density dependence of the CDM3Yn interaction

was ﬁrst parametrized to reproduce the BHF results for the density- and isospin depen-

dent nucleon optical potential of Jeukenne, Lejeune and Mahaux (JLM) [48, 49]. Then, the

6

total IV strength of the CDM3Yn interaction was ﬁne-tuned to reproduce the measured

charge-exchange (p, n) and (3He,t) data for the isobar analog states [24, 47]. In our recent

extended HF study of the single-particle potential in the NM [39], the parameters of the IV

density dependence of the CDM3Yn interactions have been redetermined with a consistent

inclusion of the rearrangement term into the single-nucleon potential at diﬀerent NM den-

sities. At variance with the CDM3Yn interactions, the M3Y-Pn interactions (n=5 and 7)

have been carefully parametrized by Nakada [26–28] in terms of the ﬁnite-range M3Y inter-

action supplemented with a zero-range density-dependent term, to consistently reproduce

the NM saturation properties and ground-state (g.s.) structure of the stable nuclei as well

as the dripline nuclei. In particular, the newly parametrized M3Y-P7 version [28] gives a

stable description of symmetric NM up to the baryon density as high as 6n0, while retaining

a realistic description of the g.s.

structure of ﬁnite nuclei. For comparison, the present

HF calculation has also been done using the two other popular choices of the eﬀective NN

interaction: the D1N version of Gogny interaction [30] and SLy4 version [31] of Skyrme

interaction [32]. The explicit parametrizations of the density dependent NN interactions

used in the present HF calculation are presented and discussed in more details in Appen-

dices A and B. The NM saturation properties at zero temperature given by diﬀerent density

dependent interactions are presented in Table I. One can see that all interactions under

study give reasonable description of the bulk properties of NM at the saturation density n0,

excepting the nucleon eﬀective mass given by the M3Y-Pn interactions that is signiﬁcantly

lower than the empirical value around 0.72 [50]. Given the HF mean ﬁeld potentials based

on various density dependent NN interactions (see Table I), it is important to make some

comparison of the present HF results with those of a microscopic many-body calculation

starting from the realistic free NN interaction. In the present work we have focused on the

microscopic EOS of hot asymmetric NM from the BHF calculation by Burgio and Schulze

[12], using the Argonne NN interaction (V18 version [51] with the Urbana three-body force).

This microscopic EOS has been used to study the composition of hot β-stable PNS matter

and estimate the maximum gravitational mass of PNS at entropy S/A=1 and 2. One can

see in Fig. 1 that the HF results obtained with the CDM3Y6 and CDM3Y3 interactions

for the free energy per particle F/A at diﬀerent temperatures are in good agreement with

the microscopic BHF results (reproduced here from the analytical expressions ﬁtted by the

authors of Ref. [12]). A slight diﬀerence between the results given by the CDM3Y6 and

BHF results (symbols) by Burgio and Schulze [12].

CDM3Y3 interactions at high NM densities is mainly due to the diﬀerent incompressibilities

K0 given by these two interactions. Over the whole range of NM densities up to nb = 1

fm−3, the F/A values given by the CDM3Y6 interaction are very close to the BHF results

[12]. The F/A values given by the M3Y-P5 and M3Y-P7 interactions are compared with

the BHF results in Fig. 2, and a better agreement with the BHF results for pure neutron

matter is achieved with the newly parametrized and improved M3Y-P7 version [28]. A

similar comparison of the free energy given by the D1N version [30] of Gogny interaction

and SLy4 version [32] of Skyrme interaction with the BHF results is shown in Fig. 3. We

found that the results given by the D1N interaction for pure neutron matter diﬀer strongly

from the BHF results at high NM densities, while those given by the Sly4 interaction agree

reasonably with the BHF results for both the symmetric NM and pure neutron matter over

a wide range of NM densities. Note that the free energy given by Sly4 interaction at high

with the zero-range Skyrme interaction [see Appendix B] is temperature independent.

neutron-proton asymmetry δ can then be estimated using Eq. (16). However, as shown

below, the quadratic approximation (16) becomes much poorer with the increasing δ and T .

In fact, the quadratic approximation is reasonable only for the internal symmetry energy

the considered NN interactions. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the free symmetry energy pre-

dicted by the HF calculation using the CDM3Y6 and CDM3Y3 interactions agree well with

the BHF results. Because the isovector density dependence of these two interactions has

been ﬁne tuned [24, 39] to reproduce the density dependence of the nucleon optical potential

obtained in the BHF calculation by the JLM group [48], both the CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y6

interactions give a stiﬀ density dependence of the free symmetry energy at diﬀerent tem-

peratures. To illustrate this we also used the soft versions (CDM3Y3s and CDM3Y6s) of

these interactions, where the IV density dependence F1(nb) was assumed to be the same as

the IS density dependence F0(nb) [8]. One can see that the soft free symmetry energy fails

to agree with the BHF results soon after the baryon density exceeds the saturation density

n0 (see lower panel of Fig. 4). The free symmetry energy given by the M3Y-Pn, D1N, and

SLy4 interactions also disagree strongly with the BHF results (see Fig. 5) at high NM densi-

ties, although the isospin dependence of these interactions was carefully tailored to give the

good description of the g.s. structure of the neutron-rich dripline nuclei [27, 28, 30]. These

two diﬀerent behaviors have been observed earlier [19] and are discussed in the literature

as the asy-stiﬀ (with the symmetry energy steadily increasing with the NM density) and

asy-soft (with the symmetry energy reaching its saturation and then decreasing to negative

values at high NM densities) behaviors. In this context, the CDM3Y3, CDM3Y6, and Sly4

interactions are asy-stiﬀ, while the CDM3Y3s, CDM3Y6s, M3Y-P5, M3Y-P7, and D1N in-

teractions are asy-soft. It can be seen in Figs. 4 and 5 that the ﬁnite-temperature eﬀect

does not change this classiﬁcation. It should be noted that, like the BHF calculation, the

most recent nonrelativistic mean-ﬁeld studies of hot asymmetric NM [33, 34] as well as the

RMF studies [36, 37] also predict the asy-stiﬀ behavior of the free symmetry energy.

We have further checked the dependence of the free symmetry energy on the neutron-

proton asymmetry δ by performing ﬁnite-temperature HF calculations at diﬀerent δ values,

FIG. 6: (Color online) Free symmetry energy (15) (lower panel) and internal symmetry energy (17)

(upper panel) at diﬀerent temperatures, given by the HF calculation using the CDM3Y6 interaction

[39]. (Fsym/A)/δ2 curves must be very close if the quadratic approximation (16) is valid.

and it turned out that the quadratic approximation (16) becomes much poorer with the

increasing temperature as shown in lower panel of Fig. 6, where all (Fsym/A)/δ2 curves

should be very close if the quadratic approximation (16) is valid. Such a breakdown of

the quadratic approximation, sometimes also dubbed as the parabolic law, is clearly due

to the eﬀect of ﬁnite entropy. Therefore, the free symmetry energy of hot asymmetric NM

needs to be calculated explicitly at diﬀerent neutron-proton asymmetries δ without using

the approximation (16). To further illustrate this eﬀect, we have plotted the HF results for

the internal symmetry energy per particle Esym/A in the upper panel of Fig. 6, and one

can see that the quadratic approximation (17) remains reasonable for Esym/A at diﬀerent

temperatures.

At zero temperature, εsym determined at the saturation density nb = n0 is known as the

symmetry energy coeﬃcient J which has been predicted by numerous many-body calcula-

tions to be around 30 MeV. The symmetry energy of cold NM can be expanded around n0

where L and Ksym are the slope and curvature parameters of the symmetry energy. The

asymmetric NM with the neutron-proton asymmetry δ . 0.75 can still be saturated by

the nuclear mean ﬁeld, but at the baryon number density siginiﬁcantly lower than that of

symmetric NM (nδ < n0) [22]. As shown by Piekarewicz and Centelles [41], the nuclear

incompressibility at the new saturation density nδ can be approximated by a quadratic

dependence on the neutron-proton asymmetry δ

K(nδ) ≈ K0 + Kτ δ2 + O(δ4).

(21)

We have calculated the symmetry term Kτ of the nuclear incompressibility K(nδ) based on

Eq. (18c) in Ref. [41], using diﬀerent density dependent NN interactions under the present

study. The obtained Kτ values of -180 to -395 MeV (see Table I) turned out to be smaller (in
|Kτ | value) than K (exp)

≈ −550±100 MeV deduced from the measured strength distribution

τ

of giant monopole resonance (GMR) in neutron-rich tin isotopes [42]. Such a disagreement

was found also with diﬀerent versions of Skyrme interaction [42] and FSUGold interaction

that was well tested in the RMF studies of GMR in heavy nuclei [41]. This remains an

open question that might be linked to large uncertainties in extrapolating Kτ values for

asymmetric NM from the GMR data measured for ﬁnite nuclei [41].

The knowledge about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is vital

for the construction of the EOS of asymmetric NM. The widely used method to probe the

NM symmetry energy associated (in the mean-ﬁeld scheme) with a given in-medium NN

interaction is to test such an interaction in the nuclear reaction and/or the nuclear structure

studies involving nuclei with the large neutron excess. Based on the physics constraints

implied by such studies, the extrapolation is made to draw the conclusion on the low- and

high-density behavior of the symmetry energy (see a recent review [43] for more details).

For example, the parameters J, L, and Ksym of the expansion (20) have been the subject of

several nuclear structure studies, where one tries to deduce constraints for these 3 parameters

from the observation of the monopole, dipole, and spin-dipole resonances [44]. Note that

higher-order term O(δ4) in the expansion (17) of the symmetry energy at zero temperature

might be needed for a more precise determination of the slope parameter L [45]. Quite a

robust constraint for both the J and L values has been established [46] based on several tens

analyses of the terrestrial nuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations, which

give J ≈ 31.6 ± 2.7 MeV and L ≈ 58.9 ± 16.0 MeV. Using the parameters of the isovector

density dependence of the CDM3Yn interactions determined recently in Ref. [39], the values

J ≈ 30.1 MeV and L ≈ 49.7 MeV given by the HF calculation of cold asymmetric NM are

well within this empirical range. In our previous HF study [8] of cold (β-stable) neutron

star matter, the baryon and lepton compositions in the core of neutron star as well as its

maximum gravitational mass and radius were shown to be strongly aﬀected by the slope

of the nuclear symmetry energy at high baryon densities. The extension of the mean-ﬁeld

approach of Ref. [8] to study the impact of the symmetry energy to the composition of hot

β-stable PNS matter is presented in the next Section.

B. The nucleon eﬀective mass and thermal properties of NM

A very important physics quantity associated with the momentum dependence of the

single-nucleon potential (8) is the (density dependent) nucleon eﬀective mass, determined

within the nonrelativistic mean-ﬁeld formalism as

where m is the free nucleon mass. Given the ﬁnite range of the Yukawa (or Gaussian)

function used to construct the radial part of the CDM3Yn, M3Y-Pn, and Gogny interactions,

the single-particle potential depends explicitly on the nucleon momentum k via its exchange

term [see Eqs. (A20) and (A25) in Appendix A] that implies a nonlocal single-particle

potential in the coordinate space. Therefore, the nucleon eﬀective mass m∗ is a measure

of nonlocality of the mean-ﬁeld potential felt by a nucleon propagating in nuclear medium.

Because of the zero range of Skyrme interaction, the corresponding mean-ﬁeld potential

is always local, and the momentum dependence of Skyrme interaction has to be included

explicitly [see Eq. (B1) in Appendix B]. In general, the nucleon eﬀective mass is linked

closely to several important nuclear physics phenomena, like the dynamics of HI collisions,

damping of giant resonances, temperature proﬁle and cooling of hot PNS and neutrino

emission therefrom [11, 52, 53]. Moreover, the density dependence of nucleon eﬀective mass

was shown to be directly related to the thermodynamic properties of NM [11, 54]. For

example, in the degenerate limit of symmetric NM or pure neutron matter with T ≪ TF , the

entropy per particle and temperature at the given Fermi momentum kF can be approximately

expressed [11] as

For a comparison with the BHF results for the nucleon eﬀective mass at diﬀerent NM

densities [52], we have evaluated the neutron- and proton eﬀective mass (22) from the HF

single-particle potential at zero temperature. The density dependence of the neutron- and

proton eﬀective mass at diﬀerent neutron-proton asymmetries δ given by diﬀerent density

dependent NN interactions are compared with the BHF results in Figs. 7 and 8. To be

consistent with the discussion on results shown in Figs. 1-5, we have plotted in Figs. 7 and 8

formulas ﬁtted by the authors of Ref. [52]) which were also obtained with the V18 version

of Argonne NN interaction [51] supplemented by the phenomenological Urbana three-body

force. We found that only the CDM3Yn interactions give the neutron- and proton eﬀective

mass behaving similarly to that predicted by the BHF calculation. Namely, the m∗

τ /m value
decreases to some minimum at the baryon density nb ≈ 0.2 fm−3 and then rises up to above

unity at high baryon densities. Such a saturation trend of the nucleon eﬀective mass was

shown in the BHF calculation to be entirely due to the repulsive contribution by the three-

body force (see Fig. 1 of Ref. [52]). The rise at high densities of the m∗

τ /m value given by the
CDM3Y6 interaction is stiﬀer than that given by the CDM3Y3 interaction, and this eﬀect

(observed at both δ = 0 and δ 6= 0) is mainly due to diﬀerent nuclear incompressibilities

K0 of cold symmetric NM determined with diﬀerent IS density dependence F0(nb) of these

interactions [see Eq. (A4) in Appendix A]. The D1N version of Gogny interaction gives a

rather slowly decreasing m∗

τ /m value with the increasing baryon density (see right panel of

Fig. 7), and such a behavior of the nucleon eﬀective mass is similar to that obtained in the

a behavior seems not realistic and totally opposite to that predicted by the microscopic BHF

calculation [52].

The diﬀerence in nucleon eﬀective masses given by diﬀerent density dependent NN in-

teractions shown in Figs. 7 and 8 is very signiﬁcant at high baryon densities, and it must

show up, therefore, also in the HF results for thermal properties of NM [11, 54]. As an illus-

tration, the density proﬁle of temperature of the isentropic and symmetric NM at S/A = 1

and 2 deduced from the HF results given by diﬀerent density dependent NN interactions is

compared with that given by the full degeneracy limit (23) in Fig. 9. One can see that at low

temperatures (or S/A = 1) the HF results are rather close to those given by Eq. (23). At

S/A = 2 the temperature predicted by the HF calculation is larger than that given by the

degeneracy limit over the whole density range, and the approximation (23) becomes worse

at high baryon densities. Nevertheless, the trend of temperature T being proportional to the

Fermi temperature TF (or inversely proportional to nucleon eﬀective mass) seems to hold,

and at the given baryon density the lower the nucleon eﬀective mass m∗ the higher the NM

temperature T . Given very low nucleon eﬀective masses at high baryon densities predicted

by the M3Y-Pn and Sly4 interactions compared to those predicted by the CDM3Yn and

D1N interactions (see Fig 8), the NM temperatures predicted by the M3Y-Pn and Sly4

interactions are also substantially higher than those predicted by the CDM3Yn and D1N

interactions at high baryon densities (see Fig 9). This result shows clearly a strong impact

of the nucleon eﬀective mass to the thermodynamic properties of NM.

The behavior of entropy is also an important thermodynamic property associated with

the given EOS of hot NM (through the single-particle potential embedded in the nucleon

momentum distribution used to estimate S/A). Although a constant S/A = 1 ∼ 2 was often

assumed for the hydrostatic conﬁguration of PNS [11], a recent hydrodynamic simulation

of black hole formation in a failed core-collapse supernova [9] has shown that entropy per

baryon S/A ≈ 4 is reached at the onset of collapse of the massive (40 M⊙) PNS to black hole.

Therefore, the present HF calculation of hot NM has been extended to high temperatures

T that correspond to S/A = 4. At T 6 50 MeV, the density proﬁles of entropy given by the

present HF calculation are compared in Figs. 10-12 with those given by the BHF calculation

[12] of symmetric NM and pure neutron matter (reproduced here from the ﬁtted analytical

expressions of the free energy in the temperature range 0 6 T 6 50 MeV [12]).

One can see in Fig. 10 that S/A values obtained with both the CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y6

interactions agree reasonably well with those given by the BHF calculation at diﬀerent NM

densities. At high densities up to nb = 1 fm−3, the S/A values given by the CDM3Y3

interaction agree better with those given by the BHF calculation [12] (see right panel of

[30] of Gogny interaction and SLy4 version [32] of Skyrme interaction.

Fig. 10). Such a diﬀerence in the calculated S/A values is directly resulted from the diﬀerence

in the free energy per particle F/A (see Fig. 1), because entropy at the given baryon density

can also be determined from the derivative of the free energy with respect to the temperature,

instead of using Eq. (12). Therefore, the diﬀerent behaviors of S/A values obtained with

the two CDM3Yn interactions (found at both δ = 0 and δ = 1) are due mainly to diﬀerent

nuclear incompressibilities K0 given by these two interactions, like discussed above for the

behavior of nucleon eﬀective mass. Recall that the CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y6 interactions

give K0 ≈ 217 and 252 MeV, respectively, compared with K0 ≈ 210 MeV given by the BHF

calculation [12]. The density proﬁle of S/A values given by the other interactions are plotted

in Figs. 11 and 12, and the agreement with the BHF results becomes worse, especially for

the Sly4 version of Skyrme interaction. The diﬀerence between S/A values given by the HF

calculation using Sly4 interaction and those given by the BHF calculation is likely due to the

drastic diﬀerence in the nucleon eﬀective masses at high baryon densities (see right panel of

the curves well distinguishable at diﬀerent T .

Fig. 8) which implies diﬀerent momentum dependences of the single-particle potential (the

key input for the HF calculation of thermal properties of NM). To explore how strong is

the eﬀect caused by diﬀerent behaviors of the nuclear symmetry energy, we have plotted in

Fig. 13 the symmetry part of entropy per particle (in terms of T Ssym/A) of pure neutron

matter at diﬀerent temperatures, given by the CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y6 interactions [23, 39]

and their soft CDM3Y3s and CDM3Y6s versions [8]. These two groups of the CDM3Yn

interactions were shown in Fig. 4 to give very diﬀerent behaviors of the free symmetry energy

at high baryon densities. As can be seen in Fig. 13, the maximal T Ssym/A values associated

with the stiﬀ symmetry energy is slightly higher than that associated with the soft symmetry

energy. However, the stiﬀ-soft diﬀerence shown in Fig. 13 is not as drastic as that found

in the free symmetry energy given by the CDM3Yn interactions and their soft versions at

22

diﬀerent temperatures (see Fig. 4).

In conclusion, the diﬀerent behaviors of entropy with the increasing baryon density shown

in Figs. 10-12 is due to diﬀerence in the momentum dependence of single-particle potential

used to construct the nucleon momentum distribution (5), the main input for the determi-

nation of entropy (12). This is also the source of diﬀerence in the nucleon eﬀective mass

obtained with diﬀerent density dependent NN interactions shown in Figs. 7-8. In the same

manner, a slight diﬀerence shown in Fig. 13 for the symmetry part of entropy per particle

should be due to diﬀerent the momentum dependences of the IV term of single-particle po-

tential obtained with the CDM3Yn interactions and their soft CDM3Yns versions. This is

directly related to the diﬀerence between the stiﬀ- and soft symmetry-energy scenarios.

III. EOS OF HOT β-STABLE PNS MATTER

To study the β-stable hydrostatic conﬁguration of PNS, one needs to keep the β equi-

librium between n, p and e, µ, ν, and to combine the EOS of uniform matter in the core

with an EOS of the hot PNS crust. We have considered, therefore, the EOS given by the

RMF calculation by Shen et al. [7] (the improved version of 2011 [55]) for the PNS crust.

The EOS of hot inhomogeneous PNS crust given by the RMF calculation was used for the

baryon number densities up to the edge density nedge ≈ 0.05 fm−3, and the EOS of the
uniform PNS matter given by our HF calculation has been used for nb & 0.08 fm−3 fol-
lowing a brief transition region 0.05 . nb . 0.08 fm−3 shown as dotted lines in Fig. 14.

The energy and pressure in the transition region were determined by a spline procedure

to ensure their smooth and continuous behavior from the inner crust to the uniform core.

The transition density assumed in the present work is rather close to that found recently in

a dynamical mean-ﬁeld study of hot neutron star matter using the momentum-dependent

eﬀective interaction [56].

The uniform PNS core is assumed to be homogeneous matter of neutrons, protons, elec-

trons, neutrinos, and muons (µ− appear at nb above the muon threshold density, where
electron chemical potential µe > mµc2 ≈ 105.6 MeV). In the present work, we have consid-

ered two diﬀerent scenarios for neutrinos in the PNS matter: ν-free (neutrinos are absent)

and ν-trapped (the PNS matter is opaque [2] and neutrinos are trapped inside the PNS).

Thus, the total free energy density F of PNS matter is determined at the given baryon

Eb(T, nb) = E(T, nb) + nnmnc2 + npmpc2,

and Fl(T, nb) = Xi=e,µ,ν

[Ei(T, nb, ni) − T Si(T, nb, ni)].

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

Here E(T, nb) is the HF energy density of baryons (1) and Sb(T, nb) is the corresponding

baryon entropy density (12). The summation in (27) is done over all leptons under consid-

eration, with the energy Ei and entropy Si of the i-kind lepton evaluated in the relativistic

24

(non-interacting) Fermi gas model [6]. The EOS of PNS matter is usually discussed in terms

of the total free energy per baryon and total entropy per baryon determined as

≡ [Fb(nb, T ) + Fl(nb, T )]/nb

≡ [Sb(nb, T ) + Xi=e,µ,ν

(28)

(29)

The chemical potentials of the constituent particles of PNS matter are constrained by the

condition of β-equilibrium

µn − µp = µe − µνe = µµ − µνµ.

(30)

With the fraction of the k-kind constituent particle determined at the baryon number density

nb as xk = nk/nb, the charge neutrality condition of β-stable PNS matter implies

xp + Xi=e,µ,ν

qixi = 0,

(31)

where qi is the charge of the i-kind lepton. The conservation of the weak charge leads to the

conservation of the lepton fractions determined as

Yl = xl − x¯l + xνl − x¯νl,

l = e, µ.

(32)

Because of dynamical neutrino trapping during the core collapse [1], neutrinos are trapped

during the ﬁrst instants of the PNS [2, 11]. At the onset of neutrino trapping occuring at

ρb ∼ 1011g/cm3 [61], the electron lepton fraction is expected to be Ye ≈ 0.4 [11–13]. When

the electron lepton fraction is ﬁxed, the conversion of electrons to muons at high densities is

unlikely and the muon lepton fraction can be assumed Yµ ≈ 0 [11, 12]. These assumptions

for the ν-trapped PNS matter, together with a chosen EOS for the baryon matter, are the

constraints used to determine the npeµν composition of the β-stable, ν-trapped PNS matter.

In the ν-free case, these conditions are simpliﬁed by setting all neutrino fractions to zero.

We note that at very low baryon densities of nb < 10−5 fm−3 neutrinos are no more trapped

inside the dilute PNS atmosphere and become almost free [59]. We have chosen, therefore,

also a “cut-oﬀ”’ procedure to impose the electron fraction xe ≈ 0.4 at nb . 10−5 fm−3and

the dilute PNS atmosphere is treated as ν-free.

At zero temperature, a simple relation linking µn − µp and the nuclear symmetry energy

based on the parabolic approximation (16) is often used to determine the proton, electron

and muon fractions of β-stable matter [8]. Because the parabolic approximation becomes

poorer with the increasing temperature as shown in Sect. II, we avoid using it in the present

HF calculation. Thus, at each temperature T the EOS associated with a given eﬀective

NN interaction is ﬁrst constructed in a dense grid of the neutron-proton asymmetries δ

and baryon number densities nb. Then, at the given temperature and baryon density, the

actual asymmetry parameter δ is obtained by ensuring the conditions of β-equilibrium (24),

charge neutrality (31) and lepton number conservation (32). At each step of this variation

procedure, the chemical potentials of constituent particles are determined by normalizing

the Fermi-Dirac momentum distribution to the corresponding number density at the given

T, nb, and δ. With the obtained PNS composition, the temperature dependent EOS of

β-stable npeµν matter is fully given by the total free energy density F (T, nb) determined by

Like the lepton internal energy Ei, the pressure of the i-kind lepton Pi is also determined

by the relativistic free Fermi gas model [6]. The total entropy density S(T, nb) at each

baryon density was also determined in a dense grid of diﬀerent temperatures T , so that the

isentropic behavior of all considered thermodynamic quantities can be easily interpolated at

diﬀerent baryon densities. For example, the total pressure P representing the EOS of the

isentropic, ν-free and ν-trapped β-stable matter is shown in Fig. 14. One can see that the

diﬀerence between the soft- and stiﬀ symmetry energy scenarios is quite signiﬁcant in the

ν-free case, while it becomes somewhat weaker for the ν-trapped PNS matter.

27

At variance with the HF calculation of NM, the neutron-proton asymmetry δ in the

β-stable PNS matter becomes a thermodynamic quantity, determined consistently by the

(equilibrated) neutron and proton fractions at temperature T and baryon number density nb.

The δ values given by the HF calculation using the CDM3Y6 and CDM3Y6s interactions for

the isentropic β-stable npeµν matter at the total entropy per baryon S/A = 1, 2 and 4 are

shown in Fig. 15. One can see that for both the stiﬀ- and soft symmetry-energy scenarios,

the hot PNS matter with high entropy of S/A = 4 becomes more proton rich compared to

that at the lower temperature or entropy. In the ν-free case (see left panel of Fig. 15), the δ

value given by the stiﬀ CDM3Y6 interaction at S/A = 1, 2 decreases gradually from about

0.9 at low densities to around 0.5 at nb = 1 fm−3. The same trend was found at S/A = 4,

but the matter is more symmetric or more proton rich. The behavior of δ value given by the

soft CDM3Y6s interaction at entropy S/A = 1, 2 is similar to that found earlier [8] for the

β-stable matter at zero temperature, with the core matter remaining very neutron rich over

the whole density range. As temperature increases to the thermal equilibrium at S/A = 4,

the diﬀerence between the two scenarios for the symmetry energy becomes less sizable and

δ value decreases to around 0.25-0.45 at the highest baryon density. The neutrino trapping

was found to make the diﬀerence between the stiﬀ and soft symmetry-energy scenarios less

signiﬁcant (see right panel of Fig. 15), with the matter becoming more proton rich over a

wide range of baryon densities. Such an enhancement of the proton fraction in PNS matter

by neutrino trapping was also found in the BHF calculation by Vida˜na et al.

[57] that

includes hyperons. The suppression of the impact of the nuclear symmetry energy in the

presence of trapped neutrinos is mainly explained by the fact that the PNS matter is more

symmetric and weak processes, like p + e− ↔ n + νe, can proceed in both directions. It

is clearly seen in Fig. 15 that the more symmetric matter the less impact of the symmetry

energy. This eﬀect is also illustrated in the density proﬁles of entropy and temperature of the

β-stable PNS matter given by the CDM3Y6 and CDM3Y6s interactions shown in Fig. 16.

One can see on the left panel of Fig. 16 that in the ν-free case, the diﬀerence between the stiﬀ

and soft symmetry-energy scenarios is strongest at high baryon densities so that the center

of PNS becomes much hotter when the symmetry energy is soft. Such an impact to the

density proﬁles of entropy and temperature by the symmetry energy is, however, suppressed

in the presence of trapped neutrinos (see right panel of Fig. 16).

Beside the symmetry energy, the impact of nucleon eﬀective mass to the thermal prop-

explore the eﬀect of m∗

τ in the β-stable PNS matter at diﬀerent temperatures and entropy.

The density proﬁles of neutron and proton eﬀective masses in the ν-free and β-stable PNS

matter at entropy per baryon S/A = 1, 2 and 4, obtained with diﬀerent density dependent

NN interactions are shown in Figs. 17 and 18. One can see that the density dependence

of nucleon eﬀective mass in the hot β-stable PNS matter is quite similar to that at zero

temperature shown in Figs. 7 and 8. While nucleon eﬀective mass given by the CDM3Y6

interaction saturates at nb ≈ 0.2 fm−3 and rises up to above unity at high baryon densities
(in agreement with the BHF calculation [52] that includes 3-body forces), the m∗

τ values

given by other interactions steadily decrease with the increasing baryon density. The fall of

nucleon eﬀective mass given by the M3Y-P7 and Sly4 interactions is very drastic at high

densities and it should result, therefore, on very high temperature in the center of PNS.

in Fig. 19. It can be seen that the rise of temperature with the increasing baryon density

given by the M3Y-P7 and Sly4 interactions is indeed very stiﬀ, to T above 200 MeV at

high densities. We will see below that such diﬀerent behaviors of nucleon eﬀective mass also

inﬂuence strongly the hydrostatic conﬁguration of hot PNS.

Based on diﬀerent EOS’s given by diﬀerent density dependent NN interactions, the com-

position of the β-stable PNS in terms of the constituent-particle fractions at entropy per

baryon S/A = 1, 2 and 4 is quite diﬀerent (see Figs. 20-23). The results shown in Figs. 20

and 22 were obtained for the ν-free PNS matter that corresponds the late stage of the evolu-

tion of PNS when most of neutrinos have escaped from the core. In this case the diﬀerence

between the stiﬀ- and soft symmetry-energy scenarios is quite signiﬁcant as discussed above

for the neutron-proton asymmetry. A comparison with the BHF results obtained for the

β-stable PNS matter at entropy S/A = 1, 2 (see upper panels of Figs. 20 and 22, and Fig. 4

of Ref. [12]) shows that the asy-stiﬀ interactions (CDM3Y3, CDM3Y6, and SLy4) give the

results rather close to the BHF results, while the results given by the asy-soft interactions

(CDM3Y3s, CDM3Y6s, and M3Y-P7) are very diﬀerent from the BHF results. The results

shown in Figs. 21 and 23 were obtained for the ν-trapped PNS matter with the electron

lepton fraction Ye ≈ 0.4, as expected during the ﬁrst stage of the core-collapse supernovae

[11–13]. In such a scenario, the electron conversion to muon is unlikely at low temperatures

or entropy, and the muon fraction was found much suppressed at S/A = 1 and 2. At high

temperatures of the PNS matter at S/A = 4, the electron chemical potential µe increases

and exceeds the muon threshold, and muons appear again.

In both cases, the eﬀect of the symmetry energy is clearly demonstrated: at high baryon

densities, the asy-stiﬀ interactions always give higher electron and proton fractions compared

with those given by the asy-soft interactions. Such an impact of the symmetry energy is

more pronounced in the ν-free case, where the electron fraction xe predicted by the asy-soft

models reduces signiﬁcantly to below 0.1 at high baryon densities. As discussed in Ref. [8],

the diﬀerence in the electron fraction caused by diﬀerent slopes of the symmetry energy

at high baryon densities has a drastic eﬀect on the ν-emission process during the cooling

of neutron star. Namely, in the soft symmetry-energy scenario, the direct Urca process is

strongly quenched because of Ye < 11% [8, 60], while it is well allowed in the stiﬀ symmetry-

energy scenario. The diﬀerence in the electron fraction caused by diﬀerent slopes of the

symmetry energy is less pronounced in very hot PNS matter at S/A = 4. Such state of hot

PNS matter has been shown to occur at the onset of collapse of a very massive (40 M⊙)

progenitor to black hole [9, 10].

It is interesting to note the diﬀerence between results obtained in the ν-trapped and ν-

free cases. Although β-equilibrium implies the weak processes l + p ↔ n + νl, in the ν-free

PNS matter most of neutrinos have escaped and cannot contribute to these processes, and

they proceed preferably in one direction (from left to right). As a result, the PNS matter

undergoes the neutronization process [1, 63]. Therefore, the ν-free PNS matter is always

more neutron-rich than the ν-trapped matter as shown above in Fig. 15. Finally we discuss

also the eﬀect of increasing temperature (or equivalently increasing entropy) on the particle

diﬀerence between the neutron and proton fractions (nn decreases while np increases with

T ). In a similar way, the diﬀerence between e and µ becomes also less pronounced with

the increasing temperature (ne decreases and nµ increases with T ). Such a phenomenon is

expected to occur between particles of similar nature, and the hot matter tends to quench

the diﬀerence in their masses. Although the impact of the symmetry energy in the presence

of trapped neutrinos was shown to be less signiﬁcant with increasing entropy, we found

that the symmetry energy still has some eﬀect on the neutrino fraction in the high-density

ν-trapped PNS matter at S/A = 4. Even with a ﬁxed electron lepton fraction Ye = 0.4,

the neutrino fraction xν < 10% was found with the asy-stiﬀ CDM3Y6 interaction as nb
approaches 1 fm−3, while xν close to 20% was found with the soft CDM3Y6s interaction

(see right panel of Fig. 21). The result given by the stiﬀ CDM3Y6 interaction seems to agree

well with those of the recent hydrodynamic simulation of black hole formation in the failed

core-collapse supernova [9], which suggested that the thermodynamic condition of hot β-

β-STABLE CONFIGURATION OF HOT PROTONEUTRON STAR

We used the total internal energy E and pressure P inside PNS at entropy per baryon

S/A = 1, 2 and 4 given by the diﬀerent EOS’s discussed above in Sec. III as inputs for the

Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations [6]. The β-stable hydrostatic conﬁguration

of hot PNS in diﬀerent scenarios given by the solutions of the TOV equations are presented

in Tables II and III, and Figs. 24-26. For comparison, we have also presented in these tables

the β-stable conﬁguration of cold (ν-free) neutron star, given by the solutions of the TOV

equations obtained with the same EOS’s [8].

by the nuclear symmetry energy to the stable conﬁguration of PNS, we have considered

solutions of the TOV equations given by the EOS’s based on the CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y6

interactions [39] and their soft versions CDM3Y3s and CDM3Y6s [8]. The only diﬀerence

between these two groups of the CDM3Yn interaction is the modeling of the IV density

dependence that gives diﬀerent slopes of the free symmetry energy at high NM densities

and diﬀerent temperatures as shown in Fig. 4. One can see in Tables II and Figs. 24 and

25 that in the ν-free case, the impact of the symmetry energy is quite strong at entropy

per baryon S/A = 0, 1 and 2. For example, the PNS maximum gravitational mass obtained

with the CDM3Y3s interaction at S/A = 1 is Mmax(CDM3Y3s) ≈ 1.18 M⊙, and it increases

to Mmax(CDM3Y3) ≈ 1.64 M⊙ when the density dependence of the symmetry energy is

changed from the soft to the stiﬀ behavior. Similarly with the CDM3Y6 interaction, we

found Mmax(CDM3Y6s) ≈ 1.65 M⊙ and Mmax(CDM3Y6) ≈ 1.97 M⊙ at S/A = 1 (see

Fig. 24). Thus, the diﬀerence in the slope of the symmetry energy at high NM densities

could lead to a diﬀerence of 0.3 − 0.5 M⊙ in the predicted Mmax value. We note further that

(upper panel) and its soft CDM3Y6s version [8] (lower panel). The circle at the end of each curve

indicates the last stable conﬁguration.

Mmax obtained with the CDM3Y6 interaction at S/A = 0, 1 is quite close to the neutron star

mass of 1.97 M⊙ observed recently by Demores et al. [58]. Because the isospin dependences

of the CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y6 interactions are nearly the same, the diﬀerence of about

0.3 M⊙ in the Mmax values at S/A = 0, 1 obtained with these two interactions in the ν-free

case should be due to diﬀerent nuclear incompressibilities K0 (see Table I). Concerning other

NN interactions under study, only the Sly4 and M3Y-P7 interactions give the Mmax values

at S/A = 0, 1 close to the observed neutron star mass of 1.97 M⊙ [58]. The D1N interaction

gives a too low Mmax ≈ 1.23 and 1.32 M⊙ at S/A = 0 and 1, respectively, while the M3Y-P5

interaction gives unstable results for the PNS conﬁguration at high temperatures and baryon

densities, and are not included in the present discussion. We note that the instability of the

results given by the M3Y-P5 interaction is purely numerical one that is likely due to the

parametrization of this version of M3Y-Pn interaction.

In the presence of trapped neutrinos, the eﬀect caused by diﬀerent slopes of the symmetry

energy is diminished already at entropy S/A = 1 and 2, and stable values of the maximum

mass and radius of PNS are rather close, independent of the behavior of the symmetry

energy (see Tables II, Figs. 24 and 25). We note that the microscopic BHF calculation of

the ν-trapped, isentropic PNS [12] gives the maximum mass Mmax ≈ 1.95 M⊙ at entropy

per baryon S/A = 1 and 2, and the corresponding Rmax ≈ 10.3 and 10.8 km. Thus, only

the PNS conﬁguration obtained with the CDM3Y6 interaction has the maximum mass close

to the BHF result, while the maximum radius is slightly larger than that predicted by the

BHF calculation.

At much higher temperatures of the PNS matter at S/A = 4, the impact of the symmetry

energy becomes weaker and similar β-stable conﬁgurations were found with both the asy-stiﬀ

and asy-soft interactions in both the ν-free and ν-trapped scenarios. However, the eﬀect of

the increasing entropy on the maximum gravitational mass and radius of the β-stable PNS

is very signiﬁcant, and we found a strong increase of Mmax and Rmax at entropy per baryon

S/A = 4 compared to those obtained at S/A = 0 (see Tables II and III, and Figs. 24-26).

The hot PNS at S/A = 4 is substantially expanded in its mass (∆Mmax ≈ 0.3 − 0.5 M⊙)

and size (∆Rmax ≈ 4 − 5 km), while the pressure in the core is decreased by a factor up to

three. The case of the D1N interaction is extreme with the diﬀerences ∆Mmax ≈ 1 M⊙ and

∆Rmax ≈ 6.5 km found between the cold neutron star and hot PNS at S/A = 4 (both being

in β-equilibrium without trapped neutrinos).

ference in temperature of hot PNS matter given by diﬀerent density dependent interactions

(shown in the last two columns of Tables II and III) is directly related to the diﬀerence in

nucleon eﬀective mass illustrated in Figs. 17-19. While the maximum gravitational masses

obtained with the D1N, M3Y-P7 and Sly4 interactions are only slightly larger than that

obtained with the CDM3Y6 interaction by ∆Mmax ≈ 0.1 M⊙, the diﬀerence in temperature

of PNS at entropy S/A = 4 is very large, up to about 100 MeV. The recent hydrodynamic

simulation of the gravitational collapse of a massive 40 M⊙ protoneutron progenitor to black

hole [9] has shown that the β-stable matter (with very small neutrino fraction) in the outer

core of PNS, is reaching S/A ≈ 4 at baryon density ρs ≈ 0.63 × 1015 g/cm3 and temperature

Ts ≈ 80 − 90 MeV, depending on the inputs of the EOS of β-stable PNS matter (see Fig. 16

of Ref. [9]). For the purpose of comparison, we have also deduced temperature of the PNS

layer of baryon density of around 0.63 × 1015 g/cm3 from out mean-ﬁeld results (see the

last column of Tables II and III), and found that only the CDM3Yn and D1N interactions

give temperature Ts in the ν-free scenario comparable with that obtained in the hydrody-

namic simulation. The temperature Tc in the center of β-stable hydrostatic PNS given by

the CDM3Yn interaction is about 90 and 110 MeV in the ν-trapped and ν-free scenarios,

respectively. The Tc values given by the D1N, M3Y-P7 and Sly4 interactions are much too

high (see Tables III), and this eﬀect is clearly due to the unrealistic behavior of nucleon

eﬀective mass predicted by these interactions at high baryon densities (see Figs. 17 and 18).

From the above discussion, only the asy-stiﬀ CDM3Yn interaction seems to reproduce the

conﬁguration of hot PNS comparable with that given by the hydrodynamic simulation.

We discuss our mean-ﬁeld results for the ν-free and β-stable PNS at S/A = 4 in more

details. Because the simulated density proﬁle of temperature reaches its maximum at the

total entropy per baryon S/A ≈ 4, the authors of Refs. [9, 10] have compared the stable

41

hydrostatic conﬁgurations obtained with diﬀerent EOS’s for the ν-free, β-stable PNS at

S/A = 4 with the results of their hydrodynamic simulation. What they found is quite

remarkable: the gravitational mass MG enclosed inside the shock at the onset of collapse

of the 40 M⊙ protoneutron progenitor to black hole (open squares in Fig. 27) given by

the simulation is rather close to the maximum gravitational mass Mmax given by the same

EOS of hot PNS matter (open circles in Fig. 27). As a result, almost a linear correlation

was found between the Mmax value and the delay time tBH from the onset of collapse until

black hole formation predicted by the simulation [9] (see the solid line in Fig. 27). We have

combined, therefore, the results of this interesting study from Refs. [9, 10], and presented the

correlation between tBH, MG and Mmax values in Fig. 27. Although the tBH and MG values

that might be obtained from the hydrodynamic simulation using the EOS’s considered in the

present work are still uncertain, we can use the correlation found between tBH and Mmax in

Refs. [9, 10] to roughly estimate tBH based on Mmax values given by the density dependent

NN interactions under study. Focusing on the CDM3Y6, Sly4, and M3Y-P7 interactions

which give the Mmax value at S/A = 0 close to the observed neutron star mass of around

1.97 M⊙ [58], we ﬁnd that tBH ≈ 0.5 s might be obtained with the EOS based on the

CDM3Y6 interaction, and tBH ≈ 0.6 − 0.7 s with the EOS’s based on the Sly4 and M3Y-

P7 interactions. These values seem to satisfy the realistic boundary condition tBH & 0.5 s

discussed in Ref. [9].

V. CONCLUSION

A consistent Hartree-Fock calculation of hot asymmetric NM has been performed using

several realistic choices of the in-medium density dependent NN interaction, which have

been successfully used in nuclear structure and reaction studies. The impact of nuclear

symmetry energy and nucleon eﬀective mass to thermal properties of asymmetric NM has

been studied in details. We found that the two groups of the interactions (the so-called

asy-stiﬀ and asy-soft) that give the stiﬀ and soft behaviors of the symmetry energy of NM

at zero temperature also give the same behaviors of the free symmetry energy of hot NM.

The free symmetry energy and nucleon eﬀective mass obtained with the asy-stiﬀ CDM3Y3

and CDM3Y6 interactions are in a good agreement with the prediction of the microscopic

BHF calculations [12, 52] using the Argonne NN interaction, while those results given by

42

the asy-soft interactions diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the BHF results at high NM densities.

We have tested the quadratic approximation for the dependence of the free symmetry

energy on the neutron-proton asymmetry δ by comparing the results of the HF calculation

at diﬀerent asymmetries δ. While this approximation remains reasonable for the internal

symmetry energy Esym/A at diﬀerent temperatures, it becomes much poorer for the free sym-

metry energy Fsym/A with the increasing temperature. Such a breakdown of the quadratic

approximation is due to the contribution of entropy. The HF calculation of hot NM has

been done in a ﬁne grid of the baryon number densities, neutron-proton asymmetries, tem-

peratures and entropies to investigate the density proﬁles of temperature and entropy of

hot NM. A very signiﬁcant impact of the nucleon eﬀective mass m∗ to the thermodynamic

properties of hot NM was found, which is directly related to the momentum dependence

of the nucleon mean-ﬁeld potential. At the given baryon density, the smaller the nucleon

eﬀective mass the larger the temperature of NM.

The density dependent NN interactions were further used to generate the EOS of baryon

matter in the uniform PNS core, which was smoothly connected to the EOS of the inhomo-

geneous PNS crust by Shen et al. [7, 55] for the mean-ﬁeld study of β-stable PNS matter

at ﬁnite temperature. Our study considered two diﬀerent scenarios: the ν-trapped matter

with the electron lepton fraction Ye ≈ 0.4 and the total entropy per baryon S/A = 1, 2

and 4, which mimics the initial stage of PNS; the ν-free matter at S/A = 1, 2 and 4, which

is close to the late stage of PNS when most neutrinos have escaped. The impact of nu-

clear symmetry energy was found signiﬁcant in the ν-free PNS matter where the dynamic

neutron-proton asymmetry, baryon and lepton compositions obtained with the asy-stiﬀ and

asy-soft interactions are quite diﬀerent. The high-density behaviors of the density proﬁles

of temperature and entropy of the ν-free, β-stable PNS matter are strongly aﬀected not

only by the symmetry energy but also by the nucleon eﬀective mass. Although the impact

of the symmetry energy was found less signiﬁcant in the presence of trapped neutrinos, we

found that the symmetry energy still aﬀects strongly the neutrino fraction in the ν-trapped

PNS matter, with xν . 0.1 given by the asy-stiﬀ interactions at high baryon densities, and

xν & 0.1 given by the asy-soft interactions.

Using the inputs of the TOV equation based on diﬀerent EOS’s, we obtained the β-stable

hydrostatic conﬁguration of PNS at the total entropy per baryon S/A = 1, 2 and 4 in both

the ν-free and ν-trapped scenarios. In the absence of trapped neutrinos, diﬀerent slopes of

43

the symmetry energy at high baryon densities were shown to give a diﬀerence of 0.3−0.5 M⊙

in the maximum gravitational mass Mmax predicted with the CDM3Yn interactions. For

the ν-trapped, β-stable PNS, the eﬀect of the symmetry energy is diminished already at

the entropy S/A = 1 and 2, and the stable values of the maximum gravitational mass and

radius of the PNS are rather close, independent of the behavior of the symmetry energy.

However, the impact of the nucleon eﬀective mass remains drastic in both ν-trapped and

ν-free cases, with temperature of the PNS matter being inversely proportional to m∗. In

particular, the diﬀerence in temperature in both the outer core and center of PNS given by

diﬀerent density dependent NN interactions at S/A = 4 is mainly due to the diﬀerence in

m∗ because the eﬀect of the symmetry energy is diminished at this high entropy

A special attention was given to the conﬁguration of the ν-free PNS at entropy S/A = 4,

which was shown by Hempel et al. [9] to occur at the onset of the collapse of a massive (40

M⊙) protoneutron progenitor to black hole. We found that at very high temperatures of PNS

matter at S/A = 4, the impact of the symmetry energy becomes weaker and the similar β-

stable conﬁgurations of PNS were obtained with both the asy-stiﬀ and asy-soft interactions.

The Mmax and Rmax values were found strongly increased at the entropy per baryon S/A = 4,

with the diﬀerence ∆Mmax ≈ 0.3 − 0.5 M⊙ and ∆Rmax ≈ 4 − 5 km compared to the results

obtained at S/A = 0. Thus, the hot PNS at S/A = 4 is substantially expanded in size, with

the decreased central pressure and density. In the outer core of hot PNS being at entropy

S/A = 4, only temperature given by the asy-stiﬀ CDM3Yn interaction is comparable to

that predicted by the hydrodynamic simulation. The maximum gravitational masses Mmax

obtained for the β-stable and ν-free PNS at S/A = 4 using diﬀerent EOS’s of hot NM were

used to estimate the time tBH of collapse of the 40 M⊙ progenitor to black hole, based on a

correlation found between tBH and Mmax from the hydrodynamic simulation [9, 10].

In a more general viewpoint, the present mean-ﬁeld study illustrates the large impact of

the nuclear symmetry energy and nucleon eﬀective mass in dense and hot baryon matter.

This eﬀect becomes more complicated after the inclusion of trapped neutrinos which weakens

the correlation of the thermodynamic properties of PNS with the symmetry energy. The

densities and temperatures reached in the core of PNS at entropy of S/A ≈ 4 or higher

might imply a phase transition to new degrees of freedom as discussed, e.g., in Refs. [62, 63].

Thus, PNS is the most extreme compact object which requires the most advanced knowledge

in the nuclear and QCD physics. It is, however, very short-lived because it lasts only a few

44

minutes before being collapsed to black hole or cooled down to neutron star. Thus, the

observation of the next supernova explosion in our galaxy will certainly provide the new and

fascinating information about the hot PNS matter that is extremely diﬃcult to obtain in

the terrestrial nuclear physics laboratories.

Appendix A: Explicit HF expressions obtained with the ﬁnite-range CDM3Yn,

M3Y-Pn, and Gogny interactions

For the interested readers who might want to reconstruct various nuclear EOS’s used in

the present mean-ﬁeld study, we give in this appendix the explicit presentation of the density

dependent NN interactions used in the HF calculation of NM. In general, the (central) NN

interaction can be given in terms of the spin- and isospin dependent, direct (D) and exchange

(EX) components as

vD(EX)(r) = vD(EX)

00

(r) + vD(EX)

10

(r)σ1 · σ2 + vD(EX)

01

(r)τ1 · τ2 + vD(EX)

11

(r)(σ1 · σ2)(τ1 · τ2), (A1)

where σ and τ are the Pauli spin and isospin operators, respectively. Except of the Sly4

interaction, the CDM3Yn, M3Y-Pn, and Gogny interactions are of ﬁnite-range. For the

spin-saturated NM, only the spin-independent (v00 and v01) components of the central NN

interaction are needed in the HF calculation of NM, because the contributions of the spin-

dependent terms in Eq. (A1) to the NM energy are averaged out.

Thus, the density dependent CDM3Yn interaction was used in the present HF calculation

explicitly as

vD(EX)(nb, r) = F0(nb)vD(EX)

00

(r) + F1(nb)vD(EX)

01

(r)τ1 · τ2, where r = |r1 − r2|.

(A2)

The radial parts vD(EX)

00(01) (r) are kept unchanged as determined from the M3Y-Paris interaction

[21], in terms of three Yukawas

vD(EX)
00(01) (r) =

3

Xk=1

Y D(EX)
00(01) (k)

exp(−akr)

akr

.

(A3)

The density dependence of the CDM3Yn interaction (A2) was assumed to have the same

functional form as that introduced ﬁrst in Ref. [23]

F0(1)(nb) = C0(1)[1 + α0(1) exp(−β0(1)nb) + γ0(1)nb].

(A4)

The parameters of the IS density dependence F0(nb) were determined [23] to reproduce the

saturation properties of symmetric NM and give the nuclear incompressibility K = 218 and

252 MeV with the CDM3Y3 and CDM3Y6 versions, respectively. The parameters of the IV

density dependence F1(nb) were determined [39] to consistently reproduce the BHF results

for the nucleon OP in asymmetric NM [48, 49] in the HF calculation as well as the measured

48

charge-exchange (p, n) and (3He,t) data for the isobar analog states in the folding model

(coupled-channel) analysis [24, 47]. The ranges and strengths of Yukawa functions and

parameters of the density dependence F0(1)(nb) are given in Tables IV and V, respectively.

For the soft version CDM3Yns of the CDM3Yn interaction, the IV density dependence was

assumed in the same functional form as that of the IS density dependence, with the strength

slightly scaled, F1(nb) ≈ 1.1F0(nb), to obtain the same symmetry energy εsym ≈ 32 MeV at

the saturation density n0 in the HF calculation [8, 22].

As variance with the CDM3Yn interaction, the density dependence of the M3Y-Pn and

Gogny interactions are introduced via a zero-range density dependent term

vD(EX)
00(01) (nb, r) = vD(EX)

00(01) (r) + dD(EX)

00(01) (nb, r).

(A5)

The ﬁrst term of the M3Y-Pn interaction (A5) has the same ﬁnite-range form as that given in

Eq. (A3), with the Yukawa ranges and strengths given in Table IV. The direct and exchange

parts of the density dependent term d00(01)(nb, r) of the M3Y-Pn interaction are the same

and can be given explicitly in terms of single-even (SE) and triplet-even (TE) components

of the two-nucleon force as

dD
00(nb, r) = dEX

00 (nb, r) =

dD
01(nb, r) = dEX

01 (nb, r) =

1/3(cid:1) δ(r),

(A6)

with tSE = 830 MeV fm6 and tTE = 1478 MeV fm4 adopted for the M3Y-P7 version [28].

The ﬁnite-range part of Gogny interaction is similar to that of the M3Y-Pn interaction,

but with the radial dependence parametrized in terms of two Gaussians

where Gaussian ranges and strengths used with the D1N version are given in Table IV. The

direct and exchange parts of the density dependent term d00(01)(nb, r) of Gogny interaction

can be explicitly given as

Dividing the total energy density (1) of NM over the corresponding baryon number density

nb, one obtains the internal NM energy per particle with the CDM3Yn, M3Y-Pn, and Gogny

interactions as

E

(T, nb, δ) = Ekin(T, nb, δ) + Epot(T, nb, δ),

(A9)

(A10)

It is noteworthy that at ﬁnite temperature the kinetic energy term is aﬀected by diﬀerent

EOS’s via the single-particle potential embedded in the nucleon momentum distribution

nτ (k, T ). The direct term of the (isoscalar and isovector) potential energy is obtained

compactly with the CDM3Yn interaction as

Here nb(k, T ) = nn(k, T ) + np(k, T ), ∆nb(k, T ) = nn(k, T ) − np(k, T ), and

Note that the direct term of the potential energy is the same as that obtained at zero

temperature [8, 22], and the explicit temperature dependence is embedded entirely in the

exchange (Fock) term. Thus, a proper treatment of Pauli blocking in the mean-ﬁeld studies

of hot NM is indeed very important.

The exchange term of the potential energy given by the ﬁnite-range, density independent

part of the M3Y-Pn and Gogny interactions can be obtained in the same expression (A12),

but with F0(1)(nb) = 1. It is convenient to include the contribution from the zero-range,

density dependent part of these interactions into the direct term of the potential energy

in terms of the IS and IV parts as

One can see that the explicit temperature dependence of single-particle potential is entirely

embedded in the exchange terms of U (HF) and U (RT). Moreover, the explicit momentum

dependence of single-particle potential (needed for the estimation of the nucleon eﬀective

mass) is also contained in the exchange term of the HF potential (A20) only. All this

indicates the vital role of Pauli blocking in dense NM.

The exchange term of the HF potential given by the ﬁnite-range, density independent

part of the M3Y-Pn and Gogny interactions can be obtained in the same expression (A20),

but with F0(1)(nb) = 1. It is also convenient to include the contribution from the zero-range

(density dependent) part of these interactions into the direct part of the HF potential as

where j1(x) is the ﬁrst-order spherical Bessel function, and the + sign pertains to neutron

and - to proton. The nucleon eﬀective mass in hot NM given by the M3Y-Pn and Gogny

interactions can be obtained in the same expression (A25), but with F0(1)(nb) = 1. We

emphasize again that the nuclear medium modiﬁcation responsible for the nucleon eﬀective

mass is fully given by the exchange (Fock) term of single-particle potential.

Appendix B: Explicit HF expressions obtained with the zero-range Skyrme inter-

action

The central zero-range Skyrme interaction [31, 32] has been used in the present HF

calculation explicitly as

exchange operator in Eq. (B1) is taken as Pσ = −Pτ Pr, where Pτ and Pr apply the exchange

of isospins (τ1 ⇄ τ2) and spacial coordinates (r1 ⇄ r2), respectively.

interaction as

(B2)

Due to the zero range of Skyrme interaction, the temperature dependence implied by the

nucleon momentum distribution is integrated out and the potential energy term in Eq. (B2)

turns out to be the same as that at zero temperature. As a result, the temperature depen-

dence of the internal NM energy is entirely embedded in the kinetic energy term (B3), where

the (temperature independent) nucleon eﬀective mass m∗

τ is determined as

Like the potential energy term in Eq. (B2), the temperature dependence of single particle

potential is also given by that of the kinetic energy term, via Kτ (T ) values. With the explicit

momentum dependence of Skyrme interaction (B1), the HF term of single-particle potential

(B5) has a quadratic momentum dependence that gives the nucleon eﬀective mass (B4).

Like the case of M3Y-Pn and Gogny interactions, the rearrangement term (B6) of Skyrme

single-particle potential is also temperature independent.

The explicit parameters of the SLy4 version [32] of Skyrme interaction used in the present

HF calculation are:

t0=-2488.91 MeV fm3, t1=486.82 MeV fm5, t2=-546.39 MeV fm5,

t3=13777.0 MeV fm3+3γ, x0=0.834, x1=-0.344, x2 =-1.000, x3=1.354, and γ = 1/6.
