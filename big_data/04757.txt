(Dated: March 16, 2016)

Direct laser acceleration of electrons in ion channels is investigated in a general case when the laser
phase velocity is greater than (or equal to) the speed of light. Using the similarity of the equations of
motion for ultra-relativistic electrons, we develop a universal scaling theory that gives the maximum
possible energy that can be attained by an electron for given laser and plasma parameters. The
theory predicts appearance of forbidden zones in the phase space of the particle, which manifests
itself as an energy gain threshold. We apply the developed theory to ﬁnd the conditions needed for an
energy enhancement via a resonant interaction between the third harmonic of betatron oscillations
and the laser wave. The theory is also used to analyze electron dynamics in a circularly polarized
laser.

INTRODUCTION

High intensity laser beams propagating in an under-
dense plasma expel ambient plasma electrons radially
and create a zone fully or partially evacuated of electrons.
Short beams generate a structure, known as a plasma
bubble, that follows in the wake of the laser pulse [1],
whereas long beams create slowly evolving quasistatic
ion channels [2]. In the bubble regime, there is a strong
longitudinal electric ﬁeld that can accelerate electrons
to very high energies while a transverse electromagnetic
ﬁeld keeps electrons close to the bubble axis [3–6]. If a
second laser pulse is placed close to the bottom of the
plasma bubble, then the electrons can undergo direct
laser acceleration (DLA) in this pulse and gain signiﬁcant
energy [7, 8]. In the ion channel regime, the longitudinal
ﬁeld is usually weak and electrons are accelerated only by
the laser. This regime is interesting for applications that
require a large number of energetic electrons. Speciﬁ-
cally, generation of copious relativistic electrons is the
key to x-ray [9, 10] and secondary particle sources, such
as energetic ions [12], neutrons [11], and positrons [13].

Direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons in ion
channels and plasma bubbles has been considered ana-
lytically and through extensive computational work [7, 8,
14, 15]. Recently it has been shown that due to paramet-
ric instability [16, 17] the electron trajectory can become
essentially a three dimensional curve even when electrons
are injected in the plane formed by the channel axes and
the laser polarization [18].

Transverse electric ﬁelds of the channel can signiﬁ-
cantly alter electron oscillations across the channel dur-
ing direct laser acceleration. This can allow for a res-
onant interaction where the electron transverse velocity
remains anti-parallel to the laser electric ﬁeld over ex-
tended segments of the electron trajectory. During the
resonant interaction, the electron can gain signiﬁcant en-
ergy from the laser electric ﬁeld, which is then converted
into the longitudinal motion by the laser magnetic ﬁeld.
Distinctive feature of the resonant interaction of electrons
with high intensity laser wave is that the Doppler-shifted
frequency of the wave can oscillate from almost zero to

its maximum value while the betatron frequency of trans-
verse electron oscillations experiences relatively slow vari-
ations [19]. Such a nontrivial resonant interaction com-
plicates the electron dynamics and makes the speciﬁcs of
interaction mechanism unclear.

In this paper we develop an analytical description of
the acceleration of electrons by linearly polarized laser
wave in ion channels and obtain the universal scalings
for the maximum electron energy. The paper is orga-
nized as follows. In Sec. II, we discuss the paraxial ap-
proximation of equations of motion for electrons acceler-
ated by the laser wave and show that in dimensionless
variables these equations depend only on two parame-
ters. In Sec. III, we develop main components of univer-
sal scalings theory for the luminal laser wave: averaging
equations of motion over betatron oscillations [20, 21],
ﬁnding their analytical solution, and explaining how ap-
pearance of the forbidden zones in the phase space results
in thresholds in dependence of maximum electron energy
on the laser-plasma parameters. In Sec. IV, the similar
consideration is developed for super-luminal laser wave.
Then in Sec. V, we consider several spinoﬀs of the univer-
sal scalings theory: (A) acceleration of electrons through
the resonance between the wave and the third harmonic
of betatron oscillations, (B) acceleration of electrons by
the circularly polarized laser wave, and (C) acceleration
of pre-accelerated electrons. Finally, we summarized and
discussed the obtained results in Sec. VI.

II. ELECTRON MOTION IN THE PARAXIAL

APPROXIMATION

We examine electron dynamics in the framework of a
model that incorporates a laser beam propagating along
the axis of a uniform cylindrical ion channel and a fo-
cusing electrostatic ﬁeld created by the channel ions.
The ﬁelds of the planar linearly polarized laser pulse
are E(L)
c/vph where φ =
ωL(x/vph− t) is the wave phase, E0 = a0(mωLc/e) is the
amplitude of the laser electric ﬁeld. The electrostatic
ﬁeld created by the channel ions is approximated by

y = E0 cos φ and B(L)

tive charge, and m is the electron mass and subscript ’⊥’
denotes the vector components transverse to the channel
axis. The equations of motion are then given by

The electron dynamics in the ion channel is determined
to a large extent by two frequencies pertinent to Eqs. (1)
- (3): the frequency of natural oscillations of the elec-
tron across the channel (betatron frequency) and the fre-
quency of the oscillating laser ﬁelds experienced by the
moving electron (Doppler shifted frequency):

ωβ = ωp/(2γ)1/2,
ωD = ωL(1 − vx/vph).

It is well known [22] that when a relativistic intensity
electromagnetic wave (with a0 (cid:29) 1) accelerates electrons
in vacuum, the typical value of the electron momentum
is px ∼ meca2
0/2 (cid:29) py ∼ mca0 (cid:29) mc, so that γ ≈ pxc.
Similarly, we expect for the energy of ultra-relativistic
electrons accelerated in the ion channel to be primar-
ily associated with the momentum in the direction of
the wave propagation. Under the paraxial approxima-
tion (px >> |p⊥| >> mec), equations (3) reduce to

The integral of motion in dimensionless variables takes

(15)

Initially sub-relativistic electrons perform irregular os-
cillations and their dynamics is determined by several pa-
rameters ωp. However, once the electron energy becomes
ultra-relativistic, the electron motion can be described by
the the paraxial approximation (11) and (12) which con-
tains only two parameters E and χ. Since electrons gain
most of their energy during this stage, it raises the ques-
tion in what extent the electron dynamics is determined
by these parameters.

In all examples below we assume for simplicity that
initially electrons are placed at rest on the axis of the
channel, so that the only diﬀerence in their initial con-
ditions is the logitudinal location given by x or, equiva-
lently, by the wave phase φ. Figure 1 shows the result of
integration of exact equations of motion (1) - (3) for two
electrons accelerated by the laser in the ion channel with
the same parameters E = 0.2 and χ = 0 but with diﬀer-
ent a0 and ωp/ωL. In both cases, the electrons initially
perform irregular oscillations and then they gain a large
energy following somewhat similar peaks, see Fig. 1 (a).
The peaks with the largest energy gain can diﬀer in de-
tails but always exhibit a general similarity. Figure 1 (b)
shows that in the luminal case the amplitude of betatron
oscillations is constant and equal to r∗ once the electrons
have gained ultra-relativistic energies.

of the electron trajectory. Therefore, the phase shift be-
tween the phase of the laser wave and the phase of the
transverse oscillations, θ = ψ + φ, is an important char-
acteristic of the laser-particle interaction. Combining the
expressions for ˙ψ and ˙φ, we obtain:

˜p1/2

To make clearer the physical meaning of the terms in
the right hand side of this equation we rewrite it in the
following equivalent form: (cid:104) ˙θ(cid:105) = (ωβ − (cid:104)ωD(cid:105))/ω∗ where
ωβ = ωp/(2px/mc)1/2 and (cid:104)ωD(cid:105) = ωLI0/(2px/mc). Note
that ωβ = (cid:104)ωD(cid:105) = ω∗ at px = p∗.

The longitudinal component of the Lorentz force that
determines the evolution of ˜px involves an oscillating fac-
tor cos ψ cos φ. Near the resonance, ωβ ≈ (cid:104)ωD(cid:105), we can
can use an approximation (cid:104)cos ψ cos φ(cid:105) ≈ α cos(cid:104)θ(cid:105), where
α ≈ 0.348, see Appendix and Ref.[]. After averaging out
the betatron oscillations, the ﬁrst equation in (11) re-
duces to

˙˜px = −4αE cos(cid:104)θ(cid:105)/˜p1/2

and a0 = 10 (p∗ = 1250 and ω∗ = ωL/2500).

III. SCALINGS IN THE LUMINAL CASE

In this section we evaluate the maximum energy that
can be gained from the laser at given laser and plasma
parameters. We show that small changes of the parame-
ter E can result in dramatic changes in the electron mo-
tion. Speciﬁcally, this aspect manifests itself as threshold
dependence of the maximum energy gain on the laser am-
plitude.

A. Analytical theory

In the paraxial approximation the dimensionless am-
plitude of oscillations is equal to unity and thus it is
convenient to introduce a phase of betatron oscillations
ψ, such that ˜y = sin ψ. Using this relashionship, we
immediately ﬁnd from Eq. (15) by setting χ = 0 that
˙˜y = cos ψ/˜p1/2
x . The latter expression
relates the change of the phase of transverse oscillations
to the betatron frequency ˙ψ = ωβ/ω∗ [see Eq. (4)].

and ˙ψ = 1/˜p1/2

x

To make further progress, we utilize the other impor-
tant feature evident from Fig. 1, namely, that the par-
ticles perform several (and in some cases many) beta-
tron oscillations while gaining their energy. Averaging
out these oscillations signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the descrip-
tion of the ultra-relativistic motion []. Equation (12) for
the wave phase then reduces to (cid:104) ˙φ(cid:105) = −2(cid:104) ˙˜y2(cid:105) ≈ −1/˜px,
where the angle brackets denote averaging over the be-
tatron period. Here we have neglected the diﬀerence be-
tween (cid:104)˜px(cid:105) and ˜px because of the slow change of the lon-
gitudinal momentum during the energy gain.

As already pointed out, an eﬀective energy gain re-
quires for the electron transverse velocity to remain anti-
parallel to the laser electric ﬁeld over extended segments

(a) (b) ω*t  px /p* (a) px /p*  forbidden zone (b) where C is an integration constant determined by elec-
tron initial conditions.

We can now determine the maximum longitudinal mo-
mentum that can be achieved by an electron that is ini-
tially at rest. The function H increases with ˜px for ˜px ≤ 1
and then monotonically decreases for ˜px > 1. Since sin θ
cannot exceed 1, then having sin θ = 1 at ˜px = 1 allows
the electron to reach the maximum possible momentum
moving along a trajectory described by Eq. (18) in the
(˜px, θ)-phase space. Examples of such trajectories are
shown in Fig. 2(a). The momentum increases until sin θ
becomes equal to −1. This gives us the following condi-
tion for determining the maximum momentum ˜pmax:

4αE H(˜px)| ˜px=1 − 1

4αE H(˜px)| ˜px= ˜pmax = 2

(20)

8αE)2.

which readily yields ˜pmax = (1 +
The trajectories in Fig. 2(a) are plotted for three diﬀer-
ent values of E = 0.2, E = 0.36, and E = 0.54 and they il-
lustrate an important topological change that takes place
in the momentum space with the increase of this param-
eter. At E = 0.2, the electron momentum never reaches
zero, whereas, at E ≥ 0.36, the minimum electron mo-
mentum is zero. Using the quadratic equation (20) we
can ﬁnd the critical value Ecr that corresponds to this
transition: Ecr = 1/(8α) = 0.36. Also it follows from
this equation that for E ≤ Ecr the minimum momen-
tum is ˜pmin = (1 − √
8αE)2. Therefore, we arrive to
an important conclusion that initially cold electrons can
achieve ˜pmax only at E ≥ Ecr. Electrons must be pre-
heated at E < Ecr in order to achieve ˜pmax determined
from Eq. (20).

This observation raises a question of how an initially
cold electron would move in the (˜px, θ)-phase space at
E < Ecr. Such an electron starts its motion at ˜px = 0 with
a given initial phase θin that determines the integration
constant in Eq. (19), C = sin θin. The highest value
of the longitudinal momentum, ˜px = [1 − (1 − 4(1 −
sin θin)αE)1/2]2, is reached at θ = 1. Therefore, for a
given initial phase θin, the longitudinal momentum of
an initially cold electron would always oscillate in the
interval 0 < ˜px < ˜psub ≡ [1 − (1 − E/Ecr)1/2]2 < 1. An
example of such a trajectory is shown in Fig. 2(b) as a left
part of the solid curve. It is worth pointing out that if we
formally allow ˜px to increase in Eq. (19), then eventually
at ˜px > 1 the right-hand side of this equation would
again become smaller than unity. This would correspond
to a solution also shown in Fig. 2(b) with a right part
of the solid curve. In this case, the electron longitudinal
momentum oscillates while remaining greater than 1.
The example shown in Fig. 2(b), clearly illustrates that
at E < Ecr there appears a forbidden zone for an initially
cold electron where formally sin θ > 1. This zone can-
not be crossed by initially cold electrons, see Fig. 2 (b),
which perform only small amplitude oscillations along
the left part of the phase trajectory which ends at the
point (˜px, sin θ) = (˜psub, 1). The presence of the forbid-
den zone leads to a threshold dependence of ˜pmax on the

parameter E. Indeed, as we have already shown, we have

B. Results of numerical analysis

In order to verify the predictions of Sec. III A obtained
in the paraxial approximation by averaging out betatron
oscillations, we have solved numerically the exact equa-
tions of motion (1) - (3) for initially cold electrons and a
wide range of laser and plasma parameters. The numer-
ical solutions conﬁrm that indeed the phase trajectories
obtained from the exact equations of motion are close
to the averaged trajectories even at a small number of
betatron oscillations, see Fig 3(a) and 3(b). The numer-
ical solutions also conﬁrm that all electron trajectories
in the (px, θ)-phase space can be divided into two dis-
tinct groups described in the previous section depending
on the value of E. For the ﬁrst group of trajectories,
the momentum px oscillates while remaining below p∗,
while, for the second group of trajectories, the momen-
tum px can increase dramatically along the phase trajec-
tories and becomes well above p∗. The numerically cal-
culated critical value of E that separates the two groups
is E (num) = 0.54. This value is somewhat above than
what was predicted by our theory. One of the reasons for
this is that the paraxial approximation is only applica-
ble at ultra-relativistic energies and that is why an exact
solution is needed to quantitatively predict the threshold
value of E. Figure 4(a) illustrates a signiﬁcant change in
the energy gain at values of E close to Ecr.

We have repeated the numerical analysis for diﬀerent
initial positions of the electron. As previously stated, by
varying the initial longitudinal location x, we eﬀectively
vary the initial phase φ of the wave.
In this case the
parameter E remains the same. However, the change
in the initial phase φ can have a profound impact on
the electron dynamics in the ion channel. Figure 4(b)
shows the maximum relativistic γ-factor attained by an
electron as a function of E for two diﬀerent initial phases.
In the ﬁrst case, the electron begins its motion at φ =
0, so that initially E = E0 and a = 0.
In the second
case, the electron begins its motion at φ = π/2, so that
initially E = 0 and a = a0. We ﬁnd that the position of
the threshold changes signiﬁcantly with the initial phase.
For comparison, we have also plotted in this ﬁgure the
maximum energy gain obtained from Eq. (20) which is
transformed to the following convenient form:

gives an ampliﬁcation coeﬃcient of the electron energy
introduced by the ion channel.

In order to understand the underlying cause for the
threshold change, it is worth considering a simple case of
an electron in a vacuum. The momentum components in
this case are py = a− ain and px = p2
y/2, where ain is the
initial amplitude of the vector potential a determined by
the initial phase φ. Therefore, the maximum amplitude
of the px-oscillations induced by the wave increases from
0/2 at ain = 0 to four times this value at ain = −a0.
a2
The change in phase can then be viewed as electron pre-
heating that was discussed in the previous section.
In
other words, having stronger oscillations of px allows the
electron to access those averaged trajectories for which
pmin > 0. Diﬀerent initial wave phases can be realized,
for example, when electrons are injected in the channel
through ionization of the doping gas.

Additional numerical calculations show that the es-
timate given by Eq. (22) provides an accurate upper
limit for the electron energy gain regardless of the ini-
tial wave phase.
It remains accurate even when the
number of oscillation during the energy gain is not very
large. We ﬁnd that the number of transverse oscilla-
tion during the energy gain can be relatively well ap-
proximated by Nc ∼ 1.7E−1/2. The corresponding longi-
tudinal distance travelled by the electron is then given
by D ∼ c(2π/ω∗)Nc ∼ 1.7E−1/2I0(ωL/ωp)2λ, where
λ = cπ/ωL.

We have so far considered the case in which electrons
start their motion on the axis of the channel, so that the
resulting electron trajectories driven by the laser ﬁeld are
ﬂat. An initial displacement out of the plane of the driven
oscillations leads to a three-dimensional electron trajec-
tory []. Solving Eqs. (1) - (3) numerically in this regime,
we found that the maximum electron energy gain is close
to that predicted for the planar trajectories. During the

energy gain, the electron trajectory in the cross-section of
the channel resembles an ellipse considerably elongated
along the laser electric ﬁeld.

IV. SCALINGS IN THE SUPER-LUMINAL

CASE

In the luminal case vph = c considered in Sec. III, the
longitudinal velocity of ultrarelativistic electrons is sep-
arated on average from the speed of light by c − (cid:104)vx(cid:105) =
(cid:104)ωD/ωL(cid:105)c ∼ c/p∗ ∼ (ωp/ωL)2c. When electrons are ac-
celerated by the super-luminal wave, this diﬀerence can
be comparable to vph−c ∼ χ(ωp/ωL)2c, and therefore one
can expect a strong inﬂuence of super-luminosity on the
resonant interaction between electrons and the wave [].

In what follows, we use an approach developed in the
previous section in order to ﬁnd how the phase shift be-
tween a super-luminal wave and transverse electron os-
cillations in the channel evolves with time. In the super-
luminal case (χ > 0), the energy of the transverse oscil-
lations grows with the longitudinal electron momentum
according to Eq. (8). The amplitude of these oscillations
also grows with ˜px as ˜y = (1 + χ˜px)1/2 sin ψ. Under an
assumption that ˜px increases over many betatron oscil-
lations, we ﬁnd that the transverse velocity in the super-
luminal case is determined by ˙˜y ≈ (1 + χ˜px)1/2 cos ψ ˙ψ,
where ˙ψ = 1/˜p1/2
x . After averaging over betatron os-
cillations, Eq. (12) for the wave phase takes the form:
(cid:104) ˙φ(cid:105) = −2(cid:104) ˙˜y2(cid:105)− 2χ = −1/˜px− 3χ. Combining the expres-
sions for (cid:104) ˙φ(cid:105) and ˙ψ we then ﬁnd that the averaged phase

FIG. 6: Color-coded upper limit for maximum energy as
a function of E and χ. The energy area below dashed line
is reachable only for initially preheated electrons (that is, at
φ|t=0 = π/2). The area right of the black solid line cor-
responds to the range of laser-plasma parameters at which
[H(χ, χ˜p−) − H(χ, χ˜p+)]/4αE ≤ 2.2.

It is important to note that at small χ the second res-
onance occurs at much larger values of the longitudinal
momentum, ˜p+ ∝ χ−2 (cid:29) 1, than in the luminal case. As
a result, the super-luminosity enables a considerable en-
ergy increase compared to the luminal case. Figure 5 (b),
where maximum px exceeds p∗ by a factor more than 60,
illustrates this aspect.

As evident from Eqs. (26) and (27), the maximum lon-
gitudinal momentum now depends on two parameters,
˜pmax = ˜pmax(χ, αE). An upper limit for the electron en-
ergy gain is then given by

where γ∗ ≡ a2
0/2I0. We have evaluated γmax/γ∗ numer-
ically by performing a wide parameter scan, with the
result of the scan shown in Fig. 6. The dashed lines
marks an energy gain threshold, dividing the parameter-
space (χ,E) into two distinct areas. For parameters
above the dashed line, electrons gain the same maxi-
mum energy with and without initial preheating (that
is, at φ|t=0 = p/2 and at φ|t=0 = 0). For parameters
below the dashed line, only initially preheated electrons
(φ|t=0 = p/2) gain the energy given by Eq. (28), whereas
initially cold electrons (φ|t=0 = 0) gain considerably less
energy. This threshold matches at χ = 0 the threshold
discussed in Sec. IIIA for the luminal case.

The vertical solid curve in Fig. 6 marks a threshold in-
troduced by the super-luminosity of the wave. As shown
in Fig. 5 (a), the function H(χ, χ˜px) that determines the
time evolution of the phase shift θ can have a minimum in
addition to a maximum that is also present in the luminal
case. This minimum is accessible to an electron during
its acceleration as ˜px continues to increase, but only if
the diﬀerence between the maximum and the minimum
is not too large,

[H(χ, χ˜p−) − H(χ, χ˜p+)]/4αE ≤ 2.

(29)

A detailed numerical analysis shows that the constant on
the right-hand side of this inequality is 2.2 rather than 2.

In the luminal case, we have ωβ ∝ 1/˜p1/2

The analysis presented here demonstrates that super-
luminosity can have a positive impact on electron energy
gain during electron acceleration in an ion channel. Eﬀec-
tive energy gain requires for the betatron frequency ωβ
to remain close to the Doppler shifted frequency (cid:104)ωD(cid:105)
with the increase of the electron’s longitudinal momen-
tum.
and
(cid:104)ωD(cid:105) ∝ 1/˜p, that is, the Doppler shifted frequency de-
creases with the longitudinal momentum faster than the
betatron frequency. This eventually leads to a break-
down of the resonance condition and stems the longitu-
dinal momentum gain. The superluminal correction does
not change the betatron frequency, but it does increases
the Doppler shifted frequency: (cid:104)ωD(cid:105) ∝ (1/˜px + 3χ). As a
result, accelerating electrons can stay in resonance with
the laser wave at higher values of the longitudinal mo-
mentum and thus gain signiﬁcantly more energy than in
the luminal case.

x

We have found that three dimensional eﬀects in the
superluminal case are similar to those in the luminal case:
the particle pushed out of the plane formed by the laser
polarization and the channel axis moves along a three
dimensional trajectory and its maximum energy is the
same as during planar motion. We also have observed
the situations when large deviations from the plane can
sharply decrease the particle energy gain.

V. SPINOFFS OF UNIVERSAL SCALING

THEORY

The developed approach is quite general and therefore
it can be applied to examine several seemingly diﬀerent
regimes that we discuss in this section.

A. Acceleration of electrons through the resonance

with the third harmonic of betatron oscillations

In the previous section, we considered electron accel-
eration and the resulting energy gain when the Doppler
shifted frequency of the laser wave is close to the average
frequency of betatron oscillations. However, eﬃcient en-
ergy gain is also possible through a resonance of higher
harmonics, with |(cid:104)ωD(cid:105)| ≈ lωβ, where l is the number of
the betatron harmonic.

In order to describe such a regime, one needs to intro-
duce only several changes. Equation (23) for the averaged
phase shift, (cid:104)θ(l)(cid:105) = lψ+(cid:104)φ(cid:105), now takes the following form

(cid:104) ˙θ(l)(cid:105) =

lωβ − (cid:104)ωD(cid:105)

(0.06, 0.18) and (χ(3),E (3)) = (0.54, 0.128); ω(1)∗ ≈ 0.0195ωL,
p(1)∗ ≈ 178mec and ω(3)∗ ≈ 0.088ωL, p(3)∗ /32 ≈ 39mec.

Phase trajectories for the l = 1 (brown) and l = 3 reso-
nances (blue) at the same (χ(1),E (1)) and (χ(3),E (3)) as in
(a). Dashed blue line corresponds to averaged phase trajec-
tory. In all cases, electrons are initially placed at rest on the
channel cases.

After averaging the oscillating factor ˙˜y cos φ in Eq. (7),
we ﬁnd that (cid:104)cos ψ cos φ(cid:105) ≈ αl cos(cid:104)θ(cid:105) near an lth har-
monic resonance. The numerical constant αl is non van-
ishing only for odd values of l [], with α1 = 0.348101,
α3 = −0.162924, and α5 = 0.114729. Therefore, the lon-
gitudinal momentum ˜px now satisﬁes Eq. (24), where α
must be replaced with αl.

After straightforward transformations, we obtain an

equation for the electron phase trajectory:

sin(cid:104)θ(l)(cid:105) =

1

4αllE (l)

H[χ(l)/l2, (χ(l)/l2)(˜pxl2)] + C, (31)

where H is deﬁned by Eq. (27). By comparing Eq.
(31) to Eq. (26) that was derived for the main reso-
nance, we can immediately conclude that an lth har-
monic resonance is equivalent to the main resonance with
E = (|αl|/α)lE (l) and χ = χ(l)/l2. Therefore, the maxi-
mum energy for an lth harmonic resonance is given by

(32)

To illustrate the similarity between the main and the
3-harmonic resonances, we take (χ,E) ≡ (χ(1),E (1)) =
(0.06, 0.18) for the main resonance, which corresponds
to pmax(χ,E) ≈ 6.6 according to the parameter scan
shown in Fig. 6. The matching parameters for the
third-harmonic resonance are (χ(3),E (3)) = (0.06 ·
32, 0.18α/3|α3|) ≈ (0.54, 0.128). For these parameters,
pmax is the same as for the main resonance. Assum-
ing that in both cases the electrons are initially placed

(that is, with

ﬁnd that ω(1)

p(1)∗ = 178 for the main resonance and ω(3)

v(3)
ph /c = 1.0107, and p(3)∗ /32 = 39 for the third harmonic
resonance.

p /ωL = 0.3695, v(1)

Although the overall normalized momentum gain is
similar for the main and the third-harmonics resonance,
see Fig. 7(a), px(t) has a typical zig-zag signature in the
case of the third harmonic resonance, whereas px(t) has
smaller and smoother oscillations in the case of the main
resonance. Electron phase-space trajectories shown in
Fig. 7(b) for these two regimes also have distinctive sig-
natures: the trajectory for the third harmonic resonance
has large loop-like oscillations as compared to the trajec-
tory for the main resonance.

In general, ﬁgure 6 provides universal scalings for the
electron energy gain via high harmonic resonances. How-
ever, the realization of these regimes depends on initial
conditions (such as pre-acceleration) for given laser and
plasma parameters.

B. Acceleration of electrons by the circularly

polarized laser wave

The other application of the universal scaling theory is
the electron motion in a circular polarized (CP) laser
wave. To be speciﬁc, we set E(L) = E0c(ey cos φ +
ez sin φ) and B(L) = E0c(c/vph)(−ey sin φ + ez cos φ),
where φ is the wave phase and E0c = acmeωLc/e is the
wave amplitude. The integration of exact equation of
motion shows that, when this wave accelerates electrons
in the ion channel to ultra-relativistic energies, they move
along helical trajectories, see Fig. 8 (a), advancing for-
ward in x-direction with almost speed of light and ro-
tating along the slowly evolving circle or ellipse in (y, z)-
plane .

Using the dimensionless variables deﬁned by Eqs. (11),
it is convenient to rewrite the equations of motion (1) and
(2) in the following form:

˙˜px = −4Ec( ˙˜y cos φ + ˙˜z sin φ),
˙˜p⊥ = −˜r⊥ + ˙φEc(ey cos φ + ez sin φ),

(33)

(34)

where Ec ≡ ac(ωp/ωL)˜vphI−3/2
. In the paraxial approx-
imation, the time evolution of the wave phase and of the
electron transverse coordinates are again determined by
Eqs. (12). One can verify that the integral of motion (15)
also holds in the case of a circularly polarized laser pulse.
We now consider an electron moving along a slowly

approximate transverse electron velocity as |˙˜r⊥| ≈ |˜r⊥| ˙ψ,
where ˙ψ = ωβ/ω∗ = 1/˜p1/2
x . Making use of this relation-
ship, we ﬁnd from Eq. (15) that ˜r2⊥ = ˙˜r2⊥ ˜px = (1+χ˜px)/2,
which implies that kinetic and potential energies associ-
ated with the transverse motion are equal to each other.

8

Substituting the last result into the equation for the wave
phase (12), we obtain that, in contrast to the case of a
linearly polarized (LP) laser wave, the Doppler shifted
frequency does not oscillate when ultra-relativistic elec-
˙ψ = −ωD/ω∗ =
trons move along helical trajectories:
−1/˜px − 3χ. Thus, without applying the averaging pro-
cedure, we ﬁnd that the phase shift θ = ψ + φ satisﬁes
the following equation

Substituting ˜˙y = [(1 + χ˜px)/2]1/2 cos ψ ˙ψ and ˜˙z = [(1 +
χ˜px)/2˜px]1/2 sin ψ ˙ψ into Eq. (36), we ﬁnd that

˙˜px = −4Ec cos θ[(1 + χ˜px)/2˜px]1/2,

√
This equation is similar to Eq. (24) with Ec/
(Ec ≈ 0.5 E).

(36)
2 = αE

Figure 8 (b) illustrates the similarities of electron ac-
celeration by CP and LP laser waves with matching am-
plitudes. As one would expect, the phase trajectory in
the case of CP laser wave looks much smoother than in
the case of a LP laser wave.

Thus, equations (26) and (27) for the averaged phase
trajectory and the estimate (28) for the maximum energy
gain hold also for the acceleration by the CP laser wave.
However, the initial conditions at which electrons can be
actually accelerated to this energy (such as pre-heating)
are not the same as for the case of LP laser wave. More-
over at some laser-plasma parameters, electrons can move
in the transverse plane y − z along ellipses. In this case
the maximum gained energy can be signiﬁcantly smaller
than the energy obtained from Eq. (22).

C. Energy ampliﬁcation of pre-accelerated

electrons

Up to this point, we have assumed that the integral
of motion I0 is positive. For completeness, we consider
the dynamics of electrons with a negative I0. Such a
special case can be realized when electrons with an ini-
tially large longitudinal momentum, px|t=0 = pin (cid:29) mc,
are accelerated by a superluminal laser wave, vph > c.
Assuming that initially the electrons are placed on the
channel axis with py = pz = 0, we obtain that I0 ≈
−pin(vph − c)/mc2 < 0.

In contrast to the acceleration of initially cold elec-
trons, the dynamics of pre-accelerated electrons can be
described in the paraxial approximation right from the
very beginning of their motion. The process of gaining
energy now has a quite regular character. Initially, the
energy of transverse electron oscillations is equal exactly
to zero. Then it gradually increases with time making
a coupling between the wave and betatron oscillations
stronger and conversion of the wave energy to the energy
of the electron longitudinal motion more eﬃcient. After

9

scaling theory is demonstrated by predicting electron ac-
celeration and substantial energy gain via a previously
unknown third harmonic resonance in an ion channel.
Vacuum acceleration of electrons by a laser wave is
characterized by a single parameter γ∗ ≡ a2
0/2I0 (pmax =
mcγ∗). Acceleration in an ion channel introduces another
parameter, ˜p∗ ≡ I 2
0 (ωL/2ωp˜vph)2, that follows from the
resonant condition that the Doppler shifted frequency
is comparable to the frequency of betatron oscillations.
Note that γ∗/˜p∗ = E 2. Paradoxically, the energy gain
increases in the luminal case as the the strength of the
channel electric ﬁeld decreases and the inﬂuence of the
channel becomes weaker (E (cid:28) 1 and ωp/ωL (cid:28) 1). The
downside of working in this limit is that electrons must
be initially signiﬁcantly preheated in order to attain the
predicted maximum energy. In the super-luminal case,
one more parameter, characterizing the eﬀective wave
dispersion, comes into play: χ ∝ (vph/c − 1)/(ω2
p/ω2
L).
It increases the Doppler shifted frequency and introduces
an additional longitudinal momentum scale, p+ ∝ p∗/χ2,
which allows electrons to remain in resonance at signiﬁ-
cantly higher values of electron momentum.

Our model relies on a number of key simpliﬁcations
whose applicability must be examined in the context of a
speciﬁc problem of interest. In the developed model, we
assume a fully evacuated ion channel and a plane wave,
neglecting longitudinal electric ﬁelds of the laser wave.
The transverse variation of the laser ﬁeld might however
be important in the case of a tightly focused laser pulse
in an ion channel. The channel also might not be fully
evacuated and thus it might contain residual electrons
that are heated by the laser wave. It is also important to
point out that the phase velocity is not an independent
parameter and it is strongly inﬂuenced by the channel ra-
dius and the plasma density distribution. The impact of
these aspects on electron acceleration must be examined
via self-consistent ﬁrst-principle PIC simulations. Nev-
ertheless, such a simpliﬁed description of acceleration of
electrons by the laser wave has a powerful predictive ca-
pability demonstrated in Refs. [7, 8].

This work was motivated by laser-plasma interactions
at sub-critical plasma densities, but the developed ap-
proach is much more general and it is not limited just to
the regime where ωp (cid:28) ω. The theory is well suited to
make meaningful predictions regarding electron acceler-
ation in near-critical and over-critical plasmas, provided
that such plasmas are relativistically transparent to the
incoming high-intensity laser pulse. Wave propagation in
a relativistically transparent plasma is a critical aspect
of this regime that should be addressed self-consistently.

loosing their energy. A rigorous analysis of this regime is
given in Appendix B. Typically, the the electron energy
is ampliﬁed several times.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In summary, we have shown that acceleration of ultra-
relativistic electrons by a laser wave in an ion channel can
be parametrized in the paraxial approximation using just
two parameters. By averaging out betatron oscillations,
we have derived reduced equations of motion that can
be easily integrated to determine electron phase-space
trajectories. We have found that the appearance of for-
bidden zones in phase-space divides electron phase-space
trajectories into several unconnected segments. This re-
sults in a threshold dependence of the maximum energy
gained by electrons on laser and plasma parameters. The
universal scalings given by Eqs. (22) and (28) remain the
same even if electrons perform a three dimensional mo-
tion, which primarily introduces more irregularity into
electron dynamics and typically delays reaching the max-
imum energy by the electron. The derived scalings can
be used to make preliminary estimates for the contribu-
tion of DLA in wakeﬁeld accelerators. They can also be
directly applied to examine DLA of electrons by a cir-
cularly polarized laser. The capability of the universal

Let us consider a luminal case with χ = 0 and assume

In the

at small χ.

We consider an initially pre-accelerated electron with
px|t=0 = pin >> mc and py|t=0 = 0 placed on the chan-
nel axis so that

I0 ≈ −(vph/c − 1)pin/mc.

Transverse electron energy grows with the longitudinal
momentum as ε⊥ = −|I0|mec2 + px(vph − c).
In the

˙˜px = −4|E| ˙˜y cos φ,
˙φ = −2( ˙˜y2 + |χ|), ,

and I0 is determined by Eq. (B1).
It follows from
Eqs. (B6) and (B7) that the initial momentum in di-
mensionless variables is ˜pin = 1/|χ| and that the initial
energy of the transverse oscillations is equal to zero. The
laser wave slowly pumps energy into the transverse os-
cillations which is converted to the increasing momen-
tum/energy of the longitudinal motion, see Fig. 9 (a) ac-
cording to the relationship: ⊥/mec2 = |I0|(px/pin − 1).
Assuming that the longitudinal momentum changes
slowly, we obtain ˜y = (−1 + |χ|˜px)1/2 sin ψ,
˙ψ ≈ 1/˜p1/2
x ,
˙˜y ≈ [(−1 + |χ|˜px)/˜px]1/2 cos ψ and (cid:104) ˙φ(cid:105) = 1/˜px − 3|χ|.

cillations satisﬁes the following equation:
x + 1/˜px − 3|χ|.

Near the resonance ωβ ≈ (cid:104)ωD(cid:105) the equation for the lon-

threshold (white line) in the parameter space (|χ|,|E|) as-
sociated with the minimum of the function H(|χ|,|χ|˜px)
which is reached at the resonant point ˜px = ˜p+. When
parameters |χ| and |E| belong to the area at the left of
the white line, electrons move along small segment of
the averaged phase trajectory and their longitudinal mo-
mentum ˜px cannot exceed ˜p+. On contrary, when pa-
rameters |χ| and |E| belong to the area at the right of
the white line, electrons move along the entire phase tra-
jectory reaching larger values of the momentum. The
threshold can be determined from the following condi-
tion

4|E||H(|χ|,|χ|˜p+) − H(|χ|,|χ|˜pin)| ≈ C0.

(B15)

The numerical analysis shows that the constant C0 in the
right-hand side is equal to 3 rather than the theoretical
value 2.

It is interesting to note that there is a red area in the
right upper corner in Fig. 9 (a) with large ampliﬁcation
factors. The parameters in this area correspond to third
harmonic (or some mixture of harmonics) resonances.

FIG. 10: Ampliﬁcation factor pmax/pin = AF (|χ|,|E|) for
initially pre-accelerated electrons.

Eq. (B10) is valid only near the resonance, this point
should be passed by the electron during its acceleration:
˜p+ > ˜pin and hence the parameter |χ| must be less than
1/4. As one can see from Eqs. (B12) and (B13), the
energy ampliﬁcation depends only on parameters |E| and
|χ|:

pmax/pin = |χ|pmax = AF (|χ|,|E|)
