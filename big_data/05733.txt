ESTIMATION OF WEIGHTED L2 NORM RELATED TO

DEMAILLY’S STRONG OPENNESS CONJECTURE

QI’AN GUAN, ZHENQIAN LI, AND XIANGYU ZHOU

Abstract. In the present article, we obtain an estimation of the weighted L2
norm near the singularities of plurisubharmonic weight related to Demailly’s
strong openness conjecture, which implies the convergence of the weighted L2
norm.

1. introduction

Let D ⊂ Cn be a bounded pseudoconvex domain, o ∈ D the origin of Cn and
ϕ ∈ P sh(D) a plurisubharmonic function on D. The multiplier ideal sheaf I (ϕ)
consists of germs of holomorphic functions f such that |f|2e−ϕ is locally integrable,
which is a coherent sheaf of ideals (see [1]).
Demailly’s strong openness conjecture (SOC) [2]: If (f, o) ∈ I (ϕ)o, then
there exists ε > 0 such that (f, o) ∈ I ((1 + ε)ϕ)o.
Note that I (ϕ)o is ﬁnitely generated by (fj)j=1,...,k0. Let I (ϕ)o = (f1, ..., fk0).
The truth of SOC implies that there exists εj > 0 such that (fj, o) ∈ I ((1 + εj)ϕ)o
for any 1 ≤ j ≤ k0. Then, SOC is equivalent to I (ϕ)o = I ((1 + ε0)ϕ)o, where
ε0 = min
1≤j≤k0{εj}. As I ((1 + ε0)ϕ)o ⊂ I+(ϕ)o := ∪ε>0I ((1 + ε)ϕ)o ⊂ I (ϕ)o, then

SOC is equivalent to I (ϕ)o = I+(ϕ)o.

In [8], Guan and Zhou proved the above SOC. Moreover, they also established

an eﬀectiveness about ε of the conjecture in [9].

Let L2

O(D) be the Hilbert space of homomorphic functions on D with ﬁnite L2

norm

L2

O(D) := {f ∈ O(D)(cid:12)(cid:12) ||f||2

D = ZD |f|2dλn < ∞}.

Let I ⊂ Oo be an ideal and (ek)k∈N+ an orthonormal basis of

whose inner product is deﬁned to be (f, g) = RD f · gdλn.

By the truth of SOC and the above Corollary, we have the following convergence

of the weighted L2 norm related to SOC:

Corollary 1.2. Let (ϕj)j∈N+ be a sequence of negative plurisubharmonic functions
on D, which is convergent to ϕ in Lebesgue measure, and I (ϕj)o ⊂ I (ϕ)o. Let
(Fj)j∈N+ be a sequence of holomorphic functions on D with (Fj, o) ∈ I (ϕ)o, which
is compactly convergent to a holomorphic function F . Then, |Fj|2e−ϕj converges
to |F|2e−ϕ in the L1
loc norm near o. In particular, there exists ε0 > 0 such that
I (ϕj)o = I ((1 + ε0)ϕj)o = I (ϕ)o for any large enough j.

The last conclusion in the above Corollary can be obtained by Proposition 1.8

in [9] and ﬁnite generation of I (ϕ)o.

Remark 1.1. Let (ϕj )j∈N+ be a sequence of negative plurisubharmonic functions
on D. If ϕj is convergent to ϕ in Lebesgue measure, then ϕj converges to ϕ in the
Lp
loc (0 < p < ∞) norm.

Proof. It suﬃces to prove p ∈ N+. By a small enough multiplication, it is enough
to assume the Lelong number ν(ϕ, o) < 1. Thus, I (ϕj )o ⊂ I (ϕ)o = Oo. Then,
the desired result follows from Corollary 1.2 and the inequality

1

p! ZD |ϕj − ϕ|pdλn ≤ ZD |e−ϕj − e−ϕ|dλn.

which follows from the inequality 1

p! (a − b)p ≤ (ea−b − 1)eb, for any a ≥ b ≥ 0. (cid:3)

2. Lemmas used in the proof of main results

We are now in a position to prove the following Lemma.

Lemma 2.1. Let I ⊂ Oo be an ideal and (ek)k∈N+ an orthonormal basis of

HI := {f∈L2

O(D)(cid:12)(cid:12)(f, o) ∈ I},

a closed subspace of L2
k0 > 0 and some constant C0 > 1 such that

O(D). Then, there exists a neighborhood U0⊂⊂D of o, integer

∞

Xk=1

|ek|2 ≤ C0 ·

k0

Xk=1

|ek|2

on U0.

Proof. It follows from the strong Noetherian property of coherent analytic sheaves
that the sequence of ideal sheaves generated by the holomorphic functions

(ek(z)ek(w))k≤N , N = 1, 2, ...,

on D×D is locally stationary.
that for any N ≥ k0 we have (ek(z)ek(w))k≤N = (ek(z)ek(w))k≤k0 on U . Since

Let U⊂⊂D be a neighborhood of the origin o. Then there exists k0 > 0 such

then

ek(z)ek(w) is uniformly convergent on every compact subset of D×D. By
the closedness of coherent ideal sheaves under the topology of compact conver-

Pk=1

gence (see [4]),

ek(z)ek(w) is a section of the coherent ideal sheaf generated by

(ek(z)ek(w))k≤k0 over U×U . Then, there exists a neighborhood U0⊂⊂U of o and
functions ak(z, w) ∈ O(U0×U0), 1 ≤ k ≤ k0, such that on U0×U0

Xk=1

ek(z)ek(w) =

Finally, by restricting to the conjugate diagonal w = z, we get

To prove Theorem 1.1, we also need the following Lemma, whose various forms

already appear in [5, 6, 7, 9].

Lemma 2.2. Let B0 ∈ (0, 1] be arbitrarily given and t0 a positive number. Let
Dv be a strongly pseudoconvex domain relatively compact in ∆n containing o. Let
F be a holomorphic function on ∆n. Let ϕ, ψ be two negative plurisubharmonic
functions on ∆n, such that ϕ(o) = ψ(o) = −∞. Then there exists a holomorphic
function Fv,t0 on Dv, such that,

By the truth of SOC, there exists ε0 > 0 such that I (ϕ) = I ((1 + ε0)ϕ)

we can assume that RD |Fj|2dλn is uniformly bounded. Let ek, 1 ≤ k ≤ k0, be as

Replacing ϕj by (1 + ε0)ϕj , we obtain the second assertion from the ﬁrst one.(cid:3)

4. Relation to semi-continuity of complex singularity exponents

In [3], Demailly and Koll´ar proved the following semi-continuity of complex sin-

gularity exponents.

Theorem 4.1. (Main Theorem 0.2, [3]). Let X be a complex manifold, K ⊂ X a
compact subset and ϕ a plurisubharmonic function on X. If c < cK(ϕ) and (ϕj)
is a sequence of plurisubharmonic functions on X which is convergent to ϕ in L1
loc
norm, then e−2cϕj converges to e−2cϕ in L1 norm over some neighborhood U of K.

Indeed, by subtracting a constant, we can assume ϕ is negative on K. As

RK ϕjdλn ≤ RK |ϕ − ϕj|dλn + RK ϕdλn, we obtain that ϕj is also negative on K.
Then, Theorem 4.1 is a special case of Corollary 1.2 when I (ϕ)o = Oo. With
additional condition ϕj ≤ ϕ, Theorem 4.1 can be referred to [10] for multiplier
ideals, which is also a special case of Corollary 1.2.
If ϕ = log |g| for J-vector holomorphic functions g(z, c) = (g1, ..., gJ ) on a poly-

disk ∆n × ∆, then it follows that
Theorem 4.2. (Main Theorem, [11]). Assume that R∆n |g(z, 0)|−δ < ∞. Then
there exists a smaller polydisk ∆′n × ∆′ so that the function c 7→ R∆′n |g(z, c)|−δ is
ﬁnite and continuous for c ∈ ∆′.
