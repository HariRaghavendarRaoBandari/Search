A Moufang set is essentially a doubly transitive permutation group such that
each point stabilizer contains a normal subgroup which is regular on the remaining
vertices; these regular normal subgroups are called the root groups, and they are
assumed to be conjugate and to generate the whole group.

It has been known for some time that every Jordan division algebra gives rise
to a Moufang set with abelian root groups. We extend this result by showing that
every structurable division algebra gives rise to a Moufang set, and conversely, we
show that every Moufang set arising from a simple linear algebraic group of relative
rank one over an arbitrary ﬁeld k of characteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3 arises from
a structurable division algebra.

We also obtain explicit formulas for the root groups, the τ -map and the Hua
maps of these Moufang sets. This is particularly useful for the Moufang sets arising
from exceptional linear algebraic groups.

Introduction

A Moufang set is essentially a doubly transitive permutation group such that
each point stabilizer contains a normal subgroup which is regular on the remaining
vertices; these regular normal subgroups are called the root groups, and they are
assumed to be conjugate and to generate the whole group. A Moufang set is called
proper if it is not sharply doubly transitive.

Moufang sets were introduced by Jacques Tits in 1990 [Tit92] in the context
of twin buildings, and they provide an important tool to study absolutely simple
linear algebraic groups of relative rank one, in the same spirit as spherical buildings
play a crucial role in the understanding of isotropic algebraic groups of higher
relative rank. There is, in fact, an ongoing attempt to understand the classiﬁcation
of absolutely simple algebraic groups over an arbitrary ﬁeld purely in terms of
the theory of spherical buildings, using a theory of Galois descent in buildings
[MPW15, MW15].

In [DMW06], it is shown that every Jordan division algebra gives rise to a
Moufang set with abelian root groups, and in fact, every known proper Moufang set
with abelian root groups arises from a Jordan division algebra. The description of
the known proper Moufang sets with non-abelian root groups, on the other hand,
was done case by case.

In the current paper, we show that every structurable division algebra gives
rise to a Moufang set. It turns out that every known proper Moufang set arises
from a structurable division algebra, provided that the root groups do not contain
elements of order 2 or 3. (The known examples where this condition does not hold
all arise by twisting certain algebraic structures over ﬁelds of characteristic 2 or 3,
and include the Suzuki groups and the rank one Ree groups over ﬁelds admitting
a Tits endomorphism.)

Structurable algebras have been introduced by Bruce Allison in [All78] in order
to construct isotropic simple Lie algebras using a generalization of the Tits–Kantor–
Koecher construction (see also section 2.4 below). Because of the connections be-
tween simple linear algebraic groups and simple Lie algebras, it is not surprising that
there is also a deep connection between structurable algebras and linear algebraic
groups. In case of Jordan algebras, this connection has been thoroughly investigated
and uniformized by Tonny Springer [Spr73] and Ottmar Loos [Loo78, Loo79] (in
a more general setting of Jordan pairs). Namely, one obtains a classiﬁcation-free
natural correspondence between semisimple algebraic groups having a parabolic
subgroup with abelian unipotent radical, and separable Jordan pairs. The respec-
tive correspondence for arbitrary structurable algebras is not yet available in the
literature in full generality, although a lot of results have been established on a

INTRODUCTION

case-by-case basis, most notably for simple structurable algebras of skew-dimension
one [Bro69, Gar01, Kru07].

In the current paper, we focus on the Moufang sets corresponding to absolutely
simple linear algebraic groups of relative rank one. More precisely, we show that,
over ﬁelds k with char(k) 6= 2, 3, every structurable division algebra gives rise to a
Moufang set, and conversely, that every Moufang set arising from a simple linear
algebraic group of k-rank one over a ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, 3 arises from a struc-
turable division algebra in this fashion. This necessarily includes an investigation of
the aforementioned connection between structurable (division) algebras and linear
algebraic groups (of relative rank one). Our treatment here is uniform and free
from case-by-case considerations.

Our new construction of Moufang sets from structurable division algebras gives,
in particular, an explicit description of the Moufang sets arising from exceptional
algebraic groups, including the permutation “τ ” of the Moufang sets, and also
including a surprisingly easy description of the “Hua maps”. This eﬀectively allows
to perform computations, which in turn help to understand the structure of these
groups in a diﬀerent way. The explicit description of the Moufang sets arising from
exceptional groups has been considered to be one of the major challenges in the
theory of Moufang sets.

4,1 (see [DMVM10]), for groups of type 2E29

At this moment, such a description was known for some particular cases, namely
for groups of type F 21
6,1 (see [CDM14])
and E78
7,1 (for which we could not ﬁnd an explicit proof in the literature). The
structure of the root groups for groups of type 3,6D9
4,1 and for groups of type 2E35
6,1
was obtained in [CHM08], but this description is in terms of coordinates (and
hence gives less insight). For the other exceptional groups of relative rank one,
even the structure of the root groups was, to the best of our knowledge, unknown.

We were inspired by the examples of Moufang sets arising from Jordan alge-
bras and by the known examples of Moufang sets with non-abelian root groups, in
particular those of type F 21
4,1 and those arising as residues of exceptional Moufang
quadrangles (implicit in [TW02, (33.14)], and explicitly described in [DM06]). It
turns out that each of these examples arises from a speciﬁc type of structurable
algebra. Indeed, every Jordan division algebra is also a structurable algebra (with
trivial involution); the Moufang sets of type F 21
4,1 arise from an octonion division
algebra with standard involution; and the residues of exceptional Moufang quad-
rangles arise from structurable algebras as described in [BDM13].

As a consequence of our main result, we can rely on the classiﬁcation of struc-
turable division algebras (over a ﬁeld k of characteristic 6= 2, 3) to get a complete,
and in most cases very explicit description for all Moufang sets arising from ex-
ceptional algebraic groups of k-rank one. The classiﬁcation of structurable division
algebras is deduced from the classiﬁcation of all central simple structurable algebras
carried out by Allison and Smirnov [All78, Smi92] when char k 6= 2, 3, 5; in the
present paper, we show in addition that the classiﬁcation by Allison and Smirnov
remains valid over ﬁelds of characteristic 5, i.e., no new classes of central simple
structurable algebras arise.

ORGANIZATION OF THE PAPER

Organization of the paper

In Chapter 1, we introduce the notions from the theory of Moufang sets that
we will need later.
In particular, we give some details about how to associate
a Moufang set to each absolutely simple linear algebraic group of k-rank 1. We
then recall the construction of Moufang sets from Jordan division algebras and the
construction of Moufang sets from skew-hermitian forms, and in particular, we point
out that these two classes together already describe all Moufang sets arising from
classical linear algebraic groups of k-rank 1; see Remark 1.3.3 and Corollary 1.4.5.
(The Moufang sets arising from Jordan division algebras also include one case of
exceptional Moufang sets, namely those of type E78

7,1.)

In Chapter 2, we recall some facts from the theory of structurable algebras.
We then focus on structurable division algebras, and in section 2.3, we spend some
time going over each of the diﬀerent classes and pointing out when these algebras
are division algebras. This is a non-trivial question, which, in fact, is open in some
speciﬁc cases; see Remark 2.3.10 and Remark 2.3.18 below. We then recall the
construction of Lie algebras from structurable algebras and we collect some facts
about isotopies.

The real work then starts in Chapter 3. We build upon earlier work by Bruce
Allison and John Faulkner, and study one-invertibility for structurable algebras
A, which is a property for pairs of elements in A × S, where S is the subspace
of skew elements of A. Our main result of that section is Theorem 3.3.7 and its
Corollary 3.3.8, showing that for structurable division algebras, all non-zero pairs
are one-invertible, and providing an explicit formula for the left and right inverse of
such a pair. The notion of one-invertibility turns out to be a crucial ingredient for
the construction of the corresponding Moufang sets. One issue that comes up here
is that, in order to include the case char(k) = 5, we need an additional condition on
the structurable algebras, which we call algebraicity; see section 3.1. This condition
also plays important role in Chapter 4.

Chapter 4 deals with the connection between structurable algebras and simple
linear algebraic groups. We do the construction of simple algebraic groups from
simple structurable algebras in full generality (section 4.1), but for the converse,
we restrict to the case of k-rank one (section 4.3). Although this connection is
believed to be well known, the situation is, in fact, rather delicate. One issue is
that in characteristic 5, this requires the algebraicity condition mentioned above;
another issue is that there are several diﬀerent but closely related Lie algebras
in the picture, and it is crucial to distinguish them carefully and to understand
what the connection is between these diﬀerent Lie algebras. See, in particular,
Construction 4.1.2, Corollary 4.1.9 and most notably Lemma 4.3.3, which in turn
depends on the recognition Lemma 4.2.3, the proof of which is rather involved.
Our main results in Chapter 4 are Theorem 4.1.1 and Theorem 4.3.1. We also show
that structurable division algebras are always algebraic, even if char(k) = 5; see
Theorem 4.2.8.

The main goal of the paper is reached in Chapter 5. In that section, we show
that every structurable division algebra over a ﬁeld k of characteristic diﬀerent from
2 and 3 gives rise to a Moufang set, and conversely, every Moufang set arising from
an absolutely simple linear algebraic k-group of k-rank 1 arises from a structurable

INTRODUCTION

division algebra; see Theorem 5.1.6 and Theorem 5.2.1.
In Corollary 5.2.7, we
show that the resulting Moufang sets are isomorphic if and only if the structurable
division algebras are isotopic. Theorem 5.1.6 also gives an explicit description of
the Moufang set (including its τ -map), directly in terms of the structurable division
algebra. In addition, we get a surprisingly simple expression for the so-called Hua
maps of the Moufang set; these maps are usually very hard to compute directly
from their deﬁnition, and it is an unexpected side result of our approach that we
get a description of these maps without any eﬀort in Theorem 5.1.10.

In the ﬁnal Chapter 6, we illustrate our results by presenting explicit descrip-
tions for all Moufang sets arising from linear algebraic groups of k-rank 1; of course,
the most interesting results arise for the exceptional linear algebraic groups. We
recover all of the earlier known results, and in addition, we get new descriptions
for some Moufang sets that had not been described earlier in the literature. See, in
particular, Theorem 6.4.3, Theorem 6.4.4 and Corollary 6.5.3, which together cover
all Moufang sets with non-abelian root groups that arise from exceptional linear
algebraic groups of k-rank 1. In section 6.6, ﬁnally, we extend the classiﬁcation of
structurable division algebras to ﬁelds of characteristic 5.

CHAPTER 1

Moufang sets

We repeat the most important notions from the theory of Moufang sets which
we will need. For a general introduction to Moufang sets, we refer the reader to
[DMS09].

1.1. Deﬁnitions and basic properties

As is common in the theory of Moufang sets, we will always denote group
actions on the right. Also, when A is a group, we will often use the notation A∗
to denote A without its identity element. We denote conjugation in a group by
gh := h−1gh.

following two properties are satisﬁed:

Definition 1.1.1. Let X be a set (with |X| ≥ 3) and {Ux | x ∈ X} be a
collection of subgroups of Sym(X). The data(cid:0)X,{Ux}x∈X(cid:1) is a Moufang set if the
(M1) For each x ∈ X, Ux ﬁxes x and acts regularly (i.e. sharply transitively) on
(M2) For each g ∈ G+ := hUx | x ∈ Xi and each y ∈ X, we have U g
The group G+ is called the little projective group of the Moufang set, and the groups
Ux are called the root groups.

X \ {x}.

y = Uy.g.

Note that (M1) implies that G+ acts doubly transitively on X. The Moufang

set is called proper if the action is not sharply doubly transitive.

Moufang sets are essentially equivalent to groups with a saturated split BN-
pair of rank one, and to abstract rank one groups, a notion introduced by Franz
Timmesfeld. This point of view will, in fact, be suitable for our purposes.

Definition 1.1.2 ([Tim01]). An abstract rank one group (with unipotent sub-
groups A and B) is a group G together with a pair of distinct nilpotent subgroups
A and B such that G = hA, Bi, and such that

for each a ∈ A∗, there is a (unique) b(a) ∈ B∗ such that Ab(a) = Ba,

and similarly with the roles of A and B interchanged.

The following lemma shows that the two previous deﬁnitions are essentially

equivalent.

(i) Let (X,{Ux}x∈X) be a Moufang set with nilpotent root
Lemma 1.1.3.
groups, and choose two arbitrary elements 0,∞ ∈ X. Then G+ = hU0, U∞i
is an abstract rank one group.

1

2

1. MOUFANG SETS

(ii) Let G = hA, Bi be an abstract rank one group. Deﬁne
Y := {Ag | g ∈ G} = {Ab | b ∈ B} ∪ {B}
= {Bg | g ∈ G} = {Ba | a ∈ A} ∪ {A}.

For each x ∈ Y , deﬁne Ux := x ≤ G, and consider the action of G on Y by
conjugation. Then (Y,{Ux}x∈Y ) is a Moufang set with G+ ∼= G/Z(G).
Proof. See [DMS09, Section 2.2].

(cid:3)

Remark 1.1.4. For many purposes, the additional requirement on the root
groups to be nilpotent is not needed, and in fact, it is an open problem whether
there exist proper Moufang sets with root groups that are not nilpotent. Even
more, all known examples of proper Moufang sets have root groups of nilpotency
class at most three.

In the following construction we show how to describe a Moufang set using only
one group U and a permutation of U ∗. The advantage of this description is that the
only required data are a group and a permutation. This should be compared with
Deﬁnition 1.1.1, where we need a set X and a collection of subgroups of Sym(X),
and with Deﬁnition 1.1.2, where we need to describe the ambient group G (and two
of its subgroups).

Construction 1.1.5 ([DMW06, Section 3]). Let M = (X, (Ux)x∈X) be an

arbitrary Moufang set, and let 0 6= ∞ ∈ X be two arbitrary elements.

Deﬁne the set U := X \ {∞}. For each a ∈ U , we deﬁne αa as the unique

element in U∞ mapping 0 to a. By (M1), U∞ = {αa | a ∈ U}.

We now make U into a group (U, +) by deﬁning a + b := a.αb = 0.αaαb for all
a, b ∈ U . It is clear that this is a (not necessarily commutative) group, with neutral
a = α−a; moreover, U ∼= U∞. (The action of U∞ on X is
element α0, and with α−1
essentially the right regular representation of the group (U, +).)

By [DMS09, Proposition 4.1.1], there is, for each a ∈ U \ {0}, a unique per-

mutation

(1.1)

µa ∈ U ∗

0 αaU ∗

0 ⊆ G+

interchanging 0 and ∞.

Now ﬁx an element e ∈ U\{0} and deﬁne τ := µe; then τ induces a permutation
of X \ {0,∞} = U ∗ (which we also denote by τ ). Since τ and αa are both in G+
for all a ∈ U , we have U τ

∞ = U∞.τ = U0 and U αa

0 = U0.αa = Ua.

It follows that in order to describe the Moufang set M = (X, (Ux)x∈X ), it is
suﬃcient to know the group U and the permutation τ ∈ Sym(U ∗). Therefore we
denote the Moufang set M = (X, (Ux)x∈X ) by M(U, τ ).

Remark 1.1.6. A slight disadvantage of this description is that the permuta-
tion τ is not uniquely determined by the Moufang set. However, it is shown in
[DMS09, Lemma 4.1.2] that M(U, τ ) = M(U, µa) for all a ∈ U ∗, and in fact, the
data(cid:0)U, (µa)a∈U ∗(cid:1) is uniquely determined by the Moufang set. On the other hand,
see [Loo15] for a diﬀerent approach to Moufang sets that avoids this issue.

1.1. DEFINITIONS AND BASIC PROPERTIES

3

Remark 1.1.7. Starting from an arbitrary group U together with a permuta-
tion τ of U ∗, the previous construction can be applied backwards. However, the
result is not always a Moufang set. We refer to [DMS09, Section 3] for the details
of this construction, and for the condition needed on U and τ in order to get a
Moufang set.

We will need the following explicit description of the µ-maps.
Lemma 1.1.8. Let M(U, τ ) be a Moufang set. For each a ∈ U ∗, we have

−(a.τ −1).

µa = ατ

(−a).τ −1αaατ

Proof. See [DMS09, Proposition 4.1.1].

(cid:3)

The following concept plays an important role in the theory of Moufang sets.
Definition 1.1.9. Let M(U, τ ) be a Moufang set. Then for each a ∈ U ∗, we
deﬁne a corresponding Hua map ha := τ µa ∈ Sym(X). It is clear that each ha ﬁxes
0 and ∞, and it is not hard to verify that (b + c).ha = b.ha + c.ha for all b, c ∈ U ,
i.e. the Hua maps induce automorphisms of the group U . We also deﬁne the Hua
group

H = hha | a ∈ U ∗i = hµaµb | a, b ∈ U ∗i ≤ Aut(U );

by [DMW06, Theorem 3.1(ii)], the Hua group is precisely the two point stabilizer
StabG(0,∞). See also [DMS09, Lemma 4.2.2]. In particular, a Moufang set is
proper if and only if H 6= 1.

Example 1.1.10. In order to illustrate the various deﬁnitions we have intro-
duced, we present the prototypical example of a Moufang set, which is the projective
line P1(D), acted upon by G = PSL2(D), where D is an arbitrary ﬁeld or skew ﬁeld.
In this case, the root groups are isomorphic to the additive group of D. More pre-
cisely, if we let U = (D, +), and τ : D× → D× : x 7→ −x−1, then M(U, τ ) is a
Moufang set with little projective group G; we denote it by M(D).

For any a ∈ D×, the corresponding µ-map µa is the map that takes any x ∈
X = D ∪ {∞} to −ax−1a. Notice that τ = µ1. The corresponding Hua map ha
maps any x ∈ X to axa.

Now we introduce what it means for Moufang sets to be isomorphic.
Definition 1.1.11. Let M = (X,{Ux}x∈X) and M′ = (X ′,{Uy}y∈X ′) be two
Moufang sets. We say that M and M′ are isomorphic if there exists a bijection
ϕ : X → X ′ such that the induced map Sym(X) → Sym(X ′) : g 7→ ϕ−1gϕ maps
each root group Ux isomorphically onto the corresponding root group Ux.ϕ.

We call ϕ an isomorphism from M to M′.

Next we translate the deﬁnition of isomorphic Moufang sets into several more

useful criteria.

(i) Let M = M(U, τ ) and M′ = M(U ′, τ ′) be two Moufang

sets. Then M and M′ are isomorphic if and only if there exists a group iso-
morphism ϕ : U → U ′ such that M(U ′, τ ′) = M(U ′, ϕ−1τ ϕ).

4

1. MOUFANG SETS

(ii) Let M = M(U, τ ) and M′ = M(U ′, τ ′) be two Moufang sets, and assume that
τ and τ ′ are contained in the little projective group G of M and G′ of M′,
respectively. Then M and M′ are isomorphic if and only if there exists a
group isomorphism ϕ : U → U ′ such that τ ′h′ = ϕ−1τ ϕ for some element
h′ ∈ H ′, the Hua group of M′.
(iii) Let M and M′ be two Moufang sets with corresponding abstract rank one groups
G = hA, Bi and G′ = hA′, B′i. Then M and M′ are isomorphic if and only if
there exists a group isomorphism ϕ : G → G′ mapping A to A′ and B to B′.
(i) First assume that M = (X,{Ux}x∈X) = M(U, τ ) and M′ =
(X ′,{Uy}y∈X ′) = M(U ′, τ ′) are isomorphic with isomorphism ϕ : X → X ′.
We follow Construction 1.1.5 with two arbitrary elements 0,∞ ∈ X and with
0′ = 0.ϕ,∞′ = ∞.ϕ ∈ X ′.
a = ϕ−1αaϕ = αa.ϕ ∈ U∞′; therefore
µϕ
a = µa.ϕ. Now the restriction ϕ : U = X \{∞} → U ′ = X ′\{∞′} is a group
isomorphism, since for all a, b ∈ U

It is clear that for all a ∈ U ∗, αϕ

Proof.

(a + b).ϕ = (aαb).ϕ = a.ϕαϕ

b = a.ϕαb.ϕ = a.ϕ + b.ϕ.
Moreover, by Deﬁnition 1.1.11, ϕ−1U0ϕ = U0′, and hence

and hence the two Moufang sets M(U ′, τ ′) and M(U ′, ϕ−1τ ϕ) coincide.

,

Conversely, assume that there exists a group isomorphism ϕ : U → U ′
such that M(U ′, τ ′) = M(U ′, ϕ−1τ ϕ). We extend ϕ : X → X ′ to a bi-
jection of sets by deﬁning ∞.ϕ = ∞′. Following Construction 1.1.5, it is
clear that the induced map ϕ : Sym(X) → Sym(X ′) maps U∞ to U∞′ . The
same computation as in equation (1.2), but now using the assumption that
M(U ′, τ ′) = M(U ′, ϕ−1τ ϕ), yields that ϕ maps U0 to U0′. The result now
follows.

(ii) This follows immediately from (i), since two elements of G′ that swap 0′ and

∞′ diﬀer by an element of H ′; see Deﬁnition 1.1.9.

(iii) This is clear from Lemma 1.1.3.

(cid:3)

1.2. Moufang sets from linear algebraic groups

One of the main motivations for studying Moufang sets is their connection
with (semi)simple linear algebraic groups of relative rank one. We now explain this
connection in some detail.

Let G be a semisimple linear algebraic group over an arbitrary ﬁeld k, and
assume that G has k-rank 1. Let X be the set of all proper parabolic k-subgroups
of G; note that the assumption on the k-rank implies that every proper parabolic
k-subgroup is in fact a minimal parabolic k-subgroup. For each P ∈ X, we let
UP := Ru(P)(k), i.e. the set of k-rational points of the unipotent radical of P.

Theorem 1.2.1. Let G be a semisimple linear algebraic group over an arbitrary
ﬁeld k of k-rank 1, and let X and the groups UP be as above. Then M(G) :=

(cid:0)X, (UP)P∈X(cid:1) is a Moufang set.

1.2. MOUFANG SETS FROM LINEAR ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

5

Proof. We decided to include an explicit proof of this (known) fact, which
seems hard to ﬁnd in the literature. Recall that two k-parabolics P and P′ in X
are called opposite if their intersection is a Levi subgroup of both, or equivalently,
if P ∩ Ru(P′) = P′ ∩ Ru(P) = 1; see [BT65, 4.8 and 4.10]. By [BT65, 4.8] again,
each k-parabolic P has at least one opposite k-parabolic P′, and any two such
opposites P′ and P′′ are conjugate by a unique element of Ru(P)(k).

We claim that, in our situation where the k-rank is 1, any two elements P, P′
of X are, in fact, opposite to each other. Indeed, let T be a maximal k-split torus
for which CG(T) ≤ P ∩ P′; such a torus exists by [BT65, 4.18]. Also, because G
has k-rank 1 and hence a relative Weyl group of order 2, [BT65, 5.9] implies that
P and P′ are the only two minimal k-parabolics containing T.

Now P is opposite to some minimal k-parabolic P′′, and again there is some
maximal k-split torus S such that CG(S) ≤ P ∩ P′′. Since all maximal k-split tori
are k-conjugate, it follows that P∩ P′′ is k-conjugate to P∩ P′. Using our previous
observation that P and P′ are the only two minimal k-parabolics containing T, we
conclude that P and P′ are also opposite to each other, and this proves the claim.
It follows that for any P ∈ X, the group UP = Ru(P)(k) acts sharply transi-
tively on the remaining elements of X.
It is also clear that the groups UP are
permuted by conjugation by elements of G(k), and this shows that M(G) :=
(cid:3)

(cid:0)X, (UP)P∈X(cid:1) is indeed a Moufang set.

Example 1.2.2. Let k be a commutative ﬁeld, and let D be a division algebra
over k of degree d. Then the group PSL2(D) is (the group of k-rational points of)
an algebraic group G over k with Tits index

A(d)

2d−1,1

,

and every group G over k with this Tits index is obtained in this fashion; see
[Tit66, p. 55]. The root groups of the Moufang set M(G) are isomorphic to the
additive group of D, and since G(k) = PSL2(D) is simple, it coincides with the little
projective group of M(G). Hence we have recovered the Moufang sets from Exam-
ple 1.1.10 for skew ﬁelds which are ﬁnite-dimensional over their center. (Clearly, if
the skew ﬁeld is inﬁnite-dimensional over its center, then the corresponding Mou-
fang set cannot arise from an algebraic group in this fashion.)

Definition 1.2.3 ([BT65, 0.7]). A semisimple k-group G is called k-simple
(respectively, almost k-simple), if every proper normal closed k-subgroup of G is
trivial (respectively, ﬁnite). A semisimple k-group G is called absolutely simple, or
just simple, if G¯k is ¯k-simple, where ¯k is an algebraic closure of k, or, equivalently,
if G is adjoint and the root system of G¯k is irreducible.

Note that a k-simple algebraic k-group G is automatically adjoint, since Cent(G)

is trivial. Conversely, an adjoint almost k-simple group is k-simple.

Lemma 1.2.4. Let k be a ﬁeld such that |k| ≥ 4. Let G be an adjoint semisimple
algebraic k-group of k-rank 1. For any two opposite proper parabolic subgroups P+,
P− of G, the subgroup G(k)+ = hRu(P+)(k),Ru(P−)(k)i of G(k) is isomorphic
to the little projective group of the Moufang set M(G).

Proof. By Lemma 1.1.3 the group G(k)+ is an abstract rank one group
corresponding to M(G), and the little projective group M(G)+ is isomorphic to

6

1. MOUFANG SETS

G(k)+/Z(G(k)+). Thus, it is enough to show that Z(G(k)+) = 1. By [BT73,
Proposition 6.2] G(k)+ coincides with the subgroup of G(k) generated by the
k-points of all unipotent radicals of all parabolic k-subgroups of G. Since |k| ≥ 4,
by the main theorem of [Tit64], any subgroup of G(k) normalized by G(k)+ is
central in G or contains G(k)+. Clearly, G(k)+ is non-abelian (for example, since
it is perfect by [BT73, Corollaire 6.4]). Therefore, Z(G(k)+) ⊆ Cent(G)(k). Since
G is adjoint, Cent(G) is trivial, and hence Z(G(k)+) is trivial.

(cid:3)

Lemma 1.2.5. Let k be an arbitrary ﬁeld, and let G be a semisimple algebraic

k-group of k-rank 1. Let P be a minimal parabolic k-subgroup of G.
(i) Let G′ be a semisimple k-group and f : G → G′ be a central k-isogeny. Then
G′ has k-rank 1 and the assignment P 7→ f (P) induces an isomorphism of
Moufang sets M(G) ∼= M(G′).
(ii) There is a unique minimal closed normal semisimple k-subgroup G0 of G such
that the k-rank of G0 is 1. This k-subgroup G0 is almost k-simple, and the
assignment P 7→ P ∩ G0 induces an isomorphism M(G0) ∼= M(G). If G is
adjoint, then G0 is adjoint.
(iii) If G is k-simple, then there is a ﬁnite separable ﬁeld extension l/k and an
absolutely simple algebraic l-group H of l-rank 1, such that G is k-isomorphic
to the Weil restriction Rl/k(H). The assignment Q 7→ Rl/k(Q), where Q is a
minimal parabolic l-subgroup of H, induces an isomorphism M(H) ∼= M(G).
(i) By [Bor91, Theorem 22.6] parabolic subgroups of G′ are the im-
ages of parabolic subgroups of G, and parabolic subgroups of G are preimages
of parabolic subgroups of G′. Since f is central, ker f is contained in any Levi
subgroup of any minimal parabolic subgroup P of G. Therefore, f induces a
bijection beween the sets of minimal parabolic subgroups of G and G′, and
for any minimal parabolic subgroup P of G we have Ru(P) ∼= Ru(f (P)).
Therefore, f induces an isomorphism M(G) ∼= M(G′). (See also [BT72a,
Théorème 2.20].)

Proof.

nQi=0

(ii) By [Bor91, Theorem 22.10] there is a central k-isogeny f :

Gi → G, where
G0, G1, . . . , Gn are all minimal closed connected normal k-subgroups of G
of positive dimension. Also, G0, . . . , Gn are almost k-simple. By [Bor91,
Proposition 22.9] the k-rank of G is equal to the sum of k-ranks of Gi, 0 ≤
i ≤ n. Therefore, there is a unique index i such that the k-rank of Gi
is 1; we can assume that i = 0 without loss of generality. Since, clearly,
Cent(G0) ⊆ Cent(G), we conclude that G0 is adjoint, once G is adjoint.

In order to show that the assignment P 7→ P∩G0 induces an isomorphism
Gi = G. Let P be a minimal

of Moufang sets, by (i) we can assume that

nQi=0

parabolic k-subgroup of G, and let S be a maximal split k-subtorus S of G
such that CentG(S) is a Levi subgroup of P. Clearly, S is contained in G0.
Hence

(1.3)

nYi=1

Gi ⊆ CentG(S) ⊆ P.

This shows that the map P 7→ P ∩ G0 is an injection from the set of minimal
parabolic subgroups of G to the set of smooth closed k-subgroups of G0.

1.3. MOUFANG SETS FROM JORDAN ALGEBRAS

7

Furthermore, since G0/P∩ G0 ∼= G/P is projective, we conclude that P∩ G0
is parabolic. Conversely, for any proper parabolic k-subgroup Q of G0, the
proper smooth k-subgroup P = Q×
the minimal parabolic subgroups of G and G0 are in bijective correspondence.
Moreover, by (1.3) we have

Gi of G is parabolic. This shows that

nQi=1

Ru(P) = Ru(Q ×

nYi=1

Gi) = Ru(Q).

Hence the map P 7→ P ∩ G0 induces an isomorphism M(G) ∼= M(G0).
(iii) Since G is k-simple, it is adjoint. By [DG70a, Exp. XXIV Proposition 5.10]
any adjoint semisimple k-group is isomorphic to a direct product of semisimple
groups of the form RA/k(H), where A is a ﬁnite-dimensional commutative
étale k-algebra, and H is an adjoint semisimple group scheme over A such that
Hk(s) is simple for any s ∈ Spec A. Since G is k-simple, there can be only one
factor of this form, that is, G ∼= RA/k(H). Further, such an algebra A over k
is isomorphic to a ﬁnite product l1× l2× . . .× ln, where li, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, are ﬁnite
separable ﬁeld extensions of k. Since Rl1×l2×...×ln/k(H) ∼=Qn
i=1 Rli/k(H), we
conclude that n = 1, that is, G ∼= Rl/k(H), where l is a ﬁnite separable ﬁeld
extension of k and H is an adjoint absolutely simple l-group. (See also [BT65,
6.21(ii)] for a similar statement for semisimple almost k-simple groups.)

By [BT65, Corollaire 6.19] the functor Rl/k provides a bijection between
the sets of parabolic l-subgroups of H and parabolic k-subgroups of G. Since
the k-rank of G is 1, every proper parabolic k-subgroup of G is minimal,
hence the same is true for H. This proves that H has l-rank 1. Further, for

any any minimal parabolic l-subgroup Q of H, we have Ru(Rl/k(cid:0)Q)(cid:1)(k) =
Rl/k(cid:0)Ru(Q)(cid:1)(k) = Ru(Q)(l). Then, clearly, Rl/k induces an isomorphism
M(H) ∼= M(G).
Remark 1.2.6. For later reference, we present the complete list of exceptional
Tits indices of relative rank 1 in Table 1; there are exactly nine families. In every
case, each root group U = UP is either an abelian group (when the relative root
system is of type A1), or U is nilpotent of class two (when the relative root system
is of type BC1; in either case, both Z(U ) and U/Z(U ) have the structure of a vector
space over k, and their dimensions can be computed from the root systems. See,
for example, [Tit66, p. 44].

1.3. Moufang sets from Jordan algebras

We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of quadratic Jordan algebras, as introduced by

K. McCrimmon [McC66].

Definition 1.3.1. Let k be an arbitrary commutative ﬁeld, let J be a vector
space over k of arbitrary dimension, and let 1 ∈ J ∗ be a distinguished element. For
each x ∈ J, let1 Ux ∈ Endk(J), and assume that the map U : J → End(J) : x 7→ Ux
1It is customary to denote these operators by Ux, and we hope that this will not cause any
confusion with our similar notation for the root groups of a Moufang set. In fact, this notation is
so standard that these operators are often referred to as the U-operators of the Jordan algebra.

is quadratic, i.e.

where

for all x, y ∈ J. Let

Utx = t2Ux for all t ∈ k, and
the map (x, y) 7→ Ux,y is k-bilinear,

Ux,y := Ux+y − Ux − Uy

Vx,yz := {x y z} := Ux,zy

for all x, y, z ∈ J. Then the triple (J, U, 1) is a quadratic Jordan algebra if the
identities

(QJ1) U1 = idJ ;
(QJ2) UxVy,x = Vx,yUx ;
(QJ3) UUxy = UxUyUx

[“the fundamental identity”]

hold strictly, i.e. if they continue to hold in all scalar extensions of J. (It suﬃces
for them to hold in the polynomial extension Jk[t] and this is automatically true if
the base ﬁeld k has at least 4 elements.)

1.4. MOUFANG SETS FROM SKEW-HERMITIAN FORMS

An element x ∈ J is called invertible if there exists y ∈ J such that

Uxy = x

and UxUy1 = 1.

In this case y is called the inverse of x and is denoted y = x−1. An element x ∈ J
is invertible if and only if Ux is invertible, and we then have U −1
x = Ux−1. If all
elements in J ∗ are invertible, then (J, U, 1) is called a quadratic Jordan division
algebra.

We will often simply write J in place of the triple (J, U, 1).

Theorem 1.3.2 ([DMW06]). Let J be a quadratic Jordan division algebra.
Let U be the additive group of J, and let τ : U ∗ → U ∗ : x 7→ −x−1. Then M(U, τ )
is a Moufang set, which we will denote by M(J). Moreover, for each a ∈ U ∗, the
Hua map ha coincides with the map Ua.

Remark 1.3.3. All known examples of proper Moufang sets with abelian rout
groups can be described in this fashion, but it seems a hard problem to determine
whether there exist other examples.

Remark 1.3.4. Over ﬁelds k with char(k) 6= 2, an equivalent (and in fact
the more classical) deﬁnition is that J is a Jordan algebra over k if it is a unital
commutative non-associative2 algebra such that

(x2 · y) · x = x2 · (y · x)

for all x, y ∈ J. The correspondence with the deﬁnition of a quadratic Jordan
algebra is given by Uxy = 2x · (x · y) − x2 · y for all x, y ∈ J. In particular,
(1.4)
for all x, y, z ∈ J.

Vx,yz = {x y z} = 2(cid:0)(x · y) · z + (z · y) · x − (z · x) · y(cid:1)

Example 1.3.5.
(i) Let D be an associative division algebra over k, and
let J = D+ be the quadratic Jordan algebra deﬁned by D, i.e. we deﬁne
Uab := aba for all a, b ∈ D. (When char(k) 6= 2, this means that we deﬁne a
Jordan multiplication by the rule a · b := (ab + ba)/2.) Then M(J) = M(D),
where M(D) is as in Example 1.1.10.
(ii) Let J be an exceptional quadratic Jordan division algebra (i.e. an Albert
division algebra). In this case, the corresponding Moufang set arises from a
linear algebraic group of type E78
7,1; this follows, for instance, from [Spr73,
14.31] (over ﬁelds of any characteristic).

1.4. Moufang sets from skew-hermitian forms

A large class of Moufang sets with non-abelian root groups arises from skew-
hermitian forms (see Deﬁnition 1.4.2 below). In this section, we will show that,
when the skew-hermitian form is ﬁnite-dimensional over a skew ﬁeld which is ﬁnite-
dimensional over its center, then such a Moufang set arises from a classical linear
algebraic group, and conversely, every Moufang set arising from a classical linear
algebraic group and with non-abelian root groups is isomorphic to the Moufang set
of a skew-hermitian form.

2It is customary to talk about non-commutative or non-associative algebras to mean “not

necessarily commutative” and “not necessarily associative” algebras, respectively.

10

1. MOUFANG SETS

We will restrict to the case where the center of the underlying skew ﬁeld has
characteristic diﬀerent from 2, although this result can be generalized to arbitrary
characteristic. However, this requires the more general notion of a pseudo-quadratic
form, and the resulting unitary groups are not always reductive but only pseudo-
reductive in general.

Definition 1.4.1. Let D be a skew ﬁeld with involution σ, and let V be a

non-trivial right D-module. Assume that the center k := Z(D) has char(k) 6= 2.
(i) A skew-hermitian form on V is a bi-additive map h : V × V → D such that
h(v, w)σ = −h(w, v) and h(va, wb) = aσh(v, w)b for all v, w ∈ V and all
a, b ∈ D.

(ii) We will use the notation

Dσ := {a + aσ | a ∈ D} = FixD(σ),

where the equality holds by our assumption that char(k) 6= 2.
(iii) A skew-hermitian form h on V is non-degenerate if h(v, V ) = 0 only for
v = 0, and is anisotropic if h(v, v) = 0 only for v = 0. In particular, if h is
anisotropic, then h is non-degenerate. Notice that when h is anisotropic, then
in fact h(v, v) 6∈ Dσ whenever v 6= 0 because h(v, v)σ = −h(v, v) for all v ∈ V .
(iv) Let h : V × V → D be a skew-hermitian form on V . The unitary group U (h)
is deﬁned as

U (h) := {ϕ ∈ GLD(V ) | h(ϕ(v), ϕ(w)) = h(v, w) for all v, w ∈ V }.

Definition 1.4.2. Let D be a skew ﬁeld with involution σ, let V be a non-
trivial right D-module, and let h : V × V → D be an anisotropic skew-hermitian
form on V . Deﬁne a group

with group operation

U := {(v, a) ∈ V × D | h(v, v) = a − aσ},
(v, a) + (w, b) :=(cid:0)v + w, a + b + h(w, v)(cid:1),

and deﬁne a map τ ∈ Sym(U ∗) given by

(v, a).τ := (−va−1, a−1)

for all (v, a) ∈ U ∗. Then M(U, τ ) is a Moufang set, which we call a skew-hermitian
Moufang set or a Moufang set of skew-hermitian type, and which we denote by
M(D, σ, V, h), or simply by M(h).

Theorem 1.4.3. Let D be a skew ﬁeld with involution σ, let V be a non-trivial
right D-module, and let h : V × V → D be an anisotropic skew-hermitian form on
V . Assume that D is ﬁnite-dimensional over its center k = Z(D), and that V is
ﬁnite-dimensional over D. Let ˆV := D ⊕ V ⊕ D, and consider the skew-hermitian
form

ˆh : ˆV × ˆV → D : (cid:0)(a, v, b), (c, w, d)(cid:1) 7→ aσd − bσc + h(v, w)

of Witt index 1. Then the unitary group U (ˆh) is a semisimple linear algebraic group
of k-rank 1, and its Moufang set is isomorphic to M(h).

Proof. The fact that G = U (ˆh) is a semisimple linear algebraic group of
k-rank 1 is well known. One possible reference, which also includes the description
in characteristic 2 using pseudo-quadratic forms, is [BT87, Section 1].

1.4. MOUFANG SETS FROM SKEW-HERMITIAN FORMS

11

Following the same ideas as in [Bor66, Example 6.6(3)], we see that the root
groups can be described as follows. (See also [BT72b, (10.1.2)]. We are grateful
to T.N. Venkataramana for an enlightening discussion.) Let w := (1, 0, 0) ∈ ˆV , and
consider the partial ﬂag

0 ≤ hwi ≤ hwi⊥ ≤ ˆV.

(Notice that hwi⊥ = D ⊕ V ⊕ 0 ≤ ˆV .) The set of elements of U (ˆh) stabilizing this
partial ﬂag is a parabolic k-subgroup P of G. Its unipotent radical consists of the
elements of P acting trivially on hwi, on hwi⊥/hwi and on ˆV /hwi⊥.
αz,s : ˆV → ˆV : (a, v, b) 7→(cid:0)a + h(z, v) + sb, v + zb, b(cid:1).

For each element (z, s) ∈ U , consider the map

We claim that the unipotent radical of P consist precisely of these elements αz,s.
First, the elements αz,s are indeed contained in U (ˆh); this is an easy computation,
using the fact that h(z, z) = s − sσ because (z, s) ∈ U . Next, the elements αz,s are
contained in the unipotent radical of P because they ﬁx w, stabilize w⊥, and act
trivially on both hwi⊥/hwi and ˆV /hwi⊥.
both hwi⊥/hwi and ˆV /hwi⊥ takes the form

Conversely, any element of P ﬁxing w, stabilizing w⊥ and acting trivially on

α : (a, v, b) 7→ (a + ϕ(v) + ψ(b), v + χ(b), b)

for some k-linear maps ϕ : V → D, ψ : D → D and χ : D → V . Expressing that α
preserves ˆh then gives rise to the identities

h(χ(b), v) = bσϕ(v),

h(χ(b), χ(d)) = bσψ(d) − ψ(b)σd

for all v ∈ V and all b, d ∈ D.

Let z := χ(1) ∈ V and let s := ψ(1) ∈ D. Taking b = 1 in the ﬁrst identity
already gives ϕ(v) = h(z, v) for all v ∈ V . This same identity now takes the form
h(χ(b), v) = bσh(z, v) = h(zb, v) for all v ∈ V , and since h is non-degenerate, this
implies χ(b) = zb for all b ∈ D. The second identity now becomes bσh(z, z)d =
bσψ(d) − ψ(b)σd for all b, d ∈ D. Substituting b = 1 gives h(z, z)d = ψ(d) − sσd for
all d ∈ D. Setting in addition d = 1 shows that h(z, z) = s − sσ, and substituting
this back in the previous equation then implies that ψ(d) = sd for all d ∈ D. We
conclude that (z, s) ∈ U and α = αz,s.
The elements of the Moufang set of G, i.e. the minimal k-parabolics of G,
correspond precisely to the D-equivalence classes of isotropic elements w ∈ ˆV (i.e.
those w ∈ ˆV for which ˆh(w, w) = 0); so two elements of ˆV are equivalent if and
only if they can be obtained from each other by right multiplication by a non-zero
element of D. Let ∞ be the element of X represented by (1, 0, 0) ∈ ˆV , and for every
(v, a) ∈ U , we will denote the corresponding element of X by [v, a], represented by
(Observe that ˆh(cid:0)(a, v, 1), (a, v, 1)(cid:1) = aσ − a + h(v, v) = 0.)

For every (z, s) ∈ U , we now deﬁne a permutation αz,s of X given by

(a, v, 1) ∈ ˆV.

(1.5)

αz,s(a, v, b) :=(cid:0)a + h(z, v) + sb, v + zb, b(cid:1),

12

1. MOUFANG SETS

and similarly a permutation γz,s of X given by

(1.6)

We now set

γz,s(a, v, b) :=(cid:0)a, v + za, b − h(z, v) − sa(cid:1).

U∞ := {αz,s | (z, s) ∈ U}, U0 := {γz,s | (z, s) ∈ U}.

We now show that U∞ and U0 coincide with the root groups of M(h). Fix some

(z, s) ∈ U . Let (v, a) ∈ U be arbitrary; then αz,s maps [v, a] to

where the sum (v, a) + (z, s) denotes the group operation of U . (We have slightly
abused notation in passing from a class to a representative.) Similarly,

[v, a]αz,s = αz,s(a, v, 1) =(cid:0)a + h(z, v) + s, v + z, 1(cid:1) = [(v, a) + (z, s)],
[v, a]γz,s = γz,s(a, v, 1) =(cid:0)a, v + za, 1 − h(z, v) − sa(cid:1)

=(cid:2)(v + za)(cid:0)1 − h(z, v) − sa(cid:1)−1

, a(cid:0)1 − h(z, v) − sa(cid:1)−1(cid:3).

On the other hand, the corresponding map in the Moufang set M(h) is given by

[v, a]γz,s = [v, a]τ −1αz,sτ

= [va−1,−a−1]αz,sτ
=(cid:2)va−1 + z, −a−1 + h(z, va−1) + s(cid:3)τ
=(cid:2)(va−1 + z)a(cid:0)1 − h(z, v) − sa(cid:1)−1

and we see that both formulas coincide.

, a(cid:0)1 − h(z, v) − sa(cid:1)−1(cid:3),

(cid:3)

Remark 1.4.4. Alternatively, we could have computed the µ-map correspond-
ing to the element (0, 1) ∈ U directly from (1.5) and (1.6). (Notice that (0, 1) ∈ U
because 1 ∈ Dσ.) By the uniqueness of the µ-maps, it suﬃces to ﬁnd elements
(z, s) and (y, t) in U such that the composition γz,sα0,1γy,t swaps 0 (i.e., (0, 0, 1))
and ∞ (i.e., (1, 0, 0)). We get (z, s) = (y, t) = (0, 1), so

µ0,1 = γ0,1α0,1γ0,1,

and we see that µ0,1 maps an element (a, v, b) ∈ ˆV to (b, v,−a). Hence

[v, a]µ0,1 = (a, v, 1)µ0,1 = (1, v,−a) ∼ (−a−1,−va−1, 1) = [−va−1,−a−1]

and we recover the expected formula for τ .

Corollary 1.4.5. Let M be a Moufang set arising from a classical

linear
algebraic group of k-rank one over some ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, and assume
that the root groups of M are non-abelian. Then there exists a skew ﬁeld D with
involution σ, a non-trivial right D-module V , and an anisotropic skew-hermitian
form h : V × V → D, such that M ∼= M(D, σ, V, h).

Proof. By [BT87, Section 1.1], every classical linear algebraic group over
some ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2 is isogenous to either SLn(D) for some ﬁnite-
dimensional skew ﬁeld D with center k, or to SU(h) for some ﬁnite-dimensional
skew ﬁeld D with involution σ, some non-trivial ﬁnite-dimensional right D-mod-
ule V , and some sesquilinear hermitian or skew-hermitian form h which is non-
degenerate and trace-valued. The condition to be trace-valued is always satisﬁed
when char(k) 6= 2. Moreover, by [BT87, Remark 1.8(2)], we may assume that h
is skew-hermitian provided D 6= k. Notice that when D = k, we have σ = 1 and

1.4. MOUFANG SETS FROM SKEW-HERMITIAN FORMS

13

a hermitian form is just a symmetric bilinear form and hence SU(h) is, in fact, an
orthogonal group SO(h).

Assume now that M is a Moufang set arising from a classical linear algebraic
group G of k-rank one over some ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, and assume that the
root groups of M are non-abelian. Since SL2(D) and the orthogonal groups have a
Moufang set with abelian root groups, we may assume that G = SU(h) for some
non-degenerate skew-hermitian form h of Witt index 1. Let han be the anisotropic
part of h. It now follows from Theorem 1.4.3 that M(G) ∼= M(han). Finally, notice
that the underlying vector space Van is non-trivial because the root groups are
assumed to be non-abelian.

CHAPTER 2

Structurable algebras

Structurable algebras have been introduced by Bruce Allison in 1978 [All78].
His main motivation was to construct exceptional Lie algebras, by generalizing
the Tits–Kantor–Koecher construction, which constructs Lie algebras from Jordan
algebras.

2.1. Deﬁnitions and basic properties

Structurable algebras are algebras equipped with an involution and triple prod-
uct. This triple product is in some sense of more importance than the multiplication
of the algebra, in the same spirit as the operators in Jordan algebras are more im-
portant than the actual multiplication in their classical deﬁnition. Structurable
algebras can only be deﬁned over ﬁelds of characteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3.

Definition 2.1.1. A structurable algebra over a ﬁeld k of characteristic not 2

or 3 is a ﬁnite-dimensional, unital k-algebra with involution1 (A,¯) such that
(2.1)
for x, y, z, w ∈ A, where the left hand side denotes the Lie bracket of the two
operators, and where

[Vx,y, Vz,w] = V{x,y,z},w − Vz,{y,x,w}

(This deﬁnition of Vx,yz should be compared with identity (1.4).)

Vx,yz := {x y z} := (xy)z + (zy)x − (zx)y.

For all x, y, z ∈ A, we write Ux,yz := Vx,zy and Uxy := Ux,xy. We will refer
to the maps Vx,y ∈ Endk(A) as V -operators, and to the maps Ux,y ∈ Endk(A) and
Ux ∈ Endk(A) as U -operators. The trilinear map (x, y, z) 7→ {x y z} is called the
triple product of the structurable algebra.

Structurable algebras are not necessarily associative nor commutative; they are
generalizations of both associative algebras with involution and Jordan algebras. In
particular, the structurable algebras with trivial involution are exactly the Jordan
algebras; see section 2.3.2 below.

In [All78] and [All79], a structurable algebra is deﬁned as an algebra with

involution such that

(2.2)
for all x, y, z ∈ A with Tx := Vx,1. The equivalence of (2.1) and (2.2) follows from
[All79, Corollary 5.(v)].

[Tz, Vx,y] =VTz x,y − Vx,Tz y

1In our context, an involution will always be a k-linear map of order at most two such that
xy = y x. Notice in particular that we do not consider involutions that do not ﬁx the ground ﬁeld
k, i.e. our involutions are always “of the ﬁrst kind”.

2. STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

Definition 2.1.2. Let (A,¯) be a structurable algebra; then A = H ⊕ S for

H = {h ∈ A | h = h} and S = {s ∈ A | s = −s}.

The elements of H are called hermitian elements, the elements of S are called
skew-hermitian elements or brieﬂy skew elements. The dimension of S is called the
skew-dimension of A.

Skew elements tend to behave ‘nicer’ than arbitrary elements of the structurable

algebra.

As usual, the commutator and the associator are deﬁned as
[x, y, z] = (xy)z − x(yz),

[x, y] = xy − yx,

for all x, y, z ∈ A. For each s ∈ S, we deﬁne the operator Ls : A → A by

Lsx := sx.

The following map is of crucial importance in the study of structurable algebras:

ψ : A × A → S : (x, y) 7→ xy − yx.
A structurable algebra (A,¯) is skew-alternative, i.e.,
[s, x, y] = −[x, s, y] = [x, y, s]

(2.3)
for all s ∈ S and all x, y ∈ A; see [All78, Proposition 1]. This implies that
(2.4)

[s, s, x] = [x, s, s] = [s, x, s] = 0,
s[t, s, x] = −[s, ts, x],

(2.5)
for all s, t ∈ S and all x ∈ A. The identities (2.5) are weak versions of two of the
well-known Moufang identities for alternative division rings.

[x, s, t]s = −[x, st, s].

We list some more identities. For all x, y ∈ A and s ∈ S, we have

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

Ux,y − Uy,x = Lψ(x,y),
Vx,sy − Vy,sx = −Lψ(x,y)Ls,
sψ(x, y)s = −ψ(sx, sy),
LsUx,yLs = −Usx,sy.

Identity (2.6) follows from the deﬁnition of the U -operator; (2.7) is shown in
[All79, Lemma 2]; (2.8) is [AH81, Lemma 11.2]; (2.9) is [AH81, Proposition 11.3].

Definition 2.1.3. An ideal of A is a two-sided ideal stabilized by . A struc-
turable algebra (A, ) is simple if its only ideals are {0} and A, and it is called
central if its center

Z(A, ) = Z(A) ∩ H

= {c ∈ A | [c,A] = [c,A,A] = [A, c,A] = [A,A, c] = 0} ∩ H

is equal to k1. The radical of A is the largest solvable2 ideal of A. A structurable
algebra is semisimple if its radical is zero.

2An ideal I is solvable if there exists a k ∈ N such that I 2k

= 1.

2.3. EXAMPLES OF STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

17

If char(k) 6= 2, 3, 5, a semisimple structurable algebra is the direct sum of simple
structurable algebras (see [Sch85, Section 2] for the characteristic zero case and
[Smi92, Section 2] for the general case).
If char(k) = 0, [Sch85, Theorem 10]
states that if A is a structurable algebra with radical R, there exists a semisimple
structurable subalgebra B ≤ A such that A = B ⊕ R.

2.2. Conjugate invertibility in structurable algebras

For structurable algebras there is a notion of invertibility that generalizes the

notion of invertibility from Jordan algebras.

Definition 2.2.1. Let (A, ) be a structurable algebra. An element u ∈ A is

said to be conjugate invertible if there exists an element ˆu ∈ A such that
(2.10)

Vu,ˆu = id, or equivalently, Vˆu,u = id.

If u is conjugate invertible, then the element ˆu is uniquely determined, and is called
the conjugate inverse of u. For long expressions we will also use the notation

If u is conjugate invertible, the operator Uu is invertible and we have

u∧ := ˆu = bu.

(2.11)

see [AH81, Section 6].

ˆu = U −1

u u;

If each element in A\{0} is conjugate invertible, A is called a conjugate division
algebra or simply a structurable division algebra. Clearly, every structurable division
algebra is simple.

If A is an associative algebra with involution and u ∈ A is invertible, then

ˆu = u−1; this motivates the term “conjugate inverse”.

For skew elements, a more elegant criterion for conjugate invertibility exists:
an element s ∈ S is conjugate invertible if and only if Ls is invertible. If s ∈ S is
conjugate invertible, we have

ˆs = −L−1

s 1 ∈ S;
LˆsLs = LsLˆs = −id;

(2.13)
see [AH81, Proposition 11.1]. Note that sˆs = ˆss = −1 for all s ∈ S.

The following formula (see [All86a, Proposition 2.6]) allows to determine the
conjugate inverse of any invertible element, provided that the conjugate inverse of
any invertible skew element can be determined. Let u ∈ A and s ∈ S be both
conjugate invertible; then ψ(u, Uu(su)) is conjugate invertible and

(2.12)

(2.14)

bu = 2(cid:0)ψ(u, Uu(su))(cid:1)∧

Uu(su).

2.3. Examples of structurable algebras

Central simple structurable algebras over ﬁelds of characteristic diﬀerent from

2, 3 and 5 are classiﬁed; they consist of six (non-disjoint) classes:

(1) central simple associative algebras with involution,
(2) central simple Jordan algebras,

18

2. STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

(3) structurable algebras constructed from a non-degenerate hermitian form over

a central simple associative algebra with involution,

(4) simple structurable algebras of skew-dimension 1; these are forms of certain

algebras constructed from a pair of Jordan algebras,

(5) forms of the tensor product of two composition algebras,
(6) an exceptional 35-dimensional case, which can be constructed from an octonion

algebra.

For the classes (4) and (5), we know in addition that there always exists a ﬁeld
extension which is at most quadratic such that the algebra becomes of the required
shape when the scalars are extended to this extension ﬁeld. See sections 2.3.4
and 2.3.5 below.

When the characteristic is zero the classiﬁcation was carried out by Allison
in [All78], but in that paper class (6) was overlooked. The classiﬁcation was
completed and generalized to ﬁelds of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, 3 and 5 by
Smirnov in [Smi92].

Below we describe classes (1)–(5) and give some speciﬁc properties of each class;
in particular, we will investigate in which cases we obtain structurable division
algebras. This turns out to be a challenging question, and in fact, for the classes
(4) and (5), no complete answer is known. Since there are no division algebras
in class (6), we do not describe it explicitly but refer the interested reader to
[Smi90] and [AF93] instead. Although we deﬁned structurable algebras to be
ﬁnite-dimensional algebras, the examples (1), (2), (3) can of course also be deﬁned
in the inﬁnite-dimensional case.

2.3.1. Associative algebras with involution. Let (A, ) be an associative
algebra with involution. Then A is a structurable algebra; see [All78, Example 8.i]
or [Sch85, p. 411]. An element u ∈ A is conjugate invertible if and only if it is
invertible in the usual associative sense, and in this case ˆu = u−1. In particular, A
is a structurable division algebra if and only if it is a division algebra in the usual
sense.

2.3.2. Jordan algebras. Let A be a Jordan algebra and let = id. In this
case the V -operator of structurable algebras is equal to the V -operator of Jordan
algebras; see (1.4). The deﬁning identity of structurable algebras is a known identity
in the theory of Jordan algebras; see, for example, [McC04, p. 202, (FFV)’].

Moreover, each structurable algebra with trivial involution (equivalently, of
skew-dimension zero) is indeed a Jordan algebra; see [All78, p.135, Remark (ii)]).
It is now easy to check that an element u ∈ A is conjugate invertible if and
only if it is invertible in the Jordan algebra, and ˆu = u−1. In particular, A is a
structurable division algebra if and only if it is a Jordan division algebra.

2.3.3. Hermitian structurable algebras. This class of structurable alge-

bras is constructed from a hermitian space.

Definition 2.3.1. Let (E,¯) be a unital associative algebra over a ﬁeld k with
a k-linear involution . Let W be a unital left E-module, and let h : W × W → E
be a hermitian form, i.e. a k-bilinear form such that h(αv, βw) = αh(v, w)β and
h(v, w) = h(w, v) for all v, w ∈ W and all α, β ∈ E.

2.3. EXAMPLES OF STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

19

It is shown in [All78, Section 8.(iii)] that A := E ⊕ W is a structurable algebra

with the following involution and multiplication:

e + w = e + w,

(e1 + w1)(e2 + w2) = (e1e2 + h(w2, w1)) + (e2w1 + e1w2),

for all e, e1, e2 ∈ E and all w, w1, w2 ∈ W .

It is clear that S = {e ∈ E | e = −e}. After some calculations we ﬁnd that

(2.15)

ψ(e1 + w1, e2 + w2) = (e1e2 − e2e1) − (h(w1, w2) − h(w1, w2)),

Ve1+w1,e2+w2(e3 + w3) =

(e1e2 + h(w1, w2))e3 + (e1e2 + h(w1, w2))w3
+ (e3e2 + h(w3, w2))e1 + (e3e2 + h(w3, w2))w1
+ (−e3e1 + h(w3, w1))e2 + (e3e1 − h(w3, w1))w2,

(2.16)
for all e1, e2, e3 ∈ E, w1, w2, w3 ∈ W .

By [All86b, Proposition 4.1], the structurable algebra A = E ⊕ W is cen-
tral simple if and only if E is central simple, dim(E) dim(W ) 6= 1 and h is non-
degenerate; moreover, e+w ∈ E⊕W is conjugate invertible if and only if ee−h(w, w)
is invertible in E, and in this case the conjugate inverse is given by

(2.17)
In particular, if e ∈ S is conjugate invertible, then ˆe = −e−1.

\e + w = (ee − h(w, w))−1(e − w).

Lemma 2.3.2. The hermitian structurable algebra A = E ⊕ W is a structurable
division algebra if and only if E is a division algebra and for all 0 6= w ∈ W we
have h(w, w) 6= 0, 1.

Proof. This follows immediately from (2.17), since h(w, w) = ee if and only
(cid:3)

if h(e−1w, e−1w) = 1 when e 6= 0.

2.3.4. Structurable algebras of skew-dimension one. Structurable alge-
bras of skew-dimension one are, among the structurable algebras, closest to Jordan
algebras, and they have interesting connections with so-called Freudenthal triple
systems.
In [All90b] and [AF84], this type of structurable algebras has been
studied; we will collect some of these results, which we will need later.

In this section A is a structurable algebra of skew-dimension one. We ﬁx a
non-zero element s0 ∈ S, so S = ks0. By [AF84, Lemma 2.1], s2
0 = µ1 for some
µ ∈ k∗, therefore s0(s0x) = (xs0)s0 = µx; it is also shown that a simple structurable
algebra of skew-dimension one is always central.

If A is simple, then the bilinear map ψ is non-degenerate (see [AF84, Lemma 2.2]).

Deﬁne the quartic form ν : A → k given by
(2.18)

ν(x) =

1
6µ

ψ(x, Ux(s0x))s0,

by identifying k1 with k. It is easy to see that ν(1) = 1 and that ν is independent
of the choice of s0. This map plays the role of the norm of A, in a way that can be
made explicit; see [AF92, Proposition 5.4].

20

2. STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

By [AF84, Proposition 2.11], an element x ∈ A is conjugate invertible if and

only if ν(x) 6= 0. When this is the case, we have

s0Ux(s0x).

ˆx = −

3µν(x)

In particular, A is a structurable division algebra if and only if the quartic form ν
is anisotropic.

We will now discuss an important class of structurable algebras of skew-dimension

one, which we will call structurable matrix algebras. The multiplication of these al-
gebras is similar to the multiplication of split octonions when represented by Zorn
matrices.

Definition 2.3.3. Let J be a Jordan algebra over a ﬁeld k, let T : J × J → k
be a symmetric bilinear form, let × : J × J → J be a symmetric bilinear map, and
let N : J → k be a cubic form such that one of the following holds:
(i) J is a cubic Jordan algebra with a non-degenerate admissible form N , with
basepoint 1, trace form T , and Freudenthal cross product ×; see, for instance,
[KMRT98, §38].
(ii) J is a Jordan algebra of a non-degenerate quadratic form q with basepoint 1,

and T is the linearization of q. In this case, N and × are the zero maps.

(iii) J = 0, and the maps N , T and × are the zero maps. In this case, J is not

The following proposition explains the importance of structurable matrix alge-

bras.

Proposition 2.3.4 ([AF84, Prop. 4.5]). Let A be a structurable algebra of
0 = µ1. Then A is isomorphic to a structurable matrix

skew-dimension one with s2
algebra M (J, η) if and only if µ is a square in k.

Corollary 2.3.5. Let A be a structurable algebra of skew-dimension one.
Then there exists a ﬁeld extension E/k of degree at most 2 such that A ⊗k E
is isomorphic to a structurable matrix algebra over E.

The algebras in classes (1) and (3) on page 17 have skew-dimension 1 if and

only if the associative algebra with involution has skew-dimension 1.

Remark 2.3.6. It follows by combining Proposition 4.4 and Theorem 4.11 from
[All90b] that A is a form of a structurable matrix algebra with N = 0 if and only
if A is isomorphic to a structurable algebra of a non-degenerate hermitian form
over a 2-dimensional composition algebra; in this case the conjugate degree of the
algebra is equal to 2.

In all other cases, the conjugate degree of A is 4 and the quartic form ν deﬁned

in (2.18) is the conjugate norm of A.

It is an open problem to determine explicitly all structurable algebras of skew-
dimension one; see also Remark 2.3.10 below. Examples of structurable algebras
of skew-dimension one that are not isomorphic to structurable matrix algebras can
be obtained by applying a Cayley–Dickson process to a certain class of Jordan
algebras. We will now brieﬂy explain this process, and we refer to [AF84] for more
details.

The Cayley–Dickson process for structurable algebras. In order to obtain a
structurable algebra, we start from a Jordan algebra equipped with a Jordan norm
of degree 4.

Definition 2.3.7. Let J be a Jordan algebra over k. A form Q : J → k of

degree 4 is a Jordan norm of degree 4 if:
(i) 1 ∈ J is a basepoint of Q, i.e. Q(1) = 1;
(ii) Q(Ujj′) = Q(j)2Q(j′) for all j, j′ ∈ J ⊗k K for all ﬁeld extensions K/k;
(iii) The trace form

T : J × J → k : (j, j′) 7→ Q(1; j)Q(1; j′) − Q(1; j, j′)

is a k-bilinear non-degenerate form.

The main examples of Jordan algebras with a Jordan norm of degree 4 are
separable Jordan algebras of degree 4 with their generic norm and separable Jordan
algebras of degree 2 with the square of their generic norm. In [All90b, Proposition
5.1] Jordan norms of degree 4 are classiﬁed.

If J is a separable Jordan algebra of degree 4, it is shown in [AF84, Theorem
5.4] that the space J0 = {x ∈ J | T (x, 1) = 0} can be given the structure of a
separable Jordan algebra of degree 3 and thus of a cubic Jordan algebra.

Definition 2.3.8. Let J be a Jordan algebra with Q a Jordan norm of degree 4

with trace T . Consider the k-linear bijection θ on J given by

bθ = −b + 1

2 T (b, 1)1,

for all b ∈ J; observe that θ2 = 1.

Let µ ∈ k∗, and deﬁne the algebra CD(J, Q, µ) := J ⊕ s0J, with multiplication

and involution given by

θ
(j1 + s0j2)(j3 + s0j4) = j1j3 + µ(j2jθ

for all j1, j2, j3, j4 ∈ J. By [AF84, Theorem 6.6], this is a simple structurable
algebra with skew-dimension one and S = ks0.

22

2. STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

Since (ts0)2 = t2µ, it follows from Proposition 2.3.4 that the structurable alge-
bra CD(J, Q, µ) is isomorphic to a structurable matrix algebra if and only if µ is a
square in k.

This procedure can be used to construct structurable division algebras of skew-

dimension one.

Lemma 2.3.9 ([AF84, Theorem 7.1]). Let J be a Jordan division k-algebra
with Jordan norm of degree 4. Deﬁne the ﬁeld E = k(ξ) with ξ transcendental over
k, let J ′ = J ⊗k E and let Q′ be the extension of Q to J ′. Then CD(J ′, Q′, ξ) is a
central simple structurable division algebra over k.

Remark 2.3.10. It is a major open problem whether every structurable divi-
sion algebra of skew-dimension one is either a hermitian structurable algebra or is
obtained from a Cayley–Dickson process on a Jordan division algebra with a Jor-
dan norm of degree 4. To the best of our knowledge, this is not known, and we
have been told by Skip Garibaldi that there seem to be strong indications that not
all structurable division algebras of skew-dimension one are of this form. See also
section 6.4 for the relevance of this question to our results.

2.3.5. Forms of the tensor product of two composition algebras. For
the ﬁrst part of this section we allow the characteristic of k to be equal to 3, but
we still demand that it is diﬀerent from 2.

Definition 2.3.11. Let C1 and C2 be two composition algebras over k (possibly
of diﬀerent dimension) with involution σ1 and σ2, respectively. Let m1 := dimk(C1)
and m2 := dimk(C2). Let A = C1 ⊗k C2, equipped with the involution

= σ := σ1 ⊗ σ2.
Then we call (A, ) an (m1, m2)-product algebra.

If char(k) 6= 2, 3, it is shown in [All78, Section 8.(iv)] that (A, ) is a struc-

turable algebra.

Definition 2.3.12. A k-algebra A is a form of the tensor product of two com-
position algebras if there exists a ﬁeld extension E/k and two composition algebras
C1, C2 over E such that A ⊗k E ∼= C1 ⊗E C2.

These algebras were ﬁrst studied in [All88] by Allison, under the assumption
that the base ﬁeld has characteristic zero. As pointed out in [AF92], most results
remain valid in general characteristic diﬀerent from 2 (although loc. cit. still ex-
cludes characteristic 3), and in particular, there is a complete classiﬁcation of the
forms of the tensor products of two composition algebras; see Proposition 2.3.14
below. We ﬁrst give the deﬁnition which is required to describe the structure of
these forms.

Definition 2.3.13 ([All88, p. 671]). Let C be a composition algebra C of
dimension m over a quadratic extension E/k. Let Gal(E/k) = hσi and deﬁne
the composition algebra σC over E that has the same addition, multiplication and
involution as C, but with scalar multiplication t · x := σ(t)x for all t ∈ E and
x ∈ σC.

σC, equipped with the usual involution
Let B be the E-algebra B = C ⊗E
:= ⊗ . Now deﬁne an automorphism τ : B → B : x ⊗ y 7→ y ⊗ x, and let

from B. Then
A = {x ∈ B | τ (x) = x}, equipped with the restriction of
(A, ) is a form of (B, ), and is called a twisted (m, m)-product algebra, denoted
by cE/k(C, ). By [All88, p. 671], such an algebra is indeed structurable (in
characteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3).

By [All88, Proposition 2.2], the (m1, m2)-product algebras and the twisted

(m, m)-product algebras are central simple, except for (m1, m2) = (2, 2) and (m, m) =
(2, 2). Each (twisted) (m1, m2)-product algebra for m1, m2 ≤ 4 is associative and
each (8, 1)- or (8, 2)-product algebra is alternative. Notice that an (8, 2)-product is
essentially an octonion algebra over a quadratic extension E/k, but equipped with
an involution that is not E-linear.

Proposition 2.3.14 ([All88, Th. 2.1] and [AF92, Proposition 7.9]). If a
k-algebra A is a form of the tensor product of two composition algebras, then either
A is isomorphic to the tensor product of two composition algebras over k, or A is
isomorphic to a twisted (m, m)-product algebra for some m > 1, and in this case,
there is a quadratic extension E/k such that A ⊗k E is isomorphic to the tensor
product of two composition algebras over E.

Let C1 and C2 be two composition algebras with involution σ1 and σ2 and

norm form q1 and q2, respectively. Let Si be the set of skew elements in Ci, i.e.

Si = {x ∈ Ci | xσi = −x}.

Let C1 ⊗k C2 be a (m1, m2)-product algebra equipped with the involution =

σ := σ1 ⊗ σ2. It follows that the set of skew elements in C1 ⊗k C2 is equal to

S = {x ∈ C1 ⊗k C2 | x := xσ = −x} = (S1 ⊗ 1) ⊕ (1 ⊗ S2);

observe that dimk S = dimk C1 + dimk C2 − 2.

Definition 2.3.15.

(i) We will associate a quadratic form qA to C1 ⊗k C2,

called the Albert form, by setting

qA : S → k : (s1 ⊗ 1) + (1 ⊗ s2) 7→ q1(s1) − q2(s2)

for all s1 ∈ S1 and s2 ∈ S2. We have qA ⊥ H = q1 ⊥ (−1)q2 and when we
denote q′
1 ⊥
h−1iq′
2.

i = qi|Si for the pure part of the Pﬁster form qi, we have qA = q′

(ii) For each s = s1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ s2 ∈ S, we deﬁne

(s1 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ s2)♮ = s1 ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ s2.

(iii) Let s ∈ S such that qA(s) 6= 0. Then we say that s is invertible and deﬁne

the inverse of s by

s−1 := −

1

qA(s)

s♮.

The Albert form was introduced by A. A. Albert in the case where C1 and C2

are both quaternion algebras.

Tensor products of two composition algebras are far from being associative or
alternative, but (as usual) the skew elements behave more nicely than arbitrary
elements:

(ii) (s1s2s1)x = s1(s2(s1x));
(iii) If s is invertible then s(s−1x) = s−1(sx) = x.

Proof. These identities can be easily veriﬁed using the well-known properties
(cid:3)

of composition algebras.

In the case that both C1 and C2 are quaternion algebras, C1⊗k C2 is associative;
Albert proved that C1 ⊗k C2 is a division algebra if and only if its Albert form is
anisotropic (see [Lam05, Theorem III.4.8].) It is not obvious to generalize this
result to arbitrary composition algebras. The proof of the following theorem makes
use of the Lie algebra associated to the structurable algebra constructed in section
2.4.

Theorem 2.3.17 ([All86b, Theorem 5.1] ). Let char(k) = 0 and A a (twisted)
(8, m2)-product algebra. Then A is a structurable division algebra if and only if the
Albert form on S is anisotropic.

Remark 2.3.18. It seems plausible that this result can be generalized to arbi-
trary ﬁelds of characteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3, but the method used in Allison’s
proof cannot be generalized. One implication is easy: if A is a structurable divi-
sion algebra, then in particular all elements of S are conjugate invertible, and
Lemma 2.3.16 together with Deﬁnition 2.3.15(iii) implies that qA is anisotropic.

For (8, m2)-product algebras with m2 ∈ {1, 2, 4}, the converse does indeed hold;
this can be shown by explicitly constructing an element s0 = 1 ⊗ s2 ∈ S \ {0} such
that qA(ψ(x, xs0)) 6= 0 and invoking [AF92, Theorem 8.7]. The question remains
open for (8, 8)-product algebras and for twisted (8, 8)-product algebras.

Remark 2.3.19.

(i) In [AF92], it is shown that the conjugate degree (i.e.
the degree of the conjugate norm) of a (twisted) (8, m)-product algebra is
equal to 2, 4, 4 or 8 for m = 1, 2, 4, 8, respectively.

(ii) In an entirely diﬀerent context, the authors of [HT98] study Albert forms of
the (twisted) tensor product of two octonion algebras. In [HT98, Theorem
2.1] it is mentioned that every anisotropic 14-dimensional quadratic form with
trivial discriminant and trivial Cliﬀord invariant is the Albert form of a twisted
tensor product of two octonion algebras. They also show the existence of
quadratic forms that are the Albert form of a twisted tensor product of two
octonion algebras, but that are not similar to the Albert form of a non-twisted
tensor product of two octonion algebras; these are certain quadratic forms over
ﬁelds that do not satisfy a condition called “D(14)” in [HT98].

2.4. Construction of Lie algebras from structurable algebras

In this section, we will recall the Tits–Kantor–Koecher construction of the Lie
algebra K(A) associated to any structurable algebra A. This Lie algebra will play
a crucial role to make the connection with linear algebraic groups (see section 4
below).

In order to describe the construction, we need to introduce some more concepts;
we give a brief summary of [All79]. We continue to assume that A is a structurable

2.4. CONSTRUCTION OF LIE ALGEBRAS FROM STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

algebra with involution σ : A → A : x 7→ x, and we let End(A) be the ring of k-linear
maps from A to A. For each A ∈ End(A), we deﬁne new k-linear maps

Aǫ = A − LA(1)+A(1),
Aδ = A + RA(1),

where Lx and Rx denote left and right multiplication by an element x ∈ A, respec-
tively. One can verify that

(2.20)

V ǫ
x,y = −Vy,x,
V δ
x,y(s) = −ψ(x, sy),

(2.21)
for all x, y ∈ A and s ∈ S. Deﬁne the Lie subalgebra Strl(A, ) of End(A) as
(2.22)

Strl(A, ) = {A ∈ End(A) | [A, Vx,y] = VAx,y + Vx,Aǫy}.

(This deﬁnition follows from [All78, Corollary 5].) It follows from the deﬁnition of
structurable algebras that Vx,y ∈ Strl(A, ), so we can deﬁne the Lie subalgebra

Instrl(A, ) = Span{Vx,y | x, y ∈ A},

which is, in fact, an ideal of Strl(A, ). Notice that for all s, t ∈ S, we have
LsLt ∈ Instrl(A), since it follows from (2.3) that
2 (Vst,1 − Vs,t) = 1
(2.23)

2 (V1,ts − Vs,t).

LsLt = 1

It follows from skew-alternativity and the deﬁnition of δ and ǫ that

(2.24)

(LrLt)ǫ = −LtLr,

(2.25)
for all r, t, s ∈ S. For all A ∈ Strl(A, ) we have a version of triality for endomor-
phisms:

(LrLt)δ(s) = s(tr) + r(ts)

A(sx) = Aδ(s)x + sAǫ(x)

for all x ∈ A, s ∈ S.

(2.26)
By [All79, Lemma 1], we have for all A ∈ Strl(A, ) and x, y ∈ A that
(2.27)
For all A ∈ Strl(A, ), the map A 7→ Aǫ is a Lie algebra automorphism of Strl(A, )
of order 2; the map A 7→ Aδ|S is a Lie algebra homomorphism from Strl(A, ) into
Endk(S).

Aδψ(x, y) = ψ(Ax, y) + ψ(x, Ay).

It follows that A⊕S is a Strl(A, )-module under the action A(x, s) = (Ax, Aδs)

for all A ∈ Strl(A, ) and (x, s) ∈ A ⊕ S.

Definition 2.4.1. Consider two copies A+ and A− of A with corresponding
isomorphisms A → A+ : x 7→ x+ and A → A− : x 7→ x−, and let S+ ⊂ A+ and
S− ⊂ A− be the corresponding subspaces of skew elements. Let

K(A) = S− ⊕ A− ⊕ Instrl(A) ⊕ A+ ⊕ S+

as a vector space; as in [All79, §3], we make K(A) into a Lie algebra by extending
the Lie algebra structure of Instrl(A) as follows:
• [Instrl, K(A)]

[Va,b, Va′,b′ ] = V{a,b,a′},b′ − Va′,{b,a,b′}∈ Instrl(A),

[s+, t−] := LsLt ∈ Instrl(A),

[t−, t′

−] := 0,

for all x, x′, y, y′ ∈ A, all s, s′, t, t′ ∈ S, and all Va,b, Va′,b′ ∈ Instrl(A).

From the deﬁnition of the Lie bracket we clearly see that the Lie algebra K(A)

has a 5-grading given by K(A)j = 0 for all |j| > 2 and

K(A)−2 = S−, K(A)−1 = A−, K(A)0 = Instrl(A),

K(A)1 = A+, K(A)2 = S+.

In the case where A is a Jordan algebra, we have S = 0, and thus the Lie alge-
bra K(A) has a 3-grading; in this case K(A) is exactly the Tits–Kantor–Koecher
construction of a Lie algebra from a Jordan algebra (see, for example, [Jac68,
Section VIII.5]).

It is shown in [All79, §5] that the structurable algebra A is simple if and only
if K(A) is a simple Lie algebra, and that A is central if and only if K(A) is central.
The following strong result motivates the construction of structurable algebras.

Theorem 2.4.2 ([All79, Theorem 4 and 10]). Let L be a simple Lie algebra
over a ﬁeld k of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, 3 and 5. We deﬁne the following
condition on L:
(⋆) L contains an sl2-triple3 {e, f, h} such that L is the direct sum of an arbitrary
number of irreducible sl2-modules over this triple of highest weight 0, 2 or 4.
Then L ∼= K(A) for some simple structurable algebra A if and only if L satisﬁes (⋆).
When char(k) = 0, the condition (⋆) on L is fulﬁlled if and only if L is isotropic,

i.e. contains a non-trivial split toral subalgebra (see [Sel76]).

The following result is particularly relevant for our purposes.

3A triple {e, f, h} is called an sl2-triple if [e, f ] = h, [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = −2f; such a triple

spans an sl2 Lie subalgebra.

2.4. CONSTRUCTION OF LIE ALGEBRAS FROM STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

27

Theorem 2.4.3 ([All86b, Theorem 3.1]). Let char(k) = 0, and let A be a
central simple structurable algebra. Then K(A) has relative rank 1 if and only if A
is a structurable division algebra.

Moreover, each central simple Lie algebra of relative rank 1 can be obtained in

this way.

One of the goals of the current paper is to prove a similar result for linear
algebraic groups (over ﬁelds of arbitrary characteristic diﬀerent from 2 or 3). We
refer to Theorems 4.1.1 and 4.3.1 below.

We now give a brief overview of the various types of simple Lie algebras that can
be obtained starting from central simple structurable algebras. When char(k) = 0,
we mention, in view of the previous theorem, the Tits index (see Table 1 on page 8)
when the structurable algebra is division. Since our main goal is to understand
the exceptional cases, we do not go into detail about the classical types that are
obtained.
(1) If A is an associative algebra, then the corresponding Lie algebra is classical.
(2) Let A be a central simple Jordan algebra. Then K(A) is classical unless the
Jordan algebra is an exceptional Jordan algebra (i.e. an Albert algebra); in this
case, it is of type E7. If J is an Albert division algebra, then the corresponding
Lie algebra has Tits index E78

7,1; see also Example 1.3.5(ii).

sponding Lie algebra is classical.

(3) If A is a structurable algebra arising from a hermitian form, then the corre-
(4) Let A be of skew-dimension 1, thus A is a form of the algebra M (J, η) for
several possibilities of the Jordan algebra J as in Deﬁnition 2.3.3. If N = 0,
then A is isomorphic to a structurable algebra of hermitian form type by Re-
mark 2.3.6, and hence K(A) is classical. So assume that N 6= 0, and J is a
Jordan algebra of a non-degenerate cubic norm as in Deﬁnition 2.3.3(i). It fol-
lows from [Jac68, Theorem V.4,V.8 and V.9] that dimk J ∈ {1, 3, 6, 9, 15, 27}.
We get the following types of Lie algebras (at least in characteristic 0):

The known examples of structurable division algebras of this type arise from the
Cayley–Dickson process described in Deﬁnition 2.3.8, starting from a central
simple Jordan division algebra of degree 4. Such an algebra has dimension 10,
16 or 28, and the respective Tits indices of the Lie algebra K(A) are 2E35
6,1,
7,1 and E133
E66
8,1 , respectively (see [AF84, Example 7.2]), again assuming that
char(k) = 0.

(5) When C1, C2 are composition algebras, the Lie algebra K(C1 ⊗k C2) coincides
with the Lie algebra constructed from C1 and C2 using Tits’ second Lie algebra
construction, which is visualized in Freudenthal’s magic square (see [All88, p.
672]).

2.5. Isotopies of structurable algebras

Although isomorphisms of structurable algebras are well deﬁned, it turns out
that it is better to allow the unit element 1 to be mapped to a diﬀerent element.
This idea is encapsulated in the notion of an isotopy.

Definition 2.5.1 ([AH81, Section 8]). Two structurable algebras (A,¯) and
(A′,¯) over a ﬁeld k are isotopic if there exists a k-vector space isomorphism ψ : A →
A′ such that there exists a χ ∈ Homk(A,A′) such that

ψ(Vx,yz) = Vψ(x),χ(y)ψ(z) ∀x, y, z ∈ A.

The map ψ is then called an isotopy between (A,¯) and (A′,¯). The map χ is
completely determined by the map ψ; we call χ the inverse dual of ψ and denote
it by χ := ˆψ.

In this case, the map χ is again an isotopy, with inverse dual ψ; in particular,

ˆˆψ = ψ. Isotopy deﬁnes an equivalence relation on structurable algebras.

If ψ maps the identity of A to the identity of A′, then ψ is an isomorphism of

structurable algebras.

By [AF84, Lemma 1.20], if A and A′ are isotopic, then A is (central) simple

if and only if A′ is (central) simple.

The following theorem indicates why isotopy is a useful equivalence relation on

structurable algebras.

Theorem 2.5.2 ([AH81, Proposition 12.3]). Two structurable algebras A and
A′ are isotopic if and only if K(A) and K(A′) are graded-isomorphic graded Lie
algebras.

We collect some useful facts about isotopies. From [AH81, Proposition 11.3],

it follows that

Ls{x, y, z} = {Lsx, Lˆsy, Lsz}

(2.28)
for all x, y, z ∈ A and s ∈ S conjugate invertible. Therefore Ls is an isotopy with
cLs = Lˆs. Let u ∈ A be conjugate invertible and let α be an isotopy; then by
[AH81, Proposition 8.2],

(2.29)

cαu = ˆαˆu,

2.5. ISOTOPIES OF STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

29

and in particular if s ∈ S is conjugate invertible, then
(2.30)

csu = ˆsˆu.

If (A′,¯) is isotopic to (A,¯), there exists a conjugate invertible u ∈ A such that
(A′,¯) is isomorphic to a certain isotope of (A,¯), denoted by (A,¯)hui, which we
describe below.

Construction 2.5.3. Let u ∈ A be a conjugate invertible element. We
give the deﬁnition of the u-conjugate isotope Ahui of A following the approach
in [All86a, p. 364]; see [AH81, Section 7] for the original deﬁnition.

The algebra Ahui will be a structurable algebra with underlying vector space

A. Its involution is deﬁned by
(2.31)
We have τ hui2
respectively, for τ hui. Then

τ huix = ¯xhui = 2x − {x, u, ˆu} = x − ψ(x, ˆu)u.

= id, and we deﬁne Shui and Hhui as the (−1)- and 1-eigenspace,

moreover, one can show that Shui = Su.

Next, we deﬁne the operator Pu given by

A = Shui ⊕ Hhui;

(2.32)

Uu(5x − 2Vx,u ˆu).
This operator is invertible and has the following nice properties:

3 Uu(2τ hui + id)x =

Uu(su)

for all s ∈ S,

(2.36)

Pu{x, y, z} = {Pux, Pˆuy, Puz}

for all x, y, z ∈ A.
This last identity says that Pu is an isotopy on A with cPu = Pˆu.

Finally, if x, y ∈ A we can write x = su + a where s ∈ S and a ∈ Hhui, and we

deﬁne

(2.37)

xhuiy = (su + a)huiy = sPuy + Va,uy.

This deﬁnes a product on the vector space A. Then

(2.38)
is a unit for the product and τ hui is an involution for this product. We denote
the algebra with this product and involution τ hui by Ahui; this algebra is again
structurable.

1hui = ˆu

The V -operator of the algebra Ahui is given by

x,y z = {x, y, z}hui = {x, Puy, z},
V hui

for all x, y, z ∈ A. We denote by Lhui
ψhui(x, y) := Lhui

(1) Let A be an associative algebra with involution. It is shown in [All86a] that
two associative algebras are isotopic if and only if they are isomorphic. If u ∈ A
is invertible, Pu = Luu.
(2) Let A be a Jordan algebra. It follows from (2.31) and (2.37) that two Jordan
algebras are isotopic as Jordan algebras (see [Jac68, Section 12]) if and only if
they are isotopic as structurable algebras. If u ∈ A is invertible, Pu = Uu.

that are forms of an (m1, m2)-product algebra are isotopic if and only if their
respective Albert forms are similar.

In [All86a] it is shown that two alternative algebras are isotopic if and
only if they are isomorphic; in this case, Pu = Luu for every invertible element
u ∈ A.

CHAPTER 3

One-invertibility for structurable algebras

As we will see, the description of the Moufang sets arising from structurable
division algebras will rely on the notion of one-invertibility, introduced by Bruce
Allison and John Faulkner in the context of Kantor pairs [AF99], generalizing the
identically named concept for Jordan pairs. They explicitly proved a criterion for
one-invertibility (Theorem 3.2.13); this criterion allows us to explicitly compute the
left and right inverse of arbitrary non-zero elements in A × S when A is a division
algebra (Theorem 3.3.7 and Corollary 3.3.8).

In order to include the case char(k) = 5, we have to deal with the rather subtle
notion of algebraicity for structurable algebras and their corresponding 5-graded Lie
algebras. This is what we do in section 3.1; see also Remark 3.2.6 below. However,
we will see later that every structurable division algebra is automatically algebraic
(see Theorem 4.2.8), and this will allow us to state our results in section 5 for
arbitrary structurable division algebras over ﬁelds k with char(k) 6= 2, 3, without
having to be concerned about algebraicity any longer.

In section 3.2 we then deﬁne one-invertibility for elements in A × S, and in
section 3.3 we show that if A is an (algebraic) structurable division algebra, then
each element in (x, s) ∈ A × S \ {(0, 0)} is one-invertible. We are indebted to John
Faulkner for providing the main idea for the proof of this fact.

The results from this section will be used later in section 5 when we describe
the construction of Moufang sets from structurable division algebras and determine
the group U and permutation τ ; see Theorem 5.1.6 for the main result.

3.1. Algebraicity of 5-graded Lie algebras

In this section, we introduce the notion of an algebraic 5-graded Lie algebra; we
will then deﬁne an algebraic structurable algebra as an algebra such that the asso-
ciated graded Lie algebra K(A) is algebraic. It turns out that a simple structurable
algebra is associated to an algebraic k-group only if it satisﬁes the algebraicity con-
dition. This concept, as well as other constructions employed in the present section,
go back to [Sta09, Chapter 2], which, actually, deals with a more general case of
(2n + 1)-graded Lie algebras over commutative rings, and due to that is much more
technical.

Notation 3.1.1. Let L be a ﬁnite-dimensional 5-graded Lie algebra over a ﬁeld
k, char k 6= 2, 3. For any commutative k-algebra R and any (x, s) ∈ (L ⊗k R)σ ⊕

eσ(x, s) =

i!

ad(x + s)i ∈ EndR(L ⊗k R).

Definition 3.1.2. Let L be a ﬁnite-dimensional 5-graded Lie algebra over
k. The grading derivation on L is the derivation ζ ∈ Derk(L) such that for any
−2 ≤ i ≤ 2 and any x ∈ Li one has

ζ(x) = i · x for any −2 ≤ i ≤ 2 and any x ∈ Li.

If L contains an element ζ such that adζ is the grading derivation, we call ζ a
grading derivation of L by abuse of language.

Lemma 3.1.3. Let L be a ﬁnite-dimensional 5-graded Lie algebra over a ﬁeld k,

char k 6= 2, 3.
(i) Let R be a commutative associative unital k-algebra. For all x, y ∈ Lσ ⊗k R

and s, t ∈ L2σ ⊗k R we have

Then

[x, y]).

eσ : Uσ → GL(L),

(x, s) 7→ eσ(x, s),

is a homomorphism of algebraic k-groups.
ζ ∈ L, then this homomorphism is a closed embedding.
Proof.

(i) The statement follows immediately from a version of the Campbell–

If there is a grading derivation

Baker–Hausdorﬀ formula over an arbitrary commutative ring in which 6 is
invertible [AF99, Theorem 9], and the fact that L is 5-graded.
(ii) Clearly, eσ : Uσ → End(L) is a morphism of k-varieties. By (i) we have
If ζ exists, then
eσ(Uσ) ⊆ GL(L) and eσ is homomorphism of k-groups.
eσ(x, s)(ζ) = ζ − σx − 2σs, and hence eσ is universally injective. Then
by [DG70b, II, §5, Proposition 5.1] eσ is a closed embedding.
(cid:3)
Definition 3.1.4. Let L be a ﬁnite-dimensional 5-graded Lie algebra over a
ﬁeld k, char k 6= 2, 3. We say that L is algebraic, if for any (x, s) ∈ Lσ ⊕ L2σ the
endomorphism eσ(x, s) of L is a Lie algebra automorphism. We say that a (ﬁnite-
dimensional) structurable algebra A over k is algebraic, if K(A) is algebraic in the
above sense.

Remark 3.1.5. Lemma 3.1.7 below shows that any Jordan algebra over a ﬁeld
of characteristic 6= 2, 3 is algebraic, and any structurable algebra over a ﬁeld of
characteristic 6= 2, 3, 5 is algebraic. We will be able to prove later that every struc-
turable division algebra is algebraic, but this will require much more preparation;
see Theorem 4.2.8 below.

In fact, we do not know whether there exist central simple structurable algebras

that are not algebraic.

3.1. ALGEBRAICITY OF 5-GRADED LIE ALGEBRAS

33

Lemma 3.1.6. Let L be a ﬁnite-dimensional 5-graded Lie algebra over a ﬁeld
k, char k 6= 2, 3.
If L is algebraic, then for any commutative associative unital
k-algebra R and any (x, s) ∈ (L ⊗k R)σ ⊕ (L ⊗k R)2σ = (Lσ ⊕ L2σ) ⊗k R the
endomorphism

1
i!
of L ⊗k R is an R-Lie algebra automorphism.

eσ(x, s) =

4Xi=0

ad(x + s)i

Proof. Take any a ∈ (Lσ ⊕ L2σ) ⊗k R. Since eσ(a) is an R-linear endomor-

phism of L ⊗k R, in order to establish the claim it is enough to prove that
(3.3)
for any b ∈ Li, c ∈ Lj, −2 ≤ i, j ≤ 2. The formulas (3.1) of Lemma 3.1.3 imply
that, moreover, it is enough to prove (3.3) only for elements a = λa0, where a0 ∈ Lσ
or a0 ∈ L2σ and 0 6= λ ∈ R.

eσ(a)([b, c]) = [eσ(a)(b), eσ(a)(c)]

Assume ﬁrst R is a ﬁeld extension of k. Then λ is invertible. Consider the Lie
algebra automorphism φλ of L ⊗k R deﬁned by the formula φλ(x) = λnx for any
x ∈ Ln ⊗k R, −2 ≤ n ≤ 2. Assume that a0 ∈ L1. Then, clearly,

φ−1
λ ◦ eσ(a) ◦ φλ = eσ(φ−1

λ (a)) = eσ(a0).

Therefore,

eσ(a)([b, c]) = φλ ◦ eσ(a0) ◦ φ−1
φλ(cid:0)[eσ(a0)(λ−ib), eσ(a0)(λ−j c)](cid:1) = [φλeσ(a0)φ−1

λ ([b, c]) =

λ (b), φλeσ(a0)φ−1

λ (c)] =

[eσ(a)(b), eσ(a)(c)],

which settles the case a0 ∈ L1. If a0 ∈ L−1, one should run the same argument for
λ−1 instead of λ. If a0 ∈ L2σ, then one can run the same argument with the element
√λ of the quadratic ﬁeld extension R√λ of R. Since the map L⊗k R → L⊗k R√λ
is injective, the fact that (3.3) holds in L ⊗k R√λ implies that it holds in L ⊗k R.
Next, assume that R is a domain, and let K be its fraction ﬁeld. By the previous
case the equality (3.3) holds in L ⊗k K. Since the natural map L ⊗k R → L ⊗k K
is injective, we conclude that (3.3) holds in L ⊗k R.

Now let R be arbitrary. Since a, b, c are ﬁnite R-linear combinations of ele-
ments in L, we can assume without loss of generality that R is a ﬁnitely generated
k-algebra. Then R ∼= k[x1, . . . , xn]/I, where k[x1, . . . , xn] is the polynomial ring
in n variables over k. Let ˜a, ˜b and ˜c be any preimages of a, b, c contained in the
corresponding graded summands of L ⊗k k[x1, . . . , xn]. Since k[x1, . . . , xn] is a do-
main, the equality (3.3) holds for ˜a, ˜b, ˜c. Then it holds for a, b, c, since the natural
projection L ⊗k k[x1, . . . , xn] → L ⊗k R preserves the Lie bracket.

Lemma 3.1.7. Let L be a ﬁnite-dimensional 5-graded Lie algebra over a ﬁeld k,

char k 6= 2, 3. If, moreover, char k 6= 5 or L2 ⊕ L−2 = {0}, then L is algebraic.

Proof. Since by Lemma 3.1.3 we have eσ(x)eσ(s) = eσ(x, s), it is enough to
prove the claim for all endomorphisms eσ(a), where a ∈ Li, i 6= 0. If L2⊕L−2 = {0},
we can consider L as a 3-graded Lie algebra. Thus, we are given a (2n + 1)-graded

Lemma 3.1.8. Let L, L′ be two ﬁnite-dimensional 5-graded Lie algebras over a
ﬁeld k, char k 6= 2, 3. Let f : L → L′ be a graded k-homomorphism of Lie algebras,
such that f|Li : Li → L′
i is a bijection for all i ∈ {±1,±2}. If L is algebraic, then
L′ is algebraic.

Proof. We use the same idea as in the proof of Lemma 3.1.7.

In order to

eσ(a)([b, c]) = [eσ(a)(b), eσ(a)(c)]

show that L′ is algebraic, it is enough to show that

8 ≥ m > 4, then the degree m homogeneous component (3.5) of [eσ(a)(b), eσ(a)(c)]

(cid:3)

3.2. One-invertibility in A × S

In [AF99] the notion of n-invertibility for Kantor pairs is introduced. Kantor
pairs are generalizations of Jordan pairs; an example of a Kantor pair is a pair
of structurable algebras, in the same way as every Jordan algebra gives rise to a
Jordan pair.

Since we will only apply the results of [AF99] in the context of a pair of struc-
turable algebras, we only explain the necessary terminology and results of [AF99]
in this context. This makes the exposition less technical, and in Remark 3.2.4 we
explain why our point of view is the same as in [AF99].

Throughout section 3.2, we will assume that k is a ﬁeld of char-
acteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3.

Let A be an arbitrary structurable k-algebra. In section 2.4, we described the
5-graded Lie algebra K(A) constructed from A. In [AF99], a slightly diﬀerent (but
isomorphic) Lie algebra is used. We will adopt this Lie algebra; this will make the
formulas for one-invertibility more elegant.

Definition 3.2.1. Let A be a structurable algebra, and let K(A) be the Lie

algebra as introduced in Deﬁnition 2.4.1 above.

3.2. ONE-INVERTIBILITY IN A × S

35

(i) Consider two copies A+ and A− of A with corresponding isomorphisms A →
A+ : x 7→ x+ and A → A− : x 7→ x−, and let S+ ⊂ A+ and S− ⊂ A− be
the corresponding subspaces of skew elements. We deﬁne a new Lie algebra
K ′(A) with the same underlying vector space and the same grading as K(A),
i.e.

K ′(A) = S− ⊕ A− ⊕ Instrl(A) ⊕ A+ ⊕ S+,

and we keep the Lie bracket of K(A) except that we modify the formulas for
[A±,A±] by a factor −2 as follows:

[x+, y−] := −2Vx,y ∈ Instrl(A),
[x+, x′
+] := −2ψ(x, x′)+ ∈ S+,
[y−, y′
−] := −2ψ(y, y′)− ∈ S−,

for all x, x′, y, y′ ∈ A.
is a Lie algebra isomorphism:

It is straightforward to verify that the following map from K(A) to K ′(A)



Instrl(A) → Instrl(A) : Va,b 7→ Va,b,

S− → S− :

x 7→ x,
y 7→ − 1
2 y,
s 7→ −2s,
t 7→ − 1
2 t.

(ii) Let ζ ∈ Endk(K ′(A)) be the grading derivation of K ′(A). In what follows, it
is convenient to consider ζ as an element of the Lie algebra; we thus deﬁne

(3.7)

g := S− ⊕ A− ⊕ (Instrl(A) + kζ) ⊕ A+ ⊕ S+

with the same Lie bracket as K ′(A) and with [ζ, xi] = ζ(xi) = ixi for all
xi ∈ K ′(A)i with i ∈ [−2, 2]. It follows that also g has a 5-grading with

g0 = K ′(A)0 + kζ = Instrl(A) + kζ,
g±1 = K ′(A)±1 = A±,
g±2 = K ′(A)±2 = S±.

Observe that K ′(A) is an ideal of g and that [g, g] = K ′(A).
The Lie algebra g deﬁned above is the same algebra as in [AF99] in case the
Kantor pair in [AF99] is a pair of structurable algebras, as we now brieﬂy explain.

Definition 3.2.2 ([AF99]). A Kantor pair is a pair of vector spaces (K+, K−)

over k equipped with a trilinear product

{·,·,·} : Kσ × K−σ × Kσ → Kσ,

σ ∈ {−1, 1},

satisfying the following two identities:
(KP1) [Vx,y, Vz,w] = V{x,y,z},w − Vz,{y,x,w};
(KP2) Ka,bVx,y + Vy,xKa,b = KKa,bx,y;
where Vx,yz := {xyz} and Ka,bz := {azb} − {bza}.

36

3. ONE-INVERTIBILITY FOR STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

There is a tight connection between Kantor pairs and Lie triple systems in the

In [AF99], a Z-graded Lie triple system T = Li∈ZTi is called

sense of [Jac68].
sign-graded, if Ti = 0 for all i 6= ±1.

Theorem 3.2.3 ([AF99, Theorem 7]). Let (K+, K−) be a pair of vector spaces

over k equipped with a trilinear product

{·,·,·} : Kσ × K−σ × Kσ → Kσ,

σ ∈ {−1, 1}.

Then (K+, K−) is a Kantor pair if and only if T = K+ ⊕ K− is a sign-graded Lie
triple system with two non-zero graded components T1 = K+ and T−1 = K− and
the triple product [ , , ] : T × T × T → T deﬁned as follows

(3.8)

[xσ, yσ, zσ] = 0;
[xσ, y−σ, zσ] = −{xσ, y−σ, zσ};
[x−σ, yσ, zσ] = {yσ, x−σ, zσ};
[xσ, yσ, z−σ] = {yσ, z−σ, xσ} − {xσ, z−σ, yσ}.

Let T = T1 ⊕ T−1 be a sign-graded Lie triple system over k. In [AF99, p. 532]
g(T )i is deﬁned, which is called the standard
the 5-graded Lie algebra g(T ) =
graded embedding of T . Recall that g(T ) is the Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra

where Der(T ) is the Lie algebra of k-derivations of the Lie triple system T , with
the following graded components:

2Li=−2
Der(T ) ⊕ T ,

g(T )σ = Tσ,

g(T )0 = kδ + [T1,T−1,−] ⊆ Der(T1 ⊕ T−1),

where δ is the grading derivation of g(T ), and

g(T )2σ = [Tσ,Tσ,−] ⊆ Der(T1 ⊕ T−1).

If T = K+ ⊕ K− is the Lie triple system corresponding to a Kantor pair (K+, K−),
the 5-graded Lie algebra g(K+ ⊕ K−) is also called the standard graded embedding
of this Kantor pair.

Remark 3.2.4. Let A be a structurable algebra over k and let A+, A− be two

isomorphic copies of A; then the pair (A+,A−) with the triple product

{x, y, z} := 2Vx,yz = 2{x, y, z}

for x, z ∈ Aσ and y ∈ A−σ is a Kantor pair, and the standard graded embedding
g(A+ ⊕ A−) coincides with the Lie algebra g of (3.7). To see this, we identify
Ls ∈ g(A+ ⊕ A−)±2 with s ∈ g±2 and represent the elements of g(A+ ⊕ A−)0 with
their action on g(A+ ⊕ A−)1. Then the algebras g(A+ ⊕ A−) and g are identical;
this can be veriﬁed using Ka,b = 2Lψ(a,b) and the identity (KP2) of Deﬁnition 3.2.2.
The Lie algebra g(A+ ⊕ A−) is described more explicitly in [AF99, p. 535].

We will now deﬁne some subgroups of Endk(g). In [AF99] the action of Endk(g)
on g is denoted on the left, whereas we need an action on the right in order to be
compatible with the conventions in the theory of Moufang sets. This is why some
formulas diﬀer slightly from [AF99].

3.2. ONE-INVERTIBILITY IN A × S

Definition 3.2.5. Let σ ∈ {−1, +1}, x ∈ gσ, s ∈ g2σ; we deﬁne
(ad(x + s))i ∈ Endk(g).

eσ(x, s) = exp(ad(x + s)) =

4Xi=0

i!

Deﬁne the set

Uσ = {eσ(x, s) | x ∈ gσ, s ∈ g2σ}.

Remark 3.2.6. Throughout [AF99], one uses the fact that the elements eσ(x, s)
are Lie algebra automorphisms of g, i.e. belong to Autk(g). However, the proof of
this statement in [AF99, Theorem 8] requires the (missing) assumption char(k) 6= 5.
We thank Ottmar Loos for bringing this to our attention. In place of the assump-
tion char(k) 6= 5, in what follows we impose the weaker condition that A is algebraic
(see Deﬁnition 3.1.4).

For future reference, we reproduce here the basic properties of eσ(x, s) ∈
Endk(g) claimed in [AF99, Theorem 8] together with a complete proof based on
our results from section 3.1.

Lemma 3.2.7 ([AF99, Theorem 8]). Let A be an algebraic structurable algebra
over k. Let σ ∈ {−1, +1}, then we have the following properties for all x, y ∈ gσ
and s, t ∈ g2σ:
(i) eσ(x, s) is an automorphism of the Lie algebra g,

i.e. [a, b].eσ(x, s) = [a.eσ(x, s), b.eσ(x, s)] for all a, b ∈ g.

(ii) eσ(x, s)eσ(y, t) = eσ(x + y, s + t + ψ(x, y)),
(iii) eσ(x, s)−1 = eσ(−x,−s).
(iv) The map eσ : gσ × g2σ → Uσ : (x, s) 7→ eσ(x, s) is a bijection.

Proof. Since A is algebraic, the 5-graded Lie algebra g is algebraic by Lemma 3.1.8

applied to the natural homomorphism of 5-graded Lie algebras

K(A) ∼= K ′(A) → g.

This implies (i). All other statements follow from Lemma 3.1.3 applied to the
5-graded Lie algebra g; in particular, (iv) follows from Lemma 3.1.3(ii).
(cid:3)

From now on until the end of section 3.2, we will assume that A
is an algebraic structurable algebra over k.

Definition 3.2.8.
gebra A is deﬁned as

(i) The elementary group of the algebraic structurable al-

G := hU+, U−i ≤ Aut(g).

(ii) As in [AF99], we deﬁne H+ as the subgroup of all automorphisms in G that
preserve the gradation of g, and H− as the subset of all automorphisms in G
that reverse the gradation of g, i.e.

H+ := {h ∈ G | ζ.h = ζ}

H− := {h ∈ G | ζ.h = −ζ}

= {h ∈ G | gi.h = gi for all i ∈ {−2,−1, 0, 1, 2}},

= {h ∈ G | gi.h = g−i for all i ∈ {−2,−1, 0, 1, 2}}.

38

3. ONE-INVERTIBILITY FOR STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

(iii) Deﬁne ϕ ∈ Endk(g), which reverses the gradation of g, as follows:

g0 → g0 :

A1 → A−1 :
A−1 → A1 :
A2 → A−2 :
A−2 → A2 :

Va,b 7→ −Vb,a,

ζ 7→ −ζ,
x 7→ x,
x 7→ x,
s 7→ s,
s 7→ s.

We will observe in Lemma 3.2.9(ii) that ϕ is an automorphism of g, and in
Lemma 5.1.4 below, we will show that it is, in fact, an element of H−.

In Theorem 5.1.1 we will show that if all elements in A × S are one-invertible,

then the group G = hU+, U−i is an abstract rank one group.
Lemma 3.2.9. Let σ ∈ {−1, +1} and (x, s) ∈ gσ × g2σ.

(i) For all h ∈ H−, we have eσ(x, s)h = e−σ(x.h, s.h) and Uσ
(ii) We have ϕ ∈ Aut(g), eσ(x, s)ϕ = e−σ(x, s) and H−

ϕ = H−.

h = U−σ.

Proof.

(3.9)

(i) Let h ∈ H−. Then
a. ad(x + s)h = a.(h−1 ad(x + s)h) = a. ad(x.h + s.h)

for all a ∈ g, since h is an automorphism of g. Since h reverses the grading, we
have (x.h, s.h) ∈ g−σ × g−2σ, and hence it follows from (3.9) that eσ(x, s)h =
e−σ(x.h, s.h). Since h is an isomorphism, we conclude that Uσ
(ii) It follows from the deﬁnition of the Lie bracket of g that ϕ ∈ Autk(g), using
(2.23) to show that [s, t].ϕ = [s.ϕ, t.ϕ] for s ∈ g2 and t ∈ g−2. Next, since
ad(x + s)ϕ = ad(x.ϕ + s.ϕ), we have eσ(x, s)ϕ = e−σ(x, s). To show the ﬁnal
statement, notice that gi.ϕ−1hϕ = g−i.hϕ = gi.ϕ = g−i. Since Gϕ = G, we
conclude that H ϕ

h = U−σ.

− = H−.

It is not clear a priori that ϕ is actually contained in H−.

In Lemma 5.1.4

below, however, we will show that this is indeed the case.

Notation 3.2.10. Let (x, s) ∈ A × S. As A+ and A− are copies of A and
S− and S+ copies of S, we can write eσ(x, s) without causing any confusion: If
we write e+(x, s) we consider (x, s) as an element of A+ × S+, whereas if we write
e−(x, s) we consider (x, s) as an element of A− × S−.

We have now collected enough background information to deﬁne the notion of

one-invertibility.

Definition 3.2.11.
if there exist (y, t), (z, r) ∈ A × S such that

(i) Let (x, s) ∈ A×S. We say that (x, s) is one-invertible

e−(z, r)e+(x, s)e−(y, t) ∈ H−.

Using Lemma 3.2.9(ii), we see that this condition is equivalent with

e+(z, r)e−(x, s)e+(y, t) ∈ H−.

3.2. ONE-INVERTIBILITY IN A × S

39

(ii) If (x, s) is one-invertible, we say that (x, s) has left 1 inverse (y, t) and right
inverse (z, r). By [AF99, Lemma 11], the left and right inverses are unique.
(iii) Let (x, s) ∈ A×S be one-invertible with right inverse (z, r). Deﬁne the linear

map P(x,s) : A → A given by

P(x,s)a := Ux(cid:16)a +

for all a ∈ A.
Remark 3.2.12. In [AF99, Section 5], n-invertibility for an n-tuple in

ψ(z, a)x(cid:17) + s(cid:0)a + 2ψ(z, a)x(cid:1)

(gσ × g2σ) × (g−σ × g−2σ) × ··· × (g(−1)n−1σ × g(−1)n−12σ)

is deﬁned in a similar way, but we will not need this more general notion.

The following theorem gives us a very useful characterization of one-invertibility.
(i) An element (x, s) ∈ A × S is

Theorem 3.2.13 ([AF99, Theorem 13]).
one-invertible if and only if there exists (u, t) ∈ A × S such that

Vx,u = id + LsLt,

(3.10)

su = −
ψ(x, s(tx)) = 0.

Ux(tx),

This system of equations has either no solutions or exactly one solution.

(ii) Let (x, s) ∈ A × S be one-invertible with (u, t) the solution of the system of
equations (3.10). Then the left inverse of (x, s) is (u − tx, t) and its right
inverse is (u + tx, t).
(iii) Let (x, s) ∈ A × S be one-invertible with (u, t) the solution of the system of

equations (3.10). For each σ ∈ {−1, 1}, let

hσ := e−σ(u + tx, t) eσ(x, s) e−σ(u − tx, t) ∈ H−.

Then hσ|gσ = P(u−tx,t) = P(u+tx,t) and hσ|g−σ = P(x,s).
Proof. We transfer [AF99, Theorem 13] to our setup using Remark 3.2.4.
It is shown in the proof in [AF99] that (x, s) ∈ gσ × g2σ is one-invertible if and

only if there exist (u, t) ∈ g−σ × g−2σ such that

2[s, t] + [x, u] + 2σζ = 0,

(3.11)

[s, u] −
−

[x, [x, [x, t]]] = 0,

[x, [x, [s, t]]] = 0,

and that in this case the left inverse of (x, s) is (u − tx, t) and the right inverse is
(u + tx, t).

The last two equations of (3.11) immediately give the last two equations of
(3.10), but the ﬁrst equation needs some more explanation. Recall that the iden-
tiﬁcation between g(L(A)) and g in Remark 3.2.4 was made in such a way that
the elements of g(L(A))0 are identiﬁed with their action on A+. So let w ∈ A+; if
σ = +1, we get

(3.12)

ad(2[s, t] + [x, u] + 2σζ)(w) = 2LsLtw − 2Vx,uw + 2w = 0,

1Recall that the action of G is on the right.

40

3. ONE-INVERTIBILITY FOR STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

and if σ = −1, we get
(3.13)

ad(2[s, t] + [x, u] + 2σζ)(w) = −2LtLsw + 2Vu,xw − 2w = 0.

Thus we have two conditions Vx,u = id + LsLt and Vu,x = id + LtLs. These two
identities are equivalent when we consider x, u ∈ A and s, t ∈ S, since V ǫ
u,x =
idǫ + (LtLs)ǫ gives −Vx,u = −id − LsLt with ǫ as deﬁned on page 25.

Since the left and right inverses of an one-invertible element are uniquely de-
termined, the system of equations (3.10) has either no solutions or it has a unique
solution.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.2.14.

(i) In the setup of [AF99], the equations (3.12) and (3.13)
are not necessarily equivalent, since they deal with the more general situation
of Kantor pairs.

(ii) In [AF99], the identity that should be satisﬁed is given by Vx,u = 2(id+LsLt);
notice that the diﬀerence with the ﬁrst equation of (3.10) is caused by the
fact that the V -operator in [AF99] is the double of the V -operator of the
structurable algebra.

The following lemma shows that one-invertibility in A × S is a generalization

of conjugate invertibility in A.

Lemma 3.2.15.
(i) Let x ∈ A. Then (x, 0) ∈ A × S is one-invertible if and
only if x is conjugate invertible in A. The left and right inverse of (x, 0) are
both equal to (ˆx, 0).
(ii) Let s ∈ S. Then (0, s) ∈ A × S is one-invertible if and only if s is conjugate

invertible in A. The left and right inverse of (0, s) are both equal to (0, ˆs).
Proof.

(i) If we want to determine the one-invertibility of (x, 0), the system

of equations (3.10) reduces to

Vx,u = id,
1

0 = −
0 = 0.

Uxtx,

From the ﬁrst equation it follows that this system of equations can only have
a solution if x is conjugate invertible. In this case, by (2.10), u = ˆx and t = 0
is the solution.

(ii) If we want to determine the one-invertibility of (0, s), the system of equations

(3.10) reduces to

0 = id + LsLt,

su = 0,

0 = 0.

From the ﬁrst equation it follows that this system of equations can only have
a solution if s is conjugate invertible. In this case, by (2.13), u = 0 and t = ˆs
is the solution.
(cid:3)

The map P(x,s) deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.2.11 is a generalization of the map Px

on the structurable algebra A deﬁned in (2.32). Indeed, using (2.6), we obtain

3.3. One-invertibility for structurable division algebras

Throughout section 3.3, we will continue to assume that k is a
ﬁeld of characteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3 and that A is an
algebraic structurable algebra over k.

It follows from Lemma 3.2.15 that if A is a structurable algebra such that
each element in A × S \ (0, 0) is one-invertible, then A is a structurable division
algebra. In Theorem 3.3.7, we will show that also the converse is true:
if A is a
structurable division algebra, then each element of A × S \ (0, 0) is one-invertible,
and we determine the left and right inverse.

We start by showing that (1, s) ∈ A × S is always one-invertible if A is a

structurable division algebra.

Lemma 3.3.1 (J. Faulkner). Let A be a structurable division algebra, let s 6=

0 ∈ S. Then s + ˆs 6= 0, and

is the solution of

(3.14)

u := −ˆs([s + ˆs) = \1 − s2,

t := [s + ˆs

V1,u = id + LsLt,

U1t,

su = −
ψ(1, st) = 0.

In particular, (1, s) is one-invertible.

from (2.13) that s + ˆs = 0 if and only if s2 = 1.

Proof. It follows from (2.30) and (2.13) that −ˆs([s + ˆs) = \1 − s2. It follows
We suppose that s2 = 1 and deduce a contradiction. Deﬁne a := 1 + s. It
follows from (2.3) that LsLs = Ls2 = id; therefore (xa)a = (xa)a = 0 for all x ∈ A.
Since a 6= 0, it is conjugate invertible, we ﬁnd that

a = Va,ˆaa = 2(aˆa)a − (aa)ˆa = 2(aˆa)a

and

a contradiction. It follows that s +bs 6= 0.

Next, we claim that, for t := [s + ˆs,

(3.15)

Lst = LsLt = LtLs.

By (2.13) and the fact that L2

[Ls, Lt] = 0. Hence [s, t] = [Ls, Lt](1) = 0 and from (2.3) it follows that for all y ∈ A

s = Ls2 we have [Ls, Ls+ˆs] = 0, therefore [Ls,−L−1

2(Lst − LsLt)y = 2[s, t, y] = [s, t, y] − [t, s, y]

= (L[s,t] − [Ls, Lt])y = 0,

and (3.15) follows.

We now verify that u = −ˆs([s + ˆs) and t = [s + ˆs are solutions of (3.14).

(1) Since the conjugate inverse of a skew element is again a skew element and ˆs
and t commute, we have u = u; hence V1,u = Lu. From (3.15) it follows that
id + LsLt = id + LtLs = L1+st, the ﬁrst equation of (3.14) is satisﬁed since

1 + st = −(s + ˆs)t + st = −ˆst = u.

3 U1t = −t = LsLˆst = −su.

(2) We have 1
(3) We have ψ(1, st) = st − st = ts − st = 0 by (3.15).
This shows that (u, t) is indeed a solution of (3.14). By Theorem 3.2.13, we conclude
that (1, s) is one-invertible.
(cid:3)

From now on let A be a structurable division algebra and let (x, s) ∈ A × S
with x 6= 0 and s 6= 0. Our aim is to determine the solution of (3.10). It follows
from (2.38) that x = ˆˆx is the unity in the structurable algebra Ahˆxi, an isotope
of A as described in Construction 2.5.3. From the previous lemma we know that
(x, s) is one-invertible in the algebra Ahˆxi. We will show that this implies that
(x, s) is one-invertible also in A. We are indebted to John Faulkner for bringing
this method to our attention.

Definition 3.3.2. Let x ∈ A \ {0}, and deﬁne
αx : A → Ahˆxi : y 7→ y.

Note that αx(1) is not the unit in Ahˆxi, but that x is the unit. The map αx is an
isotopy (see Deﬁnition 2.5.1) with ˆαx = Px. Indeed, using (2.39) we get
αx{x, y, z} = {αxx, ˆαxy, αxz}hˆxi ⇐⇒ {x, y, z} = {x, PˆxPxy, z},

which holds by (2.33).

We need to determine a map from S onto Shˆxi = S ˆx that is compatible with

αx and ˆαx.

Then
(i) qx(s)ˆx = Px(sx) = − 1

(ii) Using (i) we ﬁnd

qˆx(qx(s))x = Pˆx(qx(s)ˆx) = Pˆx(Px(sx)) = sx,

which shows that qˆx(qx(s))x = sx; this implies that qˆx ◦ qx = id. Similarly,
qx ◦ qˆx = id.

(iii) By (2.30) and (2.29) ,

\(qx(s))x = \(qx(s)ˆx) = \Px(sx) = Pˆx(ˆsˆx) = qˆx(ˆs)x;

it follows that [qx(s) = qˆx(ˆs).

Lemma 3.3.5. Let (x, s) ∈ A×S \{0, 0} and (u, t) ∈ A×S \{0, 0}. Then (u, t)
is the solution of the equations (3.10) w.r.t. (x, s) in A if and only if (ˆαxu, ˆβxt) ∈
Ahˆxi × Shˆxi is the solution of the equations (3.10) w.r.t. (αxx, βxs) in Ahˆxi.

Proof. Let (x, s) ∈ A × S \ {0, 0} and let α := αx, ˆα := ˆαx, β := βx, ˆβ := ˆβx.

Suppose that the following equations hold in A:

Vx,u = id + LsLt,

Since α, ˆα, β, ˆβ are bijections we conclude that (u, t) is the solution of the equations

γx|g−1 = bαx,
γx|g−2 = bβx,

γx(ζ) = ζ.

Using (2.40), (2.41), (3.16) and Lemma 3.3.4(iii), it can be veriﬁed that γx is a Lie
algebra isomorphism. This can be used to give a diﬀerent proof of Lemma 3.3.5,
but the veriﬁcation of the fact that γx is a Lie algebra isomorphism requires more
eﬀort than we needed in our proof of Lemma 3.3.5.

In [AH81, Section 12] it is shown that each isomorphism from K(A) to K(A′)

can be obtained in a similar way from an isotopy between A and A′.

We are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 3.3.7. Let A be a structurable division algebra, and let 0 6= x ∈ A
and 0 6= s ∈ S. Then (x, s) is one-invertible. Moreover, the solution of the system
of equations (3.10) is

u =(cid:0)x − s(qˆx(s)x)(cid:1)∧

= −ˆs(cid:0)(qˆx(s) + ˆs)∧ ˆx(cid:1)

and

t =(cid:0)s + qx(ˆs)(cid:1)∧

,

where the expressions of which the conjugate inverse is taken are diﬀerent from
zero.

Proof. Let 0 6= x ∈ A and 0 6= s ∈ S, and let α := αx, ˆα := ˆαx, β := βx, ˆβ :=
ˆβx. We have (αx, βs) = (x, sˆx). Now x = bˆx = 1hˆxi, by (2.38). We can apply
Lemma 3.3.1 to ﬁnd the solution of the equations (3.10) for (x, sˆx) in Ahˆxi; we then
use Lemma 3.3.5 to translate this solution back to A.
In Lemma 3.3.1, we found that for (1, s) we have u = −Lˆst = \1 − s2 and t =
[s + ˆs. It also follows from this lemma that the expressions of which the conjugate
inverses are considered, are never zero.

By (2.42), Lemma 3.3.4(i) and (2.30), ˆβ(t) ∈ Ahˆxi is equal to
= Px((cid:0)sˆx + Px(csˆx)(cid:1)∧
ˆβ(t) =(cid:0)β(s) + (β(s))∧hˆxi(cid:1)∧hˆxi

In order to determine ˆαx(u) in Ahˆxi, we ﬁrst

CHAPTER 4

Simple structurable algebras and simple algebraic

groups

In this chapter, we will study the connection between simple structurable al-
gebras and simple algebraic groups. In one direction, we will show in section 4.1,
in full generality, that every algebraic central simple structurable algebra A over a
ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, 3 gives rise to an adjoint simple algebraic k-group. For the
converse, we restrict to the rank one case; in section 4.3, we will show that, for any
adjoint simple algebraic group G of k-rank 1 over a ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, 3, there
is a structurable division algebra A over k such that G is precisely the algebraic
group arising from A.

Again, we will pay special attention to the case char(k) = 5 and the related
notion of algebraicity. More precisely, we will show in section 4.2 that every Lie
algebra of an adjoint simple algebraic k-group is indeed algebraic, and we will
deduce from this that any structurable division algebra is algebraic. This will allow
us, from section 4.3 on, to part with the algebraicity condition when we deal with
structurable division algebras.

4.1. Simple algebraic groups from simple structurable algebras

In this section, we show how to associate in a natural way to an algebraic simple
structurable algebra A over a ﬁeld k of characteristic 6= 2, 3 a simple algebraic
k-group G. Eventually, this will serve to prove that the Moufang sets we will
construct in Theorem 5.1.6 are, in fact, Moufang sets arising from linear algebraic
groups of k-rank one (as described in Theorem 1.2.1), but our results in section 4.1
are more general.

All commutative rings and algebras mentioned in this section are assumed to

be unital.

The main result of the present section is the following theorem.

Theorem 4.1.1. Let A be an algebraic central simple structurable algebra over
a ﬁeld k of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, 3. Then the algebraic k-group G =
Aut(K(A))◦ is an adjoint absolutely simple group of k-rank ≥ 1, and K(A) =
[Lie(G), Lie(G)].

In the proof of Theorem 4.1.1 we will employ the following Lie-theoretic gadget.

Assume that R be a commutative ring, and let L = Li∈Z Li be a Z-graded Lie
algebra over R. Recall that L is called (2n + 1)-graded, if Li = 0 for all i ∈ Z such
that |i| > n.

Construction 4.1.2. For any (2n + 1)-graded Lie algebra L over R we deﬁne

the (2n + 1)-graded Lie algebra

eL =Mi∈Z eLi

over R as follows. For any i 6= 0, eLi = Li. For i = 0, we deﬁne eL0 to be the set of
all φ = (φi) ∈ Qi∈Z\{0}

EndR(Li) satisfying the following conditions:

φi+j([a, b]) = [φi(a), b] + [a, φj(b)]

for all − n ≤ i, j ≤ n, i, j 6= 0, i 6= −j; a ∈ Li, b ∈ Lj ;

φj ([[a, b], c]) = [[φi(a), b], c] + [[a, φ−i(b)], c] + [[a, b], φj(c)]

(4.1)

for all − n ≤ i, j ≤ n, i, j 6= 0, a ∈ Li, b ∈ L−i, c ∈ Lj.

In other words, φ ∈ eL0 behaves as a derivation of L that preserves grading, except
that φ is not deﬁned on L0. Clearly, eL0 is an R-module.
We deﬁne the Lie bracket [−,−] eL on eL in terms of the Lie bracket [−,−] on L
as follows. For any u ∈ eLi, v ∈ eLj, i, j ∈ Z, we let
(cid:0)ad([u, v])|Li(cid:1)i∈Z\{0}

if i = −j, i 6= 0;
if i = 0, j 6= 0;
if i 6= 0, j = 0;
if i = j = 0.

Note that the Lie algebra eL by construction contains an element ζ ∈ eL0 which

acts as a grading derivation:

It is also easy to see that there is a natural graded Lie algebra homomorphism

[ζ, x] = ix for any i ∈ Z and x ∈ eLi.
L → eL that sends any element x ∈ L0 to (cid:0)ad(x)|Li(cid:1)i∈Z\{0}.
Lemma 4.1.3. Let L be a (2n + 1)-graded Lie algebra over a commutative ring
R such that (2n)! ∈ R×, and let eL = eL0 ⊕ Li6=0Li be the Lie algebra of Construc-
tion 4.1.2. Then the natural homomorphism ad : eL → DerR(eL), x 7→ ad(x), is an
Proof. We ﬁrst show that ad is injective. Let a ∈ ker(ad), and write a =
Pi∈Z ai with ai ∈ eLi for all i. Since eL contains the grading derivation ζ, this
already implies ai = 0 for all i 6= 0, so that a ∈ eL0, and now ad a coincides with a

Note that [ai, b] = 0 as soon as |i| > n, since ai = 0. Thus we have

Hence D′ preserves eLi, i ∈ Z. Then, since D′ is a derivation, by the very deﬁnition
of eL there is an element x ∈ eL0 such that for any u ∈ eLi, i 6= 0, we have D′(u) =
ad(x)(u). Then for any y ∈ eL0 and u ∈ eLi, i 6= 0, we have
ad([x, y])(u) = ad(x)(cid:0)ad(y)(u)(cid:1) − ad(y)(cid:0)ad(x)(u)(cid:1)
= D′(cid:0)ad(y)(u)(cid:1) − ad(y)(cid:0)D′(u)(cid:1)
= D′([y, u]) − [y, D′(u)] = [D′(y), u] = D′(y)(u),
which implies that [x, y] = D′(y) as elements of eL0. Consequently, D′ acts on the
whole of eL as ad(x), that is, D′ ∈ ad(eL), and therefore D ∈ ad(eL) as well.
Lemma 4.1.4. Let L be a (2n + 1)-graded ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra over a
ﬁeld k. Then for any commutative k-algebra R, there is a natural isomorphism of
(2n + 1)-graded R-Lie algebras

given by a ﬁnite set of linear equations with coeﬃcients in k, obtained by substitut-

4. SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS AND SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

Note that Aut(L) and Der(L) are naturally represented by closed k-subschemes
of the aﬃne k-scheme of linear endomorphisms of L. In particular, Lemmas 4.1.3
and 4.1.4 imply that there is an isomorphism of functors

eL ∼= Der(eL).

Lemma 4.1.5. Let L be a central simple ﬁnite-dimensional (2n + 1)-graded Lie

algebra over a ﬁeld k, and let K be a ﬁeld extension of k.
(i) Let Ii ⊆ L(K)i, i ∈ Z \ {0}, be K-subspaces that satisfy the following condi-

tions: for all i, j ∈ Z \ {0} such that i 6= −j we have

[L(K)i, Ij] ⊆ Ii+j ;

[[L(K)i, I−i],L(K)i] ⊆ Ii;

(ii) If f ∈ Aut(eL)(K) satisﬁes f|L(K)i = idL(K)i for all i ∈ Z \ {0}, then f =
Proof. Since L is central simple over k, the K-Lie algebra L(K) = L ⊗k K is

also central simple. In particular, we have

L(K)0 = Xi∈Z\{0}

[L(K)i,L(K)−i].

(Indeed, the sum of the right hand side of (4.7) and Li∈Z\{0}L(K)i is an ideal of
L(K).) We claim that

J = Mi∈Z\{0}

Ii ⊕ Xi∈Z\{0}

[L(K)i, I−i]

is a Lie ideal in L(K). By (4.7), it is enough to check that for any i, j ∈ Z \ {0} we
have

(4.8)

and

[Ii,L(K)j] ⊆ J,

(4.9)
The inclusion (4.8) holds by the deﬁnition of J if j = −i, and by (4.4) if j 6= −i.
The inclusion (4.9) holds by (4.5) and (4.6) if j = ±i. If j 6= ±i, then (4.9) follows
from Jacobi identity and (4.4):

[[L(K)i, I−i],L(K)j] ⊆ J.

[[L(K)i, I−i],L(K)j]

⊆ [L(K)i, [I−i,L(K)j]] + [I−i, [L(K)i,L(K)j]]

⊆ [L(K)i, Ij−i] + [I−i,L(K)i+j ] ⊆ Ij.

Thus, J is an ideal. Then J = 0 or J = L(K), which implies the claim (i).

Now we prove (ii). Take any d ∈ eL(K)0 and write

f (d) =Xi∈Z

vi,

vi ∈ eL(K)i, i ∈ Z.

4.1. SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS FROM SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

51

For any j ∈ Z \ {0} and any u ∈ eL(K)j = L(K)j we have

[f (d), u] = [f (d), f (u)] = f ([d, u]) = [d, u] ∈ L(K)j .

Therefore,

[f (d), u] = [d, u] = [v0, u],

and for any i ∈ Z \ {0} we have [vi, u] = 0. By the very deﬁnition of eL(K)0, the

equality [d, u] = [v0, u] for all u as above implies that d = v0.

It remains to show that vi = 0 for all i ∈ Z \ {0}. For any i ∈ Z \ {0} set

Ii = {v ∈ L(K)i | [v,L(K)j] = 0 for any j ∈ Z \ {0}}.

Clearly, vi ∈ Ii for all i ∈ Z\ {0}. Moreover, [Ii,L(K)j] = 0 for all j ∈ Z\ {0}, and
hence the Ii trivially satisfy the assumptions of (i). Therefore, either Ii = 0 for all
i ∈ Z \ {0}, or Ii = L(K)i for all i ∈ Z \ {0}. The latter is not possible since L(K)
is a simple Lie algebra. We conclude that vi = 0 for all i ∈ Z \ {0}.

between adjoint simple algebraic groups and their Lie algebras.

G over k. Denote Lie(Gsc) by Lsc. One has ker(π) = Cent(Gsc). Note that, since
G and Gsc are smooth and ker(π) is ﬁnite, we have

(4.10)

Set

dim L = dim G = dim Gsc = dimLsc.

L′ = π(Lsc) = Lsc/ Lie(Cent(Gsc)) ⊆ L.

Let ¯k be the algebraic closure of k. It is well-known that Lie(Gsc ×k ¯k) = Lsc ⊗k ¯k
is a split Chevalley Lie algebra over ¯k.
Assume that char k = 0. Then Lie(Cent(Gsc)) = 0, and the Lie algebra Lsc = L

is simple, since Lsc ⊗k ¯k is simple. Hence

L = [L,L] = Der(L).

Assume that char k > 3. If G is not of type An or char k does not divide n + 1,
then the k-group Cent(Gsc) is smooth, and hence satisﬁes Lie(Cent(Gsc)) = 0.
It is also known that in this case the Chevalley Lie algebra Lsc ⊗k ¯k is simple
(see e.g. [Sel67, p. 29]). Hence Lsc ∼= L′ is simple. By (4.10) we have L′ = L.
Therefore, L is simple and [L,L] = L. It is also known that we have L′ ⊗k ¯k =
Der(L′ ⊗k ¯k) [Blo62], [Win84, Theorem 3.6], and hence

L = Der(L).

Assume that G is of type An and char k divides n + 1. In this case Lsc ⊗k ¯k =
n+1,¯k) is the Lie algebra of (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrices of trace 0 over ¯k.
Lie(SL
The Lie algebra L′ ⊗k ¯k is the quotient of Lsc ⊗k ¯k by its 1-dimensional center Z
consisting of diagonal matrices of trace 0. It is known that L′ ⊗k ¯k is simple and of
codimension 1 in its Lie algebra of derivations that coincides with the Lie algebra of
all (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrices over ¯k modulo diagonal matrices [Zas39, pp. 59–60].
Consequently,

Clearly, we also have

Der(L′ ⊗k ¯k) = Lie(PGL

n+1,¯k) = L ⊗k ¯k.

We claim that these two facts imply

[L ⊗k ¯k,L ⊗k ¯k] = L′ ⊗k ¯k.

Der(L ⊗k ¯k) = L ⊗k ¯k.

(4.11)
Indeed, let D be a ¯k-derivation of L ⊗k ¯k. Then D induces a derivation on [L ⊗k
¯k,L ⊗k ¯k]. Hence there is x ∈ L ⊗k ¯k such that D|L′⊗k ¯k = ad x|L′⊗k ¯k. Then for
any y ∈ L ⊗k ¯k and any u ∈ L′ ⊗k ¯k we have

[D(y), u] = D([y, u]) − [y, D(u)] = [x, [y, u]] − [y, [x, u]] = [[x, y], u].

Since L′ ⊗k ¯k has trivial center, we deduce that D(y) = [x, y] for any y ∈ L ⊗k ¯k,
which means that D = ad x. This proves (4.11). Therefore, over k we conclude
that L′ = [L,L] is simple, of codimension 1 in L, and
L = Der([L,L]) = Der(L).

It remains to show that in all these cases, L′ = [L,L] is, moreover, central
simple. Let l be any ﬁeld extension of k. Then L′ ⊗k l = [L ⊗k l,L ⊗k l]. Since
L ⊗k l = Lie(G ×k l), and G ×k l is an adjoint simple l-group, the above argument
implies that L′ ⊗k l is simple. Hence L′ is central simple.

Now we ﬁnish the proof of (ii). Let M denote any of the Lie algebras L, L′. Let
Ad : G → Aut(M) be the natural homomorphism of k-groups. By [DG70b, Ch. II,
§4, 2.3] we have Lie(Aut(M)) ∼= Der(M), and by [DG70b, Ch. II, §4, 4.2] we know
that Lie(Ad) = ad : L → Der(M) is the natural map. We have seen above that
the map ad is bijective. Then by [DG70b, Ch. II, §5, Corollaire 5.5(a)] ker(Ad) is
étale. Since G is adjoint, this implies that ker(Ad) = 1. Then by [DG70b, Ch. II,
§5, Proposition 5.1 and Corollaire 5.6] Ad is an open and closed immersion. Since
G is connected, this implies that G ∼= Aut(M)◦.
(cid:3)

Definition 4.1.7. Let L = Li∈Z Li be a Z-graded Lie algebra over a ﬁeld k.
Consider the 1-dimensional split k-subtorus S ∼= Gm of Aut(L) deﬁned as follows:
for any k-algebra R, any t ∈ Gm(R), and any i ∈ Z, v ∈ Li ⊗k R, we set t · v = tiv.
We call S the grading torus of L.

We deduce Theorem 4.1.1 from the following more general result.

Theorem 4.1.8. Let L be an algebraic central simple 5-graded Lie algebra over
a ﬁeld k of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, 3, such that L 6= L0. Then the algebraic
k-group G = Aut(L)◦ is an adjoint absolutely simple group of k-rank ≥ 1, satisfying
L = [Lie(G), Lie(G)] and Lie(G) ∼= eL.

4.1. SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS FROM SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS

53

Proof. Instead of proving the claim of the theorem directly, we prove that

G = Aut(cid:0)eL(cid:1)◦

is an adjoint simple algebraic k-group of k-rank ≥ 1, where eL is
the Lie algebra associated to the 5-graded algebra L in Construction 4.1.2. We
ﬁrst explain how this result implies the theorem. By [DG70b, II, §4, 2.3] for any
ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra L over k there is a natural isomorphism of functors
(4.12)

Der(L) ∼= Lie(Aut(L)).

Therefore,

Lie(G) = Lie(cid:0)Aut(cid:0)eL(cid:1)(cid:1) ∼= Der(cid:0)eL(cid:1).

Combining this fact with (4.3), we conclude that Lie(G) ∼= eL. Since L is simple,
the natural homomorphism of Lie algebras L → eL is injective, and L is a simple
ideal of eL. By Lemma 4.1.6, also [Lie(G), Lie(G)] is a simple ideal of Lie(G) ∼= eL.
Since [L,L] 6= 0, we thus have

L ∩ [eL, eL] = L = [eL, eL].
Applying Lemma 4.1.6 again, we deduce that G ∼= Aut(L)◦.
Now we proceed to establish that G = Aut(cid:0)eL(cid:1)◦
k-group of k-rank ≥ 1. Let S ⊆ Aut(cid:0)eL(cid:1) be the grading torus of eL. Since S is
connected, we have S ⊆ G. By Lemma 4.1.3 we have Der(cid:0)eL(cid:1) = eL, and (4.12) then
implies Lie(G) = eL; moreover, the adjoint action of S on Lie(G) is precisely the

one described in Deﬁnition 4.1.7.

is an adjoint simple algebraic

It remains to show that G is an adjoint simple algebraic k-group. In order to

do that, it is enough to establish the same for

where ¯k is an algebraic closure of k. Note that by Lemma 4.1.4 we have

,

G ×k ¯k = Aut(cid:0)eL ⊗k ¯k(cid:1)◦
eL ⊗k ¯k =(cid:0)L ⊗k ¯k(cid:1)e.

Since L is algebraic, the 5-graded Lie algebra L⊗k¯k is also algebraic by Lemma 3.1.6.
Since L is central simple, the Lie algebra L ⊗k ¯k is also central simple. Summing
up, we can assume that k = ¯k from now on.
Note that by Lemma 3.1.8 the 5-graded Lie algebra eL is algebraic. By Lemma 3.1.3

applied to eL, there are homomorphic closed embeddings
where Uσ is the aﬃne k-variety eLσ ⊕ eL2σ = Lσ ⊕L2σ considered as a k-group with

(x, s) 7→ eσ(x, s),

respect to the operation

eσ : Uσ → GL(cid:0)eL(cid:1),
(x, s) + (y, t) =(cid:0)x + y, s + t +

[x, y](cid:1).

We identify Uσ with its image under eσ. Since eL is algebraic, we have Uσ ⊆ Aut(eL).

Note that since Uσ as a variety is isomorphic to an aﬃne k-space, it is connected
and smooth. By the very deﬁnition of a Lie algebra of an algebraic group we have

as k-Lie algebras.

Lie(Uσ) ∼= eLσ ⊕ eL2σ

54

4. SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS AND SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

Let Z be the closed k-subgroup of Aut(cid:0)eL(cid:1) generated by U+ and U− in the
sense of [DG70a, Exp. VIB Prop. 7.1]. Since L 6= L0, the group Z is non-trivial.
By loc. cit. Z is smooth. Since U+ and U− are connected, Z is also connected,
and hence Z ⊆ G. Since S normalizes Uσ, it normalizes Z. Therefore, Lie(Z) is a
Z-graded Lie subalgebra of eL. Moreover, (4.13) implies that
for all i ∈ Z \ {0},
and L ⊆ Lie(Z).

Lie(Z)i = eLi = Li

We show that Z is an adjoint simple k-group. Let U be the last non-trivial
member of the algebraic lower central series of the unipotent radical Ru(Z). Then
U is a commutative algebraic k-group which is a characteristic closed k-subgroup
of Z. Since S acts on Z, we conclude that Lie(U) is a commutative Z-graded Lie

(4.14)

ideal in Lie(Z). Note that the k-subspaces Lie(U)i ⊆ eLi = Li, i ∈ Z \ {0}, satisfy
the assumptions of Lemma 4.1.5(i), and recall that L is central simple. Hence
Lie(U)i = 0 or Lie(U)i = eLi for all i ∈ Z \ {0}. The latter is not possible, since
Lie(U) is a commutative Lie algebra. Hence Lie(U)i = 0 for all i ∈ Z \ {0}. Then
also Lie(U)0 = 0, since

[Lie(U)0, eLi] = [Lie(U)0, Lie(Z)i] ⊆ Lie(U)i = 0

for any i ∈ Z \ {0}, and on the other hand the adjoint action of Lie(U)0 ⊆ eL0 on
Li∈Z\{0} eLi is faithful by the deﬁnition of eL. Thus, Lie(U) = 0, and hence U is trivial.
This proves that Z is reductive. Moreover, Z acts faithfully on Lie(Z), since Z ⊆ G
and G = Aut(cid:0)eL(cid:1)◦
acts faithfully on Li∈Z\{0} eLi by Lemma 4.1.5(ii). Hence Z is
semisimple and adjoint. Assume Z is not simple. Then Z ∼= Z1 × Z2 is a product of
two non-trivial semisimple adjoint k-groups, and Lie(Z) = Lie(Z1)⊕Lie(Z2), where
Lie(Z1) and Lie(Z2) are non-trivial Lie ideals of Lie(Z). However, this contradicts
Lemma 4.1.5(i). Therefore, Z is a simple adjoint k-group.

Now we apply Lemma 4.1.6 to Z. Since L ⊆ Lie(Z), and because both L
and [Lie(Z), Lie(Z)] are simple Lie algebras, we see that L = [Lie(Z), Lie(Z)] and
Lie(Z) = Der(L). Since Lie(Z) ⊆ eL, and the natural Lie homomorphism
is injective, we have Lie(Z) = eL. Then, again by Lemma 4.1.6, we have Z =
Aut(cid:0)eL(cid:1)◦
Proof of Theorem 4.1.1. Since A is central simple, the Lie algebra K(A)
is also central simple by [All79, §5]. Since A is algebraic, K(A) is also algebraic.
Thus the claim follows from Theorem 4.1.8.

eL → Der(L)

. This ﬁnishes the proof.

The following statement readily follows from the proof of Theorem 4.1.8.

Corollary 4.1.9. Let A be an algebraic central simple structurable algebra
over a ﬁeld k of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, 3, and let G = Aut(K(A))◦. Then
Lie(G) ∼= Der(K(A)) ∼=

^K(A).

4.2. Deducing algebraicity

In this section we show that if a 5-graded Lie algebra over a ﬁeld k of character-
istic 6= 2, 3 is the tangent Lie algebra of an adjoint simple algebraic k-group, then
it is algebraic. Of course, this is automatically true if char k 6= 2, 3, 5, thanks to
Lemma 3.1.7. However, since our proof is independent of characteristic and involves
a general technical lemma that is potentially useful in other contexts, we do not
restrict ourselves to the characteristic 5 case. As a consequence, we also show that
any structurable division algebra over a ﬁeld of characteristic 5 is automatically
algebraic.

Definition 4.2.1. Let G be an algebraic group over a ﬁeld k and T ⊆ G be
a split n-dimensional k-subtorus of G. Let X ∗(T) ∼= Zn be the group of characters
of T, and let

Lie(G) = Mα∈X ∗(T)

Lie(G)α

be the Zn-grading on Lie(G) induced by the adjoint action of T. We call

the set of roots of G with respect to T.

Φ(T, G) = {α ∈ X ∗(T) | Lie(G)α 6= 0}

If G is a reductive algebraic group over k and T is a maximal split k-subtorus
of G, then Φ(T, G) \ {0} is a root system in the sense of Bourbaki [Bou81]
(see [BT65]). By abuse of language, we call Φ(T, G) a root system of G.

Let Φ be a root system and Π ⊆ Φ be a system of simple roots. For any α ∈ Φ

we write

α = Xβ∈Π

mβ(α)β,

where the coeﬃcients mβ(α) are either all non-negative, or all non-positive. Once
Π is ﬁxed, we denote the corresponding sets of positive and negative roots by Φσ.
Lemma 4.2.2. Let k be a ﬁeld, char k 6= 2, 3. Let G be an adjoint simple
2Li=−2Li be any

algebraic group over k. Let L = Lie(G) be its Lie algebra. Let L =
5-grading on L such that L1 ⊕ L−1 6= 0.
(i) There is a unique pair of opposite parabolic subgroups P± of G with unipotent
radicals U±, and a 1-dimensional split k-torus S ≤ Cent(P+∩ P−), such that
Lie(Pσ) = L0 ⊕ Lσ ⊕ L2σ, Lie(Uσ) = Lσ ⊕ L2σ, Lie(P+ ∩ P−) = L0,
and the adjoint action of S on Lie(G) induces the given 5-grading.

(ii) There is a maximal split k-subtorus T of G such that

Set Φ = Φ(T, G), then there is a system of simple roots Π ⊆ Φ and a non-
empty subset J ⊆ Π such that

S ⊆ T ⊆ P+ ∩ P−.

Φ(T, Pσ) = Φσ ∪(cid:0)Φ ∩ Z(Π \ J)(cid:1),
Φ(T, Uσ) = Φσ \ Z(Π \ J),
Φ(T, P+ ∩ P−) = Φ ∩ Z(Π \ J).

P

mβ (α)=i

β∈J

(iv) The type of the root system Φ ∩ ZJ is A1, BC1, A2, or A1 × A1.

Proof. First we prove (i). By Lemma 4.1.6, we have G = Aut(L)◦ and hence
it is a closed k-subscheme of End(L). Let S ∼= Gm be the grading torus of L. Since
S is connected, we have S ⊆ G.

By [DG70a, Exp. XXVI, Prop. 6.1] there is a unique pair of opposite parabolic

subgroups P± of G with a common Levi subgroup

such that

L = CentG(S) = P+ ∩ P−,

Lie(Pσ) = L0 ⊕ Lσ ⊕ L2σ, Lie(L) = L0.

Since Pσ is a semidirect product of L and the unipotent radical Uσ = Ru(Pσ), we
have

Lie(Uσ) = Lσ ⊕ L2σ.

Now we prove (ii). Let T be a maximal k-split torus of G containing S. Let
Φ = Φ(T, G) be the root system of G with respect to T. Since S ⊆ T, there is a
natural surjective homomorphism

π : X ∗(T) → X ∗(S) ∼= Z.

Since Lie(Pσ) = L0 ⊕ Lσ ⊕ L2σ, we have

Φ(T, Pσ) =(cid:8)α ∈ Φ | π(α) ∈ {0, σ, 2σ}(cid:9);

in particular, Φ(T, P+) = −Φ(T, P−). Then Φ(T, Pσ) \ {0} is a parabolic set of
roots in the sense of [Bou81, Ch. VI, §1, Déf. 4]. Then by [Bou81, Ch. VI, §1,
Prop. 20] there is a system of simple roots Π in Φ and a subset J of Π such that
Φ(T, Pσ) satisﬁes (4.15). Since

Φ(T, L) = Φ(T, P+ ∩ P−) = Φ(T, P+) ∩ Φ(T, P−)

and

the rest of (4.15) holds as well.

Φ(T, Uσ) = Φ(T, Pσ) \ Φ(T, P+ ∩ P−),

Now we prove (iii). Note that by (4.15) we have J ⊆ Φ(T, P+) \ Φ(T, L) and
Π \ J ⊆ Φ(T, L). Therefore, π(α) ∈ {1, 2} for any α ∈ J and π(α) = 0 for any
α ∈ Π\ J. Clearly, there is β ∈ J such that π(β) = 1, since otherwise L1⊕L−1 = 0.
Let γ ∈ Φ denote the sum of all simple roots. Then
π(β)

implies that |J| ≤ 2 and π(β) = 1 for all β ∈ J. Then for any α ∈ Φ we have

2 ≥ π(γ) ≥ Xβ∈J
π(α) = Xβ∈J

mβ(α).

This implies (4.16).

4.2. DEDUCING ALGEBRAICITY

57

In order to prove (iv), note that the root system Ψ = ZJ ∩ Φ has J as its
system of simple roots. Clearly, if |J| = 1, then Ψ has type A1 or BC1. If |J| = 2,
then π(β) ≤ 2 for any β ∈ Ψ readily implies that Ψ is of type A1 × A1 or A2. (cid:3)
We will need the following technical recognition lemma, which uses the algebra
of distributions Dist(G) associated to an algebraic k-group G (also known as the
hyperalgebra of G). This algebra is very well known to people working in repre-
sentation theory. Over a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, the representation theory of G
is essentially identical to the representation theory of its Lie algebra Lie(G), but
this is no longer true for ﬁelds of positive characteristic. The algebra Dist(G)
is a suitable replacement for Lie(G) in this case; for ﬁelds of characteristic 0, it
coincides with the universal enveloping algebra of Lie(G). We refer to [Tak74],
[DG70b, Chapter II, §4] or [Jan03, Chapter 7]. The idea to use the algebra of
distributions in our context came from the work of J. Faulkner on 3-graded Lie al-
gebras [Fau00, Fau04], and was previously applied to the study of (2n + 1)-graded
Lie algebras of algebraic groups in the third author’s thesis [Sta09].

Lemma 4.2.3. Let k be a ﬁeld such that n! ∈ k×. Let G be a smooth algebraic
group over k equipped with an action of Gm by k-automorphisms. Assume that the
induced Z-grading on Lie(G) is a (2n+1)-grading. Let H1, H2 be two Gm-invariant
smooth connected closed k-subgroups of G such that

Lie(H1) = Lie(H2) ⊆Mi>0

Lie(G)i.

Then H1 = H2.

Proof. Let H be an algebraic k-group, let Dist(H) be its k-Hopf algebra
of distributions, and denote the comultiplication in Dist(H) by ∆. Then Lie(H)
identiﬁes with the Lie algebra of primitive elements of Dist(H) [Tak74, Ch. 3,
Proposition 3.1.8]. Recall that an inﬁnite divided power sequence (abbreviated to
d.p.s.) in Dist(H) is a sequence of elements {ai}∞
i=0 such that a0 = 1 and for any
i ≥ 1,

∆(ai) = Xp+q=i

ap ⊗ aq.

If the ﬁeld k is perfect, then by [DG70b, Ch. II, §5, 2.3] Hred is a smooth k-sub-
group of H, and by [Tak74, Ch. 3, Corollary 3.3.12] the Lie algebra Lie(Hred) is
the set of elements a ∈ Lie(H) such that Dist(H) contains an inﬁnite d.p.s over a,
i.e. an inﬁnite d.p.s. {ai}∞

i=0 with a1 = a.

The Gm-action on G induces a Z-grading on Dist(G) compatible with the grad-
ing on Lie(G). The algebras Dist(H1) and Dist(H2) are Z-graded Hopf subalgebras
of Dist(G). One has H1 = H2 if and only if Dist(H1) = Dist(H2) by [Tak74, Ch. 3,
Corollary 3.3.9]. By [Tak74, Ch. 3, Proposition 3.1.7] the functor Dist commutes
with extensions of the base ﬁeld, so we can assume from the start that k = ¯k. In
particular, k is now perfect.

Let X = H1 ∩ H2 be the closed k-subgroup of G which is the intersection of
H1 and H2 as k-subgroup schemes of G. We have Dist(X) = Dist(H1) ∩ Dist(H2)
by [Tak74, Ch. 3, Corollary 3.3.9]. We will show that for any a ∈ Lie(X) there
is an inﬁnite d.p.s. over a in Dist(X). Then Lie(Xred) = Lie(H1) = Lie(H2), and

58

consequently Xred = H1 = H2 by [DG70b, Ch. II, §5, Corollary 5.6], since H1
and H2 are connected.

Let H be any of H1, H2, G. Since H is smooth, we have Hred = H, and
hence for any x ∈ Lie(H) there is an inﬁnite d.p.s. over x in Dist(H). By [Fau00,
Lemma 4(i)], moreover, if x ∈ Lie(H)j, j ∈ Z, then there exists a homogeneous
inﬁnite d.p.s. over x, i.e. a d.p.s. {xi}∞
i=0 such that xi ∈ Dist(H)i·j for any i ≥ 0.
We show by induction on m, 0 ≤ m ≤ n, that there is a homogeneous d.p.s.

{x(k)}∞
k! xk for any 0 ≤ k ≤ m.
The case m = 1 is already known. Assume the claim for m; we will prove it for
m + 1 ≤ n. Since x is a primitive element, we have

(m+1)! xm+1 − x(m+1)(cid:1).
(m+1)! xm+1 − x(m+1) is a primitive element of Dist(H). Hence
This means that
there is a homogeneous d.p.s. {yk}∞
(m+1)! xm+1 − x(m+1) in Dist(H).
By [Fau00, Lemma 2] the sequence {zk}∞
k=0 where zk = yk/m+1 if m + 1 | k and
zk = 0 otherwise, is also a homogeneous d.p.s. Again by [Fau00, Lemma 2], the

k=0 and {yk}∞
k=0
be two homogeneous d.p.s. over x in Dist(H1) and Dist(H2) respectively, satisfying
xk = yk = 1
k! xk for any 1 ≤ k ≤ n. We claim that these two sequences are equal.
Indeed, assume that this is true for all k ≤ m, where m ≥ n. Then

yi ⊗ yj

This means that xm+1 − ym+1 is primitive element in Dist(G). Since, clearly,
xm+1 − ym+1 is homogeneous of degree j(m + 1), and Lie(G) is (2n + 1)-graded, we
have xm+1− ym+1 = 0. Proceeding by induction, we show that {xk}∞

The Lie algebra L is isomorphic to Der(L) by Lemma 4.1.6(ii), hence it contains
a grading derivation. Then we can apply Lemma 3.1.3 to L. It implies that the

The following lemma is an easy corollary of the previous one combined with

Theorem 4.1.1.

Lemma 4.2.5. Let A be a central simple structurable algebra over a ﬁeld k of
characteristic 6= 2, 3. Let ¯k be the algebraic closure of k. Then A is algebraic if and
only if the simple Lie algebra K(A)⊗k ¯k is isomorphic to a simple Lie algebra over
¯k of Chevalley type (i.e. the commutator Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of a split
adjoint algebraic ¯k-group, cf. Lemma 4.1.6).

60

4. SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS AND SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

Proof. If A is algebraic, the Lie algebra K(A) ⊗k ¯k has the desired form by
Theorem 4.1.1. Assume that K(A) ⊗k ¯k is isomorphic a simple Lie algebra over ¯k
of Chevalley type. Then by Lemma 4.2.4(i) the Lie algebra K(A)⊗k ¯k is algebraic.
Since the natural inclusion K(A) → K(A)⊗k ¯k preserves the Lie bracket, it follows
that K(A) is algebraic, and hence A is algebraic.

(cid:3)

Relying on Lemma 4.2.5, we can investigate the algebraicity of central simple
structurable algebras over a ﬁeld of characteristic 5. We approach this problem by
relating algebraicity to the existence of absolute zero divisors. In the course of the
proof, we use the classiﬁcation of simple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed
ﬁeld of characteristic ≥ 5 [PS07, PS08b].

(i) Let A be a structurable algebra over a ﬁeld k of char-
Definition 4.2.6.
acteristic 6= 2, 3. An element x ∈ A is called an absolute zero divisor if Uxy = 0
for any y ∈ A. The algebra A is called non-degenerate if it has no non-trivial
absolute zero divisors.
(ii) Let L be a Lie algebra over a ﬁeld k. An element x ∈ L is called an absolute
x = 0. The Lie algebra L is called non-degenerate if it has

zero divisor if ad2
no non-trivial absolute zero divisors.

If an element x ∈ K(A)σ = Aσ is an absolute zero divisor of K(A), then it
is represented by an absolute zero divisor of A; this follows from the fact that by
Deﬁnition 2.4.1,

for all x, y ∈ A.

[xσ, [xσ, y−σ]] = −Vx,yx ∈ Aσ

Lemma 4.2.7. Let A be a central simple structurable algebra over a ﬁeld k of
characteristic 5. Let ¯k be an algebraic closure of k, and let ks ⊆ ¯k be a separable
closure of k. Then the following conditions are equivalent.
(a) A is algebraic.
(b) A ⊗k ¯k is non-degenerate.
(c) A ⊗k ks is non-degenerate.
(d) K(A) ⊗k ¯k is non-degenerate.
(e) K(A) ⊗k ks is non-degenerate.

Proof. By the classiﬁcation of simple ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebras over an
algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic 5, any such algebra is a Lie algebra of
Chevalley (also called classical), Cartan, or Melikian type [PS07, PS08b]. Among
these Lie algebras, only the Lie algebras of Chevalley type are non-degenerate [Sel67,
p. 124], while all simple Lie algebras of Cartan and Melikian type are degenerate
(this observation goes back to A. I. Kostrikin and A. Premet; see e.g. [Wil76]
and [Str09, Corollary 12.4.7]). Since K(A) ⊗k ¯k is a simple ¯k-Lie algebra, it fol-
lows from Lemma 4.2.5 that

K(A) is algebraic ⇐⇒ A is algebraic ⇐⇒ K(A) ⊗k ¯k is non-degenerate.

In particular, we have (a) ⇔ (d).

Next, for any ﬁeld extension k′/k, by [GGLN11, Corollary 2.5] K(A) ⊗k k′ is
non-degenerate if and only if the associated Kantor pair (A−⊗k k′,A+⊗k k′) is non-
degenerate. The latter is by deﬁnition equivalent to the fact that the structurable

4.2. DEDUCING ALGEBRAICITY

61

algebra A ⊗k k′ is non-degenerate. In particular, this shows that (b) ⇔ (d) and
(c) ⇔ (e).
Since the implication (d) ⇒ (e) is trivial, it only remains to show (e) ⇒ (d).
Pick x ∈ K(A)⊗k ¯k such that ad2
x = 0. Let F denote the Frobenius automorphism
of ¯k. It induces a k-linear automorphism of K(A) ⊗k ¯k and of End¯k(K(A) ⊗k ¯k) ∼=
Endk(K(A)) ⊗k ¯k. Since ¯k/ks is purely inseparable, there is n ≥ 1 such that
F n(x) ∈ K(A)⊗k ks inside K(A)⊗k ¯k. Clearly, F n(ad2
F n(x) = 0. Therefore,
F n(x) = 0, and hence x = 0.
(cid:3)

x) = ad2

We can now apply our results to deduce that structurable division algebras are

always algebraic.

Theorem 4.2.8. Let A be a central simple structurable division algebra over a

ﬁeld k of characteristic 6= 2, 3. Then A is algebraic.

Proof. By Lemma 3.1.7 we only need to consider the case char k = 5. By
Lemma 4.2.7, it is enough to show that K(A)⊗k ks contains no non-trivial absolute
zero divisors. Assume the opposite. Then, clearly, there is a ﬁnite Galois extension
k′/k such that K(A)⊗k k′ contains non-trivial absolute zero divisors. The argument
in the second half of the proof of [GGLN11, p. 450, Theorem 2.4] now shows that
there is, in fact, a non-trivial absolute zero divisor x ∈ (A−⊕A+)⊗k k′. (Notice that
the Lie algebra called L0 in that proof is equal to(cid:0)K(A)−2⊕K(A)0⊕K(A)2(cid:1)⊗k k′,
and that the subspace called L1 is equal to (cid:0)K(A)−1 ⊕ K(A)1(cid:1) ⊗k k′.)
Write x = x+ + x−, x+ ∈ A+ ⊗k k′, x− ∈ A−⊗k k′. Then for any homogeneous
element a ∈ K(A)i, we rewrite [x, [x, a]] = 0 as
0 = [x−, [x−, a]] +(cid:0)[x−, [x+, a]] + [x+, [x−, a]](cid:1) + [x+, [x+, a]]
∈(cid:0)K(A)i−2 ⊕ K(A)i ⊕ K(A)i+2(cid:1) ⊗k k′,
and we conclude that x+ and x− are are absolute zero divisors of K(A) ⊗k k′. In
particular, K(A) ⊗k k′ contains a non-trivial absolute zero divisor of grading ±1.
Let Di, −2 ≤ i ≤ 2, denote the k′-linear span of absolute zero divisors in
K(A)i ⊗k k′. By [GGLN11, Lemma 2.1(i)] the Lie bracket of two absolute zero
divisors is again an absolute zero divisor, hence D = P2
i=−2 Di is a 5-graded Lie
subalgebra of K(A) ⊗k k′. This graded Lie subalgebra D is invariant under all
graded Lie algebra automorphisms of K(A) ⊗k k′, and hence is deﬁned over k by
Galois descent (see e.g. [Loo75, §15.1]). In other words, there is a 5-graded k-Lie
subalgebra C =P2
The pair of k-vector spaces (C−2,C2) has a structure of a Jordan pair over k
induced by the Lie bracket in K(A). Since A is a structurable division algebra,
(C−2,C2) is a Jordan division pair in the sense of [Loo75]. Therefore, its Jacobson
radical Rad(C−2,C2) equals 0 by [Loo75, Proposition 4.4]. Since k′/k is separable,
by [Loo75, §15.2] one has

i=−2 Ci of K(A) such that Ci ⊗k k′ = Di for each −2 ≤ i ≤ 2.

Rad(C−2,C2) ⊗k k′ = Rad(cid:0)C−2 ⊗k k′,C2 ⊗k k′(cid:1) = Rad(D−2,D2).

On the other hand, the subspaces D2σ are spanned by absolute zero divisors of
K(A) ⊗k k′ contained in K(A)2σ ⊗k k′, and hence (D−2,D2) = Rad(D−2,D2).
Therefore, D2σ = 0, and hence C2σ = 0.

62

4. SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS AND SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

Since C2σ = 0, the pair of k-vector spaces (C−1,C1) also has a structure of a
Jordan pair over k induced by the Lie bracket of K(A). Again, it is a Jordan
division pair, since A is division, and by the same token as above we conclude that
Dσ = 0. However, this is not possible, since we have established that K(A) ⊗k k′
contains a non-trivial absolute zero divisor of grading ±1. We have arrived to a
contradiction, and the theorem is proved.
(cid:3)

4.3. Structurable division algebras from simple algebraic groups of

k-rank 1

In this section, we prove a partial converse to Theorem 4.1.1. Namely, we
show that for any adjoint simple algebraic group G of k-rank 1 over a ﬁeld k of
characteristic 6= 2, 3, there is a structurable division algebra A over k such that

G ∼= Aut(K(A))◦.

Moreover, such an algebra A is unique up to isotopy. Recall that by Theorem 4.2.8
all structurable division algebras over k are algebraic.

Our main result is the following theorem.

Theorem 4.3.1. Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic 6= 2, 3. The assignment

A 7→ G = Aut(K(A))◦

deﬁnes a one-to-one correspondence between isotopy classes of central simple struc-
turable division algebras A over k, and isomorphism classes of adjoint simple alge-
braic k-groups G of k-rank 1.

In the proofs of Theorem 4.3.1 and of the preliminary lemmas, we will exten-

sively use notation of Deﬁnition 4.2.1 and Lemma 4.2.2.

Lemma 4.3.2. Let k be a ﬁeld, char k 6= 2, 3. Let G be an adjoint simple
2Li=−2Li be

algebraic group over k. Let L = Lie(G) be its Lie algebra, and let L =
any 5-grading on L such that L1 ⊕ L−1 6= 0. Then
(i) L′ = [L,L] is a Z-graded ideal of L and L′
(ii) [Lσ,Lσ] = L2σ.
(iii) [Lσ,L−σ] = L′
0.

i = Li for all i 6= 0.

Proof. We can assume from the start that k = ¯k is algebraically closed. We
apply the results of Lemma 4.2.2 in this situation. Then G is a split group, T is a
split maximal torus of G, and Φ = Φ(T, G) is a reduced root system.

Since L′ is a characteristic ideal of L, it is Z-graded. By Lemma 4.1.6, L′ has
codimension ≤ 1 in L. Assume that M ⊆ L is a 1-dimensional graded complement
to L′. Since Φ+ = −Φ−, the equalities (4.15) then imply that dim(L1 ⊕ L2) =
dim(L−1 ⊕ L−2), and hence M ⊆ L0. This proves (i).

In order to prove (ii), note that we can choose basis elements eα ∈ Lα, α ∈ Φ,

so that if α, β, α + β ∈ Φ, then
(4.17)

[eα, eβ] = ±peα+β,

4.3. STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS FROM SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS OF k-RANK 163

where p is the smallest positive integer such that β − pα 6∈ Φ (see e.g. [DG70a,
Exp. XXIII, Corollaire 6.5]). Since p ∈ {1, 2, 3}, we always have p ∈ k×. Then by
Lemma 4.2.2(iii), it is enough to show that for any α ∈ Φ such thatPβ∈J mβ(α) = 2
there are γ, δ ∈ Φ such that Pβ∈J mβ(γ) =Pβ∈J mβ(δ) = 1 and γ + δ = α. This

is proved in [PS08a, Lemma 2].

Now we prove (iii). By Lemma 4.1.6 L′ is a simple Lie algebra, therefore

L′
0 = [L−1,L1] + [L2,L−2].
Using (ii), we deduce that L′
0 = [L−1,L1], since
(cid:2)[L1,L1], [L−1,L−1](cid:3) ⊆(cid:2)L1, [L1, [L−1,L−1]](cid:3)
⊆(cid:2)L1, [[L1,L−1],L−1](cid:3) ⊆ [L1, [L0,L−1]] ⊆ [L1,L−1]. (cid:3)
Lemma 4.3.3. Let k be a ﬁeld of characteristic diﬀerent from 2, 3. Let G be
an adjoint simple algebraic group over k. Let L = Lie(G) be its Lie algebra, and
2Li=−2 Li be any 5-grading on L such that L1 ⊕ L−1 6= 0. Let ζ ∈ L be the
let L =
grading derivation. Then (L1,L−1) is a Kantor pair in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.2.2
with respect to the triple product operation Lσ × L−σ × Lσ → Lσ given by

{x, y, z} = −[[x, y], z],

and its standard 5-graded Lie algebra g = g(L1 ⊕ L−1) is canonically isomorphic to
the graded subalgebra [L,L] + kζ of L.

Proof. By Theorem 3.2.3 in order to check that (L1,L−1) is a Kantor pair,
it is enough to check that L1 ⊕ L−1 is sign-graded Lie triple system with the triple
product given by (3.8). It is clear that L1 ⊕ L−1 considered as a k-subspace of the
5-graded Lie algebra L is a sign-graded Lie triple system with respect to the triple
product [x, y, z] = [[x, y], z]. Since this triple product satisﬁes the equations (3.8),
we conclude that (L1,L−1) is indeed a Kantor pair.

Let g = g(L1 ⊕ L−1) be the 5-graded Lie algebra which is the standard graded
embedding of the Lie triple system L1 ⊕ L−1 as described in § 3.2. Let δ ∈ g0 be
the grading derivation of g. Note that there is a homomorphism of Lie algebras

φ : L → Der(L1 ⊕ L−1) ⊕ (L1 ⊕ L−1)

such that φ|L1⊕L−1 = idL1⊕L−1 , and for any x ∈ L2 ⊕ L0 ⊕ L−2 we have

φ(x) = ad(x)|L1⊕L−1 ∈ Der(L1 ⊕ L−1).

By Lemma 4.1.6 [L,L] is simple, hence φ|[L,L] is injective. Then for any non-zero
x ∈ L and u ∈ [L,L], the element [φ(x), φ(u)] = φ([x, u]) of φ([L,L]) is non-zero
as soon as [x, u] is non-zero. Since L = Der([L,L]) by the same Lemma 4.1.6, we
conclude that φ is injective on the whole of L.

Observe that δ and φ(ζ) act on L1 ⊕ L−1 in the same way, hence δ = φ(ζ). By

Lemma 4.3.2 [L,L] is the subalgebra of L generated by L1 and L−1. Therefore,

and hence g is isomorphic to kζ + [L,L] ⊆ L.

(cid:3)

g = kφ(ζ) + φ([L,L]),

64

4. SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS AND SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

Lemma 4.3.4. In the setting of Lemma 4.3.3, assume moreover that G has
k-rank 1. Then there is a structurable division algebra A over k such that the Kantor
pair (L1,L−1) is the Kantor pair associated with A in the sense of Remark 3.2.4.
Proof. We use the notation of Lemma 4.3.3. By [AF99, Corollary 15 and
p.541] a Kantor pair is associated with a structurable algebra A if and only if
the standard 5-graded Lie algebra g = g(L1 ⊕ L−1) of this Kantor pair contains
an element (x, 0) ∈ gσ ⊕ g2σ that is one-invertible, i.e.
there are (y, t), (z, r) ∈
g−σ ⊕ g−2σ such that the element
(4.18)
satisﬁes n(ζ) = −ζ. By Lemma 3.2.15 in order to show that A is division, it is
enough to show that any element (x, 0) ∈ gσ ⊕ g2σ has this property. Note that by
Lemma 4.3.3 we can assume that

e−σ(y, t)eσ(x, 0)e−σ(z, r) = n ∈ End(g)

g = [L,L] + kζ ⊆ L.
By Lemma 4.3.2 we have gσ = Lσ and g2σ = L2σ.

Let Pσ, S, T, Φ, Π, J etc. be as in Lemma 4.2.2. Since G has k-rank 1, S = T
is a maximal split k-subtorus of G. Then Φ is of type A1 or BC1, and J = Π = {β}.
By Lemma 4.2.4 for any (x, s) ∈ Lσ ⊕ L2σ the map eσ(x, s), considered as an
endomorphism of L, belongs to Uσ(k), and, conversely, any element of Uσ(k) is of
this form. Then by the Bruhat decomposition [BT65, Théorème 5.15] there are
(y, t), (z, r) ∈ L−σ ⊕ L−2σ such that

e−σ(y, t)eσ(x, s)e−σ(z, r) = n ∈ NormG(S)(k),

where n acts on Φ as the Weyl reﬂection sending β to −β (the only non-trivial
element of the Weyl group). Then by Lemma 4.2.2(iii) the adjoint action of n on L
satisﬁes n(Li) = L−i for any −2 ≤ i ≤ 2. Consequently, n(ζ) = −ζ. Since, clearly,
n preserves the Lie subalgebra [L,L] of L, it also preserves g ⊆ L. This shows that
the element (x, s) of g is one-invertible.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 4.3.1. The proof will be divided into three steps.

Step 1. If A is a central simple structurable division algebra over k, then

G = Aut(K(A))◦ is an adjoint simple algebraic k-group of k-rank 1.

Set L = Lie(G). By Theorem 4.1.1 the k-group G is indeed an adjoint simple

algebraic k-group, and K(A) = [L,L].
It remains to show that G has k-rank 1. Let S ⊆ Aut(K(A)) be the grading
torus of K(A). Since S ∼= Gm is connected, we have S ⊆ G. Thus, the k-rank of
G is ≥ 1.

Since A is algebraic, eσ(x, s) ∈ G(k) for any (x, s) ∈ K(A)σ ⊕ K(A)2σ. Since
A is division, Theorem 3.3.7 implies that any (x, s) 6= (0, 0) is one-invertible. This
implies the existence of n ∈ G such that n(K(A)i) = K(A)−i for any i ∈ Z.
Consequently, n acts on S by inversion. Therefore, if we consider the Z-grading on
the whole of L induced by the adjoint action of S, then n(Li) = L−i for any i ∈ Z.
Since K(A) = [L,L] has codimension at most 1 in L by Lemma 4.1.6, its graded
complement lies in degree 0.

4.3. STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS FROM SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS OF k-RANK 165

Let T ⊆ G be a maximal split k-subtorus of G containing S. Then L de-
composes into a direct sum of root subspaces Lα, α ∈ Φ(T, G). Since the graded
complement of K(A) in L lies in degree 0, we have K(A)α = Lα for any α 6= 0.
Then it is shown exactly as in [All86b, Theorem 3.1], “(ii)⇒(iii)” that Φ(T, G) has
rank 1 (this part of the proof does not use the char k = 0 assumption included in
the statement of Allison’s theorem). This implies that G has k-rank 1.

Step 2. For any adjoint simple algebraic k-group G of k-rank 1 there is an
algebraic central simple structurable division algebra A over k such that G ∼=
Aut(K(A))◦.

Set L = Lie(G). Let T be a maximal split subtorus of G. Since G has k-rank 1,
T is 1-dimensional, and the root system Φ = Φ(T, G) has to be of type A1 or BC1.
Let β ∈ Φ be a simple root. For any −2 ≤ i ≤ 2 set
(4.19)
Clearly, this is a 5-grading on L with L1 ⊕ L−1 6= 0. By Lemma 4.3.3 (L1,L−1) is
a Kantor pair in the sense of [AF99] with respect to the triple product operation
Lσ × L−σ × Lσ → Lσ given by

Li = Liβ.

{x, y, z} = −[[x, y], z],

and the Lie subalgebra [L,L] + kζ ⊆ L, where ζ ∈ L is the grading derivation, is
the corresponding 5-graded Lie algebra g(L1 ⊕ L−1). By Lemma 4.3.4 there is a
structurable division algebra A over k such that (L1,L−1) ∼= (A,A) is the Kantor
pair associated with A in the sense of Remark 3.2.4. In particular, we have a natural
isomorphism of graded Lie algebras

[L,L] ∼= K(A).

By Lemma 4.1.6 the Lie algebra [L,L] is central simple, and

G ∼= Aut([L,L])◦ ∼= Aut(K(A))◦.

Since K(A) is central simple, by [All79, Corollaries 6 and 9] the algebra A is central
simple. By Lemma 4.2.4, A is algebraic.

Step 3. Isotopic structurable algebras give rise to isomorphic simple algebraic

groups, and vice versa.

By Theorem 2.5.2 structurable algebras A and A′ over k are isotopic if and only
if K(A) and K(A′) are isomorphic as graded Lie algebras. This readily implies
that if A and A′ are isotopic, then the k-groups G = Aut(K(A))◦ and G′ =
Aut(K(A′))◦ are isomorphic.

Conversely, assume that G and G′ are two isomorphic adjoint simple k-groups.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that G = G′. By Theorem 4.1.1 we have

K(A) = K(A′) = [Lie(G), Lie(G)].

Let S (respectively, S′) be the 1-dimensional split k-subtorus of G which is the grad-
ing torus of the 5-graded algebra K(A) (respectively, K(A′)). Since the k-rank of G
is 1, both S and S′ are maximal split subtori of G, and hence they are conjugate by
an element g ∈ G(k). The adjoint action of g on L preserves [L,L], and transforms
the canonical grading of K(A) into the canonical grading of K(A′). Therefore,

66

4. SIMPLE STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS AND SIMPLE ALGEBRAIC GROUPS

K(A) and K(A′) are isomorphic as graded Lie algebras. Then by Theorem 2.5.2
the algebras A and A′ are isotopic.

CHAPTER 5

Moufang sets and structurable division algebras

We ﬁnally come to the main goal of the paper. We will show that every struc-
turable division algebra A over a ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, 3 gives rise to a Moufang
set M(A) (Theorem 5.1.6), and conversely, that every Moufang set arising from a
linear algebraic k-group of k-rank 1 is isomorphic to M(A) for some structurable di-
vision algebra A (Theorem 5.2.1). Recall that by Theorem 4.2.8, every structurable
division algebra A over a ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, 3 is algebraic.

5.1. Moufang sets from structurable division algebras

We will make the connection with Moufang sets through rank one groups; see

Lemma 1.1.3. We continue to use the terminology introduced in section 3.2.

Theorem 5.1.1. Let A be a structurable division algebra over a ﬁeld k of
characteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3. Then the elementary group G of A is an
abstract rank one group with unipotent subgroups U+ and U−.

Proof. By deﬁnition, G = hU+, U−i. Next, we observe that U+ and U− are

nilpotent subgroups (of nilpotency class 2), since by Lemma 3.2.7

(cid:2)[eσ(x, s), eσ(y, t)], eσ(z, r)(cid:3) = [eσ(0, 2ψ(x, y)), eσ(z, r)] = 0

for all x, y, z ∈ A and all s, t, r ∈ S.

Now let (x, s) ∈ A×S \{(0, 0)}, let σ = ±1, and let a = eσ(x, s) ∈ Uσ \{0}. By
Corollary 3.3.8 (x, s) is one-invertible; thus by Deﬁnition 3.2.11 there exist unique
elements y, z ∈ A, t ∈ S such that
(5.1)
Deﬁne b(a) := e−σ(−y,−t) = h−1e−σ(z, t)a. Then using Lemma 3.2.9(i) we obtain

h := e−σ(z, t) eσ(x, s) e−σ(y, t) ∈ H−.

σ = U e−σ(z,t)a
U b(a)

−σ

= (U−σ)a.

By Deﬁnition 1.1.2, this shows that G is an abstract rank one group with unipotent
subgroups U+ and U−.
(cid:3)

Applying Lemma 1.1.3 to the abstract rank one group of the previous theorem,
we obtain a Moufang set M. We will use Construction 1.1.5 to give an explicit
description of this Moufang set in the form M(U, τ ) with τ a permutation of U\{0}.
The groups U+ and U− are root groups of the Moufang set we constructed. We
begin with deﬁning an addition on A× S such that A ×S is a group isomorphic to
U+ and U−.

67

68

5. MOUFANG SETS AND STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS

Definition 5.1.2. Let U := A × S be the (non-abelian) group with addition

(x, s) + (y, t) = (x + y, s + t + ψ(x, y)).

By Lemma 3.2.7(ii), U ∼= U+ ∼= U−. We will also write 0 for (0, 0) ∈ U, and we will
use the notation U ∗ for U \ {0}.

For each element u = (x, s) ∈ U, we set

e+(u) = e+(x, s)

and e−(u) = e−(x, s).

Construction 5.1.3.
(i) Let G = hU+, U−i be the abstract rank one group
from Theorem 5.1.1. Then the set Y of the Moufang set M obtained from
Lemma 1.1.3 is given by

Y = {(U−)e+(u) | u ∈ U} ∪ {U+}.
We identify Y with X = U ∪ {∞} through the map

(U−)e+(u) ←→ u
U+ ←→ ∞.

The action of elements in G = hU+, U−i on Y is given by conjugation, and
this induces an equivariant action of G on X = U ∪ {∞}. We denote

U∞ := ∞ = U+ and U0 := 0 = U−.

(ii) Let a ∈ U, then the unique element in U∞ mapping 0 to a is given by αa =

e+(a). Indeed, e+(a) ∈ U∞ and

(0)e+(a) = (U−)e+(0)e+(a) = (U−)e+(a) = a.

It follows that for all a, b ∈ U we have a+b = aαb and U ∼= U∞ = {αa | a ∈ U}.
(iii) For each u = (x, s) ∈ U ∗, we deﬁne µu to be the unique element in the double
coset U0αuU0 interchanging the elements 0 and ∞ of X (see (1.1) on page 2).
By (5.1) and Lemma 3.2.9(i), we have

(5.2)

µu = µ(x,s) = e−(z, t) e+(x, s) e−(y, t) ∈ H−,

where (y, t) = (u − tx, t) and (z, t) = (u + tx, t) are the left and right inverse
of (x, s), respectively.

(iv) Let e = (1, 0) ∈ U ∗, and deﬁne τ = µe. Then U0 = U τ
∞.

As in (ii), we let αu = e+(u) for each u ∈ U; then
and U0 = {ατ

U∞ = {αu | u ∈ U}

u | u ∈ U}.

Our next goal is to describe the action of τ on U ∗ explicitly. First we determine
the action of τ on the Lie algebra g.

Lemma 5.1.4. The automorphism τ = µ(1,0) ∈ H− is equal to the “gradation
ﬂipping” automorphism ϕ deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.2.8. In particular, τ is an invo-
lution, and for each u ∈ U, we have e−(u) = e+(u)τ .

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that the left and right inverse of e = (1, 0) are both

equal to e = (1, 0) again, and hence

τ = µ(1,0) = e−(1, 0) e+(1, 0) e−(1, 0) ∈ H−.

Since τ ∈ H−, we have ζ.τ = −ζ. We now verify that τ maps every element x ∈ g±
to the corresponding element x ∈ g∓.

5.1. MOUFANG SETS FROM STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS

69

Indeed, by Theorem 3.2.13(iii), we know that τ|g+ = P(1,0) and τ|g− = P(1,0),

which we can compute explicitly. We get, for all a ∈ g±,

P(1,0)a = U1(a + 2

3 ψ(1, a)1) = U1(a + 2

3 (a − a)1)

= 1

3 U1(a + 2a) = 1

3 (2(a + 2a) − (a + 2a)) = a ∈ g∓.

Since τ is an automorphism of g, we ﬁnd for all s ∈ g±2 that

4 [s, 1].τ = − 1

4 [s.τ, 1.τ ] = 1

2 ψ(s, 1) = s ∈ g∓2,

s.τ = 1

2 ψ(s, 1).τ = − 1
and for all a ∈ g+, b ∈ g− that

Va,b.τ = − 1

2 [a, b].τ = − 1

2 [a.τ, b.τ ] = 1

2 [b, a] = −Vb,a.

We conclude that τ = ϕ, which is clearly an involution. Since τ ∈ H−, it follows
from Lemma 3.2.9(i) that

e+(x, s)τ = e−(x.τ, s.τ ) = e−(x, s)

for all (x, s) ∈ U.

(cid:3)

We can now determine the action of τ on U ∗ using Lemma 1.1.8.
Theorem 5.1.5. The map τ = µ(1,0) maps each element (x, s) ∈ U ∗ to (−y,−t),

where (y, t) is the left inverse of (x, s).

Proof. Let u = (x, s) ∈ U ∗ be arbitrary. By (5.2) and Lemma 5.1.4, we have

(z,t) α(x,s) ατ
On the other hand, it follows from Lemma 1.1.8 that

µu = µ(x,s) = ατ

(y,t).

µu = ατ

(−u)τ −1 αu ατ

−(uτ −1).

By the uniqueness of the µ-maps (see (1.1)), we conclude that

The lemma follows since τ is an involution.

(x, s).τ −1 = (−y,−t).

(cid:3)

We can now prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 5.1.6. Let A be a structurable division algebra over a ﬁeld of char-

acteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3. Deﬁne the group U := A × S with addition

(x, s) + (y, t) = (x + y, s + t + ψ(x, y)).

Let

qx : S → S : s 7→

1
6

ψ(x, Ux(sx)),

and deﬁne the permutation τ of U ∗ by

(x, 0) 7→ (−ˆx, 0),
(0, s) 7→ (0,−ˆs),

(x, s) 7→ (cid:16)ˆs(cid:0)(qˆx(s) + ˆs)∧ ˆx(cid:1) +(cid:0)s + qx(ˆs)(cid:1)∧

x, −(cid:0)s + qx(ˆs)(cid:1)∧(cid:17).

for all 0 6= x ∈ A and 0 6= s ∈ S. Then M(U, τ ) is a Moufang set, which is isomor-
phic to the Moufang set induced by the abstract rank one group from Theorem 5.1.1.
We will denote this Moufang set by M(A).

70

5. MOUFANG SETS AND STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS

Proof. Let M be the Moufang set induced by the abstract rank one group
from Theorem 5.1.1, let U be as in Deﬁnition 5.1.2, and let τ = µ(1,0) be as in
Construction 5.1.3(iv). Then by Theorem 5.1.5, we can explicitly compute τ , using
the formulas for the left inverse of (x, s) in Corollary 3.3.8. The formula we obtain
is precisely the formula given in the statement of the theorem.
(cid:3)

As an easy corollary, we can show that these Moufang sets are special if and only
if they have abelian root groups, which conﬁrms that [DMS09, Conjecture 7.2.1],
the “special implies abelian conjecture” for Moufang sets, holds for the examples
arising from structurable division algebras.

Definition 5.1.7. A Moufang set M(U, τ ) is called special if (−x).τ = −(x.τ )

for all x ∈ U ∗.

Corollary 5.1.8. Let A be a structurable division algebra over a ﬁeld of char-
acteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3, and let M = M(A) be the corresponding Moufang
set. Then M is special if and only if it has abelian root groups, i.e., if and only if
A is a Jordan division algebra.

Proof. Observe that, by Lemma 1.1.8 and (5.2) on page 68, M is special if

and only if the left inverse and the right inverse of each element coincide.

Recall that A is a Jordan division algebra if and only if S = 0. If this holds,
then indeed the left and right inverse are both equal to the usual inverse in the
Jordan algebra.

Conversely, assume that S 6= 0, and consider (1, s) ∈ A × S for some s 6= 0.
Then by Theorem 3.2.13(ii), the left and right inverse of (1, s) are (u − t, t) and
(u + t, t), respectively, and since t 6= 0 by Lemma 3.3.1, we conclude that M is not
special.
(cid:3)

Remark 5.1.9. If A and A′ are isotopic structurable algebras over k, then
by Theorem 2.5.2, the Lie algebras K(A) and K(A′) are graded isomorphic.
It
follows from Lemma 1.1.12 and Theorem 5.1.1 that the Moufang sets constructed
by Theorem 5.1.6 from A and A′ are isomorphic. Up to a ﬁeld isomorphism, the
converse of this fact is also true; see Corollary 5.2.7 below.

We will now determine the Hua maps of the Moufang set M(A); see Deﬁni-

tion 1.1.9. We get a (surprisingly) elegant expression.

Theorem 5.1.10. Let A be a structurable division algebra over a ﬁeld of char-

acteristic diﬀerent from 2 and 3, and let M(A) be as in Theorem 5.1.6. Then

(a, r).h(x,s) =(cid:0)P(x,s)a, qx(r) + ψ(x, s(rx)) − s(rs)(cid:1)

for all (x, s) ∈ U ∗ and all (a, r) ∈ U.

=(cid:0)P(x,s)a, 1

2 ψ(P(x,s)r, P(x,s)1)(cid:1).

Proof. Let (x, s) ∈ U ∗, let (a, r) ∈ U, and let (y, t) and (z, t) denote the left
and right inverse of (x, s), respectively. By deﬁnition, h(x,s) = τ µ(x,s) ∈ Aut(g);
notice that h(x,s) preserves the gradation of g. Hence

e+(a, r)h(x,s) = e+(cid:0)a.h(x,s), r.h(x,s)(cid:1).

5.2. STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS FROM ALGEBRAIC MOUFANG SETS

71

On the other hand, by Lemma 5.1.4,

e+(a, r)h(x,s) = e−(a, r)µ(x,s) = e+(cid:0)a.µ(x,s), r.µ(x,s)(cid:1).

Combining the last two equalities, we ﬁnd that

(5.3)

(a.r).h(x,s) =(cid:0)a.µ(x,s), r.µ(x,s)(cid:1);

notice that the elements a and r in the right hand side expression have to be
interpreted as elements of g− and g−2, respectively (but x ∈ g+ and s ∈ g+2).

By Construction 5.1.3(iii), we have µ(x,s) = e−(z, t) e+(x, s) e−(y, t). By Theo-
rem 3.2.13(iii), we have µ(x,s)|g− = P(x,s). Hence in (5.3) we ﬁnd a.µ(x,s) = P(x,s)a.
Since µ(x,s) is a Lie algebra homomorphism, we have

r.µ(x,s) = 1

2 [r, 1].µ(x,s) = 1

2 [r.µ(x,s), 1.µ(x,s)] = 1

2 ψ(P(x,s)r, P(x,s)1),

proving the second formula in the statement of the theorem.

Using the theory developed in [AF99], we can obtain another equivalent for-
mula. Indeed, in the proof of [AF99, Theorem 12] it shown that for h = µ(x,s) =
e−(z, t)e+(x, s)e−(y, t), we have h|g−2 = ǫ2e+(x, s)|g−2 , where ǫ2 denotes the pro-
jection g → g−2. In the proof of [AF99, Theorem 13] it is shown that1

ǫ2e+(x, s)|g−2 = 1

24 ad(x)4 + 1

2 ad(x)2 ad(s) + 1

2 ad(s)2.

Using the deﬁnition of the Lie bracket of g, we now ﬁnd

r.µ(x,s) = 1

6 ψ(x, Ux(rx)) + ψ(x, s(rx)) − s(rs),

proving the ﬁrst formula in the statement of the theorem.

(cid:3)

5.2. Structurable division algebras from algebraic Moufang sets

In this section, we will verify that every Moufang set arising from a linear
algebraic group of k-rank one, as described in Theorem 1.2.1, is indeed isomorphic
to a Moufang set M(A) for some structurable division algebra A, as described in
Theorem 5.1.6. Due to the work we have done in section 4.3, this will only be a
matter of combining some of our earlier results.

Theorem 5.2.1. Let k be a ﬁeld with char(k) 6= 2, 3, and let G be a semisimple
linear algebraic group of k-rank one. There is a ﬁnite separable ﬁeld extension l/k
and a central simple structurable division algebra A over l such that M(G) ∼= M(A).
Lemma 5.2.2. Let A be an algebraic simple structurable algebra over a ﬁeld k of
characteristic 6= 2, 3. Let G = Aut(K(A))◦ be the adjoint simple algebraic k-group
of Theorem 4.1.1. Let g be the 5-graded Lie algebra of Deﬁnition 3.2.1(ii), and let
G = hU+, U−i be the elementary group of Deﬁnition 3.2.8. Then there exist
(i) natural inclusions K(A) ⊆ g ⊆ Lie(G) of 5-graded k-Lie algebras;
(ii) a k-group isomorphism

(5.4)

G ∼= Aut(g)◦

induced by the restriction of the adjoint action of G on Lie(G) to g;

(iii) two opposite parabolic k-subgroups Pσ of G with unipotent radicals Uσ such

that the isomorphism (5.4) restricts to isomorphisms Uσ(k) ∼= Uσ;
(iv) an isomorphism of groups hU+(k), U−(k)i ∼= G induced by (5.4).

1This can be easily veriﬁed from the deﬁnition of e+(x, s).

72

5. MOUFANG SETS AND STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS

Proof. Set L = Lie(G). By Deﬁnition 3.2.1(i), the Lie algebras K(A) and
K ′(A) are graded-isomorphic. We identify K(A) with a graded Lie subalgebra
of g via this isomorphism. By Theorem 4.1.1 we have K(A) = [L,L] and by
2Li=−2Li be the 5-grading
Corollary 4.1.9 we have L ∼= Der(K(A)) ∼=
on L induced by the isomorphism with ^K(A). Then K(A) is a 5-graded subalgebra
of L. Let ζ ∈ L be the grading derivation. Then, clearly, g ∼= K(A)+kζ is naturally
isomorphic to a 5-graded Lie subalgebra of L. This settles (i).

^K(A). Let L =

In order to prove (ii), note that by Lemma 4.1.6(i) K(A) = [L,L] is of codimen-
sion ≤ 1 in L. Therefore, we have g = K(A) or g = L. Then by Lemma 4.1.6(ii)
we have G ∼= Aut(g)◦.

Now we prove (iii) and (iv). Since K(A)σ 6= 0, we have L1 ⊕ L−1 6= 0, and
hence by Lemma 4.2.2 there are two opposite parabolic k-subgroups Pσ of G with
unipotent radicals Uσ, such that

Lie(Pσ) = L0 ⊕ Lσ ⊕ L2σ

By Lemma 4.2.4 we have

and Lie(Uσ) = Lσ ⊕ L2σ.

Uσ(k) = {eσ(x, s) | (x, s) ∈ Lσ ⊕ L2σ},

If g = L, this means
where eσ(x, s) is considered as an element of End(L).
exactly that Uσ = Uσ(k).
If g = K(A) is of codimension 1 in L, note that
g = K(A) + kζ is invariant under eσ(x, s) ∈ End(L). Then, since the restric-
tion map r : G ∼= Aut(L)◦ → Aut(g)◦ is an isomorphism, we conclude that r maps
Uσ(k) isomorphically onto Uσ ≤ Aut(g)(k). Thus, (iii) is proved. Now the claim
of (iv) follows, since by deﬁnition G is the subgroup of Aut(g)(k) generated by U+
and U−.
(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem 5.2.1. The algebraic k-group G′ = G/ Cent(G) is an
adjoint semisimple k-group, and the natural projection p : G → G′ is a central
k-isogeny. By Lemma 1.2.5 M(G) ∼= M(G′). Also by Lemma 1.2.5 there is a ﬁnite
separable ﬁeld extension l/k and an adjoint simple algebraic l-group H such that
M(G′) ∼= M(H). Thus, we can assume that G is an adjoint simple group over k
from the start.

By Theorem 4.3.1 there is a central simple structurable division algebra A
over k (unique up to isotopy) such that G ∼= Aut(K(A))◦. Let g be the 5-graded
Lie algebra of Deﬁnition 3.2.1(ii), and let G = hU+, U−i be the elementary group
of Deﬁnition 3.2.8. By Lemma 5.2.2 there is an isomorphism of k-groups φ : G
−→
Aut(g)◦, and there is a pair of opposite parabolic k-subgroups Pσ of G with unipo-
tent radicals Uσ such that φ induces isomorphisms Uσ(k) ∼= Uσ. By deﬁnition of
M(G), the subgroup hU+(k), U−(k)i of G(k) is an abstract rank one group corre-
sponding to M(G). By Theorem 5.1.1 the group G = hU+, U−i is an abstract rank
one group. By deﬁnition, M(A) is the Moufang set corresponding to G. Clearly, φ
induces an isomorphism of the abstract rank one groups hU+(k), U−(k)i and G =
hU+, U−i that preserves their unipotent subgroups. Therefore, by Lemma 1.1.12
the Moufang sets M(G) and M(A) are isomorphic.
(cid:3)

∼

Notation 5.2.3. Let λ : k → k′ be a homomorphism of ﬁelds. For any k-algebra
R, we denote by λR the k′-algebra R ⊗k k′ which is the scalar extension of R by

5.2. STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS FROM ALGEBRAIC MOUFANG SETS

73

means of λ. Note that

R 7→ λR

is a covariant functor from the category of k-algebras to the category of k′-algebras.
Restricting this functor to the category of commutative k-algebras, we obtain a
covariant functor from the category of aﬃne k-schemes to the category of aﬃne
k′-schemes that we denote by λ∗ (the base change functor). Note that if A is the
dual k-Hopf algebra of an algebraic k-group G, i.e. G = Spec A, then

λ∗(G) = Spec(λA).

We also denote by λ∗ : G(R) → λ∗(G)(λR) the canonical homomorphism of the
groups of points.

∼

Remark 5.2.4. Observe that in the setting of Notation 5.2.3, if k = k′ and
−→ k is a ﬁeld automorphism, then we can identify λR and R as rings (via the
λ : k
canonical ring isomorphism), but the scalar multiplication in λR is given by the
formula t · x = λ(t)x, t ∈ k, x ∈ R.

Remark 5.2.5. Let G be a linear algebraic k-group together with a k-repre-
sentation φ : G → GLn,k. Then we can identify the group λ∗(G) with the subgroup
of GLn,k′ given by equations obtained by applying λ to the equations determining
φ(G). In this setting, the abstract group homomorphism λ∗ : G(k) → λ∗(G)(k′) is
the map that applies λ to each entry of matrices representing the elements of G(k).
Theorem 5.2.6. Let k and k′ be two ﬁelds of characteristic 6= 2, 3. Let G
be an adjoint absolutely simple algebraic k-group of k-rank 1, and let G′ be an
adjoint absolutely simple algebraic k′-group of k′-rank 1. Let X and X ′ be the
sets of proper parabolic subgroups of G and G′ respectively. Let φ : X → X ′ be a
bijection that induces an isomorphism φ : M(G) ∼−→ M(G′) of Moufang sets. Then
there are a unique ﬁeld isomorphism λ : k ∼−→ k′, and an isomorphism of k′-groups
f : λ∗(G) ∼−→ G′ such that f ◦ λ∗|X = φ.

Proof. Let P and Q be two opposite proper parabolic k-subgroups of G.
Let P′ = φ(P) and Q′ = φ(Q′) be the corresponding parabolic k′-subgroups of
G′. By Lemma 1.2.4 the groups G(k)+ = hRu(P)(k),Ru(Q)(k)i and G′(k′)+ =
hRu(P′)(k′),Ru(Q′)(k′)i are the little projective groups of M(G) and M(G′). Then
by Lemma 1.1.12(iii) φ induces a group isomorphism φ+ : G(k)+ ∼−→ G′(k)+. We
will show the existence of λ and f as in the claim of the theorem satisfying f ◦
λ∗|G(k)+ = φ+.

Note that the ﬁelds k and k′ are both inﬁnite or both ﬁnite, since the group

Ru(P)(k) is inﬁnite or ﬁnite depending on whether k is inﬁnite or ﬁnite.

Assume ﬁrst that both k and k′ are inﬁnite. By [BT73, Théorème 8.11(i)]
the existence of the injective homomorphism φ+ : G(k)+ → G′(k′) implies that
there is a ﬁeld isomorphism λ : k ∼−→ k′ and a k′-isogeny f : λ∗(G) → G′ such
that f ◦ λ∗|G(k)+ = φ+. By [BT73, (3.3) and Théorème 8.11(iii)], λ is a central
k′-isogeny, since char k′ 6= 2, 3. It remains to note that in our particular case, both
groups λ∗(G) and G′ are adjoint and absolutely simple, and therefore the k′-isogeny
f is an isomorphism.

From now on, we assume that both k and k′ are ﬁnite. In this case by Lang’s
theorem G and G′ are quasi-split. Since G and G′ are absolutely simple and

74

5. MOUFANG SETS AND STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS

have rank 1 over the base ﬁeld, this implies that G and G′ have type A1 or 2A2.
Then, since the characteristic of the base ﬁelds is diﬀerent from 2, 3, the groups
G(k)+ and G′(k′)+ are ﬁnite simple groups of Lie type of the form PSL2(q) or
PSU3(q2), where q = pn, n ≥ 1, is a power of the characteristic of the respective
base ﬁeld. The assumption on the characteristic also implies that there are no
exceptional automorphisms between such ﬁnite simple groups [Wil09], therefore,
G(k)+ ∼= G′(k′)+ ∼= E, where E is one of the groups PSL2(q) or PSU3(q) for a
ﬁxed q. In particular, k ∼= k′ ∼= Fq, and both G and G′ are Fq-isomorphic to the
algebraic Fq-group H, where H = PGL2,Fq or H = PGU3,Fq , depending on the type
of E.

We identify k with Fq, G with H and G(k)+ with E. Note that any two
pairs of opposite parabolic subgroups in G are conjugate, therefore, we can assume
that P and Q are the two opposite Borel subgroups of upper triangular and lower
triangular matrices in the standard presentation of H by equivalence classes of 2× 2
matrices with entries in Fq, or, respectively, of 3 × 3 matrices with entries in Fq2.
∼−→ G′ that takes the pair (P, Q) to the
Fix any isomorphism of Fq-groups α : H
pair (P′, Q′), and denote α+ = α|E. Then (α+)−1 ◦ φ+ ∈ Aut(E). The group
Aut(E) is known by [Ste60, 3.2]; we consider two cases.

If H = PGL2,Fq and E = PSL2(q), then by [Ste60, 3.2] there is a unique ﬁeld
automorphism λ ∈ Aut(Fq) and an element g ∈ H(Fq) such that (α+)−1 ◦ φ+ =
g◦ λ+, where g acts on E ≤ H(Fq) by conjugation and λ+ acts on the 2× 2 matrices
representing E = PSL2(q) by applying λ to each entry. Note that by Remark 5.2.5
the Fq-group λ∗(H) naturally identiﬁes with H, so that λ+ is the restriction of the
canonical abstract group homomorphism λ∗ : H(Fq) → λ∗(H)(Fq). Consider the
matrix class g as an element of λ∗(H)(Fq) instead of H(Fq); then the conjugation
by g induces an Fq-automorphism of λ∗(H). Summing up, we have φ+ = f ◦ λ∗|E,
where f = α ◦ g : λ∗(H) → G′ is an isomorphism of Fq-groups.

Now assume that H = PGU3,Fq and E = PSU3(q). Let F : Fq2 → Fq2 be the
Frobenius automorphism. Then F n, where q = pn, is an involutory automorphism
of Fq. Consider the Fq2-automorphism τ of PGL3,F
q2 induced by the automorphism
of GL3,F
q2 that is the composition of the transpose, the inverse and conjugation
by the 3 × 3 matrix e13 − e22 + e31. We identify the group H = PGU3,Fq with
q2 stabilized by the automorphism τ ◦ F n. Clearly, we have
the subgroup of PGL3,F
τ 2 = id, τ ◦ F = F ◦ τ and τ (PGU3,Fq ) = F n(PGU3,Fq ) = PGU3,Fq . Consequently,
F n|H = τ|H is an Fq-automorphism of H. By [Ste60, 3.2] there is a unique ﬁeld
automorphism λ ∈ Aut(Fq2 ) and an element g ∈ H(Fq) such that (α+)−1 ◦ φ+ =
g ◦ λ+, where g acts on E ≤ H(Fq) by conjugation and λ+ acts on the 3 × 3
matrices representing E = PSU3(q) ≤ PSL3(q2) by applying λ to each entry. One
has λ = F l, where 0 ≤ l < 2n. Set µ = λ|Fq = F l mod n|Fq . As in the previous
case, the Fq2 -group λ∗(PGL3,F
q2 , so that the
corresponding abstract group homomorphism λ∗ restricts to λ+. Since the natural
q2 is compatible with the inclusion
group scheme homomorphism PGU3,Fq → PGL2,F
of the respective base ﬁelds Fq → Fq2, the above identiﬁcation restricts to an
identiﬁcation of the Fq-groups µ∗(H) and H. If l < n, then λ+ coincides with the
restriction of µ∗ : H(Fq) → µ∗(H)(Fq) and we conclude that φ+ = (α ◦ g) ◦ µ∗|E
as in the previous case. If n ≤ l < 2n, then λ+ = F n ◦ µ∗|E, and hence φ+ =

q2 ) naturally identiﬁes with PGL3,F

and G′.

Corollary 5.2.7. Let k and k′ be two ﬁelds of characteristic 6= 2, 3. Let A and
A′ be two central simple structurable division algebras over k and k′ respectively.
Then M(A) ∼= M(A′) if and only if there is an isomorphism of ﬁelds λ : k ∼−→ k′
such that λA and A′ are isotopic as structurable algebras over k′.

Proof. By Theorem 4.3.1, G = Aut(K(A))◦ and G′ = Aut(K(A′))◦ are ad-
joint absolutely simple algebraic groups of relative rank 1 over k and k′, respectively.
By Lemma 5.2.2, the Moufang sets corresponding to G and G′ are isomorphic to
the Moufang sets corresponding to A and A′, respectively, since the corresponding
rank one groups coincide. Also, observe that for any ﬁeld isomorphism λ : k ∼−→ k′,
there are isomorphisms of k′-groups

Aut(K(λA))◦ ∼= Aut(λK(A))◦ ∼= λ∗(cid:0)Aut(K(A))◦(cid:1).

Therefore, λA belongs to the isotopy class of structurable algebras corresponding
to the k′-group λ∗(G) in the sense of Theorem 4.3.1. Now the claim of the corollary
readily follows from Theorem 5.2.6; see also Remark 5.1.9.

Examples

We will now describe the Moufang sets for each of the classes of structurable
algebras as described in section 2.3. In each case, we will also point out what the
corresponding linear algebraic groups are. We assume throughout this section that
(A, ) is a structurable division algebra over a ﬁeld k with char(k) 6= 2, 3.

6.1. Associative algebras with involution

Notice that any associative algebra with involution is, in fact, a hermitian
structurable algebra for which the hermitian space W is trivial. We will therefore
include this case in section 6.3 below; see Remark 6.3.1.

6.2. Jordan algebras

Recall that a structurable algebra (A, ) is a Jordan algebra if and only if the
is trivial, and that in this case A is a Jordan division algebra, with
involution
ˆx = x−1, where x−1 is the Jordan inverse in J. Then S = 0, and by Theorem 5.1.6,
U is the additive group of J and x.τ = −ˆx = −x−1 for x ∈ U ∗. We thus recover
the Moufang sets described in Theorem 1.3.2.

The corresponding linear algebraic groups of k-rank one are precisely those for
which the k-root groups are abelian; recall in particular that M(J) is the Moufang
set of an exceptional linear algebraic group of type E78
7,1 if J is an exceptional Jordan
division algebra (see Example 1.3.5(ii)), and that it arises from a classical linear
algebraic group in all other cases.

6.3. Hermitian structurable algebras

Let A = E⊕W be a structurable division algebra of hermitian type; see section
2.3.3. In particular, E is an associative division algebra with involution , and W
is a left E-module equipped with a hermitian form h, such that h(x, x) 6= 0, 1 for
all 0 6= x ∈ W . Notice that we allow the case W = 0, in which case A = E, i.e.
A is itself an associative algebra with involution; see section 6.1 and Remark 6.3.1
below.

For the sake of readability, we introduce the notation
π(e + w) = ee − h(w, w) ∈ H(E),

for all e ∈ E and w ∈ W ; notice that this makes π into a (hermitian) pseudo-
quadratic form on A. By (2.17), we have \e + w = π(e + w)−1(e − w) and

π(bx) = π(x)−1

77

78

6. EXAMPLES

for all 0 6= x = e + w ∈ A. Using formulas (2.15) and (2.16), it is a straightforward
calculation to verify that

qx(s) = π(x)sπ(x) ∈ S

for all x ∈ A and all s ∈ S(E), where qx is as in Deﬁnition 3.3.3.

Now we apply Theorem 5.1.6. It follows that U = A × S(E) with the group

operation (denoted by +) given by

(6.1)

(e1 + w1, s1) + (e2 + w2, s2)

=(cid:0)e1 + e2 + w1 + w2, s1 + s2 + e1e2 − e2e1 + h(w2, w1) − h(w1, w2)(cid:1).
Next, for all 0 6= x = e + w ∈ A and all 0 6= s ∈ S, we have (x, s).τ = (−u + tx,−t),
where (u, t) is as in Theorem 3.3.7. We simplify the expressions for u and t using
the associativity of E and the identity (a + b)−1a(a − b)−1 = (a − ba−1b)−1:

t = (s + qx(ˆs))∧ = (s + π(x)s−1π(x))

−1

= (−s + π(x)s−1π(x))−1 = (π(x) + s)−1s(π(x) − s)−1.

The expression for u simpliﬁes to

u = −ˆs(cid:0)(ˆs + qbx(s))∧ ˆx(cid:1)
= s−1(cid:0)(s−1 − π(x)−1sπ(x)−1)−1π(x)−1(e − w)(cid:1)
=(cid:0)π(x)−1 − sπ(x)−1s(cid:1)−1
= (π(x) + s)−1π(x)(π(x) − s)−1(e − w).

(e − w)

Therefore

(6.2)

(x, s).τ =(cid:16)−(π(x) + s)−1e + (π(x) − s)−1w,

− (π(x) + s)−1s(π(x) − s)−1(cid:17).
Notice that this formula remains valid if either x = 0 or s = 0. Indeed, if x = 0 then
we get (0, s).τ = (0, s−1), and if s = 0, we get (x, 0).τ = (−π(x)−1e+π(x)−1w, 0) =
(−\e + w, 0), which is consistent with the formulas for these cases in Theorem 5.1.6.
Remark 6.3.1. If W = 0, then A = E, so U = E ×S(E) with group operation

given by

and also the formula for τ simpliﬁes slightly, to

(e1, s1) + (e2, s2) = (e1 + e2, s1 + s2 + e1e2 − e2e1),
(e, s).τ =(cid:16)−(ee + s)−1e, −(ee + s)−1s(ee − s)−1(cid:17).

Remark 6.3.2. The Moufang sets arising from hermitian structurable algebras
with non-trivial involution are precisely the Moufang sets of skew-hermitian type
as introduced in Deﬁnition 1.4.2 (up to isomorphism). The description given there
looks much simpler than the description we just obtained. It requires some eﬀort
to produce an explicit isomorphism between the two descriptions, so we sketch the
procedure.

Let D be a skew ﬁeld with involution σ, let V be a non-trivial right D-module,
and let h : V × V → D be an anisotropic skew-hermitian form on V . Let Dσ be the
subspace of elements of D ﬁxed by σ, and let S be the subspace of skew elements

6.4. STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS OF SKEW-DIMENSION ONE

79

of D (i.e. the elements negated by σ). Fix an arbitrary element ξ ∈ V \{0}, and let
s0 := −2h(ξ, ξ)−1 ∈ S. We deﬁne a new involution ρ on D given by aρ := s0aσs−1
for all a ∈ D. Notice that left multiplication by s0 induces a bijection from Dσ to
Sρ(D) := {a ∈ D | aρ = −a}.

We now make V into a left D-module by deﬁning a∗ v := vaρ for all v ∈ V and

0

all a ∈ D. The form

H := 1

2 s0h : V × V → D

is now a hermitian form (for this left scalar multiplication) with respect to the
involution ρ.

We now identify D with the subspace D ∗ ξ of V , so we get V = D ⊕ D⊥. We
can now make V into a structurable division algebra A of hermitian type, with the
choice E = D and W = D⊥ and with hermitian form H restricted to W × W .
When we write elements v, w ∈ V as v = e + v′ ∈ D ⊕ W and w = f + w′ ∈ D ⊕ W ,
then we get

h(v, w) = −2s−1

0 (cid:0)ef ρ − H(v′, w′)(cid:1).

The isomorphism between the root group Uh = {(v, a) ∈ V × D | h(v, v) = a − aσ}
and the root group UA = A × Sρ(D) is given by

ϕ : Uh → UA : (v, a) 7→(cid:0)v, s0(a − 1

2 h(v, v))(cid:1).

It is now a matter of computation to verify that ϕ is a group isomorphism, and that
ϕ transforms the map τ from Deﬁnition 1.4.2 into the map τ from equation (6.2).

Corollary 6.3.3. Every Moufang set arising from a hermitian structurable
algebra with non-trivial involution is isomorphic to a Moufang set arising from
a classical linear algebraic group of relative type BC1 (i.e. with non-abelian root
groups).

Conversely, every Moufang set arising from a classical linear algebraic group of
relative type BC1 is isomorphic to a Moufang set arising from a hermitian struc-
turable algebra with non-trivial involution.

Proof. This now follows from Remark 6.3.2 together with Corollary 1.4.5.
Notice that the root groups of a Moufang set arising from a structurable division
algebra (A, ) are abelian if and only if the involution
(cid:3)

is trivial.

6.4. Structurable algebras of skew-dimension one

We will now have a closer look at the exceptional groups for which the corre-
sponding structurable division algebra has skew-dimension one. From Table 1 on
page 8, we know that these are the groups with Tits index 3,6D9
7,1 or
E133
8,1 . To the best of our knowledge, not all corresponding structurable division
algebras have been explicitly constructed, so in most cases, we will have to content
ourselves with the description of the algebra after a suitable scalar extension. We
will only be able to give a complete answer for groups of type 3,6D9

4,1, 2E35

6,1, E66

4,1.

Some of these forms are given by the Cayley–Dickson process (see Deﬁni-
tion 2.3.8), speciﬁcally of the form CD(J, µ) where J is a Jordan division alge-
bra with a Jordan norm of degree 4, and dim(J) = 4, 10, 16, 28.
(Notice that
dim(J) − 1 = 3, 9, 15, 27.) However, see Remark 2.3.10.

80

6. EXAMPLES

6.4.1. Forms of type 3,6D9

4,1 arise
from the Cayley–Dickson process. We ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of a quartic Cayley
algebra from [All90b, Section 9].

4,1. As we will see, all forms of type 3,6D9

Definition 6.4.1. A quartic Cayley algebra is a simple structurable algebra
of skew-dimension 1, degree 4, and dimension 8. Equivalently, a structurable al-
gebra is a quartic Cayley algebra if and only if it is isotopic to CD(B, µ) for some
separable commutative associative algebra B of dimension 4 and some µ ∈ k×; see
Deﬁnition 2.3.8.

Observe that a structurable algebra arising from a hermitian form over an
associative algebra E with involution σ as in Deﬁnition 2.3.1 has skew-dimension
1, degree 4, and dimension 8 if and only if E is a quaternion algebra and σ is a
non-standard involution (i.e. H(E) is 3-dimensional). The following proposition
determines when a quartic Cayley algebra is also of hermitian type.

Proposition 6.4.2. Let (A, ) be a quartic Cayley algebra A = CD(B, µ). The

following are equivalent:
(a) A is isotopic to a structurable algebra of hermitian type;
(b) A is isomorphic to a structurable algebra of hermitian type;
(c) B contains a 2-dimensional unital subalgebra.

Proof. Since an isotope of a structurable algebra of hermitian type is again

of hermitian type, (a) and (b) are equivalent.

(b) ⇒ (c).

By assumption, there is an isomorphism ϕ : A → A′ for some
hermitian structurable algebra A′ = E ⊕ W arising from a hermitian form h : W ×
W → E; see Deﬁnition 2.3.1. As we observed, this implies that E is a quaternion
algebra with non-standard involution σ, and W is a 1-dimensional left E-module.
In particular, A′ = E ⊕ W contains B′ := ϕ(B), which is a 4-dimensional separable
commutative associative unital subalgebra. Since B ⊂ H(A), we also have B′ ⊂
H(A′) = H(E) ⊕ W .

We will show that B′ ∩ E is a 2-dimensional unital subalgebra of B′. Let
a = e + w ∈ B′ be a generator for B′ over k. In particular, a is associative, i.e.
a2a = aa2; see [All90b, Section 7]. Explicitly expressing this equality in the algebra
A′ using the formulas in Deﬁnition 2.3.1 gives eh(w, w) = h(w, w)e. (Notice that
eσ = e because a ∈ H(A′).) Let K be the unital subalgebra of E generated over k
by e and h(w, w). Since e and h(w, w) commute, we have dimk K ≤ 2.
By [All90b, Theorem 7.3], B′ = k[a] = k ⊕ ka ⊕ ka2 ⊕ ka3. Since

a2 =(cid:0)e2 + h(w, w)(cid:1) + 2ew,
a3 =(cid:0)e3 + 3eh(w, w)(cid:1) +(cid:0)3e2 + h(w, w)(cid:1)w,

we see that B′ = k[a] ⊆ K ⊕ Kw ⊂ E ⊕ W . Since dimk B′ = 4, this now implies
that dimk K = 2, so B′ = K ⊕ Kw, and K = B′ ∩ E is a subalgebra of B′. Hence
ϕ−1(K) is a 2-dimensional unital subalgebra of B.

(c) ⇒ (b). We now assume that B contains a 2-dimensional unital subalgebra
K. Let b0 ∈ B be a generator for B over K with TB/K(b0) = 0; then δ := b2
0 ∈ K
and B = K ⊕ b0K. Moreover, TB/k(b0K) = 0 since TB/k = TK/k ◦ TB/K. Also
observe that TB/k↾K = 2TK/k.

6.4. STRUCTURABLE ALGEBRAS OF SKEW-DIMENSION ONE

81

Recall that A = B ⊕ s0B. Deﬁne

E := K ⊕ s0K ⊂ A and W := b0K ⊕ s0 · b0K ⊂ A,

and notice that A = E ⊕ W . Let B0 be the subspace of trace zero elements of B,
i.e. B0 := {b ∈ B | TB/k(b) = 0}. Also recall from Deﬁnition 2.3.8 that the
involution on A is given by b1 + s0b2 = b1 − s0bθ
2 TB/k(b) for all
b ∈ B. In particular, we see that H(A) = B ⊕ s0B0 and hence also W ⊂ H(A).
Moreover, if t ∈ K, then tθ = −b + TK/k(t) = tσ, where σ is the unique non-trivial
k-automorphism of K. In particular, the restriction of θ to K is multiplicative.

2 where bθ = −b + 1

We claim that E is a subalgebra of A which is a quaternion algebra, and that
the involution of A restricts to a non-standard involution on E. Indeed, the ﬁrst
claim follows immediately from the multiplication formula
2 t4) + s0(tσ

(t1 + s0t2)(t3 + s0t4) = (t1t3 + µtσ

1 t4 + t2t3)

(6.3)

arising from the formula in Deﬁnition 2.3.8 because θ is multiplicative. The second
claim follows from the observation that the involution of A maps t1+s0t2 to t1−s0tσ
2 ,
which is indeed a non-standard involution on E.

We now want to make W into a 1-dimensional E-module. We deﬁne a left

action • of E on W by the rule

(t1 + s0t2) • (b0t3 + s0 · b0t4) := b0(cid:0)t1t3 − µtσ

2 t4(cid:1) + s0 · b0(cid:0)tσ

1 t4 − t2t3(cid:1)

for all t1, t2, t3, t4 ∈ K. In particular, (t1 + s0t2) • b0 = b0t1 − s0 · b0t2. It is easily
checked that • indeed makes W into a left E-module w.r.t. the multiplication (6.3).
Now let h : W × W → E be the unique hermitian form on W such that
h(b0, b0) = δ. By deﬁnition, this means that h(e1 • b0, e2 • b0) = e1δe2 for all
x1, x2 ∈ E. It now only requires some calculations, using the formulas in Deﬁni-
tion 2.3.8, to verify that

e + w = e + w,

(e1 + w1)(e2 + w2) = (e1e2 + h(w2, w1)) + (e2 • w1 + e1 • w2),

for all e, e1, e2 ∈ E and all w, w1, w2 ∈ W . Comparing this with Deﬁnition 2.3.1
shows that A is isomorphic to the hermitian structurable algebra corresponding to
h.
(cid:3)

We are now ready to describe the Moufang sets arising from groups of triali-

tarian type D4.

Theorem 6.4.3. Let B/k be a 4-dimensional separable quartic ﬁeld extension
whose splitting ﬁeld has Galois group Alt4 or Sym4, and let µ ∈ k×\ NB/k(B)(k×)2.
Then A = CD(B, µ) is a structurable division algebra, and M(A) is a Moufang set
arising from a linear algebraic group of type 3D9
4,1, depending on whether
the Galois group is Alt4 or Sym4, respectively. Moreover, every Moufang set arising
from a linear algebraic group of type 3,6D9

4,1 can be obtained in this fashion.

4,1 or 6D9

Proof. For ﬁelds of characteristic zero, this follows from [All90a, Theo-
rem 9.4] in the context of Lie algebras. An approach for arbitrary ﬁelds of charac-
teristic 6= 2 in the context of algebraic groups was obtained in [Gar98], but without
the explicit description of the corresponding structurable algebras.

82

6. EXAMPLES

Assume that B/k is a 4-dimensional separable quartic ﬁeld extension whose
splitting ﬁeld has Galois group Alt4 or Sym4, let µ ∈ k× \ NB/k(B)(k×)2, and let
A = CD(B, µ). Observe that by the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the
condition on the Galois group implies that B/k does not admit quadratic subﬁelds.
Therefore, [All86b, Theorem 6.3] tells us that the condition on µ implies that A
is a division algebra. By [All90b, Theorem 9.1], A is a quartic Cayley division
algebra.

By Proposition 6.4.2, A is not isotopic to a hermitian structurable algebra.
Therefore, by Corollary 6.3.3, the Moufang set M(A) is a Moufang set arising from
an exceptional algebraic group. Comparing dimensions using Table 1 on page 8, we
conclude that the algebraic group is necessarily of type 3,6D9

4,1.

Conversely, assume that M(A) is the Moufang set arising from an exceptional
algebraic group of type 3,6D9
4,1. Then A is a structurable division algebra of di-
mension 8 and skew-dimension 1. By [All90b, Proposition 4.4], the degree of A
is either 2 or 4. By [All90b, Theorem 4.11(c)] however, the degree of A cannot
be equal to 2. By [All90b, Theorem 9.1], this implies that A is a quartic Cayley
algebra. Since isotopic structurable algebras give rise to isomorphic Moufang sets,
we may assume (by [All90b, Theorem 9.1] again) that A ∼= CD(B, µ) for some sep-
arable commutative associative 4-dimensional k-algebra B and some µ ∈ k×. Since
A is a division algebra, also B is a division algebra, i.e. B/k is a separable quar-
tic ﬁeld extension, and by [All86b, Theorem 6.3], µ 6∈ NB/k(B)(k×)2. Moreover,
Proposition 6.4.2 implies that B does not admit quadratic subﬁelds.

It remains to show that the splitting ﬁeld of B/k has Galois group Alt4 or
Sym4. The only other possibilities for the Galois group are Cyc4 or Dih8. In both
cases, however, B/k would admit quadratic subﬁelds (by the fundamental theorem
of Galois theory), which we had excluded.
(cid:3)

6,1, E66

6.4.2. Forms of type 2E35

8,1 . The structurable division al-
gebras corresponding to forms of type 2E35
7,1 or E133
8,1 are algebras of skew-
dimension one, and of dimension 20, 32 and 56, respectively. Since not all corre-
sponding structurable division algebras have been explicitly constructed, we can
currently do no better than the following result.

7,1 and E133
6,1, E66

Theorem 6.4.4. Let A be a structurable division algebra over k, and assume
that there is a quadratic ﬁeld extension E/k such that A ⊗k E is isomorphic to a
matrix structurable algebra M (J, η) as introduced in Deﬁnition 2.3.3, where J is a
Jordan algebra associated with a non-degenerate cubic norm structure of dimension
9, 15 or 27, respectively. Then M(A) is a Moufang set arising from a linear algebraic
group of type 2E35

8,1 , respectively.

7,1 or E133

6,1, E66

Moreover, every Moufang set arising from a linear algebraic group of type 2E35
6,1,

E66

7,1 or E133

8,1 can be obtained in this fashion.

Proof. First assume that A is a structurable division algebra over k, and
assume that there is a quadratic ﬁeld extension E/k such that A⊗k E is isomorphic
to a matrix structurable algebra M (J, η) where J is a Jordan algebra associated
with a non-degenerate cubic norm structure of dimension 9, 15 or 27, respectively.
By [All90b, Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2], A has degree 4, and by [All90b, Theorem 4.11],

6.5. FORMS OF THE TENSOR PRODUCT OF TWO COMPOSITION ALGEBRAS

83

this implies that A is not of hermitian type. Therefore, M(A) is the Moufang set
of a linear algebraic group of exceptional type. Since dim(A) is equal to 20, 32 or
56, respectively, an inspection of Table 1 reveals that we are in type 2E35
7,1 or
E133
8,1 .

6,1, E66

6,1, E66

7,1 or E133

Conversely, assume that M(A) is the Moufang set of a linear algebraic group
of type 2E35
8,1 . Then it follows again from Table 1 that A has skew-
dimension 1, and moreover A is not of hermitian type. It now follows from [All90b,
Theorem 4.11] again that A does not have degree 2. By Corollary 2.3.5, there ex-
ists a quadratic ﬁeld extension E/k such that A ⊗k E is isomorphic to a matrix
structurable algebra M (J, η). Since deg(A) 6= 2, [All90b, Lemma 4.2] now implies
that J has a non-zero norm, and by Deﬁnition 2.3.3, this means that J is a Jor-
dan algebra associated with a non-degenerate cubic norm structure. Comparing
dimensions, we ﬁnally obtain that J has dimension 9, 15 or 27, respectively.
(cid:3)

6.5. Forms of the tensor product of two composition algebras

Let (A, ) be a structurable division algebra which is a form of a tensor product
of two composition algebras; see section 2.3.5. If we assume moreover that A is
not an associative algebra with involution, then by Proposition 2.3.14, we know
that either A is an (8, m)-product algebra with m ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}, or A is a twisted
(8, 8)-product algebra, and in this case there is a quadratic extension E/k such that
A ⊗k E is isomorphic to an (8, 8)-product algebra.

These algebras correspond precisely to the rank one forms of the exceptional

groups which have skew-dimension greater than 1:

4,1, X1 = 2E29

Proposition 6.5.1. Let X0 = F 21

7,1 and X3 = E91
8,1.
Let A be a structurable division algebra over k, and let G = Aut(K(A))◦ be the
corresponding linear algebraic group of k-rank 1, as in Theorem 4.1.1. Then for
each i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, the following are equivalent.
(a) G has type Xi;
(b) A is an (8, m)-product algebra with m = 2i, or a twisted (8, 8)-product algebra

6,1, X2 = E49

(when i = 3).

Proof. Notice that both (a) and (b) imply that

(dimA, dim S) ∈ {(8, 7), (16, 8), (32, 10), (64, 14)},

(6.4)
according to whether i = 0, 1, 2, 3 respectively. In particular, dimS > 1. The result
now follows since we already know that the classical linear algebraic groups with
non-abelian root groups correspond precisely to the case where A is of hermitian
type (including the associative algebras with involution).
(cid:3)

Remark 6.5.2. Notice that the only case in which the dimensions (6.4) do not
uniquely determine the type of G is the case (dim A, dimS) = (32, 10). Indeed, if
A is of hermitian type, then A = E ⊕ W and S = SE, where E is a central simple
division algebra of degree n, and W is an E-module, so dim A is divisible by n2
and dim S = n(n ± 1)/2 (where the sign depends on the type of the involution).
Comparing this with (6.4), this only leaves the possibility (dimA, dimS) = (32, 10)
and n = 4.

84

6. EXAMPLES

(i) Let A be an octonion division algebra over k equipped
Corollary 6.5.3.
with the standard involution. Then M(A) is a Moufang set arising from a
linear algebraic group of type F 21
4,1. Moreover, every Moufang set arising from
a linear algebraic group of type F 21

4,1 can be obtained in this fashion.

(ii) Let E/k be a separable quadratic ﬁeld extension with Galois involution σ, let
A be an octonion division algebra over E with standard involution ρ, and
equip A with the involution σ ⊗ ρ of the second kind over E. Then M(A) is
a Moufang set arising from a linear algebraic group of type 2E29
6,1. Moreover,
every Moufang set arising from a linear algebraic group of type 2E29
6,1 can be
obtained in this fashion.

(iii) Let A be a division algebra which is the tensor product of an octonion divi-
sion algebra and a quaternion division algebra. Then M(A) is a Moufang set
arising from a linear algebraic group of type E49
7,1. Moreover, every Moufang
set arising from a linear algebraic group of type E49
7,1 can be obtained in this
fashion.

(iv) Let A be a division algebra which is the tensor product of two octonion division
algebras, or which is isomorphic to such an algebra after extending scalars to
some separable quadratic extension ﬁeld E/k. Then M(A) is a Moufang set
arising from a linear algebraic group of type E91
8,1. Moreover, every Moufang
set arising from a linear algebraic group of type E91
8,1 can be obtained in this
fashion.

Remark 6.5.4. In cases (i) and (ii) from Corollary 6.5.3, we recover the known
results from [DMVM10] and [CDM14], respectively. These results hold over
ﬁelds of any characteristic, whereas our results only hold over ﬁelds of characteristic
diﬀerent from 2 and 3. It is very likely that also Corollary 6.5.3(iii) and (iv) hold
over ﬁelds of any characteristic.

6.6. Classiﬁcation theorem for structurable division algebras

Theorem 6.6.1. Let A be a central simple structurable division algebra over
a ﬁeld k of characteristic 6= 2, 3. Then A belongs to one of the classes (1)–(5)
described in section 2.3. Namely, A is isomorphic to one of the following:
(1) a central simple associative division algebra with involution;
(2) a central simple Jordan division algebra;
(3) a structurable algebra constructed from a non-degenerate anisotropic hermitian

form over a central simple associative division algebra with involution;

(4) a central simple structurable division algebra of skew-dimension 1;
(5) a structurable division algebra that is a form of a tensor product of two compo-

sition algebras.

Proof. By Theorem 4.3.1 the algebraic k-group G = Aut(K(A))◦ is an ad-
joint simple algebraic group of k-rank 1. In particular, the relative type of G is
either A1 or BC1.

If G has relative type A1, then the unipotent radicals of the parabolic subgroups

of G are abelian, and K(A)2σ = 0. Hence A is a Jordan division algebra.

Assume that G has type BC1. By the classiﬁcation of Tits indices [Tit66,
PS11] of simple algebraic groups, either G is of classical type, or its index is in

6.6. CLASSIFICATION THEOREM FOR STRUCTURABLE DIVISION ALGEBRAS

In the ﬁrst case, A is a structurable algebra constructed from a non-
Table 1.
degenerate anisotropic hermitian form over a central simple associative division
algebra with involution by Remark 6.3.2 and Corollary 1.4.5. In the second case,
we see from Table 1 that either dim(Z(U )) = 1, where U is the root group of the
corresponding Moufang set, or G is of type F 21

8,1. Since

by e.g. Theorem 5.1.6, the cases dim(Z(U )) = 1 are exactly the ones where A is a
structurable algebra of skew-dimension 1. In the remaining four cases, A is a form
of a tensor product of two composition algebras by Proposition 6.5.1.
