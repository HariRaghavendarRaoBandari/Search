Abstract. General aspects about the thermodynamics of astrophysical systems are discussed,
overall, those concerning to astrophysical systems in mutual interaction (or the called open astro-
physical systems). A special interest is devoted along the paper to clarify several misconceptions
that are still common in the recent literature, such as the direct application to the astrophys-
ical scenario of notions and theoretical frameworks that were originally conceived to deal with
extensive systems of the everyday practice (large systems with short-range interactions). This
discussion starts reviewing the current understanding about the notion of negative heat capac-
ity. Beyond to clarify its physical relevance, it is discussed the conciliation of this notion within
classical ﬂuctuation theory, as well as equilibrium conditions concerning to systems with negative
heat capacities. These results motivate a revision of our understanding about critical phenom-
ena, phase transitions and the called zeroth law of thermodynamics. Afterwards, general features
about the thermodynamics of astrophysical systems are presented throughout the consideration
of simple models available in the literature. A particular attention is devoted to the inﬂuence of
evaporation on the macroscopic behavior of these systems. These antecedents are then applied to
a critical approach towards the thermodynamics of astrophysical systems in mutual interaction. It
is discussed that the long-range character of gravitation leads to the incidence of long-range corre-
lations. This peculiarity imposes a series of important consequences, such as the non-separability
of a single astrophysical structure into independent subsystems, the breakdown of additivity and
conventional thermodynamic limit, a great sensibility of the macroscopic behavior to the external
conditions, the restricted applicability of the called thermal contact in astrophysics, and hence,
the non-relevance of conventional statistical ensembles in this scenario. To clarify how some of
conventional notions and theoretical frameworks could be extended to open astrophysical systems,
an exploratory study of a paradigmatic situation is presented: a binary astrophysical system. This
analysis is carried out in the framework of the quadrupole approximation, which represents the
lowest coupling among internal and collective degrees of freedom. Apparently, collective motions
are responsible of a non-linear energy interchange among the astrophysical systems. This mech-
anism introduces some modiﬁcations in equilibrium conditions for stationary and stability, such
as a generalization of Thirring’s stability condition for systems with negative heat capacities [Z.
Phys. 235, 339 (1970)]. Additionally, the stability of collective motions of this binary astro-
physical system is also discussed, which is related to the low energy thermodynamic behavior of
the model discussed by Votyakov and co-workers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 031101 (2002)]. The
thermodynamic limit for self-gravitating gas of identical non-relativistic point particles is then
derived and compared with other diﬀerent proposals. The astrophysical counterpart of Gibbs-
Duhem relation is obtained and compared with recent proposal of Latella and co-workers [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 114, 230601 (2015)]. Finally, it is analyzed the incidence of nonextensivity during
the merge of two identical astrophysical systems. On the contrary to the situation considered in
Gibbs paradox, the merge is an irreversible process that crucially depends on the existence (or
nonexistence) of the external gravitational inﬂuence of other systems.

1. Introduction

Astrophysical structures observed in the Universe, including the Universe itself, pose challenging
questions for the conventional thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Gravitation is a long-
range interaction that does not satisfy the stability and regularity properties [1, 2, 3, 4], which
are basic requirements for a self-consistent statistical mechanical description and the validity of
theorems assuring the equivalence of statistical ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. Considerable
eﬀorts have been devoted in the last decades for understanding thermo-statistical properties of long-
range interacting systems, in particular, the astrophysical systems [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

The motivation for this paper born from the reading of some recent contributions on the
thermo-statistics of gravitational clustering phenomenon in Cosmology [10, 11, 12, 13]. As expected,
thermodynamic description provides a diﬀerent view of this phenomenon beyond the standard
picture obtained from observations and N -body cosmological simulations. Many works available in
the literature start from the consideration of conventional ensembles of statistical mechanics such
as canonical or gran-canonical ensembles [10, 12]. These studies typically involve the calculation of
partition function:

(1)

ZN (T, V ) =

1

ΛN N !Z exp [−βHN (r, p)] dN rdN p

associated with a self-gravitating system of N non-relativistic particles with Hamiltonian HN (r, p).
Partition function depends on the system volume V and its average temperature T , which enters
into expression (1) via the control parameter β = 1/kT . The constant Λ normalizes the phase
space volume cell. This type of statistical description, however, is not fully justiﬁed according to
the present understanding about thermodynamics of astrophysical systems.

This work is devoted to discuss limitations of conventional thermo-statistical treatments in
their application to astrophysical situations, as well as the revision of some thermodynamic notions
concerning to systems in mutual interaction. The paper is organized into sections as follows.
The second section is devoted to review the current understanding of the negative heat capacity
phenomenon, which is a distinguishing macroscopic behavior in the thermodynamics of astrophysical
systems. A special attention is paid to the stability conditions and the ﬂuctuation theorems
compatible with systems with negative heat capacities. These thermo-statistical results enable us
to perform a re-examination of several important notions in statistical mechanics. The third section
is devoted to review some general thermodynamic features of astrophysical systems throughout the
consideration of simple models proposed in the literature. The main contributions of this work
are presented in fourth section. Special interest will be devoted to the revision of the notions
of separability and additivity, as well as their relevance in the thermodynamic stability conditions
that are applicable to astrophysical systems in mutual interaction. This analysis will be focussed on
the consideration of a binary astrophysical system, a simple but paradigmatic situation to clarify
the role of the called quadrupole-orbit coupling and the angular momentum conservation on the
stability of astrophysical systems in mutual interaction. The question about the non-extensivity of
astrophysical systems will be also addressed, as well as the possible relevance of a thermodynamic
limit for the case of self-gravitating gas of identical non-relativistic point particles. Finally, some
conclusions and open problems are summarized in the ﬁfth section.

2. Negative heat capacities: relevance, misconceptions and implications

2.1. Negative heat capacity: A conﬂicting thermodynamic notion

Gravitational clustering is a sudden process of re-organization that leads to development of
compact astrophysical structures with negative heat capacities. Although this thermodynamic
behavior is regarded as an anomaly from the conventional perspective of statistical mechanics
and thermodynamics, its presence is more a rule rather than an exception in the framework of
astrophysical systems. In fact, this behavior plays a fundamental role during their evolution. It
explains, as example, how interior of stars become hotter while shrink under its own gravitational
ﬁeld, a process that enables the occurrence of nuclear fusion reactions among more heavy atomic
nuclei along the stellar evolution. The ubiquitous character of negative heat capacities in
astrophysics can be justiﬁed through simple arguments as the virial theorem [14], or even more
elaborated astrophysical models such as Antonov isothermal model [15] and King models of star
clusters [16]. Nowadays, the existence of negative heat capacities has been reported in many
other physical scenarios [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] and its physical relevance is now widely accepted.
Nevertheless, there still survive several misconceptions and open questions concerning to this
notion. For example, there is a poorly knowledge in physical community about thermodynamical
equilibrium conditions associated with negative heat capacities and their unexpected implications
on conventional ideas of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.

2.2. Explanation of negative heat capacities paradox

Eddington was ones of the ﬁrst investigators to advertise that a star or a stars cluster expands
and cool down by absorbing energy [14]. His arguments were based on virial theorem of classical
mechanics [23]. Decades later [24], Lynden-Bell and Wood considered the concept of negative speciﬁc
heat to explain gravothermal catastrophe of isothermal model of Antonov [15]. While astronomers
enjoyed Eddington incongruous conclusions, the notion of negative speciﬁc heat (or negative heat
capacity) was received that time with skepticism by the statistical mechanics community [19, 25].
As already emphasized two years later by Thirring [26], the known theorem of classical ﬂuctuation
theory [27]:

C = kβ2(cid:10)δU 2(cid:11)

seems to suggest that heat capacity should be nonnegative. Thirring himself explained this paradox
through the inequivalence of canonical and microcanonical statistical ensembles. Fluctuation
relation (2) can be straightforwardly obtained by combining the ﬁrst derivatives of canonical
partition function (1):

(2)

hUi = −

∂
∂β

k log Z(β) and (cid:10)δU 2(cid:11) = −

∂2
∂β2 k log Z(β)

(3)

where β = 1/kT , with T being environmental temperature (the system is found in thermal
equilibrium with a heat bath or a thermostat), and k is Boltzmann constant. However, a diﬀerent
perspective is obtained when one starts from microcanonical deﬁnition of temperature:

1
T

∂U → −

Accordingly, a closed system exhibits a negative heat capacity when the entropy S is a convex
function on the energy. As extensively discussed by Gross [7], this mathematical behavior arises in

nonhomogeneous systems, such as the long-range interacting systems like the astrophysical ones,
or ﬁnite systems with short-range interactions that undergo a phase coexistence phenomenon, etc.
Thermodynamically speaking, the heat capacity is a response function. If the system macroscopic
state is determined by several control variables X besides energy, the second order derivatives
of entropy can be related to other response functions such as isothermal magnetic and electric
susceptibilities, the isothermal compressibility, etc. Consequently, the existence of negative values
in the heat capacity is just a particular case of anomalous values in response functions, whose
mathematical origin is also related to the existence of states where the entropy is a non-concave
function.

2.3. Thirring stability conditions for systems with negative heat capacities

A general misunderstanding concerning to states with negative heat capacities is that the presence
of this anomaly, by itself, implies thermodynamical instability of these states. Although it could
sound strange, thermodynamical stability of a given system is not an intrinsic property of the same
one, but it crucially depends on the external conditions that were imposed to. This simple idea
has profound and unexpected implications. Let us illustrate the same one for the particular case
of systems with negative heat capacities. Following the same arguments of Thirring [26], let us
consider the typical arrangement considered in statistical mechanics: a closed system composed
of two ﬁnite systems A and B, which are put in thermal contact among them and isolated of any
external inﬂuence. As usual, let us assume that the total energy UT and entropy ST of the closed
system are additive quantities, UT = UA + UA and S = SA + SB. Maximization of entropy ST at
constant energy UT demands the stationary condition:

∂SA
∂UA −
as well as the stability condition:

(6)

where CA and CB are heat capacities of these systems. Accordingly, systems A and B are found in
thermal equilibrium if they exhibit the same temperature and their heat capacities satisfy one of
the following stability conditions: (i) both systems exhibit positive heat capacities, or (ii) a system
exhibits a negative heat capacity, e.g.: CA < 0, and the other a positive heat capacity CB > 0 that
satisﬁes the following inequality [26]:

CB < |CA| .

According to the above result, a system with negative heat capacity is found in thermal
equilibrium with other system (a bath) that exhibits a ﬁnite positive heat capacity. Conversely,
thermal equilibrium is not possible if that system is put in thermal contact with a Gibbs thermostat
(a heat bath that exhibits an inﬁnite heat capacity). This type of equilibrium situation is
the one associated with canonical or gran-canonical ensembles, which are widely employed to
perform thermodynamical description of extensive systems of everyday applications. Precisely,
these systems are under the inﬂuence of natural environment, whose heat capacity is regarded
inﬁnity for most of practical purposes. However, canonical or gran-canonical ensembles are unable
to describes the existence of negative heat capacities. Since this anomaly is a relevant feature
In
of astrophysical systems, these ensembles cannot provide an adequate treatment for them.

Figure 1. Violation of zeroth law of thermodynamics. Two systems A and B can be in
equilibrium, by separate, with a third system C. However, this fact does not imply that the
systems A and B will remain in equilibrium when they are put in thermal contact. There exist
the following counterexample: the systems A and B have negative heat capacities CA < 0 and
CB < 0, and the third system C a positive heat capacity CC < min [|CA| , |CA|].

other words, thermo-statistical approaches of gravitational clustering that start from calculation of
canonical partition function (1) are inadequate because of their consideration unable the access to
fundamental information concerning to thermodynamics of astrophysical systems.

2.4. Violation of zeroth-law of thermodynamics

An unexpected consequence of the above analysis concerns to the called zeroth law of
thermodynamics [28]. This rule talks about transitivity of thermodynamic equilibrium:
if two
systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system then they are in thermal equilibrium
with each other. Although this law helps to deﬁne the experimental notion of temperature,
its validity is restricted to conventional short-range extensive systems of everyday applications
that exhibit nonnegative heat capacities (see scheme of ﬁgure 1). According to Thirring stability
conditions, two identical systems that were initially prepared in the same macroscopic state, cannot
remain in thermal equilibrium with each other if this state exhibits a negative heat capacity. This
violation of zeroth law of thermodynamics was recently discussed by Ram´ırez-Hern´andez et al.
[29]. Curiously, these authors cited Thirring’s paper [26], but they didn’t discuss the relevance of
inequality (7) on explanation of this violation.

2.5. Conciliating the notion of negative heat capacities within classical ﬂuctuation theory

Fluctuation relation (2) does not mean that the heat capacity is nonnegative. Its true meaning
is that only those states with nonnegative heat capacities are stable under the external conditions
associated with canonical ensemble. According to Thirring stability criterium (7), open systems
with negative heat capacities can be studied using a generalized statistical ensemble that involves
a thermal contact with a bath with ﬁnite positive heat capacity. This argument was considered by
Curilef and I to generalize canonical ﬂuctuation relation (2) as follows [30, 31]:

C = kβ2(cid:10)δU 2(cid:11) + C hδβδUi ,

(8)
which is now compatible with the existence of negative heat capacities C < 0. As usual, δx = x−hxi
denotes the thermal ﬂuctuation of a given quantity x with statistical expectation value hxi. The
presence of the term hδβδUi accounts for the feedback perturbation of the environmental (or the
heat bath) inverse temperature β as consequence of the energy interchange with the system.

Conventional ensembles of equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g.:, canonical or gran-canonical
ensembles) disregard this type of inﬂuence‡. Applying this ﬂuctuation relation to a system A
that is put in thermal contact with a system B (environment), one obtains:

CACB

CA + CB

= kβ2(cid:10)δU 2
A(cid:11) .

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

Stability condition (6) is now re-derived from positivity of right-hand side of equation (9). Relation
(9) drops to canonical ﬂuctuation relation (2) in the limit CB → +∞, as well as the microcanonical
result (cid:10)δU 2
A(cid:11) → 0 when CB → 0+. Accordingly, ﬂuctuation relation (8) is associated with a family
of generalized statistical ensembles that contains microcanonical and canonical ones as particular
cases. Notice that these generalized ensembles can be implemented in a physical laboratory with a
great accuracy.

Classical ﬂuctuation theory that is discussed in most of textbooks of equilibrium statistical
mechanics [1], is a formulation with a restricted applicability. Most of theorems such as the canonical
ﬂuctuation relation (2) between the heat capacity C and the energy U , and other known results as
the ﬂuctuation relation:

χT = β(cid:10)δM 2(cid:11)

between the isothermal magnetic susceptibility χT and the total magnetization M , provide a
wrong treatment to the existence of anomalous values in response functions. Derivation of
these theorems invokes approximations like Gaussian approximation, or alternatively, some special
system-surrounding equilibrium situations as the ones associated with canonical or gran canonical
ensembles, where the thermodynamic parameters of the surrounding (such its temperature T ,
pressure p, magnetic ﬁeld B, chemical potential µ, etc.) are regarded as unperturbed quantities
regardless the interaction with the system under consideration. However, a diﬀerent perspective
is revealed when one avoids the use of these arguments. For example, ﬂuctuation relation (9) was
pioneering derived by Challa and Hetherington in the framework of Montecarlo simulations based
on the Gaussian ensemble [36, 37]:

ωG (U ) =

1

Zλ (βs)

exph−βsU − λs (U − Us)2i

with parameter λs ≥ 0, which describes intermediate equilibrium situations between thermal
contact with a Gibbs thermostat (canonical ensemble) when λs → 0+ and energy isolation
(microcanonical ensemble) when λs → +∞. The form (8) is slightly more general, and yet, this
is just a particular case of more general ﬂuctuation theorems compatible with anomalous values
in response functions. As already shown by Curilef and I, these theorems appear as ﬁrst-order
approximations of the following exact ﬂuctuation theorem [32]:

(cid:10)δηiδX j(cid:11) = −kδi

i,

which represents a ﬂuctuation form of Le Chatelier-Brown principle [1]: Any change in status
quo prompts an opposing reaction in the responding system. Here, ηi = ∂S(X|θ)/∂X i are the

‡ Besides negative heat capacities, the notion of temperature ﬂuctuations is also conﬂictive. Feshbach, Kittel and
Mandelbrot protagonized in Physics Today a lively debated in turns to this concept in the past [33, 34, 35]. Kittel
argumented that a system exhibits a deﬁnite temperature when it is put in contact with a heat bath with inﬁnite
heat capacity. In other words, he regarded temperature as the control parameter β = 1/kT of canonical ensemble
p(Ui|β) = exp(−βUi)/Z(β). Consequently, Kittel claimed that the notion of temperature ﬂuctuations is an oxymoron.
Certainly, temperature parameter of canonical ensemble does not admit thermal ﬂuctuations,
in the same way
that this ensemble does not describe negative heat capacities. However, microcanonical deﬁnition of temperature
1/T = ∂S/∂U does not undergo these limitations.

generalized restituting forces derived from the entropy S(X|θ) of a closed system that appears in
Einstein postulate [1]:

dp(X|θ) = AeS(X|θ)/kdX.

Moreover, k is the Boltzmann constant and θ certain control parameters for this closed system.
Exact result (12) is a direct consequence of the divergence theorem, which is surprising that
the same one has not been derived before. Considering Cauchy-Schwartz inequality |hδAδBi|2 ≤
(cid:10)δA2(cid:11)(cid:10)δB2(cid:11), this exact theorem leads to the following uncertainty-like inequality:
with ∆x = phδx2i being the statistical uncertainty of a random quantity x. Formally, this is a

thermo-statistical analogous of Heisenberg uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics [38], whose
existence was postulated by Bohr in the early days of quantum mechanics [39]. By itself, this result
suggests an interesting analogy between statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics [38], and
therefore, an analogy between thermodynamics and classical mechanics.

2.6. Conventional understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena revisited

A direct consequence of the above exact results is that the external conditions modify the
thermodynamic stability and ﬂuctuating behavior of a given system. by itself, this simple conclusion
challenges the conventional understanding of phase transitions and critical phenomena [40]. For
example, the exact solution of 2D Ising model predicts a divergence of the heat capacity at the
critical point [1]. According to canonical ﬂuctuation relation (2), such a divergence implies the
divergence of thermal ﬂuctuations of energy. However, thermal ﬂuctuations of energy described by
equation (9) now depend on the presence of bath with ﬁnite heat capacity CB. This generalized
ﬂuctuation relation predicts that energy ﬂuctuations remain ﬁnite regardless the divergence of
system heat capacity CA → +∞. This means that divergence of thermal ﬂuctuations observed at
the critical point, and other critical phenomena (e.g.: spontaneous breaking of symmetry, critical
opalescence, long-range order, etc.), are not intrinsic properties for a given system because of their
occurrence also depends on the external conditions.

solid-liquid,

Most of phase transitions of conventional extensive systems (e.g.:

liquid-gas,
ferromagnetic-paramagnetic, etc.) are consequences of some type of thermodynamic instability
associated with the presence of anomalous values in response functions. A simple example is
shown in ﬁgure 2, speciﬁcally, the temperature-driven discontinuous phase transition of the ten-
state Potts model on the square lattice L × L with periodic boundary conditions. As clearly shown
in left panel of this ﬁgure, the branch of microcanonical caloric curve β(U ) = ∂S(U )/∂U with
negative heat capacities is non accessible within canonical ensemble. The presence of these states
forces the bimodal character of canonical energy distributions in the neighborhood of critical inverse
temperature βc as well as the existence of a latent heat qL for the transition from the ordered phase
towards the disordered one. These behaviors disappear once the heat bath of canonical ensemble
is replaced by a heat bath with ﬁnite heat capacity CB. Of course, the development of non-
homogeneities, such as phase separations in ﬂuids or formation of magnetic domains, will be also
observed in this case, but all those eﬀects associated with instability of negative heat capacities
within canonical ensemble will disappear, such as bimodality of energy distributions, large thermal
ﬂuctuations, long-range statistical correlations, etc. Phase coexistence has nothing to do with
the multimodal character of distributions. The formation of non-homogeneities actually occurs
when there exist a unique energy peak, as the case shown in right panel of ﬁgure 2. The inverse

occurrence of phase coexistence phenomenon of the ten-state Potts model on the square lattice
25 × 25 with periodic boundary conditions (u = U/N is the energy per site). This study
clearly illustrates bimodal character of energy distribution functions when the inverse temperature
parameter β of canonical ensemble takes values around the critical value βc ≃ 1.421 of temperature
driven discontinuous PT. Notice that the branch of microcanonical caloric curve β(u) = ∂s(u)/∂u
(open squares) with states with negative heat capacities C < 0 is poorly populated by using
a bath with constant temperature, since these states are canonically unstable. The values of
bath inverse temperature β are represented here by horizontal lines. Intersection points of these
horizontal lines with microcanonical inverse temperature correspond to the energies where energy
distribution function exhibits its local maxima and minima. Right panel: The use of a bath with
a ﬁnite heat capacity CB enables a direct study of the branch of microcanonical caloric curve
(open squares) with negative heat capacities. Here, energy distribution exhibits a single Gaussian-
peak that is located inside the region where microcanonical caloric curve exhibits negative heat
capacities C < 0. Both the bath inverse temperature βB (thick red line) and the system energy
U exhibit thermal ﬂuctuations around to their equilibrium values, which are described by the
energy-temperature ﬂuctuation relation (8).

temperature βB of the bath is not longer a good control variable for this type of situations, but
the proper internal energy U of the system. By adding a certain amount of energy to system-bath
arrangement, the bath inverse temperature βB is self-adjusted to reach a thermal equilibrium. The
mean values hβBi and hUi are now fully able to describe the S-bend dependence of microcanonical
curve of ﬁgure 2, while their ﬂuctuation behavior enables a determination of states with negative
heat capacities via ﬂuctuation relation (8). This procedure have been employed with great success
to design Monte Carlo methods much more eﬃcient than others proposed in the literature [41]. The
advantage is that several diﬃculties associated with occurrence of phase transitions can be avoided
with a ﬁne-tuning of external conditions.

The present ideas have important implications in understanding the thermodynamics of
astrophysical systems. As expected, the thermodynamic stability (or instability) of a given
astrophysical system is not an intrinsic property of the same one since it depends on the external
inﬂuence of other astrophysical systems. Surprisingly, such a dependence on the external conditions
is not restricted to its ﬂuctuating behavior and thermodynamic stability: every thermodynamic
behavior of the astrophysical system is considerably aﬀected by any external perturbation because
of the long-range character of gravitation. This peculiarity is one of the reasons that explains why
thermodynamics of astrophysical systems is so radically diﬀerent from that of extensive systems of
everyday practice.

3. Thermodynamics of astrophysical systems through some simple models

3.1. Eddington arguments using virial theorem

To my knowledge, the pioneering evidence about the relevance of negative heat capacities in
astrophysics was provided by Eddington [14]. He considered the virial theorem:

3pV = 2 hKi + nhWi

for a 3D system of non-relativistic point particles whose interacting forces exhibit a radial
dependence 1/rn+1. For open astrophysical systems n = 1 and its external pressure p = 0.
Therefore, the expectation values of the total kinetic and potential energies are related as hKi =
− hWi /2, while the total energy hUi = hKi + hWi = − hKi. Assuming the equipartition relation
between kinetic energy and temperature hKi = 3N kT /2, one obtains the following estimation for
heat capacity:

hUi = −3N kT /2 → C = dhUi /dT = −3N k/2 < 0.

Although the virial theorem (15) provides a simplest argument that the heat capacity of
astrophysical systems could be negative, the general applicability of this analysis cannot be over-
estimated. For example, the heat capacity can be positive when an astrophysical system is conﬁned
under an external potential well w(r). On the other hand, the equipartition relation hKi = 3N kT /2
does not hold if the astrophysical system suﬀers from the evaporation of its constituents. Let us
review some simple thermo-statistical astrophysical models that exemplify the present limitations
of Eddington analysis.

3.2. Antonov isothermal model

The simplest model that considers the presence of a potential well is the Antonov isothermal model
[15]. Speciﬁcally, this model considers a self-gravitating gas of identical non-relativistic classical
point particles:

if r ∈ Ω ⊂ R3
+∞ otherwise.

Gm2
|ri − rj|

Since this external ﬁeld exhibits an inﬁnite potential barrier, it fully suppresses the evaporation of
system constituents. Therefore, the equipartition relation hKi = 3N kT /2 holds as well as virial
theorem (15) with non-vanishing external pressure p. For energies suﬃciently large, the average
potential energy hWi can be neglected in comparison with the average total kinetic energy hKi, so
that, this system behaves in this limit as an ideal gas with positive heat capacity C = 3N k/2 that
ﬁlls uniformly the volume of container. For energies suﬃciently low, the absolute value of the total
gravitational potential and the kinetic energies become comparable, but the external pressure p falls
signiﬁcantly. Accordingly, one should observe conﬁgurations with negative heat capacities for low
energies. The simplest container geometry with boundary ∂Ω is the spherical shape with radius R,
whose microcanonical dependencies are shown in ﬁgure 3. It was introduced here the dimensionless
variables for energy u = U R/GM 2, temperature t = kT R/GM m and pressure σ = pR4/GM 2.

Figure 3. Main panel: Microcanonical temperature and pressure dependencies associated with
Antonov isothermal model with spherical container using dimensionless variables u = U R/GM 2,
t = kT R/GM m and σ = pR4/GM 2. The notable points of caloric curve uA = −0.355 and
uB = −0.197 correspond to critical points of gravothermal and isothermal collapses. The branch
uA < u < uB (red line) are conﬁgurations with negative heat capacities. The microcanonical
pressure exhibits a third notable point uC = −0.288 where the dimensionless pressure variable
σ over exhibits its minimal value σC = 0.027. Inset panel: energy dependence of the inverse of
the speciﬁc heat c = C/N k. Notice that the asymptotic limit c → 3/2 when u → +∞ (ideal gas
behavior), and its vanishing when u → u+
A.

Besides the qualitative behaviors previously commented, one observes the existence of three notable
energies: uA = −0.335, uB = −0.197 and uC = −0.288.
According to these dependencies, equilibrium conﬁgurations are possible for energies u > uA
only. Therefore, a system with energy u ≤ uA becomes unstable under its own gravitation ﬁeld and
undergoes a gravitational collapse. For energies near the critical energy uA, the system exhibits a
branch with negative heat capacities up to the point uB. Additionally, equilibrium conﬁgurations
are possible for temperatures t ≥ tA only, where tA = 0.397 is the temperature that corresponds to
the second notable energy uB. If the astrophysical system is put in thermal contact with an heat
bath of constant temperature T (canonical ensemble), the same one will undergo a gravitational
collapse if the bath temperature T < TB = tBGM m/Rk. This second instability process is
referred to as isothermal collapse, so that, the energy uA is the critical point of isothermal collapse.
Finally, equilibrium conﬁgurations are only possible for pressures σ ≥ σC , where σC = 0.027
is the pressure that corresponds to the third notable energy uC.
If the radius R of container
is allowed to change and the system is surrounded by an environment with constant pressure
p (isobaric ensemble), the system will undergo a gravitational collapse when the environmental
pressure p < pC = σC GM 2/R4. As expected, this third gravitational instability could be referred
to as an isobaric collapse. The practical realization of isothermal and isobaric collapses are quite

unrealistic in the astrophysical scenario. As already discussed, thermal contact associated with
canonical ensemble involves short-range interactions, but astrophysical systems interact among
them through gravitation, which is a long-range force. Although the presence of a container is a
simplifying assumption to study astrophysical systems, it is clearly nonphysical for real situations.
The only gravitational instability that plays a relevant role in real applications is the gravothermal
collapse. This process drives the formation of astrophysical structures in every scale, ranging from
the formation of planetesimals up to the large-scale galaxies distribution in the Universe.

3.3. Incidence of evaporation: King model

The incidence of evaporation represents an unavoidable process in the framework of real
astrophysical systems. A simple model that accounts for the incidence of evaporation was proposed
by King [16], which provides a suitable description about structure and evolution of star clusters
in astrophysics. Its key assumption is the relevance of quasi-stationary one-body distribution:

fqs(r, p|β, εc) = Aneβ[εc−ε(r,p)] − 1o Θ [εc − ε (r, p)] ,

(19)

which was introduced by Michie [42]. Formally, this is deformed Maxwell-Boltzmann proﬁle that
is truncated at the escape energy εc. Here, ε (r, p) = p2/2m + mϕ(r) is the mechanical energy of
individual stars, while Θ(x) is the Heaviside step function. The energy parameter εc < 0 represents
the energy threshold of stars to escape from the gravitational ﬁeld of globular cluster and fall into
gravitational inﬂuence of a nearby galaxy.

The one-body distribution (19) leads to the following particles density n(r):

n(r) =Z fqs(r, p|β, εc)

Finally, Φ = β [εc − mϕ(r)] denotes the dimensionless potential. For an spherical symmetric
distribution, expression (20) predicts the vanishing of stars distribution n(r) outside the region:

with Rt being the tidal radius [3]. Here, M is the total mass of the system, while m is the mass
of its constituting stars. The tidal radius Rt appears as an independent parameter of King model,
but it can be estimated by analyzing the gravitational ﬁeld of the nearby galaxy. For example,
the estimation of equation (73) is derived in the framework of quadrupole approximation (48) by
assuming that a globular cluster of mass MA moves along a circular orbit of average distance D
around a galaxy of mass MB.

According to dependencies shown in left panel of ﬁgure 4, King model satisﬁes the virial ratio
ρ = −2 hKi / hWi ≡ 1, which implies a decreasing of kinetic energy when the total energy U is
increased. However, the mean value of total kinetic energy hKi does not follow a linear relation
with the quantity T = 1/kβ, which could be regarded as the temperature parameter of quasi-
stationary one-body distribution (19). Once again, one observes a branch of caloric curve with
negative heat capacities C < 0 between the point of gravothermal collapse uA ≃ −2.134 and the
point of isothermal collapse uB = −0.898. A new feature is the upper bound for the total energy at
uC = −0.601, which corresponds to the point of evaporation disruption. Accordingly, a macroscopic
conﬁguration with energy u ≥ uC is unstable under evaporation. Such an astrophysical system will
undergo a sudden evaporation in order to release its excess of energy and gain stability.
It is
remarkable that the energy of gravothermal collapse uA predicted by King model is appreciably
lower than the one corresponding to Antonov isothermal model. This behavior is related to the
vanishing of particles distributions at the tidal radius Rt. It is shown in right panel of ﬁgure 4 that
proﬁles with more diluted haloes also exhibit more dense cores. Consequently, the absolute values
of the total potential energy and its associated kinetic energies and temperatures are greater than
the ones corresponding to the isothermal model. Several aspects of thermodynamics of King models
and related questions have been recently analyzed in the literature by other authors. Interested
readers can see references [43, 44] for further details.

3.4. Generalization: Truncated γ-exponential models

Besides King model, the incidence of evaporation is also considered by other simple models, such
as the truncated isothermal model of Wooley and Dickens [45], and Wilson model [46]. Quasi-
stationary one-body distributions of all these models can be expressed into a unifying form as
follows:

fqs(r, p|β, εc) = AEt(x),

where x = β [εc − ε(r, p)], and Et(x) is a certain truncated exponential function Et(x) that vanishes

of these distributions for diﬀerent values of deformation parameter γ are shown in left panel of
ﬁgure 5. This family of phenomenological models provides us a more complete picture about the
incidence of evaporation on the thermodynamics of astrophysical systems. It contains Wooley and
Dicken model for γ = 0, King model for γ = 1, Wilson model for γ = 2, while Plummer model [50]
seems to be a singular asymptotic case when γ → 7/2 and εc → 0−.

Notice that the divergence of |uA| and n0A at the notable value γc ≃ 2.13, and the divergence of

Therefore, particles distribution (27) uniﬁes the known isothermal and polytropic proﬁles with
n = γ + 3/2. The deformation parameter γ determines the polytropic structure of the haloes, being
this feature a consequence of evaporation. Some of these proﬁles are shown in right panel of ﬁgure
5, which has been ﬁtted using an isothermal proﬁle for the core and a polytropic proﬁle for the halo.
Since the deformation parameter γ is nonnegative and the polytropic proﬁles are unstable for n ≥ 5
[49], the admissible values of the polytropic exponent n are restricted to the interval 3/2 ≤ n < 5,
which correspond to the interval 0 ≤ γ < 7/2 for the deformation parameter γ. Distribution proﬁles

is remarkable that the existence of a notable value of deformation parameter γc ≃ 2.13, where one
observes the divergence of energy and density corresponding to the gravothermal collapse, uA = +∞
and n0A = +∞ when γc ≤ γ < 7/2. Since the system needs to release an inﬁnitely amount of energy
to reach this ground state, the dramatic character of gravothermal collapse has been considerably
reduced in comparison to the cases 0 ≤ γ < γc. The explanation of this behavior can be understood
by analyzing the ﬁgure 7, which represents the phase diagram in the plane of integration parameters
γ − Φ0 of diﬀerential equation (29). The central values of dimensionless potential Φ0 provides a
measure about the isothermal character of the core. According to asymptotic behavior (28), larger
values of this parameter guarantee the existence of isothermal cores, whose maximum value ΦA
corresponds to the point of gravothermal collapse. The same one exhibits a very weak dependence
on the deformation parameter γ for the cases 0 ≤ γ < γc, and suddenly, it starts to decreases for
the cases γc ≤ γ < 7/2. The inner regions of distribution proﬁles with γc ≤ γ < 7/2 are so cuspid
that they cannot be adjusted with the isothermal proﬁle. Isothermal cores are only possible for low
energies and values of deformation parameter γ below the notable value γc, 0 ≤ γ < γc. Finally,
one can observe a progressive divergence of dimensionless energy |u| and central density of the other
notable points when γ → 7/2, which is directly related to the instability of polytropic proﬁles with
n ≥ 5.

with M = N m. Although this distribution is inﬁnitely extended in the space, it exhibits a ﬁnite
total mass M due to the fast power-law decreasing 1/r5 when r → +∞. Originally, this model was
introduced by Plummer [50] to ﬁt distribution proﬁles of star clusters, but nowadays is employed in
N -body simulations as a toy model to assign initial conditions [51]. This model can be associated
with the following quasi-stationary one-body distribution:

fP (r, p|β) = A [−βε(r, p)]7/2 .

This distribution seems to be an asymptotic case of truncated γ-exponential model (24) with
γ → 7/2− and threshold energy εs → 0− (or tidal radius Rt → +∞). Calculating the relation

This model satisﬁes virial theorem (15) with vanishing external pressure p = 0. Therefore, it
describes an open astrophysical system with no external gravitational inﬂuence. All its properties
are determined by its internal energy U and number of particles N . Notice that this model does
not describe the occurrence the gravitational collapse and the evaporation disruption.

3.6. Quasi-ergodic model

Among the astrophysical models reviewed here, Antonov isothermal model is the only based on
equilibrium statistical mechanics. The other models represent phenomenological attempts to include
evaporation eﬀects. Even the expression (19) was a suitable approximation introduced by Michie
[42]. Let us ﬁnally review a simple astrophysical model that also includes evaporation eﬀects,
but this time from a purely statistical mechanics perspective: the quasi-ergodic model [52].
Its
introduction invokes the existence of a certain quasi-ergodicity of microscopic dynamics, that is,
the system evolution is able to perform a uniform exploration in a ﬁnite subset of the N -body phase
space composed on all those microscopic conﬁgurations where particles are trapped by the system
gravitational ﬁeld.

The previous hypothesis relies on dynamical foundations. Besides collisions, there is another
general relaxation mechanism that explains a strong chaoticity of N -body nonlinear Hamiltonian
dynamics, and hence, the possible justiﬁcation of its ergodicity and mixing [53]. As already
shown by Pettini and co-workers in the framework of geometrical description of Hamiltonian
chaos [54, 55], systems with bounded motions in the conﬁgurational space can undergo the
mechanism of parametric resonance. Numerical studies in the framework of astrophysical systems

have revealed that these systems exhibit strong chaotic properties even when collision events are
practically nonexistent [56], which supports application of conventional statistical arguments even
for collisionless stellar systems such as elliptical galaxies [57]. An isolated astrophysical system is
not able to satisfy ergodicity because of the accessible N -body phase space is unbound. Ergodicity
is restored if the system is somehow forced to remain trapped inside a ﬁnite region of the N -
body phase space. This requirement is achieved when the system is enclosed by a container with
impenetrable walls, which provides here a spacial regularization for the statistical description (thus
avoiding the known long-range divergence of gravitation). Licitness of Antonov isothermal model
relies on this argument. Alternatively, an eﬀective conﬁnement is also achieved by the incidence
evaporation in presence of an external gravitational ﬁeld, which introduces the restriction:

ε(r, p) = p2/2m + mϕ(r) < εc < 0.

(38)

This constraint introduces as a sort of energetic regularization for the statistical description, where
ergodicity is partially restored in a form of quasi-ergodicity. This means that the system will evolve
along a certain quasi-stationary regime under these conditions, where its total energy and number
of particles behave as quasi-conserved quantities.

Statistical description starts from the calculation of the number of microscopic conﬁgurations:

ﬁeld wc(r) of the external forces now extracts all those particles whose individual mechanical energy
ε(r, p) overcomes the threshold energy εc. For the sake of simplicity, the mathematical form of this
external ﬁeld is idealized as follows:

wc(r) =(cid:26) 0

if |r| < Rt
−∞ otherwise,

where Rt = −GM m/εc is the tidal radius. Formally, this external ﬁeld mimics a container with
a perfect absorbing walls: every particle that reaches the boundary of this region is immediately
extracted out the system. Integral (39) can be estimated considering the continuum approximation
and the steepest descend method. In general, the quasi-ergodic model is able to access the same
qualitative features derived from truncated γ-exponential models, such as distributions proﬁles
with isothermal cores and polytropic haloes; states with negative heat capacities, and the existence
of collective behaviors such as gravitational collapse and evaporation disruption. A comparison
between caloric curves of Antonov isothermal model and quasi-ergodic model is shown in ﬁgure 8.
A distinguishing feature of this model is the presence of driving function C(r) in the distribution
proﬁle of this model:

with Φ(r) = β [εc − mϕ(r)] being the dimensionless potential. All previous models include the
incidence of evaporation as a power-law truncation of Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution at the threshold
energy. However, the present thermo-statistical arguments describe an additional and nontrivial
consequence of evaporation: a nonuniform redistribution of particles that arises as a long-range
eﬀect of gravitation.

4. Astrophysical systems in thermodynamic interaction

4.1. Non-extensive character and long-range correlations

The incidence of surface eﬀects in the framework of extensive systems can be neglected in
comparison with bulk eﬀects whenever the system size (e.g.: the number of particles N or the volume
V ) is very large. For example, the boiling temperature of water can depend on the environmental
pressure p, but it does not depend on the volume of container or its shape whenever one considers
the thermodynamic limit:

N → ∞ : where U/N and V /N are kept constant.

(43)

In contrast, the microcanonical caloric curves shown in ﬁgures 3 and 4 actually depend on the
radius R of container or the tidal radius Rt. It is possible to verify that thermodynamical behavior
of Antonov isothermal model depends both on the container shape and its linear dimensions [75].
Moreover, King model and its generalization, the truncated γ-exponential model, illustrate that the
incidence of evaporation produces a considerable aﬀectation in thermodynamics of astrophysical
systems, and in extreme cases, it is able to suppress the occurrence of gravitational collapse as the
situation described by Plummer model.

This remarkable behavior is associated with the long-range character of gravitational
interaction. Any external inﬂuence, even acting on the boundary or a small portion of the system,

CONTENTS

20

will aﬀect the system as a whole.
In the framework of extensive systems, such a sensibility to
the external inﬂuence is observed during the occurrence of a critical phenomenon because of the
divergence of correlation length ξ [1]. Roughly speaking, systems with long-range interactions,
as the astrophysical ones, behave as they permanently were in a critical state, although with a
less dramatic character. For example, the statistical correlations among particles in conventional
extensive systems follow an exponential behavior as C(ri, rj) ∝ exp [− |ri − rj| /ξ], where the
correlation length ξ is comparable to the system linear size near critical point [58]. For the case
of astrophysical systems, the two-point correlations are replaced by a power-law dependence as
C(ri, rj) ∝ 1/ |ri − rj|α, although one should observe a stronger dependence during the occurrence
of gravitational collapse. Some studies in the past revealed that the large-scale distribution of
galaxies in the universe seems to follow this type of power-law with exponent α ≃ 1.81 [76], and
presumably, other more complex behaviors are relevant in diﬀerent length scales [77].
The ubiquitous existence of long-range correlations in astrophysical situations is a direct
consequence of the long-range character of gravitation. Of course, some macroscopic behaviors
can be related to the fact that Newtonian gravitation w(r, r′) = −Gmm′/ |r − r′| is intrinsically
scale-free interaction. A purely classical self-gravitating gas of non-relativistic point particles
interacting via Newtonian gravitation, as the one described by Hamiltonian (17) with external
potential wc(r) = 0, has no characteristic energy or linear dimension. In fact, the characteristic
lengths and energies for most of astrophysical models reviewed in this work are determined by the
external conditions. A remarkable exception here is the Plummer model, where the characteristic
linear dimension of particles distribution (37) is determined from its own total energy U and mass
M . This astrophysical model exhibits what it could be regarded as a scale-free thermodynamic
behavior. The absence of characteristic lengths is the reason why this model cannot describe
collective behaviors like gravitational collapse or evaporation disruption.

4.2. Objections against Lynden-Bell and Wood explanation of gravothermal catastrophe:
non-applicability of conventional notions of separability and additivity in astrophysics

Lynden-Bell and Wood [24] employed the notion of negative heat capacity to explain gravothermal
collapse of Antonov isothermal model [15]. Their arguments were based on the application of
stability condition (7) considering the positive heat capacity of outer regions of the system and
the negative heat capacity of its inner ones§. Although their reasonings were quite convincing, a
re-examination of this situation clariﬁes that this stability criterion cannot be naively applied here.
The derivation of Thirring inequality (7) involves two strong conditions: (i) the separability of a
closed system into two independent subsystems, and (ii) the additivity of the total energy due to
the existence of a thermal contact. None of these conditions is met for the astrophysical situation
considered by these authors.

A single astrophysical structure (e.g.: a star or a stars cluster) cannot trivially divided into
subsystems in a way that its total entropy could be expressed as sum of respective entropies of these
subsystems. Gravitation is a long-range force, and hence, the constituents a given astrophysical

§ Although Thirring derived the stability criterium (7) two years after publication Lynden-Bell and Wood, these
last authors were aware about its existence. According to their own words: ... if the outer parts have a speciﬁc heat
smaller than the magnitude of the negative speciﬁc heat of the inner parts, then the outer temperature will increase
faster than the inner one. It will therefore catch up and a possible equilibrium state will be achieved. If however the
outer parts are too extensive their speciﬁc heat will be large. Conductive transfer of heat from the central parts will
then raise the high central temperature faster than it raises the lower temperature of the outer parts. This is what
we call the gravothermal catastrophe ...

21

structure are strongly correlated among them.
In fact, it is impossible to modify a part of the
same one without aﬀecting the whole astrophysical structure. This very fact is evidenced in
each astrophysical model previously considered, including the proper Antonov isothermal model.
However, the additivity of the total entropy arises as a good approximation when a closed system
is already divided into a very small number of astrophysical structures., e.g.: a binary star system,
a star cluster and its host galaxy, etc. Such an eﬀective separability is implemented in terms of
internal and collective degrees of freedom.

The separability of a given closed system into subsystems is a pre-requisite for the existence
of additivity for a given physical quantity. However, the separability itself does not guarantee the
additivity. The additivity of the energy under the thermal contact represents a good approximation
in the framework of large extensive systems of everyday applications since they are driven by
short-range interactions. The constituents of each system that are aﬀected by the presence of the
other one are mostly located near their surfaces, so that, the total interaction energy associated to
thermal contact can be regarded as a surface eﬀect, which is negligible in comparison to the bulk
internal energies of each system. In contrast, the interaction among astrophysical systems involve
all their constituting particles because of gravitation is a long-range interaction. The associated
interaction energy among astrophysical systems represent bulk eﬀects, so that, the additivity of
the total energy does not hold in generalk. A better understanding about how separability and
additivity are extended to astrophysical situations will be analyzed in the subsection 4.6.
To avoid any misunderstanding of potential readers, it is important to remark that gravitational
collapse is a type of thermodynamic instability that is present for most of astrophysical systems
in any scale. What is wrong here is the explanation of this phenomenon in terms of separability
of a given astrophysical system into independent subsystems. Gravitational collapse is related to
presence of negative heat capacities since both behaviors arise as direct consequences of radial
dependence −1/r of gravitational interaction (the called short-range divergence). However, one can
advertise an additional relationship analyzing the energy dependence of speciﬁc heat c = C/N k
shown in inset panel of ﬁgure 3. The critical energy of gravitational collapse uA also coincides with
the eventual vanishing of the heat capacity. Once again, this mathematical behavior may suggests
a misleading impression that heat capacity becomes zero as if the system would be decomposed
of separable outer and inner parts with the appropriate heat capacity. However, this behavior
is more analogue to the vanishing of heat capacity of quantum gases in the zeroth temperature
limit, where their internal degrees of freedom (e.g.: translational, vibrational and rotational) are
eﬀectively frozen. The astrophysical case is diﬀerent since the temperature grows when the system
approaches the point of gravitational collapse. The system as a whole undergoes at this critical
point a collective fall under its own gravitational ﬁeld, which leads to a sudden formation of a
core-halo structure and the transformation of potential energy into kinetic. This collective process
of self-organization is necessarily accompanied with a growth of the statistical correlations among
the particles. The number degrees of freedom is eﬀectively reduced here because of they lose their
statistical independence, which would explain the sudden reduction of heat capacity per particles.
From a thermo-statistical viewpoint, the gravitational collapse can be related to a new type of
collective phenomena: the called discontinuous microcanonical phase transitions [78]. This phase
transition involves an exotic type of ergodicity breaking [1], where the system is dynamically trapped
in one among two or more diﬀerent stable conﬁgurations that exhibit the same value of energy
(stable conﬁgurations with diﬀerent internal conditions for temperature, central density, pressure,

k The additivity of energy is trivially restored when these astrophysical structures are displaced far away from each
other. Since their mutual interactions become negligible, each system is put into energetic isolation.

22

etc.). Antonov isothermal model does not show this type of phase transitions since it disregards the
underlying physics in the post-collapse phase. As already discussed in the literature [43, 79, 80], the
system can ﬁnd a new branch of stable conﬁgurations after gravothermal collapse if the quantum
behavior of particles is taken into account, or even, when the particles exhibit an internal structure
like a small hard-core or soft-core radius.

4.3. Open astrophysical systems

Thermo-statistics of astrophysical systems is hallmarked by the occurrence of gravitational collapse
at low energies and the existence of states with negative heat capacities. Among conventional
ensembles of equilibrium statistical mechanics, the microcanonical ensemble is the only able to
describe these macroscopic behaviors. This statistical ensemble, however, presupposes that the
system of interest is put into energetic isolation, which is a situation that does not correspond to
actual conditions of astrophysical systems in Nature. Most of real astrophysical systems belong
to the class of open systems, that is, systems that are able to interchange energy and matter with
other astrophysical systems (e.g.: stars are part of multiple stars systems; stars clusters are under
gravitational inﬂuence of their host galaxy; galaxies themselves undergo the gravitational inﬂuence
of other galaxies in a galactic cluster, etc.).

Usually, open systems in equilibrium are described within canonical or gran canonical
ensembles. Although these statistical ensembles are employed in the literature to analyze
astrophysical problems, their consideration is merely a theoretical exercise without practical
support. How does one justify the existence of a thermal contact between an astrophysical system
and a Gibbs thermostat? Besides, what physical system meets the necessary requirements to be
considered as a good approximation of a Gibbs thermostat in the astrophysical scenario? From a
purely theoretical perspective, one can enclose the system inside a container whose walls are kept
at constant temperature [15], or immerse the astrophysical system into an inﬁnite medium with
constant temperature [59], among others. However, all these arguments are based on our practical
experience with short-range extensive systems, which is irrelevant to deal with astrophysical
problems. Astrophysical systems in Nature interact with other astrophysical systems only, which are
necessarily coupled among them throughout gravitation. Clearly, these situations do not correspond
to the ones considered by conventional statistical ensembles. The challenge here is the derivation
of more suitable statistical ensembles, as example, astrophysical counterparts of canonical and gran
canonical ensembles.

Why is this subject so important? As already emphasized in section 2, the thermodynamic
behavior of a given macroscopic system actually depends on the external conditions that were
impose to. This situation is known in the literature as inequivalence of ensembles [60, 61]. However,
the importance of this phenomenon in astrophysical problems is more signiﬁcant. The long-range
character of gravitation enables that any change in the external conditions will modify the system
bulk properties, such as the equations of state, the response functions, and even, the occurrence of
phase transitions. Accordingly, a realistic description of each open astrophysical system requires a
full speciﬁcation of its associated external conditions.

4.4. Other paradox concerning to negative heat capacities

The possible generalization of conventional statistical ensembles for astrophysical scenario requires
to face the following question: Can two or more astrophysical systems in mutual interaction, each
one with a negative heat capacity, remain in equilibrium (or at least, in a quasi-stationary situation)?

CONTENTS

23

According to Thirring stability conditions (see in subsection 7), two systems with negative heat
capacities cannot remain in equilibrium. However, a negative answer to the previous question could
be in contradiction with astrophysical observations. Most of stars in Universe are part of multiple
star systems, binary stars as example [62]. Strictly speaking, stars are thermodynamic systems with
negative heat capacities that are fully able to interchange energy by mean of their gravitational
interaction, as example, they undergo heating by tidal interactions [63]. If one star gains energy
from its companion in a binary system, its temperature decreases while the companion temperature
increases, a situation that in some way should speed-up the rate of energy transference. Such a
process will unavoidably lead to the gravitational collapse of the star that looses energy and the
evaporative disruption of its companion. In principle, this picture could be a regarded as a licit
description of ﬁnal stage of evolution of these systems, but binary stars should remain stable the
major part of their life. Notice that the stability analysis of these systems concerns both the
dynamic stability and the processes of mass transference [64, 65].

Typically,

it is regarded that these stellar systems evolve as independent thermodynamic
systems, which is obviously a simplifying consideration. This situation could be explained by two
reasons: (i) the rate of energy transference between the stars in a binary system is extremely low,
or (ii) there is something wrong with application of Thirring stability conditions in astrophysical
situations. This paradox situation is partially solved from the fact that the starting considerations
of Thirring stability criteria (7) do not apply for the case of astrophysical systems. Two separable
astrophysical systems in mutual interaction could support an additive total entropy, ST ≃ SA + SB.
However, their total energy UT cannot be expressed as the sum of their respective internal energies
as UT 6= UA + UB because of the long-range character of gravitation. I think that thermodynamic
stability could be possible under certain conditions, but it is necessary to perform a re-examination
of Thirring stability analysis for astrophysical situations.

4.5. Thermodynamic equilibrium or quasi-equilibrium?

Before to enter to analyze the conditions of thermodynamic stability, let us discuss about the
relevance of thermodynamic equilibrium for real astrophysical systems. As discussed elsewhere, this
is a suitable idealization that is assumed to face the study of conventional systems of everyday
applications of thermodynamics. Its existence is postulated in order to introduce the temperature
notion, which is keystone that supports other notions, methods and laws of thermodynamics.
Conceptually, the existence of thermodynamic equilibrium plays a similar role of the law of inertia
in classical mechanics. The later one is employed as a pre-requisite to introduce the notion of force
as a quantitative measure of interactions, while temperature diﬀerences (or gradients) behave as
generalized thermodynamic forces that drive the ﬂuxes of energy and heat among the macroscopic
systems. In an analogous way that a real system cannot fully be isolated from the incidence of
external forces, the systems in Nature cannot be found in a rigorous thermodynamic equilibrium.
At most, they exhibit a quasi-stationary evolution under certain background conditions, where
the rate of change of their macroscopic observables is suﬃciently slow during the lapse time of
interest. For practical purposes, such a very slow evolution of macroscopic behavior is suﬃcient
to speak about a sort of quasi-equilibrium. Our practical experience evidences that methods of
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics can be applied to predict the macroscopic properties of
systems in quasi-stationary conditions.

At ﬁrst glance, the study of real astrophysical systems present serious diﬃculties. Not only
their thermodynamic properties are diﬀerent, but the external background conditions that operate

CONTENTS

24

in a given astrophysical situation are non-controllable. This very fact contrasts with the case of
conventional extensive systems that are studied in our laboratories. The usage of idealizations such
as containers with impenetrable walls or non-conducting boundaries is highly nonphysical in the
astrophysical scenario. Consequently, the incidence of evaporation and the energy dissipation will
always play a signiﬁcant role here. Does this mean that we should renounce the use of all these
thermodynamic idealizations in the case of astrophysical systems? On the contrary, concepts and
methods of thermodynamics should be adapted to this physical scenario. In particular, the notion
of thermodynamic equilibrium should be replaced by a quasi-equilibrium, which is also relevant to
study traditional systems of everyday practice.

Is the notion of quasi-equilibrium relevant for real astrophysical systems? Judge yourself.
Stars are open astrophysical systems that continuously release energy and matter to the space.
However, they reach a quasi-stationary evolution with predictable regularities. The best example
of these regularities is the temperature-luminosity (or color-magnitude) relation represented by the
known Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams [67], as the one shown ﬁgure 9. Moreover, the eﬀective surface
temperature of stars and the spectrum of solar radiation can also described with a good accuracy
by the laws of black-body thermal radiation. Other example is the case of globular clusters, whose
distribution proﬁles and evolution can be explained with the help of simple statistical models, like
King models reviewed in this work [16]. Galaxies them-selves suﬀer from gravitational interaction
of other galaxies, and they presupposed evolve without the incidence of collisions. Surprisingly,
the brightness proﬁles of galaxies exhibit simple regularities such as Vaucouleurs and Sersic proﬁles
[68, 69], while their associated dark matter haloes also follow other predictable regularities [70].
Finally, the cosmic microwave background radiation also follows the law of blackbody thermal
radiation regardless the Universe itself is not in thermodynamic equilibrium [71, 72], but it
undergoes an accelerate expansion.

The existence of the above regularities is explained by the incidence of relaxation mechanisms
that lead all these astrophysical situations to quasi-stationary conditions. Of course, a Maxwellian
velocity distribution does not apply for a real astrophysical system. However, its applicability also
fails when quantum properties of matter turn relevant. In principle, the incidence of evaporation
should be seem as another modifying factor for this distribution. Evaporation is just a relaxation
mechanism in this context. For the case of stars clusters, those stars with suﬃcient energy to
escape will be removed by the incidence of external tidal forces of a nearby galaxy, so that,
the remaining stars will be more bound among them, which restrains further escapes.
Inverse
temperature parameter β = 1/kT of Maxwell distribution represents the scaling parameter of
velocities, which is the same role of parameter β in lower-isothermal Michie-King distribution (19)
or distribution proﬁle (41) of quasi-ergodic model. The notion of temperature is not associated with
a distribution with concrete mathematical form. It is the quantity that characterizes the energy
interchange among macroscopic systems in thermodynamic equilibrium. In principle, an eﬀective
temperature could be introduced to characterize quasi-stationary situations. Although quasi-
stationary proﬁle (41) of quasi-ergodic model is non-Maxwellian, its associated inverse temperature
parameter β = 1/kT is obtained from the microcanonical relation (4), which also enters in a sort of
Legrendre transformation between thermodynamic potentials (see in Ref. [52] for further details).
Anyway, the realistic possibility that an astrophysical situation is found in a quasi-stationary
regime (or quasi-equilibrium) requires the reconsideration of some deﬁnitions and terms. Let us
hereinafter refer by thermodynamic stability in conditions of quasi-equilibrium to the persistence or
the tendency of a system to remain its evolution along this quasi-stationary regime. On the contrary
case, one can speak about thermodynamic instability. It is expected that a system in conditions of

Figure 10. Two separable astrophysical systems A and B are coupled throughout its collective
degrees of freedom [R, P], which behaves here as a third system C (one-body system). The
quadrupole-orbit coupling in (48) is responsible of a tidal deformation of these systems, as well
as the existence of ﬁnite energy threshold εc for the escape of particles of each system from the
inﬂuence of its own gravitational ﬁeld and be trapped by the one of the other system. In principle,
the heat transference between these systems could be addressed considering a sort of Langevin
equation that describes the dynamics of low dimensional system C under the inﬂuence of two heat
baths with ﬁnite negative heat capacities. It is noteworthy that this situation is the basis for the
plausible introduction of astrophysical counterparts of the known canonical and gran canonical
statistical ensembles considering the limit MA ≪ MB. Such a picture could be relevant for
describing the thermodynamic interaction among a gralaxy and its stars clusters in astrophysics.

thermodynamic instability experiences a much faster evolution, if possible, towards a new regime
of quasi-stationarity. Everywhere in this work, when one refers to thermodynamic equilibrium or
stability for astrophysical situations, it should be implicitly understood that they refer to systems
in conditions of quasi-stationarity.

A particular illustration about the occurrence of this type of processes in Nature is the proper
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shown in ﬁgure 9, which reveals the diﬀerent stages of stellar evolution
[73]. Most of stars, including our Sun, are evolving along the called main-sequence the major part
of their life, where the energy is supplied by the fusion of hydrogen atoms at the star core. With the
eventual preponderance of helium atoms in that region, stars like the Sun begin to fuse hydrogen
along a layer surrounding the core. This process causes a gradual growth of the star size, which
abandons thus the main-sequence and passing through the subgiant stage until it reaches the red
giant phase. Once a star like the Sun has exhausted its nuclear fuel, the same one will experience
a fast gravitational collapse. Along the occurrence of this process, the star core becomes a dense
white dwarf and the outer regions are expelled as a planetary nebula. Stars with larger masses
can explode in a supernova, while their cores collapse to form an extremely dense neutron star,
or even, a black hole. The total mass is the most important quantity in the stellar stability and
evolution. However, this process also depends on other factors such as the chemical composition,
as well as whether or not they are under the external inﬂuence of neighboring systems. Most of
stars in Universe are part of multiple star systems. The evolution of a star in a binary system, as
example, could be aﬀected by the separation distance, the total mass and the stage of evolution of
its companion. Even, the occurrence of close encounters among stars could play an important role
in certain situations [74].

4.6. Thermal equilibrium conditions revisited

Let us consider two astrophysical systems A and B in mutual gravitational interaction. This
situation can be described in terms of their respective internal and collective degrees of freedom. For
each system, the internal degrees of freedom are the positions and their conjugated momenta {ri, pi}
relative to the center of mass, while the collective degrees of freedom (R, P) refer to the relative
separation vector of the centers of mass and its conjugated momentum, respectively. Denoting by
HA and HB the contributions of internal degrees of freedom, the Hamiltonian H of this closed

CONTENTS

system can be expressed as follows:

H = HA + HB + WAB,

27

(44)

where Hα with subindex α = (A, B) denotes the contribution of internal degrees of freedom of each
system:

Hα =Xiα

while the term WAB:

(48)

(49)

is the interaction energy that involves the contribution of collective motions and its couplings with
particle positions {riA} and {riB} of each system. As usual, the kinetic energy of collective motions
is characterized by the reduced mass µAB = MAMB/ (MA + MB), which is expressed in terms of
the total masses MA and MB of each system. The internal degrees of freedom must satisfy the
additional constraints for the center of mass:

Pα =Xiα

Mα Xiα

piα = 0 and Rα =

miα riα = 0.

(47)

A suitable expression for WAB that describes the lowest coupling among collective and internal
degrees of freedom is the quadrupole approximation:

unitary vector n = R/ |R|. Finally, Qαβ is the quadrupolar tensor of each system:

Qαβ =Xi

Second terms in (48) represent the called quadrupole-orbit coupling, which is schematically
represented in ﬁgure 10. Collective motions behave as a third astrophysical system C with low
dimensionality (one-body system). Expression (48) evidences that the interaction energy WAB is
a bulk eﬀect, which is determined by quantities that characterize the astrophysical systems as a
whole: their respective total masses [MA, MB], quadrupole tensors [QA, QB] and collective degrees
of freedom (R, P). Accordingly, the energy interchange among internal degrees of freedom of each
system is driven by the collective motions, which is a thermodynamic mechanism fully diﬀerent of
those ones that operate in extensive systems.

Since the characteristic timescale of collective motions τC signiﬁcantly greater than the
characteristic timescales of internal degrees of freedom, τC ≫ (τA, τB), one can consider a sort of
adiabatic approximation¶. Speciﬁcally, one can assume that the collective motions are practically

¶ Adiabatic approximation enters in quantum-mechanics description of atoms and molecules, where it is known
as Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Essentially, it assumes that the motions of atomic nuclei and electrons can
be separated, which is expressed by a factorization of wavefunction of a molecule into its electronic and nuclear
components Ψmolecular ≃ ΨnuclearΨelectronic. This approximation is justiﬁed because of electrons evolve much
faster than the nuclei due to the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in their masses. For the astrophysical case, the adiabatic
approximation is justiﬁed by the small values of the ratios τA,B /τC ≃ (cid:2)3(MA + MB)/R3ρA,B(cid:3)1/2 ≪ 1, where ρA,B
is a measure of central mass density of each system.

frozen when one is interested on the study of internal degrees of freedom, while the study the
collective motions can be performed by restricting to the average dynamical inﬂuence of internal
degrees of freedom.
In principle, this approximation could be employed to analyze aspects
concerning to equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium), such as stability conditions and the possible
generalized statistical ensembles, as well as non-equilibrium features like the heat transport. For
example, one could consider the dynamical evolution of collective degrees of freedom as a low
dimensional system that is coupled with two heat baths (the internal degrees of freedom of each
system). This is a typical arrangement employed in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, except for
the fact that these heat baths are actually astrophysical systems with negative heat capacities.

According to expression (48), the internal and collective degrees of freedom become almost
independent when the separation |R| is large enough. The entropy ST of the closed system can be
expressed as follows:

ST = SA + SB + SC + SABC ,

(50)

where (SA, SB, SC ) are the contributions of internal and collective degrees of freedom, while
SABC < 0 describes a reduction due to their existing correlations associated with the presence
of quadrupole terms in (48). Since the number of internal degrees of freedom of each system are
considerably much larger than the one of collective motions, it is natural to assume the application
of the following inequalities+:

|SABC| < |SC| ≪ min [|SA| ,|SB|]

whenever the separability of astrophysical systems A and B is a licit assumption. Accordingly, the
contributions SC and SABC can be neglected with a great accuracy, and the total entropy ST of
the closed system obeys additivity:

ST ≃ SA + SB.

(52)
Of course, this separability fails in the limit |R| → 0, where it takes places the merge of these
astrophysical systems.
The separability of these astrophysical system can guarantee the additivity of the total entropy
ST , but additivity of the total energy UT is not longer a licit approximation. In the framework of
adiabatic approximation, the statistical average of the interaction energy WAB can be regarded as
a function on the internal energies (UA, UB) of each system, where the collective degrees of freedom
(R, P) enter as external control parameters. The simplest situation is that the collective motions
nearly evolve along a circular orbit with the mean separation distance D. Considering the ansatz:

hWABi = W (UA, UB|D) ,

the additivity of the total energy UT = UA + UB is now replaced by the following constraint:

(51)

(53)

(54)

UT = UA + UB + W (UA, UB|D) .

This expression describes a non-linear energy interchange between the astrophysical systems, where
the amount of energy ∆UA transferred by the system A diﬀers from the amount of energy −∆UB
absorbed by the system B, and vice versa. A fraction of this energy is employed to change the
state of collective motions, and hence, the incidence of this eﬀect modiﬁes the conventional thermal
equilibrium conditions.

+ The entropy of any physical system is highly dependent on the number of particles N , while the internal energy
U appears in a logarithmic dependence. This fact can be veriﬁed in entropy estimation (82).

Combining the diﬀerential expression:

dUT =(cid:20)1 +(cid:18) ∂W

∂UA(cid:19)(cid:21) dUA +(cid:20)1 +(cid:18) ∂W

∂UB(cid:19)(cid:21) dUB = 0

Formally, equation (56) is a generalization of thermal equilibrium condition (5). Since βα =
∂Sα/∂Uα is the microcanonical inverse temperature of each system, the quantity ηα = φαβα is a
sort of eﬀective inverse temperature that accounts for the inﬂuence of collective motions. According
to the present analysis, the ordinary equalization of microcanonical inverse temperatures does not
hold in astrophysical situations. Nevertheless, this property can be generalized in terms of their
eﬀective inverse temperatures, equation (56). Considering an analogous procedure, one also obtains
the stability condition:

which generalizes inequality (6). Maximizing the total entropy ST considering the internal energy
UB of the system B, the factor φA in (58) is replaced by φB, which means that φAφB > 0.
According to this result, thermal equilibrium between two astrophysical systems crucially depends
on the non-linear energetic interchange throughout the collective motions. In particular, thermal
equilibrium between systems with negative heat capacities could be possible whenever energetic
interchange guarantees the inequality (58). Considering the limit φα → 1 when D → +∞, it is
natural to expect that the positive character of these quantities for relevant astrophysical situations,
φα > 0. Apparently, thermal stability for systems with negative heat capacities could be possible
if ∂φα/∂Uα < 0. Unfortunately, one cannot go more further in this analysis without considering a
concrete mathematical expression for the average interaction energy (53). Its form must be derived
from a thermo-statistical model that includes the inﬂuence of quadrupole-orbit coupling (48) on
the thermodynamics of internal degrees of freedom.

4.7. Roughly estimation of interaction energy WAB

Let us consider the co-moving reference frame that is located at the center of mass of one of the
systems, as example, the system A. Let us also consider that the separation vector R between the
centers of mass is ﬁxed along x-axis of this co-moving reference frame. For the sake of simplicity,
let us consider that the relative motion between the systems A and B is a circular orbit in the plane
x − y, with radius D and rotation frequency ωR:

(61)

The tidal potential (60) should be combined with Hamiltonian contribution HA of internal degrees
of freedom of the system A in order to develop a thermo-statistical model. Some features of this
situation are described by King model [16], but this later one disregards the anisotropic character
of the tidal ﬁeld (60), and hence, it cannot be employed to obtain the statistical average of the
interaction energy WAB. Denoting by HA = HA + Wtidal the full Hamiltonian of the system A, its
entropy SA = k ln ΩA can be estimated from the calculation of the density of states ΩA:

The integration over the N -body phase space PR should be regularized in similar fashion as the
one considered by quasi-ergodic model [52] to account for the energy threshold εc for particles
evaporation. This study is currently being developed in a separate work [81], which is a very
important task to address some other related problems.
In particular, this study sets the basis
for a possible generalization of conventional canonical or gran canonical ensembles to astrophysical
situations [82], as well as the derivation of a suitable Langevin-type equation to describe the energy
interchange between the astrophysical systems.

by introducing some suitable simplifying assumptions. For example,
let us assume that each
astrophysical system is mainly located inside a certain inner region (e.g.: the called isothermal
core of particles distribution) with average density ρA. The crudest description for dynamical
eﬀects of gravitational forces inside this region corresponds to the harmonic potential ﬁeld:

Here, it was employed the relation P2/2µAB = GMAMB/2D for kinetic and gravitational energy
for a motion along a circular orbit. If the separation distance D between the astrophysical systems
is suﬃciently large, the second term in the estimation (72) represents a small contribution that
introduces a perturbation for the collective motions. Thermodynamically, the quadrupole-orbit
coupling in (48) represents the astrophysical counterpart of thermal contact for the collective
motions. For small distances, the quadrupole contribution in (72) grows faster than the Newtonian
contribution, which could lead to the breakdown of eﬀective separability between the astrophysical
systems, and their eventual merge.

Quadrupole terms in (48) have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the thermodynamical behavior of each
system. In fact, these terms determine the stable branch between the point of gravitational collapse
uA and up to the point of evaporative disruption uC shown in ﬁgure 4. This contribution provides
a fairly estimation for the tidal radius Rt of globular clusters [3]:

RA ≡ Rt ≃ D (MA/2MB)1/3

(73)
for the asymptotic case MA ≪ MB. This radius characterizes the distance where the gravitational
inﬂuence of system A is overcome by gravitational ﬁeld of system B, and hence, it deﬁnes both the
linear size of system A and its threshold energy εc for particles escape. For a better understanding,
let us consider the estimation (73) and neglect the quadrupole deformation of the system B,
qB ≃ 0. Taking into account that NAkTA ∼ GM 2
A, so that, the
quadrupole contribution in (72) is of order (GMAMB/D) × (MA/MB)2/3 ≪ GMAMB/D. The
energy contribution of quadrupole-orbit coupling is much smaller than the Newtonian energy
contribution of collective motions. However, this energy is fully comparable to the internal energy
A/RA ∼ (GMAMB/D)× (MA/MB)2/3 ≪ GMAMB/D. These roughly
of the system A, |UA| ∼ GM 2
estimations evidence that the factor φA deﬁned in (57) is not necessarily small.

4.8. On the role of quadrupole-orbit coupling and angular momentum on the stability of a binary
system

As already shown, the quadrupole terms in (48) introduce, in average, a contribution 1/R6 in the
gravitational interaction between the astrophysical systems. This type of radial dependence should
be also observed for collective motions with non-circular orbits, so that, the dynamics of collective
motions could be described by the eﬀective Hamiltonian:

HC = P2/2µ + W (R).

The total potential V (R) is given by:

W (R) = −α/ |R| − αΘ/ |R|6

with parameters:

(74)

(75)

µ =

MAMB

MA + MB

, α = GMAMB and Θ =

ξA(6ξA + 1)qA + ξB(6ξB + 1)qB

2ξAξB

.

(76)

The second term of potential (75) is fully analogous to the leading term of Van der Waals potential
among non-polar molecules and atoms [1]:

WV dW (R) = −ǫ(cid:20)(cid:16) σ
R(cid:17)6

−(cid:16) σ

R(cid:17)12(cid:21) .

(77)

(78)

The same one becomes dominant if the systems A and B are suﬃciently close each other.
Accordingly, this term can explain an eventual the merge of these systems. Due to non-integrability
of this type of potential [83], the presence of this term could lead in certain conditions to the
dynamical instability of collective motions, that is, the existence of a chaotic behavior. The
conservation of the total angular momentum M for this situation enables the study of collective
motions in the orbital plane. Considering polar coordinates, the square of the linear momentum
can be spread into the radial and the angular contribution as P2 = P2
R + M2/R2. This procedure
enables the introduction of the eﬀective potential for the radial evolution as follows [23]:

Wef (R) = M2/2µR2 − α/R − αΘ/R6.

As clearly shown in the left panel of ﬁgure 11, this eﬀective potential provides valuable information
about the role of total angular momentum M and the quadrupole-orbit coupling on the stability
of this binary astrophysical system. For a given value M = |M| of the modulus of total angular
momentum M, there exist two critical values for quadrupole parameter Θ, Θc = (cid:0)2M 2/5µα(cid:1)5
/4
and Θs = (cid:0)4M 2/5µα(cid:1)5
/24. The ﬁrst value Θc guarantees that the local maximum of eﬀective
potential (78) is zero. The second value Θs guarantees that the only stationary point of potential
(78) is an inﬂexion point. Denoting by UC < 0 the energy of bounded collective motions, the
binary astrophysical system is always stable when Θ ≤ Θc. For the interval Θc < Θ < Θs, stable
collective motions are only possible for a certain energy window Umin ≤ UC < Umax < 0. The
minimal value Umin (circular orbits) weakly depends on the quadrupole parameter Θ, and its value
is close to Umin ≃ −0.5α2µ/M 2. Within the energy window Umax < UC < 0, collective motions
are unstable and the binary system collapses to form a single structure. Finally, the collective
motions are always unstable when Θ ≥ Θs. The present picture can be rephrased in terms of the
angular momentum for a ﬁxed value of quadrupole parameter Θ. In this case, the critical values of
quadrupole parameter provides two critical values for the modulus of the angular momentum Mc
and Ms:

Mc =h(4Θ)1/5 5µα/2i1/2

and Ms =h(24Θ)1/5 5µα/4i1/2

Figure 11. Left panel: Radial dependence of the eﬀective potential (78) for diﬀerent values of
quadrupole parameter Θ. Vertical and horizontal scales in this plot are expressed in units derived
from the total angular momentum M. Right panel: Schematic representation of the dependence
of the total entropy ST on the angular momentum. Two branches for low and high values of
momentum, where there is an intermediate region with a coexistence of single and double cluster
conﬁgurations.

Accordingly, binary system is stable if the modulus of angular momentum M > Mc. The merge
of these systems is always produced if the modulus of angular momentum M < Ms. Finally, both
conﬁgurations are possible for intermediate values of the angular momentum Ms < M < Mc.

The estimates (71) for the functions (qA, qB) only provide a qualitative dependence on the
internal thermodynamic conditions of each system. Their values decrease with the growth of the
inner density of each astrophysical system. Accordingly, the collective motions gain stability when
the interacting astrophysical systems exhibit more compact internal structures, that is, particles
distributions with more dense cores. The most compact structures are always observed for low
energies, which also correspond to conﬁgurations with negative heat capacities (see in ﬁgure 4).
Although in an indirect way, the coexistence of two interacting astrophysical systems with negative
heat capacity is convenient for the stability of collective motions. In summary, the stability binary
astrophysical system should be possible for low energies and large values of the angular momentum.
The merge of two astrophysical systems into a single astrophysical structure should be observed for
low energies and low values of the angular momentum. Finally, both type of conﬁgurations should
observed for intermediate values of angular momentum.

A more complete picture about dynamical and thermodynamical stability for the present
situation is obtained by including the incidence of thermal ﬂuctuations. Formally, this goal can be
achieved in the framework of classical ﬂuctuation theory [1] by considering concrete expressions
for the entropies of each system SA and SB and the energetic constraint (54).
In principle,
one can expect that dependence of total entropy ST = SA + SB on the angular momentum M
exhibits a behavior as the one schematically represented in ﬁgure 11. Here, I have included the
sketch of the stable branch that corresponds to the compound system resulting from the merge
of the astrophysical systems. Notice the existence of a region with intermediate values of angular
momentum Ms < M < Mc where one observes the coexistence of both conﬁgurations. It is clear

that for values of M near but below the point Mc, the binary system is not the only possible
conﬁguration, but it should be more probable than the compound system. Alternatively, the same
qualitative behavior should be expected for values of M close but above the point Mc for the
conﬁgurations of compound system. Therefore, these stable branches will intersect in a certain value
of the angular momentum Me. Conﬁgurations of binary system within the interval Ms < M < Me
(dashed red line) are metastable states since the conﬁgurations of compound system are more
probable (exhibit a greater entropy). Alternatively, conﬁgurations of compound system within the
interval Me < M < Mc (dashed black line) are also metastable states.

The picture described above agrees well with results reported by Votyakov and co-workers [84].
These authors considered an astrophysical system of identical non-relativistic particles with hard-
cores, which was enclosed into a container to avoid evaporation. They analyzed the thermodynamic
behavior of this system in the microcanonical description by imposing the conservation of energy
and the total angular momentum. The phase diagram of this model is reproduced in ﬁgure 12.
Conﬁgurations with large positive energies are now accessible, which correspond to a gas phase
as the case of Antonov isothermal model. Conﬁgurations with very low energies exhibit particles
distributions with a compact core, whose density is determined by the hard core-radius a of the
particles as nc ∼ 3/4πa3. Such conﬁgurations exhibit positive heat capacities, and they correspond
to the post-collapse phases. The thermodynamic behavior in this region crucially depends on the
total angular momentum. While one observes a single astrophysical structure (a singe cluster) for
low values of the total angular momentum, the system spontaneously develops binary conﬁgurations
(a double cluster) for values of angular momentum suﬃciently large. These phases are separate by
a region of phase coexistence (or mixed phases), where the closed system exhibits both single and

CONTENTS

35

double clusters conﬁgurations for intermediate values of angular momentum and negative values of
the heat capacity. In principle, the qualitative behavior of the total entropy ST represented in right
panel of ﬁgure 11 should be observed along conﬁgurations on the red dashed line highlighted in this
phase diagram.

4.9. Estimation of entropy using virial relations and associated thermodynamic limit

Taking into consideration Gibbs derivation of canonical ensemble, the possible extension of this
analysis for astrophysical situations will demand to invoke a suitable thermodynamic limit for the
system that acts as surrounding (see in ﬁgure 10). Of course, thermodynamic limit of conventional
extensive systems (43) is nonapplicable. In fact, astrophysical systems do not follow a universal
behavior as the case of extensive systems. Nevertheless, one could obtain some analogous scaling
relations among physical observables in certain limit situations. Scaling relations depend on the
concrete features of each astrophysical model, as example, if they are composed of point particles
or hard-core spheres, or the relativistic or non-relativistic character of their microscopic dynamics,
etc. In fact, the proper limit N → ∞ is meaningless for the case of compact objects in astrophysics
(e.g.: white dwarfs, neutron stars, etc.) because of the relativistic character of these astrophysical
structures imposes certain upper limits to the total mass to guarantee their stability [85, 86, 87].

It is possible to introduce a thermodynamic limit for the self-gravitating gas of identical non-
relativistic point particles. All models previously discussed in this work belong to this type of
astrophysical systems. Without any other external inﬂuence, this astrophysical system does not
exhibit any characteristic linear dimension or characteristic energy (in the framework of classical
mechanics), and the same one suﬀers from the incidence of evaporation. This situation was
previously considered during the analysis heat capacity of astrophysical systems using the virial
theorem, subsection 3.1. Let us now apply the same reasonings to obtain a roughly estimation for
the microcanonical entropy for this astrophysical system. Considering the virial relations for the
total kinetic energy K and the total potential energy W :

hKi = N(cid:10)p2/2m(cid:11) ∼ |U| and |U| ∼ − hWi /2 ∼ GM 2/R.

(80)
one obtains the following characteristic momentum |pc| ∼ (2m|U|/N )1/2 and radius Rc ∼ GM 2/|U|.
These characteristic quantities can be employed to estimate the accessible phase space volume Ω
(number of micro-states):

which yields the following estimation for the system entropy S = k ln Ω:

Ω ∼ (pcRc/)3N /N !,
S ∼ N k ln"(cid:18) G2m5

(82)

As usual, the factorial factor N ! was introduced to take into account the particles identity. It is
noteworthy that this situation is related to the one described by Plummer model.
In fact, the
estimation (82) can be improved starting from the usual deﬁnition:

S = −kZ f (r, p) ln [f (r, p)]

d3rd3p
(2π)3

(83)

and considering the quasi-stationary one-body distribution (34). However, this procedure can
hardly modify some numerical constants in the argument of logarithmic function. The existing

CONTENTS

36

dependence on energy U and physical constants remains unchanged since the logarithm argument
is mostly determined by the normalization constant A described in equation (36).

Let us analyze some consequences of the previous result. Considering that the total energy U
is negative, that is |U| ≡ −U , the virial estimation of heat capacity C = −3N k/2 is re-obtained
by combining the estimation (82) and deﬁnition (4). According to estimation (82), the entropy
per particle S/N remains ﬁnite in the thermodynamic limit N → ∞ considering the following
non-extensive scalings for the total energy and the characteristic radius R:

U/N 7/3 = const and RN 1/3 = const.

(84)

The present scaling relations have been obtained for more sophisticated astrophysical models of
non-relativistic point particles [52, 79, 88]. This thermodynamic limit evidences that astrophysical
systems are non-extensive. One could ﬁnd strange that the linear size R of the astrophysical system
decreases with the growth of the number of particles N . However, there is a simple explanation:
the size R is reduced because of the system gravitational ﬁeld becomes stronger with the grow of
its total mass M .

4.10. Other thermodynamic limits proposed in the literature

Recently, other investigators have claimed the physical relevance of other diﬀerent thermodynamics
limits for this same type astrophysical systems (with identical non-relativistic point particles). A
particular example is the called diluted-limit :

U/N = const and R/N = const

(85)

introduced by de Vega and Sanchez [75], where the energy U appears as an extensive quantity. This
thermodynamic limit exempliﬁes the Kac prescription [90], where some independent parameters of
a given model (e.g.: the linear dimension of container R) are re-scaled with the number of particles
N in order to force the extensivity of the total energy U , and hence, the intensive character of the
temperature T . Other proposal is the thermodynamic limit considered by Cerruti-Sola et al [89]:

U/N 5/3 = const and R/N 1/3 = const,

(86)
which now guarantees the extensivity of the system volume V ∼ R3 ∝ N . These last authors
presented a nice demonstration about a data collapsing of microcanonical caloric curves for diﬀerent
number of particles N once the above scaling laws for energy are introduced.

What criterium of thermodynamic limit is the fundamental one?

In general, the scaling
behaviors of macroscopic observables with N are irrelevant whenever the state equations of a
given astrophysical system are expressed in terms of dimensionless variables like u = U R/GM 2
and t = kT R/GM m. This criterium was adopted in ﬁgures 3 and 4 to describe the microcanonical
caloric curves of Antonov isothermal model and King model. However, I think that the scaling
laws should not be so arbitrary. If they exist in certain limit situations, it is natural to expect that
they would be intrinsic properties for a given thermodynamic system. In particular, this question
could be clariﬁed through the connections of these scaling laws with other macroscopic behaviors,
such as dynamic relaxation towards equilibrium, the correspondence between quantum and classical
(relativistic and non-relativistic) descriptions, etc.

Let us illustrate this argument considering that the astrophysical system of point particles is
a cloud of hydrogen atoms with mass m = mp. According to the estimation (82), its total non-
relativistic energy is of order U ∼ −G2m5
p/2N 7/3. The licitness of this estimation requires that
the absolute value of non-relativistic total energy U should be lower than the system rest energy

U0 = N mpc2, which is fulﬁlled when the total mass of the system M = N mp obeys the following
upper bound Mc:

p ≃ 29.2M⊙.

(87)

The quantity Mc is the characteristic mass that enters in stability limits of stars [85, 86, 87]. As
already commented by Chandrasekhar [49], in the same way that the Bohr radius aB = 2/e2me
explains the properties of atoms, the characteristic constant (87) explains why the stars are as
they are. This result can be obtained from the non-extensive thermodynamic limit (84) only. In
fact, this scaling laws arises for self-gravitating non-relativistic degenerate gas of fermions in white
dwarfs models. For example, the radius R of a white dwarf obeys the following scaling relation
with the total mass M :

R ∝

Gmem5/3

(88)

with β = ¯Z/ ¯A is the average number of electrons per nucleon, while me is the electron mass. This
is the same scaling law of the linear size R described in equation (84).

4.11. Astrophysical counterpart of Gibbs-Duhem relation

in the framework of Antonov isothermal model [75]. For the sake of convenience, I have restituted
here Planck constant , which was previously omitted by these authors by setting its value as  ≡ 1.
The function w(u, N ) is given by the multidimensional integral:

w(u, N ) =Z Yi

where υN (x) deﬁned as:

d3xi [u + υN (x)]3N/2−1 Θ [u + υN (x)] ,

(90)

(91)

υN (x) =

N 2 Xi<j

|xi − xj|

,

with u = U L/GM 2 being the dimensionless energy variable. Rigorously, equation (90) is a divergent
integral. The same one can be partially regularized in the framework of mean ﬁeld (continuum)
approximation. Other stronger regularization schemes are possible, such as the use of a small cutoﬀ
radius a to avoid divergence of Newtonian potential:

ϕa(xi, xj) =(cid:26)

1/a,

1/ |xi − xj| ,

if |xi − xj| < a,

otherwise.

(92)

The characteristic linear dimension L of the container was previously employed as the length unit
in order to express the integral expression (90) into dimensionless form. The particles positions r
were rewritten into dimensionless form as ri → xi = ri/L.

Let us pay attention to the ﬁrst term of the entropy (89). Considering Stirling approximation

where ℓG = 2/Gm3 is a characteristic length with a certain quantum signiﬁcance. Formally,
this is a gravitational counterpart of Bohr radius rB = 2/e2me. The physical meaning of the
characteristic length ℓG can be understood by analyzing the applicability of classical description of
the present self-gravitating gas. Denoting by d ∼ n−1/3 the characteristic separation among the
particles for the gas with mean density n, the quantum uncertainty of the total kinetic energy K
must satisfy the following condition:

Accordingly, the product LN 1/3 should remain constant in the thermodynamic limit N → +∞ to
guarantee the licitness of classical description, equation (95). If quantum behavior turns relevant,
the previous result can be reinterpreted to provide a fairly estimation for the system linear size as
a function on its total mass M :

thermodynamic identity in (98). Additionally, the chemical potential µ is obtained from the identity:

(102)

(103)

(104)

which is fully consistent with the thermodynamic limit (84). By itself, this last result provides a
very strong support about the relevance of thermodynamic limit (84) over any other proposal.

4.12. Relaxation time and thermodynamic limit

Let us analyze the relation between the thermodynamic limit (84) and the relaxation time of
gravitational systems. According to estimations derived from Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical
friction [49], the collisional relaxation time τcr can be expressed as follows:

τcr =

N
ln N

τd,

(105)

where τd = 1/(Gρ)1/2 is the characteristic time of microscopic dynamics (related to free-fall
frequency of particles (65) in a self-gravitating gas with average mass density ρ). Taking into
consideration that characteristic density ρ scales with the number of particles N as ρ ∼ N/R3 ∼ N 2,
one obtains that the collisional relaxation time scales as τcr = O(1/ ln N ). It is noteworthy that
the alternative thermodynamic limits (85) and (86) lead to the divergence of relaxation time when
N → +∞ as τcr = O(N 2/ ln N ) and τcr = O(N/ ln N ), respectively. A divergence of relaxation time
would imply the non-commutativity of thermodynamic limit and the inﬁnite time limit necessary
for convergence of temporal expectation values:

lim

N→+∞

lim

t→+∞

O(t, N ) 6= lim

t→+∞

lim

N→+∞

O(t, N ).

(106)

The use of these alternative thermodynamic limits implies an ill-deﬁned N -dependence of the system
temporal evolution. Among the three proposals considered in this work, the thermodynamic limit
(84) is the only one that fulﬁls commutativity of these two inﬁnite limits. Its non consideration
should lead to dynamical anomalies in numerical simulations [92].

The thermodynamic limit (84) almost guarantees that the collisional relaxation time (105)
becomes a N -independent quantity. This observation suggests the existence of a certain connection
between the thermodynamic limit that guarantees the extensivity of entropy and the timescale of
the system macroscopic relaxation. If exist this connection, the relevant relaxation timescale τr for
astrophysical systems should exhibit the form:

τr ∝ N τd.

(107)

Derivation of collisional relaxation time (105) involves a series of assumptions with a restricted
applicability. For example, the appearance of the term ln N in the estimation (105) depends on
the collective eﬀects that should be considered to avoid the short-range and long-range divergences
associated with Newtonian gravitation [91]. Collisional kinetic equations, such as Vlasov-Landau

CONTENTS

40

and Boltzmann equations, can be derived from Liuville equation and its associated BBGKY
hierarchy. However, such a procedure provides an inadequate treatment to the formation of
bound conﬁgurations with two or more particles, which is a very important behavior in presence of
gravitation.

4.13. Other antecedents and connections

The non-extensive thermodynamic limit (84) is not exclusive of astrophysical models analyzed in
this work. Its associated scaling laws (104) also arise in framework of Thomas-Fermy theory for the
asymptotic behaviors of atomic energy U (Z) and density ρZ (r) for an atom of charge Z suﬃciently
large [93, 94, 95, 96]:

U (Z) = CT F Z 7/3 + O(Z 2) and ρZ(r) ∼ ρZ

T F (r) = Z 2ρ1

T F (cid:16)Z 1/3r(cid:17) .

(108)

This precedent result strongly reinforces the idea that the scaling behavior (104) also apply for a
three-dimensional system of non-relativistic point particles that interact among them by means of
1/r potential without mattering about their quantum or classical behavior. As already commented
in subsection 4.10, the thermodynamic limit (84) is also relevant in Chandrasekhar theory of non-
relativistic white dwarfs [85]. This is a quite expected result because of this physical theory is a
gravitational analogous to Thomas-Fermy theory of electrons in atoms [93]. In principle, the non-
extensive thermodynamic limit (84) should apply for pure non-neutral plasmas that are conﬁned
by external magnetic and electric ﬁelds, e.g.: a pure electron plasma [97].

The generalization of Gibbs-Duhem relation for systems with long-range interactions was
recently addressed by Latella and co-workers in Refs.
[98, 99]. Roughly speaking, these authors
shown that the non-extensive (or non-additive in their terminology) properties certain systems will
introduce an additional term E in the original Gibbs-Duhem relation as follows:

for the particular case of a d-dimensional classical self-interacting gas of non-relativistic point
particles enclosed inside an impenetrable container of linear dimension R:

HN (r, p) =Xi

1
2m

p2

i +Xi<j

Aij

|ri − rj|ν .

(111)

If the exponent of radial dependence of interaction potential is ν = 1, the generic Hamiltonian
system (111) includes the self-gravitating gas with Newtonian gravitation for coupling coeﬃcients
Aij = −Gmimj and the non-neutral Coulombian plasma when Aij = qiqj.
In general, I am in fully agreement with all technical and conceptual aspects discussed by these
authors. However, is formula (109) an appropriate extension of Gibbs-Duhem relation? Without
specifying the concrete mathematical expression of the quantity E, this expression seems to be
more a deﬁnition for the replica energy E rather than a thermo-statistical identity. In principle,
it is not necessarily a limitation. As a deﬁnition, this expression will be always applicable to any
thermodynamic situation because of E is a measure about the deviation from extensive properties.

which they referred to as the replica energy. They also showed that this quantity can be expressed
in terms of the total potential energy W as follows:

E = U − T S + pV − µN,

E = −σW with σ = (d − ν)/d

(109)

(110)

CONTENTS

41

This means that replica energy, in a certain sense, is a relative notion. For example, one can invoke
the same arguments to introduce an astrophysical counterpart for the replica energy Ea as follows:
(112)

Ea =

U − T S − pV − µN,

7
3

which characterizes the deviation of the scaling properties of a given system with respect to the
ones associated with a 3D astrophysical system composed of non-relativistic point particles. For
the generic Hamiltonian system (111), one obtains the following relation:

Ea ≡

4
3d

(d − 3) K +

1
3d

(d − 3ν) W,

(113)

where K is the total kinetic energy. Notice that this quantity vanishes for the astrophysical case
where d = 3 and ν = 1.

Conventionally, Gibbs-Duhem relation is a thermodynamical

identity that follows as a

consequence of extensive properties of large short-range interacting systems:

S(αU, αN, αV ) = αS(U, N, V ) ⇒ S =

1
T

(U + pV − µN ) .

(114)

It is easy to realize that the astrophysical relations (103) and (104) exhibit the same geometric
signiﬁcance. Latella and co-workers do not enter to analyze the scaling laws and the thermodynamic
limit associated with the generic Hamiltonian system (111). Taking into consideration the equations
of state:

pV = N kT + νW/d and K = dN kT /2,

(115)

one can repeat the same procedure presented in subsection 4.11 to obtain the corresponding Gibbs-
Duhem relation:

S =

1
T

(κU + γpV − µN ) .

The coeﬃcients κ and γ depends on (d, ν) as:

κ =

4d − dν − 2ν

d(2 − ν)

and γ = −

d − 2
2 − ν

,

which are the exponents of the following scaling laws:

S (ακU, αγV, αN ) = αS(U, V, N ).

(116)

(117)

(118)

According to the present results, the generic Hamiltonian system (111) should obey the following
thermodynamic limit N → +∞:

U/N κ = const and V /N γ = const.

(119)
In particular, the results (84), (103) and (104) with exponents κ = 7/3 and γ = −1 are obtained
for d = 3 and ν = 1. However, the identity (116) undergoes the same limitation of its extensive
counterpart: it is a non-universal relation. In other words, the concrete mathematical form of this
type of thermodynamical identity should depend on the speciﬁc scaling properties of the entropy
S(U, V, N ), whose existence is not a priori guaranteed for any non-extensive system. Anyway, it is
important to remark that this perspective does not deny, but complements the one proposed by
Latella and co-workers.

A model system with nontrivial scalings law is the classical self-gravitating gas of identical
non-relativistic particles with a hard-core radius a, which regularizes the short-range divergence of
Newtonian inter-particles interaction energy as follows:

w (ri, ri|a) =(cid:26)

if |ri − rj| < a,

otherwise.

(120)

+∞

−Gmimj/ |ri − rj|

The ﬁnite size of system particles can be disregarded in the limit of large energies and low densities,
where one should expect the applicability of the non-extensive thermodynamic limit (84). However,
the non-vanishing hard-core radius a turns relevant in the limit of low energies and high densities,
where one should expect the applicability of the non-extensive thermodynamic limit (86) introduced
by Cerruti-Sola et al [89]. The concrete form of scaling laws of this self-gravitating system outside
these two limit situations, if exist, does not follow the power-law behaviors as the one shown in
equation (118).

4.14. Merge of two identical astrophysical systems

Let us ﬁnally analyze the incidence of nonextensivity on the merge of astrophysical systems. This
is an example of an out-of-equilibrium process. During the relaxation dynamics that follows after
the merge, a fraction of particles can escape from the compound system. For the sake of simplicity,
let us suppose that the number of these evaporation events is very small, which enable us to
consider that the total energy and the number of particles remain approximately ﬁxed during the
relaxation. Of course, this is a very simplifying assumption whose validity should be veriﬁed from
their consequences. Let us consider here two diﬀerent situations: (i) the merge of two identical
astrophysical systems that are isolated from the gravitational inﬂuence of other astrophysical
systems, and (ii) the merge of two identical astrophysical systems that are under the gravitational
inﬂuence of a third very large astrophysical system.

For the ﬁrst situation, let us employ the estimation (82) considering two identical isolated
astrophysical systems with energy U and particles number N . Let us suppose that these systems
were inﬁnitely far each other at the initial state, so that, their interaction energy is exactly zero and
their total entropy is additive and given by Si = 2S (U, N ). Once the compound system ﬁnishes
its relaxation, its ﬁnal entropy can be evaluated from the entropy (82) with energy Uf = 2U and
particles number Nf = 2N , and therefore:

Sf = S (2U, 2N ) = 2S (U, N ) + 4N k log 2.

(121)

Since the ﬁnal entropy Sf is greater than the initial entropy Si, the merge of the astrophysical
systems is an irreversible process that leads to increase thermodynamic stability. This situation
diﬀers from the one considered in Gibbs paradox [1], where the total entropy remains unchanged
after the merge of two identical extensive systems (e.g.: gases or liquids initially divided by a
separation wall). Temperature does not change during the merge, kT ∼ −2U/3N . However, the
characteristic linear size of the system Rc ∼ GM 2/ |U| is duplicated. It means that the merge leads
to a reconﬁguration of particles distribution. Hence, the growth of the entropy is related to the fact
that the system ﬁnal volume Vf = 8V is four times the initial volume Vi = 2V . This behavior is a
consequence of non-extensive character of astrophysical systems.

Let us now consider the second situation:

the merge of two identical open astrophysical
systems (e.g.: two globular clusters) that are under the gravitational inﬂuence of a third very large
astrophysical system (e.g.: their host galaxy). Formally, each system of this situation could be
described by King model discussed in subsection 3.3. Let us suppose that these systems evolve

CONTENTS

43

in opposite directions along a same circular orbit of around a galaxy with a very large mass
MG ≫ Ms. This consideration enables us neglect the interaction energy W between them in
comparison with their respective internal energies Us when they are located in diametral position
in that circular orbit. Precisely, the internal energy of these systems is of order |Us| ∼ GM 2
s /Rs,
s /2RO, where Rs ∼ RO(Ms/2MG)1/3 (tidal radius of
while the interaction energy |W| ∼ GM 2
equation (73) above). Since Ms ≪ MG ⇒ |W| ≪ |U|. After the formation of compound system
and its relaxation, the ﬁnal values of the total energy and the mass of the compound system (c)
duplicate the initial values of each system, Mc = 2Mc and Uc = 2Us, while its radius only increases
as Rc = 21/3Rs. Accordingly, the ﬁnal dimensionless energy uc = 2−2/3us is now increased. Note
that uc > us because of us < 0 (for bounded stable conﬁgurations). Once again, the total entropy
of the compound system is greater than the one of the initial conﬁguration:

∆S = Sc (Uc, Mc, Rc) − 2S (Us, Ms, Rs) = 2N [s(uc) − s(us)] + 2N ln 2 > 0. (122)
The diﬀerence of the reduced entropy s(uc) − s(us) is positive since η(u) = ∂s(u)/∂u > 0, with
η(u) = GM m/T Rt is the dimensionless inverse temperature. This diﬀerence can be evaluated from
the integral:

s(uc) − s(us) =Z uc

us

η(u)du > 0

(123)

using the temperature versus energy dependence shown in ﬁgure 4. The additional contribution

2N ln 2 was obtained assuming the relevance of the factor ∼ 3N ln(cid:2)RtN 1/3(cid:3) in analogy with

expression (93), which considers the scaling dependence of the characteristic linear size for a non-
relativistic gas of identical point particles.
Interestingly, the present situation should also obey
an additional restriction: the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the compound system could be stable if its
dimensionless energy uc is lower than the critical energy of the evaporative disruption uC = −0.601.
Accordingly, the ﬁnal conﬁguration of the compound system will be unstable if the initial energy us
of each system belongs to the interval u∗
C = 22/3uC = −0.954, and therefore,
it will undergo a sudden evaporation to release its excess of energy and particles. The initial
hypothesis about the constancy of the total energy and the number of particles cannot be fulﬁlled
in this case. This is other example that an external inﬂuence can introduce a great aﬀectation in
some thermodynamic behaviors and processes in astrophysics.

C < us < uC with u∗

5. Final remarks

Conventional thermo-statistical treatments and some of their associated notions have a restricted
applicability in the context of astrophysical systems. The long-range character of gravitation
presupposes a strong limitation for the licitness of notions such as separability and additivity,
thermal contact, extensive and intensive quantities, and hence, applicability of conventional
statistical ensembles. So far, the usage of these notions and frameworks is highly motivated by
our everyday practical experience with large extensive systems.
In one way or another, these
idealizations play a crucial role in our understanding of macroscopic phenomena of this context,
which include thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, transport processes, phase transitions, among
others.

Separability and additivity under a thermal contact is not longer a licit idealization to study
astrophysical systems in mutual thermodynamic interaction. However, restricted forms of these
properties are still possible when there exists an eﬀective separability among the collective and the
internal degrees of freedom of these systems. The collective motions are now responsible to drive the

CONTENTS

44

interaction among the astrophysical systems. This mechanism replaces the conventional thermal
contact and introduces signiﬁcant modiﬁcations in thermal equilibrium conditions [including the
stationary conditions (equalization of temperatures) and stability conditions (restrictions over
response functions)] and the energy transport. A plausible consequence of this mechanism is that
thermal equilibrium could be possible among astrophysical systems with negative heat capacities.
Moreover, distribution proﬁles with very dense cores, which are associated with states with negative
heat capacities, favor the stability of collective motions of two interacting astrophysical systems.

Thermodynamic behavior of astrophysical systems exhibits a strong dependence on the external
backgrounds conditions. The incidence of a long-range interaction as gravitation imposes that all
constituents are strongly correlated among them. In this way, any external inﬂuence, even acting
on the system boundary, will propagates to the whole astrophysical structure and modiﬁes its
macroscopic behavior in a radical way. By itself, this is why the thermodynamics of astrophysical
systems is so rich and challenging. Qualitatively speaking, astrophysical systems exhibit general
features such as negative heat capacities and gravitational collapse. However, the concrete
quantitative characterization of these macroscopic phenomena depends on the external conditions
that aﬀect each astrophysical situation.

Although a universal thermodynamic limit for astrophysical systems is not possible, some
analogous scaling relations are possible for certain situations. In particular, the scaling laws (84) can
be regarded as the right thermodynamic limit for a three-dimensional self-gravitating gas of identical
non-relativistic point particles regardless their classical or quantum nature. This thermodynamic
limit has been already obtained in other works in the literature [52, 79, 88], and its relevance is now
supported by an astrophysical counterpart of Gibbs-Duhem relation (103). For real astrophysical
situations, these scaling laws are restricted by the incidence of relativistic eﬀects. According to the
arguments presented during comparison with other thermodynamic limits, extensivity of entropy
seems to be a more general property than any other criterium to establish a scaling behavior for
macroscopic observables (e.g.: the called Kac prescription [90]). Conceptually, this idea is quite
satisfactory because of the entropy is the central notion of thermo-statistical description.

Several analysis presented in this work are far to be complete. A deeper study of these
questions should lead to the new theoretical developments such as the astrophysical counterparts of
conventional canonical and gran canonical statistical ensembles, as well as a better understanding
of phase transitions and critical phenomena in astrophysics. Our understanding of thermodynamic
processes that involve interaction among astrophysical systems still demands much work in future
years. A particular attention should be devoted to the peculiarities of the transport processes of
energy and matter in presence of long range interactions and systems with negative heat capacities.
Conventional kinetic equations that are employed to describe these non-equilibrium processes were
not conceived to deal with these macroscopic behaviors.
