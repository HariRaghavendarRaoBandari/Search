property. We show that the following conditions are equivalent:
(i) Ω is a John domain;
(ii) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), the Korn inequality holds for each u ∈
W1,p(Ω, Rn) satisfyingRΩ

(iii) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), for each f ∈ Lp(Ω) with vanishing mean
value on Ω, there exists a solution v ∈ W1,p
0 (Ω, Rn) to the equation div v = f
with

kvkW1,p(Ω,Rn) ≤ C(Ω, p)k fkLp(Ω).

For domains satisfying the separation property, in particular, for simply-
connected domains in the plane, our result not only gives a positive answer

Introduction

Let Ω be a bounded domain in Rn, n ≥ 2. Throughout the paper we assume that p is a
real number in the interval (1, ∞). For each vector ﬁeld v = (v1, · · · , vn) ∈ W1,p(Ω, Rn), let
Dv denotes its (distributional) gradient matrix, ǫ(v) denotes the symmetric part of Dv., i.e.,
ǫ(v) = (ǫi, j(v))1≤i, j≤n with

The Korn inequality (Kp) is a fundamental tool in the theory of elasticity equations and ﬂuid
mechanics; we refer the reader to [1, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 20] and the references therein.

The study of Korn inequality on domains has a long history. Friedrichs [12] proved the
Korn inequality (Kp) for p = 2 on domains with a ﬁnite number of corners or edges on
∂Ω. Neˇcas [25] proved the Korn inequality on bounded Lipschitz domains. Kondratiev and
Oleinik [20] studied the Korn inequality (K2) on star-shaped domains. Recently, Acosta,
Dur´an and Muschietti [1] proved the Korn inequality (in a diﬀerent form than (Kp)) holds
for all p ∈ (1, ∞) on John domains (see Deﬁnition 1.1 below). We refer the reader to
[7, 24, 26, 30, 2, 3, 16] for more studies on the Korn inequality. It is worth to mention that
the Korn inequality (Kp) fails for p = 1 even on a cube; see the example from [8].

Recently, there have been some studies concerning the Korn inequality for more irregular
domains, such as H¨older domains and s-John domains with s > 1. It turns out the Korn
inequality (Kp) does not hold for any 1 < p < ∞ on these domains, and instead there are
weighted versions of the Korn inequality; see [2, 3, 16] for instance.
Then one may wonder, is John condition also necessary for domains to support the Korn

inequality? Generally speaking, one may ask

Question A: What is the geometric counterpart of the Korn inequality (Kp)? Is there
a necessary and suﬃcient geometric condition on the domain under consideration for the
Korn inequality to hold?

On the other hand, there are some inequalities that are known to be equivalent to the
Korn inequality, on (regular) planar domains; cf. [9, 15, 29]. In [15], Horgan and Payne
proved that on suﬃcient smooth planar domains, the Korn inequality (K2), the Friedrichs
inequality and the Babuˇska-Aziz inequality are equivalent to each other with equivalence of
constants.

Recall that, the Friedrichs inequality states that for all conjugate harmonic functions h, g

on a plane domain Ω, if h, g ∈ L2(Ω) are of vanishing mean value, then it holds

khkL2(Ω) ≤ CkgkL2(Ω);

cf. [11, 15, 9]. The Babuˇska-Aziz inequality (cf. [5, 15, 9]) for the divergence equation
states that, for each f ∈ L2(Ω) with vanishing mean value on a plane domain Ω, there exists
a solution v ∈ W1,p

0 (Ω, R2) to the equation div v = f with
kvkW1,2(Ω,R2) ≤ Ck fkL2(Ω).

Recently, Costabel and Dauge [9] veriﬁed the equivalence of the Friedrichs inequality
and the Babuˇska-Aziz inequality with equality of constants on bounded domains, without
requiring any (smooth) regularity of the domain, and they asked the following question:

Question B:

Is Korn’s inequality equivalent to the Babuˇska-Aziz inequality, without

requiring a priori (smooth) regularity on the domain under consideration?

The implication of Korn’s inequality from the Babuˇska-Aziz inequality is well-known

(cf. [1, 9]), while the reverse part remains open.

Neˇcas [25] had proved Lp-version of the Babuˇska-Aziz inequality for 1 < p < ∞ on
Lipschitz domains. Acosta, Dur´an and Muschietti [1] extended solvability of the divergence

equation on John domains in Rn, n ≥ 2, via a constructive approach. In [17], the authors
with P. Koskela showed that on a bounded simply-connected domain Ω in R2, the divergence
equation is solvable in W1,p
0 (Ω, R2) (1 < p < ∞), if and only if Ω is a John domain. This
implies that, in particular, on a bounded simply-connected plane domain, the Babuˇska-Aziz
inequality holds if and only if the domain is a John domain.

Therefore, if Korn’s inequality equivalent to the Babuˇska-Aziz inequality, then the do-
main in some sense has to be a John domain, and this will also answer our Question A. The
main aim of this paper is to provide positive answers to Questions A and B, if the domain
additionally satisﬁes a condition known as the separation property. This condition, which is
deﬁned below, is valid on every simply-connected plane domain.

Before moving further, let us ﬁrst recall the deﬁnition of a John domain. This termi-
nology was introduced in [22], but these domains were studied already by F. John [18]. In
what follows, for each x ∈ Ω, we denote by ρ(x) the distance of x to the boundary of Ω, i.e.,
d(x, ∂Ω).

Deﬁnition 1.1 (John domain). A bounded domain Ω ⊂ Rn with a distinguished point x0 ∈ Ω
is a John domain if there exists a constant CJ > 0 such that for all x ∈ Ω, there is a
curve γ : [0, l(γ)] → Ω parametrised by arclength such that γ(0) = x, γ(l(γ)) = x0, and
ρ(γ(t)) ≥ CJt.

The deﬁnition says that each point in a John domain can be joined to the center point with
a twisted cone. Clearly, the requirements for being a John domain are much weaker than
that for being Lipschitz domains. In particular, every Lipschitz domain is a John domain
and John domains may have fractal boundary (e.g., Von Koch snowﬂake domain).

An additional requirement on the domain, which we will rely on heavily, is the following
separation property, which was introduced by Buckley and Koskela [6], where the separa-
tion property was used to prove the geometric counterpart of Sobolev-Poincar´e inequalities.

Deﬁnition 1.2 (Separation property). A domain Ω ⊂ Rn with a distinguished point x0 has
the separation property if there is a constant Cs ≥ 1 such that the following holds: for each
x ∈ Ω there is a curve γ : [0, 1] → Ω with γ(0) = x, γ(1) = x0, and such that for each
t either γ([0, t]) ⊂ B := B(γ(t), Csρ(γ(t))) or each y ∈ γ([0, t]) \ B belongs to a diﬀerent
component of Ω \ ∂B than x0. In the latter case, we call B a separating ball, and call the
union of components of Ω \ B not containing x0 as B -end and denoted by EB.

In [6] it is proved that, every domain Ω, which is quasiconformally equivalent to a
uniform domain (cf. Jones [19]) has the separation property. In particular, each simply-
connected plane domain has the separation property.

Our main result below gives positive answers to Questions A and B, if the domain addi-

tionally satisﬁes the separation property.

Theorem 1.1. Let Ω be a bounded domain of Rn, n ≥ 2. Suppose that Ω satisﬁes the
separation property. Then the following statements are equivalent:

(i) Ω is a John domain;

4

(ii) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), the Korn inequality holds for each u ∈ W1,p(Ω, Rn)
satisfyingRΩ κi, j(v) dx = 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, as

(Kp)

(iii) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), each u ∈ W1,p(Ω, Rn) satisﬁes the Korn inequality
(eKp)
(iv) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), it holds for all v ∈ W1,p(Ω, Rn) that
(bKp)
(v) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), for each f ∈ Lp(Ω) with vanishing mean value on Ω,
there exists a solution v ∈ W1,p

kDvkLp(Ω) ≤ CKnkǫ(v)kLp(Ω) + kDvkLp(Q)o ,

0 (Ω, Rn) to the equation div v = f with

where Q is a ﬁxed cube compactly supported in Ω;

kvkW1,p(Ω,Rn) ≤ Cdk fkLp(Ω).

Notice that the inequality (eKp) can be equivalently stated with the inﬁmum extended
over all matrices S ∈ Rn×n. The meaning of “some (every)” in the statement above is that
the given existence result for any ﬁxed p in the given parameter range actually implies the
existence for every such p, under the assumptions of the theorem.

By [6, Theorem 1.1], any of the above ﬁve conditions is further equivalent to a Sobolev-

Poincar´e inequality, as

 ZΩ |u − uΩ|np/(n−p) dx!(n−p)/np

≤ C ZΩ |∇u|p dx!1/p

,

for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ [1, n), where uΩ denotes the average of integral of u on Ω.
The implication (i) =⇒ (v) was proved in [1], where the separation property is not re-
quired. The implication (v) =⇒ (ii), (iii), (iv) is rather standard; see Section 2. In [17],
with Koskela, the authors have proven (v) =⇒ (i), except for p , n ≥ 3, directly by using
Poincar´e inequality and Hardy inequality. Therefore, Theorem 1.1 improves also this result
slightly.

The main achievement of this paper is that we show that (ii), (iii), (iv) =⇒ (i) is also
true, if the domain satisﬁes the separation property, which holds in particular on simply-
connected domain Ω in the plane.

Corollary 1.1. Let Ω be a bounded simply-connected domain in R2. Then the following
statements are equivalent:
(i) Ω is a John domain;
(ii) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), the Korn inequality (Kp) holds;
(iii) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), the Korn inequality (eKp) holds;
(iv) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), the Korn inequality (bKp) holds;

Korn inequality and John domain

5

(v) for a ﬁxed (every) p ∈ (1, ∞), for each f ∈ Lp(Ω) with vanishing mean value on Ω,

0 (Ω, R2) to the equation div v = f with

there exists a solution v ∈ W1,p

kvkW1,p(Ω,R2) ≤ Ck fkLp(Ω).

The above corollary together with [9, Theorem 2.1] and [6] shows

Corollary 1.2. Let Ω be a bounded simply-connected domain in R2. Then the following
statements are equivalent:
(i) Ω is a John domain;
(ii) The Korn inequality (K2) holds;
(iii) The Babuˇska-Aziz inequality holds;
(iv) The Friedrichs inequality holds.

The proof of Theorem 1.1, in particular, the proof of (ii), (iii), (iv) =⇒ (i), will be divided
into two steps. In the ﬁrst step, we will give a geometric characterization of the John do-
mains via controlling the measure of ends by separating balls. We expect such a geometric
characterization will have independent interest. In the second step, we ﬁrst construct good
test functions, and then use the Korn inequalities and this characterization of John domains
to conclude the claim.

One may wonder if the assumption of separation property can be removed from Theorem
1.1, but at least our methods do not seem to work without it. If the Korn inequality (Kp)
holds for a certain simply-connected domain Ω in the plane, then after removing any count-
able set K, the Korn inequality (Kp) still holds in Ω \ K. However, the geometry of Ω \ K
can be rather complicated. In particular the domain, might not be John domain anymore.
The same can be done with uncountable set E as long it is removable for W1,p.

There is a diﬀerent type of Korn inequality

kDvkLp(Ω) ≤ Cnkǫ(v)kLp(Ω) + kvkLp(Ω)o .

(bKp,w)
Obviously, (bKp,w) is weaker than (bKp). Even on simply-connected planar domain, we do
not know how to obtain the geometric counterpart of (bKp,w). Indeed, as observed in [16], if
two disjoint domains support (bKp,w), respectively, then their union admits a (bKp,w), possibly
with larger constant. However, (Kp) or (bKp) does not have this property. Therefore, in this
case it looks hard to derive the same geometric counterpart as from (Kp) or (bKp).

There is also an open problem regarding the relation of the constants in (K2) and the
Babuˇska-Aziz inequality, which is open even on Lipschitz domains; see [9]. Our result
does not give any information on the optimal constant in these inequalities.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we recall some known result on the
divergence equation, and provide the proofs for the implications (v) =⇒ (ii), (iii), (iv) for
completeness. In Section 3, we provide a geometric characterization of the John domains.
In Section 4 and Section 5, we will prove (ii), (iii), (iv) =⇒ (i).
Throughout the paper, we denote by C positive constants which are independent of the
main parameters, but which may vary from line to line. For matrices S ∈ Rn×n we use the

6

norm kSk := max{|si, j| : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}. Our Sobolev spaces are deﬁned in the usual way
as [23], the space Lp
0(Ω) denotes the collection of all Lp-integrable functions on Ω with
vanishing mean value.

2 The divergence equation and Korn inequality

In this section, let us recall the known results on the divergence equation and its applica-

tions to the Korn inequality.
Theorem 2.1 ([1]). Let q ∈ (1, ∞) and Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded John domain. Then for each
f ∈ Lq

0(Ω), there exists a solution v ∈ W1,q

0 (Ω, Rn) to the equation div v = f with

kvkW1,q(Ω,Rn) ≤ Ck fkLq(Ω).

Above for p = 2, the inequality is usually referred as the Babuˇska-Aziz inequality.
Notice that, with the help of the above regularity result of divergence equation, it is

somehow standard to show that on John domains, the Korn inequalities (Kp), (eKp) and (bKp)
hold. We provide a proof for completeness.
Corollary 2.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded John domain. Then for each p ∈ (1, ∞), the Korn
inequalities (Kp), (eKp) and (bKp) hold on Ω.

3 A geometric characterization of John domains

In this section, assuming the separation property, we explore another characterization of
the John condition. We shall show that a domain is John if and only if the measures of ends
are controlled with measures of separating balls. Similar arguments have been previously
used to show necessity of John condition in other contexts in [13] and [6]. For the proof
we need the following lemma originally from [4, Lemma 3.1] and the well-known Whitney
decomposition (see eg. [28]).

Lemma 3.1 ([4]). Let 1 ≤ a < ∞ and let x j be a sequence of nonnegative numbers such
that for all k ∈ N

∞Xj=k

∞Xj=k

x j ≤ bxk.

xα
j ≤ cxα
k .

Then for every α ∈ (0, 1] there exists a constant c ≥ 1, depending only on b, α, such that for
all k ∈ N

Lemma 3.2. For any Ω ⊂ Rn there exists a collection W = {Q j} j∈N of countably many
closed dyadic cubes such that
(i) Ω = ∪ j∈NQ j, and if k , j, then the cubes have disjoint interiors, (Q j)◦ ∩ (Qk)◦ = ∅,
(ii) √nℓ(Qk) ≤ dist (Qk, ∂Ω) ≤ 4√nℓ(Qk) and
(iii) 1

4 ℓ(Qk) ≤ ℓ(Q j) ≤ 4ℓ(Qk) whenever Qk ∩ Q j , ∅.

Remember that Whitney decompositions are not unique. The following statement holds

for any ﬁxed W.
Proposition 3.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a domain satisfying the separation property with constant
Cs ≥ 1 and a distinguished point x0. For each point x ∈ Ω, there is a curve γ connecting
x to x0 that satisﬁes the separation property with constant 5Cs, and for each Whitney cube
Q ∈ W, the set Q ∩ γ has at most one component.
Proof. Let x ∈ Ω be a point and let γ : [0, 1] → Ω with γ(0) = x, γ(1) = x0 be a curve given
by the separation condition. We may assume the curve γ has no self-intersecting points,
otherwise, if there exist 0 ≤ r < t ≤ 1 such that γ(r) = γ(t), then one can modify the curve
γ as ˜γ : [0, r] ∪ [t, 1] 7→ Ω, and ˜γ is a curve that connects x and x0 satisfying the separation
property with the constant Cs.
Now consider the collection Wγ of all Whitney cubes that intersect γ. Notice that since γ
is a compact set in Ω, such a collection Wγ is of ﬁnite elements. If for each Q ∈ Wγ, Q ∩ γ
has at most one component, then we are done. Otherwise, for each cube Q for which Q ∩ γ
has more than one component, let tu = sup{t : γ(t) ∈ Q} and tl = inf{t : γ(t) ∈ Q}, and
replace the curve γ([tl, tu]) by the line segment ℓγ(tl),γ(tu). In such a way, we obtain a new
curve ˜γ connecting x to x0. After reparametrisation, we denote the curve by ˜γ : [0, 1] 7→ Ω.

Claim. The curve ˜γ connecting x and x0 satisﬁes the separation condition with constant

5Cs.

In what follows, for convenience, denote B(γ(t), Csρ(γ(t))) and B(˜γ(t), 5Csρ(˜γ(t))) by

Bγ,t and B ˜γ,t respectively.

Let t ∈ [0, 1]. If ˜γ([0, t]) ⊂ B ˜γ,t then the conclusion follows. Suppose that ˜γ([0, t])\B ˜γ,t ,
Case 1. ˜γ(t) ∈ γ([0, 1]).
Let tγ ∈ [0, 1] be such that γ(tγ) = ˜γ(t). Notice that by the construction of ˜γ, ˜γ([0, t]) \
γ([0, tγ]) only contains line segments, whose endpoints belong to γ([0, tγ]). From this we
see that γ([0, tγ]) \ B ˜γ,t , ∅, otherwise we have ˜γ([0, t]) ⊂ B ˜γ,t.
, ∅. By the separation
property, each y ∈ γ([0, tγ])\Bγ,tγ and x0 belong to diﬀerent component of Ω\∂Bγ,tγ. Hence,
we see that each

Since B ˜γ,t = 5Bγ,tγ and γ([0, tγ])\B ˜γ,t , ∅, we have γ([0, tγ])\Bγ,tγ

Now, if (˜γ([0, t]) \ γ([0, tγ])) ∩ Bγ,tγ

, ∅, then there is a line segment ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) \ B ˜γ,t , ∅
and ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) ⊂ (˜γ([0, t]) \ γ([0, tγ])). For each y ∈ ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) \ B ˜γ,t, there is one end-point of
ℓγ(tl),γ(tu), which we assume to be γ(tl), that also belongs to ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) \ B ˜γ,t and connects to y
in the segment. Since γ(tl) ∈ γ that belongs to a diﬀerent component of Ω \ ∂B ˜γ,t than x0,
we ﬁnd that the set ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) \ B ˜γ,t belong to a diﬀerent component of Ω \ ∂B ˜γ,t than x0, as
desired.

Case 2. ˜γ(t) ∈ ˜γ([0, 1]) \ γ([0, 1]).
By the construction of the curve ˜γ, we see that there is a line segment ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) ⊂ ˜γ([0, 1]),
that contains ˜γ(t) and belongs to a Whitney cube Q. Notice that the length of ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) is no
bigger than √nℓ(Q), which is no bigger than ρ(˜γ(t)) or ρ(γ(tl)). Therefore, ℓγ(tl),γ(tu) ⊂ B ˜γ,t,

ρ(γ(tl)) ≤ d(Q, ∂Ω) + √nℓ(Q) ≤ 2ρ(˜γ(t))

and

Bγ,tl

= B(γ(tl), Csρ(γ(tl))) ⊂ B(˜γ(t), 5Csρ(˜γ(t))) = B ˜γ,t.

If y ∈ ˜γ([0, t]) \ B ˜γ,t and y ∈ γ([0, 1]), then

y ∈ γ([0, tl]) \ B ˜γ,t ⊂ γ([0, tl]) \ Bγ,tl.

Since γ satisﬁes the separation property, this implies that y and x0 belong to diﬀerent com-
ponents of Ω \ ∂Bγ,tl, and further y and x0 belong to diﬀerent components of Ω \ ∂B ˜γ,t.
If y ∈ ˜γ([0, t]) \ B ˜γ,t and y < γ([0, 1]), then by the construction of the curve ˜γ again, we
see that there is a line segment ℓγ(˜tl),γ(˜tu) ⊂ ˜γ([0, t]) such that y ∈ ℓγ(˜tl),γ(˜tu). Arguing as in
Case 1, we see that there is one end-point of ℓγ(˜tl),γ(˜tu), assuming that it is γ(˜tl), that belongs
to ˜γ([0, t]) \ B ˜γ,t and connects to y in the segment.
Since γ(˜tl) ∈ ˜γ([0, t]) \ B ˜γ,t and γ(˜tl) ∈ γ([0, 1]), we can conclude that y and γ(˜tl) belong
to the same component of Ω\ ∂B ˜γ,t, while x0 belongs to another component, as desired. (cid:3)

Theorem 3.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a domain satisfying the separation property. Then Ω is a John
domain if and only if there exists a positive constant CE such that for every separating ball
B ⊂ Ω, it holds that
(3.1)
for B−end EB.
Proof. It is quite standard to prove (3.1) assuming John condition (see [6, Theorem 2.1]).
For the converse implication we modify the ideas from [21, p. 18] and [6].

|EB| ≤ CE |B|

Let x ∈ Ω be a point and let γ : [0, 1] → Ω with γ(0) = x, γ(1) = x0 be a curve given
by the separation condition. From the previous proposition, We may assume that for each
Whitney cube Q the intersection Q ∩ γ has at most one component.

To prove that Ω is a John domain it suﬃces to show that

see [22, pp.385-386] or [27, pp.7-8].

ρ(γ(t)) = d(γ(t), ∂Ω) ≥ C diam (γ([0, t])),

Wx

If x ∈ B(x0, ρ(x0)), then one can take the line segment connecting x and x0, and the
conclusion is obvious. Suppose now x < B(x0, ρ(x0)). Consider the collection Wγ of all
Whitney squares that intersect γ. Since for each Whitney cube Q in Wγ, there is only one
component in Q ∩ γ by our reduction above, we can order them so that they form a chain
j=0 with x0 ∈ Q0 and Wx ∈ N depends on x. Notice that each cube is only numbered
{Q j}
once.
For each t ∈ [0, 1], let kt (0 ≤ kt ≤ Wx) be the smallest number such that γ(t) ∈ Qkt .
For the point γ(t), t ∈ [0, 1], the separation condition implies either γ([0, t]) ⊂ Bγ,t, Bγ,t :=
B(γ(t), Csρ(γ(t))), or every y ∈ γ([0, t]) and x0 lie in diﬀerent components of Ω \ ∂Bγ,t than
x0.
Case 1. Suppose that the former case happens. Then γ([0, t]) ⊂ Bγ,t, and we have for

each r < t that

ρ(γ(r)) ≤ Csρ(γ(t)) + ρ(γ(t)),

and for each Q j ∈ Wγ that contains γ(r),
(3.2)

Q j ⊂ B(γ(r), √nℓ(Q j)) ⊂ B(γ(r), ρ(γ(r))) ⊂ (2Cs + 1)B(γ(t), ρ(γt)) ⊂ 3Bγ,t.

This together with the deﬁnition of the chain {Q j}
hence,

, if Q j ∩
Notice that in this case we have γ([0, t]) ⊂ EBγ,t ∪ Bγ,t. For the cubes {Q j}
γ([0, t]) ∩ Bγ,t , ∅, then the same argument as in proving (3.2) gives that Q j ⊂ 3Bγ,t ⊂
EBγ,t ∪ (3 + 2√nCE)Bγ,t.
For each cube Q j that Q j ∩ γ([0, t]) ∩ Bγ,t = ∅, there is r ∈ [0, t] such that γ(r) ∈ Q j and
γ(r) ∈ EBγ,t. If Q j ⊂ EBγ,t, then we also have Q j ⊂ EBγ,t ∪ (3 + 2√nCE)Bγ,t.
It remains to consider the case Q j \ EBγ,t , ∅. Notice that now Q j ∩ Bγ,t , ∅. From
Lemma 3.2 and γ(r) ∈ Q j, we deduce that

Wx
j=kt

√nℓ(Q j) ≤ ρ(γ(r)) ≤ d(Q j, ∂Ω) + √nℓ(Q j) ≤ 5√nℓ(Q j).

This implies that B(γ(r), ℓ(Q j)) is compactly contained in Ω, further, since the center γ(r)
is in EBγ,t, we can conclude that at least half of B(γ(r), ℓ(Q j)) belongs to EBγ,t, and from the
assumption that

1
2|B(γ(r), ℓ(Q j))| ≤ |B(γ(r), ℓ(Q j)) ∩ EBγ,t| ≤ |EBγ,t| ≤ CE|Bγ,t|,

and therefore ℓ(Q j) ≤ (2CE)1/nCsρ(γ(t)). This and the fact Q j ∩ Bγ,t , ∅ give Q j ⊂
2√nCEBγ,t, and hence completes the proof of

Wx[j=kt

Q j ⊂ EBγ,t ∪ (3 + 2√nCE)Bγ,t.

Finally, by the non-overlap property of Whitney cubes, Lemma 3.2, we conclude that

The estimates (3.3) and (3.4) with Lemma 3.1 imply that for all t ∈ [0, 1]

In this and the next section, we provide the proof of the main result of the paper.

4 Korn inequalities (Kp) and (eKp) imply John condition
Theorem 4.1. Let Ω be a bounded domain of Rn, n ≥ 2. Let 1 < p < ∞. Suppose that for

Proof. Suppose that Ω satisﬁes the separation property w.r.t. x0 ∈ Ω. Let Q be the Whitney
cube such that x0 ∈ Q ⊂⊂ Ω.
By Theorem 3.1, to show that Ω is a John domain, it suﬃces to show that there exists an
absolute constant CE > 0 such that for each separating ball B, B = B(z, r) with z ∈ Ω, its
end EB has the property |EB| ≤ CE|B|.
If B ∩ Q , ∅, then by B ∩ ∂Ω , ∅ we see that r ≥ √nℓ(Q)/2. In this case, it holds that
|EB| ≤ |Ω| ≤ C(Ω, Q)|B|.
Suppose now that B ∩ Q = ∅. Let EB be the B-end. If |B| ≥ |Q|/(C p
K3n+2p), then it holds
that |EB| ≤ |Ω| ≤ C(Ω, Q, CK)|B|. Therefore we may assume that

|B| <

Then φ is a Lipschitz function that vanishes on B.

For each x = (x1, · · · , xn) ∈ Ω, let v = (v1, v2, 0, · · · , 0) with

v2(x1, · · · , xn) = (z1 − x1)φ(x1, · · · , xn),

The implication “(eK)p implies John” is proved similarly.

5 Korn inequality (bKp) implies John condition
In this section, we show that the Korn inequality (bKp) also implies John condition, and

therefore complete the proof of Theorem 1.1. This requires little more work than the other
two implications. For the proof we need the following lemma which is well-known for the
experts but it seems that there are no proofs published so far.
Lemma 5.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a domain satisfying the separation property with constant Cs
with respect to the center point x0. Let x ∈ Ω. Then Ω satisﬁes the separation property also
with respect to the center x.

Proof. We claim that if the point x0 qualiﬁes for a center in the separation property, then
every point in B(x0, ρ(x0)/1000) qualiﬁes for a center with constant 2Cs. This easily implies
that the set of all points qualifying as centers is open and also that its complement is open.
Therefore, by connectedness of Ω it suﬃces to prove this claim.

Take a point x ∈ B(x0, ρ(x0)/1000). For any point y ∈ Ω there exists a curve ˜γ joining x0
to y satisfying the condition in the deﬁnition of the separation condition. Denote by γ the
composition of ˜γ and line segment ℓx,x0 joining x and x0. After a reparametrization we have
γ(0) = y and γ(1) = x.

we have ρ(w) ≥ 1
condition.

Take a point w = γ(t) on the curve γ. If this point lies on the line segment ℓx,x0 then
2 ρ(x0) and, therefore, x, x0 ∈ B(w, 2Csρ(w)). This implies the required
If the point w lies on the curve ˜γ then we have w = ˜γ(t′) for some t′. Since ˜γ is the curve
given by the separation condition we have either ˜γ([0, t′]) ⊂ B(w, Csρ(w)) or every point in
˜γ([0, t′]) \ B(w, Csρ(w)) belongs to a diﬀerent component of Ω \ ∂B(w, Csρ(w)) than x0. In
the former case we have ˜γ([0, t′]) ⊂ B(w, 2Csρ(w)).
In the latter case, there is nothing to prove if x ∈ B(w, 2Csρ(w)). For the remaining
case, i.e., x < B(w, 2Csρ(w)), Let us argue by contradiction. Assume there exists y ∈
˜γ([0, t′]) \ B(w, 2Csρ(w)) belongs to the same component of Ω \ ∂B(w, 2Csρ(w)) as x. This
implies that x and y belong to a common component of Ω\ ∂B(w, Csρ(w)), and furthermore,

Korn inequality and John domain

15

x and y belong to a diﬀerent component than x0. Since the the line segment connecting x and
x0 is contained in Ω, there exists a point of the sphere ∂B(w, Csρ(w)) on this line segment.
Since x < B(w, 2Csρ(w)), we ﬁnd that

(5.1)

Csρ(w) ≤ |x − x0| < ρ(x0)/1000.

On the other hand, B(w, Csρ(w)) intersects ∂Ω and, thus, it holds ρ(x0) ≤ |x0−w|+Csρ(w).
Notice that now, B(w, 2Csρ(w)) ∩ B(x0, ρ(x0)/2) = ∅, since for each z ∈ B(x0, ρ(x0)/2),

This with (5.1) gives |x0 − w| > 999ρ(x0)/1000.
it holds

|z − w| ≥ |w − x0| − |x0 − z| > 999ρ(x0)/1000 − ρ(x0)/2 > 2ρ(x0)/5 > 2Csρ(w).

This is a contradiction with the fact that ∂B(w, Csρ(w)) separates x and x0. Therefore, there
is no such y, that is, each y ∈ ˜γ([0, t′]) \ B(w, 2Csρ(w)) belongs to a diﬀerent component of
Ω \ ∂B(w, 2Csρ(w)) than x. The proof is complete.

(cid:3)

With the help of above lemma, we are able to complete our proof.

kDvkLp(Ω) ≤ Cnkǫ(v)kLp(Ω) + kDvkLp(Q)o .

Theorem 5.1. Let Ω be a bounded domain of Rn, n ≥ 2. Let 1 < p < ∞ and Q ⊂⊂ Ω be a
closed cube. Suppose that for all v ∈ W1,p(Ω, Rn) it holds that
(bKp)
Then if Ω satisﬁes the separation property, Ω is a John domain.
Proof. Suppose that Ω satisﬁes the separation property w.r.t. x0 ∈ Ω. Then by the above
lemma, Ω satisﬁes the separation property w.r.t. xQ ∈ Q, where xQ is the center of Q.
By Theorem 3.1, to show Ω is a John domain, it suﬃces to show that there exists an
absolute constant CE > 0 such that for each separating ball B, B = B(z, r) with z ∈ Ω, its
end EB, if exists, then |EB| ≤ CE|B|.
If B ∩ Q , ∅, then by B ∩ ∂Ω , ∅ we see that r ≥ √nℓ(Q)/2. In this case, it holds that
|EB| ≤ |Ω| ≤ C(Ω, Q)|B|.
Suppose now B ∩ Q = ∅. Let EB be the B-end. If EB ⊂ 4B or |EB| ≤ |4B|, then the
conclusion is obvious. Otherwise, let φ and v be given as in (4.1) and (4.2), respectively.
Applying the Korn inequality (bKp) to v, we ﬁnd that
(bKp)

kDvkLp(Ω) ≤ CKnkǫ(v)kLp(Ω) + kDvkLp(Q)o ,

and can conclude from the construction of v that
