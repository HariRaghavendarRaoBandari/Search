Universality of Composition Operators and

Applications to Holomorphic Dynamics

Andreas Jung1

Abstract. By investigating which level of universality composition
operators Cf can have, where the symbol f is given by the restriction
of an entire function to suitable parts of the Fatou set of f , this work
combines the theory of dynamics of continuous linear operators on
spaces of holomorphic functions with the theory of non-linear complex
dynamics on the complex plane.

Key words: universality, composition operator, complex dynamics

Introduction

1
For topological spaces X, Y and a family {Tι : ι ∈ I} of continuous functions
Tι : X → Y , an element x ∈ X is called universal for {Tι : ι ∈ I} if the set
{Tι(x) : ι ∈ I} is dense in Y . In case that X is a topological vector space and
T : X → X is a continuous linear operator, a vector x ∈ X is called hypercyclic
for T if it is universal for the family {T n : n ∈ N}, i.e. if its orbit {T n(x) : n ∈ N}
is dense in X (where for sets X and functions F : X → X, F n := F ◦ . . . ◦ F
denotes the n-th iterate of F , that is F 0 := idX and F n := F ◦ F n−1 for n ∈ N).
We investigate which level of universality sequences (Cfn ) can have, where

Cf : H(D) → H(D), Cf (g) := g ◦ f,

denotes the composition operator with symbol f for open sets D ⊂ C and
holomorphic self-maps f of D. As usual, the space H(D) of complex-valued
holomorphic functions on D is endowed with the topology of locally uniform
convergence. The transform Cf is a continuous linear operator on the Fr´echet
space H(D) and we have (Cf )n = Cf n for all n ∈ N.
The ﬁrst work on universality of composition operators on general open subsets
of the complex plane is due to W. Luh in 1993 (see [15], Theorem on p. 161).
In case that all components of D are simply connected, he proved the existence
of a sequence (fn) of conformal self-maps of D and the existence of a function
g ∈ H(D) having the property that for each compact subset K of D with
connected complement the set {Cfn (g)|K : n ∈ N} is dense in the Banach space

(cid:0)A(K),(cid:107)r(cid:107)K
(cid:1), where A(K) denotes the space of complex-valued continuous
functions on D which are holomorphic on D◦, and (cid:107)r(cid:107)K is the uniform norm

on K, i.e.

(cid:107)h(cid:107)K := max
z∈K

|h(z)|, h ∈ A(K).

In 1995, L. Bernal-Gonz´alez and A. Montes-Rodr´ıguez were the ﬁrst to char-
acterize universality of a sequence of composition operators (Cfn ) for a given
sequence (fn) of conformal self-maps of D (cf. [6]). In order to state their main
result, we introduce the following deﬁnition, which was coined by them:
Deﬁnition 1.1. A sequence (fn) of holomorphic self-maps of a domain Ω ⊂ C
is called a run-away sequence if for each compact subset K of Ω there exists an
N ∈ N such that fN (K) ∩ K = ∅.
The main result of Bernal and Montes reads as follows (see [6], Theorem 3.6):
Theorem 1.2. (Bernal, Montes, 1995) Let Ω ⊂ C be a domain and let (fn) be
a sequence of conformal self-maps of Ω.

i) If Ω is not conformally equivalent to C\{0}, the sequence of composition
operators (Cfn ) is universal if and only if (fn) is a run-away sequence. In
case that one of these conditions holds, the set of universal functions for
(Cfn) is comeager in H(Ω).
ii) There exists a function g ∈ H(Ω) having the property that for each compact
subset K of Ω with connected complement the set {Cfn (g)|K : n ∈ N} is
dense in A(K) if and only if (fn) is a run-away sequence.
In case of
existence, the set of such functions is comeager in H(Ω).

A subset of a Baire space is comeager if it contains a dense Gδ-set. Bernal and
Montes showed that the statement in i) does not hold for Ω = C\{0} (see [6],
Remark on p. 55). In 2009, K.-G. Grosse-Erdmann and R. Mortini characterized
universality of composition operators without the assumption of conformality
of the corresponding symbols – they only required (fn) to be a sequence of
holomorphic self-maps of Ω (cf. [12]). Their main result concerning the case of
iteration of one holomorphic function is the following (cf. [12], Theorem 3.21(a)):
Theorem 1.3. (Grosse-Erdmann, Mortini, 2009) Let Ω ⊂ C be a simply con-
nected domain and let f be a holomorphic self-map of Ω. Then Cf is hypercyclic
if and only if (f n) is a run-away sequence and f is injective.

If one of the two conditions in Theorem 1.3 holds, the set of hypercyclic functions
for Cf is comeager in H(Ω). It is easy to see that injectivity of the symbol is
necessary in order to obtain hypercyclicity of the corresponding composition
Indeed, if f is not injective, we can choose points z1, z2 ∈ Ω with
operator.
z1 (cid:54)= z2 and f (z1) = f (z2). Then, for g ∈ H(Ω), only functions h ∈ H(Ω) with
h(z1) = h(z2) can be pointwise limit functions of a subsequence of (g ◦ f n).
Returning to the general situation of an open set D ⊂ C and a holomorphic
self-map f of D, we recall that a function g ∈ H(D) is called hypercyclic for Cf
if the set {g ◦ f n : n ∈ N} is dense in H(D). This is equivalent to the fact that
for each h ∈ H(D) there exists a strictly increasing sequence (nk) in N such that
(g ◦ f nk ) converges to h locally uniformly on D, i.e. each function in H(D) can
be approximated locally uniformly on D via subsequences of (g ◦ f n). For many
situations which will occur in this work, it is useful to modify this deﬁnition of
hypercyclicity with regard to the following two aspects:

2

• We want to obtain hypercyclic functions for Cf which are deﬁned (and

holomorphic) on larger open sets than D.

• For hypercyclic functions g for Cf and suitable sets M ⊂ D, we want
to approximate all elements of certain subclasses of the space C(M ) of
continuous functions on M via subsequences of (g ◦ f n|M ), i.e. we want
to approximate classes of functions which are larger than H(D) on sets
which are smaller than D.

(Kn) of M , and the family of seminorms {(cid:107)r(cid:107)Kn : n ∈ N} turns C(M ) into

If M ⊂ D is locally compact and σ-compact, there exists a compact exhaustion

a Fr´echet space. The induced topology does not depend on the choice of the
sets Kn. In the following, the space C(M ) will always be endowed with this
topology. Special cases are the spaces A(K) if M = K is compact and H(U ) if
M = U is open. In the latter case, a basis of the above topology is given by

(cid:8)Vε,L,U (g) : ε > 0, L ⊂ U compact, g ∈ H(U )(cid:9),

where Vε,L,U (g) := {h ∈ H(U ) : (cid:107)h − g(cid:107)L < ε}. For fn, f ∈ C(M ), n ∈ N,
the sequence (fn) converges to f in the Fr´echet space C(M ) if and only if (fn)
converges to f locally uniformly on M .

In order to comply with the two above-mentioned modiﬁcations, we now ﬁx a
domain Ω ⊂ C with Ω ⊃ D and we introduce the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 1.4. Let M ⊂ D be locally compact and σ-compact and let F ⊂
C(M ) be a family of functions in the Fr´echet space C(M ). A function g ∈ H(Ω)
is called Ω-F-universal for Cf if

F ⊂ {g ◦ f n|M : n ∈ N}C(M )

.

The composition operator Cf is called Ω-F-universal if there exists an Ω-F-
universal function for Cf .
If it is clear from the context which domain Ω is
considered, Ω-F-universality will brieﬂy be referred to as F-universality.
In case of {g ◦ f n|M : n ∈ N} ⊂ F, the condition in Deﬁnition 1.4 is equivalent
to the fact that the set {g ◦ f n|M : n ∈ N} is dense in F. For Ω = D, a function
g ∈ H(D) is hypercyclic for Cf if and only if it is H(D)-universal for Cf .
In general, we are mainly interested in the following question: For open subsets
U of D (compact subsets K of D), we want to ﬁnd conditions on f and U (on K)
such that the composition operator Cf is H(U )-universal (A(K)-universal). In
Section 2, we will formulate and prove several statements of this kind. The main
motivation of this work consists in applying such general universality statements
to situations which naturally occur in the theory of complex dynamics, where
the long-time behaviour of certain discrete topological dynamical systems is
investigated. The systems which are studied are given by the iteration of a
transcendental entire function or a rational function. To simplify matters, we
will only consider entire functions in this work – however, all following results

3

also hold for rational functions (cf. [13]). The local behaviour of the considered
function near ﬁxed points plays an important role in the study of the long-
time behaviour of the corresponding dynamical system. For a complex-valued
function g which is holomorphic near a point z0 ∈ C with g(z0) = z0, the
multiplier of g at z0 is deﬁned as λ := g(cid:48)(z0), and the ﬁxed point z0 is called
superattracting, attracting, indiﬀerent or repelling if λ = 0, 0 < |λ| < 1, |λ| = 1
or |λ| > 1, respectively.
Indiﬀerent ﬁxed points with λ = 1 are also called
neutral.
We denote by C∞ := C ∪ {∞} the extended complex plane and we endow this
set with the chordal metric χ. For a topological space X and a metric space Y ,
a family F ⊂ C(X, Y ) is called normal if each sequence in F has a subsequence
which converges uniformly on all compact subsets of X to a function in the space
C(X, Y ) of continuous functions from X to Y . If X is locally compact and has
a compact exhaustion, normality is a local property, i.e. a family F ⊂ C(X, Y )
is normal if and only if for each point x ∈ X there exists a neighbourhood W
2.1.2, in case that X is a domain in C).
For the rest of this section, we now ﬁx an entire function f which is not a
polynomial of degree 0 or 1. The following deﬁnition is crucial in the theory of
complex dynamics:
Deﬁnition 1.5. The Fatou set Ff of f is deﬁned as the set of all points z ∈ C
for which there exists a neighbourhood W of z such that {f n|W : n ∈ N} is a
normal family in C(W, C∞). The complement of Ff is called the Julia set of f
and it is denoted by Jf .

of x such that(cid:8)f|W : f ∈ F(cid:9) is a normal family in C(W, Y ) (cf. [20], Theorem

By deﬁnition, Ff is an open set. Thus, Jf is closed. Due to the above consider-
ations, {f n|Ff : n ∈ N} is a normal family in C(Ff , C∞). It is well-known that
the Julia set of f is completely invariant under f (see [21] p. 299 and Theorem
1.7). Hence, the same is also true for the Fatou set of f . Moreover, Jf is a
perfect set, i.e. Jf has no isolated points (see [21], Theorem 1.4), and we have
Ff n = Ff as well as Jf n = Jf for all n ∈ N (see [21], p. 299). (Super-)attracting
ﬁxed points of f are contained in the Fatou set of f , whereas repelling and
neutral ﬁxed points of f belong to the Julia set of f .

A reason for splitting the complex plane into the two disjoint subsets Ff and
Jf is the following: It is well-known that the sequence of iterates (f n) behaves
quite “chaotically” on Jf whereas, on the other hand, the behaviour of (f n) on
Ff is quite “nice” and well-understood. The “chaotic” behaviour of (f n) on Jf
can be described as follows: For each point z ∈ Jf and each arbitrarily small
open neighbourhood V of z, we have

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)C∞\ (cid:91)

n∈N

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 2.

f n(V )

Thus, every value in the extended complex plane, with at most two exceptions,
is assumed on V under the iteration of f . This result is a direct application

4

of Montel’s theorem which states that a family of meromorphic functions on a
domain G ⊂ C omitting three ﬁxed values in C∞ is a normal family in C(G, C∞)
(cf. [7], Theorem I.3.2).

In order to point out that the sequence of iterates (f n) behaves “nicely” on Ff ,
we now consider a component G of Ff . For each n ∈ N, the continuity of f n
and the invariance of Ff under f imply that f n(G) is a connected subset of
Ff . Hence, there exists a component Gn of Ff with f n(G) ⊂ Gn. Using the
notation G0 := G, we call G preperiodic if there exist integers p > m ≥ 0 with
Gp = Gm. If G is preperiodic and if in particular m = 0, we have f p(G) ⊂ G
and G is called periodic with period p. Finally, if G is periodic with period 1, we
have f (G) ⊂ G and we call G invariant. The following theorem gives a complete
description of the behaviour of the sequence of iterates (f n) on components of
the Fatou set of f . It is mainly due to P. Fatou in 1919 and H. Cremer in 1932
(cf. [5], p. 163).

Theorem 1.6. (Classiﬁcation Theorem of Fatou Components) Let G be an
invariant component of Ff . Then G is of exactly one of the following types:

• G contains a superattracting ﬁxed point z0 of f and f n|G → z0 (B¨ottcher

domain),

• G contains an attracting ﬁxed point z0 of f and f n|G → z0 (Schr¨oder

domain),

• ∂G contains a neutral ﬁxed point z0 of f and f n|G → z0 (Leau domain),
• f is conjugated on G to an irrational rotation on D := {z ∈ C : |z| < 1}

(Siegel disc),

• f is transcendental entire and f n|G → ∞ (Baker domain).

(Pre-)periodic components of Ff are classiﬁed in exactly the same way. A
component of Ff which is not preperiodic is called a wandering domain. It is
well-known that polynomials do not have any wandering domains (see [24], The-
orem 1). In view of the classiﬁcation theorem, there exist only a few possibilities
of how the iterates of f can behave on the Fatou set of f . For this reason, we
stated above that the behaviour of (f n) on Ff is “nice” and well-understood.

The main motivation of this work is the following: Composing the iterates from
the left with one other suitable holomorphic function, we will see that this nice
behaviour of the sequence of iterates on the Fatou set can “change dramatically”
such that it becomes quite similarly chaotic as on the Julia set! The general
aim of this work is to study the long-time behaviour of such modiﬁed sequences
on the Fatou set. More precisely, this means that we will prove H(U )- and
A(K)-universality of the composition operator Cf for suitable open subsets U
of Ff and suitable compact subsets K of Ff . This will be the “dramatic change
of behaviour” of the sequence of iterates (f n) composed with some universal
function g for Cf – because, in this situation, the family of compositions {g◦f n :
n ∈ N} will be dense in some space of holomorphic functions, which means that
the sequence of compositions (g ◦ f n) will be kind of “maximally divergent”.

5

But this stands in sharp contrast to the fact that the sequence of iterates (f n)
itself converges, behaves like a rotation or is wandering on all components of
Ff , as stated in the classiﬁcation theorem.
Moreover, if U ⊂ Ff is a domain such that there exist a compact set K ⊂
U which has an accumulation point in U and a function g which is A(K)-
universal for Cf , the family of compositions {g ◦ f n|U : n ∈ N} is not normal in
C(U, C∞) any more (by Mergelyan’s theorem, this is in particular fulﬁlled if Cf
is H(U )-universal). Indeed, choosing some h ∈ A(K) which can not be extended
holomorphically to U , the denseness of {g ◦ f n|K : n ∈ N} in A(K) yields a
sequence (nj) in N with uniform convergence g ◦ f nj → h on K. Assuming that
the family {g ◦ f n|U : n ∈ N} is normal in C(U, C∞), the Vitali-Porter theorem
would imply the existence of a function ψ ∈ H(U ) ∪ {∞} with locally uniform
convergence g ◦ f nj → ψ on U , and we would obtain ψ|K = h, a contradiction.

2 General Universality Statements for Compo-

sition Operators with Holomorphic Symbol

Throughout this section, we ﬁx an open set D ⊂ C, a domain Ω ⊂ C with
Ω ⊃ D and a holomorphic function f : D → D. As already mentioned in
the introduction, our aim will be the following: For open subsets U of D and
compact subsets K of D, we want to ﬁnd conditions on f and U (and on K,
respectively) such that the composition operator Cf is H(U )-universal (A(K)-
universal).

As seen above, topological properties of sets play an important role for obtain-
ing universality of a given sequence of composition operators, i.e. the above-
mentioned theorems of Luh, Bernal and Montes as well as Grosse-Erdmann and
Mortini hold for sets which have connected complement. For a set M ⊂ C, we
call a component H of C∞\M with ∞ /∈ H a hole of M . Moreover, we denote

K(M )
K0(M )
U(M )
U0(M )

:= {K ⊂ M : K compact, K (cid:54)= ∅} ,
:= {K ∈ K(M ) : K has no holes} ,
:= {U ⊂ M : U open in C, U (cid:54)= ∅} ,
:= {U ∈ U(M ) : U has no holes} .

We remark that a subset M of the complex plane has no holes if and only if
C∞\M is connected. In this work, we will often use the fact that for an open set
U ⊂ C and an injective holomorphic function ϕ : U → C the image ϕ(U ) has the
same number of holes as U . An analogous statement holds if K ⊂ C is compact
and ϕ is injective and holomorphic on an open neighbourhood of K, i.e. then K
and ϕ(K) have the same number of holes (see [18], p. 276 and cf. [12], p. 360).
Whenever we use one of these statements, we call this the invariance of the
number of holes. Sometimes, we want to “ﬁll up” holes of compact sets relative
to a given open superset. In order to specify what this means, we denote for

6

the holomorphically convex hull of K with respect to U , and we say that K is

convex hull of K (cf. [18], p. 266).

(cf. [18], p. 263f.). Thus, K is U -convex if and only if each hole of K contains a

U ∈ U(C) and K ∈ K(U ) by (cid:98)KU := {z ∈ U : |f (z)| ≤ ||f||K for all f ∈ H(U )}
U -convex if K = (cid:98)KU . By deﬁnition, (cid:98)KU is U -convex. It is well-known that the
compact set (cid:98)KU is the union of K with all holes of K which are contained in U
point in C\U . If, in particular, U = C, we write (cid:98)K := (cid:98)KC for the polynomially
(dist(f n(r), ∂∞Ω))n∈N converges to 0 locally uniformly on U ) and injectivity of

In view of Theorem 1.3, the following deﬁnition is now reasonable:
Deﬁnition 2.1. We denote by U0(D, Ω, f ) the set of all sets U ∈ U0(D) for
which we have locally uniform convergence f n|U → ∂∞Ω (i.e. the sequence

each iterate f n on U .
Here, ∂∞ denotes the boundary of subsets of C with respect to (C∞, χ). The
ﬁrst condition in Deﬁnition 2.1 corresponds to the run-away property of the
sequence of iterates (f n) as deﬁned by Bernal and Montes (see Deﬁnition 1.1)
and as stated in Theorem 1.3. At ﬁrst view, the second condition seems to
be stronger than the condition of injectivity of the symbol of the composition
operator in Grosse-Erdmann’s and Mortini’s theorem. However, in the situation
of Theorem 1.3, the symbol is a self-map of the considered domain so that its
injectivity implies the injectivity of all of its iterates, which is crucial for the
proof of Theorem 1.3.

Now, we can state and prove the following universality result, which will be the
basis for several further universality statements. The proof will run along the
lines of the proof of Theorem 3.2, (c)=⇒(a), in [12].
Theorem 2.2. Let U ∈ U0(D, Ω, f ). Then the set of all functions in H(Ω)
which are H(U )-universal for Cf is a comeager set in H(Ω).
Proof: For n ∈ N, we consider the composition operator

Cf n,U : H(Ω) → H(U ), Cf n,U (g) := g ◦ f n|U .

According to the universality criterion, it suﬃces to show that the sequence
(Cf n,U ) is topologically transitive (cf. [11], Theorem 1). In order to do so, let
∅ (cid:54)= V ⊂ H(Ω) and ∅ (cid:54)= W ⊂ H(U ) be open. For g ∈ V, there exist ε1 > 0 and
K1 ∈ K(Ω) such that Vε1,K1,Ω(g) ⊂ V. Deﬁning
K := (cid:91)(K1)Ω,
L :=(cid:99)L1,

we obtain that K is Ω-convex with Vε1,K,Ω(g) = Vε1,K1,Ω,(g) ⊂ V. For h ∈ W,
there exist ε2 > 0 and L1 ∈ K(U ) with Vε2,L1,U (h) ⊂ W. Considering the
polynomially convex hull

we have Vε2,L,U (h) = Vε2,L1,U (h) ⊂ W. As U has no holes, it follows that
L ∈ K0(U ). Putting ε := min(ε1, ε2) > 0, we obtain

Vε,K,Ω(g) ⊂ Vε1,K,Ω(g) ⊂ V

and

Vε,L,U (h) ⊂ Vε2,L,U (h) ⊂ W.

7

Now, let δ := dist(K, ∂∞Ω) > 0. Because of U ∈ U0(D, Ω, f ), we obtain
the uniform convergence f n|L → ∂∞Ω. Thus, there exists an N ∈ N with
dist(f N (z), ∂∞Ω) < δ for all z ∈ L, which implies K ∩ f N (L) = ∅. Accord-
ing to U ∈ U0(D, Ω, f ), the restriction f N|U is injective. Hence, as L has no
holes, the invariance of the number of holes implies that f N (L) has no holes
as well. Therefore, the disjoint union of the compact set K with the compact
set f N (L) does not produce a new hole so that the Ω-convexity of K implies
that K ∪ f N (L) is Ω-convex again. Thus, we can choose from each hole of
K ∪ f N (L) a point which lies in C\Ω. Let A be the union of these points and let
B := A ∪ {∞}. Then we have B ⊂ C∞\Ω ⊂ C∞\(K ∪ f N (L)) and B ∩ C (cid:54)= ∅
for all components C of C∞\(K ∪ f N (L)). We now consider the function

ϕ : K ∪ f N (L) → C, ϕ(z) :=

(cid:26) g(z),
h(cid:0)(f N|U )−1(z)(cid:1),

if z ∈ K
if z ∈ f N (L)

.

As the disjoint sets K and f N (L) are compact with K ⊂ Ω and f N (L) ⊂ f N (U )
and since we have g ∈ H(Ω) as well as h ∈ H(U ), we see that ϕ can be extended
holomorphically to an open neighbourhood of K ∪ f N (L). Hence, Runge’s
theorem yields a rational function R having poles only in B ⊂ C∞\Ω such that
(cid:107)ϕ−R(cid:107)K∪f N (L) < ε. The restriction R|Ω is holomorphic on Ω, and due to ϕ = g
on K we obtain

(cid:107)g − R(cid:107)K = (cid:107)ϕ − R(cid:107)K ≤ (cid:107)ϕ − R(cid:107)K∪f N (L) < ε

and thus R|Ω ∈ Vε,K,Ω(g) ⊂ V. Because of ϕ = h ◦ (f N|U )−1 on f N (L), we
further obtain

(cid:13)(cid:13)h − Cf N ,U (R|Ω)(cid:13)(cid:13)L = (cid:13)(cid:13)h − R ◦ f N(cid:13)(cid:13)L =(cid:13)(cid:13)h ◦ (f N|U )−1 − R(cid:13)(cid:13)f N (L)

= (cid:107)ϕ − R(cid:107)f N (L) ≤ (cid:107)ϕ − R(cid:107)K∪f N (L) < ε

and thus Cf N ,U (R|Ω) ∈ Vε,L,U (h) ⊂ W. Altogether, it follows that Cf N ,U (R|Ω)
is contained in the intersection Cf N ,U (V)∩W so that the topological transitivity
(cid:3)
of the sequence (Cf n,U ) is shown.

The diﬀerence between the above theorem and the result of Grosse-Erdmann
and Mortini (Theorem 1.3) is the following: Applying Theorem 2.2, we obtain
H(U )-universal functions for Cf which are actually deﬁned and holomorphic on
the “large” domain Ω – and not only on the set U itself which is contained in
the open set D on which the symbol f is deﬁned. Now, it is our aim to extend
the statement of Theorem 2.2 in the following way: We want to ﬁnd conditions
such that the composition operator Cf is H(U )-universal for all sets U ∈ U0(D).
This intention originates from the above-mentioned second result of Bernal and
Montes (Theorem 1.2 ii)). In view of Theorem 2.2, it is natural to require the
existence of a sequence in U0(D, Ω, f ), which fulﬁls the following property in D:
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let V ∈ U(C). A sequence (Mn) of subsets of V is called
K0(V )-exhausting if for each set L ∈ K0(V ) there exists an N ∈ N with L ⊂ M◦
N .

8

Each open set V ⊂ C has a K0(V )-exhausting sequence in U0(V ).
Indeed,
Bernal and Montes have shown that each domain G ⊂ C has a K0(G)-exhausting
sequence in K0(G) (see [6], Lemma 2.9). Considering their proof of this state-
ment, one can verify that it also holds for arbitrary open subsets of the complex
plane. Hence, there exists a K0(V )-exhausting sequence (Kn) in K0(V ). As we
can ﬁnd for each n ∈ N a set Un ∈ U0(V ) with Un ⊃ Kn (see e.g. [10], Satz
2.2.4 and the ﬁrst part of its proof), we obtain that (Un) is a K0(V )-exhausting
sequence in U0(V ).
Corollary 2.4. Let there exist a K0(D)-exhausting sequence in U0(D, Ω, f ).
Then the set of all functions in H(Ω) which are H(U )-universal for Cf for all
U ∈ U0(D) is a comeager set in H(Ω).
Proof: Let (Um) be a K0(D)-exhausting sequence in U0(D, Ω, f ). Moreover,
for m ∈ N, let Gm be the set of all functions in H(Ω) which are H(Um)-universal
for Cf . Due to Theorem 2.2, each set Gm is comeager in H(Ω) so that the same
m∈N Gm. Let H be the set
of all functions in H(Ω) which are H(U )-universal for Cf for all U ∈ U0(D).
We now show the inclusion G ⊂ H, which will complete the proof. For this
purpose, let g ∈ G and U ∈ U0(D). As we have to show the denseness of
ε > 0. Because of U ∈ U0(D) ⊂ U0(C), we have (cid:98)K ∈ K0(U ) ⊂ K0(D). Runge’s
the set {g ◦ f n|U : n ∈ N} in H(U ), let moreover h ∈ H(U ), K ∈ K(U ) and
theorem implies the existence of a polynomial P with (cid:107)P − h(cid:107)(cid:98)K < ε/2. As (Um)
is K0(D)-exhausting, there exists an M ∈ N with (cid:98)K ⊂ UM . Due to g ∈ G ⊂ GM
and P|UM ∈ H(UM ), we obtain an N ∈ N with (cid:13)(cid:13)g ◦ f N|UM − P(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:98)K < ε/2.

is also true for the countable intersection G := (cid:84)

Altogether, it follows

(cid:13)(cid:13)g ◦ f N|U − h(cid:13)(cid:13)K ≤(cid:13)(cid:13)g ◦ f N|UM − P(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:98)K + (cid:107)P − h(cid:107)(cid:98)K <

= ε.

Thus, we have shown that {g ◦ f n|U : n ∈ N} is dense in H(U ), which means
that g is H(U )-universal for Cf . Therefore, we obtain g ∈ H so that G ⊂ H is
(cid:3)
shown.

In particular, the assumptions of Corollary 2.4 are fulﬁlled if f is injective and
if f n|D → ∂∞Ω locally uniformly. Thus, we obtain:
Corollary 2.5. Let f be injective and let f n → ∂∞Ω locally uniformly on D.
Then the set of all functions in H(Ω) which are H(U )-universal for Cf for all
U ∈ U0(D) is a comeager set in H(Ω).
In the special case that D has no holes, we obtain the following result:
Corollary 2.6. Let D ∈ U0(C), let f be injective and let f n → ∂∞Ω locally
uniformly on D. Then the set of all functions in H(Ω) which are H(D)-universal
for Cf is a comeager set in H(Ω).

Similarly to Deﬁnition 2.1, the following deﬁnition is reasonable in case of ﬁnite
subsets of D:

9

Deﬁnition 2.7. We denote by E(D, Ω, f ) the set of all ﬁnite subsets E of D
for which we have convergence f n|E → ∂∞Ω and injectivity of each iterate f n
on E.

The same approach as in the proof of Theorem 2.2 now yields the following
result:
Corollary 2.8. Let E ∈ E(D, Ω, f ). Then the set of all functions in H(Ω)
which are C(E)-universal for Cf is a comeager set in H(Ω).

3 Applications: Local Theory

In this section, we want to state some ﬁrst applications of the general univer-
sality results of the previous section to the theory of complex dynamics. These
applications will all be of local nature, meaning that we will prove universality
of composition operators with locally deﬁned symbols which are holomorphic
near a ﬁxed point. In view of the classiﬁcation theorem of Fatou components,
we will consider attracting, neutral and superattracting ﬁxed points of the sym-
bols – nevertheless, the results in this section do not depend on results of the
Fatou-Julia theory, i.e. here we consider symbols f which only need to be deﬁned
locally near a point z0 ∈ C with f (z0) = z0.

3.1 Attracting Fixed Points
Let z0 be an attracting ﬁxed point of f , i.e. for λ := f(cid:48)(z0) we have 0 < |λ| < 1.
The main consideration we need now is the concept of conformal conjugation.
According to G. Kœnigs’ linearization theorem, there exist open neighbour-
hoods U of z0 and V of 0 as well as a conformal map ϕ : U → V which con-
jugates the map f|U : U → U to the linear function F : V → V, F (w) := λw,
i.e.

ϕ ◦ f n = F n ◦ ϕ = λn · ϕ

holds on U for all n ∈ N (see e.g. [7], Theorem II.2.1). In particular, we obtain
ϕ(z0) = 0 and hence locally uniform convergence f n → z0 on U .
Theorem 3.1. In the above situation, the set of all functions in H(C\{z0})
which are H(W )-universal for Cf for all W ∈ U0(U\{z0}) is a comeager set in
H(C\{z0}).
Proof: We consider the domain Ω := C\{z0} and the open set D := U\{z0} ⊂
Ω. As F, ϕ and ϕ−1 are injective, the same is also true for f|U = ϕ−1 ◦ F ◦ ϕ.
Hence, the restriction f|D : D → D is injective. Due to the locally uniform
convergence f n|D → z0 ∈ ∂∞Ω, the assertion follows from Corollary 2.5.
(cid:3)
As the open set U\{z0} has a hole (namely {z0}), one can show that there does
not exist a function in H(U\{z0}) which is H(U\{z0})-universal for Cf (cf. the
Remark in [6] on p. 55 and observe that f|U\{z0} is conjugated to the linear
function w (cid:55)→ λw on V \{0}).

10

3.2 Neutral Fixed Points
Let z0 be a neutral ﬁxed point of f , i.e. we have f(cid:48)(z0) = 1, and let f not be
the identity map. Putting

m := min{n ∈ N : f (n+1)(z0) (cid:54)= 0},

an application of the Leau-Fatou ﬂower theorem implies the existence of m
attracting petals P1, . . . , Pm for f , which are pairwise disjoint simply connected
domains in C with f (Pk) ⊂ Pk, z0 ∈ ∂Pk and f n|Pk → z0 uniformly, such
that for each k ∈ {1, . . . , m}, there exists a simply connected domain Vk ⊂ C
containing a right half-plane as well as a conformal map ϕk : Pk → Vk which
conjugates f|Pk to the translation w (cid:55)→ w + 1 on Vk, i.e. the equation

ϕk ◦ f n = ϕk + n

ing P :=(cid:83)m

holds on Pk for all integers n ∈ N (see e.g.[16], Theorems 10.5 and 10.7). Deﬁn-
k=1 Pk to be the union of all attracting petals, the following univer-

sality result holds:
Theorem 3.2. In the above situation, the set of all functions in H(C\{z0})
which are H(P )-universal for Cf is a comeager set in H(C\{z0}).
Proof: We consider the domain Ω := C\{z0} and the open set D := P ∈ U0(Ω).
First, we show that f|D : D → D is injective. To this end, let z, w ∈ D with
f (z) = f (w). Then there exist k, l ∈ {1, . . . , m} with z ∈ Pk and w ∈ Pl, and
the invariance of Pk and Pl under f implies f (z) ∈ Pk ∩ Pl. As Pk and Pl are
disjoint, we obtain k = l so that the injectivity of f|Pk = ϕ−1
k ◦ (ϕk + 1) yields
z = w. Due to the uniform convergence f n|D → z0 ∈ ∂∞Ω, the assertion follows
(cid:3)
from Corollary 2.6.

3.3 Superattracting Fixed Points
Let z0 be a superattracting ﬁxed point of f , i.e. we have f(cid:48)(z0) = 0, and let f
not be constant. Then, for p := min{n ∈ N : f (n)(z0) (cid:54)= 0}, we have p ≥ 2.
Again, the concept of conformal conjugation will be the main consideration now.
Due to B¨ottcher’s theorem, there exist open neighbourhoods U of z0 and V of
0 as well as a conformal map ϕ : U → V which conjugates f|U : U → U to the
p-th monomial Q on V , i.e.

ϕ(f n(z)) = Qn(ϕ(z)) = (ϕ(z))pn

holds for all z ∈ U and for all n ∈ N (see e.g. [7], Theorem II.4.1). Without
loss of generality, we may assume V ⊂ D so that the equality ϕ(z0) = ϕ(z0)p
implies ϕ(z0) = 0. Thus, analogously to the considerations before Theorem 3.1,
we obtain locally uniform convergence f n → z0 on U .
Similarly to the previous two subsections, it is now our aim to formulate and
prove a universality result for the composition operator Cf which holds locally

11

points is the following: As we have f (z) = ϕ−1(cid:0)(ϕ(z))p(cid:1) for all z ∈ U , we see

near z0. The problem compared to the situations of attracting or neutral ﬁxed

that the symbol f now is not injective on U . Hence, we cannot apply Corollaries
2.5 or 2.6 for proving H(W )-universality of Cf for suitable sets W ∈ U0(U\{z0}).
However, for n ∈ N, the pn-th monomial is injective on each angular sector of
the complex plane with arc length smaller than 2π/pn. In view of Theorem 2.2
and the considerations after Deﬁnition 2.1, we need injectivity of all iterates
of f in order to obtain universality of Cf . Because of 2π/pn → 0 and due
to the above conjugation, this means that for sets M ⊂ U\{z0} and families
F ⊂ C(M ), we only have a chance of obtaining F-universality of Cf if M has
empty interior (cf. the considerations after Theorem 3.5). It will be our aim to
prove that Cf is A(K)-universal for suitable compact subsets K of U\{z0} with
K◦ = ∅. As compensation for only considering such “small” subsets, we want
to obtain “many” of them. In order to specify what this means, we consider
for δ > 0 with Uδ[0] := {z ∈ C : |z| ≤ δ} ⊂ V the set Bδ := ϕ−1(Uδ[0]),
which is a compact neighbourhood of z0 that is contained in U . Then we have
ϕ(B◦

δ ) = ϕ(Bδ)◦ = Uδ(0) := {z ∈ C : |z| < δ} so that

ϕ|B◦

δ \{z0} : B◦

δ\{z0} → Uδ(0)\{0}

δ\{z0}) ⊂ B◦

space (cid:0)K(Bδ), dK(Bδ)

(cid:1) (see e.g. [8], p.66f.). In the following, we want to show

δ\{z0}. Endowing
is a conformal map. In particular, we obtain f (B◦
the set K(Bδ) with the Hausdorﬀ distance dK(Bδ), we obtain the complete metric
that Cf is A(K)-universal for comeager many K ∈ K(Bδ). The starting point
is the following universality result, which holds for ﬁnite sets:
δ\{z0} be a ﬁnite set such that all iterates f n are
Corollary 3.3. Let E ⊂ B◦
injective on E. Then the set of all functions in H(C\{z0}) which are C(E)-
universal for Cf is a comeager set in H(C\{z0}).
Proof: We consider the domain Ω := C\{z0} and the open set D := B◦
δ\{z0} ⊂
Ω. Due to the injectivity of all iterates f n|E and the convergence f n|E → z0 ∈
∂∞Ω, we obtain E ∈ E(D, Ω, f ) so that the assertion now follows from Corollary
(cid:3)
2.8.

In order to extend the universality statement of Corollary 3.3 to comeager many
δ\{z0}) ∩ (Q + iQ) and we
compact subsets of B◦
introduce the countable set

δ\{z0}, we denote Aδ := (B◦

(cid:1).

(cid:1) and K(B◦

Eδ := {E ⊂ Aδ : E (cid:54)= ∅, E ﬁnite, f n|E injective for all n ∈ N} .

Lemma 3.4. Eδ is dense in(cid:0)K(Bδ), dK(Bδ)
in(cid:0)K(Bδ), dK(Bδ)
obtain(cid:8)L ∈ K(Bδ) : dK(Bδ)(K, L) < δ(cid:9) ⊂ K(B◦

Proof: The proof of the ﬁrst statement is rather technical – therefore, we
refer to Lemma 3.3.2 and Corollary 3.3.3 in [13]. In order to prove the second
statement, let K ∈ K(B◦
δ\{z0}). Putting δ := dist({z0} ∪ ∂Bδ, K) > 0, we
δ\{z0}). Indeed, let L ∈ K(Bδ)

δ\{z0}) is open and dense

12

with dK(Bδ)(K, L) < δ. Assuming that there exists a point(cid:101)z ∈ L∩ ({z0}∪ ∂Bδ),

we would obtain

dK(Bδ)(K, L) ≥ max
z∈L

dist(z, K) ≥ dist((cid:101)z, K) ≥ dist({z0} ∪ ∂Bδ, K) = δ,

a contradiction. Thus, we have L∩({z0}∪∂Bδ) = ∅ and hence L ∈ K(B◦
Due to K(B◦

δ\{z0}) in
(cid:3)

Now, we can extend the statement of Corollary 3.3 in the following way:
Theorem 3.5. For each δ > 0 with Uδ[0] ⊂ V, comeager many functions in
H(C\{z0}) are C(K)-universal for Cf for comeager many K ∈ K(Bδ).
Proof: The proof will run similarly to the proof of Lemma 2 in [17].

i) For g ∈ H(C\{z0}), we deﬁne

Kg :=

K ∈ K(B◦

(cid:111)
δ\{z0}) : {g ◦ f n|K : n ∈ N} dense in C(K)

.

Denoting by P the set of all complex-valued polynomials in two real vari-
ables with Gaussian rational coeﬃcients, the complex Stone-Weierstrass
theorem implies that the set {p|L : p ∈ P} is dense in C(L) for each
L ∈ K(C). Hence, we obtain

Kg =

K ∈ K(B◦

δ\{z0}) : (cid:107)g ◦ f n|K − p(cid:107)K <

.

ii) Let g ∈ H(C\{z0}), p ∈ P and n ∈ N be ﬁxed. We show that the function

ψ : K(B◦

δ\{z0}) → [0,∞), ψ(K) := (cid:107)g ◦ f n|K − p(cid:107)K

is continuous. In order to do so, we denote q := g ◦ f n|B◦
δ \{z0} − p. Now,
δ\{z0}) and ε > 0. We choose some δ1 > 0 with Uδ1 [K] :=
let K ∈ K(B◦
δ\{z0}. As q is uniformly continuous on
{z ∈ C : dist(z, K) ≤ δ1} ⊂ B◦
Uδ1 [K], there exists a δ2 > 0 such that we have |q(z1) − q(z2)| < ε for
all points z1, z2 ∈ Uδ1[K] with |z1 − z2| < δ2. We put δ := min(δ1, δ2)
and we consider a set L ∈ K(B◦
δ\{z0}) with dK(Bδ)(L, K) < δ. Then,
for z ∈ L, there exists a point w ∈ K with |z − w| < δ ≤ δ2, and we
have dist(z, K) ≤ |z − w| < δ which yields z ∈ Uδ1[K]. Therefore, we
obtain |q(z)| ≤ |q(z) − q(w)| + |q(w)| < ε + (cid:107)q(cid:107)K. As this inequality holds
for all z ∈ L, we obtain (cid:107)q(cid:107)L ≤ ε + (cid:107)q(cid:107)K and hence (cid:107)q(cid:107)L − (cid:107)q(cid:107)K ≤ ε.
Analogously, it follows that (cid:107)q(cid:107)K − (cid:107)q(cid:107)L ≤ ε, which ﬁnally yields

Thus, each set (cid:8)K ∈ K(B◦

|ψ(L) − ψ(K)| = |(cid:107)q(cid:107)L − (cid:107)q(cid:107)K| ≤ ε.

δ\{z0}) : (cid:107)g ◦ f n|K − p(cid:107)K < 1/j(cid:9) is open in

δ\{z0}). Due to Lemma 3.4, these sets are also open in K(Bδ). Hence,

K(B◦
part i) yields that Kg is a Gδ-set in K(Bδ).

13

iii) For each E ∈ Eδ, Corollary 3.3 implies that the set

GE :=(cid:8)g ∈ H(C\{z0}) : g C(E)-universal for Cf
is comeager in H(C\{z0}). As Eδ is countable, G := (cid:84)

(cid:9)

E∈Eδ

GE is also
comeager in H(C\{z0}). Moreover, as each function g ∈ G is C(E)-
universal for Cf for all sets E ∈ Eδ, we have Eδ ⊂ Kg for all g ∈ G. As Eδ is
dense in K(Bδ) due to Lemma 3.4, it follows that Kg is dense in K(Bδ) for
all g ∈ G. Therefore, part ii) yields that for comeager many g ∈ H(C\{z0})
the set Kg is a dense Gδ-set in K(Bδ) and hence, in particular, comeager in
K(Bδ). Thus, comeager many functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}) have the property
that for comeager many K ∈ K(Bδ) the set {g ◦ f n|K : n ∈ N} is dense in
(cid:3)
C(K).

It is well-known that comeager many sets in K(Bδ) are Cantor sets, i.e. perfect
and totally disconnected (cf. [3], Remark 2 on p. 236). In particular, we have
K◦ = ∅ and hence A(K) = C(K) for comeager many K ∈ K(Bδ). For this
reason, we may replace C(K)-universality by A(K)-universality in the statement
of Theorem 3.5. However, as the considerations before Corollary 3.3 indicate,
for any set K ∈ K(B◦
δ\{z0}) with K◦ (cid:54)= ∅, there does not exist a function
in H(U\{z0}) which is A(K)-universal for Cf (cf. [13], Remark 3.3.6 iii)).
In
particular, the universality statement of Theorem 3.5 is much weaker than the
universality result which holds near attracting ﬁxed points of f (Theorem 3.1),
where we actually obtained H(W )-universality of Cf for suitable open sets W .

We want to conclude this subsection with the following consideration. For δ > 0
with Uδ[0] ⊂ V , Theorem 3.5 states that comeager many functions in H(C\{z0})
are C(K)-universal for Cf for comeager many K ∈ K(Bδ). Here, the second
“comeager many”-expression depends on the ﬁrst one, meaning that the comea-
ger subset of K(Bδ) depends on the choice of a function from the comeager
subset of H(C\{z0}) (cf. the proof of Theorem 3.5). In the following, we want
to show that this dependence can be interchanged. For two sets X and Y and
x0 ∈ X, y0 ∈ Y as well as A ⊂ X × Y , we denote

A(x0,·) := {y ∈ Y : (x0, y) ∈ A}

and A(·, y0) := {x ∈ X : (x, y0) ∈ A}.

Lemma 3.6. Let X and Y be Baire spaces and let Y be second-countable.
Moreover, let A ⊂ X × Y such that A(x,·) is a Gδ-set in Y for comeager many
x ∈ X and such that A(·, y) is comeager in X for comeager many y ∈ Y . Then
A(x,·) is comeager in Y for comeager many x ∈ X.

Proof: According to the assumption, there exists a comeager subset S of Y
such that A(·, y) is comeager in X for all y ∈ S. As Y is a Baire space, we
obtain that S is dense in Y . The second-countability of Y implies that S is
also second-countable and hence, in particular, separable. Thus, there exists a
countable subset R of S which is dense in S. Then R is also dense in Y and
y∈R A(·, y) is comeager in X. For x0 ∈ X0, we have (x0, y) ∈ A

the set X0 :=(cid:84)

14

and hence y ∈ A(x0,·) for all y ∈ R. Thus, we obtain A(x0,·) ⊃ R so that the
denseness of R in Y implies that A(x0,·) is dense in Y . Hence, A(x,·) is dense
in Y for comeager many x ∈ X. The assertion now follows from the assumption
that A(x,·) is also a Gδ-set in Y for comeager many x ∈ X.
(cid:3)
There exists a similar version of Lemma 3.6 which follows from the Kuratowski-
Ulam theorem (see e.g. [14], p. 144). This version states that for a Baire space
X, a second-countable Baire space Y and a set A ⊂ X × Y the following is
true: If A is a Gδ-set in X × Y such that A(·, y) is comeager in X for all y ∈ Y ,
then A(x,·) is comeager in Y for comeager many x ∈ X. As the property of A
being a Gδ-set in X × Y implies that A(x,·) is a Gδ in Y for all x ∈ X, Lemma
3.6 yields the same result as the above-mentioned version – but under weaker
assumptions. In order to prove the following theorem, we will see that we do
indeed need the statement of Lemma 3.6.
Theorem 3.7. For each δ > 0 with Uδ[0] ⊂ V, comeager many K ∈ K(Bδ) have
the property that comeager many functions in H(C\{z0}) are C(K)-universal
for Cf .
Proof: We denote X := K(Bδ), Y := H(C\{z0}) and

(cid:111)
δ\{z0})×H(C\{z0}) : {g ◦ f n|K : n ∈ N} dense in C(K)
Then X and Y are Baire spaces, Y is second-countable and A is a subset of
X × Y . Denoting by P the set of all complex-valued polynomials in two real
variables with Gaussian rational coeﬃcients, the complex Stone-Weierstrass the-
orem implies, analogously to the proof of Theorem 3.5, that we have

(K, g) ∈ K(B◦

δ\{z0}) is a comeager subset of K(Bδ) due to Lemma
3.4, it follows that A(K,·) is a Gδ-set in Y for comeager many K ∈ X. According
to Theorem 3.5, we have that
K ∈ K(B◦

(cid:111)
δ\{z0}) : {g ◦ f n|K : n ∈ N} dense in C(K)

A(·, g) =

(cid:110)

is comeager in X for comeager many g ∈ Y (see also the proof of Theorem 3.5,
where we have A(·, g) = Kg). Therefore, Lemma 3.6 implies that for comeager
many K ∈ X the set A(K,·) is comeager in Y .

4 Applications: Global Theory

For a complex-valued function f which is holomorphic on an open neighbour-
hood of a (super-)attracting or a neutral ﬁxed point z0 ∈ C of f , Section 3
provides several universality statements for Cf . If, in addition, the symbol f is
not only locally deﬁned but even an entire function (other than a polynomial
of degree 0 or 1), all these universality phenomenons occur on “small” parts of
the Fatou set of f . (Note that (super-)attracting ﬁxed points of f as well as
attracting petals for f at neutral ﬁxed points are always contained in Ff .) More
precisely, this means that we were able to ﬁnd open sets U ⊂ Ff or compact sets
K ⊂ Ff located near z0 with the property that Cf is H(U )- or A(K)-universal,
respectively. In case of H(U )-universality of Cf , there exist (comeager many)
functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}) for which we have

{g ◦ f n|U : n ∈ N}H(U )

= H(U ).

In this section, we will study the long-time behaviour of sequences of com-
positions of the form (g ◦ f n) on “large” parts of the Fatou set of an entire
symbol f (other than a polynomial of degree 0 or 1), e.g. on whole components
of Ff . Our aim is to determine the “richness” of the closure of sets of the form
{g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N} for “many” functions g ∈ H(Ω), where now G should be a
“large” open invariant subset of Ff and Ω is a domain in C which contains
G. In contrast to the local situations which we have considered in the previous
section, we now cannot expect that there exists a function g ∈ H(Ω) such that
the closure of the set of compositions {g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N} equals the whole space
H(G), i.e. we cannot expect that Cf is H(G)-universal. The reason for this is
that whenever f is not injective on G – which is likely to be the case for “large”
subsets G of Ff – then there exists the following “natural restriction” for each
function

h ∈ {g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N}H(G)(cid:15) {g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N}

(cf. the considerations after Theorem 1.3): Choosing a strictly increasing se-
quence (nk) in N such that (g ◦ f nk ) converges to h locally uniformly on G, we
obtain for any N ∈ N and any points z, w ∈ G with z (cid:54)= w and f N (z) = f N (w)
that

h(z) = lim

k→∞ g(f nk (z)) = lim

k→∞ g(f nk (w)) = h(w).

This means that we can approximate only those functions in H(G) via sub-
sequences of (g ◦ f n) which have the property of assuming the same value at
all points in G which eventually coincide under the iteration of f . Therefore,
the composition operator Cf cannot be H(G)-universal. In this situation, the
challenge now consists in determining the closure of the set of compositions
{g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N} in H(G). In order to do so, it is useful to consider the set
ω(G, g, f ), which shall denote the set of all functions h : G → C for which there
exists a strictly increasing sequence (nk) in N such that (g ◦ f nk ) converges to
h locally uniformly on G. Using this terminology, we have

{g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N}H(G)

= ω(G, g, f ) ∪ {g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N} .

Let z0 ∈ C be an attracting ﬁxed point of f and let A(z0) := {z : f n(z) → z0} be
the basin of attraction of z0 under f , which is a union of components of Ff (see
e.g. [7], Theorem III.2.1). In particular, the Schr¨oder domain of f containing z0
(i.e. the component of Ff which contains z0) is a subset of A(z0) (cf. Theorem
1.6). Moreover, we consider the backward orbit of z0 under f , which is given
n∈N {z : f n(z) = z0} . By deﬁnition, the set A(z0)\O−(z0) is
completely invariant under f . In particular, f is not injective on A(z0)\O−(z0).
As already described in the introduction of this chapter, it is now our aim
to characterize sets of the form ω(G, g, f ) for suitable “large” open subsets
G of A(z0)\O−(z0) and “many” functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}). Due to the above
considerations, each function h ∈ ω(G, g, f ) must have the property of assuming
the same value at all points z, w ∈ G for which we have f N (z) = f N (w) for
some N ∈ N. Thus, in order to determine the set ω(G, g, f ), we have to look for
holomorphic functions on G which fulﬁl this property. Clearly, this holds for all
constant functions – but the crucial question we are facing here is whether there
exist any non-constant functions for which this is true. As we do not have any
information concerning this fact at ﬁrst view, it is natural to remind ourselves
that f is locally conjugated near the attracting ﬁxed point z0 to the linear
function w (cid:55)→ λw with λ := f(cid:48)(z0) (where 0 < |λ| < 1). This means that there
exist open neighbourhoods U of z0 and V of 0 with f (U ) ⊂ U and λV ⊂ V as
well as a conformal map ϕ : U → V such that the equation ϕ◦ f n = λn · ϕ holds
on U for all integers n ∈ N (cf. Subsection 3.1). According to the considerations
before Theorem 3.1, we have U ⊂ A(z0). It is well-known that the conjugation
map ϕ can be extended holomorphically to the entire basin of attraction of z0
and that the extended ϕ fulﬁls the same functional equation as ϕ (see e.g. [7],
p. 32), i.e. there exists a holomorphic function Φ : A(z0) → C with Φ|U = ϕ
such that the equation Φ ◦ f n = λn · Φ holds on A(z0) for all n ∈ N. As
the image Φ(A(z0)) is a dense subset of the complex plane (cf. [13], Remark
4.1.1 and p. 66), the function Φ quasiconjugates f|A(z0) to w (cid:55)→ λw on C. For
z, w ∈ A(z0) and N ∈ N with f N (z) = f N (w), we have

Φ(z) =

Φ(f N (z))

λN

=

Φ(f N (w))

λN

= Φ(w),

i.e. the non-constant holomorphic function Φ assumes the same value at all
points in A(z0) which eventually coincide under the iteration of f . Knowing
that Φ fulﬁls the property of assuming the same value at all points in A(z0)
which eventually coincide under the iteration of f , we obtain that this is already
true for a whole class of functions, namely for all compositions ψ ◦ Φ, where ψ
is deﬁned on Φ(A(z0)). Therefore, we introduce the following notation:
Deﬁnition 4.1. For G ⊂ A(z0) open, we put

HΦ(G) := {ψ ◦ Φ|G : ψ ∈ H(Φ(G))} .

17

We remark that the set HΦ(G) is a subspace of H(G) and that it does not
depend on the choice of the function Φ, i.e. if there exist open neighbourhoods

U(cid:48) of z0 and V (cid:48) of 0 as well as a conformal map (cid:101)ϕ : U(cid:48) → V (cid:48) with (cid:101)ϕ ◦ f = λ ·(cid:101)ϕ
on U(cid:48), then there exists some c ∈ C\{0} with ϕ = c·(cid:101)ϕ on U ∩ U(cid:48) (cf. [7], p. 28f.).
Hence, the holomorphic extension (cid:101)Φ of (cid:101)ϕ to A(z0) which fulﬁls (cid:101)Φ ◦ f = λ ·(cid:101)Φ on
A(z0) equals c ·(cid:101)Φ so that we obtain H(cid:101)Φ(G) = HΦ(G).

For each function h ∈ HΦ(G), we have h(z) = h(w) for all points z, w ∈ G
with f N (z) = f N (w) for some N ∈ N. Thus, for G ⊂ A(z0)\O−(z0) open
and g ∈ H(C\{z0}), each function in HΦ(G) is a possible candidate for being
contained in the set ω(G, g, f ). In the following, it will be our aim to prove the
existence of a “large” open subset G0 of A(z0)\O−(z0) such that we actually
have ω(G0, g, f ) = HΦ(G0) and hence, in particular,

(cid:8)g ◦ f n|G0 : n ∈ N(cid:9)H(G0)

= HΦ(G0) ∪ (cid:8)g ◦ f n|G0 : n ∈ N(cid:9)

for “many” functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}). In order to show that such a “large” set
G0 exists, we introduce the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 4.2. A function g ∈ H(A(z0)\{z0}) is called locally universal for
Cf if there exist open neighbourhoods U of z0 and V of 0 as well as a conformal
map ϕ : U → V with ϕ ◦ f = λ · ϕ on U such that the set {g ◦ f n|W : n ∈ N} is
dense in H(W ) for all W ∈ U0(U\{z0}).
As Picard’s little theorem implies either f n(C) = C or the existence of a point
af ∈ C with f n(C) = C\{af} for all n ∈ N, we may assume without loss of
generality that we always have af /∈ U whenever we consider a locally universal
function g for Cf . Theorem 3.1 yields that the set

G :=(cid:8)g ∈ H(C\{z0}) : g|A(z0)\{z0} locally universal for Cf

(cid:9)

is a comeager set in H(C\{z0}). The following lemma generalizes the statement
of Theorem 3.1:
Lemma 4.3. Let g be locally universal for Cf , N ∈ N0 and W ∈ U0(U\{z0}).

Then we have ω(cid:0)f−N (W ), g, f(cid:1) ⊃ HΦ

(cid:0)f−N (W )(cid:1).

Proof: We ﬁrst observe that we have f N (f−N (W )) = W . In fact, the inclusion
f N (f−N (W )) ⊂ W always holds, and the reverse inclusion is true whenever
the set W is contained in the range of f N . As the possibly existing Picard
exceptional value of f is not contained in U ⊃ W , this is indeed the case.
Hence, as Φ quasi-conjugates f|A(z0) to w (cid:55)→ λw on C, we have

Φ(cid:0)f−N (W )(cid:1) =
(cid:0)f−N (W )(cid:1). Then there exists some ψ ∈ H(cid:0)Φ(f−N (W ))(cid:1) with

λN · Φ(cid:0)f N (f−N (W ))(cid:1) =
λN · Φ(W ).
λN · Φ ◦ f N|f−N (W ) =(cid:101)h ◦ f N|f−N (W ),

h = ψ ◦ Φ|f−N (W ) = ψ ◦ 1

Now, let h ∈ HΦ

where (cid:101)h := ψ ◦ 1
(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)g ◦ f m1|W −(cid:101)h

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)f N (K)

λN · Φ|W ∈ H(W ). For K ⊂ f−N (W ) compact, f N (K) is
a compact subset of W so that the denseness of {g ◦ f n|W : n ∈ N} in H(W )
yields an integer m1 ∈ N with
= (cid:107)g ◦ f m1 ◦ f N −(cid:101)h ◦ f N(cid:107)K = (cid:107)g ◦ f m1+N − h(cid:107)K.

1 >
As the space H(W ) has no isolated points, each set {g ◦ f n|W : n ≥ m} is dense
in H(W ). Thus, we inductively ﬁnd a strictly increasing sequence (mj) in N with
(cid:107)g ◦ f mj +N − h(cid:107)K < 1/j for all j ∈ N. Hence, we have uniform convergence
g ◦ f mj +N → h on K. But this already implies the existence of a strictly
increasing sequence (nk) in N with g ◦ f nk → h locally uniformly on f−N (W )
(cid:3)
For g ∈ G, W ∈ U0(U\{z0}) and N = 0, Lemma 4.3 states ω(W, g, f ) ⊃ HΦ(W ).
As each function h ∈ H(W ) can be written as

(see e.g. [13], Lemma A.4), i.e. we have h ∈ ω(cid:0)f−N (W ), g, f(cid:1).

h = h ◦ ϕ−1|ϕ(W ) ◦ ϕ|W =(cid:0)h ◦ ϕ−1|ϕ(W )

(cid:1) ◦ Φ|W ∈ HΦ(W ),

f (W ) ⊂ W . Then D :=(cid:83)

we actually have HΦ(W ) = H(W ) and hence ω(W, g, f ) ⊃ H(W ), which is
equivalent to the fact that the set {g ◦ f n|W : n ∈ N} is dense in H(W ). There-
fore, the statement of Lemma 4.3 in case of g ∈ G and N = 0 is just the
statement of Theorem 3.1.
Corollary 4.4. Let g be locally universal for Cf and let W ∈ U0(U\{z0}) with
f−n(W ) is an open subset of A(z0)\O−(z0) and
n∈N0
we have ω(D, g, f ) ⊃ HΦ(D).
Proof: Because of W ⊂ U ⊂ A(z0), the backward invariance of A(z0) under f
yields D ⊂ A(z0). Assuming that there exists a point z ∈ D ∩ O−(z0), there
would exist integers n ∈ N0, k ∈ N with f n(z) ∈ W and f k(z) = z0. In case of
k ≤ n, we would obtain z0 = f n(z) ∈ W ⊂ U\{z0}, a contradiction. For k > n,
it would follow that z0 = f k(z) = f k−n(f n(z)) ∈ f k−n(W ) ⊂ W ⊂ U\{z0}, the
same contradiction. Thus, we have D ⊂ A(z0)\O−(z0). Now, let h ∈ HΦ(D).
Then there exists some ψ ∈ H(Φ(D)) with h = ψ ◦ Φ|D. For K ⊂ D compact,
n∈E f−n(W ). Putting N := max E,

there exists a ﬁnite set E ⊂ N0 with K ⊂(cid:83)
f N (f−n(W )) ⊂ (cid:91)

f N (K) ⊂ (cid:91)

the invariance of W under f yields

f N−n(W ) ⊂ W.

n∈E

n∈E

Hence, K is a compact subset of f−N (W ). According to Lemma 4.3, we have

(cid:0)f−N (W )(cid:1) ⊂ ω(cid:0)f−N (W ), g, f(cid:1).

h|f−N (W ) = ψ|Φ(f−N (W )) ◦ Φ|f−N (W ) ∈ HΦ

Thus, there exists a strictly increasing sequence (mj) in N such that (g ◦ f mj )
converges to h locally uniformly on f−N (W ). In particular, we obtain uniform
convergence g◦ f mj → h on K. As above, this implies the existence of a strictly
increasing sequence (nk) in N with g ◦ f nk → h locally uniformly on D, i.e. we
have h ∈ ω(D, g, f ).
(cid:3)

In the following lemma, we prove the existence of a set which fulﬁls the assump-
tions of Corollary 4.4, i.e. we construct an open subset U0 of U\{z0} which has
no holes and which is invariant under f .

Lemma 4.5.

i) Let W ⊂ U be dense in U . Then the set(cid:83)

f−n(W ) is dense in A(z0).
ii) There exists a set U0 ∈ U0(U\{z0}) with f (U0) ⊂ U0 and such that U0 is

n∈N0

dense in U .

Proof:

i) Let z ∈ A(z0) and ε > 0. Choosing 0 < r ≤ ε with Ur[z] ⊂ A(z0), the
Vitali-Porter theorem yields that we have uniform convergence f n → z0 on
Ur[z]. Hence, there exists an N ∈ N0 with f N (Ur[z]) ⊂ U . As f N (Ur(z))
is a non-empty open subset of U , the denseness of W in U implies the
existence of a point w ∈ W ∩ f N (Ur(z)) so that there exists a point

(cid:101)z ∈ Ur(z) with f N ((cid:101)z) = w ∈ W . Thus, we have |(cid:101)z − z| < r ≤ ε and
(cid:101)z ∈ f−N (W ) ⊂(cid:83)

f−n(W ).

n∈N0

ii) Assuming without loss of generality that V = Uδ(0) for some δ > 0, we
ﬁrst show that there exists a set V0 ∈ U0(V \{0}) with λV0 ⊂ V0 and
such that V0 is dense in V . In order to do so, we consider the connected
set S0 := {δλt : t ∈ (0,∞)} ∪ {0}, which is the union of the trace of a
logarithmic spiral and its “endpoint” 0. Putting V0 := V \S0, we obtain
that V0 is an open subset of V \{0} which is dense in V and has no holes
(cf. the left-hand side of Figure 1). In order to show that the inclusion
λV0 ⊂ V0 holds, now let z ∈ V0. Then we have z ∈ Uδ(0) and z /∈ S0,
and due to 0 < |λ| < 1 it follows that λz ∈ V \{0}. Assuming that there
exists some t ∈ (0,∞) with λz = δλt, we would obtain z = δλt−1. On the
one hand, this is impossible for t ≤ 1 because in this case it would follow
that |z| = δ|λ|t−1 ≥ δ, a contradiction. On the other hand, z = δλt−1 is
also not possible for t > 1 because we have z /∈ S0. Therefore, we obtain
that λz ∈ V \S0 = V0. Hence, there exists a dense subset V0 of V with
V0 ∈ U0(V \{0}) and λV0 ⊂ V0. We now consider the set U0 := ϕ−1(V0),
which is an open subset of ϕ−1(V \{0}) = U\{z0}. The denseness of V0 in
V and the continuity of ϕ−1 : V → U imply that U0 = ϕ−1(V0) is dense
in ϕ−1(V ) = U . Moreover, as V0 does not have any holes, the invariance
of the number of holes implies that U0 has no holes as well. Finally, as ϕ
conjugates f|U to w (cid:55)→ λw, we obtain from λV0 ⊂ V0 that

f (U0) = f(cid:0)ϕ−1(V0)(cid:1) = ϕ−1(λV0) ⊂ ϕ−1(V0) = U0,

which completes the proof.

Lemma 4.5 and Corollary 4.4 yield that G0 :=(cid:83)

f−n(U0) is an open dense
subset of A(z0)\O−(z0) for which we have ω(G0, g, f ) ⊃ HΦ(G0) for each lo-
cally universal function g for Cf . The right-hand side of Figure 1 displays a

Figure 1

MATLAB plot of the set G0 in case that f equals the ﬁnite Blaschke product
B : C∞ → C∞, B(z) := z(z − α)/(1 − αz). In this situation, we consider the
attracting ﬁxed point at the origin (with multiplier B(cid:48)(0) = −α) and its basin
of attraction A(0) = D. Here, the exceptional set D\G0 looks like a union of
pairwise disjoint traces of injective rectiﬁable paths. In general, it is well-known
that the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the trace of an injective rectiﬁable path deﬁned
on a non-singleton compact interval equals one (see e.g. [8], Theorem 6.2.7).
Indeed, one can show that the Hausdorﬀ dimension of A(z0)\G0 is always one
(cf. [13], Lemma 4.1.9 and Lemma B.7).
In the following, we will show that the reverse inclusion ω(D, g, f ) ⊂ HΦ(D)
holds for each open subset D of A(z0)\O−(z0) and all g ∈ H(A(z0)\{z0}).
As above, the special structure of the function Φ will play an important role
here. For z, w ∈ A(z0), we write z ∼ w if there exists some N ∈ N0 with
f N (z) = f N (w). Then ∼ deﬁnes an equivalence relation on A(z0), and according
to the considerations at the beginning of this section, we have z ∼ w if and only
if Φ(z) = Φ(w) (observe that Φ|U = ϕ is injective).
Lemma 4.6. For g ∈ H(A(z0)\{z0}) and D ⊂ A(z0)\O−(z0) open, we have
ω(D, g, f ) ⊂ HΦ(D).
Proof: We write ∼ for the restriction of the above equivalence relation to
D and [z]∼ for the equivalence class of z ∈ D. Moreover, let D/∼ be the
quotient induced by ∼ and let p : D → D/∼, p(z) := [z]∼, be the associated
quotient map. For h ∈ ω(D, g, f ), there exists a strictly increasing sequence
(nk) in N such that (g ◦ f nk ) converges to h locally uniformly on D. Hence, h
is holomorphic on D, and it follows for all points z, w ∈ D with z ∼ w that

h(z) = lim

k→∞ g(f nk (z)) = lim

k→∞ g(f nk (w)) = h(w).

21

Thus, the map(cid:101)h : D/∼ → C,(cid:101)h(cid:0)[z]∼(cid:1) := h(z), is well-deﬁned and fulﬁls h =(cid:101)h◦p.
Due to the above considerations, the map (cid:101)Φ : D/∼ → Φ(D), (cid:101)Φ(cid:0)[z]∼(cid:1) := Φ(z),
is well-deﬁned, bijective and fulﬁls Φ|D =(cid:101)Φ ◦ p. Altogether, we have

h =(cid:101)h ◦ p =(cid:101)h ◦(cid:101)Φ−1 ◦(cid:101)Φ ◦ p =

(cid:16)(cid:101)h ◦(cid:101)Φ−1(cid:17) ◦ Φ|D.

it follows that(cid:101)h◦(cid:101)Φ−1 is holomorphic on Φ(D) (see [13], Lemma A.5 and cf. [19],

As h is holomorphic on D and as Φ|D : D → Φ(D) is holomorphic and surjective,
Exercise 14 on p. 228) so that we obtain h ∈ HΦ(D).
(cid:3)
Combining Corollary 4.4, Lemma 4.5 and Lemma 4.6, we have proved the fol-
lowing concluding statement:
Theorem 4.7. G0 is an open dense subset of A(z0)\O−(z0) such that we have
dimH A(z0)\G0 = 1 and

for each locally universal function g for Cf .

ω(G0, g, f ) = HΦ(G0)

In particular, according to the consideration after Deﬁnition 4.2, the identity
ω(G0, g, f ) = HΦ(G0) holds for comeager many functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}).
Hence the set of all functions in H(C\{z0}) which are HΦ(G0)-universal for
Cf is a comeager set in H(C\{z0}).

we consider the open set Gk :=(cid:83)
ponent of Ff containing Pk) can be written as Dk =(cid:83)

4.2 Leau Domains
Let z0 ∈ C be a neutral ﬁxed point of f . For m := min{n ∈ N : f (n+1)(z0) (cid:54)= 0},
there exist m attracting petals P1, . . . , Pm for f , and for each k ∈ {1, . . . , m},
there exists a conformal map ϕk on Pk such that the equation ϕk ◦ f n = ϕk + n
holds on Pk for all integers n ∈ N (cf. Subsection 3.2). For each k ∈ {1, . . . , m},
f−n(Pk), which is completely invariant
under f . As the Leau domain Dk of f which contains Pk (i.e. Dk is the com-
Dk,n, where Dk,n
is the component of f−n(Pk) which contains Pk (see e.g. [23], p. 76), we obtain
that Dk is a subset of Gk. Analogously to the situation of Subsection 4.1, the
image Φk(Gk) is dense in C, and it is well-known that the conjugation map ϕk
can be extended holomorphically to Gk and that the extended ϕk fulﬁls the
same functional equation as ϕk (see e.g. [16], Corollary 10.9), i.e. there exists a
holomorphic function Φk : Gk → C with Φk|Pk = ϕk such that the equation
Φk ◦ f n = Φk + n holds on Gk for all n ∈ N. Hence, for z, w ∈ Gk and N ∈ N
with f N (z) = f N (w), we have

n∈N0

n∈N0

Φk(z) = Φk(f N (z)) − N = Φk(f N (w)) − N = Φk(w),

i.e. the non-constant holomorphic function Φk assumes the same value at all
points in Gk which eventually coincide under the iteration of f . Considering
the subspace

HΦk (Gk) :=(cid:8)ψ ◦ Φk : ψ ∈ H(Φk(Gk))(cid:9),

22

the same approach as in Subsection 4.1 yields the following result (cf. [13], The-
orem 4.2.3):
Theorem 4.8. For comeager many functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}), we have

ω(Gk, g, f ) = HΦk (Gk).

In contrast to the situation of Theorem 4.7, we do not have to restrict ourselves
to a “large” open subset of Gk in order to obtain the identity as stated in
Theorem 4.8. The reason for this is that each attracting petal Pk has no holes
and is invariant under f . Therefore, the inclusion ω(Gk, g, f ) ⊃ HΦk (Gk) can
be proved in exactly the same way as in the proofs of Lemma 4.3 and Corollary
4.4.

Now, let us assume that we have m ≥ 2. Deﬁning P :=(cid:83)m
(cid:91)

of all attracting petals, we now consider the set

k=1 Pk to be the union

m(cid:91)

f−n(Pk) =

As all attracting petals are pairwise disjoint and invariant under f , the sets Gk
are pairwise disjoint. Moreover, the complete invariance of each set Gk under
f implies that G is also completely invariant under f . The question arises to
determine the sets ω(G, g, f ) for suitable functions g ∈ H(G). In order to do
so, it seems natural to consider the function

Φ : G → C, Φ(z) := Φk(z), if z ∈ Gk.

As each function Φk quasiconjugates f|Gk to the translation w (cid:55)→ w + 1 on C
and as each set Gk is invariant under f , we obtain that Φ quasiconjugates f|G
to w (cid:55)→ w + 1 on C, i.e. the equation Φ ◦ f n = Φ + n holds on G for all integers
n ∈ N. Hence, considering the subspace

HΦ(G) :=(cid:8)ψ ◦ Φ|D : ψ ∈ H(Φ(G))(cid:9),

the following statement can be proved analogously to the ﬁrst part of the proof
of Theorem 4.2.3 in [13] (using exactly the same techniques as in the proofs of
Lemma 4.3 and Corollary 4.4):
Lemma 4.9. For comeager many functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}), we have

ω(G, g, f ) ⊃ HΦ(G).

However, in this situation, we cannot prove the reverse inclusion as we have done
before. The reason for this is the following: Considering on G the equivalence
relation

z ∼ w :⇔ there exists some N ∈ N0 with f N (z) = f N (w),

23

we obtain that the equality Φ(z) = Φ(w) for z, w ∈ G now does not imply
z ∼ w anymore (however, due to the above quasiconjugation, z ∼ w still yields
Φ(z) = Φ(w)). Indeed, let k, l ∈ {1, . . . , m} with k (cid:54)= l. As stated above, the
intersection Φk(Gk) ∩ Φl(Gl) is dense in C and in particular non-empty. Thus,
there exist points zk ∈ Gk and zl ∈ Gl with Φk(zk) = Φl(zl), i.e. we have
Φ(zk) = Φ(zl). But as Gk and Gl are disjoint and invariant under f , we have
f n(zk) (cid:54)= f n(zl) for all n ∈ N and hence zk (cid:54)∼ zl. According to this observation,
it might be the case that the set ω(G, g, f ) is a proper superset of the subspace
HΦ(G). In order to avoid the trouble that Φ(z) = Φ(w) does not imply z ∼ w,
it is reasonable to consider the function

Φ∗ : G → C × {1, . . . , m}, Φ∗(z) := (Φk(z), k), if z ∈ Gk.

As each function Φk quasiconjugates f|Gk to the translation w (cid:55)→ w + 1 and
as each set Gk is invariant under f , we obtain that Φ∗ quasiconjugates f|G to
the map (w, k) (cid:55)→ (w, k) + (1, 0), i.e. the equation Φ∗ ◦ f n = Φ∗ + (n, 0) holds
on G for all integers n ∈ N. Thus, for z, w ∈ G with z ∼ w, it follows that
Φ∗(z) = Φ∗(w). Moreover, in contrast to the above considerations about the
function Φ, now the reverse implication also holds. Indeed, for z, w ∈ G with
z ∈ Gk, w ∈ Gl and Φ∗(z) = Φ∗(w), we have (Φk(z), k) = (Φl(w), l). Hence,
we obtain k = l and thus Φk(z) = Φk(w). Analogously to the corresponding
considerations in Subsection 4.1, this yields z ∼ w. Deﬁning
HΦ∗ (G) := {ψ ◦ Φ∗|G : ψ ∈ H∗(Φ∗(G))} ,
m(cid:92)

(cid:8)ψ : Φ∗(G) → C : ψ(cid:0)r|Φk(Gk), k(cid:1) ∈ H(cid:0)Φk(Gk)(cid:1)(cid:9) ,

where

H∗(Φ∗(G)) :=

k=1

one can show that H∗(Φ∗(G)) is a subspace of H(G) which properly contains
HΦ(G) (cf. [13], Lemma 4.2.8). Using similar techniques as in Subsection 4.1,
the following concluding statement can be proved (cf. [13], p. 79ﬀ.):
Theorem 4.10. For comeager many functions g ∈ H(C\{z0}), we have

ω(G, g, f ) = HΦ∗ (G).

4.3 Other Fatou Components

In this ﬁnal subsection, we want to state several results concerning the question
which level of universality the composition operator Cf can have on B¨ottcher
domains, Siegel discs, Baker domains and wandering domains of f . It is easy

to see that the set ω(cid:0)G\O−(z0), g, f(cid:1) only contains constant functions if G is a

B¨ottcher domain of f which contains a superattracting ﬁxed point z0 of f and
g is holomorphic on C\{z0}, and that there exist constant functions which are
not contained in the closure of {g ◦ f n|G : n ∈ N} in H(G) if G is an invariant
Siegel disc of f and g is holomorphic on G (cf. [13], Remark 4.3.2 and Lemma

24

4.3.3). Indeed, in these two situations, Cf cannot be H(cid:0)G\O−(z0)(cid:1)-universal

or H(G)-universal, respectively, because of lack of injectivity of the symbol f on
G\O−(z0) in the ﬁrst case and because of lack of “run-away behaviour” of the
sequence of iterates (f n) on G in the latter case (cf. Theorem 1.3). Requiring
that f is a transcendental entire function which is injective on a Baker domain
or a wandering domain, we again obtain universality of Cf . More precisely, the
k∈N f k(G) for the forward orbit

following statements hold (we write O+(G) :=(cid:83)

of G under f ):

Theorem 4.11.

i) Let G be an invariant Baker domain of f and let f be injective on G.
Then the set of all entire functions which are H(G)-universal for Cf is a
comeager set in H(C).

ii) Let G be a wandering domain of f , let f n be injective on G for all n ∈ N
and let f n|G → ∞. Then the set of all entire functions which are H(W )-
universal for Cf for all W ∈ U0(O+(G)) is a comeager set in H(C). If, in
addition, G is simply connected, the set of all entire functions which are
H(O+(G))-universal for Cf is a comeager set in H(C).

Proof:

i) By deﬁnition, G is unbounded and hence simply connected (see [1], The-
orem 1). Considering the domain Ω := C and the open set D := G ⊂ Ω
and observing that the map f|D : D → D is injective and that we have
locally uniform convergence f n|D → ∞ ∈ ∂∞Ω due to the Vitali-Porter
theorem, the assertion follows from Corollary 2.6.

ii) Considering the domain Ω := C and the open set D := O+(G) ⊂ Ω,
we obtain that the map f|D : D → D is injective (observe that, as G
is a wandering domain of f , the sets f k(G) are pairwise disjoint). As
we have locally uniform convergence f n|D → ∞ ∈ ∂∞Ω (cf. [13], proof
of Theorem 4.5.3), the ﬁrst assertion follows from Corollary 2.5. If G is
simply connected, the invariance of the number of holes yields that each
set f k(G) also has no holes (observe that each iterate f k is injective on
(cid:3)
G). Hence, the second assertion follows directly from the ﬁrst one.

We remark that there exist several examples of transcendental entire functions
which are injective on Baker domains (see e.g. [4], p. 526, [2], subsection 5.2 and
[22], Theorem 1) and diverse examples of transcendental entire functions which
have a simply connected wandering domain on which each iterate is injective
and on which the iterates converge to the point at inﬁnity (see e.g. [9], Example
2 and [25], Theorem 3.4).
