Abstract

We compute the next-to-leading order virtual QCD corrections to Higgs pair
production via gluon fusion. We present analytic results for the two-loop con-
tributions to the spin-0 and spin-2 form factors in the amplitude. The reducible
contributions, given by the double-triangle diagrams, are evaluated exactly while
the two-loop irreducible diagrams are evaluated by an asymptotic expansion in
heavy top quark mass up to and including terms of O(1/m8
t ). Assuming that
the ﬁnite top-quark mass eﬀects are of similar size in the entire range of partonic
energies we estimate that mass eﬀects can reduce the hadronic cross section by
at most 10%.

Introduction

After the discovery of the Higgs boson in Run 1 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1, 2],
one of the major targets of Run 2 is the experimental exploration of its properties. In Run 1,
the measured Higgs boson production rate and the extracted values of the Higgs couplings
to fermions and to gauge bosons have been found to be compatible with the predictions of
the Standard Model (SM) within an experimental accuracy of (10 – 20)% [3]. On the other
hand, the self-couplings of the Higgs boson, which in the SM are determined in terms of the
mass of the Higgs boson and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs ﬁeld and are thus
fully predicted, have not been probed yet. They are accessible in multi-Higgs production
processes [4, 5] though a measurement of the quartic Higgs self-coupling lies beyond the
reach of the LHC [6,7]. Instead, for the trilinear Higgs self-coupling various studies showed
that it might be accessible at the LHC in Higgs pair production in b¯bγγ [8–13], b¯bτ ¯τ [9,14],
b¯bW +W − [15] and b¯bb¯b [16–18] ﬁnal states.

Higgs pair production is not only interesting as a probe of the trilinear Higgs self-
coupling, but its rate can be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by new physics eﬀects. For the dominant
Higgs pair production mode, gluon fusion, this can, for instance, occur due to new loop
contributions [19], in models with novel hh¯tt coupling [20–22] or if the Higgs boson pair is
produced through the decay of a heavy new resonance. The latter two possibilities can lead
to a strong increase of the cross section. First limits on such scenarios have been given in
refs. [23–27].

A precise prediction of the gluon fusion Higgs-pair production channel is essential to
constrain new physics or to determine the Higgs self-coupling. The gluon fusion process
is mediated by heavy fermions via diagrams with box and triangle topologies and is hence
loop-induced already at the leading order (LO). In the “triangle” contribution a single Higgs
boson splits via an s-channel exchange into two Higgs bosons, thus it contains the trilinear
Higgs self-coupling. The “box” contribution plays the role of an irreducible background, as
it does not incorporate the trilinear Higgs self-coupling.

In the SM, the LO cross section is fully known since the late eighties [28]. However,
similarly to what happens in single Higgs production, one expects the LO contribution to
be subject to large radiative corrections. A computation of a 2 → 2 process at higher orders
is extremely challenging. The next-to-leading order (NLO) “triangle” contribution can be
borrowed from the production of a single Higgs boson [29–32], whereas a full computation
of the NLO “box” form factors is at the moment not available and technically much more
diﬃcult. Higher order corrections to Higgs pair production are, however, available in the
eﬀective theory with inﬁnite top mass, mt, or, equivalently, in the limit of vanishing external
momentum, at NLO [33] and more recently also at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO)
[34, 35].1 Soft gluon resummation at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy
has been performed in refs. [41,42]. Whereas the approximation of small external momenta
was shown to work quite well for single Higgs production [29], it can be expected to be
less eﬀective for pair production, due to the larger energy scale that characterizes the
latter process. The approximation can, however, be improved by factoring out the full

1For beyond the SM extensions, NLO QCD corrections in the limit for vanishing external momenta are
available for the SM with additional dimension six operators [36], for an additional scalar singlet [37], for
the two-Higgs doublet model [38], for composite Higgs models [39], for the MSSM [33,40] and NMSSM [40].

LO cross section. The error due to the inﬁnite top-mass limit for the part related to the
real corrections has been estimated in refs. [43, 44] to be roughly −10% by comparing
the mt → ∞ limit result with the numerical calculation of the real corrections with full
top-mass dependence. Instead, the uncertainty of the eﬀective-theory result for the virtual
corrections has been estimated in refs. [45] by the inclusion of higher orders in an expansion
in small external momenta ﬁnding a positive shift with respect to the mt → ∞ result. This
leads to an estimate of the uncertainties due to mass corrections at NLO, including also
the the real contributions expanded in small external momenta, of ±10%, with a reduction
to ±5% when the NNLO eﬀective theory result is included [46] .

In this paper we reexamine the evaluation of the virtual NLO QCD corrections in
Higgs pair production. We present an exact result for the reducible contribution given by
the double-triangle diagrams, while the irreducible diagrams are evaluated via an asymp-
totic expansion in the top mass. Our work diﬀers from the similar previous analyses in
refs. [45, 46] by the fact that we perform the asymptotic expansion up to and including
terms O(1/m8
t ) at the level of the amplitudes and not of the cross section, allowing us to
derive simple analytic expressions for the spin-0 and spin-2 form factors in the amplitudes.
The latter could be used in the future as a check of the result, in the relevant center-of-mass
partonic energy region, when a complete calculation of the virtual corrections will be avail-
able. Furthermore, our expressions can be easily implemented in Monte-Carlo codes that
compute the hadronic cross section in order to achieve a better description of the partonic
center-of-mass energy region below the the 2 mt threshold.

In order to quantify the ﬁnite top-mass eﬀects in the NLO corrections to the hadronic
cross section we make two diﬀerent comparisons:
i) We compare the NLO cross sections
computed using diﬀerent orders in the top-mass expansion. ii) We compare the cross section
including the O(1/m8
t ) terms with the one computed factorizing the exact LO cross section
while evaluating the NLO correction factor in the mt → ∞ limit.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we give general formulae for the Higgs pair
production cross section. In the next section we discuss diﬀerent large-mass evaluations of
the LO cross section comparing them with exact result. In section 4 we outline our method
of calculation of the NLO corrections that are presented in the next section where we also
discuss their numerical impact and the estimate of the error due to the mass eﬀects in the
virtual corrections. Finally, in section 6 we draw our conclusions. The paper is completed
with an appendix where we present the analytic result for the expanded NLO form factors
up to and including terms of O(1/m8
t ).

2 Double Higgs Production via gluon fusion

In this section we summarize some general results on the Higgs boson pair production via
the gluon fusion mechanism in proton–proton collisions, pp → HH. The hadronic cross
section for the process p + p → H + H + X at center-of-mass energy
s, can be written as:

The evaluation of the LO cross section using for F1 and F2 the values obtained via the
LET calculation, i.e. the leading term in the large top-mass expansion in eqs. (19–21), gives
a poor approximation of the exact result. Furthermore, the validity of this approximation is
quite sensitive to the hadronic center-of-mass energy and to the choice of the renormalization
and factorization scales [51]. This is at variant with the case of single Higgs production
where the LET result gives a quite accurate estimate of the cross section. Indeed, the LET

result is expected to be reliable in the region of partonic energies below the
threshold. In Higgs pair production, also the region above the 2 mt threshold contributes

the vanishing external momenta condition is obviously not satisﬁed and therefore the result

The inclusion of more terms in a large top-mass expansion of the form factors does not
improve the evaluation of the LO cross section [51, 52]. The reason is easily understood

We remark that the evaluation of F1 and F2 via a large mass expansion has a range
of validity up to the 2 mt threshold. Describing the region above this threshold via the
LET results means to replace the exact form factors by constant values. Instead using the
sum of few terms in the large mass expansion means to replace F1 and F2 by a powerlike
combination of ˆs/m2
t that has a wrong behavior when ˆs grows. As a consequence, the
partonic cross section in eq. (11) grows, for large values of the partonic center-of-mass
energy, as ˆs in the former case, while as ˆsn+1/m2n
in the latter case with n the order of the
t
√
expansion. Although in both cases the behavior of the partonic cross section in the region
ˆs > 2 mt is not described correctly, it is evident that in this region the cross section is
much better (or less worse) approximated by its LET value than by including additional
terms in the large mass expansion. As a further remark, we recall that the full form factors
ˆs > 2 mt which cannot be described by an expansion in
develop an imaginary part above
√
small external momenta. This imaginary part is however smaller than the real part up to
ˆs ≈ 450 GeV.
In Fig. 4 we present the partonic cross section as a function of

ˆs. The exact cross
section (solid black line), σ(0)

lines), σ(0)
app,n, obtained using for the form factors the expansions in eqs. (19–21) to the order
n. The ﬁgure tells us that the validity of an estimate of the hadronic cross section from
eq. (1) based on the use of σ(0)
app,n depends on the relative weights in the hadronic integral of

ˆs are going to
each other. With the increase in the hadronic energy, regions with larger
contribute more to the hadronic cross section, so that the LET approximation is going to
grow in size and therefore become either closer to the full cross section or overestimating
it. For instance for
s = 100 TeV the LET result overestimates the full cross section by a
factor ∼ 2.2.

the large-mass expanded results for F1 and F2 in the entire range of partonic energies is not
going to be realistic. An alternative estimate, based on the use of the maximal approximate

mass expansion only up to a cut

our computational ability. However, it seems feasible to obtain an approximate evaluation
of latter form factors using the method of asymptotic expansions [58, 59]. Two diﬀerent

The two-loop diagrams that belong to class ii) are those containing either two triple-
gluon vertices (ﬁg. 2c) or one four-gluon vertex (ﬁg. 2d). These diagrams become more and
more IR divergent when the gluon propagators are Taylor-expanded with respect to the
external momenta. The evaluation of the class ii) diagrams is obtained by supplementing
the Taylor-expanded result by the exact computation of their IR divergent contribution.6
The IR-divergent part of any diagram is constructed by a repeated application of the
identity in eq. (3.1) of ref. [60] controlled by the power counting in the IR-divergent terms.
The outcome of the procedure is that the IR-divergent part of any diagram is expressed
in terms of products of one-loop integrals with numerators that contain terms of the form
(ki·qj)m (k1·k2)n (i = 1, 2 , j = 1, 2, 3) where m, n are generic powers. Finally, the Passarino-
Veltman reduction method is applied to eliminate the numerators and express the result in
terms of the known one-loop scalar integrals [57].

Employing the method described in sect. 4 we obtained the large top-mass expansion
of the two-loop spin-0 and spin-2 form factors up to and including terms O(1/m8
t ). The
results are presented in appendix 1. As in the one-loop case the form factors are expressed
in terms of ˆs, p2
t . The computation was performed ﬁrst using orthogonal
projectors in nd = 4 − 2  dimension (see eqs. (7,8)) and then using orthogonal projectors
in nd = 4 dimension. We found that, after the addition of the counterterm pieces from
eq. (31), the two results are identical. We checked that, once the IR counterterm is chosen
as in eq. (31), F 2(cid:96)
reproduces the result for the triangle form factor that can be obtained
directly adapting the known results on single Higgs production (cfr. eq. (A2) with ref. [32]).
Finally, we want to comment on the comparison of our results with the ones of refs. [45,
46]. These references deal with the large top-mass evaluation of the NLO cross section
while we concentrated only on the virtual corrections. We use a diﬀerent method for
the asymptotic expansion compared to refs. [45, 46].
Instead of adding subgraphs and
co-subgraphs we followed ref. [60], where we only add the IR divergent parts, evaluated
fully, to the diagrams that exhibit IR divergencies. We work at the level of amplitudes
while in ref. [45] the total cross section is computed by deriving the imaginary part of the
gg → gg amplitude and connecting it via the optical theorem to the total cross section.7 In
refs. [45,46] the phase space integrals are computed analytically which requires an expansion
in δ = 1 − 4 m2
H/ˆs including the s-channel Higgs propagator in the triangle contributions.
The result is then expressed as an expansion both in ρ = m2
t and δ. Our approach
is instead to compute the phase space integrals numerically via Monte Carlo methods.
Performing a Monte Carlo integration of the phase space integrals will allow us in future
to include expansions in other regimes or exact results, once available, in a straightforward
way. We remark that the integration over ˆt in eq. (13) of the expanded form factors can
be easily done analytically as the latter are given as power series in ˆt. A precise numerical
comparison with refs. [45, 46] cannot be performed, since we did not compute the real
radiation part of the gg amplitude.

double-triangle contribution to the partonic cross section by ∼ 20 − 30%. We remark that

Indeed, it amounts to ∼ −0.18 fb while the NLO cross section is around 40 fb.

the expression
for the two-loop form factor we derived (eqs. (A1-A6)) to the relevant order n. Comparing
the LET row with the 1/m8
t one, we ﬁnd that the mass eﬀects induce a relative variation
with respect to the mt → ∞ result up to ∼ 40%.
Based on the experience gained in single Higgs production one expects that the fac-
torization of the exact LO cross section can improve the mt → ∞ determination of the
hadronic cross section. Applying the same procedure to a large mass expansion determi-
nation amounts to evaluate σ(0) CNLO employing for σ(0) the exact LO cross section while
evaluating CNLO at the same order of approximation both in the numerator and in the de-
nominator. The contribution to the hadronic cross section of σ0CNLO computed factorizing
the exact LO cross section is presented in table 3. Looking at tables 2 and 3 we notice
that the factorization of the exact LO cross section in the mt → ∞ result has the tendency
to overestimate the NLO cross section as approximated by the 1/m8
t rows in the tables.
Both tables show in the ﬁrst two columns a good convergence with respect to the order of

compensations between the two energy regions are not going to happen. Comparing the
ﬁrst row in table 3 with the last one in table 2 we ﬁnd a relative variation ∼ 20%. We
notice that the contribution of σ0CNLO to the NLO cross section is about 10% of the total,
that the contributions we did not discuss, i.e. Rgg, Rq ¯q and Rqg, when evaluated in the
limit of vanishing external momenta contribute to the total NLO cross section by ∼ 2%
and that, according to the analysis in refs. [43, 44], the ﬁnite mass eﬀects reduce the size
of the real contributions with respect their LET estimate. Considering a maximal case we
expect that mass eﬀects are going to reduce the mt → ∞ value of the NLO cross section
by less than 10%. This size of variation is indeed found if one compares the NLO cross

Finally we comment on larger hadronic center-of-mass energies. At LO, the LET result,
e.g. at
s = 14 TeV. Even though
a large center-of-mass energy gives a stronger weight to the region where the approximation
of large top mass is not valid, we can expect that our conclusion on the uncertainty on the
hadronic cross section due to mass eﬀects is not going to change signiﬁcantly, since the
parts of the NLO cross section that are actually mass dependent are small.

6 Conclusions

In this paper we computed the virtual NLO QCD corrections in Higgs pair production.
The double-triangle contribution was computed exactly while the spin-0 and spin-2 two-
loop form factors in the amplitude were computed via an asymptotic expansion in the

Our analysis diﬀers in several points from previous works in the literature [45, 46]. The
main diﬀerences are: i) we performed the asymptotic expansion at the level of form factors
and not of the cross section as in refs. [45, 46]. ii) We did not discuss the real contributions

14

as instead was done in those works. Point i) allowed us to compute the virtual NLO
contribution as in eq. (32) without making use of the factorization of the exact LO cross
section neither at the partonic level for the total cross section as in ref. [45] nor at the
level of diﬀerential factorization, i.e. before the integration over the Higgs pair invariant
mass, as in ref. [46]. The factorization of the LO cross section is known to work ﬁne in
single Higgs production where the exact NLO result is known [29–32], however there is no
proof that the same happens also in double Higgs production. From the comparison of
table 2 and table 3 in section 5 it seems that the diﬀerential factorization, that is expected
to lead to a better result than the other possibility since it gives rise to a better-behaved
integrand [46], when the LET result is employed tends to overestimate the result. Although
a detail comparison of our results with those of refs. [45, 46] is not possible, we notice that
our results in table 2 and 3 exhibit the same behavior with respect to the order of the
expansion of the soft-virtual cross section of ref. [46].

Finally, we would like to point out that our work should be seen as one of the ﬁrst steps
towards a complete calculation of the two-loop virtual corrections in Higgs pair production.
A complete calculation of the NLO corrections, requires to address, besides the real contri-
butions that were studied in refs. [43, 44], the computation of the virtual corrections in the
ˆs (cid:38) 400 GeV. These corrections are very diﬃcult to compute but can be
energy region
attacked either via a large momentum expansion calculation or by numerical methods.
