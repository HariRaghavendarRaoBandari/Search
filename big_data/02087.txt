ABSTRACT
We investigate the prospect of constraining scalar ﬁeld dark energy models using HI 21-cm in-
tensity mapping surveys. We consider a wide class of coupled scalar ﬁeld dark energy models
whose predictions about the background cosmological evolution are different from the ΛCDM
predictions by a few percent. We ﬁnd that these models can be statistically distinguished from
ΛCDM through their imprint on the 21-cm angular power spectrum. At the ﬁducial z = 1.5,
corresponding to a radio interferometric observation of the post-reionization HI 21 cm ob-
servation at frequency 568MHz, these models can infact be distinguished from the ΛCDM
model at SNR > 3σ level using a 10,000 hr radio observation distributed over 40 pointings
of a SKA1-mid like radio-telescope. We also show that tracker models are more likely to be
ruled out in comparison with ΛCDM than the thawer models. Future radio observations can
be instrumental in obtaining tighter constraints on the parameter space of dark energy models
and supplement the bounds obtained from background studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

The latest observational data give compelling evidence about the presence of an unknown dark component with negative pressure in the
universe (Betoule et al. 2014; Planck Collaboration et al. 2014; Sánchez 2012). The contribution of this unknown component, commonly
termed as dark energy (Sahni & Starobinsky 2000; Peebles & Ratra 2003; Padmanabhan 2003; Copeland et al. 2006; Sahni 2002), is around
70% of the total energy budget of the universe. The presence of such a large unknown component in the universe whose origin and nature is
still unexplained, is a major embarrassment for cosmologist. Understandably all the future cosmological observations have a common goal:
to know the nature of dark energy.

Cosmological constant (with an equation of state w = −1) as proposed by Einstein himself to obtain a static universe, is the simplest
explanation for the mysterious dark energy, given the fact that a ﬂat ΛCDM universe agrees exceptionally well to all the observational data
till date (See also (Delubac et al. 2015; Sahni et al. 2014; Trøst Nielsen et al. 2015; Di Valentino et al. 2016) for some recent contradiction).
However, the problem of extreme ﬁne tuning for the value of cosmological constant as well as the cosmic coincidence problem, have inspired
researchers to explore beyond the cosmological constant and study models where dark energy evolves with cosmological evolution.

The natural alternative to cosmological constant is the quintessence scenario (Ratra & Peebles 1988; Caldwell et al. 1998; Liddle & Scherrer

1999; Steinhardt et al. 1999; Scherrer & Sen 2008) where a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld with canonical kinetic term rolling over a suf-
ﬁciently ﬂat potential around present time, can mimic a time varying cosmological constant. Although, one still needs to do the required
ﬁne tuning, one can at least evade the cosmic coincidence problem in such a scenario. Various alternatives of quintessence models such
as k-essence (Chiba et al. 2000; Armendariz-Picon et al. 2000, 2001; Chiba 2002; Chimento & Feinstein 2004; Scherrer 2004; Sahni & Sen
2015; Li & Scherrer 2016), tachyons (Bagla et al. 2003; Sen 2006; Chimento 2004; Ali et al. 2009), non-minimally coupled scalar ﬁelds
(Bertolami & Martins 2000; Torres 2002; Sen & Sen 2001; Sen et al. 2009), and chameleon ﬁelds (Khoury & Weltman 2004; Wei & Cai
2005; Das & Banerjee 2008) have also been widely studied in recent past. A number of phenomenological potentials have been considered

for quintessence ﬁeld to achieve w ≈ −1 in such a scenario and in all these models, the ﬁeld has to slow-roll around present epoch. This sets
the mass of the scalar ﬁeld to be order of 10−33 eV. Such a small mass is always prone to get correction from various symmetry breakings
thereby spoiling the slow roll conditions for the ﬁeld. Given the known hierarchy problem in the standard model, it is extremely difﬁcult to
prevent the small mass of the scalar ﬁeld to get correction upto the supersymmetry breaking (SUSY) scale.

This problem has been addressed in the context of string theory by Panda et al. (Panda et al. 2011) ( from now on we refer this model
as PST model) using the idea of axion monodromy in Type-II B string theory. The resulting potential is a simple linear potential and the
construction is such that the potential does not get correction upto SUSY breaking scale as the ﬁeld does not couple to any standard model
sector ﬁeld ( for details about PST model, please see Panda et al. (2011)). However, there is no mechanism to prevent the quintessence ﬁeld
to couple with dark matter (DM) sector which according to the present understanding, has origin in beyond standard model (BSM) physics.
Coupled quintessence models where the scalar ﬁeld is only coupled to DM have been studied in different contexts starting from
background evolution to linear and nonlinear structure formation (Amendola 2000; Koivisto 2005; Lee et al. 2006; Saracco et al. 2010;
Amendola et al. 2014). Due to the absence of coupling to the baryonic sector, one can avoid the stringent constraints from local physics. In
most coupled quintessence scenario, the potentials for scalar ﬁeld were phenomenological and tracker type. For PST model we have a thaw-
ing scalar ﬁeld (similar to inﬂaton) with a linear potential that is not phenomenological but arises out of the construction of the model itself.
The avoidance of coupling with the baryonic sector also happens naturally in this set up. The only phenomenological aspect in this scenario
is the form of the coupling due to our lack of complete understanding about the origin of dark matter. In recent past, coupled quintessence
model in the PST scenario has been confronted with the latest observational data by Kumar et al (Kumar et al. 2013). It has been shown
that with the current precision of various observations, a large class of coupled quintessence behaviour is still indistinguishable from the
concordance ΛCDM model.

The three dimensional tomographic mapping of the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution is a powerful probe to understand large scale struc-
ture formation in the post reionization era (Bharadwaj et al. 2001; Wyithe & Loeb 2009). The epoch of reionization was completed by redshift
z ∼ 6 (Becker et al. 2001; Fan et al. 2002). After this, most of the remnant neutral gas is contained in the self shielded Damped Ly-α (DLA)
systems (Wolfe et al. 2005). These are supposedly the primary cosmological source of HI 21-cm signal (Furlanetto et al. 2006). The detection
of the individual DLA clouds is technically very challenging due to their small size and weakness of the signal ( < 10µJy). But the collective
diffuse HI 21-cm radiation from all the clouds without resolving the individual DLAs is expected to form a background in radio observations
at frequencies < 1420MHz. Intensity mapping of this background radiation can yield enormous cosmological information regarding the
background evolution of the Universe as well as the structure formation in the post-reionization epoch (Wyithe & Loeb 2007; Visbal et al.
2009; Wyithe et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2008; Bharadwaj et al. 2009; Mao et al. 2008; Wyithe 2008; Bull et al. 2015; Guha Sarkar & Datta
2015). The upcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA) in various phases has a dominant science goal of mapping out the large scale dis-
tribution of neutral hydrogen over a wide range of redshifts. Imaging of the Universe using the redshifted 21-cm signal from redshifts
z ≤ 6 (Wyithe & Loeb 2007; Bharadwaj et al. 2001; Wyithe & Loeb 2009) will open new avenues towards our understanding of cosmology
(Loeb & Wyithe 2008; Wyithe & Loeb 2008; Visbal et al. 2009; Wyithe et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2008; Bharadwaj et al. 2009). The large
scale clustering of the HI in the post-reionization epoch shall directly probe the nature of dark energy through the imprints of a given model
on the background evolution and growth of structures. As a direct probe of cosmological structure formation, 21-cm intensity mapping may
allow us to distinguish between dark energy models which are otherwise degenerate at the level of their prediction of background evolution.
In this paper, we study the prospects of probing coupled quintessence models using the HI intensity mapping in the context of forthcom-
ing SKA observations. In addition to the PST model described above, we also consider other phenomenological potentials that have been
considered in the literature. This gives a detail analysis on future constraints on coupled quintessence models in the context of observations
from HI 21-cm intensity mapping. We concentrate on the thawing class of scalar ﬁeld models ( recent discussions argued that these are
more favored than the tracking ones (Linder 2015) ). But to make the investigation complete, we also consider one particular parametrization
(called GCG parametrization) (Thakur et al. 2012) that broadly described both the thawing and tracker models and study the prospects of
distinguishing these two behaviours using the HI intensity mapping survey by SKA. We also study the clustering on superhorizon scales
where we can no longer ignore the scalar ﬁeld ﬂuctuations.

2 BACKGROUND EVOLUTION WITH SCALAR FIELD COUPLED WITH DM

We start with a general interacting picture where the DE scalar ﬁeld is coupledto the DM sector of the Universe. The visible matter sec-
tor (baryons) is not coupled with the DE scalar ﬁeld. There has been numerous studies in the literature on such “Coupled Quintessence"
(Amendola 2000, 2004) models. Here we also follow the same formalism. The relevant equations are given below:

H 2 =

Here C(φ) represents coupling parameter between the scalar ﬁeld and dark matter. Subscript “d" represents the DM sector and subscript “b"
represents the baryonic sector. The details of the physics for the interaction between the dark energy and the dark matter is largely unknown.
In view of this, we assume phenomenologically C(φ) to be a constant in our subsequent calculations. This is similar to the earlier work by
Amendola (Amendola 2000, 2004) and collaborators on coupled quintessence. For C = 0 we recover the uncoupled case,hence the system
allows us to study both coupled and uncoupled cases.

Next, we construct the following dimensionless variables:

Γ =

Note that the parameter Γ is related to the form of the potentials in our model. For the PST model described in the introduction, the potential
is linear, hence Γ vanishes. For completeness, we also consider other power-law potentials of the form V (φ) ∝ φn where Γ = (n − 1)/n.

The density parameter Ωφ and the equation of state for the scalar ﬁeld wφ can be written in terms of x and y as:

With this, one can form an autonomous system of equations:

Ωφ =x2 + y2

γ =1 + wφ =

κ . We evolve the above system of equations from the decoupling era (a = 10−3) to the present day (a = 1). We need to ﬁx the
where W = C
initial conditions for γ, Ωφ z and λ to solve the system of equations. For thawing models, scalar ﬁeld is initially frozen due to large Hubble
damping, and this ﬁxes the initial condition γi ≈ 0. The initial value λi is a model parameter; for smaller λi, the equation of state wφ for
the scalar ﬁeld always remain close to cosmological constant w = −1 whereas for larger values of λi, wφ increases from −1 as the universe
evolves. The contribution of scalar ﬁeld to the total energy density is negligibly small in the early universe (except for early dark energy
models that we are not considering in this study). But we need to ﬁne tune it initially in order to obtain a correct value of Ωφ at present. This
ﬁxes the initial condition for Ωφi. Similarly, we need to ﬁx the initial value of s ( which is related to the density parameter for baryons) to
get right value of the Ωb at the present epoch. In our subsequent calculations we ﬁx Ωb0 = 0.05.

3 GROWTH OF MATTER FLUCTUATIONS IN THE LINEAR REGIME

We next study the growth of matter ﬂuctuations in the linear regime. Here matter consists of both dark matter and baryons; but in the
late universe ( which is the time period we are interested in), the dark matter perturbation is dominant and baryons follow the dark matter
perturbation. Hence we ignore the baryonic contribution in our calculations. We should stress that even if we include the baryon contribution
(which is very straightforward to do), our results do not change. We work in the longitudinal gauge:

ds2 = a2h−(1 + 2Φ)dτ 2 + (1 − 2Ψ)dxidxii ,

where τ is the conformal time and Φ and Ψ are the two gravitational potentials. In the absence of any anisotropic stress Φ = Ψ. We follow
the prescription by Amendola (Amendola 2000, 2004) and write the equations for the perturbations in dark matter density in the Newtonian
limit. This is valid assumption for sub horizon scales. In these scales, one can safely ignore the clustering in the scalar ﬁeld. Under these
assumptions, the linearized equations governing the growth of ﬂuctuations in dark matter is given by:

decoupling a ∼ 10−3. This is valid since the universe is matter-dominated at the epoch of decoupling. We take the Fourier transform of the
above equation and deﬁne the linear growth function Dd and the linear growth rate fd as

4 THE REDSHIFTED 21 CM SIGNAL FROM THE POST-REIONIZATION EPOCH

The neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution in post-reionization epoch is modeled by a mean neutral fraction ¯xHI which remains constant over a
wide redshift range z ≤ 6 (Storrie-Lombardi et al. 1996; P’eroux et al. 2003) and a linear bias parameter bT which relates the HI ﬂuctuations
to the ﬂuctuations in the underlying dark matter distributions (Bagla et al. 2010; Guha Sarkar et al. 2012). The quantity of interest is the
ﬂuctuation of the excess HI 21 cm brightness temperature δTb. Denoting the comoving distance to the redshift z by r we have δTb given by
a ﬂuctuation ﬁeld on the sky corresponding to radial and angular coordinates (z, rˆn) as δTb = ¯T (z) × ηHI(rˆn) (Bharadwaj & Ali 2004)
where,

and

ηHI (r ˆn, z) = ¯xHI (z)(cid:20)δHI(z, ˆn) −

Here, δH denotes the HI ﬂuctuations and v denotes the peculiar velocity of the gas. If ∆(k, z) and ∆H(k, z) denote dark matter overdensity
δd and δH respectively in Fourier space then they are related by a bias function bT (k, z) as ∆H (k, z) = bT (k, z)∆(k, z). On large scales
of our interest, the bias is found to be a constant in numerical simulations of the post-reionization HI signal (Guha Sarkar et al. 2012). We
use a linear bias model in this analysis. If the peculiar velocities of the gas are sourced by dark matter over densities then the angular power
spectrum of the brightness temperature in the ﬂat sky limit is given by (Datta et al. 2007)

(15)

where P (k, z) is the dark matter power spectrum deﬁned in equation (12), k =qk2
with fd(z) is the growth
factor for dark matter deﬁned in equation (11). We note that the redshift dependent quantities ¯T , and r are directly related to the background
cosmology and β and P (k, z) imprint both background history and structure formation. We adopt the value of ΩHI = 10−3 at z < 3.5.
This yields ¯xHI = 2.45 × 10−2 (Storrie-Lombardi et al. 1996) which is assumed to be constant across the redshift range of our interest.
We consider a radio interferometric measurement of the power spectrum of the 21 cm brightness temperature. The directly measured
’Visibility’ is a function of frequency ν and baseline U = k⊥r/2π and allows us to compute the angular power spectrum Cl directly using
Visibility-Visibility correlation (Bharadwaj & Ali 2005) with the association l = 2πU.

We consider a radio interferometer with parameters roughly following the speciﬁcations of SKA1-mid 1. The ﬁducial redshift z = 1.5
corresponds to an observing frequency of 568MHz which falls in the band of frequencies to be probed by SKA1-mid. We consider a
frequency bandwidth of 32MHz around the central frequency. The array is assumed to be composed of 200 dishes each of diameter 15m.

5 RESULTS

In ﬁgure 1 (left), we plot the evolution of Hubble parameter H(z) with redshift for different combinations of W and λi and also for ΛCDM
for the PST model with linear potential. Remember W parameter determines the strength of the coupling and λi determines the deviation
from the cosmological constant. We choose the combinations ( mentioned in ﬁgure 1) so that the deviation from ΛCDM is very small and
in actual it is around 3 − 4% or less upto a redshift z = 1.5. This is much smaller than the current error bar in the measurement of H(z) at
different redshift.
The fact that the models are statistically indistinguishable at the level of their predictions about background evolution, prompts us to
investigate their signature in structure formation. The imprint of the dark energy model on the 21-cm angular power spectrum is not only
through the background model contained in H(z) and r, but also through the manner in which they affect the growth of structures and
thereby affecting the matter power spectrum. We consider a 10, 000 hrs radio observation of the 21-cm signal using a SKA1-mid like radio
telescope where the total observation time t0 is distributed over 40 radio pointings of individual 250hrs observation. The power spectrum is
binned over l with ∆l = l/5. The noise level shows a steep rise at low multipoles owing to cosmic variance and also at large multipoles due
to dominant instrument noise. In ﬁgure 1 (right), we show the deviation of the dark energy models models from ΛCDM universe in terms
of the angular power spectra for HI intensity mapping. It is clearly visible that most of these models can be ruled out in comparison with
ΛCDM model with future SKA1-mid data in an intermediate multipole region around l ∼ 7000 at a 3σ to 5σ conﬁdence level.
In ﬁgure 2 and 3, we plot the same but for scalar ﬁeld potentials V ∼ φ−2 and V ∼ φ2. One can see, in these cases the conﬁdence level
at which one can distinguish these models with ΛCDM, decrease slightly but still one can distinguish them from ΛCDM at 3σ conﬁdence
level or more. Note that we choose combinations of parameters W and λi for which the Hubble parameter deviates from ΛCDM value by
3 − 4% which is very conservative choice. Current data allows bigger deviations from ΛCDM value. In such cases, the deviation in Cl from
ΛCDM predictions should be certainly distinguished with larger conﬁdence level with future SKA1-mid data.
Also if we put W = 0 in all these cases, the fractional difference with ΛCDM will be much less than the error bar and can not be

distinguished at all from ΛCDM with future survey like SKA1-mid.

6 THAWING VS TRACKER

In the previous sections, we consider scalar ﬁeld models which are thawer in nature. In such models, the scalar ﬁeld is initially frozen due
to large hubble damping and the equation of state of the scalar ﬁeld is very close to −1. As the universe evolves, hubble damping decreases
and the scalar ﬁeld slowly thaws away from the frozen state and the equation of state of the scalar ﬁeld slowly increase towards w > −1.
There is another class of models, known as the tracker models where initially the scalar ﬁeld fast rolls due to the steep nature of the potential
and mimics the background matter density (w ∼ 0). In late times, the scalar ﬁeld potential ﬂattens up and the scalar ﬁeld ﬁnally freezes
to w ∼ −1 behaviour. Although a variety of potentials can give rise to both thawer and tracker potentials, it may be useful to have simple
parametrization for the equation of state of the scalar ﬁeld that broadly describes these two behaviours. The generalized chaplygin gas (GCG)
equation of state described by p = −A/ρα where A and α are two constant parameters, is useful for this purpose (Thakur et al. 2012). For
such a parametrization the dark energy equation of state is given by

wde = −

As + (1 − As)a−3(1+α) ,

As

where As = ρde0/A1+α. It is straightforward to check that for (1 + α) < 0, wde behaves like thawer model while for (1 + α) > 0, wde
behaves like tracker model. The parameter As is related to the current value of the equation of state for the dark energy, As = −wde0. In
ﬁgure 4, we show these two behaviours.
With this, we investigate whether one can distinguish these two behaviours from ΛCDM using the future SKA data. We concentrate on
the uncoupled case where the dark energy is not coupled with the dark matter and follow the same procedure as described in section 3 and 5.
The result is shown in ﬁgure 5.

The result for the thawer model is consistent with our previous observation in section 5 that without interaction with DM (W = 0), the

7 FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SUPER-HORIZON SCALES

In the previous sections, we study the dark matter density perturbation for quintessence models in the sub-horizon scales where we ignored
the perturbations in the dark energy scalar ﬁeld and concentrate in the Newtonian limit. We show that it will be possible to distinguish these
scalar ﬁeld models from ΛCDM specially for coupled scenario using the observations of angular power spectra from HI 21-cm mapping
survey like SKA-mid. In this section, we study how these models deviate from ΛCDM at super-horizon scales. On such scales, we can not
ignore the perturbations in the scalar ﬁeld for dark energy and also one has to do the full relativistic perturbation. Such study has been done
by various authors in recent past. Here we speciﬁcally concentrate on the coupled quintessence of thawer class with linear potentials as
constructed in the PST model. It can be straightforwardly generalized for any other scalar ﬁeld potentials.

For this purpose we follow the set up as provided by Unnikrishnan et al (Unnikrishnan et al. 2008). We work in the longitudinal
gauge as described by the metric in equation (8) with Φ = Ψ for vanishing anisotropic stress. The perturbed Einstein equations are given
δGµν = δTµν, where δTµν contains both the pertubations in the matter part as well as in the scalar ﬁeld part. These are complimented by
the equations arising from the Bianchi identity T µ
ν contains the unpertubed part as well as the pertubed part from the matter
and scalar ﬁeld. We refer the reader (Unnikrishnan et al. 2008) for the detail calculations. We generalize the results in (Unnikrishnan et al.
2008) for the coupled scenario. The ﬁnal relevant equations are given by:

ν;µ = 0 where T µ

coupled scenario as we take into account the perturbations of the scalar ﬁeld. On smaller scales (increasing k), however, the effect of scalar
ﬁeld perturbation becomes negligible. One should note here, that observing large scale effect of the scalar ﬁeld dark energy perturbation is
difﬁcult due to large cosmic variance. It is possible, in principle to detect the imprint of such large scale effects by considering a full sky
21-cm survey covering a large band in say 0.5 < z < 3 and collapsing all the multipoles in an experiment where instrumental noise is made
to go below the cosmic variance level. Large survey volumes may in future allow us to detect the imprints of clustering dark energy using the
maximally available tomographic 21-cm data.

8 DISCUSSIONS

The large scale clustering of the neutral hydrogen in the post reionization era contains a lot of information about our universe for both
the background evolution as well as formation of large scale structures. Hence it is a natural probe for dark energy behaviour. In this
paper we study the prospects of probing a large class of scalar ﬁeld dark energy models using angular power spectra for the HI 21-cm
intensity mapping from future SKA like instruments. Several observational challenges poses serious difﬁculties towards the detection of the
cosmological redshifted 21-cm signal. Astrophysical foregrounds from galactic and extra galactic sources are several orders of magnitude
larger than the signal (Ghosh et al. 2011) and signiﬁcant amount of foreground subtraction is required for a statistical detection of the signal
(Di Matteo et al. 2002; Santos et al. 2005; Gleser et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Ghosh et al. 2011; Alonso et al. 2015). The cross correlation
of the redshifted 21 cm signal with other cosmological probes like the Lyman-alpha forest and Lyman-Break galaxies, has been proposed
(Guha Sarkar et al. 2011; Guha Sarkar & Datta 2015; Villaescusa-Navarro et al. 2015) to cope with the effect of foreground residuals. Further
man made Radio frequency interferences and other systematic effects like calibration errors shall also have to be tackled before obtaining the
pristine cosmological signal.

In this work we have considered thawing class of coupled quintessence models with different potentials including that constructed in a
string theory set up in the PST model. The equations are constructed in such a way that one can easily switch off the interaction term and
study the uncoupled case as well. We show that models which deviate from the ΛCDM universe at 3− 4% level and can not be distinguished
by current observations, can be easily be ruled out in comparison with ΛCDM model in an multipole region l ∼ 7000 with 3− 5σ conﬁdence
level which is very encouraging. But with the anticipated error bar for SKA1-mid, it will still not be possible to distinguish the uncoupled
models from ΛCDM. Large survey volumes in future however may allow a possible detection.

Although our analysis focuses primarily on the thawing class of scalar ﬁeld models, tracker class of models is another possibility. To
distinguish between these classes of models without considering individual potentials, we consider the GCG equation of state which broadly
describe both the models for different parameter ranges. With this, we compare the thawing and tracking class of models for the uncoupled
case and show that tracker models can be easily ruled with very high conﬁdence level in comparison with both ΛCDM as well as thawing
models. The same is true for coupled tracking model although we do not show it explicitly.

In the end, we have studied the deviations of the coupled quintessence model from ΛCDM on very large scales where one can no longer
ignore the perturbations in the scalar ﬁeld as well as one has to consider the full relativistic calculations. We show that there is substantial
deviation from ΛCDM on large scales for coupled quintessence. But limitation due to cosmic variance on large scales is a problem to probe
these deviation. Future tomographic 21-cm data with large survey volume may be useful to probe dark energy on these scales.
