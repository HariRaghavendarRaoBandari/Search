(Dated: March 23, 2016)

In the literature, the standard method of enumerating the groundstates of superconductors is by con-
structing an appropriate algebra of unitary operators on the groundstate subspace. Here, we explore
an alternative route to topological degeneracy in superconductors, by examining Taubes’s Vortices
and Monopoles, and extracting topological degeneracy as a topological factor arising from restricting
to gauge-transformations of electrons. This variational argument is conjectured by Oshikawa to be
equivalent mathematically to the traditional braiding argument. We make signiﬁcant headway in
proving this equivalence in sections III and IV.

Advised by Cliﬀord Taubes, Professor of Mathematics at Harvard
University.

One of the hallmarks of a topological phase of matter
is a marked dependence of the number of groundstates
on the topology of the system. Superconductors share
this property, in that the groundstate degeneracy of a
superconductor shaped like a manifold M is a topologi-
cal invariant of M [3].

In this paper, the argument is purely classical: we
minimize the zero-temperature free-energy density, and
count the number of solutions modulo gauge transfor-
mations. The approach is not new, and Read and Green
outline the strategy of proof brieﬂy in Paired States of
Fermions (2000) for the case of Riemann surfaces.

In this paper, we generalize Read and Green’s pro-
gram to n-dimensional manifolds, and also allow
for non-trivial geometry of the bundle containing
the order-parameter. All of this is made possible by
Taubes’s PhD thesis Vortices and Monopoles, which
represented a signiﬁcant advance in geometric analysis
when it was released over 35 years ago.

In principle, our arguments are powerful enough to
compute the groundstate degeneracy of the Ginzburg-
Landau model with a non-abelian gauge group G, by
computing the appropriate sheaf cohomology.

Read and Green, in Paired States of Fermions, outlined
a new way of obtaining the groundstate degeneracy of
superconductors, based oﬀ of counting the minimizers
the zero-temperature free-energy density:

Conjecture II.1 The groundstate degeneracy of
the
Ginzburg-Landau eﬀective ﬁeld theory is equal to the
number of distinct minimizers of the zero-temperature
Ginzburg-Landau free-energy (see Appendix for deﬁni-
tions).

Read and Green, using this conjecture, exactly
matched the groundstate degeneracy as rigorously
calculated by Oshikawa and Senthil in the case of a
Riemann surface (in [14]).

In this paper, we will see that this conjecture holds
in even the most general cases. That the classical
arguments of Read and Green reproduce quantum phe-
nomena such as groundstate degeneracy is a fascinating
peculiarity of mean ﬁeld theory.

A proof of Conjecture II.1 would be fundamental
in demonstrating the equivalence between Oshikawa
and Senthil’s braiding arguments and Read and Green’s
variational arguments, and must be proven rigorously.
Such work will form a dictionary in condensed matter
physics between equivalent descriptions of topologi-
cal phases.

The next two sections cover a wide swath of pertur-
bative quantum ﬁeld theory. Although we are not able
to provide the equivalence in this paper, we deﬁnitely
make signiﬁcant headway, an eﬀort that will most cer-
tainly be completed in forthcoming work.

NON-INTERACTING QUANTUM FIELD

THEORIES

Here, we give our best attempt at reconstructing the
braiding arguments in [4].
In order to connect them
to the variational argument, we will need to investigate
Wilsonian RG ﬂow in the Hamiltonian picture. This sec-
tion represents the current state of that research eﬀort:

A.

Non-interacting Systems

This subsection establishes the fundamental building
blocks of quantum many-body theory: it examines the
mathematics of non-interacting systems. This exposi-
tion precisely deﬁnes, mathematically, what the word
"non-interacting" means, by explicitly characterizing
the time-evolution of non-interacting systems (This is

Finally, we classify all non-interacting dynamics
by passing to the single-particle dynamics (This is
Corollary 1.2). At the end, we apply our results to
unpack the physics behind the hopping hamiltonian,
and other common toy models in condensed matter
physics. Finally, I would like to mention that the ideas
in this article were inspired by the ﬁrst few pages of
Operator Algebras and Quantum Statistical Mechanics,
Vol II:

http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662090893.

B.

The Exterior and Tensor Algebras

In order to understand what I mean, let’s ﬁrst intro-
duce some language. A possible conﬁguration for a sys-
tem of identical fermions is a formal linear combination
of symbols

f1 ∧···∧ fk

where each fi represents a possible conﬁguration of a
single fermion. These are called single-particle states,
and lie in some Hilbert space h, which denotes the con-
ﬁguration space of a single fermion. We then let
Λk(h) := {span of f1 ∧··· fk | fi a single-particle state}
which reads as "the kth exterior power of h". We can then
string together the exterior powers of a ﬁxed Hilbert
space to form the exterior algebra

Λ(h) := ⊕k≥0Λk(h).

Alternating tensors are incredibly hard to perform
computations with, because they have implicit sums
over the entire symmetric group on k-letters, which
has k! terms. Multiplying tensors only multiplies the
complexity.

To stop the number of terms from growing out of con-
trol, physicists prefer to work in terms of an algebra gen-
erated by creation and annihilation operators, which
eﬀectively rewrites
f1 ∧···∧ fk

−−−−−−−−→ c

(f1)··· c

(fk) Ω

∗

∗

thus writing a typical k-particle state as a succession of
operators applied to the vacuum Ω ∈ Λ0(h). The anti-
symmetry of each state is then translated into the com-
mutation relations of the algebra, called the CAR rela-
tions for short. We then can generate a basis as follows:

Λ(h) = {span of Ω}⊕{span of c
⊕{span of c

∗
∗

(f )Ω}
∗
(f1)c

(f2)Ω}⊕···

Physicists will then like to discard the Hilbert space al-
together, and then talk solely about the CAR algebra on

we have not yet justiﬁed the name "non-interacting". we
will do that now:

Theorem III.1 (Classiﬁc. of Non-interacting Systems)
For (Λ(h), Aij) a general non-interacting system of identical
fermions, the time-evolution of any k-particle state factors
in the following manner:

ij Aij fi ⊗ f j is a single-particle Hamiltonian,
and the raised index indicates dualization. In other words, a
"non-interacting system of identical fermions" always fac-
tors into a set of identical, non-interacting, single-particle
systems, where the single-particle dynamics has the replace-
ments

Proof. It suﬃces to prove equation (1). We will use some
machinery for this:

Deﬁnition II.2 Given a unitary operator U deﬁned on
h, we deﬁne its second-quantization Γ (U) on a basis of
pure tensors by

Γ (U)(f1 ∧···∧ fk) := U f1 ∧···∧ U fk

Then we deﬁne the second quantization of a self-
adjoint operator H by the symbol dΓ (H), and on a basis
of pure tensors by

dΓ (H)(f1 ∧···∧ fk) :=

f1 ∧···∧ Hfi ∧···∧ fk

i=1

Having given the deﬁnitions, we can now prove the
theorem in two steps:

Step 1:

the ﬁrst step is to prove that Γ (eitH ) =
eitdΓ (H). By the strong-continuity of the single-particle
evolution, both are strongly continuous one-parameter
groups. Therefore, by Stone’s theorem, this reduces to
the following computational veriﬁcation:

-algebra, where the involution
operation is adjunction. Anyways, that was a rough in-
troduction to the language of many-body theory. We are
now ready to tackle quasiparticles:

C.

Non-interacting Fermions

Fundamental to the notion of quasiparticle is the
notion of particle. A system of identical noninter-
acting particles is completely tractable, and so many
techniques for solving complicated interacting systems
involve transforming the degrees of freedom into an
eﬀectively non-interacting theory. The non-interacting
particles in the eﬀective theory are then called quasi-
particles.

Deﬁnition II.1 A noninteracting system of fermions
is a quantum dynamical system along with the follow-
ing data:

(a) A single-particle Hilbert space h, for which the full
Hilbert space of the dynamical system is the exte-
rior algebra Λ(h) := ⊕n≥0 Λn(h).

Materials with well-deﬁned band structures are typical
examples of systems of non-interacting fermions. First
and foremost among these examples is the Lattice gas,
which is central in materials theory, because it describes
the motion of electrons in basic metals like copper and
tin:

Example 1.1 (One-dimensional Lattice Gas) The one-
dimensional lattice gas is a prime example of a system
of identical fermions, where the single particle Hilbert-
space is h = l2(Z). A general single-particle wave func-
tion is a linear combination of position eigenstates fi,
taking the value one at a single lattice point i, and zero
everywhere else. The Hamiltonian H is given by the for-
mula

H =

where t is a real number. This is commonly referred
to as a hopping Hamiltonian in the physics literature.
This is a noninteracting system of identical fermions,
because the Hamiltonian may be written as a non-
interacting Hamiltonian as follows:

there exists a basis of the single-particle Hilbert space with

Having completely classiﬁed and characterized non-
interacting systems, we know now that a generic band
Hamiltonian, instrumental in the invention of the tran-
sistor, and cutting-edge materials physics circa 1950, is
a non-interacting system of fermions, because we can
factor the Hamiltonian as follows:

This also shows that
be written quadratic in creation and annihilation
operators, corresponding to matrix elements of the
single-particle operator on the RHS.

Before going further, however, let’s unpack the phys-
ical meaning of the hopping Hamiltonian, by showing
that it actually factors into a discrete Laplacian, upon
passing to the single-particle dynamics:

Example 1.2 (Lattice Gas revisited) As in the proof
of Corollary 1.2, let’s factor the dynamics of the one-
dimensional lattice gas into independent, one-body dy-
namical systems as follows:

(cid:88)

We now examine the single-particle dynamics carefully.
The factored Hamiltonian H now has action (up to in-
sertion of 2tδij, which just shifts the spectrum by the
constant 2t):

(Hψ)i = t(ψi+1 + 2ψi + ψi−1).

If we suppose that the lattice spacing is one, we can
pass to the continuous limit by letting the spacing tend
to zero. In this case, we can compute the continuum
Hamiltonian ˜H, which the factored Hamiltonian H rep-
resents:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x

Thus completing our objective, which was to write a
non-interacting system in fully diagonalized form, with
respect to some basis {gi} of the single-particle Hilbert
space. (cid:3)

Therefore, we conclude that the hopping Hamiltonian,
plus a chemical potential of 2t, factors into a discretized
system of free fermions of mass 2t/2. Hence the name
"Lattice gas".
In ν-dimensions, this generalizes to a
traditional Fermi electron gas.

Let’s now revisit the Band Hamiltonian:

Example 1.3 (Band Hamiltonian) Now that we have
the Laplacian, we just need to add a potential en-
ergy term to our hopping Hamiltonian, and we’ll get

Despite being such a fundamental mathematical quan-
tity, surprisingly no one has actually computed the total
Green’s function for a many-body system.

In the case of a complicated interacting system, this
computation is intractable. However, we can give the
ﬁrst computations of this function in the case that the
dynamics is non-interacting. We can then compute the
total Green’s function of a general system via perturba-
tion theory, but we will leave that for another article.

Since our Hamiltonian is non-interacting, it sends
each k-particle portion of the total Hilbert space to it-
self: so the total Green’s function G also sends each k-
particle portion of its Hilbert space to itself:

With this, we have now ended our formal discussion of
non-interacting systems of identical particles.

ADDING INTERACTIONS: RENORMALIZATION
WITH THE TOTAL GREEN’S FUNCTION

We are now ready to start moving towards mean ﬁeld
theory, which will connect the arguments of Read and
Green with those of Oshikawa and Senthil: Following
[2], it would be nice to be able to deﬁne a family of ef-
fective Hamiltonians

{H eﬀ[Λ]}Λ≥0

at every energy-scale Λ, for a ﬁxed material, and for-
mulate a renormalization group ﬂow naturally in this
context, that can interpolate between between a micro-
scopic and eﬀective many-body theory. As it turns out,
the total Green’s function

Geﬀ[Λ] ≡ (∂t + iH eﬀ[Λ])
−1

is absolutely necessary to implement this program eﬃ-
ciently (See [1]). However, this puts us in an awkward
position, because such an object is foreign to the con-
densed matter literature.

A.

The Total Green’s Function Gk

Time-evolution of a many-body quantum system is
given by the time-dependent many-body Schrodinger
equation (in units where  = 1),

(∂t + iH)Ψ = 0.

The terms on the right-hand-side are the k-particle
Green’s functions. Therefore, to compute the total
Green’s function, it will suﬃce to compute Gk for all
k ≥ 0.

B.

Computation of G0 and G1

Note: For conceptual simplicity, throughout this
article, we will assume that the single-particle Hilbert
space is ﬁnite dimensional, with basis {fi}.
The ﬁrst two terms in the direct sum have already
been computed in the literature, and we will not waste
any time and just brieﬂy mention the results here:

The operator G1 is all over the many-body literature:
it is called "the propagator", or sometimes "the single-
particle Green’s function". It has the following matrix
elements:

Computation of G1 is usually given as a trivial exercise
in many-body textbooks, such as [3]. Already, with k =
0,1, we can see a pattern forming. We will extrapolate
to general values of k in the next section.

In this paper, we compute the Green’s function of the
linear diﬀerential equation above, which we’ll call the
total Green’s function of our many-body system:

G ≡ (∂t + iH)

THE BASICS OF THE VARIATIONAL ARGUMENT

Here in the second half of the thesis, we leave the
quantum eﬀort, and focus on our main result:
the
variational calculation of topological degeneracy of
superconductors on nontrivial bundles.

In this beginner’s section, we setup the structure
of classical abelian gauge theory, which will allow us
to precisely analyze the minimizers of the Ginzburg-
Landau free energy, and eventually vastly generalize
the powerful arguments of Read and Green in [2]. This
is the famous variational argument of Read and Green:
degeneracy via sheaf coholomogy.

A.

The Line bundle of Quantum Mechanics

In terms of modern physics, forces are measured by
parallel transport of physical ﬁelds along a small loop
on the space-time manifold. In terms of geometry, this
measures the curvature. Gauge theory realizes this fun-
damental principle. And a great way to motivate gauge
theory is to reformulate all of quantum mechanics in
terms of a complex line bundle:

Deﬁnition II.1 A complex line bundle over X is a
manifold L equipped with some additional structure,
namely, a surjective projection π : L → X, for which the
inverse images of points x ∈ X, called ﬁbres π
−1(x), are
all linearly isomorphic to C.

Moreover, we have the local triviality condition,
which is that, for U any open subset of X, we have a
diﬀeomorphism Φ : π

−1(U) → U × C satisfying
π1(Φ(X)) = π(X),

Where π1 is projection onto the ﬁrst factor. Finally, we
require that Φ restricts to a complex linear isomorphism
on ﬁbres.
A map s : X → L is called a cross-section of L,
provided that π◦ s = idX.
Example II.2.
[Wave functions] The space of wave
functions for a particle is linearly isomorphic to the
space of cross-sections of the complex line bundle R3×C
over three-dimensional space R3, with the obvious pro-
jection π1. Given a wave function ψ : R3 → C, associate
to it

˜ψ : R3 → R3 × C,

with ˜ψ() ≡ (, ψ()).
This is a section, because
π1( ˜ψ()) = π1(, ψ()) = .
It is easy to check that the
assignment ψ (cid:55)→ ˜ψ is a linear isomorphism, where the

So far, we discussed a linear isomorphism. To truly
do quantum mechanics in the setting of line bundles,
however, we’ll have to ﬁnd a line-bundle analogue of
the Hilbert space structure for our space of cross-
sections. Finally, we’ll show that our isomorphism is
unitary, in that it respects this additional structure.

Deﬁnition II.3 A hermitian structure on a complex
line bundle L is a choice of complex inner-product (·,·)x
on each ﬁbre π

−1(x), such that the assignment

x (cid:55)→ (·,·)x

inner-product (cid:104)ψ, ϕ(cid:105) ≡ (cid:82)

is smooth, as a map of bundles. A complex line bundle
L equipped with a hermitian structure is called a her-
mitian line bundle, and, given a riemmanian structure
on X, the space of square-integrable sections of the
line bundle can be made into a Hilbert space, with
X(ψ(x), ϕ(x))x ωg, where ωg is
the riemannian volume form.
The complex line bundle (R3 × C, π1) admits a hermi-
tian structure, given by

((, z),(, w)) ≡ z

∗

w.

We now show that the space of wave functions for a par-
ticle is unitarily isomorphic to the Hilbert-space of cross-
sections of the hermitian line bundle R3 × C, with the
aforementioned hermitian structure, via the linear iso-
morphism ψ (cid:55)→ ˜ψ discussed previously:
( ˜ψ(), ˜ϕ()) dx∧ dy ∧ dz
((, ψ()),(, ϕ())) dx∧ dy ∧ dz

Note that we are using the volume form dx ∧ dy ∧ dz
for the standard riemannian structure on R3. In con-
clusion, in the general case of a curved three-dimensional
space M, the Hilbert space of wave functions of a particle
moving on M is deﬁned as the space of cross-sections of
some hermitian line bundle L over M.

We’ll now talk about calculus on line-bundles: the
Hamiltonian is a linear diﬀerential operator on the
space of wave functions for a particle - what do diﬀer-
ential operators look like, in the setting of line bundles?

B.

Calculus on Line-bundles and the Emergence of

Gauge Theory

To do calculus on a ﬁbre-bundle, we must diﬀerenti-
ate its cross-sections. To diﬀerentiate a cross-section of

a ﬁbre bundle, one must have a notion of what it means
for a cross-section to be constant. On a manifestly triv-
ial line-bundle, such as R× C, or a trivial circle-bundle
S1 × S1, the constant cross-sections are obvious, and we
require no extra structure.

However, with a general line-bundle, with twists
and turns, we must draw gauges, that is, level curves,
which are reference cross-sections which we designate
as constant. This is where gauge-theory gets its name:
to diﬀerentiate a cross-section of a non-trivial ﬁbre
bundle, we have to draw reference gauges on the
bundle, just like a construction engineer needs a gauge
to tell if a table is level.
Example II.4 [Gauging R3 × C] For the space of wave
functions on three-dimensional euclidean space, there
is a natural notion of what it means for a cross-section
˜ψ : R3 → R3 × C to be constant.
In other words, a
standard gauge g would be of the form g() = (, z) for
some constant z ∈ C.

In general, for line-bundles, we impose the condition
that the system of gauges has to be scale-invariant,
that is, the set of gauges is closed under multiplying
each ﬁbre by the same complex-scalar. However, on a
hermitian line-bundle, the hermitian structure allows
us to set more precise level curves (physically, this is
supposed to be equivalent to an observer performing
measurements (i.e.
inner-products) on the quantum
mechanical system):

Deﬁnition II.5 A cross-section s0 of a hermitian line
bundle is called isometric, provided that it satisﬁes
(s0, s0) ≡ constant.
In quantum mechanics, where the hermitian struc-
ture of the line bundle is endowed by the Hilbert-space
structure, it is therefore natural to consider only iso-
metric, scale-invariant gauge systems. That is, draw
gauges which are isometric. For a cross-section with
varying norm is tautologically not constant.
Example II.6 [Isometric gauge for R3 × C] Recall that
the complex line bundle (R3 × C, π1) admits a standard
hermitian structure, given by ((, z),(, w)) ≡ z
w. For an
arbitrary cross-section, the isometric condition implies

∗

∗
that ((, ψ()),(, ψ())) = ψ()
that all isometric gauge systems are of the form

ψ() = constant, which implies

9

g() = (, βeiα())

for β, α as real numbers and real-valued functions
respectively.
In conclusion, even with the hermitian
structure, R3× C still admits an uncountable number of
isometric gauge systems.

Note:This is to be contrasted with general relativity,
where one can impose the extra condition of vanishing
torsion on an isometric gauge, making it unique. This is
behind the construction of the Levi-civita connection.
However, the gauge structure of a hermitian line bundle
is unrelated to the tangent structure of the base manifold.
So, in the setting of quantum mechanics, one cannot deﬁne
torsion in the ﬁrst place, and we are permanently left with
this gauge-freedom.

Once one has gauged a line-bundle,

it is easy to

diﬀerentiate its cross-sections.
Deﬁnition II.7 Let L → M be a complex line bundle,
and let γ be a path on M, with X ≡ γ
(0). The covariant
derivative of a cross-section ψ in the direction X, with
respect to a gauge system, is deﬁned as

(cid:48)

∇Xψ ≡ lim
t→0

ψ(γ(t))− Γ ψ(γ(0))

t

Where Γ denotes tracing the value ψ(γ(0)) along some
reference cross-section in the gauge system, to the ﬁ-
bre above γ(t), wherein the subtraction may then be
carried-out using the vector-space structure within the
ﬁbre. Exercise. Check that, tautologically,

∇Xg = 0

For any reference cross-section g in the gauge-system.
(They were supposed to be constant).

C.

Gauge Theory on a Riemann Surface

Considering the degeneracy of a superconductor on a
non-trivial line bundle (which happens in Section VII)
will force us to infuse the basic geometric foundation
of gauge theory with complex structure. After this sub-
section, we will leave with an even more sophisticated
understanding of gauge theory.

In brief, in gauge theory, we have the geometric prin-

ciple of

force = curvature.

In an abelian gauge theory, this principle is manifest
in the holomorphic structures of a ﬁxed topological

10

line bundle, each of which inﬂuence the dynamics of
sections of that bundle:

Proposition IV.1 (Abelian gauge theory in terms of
holomorphic structures) Let L → Σ be a hermitian line
bundle over a Riemann surface, and let A be the space of
unitary connections on L. Then

A/G (cid:27) {holomorphic structures on L}/G,

Where G is the action of the full group of GL-gauge trans-
formations of L.

D.

Ginzburg-Landau Theory on a Manifold M

To make this paper self-contained, we will precisely

deﬁne basic objects involved in Conjecture II.1:

In the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy, which is the fo-
cal point of our variational argument, there are two pa-
rameters: the order parameter ψ, which is a section of
a hermitian line bundle L, and the gauge ﬁeld A, de-
rived from a hermitian connection on the line bundle.
We now can deﬁne an operator

∇A := d − A.

Proof.

What the preceding proposition tells us is that, when
performing a gauge theory calculation, we can think
in terms of holomorphic line bundles modulo gauge
transformations, which invites the use of the tools of
complex geometry.

The space of all holomorphic line bundles over a
Riemann surface Σ, modulo gauge transformations, is
called the Picard group, and is denoted by the symbol
Pic(Σ).

Of course, in gauge theory, the smooth (topological)
structure is background and thus ﬁxed ﬁrst, and so in
reality the conﬁguration space of an abelian gauge the-
ory must be the space of holomorphic line bundles of a
given topological type, speciﬁed by the Chern number
d:

Picd(Σ)

The fact that d (and hence the topology) is not a
dynamical variable in gauge theory reﬂects the phys-
ical principle of conservation of magnetic charge.
Since this section concerns the possibility of magnetic
monopoles, d > 0.

Hence, having introduced holomorphic line bundles,
we are now ready to deﬁne what it means to take the
nth root of such a bundle:
Deﬁnition IV.1 Let L ∈ Picqd(Σ) be a holomorphic line
bundle. A holomorphic line bundle W is then a qth root
of L, provided that

⊗q := qW .

L = W

VI.

VARIATIONAL CALCULATION OF

TOPOLOGICAL DEGENERACY WITHOUT MONOPOLES,

IN n-DIMENSIONS

A.

Spin Structures from Cooper pairing

Here we give a brief review of Read and Green (2000)

to make the paper self-contained.

We will now assume that there is cooper-pairing,
and therefore q = 2. We also assume that there are no
magnetic monopoles. Later on, we will relax all of these
assumptions.

Our goal in this section is to show that, under these
limiting assumptions, the number of groundstates of
the Ginzburg-Landau model on a Riemann surface M is
the number of spin-structures on M, thus reproducing
the result of [1] without having to refer to the micro-
scopic theory at all.

The reason why superconductivity and spin struc-
tures have this peculiar relationship lies precisely with
the microscopic pairing mechanism that causes super-
conductivity. Recall that, for an ordinary quantum me-
chanical wave function of an electron, the energy den-
sity contains a term proportional to

|∇Aψ|2.

Note that here we are treating quantum mechanics as a
classical ﬁeld theory, which may easily be done by deﬁn-
ing the ﬁeld energy as E(ψ) = (cid:104)H(cid:105)
ψ. However, in the
Ginzburg Landau model, the free-energy density for the
cooper-pair condensate contains a term proportional to
(in units where the electron charge is one),

|∇2Aψ|2

As it turns out, our classical degeneracy factor will
reduce to the number of roots of a certain line bundle.
We tackle this problem with the full force of sheaf
cohomology in the Appendix.

reﬂecting the fact that a cooper pair, with two electrons,
reacts twice as strongly to ﬂuctuations in the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. So why does this explain the relation to
spin structures?

11

These conditions, which only make sense on a trivial
line bundle, imply that the value of the order parameter
at any given point is the parallel transport of its value
from anywhere else:

ψ(x) = Γ (∇)x

y

· ψ(y)

Since ψ is a global section, this implies that the holon-
omy of the cooper pair connection is always trivial in-
side the superconducting region. Since we have, for ev-
ery loop γ,

Γ (∇) = Γ (∇)· Γ (∇),

We have that the holonomy of the electron connection
squares to one, and therefore is ±1. We now can state
the following theorem:

Theorem VI.1 (Groundstate Subspace) The
ground-
states of a superconductor on M are in one-to-one
correspondence with the holonomy ±1-subspace of the
moduli space of ﬂat connections on M modulo gauge
transformations.

Proof. Every groundstate of the superconductor, by
the analysis above, corresponds to an equivalence class
[ψ,∇], where ∇ is a ﬂat connection with holonomy ±1,
and we have

[ψ,∇] ∼ [g2ψ, g∇]

Where g is a gauge-transformation. We are essentially
claiming that it suﬃces to represent each groundstate
by the gauge-equivalence class of ∇, and forget about
the order parameter.

This is because, to specify ψ, all we need is the value
ψ0 of the order parameter at a single point x in the
superconducting region; to obtain the value anywhere
else, we parallel transport via the associated cooper-pair
connection:

ψ(y) = Γ (∇)y

x · ψ0.

Therefore, by specifying a value ψ0 of the order param-
eter at a ﬁxed point x, we can recover the groundstate
which represents any given connection.

Once we choose such a value ψ0 along with represen-
tatives ∇i from each equivalence class of ﬂat connec-
tions, we ﬁnd that this deﬁnes a map of sets

∇ → (Γ (∇) gψ0, ∇)

(∇ = g∇i)
which factors onto a isomorphism, upon modding-out
by gauge transformations on both sides. (cid:3)

FIG. 1. The transformation properties of a cooper pair (top),
as contrasted with an electron (bottom).

Notice that ∇2A is not a connection on L; it is not
gauge covariant: if we apply a gauge transformation g
to our line bundle, we get

∇

−1dg+2A (gψ) = ∇2Aψ + A(gψ − ψ)

g

Therefore, if we treat d − 2A as a connection on L, then
the result of diﬀerentiation of the order-parameter is
not gauge-covariant.

The resolution (as covered in [4]) is to consider ψ as
a cross-section of a diﬀerent bundle, namely the tensor-
square L ⊗ L (see [4] for details). This is only natural,
since there are two electrons in a cooper pair. Then, a
gauge transformation g of L induces a gauge transfor-
mation g2 of L⊗ L:
∇

−1dg+2A (g2ψ) = ∇2Aψ

g

Therefore, by introducing the tensor-square of L as the
natural object to consider, we have made the derivative
gauge covariant. Therefore, ∇2A represents a connection
on L ⊗ L, and the order parameter is naturally a cross-
section

ψ : M → L⊗ L

of the tensor-square of L, where L is the original electron
bundle (see Figure 1). We will call this connection the
cooper-pair connection, and use the symbol ∇ to distin-
guish it from the electron connection ∇.
The Meissner eﬀect and London equations, which fol-
low from minimizing the zero-temperature Ginzburg-
Landau free energy, state that, for one, the electron
connection is ﬂat, and secondly, the covariant derivative
of the order parameter vanishes as well. The number of
solutions to these equations, at ﬁxed |ψ|, represent the
number of groundstates of our superconductor.

TABLE I. The groundstate degeneracy of a Ginzburg-Landau
superconductor on a manifold M exhibits a marked depen-
dence on the topology of M.

By our theorem, the groundstates of a superconduc-
tor are in one-to-one correspondence with the holon-
omy ±1-subspace of the moduli space of ﬂat connections
on M modulo gauge transformations. This is given by
H 1(M;Z2), and therefore we have an exact solution

#Groundstates = |H 1(M;Z2)|

(A.1)

(To see an explicit computation of this formula for a
number of physical examples, consult Table 1.) There-
fore, we have our main result; that the groundstate
subspace of a superconductor is a homotopy invariant
of M. This simple classical argument independently
reproduces the result in [3] that superconductors are
topologically ordered.

Now here is the relation to spin structures: for Σg a
Riemann surface of genus g, we can run a very similar
argument, replacing L⊗ L with a Spin(2)-bundle, and L
with the SO(2)-oriented frame bundle.

The reason why the mathematical argument will be
identical is because the structure groups and the rele-
vant covering maps ﬁt into a commutative square:

Spin(2)

(cid:107)

U(1)⊗ U(1)

z (cid:55)→ z2

−−−−−−−−−−−−→ SO(2)

(cid:107)
−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→ U(1)

z⊗ z (cid:55)→ z2

Therefore, it is not hard to see that, replacing the cooper-
pair connection with a spin connection, we have an anal-
ogous result

{spin structures on Σg} (cid:27) H 1(M;Z2).

Therefore, we have explained N. Read and Green’s
fascinating result in [1], namely, that a Riemann surface
has ground states exactly corresponding to the spin
structures on that surface, without referring to details
of the BCS Hamiltonian.

Cooper triplets, quadruplets, and beyond

electrons to group into bunches of q, for integer q. In

this case, the order parameter becomes a cross-section
of the q-fold tensor-bundle

⊗q = L⊗···⊗ L.

L

By a construction analogous to that of the cooper-pair
connection from the previous section, every electron
connection ∇ induces a canonical connection on L
⊗q,
which we denote by the symbol ∇.

We can thus repeat our argument in the previous
section, substituting in the variable q, easily getting the
next result:

Theorem VI.2 The groundstates of the charge-q Ginzburg-
Landau model on M are in one-to-one correspondence with
the holonomy Zq-subspace of the moduli space of ﬂat con-
nections on M modulo gauge transformations, where Zq ⊂
U(1) is the subgroup consisting of the qth-roots of unity.

The holonomy Zq-subspace of the moduli space of ﬂat
connections on M modulo gauge transformations comes
out to H 1(M;Zq), and therefore we again have an exact
solution

#Groundstates = |H 1(M;Zq)|

(A.2)

(To see an explicit application of this formula for a
number of physical examples with a variety of values of
q, consult Table 2.)

VII.

VARIATIONAL CALCULATION OF

TOPOLOGICAL DEGENERACY WITH MONOPOLES, IN 2

DIMENSIONS

So far, we have implicitly been assuming that the
electron bundle admits a ﬂat connection,
L is
trivial. If L is non-trivial, then it is impossible to satisfy
this ﬂatness condition, and the Meissner eﬀect will be
violated (see Figure 2).

i.e.

Here, we will consider superconductors on a Rie-
mann surface Σg. The case of higher dimensions is
quite exotic and and will be interesting to study from a

13

Where the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau model is
⊗q → L restricts to the canonical
deﬁned on L, and p : L
q-fold covering map on ﬁbres.

In Vortices in Ho|omorphic Line Bundles over Closed
Kahler Manifolds (1989), Steven Bradlow established a
bijection between eﬀective divisors and classes of mini-
mizers of the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional on a compact
Riemann surface. We present the result here:
Theorem VII.1 For each eﬀective divisor D ∈ Div(Σ)d
+,
there exists a unique minimizer of the Yang-Mills-Higgs
functional, modulo unitary gauge-transformation if and
only if

qd <

Vol(M)

4π

.

It seems that we have reached an impasse: according
to the analysis above, the Ginzburg-Landau model lacks
any interesting (i.e. topological) degeneracy.

However, from a physical perspective there is signif-
icant undercounting: to actually recover the physical
degeneracy of the Ginzburg-Landau model, we must
limit ourselves to gauge transformations of the original
electrons, i.e. L.

The following corollary shows that, upon passing to
these restricted gauge transformations, the number of
solutions multiplies by a topological factor, which is
precisely the same factor we have been encountering in
the previous sections:

Theorem VII.2 (Corollary) For each eﬀective divisor D ∈
+, there exist |H 1(Σg;Zq)| minimizers of the zero-
Div(Σ)d
temperature Ginzburg-Landau free-energy, modulo unitary
gauge-transformations, if and only

qd <

trivial line-bundle L, with geometry analogous to the twist in
mobius strip pictured above.

technological standpoint (i.e. dynamics of strings etc.) -
but we will have to leave that for another paper.

The case of two-dimensions is nice, because the Chern
number of L has a physical interpretation as the total
magnetic ﬂux:

(cid:90)

c(L) =

F

Σg

Since line bundles are characterized by their ﬁrst Chern
class, this means that, in our analysis, the magnetic ﬂux
will always be a non-zero integer.

To compute the degeneracy in the presence of these
topological obstructions will be rather diﬃcult, and
will require powerful tools from complex geometry,
such as sheaf cohomology. Therefore, we will start
by examining existing semi-classical results for gauge
theories.

Most of the results in the mathematical physics
literature are centered around a close-cousin of the
Ginzburg-Landau model: the Yang-Mills-Higgs model,
a quantum ﬁeld theory which serves as a toy model
for the famous Higgs mechanism. Before adding to
the scholarly discourse by extracting a new topological
degeneracy factor, in this section, we will review the
existing results.

The Yang-Mills-Higgs functional is deﬁned on L

⊗q,
and satisﬁes the following relation with the Ginzburg-
Landau free energy:

LY MH (ψ, p

∗∇) ≡ FGL(ψ,∇)

(a) The Yang-Mills-Higgs functional, which is essen-
tially a zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau free-
energy, as a function of the "cooper-pair connec-
tion":
SYMH(∇, ψ) ≡

(|∇ψ|2 +|F|2 +

(|ψ|2 − 1)2)

(cid:90)

(b) The zero-temperature Ginzburg-Landau free-
energy, which is a function of the "electron con-
nection":
FGL(∇, ψ) ≡

∗∇ψ|2 +|F|2 +

(|ψ|2 − 1)2).

Lemma IV.4: The free-energies (a) and (b) mentioned
above have the same minima, that is,
FGL(∇, ψ) = min
( ˜∇,ψ)

SYMH( ˜∇, ψ)

min
(∇,ψ)

Proof of Lemma. By Bradlow’s theorem, there exists some
minimizer ( ˜∇, ψ) of G. By our previous lemma, a cooper-
pair connection always has a qth root, and so we can
write

˜∇ = p

∗∇

for some electron connection ∇. Note that now, (∇q, ψ)
minimizes G. Also note that, by direct examination of
the relevant integrals,

FGL(∇, ψ) = SYMH(p

∗∇, ψ),

The lemma therefore follows easily from a standard
proof by contradiction. (cid:3).

Invoking Bradlow (1990), let [ ˜∇, ψ] be the unique gauge-
equivalence class of minimizers of G. To prove our the-
orem, it suﬃces to provide an isomorphism from the
space of groundstates to the space of qth roots of ˜∇. Con-
sider such a map deﬁned as follows:
[∇, φ] → [∇]

This is well-deﬁned, because, if [∇, φ] is a groundstate,
then

FGL(∇, φ) = min FGL = min SYMH,

and so, by Bradlow (1990), there exists some gauge-
transformation g that relates our groundstate to our
minimizer:

∗∇, φ) = (g ˜∇, gψ).

(p

In particular, this means that p
a map from groundstates to qth roots.

∗∇ ∈ [ ˜∇], and so we have

To see that this map is well-deﬁned modulo gauge

transformations, note that

[g∇, gqφ] (cid:55)→ [g∇] = [∇] (cid:88).

Finally, it suﬃces to show surjectivity and injectivity.
For surjectivity, suppose [∇] is a root. Then

∗∇ = g ˜∇.

p

∗∇, gψ) ∈ [ ˜∇, ψ], and so
∗∇, gψ) = min FGL = min SYMH. So we have a

in particular,

(p

Therefore,
SYMH(p
minimizer which is in the preimage:
[∇, gψ] (cid:55)→ [∇].

14

For injectivity, we note that

[∇, φ] (cid:55)→ [∇]
[∇, φ] (cid:55)→ [∇]

So two classes of groundstates get mapped to the
same root, if and only if the connections are gauge-
equivalent.(cid:3)

Therefore, we have proven that, on a non-trivial line-
bundle L, the groundstate degeneracy of the Ginzburg-
Landau model is still |H 1(M;Zq)|, provided that

dq <

Vol(M)

4π

.

Where the key ingredient was taking the existence
and uniqueness theorem of Bradlow, and showing that
the number of solutions multiplied by the topological
factor |H 1(M;Zq)|, upon passing to electron gauge-
transformations.

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: NEW

TECHNOLOGIES BASED OFF OF THE

SUPERCONDUCTING PLATFORM

In this paper, we reexamined the 60-year old
Ginzburg-Landau free-energy density in the modern
context of topological order. In doing so, we explained
the direct relationship between spin structures and
groundstates of a superconductor, without referring to
the microscopic theory.

Moreover, our argument was based oﬀ of the varia-
tional concept of minimizing the free-energy density,
and did not construct quantum operators on the
groundstate subspace, as is the standard method in the
literature.

That classical arguments reproduce quantum phe-
nomena such as groundstate degeneracy is a fascinating
peculiarity of the Ginzburg-Landau model, and merits
further investigation, perhaps building upon the in-
complete eﬀorts of Sections III and IV.

In dimension two, we saw how magnetic monopoles
led to additional degeneracy in superconductors, be-
yond the topology of the base manifold. This is the
fundamental principle behind our ability to engineer
topological quantum computers in two dimensions,
despite only having access to R2 in practice.

Another fascinating avenue of study along these lines
would be to investigate the technological implications
of superconducting physics in dimension three. In this
case, Bradlow’s theorems tell us that magnetic ﬂux will
be localized on complex codimension-one subvarieties,

which will manifest visually as strings. Such ﬂux strings
may form the foundation for fascinating new exotic ma-
terials.

The Ginzburg-Landau Densities

The Ginzburg-Landau free-energy density at tem-
perature T = 0, in units where the electron charge is
set to one, has three terms:

|∇qAψ|2 +

|B|2 +

(|ψ|2 − 1)2

We will denote the corresponding free energy by the
symbol FGL(ψ, A, T ). Here, the order parameter and
gauge ﬁeld are now deﬁned on a Riemannian manifold
M.

We now brieﬂy deﬁne the Ginzburg Landau eﬀective
ﬁeld theory, which we will take as our quantum model
of a superconductor.

The Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian density also has

four terms:

We will denote the corresponding eﬀective action by
the symbol SGL( ¯ψ, ¯A).

In the Ginzburg-Landau Lagrangian density,
the
order parameter and gauge ﬁeld are now deﬁned on the
spacetime M × R, and the line bundle here is simply the
L, where p : M × R → M forgets the
pullback bundle p

The Ginzburg-Landau eﬀective ﬁeld theory is then

tions on a given manifold M.

Theorem X.1 The space of holonomy-G ﬂat unitary con-
nections modulo unitary gauge transformations is the space
Hom(π1(M), G)/G, where G acts on Hom(π1(M), G) by
conjugation.

morphic line bundle is isomorphic to the Cech cohomology
group ˇH 1(M;Zq).
