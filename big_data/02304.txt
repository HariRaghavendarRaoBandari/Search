Fourier expansion of disk automorphisms via scattering in

layered media

Peter C. Gibson∗

March 7, 2016

Abstract

A family of orthogonal polynomials on the disk (which we call scattering polynomi-
als) serves to formulate a remarkable Fourier expansion of the composition of a sequence
of Poincar´e disk automorphisms. Scattering polynomials are tied to an exotic riemannian
structure on the disk that is hybrid between hyperbolic and euclidean geometries, and the
expansion therefore links this exotic structure to the usual hyperbolic one. The resulting
identity is intimately connected with the scattering of plane waves in piecewise constant
layered media. Indeed, a recently established combinatorial analysis of scattering sequences
provides a key ingredient of the proof. At the same time, the polynomial obtained by trunca-
tion of the Fourier expansion elegantly encodes the structure of the nonlinear measurement
operator associated with the ﬁnite time duration scattering experiment.

Introduction

Using recent results from scattering theory we derive the Fourier series expansion for an n-fold
composition of disk automorphisms, and show that the resulting identity connects diverse math-
ematical objects not previously known to be related. In particular, scattering polynomials (an
exotic family of orthogonal polynomials on the disk), a system of PDE with smooth coeﬃcients,
two diﬀerent riemannian structures on the disk, and the scattering of acoustic waves in layered
media are all shown to be connected through this identity.

The main result is stated below in §1.1. In §1.2 we brieﬂy outline scattering in layered media
and describe needed ingredients such as the reﬂection experiment Green’s function. We discuss
related literature and prior art in §1.3. The main result is proved in §2, some longer technical
arguments being relegated to the appendices. We explain in §3 how the principal identity
encodes the time limited scattering experiment and thereby provides fundamental insights into
its geometric and computational aspects. The paper concludes with a brief discussion in §4.

Let Z+ denote the nonnegative integers, including 0, let D ⊂ C denote the unit disk in the
complex plane, D its closure, and T its boundary, the unit circle. Given a pair of n-tuples

Our central object of interest is the value at 0 of an n-fold composition of the transformations

Ψ(w, z) = Ψw1

z1 ◦ · · · ◦ Ψwn

zn (0),

(1.3)

viewed as a function of the parameters (w, z). For each ﬁxed w, (1.3) is a function on the
n-torus z ∈ Tn and has a corresponding Fourier series with coeﬃcients depending on w.
It
turns out that these coeﬃcients have a beautiful structure, expressible very simply in terms of
a new family of orthogonal polynomials which we call scattering polynomials.

Deﬁnition 1.1 (scattering polynomials) For each (p, q) ∈ Z2 write ϕ(p,q) : C → C to de-
note the polynomial deﬁned as follows. If min{p, q} ≥ 1 set

ϕ(p,q)(ζ) = (−1)p

q(p+q−1)! (1 − ζ ¯ζ)

∂ p+q
∂ ¯ζ p∂ζ q (1 − ζ ¯ζ)p+q−1.

(1.4)

If min{p, q} < 0 or p = 0 < q set ϕ(p,q) = 0; and if p ≥ 0 set ϕ(p,0)(ζ) = ζ p.

That each ϕ(p,q) is actually a polynomial follows directly from (1.4), as does the fact that
pqϕ(p,q)(ζ) = 0 if ζ ∈ T (i.e. on T ϕ(p,q)(ζ) 6= 0 only if pq = 0). Less obvious is that the
scattering polynomials ϕ(p,q) comprise a complete set of eigenfunctions of the weighted laplacian

e∆ deﬁned as
the associated operator e∆ are detailed in §2.2.) Note that e∆ may be viewed as hybrid between

the euclidean laplacian ∆ and the hyperbolic laplacian (1 − x2 − y2)2∆/4, the Laplace-Beltrami
operator for the Poincar´e disk.

Deﬁnition 1.1 is all we need in order to describe the Fourier series for (1.3). With respect
to the various n-tuples that occur throughout the present paper, we adopt the convention that
indices beyond n should be interpreted as zero, so that for example, if k ∈ Zn, then kn+1 = 0.

Theorem 1 The Fourier series of the n-fold composition of disk automorphisms (1.3) is

Ψ(w, z) = Xk∈{1}×Z n

+(cid:18) nYj=1

ϕ(kj ,kj+1)(wj)(cid:19)zk.

(1.6)

(Note that invoking the notation (1.2), where ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈ Rn, recovers the conventional
form for Fourier characters eihξ,ki = zk.)

Although it comes from acoustic imaging, speciﬁcally the scattering of waves in layered
media, Theorem 1 is of interest in its own right. For instance, the right-hand side of (1.6) is

composed of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (i.e., e∆) for the riemannian metric

gij = 4δij /(1 − x2 − y2), while the left-hand side of (1.6) is comprised of automorphisms of the
hyperbolic metric gij = 4δij/(1 − x2 − y2)2. Thus the identity (1.6) has a surprising geometric
aspect—relating diﬀerent riemannian structures to one another.

The proof of Theorem 1 relies on three ingredients: a system of linear PDE with smooth
coeﬃcients that has a unique solution, and which the left-hand side of (1.6) can be shown to
satisfy; and two results from scattering in layered media—one of which is a classic backwards
recurrence formula, and the second of which is a combinatorial analysis of scattering sequences.
In the next section we describe more precisely the relevant layered media context. At this point
a word about notation is in order. In the context of layered media we will follow common usage
and use z to denote a real scalar—the depth coordinate—and write ζ for acoustic impedance,
which is a positive scalar-valued function of depth. This is not to be confused with the very
diﬀerent usage above.

1.2 Layered media

We consider layered media whose structure varies in the depth direction z only; coordinates are
oriented such that z increases downward into the medium from a reference plane at depth 0.
Given initial conditions that depend only on depth, the evolution of particle velocity u(z, t) in
a layered medium is governed by the one dimensional wave equation

where ζ(x) > 0 denotes acoustic impedance, and x is travel time depth

(ζux)x = 0

x(z) =Z z

(1.7)

(1.8)

Suppose further that ζ(x) = C0 is constant for x < 0, and that limx→∞ ζ(x) = 1. A basic
problem in acoustic imaging is to determine ζ(x) for x > 0 from scattering data. That is,
suppose a source waveform W ∈ C ∞
c (R) is supported on the negative half line, and initially
travels downward, corresponding to initial conditions

u(x, 0) = W (x) ut(x, 0) = −W ′(x).

(1.9)

The resulting echoes d(t) = u(0, t) recorded at x = 0 during a certain time interval 0 < t < T
comprise scattering data that carries information about ζ(x) for 0 < x < T
2 . The (forward)
scattering problem is to determine d given W and ζ; the inverse scattering problem is to
determine ζ given d, or given d and W .

We focus speciﬁcally on piecewise constant impedance of the form

ζ(x) = C0 +

nXj=1

CjH(x − xj).

(1.10)

Here H(x) denotes the Heaviside function, and jump points are indexed according to their
natural order

x0 = 0 < x1 < · · · < xn < xn+1 = ∞.

The number of layers n ≥ 2 is assumed to be ﬁxed; but the particular value of n can be
arbitrarily large.

Writing

one can easily reconstruct ζ in (1.10) from the pair (τ, r), giving a correspondence

(τ, r) =(cid:0)(τ1, . . . , τn), (r1, . . . , rn)(cid:1),

ζ ↔ (τ, r).

(1.13)

(1.14)

One may thus regard the reﬂectivity vector r and the travel time per layer vector τ as physical
parameters characterizing a given piecewise constant layered medium. It turns out that the
measured data d for the scattering problem can be expressed very simply in terms of (τ, r); for
convenience we therefore work with (τ, r) instead of ζ.

Standard analysis of reﬂection and transmission at layer interfaces shows that measured

scattering data has the general form

d = χ(0,T )W ∗ G(τ,r),

(1.15)

where G(τ,r) denotes the impulse response, or Green’s function, at the boundary. The latter is
a delta train, expressible in the form

G(τ,r)(t) =

∞Xi=1

aiδ(t − ti),

(1.16)

where, for each i, 0 < ti < ti+1 and ai 6= 0. We refer to the points ti as arrival times (always
indexed according to their natural order), and the corresponding ai as amplitudes.

For present purposes we need only consider the impulsive limit W → δ, in which the

measured data

d(t) = χ(0,T )G(τ,r)(t) =

imaxXi=1

aiδ(t − ti)

imax = max{i | 0 < ti < T }

(1.17)

is a time limited truncation of the Green’s function G(τ,r) itself.

The objective of acoustic imaging is to solve the inverse problem, that is, to infer the phys-
ical parameters (τ, r) given the data d in (1.17). This requires knowing how the amplitudes
and arrival times depend on the physical parameters. While the structure of the arrival times
is reasonably straightforward (each ti has the form hτ, ki for some k ∈ Zn
+), the amplitudes
depend on the cumulative weight of successive reﬂections and transmissions from all simul-
taneously arriving scattering sequences. The associated combinatorial problem was solved in
[4], relatively recently considering the history of the subject. (See [4] for further details on
scattering sequences.) The resulting formulas for the ai serve as a ﬁrst step toward proving
Theorem 1.

1.3 Connections to existing literature

Scattering polynomials ϕ(p,q) for which min{p, q} ≥ 1 are orthogonal with respect to the area
measure dµ = 4 dxdy/(1 − x2 − y2) on the disk, but they do not belong to any of the classical
families of orthogonal polynomials. This is because monomials xmyn are not in general inte-
grable with respect to dµ (even 1 is not integrable!), and so scattering polynomials cannot be
generated according to the classical prescription of applying Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization

to monomials. Nevertheless, recent developments in approximation theory (independent from
the work leading to the present paper) have produced general classes of orthogonal polyno-
mials of which scattering polynomials can be see to be a special case; see [7, Proposition 2.1
and Lemma 3.2] and [2, §3]. The latter work does not contain the Rodrigues-type formula in

Deﬁnition 1.1 or the weighted laplacian e∆, nor does it mention the corresponding riemannian

structure—so there is limited overlap. The connection of scattering polynomials to scattering
theory and to disk automorphisms presented here is completely new.

There is an extensive literature on the one dimensional scattering problem associated with
layered media; see [1] for numerous early references. There are two main classes of media that
have been considered, depending on the structure of the impedance function ζ occurring in (1.7).
The ﬁrst class corresponds to square integrable ζ ′/ζ ∈ L2(R). This case is well understood,
as exempliﬁed by the paper [8]. Another class of media disjoint from the ﬁrst corresponds to
piecewise constant ζ—the class we consider here. Superﬁcially, piecewise constant ζ seems like a
much simpler structure than arbitrary ζ ′/ζ ∈ L2(R), but in fact from the deterministic point of
view piecewise constant media are less well understood. Discontinuous coeﬃcients in (1.7) have
proven to be a formidable technical diﬃculty. The main approach to piecewise constant media
has been probabilistic, under the rubric of random media. This has a large literature of its own,
much of which is synthesized in the treatise [3]. The most recent development in deterministic
analysis of piecewise constant layered media is [4], which serves as a direct antecedent to the
present paper.

2 Proof of Theorem 1

The proof of Theorem 1 is organized as follows. We link together two known results from the
theory of scattering in layered media to obtain a special case of the theorem. This is carried out
in §2.1, Theorem 4 being a version of the main result valid only for real parameters w ∈ [−1, 1]n.
n
The central technical diﬃculty is the extension of Theorem 4 to complex w ∈ D

.

Next in §2.2 we establish several facts about the scattering polynomials, connecting them

to both their real counterparts and to the modiﬁed laplacian e∆.

In §2.3 we introduce the technical key, which is a system of PDE with smooth coeﬃcients,
and we complete the proof. We show that Ψ(w, z) satisﬁes the PDE (Lemma 2.2) and that the
PDE has a unique solution in the form of the required Fourier expansion, up to a sequence of
undetermined scalars (Lemma 2.3). Theorem 1 follows once the scalars are determined, which
is accomplished using Theorem 4. The proofs of the two main lemmas are deferred to the
appendices.

2.1 Preliminaries

The purpose of this section is two recall two known results which combine to yield a special
case of Theorem 1.

Here we use the (physicists’) version of the Fourier transform consistent with the formula

ˆf (σ) =ZR

f (t)eiσt dt.

(2.1)

The following well-know result is sometimes referred to as a backward recurrence formula.

Theorem 2 (See [3, §3.5.2]) The Fourier transform with respect to time of the Green’s func-
tion (1.16) is

G(τ,r)(σ) = Ψr1

eiτ2σ ◦ · · · ◦ Ψrn

eiτnσ (0).

The next result provides a key step leading to Theorem 1; it involves a family of polynomials
of a real variable which were determined by combinatorial analysis and which led to the discovery
of scattering polynomials. Given (p, q) ∈ Z2, set m = |p − q| and ν = min{p, q} − 1.

There are considerable technical diﬃculties involved in progressing beyond Theorem 4 to

Theorem 1. The ﬁrst step is to recognize the correct complexiﬁcation.

2.2 Complexiﬁcation

If we complexify the left-hand side of Theorem 4 by extending the real parameters rj ∈ [−1, 1]
to complex parameters wj ∈ D, then what is the corresponding modiﬁcation of the right-hand
side? It clearly doesn’t work to replace each f (kj,kj+1)(rj) with f (kj,kj+1)(wj), since the latter
are holomorphic in wj whereas the disk automorphisms Ψwj

zj depend on both wj and wj.

Something more subtle is required. What works is to replace each polynomial f (kj,kj+1)(rj)
with ei(kj −kj+1)θj f (kj,kj+1)(rj), which amounts to replacing each f (kj,kj+1)(rj) with the scattering
polynomial ϕ(kj ,kj+1)(wj), as we shall now show. This is also a convenient juncture at which to

verify the earlier claim that scattering polynomials are eigenvalues of the operator e∆ deﬁned

by the formulas (1.5).

Much more is true. The unit disk endowed with the riemannian metric gij = 4δij/(1 − x2 −

positive integers. For each positive integer λ,

ker(e∆ + λ) = span(cid:8)ϕ(p,q) | pq = λ and p, q ∈ Z+(cid:9).
In particular, the dimension of ker(e∆ + λ) is the number of divisors of λ.

Lemma 2.2 The n-fold composition of disk automorphisms Ψ(w, z) satisﬁes (2.10).

Veriﬁcation of Lemma 2.2 is somewhat technical and so is consigned to appendix A.2. The
next result is that the system (2.10) has a unique solution that can be computed in series form
directly by separation of variables. This is possible precisely because the equations (2.10) have
real analytic coeﬃcients—in marked contrast to the discontinuous coeﬃcient that appears in
the wave equation (1.7). Separation of variables leads to an expansion of the solution to (2.10)

in terms of eigenfunctions of the operators e∆j, that is, in terms of scattering polynomials up to a

sequence of scalars. The scalars can then be determined using the embryonic form, Theorem 4,
of the main result.

where each βk is a scalar.

(2.13)

Since for each k ∈ Zn, Φ(r, k) 6≡ 0 if Φ(w, k) 6≡ 0, equation (2.13) implies by uniqueness of
Fourier coeﬃcients that βk = 1 for each k such that Φ(w, k) 6≡ 0, thereby reducing (2.12) to
Theorem 1.

3 Structure of the scattering data

In the present section we return to scattering in layered media and discuss the connection of
the time-limited truncation of the Green’s function, χ(0,T )G(τ,r), to the Fourier expansion of
Ψ(w, z) given in Theorem 1. The emphasis is primarily on qualitative insights.

To begin, we compare previously known results, in the guise of Theorem 2, to Theorem 1
and its precursor Theorem 4. Translating Theorem 2 into the current the current notation (2.9)
yields the formula

\
G(τ,r)(σ) = Ψ(r, z(σ)) where

(3.1)

z(σ) =(cid:0)eiτ1σ, . . . , eiτnσ(cid:1).

In order to use this formula to compute the Fourier transform of data measured over a ﬁnite
time interval 0 < t < T one has to contend with the convolution of the backward recurrence
formula with a modulated sinc function,

\

χ(0,T )G(τ,r)(σ) =

T

2πZ ∞

−∞

Ψ(r, z(s))ei(σ−s)T /2 sinc((σ − s)T /2) ds.

(3.2)

Evaluation of this integral for a single σ involves the values of Ψ(r, z(s)) for all −∞ < s < ∞,
which hugely inﬂates the computational expense.

By contrast, Theorem 3 in conjunction with Lemma 2.1 and the notation (2.9) implies that

time limited data may be expressed as

χ(0,T )G(τ,r)(t) = Xk∈{1}×Z

n−1
+
hτ,ki<T

Φ(r, k)δ(t − hτ, ki),

(3.3)

whose Fourier transform is

\

χ(0,T )G(τ,r)(σ) = Xk∈{1}×Z

n−1
+
hτ,ki<T

Φ(r, k)z(σ)k.

(3.4)

There is a ﬁnite set of lattice points k ∈ Zn
+ that meet the constraint hτ, ki < T , so the
right-hand side of (3.4) is a polynomial. This shows that (3.2) may be computed exactly by
polynomial evaluation, avoiding altogether the necessity for approximation imposed by the
convolution (3.2). (In addition to being exact, polynomial evaluation is inherently fast for low
dimension n and suﬃciently short times T .)

Equation (3.4) shows how Theorem 1 encodes the time limited scattering experiment: trun-
cation of the Fourier series for Ψ(w, z), evaluated at (r, z(σ)), is the Fourier transform of the
time limited scattering data. Indeed this encoding illuminates the previously hidden geometric
nature of the scattering process, as follows. Note that the function

z(σ) =(cid:0)eiτ1σ, . . . , eiτnσ(cid:1)

− ∞ < σ < ∞

(3.5)

is a line on the torus with direction vector τ . Generically, in particular if τ1, . . . , τn are linearly
independent over Z, the line (3.5) is a leaf of the n-dimensional analogue of a Kronecker foliation,
and therefore everywhere dense on Tn. The scattering data samples the polynomial

PT (r, z) = Xk∈{1}×Z

on the leaf z(σ), which winds around the torus haphazardly, according to the ergodic nature
of the generalized Kronecker foliation, eventually sampling PT (r, z) near every z ∈ Tn. (See [6,
§1.5 and §4.2].) This remarkable structure is completely hidden in the scattering data in its
raw form as described by equation (1.17), which just looks like noise.

The scattering data fails to sample PT (r, z) densely on the torus in the non-generic case
where the entries of τ are all integer multiples of a ﬁxed quantity. From the point of view of
trying to recover r from the scattering data this is the worst possible scenario—yet it corresponds
to Gaupillaud media, perhaps the most extensively studied model for piecewise constant layered
media (see [3, §3.5.4] and [1]). Gaupillaud media have layers of equal thickness. This seems like
a natural simpliﬁcation from the point of view of ultimate discretization (the rationale in [1])
but the geometric discussion above shows that this simpliﬁcation misses the generic behaviour
of the underlying model.

In summary, Theorem 1 encodes the scattering of waves in layered media in a way that
gives substantial insight into the ﬁnite time duration scattering experiment both from a com-
putational and geometric perspective—and exposes a drawback of the common assumption of
constant layer depth.

4 Conclusion

In the present section we discuss very brieﬂy the contributions of the paper and suggest some
directions for further investigation.

A principal contribution of the present paper, beyond Theorem 1 itself, is to show that the
system of PDE (2.10) has a direct bearing on the propagation of waves in layered media. The

In fact, as discussed in §1.3, scattering
were not previously known to have any such role.
polynomials themselves are new, having only recently appeared in the approximation theory
literature in the context of general families of orthogonal polynomials. And the riemannian

weighted laplacian e∆ occurring in (2.10) and its eigenfunctions, the scattering polynomials,
structure on the disk gij = 4δij/(1 − x2 − y2), of which e∆ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator,

seems to be entirely unknown.

From the perspective of PDE generally, there is relatively little machinery available for
handling discontinuous coeﬃcients. We have demonstrated that the discontinuous coeﬃcient in
(1.7) can be handled by means of the smooth higher dimensional system (2.10), in which there
is one dimension for each discontinuity in the original coeﬃcient. This is highly suggestive:
can the idea of trading a PDE with discontinuous coeﬃcients for a smooth higher dimensional
system be implemented in other contexts?

Theorem 1 is also interesting quite apart from its relation to layered media. From the
geometric point of view, it is surprising that automorphisms of the Poincar´e disk should have
such a seemingly natural connection to orthogonal functions on the disk with metric tensor
gij = 4δij/(1 − x2 − y2)—in other words, scattering polynomials. It would be interesting to
know whether this is a special case of a more general phenomenon.

A Some technical proofs

A.1 Proof of Theorem 5

Note that the angular part of ϕ(p,q)(ρeiσ), namely ei(p−q)σ, is a pure frequency. Therefore if

p − q 6= p′ − q′, then ϕ(p,q) and ϕ(p′,q′) are orthogonal, both in L2(cid:0)D, 4dxdy/(1 − x2 − y2)(cid:1)
and L2(cid:0)D, dxdy(cid:1).

In particular, if pq = p′q′ and (p, q) 6= (p′, q′), then ϕ(p,q) and ϕ(p′,q′) are
orthogonal, so the set of scattering polynomials corresponding to any ﬁxed eigenvalue is linearly
independent.

In order to complete the proof of Theorem 5, it remains to show that: (1) only non-negative

and λ ≥ 1 there is at most one radial function f (ρ) (up to scalar multiplication) such that

integers are eigenvalues of −e∆ with zero boundary values; and (2) for any two integers n 6= 0
f (ρ)einσ is an eigenfunction of −e∆ with eigenvalue λ. Both (1) and (2) will be seen to follow
from separation of variables applied to the eigenvalue equation for −e∆, as follows.
Since it is elliptic and has analytic coeﬃcients, the operator e∆ + λ is analytic hypoelliptic
for any constant λ. Therefore any distributional eigenfunction ϕ of −e∆ is necessarily a real

analytic function [5, Thm. 10]. Such a function is the uniform limit of its radial Fourier series

ϕ(ρeiσ) =Xn∈Z

an(ρ)einσ,

In other words, real analytic tensor products of the form f (ρ)einσ, where n ∈ Z, span the

on which the operator −e∆ may be evaluated term by term. The image of any particular
term an(ρ)einσ by −e∆ is a function An(ρ)einσ having the same angular part. Hence if ϕ is
an eigenfunction of −e∆ with eigenvalue λ, the same is true of each nonzero term an(ρ)einσ.
eigenspaces of −e∆, and separation of variables is guaranteed not to miss any solutions to the
Suppose therefore that, for some n ∈ Z, f (ρ)einσ is a real analytic eigenfunction of −e∆

corresponding to non-zero eigenvalue λ such that f (1) = 0. We shall verify that the eigenvalue
equation determines f up to a scalar multiple, and that λ is necessarily a positive integer, as
follows. Expressing the hybrid laplacian in polar coordinates yields

eigenvalue problem.

ρ2(1 − ρ2)f ′′ + r(1 − ρ2)f ′ +(cid:0)4λρ2 − n2(1 − ρ2)(cid:1)f = 0.

By real analyticity f has a convergent Taylor expansion,

Assuming f is not identically zero, one deduces directly from (A.3),(A.4),(A.5) that the least
index m for which bm 6= 0 is m = |n|, with the particular choice of b|n| determining f itself by
recurrence. This proves that there is at most one radial function f (ρ) (up to choice of b|n|) such

that f (ρ)einσ is an eigenfunction of −e∆ corresponding to a given non-zero eigenvalue λ.

Write m = |n|. Solving the recurrence yields bm+2j+1 = 0 (j ≥ 0),

bm+2 =

and

bm+2j =

The boundary value f (1) = 0 determines possible values of λ. By (A.6), f (1) = bmξ(λ), where

(A.7)

Convergence of the seriesP 1/(ν(m + ν)) for all ν ≥ 1 ensures that f (1) = bmξ(λ) = 0 if and

only if λ = ν(m + ν) for some ν ≥ 1. This proves that λ is a positive integer, completing the
proof of Theorem 5.

Slightly more work produces the scattering polynomials themselves, up to a scalar multiple.

It follows from (A.6) that

bm+2j = 0 if j > ν

and

bm+2j 6= 0 if 0 ≤ j ≤ ν.

Thus f (ρ) is a polynomial of precise degree m + 2ν that has a zero of order m at ρ = 0, and
such a solution exists for every pair of integers m ≥ 0 and ν ≥ 1. Set

β0 = 1,

βj = 1 −

ν(m + ν)
j(m + j)

(1 ≤ j ≤ ν).

(A.8)

Note in particular that βν = 0. Combining the formula (A.6) with the expansion (A.2) shows
that

βs(cid:17)ρ2j,

which has two associated eigenvalues ϕ(ρe±imσ) = f (ρ)e±imσ if m ≥ 1, and just one if m = 0.
With m = |n| = |p − q| and ν = min{p, q}, the formula (A.9) is proportional to f (p,q)(ρ) and
f (q,p)(ρ) as deﬁned in (2.2). Thus separation of variables yields the scattering polynomials (up

to a scalar multiple) directly from the eigenvalue equation for −e∆.

To begin we introduce a nonlinear ﬁrst-order operator that will play an important auxiliary
role in our analysis. For each 1 ≤ j ≤ n, let ∇j denote the gradient operator with respect to

(This is essentially the quadratic form associated with Lj, in the sense that hLjv, vi =R Ejv.)

Proposition A.1 EjΨ(w, z) = 0 for every 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Proof. We argue by induction on the sequence of functions

v = Ψwj

as j decreases from n to 1. The base case v = Ψwn
j < n. Since

∂v

Proposition A.2 LjΨ(w, z) = 0 for every 1 ≤ j ≤ n.

Proof. This is proved along the same lines as Prop A.1, by an induction on the sequence of

−e∆j = 0,

Lastly, Ψ(w, z) satisﬁes the partial boundary condition (2.10c) automatically and hence, by

Propositions A.2 and A.3, the full system (2.10).

A.3 Proof of Lemma 2.3

The pairing of a distribution with a test function will be denoted by square brackets, whatever
the domain; we take distributions to be continuous linear functionals (as opposed to conjugate

linear). Let u ∈ D′(D

where µk(z) = zk/(2π)n = e−ihk,ξi/(2π)n. In order that u be considered as a candidate solution
to the system (2.10) it has to be possible to interpret the partial boundary condition (2.10c).

This requires in particular that u be trace class in the sense that the series Pk∈Z n ck should

converge weakly to a bona ﬁde distribution in D′(D
). In fact for any distributional solution
u to (2.10) the Fourier coeﬃcients ck must be smooth functions, as follows. (In reference to
lattice points k ∈ Zn we use the convention established earlier whereby kn+1 = 0.)

Proposition A.4 Any distributional solution u to the equations (2.10a) has real analytic
Fourier coeﬃcients ck (k ∈ Zn). Each such coeﬃcient is a tensor product univariate func-

Since the operator −e∆j − kjkj+1 is elliptic with real analytic coeﬃcients it follows by analytic

hypoellipticity [5, Theorem 10] that each ck is real analytic. Thus the boundary condition
(2.10c) may be interpreted in the sense of ordinary functions, where

u(w, 1) = Xk∈Z n

ck(w).

functions of the hybrid laplacian,

The coeﬃcient dk,l is deﬁned in terms of u by the formula

[dk,l, ρ] =(cid:2)ck, (ρ ⊗ µl) ◦ P(cid:3) =(cid:2)u, ((ρ ⊗ µl) ◦ P ) ⊗ µk(cid:3)

for test functions ρ ∈ C ∞([0, 1]n). If u satisﬁes the equation (2.10b) it follows that

(A.13)

0 = [Cju, ((ρ ⊗ µl) ◦ P ) ⊗ µk]

= [u, −Cj((ρ ⊗ µl) ◦ P ) ⊗ µk]
= [u, −(lj − kj + kj+1)((ρ ⊗ µl) ◦ P ) ⊗ µk]

where

Cj =

Therefore −(lj − kj + kj+1)dk,l = 0 for 1 ≤ j ≤ n, so that dk,l = 0 unless l = k − ˜k, as claimed.

Relabeling appropriately, we may thus express the functions ck in the form

ck(w) = dk(r)eihk−˜k,θi =

(A.15)

(A.16)

In conjunction with Lemma 2.1, equation (A.14) shows that if kjkj+1 ≥ 1, then φj has angular
part ei(kj −kj+1)θj and is hence proportional to ϕ(kj ,kj+1). Also, if kj > 0 and kj+1 = 0, then
φj is proportional to ϕ(kj ,0), since, up to a scalar multiple, the latter is the unique harmonic
function with angular part eikjθj . Lastly, if kjkj+1 < 0 for any 1 ≤ j ≤ n, then φj = 0 and
ck = 0. Thus ck 6= 0 only for lattice points k for which kjkj+1 has constant sign.

The structure of the function Ψ(w, 1) further restricts the set of lattice points k at which

ck 6= 0 through condition (A.16).

Since Ψwn

1 (0) = wn, the function Ψ(w, 1) is holomorphic in the variable wn, and Ψ(w, 1) is

therefore determined by its restriction to the set

{w ∈ D

| |wn| = 1}.

follows by the above formula that they are again satisﬁed for (lj, . . . , ln). For example, the total
