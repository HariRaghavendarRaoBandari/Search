MULTIPLE RADIAL POSITIVE SOLUTIONS OF SEMILINEAR ELLIPTIC

PROBLEMS WITH NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

DENIS BONHEURE, CHRISTOPHER GRUMIAU, AND CHRISTOPHE TROESTLER

ABSTRACT. Assuming BR is a ball in RN, we analyze the positive solutions of the problem

(cid:40)−∆u + u = |u|p−2u,

∂ν u = 0,

in BR,
on ∂ BR,

that branch out from the constant solution u = 1 as p grows from 2 to +∞. The non-zero
constant positive solution is the unique positive solution for p close to 2. We show that
there exist arbitrarily many positive solutions as p → ∞ (in particular, for supercritical
exponents) or as R → ∞ for any ﬁxed value of p > 2, answering partially a conjecture
in [12]. We give the explicit lower bounds for p and R so that a given number of solutions
exist. The geometrical properties of those solutions are studied and illustrated numerically.
Our simulations motivate additional conjectures. The structure of the least energy solutions
(among all or only among radial solutions) and other related problems are also discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION

In this paper, we consider the semilinear elliptic problem
in Ω,
in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

−∆u + λ u = |u|p−2u,

u > 0,
∂νu = 0,



where Ω is a smooth bounded domain in RN, N (cid:62) 3, λ > 0, p > 2 and ∂ν denotes the out-
ward normal derivative. This problem, sometimes referred to as the Lane-Emden equation
with Neumann boundary conditions, arises for instance in mathematical models which aim
to study pattern formation, and more speciﬁcally in those governed by diffusion and cross-
diffusion systems [50]. The problem is also related to the stationary Keller-Segel system
in chemotaxis [30, 34, 35, 39].

As (Pλ ,p) admits a constant solution, the solvability of (Pλ ,p) differs from the case of

positive solutions of the Lane-Emden equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions

(Pλ ,p)

−∆u = |u|p−2u,

as a consequence of Pohozaev’s identity (see [56]).

In the sequel of the paper we set

(1.2)

The subcriticality assumption (1.2) allows to tackle the problem (Pλ ,p) with variational
methods, i.e., the equation arises as the Euler-Lagrange equation of the energy functional

Eλ ,p : H1(Ω) → R : u (cid:55)→

1

2(cid:90)Ω|∇u|2 + λ u2 −

1

p(cid:90)Ω|u|p.

Moreover, due to the compact embedding H1(Ω) (cid:44)→ Lp(Ω), the existence of a solution
to (Pλ ,p) follows by standard arguments. Indeed, it is enough to minimize Eλ ,p on the
Nehari manifold

Nλ ,p :=(cid:8)u ∈ H1 \{0} : E (cid:48)λ ,p(u)[u] = 0(cid:9)

and to observe that the minimizer is nonnegative whereas the strong maximum principle
implies its positivity. The minimizers are called least energy or ground state solutions.
Looking at the quadratic form E (cid:48)(cid:48)λ ,p(u0)[u,u], it is easily seen that any minimizer u0 is non
constant if1 λ (p− 2) > λ2(Ω). On the other hand, if λ is small, the only minimizer is the
constant solution as Lin, Ni and Takagi [39] proved that uniqueness holds for (Pλ ,p) for
λ small.

In contrast with the nonexistence result for (1.1), the energy functional for the critical
exponent, Eλ ,2∗, achieves its minimum on Nλ ,2∗. Moreover, Wang [65] proved that when
λ is sufﬁciently large, the constant solution cannot be a minimizer.

For λ small and p = 2∗, Lin and Ni [38] conjectured that the constant solution must be
the unique solution. The conjecture was studied by Adimurthi and Yadava [2,3] and Budd,
Knapp and Peletier [17] in the case of radial solutions when Ω is a ball. It happens that in
this case, the conjecture is true in dimension N = 3 or N (cid:62) 7, while it is false in dimension
N = 4,5,6. The conjecture was further extended to convex domains in dimension N =
3 and has lead to many developments in the recent years. We refer to [64] and to the
references therein for further details.

In the supercritical range, namely when p > 2∗, most of the previous works on the
existence of solutions of (Pλ ,p) are devoted to perturbative cases where either λ → +∞
or a slightly supercritical exponent 2∗ + ε is considered, see e.g. [25, 60, 61]. By scaling,
it is easily seen that the case λ → +∞ amounts to consider a small diffusion coefﬁcient ε
(in front of −∆), see below. In this setting, it is physically relevant to study the existence
of solutions which concentrates around a single or multiple points or even around some
curve or a higher dimensional manifold as ε → 0, see for example [1, Chapter 9 and 10],
[5, 24, 42–45, 53, 54] and the references therein.
In this paper, we deal with (Pλ ,p) in a “non-perturbative way” and therefore our con-
tribution is more closely related to the recent works [8, 12, 13, 31, 62]. It was observed
in [62] that when Ω = BR is a ball of radius R > 0, compactness can be recovered in the
supercritical case by considering the subspace of radially increasing functions of H1
rad(BR),
where H1
rad(BR) is the space of functions of H1(BR) invariant under the action of the group
O(N). This fact was used in [12] to prove the existence of a non-constant radially increas-
ing solution of (Pλ ,p) in the supercritical regime, i.e., without assuming (1.2), under the
assumption that2

In the critical case, the existence of such a radially increasing solution has been proved
using a shooting argument and the Emden-Fowler transformation in [2] under the same
assumption

λ (p− 2) > λ rad

2 (BR).

λ (2∗ − 2) > λ rad

2 (BR).

This condition is satisﬁed if R is large enough.

In our study of (Pλ ,p), one of our main motivation is to understand to what extent the
precise value of p plays a role in the existence and qualitative properties of solutions. Our
main results are multiplicity of solutions with respect to the value of the power p, without
assuming subcriticality. It has been shown in [12, 31, 62] that for the Neumann problem
(Pλ ,p) in a ball, no growth restriction is needed to prove the existence of at least one non
constant solution. Since we deal with a simpler model than in the quoted references, we
are able to perform here a reﬁned analysis. Namely, we obtain non trivial solutions that
branch out from the constant solution, see Section 3. Combined with a priori estimates,
this leads to the following multiplicity result.

n+1(BR), then Problem (Pλ ,p) has at least n distinct non constant

Theorem 1.1. Assume Ω = BR , N (cid:62) 2, n ∈ N0, p ∈ ]2, +∞[ and λ > 0.

(ii) If λ (p− 2) > λ rad
(iii) If λ (2∗ − 2) > λ rad

n+1(BR) and p < 2∗, then (Pλ ,p) possesses at least 2n distinct non
n+1(BR) and N (cid:62) 3, there exists εn,R > 0 such that if

constant radial solutions.

n+1(BR)− εn,R < λ (p− 2) < λ rad
λ rad

n+1(BR),

then (Pλ ,p) has at least 2n distinct non constant radial solutions.

This theorem implies the existence of arbitrarily many solutions for either large p or
large R. We anticipate that the n solutions ui are distinguished by the number of nodal
regions of ui−1 (and also by the number of critical points). Indeed, the bifurcation analysis
shows that, given a positive integer n, (Pλ ,p) has at least one radial solution u such that
u− 1 has n nodal regions provided p > 2 + λ rad
n+1(BR)/λ (see Section 3 for more details).
We also anticipate that the validity of (iii) relies on a key estimate of Bessel’s function (see
Lemma 3.2). Numerical evidence shows it to be valid in dimension N = 2 but this is not
formally proved.

Theorem 1.1 contrasts with the classical uniqueness result [28] of either radial or non
radial solutions of (1.1) in a ball. Even in the case of an annulus where uniqueness may fail
— coexistence of radial and non radial solutions was ﬁrst observed in [14] — uniqueness
in the class of radial solutions was proved in [51]. Multiplicity for (Pλ ,p) was observed
in [13] where the existence of at least three non constant solutions is proved but the results
therein are perturbative, assuming p → ∞, and only concern the case of an annulus.
Theorem 1.1 is consistent with the analysis of [65] in the critical case p = 2∗. One of
the added value of our result is that it holds for any p > 2 and gives further and precise
informations on the multiplicity of solutions and not solely on the existence.

The structure of the bifurcations (see Fig. 1) also allows to identify degenerate radial
solutions along some of the branches (see Theorem 3.12). This leads to another striking
difference between the problems (Pλ ,p) and (1.1) as it is known that the positive solution
to (1.1) is non-degenerate when Ω is a ball [21, 36, 59] or a “large” annulus [7].

The bifurcation analysis can also be performed without assuming radial symmetry of
the domain Ω, see also [52]. However, in this case, it seems necessary to restrict ourselves
to a nonlinearity with subcritical growth. Also we do not have such a precise picture of
the bifurcations since non simple eigenvalues may arise and the study of the behavior of
solutions along a branch is much more delicate. In particular, we cannot expect any a priori
bounds in the supercritical regime and we expect bifurcations from inﬁnity.

Even in the case of a radially symmetric domain, non-radial bifurcations appear, for
instance at the ﬁrst bifurcation point. Indeed, this ﬁrst bifurcation occurs at a non-radial
eigenvalue of the elliptic operator (see Section 3). Nevertheless, the corresponding eigen-
functions are axially symmetric. As we can perform our bifurcation analysis in the space
of axially symmetric functions and since it provides axially symmetric functions along the
branches, it is natural to conjecture that the ﬁrst bifurcation is responsible of the symmetry
breaking of the least energy solution when 2 + λ2(BR)/λ < 2∗ (as it is also expected that
u = λ 1/(p−2) is the unique positive least energy solution for p (cid:54) 2 +λ2(BR)/λ ). Moreover,
we conjecture that this ﬁrst bifurcation is unbounded in p leading to the existence of a
non-radial solution for large p on large balls or for large λ (see Section 6.1).
Conjecture 1.2. Let N (cid:62) 3, λ > 0, Ω = BR and 2 + λ2(BR)/λ < 2∗. For every p ∈
]2 + λ2(BR)/λ , +∞[, there exists a positive non radial solution of (Pλ ,p) which is axi-
ally symmetric.

Concerning the qualitative properties of the least energy solutions to Problem (Pλ ,p),
Lopes showed that such a solution is even with respect to a family of hyperplanes, see [40],
and in fact it is furthermore cap symmetric, see [66]. Moreover, Lopes showed that either
the least energy solution is constant or it is non-radially symmetric. We provide in Section 5
an alternative and shorter proof of this fact. This in turn provides the upper bound 2 +
λ2(BR)/λ on the exponent p at which the radial symmetry of least energy solutions is lost.
For p close to 2, as a consequence of [11], any least energy solution of (Pλ ,p) is invariant
under the action of the symmetry group of the domain Ω. For instance, in radial domains,

u(0)1p=2∗p2+λrad2/λ2+λrad3/λSEMILINEAR ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS WITH NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

these are radial functions. According to the previous discussion, this suggests, at least for
the ball, that for p close to 2, any least energy solution is in fact constant. This is actually
true for every domain, see Theorem 2.3. Numerical experiments, based on the mountain
pass algorithm, suggest that 2 + λ2(BR)/λ is the exact threshold for the existence of non
constant least energy solutions, see Section 6.
Conjecture 1.3. Let N (cid:62) 2, λ > 0, p ∈ ]2,2∗[ and Ω = BR. The positive constant solution
is the least energy solution to (Pλ ,p) if and only if p < 2 + λ2(BR)/λ and there is no
other positive solution in this range of the parameters. For p > 2 + λ2(BR)/λ , the least
energy solutions are not radially symmetric and belong to the branch bifurcating from

Our numerical simulations also complements the papers [53, 54] where it was shown

(p,u) =(cid:0)2 + λ2(BR)/λ ,λ 1/(p−2)(cid:1).

that, on a smooth domain Ω, the least energy solutions uε of

∂νu = 0,

with f (u) = |u|p−2u with 2 < p < 2∗ concentrate, as ε → 0, around a single point of the
boundary ∂Ω. If Ω = BR, this obviously means that when R is large, the radial symmetry
of least energy solutions breaks down at any ﬁxed subcritical exponent. Our analytical
results and the numerical simulations indicate that “large” likely means 1 + λ2(BR) < 2∗.
In Section 4, we apply our radial bifurcation analysis on the problem (Pε). The param-
eter ε > 0 aims here to model a small diffusion. By a simple scaling argument, it is easily
seen that Problem (Pε) with f (u) = |u|p−2u is equivalent to (Pλ ,p) with λ = 1 in the ball
BR/√ε. We require few assumptions on f . Namely, f is of class C 1 and satisﬁes, for some
u0 > 0,

third assumption provides a priori bounds for a large family of solutions which bifurcate
from the constant solution u0.
Theorem 1.4. Assume f ∈ C 1 satisﬁes (F0), (F1), (F2), and N (cid:62) 2. Then for any n ∈ N0
and any ε > 0 such that ε < ( f (cid:48)(u0)− 1)/λ rad
n+1(BR), Problem (Pε) has at least n distinct
non-constant radial solutions.

If we assume further that f has a subcritical growth, then we can prove the existence of
more solutions, at least 2n actually, as in the case of a pure power. Theorem 1.4 should be
compared with [52]. Since we deal with a radially symmetric domain, we are able to go
much deeper into the bifurcation analysis. Except from the restrictive assumption on the
domain, our assumptions on the nonlinearity f are quite general. In particular, f can have
a fast growth at inﬁnity. Notice also that Theorem 1.4 is not of perturbative nature since
we precisely characterize the values of ε at which new solutions arise. The conclusion of
Theorem 1.4 can be made more precise when f (s) = sp, see [48, Theorem B] which will
be discussed in Section 4.

We also emphasize that our solutions do not display interior concentrations as ε → 0
in opposition to e.g. [22, 32]. Actually, our families of solutions correspond to boundary
clustered layer solutions, that is solutions with many local maxima accumulating on the
boundary when ε → 0. In particular, the bifurcation analysis provides an easy approach

6

D. BONHEURE, C. GRUMIAU, C. TROESTLER

to ﬁnd the boundary clustered layer solutions of [5, Corollary 1.3] and [44, Theorem 1.1].
In fact, the bifurcation analysis gives the complete picture of radial clustering solutions
completing those obtained in [5, 44]. For results in that direction in a non symmetric
setting, we refer to [24, 42, 43, 45].

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deals with a priori bounds, both with or
without assuming radial symmetry, which are crucial in the bifurcation analysis of (Pλ ,p).
In Section 3, we ﬁrst give a general insight on the bifurcation analysis and then a reﬁned
analysis of the radial bifurcations when Ω is a ball leads to Theorem 1.1. In Section 4, we
prove Theorem 1.4. Section 5 deals with the qualitative properties of the least energy so-
lutions in a ball. Finally, Section 6 contains numerical simulations and further conjectures.

2. A PRIORI ESTIMATES

In this Section, we derive a priori estimates on positive solutions. These are helpful
to control the norm of the solution along the branches bifurcating from the constant so-
lution. Of course, the dependence on the bifurcation parameter is important and will be
emphasized. We start with a uniform L1 bound.
Lemma 2.1. Any nonnegative solution u of (Pλ ,p) satisﬁes

u (cid:54) λ (p−1)/(p−2)|Ω|.

up−1 = λ(cid:90)Ω
(cid:90)Ω
(cid:90)Ω
up−1 = λ(cid:90)Ω

Proof. Integrating the equation leads to λ(cid:82)Ω u =(cid:82)Ω up−1. Hölder inequality implies

u (cid:54) λ|Ω|1− 1

p−1(cid:107)u(cid:107)p−1,

so that the claim follows.

(cid:3)

This L1 bound can be improved through a bootstrap argument.

Proposition 2.2. Assume 2 < ¯p < 2∗. There exists C ¯p > 0 such that any nonnegative
solution to (Pλ ,p) with λ = 1 and 2 < p (cid:54) ¯p satisﬁes

max(cid:8)(cid:107)u(cid:107)H1,(cid:107)u(cid:107)L∞(cid:9) (cid:54) C ¯p.

(2.1)
Proof. Assume ﬁrst 2 < ¯p < (2N−2)/(N−2) and consider a family (up)p∈]2, ¯p] of positive
solutions. We argue as in Ni and Takagi [52]. From the L1 bound on up−1
, by an elliptic
regularity result of Brezis-Strauss [15], we deduce a bound for (up) in W 1,q with 1 (cid:54)
q < N/(N − 1). Sobolev embeddings give a bound in Lr0 for 1 < r0 < N/(N − 2) and
therefore, by the standard elliptic regularity theory, in W 2,r0. We then bootstrap to increase
the regularity. If (up) is bounded in W 2,rn with 1 < rn < N/2 then (up) is bounded in
W 2,rn+1 with

As ¯p < 2N−2
N−2 > 1. Taking n large enough and choosing r0 adequately, one
deduces that (up) is bounded in W 2,rn with rn > N/2 and therefore in the desired spaces.
Let now 2 < p < ¯p < 2∗. It remains to prove that a family (up)p∈[p, ¯p] of positive solu-
tions satisﬁes (2.1). We follow the classical blow-up approach of Gidas-Spruck [29], so we
will only sketch the argument. Let us argue by contradiction and suppose on the contrary
that there exists a sequence of exponents (pn) ⊆ [p, ¯p] and a sequence of positive solutions
(upn) such that (cid:107)upn(cid:107)∞ → +∞. One can assume that pn → p∗ (cid:62) p > 2. Let xn be a point
where upn achieves its maximum. Deﬁne

y + xn(cid:1), where µn := 1/(cid:107)upn(cid:107)L∞ → 0.

with Neumann boundary conditions. By elliptic regularity, (vn) is bounded in W 2,r and
C 1,α, 0 < α < 1 on any compact set. Thus, up to a subsequence and a rotation of the
domain, one concludes that

vn → v∗

where the choice between the two possibilities for Ω∗ depends on the limit of the ratio
dist(xn,∂Ω)/µ (pn−2)/2

in W 2,r and C 1,α on compact sets of Ω∗ = RN or RN−1 × R>a∗,
. Clearly, one has v∗ (cid:62) 0, v∗(0) = 1 = (cid:107)v(cid:107)L∞ and v∗ satisﬁes
in RN−1 × R>a∗,
in RN

or

∂Nv∗ = 0

Liouville theorems [29, 67] imply v∗ = 0 which contradicts v∗(0) = 1.

(cid:3)

This a priori estimate allows to conclude that for p close to 2, the constant u0 = 1
is the unique solution of (Pλ ,p) with λ = 1.
In fact, it will be clear that even if u is
nonnegative and solves the equation with Neumann boundary conditions, it has to be the
constant solution. The argument is again inspired from Ni and Takagi [52].
Theorem 2.3. Let Ω be a smooth bounded domain in RN. There exists ˜p = ˜p(Ω) > 2 such
that, if 2 < p (cid:54) ˜p, the sole nonnegative solutions to Problem (Pλ ,p) with λ = 1 are the
constant functions 0 and 1.
Proof. Let u (cid:54)= 0 be a nonnegative solution to (Pλ ,p) and write u = ¯u + ˜u where ¯u denotes
the average of u on Ω so that ˜u has zero mean. Multiplying the equation by ˜u and integrating
gives

As ˜u has zero mean, the left-hand side satisﬁes

(cid:90)Ω|∇ ˜u|2 +| ˜u|2 =(cid:90)Ω

( ¯u + ˜u)p−1 ˜u =(cid:90)Ω(cid:16)(cid:90) 1

0

(p− 1)( ¯u + s ˜u)p−2 ˜u2 ds(cid:17).

On the other hand, for any ﬁxed 2 < ˜p < 2∗, it follows from Proposition 2.2 that ¯u + s ˜u is
uniformly bounded where the bound depends neither on p ∈ ]2, ˜p] nor on s ∈ [0,1]. Taking
˜p smaller if necessary, we may assume that for every s ∈ [0,1] and any 2 < p (cid:54) ˜p,
We thus deduce that, for p (cid:54) ˜p, ˜u = 0.
Next we consider radial solutions of

(p− 1)( ¯u + s ˜u)p−2 < λ2 + 1.

(cid:3)

It is observed in [12] that radially increasing solutions are a priori bounded in L∞. We now
show that an a priori estimate holds true as soon as u(0) < 1.
Theorem 2.4. If u is a classical radial solution to Problem (PR,p) such that u(0) < 1, then

(cid:107)u(cid:107)∞ (cid:54) exp(1/2) and (cid:107)∂ru(cid:107)∞ (cid:54) 1.

Proof. In radial coordinates, where (cid:48) denotes ∂r, the equation (PR,p) writes

u(cid:48) + u = |u|p−2u

As soon as an L∞ estimate holds true, we essentially have a bound in any topology

Corollary 2.5. For every k (cid:62) 0 and q (cid:62) 1, there exists C > 0 such that if u is a classical
radial solution of Problem (PR,p) satisfying u(0) < 1, then

The next lemma is in the spirit of [38, Lemma 3.5]. It will be useful in the bifurcation

analysis.
Lemma 2.7. Assume f is continuous, (F0), and (F2) holds. Then there exists ε > 0 such
that if u is a non constant nonnegative classical radial solution of Problem (Pε) with
ε (cid:62) ε, then u(0) > u0.
Proof. Assume by contradiction that u(0) (cid:54) u0 and u is not constant. Proposition 2.6
implies that u is uniformly bounded for ε (cid:62) 1. Writting u = ¯u + ˜u and multiplying the
equation by ˜u, we get

Since u is a priori bounded, we infer that there exists C > 0 such that

f (u) ˜u.

ε(cid:90)BR |∇ ˜u|2 +(cid:90)BR | ˜u|2 =(cid:90)BR
ε(cid:90)BR |∇ ˜u|2 (cid:54) C(cid:90)BR | ˜u|2,

which obviously implies that ˜u = 0 when ε > λ2/C, whence a contradiction.

3. BIFURCATION ANALYSIS

Since u is a solution of (Pλ ,p) on Ω iff x (cid:55)→ λ−1/(p−2)u(x/√λ ) solves (P1,p) on Ωλ :=
√λ x | x ∈ Ω}, we can ﬁx λ = 1 so that u = 1 is a solution of (Pλ ,p). We consider the

{
solvability of

(cid:40)−∆u + u = |u|p−2u,

∂νu = 0,

in Ω,
on ∂Ω,

(P1,p)

and we will check the positivity of the solutions a posteriori. The solutions to Problem
(P1,p) with 2 < p < 2∗ can be seen as the zeros of the Fréchet differential of the functional

i.e., the zeros of the map

where the linear map E (cid:48)p(u) : H1(Ω) → R : h (cid:55)→ E (cid:48)p(u)[h] is given by
∇u∇h + uh−(cid:90)Ω|u|p−2uh.

E (cid:48)p(u)[h] =(cid:90)Ω

We consider p as a unknown in the problem and we investigate the bifurcation points along
the trivial solution curve {(p,1) : p > 2} ⊆ R+ × H1(Ω) to (P1,p). We recall that a point
(p∗,1) is called a bifurcation point if every punctured neighborhood of (p∗,1) contains a
solution of (P1,p). The Implicit Function Theorem implies that if (p∗,1) is a bifurcation
point, then the map

H1(Ω) → (H1(Ω))(cid:48) : ϕ (cid:55)→ E (cid:48)(cid:48)p∗(1)[ϕ,_],
where E (cid:48)(cid:48)p∗(1)[ϕ,_] : H1(Ω) → R : ψ (cid:55)→ E (cid:48)(cid:48)p∗(1)[ϕ,ψ] is given by
∇ϕ∇ψ + (2− p∗)(cid:90)Ω
E (cid:48)(cid:48)p∗(1)[ϕ,ψ] =(cid:90)Ω

is not an isomorphism. This is the case if and only if

ϕψ,

p∗ = 2 + λi(Ω),

for some i > 1,

(3.1)
where 0 = λ1(Ω) < λ2(Ω) < ··· are the eigenvalues of the operator −∆ with Neumann
boundary conditions in Ω.
Thanks to the fact that the problem has a variational structure, the converse is also
true [9, 37, 46, 57], see also [16, 47]. Namely, if p∗ satisﬁes (3.1), then (p∗,1) is a bifur-
cation point. Moreover, standard arguments in degree theory imply that there is actually a
continuum of nontrivial solutions when the dimension of the eigenspace for λi(Ω) is odd.
A continuum B of nontrivial solutions which cannot be extended (i.e., a connected com-
ponent) is called a branch. If B (cid:51) (2 + λi,1), we say that B bifurcates from (2 + λi,1). In
this case, Rabinowitz’s principle [58] applies: a branch B bifurcating from (2 + λi,1) is
unbounded in R× H1 or there exists an eigenvalue λ j (cid:54)= λi such that (2 + λ j,1) ∈ B (in
which case we say that the branch is linked by pair).
In order to be able to establish more properties of the bifurcating branches, we now
restrict ourselves to the case where Ω is a ball BR of radius R. Then, one has a precise
knowledge of the eigenspaces of −∆ which makes the analysis much simpler.
We already know that the ﬁrst eigenvalue3 λ1 equals 1 and any associated eigenfunction
|x| ∈ SN−1. By the method of separation of variables, one
is constant. Let r = |x| and θ = x
concludes that all eigenfunctions of −∆ with Neumann boundary conditions have the form
(3.2)
Jν is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of order ν, and Pk : RN → R is an harmonic
homogenous polynomial of degree k for some k ∈ N. To satisfy the boundary conditions,
the corresponding eigenvalue λi (cid:62) 0 of −∆ must be such that √λiR is a root of the map
In other words, each of the inﬁnitely many real roots zk,(cid:96), (cid:96) (cid:62) 1, of this function gives
rise to the eigenvalue z2
k,(cid:96)/R2 of −∆. Radial eigenfunctions correspond to k = 0. For each
eigenspace Ei, the dimension of its intersection with radial functions is 0 or 1. Moreover,
for functions in Ei with k = 0, one notices that the zeros of those functions are simple.

The remaining of this section is devoted to the study of radial bifurcations. We say that
(p∗,1) is a radial bifurcation point if every punctured neighborhood of (p∗,1) contains
radial solutions. In the sequel, we denote by 0 = λ rad

of −∆ whose eigenspaces contain radial eigenfunctions.

the bifurcations branches from (2 + λ rad
Rabinowitz theorem [20, Theorem 1.7 and 1.18] (see also [6]) in a form that we recall
ﬁrst.
Proposition 3.1 (Crandall-Rabinowitz). Let X and Y be two Banach spaces, p∗ ∈ R and
u∗ ∈ X. Assume F : R× X → Y : (p,u) (cid:55)→ F(p,u) is such that
(i) F(p,u∗) = 0 for any p in a neighborhood of p∗;
(ii) the partial derivatives ∂pF, ∂uF and ∂puF exist and are continuous in a neighborhood

i

of (p∗,u∗);

(iii) ker(cid:0)∂uF(p∗,u∗)(cid:1) is one-dimensional and is thus spanned by some ϕ∗ ∈ X \{0};
(iv) Im(cid:0)∂uF(p∗,u∗)(cid:1) has codimension 1 and is thus the kernel {y ∈ Y : (cid:104)ψ,y(cid:105) = 0} of

some continuous linear functional ψ : Y → R.

Then the following assertions hold.
(1) If

a := (cid:104)ψ,∂puF(p∗,u∗)[ϕ∗](cid:105) (cid:54)= 0,

then (p∗,u∗) is a bifurcation point for F. In addition, the set of nontrivial solutions
of F = 0 in a neighborhood of (p∗,u∗) is given by a unique continuous curve s (cid:55)→
( ¯p(s), ¯u(s)) deﬁned for s close to 0. More precisely ( ¯p(0), ¯u(0)) = (p∗,u∗), ¯u is of
class C 1, ∂s ¯u(0) = ϕ∗, and, for all (p,u) in a neiborhood of (p∗,u∗),

(cid:0)F(p,u) = 0∧ u (cid:54)= u∗(cid:1) ⇔ ∃s (cid:54)= 0, (p,u) = ( ¯p(s), ¯u(s)).

u F exists and is continuous, the curve is of class C 1.

where X : [0, +∞[ → [0, +∞[ is such that X(0) = 0 and ∂tX(t) = pν (X(t)) > 0. Since
the sine function is periodic, it is enough to show that t (cid:55)→ (X(t))α−β /2 p1+β /2
(X(t)) is
decreasing because then the integral on the interval [2kπ, (2k + 1)π] will be greater than
the negative contribution in the next interval [2(k + 1)π, (2k + 2)π]. As the function X is
increasing, it is equivalent to show that x (cid:55)→ xα−β /2(cid:0)pν (x)(cid:1)1+β /2 is decreasing, or, setting
γ = (α − β /2)/(1 + β /2), that x (cid:55)→ xγ pν (x) is decreasing.

According to formula (10.9.30) of [55], we have

pν (x) = 4

cosh(2νt)K0(2xsinht)dt

(3.10)

where K0 is the second modiﬁed Bessel function. We have to distinguish between ν > 1/2

If ν = 1/2, pν (x) = 1 for all x > 0 (see e.g. (10.43.18) in [55]). It follows that the map
(cid:3)

The function t (cid:55)→ cosh(2νt)/cosht is increasing. Therefore the ﬁrst term of the product is
a decreasing function of x. As K0 > 0, so is pν. It is therefore sufﬁcient that γ (cid:54) 0 in this
case.
x (cid:55)→ xγ pν (x) is decreasing iff γ < 0.
Remark 3.3. When ν = 1/2 (i.e., N = 3 for our application in upcoming Theorem 3.5),
Jν (x) =(cid:112)2/(πx)sinx and so the statement simpliﬁes to
which is true as soon as x (cid:55)→ xα−β /2 is decreasing. This is the only case where the as-
sumptions of Lemma 3.2 are sharp: for ν > 1/2, the statement (3.8) remains true for some
α > β /2.
Remark 3.4. When ν = 0 (i.e., N = 2 for our application), although p0 is increasing and
an asymptotic analysis around 0 shows that xγ p0(x) is not decreasing whatever γ, numerics
indicate that (3.8) is positive at least if α < 0.45β − 0.15, and in particular in the case of
interest for Theorem 3.5: α = 1− ν = 1 and β = 3.

so that the (3.8) holds true for x large enough in the case α = 1− ν and β = 3.

4Since, when ν > 0 (resp. ν = 0), pν (x) behaves like x1−2ν (resp. xln2 x) as x → 0, the function 1/pν (x) is

integrable in a neighborhood of 0 for ν (cid:62) 0.

With Lemma 3.2 at hand, we can prove the following.

are increasing (resp. decreasing), at least when p is close enough to 2 + λ rad

Observe that for i = 2, the functions on the branch emanating to the right (resp. left) of
2 + λ rad
. We
will prove later on that this holds actually along the whole branch. Some parts of the proof
follow from nowadays standard arguments. We give them for completeness.
Proof. (i) Since a (cid:54)= 0, Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem 3.1 implies that (2 + λ rad
,1) is a
continuous bifurcation point for F. In addition, the set of non-trivial solutions of F = 0 is
composed locally of a unique curve of class C 1. Hence (i) holds.

(ii) Let Bi ⊆ R × ˜C 2,α

rad be the continuum that branches out from (2 + λ rad

,1), Bi :=
i
Bi \{(2 + λ rad

to 1 in the C 2 topology, so that u is clearly positive. Let ˜p > 2 be given by Theorem 2.3.

2 > 2. We claim that
p > ˜p and u > 0.

∀(p,u) ∈ Bi,

By connectedness, if the claim does not hold, there exists, on the continuum Bi, a nonneg-
ative solution u to (P1,p) such that p = ˜p or u vanishes at at least one point. In the ﬁrst
case p = ˜p, Theorem 2.3 implies that u ≡ 1 or u ≡ 0 but this is impossible since neither
( ˜p,1) nor (p,0), p ∈ ]2, +∞[, are bifurcation points of F. We can therefore suppose that
p > ˜p, u (cid:62) 0 and u (cid:54)≡ 0. If the set {r ∈ [0,R] | u(r) = 0} contains a point r0 ∈ ]0,R], then
u(cid:48)(r0) = 0 because r0 is either an interior minimum or the boundary condition holds. The
local uniqueness of the solution for the Cauchy problem (2.2) with initial data u(r0) = 0,
u(cid:48)(r0) = 0 now implies u ≡ 0 which is a contradiction. It remains to deal with the case
where {r ∈ [0,R] | u(r) = 0} = {0}. Choose s > 0 small enough so that u(r) < 1 for all
r ∈ [0,s]. We claim that u(cid:48) > 0 on ]0,s]. Because u > 0 on ]0,s], there are points r arbitrar-
ily close to 0 such that u(cid:48)(r) > 0. It is thus sufﬁcient to show that u(cid:48)(r) (cid:54)= 0 for r ∈ ]0,s].
Notice that, in view of equation (2.2),

for all r ∈ ]0,s], u(r) ∈ ]0,1[ and u(cid:48)(r) = 0 implies u(cid:48)(cid:48)(r) > 0.

Suppose that, on the contrary, u(cid:48) vanishes at t ∈ ]0,s]. Using (3.11) with r = t, one deduces
that the maximum of u over [0,t] occurs at some interior point r1 ∈ ]0,t[ such that u(cid:48)(r1) = 0
and u(cid:48)(cid:48)(r1) (cid:54) 0. This contradicts (3.11) and thus we indeed have u(cid:48) > 0 on ]0,s]. Now,
remember that, because u describes the proﬁle of a radial function, u(cid:48)(0) = 0. Therefore,
for all r ∈ [0,R], h(r) (cid:54) h(0) = 0 where h is deﬁned by (2.4). This implies
(u(cid:48))2 (cid:54) u2 − 2
and thus u(cid:48) (cid:54) u on ]0,s[. Using Gronwall’s inequality, one concludes u(r) (cid:62) u(s)er−s for
all r ∈ [0,s] which is a contradiction when r = 0.
(iii) The bifurcation is transcritical if b (cid:54)= 0, where b is deﬁned by (3.7). Taking the
explicit form of the eigenfunctions, and integrating in spherical coordinates, one ﬁnds that
b (cid:54)= 0 if and only if

p up (cid:54) u2

|x|). In view of equation (10.7.3) of [55], ϕi(0) > 0.
Using the fact that b < 0 and the asymptotic expansion of the branches (3.5), one concludes
that, in a neighborhood of (2 + λ rad
,1), the functions on the branch emanating to the right
(resp. left) of 2 + λ rad
satisfy u(0) < 1 (resp. u(0) > 1). This property remains true along
the whole branch. Indeed, since the function h deﬁned by (2.3) is non-increasing, one
sees that u(0) (cid:54)= 1 otherwise u is the constant solution u ≡ 1 which does not belong to the
(cid:3)
branch Bi.
Remark 3.6. In contrast with Theorem 3.5, the bifurcation points for the one-dimensional
case are always supercritical. On BR = ]−R,R[, all eigenvalues are simple. Let ϕi be
a i th eigenfunction, sorted so that the corresponding eigenvalues λi are increasing, and
normalized so that (cid:107)ϕi(cid:107)L2 = 1. As before, we take (cid:104)ψ,v(cid:105) :=(cid:82)BR vϕi. Elementary but

When N = 2, we conjecture Theorem 3.5 remains but we have to leave that as an open
question for which a positive answer is strongly supported by the numerical computations.
We can state the following weaker result.
Theorem 3.7. Assume Ω = BR and N = 2. For every i (cid:62) 2, (pi,u0) := (2 + λ rad
,1) is a
bifurcation point in ˜C 2,α (BR) of Problem (P1,p). Denote Bi the branch bifurcating from

(iv) if i is large enough, then the bifurcation from (2 + λ rad

,1) is transcritical and the

characterization of the branch stated in assertion (iii) of Theorem 3.5 holds.

i

Proof. The ﬁrst two assertions follow as in the proof of Theorem 3.5. Assertion (iv) is a
consequence of Remark 3.4. Finally, Theorem 3.1 asserts that the curve s (cid:55)→ ( ¯p(s), ¯u(s))
locally giving the bifurcation branch around (2 + λ rad

,1) is such that

i

¯u(s) = 1 + sϕi + o(s)

where ϕi can be chosen so that ϕi(0) > 0. Thus, u(0) > 1 when s > 0 and u(0) < 1 when
s < 0. The same argument as for Theorem 3.5 implies that these properties are preserved
(cid:3)
along the corresponding continuums.
3.2. Properties of the solutions along the branches. In this subsection, we ﬁrst show
that the branches Bi are unbounded and that they do not cross. We introduce the following
deﬁnition which is intended to distinguish the solutions bifurcating at (2 + λ rad
Deﬁnition 3.8. A positive radial solution u is of type i if and only if the number of zeros of
r (cid:55)→ u(r)− 1 is the same as the number of zeros of ϕi, the radial eigenfunction associated
to λ rad
. If u is of type i and u(0) > 1 then we say that u is of type i+ while if u(0) < 1, we
say that u is of type i−.

Proof. We know that the branches are unbounded in R× C 2,α

prove the second possibility, it is enough to prove that along Bi, the solutions are of type i.
Let (p,u) ∈ Bi. We know that p > 2 + ε and as observed in the proof of statement (iii) of
Theorem 3.5, u(0) (cid:54)= 1. Moreover, as u is a solution of the ODE
∂ru + u = |u|p−2u,

(3.13)
which also possesses the constant solution 1, the roots of u − 1 are simple. Therefore,
the number of roots of u− 1 along the C 2,α-continuum Bi cannot change. To prove that
the number of roots of u− 1 is the same as ϕi, we consider a sequence(cid:0)(pn,un)(cid:1)n ⊆ Bi
,1) in R× C 2,α and we set vn := (un − 1)/(cid:107)un − 1(cid:107)C 2,α . Due to the
converging to (2 +λ rad
fact that the embedding C 2,α (cid:44)→ C 0,α is compact, one can assume that vn → v∗ in C 0,α.
Recalling that un > 0, the equation for vn can be written as
vn = (−∆ + 1)−1 upn−1
i + o(1))vn + O((cid:107)un − 1(cid:107)C 0,α )(cid:1).
Since the inverse of the −∆ + 1 is continuous, one deduces that the convergence vn → v∗
actually occurs in C 2,α, thus (cid:107)v∗(cid:107)C 2,α = 1 and v∗ is a radial eigenfunction of −∆ with
eigenvalue λ rad
. By simplicity, v∗ is a multiple of ϕi and has the same number of zeros.
Since these zeros are simple, vn also has the same number of zeros as v∗ for n large. This
(cid:3)
completes the proof.

Theorem 3.10. Let N (cid:62) 3. The set Bi consists of two branches B±i such that

close to the bifurcation point, the solutions u are of type i−, u(0)
is a global minimum, u has exactly i critical points which are all non degenerate local

strictly smaller (resp. larger) than the previous one.

Proof. The proof is a simple consequence of the previous statements and of standard ODE
(cid:3)
arguments based on the energy dissipation (2.3).
Remark 3.11. The same result holds for N = 2 except that we do not know how the
branches B±i behave for p close to 2 + λ rad

Note that on the ﬁrst bifurcation, the solutions are increasing on one part of the branch
and decreasing on the other part. On the other branches, the solutions are oscillating
around 1 with a “decreasing envelope”.
3.3. Degeneracy and multiplicity. We now collect some of the consequences of the bi-
furcation analysis. In particular, the a priori estimates given in Section 2 lead to further
qualitative results. We recall that a positive solution u0 of (P1,p) is said to be degenerate
if there exists v (cid:54)= 0 such that

(cid:40)−∆v + v = (p− 1)|u0|p−2v,

Observe that λ rad

or, equivalently, if the kernel of ∂uF(p,u0) is larger than {0}.
Proposition 3.12. Let N (cid:62) 3, Ω = BR, and i (cid:62) 2. If 2 + λ rad
admits a degenerate positive radial solution of type i+ for some p = pi ∈ ]2,2 + λ rad
Proof. We know that statement (iii) of Theorem 3.5 holds. On B+
i , the branch starting from
the left of (2 + λ rad
,1), the solutions are a priori bounded as long as p < 2∗ (see Propo-
sition 2.2). On the other hand, we know that the branch is unbounded (for the topology
of R× C 2,α) and that p (cid:62) 2 + ε for some ε > 0 that depends only on R. It follows that p
achieves a minimum along the continuum at some value pi (cid:62) 2 + ε. If the corresponding
solution upi was non degenerate, the Implicit Function Theorem would allow to extend the
(cid:3)
branch to the left of pi which is a contradiction.
(BR) < 2∗ − 2 as soon as R is large so that on large balls, there exist
many degenerate positive solutions. These turning points on the bifurcation diagram should
imply a change of Morse index (for instance in the space of radial functions) along the
branches and a change in the minimax property of the solution. This is supported by
the numerical computations of section 6.2. It also implies a local multiplicity result for
solutions of type i+.

In Section 6.3, we also numerically observe that the solution on the unbounded part

concentrate at the origin when p → 2∗. It is therefore natural to conjecture that all these
branches bifurcate from inﬁnity at p = 2∗.
We next derive a global multiplicity result which answers positively a conjecture in [12]
at least in the case of a pure power nonlinearity (we believe that the general case can be
derived with similar arguments). Indeed, assuming

(i) f ∈ C 1(cid:0)[0, +∞),R(cid:1), f (0) = 0 and f (cid:48)(0) = lim

has at least one nonconstant increasing radial solution while the authors conjectured that
there exists a radial solution with k intersections with u0 provided that f (cid:48)(u0) > 1 + λ rad
k+1.
For the pure power nonlinearity f (u) = |u|p−2u, the condition is p− 1 > 1 + λ rad
k+1.
Proposition 3.14. Assume N (cid:62) 2, Ω = BR and n (cid:62) 1. If ¯p ∈(cid:3)2 + λ rad

for all i = 2, . . . ,n + 1, Problem (P1,p) with p = ¯p has at least one non-constant positive
solution of type i−.
Proof. Consider the n branches B−i bifurcating from (2 + λ rad
,1) for i = 2,3, . . . ,n + 1.
Along all the branches B−i , u(0) < 1. Since we have an a priori bound for such solutions
(see Corollary 2.5), the projection of these branches are unbounded in the parameter p.
Thus each of the branches B−i , i = 2, . . . ,n + 1, contains a solution of type i− to Prob-
lem (P1,p) with p = ¯p. These solutions are non-constant and different because they are
(cid:3)

Note that the assumption can be interpreted in term of the size of the ball. Namely, if

Problem (P1,p) possesses at least one non-constant positive solutions of type i− for i =

n+1(BR) < p.

If p < 2∗ we can derive a stronger multiplicity result as the branches B+

Proposition 3.15. Assume N (cid:62) 2, Ω = BR, n (cid:62) 1 and 2+λ rad

Again this result can be interpreted in term of the size of the ball.
The proof of Theorem 1.1 can now be achieved by combining Proposition 3.14, Propo-

sition 3.15 and Corollary 3.13.
Remark 3.16. If Ω is an annulus, Bessel functions of ﬁrst and second kind (see [33]) can
also be used to give a characterization of the eigenfunctions of −∆. Then, one can do the
same bifurcation analysis. Numerical computations show that the corresponding values of
b are not zero, so that we conjecture that the radial bifurcation points are all transcritical.
Since the critical exponent does not play any role here for radial solutions, we can even
prove a priori bounds for p > 2∗ and therefore derive the existence of more solutions in
this region than in the case of the ball.

SEMILINEAR ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS WITH NEUMANN BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

4. SMALL DIFFUSION

In this section, we consider the singular perturbation problem (Pε). As mentioned in
the Introduction, the existence of positive solutions for this problem as ε → 0 has already
been investigated by many authors, essentially by using perturbative methods, and dif-
ferent concentration phenomena have been highlighted, both with and without symmetry
assumptions. Our study here is of a non perturbative nature and gives some insight on
the radial boundary clustered layer solutions obtained via a Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction
in [5,44]. In our analysis, our main goal is not the behavior of the solutions in the singular
limit ε → 0 though we will link our result to the existing literature. We rather focus on the
exact values of ε where new type of radial solutions appear and survive for smaller values
of the diffusion coefﬁcient.

A bifurcation analysis of problem (Pε) was performed by Ni and Takagi [52] in a gen-
eral domain (with a slight reﬁnement on simple rectangles). Since we deal with radial
solutions on a ball, we are able to go much deeper in the analysis of the behavior of the
branches. The radial bifurcation analysis for the problem (Pε) with f (u) = |u|p−2u in a
ball as been performed by Miyamoto [48]. The complete picture is given in [48, Theo-
rem B] when p is supercritical. In that case, all radial regular solutions of (Pε) lie on
branches that bifurcate from the constant solution u = 1. Each branch of solutions (ε,uε )

can be parametrised by(cid:0)ε,uε (0)(cid:1). The other main concern of [48] is a careful analysis
of the upper half-branches of the bifurcation diagram (i.e. the parts of the branches where
uε (0) > 1) when 2∗ < p < 2∗JL where 2∗JL := 2 + 4/(N − 4 − 2√N − 1) if N (cid:62) 11 and
2∗JL := +∞ if 2 (cid:54) N (cid:54) 10, is the critical exponent of Joseph and Lundgren. We will rather
focus on the lower parts of the branches (i.e. the parts of the branches where uε (0) < 1) as
those exist for a wide class of nonlinearity.

In this Section, we only consider radial solutions, so that by a solution of Problem (Pε),

we necessarily mean a radial solution.

Without loss of generality, we assume throughout this section that (F1) is satisﬁed with
u0 = 1, namely f (1) = 1 and f (cid:48)(1) > 1 which in particular implies that u ≡ 1 is a solution
for all ε. We investigate locally the bifurcations from u0 = 1 and then follow some of their
associated global branches. We only focus on the lower part of the branches of solutions,
namely those that survive as ε → 0 without having to impose a growth condition on f
at inﬁnity. We can also easily study the upper part of the branches at the cost of some
additional assumptions on the growth of f at inﬁnity. For instance, we will comment, at the
end of the section, the special case f (u) = up−1 where p is subcritical. On the other hand,
when f has a critical or supercritical growth, the analysis of the upper part of the branch is
much more involved and blow up may occur (and actually does, see [48, Theorem B]) at
some ε∗ > 0.

In the sequel, we assume that f is of class C 1. The assumption f (cid:48)(1) > 1 implies that f
is locally super linear. It will be seen that it is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the
(local) existence of branches of solutions bifurcating from the trivial one at positive values
of the parameter. Since many of the arguments needed to treat Problem (Pε) are similar
to those used in Section 3 and in [48], we will only sketch the arguments in this section.

Consider the map

G : ]0, +∞[× ˜C 2,α

rad → C 0,α

rad : (ε,u) (cid:55)→ (−ε∆ + 1)u− f (u).

Clearly, the function u ∈ ˜C 2,α
rad is a classical solution to Problem (Pε) with Ω = BR if and
only if the couple (ε,u) is a zero of the function G and u > 0. The positivity of u will again
be checked a posteriori. We set

have sign(cid:0)uε (0)− 1(cid:1) = −sign( f (cid:48)(cid:48)(1)), while on the part of the branch bifurcating to the

Still arguing as in Section 3, we can derive further properties of the solutions along the

branches.
Proposition 4.3. Assume N (cid:62) 2, that (F0), (F1) and (F2) hold with u0 = 1. Then all the
branches Ci, i (cid:62) 2, are unbounded and do not intersect each other. Moreover, along Ci, the
solutions are of type i. More precisely,

(i) the solutions on the branch C+

i are of type i+, u(0) > 1 is a global maximum, u has
exactly i critical points which are all non degenerate local extrema, each maxima

larger) than the previous one;

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that due to the assumption (F0), arguing as in Section 3, the solu-
tions remain positive along the branches. The fact that the solutions are of type i and the
behavior of the extrema is also proved as before. The only assertion which deserves maybe
more attention is the fact that ε → 0 along the branch C−i . Since the solutions on C−i are
of type i−, we infer from Lemma 2.7 that there exists ε such that if ε (cid:62) ε, any solution of
type i− is constant. As there always exists an interior point where the solution is above 1
along the continuum, and since the continuum cannot return to the constant solution 1, we
conclude that ε is a priori bounded along the branch C−i . Since the branch is unbounded
and Proposition 2.6 with ε0 = ε provides an a priori bound along the branch, we conclude
(cid:3)
that the branch must contain points (ε,u) for any 0 < ε < εi.

This bifurcation analysis directly leads to the following qualitative and quantitative re-

Again this result can be seen as depending on the size of the ball, namely, for any ε > 0
n+1(B1)/( f (cid:48)(1)− 1), there exists at least one solution of type

sult for Problem (Pε) which is the natural counterpart to Proposition 3.14 for (Pε).

We now show that the branches C−i contain all possible solutions u such that u(0) < 1.

]0,1[,
f (s) (cid:54)= s. If u is a solution to Problem (Pε) such that u(0) < 1, then u lies on a
branch C−i
Proof. Assume u is a solution to (Pε) for some ε > 0 and let γ0 = u(0) ∈ ]0,1[. From our
assumptions, f (γ0) (cid:54)= γ0 and so u is non-constant. Thus [48, Proposition 3.1] — which is
valid for any f of class C 1,1 — says that (ε,u) can be uniquely continued locally: there is
a local C 1 parametrization

for some i (cid:62) 2.

Γ : ]γ0 − η,γ0 + η[ → R+ × C 2 : γ (cid:55)→(cid:0)˜ε(γ), ˜u(γ,r)(cid:1),

where Γ(γ0) = (ε,u), r (cid:55)→ ˜u(γ,r) is the unique solution to (Pε) with ε = ˜ε(γ) and ˜u(γ,0) =
γ. Repeating the same argument, one sees that the map Γ extends to Γ : ]0,1[ → R+ × C 2.
Lemma 2.7 implies that ∀γ ∈ ]0,1[, ˜ε(γ) (cid:54) ε. Assume (we will prove it below) that ˜ε(γ) is
bounded away from 0 as γ → 1. Thus limit points of ˜ε(γ) as γ → 1 exist and they all lie in
[ε,ε ] for some ε > 0. Thanks to Proposition 2.6, for any such limit point ε∗ = limε(γn),
the solutions ˜u(γn,·) converge, up to a subsequence, to a solution u∗ to Problem (Pε) with
ε = ε∗ and u∗(0) = 1. Moreover, as these functions belong to the continuum Γ(]0,1[) and
are solutions of a second order ODE, the number of zeros of ˜u(γ,·)− 1 does not depend
on γ. Thus u∗ = 1 and ε∗ must be the bifurcation value εi for the i (cid:62) 2 for which the
eigenfunction ϕi has the same number of zeros as ˜u(γ,·)−1. So all limit points of ˜ε(γ) are
the same εi and consequently ˜ε(γ) → εi as γ → 1. By local uniqueness near the bifurcation
point, the curve parametrized by Γ coincides with the branch C−i emanating from (εi,1).
To complete the proof, assume by contradiction that there is a sequence of solutions
(εn,un) such that εn → 0, un(0) → 1. As above, the number of zeros of un − 1 is the
same for all n. The convergence un(0) → 1 actually implies the uniform convergence
of un to 1 because of (2.3). Now, as in Ni [49], let us consider the function vn(r) :=
r(N−1)/2(cid:0)un(r)− 1(cid:1). This function solves

bifurcations are excluded, turning points may occur. We strongly believe, and this is sup-
ported by numerics, that uniqueness holds but we have to leave this as a conjecture for
now.

When f (u) = |u|p−2u and p is supercritical, Miyamoto also obtained the classiﬁcation
of the solutions such that u(0) > 1, see [48, Theorem B], leading to the complete picture
of positive solutions. When p is subcritical, we can also complete the classiﬁcation.

Proposition 4.6. Assume N (cid:62) 2, f (u) = |u|p−2u and 2 < p < 2∗. If u is a solution to
Problem (Pε), then either u = 1 or u lies on a branch Ci for some i (cid:62) 2.
Proof. Let u be a solution to (Pε) for some ε > 0 and let γ0 := u(0). If γ0 < 1, then The-
orem 4.5 gives the conclusion. Assume therefore that γ0 > 1. Again, [48, Proposition 3.1]

and then extended as long as we have a priori bounds. It is proved in [39] that there exists
ε0 > 0 such that for ε > ε0, Problem (Pε) only admits the constant solution u = 1. Then, by
Proposition 2.2, we have a priori bounds as long as ε is bounded away from zero. As a con-

implies this solution (ε,u) can be uniquely continued locally as a curve γ (cid:55)→(cid:0)ε(γ),u(γ,r)(cid:1)

u satisfy u(0) → w(0) as ε → 0. This is illustrated by the computer generated Figures 18,

In contrast to the subcritical and supercritical case, as pointed out in the Introduction,
the existence of positive solutions for p = 2∗ depends on the dimension and not only on ε
(or, equivalently, the size of the ball).

Miyamoto proved the branch C−2 is asymptotically made of increasing boundary concen-
trating solutions. Numerical evidence of those facts are shown in Section 6.4.
In the
case f (u) = |u|p−2u, we refer to [5, Corollary 1.3] and [44] for the construction, via a
Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure, of solutions with one or multiple interior layers and to [48,
Corollary 7.11] for the construction of a family of increasing solutions concentrating on
the boundary. The result in [44] is valid in our setting and not only for a pure power.
Combining the arguments of [44] and [48], one should be able to construct, by reduction,
even more solutions, namely solutions with a prescribed number of interior layers and a
boundary layer.

5. SYMMETRY OF LEAST ENERGY SOLUTIONS

When p < 2∗, a least energy solution is a minimizer of the energy Ep on the Nehari

manifold Np deﬁned by

Np :=(cid:8)u ∈ H1 \{0}(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:104)E (cid:48)p(u),u(cid:105) = 0(cid:9) =(cid:110)u ∈ H1 \{0}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:90)Ω|∇u|2 + u2 =(cid:90)Ω|u|p(cid:111).

It is standard to prove that least energy solutions do not change sign. At the critical
exponent p = 2∗, as already mentioned, X. J. Wang [65] also recovered compactness to
get the existence of a positive ground state solution. Remember that u = 1 is the unique
positive solution for p close to 2 whence it is the least energy solution.

We now investigate when the least energy are not constant and if they are radially sym-
metric or not when the domain is a ball. The question of the symmetry breaking has been
tackled by M. Esteban in the case where the domain is the exterior of a ball [19,26,27]. In
this case, the least energy solution is never a radial function, whatever p is.

Concerning the Neumann problem in a ball, Lopes [40] showed that any non constant
radially symmetric critical point of Ep cannot be a local minimizer on Np. This implies that
as soon as we can prove that a least energy solution u is not constant, we have a symmetry
breaking result.

In this section, we adapt the results of A. Aftalion and F. Pacella [4] to the Neumann
boundary condition. We show that a radial positive solution with a Morse index less than
N + 1 must be constant. The method of [4] allows to consider more general assumptions
than in [40] whereas in the setting of [40], this approach provides an alternative proof of
the symmetry breaking.

We ﬁrst observe that least energy solutions of (P1,p) are not constant for p > 2 + λ2.
This is true on a general domain and was already pointed out in [38]. Indeed, by deﬁnition,
the Morse index of a critical point u of the functional Ep corresponds to the sum of the
dimensions of the eigenspaces associated to the negative eigenvalues µ of the problem

(cid:40)−∆h + h− (p− 1)|u|p−2h = µh,

∂νh = 0,

in Ω,
on ∂Ω.

(P(cid:48)p)

With u = 1, the solutions h of Problem (P(cid:48)p) are the eigenfunctions of −∆ associated to the
eigenvalue p− 2 + µ. Therefore, for every i ∈ N\{0}, µi = λi − (p− 2) is an eigenvalue
and its multiplicity is that of λi. This implies that for any i ∈ N\{0}, if λi < p− 2 (cid:54) λi+1,
the Morse index of 1 is equal to ∑k(cid:54)i dimEk.

As least energy solutions have a Morse index equal to 1, the constant solution u = 1
cannot be a least energy solution of (P1,p) when p > 2 +λ2. We next focus on the question
of the symmetry of non constant least energy solutions. We consider the problem

Proof. Let

be the linearized operator around u associated to (P f ). Lemma 5.1 implies the existence of
N linearly independent eigenfunctions ψ∗i (none of which is a ﬁrst eigenfunction) for L with
zero Neumann boundary conditions. We aim to show that the corresponding eigenvalues
µi are negative. If we do so, the proof will be complete because none of the eigenvalues µi
corresponds to a ﬁrst eigenfunction, so the ﬁrst eigenvalue, which is smaller than all µi, is
also negative.

Take i ∈ {1, . . . ,N}. Recall that µi is the ﬁrst eigenvalue of L on Ω+

that u is radial. Now, pick ¯x ∈ Ω+

radially symmetric and not constant. Let D be the connected component of {x| ∂xiu(x)(cid:54)= 0}

Going back to Problem (P1,p), we conclude that, because they have Morse index 1,

cannot be radial in the range 2 + λ2 < p (cid:54) 2∗.

6. NUMERICS, CONJECTURES AND OPEN QUESTIONS

In this section, we complete our theoretical study with some numerical computations.

These lead to some further observations and conjectures.

6.1. Is the ﬁrst bifurcation responsible of the symmetry breaking? We have seen that
the constant state u = 1 is not a least energy solution for p > 2 + λ2. A natural question is
whether 2 + λ2 is optimal. Observe that the ﬁrst bifurcation starting from 1 (which is not
a radial bifurcation) occurs at (p,u) = (2 + λ2,1), see Section 3. It is therefore natural to
think that the solutions along this bifurcation branches provide least energy solutions.

2 , x ∈ BR,

∂νw = 0, x ∈ ∂ BR

In this subsection, we ﬁrst investigate, on a ball BR, whether this bifurcation is super-
critical which is a crucial step to understand the optimality of 2 + λ2.
If we apply the
Proposition 3.1 at the non-radial bifurcation point (p,u) = (2 +λ2,1), we get that b = 0 as
second eigenfunctions of −∆ are odd with respect to a diameter. We thus need to compute
c. We denote the second eigenfunction and eigenvalue of −∆ with Neumann boundary
conditions on B1 by ¯ϕ2 and ¯λ2 = λ2(B1) > 0, ¯ϕ2 being normalized so that (cid:107) ¯ϕ2(cid:107)L2 = 1. Let
w and ¯w be respectively the solutions to

A numerical computation of c leads to Figure 5. One can remark that, for N = 2,
the bifurcation seems to always be super-critical whatever R > 0 is. For larger N, the
computations show that the bifurcation should be super-critical, except for small radii R.
However, for these radii, we have 2 + λ2 > 2∗. Indeed 2 + λ2(R) < 2∗ holds if and only if
one is to the right of the dot on the curve.

Then we easily get that

Therefore, as we expected, the numerical experiments indicate that the bifurcation at
p = 2 + λ2 yields non-radial solutions with energy less than the energy of the trivial solu-
tion 1.

Of course, a bifurcation from the trivial solution u = 1 is not the only mechanism that
can justify the birth of a branch of ground state solutions. Remember that for values of
p close to 2, there is uniqueness of the positive solution and it seems unlikely that a new
branch starts from a degenerate ground state at some p0 < 2 +λ2(BR). Whereas we cannot
exclude that situation a priori, we give a numerical evidence that excludes this issue by
implementing the mountain pass algorithm [18, 68, 69]. For any tested values R > 0 and
p < 2 + λ2, the algorithm ﬁnds the constant solution 1. For our choices of R > 0 and
p > 2 + λ2, the algorithm always ﬁnds a positive non-radial solution with energy less than
the energy of u = 1 (as it it should be from the results of O. Lopes [40]). We display
the outcome of the mountain pass algorithm on Figure 6 (resp. 7) and Table 1 for N = 2,
p = (cid:100)2 + λ2(cid:101) and R = 1 (resp. R = 3). Observe also that the computed solutions look
foliated Schwarz symmetric as they should be [63, 66].

Owing to this foliated Schwarz symmetry, one can also numerically explore the be-

and obviously this implies that ground state solutions are bounded for all p ∈ ]2,2∗[. The
graphs in Figures 8 and 9 support the fact that the ground state solution form a continuum
bifurcating from (2 + λ2,1).

The graphs of some ground state solutions are given by Figure 10. As expected, when

on the x1-axis. We emphasize that for p = 2∗, a least energy solution still exists in H1 as
established by Wang [65].

(a) The constant u = 1 is the least energy solution to (P1,p) if and only if p (cid:54) 2 + λ2. In

this case, there are no other positive solutions.

(b) For p > 2+λ2, least energy solutions belong to the branch bifurcating from p = 2+λ2.
Assertion (a) is supported by the computation of mountain pass solutions. Assertion (b)
is motivated by the numerical evidence that the bifurcation at (2 + λ2,1) is super-critical
and the investigation along the branch of least energy solutions.

Note that Figures 8 and 9 suggest that the branch of ground state solutions exists for all
p ∈ ]2, +∞[. Proving that this is indeed the case would be interesting, see Conjecture 1.2
in the Introduction, and will be the subject of a future project.
6.2. The ﬁrst radial bifurcation. We display in this subsection some numerical com-
putations illustrating the ﬁrst bifurcation in the space of radially symmetric functions.
One naturally expects that on this ﬁrst branch, the solutions are least energy radial so-
lutions, namely least energy solutions among radial functions. This bifurcation arises at
(1,2 + λ rad
is the second radial eigenvalue. The numerics are performed on
a ball of radius R = 4 so that 2 + λ rad
2 < 2∗ for N ∈ {2,3,4}. We recall that this bifurca-
tion is transcritical, as follows from Theorem 3.5. Using the Mountain Pass Algorithm to
approximate the least energy radial solution, one gets (as expected) a decreasing solution
to (P1,p) different from 1 for p (cid:46) 2 + λ rad
, as stated by Theorem 3.5. This solution is
drawn on the left of Figure 11 and its characteristics are given in Table 2. Using a shooting
method, a second positive decreasing solution u2 is found. It is pictured on the right of
Figure 11 and some characteristics are given in Table 2. It has higher energy that both the
previous decreasing solution and u = 1.

results of Section 3, they are positive and possess a single intersection with 1. Moreover,
one solution is increasing along the radius and the other one is decreasing.

local minimizers of E1,p on the Nehari manifold in H1
rad). These solutions still exist in the
supercritical range. The decreasing solutions on Figure 11 and on the left of Figure 12
all belong to the branch emanating to the left of 2 + λ rad
. Before the turning point, they
have a radial Morse index of 2 and have higher energy than 1 (see Figure 14). After the
turning point, their radial Morse index is 1 and, as displayed in Figure 14, they become
radial ground states for slightly greater p.

The above ﬁgures suggest that positive increasing solutions are unique. Increasing solu-
tions must clearly start with u(0) ∈ ]0,1[. As an additional evidence supporting uniqueness,
we have drawn on Figure 15 the time maps

u0 (cid:55)→ TN,p(u0),

where TN,p(u0) is the smaller positive number such that u(cid:48)(cid:0)TN,p(u0)(cid:1) = 0 with u being the
solution to (3.13) such that u(0) = u0. These graphs clearly show that TN,p : ]0,1[ → R is
decreasing and so the equation Tn,p(u0) = R has at most a solution. Therefore uniqueness
holds.

The preceding considerations naturally lead to some additional conjectures.

least energy radial solution becomes non constant at some pc ∈ [ ¯p,2 + λ rad
the constant function λ 1/(p−2).
The non degeneracy and uniqueness of the radial increasing solution is proved for large
p in [10] so that (a) holds true at least asymptotically as p → ∞. The proof relies on a
careful blow up argument which crucially uses the identiﬁcation of a limit problem for
p → ∞.
6.3. Further conjectures and open questions. As proved previously, all branches B−i

A natural question is what happens to the radial branch B+
starting to the left of p =
i
2 + λ rad
(BR). Figures 1, 13 and 16 picture the numerical computation of such branches.
They make clear that when 2 + λ rad
i — which was shown to exist
for all p ∈ [2 + λ rad
i − δi,2∗[ for some δi > 0 — blows up when p → 2∗. The following
conjecture is therefore natural.

Conjecture 6.3. Assume that 2 + λ rad

positive radial solutions of type i+. When p → 2∗, |up|∞ → +∞ and the solution bifurcates

The fact that all branches B+
i

i < 2∗ blow up (as indicated by
Figure 16) also implies that, if 2 + λ rad
n+1 < 2∗, then Problem (Pλ ,p) possesses n positive
solutions (distinguished by the nodal properties of u−1) whenever p is slightly subcritical.
These solution concentrate at 0 when p <−→ 2∗. The existence of one concentrating solution
for slightly subcritical problems was established by O. Rey and J. Wei.
In dimension
three [60], it concentrates at an interior point while, in dimensions four or greater and for
non-convex domains Ω [61], it concentrates on the least curved part of the boundary ∂Ω.
What Figure 16 suggests is that there should actually exist a bubble tower at an interior
point (as was shown for the Dirichlet case [23])

is more tricky when 2 + λ rad

The behavior of the branch B+
i

i > 2∗. We will ﬁrst focus
on the case i = 2. The shape of the branch depends how small the radius R is but also on
the dimension N. On Figure 17, the thick line is the branch bifurcating from (2 + λ rad
,1)
and the thin line is another continuum of positive radially decreasing solutions of type 2+.
These graphs suggest that, when N ∈ {4,5,6}, no matter how large 2 +λ rad
2 > 2∗ is, the left
branch starting from (2 + λ rad
,1) always goes below 2∗, then makes a U-turn and blows
up in L∞ as p → 2∗. Thus this branch always crosses p = 2∗, which implies the existence
of a radially decreasing solution for the critical exponent in accordance with the result of
Adimurthi & S. L. Yadava [2]. In this case, for p (cid:54) 2∗, the behavior of the energy along
the branch behaves as depicted in Figures 13–14: after the turning point, the radial Morse
index changes from 2 to 1 and, for p close enough to 2∗, the branch has lower energy than 1.
These numerical computations thus suggest that, in this case, the solution 1 stops being the
radial ground state before 2∗ and this is not due to a sub-critical bifurcation from 1 but
most likely to a bifurcation from inﬁnity (this is part of the assertion (c) in Conjecture 6.2).
For N = 3 or N (cid:62) 7, Figure 17 shows that when R becomes small, the branch emanating

from (2 +λ rad
,1) does not cross p = 2∗. On the graphs, there is another branch of positive
solutions of type 2+ coming from inﬁnity but this branch must disappear for smaller R
because positive solutions are necessarily constant for a sufﬁciently small radius [2, 3].

i

Figure 16 also indicates is that, for R large enough, the branch B+

i emanating from the
ﬁrst 2 + λ rad
greater than 2∗ is asymptotic to 2∗. Along that branch, the solutions concen-
trate at the origin as p → 2∗. Proving that this behavior indeed takes place would be a nice
complement to results showing the existence of solutions concentrating on the boundary of
the domain as p >−→ 2∗ [24, 25]. In addition (as again illustrated by Figure 17), notice that
the branches bifurcating from higher 2 +λ rad
oscillate around some blow up value p. This
behavior was proved by Miyamoto [48] for (Pλ ,p) but when looking to the bifurcation di-
agram w.r.t. the parameter λ . It would be interesting to perform a similar analysis w.r.t. the
parameter p and analyze the curves in the (λ , p)-plane for which entire singular solutions
exist (which give the values of the asymptotes of the branches of solutions).

6.4. Evidence of concentration for the singular perturbation problem (Pε). In this
section, we compute solutions to problem (Pε) when ε is small. The bifurcation dia-
gram for N = 3, R = 4,
f (u) = |u|u is drawn in Figure 18. Note that, for this f , the
values of ε where bifurcation occurs (see (4.1)) are ε2 ≈ 0.7924, ε3 ≈ 0.2681, ε4 ≈ 0.1346,
ε5 ≈ 0.0809, ε6 ≈ 0.0540, ε7 ≈ 0.0386,... Figure 19 displays solutions for ε = 0.05 on the
branches C±i , i = 2, . . . ,6, and shows that the “bumps” cluster around the boundary. Further
evidence that the oscillations of the radial solutions of type i+ (i (cid:62) 3) and i− (i (cid:62) 2) ac-
cumulate near the boundary as ε → 0 is given by Fig. 20 where solutions on the branches
C±4 are drawn. As a consequence, the bifurcating branches from (εi,1) provide an easy
way to construct clustered layer solutions [44]. Since the cubic nonlinearity is subcritical
in dimension 3, the solutions of type i+ develop a (bounded) peak at the origin as ε → 0,
the proﬁle being asymptotically that of the rescaled ground state solution in R3.
We now examine more complex nonlinearities f which possess ﬁxpoints in the inter-
val ]0,1[ i.e., Problem (Pε) possesses more constant solutions than 0 and 1. Such ﬁx point
will generate an additional homoclinic (asymptotic to this point) for the conservative limit

from reaching the homoclinic asymptotic to 0 as for the pure power nonlinearity.
More speciﬁcally, we consider a function f1 such that u (cid:55)→ F1(u)−u2/2 (where F1(u) =
(cid:82) u
0 f1) possesses a single (necessarily degenerate) critical point in ]0,1[ and f2 such that u(cid:55)→
F1(u)− u2/2 has a local minimum u∗1 and a local maximum u∗2 in ]0,1[. These functions
are pictured on Fig. 21.
The nonlinearities f1 and f2 are chosen in such a way that the bifurcations from 1 occur
for the same εi, i (cid:62) 2, as for the above pure power (p = 3).

For both nonlinearities, Figs. 22–24 show that the solutions bifurcating from 1 behave
similarly to those of the pure power case except that their bumps resemble to the homo-
clinic starting from 0.5 or u∗2. Note that, for f = f1, the speed of concentration of the bumps
is likely to be of order εα for some α > 0 due to the degeneracy of the critical point 0.5
which implies that the associated homoclinic decays like a power.

For f = f1, there are additional solutions u with u(0) ∈ ]0,0.5[. These solutions seem to
come in pairs: for ε > 0 small enough, there are two solutions of type i−, one starting close
to the homoclinic asymtotic to 0 and another one increasing to 0.5 and then resembling the
homoclinic asymtotic to 0.5 before oscillating around 1 (see the right graph of Fig. 23).

FIGURE 23. Non constant radial solutions (N = 3, f = f1, R = 4, ε = 0.02).

For f = f2, the additional numerically computed solutions oscillate around the second
local minimum u∗1 of u (cid:55)→ F2(u)− 1
2 u2 (see Fig. 24). For these solutions, the classiﬁcation
in types i± has to be adapted to count the number of zeros of u− u∗1 with the subscript
± being the sign of u(0) − u∗1. Assuming that f (cid:48)(u∗1) > 1 (i.e., that the minimum u∗1 is
non-degenerate) and following similar arguments to those developed above, one can prove
a multiplicity result such as Corollary 4.4. In this case however, both solutions of type i−
and i+ will keep existing no matter how small ε > 0 is, so, when ε < ( f (cid:48)(u∗1)−1)/λ rad
n+1, one
will actually have at least 2n solutions to Problem (Pε), one for each type i±, 2 (cid:54) i (cid:54) n+1.
