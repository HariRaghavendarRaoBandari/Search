1. Introduction

Grifﬁths

(1971) and Diaconis and Grifﬁths

construct multivariate Krawtchouck
polynomials orthogonal on the multinomial distribution (12) and study their properties. Recent
representations and derivations of orthogonality of these polynomials are in Genest et. al. (2013),
Grunbaum and Rahman (2011), Iliev (2012), Mizukawa (2011).

(2014)

Authors emphasise different approaches to the multivariate orthogonal polynomials.
Diaconis and Grifﬁths’s approach is probabilistic and directed to Markov chain applications; Iliev’s
approach is via Lie groups; and Genest et. al.’s physics approach is as matrix elements of group
representations on oscillator states. Xu (2015) studies discrete multivariate orthogonal polynomials
which have a triangular construction of products of 1-dimensional orthogonal polynomials. These
are particular cases of the polynomials in this paper, see Diaconis and Grifﬁths (2014). These
polynomials extend the Krawtchouk polynomials on the binomial distribution to multi-dimensional
polynomials on the multinomial distribution. They appear naturally in composition Markov chains
as eigenfunctions in a diagonal expansion of the transition functions. There are many interesting
examples of these Markov chains in Zhou and Lange (2009). Binomial and multinomial random
variables can be constructed as a sum of independent identically distributed random variables which
are indicator functions of the events that occur on each of N trials. The Krawtchouk and multivariate
Krawtchouk polynomials are symmetric functions of orthogonal functions sets on each of the trials.
The simplest case is the Krawtchouk polynomials where the representation is explained in Section 3.

In the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials there is not a unique orthogonal function set on trials
with multiple outcomes greater than two, so the polynomials depend on which orthogonal function
set is taken for a basis on the trials.

A well known spectral expansion by Karlin and McGregor 1957a, 1957b, 1958 for the transition

functions {pij(t)}∞

i,j=0 of a birth and death process with rates λi, µi, i = 0, 1, . . . is that

where {Qi}∞
and

πj =

λ0 · · · λj−1
µ1 · · · µj

, j = 1, 2, . . .

In this paper the spectral expansion is extended to composition birth and death processes where there
are N independent and identically distributed birth and death processes operating and {X(t)}t≥0
is such that the ith element {Xi(t)}t≥0 counts the number of processes in state i at time t. In the
analogue of (1) the spectral polynomials are the dual multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials. The
dual polynomial system is therefore very important and attention is paid to describing it.

There are extensions of the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials to multivariate orthogonal
polynomials on the multivariate Meixner distribution and multivariate product Poisson distribution
where they occur as eigenfunctions of multi-type birth and death processes (Grifﬁths 2016).

This paper deﬁnes the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials, summarizes their properties, then
considers how they are found in spectral expansions of composition birth and death processes.
It is partly a review of these polynomials and is self-contained.
For a fuller treatment see
Diaconis and Grifﬁths (2012). The polynomials are naturally deﬁned by a generating function and
so generating functions techniques are used extensively in the paper. Probabilistic notation is used,
and often orthogonal polynomials are regarded as random variables. For example {Kn(X; N, p)}N
are the 1-dimensional Krawthcouk polynomials as random variables and

x(cid:19)px(1 − p)N−x
n(cid:19)pn(1 − p)n, m, n = 0, 1, . . . , N.

A convention of using capital letters for random variables and lower case for values they take is used,
except when the random variables are denoted by Greek letters, when they have to be considered in
context.

2. Bernoulli trials and orthogonal polynomials

The paper begins with expressing the 1-dimensional Krawtchouk polynomials as symmetric
functions of Bernoulli trials. The multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials are extensions of this
construction in higher dimensions.

2.1. Krawtchouk orthogonal polynomials

The Krawtchouk orthogonal polynomials {Kn(x; N, p)}N

n=0 are orthogonal on the binomial

(N, p) distribution

(cid:18)N
x(cid:19)px(1 − p)N−x, x = 0, 1, . . . , N.

They have a generating function

The scaling is such that the polynomials Kn(x; N, p)/n! are monic and

E(cid:2)Kn(X; N, p)2(cid:3) =

N
∑

x=0(cid:18)N
= n!2(cid:18)N

x(cid:19)pxqN−xKn(x; N, p)2
n(cid:19)pnqn.

(3)

If the Krawtchouk polynomials are scaled to be Qn(x) so that Qn(0) = 1, then there is a duality that
Qn(x) = Qx(n). A binomial random variable X counts the number of successes in N independent
trials, each with a probability p of success. Let ξi = 1 if the ith trial is a success and ξi = 0 otherwise.
Then {ξi}N
i=1 is a sequence of Bernoulli trials with P(ξi = 1) = p, P(ξi = 0) = q = 1 − p, and
X = ∑N
It is interesting to express the Krawtchouk polynomials as symmetric functions of
{ξi}N
i=1. If there is just one trial with N = 1, X = ξ1 and the orthogonal polynomial set on X is
{1, ξ1 − p}. There can only be a constant function and a linear function if there are just two values
that ξ1 can take. A product set of orthogonal functions on {ξi}N
i=1{1, ξi − p}, and we want a
condensation of these functions to orthogonal polynomials in X = ∑N

i=1 ξi.

i=1 isNN

i=1 ξi.

Kn(X; N, p) = n! ∑

Proof. A generating function for the symmetric functions on the right of (4) is

i=1(cid:0)1 + z(ξi − p)(cid:1).

If x of the ξi are 1 and N − x are 0, then (5) is equal to

(1 + z(1 − p))X(1 − zp)N−X,

(4)

(5)

identical to the right side of (2). Therefore (4) holds since the generating functions of both sides,
regarding X as a random variable, are the same.

The representation (4) of the Krawtchouk polynomials appears in Diaconis and Grifﬁths (2012)

and may be known before, however it does not appear to be well known.

2.2. Meixner polynomials on the geometric distribution

The Meixner orthogonal polynomials on the geometric distribution are orthogonal on

pqx, x = 0, 1, . . .

Let {ξi}∞

i=1 be a sequence of Bernoulli trials then X counts the number of trials ξi = 0 before the

i=1(1 − ξi)ξ j. X is clearly not a symmetric function of

i=1. The orthogonal polynomials on the geometric distribution are a special case of the general

Meixner polynomials and have a generating function

G(z; x) =

∑
n=0

Mn(x; 1, q)zn = (1 − q−1z)x(1 − z)−(x+1).

A product set of orthogonal functions on the trials is

∞Oi=1

{1, ξi − p}.

(6)

It is of interest to express the orthogonal polynomial set {Mn(x; 1, q)}∞
n=0 as a series expansion in the
product set (6) as a comparision of what happens with the Krawtchouk polynomials. A calculation is

now made of E(cid:2)(ξi1 − p) · · · (ξir − p)G(z; X)(cid:3) leading to coefﬁcients in the expansion of the Meixner

polynomials in the product set of orthogonal functions. Given X = x it must be that ξ j = 0, j =
1, . . . , x, ξx+1 = 1 and {ξ j}∞

j=x+2 are distributed as Bernoulli trials. Therefore

The Krawtchouk polynomials appear naturally as eigenfunctions in an Ehrenfest urn model.
This is explored in Diaconis and Grifﬁths (2012). An urn has N balls coloured red or blue. Transitions
occur at rate 1 when a ball is chosen at random and the colour of the ball is changed according to a
transition matrix

where p, q > 0, p + q = 1 and q ≤ p. Let {X(t)}t≥0 be the number of red balls in the urn at time t.
That is, if a blue ball is chosen it is changed to red with probability 1, whereas if a red ball is chosen
it is changed to blue with probability q/p. {X(t)}t≥0 is a reversible Markov process, which is a birth
and death process, with a Binomial (N, p) stationary distribution.

The process is a composition Markov process in the following sense. Label the balls 1, 2, . . . N at
time 0 and keep the labels over time as their colours change. Let {ξi(t)}t≥0 describe the colour of ball i
at time t: ξi(t) = 1 if the ith ball is red or 0 if the ball is blue. The processes {ξi(t)}t≥0, i = 1, . . . , N are
independent, each has a rate of events 1/N when the speciﬁed ball is chosen, and X(t) = ∑N
i=1 ξi(t).
Denote pij(t) = P(ξk(t) = j | ξk(0) = i), for i, j = 1, 2. Standard Markov process theory gives that

P(t) =" q + pe−λt

q(1 − e−λt)

p(1 − e−λt)

p + qe−λt # ,

(9)

where λ = 1/(N p). It is immediate that the stationary distribution of each of the labelled processes
is (p, q). An eigenvalue-eigenfunction expansion of P(t) is

Pη,ξ(t) = πξ(cid:8)1 + e−λt(pq)−1(η − p)(ξ − p)(cid:9), ξ, η = 0, 1,

(10)

where πξ is the stationary distribution with π0 = q, π1 = p.
agreement with P(t) by substituting the four values of η, ξ = 0, 1.

It is straightforward to check the

In the Ehrenfest urn composition process the transitions are made from X(0) = x to X(t) = y if

The Krawtchouk polynomials thus appear naturally as elementary symmetric functions of the
individual labelled indicator functions in the Markov process.

3. Multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials

The multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials with elementary basis u were ﬁrst constructed by
Grifﬁths (1971). A recent introduction to them is Diaconis and Grifﬁths (2014). They play an
important role in the spectral expansion of transition functions of composition Markov processes.
Khare and Zhou (2009), Zhou and Lange (2009) have many interesting examples of such Markov
processes. Later in this paper we consider the particular composition processes where there are N
particles independently performing birth and death processes.

The multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials are orthogonal on the multinomial distribution

the cases in (26) by (N

3.1. An Ehrenfest urn with d-types

A d-type Ehrenfest urn has N balls of d colours {1, . . . , d}. At rate 1 a ball is chosen and if it is
of type j it is changed to colour l with probability pjl, l = 1, . . . , d. {X(t)}t≥0, with |X(t)| = N, is the
number of balls of the different colours at time t, which can be regarded as a d-dimensional random
walk on |x| = N. The transition functions have an eigenfunction expansion in the multivariate
Krawtchouk polynomials, extending the case (11) with two colours.

Theorem 8. Let {X(t)}t≥0 be a d-dimensional random walk on x, |x| = N, where transitions are made from
x → x − ej + el at rate r(x, x − ej + el) = (xj/N)pjl. P is a d × d transition matrix, with stationary
distribution p such that

pjl = pln1 +

d−1
∑
i=1

Then the transition functions of X(t) have an eigenfunction expansion

(31)

Proof. {X(t)}t≥0 is a reversible Markov process with stationary distribution m(x; p) becuse it
satisﬁes the balance equation

m(x; p)r(x, x − ej + el) = m(x − ej + el; p)r(x − ej + el, x).

The reversibility is a consequence of assuming that P is a reversible transition matrix. The generator
of the process acting on f (x) is speciﬁed by

L f (x) = ∑
j,l

r(x, x − ej + el)(cid:0) f (x − ej + el) − f (x)(cid:1)

so the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (λn, gn(x)) satisfy

Lgn(x) = −λngn(x).

(32)

Now from (29)

i=1(cid:0)ni(1 − ρi)/N(cid:1)Qn(x; u) =

∑
j,l=1

(xj/N)pjlQn(x − ej + el; u) − Qn(x; u)

which is the same as (32), noting that the total rate is 1 away from x. Then (31) holds immediately.

3.2. Extensions to the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials

It is useful in considering spectral expansions of composition Markov processes to allow the

following generalizations of the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials.

• Allow d = ∞ as a possibility and let {u(j)}∞

j=0 be a complete orthogonal set of functions on

p1, p2, . . .. The multinomial distribution is still well deﬁned as

m(x; p) =

N!

x1!x2! · · ·

px1
1 px2

2 · · · , |x| = N,

and the generating function for the multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials still holds with d =
∞.

Version March 2, 2016 submitted to Symmetry

• When d = ∞ take {u(j)}∞

j=1 to be orthogonal on a discrete measure π which is non-negative,

but not a probability measure because ∑∞

i=1 πi = ∞.

• Allow the basis functions u to be orthogonal on π, and take the dual functions {u

i=0 to
be orthogonal on a continuous distribution. An example that occurs naturally in composition
(z), z ≥ 0, i = 0, 1, . . . are the Laguerre polynomials,

Consider a birth and death process {ξ(t)}t≥0 on {−1, 0, 1, . . .} with birth and death rates λi, µi
from state i and transition probabilities pij(t). −1 is an absorbing state which can be reached if µ0 > 0.
We assume that the process is non-explosive so only a ﬁnite number of events will take place in any
ﬁnite time interval. Deﬁne orthogonal polynomials {Qn(z)}∞

n=0 by

− zQn(z) = −(λn + µn)Qn(z) + λnQn+1(z) + µnQn−1(z)

(33)

for n ∈ Z+ with Q0 = 1 and Q−1 = 0. The polynomials are deﬁned by recursion from (33) with Qn+1
deﬁned by knowing Qn and Qn−1. If µ0 = 0, then Qn(0) = 1. There is a spectral measure ψ with
support on the non-negative axis and total mass 1 so that

If µ0 > 0 then ∑∞
j=0 pij(t) < 1 because of possible absorption into state −1. If µ0 = 0 but there is no
stationary distribution because ∑∞
j=0 pij(t) < 1. Placing t = 0 shows
the orthogonality of the polynomials {Qi(z)}i≥0 on the measure ψ because pij(0) = δij. {ξ(t)}t≥0 is
clearly reversible with respect to {πj}j≥0 when a stationary distribution exists, or before absorption
at 0 if it does not exist since πi pij(t) = πj pji(t). As t → ∞ the limit stationary distribution, if µ0 = 0
and ∑∞

Several well known birth and death processes give rise to classical orthogonal polynomials systems.
In this paper only processes where µ0 = 0 are considered so there is no absorbing state at −1 and
the state space is {0, 1, . . .}. Classical papers where theory is developed and particular spectral
expansions are derived are Karlin and McGregor 1957a, 1957b, 1958, 1958, 1965. Schoutens (2000)
details the birth and death processes and spectral expansions nicely, from which we summarize.

• The M/M/∞ queue where λn = λ, µn = nµ, n ≥ 0. The process has a stationary Poisson

distribution

pj = e−λ/µ(λ/µ)j/j!, j = 0, 1, . . .

• The linear birth and death process where λn = (n + β)λ, µn = nµ, with λ, µ, β > 0. The process
arises from individuals which split at rate λ, die at rate µ and immigration of individuals occurs
at rate λβ. Then

• A two urn model with λn = (N − n)(a − n), µn = n(cid:0)b − (N − n)(cid:1), n = 0, 1, . . . , N, a, b ≥ N. The

process arises from a model with two urns with a and b balls, with N tagged balls. At an event
two balls are chosen at random from the urns and interchanged. The state of the process is the
number of tagged balls in the ﬁrst urn. The spectral polynomials are related to the dual Hahn

Qn(x,eu) is a polynomial of degree x1 + x2 + · · · in {Nj}j≥1 whose only term of maximal degree is

. The total degree of Z in the dual polynomials indexed by (x1, x2, . . .) is ∑j≥1 jxj with a single

Proof. The proof of the ﬁrst statement follows from Theorem 5. The proof of the second statement is
immediate by knowing that Nj is of degree j in Z.

The third case of linear birth and death processes composition Markov chains is interesting as
having a continuous spectral measure which is a product measure of N gamma distribution measures.
The spectral polynomials are well deﬁned by a generating function as coefﬁcients of ∏∞

h(v) is a power series in t with h(0) = 1 and u(v) is a power series with u(0) = 0 and u′(0) 6=
0. Meixner (1934) characterizes the class of weight functions and orthogonal polynomials with the
generating function (51). They include the Krawtchouk polynomials, Poisson-Charlier polynomials,
scaled Meixner polynomials, and Laguerre polynomials which occur in the spectral representation of
Karlin and McGregor. The polynomials are additive in the sense that if QN
m (|z|) are the orthogonal
polynomials on the distribution of |Z| then the generating function for these polynomials is

This additivity implies an interesting identity.

Theorem 11. The dual multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials with generating function (49) satisfy the
