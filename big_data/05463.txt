Abstract

The nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equation is considered on a periodic metric graph subject
to the Kirchhoﬀ boundary conditions. Bifurcations of standing localized waves for frequencies
lying below the bottom of the linear spectrum of the associated stationary Schr¨odinger equation
are considered by using analysis of two-dimensional discrete maps near hyperbolic ﬁxed points.
We prove existence of two distinct families of small-amplitude standing localized waves, which
are symmetric about the two symmetry points of the periodic graphs. We also prove properties
of the two families, in particular, positivity and exponential decay. The asymptotic reduction of
the two-dimensional discrete map to the stationary NLS equation on an inﬁnite line is discussed
in the context of the homogenization of the NLS equation on the periodic metric graph.

Introduction

Analysis of the nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) and wave equations with double-well, multi-well,
or periodic potentials constitutes a continuously developing subject [21]. These nonlinear partial
diﬀerential equations (PDEs) have potential applications to many realistic problems such as Bose–
Einstein condensation, nano-technology, and photonic optics.
In many applications, a speciﬁc
waveguide geometry of the spatial domain suggests the use of metric graphs as suitable way to
approximate dynamics of the nonlinear PDEs on such spatial domains [12, 19]. At the vertex
points, where diﬀerent edges of the metric graphs are connected, boundary conditions are given
to deﬁne the coupling between the wave functions along the edges. Kirchhoﬀ boundary conditions
are commonly used to ensure continuity of the wave functions and the ﬂow conservation through
the vertex point [7].

The subject of the NLS and wave equations on metric graphs has seen many developments in
the recent years. At the rigorous mathematical level, the emphasis has been placed on the case
of star graphs, where existence, variational properties, stability, and scattering of nonlinear waves
have been studied, e.g.
in [2, 3, 6]. Nonlinear waves in more complex graphs have been studied
only very recently. Variational results on the non-existence of ground states in unbounded graphs
with closed cycles is given in [4, 5] under a set of certain topological conditions. Bifurcation and
stability of nonlinear waves on tadpole and dumbbell graphs were studied in [9, 17, 20] by using
methods of bifurcation theory.

Periodic metric graphs arise in many contexts such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. Spectral
properties of the periodic graphs were studied in many details [15, 16, 18]. Generalized Floquet–
Bloch theory is introduced for periodic graphs in a similar fashion to the study of Schr¨odinger
operators with bounded periodic potentials [7]. However, the periodic graphs represent a more
challenging and fascinating subject since the eﬀective periodic potentials are deﬁned in spaces
of lower regularity. As a result, more exotic phenomena arise such as the presence of embedded
eigenvalues of inﬁnite multiplicities inside the Floquet–Bloch spectral bands [15, 16]. In our recent
work [11], we showed how to apply the spectral Floquet–Bloch decomposition for the periodic
metric graphs in order to analyze propagation of nonlinear waves on such graphs.

In nonlinear PDEs with smooth periodic potentials, localization of stationary states is quite
common for the frequencies occurring in the spectral gaps of the associated linear operators [21].
Mathematical justiﬁcation of such localized nonlinear waves in the smooth periodic potentials is
now well-understood in the tight-binding approximation [1, 22, 23] and in the envelope approxi-
mation near the spectral edges [8, 10, 13].

In the present work, we are interested to characterize localized stationary states on periodic
metric graphs near the bifurcation points. However, compared to the tight-binding and envelope
approximations, we would like to explore the discrete nature of the periodic graphs. Consequently,
we reduce the existence of localized stationary states in the NLS equation on the periodic graph
to the existence of homoclinic orbits of the two-dimensional discrete map. We will establish the
equivalence between the diﬀerential equations on the periodic graphs and the diﬀerence equations,
which holds for all frequencies below the lowest spectral band of the associated linear operator. In
order to deduce deﬁnite results on existence of localized stationary states on the periodic graphs,
we will use the proximity of the frequencies of the stationary states to those for the spectral edge.

Let us consider the following NLS equation

i∂tu = ∂2

xu + 2|u|2u,

u(x, t) : Γ × R → C,

(1)

on the periodic graph Γ shown in Figure 1. The same periodic graph and its modiﬁcations was
considered in the previous literature within the linear spectral theory of the associated stationary
Schr¨odinger operator [15, 16, 18].

Figure 1: A schematic representation of the periodic quantum graph Γ.

In the recent work [11], using the Floquet–Bloch spectral transform and energy methods, we
have addressed the time evolution problem associated with the NLS equation (1) on the periodic
graph Γ and justiﬁed the most universal approximation of the modulated wave packets given by

2

the homogeneous NLS equation

i∂T Ψ = β∂2

XΨ + γ|Ψ|2Ψ, Ψ(X, T ) : R × R → C,

(2)

where β and γ are speciﬁc numerical coeﬃcients computed by means of the Floquet–Bloch spectral
theory and Ψ is the envelope function in slow spatial and temporal variables (X, T ) for the leading-
order projection to the Floquet–Bloch decomposition.

In the present work, we will consider bound states of the stationary NLS equation

− ∂2

xφ − 2|φ|2φ = Λφ

Λ ∈ R , φ(x) : Γ → R,

(3)

which arise for the standing nonlinear waves u(x, t) = eiΛtφ(x) of the time-dependent NLS equation
(1) on the periodic graph Γ. The stationary NLS equation (3) is the Euler–Lagrange equation of
the energy functional HΛ := E − ΛQ, where

and

E(u) = ZΓ

|∂xu|2dx −ZΓ

|u|4dx

Q(u) = ZΓ

|u|2dx

(4)

(5)

are two conserved quantities in the time evolution of the NLS equation (1). Quantities E and Q
have the physical meaning of the Hamiltonian and mass, respectively. In the deﬁnitions (4) and
(5), the integrals are deﬁned piecewise along each edge of the periodic graph Γ. The critical points
of HΛ are deﬁned in the energy space E given by

E := (cid:8)u ∈ H 1(Γ) :

u ∈ C 0(Γ)(cid:9) .

Here and in what follows, H s(Γ), s ∈ N is deﬁned by using piecewise integration along each edge
of the graph Γ, whereas u ∈ C 0(Γ) means that u is continuous not only along the edges but also
across the vertex points of the graph Γ.

Compared to the weak energy space E, strong solutions of the stationary NLS equation (3) are
deﬁned in the domain space D, which is a subspace of H 2(Γ) closed with the continuity conditions
as well as with the Kirchhoﬀ boundary conditions for derivatives across the vertex points. By
Theorem 1.4.11 in [7], although the energy space E is only deﬁned by the continuity boundary
conditions, the Kirchhoﬀ boundary conditions for the derivatives are natural boundary conditions
for critical points of the energy functional HΛ in the space E. By bootstrap arguments, any critical
point of the energy functional HΛ in E is also a solution of the stationary NLS equation (3) in
D. On the other hand, solutions of the stationary NLS equation (3) in D are immediately the
critical points of the energy functional HΛ. Therefore, the set of bound states of the stationary
NLS equation (3) is equivalent to the set of critical points of the energy functional HΛ.

In the context of the stationary NLS equation (3), we consider small bound states φ ∈ D
bifurcating for small negative Λ. In this asymptotic limit, we prove the existence of two families
of small, positive, exponentially decaying bound states, one of which is centered at the midpoint
of the horizontal link connecting two rings in the periodic graph Γ and the other one is centered
symmetrically at the midpoints in the upper and lower semicircles of one ring, see the periodic
graph Γ in Figure 1. By discrete translational invariance, the two bound states can be translated
to the midpoints of every horizontal link and every ring in Γ.

3

On a technical side, we show that the two families of the bound states can be approximated
by the symmetric solutions of the two-dimensional discrete map. The two distinct families of
bound states of the stationary NLS equation (3) on the periodic graph Γ bifurcate from the point
x in L2(Γ). The
Λ = 0, which coincides with the bottom of the spectrum of the linear operator −∂2
following theorem presents the main result of this work.

Theorem 1.1. There are positive constants Λ0 and C0 such that for every Λ ∈ (−Λ0, 0), the
stationary NLS equation (3) admits two bound states φ ∈ D (up to the discrete translational
invariance) such that

One bound state satisﬁes

and the other one satisﬁes

kφkH 2(Γ) ≤ C0|Λ|1/2.

φ(x − L/2) = φ(L/2 − x),

x ∈ Γ

φ(x − L − π/2) = φ(L + π/2 − x),

x ∈ Γ,

(6)

(7)

(8)

where L is the length of the horizontal link and π is the length of the upper and lower semicircles
in Γ. Moreover, it is true for both bound states that

(i) φ is symmetric in upper and lower semicircles of Γ,

(ii) φ(x) > 0 for every x ∈ Γ,

(iii) φ(x) → 0 as |x| → ∞ exponentially fast.

Remark 1.2. We believe that the bound state satisfying (7) is the ground state of the NLS equation
(1) in the sense that it is a standing wave of smallest energy E at a ﬁxed value of Q in the limit
of small positive Q. Indeed, both bound states correspond to the values of Λ near the bottom of the
spectrum of the linear operator −∂2
x in L2(Γ). Both bound states have properties (ii)–(iii), which
are standard properties of the ground states in the NLS equation. However, in comparison, the
bound state satisfying (7) has a single hump at x = L/2, whereas the bound state satisfying (8) has
two humps at x = L + π/2 in the upper and lower semicircles due to property (i). The bound state
with two humps is expected to have bigger energy E at a ﬁxed value of Q. Thus, we conjecture
that the periodic graph (similar to the tadpole and dumbbell graphs considered in [17, 20]) escapes
the conditions for non-existence of ground states on metric graphs discussed in [4, 5].

Remark 1.3. Using the asymptotic method developed in [17], one can prove existence of two
bound states of the stationary NLS equation (3) in the limit of large negative Λ. One bound state
represents a narrow solitary wave symmetric about L/2. The other bound state represents two
narrow solitary waves symmetric about L + π/2 in the upper and lower semicircles. It becomes
then obvious from the methods developed in [17] that the former solution is a ground state of the
NLS equation (1). Connection between the limits of small and large negative Λ was considered in
[17] numerically for the dumbbell graph. It is suggested by numerical approximations in Section 4
that similar results are expected for the periodic graph Γ.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The linear spectral analysis on the periodic graph
Γ involving a two-dimensional linear discrete map is developed in Section 2. Existence of the two
bound states stated in Theorem 1.1 is obtained in Section 3 by using a two-dimensional nonlinear
discrete map. Properties (i)–(iii) stated in Theorem 1.1 are proved in Section 4 by using geometric
theory of stable and unstable manifolds in two-dimensional discrete maps.

2 Linear discrete map for the spectral problem on Γ

We consider the periodic graph Γ shown on Figure 1 with the circles of the normalized length 2π
and the horizontal links of the length L. Writing the periodic graph as

Γ = ⊕n∈ZΓn,

with

Γn = Γn,0 ⊕ Γn,+ ⊕ Γn,−,

we can parameterize the horizontal links by Γn,0 := [nP, nP + L] and the upper and lower semicir-
cles by Γn,± := [nP + L, (n + 1)P ] for n ∈ Z, where P = L + π is the graph period. For a function
φ : Γ → C, we denote its part on Γn,0 with φn,0 and its part on Γn,± with φn,±.
x is deﬁned on its domain D ⊂ L2(Γ) under two boundary conditions
at the vertex points {nP }n∈Z and {nP + L}n∈Z. We use continuity of the functions at the vertices

The Laplacian operator ∂2

(cid:26) φn,0(nP + L) = φn,+(nP + L) = φn,−(nP + L),

φn+1,0((n + 1)P ) = φn,+((n + 1)P ) = φn,−((n + 1)P ),

and the Kirchhoﬀ conditions for the derivatives of the functions at the vertices

(cid:26) ∂xφn,0(nP + L) = ∂xφn,+(nP + L) + ∂xφn,−(nP + L),

∂xφn+1,0((n + 1)P ) = ∂xφn,+((n + 1)P ) + ∂xφn,−((n + 1)P ).

Remark 2.1. In the literature [15, 16], the periodic graph Γ shown on Figure 1 was directed
diﬀerently compared to the direction used in our work. Figure 2 shows two diﬀerent orientations
of the lower semicircle in the basic cell Γ0. The top panel corresponds to our orientation, whereas
the bottom panel shows the orientation used in [15, 16]. The change in the direction along the
lower semicircle results in the change in the signs of the Kirchhoﬀ boundary conditions (10) but
leads to the same spectral and bifurcation results.

There exist two invariant reductions satisfying the stationary NLS equation (3). The ﬁrst
reduction corresponds to the solutions compactly supported in the circles with zero components
in the horizontal links:

(cid:26) φn,0(x) = 0,

φn,+(x) = −φn,−(x), x ∈ [nP + L, (n + 1)P ],

x ∈ [nP, nP + L],

n ∈ Z.

(11)

It follows that boundary conditions (9) and (10) are satisﬁed for the reduction (11) if and only
if φn,+ satisﬁes the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions at the end points nP + L and
(n + 1)P .

The second reduction corresponds to the solution symmetrically placed in the semicircles:

φn,+(x) = φn,−(x),

x ∈ [nP + L, (n + 1)P ],

n ∈ Z.

(12)

The homogeneous Kirchhoﬀ boundary conditions (9) and (10) can now be closed in terms of only
two components:

and

(cid:26) φn,0(nP + L) = φn,+(nP + L),

φn+1,0((n + 1)P ) = φn,+((n + 1)P ),

(cid:26) ∂xφn,0(nP + L) = 2∂xφn,+(nP + L),

∂xφn+1,0((n + 1)P ) = 2∂xφn,+((n + 1)P ).

The spectral problem associated with the Laplacian operator ∂2

x is given by

− ∂2

xw = λw,

x ∈ Γ.

(13)

(14)

(15)

By Theorem 1.4.4 in [7], the Laplacian operator ∂2
x : D → L2(Γ) is self-adjoint. Therefore, the
values of λ are real. Moreover, integrating by parts and using the boundary conditions (9)–(10),
we conﬁrm that for every w ∈ D ⊂ L2(Γ), we have

λkwk2

L2(Γ) = k∂xwk2

L2(Γ) ≥ 0,

hence, the values of λ are positive. Now, we note an elementary result.

Proposition 2.2. The spectrum σ(−∂2
eigenfunctions w ∈ D ⊂ L2(Γ), which either satisfy the reduction (11) or the reduction (12).

x) in L2(Γ) consists of two parts, which correspond to

Proof. As the linear superposition principle can be applied to the linear homogeneous equation
(15), a general solution of the second-order diﬀerential equation (15) on the periodic graph Γ can
be superposed as the sum of two components, one satisﬁes the reduction (11) and the other one
satisﬁes the reduction (12).

Indeed, for general wn,+ and wn,−, we can present these functions as a sum of symmetric
and anti-symmetric components (the latter ones vanish at the end points of the intervals [nP +
L, (n + 1)P ]). Due to the boundary conditions (9) and (10), the two components generate the
corresponding decomposition of wn,0. The symmetric part of wn,0 satisﬁes (13) and (14), whereas
the anti-symmetric part of wn,0 is identically zero, due to uniqueness of the zero solution of the
second-order diﬀerential equation (15) with zero values both for functions and their derivatives.

By Proposition 2.2, we can search for the eigenfunctions w of the spectral problem (15) sepa-
rately within the reductions (11) and (12). Eigenfunctions satisfying the reduction (11) are given
by

(cid:26) wn,0(x) = 0,
wn,±(x) = ±δn,k sin(m(x − 2πn)), x ∈ [nP + L, (n + 1)P ],

x ∈ [nP, nP + L],

n ∈ Z,

(16)

for ﬁxed m ∈ N and k ∈ Z. There exist countably many eigenfunctions (16) for the same eigenvalue
x) is given by the sequence of eigenvalues {m2}m∈N of inﬁnite
λ = m2. Hence, the ﬁrst part of σ(−∂2
multiplicity.

Eigenfunctions of the diﬀerential equation (15) satisfying the reduction (12) can be represented

in the piecewise form

(cid:26) wn,0(x) = an cos(ω(x − nP )) + bn sin(ω(x − nP )),
wn,±(x) = cn cos(ω(x − nP − L)) + dn sin(ω(x − nP − L)), x ∈ [nP + L, (n + 1)P ],

x ∈ [nP, nP + L],

where the spectral parameter λ is parameterized as λ = ω2, and the coeﬃcients {an, bn, cn, dn}n∈Z
are to be deﬁned from the homogeneous Kirchhoﬀ conditions (13) and (14). Boundary conditions
at the vertices {nP + L}n∈Z yield

(cid:26) cn = an cos(ωL) + bn sin(ωL),
whereas the boundary conditions at the vertices {nP }n∈Z yield
(cid:26) an+1 = cn cos(ωπ) + dn sin(ωπ),

2dn = −an sin(ωL) + bn cos(ωL),

bn+1 = −2cn sin(ωπ) + 2dn cos(ωπ).

(17)

(18)

Eliminating {cn, dn}n∈Z from system (17) and (18), we obtain the two-dimensional linear discrete
map in the matrix form

where the monodromy matrix is given explicitly by

bn+1 (cid:21) = M (ω)(cid:20) an

(21)

Let µ1 and µ2 be the two eigenvalues of M called the Floquet multipliers. Then, µ1µ2 = 1 and
µ1 + µ2 = T , so that we can ﬁnd the spectral bands of the spectral problem (15) in terms of the
parameter λ = ω2 from the condition |µ1| = |µ2| = 1. The standard way of ﬁnding these bands is
to plot the graph of T versus ω and to ﬁnd intervals in ω, where |T (ω)| ≤ 2. Figure 3 shows this
graph for L = π/2. The eigenvalues of inﬁnite multiplicities are shown in black dots. As we can
see, some spectral bands are disjoint from each other with nonempty gaps, whereas some others
touch each other and admit no gap.

Summarizing the previous computations, we identify the spectrum σ(−∂2

x) on L2(Γ).

x) in L2(Γ) consists of eigenvalues {m2}m∈N of inﬁnite
Proposition 2.3. The spectrum σ(−∂2
multiplicity and a countable set of spectral bands {σk}k∈N, which are determined from the condition
T (ω) ∈ [−2, 2], where T (ω) is given by (21) and λ = ω2. Moreover, the eigenvalues of inﬁnite
multiplicity belong to the spectral bands:

m2 ∈ ∪k∈Nσk

for every m ∈ N.

Proof. The ﬁrst assertion follows from Proposition 2.2 and the explicit construction of eigen-
functions described above. In particular, the k-th spectral band σk can be parameterized by a
continuous parameter θ ∈ [−π, π], which arises in the band-limited Fourier transform for bounded
solutions of the linear diﬀerence map (19):

bn (cid:21) = Z π
(cid:20) an

−π(cid:20) ˆa(θ)

ˆb(θ) (cid:21) einθdθ, n ∈ Z,

(22)

such that T (ω) = 2 cos(θ) ∈ [−2, 2].

It remains to prove that eigenvalues {m2}m∈N belong to the union of spectral bands ∪k∈Nσk.

Indeed, substituting ω = m for m ∈ N to (21), we obtain

T (m) = 2(−1)m cos(mL) ∈ [−2, 2].

If | cos(mL)| = 1, then m2 is located at the spectral edge (one of the two end points of the
corresponding spectral band), see m = 2, 4 in Figure 3. If | cos(mL)| < 1, then m2 belongs to the
interior of the corresponding spectral band, see m = 1, 3, 5 in Figure 3.

Remark 2.4. It follows from the graph of T (ω) deﬁned by (21) that the smallest eigenvalue of
inﬁnite multiplicity λ = 1 belongs to the second spectral band if L ∈ (0, π), the third spectral band
if L ∈ (π, 2π), and so on.

Let us simplify T (ω) deﬁned by (21) at the lowest end point λ = 0 of the lowest spectral band

σ1 of the spectral problem (15). Expanding T in powers of ω, we obtain

T (ω) = 2 − ν2ω2 + O(ω4) as ω → 0,

where ν2 := π2 + L2 + 5

2 πL = (L + π/2)(L + 2π) is a numerical constant.

8

Using the band-limited Fourier transform (22), one can parameterize the Floquet multipliers
on the unit circle by µ1 = eiθ and µ2 = e−iθ. Therefore, for small θ, we obtain another expansion

µ1 + µ2 = 2 cos(θ) = 2 − θ2 + O(θ4) as

θ → 0.

Bringing T (ω) = µ1 + µ2 = 2 cos(θ) together, we obtain the asymptotic approximation for the

lowest spectral band of the spectral problem (15) near the lowest end point λ = 0 by

λ(θ) = ν−2θ2 + O(θ4)

as

θ → 0,

(23)

where λ(θ) is a parametrization of σ1.

Remark 2.5. The spectral bands of the spectral problem (15) can also be parameterized by the
Bloch quasi-momentum in the Bloch wave representation of the eigenfunctions w. The Bloch wave
representation is known for the periodic metric graphs [7] and has been explored in our recent work
[11]. In the present paper, we avoid the Bloch wave representation and work entirely with the
two-dimensional discrete maps, which generalize the linear discrete map (19).

3 Nonlinear discrete map for the bound state on Γ

The bound states deﬁned by the stationary NLS equation (3) in D ⊂ H 2(Γ) may bifurcate from
the zero states, when the parameter Λ tends to the points in σ(−∂2
x). Among all possible bound
states, we are interested in the small bound states bifurcating from the bottom in σ(−∂2

x).

It follows from (23) that the lowest spectral band extends from λ = 0 to positive values of
λ. Therefore, we shall now consider bound states of the stationary NLS equation (3) for small
negative Λ. We hence set Λ := −ǫ2 and consider solutions of the stationary NLS equation

∂2
xφ − ǫ2φ + 2|φ|2φ = 0,

φ ∈ D ⊂ L2(Γ).

(24)

As follows from the construction of Propositions 2.2 and 2.3, the lowest spectral band cor-
responds to eigenfunctions of ∂2
x in D satisfying the reduction (12). By Remark 2.4, the lowest
spectral band is disjoint from the lowest eigenvalue λ = 1 of inﬁnite multiplicity that corresponds
to the eigenfunctions of ∂2
x in D satisfying the reduction (11). Therefore, it is suﬃcient to consider
solutions of the stationary equation (24) satisfying the reduction (12).

Our ﬁrst task is to reduce the second-order diﬀerential equation (24) on the periodic graph Γ to
the two-dimensional discrete map. To do so, let us deﬁne a solution ψ(x; a, b, ǫ) of the initial-value
problem on the inﬁnite line:

xψ − ǫ2ψ + 2|ψ|2ψ = 0,
∂2
ψ(0) = a,
∂xψ(0) = b,

x ∈ R,

(25)




where (a, b) are some real-valued coeﬃcients. The following result is well-known for the spatial
dynamical system related to the focusing NLS equation.

Proposition 3.1. For every (a, b) ∈ R2 and every ǫ ∈ R, there is a unique solution ψ(x) ∈ C∞(R)
of the initial-value problem (25).

9

Proof. By the standard Picard methods, a unique local real-valued C 1 solution ψ exists for every
(a, b) ∈ R2 and every ǫ ∈ R. By the conservation of the ﬁrst-order invariant,

E := (∂xψ)2 − ǫ2ψ2 + ψ4 = const,

(26)

the local C 1 solution is extended as a global solution ψ(x) ∈ C 1(R). Moreover, for every x ∈ R,
both ψ(x) and ψ′(x) remain bounded. By bootstrap arguments, the C 1 solution ψ is now extended
as a smooth solution in x since the vector ﬁeld of the diﬀerential equation (25) is smooth in real
variable ψ.

Using the translational invariance and the unique global solution ψ(x) ∈ C∞(R) of the initial-
value problem (25) given by Proposition 3.1, we can now solve the following initial-value problems
on ﬁnite intervals for every n ∈ Z:

xφn,0 − ǫ2φn,0 + 2|φn,0|2φn,0 = 0,
∂2
φn,0(nP ) = an,
∂xφn,0(nP ) = bn



∂2
xφn,+ − ǫ2φn,+ + 2|φn,+|2φn,+ = 0,
φn,+(nP + L) = cn,
∂xφn,+(nP + L) = dn

x ∈ [nP, nP + L],

x ∈ [nP + L, (n + 1)P ],

(27)

(28)

and




where {an, bn, cn, dn} are some real-valued coeﬃcients. By the existence and uniqueness result of
Proposition 3.1 and the translational invariance, we obtain unique solutions of the initial-value
problems (27) and (28) in the following form:

φn,0(x) = ψ(x − nP ; an, bn, ǫ), φn,+(x) = ψ(x − nP − L; cn, dn, ǫ).

(29)

Keeping in mind the reduction (12), we can now satisfy the boundary conditions (13) and (14).

Boundary conditions at the vertices {nP + L}n∈Z yield
(cid:26) cn = ψ(L; an, bn, ǫ),

2dn = ∂xψ(L; an, bn, ǫ),

whereas the boundary conditions at the vertices {nP }n∈Z yield

(cid:26) an+1 = ψ(π; cn, dn, ǫ),

bn+1 = 2∂xψ(π; cn, dn, ǫ).

(30)

(31)

Eliminating {cn, dn}n∈Z from system (30) and (31), we obtain the two-dimensional nonlinear
discrete map in the form

bn+1 (cid:21) = (cid:20) ψ(π; ψ(L; an, bn, ǫ), 1
(cid:20) an+1

2∂xψ(π; ψ(L; an, bn, ǫ), 1

2 ∂xψ(L; an, bn, ǫ), ǫ)

2 ∂xψ(L; an, bn, ǫ), ǫ) (cid:21) .

(32)

Next we establish the reversibility of the two-dimensional discrete map (32) about two natural

centers of symmetries. The ﬁrst symmetry

a−n = cn = ψ(L; an, bn, ǫ),

b−n = −2dn = −∂xψ(L; an, bn, ǫ), n ∈ Z,

(33)

10

corresponds to the solution φ ∈ D of the stationary equation (24) symmetric about the midpoint
x = L/2 in the 0-th central link. The other symmetry

a−n = cn+1 = ψ(L; an+1, bn+1, ǫ),

b−n = −2dn+1 = −∂xψ(L; an+1, bn+1, ǫ), n ∈ Z,

(34)

corresponds to the solution φ ∈ D of the stationary equation (24) symmetric about the midpoint
x = L + π/2 in the 0-th circle. Although the constraints (33) and (34) involve inﬁnitely many
relations between solutions of the nonlinear discrete map (32), we show that each symmetry is
satisﬁed with only one constraint.

Proposition 3.2. The symmetry (33) on the solutions of the nonlinear discrete map (32) is
satisﬁed if and only if (a0, b0) satisﬁes the following reversibility constraint:

∂xφ0,0(L/2) = ∂xψ(L/2; a0, b0, ǫ) = 0.

(35)

The symmetry (34) is satisﬁed if and only if (c0, d0) satisﬁes the following reversibility condition:

∂xφ0,+(L + π/2) = ∂xψ(π/2; c0, d0, ǫ) = 0.

(36)

Proof. Since the periodic graph Γ is symmetric about the point x = L/2 and the stationary
NLS equation (24) involves only second-order derivatives, the existence and uniqueness theory
for diﬀerential equations implies that the solution φ ∈ D of the stationary NLS equation (24)
is symmetric about the point x = L/2 if and only if it satisﬁes the condition (35). By the
constructions of the solution φ ∈ D with the explicit formula (29), the symmetry (35) translates
uniquely to the symmetry (33) on solutions of the discrete map (32). Thus, solutions of the
two-dimensional discrete map (32) satisfy (33) if and only if (a0, b0) satisfy (35).

The statement for the symmetry (34) and the constraint (36) on (c0, d0) is proved from the

symmetry of the periodic graph Γ about the point x = L + π/2.

Although the discrete map (32) can be used for every solution of the stationary equation (24),
the results are not so explicit. Moreover, many solution branches may coexist for the same values
of ǫ ∈ R. Therefore, we simplify the consideration for small solutions φ ∈ D corresponding to
small values of ǫ ∈ R. This simpliﬁcation is based on the following approximation result.

Lemma 3.3. Consider the initial-value problem (25) with the scaled initial conditions

a = ǫα,

b = ǫ2β

(37)

where α and β are some ǫ-independent real-valued coeﬃcients. For every x0 > 0, there exists
ǫ0 > 0 such that the initial-value problem (25) for every ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0) admits a unique solution
ψ(x) ∈ C∞(0, x0), which is smooth in ǫ and satisﬁes the power series expansion

From smoothness of the nonlinear functions, we have smoothness of the unique global solution
ϕ(x) ∈ C∞(R) in ǫ. Therefore, the unique solution of the initial-value problem (39) satisﬁes the
regular power series expansion given by

ϕ(x; ǫ) = ϕ0(x) + ǫ2ϕ2(x) + ǫ4 ˜ϕǫ(x),

where ϕ′′0(x) = 0, ϕ′′2(x) = (1 − 2ϕ2

Also, by standard Gronwall’s inequality, we obtain that ˜ϕǫ(x) is bounded in L∞(0, x0) for every
x0 > 0 as ǫ → 0. Substituting expressions for ϕ0 and ϕ2 in the power series expansion (40) and
neglecting the OL∞(0,x0)(ǫ4) terms, we obtain (38).

Using scaling (37) and expansion (38), we introduce the scaling transformation for solutions

of the discrete maps (30) and (31):

an = ǫαn,

bn = ǫ2βn,

cn = ǫγn,

dn = ǫ2δn, n ∈ Z.

Next, we construct a suitable approximation for solutions of the discrete map (43). In partic-

ular, we consider a slowly varying solution in the form

αn = A(X),

βn = B(X), X = ǫn, n ∈ Z.

(44)

with smooth A(X), B(X) ∈ C∞(R). Substituting (44) into (43), using Taylor series expansions,
and truncating at the leading-order terms, we obtain

(cid:26) A′(x) = (L + π/2)B(x),
B′(x) = (L + 2π)(1 − 2A2)A,

which is equivalent to the second-order diﬀerential equation

A′′(x) = ν2(1 − 2A2)A,

ν2 := (L + π/2)(L + 2π).

System (45) is satisﬁed with the exact localized solution

A(X) = sech(νX), B(X) = −µ tanh(νX)sech(νX), X ∈ R,

where µ2 := L+2π
reversible solutions of the discrete map (43), we need the following result.

Proposition 3.4. For a given f ∈ ℓ2(Z) satisfying the reversibility symmetry fn = f1−n for every
n ∈ Z, consider solutions of the linearized diﬀerence equation

−

αn+1 − 2αn + αn−1

ǫ2

+ ν2(1 − 6A2(ǫn))αn = fn, n ∈ Z.

(48)

For suﬃciently small ǫ > 0, there exists a unique solution α ∈ ℓ2(Z) satisfying the reversibility
symmetry αn = α1−n for every n ∈ Z. Moreover there is a positive ǫ-independent constant C such
that

ǫ−1 kσ+α − αkℓ2 ≤ Ckf kℓ2,

kαkℓ2 ≤ Ckf kℓ2,

(49)

where σ+ is the shift operator deﬁned by (σ+α)n := αn+1, n ∈ Z.

Proof. As ǫ → 0, the ﬁnite diﬀerence operator in the linearized diﬀerence equation (48) converges
to the Schr¨odinger operator

L∞ := −∂2

X + ν2(1 − 6A2(X)),

(50)

where X is now deﬁned on the real line. The Schr¨odinger operator (50) provides a linearization
of the second-order diﬀerential equation (46). The spectrum of L∞ consists of the continuous
spectrum σc(L∞) ∈ [ν2, ∞) and two isolated eigenvalues, one of which is negative and the other
one is at zero. The zero eigenvalue is related to the translational symmetry and corresponds to
the eigenfunction of L∞ given by A′(X). By continuity of eigenvalues, the homogeneous linearized
diﬀerence equation (48) admits an eigenvalue near zero with the approximate eigenvector A′(ǫn).
Let us now impose the reversibility constraint α0 = α1 on solutions of the linearized diﬀerence
equation (48). If f ∈ ℓ2(Z) satisﬁes the reversibility symmetry fn = f1−n for every n ∈ Z, then the
constraint α0 = α1 deﬁnes uniquely solutions of the linearized diﬀerence equation (48) satisfying
the reversibility symmetry αn = α1−n for every n ∈ Z.

Since A′(−X) = −A(X), for every X ∈ R, the Schr¨odinger operator L∞ is invertible under the
reversibility constraint α0 = α1, and so is the linearized diﬀerence operator for suﬃciently small
values of ǫ. Hence, we obtain the unique reversible solution α ∈ ℓ2(Z) to the linearized diﬀerence
equation (48) satisfying the second bound in (49).

The ﬁrst bound is found from the quadratic form associated with the linearized diﬀerence

equation (48), that is, with

ǫ−2 kσ+α − αk2

ℓ2 = hα, f iℓ2 + ν2h(6A2(ǫ·) − 1)α, αiℓ2 .

Using Cauchy–Schwartz inequality and the second bound in (49), we obtain the ﬁrst bound in
(49).

With the help of Proposition 3.4, we prove the persistence of the approximation (44) and (47)

among the reversible solutions of the discrete map (43).

Lemma 3.5. Consider solutions of the discrete map (43) in the perturbed form

αn = A(ǫn + X0) + ˜αn,

βn = B(ǫn + X0) + ˜βn, n ∈ Z,

(51)

where X0 is a parameter. There exists ǫ0 > 0 and C0 > 0 such that for every ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0), there
exist a unique choice for X0 and (˜α, ˜β) ∈ ℓ2(Z) satisfying

|X0| + k˜αkℓ2 + k ˜βkℓ2 ≤ C0ǫ,

(52)

13

such that (α, β) ∈ ℓ2(Z) solve the discrete map (43) subject to the following reversibility constraint
on (α0, β0):

∂xψ(L/2; ǫα0, ǫ2β0, ǫ) = 0.

(53)

Proof. First, we rewrite the two-dimensional discrete map (43) as the scalar second-order diﬀerence
equation. This equivalent formulation is convenient for persistence analysis near the approximated
solution (47). Expressing

The remainder term R is a smooth function of (αn+1αn, αn−1) and ǫ, which remains bounded by
an ǫ-independent constant as ǫ → 0 if kαkℓ2 is bounded by an ǫ-independent constant.

Next, we ensure that the parameter X0 can be uniquely chosen to satisfy the reversibility
symmetry (33). By Proposition 3.2, the symmetry (33) is satisﬁed if and only if the parameters
(a0, b0) satisﬁes the constraint (35). By virtue of the scaling (41), the reversibility constraint is
written in the form (53). By Lemma 3.3, we rewrite the constraint (53) in the perturbed form

Using (54), we rewrite this constraint in the form

α1 − α0 =

(1 − 2α2

0)α0 + ǫ4G(α0, ǫ),

(56)

(57)

where G is a smooth function of α0 and ǫ, which remains bounded by an ǫ-independent constant
as ǫ → 0 if α0 is bounded by an ǫ-independent constant.

Substituting the decomposition (51) into the constraint (57), we obtain

˜α1 − ˜α0 + A(X0 + ǫ) − A(X0) =

(1 − 2(A(X0) + ˜α0)2)(A(X0) + ˜α0)

π(L + 2π)ǫ2

+ ǫ4G(A(X0) + ˜α0, ǫ).

(58)

14

For uniqueness of the decomposition (51), we supply the constraint

˜α1 = ˜α0.

(59)

Since A′(0) = 0 and A′′(0) 6= 0, we can apply the implicit function theorem to solve the implicit
equation (58) for X0 in terms of ˜α0 for ǫ > 0 suﬃciently small. The value of X0 = O(ǫ) is uniquely
determined from the implicit equation for every ˜α ∈ ℓ2(Z) satisfying a priori bound

k˜αkℓ2 ≤ C,

(60)

where C > 0 is ǫ-independent.

Next, we proceed with the perturbed solution of the discrete map (55). Substituting the
decomposition (51) and using the diﬀerential equation (46), we rewrite the second-order diﬀerence
equation in the equivalent form

and

Hn(ǫ) :=

A(ǫn + ǫ + X0) − 2A(ǫn + X0) + A(ǫn − ǫ + X0)

ǫ2

− A′′(ǫn + X0).

Since A(X) ∈ C∞(R) and X0 = O(ǫ), the terms H(ǫ) and G(ǫ) satisfy the estimates

Gn(ǫ) := A2(ǫn + X0) − A2(ǫn).

kH(ǫ)kℓ2 ≤ Cǫ2,

kG(ǫ)kℓ2 ≤ Cǫ,

(62)

where the positive constant C is ǫ-independent for every ǫ > 0 suﬃciently small.

On the other hand, both functions F (αn+1, αn, αn−1) and R(αn+1, αn, αn−1, ǫ) in (61) are C∞

in terms of (αn+1, αn, αn−1) and ǫ. It follows from the explicit expression for F that

kF (A(ǫ · +ǫ + X0), A(ǫ · +X0), A(ǫ · −ǫ + X0))kℓ2 ≤ Cǫ,

(63)

where C > 0 is ǫ-independent. Therefore, the inhomogeneous terms of the perturbed system (61)
is bounded in a ball in ℓ2(Z) of the size O(ǫ). Since ǫ > 0 is suﬃciently small, vectors in this ball
satisfy the a priori assumption (60) used earlier.

Invoking the bounds (49) of Proposition 3.4, we can use the ﬁxed point iterations for solutions

of the persistence problem (61) satisfying the bounds

ǫ−1 kσ+ ˜α − ˜αkℓ2 ≤ Cǫ,

k˜αkℓ2 ≤ Cǫ,

(64)

where C > 0 is ǫ-independent. Linearization of F (αn+1, αn, αn−1) at αn = A(ǫn + X0) yields
O(ǫ) perturbations to the linearized diﬀerence operator in the left-hand side of (61) acting on
ǫ−1(σ+ ˜α − ˜α) and ˜α in ℓ2(Z).

We are now in position to invert the linearized diﬀerence operator in the left-hand-side of (61)
and to apply the ﬁxed-point iterations for solutions of the persistence problem (61) satisfying

15

the estimates (64). Indeed, the solution ˜α is supposed to satisfy the reversibility constraint (59),
whereas the right-hand side satisﬁes the reversibility condition used in Proposition 3.4, thanks to
our choice of parameter X0 from (58). Equations (58) and (59) together deﬁne uniquely X0 and
satisfy the reversibility constraint (53).

By Proposition 3.4, the linearized diﬀerence operator in the left-hand-side of (61) is invertible
with the bound (49) for suﬃciently small ǫ > 0, so that the ﬁxed-point iterations work in a ball in
ℓ2(Z) of the size O(ǫ). By the implicit function theorem, thanks to the estimates (62) and (63),
we obtain a unique solution ˜α ∈ ℓ2(Z) to the perturbed system (61) satisfying the reversibility
constraint (59) and the bounds (64). Combining this result with the unique choice for X0 = O(ǫ)
from (58) and β ∈ ℓ2(Z) from (54), we obtain bound (52). The statement of the lemma is
proved.

Remark 3.6. Lemma 3.5 can be extended to solutions of the discrete map (43) satisfying the
reversibility symmetry (34). In this case, using the scaling (41), we rewrite the reversibility con-
straint (36) in the form:

∂xψ(π/2; ǫγ0, ǫ2δ0, ǫ) = 0.

(65)

After the straightforward computations involving system (42), the constraint (65) can be expressed
for the variables (α0, β0) in the perturbed form:

β0 = −ǫ(L + π)(1 − 2α2

0)α0 + O(ǫ3),

(66)

which is not so diﬀerent from (56). As a result, the value of X0 is chosen diﬀerently from the
constraint (66), yet, the construction for X0 and (˜α, ˜β) ∈ ℓ2(Z) is unique.

Remark 3.7. Using the representation (29), Proposition 3.2, and Lemma 3.3, the results of
Lemma 3.5 and Remark 3.6 imply the statement of Theorem 1.1 with bound (6) and symmetries
(7) and (8) on the bound states φ of the stationary NLS equation (3) with Λ = −ǫ2. Property
(i) holds by the construction. However, properties (ii) and (iii) have not yet been proved.
In
particular, we cannot state positivity and exponential decay of the sequence {αn, βn}n∈Z, which
makes it impossible to claim the same properties for the bound state φ.

Remark 3.8. The result of Lemma 3.5 corresponds to the reductions of the NLS equation (1) on
the periodic graph Γ to the cubic NLS equation (2) established in [11]. Equation (46) corresponds to
the stationary NLS equation obtained from the cubic NLS equation (2) with β = ν−2 and γ = 2 for
the steady solutions in the form Ψ(X, T ) = A(X)e−iT . Indeed, justiﬁcation of stationary versions
of the NLS equation follows closely to the justiﬁcation of the time-dependent equations and relies
on the generalized Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction method [21]. Bloch wave functions are used for
derivation and justiﬁcation of these equations, whereas the coeﬃcient β = ν−2 corresponds to the
asymptotic computation (23) obtained from the linear analysis of the lowest spectral band σ1 of
σ(−∂2

x) in D ⊂ L2(Γ).

4 Properties of the bound states bifurcating on Γ

We ﬁrst claim positivity and exponential decay of the sequence {αn, βn}n∈Z in the reversible
solutions of the two-dimensional discrete map (43). To do so, we use the theory of invariant
manifolds for discrete maps. Applications of this theory to construct two distinct sets of so-called
on-site and inter-site homoclinic orbits in the discrete NLS equation can be found in [24]. A

16

diﬀerent but spiritually similar technique for approximations of homoclinic orbits in discrete maps
via normal forms is described in [14].

We rewrite the two-dimensional discrete map (43) in the abstract form

(cid:26) αn+1 = αn + fǫ(αn, βn),

βn+1 = βn + gǫ(αn, βn),

(67)

where (fǫ, gǫ) are smooth functions of (αn, βn) and ǫ, which are available in the form of the
perturbative expansion:

(cid:26) fǫ(αn, βn) := ǫ(L + π/2)βn + 1

gǫ(αn, βn) := ǫ(L + 2π)(1 − 2α2

n)βn + O(ǫ3).

(68)

2 ǫ2(L2 + πL + π2)(1 − 2α2
n)αn + 1

4 ǫ2(2L2 + 4Lπ + π2)(1 − 6α2

n)αn + O(ǫ3),

We shall prove existence of homoclinic reversible orbits in the discrete map (67) for small ǫ 6= 0,
which have the required properties of positivity and exponential decay.

Lemma 4.1. There exist ǫ0 > 0 and C0 > 0 such that for every ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0), there exists two
distinct homoclinic orbits to the discrete map (67) such that (α0, β0) satisfy either constraint (53)
or (65). Moreover, for each homoclinic orbit, we have

kαkℓ2 + kβkℓ2 ≤ C0

(69)

and

(a) αn > 0 for every n ∈ Z,

(b) αn → 0 as |n| → ∞ exponentially fast,

(c) there is N > 0 such that {αn}n∈Z is monotonically increasing for n < −N and decreasing

for n > N .

The sequence {(αn, βn)}n∈Z for the two homoclinic orbits is smooth in ǫ.
Proof. The point (0, 0) is a ﬁxed point of the discrete map (67) because fǫ(0, 0) = gǫ(0, 0) = 0
follows by existence and uniqueness of zero solutions of the initial-value problems (27) and (28),
see Proposition 3.1. The Jacobian matrix of the discrete map (67) at (0, 0) is given by

A = (cid:20)

1 + O(ǫ2)

ǫ(L + π/2) + O(ǫ3)

ǫ(L + 2π) + O(ǫ3)

1 + O(ǫ2)

(cid:21) .

(70)

The two eigenvalues of A are λ± = 1 ± ǫν + O(ǫ2), where ν2 := (L + π/2)(L + 2π), therefore,
the ﬁxed point is hyperbolic for every ǫ 6= 0. If there exists a homoclinic orbit {αn, βn}n∈Z to the
hyperbolic ﬁxed point (0, 0), then |αn| + |βn| → 0 as |n| → ∞ exponentially fast, by the stable
and unstable curve theory for hyperbolic ﬁxed points.

Therefore, we only need to prove existence of the two distinct positive homoclinic orbits to
the discrete map (67), which corresponds to the two reversibility constraints (53) and (65), see
Proposition 3.2. Without loss of generality, we consider the symmetry constraint (53) given by
the asymptotic expansion (56). The symmetry constraint represents a curve in the (α, β) plane
given asymptotically by

β = Nǫ(α) := −

ǫL
2

(1 − 2α2)α + O(ǫ3) as

ǫ → 0.

(71)

17

By the symmetry, it is suﬃcient to construct the one-dimensional unstable curve for the discrete
map (67) and to prove that this curve intersects the curve (71). By discrete group of translations
and continuous dependence on the initial conditions, the intersection point can be translated to
the location n = 0 in the sequence {αn, βn}n∈Z and hence satisfy the symmetry constraint (53).
For the unstable eigenvalue λ+ = 1 + ǫν + O(ǫ2), the corresponding eigenvector of A deﬁnes a

straight line on the (α, β) plane,

β = [µ + O(ǫ)] α,

as

ǫ → 0,

(72)

where µ2 := L+2π
L+π/2 . The straight line (72) is located in the ﬁrst quadrant of positive α and β.
By the invariant curve theory, there exists a one-dimensional unstable curve β = Uǫ(α) in the
(α, β) plane, which is tangent to the line deﬁned by (72). Therefore, there exists N1 ∈ Z such that
{αn, βn}n=N1

n=−∞ are monotonically increasing and αn, βn > 0 for every n ≤ N1.

Figure 4 shows the plane (α, β) together with the symmetry curve (71) (red dash-dotted line)
and the unstable curve (72) (green dashed line). The blue dots show the monotonically increasing
sequence {αn, βn}n=N1

n=−∞ according to the approximate solution (47).

By the explicit form of fǫ in (68), there is a positive ǫ-independent constant C1 such that
fǫ(αn, βn) > 0 for ǫ > 0 suﬃciently small, as long as β ≥ C1ǫα. Therefore, the sequence {αn}
remains monotonically increasing as long as β ≥ C1ǫα.

By the explicit form of gǫ in (68), there is a positive ǫ-independent constant C2 such that the

sequence {βn} is monotonically decreasing if α > 1√2

− C2ǫβ.

Since

λn
+ = (1 + ǫν + O(ǫ2))n = enǫν(1+O(ǫ)),

(73)
it follows from (72) and (73) that if αN1 > 1√2
− C2ǫβN1, then N1 = O(ǫ−1) and βN1 = O(1) as
ǫ → 0. From the explicit forms of fǫ and gǫ discussed above, it follows that there exists N2 > N1
such that {αn}n=N2
n=N1 is monotonically decreasing until
it reaches βN2 ≤ C1ǫαN2.

n=−∞ is monotonically increasing and {βn}n=N2

ǫ → 0,

as

Since the values of βn decrease from O(1) at n = N1 to O(ǫ) at n = N2, we have N2 − N1 =
. If βN2 ≤ Nǫ(αN2), we are done. If βN2 > Nǫ(αN2), then
− C2ǫβN2 and βN2 ≤ C1ǫαN2, there is an ǫ-
becomes monotonically decreasing, whereas
continues to be monotonically decreasing until it reaches βN2+K ≤ Nǫ(αN2+K) for

O(ǫ−1) and αN2 ≥ C3 for some C3 > 1√2
we continue iterations further. Since αN2 ≥ C3 > 1√2
independent positive integer K such that {αn}n=N2+K
{βn}n=N2+K
αN2+K ≥ C4 for some C4 ∈ (cid:16) 1√2

, C3(cid:17). See Figure 4.
In either case, the sequence {(αn, βn)}n=N2+K

n=−∞ crosses the curve β = Nǫ(α) in the (α, β) plane.
The statement of the proposition is proved by the discrete translational invariance, the reversibility
symmetry, and the continuous dependence of sequences from initial data.

A similar construction holds for the symmetry constraint (65), which is given by the asymptotic
expansion (66). Smoothness in ǫ is obtained by smoothness of the vector ﬁeld and all asymptotic
expansions in ǫ.

Remark 4.2. If K > 0 in the proof of Lemma 4.1, the sequence {αn}n∈Z constructed for two
distinct homoclinic orbits in Lemma 4.1 is not monotonically increasing for n < 0 and decreasing
for n > 0. Indeed, at the symmetry curve (71), we have

Figure 4: The plane (α, β) for L = π/2 and ǫ = 0.02, where the blue dots denote a sequence
{αn, βn}n∈Z given approximately by the solution (47), the green dashed line shows the unstable
curve β = Uǫ(α), and the red dash-dotted line shows the symmetry curve β = Nǫ(α).

therefore, fǫ(α, Nǫ(α)) < 0 for α > 1√2
, if ǫ is suﬃciently small. Thus, the sequence {αn}n∈Z
is only proved to be monotonically increasing for n < −N and decreasing for n > N , where the
number N ≥ 0 is ǫ-independent for suﬃciently small ǫ.

Remark 4.3. Since we are not able to prove that α0 = 1 + O(ǫ) for the two distinct homoclinic
orbits constructed in Lemma 4.1, we are not able to claim immediately that these homoclinic orbits
are the same as the ones in Lemma 3.5. Nevertheless, because of convergence of ﬁnite diﬀerences
to derivatives in the two-dimensional discrete map (67) as ǫ → 0 and smoothness of the sequences
{(αn, βn)}n∈Z with respect to ǫ in Lemma 4.1, the two distinct homoclinic orbits converge as ǫ → 0
to the leading-order approximation (47), which is uniquely continued in Lemma 3.5. Therefore, in
the end, we claim that these two distinct solutions of Lemmas 3.5 and 4.1 are the same.

We shall now transfer properties of Lemma 4.1 to the bound states of the stationary NLS

equation (24) for small ǫ 6= 0.

Corollary 4.4. There exist ǫ0 > 0 and C0 > 0 such that for every ǫ ∈ (0, ǫ0), there exists two
distinct bound states φ ∈ D ⊂ L2(Γ) to the stationary NLS equation (24) satisfying the constraints
(7) and (8). Moreover, for each branch, we have

kφkH 2(Γ) ≤ C0ǫ

(74)

and

(i) φn,+(x) = φn,−(x) for every x ∈ [nP + L, (n + 1)P ],
(ii) φ(x) > 0 for every x ∈ Γ,

(iii) φ(x) → 0 as |x| → ∞ exponentially fast.

The function φ for the two bound states is smooth in ǫ.

Proof. The result follows from Lemma 4.1, with the representation (29) and the asymptotic ex-
pansions of Lemma 3.3. These asymptotic expansions can be rewritten explicitly as follows:

φn,0(x) = ǫ(cid:20)αn + ǫβn(x − nP ) +

ǫ2αn(1 − 2α2

n)(x − nP )2 + OL∞(nP,nP +L)(ǫ3)(cid:21)

and

φn,+(x) = ǫ(cid:20)γn + ǫδn(x − nP − L) +
where {(αn, βn)}n∈Z is deﬁned at one of the two homoclinic orbits of Lemma 4.1, whereas {(γn, δn)}n∈Z
are found from system (42).

Bound (74) follows from this asymptotic representation and bound (69). Symmetry (i) follows
by the construction of the reduction (12). Positivity (ii) and exponential decay (iii) follows from
properties (a) and (b) of Lemma 4.1 provided the rate of exponential decay of sequences {αn}n∈Z
and {βn}n∈Z coincides. The latter fact follows from the invariant curve theory for two-dimensional
discrete maps. Smoothness of φ in ǫ follows from smoothness of the sequence {(αn, βn)}n∈Z in ǫ,
as stated in Lemma 4.1.

Remark 4.5. Theorem 1.1 is a reformulation of the result of Corollary 4.4.

Figure 6: The same as Figure 5 but for the bound state with symmetry (8).

In order to illustrate the construction of two distinct bound states in Corollary 4.4, we compute
numerical approximations of bounded localized solutions of the stationary NLS equation (24) on
the periodic graph Γ. The numerical method uses the ﬁrst-order invariant (26) piecewise on the
segments Γn,0 and Γn,+ of the periodic graph Γ. The starting point (φ, φ′) = (φ0, 0) at the center
of symmetry (either x0 = L/2 or x0 = L + π/2) is used as parameter of the shooting method. The
boundary conditions (13) and (14) are preserved at each breaking point of the graph in order to

20

recompute the value of the ﬁrst-order invariant (26) and to continue the solution away from the
points of symmetry. The parameter φ0 of the shooting method is adjusted to obtain a homoclinic
orbit on the periodic graph Γ. The two distinct families of the bound states are shown on Figures
5 and 6 both on the plane (x, φ) and on the phase plane (φ, φ′). The green dotted line shows the
solitary wave of the stationary NLS equation on the inﬁnite line, which is available analytically as
φ(x) = ǫsech(ǫ(x−x0)) for each of the bound state. Note that although the jumps in the derivative
φ′ look large on the right panels of Figures 5 and 6, the scaling is O(10−3) for the vertical axis.

We end this work with remarks on energy estimates, which are useless to distinguish which of
the two bound states of Corollary 4.4 serves a ground state. By deﬁnition, the ground state is a
bound state of minimal energy E given by (4) under ﬁxed mass Q given by (5). Equivalently, the
ground state is a solution φ ∈ D ⊂ L2(Γ) to the stationary NLS equation (24) for ﬁxed ǫ > 0 that
corresponds to the smallest value of mass Q.

Substituting the asymptotic representation of Corollary 4.4 to the expression (5) and using
smoothness of all quantities in ǫ, we obtain the asymptotic representation for each homoclinic
orbit:

Q = ǫ2Xn∈Z

n) + ǫ3Xn∈Z

(Lα2

n + 2πγ2

(L2αnβn + 2π2γnδn) + O(ǫ4).

(75)

Symmetry (33) of the ﬁrst homoclinic orbit implies

which reduces the asymptotic expression (75) for Q to the form

α−n = γn,

β−n = −2δn, n ∈ Z,

Q = (L + 2π)ǫ2Xn∈Z

α2

n + (L2 − π2)ǫ3Xn∈Z

αnβn + O(ǫ4).

(76)

On the other hand, symmetry (34) of the second homoclinic orbit implies

α−n = γn+1,

β−n = −2δn+1, n ∈ Z,

which results in the same expression (76) for Q. Since {(αn, βn)}n∈Z approaches the same approx-
imation (47) as ǫ → 0, the value of Q is identical in the ﬁrst two orders of ǫ. In fact, we suspect
that this value is only diﬀerent by a term that is exponentially small in ǫ. As a result, we are not
able to claim which bound state is a ground state by using power expansions in ǫ.

As is formulated in Remarks 1.2 and 1.3, we anticipate that the bound state satisfying the
symmetry (7) is a ground state of the periodic metric graph. We also anticipate that both bound
states are extended to all values of ǫ, that is, to the limit Λ → −∞ within the stationary NLS
equation (3). Indeed, using the same numerical method, we have conﬁrmed that both bound states
exists in the stationary NLS equation (3) with Λ = −10. Figure 7 illustrates the proﬁles of the
two bound states for Λ = −10. In this case, the bound states become more concentrated at the
nearest cells to the symmetry centers of the periodic graph Γ.
