We study a 1D transport equation with nonlocal velocity with subcritical or supercritical
dissipation. For all data in the weighted Sobolev space H k(wλ,κ)∩L∞, with k = max(0, 3/2−α)
and wλ,κ is a given family of Muckenhoupt weights. We prove a global existence result in
the subcritical case α ∈ (1, 2). We also prove a local existence theorem for large data in
H 2(wλ,κ) ∩ L∞ in the supercritical case α ∈ (0, 1). The proofs are based on the use of the
weighted Littlewood-Paley theory, interpolation along with some new commutator estimates.

Introduction

In this paper, we are interested in the following 1D transport equation with nonlocal velocity

which was introduced by C´ordoba, C´ordoba and Fontelos in [14] :

This equation is related to a simple scalar model introduced by Constantin, Lax and Majda (see
[10]) in order to get a better understanding of the 3D Euler equation written in terms of the
vorticity w (that is the curl of the velocity, and the velocity is determined by vx = Hw), namely
the following 1D equation

∂tω = ωHω.

In [10], the authors proved that most of the solutions blow-up in ﬁnite time. More recently
Okamoto, Sakajo and Wunsch [29] introduced a generalization of the Constantin, Lax, Majda
(CLM) and the De Gregorio’s model, namely

∂tw + avwx − wHw = 0.

The case a = −1, a = 0, a = 1 being respectively the C´ordoba, C´ordoba and Fontelos model (blow-
up of regular solutions can occure as shown in [14], [26], and [31]), the CLM model (most solutions
blow-up in ﬁnite time) and the De Gregorio’s model (it is conjecured that solutions exist globally in
time and numerical evidence presented in [29] are in line with the conjecture). This nonlocal trans-
port equation can also be seen as a 1D model of the dissipative surface quasi geostrophic equation
introduced in [9] written in a divergence form. It is therefore closely related to the incompressible
3D Euler equation written in terms of vorticity (see [9]). Another motivation is the link between
this equation and the Birkoﬀ-Rott equation which modelises the evolution of vortex sheets with

1

surface tension (see e.g.[14]). As usually, one has to consider three cases depending on the value of
α ∈ (0, 2), namely the cases α < 1, α = 1, α > 1 which are respectively called supercritical, critical
and subcritical cases. In the inviscid case (η = 0), C´ordoba C´ordoba and Fontelos have shown in
[14] that there exists a class of smooth initial data for which the solutions blow-up in ﬁnite time.
This result has been extended to a slightly dissipative case by Li and Rodrigo [26] who proved
the existence of a class of smooth data such that the solutions blow-up in ﬁnite time when the
dissipation rate is in the range α ∈ (0, 1/2). These results have been proved in four diﬀerents way
by Silvestre and Vicol [31] for α ∈ [0, 1/2) for equation (Tα). It is still an open problem to know
whether regular solutions blow-up or exist globally in time in the case 1/2 ≤ α < 1. The eventual
regularty of smooth solution in the spirit of previous works for the supercritical SQG equation, has
been obtained by Do in [16]. We also note that the local well posedness in H 2 has been obtained
by Bae and Granero-Belinch´on in [1] in the inviscd case. Both the subcritical and critical case
are now quite well understood, for instance, estimate are etablished in [17] for data in H 3/2−α in
the critical case using Littlewood-Paley theory. Moreover, by adaptading for instance the method
of Constantin and Vicol introduced in [11] or the approach of Kiselev, Nazarov and Volberg [22]
one obtain the existence of global smooth solutions in the critical case. Roughly speaking, most
of the results known in the critical and subcritical case for the surface quasi-geostrophic equation
turn out to work for this 1D model. However, it seems that constructing global L2 solutions in the
supercritical or critical case is still not known. Indeed, one can easily derive a nice energy estimate
(see [14]) but the lack of compactness prevents one from passing to the weak limit in the nonlin-
earity and therefore the existence remains an open problem (we refer to [11] or [24] for more details).
In this article, we study equation (Tα) with subcritical or supercritical diﬀusion. We extended
the class of initial data of some recent existence results (essentially some of those in [17], and [1])
to the weighted setting. By considering data in weighted Lebesgue or Sobolev spaces with a weight
which has the property to be suﬃcently decaying at inﬁnity say like |x|−λ, with λ > 0, one is allowed
to consider the problem (Tα) with an initial data that behaves for instance like θ0(x) ∼ |x|−1/2 at
inﬁnity, and therefore does not necessarily belong to L2. In order to avoid integrability problems
close to the origin one may consider a weight of the form wλ(x) = (1 + |x|)−λ. Then, since (Tα)
involves the Hilbert transform, it could be interesting to choose wλ so that the Hilbert transform
is a continuous in weighted Lebesgue spaces Lp(wλ), this is equivalent to choose the weight in the
Muckenkoupt class Ap (see 3.2 for the deﬁnition). Such a weight has not to be integrable far from
the origin by deﬁnition (it has to obey a reverse H¨older inequality), hence one has to choose λ < 1.
Therefore, a possible family of weights that one could consider is for instance the one deﬁned by
wλ(x) = (1 + |x|)−λ with λ ∈ (0, 1). Such kind of weights have been already considered by Farwig
and Sohr in [19] (with κ = 1) in the study of the Stokes problem. More recently in a work by
Lemari´e-Rieusset and the author in [24] where the critical case for equation Tα where studied with
the same kind of weight in the special case κ = 2). As a matter of fact, if one would need to control
say κ > 1 derivatives of the weight, then it would be better to use a more general class of radially
symmetric weights of the type wλ,κ(x) = (1 + |x|κ)λ/κ with λ ∈ (0, 1) which are still Mukenhoupt
weights. In this article, we would need to control at least two derivatives of the weight thus we shall
assume the integer κ ≥ 2 to be even (in oder to avoid diﬀerentiability issues). We shall therefore
consider the general family of Muckenhoupt’s weight given by wλ,κ(x) = (1 +|x|κ)−λ/κ. Note that
the weight considered in [19] and [24] correspond respectively to the cases κ = 1 and κ = 2.

When one try to do energy estimates in such kind of weighted spaces some diﬃculties appear.
One of the main issue is to control some extra commutators that involve the fractional diﬀerential
operator (−∆)α and the weight wλ,κ. Another obstacle is that the usual Sobolev embedding from
H k into L∞, k > n/2 is not any more true in the weighted setting that is why, it must be important
to always specify that the data lie in L∞ even if the data is in a suﬃciently regular weighted Sobolev
space. However, one may still use weighted Sobolev’s embedding with intermediate exponents
(diﬀerent from 1 and ∞), this is done for instance by Fabes, Kenig and Serapioni in [18] or in
Maz’ya’s book [27].

We shall prove a global existence result for data in the weighted Sobolev spaces H k

w with
k = max(0, 3/2 − α) for subcritical values of α as well as a local existence theorem for data in H 2
w
in the supercritical case.

A key tool in the proof of those existence results is the use of some new commutator estimates
involving the familly of weights wλ and the nonlocal operator (−∆)α/2 (in particular for supercriti-
cal values of α). These lemma can be used to treat other equations that involve nonlocal fractional
operators. Another tool is the Littlewood-Paley theory in the weighted setting which allows to
deal with data in Sobolev space. It is worth saying that in the case H 1 or H 1/2 on could follow the
approach of [24] in the subcritical case taking advantage of nice cancellations and formulas involv-
ing the Hilbert transform. However, in this paper we aim at stating a theorem that allow to deal
with a bigger range of Sobolev regularity. The use of the weighted Littlewood-Paley theory turned
out to be eﬃcient to treat the low frequencies of the Hilbert transform which are not continuous
in L∞. Also, new commutator estimates are needed to treat the supercritical or subcritical case.

The article is organized as follows. In the ﬁrst section, we give the statement of the main theorems.
In the third section, we recall some tools and important results that we shall use in the proof of
our main theorems.
In the third part, we establish a priori estimates for positive initial data
θ0 ∈ H k(wλ,κ(x)dx) ∩ L∞ with k = max(0, 3/2 − α) where the case k = 0 and k (cid:54)= 0 are treated
separetly into two subsections. The last section is devoted to the proof of the local existence for
H 2

w data in the supercritical case.

2 Main results

In the subcritical case, we have the following global existence result for arbitrary large data in
weighted Sobolev spaces.
Theorem 2.1. Assume that 1 < α < 2, then for all weights wλ,κ(x) = (1 + |x|κ)−λ/κ with
λ ∈ (0, 1) and κ ≥ 2 an even integer, and for all positive initial data θ0 ∈ H k(wλ,κ(x)dx) ∩ L∞
with k ∈ max(0, 3/2 − α), there exists at least one global solution θ to the equation Tα, which
veriﬁes, for all ﬁnite T > 0

θ ∈ C([0, T ], H k(wλ,κ(x)dx)) ∩ L2([0, T ], ˙H k+α/2(wλ,κ(x)dx)).

Moreover, for all T < ∞, we have

(cid:107)θ(T )(cid:107)2

H k(wλ,κ) ≤ (cid:107)θ0(cid:107)2

H k(wλ,κ)eCT

The constant C > 0 depends on (cid:107)θ0(cid:107)L∞ , λ, κ and ν.

In the supercritical case, we obtain a local existence result of solutions for arbitrary H 2

w data.

Theorem 2.2. Assume that 0 < α < 1, then for all data θ0 ∈ H 2
where the weight is given
by wλ(x) = (1 + |x|κ)−λ/κ with λ ∈ (0, α/2). Then, there exists a time T ∗(θ0) > 0 such that (Tα)
admits at least one solution that veriﬁes

wλ,κ

θ ∈ C([0, T ], H 2(wλ,κ(x)dx)) ∩ L2([0, T ], ˙H 2+ α

2 (wλ,κ(x)dx))

for all T ≤ T ∗.

Remark 2.3. In the proof of Theorem 2.1, we shall treat the case k = 0 separetly, for the other
values of k the proof is based on the use of the weighted Littlewood-Paley decomposition where a
careful treatment of the low frequencies of the velocity is needed.

Remark 2.4. Beside extending some previous results from [17] and [1] this article contains also
some new commutator estimates that could be of interest in the study of more general nonlocal
and nonlinear equations involving the operator Λα that are contained in lemma 4.1.

We shall also use the classical Hardy-Littlewood maximal function deﬁned as follows. The Hardy-
Littlewood maximal function of a locally integrable function θ on Rn is deﬁned by

where the supremum is taken over all cubes Q of Rn centered at the point x ∈ Rn and |Q| stands
for the Lebesgue measure of the cube Q. One of the remarkable properties of the maximal Hardy-
Littlewood function is that it is continuous operator from Lp to Lp for all 1 < p ≤ ∞. For p = 1,
it is a continuous operator from L1 to the weak Lebesgue space L1,∞ endowed with the norm
(cid:107)θ(cid:107)L1,∞ = supλ>0
The extension of this very useful continuity property to weighted Lebesgue spaces goes back to
Muckenhoupt [28]. He proved that a necessary and suﬃcient condition on w which ensured the
continuity of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function on Lp(w), 1 < p ≤ ∞. More precisely, the
Muckenhoupt theorem [28] states that there exists a constant C1 > 0 such that

(cid:8)λ−1|{x ∈ Rn,|θ(x)| > λ}|(cid:9).

(cid:90)

The necessary condition is not diﬃcult to obtain, it suﬃces to set θ(x) = w(x)
for the suﬃcient condition we refer to [28] or [8].

Another remarkable property of the Ap weights is that the Hilbert transform is a continuous
operator on the space Lp(w), with 1 < p < ∞ if and only if the weight w belongs the Ap class
of Muckenhoupt that is those which verify 3.2 (see [20]). More generally, this property holds for
all Calder´on-Zygmund operators T (see for instance [13], [8], [32]), namely, there exists a constant
C(T, w) > 0 which depends on the operator T and on the weight w, such that

(cid:107)T (f )(cid:107)Lp(w) ≤ C(T, w)(cid:107)w(cid:107)Ap(cid:107)f(cid:107)Lp(w).

As mentioned in the introduction, the familly of weights wλ,κ(x) = (1 + |x|κ)−λ/κ with 0 < λ < 1
and κ ≥ 2 being an even integer, that we consider in the article belongs to the (Ap)p∈[2,∞) class of
Muckenhoupt. Therefore, one can use the aforementioned useful continuity results.

We ﬁnish this section by recalling that, as in the unweighted setting (see for instance [25],
[4], [2]), the weighted Sobolev H s
w spaces can be deﬁned through Littlewood-Paley theory when
w ∈ A∞ = ∩p>1Ap (see [23]). Even in the case w ∈ Ap,loc (that is considering only small cubes in
the supremum in 3.2) one still have a satisfactory Littlewood-Paley theory as shown in [30]. The
construction is as follows, ﬁx a function φ ∈ D(Rn) that is non-negative and radial and such that
φ0(ξ) = 1, if |ξ| ≤ 1/2 and φ0(ξ) = 0 if |ξ| ≥ 1. Then, from this ﬁxed function φ0 we construct
a familly of functions ψ0 so that ψ0(ξ) = φ0(ξ/2) − φ0(ξ) and for j ∈ Z. Then we deﬁne the
distributions Sjf = F−1(φ0(2−jξ) ˆf (ξ)) and ∆jf = F−1(ψ0(2−jξ) ˆf (ξ)) and we get the so-called
(inhomogeneous) Littlewood-Paley decompositon of f ∈ S(cid:48)(Rn) that is for all K ∈ Z we have the
following inequality in S(cid:48)(Rn)

f = SKf +

∆jf.

(3.3)

The homogeneous decomposition is obtained through a passage to the limit in equality 3.3 as
K → −∞ in the S(cid:48)(Rn) topology and we obtain

(cid:88)

j≥K

(cid:88)

j∈Z

f =

(3.4)

Equality 3.4 is called the homogeneous decomposition and has to be considered modulo polyno-
mials, indeed, ∆jf = 0 ⇔ f is a polynomial. Then, we deﬁne the homogeneous weighted Sobolev
spaces ˙H s

(cid:88)

In order to deal with weighted Lp-estimate of derivatives that involves the operators ∆j or Sj we
shall use the so-called Berstein’s inequality. It says that, for all f ∈ S(cid:48)(Rn) and couple (j, s) ∈ Z×R,
and for all 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ ∞ and all weights w ∈ A∞, we have
(cid:107)Λs∆jf(cid:107)Lp
For two distributions f and g that are in S(cid:48)(Rn), we may write the paraproduct as follows

To establish the existence of at least one solution to equation (Tα) it is sometimes useful to truncate
the initial data using a function ψR that is a smooth, positive and compactly supported function
in B2R = [−2R, 2R]. To construct ψR, we consider a function ψ ∈ [0, 1] such that ψ(x) = 1 if
|x| ≤ 1, and 0 if |x| ≥ 2 and then, for R > 0 we deﬁne

ψR(x) ≡ ψ(x/R).

(3.5)

This truncation function ψR will be used throughout the paper when making energy estimates.
Note that the constants that will appear in the estimations will always depend on harmless quan-
tities, these constants will be sometimes hidden into the symbol (cid:46). Before proving the results, we
need to introduce some important lemmas. This is the aim of the next section.

4 Commutator estimates in the subcritical or supercritical

cases.

In this section, we prove a commutator estimate involving the familly of (Ap)p∈(1,∞) Muck-
enhoupt weights wλ,κ(x) = (1 + |x|κ)−λ/κ, 0 < λ < 1, κ ≥ 2 being an even integer. More
precisely, in our a priori estimates we shall need to control some extra commutators of the type
Twλ,κ(f ) ≡ [Λα/2, wλ,κ]f . We shall need to use that such a commutator is continuous operator
from L2(w) to L2(w−1
λ,κ) in both the subcritical and supercritical cases. In the supercritical case,
we need λ to be smaller than α/2 whereas in the subcritical case we allow λ ∈ (0, 1). We shall also
need another lemma that gives an L∞ bound for the singular operator Λαwλ,κ with α ∈ (0, 2). We
shall prove both lemmas in Rn. The constant C(n, α, λ, κ) > 0 that will appear throughout this
section can be diﬀerent from a line to another but we shall keep the same notation for the sake of
simplicity.
Lemma 4.1. Let us consider the family of weights given by wλ,κ(x) = (1 + |x|κ)−λ/κ, then have
the following two estimates :

• If α ∈ (0, 1), then for all λ such that 0 < λ < α/2 and for all even integer κ ≥ 2, the operator

Twλ,κ : L2(wλ,κ) −→ L2(w−1
λ,κ)

f

(cid:55)−→ [Λα/2, wλ,κ]f

(4.1)

is continuous. That is, for all f ∈ L2(wλ,κ), there exists a constant C > 0 which depends on
α, λ, κ, and n such that,

(cid:90) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)[Λα/2, wλ,κ]f

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 dx

wλ,κ

(cid:90)

≤ C

|f|2wλ,κ dx.

• If 1 < α < 2, then for all λ ∈ (0, 1) and for all even integer κ ≥ 2, the operator Twλ,κ is

continuous from L2(wλ,κ) to L2(w−1
λ,κ).
Remark 4.2. Note that in the supercritical case, the weight wλ,κ appearing in the commutator
Twλ,κ should be denoted wλ(α) since for each ﬁxed α we have a diﬀerent weight, but for the sake
of simplicity we shall not write the dependance on α.

Proof of lemma 4.1. We ﬁrst remark that

Then, we shall use the following lemma

following inequality holds

|wλ,κ(x) − wλ,κ(y)| ≤ C(λ, κ) min

wλ,κ(x)wλ,κ(y).

C(λ, κ)|x−y|λ/2κ. By symmetry, we also have wλ,κ(y)−1/2 ≤ (1+2κ|x−y|κ)λ/2κ ≤ C(λ, κ)|x−y|λ/2.

parable, in the sense that, one may ﬁnd a constant C(λ, κ) > 0 so that wλ,κ(x) ≈ C(λ, κ)wλ,κ(y).
Therefore,
wλ,κ(x)+wλ,κ(y) ≤ C(λ, κ)wλ,κ(x) ≤ C(λ, κ)

Then, using inequality 4.2 we conclude that the commutator f (cid:55)→ Twλ,κ (f ) is a continuous operator
from L2(wλ,κ) → L2(w−1
λ,κ) for supercritical values of α. As for the subcritical case, namely
1 < α < 2, we have that, for all λ ∈ (0, 1), the function x (cid:55)→ χ(x) ∈ L1(Rn). Therefore inequality
4.3 still hold, and we may conclude as before.

4.1 Control of the L∞ norm of the nonlocal operator Λαwλ, with α ∈ (0, 2).
We shall state and prove a general lemma that deals with a bound for Λαwλ valid for all values
of α ∈ (0, 2). As a matter of fact, we shall only use the estimate for α = 1. More precisely, we
shall only use it in the study of the L2 norm, and more precisely when we will integrate by parts
and send the Λ onto the weight wλ,κ just after the use of the C´ordoba and C´ordoba inequality (see
equation 5.1).
Lemma 4.4. For all α ∈ (0, 2), for all familly of weights wλ,κ(x) = (1+|x|κ)−λ/κ, where 0 < λ < 1
and κ ≥ 2 an even integrer, there exists a constant C = C(α, λ, κ, n) > 0 such that the following
estimate holds

|Λαwλ,κ| ≤ Cwλ,κ(x)

together with the following inequality,

|∇2wλ,κ(x)| ≤ Cwλ,κ(x),

allow us to conclude that,

|I1(x)| ≤ Cwλ,κ(x).

As for the second integrale I2, we split the set Ω(x) = {y| |x − y| > 1} into two regions. Namely,
we intersect the set Ω(x) with

Ω1(x) = {|x − y| >

5 Global existence for data θ0 ∈ H k(wλ,κ) ∩ L∞

The aim of this section is to prove Theorem 2.1. We shall ﬁrst treat the case of an L2

w ∩ L∞
w ∩ L∞ with k (cid:54)= 0. Indeed, this latter case required a more

data and then the case of a data in H k
precise analysis of the low frequencies of the velocity.

5.1 The case θ0 ∈ L2(wλ,κ) ∩ L∞.

In this subsection, we study the following initial value problem, for all 1 < α < 2:

(cid:40) ∂tθ + θxHθ + νΛαθ = 0

(Tα) :

0 < θ(0, x) = θ0(x) ∈ L2(wλ,κ(x)dx) ∩ L∞

Before going into the computations to get a priori estimates, one need to check the existence of
at least a solution to equation (Tα). To do so, we truncate the initial data by multiplying by the
function x (cid:55)→ φ(x/R) that has been introduced at the end of section 3. Therefore, we focus on
equation Tα,R deﬁned as follows

(cid:40) ∂tθR + θxHθR + νΛαθR = 0

0 < θ0,R(x) = θ0(x)φ(x/R) ∈ L2 ∩ L∞

(Tα,R) :

Let θR be a solution of TR, since the initial value is in L2 and is positive, then it is classical to
prove that there exist at least one solution θR ∈ L∞([0, T ], L2) ∩ L2([0, T ], ˙H α/2) (see [14]). Then
multiplying equation TR by such a solution θR and integrating in space give

L2(w)dx ≤ C(cid:107)θ0(cid:107)L∞(cid:107)θR(cid:107)2

Integrating in time s ∈ [0, T ] yields

(cid:107)Λα/2θR(cid:107)2

Hence, by Gronwall’s inequality we get

where C > 0 depends only on (cid:107)θ0,R(cid:107)L∞ , and β. Then, the passage to the weak limit as R → ∞
allows us to prove the ﬁrst statement of Theorem 2.1. Indeed, since 1 < α < 2, one has enough
compactness to pass to the weak limit in the nonlinear term. This can be done for instance via
Rellich’s compactness theorem [25] which provides the strong convergence in (L2L2)loc of θR and
allows us to pass to the weak limit in the nonlinear term. It is obvious that θ0,R converges strongly
in L2 as well as in L∞ toward θ0. This concludes the proof.

It is worth recalling that this is an open problem in the critical or super-critical case and when
the data is just in L2 or L2
w. Although one can derive nice a priori estimates, it is still not clear
whether one can to pass to the limit because of the lack of compactness (see for instance [31], [24]).

5.2 The case k = max(0, 3/2 − α).

In this section, we study the following initial value problem for data

(Tα) :

(cid:40) ∂tθ + θxHθ + νΛαθ = 0
(cid:40) ∂tθR + ∂xθRHθR + νΛαθR = 0

0 < θ(0, x) = θ0(x) ∈ H k(w) ∩ L∞.

0 < θ0,R(x) = θ0(x)φ(x/R) ∈ H k ∩ L∞.

We shall focus on the following approximate family of equations (where φ have been introduced in
section 3).

From theorem 3.1 of [14], we know that there exists at least one solution θR ∈ L∞L2 ∩ L2H k+α/2.
For the sake of readibility, we shall omit to write the index R > 0 in the energy estimates. In order
to prove our result, we shall consider the evolution of the following weighted Sobolev norm

(cid:107)θ(cid:107)2

H k(w) =

|Λkθ|2 w(x)dx +

|θ|2 w(x)dx = (cid:107)√

As for the second sum, we need to interpolate since we do not control the L∞ norm of the low
frequencies of Hθ. More precisely, we use the fact that θ ∈ L2(w) ∩ L∞ then by interpolation
Hθ ∈ Ls(w) for all 2 < s < ∞ and we have

(cid:107)Hθ(cid:107)Ls(w) ≤ C(cid:107)θ(cid:107)1−2/s

To conclude the proof of Theorem 2.1, we pass to the weak limit as R → ∞. To do so, we
consider a sequence of solutions (θ0,m)m∈N∗ . The strong convergences of the truncated initial data
w and in L∞ are straighforward. The a priori estimates of the previous section allows us to get
in H 2
that the sequence θm is bounded in the space L∞([0, T ], H α/2(wdx))∩L2([0, T ], H k+ α
2 (wdx)) for all
0 < T < ∞. Then, if φ(x, t) ∈ D((0,∞]×R), we get that φθm is bounded in L2([0, T ], H k+ α
2 (wdx)).
In order to apply Rellich’s theorem we need a bound on ∂t(φθm) or equivatlently on the quantity
θm∂tφ + φ∂tθm. It suﬃces to focus on

φ∂tθm = −φ∂x(θmHθm) + θmΛθm − Λαθm.

Using the a priori L2([0, T ], H k+ α
with the continuity of the Hilbert transform on Sobolev spaces one easily infer that φ∂tθm is
bounded in L2([0, T ], H k− α

loc((0,∞) × R)
lows us to get the existence of a subsquence θmn that converges strongly in L2
toward a function θ. Using that θmn is a bounded sequence in L∞([0, T ], H k(w(x)dx)) and on
L2([0, T ], ˙H k+α/2(w(x)dx)) whose dual spaces are separable Banach spaces, we obtain the *-weak
convergence when mn → +∞ of the subsequence θmn toward θ in the spaces L∞([0, T ], H k(wdx))
loc((0,∞)×R) one can pass to the weak limit
and L2([0, T ], H k+ α

6 Local existence in H 2(wλ,κ) in the case 0 < α < 1

In this section, we prove Theorem 2.2. For 0 < α < 1, we consider the following Cauchy

problem,

(Tα) :

(cid:40) ∂tθR + ∂xθRHθR + νΛαθR = 0

0 < θ0,R(x) = θ0(x) ∈ H 2(wλ,κ) ∩ L∞

Since the usual Sobolev embedding H s(w)(Rn) (cid:44)→ L∞(Rn) with s > n/2 is not anymore true for
general A∞ weights, one cannot argue as in [1] for instance. However, thanks to the pointwise

inequality (cid:18)(cid:90) |θ(x) − θ(y)|p

(cid:19)1/p ≤ C [M (|θ − θ(x)|p) (x)]

valid for all s ∈ (0, 1), p ∈ [1,∞) and q ≥ pn
n+p , one recover the weighted Gagliardo-Niremberg
and the weighted Sobolev inequalities (with p (cid:54)= ∞). In particular, we can recover the weighted
Sobolev embedding type ˙H 2+s/2(w) (cid:44)→ ˙W 2, 2
1−s (w) for all s ∈ (0, 1). For a proof of 6.1, we refer to
the book of Maz’ya [27], p 641.

We shall study the following truncated equation and get a priori estimates uniformly in R > 0

Where the function φR(x) have been introduced in the end of section 3. Then, via ([1], Theorem

converges weakly to some θ. Moreover, writting that η∂tθk = −η∂x(θkHθk) + ηθkΛθk − ηΛαθk

we get, by the a priori bound in the space L2([0, T ∗], ˙H 2+ α
η∂tθk is bounded in L2([0, T ∗], ˙H 1+ α
2 (wdx)). Therefore, one obtains the strong convergence of a
subsequence θkn(cid:48) to a function θ in (L2((0, T ∗] × R))loc which allows to pass to the limit in the
nonlinearity. Then, it is classical to prove that the limit is a solution to the equation in the weak
sense.
