1. Introduction

Let G be a noncompact simple Lie group of adjoint type and K ⊂ G a maximal
compact subgroup, such that K\G is an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of non-
compact type. The Lie algebra of G will be denoted by g. Let Γ be a closed torsionfree
discrete subgroup of G. Take a compact connected K¨ahler manifold X; ﬁx a base point
x0 ∈ X. Let

ρ : π1(X, x0) −→ Γ

be a homomorphism such that the adjoint action of ρ(π1(X, x0)) on g is completely re-
ducible. This ρ produces a C ∞ principal G–bundle EG −→ X equipped with a ﬂat con-
nection D. A reduction of structure group of EG to K is given by a map X −→ K\G/Γ.
Note that K\G/Γ is a K¨ahler manifold; it need not be compact.

A theorem of Corlette says that there is a C ∞ reduction of structure group of EG to K
such that corresponding map HD : X −→ K\G/Γ is harmonic [Co]. Our aim here is to
address the following:

• When is HD holomorphic?
• When is HD anti–holomorphic?

Let H : X −→ K\G/Γ be a C ∞ map giving a reduction of structure group of
EG to K. We give a criterion under which H is holomorphic or anti–holomorphic (see
Theorem 4.3). Since a holomorphic or anti–holomorphic map between K¨ahler manifolds
is harmonic, Theorem 4.3 gives criterion for HD to be holomorphic or anti–holomorphic
(see Corollary 4.4).

2. Harmonic map to G/K

A Lie group is called simple if its Lie algebra is so [He, page 131]. Let G be a connected
real noncompact simple Lie group whose center is trivial. It is known that if K1 and K2
are two maximal compact subgroups of G, then there is an element g ∈ G such that
K1 = g−1K2g [He, page 256, Theorem 2.2(ii)]. In particular, any two maximal compact
subgroups of G are isomorphic. Assume that G satisﬁes the condition that the dimension
of the center of a maximal compact subgroup K of it is positive. This in fact implies that
the center of K is isomorphic to S 1 = R/Z [He, page 382, Proposition 6.2].

Fix a maximal compact subgroup K ⊂ G. Consider the left–translation action of
K on G. The above conditions on G imply that the corresponding quotient K\G is
an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. Conversely, given any
irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, there is a group G of the
above type such that K\G is isometrically isomorphic to it [He, page 381, Theorem
6.1(i)]. In fact, this gives a bijection between the isomorphism classes of Lie groups of
the above type and the holomorphic isometry classes of irreducible Hermitian symmetric
spaces [He, page 381, Theorem 6.1(i)]. The Lie algebra of G will be denoted by g.

Fix a closed torsionfree discrete subgroup Γ ⊂ G. Therefore, the two-sided quotient
(2.1)

MΓ := K\G/Γ

is a connected K¨ahler manifold.

Let X be a compact connected orientable real manifold. Fix a base point x0 ∈ X. Let
(2.2)

β : eX −→ X

be the universal cover of X associated to x0. The right–action of the fundamental group
π1(X, x0) on eX will be denoted by “·”. Let

ρ : π1(X, x0) −→ Γ

(2.3)
be a homomorphism such that the adjoint action of ρ(π1(X, x0)) ⊂ G on the Lie algebra
g is completely reducible. Associated to ρ we have a principal G–bundle EG −→ X
equipped with a ﬂat connection D. We note that EG is the quotient of eX × G (see (2.2))
where two points (x1 , g1) , (x2 , g2) ∈ eX × G are identiﬁed if there is an element z ∈
π1(X, x0) such that x2 = x1· z and g2 = ρ(z)−1g1. The natural projection eX × G −→ eX
produces the projection EG −→ X from the quotient space, and the right–translation
action of G on eX × G produces the action of G on EG. The trivial connection on the
trivial principal G–bundle eX × G −→ eX descends to the connection D on the principal
G–bundle EG.

The above construction gives the following:

Corollary 2.1. The pulled back principal G–bundle β ∗EG is identiﬁed with the trivial
principal G–bundle eX × G by sending any (x , g) ∈ eX × G to (x , z), where z is the
equivalence class of (x , g). This identiﬁcation takes the connection β ∗D on β ∗EG to the
trivial connection on the trivial principal G–bundle eX × G.

A Hermitian structure on EG is a C ∞ reduction of structure group

EK ⊂ EG

to the maximal compact subgroup K ⊂ G. For such a reduction of structure group EK,
we have the reduction of structure group

β ∗EK ⊂ β ∗EG = eX × G −→ eX ,

where β is the projection in (2.2). Therefore, a Hermitian structure on EG is given by a
π1(X, x0)–equivariant C ∞ map

with π1(X, x0) acting on the left of G/K via the homomorphism ρ.

h : eX −→ G/K

(2.4)

Let ι : G/K −→ K\G be the isomorphism that sends a coset gK to the coset Kg−1.

Let

be the reduction of structure group to K corresponding to a map h as in (2.4). Since h
is π1(X, x0)–equivariant, the composition ι ◦ h descends to a map

EK ⊂ EG

HD : X −→ MΓ = K\G/Γ

(2.5)

(see (2.1)).

Fix a Riemannian metric gX on X. A theorem of Corlette says that there is a Hermitian
structure EK ⊂ EG such that the above map h is harmonic with respect to β ∗gX and the
natural invariant metric on G/K [Co, page 368, Theorem 3.4] (in the special case where
dim X = 2 and G = PSL(2, R), this was proved in [Do]). Note that h is harmonic if
and only if HD in (2.5) is harmonic with respect to gX and the natural metric on MΓ.
K is another Hermitian structure such that corresponding map eX −→ G/K is also
If E ′
harmonic, then there is an automorphism δ of the principal G–bundle EG such that

• δ preserves the ﬂat connection D on EG, and
• δ(EK) = E ′
K.
In other words, if h′
this E ′

K, then then there is an element g ∈ G such that
• g commutes with ρ(π1(X, x0)), and
• h′(y) = gh(y) for all y ∈ eX.

: eX −→ G/K is the π1(X, x0)–equivariant map corresponding to

Note that the ﬁrst condition that g commutes with ρ(π1(X, x0)) implies that the map
y 7−→ gh(y) intertwines the actions of π1(X, x0) on eX and G/K.

3. Constructions using flat connection and Hermitian structure

Let G and K be as before. As before, the Lie algebra of G will be denoted by g. The

Lie algebra of K will be denoted by k. We have the isotypical decomposition

g = k ⊕ p

(3.1)

4

H. AZAD, I. BISWAS, C. S. RAJAN, AND S. SIKANDER

for the adjoint action of the center of K [He, p. 208, Theorem 3.3(iii)]. Note that the
adjoint action of K on g preserves this decomposition. Let

φ : g −→ k and ψ : g −→ p
be the projections associated to the decomposition in (3.1).

(3.2)

Let Y be a connected complex manifold, FG a C ∞ principal G–bundle on Y and DY a
ﬂat connection on the principal G–bundle FG. Fix a C ∞ reduction of structure group of
FG

to the subgroup K. Let

FK ⊂ FG

ad(FK) = FK(k) := FK ×K k −→ Y

and FK(p) := FK ×K p −→ Y

(3.3)

be the vector bundles associated to this principal K–bundle FK for the K–modules k and
p respectively. Let ad(FG) = FG ×G g −→ Y be the adjoint vector bundle for FG. From
(3.1) it follows that

ad(FG) = ad(FK) ⊕ FK(p) .

(3.4)

The connection DY on FG is deﬁned by a g–valued 1–form on the total space of FG;
this form on FG will also be denoted by DY . The restriction of this form DY to FK will
be denoted by D′. Consider the k–valued 1–form φ ◦ D′ on FK, where φ is the projection
in (3.2). It is K–equivariant and restricts to the Maurer–Cartan form on the ﬁbers of the
principal K–bundle FK. Hence φ ◦ D′ is a connection on FK; we will denote by DK this
connection on FK. Consider the p–valued 1–form ψ ◦ D′ on FK, where ψ is the projection
in (3.2). It is K–equivariant and its restriction to any ﬁber of the principal K–bundle FK
vanishes identically. Therefore, ψ ◦ D′ is a C ∞ section FK(p) ⊗ T ∗Y , where FK(p) is the
vector bundle deﬁned in (3.3), and T ∗Y is the real cotangent bundle of Y . Let

DY,p ∈ C ∞(Y, FK(p) ⊗ T ∗Y )

(3.5)

be this FK(p)–valued 1–form on Y .

Using the complex structure on Y we may decompose any FK(p)–valued 1–form on Y

into a sum of FK(p)–valued forms of types (1 , 0) and (0 , 1). Let

DY,p = D1,0 + D0,1

(3.6)

be the decomposition of the above FK(p)–valued 1–form DY,p into (1 , 0) and (0 , 1) parts.

Deﬁne

ωDY :=

1

√−1

(D1,0 − D0,1) ∈ C ∞(Y, (ad(FG) ⊗ T ∗Y ) ⊗R C) ,

where D1,0 and D0,1 are constructed in (3.6). From (3.6) it follows that

ωDY ∈ C ∞(Y, FK(p) ⊗ T ∗Y ) ⊂ C ∞(Y, (ad(FG) ⊗ T ∗Y ) ⊗R C)
In other words, ωDY is a real 1–form on Y with values in the real vector

(see (3.4)).

4. Criterion for holomorphicity

We now work in the set-up of Section 2. Assume that the manifold X is equipped with
a complex structure. Identify two elements (g1 , g′
2) of (K\G) × G if there
is an element γ ∈ Γ such that g2 = g1γ −1 and g′
1. The corresponding quotient
will be denoted by EG. The group G acts on EG; the action of any g ∈ G sends the
equivalence class of (g1 , g′
1g). Consider
the map

1) ∈ (K\G) × G to the equivalence class of (g1 , g′

1) and (g2 , g′
2 = γg′

EG −→ MΓ = K\G/Γ

that sends the equivalence class of any (g , g′) ∈ (K\G) × G to the equivalence class of
g. It, and the above action of G on EG, together make EG a principal G–bundle on MΓ.
Pull back the left invariant Maurer–Cartan form on G using the projection to the second
factor (K\G)× G −→ G. This pulled back form descends to the quotient space EG. It is
straight-forward to check that this descended form deﬁnes a connection on the principal
G–bundle EG. This connection on EG will be denoted by D0. The connection D0 is ﬂat.

Consider the submanifold {(g−1 , g) | g ∈ G} ⊂ G × G. Let

be the image of it under the obvious quotient map. Let

N ⊂ (K\G) × G

(4.1)

(4.2)
be the image of N in the quotient space EG (recall that EG is a quotient of (K\G)× G). It
is straight-forward to check that the action of the subgroup K ⊂ G on EG preserves EK.
More precisely, EK is a reduction of structure group of the principal G–bundle EG −→ MΓ
to the subgroup K ⊂ G.

EK ⊂ EG

Take ρ as in (2.3). As in Section 2, let (EG , D) denote the associated ﬂat principal
G–bundle over the compact complex manifold X. Take any C ∞ reduction of structure
group

EK ⊂ EG

to K ⊂ G.
Proposition 4.1. The pulled back principal G–bundle H ∗
DEG, where HD is constructed in
(2.5), is canonically identiﬁed with the principal G–bundle EG. This identiﬁcation between
EG and H ∗

DEG takes

(1) the pulled back connection H ∗
(2) the reduction H ∗

DEK ⊂ H ∗

DD0 to the connection D on EG, and

DEG (see (4.2)) to the reduction EK ⊂ EG.

Proof. Consider the pulled back reduction of structure group β ∗EK ⊂ β ∗EG, where β is
the universal cover in (2.2). From Corollary 2.1 we know that β ∗EG = eX × G. Let

f ′ : β ∗EK −→ G

be the composition

β ∗EK ֒→ β ∗EG

∼

−→ eX × G

pr2−→ G ,

6

H. AZAD, I. BISWAS, C. S. RAJAN, AND S. SIKANDER

where pr2 is the projection to the second factor. Now deﬁne the map
f ′′ : β ∗EK −→ (K\G) × G , z 7−→ ( ^f ′(z)−1 , f ′(z)) ,

where ^f ′(z)−1 ∈ K\G is the image of f ′(z)−1 under the quotient map G −→ K\G. The
Galois group π1(X, x0) for β has a natural right–action of the pullback β ∗EK that lifts
the right–action of π1(X, x0) on eX. For any z ∈ β ∗EK and γ ∈ π1(X, x0), we have

f ′′(z · γ) = ( ^f ′(z)−1ρ(γ) , ρ(γ)−1f ′(z)) ,

where z · γ ∈ β ∗EK is the image of z under the action of γ. This, and the fact that
image(f ′′) ⊂ N (deﬁned in (4.1)), together imply that f ′′ descends to a map

ed : EK −→ EK

(see (4.2)). This map ed is clearly K–equivariant, and the following diagram is commutative

EK

y

X

ed−→ EK
y
HD−→ M

Therefore, we get an isomorphism of principal K–bundles

(4.3)
Since EG (respectively, EG) is the extension of structure group of EK (respectively, EK)
using the inclusion of K in G, the isomorphism f in (4.3) produces an isomorphism of
principal G–bundles

f : EK −→ H ∗

DEK .

bf : EG −→ H ∗

DEG .

It is straight–forward to check that bf takes the connection D to the connection H ∗

DD0. (cid:3)
Deﬁne EK(p) := EK ×K p −→ MΓ as in (3.3). Also, construct the associated vector

bundle EK(p) on X as done in (3.3).

Corollary 4.2. The pulled back vector bundle H ∗
canonically isomorphic to EK(p).

DEK(p), where HD is deﬁned in (2.5), is

Proof. The isomorphism f in (4.3) between principal K–bundles produces an isomorphism
between the associated vector bundles.
(cid:3)

Let

(4.4)
be the real 1–form constructed as in (3.7) for the pair (D0 ,EK). Using the isomorphisms
in Proposition 4.1 and Corollary 4.2, together with the homomorphism

ωD0 ∈ C ∞(MΓ, EK(p) ⊗R T ∗MΓ)

the pulled back section H ∗

(dHD)∗ : H ∗

DT ∗MΓ −→ T ∗X ,

DωD0 produces a section
^H ∗
DωD0 ∈ C ∞(X, EK(p) ⊗R T ∗X) .

Let

be the real 1–form constructed as in (3.7) for the pair (D , EK).

ωD ∈ C ∞(X, EK(p) ⊗ T ∗X)

(4.6)

Theorem 4.3. The map HD is holomorphic if and only if ^H ∗
(4.6)).

DωD0 = ωD (see (4.5) and

The map HD is anti–holomorphic if and only if ^H ∗

DωD0 = −ωD.

Proof. The real tangent bundle T MΓ of MΓ = K\G/Γ is identiﬁed with the associated
vector bundle EK(p), where EK is the principal K–bundle in (4.2). Also, we have H ∗
DEK =
EK by Proposition 4.1. Combining these we conclude that the vector bundle EK(p) −→
DT MΓ. The EK(p)–valued 1–form Dp ∈
X in (3.3) is identiﬁed with the pullback H ∗
C ∞(X, EK(p) ⊗ T ∗X), obtained by substituting (X , D , EK) in place of (Y , DY , FK) in
(3.5), coincides with the section given by the diﬀerential

From this it follows that ωD in (4.6) is the section given by the homomorphism

dHD : T X −→ H ∗

DT MΓ .

DT MΓ , v 7−→ dHD(JX(v)) ,
where JX : T X −→ T X is the almost complex structure on X.

T X −→ H ∗

Let

D0,p ∈ C ∞(MΓ, EK(p) ⊗ T ∗MΓ)

be the section constructed just as DY,p is constructed in (3.5) after substituting (EG ,D0 ,EK)
in place of (Y , DY , FK). This D0,p coincides with the section given by the identity map
of T MΓ (recall that T MΓ is identiﬁed with EK(p)). Therefore, the section ωD0 in (4.4)
coincides with the section given by the almost complex structure

JMΓ : T MΓ −→ T MΓ

on MΓ. Consequently, ^H ∗
DωD0 = −ωD) if and only if the
diﬀerential dHD takes the almost complex structure JX to JMΓ (respectively, −JMΓ). This
completes the proof.

DωD0 = ωD (respectively, ^H ∗

(cid:3)

Now assume that the complex manifold X is K¨ahler. This means that X is equipped

with a Hermitian structure gX such that

• the almost complex structure JX on X is orthogonal with respect to gX, and
• the (1 , 1) on X associate to the pair (gX , JX) is closed.

If A and B are K¨ahler manifolds, then any holomorphic map A −→ B is harmonic
[EL, page 1, § (1.2)(e)], [Li]. This implies that any anti–holomorphic map A −→ B is
also harmonic; to see this simply replace the almost complex structure JA of A by the
almost complex structure −JA. Therefore, Theorem 4.3 has the following corollary:

8

H. AZAD, I. BISWAS, C. S. RAJAN, AND S. SIKANDER

Corollary 4.4. Take the Hermitian structure on EG given by a map HD : X −→
K\G/Γ. If ^H ∗

DωD0 = ωD, then the map

X −→ K\G/Γ

given by a harmonic metric in [Co] is holomorphic. In that case HD gives a harmonic
metric. Conversely, if HD gives a harmonic metric and ^H ∗
DωD0 = ωD, then HD is
holomorphic.

Take the Hermitian structure on EG given by a map HD : X −→ K\G/Γ.
If
^H ∗
DωD0 = −ωD, then the map X −→ K\G/Γ given by a harmonic metric in [Co] is
anti–holomorphic. In that case HD gives a harmonic metric. Conversely, if HD gives a
harmonic metric and ^H ∗

DωD0 = −ωD, then HD is anti–holomorphic.
