GENERIC POINTS FOR DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS WITH

AVERAGE SHADOWING

DOMINIK KWIETNIAK, MARTHA ŁĄCKA, AND PIOTR OPROCHA

Abstract. It is proved that to every invariant measure of a compact dynam-
ical system one can associate a certain asymptotic pseudo orbit such that any
point asymptotically tracing in average that pseudo orbit is generic for the
measure. It follows that the asymptotic average shadowing property implies
that every invariant measure has a generic point. The proof is based on the
properties of the Besicovitch pseudometric DB which are of independent in-
terest. It is proved among the other things that the set of generic points of
ergodic measures is a closed set with respect to DB. It is also showed that the
weak speciﬁcation property implies the average asymptotic shadowing prop-
erty thus the theory presented generalizes most known results on the existence
of generic points for arbitrary invariant measures.

The speciﬁcation property or one of its variants are often applied in the theory
of dynamical systems1 to construct invariant measures with special properties (for
example, measures of maximal entropy or an equilibrium states, see [6, 9]). These
properties also help to deﬁne points with predetermined statistical behaviour like
generic points or “non-typical” points, see [4, 9]. Here, we show how to construct
generic points using a weaker notion of the asymptotic shadowing with respect
to the Besicovitch pseudometric in place of speciﬁcation. This generalizes several
results in the literature, see [7, 8, 31, 32, 33, 34].

Weyl pseudodistance and the accompanying notion of quasi-unifrom convergence
were also widely studied, see [13, 18].

It turns out that a point is generic for a non-necessarily ergodic measure if it
asymptotically traces a special approximate trajectory (which in turn is a variant of
the average asymptotic pseudoorbit), where the Besicovitch pseudodistance is used

to deﬁne the pseudotrajectory and measures the accuracy of tracing. Therefore
if a system has the asymptotic average shadowing property, then every invariant
measure has a generic point, because in such a system every average asymptotic
pseudoorbit is followed by the orbit of some point.2 The asymptotic average shad-
owing property was introduced by Gu in [17]. Recall that x ∈ X is generic for µ

It is known that for every ergodic T -invariant measure µ almost every point x ∈ X
is generic for µ. Non-ergodic invariant measures need not to have generic points.
Sigmund proved that if a dynamical system has the periodic speciﬁcation prop-
erty (see [32]), then every invariant measure has a generic point. Many authors
generalized this result.

In order to compare our result with earlier developments we show that yet an-
other variant of speciﬁcation, known as the weak speciﬁcation property implies the
asymptotic average shadowing property. This together with results of [19] gives us
the following diagram illustrating the connections between main generalizations of
speciﬁcation (we refer the reader to [22] for more details; here “AASP” stands for
“(the) asymptotic average shadowing property”):

It follows that our approach generalizes all known constructions of generic points
using speciﬁcation (recall that we need a weaker condition that the asymptotic av-
erage shadowing property). Furthermore, it is proved in [23] that there are systems
with the weak speciﬁcation property, but without the almost speciﬁcation prop-
erty, hence there are systems with the asymptotic average shadowing property, but
without almost speciﬁcation property. This answers a problem we considered in
[19]. We ﬁnish the paper with an example demonstrating that there are proximal
systems with the average shadowing property, which also answers some natural
questions one may ask about properties of systems with a generalized shadowing.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall some standard deﬁni-
tions from topological dynamics and related ﬁelds. Section 2 discusses the deﬁnition
and basic properties of the Besicovitch pseudometric. In Section 3 we show that
a set of measures generated by an orbit varies continuously as a function from X
equipped with the Besicovitch pseudometric to the space of compact subsets of
invariant measures considered with the Hausdorﬀ distance. It follows that the set
of generic points of ergodic measures is a closed set with respect to the Besicov-
itch pseudodistance. Section 4 establishes the relation between weak speciﬁcation
property and asymptotic average shadowing property. Our main result regarding
the existence of generic points is stated and proved in Section 5. Section 6 contains
an example of a proximal, mixing shift space exhibiting the average shadowing
property, but neither almost nor weak speciﬁcation.

2When we had ﬁnished writing this paper we learned about [10], which also contains a con-
struction of generic points for arbitrary invariant measure of a system with the asymptotic average
shadowing property. Our proof is diﬀerent and easily applies to systems not covered by [10], see
Example 23.

1. Topological dynamics

Notation. Throughout this paper a pair (X, T ) is a dynamical system. This means
that X is a compact metric space and T : X → X is a continuous map. All
properties of T considered here are invariants of topological conjugacy, hence they
do not depend on the choice of metric. Therefore we ﬁx a metric ρ for X and
assume without loss of generality that the diameter of X is equal to 1.

Given a compact metric space Y and A ⊂ Y we denote by dist(y, A) the distance
of a point y ∈ Y to the set A. For ε > 0 we write Aε for the ε-hull of A, that is the
set {y ∈ X : dist(y, A) < ε}. Let 2Y = {K ⊂ Y : K compact and K (cid:54)= ∅} and
HY : 2Y × 2Y → R+ be the Hausdorﬀ metric on 2Y given by

HY (A, B) = max(cid:8) inf{ε > 0 : B ⊂ Aε}, inf{ε > 0 : A ⊂ Bε}
(cid:9).

The upper asymptotic density of A ⊂ N0 is as usual denoted by ¯d(A). The asymp-
totic density of A is given by

d(A) = lim
n→∞

#(A ∩ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1})

n

provided the limit exists.

Recurrence properties. Recall that T is transitive if for all non-empty open
sets U, V ⊂ X there exists n ≥ 0 such that T n(U ) ∩ V (cid:54)= ∅. We say that T is
(topologically) mixing if for all non-empty open sets U, V ⊂ X there exists N ≥ 0
such that for all n ≥ N one has T n(U ) ∩ V (cid:54)= ∅. Finally, T is weakly mixing if the
product system T × T is transitive.

Weak speciﬁcation. An orbit segment of a point x over an interval [a, b], where
a ≤ b are nonnegative integers is the sequence

T [a,b](x) = (T a(x), T a+1(x), . . . , T b−1(x), T b(x)).

Let N : N → N be any function. A family of orbit segments ξ = {T [aj ,bj ](xj)}n
j=1 is
an N-spaced speciﬁcation if ai − bi−1 ≥ N (bi − ai + 1) for 2 ≤ i ≤ n. A speciﬁcation
ξ = {T [aj ,bj ](xj)}n

j=1 is ε-traced by y ∈ X if

ρ(T k(y), T k(xi)) ≤ ε

for ai ≤ k ≤ bi and 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

A dynamical system (X, T ) has the weak speciﬁcation property if for every ε > 0
there is a nondecreasing function Mε : N → N with Mε(n)/n → 0 as n → ∞ such
that any Mε-spaced speciﬁcation is ε-traced by some point in X. We refer the
reader to [22] for more information about speciﬁcation.
Invariant measures. Let M(X) be the set of all Borel probability measures on
X. Let −→d : M(X) × M(X) → R+ be the Prokhorov metric, that is let

−→d (µ, ν) = inf(cid:8)ε > 0 : µ(B) ≤ ν(Bε) + ε for every Borel set B ⊂ X(cid:9).

It is well known that the topology induced by −→d is the weak∗ topology on M(X).
A measure µ ∈ M(X) is T -invariant, if µ(T −1(B)) = µ(B) for every Borel set B ⊂
X. We denote by MT (X) ⊂ M(X) the family of all T -invariant measures. The
measure center of (X, T ) is the smallest closed subset F of X such that µ(F ) = 1
for every T -invariant measure µ.

For x ∈ X let ˆδ(x) ∈ M(X) be the Dirac measure supported on {x}. Given

∞
j=0 ∈ X∞ and n ∈ N we deﬁne an empirical measure:
x = {xj}

ˆδ(xi).

∞
For x ∈ X let mT (x, n) denote the measure m({T j(x)}
j=0, n). If T is clear from the
context, then we write m(x, n) for mT (x, n). We call such a measure an empirical
measure of x. A point x ∈ X is called generic for µ ∈ M(X) if the sequence
∞
n=0 converges to µ in the weak∗ topology.
{mT (x, n)}
∞
A measure µ ∈ M(X) is a distribution measure for a sequence x = {xn}
n=0 ∈
X∞ if µ is a limit of some subsequence of {m(x, n)}
∞
n=1. The set of all distribu-
tion measures of a sequence x is denoted by ˆω(x). Clearly, ˆω(x) is a closed and
nonempty subset of M(X) (since M(X) is compact), it is also connected, because
−→d (m(x, n), m(x, n + 1)) → 0 as n → ∞.
Symbolic dynamics. Let A be a ﬁnite set of symbols with discrete topology. Let
∞ be a product topological spaces. By σ we denote the continuous onto map

2. Besicovitch Pseudometric

To elucidate the construction of generic points we introduce the Besicovitch
pseudometric. Recall that a pseudometric on X is a function p : X × X → [0,∞)
which is symmetric, obeys the triangle inequality, and p(x, x) = 0 for all x ∈ X.
Every pseudometric space is a topological space in a natural manner, and most
notions deﬁned for metric spaces, like the (uniform) equivalence of metrics, remain
meaningful for pseudometric spaces.

Recall that X∞ denotes the set of all sequences indexed with nonnegative integers
with entries in X. Given T : X → X we can deﬁne a map (also denoted by T ) on
∞
n=0 ∈ X∞. We deﬁne the shift map
X∞ by T (x) = {T (xn)}
∞
n=0 for any x = {xn}
∞
on X∞ by σ(x)n = xn+1 for n ∈ N0 and x = {xn}
n=0 ∈ X∞.
We can restate the deﬁnition of a pseudo orbit in our notation as follows: a
n=0 ∈ X∞ is a δ-pseudo orbit if Dsup(T (x), σ(x)) < δ, where
∞
sequence x = {xn}
Dsup denotes the supremum metric on X∞. The orbit of y ∈ X is said to ε-trace
x ∈ X∞ if the sequence of {T n(y)}
∞
n=0 ∈ X∞ is ε-close to x in the Dsup sense.
It turns out that in order to construct invariant measures and generic points it is
convenient to work with the following pseudometric on X∞.
Deﬁnition 1. The Besicovitch pseudometric DB on X∞ is deﬁned for x = {xn}
∞
n=0,

x(cid:48) = {x(cid:48)

The Besicovitch pseudometric on (X, T ), also denoted by DB, equals the DB-
distance between orbits, that is,

DB(x, x(cid:48)

∞
) = DB({T n(x)}

n=0,{T n(x(cid:48)

∞
n=0).
)}

It is easy to see that these functions are indeed pseudometrics on X∞ and X,
respectively. Furthermore, DB is σ-invariant on X∞ and T -invariant on X. Besi-
covitch used a similar pseudodistance in his study of almost periodic functions,
but the idea of measuring the average distance along two orbits in a dynamical
systems is so natural that probably it has been reinvented independently by many
authors, see Aulsander [2] who mentions earlier works of Fomin and Oxtoby, or
[5, 11, 12, 15, 28] for more recent applications.

The pseudometric DB depends on ρ but this is not reﬂected in our notation be-
cause we will show that equivalent metrics induce uniformly equivalent Besicovitch
pseudometrics.
Lemma 2. Let X be a compact metric space and ρ be a compatible metric on
X. Then the Besicovitch pseudometric and the pseudometric D(cid:48)
B on X∞ given for
∞

i=0 and z = {zi}
i=0 by
x = {xi}

D(cid:48)
B(x, z) = inf{δ > 0 : ¯d({n ≥ 0 : ρ(xn, zn) ≥ δ}) < δ}

are uniformly equivalent on X∞.
Proof. Given x, z ∈ X∞ and δ > 0 we deﬁne

We have

Jδ(x, z) = {n ≥ 0 : ρ(xn, zn) ≥ δ}.

δ · χδ(n) ≤ ρ(xn, zn) ≤ diam X · χδ(n) + δ.

Summing the above from n = 0 to N − 1, dividing by N and passing with N to
inﬁnity we get
(1)

δ · ¯d(Jδ(x, z)) ≤ DB(x, z) ≤ diam X · ¯d(Jδ(x, z)) + δ.

Note also that

D(cid:48)
B(x, z) < ε if and only if ¯d(Jε(x, z)) < ε.

(2)
Fix ε > 0. We claim that if δ < min{ε/2, ε/(2 diam X)}, then D(cid:48)
plies DB(x, z) < ε. To prove the claim assume that D(cid:48)
and use (2) to see that the right hand side of (1) is strictly smaller than ε. This
proves our claim and yields uniform continuity of id : (X∞, D(cid:48)

B(x, z) < min{ε/2, ε/(2 diam X)}

B(x, z) < δ im-

B) → (X∞, DB).

We now show that id : (X∞, DB) → (X∞, D(cid:48)
B) is uniformly continuous. Fix
ε > 0 and δ < ε2. Take any pair x, z ∈ X∞ such that DB(x, z) < δ. Then by the
ﬁrst inequality in (1) and the deﬁnition of δ we see that
ε · ¯d(Jε(x, z)) ≤ DB(x, z) < ε2.

Therefore ¯d(Jε(x, z)) < ε, which implies that D(cid:48)

B(x, z) < ε by (2).

(cid:3)

Lemma 2 yields immediately the following corollary (for a proof it is enough to

note that if ρ and ˜ρ are uniformly equivalent, then so are D(cid:48)
B and ˜D(cid:48)
B).
Corollary 3. Let ˜ρ be another compatible metric on X and ˜DB and ˜D(cid:48)
B be deﬁned
as above with ˜ρ in place of ρ. Then ˜DB and DB are uniformly equivalent on X∞.
We will now prove that if (X, σ) is a shift space (symbolic dynamical system),
then the Besicovitch pseudometric is uniformly equivalent with the ¯d-pseudometric
measuring the upper asymptotic density of the set of coordinates at which two
symbolic sequences diﬀer. This is probably a folklore, but for completeness we
present a proof inspired by [13].
Let (X, T ) be a dynamical systems and x ∈ X. We deﬁne xT to be the sequence
x, T (x), T 2(x), . . . ∈ X∞. Given a continuous function f : X → R we deﬁne
and for any family F containing continuous functions from X to R we set

f (xT ) = (f (x), f (T (x)), . . . , f (T n(x)), . . .) ∈ R∞

DF
B (x, x(cid:48)

) = sup
f∈F

DB(f (xT ), f (x(cid:48)

T )).

B are uniformly equivalent on X.

Theorem 4. Let (X, T ) be a dynamical system and let F be a uniformy equicon-
tinuous and uniformly bounded family of real-valued functions on X such that
FT = {f ◦ T j : f ∈ F, j ≥ 0} separates the points of X. Then the pseudometrics
DB and DF
Proof. Using compactness it is easy to see that if the family FT separates the points
∞
of X, then there exists a sequence {fn}
n=1 ⊂ FT separating the points of X, where
fn = gn ◦ T k(n) for some k(n) ≥ 0 and gn ∈ F. Let x, x(cid:48)
∈ X and n ≥ 1. Deﬁne
z = T k(n)(x) and z(cid:48) = T k(n)(x(cid:48)). Note that

DB(fn(xT ), fn(x(cid:48)

T )) = DB(gn(zT ), gn(z(cid:48)

T )) = DB(gn(xT ), gn(x(cid:48)

T )).

To prove that

conclude that thanks to the uniform boundedness of F it is enough to show that

for every f ∈ F we have

4. Weak specification implies the asymptotic average shadowing

property

In [19] it was proved that a surjective system with the almost speciﬁcation prop-
erty satisﬁes the asymptotic average shadowing property. On the other hand it
follows from [23] that the notions of almost speciﬁcation and weak speciﬁcation
are independent, that is there exist: a system with the weak speciﬁcation prop-
erty which does not have the almost speciﬁcation property and a system satisfying
the almost speciﬁcation property without the weak speciﬁcation property. In this
section we will show that weak speciﬁcation also implies the asymptotic average
shadowing property.
Recall that g : N × (0, ε0) → N0, where ε0 > 0, is a mistake function if for
all ε < ε0 and all n ∈ N we have g(n, ε) ≤ g(n + 1, ε) and g(n, ε)/n → 0 as
n → ∞. Given a mistake function g we deﬁne a function kg : (0,∞) → N by
kg(ε) = min{n ∈ N : g(m, ε) < mε for all m ≥ n}. For 0 < ε < ε0 and n ≥ kg(ε)
large enough for the inequality g(n, ε) < n to hold we set

I(g; n, ε) := {Λ ⊂ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} : #Λ ≥ n − g(n, ε)}.

Given x ∈ X, ε > 0, n ∈ N and a mistake function g we deﬁne a Bowen ball by

Bn(x, ε) =(cid:8)y ∈ X : ρ(cid:0)T j(x), T j(y)(cid:1) < ε for every 0 ≤ j < n(cid:9)
Bn(g; x, ε) =(cid:8)y ∈ X : {0 ≤ j < n : ρ(T j(x), T j(y)) < ε} ∈ I(g, n, ε)(cid:9).

and a Bowen ball with mistakes by

We also need the following:

Lemma 16 ([22], Theorem 17). Let (X, T ) be a dynamical system. If T is surjective
and has the weak speciﬁcation property, then T is mixing.

Lemma 17. Let (X, T ) be a surjective dynamical system with the weak speciﬁcation
property and Mε(n) is the constant associated to ε > 0 and n ∈ N in the deﬁnition
of the weak speciﬁcation property. Assume we are given

Then, setting

we can ﬁnd z ∈ X such that for every j ∈ N we have
T lj (z) ∈ Bnj (g; xj, εj),
where g : N × (0, 1) → N is given by g(n, ε) = Mε/2(n).

n=1 ⊂ X such that for every

Observe that if we put m = k + Mε(k) for some k ∈ N and ε > 0 then Mε(m) ≥
Mε(k). It follows that (7) implies that

(8)

We will now deﬁne z1. Take j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , α2 − 1} and note that if we set

aj = lj−1 + Mε1/2(nj) and bj = lj−1 + nj, then

is an Mε1/2(n1)-spaced speciﬁcation. By the weak speciﬁcation property, there
exists z1 satisfying

for each j = 1, . . . , α2 − 1. Indeed (7) holds for i = 1.

Assume that we have constructed a point zk satisfying (7). Then the sequence

T lj (z1) ∈ Bnj−Mε1/2(nj )

an Mεαk+1 /2(nαk+1)-spaced speciﬁcation. Using the weak speciﬁcation property we
ﬁnd a point zk+1 which εαk+1/2-traces the speciﬁcation given by (9). Observe that
for s = 1, . . . , k and j = αs, . . . , αs+1 − 1 we have
εj · (1 − 1/2k−s+1) + εαk+1/2 = εj · (1 − 1/2k−s+2) −

hence (7) is satisﬁed also with i = k + 1. Finally note that d(zn, zn+1) < εαn+1 for
∞
every n, hence {zn}
n=1 is a Cauchy sequence. Putting z = limn→∞ zn ends the
(cid:3)
proof by (8).

The next theorem is an analog of [19, Theorem 3.5]. Although the weak speci-
ﬁcation property and the almost speciﬁcation property are independent the proof
follows the same lines.

Theorem 18. If a surjective dynamical system (X, T ) has the weak speciﬁcation
property, then it has the asymptotic average shadowing property.

Proof. The proof [19, Theorem 3.5] relies on chain mixing of every surjective dy-
namical system with the almost speciﬁcation property ([19, Lemma 3.2]) and [19,
Lemma 3.4]. The latter result is analogous to Lemma 17 with the only diﬀer-
ence, that the almost speciﬁcation property is replaced by the weak speciﬁcation
property. Therefore the Theorem follows from the proof of [19, Theorem 3.5] with
Lemma 16 and 17 used where [19, Lemma 3.2] and [19, Lemma 3.4] were applied
(cid:3)
in [19].

Remark 19. In fact, it was proved in [38, Corollary 6.9] that there is no need to
assume that T is surjective in [19, Theorem 3.5]. We do not know whether the
surjectivity assumption can be relaxed in Theorem 18.

(2) Di = int(Di) for each 0 ≤ i < n,

n=0 is an average asymptotic pseudo orbit for T r.
(2) If x ∈ X is such that DB(z(cid:48), xT r ) = 0, then DB(z, xT ) = 0.
Now we are ready to prove the following.

{sN : N ∈ N}

Theorem 21. Assume that (X, T ) is a dynamical system with a regular periodic
decomposition {D0, . . . , Dr−1} and that (D0, T r) has the asymptotic average shad-
owing property. If V ⊂ MT(X) is nonempty, closed and connected, then there is a
point x ∈ X such that ˆω(x) = V . In particular, every T -invariant measure has a
generic point.
Proof. Let V be a nonempty, closed and connected subset of MT(X). Sigmund (see
∞
[34, Remark 1]) proved that there is an asymptotic average pseudoorbit z = {zn}
n=0
for T such that ˆω(z) = V (note that Sigmund used diﬀerent terminology). It is
easy to see that actually [34, Remark 1] allows us to assume that zk = T k−sN (yN )
∞
∞
k=0 ⊂ N and {yN}
N =0 ⊂ D0 such
for sN ≤ k < sN +1 for some sequences {nk}
that 0 = n0 < n1 < n2 < . . . and nk = 0 (mod r). By Remark 20 the sequence
∞
z(cid:48) = {znr}
n=0 is an average asymptotic pseudo-orbit for T r and furthermore, by
deﬁnition we obtain that also z(cid:48)
⊂ D0. Let x ∈ D0 asymptotically trace on average
z(cid:48) for T r. Then DB(z(cid:48), xT r ) = 0 and using Remark 20 one more time we get
DB(z, xT ) = 0. By Corollary 8 we have ˆω(x) = ˆω(z) = V which ends the proof. (cid:3)
Since it is proved in [19] that the almost speciﬁcation property implies the average
shadowing property and in Section 4 we have shown that the same follows from
the weak speciﬁcation property, Theorem 21 immediately implies the following
corollary, which can be also found in [10] (with a diﬀerent proof).

Corollary 22. If (X, T ) is surjective and has the relative weak speciﬁcation prop-
erty (or relative almost speciﬁcation property), then for every asymptotic average
∞
i=0 ∈ X∞ there exists a point z such that ˆω(x) = ˆω(z). In
pseudo orbit x = {xi}
particular, if V ⊂ MT(X) is nonempty, closed and connected, then there is a point
z ∈ X such that ˆω(z) = V and every T -invariant measure has a generic point.

Corollary 22 extends results from [7, 8, 31, 32, 33, 34].

Example 23. The following example shows that there are maps which do not have
the asymptotic average shadowing property but have a regular periodic decompo-
sition {D0, . . . , Dr−1} such that T r|D0 satisﬁes the asymptotic average shadowing
property.

To see that Fn does not have the asymptotic average shadowing property notice
that the Lebesgue measure is a fully supported invariant measure for Fn. By [19,

6. Shift space with the asymptotic shadowing property but without

almost specification

In this section we show that the proximal dynamical system Y with positive
entropy introduced in [27] has the average shadowing property and fully supported
invariant measure. By [23, Theorem 5.3], a nontrivial proximal system like Y never
has the almost speciﬁcation property. Recall that a pair (x, y) ∈ X × X is proximal,
if

n→∞ ρ(cid:0)T n(x), T n(y)(cid:1) = 0.

lim inf

A dynamical system is proximal if every pair (x, y) ∈ X ×X is proximal. It remains
open whether Y has the asymptotic average shadowing property.
We recall the construction from [27]. Let A = {0,♦} and let 1 < s < t be
positive integers. We deﬁne a labelled graph G(s,t) = (V, E, i, t,L) over A in the

Denote by X(s,t) the shift space consisting of sequences over A which are labels
of inﬁnite paths on G(s,t). In other words, x ∈ X(s,t) is a concatenation of blocks

It was proved in [27] that (10) implies that Y is a topologically mixing and proximal
system with positive topological entropy. Let

Yn = X (s1,t1) ∩ . . . ∩ X (sn,tn).

Lemma 24. For every ε > 0 there is n > 0 such that if x ∈ Yn, then there is z ∈ Y
with ¯d(x, z) < ε.

Take x ∈ Yn. Deﬁne z by zj = 0 if there is i > n such that p(si,ti)

Lemma 25. Let X be a shift space. If for every ε > 0 there is a shift space Xε
with the average shadowing property such that X ⊂ Xε and for every x ∈ Xε there
is z ∈ X with ¯d(x, z) < ε, then X has the average shadowing property.
Proof. Fix ε > 0. Let β > 0 be such that ¯d(x, x(cid:48)) < β implies DB(x, x(cid:48)) < ε/2
(the existence of such a β is guaranteed by Corollary 5). Consider shift space Xβ.
Use the average shadowing property for Xβ to ﬁnd δ > 0 such that every δ-average
pseudoorbit for σ contained in Xβ is ε/2 traced on average. Let x be a δ-average
pseudoorbit for σ contained in X. Since X ⊂ Xβ there is a point y ∈ Xβ which ε/2-
traces x in average. Use the assumption to ﬁnd a point z ∈ X such that ¯d(y, z) < β.

Hence DB(zT , x) ≤ DB(z, y) + DB(y
Lemma 26. For every nonempty open set U ⊂ Y there is y ∈ Y such that N (y, U )

Theorem 27. The shift space Y is mixing, has the average shadowing property,
positive topological entropy and fully supported invariant measure.
Proof. Proximality, positive topological entropy and topological mixing follows from
µ(U ) > 0 (e.g. see [16]). Then µ =(cid:80)∞
[27]. Let U = {Un : n ∈ N} be the base for the topology on Y. Lemma 26 implies
that for any open set Un ∈ U we can ﬁnd an invariant measure µn such that

n=1 2−nµn is a fully supported measure.

GENERIC POINTS FOR DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS WITH AVERAGE SHADOWING

Note that ZN =(cid:84)N
i=1 F (si,ti) is the intersection of mixing soﬁc shifts for every
N ∈ N, therefore ZN is a mixing soﬁc shift. Since every mixing soﬁc shift has
the speciﬁcation property, it follows from [20] that ZN has the asymptotic average
shadowing property and so it also has the average shadowing property by [19]. Now
(cid:3)
Y has the average shadowing property by Lemmas 24 and 25.
Corollary 28. The subshift Y has the average shadowing property but does not
have the almost speciﬁcation property.

17

Proof. By [23] minimal points are dense in the measure center of any dynamical
system with the almost speciﬁcation property. On the other hand, it follows from
Theorem 27 that Y is a nontrivial (hence uncountable) proximal system whose
measure center equals the whole space. Proximality implies that Y has a ﬁxed
point which is the unique minimal point in the system (e.g. see [1]). Therefore
minimal points of Y can not be dense in the measure center and Y can not have
(cid:3)
the almost speciﬁcation property.

Our last example shows that the assumptions of Lemma 25 can not be weakened.
Given a shift space X over an alphabet A we deﬁne the ﬁnite type approximation

of order m ∈ N of X by

∞
Xm = {x ∈ A

: ∀k ∈ N0 ∃y ∈ X x[k,k+m] = y[0,m]}.

In other words Xm is a shift of ﬁnite type determined by ﬁnite blocks of length
m + 1 occurring in X (see [9, p.111]). The following lemma is probably well-known
(cf. Proposition 3.62 in [21]).

Lemma 29. Let X be a mixing shift space. The following conditions are equivalent:

(1) X is chain mixing,
(2) Xm is mixing for every m ∈ N.

Sketch of the proof. Note that for every m the points in Xm are in the one to one
correspondence with δm-chains in X, where δm goes to 0 as m → ∞. To see this
take a point x ∈ Xm and for each j ∈ N0 pick x(j) in the cylinder in X determined
by x[j,j+m]. Furthermore, chain mixing is equivalent to mixing for systems with
the shadowing property and all shifts of ﬁnite type have the shadowing property
(cid:3)
by [36].

sequence X0 ⊃ X1 ⊃ . . . ⊃ X of mixing shifts of ﬁnite type such that X =(cid:84)∞
Note that if X =(cid:84)∞

Corollary 30. Let X be a mixing shift space. Then there exists a decreasing
n=1 Xn.
n=1 Xn and X1 ⊃ X2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ X then for every ε > 0 there
is n such that dist(x, X) < ε for each x ∈ Xn. Next Theorem shows that this is
not enough to imply the average shadowing property on the intersection and the
condition inf{ ¯d(x, y) : x ∈ X, y ∈ Xn} < ε for all n large enough in Lemma 25 is
essential.
Theorem 31. There exists a decreasing sequence X1 ⊃ X2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ X of mixing
n=1 Xn is mixing but does not have the
average shadowing property.

soﬁc shifts such that the shift space X =(cid:84)∞

Proof. Consider the shift space X constructed in Section 6 of [14]. By [14, Lem-
mas 6–8] X has the following properties:

(1) periodic points are dense,
(2) X is mixing, nontrivial and 0∞
(3) if x ∈ X is not periodic then d({i : xi = 1}) = 0.

18

DOMINIK KWIETNIAK, MARTHA ŁĄCKA, AND PIOTR OPROCHA

Since periodic points are dense and X is nontrivial, there exists a periodic point
p ∈ X such that d({i : pi = 1}) = α > 0. Using p and 0∞ interchangeably it is not
∞
hard to construct an asymptotic average pseudo-orbit {y(i)}
i=0 such that
(i) ¯d({i : y(i)
(ii) ¯d({i : y(i)
If X has the average shadowing property, then by [38, Thm. 5.5] there exists z ∈ X
such that

0 = 1}) = α > 0 and
0 = 0}) = 1.

d({i : zi = y(i)

0 }) > 1 − α/3.

This implies by (i) that ¯d({i : zi = 1}) ≥ α/2 and so z must be a periodic point
with d({i : zi = 1}) = β ≥ α/2. On the other hand by (ii) we see that d({i : zi =
0}) ≥ 1 − α/3 > 1 − β which is a contradiction. This shows that X cannot have
(cid:3)
the average shadowing property. The proof is ﬁnished by Corollary 30.
