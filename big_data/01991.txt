Abstract

In multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems,
a block diagonalization (BD) precoding scheme is ﬁrst designed to aim at minimizing the peak-to-average power
ratio (PAR) for a ﬁxed cost, which is a sum of the received SNR loss of users. Then the BD precoder is designed to
provide the required PAR at the minimum cost, which is our main goal. By the aid of the concentration of measure
property [1], [2], it is almost exactly able to provide the required PAR on average, and also provide the required
performance speciﬁed as 0.1 percent PAR in an asymptotic way.

I. INTRODUCTION

M ULTIPLE-INPUT MULTIPLE-OUTPUT (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)

have been regarded as key technologies for wireless communication systems to boost the network capacity,
but OFDM has a fundamental drawback of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) [3]. Unfortunately, this is
further intensiﬁed by MIMO precoding techniques [4], and transmitters are required to use linear power ampliﬁers,
although they are expensive [5].

Under these practical challenges, the authors of [6] and [7] have effectively used redundant spatial dimensions
based on convex optimization to make low PAR OFDM signals while providing high data rate through the inherent
MIMO precoding gain, for the multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) and single-user (SU) MIMO
cases, respectively.

In this paper, we modify the block diagonalization (BD) precoder [8], [9] by utilizing unused spatial dimensions
based on convex optimization theory, and propose MIMO precoding schemes with a focus on the PAR performance
of MU-MIMO OFDM systems. First, we propose a precoding scheme to aim at minimizing the PAR for a given
cost, which is represented as a sum of received SNR loss of users compared to those of SNRs that would have been
achieved by the original BD scheme. Second, we design the precoder that is able to provide the required PAR at
the minimum cost, which is our main goal. For this purpose, we establish the required PAR as a convex constraint
by using high dimensional property of the convex body, known as the concentration of measure phenomenon [1],
[2], and formulate a convex problem to determine the precoder that is able to minimize the cost while providing
the required PAR performance.

As a result, even if the required PAR is small, the proposed scheme is almost exactly able to provide the required
PAR on average, and asymptotically provide the required performance speciﬁed as 0.1 percent PAR, as the number
of subcarriers increases.

Throughout this paper, N, R, R+, C,D and U denote the sets of natural numbers, real numbers, positive real
numbers, complex numbers, rectangular diagonal matrices and column orthonormal matrices, respectively. For
arbitrary a, b ∈ N, a < b, deﬁne [a : b] = {a, a + 1, ..., b}, and deﬁne diag(a, b) =(cid:2)[a, 0]T , [0, b]T(cid:3). For arbitrary
matrices A, B, blkdiag(A, B) = [[A, 0]T , [0, B]T ] and N (A) means the null space of A.

In this section, we state the system model and explain the related works. Consider the MU-MIMO OFDM system

the kth subcarrier, which is drawn from a ﬁnite alphabet set A, to the jth user equipped with N antennas for
k ∈ [1 : K] and j ∈ [1 : J]. It is assumed that dj ≤ N,PJ

Minimizing (6) is a nonconvex problem since the same variables are involved both in the denominator and the
numerator as well. For this reason, the l∞-norm minimization has been largely considered as an alternative way,
which is convex approach [5]–[7]. To design F, we can intuitively formulate minkFsk∞, but its solution is always
zero. This indicates the necessity of the carefully restricted feasible space. For N = 1 and M > J, the zero-forcing
precoding criterion is deﬁned in [6] as an equality constraint. For J = 1 and N < M, the authors of [7] deﬁned a
quadratic constraint by setting the precdoer, denoted by Fk = ˙Ak + ¨AkBk, satisfying the following properties:

the cost of individual users, and it also provides the required PAR level at the minimum cost. Also, the effect of a
sufﬁciently large M is explored for a ﬁxed cost.

B. Scheme II: Cost minimization with constraint on the PAR

5

In this subsection, we make the precoder that is able to minimize the cost to achieve the required PAR. The size of
the volume (feasible space) of BC is changed according to the radius r, and r is represented as a function of αj , dj
and K as shown in (19) for all j ∈ [1 : J]. In this subsection, consider that the system parameters dj and K are still
given, while αj is unknown parameter for all j ∈ [1 : J]. Let us deﬁne r2 = (dΣ −PJ
j=1 αj dj)K = (1 − γ)dΣK,
where

γ =

(α1d1 + . . . + αJ dJ ),

(24)

1
dΣ

where γ ≤ 1. If γ is ﬁxed, there are many possible αj satisfying (24) for all j ∈ [1 : J]. Thus, αj can be determined
after design of γ. Let us substitute γ to (22), and we can ﬁnd that the effective power consumption that contributes
to the received SNR is γKPs. As a consequence, we can minimize the cost by minimizing 1 − γ while satisfying
the required PAR. The radius r = ˆr considering the resultant maximum γ = ˆγ would provide the minimum volume
of BC that contains the optimal solution (ˆt, ˆγ) to satisfy the required PAR denoted by ζ.
The PAR measures in (14) are unavailable since t, γ and αj are unknowns. By the aid of the concentration of
measure phenomenon [1], [2], we state the following proposition, and it gives us key insight to deﬁne a reasonable
PAR measure.

Proposition 2: In Theorem 1, if t ∈ RcΣdΣK and cΣ · K is an arbitrarily large number, then the optimal solution
Proof: For a notational convenience, assume m = cΣdΣK. For t ∈ Rm, (23) is deﬁned as a Euclidean ball

ˆt almost always satisﬁes kˆtk2 ≃ r2.
denoted by BR, and its volume is expressed as

For r1, r2 where r1 < r2 = r1 + ∆r1, the volume ratio is described as

vol (BR) ≈ (mπ)− 1

2(cid:0)2πe · r2(cid:14)m(cid:1) m

2 .

vol (BR(r2))
vol (BR(r1))

= (1 + ∆r1/r1)m.

(25)

(26)

(27)

It implies vol (BR(r2)) ≫ vol (BR(r1)) for a large m [1], [2]. For this reason, most of the volume exists in an
annulus of width O(cid:0) r

m(cid:1) near the boundary [12, Ch.2], where
=s (dΣ −PJ

c2

In (27), the maximum r is readily found as dΣ when αj = 0 for all j ∈ [1 : J]. Thus, the maximum r
m is represented
asq 1
ΣdΣK , where cΣ ≥ 1 and dΣ ≥ 1. In wireless communication systems, it is reasonable to consider the number
of subcarriers is at least greater than 64, i.e., K ≥ 64, and then it is readily found that r
m ≪ 1, i.e., almost all of
the volume of the high dimensional BR is concentrated near the boundary, so that almost all of the feasible space
is also concentration near the boundary, which implies that ktk2 ≃ r2.
For example, if r2 = 1.01r1 and cΣdΣK = 512, then 99.39% of the volume exists in r ∈ [r1, r2], while the
expression of vol(BC) is too complex [13, eq. (11)]. Even if the exact volume comparison is not easy, we apply
Proposition 2 for vol(BC) by following reasons. First, in case of (BC), the equality of (26) is changed to the inequality
by Riemannian volume comparison theorem in [14] that indicates the possibility of the volume concentration, and
the theoretical study [15] provides the similar volume concentration result to Proposition 2 for the geodesic ball
(BC), statistically. Based on these, let us consider kˆtk2 ≃ dΣK (1 − ˆγ) for t ∈ CcΣdΣK. Then the inequality in
(22) can be replaced by the similar equality denoted by ”≃”. As a result, by breaking the correlation between the
value of the denominator and the variable t, we can deﬁne the required PAR through the relaxation of PARLNR as

If it is feasible, ζ is achieved more accurately, when K increases and the optimal solution ˆγ is closer to 1.

Proof: First, substitute (1 − γ)dΣK to (19) of Theorem 1, then we can ﬁnd (32). Rewrite (18) as a constraint

depending on (γ, t) such that kQ(cid:0)Gt + √γ · b(cid:1)k∞ ≤pζPs/M, but this is not a convex constraint due to √γ,

and hence, we relax √γ by linear approximation as

√γ ≃

1
2

(1 + γ)

(34)

where γ = 1 − δ, and δ ∈ R+ is an arbitrary small number. Then, (33) is found. We now show the convexity of
(31), (32) and (33). First, the real line of (31) is readily convex subset.
By [10, Proposition 8.23], if f : Cn → R, then its perspective function is deﬁned as g (t, r0) = r0f(cid:16) t
r0(cid:17) where
g : Cn × R → R, and g is a convex function, if f is a convex function. Consider f (t) = tHt, r0 = 1 − γ and (31),
then g (t, 1 − γ) = tH t(cid:14) (1 − γ). Thus, (32) is a convex constraint since f (t) is convex. In (33), the inner term
of k · k∞ is convex since the sum of two afﬁne functions satisﬁes convex, and k · k∞ has been proved in Section
III-A. Thus, if ζ is achievable, there exists the optimal solution (ˆγ, ˆt). In Proposition 2, most of the volume is
2(cid:17), and the width becomes increasingly thinner as K increases,
contained in an annulus of width O(cid:16)(cid:0)c2

which makes more tight approximation of ζ. As ˆγ is closer to 1, the improved accuracy of the approximation of
√ˆγ makes a more accurate constraint (33).

ΣdΣK(cid:1)− 1

Notice that if ζ is so close to 1, there would not exist (ˆt, ˆγ), since ζ = 1 is the ideal PAR performance. We
describe the overall design procedure. The ﬁrst step is the same as Section III-A except for αj decision. Step 2)

ﬁnd the solution (ˆγ, ˆt) of Corollary 1 by using IPMs, and determine ˆTk = fmat(cid:0)ˆtk(cid:1) ∀k ∈ [1 : K], ˆT and ˆF. Step
3) determine αj subject to ˆγdΣ =PJ

j=1 αjdj.

C. Discussion

In this subsection, we brieﬂy discuss some related issues. First, αj of Section III-B could be more carefully
designed by considering user scheduling issue. Second, the nonlinear convex problem of Theorem 1 and Corollary
1 is generally solved by IPMs [10], [11]. One of them, we consider Primal-Dual IPM [10], [11] that has the

approximated computational complexity as O(cid:0)K 3(cid:1) if M ≪ K. Also, the optimization package such as [16] would
be useful to ﬁnd the solution. At last, let us consider the effect of a large enough M for a ﬁxed cost.
Proposition 3: For BC in (23), if cΣ → ∞ (M → ∞) for a ﬁxed r (αj , dj K), then vol(BC) → 0.
Proof: For the given expression of vol(BR) by the proof of Proposition 2, if cΣ → ∞ for a ﬁxed r, then
vol(BR) → 0. By Bishop-Gromov inequality, vol (BC) ≤ vol (BR) holds if BR and BC have the same dimension and
radius, and a deﬁned Riemannian manifold for BC has positive Ricci curvature which is guaranteed by following
the manifold deﬁnition in [17]. Then, vol(BC) → 0 holds by vol(BR) → 0.
It indicates that a large cΣ(M ) does not always beneﬁcial if r is ﬁxed, since the size of feasible space is highly
reduced, although the number of free variables is increased. Its actual effect is shown in the following section.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

Let us deﬁne complementary CDF as P [PARi ≥ PAR0] (CCDF) for i ∈ [1 : M ], and consider that |A| =
16 (QAM), N = J = dΣ = 2, αΣ = α1+α2, d1 = d2 = 1, and ζ ∈ {1.5 (1.76 dB), 1.8 (2.55 dB), 2.0 (3.00 dB)}, M ∈
{4, 8, 16}, in order to evaluate the PAR performance according to αΣ, cΣ and K, and other parameters are speciﬁed
in each ﬁgure.
Fig. 2 plots the CCDF and the CDF of PARi. In the CCDF, a lower PARi is shown in case that αΣ is smaller
under the same cΣ. Also, a lower PARi is shown in case that cΣ is larger under the same αΣ. This result would
not be deviated from our intuitions and would be predicted from [6], [7], while the CDF of Fig. 2 shows that the
variance of PARi is reduced as K increases. From the proof of Proposition 2, it would be reasonable to infer that
the volume concentration phenomenon is intensiﬁed as K increases, and the average power is hardened. With this
observation, we focus on showing the effectiveness of the scheme II based on Corollary 1.

Fig. 3 shows the CDF of ˆγ and E[ˆγ] based on Corollary 1, according to ζ, M. It is observed that most of the
empirical E[PARi] is similar to ζ, except for M = 4, ζ = 1.5. In this case, most of ˆγ samples are away from 1,
and E[PARi] = 1.77 is not relatively close to ζ = 1.5, which is due to the inaccuracy of approximation of √ˆγ
when ˆγ gets away from 1. Also, for ζ = 1.5, the variance of ˆγ for M = 8 is smaller than the variance of ˆγ for
M = 16, and E[ˆγ] for M = 8 is also greater than E[ˆγ] for M = 16. This result can be inferred from Proposition 3.
Thus, increasing cΣ needs to be considered with other parameters affecting r. As an example, the CDF is plotted
for M = 16, ζ = 1.5 with K = 256.

Fig. 4 respectively shows the CDF of ˆγ, the CCDF of PARi and the CDF of PARi for M = 4, ζ = 1.8, assuming
that the performance difference between ζ = 2.55 dB and E [PARi] = 2.79 dB is negligible. As K increases, most
of the generated PARi samples are concentrated on E [PARi] = 2.79 dB, since the variance of PARi decreases.
Thus, PARi at the CCDF = 10−3 goes closer to E [PARi]. In consideration of E [PARi] ≈ ζ, this result coincides
with Corollary 1. Thus, we can infer the similar performance trend in case with another ζ, M and other simulation
parameters from this numerical result.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The MIMO precoding scheme has been proposed for MU-MIMO OFDM system. We have shown that, on average,
the proposed scheme achieves the required PAR nearly accurate and that it can be effectively used for the required
performance speciﬁed as 0.1 percent PAR if K is large. Also, for the effective application in large-scale MIMO
systems, the parameters αj, dj and K for all j ∈ [1 : J] need to be carefully determined considering the size of
the feasible space.
