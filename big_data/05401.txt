REPRESENTATIONS OF COHOMOLOGICAL HALL ALGEBRAS

AND DONALDSON-THOMAS THEORY WITH CLASSICAL

STRUCTURE GROUPS

MATTHEW B. YOUNG

Abstract. We introduce a new class of representations of the cohomological
Hall algebras of Kontsevich and Soibelman which we call cohomological Hall
modules, or CoHM for short. These representations are constructed from self-
dual representations of a quiver with contravariant involution σ and provide a
mathematical model for the space of BPS states in orientifold string theory. We
use the CoHM to deﬁne a generalization of cohomological Donaldson-Thomas
theory of quivers which allows the quiver representations to have orthogonal
and symplectic structure groups. The associated invariants are called orien-
tifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants. We prove the integrality conjecture for
orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants of σ-symmetric quivers. We also for-
mulate precise conjectures regarding the geometric meaning of these invariants
and the freeness of the CoHM of a σ-symmetric quiver. We prove the freeness
conjecture for disjoint union quivers, loop quivers and the aﬃne Dynkin quiver
of type eA1. We also verify the geometric conjecture in number of examples.
Finally, we describe the CoHM of ﬁnite type quivers by constructing explicit
Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt type bases of these representations.

Introduction

Motivation. Motivated by the Donaldson-Thomas theory of three dimensional
Calabi-Yau categories, Kontsevich and Soibelman introduced in [28] the cohomo-
logical Hall algebra (CoHA) of a quiver with potential. We brieﬂy recall the connec-
tion between Donaldson-Thomas theory and the CoHA, leaving details to Section
2. For simplicity we assume that the potential is zero and that the quiver Q is
symmetric. Let Λ+
Q be the abelian monoid of dimension vectors of Q. Denote by
VectZ the category of Z-graded rational vector spaces and by Dlb(VectZ)Λ+
the full
subcategory of Λ+
Q-graded objects of the unbounded derived category of VectZ with
ﬁnite dimensional Λ+
Q × Z-homogeneous summands. The CoHA of Q is deﬁned to
be the shifted direct sum of cohomology groups of stacks of representations of Q,

Q

HQ = Md∈Λ+

Q

H •(Md){χ(d, d)/2} ∈ Dlb(VectZ)Λ+

Q

.

Here χ is the Euler form of Q and the Z-grading is the Hodge theoretic weight
grading. A natural correspondence of stacks makes HQ into an associative algebra
object of Dlb(VectZ)Λ+

. There exists an object V prim

Q ∈ Dlb(VectZ)Λ+

such that

Q

Q

[Sym(V prim

Q ⊗ Q[u])] = [HQ] ∈ K0(Dlb(VectZ)Λ+

Q

)

(1)

where u is an indeterminant of degree (0, 2) ∈ Λ+
Q × Z and Sym(V ) is the free
supercommutative algebra on V , the Z2-grading induced by the Z-grading. The
motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariant of Q is then deﬁned to be the class

ΩQ,d = [V prim

Q,d ] ∈ K0(Dlb(VectZ)),

d ∈ Λ+
Q.

The integrality conjecture [27] states that

ΩQ,d ∈ im(cid:0)K0(Db(VectZ)) → K0(Dlb(VectZ))(cid:1)

for each d ∈ Λ+
[28, Theorem 10]. However, positivity of ΩQ was not proved.

Q. A proof of this conjecture for quivers with potential was given in

While the deﬁnition of ΩQ involves only the graded dimensions of HQ, it is
natural to expect that understanding the algebra structure of HQ may lead to
additional insights. Not unrelated, the algebra HQ has physical signiﬁcance: it is
a model for the algebra of closed oriented BPS states of a quantum ﬁeld theory or
string theory with extended supersymmetry [21], [28]. In this direction, Eﬁmov [13]
constructed a subobject V prim
having ﬁnite dimensional
Λ+

Q-homogeneous summands, such that the canonical map

Q ⊗ Q[u] ⊂ HQ, with V prim

Q

Sym(V prim

Q ⊗ Q[u]) → HQ

(2)

is an algebra isomorphism. Passing to Grothendieck rings, this conﬁrms the inte-
grality and positivity conjectures. The subobject V prim
is a cohomologically reﬁned
Donaldson-Thomas invariant in the sense of [41]. For an arbitrary quiver with
potential W and generic stability θ, it was recently proved [8] that the slope µ
cohomological Donaldson-Thomas invariant V prim,θ
Q,W,µ can also be constructed as a
subobject of the semistable critical CoHA Hθ-ss
Q,W,µ and that the analogue of the

or better, with VectZ replaced by a

map (2) is an isomorphism in Dlb(VectZ)Λ+
more reﬁned category. Moreover, V prim,θ
way Hθ-ss
the geometric interpretation of V prim,θ
quiver moduli [32]. As an application, the structure of Hθ-ss
give a new proof of the Ka˘c conjecture.

Q,W,µ satisﬁes the integrality conjecture. In this
Q,W,µ acquires a Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt type basis. Theses results rely on
Q,W,µ in terms of the intersection cohomology of
Q,W,µ was used in [6] to

Q

The representation theory of the CoHA is also relevant to Donaldson-Thomas
theory. Physical arguments suggest that the space of open BPS states in a theory
with defects is a representation of the algebra of BPS states [19]. By the work
of [4] such representations are expected to be related to CoHA representations
constructed from stable framed objects [39]. See also [40]. In the case of quiver
categories, framed CoHA representations have been studied in detail [16], [43], [8].
A similar construction, with framed quiver moduli replaced by Nakajima quiver
varieties, was given in [44].

In this paper we introduce a new class of CoHA representations which are de-
ﬁned using orthogonal and symplectic analogues of quiver representations. While
the framing construction models open BPS states, the constructions in this paper
model (unoriented) BPS states in orientifold string theory. A less general ap-
proach to this problem, using ﬁnite ﬁeld Hall algebras and their representations,
was given in [45]. From a related point of view, our formalism provides an ex-
tension of Donaldson-Thomas theory from structure group GLn(C) to the classical
groups On(C) and Sp2n(C), in the following sense. If G is a reductive group, then
the derived moduli stack of G-bundles on a Calabi-Yau threefold X has a canon-
ical (−1)-shifted symplectic structure [33, Corollary 2.6] and its truncation has a
symmetric perfect obstruction theory [33, §3.2] which could be used to deﬁne the
G-Donaldson-Thomas invariants of X. The usual Donaldson-Thomas theory is re-
lated to the case G = GLn(C). For G an orthogonal or symplectic group, G-bundles
on X are precisely the (frame bundles of) self-dual objects of the category of vector
bundles on X. More generally, we expect that the correct setting for orientifold
Donaldson-Thomas theory is a three dimensional triangulated Calabi-Yau category
together with a contravariant duality functor which preserves the Calabi-Yau pair-
ing. The CoHA representations introduced below, and the resulting orientifold
Donaldson-Thomas invariants, provide a concrete realization of this theory in the
quiver setting.

Main results. Let Q be a quiver with contravariant involution σ. Denote by
Λσ,+
Q ⊂ Λ+
Q the submonoid of σ-invariant dimension vectors. Then Dlb(VectZ)Λσ,+
is naturally a left module category over Dlb(VectZ)Λ+
. After ﬁxing some combina-
torial data, the involution induces a contravariant duality functor on the represen-
tation category RepC(Q). Denote by Mσ
e the stack of representations of dimension
vector e ∈ Λσ,+
Q which are symmetrically isomorphic to their duals (henceforth,
self-dual representations) and set

Q

Q

MQ = Me∈Λσ,+

Q

H •(Mσ

e ){E(e)/2} ∈ Dlb(VectZ)Λσ,+

.

The function E : ΛQ → Z is the analogue of the Euler form for self-dual representa-
tions. Write Mσ
d,e for the stack of ﬂags of representations U ⊂ M with M self-dual,
U isotropic in M and dim U = d, dim M = d + σ(d) + e. In Theorem 3.1 we prove
that the correspondences

where // is a categorical version of symplectic reduction, give MQ the structure of
a left HQ-module object of Dlb(VectZ)Λσ,+
. We call MQ the cohomological Hall
module (CoHM). In Theorem 3.3 we use torus equivariant localization to prove that
MQ has an explicit combinatorial description as a signed shuﬄe module, analogous
to the Fe˘ıgin-Odesski˘ı shuﬄe algebra structure of HQ [28]. This result is crucial for
both the theoretical and computational aspects of the paper.

Q

Suppose for simplicity that Q is σ-symmetric, that is, symmetric and σ∗E = E.
Q ⊂ MQ be a minimal generating subobject with respect to the HQ-module

Let W prim
structure. Deﬁne the motivic orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariant of Q by

Ωσ

Q,e = [W prim

Q,e ] ∈ K0(Dlb(VectZ)),

e ∈ Λσ,+
Q .

Our ﬁrst main result is the following.

Theorem A (Theorem 3.4). The orientifold integrality conjecture holds for σ-
symmetric quivers. More precisely, for each e ∈ Λσ,+

Q we have

Ωσ

Q,e ∈ im(cid:0)K0(Db(VectZ)) ֒→ K0(Dlb(VectZ))(cid:1).

The proof is based on Eﬁmov’s proof [13] of the integrality conjecture for HQ
and relies on the explicit signed shuﬄe description of MQ. Note that positivity of
orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants follows immediately from their deﬁnition.
Q and its relationship with the ordinary invariant ΩQ we
then study the analogue of the map (2). The situation is more complicated than
that of the CoHA since MQ is not a free HQ-module. Instead, we formulate the
following conjecture.

To better understand Ωσ

Conjecture A (Conjecture 3.7). Let Q be σ-symmetric and assume that HQ is
supercommutative. Then for each e ∈ Λσ,+
Q × Z-graded subalgebra
HQ(e) ⊂ HQ such that the CoHA action map

Q there is a Λσ,+

HQ(e) ⊠ W prim

Q

Q,e is a HQ(e)-module isomorphism onto its image.

. Moreover, the restriction to the summand

Roughly speaking, HQ(e) is the free supercommutative algebra on the pure coho-
mology of an e-dependent Z2-quotient of the stack of stable quiver representations.
Passing to Grothendieck rings, Conjecture A implies the following orientifold ana-
logue of the factorization (1):

Xe∈Λσ,+

Q

[HQ(e)] · Ωσ

Q,e = [MQ].

In general, the invariant ΩQ does not have enough information to determine [HQ(e)]
and hence Ωσ
Q cannot be computed directly from ΩQ. Instead, a Z2-equivariantly
reﬁned version of ΩQ is needed.

We also describe a conjectural geometric interpretation of orientifold Donaldson-
Thomas invariants. Let Mσ,st
be the moduli scheme of stable self-dual representa-
tions of dimension vector e and let P H •(Mσ,st
) be the pure part of its cohomol-
ogy. In Proposition 3.9 we construct a canonical surjection of graded vector spaces

The analogue of Conjecture B for Donaldson-Thomas invariants was proved by

Chen [3].

In Sections 4 and 5 we conﬁrm Conjectures A and B in a number of examples.
The main results of Section 4, which focuses on the CoHM of σ-symmetric quivers,
are be summarized by the following two theorems.

Theorem B (Theorem 4.6). Conjecture A holds if Q is the m-loop quiver.

When the number of loops is zero or one, the CoHM can be explicitly de-
scribed and Ωσ
Q can be computed in closed form, allowing Conjecture B to be
veriﬁed. In contrast to the ordinary case, there are already inﬁnitely many orien-
tifold Donaldson-Thomas invariants in some of these examples. For arbitrary loops
Theorem B can be used to compute Ωσ
Q from ΩQ using a computer algebra system.

Theorem C (Theorems 4.2 and 4.9). Conjectures A and B hold for disjoint union

quivers and for the symmetric orientation of the aﬃne Dynkin quiver of type eA1.

In each of the above examples we compute all orientifold Donaldson-Thomas

invariants and describe explicitly the module structure of MQ.

In Section 5 we study the CoHM of ﬁnite type quivers with involution. Except
in trivial cases, ﬁnite type quivers are not σ-symmetric and their CoHM have a
rather diﬀerent than Conjecture A. The non-trivial task is to describe the CoHM
of Dynkin type A quivers.

Theorem D (Theorem 5.8). Let Q be a type A Dynkin quiver. Then MQ ad-
mits two Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt type bases, each of which is determined by a sim-
ple/indecomposable Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt type basis of HQ and the set of sim-
ple/indecomposable self-dual representations of Q.

Theorem D generalizes and categoriﬁes the orientifold quantum dilogarithm iden-
tities found in [45] using ﬁnite ﬁeld methods. The Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt type bases
are a reﬂection of the Harder-Narasimhan factorization at the level of the CoHM,
something we expect to hold quite generally; see Section 3.5. To prove Theorem D
we modify Rim´anyi’s approach to the study of the CoHA of a ﬁnite type quiver [37].
Along the way we prove a number of results that are of independent interest. For
example, Corollary 5.6 states that Thom polynomials of orbit closures of self-dual
quiver representations appear as structure constants of the CoHM.

In this paper we have made calculations only in the case of zero potential; see
however Section 3.5 for the construction of the critical CoHM. There are also a
number of expected applications which we have not discussed. Perhaps the most
exciting is the connection between the CoHA and the cohomology of GLn(C) char-
acter varieties [7]. It is natural to expect a connection between the corresponding
CoHM and character varieties for On(C) and Sp2n(C).

Notation. All cohomology groups have coeﬃcient ring Q and, unless explicitly
stated otherwise, all tensor products are over Q.

1.1. Classical groups. We ﬁx notation regarding the classical groups. Each such
group Gn is the automorphism group of a pair (Vn, h·, ·i) consisting of a ﬁnite
dimensional complex vector space with nondegenerate bilinear form.

(1) Types Bn and Dn. Let Vn = C2n+1 with basis x1, . . . , xn, w, y1, . . . , yn in
type Bn and Vn = C2n with basis x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn in type Dn. Deﬁne a
symmetric bilinear form on Vn by hxi, yji = δi,j, and hw, wi = 1 in type Bn,
all other pairings being zero. Then Gn is the orthogonal group O2n+1(C)
or O2n(C). It is important in what follows that we use the full orthogonal
group and not the special orthogonal group.

(2) Type Cn. Let Vn = C2n with basis x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn and skew-symmetric
bilinear form determined by hxi, yji = δi,j . Then Gn is the symplectic group
Sp2n(C).

Deﬁne a maximal torus by

Tn = {diag(t1, . . . , tn, (1), t−1

1 , . . . , t−1

n ) | ti ∈ C×} ⊂ Gn,

omitting the middle 1 except in type Bn. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ n we have a character
ei : Tn → C×, t 7→ ti. Then the positive roots are

Type Bn : ∆ = {ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} ⊔ {ei | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
Type Cn : ∆ = {ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n} ⊔ {2ei | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}
Type Dn : ∆ = {ei ± ej | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n}.

The Weyl groups WGn = NGn (Tn)/Tn are

WO2n+1 ≃ (Zn

2 ⋊ Sn) × Z2,

WSp2n ≃ Zn

2 ⋊ Sn,

WO2n ≃ Zn

2 ⋊ Sn

where Sn is the symmetric group on n letters. Note that WOn is an extension of
WSOn by Z2 ≃ π0(On(C)).

1.2. Quiver representations. Let Q be a quiver with ﬁnite sets of nodes Q0 and
arrows Q1. Write α : i → j for an arrow α with tail i and head j. Let RepC(Q) be
the hereditary abelian category of ﬁnite dimensional complex representations of Q.
Ui

Objects of RepC(Q) are pairs (U, u), often denoted by just U , where U =Li∈Q0

uα−−→ Uj}

is a ﬁnite dimensional Q0-graded complex vector space and u = {Ui
is a collection of linear maps. Let Λ+
vectors. Set also ΛQ = ZQ0. We write dim U ∈ Λ+

α−→j∈Q1
i
Q = Z≥0Q0 be the abelian monoid of dimension
Q for the dimension vector of U .

The Euler form of RepC(Q) is

χ(U, V ) = dimC Hom(U, V ) − dimC Ext1(U, V ).

It descends to a bilinear form on ΛQ which has the explicit expression

χ(d, d′) = Xi∈Q0

1.3. Self-dual quiver representations. For a detailed discussion of self-dual
quiver representations the reader is referred to [10].

An involution σ of a quiver Q is a pair of involutions σ : Q0 → Q0 and σ : Q1 →

Q1 such that

(i) if i α−→ j ∈ Q1, then σ(j)
(ii) if i α−→ σ(i) ∈ Q1, then α = σ(α).

Q = Λ+
Q ∩ Λσ
H : ΛQ → Λσ
Q,

Q. The group homomorphism

d 7→ d + σ(d)

makes Λσ

Q into a ΛQ-module.

A duality structure on (Q, σ) is a pair of functions s : Q0 → {±1} and τ : Q1 →
{±1} such that s is σ-invariant and τατσ(α) = sisj for every arrow i α−→ j. Each
duality structure deﬁnes an exact contravariant functor S : RepC(Q) → RepC(Q) as
follows. At the level of objects, S is given by

S(U )i = U ∨

σ(i),

S(u)α = ταu∨

σ(α).

Here (−)∨ = HomC(−, C) is the linear duality functor on the category of ﬁnite
dimensional complex vector spaces. If φ : U → U ′ is a morphism with components
φi, then S(φ) : S(U ′) → S(U ) has components S(φ)i = φ∨
σ(i). Let evV : V → V ∨∨
be the canonical evaluation isomorphism. Then ΘU = ⊕i∈Q0 si · evUi deﬁnes an
∼−→ S2 which satisﬁes S(ΘU )ΘS(U) = 1S(U).
isomorphism of functors Θ : 1Rep(Q)
The triple (RepC(Q), S, Θ) is therefore an abelian category with duality in the sense
of [1].

A self-dual representation is a pair (M, ψM ) consisting of a representation M
∼
and an isomorphism ψM : M
−→ S(M ) which satisﬁes S(ψM )ΘM = ψM . More
geometrically, a self-dual representation is a representation M together with a non-
degenerate bilinear form h·, ·i such that

(i) Mi and Mj are orthogonal unless i = σ(j),
(ii) the restriction of h·, ·i to Mi + Mσ(i) satisﬁes hx, x′i = sihx′, xi, and
(iii) for each arrow i α−→ j the structure maps of M satisfy

hmαx, x′i − ταhx, mσ(α)x′i = 0,

x ∈ Mi, x′ ∈ Mσ(j).

Let U ∈ RepC(Q). The pair (S, ΘU ) deﬁnes a linear action of Z2 on Exti(S(U ), U ).

Write Exti(S(U ), U )±S for the subspace of (anti-)invariants and deﬁne

E(U ) = dimC Hom(S(U ), U )−S − dimC Ext1(S(U ), U )S.

It was proved in [46, Proposition 3.3] that E(U ) depends only on the dimension
vector of U and that the resulting function E : ΛQ → Z is

We will also use the identity

d, d′ ∈ ΛQ.

(5)

Self-dual representations admit reductions along isotropic subrepresentations.
More precisely, if M is a self-dual representation with isotropic subrepresentation
U , then the orthogonal complement U ⊥ ⊂ M is a subrepresentation which contains
U and the quotient M//U = U ⊥/U inherits a canonical self-dual structure.
Following [27], to a quiver Q we associate the quantum torus ˆTQ = Q(q

Finally, we recall how the standard theory of stability of quiver representations
[26] can be adapted to the self-dual setting. For details see [45, §3]. A stability
θ ∈ HomZ(ΛQ, Z) is called σ-compatible if it satisﬁes σ∗θ = −θ. Fix a σ-compatible
stability θ. A self-dual representation M is called σ-semistable if µ(U ) ≤ µ(M ) for
all non-zero isotropic subrepresentations U ⊂ M . If the previous inequality is strict,
then M is called σ-stable. Here µ(U ) = θ(dim U)
is the slope of U . Note that the
slope of a self-dual representation is necessarily zero.

The moduli scheme of σ-semistable self-dual representations of dimension vector
e is the θ-linearized geometric invariant theory quotient Mσ,θ
e . It pa-
rameterizes S-equivalence classes of σ-semistable representations. There is an open
subvariety Mσ,θ-st
e which parameterizes isometry classes of σ-stable repre-
sentations. In general, Mσ,θ-st
is an orbifold. A σ-stable representation can be writ-
e
i=1 Mi where the Mi are pairwise
non-isometric self-dual representations which are stable as ordinary representations
[45, Proposition 3.5]. In this case the isometry group of M is AutS(M ) ≃ Zk

k = 1, then M is called regularly σ-stable and it deﬁnes a smooth point of Mσ,θ-st

1.4. Equivariant cohomology. Fix an integer n > 0. If N > n, then the variety
Mat∗
N ×n of complex N × n matrices of rank n is 2(N − n)-connected and carries
a free action of GLn. The quotients Mat∗
N ×n/GLn form an injective
system {EN → BN }N >n of ﬁnite dimensional approximations by varieties to the
universal GLn-bundle EGLn → BGLn. More generally, if G is a linear algebraic
group with a closed embedding G ֒→ GLn, then {EN → EN /G}N >n approximates
EG → BG. If H ⊂ G is a closed subgroup, then the canonical morphism BH → BG
is a ﬁbration with ﬁbre G/H.

N ×n → Mat∗

Suppose that G acts on a variety X. Then the G-equivariant cohomology of X

is deﬁned to be

H •

G(X) = lim
←−

H •(X ×G EN ; Q).

Here H •(−; Q) denotes singular cohomology with rational coeﬃcients. We write

G for H •

H •

GLn ≃ H •(BTGLn)WGLn ≃ Q[x1, . . . , xn]Sn .

Similarly, if Gn is a classical group of type Bn, Cn or Dn, then the inclusion
Tn ֒→ Gn induces ring isomorphisms

H •

Gn ≃ H •(BTn)WGn ≃ Q[z2

1, . . . , z2

(6)

Here it is essential that Gn is the full orthogonal group in type Dn. The generators
xi, zi have cohomological degree two.

We record the following results for later use.

Lemma 1.1.

(1) Let φ : GLn → GLn be the automorphism φ(g) = (g−1)t. The induced map

(Bφ)∗ : H •

GLn

→ H •

GLn

is (Bφ)∗f (x1, . . . , xn) = f (−x1, . . . , −xn).

(2) Let h : GLn ֒→ Gn be the hyperbolic embedding. The induced map (Bh)∗ :

H •
Gn

→ H •

GLn

is given by (Bh)∗zi = xi.

(3) Let ι : Gn ֒→ GL2n+ǫ be the embedding arising from the description of Gn
given in Section 1.1, where ǫ = 1 in type Bn and ǫ = 0 otherwise. Under
the identiﬁcation H •
≃ Q[x1, . . . , xn, (w), y1, . . . , yn]S2n+ǫ the induced
map (Bι)∗ : H •

is given by

GL2n+ǫ

GL2n+ǫ
(Bι)∗xi = zi,

→ H •
Gn
(Bι)∗w = 0,

(Bι)∗yi = −zi.

Proof. The statements can be proved by picking compatible maximal tori for the
domain and codomain of each homomorphism.
(cid:3)

Finally, recall that H •

G(X) (and its compactly supported variant H •

c,G(X)) has a

canonical mixed Hodge structure [9]. The pure part of H •

G(X) is deﬁned to be

2. Cohomological Hall algebras

2.1. Deﬁnition of the CoHA. We recall some material from [28, §2].

Fix a quiver Q. Let VectZ be the abelian category of ﬁnite dimensional Z-graded
rational vector spaces and let Dlb(VectZ) ⊂ D(VectZ) be the full subcategory of
objects whose cohomological and Z degrees are bounded from below. Let also

Let d′, d′′ ∈ Λ+

Q and put d = d′ + d′′. Write Cd′

spanned by the ﬁrst d′ coordinate directions. Let Rd′,d′′ ⊂ Rd be the subspace of
representations which preserve Cd′
and let GLd′,d′′ ⊂ GLd be the subgroup which
preserves Cd′

. The cohomological Hall algebra (henceforth CoHA) of Q is

HQ = Md∈Λ+

Q

H •

GLd (Rd){χ(d, d)/2} ∈ Dlb(VectZ)Λ+

.

The Z-grading is the Hodge theoretic weight grading, which by purity coincides
with the cohomological degree. A multiplication HQ ⊠tw HQ → HQ is deﬁned so
that its restriction to HQ,d′ ⊠tw HQ,d′′ is the composition

H •

GLd′ (Rd′ ) ⊗ H •

H •

GLd′,d′′ (Rd′,d′′) → H •

GLd′,d′′ (Rd){(2∆1)/2} → H •

GLd (Rd){(2∆1 + 2∆2)/2}.

For ease of notation the degree shifts in HQ and ⊠tw have been omitted. The maps
in the composition are constructed from the obvious morphisms

Rd′ × Rd′′

π

i
֒→ Rd,

GLd′ × GLd′′

p

(7)

The ﬁrst map in the CoHA multiplication is the K¨unneth map, the second is induced
by the homotopy equivalences π and p, the third is pushforward along the GLd′,d′′-
equivariant closed inclusion i and the ﬁnal is pushforward along GLd/GLd′,d′′ , the
ﬁbre of BGLd′,d′′ → BGLd. The degree shift is ∆1 + ∆2 = −χ(d′, d′′). It is shown
in [28, Theorem 1] that this multiplication gives HQ the structure of an associative
algebra object of Dlb(VectZ)Λ+

.

Q

The CoHA product can be written explicitly using localization in equivari-
ant cohomology. To do so, identify HQ,d with the vector space of polynomials
in the variables {xi,1, . . . , xi,di}i∈Q0 which are invariant under the Weyl group
Sdi of GLd. The product of f1 ∈ HQ,d′ and f2 ∈ HQ,d′′ will be
i,k with xi,k
i+k, respectively. Let shd′,d′′ ⊂ Sd be the set of 2-shuﬄes of type (d′, d′′),

viewed as a polynomial in {xi,1, . . . , xi,di }i∈Q0 by identifying x′
and xi,d′
that is, the set of elements {πi}i∈Q0 ∈ Sd which satisfy

Sd = Qi∈Q0

i,k and x′′

πi(1) < · · · < πi(d′

i),

πi(d′

i + 1) < · · · < πi(di),

i ∈ Q0.

Then shd′,d′′ acts on polynomials in {xi,1, . . . , xi,di}i∈Q0 via the action of Sd.

Theorem 2.1 ([28, Theorem 2]). The product of f1 ∈ HQ,d′ and f2 ∈ HQ,d′′ is

The series AQ is naturally viewed as an element of the quantum torus ˆTQ since
the product in the latter agrees with the product induced by ⊠tw. Passing from
motivic DT series to motivic DT invariants is most easily explained in the case of
symmetric quivers. We do this in the next section.

2.2. The CoHA of a symmetric quiver. Throughout this section we assume
that Q is symmetric, that is, that the Euler form of Q is a symmetric bilinear form.
In this case ⊠tw reduces to a symmetric monoidal product ⊠ on Dlb(VectZ)Λ+
and
HQ is a Λ+

Q × Z-graded algebra.

Q

Deﬁne a Z2-grading on HQ as the reduction modulo two of its Z-grading. If the

Euler form satisﬁes

χ(d, d′) ≡ χ(d, d)χ(d′, d′) mod 2

(8)
Q, then HQ is supercommutative. Explicitly, writing aij for the

for all d, d′ ∈ Λ+
number of arrows from i to j, equation (8) holds if and only if

aij ≡ (1 + aii)(1 + ajj ) mod 2

for all distinct i, j ∈ Q0. If the Euler form does not satisfy equation (8), then the
CoHA multiplication can be twisted by a sign so as to make HQ supercommutative
[28, §2.6]. Since all (connected) symmetric quivers studied in this paper satisfy
equation (8), we do not recall this twist here.

Write Sym(V ) for the free supercommutative algebra generated by a Λ+

Q × Z-
graded vector space V . The following result was conjectured by Kontsevich and
Soibelman [28, Conjecture 1].

Theorem 2.2 ([13, Theorem 1.1]). Let Q be a symmetric quiver and let u be a
formal variable of degree (0, 2). Then there exists a Λ+
Q × Z-graded rational vector
space of the form VQ = V prim
Q ⊗ Q[u] such that, with its supercommutative structure,
Sym(VQ) ≃ HQ. Moreover, each Λ+

Since Q is symmetric, the parity-twisted Hilbert-Poincar´e series of HQ coincides

Proof. The commutative diagram used to prove associativity of the CoHA multipli-
cation in [28, §2.3] has a natural modiﬁcation in the self-dual setting, obtained by
requiring that the structure maps and isometry groups preserve multi-step isotropic
ﬂags. This modiﬁed commutative diagram establishes the HQ-module structure of
MQ.

Remark. There are versions of HQ and MQ deﬁned using cohomology with integer
coeﬃcients. However, most of the results of this paper require rational coeﬃcients.

of a b-dimensional orthogonal (s = 1) or symplectic (s = −1) vector space. The
T-ﬁxed points of Fl(di, ei, dσ(i)) are two-step coordinate ﬂags and can be labelled
by disjoint pairs of increasing sequences in {1, . . . , di + ei + dσ(i)} of the form

Such pairs are in bijection with shdi,ei,dσ(i) . The character of the tangent space to

3.3. The CoHM of a σ-symmetric quiver. We recalled in Section 2.2 the rel-
atively simple structure of the CoHA of a symmetric quiver. In general, we do not
know if the supercommutative twist of the CoHA multiplication can be lifted to
MQ. In this section we therefore consider HQ with its standard multiplication.

In the self-dual setting it is natural to impose on Q the following stronger notion

of symmetry.

Deﬁnition. A quiver with involution and duality structure is called σ-symmetric
if it is symmetric and the equality E(d) = E(σ(d)) holds for all d ∈ ΛQ.

Concretely, using equation (4) we see that a symmetric quiver is σ-symmetric if

and only if

If Q is σ-symmetric, then ⊠S-tw reduces to the Dlb(VectZ)Λ+

of Dlb(VectZ)Λσ,+
Q. Somewhat
abusively, we denote this module structure by ⊠. In particular, the CoHM of a
σ-symmetric quiver is a Λσ,+

Q × Z-graded HQ-module.

Let HQ,+ be the augmentation ideal of HQ.

Deﬁnition. The cohomological orientifold Donaldson-Thomas invariant of a σ-

By picking a vector space splitting we will often view W prim

f (x′)g(z′′)Kσ

d′,e′′ (x′, z′′),

f ∈ XQ,d′, g ∈ ZQ,e′′ .

For the reverse inclusion, suppose that we are given an element of the form f gKσ
d′,e′′ .
By symmetrizing with respect to Sd′ and We′′ , both of which are subgroups of We,
we may assume that f ∈ HQ,d′ and g ∈ MQ,e′′ . Then, up to a non-zero constant,
the We-symmetrization of f gKσ

d′,e′′ is f ⋆ g.

To prove the theorem it therefore suﬃces to show that LWe

Q,e ⊂ MQ,e has ﬁnite
codimension. Adding a loop at each node, with duality structure τ = −1 for
nodes in Qσ
0 , does not increase LQ,e and by doing so we can avoid localizing ZQ,e.
Then MQ,e/LWe
Q,e ֒→ ZQ,e/LQ,e and it suﬃces to show that LQ,e ⊂ ZQ,e has ﬁnite

0 use the symmetric
group at i to split any ± tuples, that is tuples (a, · · · , a, −a, · · · , −a) for some a ∈ Q,
so that (a, · · · , a) lies in the x′
σ(i) variable.
Then (i) holds. Similarly, for each i ∈ Qσ
0 act by the sign change subgroup at i
to ensure that x′
i contains no ± tuples. Then (ii) holds. Condition (iii) now also
holds. Condition (iv) breaks into three cases:

We now turn to a more detailed study of MQ. Our goal is to formulate an
analogue for MQ of the freeness of the CoHA of a symmetric quiver. To begin,
note that a duality structure on an arbitrary quiver induces linear isomorphisms
Rd → Rσ(d) which are equivariant with respect to the group isomorphisms

GLd → GLσ(d),

{gi}i∈Q0 7→ {(g−1

σ(i))t}i∈Q0.

Since the functor S : RepC(Q) → RepC(Q) is contravariant, these maps deﬁne an
algebra anti-involution SH : HQ → HQ. Explicitly, using the ﬁrst part of Lemma
1.1 we ﬁnd

SH(f )({xi,j }i∈Q0, 1≤j≤dσ(i) ) = f ({˜xi,j}i∈Q0, 1≤j≤di)|˜xi,j =−xσ(i),j

(12)

for f ∈ HQ,d.

Proposition 3.5. Let Q be a σ-symmetric quiver. For all f ∈ HQ,d and g ∈ MQ,e
the equality SH(f ) ⋆ g = (−1)χ(e,d)+E(d)f ⋆ g holds.

Proof. Let ̟ ∈ shσ

d,e be the signed shuﬄe deﬁned by the maps of ordered sets

Here [n] = {z1, . . . , zn}. Precomposition with ̟ deﬁnes a bijection shσ

Moreover, equation (12) shows that, after identifying variables as in Section 3.2,
the polynomials f and SH(f ) diﬀer exactly by ̟. Note also that ̟ ﬁxes g.

σ(d),e → shσ

Using the explicit form of Kσ

d,e from Theorem 3.3, we will show that

̟(Kσ

σ(d),e) = (−1)χ(e,d)+E(d)Kσ

Applying ̟ to a factor Di of Kσ

the corresponding subalgebra of HQ. In this case, Proposition 3.5 implies that the

Q × Z-graded subalgebra

Lemma 3.6. Let Q be σ-symmetric and assume that HQ is supercommutative.
Deﬁne a Z2-grading on MQ by the reduction modulo two of its Z-grading. Then
MQ is a super HQ-module.

Proof. Observe that for an arbitrary quiver with involution the equality

χ(d, d′) = χ(σ(d′), σ(d)),

d, d′ ∈ ΛQ

DT THEORY WITH CLASSICAL STRUCTURE GROUPS

holds.
E(H(d) + e). Modulo two, we compute

In the σ-symmetric case, the parity of elements of HQ,(d,k) ⋆ MQ,(e,l) is

E(H(d) + e) ≡ E(d) + E(σ(d)) + χ(d, d) + E(e) + χ(d, e) + χ(σ(d), e)

≡ E(d) + E(σ(d)) + χ(d, d) + E(e) + χ(d, e) + χ(d, e)

≡ E(d) + E(σ(d)) + χ(d, d) + E(e)
≡ χ(d, d) + E(e).

The ﬁrst equality follows from equation (5), the second from equation (14), the
third from symmetry of Q and the last from σ-symmetry of Q. Since χ(d, d) + E(e)
is the sum of the parities of HQ,(d,k) and MQ,(e,l), the lemma follows.
(cid:3)

We can now state the main conjecture regarding the structure of MQ.

The proof of injectivity in Theorem 2.4 relies on an interpretation of ΩQ in

if the proof from [3] can be adapted to the present setting. In any case, it is natural
to make the following conjecture.

the CoHM in the presence of a stability and a potential.

d′,d′′ = Rd′,d′′ ∩ Rθ-ss

Fix a stability θ and a potential W ∈ CQ/[CQ, CQ]. Let d′, d′′ ∈ Λ+

Q and
set d = d′ + d′′. Let Rθ-ss
d ⊂ Rd be the subvariety of semistable representations
and deﬁne Rθ-ss
. There are canonically deﬁned trace functions
tr(W )d : Rθ-ss
d′,d′′ → C which are invariant under GLd
and GLd′,d′′, respectively. Recall that the full subcategory of RepC(Q) consisting of
the zero object and all semistable representations of a ﬁxed slope is abelian. Using
this fact, if µ(d′) = µ(d′′), then by restricting the maps (7) we get

Proof. We use the following simple result. Let U ⊂ N be an isotropic subrepresen-

Then N is also σ-semistable. Indeed, in this situation we obtain a pair of short
exact sequences in RepC(Q),

0 → U → U ⊥ → N//U → 0,

0 → U ⊥ → N → S(U ) → 0.

Since N//U is σ-semistable, it is semistable [45, Proposition 3.2]. The short exact
sequences now imply that U ⊥ and N are semistable of slope zero. Then N is also
σ-semistable.

Using this, for each d ∈ Λ+

This should be compared with the fact that DT invariants of symmetric quivers are
independent of stability.

To end this section we describe the expected general structure of MQ,W .

In
Sections 4 and 5 we conﬁrm these expectations in a number of examples with W = 0.
Let (Q, W ) be an arbitrary quiver with potential and generic stability θ. Motivated
by the existence and uniqueness of Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltrations, in [28, §5.2] (see
also [4, §8.1]) it was asked if there exist algebra embeddings Hθ-ss
Q,W,µ ֒→ HQ,W such
that the slope ordered CoHA multiplication

are ordered from left to right by decreasing slope. Moreover, each factor Hθ-ss
Q,W,µ is
conjectured to be the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie superalgebra structure on
V prim,θ
Q,W,µ ⊗ Q[u] whose deﬁnition involves only the stack of semistable representations
of slope µ. In this way HQ,W obtains a Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt (PBW) type basis.
See [8] for results in this direction. Conjecturally, V prim,θ
Q,W can be interpreted as the
space of closed oriented single-particle BPS states.

Consider now the orientifold setting. Each self-dual representation M has a

unique isotropic ﬁltration (the σ-Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltration)

tw

such that U1/U0, . . . , Ur/Ur−1 are semistable with strictly decreasing positive slopes
and M//Ur is zero or σ-semistable [45, Proposition 3.3]. It is therefore natural to
ask for a Hθ-ss

Let Q⊔ be the quiver Q ⊔ Qop. It has a canonical involution σ which swaps the

these identiﬁcations we ﬁnd that (f1 ⊗ f3) ⋆ f2 is equal to f1 · f2 · f3. That the
isomorphism MQ⊔

∼−→ HQ respects the gradings follows from the equality

EQ⊔(U1 ⊕ S(U2)) = χQ(U2, U1),

holding for all U1, U2 ∈ RepC(Q).

Corollary 4.3. Conjectures 3.7 and 3.10 hold for Q⊔.

(19)

(cid:3)

Proof. Equation (19) implies that Q⊔ is σ-symmetric if and only if Q is symmetric.
So assume that Q is symmetric and consider HQ with its twisted supercommutative
product. Theorems 2.2 and 4.2 give algebra isomorphisms
Q ⊕ SH(V prim

HQ⊔ ≃ HQ ⊗ Hop

Q ≃ Sym(cid:0)(cid:0)V prim

Lift the supercommutative twist of HQ by taking MQ⊔ to be the regular super

the subalgebra of HQ⊔ generated by the image of

VQ ֒→ VQ ⊕ SH(VQ) ≃(cid:0)V prim

Hence Conjecture 3.7 holds. Since Q⊔ has no σ-stable representations, Conjecture
3.10 also holds.

Remark. Theorem 4.2 and its proof generalize to the critical semistable CoHM.

Similarly, MQ⊔ is a rank one free module over HQ ⊂ HQ⊔ . This module struc-
ture is the PBW type factorization (18) associated to a σ-compatible stability on
Q⊔ whose restriction to Λ+

Proof. The map i 7→ i−1

odd partitions of length d and the set of strictly decreasing partitions of length d.
Since the Schur functions ˜si′−δd parameterized by the former set are an additive
basis of MB
L0,2d+1, the ﬁrst statement follows. In type D use instead the bijection
i 7→ i

Here Symme×e is the variety of symmetric e × e matrices and ∆ is the big diag-

1. Theorem 4.9 shows that (1 − q− 1
2 ξ(1,1))−1 is a coeﬃcient-wise upper bound for

degree of elements of HQ,d ⋆ MQ,e is at least

Q = 1 if τ = −1 and

−2E(d) = (d1 − d2)2 + d1 + d2 > 0.

It follows that 1σ
(e,e), e ≥ 0, must be included as generators of MQ. Hence
the orientifold DT invariants are as stated. To verify Conjecture 3.10 we must
prove that P H •(Mσ,st
(e,e)) ≃ Q(0). Note that we use the trivial stability. Then
Mσ,st

these are the only regularly σ-stable self-dual representations.

and only if it is a disjoint union of quivers whose underlying graphs are Dynkin
diagrams of ADE type. The only connected ﬁnite type quivers with involution are
of type A; all other ﬁnite type quivers with involution are disjoint unions of these
and quivers of the form ADE⊔. By Theorem 4.2 the CoHM of a ADE⊔ quiver
reduces to the CoHA of a ADE quiver, whose structure we recall in Section 5.1.
The main task is therefore to describe the CoHM of a type A Dynkin quiver.

5.1. Finite type CoHA. Let Q be a connected ﬁnite type quiver. For simplicity
we assume that Q is not of type E8; for this case see [37, Remark 11.3]. The
sets Π ⊂ ∆ of positive simple and positive roots of Q are in bijection with the
sets of isomorphism classes of simple and indecomposable representations of Q,
respectively [17]. Identify ∆ with a subset of Λ+
Q using the dimension vector map
and write Iβ for the indecomposable representation of dimension vector β ∈ ∆. Fix
a total order β1 < · · · < βN on ∆ such that Hom(Iβi , Iβj ) = 0 = Ext1(Iβj , Iβi) if
i < j. Such an order exists because the Auslander-Reiten quiver ΓQ is acyclic.

For each β ∈ ∆ consider the direct sums

5.2. Preliminary results for the self-dual case. Let (Q, σ) be of Dynkin type
A. Then Q has two inequivalent duality structures, say τ = −1 and s = 1 or τ = −1
and s = −1, giving orthogonal or symplectic representations in the language of [10].
In type A2n (respectively, A2n+1) all orthogonal (symplectic) representations are
hyperbolic. In the remaining two cases, henceforth referred to as non-hyperbolic,
each σ-invariant positive root admits a unique self-dual structure.

To describe MQ we will modify Rim´anyi’s approach to the study of HQ. Fix
d•,e∞ ⊂

i=1 H(di) + e∞. Let Gσ

Q)r, e∞ ∈ Λσ,+

e be the stabilizer of a Q0-graded isotropic ﬂag of Ce of the form

d• = (d1, . . . , dr) ∈ (Λ+
Gσ

Q and put e =Pr

0 = U0 ⊂ U1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Ur ⊂ Ce,

dim Uk/Uk−1 = dk, dim Ce//Ur = e∞.

e /Gσ

d•,e∞ ≃ Gσ

Let Flσ
be extended to a ﬂag of length 2r + 1 by setting U2r−k+1 = U ⊥

d•,e∞ be the corresponding isotropic ﬂag variety. Each U• can

k for k = 0, . . . , r.

For k = 1, . . . , 2r + 1 let Vi,k be the tautological vector bundle over Flσ

d•,e∞
parameterizing the kth subspace of Ce at i. The quotient bundle Fi,k = Vi,k/Vi,k−1
has rank dk
σ(i),2r+1−k.
By duality this gives a chain of vector bundle isomorphisms

i . The bilinear form on Ce induces isomorphisms Fi,k ≃ F ∨

Hom(Fi,k, Fj,l) ≃ Hom(F ∨
which induce a linear Z2-action on

j,l, F ∨

G = Mi

α−→j∈Q1 M1≤k<l≤2r+1

Denote by Gσ the subbundle of anti-ﬁxed points.

The following result is motivated by [37, Lemmas 8.1 and 8.2].

Lemma 5.2. Let fk ∈ HQ,dk , k = 1, . . . , r, and g ∈ MQ,e∞ . Then

computed by localization with respect to Te ⊂ Gσ
e . The Te-ﬁxed points are those
appearing in the proof of (the r-fold iteration of) Theorem 3.3. Since the weights of

The duality structure on RepC(Q) deﬁnes an involution of the Auslander-Reiten
quiver ΓQ, sending an indecomposable representation I to S(I). This involution
preserves the levels of ΓQ which, being in type A, are exactly the orbits of the
Auslander-Reiten translation. Fix a partition ∆ = ∆− ⊔ ∆σ ⊔ ∆+ such that ∆σ is

DT THEORY WITH CLASSICAL STRUCTURE GROUPS

ﬁxed pointwise by S and S(∆−) = ∆+. Then, without loss of generality, we can
assume that βu < S(βu) for all βu ∈ ∆−. Write ∆− = {βu1 < · · · < βur }.

Lemma 5.4. Every self-dual representation M has a unique isotropic ﬁltration

0 = U0 ⊂ U1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Ur ⊂ M

such that Uj/Uj−1 ≃ I

⊕muj
βuj

, j = 1, . . . , r, and M//Ur ≃Lβu∈∆σ I ⊕mu

Proof. Any self-dual representation can be written uniquely as an orthogonal direct
sum of indecomposable self-dual representations. Explicitly, we have

M =

gives a ﬁltration with the desired properties.

Setting Uj =Lj

Suppose that U ′

• ⊂ M is another ﬁltration with the stated properties. By a
standard argument the assumption βu1 < · · · < βur implies U ′
• = U•. So it suﬃces
to show that there is a unique isotropic embedding Ur ֒→ M . To do so, ﬁrst note
that Hom(Iβ , Iβ′) = 0 for all β ∈ ∆− and β′ ∈ ∆σ. Indeed, if Hom(Iβ, Iβ′ ) 6= 0,
then Hom(Iβ′ , S(Iβ)) 6= 0. Hence β > β′ and β′ > S(β) so that β > S(β), a
contradiction. It follows that the summand U1 ⊂ Ur must map isomorphically onto
I ⊕m1
), this would
β1
contradict the condition that U2 be isotropic. Hence U2 must map isomorphically
. Continuing in this way we see that Ur ֒→ M is the canonical
onto I
isotropic embedding.

We derive two results using Lemma 5.4. The ﬁrst is a self-dual extension of
a theorem of Reineke [35, Theorem 2.2] and appears in the unpublished thesis of
Lovett [29]. For M ∈ Rσ
e -orbit closure

Theorem 5.5 ([29]). Let M be a self-dual representation.

Lemma 5.4, set dj = mjβj, j = 1, . . . , r, and e∞ = dim M//Ur. Then the canonical
morphism πσ

e -equivariant resolution of ησ

M : Σσ → Rσ

e is a Gσ

Proof. This is proved for Q of type A3 in [30, Proposition 2.3]. For the general case
we use a self-dual version of Reineke’s resolution.

The variety Σσ is smooth and the morphism πσ

M is proper and equivariant. We

prove that πσ

M (Σσ) = ησ

M . If N ∈ πσ

M (Σσ), then there is an isotropic ﬁltration

0 = V0 ⊂ V1 ⊂ · · · ⊂ Vr ⊂ N,

dim Vj /Vj−1 = dj .

⊕muj

Since Ext1(Iβ , Iβ) = 0 for all β ∈ ∆, Voigt’s lemma implies that Vj /Vj−1 is a

degeneration of I
is a degeneration of ⊕βu∈∆σ I ⊕mu
. Applying [35, Lemma 2.3] we conclude that
βu
N is a degeneration of M .
It is proved in [10, Theorem 2.6] that two self-dual
representations are isometric if and only if they are isomorphic. It follows that N is a
self-dual degeneration of M . Hence ησ

As above, Uj/Uj−1 and M//Ur are degenerations of I

spectively. Since Hom(Iβi , Iβj ) = 0 if i < j, we can apply the second part of

Proof. It is straightforward to construct a σ-compatible stability θsimp whose stable
representations are the simple representations and whose order by increasing slope
agrees with <. Existence and uniqueness of σ-Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltrations implies
a factorization of the identity characteristic function in the ﬁnite ﬁeld Hall module
of Q. Applying the Hall module integration map [45] to this factorization gives the
left-hand side of the equality. Lemma 5.4 gives a second factorization of identity
characteristic function, the integral of which gives the right-hand side.

Alternatively, Theorem 5.7 can be proved using Kazarian spectral sequences as
in [37, §6]. The new ingredient is a self-dual version of Voigt’s lemma, stating that
dimM is dimC Ext1(M, M )S. This can be proved using
the codimension of ησ
the cochain description of Ext1(M, M )S given in [46, Proposition 3.3].

We have proved that the restriction of the map (23) to the summand spanned

The previous paragraph implies a1 = 0. Repeating this argument we ﬁnd that
a1 = · · · = aN = 0, proving injectivity.

To complete the proof, note that together with the ﬁrst part of the theorem,
Theorem 5.7 implies that the Hilbert-Poincar´e series of the domain and codomain
of the map (23) are equal. Using injectivity of (23) we then see that (23) is an
isomorphism.
(cid:3)

The isomorphism (22) is the PBW factorization (18) associated to the stability
θsimp from the proof of Theorem 5.7. We expect an analogous statement to hold
for the isomorphism (23), with θsimp replaced by a σ-compatible stability θindec
whose stable objects are the indecomposable representations and whose order by
increasing slope is opposite to <. Without the assumption of σ-compatibility such
a stability is known to exist and in many examples, such as equioriented quivers,
we can check directly that it may be chosen σ-compatibly.
