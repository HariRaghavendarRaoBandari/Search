ABSTRACT
Detailed studies of galaxy formation require clear deﬁnitions of the structural components of
galaxies. Precisely deﬁned components also enable better comparisons between observations
and simulations. We use a subsample of eighteen cosmological zoom-in simulations from the
NIHAO project to derive a robust method for deﬁning stellar kinematic discs in galaxies. Our
method uses Gaussian Mixture Models in a 3D space of dynamical variables. The NIHAO
galaxies have the right stellar mass for their halo mass, and their angular momenta and Sérsic
indices match observations. While the photometric disc-to-total ratios are close to 1 for all the
simulated galaxies, the kinematic ratios are around ∼0.5. Thus, exponential structure does not
imply a cold kinematic disc. Above M∗ ∼ 109.5M⊙, the decomposition leads to thin discs
and spheroids that have clearly different properties, in terms of angular momentum, rotational
support, ellipticity, [Fe/H] and [O/Fe]. At M∗ . 109.5M⊙, the decomposition selects discs
and spheroids with less distinct properties. At these low masses, both the discs and spheroids
have exponential proﬁles with high minor-to-major axes ratios, i.e. thickened discs.

Key words: galaxies: stellar content - galaxies: structure - galaxies: kinematics and dynamics

1 INTRODUCTION

Galaxies are comprised of several components, including structures
such as the thin and thick discs, the bulge, and the stellar halo. Un-
derstanding how galaxies form and evolve requires understanding
what processes create each component and how material moves
from one component to another. Studying each component sepa-
rately requires a clear deﬁnition for each.

Broadly speaking the components of galaxies are classiﬁed
into two larger categories, discs and spheroids. Five main properties
distinguish discs from spheroids:

• Shape: Discs are ﬂattened with one axis much shorter than
the other two perpendicular axes that are of about the same length.
Spheroids are round with three perpendicular axes that are all about
the same length.

• Kinematics: Discs are rotationally supported. The dominant
component of disc stellar velocities is in the azimuthal direction.
Spheroids are dispersion supported such that stars follow random
orbits.

• Age: Discs often consist of young stars giving them blue col-
ors. Spheroids stopped forming stars Gyrs ago such that they have
red colors.

• Metal abundance: Metal abundance closely follows stellar
ages such that young discs have lower relative α-enrichment than
spheroids.

• Surface density proﬁle: Discs have mass surface density dis-
tributions well described by exponentials, while spheroids follow
de Vaucouleurs proﬁles. In typical galaxies, exponential proﬁles
dominate the outskirts of galaxies while steeper de Vaucouleurs
spheroids dominate the centres.

Before making detailed studies of the origin of galactic
structures, it is necessary to identify the individual components.
For a long time, galaxies were decomposed based only on their
photometric appearance (de Vaucouleurs 1959; van Houten 1961;
Freeman 1970; Yoshizawa & Wakamatsu 1975; Simien 1989).
Disc shaped galaxies with regular rotation curves mostly exhibit
exponential surface density proﬁles. So, galaxies with exponential
density proﬁles are usually assumed to have stars on regular circu-
lar orbits.

Discs and spheroids can be classiﬁed more robustly using their
dynamical properties. Discs are rotation supported, while spheroids
are dispersion supported. Precise stellar kinematics, however, can
only be measured for the Milky Way. In external galaxies, the max-
imum dynamical information is provided by Integral Field Unit
(IFU) spectroscopy in the form of 2D line-of-sight velocity mo-
ments maps (for example Bacon et al. 2001; Bershady et al. 2010;

2

Obreja et al

Cappellari et al. 2011; Sánchez et al. 2012; Bundy et al. 2015).
Each spectral element (spaxel) contains the combined light of stars
on a variety of orbits. To determine the relative proportions of stars
in each galaxy component, one can construct equilibrium model
galaxies out of stars selected from a variety of families and ener-
gies (a technique called “Schwarzschild modeling”, Schwarzschild
1979). For a recent example of Schwarzschild modeling using IFU
data, see van den Bosch & van de Ven (2009). As is an issue with
many observations, young stars are much brighter than old ones,
so when a galaxy contains a young stellar population, it makes it
difﬁcult to detect the kinematics of the old population. It is thus
likely that the disc component of galaxies containing young stellar
populations will be emphasized.

There has been signiﬁcant theoretical work on how stellar
discs and spheroids form in the context of galaxy formation. As
neighboring haloes collapse, their tidal torques provide the gas with
angular momentum (Peebles 1969; White 1984). Initially, gas and
dark matter have a common angular momentum. In the standard
picture, stellar discs form from gas that cools and settles into cen-
trifugal equilibrium at the bottom of the potential energy within a
spinning dark matter halo (White & Rees 1978; Fall & Efstathiou
1980; Efstathiou & Silk 1983). Since the gas is collisional it stays
on circular orbits, thus the stars also form with circular orbits. Discs
form in such models with exponential proﬁles over a few scale-
lengths (Dalcanton et al. 1997; Dutton 2009). These disc galax-
ies follow the observed Tully-Fisher relation and result in a scat-
ter on the size-rotation velocity plane consistent with observations
(Mo et al. 1998).

stellar populations comprise a thick disc and younger generations
constantly reform a thin disc. Recent numerical simulations
indicate that the picture might not be so straightforward. Discs

form thick out of a turbulent

In a hierarchical picture of galaxy formation, mergers
could disrupt
thin discs so extensively as to produce the
spheroid component (Davies & Illingworth 1983; Hopkins et al.
2009; Brooks & Christensen 2015; Kannan et al. 2015). The preva-
lence of thin discs in the Universe, though, implies that the ef-
fect of mergers is limited or that mergers could help reform discs
(e.g. gas rich mergers, Robertson et al. 2006; Hammer et al. 2009).
Post-merger smooth gas infall could also reform thin discs (e.g.
Villalobos et al. 2010; Puech et al. 2012; Moster et al. 2012).

Numerical simulations of galaxy formation have improved
considerably in the last decade (Brook et al. 2012; Aumer et al.
2013; Stinson et al. 2013b; Christensen et al. 2014; Hopkins et al.
2014; Kannan et al. 2014; Marinacci et al. 2014; Schaye et al.
2015; Wang et al. 2015). The important driver of these advances
was the implementation of effective stellar feedback (Stinson et al.
2006; Dalla Vecchia & Schaye 2008). Stellar feedback can pre-
vent the catastrophic loss of angular momentum that plagued ear-
lier simulations (e.g. Navarro & Steinmetz 2000). In this man-
ner, simulations now reproduce many of the statistical proper-

ties of galaxy populations (Aumer et al. 2013; Hopkins et al. 2014;
Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Schaye et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015).

In particular, the large sample of cosmological “zoom-in”
simulations presented by Wang et al. (2015) reproduces the stellar
mass - halo mass relation (Behroozi et al. 2013; Moster et al. 2013;
Kravtsov et al. 2014) over four orders of magnitude at various red-
shifts. The feedback model used (Stinson et al. 2006, 2013b) is able
to reproduce a wide range of observational constrains (Brook et al.
2012; Stinson et al. 2013b,a), not only for Milky Way mass systems
but also from dwarfs up to systems a few times more massive than
the Milky Way (Kannan et al. 2014; Brook et al. 2014; Dutton et al.
2015; Stinson et al. 2015; Tollet et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015). The
fact that these galaxies follow the the stellar mass - halo mass re-
lation over a wide range in mass and redshift makes this sample a
useful test for limiting star formation using stellar feedback.

Despite these successes, open questions still remain. In this
study we focus on two of them: the paucity of disc dominated
galaxies in simulations and the excess thickness of such discs.
Scannapieco et al. (2010) suggested that some of the “difﬁculty”
simulating bulgeless galaxies comes from inappropriately com-
paring observations and simulations. Observations of “bulgeless”
galaxies often rely upon surface density proﬁles. Simulations con-
sider the kinematics when determining the bulge fraction. One con-
sequence of using energetic stellar feedback to limit star forma-
tion is that the motions of gas are increased in simulations. These
increases lead to unrealistically thick discs (Agertz et al. 2013;
Roškar et al. 2014).

Decomposing simulated galaxies is more straightforward than
observed ones since we have the full six-dimensional (6D) phase
information about the positions of particles and their velocities, as
well as ages and abundances. All this information can also be used
to create mock images of simulated galaxies based on stellar pop-
ulation models. Thus, we can make a comparison between photo-
metric and kinematic decomposition techniques. Comparing these
techniques can shed light on how galaxies formed and provide an-
other test to see if galaxies simulated with stellar feedback share
the properties of observed galaxies.

The current standard kinematic decomposition of simulated
galaxies relies on analyzing the distribution of stellar circulari-
ties, ǫ (Abadi et al. 2003; Brooks 2008; Scannapieco et al. 2010,
2011; Brook et al. 2012; Martig et al. 2012; Kannan et al. 2015;
Zavala et al. 2015). The circularity, ǫ, is computed as ǫ(E) ≡
Jz/Jc(E), where Jz is the azimuthal angular momentum of a par-
ticle and Jc(E) is the angular momentum of a circular orbit having
the same binding energy, E. Such kinematic decompositions result
in galaxies with higher bulge to disc ratios than photometric decom-
positions of observed galaxies typically ﬁnd (Scannapieco et al.
2010). Classic decomposition methods, however, make ambiguous
classiﬁcations of stars with intermediate values of circularities.

If we wish to trace the origins of the disc and bulge compo-
nents, it would be helpful to eliminate, or at least minimize, these
ambiguous classiﬁcations. Since Jz is only one dimension of 6D
phase space, Doménech-Moral et al. (2012, hereafter DM12) sug-
gested adding binding energy, E, and the angular momentum com-
ponent perpendicular to the disc, Jp, to help classify stars less am-
biguously. Also, instead of adopting ﬁxed values in the various
coordinates to discriminate between the two components (Brooks
2008; Brook et al. 2012), they used a statistical cluster ﬁnding al-
gorithm to let the data decide where it should best be split.

In this paper, we use a sample of eighteen of Wang et al.
(2015)’s high resolution, “zoom-in” cosmological simulations from
the Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astrophysical Objects

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

(NIHAO) project. We propose and test a new kinematic decompo-
sition method based on the lines put forward by DM12. The ﬁrst
aim of this study is to have a robust deﬁnition of discs in simula-
tions, so that we can study their formation histories. The second
is to compare observations and simulations in a more robust way,
particularly the open issues of disc thickness and disc dominance.
Finally, having the sample of simulated galaxies spanning an order
of magnitude in stellar mass allows us to look for trends with mass
that can be subsequently used for predictions.

The paper is structured as follows. Section §2 describes the
simulation code and the galaxy sample. The kinematic decomposi-
tion method is presented in Section §3. All the ﬁve properties that
differentiate kinematic discs from kinematic spheroids are analysed
in the results section, §4. In the same section we also compare some
of the properties of the simulated galaxies with observational data.
The conclusions are presented in Section §5.

2.3 Sample

The halo selection for NIHAO “zoom-ins” used the cosmologi-
cal dark matter only simulations presented in Dutton & Macciò
(2014), without considering merger history. The NIHAO galaxies
cover a halo mass from 109.7 to 1012.3 M⊙. The simulations in-
clude around 106 dark matter and 106 gas particles inside rrvir. The
galaxies span two resolution regimes on either side of 5.55 × 1011
M⊙ that are described in detail in Wang et al. (2015). At lower
masses, the gravitational softening for star particles is 200 pc; at
higher masses, it is 400 pc.

We selected a subsample of galaxies from NIHAO based on
their edge-on discy appearance in composite SUNRISE (Jonsson
2006; Jonsson et al. 2010) images. The SUNRISE images are shown
in Fig. 1. These galaxies all lie in the halo mass range [1011–
1012M⊙]. The resulting sample of eighteen objects includes galax-
ies spanning a whole decade in halo and stellar mass.

2 SIMULATIONS

3 DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUE

The simulations we analyse in this work are a subsample of the
largest high resolution, “zoom-in” cosmological simulation sample
to date, NIHAO (Wang et al. 2015). These galaxies have been sim-
ulated with the new version of the N-body SPH code, GASOLINE
(Wadsley et al. 2004; Keller et al. 2014, 2015), assuming the latest
Planck cosmology (Planck Collaboration 2014).

2.1 Hydrodynamics

The new version of the GASOLINE code has several improvements
with respect to the older versions. The hydro-solver has been mod-
iﬁed following Ritchie & Thomas (2001) so that the problem of the
artiﬁcial cold blobs was greatly alleviated. One of the important dif-
ferences regards the use of a different SPH kernel (Dehnen & Aly
2012) and an increased number of neighbors (now 50). Other rele-
vant changes in the hydro-solver are the treatment of artiﬁcial vis-
cosity, now done as described by Price (2008), and the use of the
time step limiter proposed by Saitoh & Makino (2009).

Metal diffusion has been implemented as described in
Wadsley et al. (2008). The sources contributing to the heating func-
tion are photoionization and photoheating by a constant UV back-
ground (Haardt & Madau 2012), while the cooling function in-
cludes the effects of metal lines and Compton scattering (Shen et al.
2010).

Kinematic decomposition of stellar systems has evolved over the
last decade. Abadi et al. (2003) introduced a one dimensional de-
composition based on the circularity of stellar orbits, a method we
refer to as “classic”. DM12 added two more dimensions, total bind-
ing energy and motions perpendicular to the disc plane. They used
the k-means algorithm to classify particles. We present a reﬁnement
in which we use Gaussian Mixture Models for particle classiﬁca-
tion.

3.1 The classic method

The classic method of Abadi et al. (2003) does a good job
determining the relative mass of disc and spheroid (see also
Scannapieco et al. 2011; Martig et al. 2012). It assumes that the
spheroid is non-rotating and thus has a symmetric distribution of
circularities around ǫ=0. The thin disc gives the sharp peak at cir-
cularities close to maximum ǫ=1. Any extra features not accounted
for by the thin disc and spheroid are considered to be driven by
thick discs.

This decomposition method assigns particles with positive cir-
cularities to one component or another, such that the resulting prob-
ability distribution for the spheroid (no net rotation) is symmet-
ric. This assignation, however, is not unique. Thus, it is difﬁcult to
study the properties of discs and spheroids individually, or to follow
their evolution.

2.2 Star Formation and Feedback

3.2 k-means in multidimensional spaces

Star formation follows a Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, where the
eligible gas has a temperature lower than 15000 K and a den-
sity higher than 10.3 cm−3. Supernova feedback is implemented
following the blast-wave formalism (Stinson et al. 2006). Another
stellar feedback mechanism ejects energy prior to supernovae ex-
plosions (Stinson et al. 2013b). It accounts for the photoionizing ra-
diation of massive stars prior to their SN phase. The code traces the
evolution of heavy elements produced by SNe Ia (Thielemann et al.
1986) and SNe II (Woosley & Weaver 1995), assuming a Chabrier
IMF (Chabrier 2003). The free parameters in the feedback scheme
have been chosen so a Milky Way mass galaxy ﬁt the halo mass –
stellar mass relation at z = 0 (see Stinson et al. 2013b).

DM12 increased the number of dynamical parameters consid-
ered for the decomposition. They used an unsupervised clustering
method in the multi–dimensional space to assign particles to one of
three possible classes: thin discs, thick discs and spheroids. The two
new parameters are the binding energy, E, and the in–plane com-
ponent of the angular momentum normalized to Jc(E), Jp/Jc(E).
The motivation for considering the binding energy as a prior is that
discs are less bound than the primary component of the spheroid,
the bulge. Jp/Jc quantiﬁes the amount of motion out of the disc
plane.

The clustering method DM12 used to classify particles is k-
means (Schölkopf et al. 1998). k-means minimizes the intra–cluster

distance, where the intra–cluster distance is the sum of squared dis-
tances for all cluster pairs, also referred to as the “inertia” criterion.
The only input it requires is the number of clusters. The advan-
tage of k-means is that it always converges, given enough iterations.
However, the solution might be a local minimum. The number of
iterations can be signiﬁcantly reduced if the initial centroids are
chosen carefully (e.g. as far away from each other as possible or
based on prior information on the data set) instead of being ran-
domly assigned. The main disadvantage stems from two underly-
ing assumptions that clusters are convex and isotropic: k-means be-
haves poorly on irregular shaped manifolds or non-spherical clus-
ters. Another disadvantage is that the “inertia” criterion implies that
clusters will tend to have comparable number of members. This
means the method will only be suitable for galaxies having the mass
roughly equally distributed between the various components.

This method was applied to a small sample of simulated galax-
ies by Obreja et al. (2013) to study the properties of the galac-
tic bulge components. Domínguez-Tenreiro et al. (2015) used it to
study the evolution of the stellar disc and spheroid material within
the Large Scale Structure.

The simulated galaxy sample we analyse here is larger and
covers a wider range in galaxy morphologies than the objects in
DM12, Obreja et al. (2013) or Domínguez-Tenreiro et al. (2015).
For these reasons, the assumptions k-means uses (clusters convex-
ity, isotropy and similar weights) could lead to important biases.

3.3 Gaussian Mixture Models

We replace k-means with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) clus-
tering method that does not suffer from the above mentioned draw-
backs.

GMM is probabilistic in nature and assumes data points are
drawn from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with unknown
means and variances. Similar to the k-means method, it uses an

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

expectation–maximization algorithm to ﬁnd the parameters of the
Gaussians. Unlike k-means it allows the data to have various covari-
ance structures. The metric used is the Mahalanobis distance to the
cluster centres (means of the Gaussians). The clustering algorithm
on the simulated sample has been run with the Python package for
Machine Learning, scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. 2011). The
Python code that does the decomposition is now available upon
request. It will be publicly available by the end of this year. The
only input it needs is a simulation snapshot which is read using the
pynbody package (Pontzen et al. 2013).

We use the same parameter space of (jz/jc,jp/jc,e), except
that we switch to speciﬁc angular momentum and binding energy,
for which we use lower case letters. We also scale the binding en-
ergies of stars in each galaxy from -1 to 0, such that -1 represents
the most bound star particle and 0 represents the least bound star
particle. This scaling factors out the galaxy/halo mass dependence
and removes the dimensionality of the energy.

In this ﬁrst study of galaxy structure we limit ourselves to run
the clustering algorithm with only two components. The reason to
do so is that in this case GMM is able to clearly distinguish the disc,
as we will show. From now on, we will be referring to the non-disc
component as spheroid.

As an example, Fig. 2 shows the full 3D clustering analysis for
one galaxy projected onto the three axes, as well as the cumulative
distributions for each dimension. The uppermost panel in the left
column shows the classic 1D circularity distributions for particles
classiﬁed as disc/spheroid in blue/red, as well as for all particles in
grey. This galaxy shows a disc component that spans circularities
between 0.3 and 1.0. The maximum of the circularity distribution
is the disc component at ∼0.9. The spheroid component is almost
symmetric and centered at ∼0.0. The spheroid’s right wing breaks
the symmetry as it increases while the left one monotonically de-
creases. The ǫ distributions for the disc and spheroid overlap over
an extended range (from ∼0.3 to ∼0.8), but the other projections
make it clear why particles were assigned to each component.

The centre-left panel shows the binding energy as a function
of jz/jc. In it, the disc and spheroid particles mostly occupy dif-
ferent regions, though there is some overlap for the most bound
particles. The lower-left panel that shows jp/jc as a function of
jz/jc clariﬁes that the overlap comes from particles that have sig-
niﬁcant motions out of the disc plane. These particles with high
perpendicular velocities are assigned to the spheroid. For the rest
of this work we will be referring to the two galaxy components as
disc and spheroid. We make no attempt to divide the spheroid into
bulge and halo.

4 RESULTS

Using the GMM decomposition, we kinematically separate discs
from spheroids in the simulation sample. As a ﬁrst step, we com-
pare the GMM method with the classic one. Next we study all the
parameters that differentiate discs from spheroids: intrinsic shape,
speciﬁc angular momentum, rotational velocities, velocity disper-
sions, ages, abundances and surface mass density proﬁles. The
main reason to do so is to test if the various disc deﬁnitions are
consistent. All the quantities analysed are mass weighted, and as a
ﬁnal step, we make some comparisons with observations. The large
sample of galaxies can uncover trends in disc properties that can be
tested against observations.

Throughout this study discs are represented as stars, ⋆ and
spheroids as circles, ◦. In most cases, the spheroids are colored

are colour coded by various quantities to point out the correlation
between parameters. The parameters derived for all the stars in the
galaxy are given as empty (or ﬁlled) black squares. Observational
data are shown as grey symbols.

4.1 Kinematic decomposition of NIHAO

For each of the eighteen selected galaxies, we used the GMM al-
gorithm to assign all possible stars inside rvir to one of two com-
ponents, disc or spheroid. Table 1 gives some global parameters
of the sample based on their decomposition: halo mass (Mh), stel-
lar mass (M∗), virial radius (rvir), circular velocity at 0.1rvir (vc),
and disc-to-total ratios (D/T) from the GMM and classic kinematic
decompositions, using an empirical expression derived from IFU
data by Romanowsky & Fall (2012, hereafter RF12), and from the
2D Galfit (Peng et al. 2002, 2010) decomposition of the face-on
i-band SUNRISE images.

For a graphical summary of the decomposition, Fig. 3 shows
the eccentricity distribution for every galaxy in our sample. It com-
pares the GMM decomposition (solid red is spheroid, disc is solid
blue) with the classic method (dashed orange is spheroid, disc is
dashed cyan). The simulated galaxies are ordered based on their
mass which increases from left to right and top to bottom. There are
a couple of notable trends with mass. The low mass galaxies only
have one peak in their PDFs. At higher masses two peaks become
more evident. As the mass increases, the higher peak also increases
to greater circularity. Thus, higher mass galaxies have a higher frac-
tion of stars moving on exactly circular orbits. This translates in
less massive systems having more homogeneous stellar populations
characteristic of spheroids, while more massive systems are more
disc dominated.

In the GMM decomposition, some discs show a small fraction
of counter-rotating stars. Counter-rotating stars are allowed in the
GMM method because their parameters are closer to the disc com-
ponent than the spheroid. They are typically stars near the centre of
the galaxy. Their minimal presence supports the choice of not using
priors for the decomposition.

The decomposition explained for the galaxy shown in Fig. 2
is typical, but no two galaxies look exactly the same in this param-
eter space. In their 1D distributions, the galaxies show common
features:

(i) the maximum of the circularity distribution is always positive

indicating that every galaxy has a net rotation,

(ii) the spheroid includes stars with the highest jp/jc values; the

disc jp/jc distribution is skewed towards 0.0

(iii) the disc is less bound than the spheroid and covers a larger

range in binding energies.

Regarding the 2D distributions, a clear trend with total stellar mass
emerges in the sense that in the jz/jc – jp/jc plane there is less and
less overlap between discs and spheroids with increasing mass, ba-
sically reaching no-overlap for the most massive galaxies.

For the galaxies with two distinct maxima in the circularity
PDF, demanding two components makes sense. However, the oth-
ers exhibit a broad single peak, so the choice is less clear. The width
of the jz/jc distribution suggests the component is a spheroid, but
the median of the peak is always positive, indicating net rotation. It
is thus possible that low mass galaxies are fast rotating spheroids.
Fig. 4 shows mock IFU data for the simulations. These kinematic
signatures are much more similar to discs. The method of con-
structing the IFU maps is explained in detail in the Appendix. Thus,

Table 1. Simulation, halo mass (Mh), stellar mass (M∗), virial radius (rvir), circular velocity at 10% of the virial radius (vc), and disc-to-total ratios (D/T)
from the GMM and the classic kinematic decompositions, computed using the expression of RF12, and from the 2D Galfit decomposition of the face-on
i-band SUNRISE images for the sample of simulated galaxies.

our current analysis is inconclusive on whether the decomposition
should be limited to less than two components.

Whether more than two components should be allowed is an-
other concern. The current method cleanly deﬁnes thin discs, which
are the focus of the present study. Therefore, attempts to search for
more than two components are deferred to future work.

4.2 Disc–to–Total Ratios

The fundamental result of the decomposition is how much mass
is in each component. Fig. 5 shows the fraction of the total mass
classiﬁed into the disc component (D/T) as a function of stellar
mass. The GMM and classic D/T ratios are shown as the ﬁlled
black squares, (cid:4), and ﬁlled blue triangles, H. They have roughly
the same values for each galaxy, with the classic decomposition
yielding 5-20% higher values in nearly every case. The small dif-
ference between the kinematic decompositions stems from the clas-

sic method assuming a symmetric spheroid (no net rotation), while
the GMM method has a surplus of positive circularity stars in ev-
ery galaxy. Therefore, D/T for the GMM method is systematically
smaller than D/T for the classic one.

While it is hard to observationally decompose galaxies based
on kinematics, IFU are enabling initial attempts. Zhu et al. in prep.
are applying Schwarzschild models to spiral galaxies IFU data.
In this way various components of observed galaxies are sepa-
rated by classifying their reconstructed stellar orbits. As a ﬁrst step,

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

RF12 proposed a simpler decomposition to quantify D/T based on
a galaxy’s observed kinematics. Assuming discs and bulges have
exponential and de Vaucouleurs proﬁles, they deﬁne the kinematic
disc fraction as:

D/T = 1.35v/σp2. + (1.35v/σ)2,

(1)

where the factor 1.35 comes from projection effects and v/σ is
summed over a galaxy from IFU spaxels such that:

v/σ ≡s Σifiv2

Σifiσ2

los,i

los,i

.

(2)

In Equation 2, i runs over the spaxels inside an elliptical aperture of
area πR2
e, where Re is the half light radius. fi is the ﬂux, vlos,i the
line of sight velocity and σlos,i the line of sight velocity dispersion
of spaxel i.

Using the velocity moments maps constructed as explained in
the Appendix, we compute v/σ for the simulated galaxies. Since
we are concerned with the intrinsic properties of the simulated
galaxies, the spaxels contributions are weighted by mass instead
of light. The values of v/σ computed within half mass radii are
low, so D/T is low (∼0.2). If v/σ is computed to include the entire
galaxy, R=0.1rvir, instead, the values become comparable to those
found using the kinematic decomposition. These values are given
as grey triangles, N, in Fig. 5. While our calculation does not follow
the observed measure exactly, it shows that as kinematic observa-
tions improve, the results should converge to what is found with
complete kinematic information as we have from the simulations.
However, it is also a useful result since it proves an important point.
If we were able to have high S/N kinematic 2D data at large radii,
we could in principle recover true dynamical fractions. The differ-

8

Obreja et al

ence in D/T found from the central region and the entire galaxy is
unsurprising as the centre is bulge dominated.

In the same ﬁgure the results of photometric decompositions
are also provided as the empty red squares, (cid:3). For the photometric
decompositions, mock face-on i-band images were created using
the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, SUNRISE. SUNRISE calcu-
lates radiative transfer using a Monte Carlo scheme to take into ac-
count the effects of dust. The publicly available program Galfit
performs a least-squared ﬁtting routine to determine 2D galactic
structural parameters. To determine the photometric disc-to-total
ratio, we ﬁrst ﬁt the galaxy with a pure exponential disc. We use
the results from the pure exponential ﬁt as starting parameters for
a two component ﬁt consisting of an exponential disc with a Sersic
index of 1 and a de Vauccouleurs bulge with a Sersic index of 4. In
Fig. 5, the D/T that we report is Ldisc / (Ldisc + Lbulge).

A comparison of the kinematic and photometric decomposi-
tions shows a signiﬁcant discrepancy between the galaxy type in-
ferred (see also Scannapieco et al. 2010). The disc-to-total ratios
obtained from 2D ﬁts of the i-band surface brightness are very
close to 1 (89% of galaxies have D/T>0.8). However, deﬁning
D/T as the fraction of stellar mass in the kinematic disc, the val-
ues obtained are around 0.4 with a big scatter. The highest kine-
matic D/T is 0.8 for only one galaxy, while all the rest have ratios
smaller than 0.6. The stellar surface mass density proﬁles of most
of the galaxies in the sample tell the same story as the photometric
D/T, namely that they are in most cases pure exponentials. This re-
sult lessens concern about forming bulgeless discs in simulations.
Forming pure exponentials in simulations is straightforward. How-
ever, those “discs” are not necessarily kinematically cold. It also
highlights the importance of comparing simulations with observa-
tions using the same metric.

Fig. 5 highlights the large difference in D/T ratios found us-
ing kinematic versus photometric decompositions. Most of the low
mass galaxies have exponential proﬁles, so the photometric decom-
position gives D/T∼=1 for all the low mass galaxies while the kine-
matic D/T ratios for both the GMM and the classic method result
in ratios in the range [0.2, 0.6]. As the photometric D/T ratios fall
at higher masses, the kinematic D/T ratios rise.

4.3 Kinematics

To examine the properties of the individual kinematic components,
we begin our analysis with a comparison between two fundamen-
tal properties of galaxies, their stellar mass and speciﬁc angular
momentum. Fall (1983) placed observed galaxies onto this plane
and found that j∗-M∗ separated galaxies into distinct morpholo-
gies. In this way, the galaxy’s spin parameter, λ = JE1/2/GM 5/2,
should determine a galaxy’s morphology. Additionally, inside each
galaxy morphology, the galaxies followed a relation of j∗ ∝ M 2/3
.
For disc galaxies, that relation is the same as what Tully & Fisher
(1977) found. A simple unit based argument for the relation is that

Figure 6. Speciﬁc angular momentum as a function of stellar mass for the
kinematically deﬁned spheroids (red circles) and discs (blue stars). The red
and blue lines give the theoretical predictions for pure bulges and pure discs
from RF12, while the grey stars and circles show the observational data
sets of late types and ellipticals galaxies that they analysed. The simulated
spheroids follow the pure bulges line, albeit with a large scatter, while the
simulated discs also follow a power law, but with a shallower slope than
the theoretical prediction. The squares represent the full galaxies, color
coded by their respective kinematically deﬁned disc-to-total ratios. The up-
per panel gives the results obtained using the classic decomposition, while
the bottom one those of the GMM.

where j is the speciﬁc angular momentum, V is the velocity, R is the
radius and M is the mass of the entire galaxy halo. RF12 followed
up Fall (1983) with data that extended to larger radii. They found
that there was not a signiﬁcant amount of angular momentum in
the outer regions of elliptical galaxies and that the j∗ ∝ M 2/3
still
held.

where mk, rk and vk are the mass, position and velocity of particle
k, and k ranges over all stellar particle associated with the whole
galaxy, the kinematic disc or the kinematic spheroid. All galaxies
have been initially aligned such that the vertical direction is the
perpendicular to the gaseous disc plane.

Fig. 6 shows how the speciﬁc angular momentum varies as a
function of mass for the simulated galaxies. The disc (blue stars)
and spheroid (red circles) components are shown separate from the
total galaxy’s. The total galaxies are given as squares colored ac-

cording to their respective kinematic decomposition disc fractions.
Observed late type galaxies and ellipticals are shown as grey stars
and circles, respectively. The red and blue lines use the same nor-
malization as RF12, and both have a slope of 2/3.

The simulated spheroids follow the pure bulge line, albeit with
some scatter. In contrast, the discs follow a different power law
from the theoretical prediction, one that is ﬂatter. At low masses,
the simulated disc components have more angular momentum than
the RF12 prediction. The data points giving the full galaxies also
follow a power law, more similar to the disc, with a shallower slope
than the observationally derived function. While the simulations
differ somewhat from the theoretical predictions, it is clear that the
discs have more rotational support than the spheroids. In any case,
simulations overlap to a large extent with the observational data
analysed by RF12.

A couple spheroid components have speciﬁc angular momenta
values close to theoretical discs. In this plane, the two kinematic de-
compositions give very similar results. The most notable difference,
which is still minor, can be seen in the spheroid component. While
GMM gives spheroids that follow closely the pure bulge function
of RF12, the classic method results in shallower slope with stellar
mass.

4.4 Disc thickness

To form disc galaxies with the right stellar mass and ﬂat rotation
curves, simulations typically use stellar feedback to limit star for-
mation (e.g. Dalla Vecchia & Schaye 2012; Stinson et al. 2013b;
Aumer et al. 2013; Hopkins et al. 2014). Stellar feedback drives
turbulence in star forming gas. Simulations typically have larger
scale heights and vertical velocity dispersions than observations
(Stinson et al. 2013a; Roškar et al. 2014). In addition to feedback
driven turbulence, resolution can be a concern. The scaleheight of
the thin disc of the Milky Way that includes the youngest stars is
∼100 pc (Larsen & Humphreys 2003). A Milky Way mass galaxy
in NIHAO has a spatial resolution of 400 pc, so it is numerically
impossible for the disc to be as thin as the Milky Way’s thin disc.

To date, disc thickness measurements have only been pre-
sented for single simulated galaxies. Roškar et al. (2014) simulated
one galaxy using a variety of parameters. Comparing single galaxy
disc thicknesses is a challenge because observed galaxy disc thick-
nesses vary as a function of stellar mass (Dalcanton & Bernstein
2002; Yoachim & Dalcanton 2006).

Fig. 7 shows a comparison between our NIHAO sample and
several sets of observations (grey) of disc thickness. The disc thick-
ness observations come from Yoachim & Dalcanton (2006) and
Comerón et al. (2011), two surveys that take photometry of a num-
ber of edge-on disc galaxies. Determining disc thicknesses is chal-
lenging because even in nearby galaxies, discs are only a few arcsec
thick, close to the resolvable limit from the ground or with Spitzer.
Galaxies with vc > 120 km s−1 have prominent dust lanes that
block most of the light from the galactic midplanes.

Besides using different telescopes, these two studies com-
pute disc scale heights in different ways. Yoachim & Dalcanton
(2006) uses a three parameter ﬁtting function that simultaneously
determines the galaxy’s scale length and separate thin and thick
disc scale heights. They use an exponential for the radial proﬁle
and sech2 for the vertical proﬁle. sech2 is commonly used to ﬁt
vertical proﬁles since it is ﬂattens close to 0, but is exponential
away from 0. Most galaxies show sech2 vertical proﬁles, though
some are also straight exponentials. Some small decisions in the

Figure 7. Disc thickness, z0, as a function of circular velocity, vc, for the
spheroid (red circles in top panel) and disc (blue stars in bottom panel) com-
ponents. The simulated disc thicknesses are compared with observed thick-
nesses of edge-on galaxies shown in grey. Yoachim & Dalcanton (2006) are
shown as circles with error bars, Comerón et al. (2011) are shown as square
with error bars. The simulations fall in the same thickness range as obser-
vations, but with the opposite trend. The observations increase in thickness
with vc while the simulations decrease. The ﬁlled grey points tagged as
“MW young thin”, “MW young thick” and “MW old thick” are the scale-
heights for the Galaxy from Larsen & Humphreys (2003).

Yoachim & Dalcanton (2006) ﬁtting procedure pushed disc thick-
nesses to slightly higher values.

Comerón et al. (2011) break galaxies into four radial seg-
ments at ﬁxed fractions of r25 and provide separate thickenesses
at each radius. Comerón et al. (2011)’s ﬁtting procedures tend to
push thicknesses to lower values. Fig. 7 shows a median value of
the four Comerón et al. (2011) scale heights and the range as the
error bars. Since the observed galaxies are edge-on, it is straight-
forward to determine their rotation velocities from gas emission
lines.

The studies obtain disc thicknesses that vary up to a factor of
4. However, they ﬁnd thin-to-thick mass ratios that are quite similar.
We include both sets of observations to give a sense of how small
choices in ﬁtting observations can cause big changes in outcomes.
In Yoachim & Dalcanton (2006), the observed disc thick-
nesses increase with circular velocity. In Comerón et al. (2011), the
disc thicknesses remain nearly constant as a function of circular ve-
locity.

The simulation scale heights are best ﬁts of a sech2 function
to the vertical mass proﬁle between 0.5 kpc < z < 3 kpc. For sim-
plicity, the simulations are only ﬁt along the z-dimension. We as-
sume that the gas emission lines closely trace the gravitational po-

tential, so the simulated galaxies are placed at their corresponding

asymptotic circular velocity, vc =pGM/0.1rvir. The thicknesses

of the individual components are plotted on separate frames: the
spherical components (red circles) are plotted against the observed
thick discs; the disc components (blue stars) are plotted against the
observed thin discs; the total galaxy ﬁt (empty black squares) as
shown in both panels.

The simulations fall within the observed range of disc thick-
nesses. The disc thicknesses tend to decrease with increasing cir-
cular velocity. There is also not much difference between the ﬁts
of the disc and spheroid components. Typically, the spheroids are
thicker than the discs, but not in every case. In both observational
samples, thick discs are up to four times thicker than the thin discs.
Part of the discrepancy may be due to differences in the measure-
ment methods between simulations and observations. It is surpris-
ing that the spheroids have such small scale heights and seems to
present a better picture of simulated galaxies than what has been
shown in the past. The simulations are thicker than the Milky Way,
but other observed galaxies also appear to be thicker.

4.5 Velocity dispersion

Velocity dispersion is a complementary measurement of how kine-
matically hot galactic components are. IFUs make it possible to
observe velocity dispersions across entire galaxies. The DiskMass
Survey (DMS, Bershady et al. 2010) is an IFU survey of 146 galax-
ies. Martinsson et al. (2013) present velocity dispersions for a face-
on subsample of the DMS. Their 30 galaxies are disc-dominated
systems with no signiﬁcant asymmetries, bars, bulges, or inter-
acting companions. The sample thus represents the kinematically
coldest face-on discs in the DMS.

Outside of selection effects, comparing vertical velocity dis-
persions from simulations with the DMS is relatively straightfor-
ward since the DMS sample uses the width of stellar absorption
lines. These should correspond almost exactly with the scatter of
the line of sight velocities in every spaxel of mock IFU maps. We
create tessellated velocity maps of the dispersion in face-on images.
Like Martinsson et al. (2013), we create a vertical velocity disper-
sion proﬁle for each galaxy and ﬁt the proﬁle with an exponential
function. The central value of that exponential is the reported ver-
tical velocity dispersion (see Table A1). The details of the calcula-
tions are presented in the Appendix.

Comparing the rotation velocities is less straightforward than
the velocity dispersions because the typical inclinations in the ob-
servational sample are less than ∼ 30◦. Martinsson et al. (2013)
provide several estimated of the rotational velocity based on depro-
jections, which might depend on the exact inclination measured for
the galaxy. As a more robust proxy for rotation, they also derive
the rotation velocity by inverting the Tully-Fisher relation in the
K-band. The NIHAO galaxies also ﬁt on a tight Tully-Fisher rela-
tion when the rotation velocity is measured on the rotation curve

determined by the galactic potential, vc = pGM/R. Therefore,

we use the circular velocity at 10% of the virial radius, called vc in
Table 1, for our comparison with their data.

Fig. 8 shows vertical velocity dispersion as a function of ro-
tation velocity. As might be expected for a selection of simula-
tions being compared with a kinematically cold selection of ob-
served galaxies, the vertical velocity dispersions of the total galax-
ies (empty black squares) are ∼2 times higher than the observations
(grey squares). Such results are comparable with simulations run in
the past. Most of the kinematically selected discs (blue stars), how-
ever, fall on top of the observations. The kinematic decomposition

is successful at extracting a kinematically cold component in most
cases and that cold component is comparable to observed cold com-
ponents in real galaxies.

The simulated discs sample shows a few outliers from the ob-
servational relation that we examine to ﬁnd out whether anything
is different about these galaxies. The three cases we examine are
ones in which the vertical dispersion of the discs is equal to or ex-
ceeds the dispersion of the entire galaxy. The simulation g3.59e11
results in the full galaxy and the kinematic disc (magenta star) hav-
ing the same σz,0 ∼ 50 km s−1. The cause for this overlap is that
the full galaxy is not well described by an exponential decreasing
vertical velocity dispersion; σz,0 in this case does not vary with the
radius. However, the exponential decrease is a good approximation
for the kinematic disc of the galaxy. The same situation happens
with g5.36e11 which has σz,0 ∼ 75 km s−1 (its GMM disc is also
shown in magenta). These two galaxies show disturbed line of sight
velocity maps (see Fig. 4). The simulation g7.08e11, on the other
hand, is clearly a disc dominated system (see Figs. 1 and 3). In this
case, this is the reason why the kinematic disc (magenta star) and
the full galaxy have the same σz,0 ∼ 100 km s−1.

4.6 Shapes

The basic property of a disc is its ﬂat shape. In other words, discs
have one axis that is much shorter than the other two and the large
axes are roughly the same size. When a gas cloud is rotationally
supported, it will ﬂatten to the thickness supported by thermal pres-
sure and maintain a radial size according to how fast it is spinning
(Fall & Efstathiou 1980; Mo et al. 1998).

The intrinsic shape of galaxies can be quantiﬁed using the in-
ertia tensor. Following González-García & van Albada (2005), the
inertia tensor for a group of particles is deﬁned as:

m(k)(δij r2

(k) − xi(k)xj(k)),

(8)

Iij =Xk

where k runs over all particles and i(j) over the Cartesian co-

E16E26E3, that can be used to compute the lengths of the three
semiaxes a 1 b 1 c as follows:

a2 + b2 + c2 = 5(E1 + E2 + E3)/2

a2/b2 = (E3 + E2 − E1)/(E1 + E3 − E2)
a2/c2 = (E3 + E2 − E1)/(E1 + E2 − E3)

(9)

In this framework, the 3D shape of the discs and spheroids
can be quantiﬁed by the deviation from symmetry, or the so-called
intrinsic ellipticity parameter, ǫin ≡ 1 − c/a. Flat discs have high
ellipticity values, while rounder spheroids have values closer to 0.
Fig. 9 shows the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies (black
squares) and their disc (blue stars) and spheroid (red circles) as a
function of stellar mass. The GMM decomposition (bottom panel)
reveals separate correlations with mass for the discs and spheroids.
The disc intrinsic ellipticity remains constant, ǫin ∼ 0.7 as a func-
tion of mass. In contrast, the shape of spheroids changes signiﬁ-
cantly with mass. Spheroids in high mass galaxies are round, but
spheroids in lower mass galaxies become ﬂatter with a well deﬁned
slope of ∆ǫin ∼ 0.18 per decade of stellar mass (red dashed line).
While this relation makes it look like spheroids will share the same
shape as discs at low masses, there is little overlap in the GMM
sample.

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

In the ”classic“ decomposition there is signiﬁcant overlap be-
tween the regions occupied by the spheroids and discs. Also, the
correlation intrinsic ellipticity – mass for the spheroid has more
scatter.

Neither decomposition ﬁnds perfectly round spheroids. While
spheroids are expected to be mildly tri-axial, the relatively high ﬂat-
ness of the lower mass spheroids indicates they may contain disc,
namely a thick disc. Our simple two component decomposition ex-
plains the spheroid ﬂatness. The spheroid includes not only a bulge,
but potentially a bar, pseudobulge or/and thick disc. This ﬁgure sug-
gests that at the low mass end, there is little differentiation between
spheroids and discs, both having the appearance of thick discs.

Fig. 10 relates the shapes to their kinematics. To allow easier
comparison with observations, we derive properties as they are for
IFU spectral observations. Emsellem et al. (2004) found that λ is a
better indicator of rotational support than v/σ. They deﬁned λ as:

λ ≡

ΣimiRi|vlos,i|

(10)

ΣimiRiqv2

los,i + σ2

los,i

In Equation 10, i runs over the spaxels within an aperture of
0.1rvir, and mi is the spaxel mass, Ri the distance to the centre,
vlos,i the line of sight velocity and σlos,i line of sight velocity dis-

persion. The measured ellipticity, ǫms is computed from the 2D
mass distribution in the same 0.1rvir aperture:

ǫms ≡ 1 −s Σimiy2

i
Σimix2
i

,

(11)

where yi and xi are the positions of the spaxel i along the minor
and major axes, respectively. Both λ and ǫms are computed from
edge-on maps (see Appendix for more details).

In Fig. 10, the solid black curve gives the theoretical predic-
tion for oblate spheroids ﬂattened by rotation (Illingworth 1977;
Binney 1978; Cappellari et al. 2007), while the dashed curve sep-
arates fast and slow rotators. In this plane, the simulated galaxies
(empty black squares) follow a curve offset to lower spins than the
theoretical prediction. Both kinematic decompositions clearly sep-
arate discs from spheroids (high vs low spins and ellipticities). In
both cases, discs appear above the black curve and spheroids are
below. Classic spheroids show less rotation (by construction), oc-
cupying the region of slow rotators (below the dashed black curve).
The GMM discs show a correlation between shape and spin, while
the classic ones seem to have almost constant λ, irrespective of
shape. Also, the GMM discs reach higher λ values, all the way up
to the maximum, 1. Since the classic discs include more pollution
from spheroids, their maximum λ is 0.8. Neither decomposition
ﬁnds extremely ﬂattened systems (ǫms > 0.8).

In observations, the spin and shape parameters are typically
measured within the half light radius aperture. Given that we are
interested in intrinsic properties across our simulation sample (all
parameters are mass and not light weighted), we computed the spin
and shape parameters in apertures which include the full galaxies
(0.1rvir). In aperture this large, we ﬁnd the intrinsic and measured
ellipticities to follow an approximately one-to-one correlation. In
smaller apertures (half mass radii for example) the measured ellip-
ticities are systematically smaller than the intrinsic ones.

4.7 Ages

Determining the age of stars in discs and spheroids can constrain
their formation histories. Fig. 11 shows cumulative star formation
histories (SFHs) for each galaxy (top), GMM disc (middle) and
spheroid (bottom). The SFHs are colored and normalized accord-
ing to their ﬁnal mass at z = 0. The normalization allows for com-
parison of galaxies of different masses.

There is considerable variety among the SFHs of the full
galaxies (top panel) and no clear trend with ﬁnal stellar mass.
Some of the more massive (red curves) galaxies show elevated early
star formation, while others show vigorous star formation at late
epochs. The two lowest mass galaxies have almost constant spe-
ciﬁc star formation rates (sSFR) over long periods of time: ∼ 0.06
Gyr−1 for the ﬁrst half of the Universe age and ∼ 0.1 Gyr−1 for the
second one. A more detailed look at SFHs shows that star formation
is bursty on 100 Myr time-scales.

A look at the component SFHs shows that spheroids of the
massive galaxies rise sharply prior to 7 Gyr. About half of the
spheroids show a constant sSFR of ∼ 0.1 Gyr−1. There are ba-
sically no spheroids with rates smaller than this value.

The discs generally grow their mass slower than the spheroids,
though two of the most massive objects appear to grow only in the
last ∼4 Gyrs. The most extreme case forms 80% of its stars in the
last 3 Gyr. Most of the lower mass discs, however, grow their mass
steadily over a long time.

Figure 11. Cumulative stellar mass assembly tracks for the full galaxies
(top), their GMM discs (centre) and GMM spheroids (bottom), color coded
by the corresponding stellar mass at z=0.

In an attempt to boil complicated star formation histories
down to one number, Fig. 12 shows the median age of stars as a
function of the total stellar mass for the entire galaxy. We use the
total galaxy mass so that it is possible to compare the ages of the
discs and the spheroids of speciﬁc galaxies. At M∗ > 1010M⊙,
the spheroids are consistently older than the disc by several Gyr. At
M∗ < 1010M⊙, the ages of components are typically less separate.
At these lower masses, the ages converge down to a line slightly
younger than half the age of the Universe, 6.8 Gyr. A median age
around half the age of the Universe is in line with the interpre-
tation of Fig. 11 that lower mass galaxies steadily build up their
stellar masses. Another name for more massive galaxies forming
their stars earlier than low mass galaxies is “downsizing”.

Fig. 12 also shows another subtle difference between the
two decomposition methods. The classic method always ﬁnds
discs having younger stellar populations than their corresponding
spheroids. In GMM, four of the eighteen galaxies have younger
spheroids than discs.

It is surprising that spheroids should be younger. It is con-

ventional wisdom that stars always form in thin discs. Younger
spheroids mean that stars could form with non-negligible verti-
cal velocity dispersion. Such young bulges only form in low mass
galaxies where stellar feedback is able to drive turbulence and trig-
ger star formation out of the disc plane. It is interesting that the
classic decomposition that assumes spheroids have no net rotation,
ﬁnds older bulges as one would expect from galactic components
that have undergone signiﬁcant merging.

4.8 Chemical abundances

Observationally determining stellar ages of individual stars is often
complicated. Ages require resolving or taking spectra of individual
stars. In some cases, age dating might only provide rough ages for
entire populations. An easier thing to observe is the metal abun-
dance of galaxies. Metals are the result of star formation, so the
chemical abundance of galaxies gives a rough idea of when various
components of the galaxy formed. In this way, it can give a rough
observational estimate of the formation history of a galaxy.

One simple metric is the ratio between α elements like oxy-
gen, magnesium or calcium and iron. All these elements are pro-
duced in core collapse supernovae (SNII) of massive stars that hap-
pen soon after the birth of stellar populations. Over a longer time-
scale, type Ia supernovae (SNIa) enrich galaxies with only iron
peak elements. Thus, later enrichment from SNIa lowers the ratio
of α elements to iron and any stars that form thereafter will have
the chemical signature of a lower (solar) α-to-iron ratio. So, galac-
tic components that are dominated by stellar populations that form
quickly and do not have much subsequent star formation will be α-
rich, while populations that formed over a long time will be α-poor.
Stinson et al. (2013a) found that [α/Fe] is a better chronometer than
[Fe/H].

MNRAS 000, 000–000 (0000)

The upper panel in Fig. 13 shows the median metallicity,
[Fe/H], of the simulated galaxy components as a function of
their stellar mass. [Fe/H] increases steadily with stellar mass. For
M∗ >109M⊙, at ﬁxed stellar mass, discs are systematically more
metal rich than spheroids, which generally form their stars ear-
lier. We show only the GMM classiﬁcation because the differences
from the classic one are only minor. The [Fe/H] of the discs and
spheroids are slightly better separated for the GMM classiﬁcation
than for the classic one.

The lower panel Fig. 13 shows the median [O/Fe] for each
component as a function of stellar mass. The [O/Fe] relation with
stellar mass is different than [Fe/H]. Instead of [O/Fe] steadily in-
creasing, [O/Fe] ∼ 0.05 for M∗ < 109M⊙. Most of the higher
mass total galaxies and components have median [O/Fe] ∼ 0.15.
The only exception are a few high-mass spheroid components that
have [O/Fe] ∼ 0.25. These spheroids have experienced intense
early periods of star formation. The higher mass galaxies are also
the ones that are more disc dominated. This directly translates into
continuous levels of star formation throughout the disc history,
which increase the oxygen abundance. However, the initial high
levels of star formation ensure that many SNIa enrich the galaxy
with iron, decreasing [O/Fe]. We show only the GMM classiﬁca-
tion in this ﬁgure since the classic one gives very similar results.

As with the other properties examined, the difference becomes

less in lower mass galaxies.

4.9 Surface density proﬁles

In general, the 2D and 1D light proﬁles of galaxies are well de-
scribed by Sérsic functions. One common assumption about ob-
served galaxies is that a galaxy with a Sérsic index n ∼ 1, which is
close to exponential, is characterized as a disc. Fig. 5 showed that

14

Obreja et al

most of the simulated galaxies have pure exponential light proﬁles,
so it is interesting to look at the actual mass proﬁles.

Fig. 14 shows all eighteen surface mass density proﬁles for
GMM discs (solid blue), GMM spheroids (dashed red) and full
galaxies (solid black). The proﬁles have been normalized to Σe of
the full galaxies and given as a function of R/Re. Re is the half mass
radius of the full galaxies viewed face-on. About 2/3 of the less
massive galaxies (black curves on the top and centre rows) are ex-
ponential to at least 5Re. Based on mass proﬁles only, one would be
tempted to classify these galaxies as pure discs. However, our kine-
matic decomposition showed two distinct components. At higher
masses, central concentrations start to appear.

In the same ﬁgure, the kinematic discs (blue) and spheroids
(red) show a wide range of behaviors. For example, g1.05e11,
g5.31e11 or g7.55e11 show discs and spheroids as one would ex-
pect from a simple two component χ2 ﬁt. Their spheroids domi-
nate the central regions, while their discs have exponential proﬁles
and dominate the external parts. Other galaxies, like g2.42e11 and
g5.02e11 have exponential discs, but spheroids that dominate both
the innermost and the outermost regions (probably their bulges and
stellar haloes have different origins). g7.08e11 also shows a rather
peculiar behavior, being a clearly disc dominated galaxy with a
spheroid proﬁle a scaled version of the disc one. The fact that this
galaxy is disc dominated is also clear from both the SUNRISE image
(Fig. 1) as well as from the circularity distribution (Fig. 3).

In any case, two common features show up in almost all the
galaxies of the sample. The spheroids do not have strongly central
peaked proﬁles, but look rather smooth and close to exponentials.
On the other hand, discs can be described by exponentials on ex-
tended ranges and in most cases do not extend to the innermost
parts. Most of the disc proﬁles show central dips, simply because
the GMM decomposition associates very few of the inner stellar
particles with them. However, observationally discs are assumed to
extend all the way to the galaxy centre.

The most surprising aspect of all of these simulations is how
close the kinematically selected spheroids are to exponential den-
sity proﬁles. Observationally, some dwarf galaxies are not thin
discs, but have exponential proﬁles (Graham & Guzmán 2003). It
seems that an exponential density proﬁle is an insufﬁcient discrim-
inant between discs and non-discs. Fig. 14 points out that, in the
absence of information on the stellar dynamics, surface density pro-
ﬁles are not sufﬁcient to classify galaxies as kinematic discs with
purely circular orbits.

4.10 Sérsic indices

When ﬁtting proﬁles, various problems can occur due to the large
number of parameters, the binning, or the ﬁtting range. These issues
can be avoided by using non-parametric deﬁned quantities, like the
radius that encloses a ﬁxed fraction of the total mass. Therefore,
rather than ﬁtting the Sérsic proﬁle directly, we use the correspond-
ing mass enclosed inside a given radius R:

M (< R) = 2πZ R

0

Σ(x)xdx

= 2πR2

eΣe

nebn
b2n
n

γ(2n, bn(R/Re)1/n)

(12)

In Equation 12, Σe is the surface mass density at half mass (or
effective) radius, Re, γ is the lower incomplete Gamma function
and bn is approximated by bn ≃ 1.9992n − 0.3271. Σ(R) is the
Sérsic function Σeexp(−bn((R/Re)1/n − 1)). Using Equation 12

for two different fractions of the total mass, f1 and f2 (for example
90% and 50%), results the following equation for the Sérsic index
that can be solved numerically:

γ(2n, bn(Rf1 /Re)1/n)

f1

−

γ(2n, bn(Rf2 /Re)1/n)

f2

= 0

(13)

The values of the Sérsic index in Table A1 are computed in
this manner using the radii enclosing 90 and 50% of the mass, re-
spectively.

Fig. 15 gives the Sérsic index, n, derived using Equation 13 as
a function of stellar mass for all the simulated galaxies in the sam-
ple. The solid curve comes from Dutton (2009)’s parameterization
of the n-M∗ correlation for blue galaxies. Dutton (2009) split SDSS
observations of galaxies (Blanton et al. 2005) into red and blue
samples according to their colors. He ﬁt the median n as a function
of stellar mass. The low mass median blue galaxies in the SDSS
sample have Sérsic indices close to 1.5. That means they are nearly
exponential, but the median galaxy is best-ﬁtted with a slight bulge.
While there are fewer blue galaxies above M∗ = 2.5 × 1010M⊙
than below, the Sérsic indices increase at this transition mass. There
are more red galaxies at these higher mass that also have Sérsic in-
dices near 4. The combined SDSS sample including both red and
blue galaxies shows a similar transition to the discs, but at slightly
lower mass.

We choose to compare our simulations with the blue sample
since all of our galaxies are forming stars at the z = 0. Also, our
sample was selected to include the most discy (ﬂat) galaxies. Ad-
ditionally, NIHAO contains only isolated galaxies, which have a
lower likelihood of being red than galaxies that form in a denser
environment.

The simulated sample does not include enough galaxies to
make a rigorous quantitative comparison with the observed Sér-
sic indices. We base our comparison on the black squares that
show the Sérsic for the entire galaxy. Qualitatively, the simula-
tions follow the shape of the observed relation. The simulated
galaxies at M∗ < 1010M⊙ have Sérsic indices around 1. Above
M∗ > 1010M⊙, the Sérsic indices generally rise following a simi-
lar trend to the observations.

As opposed to mass proﬁles, light proﬁles can be effected by
dust, which makes the centre of galaxies appear to have less of a
bulge and hence lower the Sérsic indices.

There is a slight hint that the simulations have lower Sérsic in-
dices than observations. Low Sérsic indices might indicate that the
stellar feedback could be too strong in the NIHAO sample. However,
a deﬁnite statement would require a larger sample of galaxies and
is beyond the scope of this paper. It is also interesting that deep
photometric imaging have revealed low mass (108M⊙) galaxies
with Sérsic indices below 1 (see observations by van Dokkum et al.
2015; Koda et al. 2015).

The individual kinematic components generally follow the en-
tire galaxy Sérsic indices. From the lowest masses, this is par-
ticularly true. The surface density proﬁles of material traveling
along circular orbits, the disc, has a similar spatial distribution
to material that has higher velocity dispersion (spheroid). Above
M∗ > 109.5M⊙, the components start to show independent distri-
butions. The discrepancy in Sérsic index then increases with mass.
For the most part, the spheroidal component has a higher Sérsic
index, though there are a couple cases where the disc has higher n.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We present a new kinematic decomposition technique and use it
to decompose a subsample of the NIHAO suite of zoom-in cosmo-
logical simulations (Wang et al. 2015) at z = 0 into discs and
spheroids. The shapes, kinematics, ages, and abundances of the
discs are compared with those of the spheroids. Additionally, the
structural parameters of the NIHAO galaxies are compared with ob-
servations.

The new decomposition technique minimizes ambiguous par-
ticle classiﬁcation across a large sample of galaxies with a variety

of morphologies. It thus enables future studies of the formation and
evolution of galaxy components.

There are three main ﬁndings of the study:

• While the properties of discs and spheroids differ as expected
in high mass galaxies, they merge below 109.5M⊙. Such low mass
galaxies are deﬁned by a structure that is somewhere in between
thin discs and spheroids, something resembling a thick disc.

• Many of the galaxies in our sample exhibit pure exponential
surface brightness proﬁles, a signature typically associated with
pure disc galaxies. However, the kinematic decomposition ﬁnds
thin disc fractions less than 50% in many galaxies showing that
surface brightness proﬁles are not an optimal indicator of galaxy
kinematics.

• The kinematic properties of the GMM discs agree well with

observations of disc dominated systems.

5.1 Decomposition technique

The method builds on previous work by DM12, but employs Gaus-
sian Mixture Models to ﬁnd groups in a 3D parameter space (jz/jc,
e, jp/jc) rather than k-means.

With numerical simulations, it is possible to compare the pho-
tometric structure with the kinematic structure since the simulation
outputs all six position and velocity variables. Most of previous
kinematic decompositions of simulations have focused on one vari-
able, the angular momentum of stars, and assume the spheroid has
no net rotation.

When our decomposition was compared with the “classic”
one, we found some subtle differences. The biggest difference is
that the GMM method makes a clear selection of disc and spheroid
particles. Thus, the GMM discs show more coherent rotation than
the classic method and a ﬂatter shape. Somewhat surprisingly,

16

Obreja et al

spheroids of low mass galaxies also show some rotation and ﬂat-
ter shape using the GMM decomposition.

The classic decomposition method always ﬁnds spheroids are
older than discs. In a few cases, the GMM method ﬁnds spheroids
with median ages younger than their corresponding discs. How this
happens in the simulations will require a follow-up study, but could
have signiﬁcant implications for the galaxy formation paradigm. It
could provide evidence that stars do not always form in thin discs.

discs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the total galaxies have twice the ve-
locity dispersion of the kinematically cold DMS sample.

Stellar feedback forms galaxies with thick discs that are typi-
cally more massive than observed. Using the GMM decomposition
technique, it is possible to classify stars into distinct kinematically
cold and hot components. Following up on the formation and evolu-
tion of these components will provide insights into how to improve
galaxy formation simulations and begin to provide detailed answers
to how galaxies really form.

5.2 Disc–spheroid comparison

Kinematically deﬁned discs are thinner than spheroids, typically
younger, more metal rich, have lower [α/Fe], lower Sérsic indices
and higher spin parameters.

The properties of discs and spheroids showed signiﬁcant
trends as a function of galaxy mass. At low masses, the distinc-
tion between discs and spheroids disappeared in their velocity dis-
persion, age, chemical enrichment and Sérsic index. The prop-
erties start to differ only above M∗ & 109.5M⊙. We note that
Simons et al. (2015) observe a similar break in galactic kinematic
properties at exactly this same mass.

The jz/jc distribution functions of the lowest mass galaxies
are in agreement with a unique slowly rotating spheroid compo-
nent, indicating that demanding that two components exist may be
inappropriate. However, the velocity maps show signatures of co-
herent rotation even in these low mass systems. It is, thus likely that
they have some sort of disc as component.

The low mass galaxies all show nearly exponential stellar
surface density proﬁles despite including a large fraction of stars
with high velocity dispersions. When broken down into disc and
spheroid components, both components exhibit exponential pro-
ﬁles. Thus, our results show that there is no direct relationship be-
tween exponential proﬁles and circularly rotating thin discs.

5.3 Comparisons with observations

The speciﬁc angular momenta, velocity dispersions and Sérsic in-
dices of the simulated galaxies are compared with the analogue
properties of observed galaxies. While the comparisons are non-
trivial because of selection effects and limited sample sizes, the
simulated galaxies show similar properties as the observed galax-
ies in all cases.

The simulated galaxies fall on top of observed ones in the stel-
lar mass - speciﬁc angular momentum plane. When broken down
into kinematic components, both simulated discs and spheroids
show a shallower correlation between speciﬁc angular momentum
and mass than the theoretical expectations for pure spirals and el-
liptical galaxies, but consistent with observations.

The Sérsic indices of the simulated galaxies vary with stellar
mass as do late type SDSS galaxies for M∗ >109.5M⊙. For smaller
stellar masses n ∼ 1.

Previous studies have shown that simulations using stellar
feedback to limit star formation produce galaxies that are too thick.
NIHAO does not clarify that result. The simulations, including the
kinematically cold thin disc component, are three times thicker
than the thin discs in the sample of edge-on Spitzer galaxies pre-
sented by Comerón et al. (2011). Despite this, the velocity disper-
sions of the thin disc components match the vertical velocity dis-
persions from the Martinsson et al. (2013)’s kinematically cold IFU
DiskMassSurvey. The galaxies and their spheroid components are
about the same thickness as Comerón et al. (2011)’s observed thick

APPENDIX

Here we describe the manner in which we compute line of sight
velocities and velocity dispersions maps for our simulations. We

18

Obreja et al

also discuss the way in which we derive simulation analogues to
observables from these mass weighted maps.

In observations, IFU data cover a limited ﬁeld of view by a
2D regular grid (Cartesian or hexagonal) with varying signal-to-
noise (S/N) from pixel to pixel, without considering the S/N de-
pendency on the wavelength range. Therefore, quantities computed
from these maps have to take into account the varying S/N. A more
general method however, is to rebin the 2D regular grid as to en-
sure an approximately uniform S/N and then generate a Voronoi
mesh from the centroids of the rebinned grid. This approach has
been implemented by Cappellari & Copin (2003) for the SAURON
Project (Bacon et al. 2001). The same method has been used for
other IFU surveys like ATLAS3D (Cappellari et al. 2011), as well
as to post-process simulated galaxies (e.g. Naab et al. 2014).

In this study, we are concerned with intrinsic properties of the
simulations. Binning and rebinning the SPH particle data would al-
low for a closer comparison with observations. However, it would
also add uncertainties. As such, we chose to do the Voronoi tessel-
lation directly on the stellar particles. In this way, each of the 2D
spaxels has approximately the same number of SPH particles. This
is equivalent to the constant S/N spaxels in real IFU data.

In observations, the different moments of the velocity ﬁelds
are computed by ﬁtting stellar absorption lines of each spaxel sep-
arately. A common choice for the ﬁtting function is the Gauss-
Hermite (Bender et al. 1994). The equivalent in simulations is to
ﬁt the distribution of particles’ line-of-sight velocities in each spax-
els. However, instead of assuming a functional form for the velocity
PDFs (which might or might not be appropriate), we choose to use
nonparametric statistics. Therefore, we compute the line-of-sight
velocity (vlos) and line-of-sight velocity dispersion (σlos) of each
spaxel as the mass weighted mean and variance of the empirical
distribution of particle velocities (vi):

vlos = Σiwivi
σ2
los = Σiwi(vi − vlos)2

(A1)

In Equation A1, i runs over the particles in the spaxel and
wi=mi/Σimi is each particle’s weight. The Voronoi tessellations
for all the galaxies were constructed requiring 1024 elements. The
tessellation produces approximately equal number of particles in
each spaxels. This translates into some spaxels (mostly close to the
border of the domain) having a smaller number of particles. There-
fore, when computing the statistics for each of them, we tag as “bad
spaxels” those that contain less than 30 particles. The tessellations
and maps have been constructed for the galactic region, deﬁned as
a sphere with radius 0.1rvir.

Fig. A1 shows an example of vlos (left column) and σlos (cen-
tral column) maps from an edge-on view of the simulated galaxy
g7.55e11 (top row), and its GMM disc (central row) and GMM
spheroid (bottom row). The right column of the ﬁgure gives the
corresponding stellar mass distributions. Each column in the ﬁgure
shares a common color coding in order to facilitate the comparison
between the full galaxy and its kinematic components.

The upper left panel of the ﬁgure gives the vlos of the full
galaxy. It shows unambiguously the signature of a rotating disc.
The corresponding σlos map (upper central panel) also shows a
distinctive feature: two central and symmetric dispersions maxima
above and below the equatorial plane. The dispersion along the ma-
jor axis is almost half the one along the minor axis, and decreases
with the distance from the centre. In the stellar mass distribution

panel (upper right), the full galaxy is clearly a highly ﬂattened sys-
tem.

Looking at the two kinematic components, we see that the disc
is mainly responsible for the rotation signature in the full galaxy.
The spheroid is responsible for the double velocity dispersion peak.
The disc, however, also shows a double σ peak but less pronounced
(∼80 km s−1 as compared to ∼120 km s−1). The equivalent goes
for the spheroid, which also rotates, but much slower than the disc
(∼40 km s−1 as compared to ∼160 km s−1). The disc and spheroid
mass distributions in the right column complement the velocity in-
formation. The former is clearly a highly elongated structure, while
the later is approximately spherical.

These kind of maps can provide more than a qualitative idea of
galaxy structure. A whole range of parameters that can be used to
quantify the kinematic structure of galaxies can be extracted from
them (see for example Cappellari et al. 2007). In this study, we have
analysed some of these parameters, namely: spin (λ), measured el-
lipticity (ǫms), central vertical velocity dispersion (vz,0), and max-
imum rotational velocity (vmax).

Fig. A2 gives a graphical description of how the four param-
eters mentioned above are derived from the maps. As for the pre-
vious ﬁgure, the top, central and bottom rows give the full galaxy,
the GMM disc and the GMM spheroid of g7.55e11. The spin and
ellipticity parameters shown in the left column are optimally de-
rived when galaxies are viewed edge-on. Same goes for the rota-
tion curve (right column). The central vertical velocity dispersion,
however, is optimally derived when the galaxy is viewed face-on
(central column).

The spin and ellipticity (solid and dashed curves in the left
column) have been computed with equations 10 and 11 in circular
apertures, up to the maximum one of 0.1rvir. In observations, ellip-
tical apertures are used instead. Since we weight the spaxels with
the mass, the bias introduced by circular apertures when the maps
show elongated features should be small. The parameter most sen-
sible to the aperture choice is ǫms. In this case, we have checked
that the measured ellipticity in an aperture of 0.1rvir is actually a
very good estimator for the intrinsic ellipticity derived from the in-
ertia tensor of the particles within the same radius. Therefore, we
are conﬁdent that changing the aperture from circular to elliptical
will not alter our conclusions.

The central column of the ﬁgure shows the values of all spax-
els σlos as a function of radius, R. The solid curves in these pan-
els are the exponential χ2 ﬁts to the simulation data. Each spaxel
contribution has been weighted by its mass. In this manner we de-
rived the central vertical velocity dispersions that were used in Sec-
tion 4.5. In order to obtain a robust estimator for σz,0, we limited
the ﬁt range to [0,R90] for the full galaxies. For the GMM discs we
additionally excluded the 2 kpc innermost region since the decom-
position leads to central dips.

The right column of Fig. A2 gives vlos as a function of the
position along the major axis, x. The colors quantify the position
along the minor axis, y. From these ﬁgures, we derived vmax as
the maximum of |vlos|. The disc and full galaxy show a typical
rotation curve for a late type galaxy, with velocities decreasing with
increasing distance from the equatorial plane, for a ﬁxed position
along the major axis.

Table A1 gives all the quantities we have analysed in this
study for the eighteen galaxies and their GMM deﬁned discs and
spheroids.

Figure A2. Left column: radial proﬁles of the spin (solid curves) and measured ellipticity (dashed curves) from an edge-on view of the galaxy g7.55e11 (top),
and its GMM deﬁned disc (centre) and spheroid (bottom). Central column: radial dependence of the line of sight velocity dispersion from a face-on view of
the same galaxy (top) and its GMM disc and spheroid (central and bottom rows, respectively). The black, blue and red curves are the exponential ﬁts to the
grey, light blue and light red symbols, respectively. The central line of sight velocity dispersions, σz,0 of Fig. 8 are the central values from these exponential
ﬁts. Right column: Line of sight velocities as functions of radial distance color coded by the distance from the equatorial plane for the same galaxy viewed
edge-on and its two GMM components (top to bottom).
