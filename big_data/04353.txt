In 1973 Paschke deﬁned a factorization for completely positive maps between C∗-algebras. In this
paper we show that for normal maps between von Neumann algebras, this factorization has a univer-
sal property, and coincides with Stinespring’s dilation for normal maps into B(H ).

The Stinespring Dilation Theorem[Sti55] entails that every normal completely positive linear map (NCP-
map) ϕ : A → B(H ) is of the form A π
/ B(H ) where V : H → K is a
bounded operator and π a normal unital ∗-homomorphism (NMIU-map). Stinespring’s theorem is fun-
damental in the study of quantum information and quantum computing:
it is used to prove entropy
inequalities (e.g. [Lin75]), bounds on optimal cloners (e.g. [Wer98]), full completeness of quantum
programming languages (e.g. [Sta15]), security of quantum key distribution (e.g. [KSW08]), analyze
quantum alternation (e.g. [BP15]), to categorify quantum processes (e.g. [Sel07]) and as an axiom to
single out quantum theory among information processing theories.[CDP11] A fair overview of all uses
of Stinespring’s theorem and its consequences would warrant a separate article of its own.
is the Stinespring dilation categorical in some way? Can the Stinespring dilation
theorem be generalized to arbitrary NCP-maps ϕ : A → B? In this paper we answer both questions in
the afﬁrmative. We use the dilation introduced by Paschke[Pas73] for arbitrary NCP-maps, and we show
that it coincides with Stinespring’s dilation (a fact not shown before) by introducing a universal property
for Paschke’s dilation, which Stinespring’s dilation also satisﬁes.

One wonders:

In the second part of this paper, we will study the class of maps that may appear on the right-hand
side of a Paschke dilation, to prove the counter-intuitive fact that both maps in a Paschke dilation are
extreme (among NCP maps with same value on 1).

This gives a universal property to the von Neumann algebra M2 of 2× 2 complex matrices, (which is a
model of the qubit.)

1 Two universal properties for Stinespring’s dilation
Let ϕ : A → B(H ) be a NCP-map where A is a von Neumann algebra and H is a Hilbert space. In
this section, we prove that any minimal normal Stinespring dilation of ϕ gives a Paschke dilation of ϕ.
Let us ﬁrst recall the relevant deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 10. A normal Stinespring dilation of ϕ, is a triple (K ,π,V ), where K is a Hilbert space,
π : A → B(K ) is an NMIU-map, and V : H → K a bounded operator such that ϕ = AdV ◦π, where
Adv : B(K ) → B(H ) is the NCP-map given by AdV (A) = V ∗AV for all A ∈ B(K ).1 If the linear span
of {π(a)V x: a ∈ A x ∈ H } is dense in K , then (K ,π,V ) is called minimal.

It is a well-known fact that all minimal normal Stinespring dilations of ϕ are unitarily equivalent (see
e.g. [Pau02, Prop. 4.2]). We will adapt its proof to show that a minimal Stinespring dilation admits a
universal property (Prop. 13), which we will need later on. The adaptation is mostly straight-forward,
except for the following lemma.
Lemma 11. Let π : A → B, π(cid:48) : A → C be NMIU-maps between von Neumann
algebras, and let σ : C → B be an NCP-map such that σ ◦ π(cid:48) = π.
Then σ (π(cid:48)(a1)cπ(cid:48)(a2) ) = π(a1)σ (c)π(a2) for any a1,a2 ∈ A and c ∈ C .
Proof. By Theorem 3.1 of [Cho74], we know that, for all c,d ∈ C ,

A π

B

π(cid:48)

C

σ

σ (d∗d) = σ (d)∗σ (d) =⇒ σ (cd) = σ (c)σ (d).

(1)
Let a ∈ A . We have σ (π(cid:48)(a)∗π(cid:48)(a)) = σ (π(cid:48)(a∗a)) = π(a∗a) = π(a)∗π(a) = σ (π(cid:48)(a))∗σ (π(cid:48)(a)). By (1),
we have σ (cπ(cid:48)(a)) = σ (c)σ (π(cid:48)(a)) ≡ σ (c)π(a) for all c ∈ C . Then also σ (π(cid:48)(a)c) = π(a)σ (c) for
all c ∈ C (by taking adjoints). Thus σ (π(cid:48)(a1)cπ(cid:48)(a2) ) = π(a1)σ (cπ(cid:48)(a2)) = π(a1)σ (c)π(a2) for
all a1,a2 ∈ A and c ∈ C .

1Be warned: many authors prefer to deﬁne AdV by AdV (A) = VAV∗ instead.

Lemma 12. Let K be a Hilbert space. If AdS = AdT for S,T ∈ B(K ), then S = λ T for some λ ∈ C.
Proof. See appendix.
Proposition 13. Let (K ,π,V ) and (K (cid:48),π(cid:48),V (cid:48)) be normal Stinespring dilations of ϕ. If (K ,π,V ) is
minimal, then there is a unique isometry S: K → K (cid:48) such that SV = V (cid:48) and π = AdS◦π(cid:48).
Proof. Let us deal with a pathological case. If V = 0, then ϕ = 0, V (cid:48) = 0, K = {0} and π = 0, and so
the unique linear map S: {0} → K (cid:48) satisﬁes the requirements. Assume V (cid:54)= 0.
(Uniqueness) Let S1,S2 : K → K (cid:48) be isometries with SkV = V (cid:48) and AdSk ◦π(cid:48) = π. We must show
that S1 = S2. We have, for all, a1, . . . ,an,α1, . . . ,αn ∈ A , x1, . . . ,xn,y1, . . . ,yn ∈ H , and c ∈ C ,

by Lemma 11
as SkV = V (cid:48)

Since the linear span of π(A )V H is dense in K , we get AdS1 = AdS2. Thus λ S1 = S2 for some λ ∈ C
by Lemma 12. Since V (cid:54)= 0, there is x ∈ H with V x (cid:54)= 0. Then S1V x = V (cid:48)x = S2V x = λ S1V x, and
so λ = 1. Thus S1 = S2, as desired.

Hence there is a unique isometry S: K → K (cid:48) such that Sπ(a)V x = π(cid:48)(a)V (cid:48)x for all a ∈ A and x ∈ H .
Since SV x = Sπ(1)V x = π(cid:48)(1)V (cid:48)x = V (cid:48)x for all x ∈ H , we have SV = V (cid:48). Further, for all a,a1, . . . ,an ∈

π(ai)V xi.

Since the linear span of π(A )V H is dense in K , we get Sπ(a) = π(cid:48)(a)S. Note that S∗S = 1, because S
is an isometry. Thus S∗π(cid:48)(a)S = S∗Sπ(a) = π(a), and so AdS◦π(cid:48) = π.

Proof. Let P(cid:48) be a von Neumann algebra. Let ρ(cid:48) : A → P(cid:48) be a
NMIU-map, and f (cid:48) : P(cid:48) → B(K ) an NCP-map with f (cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = ϕ.
We must show that there is a unique NCP-map σ : P(cid:48) → B(K )
with σ ◦ρ(cid:48) = π and AdV ◦σ = f (cid:48). The uniqueness of σ follows by
the same reasoning we used to show that AdS1 = AdS2 in Propo-
sition 13. To show such σ exists, let (K (cid:48),π(cid:48),V (cid:48)) be a minimal
normal Stinespring dilation of f (cid:48). Note that (K (cid:48),π(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48),V (cid:48)) is a
normal Stinespring dilation of ϕ. Thus, by Proposition 13, there
is a (unique) isometry S: K → K (cid:48) such that SV = V (cid:48) and AdS◦π(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = π. Deﬁne σ ≡ AdS◦π(cid:48).
Clearly σ ◦ ρ(cid:48) = Ads◦π(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = π and AdV ◦σ = AdV ◦AdS◦π(cid:48) = AdV(cid:48) ◦π(cid:48) = f (cid:48), as desired.

2 Existence of the Paschke Dilation

We will show that every NCP-map ϕ between von Neumann algebras has a Paschke dilation, see The-
orem 18. For this we employ the theory of self-dual Hilbert B-modules — developed by Paschke —
which are, roughly speaking, Hilbert spaces in which the ﬁeld of complex numbers has been replaced by
a von Neumann algebra B. Nowadays, the more general (not necessarily self-dual) Hilbert B-modules,
where B is a C∗-algebra, have become more prominent, and so it seems appropriate to point out from the
get–go that both self-duality and the fact that B is a von Neumann algebra (also a type of self-duality,
by the way) seem to be essential in the proof of Theorem 18.

We review the deﬁnitions and results we need from the theory of self-dual Hilbert B-modules.

Overview 16. Let B be a von Neumann algebra.

1. A pre-Hilbert B-module X (see Def. 2.1 of [Pas73]2) is a right B-module equipped with a B-
valued inner product, that is, a map (cid:104)· , ·(cid:105) : X × X → B such that, for all x,y,y(cid:48) ∈ X and b ∈ B,
(a) (cid:104)x, (y + y(cid:48))b(cid:105) = (cid:104)x,y(cid:105)b +(cid:104)x,y(cid:48)(cid:105)b;
(b) (cid:104)x,x(cid:105) ≥ 0 and (cid:104)x,x(cid:105) = 0 iff x = 0;

(c) (cid:104)x,y(cid:105)∗

= (cid:104)y,x(cid:105).

2. A Hilbert B-module (see Def. 2.4 of [Pas73]) is a pre-Hilbert B-module X which is complete

with respect to the norm (cid:107) · (cid:107) on X given by (cid:107)x(cid:107) =(cid:112)(cid:107)(cid:104)x,x(cid:105)(cid:107).

3. A Hilbert B-module X is self-dual (see §3 of [Pas73]) if every bounded module map τ : X → B

is of the form τ = (cid:104)x, ·(cid:105) for some x ∈ X.

4. Self-duality is essential for the following result. Let T : X → Y be a bounded module map between
Hilbert B-modules. If X is self-dual, then it is ‘adjointable’; that is: there is a unique bounded
module map T ∗ : Y → X, called the adjoint of T , with (cid:104)T x,y(cid:105) = (cid:104)x,T ∗y(cid:105) for all x ∈ X and y ∈ Y
(see Prop. 3.4 of [Pas73]).

5. Let X be a pre-Hilbert B-module. One can extend X to a self-dual Hilbert B-module as follows.
The set X(cid:48) of bounded module maps from τ : X → B is called the dual of X, and is a B-module
via (τ · b)(x) = b∗ · τ(x) (see line 4 of p. 450 of [Pas73]). Note that X sits inside X(cid:48) via the
injective module map x (cid:55)→ ˆx ≡ (cid:104)x, ·(cid:105). In fact, X(cid:48) can be equipped with an B-valued inner product
that makes X(cid:48) into a self-dual Hilbert B-module with (cid:104)τ, ˆx(cid:105) = τ(x) for all τ ∈ X(cid:48) and x ∈ X (see
Thm. 3.2 of [Pas73]).

6. Any bounded module map T : X → Y between pre-Hilbert B-modules has a unique extension to a

bounded module map ˜T : X(cid:48) → Y (cid:48) (see Prop. 3.6 of [Pas73]).
It follows that any bounded module map T : X → Y from a pre-Hilbert B-module into a self-dual
Hilbert B-module has a unique extension T : X(cid:48) → Y .

2Although in [Pas73] (cid:104)x,y(cid:105) is linear in x and anti-linear in y, we have chosen to adopt the now dominant convention that

(cid:104)x,y(cid:105) is anti-linear in x and linear in y.

7. Let X be a self-dual Hilbert B-module. The set Ba(X) of bounded module maps on X forms a von
Neumann algebra (see Prop. 3.10 of [Pas73]).3 Addition and scalar multiplication are computed
coordinate-wise in Ba(X); multiplication is given by composition, and involution is the adjoint.
An element t of Ba(X) is positive iff (cid:104)x,x(cid:105) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ X (see Lem 4.1 of [Lan95]). If X happens
to be the dual of a pre-Hilbert B-module X0, then we even have t ≥ 0 iff (cid:104)x,tx(cid:105) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ X0.
It follows that T ∗T is positive in Ba(X) for any bounded module map T : X → Y .
We will also need the fact that (cid:104)x, (· )x(cid:105) : Ba(X)→ B is normal for every x∈ X, which follows from
the observation that f ((cid:104)x, (· )x(cid:105)): Ba(X) → C is normal for every positive normal map f : B → C,
which in turn follows form the description of the predual of Ba(X) in Proposition 3.10 of [Pas73].
Deﬁnition 17. Let ϕ : A → B be an NCP-map between von Neumann algebras. A complex bilinear
map of the form B: A × B → X, where X is a self-dual Hilbert B-module, is called ϕ-compatible if,
there is r > 0 such that, for all a1, . . . ,an ∈ A and b1, . . . ,bn ∈ B,

and B(a,b1)b2 = B(a,b1b2) for all a ∈ A and b1,b2 ∈ B.
Theorem 18. Let ϕ : A → B be an NCP-map between von Neumann algebras.

1. There is a self-dual Hilbert B-module A ⊗ϕ B and a ϕ-compatible bilinear map

⊗: A × B → A ⊗ϕ B

such that for every ϕ-compatible bilinear map B: A × B → Y there is a unique bounded module
map T : A ⊗ϕ B −→ Y such that T (a⊗ b) = B(a,b) for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B.

2. For every a0 ∈ A there is a unique bounded module map ρ(a0) on A ⊗ϕ B given by

ρ(a0)(a⊗ b) = (a0a)⊗ b,

and the assignment a (cid:55)→ ρ(a) yields an NMIU-map ρ : A → Ba(A ⊗ϕ B).

3. The assignment T (cid:55)→ (cid:104)1⊗ 1,T (1⊗ 1)(cid:105) gives an NCP-map f : Ba(A ⊗ϕ B) −→ B.
4. A ρ

Proof. (1) To construct A ⊗ϕ B, we follow the lines of Theorem 5.2 of [Pas73], and start with the
algebraic tensor product, A (cid:12) B, whose elements are ﬁnite sums of the form ∑i ai ⊗ bi, and which is a
right B-module via (∑i ai ⊗ bi)β = ∑i ai ⊗ (biβ ). If we deﬁne [· , · ] on A (cid:12) B by

we get a B-valued semi-inner product on A (cid:12) B, and a (proper) B-valued inner product on the quotient
X0 = (A (cid:12) B)/N, where N = {x ∈ A (cid:12) B : [x,x] = 0}, so that X0 is a pre-Hilbert B-module. (That N is
a submodule of A (cid:12) B is not entirely obvious, see Remark 2.2 of [Pas73].) Now, deﬁne A ⊗ϕ B := X(cid:48)
0 is the dual of X0 from Overview 16(5)), and let ⊗: A × B → A ⊗ϕ B be given by a⊗ b =
(where X(cid:48)
(cid:92)a⊗ b + N. Then A ⊗ϕ B is a self-dual Hilbert B-module, and ⊗ is a ϕ-compatible bilinear map.
3The superscript a in Ba(X) stands for adjointable, which is automatic for bounded module-maps on a self-dual X.

Paschke Dilations

Let B: A × B → Y be a ϕ-compatible bilinear map to some self-dual Hilbert B-module Y . We must
show that there is a unique bounded module map T : A ⊗ϕ B → Y such that T (a⊗ b) = B(a,b). By
Overview 16(6), it sufﬁces to show that there is a unique bounded module map T : X0 → Y with T (a⊗
b) = B(a,b). Since A (cid:12)B is generated by elements of the form a⊗b, uniqueness is obvious. Concerning
existence, there is a (unique) linear map S: A (cid:12)B → X with S(a⊗b) = B(a,b) by the universal property
of the algebraic tensor product. Note that the kernel of S contains N, because if x = ∑i ai ⊗ bi is from N,
i a j)b j = 0, and so (cid:107)S(x)(cid:107) ≡ (cid:107)∑i B(ai,bi)(cid:107) = 0 by Equation (2). Thus there is a
then [x,x] = ∑i, j b∗
unique linear map T : X0 → Y with T (a⊗ b) = B(a,b). By Equation (2), T is bounded. Finally, since
B(a,bβ ) = B(a,b)β , it is easy to see that S and T are module maps.
(2) Let a0 ∈ A be given. To obtain the bounded module map ρ(a0) on A ⊗ϕ B, it sufﬁces to show
the bilinear map B: A × B → A ⊗ϕ B given by B(a,b) = (a0a)⊗ b is ϕ-compatible. It is easy to see
that B(a,b)β = B(a,bβ ). Concerning Equation (2), let a1, . . . ,an ∈ A and b1, . . . ,bn ∈ B be given. Then
we have, writing a for the row vector (a1···an), b for the column vector (b1···bn),

Thus B is ϕ-compatible, and so there is a unique bounded module map ρ(a0): A ⊗ϕ B −→ A ⊗ϕ B
with ρ(a0)(a⊗ b) = (a0a)⊗ b. Since it is easy to see that a0 (cid:55)→ ρ(a0) gives a multiplicative involutive
unital linear map ρ : A → Ba(A ⊗ϕ B), the only thing left to prove is that ρ is normal.
Let D be a bounded directed set of self-adjoint elements of A . To show that ρ is normal, we
must prove that ρ(supD) = supd∈D ρ(d). It sufﬁces to show that (cid:104)x,ρ(supD)x(cid:105) = (cid:104)x,supd∈D ρ(d)x(cid:105) for
all x ∈ X0. Let x ∈ X0 be given and write x = ∑i ai ⊗ bi, where a1, . . . ,an ∈ A and b1, . . . ,bn ∈ A . Then,
if a stands for the row vector (a1···an) and b is the column vector (b1, . . . ,bn), we have

(4) To begin, note that ( f ◦ ρ)(a) = (cid:104)1⊗ 1,a⊗ 1(cid:105) = ϕ(a) for all a ∈ A , and so ϕ = f ◦ ρ.
Suppose that ϕ factors as A ρ(cid:48)

/ B , where P(cid:48) is a von Neumann algebra, ρ(cid:48) is an
NMIU-map, and f (cid:48) is an NCP-map. We must show that there is a unique NCP-map σ : P(cid:48) → Ba(A ⊗ϕ

(Uniqueness) Let σ1,σ2 : P → Ba(A ⊗ϕ B) be NCP-maps with f ◦ σk = f (cid:48) and σk ◦ ρ(cid:48) = ρ. We
must show that σ1 = σ2. Let c ∈ P(cid:48) and x ∈ X0 be given. It sufﬁces to prove that (cid:104)x,σ1(c)x(cid:105) = (cid:104)x,σ2(c)x(cid:105)

Hence (cid:104)x,σ1(x)(cid:105) = (cid:104)x,σ2(x)(cid:105), and so σ1 = σ2.
(Existence) Recall that each self-adjoint bounded operator A on Hilbert space H gives a bounded
quadratic form x (cid:55)→ (cid:104)x,Ax(cid:105), that every quadratic form arises in this way, and that the operator A can be
reconstructed from its quadratic form. One can develop a similar correspondence in the case of Hilbert
B-modules, which can be used to deﬁne σ from Equation (3). We will, however, give a shorter proof of
the existence of σ, which was suggested to us by Michael Skeide.
The trick is to see that the construction that gave us A ⊗ϕ B may also be applied to f (cid:48) : P(cid:48) →
/ B . It sufﬁces to ﬁnd an NCP-map σ(cid:48) : Ba(P(cid:48) ⊗ f (cid:48)
B yielding maps P(cid:48)
B) −→ Ba(A ⊗ϕ B) with f (cid:48)(cid:48) = f ◦ σ(cid:48) and ρ = σ(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48)(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) for then σ = σ(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48)(cid:48) will have the desired
properties.
Let S: A ⊗ϕ B −→ P(cid:48)⊗ f (cid:48) B be the bounded module map given by S(a⊗b) = ρ(cid:48)(a)⊗b, which ex-
ists by part 1, because a straightforward computation shows that (a,b) (cid:55)→ ρ(cid:48)(a)⊗b gives a ϕ-compatible
bilinear map A × B −→ P(cid:48) ⊗ f (cid:48) B. We claim that σ(cid:48) = S∗(· )S ﬁts the bill.
Let us begin by proving that σ(cid:48)(1) ≡ S∗S = 1. Let x ∈ X0. It sufﬁces to show that (cid:104)x,S∗Sx(cid:105) = (cid:104)x,x(cid:105).
Writing x ≡ ∑i ai ⊗ bi, we have (cid:104)x,S∗Sx(cid:105) = (cid:104)Sx,Sx(cid:105) = ∑i, j b∗
i a j)b j =
(cid:104)x,x(cid:105), because ρ(cid:48) is multiplicative and f (cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = ϕ. Thus S∗S = 1.
Note that σ(cid:48) is completely positive, because for all s1, . . . ,sn ∈ Ba(P(cid:48)⊗ f (cid:48) B) and t1, . . . ,tn ∈ Ba(A ⊗ϕ
B), we have ∑i, j t∗
Let x ∈ A ⊗ϕ B be given. Note that (cid:104)x,σ(cid:48)(· )x(cid:105) = (cid:104)Sx, (· )Sx(cid:105) is normal. From this it follows that σ(cid:48)
is normal (in the same way we proved that ρ is normal in (2)).
Since from S(1 ⊗ 1) = ρ(1) ⊗ 1 = 1 ⊗ 1 it swiftly follows that f ◦ σ(cid:48) = f (cid:48)(cid:48), the only thing left to
show is that ρ = σ(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48)(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48). Let a,a0 ∈ A and b ∈ B be given. By point (1), it sufﬁces to show
that ρ(a0)(a⊗ b) = σ(cid:48)(ρ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ρ(cid:48)(a0)))(a⊗ b). Unfolding gives σ(cid:48)(ρ(cid:48)(cid:48)(ρ(cid:48)(a0)))(a⊗ b) = S∗(ρ(cid:48)(a0a)⊗ b) =
S∗S(ρ(a0)(a⊗ b)), but we already saw that S∗S = 1, and so we are done.

3 Pure maps

Schr¨odinger’s equation is invariant under the reversal of time, and so any isolated purely quantum me-
chanical process is invertible. However, NCP-maps include non-invertible processes such as measure-
ment and discarding. However, not all is lost, for a broad class of processes is pure enough to be
‘reversed’, e.g. (AdV )† = AdV∗. In fact, the Stinespring dilation theorem states that every NCP-map
into B(H ) factors as a reversible AdV , after a (possibly) non-reversible NMIU-map.

In this section we study two seemingly unrelated deﬁnitions of pure (i.e. reversible) for arbitrary
NCP-maps. The ﬁrst is a direct generalization of AdV , and the second uses the Paschke dilation. Both
deﬁnitions turn out to be equivalent.
Before we continue, let’s rule out two alternative deﬁnitions of pure. 1. Recall a state ϕ : A →
C is called pure, if is an extreme point among all states. It does not make sense to deﬁne an NCP-
map to be pure if it is extreme, because every NMIU-map is extreme (among the unital NCP-maps).
2. Inspired by the GNS-correspondence between pure states and irreducible representations, Størmer
deﬁnes a map ϕ : A → B(H ) to be pure if the only maps below ϕ in the completely positive order
are scalar multiples of ϕ. One can show that the Størmer pure NCP-maps between B(H ) → B(K )
are exactly those of the form AdV , see Prop. 34. In a non-factor every central element gives a different
completely positive map below the identity and so if one generalizes Størmer’s deﬁnition to arbitrary
NCP-maps, the identity need not be pure.

Paschke Dilations

Now, let us sketch our ﬁrst deﬁnition of pure. Consider V : K → H . By polar decomposition we
may factor V = UA, where A: K → r(A)H is a positive map and U : r(A)H → K is an isometry
and so AdV = AdA◦AdU. The pure maps AdA and AdU are of a particularly simple form. We will see
they admit a dual universal property, the ﬁrst is (up to scaling) a compression and the second a corner
(Def. 19). This allows us to generalize the notion of pure to arbitrary NCP-maps (Def. 21). We show
maps on the right-hand side of a Paschke dilation are pure. Then we will show the main result of the
section: an NCP-map is pure if and only if the map on the left-hand side of its Paschke dilation is
surjective. As a corollary, we show both the left- and right-hand side of a Paschke dilation are extreme
among the maps with the same value on 1.
Deﬁnition 19. Let a be an element of a von Neumann algebra A with 0 ≤ a ≤ 1.

1. The least projection above a, we call the support projection of a, and we denote it as (cid:100)a(cid:101). Its de
Morgan dual (cid:98)a(cid:99) ≡ 1−(cid:100)1− a(cid:101) is the greatest projection below a. For any projection p, write Cp
for the central carrier, that is: the least central projection above p (see e.g. [KR97, Def. 5.5.1]).
2. For an NCP-map ϕ : A → B, we write carϕ for the carrier of ϕ, the least projection of A such
that ϕ(carϕ) = ϕ(1). The map ϕ is said to be faithful if carϕ = 1. Equivalently, ϕ is faithful
if ϕ(a∗a) = 0 implies a∗a = 0 for all a ∈ A .
3. We call the map ha : A → (cid:98)a(cid:99)A (cid:98)a(cid:99) given by b (cid:55)→ (cid:98)a(cid:99)b(cid:98)a(cid:99), the standard corner of a.
4. We call the map ca : (cid:100)a(cid:101)A (cid:100)a(cid:101) → A given by b (cid:55)→ √
5. A contractive NCP-map h: A → B is said to be a corner for an a ∈ [0,1]A if h(a) = h(1) and for
every (other) contractive NCP-map f : A → C with f (a) = f (1), there is a unique f (cid:48) : B → C
with f = f (cid:48) ◦ h.

√
a, the standard compression of a.

6. A contractive NCP-map c: B → A is said to be a compression for an a ∈ [0,1]A if c(1) = a and
for every (other) contractive NCP-map g: C → A with g(1) ≤ a, there is a unique g(cid:48) : C → B
with g = c◦ g(cid:48).

Proposition 20. Let A be any von Neumann algebra with effect a ∈ [0,1]A .

1. The standard corner ha is a corner for a and the standard compression ca is a compression for a.
2. Corners are surjective. Compressions are injective. Restricted to self-adjoint elements, compres-

sions are order-embeddings.

3. Every corner h for a is of the form h = ϑ ◦ ha for some isomorphism ϑ. Every compression c for a

is of the form c = ca ◦ ϑ for some isomorphism ϑ.

4. Assume ϕ : A → B is a contractive NCP-map. Let ϕ(cid:48) denote the unique contractive NCP-map
such that cϕ(1) ◦ ϕ(cid:48) = ϕ and ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48) the unique contractive NCP-map with ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48) ◦ hcarϕ = ϕ. Then ϕ(cid:48) is
unital and ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48) is faithful.

5. With ϕ as above, there is a unique NCP-map ϕ(cid:93) : (carϕ)A (carϕ) → (cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101)B(cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101) such

that cϕ(1) ◦ ϕ(cid:93) ◦ hcarϕ = ϕ. The map ϕ(cid:93) is faithful and unital.

Proof. See appendix.

In the previous Deﬁnition and Proposition we chose to restrict ourselves to contractive maps as a ‘non-
contractive compression’ might sound confusing. For a non-contractive ϕ, deﬁne ϕ(cid:93) := ( 1(cid:107)ϕ(cid:107) · ϕ)(cid:93).
Deﬁnition 21. A NCP-map ϕ : A → B is said to be pure whenever ϕ(cid:93) is an isomorphism.

Example 22. The pure NCP-maps between B(H ) and B(K ) are exactly those of the form AdV for
some V : K → H . The contractive pure maps are exactly those with V ∗V ≤ 1.
Example 23. If ϕ : A → B is unital and faithful, then ϕ(cid:93) = ϕ. Thus a state is pure if and only if it is
faithful. Also isomorphisms are pure.
Proposition 24. Corners, compressions and pure maps are closed under composition.

Proof. See appendix.

Remark 25. On the category of von Neumann algebra with pure maps, one may deﬁne a dagger which
turns it into a dagger category. It is not directly clear it is unique, but with additional assumptions is can
be shown to be unique. This is beyond the scope of this paper and will appear elsewhere.

Proof. Let A ρ
plan is to ﬁrst prove that A ⊗hp pA p can be identiﬁed with A p, and then to show that Ba(A p) = CpA .
Note that A p is a right pA p-module by (ap) · (pbp) = apbp, and a pre-Hilbert pA p-module
via (cid:104)ap,α p(cid:105) = pa∗α p. Since by the C∗-identity the norm on A p as a pre-Hilbert B-module coin-
cides with the norm of A p as subset of the von C∗-algebra A , and A p is norm closed in A , and A is
norm complete, we see that A p is complete, and thus a Hilbert pA p-module.
The next step is to show that A p is self-dual. Let τ : A p → pA p be a bounded pA p-module map.
We must ﬁnd α p ∈ A p with τ(ap) = pα∗ap for all a ∈ A . This requires some effort.
1. We claim that Cp = sup{r : r (cid:46) p}, where r (cid:46) p denotes that r is a projection which is von
Neumann-Murray below p, i.e. r = vv∗ and v∗v ≤ p for some v ∈ A , see [KR97, Def. 6.2.1].
To begin, writing q = sup{r : r (cid:46) p}, we have Cq = Cp. Indeed, since p (cid:46) p, we have p ≤ q,
and so Cp ≤ Cq. For the other direction, Cq ≤ Cp, note that if r is a projection with r (cid:46) p,
then r ≤ Cr ≤ Cp by [KR97, Prop. 6.2.8]. Thus q ≤ Cp, and so Cq ≤ Cp.
Thus we must prove that Cq − q = 0.
It sufﬁces to show that CCq−q = 0. Note that for every
projection r with r ≤ Cq− q and r (cid:46) p we have r = 0, because r (cid:46) p implies r ≤ q and so 2r ≤ Cq.
Thus, by [KR97, Prop. 6.1.8], we get CCq−qCp = 0. But since Cq − q ≤ Cq = Cp, we have CCq−q ≤
Cp, and so CCq−q = CCq−qCp = 0.
2. Using Zorn’s lemma, we can ﬁnd a family (qi)i∈I of pairwise orthogonal projections in A with
qi (cid:46) p and Cp ≡ q = ∑i∈I qi.
(Here, and in the remainder of this proof, inﬁnite sums in von
Neumann algebras are taken with respect to the ultraweak topology.) For each i ∈ I, pick vi ∈ A
i vi p⊥ ≤ p⊥ pp⊥ = 0, we have vi p⊥ = 0 by the C∗-identity,
with viv∗
and so vi ∈ A p for all i ∈ I.

then for any normal state ω on pA p we have

6. Pick any ap ∈ A p. As q = supi qi, we have q = ∑i qi ultrastrongly (combine [KR97, Lemma 5.1.4]

with [Sak12, Prop. 1.15.2]), and thus τ(qap) = ∑i τ(qiap) ultraweakly. Hence

where we use that qap = ap (since q = Cp), and qi = q2
i . Thus A p is self-dual.
Now we will show A p is isomorphic to A ⊗hp pA p. Note [ap⊗ p,ap⊗ p] = pa∗ap and so ap⊗
p ∈ N if and only if ap = 0. A straight-forward computation shows a⊗ pα p− apα p⊗ p ∈ N and so
every x ∈ A (cid:12) pA p is N-equivalent to exactly one ap⊗ p for some a ∈ A . Thus ap⊗ p + N (cid:55)→ ap ﬁxes
an isomorphism X0 → A p. As A p is already complete and self-dual, so is X0. Hence via ap (cid:55)→ (cid:92)ap⊗ p
we have A p ∼= X0 ∼= X ∼= X(cid:48) ≡ A ⊗hp pA p and so A ρ
/ pA p is a Paschke dilation
for hp, where ρ(α)ap = αap and f (t) = pt(p).
If in the proof above — that τ ≡ α∗(· )p for some α ∈ A p — we replace τ by a bounded pA p-
module map t : A p → A p, then the reasoning is still valid (except for point (4)), and so we see that the
map ρ : A → Ba(A p) given by ρ(α0)(ap) = α0ap is surjective.
Now we show carρ = Cp. It is sufﬁcient to show that for each α ≥ 0 with α ∈ A , we have that αap =
0 for all a ∈ A if and only if αCp = 0. The reverse direction follows from αap = α(1−Cp)ap = 0
whenever αCp = 0. Thus assume αap = 0 for all a ∈ A . In particular 0 = αvi pv∗
i = αqi and so αCp =
αq = ∑i αqi = 0, as desired. We now know ρ = ϑ ◦ hCp for some isomorphism ϑ : Ba(A p) → CpA . It
is easy to see f ◦ ϑ−1 = hp and so we have proven our Theorem.

sume t ∈ Z(CpA ) such that pt p = 0. Then 0 = r(pt) = pr(t) and so p ≤ 1 − r(t). As 1 − r(t) is a
central projection, we must have 1− r(t) ≤ Cp = 1CpA . Hence r(t) = 0 and so t = 0. We are done.
Problem 33. Is every NCP-extreme NCP-map either pure or a compression after an NMIU-map?

Remarks

The construction of the standard Paschke dilation is a generalization of the GNS-construction to Hilbert
C∗-modules. For this reason, for those studying C∗-modules, the construction is known as Paschke’s
GNS (e.g. [Ske00, Remark 8.4]). There is also a generalization of Stinespring to C∗-modules due to
Kasparov.[Kas80] This Theorem, however, is like Stinespring only applicable to NCP-maps of which
the codomain has a certain form and hence as far as it applies to arbitrary NCP-maps, it reduces to
Paschke.

Appendix
Proof of Lemma 9. There are unique mediating maps σ1 : P1 → P2 and σ2 : P2 → P1. It is easy to
see σ1 ◦ σ2 satisﬁes the same property as the unique mediating map id: P1 → P1 and so σ1 ◦ σ2 = id.
Similarly σ2◦σ1 = id. Deﬁne ϑ = σ1. We just saw ϑ is an NCP-isomorphism. Note ϑ (1) = ϑ (ρ1(1)) =
ρ2(1) = 1 and so ϑ is unital. But then by [WW16, Corollary 47] ϑ is an NMIU isomorphism.
Proof of Lemma 12. Let x ∈ K be given, and let P be the projection onto {λ x: λ ∈ C}. Then

{λ S∗x: λ ∈ C} = Ran( S∗PS ) = Ran( T ∗PT ) = {λ T ∗x: λ ∈ C}.

It follows that S∗x = αT ∗x for some α ∈ C with α (cid:54)= 0. While α might depend on x, there is α0 ∈ C
with α0 (cid:54)= 0 and S∗ = α0T ∗ by Lemma 9 of [WW16]. Then S = α∗
Proof of Proposition 20. The proposition is true in greater generality.[CJWW15] We give a direct proof.

2. Let c: A → B be any compression. Assume a,a(cid:48) ∈ A are self-adjoint elements with c(a) ≤ c(a(cid:48)).
Without loss of generality, we may assume a,a(cid:48) ≥ 0 as (cid:107)a(cid:107) + a,(cid:107)a(cid:107) + a(cid:48) ≥ 0. Deﬁne pα : C → B
by pα (1) = α for α ∈ A . Note 0 ≤ c(a(cid:48) − a) ≤ c(1) and so by the universal property of c, there is
a unique map f (cid:48) : C → A with c◦ f (cid:48) = pc(a(cid:48)−a). We compute

and so by the universal property of c, we have p 1
corollary, c is injective on self-adjoint elements. It follows c is injective. (See e.g. [Cho16, Proof
Lemma 4.2]). Clearly isomorphisms and a standard corner are surjective. Thus by point 3, every
corner is surjective.

2 a(cid:48) = p 1

3. A standard argument gives us that there are mediating NCP-isomorphisms. They are actual NMIU-

isomorphisms by e.g. [WW16, Corollary 47].

4. Write uA : C → A for the NCP-map uA (λ ) = λ · 1. Then ϕ ◦ uA = cϕ(1) ◦ ϕ(cid:48) ◦ uA = cϕ(1) ◦
u(cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101)B(cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101) and so by the universal property of cϕ(1), we get ϕ(cid:48) ◦ uA = u(cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101)B(cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101) and
so 1 = ϕ(cid:48)(1), as desired. Write p ≡ carϕ. Now, to show ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48) is faithful, assume ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48)(pap) = 0 for
some pap ∈ [0,1]pA p. Then 0 = ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48)(pap) = ϕ(cid:48)(cid:48)(hp(pap)) = ϕ(pap) and so pap ≤ 1− carϕ =
1− p. Hence pap = 0, as desired.

5. By point 2, we know ϕ(cid:93) is unique. Note cϕ(1) ◦ ϕ(cid:93)(1) = ϕ(1) and car(ϕ(cid:93) ◦ hcarϕ ) = carϕ and so

ϕ(cid:93) is unital and faithful by the previous point.

Proof of Proposition 24. First we show corners are closed under composition. Let h: A → B be a
corner for a and h(cid:48) : B → C be a corner for b. There is a unique isomorphism ϑ : (cid:98)a(cid:99)A (cid:98)a(cid:99) → B
such that h = ϑ ◦ h(cid:98)a(cid:99). Note h(cid:98)a(cid:99) ◦ c(cid:98)a(cid:99) = id and so h ◦ c(cid:98)a(cid:99) ◦ ϑ−1 = id. We will show h(cid:48) ◦ h is a
corner for c(cid:98)a(cid:99)(ϑ−1((cid:98)b(cid:99))). To this end, assume g: A → D is any contractive NCP-map for which it
holds g(c(cid:98)a(cid:99)(ϑ−1((cid:98)b(cid:99)))) = g(1). Clearly g(1) = g(c(cid:98)a(cid:99)(ϑ−1((cid:98)b(cid:99)))) = g(1) ≤ g((cid:98)a(cid:99)) ≤ g(1) and so by
the universal property of h, there is a unique contractive NCP-map g(cid:48) : B → D such that g(cid:48)◦ h = g. Now

g(cid:48)((cid:98)b(cid:99)) = g(cid:48)(h(c(cid:98)a(cid:99)(ϑ−1((cid:98)b(cid:99))))) = g(c(cid:98)a(cid:99)(ϑ−1((cid:98)b(cid:99)))) = g(1) = g(cid:48)(h(1)) = g(cid:48)(1)

and so by the universal property of h(cid:48) there is a unique contractive NCP-map g(cid:48)(cid:48) : C → D with g(cid:48)(cid:48)◦h(cid:48) = g(cid:48).
Clearly g(cid:48)(cid:48) ◦ h(cid:48) ◦ h = g. It is easy to see g(cid:48)(cid:48) is unique.
We continue with compressions. Assume c: C → B is a compression for b and c(cid:48) : B → A is
a compression for a. We will show c(cid:48) ◦ c is a compression for c(cid:48)(b). To this end, let g: D → A be
any contractive NCP-map such that g(1) ≤ c(cid:48)(b). As g(1) ≤ c(cid:48)(b) ≤ a, there is a unique g(cid:48) : D → B
with c(cid:48) ◦ g(cid:48) = g. Clearly c(cid:48)(g(cid:48)(1)) = g(1) ≤ c(cid:48)(b). Thus g(cid:48)(1) ≤ b and so there is a unique contractive
NCP-map g(cid:48)(cid:48) : D → C such that c◦ g(cid:48)(cid:48) = g(cid:48). Now c(cid:48) ◦ c◦ g(cid:48)(cid:48) = g It is easy to see g(cid:48)(cid:48) is unique.

To show pure maps are closed under composi-
tion, it is sufﬁcient to show that hp ◦ ca is pure for
any von Neumann algebra A , projection p ∈ A and
effect a ∈ [0,1]A . To this end, we will deﬁne a u such
that the diagram on the right makes sense, commutes
and Adu is an isomorphism. First some facts.

Consequently hp ◦ ca is pure.
Proof of Proposition 26. Assume P(cid:48) is any von Neumann algebra together with NMIU-map ρ(cid:48) : A →
P(cid:48) and NCP-map f (cid:48) : P(cid:48) → B such that f (cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = c◦ ϕ. Note f (cid:48)(1) = f (cid:48)(ρ(cid:48)(1)) = c(ϕ(1)) ≤ c(1) ≤ b.
Hence there is a unique NCP-map f (cid:48)(cid:48) : P(cid:48) → B(cid:48) with c◦ f (cid:48)(cid:48) = f (cid:48). Observe c◦ f (cid:48)(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = f (cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = c◦ ϕ
and so f (cid:48)(cid:48) ◦ ρ(cid:48) = ϕ as c is injective. There is a unique σ : P(cid:48) → P with σ ◦ ρ(cid:48) = ρ and f ◦ σ = f (cid:48)(cid:48). But
then c◦ f ◦ σ = c◦ f (cid:48)(cid:48) = f (cid:48) and so we have shown existence of a mediating map. To show uniqueness,
assume σ(cid:48) : P(cid:48) → P is any NCP-map such that c◦ f ◦ σ(cid:48) = f (cid:48) and σ ◦ ρ(cid:48) = ρ. Clearly c◦ f ◦ σ(cid:48) = f (cid:48) =
c◦ f (cid:48)(cid:48) and so f ◦ σ(cid:48) = f (cid:48)(cid:48). Thus σ = σ(cid:48) by deﬁnition of σ.
Proof of Corollary 27. First, we will prove that if ϕ is unital, then f is a corner. Thus, assume ϕ is
/ B be the standard Paschke dilation of ϕ. By [Pas73, Corollary 5.3], fs
unital. Let A ρs
is a corner. By Lemma 9, we have f = fs ◦ ϑ for some isomorphism ϑ. But then f is also a corner.
Now, we will prove that for arbitrary contractive ϕ, the map f is pure and contractive. The non-
contractive case follows by scaling. Write ϕ(cid:48) : A → (cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101)B(cid:100)ϕ(1)(cid:101) for the unique unital NCP-map

such that ϕ = cϕ(1) ◦ ϕ(cid:48). Let A ρ(cid:48)
By Proposition 26, A ρ(cid:48)
know f = cϕ(1) ◦ f (cid:48) ◦ ϑ for some isomorphism ϑ. As these are all pure, f is pure as well.
Proof of Corollary 29. Assume ρ is surjective. The kernel of ρ is zA for some central projection z.
(See e.g. [Sak12, 1.10.5].) Note the quotient-map for the kernel of ρ is a corner for z, hence by the
isomorphism theorem ρ is a corner. By Corollary 27 f is pure. Thus ϕ is the composition of pure maps
and hence pure.
Now assume ϕ is pure. By scaling, we may assume ϕ is contractive. Write p ≡ carϕ. Note ϕ = c◦hp

Proposition 34. Let ϕ : A → B(H ) be any NCP-map. Then ϕ is pure in the deﬁnition of Størmer
[Stø12, Def. 3.5.4] if and only if ϕ is pure as in Def. 21.
Proof. Let ϕ : A → B(H ) be any NCP-map with standard Paschke dilation A ρ
/ P f
/ B(H ) .
Note that by Theorem 14, we know P ∼= B(K ) for some Hilbert space K and so it is a factor.
Assume ϕ : A → B(H ) is pure as in Def. 21. Let ψ : A → B(H ) with ϕ −ψ completely positive.
To show ϕ is pure in the sense of Størmer, we have to show ψ = λϕ for some λ ∈ [0,1]. By [Pas73,
Prop. 5.4], ψ = ϕt for some t ∈ ρ(A )(cid:48) with 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. In particular ψ is normal. As ϕ is pure we know
by Corollary 29 that ρ is surjective. Thus ρ(A )(cid:48) = Z(P) = C1. Thus t = λ 1 for some λ ∈ [0,1]. We
conclude ψ = ϕt = ϕλ 1 = λϕ1 = λϕ as desired.

t (1) is as ϑ−1 is injective.

, which proves 1.

For the converse, assume ϕ is Størmer pure. By Corollary 29, it is sufﬁcient to show ρ is surjec-
tive. As ρ(A ) is a von Neumann subalgebra of P, we may conclude that ρ is surjective if we can
show ρ(A )(cid:48) ⊆ Z(P) as P = Z(P)(cid:48) ⊆ ρ(A )(cid:48)(cid:48) = ρ(A ) ⊆ P by the double commutant theorem. To
this end, let t ∈ ρ(A )(cid:48). Without loss of generality, we may assume 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Then ϕt ∈ [0,1]NCP and
so ϕt = λϕ for some λ ∈ [0,1]. Hence ϕt = λϕ = ϕλ 1 and so t = λ 1 ∈ Z(P), which completes the
proof.
