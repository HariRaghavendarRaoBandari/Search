A CASTELNUOVO-MUMFORD REGULARITY BOUND FOR SCROLLS

WENBO NIU AND JINHYUNG PARK

Dedicated to Professor Lawrence Ein on the occation of his sixtieth birthday.

Abstract. Let X ⊂ Pr be a scroll of codimension e and degree d over a smooth projective curve of genus
g. The purpose of this paper is to prove a linear regularity bound that reg(X) ≤ d− e + 1 + g(e− 1). This
bound is slightly worse than the conjectured one due to Eisenbud and Goto, but it works for arbitrary
dimension scrolls deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of any characteristic.

1. Introduction

Throughout the paper, we work over an algebraically closed ﬁeld k of arbitrary characteristic. Let X ⊂ Pr
be a projective variety deﬁned by an ideal sheaf IX . We say that X is m-regular if H i(Pr, IX (m−i)) = 0
for all i > 0. The minimal such number is called the Castelnuovo-Mumford reguarity of X and is denoted
by reg(X). It has attracted considerable attentions to establish bounds for reg(X) in terms of geometric
or algebraic invariants. One optimal regularity bound has been conjectured as follows:
Conjecture 1.1 (Eisenbud-Goto [EG]). Let X ⊂ Pr be a non-degenerate projective variety of codimen-
sion e and degree d. Then one has

reg(X) ≤ d − e + 1.

The conjecture has only been proven for integral curves by [GLP] and for smooth complex surfaces
by [P] and [L1]. Slightly weaker results for lower dimensional smooth varieties in characteristic zero
were obtained in [K1] and [K2]. The case of nonsingular scroll varieties of arbitrary dimension, which
perhaps the ﬁrst reasonable case of higher dimensional varieties that one should check, was claimed in
[B, Theorem 3]. However, the proof in [B] contains a miscalculation which oversimpliﬁed the problem
(see Remark 3.3 for details).

Motivated by the work of [GLP] and [B], we are trying to complete Bertin’s work on a regularity
bound for a scroll in this paper. To state our result, we need some notations ﬁrst. Let C be a smooth
projective curve of genus g ≥ 0, and E be a very ample vector bundle of rank n and degree d on C. We
have a natural projection t : P(E) −→ C. Consider a base-point-free subspace V ⊂ H 0(P(E), OP(E)(1))
which gives an embedding p : P(E)

(cid:39)−→ X ⊂ Pr = P(V ), as illustrated by the diagram

The variety X ⊂ Pr is called a scroll over C. Note that X ⊂ Pr is a non-degenerate smooth projective
variety of dimension n and degree d. The main result of this paper is to establish the following regularity
bound.
Theorem 1.2. Let X ⊂ Pr be a scroll of codimension e and degree d over a smooth projective curve C
of genus g ≥ 0. Then one has

reg(X) ≤ d − e + 1 + g(e − 1).

When g = 0, Theorem 1.2 gives a sharp bound, which was also shown in [KEP, Theorem 5.2]) by
a diﬀerent method in characteristic zero. If g = 1, we get reg(X) ≤ d, which is already an interesting
bound. Although we are unable to establish the conjectured bound in general, our result gives a bound
for arbitrary dimension scrolls deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of any characteristic. If we further
impose extra conditions, the above bound can be established for certain singular scrolls (see Remark 3.4
for details).

The essential point in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is to pick a particular line bundle on the curve with
certain cohomological properties and then resolve its pullback on the scroll as OPr -module, as did in
[GLP] and [B]. Of course, the choice of such line bundle is not unique. For instance, in [GLP] and [N],
a diﬀerent line bundle with stronger properties has been considered to deduce a better regularity bound
for curves. However, for the higher dimensional scroll cases, it seems that this choice of line bundle does
not directly give a better regularity bound (see Remark 3.5 for details).

It is interesting to point out that a sharp regularity bound for the structure sheaf of a smooth projective
variety in characteristic zero has been established in [KJP, Theorem A], where the characteristic zero
and the smoothness assumptions are crucial. Ideally, the bound in Conjecture 1.1 would be relatively
easy to establish for structure sheaves. We mention some evidence in this direction in Corollary 2.3.

The paper is organized as follows:

hospitality, where this work was started.

In this section, we collect relevant basic facts. By a variety, we mean a separated reduced and irreducible
scheme of ﬁnite type over the ﬁeld k.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity. A coherent sheaf F on a projective variety X with a very
ample line bundle OX (1) is said to be m-regular with respect to OX (1) if

H i(X, F (m − i)) = 0

for all i > 0.

When the line bundle OX (1) is clearly from the context, we simply say F is m-regular. The least such
number, if exits, is denoted by reg(F ). When we work on a projective space X = Pr, the line bundle L is
always assumed to be OPr (1). By Mumford’s regularity theorem ([L2, Theorem 1.8.5]), if F is m-regular,
then F is (m + 1)-regular. For more details, see [L2, Section 1.8].
Lemma 2.1 ([L1, Lemmas 2.5]). Consider an exact sequence of coherent sheaves on Pr

If Fi is (p + i)-regular for some integer p and for each i ≥ 0, then F is p-regular.

··· −→ Fi −→ ··· −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ F −→ 0.

An embedded projective variety X ⊂ Pr is said to be m-regular if so is the ideal sheaf IX on Pr. It
(1) X ⊂ Pr is (m − 1)-normal, i.e., the natural restriction map

is equivalent to that

H 0(Pr, OPr (m − 1)) −→ H 0(X, OX (m − 1))

is surjective;

(2) OX is (m − 1)-regular.

The number reg(IX ) is called the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of X and is also denoted by reg(X).
Lemma 2.2. Let X ⊂ Pr be a non-degenerate projective variety of dimension n ≥ 2. Suppose that a
general hyperplane section Y = X∩Pr−1 is m-regular for some integer m > 0. Then OX is (m−1)-regular.
If moreover X ⊂ Pr is (m − 1)-normal, then it is m-regular.

Proof. Consider the short exact sequence

0 −→ OX (−1) −→ OX −→ OY −→ 0.

Since Y ⊂ Pr−1 is k-normal for all k ≥ m − 1, we obtain the surjective map

H 0(X, OX (k))−(cid:16) H 0(Y, OY (k)).

Furthermore, since OY is k-regular for all k ≥ m − 1, we have

H i−1(Y, OY (k − i + 1)) = H i(Y, OY (k − i + 1)) = 0

for all i ≥ 2.

It now follows that

H i(X, OX (k − i)) = H i(X, OX (k − i + 1))

for all i ≥ 1.

Note that H i(X, OX (l)) = 0 for i > 0 and a suﬃciently large integer l > 0. Thus OX is (m − 1)-regular.
If further assume that X is (m − 1)-normal, then it is clear that X is m-regular.
(cid:3)
Corollary 2.3. Let X ⊂ Pr be a non-degenerate projective variety of codimension e and degree d over
an algebraically closed ﬁeld k. Assume one the following conditions holds:

(i) dim X = 2;
(ii) dim X = 3, X has isolated singularities and char k = 0.

Then reg(OX ) ≤ d − e.
Proof. Take a general hyperplane section Y = X ∩ Pr−1. Since we are working over an inﬁnite ﬁeld, we
can apply Bertini’s theorem to Y . Thus Y is an integral curve under the condition (i) and a nonsingular
surface under the condition (ii). The embedding Y ⊂ Pr−1 is non-degenerate. By [GLP] and [L1], we
know that reg(Y ) ≤ d − e + 1. Now by the lemma above, OX is (d − e)-regular.
(cid:3)
2.2. Koszul cohomology. Let L be a very ample line bundle on a projective variety X, and V ⊂
H 0(X, L) be a base-point-free subspace that deﬁnes an embedding X ⊂ P(V ). Then there is a canonical
surjective evaluation homomorphism eV : V ⊗ OX → L. Deﬁne MV := ker(eV ). Then we have the short
exact sequence

0 −→ MV −→ V ⊗ OX −→ L −→ 0.

Now let B be a divisor on X, and write

R(X, B, L) :=

H 0(X, mL + B).

(cid:77)

m≥0

Then R = R(X, B, L) is a graded S := Sym(V )-module so that we get a minimal free resolution

··· −→(cid:77)

Kp,q(X, B, V ) ⊗k S(−p − q) −→ ··· −→(cid:77)

K0,q(X, B, V ) ⊗k S(−q) −→ R −→ 0.

q

Proposition 2.4 ([EL, Proposition 3.2]). Assume that H i(X, B + mL) = 0 for i > 0 and m > 0. Then
for q ≥ 2, we have

Kp,q(X, B, V ) = H 1(X,∧p+1MV ⊗ (B + (q − 1)L)).

If moreover H 1(X, B) = 0, then the same statement holds also when q = 1.

2.3. Existence of certain line bundles on a curve. The following will play an important role.
Lemma 2.5 ([GLP, Lemma 1.7]). Let C be a smooth irreducible projective curve of genus g, and p : C →
Pe+1 be a ﬁnite morphism of degree d = deg p∗OPe+1(1). Assume that p(C) is non-degenerate, and set
M = p∗Ω1Pe+1(1). Then for a general line bundle A of degree d− e + g on C, one has h0(C, A) = d− e + 1
and h1(C, A) = h1(C, M ⊗ A) = h1(C,∧2M ⊗ A) = 0.
2.4. Eagon-Northcott complex. Consider a generically surjective homomorphism u : E → F of vector
bundles of ranks e and f on a smooth variety. Then we can associate the Eagon-Northcott complex ENu
to u as follows:
0 → ∧eE ⊗ Syme−f−1(F ∗) ⊗ det F ∗ → ··· → ∧f +2E ⊗ F ∗ ⊗ det F ∗ → ∧f +1E ⊗ det F ∗ → E u−→ F → 0.

Lemma 2.6 ([L2, Theorem B.2.2]). The Eagon-Northcott complex ENu is exact away from the support
of coker(u).

The following diagram chasing lemma will be useful.

WENBO NIU AND JINHYUNG PARK

Lemma 2.7 ([L2, Proposition B.1.2]). Consider a complex
Fn−1 → ··· → F1 → F0

f−→ G → 0

of coherent sheaves on a projective variety X of dimension n with f surjective. Assume that
(1) the complex is exact away from a set of dimension ≤ 1;
(2) for a given integer 1 ≤ m ≤ n, we have hi(X, F0) = ··· = hi(X, Fn−m) = 0 for i > 0.

Then hi(X, G ) = 0 for i ≥ m.

3. Proof of the main result

In this section, we shall prove Theorems 1.2. We begin with recalling the notations. Let C be a smooth
irreducible projective curve of genus g ≥ 0, and E be a very ample vector bundle on C of rank n and
degree d. Assume that the embedding p : P(E) −→ Pr = P(V ) is determined by a base-point-free subspace
V ⊆ H 0(P(E), OP(E)(1)) of dimension r + 1. The scroll X is the image of p, equipped with a canonical
projection morphism t to the curve C. We denote by e = codim X and set S = Sym•(V ) to be the
symmetric algebra of V . Our setting can be summarized in the diagram

P(E)

/ X ⊂ Pr = P(V )

p

(cid:39) /

t

C

.

Just for the convenience, we use notation X to view the scroll as a porjecive subvariety in the projective
space and P(E) to emphasize it is a projective bundle over the curve. More often, we ignore the
embedding p if no confusion arises.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. The proof is splitted in several steps:
STEP 1. In this step, we shall take a general line bundle A of degree d − r + n + g on C with certain
cohomological vanishing properties.

Consider the following short exact sequence

0 −→ M(cid:48) −→ V ⊗ OP(E)

eV−→ OP(E)(1) −→ 0,

where M(cid:48) is the kernel bundle of the evaluation morphism eV . Pushing down this sequence to C by the
morphism t and noticing that R1t∗M(cid:48) = 0, we get a short exact sequence

0 −→ M −→ V ⊗ OC −→ E −→ 0,

where M = t∗M(cid:48). Note that V is naturally a subspace of H 0(C, E). Take a general subspace W ⊆ V of
dimension n− 1 and write V (cid:48) = V /W as the quotient space of dimension r − n + 2. By Snake lemma, we
obtain the following diagram

Clearly, det E is a degree d very ample line bundle and C0 = P(det E) ⊂ P(E) is a curve section of P(E)

cut out by the linear space P(V (cid:48)) = Pr−n+1. Note that OP(E)(1)|C0 = det E, C0 (cid:39) C and the embedding
C0 ⊂ P(V (cid:48)) is given by the subspace V (cid:48) ⊆ H 0(det E). Hence M can be realized as M = Ω1P(V (cid:48))|C0.
We apply Lemma 2.5 to the curve C thought of as the curve section C0 embedded in P(V (cid:48)) as above.
So we can choose a general line bundle A of degree d − r + n + g on C such that

(3.1)

h1(C, A) = h1(C, M ⊗ A) = h1(C,∧2M ⊗ A) = 0,
h0(C, A) = d − r + n + 1,

and h0(C, M ⊗ A) = (r − n)(d − r + n) + 1.

In addition, since d − r + n + g ≥ g, we can further choose A eﬀective, i.e.,

(3.2)

A = OC(D)

for D =

pi

with distinct general points pi’s on C.

i=1

d−r+n+g(cid:88)

STEP 2. Having chosen the line bundle A in Step 1, we pull it back to P(E) by the morphism t. Notice
that we have the following cohomology vanishings:

(1) H i(P(E), t∗A ⊗ OP(E)(m)) = 0, for 0 < i < n and m ∈ Z;
(2) H n(P(E), t∗A ⊗ OP(E)(m)) = 0, for m > 0;
(3) H 0(P(E), t∗A ⊗ OP(E)(−j)) = 0, for j > 0.

In this step, we shall construct a free resolution of the sheaf t∗A as OPr -module.

Consider the graded S-module

R := R(P(E), t∗A, OP(E)(1)) =

H 0(X, p∗t∗A ⊗ OX (m))

(cid:77)

m≥0

The cohomology vanishing (1) implies that R is a Cohen-Macaulay S-module of dimension n + 1. Recall
that W ⊆ V is a general subspace of dimension n − 1 and V (cid:48) = V /W . Assume that W = (cid:104)l1,··· , ln−1(cid:105)
spanned by the general linear forms li’s and write

S(cid:48) = Sym•(V (cid:48)) = S/(l1,··· , ln−1).

Thus by iteratively using Lemma 3.1, we see that a minimal free resolution of R over the ring S can be
computed from that of R ⊗ S(cid:48) over the ring S(cid:48). But geometrically, the forms l1,··· , ln−1 cut out the
curve section C0 such that t∗A|C0 = A and OPr (1)|C0 = det E. In addition, the cohomology vanishing
(1) guarantees that

R ⊗ S(cid:48) = R(C0, A, det E).

Furthermore, A is 1-regular since A is nonspecial. So R ⊗ S(cid:48) is 1-regular. Notice also the vanishing of
H 0(C0, A(−m)) = 0 for m > 0. Thus, a minimal free resolution of R⊗ S(cid:48) over S(cid:48) has the following shape

(3.3)

0 −→ S(cid:48)αr−n(−r + n) ⊕ S(cid:48)βr−n (−r + n − 1) −→ ··· −→ S(cid:48)α2 (−2) ⊕ S(cid:48)β2(−3) −→

−→ S(cid:48)α1 (−1) ⊕ S(cid:48)β1(−2) −→ S(cid:48)α0 ⊕ S(cid:48)β0(−1) −→ R ⊗ S(cid:48) −→ 0.

Using Proposition 2.4 and the vanishing (3.1), we can further compute that

α0 = h0(C, A) = d − r + n + 1, β0 = 0,

α1 = h0(C, M ⊗ A) = (r − n)(d − r + n) + 1, β1 = 0.

As we have explained, a minimal free resolution of R over S has the exactly same shape as in (3.3). So
taking sheaﬁﬁcation, we then obtain a free resolution of t∗A
··· −→ O α2Pr (−2) ⊕ O β2Pr (−3) −→ O (r−n)(d−r+n)+1

(−1) −→ O d−r+n+1

−→ t∗A −→ 0.

STEP 3. Recall that A = OC(D) for an eﬀective divisor D. It corresponds to a section sD in H 0(C, A),

This suggests that H 1(Pr, K(m)) = H 2(Pr, K(m)) = 0 for all m ∈ Z. Therefore chasing from the left
vertical sequence in the diagram (3.5), we get

(3.6)

H 1(Pr, N (m)) = H 1(Pr, IX (m))

for all m ∈ Z.

STEP 4. In this step, we obtain a locally free resolution for the cokernal sheaf F in the diagram (3.5).
Recall the choice of the eﬀective divisor D in (3.2), which corresponds to a section sD of H 0(A). Then
we have the short exact sequence

Let Xi := t−1(pi) (cid:39) Pn−1 and pull-back the above sequence to P(E). We obtain the short exact sequence

where P = ker(w(cid:48)) and φ2 = φ1|N .
To see this, we ﬁrst construct φ0. Set V = ker v and W = ker w. It is easy to check that H 0(Pr, V ) =
H 0(Pr, W ) = H 1(Pr, W ) = 0. So we can apply Lemma 3.2 to the morphisms v, w and idF to get
the desired morphism φ0. Next, we construct φ1. For this, we can check that H 0(Pr, N (1)) = 0 and
H 0(Pr, P (1)) = 0. In addition, we have the restricted morphism φ0|V : V −→ W . Hence, if we twisting
OPr (1) to the morphism φ0|V , then we can apply Lemma 3.2 to lift it, which will give us the desired φ1
by twisting back by OPr (−1). Therefore, we get the commutative diagram (3.8) as claimed.

Note that from the construction above, we have

Coker φ0 = O gPr

Therefore, a standard diagram chasing for (3.8) by Snake lemma gives us a short exact sequence

(−1) −→ O gPr −→ 0,

(3.9)
where we set f = d − r + n − 1 + ge and F = Coker φ2, which is a vector bundle of rank f on Pr. Taking
the dual of (3.9), we obtain the short exact sequence
0 −→ O gPr −→ O f +gPr

(3.10)
By Lemma 2.1, we see that F ∗ is (−1)-regular. In addition, for each i > 0, the short exact sequences
induces an exact complex

that H 2(Pr, ker(w(cid:48)(cid:48))(m)) = 0 for m ∈ Z. We apply the Eagon-Northcott complex to the morphism q to
obtain a free resolution of ker(q)

··· −→ ∧f +2(O n2Pr (−2)) ⊗ Sym1(F ∗) ⊗ det F ∗ −→ ∧f +1(O n2Pr (−2)) ⊗ det F ∗ −→ ker(q) −→ 0.

(3.12)
Note that det F ∗ = OPr (f + g) which is −(f + g)-regular. In addition, for i = 0, 1, ··· , the i-th term in
the resolution (3.12) is

∧f +i+1(O n2Pr (−2)) ⊗ Symi(F ∗) ⊗ det F ∗

which is a direct sum of copies of Symi(F ∗)(−f − 2 + g − 2i). Since we have seen that Symi(F ∗) is
(−i)-regular, we obtain that ∧f +i+1(O n2Pr (−2))⊗ Symi(F ∗)⊗ det F ∗ is (f + 2− g + i)-regular. By Lemma
2.1, we see that ker(q) is (f + 2 − g)-regular. In particular, this implies that H 1(Pr, ker(q)(m)) = 0 for
all m ≥ f + 1 − g. Thus H 1(Pr, N (m)) = 0 for all m ≥ f + 1 − g. Hence by (3.6), we deduce that

X ⊂ Pr is m-normal for m ≥ f + 1 − g.

Note that a general hyperplane section of a scroll is again a scroll. Furthermore, we know the regularity
conjecture holds for the curve case by [GLP]. Hence inductively by Lemma 2.2, we obtain

reg(X) ≤ f + 2 − g = d − e + 1 + g(e − 1),

which ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem.

(cid:3)

To complete the proof of Theorem 1.2, it only remains to show the following easy lemmas.

Lemma 3.1. Let F be a coherent sheaf on Pr and write S = Sym•(H 0(Pr, OPr (1))). Assume that

(1) R = ⊕m∈ZH 0(Pr, F (m)) is a ﬁnitely generated graded S-module;
(2) H 1(Pr, F (m)) = 0 for all m ∈ Z.

Consider a minimal free resolutions of R as an S-module as follows:

Then we can take a general linear form l ∈ H 0(Pr, OPr (1)) such that

··· −→ F2 −→ F1 −→ F0 −→ R −→ 0.

(i) the complex

··· −→ F2 ⊗ S(cid:48) −→ F1 ⊗ S(cid:48) −→ F0 ⊗ S(cid:48) −→ R ⊗ S(cid:48) −→ 0

is a minimal free resolution of R ⊗ S(cid:48) as S(cid:48)-module, where S(cid:48) = S/(l);
(ii) R ⊗ S(cid:48) = ⊕m∈ZH 0(H, FH (m)), where H is the hyperplane deﬁned by l.

Proof. Since the maximal homogeneous ideal S+ is not an associative prime of M , a general linear form
l is a nonzero divisor of M and TorS

1 (M, S(cid:48)) = 0. Hence (i) is clear.

For (ii), since l is general, we have a short exact sequence

0 −→ F (−1)

·l−→ F −→ FH −→ 0.

Hence it is enough to show the restriction morphisms

H 0(Pr, F (m)) −→ H 0(Pr, FH (m))
are surjective, for all m ∈ Z. But this follows from the assumption (2).
Lemma 3.2. Let F and G be coherent sheaves on Pr. Consider the following diagram

(cid:3)

(3.13)

O aPr

∃ φ(cid:48)

O bPr

u

v

F

φ

/ G

/ 0

where u and v are surjective morphisms, φ is a morphism, and a ≤ b. Assume that the morphisms on
global sections induced by u, v and φ are all injective and satisfy the condition that

(φ ◦ u)(H 0(Pr, O aPr )) ⊆ v(H 0(Pr, O bPr )).

Then there exists an injective morphism φ(cid:48) : O aPr −→ O bPr with Coker φ(cid:48) (cid:39) O b−aPr
φ, i.e, the diagram (3.13) is commutative.

and it lifts the morphism

Proof. By assumption, we may assume that O aPr (cid:39) V ⊗ OPr and O bPr (cid:39) W ⊗ OPr for vectors subspaces V
and W of H 0(Pr, G ) such that V ⊆ W . Hence φ(cid:48) is induced by the inclusion V ⊆ W . The commutativity
of the diagram (3.13) is checked locally by using the fact that at a closed point x, the elements of V and
(cid:3)
W induce sets of generators for Fx and Gx, respectively.

Remark 3.3. The idea in the proof of Theorem 1.2 follows the one in Bertin’s work [B], which goes back
to the work of [GLP]. We choose the same line bundle A as in [B] to deduce a locally free resolution
of t∗A. However, in [B, p.180], Bertin claims that the sheaﬁﬁcation of a minimal free resolution of the
cokernel sheaf F is of the form

(3.14)

··· −→ O (r−n+1)(d+n−r)

Pr

(−1) −→ O d−r+n

Pr

−→ F −→ 0,

from which she deduced the conjectured regularity bound for scrolls. Unfortunately, the resolution (3.14)
only works when genus g = 0. For arbitrary genus g, since h0(Pr, F ) = d− r + n + g, the sequence (3.14)
cannot be deduced from a minimal free resolution. The correct free resolution is (3.7) but the diﬀerence
between d − r + n and d − r + n + g makes the proof be slightly complicated. Our main contribution to
the proof of Theorem 1.2 is Steps 5 and 6 which contains new ideas.

Remark 3.4. We can use the exact same argument to generalize Theorem 1.2 to singular case under
certain conditions. For the convenience of the reader, we formulate this direction here and leave the
details. For this purpose, assume that C is a smooth projective curve of genus g ≥ 0, and let E be a
vector bundle on C of rank n and degree d. Assume that V ⊆ H 0(P(E), OP(E)(1)) is a base-point-free
subspace of dimension r + 1. It induces a birational morphism p : P(E) −→ Pr = P(V ) to the image X.
So we have the diagram as follows:

P(E)

p

/ X ⊂ Pr = P(V )

t

.

We can regard X as a generalized scroll. As we did before, in order to get a regularity bound for X, we
take a general line bundle A = OC(D) for D = p1 + p2 +··· + pd−r+n+g consisting of general d− r + n + g
points. The eﬀective divisor D gives a section sD ∈ H 0(C, A) which induces a short exact sequence

0 −→ OC

·sD−→ A −→ AD −→ 0.

Assume the following two conditions:

(1) p∗OP(E) = OX ;
(2) the induced morphism R1p∗(t∗OC) −→ R1p∗(t∗A) is injective.

Then the proof of Theorem 1.2 works without much change and we can obtain the same regularity bound.
Note that the condition (2) is equivalent to

H 1(P(E), OP(E)(m)) = H 1(C, Symm(E)) = 0 for m (cid:29) 0,

which may not be satisﬁed in general when E is not ample and g > 0.

Remark 3.5. [GLP] and [N] show a diﬀerent choice of the line bundle A which gives a better regularity
bound for curves. It is achieved by the key observation that a minimal free resolution of such special
line bundle A has a good shape (see [GLP, Lemma 2.3] and [N, Lemma 4]). However, for the higher
dimensional scroll cases, it seems that a minimal free resolution induced by this special line bundle has no
longer a good shape in general. For instance, consider an elliptic surface scroll S ⊂ P4 of degree 5. Then
the special line bundle is nothing but the structure sheaf A = OS. It is expected that the sheaﬁﬁcation
of a minimal free resolution of OS is of the form

··· −→ O n1P4 (−1) −→ OP4 −→ OS −→ 0.
However, the actual sheaﬁﬁcation of a minimal free resolution of OS is
··· −→ O 5P4(−2) −→ OP4 −→ OS −→ 0.

on the scroll is not Cohen-Macaulay (cf. the section module R =(cid:76)

The main reason for this phenomenon is that the section module of the pullback of this special line bundle
m≥0 H 0(X, p∗t∗A ⊗ OX (m)) in Step

2 of Proof of Theorem 1.2 is Cohen-Macaulay).
