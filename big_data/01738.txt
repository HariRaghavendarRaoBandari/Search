S-matrix amplitudes for the electron-electron scattering are calculated in order to verify the quan-
tum equivalence of dual models. We used an extended Quantum Electrodynamics with CPT-even
Lorentz-violating kinetic and mass terms, which was used in a process of gauge embedding, known
as Noether dualizationn method (NDM), in order to generate its gauge-invariant dual model. The
physical equivalence was established at tree-level and the cross section was calculated to second
order in the Lorentz-violating parameter.

INTRODUCTION

In some situations it is possible to establish relations between a class of models which are essentially
diﬀerent but that are equivalent in describing the physical behavior of a system. These are called dual
models. This concept of duality is very useful, because there are some physical properties which are hidden
in one model but are explicit in its dual theory. For example, the relation between electric and magnetic
couplings are implemented by the dual mapping of a weakly-coupled theory in a strongly-coupled one.

Historically, the ﬁrst well established dual correspondence has been formulated by Deser and Jackiw,
between the three-dimensional spacetime self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models [1]. Besides, this
duality was discussed as a part of a wide class of models in [2]. The subject was developed since then with
the elaboration of diﬀerent techniques to attain the duality between models [3]. Among the approaches to
obtain physically equivalent models, we can cite the master action method [4] and the gauge embedding
technique [5]. In the ﬁrst approach, the so-called master action involves two vector ﬁelds and the dual
models are obtained with the use of the equations of motion for each one of the ﬁelds. In the gauge
embedding procedure (also called Noether dualization method), on the other hand, a gauge theory is
obtained from a self-dual model by the use of iterative embedding Noether counterterms, which are on
mass shell vanishing terms. The Noether dualization method (NDM) is based on the idea of a local lifting
of a global symmetry, which was important for the construction of component-ﬁeld supergravity actions
[6–8].

The gauging iterative Noether Dualization Method has been shown to be eﬀective in establishing
dualities between some models [9]. This method provides a strong suggestion of duality, since it furnishes
the expected result in the paradigmatic duality between the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models
in three dimensions. Furthermore, the procedure has been applied in the context of Lorentz-violating
models with interesting results [10], [11], [12], [13].

However, an intriguing result has been shown to be general when NDM is applied to Procca-like models
[14]. The gauge model obtained from the dualization algorithm, although sharing with the original theory
the physical spectrum, acquires ghost modes. More precisely, the gauge model obtained by means of NDM

encompasses the physical spectrum of the original Procca-like theory and, in addition, it possesses, with
the wrong sign, the spectrum of the corresponding massless model. This was shown to be true even for
Lorentz-breaking theories. In [14], it was obtained a relation between the propagators of dual models
which shed some light on this fact.

Alternatives to avoid the emergency of ghosts in the process of dualization were studied [15], [16], [17],
[18]. In some cases, the price to be paid is the lost of locality [15]. For a model with a spin-2 self-dual
ﬁeld in three spacetime dimensions, it was shown that the dual theory achieved by NDM does not suﬀer
with the presence of ghosts [18].

In [12], it was considered the dualization of a CPT-even model which includes Lorentz-breaking kinetic
and mass terms. It was found a generalization of the relation of [14], with new terms. The existence
of ghost modes in the dualized model is kind of uncomfortable if one cannot show that the nonphysical
modes decouple and have no dynamics. A possible analysis is the study of the saturated propagator
which makes use of the current conservation to discard the nondynamical poles. However, it is desirable
to see how it works in a practical calculation, like in a quantum process.

In this paper, we reassess the model of [12], with the inclusion of the fermionic and the interaction
sectors. The dualization by gauge embedding is carried out and the dual gauge invariant theory is
obtained. In addition to the action achieved in the previous work, new interaction terms are generated,
which are nonminimal. In order to check the decoupling of the nonphysical modes, S-matrix amplitudes
for the electron-electron scattering are calculated. We show that nontrivial cancelations occur in the
calculation with the dualized action, such that the perturbative equivalence is established at tree-level.
The paper is organized as follows. In section II, we describe and justify the model under analysis and,
further, obtain by the Noether dualization technique its gauge invariant dual theory. In section III, the
tree level calculation of the electron-electron scattering is performed and the perturbative equivalence of
the models is veriﬁed. The concluding comments are enclosed in section IV.

II. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL AND DUALIZATION

In the present work, we consider the CPT-even Lorentz-breaking model of [12], but now with the vector
ﬁeld Aµ minimally coupled to a Dirac fermion. Thus, we have an extended QED model deﬁned by the
Lagrangian density

where hµν = gµν − βbµbν and bµ is a constant background four-vector. Here, m and M are the masses
of the gauge ﬁeld Aµ and the electron, respectively, whereas ρ and β are dimensionless parameters
introduced just to make explicit the contributions from distinct Lorentz-violating terms which appear
in (1). The kinetic Lorentz-violating term, which we call aether term [19], is a particular version of the
more general CPT-even part of the gauge sector of the Standard Model Extension [20, 21], and can be
radiatively induced [22] when nonminimal couplings to fermions [23] are considered. On the other hand,
the Lorentz-breaking mass term in the gauge sector can, for example, be generated by spontaneous gauge
symmetry breaking in a Lorentz-violating gauge-Higgs model [24], emerging from the symmetric part of
the second-rank background tensor which couples to the kinetic part of the Higgs ﬁeld.

The gauge sector of this model was investigated in detail in [12] and it was shown that it incorporates
very interesting features. For example, it presents physical massive poles which, depending on the choice
of the coeﬃcients ρ and β, have its degrees of freedom changed. For this class of models, uncommon
physical aspects can be accommodated for particular values of ρ and β, like, for example, the presence
of propagating superluminal modes.

We now proceed to the dualization using the Noether dualization method. First, we carry out the

variation of (1) related to an inﬁnitesimal change δAµ in the gauge ﬁeld:

δL(0) = (cid:8)∂βF βµ + ρbβbα∂βF αµ − ρbµbα∂βF αβ + m2hµαAα + e ¯ψγµψ(cid:9) δAµ

≡ J µδAµ.

(2)

3

Of course, it is an oﬀ-shell method, since in the space of solutions we will have J µ = 0. So the current
J µ in (2) can be used to construct a second Lagrangian density,

L(1) = L(0) − BµJ µ,

(3)

where Bµ is an auxiliary vector ﬁeld. If the auxiliary ﬁeld is chosen such that δBµ = δAµ, the variation
of (3) will be given by

in which δJµ = m2hµνδAν . With the variation (4), we can use the auxiliary ﬁeld Bµ to construct a gauge
invariant Lagrangian density. Actually, using a compensatory quadratic term in Bµ as

δL(1) = −BµδJ µ,

(4)

we have δL(2) = 0. Finally, it is used the equation of motion for the ﬁeld Bµ to obtain

L(2) = L(1) +

which should be used to write L(2) in terms of the ﬁeld Aµ. So the resulting dual gauge invariant

By construction, the NDM method gives rise to a gauge invariant Lagrangian, whereas the original
model (1) does not have this symmetry. It is believed that the non-invariant model can be considered as
the gauge ﬁxed version of a gauge theory. Note that now the Dirac fermions are nonminimally coupled to
the gauge ﬁeld Aµ. Besides, the dual Lagrangian has a contribution of a four-fermion nonrenormalizable
vertex, which is similar to the result obtained in the duality between the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-
Simons models coupled to fermions [28].

III. ELECTRON-ELECTRON SCATTERING

We now proceed to quantum perturbative calculations in order to check, at tree level, the physical
equivalence of the models. We ﬁrst observe the two photon propagators. From the quadratic terms in

Aµ, the propagators for the gauge ﬁeld in momentum-space for the original (1) and the dual (8) models
are given, respectively, by

Returning to the Feynman rules, in both cases the propagator of the matter ﬁeld is the usual Dirac

Now we start to investigate the physical equivalence between the models, which is the main purpose
of this letter. We are going to calculate the S-matrix contribution at order e2 in the electron-electron
scattering.

A. Calculation with the original model

First, we consider the original model (1). Since the model has only the usual Dirac fermion minimally
coupled to the gauge ﬁeld Aµ, the two diagrams in ﬁgure 1 contribute at tree-level with the same vertex as
ordinary QED. However, in this case, with the Aµ propagator given by expression (9). The contribution
to the S-matrix amplitude is given by −(2π)4δ(p′

We have used p1 and p2 for external momentum of the free electrons in the initial states described by
the spinors u(p1) and u(p2), and p′

expression (14) can be obtained from the direct application of the LSZ reduction formula.

Since the fermions are on-shell, all terms from Dµν

can be neglected in the calculation of the amplitude. Thus, we stay with

B. Calculation with the dual model

Interestingly, we can establish the perturbative equivalence between the original and the dual models
at tree-level by comparing the expression (15) with the similar expression obtained by using the Feynman
rules from the Lagrangian (8). Besides the two diagrams in ﬁgure 1, in the dual model we must take into
account the diagrams of ﬁgure 2. For the calculation of the diagrams of ﬁgure 1, in this case, the Dirac

In fact, using expressions (7) and (18) for Lµν and Qµν , respectively, and after a very lengthy algebra on
the left-hand side of (23), the above relation is checked. So, τO = τD and the equivalence at this order is
proved.

C. The cross section

To ﬁnish, we present the tree-level cross section for the electron-electron scattering at second order in the
Lorentz-violating parameter bµ. To carry out this calculation, we have used the FeynCalc Mathematica
package. The cross section is given by

where τ = τO = τD and E is the energy in the center of mass. Using the approximations m/M << 1

to the Procca term, which reads

where θ is the scattering angle between the direction of the incident and the outgoing particles. The last
term of (25) is the correction introduced by the Lorentz violation. Just to illustrate, we explicitly show
the expressions for timelike and spacelike bµ. For bµ spacelike, we take bµ = (t, 0, 0, 0), such that the

For the spacelike case, we use bµ = (0, 0, 0, t) and the Lorentz-violating contribution reads

To carry out these calculations we have chosen the spatial part of bµ in the same direction of the

contributes to the cross section, since only the parameter ρ appears in (25). The Lorentz-violating mass
term in (1), which appears multiplied by the parameter β, will contribute only at higher orders.

IV. CONCLUSION

8

We investigated the quantum equivalence of two dual Lorentz-breaking models. The procedure of
dualization is known to produce knew nonphysical modes which, in some cases, may turn the model
meaningless. A way out is to show that the new sector decouples from the physical part, and does
not disturb the practical calculations. In some situations it is simple to prove that these modes have
no dynamics by saturating the propagators with conserved currents. Here we opted to show how this
mechanism works in a practical calculation of a physical process, more precisely the cross section of the
electron-electron scattering.

We used the dual models studied in detail in [12], in which a complicated structure of poles emerged
for the dual gauge-invariant model. The equivalence of the models in this calculation was shown at
tree-level through nontrivial cancelations. For this, an essential role was played by the new fermionic
couplings which emerged in the dualization process. We expect that this equivalence is still valid in the
nonperturbative approach, which is left for a future investigation.
