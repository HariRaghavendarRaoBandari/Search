We compute the S-factor of the proton-proton (pp) fusion reaction using chiral eﬀective ﬁeld
theory (χEFT) up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and perform a rigorous uncertainty
analysis of the results. We quantify the uncertainties due to (i) the computational method used
to compute the pp cross section in momentum space, (ii) the statistical uncertainties in the low-
energy coupling constants of χEFT, (iii) the systematic uncertainty due to the χEFT cutoﬀ, and
(iv) systematic variations in the database used to calibrate the nucleon-nucleon interaction. We
also examine the robustness of the polynomial extrapolation procedure, which is commonly used to
extract the threshold S-factor and its energy-derivatives. By performing a statistical analysis of the
polynomial ﬁt of the energy-dependent S-factor at several diﬀerent energy intervals, we eliminate
a systematic uncertainty that can arise from the choice of the ﬁt interval in our calculations. In
addition, we explore the statistical correlations between the S-factor and few-nucleon observables
such as the binding energies and point-proton radii of 2,3H and 3,4He as well as the D-state proba-
bility and quadrupole moment of 2H, and the β-decay of 3H. We ﬁnd that, with the state-of-the-art
optimization of the nuclear Hamiltonian, the statistical uncertainty in the threshold S-factor cannot
be reduced beyond 0.7%.

INTRODUCTION

In main sequence stars such as the Sun, the conversion
of hydrogen to helium proceeds predominantly through
the pp chain, which is primarily triggered by the weak
pp-fusion process [1, 2],

p + p → d + e+ + νe.

(1)

The accurate determination of the rate of this reaction
is a critical ingredient for our understanding of many
stellar processes. The reaction rate is conventionally
parametrized in terms of the S-factor, which is related
to the cross section by

S(E) = σ(E)Ee2πη,

(cid:112)mp/E α/2 is the Sommerfeld parameter. This cross

where E is the center of mass energy and η =

(2)

section can only be measured in experiments performed
at rather high energies in order to overcome the Coulomb
barrier between the protons. Extrapolations of S(E) to
relevant energy domains, E < 10 keV, which is where the
Gamow peak of the Sun lies, yield extremely large uncer-
tainties. Therefore, we are forced to rely on theoretical
calculations to provide a precise prediction. This situa-
tion turns the accompanying uncertainty analysis into an
absolute necessity. However, the quantiﬁcation of theo-
retical uncertainties, which can have many diﬀerent ori-
gins, is a very diﬃcult task and a rigorous uncertainty
analysis is still lacking. It is the purpose of this Letter
to signiﬁcantly advance the state-of-the-art of theoretical
uncertainty quantiﬁcation for the pp-fusion process.

Although calculations of S(E) can be performed at
ﬁrst order in the weak coupling constant, they still re-
quire a detailed knowledge of the nuclear interaction,

which has to be treated nonperturbatively. Potential
models therefore provided the ﬁrst insights into this
process [3–6]. Still, obtaining reliable uncertainty esti-
mates has always proven to be hard with such models for
the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Eﬀective ﬁeld theories
(EFTs) are systematic low-energy expansions in a small
parameter and are capable to provide an estimate of the
the inherent systematic error. An eﬀort to provide un-
certainty estimates was ﬁrst carried out in [7, 8] using
the so-called hybrid approach in which current opera-
tors were obtained from χEFT and wave functions from
phenomenological potentials. The ﬁrst complete χEFT
calculation of the S-factor was carried out by Marcucci
et al. [9], who obtained

S = (4.030 ± 0.006) × 10

−23 MeV fm2 ,

(3)

with an uncertainty (see below) seven times smaller than
that of the previously recommended value [2]
−23 MeV fm2 .

(4)

S = (4.01 ± 0.04) × 10

Pionless EFT calculations [10–13], which use only the
nucleons as explicit degrees of freedom, have obtained
consistent values, albeit with slightly larger theory errors.
Since uncertainty analysis was not the main objective
of Ref. [9], their error estimates were based on simple
assumptions. The current operators and the wavefunc-
tions were calculated to high precision — O(Q3) and
O(Q4), respectively — by employing χEFT interactions
widely used in the literature. The uncertainty was then
estimated from the range of S-factor values obtained by
using two diﬀerent short-distance regulators in the two-
body current and the potential. Thus, the error reported

in Ref. [9] only reﬂects the resulting spread in the S-factor
at a mixed order in the EFT expansion.

In this Letter we study the pp-fusion process in χEFT
at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). In particular,
we perform an accompanying uncertainty quantiﬁcation
that builds on recent progress in mathematical optimiza-
tion and statistical analysis of chiral nuclear forces and
ab initio nuclear theory [14–18]. We quantify both sta-
tistical uncertainties, associated with the determination
of the relevant low-energy constants (LECs), as well as
several systematic ones, related to the computational
method and to the chiral expansion. In this process we
aim for consistency, e.g. by regulating the weak-current
operator of the pp-fusion process in a manner that is con-
sistent with the β-decay used in the ﬁt of the nuclear
potential.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we dis-
cuss the weak current operator and the initial and ﬁnal
state wave functions. In Sec. III, we present an analysis of
the uncertainties in the S-factor calculation. In Sec. IV,
we present our ﬁnal results along with a discussion.

where pe,ν are the positron and neutrino momenta, Ee,ν
their energies, md is the deuteron mass, vrel is the pp
relative velocity, and q is the momentum of the recoiling
deuteron. The function F (Z, Ee) accounts for the distor-
tion of the positron wave function due to the Coulomb
ﬁeld of the deuteron. Its classical expression, which can
be found in Ref. [19], is increased by 1.62% due to radia-
tive corrections [20]. The summation runs over the spin
projections of all the initial and the ﬁnal state particles.
The initial state |i(cid:105) and the ﬁnal state |f(cid:105) are direct prod-
ucts of leptonic and nuclear states. At nuclear energies,
the weak interaction Hamiltonian can be written in terms
of the leptonic and the nuclear weak current operators as

with the summation running over the spin projections of
the leptons. Note that Eqs. (5) and (7) look diﬀerent
from the ones in Ref. [9, 21] because we include the 2Ee
and 2Eν denominators in Eq. (5) to make the phase space
volume element manifestly Lorentz invariant.

The nuclear wave functions are calculated up to NNLO
in χEFT. The nuclear weak current operators are con-
sistently derived from the same eﬀective Lagrangian up
to the same order in Q, i.e. O(Q3). In this approach,
the strong interaction dynamics between the nucleons in-
volved is based on the same theoretical grounds as their
coupling to the leptonic current.

A. Nuclear weak current operators

The current operators for charge-changing weak inter-

actions were derived in χEFT in Refs. [7, 8, 22, 23].

The one-body (1B) operators that give non-vanishing
matrix elements between an S-wave pp wave function
and the S- and D-wave conﬁgurations of the deuteron
include, up to O(Q3), the Gamow-Teller operator,

which is O(Q). Here the index l runs over both nucle-
ons, gA is the axial vector coupling constant, τ−
is the
isospin lowering operator (τ x

are additional operators [8, 24] that enter according to
the χEFT power counting scheme 1. The matrix elements
of those operators are, however, kinematically suppressed
for the extremely small proton energies being considered
here. The χEFT 1B currents operators used here have
the same structure as the ones obtained phenomenologi-
cally in earlier studies (see, e.g. Ref. [25]).

The pp wave function obtained is correct to NNLO
in χEFT and ﬁrst order in the electromagnetic coupling
constant, α. We do not include higher-order electromag-
netic contributions explicitly in this work. These elec-
tromagnetic interaction terms mainly lower the central
value of the pp-fusion cross section [6, 7, 9], as discussed
in Sec. IV, and leave the corresponding error due to un-
certainties in the description of the strong nuclear force
unchanged.

square of the overlap between the pp wave function at en-

where C 2
we calculate includes deuteron recoil eﬀects and meson-
exchange current contributions. The former modiﬁes not
only the phase space but also the matrix element in
Eq. (5). The meson-exchange current, which turns out to
be the dominant correction, is conventionally quantiﬁed
as δ2B, deﬁned as the ratio of the matrix element of J−
2B
to that of J−
GT [8]. While the dependence of Λ(E) on the
LECs of χEFT is solely through the N N interaction in
the initial and the ﬁnal state wave functions, δ2B depends
explicitly on many of the LECs through the current op-
erator, and therefore deserves a careful scrutiny in spite
of its relatively small contribution to the overall value of
the S-factor.

III. CALCULATIONS

In this section we compute the quantities that are rele-
vant for describing low-energy pp fusion. In addition, we
will explore several sources of statistical and systematic
uncertainties.

constants d1 and d2 that appear in the short-range 2B
current are constrained by the Pauli principle such that
only one linear combination, d1 + 2d2 = cD/(gAΛEFT)
enters. The constants c3 and c4, which accompany the
one-pion exchange current, also appear in the N N and
πN interactions, as well as along with cD in the N N N
interaction. For the current, it is customary to deﬁne the

to parametrize the strength of the meson-exchange cur-
rent.

B. Nuclear wave functions

The NNLO momentum-space potentials that we em-
ploy are non-local. We obtain the S-state (L = 0) and
D-state (L = 2) components of the deuteron wave func-
tion in coordinate space by diagonalizing in a harmonic-
oscillator basis. We ﬁnd that it is necessary to correctly
reproduce the deuteron wave function beyond 50 fm in
order to achieve infrared convergence of the radial inte-
grals.

This bound-state problem is easily solved equally well
in either momentum space or coordinate space. Unfor-
tunately, this dual approach is not as trivial for the rel-
ative pp-scattering wave function, ψ(r; E) as the pres-
ence of the long-ranged Coulomb potential implies that
the momentum space representation of the scattering po-
tential becomes singular for equal incoming and outgo-
ing relative momenta.
In order to facilitate a numer-
ical solution we follow the prescription of Vincent and
Phatak [26] and introduce a cutoﬀ radius Rc. For radii
r < Rc, the Coulomb potential is well-deﬁned in momen-
tum space. In this region we can therefore apply ordi-
nary methods to ﬁnd ψ(r < Rc; E). Furthermore, if we
choose Rc > 35 fm, such that the short-ranged nuclear
interaction becomes negligible, we can smoothly match
the solution at r = Rc to the asymptotic Coulomb wave
function,

r→∞ χ0(r; E) = cos δ0 F0(r(cid:112)mpE)
+ sin δ0 G0(r(cid:112)mpE),

lim

where δ0 is the S-wave phase shift with respect to the
nuclear and Coulomb potential, F0 and G0 are, respec-
tively, the regular and the irregular Coulomb wave func-
tions, and χ0(r; E) is the radial S-wave pp wave function,
which, upon ignoring higher partial wave contributions,
is related to ψ(r; E) by

A. Axial-vector coupling constant

The S-factor depends predominantly on gA explicitly,
2. The most recent world aver-
by the relation S ∝ gA
age value for gA, calculated by the Particle Data Group
(PDG), is 1.2701(25) [27]. The values obtained in some
of the recent experiments [28, 29] are higher than the
world average. For our uncertainty analysis, we use the
PDG recommended value which in turn is very close to
the 1.2695(29) value used by Marcucci et al. in Ref. [9].

B. Chiral interactions and currents

In this work we employ the family of 42 diﬀerent
NNLOsim interactions, see Ref. [18] for a complete de-
scription. These potentials are optimized to simultane-
ously reproduce N N -as well as πN -scattering data, the
binding energies and charge radii of 2,3H and 3,4He, the
quadrupole moment of 2H, as well as the the compara-
tive β-decay half-life of 3H. The covariance matrices of
the LECs are precisely known for each NNLOsim interac-
tion. This oﬀers a unique possibility to explore the sta-
tistical uncertainties and correlations related to the pp-
fusion process. Also, utilizing a large set of interactions
allows us to better explore the systematic uncertainties.
Each NNLOsim potential is associated with one of seven
diﬀerent cutoﬀs ΛEFT = 450, 475, . . . , 575, 600 MeV. In
addition, the database of experimental N N scattering
cross-sections used to constrain the respective interac-
tion was also varied.
It was truncated at six diﬀerent
maximum scattering energies in the laboratory system
T max
Lab = 125, . . . , 290 MeV. It should be pointed out that
for all NNLOsim interactions, an equally good description
of the ﬁt data is attained and all LECs are of natural or-
der.

Furthermore, and similar to the work in Ref. [8], we
regulate the ultraviolet behavior of the matrix elements
of all current operators using a Gaussian regulator on the
form exp[−k2/2Λ2
EFT], where k is deﬁned in Sec. II A.
The N N -sector of the NNLOsim potentials is regulated
in similar way; exp[−(p/ΛEFT)2n], where n = 3 and p is
the relative momentum of the two interacting nucleons.
We use the same value for the cutoﬀ ΛEFT in the currents
as we use in the interactions.

C. Central values

The family of 42 optimized χEFT interactions at
NNLO is employed to construct an averaged central value
for each one of the computed quantities using the arith-
metic mean of the separate calculations. The magni-
tudes of the statistical uncertainties in each calculation
are nearly identical. Thus it is not necessary to explore
weighted average schemes.

The energy dependence of the astrophysical S-factor,

is usually parametrized using a polynomial expansion

S(E) = S(0) + S(cid:48)

(0)E + S(cid:48)(cid:48)

(0)E2/2 + . . .

(15)

A second- or third-order polynomial is most common.
Higher-order polynomials turn out to be ill-conditioned
extrapolants attributed with large statistical uncertain-
ties. The normalized n-th order derivative Sn(0)/S(0)
often serve as input to e.g. neutrino ﬂux computations
using solar models. We ﬁt theoretical S(E)-values to a
third-order polynomial across an energy range E = 1−30
keV. From this we extract the S-factor at zero energy.
From the results obtained with the diﬀerent interac-
tions, we extract the following averaged central values:

S(0) = 4.081 × 10−23 MeV fm2, Λ2(0) = 7.087, δ2B =

0.43%, S(cid:48)(0)/S(0) = 10.84 MeV
317.8 MeV

−2.

D. Uncertainty analysis

We start by considering systematic uncertainties as-
sociated with the methods used to compute the cross
section and to extrapolate to zero energy.

The polynomial ﬁt of S(E) depends on the limits of the
ﬁt-interval IE = [Emin, Emax]. Also, the polynomial ﬁt is
uninformed by the underlying physics. As such, it is not
evident a priori what limits IE to use. The numerical
precision of our computational code allows us to safely
set Emin = 1 keV. To ﬁnd the optimal Emax, we deﬁne a
penalty function

(cid:88)

i∈IE

χ2 =

(1 − f ﬁt

i /f calc

i

)2 ,

(16)

i denotes the ﬁtted S(E) values, and f calc

where f ﬁt
corre-
sponds to the values evaluated at 1 keV intervals. Over-
all, we ﬁnd that the cubic polynomial ﬁts the calculated
S(E) values better than a quadratic polynomial.

i

For a qubic polynomial, and by varying Emax be-
tween 4-100 keV, we ﬁnd that Emax = 30 keV is op-
timal. For this choice, the statistical uncertainties of
S(0), S(cid:48)(0)/S(0), S(cid:48)(cid:48)(0)/S(0), due to the polynomial ﬁt,
attain a minimum. The extrapolated S(0)-values, as a
function of Emax are shown in Fig. 1. The central value
for S(0) decreases and the corresponding statistical un-
certainty of the polynomial ﬁt increases when Emax (cid:38) 30
keV. The same trend is observed for all 42 NNLO inter-
actions. The statistical error of the ﬁt is ten times larger
at Emax = 100 keV than it is at Emax = 30 keV. There-
fore, we choose to ﬁt all computed S(E)-values to a third

020406080100Emax(keV)4.0554.0604.0654.0704.0754.0804.085S(0)(10−23MeVfm2)order polynomial across the energy interval IE = [1, 30]
keV. The resulting statistical uncertainty for S(0) that

comes from the the cubic polynomial ﬁt is 0.0002× 10−23
MeV fm2, which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of
∼ 0.005%. Obviously, the systematic uncertainty due to
a possibly ill-determined Emax could be much larger, typ-
ically ∼ 1%. In order to reliably extract the derivatives of
the S-factor with respect to the energy, a suﬃciently large
ﬁt interval has to be chosen. However, if the ﬁt interval
is made larger than approximately 30 keV the necessity
of including P -waves in the incoming channel becomes
apparent in Fig. 1. The statistical uncertainties, due to
the polynomial ﬁt, for the ﬁrst and second logarithmic
derivatives of S(0) are 0.02% and 1.18%, respectively.
The polynomial ﬁt uncertainties for remaining quantities
are negligible.

In addition, we varied the Vincent-Phatak (VP)
matching radius Rcut between 5-50 fm to extract uncer-
tainties related to our numerical approach to pp scatter-
ing.

We ﬁnd that Rcut = 35 fm provides robust solutions,
and we conclude that the uncertainty in S(0) due to the

Vincent-Phatak procedure is 0.002 × 10−23 MeV fm2,
which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of ∼ 0.05%.
The three remaining sources of uncertainties that we
explore are related to the χEFT description of the pp-
fusion process. First, there exists a statistical uncer-
tainty due to the non-zero variances of the LECs in the
NNLOsim interactions. Second, the actual choice of in-
put N N data is not uniquely deﬁned. Indeed, it is not
clear what maximum kinetic energy TLab one should con-
sider in the selection of scattering data. This ambiguity
gives rise to a systematic uncertainty. Third, variations
in the regulator cutoﬀs, ΛEFT, of the χEFT description
of the interaction and the currents will induce another
systematic uncertainty.

In the process of propagating statistical uncertainties
we employ well-founded methods for error propagation
(see Ref. [18] for details). We also calculate the corre-
sponding statistical covariance matrix of the observables
and quantities that we compute. To ﬁnd the covariance
Cov(A, B) between two observables, A and B, due to the
the statistical covariances Cov(˜α) of the LECs ˜α, we em-
ploy the linear approximation

Cov(A, B) = JT

ACov(˜α)JB

(17)

where JA is the Jacobian vector of partial derivatives
JA,i = ∂A
, and similarly for JB. We compute pp-
∂ ˜αi
fusion in the S-wave channel only, thus the relevant LECs
are ˜α = (c1, c3, c4, ˜C pp
, ˜C3S1 , C1S0, C3S1, C3S1−3D1, cD).
1S0
Further, we deﬁne the uncertainty in any observable A,
due to the uncertainties in the LECs, as

(cid:112)

σA =

Cov(A, A).

(18)

We use the covariance matrices Cov(˜α) from Ref. [18],
and obtain the necessary derivatives ∂A
via a straight-
∂ ˜αi
forward univariate spline ﬁt to 10 function evaluations of

5

the observable A; changing the LEC ˜αi in the neighbor-
hood of its optimal value. We benchmarked this spline
approximation using the known derivative values of the
deuteron binding energy [18], and found that it was ac-
curate to at least ∼ 0.001%.
From this procedure we ﬁnd that the error in S(0) due
to the statistical uncertainties in the LECs is 0.009 ×
10−23 MeV fm2, which implies a relative uncertainty of
∼ 0.2%. This result is very stable for each of the simulta-
neously optimized NNLO interactions. Propagating also
the statistical errors of gA increases this statistical uncer-
tainty to 0.019 × 10−23 MeV fm2. The statistical uncer-

tainty of GV has a negligible impact on the statistical un-
certainty of S(0). Also, the statistical uncertainties of all
LECs have negligible impact on the logarithmic deriva-
tives of the zero-energy S-factor. The relative uncertain-
ties are; 0.05% in S(cid:48)(0)/S(0) and slightly more , 0.2%,
in S(cid:48)(cid:48)(0)/S(0). Furthermore, the derivatives of S(0) are
very insensitive to changes in the the cutoﬀs ΛEFT and
T max
Lab . The relative uncertainty of the squared overlap
of the deuteron and proton-proton wavefunctions, Λ2, is
∼ 0.05%, and this error is dominated by the LEC vari-
ations. The Λ2 is only somewhat sensitive to variations
in ΛEFT and T max
Lab . For all 42 NNLO interaction that we
employed, we only observed Λ2 in the range 7.064−7.101.
Not surprisingly, the corresponding uncertainty and vari-
ation in δ2B, which is more sensitive to short distance
physics, is much larger. The typical relative uncertainty
due to variations in the LECs is ∼ 5%. Furthermore, δ2B
varies between 0.30% and 0.52% for all NNLO interac-
tions we explored.

As previously mentioned, systematic uncertainties in
the chiral expansion is probed using the family of 42 dif-
ferent simultaneously optimized NNLO potentials. The
range of NNLO predictions for S(0), including the total
statistical uncertainty, is shown in Fig. 2. For a given
cutoﬀ ΛEFT, the width of the green band indicates the
magnitude of all considered uncertainties. The total er-
ror budget is dominated by the statistical uncertainties
in the sub-leading LECs of the chiral expansion and the
axial-vector coupling constant gA. We operate with cur-
rents and interactions that have been optimized simul-
taneously and at the same chiral order, which ensures
consistent renormalization.

E. Correlation analysis

In addition to the diagonal variances, we also compute
the statistical correlations between all relevant pp-fusion
quantities and observables. This study includes masses,
radii, and half-lifes of A = 2, 3, 4 nuclei. Correlations
can possibly reveal more information, but this exercise
also serves as a sanity check of the entire uncertainty
analysis. We should recover correlations expected from
physical arguments. We employ the Jacobian and co-
variance matrices of A = 2, 3, 4 observables with respect
to the the NNLO LECs published in Ref. [18] and con-

6

that the squared radial overlap Λ2 of the deuteron and
relative-proton wave functions does not correlate signif-
icantly with S(0). This indicates that the dependence
of the S-factor on binding energy indeed occurs pre-
dominantly through the phase space. We also observe
that an increase in the deuteron radius would increase
the radial overlap with the proton-proton wave function.
The quadrupole moment of the deuteron and its D-state
probability anti-correlate with Λ2. Here, it is important
to point out that our squared radial overlap only con-
tains the 1B piece of the current operator. Thus it only
measures the overlap between S-wave components. A
smaller D-state probability implies a larger S-state prob-
ability. Consequently, the anti-correlation between Λ2
and Q(2H)/D(2H) mostly traces the same underlying S-
wave component of the deuteron wave function. Finally,
we observe a strong correlation between the strength of
the 2B current and the reduced axial-vector current of
the triton β-decay. In fact, the LEC cD plays a domi-
nant role for both currents. In conclusion, we quantify
all expected correlations and conﬁrm that they emerge
in our statistical analysis.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

FIG. 2. (Color online). The green band indicates the spread
of S(0)-values due to variations in T max
Lab used in the opti-
mization of the NNLO chiral force, as well as the propagated
statistical uncertainties of all LECs and gA, as a function of
the cutoﬀ ΛEFT in the χEFT. ΛEFT was varied between 450
MeV and 600 MeV in steps of 25 MeV. The cutoﬀ in the
current and the interaction sectors were always equal to each
other. This ﬁgure demonstrates that the S-factor is relatively
insensitive to reasonable variations in the cutoﬀ.

We have calculated the pp-fusion S-factor using χEFT
and carried out a state-of-the-art uncertainty analysis by
employing a family of mathematically optimized chiral
potentials at NNLO with consistently renormalized cur-
rents. We focused on the threshold S-factor and have
therefore only considered initial S-wave pp scattering. To
O(α), we obtain a threshold S-factor

S(0) = (4.081+0.024

−0.032) × 10

−23 MeV fm2 ,

tities and the ground state energies (E), point-proton radii
(rpt−p) for A = 2, 3, 4 nuclei as well as the matrix element of
the reduced axial-vector current (E1

tract those with the spline Jacobians extracted in this
work. A graphical representation of the relevant correla-
tions is shown in Fig. 3. This particular correlation ma-
trix is based on the NNLO interaction with ΛEFT = 500
MeV and T max
Lab = 290 MeV. The same pattern emerges
with any of the 42 diﬀerent interactions employed in this
work. As expected from the Q-value dependence of the
phase space volume, the S-factor strongly anticorrelates
with the deuteron ground state energy. It is noteworthy

where we combined,
for simplicity, all uncertainties
by adding them in quadrature, and then taking the
min/max values of the green band in Fig 2. This error
represents all uncertainties originating from χEFT, the
computational method, and the statistical extrapolation
to obtain the threshold value. The eﬀects of higher or-
der electromagnetic contributions that are proportional
to α2 remains to be accounted for. These corrections
lower the threshold S-factor by about a percent [6, 7, 9].
From the energy dependence of these corrections, calcu-
lated in Ref. [6], we estimate a 0.84% reduction in S(0).
The inclusion of these electromagnetic eﬀects leaves the
uncertainties that are due to the strong interaction un-
changed, and the ﬁnal result becomes

Scor(0) = (4.047+0.024

−0.032) × 10

−23 MeV fm2 .

For comparison, the uncertainty presented here is four
times larger than the estimate reported in the pioneer-
ing χEFT calculation in Ref [9]. The comparison of the
central values, however, is not so straightforward since
their calculation includes additional terms in the cur-
rent operator involving additional LECs, namely g4S and

terms to be of the order of 0.1% . However, our value
given in Eq. (20) seems to be slightly higher than the
result obtained by Marcucci et al. even when these cor-
rections are considered. This issue could be related to
the infrared convergence of the matrix elements between
a bound state and a scattering state wave function, as
mentioned brieﬂy in Sec. II B. Additional details will be

ations in ΛEFT.

Our values

Furthermore, our work displays that great care has to
be taken in order to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates
in EFT calculations. While it had previously been under-
stood that a cutoﬀ variation is one necessary part in the
quantiﬁcation of uncertainties, our analysis shows that
potentials that use the same regulator but are optimized
to a diﬀerent energy range of scattering data can lead to
diﬀerent results for electroweak matrix elements. This
is even more remarkable as the various potentials give
the same low-energy observables. We also ﬁnd that the
choice of the ﬁt interval is an important consideration
when using polynomial extrapolation to ﬁnd the thresh-
old S-factor. The appropriate interval has to be chosen
by comparing the statistical errors of the ﬁt for several
diﬀerent ﬁt intervals. To obtain only the threshold S-
factor, S(0), P -wave pp channel should not be necessary
for suﬃciently small ﬁt intervals.

It would be interesting to combine our type of analy-

7

sis with the results obtained using pionless EFT. There,
the S-factor is expressed as a low-energy expansion that
contains only eﬀective range parameters and a few low-
energy constants. Such a parameterization should be
particularly useful in extracting reliable uncertainties for
the energy dependence of the S-factor. Future work also
involves to consider muon-capture by the deuteron. This
two-nucleon process contains information on the ˆdR-term
that is strongly tied to the three-nucleon force. This
study could provide additional important information to
constrain the nuclear many-body Hamiltonian.
