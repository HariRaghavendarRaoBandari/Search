Abstract

We consider the nonlinear derivative Schr¨odinger equation with a quin-
tic nonlinearity, on the one dimensional torus. We exhibit that the nonlin-
ear dynamic properties consist of four frequency modes initially excited,
whose frequencies include the resonant clusters and phase matched reso-
nant interactions of nonlinearities. This phenomena arrests energy trans-
fers between low and high modes, which are quantiﬁed by a growth in the
Sobolev norm.

1 Introduction

In this paper we consider the derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation with

quintic nonlinearity:

(cid:26) i∂u + ∂2

u(0, x) = u0(x),

xu = −iλu2∂xu + µ|u|4u,

(t, x) ∈ R × T,

(1.1)

x ∈ T,

where u = u(t, x) : R × T → C, λ, µ ∈ R, and T = R/2πZ is the torus. Our
aim is to prove that there exist solutions of (1.1) which initially oscillate, and
illustrate the energy transfer from one coupled oscillator to another.

The derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation in the completely integrable

form is written as

i∂u + ∂2

xu = iλ∂x(|u|2u).

(1.2)

As in [10], by using the gauge transform

v(t, x) = u(t, x)e−iG[u],

(1.3)

The equations (1.2) and (1.3) are completely integrable Hamiltonian equations,
having inﬁnitely many conservation laws [2].

The well-posedness results for the equation (1.2), in particular considering
solutions in the Sobolev space H s, were studied in many works (e.g., [10, 16, 17]).
If u0 ∈ H s with s ≥ 1/2, local well-posedness was established by Herr [10]. This
combined with the conservation laws, can often yield the corresponding global
well-posedness result for data in H s for s ≥ 1, which is small in L2. Extension
of the global well-posedness with low regularity data was obtained in the case
s > 1/2 by Su Win [17], by using the I-method developed in [3, 4, 5]. A further
extension was given by [11, 12, 16]. For instance, in [11] Gr¨unrock and Herr
proved the local well-posedness result for initial data in Fourier-Lebesgue space
r is deﬁned by

sure global well-posedness of (1.2) with random initial data in bH s

Later on in [12] Nahmod, Oh, Rey-Bellt and Staﬃlani established the almost
r with s > 1/2
and certain 4/3 < r < 2. Below s = 1/2, in [16] Takaoka obtained the existence
and time continuity of solution in H s with some s < 1/2. We recall that the
initial value problem of the equation (1.2) is ill-posed in H s provided s < 1/2 (see
[1]). In the case of the line case setting, analogous results to the well-posedness
of the equation (1.2) were taken from the references [4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15].

The above technology can also be applied to the equation in (1.1) to obtain
the local and global well-posedness in H s.
Indeed, the initial value problem
(1.1) is locally well-posed in H s for all s ≥ 1/2. In order to capture the global
solution in the energy class s ≥ 1, we need a priori estimate. Formally, solutions
of (1.1) satisfy the conservations laws, that is, the following three quantities are
constant in time:

M [u](t) = 1
E[u](t) = 1
P [u](t) = 1

0 m[u](t, x) dx = M [u](0)
0 e[u](t, x) dx = E[u](0)

L2.

(1.5)

We refer to the cases µ > −5λ2/16 and µ < −5λ2/16 as that the nonlinearity
are respectively defocusing and focusing. By (1.5) and L2-norm conservation
(1.4), in the case µ > −5λ2/16 we have the global well-posedness for any data
in H s for any s ≥ 1, whereas in the case µ ≤ −5λ2/16 we require small in L2.
In the present paper, we concentrate on defocusing case as prototype prob-
lem. The purpose of this paper is to investigation the dynamics on resonant
clusters for (1.1) in the underlying nonlinear energy transfers. Notice that such
energy exchange processes have been seen with the defocusing cubic nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation on two spacial dimension by Colliander, Keel, Staﬃlani,
Takaoka and Tao [6], and with the quintic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation on
one spacial dimension by Gr´ebert and Thomann [7]. We summarize these results
in Remark 1.4 and Remark 1.5, respectively.

Now it is similar in [7], we begin with a resonant set associated to (1.1).
We are interested in whether there exist solutions that have frequencies of the
energy exchange observed between the Fourier modes when only four are initially
excited.
Deﬁnition 1.1. For (M, N ) ∈ Z2 with λ(M + N ) > 0, we will use the notation

α1 = M, α2 = −3M − N,

β2 = −3N − M,
and M∗ = max{|M|, |N|}. With numbers αj, βj (j = 1, 2) satisfying

β1 = N,

γ1 + γ3 6= γ2 + γ4,

(1.6)

for {γ1, γ3} 6= {γ2, γ4}, where each γj is one of α1, α2, β1, β2, a resonant set
Λ = Λ(M, N ) takes the form

Λ = {α1, α2, β1, β2} .

Let PL and PH be frequency cut-oﬀ operators at low and high frequency

modes, respectively, deﬁned as follows:

PLf (ξ) =(cid:26) f (ξ),

0,

if |ξ| . |M + N|,
if |ξ| ≫ |M + N|,

and PH f = (I − PL)f .
Remark 1.1. A typical suﬃcient condition for (1.6) is that M + N = sgnλ and
|M| ≫ 1.

The main result of this paper is the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1 (Case λ = 20(M + N )). Let λ = 20(M + N ), − 5λ2/16 < µ 6=
0, M∗ ≫ |λ| and |µ| ≪ M 2
∗ . There exist c∗ ∈ (0, 1/2) and T > 0 satisfying
T → 0 as 1
|µ| → 0 such that the following holds: there exist 2T -periodic function
K(t) : R → (0, 1) and a solution to (1.1) such that K(0) ≤ 1/2 − c∗ and
K(T ) ≥ 1/2 + c∗ and for all t ∈ R

u(t, x) =Xξ∈Λ

aξ(t)eixξ + e(t, x),

e|t=0 = 0,

where

|aα1 (t)|2 = 2|aα2 (t)| = K(t),

|aβ1(t)|2 = 2|aβ2(t)|2 = 1 − K(t).

Remark 1.2. One notices that the periodicity rate T obtained in Theorem 1.1
c|µ| < T < c
has the bound 1
|µ| , where the constant c > 1 is independent of
λ, µ, M and N . Notice that 1
|µ| ≫ min{ 1

or |λ| ≫ 1. So it is unclear what the time trajectory of e(t, x) in (1.7) describes
beyond the time interval |t| ≪ min{ 1

Remark 1.4. For the defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation on two
spatial dimension:

i∂tu + ∆u = |u|2u,

Derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation on torus

one can obtain the low-to-high energy cascade scenario, see [6]. In the proof,
an instability phenomenon of Arnold diﬀusion phenomena is considered in per-
turbed Hamiltonian systems. Indeed, for any s > 1 and K ≫ 1 ≫ ε there exist
a global solution u(t) of 2d-NLS on T2 and time T satisfying that

ku(0)kHs ≤ ε,

ku(T )kHs ≥ K.

Remark 1.5. In [7], one striking example of a similar situation is considered for
the quintic nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation on one spacial dimension:

(1.8)
For (k, n) ∈ Z2 with k 6= 0, a resonant set Λ1 corresponding to (1.8) is the
following:

xu = ν|u|4u.

i∂tu + ∂2

where

Λ1 = { α′

2 } ,

(α′

1, β′

2) = (n + 3k, n, n + k, n + 4k).

Comparing to the result stated in Theorem 1.1, they obtained dynamical prop-
erties for (1.8) in stronger sense. More precisely, it is obtained that there exist
T > 0, ν0 > 0, 2T -periodic function K : R → (0, 1) with K(0) ≤ 1/4 and
K(T ) ≥ 3/4 so that for all 0 < ν < ν0 and s ∈ R, there exists a solution of (1.8)
satisfying

u(t) = Xξ∈Λ1
for |t| . ν−3/2, where

aξ(t)eixξ +(cid:16)ν1/4 + tν3/2(cid:17) OHs (1)

(1.9)

|an+3k(t)|2 = 2|an(t)| = K(νt),

|an+k(t)|2 = 2|an+4k(t)|2 = 1 − K(νt).

The proof is centered on the resonant normal form approach. The formula (1.7)
looks very similar to that of (1.9), but this conveys diﬀerent information because
of obstructions by the derivative nonlinearity in (1.1).

We now turn to equation adjusting the amplitude scaling:

u(t, x) 7→ v(t, x) =r 20(M + N )

λ′

u(t, x),

λ′(M + N ) > 0,

which transforms the equation (1.1) in the case λ = 20(M + N ) to the following:

(1.10)

Apply this to Theorem 1.1, we obtain the immediate corollary, which is equiv-
alent to the counterpart of Theorem 1.1.

Theorem 1.1 is obtained by analyzing an inﬁnitely dimensional system of
ordinary diﬀerential equations that include the resonant components on nonlin-
earity of (1.1). We ﬁrst make the Fourier transform to the equation (1.1) and
build a resonant approximation model (toy model), which is an ordinary dif-
ferential system. This is accomplished by investigating the long time dynamics
of toy model. The error estimate is proved to approximate well the solution of
(1.1) by that of the toy model by using the bootstrap argument.
Notation 1.1. We prefer to use the notation h·i = (1 + | · |2)1/2. The over dot
˙a(t) denotes the time derivative of a(t).
The Fourier transform with respect to the space variable (discrete Fourier

transform) is deﬁned by

We use c, C to denote various constants that does not depend on λ, µ, M
and N . We use A . B to denote A ≤ CB for some constant C > 0. Similarly,
we write A ≪ B to mean A ≤ cB for some small constant c > 0.
For complex-valued n functions f1, f2, . . . , fn deﬁned on the set Z of inte-
gers, we write the discrete convolution (convolution sum) [f1 ∗ f2 ∗ . . . ∗ fn](ξ)

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

whereP∗ denotes a summation over the set where ξ1 + ξ2 + . . . + ξn = ξ.

In Section 2, we reduce
the equation (1.1) to that for the Fourier coeﬃcients, by taking the advantage
of conservation laws (1.4). In Section 3, we construct an appropriate ordinary
diﬀerential equation (ODE) system as theoretical toy model for (1.1). In Section
4, we solve the ODE system.
In Section 5, the equation that we derived in
the previous section should approximate the dynamics of the ﬁrst diﬀerential
equation (1.1).

2 Fourier Ansatz

In this section we derive the resonant approximation model related to (1.1).

We consider the smooth solutions thought the paper, and write

u(t, x) =Xξ∈Z

aξ(t)ei(xξ+tξ2).

Substituting this into the equation (1.1) and using

ξ2
1 − ξ2

2 + ξ2

3 − ξ2 = 2(ξ1 − ξ2)(ξ1 − ξ) = 2(ξ3 − ξ2)(ξ3 − ξ),

for ξ = ξ1 − ξ2 + ξ3, we obtain the equation for aξ = aξ(t):

by splitting the cubic convolution sum on ξ = ξ1 − ξ2 + ξ3 into two types of

(2.4)

Note that (ξ1 − ξ2)(ξ1 − ξ) 6= 0 when {ξ1, ξ3} ∩ {ξ2, ξ} = ∅ in the third term
on the right-hand side of (2.4). When (ξ1 − ξ2)(ξ1 − ξ4) 6= 0, it oscillates in
space-time at diﬀerent frequencies, which illustrates hidden smoothing eﬀect.
Thus for the third term on the right-hand side of (2.4), we divide the sum into
two cases: {ξ1, ξ3} ∩ {ξ2, ξ} = ∅ and {ξ1, ξ3} ∩ {ξ2, ξ} 6= ∅, then

We also divide the sum in the last term on the right-hand side of (2.4) into
two cases; {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} = {ξ2, ξ4, ξ} and {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} 6= {ξ2, ξ4, ξ}. On the

ξ1 = ξ, {ξ3, ξ5} = {ξ2, ξ4}, (ii) ξ1 6= ξ, {ξ1, ξ5} = {ξ2, ξ4}, (iii) ξ1 6= ξ, ξ3 6=

The cubic interactions through resonance in the ﬁrst term on the right-hand

section, we seek the contribution of quintic resonant interactions to the last term
on the right-hand side of (2.5).

3 Toy model

In this section we shall construct resonant, ﬁnite dimensional truncation

model to (2.5). Let

λ = 20(α1 + β1) = 20(M + N ).

We start out by referring to the observation on the resonant set used in [7], which
can be helpful in predicting the resonant set related to the equation (2.5).
Lemma 3.1 (Gr´ebert-Thomann [7, Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2]). Assume that ξj ∈
Z (1 ≤ j ≤ 6) satisfy

ξ1 + ξ3 + ξ5 = ξ2 + ξ4 + ξ6,
4 + ξ2
ξ2
1 + ξ2
6 ,

5 = ξ2

3 + ξ2

2 + ξ2

and {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} 6= {ξ2, ξ4, ξ6}. Then {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} ∩ {ξ2, ξ4, ξ6} = ∅. Moreover
the cardinal of {ξj | 1 ≤ j ≤ 6} is greater than or equal to 4.

Considering the inﬂuence by the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (2.5),

we deﬁne the resonant interaction set

Λ∗ = {{α1, α1, α2}, {β1, β1, β2}} ,

where αj and βj are deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1.1. We will use the notation

{{ξ1, ξ3, ξ5}, {ξ2, ξ4, ξ}} = Λ∗

to represent that two of ξ1, ξ3, ξ5 are α1, one of ξ1, ξ3, ξ5 are α2, two of ξ2, ξ4, ξ
are β1, one of ξ2, ξ4, ξ is β2, and its symmetrical objects.

of (2.5) by

One of the most important features of the above ODE system is the following

Lemma 3.2. Let {cξ}ξ∈Λ be a solution to (3.1)-(3.2) on the time interval I.
Then we have the relations:

dt(cid:0)|cα2 (t)|2 + |cβ2(t)|2(cid:1) = 0,
dt(cid:0)|cα1(t)|2 − 2|cα2(t)|2(cid:1) = 0,

Hence the argument used in above gives

which concludes the proof of (3.5).
Remark 3.1. The conservation laws in (3.3)-(3.5) are used to the study of prop-
erties of the system of (3.1) including the global existence results. In particular,
the ODE system (3.1)-(3.2) has global solutions. We will show that the system
has periodic orbits in times.

Let us set data {aξ(0)} in (3.2) where

|aα1 (0)|2 + |aβ1(0)|2 = 2|aα2(0)|2 + 2|aβ2(0)|2 = 1,
|aα1 (0)|2 − 2|aα2(0)|2 = |aβ1(0)|2 − 2|aβ2(0)|2 = 0.

By Lemma 3.2 and Remark 3.1, we have that for all t ∈ R,
|cα1 (t)|2 + |cβ1(t)|2 = 2|cα2(t)|2 + 2|cβ2(t)|2 = 1,
|cα1 (t)|2 − 2|cα2 (t)|2 = |cβ1(t)|2 − 2|cβ2(t)|2 = 0.

We now write

|cα1 (t)|2 = K(t),

|cα2|2 =

|cβ1(t)|2 = 1 − K(t),

The equation (3.1) has a gauge freedom. On writing

where

Let us discuss the contribution of the right-hand of (3.12).

Lemma 3.3. Let

|dβ1 (t)|2 = 1 − K(t),

Proof. By symmetry, it suﬃces to consider the case (ξ1, ξ3, ξ5, ξ2, ξ4, ξ) =
(α1, α1, α2, β1, β1, β2).
First one notices that

(3.13)

From the crucial fact that (α1, α2, β1, β2) = (M, −3M − N, N, −3N − M ), we
see that the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (3.13) is zero. From the identity

where θξ(t) ∈ R. From (3.9) and (3.10), we may assume that 0 < Iξ(t) < 1 (see

deﬁne

I = t(Iα1 , Iα2 , Iβ1 , Iβ2 ),

and deﬁne new variables

φ = t(φ1, φ2, φ3, φ4),

J = t(J1, J2, J3, J4),

As discussed in Remark 4.1, the structure of (4.1) and (4.2) is reminiscent of
what the function K = K(t) constraints dynamics of (φj , Jj) as well as (θj, Ij ).
Actually, we will interest in the periodic solutions (θj, Ij). We achieve this by
ﬁnding a periodic solution K(t) for the ODE system on (φ1, J1).

Proposition 4.1. There exists T > 0 so that (φ1, K) is a 2T -periodic solution
of (4.4) and

Moreover, µT is a constant independent of µ.

K(0) + K(T ) = 1.

Derivative nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation on torus

17

Proof. The existence of a periodic solution for (4.4) is similar to the one exposed
in [7, Proposition 4.2]. The intuition is that in the region (φ1, K) ∈ [−π, π] ×
(0, 1), the equilibrium points associated with (4.4) are ω0 = (0, 1/2) and ω± =
(±π, 1/2). At the point ω±, we have that the ﬂow obeys the Hamiltonian (4.3)

We use the rescaling theorem done by t 7→ µt to concrete µT as a constant
Once one has the periodic solution K(t) in Proposition 4.1, one can obtain

the following proposition.

Proposition 4.2. There exist c∗ > 0 and c > 0 that are independent of
λ, µ, M, N so that the following holds: there exist 2T -periodic function K(t) :
R → (0, 1) and solutions {cξ}ξ∈Λ to the ODE system (3.1)-(3.2) such that
µT = c. Moreover, K(0) ≤ 1/2 − c∗ and K(T ) ≥ 1/2 + c∗ and for all t ∈ R

|cα1(t)|2 = 2|cα2(t)|2 = K(t),

|cβ1 (t)|2 = 2|cβ2(t)|2 = 1 − K(t).

5 Error estimates

In this section, we shall evaluate the residual terms aξ(t), ξ 6∈ Λ for (2.5).
Recall M∗ = max{|M|,|N|}. First we show the conservation laws.

Lemma 5.1. Consider a global solution u(t) to (1.1) as formed in (2.1) satis-
fying

and

aξ(0) = 0

for all ξ 6∈ Λ,

|aα1 (0)|2 = 2|aα2(0)|2 = K(0),

Then we have that

Proposition 5.1. Let 0 < ε ≤ 1
Assume that M∗ ≫ |M + N|, |µ| ≪ M 2

Without loss of generality, we consider only the case t ≥ 0. Thanks to
Duhamel’s formula of (5.5), one can write the solution aξ(t) of (5.5) as the
integral form:

bξ(t) =

For this purpose, we have the several lemmas. Let us ﬁrst consider the term

N2.

Lemma 5.2. Assume the same hypotheses of Proposition 5.1. Then

Proof of Lemma 5.2. One employees the constrain in (1.6). Because ξ1 + ξ3 =
ξ2 + ξ4 and {ξ1, ξ3}∩{ξ2, ξ4} = ∅, there exists some 1 ≤ j ≤ 4 such that ξj 6∈ Λ.
Hence by (5.6) we have that

Next we illustrate the estimate for N3. Before the estimate on N3, we show

2 + ξ2

the following lemma.
Lemma 5.3. Assume that M∗ ≫ |M + N|, ξ1 + ξ3 + ξ5 = ξ2 + ξ4 + ξ6 and
4 + ξ2
|ξ2
1 − ξ2
∗ , ξj ∈ Λ for all 1 ≤ j ≤ 5, then {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} =
{ξ2, ξ4, ξ6} or ξ6 ∈ Λ.
Proof of Lemma 5.3. By symmetry we assume |M| ≥ |N| which leads M∗ = |M|.
Put

N = (M +N )−M, −3M−N = −(M +N )−2M, −3N−M = −3(M +N )+2M,
we have ηj ∈ {1, −1, 2, −2} for 1 ≤ j ≤ 5.
In this case, since η3 + η5 = η4 + η6, we have

When {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} ∩ {ξ2, ξ4, ξ6} 6= ∅, we may assume ξ1 = ξ2 by symmetry.

1 −

0 = η2

3 + η2

4 − η2

5 − η2
which implies {ξ3, ξ5} = {ξ4, ξ6}.
When ξ6 6∈ Λ, {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} ∩ {ξ2, ξ4, ξ6} = ∅ and {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} 6= {ξ2, ξ4, ξ6},
then there exists pairs {ξi, ξj} ⊂ {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} or {ξi, ξj} ⊂ {ξ2, ξ4, ξ6} such that
i 6= j, but ξi = ξj. By symmetry we may assume i = 1 and j = 3. Note

6 = 2(η3 − η4)(η3 − η6),

2η2

1 + η2

5 = η2

2 + η2

4 + (2η1 + η5 − η2 − η4)2.

If {η1, η5} ⊂ {±1}, then {η2, η4} ⊂ {±1}, η1 = η5 and η2 = η4 = −η1, since
3 = 12 + 12 + 12, which implies |η6| = 5, but this contradicts with η6 ∈ {±1}.
If η1 ∈ {±1} and η5 ∈ {±2}, then η2 = −η1 (by symmetry) and {η4, η6} =
{−η1, −η5}, since 6 = 12 + 12 + 22. Then 2η1 + η5 = 0 holds, which implies
ξ6 ∈ Λ by (3.14) and (3.15). This is a contradiction.
If η1 ∈ {±2} and η5 ∈ {±1}, then η2 = −η1 (by symmetry) and {η4, η6} =
{−η1, −η5} since 9 is expressed in sum of square by 12 + 22 + 22, which contra-
dicts with 2η1 + η5 = 0 as same as above.
If {η1, η5} ⊂ {±2}, then η1 = η5 and η2 = η4 = η6 = −η1 since 12 = 22+22+22,
which implies 3η1 = −3η1. This is a contradiction.

Hence we conclude that {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} = {ξ2, ξ4, ξ6}.
By using this lemma, we obtain the estimate on the term N3.

Lemma 5.4. Assume the same hypotheses of Proposition 5.1. Then,

Proof of Lemma 5.4. We split the sum into two cases:

(i) at least, one of ξj are not elements of Λ,
(ii) ξj ∈ Λ for all 1 ≤ j ≤ 5.
In the ﬁrst case (i), we see that the contribution to the left-hand side of (5.7)

is bounded by

In the second case (ii), we may assume ξj ∈ Λ for 1 ≤ j ≤ 5, without loss
of generality. Observe that by Lemma 5.3, if ξ1 + ξ3 + ξ5 = ξ2 + ξ4 + ξ and
|ξ2
1 −ξ2
∗ , then {ξ1, ξ3, ξ5} = {ξ2, ξ4, ξ}, but it obviously
contradicts with the restriction of the formula of N3. This leads to the bound

∗ from (5.1) and (5.2).

(5.10)

Proof of Lemma 5.6. We divide the sum on (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) 6∈ Λ∗∗ into three cases:

(i) ξj ∈ Λ for all 1 ≤ j ≤ 3,
(ii) at least, two of ξj are not elements of Λ,

(iii) two of ξj are elements of Λ, one of ξj is not elements of Λ, |ξ−ξ1| ≥ M∗/100

and |ξ − ξ3| ≥ M∗/100.
In the case (i), we see that

|(ξ − ξ1)(ξ − ξ3)| = |(ξ2 − ξ3)(ξ2 − ξ1)| & M 2
∗ ,

(5.11)

since M∗ ≫ |λ| ∼ |M + N| and the constrain {ξ1, ξ3} ∩ {ξ2, ξ} = ∅. As we saw
in (5.8), the following inequality holds:

Using integration by parts, it follows that the contribution of this case to the
left-hand side of (5.10) is bounded by

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ˙Φ1(s, ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) & |(ξ1 − ξ2)(ξ1 − ξ)| .

the second term of (5.12) is bounded by

Since ξ1 ∈ Λ and constrain (1.6), we have that at least one of ξ′

j is elements of

It thus remains to establish the bound in the case (iii). As in the case (i)
above, by using (5.11), it follows that the contribution of this case to (5.14) has
the same bound as in (5.12). The estimate for the ﬁrst term of (5.14) is same,
namely we have the bound (5.13). For the second term in (5.14), we divide two
cases (using symmetry):

(i)” the diﬀerential operator ∂s falls in bξj with ξj ∈ Λ,
(ii)” the diﬀerential operator ∂s falls in bξj with ξj 6∈ Λ.
In the case (i)”, the sum in ˙N1(s, ξj ) contains at least one frequency elements
not in Λ. Thus as same as in the case (ii), we have that the contribution of this
case to (5.14) is bounded by

Note that (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) ∈ Λ∗∗(ξ) implies that

|ξ| ∼ |ξ2| ∼ M∗

and there is one of ξj 6∈ Λ such that (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) ∈ Λ∗∗(ξ), which implies that
the ﬁrst term of (5.17) is eliminated. A direct computation allows us to obtain
(5.17).

Proof of Theorem 1.1. The proof of the corollary follows by Propositions 4.1,
4.2 and 5.2.
