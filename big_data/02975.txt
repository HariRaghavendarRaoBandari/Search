QUASI-LOCAL ENERGY WITH RESPECT TO
DE SITTER/ANTI-DE SITTER REFERENCE

PO-NING CHEN, MU-TAO WANG, AND SHING-TUNG YAU

Abstract. This article considers the quasi-local conserved quantities with respect to
a reference spacetime with a cosmological constant. We follow the approach developed
by the authors in [25, 26, 7] and deﬁne the quasi-local energy as diﬀerences of surface
Hamiltonians. The ground state for the gravitational energy is taken to be a reference
conﬁguration in the de Sitter (dS) or Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This deﬁnes the
quasi-local energy with respect to the reference spacetime and generalizes our previous
deﬁnition with respect to the Minkowski spacetime. Through an optimal isometric em-
bedding into the reference spacetime, the Killing ﬁelds of the reference spacetime are
transplanted back to the surface in the physical spacetime to complete the deﬁnitions of
quasi-local conserved quantities. We also compute how the corresponding total conserved
quantities evolve under the Einstein equation with a cosmological constant.

1. Introduction

In [25, 26, 7], the authors developed the theory of quasi-local energy (mass) and quasi-
local conserved quantities in general relativity with respect to the Minkowski spacetime
reference. In view of recent astronomical observations, the current article embarks on the
study of the corresponding theory with respect to a reference spacetime with a non-zero
cosmological constant. In particular, the quasi-local energy and quasi-local conserved quan-
tities with respect to the dS or AdS spacetime are deﬁned in this article. The construction,
similar to the Minkowski reference case, is based on the Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of the
gravitational action and optimal isometric embeddings. However, the result, not only is
more complicated, but also reveals new phenomenon due to the nonlinear nature of the
reference spacetime. The construction employs ideas developed by the authors in [24] (see
also [22]) for quasi-local mass with respect to the hyperbolic reference.

In the following, we review the deﬁnition of the quasi-local energy-momentum in [25, 26]
with respect to the Minkowski spacetime. The main motivation of this deﬁnition is the
rigidity property that surfaces in the Minkowski spacetime should have zero mass. As a
result, all possible isometric embeddings X of the surface into R3,1 are considered and an

energy is assigned to each pair (X, T0) of an isometric embedding X and a constant future
timelike unit vector ﬁeld T0 in R3,1.

Let Σ be a closed embedded spacelike 2-surface in a spacetime. We assume the mean
curvature vector H of Σ is spacelike and the normal bundle of Σ is oriented. The data
used in the deﬁnition of the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass is the triple (σ,|H|, αH ), in which
σ is the induced metric on Σ, |H| is the norm of the mean curvature vector and αH is the
connection one-form of the normal bundle with respect to the mean curvature vector

Given an isometric embedding X : Σ → R3,1 and a constant future timelike unit vector
ﬁeld T0 in R3,1, let bX be the projection of X onto the orthogonal complement of T0. We
denote the induced metric, the second fundamental form, and the mean curvature of the
image by ˆσab, ˆhab, and bH, respectively. The Wang-Yau quasi-local energy with respect to

where θ = sinh−1(
respect to σ and τ = −hX, T0i is the time function.
In [25, 26], it is proved that, E(Σ, X, T0) ≥ 0 if Σ bounds a spacelike hypersurface in N ,
the dominant energy condition holds in N , and the pair (X, T0) is admissible. The Wang-
Yau quasi-local mass is deﬁned to be the minimum of the quasi-local energy E(Σ, X, T0)
among all admissible pairs (X, T0). In particular, for a surface in the Minkowski spacetime,
its Wang-Yau mass is zero. However, for surfaces in a general spacetime, it is not clear
which isometric embedding would minimize the quasi-local energy. To ﬁnd the isometric
embedding that minimizes the quasi-local energy, we study the Euler-Lagrange equation
for the critical point of the Wang-Yau energy. It is the following fourth order nonlinear
elliptic equation (as an equation for τ )

coupled with the isometric embedding equation for X. (1.1) is referred to as the optimal
isometric embedding equation.

The data for the image surface of the isometric embedding X in the Minkowski spacetime
can be used to simplify the expressions for the quasi-local energy and the optimal isometric
embedding equation. Denote the norm of the mean curvature vector and the connection
one-form in mean curvature gauge of X(Σ) in R3,1 by |H0| and αH0, respectively. Let
θ0 = sinh−1(
|H0|√1+|∇τ |2 ). We have the following identities relating the geometry of the

The second identity states that a surface inside R3,1 is a critical point of the quasi-local
energy with respect to other isometric embeddings back to R3,1. This can be proved by
either the positivity of the quasi-local energy or a direct computation. We substitute these
relations into the expression for E(Σ, X, T0) and the optimal isometric embedding equation,
and rewrite them in terms of a function ρ and a one-form j with

The article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we gather results for the geometry of
surfaces in the reference spacetime (dS or AdS). In Section 3, we derive a conservation
law for surfaces in the reference spacetime. The conservation law is used in Section 4 to
deﬁne the quasi-local energy.
In Section 5, the ﬁrst variation of the quasi-local energy
is derived. In Section 6, the second variation of the quasi-local energy is computed and
we prove that a surface in the static slice of the reference spacetime is a local minimum
of its own quasi-local energy. In Section 7, we deﬁne the quasi-local conserved quantities
and evaluate their limits for an asymptotically AdS initial data, and compute how these
conserved quantities evolve under the Einstein equation with a cosmological constant.

2. Geometry of surfaces in the reference spacetime

In this section, we gather results for the geometry of surfaces in the reference spacetime,
which refers to the dS spacetime or AdS spacetime throughout the article. In a static chart
(t, x1, x2, x3) of the reference spacetime, the metric is of the form

ˇg = −Ω2dt2 + gijdxidxj

(2.1)

where gij is the hyperbolic metric for the AdS spacetime, or the round metric on S3 for the
dS spacetime, and Ω is the corresponding static potential. The metric is normalized such
that the scalar curvature of gij is 6κ where κ is 1 or −1. Denote the covariant derivative
of the static slice by ¯∇ and that of the reference spacetime by D.

The static equation reads:

(− ¯∆Ω)gij + ¯∇i ¯∇jΩ − ΩRicij = 0

where Ricij is the Ricci curvature of the metric gij. In our case, a static slice is a space
form and gij and Ω satisfy

¯∇2Ω = −κΩg.

Consider a surface Σ in the reference spacetime deﬁned by an embedding X from an
abstract surface Σ0 into the reference spacetime. In the static chart, we denote the com-
ponents of X by (τ, X 1, X 2, X 3) and refer to τ as the time function. Let σ be the induced
metric on Σ, H0 be the mean curvature vector of Σ and J0 be the reﬂection of H0 through
the light cone in the normal bundle of Σ. Denote the covariant derivative with respect to
the induced metric σ by ∇.
Given an orthonormal frame {e3, e4} of the normal bundle of Σ in the reference spacetime
where e3 is spacelike and e4 is future timelike, we deﬁne the connection one-form associated
to the frame

3. A conservation law

Proposition 2.2 leads to the following conservation law for surfaces in the dS or AdS

spacetime. This generalizes Proposition 3.1 of [26].

Proposition 3.1. For any surface Σ in the reference spacetime, we have the following
conservation law:

To deﬁne the quasi-local energy, the right hand side of the conservation law is rewritten

in terms of the mean curvature gauge in the following proposition.

conservation law in Proposition 3.1 reads

4. Definition of the Quasi-local energy

Now we consider a surface Σ in a general spacetime N . As in [26, 27], a quasi-local energy
is assigned to each pair of an isometric embedding X of Σ into the reference spacetime,
and an observer T0 (a future timelike Killing ﬁeld).
Isometric embeddings into the dS
spacetime and the AdS spacetime are studied in [17]. The set of observers is simply the
orbit of ∂
∂t under the isometry group of the reference spacetime. See Section 7.2 for more
details in the AdS case.

Let Σ be a surface in a spacetime N . We assume the mean curvature vector H of Σ
is spacelike and the normal bundle of Σ is oriented. The data we use for deﬁning the
quasi-local energy is the triple (σ,|H|, αH ) where σ is the induced metric, |H| is the norm
of the mean curvature vector, and αH is the connection one-form of the normal bundle
with respect to the mean curvature vector

The quasi-local energy is invariant with respect to the isometry of the reference spacetime
if an isometry is applied to both X and T0. As a result, in studying the variation of E, it
suﬃces to consider the quasi-local energy with respect to a ﬁxed T0 = ∂
∂t .

The quasi-local energy is expressed in terms of the diﬀerence of two integrals. We refer
to the ﬁrst integral in (4.1) as the reference Hamiltonian and the second integral in (4.1)
as the physical Hamiltonian.

5. First variation of the quasi-local energy

In this section, we compute the ﬁrst variation of the quasi-local energy. It suﬃces to

consider the variation of the isometric embedding X while ﬁxing T0 = ∂
∂t .

Deﬁnition 5.1. An optimal isometric embedding for the data (σ,|H|, αH ) is an isometric
embedding X0 of σ into the reference spacetime (dS or AdS) that is a critical point of the
quasi-local energy E(Σ, X, ∂

∂t ) among all nearby isometric embeddings X of σ.

For the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy with the Minkowski reference, the ﬁrst variation of
the quasi-local energy is computed in Section 6 of [26]. The computation of the variation
of the physical Hamiltonian is straightforward and the main diﬃculty is to evaluate the
variation of the reference Hamiltonian. In [26], this is done by computing the variation of
the total mean curvature of a surface in R3 with respect to a variation of the metric. This
becomes more complicated here since the isometric embedding equation also involves the
static potential when the reference is either the dS or AdS spacetime. Instead of following
the approach in [26], we derive the ﬁrst variation by an alternative approach used in [5].
The idea there is to consider the image X(Σ) in the reference spacetime as a new physical
surface and show that it is naturally a critical point of the quasi-local energy with respect
to other isometric embeddings into the reference spacetime. We ﬁrst derive the following
result for surfaces in the reference spacetime.

Theorem 5.2. The identity isometric embedding for a surface Σ in the reference spacetime
is a critical point of its own quasi-local energy. Namely, suppose Σ is in the reference
spacetime deﬁned by an embedding X0. Consider a family of isometric embeddings X(s),
−ǫ < s < ǫ such that X(0) = X0. Then we have

and αH0 are ﬁxed at their values at the initial surface X0(Σ) and only τ and Ω are varied.

compare with the variation of H1 using the identities in Section 2.

It is convenient to rewrite H1 and H2 in terms of the following two quantities: A =

6. Second variation and local minimum of the quasi-local energy

First, we prove the following lemma about surfaces in the static slice of the reference

spacetime. A similar and related inequality was obtained in [15].

Lemma 6.1. Let Σ be a convex surface in the static slice of the reference spacetime. Let
H0 and hab be the mean curvature and second fundamental form of Σ. Then for any smooth

In particular, ¯f Ω is another static potential (2.2).

minimum of its own quasi-local energy.
Theorem 6.2. Suppose X(s) = (τ (s), X i(s)), s ∈ (−ǫ, ǫ) is a family of isometric embed-

diﬀerentiate (5.10) one more time. Only the derivative of the term 1
survives after the evaluation at s = 0. We thus conclude that both sides of (6.7) are the

Finally, we evaluate the second variation of the quasi-local energy and show that for

surfaces with spherically symmetric data, namely

σ = r2˜σ,

|H| = c > 0 and αH = 0,

there is an isometric embedding into the hyperbolic space H3 which minimizes the quasi-
local energy with AdS spacetime reference.
Theorem 6.3. Let Σ be a surface in spacetime N with data (σ,|H|, αH ). We assume the
mean curvature vector H of Σ is spacelike and αH = 0. Furthermore, we assume that the
image of an isometric embedding of σ into H3 is convex.

(i) Suppose the mean curvature of the isometric embedding into H3 satisﬁes H0 ≥ |H|.
Then there is an isometric embedding into H3 which is a critical point of the quasi-
local energy with AdS spacetime reference.

(ii) Suppose the data on Σ is spherically symmetric. Then the above critical point is a

local minimum of the quasi-local energy with AdS spacetime reference.

Proof. For an isometric embedding into H3 as a static slice of AdS, τ = 0 and the quasi-local
energy (4.1) is simply

1

8πZ Ω(H0 − |H|)dΣ.

(6.15)
The isometric embedding into H3 is unique up to an isometry of H3. If H0 = |H| every-
where, then the integral vanishes for any choice of static potential. Otherwise, the integral
depends on the isometry which may pick up a diﬀerent choice of the static potentials Ω.
The choice of the static potential corresponds to choosing a base point on H3. Hence, the

integralR Ω(H0 −|H|)dΣ becomes a function on H3. Assuming H0 ≥ |H| and they are not

equal everywhere, this function is positive, proper and convex since the static potentials
approach inﬁnity at the inﬁnity of H3. Hence, there is a unique choice of Ω that minimizes
the quasi-local energy among all the static potentials. Equivalently, if we pick a ﬁxed static

We conclude that the ﬁrst term vanishes from (6.16). We conclude that δ|H0| = 0 as in
the proof of Theorem 6.2. This proves part (i).
For part (ii), it is easy to see that for surfaces with spherical symmetric data, the mean
curvature of the image of isometric embeddings into H3 is constant and the critical point
obtained in part (i) is precisely such that Ω is constant on the image.

δ ˆA = δbX.

As in the proof of Theorem 6.2, we consider the family A(s) of isometries of the AdS
spacetime whose restriction to the static slice is the family ˆA(s) and consider the following
family of isometric embeddings of σ into the AdS spacetime:

˘X(s) = A−1(s)X(s).

As in the proof of Theorem 6.2, we apply Theorem 5.4 to each of X(s)(Σ) and ˘X(s)(Σ)
and use (6.8), (6.9) and (6.10) to diﬀerentiate (5.10) one more time. In this case, H0 6= |H|

The second and third term on the right hand side of (6.20) are manifestly non-negative
since H0 ≥ |H|. The last term is non-negative as in the proof of Theorem 6.2. It suﬃces
to show that the ﬁrst term is also non-negative. We decompose δ2 ˘X i into its tangential
and normal parts to X(0)(Σ). Let

δ2 ˘X i = αa ∂bX i(0)

Since Ω is a constant on the image of bX, integrating over Σ gives

Z (δ2 ˘X i ¯∇iΩ)(H0 − |H|)dΣ =Z βν(Ω)(H0 − |H|)dΣ.

In terms of α and β, the second variation of the isometric embedding equation is

2βhab + ∇aαb + ∇bαa = 2Ω2δτaδτb.
Taking the trace of (6.21) and integrating, we conclude that

Z βH0dΣ ≥ 0.

In particular,R βdΣ ≥ 0 since H0 is a constant. It follows that

Z βν(Ω)(H0 − |H|)dΣ ≥ 0

since ν(Ω), H0 and |H| are all positive constants.

7. Quasi-local/total conserved quantities

The reference spacetime admits 10 dimensional Killing ﬁelds. In addition to the quasi-
local energy corresponding to observers, a quasi-local conserved quantity corresponding to
each Killing ﬁeld is deﬁned. We follow the approach in [7] to use an isometric embedding
to transplant Killing ﬁelds of the reference spacetime back to the 2-surface of interest in
a physical spacetime. The quasi-local energy can be written in terms of the quasi-local
energy density ρ in (5.9) and the quasi-local momentum density j, see (7.1) below.
In
the second subsection, we evaluate the limits of the quasi-local conserved quantities on an
asymptotically AdS initial data set and prove that the limits agree with the total conserved
quantities of such an initial data. In the third subsection, we show that the limit of the
quasi-local energy is the linear function dual to the total conserved quantities and in the last
subsection, we compute the evolution of the total conserved quantities under the Einstein
equation.

7.1. Quasi-local conserved quantities. We rewrite the quasi-local energy in terms of ρ
(5.9) using the expression (4.2). This is a straightforward computation involving only basic
identities of the inverse hyperbolic functions. For the case Ω = 1, this is carried out in
details in Section 4 of [5] for the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. After some simpliﬁcations,
the quasi-local energy in terms of ρ is

E(Σ, X, T0)

) − αH0(Ω2∇τ ) + αH(Ω2∇τ )(cid:21) dΣ

Let j be the quasi-local momentum density one-form:
ρdiv(Ω2∇τ )

j = ρΩ2dτ − d[sinh−1(

|H0||H|

)] − αH0 + αH .

(7.1)

We are ready to deﬁne the quasi-local conserved quantity with respect to a pair (X, T0)

and a Killing ﬁeld K.

Deﬁnition 7.1. The quasi-local conserved quantity of Σ with respect to a pair (X, T0) and
a Killing ﬁeld K in the reference spacetime is

E(Σ, X, T0, K) = −

8πZΣhhK, T0iρ + j(K ⊤)i dΣ

(7.2)

where K ⊤ is the tangential part of K to X(Σ), and ρ deﬁned in (5.9) and j deﬁned in
(7.1).

In particular, when K = T0, E(Σ, X, T0, T0) recovers the quasi-local energy E(Σ, X, T0)

since the tangential part of T0 to X(Σ) is −Ω2∇τ and hT0, T0i = −Ω2.
7.2. Total conserved quantities for an asymptotically AdS spacetime. In this
subsection, we evaluate the large sphere limit of the quasi-local conserved quantities for
asymptotically AdS initial data sets and show that their limits recover the total conserved

quantities for asymptotically AdS initial data sets considered by previous authors. See for
example [1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 11, 13, 14, 18, 28, 29].

We ﬁrst review the AdS spacetime and its Killing ﬁelds. Take R3,2 with the coordinate

system (y0, y1, y2, y3, y4) and the metric

AdS can be identiﬁed with the timelike hypersurface given by

−(dy4)2 +

(dyi)2 − (dy0)2.

−(y4)2 +

(yi)2 − (y0)2 = −1.

Note that the group SO(3, 2) leaves this hypersurface invariant and thus the isometry
group of AdS is SO(3, 2), which is 10 dimensional.

The static chart of AdS comes from the following parametrization:

3Xi=1
3Xi=1

yi = r˜xi

y0 =p1 + r2 sin t
y4 =p1 + r2 cos t.

pi = yi ∂

∂y0 + y0 ∂
∂yi ,

ci = yi ∂

∂y4 + y4 ∂
∂yi ,
∂yj .

We have the following basis for the Killing vector ﬁelds: the time translating Killing ﬁeld
∂
∂t = y4 ∂

∂y4 , the ﬁrst set of boost ﬁelds

∂y0 − y0 ∂

(7.3)

(7.4)

the second set of boost ﬁelds

and the rotation Killing ﬁelds jk = ǫijkyi ∂

In the static chart of AdS, the metric is of the form

−(1 + r2)dt2 +

dr2
1 + r2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2).

The static slice t = 0 is totally geodesics and the induced metric is the hyperbolic metric.
We consider asymptotically AdS initial data sets as follows:

Deﬁnition 7.2. An initial data (M, g, k) is said to be asymptotically AdS if there exists a
compact subset K of M such that M\K is diﬀeomorphic to a ﬁnite union of ends ∪(H3\Bα)
where each Bα is a geodesic ball in H3. On each end, under the diﬀeomorphism, the metric
g takes the form:

g = grrdr2 + 2gradrdua + gabduadub,

Let Σr be the coordinate spheres on an end of an asymptotically AdS initial data set.
In the following theorem, we evaluate the limit of the quasi-local conserved quantities in
terms of the expansion of g and k.

Theorem 7.3. Let (M, g, k) be an asymptotically AdS initial data set as in Deﬁnition

Proof. The computation of |H| is the same as in Lemma 3.1 of [8] for an asymptotically
hyperbolic initial data set. The only diﬀerence is that, in the asymptotically AdS case,
hH, e4i = O(r−3) and does not contribute. For αH, we recall from [27] that

where

(αH )a = −k(e3, ∂a) + ∇aθ

|H|

The formula follows since the leading term of e3 is r ∂

(cid:3)

We are now ready to evaluate the limits of the quasi-local conserved quantities. The

static slice t = 0 corresponds to the hypersurface y0 = 0. We have y4 = Ω,

ρ =

and

j = αH .

For the conserved quantities corresponding to ∂

to the hypersurface and the term in (7.2) that involves the quasi-local momentum density
j vanishes. As a result,

Total conserved quantities (or global charges) of asymptotically AdS initial data sets
have been studied extensively using the Hamiltonian of asymptotically Killing ﬁelds [1, 2,
10, 12, 11, 13, 14, 18, 28, 29]. We review the construction below and prove that they are the
same as the total conserved quantities in Deﬁnition 7.5 under the asymptotic assumptions
in Deﬁnition 7.2.

Let K be a Killing ﬁeld of the AdS spacetime. Let V and Y be the normal component
and the tangential component of K to the static slice of the AdS spacetime, respectively.
The Hamiltonian H(V, Y ) corresponding to K is

[Ui(V ) + Vi(Y )]ν idΣr

(7.16)

H(V, Y ) = lim
r→∞

where

Ui(V ) =V gjl∂jgil + DjV (gij − gH3

Proposition 7.6. For asymptotically AdS initial data sets with expansion given in Def-
inition 7.2, the total conserved quantities in Deﬁnition 7.5 agree with the total conserved
quantities (global charges) in (7.16).

Proof. In [19], Miao, Tam and Xie compute the limit of the Brown-York mass and prove
that

since h − |H| = O(r−6).
easy to see that

For C i and J i, we observe that ci and ji are tangent to the static slice t = 0 and it is

C i =H(V (ci), Y (ci))
J i =H(V (ji), Y (ji)).

We compare the conserved quantities for asymptotically AdS initial data sets to the
conserved quantities for asymptotically hyperbolic initial data sets we studied in [8]. (7.12)
and (7.13) resemble the total energy-momentum for the hyperbolic case (see Deﬁnition 1.4
of [8]). However, the second fundamental form k does not contribute to them in the AdS
case. The total angular momentum in (7.15) is the same as the total angular momentum

(cid:3)

26

PO-NING CHEN, MU-TAO WANG, AND SHING-TUNG YAU

for the hyperbolic case (see Theorem 7.3 of [8]). The total conserved quantity C i does not
seem to have a good analogy in the hyperbolic case; It is rather diﬀerent from the center
of mass in Theorem 7.3 of [8].

7.3. Limit of the quasi-local energy. In this subsection, we evaluate the limit of the
quasi-local energy at the inﬁnity of asymptotically AdS initial data sets and show that it
converges to the linear function dual to the total conserved quantities. First, we derive an
expression for the limit of quasi-local energy E(Σr, Xr, T0) for a family of surfaces Σr and
a family of isometric embeddings Xr of Σr into the reference spacetime. Then we apply the
result to the family of coordinate spheres at the inﬁnity of an asymptotically AdS initial
data set.

Theorem 7.7. Let Σr be a family of surfaces and Xr be a family of isometric embeddings
of Σr into the reference spacetime. Suppose the mean curvature vectors H of Σr and H0
of Xr(Σr) are both spacelike for r > R0 and

Then the limit of E(Σr, Xr, T0) is the same as the limit of

We are ready to show that for an asymptotically AdS initial data set, the large sphere
limit of the quasi-local energy is the linear function dual to the total conserved quantities
in Deﬁnition 7.5.

Theorem 7.8. Let (M, g, k) be an asymptotically AdS initial data set and Σr be the coor-

7.4. Evolution of the total conserved quantities under the Einstein equation. In
this subsection, we study the evolution of the total conserved quantities for asymptotically
AdS initial data sets under the Einstein equation.

We assume that the initial data set (M, g, k) satisﬁes the vacuum constraint equation

(with cosmological constant κ = −1)

R(g) + (trgk)2 − |k|2 = − 6

¯∇ikij − ∂j(trgk) =0
where ¯∇ is the covariant derivative with respect to g.
We shall ﬁx an asymptotically ﬂat coordinate system on M with respect to (gij(0), kij (0))
and consider a family (gij(t), kij (t)) that evolves according to the vacuum Einstein evolution
equation (with cosmological constant κ = −1)

(7.17)

∂tgij = −2N kij + (Lγg)ij

∂tkij = − ¯∇i ¯∇jN + N(cid:16)Rij + gij + (trk)kij − 2kilkl

j(cid:17) + (Lγk)ij

(7.18)

where N is the lapse function, γ is the shift vector, and L is the Lie derivative.
Theorem 7.9. Let (M, g, k) be an asymptotically AdS initial data set. Let (M, g(t), k(t))
be the solution to the vacuum Einstein equation with g(0) = g and k(0) = k, and with lapse
N = √r2 + 1 and a vanishing shift vector. Let E(t), P i(t), C i(t) and J i(t) be the total
conserved quantities for (M, g(t), k(t)) deﬁned in Deﬁnition 7.5. We have

∂tE(t) =0
∂tP i(t) = − C i(t)
∂tC i(t) =P i(t)
∂tJ i(t) =0.

Remark 7.10. The evolution equations for E and P i are proved previously in [3, Theorem
5.1] with a diﬀerent convention for C i.

Proof. Let h(t) be the mean curvature of Σr in the hypersurface (M, g(t)) and H(t) be the
mean curvature vector of Σr in the spacetime. We have |H(t)| = h(t) + O(r−4) and the
following formula for h(t) (see for example [27, 7]) :

h(t) =

∂r lnpdet(σab) − ∇agra
pgrr − σabgragrb

where gra is viewed as a 1-form on Σr and ∇ is the covariant derivative with respect to the
induced metric on Σr.

From the Einstein equation (7.18), we derive

∂tgab = −2pr2 + 1kab.

As a result,

∂t|H| =∂th(t) + O(r−4)

From the vacuum constraint equation, (7.17) we derive

On the other hand, the right hand side of (7.19) is

∂r(trgk) = r2∂rkrr + 2rkrr + σab∂rkab − 2rσabkab + O(r−6).

As a result, (7.19) implies

∇akar = −2rkrr + σab∂rkab − rσabkab + O(r−6)

and

This proves the evolution equations for E and P i.

∂th(t) = −r2∇akar + O(r−4).

To evaluate ∂tC i and ∂tJ i, we start with the evolution equation of the second funda-

mental form (7.18), which implies

∂tkar = rRicar + O(r−4).

The evolution of C i follows from taking the divergence of the above equation, multiplying
with r2xi, and integrating over Σr. For the evolution of J i, we take the curl of the above
equation instead.

From the above theorem, it follows that the rest mass of asymptotically initial data

deﬁned by the authors in [9] is invariant under the Einstein equation.

Corollary 7.11. Let (M, g, k) be an asymptotically AdS initial data set. Let (M, g(t), k(t))
be the solution to the vacuum Einstein equation with g(0) = g and k(0) = k, and with
lapse N = √r2 + 1 and a vanishing shift vector. Let m(t) be the rest mass of the data
(M, g(t), k(t)). Then we have

∂tm(t) = 0.

Proof. Let ~p = (P 1, P 2, P 3), ~c = (C 1, C 2, C 3) and ~j = (J 1, J 2, J 3). From Theorem 6.7 of
[9], the rest mass m in terms of the total conserved quantities is

where

m2 =

(α +pβ)

α = E2 + |~j|2 − |~p|2 − |~c|2
β = (E2 − |~j|2 − |~p|2 − |~c|2)2 − 4|~j × ~p|2 − 4|~p × ~c|2 − 4|~c × ~j|2 + 8E~c · (~p × ~j).

The corollary follows from Theorem 7.9 by a direct computation.
