How to assess case-ﬁnding in chronic

diseases: Comparison of diﬀerent indices.

Ralph Brinks∗

Institute for Biometry and Epidemiology

German Diabetes Center

D¨usseldorf, Germany

Recently, we have proposed a new illness-death model that comprises a
state of undiagnosed chronic disease preceding the diagnosed disease. Based
on this model, the question arises how case-ﬁnding can be assessed in the
presence of mortality from all these states. We simulate two scenarios of
diﬀerent performance of case-ﬁnding and apply several indices to assess case-
ﬁnding in both scenarios. One of the prevalence based indices leads to wrong
conclusions. Some indices are partly insensitive to distinguish the quality of
case-ﬁnding. The incidence based indices perform well. If possible, incidence
based indices should be preferred.

Keywords: Case-ﬁnding; Screening; Chronic diseases; Incidence; Prevalence; Mortal-

ity; Compartment model; Partial diﬀerential equation.

1 Introduction

Many chronic diseases have a preclinical phase, when the disease is principally detectable
but has not been diagnosed yet. Examples are cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, or dementia.

We call all collective activities and eﬀorts, in which cases of a speciﬁc chronic disease
not known to the health services are searched for, case-ﬁnding. Case-ﬁnding in this
sense is a very broad term, which comprises screening, application of diagnostic tests
and all other activities and policies of detecting cases of a chronic disease. Eﬀorts in
case-ﬁnding vary substantially, both globally and temporally. Geographical variations
are due to diﬀerent health systems, available resources and diﬀerences in the risk for
certain diseases in a region or country. For example, eﬀorts in case-ﬁnding for dementia

are likely to be higher in older populations, e.g., in the industrialised countries. Reasons
for temporal changes in case-ﬁnding of chronic diseases are manifold as well. Besides
technical progress in making diagnostic tests cheaper and more practicable, varying
awareness of patients and physicians may lead to an earlier or later diagnosis of the
disease.

Early detection of diseases might be important for two reasons. First, in many cases
it is favourable if the disease is treated early to make eﬀective treatment possible, e.g.
cancer [1], diabetes [2], or chronic kidney disease [3]. Second, patients with an undi-
agnosed disease already have an elevated risk for unfavourable outcomes. For example,
persons with undiagnosed diabetes have an about 50% increased risk of all-cause mortal-
ity compared to a healthy person [4, Table 2]. Another example is undiagnosed chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, which is rather frequent [5] and associated with a severe
loss of quality of life [6].

Given the enormous importance of case-ﬁnding in chronic diseases, we want to examine
diﬀerent measures of how to quantitatively assess the activities of case-ﬁnding of a speciﬁc
chronic disease. The question arises what epidemiological measures are suitable for
describing the performance of case-ﬁnding on the population level.

We give an example from the epidemiology of diabetes. Table 1 shows the prevalence
undiagnosed and diagnosed diabetes for men and women in two age groups of the KORA
study [7]. In men, we see that with increasing age the percentages of undiagnosed and
diagnosed diabetes increase. The situation is diﬀerent in women. As the age increases,
the prevalence of undiagnosed and diagnosed diabetes rises and lowers, respectively.
The key question of this article is: which situation is more desirable with respect to
case-ﬁnding, the situation of men or the one of women?

of the KORA study [7].

Before we try to answer this question, we describe the underlying epidemiological

model for assessing the performance of case-ﬁnding.

2 Epidemiological model

If we are interested in evaluating the eﬀorts of case-ﬁnding in a population, we consider
each person being exactly in one of the depicted states shown in Figure 1: Normal, i.e.,
healthy with respect to the considered chronic disease, Undiagnosed, Diagnosed or Dead.
At the birth each person is in the Normal state (here we just consider diseases acquired
after birth). During the life course, the person may contract the disease and enters the

2

Undiagnosed state.
In a screening program, or as the disease becomes symptomatic,
or during some routine medical examinations, the disease may be diagnosed and the
person enters the Diagnosed state. Persons may decease from any of these three states.
Note that we are just considering chronic diseases. Hence, backward steps from the
Undiagnosed state to the Normal state are not possible. Similarly, we assume that once
a person has got a diagnosis the disease remains detected for ever. Thus, we assume
that there is no loss of such information.

Figure 1: Chronic disease model. Persons in the state Normal are healthy with respect
to the disease under consideration. After onset of the disease, they change to
state Undiagnosed and later to the state Diagnosed. The absorbing state Dead
can be reached from all other states. The percentages of persons in the states
and the transition rates depend on calendar time t and age a.

In [8] we described relations between the transition rates λℓ(t, a), ℓ = 0, 1, and
µk(t, a), k = 0, 1, 2, in the model and the percentages of persons in the states. As
in [8] let pk(t, a) denote the fraction of persons aged a at time t in state k, k = 0, 1, 2.
For example, p1(t, a) is the fraction of persons in the population who are aged a at time
t and are in the Undiagnosed state (k = 1).

3 Assessment of case-ﬁnding

In this section, we describe measures for assessing the performance of case-ﬁnding. We
distinguish ﬁgures based on the prevalences and ﬁgures based on the transition rates
between the states in the epidemiological model (cf. Figure 1).

3

3.1 Figures based on the prevalence

The ﬁrst ﬁgure to approach case-ﬁnding, is the proportion of detected cases from the
total cases [9], i.e.,

℘1 = p2

p1+p2

.

(1)

Similar to the dark ﬁgure in criminology, the reciprocal of ℘1 describes the factor the
diagnosed cases have to be multiplied with to obtain the number of all cases of the
chronic disease. Obviously, it holds 0 ≤ ℘1 ≤ 1. A high value in ℘1 is usually interpreted
as advantageous [9].

Analogously, it may be useful to consider the ratio

℘2 = p1

p0+p1

.

(2)

This ratio relates the number of persons in the undiagnosed state to all persons who
do not have a diagnosis, i.e., the healthy and the undiagnosed. The idea behind the
measure ℘2 is that case-ﬁnding can be thought of distinguishing persons from a pool
consisting of healthy and undiagnosed persons. This pool of healthy and undiagnosed
persons may be seen as the search space. The search space is subject to the activities
of case-ﬁnding. Once an undiagnosed person is undoubtedly identiﬁed as a case, this
person gets a diagnosis and is removed from the search space henceforth. As the disease
under consideration is chronic, there is no way back into the search space. In contrast
to ℘1, the ﬁgure ℘2 just refers to the persons who are at risk for a possible diagnosis.
The fraction of persons with a diagnosis does not play a role.

Again, it holds 0 ≤ ℘2 ≤ 1. Ideally, ℘2 is 0, i.e., all undetected cases are removed from
the search space. The closer ℘2 approaches 1, the more the search space is dominated
by the undiagnosed persons. Thus, a lower value of ℘2 is advantageous in assessing
case-ﬁnding.

If we calculate the measures ℘1 and ℘2 for the data in Table 1, we obtain the values

shown in Table 2.

Table 2: Age- and sex-speciﬁc ratios ℘1 and ℘2 for the data in Table 1.

Age

(years) Men Women Men Women
60–64
65–69

9
10

8
9

47
60

50

For men, the measure ℘1 increases from 47% to 60% as the age increases. Thus, ℘1
indicates that with increasing age the performance of case-ﬁnding improves. However,
℘2 indicates that the performance of case-ﬁnding in men deteriorates from the lower
age class to the higher. Thus, the measures ℘1 and ℘2 yield contradicting ﬁndings in
assessing the performance of case-ﬁnding.

4

As the age increases, the measure ℘1 for women decreases from 57% to 50%, which
indicates a worsening of case-ﬁnding. Similarly, ℘2 shows a worsening. In women, the
ﬁgures ℘1 and ℘2 allow the same conclusion. This example from the KORA study shows
that at least one of the ﬁgures ℘1 or ℘2 is not suitable for assessing the performance of
case-ﬁnding. We will come back later to this point.

3.2 Figures based on the transition rates

Apart from the ﬁgures based on the prevalences, we may consider ﬁgures based on the
transitions in the model.

3.2.1 Incidence rate ratio

In [8] we used the rate ratio DR = λ1
, which relates the instantaneous risk (hazard) of
λ0
transiting to the diagnosed state to the risk of becoming an undetected case. As it is
unlikely to be diagnosed immediately after entering the undiagnosed state, we introduce
a delay parameter γ, γ ≥ 0, and deﬁne

DRγ(t, a) =

λ1(t + γ, a + γ)

λ0(t, a)

.

Obviously, it holds DR = DR0 .

3.2.2 Deaths without a diagnosis

An important ﬁgure is the fraction of healthy persons aged a at time t who become
incident undiagnosed cases at time t and die within γ > 0 time units without a diagnosis.
As these persons do not have a diagnosis, they never were treated. To develop this ﬁgure
we ﬁrst calculate the probability of dying P (dead)
during the ﬁrst γ > 0 time units in the
undiagnosed state:

γ

P (dead)

γ

(t, a) = Z γ

0

µ1(t + s, a + s) exp(cid:16)−Z s

0

(λ1 + µ1)(t + τ, a + τ )dτ(cid:17) ds.

(3)

Then, the probability P (dead)

γ

is combined with the incidence rate λ0 :

Φγ(t, a) = λ0(t, a) P (dead)

γ

(t, a).

(4)

Then, Φγ(t, a) is the number of death cases per one healthy person aged a at time t,
who becomes an incident undiagnosed case at t and dies within γ time units without
diagnosis. To get an integer number, one may multiply with a power of 10, say, 100,000.
These originally 100,000 healthy persons never had the chance of obtaining a treatment.

5

3.3 Other ﬁgures

In the ﬁeld of infectious disease epidemiology, sometimes the case detection rate (CDR)
is considered. The CDR is the notiﬁcation rate of incident cases over the total incidence
rate. Roughly speaking, it is the proportion of detected incident cases from the total
incident cases [10]. In our terminology, the CDR can be calculated as:

CDR = DR0 ℘2.

(5)

A proof for this relation can be found in the appendix.

4 Simulation study

In the introducing example from the KORA study, we have seen that the prevalence-
based measures ℘1 and ℘2 have come to contradicting conclusions about the performance
of case-ﬁnding in the male population. So far, it remains open which measure is more
appropriate for the assessment of case-ﬁnding.

In this section, we conduct a simulation study with two diﬀerent settings to answer
this question. In one setting, the underlying (true) performance of case-ﬁnding worsens
over time, whereas in the other setting the true performance betters. For both settings,
we calculate the introduced measures of assessing the case-ﬁnding by comparing two
points in time. For setting up the simulation, we use a system of partial diﬀerential
equations with known transition rates.

4.1 Partial diﬀerential equations

Based on the epidemiological model in Figure 1, we have shown that in a population with-
out migration and with suﬃciently smooth transition rates λℓ, ℓ = 0, 1, µk, k = 0, 1, 2,
the prevalences pk, k = 0, 1, 2, are governed by a set of partial diﬀerential equations [8]:

(∂t + ∂a)p1 = λ0 −(cid:0)λ0 + λ1 + µ1 − µ0(cid:1) p1 − λ0 p2 + λ0
(∂t + ∂a)p2 = λ1 p1 −(cid:0)µ2 − µ(cid:1) p2.

(6)

(7)

The notation ∂x means the partial derivative with respect to x, x ∈ {t, a}. In Equa-
tions (6) – (7), the term µ is the overall mortality (general mortality), which can be
written as

µ = p0 µ0 + p1 µ1 + p2 µ2.

(8)

The prevalence p0 can be calculated by using the equation p0 = 1 − p1 − p2. Thus,
together with the initial conditions p1(t, 0) = p2(t, 0) = 0 for all t, the system (6) – (7)
completely describes the dynamics of the disease in the considered population.

For later use, we remark that Equations (6) – (7) can be transformed into following

system:

(∂t + ∂a)p1 = λ0 (1 − p2) − (λ0 + λ1 + µ1 − µ0) p1 + p1 z
(∂t + ∂a)p2 = −(µ2 − µ0) p2 + λ1 p1 + p2 z,

(9)

(10)

6

where z = p1 (µ1 − µ0) + p2 (µ2 − µ0).

We will integrate the system (9) – (10) using the Method of Characteristics [11] and
Runge-Kutta integration [12]. All calculations are done with the software R (The R
Foundation of Statistical Computing).

4.1.1 Transition rates between the states

The incidence rate λ0 is chosen to be

λ0(t, a) =

1
3

× 10−4 × (a − 30)+ × 1.015t,

(11)

which in magnitude coarsely mimics the incidence of type 2 diabetes in males [13].

The rate λ1 is assumed to be a sigmoid function with a steep increase between the

20th and 50th year of age:

λ1(t, a, ε) =

0.02

1 + exp(cid:0)−0.25 × (a − 35)(cid:1)

×(cid:0)1.015 + ε(cid:1)t

.

(12)

This rate mimics an hypothetical awareness for type 2 diabetes, which is assumed to
increase after an onset at a = 20.

From Eq. (11), we observe that the rate λ0 rises with calendar time t. For the rate
λ1 we choose two simulation settings (A) and (B) with εA = −0.016 and εB = 0.01. In
settings A and B, the annual change (1.015+ε) of λ1 is negative and positive, respectively.
This will lead to an accumulation of undetected cases over calendar time in setting A
and a slowly decreasing reservoir of undetected cases in setting B.

Figure 2 shows the age courses of λ0 and λ1 for t = 0. Note that for t = 0 the rates

λ1 in setting A and B are the same:

λ1(0, a, εA) = λ1(0, a, εB ), for all a.

We choose Gompertz mortality rates, [14, Eq. (9.1)]:

µk(t, a) = exp(−ξk + ηk a) × (1 − ρk)t, k = 0, 1, 2,

(13)

with the coeﬃcients as in Table 3. The mortality rates of many populations approxi-
mately follow a Gompertz law, and the numbers roughly reﬂect the mortality of German
males in the past century. Calendar time t in this sense is the time (in years) after 1900.
For further references and a critical discussion of the Gompertz law of mortality see,
for instance, [15]. The yearly decrements ρk are chosen with a view to trends in mortality.
The choice ρ2 > ρ1 is motivated by the fact that medical progress is reaching treated
persons more than untreated.

4.1.2 Prevalence

Integrating Eq. (9) – (10) with the rates given in Eq. (11) – (12) and the Gompertz
mortalities (Eq. (13) and Table 3), we obtain p1 and p2 for the years t = 100 and t = 110
in both simulations as shown in Table 4.

The age courses of the prevalence of the undiagnosed (p1) and the diagnosed disease
(p2) in the years t1 = 100 and t2 = 110 are depicted in Figures 3 and 4 for both simulation

In both simulation settings, A and B, we see that the prevalence of the diagnosed
chronic disease is increasing from year 100 to 110 in nearly all age classes. The preva-
lence of the undiagnosed disease is also growing for virtually all ages in simulation A.
However in setting B, the prevalence of the undiagnosed is remaining constant or slightly
decreasing – despite λ0 increases over time for each age group. As expected, we observe
an accumulation of undetected cases in setting A and a slowly decreasing reservoir of
undetected cases in setting B during the period from year 100 to year 110. By compar-
ing the prevalences of the undiagnosed and diagnosed disease in settings A and B, we
can conclude that the performance of case-ﬁnding worsens in setting A and improves in
setting B.

4.2 Assessing the case-ﬁnding

4.2.1 Prevalence based ﬁgures

If we calculate the ratios ℘1 and ℘2 for some ages in years 100 and 110 in both simulation
settings, we obtain the results as presented in Table 5. Graphical presentations are given
in Figures 5 and 6.

In simulation setting A, we see from Table 5 and Figure 5 that for all ages the ratio ℘1
remains the same or rises between t = 100 and t = 110. For example, in the age group
of 75 year-old persons, the ratio ℘1 is 21% for both years. Thus, based on ℘1 one would
judge that the situation of case-ﬁnding remains the same and slightly improves for the

higher age groups during the period 100 – 110. However if we consider ℘2 in setting A, we
get the indication that the situation worsens. For all age groups, ℘2 increases during 100
to 110, which indicates that during that period the percentage of undiagnosed persons in
the search space increases. Hence, the measures ℘1 and ℘2 yield contradicting ﬁndings
about the performance of case-ﬁnding in the years t = 100 and t = 110 in simulation
setting A.

In simulation setting B, Table 5 and Figure 6 show that ℘1 indicates an improvement
during the period from year 100 to year 110. ℘2 also reveals an improvement for the
ages 40 to 95.

To sum up, we can say that the ﬁgure ℘2 assesses both settings A and B correctly,

whereas ℘1 does not value setting A as being negative with respect to case-ﬁnding..

Figures 7 and 8 show the age-speciﬁc detection rates DR0 and DR5 . Although diﬀerent
in magnitude, both measures DR0 and DR5 indicate correctly that the case-ﬁnding
performance worsens from 100 to 110 in setting A and improves in setting B.

In Figure 9 we see the age courses of the CDR in the diﬀerent simulation settings
A (left) and B (right). We see that in setting A the CDR fails to indicate a lower
performing case-ﬁnding for a wide range of ages. In setting B, the CDR correctly values
the situation as an improvement of case-ﬁnding.

The results of assessing case-ﬁnding in the simulation settings A and B by the ﬁgure Φ5
are shown in Table 6. Let us consider, for example, the age group 90. In year t = 100, out
of 100,000 healthy persons 886 persons contract the undiagnosed disease. Ten years later,
this number increases to 1029. Both numbers just depend on λ0. Thus, they are valid for
both simulation settings. Out of these 886 and 1029 incident undiagnosed cases in years
100 and 110, within ﬁve years after onset of the disease 420 and 437, respectively, die
without a diagnosis in setting A. Thus, we have an increase of persons who never had the
chance for a treatment, which clearly indicates a worsening of case-ﬁnding performance.
In setting B, the number of these fatalities is considerably lower. In the years 100 and
110, we observe 259 and 235 death cases without diagnoses, respectively, a considerably
lower number. Hence, the measure Φ5 indicates that the situation worsens in setting A
and improves in setting B.

Table 7 sums up the ﬁndings of assessing the performance of case-ﬁnding in the dif-
ferent simulations settings. The measures ℘1 and CDR at least partly fail to indicate
the deterioration of case-ﬁnding in setting A, whereas the ﬁgures ℘2, DR0, DR5 and Φ5
assess both settings correctly.

Table 7: Summary of the diﬀerent measures of assessing case-ﬁnding. A plus (+) or
a minus (–) sign denotes whether the measure indicates an improvement or a
deterioration of case-ﬁnding over time.

5 Discussion

Based on a system of partial diﬀerential equations we set up a simulation study with an
temporally increasing (setting A) and decreasing (setting B) quality of case-ﬁnding in an
hypothetical chronic disease. Then, we applied diﬀerent ﬁgures to assess and compare
the performance of case-ﬁnding at two points in time. Some of the measures were not
able to judge the diﬀerences in both simulation settings correctly. Table 7 shows how
the diﬀerent settings have been assessed by the diﬀerent ﬁgures.

We found that the measures ℘1 and CDR are unsuitable measures to assess the case-
ﬁnding performance in chronic diseases, because the unfavourable situation of an tem-
porally increasing reservoir of undiagnosed cases (setting A) has not valued as being
negative.

The ﬁgure ℘2 correctly values settings A and B. Thus, it is sensitive measure for
the improvement and degradation of case-ﬁnding. Similarly, the detection ratios DRγ
correctly assess the diﬀerent simulation settings for γ = 0 and γ = 5. The ﬁgure Φ5 is an
important measure, which refers to a cohort of healthy persons who contract the disease
but never get the chance of being treated.

There are other ﬁgures to assess case-ﬁnding. For example, the mean sojourn time
(MST) in the preclinical phase may be considered, see [16] for a review. Usually, a low
MST is considered advantageous. However, the MST may be low if the mortality from
the undiagnosed state is high. Thus, the MST is not an appropriate ﬁgure for evaluating
case-ﬁnding.

Compared to the other ﬁgures, the measure ℘2 = p1

has the advantage that it just
require prevalence data, which can be obtained from cross-sectional studies. Those mea-
sures including the incidence rates either require costly follow-up data or the application
of specialized estimation techniques [8].

p0+p1

In this work, we applied these measures to data about undiagnosed and diagnosed
prevalence of diabetes from the KORA study. The ratio ℘2 unveils that in men and
women, the performance of case-ﬁnding is better in the age group 60–64 compared to
the the age group 65–69. The reasons for this may be individual or societal, but a
detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this article.

Appendix

The CDR is the proportion of incident cases being diagnosed [10], i.e., the notiﬁcation
rate of incident cases over the total incidence rate. Let λ′ be the notiﬁcation rate, which
is the number of detected cases transiting from the search space to the Diagnosed state
per unit time. Thus, the denominator is the number of persons in the combined state of
Normal and Undiagnosed. In the model in Figure 1 the rate λ1 refers to transitions from
the Undiagnosed state to the Diagnosed state. Here, the denominator is the number of

16

persons in the Undiagnosed state. Hence it holds λ′ = p1
incidence, it holds

p0+p1

λ1. As λ0 is the overall

CDR =

p1 λ1

(p0 + p1)λ0

= ℘2 DR0 .
