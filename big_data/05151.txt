A CALCULUS FOR THE MODULI SPACE OF CURVES

R. PANDHARIPANDE

0. Introduction

The moduli space Mg of complete nonsingular curves of genus g

admits a compactiﬁcation

Mg ⊂ Mg

by stable curves. Mumford, in Towards an enumerative geometry of
the moduli space of curves (published in 1983), writes:

The goal of this paper is to formulate and to begin an
exploration of the enumerative geometry of the set of all
curves of arbitrary genus g. By this we mean setting up
a Chow ring for the moduli space Mg and its compactiﬁ-
cation Mg, deﬁning what seem to be the most important
classes in this ring and calculating the class of some geo-
metrically important loci in Mg in terms of these classes.
We take as a model for this the enumerative geometry of
the Grassmannians. [65]

Mumford’s most important classes are now termed tautological classes.
He opened the door to the study of their algebra — a fascinating topic
connected to many areas of modern mathematics.

More than three decades have passed since Mumford’s article. The
progress in our understanding of the intersection theory of the moduli
space of curves has been considerable. Calculations by classical meth-
ods of the algebra of tautological classes on Mg for low g by Faber [18],
starting in the 80’s and continuing later in the 90’s with Zagier, have
proved to be fundamental. Witten’s conjecture [88] in the 90’s relat-
ing the integration of the cotangent line classes on the moduli spaces
Mg,n of stable pointed curves to the KdV hierarchy was a marvelous

surprise: the study of the algebra of tautological classes was linked at
a basic level to the theory of integrable hierarchies. The deep role of
topology was highlighted in 2007 by the landmark proof of Madsen and
Weiss [59] via homotopy theory of Mumford’s conjecture on the stable
cohomology of Mg as g → ∞.
Starting in the mid 90’s, there was a swift development of Gromov-
Witten theory. The moduli space Mg,n(X) of stable maps intertwines
the geometry of Mg,n with the geometry of the nonsingular target va-
riety X. Gromov-Witten theory is based upon the virtual fundamental
class [2, 3] of the moduli of stable maps,

(cid:104)Mg,n(X)

(cid:105)vir ∈ A∗(Mg,n(X)) ,

a new algebraic cycle1 whose properties constrain the algebra of tauto-
logical classes of Mg,n in remarkable ways.

A systematic study of the constraints imposed by Gromov-Witten
theory on the algebra of tautological classes was started2 2009 in [69]
and continued in [70, 71]. Recent progress has culminated in a complete
proposal by Pixton [79] for a calculus of tautological classes on Mg,n.
My goal here is to present Pixton’s proposal and survey the rapid
advances of the past 6 years. Several open questions are discussed. An
eﬀort has been made to condense a great deal of mathematics into as
few pages as possible with the hope that the reader will follow through
to the end.

Acknowledgments. The spirit of my lecture at the 2015 AMS sum-
mer institute in algebraic geometry in Salt Lake City has been followed
rather closely here. I would like to thank the Clay Mathematics Insti-
tute for supporting my visit. Some of the material in Sections 1-3 is
based on unpublished notes [68] of a lecture I gave at A celebration of
algebraic geometry at Harvard in 2011. Sections 4 and 5 are directly
connected to the lecture in Salt Lake City. A discussion of the recent

by the years in which the proofs were found. Published versions appear later and
in mixed order. The dates of publication can be found in the bibliography.

Much of what I know about the moduli space of curves has been
learned through collaborations. Directly relevant to the material pre-
sented here is work with P. Belorousski, C. Faber, G. Farkas, E. Get-
zler, T. Graber, F. Janda, X. Liu, A. Marian, A. Okounkov, D. Oprea,
A. Pixton, and D. Zvonkine. Discussions in Z¨urich with A. Buryak,
R. Cavalieri, E. Clader, D. Petersen, O. Randal-Williams, Y. Ruan,
I. Setayesh, and Q. Yin have played an important role. I have been
very fortunate to have had the opportunity to interact with all of these
mathematicians.

1. Tautological classes on Mg

1.1. κ classes. Let Mg be the moduli space of complete nonsingular
genus g ≥ 2 curves over C, and let
(1)
be the universal curve. We view Mg and Cg as nonsingular, quasi-
projective, Deligne-Mumford stacks. However, the orbifold perspective
is suﬃcient for most of our purposes.

π : Cg → Mg

The cotangent line L to the ﬁbers of the morphism (1) deﬁnes a

cotangent line class,

ψ = c1(L) ∈ A1(Cg) .

The κ classes are deﬁned by push-forward,

κr = π∗(ψr+1) ∈ Ar(Mg) .

The tautological ring

R∗(Mg) ⊂ A∗(Mg)

is the Q-subalgebra generated by all of the κ classes.3 There is a canon-
ical quotient

Q[κ1, κ2, κ3, . . .]

q−→ R∗(Mg) −→ 0 .

3Since κ0 = 2g − 2 ∈ Q is a multiple of the fundamental class, we need not take

κ0 as a generator.

4

R. PANDHARIPANDE

The kernel of q is the ideal of relations among the κ classes.

1.2. Motivations. There are two basic motivations for the study of
the tautological rings R∗(Mg). The ﬁrst is Mumford’s conjecture
proven by Madsen and Weiss [59],

g→∞ H∗(Mg) = Q[κ1, κ2, κ3, . . .] ,

lim

determining the stable cohomology of the moduli of curves. While the
κ classes do not exhaust H∗(Mg), there are no other stable classes.
The second motivation comes from a large body of classical calcula-
tions on Mg (often related to Brill-Noether theory). The answers in-
variably lie in the tautological ring R∗(Mg). The study of tautological
classes by Mumford [65] was directly inspired by such algebro-geometric
cycle constructions.

1.3. Schubert calculus. The structure of the Chow ring of the Grass-
mannian Gr(r, n) of r-dimensional subspaces of Cn is well-known [26]
and may be viewed as a model for the study of the tautological classes
on Mg.

The Chern classes of the universal subbundle

S → Gr(r, n)

generate the entire Chow ring,

Q(cid:2)c1(S), . . . , cr(S)(cid:3)
ker(q) =(cid:0)sn−r+1(S), . . . , sn(S)(cid:1) ,

The kernel of q is expressed in term of the Segre classes of the universal
subbundle as

q−→ A∗(Gr(r, n)) −→ 0 .

1

c(S)

= s(S) .

The Schubert calculus for the Grassmannian yields classical formulas
for geometric loci in terms of the generators ci(S). The subject is
fundamentally connected to the representation theory of the symmetric
group.

A basic goal (expressed in the quotation of Mumford in the Intro-
duction) is to develop a calculus for tautological classes on the moduli
space of curves parallel to the Schubert calculus for the Grassmannian.

1.4. Cohomology. We may also deﬁne a tautological ring

RH∗(Mg) ⊂ H∗(Mg)

generated by the κ classes in cohomology. Since there is a natural
factoring

Q[κ1, κ2, κ3, . . .]

q−→ R∗(Mg)

c−→ RH∗(Mg)

via the cycle class map c, algebraic relations among the κ classes are
also cohomological relations. Whether or not there exist more coho-
mological relations is not yet settled.
Q1. Is the cycle class map R∗(Mg)

c−→ RH∗(Mg) an isomorphism?

Calculations (discussed in Section 2.3 below) show the answer to ques-
tion Q1 is aﬃrmative at least for g < 24.

2. Faber-Zagier relations on Mg

2.1. Conjecture and proof. Guided by low genus calculations and
deep insight, Faber and Zagier conjectured in 2000 a remarkable set of
relations among the κ classes in R∗(Mg) for all g.

The ﬁrst proof [70, 71] of the Faber-Zagier conjecture (Theorem 1 of
Section 2.2) was given in 2010 via a geometric construction involving
the virtual class of the moduli space of stable quotients [60].4 Since
then, a proof [72] in RH∗(Mg) via Witten’s 3-spin class was found in
2013, and a second proof [40, 42] in R∗(Mg) via the virtual class of the
moduli space of stable maps to P1 was found in 2014.

2.2. Formulas. To write the Faber-Zagier relations, we will require
the following notation. Let the variable set

p = { p1, p3, p4, p6, p7, p9, p10, . . . }

4The ﬁrst relations obtained by virtual localization [32] on the moduli space
of stable quotients can be found in [60, Section 8]. See also [89] for a study of
properties of the relations of [60, Section 8].

(cid:2) exp(−γFZ)(cid:3)

tdpσ = 0

holds when d > g−1+|σ|

3

and g ≡ d + |σ| + 1 mod 2.

The dependence upon the genus g in the Faber-Zagier relations of
Theorem 1 occurs in the inequality, the modulo 2 restriction, and via
κ0 = 2g−2. For a given genus g and codimension r, Theorem 1 provides
only ﬁnitely many relations. While not immediately clear from the
deﬁnition, the Q-linear span of the Faber-Zagier relations determines
an ideal in Q[κ1, κ2, κ3, . . .], see [71, Section 6].

5All parts of a partition are positive (a condition satisﬁed by the empty

partition).

2.3. Gorenstein property. The ring R∗(Mg) is generated over Q by
the classes

κ1, κ2, . . . , κ(cid:98) g

3(cid:99) ∈ R∗(Mg) ,

as conjectured by Faber [18] and proven by Morita [64] in RH∗(Mg)
and Ionel [38] in R∗(Mg). By Boldsen’s results [7], there are no

(2)
The proportionalities in Rg−2(Mg) of monomials in the κ classes are
known via Hodge integral evaluations [18, 19, 31]. The generation, non-
vanishing, vanishing, and proportionality results were all conjectured
by Faber in 90s and proven by 2005.

For g < 24, the Faber-Zagier relations yield6 a Gorenstein ring,

with continually improving methods. The discovery of the failure of R∗
be Gorenstein came in 2009 during a visit to Lisbon.

8

R. PANDHARIPANDE

Calculations show the Gorenstein property continues to fail (to an in-
creasingly greater extent) as g increases above 24.

Q2. Do the Faber-Zagier relations span the ideal of relations among
the κ classes in R∗(Mg) for all g?

While question Q2 is completely open, a negative answer would be
surprising since many diﬀerent mathematical approaches have failed
to ﬁnd relations outside of the Faber-Zagier span [18, 40, 70, 72, 82,
87]. Moreover, the Gorenstein property for the algebra of tautological
classes has been proven to fail for the moduli space Mct
2,8 of curves of
compact type and the moduli space M2,20 of stable curves in [74, 78].
So there appears to be no compelling reason to believe the Gorenstein
property holds for M24.

2.4. Hypergeometric series. The main actors in the Faber-Zagier
relations are the series

In the proofs of the Faber-Zagier relations, geometric sources for the
series A and B were found. The two approaches [40, 71] in R∗(Mg)
both ﬁnd the series in the Frobenius geometry associated to P1.
In
the proof of [72] in RH∗(Mg), the functions A and B appear in the
R-matrix of the Frobenius manifold associated to 3-spin curves.

2.5. Descendents. The series A appears in the asymptotic expansion
of the Airy function related to the Witten-Kontsevich theory of descen-
dent integration over the moduli space of stable curves.

Let Mg,n be the moduli space of stable genus g curves with n marked

points. The cotangent line at the ith marking deﬁnes a line bundle

Li → Mg,n

with ﬁrst Chern class

ψi = c1(Li) ∈ A1(Mg,n) .

Q3. Is the descendent evaluation (5) related to the occurrence of the A
series in the relations among tautological classes?

Question Q3 was ﬁrst raised in [8] where the many appearances of
the A and B series related to the moduli spaces of curves are surveyed.

2.6. Markings. The algebra of tautological classes may also be stud-
ied on the moduli spaces

Mg,n , Mrt

g,n , Cn

g

of pointed curves lying over Mg. Here, Mg,n is the moduli space of
nonsingular curves with distinct markings, Mrt
g,n is the moduli of curves
with rational tails, and Cn
g is the nth ﬁber product of the universal curve

π : Cg → Mg .

In addition to the κ classes, there are cotangent line classes ψi at the
markings and diagonal classes. The full algebra of tautological classes
will be considered in Section 4.8.

3. κ classes on Mct

g,n

3.1. Compact type. A connected nodal curve C is of compact type
if the dual graph of C is a tree (or, equivalently, if the Jacobian of C

A CALCULUS FOR THE MODULI SPACE OF CURVES

11

is compact). The moduli space Mct
between the moduli spaces of nonsingular and stable curves

g,n of curves of compact type lies in

Mg,n ⊂ Mct
The algebra of κ classes on Mct

g,n ⊂ Mg,n .
g,n is remarkably well-behaved. The
structure is simpler and better understood than for Mg. Of course,
the full algebra of tautological classes on Mct
g,n contains more than the
κ classes (and will be discussed in Section 4.8).
3.2. κ classes. The deﬁnition of the κ classes on Mg is easily extended
to the moduli of stable curves. Let

π : Mg,n+1 → Mg,n

be the universal curve viewed as the (n + 1)-pointed space, and let

ψn+1 = c1(Ln+1) ∈ A1(Mg,n+1)

be the Chern class of the cotangent line at the last marking. The κ
classes are

κr = π∗(ψr+1

n+1) ∈ Ar(Mg,n),

i ≥ 0 .

The simplest is κ0 which equals 2g − 2 + n times the unit in A0(Mg,n).

The restriction of κr ∈ Ar(Mg) to Mg via the inclusion

Mg ⊂ Mg

agrees with the deﬁnition of κr ∈ Ar(Mg) of Section 1.1. The κ classes
on Mct

g,n are deﬁned via restriction from Mg,n.
Deﬁne the κ ring for curves of compact type,

κ∗(Mct

g,n) ⊂ A∗(Mct

g,n) ,

to be the Q-subalgebra generated by the κ classes. Of course, the κ
rings are graded by degree.
3.3. Basic results. The ring κ∗(Mct
classes

g,n) is generated over Q by the
2 (cid:99) ∈ κ∗(Mct

κ1, κ2, . . . , κg−1+(cid:98) n

If n > 0, there are no relations of degree less than or equal to g − 1 + (cid:98) n
2(cid:99).
In κ∗(Mct
g ), there are no relations of degree less than g − 1 (whether
degree g− 1 relations can occur is not known). The proofs of the above
generation and freeness results can be found in [69].

g,n) .

12

R. PANDHARIPANDE

The nonvanishing and vanishing results for κ∗(Mct

g,n),

κ2g−3+n(Mct

g,n) ∼= Q,

κ>2g−3+n(Mct

g,n) = 0 ,

parallel to (2) for the κ classes on Mg, were proven in [21, 34]. The
proportionalities in κ2g−3+n(Mct
g,n) of the monomials in the κ classes
are determined by Hodge integral evaluations [19, 20, 31].

3.4. Universality. A new and surprising feature about the κ rings in
the compact type case is the following universality result proven in [69].
There appears to be no parallel for Mg.

Theorem 2 (P. 2009). Let g > 0 and n > 0, then the assignment
κi (cid:55)→ κi extends to a ring isomorphism

ι : κ∗(Mct

g−1,n+2) ∼= κ∗(Mct

g,n) .

In other words, the relations among the κ classes in the above cases
are genus independent! By composing the isomorphisms ι of Theorem
2, we obtain isomorphisms

ι : κ∗(Mct

0,2g+n) ∼= κ∗(Mct
g,n)

so long as n > 0. Hence, universality reduces all questions about the
κ rings to genus 0. Calculations of the relations, bases, and Betti
numbers of the ring κ∗(Mct
g,n>0) are obtained in [69] using the genus 0
reduction.

Let P (d) be the set of partitions of d, and let

P (d, k) ⊂ P (d)

be the set of partitions of d into at most k parts. Let |P (d, k)| be
the cardinality. To a partition with positive parts p = (p1, . . . , p(cid:96)) in
P (d, k), we associate a κ monomial by

κp = κp1 ··· κp(cid:96) ∈ κd(Mct

g,n) .

Theorem 3 (P. 2009). For n > 0, a Q-basis of κd(Mct

g,n) is given by

{κp | p ∈ P (d, 2g − 2 + n − d) } .

The Betti number calculation,

dimQ κd(Mct
is implied by Theorem 3.

g,n) = |P (d, 2g − 2 + n − d)| ,

A CALCULUS FOR THE MODULI SPACE OF CURVES

13

Q4. Is there a representation theoretic formula for the multiplication
of κ∗(Mct

g,n) in the basis of Theorem 3?

Question Q4 appears directly parallel to questions in the Schubert
calculus. Recent progress on Q4 has been made by Setayesh [83] who
has found a formula involving the combinatorics of partitions.

Theorems 2 and 3 for the κ rings in the compact type case require
at least 1 marked point. In the unmarked case, half of the universality
still holds. The assignment κi (cid:55)→ κi extends to a surjection

ιg : κ∗(Mct

0,2g) → κ∗(Mct

g ) .

However, a nontrivial kernel is possible. The ﬁrst kernel occurs in genus
g = 5.
Q5. What is the kernel of κ∗(Mct

0,2g) → κ∗(Mct
g )?

In genus 5, the kernel of ι5 is related to Getzler’s relation in M1,4,
see [69] for a discussion. A complete answer to Q5 will likely involve
sequences of special relations in the tautological ring.7

The proofs of Theorems 2 and 3 were obtained in [69] by studying the
virtual class of the moduli space of stable quotients [60]. The results
were precursors to the proof [70, 71] of the Faber-Zagier relations via
the moduli of stable quotients.

3.5. Relations. A natural question to ask is whether κ relations in
the compact type case can be put in a form parallel to Theorem 1. An
answer has been found by Pixton [80, Section 3.4].

We deﬁne a set of relations as follows. Let
p = { p1, p2, p3, . . . }

be a variable set indexed by all positive integers. Let

∞(cid:88)

curious to know the answer.

Theorems 2 and 3 determine the complete set of relations among
the κ classes in the n > 0 case. Using Theorems 2 and 3, Pixton [80]
has proven that the Q-linear span of the relations of Theorem 4 is the
complete set in the n > 0 case.

4. Pixton’s relations on Mg,n

4.1. Overview. Tautological classes on the moduli space Mg,n of sta-
ble curves are obtained from κ classes, ψ classes, and the classes of
boundary strata (indexed by stable graphs).8 Decorated stable graphs
provide a language for describing all tautological classes. A parallel
role is played by the language of partitions in the Schubert calculus of
the Grassmannian. After a brief discussion of stable graphs in Section
4.2, the algebra of tautological classes

R∗(Mg,n) ⊂ A∗(Mg,n)

is deﬁned in Section 4.3.

The main recent advance is the set of relations in R∗(Mg,n) found by
Pixton. Pixton’s relations [79] were conjectured in 2012 and ﬁrst proven
[72] to hold in RH∗(Mg,n) in 2013 using Witten’s 3-spin class9 and the
Givental-Teleman classiﬁcation of Cohomological Field Theories [86].
Shortly afterwards (also in 2013), Janda [39] found a proof in R∗(Mg,n)
8A study of the algebra of κ classes can also be pursued on Mg,n, see [15, 16].
9Tautological relations obtained from Witten’s r-spin class for higher r are stud-
ied in [73]. By Janda’s result [41], the relations of [73] are contained in Pixton’s
set.

using a mix of virtual localization [32] and R-matrix techniques for
the equivariant stable quotients theory of P1. His argument combined
elements of the Chow results of [70, 71] and the CohFT methods of [72].
A second proof in Chow via the equivariant Gromov-Witten theory of
P1 was found by Janda [42] in 2015.

Pixton has further conjectured that all relations among tautological
classes are obtained from his set. The claim is open and is perhaps
the most important question in the subject. Pixton’s relations for
R∗(Mg,n) specialize to the Faber-Zagier relations when restricted to
the moduli space Mg of nonsingular curves.

4.2. Boundary strata. The boundary strata of the moduli space
Mg,n parameterizing complex structures on curves of ﬁxed topologi-
cal type correspond to stable graphs. The idea here is simple, but the
notation requires some care.

A stable graph Γ consists of the data

Γ = (V, H, L, g : V → Z≥0, v : H → V, ι : H → H)

which satisﬁes the following properties:

(i) V is a vertex set with a genus function g : V → Z≥0,
(ii) H is a half-edge set equipped with a vertex assignment

v : H → V

and an involution ι : H → H,

(iii) E, the edge set, is deﬁned by the 2-cycles of ι in H (self-edges

at vertices are permitted),

(iv) L, the set of legs, is deﬁned by the ﬁxed points of ι and is en-
dowed with a bijective correspondence with the set of markings

L ↔ {1, . . . , n} ,

(v) the pair (V, E) deﬁnes a connected graph,
(vi) for each vertex v, the stability condition holds:

2g(v) − 2 + n(v) > 0,

where n(v) is the valence of Γ at v including both edges and
legs.

16

R. PANDHARIPANDE

An automorphism of Γ consists of automorphisms of the sets V and H
which leave invariant the structures g, ι, and v (and hence respect E
and L). Let Aut(Γ) denote the automorphism group of Γ.

The genus of a stable graph Γ is deﬁned by

g(Γ) =

g(v) + h1(Γ).

(cid:88)

v∈V

(cid:89)

v∈V

A boundary stratum of the moduli space Mg,n naturally determines a
stable graph of genus g with n legs by considering the dual graph of a
generic pointed curve parameterized by the stratum.

To each stable graph Γ, we associate the moduli space

MΓ =

Mg(v),n(v).

Let πv denote the projection from MΓ to Mg(v),n(v) associated to the
vertex v. There is a canonical morphism

(6)

ξΓ : MΓ → Mg,n

with image10 equal to the closure of the boundary stratum associated
to the graph Γ. To construct ξΓ, a family of stable pointed curves
over MΓ is required. Such a family is easily deﬁned by attaching the
pull-backs of the universal families over each of the Mg(v),n(v) along the
sections corresponding to half-edges. Let

[Γ] ∈ A∗(Mg,n)

denote the push-forward under ξΓ of the fundamental class of MΓ.

Two examples of boundary strata in M3,3 and their associated stable

graphs are given in the following diagram.

10 The degree of ξΓ is |Aut(Γ)|.

A CALCULUS FOR THE MODULI SPACE OF CURVES

17

Let Φ and (cid:98)Φ be the stable graphs in the ﬁrst and second cases in the

diagram. The moduli space MΦ in the ﬁrst case is

M0,4 × M2,3

with |Aut(Φ)| = 2. The nontrivial automorphism arises from switching
the edges. The moduli space M(cid:98)Φ in the second case is
with |Aut((cid:98)Φ)| = 2. The nontrivial automorphism arises from switching

M1,2 × M0,3 × M1,4

the half-edges on the self-edge.
4.3. Strata algebra. Let S∗
g,n be the Q-algebra of κ and ψ classes
supported on the strata of Mg,n. A Q-basis of S∗
g,n is given by isomor-
phism classes of pairs [Γ, γ] where Γ is a stable graph corresponding to
a stratum of the moduli space,

MΓ → Mg,n ,

and γ is a product of κ and ψ classes on MΓ. The κ classes are
associated to the vertices, and the ψ classes are associated to the half-
edges. The only condition imposed is that the degrees of the κ and
ψ classes associated to a vertex v ∈ V(Γ) together do not exceed the
dimension 3g(v) − 3 + n(v) of the moduli space at v.

For the graph Φ associated to a stratum of M3,3 in the diagram, let
v0 and v2 denote the vertices of genus 0 and 2 respectively. Let the left
edge consist of the two half edges h0 − h2 where h0 is incident to v0

18

(7)

and h2 is incident to v2. Then,

g,n is graded by codimension

The image of (8) is, by deﬁnition, the tautological ring11

Hence, we have a quotient

q−→ R∗(Mg,n) −→ 0 .

The ideal of tautological relations is the kernel of q.

In the strata algebra, the basis elements [Γ, γ] are treated formally.

In the case (g, n) = (0, 4), we have

0,4 = 1 ,

0,4 = 8 .

Let Γ• be the unique graph of genus 0 with 4 markings and a single
vertex v. Then

pairs

The ﬁrst geometrically interesting relation12 was found in genus 1
by Getzler [28] in 1996. Soon after, several low genus relations were
determined. Below is a tautological relation13 in codimension 2 on M2,3
found in [6] in 1998.

Pixton’s set puts order to the chaos of strata classes and coeﬃcients
which appear in the above relation (and in all the other relations14
found in the period after Getzler’s discovery).

13The strata classes in the genus 2 relation of the diagram have been represented
by their topological type instead of their associated dual graph. The genera of the
components are underlined. The red marked points are unlabeled. Each picture
represents the sum of the 6 possible labelings of the markings. The diagram (taken
from [6]) was typeset by P. Belorousski.

Deﬁnitions of Gg,n and ζv. Let Gg,n be the (ﬁnite) set of stable

the conditions

ζvζv(cid:48) = ζv(cid:48)ζv ,

to the edge e and ψ(cid:48), ψ(cid:48)(cid:48) are the ψ-classes corresponding to the
half-edges.

The numerator of ∆e is divisible by the denominator due to the iden-
tity15

further operations.18
Q6. Do Pixton’s relations P span the ideal of relations among the
tautological classes in R∗(Mg,n) for all g and n?

4.7. Pixton’s conjecture. Pixton has conjectured an aﬃrmative an-
swer to question Q6. The evidence for Pixton’s conjecture is (at least)
the following:

(i) All the previously found relations occur in P. The theory in
genus 0 is straightforward (and explained in [72, Section 3.6]).
Modulo simpler relations, Getzler’s genus 1 relation is

R2
1,(1,1,1,1) ∈ S 2
1,4 .

Pixton’s conjecture is true19 for g ∈ {0, 1} and all n. The genus
2 relation displayed in Section 4.3 is

R2
2,(1,1,1) ∈ S 2

2,3

modulo simpler relations.

(ii) Computer calculations of Pixton’s relations for low (g, n) often
yield Gorenstein rings (forbidding further relations). However,
just as in the Faber-Zagier case, Pixton’s relations do not always
yield Gorenstein rings.

(iii) Janda [41] has proven that a wide class of semisimple Cohomo-
logical Field Theories (including higher projective spaces and
r-spin curves) will not yield relations outside of P.

Question Q6 has not been investigated as extensively as question Q2
for the Faber-Zagier relations since the moduli spaces of stable curves
are computationally more diﬃcult to handle. However, the failure to
18From Pixton’s results, the most eﬃcient deﬁnition of the Q-linear span of P is

as the smallest set of ideals

{Ig,n ⊂ S∗

g,n }

which contains P and is closed under the natural boundary and forgetful operations.
19The proof uses the Gorenstein property of the tautological rings R∗(M0,n) and
R∗(M1,n). The Gorenstein property is clear in g = 0 since

R∗(M0,n) ∼= H∗(M0,n)

and is proven in g = 1 in [75].

A CALCULUS FOR THE MODULI SPACE OF CURVES

25

ﬁnd additional κ relations in R∗(Mg) may also be viewed as supporting
Q6 by the restriction property.

Pixton’s proposal provides an eﬀective calculus of tautological classes
on the moduli spaces Mg,n of stable curves. With an aﬃrmative an-
swer to Q6, Pixton’s calculus provides a complete answer. Perhaps
a reformulation of the set P in a more directly algebraic setting will
eventually be found. How the subject will develop depends very much
on the answer to Q6.

Even a few years ago, a calculus for the moduli space of curves
seemed far out of reach. Pixton’s proposal has led to a striking change
of outlook.

4.8. Nonsingular and compact type curves. The moduli spaces

are all open subsets. The algebras of tautological classes20

are deﬁned in each case as the image of the respective restriction of

4.9. Further directions.
4.9.1. Symmetries. The symmetric group Σn acts naturally on Mg,n
by permuting the n markings. Since both S∗
g,n and R∗(Mg,n) carry
induced Σn-representations and
q : S∗

g,n → R∗(Mg,n)

is a morphism of Σn-representations, the ideal of tautological relations
also carries an induced Σn-representation.

Pixton’s relations interact in interesting ways with the Σn-action.
For g > 0, Pixton proves [79, Proposition 2] that the new relations22 in
P d
g,n are generated by Σn-invariant tautological relations. For example,
both Getzler’s relation and the genus 2 relation displayed in Section
4.3 are new and invariant.

The symmetric group acts on the entire cohomology H∗(Mg,n). For
g ≤ 2, the symmetric group representations are well understood [4,
23, 24, 27, 29, 76], and there is signiﬁcant progress [5] in genus 3.
Constraints on the Σn-action on R∗(Mg,n) are proven in [22, Section
4] and show certain cohomology classes can not be tautological.
4.9.2. Push-forward relations. A tautological relation in S∗
g,n yields a
universal equation for the genus ≤ g Gromov-Witten theory of every
target variety X [51]. However, in genus 1, such tautological relations
do not appear to be enough to prove the Virasoro constraints [17] for
arbitrary targets [56]. Can any further universal equations in Gromov-
Witten theory be found in the geometry of the moduli spaces of curves?
An idea to ﬁnd further universal equations in Gromov-Witten theory

using push-forwards is the following. Consider the gluing map,

δ : Mg,2 → Mg+1 ,

21For another deﬁnition of R∗(Cn

g ) and further study of the relationship with

R∗(Mrt

g,n), see [77].

22The new relations are those which do not lie in the Q-span of relations coming

from lower genus, lower marking number, or lower codimension.

with image equal to the divisor ∆0 ⊂ Mg of curves with a nonseparat-
ing node. Elements of the kernel

δ∗ : R∗(Mg,2) → R∗+1(Mg+1)

yield universal equations for the genus ≤ g + 1 Gromov-Witten theory
of targets X with no genus g + 1 terms. Hence, elements of ker(δ∗)
yields universal equations for genus ≤ g Gromov-Witten theory.

sidering δ.

A push-forward relation is a nonzero element of

ker(δ∗ ◦ q)

ker(q) + ker((cid:101)δ)

.

Push-forward relations yield universal contraints in Gromov-Witten
theory which appear to go beyond the contraints obtained from tauto-
logical relations in S∗

g,n.

Are there any push-forward relations? Possible candidates were

found in [57]. Let r be even and satisfy 2 ≤ r ≤ g − 1. Deﬁne

Here, Γ• is the unique graph with no edges. By [57, Theorem 2],

δ∗q(χg,r) = 0 .

Moreover, the results of [57] show

χg,r /∈ ker(q) and χg,r /∈ ker((cid:101)δ) ,

but whether χg,r ever avoids the sum ker(q) + ker((cid:101)δ) is open.

Pixton’s relations can be used to search for push-forward relations
(via several related constructions) which have the possibility of produc-
ing new universal Gromov-Witten equations. What role such relations
will play in Gromov-Witten theory is not yet known.

5. Double ramification cycles

5.1. Overview. Curves of genus g which admit a map to P1 with
speciﬁed ramiﬁcation proﬁle µ over 0 ∈ P1 and ν over ∞ ∈ P1 deﬁne
a double ramiﬁcation cycle DRg(µ, ν) on the moduli space of curves.
The restriction of the double ramiﬁcation cycle to the moduli space of
nonsingular curves is a classical topic related to the linear equivalence
of divisors.

The cycle DRg(µ, ν) on the moduli space of stable curves is deﬁned
via the virtual fundamental class of the moduli space of stable maps
to rubber. An explicit formula for DRg(µ, ν) in the tautological ring,
conjectured by Pixton [81] in 2014 and proven in [43] in 2015, is pre-
sented here. Pixton’s double ramiﬁcation formula expresses the cycle
as a sum over stable graphs (corresponding to strata classes) with sum-
mands given by a product of leg and edge factors. The result shows
how the calculus of tautological classes works in practice.

5.2. Moduli of relative stable maps. Let µ = (µ1, . . . , µ(cid:96)(µ)) and
ν = (ν1, . . . , ν(cid:96)(ν)) be partitions of equal size,

(cid:96)(µ)(cid:88)

(cid:96)(ν)(cid:88)

µi =

νj .

Let C be a genus g curve. We consider maps

i=1

j=1

f : C → P1

with ramiﬁcation proﬁles µ over 0 ∈ P1 and and ν over ∞ ∈ P1. Two
such maps

are declared equivalent if f and (cid:98)f diﬀer by a reparameterization of the

f−→ P1 , C

C

target which keeps both 0 and ∞ ∈ P1 ﬁxed.

(cid:98)f−→ P1

A CALCULUS FOR THE MODULI SPACE OF CURVES

29

A natural compact moduli space of such maps f arises in Gromov-

Witten theory. Let

Mg(P1, µ, ν)∼

be the moduli space of stable relative maps to rubber with ramiﬁca-
tion proﬁles µ and ν. In the moduli of relative stable maps, f may
degenerate in several ways: the domain C may acquire nodes, f may
be constant on irreducible components of C, and the target P1 may
degenerate. The ﬁrst two phenomena are illustrated in the following
diagram.

We refer the reader to [53, 54, 55] for the basic deﬁnitions of relative
Gromov-Witten theory and the foundational development.

5.3. Double ramiﬁcation cycles. There is a natural morphism

ρ : Mg(P1, µ, ν)∼ → Mg,(cid:96)(µ)+(cid:96)(ν)

forgetting everything except the marked domain curve. The double
ramiﬁcation cycle is the push-forward of the virtual fundamental class23

(cid:104)Mg(P1, µ, ν)∼(cid:105)vir ∈ Ag(Mg,(cid:96)(µ)+(cid:96)(ν)) .

DRg(µ, ν) = ρ∗

Eliashberg asked in 2001: what is the formula for DRg(µ, ν)? As a ﬁrst
step, the double ramiﬁcation cycle was proven to lie in the tautological
ring in [21] in 2005,

DRg(µ, ν) ∈ Rg(Mg,(cid:96)(µ)+(cid:96)(ν)) .

The restriction of DRg(µ, ν) to the moduli space Mct
g,(cid:96)(µ)+(cid:96)(ν) of curves
of compact type can be calculated via the geometry of the universal
Jacobian.24 The result is Hain’s formula [35, 36].

23The expected dimension of Mg(P1, µ, ν)∼ is 3g − 3 + (cid:96)(µ) + (cid:96)(ν) − g where g

is the dimension of the Jacobian of the domain curve.

24The matching on the moduli space of curves of compact type of the deﬁnitions
of the double ramiﬁcation cycle via the virtual class and the Jacobian geometry is
not trivial and is proven in [11, 62].

5.4. Pixton’s formula.

5.4.1. Ramiﬁcation vector. We place the ramiﬁcation data in a vector

For any vector S = (s1, . . . , sn) with(cid:80)

(µ1, . . ., µ(cid:96)(µ),−ν1, . . .,−ν(cid:96)(ν)) .

i si = 0, we have

DRg,S ∈ Rg(Mg,n) .

The positive parts of S specify ramiﬁcation over 0 ∈ P1 and the negative
parts specify ramiﬁcation over ∞ ∈ P1. Free points corresponding to
part of S equal to 0 are also permitted.

Pixton [81] conjectured a beautiful formula for DRg,S ∈ Rg(Mg,n)

which involves a sum over admissible weightings of stable graphs.

5.4.2. Admissible weightings. Let S = (s1, . . ., sn) be double ramiﬁca-
tion data. Let Γ ∈ Gg,n be a stable graph of genus g with n legs. An
admissible weighting is a function on the set of half-edges,

w : H(Γ) → Z,

which satisﬁes:

(i) ∀hi ∈ L(Γ), w(hi) = si,
(ii) ∀e ∈ E(Γ) consisting of the half-edges h(e), h(cid:48)(e) ∈ H(Γ),

(iii) ∀v ∈ V(Γ),(cid:80)

w(h) + w(h(cid:48)) = 0 ,

v(h)=v w(h) = 0.

A stable graph Γ, however, may have inﬁnitely many admissible weight-
ings w.

In order to regularize the sum over admissible weightings, Pixton

introduced a regularization parameter
r ∈ Z>0 .

An admissible weighting mod r of Γ is a function,
w : H(Γ) → {0, . . ., r − 1},

which satisﬁes25 the conditions of (i-iii) above mod r. Let WΓ,r be the
set of admissible weightings mod r of Γ. The set WΓ,r is ﬁnite and can
be summed over.

25For example, for (i), we require w(hi) ≡ si mod r.

the degree d component of the class

For ﬁxed g, S, and d, the class Qd,r

Theorem 6 (Janda-P.-Pixton-Zvonkine 2015). For all g ≥ 0 and dou-
ble ramiﬁcation data S,

DRg,S = 2−g Pg

g,S ∈ Rg(Mg,n) .

When restricted to Mct

g,n, Theorem 6 recovers Hain’s formula.

The proof of Theorem 6 uses the equivariant Gromov-Witten theory

of P1 with:

• an orbifold BZr-point at 0 ∈ P1,
• a relative point at ∞ ∈ P1.

Hence, orbifold GW theory [1, 12], relative GW theory [53, 54, 55], and
the virtual localization formula [32] all play a role. Over BZr, Hurwitz-
Hodge integrals arise exactly in the form of [45] and are analysed via
Chiodo’s formula [13]. The double ramiﬁcation cycle arises over the
relative point ∞ ∈ P1.

In addition to conjecturing the formula of Theorem 6, Pixton [81]

conjectured the following vanishing proven in [14].
Theorem 7 (Clader-Janda 2015). For all g ≥ 0, double ramiﬁcation
data S, and d > g,

g,S = 0 ∈ Rd(Mg,n).
Pd

Clader and Janda further prove that the tautological relations obtained
from Theorem 7 are a consequence of Pixton’s set P discussed in Sec-
tion 4.6. For d < g, the classes Pd
g,S do not yet have a geometric
interpretation.
5.5. The Hodge bundle. Let g ≥ 2 and S = ∅, so µ = ν = ∅. Then,
the morphism ρ from the moduli of stable maps to the moduli of curves
is an isomorphism,

ρ : Mg(P1,∅,∅)∼ ∼−→ Mg .

By a study of the obstruction theory,

DRg,∅ = (−1)gλg ∈ Rg(Mg) ,

where λg is the top Chern class of the Hodge bundle

E → Mg .

Pixton’s formula in the S = ∅ case therefore yields an expression for
λg. By the analysis of [43, Section 0.5.3], the result is a new and very
special formula for λg: all the strata which appear are supported on

∆0 ⊂ Mg ,
the divisor with a nonseparating node.26

In the diagrams27 below, each labeled graph Γ describes a moduli

space MΓ, a tautological class γ, and a natural map

ξΓ : MΓ → Mg .

The convention in the diagrams is that the labeled graph represents
the cycle class

see Section 4.3.

ξΓ∗(γ) = q ([Γ, γ]) ,

26In particular, the vanishing

g = 0 ∈ R∗(Mg)
λ2

is an immediate consequence since λg|∆0 = 0.

27The diagrams (taken from [43]) are computed using code written by A. Pixton.

The artistic display is due to F. Janda.

5.6. Further formulas. Pixton’s formula for the double ramiﬁcation
cycle was presented here as an example. Several other formulas have
been recently studied (the Chern character of the Verlinde bundle [61],
the cycle class of the loci of holomorphic/meromorphic diﬀerentials
[25, Appendix]). The form of a summation over stable graphs Gg,n
with summands given by a product over vertex, leg, and edge factors
is ubiquitous (and reminiscent of Feynman expansions of integrals in
quantum ﬁeld theory).
