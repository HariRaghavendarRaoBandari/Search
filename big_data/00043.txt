It was recently realised that quantum theory allows for so-called causally nonseparable processes,
which are incompatible with any deﬁnite causal order. This was ﬁrst suggested on a rather abstract
level by the formalism of process matrices, which only assumes that quantum theory holds locally in
some observers’ laboratories, but does not impose a global causal structure; it was then shown, on a
more practical level, that the quantum switch—a new resource for quantum computation that goes
beyond causally ordered circuits—provided precisely a physical example of a causally nonseparable
process. To demonstrate that a given process is causally nonseparable, we introduced in [Araújo et
al., New J. Phys. 17, 102001 (2015)] the concept of witnesses of causal nonseparability. Here we
present a shorter introduction to this concept, and concentrate on some explicit examples to show
how to construct and use such witnesses in practice.

INTRODUCTION

In our common understanding of the world, we typic-
ally perceive events as happening one after another, in a
given order. Relations between events are understood in
terms of causes and eﬀects, where a cause can only pre-
cede an eﬀect. Events can thus be embedded in a causal
structure, which deﬁnes the causal order between them.
This viewpoint is ingrained for instance in the circuit
model for computation or information processing, where
operations are performed by gates that are applied in a
deﬁnite order. While the assumption that events follow a
deﬁnite causal order seems natural in the classical world,
one may nevertheless wonder whether it must really al-
ways be so. One may in particular become suspicious
when entering the quantum world, where the properties
of physical systems are not always well-deﬁned.

A general framework, that of process matrices, was
recently introduced to investigate physical processes
without pre-assuming a deﬁnite global causal structure;
the framework only assumes that quantum theory cor-
rectly describes what happens locally, in some observ-
ers’ laboratories [1].
It was shown that this allows for
processes that are incompatible with any deﬁnite causal
order—so-called causally nonseparable processes. The
framework was ﬁrst introduced on a rather abstract level,
with no clear physical interpretation given to the ﬁrst
examples of causally nonseparable processes. However,
a concrete physical example of a causally nonseparable
process was later exhibited [2, 3]: namely, the recently
proposed quantum switch, a new resource for quantum
computation where the order of operations is controlled
by a qubit in a superposition of two diﬀerent states—
which indeed does not ﬁt in the standard framework of
causally ordered quantum circuits [4].

To ensure that this notion of causal nonseparability has
any practical meaning, one needs of course to be able to
verify that a given process is causally nonseparable. This
was ﬁrst done in Ref. [1] through the violation of a causal
inequality—an inequality bounding the correlations com-

patible with a deﬁnite causal order, and whose violation
can only be obtained from a causally nonseparable pro-
cess. This is however a very strong argument for causal
nonseparability.
In fact, not all causally nonseparable
processes violate a causal inequality; the quantum switch
indeed provides such an example [2, 3].

More recently we introduced, in analogy with entangle-
ment witnesses, the concept of witnesses of causal non-
separability (or causal witnesses, as we initially called
them) [2]. Here a witness corresponds to an operator
that can (in principle) be ‘measured’ on a given process
by combining the statistics of various operations, and
whose expectation value, if negative, certiﬁes the causal
nonseparability of the process. We showed in particu-
lar that a witness can be eﬃciently constructed for any
causally nonseparable process.

The objective of this paper is to present a somewhat
shorter introduction to this new concept of witnesses of
causal nonseparability. We will avoid here some of the
technicalities in the proofs, and refer directly to Ref. [2]
for that. We will then present several diﬀerent expli-
cit examples of causally nonseparable processes and of
witnesses—in particular for the quantum switch, invest-
igating its robustness to diﬀerent kinds of noise—so as to
illustrate how to construct and use them in practice.

II. THE PROCESS MATRIX FORMALISM

A.

In the general bipartite case

Consider an experiment with two parties, Alice and
Bob, sitting in closed laboratories and exchanging phys-
ical systems. In a single run of the experiment, each party
opens their lab only once to let some incoming system
enter, and once to send some outgoing system out. They
can perform some operation on these systems, which may
output some result a for Alice and b for Bob.

While we do not pre-suppose a deﬁnite causal order
between the events happening in Alice and Bob’s labs,

we assume that what happens locally inside the labs is
correctly described by quantum theory. That means,
we can attach some Hilbert spaces HAI and HBI to
their incoming systems and some Hilbert spaces HAO
and HBO to their outgoing systems, and their choices
of operations correspond to so-called quantum instru-
ments [5]—i.e., sets of completely positive (CP) maps
which sum up to CP and trace-preserving maps [6].
These can conveniently be represented, using the Choi-
Jamiołkowski (CJ) isomorphism, by positive semideﬁn-
∈ BI ⊗ BO,
ite matrices M AI AO
where AI and AO (resp. BI and BO) denote the spaces of
Hermitian linear operators over Alice’s (Bob’s) incoming
and outgoing Hilbert spaces, and where the subscripts
refer to the outcomes a, b they correspond to. To deﬁne
valid instruments, these matrices must satisfy

(in general, superscripts on operators will refer to the
space they are acting on) and trX is the partial trace over
X. In this paper we will only consider ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces; the dimension of a Hilbert space HX will
be denoted dX.

1. Process matrices

The correlations established by Alice and Bob in
such a scenario can be described by the probabilities
P(M AI AO
) that Alice and Bob obtain the out-
comes a, b attached to the CP maps M AI AO
. As
shown in [1], these correlations can be written in the form

(with tr now denoting the full trace), for some Hermitian
matrix W ∈ AI ⊗ AO ⊗ BI ⊗ BO. This so-called pro-
cess matrix is the central object of the formalism; it de-
scribes the physical resource (the process) that connects
Alice and Bob’s labs, and generalises both the notion of
a quantum state—in which case Eq. (2) reduces to the
standard Born rule—and of a quantum channel; see Fig-
ure 1.
Not all matrices W ∈ AI ⊗ AO ⊗ BI ⊗ BO deﬁne valid
processes. As one can show [1, 2], the constraint that all
probabilities obtained through (2) must be nonnegative
and normalised (including in situations where Alice and
Bob may share and interact with ancillary entangled sys-
tems) leads to the following conditions that valid process
matrices must satisfy:

[1−BO]AI AO W = 0 ,
[1−AO]BI BO W = 0 ,
[1−AO][1−BO]W = 0 ,

Eqs. (3a)–(3c) deﬁne a linear subspace LV ⊂ AI ⊗
AO ⊗ BI ⊗ BO, which valid process matrices belong to.
Eq. (3d) tells us that process matrices are in the set P of
positive semideﬁnite matrices. We shall often ignore, for
convenience, the normalisation condition (3e), and deﬁne
the set of nonnormalised process matrices as W = LV ∩P;
as can easily be checked, this set is a closed convex cone.

2. Causally separable vs causally nonseparable processes

Processes that do not allow Bob to signal to Alice are
compatible with a causal order where Alice acts before
Bob, which we write A ≺ B. We shall generically de-
note by W A≺B the corresponding process matrices; these
simply represent standard, causally ordered quantum cir-
cuits. One can show that these are the matrices in
AI ⊗ AO ⊗ BI ⊗ BO, which satisfy [2, 7, 8]

(5c)
(5d)

W A≺B ≥ 0 ,
tr W A≺B = dO .

[1−BO]W A≺B = 0 , (5a)
[1−AO]BI BO W A≺B = 0 , (5b)
Note that Eqs. (5a)–(5b) imply Eqs. (3a)–(3c), which
ensures that the W A≺B matrices thus characterised are
valid process matrices. Eqs. (5a)–(5b) thus deﬁne a lin-
ear subspace LA≺B ⊂ LV . Together with Eq. (5c), we
can deﬁne the closed convex cone of nonnormalised pro-
cess matrices compatible with the causal order A ≺ B,
as W A≺B = LA≺B ∩ P.
Similarly, processes that do not allow Alice to sig-
nal to Bob are compatible with a causal order B ≺ A,

where Bob acts before Alice. The corresponding process
matrices W B≺A (which again simply represent standard,
causally ordered quantum circuits) satisfy

W B≺A ≥ 0 ,
tr W B≺A = dO .

[1−AO]W B≺A = 0 , (6a)
(6c)
[1−BO]AI AO W B≺A = 0 , (6b)
(6d)
Eqs. (6a)–(6b) deﬁne a linear subspace LB≺A ⊂ LV . To-
gether with Eq. (6c), we deﬁne the closed convex cone
of nonnormalised process matrices compatible with the
causal order B ≺ A, as W B≺A = LB≺A ∩ P.

One can still easily make sense of a convex mixture

W sep = q W A≺B + (1−q) W B≺A ,

(7)

representing a process that is compatible with the causal
order A ≺ B with some probability q ∈ [0, 1], and com-
patible with the causal order A ≺ B with some prob-
ability 1 − q. Process matrices that can be decomposed
in this form (or directly, the process they represent) are
said to be causally separable. Ignoring again the normal-
isation constraint, the set of nonnormalised causally sep-
arable process matrices also forms a closed convex cone,
obtained as the Minkowski sum1

Wsep = W A≺B + W B≺A

W A≺B + W B≺A(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)W A≺B ∈ W A≺B,
=n
W B≺A ∈ W B≺Ao

.

(8)

As ﬁrst proven in [1], there exist valid process matrices
that cannot be decomposed as in (7), and which are
therefore not in Wsep. These are called causally non-
separable, and represent processes that are incompatible
with any deﬁnite causal order—be it well-deﬁned, or only
determined with some probability.

B.

In a particular tripartite scenario

The scenario considered before can be generalised to
more parties. While it is fairly easy to construct and
characterise multipartite process matrices [1, 2, 9], de-
ﬁning the notion of causal (non)separability is somewhat
more subtle in such a setting [3, 10]. In Ref. [2] we re-
stricted our study to a speciﬁc tripartite scenario, whose
analysis matches that in the bipartite case quite closely
(note indeed the similarities between the equations below
and those in the previous subsection). We will again re-
strict ourselves to that case here, which is already quite
relevant in practice, as we will see with the example of
the quantum switch in Subsection IV B.

1 In Ref.

[2] we wrote, equivalently, Wsep = conv(W A≺B ∪

W B≺A), where conv denotes the convex hull.

In this particular scenario, the third party we intro-
duce, Charlie, only has an incoming system in a Hil-
bert space HCI (as before, we will denote by dCI
its
dimension, and by CI the space of Hermitian linear op-
erators acting on HCI), with no outgoing system—or
equivalently: Charlie has a trivial outgoing system, in
a trivial Hilbert space HCO ≡ C of dimension dCO = 1.
For a CP map M CI
applied by Charlie, which reduces
here to an element of a positive operator-valued meas-
ure (POVM) [2, 6], the generalised Born rule (2) simply
becomes

(10c)
with again dO = dAO dBO. Eqs. (10a)–(10c) deﬁne, as
before, a linear subspace LV ⊂ AI ⊗ AO ⊗ BI ⊗ BO ⊗
CI. We can again characterise the closed convex cone of
nonnormalised process matrices as W = LV ∩ P.

2. Causally separable vs causally nonseparable processes

Since we assume that Charlie does not send any out-
going system out of his lab, one can argue [2] that the
only relevant causal orders are those where he is last; we
are thus left to consider only the orders A ≺ B ≺ C and
B ≺ A ≺ C.
The process matrices W A≺B≺C that are compatible
with the causal order A ≺ B ≺ C (and which thus, again,
simply represent standard, causally ordered quantum cir-
cuits) are those, which satisfy [2, 7, 8]

[1−BO]CI W A≺B≺C = 0 ,
[1−AO]BI BOCI W A≺B≺C = 0 ,
W A≺B≺C ≥ 0 ,
tr W A≺B≺C = dO .

LA≺B≺C ⊂ LV . Together with Eq. (11c), we deﬁne the
closed convex cone of nonnormalised process matrices
compatible with the causal order A ≺ B ≺ C, as
W A≺B≺C = LA≺B≺C ∩ P.
Similarly, the process matrices W B≺A≺C that are com-
patible with the causal order B ≺ A ≺ C are those which

satisfy

(12a)
(12b)

[1−AO]CI W B≺A≺C = 0 ,

W B≺A≺C ≥ 0 ,
tr W B≺A≺C = dO .

(12c)
(12d)
Eqs. (12a)–(12b) deﬁne a linear subspace LB≺A≺C ⊂
LV . The closed convex cone of nonnormalised process
matrices compatible with the causal order B ≺ A ≺ C is
deﬁned here as W B≺A≺C = LB≺A≺C ∩ P.

In analogy with the previous case, any process matrix

in the present scenario that can be decomposed as

W sep = q W A≺B≺C + (1−q) W B≺A≺C ,

(13)
with q ∈ [0, 1], is called causally separable2. The set of
nonnormalised causally separable process matrices also
forms a closed convex cone, which can again be expressed
here as the Minkowski sum

Wsep = W A≺B≺C + W B≺A≺C .

(14)
Process matrices that cannot be decomposed as in (13),
and are thus not in Wsep, are called causally nonsepar-
able. These are incompatible with any deﬁnite causal
order (with Charlie last)—be it well-deﬁned, or only de-
termined with some probability.

III. WITNESSES OF CAUSAL

NONSEPARABILITY

A. Deﬁnition and characterisation

The concept of causal nonseparability represents a
new type of resource compatible (at least locally) with
quantum theory, which allows us to go beyond the stand-
ard framework of causally ordered quantum circuits [4].
An important question, to ensure this concept has some
concrete physical ground, is: how to detect it and verify
it in practice?

One possible approach, used by Oreshkov et al. in [1],
is through the violation of a so-called causal inequality—
namely, a bound on the correlations that are compatible
with a deﬁnite causal order. Since all correlations gen-
erated by causally separable processes must satisfy such
an inequality, a violation indeed ensures that the under-
lying process is causally nonseparable. Note that such
a demonstration is device-independent, in the sense that

4

one only looks at the observed correlations, without mak-
ing assumptions on what operations the devices perform.
Violating a causal inequality is however quite a strong
requirement. In fact, just as not all entangled quantum
states violate a Bell inequality [11, 12], not all causally
nonseparable processes violate a causal inequality [2, 3]
(an example being the quantum switch described below):
one must then use less stringent criteria to detect causal
nonseparability.

In Ref. [2] we introduced for that, in analogy with en-
tanglement witnesses [13, 14], the concept of witnesses
of causal nonseparability—which we simply abbreviated
(somewhat abusively) to causal witnesses. In this con-
text, a witness is deﬁned as any Hermitian operator S
such that

tr[S · W sep] ≥ 0

(15)
for all causally separable process matrices W sep. Since
the set of causally separable process matrices is con-
vex, then according to the separating hyperplane the-
orem [15], for any causally nonseparable W ns there must
always exist a witness such that tr[S · W ns] < 0, which
can thus be used to certify the causal nonseparability of
W ns; see Figure 2. Note that the measurement of a wit-
ness is a device-dependent test of causal nonseparability,
as the physical operations of the parties must faithfully
realise S to be able to test Eq. (15).
According to the above deﬁnition, and considering the
trace as the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product, the set S
of witnesses of causal nonseparability is simply the dual
cone (which we denote using an asterisk) of the cone of
nonnormalised causally separable process matrices:

S =(cid:8) S(cid:12)(cid:12) tr[S · W sep] ≥ 0 ∀ W sep ∈ Wsep(cid:9) = (Wsep)∗ .

(16)
In the bipartite and particular tripartite cases considered
here, this observation allows us to easily characterise the
sets of witnesses S, from the previous deﬁnitions of the
corresponding cones Wsep; see Appendix A.
Note that for any S⊥ in the orthogonal complement
L⊥
V of the linear subspace LV , and for any valid process
matrix W in W ⊂ LV , one has tr[S⊥ · W] = 0. Hence,
adding any term S⊥ ∈ L⊥
V to a witness S simply gives
another witness, giving the same value of tr[S · W] for
any valid W. By choosing for instance S⊥ = LV (S) − S,
where LV is the projector onto the linear subspace LV ,
one thus obtains a witness in LV . For practical reasons,
we will often be led to restrict the search of witnesses
within the subspace LV ; for that purpose we also deﬁne
the (closed convex) cone of witnesses in LV as SV =
S ∩ LV .

2 This deﬁnition of causal separability was proposed in [2] for the
particular tripartite case we consider here. Note that it is diﬀer-
ent from that proposed in [3] for general multipartite processes.
As can actually be shown [10], our deﬁnition here rather matches
the notion of extensible causal separability of Ref. [3].

B. Determining causal (non)separability

through semideﬁnite programming

To determine whether a given process is causally sep-
arable or not, one possible approach is to rephrase the

5

more explicit description of this problem in terms of pos-
itive semideﬁnite constraints; see Eqs. (B1) and (B3) for
the bipartite and tripartite cases, respectively. As can be
seen, solving this problem provides an explicit decompos-
ition of W(r∗), where r∗ is the optimal solution of (19),
as a convex combination of processes W A≺B and W B≺A.
In analogy with the robustness of entanglement [17], the
quantity max[r∗, 0] quantiﬁes the robustness of the pro-
cess W with respect to white noise—or random robust-
ness [2]. In particular, a value r∗ > 0 implies that W is
causally nonseparable.

The ‘primal’ SDP problem (19) is intimately linked to

its ‘dual’ problem, which is here [2]
min tr[S · W]

s.t. S ∈ SV

and

tr[S · 1◦] = 1 ,

(20)

and whose optimal solution S∗ provides precisely, in the
case where tr[S∗ · W] < 0, a witness of the causal non-
separability of W. Furthermore, the Duality Theorem
for SDP problems [16] implies that the solutions of the
primal and dual problems satisfy

r∗ = − tr[S∗ · W] .

(21)
It follows in particular that tr[S∗ · W(r)] < 0 for all r <
r∗, i.e. for all r such that W(r) is causally nonseparable:
this makes the witness S∗ optimal to detect the causal
nonseparability of W when subjected to white noise, see
Figure 2.

As for the primal problem, we provide in Appendix B
a more explicit description of the dual problem (20) that
is better suited for practical use; see Eqs. (B2) and (B4).
It is worth noting that, as discussed previously, adding
any term S⊥ ∈ L⊥
V to S will not change the value of
tr[S · W], nor of tr[S · 1◦]. Hence, the problem (20) is
formally equivalent to one, where the constraint S ∈ SV
would be replaced by S ∈ S; nevertheless, in practice, op-
timising over the whole (non-pointed) cone S may make
the numerical solvers unstable [2].

Note that depending on the practical physical imple-
mentation of a process W, diﬀerent noise models may
also be relevant. One could consider for instance a mix-
ture with another ﬁxed process W ◦, and thus replace 1◦
in the primal SDP problem (19) by W ◦. The normalisa-
tion constraint in the dual problem (20) would then be
replaced by tr[S · W ◦] = 1 and one can show, following
similar proofs to those of Ref. [2], that as long as W ◦ is
in the relative interior of Wsep (i.e., the interior of Wsep
within LV ), the SDP problems would still be solved eﬃ-
ciently, with their optimal solutions still satisfying (21).
Another case of interest is that of robustness to worst
case noise, as also considered in Ref. [2]. One can deﬁne
in this case the notion of generalised robustness (again
in analogy with entanglement [18]), which can also be
obtained through SDP. Interestingly, the generalised ro-
bustness can be used to deﬁne a proper measure of causal
nonseparability as it is (contrary to the random robust-
ness) monotonous under local operations [2].

Figure 2. The set of causally separable process matrices,
schematically represented by the inner ellipse, is closed and
convex. From the separating hyperplane theorem, for any
causally nonseparable process matrix W ns (in the larger el-
lipse containing all valid process matrices), there exists a
hyperplane, represented by the solid line, that separates it
from all causally separable process matrices W sep. That is,
there exists a Hermitian operator S—a witness of causal non-
separability—such that tr[S · W sep] ≥ 0 for all W sep, but
tr[S · W ns] < 0.
Solving the SDP problems of Subsection III B provides such
a witness, which is optimal with respect to the resistance of
W ns to white noise, represented by the process matrix 1◦: as
depicted on the Figure, it detects the causal nonseparability
1+r (W ns + r 1◦) for r lower
of all process matrices W ns(r) = 1
than the random robustness r∗ (directly obtained as a res-
ult of the SDP optimisation) above which W ns(r) becomes
causally separable.

question as an optimisation problem, and ask how much
noise can be added before it becomes causally separable.
Let us consider for now the case of ‘white noise’, rep-

resented by the process matrix
1◦ = 1
dI

(17)

with dI = dAI dBI or dI = dAI dBI dCI in the bipartite
and tripartite cases, and which prepares the incoming
systems of all parties in a maximally mixed state. For
a given process matrix W under consideration, we shall
consider the noisy process
W(r) = 1
1 + r

(cid:0)W + r 1◦(cid:1) ,

(18)

and investigate its causal nonseparability. Remember-
ing that the normalisation of W(r) is irrelevant to check
whether it is in the convex cone Wsep of causally separ-
able processes, this leads us to deﬁne the following op-
timisation problem:

min r

s.t. W + r 1◦ ∈ Wsep .

(19)

From the previous characterisation of the convex cone
Wsep, one can see that this deﬁnes a semideﬁnite pro-
gramming (SDP) problem [16], which can be solved eﬃ-
ciently. For ease of reference, we provide in Appendix B a

1 WsepWnsWns(r⇤)S1r⇤C.

Imposing further constraints on the witnesses

In order to ‘measure’ a witness S—i.e., to estimate the
value tr[S · W] (and check its sign)—one can in prin-
ciple simply decompose it as a linear combination of
products of CP (trace non-increasing) maps, implement
these maps (provided this can be done even if the causal
order between the parties is not well-deﬁned), estimate
their probabilities, and combine the statistics in an ap-
propriate way (as illustrated for instance in the next sec-
tion) [2].

In some cases, one may however not be able to imple-
ment all required CP maps, but may be restricted to CP
maps from a certain class only—e.g., one may only be
able to realise unitary operations. In that case, not all
witnesses can be measured, and it then makes sense to
restrict the search of witnesses to those that are imple-
mentable in practice. To do this, one can directly modify
the dual problem (20) and replace the search space SV
by the set ˜S ⊂ S of allowed witnesses (while no longer
necessarily restricting the search to witnesses within LV ).
Of course, with such an additional restriction the wit-
nesses we shall obtain may not be optimal, and we will
in general not be able to witness all causally nonsepar-
able processes. Nevertheless, this possibility to add some
constraints on the possible witnesses may be useful in
practice, as we will illustrate below with the quantum
switch.

IV. CASE STUDIES

Let us now consider a few concrete examples to illus-
trate how one can construct witnesses and characterise
causal nonseparability in practice. We start with a fam-
ily of bipartite processes investigated already in Ref. [19],
and then move on to the example of the quantum switch,
for which we will consider diﬀerent noise models and show
how to add speciﬁc constraints on the witnesses we shall
construct.

indicate to which system each operator is applied, and
tensor products are implicit. Wη1,η2 generalises in partic-
ular the process matrix originally considered in Ref. [1],
obtained for η1 = η2 = 1√

Wη1,η2 satisﬁes Eqs. (3a)–(3c) and (3e), and that it is pos-
itive semideﬁnite—hence, it is a valid process matrix—if
and only if η2

We solved, for diﬀerent values of η1, η2, the dual SDP
problem (20)—or rather, its more explicit formulation
given in (B2)—using the Matlab software CVX [20], and
obtained (up to numerical precision) the witnesses

(23)
where sgn is the sign function (for η1 = η2 = 1√

recover the witness obtained in Ref. [2]).
To verify that Sη1,η2 is indeed a valid witness, one can
check that BO Sη1,η2 ≥ 0 and AO Sη1,η2 ≥ 0: see the char-
acterisation of witnesses in the bipartite case given in
Appendix A 2 a. Applying Sη1,η2 to Wη1,η2, one gets

tr[Sη1,η2 · Wη1,η2] = 1 − |η1| − |η2| ,

(24)
which shows that Wη1,η2 is causally nonseparable (the
trace above is negative) for |η1|+|η2| > 1, and its random
η1,η2 = − tr[Sη1,η2 · Wη1,η2] =

|η1| + |η2| − 1.
For |η1| + |η2| ≤ 1 on the other hand, we ﬁnd
that Wη1,η2 is causally separable. Solving the primal
SDP problem (19)—or rather, its more explicit formula-
tion (B1)—provides an explicit decomposition as a con-
vex sum of processes compatible with a deﬁnite causal
order, in the form

In its simplest version, the quantum switch involves
two qubits—a control qubit and a target qubit. The tar-
get qubit, initially prepared in some state |ψi, is sent to
two parties, Alice and Bob, who act on it in an order that
is determined by the state of the control qubit: if the con-
trol qubit is in the state |0i, then Alice acts ﬁrst and Bob
acts second, while if it is in the state |1i, then Bob acts
ﬁrst and Alice second. The interesting situation is when
2(|0i + |1i), in
the control qubit is in a superposition 1√
which case Alice and Bob can be said to act ‘in a super-
position of orders’. After Alice and Bob’s operations, the
control qubit is sent to a third party, Charlie, who can
measure it.

As shown in Ref. [2] (see also [3]), the quantum switch

can be represented in terms of the ‘pure process’

|wi = 1√

where |1ii = |00i + |11i is the CJ representation of an
identity qubit channel. After tracing out the target qubit
in the system TI, we obtain the process matrix repres-
enting the quantum switch as3

,

Wswitch = trTI|wihw| .

(31)
Note that Wswitch ∈ AI ⊗AO⊗BI ⊗BO⊗CI (with dAI =
dAO = dBI = dBO = dCI = 2) and that Charlie has no
output system, so that we are indeed in the particular
tripartite case considered previously.

1. Robustness to white noise

To investigate the causal nonseparability of

the
quantum switch and construct a witness, one can follow
the approach described in Subsection III B. We solved the
SDP problems (19)–(20)—or rather, their more explicit
formulation (B3)–(B4)—numerically with CVX [20], and
found that the random robustness of the quantum switch
is

switch ’ 1.576 .

(32)

Alternatively, in terms of the ‘visibility’ v, this means
that the noisy quantum switch

switch(v) = v Wswitch + (1−v) 1◦

is causally nonseparable for all v ≥ v∗

from the dual SDP problem (20) is given in Appendix C 1.

Charlie, would could measure it together with the control qubit;
for simplicity we do not consider this possibility here.

Causally separable processes Wη1,η2 are restricted to the in-
ner square (|η1| + |η2| ≤ 1). Causally nonseparable processes
(such that |η1| + |η2| > 1) can be witnessed by Sη1,η2 (23),
represented (for the case η1, η2 ≥ 0) by the solid line. The
ﬁgure here is similar to Figure 2 of Ref. [19].

B. The quantum switch

The quantum switch is a circuit, which was proposed
to extend the framework of causally ordered quantum
circuits and allow the order in which gates are performed
to be coherently controlled by a quantum system [4].
As proven recently [2, 3], when analysed in the frame-
work of process matrices, the quantum switch provides
precisely an example of a (tripartite) causally nonsepar-
able process. It is in fact the ﬁrst practical example that
we know how to realise physically (and which has been
demonstrated experimentally [21]), as, to the best of our
knowledge, no practical realisation is known so far for any
of the causally nonseparable process matrices exhibited,
e.g., in Refs. [1, 9, 19, 22, 23].

8

In a practical implementation of the quantum switch,
other noise models than fully white noise can also be
relevant.

Consider for instance a situation where, for practical
reasons, the target qubit is well preserved throughout the
setup, but the control qubit is aﬀected by white noise:
with some probability v (which can be understood as a
‘visibility’), the state of the control qubit is untouched,
and with some probability 1 − v it is depolarised to the
fully ﬁxed state 1CI /2. The resulting noisy process then
writes

switch(v) = v Wswitch + (1−v) Wdepol

with
Wdepol = CI Wswitch

2 , (35)
which corresponds to a random mixture of a process
where the target qubit goes ﬁrst to Alice then to Bob,
and a process where it goes ﬁrst to Bob and then to
Alice.

One clearly sees that Wdepol is causally separable. As
it turns out,
it lies precisely on the boundary of the
set of causally separable processes; hence, some care
needs to be taken if one wants to investigate the causal
depol
(non)separability of W
switch(v) as discussed at the end
of Subsection III B. A possible approach is for instance
to mix the quantum switch with a process that is -close
to Wdepol (and let  → 0), inside the relative interior of
Wsep; or to directly calculate the random robustness of
W

depol
switch(v) for various ﬁxed values of v.
By doing so, we found numerically a positive random
robustness for all chosen values v > 0. In fact, one can

prove analytically that W
able whenever v > 0, by constructing a family of wit-
nesses S(v) such that tr[S(v) · W
depol
switch(v)] < 0 for all
v > 0; see Appendix C 2. That is, the causal nonsepar-
ability of the quantum switch is inﬁnitely robust to white
noise aﬀecting the control qubit only.

Figure 4 shows, for illustration, the two-dimensional
slice of the space of process matrices that contains
Wswitch, Wdepol and 1◦. By scanning this whole slice,
one can characterise using our SDP technique the limits
of the set of causally separable processes. One can clearly
see for instance that the whole line segment containing
depol
switch(v) with v > 0 is outside of it, and
the processes W
approaches it tangentially.

3. Dephasing the control qubit

Rather than fully depolarising the control qubit, it may
be relevant to investigate the case where it is only de-

matrices containing Wswitch, Wdepol and 1◦. The shaded re-
gion contains all valid (positive semideﬁnite) process matrices,
with the inner darker region containing the causally separable
processes. The causal nonseparability of Wswitch can be wit-
nessed using Sswitch, given explicitly in Appendix C 1, which
is optimal to test its robustness to white noise. All processes
switch(v) = v Wswitch + (1−v) Wdepol with 0 < v ≤ 1 are
W
causally nonseparable, as can be shown using a family of wit-
nesses given in Appendix C 2. The witness ˜S can be meas-
ured with Alice and Bob restricting their operations to unit-
aries; only the causally nonseparable processes outside of the
hatched region can be witnessed with this restriction.

before) the map

ρ → h0|ρ|0i|0ih0| + h1|ρ|1i|1ih1| ,

(36)

so that its coherence is lost.

We are thus led to consider here the noisy process

, (38)

which corresponds now to a situation where a clas-
sical control bit, in the state |0ih0|CI or |1ih1|CI with
equal probability, determines the order between Alice and
Bob—a process that we could call a classical switch.

Clearly, Wdeph is causally separable. Like Wdepol, it
also lies on the boundary of the set of causally separable
processes. One can again check numerically and prove
deph
switch(v) is caus-
analytically (see Appendix C 2) that W

switch is also inﬁnitely robust to dephasing noise aﬀect-

shows, for illustration, the two-dimensional slice of the
space of process matrices that contains Wswitch, Wdeph
and 1◦.

(42)
The resulting optimisation problem remains a SDP prob-
lem. Solving it with CVX, we obtained numerically an
explicit witness ˜S, given in Appendix C 3 and shown on
Figures 4 and 5, that detects the causal nonseparabil-
ity of the processes W 1◦
depol
switch(v) (34) and
switch(v) (37) down to v ’ 0.6641 (the same value for

all three).
Clearly, the price to pay by restricting Alice and Bob
to unitaries only is that not all causally nonseparable
processes can be witnessed; see the hatched regions in
Figures 4 and 5. Nevertheless, the amount of noise tol-
erated by ˜S is already good enough to measure it and
demonstrate causal nonseparability experimentally with
current technologies, e.g.
in a setup similar to that of
Ref. [21].

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper we have given an introduction to wit-
nesses of causal nonseparability [2], and illustrated this
concept on a few explicit examples. Witnesses of causal
nonseparability are somewhat analogous to entanglement
witnesses; however, a remarkable diﬀerence is that con-
trary to the latter, the former can be constructed eﬃ-
ciently, for any causally nonseparable processes (in the
bipartite and particular tripartite cases considered here),
using semideﬁnite programming.

Among the explicit examples given above, of particu-
lar interest is the quantum switch. This is indeed the
ﬁrst concrete example of a causally nonseparable process
that we know how to realise in practice, and for which we
know how to witness the causal nonseparability. We con-
structed its optimal witness with respect to white noise,
which detects its causal nonseparability down to a vis-
ibility of v ’ 0.3882. We further constructed a witness
that can be measured with Alice and Bob implementing
unitaries only, and which is robust to visibilities down to
v ’ 0.6441—whether we consider white noise, or depol-
arising or dephasing noise that aﬀects the control qubit
only. This allows for a feasible experimental veriﬁcation
of the causal nonseparability of the quantum switch that
would be more robust than with the witness previously
proposed in [2], which allows only for visibilities down
to v ’ 0.7381 (corresponding to a success probability
2 ’ 0.8690 for Chiribella’s task [24], as repor-
psucc = 1+v
ted in [2]). Note that in the latter, Charlie only performs
measurements in the X basis (while our witness also in-
volves the Y basis, see Appendix C 3); as it turns out,
that witness was actually optimal under this restriction,
as can be shown by further adding the corresponding con-
straint in the dual problem (20). Recall that the witness
obtained in [2] was constructed from Chiribella’s task

now Wswitch, Wdeph and 1◦. The process W
switch, symmet-
ric to Wswitch, is the process obtained when implementing
the quantum switch with a control qubit initially in the state
2(|0i + |1i) (whose description as
2(|0i − |1i) rather than 1√
1√
a process matrix is then obtained by replacing the ‘+’ sign by
a ‘−’ sign in Eq. (30)).

4. Restricting Alice and Bob’s operations to unitaries

To ﬁnish with, let us consider an implementation of
the quantum switch where Alice and Bob are restricted to
perform unitary operations. This restriction is motivated
by practical reasons: in the recent photonic implement-
ation of the quantum switch reported in Ref. [21] for ex-
ample, Alice and Bob only used passive optical elements,
namely half and quarter wave plates, realising (up to ex-
perimental imperfections) unitaries on the target qubit,
encoded in the photon polarisation. In particular, Alice
and Bob do not perform any actual measurement, and do
not need to record measurement outcomes (only Charlie
makes a measurement with diﬀerent possible outcomes).
As we show in Appendix C 3, the CJ representation
of a unitary operation U : HXI → HXO satisﬁes

M XI XO

U

XI M XI XO

U

= XO M XI XO

U

= XI XO M XI XO

U

.

(39)

Now, if Alice and Bob are restricted to perform unitary
operations, the witnesses that can be measured must be
of the form

S = X

γx,y,z,c M AI AO

Ux

⊗ M BI BO

Uy

⊗ M CI
c|z ,

(40)

x,y,z,c

for some unitaries Ux, Uy, for some CP maps (or simply:
POVM elements) M CI
c|z , and some real coeﬃcients γx,y,z,c.
Because of (39), S will then necessarily satisfy
AI S = AO S = AI AO S and BI S = BO S = BI BO S . (41)
Hence, to construct such a witness, one can simply
solve the dual SDP problem (20), replacing the constraint

WswitchWdeph1 ˜SSswitchWswitch of distinguishing between a commuting and an anticom-
muting channel, where the quantum switch provides an
advantage over any causally ordered circuit [24]. We note
indeed that the tool of witnesses of causal nonseparability
and the techniques developed to construct them may also
be useful to inspire and analyse possible applications of
causally nonseparable processes [24–26], and to quantify
their advantages over causally separable resources.

Let us ﬁnish by emphasising that in this paper, as
in Ref. [2], we only considered the bipartite case and a
particular tripartite case, where the third party has no
(or a trivial) outgoing system. Characterising and con-
structing witnesses in the general case remains so far an
open problem. Clearly, the sets of nonnormalised process
matrices and of witnesses remain closed convex cones,
and one can still write the optimisation problems (19)
and (20) as conic problems. However, whether the char-
acterisation of the cones Wsep and S(V ) would allow us
to write them as SDP problems that can be solved eﬃ-
ciently, and whether the duality relation (21) would still
hold, is left for future research.

Appendix A: Characterisation of the cones

Wsep, S and SV

In this Appendix we show how to explicitly charac-
terise the cones Wsep of (nonnormalised) causally separ-
able process matrices, and the cones S = (Wsep)∗ and
SV = S ∩ LV of witnesses of causal nonseparability, in
the bipartite and particular tripartite cases considered in
the main text.

In what follows here,

The characterisations below were ﬁrst obtained in
Ref. [2].
it is implicit that all
matrices under consideration are either in AI⊗AO⊗BI⊗
BO (in the bipartite case) or AI ⊗ AO ⊗ BI ⊗ BO ⊗ CI (in
the tripartite case); in particular, they are all Hermitian.

with W A≺B and W B≺A two positive semideﬁnite
matrices satisyﬁng (5a)–(5b) and (6a)–(6b), respectively.
Note that if W is already assumed to be a valid process
matrix in LV (hence, it satisﬁes in particular Eqs. (3a)
and (3b)), then assuming that W A≺B satisﬁes (5a) auto-
matically implies that W B≺A = W − W A≺B satis-
ﬁes (6b); similarly, assuming that W B≺A satisﬁes (6a)
automatically implies that W A≺B satisﬁes (5b). Hence,
to determine whether W ∈ LV is causally separable, it is
enough to check whether it can be decomposed as in (A1)
with W A≺B ≥ 0 and W B≺A ≥ 0 satisfying (5a) and (6a),
resp. Deﬁning the linear subspaces

L[1−BO] = {W | [1−BO]W = 0} ,
L[1−AO] = {W | [1−AO]W = 0} ,

(A2)
(A3)
the cone of (nonnormalised) causally separable process
matrices can then be characterised as [2]

Wsep = W A≺B + W B≺A

=(cid:2)(P ∩ L[1−BO]) + (P ∩ L[1−AO])(cid:3) ∩ LV . (A5)

(A4)

b. Tripartite case with dCO = 1

With similar arguments as in the bipartite case above,
we ﬁnd that in the particular tripartite case where
Charlie has a trivial outgoing system (dCO = 1), the cone
of (nonnormalised) causally separable process matrices
can be characterised as

(A6)

(A7)

(A8)

Wsep = W A≺B≺C + W B≺A≺C

=(cid:2)(P ∩ L[1−BO]CI)

with

L[1−BO]CI = {W | [1−BO]CI W = 0} ,
L[1−AO]CI = {W | [1−AO]CI W = 0} .

2. S and SV : Witnesses of causal nonseparability

As explained in the main text, the set of witnesses of
causal nonseparability is simply the dual cone of Wsep. It
can be characterised by using the previous descriptions of
Wsep, and making use of the following duality relations
for two nonempty closed convex cones K1,K2 [15]:

a. Bipartite case

According to Eq. (8), bipartite causally separable pro-

cess matrices can be written as

W = W A≺B + W B≺A

(A1)

Using (A5) and (A10), noting that the dual cone of a
linear subspace L is its orthogonal complement L⊥ and
that the cone P of positive semideﬁnite matrices is self-
dual, one can write, in the bipartite case,

S = (Wsep)∗

=(cid:2)(P + L⊥

(cid:3)(cid:2)1−[1−AO][1−BO](cid:3)W

[1−BO] = {S | [1−BO]S = S} =
{S | BO S = 0} and that the map S → BO S is positive,
[1−BO] = {S | BO S ≥ 0},
one can easily show [2] that P+L⊥
and similarly that P+L⊥
[1−AO] = {S | AO S ≥ 0}. Further-
V = {S|LV (S) = 0}, where LV is the pro-
more, one has L⊥
jector onto the linear subspace LV (= {S|LV (S) = S}),
which can be written as
LV (W)

S = n
LV (S⊥) = 0o
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) BO SP ≥ 0 , AO SP ≥ 0o

. (A14)
Furthermore, S = SP + S⊥ thus characterised is in LV
if and only if S = LV (SP + S⊥) = LV (SP ). Hence, we
also simply have

Combining this with (A12), we ﬁnd that

b. Tripartite case with dCO = 1

[1−BO]CI

S = (Wsep)∗

One could follow a similar reasoning as above to char-
acterise S in the tripartite case with dCO = 1, start-
ing from the characterisation of Wsep given by Eq. (A7).
However, because the map S → [1−(1−BO)CI]S is not pos-
itive (contrary to S → [1−(1−BO)]S = BO S), one cannot
simplify the characterisation of P + L⊥
—and ul-
timately of S—as much as before.
It is thus somewhat simpler here to start directly from
the characterisation of Wsep given by Eq. (A6). With
W A≺B≺C = P ∩LA≺B≺C and W B≺A≺C = P ∩LB≺A≺C,
we get, using again the relations (A10),

the primal and dual SDP problems (19) and (20) in more
explicit forms, which can readily be implemented and
solved on a computer.

1. Bipartite case

Using the characterisation of Eq. (A5), and noting that
for W ∈ LV , W + r1◦ is also automatically in LV , one
can write explicitly the primal SDP problem (19) in the
bipartite case as

min r

s.t. W + r 1◦ = W A≺B + W B≺A ,
W A≺B ≥ 0 ,
[1−BO]W A≺B = 0 ,
W B≺A ≥ 0 ,
[1−AO]W B≺A = 0 .

(B1)

Using now Eq. (A15), the dual SDP problem (20)

writes, more explicitly,

min tr[S · W]

s.t. S = LV (SP ) , BO SP ≥ 0 , AO SP ≥ 0 ,

tr[S · 1◦] = 1 ,

(B2)

with LV deﬁned in Eq. (A13).

2. Tripartite case with dCO = 1

Using Eq. (A7), the primal SDP problem (19) can be
written explicitly, in the tripartite case with dCO = 1, as

min r

s.t. W + r 1◦ = W A≺B≺C + W B≺A≺C ,
W A≺B≺C ≥ 0 ,
[1−BO]CI W A≺B≺C = 0 ,
W B≺A≺C ≥ 0 ,
[1−AO]CI W B≺A≺C = 0 .

(B3)

SV = { S ∈ S | LV (S) = S }

(A19)

Using now Eqs. (A16) and (A19), the dual SDP prob-

lem (20) writes, more explicitly,
min tr[S · W]
ABC = SP
ABC ≥ 0 , LA≺B≺C(S⊥
SP
BAC ≥ 0 , LB≺A≺C(S⊥

S = LV (S) , tr[S · 1◦] = 1 ,

s.t. S = SP

(B4)

with LA≺B≺C, LB≺A≺C and LV deﬁned in Eqs. (A17),
(A18) and (A20).

Appendix C: Witnesses for the quantum switch

In this Appendix we give explicit witnesses of the
causal nonseparability of the quantum switch. Although
the results reported in the main text do not depend on
the initial state |ψi of the target qubit, the speciﬁc form
of the witnesses does; in the following we ﬁx it to be
|ψi = |0i.

For ease of notations, we will provide the various wit-

nesses in the general form

Due to the symmetries of the quantum switch and its

(C4)

for σi = 1, X, Y, Z, and where the sign is + if σ5 = 1
or X, and − if σ5 = Y or Z. (Note that all processes
W and all witnesses S considered for the tripartite case
in this paper have the symmetry W = FA↔B(W), S =
FA↔B(S).)

a. Constraints on the CJ representation of a unitary

U

Following the convention of [1], the Choi-Jamiołkowski
representation of a unitary operation U : HXI → HXO is
deﬁned as

where 1 is the identity operator on HXI,

(C14)
|1ii ≡
j|jiXI ⊗ |jiXI ∈ HXI ⊗ HXI is a (non-
normalised) maximally entangled state, {|jiXI} is an or-
thonormal basis of HXI, and T denotes matrix transpos-
ition in that basis.

Note ﬁrst that U is a completely positive and trace-

obtained numerically the witness ˜S and the correspond-

such decompositions are not unique; one may choose to
use a diﬀerent set of unitaries to decompose ˜S—e.g. one
may want to minimise the number of diﬀerent unitaries
to implement (given the dimensions in play, one can do
with 10 for Alice and 10 for Bob), or the total number of
diﬀerent terms in the decomposition of ˜S.
