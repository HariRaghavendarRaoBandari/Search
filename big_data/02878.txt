Abstract: We consider the most general, classically-conformal, three-dimensional N = 1
Chern-Simons-matter theory with global symmetry Sp(2) and gauge group U (N )× U (N ).
We show that the Lagrangian in the on-shell formulation of the theory admits one more
free parameter as compared to the theory formulated in oﬀ-shell N = 1 superspace. The
theory on T 3 can be formally localized to a matrix model. We carry out the localization
procedure for the theory on T 3 with periodic boundary conditions. In particular we show
that restricting to the saddle points with vanishing gauge connection gives a trivial contri-
bution to the partition function, i.e. the bosonic and fermionic contributions exactly cancel
each other.

Introduction

Using localization, several exact results have by now been obtained for supersymmetric
gauge theories, such as the computation of indices, partition functions and Wilson loops,
among others. In many cases these exact computations have provided us with checks of
non-trivial dualities, including AdS/CFT.

In the present paper we apply the localization procedure to the most general, classically-
conformal, three-dimensional N = 1 Chern-Simons-matter theory with global symmetry
Sp(2) and gauge group U (N ) × U (N ). Previously, localization had mainly been used to
study theories on curved spacetimes with non-trivial R-symmetry [1–10]. We show that
the N = 1 theory on a ﬂat three-dimensional torus T 3 can also be formally reduced to a
matrix model.

The N = 1 theory we consider here is not in general superconformal on the quantum
level, except for special points in its moduli space where supersymmetry may be enhanced.
In particular the ABJM model [11] is one such special point where supersymmetry is
enchanced to N = 6. By considering a classically-conformal N = 1 theory with unequal
Chern-Simons (CS) levels which is in a certain sense a small deformation of the ABJM
model [11], it was argued in [12] that the theory ﬂows to an RG ﬁxed point in the infrared.
These CFT’s were then conjectured in [12] to be dual to certain (massive) IIA supergavity
solutions [13, 14] which fall within the general class of [15].

The outline of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we give the on-shell formulation of
the most general classically-conformal N = 1 U (N ) × U (N ) CS-matter theory with Sp(2)
global symmetry. We then introduce auxiliary ﬁelds and formulate the theory oﬀ-shell, as
required by the localization procedure. An interesting observation is that the Lagrangian
in the on-shell formulation of the theory admits one more free parameter as compared to
the theory formulated in oﬀ-shell N = 1 superspace.

In section 3 we formulate the theory on a curved manifold. One notable diﬀerence
from the CS theories with N = 2 supersymmetry studied in [2] is that localization requires
the theory to be on T 3, excluding in particular positive-curvature manifolds such as S3.
Hyperbolic three-dimensional space would also preserve superconformal symmetry at the
classical level. We however discard this possibility and instead demand that the manifold
should be compact, in order to ensure that the partition function is well-deﬁned.

We next carry out the localization procedure for the theory on T 3 with periodic bound-
ary conditions. In particular we compute the contributions to the partition function from
the locus of saddle points with vanishing gauge connection. We show that restricting to this
locus gives a trivial contribution to the partition function, i.e. the bosonic and fermionic
contributions exactly cancel each other. We conclude with a discussion of our results in
section 4. Further technical details can be found in the appendices.

2.1 On-Shell

The general component form of the on-shell N = 1 classically-superconformal CS La-
grangian with Spin(5) ≃ Sp(2) global symmetry and gauge group U (N ) × U (N ) is given
in [16]:

L = LCS + Lkin + L4 + L6 ,

(2.1)

where LCS is the pure CS Lagrangian, Lkin is the matter kinetic term, L4 is the quartic
interaction and L6 is the sextic potential. More speciﬁcally,1

the (N, ¯N ), and similarly for ΨA, ΨA. The most general quartic interaction terms can be
written in the form L4 = L4a + L4b + L4c + L′, where:

2.2 Oﬀ-Shell

In the previous section we studied the on-shell formulation of the theory. However to
carry out the localization procedure one needs oﬀ-shell supersymmetry. For that purpose
we introduce the auxiliary scalar ﬁelds F and the gaugini λ, ˆλ in the scalar and gauge
multiplets, respectively. The oﬀ-shell action reads:

L = LCS + Lkin + Lpotential ,

We note that besides k1, k2 the oﬀ-shell theory has only three free parameters, as can be
seen from (2.13). This is one fewer parameter than in the on-shell formulation. Speciﬁcally,
after replacing the auxiliary ﬁeld F and gaugini λ, ˆλ by the solutions of their respective
equations of motion, the Lagrangian (2.8) goes back to (2.1), but with α4,3 = 0 in Lpot. In
other words, for the on-shell theory obtained by starting from (2.8) and then eliminating
the auxiliary ﬁelds, m is not an independent parameter but is equal to −4α2,2α3, which in
its turn can be expressed in terms of α1, ¯α1 and ¯ai. This can be understood from the fact
that the sextic potential XAX BXC X AXBX C in Lpot cannot be obtained from the oﬀ-shell
Lagrangian by replacing F by its solution.

In the following we will put the theory on a curved manifold. More speciﬁcally, to go

from ﬂat to curved spacetime one needs to:

• covariantize all derivatives,
• introduce additional terms 1

tions of ΨA and ΨA, respectively,

3 ΩABX Bγµ∇µǫ and 1

3 ΩABXBγµ∇µǫ in the transforma-

• have ǫ satisfy the conformal Killing spinor equation:

∇µǫ = γµη ,

(2.15)

where η is some arbitrary spinor,

• add a scalar-curvature coupling term, − 1

8 RX AXA, to the Lagrangian.

The resulting curved-space Lagrangian will be used in the next section.

3 Localization

In order to apply the localization procedure, the theory must be invariant under the action
of a fermionic symmetry δ which is nilpotent, δ2 = 0, or more generally squares to a
symmetry of the theory. Deforming the action by a δ-exact term,

S −→ S + tδV ,

(3.1)

leaves invariant the expectation values of δ-closed operators. Hence we may take the limit
t → ∞, upon which the theory localizes to the set Σ of critical points of δV [17]. In this

– 6 –

limit the path integral can be performed by restricting S to Σ and computing a one-loop
determinant describing the ﬂuctuations normal to Σ. This procedure was ﬁrst carried out
in detail in [1] for the case of SYM on the round S4.

In order for the path integral to be well-deﬁned, we will consider the theory in Eu-
clidean signature. All ﬁelds are then complexiﬁed, while the action becomes a holomorphic
functional in the space of complexiﬁed ﬁelds. This procedure is known under the name
of “holomorphic complexiﬁcation” and ensures that supersymmetry is preserved, see e.g.
[18]. Following [1] our strategy will be to choose a path-integration contour in the space
of ﬁelds, such that when restricted to that contour the deformation δV becomes a sum of
positive semi-deﬁnite terms. The locus Σ will then be determined by the condition that
each term in the sum vanishes.

3.1 Setup

As explained above, in order to apply the localization procedure we need to pass from
Lorentzian to Euclidean signature, where all ﬁelds become complex. Moreover ǫµνρ in the
CS piece of the Lagrangian becomes iǫµνρ.

We then deform the action by adding a term tδV such that δ2V = 0. For theories with
N > 2 supersymmetry, one can have δ2 = 0 on all ﬁelds of the theory. However, this is
not possible for the N = 1 superalgebra. Instead, as we will show later, for N = 1 we can
require that δ squares to a transformation in the isometry group of the manifold, which in
turn leads to δ2V = 0 upon volume integration.

Furthermore we must restrict the supersymmetry parameter ǫ to satisfy the Killing

spinor equation:2

∇µǫ = Sγµǫ ,

(3.2)

where S is in general a complex function. The reason for restricting to this Killing spinor
equation instead of the more general one (2.15) is the following. Equation (2.15) would in
general imply that δ2 induces not only a translation, a rotation and a gauge transformation
but also a dilatation, which would break the invariance of the deformation δV .

Under the assumption of smoothness, any solution to the Killing spinor equation which
is not identically zero is nowhere-vanishing on the manifold. This follows from the fact that
(3.2) is a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation, hence if the Killing spinor vanishes at any one
point it must vanish everywhere.

Given a nowhere-vanishing Killing spinor ǫ, any spinor Ψ can be decomposed as follows:

Ψ = Ψ+ǫ + Ψ−ǫc ,

(3.3)

where Ψ± are anticommuting scalars; our conventions are explained in appendix C. From
now on we require the supersymmetry parameters to be commuting. The oﬀ-shell La-
grangian given in section 2 remains invariant under supersymmetry with these commuting

2A detailed analysis of this Killing spinor equation in Lorentzian signature is given in section 3 of [19].

give:

δ2λ = −iV µDµλ − iSV µγµλ
δ2ˆλ = −iV µDµˆλ − iSV µγµˆλ .

(3.9)

(3.10)

As explained in Appendix C, V µ can be identiﬁed as part of the orthonormal frame that
trivializes the tangent bundle of the manifold. Therefore, apart from additional terms
which can be interpreted as gauge transformations or rotations, δ2 acting on each ﬁeld
gives a translation along V µ.

In the next section we will ultimately set a = 1 and S = 0, upon which the above

equations simplify further.

3.2 Deformations

3.2.1 Matter Sector

To localize the matter sector, we ﬁrst consider the deformation,

δV =Z √gd3xδ[(δΨA)†ΨA] ,

where we have deﬁned:

(δΨA)† ≡ ΩABǫ†γµDµXB + S∗ΩABXBǫ† + iΩABFBǫ† .

(3.11)

(3.12)

Note that at generic points in ﬁeld space (δΨA)† is not the adjoint of δΨA, and δV as
deﬁned in (3.11) is a holomorphic functional in the space of complexiﬁed ﬁelds.

– 9 –

As explained in section 3, we will choose a path-integration contour C in the space
of ﬁelds such that when restricted to C the deformation δV becomes a sum of positive
semi-deﬁnite terms. This requirement selects C as the subspace where the ﬁelds satisfy the
reality condition:

Contour C :

X A† = XA , F A† = FA ,
µ = ˆAµ .

µ = Aµ , ˆA†

A†

Moreover the integrand in (3.11) is given by:

δ[(δΨA)†ΨA] = δ(δΨA)†ΨA + (δΨA)†δΨA .

(3.13)

(3.14)

Recall that the supersymmetry transformation δ is anticommuting; the relative sign on the
right-hand side is positive since (δΨA)† is bosonic.

Let us now verify that the deformation is δ-closed. From (3.14) we obtain:
δ2[(δΨA)†ΨA] =δ2(δΨA)†ΨA − δ(δΨA)†δΨA + δ(δΨA)†δΨA + (δΨA)†δ2ΨA

=δ2(δΨA)†ΨA + (δΨA)†δ2ΨA .

(3.15)

The second term in the second line can be read oﬀ from (3.9). One can obtain the ﬁrst
term in the second line from (3.9) and (3.12):

δ2(δΨA)†ΨA = − iV µDµ[(δΨA)†]ΨA + iS∗V µ(δΨA)†γµΨA

+ 2iS∗ΩABVµDν XBǫ†γµν ΨA − 2iSΩABVµDν XBǫ†γµν ΨA ,

where we used ∇µǫc = −S∗γµǫc and chose S to be a constant. Finally,

δ2[(δΨA)†ΨA] = − iV µ∂µ[(δΨA)†ΨA]

+ iS∗V µ(δΨA)†γµΨA − iSV µ(δΨA)†γµΨA
+ 2iS∗ΩABVµDν XBǫ†γµν ΨA − 2iSΩABVµDν XBǫ†γµν ΨA .

(3.16)

(3.17)

This vanishes under the volume integration if and only if S is real constant. On the other
hand the integrability condition of the Killing spinor (3.2) relates the constant S to the
curvature scalar of the manifold:

R = −24S2 .

(3.18)

If S is nonvanishing, this would allow hyperbolic space as a solution. In the following we
will discard this possibility and instead demand that the manifold should be compact, in
order to ensure that the partition function is well-deﬁned.

On T 3, the curvature scalar vanishes and so does S. This implies that the Killing
spinor is constant and nowhere-vanishing. Moreover, in (3.9) and (3.10), with vanishing
S terms, δ2 gives a translation and a gauge transformation on all ﬁelds. δ-exactness and
δ-closedness of the deformation are thus guaranteed.

We will henceforth restrict the manifold to be T 3. We normalize the constant Killing

spinor such that ˜ǫǫc = 1. The bosonic part of the deformation (3.14) is:

(δΨA)†δΨA =DµXADµX A + iǫµνρUρDµXADνX A + FAF A

+ iU µDµX AFA − iU µDµXAF A ,

without loss of generality. When restricted to the contour C, cf. (3.13), the bosonic part of
the deformation is positive semi-deﬁnite, and the saddle points where it vanishes are given
by:

D1XA + iD2XA = 0 , D3X − iF = 0 .

(3.20)

Hence with this deformation alone the theory does not reduce to a matrix integral with
discrete saddle points: one can always choose some nontrivial functions for XA and F
so that (3.20) is satisﬁed. We therefore add another term δ[(δΨA)†ΨA] to the original
deformation:

(δΨA)†δΨA + (δΨA)†δΨA =DµXADµX A + iǫµνρUρDµXADνX A + FAF A

+ iU µDµX AFA − iU µDµXAF A
+ DµXADµX A − iǫµνρUρDµXADν X A + FAF A
− iU µDµX AFA + iU µDµXAF A

=2{DµXADµX A + FAF A} .

(3.21)

When restricted to the contour C, the two terms in the last line are both positive semi-
deﬁnite, and the critical points are given by:

DµXA = FA = 0 .

(3.22)

3.2.2 Gauge Sector

A δ-closed deformation for the gauge sector is:

Z d3xnδ[(δλ)†λ] + δ[(δˆλ)†ˆλ]o ,

where we have deﬁned:

(δλ)† ≡ −ǫ†γµν F µν ;

(δˆλ)† ≡ −ǫ†γµν ˆF µν ,

(3.23)

(3.24)

so that the deformation (3.23) is a holomorphic functional of the complexiﬁed ﬁelds. Note
in particular that (δλ)† is not the adjoint of δλ at generic points in ﬁeld space, but only
when restricted to the contour C, cf. (3.13).

The bosonic part of the deformation (3.23) is given by:

(δλ)†δλ + (δˆλ)†δˆλ =

(3.25)

When restricted to the contour C this becomes a sum of positive semi-deﬁnite terms, with
critical points given by:

Fµν = ˆFµν = 0 .

3.3 Gauge Fixing

We now introduce the usual ghost and anti-ghost action to ﬁx the inﬁnite degrees of freedom
of the gauge ﬁelds. The ghost term is not invariant under supersymmetry, so one cannot
immediately proceed to do localization. To deal with this, we follow [1, 2], and introduce
a new fermionic symmetry ∆:

∆ ≡ δQ + δB ,

where δQ stands for supersymmetry and δB for BRST transformation.

Under a BRST transformation, we have:

δBAµ = ∂µC + i[Aµ, C] , δBλ = −i{λ, C} .

(3.27)

(3.28)

and similarly for ˆA, ˆλ. Here C is the usual anti-commuting ghost ﬁeld. It transforms under
supersymmetry and BRST as:

δQC = 0 , ∆C = δBC = a0 −

i
2{C, C} , ∆a0 = 0 ,

(3.29)

where a0 is a constant ghost-for-ghost ﬁeld that takes care of the zero mode of C. With
this combined transformation, one can verify that:

∆2Aµ = − iV νFνµ + i[Aµ, a0] ,
∆2λ = − iV µDµλ + i[λ, a0] ,
∆2C =i[C, a0] .

The rest of the ghost complex transforms under ∆ as:

∆ ¯C = b , ∆b = −iV · D ¯C + i[ ¯C, a0] ,
∆¯a0 = ¯C0 , ∆ ¯C0 = i[¯a0, a0] ,
∆b0 = C0 , ∆C0 = [V · A, b0] + [Aµ, ∂µ(V · A)] − i (cid:3)(V · A) + i[b0, a0] ,

(3.30)

(3.31)

where ¯C is the anti-ghost, and b is the Lagrangian multiplier; ¯a0,b0,C0 and ¯C0 are constant
ﬁelds needed to ﬁx the zero modes of the ghosts and b.

The gauge-ﬁxing action is:

iZ d3xtr{∆[ ¯C(∂µAµ + b0) − C¯a0]}
=iZ d3xtr{b(∂µAµ + b0) − ¯C(∂µDµC + ∂µδQAµ + C0)
− (a0 −

i
2{C, C})¯a0 + C ¯C0} .

(3.32)

Note that the ghost, the anti-ghost and the transformation ∆ are all anti-commuting. In
Appendix D we show that the integration over all ﬁelds in the ghost complex gives the

– 12 –

Lorentz gauge. Now this action is invariant under ∆ transformation:

∆2[ ¯C(∂µAµ + b0) − C¯a0]
=∆2( ¯C)(∂µAµ + b0) + ¯C(∂µ∆2(Aµ) + ∆2(b0))

− ∆2(C)¯a0 − C∆2(¯a0)

=∆2( ¯C)(∂µAµ + b0) + ¯C(∂µ∆2(Aµ) + ∆2(b0))

− i[C, a0]¯a0 − iC[¯a0, a0] .

(3.33)

The last two terms cancel under the trace. The ﬁrst two can also be shown to cancel:

Z d3xtr{∆2( ¯C)(∂µAµ + b0) + ¯C(∂µ∆2(Aµ) + ∆2(b0))}
=Z d3xtr{(−iV · D ¯C + i[ ¯C, a0])(∂µAµ + b0)
+ ¯C∂µ(−iV νFνµ + i[Aµ, a0])
+ ¯C([V · A, b0] + [Aµ, ∂µ(V · A)] − i (cid:3)(V · A) + i[b0, a0])}
=Z d3xtr{i[ ¯C, a0](∂ · A + b0) + i ¯C([∂ · A + b0, a0])
− iV · ∂[ ¯C(∂ · A + b0)] + [V · A, ¯C](∂ · A + b0)
+ ¯C[V · A, ∂ · A + b0] + i ¯C (cid:3)(V · A) − i ¯C (cid:3)(V · A)
¯C[∂µ(V · A), Aµ] + ¯C[Aµ, ∂µ(V · A)]}
=0 .

(3.34)

3.4 Saddle Points

For the gauge sector we replace δ by ∆ in (3.23) and modify the deformation as follows:

∆Vgauge =Z dx3∆tr{
=Z dx3tr{

1
2

1
ǫ†γµν Fµν λ}
2
Fµν F µν − i˜λ /Dλ} ,

(3.35)

and similarly for the hatted ﬁelds. This deformation is ∆-exact and ∆-closed. For the
matter sector, ∆ is deﬁned to be the same as δ, and the deformation is:

∆Vmatter =Z dx3tr{∆[(∆ΨA)†ΨA + (∆ΨA)†ΨA]}

=2Z dx3tr{DµXADµX A + FAF A − i ˜ΨA /DΨA
˜ˆλX BΨA − ΩABXB

+ ΩAB ˜λXBΨA + ΩAB

˜ˆλΨA − ΩABX B ˜λΨA} .

The gauge sector localizes to:

Fµν = 0 ; λ = 0 ,

(3.36)

(3.37)

where we have restricted to the contour C, cf. (3.13). In particular the saddle points of
the gauge ﬁeld correspond to ﬂat gauge connections over the Euclidean three-torus. For a

– 13 –

simply-connected gauge group π1(G) = 0, such as G = SU (N )× SU (N ), this implies that:
(3.38)

Aµ = ci

µHi ,

where ci’s are constants and {Hi}, i = 1,··· , rank(G), is the Cartan subalgebra of G.
[20, 21]): Since Aµ is a ﬂat connection there exists
This can be seen as follows (see e.g.
a group element U ∈ G such that Aµ = −i∂µU U −1, at least locally.
I.e. U need not
be globally deﬁned but is allowed to undergo G-valued jumps as we wind around each of
the three circles of the torus. More explicitly, suppose we have a square torus of radius
L parameterized by {xµ ∈ [0, L]}. The group element U (x1, x2, x3) obeys nontrivial, in
general, boundary conditions which may be parameterized as follows,

U (x1 + L, x2, x3) = U (x1, x2, x3)Ω1 ;
U (x1, x2 + L, x3) = U (x1, x2, x3)Ω2 ;
U (x1, x2, x3 + L) = U (x1, x2, x3)Ω3 ,

(3.39)

for some constant Ωµ ∈ G. In addition, for consistency, Ωµ must mutally commute. In-
deed going once around the circle parameterized by xµ and then once around the circle
parameterized by xν must produce the same jump in U as when going ﬁrst around the xν
direction and then along xµ. This implies, taking (3.39) into account,

[Ωµ, Ων] = 0 .

(3.40)

For a unitary group G, as is the case in the present paper, this implies that Ωµ can be put
in the form:

Ωµ = exp(iLcj

µHj) ,

(3.41)

up to similarity transformation. Recalling the relation between Aµ and U we are thus led
to the result cited in (3.38), provided we can show that for any set of mutally commuting
Ωµ’s we can always construct a group element U ∼ exp(ixµcj

µHj) obeying (3.39).

The proof of the last step proceeds by showing that there is no obstruction in construct-
ing an element U (x1x2, x3) on the edges of a cube of side L such that (3.39) is satisﬁed.
Then U can be continued on the faces of the cube provided π1(G) = 0, and ﬁnally in the
interior provided π2(G) = 0, which holds true for G = SU (N ) × SU (N ).

An important observation is that the constants ci

µ should be understood as periodic

variables with periodic identiﬁcation,

ci
µ ∼ ci

µ +

2π
L

.

(3.42)

This can be seen by performing a gauge transformation generated by U = exp( 2πi
L xµHi),
which shifts Aµ in accordance with (3.42). On the other hand the element U thus deﬁned
is periodic3, i.e. as we wind around the xµ direction of the torus it forms a closed loop in
group space. But since the group is simply connected U may be continuously deformed to

3We are adopting the normalization exp(2πiHi) = 1.

– 14 –

the identity, and the gauge transformation generated by U should act trivially on all ﬁelds
of the theory. We thus arrive at the identiﬁcation (3.42).

It follows from the above that the ci

µ’s can be constrained to take values in [0, 2π
L ].
In particular taking the inﬁnite-volume limit of the torus, L → ∞, we conclude that the
only solution to (3.37) is the trivial ﬂat connection Aµ = 0. Of course on R3 there is no
obstruction to gauging away any ﬂat connection of the form (3.38). The point is that we
can formally reproduce this result by considering R3 as the inﬁnite-volume limit of T 3.

The case of G = U (N ) × U (N ) presents one crucial diﬀerence: π1(U (N )) ∼= Z and

thus G is not simply connected. By considering the decomposition of the algebra-valued
connection along the G-generators it is not very diﬃcult to see that we may still put the
most general ﬂat connection in the form (3.38),

Aµ = ci

µHi + dµJ + eµK ,

(3.43)

where the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is as in the case of SU (N ) × SU (N ); dµ,
eµ are constants; J, K are the two additional u(1) Cartan generators coming from the
decomposition:

u(N ) ⊕ u(N ) ∼= su(N ) ⊕ su(N ) ⊕ u(1) ⊕ u(1) .

(3.44)

Now the previous argument which allowed us to conclude that ci
µ are periodic does not go
through for the variables dµ, eµ. The reason is that the gauge transformations generated
by U = exp( 2πi
L xµK) form closed loops in the group space which
are not contractible to the identity. Hence the gauge transformations generated by U need
not act trivially on all ﬁelds of the theory.

L xµJ) and U = exp( 2πi

In particular our argument that in the inﬁnite-volume limit the only ﬂat connection
is the trivial one, does not go through in this case without additional assumptions.
If
we wish to recover A = 0 as the unique (up to gauge transformations) solution to (3.43)
in the inﬁnite-volume limit, we must impose by hand that U = exp( 2πi
L xµJ) and U =
exp( 2πi

L xµK) act trivially on all ﬁelds of the theory.
Finally, the matter sector localizes to the following ﬁeld conﬁgurations:

FA = 0 ; ΨA = ΨA = 0 ; XA = const ,

(3.45)

where we have restricted to the contour C, cf. (3.13).

3.5 One-loop Determinant

We will now compute the one-loop determinant from the quadratic ﬂuctuations around the
following saddle points,

λ = 0 ;

Aµ = 0 ;
FA = 0 ; ΨA = ΨA = 0 ; XA = const ,

(3.46)

and similarly for ˆA, ˆλ. I.e. we will ignore the contributions from non-vanishing ﬂat gauge
connections, as discussed in the previous section.

The full path integral is of the form:

Z dϕ exp{iS + iSg.f. − t(∆Vgauge +

(3.47)

where iSg.f. is the gauge-ﬁxing action (3.32), andR dϕ stands for integrations over all ﬁelds

and ghosts; ∆Vgauge contains deformations for both hatted and unhatted gauge multiplets.

On T 3 with periodic conditions, any ﬁeld ϕ can be expanded in terms of Fourier modes:

One may worry about regularizing the numerator. However, we note that the gauge-ﬁxing

integrating out Aµ, ˆAµ, gives a Jacobian factor which cancels the numerator of (3.65).

The integral over FA simply contributes an overall constant factor. Finally we are left

(3.81) is a 2d + 8w2 by 2d + 8w2 block matrix: each entry is given by one of the above four

The matrix (3.81) can be partitioned into four blocks:

4We use the notation A, B, C, D for the matrices in the bosonic sector, while the matrices A, B, C, D

are used for the fermion ﬁelds. We hope this does not cause any confusion with the Sp(2) indices.

– 23 –

Their combined contribution to the one-loop determinant is:

{(4π2~n2)dYA
Y~n

(π2~n2)w2

} .

(3.88)

Furthermore the integrations over the ghosts and anti-ghosts for the two gauge groups

contribute (det (cid:3))2 = {Q~n(4π2~n2)d}2. When combined with (3.88) this gives:

(3.89)

{(4π2~n2)3dYA
Y~n

(π2~n2)w2

} .

Up to a constant factor, this partially cancels the one-loop determinant from the boson
sector, (3.70). We are thus left with only X 0-dependent contributions from both boson
and fermion sectors.

Inserting the localization conditions (3.46) into the oﬀ-shell Lagrangian (2.8) gives a
vanishing classical contribution. Therefore the partition function is given purely by the
one-loop determinant:

Z =Z YA Y(ρ,ˆρ)

dX 0(ρ,ˆρ)

(3.90)

We now make use of the Sylvester identity:

det[1 − D−1CA−1B] = det[1 − BD−1CA−1] ,

(3.91)

where the matrix on the left-hand side above is 32w2 × 32w2, while the matrix on the
right-hand side is 8d × 8d. Using the deﬁnitions in (3.82) and (3.83), one can show that:

det[1 − BD−1CA−1]

Putting this back into the one-loop determinant, we see that the fermion and boson deter-
minants cancel exactly against each other.

4 Discussion

We have carried out the localization procedure for the N = 1 Chern-Simons-matter theory
on T 3 with periodic boundary conditions. In particular we computed the contributions to
the partition function from the locus of saddle points with vanishing gauge connection. As
we have seen, restricting to this locus gives a trivial contribution to the partition function,
i.e. the bosonic and fermionic contributions exactly cancel each other. Of course the full
partition function a priori receives contributions also from saddle points with nonvanishing
ﬂat gauge connections, which we have not computed here. We hope to return to this in
the future.

The authors of [22] considered Euclidean 4d N = 1 theories without R-symmetry, and
concluded that no localization is possible in this case. Our results are not in contradiction
with their conclusions. Indeed it is possible to construct 3d theories without R-symmetry
by dimensional reduction and further truncation of 4d theories with R-symmetry.

Our results have the following implication for the partition function of the ABJM model
on T 3.5 Our analysis of the saddle points shows that the classical CS action vanishes on the
locus of ﬂat gauge connections on T 3, cf. (3.43). Since the one-loop determinant around
the saddle points does not introduce any dependence on the two CS levels, it follows by the
localization argument that the partition function is independent of the level k ≡ k1 = −k2.
Hence we may compute the partition function in the limit k → ∞ with N ﬁxed, which
corresponds to vanishing ’t Hooft coupling. In this limit the matter sector becomes free
and decouples from the CS action. Therefore the resulting partition function factorizes
into a pure supersymmetric CS partition function and a free matter piece. The latter is
trivial, i.e. the bosonic and fermionic contributions exactly cancel each other. Moreover
our localization results can be applied to the pure CS partition function to show that the
contribution from the saddle points with vanishing gauge connection is also trivial.

5Note that placing the ABJM model on T 3 breaks conformal invariance: this can be seen directly from
the fact that the superconformal transfromation parameter η of section B.2 is not well-deﬁned on the torus,
being linear in the coordinates.

A Spinor and gamma-matrix conventions in 3d

The charge conjugation matrix in three dimensions satisﬁes:

C T r = −C;

(Cγµ)T r = Cγµ;

C ∗ = −C −1 .

For any spinor ψ and in any spacetime signature we deﬁne:

Moreover in Euclidean signature we deﬁne:

eψ ≡ ψT rC −1 .
ψc ≡ Cψ∗ .

It follows that,

ψ† = − ˜ψc ;

(ψc)c = −ψ .

(A.1)

(A.2)

(A.3)

(A.4)

The irreducible spinor representation in three Euclidean dimensions is two-dimensional
complex (pseudoreal).

The Gamma matrices in Euclidean signature are taken to obey:

Antisymmetric products of Gamma matrices are deﬁned by:

(γµ)† = γµ .

γ(n)
µ1...µn ≡ γ[µ1 . . . γµn] .

In Euclidean signature the Hodge-dual of an antisymmetric product of gamma matrices is

n = 4(α3 − α2,2)α3 − m .

• Let us also mention that the requirement that the total Lagrangian should be real (which
we do not need to impose in the present paper) would imply the following additional
conditions on the parameters:

α2,1, α2,2, α3, α4,1, α4,2, α4,3, α4,4, m, ¯m, n are real ,

a1, a2 are imaginary ,
(a3 − i¯α1)∗ = ¯a3 + iα1 , (a4 + i¯α1)∗ = −iα1 , (i¯α1)∗ = a4 − iα1 .

(B.10)

When we combine the above reality conditions with (B.9), we see that α1 and ¯α1 are real
and a4, a3, ¯a3 are imaginary.

From the above it follows that the on-shell theory has four independent parameters

besides the CS levels k1, k2. They can be chosen to be α1, ¯α1, ¯a3 and m.

B.2 Conformal supersymmetry

Provided (B.9) holds, the action possesses an additional conformal supersymmetry. To
show this, we follow [16] and replace the parameter ǫ of the Poincar´e supersymmetry by
xµγµη, while adding to the spinor variations the terms:

δ′ΨA = ΩABX Bη ,
δ′ΨA = ΩABXBη .

(B.11)

Most terms in the Lagrangian are then invariant by virtue of the Poincar´e supersymme-
try. The term coming from the derivative acting on x of xµγµη in δ3Ψ of the fermion
kinetic Lagrangian cancels with δ′Ψ of L4, if (B.9) holds. Finally terms generated by the
remaining variations of the fermions in the fermionic kinetic terms cancel against the boson
transformations in the bosonic kinetic Lagrangian and the variations of the CS terms.

C Trivial G-structures in 3d

The existence of a nowhere-vanishing (commuting) spinor ǫ on a Riemannian three-manifold
implies the existence of a trivial G-structure, i.e. the trivialization of the tangent bundle.
In this section we will explore in detail the implications of this trivialization.

Since ǫ is assumed nowhere-vanishing we can take it to be normalized:

where we used the formulas in Appendix A. On the other hand,

ǫ†ǫ = ˜ǫǫc = − ˜ǫcǫ = 1 ,

˜ǫǫ = 0 ,

(C.1)

(C.2)

due to the antisymmetry of the charge conjugation matrix, cf. (A.1). furthermore we can
deﬁne the following ǫ-bilinear one-forms:6

Uµ ≡ ǫ†γµǫ = − ˜ǫcγµǫ = −˜ǫγµǫc ,

where we took (A.4) into account, and:

Vµ ≡ ˜ǫγµǫ .
It can be seen that U is real whereas V is complex:

¯Vµ = − ˜ǫcγµǫc = ǫ†γµǫc .

The Fierz identities can be conveniently written in terms of the bilinears above:

1
2
ǫc ˜ǫc = −
Using the above, the following relations can be shown:

(1 + U µγµ) ;

ǫ ˜ǫc = −

ǫc˜ǫ =

(1 − U µγµ)

¯V µγµ .

(C.5)

(C.6)

U 2 = ℜV 2 = ℑV 2 = 1 ; U · ℜV = U · ℑV = ℜV · ℑV = 0 ,

(C.7)
where we have deﬁned A2 ≡ AµAµ, A · B ≡ AµBµ and V = ℜV + iℑV . In other words
the triplet (U , ℜV , ℑV ) is a globally-deﬁned orthonormal frame thus trivializing the
(co)tangent bundle of the manifold.

Let us also mention the following useful identities which can similarly be shown by

ﬁerzing:

From these we also obtain:

γµǫ = Uµǫ + Vµǫc
γµǫc = ¯Vµǫ − Uµǫc .

U µγµǫ = ǫ ; U µγµǫc = −ǫc
¯V µγµǫ = ǫc
V µγµǫc = ǫ ;

V µγµǫ = ¯V µγµǫc = 0 .

(C.9)

6Since we are assuming the existence of a Riemannian metric on our manifold, we can convert vectors

to one-forms and vice-versa.

Spinor and tensor decomposition

Spinors on the manifold can be expanded on the basis of ǫ, ǫc. Explicitly, for any spinor λ
we have:

where λ± are scalar coeﬃcients given by:

λ = λ+ǫ + λ−ǫc ,

λ+ = ˜λǫc ;

λ− = ˜ǫλ .

The notation is motivated by the fact that we may deﬁne a chirality operator:

γ ≡ U µγµ ,

(C.10)

(C.11)

(C.12)

which indeed squares to one as follows from (C.7). Moreover ǫ, ǫc are chiral, antichiral
respectively with respect ot γ, as can be seen from (C.9).

Forms and tensors can be decomposed using the orthonormal frame provided by (U, V ).

For example any one-form A can be decomposed as follows:

A = A⊥U + A+V + A− ¯V ,

where A⊥, A± are scalar coeﬃcients given by:

A⊥ = U · A ; A+ =

1
2

¯V · A ; A− =

1
2

V · A .

(C.13)

(C.14)

The notation is motivated by the fact that one-forms can be decomposed into the subspaces
parallel and orthogonal to U , which we may call the vertical and horizontal subspaces
respectively. The horizontal subspace can then be further decomposed into directions
parallel and orthogonal to V (equivalently: orthogonal and parallel to ¯V ), which we may
consider as the holomorphic and antiholomorphic directions respectively.

D Lorentz Gauge

In this section we give the details of the integration over the ghost complex. First note
that in (3.32) the integration over b and b0 can be performed independently:

db(x)db0 expi R dx3tr{b(∂µAµ+b0)}

db′(x)db0 expi R dx3tr{b′(x)(∂µAµ+b0)}Z db′ expi R dx3tr{b′(∂µAµ+b0)}

db′(x) expi R dx3tr{b′(x)∂µAµ} ,

where Vol denotes the volume of T 3, and we decompose b(x) = b′(x) + b′; b′ is a constant
ﬁeld: it is the zero mode of b(x). The remaining integration over b′(x) imposes the Lorentz
gauge condition.

Next we integrate over a0, then ¯a0:

Note that the expression above is multiplied by an overall factor δ(∂ · A), therefore we can
set ∂ · A to zero and integrate over C ′:

dC ′(x)d ¯C ′(x)d ¯C0 expi R dx3tr{− ¯C ′(x)(∂µDµC ′(x)+∂µδQAµ)+C ′(x) ¯C0}

Absorbing δQAµ into C ′(x), restricting to the saddle point A = 0 and integrating over C ′
and ¯C ′, the last line gives det (cid:3).

To see that δQAµ can indeed be absorbed into C ′(x) it suﬃces to show that there is a

C ′′ such that:

∂µDµC ′(x) + ∂µδQAµ = ∂µDµC ′′ .

Equivalently in form notation:

d†(δQA + dAδC) = 0 ,

(D.5)

(D.6)

where we have set δC := C ′ − C ′′, dA := d + i[A, ]. The Hodge decompositions of δC, δQA
are as follows:

δC = δC(h) + d†δC(1) ;

δQA = δQA(h) + dδQA(0) + d†δQA(2) ,

(D.7)

– 33 –

where the numerical subscripts indicate the rank of the corresponding form and δC(h),
δQA(h) are harmonic zero-, one-forms respectively; in particular δC(h) is constant. Similarly
for the gauge ﬁeld we expand:

A = d†A(2) + A(h) .

(D.8)

The fact that there is no exact piece in the decomposition above is due to the Lorentz
gauge, d†A = 0. Furthermore equation (D.6) is equivalent to the statement that there
exist a two-form u and a harmonic one-form wh such that:

dAδC + δQA = d†u + w(h) .

(D.9)

On the other hand, taking the expansions (D.7),(D.8) into account, the left-hand side of
(D.6) reads:

d(δC + δQA(0)) + id†([A(2), δC] + [A(h), δC(1)]) + i[A(h), δC(h)] .

(D.10)

It follows that (D.9), is solved for:

δC = −δQA(0) ;

u = i([A(2), δC] + [A(h), δC(1)]) ; w(h) = i[A(h), δC(h)] .
