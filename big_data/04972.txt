Representable posets

Rob Egrot

Abstract

A poset is representable if it can be embedded in a ﬁeld of sets in such
a way that existing ﬁnite meets and joins become intersections and unions
respectively (we say ﬁnite meets and joins are preserved). More generally,
for cardinals α and β a poset is said to be (α, β)-representable if an embed-
ding into a ﬁeld of sets exists that preserves meets of sets smaller than α
and joins of sets smaller than β. We show using an ultraproduct/ultraroot
argument that when 2 ≤ α, β ≤ ω the class of (α, β)-representable posets
is elementary, but does not have a ﬁnite axiomatization in the case where
either α or β = ω. We also show that the classes of posets with represen-
tations preserving either countable or all meets and joins are pseudoele-
mentary.

1 Introduction

Every poset P can be thought of as a set of sets ordered by inclusion by con-
sidering the embedding P → ℘(P ) deﬁned by p 7→ {q ∈ P : q ≤ p}. Indeed,
this representation has the advantage of preserving all existing meets, ﬁnite and
inﬁnite. Similarly the representation deﬁned by p 7→ {q ∈ P : q 6≥ p} preserves
existing joins [1]. It follows from this that semilattices can be represented in
such a way that their binary operation is modelled by union or intersection ap-
propriately, though in general we cannot construct representations where both
existing joins and meets are interpreted as unions and intersections respectively.
Distributivity, or the lack of it, is the issue here, as might be expected given
that ﬁelds of sets are distributive. In the case of Boolean algebras, which are
necessarily distributive, representability follows as an easy corollary of Stone’s
theorem [14]. For lattices distributivity alone is a necessary and suﬃcient con-
dition for representability.

Deﬁnition 1.1 (Lattice representation). Let L be a bounded lattice. A rep-
resentation of L is a bounded lattice embedding h : L → ℘(X) for some set X,
where ℘(X) is considered as a ﬁeld of sets, under the operations of set union and
intersection. When such a representation exists we say that L is representable.

Theorem 1.2 (Birkhoﬀ). Let L be a distributive lattice, let F be a ﬁlter of L,
and let I be an ideal of L with F ∩ I = ∅. Then there is a prime ﬁlter F ′ ⊂ L
with F ⊆ F ′ and I ∩ F ′ = ∅.

As a corollary to this we have the following result.

Theorem 1.3. A bounded lattice is representable if and only if it is distributive.

Proof. If L is a distributive lattice and K is the set of prime ﬁlters of L it’s not
diﬃcult to show that the map h : P → ℘(K) deﬁned by h(a) = {f ∈ K : a ∈ f }
is a representation using theorem 1.2. The converse is trivial.

In the meet-semilattice case we have representability for existing ﬁnite joins
if and only if an inﬁnite family of ﬁrst order axioms demanding that whenever
a ∧ (b1 ∨ ... ∨ bn) is deﬁned, then (a ∧ b1) ∨ ... ∨ (a ∧ bn) is also deﬁned and
the two are equal is satisﬁed [3, 11]. In the lattice case of course only a single
distributivity equation is both necessary and suﬃcient. It is possible that in
the meet-semilattice case meets could distribute over some ﬁnite cardinalities
of existing joins but not others, which would necessitate a family of axioms to
axiomatize representability. Schein [11] asserts that this is the case, and indeed
that an inﬁnite family is required, but there is some reason to doubt that this
has been established as a fact. We expand on this in the discussion following
corollary 2.9.

It is tempting to try to apply the meet-semilattice axiom schema directly
to posets. There is a problem however, as the classical Zorn’s lemma based
argument for semilattices and lattices does not work in the poset case. A step
in this argument assumes the existence of ﬁnite meets, which is invalid in the
more general setting of posets. This is a symptom of a deeper problem, as a
simple generalization of the axiom schema for semilattices (such as appears as
the condition LMD in [5], see deﬁnition 1.4 below) is not expressive enough
for the poset situation (see example 1.5, where it is shown that LMD is not a
necessary condition for a poset to have a representation). Note that the question
of whether LMD is a suﬃcient condition for representability with respect to all
meets and binary joins is raised as open in [5], and appears not to have been
resolved.

Deﬁnition 1.4 (LMD). A poset P is LM D if and only if, for all x, y, z ∈ P ,
whenever x ∧ (y ∨ z) is deﬁned then (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) is also deﬁned and they are
equal.

Example 1.5 (The condition LM D is not necessary for representability). Let
P be the poset

p ∧ (q ∨ r)

Then p ∧ q, p ∧ r, and (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r) do not exist in P but P is representable.
For example using the ﬁeld of sets generated by {a, c, d}, {b, d}, {b, c}, where
p 7→ {a, c, d}, q 7→ {b, d} and r 7→ {b, c}.

Suppose we were to weaken LM D so that equality is only necessary in the
case where both sides are deﬁned (see deﬁnition 1.6 below)? It turns out that
an axiom schema along these lines is not suﬃcient to ensure representability.
We will demonstrate this in example 2.13 later.

Deﬁnition 1.6 ( ¯D2). We say a poset P satisﬁes condition ¯D2 if and only if
for all x, y, z ∈ P , whenever x ∧ (y ∨ z) and (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) are deﬁned then
they are equal.

Despite the failure of the most natural candidates, it is nevertheless the
case that the class of representable posets is elementary, though an inﬁnite
number of axioms are needed. In section 2 we set down a general framework for
representations of posets and prove a characterization theorem (theorem 2.7). In
section 3 we provide some well known deﬁnitions and results from model theory
which we shall use in later sections. In section 4 we use this characterization in a
closure under ultraproducts/ultraroots argument to demonstrate that the class
of representable posets is elementary. We also show that an inﬁnite number of
axioms is necessary. Finally in section 5 we show that the notion of complete
representability introduced in section 2 is pseudoelementary, and describe some
situations where it is known not be elementary.

2 Representations for posets

In the following deﬁnitions we assume that α and β are cardinals with 2 < α, β.
We observe the following notational convention. For any subset S of a poset
P we write S↑ for {p ∈ P : ∃s ∈ S, s ≤ p}. For p ∈ P we write p↑ as shorthand
for {p}↑ when the meaning is not ambiguous.

Deﬁnition 2.1 ((α, β)-morphism). Given posets P1 and P2 we say a map
f : P1 → P2 is an (α, β)-morphism if f (VI pi) = VI f (pi) whenever |I| < α
and VI pi is deﬁned, and f (WI pi) = WI f (pi) whenever |I| < β and WI pi is
deﬁned. If f is also an order embedding we say it is an (α, β)-embedding (note
that f will always be order preserving).

If for some α a morphism f is an (α, β)-morphism for all β we say it is an
(α, C)-morphism, and similarly if for some β it is an (α, β)-morphism for all
α we say it is a (C, β)-morphism. If f is an (α, β)-morphism for all α, β then
we say it is a C-morphism, or a complete morphism. We make the appropriate
deﬁnitions for complete embeddings etc. When α = β we just say e.g. α-
morphism.

Deﬁnition 2.2 ((α, β)-representation). An (α, β)-representation of a poset P
is an (α, β)-embedding h : P → ℘(X) for some set X where ℘(X) is considered
as a ﬁeld of sets. When P has a top and/or bottom, we demand that h maps

3

them to X and/or ∅ respectively. When P has an (ω, ω)-representation we omit
the modiﬁer and simply say it has a representation, or that it is representable.
Similar deﬁnitions are made for complete representations etc. using deﬁnition
2.1 above. When α = β we just say e.g. α-representation.

The concept of representability is equivalent to a separation property. We
make this precise in theorem 2.7, though ﬁrst we require some preliminary
deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 2.3 ((α, β)-ﬁlter). S ⊆ P is an (α, β)-ﬁlter of P if it is closed
upwards and for all ∅ ⊂ X ⊆ S with |X| < α we have V X ∈ S whenever V X
is deﬁned, and whenever ∅ ⊂ Y ⊆ P and |Y | < β with W Y deﬁned in P we have
W Y ∈ S =⇒ y ∈ S for some y ∈ Y . (C, C)-ﬁlters etc. are deﬁned similarly.
When α = β we just say e.g. α-ﬁlter.

We deﬁne (α, β)-ideals dually as being the sets that are (α, β)-ﬁlters in the
order dual P δ. Note that in a lattice the (α, β)-ﬁlters and (α, β)-ideals are
precisely the prime ﬁlters and prime ideals (for all 2 < α, β ≤ ω).

Proposition 2.4. If F is an (α, β)-ﬁlter of P then F ′ = P \ F is a (β, α)-ideal
of P .

Proof. We must show that F ′ is a (β, α)-ﬁlter of P δ. Clearly F ′ is up-closed in
P δ so let X ⊆ F ′ with |X| < β and suppose V X exists in P δ. Then if V X /∈ F ′
(in P δ) then W X ∈ F (in P ), and so we must have x ∈ X ∩ F , which would be
a contradiction. Similarly, suppose Y ⊂ P δ with |Y | < α and that W Y exists
in P δ. Then if for all y ∈ Y we have y /∈ F ′ then we must have Y ⊆ F . But
then V Y ∈ F (in P ), and so W Y /∈ F ′ (in P δ). So F ′ is a (β, α)-ﬁlter of P δ as
required.

Corollary 2.5. F is an (α, β)-ﬁlter of P ⇐⇒ F ′ is a (β, α)-ideal of P

Proof. The forward direction is the preceding proposition, and the backward
direction follows from the dual statement.

Deﬁnition 2.6 (Separating). S ⊆ ℘(P ) is separating over P if whenever p 6≤
q ∈ P there is X ∈ S with p ∈ X and q /∈ X. We say S is dually-separating
over P if whenever p 6≤ q there is X ∈ S with q ∈ X and p /∈ X.

Theorem 2.7. For a poset P , and for all cardinals 2 < α, β the following are
equivalent:

1. The (α, β)-ﬁlters of P are separating over P ,

2. P is (α, β)-representable,

Proof.

4

1. ⇒ 2. Let F be the set of (α, β)-ﬁlters of P and deﬁne h by h(p) = {γ ∈
F : p ∈ γ}. If F is separating over P then h will certainly be an order
embedding. Moreover, if X ⊆ P with |X| < α and V X deﬁned in P then
clearly h(V X) ⊆ T h[X] and if there is an (α, β)-ﬁlter γ with x ∈ γ for
all x ∈ X then V X ∈ γ too, so h(V X) = T h[X]. Similarly, if Y ⊆ P
with |Y | < β and W Y deﬁned in P , then clearly h(W Y ) ⊇ S h[Y ], and
if there is an (α, β)-ﬁlter γ with W Y ∈ γ then there must be y ∈ Y with
y ∈ γ so h(W Y ) = S h[Y ].
2. ⇒ 1. Let h : P → ℘(X) be an (α, β)−representation and let a 6≤ b ∈ P .
Then there is x ∈ X with x ∈ h(a) and x /∈ h(b). Consider h−1[x] = {p ∈
P : x ∈ h(p)}. Then clearly a ∈ h−1[x] and b /∈ h−1[x]. We will show
that h−1[x] is an (α, β)-ﬁlter. If p ∈ h−1[x] and q ≥ p then q ∈ h−1[x]
as h(p) ⊆ h(q) so h−1[x] is up-closed. Let S ⊆ h−1[x] with |S| < α
and suppose V S is deﬁned in P . By deﬁnition we have x ∈ h(s) for all
s ∈ S, so x ∈ T h[S] = h(V S), and thus V S ∈ h−1[x]. Similarly, if
S ⊆ P with |S| < β and W S deﬁned and in h−1[x] then by deﬁnition
x ∈ h(W S) = S h[S] so x ∈ h(s) for some s ∈ S and thus s ∈ h−1[x] for
some s ∈ S. So h−1[x] is an (α, β)-ﬁlter and we are done.

There is of course a dual version of this theorem with ideals in place of ﬁlters.
There are also versions of this result for (C, β), (α, C) and C-ﬁlters obtainable
by simply substituting C consistently. The proofs are essentially the same.

Corollary 2.8. When α, β ≤ ω a poset P is (α, β)-representable if and only if
there is a distributive lattice L and an (α, β)-embedding e : P → L.

Proof. If P is representable then the representation provides a suitable dis-
tributive lattice. Conversely, if L is a distributive lattice and e : P → L is an
(α, β)-embedding then, by theorem 1.2, whenever p 6≤ q in P there is a prime
ﬁlter of L containing e(p) but not e(q). The preimage of this ﬁlter under e is
an (α, β)-ﬁlter so the (α, β)-ﬁlters of P are separating over P and thus P is
representable.

Corollary 2.9. For a poset P the following are equivalent:

1. P is completely representable.

2. There is a complete lattice L with the following properties:

(a) the completely join-irreducibles of L are join-dense in L,
(b) L satisﬁes the distributivity property that p ∧ W X = WX {p ∧ x} for

all {p} ∪ X ⊆ L,

(c) there is a complete embedding e : P → L.

3. There is a complete lattice L with the following properties:

5

(a) the completely meet-irreducibles of L are meet-dense in L,
(b) L satisﬁes the distributivity property that p ∨ V X = VX {p ∨ x} for

all {p} ∪ X ⊆ L,

(c) there is a complete embedding e : P → L.

Proof. We prove 1. ⇐⇒ 2. and the rest follows from order duality. The forward
direction is trivial. For the converse note that by the distributivity property of
L if p ∈ L is completely join-irreducible then it also has the property that
whenever p ≤ W X there must be x ∈ X with p ≤ x (this property is usually
known as complete join-primality). Thus the completely join-irreducibles of L
generate a separating set of C-ﬁlters in L, and the preimages of these under e
is a separating set of C-ﬁlters of P .

Remark 2.10. In the preceding result note that 2(a) and 2(b) together imply
not only that L is an algebraic frame, but also that it is a co-algebraic co-frame.
In fact, it follows from theorem 2.7 that L is completely representable, and
thus that it is completely distributive. Moreover, since L is complete, complete
representability also implies that the completely meet-prime elements are meet-
dense in L. So any complete lattice satisfying 2(a) and 2(b) will not only satisfy
3(a) and 3(b) (and vice versa by duality), but also the superﬁcially stronger
condition of being completely distributive, join-generated by its completely join-
primes, and meet-generated by its completely meet-primes.

If α ≤ α′ and β ≤ β′ then the fact that P is (α, β)-representable whenever
it is (α′, β′)-representable comes straight from the deﬁnition. The converse
however is not true in general, as we see in examples 2.11 and 2.12 below. Note
that [11] claims implicitly that meet-semilattices can be constructed where the
partial join operation is m-representable but not n-representable (with m < n ≤
ω), but does not provide one. Many years later the existence of such semilattices
was raised as an open question at the end of [10]. It is shown in [13] that any
such semilattice example cannot be ﬁnite. An earlier paper [9] had claimed that
no such semilattice could exist, and thus that for semilattices n-representability
implies ω-representability for all n < ω. However, the MathSciNet review of
this article notes that the paper makes essential use of the original, slightly
erroneous form of [3, theorem 2.2], and hence the result is not considered to be
correct. A corrected version of [3, theorem 2.2] can be found as [8, theorem 2.2].

Then no non-trivial binary joins are deﬁned in P , so we can ﬁnd a 3-representation
for P by taking the principal up-sets and appealing to theorem 2.7. However,
there is no 4-ﬁlter containing p but not q, so by the same theorem P has no
4-representation.

Following the suggestion of the referee we generalize example 2.11 to ﬁnd
posets that are (n−1)-representable but not n-representable for arbitrary n < ω.

Example 2.12 (A poset that is (n − 1)-representable but not n-representable).
Let X = {x1, ..., xn} be a set with |X| = n. For every s ⊂ X with |s| = n − 2
deﬁne a new element ys. Let Y be the set of all the ys elements. Let p and
q not occur in either X or Y . We deﬁne Pn by extending the trivial order on
X ∪ Y ∪ {p, q} as follows:

1. q < x for all x ∈ X

2. p > x for all x ∈ X

3. ys > x ⇐⇒ x ∈ s

and closing for transitivity. Then Pn is m-representable for all m < n because
there are no non-trivial joins of cardinality less than or equal to m − 1 deﬁned
in P . To see this let t ⊂ X with 2 ≤ |t| < m and deﬁne St = {s ⊂ X : t ⊆ s
and |s| = n − 2}. Then the upper bounds of t are {ys : s ∈ St} ∪ {p}, and this
set is an antichain. So we can once again take the set of principal up-sets and
appeal to theorem 2.7. However, p is the only upper bound for X \ {x1}, so any
n-ﬁlter containing p must also contain x for some x ∈ X \ {x1}. Similarly any
such n-ﬁlter must also contain x′ for some x′ ∈ X \ {x}, and the meet of x and
x′ is q. So there can be no n-ﬁlter containing p but not q and thus Pn cannot
be n-representable.

Note that the posets in example 2.12 are actually (α, (n − 1))-representable

but not (α, n)-representable for all α > 2.

The following example demonstrates that a weaker axiom schema along the

lines of ¯D2 from deﬁnition 1.6 is not suﬃcient for our needs.

Example 2.13 (A poset satisfying ¯D2 that fails to be 3-representable). Let P
be the poset in the diagram below. Then there is no 3-ﬁlter containing p but not
q.

We must show that P satisﬁes ¯D2. We shall show that for all possible choices
of x, y, z ∈ P , either one or both of x ∧ (y ∨ z) and (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) is undeﬁned
or they are equal. To this end we will use the fact (easily checkable) that in
any poset if x, y, z satisfy any of the following conditions then ¯D2 holds for that
particular choice of x, y, z:

1. x ≤ y or x ≤ z

2. y ≤ x and z ≤ x

3. y ≤ z or z ≤ y

Now we show that there is no element of P that makes a suitable choice for x
in a counterexample to ¯D2:

x 6= ⊤. This follows directly from 2.

x 6= ⊥1 (and x 6= ⊥2 by symmetry). If x = ⊥1 then in order for x ∧ y to
be deﬁned we must have x ≤ y and so we apply 1.

x 6= q. If x = q then in order for x ∧ y to be (non-trivially) deﬁned we
must have one of y = a, b, ⊥1, or ⊥2. Similar considerations apply to z
and so by 3 we must have (wlog) y = a or ⊥1, and z = b or ⊥2. But then
x ∧ y = ⊥1 and x ∧ z = ⊥2 and so (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) is undeﬁned.

x 6= a (and x 6= b by symmetry). If x = a then in order for x ∧ y to be
(non-trivially) deﬁned we must have one of y = ⊥1, q, p, or ⊤. We can
rule out y = ⊤ with 1, and if y = ⊥1 then if x ∧ z is deﬁned we will have
y ≤ z and we would apply 3. So we must have either y = p or q. Similar
considerations apply to z and so wlog suppose y = p and z = q. Then y ∨ z
is not deﬁned and we are done.

8

x 6= p. If x = p then in order for x ∧ y to be (non-trivially) deﬁned we
must have one of y = ⊥1, ⊥2, a, b, or ⊤. By 1 we can exclude y = ⊤ and
so applying 3 suppose wlog that y = a or ⊥1, and z = b or ⊥2. But then
as in the case where x = q we conclude that (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z) is not deﬁned.

To close this section recall theorem 1.2, and the similar result for semilattices
[3, theorem 2.2],[8, theorem 2.2]. An obvious question is whether analogous
results hold for representable posets. For example, if P is 3-representable, p ∈ P ,
and γ is an up-closed subset of P closed under existing binary meets with p /∈ γ,
can γ always be extended to a 3-ﬁlter of P that excludes p? The answer turns
out to be no, as we see in example 2.14 below.

Example 2.14. Consider the following system of sets P :
{y, x1} {x1, x2} {x2, x3} {x3, x4} {x4, y}

{x2}

{x3}

{x1, x4}

{x1}

{x4}

Then P is (completely) represented by itself. Moreover,

γ = {{y, x1}, {x2, x3}, {x4, y}}

is an up-closed set that is closed under existing binary meets and does not contain
{x1, x4}. However, every 3-ﬁlter of P that contains γ must contain {x1, x4}.

3 Ultraproducts and ultraroots

This section serves to introduce the aspects of model theory on which we base
the results of the following sections.

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Ultraproduct). Given a language L , an indexing set I 6= ∅,
a set of L -structures {Ai : i ∈ I}, and an ultraﬁlter U ⊂ ℘(I), we deﬁne an
equivalence relation ∼ on QI
Ai by x ∼ y ⇐⇒ {i ∈ I : x(i) = y(i)} ∈ U .
We deﬁne the ultraproduct of {Ai : i ∈ I} over U to be the set of ∼ equivalence
classes of QI
Ai as an L -
structure by making interpretations as follows:

Ai and we denote it with QU

Ai. We can use QU

• QU

Ai |= R([x1], ..., [xn]) ⇐⇒ {i ∈ I : Ai |= Ri(x1(i), ..., xn(i))} ∈ U for
all n-ary relation symbols R of L , where Ri is the interpretation of that
relation in Ai.

• f ([x1], ..., [xn]) = [(fi(x1(i), ..., xn(i)))I ] for all n-ary function symbols f of

L , where fi is the interpretation of that function in Ai and (fi(x1(i), ..., xn(i)))I
is the element of QI
i ∈ I.

Ai obtained by applying fi to (x1(i), ..., xn(i)) for each

• c = [¯c], where ¯c(i) is the interpretation of c in Ai for all i ∈ I for all

constant symbols c of L .

A.

A.

It’s easy to check that this interpretation deﬁnes an L -structure (see e.g.
Proposition 4.1.7]). When Ai = Aj = A for all i, j ∈ I we say QU
ultrapower of A over U , and we write QU
ultraroot of QU
Theorem 3.2 ( Lo´s). Let L be a language, let φ be an L -sentence, let I 6= ∅
be an indexing set, let {Ai : i ∈ I} be a set of L -structures, and let U be an
ultraﬁlter of ℘(I). Then QU

[4,
Ai is the
In this case we say A is an

Ai |= φ ⇐⇒ {i ∈ I : Ai |= φ} ∈ U .

Theorem 3.2 is sometimes referred as the fundamental theorem of ultraprod-
[4, Theorem 4.1.9] for a proof). It allows axiomatization results
In particular we shall use the

ucts (see e.g.
to be proved with largely algebraic methods.
following theorem based on the deep results of Shelah [12].

Theorem 3.3. ([7, Theorem 3.32]). Given a language L and a class C of L -
structures, C is elementary if and only if C is closed under taking isomorphic
copies, ultraproducts, and ultraroots.

4 Elementary classes of representable posets

In this section 2 < α, β ≤ ω. The results do not necessarily hold for larger
values.

Lemma 4.1. Let I be an indexing set, let Pi be a poset for each i ∈ I, let U be
an ultraﬁlter of ℘(I), and let u ∈ U . Then if γi is an (α, β)-ﬁlter of Pi for each
i ∈ u then Γ = {[x] ∈ QU Pi : {i : x(i) ∈ γi} ∈ U } is an (α, β)-ﬁlter of QU Pi.
Proof. Let [x] ∈ Γ, and let [y] ≥ [x]. Then let u1 = {i : x(i) ∈ γi} ∈ U , and
u2 = {i : y(i) ≥ x(i)} ∈ U , so {i : y(i) ∈ γi} ⊇ u1 ∩ u2 ∈ U and thus [y] ∈ Γ. So
Γ is up-closed.

Now let [x], [y] ∈ Γ. A similar argument to the above proves that [x]∧[y] ∈ Γ.

This argument generalizes to arbitrary ﬁnite meets.

Finally let [x] ∨ [y] ∈ Γ, and let v = {i : x(i) ∨ y(i) ∈ γi} ∈ U . Let
u1 = {i : x(i) ∈ γi}, and u2 = {i : y(i) ∈ γi}. Then u1 ∪ u2 = v and so either
u1 ∈ U or u2 ∈ U . Thus either [x] ∈ Γ or [y] ∈ Γ. This argument generalizes to
arbitrary ﬁnite joins, and so we conclude that Γ is an (α, β)-ﬁlter.

Proposition 4.2. The class of (α, β)-representable posets is closed under ul-
traproducts.

Proof. Let I be an indexing set, let Pi be an (α, β)-representable poset for each
i ∈ I, let [a], [b] ∈ QU Pi and let [a] 6≤ [b]. Let u = {i : a(i) 6≤ b(i)} ∈ U . Since
Pi is (α, β)-representable for each i ∈ u there is an (α, β)-ﬁlter γi with a(i) ∈ γi
and b(i) /∈ γi. By lemma 4.1 Γ = {[x] ∈ QU Pi : {i : x(i) ∈ γi} ∈ U } is an
(α, β)-ﬁlter of QU Pi, and clearly [a] ∈ Γ. Since {i : b(i) 6∈ γi} = u ∈ U we also
have [y] 6∈ Γ so we are done.

Lemma 4.3. Let P be a poset, let I be an indexing set, let U be an ultraﬁlter
of ℘(I), and let Γ be an (α, β)-ﬁlter of QU P . Given p ∈ P deﬁne ¯p ∈ QI P by
¯p(i) = p for all i ∈ I. Then γ = {p ∈ P : [¯p] ∈ Γ} is an (α, β)-ﬁlter of P .

Proof. Let p ∈ P . Then p ∈ γ ⇐⇒ [¯p] ∈ Γ. Suppose p ∈ γ and let q ≥ p.
Then clearly [¯q] ≥ [¯p] and so [¯q] ∈ Γ. This means q ∈ γ by deﬁnition and so γ
is up-closed.

Now suppose p, q ∈ γ and that p ∧ q exists in P . Then [¯p], [¯q] ∈ Γ, and so
[ ¯p ∧ q] ∈ Γ which means p ∧ q ∈ γ. This argument generalizes to arbitrary ﬁnite
meets, and a similar argument applies to joins and so γ is an (α, β)-ﬁlter.

Proposition 4.4. The class of (α, β)-representable posets is closed under ul-
traroots.

Proof. Suppose QU P is (α, β)-representable and let p, q ∈ P with p 6≤ q. Then
there is an (α, β)-ﬁlter Γ of QU P with [¯p] ∈ Γ and [¯q] 6∈ Γ. So by lemma 4.3 γ is
an (α, β)-ﬁlter of P with p ∈ γ and q 6∈ γ and thus P is (α, β)-representable.

Theorem 4.5. If α, β ≤ ω then the class of (α, β)-representable posets is ele-
mentary.

Proof. We’ve shown the class is closed under ultraproducts and ultraroots, and
closure under isomorphism is trivial, so theorem 3.3 applies.

Following the suggestion of the referee we use example 2.12 to show that the

class of representable posets is not ﬁnitely axiomatizable.

Theorem 4.6. If α, β ≤ ω and either α = ω or β = ω then the class of
(α, β)-representable posets is not ﬁnitely axiomatizable.

Proof. Assume β = ω and note that a class is basic elementary if and only if
both it and its complement are elementary. For each 4 ≤ n < ω let Pn be
a poset as in example 2.12, let U be a non-principal ultraﬁlter of ℘(ω) and
consider QU Pn. For 2 ≤ k < ω let φk be a ﬁrst order sentence equivalent to
there being no non-trivial suprema of size less than or equal to |k| deﬁned in
P . Then Pn |= φk whenever k ≤ n − 2. So QU Pn |= φk for all k, and hence
is representable by taking principal up-sets. So the complement of the class of
(α, ω)-representable posets is not closed under ultraproducts and is therefore
not elementary by theorem 3.3. Thus the class of (α, ω)-representable posets is
not ﬁnitely axiomatizable. The argument for (ω, β) is dual.

Note that it is not known whether the classes of (α, β)-representable posets
are ﬁnitely axiomatizable when 2 < α, β < ω. This is equivalent to their
complement classes being closed under ultraproducts.

5 Complete representations for posets

In section 4 we proved indirectly that when α, β ≤ ω the representation classes
for (α, β) are elementary. The proof used does not generalize to the cases when
one or both of α and β are greater than ω. Indeed, given that ﬁrst order logic
is not expressive enough to distinguish between the cardinalities of inﬁnite sets
it should not be surprising that we cannot say very much about the situations
where α and/or β are larger than ω.

Note that for some classes of posets complete representability can be ax-
iomatized in ﬁrst order logic. Boolean algebras, for example, are completely
representable if and only if they are atomic [7, theorem 2.21], [2, corollary 1].
Since all Boolean algebras are representable, any non-atomic Boolean algebra
serves as an example of a poset that is representable but not completely repre-
sentable.

Theorem 5.1 below, which also appears as [6, theorem 3.2], shows that the
extra structure of Boolean algebras is necessary here as the class of completely
representable posets (distributive lattices to be exact) is not closed under ele-
mentary equivalence and hence cannot be elementary. It is conjectured in [6]
that the classes of (ω, C) and (C, ω)-representable distributive lattices are not el-
ementary. We conjecture here that the classes of (α, C) and (C, β)-representable
posets are not elementary for all α, β ≥ 3.

Theorem 5.1. The class of completely representable posets is not closed under
elementary equivalence.

Proof. The lattice L = [0, 1] ⊆ R is not completely representable (it contains
no non-trivial C-ﬁlters), however the lattice L′ = [0, 1] ∩ Q is completely repre-
sentable as for every irrational r the set {a ∈ L′ : a > r} is a C-ﬁlter. L and L′
are elementarily equivalent as R and Q are.

The situation seems somewhat negative at this point, but we can say some-
thing positive about the various classes of completely representable posets pro-
vided we relax our criteria a little. We use arguments adapted from those for
distributive lattices given in [6, section 3].

Deﬁnition 5.2 (Pseudoelementary class). A class C of L -structures is pseu-
doelementary if there is a language L ′ with L ⊆ L ′, and an L ′-theory τ such
that C is the class of all L -reducts of the class of all models of τ .

Proposition 5.3. A class C of L -structures is pseudoelementary if and only
if there are

1. a two-sorted language L +, with disjoint sorts A and S, containing A-

sorted copies of all symbols of L , and

2. an L + theory τ

with C = {AA ↾L : A |= τ }, where A is an L +-structure, AA is the structure in
the sublanguage of L + containing only A-sorted symbols whose domain contains

12

the A-sorted elements of A, and AA ↾L is the L reduct of AA obtained by
identifying the symbols of L with their A-sorted counterparts in L +.

Proposition 5.3 follows from [7, Proposition 9.9] and the discussion at the
start of [7, Chapter 9.4.3]. We are now in a position to prove the main results
of this section.

Theorem 5.4. Let β ≤ ω. Then the class of (C, β)-representable posets is
pseudoelementary.

To prove this we proceed as follows (note that the case where β = 2 is trivial
so we assume 2 < β). Deﬁne L to be the language of posets in ﬁrst order logic,
so L = {≤}, and deﬁne L + to be the two-sorted language {≤, ∈, small}, with
sorts A and S, and ≤ and ∈ being binary and small being unary. In L + the
ﬁrst argument of ∈ is A sorted and the second is S sorted, while ≤ takes both
its arguments from A, and small takes its argument from S. Deﬁne additional
predicates as follows:

• ⊆ (s S, t S) ⇐⇒ ∀a A((a A ∈ s S) → (a A ∈ t S))
• glb(a A, s S) ⇐⇒ (cid:16)∀b A(cid:0)(b A ∈ s S) → (a A ≤ b A)(cid:1) ∧ ∀c A(cid:0)∀d A((d A ∈ s S) →
(c A ≤ d A)) → (c A ≤ a A)(cid:1)(cid:17)
• lub(a A, s S) ⇐⇒ (cid:16)∀b A(cid:0)(b A ∈ s S) → (b A ≤ a A)(cid:1) ∧ ∀c A(cid:0)∀d A((d A ∈ s S) →
(d A ≤ c A)) → (a A ≤ c A)(cid:1)(cid:17)
• U(s S) ⇐⇒ ∀a Ab A(cid:16)(cid:0)(a A ∈ s S) ∧ (a A ≤ b A)(cid:1) → (b A ∈ s S)(cid:17)
• C(s S) ⇐⇒ ∀t Sa A(cid:16)(cid:0)(t S ⊆ s S) ∧ glb(a A, t S)(cid:1) → (a A ∈ s S)(cid:17)
• A(s S) ⇐⇒ ∀t Sa A(cid:16)(cid:0)small(t S) ∧ lub(a A, t S) ∧ (a A ∈ s S)(cid:1) → ∃b A(cid:0)(b A ∈
t S) ∧ (b A ∈ s S)(cid:1)(cid:17)

So ⊆ corresponds to set inclusion, glb and lub to the concepts of greatest lower
bound and least upper bound respectively, lub corresponds to the idea of a
non-empty up-closed set, and C and A will deﬁne certain completeness and
primality properties respectively. We aim to deﬁne a theory so that we can
capture the concept of a (C, β)-ﬁlter using these predicates.

Let T be the L theory deﬁning partially ordered sets and deﬁne an L +

extension T + of T by adding the following axioms:
1 : ∀a Ab A(cid:16)(a A 6≤ b A) → ∃s S(cid:0)U(s S) ∧ C(s S) ∧ A(s S) ∧ (a A ∈ s S) ∧ (b A /∈ s S)(cid:1)(cid:17)
T +
2 : ∀a A∃s S∀b A(cid:16)(a A < b A) ↔ (b A ∈ s S)(cid:17)
T +

Note that here < is deﬁned using ≤ and means strictly less than.

13

3 : ∀s St S∃u S∀a A(cid:16)(cid:0)(a A ∈ s S) ∧ (a A ∈ t S)(cid:1) ↔ (a A ∈ u S)(cid:17)
T +

And also adding for each 2 ≤ n < β the axiom deﬁned by

Sn: ∀aA

1 ...∀aA

b A))(cid:1).

i=1(aA

i ∈ s S) ∧ small(s S) ∧ ∀b A(b A ∈ s S → Wn

i=1(aA

i =

The ﬁrst of these axioms forces its models to be separated by up-sets with the
limited completeness and primality properties deﬁned by C and A. The set
{Sn : n < β} together demand that the small predicate ‘sees’ all the sets
it’s supposed to, i.e. whenever an appropriately sized set of A sorted elements
exists it deﬁnes a corresponding S sorted object. The role of T +
3 is to
ensure that in models of T + suﬃcient S sorted elements are present to guarantee
separation by (C, β)-ﬁlters. This is made precise in the following lemma.

2 and T +

Lemma 5.5. The class {M A ↾L : M |= T +} of L -reducts of models of T + is
precisely the class of (C, β)-representable posets.

Proof. If P is a (C, β)-representable poset we can use (P, ℘(P ), ≤, ∈, small) to
model T + by the generalized version of theorem 2.7 (small holds of a set X if
and only if |X| < β). Conversely if A = M A ↾L for some model M of T + then
it is clearly a poset and by T +
1 the interpretation of the ∈ predicate can be used
to naturally deﬁne a separating set K of up-sets of A for which conditions C
and A hold. Moreover, if Z ∈ K, Y ⊆ A and |Y | < β, then A together with the
Sn axioms imply that if W Y exists in A and W Y ∈ Z then there is y ∈ Y ∩ Z.
So to complete the proof let S ∈ K, let T ⊆ S, and suppose x = V T exists in
A.
If x = V({y ∈ A : y > x}) then one of two things must occur. First
In this case x = V T ≥ z for all
we may have T ⊆ {y ∈ A : y > x} ∩ S.
lower bounds z of {y ∈ A : y > x} ∩ S. Moreover, x is a lower bound for
{y ∈ A : y > x} ∩ S, so x = V({y ∈ A : y > x} ∩ S). By axioms T +
2 and
T +
3 , and the deﬁnitions of the set K and the predicate C we must have x ∈ S.
Alternatively, if T 6⊆ {y ∈ A : y > x} ∩ S then x ∈ T , and thus in x ∈ S and we
are done.

Suppose instead that x 6= V({y ∈ A : y > x}) and x /∈ T . Then T ⊆ {y ∈
A : y > x}. As x is clearly a lower bound for {y ∈ A : y > x} if it is not the
greatest lower bound there must be z ∈ A with z ≤ y for all y > x but z 6≤ x,
but then if z would also be a lower bound for T , which would contradict the
assumption that x = V T . We conclude that S is a (C, β)-ﬁlter, and in light of
theorem 2.7 that A is a (C, β)-representable poset.

Lemma 5.5 along with proposition 5.3 concludes the proof of theorem 5.4.

A dual argument gives the following result.

Theorem 5.6. Let α ≤ ω. Then the class of (α, C)-representable posets is
pseudoelementary.

Finally, by replacing the predicate A with

¯C(s S) ⇐⇒ ∀t Sa A(cid:16)(cid:0)(t S ⊆ s S) ∧ lub(a A, t S)(cid:1) → (a A ∈ s S)(cid:17)

14

and proceeding with a similar argument replacing T +

1 with
1 : ∀a Ab A(cid:16)(a A 6≤ b A) → ∃s S(cid:0)U(s S) ∧ C(s S)
¯T +

∧ (a A ∈ s S) ∧ (b A /∈ s S)
∧ ∃t S(∀c A(c A /∈ s S ↔ c A ∈ t S) ∧ ¯C(t S))(cid:1)(cid:17)

and adding the single axiom

4 : ∀a A∃s S∀b A(cid:16)(a A > b A) ↔ (b A ∈ s S)(cid:17)
T +

in place of the Sn axioms we can prove our ﬁnal result.

Theorem 5.7. The class of completely representable posets is pseudoelemen-
tary.

Proof. The argument is essentially the same as that for theorem 5.4. The main
diﬀerence is that the axiom ¯T +
1 demands that the poset elements be separated
by a set of upsets that are complete with respect to the C predicate and whose
complements are complete with respect to the ¯C predicate. The axiom T +
4 plays
3 ensures that ¯C
a similar role to T +
translates to actual join-completeness in any model. The result of this is that in
any model the poset elements are separated by a set of meet-complete up-closed
sets whose complements are join-complete. By corollary 2.5 this is equivalent
to them being C-ﬁlters so we are done.

in the original proof and along with T +

2

Note that this argument does not require the Sn axioms so the axiomatiza-

tion is ﬁnite, unlike the situation where α or β is ω.
