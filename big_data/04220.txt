ABSTRACT

Context. The origin of blazar variability, seen from radio up to γ rays, is still a heavily debated matter and broadband ﬂares oﬀer
a unique testbed towards a better understanding of these extreme objects. Such an energetic outburst was detected by Fermi/LAT in
2008 from the blazar PKS 1502+106. The outburst was observed from γ rays down to radio frequencies.
Aims. Through the delay between ﬂare maxima at diﬀerent radio frequencies, we study the frequency-dependent position of the
unit-opacity surface and infer its absolute position with respect to the jet base. This nuclear opacity proﬁle enables the magnetic ﬁeld
tomography of the jet. We also localize the γ-ray emission region and explore the mechanism producing the ﬂare.
Methods. The radio ﬂare of PKS 1502+106 is studied through single-dish ﬂux density measurements at 12 frequencies in the range
2.64 to 226.5 GHz. To quantify it, we employ both a Gaussian process regression and a discrete cross-correlation function analysis.
Results. We ﬁnd that the light curve parameters (ﬂare amplitude and cross-band delays) show a power-law dependence on frequency.
Delays decrease with frequency, and the ﬂare amplitudes increase up to about 43 GHz and then decay. This behavior is consistent
with a shock propagating downstream the jet. The self-absorbed radio cores are located between ∼10 and 4 pc from the jet base and
their magnetic ﬁeld strengths range between 14 and 176 mG, at the frequencies 2.64 to 86.24 GHz. Finally, the γ-ray active region is
located at (1.9 ± 1.1) pc away from the jet base.

1. Introduction
Blazars comprise the radio-loud minority of active galactic
nuclei (AGN) with energetic jets seen at small viewing an-
gles. Observationally, they exhibit strong variability across the
whole electromagnetic spectrum. However, its origin and ex-
treme characteristics (broadband ﬂux density outbursts with
down to minute-long time scales) are still a matter of intense
debate. Moreover, uncertainty still enshrouds the exact location
of its high-energy component, observed at MeV–TeV energies.
A multitude of mechanisms has been proposed in order to
explain this intense activity. Among those are: shocks generated
and propagating along the relativistic jet (e.g. Marscher & Gear
1985; Valtaoja et al. 1992), colliding relativistic plasma shells
(Spada et al. 2001), precession of the jet (e.g. Lister et al. 2003),
helical motion in it (e.g Camenzind & Krockenberger 1992), or
Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities developing in the outﬂow (e.g.
Lobanov & Zensus 2001). Testing the validity of such mod-
els translates into quantitatively contrasting the observational
signatures of the mechanisms they invoke, with observations.
Multi-frequency ﬂux density monitoring can shed light onto
blazar physics by accessing time and thus spatial scales unreach-
able even by interferometric imaging. Dense, long-term, multi-
frequency monitoring oﬀers a unique opportunity for putting

blazar variability models to the test and comparing with the pre-
dictions of theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain the
emission and overall observed characteristics of those sources.

Time delays between ﬂare maxima are often seen, and usu-
ally attributed to opacity eﬀects. Flare onsets and maxima appear
ﬁrst at higher frequencies and successively progress towards the
lower end of the observing frequency range (e.g. Valtaoja et al.
1992). This is usually connected to the motion of disturbances
whose optical depth decreases, while moving downstream the jet
(e.g. Marscher & Gear 1985) and expanding adiabatically (van
der Laan 1966). Consequently, lower frequency (hence energy)
photons are able to escape the synchrotron-emitting region.

PKS 1502+106 (OR 103, S3 1502+10) at a redshift of z =
1.8385, DL = 14176.8 Mpc (Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2008),
is a powerful ﬂat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) harboring a su-
permassive black hole of ∼109M(cid:12) (Abdo et al. 2010, and ref-
erences therein). The focal point here, is the intense 2008/2010
outburst seen in PKS 1502+106 (Ciprini 2008). This pronounced
broadband ﬂare, observed from radio up to γ-ray energies, trig-
gered the ﬁrst Fermi-GST multi-frequency campaign covering
the electromagnetic spectrum in its entirety, both with ﬁlled-
aperture instruments and interferometric arrays (Karamanavis
et al. 2016, see also Karamanavis (2015) for ﬁrst results).

The scope here is to parameterize the observed outburst and
extract its relevant light curve parameters such as, the ﬂare am-

plitude at each frequency and the cross-band delays. First, using
the observed cross-band and frequency-dependent time lags we
estimate the core shift – i.e. the frequency-dependent position
of the core – with an approach other than via traditional multi-
frequency very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) measure-
ments. With the time-lag core shift at hand, an opacity proﬁle of
the source is obtained and, under the assumption of equipartition,
the magnetic ﬁeld strength along the synchrotron-self-absorbed
jet. Furthermore, the distance of each core to the vertex of the
jet, in combination with the observed delay between radio and γ
rays, allow for decisively constraining the location of the high-
energy emission.

The paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the
data set and the time series analysis techniques used. In Sect. 3
our results are presented. Sect. 4 discusses and Sect. 5 concludes
our ﬁndings. In the paper, we adopt S ∝ ν+α, where S is the
radio ﬂux density, ν the observing frequency, and α the spectral
index, along with the following cosmological parameters H0 =
71 km s−1 Mpc−1, Ωm = 0.27, and ΩΛ = 0.73.

2. Observations and data analysis
Data used in this work have been collected within the frame-
work of the F-GAMMA1 program (Fuhrmann et al. 2007; An-
gelakis et al. 2010), which includes observations with the Ef-
felsberg 100-m telescope (EB) in eight frequency bands from
2.64 to 43.05 GHz, and with the IRAM 30-m telescope (PV)
at 86.24 and 142.33 GHz. Monthly observations at EB and PV
were performed in a quasi-simultaneous manner with a typi-
cal separation of days ensuring maximum spectral coherency.
A detailed description of the observing setup and data reduction
is provided elsewhere (Fuhrmann et al. 2014; Angelakis et al.
2015; Nestoras et al. submitted). We also employ data from the
OVRO 40-m blazar monitoring program2 at 15 GHz (Richards
et al. 2011) and at 226.5 GHz from the SMA observer center
data base (Gurwell et al. 2007).

2.1. Gaussian process regression

In order to extract the light curve parameters, such as the ﬂare
amplitude and time scale at each frequency, we employ a Gaus-
sian process (GP) regression scheme (Rasmussen & Williams
2006). This is a non-parametric approach to the generalized re-
gression and prediction problem, widely used in machine learn-
ing applications and lately exploited in astronomy (e.g. Gibson
et al. 2012; Aigrain et al. 2012). While traditional ﬁtting assumes
a speciﬁc functional form f for the model, a second way to learn
f from the data is by assigning a prior probability to all functions
one considers more likely, for example on the grounds of their
smoothness; i.e. inﬁnite diﬀerentiability. A Gaussian process is
a probability distribution over functions. It constitutes the gen-
eralization of the Gaussian distribution of random variables or
vectors, into the space of functions (e.g. Rasmussen & Williams
2006; Ivezi´c et al. 2014).

In the case of AGN light curve ﬁtting, the problem has
the form of one-dimensional regression with the observables
being ﬂux density levels at certain times. For instance, given
a set of three observations, or training data points, D =
{(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)}, our problem reduces to ﬁnding the
functions, drawn from the prior distribution, that pass through

Article number, page 2 of 10

all these training points. This distribution of functions is the pos-
terior distribution and its mean, being the expected value, can
be considered as the “best-ﬁt function”. A Gaussian process is
deﬁned by its mean, µ, and covariance, k. Without loss of gener-
ality one can always assume that µ = 0 since the data can always
be shifted to accommodate for this assumption.

In the context of Gaussian processes the covariance function,
covariance kernel, or simply kernel, Cov[ f (xi), f (x j)] = k(xi, x j)
is used to deﬁne the covariance between any two function val-
ues at points xi and x j; i.e. the similarity between data points. It
is chosen on the basis of the prior beliefs for the function to be
learned. Essentially, the kernel deﬁnes the class of functions that
are likely to appear in the prior distribution which in turn deter-
mine the kind of structure that the speciﬁc GP is able to model
correctly. Kernels have their own set of parameters, called hy-
perparameters, since they deﬁne the properties of the prior dis-
tribution over functions, instead of the functions themselves. A
very useful property of kernels is that addition and multiplica-
tion between two or more of them, also produce valid covari-
ance kernels. As such, there is always the option of constructing
a covariance kernel that ﬁts the characteristics of the modelling
problem3. Here we employ the squared exponential kernel

k(xi, x j) = σ2 exp

,

(1)

(cid:34)−(xi − x j)2

(cid:35)

2l2

where the hyperparameters are
l

the characteristic length scale, denoting the distance
in the x dimension after which the function changes
signiﬁcantly, and
the variance, mapping the mean distance of the
function from its mean. Here, it serves only as a
scaling factor.

σ2

This is a widely used kernel, owing to its generality and smooth-
ness. The latter is the only assumption when using it, justiﬁed
by the fact that most time series arising from physical processes
have no reason not to be smooth. In the case of data with uncer-
tainty, one only has to add it to the noiseless covariance kernel.
In the general case, that is kn(xi, x j) = k(xi, x j) + σ2I, where I is
the identity matrix (e.g. Roberts et al. 2012).

Selecting the best set of hyperparameters using the data
themselves is referred to as training the GP or, more generally,
Bayesian model selection. In essence, one wants to update the
prior knowledge in light of a training data set. One way of doing
so is by maximizing the marginal likelihood (Williams & Ras-
mussen 1996). Letting θ denote the vector of hyperparameters,
in the case of the squared exponential kernel (Eq. 1) we have
θ = {l, σ2}.
(2)
Then, the probability (or evidence) of the training data, y, given
the hyperparameters vector θ, is
p(y| x, θ)
and the log marginal likelihood is given by
L = log p(y| x, θ) = −1
(4)

In the general case of a hyperparameter vector θ = {θ j | j =
1, ..., n}, the derivatives of the log marginal likelihood with re-
spect to each θ j are

Notes. Columns: (1) observing frequency, (2) minimum ﬂux density
subtracted prior to the ﬁt, (3) ﬂare amplitude, (4) time of ﬂare maxi-
mum, (5) ﬂare rising, and (6) decay time. An uncertainty due to tempo-
ral resolution of up to 0.3 d can be expected for tm, yielding an uncer-
tainty of about 0.4 d for tr and td.

Equation 5 can be used with any numerical gradient optimization
algorithm in order to maximize the log marginal likelihood and
return the set of best hyperparameters for the problem at hand. A
schematic algorithm is given in Rasmussen & Williams (2006).
For the application of the method to the radio light curves
of PKS 1502+106, a variant of the algorithm presented in Pe-
dregosa et al. (2011) has been used, developed speciﬁcally for
this purpose. The complete suite of machine learning programs
can be accessed online4. Here, we consider the full length of
each available light curve. Since consequent ﬂares start without
necessarily reaching a quiescent level prior to the onset of a new
one, before proceeding with the Gaussian process regression, we
subtract the minimum ﬂux density level observed at each fre-
quency, S 0, from the corresponding light curve. To ensure the
best unbiased result we perform the process with 100 random
initializations of the length scale parameter, l. Upon completion,
the posterior mean is returned along with a robust uncertainty es-
timate in the form of a 95% conﬁdence interval for the ﬂux den-
sity, and the set of hyperparameters maximizing the log marginal
likelihood. Consequently, we are able to extract the ﬂare ampli-
tude, S m, the time of maximum ﬂux density, tm, and the cross-
band delay, τGP. Additionally, the ﬂare rising and decay times (tr
and td, respectively) are extracted from the times of the two ﬂux-
density minima bracketing S m. In Fig. 1 the results of regression
at each frequency are visualized. The values of S m, tm, tr, and td
characterizing the ﬂare are visible in Tab. 1.

2.2. The discrete cross-correlation function
Putative correlated variability across observing bands, based on
sampling-rate-limited time series, can be investigated and quan-
tiﬁed using the discrete cross-correlation function (DCCF, Edel-
son & Krolik 1988).

The cross-correlation function (CCF), as a function of the
time lag τ, for two discrete and evenly sampled light curves, x(ti)
and y(ti), is given by

N(cid:88)

[x(ti) − ¯x](cid:2)y(ti − τ) − ¯y(cid:3)

CCF(τ) =

is the mean value of the light curve x(ti),
its standard deviation,
is the mean of the light curve y(ti), and
is the standard deviation of light curve y(ti).

Uneven sampling of light curves introduces the need for the dis-
crete cross-correlation function (Edelson & Krolik 1988, see also
Larsson 2012; Robertson et al. 2015). Contrary to linear interpo-
lation methods, the DCCF takes into consideration only the data
points themselves. For two irregularly sampled light curves, the
unbinned CCF (UCCF) is

UCCFi j(τ) =

(cid:114)(cid:88)(cid:104)

where ¯ε is the mean measurement uncertainty of each data set.
For the calculation of the mean and standard deviation, only data
within each time lag bin are considered. Averaging the UCCF
over the number of data pairs, M, yields the DCCF (DCCF =

(cid:80) UDCFi j) and an uncertainty associated with each time lag

Positive DCCF values indicate a positive correlation with an av-
erage time shift τ, while negative values imply anti-correlation.
Using the DCCF, Fuhrmann et al. (2014) searched for possi-
ble correlations between the 3 mm radio waveband and the Fermi
γ-ray observations for the F-GAMMA blazar sample. Their
study has shown the presence of signiﬁcantly correlated 3 mm/γ-
ray variability in an average sense (whole sample). Speciﬁcally,
for PKS 1502+106 a 3 mm/γ-ray correlation is detected at a sig-
niﬁcance level above 99%, with the mm-radio emission lagging
behind γ rays by 14 ± 11 days. The aforementioned diﬀerence
in the time of arrival translates into a de-projected relative sep-
aration of the corresponding emitting regions of 2.1 pc, with the
γ-ray active region upstream of the 3 mm (or 86.24 GHz) core.

Here, we enhance these ﬁndings and quantify the correlated
variability beyond the mm/sub-mm band using all available radio
observations (see Fig. 1 for the light curves). The DCCFs have
been calculated between the 15 GHz light curve of the OVRO
40 m blazar monitoring program and all available light curves,
from 226.5 down to 2.64 GHz. For each DCCF we employed a
time lag bin width of 30 days within a window of ±750 d. The
better sampling of the OVRO 15 GHz light curve led to its selec-
tion as reference. Hereafter, we refer to the cross-correlated light
curves as the reference (OVRO 15 GHz) and the target (all the
rest). A positive lag τDCCF implies that the target waveband, lags
behind the reference frequency by τDCCF, measured in days. We
use a weighted Gaussian ﬁt, of the form G(x) = α exp
,
to obtain the DCCF peak and its position. Since the value of in-
terest is the peak of the DCCF, the Gaussian ﬁt is performed in
the time lag range that ensures better peak determination. The
mean of the Gaussian is the value of time lag τDCCF reported in
Tab. 2. Left panels of Figs. 2 and 3 show all DCCFs with respect
to our selected reference frequency along with the Gaussian ﬁt.
For estimating the time-lag uncertainty we employ the
model-independent Monte Carlo (MC) approach introduced by
Peterson et al. (1998) (see also Raiteri et al. 2003). The two main
sources of uncertainty in cross-correlation analyses – in addition
to limited data trains and consequently limited number of events

– are: (i) ﬂux uncertainties and (ii) uncertainties associated with
the uneven sampling of the light curves. The method comprises
two parts; that of the ﬂux redistribution (FR), and that of a ran-
dom sample selection (RSS), accounting for (i) and (ii) respec-
tively. The algorithm is essentially as follows:
1. Introduction of Gaussian deviates to the data, constrained by

the maximum ﬂux density uncertainty.

2. Use of a re-sampling with replacement scheme to randomly
select data points and create an equally long light curve; i.e.
a bootstrap-like procedure.

3. Calculation of the DCCF and determination of the time lag.
4. After a given number of MC realizations, obtain the cross-

correlation peak distribution (CCPD).
The uncertainty, ±∆τ68%, or simply ±∆τ, is obtained directly
from the CCPD and corresponds to the time lag interval of
(τmedian − ∆τ) and (τmedian + ∆τ), such that 68% of the realiza-
tions yield results within this interval. This estimate is equivalent
to the 1σ error, in case of a Gaussian distribution (Peterson et al.
1998). Here, 5000 MC realizations were performed.

The ﬂare amplitudes, S m, show an increasing trend with fre-
quency, up to about 43 GHz whereafter they start decaying again
as seen for 86.24, 142.33, and 226.5 GHz (see Fig. 4). As will
be discussed later, there exists a clear tendency for the ﬂare to
be visible earlier at higher frequencies, an eﬀect attributed to
synchrotron opacity (see also Fig. 5). The ﬂare rising times,
while initially increase with frequency, at frequencies higher

than 32.00 GHz show a decreasing trend (see Tab. 1). Finally,
in terms of the ﬂare decay times they seem to be following a
slightly increasing trend with observing frequency in the whole
range employed here (Tab. 1).

3.2. Frequency-dependent time lags

The DCCFs shown in Figs. 2 and 3 conﬁrm the presence of a
correlation between the outburst seen across observing frequen-
cies. Essentially in all cases, a single strong peak is clearly vis-
ible. In the following, we use the obtained time lag where the
DCCF peaks (Tab. 2), referenced to the highest-frequency, well-
sampled light curve at 142.33 GHz. The ﬁnal τDCCF are reported
in Tab. 3.

In Fig. 5 the delays obtained with both methods are shown.
The GP regression and the DCCF analysis yield conclusive re-
sults that agree very well. A systematic trend is clearly seen, in
the sense that the time lags become larger towards lower fre-
quencies. This trend is described well by a power-law. In or-
der to obtain its index, the frequency-dependent delays are ﬁt-
ted by a power-law of the form aν−1/kr using a least-squares
procedure. The results for index kr are for the GP regression
kr, GP = (1.4 ± 0.1) and kr, DCCF = (1.6 ± 0.1) for the DCCF
results. Both are shown, along with the best-ﬁt curves, in Fig. 5.
The rather conservative uncertainty estimates of the FR/RSS
method (Peterson et al. 1998) and the good agreement between
τDCCF and τGP allow an average time lag, (cid:104)τ(cid:105), and its standard
error to be obtained (Tab. 3). Hereafter, this average value is
used for all calculations and all uncertainties are formally prop-
agated. The longest delay of (205 ± 2.0) days is seen between
142.33 and 2.64 GHz. A decreasing trend is clearly visible to-
wards higher frequencies with a time lag of (136.9 ± 8.1) d at
4.85 GHz and (cid:104)τ(cid:105) = (96.2 ± 3.8) d at 8.35 GHz. Between the
two highest frequencies of 142.33 GHz and 86.24 GHz, it is
(cid:104)τ(cid:105) = (24.8 ± 0.2) days (see Tab. 3).

3.3. Time-lag core shifts and synchrotron opacity structure

Like most blazars, PKS 1502+106 features a ﬂat-spectrum core,
indicative of the superposition of optically thick synchrotron
components (e.g. Kaiser 2006). In addition to the scenario that

Article number, page 6 of 10

the observed VLBI core is the ﬁrst stationary hotspot (recolli-
mation shock) of the jet (Daly & Marscher 1988; Gómez et al.
1995), a widely accepted interpretation is that this core is the
point of the continuous ﬂow where the photons at a given fre-
quency have suﬃcient energy to escape the opacity barrier.
Within this scenario, the core is the surface where the optical
depth is close to unity at a given frequency (e.g. Königl 1981).
The standard relativistic jet paradigm (Blandford & Königl
1979; Königl 1981) predicts that the apparent position of this
unit-opacity surface depends on observing frequency. Therefore,
according to the interpretation of the VLBI core discussed above,
its position must also be frequency-dependent. This “core-shift
eﬀect” was ﬁrst observed by Marcaide & Shapiro (1984) and
ever since has been studied using multi-frequency VLBI (e.g.
Lobanov 1998; Kovalev et al. 2008; Sokolovsky et al. 2011;
Pushkarev et al. 2012). The importance of core-shift measure-
ments lies in the fact that they can provide critical insights into
the structure and physics of ultracompact jets, such as the posi-
tion of the core at each frequency relative to the jet base, and the
magnetic ﬁeld in diﬀerent locations along the relativistic ﬂow
(e.g. Lobanov 1998; Hirotani 2005).

Relative timing of total ﬂux density outbursts, as seen in
single-dish radio observations, presents a viable alternative to
VLBI core shifts. Let us return back to the standard jet model.
Here, a disturbance originating at the jet base will propagate out-
wards along the jet. As this disturbance or shock moves away
from the base it crosses the sequence of physically separated re-
gions where the jet ﬂow becomes optically thin – i.e. the VLBI
cores – as seen at a given sequence of observing frequencies.
When the disturbance reaches a given unit-opacity surface for
a given frequency νi, the synchrotron ﬂare emission most likely
becomes optically thin at νi. This appears in single-dish light
curves as a total intensity outburst, while in VLBI maps these
travelling shocks manifest as regions of enhanced emission af-
ter the core, the so-called VLBI knots (Marscher & Gear 1985).
Since the times of maxima in single-dish light curves correspond
to the ﬂare emission becoming optically thin at the unit-opacity
surface, for a given frequency, it follows that these times are
frequency-dependent as well, and carry information on the opac-
ity of each core. In other words, through relative timing of the

same ﬂaring event seen at diﬀerent bands, we can obtain a to-
mography of the jet in terms of nuclear opacity, similar to VLBI
core-shift measurements (e.g. Kudryavtseva et al. 2011; Kutkin
et al. 2014).

An important consideration to be taken into account is that
the method is based on the absence of any optically thick com-
ponent downstream of the core. If there was any, it would sooner
or later induce an opacity-driven enhancement of ﬂux density
due to its expansion and subsequent drop of density at a region
further away from the core, the position of which we try to con-
strain. Essentially, the emission needs to become optically thin
when it reaches each respective unit-opacity surface. In this re-
spect and given the spectra of VLBI components presented in
Karamanavis et al. (2016), component C3, which is used for our
calculations, is optically thin at least between 43 and 86 GHz
(spectral index α43/86 GHz = −0.8 ± 0.3).
Based on Lobanov (1998), a “time-lag core-shift” between
two frequencies ν1 and ν2, with ν2 > ν1, can be deﬁned as follows
(see also Kudryavtseva et al. 2011)

ﬁeld B(r) ∝ r−m and the electron number density Ne(r) ∝ r−n, at

tically thin spectral index. In case of external density gradients
and/or free-free absorption, it is kr > 1. For synchrotron self-
absorption (SSA) dominated opacity and equipartition between
particle energy and magnetic ﬁeld energy, kr = 1 for m = 1

mas is given by ∆r = µ(cid:104)τ(cid:105). That is, the distance traveled by
the disturbance within the time interval (cid:104)τ(cid:105) (Tab. 3). Using Ωrν

We employ Eqs. 9 and 10 to infer the separation of the ra-
dio core at each frequency from the jet base. In that, we use the
average kr = (1.5 ± 0.1) calculated based on the DCCF analysis
and the Gaussian process regression. Both agree very well with
each other indicating that kr > 1. This implies the possible pres-
ence of jet external density gradients and/or foreground free-free
absorption. Other parameters used are µ = 0.09 mas yr−1 which
corresponds the proper motion of component C3 at 86 GHz, re-
sponsible for the ﬂare, and θ = 2.6◦ the critical viewing angle

the nuclear opacity structure of
PKS 1502+106 (see Tab. 4). The largest distance of about 10 pc
is seen for the 2.64 GHz core, as expected, and distances di-
minish as we go towards higher frequencies. At observing fre-
quencies between 23.05 and 43.05 GHz the light curves become
slightly more sparsely sampled due to the fact that weather ef-
fects and poorer system performance of the Eﬀelsberg 100-m
telescope, at those bands, play an increasingly important role. At
the highest frequency of 86.24 GHz, the core lies at a distance of
(4.0 ± 1.1) pc away from the jet base.

equipartition between the energies of the magnetic ﬁeld and that
of radiating particles, and with a spectral index α = −0.5, this

are the maximum and minimum Lorentz factors

Then, the magnetic ﬁeld strength at the core is given by

Bcore(ν) = B1 pc rcore(ν)−1.

(12)

We adopt ln(γmax/γmin) = 10 and employ the values for the
Doppler factor and half-opening angle, deduced in Karamanavis
et al. (2016), of δ = 10 and φ = (1.90 ± 0.25)◦, respectively
corresponding to components travelling within the inner jet of
PKS 1502+106. Resulting values for B1 pc and Bcore are summa-
rized in Tab. 4. Here, we also report a conservative range for
these values, by combining the uncertainties of the input pa-
rameters in a way that maximizes this range. Inferred magnetic
ﬁeld strengths are higher at higher frequencies, when approach-
ing the jet base. The values range between 14 and 176 mG for
the 2.64 GHz (outermost) and 86.24 GHz (innermost) cores, re-
spectively.

The results presented here are in reasonable agreement
with the core shift measurements of PKS 1502+106 derived by
Pushkarev et al. (2012) who employ standard VLBI techniques
and obtain a separation of ∼8 pc between the 15 GHz VLBI core
and the vertex of the jet. Some discrepancies can be seen in the –
inferred from VLBI core shifts – physical parameters of the jet,
such as the magnetic ﬁeld at a distance of 1 pc and in the 15 GHz
core (B1 pc and Bcore), but these can be explained through the dif-
ferent kinematical parameters used. Speciﬁcally, Pushkarev et al.
(2012) make use of the fastest non-accelerating, component’s ap-
parent speed from data covering the period 1994 August to 2007
September, as reported in Lister et al. (2009). However, here we
use the proper motion, µ, of the knot most likely responsible
for the multi-wavelength ﬂare of 2008/2010 (knot C3 in Kara-
manavis et al. 2016) whose apparent angular velocity – while
travelling in the inner jet of PKS 1502+106 – is about half of
what Pushkarev et al. (2012) use.

4. Discussion

4.1. Localizing the γ-ray emission

Our ultimate goal of pinpointing the γ-ray emission region is
reached by combining the ﬁndings of the present study with
those of Fuhrmann et al. (2014), who deduce a relative distance
between the γ-ray active region and the 86.24 GHz unit-opacity
surface of about 2.1 pc (cf. Ramakrishnan et al. 2015). Here,
based on the opacity-driven time lags across the eleven observ-
ing frequencies, the distance of the 86.24 GHz core from the jet
base is (4.0±1.1) pc. From the combination follows that the γ-ray
emission region is best constrained to a distance of (1.9± 1.1) pc
away from the jet base. In a similar study, Max-Moerbeck et al.
(2014) obtain a time lag of (−40 ± 13) d between the leading
γ-rays and the lagging 15 GHz radio emission. Following their
argumentation, this time lag translates into a relative distance of
(2± 1) pc between the 15 GHz unit-opacity surface and the γ-ray
site. Combining our rcore at 15 GHz (Tab. 4) with the aforemen-
tioned value, we obtain a separation of (1.8±1.2) pc between the
jet base and the γ-ray active region, comparable with our previ-
ous result based on the 86.24 GHz time lag. We reiterate that in
the present work we use the VLBI kinematical parameters of the
knot connected to the 2008/10 ﬂare of PKS 1502+106 (C3, see
Sect. 3.4). Finally, our results are in agreement with the upper
limit of ≤5.9 pc reported by Karamanavis et al. (2016), based on
mm-VLBI imaging.
At (1.9 ± 1.1) pc from the jet base, the high-energy emis-
sion originates well beyond the bulk of the BLR material of
PKS 1502+106, placed at RBLR ≈ 0.1 pc (Abdo et al. 2010).
A γ-ray emission region placed so far away from the BLR al-
most negates the notion that BLR photons alone can be used as
the target photon ﬁeld for inverse Compton up-scattering to γ-
rays, thus other or additional seed photon ﬁelds (e.g. torus, syn-
chrotron self-Compton, SSC) need to be involved in the process.

4.2. A shock origin for the 2008/10 ﬂare

Overall, the slopes extracted from the multi-wavelength light
curves agree well with the expectations of the shock-in-jet model
(Marscher & Gear 1985), indicating a shock origin for the
2008/2010 ﬂare of PKS 1502+106. In the following, the ob-
served light curve parameters (ﬂare amplitudes and cross-band
delays) are discussed in conjunction with the results of analyti-

V. Karamanavis et al.: What can the 2008/10 broadband ﬂare of PKS 1502+106 tell us?

cal shock-in-jet model simulations (Fromm et al. 2015). The fre-
quency dependence of ﬂare amplitudes is shown in Fig. 4 and of
the cross-frequency delays in Fig. 5. Flare amplitudes rise with
frequency until they culminate at a frequency of about 43 GHz,
after which the amplitude of the ﬂare drops. The rise and decay
wings follow a trend that is described well by a broken power
law, in very good agreement with the shock model expectations.
The slopes are ﬂare amp rise = (0.7 ± 0.1) for the rising part of
the ﬂare amplitude and ﬂare amp decay = (−0.3 ± 0.05) for the
decaying part. The power-law slope of the observed time lags,
time−lag = −1/kr (see Sect. 3) is time−lag ≈ −0.7 (see Fig. 5).
This value is obtained by averaging over the two values arising
from the GP regression and the DCCF analysis and is in accord
with the pattern expected from the shock model. By comparing
the slope of the frequency-dependent cross-band delays with the
ﬁnding of Fromm et al. (2015), we can safely exclude the sce-
nario of a decelerating jet. Our ﬁndings in fact suggest the pres-
ence of a certain degree of acceleration taking place within the
relativistic jet of PKS 1502+106.

5. Conclusions
In the present work we exploited the dense,
long-term F-
GAMMA radio light curves in the frequency range 2.64–
142.33 GHz obtained with the Eﬀelsberg 100-m and IRAM 30-
m telescopes. The F-GAMMA data were complemented by light
curves at 15.00 GHz (OVRO) and 226.5 GHz (SMA).

A detailed section was devoted to the two independent
approaches used in order to quantify the observed ﬂare of
PKS 1502+106 in the time domain. These are: (i) a Gaussian
process regression and (ii) a discrete cross-correlation function
analysis. This is the ﬁrst time that GP regression is used in the
ﬁeld of blazar variability and it has shown to perform well. It
is a viable approach to the problem of modelling discrete, un-
evenly sampled, blazar light curves and extracting the relevant
parameters.

The ﬂare in PKS 1502+106 is a “clean”,

isolated out-
burst seen across observing frequencies. Our ﬁndings suggest
a frequency-dependence for the cross-band delays and the ﬂare
amplitudes. The ﬂare amplitudes ﬁrst increase – up to the fre-
quency of ∼43 GHz, where they peak – after which a decreasing
trend follows (Fig. 4). The times at which the ﬂare peaks are
characterized by increasing time delay towards lower frequen-
cies (Fig. 5). The characteristic dependence of these parameters
on the observing frequency can be approximated by power laws,
indicative of shock evolution and pc-scale jet acceleration.

Through the observed opacity-driven time lags, the structure
of PKS 1502+106 in terms of synchrotron opacity is deduced –
i.e. using a “time-lag core shift” method. The positions of the
ten radio unit-opacity surfaces with respect to the jet base were
deduced, with distances in the range (10.2 ± 1.2) pc to (4.1 ±
1.1) pc for the core between 2.64 and 86.24 GHz, respectively.

The frequency-dependent core positions also enable a to-
mography of the magnetic ﬁeld along the jet axis. We obtain the
equipartition magnetic ﬁeld at the position of each core, Bcore,
and also at a distance of 1 pc from the jet base, B1 pc. The former,
between the 2.64 and 86.24 GHz unit-opacity surfaces, are in the
range Bcore, 2.64 ∼ 14 mG and Bcore, 86.24 ∼ 176 mG. For the latter,
= (174± 55) mG.
our ﬁgures indicate an average value of
The γ-ray emission region is constrained to (1.9 ± 1.1) pc
away from the jet base, well beyond the bulk of the BLR material
of PKS 1502+106. This yields a contribution of IR torus photons
and/or SSC to the production of γ rays in PKS 1502+106, while

(cid:69)

almost negates the contribution of accretion disk or BLR photons
alone.

The ﬂare complies with the typical shock evolutionary path
and its overall behavior in the time domain is in accord with the
shock-in-jet scenario. When seen in the light of the VLBI ﬁnd-
ings discussed in Karamanavis et al. (2016), our results corrobo-
rate the scenario that the ﬂare of PKS 1502+106 was induced by
a shock, seen in mm-VLBI images as component C3, travelling
downstream of the core at 43/86 GHz maps. This travelling dis-
turbance is associated with the multi-frequency ﬂare seen from
radio up to γ-ray energies.
