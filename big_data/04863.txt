ABSTRACT

We present the stellar mass (M∗)–gas-phase metallicity relation (MZR) and its scatter at intermediate red-
shifts (0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7) for 1381 ﬁeld galaxies collected from deep spectroscopic surveys. The star formation
rate (SFR) and color at a given M∗ of this magnitude-limited (R . 24 AB) sample are representative of nor-
mal star-forming galaxies. For masses below 109M⊙, our sample of 237 galaxies is ∼10 times larger than
those in previous studies beyond the local universe. This huge gain in sample size enables superior con-
straints on the MZR and its scatter in the low-mass regime. We ﬁnd a power-law MZR at 108M⊙<M∗<
1011M⊙: 12 + log(O/H) = (5.83 ± 0.19) + (0.30 ± 0.02)log(M∗/M⊙). At 109M⊙<M∗< 1010.5M⊙, our
MZR shows agreement with others measured at similar redshifts in the literature. Our power-law slope is, how-
ever, shallower than the extrapolation of the MZRs of others to masses below 109M⊙. The SFR dependence
of the MZR in our sample is weaker than that found for local galaxies (known as the Fundamental Metallicity
Relation). Compared to a variety of theoretical models, the slope of our MZR for low-mass galaxies agrees
well with predictions incorporating supernova energy-driven winds. Being robust against currently uncertain
metallicity calibrations, the scatter of the MZR serves as a powerful diagnostic of the stochastic history of gas
accretion, gas recycling, and star formation of low-mass galaxies. Our major result is that the scatter of our
MZR increases as M∗ decreases. Our result implies that either the scatter of the baryonic accretion rate (σ ˙M ) or
the scatter of the M∗–Mhalo relation (σSHMR) increases as M∗ decreases. Moreover, our measures of scatter at
z = 0.7 appears consistent with that found for local galaxies. This lack of redshift evolution constrains models
of galaxy evolution to have both σ ˙M and σSHMR remain unchanged from z = 0.7 to z = 0.

1. INTRODUCTION

The relation between the gas-phase metallicity and stellar
mass (M∗) of galaxies — M∗–metallicity relation (MZR) —
is one of the most fundamental scaling relations of galaxy for-
mation. It is a sensitive tracer of gas inﬂow, consumption, and
outﬂow, all of which regulate star formation in galaxies.

The MZR in the local universe has been well determined
down to M∗∼ 108M⊙ (Tremonti et al. 2004), and has even
been explored down to ∼ 106M⊙ (Lee et al. 2006). Be-
yond the local universe, the MZR measurements have been
reported up to z ∼ 3 (e.g., Erb et al. 2006; Maiolino et al.
2008; Zahid et al. 2011; Steidel et al. 2014; Maier et al. 2014;
Sanders et al. 2015; Grasshorn Gebhardt et al. 2015). The
MZR smoothly evolves from z > 2 to z = 0, with lower red-

shift galaxies having higher metallicity at a given M∗ (e.g.,
Zahid et al. 2013; P´erez-Montero et al. 2013). Most of the
MZR measurements beyond the local universe, however, only
explore galaxies with M∗> 109M⊙, because spectroscopi-
cally observing a sufﬁciently large sample of low-mass (M∗<
109M⊙) and thus faint galaxies is very time-consuming.

The sparse number of metallicity measurements of low-
mass galaxies beyond the local universe limits our under-
standing of the redshift evolution of star-formation and feed-
back processes. First, low-mass galaxies are expected to pro-
vide the most stringent constraints on feedback, because the
effect of feedback is expected to be strong in their shallow
gravitational potential wells. Second, the scatter of the MZR
of low-mass galaxies contains clues on the stochastic nature of

2

Guo et al.

the formation mechanisms of low-mass galaxies (Forbes et al.
2014b). Comparing the scatter of low-mass and massive
galaxies would tell us whether and by how much the low-
mass galaxies are formed through a more stochastic process
than massive galaxies.

Feedback processes caused by supernovae (Dekel & Silk
1986), stellar winds (Hopkins et al. 2012), stellar radiation
pressure (Murray et al. 2005), and/or even AGN (Croton et al.
2006) have already become essential ingredients of theories
of galaxy formation (see the review of Somerville & Dav´e
2014). A complete physical picture of feedback, however,
remains to be developed. In recent years, the MZR has been
widely used in analytic, semi-analytic, and numerical models
to constrain the properties of outﬂows (e.g., Finlator & Dav´e
2008; Peeples & Shankar 2011; Dav´e et al. 2011b,a, 2012,
2013; Lilly et al. 2013; Forbes et al. 2014b; Lu et al. 2015a).
To understand the redshift evolution of the outﬂow properties,
e.g., the strength, velocity, mass loading factor, metallicity,
etc., the MZR measurements at different redshifts are needed.
The observations of the MZR of low-mass galaxies be-
yond the local universe are sparse. The 26 galaxies of
Henry et al. (2013a, H13) comprise the ﬁrst measurement of
the intermediate-redshift MZR below 109M⊙. Their MZR is
consistent with the equilibrium model with momentum-driven
winds (Dav´e et al. 2012, D12), but their SFR–M∗ relation fa-
vors, in contrast, energy-driven winds. It is possible that the
equilibrium models endure a breakdown in low-mass galax-
ies, but the small sample size of H13 also urges the need
of large sample to present a robust constraint on the MZR
at the low-mass end. Henry et al. (2013b) push the metal-
licity measurements of low-mass galaxies to higher redshifts
at 1.3 < z < 2.3 by stacking the HST/WFC3 grism of 83
galaxies in the WISP Survey (Atek et al. 2010; Colbert et al.
2013). Although the stacked spectrum in each M∗ bin has a
sufﬁciently high signal-to-noise ratio, it loses information of
individual galaxies.

The scatter of the MZR of low-mass galaxies beyond the
local universe is also unexplored. In the local universe, both
Tremonti et al. (2004) and Zahid et al. (2012) observed an in-
creasing scatter as M∗ decreases. In contrast, Lee et al. (2006)
found a constant scatter over a 5-dex range of M∗, but the
sample size of the latter is small. While Zahid et al. (2011)
provides a robust measurement of the scatter of the MZR
at z ∼ 0.8 with a sufﬁciently large sample from DEEP2,
their galaxies (M∗> 109M⊙) do not extend to the low-mass
regime.

In this paper, we collect data from large spectro-
scopic surveys in the CANDELS ﬁelds (Grogin et al. 2011;
Koekemoer et al. 2011) to study the MZR and its scatter at
0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 down to M∗∼ 108M⊙. Although none of
these surveys (typically limited to R . 24.1) is designed
to study low-mass galaxies, each still contains a sufﬁciently
large number of low-mass galaxies. Combining them together
provides the largest sample to date in the low-mass regime at
0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7. Recently, extremely metal-poor dwarf galax-
ies have been found at similar redshifts (e.g., Amor´ın et al.
2014; Ly et al. 2014b), but the main trend and its scatter of
the MZR at M∗< 109M⊙ is still not well determined.

We adopt a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology with Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ =
0.7 and the Hubble constant h ≡ H0/100km s−1 Mpc−1 =
0.70. All magnitudes are on the AB scale (Oke 1974). The
Chabrier (2003) initial mass function is used. The adopted
solar metallicity is 12+log(O/H)=8.69 (Allende Prieto et al.
2001; Asplund et al. 2009).

2. DATA

Three deep ﬁeld galaxy spectroscopic surveys are used in
this paper: Team Keck Treasury Redshift Survey (TKRS;
Wirth et al. 2004), DEEP2 (Newman et al. 2013), and DEEP3
(Cooper et al. 2011, 2012). Since they are well documented
and widely discussed in the literature, we only summarize
them in Table 1 and refer readers to the survey papers for de-
tails.

From each survey, our sample includes only galaxies with
reliable spectroscopic redshifts at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 and 3σ
[OIII] and Hβ detection. To remove AGN contamination,
we exclude galaxies that fall in the upper region (main AGN
region) of the mass–excitation ([OIII]/Hβ vs. M∗) diagram
deﬁned by Juneau et al. (2011). The [OIII]/Hβ metallicity in-
dicator has the issue of the lower–upper branch degeneracy
(see Section 3.3). Additional emission lines are needed to
break the degeneracy. The effect of the degeneracy on the
MZR, however, is believed to be negligible for galaxies with
M∗>109M⊙ (Zahid et al. 2011, and H13). Therefore, in this
mass regime, we use all TKRS, DEEP2, and DEEP3 galaxies,
but at M∗≤109M⊙, we only use TKRS and DEEP3 galaxies,
which include also [OII] observation to help break the degen-
eracy. The ﬁnal sample consists of 1381 galaxies. Among
them, 273 galaxies have M∗< 109M⊙, comprising a sample
∼10 times larger than previous studies in this mass regime at
similar redshift (e.g., H13). The numbers of galaxies from
each survey are listed in Table 1.

For each galaxy, we ﬁt its multi-wavelength broad-band
photometry to synthetic stellar populating models to mea-
sure M∗. For TKRS, we use FAST (Kriek et al. 2009) to
ﬁt the Bruzual & Charlot (2003) models to CANDELS multi-
wavelength catalog (Barro in preparation, see also Guo et al.
2013). For DEEP2/3, we use the EGS multi-wavelength cat-
alog of Barro et al. (2011a), which is constructed based on
Spitzer/IRAC 3.6µm detection. The SED-ﬁtting process, de-
tailed in Barro et al. (2011b), also uses the Bruzual & Charlot
(2003) models.

SFRs are measured by following the SFR “ladder” method
in Wuyts et al. (2011). This method relies on IR-based SFR
estimates for galaxies detected at mid- to far-IR wavelengths,
and SED-modeled SFRs for the rest. For IR-detected galaxies
the total SFRs (SFR IR+UV) were computed from a combi-
nation of IR and rest-frame UV luminosity (uncorrected for
extinction) following Kennicutt (1998). For non-IR-detected
galaxies, SFRs are measured from the extinction-corrected
rest-frame UV luminosity. As shown in Wuyts et al. (2011)
the agreement between the two estimates for galaxies with
a moderate extinction (faint IR ﬂuxes) ensures the continu-
ity between the different SFR estimates. We refer readers to
Barro et al. (2011b, 2013) for the details of our SFR measure-
ments.

An important issue is whether our sample is representative,
because it is collected from surveys which were not designed
to uniformly select low-mass galaxies. Moreover, our S/N
threshold on emission lines would introduce the Malmquist
bias towards [OIII]- and Hβ-bright galaxies. To test how rep-
resentative our sample is, we compare the M∗–speciﬁc SFR
(SSFR) and M∗–color relations of our sample to those of a
mass-complete sample (parent sample) of the ﬁeld of each
survey at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7. For TKRS, we use CANDELS
GOODS-N galaxies with H < 25.0 as the parent samples,
which are approximately complete at M∗> 108M⊙. For
DEEP2/3, we use the IRAC-detected (m3.6µm < 24.0) galax-

FIG. 1.— Sample properties. The SSFR–M∗ and U-B color–M∗ relations of the galaxies in our sample are plotted as red symbols (plus red contours for
DEEP2/3). For each survey (as shown by the title of the upper panels), the mean and 1σ scatter of the SSFR–M∗ relation of our galaxies are shown by large
blue circles with error bars. Over-plotted black dots (plus gray contours for DEEP2/3) are the mass-complete parent samples, constructed with galaxies with
0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 and H < 25.0 from CANDELS/GOODS-N (left column) catalog and m3.6µm < 24 from EGS (right column). The mean and 1σ scatter of
star-forming galaxies (SSFR> 10−10/yr) in the parent samples, i.e., the star-forming main sequence at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7, are shown by solid and dashed black
lines.

ies at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 from Barro et al. (2011b).

Figure 1 shows that our sample is actually fairly represen-
tative of star-forming galaxies, in terms of SSFR and color at
a given M∗. The median SSFRs of our TKRS and DEEP2/3
samples match the medians of the GOODS-N and EGS parent
samples down to M∗= 109M⊙. Below 109M⊙, the average
SSFR of our sample is slightly higher than that of the star-
forming main-sequence at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7. At M∗< 109M⊙,
the median SSFR of our DEEP2/3 sample is higher than that
of EGS parent sample by 0.3 dex, which is still less than
the scatter of the parent sample (0.5 dex). Since our whole
sample is dominated by DEEP2/3 sources, the comparison re-
sults of DEEP2/3 (middle column of Figure 1) can be treated
as being representative of our whole sample. Overall, our
sample is representative for normal star-forming galaxies at
0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7, but slightly biased toward high-SSFR galaxies
at M∗< 109M⊙. This bias is also reﬂected in the M∗–color
diagram, where our sample is biased toward bluer galaxies at
M∗< 109M⊙. This bias mainly stems from both the R-band
selection (rest-frame ∼4100 ˚A at these redshifts) of each sur-
vey and our requirement of the emission lines to be detected
above the 3σ level. In Appendix A, we show that neither the
S/N cut itself nor the bias toward higher-SSFR galaxies intro-
duces signiﬁcant systematic offsets to our derived MZR.

3. METALLICITY MEASUREMENT

3.1. Line Ratio Measurement

We use the [OIII]/Hβ ﬂux ratio to measure gas-phase metal-
licity. Unless otherwise noted, [OIII] throughout the paper
stands for [OIII]5007 ˚A. A problem of using [OIII]/Hβ to de-
rive the metallicity is its dependence on both the ionization
parameter and effective temperature. Another metallicity in-
dicator, R23≡([OII]3727 ˚A+[OIII]4959,5007 ˚A)/Hβ, is often
used for optical spectroscopy at similar redshifts. Compared
to [OIII]/Hβ, R23 has a weaker dependence on the ionization
parameter, but it requires an accurate measurement of dust
extinction because the extinction is stronger for [OII] than for
[OIII]. On the other hand, [OIII]/Hβ is essentially unaffected
by dust reddening because the wavelengths of [OIII] and Hβ
are quite close. Because only a subset (DEEP3+TKRS) of our
sample has [OII] observed, for consistency, we only use R23
to calibrate our metallicity measurement, but use [OIII]/Hβ to
derive the metallicity of the whole sample.

To measure the ﬂuxes of [OIII] and Hβ (and [OII] if avail-
able), we follow the steps taken by Trump et al. (2013). First,
a continuum is ﬁtted across the emission line regions by splin-
ing the 50-pixel smoothed continuum. Then, a Gaussian func-
tion is ﬁtted to the continuum-subtracted ﬂux in the wave-
length regions of the emission lines. The emission line inten-
sities are computed as the area under the best-ﬁt Gaussian in
the line wavelength regions. To correct for the stellar absorp-
tion of Hβ, we follow previous studies with DEIMOS spec-
tra (e.g., Cowie & Barger 2008; Zahid et al. 2011, and H13)
by assuming an equivalent width (EW) of 1 ˚A. We then add
the product of the EW and continuum to the Hβ ﬂuxes. The
EW correction factor is important for our metallicity measure-
ment. The value of the Hb EW absorption correction depends
on the spectral resolution, and studies with lower spectral res-
olution typically use larger correction factors, e.g., 3 ˚A used
by Lilly et al. (2003). In Appendix A, we demonstrate that
increasing our EW correction to 3 ˚A increases the normaliza-
tion of our derived MZR by 0.1 dex, but does not change its
slope and scatter.

FIG. 2.— Upper: [OIII]/Hβ ﬂux ratio as a function of M∗ for galaxies in
our sample. Galaxies from different surveys are shown by ﬁlled circles with
different colors. The DEEP2 (and DEEP3) distribution is shown by red (and
gray) contours plus red (and black) circles. The thick black (and thin gray)
error bars show the median (and 90 percentile) of the 1σ uncertainty of the
[OIII]/Hβ and M∗ measurements. For comparison, data of H13 are shown as
yellow triangles. Lower: Sample-to-sample variation on the [OIII]/Hβ ﬂux
ratio. We use our DEEP2 sub-sample as a base sample and show the ratio
between the average [OIII]/Hβ of any other sub-samples and that of the base
sample. The color scheme is the same as that in the upper panel. The base
sample (DEEP2) is shown as a constant red solid line at unity, and its 1σ
conﬁdence level is shown by red dashed lines. H13 data are shown as yellow
triangles, while their average values are shown as large yellow circles.

The [OIII]/Hβ ﬂux ratio of the whole sample is shown as
a function of M∗ in the upper panel of Figure 2. Although
galaxies from different surveys have different spectral resolu-
tions and exposure times, they occupy a similar locus in the
plot. A more clear view of the sample-to-sample variation
is shown in the lower panel of Figure 2.
In this panel, we
use our DEEP2 sub-sample as a base sample and compare the
average [OIII]/Hβ of other sub-samples to that of the base
sample. The comparisons, namely the ratios of the average
[OIII]/Hβ of other sub-samples to that of the base sample, are
close to unity in most M∗ bins, suggesting a consistency of
line-ratio measurements between the sub-samples with differ-
ent observational effects.

Each sub-sample only shows deviation from the base sam-

Dwarf Metallicity

ple in its lowest M∗ bin, where the sub-sample is subjected
to small number statistics. TKRS deviates from DEEP2 and
DEEP3 at < 108M⊙<M∗< 108.5M⊙, where TKRS only has
7 galaxies, while both DEEP2 and DEEP3 each have around
50 galaxies. The deviation of TKRS does not affect our later
conclusions in this mass regime. At M∗< 108M⊙, both
DEEP2 and DEEP3 have only 6-7 galaxies and hence show
large discrepancy. In our later analysis, we show the results
of this mass regime in plots, but do not use them in ﬁtting
or to draw any conclusions. Overall, the consistency of line-
ratio measurements suggests that our combination of different
surveys introduces no signiﬁcant biases.

The galaxies of H13 (yellow triangles in both panels) pro-
vide an independent check on our [OIII]/Hβ measurements.
In general, the H13 data follow our main trend. Although the
average [OIII]/Hβ of H13 is constantly higher than that of our
DEEP2 base sample by a factor of 1.2 at M∗< 109.5M⊙, the
deviation is still within 1σ conﬁdence level of our base sample
(red dashed lines). We therefore conclude that our measure-
ments are consistent with those in the literature.

We use R23 to calibrate our [OIII]/Hβ-derived metallicity.
Our DEEP3 and TKRS galaxies comprise a training sample,
because they have [OII] observed. For each DEEP3 or TKRS
galaxy with [OII] S/N>3, we measure its R23-derived metal-
licity with the M08 calibration. When measuring R23, we
correct for dust extinctions of [OII], [OIII], and Hβ by con-
verting stellar continuum extinction E(B − V)∗, which is de-
rived through the SED-ﬁtting process performed when mea-
suring M∗ of our galaxies (see Section 2), into gas extinc-
tion E(B − V)gas through E(B − V)gas = E(B − V)∗/0.44
(Calzetti et al. 2000).

The comparison between the two metallicities is shown in
Figure 3. Both [OIII]/Hβ and R23 face the issue of non-
unique metallicity solutions, i.e, a given line ratio has two so-
lutions: a lower-metallicity value (lower branch) and a higher-
metallicity one (upper branch). For each galaxy here, we
compare its solution in the same branch of [OIII]/Hβ and
R23, i.e., upper vs. upper (circles in the panel) and lower
vs. lower (squares). We will break the branch degeneracy for
each galaxy later.

[OIII]/Hβ in the DEEP3 sample. Circles (the right locus) show the case of us-
ing the upper-branch metallicity values for all galaxies, while squares (the left
locus) the lower-branch values. Red (green) diamonds and error bars show
the median and 16 and 84 percentiles of the comparison for the upper (lower)
branch case. The red (green) curve shows a second-order polynomial ﬁt to
the comparison of the upper (lower) branch case. The right and left black
(gray) error bars show the median (90 percentile) measurement uncertainty
of the upper and lower branches, respectively.

3.2. Metallicity Calibration

The [OIII]/Hβ ﬂux ratio is then converted to metallicity
through the calibration of Maiolino et al. (2008, M08). For
the low-metallicity regime (12+log(O/H)<8.3), M08 cali-
brate their relations using galaxies with metallicities derived
using the electron temperature Te method from Nagao et al.
(2006). For high-metallicity galaxies from SDSS DR4, they
use the photoionization models of Kewley & Dopita (2002,
KD02) to infer metallicity. A polynomial ﬁt is used to con-
nect the low- and high-metallicity galaxies.

FIG. 4.— Using [OIII]/[OII] to break the lower–upper branch degeneracy
in the DEEP3+TKRS training sample. Each black circle with gray error bars
shows one galaxy. Galaxies above log([OIII]/[OII])=0.375 (black horizontal
line) are identiﬁed to use their lower-branch metallicities, and vice versa. In
each mass bin (width of 0.4 dex), the fraction of galaxies in the lower branch
is given by the blue number in top. For comparison, data of H13 are shown
as yellow triangles.

lower branch, the deviation increases as the metallicity de-
creases, from ∼0.1 dex at 12+log(O/H)=7.5 to ∼0.3 at
12+log(O/H)=7.0. We will show later, however, that no
galaxies would take a lower-branch solution smaller than
12+log(O/H)=7.3 when we break the degeneracy. We
ﬁt a second-order polynomial function to the Z(R23)–
Z([OIII]/Hβ) relation of the upper branch (red curves) and
lower branch (green curves), respectively. We then use the
best-ﬁt relation to correct the [OIII]/Hβ-derived metallicities
— both the upper- and lower-branch solutions — of all our

galaxies in the four surveys, regardless of whether they have
[OII] observations.

3.3. Breaking the Upper–Lower Branch Degeneracy

To break the degeneracy between the two branches, we use
our DEEP3+TKRS galaxies as the training sample, where
both [OII] and [OIII] are observed. As shown by M08,
[OIII]/[OII] decreases monotonically with metallicity and
hence can be used as an indicator to break the degener-
acy. H13 showed that ([OIII]4959,5007 ˚A)/[OII]>3.0 works
as a reasonable threshold to identify lower-branch galaxies.
The threshold of 3.0 corresponds to 12+log(O/H)∼8.0 (M08),
which is the turnover point of the two branches of [OIII]/Hβ.
We assume a ﬂux ratio [OIII]4959 ˚A:[OIII]5007 ˚A=1:3, so our
threshold is log([OIII]/[OII])=0.375 (the horizontal line in
Figure 4). Galaxies with log([OIII]/[OII])>0.375 are iden-
tiﬁed to be in the lower branch, and vice versa 1. For each M∗
bin, we calculate the fraction of galaxies that are in the lower
branch. At M∗> 109M⊙, only 2% of the galaxies are in the
lower branch. This is consistent with the fact that, although
galaxies with very low metallicity have been found at z ∼ 0.7
(Hoyos et al. 2005; Amor´ın et al. 2014; Ly et al. 2014a,b),
their number densities are quite low. But the fraction in-
creases towards lower M∗, and about 25% of the galaxies at
M∗< 108.3M⊙ are in the lower branch. Henry et al. (2013b)
ﬁnd a turnover of the R23–M∗ relation at M∗∼ 108.5M⊙ in
their stacked HST/WFC3 grism spectra. Although they can-
not break the degeneracy for individual galaxies because of
using the stacked spectra, their result suggests that the lower-
branch fraction becomes larger when M∗ decreases and that
the majority of low-mass galaxies are in the lower branch.

The above [OIII]/[OII] threshold and thus determined
lower-branch fraction are only valid for our metallicity in-
dicator [OIII]/Hβ in the M08 calibration. The “turnover”
point of the two branches is different for different metallic-
ity indicators and calibrations. For example, for [OIII]/Hbeta
in M08, the turnover point is around 12+log(O/H)∼8.0 (see
Figure 5 of M08), but for R23 in KD02,
the turnover
point is around 12+log(O/H)∼8.4. Therefore, galaxies with
12+log(O/H)=8.0–8.4 would be in the upper branch of our
[OIII]/Hbeta but in the lower branch of R23 of KD02. This
difference can explain the discrepancy between our lower-
branch fraction and that of other studies with different metal-
licity indicators. For example, Maier et al. (2015) ﬁnd a
higher fraction of lower-branch galaxies at M∗> 109.5M⊙
using R23 of KD02. The lowest metallicity in Maier et al.
(2015) is around 12+log(O/H)∼8.3, which is still in the upper
branch of [OIII]/Hbeta. Therefore, we expect to ﬁnd no ob-
ject in our [OIII]/Hbeta lower-branch at this mass regime, as
demonstrated in Figure 4. In this sense, our results are con-
sistent with Maier et al. (2015).

4. STELLAR MASS–METALLICITY RELATION AT

0.5 ≤ Z ≤ 0.7

4.1. Stellar Mass–Metallicity Relation at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7

1 Here, we do not consider the measurement uncertainties of [OIII]/[OII].
A possible caveat of ignoring the uncertainties is that if the number of galax-
ies decreases dramatically as [OIII]/[OII] increases at a give M∗, the Ed-
dington bias would scatter more galaxies into the lower-branch region (above
0.375) than out of the region (below 0.375) and hence artiﬁcially increase
our lower-branch fraction. To quantify this effect requires a large complete
sample rather than a representative sample as used in our paper.

We ﬁrst measure the MZR of the DEEP3+TKRS sample,
in which each galaxy breaks the lower–upper branch degen-
eracy by using the [OIII]/[OII] threshold. The MZR (called
“upper+lower z” hereafter) is shown in Panel (a) of Figure
5. For each galaxy with log([OIII]/[OII])>0.375, we con-
nect its lower branch (black circle) and upper branch (gray
circle) metallicities with a gray vertical line to show the dif-
ference between the two solutions. For these galaxies, we use
their lower-branch solutions when deriving the MZR, while
for other galaxies, we use their upper-branch solutions.

We ﬁt a polynomial function to the DEEP3+TKRS “up-

per+lower z” MZR:

12 + log(O/H) = c0 + c1x + c2x2,

(1)

where x = log(M∗/M⊙). This function becomes a linear
function when c2 = 0. The best-ﬁt parameters, with a free c2
and a ﬁxed c2 = 0, are shown in Table 2.

The second-order polynomial ﬁt (red dashed line in Panel
(a)) shows almost no difference from the linear ﬁt (red solid
line), except at the very massive end. The χ2 value of the
polynomial ﬁt is comparable to that of the linear ﬁt, but an F -
test shows that the former does not signiﬁcantly improve the
goodness-of-ﬁt by adding one more free parameter. There-
fore, we choose the linear ﬁt as our preferred function. The
linear DEEP3+TKRS MZR has a slope of 0.30 ± 0.02. For
a comparison, we also measure the MZR by using the up-
per branch solutions for all galaxies. Not surprisingly, the ﬁts
(blue solid and dashed lines and parameters of “upper Z” in
Table 2) show a ﬂatter slope at the low-mass end.

Panel (a) shows a gap in the metallicity distribution at
M∗< 109.5M⊙. This gap exists because we only allow each
galaxy to use one metallicity from its upper- and lower-branch
values. The discreteness of the two branches results in the
gap. For example, in Panel (a), a galaxy whose upper and
lower branch metallicities are connected by a vertical gray
line can only choose either of its two endpoints but no other
values. This gap is a generic feature of some metallicity cal-
ibrations when breaking the degeneracy. It is independent on
which emission lines are used to measure the metallicity. A
similar gap also exists even if we use the M08 calibration of
the R23 indicator. Similar gaps from different line ratios and
calibrations can be seen from Panel (3), (4), and (5) of Figure
1 of Kewley & Ellison (2008).

Choosing one value from the two branches is a determin-
istic method, which over-simpliﬁes the metallicity calibration
in the “turnover” region by not taking into account of the dis-
persion (or uncertainty) of the calibration. For example, the
[OIII]/Hβ-metallicity calibration used in our paper, namely
the “best-ﬁt” relation of M08, has been shown to have a dis-
persion of about 0.15 dex on [OIII]/Hβ at a given metallicity
(Figure 5 of M08 and Figure 17 of Nagao et al. (2006)). This
dispersion (either intrinsic or due to measurement uncertain-
ties), when being converted into the dispersion of metallicity
at a given emission-line ratio, would cause the emission-line
ratios to lose their diagnostic powers in the “turnover” region:
a wide range of metallicity may have the same emission-line
ratio (see Figure 11 of Kewley & Ellison (2008) for an exam-
ple of R23). In principle, this dispersion should be taken into
account when converting emission-line ratios into metallicity.
This step, however, requires that the dispersion is measured
from a sample of galaxies that matches the properties of the
sample of interest for the metallicity measurement. Because
of the lack of such a sample at our target redshift, we skip this

the lower–upper branch degeneracy using the threshold in Figure 4. For each lower-branch galaxy, we also show its upper-branch metallicity by a gray circle
and connect it to its lower-branch metallicity with a gray vertical line. The means, best linear ﬁt, and best second-order polynomial ﬁt of the metallicity after
breaking the degeneracy (“upper+lower z”) are shown by red open circles, solid line, and dashed line. As a reference, the blue solid and dashed lines show the
best linear and second-order polynomial ﬁts of the sample using the upper-branch metallicities (“upper Z”) for all galaxies. The upper and lower black (gray)
error bars show the median (90 percentile) measurement uncertainty of the upper and lower branches, respectively. (b): MZR of our DEEP3+TKRS sample with
metallicity measured through [OIII]/[OII]. The means, best linear ﬁt, best second-order polynomial ﬁt are shown by green open squares, solid line, and dashed

are signiﬁcantly subjected to the branch degeneracy and hence not used in our later analyses. The best linear and second-order polynomial ﬁts are shown by
purple solid and dashed lines. The means of DEEP3+TKRS are shown as open circles ([OIII]/Hβ-derived “upper+lower Z”) and squares ([OIII]/[OII]-derived).
Data from H13, after being converted to the M08 metallicity calibration, are shown as yellow triangles in Panel (a), (b), and (c). (d): Comparison between our

step and retrograde to the deterministic method, but test its
effect on our MZR measurement.

To test the effect of the gap on our MZR measurement,
we need an indicator that changes monotonically with metal-
licity to provide an independent check. [NII]/Hα is usually
the ﬁrst choice for lower-redshift galaxies, but it is shifted
out of the wavelength window of our data. Here, we use
[OIII]/[OII]. Although [OIII]/[OII] is in fact a diagnostic of
ionization parameter, it also provides a sort of metallicity

measurement, thanks to the tight relation between ioniza-
tion parameter and metallicity (see Nagao et al. 2006, for de-
tailed discussions). The tight relation between ionization pa-
rameter and metallicity is also manifested by the tight lo-
cus of star-forming main sequence galaxies in the BPT di-
agrams (e.g., Cid Fernandes et al. 2007; Kewley et al. 2013;
Maier et al. 2015). We use the calibration of M08 to convert
[OIII]/[OII] to metallicity. Grasshorn Gebhardt et al. (2015)
shows that the calibration evolves little from M08’s local

Note: (a): DEEP3+TKRS galaxies have [OII] measurements to allow breaking the lower–upper branch degeneracy. DEEP2 galaxies have no [OII] measurements.
We therefore only ﬁt the DEEP2 MZR with galaxies at M∗≥ 109M⊙, where the fraction of galaxies in the lower branch is negligible. (b): This column indicates
whether we break the lower–upper branch degeneracy. “upper+lower Z” uses the metallicity values after breaking the lower–upper branch degeneracy using the
[OIII]/[OII] threshold in Figure 4. “upper Z” does not break the degeneracy and uses the upper-branch metallicity for all galaxies. There is no branch degeneracy
issue for the metallicity measured through [OIII]/[OII]. (c): The ﬁducial MZR relation is used in our later comparison with other MZR measurements and models.

galaxies to their z∼2 galaxies.

The new MZR is shown in Panel (b) of Figure 5. There is
no gap of metallicity in this panel, although the scatter is in-
creased. The median relation and 1σ deviation (green squares
with error bars) agree very well with the data points of H13,
which are measured through R23. This comparison ensures
that using [OIII]/[OII] is able to recover the median metallic-
ity at each M∗ bin. Also, the comparison between the best-
ﬁt relations of the [OIII]/Hβ-derived and [OIII]/[OII]-derived
MZRs (red and green lines in Panel (d)) shows only small sys-
tematic offset of ∼0.05 dex in normalization and no changes
at all in slope. Such good agreement demonstrates that our
method of breaking the branch degeneracy introduces no sig-
niﬁcant effects on both the slope and the normalization of
the MZR. We therefore use the “upper+lower z” MZR as our
ﬁducial one to compare with other measurements and models
later.

In Panel (d) of Figure 5, we also show the mean metallic-
ity of each M∗ bin by using the R23 indicator of M08 (blue
triangles). The upper–lower degeneracy is also broken by us-
ing the same [OIII]/[OII] threshold in Figure 4. The mean
R23 metallicity shows very small deviation from our mean
[OIII]/Hβ-derived metallicity. This result again demonstrates
that the slope and normalization of our MZR derived through
[OIII]/Hβ-derived are robust.

To provide a better statistics, we also measure the MZR
of our DEEP2 sample through [OIII]/Hβ. Since we do not
have [OII] observation for DEEP2 galaxies, we are not able
to break the branch degeneracy. We therefore only measure
the DEEP2 MZR down to 109M⊙, because, as shown by the
lower-branch fraction of DEEP3+TKRS in Figure 4, the num-
ber of lower-branch galaxies is negligible in the massive and
intermediate-mass regimes. For galaxies at M∗> 109M⊙, the
DEEP2 median MZR matches that of DEEP3+TKRS (both
[OIII]/Hβ and [OIII]/[OII] derived) very well (Panel (c) of
Figure 5).

4.2. Comparison with Other MZRs

Our ﬁducial MZR (“upper+lower z”) at M∗> 109M⊙
shows good agreement with other measurements at simi-
lar redshifts in the literature. Panel (d) of Figure 5 shows
the MZRs of M08, Zahid et al. (2013), de los Reyes et al.
(2015), and Maier et al. (2015), all converted to the calibra-
tion of KD02 (the same calibration used in M08 for high-
metallicity galaxies) using the calibration conversion table
of Kewley & Ellison (2008). At 109M⊙<M∗< 1010.5M⊙,
other MZRs show a deviation of only <0.05 dex from ours,

which is much smaller than the scatter of our sample. At
M∗< 109M⊙, the average metallicity of H13 (also converted
to the calibration of M08) is higher than our best-ﬁt MZR by
∼0.1 dex at M∗< 108.5M⊙, which can be attributed to the
fact that H13 assumes all galaxies being in the upper branch.
Although the absolute metallicity values of our sample in
the intermediate M∗ range match other studies, the slope of
our MZR is different from that of others. Because we prefer a
linear ﬁt, our slope is constant (0.30 ± 0.02) across the 3-dex
range of the M∗. This result appears in contrast to the “sat-
uration” of metallicities in massive galaxies found by other
authors, e.g., M08, Zahid et al. (2013), and de los Reyes et al.
(2015), who found that the slope of MZR decreases signiﬁ-
cantly as M∗ increases. The different slopes between our and
other studies at the massive end could be attributed to a few
reasons.

First, we do not have enough massive galaxies at M∗>
1010.5M⊙ to constrain the slope at the massive end (only
19 in our whole sample). Second, the slope of the mas-
sive end is sensitive to AGN removal. AGN contamina-
tion would bias the average metallicity of massive galax-
ies toward lower values, because the strong [OIII] emission
of AGN host galaxies would make the galaxies resemble a
low-metallicity galaxies with higher [OIII]/Hβ. We use the
mass-excitation method to exclude both X-ray and non-X-
ray AGN, but some studies, e.g., Zahid et al. (2013), only
exclude X-ray AGN (see Appendix B for detailed discus-
sions of AGN removal). Third, the analytic functions used
to ﬁt the MZR are different. Other studies use second-order
polynomial functions (M08 and de los Reyes et al. (2015)) or
power-law (Zahid et al. 2013) to ﬁt the MZR in logarithmic
space. As show in Table 2, the second-order polynomial ﬁts to
our [OIII]/Hβ “upper+lower z” and [OIII]/[OII] MZRs have
c2 < 0, indicating a slight “saturation” at M∗> 1010.5M⊙.
These polynomial ﬁts (red and green dashed lines in Panel
(d)) actually match the MZR of M08 and de los Reyes et al.
(2015) very well.

At the low-mass end, we ﬁnd a high average metallic-
ity compared to the extrapolation of other MZR relations to
M∗∼ 108M⊙ (blue and green dashed lines in Panel (b) of Fig-
ure 5). The slope and normalization of our MZR at the low-
mass end do not signiﬁcantly depend on the choice of ﬁtting
functions. Other studies have almost no data at M∗< 109M⊙
to constrain the slope at the low-mass end. The good agree-
ment between our MZR and that of H13 at the low-mass end
(Panel (d) of Figure 5) provides reassurance to our measure-
ment. We therefore believe that simply extrapolating other

Dwarf Metallicity

9

MZRs to the low-mass regime would underestimate the aver-
age metallicity of galaxies with M∗< 109M⊙.

Our sample selection would not bias our MZR at the low-
mass end. As shown in Section 2, our sample is quite repre-
sentative in terms of SSFR and U-B color at a given M∗ down
to M∗∼ 109M⊙. Below that, our sample is biased toward
galaxies with higher SSFR (and hence bluer color).
If the
local SFR dependence, i.e.,at a given M∗, lower SFR galax-
ies having higher metallicity, is also found in our sample, we
would expect that our average metallicity at M∗< 109M⊙
is underestimated instead of overestimated, which suggests
that the true MZR may be even ﬂatter than ours if the strong
SFR dependence found in the local universe also holds at
0.5 < z < 0.7. As shown in Section 4.3, however, we only
ﬁnd a very weak SFR dependence of metallicity in our sam-
ple, which would not signiﬁcantly bias our MZR measure-
ment. In fact, detailed tests in Appendix A show that sample
selection (in SSFR and emission-line S/N) has no signiﬁcant
effects on our derived MZR. Our sample selection would bias
the MZR toward higher metallicity only if a positive SFR de-
pendence, i.e., galaxies with higher SFR having higher metal-
licity (Ly et al. 2014a), holds at 0.5 < z < 0.7.

Local galaxies are shown to follow a fundamental metal-
licity relation (Mannucci et al. 2010, 2011):
at a given
M∗, galaxies with higher SFR have lower metallicity, and
vice versa. The M∗–SFR–metallicity surface (or funda-
mental metallicity plane, FMR) can be collapsed to a two-
dimensional space by relating metallicity to a linear combi-
nation of M∗ and SFR. Mannucci et al. (2011) demonstrate
that metallicity correlates tightly with the quantity µ0.32 =
log(M∗) − 0.32 ∗ log(SF R) (in solar units) down to M∗∼
109.2M⊙. To test the SFR dependence of the MZR in our
sample, we measure the median metallicity of each (M∗,
SSFR) bin and show the results in Figure 6. At a given M∗,
SSFR and SFR are equivalent. We choose the SSFR–M∗
space rather than the SFR–M∗ space, because the former is
used to show our sample selection effect in Section 2. The ﬁg-
ure is similar to and enables an easy comparison with the rep-
resentation of metallicities in the color-coded SSFR–M∗ dia-
gram in Maier et al. (2015) (their Figure 4). We use the upper-
branch [OIII]/Hβ-derived metallicities of all DEEP3+TKRS

and DEEP2 galaxies for this test. Since we only present the
median metallicity, given the small fraction of lower-branch
galaxies (<30% in even the lowest M∗ bin), not identifying
lower-branch galaxies would not affect the median metallici-
ties.

The SSFR (or SFR) dependence of metallicity in our sam-
ple is weak. Our strongest signal is from galaxies with
108.5M⊙<M∗<109.5M⊙. In this regime, the metallicity de-
creases by at most 0.15 dex when log(SSFR/yr) increases
from -10 to -8. As a comparison, Mannucci et al. (2010) (see
their Fig. 6) ﬁnd that for local galaxies at the same M∗ range,
the metallicity changes by 0.3 dex from log(SSFR/yr)=-10 to
-9 and would change by ∼0.6 dex from log(SSFR/yr)=-10 to
-8 with extrapolation.

Our result is consistent with that of de los Reyes et al.
(2015) and P´erez-Montero et al. (2013), both in favor of a
moderate or no SFR dependence of the MZR at similar red-
shifts. In contrast, some other studies (e.g., Cresci et al. 2012;
Maier et al. 2015) ﬁnd a SFR dependence at z ∼ 0.7 as strong
as in local galaxies (i.e., a non-evolved FMR between z ∼ 0
and z ∼ 0.7). The discrepancy indicates the uncertainty of the
existence of a fundamental metallicity relation beyond the lo-
cal universe. The weaker SFR dependence could be a physical
phenomenon at intermediate redshift, suggesting that galaxies
need time to establish the SFR dependence of their metallicity.
This speculation is consistent with the results at even higher
redshifts from Steidel et al. (2014), Sanders et al. (2015), and
Grasshorn Gebhardt et al. (2015), who ﬁnd no SFR depen-
dence of the MZR at z∼2. But the lack of SFR dependence
could also be due to selection effects. Mock observations by
using local galaxies with strong SFR dependence to mimic
high-redshift observations are needed to test the selection ef-
fects (Salim et al. 2015).

5. SCATTER OF THE MZR

Our ∼10-fold gain in sample size enables a solid study of
the scatter of the MZR at the low-mass end at 0.5 < z < 0.7
for the ﬁrst time. Figure 7 shows the scatter of the MZR of
our sample. We deﬁne the scatter as the half width between
the 84 and 16 percentiles (P84 and P16) of the metallicity dis-
tribution at a given M∗.

and

for our

[OIII]/Hβ-derived

We measure the scatter

(1)
four MZRs:
z”,
DEEP3+TKRS
“upper+lower
(3)
(2) DEEP3+TKRS [OIII]/Hβ-derived “upper Z”,
(4) DEEP2
DEEP3+TKRS [OIII]/[OII]-derived,
[OIII]/Hβ-derived.
The results are shown by different
symbols in Figure 7. The DEEP3+TKRS [OIII]/Hβ-derived
“upper Z” scatter can be treated as a lower limit of the MZR
scatter, because putting all galaxies in the upper branch
artiﬁcially reduces the MZR scatter. The DEEP3+TKRS
[OIII]/Hβ-derived “upper+lower z” scatter shows a signif-
icant upward jump at M∗< 109M⊙, which is an artiﬁcial
result of the metallicity gap seen in Panel (a) of Figure 5. We
only measure the DEEP2 scatter at M∗& 109M⊙, where we
believe the effect of lower branch is negligible. The DEEP2
scatter agrees with the two [OIII]/Hβ-derived DEEP3+TKRS
scatter. The [OIII]/[OII]-derived DEEP3+TKRS scatter is
about 0.1–0.15 dex higher than others. This large discrepancy
is due to the larger uncertainty of our [OII] measurement
than [OIII] and Hβ, because in addition to the spectra
S/N, [OII] also includes the uncertainty (both random and
systematic) of dust extinction E(B-V) measurements. The
typical uncertainty of E(B-V) in our SED-ﬁtting is about
0.1–0.15 mag.

FIG. 7.— Scatter of the MZR of our sample. Scatter is deﬁned as the half-width between the 84 and 16 percentiles (P84 and P16) of the metallicity distribution
at a given M∗. Left (a): Observed scatter. Measurements from different samples and/or different methods of breaking the lower–upper branch degeneracy
are plotted with different symbols as the labels show. We only measure the scatter of DEEP2 down to M∗=109M⊙. The solid black line shows the scatter
of Zahid et al. (2011) at z ∼ 0.8 from DEEP2 data. Right (b): Intrinsic scatter. The measurement uncertainties are subtracted from the observed scatter in
quadrature. Symbols have the same meaning as in Panel (a). A third-order polynomial function is ﬁtted to our measurements: red squares, green circles, and
purple diamonds at M∗≥ 109M⊙ and only green circles at M∗≤ 109M⊙. The scatter of local MZRs of Tremonti et al. (2004) and Zahid et al. (2012) are
shown by solid and dashed black lines. The scatter from the initial and improved guesses of Forbes et al. (2014b) are shown by dashed–dotted and dotted gray
lines. The scatter of numerical simulations of Dav´e et al. (2013) is shown by the solid gray line.

Our [OIII]/Hβ-derived scatter is slightly smaller than that
of Zahid et al. (2011) at 109.5M⊙<M∗< 1010.5M⊙ by ∼0.03
dex. We do not correct for the measurement uncertainty for
both studies. Zahid et al. (2011) measure the MZR of DEEP2
galaxies at z ∼ 0.8. Since the data of their and our studies are
quite similar in terms of instrument, resolution, and exposure
time, the agreement (albeit the small difference) reassures us
the accuracy of our scatter measurement. But our sample
extends the scatter measurement down to M∗∼ 108M⊙, 10
times below the M∗ limit adopted by Zahid et al. (2011).

The intrinsic scatter of the four MZRs is shown in Panel (b),
with the same symbols as in Panel (a). To obtain the intrinsic
scatter, we subtract the average measurement uncertainty in
quadrature from the observed scatter at each M∗ bin. To unify
the scatter from the four MZRs, we ﬁt a third-order poly-
nomial function to them. We do not include the [OIII]/Hβ-
derived DEEP3+TKRS “upper Z” scatter, because it serves as
the lower limit. We also do not include the [OIII]/Hβ-derived
DEEP3+TKRS “upper+lower z” scatter at M∗< 109M⊙, be-
cause it is affected by the metallicity gap of breaking the
degeneracy. These exclusions leave the [OIII]/[OII]-derived
DEEP3+TKRS scatter as the only constraint at M∗< 109M⊙.
The intrinsic scatter increases as M∗ decreases. The scat-
ter starts as <0.1 dex at M∗> 1010M⊙, gradually increases
to 0.15 dex at M∗∼ 109M⊙, and then quickly increases to
0.3 dex at M∗∼ 108M⊙. The dramatic increase at the low-
mass end is boosted by the long tail of very low metallicity
galaxies (Panel (b) of Figure 5). This low-metallicity tail also
indicates that the metallicity distribution at the low-mass end
is skewed toward low-metallicity galaxies (see Zahid et al.
2012, for similar result of local galaxies).

We compare the scatter of our MZR (the best ﬁt one, i.e.,
the red solid line in Panel(b)) to that of other studies (also
measured as (P84-P16)/2). When comparing with the scat-
ter of local MZRs, we assume the metallicity measurement
uncertainty in the studies of local galaxies is negligible com-
pared to the MZR scatter (e.g., Zahid et al. 2012). Therefore,
we do not correct for the measurement uncertainty for their
scatter. Tremonti et al. (2004) measure the scatter of the lo-
cal MZR of ∼50,000 galaxies. Their scatter (solid black line
in Panel (b)) matches ours excellently from M∗=108M⊙ to
M∗=1010.5M⊙. Zahid et al. (2012) re-visit the scatter of local
galaxies by using ∼20,000 SDSS galaxies plus ∼800 DEEP2
galaxies to explore the faint luminosity regime. Their scatter
matches that of Tremonti et al. (2004) and ours very well at
M∗< 109.5M⊙, but their scatter decreases faster than ours
when M∗ increases. One possible reason of their smaller
scatter is that, as Zahid et al. (2012) argued, their [NII]/Hα-
derived metallicity is saturated at high metallicities.

Overall, we present the ﬁrst measurement of the scatter of
the MZR down to M∗∼ 108M⊙ at 0.5 < z < 0.7. The
scatter increases as M∗ decreases, due to an increase in a low-
metallicity tail of galaxies. The scatter of the MZR shows no
evolution from z ∼ 0.7 to z ∼ 0, especially for low-mass
galaxies. We will discuss in Section 6.5 on the use of the
scatter to shed light on the formation mechanisms of low-mass
galaxies.

6. COMPARING MODELS TO OBSERVATIONS

6.1. Calibration Uncertainties

The uncertainty of the metallicity calibration needs to be
taken into account when we compare models to observations.

Dwarf Metallicity

11

In this paper, to map the measured emission line ratios to
metallicities, we use the M08 calibration. There are, how-
ever, about a dozen calibrations available in the literature.
Kewley & Ellison (2008) show that, for local galaxies, the
MZRs derived using different calibrations show signiﬁcant
discrepancy, with the normalization at the massive end vary-
ing by 0.7 dex. Currently, it is not clear which of the cali-
brations is the most accurate one, therefore, using any single
calibration to derive the MZR for comparison with models
does not include the uncertainty in the calibration of mapping
line ratios to metallicities.

To explore the effect of the calibration uncertainty, we con-
vert our ﬁducial MZR from the M08 calibration to the other
seven calibrations discussed in Kewley & Ellison (2008). Al-
though Kewley & Ellison (2008) does not provide the conver-
sion from M08 to others, since M08 uses KD02 for its up-
per branch calibration, we use the conversion between KD02
and others in Kewley & Ellison (2008) for this purpose. The
converted MZRs show a signiﬁcantly large discrepancy (gray
shaded areas in Figure 8). The discrepancy of the normaliza-
tion is small (∼0.1 dex) at the low-mass end, but large (∼0.4
dex) at the massive end. We also show the calibration un-
certainty for the slope of the MZR in Panel (a) of Figure 8.
The smallest discrepancy of the slope (gray area in Panel (a)
of Figure 8) occurs around M∗∼ 1010M⊙, while the discrep-
ancy at the low-mass end is large.

6.2. Comparisons with Different Models

6.2.1. Simple Scaling Relation: Dekel & Woo (2003)

Dekel & Woo (2003) present a simple model to study the
role of feedback in establishing basic scaling relations of low-
surface brightness and dwarf galaxies. In an instantaneous-
recycling approximation, the model assumes that the amount
of metal produced in a gas-rich galaxy is proportional to the
fraction of gas that makes stars in the disk: Z ∝ ηgas ≡
M∗/Mgas. The model also assumes that the supernova en-
ergy required to heat the gas is proportional to the ﬁnal M∗:
ESN = 1
2 MgasV 2 ∝ M∗, where V is the Virial velocity. V is
related to the dynamical mass of the system via: V ∝ M 1/3
dyn.
Combining all above relations, one gets:

Z ∝ ηgas ∝ M∗/Mgas ∝ V 2 ∝ M 2/3
dyn.

(2)

In a gas-rich system, Mdyn ∼ Mgas, so M∗/Mgas ∝ M 2/3
dyn
yields Mdyn ∝ M 3/5

, in which case

∗

Z ∝ M 2/5

∗

(3)

— an MZR with a slope of 0.4 in logarithmic space.

The MZR slope of this idealized model (light brown line
in Panel (a) of Figure 8) is slightly steeper than the slope
of our best-ﬁt linear MZR (red line and dark green band).
The agreement indicates that supernova feedback could play
a primary role in determining the mass–metallicity scaling re-
lation for low-surface brightness and dwarf galaxies. This
model is, however, not valid for high luminosity and high-
surface brightness galaxies (e.g., M∗> 1010M⊙), for which
Dekel & Woo (2003) argues Z ∼ constant.

6.2.2. Slope of the MZR in Equilibrium Models: Dav´e et al.

(2012)

Recently, equilibrium models (e.g., Finlator & Dav´e 2008;
Dav´e et al. 2011b,a, and D12) provide a simple and effective

way to understand the connections between galaxy scaling
relations and physical parameters. These models are con-
structed based on an assumption of the equilibrium between
gas inﬂow, consumption, and outﬂow. In these models, metal-
licity can be written as (D12):

Z =

y

1

1 + η

1 − αZ

,

(4)

where y is the oxygen yield, η is the mass loading factor of
outﬂows, and αZ = Zin/ZISM is the ratio of the metallicities
of infalling gas and the ISM. Oxygen abundance is then

12 + log(O/H) = 12 + log(Z) − log(

3
4

MO
MH

)

= log(y) − log(1 + η) + log(

1

1 − αZ

) + C,

(5)

(6)

where MO and MH are the atomic mass of oxygen and hy-
drogen, respectively, and C is a constant.

To derive the absolute value of metallicity, the value of yield
y is necessary 2. The value depends on the age, metallic-
ity, and IMF of the stellar population as well as nucleosyn-
thetic models. In current models, the oxygen yield is between
0.008 < y < 0.021 (Finlator & Dav´e 2008). This range trans-
lates into an uncertainty of 0.3 dex in the predicted metallic-
ity, which makes the comparison of the absolute MZRs dif-
ﬁcult. Therefore, we only compare the slope of the MZRs
here. Some authors use y as a free parameter to normalize
the MZR. This should be done with caution, because once the
age, metallicity, and IMF of stellar population is ﬁxed, the
yield is also ﬁxed, and varying the yield means leaking (or
producing) a fraction of metal to (or from) nowhere.

The slope of the MZR in equilibrium models can be re-

expressed in terms of the halo mass (Mhalo) as

βMZR =

∂(OH)

∂x

=

∂(OH)

∂xh

×

∂xh
∂x

,

(7)

where (OH) = 12 + log(O/H), x = log(M∗/M⊙), and
xh = log(Mhalo/M⊙). The term ∂xh/∂x ≡ Υ is deter-
mined by the Mhalo–M∗ relation (e.g., Moster et al. 2010;
Behroozi et al. 2013) and absorbs all dependence of Z on M∗.
We can now parameterize both η and αZ as a function of
Mhalo only. Following D12, we have

η = (10xh/1012)−γ,

(8)

where γ = 1/3 for the momentum-driven wind and γ = 2/3
3, we as-
for the energy-driven wind. For the term with αZ
sume

log(

1

1 − αZ

) = (0.5 − 0.1z)(10xh/1012) at xh < 12 (9)

2 There are two types of the deﬁnition of y. First, Searle & Sargent (1972)
deﬁned y as the rate of metals produced and ejected divided by the NET
rate at which H is removed from the ISM. Then, Tinsley & Larson (1978)
deﬁned y as metals ejected per unit mass of new stars formed. Basically,
the former deﬁnes y as metal mass returned per unit long lived stars formed
(stellar mass), while the latter deﬁned y as metal mass returned per unit star
formation. In the equilibrium models discussed later, the second deﬁnition is
used.

3 In D12, αZ is expressed as a function of M∗. Here we re-deﬁne it as
a function of Mhalo because all M∗ dependence is absorbed by Υ. Also,
there is an error in the αZ deﬁnition in D12. The correct formula should be
log(1/(1 − αZ )) = (0.5 − 0.1z)(M∗/1010M⊙)0.25 (R. Dav´e, private
communication). Equation (9) of H13 used the incorrect formula by follow-
ing D12.

12

and

log(

1

1 − αZ

) = (0.5 − 0.1z) at xh ≥ 12.

(10)

It is important to note that this parameterization of the αZ
term is a crude approximation of the result of Dav´e et al.
(2011a).

Combining above equations, we have an expression of

βMZR:

βMZR = [γ

η

1 + η

for xh < 12 and

+ ln(10)(0.5 − 0.1z)10(xh−12)]Υ (11)

for xh > 12.

When xh ≪ 12, η ≫ 1 and 10(xh−12) ≪ 1, we have
βMZR ∼ γΥ. In this mass regime, Υ ∼ 0.5 (see the Mhalo–
M∗ relation of Moster et al. (2010)), so βMZR ∼ 0.5γ. For
a momentum-driven wind, βMZR ∼ 0.17, and for an energy-
driven wind βMZR ∼ 0.33. The latter shows an excellent
agreement with our best-ﬁt linear MZR (0.30 ± 0.02).

When xh ≫ 12, η ∼ 0, so βMZR ∼ 0, implying a constant
Z for very massive galaxies, consistent with the argument of
Dekel & Woo (2003).

Between the two extreme cases (e.g., 11 < xh < 12), both
the η and the αZ terms contribute to the slope (βMZR). More-
over, as xh increases, the contribution of the αZ term becomes
larger. Therefore, the slope of models depends signiﬁcantly
on the assumed αZ term. Given our crude approximation
here, our comparison in this halo mass (or its corresponding
M∗) range is very uncertain.

In Panel (a) of Figure 8, we show the slopes of different
wind models. The slopes are now calculated numerically with
the M∗–Mhalo relation taken from Moster et al. (2010). At
M∗< 109.5M⊙, the slope of the energy-driven wind model
matches our observation very well. The momentum-driven
wind model predicts a much ﬂatter slope than our best-ﬁt
MZR, although it is still within the metallicity calibration
uncertainty (gray area). At 109.5M⊙<M∗< 1010.5M⊙, the
slopes of all models become abnormally steep. As discussed
above, this is due to the crude approximation of the αZ term.
We cannot draw conclusions on the model comparison in this
mass regime, unless a more realistic parameterization of αZ
is available. At M∗> 1010.5M⊙, the slope is dominated by
the αZ term and sharply drops to a value similar to the slope
at the low-mass end.

6.2.3. Equilibrium Model with MCMC: Mitra et al. (2014)

Mitra et al. (2014) investigated how well a simple equilib-
rium model can match observations of key galaxy scaling re-
lations from z = 2 to z = 0. The metallicity formula in their
paper is similar to our Equation 4:

works.
In all panel, red solid and dashed lines are best-ﬁt linear and
second-order polynomial functions of the DEEP3+TKRS sample, galaxies
in which break their lower–upper branch degeneracy by using [OIII]/[OII]
(“upper+lower Z”). The black dotted lines are the 1σ range of the best linear
ﬁt. The gray shaded area is the calibration uncertainties of different metal-
licity calibrations (Sec. 6.1). Top (a): Slope of the MZRs. Slopes from
theoretical works, as the text shows, are over-plotted against our slopes. The
sharp discontinuity of wind models around M∗= 1010.5M⊙ is due to the
fact that αZ term in Equation 4 becomes abruptly independent on Mhalo at
Mhalo> 1012M⊙. Middle (b): MZRs from Dav´e et al. (2013); Mitra et al.

Bottom (c): Model MZRs of Lu et al. (2015a) are compared with our MZRs.
Blue solid, dashed, and dotted lines are for models with preventative feedback

where ˙Mrecyc is the rate of recycling ejected gases,
˙Mgrav
the gas accretion rate (Dekel et al. 2009), and ζ the preventa-
tive feedback parameters. The key baryon cycling parameters
are η, ζ, and trec (gas recycling timescale). They determine
the free parameters by ﬁtting the model to observed scaling
relations: Mhalo–M∗ SFR–M∗, and MZR via Monte Carlo

Markov Chain (MCMC). Because MZR is the scaling rela-
tion of interest in our paper, we use their best-ﬁt model that
only uses Mhalo–M∗ and SFR–M∗ to constrain free parame-
ters. Each parameter is a function of Mhalo and redshift. Their
best-ﬁt MZR at z = 0.6 is shown in Panel (b) of Figure 8, with
a yield y = 0.0126 taken from Asplund et al. (2009).

Dwarf Metallicity

13

In the M∗ range of 108.5M⊙<M∗< 109.5M⊙, their best-ﬁt
MZR matches the normalization of our MZR. But their model
underestimates metallicity both very low-mass and massive
ends.

At M∗< 108.5M⊙,

the slope of their MZR is about
βMZR ∼ 0.5, steeper than our slope (0.30±0.02). This is
because their best-ﬁt γ in our Equation 8 (called η3 in their
paper) is 1.16, much larger than both the momentum-driven
and energy-driven wind. According to our discussion above,
at xh ≪ 12, βMZR ∼ γΥ. Given Υ ∼ 0.5 and γ = 1.16,
their βMZR ∼ 0.6. The large γ means the mass loading factor
at the low-mass end is too large so large quantities of metals
are ejected out of halos, resulting in low gas-phase metallici-
ties.

At M∗> 109.5M⊙, their MZR becomes ﬂat (βMZR ∼ 0).
Although the “saturation” of metallicity has been reported in
the literature (e.g., Zahid et al. 2013, 2014), it usually hap-
pens at a much higher M∗ (M∗> 1010.5M⊙). As we dis-
cuss above, at M∗> 109.5M⊙, metallicity and βMZR be-
come more dominated by the gas recycling term. A key pa-
rameter in this term is ζ, the preventative feedback parame-
ter. In D12 and Mitra et al. (2014), ζ is contributed by four
sources: photo-ionization, winds, gravitational heating due
to structure formation, and quenching of star-formation. At
109.5M⊙<M∗< 1010.5M⊙, the gravitational heating is the
dominant contribution. Mitra et al. (2014) uses the formula
from the hydrodynamic simulations of Faucher-Gigu`ere et al.
(2011), which do not include metal-line cooling. If the metal-
line cooling is considered, ζ would decreases because the
heating efﬁciency becomes lower, which would result in a
higher metallicity. We suspect that this could be one rea-
son why the model of Mitra et al. (2014) has lower metallicity
than our results at M∗> 109.5M⊙.

Motivated by analytic models (Murray et al. 2005, 2010)
and hydrodynamic simulations (Hopkins et al. 2012) of out-
ﬂows from interstellar medium, Dav´e et al. (2013) use a hy-
brid wind model in their cosmological hydrodynamic simula-
tions: in dwarf galaxies, the energy from SNe plays a dom-
inant role in driving outﬂows, while in larger systems the
momentum ﬂux from young stars and/or SNe is the domi-
nant driver. As a result, the outﬂow scalings switch from
momentum-driven at high masses to energy-driven at low
masses. The transition occurs at galaxy velocity dispersion
σ = 75kms−1 (roughly M∗∼ 109.5M⊙). We show the 15,
50, and 85 percentiles of the metallicities of different runs of
their simulations in Panel (b) of Figure 8.

Interestingly, the MZR of Dav´e et al. (2013) matches our
MZR very well at M∗> 109.5M⊙, but it gradually devi-
ates from ours below M∗= 109.5M⊙. This seems inconsis-
tent with our previous discussion, where we show that the
energy-driven wind in equilibrium models matches the low-
mass end slope of our MZR very well. Similar deviation has
been found when Dav´e et al. (2013) compare their MZR to
that at z = 0 from SDSS (Tremonti et al. 2004), i.e., good
agreement at the massive end, but with a steeper slope than
observed at the low-mass end. A possible reason for the de-
viation from the energy-driven wind in equilibrium model is
that low-mass galaxies in the simulations are not in equilib-
rium, i.e., dMgas/dt 6= 0. Low-mass galaxies grow quite
rapidly. Even with the energy-driven wind, the mass-loading
factor is not large enough to expel enough gas mass to main-

tain an equilibrium. At decreasing halo (or stellar) mass, the
gas reservoir becomes increasingly large relative to what it
would be in equilibrium. This makes the slope of the M-Z
relation steeper than what is expected from the equilibrium
model. Another reason could be the accuracy of the ISM
physics adopted in the simulations. Limited by the numeri-
cal resolution, most of the cosmological hydrodynamic sim-
ulations adopt an approximate (or “sub-grid”) model of ISM
physics, star formation, stellar feedback, and galactic winds.
In these simulations, in order to prevent low-mass galaxies
from forming too many stars, strong outﬂows are usually re-
quired, which would also remove metals from the ISM.

6.2.5. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations: Ma et al. (2015)
To improve the understanding of the physics of star for-
mation and feedback, Ma et al. (2015) study the redshift evo-
lution of the MZR using the high-resolution cosmological
zoom-in simulation FIRE (Hopkins et al. 2014). The reso-
lution (softening factor) of FIRE is 1–10 pc, three orders
of magnitude smaller than that of Dav´e et al. (2013) (∼1
kpc). Such a high resolution allows a realistic characteriza-
tion of the physics of multi-phase ISM, star formation, feed-
back, and galactic winds. FIRE includes prescriptions for a
few feedback mechanisms: (1) momentum ﬂux from radia-
tive pressure; (2) energy and momentum from SN and stel-
lar winds, and (3) photoionization and photo-electric heating.
Ma et al. (2015) includes 22 runs of galaxies with various star-
formation and merger histories.

The slope of the best-ﬁt MZR of FIRE at z = 0.6 (blue
dashed lines in Panel (b) of Figure 8, βMZR = 0.35) shows
good agreement with that of our MZR (βMZR = 0.30±0.02).
The normalization of their MZR, however, is lower than ours
by 0.3 dex. This systematic deviation could be physical or due
to their recipe of calculating the effective metal yield, which,
as previously discussed, would lead to a 2x uncertainty. Even
with this uncertainty, their MZR matches the 1σ conﬁdence
level of our best-ﬁt MZR (black dashed lines), indicating a
statistical agreement.

As stated in Ma et al. (2015), the FIRE galaxies at M∗>
107M⊙are able to retain most of the metals they produced in
the halo. Massive galaxies (M∗> 1010M⊙) are even able to
keep almost all of their metals. This explains why they do not
have a “saturation” of metallicity at the massive end. They
also ﬁnd that outﬂows at outer radii of dark matter halos are
much less metal-enriched than those in the inner radii, sug-
gesting a high efﬁciency of metal recycling.

6.2.6. Preventative Feedback (Lu et al. 2015a)

In many semi-analytic models and simulations, there is
a tension between suppressing star formation and retaining
enough metals in low-mass galaxies. One way to solve it is
to use preventative feedback. In contrast to ejective scenarios
where the effect of feedback is to remove gas from a galaxy
to the IGM, the preventive scenario assumes some early feed-
back to change the thermal state of the intergalactic medium
around dark matter halos so that a fraction of baryons is pre-
vented from collapsing into low-mass halos in the ﬁrst place.
Therefore, in the preventative model, the outﬂow strength
could be much weaker than that in ejective models. The for-
mer would result in a higher gas-phase metallicity.

We compare the predicted MZRs of the preventative and
ejective models of Lu et al. (2015a). The details of the models
are given in Lu et al. (2015b). We ﬁrst compare their ejective

14

Guo et al.

model (Model-EJ in Panel (c) of Figure 8) to our data. The
EJ model captures most of the common features of all ejec-
tive models in the literature. In fact, the EJ model matches the
hybrid-wind numerical simulations of Dav´e et al. (2013) very
well. Both of them match our MZR at M∗> 109.5M⊙, but
deviate from our MZR below M∗= 109.5M⊙ with a steeper
slope. This again demonstrates the common issue of under-
predicting metallicity for low-mass galaxies in most of the
ejective models.

The second model (Model-RI) of Lu et al. (2015a) predicts
a much steeper MZR and signiﬁcantly underpredicts the av-
erage metallicity of low-mass galaxies. This model, as an
extension of the ejective model, allows the ejected gas mass
to reincorporate into the halo hot gas after a period of time.
The reincorporated gas would decrease the gas-phase metal-
licity. Although the MZR slope of this model is much steeper
than our data, it is interesting to see that the predicted metal-
licity is broadly consistent with those lower-branch galaxies
in our sample at 108M⊙<M∗< 109M⊙. This suggests that
those very metal-poor galaxies may have experienced signif-
icant re-infallings of ejected gases. Future works, including
robust measurement of the metal-poor galaxies and more ac-
curate modeling, are required to investigate the formation of
the very metal-poor galaxies.

On the other hand, the preventative model (Model-PR in the
same panel) overpredicts the metallicity of low-mass galax-
ies. Because the main mechanism responsible for keep baryon
mass low in low-mass galaxies is to prevent baryons from col-
lapsing into their host halos, outﬂow in the model is moderate.
Therefore, galaxies in this model retain a larger fraction of
metals. The model predicts a rather ﬂat MZR at z = 0.6, with
the metallicity of low-mass (M∗∼ 108M⊙) galaxies higher
than our data by 0.6 dex.

This result suggests that a pure preventative model cannot
explain the MZR at z = 0.6. Comparing the model predic-
tions with our observational result, we ﬁnd that the observed
MZR sits between the predictions of the Model-EJ and the
Model-PR, suggesting that both ejection and prevention work
together in low-mass galaxies. Observations also show ev-
idence of strong outﬂows (e.g., Rubin et al. 2014), indicat-
ing that ejection works at some level, but the effect of out-
ﬂow in removing Hydrogen mass and metal mass is yet to be
measured quantitatively. Lu et al. (2015a) also shows that the
pure preventative feedback model is able to match the MZR of
z = 0 SDSS galaxies, but overestimates metallicity for z = 2
galaxies. Therefore, the importance of preventative feedback
may also evolve with redshift.

Last but not least, we point out that the predictions made
in Lu et al. (2015a), should be considered as upper limits for
each scenario. The authors assumed that the metallicity of
outﬂow is the same as the gas-phase metallicity of a galaxy.
If the outﬂow material is more metal enriched relative to the
ISM as outﬂow is driven by SNe, which are the sources of
metal, the predicted MZR can decrease.

6.3. Summary of Model Comparisons Using Slope and

Normalization

In this section, we compare our MZR at 0.5 < z < 0.7
to a variety of theoretical works, from simple scaling relation
to the state-of-art numerical simulations. Here we summa-
rize the comparisons using the slope and normalization of the
MZR.

halo

1. Slope. Models (Dekel & Woo 2003; Forbes et al.
2014b, and D12) incorporating SN energy-driven wind
(with mass loading factor η ∝ M (−2/3)
) provide good
agreement with the slope of the MZR of low-mass
(M∗< 109.5M⊙) galaxies. For massive galaxies, the
gas recycling (the αZ term or its analogs) plays an im-
portant role, but the characterization of αZ is uncer-
tain for model comparison. The latest high-resolution
simulation FIRE (Hopkins et al. 2014; Ma et al. 2015),
which has the ISM physics more accurately character-
ized thanks to its high resolution, produces a slope in
good agreement with ours across the whole M∗ range
in our paper.

2. Normalization. With the uncertainty of metal yield y in
mind, we ﬁnd the hybrid-wind simulation of Dav´e et al.
(2013) and the ejective model of Lu et al. (2015a)
match the normalization of our MZR at the massive
end. These models, together with Mitra et al. (2014),
underestimate the metallicity of low-mass galaxies.
One possible solution is to mix preventative (Lu et al.
2015b,a) and ejective feedback for low-mass galaxies.

3. Uncertainties. Our model comparisons are subjected
to uncertainties from both observational and theoretical
sides. The largest uncertainty of observations is the cal-
ibration uncertainty, namely the uncertainty of mapping
emission line ratios to metallicities. Two major uncer-
tainties of theoretical models are the metal yield, which
can be strongly modulated by the metal enrichment of
the outﬂow material relative to the ISM, and the gas re-
cycling term for massive galaxies.

6.4. Using Slope of the MZR to Link to Dark Matter Halos
The observed slope of the MZR could also reveal new
insights in the connection between the luminous (baryonic)
and dark (dark matter halo) sides of galaxy formation. This
connection can be established through simple analytic mod-
els, which usually contain much less parameters than semi-
analytic models and even hydrodynamical simulations. Some
of these parameters are hard to constrain, as discussed in pre-
vious sub-sections. Here, we use the model in Lilly et al.
(2013) to demonstrate the efﬁciency of such analytic models.
The model of Lilly et al. (2013) connects three different
aspects of galaxy formation and evolution: (1) evolution of
SSFR relative to the growth of dark matter halos, (2) gas-
phase metallicities of galaxies, and (3) M∗–Mhalo relation.
In the model, the formation of stars is instantaneously regu-
lated by the mass of gas in a varying reservoir. The gas in the
reservoir is controlled by gas inﬂow into galaxy and outﬂow
expelled from galaxy, the latter of which is in turn scaled with
the SFR.

In the model, gas-phase metallicity is linked to dark matter
halos through fgas, the ratio of the reduced SFR (i.e., SFR
with only long-lived stars counted) to the gas infall rate: Z =
fgasy (assuming the metallicity of inﬂow is negligible), where
y is the yield. This ratio is proportional to the M∗–Mhalo
relation: fgas ∝ M∗/Mhalo. Therefore, the slope of the MZR
Υ)
(Z ∝ M∗
has a relation (which is a rearrangement of Equation (32) and
(34) of Lilly et al. (2013)):

βM ZR) and the Mhalo–M∗ relation (Mhalo ∝ M∗

Υ = 1 − βMZR,

(14)

Dwarf Metallicity

15

where Υ has the same deﬁnition as that used in Equation 11
and 12.

In Section 6.2.2, we simply take Υ ∼ 0.5 from Moster et al.
(2010) to predict model MZR slopes. Here, we explore the
link between the MZR and dark matter halos in the other way:
starting from our observed βMZR and using it to constrain
the M∗–Mhalo relation. Using Equation 14, our observed
βMZR=0.30 yields Υ=0.70. This value is larger than that of
Moster et al. (2010) and hence implies a ﬂatter (M∗/Mhalo)–
Mhalo relation than that in Moster et al. (2010). It is, how-
ever, interesting to note that at Mhalo< 1011M⊙, the slope
of the (M∗/Mhalo)–Mhalo relation in Behroozi et al. (2013) is
indeed ﬂatter than that in Moster et al. (2010) (see Figure 14
in Behroozi et al. (2013)) and quite similar to what inferred
from our Υ=0.7. Our example here simply aims to highlight
the power of using βMZR to constrain the physics of dark
matter halos. Future investigations are needed to better deter-
mine the slope of the (M∗/Mhalo)–Mhalo relation at the very
low-mass end.

6.5. Using Scatter of the MZR to Understand the Formation

of Low-mass Galaxies

The scatter of the MZR is crucial to understand the origin
of the MZR. Relative to the slope and normalization, the scat-
ter of the MZR is barely affected by the calibration uncer-
tainty (e.g., Zahid et al. 2012). Therefore, theoretical work on
modeling the scatter may provide important clues to under-
standing galaxy formation. Here, we use the statistical equi-
librium model of Forbes et al. (2014b) to demonstrate how to
use the scatter to explore the stochastic nature of the forma-
tion of low-mass galaxies.

Although the equilibrium models with energy-driven winds
provide a good explanation of the slope of the MZR at the
low-mass end, its explicit assumption dMgas/dt = 0 may
not be true for all galaxies. For example, Feldmann (2013)
and Forbes et al. (2014a) point out that many galaxies are out
of the equilibrium with dMgas/dt < 0. On the other hand, in
semi-analytic models (e.g., Lu et al. 2014), low-mass galaxies
always increase their gas mass rapidly, namely, dMgas/dt >
0. Moreover, assuming dMgas/dt = 0 for all galaxies only
allows one to derive the ﬁrst-order scaling relations; it cannot
shed light on the origin of the scatter of the scaling relations.
Forbes et al. (2014b) present a simple model to understand
the origin of the scatter in star formation and metallicity of
galaxies at a ﬁxed mass. This model relaxes the key assump-
tion of equilibrium models, namely that the rate at which
baryons enter the gas reservoir varies slowly. Galaxies in
this model have been fed by some stochastic accretion pro-
cess long enough that the full joint distribution of all galaxy
properties has become time invariant. This model can be re-
ferred to as a statistical equilibrium model, because individ-
ual galaxies are not in equilibrium, but the population is. The
scatter of scaling relations arises from the intrinsic scatter in
the accretion rate and also depends on the time-scale on which
the accretion varies compared to the time-scale on which the
galaxy loses gas mass.

Forbes et al. (2014b) use γ = 2/3 (see our Equation 8) for
the mass loading factor, consistent with energy-driven winds,
and they do not include any wind recycling. Given our dis-
cussions in Section 6.2.2, not surprisingly, their MZR slope
(βMZR = 0.348, light green line in Panel (a) of Figure 8)
matches that of the energy-driven wind (0.33). Their slope
agrees with our slope (0.30 ± 0.02) for all M∗ ranges within
3σ level. These results again suggest the importance of SN

feedback on shaping the MZR.

More interesting is to compare the scatter of the MZR in
the models of Forbes et al. (2014b) to our data (Panel (b) of
Figure 7). Forbes et al. (2014b) do not tune their models to
obtain a set of “best-ﬁt” parameters. Instead, they only use
two sets of parameters: initial guess and improved guess. The
difference between the two sets of parameters allows us to
explore the processes responsible for the origin of the scatter
of the MZR. The key parameters that govern the scatter of the
MZR in their model are (1) the scatter of baryonic accretion
rate (σ ˙M ) and (2) the scatter of M∗–Mhalo relation (σSHMR).
The parameters in the initial guess are taken from N-body
simulations of Neistein & Dekel (2008) and Neistein et al.
(2010). The initial guess yields an MZR scatter of 0.16
(dashed–dotted gray line in Panel (b) of Figure 7), which
matches our scatter around M∗= 109M⊙. To produce a scat-
ter smaller than the observed scatter of the local MZR to ap-
proach the intrinsic scatter, Forbes et al. (2014b) adjust their
key parameters by reducing σ ˙M and σSHMR by half. The im-
proved guess yields an MZR scatter of 0.09 (dotted gray line
in Panel (b) of Figure 7), now matching our MZR scatter of
massive galaxies.

The adjustment of the parameters in Forbes et al. (2014b)
has an important implication on the origin of the MZR scat-
ter:
to increase the MZR scatter, one can increase σ ˙M
and/or σSHMR. Galaxies out of (statistical) equilibrium
(dMgas/dt > 0) could also increase the MZR scatter, as ar-
gued by Dav´e et al. (2011b) and Zahid et al. (2012) that the
MZR scatter would be large if the timescales for galaxies to
equilibrate is long (gas dilution time scale is long compared
to the dynamical time scale of galaxies).

Forbes et al. (2014b) predict a constant MZR scatter over
the whole M∗ range in both the initial and improved
guesses, but our observed scatter increases as M∗ decreases.
The difference stems from the assumption in Forbes et al.
(2014b) that both σ ˙M and σSHMR are mass indepen-
dent.
In fact, many current abundance matching methods
use a constant σSHMR in their models (e.g., Moster et al.
2010; Behroozi et al. 2013). There is some evidence of a
mass-independent σSHMR for massive galaxies with M∗>
1010.2M⊙ (Trujillo-Gomez et al. 2011; Reddick et al. 2013),
but σSHMR of low-mass galaxies has not been well con-
strained.

The hybrid-wind simulations of Dav´e et al. (2013) also pre-
dict an increasing scatter towards the low-mass end at z =
0.55 (the solid gray line in Panel (b) of Figure 7). Their scat-
ter matches ours very well for M∗> 109M⊙ galaxies. Be-
low M∗= 109M⊙, their scatter becomes smaller than ours. In
Dav´e et al. (2013), since the baryonic accretion rate is well set
by N-body simulation and their galaxies are probably already
out of equilibrium (see Section 6.2.4), one possible explana-
tion of their small predicted MZR scatter below M∗= 109M⊙
is then their σSHMR is smaller than it should be. An addi-
tional evidence that σSHMR of Dav´e et al. (2013) is under-
estimated is their tighter-than-observed SFR–M∗ relation. In
the data of Dav´e et al. (2013), there are almost no galaxies
with SFR> 1M⊙/yr at M∗< 109M⊙. In contrast, our sam-
ple contains such galaxies (see Figure 1).

The lack of redshift evolution of the scatter of the MZR is
also intriguing. As shown by Panel (b) of Figure 7, our scatter
at z ∼ 0.7 is consistent with that of Tremonti et al. (2004) at
z ∼ 0. This result of no redshift evolution implies that all
the factors that could alter the scatter of the MZR should re-
main unchanged from z ∼ 0.7 to z ∼ 0. Among them, σ ˙M

16

Guo et al.

is particularly interesting. Our results suggest that, although
the cosmic gas accretion rate decreases by a factor of three
during this period (e.g., Dekel et al. 2009), the scatter of the
accretion rate remains unchanged from z ∼ 0.7 to z ∼ 0. Fu-
ture theoretical studies on the redshift evolution of the scatter
of baryonic accretion rate is important to understand the ori-
gin of the scatter of the MZR.

7. CONCLUSIONS

We study the MZR and its scatter at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 0.7 by
using 1381 ﬁeld galaxies collected from previous deep spec-
troscopic surveys. Our sample is fairly representative of nor-
mal star-forming galaxies at the redshift, in terms of SSFR
and color at a given M∗. Moreover, the sample contains 237
galaxies with M∗< 109M⊙, comprising currently the largest
sample in this mass regime (∼10 times larger than previous
ones) beyond the the local universe, which enables an un-
precedentedly strong constraint on the MZR and its scatter
in the low-mass regime.

We ﬁnd a power-law MZR with a slope (in logarithmic
space) of 0.30±0.02 at 108M⊙<M∗< 1011M⊙. Our MZR
shows agreement with other MZRs at similar redshifts in the
literature at M∗> 109M⊙. The slope of our MZR below
M∗∼ 109M⊙ is ﬂatter than the extrapolation of other MZRs.
The SFR dependence of the MZR in our sample is weaker
than that in the local universe. More tests are needed to in-
vestigate the existence of the fundamental metallicity relation
beyond the local universe.

We compare our MZR to several theoretical models, in-
cluding simple scaling relations, semi-analytic models, and
the state-of-the-art numerical simulations. We ﬁnd that mod-
els incorporating SN energy-driven winds (with mass loading
factor η ∝ M (−2/3)
) provide good agreement with the slope

halo

of the MZR of galaxies with M∗< 109.5M⊙.

With the 10-fold gain in sample size, we present the ﬁrst
measurement of the scatter of the MZR down to M∗= 108M⊙
at 0.5 < z < 0.7. The scatter increases as M∗ decreases,
from 0.1 dex at M∗∼ 1010M⊙ to 0.3 dex at M∗∼ 108M⊙.
The scatter of the MZR shows no evolution from z ∼ 0.7 to
z ∼ 0.

Relative to the slope and normalization of the MZR, which
are subjected to both observational and theoretical uncertain-
ties, the scatter of the MZR is the least affected by observa-
tional uncertainties and thus can be used as an important diag-
nostic of the stochastic formation history of low-mass galax-
ies. According to a simple statistical equilibrium model, the
large scatter in low-mass galaxies implies that either σ ˙M or
σSHMR increases as M∗ decreases. The lack of the redshift
evolution of the scatter implies that both σ ˙M and σSHMR re-
main unchanged from z = 0.7 to z = 0.

APPENDIX

A. POSSIBLE SELECTION AND MEASUREMENT

EFFECTS ON OUR MZR

Here we discuss three selection and measurement effects
that may have impacts on our MZR measurement: (1) S/N
cuts on [OIII] and Hβ, (2) our sample bias toward higher-
SSFR galaxies at M∗< 109.5M⊙, and (3) our choice of an Hβ
absorption correction factor of EW = 1 ˚A. We use both the
DEEP3+TKRS “upper+lower z” MZR and the [OIII]/[OII]-
derived MZR as our ﬁducial MZR for the tests. The test re-
sults do not change with the choice of the ﬁducial MZR. For
simplicity, we only show the results of the “upper+lower z”
MZR in Figure 9. We conclude that none of them would sig-
niﬁcantly change the slope and scatter of our MZR.

To investigate the effect of the S/N cuts of emission lines,
we re-calculate the MZR with higher S/N cuts, namely
S/N[OIII],Hβ >5 and 8. The new MZRs in the left panel
of Figure 9 show that neither cut signiﬁcantly changes our
ﬁducial results (with S/N>3). On average, the deviation be-
tween the new (blue and green) and the ﬁducial (red) MZRs
is about 0.05 dex. The only large deviation is found at
108M⊙<M∗< 108.5M⊙ with S/N>8, but the error bar in this
mass regime is also the largest. This result is consistent with
Foster et al. (2012), who also found that varying the selection
criteria of S/N cut or magnitude cut does not signiﬁcantly al-
ter the MZR for a given calibration. Therefore, we conclude

that the S/N cut only induces minor effects on our MZR.

We also investigate the effect of our sample bias on the
MZR. As shown in Figure 1, our sample is biased toward
high-SSFR galaxies at M∗< 109.5M⊙. To derive the MZR
for a mass-complete sample, we assign an [OIII]/Hβ value to
each star-forming galaxy in our parent samples (CANDELS
GOODS-N and IRAC EGS, shown by contours and small
black dots in Figure 1). The assigned value is equal to the
line ratio of its closest galaxy in our ﬁnal sample (red sym-
bols in Figure 1) in the (M∗, SSFR) space. The assumption
here is that the [OIII]/Hβ value is determined by its M∗ and
SSFR. This assignment is feasible because our selected sam-
ple, although biased, actually covers the whole star-forming
main sequence. We then re-calculate the MZR for the whole
parent sample with the assigned line ratios.

The result (middle panel of Figure 9) shows that the bias
in SSFR induces almost no effect on the MZR. This is con-
sistent with our results that the MZR dependence on SSFR is
weak in our sample in Section 4.3, where the most obvious
(but still weak) signal of SSFR dependence of metallicity is
found at 108.5M⊙<M∗> 109.5M⊙ (see Figure 6). Therefore,
we conclude that our sample is representative of star-forming
galaxies for deriving the MZR and its scatter between 108M⊙
and 1011M⊙.

We also test the effect of EW correction for Hβ absorp-
tion. We assume a correction factor of 1 ˚A for our galax-

FIG. 9.— Selection and measurement effects on our MZR measurement. In all panels, red circles with error bars are the median and 16 and 64 percentiles of
the DEEP3+TKRS “upper+lower z” MZR with S/N[OIII]andHβ >3 and Hβ EW correction of 1 ˚A (the same as that in Panel (a) of Figure 5). Left: S/N cut
effect. Blue triangles and green squares show the re-calculated MZRs with S/N[OIII]andHβ >8 and 5, respectively. Middle: Sample bias effect. Blue squares
and error bars show the MZR of re-sampling our DEEP3+TKRS sample to match the SSFR distribution at a given M∗ of our parent samples. This panel tests the
effect of our ﬁnal sample being biased toward slightly high-SSFR galaxies (see Figure 1). Right: Hβ EW correction effect. Blue squares and error bars show the
MZR calculated with Hβ EW correction factor of 3 ˚A.

ies. Some authors, however, found a higher correction factor
(for example, 3 ˚A in Lilly et al. (2003). We re-calculate the
MZR using a correction factor of EW=3 ˚A. The result (right
panel of Figure 9) shows that the metallicity of galaxies with
108.5M⊙<M∗< 1010.5M⊙ is increased by ∼0.1 dex. What’s
important is that although the increase changes the normal-
ization of the MZR, it does not signiﬁcantly change its slope
or scatter. We emphasize that we use the correction of EW=1
˚A as our ﬁducial results, because it is drawn from previous
observations with similar spectral resolution as ours. As dis-
cussed in Zahid et al. (2011), the EW correction factor de-
pends on the spectral resolution. Lower resolution requires
larger correction factors because emission lines are spread
into larger wavelength regions. Also, comparison with pre-
vious MZRs (Panel (d) of Figure 5) also suggest that using
EW=1 ˚A yields a better agreement with previous results in
the literature.

B. EFFECT OF AGN REMOVAL

As discussed in Section 4.2, AGN removal affects the slope
of MZR at the massive end. In this paper, we use the MEx
method of Juneau et al. (2011) to exclude AGN contamina-
tion. Juneau et al. (2011) used the DEEP2 and TKRS spectra
(the same data as used by this paper) to calibrate their method
to achieve a balance between efﬁciency and contamination.
Also, the MEx method is shown remaining effective up to
z = 1.5 (Trump et al. 2013). Therefore, we believe that the
MEx method is the most suitable one for our study. In Fig-
ure 10, we re-calculate the MZR by using other AGN removal
methods and compare the results to our ﬁducial MZR of using
the MEx method.

X-ray is the most reliable way to identify AGNs, but it
is not complete, due to a signiﬁcant (up to 50%) fraction
of Compton-thick AGNs. Therefore, the results of using X-
ray selection should only be treated as a lower limit of AGN
contamination. As shown in Figure 10, X-ray selection re-
moves fewer high-metallicity (i.e., high [OIII]/Hβ) galaxies
at M∗> 1010M⊙than the MEx method does, resulting in an
almost ﬂat MZR at this mass regime. The massive-end slope
is now more consistent with that of Zahid et al. (2013), be-

FIG. 10.— Effect of AGN removal on the MZR measurement. For simplic-
ity, all galaxies are assumed to be in the upper branch, and no conversion un-
certainty is included. Large black circles with error bars show DEEP3+TKRS
galaxies without any AGN removal. MZRs with different AGN removal
methods are shown by different symbols as indicated by the labels. The MEx
method (purple squares) is the ﬁducial method used in our paper.

cause Zahid et al. (2013) also only removed X-ray sources.

AGN removal can also be done with the “Blue BPT” di-
agram (Lamareille et al. 2004; Lamareille 2010) which uses
[OIII]/Hβ vs. [OII]/Hβ to identify AGNs. Compared to the
MEx method, the “Blue BPT” introduces no explicit mass
dependence. It, however, requires measurement of dust ex-
tinction because [OII]/Hβ is reddening dependent. Lamareille
(2010) argues that using EW ratios could alleviate the issue,
but this does not fully remove the reddening-dependence be-
cause stars and gas have different extinction. Figure 10 shows

Guo et al.

that the “Blue BPT” removal results in a very similar MZR to
the MEx (and X-ray) removal at M∗< 1010.5M⊙. At higher
M∗(where small number statistics hits our sample), the “Blue
BPT” result is similar to that of X-ray removal.

Overall, we conclude: (1) X-ray selection provides the most
reliable AGN identiﬁcation, but its identiﬁed AGN sample is
not complete. Line-ratio diagnostics are needed to exclude
Compton-thick AGNs. (2) MEx of Juneau et al. (2011) is de-

ﬁned at z ∼ 0.7 and hence the most suitable method for our
study. (3) “Blue BPT” yield a similar result to X-ray selec-
tion. (4) What’s important is that the three methods result in
almost same MZR at M∗< 1010.5M⊙. This is because AGN
contamination is very little in low-mass galaxies (Trump et al.
2015). Therefore, our main conclusions on both the slope and
scatter of MZR at M∗< 1010.5M⊙ are unaffected by our AGN
removal.
