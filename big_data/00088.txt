We take up the study of integrable structures behind non-planar contributions to scattering amplitudes in N = 4 super
Yang-Mills theory. Focusing on leading singularities, we derive the action of the Yangian generators on color-ordered subsets
of the external states. Each subset corresponds to a single boundary of the non-planar on-shell diagram. While Yangian
invariance is broken, we ﬁnd that higher-level Yangian generators still annihilate the non-planar on-shell diagram. For a
given diagram, the number of these generators is governed by the degree of non-planarity. Furthermore, we present additional
identities involving integrable transfer matrices. In particular, for diagrams on a cylinder we obtain a conservation rule
similar to the Yangian invariance condition of planar on-shell diagrams. To exemplify our results, we consider a ﬁve-point
MHV on-shell function on a cylinder.

Introduction

Over the last decades there was tremendous progress in
the understanding of scattering amplitudes of quantum
ﬁeld theories, in particular for N =4 super Yang-Mills.
For this theory it was found that in addition to super-
conformal invariance, tree level amplitudes, as well as
planar loop-level integrands exhibit dual superconformal
symmetry [1]. Together they combine into a Yangian [2],
a symmetry that also underlies the integrable structure
of the spectral problem [3, 4].

More recently, the authors of [5, 6, 7] observed that
for the examples they studied, non-planar contributions
to the integrand exhibit properties, which in the planar
case are consequences of dual superconformal symmetry.
This is a strong hint that planar integrability implies
constraints on the subleading contributions in the 1/N
expansion. Here we make a preliminary step towards
identifying these symmetries, focusing on leading singu-
larities instead of the full integrand.

Leading singularities are quantities that are obtained
from the loop integrand by localizing all integration vari-
ables by Cutkovsky cuts. They capture the IR structure
of the amplitude and play an important role in the
method of generalized unitarity [8, 9, 10]. As discussed
in [11], all leading singularities can be expressed as on-
shell diagrams. On-shell diagrams are graphs with black
and white trivalent vertices, representing 3-point MHV
and MHV amplitudes. Their internal edges correspond
to on-shell phase space integrations. Due to BCFW re-
cursion relations at tree- [12, 13] and loop-level [14, 15],
planar on-shell diagrams also encode all tree level scat-
tering amplitudes as well as the integrands of planar
loop-level amplitudes.

In the following we use twistor variables W a

i , the
half-Fourier transform of spinor-helicity variables [16].

However, our results are independent of this choice.
When working with the twistor variables above, two
external legs of an on-shell diagram are glued together
by identifying the legs employing a projective delta
function

∆ij =

δ4|4(Wi + αWj) ,

and subsequently integrating over the internal states

(2)

Every on-shell diagram encodes an expression in terms
of a Graßmannian contour integral of the form [11, 17,
18, 19]

A =

dk×nC
Vol[GL(k)] Ω δ4k|4k(C · W) ,

(3)

where Ω is a rational function of the k × k minors of
the k × n matrix C. Here k is the MHV degree and
n the number of particles. While the integrand Ω is
ﬁxed for planar diagrams by Yangian invariance and
simply given by the inverse of the product of all consecu-
tive minors [20, 21], a general expression for non-planar
diagrams is unknown and has to be calculated case-by-
case [19, 22, 23].

In this article we derive symmetries of non-planar
leading singularities (on-shell diagrams) that are in-
herited from the Yangian invariance of their planar
counterparts. Noting that every non-planar on-shell di-
agram can be cut open until it is planar allows us to
deduce the action of the Yangian generators on a given
boundary with a ﬁxed ordering of external states. We
ﬁnd that that non-planar leading singularities are in-
variant under a subset of the Yangian generators (13).

The ﬁrst levels are broken depending on the degree of
non-planarity, which is parametrized by the number
of cut internal edges. Additionally, we derive similar
identities involving integrable transfer matrices which
are related to the Yangian (21). For the special case of
diagrams on a cylinder, we present an exact conserva-
tion law in (18). Finally, we consider a ﬁve-point MHV
on-shell function on a cylinder to exemplify our results.

II Monodromy matrix identities

In the following, we will work in the RTT-realization
of the Yangian which is intimately related to the con-
struction of spin chain monodromy matrices in the
framework of the quantum inverse scattering method.
In this realization all Yangian generators are combined
into such a monodromy matrix, which depends on a
spectral parameter. The individual generators of the
Yangian symmetry can be recovered by expanding in
this parameter. Yangian invariance of the planar on-
shell diagram Ap can then be compactly expressed as a
set of 8 × 8 eigenvalue equations

Let us consider an arbitrary non-planar on-shell dia-
gram Anp, with nnp external particles and MHV degree
knp. By cutting internal edges this diagram can be cast
into a planar diagram Ap. As a consequence, Anp can
be written in terms of this diagram Ap with external
states identiﬁed via (1) and (2),

Anp =

∆CC0 Ap .

C,C0 is a shorthand notation for the projective
integrations (2) over all the cut internal states of Anp
with ∆CC0 = ∆C1C0
as deﬁned in (1).
Schematically, the decomposition (4) is depicted in Fig-
ure 1. The planar diagram Ap has np = nnp + 2ncut
external legs and MHV degree kp = knp + ncut. In gen-
eral the decomposition in (4) is not unique and the
parameters np and kp depend on this choice. In the fol-
lowing, we distinguish among the particles on a single
boundary B of the non-planar diagram Anp and the
remaining external particles of Ap which we label by
R. They include the particles on other boundaries of
Anp as well as the 2ncut particles that become external
when cutting the diagram open, see Figure 1. Initially,
Yangian invariance of the planar on-shell diagram Ap
was shown using Drinfeld’s ﬁrst realization [2]. In this
realization the Yangian is deﬁned via the ﬁrst and sec-
ond level generators and their commutators, imposing
certain Serre relations.

diagram. We only show the surface on which the dia-
gram is embedded. The gray lines indicate a possible
cuts. For the planar diagram we combine the states on
boundaries B0 and B00 together with the cut lines C
and C0 into the ordered set R. The arrows indicate the
ordering of labels.

see [24, 25]. Here the indices take the values a, b =
1, . . . , 8, the complex variable u denotes the spectral
parameter and the eigenvalue in the conventions ﬁxed
below is λ(u) = (u − 1)kpunp−kp. The monodromy ma-
trix MRB can be written as the product of two 8 × 8
monodromy matrices acting on B and R
MRB(u) = MR(u)MB(u) .

(6)
Each of the monodromies yields a realization of the
Yangian separately. They are deﬁned in terms of the
Lax operators Li(u) = u + (−1)beab W b
MB(u) = LB1(u)···LBnB

(7)
with MR(u) correspondingly. The elementary matri-
ces eab form the fundamental representation of gl(4|4),
while the operators W b
i generate the action of the
i ∂a
superconformal group on particle i. Here we introduced
i = ∂/∂W a
i .
the notation ∂a
We now show that identities similar to the Yangian
invariance of the planar on-shell diagram Ap in (5) also
hold for the non-planar diagram Anp. In order to de-
rive those identities we note that the product of two
Lax operators Li for a certain choice of the spectral
parameters is proportional to the identity

i ∂a
(u) ,

i as

M ¯R(1 − u)Ap .

Li(u)Li(1 − u − Ci) = u(1 − u − Ci) .

(8)
In the context of integrable models this property is also
known as unitarity. The central charges Ci = W a
i ∂a
i
vanish when acting on an on-shell diagram. Using the
inversion relation in (8), the planar Yangian invariance
condition (5) can be rewritten as
MB(u)Ap = (−1)kpunB−kp
(1 − u)nR−kp

(9)
Here the Lax operators in M ¯R(u) = LRnR
(u)···LR1(u)
are multiplied in the opposite order compared to (7).
The monodromy matrix on the left-hand side does not
depend on the cut lines. Thus from the deﬁnition of the
non-planar on-shell diagram Anp in (4) we immediately
conclude that
MB(u)Anp = (−1)kp unB−kp
(1 − u)nR−kp

∆CC0M ¯R(1−u)Ap .
(10)
To obtain the action of the Yangian generators on the
boundary B we expand the monodromy in terms of the

spectral parameter u. This yields the Yangian genera-

(11)
see e.g.
[26]. The form of the Yangian generators
(MB
[i])ab can be obtained from the monodromy (7) af-
ter inserting the explicit form of the Lax operators. The
analogous expansion holds for the monodromy M ¯R(u).
Thus, when expanding (10) for u (cid:28) 1 we obtain the ac-
tion of the Yangian generators (MB
[i])ab on the bound-
ary B. We ﬁnd that the action of the ﬁrst kp Yangian
generators is rather complicated
(j − kp)kp−i
(kp − i)!
(12)
for i = 0, . . . , kp. Here (M ¯R
[j])ab denote the Yangian
generators of the monodromy M ¯R(u) involving super-
conformal generators which are inserted into the dia-
gram and (a)n is the Pochhammer symbol. However,
we ﬁnd that the remaining higher levels of the Yangian
generators that act on the boundary B annihilate the
non-planar on-shell diagram Anp, and generate unbro-
ken symmetries,

(13)
Note that the amount of unbroken symmetries in (13)
depends in an interesting way on the degree of non-
planarity and is given by nB − kp. The number of exter-
nal states nB ﬁxes the number of levels of the Yangian
generators and kp = knp + ncut can be regarded as a
measure of non-planarity, as each additional boundary
or handle requires further internal lines to be cut. If
kp ≤ nB, we don’t ﬁnd unbroken symmetries. Here we
did not specify any particular embedding of the diagram,
nor any speciﬁc way of cutting it into a planar one. The
preceding discussion shows that the actual symmetries
are determined by the minimal way to cut the diagram,
and that one should consider all possible embeddings of
the diagram to identify as many symmetries as possible.

III Transfer matrix identities

In the spirit of the quantum inverse scattering
method [27], we deﬁne the transfer matrix as the su-
pertrace over the auxiliary fundamental space of the
monodromy matrix

TB(u) = strMB(u) ,

(14)
see also [28], where this transfer matrix appeared in the
context of on-shell diagrams of form factors. It generates
a set of mutually commuting operators T [i]
B = strM[i]
with i = 1, . . . , nB, cf. (11). In this section we derive
further identities of non-planar on-shell diagrams which
involve the operators T [i]
B . In particular, for the spe-
cial case of diagrams on a cylinder they yield exact
conservation laws.

Figure 2: Cutting an on-shell diagram on a cylinder
into a planar on-shell diagram. We only show the sur-
face on which the diagram is embedded. The gray line
indicates a possible cut. The external states C and C0
arise from cutting internal lines of Acyl. Arrows indicate
the ordering of labels.

Z

First, we specialize (10) to the case of a diagram

with two boundaries. Then the supertrace yields
TB(u)Acyl =

(−1)kpunB−kp

C,C0

∆CC0T ¯CB0C0(1 − u)Ap ,

(15)
(1 − u)nB0 +2ncut−kp
where Acyl denotes an on-shell diagram on a cylinder,
cf. Figure 2. At ﬁrst sight we have not gained anything
in comparison to (10). However, when acting with the
transfer matrix on Acyl we can evaluate the integral
over the internal lines on the right-hand side. We ﬁrst
integrate by parts using

R d3|4W g(W)L(u)f(W)

= −R d3|4W [L(1 − u)g(W)] f(W) ,

i

(16)
which holds for arbitrary functions f and g. Now the
Lax operators LCi and LC0
act on the ∆’s instead of
Ap. The special feature of diagrams on cylinders is that
here, the cyclicity of the supertrace allows to bring the
Lax operators LCi and LC0
into a consecutive order,
T ¯CB0C0 = TC0 ¯CB0. We can now use the identity

(u)LCi(u)∆CiC0

= u(u − 1)∆CiC0

(17)
which is equivalent to the inversion relation in (8). This
removes these Lax operators entirely from the right-
hand side, and the transfer matrix becomes simply
TB0(1 − u) and can be pulled out of the integral. The
integral is then the original diagram on the cylinder,

CC0 ∆CC0Ap, and we ﬁnally ﬁnd

unB

Acyl = (u − 1)kcyl TB0(1 − u)

(1 − u)nB0 Acyl ,
(18)
This result can be understood as a conservation law
or intertwining relation between the two boundaries.
Comparing with (9), we see that that it plays a similar
role as an exact identity for the cylinder as the Yangian
invariance does for planar diagrams. Note in particular
that there is no dependence on the number of cut lines.
Similar to the case of the monodromy in Section II,
we use (18) to obtain further identities for general non-
planar on-shell diagrams. Again we consider an arbitrary

Acyl =R
ukcyl TB(u)

on-shell diagram Anp. This time we decompose it only
up to a diagram on a cylinder such that

Anp =

∆CC0 Acyl .

(19)

Z

C,C0

The on-shell diagram on the cylinder Acyl satisﬁes (18).
Here we take B to be an actual boundary of Anp. The
other boundary B0 of Acyl contains the other bound-
aries of the initial diagram as well as the cut lines Ci,
C0
i. Integrating this identity over the cut lines as in (19)
we get
TB(u)Anp = (−1)kcyl unB−kcyl
(1 − u)nB0−kcyl

∆CC0T ¯B0(1−u)Acyl ,
(20)
By arguments identical to those used in Section II,
we can expand in the spectral parameter and identify
powers where the right-hand side of (20) vanishes:

Z

C,C0

B Anp = 0 ,
T [i]

i = kcyl + 1, . . . , nB .

(21)

Note that although (21) looks like the supertrace of (13),
the crucial diﬀerence lies in the number of broken levels:
Here kcyl refers to the MHV degree after cutting to
a cylinder, which is smaller than kp the MHV degree
after continuing to cut the diagram to a planar one.
Thus (21) provides additional identities not obtained
from the supertrace of (13).

IV Example: Five-point MHV on a cylinder

In this section we exemplify and validate the symme-
tries derived in Section II and III for a ﬁve-point MHV
diagram with knp = 2 on a cylinder as depicted in
Figure 3.
While particle “5” belongs to one boundary B0 = (5),
the remaining particles are on the other boundary
B = (1, 2, 3, 4). As discussed in [19], the integrand of the
Graßmannian integral corresponding to this diagram
Acyl can be written as

Ωcyl =

1

(12)(23)(34)(41)

(13)

(35)(51) .

(22)

Here (ij) denotes 2 × 2 minor with respect to the ith
and jth column of the k × n matrix C, cf. (3).

Let us ﬁrst look at the action of the Yangian gener-

ators M[i] ab

B , generated by the monodromy
MB(u) = L1(u)L2(u)L3(u)L4(u) ,

(23)

on the particles at boundary B. As discussed in Sec-
tion II, we can decompose the non-planar diagram Acyl
using the cutting procedure (4). When minimally cut,
the planar diagram Ap has np = 7 external particles
and MHV degree kp = 3 as shown in the right-hand
side of Figure 3.

Figure 3: A ﬁve-point MHV diagram on a cylinder,
and the planar diagram obtained after cutting along the
indicated line.

i=1

B = (−1)ab+c+d+e(W a

Note that other possibilities to cut the diagram via a
single edge are equivalent due to cyclic symmetry on
the boundary, while cutting two edges does not yield
any identity. As nB = 4, we ﬁnd that the fourth level of
the Yangian generators has to annihilate the non-planar
on-shell function Acyl. The Yangian generators of this
level read
M[4] ab

(24)
In order to show that the Acyl is annihilated by the
operator above we proceed in analogy to [21]. After
reordering (24) and acting on the delta function we
obtain

operators g(i) act only on Ω, we ﬁnd
B Acyl = 0 ,

which agrees with (13).
We will now discuss the symmetries as derived in
Section III. Since the diagram Anp is embedded on a
cylinder, the exact transfer matrix identity (18) holds.
In order to check this identity, we note that in our par-
ticular case there is only one particle on the boundary
B0. Thus, due to the vanishing central charge constraint
we trivially ﬁnd

TB0(u)Acyl = strL5(u)Acyl = 0 .

(27)
The evaluation of the action of the transfer matrix
on the particles at the boundary B is more involved.
However, again we can proceed in analogy to [21]. A
straightforward calculation shows that
TB(u)Acyl =

T [i]

B

Note that (28) yields three independent identities when
expanded in the spectral parameter u for the action of

4

T [i]
B with i = 2, 3, 4, cf. (21). Here we did not include
the case i = 0 which identically vanishes as well as i = 1
which trivially holds when acting on a function with
vanishing central charge. The only identity that can be
obtained from (24) by taking the supertrace is the case
i = 4.

The example also shows that one has to consider all
possible embeddings in order to ﬁnd all symmetries, as
brieﬂy discussed at the end of Section II. Note that in
the diagram of Acyl in Figure 3, another embedding on
the cylinder is obtained by simply exchanging particles
“2” and “5”. The integrand (22) is invariant under this
replacement. Therefore the invariance relations (24) and
(28) also hold with the labels “2” and “5” interchanged.

V Conclusions

In this paper we studied the integrable structures in
non-planar contributions to amplitudes in N = 4 su-
per Yang-Mills theory. More precisely, we have shown
that leading singularities of non-planar amplitudes in
the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four
dimensions enjoy Yangian-type symmetries. This is a
direct consequence of the Yangian invariance of their
planar counterparts. We derived the action of the mon-
odromy matrix, and thus the Yangian, as well as the
corresponding transfer matrix on a given boundary of a
given non-planar on-shell diagram. The symmetry gen-
erators realize the same Yangian as in the planar case,
but act on each boundary of the diagram individually.
The lowest levels of these Yangian generators are broken,
depending on the minimal number of internal edges that
have to be cut in order to render the diagram planar.
Additionally, we showed that a similar statement also
holds true for the commuting operators that arise from
the expansion of the corresponding transfer matrix in
the spectral parameter. As an example, we explicitly
constructed the symmetry generators for a ﬁve-point
MHV on-shell function on a cylinder.

It would be important to investigate if our prescrip-
tion yields all unbroken generators when cutting a mini-
mal number of internal edges. Also other ways of decom-
posing the non-planar diagrams or comparing diﬀerent
embeddings may yield further unbroken levels and ad-
ditional constraints. From a mathematical viewpoint,
it would be interesting to investigate the algebra that
results from combining the Yangian-type symmetries
of the diﬀerent boundaries with each other, and with
the superconformal transformations which act on all
external particles.

We hope that the symmetries can be used to deter-
mine integrands of non-planar Graßmannian integrals.
Despite the fact that the Yangian generators are fairly
complicated diﬀerential operators, their action on Graß-
mannian integrals can easily be computed using the
techniques outlined in Section IV. We have seen that in
the example studied here the transfer matrix of length
nB = 4 vanishes when acting on the on-shell function
on the cylinder. Interestingly, the same is true when

acting on the planar ﬁve-point MHV diagram. This sug-
gests that both belong to the same gl(4|4) multiplet. In
principle, such a relation to planar diagrams may exist
for all diagrams on the cylinder with a single leg on one
boundary. It would be interesting to make this relation
more precise and understand if it can be generalized to
more involved conﬁgurations and topologies.

The most pressing question to ask is whether the
symmetries we found manifest themselves in the full
non-planar loop integrands and explain the recent ob-
servations which hint at hidden symmetries similar to
the planar ones [5, 6, 7]. We plan to elaborate on these
open problems elsewhere.

Finally, the key property of on-shell diagrams which
allowed us to deduce their symmetries from those of
the planar ones is the fact that for on-shell diagrams
there is a well-deﬁned cutting and gluing procedure. As
all internal states are on-shell, one can interpret them
as external states of a cut diagram. Our formulation of
the symmetries of on-shell diagrams indicates that it
is possible to systematically identify the implications
of planar integrability for the subleading terms in the
1/N expansion, for quantities where such a procedure
is available. We hope that such a strategy can shed new
light on the study of the integrable structure of non-
planar observables, see e.g. [29]. It would be interesting
to connect these ideas to recent approaches to study
amplitudes and correlation functions [30, 31, 32, 33].
