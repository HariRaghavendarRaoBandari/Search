Abstract

From the theoretical point of view and not being in contradiction with current observational data, the
cosmic strings may have fundamentally diﬀerent origin and are characterized by wide range of energies. The
paper is devoted to the search for possible cosmological observational tests on superstring theory, among
them to the identiﬁcation of observational characteristics to distinguish between cosmological superstring of
diﬀerent types. In the brane-world scenario with an assumption of creation of cosmological superstrings it
was obtained the lower limit on the superstring tension as function of its deﬁcit angle.

1. Introduction

Cosmic strings are one-dimensional objects of the cosmological scales (see [1] and the refs. therein).
These exotic structures are predicted by theory, but has not been found yet [2]. Cosmic strings may be
purely topological entities (endless or inﬁnite, and closed loops), formed as a result of phase transitions in the
vacuum stages of expansion and cooling of the early universe, and hybrid topological and ﬁeld conﬁgurations
(for example, a string with monopols on its end and conglomerates of such elements, so-called ”necklaces”).
It is well-based the cosmological superstring theory as theory of extended objects with astrophysical
characteristics which are the results of a wide variety of interactions of multidimensional spaces [3]. Search
for cosmological superstrings by astrophysical methods requires preliminary assessment of the characteristics
of possible observed candidates on cosmic strings, namely, upper limits on cosmic string linear density. There
are two main groups of methods in putting such the limits.

• String network simulations (see [4] and refs. therein) and search for cumulative restriction for string

angular power spectrum in CMB data, [2];

• Direct search for individual strings, [5] (statement of Canny algorithm for future CMB experiments),

[6] (method based on Haar convolution, i.e. MHF method).

The ﬁrst group of the methods gives the upper limit to estimate the fraction of energy in string with

respect to the total energy of the Universe.

According to the current observational data, [7], there is no reason to assume that the strings have to
manifest themselves in the form of network only. The optical data to analyse the gravitational lens statistics
indicate that (if the strings exist) they should be in small amount. Thus, it becomes important the technique,
which is able to recognize a single string and evaluate its features.

The aim of the paper is to ﬁnd the connections between theoretical parameters of cosmological superstring
with observational data, such as CMB anisotropy induced by a string and its deﬁcit angle. As observational

data there were used the evaluation of the CMB anisotropy found by MHF analysis of Planck data, [6]. The
results can be easily generalized to the more accurate constraints on anisotropy induced by a string.

The paper is organized as follows. In the Section 2 the status of superstrings in modern cosmology is
brieﬂy described. In the Section 3 the warp factor is considered as a parameter which could be in principle
estimated by the known observational string characteristic (string deﬁcit angle). In the fourth (the main)
Section it is discussed the connection between 4D cosmological superstrings and 10D superstrings from
observational point of view.

2. Superstrings as possible cosmological objects

Theoretical studies of cosmic strings become more popular in modern cosmology. Classical topological
strings are of great interest for understanding the processes of phase transitions of the vacuum in the early
universe, to study the relic dark energy, and to study the symmetry violation of fundamental interactions.
Cosmic strings could serve as unique indicators of composition and topological properties of post-inﬂationary
epochs.

The existence of cosmic strings of diﬀerent types, properties and origins are not in contradiction with the
modern observational data on CMB anisotropy. Hybrid cosmic string models become of particular interest
because they are preferred both in terms of simulations [8], and from the point of view of the observational
data on the CMB anisotropy [6]. Interest in the cosmic strings is manifested by the superstring physics as
such objects may be the only observational evidence for superstring models [9].

Firstly superstring have been considered as possible cosmological objects in connection with an under-
standing of the fact that their energy can be signiﬁcantly lower than the Planck one (about 1019 GeV).
Thus, the tension of the cosmological superstrings would be comparable with the observational limits. This
approach is implemented in the representation of brane-world (in a multi-dimensional space-time when addi-
tional spatial dimensions have certain properties). In the 4D space-time fundamental superstring can not be
stretched to the cosmological scale, they ”tear” and will became a system of microscopic superstrings. In the
brane-world scenario an extra dimension reduction provides an existance of superstrings on the cosmological
scales. Let us consider the cosmological model of type II of superstrings, the existing 10D space-time (the
existence of other types of cosmological superstrings is likely in contradiction with the observational data;
see [9] and refs. therein). In string theory the superstrings are not the only size-localized objects. It is not
forbidden a two-dimensional membrane or their analogs of higher dimensions, called p-brane (p is the brane
dimension); so the particle is a 0-brane, the string is 1-brane, etc. In the brane-world model it is introduced
the concept of Dp-branes, which means that the p-brane satisﬁes the initial conditions of Dirichlet-type to
ﬁx the ends (the same way as it is done in the solution of diﬀerential equations in partial derivatives). Thus
in the multi-dimensional space-time there are fundamental closed strings (loops), and fundamental strings
which are ended in the Dp-branes. The model also allows anti-Dp-branes: a brane and an anti-brane have
equal and opposite charges, so they are attracted to each other. More generally, M-theory, too, contains the
brane-world scenario. The common property of these models is that ordinary matter is concentrated on the
hypersurface, the brane immersed in a space-time of higher dimension (called the bulk). Our universe may
be one of such a brane. Gravity can be spread in the bulk (for review, see [10]).

Thus the superstring can naturally appear in brane-world scenario with energies that are comparable

with observational constraints on cosmic string energies.

3. Warp-factor in the 10D space-time

One of the main motivations of brane-world scenario was to explain the large energy gap between Planck
scale of gravity 1019 GeV and electroweak interactions, 102 GeV. The model bases on the warp factor of the
space-time. As in the general relativity the interval is deﬁned

ds2 = dt2

− dx2,

2

in the warp space-time it is introduced the modiﬁed interval:

ds2 = e−A(y)(cid:18)dt2

− dx2(cid:19) − dy2.

The x is a three-dimensional spatial vector, the y is coordinate (or coordinates) of additional compact
dimension, e−A(y) is a positive function of the extra dimension, called warp factor (the function A(y) > 0) .
The physical meaning of this function is that it is the gravitational redshift in a compact extra dimension.
In the simplest case of a 5D space-time the warping is introduced to deﬁne a hierarchy of energy scales.
Thus, gravity, which is distributed in both the bulk and on the brane can have the Planck energy, while
ordinary physics, whose particles and interactions are localized only on the brane, can be characterized by
a much lower energies.

The idea of space-time warping extends to a greater number of additional compact dimensions (6, in the
case of a 10D space-time). In the simplest models, the extra dimensions are spheres or tori, characterized
by A(y) = const. There are more complicated models where warp factor e−A(y) strongly depends on the
coordinate y. Thus, in the so-called throat of multi-dimensional space-time, this function is small, and far
away from the throat is close to unity. For an observer located in the 4D space-time it means that the
observed tension (or linear density) of the cosmological fundamental strings is

µ0 = e−A(y)

· µ,

where µ is deﬁned in 10D space-time. Therefore, the observed energy of the fundamental string could be
much smaller than its energy in 10D space-time.

It is important to note that in the brane-world scenario together with the birth of cosmological super-
strings it could naturally be realized the inﬂation stage of the early universe (see [9]). Inﬂation occurs when
the energy reaches into the so-called throat, i.e., at a low value function e−A(y). Inﬂation is carried out in
the process of annihilation of a brane and an anti-brane. In this process branes and anti-branes of higher
dimensions can produce branes of lower dimensions, including the fundamental strings. The string energy
scale is not Planck one, it is much lower because the strings are created in areas of high warping.

4. Connection between 4D cosmological superstrings and 10D superstrings

The tension of the fundamental strings, observed in the usual 4D space-time, is related to its 10D tension

proportionally to the warp factor:

µ0 = e−A(y)

· µ(10)
p,q .

(1)

Indices p and q represent the number of F- and D-strings respectively. As F-, and D-strings can be generated
during inﬂation in the annihilation process of branes and anti-branes. F- and D-strings can combine to
form one-dimensional cosmological objects called FD-strings (as visual analogy for the case, for example,
p = 1, q = 1 there could be two lines approaching each other at a certain angle, and then twisted with one
another into a single thread).

The cosmic string tension from the point of view of 4D observer depends on the string velosity and on

the temperature amplitude of the CMB, [11], [12]:

Here β is the component of cosmic string velocity, normalized to the speed of light, perpendicular to the line

value of the CMB anisotropy generated by a single cosmic string, [6]. In the Planck unit system ( = c = 1):

inﬂation models on the brane with the warp factor of the order of 10−4, [9], the energetically preferred conﬁguration are those
with the least number of the F - and D-strings.

Table 1: There are presented the values β, obtained by simulation of the dynamics of string networks (there are listed the
authors of the respective papers). From the values of β is calculated the deﬁcit angle (in arcsec), which corresponds to the
anisotropy of 40µK (see text). The ﬁrst and last columns of pairs β and ∆Θ are presented as limiting values that do not
contradict the observational data.

where lp = √G is the Planck length, and ∆Θ = 8πGµ0/c2 is the string deﬁcit angle. The deﬁcit angle is
the angle of the 3D space of the cone, which replaces the 3D Euclidean space of our universe in the presence
of a cosmic string, [4]. From the point of view of an observer the deﬁcit angle is proportional (in the case of
a large cosmic string distance from the observer, asymptotically equal) to the angular distance between the
components of pairs of gravitationally lensed images of distant galaxies lensed by a cosmic string.

Obviously, at diﬀerent velocities β with the same magnitude of the anisotropy (model-independent, ﬁxed
by the results of the processing of radio data space missions WMAP and Planck, [6]), the deﬁcit angle will
be diﬀerent. Simulations of the evolution of a network of cosmic strings allow the value of β of 0.58 (see.

Figure 2: The dependence of the warp factor function A(y) of the additional dimension from the ratio of the Planck length to
the length of the fundamental string r = lp/ls (cross section at diﬀerent ∆Θ of the surfaces in Fig. (1) for p = q = 1). When
the length of the string is much larger than the Planck (model of large extra dimensions), fundamental strings are created
during the inﬂation stage, which corresponds to the warp factor of the order of 10−4 or A(y) ≈ 9. The values of the warp
factor are signiﬁcantly sensitive to observational parameter of a string – deﬁcit angle.

The relation between the string mass and the string tension (linear density) is done by (c =  = 1):

Finally, we obtain a limit on the minimum possible tension of FD-string as follows:

16q2 .

·

Note that the resulting restriction does not depend on the number of F-strings. The expression is consistent
with those of other authors (10−12 < Gµ0 < 10−6, [9]) and reﬁnes them according to the observational data.
For large, but acceptable by observations, deﬁcit angle values (which corresponds to less string velocities)
minimum value of the tension reaches a value of about 10−9.

For strings, moving at about light velocity, the minimum value of tension is about 10−12. Note also that
all previously obtained estimations of cosmic string linear density were based on the cumulative assessment
of the possible contribution of the spectrum of cosmic strings in the spectrum of the CMB anisotropy, while
our estimates are based on an analysis of individual candidates for cosmic strings.

The minimal possible energy of FD-strings’ formation (in GeV) is:

Thus, the allowable range for the tension of the cosmological FD-string is

2′′ (cid:19)2
(cid:18) ∆Θ

10−10
16q2 < Gµ0 < 7.36 · 10−7.

·

The upper limit was obtained recently by MHF method, [6]. Note the dependence of the lower limit
on the observed cosmic string deﬁcit angle. Therefore the main characteristic of cosmological superstring is
no a free parameter, as it was assumed until recently, [9]. Note also the signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the
lower limit of the transition from the q = 1 to all q > 1. Thus, from the observational point of view can
be distinguished the situation of having only one D-string, or many. The lower limit is still small: so for
β = 0.9 the lower limit of Gµ0 = 2.9 · 10−13, and for β = 0.5 the lower limit of Gµ0 = 4.4 · 10−11. With
the growth of q the lower limit obviously decreases. The range for the value of the tension of the resulting
combinations of FD-string is insensitive to the number of F-strings.

7

As it was mentioned above (see. Table 1), for a given value of δT /T (which has been deﬁned by analysis
of CMB anisotropy data, [6]) there is a unique relationship between the string velocity β and deﬁcit angle
∆Θ. For classical strings (not superstrings) deﬁnition by independent methods (for example, by searching
for strings of gravitational lens pairs of distant galaxies) of the string deﬁcit angle allows uniquely restored
its velocity, and its tension µ. In the case of superstrings by knowing the deﬁcit angle, one could restore the
warp factor e−A(y) and determine the creation energy of the strings.

5. Conclusions

The theory of the cosmological string becomes very rich, they could have diﬀerent origin and are char-

acterized by wide range of energies.

Due to new projects on gravitatinal lensing studies and the CMB data analysis some energy bands for
cosmic strings to exist are closing. So, there is less hope to observe so-called light strings (with energies
less than 1015 – 1016 GeV) by CMB data and also by method of gravitational lensing. However, some new
possibilities for strings are opening. The cosmological superstring could be characterized by astrophysical
parameter (the deﬁcit angle of the string).

The ﬁxed value of CMB anisotropy induced by a string and known deﬁcit angle (by gravitation lensing
In the case of cosmological

data) could uniquelly restore the string velocity and string linear density.
superstring one could restore the warp factor and determine the string creation energy.
