Independent Sets in Classes Related to

Chair/Fork-free Graphs

T. Karthick∗

March 16, 2016

Abstract

The Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem on
graphs with vertex weights asks for a set of pairwise nonadjacent ver-
tices of maximum total weight. MWIS is known to be N P -complete in
general, even under various restrictions. Let Si,j,k be the graph con-
sisting of three induced paths of lengths i, j, k with a common initial
vertex. The complexity of the MWIS problem for S1,2,2-free graphs,
and for S1,1,3-free graphs are open. In this paper, we show that the
MWIS problem can solved in polynomial time for (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-
chair)-free graphs, by analyzing the structure of the subclasses of this
class of graphs. This extends some known results in the literature.

Keywords: Graph algorithms; Independent sets; Claw-free graphs; Chair-
free graphs; Clique separators; Modular decomposition.

Introduction

For notation and terminology not deﬁned here, we follow [6]. Let Pn and Cn
denote respectively the path, and the cycle on n vertices. If F is a family
of graphs, a graph G is said to be F-free if it contains no induced subgraph
isomorphic to any graph in F.

In a graph G, an independent (or stable) set is a subset of mutually non-
adjacent vertices in G. The Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem
asks for an independent set of G with maximum cardinality. The Maximum
Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem asks for an independent set

of total maximum weight in the given graph G with vertex weight function
w on V (G). The M(W)IS problem is well known to be N P -complete in gen-
eral and hard to approximate; it remains N P -complete even on restricted
classes of graphs [9, 32]. On the other hand, the M(W)IS problem is known
to be solvable in polynomial time on many graph classes such as: chordal
graphs [12]; P4-free graphs [10]; perfect graphs [14]; 2K2-free graphs [11];
claw-free graphs [28]; fork-free graphs [23]; apple-free graphs [7]; and P5-free
graphs [20].

For integers i, j, k ≥ 0, let Si,j,k denote a tree with exactly three vertices
of degree one, being at distance i, j and k from the unique vertex of degree
three. The graph S0,1,2 is isomorphic to P4 and the graph S0,2,2 is isomorphic
to P5. The graph S1,1,1 is called a claw and S1,1,2 is called a chair or fork.
Also, note that Si,j,k is a subdivision of a claw, if i, j, k ≥ 1.

Alekseev [1] showed that the M(W)IS problem remains N P -complete on
H-free graphs, whenever H is connected, but neither a path nor a subdivi-
sion of the claw. As mentioned above, the complexity status of the MWIS
problem in the graphs classes deﬁned by a single forbidden induced subgraph
of the form Si,j,k was solved for the case i + j + k ≤ 4. However, for larger
i+j +k, the complexity of MWIS in Si,j,k-free graphs is unknown. In partic-
ular, the class of P6-free graphs, the class of S1,2,2-free graphs, and the class
of S1,1,3-free graphs constitute the minimal classes, deﬁned by forbidding
a single connected subgraph on six vertices, for which the computational
complexity of M(W)IS problem is unknown. Also, it is known that there is
an nO(log2 n)-time, polynomial-space algorithm for MWIS on P6-free graphs
[21]. This implies that MWIS on P6-free graphs is not N P -complete, un-
less all problems in N P can be solved in quasi-polynomial time. On the
other hand, MWIS is shown to be solvable in polynomial time for several
subclasses of Si,j,k-free graphs, for i + j + k ≥ 5 such as: (P6, triangle)-free
graphs [5]; (P6, K1,p)-free graphs [27]; (P6, C4)-free [2, 29]; (P6, diamond)-
free graphs [30]; (P6, banner)-free graphs [16]; (P6, co-banner)-free graphs
[31]; (P6, S1,2,2, co-chair)-free graphs [19]; (S1,1,3, banner)-free graphs [18];
and (S1,2,2, bull)-free graphs [18]. It is also known that the MIS problem
can be solved in polynomial time for some subclasses of Si,j,k-free graphs
such as: S1,2,k-free planar graphs and S1,k,k-free graphs of low degree [22],
and S2,2,2-free sub-cubic graphs [25]; and see [13, Table 1] for several other
subclasses. See Figure 1 for some of the special graphs used in this paper.
In this paper, we show that the MWIS problem can be eﬃciently solved in
the class of (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair)-free graphs by analyzing the structure of
the subclasses of this class of graphs. This result extends some known results

2 Notation and terminology

Let G be a ﬁnite, undirected and simple graph with vertex-set V (G) and
edge-set E(G). We let |V (G)| = n and |E(G)| = m. For a vertex v ∈ V (G),
the neighborhood N (v) of v is the set {u ∈ V (G) | uv ∈ E(G)}, and the closed
neighborhood N [v] is the set N (v)∪{v}. The neighborhood N (X) of a subset
X ⊆ V (G) is the set {u ∈ V (G) \ X : u is adjacent to a vertex of X}.
Given a subgraph H of G and v ∈ V (G) \ V (H), let NH(v) denote the
set N (v) ∩ V (H), and for X ⊆ V (G) \ V (H), let NH(X) denote the set
N (X) ∩ V (H). For any two subsets S, T ⊆ V (G), we say that S is complete
to T if every vertex in S is adjacent to every vertex in T .

A hole is a chordless cycle Ck, where k ≥ 5. An odd hole is a hole C2k+1,

where k ≥ 2.

The k-apple is the graph obtained from a chordless cycle Ck of length

k ≥ 4 by adding a vertex that has exactly one neighbor on the cycle.

The diamond is the graph K4 − e with vertex-set {v1, v2, v3, v4} and

edge-set {v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, v4v1, v1v3}.

The co-chair is the graph with vertex-set {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} and edge-
set {v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, v4v1, v1v3, v4v5}; it is the complement graph of the
chair/fork graph (see Figure 1).

A vertex z ∈ V (G) distinguishes two other vertices x, y ∈ V (G) if z is
adjacent to one of them and nonadjacent to the other. A set M ⊆ V (G) is
a module in G if no vertex from V (G) \ M distinguishes two vertices from
M . The trivial modules in G are V (G), ∅, and all one-vertex sets. A graph
G is prime if it contains only trivial modules. Note that prime graphs on at
least three vertices are connected.

A class of graphs G is hereditary if every induced subgraph of a member
of G is also in G. We will use the following theorem by L¨ozin and Milaniˇc
[23].

Theorem 1 ([23]). Let G be a hereditary class of graphs.
If there is a
constant p ≥ 1 such that the MWIS problem can be solved in time O(|V (G)|p)
for every prime graph G in G, then the MWIS problem can be solved in time
O(|V (G)|p + |E(G)|) for every graph G in G.
(cid:3)

Let C be a class of graphs. A graph G is nearly C if for every vertex v
in V (G) the graph induced by V (G) \ N [v] is in C. Let αw(G) denote the
weighted independence number of G. Obviously, we have:

αw(G) = max{w(v) + αw(G \ N [v]) | v ∈ V (G)}.

(1)

Thus, whenever MWIS is solvable in time T on a class C, then it is solvable
on nearly C graphs in time n · T .

A clique in G is a subset of pairwise adjacent vertices in G. A clique
separator (or clique cutset) in a connected graph G is a subset Q of vertices in
G which induces a complete graph, such that the graph induced by V (G)\Q
is disconnected. A graph is an atom if it does not contain a clique separator.

We will also use the following theorem given in [18].

Theorem 2 ([18]). Let C be a class of graphs such that MWIS can be solved
in time O(f (n)) for every graph in C with n vertices. Then in any hereditary
class of graphs whose all atoms are nearly C the MWIS problem can be solved
in time O(n2 · f (n)).
(cid:3)

The following notation will be used several times in the proofs. Given a
graph G, let v be a vertex in G and H be an induced subgraph of G \ {v}
such that v has no neighbor in H. Let t = |V (H)|. Then we deﬁne the
following sets:

Q = the component of G \ (V (H) ∪ N (V (H))) that contains v,
Ai = {x ∈ V (G) \ V (H) | |NH(x)| = i} (1 ≤ i ≤ t),
A+
i = {x ∈ Ai | N (x) ∩ Q 6= ∅},
A−
i = {x ∈ Ai | N (x) ∩ Q = ∅},
A+ = A+

t and A− = A−

1 ∪ · · · ∪ A+

1 ∪ · · · ∪ A−
t .

So, N (H) = A+ ∪ A−. Note that, by the deﬁnition of Q and A+, we have
A+ = N (Q). Hence A+ is a separator between H and Q in G.

3 Preliminary lemmas

Lemma 1. Let G = (V, E) be a prime co-chair-free graph. Then G is
(H1, H2, H3)-free. Further, if G is S1,2,2-free, then G is (H4, H5)-free, and
if G is S1,1,3-free, then G is (H4, H6, H7, H8)-free. See Figure 2 for the
graphs Hi, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 8}.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary that G contains an induced Hi, for some
i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 8} (as shown in Figure 2). Since G is prime, {a1, a2} is not
a module in G, so there exists a vertex x ∈ V \ V (Hi) such that (up to
symmetry) xa1 ∈ E and xa2 /∈ E(G). Then since {x, a1, b1, b2, a2} does not
induce a co-chair in G, x is adjacent to one of b1, b2.

Suppose that x is adjacent to both of b1, b2. Then since {x, b1, b2, a2, b3}
does not induce a co-chair in G, xb3 ∈ E, and since {x, b1, b2, a2, b4} does
not induce a co-chair in G, xb4 /∈ E. But, now {x, a1, b1, b3, b4} induces a
co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. Therefore, x is adjacent to exactly
one of b1, b2.

Suppose that i 6= 7, 8. We may assume (up to symmetry) that xb1 ∈ E
and xb2 /∈ E. Since {x, a1, b1, b2, b4} does not induce a co-chair in G, xb4 /∈

5

E, and then since {x, a1, b1, b3, b4} does not induce a co-chair in G, xb3 /∈ E.
Now, we prove a contradiction as follows:
i = 1: Since {x, a1, a2, b3, p} does not induce a co-chair in G, xp ∈ E. But,
now {x, a1, b3, b4, p} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. Thus,
G is H1-free.
i = 2: Since {x, a1, b1, p, b4} does not induce a co-chair in G, xp ∈ E. But,
now {x, b1, p, a2, b3} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. Thus,
G is H2-free.
i = 3: Since {x, a1, b1, b2, t} does not induce a co-chair in G, xt /∈ E, and
then since {x, a1, b1, p, t} does not induce a co-chair in G, xp ∈ E. Then
since {x, b1, p, a2, q} does not induce a co-chair in G, xq ∈ E. But, now
{b1, x, a1, q, b4} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. Thus, G
is H3-free.
i = 4: Since {x, a1, b1, b2, p} does not induce a co-chair in G, xp /∈ E. But,
now {x, a1, b3, b4, p, a2} induces an S1,2,2 in G or {x, a1, b3, b4, p, b2} induces
an S1,1,3 in G, a contradiction. Thus, G is H4-free.
i = 5: Since {x, b1, a2, b3, b4, p} does not induce an S1,2,2 in G, xp ∈ E. But,
now {x, p, a2, b3, b4, b2} induces an S1,2,2 in G, which is a contradiction.
Thus, G is H5-free.
i = 6: Since {x, a1, b1, b2, p} does not induce a co-chair in G, xp /∈ E. But,
now {x, b1, a2, b3, b4, p} induces an S1,1,3 in G, which is a contradiction.
Thus, G is H6-free.

Suppose that i = 7. Note that x is adjacent to exactly one of b1, b2. Then
as earlier xb3, xb4 /∈ E (otherwise, G induces a co-chair). Now, if xb1 ∈ E
and xb2 /∈ E, then since {x, b1, a2, b3, b4, p} does not induce an S1,1,3 in
G, xp ∈ E. But, now {p, x, b1, a1, b3} induces a co-chair in G, which is a
contradiction. Next, if xb2 ∈ E and xb1 /∈ E, then since {x, a1, b2, b1, p} does
not induce a co-chair in G, xp ∈ E. But, now {b4, b3, a1, x, p, a2} induces an
S1,1,3 in G, which is a contradiction. Thus, G is H7-free.

Suppose that i = 8. Again as earlier xb3, xb4 /∈ E (otherwise, G induces a
co-chair). Now, if xb1 ∈ E and xb2 /∈ E, then since {x, a1, b1, b2, p} does not
induce a co-chair in G, xp ∈ E. Also, since {x, a1, b1, b2, t} does not induce
a co-chair in G, xt /∈ E, and then since {x, a1, b1, q, t} does not induce a co-
chair in G, xq ∈ E. But, now {a2, b1, q, x, p} induces a co-chair in G, which is
a contradiction. Next, if xb2 ∈ E and xb1 /∈ E, then since {x, b2, p, b3, b4, b1}
does not induce an S1,1,3 in G, xp ∈ E. Also, since {x, a1, b1, b2, t} does
not induce a co-chair in G, xt /∈ E, and then since {x, a1, b2, q, t} does not
induce a co-chair in G, xq ∈ E. But, now {p, x, b2, q, t} induces a co-chair
in G, which is a contradiction. Thus, G is H8-free.

This completes the proof of Lemma 1.

Proof. Suppose to the contrary that G contains an induced twin-C5, say H

as shown in Figure 3. Since G is prime, {v2, v′

there exists a vertex x in V \ V (H) such that (up to symmetry) xv′
2, v1, v3, v4, v5, x} does not induce a 5-apple in G,
xv2 /∈ E. Then since {v′
xvi ∈ E, for some i ∈ {1, 3, 4, 5}. If xv1 ∈ E, then since G is diamond-free,
xv3, xv5 /∈ E. Then since {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, x} does not induce a 5-apple in
G, xv4 ∈ E, but then {v1, v′
5 in G, which is a
contradiction. A similar contradiction arises if we assume xv3 ∈ E. So,
we may assume that xv1, xv3 /∈ E. Then since G is 5-apple-free, xv4 ∈ E
and xv5 ∈ E. Now, {v1, v′
5 in G, which is a
contradiction. So, G is twin-C5-free.

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graphs

In this section, we show that the MWIS problem can be eﬃciently solved
in the class of (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graphs by analyzing the atomic
structure of the subclasses of this class of graphs.

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple, C ∗

Theorem 3. Let G = (V, E) be a prime (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple,
If G contains an odd hole C2k+1 with k ≥ 2, then G is
C ∗
claw-free.

5 )-free graph.

7

Proof. Since G is prime, it is connected, and by Lemma 2, G is twin-C5-free.
Let C denotes a shortest odd hole C2k+1 in G with vertices v1, v2, . . . , v2k+1
and edges vivi+1, v2k+1v1 ∈ E, where i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2k} with k ≥ 2. Then it
is veriﬁed that the following claim holds.

Claim 3.1. If x ∈ V (G) \ V (C) has a neighbor on C, then there exists an
i such that N (x) ∩ V (C) = {vi, vi+1}.

Proof of Claim 3.1: If k = 2, since G is (5-apple, C ∗
5 , twin-C5, diamond)-
free, the claim holds. So, suppose that k ≥ 3. To prove the claim, we prove
the following:
(1) There exists an i such that xvi, xvi+1 ∈ E and xvi−1, xvi+2 /∈ E.
(2) Either |N (x) ∩ V (C)| = 2 or |N (x) ∩ V (C)| = 4. Moreover, there
exists an i such that N (x) ∩ V (C) = {vi, vi+1} (if |N (x) ∩ V (C)| = 2), and
N (x) ∩ V (C) = {vi, vi+1, vj, vj+1}, for some j ∈ {i + 3, i + 4, . . . , i + 2k − 2}
(if |N (x) ∩ V (C)| = 4).

Since x has a neighbor on C, we may assume that x is adjacent to vi on C.

If (1) does not hold, then xvi+1, xvi−1 /∈ E. Then since {vi−2, vi−1, vi, vi+1, vi+2, x}
does not induce an S1,2,2 in G, we have either xvi−2 ∈ E or xvi+2 ∈ E. We
may assume, up to symmetry, that xvi−2 ∈ E. Then since {vi+3, vi+2, vi+1, vi, vi−1, x}
does not induce a C5 or an S1,1,3 in G, we have xvi+2 ∈ E. Then since
{vi+1, vi+2, x, vi−2, vi−1, vi−3} does not induce an S1,1,3 in G, xvi−3 ∈ E.
Then since G is diamond-free, {vi+3, vi−3, x, vi, vi+1, vi−1} induces an S1,1,3
in G (if k = 3) or {vi−4, vi−3, x, vi, vi+1, vi−1} induces an S1,1,3 in G (if
k ≥ 4), a contradiction. So (1) holds.

By (1), we have {vi, vi+1} ⊆ N (x)∩V (C), and xvi−1, xvi+2 /∈ E. Further,
if there exists an index j ∈ {i + 3, i + 4, . . . , i + 2k − 1} such that xvj ∈ E
and xvj−1 /∈ E, then xvj+1 ∈ E (for, otherwise, {vi−1, vi, vi+1, vi+2, x} ∪
{vj−1, vj, vj+1} induces an S1,1,3 in G). Now, if x is adjacent to a vertex
vt on C, where t /∈ {i − 1, i, i + 1, i + 2, j − 1, j, j + 1, j + 2}, then either a
diamond or an S1,2,2 is an induced subgraph of G, which is a contradiction.
Hence N (x) ∩ V (C) = {vi, vi+1} or N (x) ∩ V (C) = {vi, vi+1, vj, vj+1}, for
some j ∈ {i + 3, i + 4, . . . , i + 2k − 2}. So (2) holds.

Further, if |N (x) ∩ V (C)| = 4, then G contains an odd hole C ′ shorter

than C, which is a contradiction to the choice of C. ♦

To prove the theorem, we suppose for contradiction that G contains an
induced claw, say K with vertex-set {a, b, c, d} and edge-set {ab, ac, ad}. By
Claim 3.1, K cannot have more than two vertices on C. Also, at most one
vertex in {b, c, d} belongs to C. Now we have following cases (the other cases
are symmetric):

8

(1) V (K) ∩ V (C) = {a, d}: Let y be the other neighbor of a on C. Then
by Claim 3.1, by, cy ∈ E. But, now {a, b, c, y} induces a diamond in
G, which is a contradiction.

(2) V (K) ∩ V (C) = {a}: We may assume (wlog.) that a = v1. Then by
Claim 3.1, at least two vertices in {b, c, d} are adjacent either to v2 or
to v2k+1, say b and c are adjacent to v2. Then {a, v2, b, c} induces a
diamond in G, which is a contradiction.

(3) V (K) ∩ V (C) = {d}: We may assume (wlog.) that d = v1. Then by
Claim 3.1, up to symmetry, we may assume av2 ∈ E. Suppose that k =
2. Then since G is (S1,1,3, 5-apple, diamond)-free, both b and c have
neighbors in C. To avoid a diamond in G and by Claim 3.1, we assume
(wlog.) that bv3, bv4, cv4, cv5 ∈ E. But, now {d = v1, a, b, v4, v5, c}
5 in G, which is a contradiction. So, suppose that k ≥ 3.
induces a C ∗
Then since G is diamond-free, bv2, cv2 /∈ E. We claim that either
bv3 ∈ E or cv3 ∈ E. Otherwise, since {v4, v3, v2, a, b, c} does not induce
an S1,1,3 in G, either bv4 ∈ E or cv4 ∈ E. But, now {v4, v3, v2, a, b, c}
induces a C5 in G, which is a contradiction to the fact that k ≥ 3
and the choice of C. Thus, we may assume that bv3 ∈ E. Then by
Claim 3.1, bv4 ∈ E. Then cv3 /∈ E (for, otherwise, by Claim 3.1,
cv4 ∈ E, but then {v3, v4, b, c} induces a diamond in G), and hence
cv4 /∈ E (for, otherwise, {a, c, v4, v3, v2} induces a C5 in G). Now,
{v5, v4, b, a, c} induces a C5 in G (if cv5 ∈ E) or {v5, v4, b, a, d(= v1), c}
induces an S1,1,3 in G (if cv5 /∈ E), a contradiction.

(4) V (K) ∩ V (C) = ∅ and a vertex of K has a neighbor on C: Assume
a has neighbors on C, say v1 and v2. Then to avoid an induced claw
intersecting C, both v1 and v2 have exactly two neighbors among b, c, d.
We may assume (wlog.)
that v1 is adjacent to b and c. But, now
{v1, a, b, c} induces a diamond in G, which is a contradiction. So,
assume that a has no neighbor on C. Assume (wlog.) that b has a
neighbor on C. By Claim 3.1, we may assume that N (b) ∩ V (C) =
{v1, v2}. Then since G is S1,1,3-free, both c and d have neighbors on C.
Now, v2 is adjacent to either c or d (for, otherwise, {v3, v2, b, a, c, d}
will induce an S1,1,3 or a C5 in G). Assume that cv2 ∈ E. Since G is
diamond-free, cv1 /∈ E and by Claim 1, cv3 ∈ E. Thus, N (c) ∩ V (C) =
{v2, v3}. By similar arguments, we see that N (d)∩V (C) = {v1, v2k+1}.
Now, {v4, v3, c, a, b, d} induces an S1,1,3 in G, which is a contradiction.

(5) V (K) ∩ V (C) = ∅ and no vertex of K has a neighbor on C: Since G

9

is connected, there exists an i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 2k + 1} and a path vi =
u1 − u2 − · · · − ut − a, say P connecting vi and a in G (where t ≥ 2)
and with u2 has a neighbor on C. By the choice of P , no vertex of this
path has a neighbor on C except u2. By Claim 3.1, either u2vi+1 /∈ E
or u2vi−1 /∈ E. Assume that u2vi+1 /∈ E. Now, ut 6= b, c, d (for,
otherwise (wlog.) if ut = b, then {vi+1, vi = u1, u2, . . . , ut = b, a, c, d}
induces an S1,1,3 in G). Then since G is diamond-free, at least two
vertices in {b, c, d} are not adjacent to ut, say b and c. Then {vi+1, vi =
u1, u2, . . . , ut, a, b, c} induces an S1,1,3 in G, which is a contradiction.

Hence G is claw-free, and this completes the proof of the theorem.

Theorem 4. The MWIS problem can be solved in polynomial time for
(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple, C ∗

5 )-free graphs.

Proof. Let G be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple, C ∗
5 )-free graph. If G
is odd-hole-free, then G is (odd-hole, diamond)-free. Since MWIS in (odd-
hole, diamond)-free graphs can be solved in polynomial time [8], MWIS can
be solved in polynomial time for G. Suppose that G is prime and contains
an odd-hole. Then by Theorem 3, G is claw-free. Since MWIS in claw-
free graphs can be solved in polynomial time [28], MWIS can be solved in
polynomial time for G. Then the time complexity is the same when G is
not prime, by Theorem 1.

4.2

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple)-free graphs

Theorem 5. Let G = (V, E) be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple)-free
graph. Then G is nearly C ∗

5 -free.

Proof. Let us assume on the contrary that there is a vertex v ∈ V (G) such
that G \ N [v] contains an induced C ∗
5 , say H, with vertices named as in
Figure 3. Let C denotes the 5-cycle induced by the vertices {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5}
in H. For i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 6}, we deﬁne sets Ai, A+
i , A+, and Q as in the last
paragraph of Section 2. To prove the theorem, it is enough to show that
A+ = ∅. Assume to the contrary that A+ 6= ∅, and let x ∈ A+. Then
there exists a vertex z ∈ Q such that xz ∈ E. Then since G is (5-apple,
diamond)-free, |NH (x) ∩ V (C)| ∈ {0, 2, 3}. Now:

(i) If |NH(x) ∩ V (C)| = 0, then since x ∈ N (H), xv6 ∈ E. But then

{z, x, v6, v1, v2, v5} induces an S1,1,3 in G, which is a contradiction.

10

(ii) If |NH(x) ∩ V (C)| = 2, and if NH(x) ∩ V (C) = {vi, vi+2}, for some
i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, i mod 5, then {z, x, vi+2, vi+3, vi+4, vi} induces a 5-
apple in G, which is a contradiction.

(iii) If |NH(x) ∩ V (C)| = 2, and if NH(x) ∩ V (C) = {vi, vi+1}, for some
i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, i mod 5, then since {z, x} ∪ V (H) does not induce a
diamond or an S1,1,3 in G, we have i 6= 3. Again, since G is diamond-
free, xv6 /∈ E. But, then {z, x} ∪ V (H) induces either an S1,1,3 or an
S1,2,2 in G, which is a contradiction.

(iv) If |NH(x) ∩ V (C)| = 3, then since G is diamond-free, NH (x) ∩ V (C) =
{vi, vi+1, vi+3}, for some i ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, i mod 5. Then since G is
diamond-free, i 6= 3 and xv6 /∈ E. But, then {z, x} ∪ V (H) induces
either an S1,1,3 or an S1,2,2 in G, which is a contradiction.

These contradictions show that A+ = ∅, and hence G is nearly C ∗

5 -free.

Theorem 6. The MWIS problem can be solved in polynomial time for
(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple)-free graphs.

Proof. Let G be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple)-free graph. Then by
Theorem 5, G is nearly C ∗
5 -free. Since MWIS in (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond,
5-apple, C ∗
5 )-free graphs can be solved in polynomial time (by Theorem 4),
by the consequence given below equation (1) in Section 2, MWIS in (S1,2,2,
S1,1,3, diamond, 5-apple)-free graphs can be solved in polynomial time.

4.3

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graphs

Theorem 7. Let G = (V, E) be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graph.
Then every atom of G is nearly 5-apple-free.

Proof. Let G′ be an atom of G. We want to show that G′ is nearly 5-apple-
free, so let us assume on the contrary that there is a vertex v ∈ V (G′)
such that G′ \ N [v] contains an induced 5-apple H. Let H have vertex
set {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6} and edge set {v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, v4v5, v5v1, v1v6}. Let
C denotes the 5-cycle induced by the vertices {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} in H. For
i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 6}, we deﬁne sets Ai, A+
i , A+, and Q, with respect to G, v
and H, as in the last paragraph of Section 2. Then, we immediately have
the following:

Claim 7.1. If x ∈ N (H), then |NH(x)∩V (C)| ≤ 3. In particular, if x ∈ A+,
then |NH(x) ∩ V (C)| = 3, and hence there exists an index j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 5},
j mod 5, such that NH(x) ∩ V (C) = {vj, vj+1, vj+3}. ♦

11

So, we have:
Claim 7.2. A+
1 = A+
Claim 7.3. If x ∈ A+

5 = A+

2 = A+
3 , then NH(x) is equal to {v1, v3, v4}.

6 = ∅.

Proof of Claim 7.3. Suppose not. Then by Claim 7.1, there exists an index
j ∈ {1, 2, 4, 5}, j mod 5, such that NH (x) = {vj, vj+1, vj+3}. Since x ∈ A+
3 ,
xv6 /∈ E, and there exists a vertex z in Q such that xz ∈ E. Now, if
NH (x) = {v1, v2, v4}, then {v6, v1, x, v4, v3, z} induces an S1,2,2 in G, and
if NH(x) = {v2, v3, v5}, then {v6, v1, v5, x, v3, z} induces an S1,1,3 in G, a
contradiction. Since the other cases are symmetric, the claim follows. ♦
Claim 7.4. |A+
Proof of Claim 7.4. Suppose not. Let x, y ∈ A+
3 . By Claim 7.3, NH(x) =
NH (y) = {v1, v3, v4}. Now, if xy ∈ E, then {v4, x, y, v1} induces a dia-
mond in G, and if xy /∈ E, then {v4, x, y, v3} induces a diamond in G, a
contradiction. ♦
Claim 7.5. If x ∈ A+

4 , then NH(x) is equal to {v1, v3, v4, v6}.

3 | = 1.

4 | = 1.

Proof of Claim 7.5. Suppose not. Then by Claim 7.1, there exists an index
j ∈ {1, 2, 4, 5}, j mod 5, such that NH (x) ∩ V (C) = {vj, vj+1, vj+3}. Since
x ∈ A+
4 , xv6 ∈ E and there exists a vertex z in Q such that xz ∈ E. Now,
if NH (x) ∩ V (C) = {v1, v2, v4}, then {v6, v1, v2, x} induces a diamond in
G, and if NH (x) ∩ V (C) = {v2, v3, v5}, then {v1, v6, x, v3, v4, z} induces an
S1,2,2 in G, a contradiction. Since the other cases are symmetric, the claim
follows. ♦
Claim 7.6. |A+
Proof of Claim 7.6. Suppose not. Let x, y ∈ A+
4 . By Claim 7.5, NH(x) =
NH (y) = {v1, v3, v4, v6}. Now, if xy ∈ E, then {v4, x, y, v3} induces a di-
amond in G, a contradiction and if xy /∈ E, then {v3, v4, x, y} induces a
diamond in G, a contradiction. ♦
Claim 7.7. At most one of A+
Proof of Claim 7.7. Suppose not. Let x ∈ A+
4 . By Claim 7.3,
NH (x) = {v1, v3, v4}, and by Claim 7.5, NH (y) = {v1, v3, v4, v6}. Now, if
xy ∈ E, then {v3, x, y, v1} induces a diamond in G, a contradiction, and if
xy /∈ E, then {v3, v4, x, y} induces a diamond in G, a contradiction. ♦

3 and y ∈ A+

4 is non-empty.

3 or A+

Now, by Claim 7.2, A+ = A+

4 , and by Claims 7.4, 7.6 and 7.7, A+
is a clique. Since A+ is a separator between H and Q in G, we obtain that

3 ∪ A+

12

V (G′) ∩ A+ is a clique separator in G′ between H and V (G′) ∩ Q (which
contains v). This is a contradiction to the fact that G′ is an atom.

Theorem 8. The MWIS problem can be solved in polynomial time for
(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graphs.

Proof. Let G be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graph. Then by Theorem 7,
every atom of G is nearly 5-apple-free. Since MWIS in (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, dia-
mond, 5-apple)-free graphs can be solved in polynomial time (by Theorem 6),
MWIS in (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graphs can be solved in polynomial
time, by Theorem 2.

5

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair)-free graphs

In this section, we show that the MWIS problem can be eﬃciently solved
in the class of (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair)-free graphs by analyzing the atomic
structure of the subclasses of this class of graphs.

5.1

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, gem)-free graphs

Theorem 9. The MWIS problem can be solved in polynomial time for
(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, gem)-free graphs.

Proof. Let G be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, gem)-free graph. First suppose
that G is prime. Then by Lemma 3, G is diamond-free. Since the MWIS
problem in (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, diamond)-free graphs can be solved in polynomial
time (by Theorem 8), MWIS can be solved in polynomial time for G, by
Theorem 1. Then the time complexity is the same when G is not prime, by
Theorem 1.

5.2

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, H ∗)-free graphs

Theorem 10. Let G = (V, E) be a prime (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, H ∗)-free
graph. Then every atom of G is nearly gem-free (see Figure 3 for the graph
H ∗).

Proof. Let G′ be an atom of G. We want to show that G′ is nearly gem-
free, so let us assume on the contrary that there is a vertex v ∈ V (G′) such
that the anti-neighborhood of v in G′ contains an induced gem H. Let H
have vertex set {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} and edge set {v1v2, v2v3, v3v4, v1v5, v2v5,
v3v5, v4v5}. For i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 5}, we deﬁne sets Ai, A+
i , and Q, with

i , A−

13

respect to G, v and H, as in the last paragraph of Section 2. Then we have
the following properties:

Claim 10.1. Every vertex x in N (H) satisﬁes either v5 ∈ N (x) or x has
at least one neighbor in {v2, v3}. In particular, (i) if x ∈ A1, then NH(x) =
{v5}, and (ii) if x ∈ A2, then NA(x) ∈ {{v2, v3}, {v2, v5}, {v3, v5}, {v1, v3},
{v2, v4}}.

Proof of Claim 10.1. Suppose to the contrary that xv5 /∈ E and x has
no neighbor in {v2, v3}. Then, up to symmetry, we have xv1 ∈ E, and so
{x, v1, v2, v3, v5} induces a co-chair in G, a contradiction. ♦

Let B ∗ denote the set {x ∈ A2 : NA(x) = {v1, v3}} ∪ {x ∈ A2 : NA(x) =

{v2, v4}}.
Claim 10.2. A+

2 = A+

3 = A+

4 = ∅.

Proof of Claim 10.2.

2 ∪ A+

3 ∪ A+

Assume the contrary and let x ∈ A+

4 . There is a vertex z
in Q such that xz ∈ E. First suppose that xv5 /∈ E. Then by Claim 10.1,
x has at least one neighbor in {v2, v3}. Now, if {v2, v3} ⊆ NH(x), then
{v5, v2, v3, x, z} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. So, we
may assume that x has exactly one neighbor in {v2, v3}, say xv2 ∈ E and
xv3 /∈ E. Since x ∈ A+
(i ≥ 2), either xv1 ∈ E or xv4 ∈ E. But, then
i
either {v5, v1, v2, x, z} induces a co-chair in G, or {v5, v2, v3, v4, x, z} induces
a H ∗ in G, respectively, a contradiction. So, suppose that xv5 ∈ E. Then
it follows that there is a clique {p, q, r} ⊂ V (H) such that xp, xq ∈ E and
xr /∈ E. Then {z, x, p, q, r} induces a co-chair in G, a contradiction. ♦
Claim 10.3. For each i ∈ {2, . . . , 5}, A+
Proof of Claim 10.3. Assume the contrary. Let x ∈ A+
i be
such that xy /∈ E. Since x ∈ A+
5 , there exists z ∈ Q such that xz ∈ E.
Now, if y ∈ (S5
i ) \ B ∗, then there exist vertices p, q ∈ V (H) such
that pq ∈ E and yp, yq ∈ E. Then {z, x, p, q, y} induces a co-chair in G, a
contradiction. So, y ∈ B ∗. But, now, {x, v4, v5, v1, y} induces a co-chair in
G, a contradiction. ♦
Claim 10.4. A+
Proof of Claim 10.4: Suppose the contrary. Then G[A+
5 ] has a co-connected
component X of size at least 2. Since G is prime, X is not a module in G in
G, so there is a vertex z in V (G) \ X that distinguishes two vertices x and
y of X, and since X is co-connected we can choose x and y non-adjacent.
Clearly z /∈ H and z /∈ A+
5 . So either (i) z has no neighbor in H, or (ii)

5 is complete to A−
i .

5 and y ∈ A−

i=2 A−

5 is a clique.

14

z ∈ A− and so, by Claim 10.3 (since {z} is not complete to A+
5 ), z ∈ A−
1 ,
or (iii) z ∈ A+ and so, by Claim 10.2, z ∈ A+
In either of these three
1 .
cases, by Claim 10.1, we see that {z, x, y, v1, v2} induces a co-chair in G, a
contradiction. ♦

Let B = A−

2 ∪ A−

3 ∪ A−

4 ∪ A−
5 .

Claim 10.5. If A+

1 6= ∅, then {v5} is complete to B.

1 6= ∅, there is a vertex a ∈ A+

Proof of Claim 10.5: Assume on the contrary that there is a vertex x ∈ B
such that xv5 /∈ E(G). Since A+
1 and a vertex
z ∈ Q such that az ∈ E(G). Recall that NH(a) = {v5}, by Claim 10.1. Now,
if there exists vertices p, q ∈ {v1, v2, v3, v4} such that pq ∈ E and xp, xq ∈ E,
then since {x, p, q, v5, a} does not induce a co-chair in G, xa ∈ E. But, then
{z, a, x, v5, p, q} induces a H ∗ in G, a contradiction. So, we may assume
that NH(x) ∩ {v1, v2, v3, v4} is an independent set. Hence by Claim 10.1,
NH (x) is either {v1, v3} or {v2, v4}. We may assume, up to symmetry,
that NH(x) = {v1, v3}. Then since {z, a, v5, v1, x, v4} does not induce an
S1,2,2 in G, xa ∈ E. But, then {z, a, x, v3, v2, v4} induces an S1,1,3 in G, a
contradiction. ♦
Claim 10.6. There is no edge between A+
Proof of Claim 10.6: Assume the contrary, and let a ∈ A+
1 and b ∈ B be
such that ab ∈ E. Since a ∈ A+
1 , there exists y ∈ Q such that ay ∈ E.
Since b ∈ B, by Claim 10.5 there exists an index j (j ∈ {1, . . . , 4}) such
that bv5, bvj ∈ E. Then {y, a, b, v5, vj} induces a co-chair in G, which is a
contradiction. ♦
Claim 10.7. If a ∈ A+
a path in G.
Proof of Claim 10.7: Assume the contrary. Since a ∈ A+
1 , there exists a
vertex z ∈ Q such that az ∈ E. By Claim 10.6, ab /∈ E. Thus, by the
assumption, ax ∈ E and xb ∈ E. Also, by Claims 10.1 and 10.5, we have
av5, xv5 ∈ E and bv5 ∈ E. But, now {z, a, x, b, v5} induces a co-chair in G,
which is a contradiction. ♦

1 , then {a, b, x} does not induce

1 , b ∈ B, and x ∈ A−

1 and B.

Suppose that A+

1 = ∅. Then A+ = A+

5 , which is a clique by Claim 10.4.
Since A+ is a separator in G between H and Q, it follows that V (G′) ∩ A+ is
a clique separator in G′ between H and V (G′) ∩ Q (which contains v); this
is a contradiction to the fact that G′ is an atom. Therefore A+
1 6= ∅. Now,
Claims 10.1 and 10.2 imply that N (v4) ⊆ {v3, v5}∪B ∪A+
5 , and Claims 10.4,
10.6, and 10.7 imply that A+
5 ∪ {v2, v3, v5} is a clique separator between {v4}

15

and Q in G. Hence V (G′) ∩ (A+
5 ∪ {v2, v3, v5}) is a clique separator between
{v4} and V (G′) ∩ Q in G′, again a contradiction to the fact that G′ is an
atom.

Theorem 11. The MWIS problem can be solved in polynomial time for
(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, H ∗)-free graphs.

Proof. Let G be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, H ∗)-free graph. First suppose
that G is prime. By Theorem 10, every atom of G is nearly gem-free.
Since the MWIS in (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, gem)-free graphs can be solved
in polynomial time (by Theorem 9), MWIS in (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair, H ∗)-
free graphs can be solved in polynomial time, by Theorem 2. Then the time
complexity is the same when G is not prime, by Theorem 1.

5.3

(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair)-free graphs

Theorem 12. Let G = (V, E) be a prime (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair)-free graph.
Then every atom of G is nearly H ∗-free.

Proof. Let G′ be an atom of G. We want to show that G′ is nearly H ∗-
free, so let us assume on the contrary that there is a vertex v ∈ V (G′) such
that the anti-neighborhood of v in G′ contains an induced H ∗ as shown in
Figure 3. For i = 1, . . . , 6 we deﬁne sets Ai, A+
i , and Q, with respect
to G, v and H, as in the last paragraph of Section 2. Then we have the
following properties:

i , A−

Claim 12.1. A1 = ∅.

Proof of Claim 12.1. Suppose to the contrary that A1 6= ∅, and let x ∈ A1.
Then: (i) If NH ∗ (x) is either {v1} or {v3}, then {x} ∪ V (H ∗) induces a
graph which is isomorphic to H7 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. (ii) If
NH ∗ (x) is either {v2} or {v4}, then {x, v1, v2, v3, v4} induces a co-chair in G,
which is a contradiction. (iii) If NH ∗(x) = {v5}, then {x} ∪ V (H ∗) induces
a graph which is isomorphic to H6 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. (iv)
If NH ∗(x) = {v6}, then {x} ∪ V (H ∗) induces a graph which is isomorphic
to H4 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. So, the claim holds. ♦

Claim 12.2. If x ∈ A2, then NH ∗ (x) ∈ {{v1, v2}, {v1, v4}, {v1, v5}, {v1, v6},
{v2, v3}, {v3, v4}, {v3, v5}, {v3, v6}, {v5, v6}}.

Proof of Claim 12.2. For, otherwise if NH ∗(x) ∈ {{v1, v3}, {v2, v5}, {v2, v6},
{v4, v5}, {v4, v6}}, then {x, v1, v2, v3, v4} induces a co-chair in G, which is a

16

contradiction, and if NH ∗(x) is {v2, v4}, then {x} ∪ V (H ∗) induces a graph
which is isomorphic to H5 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. So, the claim
holds. ♦

2 = ∅.

Claim 12.3. A+
2 6= ∅, and let x ∈ A+
Proof of Claim 12.3. Suppose to the contrary that A+
2 .
Then there is a vertex z in Q such that xz ∈ E. We use Claim 12.2 to
derive a contradiction to our assumption as follows: Now, if NH ∗(x) ∈
{{v1, v2}, {v1, v4}, {v2, v3}, {v3, v4}}, then it follows that there is a clique
{p, q, r} ⊂ V (H ∗) such that xp, xq ∈ E and xr /∈ E. But, then {z, x, p, q, r}
if NH ∗(x) ∈
induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. Next,
{{v1, v5}, {v1, v6}, {v3, v5}, {v3, v6}}, then {z, x, v1, v3, v5, v6} induces an S1,2,2
in G, which is a contradiction. Finally, if NH ∗(x) is {v5, v6}, then {v1, v2, v3,
v4, v5, x, z} induces a graph which is isomorphic to H4 in G, a contradiction
to Lemma 1. So, A+

2 = ∅, and the claim holds. ♦

Claim 12.4. If x ∈ A3, then NH ∗(x) ∈ {{v1, v2, v4}, {v1, v3, v5}, {v1, v5, v6},
{v2, v3, v4}, {v2, v4, v6}, {v3, v5, v6}}.

Proof of Claim 12.4. Suppose the contrary. Now, if v6 ∈ NH ∗(x), then since
x ∈ A3, |NH ∗(x) ∩ {v1, v2, v3, v4}| ∈ {1, 2}. If |NH ∗(x) ∩ {v1, v2, v3, v4}| = 2,
then it follows that there is a clique {p, q, r} ⊂ {v1, v2, v3, v4} such that
xp, xq ∈ E and xr /∈ E. But, then {v6, x, p, q, r} induces a co-chair in
G, which is a contradiction. So, |NH ∗(x) ∩ {v1, v2, v3, v4}| = 1, and hence
v5 ∈ NH ∗(x). Since x ∈ A3 and by our contrary assumption, either v2 ∈
NH ∗ (x) or v4 ∈ NH ∗(x). But, then {v1, v2, v3, v4, x} induces a co-chair in G,
which is a contradiction. So, we may assume that v6 /∈ NH ∗ (x). Now, (i)
if NH ∗(x) is {v1, v2, v3}, then {x, v1, v3, v4, v5} induces a co-chair in G, (ii)
if NH ∗(x) is {v2, v3, v5}, then {x, v2, v3, v5, v6} induces a co-chair in G, and
(iii) if NH ∗ (x) is {v1, v2, v5}, then {x, v1, v2, v5, v6} induces a co-chair in G,
which are contradictions. Finally, if NH ∗(x) is {v2, v4, v5}, then {x}∪V (H ∗)
induces a graph which is isomorphic to H1 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1.
Hence the claim is proved. ♦

Claim 12.5. If x ∈ A+

3 , then NH ∗ (x) is either {v1, v5, v6} or {v3, v5, v6}.

Proof of Claim 12.5. For, otherwise, by Claim 12.4, NH ∗ (x) ∈ {{v1, v2, v4},
{v1, v3, v5}, {v2, v3, v4}, {v2, v4, v6}}. Since x ∈ A+
3 , there is a vertex z in Q
such that xz ∈ E. Now, if NH ∗(x) ∈ {{v1, v2, v4}, {v1, v3, v5}, {v2, v3, v4}},
then it follows that there is a clique {p, q, r} ⊂ V (H ∗) such that xp, xq ∈ E
and xr /∈ E. But, then {z, x, p, q, r} induces a co-chair in G, which is

17

a contradiction. Next, if NH ∗(x) is {v2, v4, v6}, then {v1, v2, v3, v4, v6, x, z}
induces a graph which is isomorphic to H6 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1.
So the claim is proved. ♦

Let B ′

3 denotes the set {x ∈ A+

3 | NH ∗(x) = {v1, v5, v6}} and let B ′′
3

denotes the set {x ∈ A+

3 | NH ∗(x) = {v3, v5, v6}}.

Claim 12.6. B ′

3 and B ′′

3 are cliques in G.

3 such that xy /∈ E. Since x ∈ A+

Proof of Claim 12.6. Suppose to the contrary that there exists vertices
x, y ∈ B ′
3 , there exists a vertex z in Q such
that xz ∈ E. Now, if yz ∈ E, then {z, x, y, v5, v6, v1, v3} induces a graph
which is isomorphic to H5 in G, which contradicts Lemma 1, and if yz /∈ E,
then {v5, v6, x, y, z} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. Hence,
B ′

3 is a clique in G. Similarly, B ′′

3 is also a clique in G. ♦

Claim 12.7. At most one of B ′

3 or B ′′

3 is non-empty.

Proof of Claim 12.7. Suppose the contrary, and let x ∈ B ′
3 and y ∈ B ′′
3 .
Then since {x, y, v1, v5, v6} does not induce a co-chair in G, xy ∈ E. Since
x ∈ A+
3 , there exists a vertex z in Q such that xz ∈ E. Now, if yz ∈ E, then
{v2, v5, x, y, z} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction, and if yz /∈
E, then {z, x, y, v3, v2, v4} induces an S1,1,3 in G, which is a contradiction.
Hence the claim. ♦

4 = ∅.

Claim 12.8. A+
Proof of Claim 12.8. Suppose to the contrary that A+
4 6= ∅ and let x ∈ A+
4 .
There is a vertex z in Q such that xz ∈ E. Now, if x is adjacent to all the
vertices in {v1, v2, v3, v4}, then {z, x, v1, v2, v4, v4, v6} induces a graph which
is isomorphic to H7 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. So, we may assume
that x is non-adjacent to at least one vertex in {v1, v2, v3, v4}. Also, since
x ∈ A+
4 , x is adjacent to at least two vertices in {v1, v2, v3, v4}. Now, if
NH ∗ (x) is {v2, v4, v5, v6}, then {x, v1, v2, v5, v6} induces a co-chair in G, a
contradiction, and in all the other cases, there is a clique {p, q, r} ⊂ V (H ∗)
such that xp, xq ∈ E and xr /∈ E. But, then {z, x, p, q, r} induces a co-chair
in G, which is a contradiction. ♦

5 = ∅.

Claim 12.9. A+
5 6= ∅ and let x ∈ A+
Proof of Claim 12.9. Suppose to the contrary that A+
5 .
Then there is a vertex z in Q such that xz ∈ E. Suppose x is adjacent
to all the vertices in {v1, v2, v3, v4}. Further, if x is adjacent to v5, then

18

{x, v2, v3, v5, v6} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction, and if x
is adjacent to v6, then {x} ∪ V (H ∗) induces a graph which is isomorphic
to H2 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. So, we may assume that x is
non-adjacent to exactly one vertex in {v1, v2, v3, v4}. Then, there is a clique
{p, q, r} ⊂ V (H ∗) such that xp, xq ∈ E and xr /∈ E. But, then {z, x, p, q, r}
induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. ♦

Claim 12.10. A+

3 is complete to A+
6 .

3 and y ∈ A+

Proof of Claim 12.10. Suppose to the contrary that there exist vertices
x ∈ A+
6 such that xy /∈ E. Then by Claim 12.5, NH ∗(x) is either
{v1, v5, v6} or {v3, v5, v6}. Then either {v3, y, v5, v6, x} or {v1, y, v5, v6, x}
induces a co-chair in G, a contradiction. ♦

6 and y ∈ A−

6 is complete to A−
i .

Claim 12.11. For each i ∈ {2, . . . , 6}, A+
Proof of Claim 12.11. Assume the contrary. Let x ∈ A+
i be
such that xy /∈ E. Since x ∈ A+
6 , there exists z ∈ Q such that xz ∈ E. Now,
if there exists vertices p, q ∈ V (H ∗) such that pq ∈ E and py, qy ∈ E, then
{z, x, p, q, y} induces a co-chair in G, which is a contradiction. So, we as-
sume that NH ∗ (y) is an independent set. Then by the above claims on A+
i ,
i ≥ 2, we have NH ∗(y) ∈ {{v1, v5}, {v1, v6}, {v3, v5}, {v3, v6}, {v2, v4, v6}}.
if NH ∗(y) ∈ {{v1, v5}, {v3, v5}}, then {z, x, y} ∪ V (H ∗) induces a
Now,
graph which is isomorphic to H8 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. So,
NH ∗ (y) ∈ {{v1, v6}, {v3, v6}, {v2, v4, v6}}. But, then {v1, v4, v5, x, y} induces
a co-chair in G (if NH ∗(y) = {v1, v6}), and {v3, v4, v5, x, y} induces a co-
chair in G (if NH ∗(y) = {v3, v6}), which are contradictions. Finally, if
NH ∗ (y) = {v2, v4, v6}, then {z, x, y} ∪ V (H ∗) induces a graph which is iso-
morphic to H3 in G, a contradiction to Lemma 1. ♦

6 is a clique.

Claim 12.12. A+
Proof of Claim 12.12: Suppose the contrary. Then G[A+
6 ] has a co-connected
component X of size at least 2. Since G is prime, X is not a non-trivial
module in G, so there is a vertex z in V (G) \ X that distinguishes two
vertices x and y of X, and since X is co-connected we can choose x and y
non-adjacent. We may assume (wlog.) that xz ∈ E and yz /∈ E. Clearly
z /∈ V (H ∗) and z /∈ A+
6 . By Claims 12.1 and 12.11, z /∈ A−, and by
Claims 12.1, 12.3, 12.8, 12.9, and 12.10, we have z /∈ A+. Hence, z has no
neighbor in H ∗, and we see that {z, x, y, v1, v2} induces a co-chair in G, a
contradiction. ♦

19

By Claims 12.1, 12.3, 12.8, 12.9, we have A+ = A+

6 , which is a
clique by Claims 12.6, 12.7, 12.10, and 12.12. Since A+ is a separator in G
between H ∗ and Q, it follows that V (G′) ∩ A+ is a clique separator in G′
between H ∗ and V (G′) ∩ Q (which contains v); this is a contradiction to the
fact that G′ is an atom.

Theorem 13. The MWIS problem can be solved in polynomial time for
(S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair)-free graphs.

Proof. Let G be an (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, co-chair)-free graph. First suppose that
G is prime. By Theorem 12, every atom of G is nearly H ∗-free. Since the
MWIS problem in (S1,2,2, S1,1,3, H ∗, co-chair)-free graphs can be solved in
polynomial time (by Theorem 11), MWIS can be solved in polynomial time
for G, by Theorem 2. Then the time complexity is the same when G is not
prime, by Theorem 1.
