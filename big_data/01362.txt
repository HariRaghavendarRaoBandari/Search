Non-aligning self propelled particles with purely repulsive excluded volume interactions undergo
an athermal motility-induced phase separation into a dilute gas and a dense cluster phase. Here,
we use enhanced sampling computational methods and analytic theory to examine the kinetics of
formation of the dense phase. Despite the intrinsically nonequilibrium nature of the phase transition,
we show that the kinetics can be described using a framework analogous to equilibrium classical
nucleation theory, governed by an eﬀective free energy of cluster formation, with identiﬁable bulk
and surface terms. The theory captures the location of the binodal, nucleation rates as a function
of supersaturation, and the cluster size distributions below the binodal, while discrepancies in the
metastable region reveal additional physics about the early stages of active crystal formation. The
success of the theory shows that tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics can provide insights
into the kinetics of evolution toward nonequilibrium steady-states in active matter systems.

Active ﬂuids consisting of self-propelled units are
present in many biological systems,
including the cell
cytoplasm [1–3], bacterial suspensions [4–7], and ani-
mal ﬂocks [8–11]. Recently, researchers have also devel-
oped synthetic active ﬂuids, consisting of chemically [12–
17] or electrically [18] propelled colloids, or monolay-
ers of vibrated granular particles [19–22]. Being intrin-
sically nonequilibrium, active ﬂuids cannot be described
by equilibrium statistical mechanics [23, 24] and exhibit
behaviors not possible in equilibrium systems, such as
spontaneous ﬂow [25–38], anomalous density ﬂuctuations
[19, 39], and athermal phase separation [40–50]. Yet,
active systems frequently evolve to well-deﬁned time-
independent distributions, and in some cases are charac-
terized by equilibrium-like state variables such as temper-
ature or pressure [48, 51–57]. While signiﬁcant progress
has been made toward understanding these stationary
distributions, the kinetics of evolution toward steady-
state remain poorly understood.

As in equilibrium physics, progress in active matter of-
ten stems from simpliﬁed model systems. One such sys-
tem is composed of active Brownian particles (ABPs):
self-propelled particles which interact solely by short-
range isotropic repulsion. Despite lacking interparticle
attractions or alignment interactions, ABPs form macro-
scopic, crystalline clusters [40–45, 47, 58–60]. ABP phase
separation is strikingly reminiscent of equilibrium vapor-
liquid systems, with the densities of the coexisting phases
falling along a binodal, and critical-like behavior near its
apex. As a minimal model system possessing nontrivial
phase behavior, ABPs are ideal for studying evolution
toward steady-state in generic active systems. However,
while the coarsening of deeply quenched ABP clusters has
been studied numerically [41, 42, 45], there is no theory
for the complete kinetics of phase separation.

In this article, we describe ABP cluster formation dy-
namics and steady-state phase behavior with a theory

analogous to classical nucleation theory (CNT) for equi-
librium phase separation [61–63]. Beginning with the
geometry of self-propelled particle interactions, we con-
struct an eﬀective free energy of cluster formation which
resembles that of droplet nucleation in an equilibrium
liquid-vapor system, including a chemical potential and
surface tension. We then apply the framework of CNT
to calculate nucleation rates and critical nucleus sizes as
functions of particle density and propulsion velocity.

We test the theory against simulations of ABPs, em-
ploying enhanced sampling techniques to make system-
atic measurements of nucleation rates. Despite approxi-
mations in our microscopic model, the predicted phase
boundary matches simulation results almost quantita-
tively, with no ﬁtting parameters. Moreover, the pre-
dicted and measured cluster size distributions match well
below the binodal, though we discuss interesting diﬀer-
ences for small clusters that lead to power law scaling.
The theory qualitatively predicts the dependence of nu-
cleation rates on super-saturation, although signiﬁcant
quantitative diﬀerences are seen near the binodal.

While previous work has developed phenomenological
approaches such as Cahn-Hilliard and dynamic density
functional theories to describe active colloid athermal
phase separation [42, 64–66], here we show how such
frameworks directly emerge from the kinetics of the mi-
croscopic model. In the last century, CNT drove tremen-
dous advances in the ﬁelds of equilibrium crystallization
and self-assembly by relating relating particle-scale in-
teractions to their macroscale assembly dynamics. The
framework described here moves toward a similar capa-
bility in active materials, showing how the breaking of
time reversal symmetry at the level of individual parti-
cles controls emergent nonequilibrium assembly.

Here F represents the interparticle repulsion force, ξ is
the drag, vp is the magnitude of the self-propulsion ve-

locity, and ˆνi = (cos θi, sin θi). The η variables intro-
duce Gaussian noise, with (cid:104)ηi(t)(cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104)ηi(t)ηj(t(cid:48))(cid:105) =
δijδ(t−t(cid:48)). In principle the noise may be nonthermal, but
we choose thermal noise with the spatial and rotational
diﬀusion constants given by D = kBT /ξ and Dr = 3D
σ2 ,
with σ the particle diameter.

We now represent the instantaneous state of the system
by the number density ρn of clusters with n particles, and
write master equations for their time-evolution (following
the approach for equilibrium systems [67])

∂tρn = J(n − 1) − J(n)
J(n) = jin(n)S(n)ρn − jout(n+1)S(n+1)ρn+1,

(3)
(4)

where the ﬂuxes jin and jout represent the rates of
monomer gain and loss per unit of cluster surface and
S(n) is the surface area (perimeter) of a cluster of size
n. We have assumed that the system is well-mixed, and
that clusters evolve only by the gain and loss of individ-
ual monomers from their perimeters. Our results support
these assumptions, except for large clusters in systems
with high packing fractions.

We next consider a system at steady-state, so the ﬂuxes
J are zero, and solve Eq. 4 for the steady-state cluster
size distribution (CSD) P (n):

ρn = ρ1

jin(m)S(m)

≡ ρ1P (n),

(5)

jout(m + 1)S(m + 1)

m=1

This result is valid for metastable systems (in a quasi-
steady state), so long as the time to escape from the
metastable state is slow compared to the settling time of
the CSD. In this case, ρn must be explicitly set to zero
above some critical cluster size ncrit. While the existence
of such a steady-state is not guaranteed in a nonequilib-
rium system, they are consistently observed in our simu-
lations. Thus, while our microscopic equations of motion
violate microscopic reversibility, the system appears to
satisfy detailed balance at the level of the coarse vari-
ables {ρn}.

Next, we relax the steady-state assumption, but as-
sume that the cluster size distribution remains (quasi)
stationary, ∂tρn = 0, so the system satisﬁes balance
rather than the stronger condition of detailed balance.
All of the ﬂuxes J are then equal, and given by [68]

The mean nucleation time in a system with volume V is
then τnucl = (JV )−1 [61].

To continue the analogy with CNT, we deﬁne an ‘equi-
librium’ constant kc(n) = ρnv0
(ρgv0)n where v0 is the stan-
dard state volume and ρg measures the monomer density
in the “free volume” not occupied by clusters. We can
then write an eﬀective free energy change for the reaction
in which n monomers coalesce into an n-particle cluster:

G(n) = −kBTeﬀ ln kc(n) − nµ = −kBTeﬀ ln (v0ρn)

where µ is an eﬀective chemical potential (discussed be-
low), and kBTeﬀ gives dimensions of energy. The latter’s
value need not equal the physical temperature of Eqs. 1
and 2 and does not aﬀect any observables.

Kinetic Theory. Thus far, our formulation is ex-
act. To proceed further, we construct a minimal micro-
scopic model that enables estimating the adsorption and
evaporation ﬂuxes from clusters. We model each clus-
ter as circular, with volume V (n) = n/ρc and surface

area S(n) =(cid:112)4πn/ρc, comprised of nearly close-packed

spheres at number density ρc.

To estimate the arrival ﬂux jin, we assume the
monomer gas to be homogeneous, isotropic, and com-
posed of particles moving at a single constant speed vp.
We additionally assume vpσ/D (cid:29) 1 so we may ne-
glect the eﬀects of translational diﬀusion. The ﬂux of
monomers impinging on a cluster surface is then jin =
ρgvp
π , independent of cluster size.
For the departure ﬂux, we consider a stationary par-
ticle on a cluster surface, with its orientation evolving
diﬀusively. The particle remains on the surface only so
long as its propulsion is oriented inwards to the surface,
and so we solve the rotational diﬀusion equation with ab-
sorbing boundaries at the “horizon” where propulsion is
oriented outwards and the particle escapes. A particle
probes the cluster surface over the scale of its own diam-
eter (see Fig. 1), and we therefore estimate the horizon
angle as α(n) = 1

a homogeneous ﬂuid, while for 1 < zρg <

yond the ‘spinodal’), G(n) is monotonically decreasing
and the system is unstable towards cluster formation.

escape horizon. The cluster is approximated as a circle, and
points a and b lie on its boundary, separated vertically by
σ/2. The angle α represents the width of the “horizon” above
which a particle’s propulsion must point in order for it to es-
cape. Right: Eﬀective free energy as a function of the su-
persaturation zρg, in the single-phase region (black), at the
binodal (red), in the metastable region showing a nucleation
barrier (green), and in the spinodal regime (blue).

From this, we see that a geometric understanding of ABP
microdynamics leads naturally to their equilibrium-like
phase behavior. The ﬁrst term in Eq.(10) is proportional
to the cluster’s volume, and represents the diﬀerence in
eﬀective chemical potential between the dense and dilute
phases; i.e., the chemical potential of the cluster phase is
µc ∝ − ln z. While µc might be interpreted as an eﬀec-
tive attraction between particles, extension of the kinetic
model to include energetic interparticle attractions shows
that the relationship is subtle [69]. The second term is re-
lated to the cluster’s surface area, and can be interpreted
as a line tension that drives coarsening. This eﬀective line
tension is a positive constant, in contrast to a previous
result that suggests a negative line tension [66]. Solving
∆G(n) = 0 gives a prediction for the critical nucleus size
as ncrit = σ2ρc/π [ln(zρg)]2, a form familiar from classi-
cal nucleation theory. We note, however, that even prior
to nucleation ρg cannot be equated to the total particle
density, as is typically assumed in equilibrium CNT. Due
to the low eﬀective surface tension of this system, the
depletion of monomers by transient sub-critical clusters
cannot be neglected.

Next, we demonstrate that, despite its simpliﬁcations,
the theory provides quantitative insights into ABP sys-
tems. Our simulations are performed as in [41] (see [68]
for details), though to measure nucleation times much
larger than those accessible in brute force simulations,
we used the weighted-ensemble dynamics method [70–
72]. To compare the theory and simulations, we must
express the theoretical gas density ρg in terms of the
overall volume fraction φ, since the latter is the control
parameter in our NVT simulations. We do so via the
coordinate transformation [68]

computed from our kinetic theory. Black dots denote the
location of the binodal as measured from simulations, show-

prediction. Inset shows the critical nucleus size diverging as
zρg → 1, with good agreement between the exact calculation
(black line) and the approximate form derived in the main
text (orange points).

as measured by weighted ensemble dynamics simulations are
shown in black.

lation, we also use an empirical form for density within
large clusters, ρc(vp), which increases with propulsion
speed due to the imperfectly hard interaction potential
[68]. The resulting phase diagram is shown in Fig. 2. The
predicted binodal is remarkably close to its measured lo-
cation, although this could be partly fortuitous.

We now employ Eqs. (11) and (6) to compute the mean
nucleation time in the metastable regime. Here we ﬁnd
that the parameter-free theory lacks quantitative accu-
racy, primarily because the predicted nucleation rate is
exquisitely sensitive to small perturbations of zρg. To
enable qualitative comparisons, we set ρeﬀ

an ensemble average. Thus, we expect the outgoing rate
to scale with (cid:104)S(n)(cid:105) to leading order.

Directly measuring the rates conﬁrms deviation from
the n1/2 scaling expected for spherical clusters (Fig. 4).
Moreover, simulated rates are larger than predicted by
the theory, with the outgoing rates depending on vp.
This also results from the complex cluster geometry: on
small clusters or near regions of high curvature, particles
can escape by “sliding oﬀ” each other before completely
rotating to the horizon, thus resulting in a higher than
predicted, vp-dependent outgoing rate. Multi-particle es-
cape events may also contribute [41] As an additional
veriﬁcation, we fed the measured rates into Eq. 5 to re-
construct the CSDs, which showed good agreement with
simulation (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained else-
where in the phase diagram (see [68]). Thus, a more
detailed calculation of the rates should recover the scal-
ing of simulated CSDs. We may consider as an equilib-
rium analogue the Fisher droplet model [78], which shows
that accounting for the entropic contribution of cluster
surface ﬂuctuations leads to a power law in the CSD near
the critical point, with the exponent 31/15 ≈ 2.066 for
the 2D Ising universality class. (However, [79] obtains
an exponent of 1.70 ± 0.05 for a diﬀerent active matter
model.) Interestingly, the above discussion suggests that
accounting for interactions between clusters is not nec-
essary to explain the existence of power law scaling in
CSDs.

In summary, we have shown that an approach anal-
ogous to classical nucleation theory can describe the
nonequilibrium nucleation of clusters from solutions of
ABPs. By linking the microscopic parameters of ABPs
to their macroscale kinetics, this framework makes an
important step toward developing design principles for
applications of motility-induced phase separation.

While completing this manuscript, we learned of an-
other concurrent study which computationally measures
ABP nucleation rates [80]. By analyzing simulation tra-
jectories, they conclude that cluster size and cluster po-
larization (the extent to which particles on the rim of
a cluster point inwards) are important collective coordi-
nates for describing transition rates. These observations
are consistent with the kinetic theory described here.

potential. We ﬁnd (by eye) that setting χ = 0.71 pro-
duces good correspondence with simulation (Fig. 3). Nu-
cleation rates are notoriously diﬃcult to quantitatively
predict from ﬁrst principles even in the equilibrium case
(e.g.
[73–77]), and so the correspondence between the-
ory and simulation with a single small ﬁtting parameter
is notable.

Finally, we compare the theoretical and simulated
CSDs in Fig. 4. Below the binodal, the theory captures
the functional form of the CSDs, but in the metastable
region fails to account for a power law scaling ρn ∝ n−2
below a threshold cluster size. This discrepancy stems
in part from treating clusters as spherical. Though this
description captures many features of the phase separa-
tion kinetics, to understand the full CSDs the complex
geometric structure of the clusters is not ignorable. In
particular, simulations show clusters with ramiﬁed struc-
ture and fractal surface area scaling S(n)∼n0.64±0.01 [68].
In this case the outgoing ﬂux retains its basic form, but
must be averaged over cluster morphologies [68]:

A. Simulation Details

To validate the predicted cluster size distributions
(CSDs) and phase diagram, we performed Brownian dy-
namics simulations identical to those in [41]. To measure
the CSDs, we performed simulations with N = 30000
particles, run for 200τ . Particles are considered to be
bonded if their separation is less than σ, and clusters are
identiﬁed as groups of bonded particles [41, 69]. We ran
ﬁve simulations at each parameter set, discarded the ﬁrst
1τ of each trajectory, and averaged the results. We also
discarded frames in which any cluster containing more
than 1500 particles existed, to exclude phase-separated
conﬁgurations.

To locate the binodal, we ran similar simulations until
400τ and measured the density of the dilute phase, av-
eraging over ten separate simulations. In conﬁgurations
where clusters existed, we separately measured the den-
sity of the cluster interior (discarding the edge region)
and the density of the dilute phase (discarding the clus-
ter and surrounding boundary region). The empirical
form for ρc was determined in conjuction with these sim-
ulations. As shown in Fig. 5, the density of the cluster
interior was tabulated for various values of vp and the
resulting trend ﬁt to the functional form

ρc ≈ 1.1322 +(cid:112)0.00199vp − 0.08788.

Measurement of nucleation rates in simula-
tions. The rates of nucleation were determined using
the weighted-ensemble (WEBD) method [70–72], which
allows for precise rate measurement of extremely rare
events and is applicable to non-equilibrium dynamics.
We performed the calculation on systems of size N =
15000 and used the size of the largest cluster as our
progress coordinate. At the ﬁrst appearance of a clus-
ter of size n0 (usually chosen to be a few thousand), a
system was considered to have undergone a nucleation
event. In practice, this amounted running each ensemble
for about 160 and 2000 WEBD iterations, depending on
the rate of convergence. The bin boundaries were calcu-
lated separately for each WEBD run using the procedure
outlined in Ref. [70], Appendix C

B. Calculation of Nucleation Rate

We assume the cluster size distribution remains (quasi)
stationary, such that ∂tρn = 0 and therefore J(n) = J,
where J is a constant. Using the deﬁnition of J(n), this
implies

ρn+1 − bnρn = −

distribution was ﬁt to a power law (Fig. 6). A random
error of ±0.0013 was obtained by running 16 simulations
at the same point in phase space (vp = 100, φ = 0.29)
and taking the standard deviation of the measured scal-
ing exponent. Somewhat larger variations of about ±0.01
were observed as vp and φ were varied independently, but
without any obvious trend. Since such small variations
are irrelevant for our purposes, we take for the scaling
exponent the overall average 0.64 ± 0.01.

E. Measurement of evaporation and adsorption

rates

D. Surface Area Scaling

We formalize the measure of cluster surface area using
the notion of an α-shape, which deﬁnes a concave hull
of a set of points with respect to the spatial resolution
α [81]. By replacing each monomer with a constellation
of points on its surface and taking α to be the monomer
radius, the α-shape corresponds to the physically rele-
vant cluster surface. We performed the calculation using
the α-shape algorithm from the Computational Geome-
try Algorithms Library (CGAL), on conﬁgurations from
the simulations used to measure the cluster size distri-
butions. The surface area for clusters of each size n was

To measure evaporation and adsorption rates, simu-
lations were performed as described in Section I, but
without translational diﬀusion in order to avoid count-
ing events in which a monomer rapidly leaves and rejoins
a cluster. This is justiﬁed since we are working in the
regime where vpσ/D (cid:29) 1, such that any true evaporation
or adsorption event is unlikely to be caused by transla-
tional diﬀusion. Each simulation was run until 10τ , with
the ﬁrst 1τ of data discarded. To measure rates, a small
time interval ∆t = 0.0001τ was considered, during which
the probability of two evaporation or adsorption events
occuring simultaneously on the same cluster is low. If a
monomer was identiﬁed which ∆t units previously was
located on the boundary of a cluster of size n, one evapo-

ration event for that value of n was counted. Conversely,
if a cluster of size n was found with x monomers on its
boundary that previously did not belong to a cluster, x
adsorption events were counted. The number of events
was then summed to obtain average rates for each clus-
ter size. Results are given in Fig. 7 for zρg = 0.6 and
zρg = 1 (the binodal), together with a direct compari-
son to the rates predicted by the kinetic theory on the
binodal. Finally, the rates were inputted into the kinetic
theory from the main text in order to reconstruct the
CSDs. These results are presented in Fig. 8, showing
good agreement with simulation.

Eﬀects of cluster-cluster interactions. While the
CSDs computed from the measured rates ﬁt the simu-
lation CSDs very well for small and moderate cluster
sizes, they begin to deviate in the limit of large clus-
ters. This deviation likely arises because, for suﬃciently
high system densities, the growth of large clusters is no
longer dominanted by single monomer adsorption, as is
assumed in our theory. More precisely, we must consider
the general class of reaction pathways in which clusters
of sizes k and n − k combine to form a cluster of size
n, and k may range from 1 to (cid:98)n/2(cid:99). For large clus-
ters in dense systems, it may no longer be reliable to
ignore all reaction pathways in which k (cid:54)= 1. Thus, while
not directly responsible for the appearance of power law
scaling in the CSDs, cluster interactions appear to inﬂu-
ence the location of the threshold size characterizing the
crossover from power law scaling to exponential decay.
Indeed, it is surprising that our model, which assumes
non-interacting clusters, works as well as it does in the
high density region.

F. Derivation of the Coordinate Transformation

By deﬁnition of the overall volume fraction φ,

nmax(cid:88)

n=1

φ =

πσ2
4

In single phase regime or at the binodal, the sum in (26)
rigorously should be extended to ∞. However, for pur-
poses of numerical calculation, a suﬃciently accurate es-
timate is achieved for nmax = 1000. In the metastable
regime we assume that nucleation has not yet occured,
such that terms with large enough n do not contribute
to the sum.
In practice, we enforce this constraint by
setting nmax = min(ncrit, 1000). Inserting the expression
for the cluster size distribution, we get

By substitution into (30) we can therefore eliminate ρ1

use of the deﬁnition of ρg, which can be written as the

FIG. 7. Top left: Comparison of incoming and outgoing rates

the units are (monomers/cluster). Top right: Same as on the
