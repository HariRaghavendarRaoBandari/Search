2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation: 55U35, 14F05, 18D10, 18D30, 18E30, 18G99

Keywords: derivators, ﬁbered derivators, multiderivators, (op)ﬁbered 2-multicategories, six-functor-formalisms,

Grothendieck contexts, Wirthm¨uller contexts

Abstract

We deﬁne abstract six-functor-formalisms using the theory of (op)ﬁbrations of 2-multicategories.
We also give axioms for a Wirthm¨uller and Grothendieck formalism (where either f ! = f ∗ or
f! = f∗) or intermediate formalisms (where we have e.g. a natural morphism f! → f∗). A theory of a
derivator version of a six-functor-formalism is developed, using an extension of the notion of ﬁbered
multiderivator due to the author. Finally it is shown that a ﬁbered multiderivator (in particular
a closed monoidal derivator) is itself a six-functor-formalism on diagrams (small categories) in the
sense developed in this article. This gives, among other things, a considerable simpliﬁcation of the
axioms and of the proofs of basic properties, and clariﬁes the relation between the internal and
external monoidal products in a (closed) monoidal derivator.

Introduction

Six-functor-formalisms
Let S be a category, for instance a suitable category of schemes, topological spaces, analytic mani-
folds, etc. A Grothendieck six functor formalism on S consists of a collection of (derived) categories
DS, one for each “base space” S in S with the following six types of operations:

f ∗

f!

⊗

f∗

f !

for each f in Mor(S)

for each f in Mor(S)

HOM

in each ﬁber DS

The ﬁber DS is, in general, a derived category of “sheaves” over S, for example coherent sheaves,
l-adic sheaves, abelian sheaves, D-modules, motives, etc. The functors on the left hand side are left
adjoints of the functors on the right hand side. The functor f! and its right adjoint f ! are called
“push-forward with proper support”, and “exceptional pull-back”, respectively. The six functors
come along with the following isomorphisms between them and it is not easy to make their axioms
really precise.

Here f, g, F, G are morphisms in S which, in the (!,∗)-row, are related by the Cartesian diagram

Already in the previous article [13] we explained that a reasonable precise deﬁnition is the following:
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let S be a category with ﬁber products. A (symmetric) Grothendieck six-
functor-formalism on S is a 1-biﬁbration and 2-biﬁbration of (symmetric) 2-multicategories with
1-categorical ﬁbers

p ∶ D → S cor

where S cor is the symmetric 2-multicategory of correspondences in S (cf. Deﬁnition 3.1).

The push-forward along this 1-morphism corresponds in the classical language to the functor

f!((g∗

n−)).

Hence, from such a biﬁbration we obtain the operations f∗, f ∗ (resp. f !, f!) as pull-back and
push-forward along the correspondences

In [13] we showed that all compatibilities mentioned above follow from this deﬁnition.
We explain in Section 9 that enlarging the domain of 2-morphisms to all morphism or to a class
of “proper” or “etale” morphisms, respectively, one can easily encode all sorts of more strict six-
functor-formalisms, where either f! = f∗ or f ∗ = f ! for all morphisms (so called Grothendieck or
Wirthm¨uller contexts) or where we have canonical natural transformations f! → f∗ for all morphisms
f (such that the diagonal is “proper”) or canonical morphisms f ∗ → f ! for all morphisms f (such
that the diagonal is “etale”).
Deﬁnition 3.3 has the huge advantage that it also encodes all compatibilities between the isomor-
phisms above. For example, it is just a matter of contemplating a diagram of 2-morphisms in S cor
to see that the diagram

G! F ∗(A ⊗ g∗B)

Fibered multiderivators

For a detailed introduction to derivators and ﬁbered multiderivators we refer to the previous article
[13]. Stable derivators, among other things, simplify, enhance and conceptually explain triangulated
Instead of considering just one category, a derivator D speciﬁes a category D(I) for
categories.
each diagram shape I (small category), and pull-back functors α∗ ∶ D(J) → D(I) for each functor
α ∶ I → J. This has the advantage that a triangulation on the categories D(I) does not have to
be speciﬁed explicitly. Rather the operations of taking cones and shifting objects are encoded as
abstract homotopy limit and colimit functors, which are just left and right adjoints to certain of
the given pull-back functors. Triangles are reconstructed from squares, i.e. objects of D(◻) which
are Cartesian and coCartesian at the same time. All the axioms of triangulated categories are
consequences of a rather intuitive set of properties of Kan extensions.
A monoidal derivator speciﬁes in addition a monoidal structure on the categories D(I) which
satisﬁes some additional axioms as for example

α∗(−⊗ −) = ((α∗−) ⊗ (α∗−))

and

α!(−⊗ (α∗−)) = ((α!−) ⊗−)
for certain functors α. Together with the base change formula

β∗α! = B!A∗

for certain functors α, β, A, B forming a Cartesian square, this resembles a lot the datum and
axioms of a six-functor-formalism in which f ∗ = f !, i.e. a Wirthm¨uller context. By deﬁning a
certain 2-multicategory Diacor of multicorrespondences of diagrams we make this analogy precise
by showing the following general theorem. (Note that a monoidal derivator is the same as a left
ﬁbered multiderivator over {⋅}. )
Main theorem 5.8. Let D and S be pre-multiderivators satisfying (Dia1) and (Dia2) (cf. [13,
Deﬁnition 1.3.5.]). A strict morphism of pre-multiderivators D → S is a left (resp. right) ﬁbered
multiderivator if and only if Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is a 1-opﬁbration (resp. 1-ﬁbration) of 2-
multicategories.
Here Diacor(D) is deﬁned for any pre-multiderivator as an extension of the 2-multicategory of
correspondences of diagrams Diacor. We have Diacor = Diacor({⋅}). However it is not essential that
a pre-multiderivator is given a priori. For any 1-(op)ﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration D → Diacor(S) with
1-categorical ﬁbers a (non-strict) pre-multiderivator can be reconstructed (cf. 9.8).
Using the correspondence (cf. 2.15) between 1-opﬁbrations (and 2-ﬁbrations) of 2-multicategories
over Diacor(S) with 1-categorical ﬁbers and pseudo-functors Diacor(S) → CAT into the 2-multicategory

of all categories (where the multi-structure is given by multivalued functors) this formulation uniﬁes
in a nice way the two pseudofunctors

Dia(S)1−op → CAT

resp. Diaop(S)1−op → CAT

that have been associated with a ﬁbered multiderivator in [13], because there are embeddings of
Dia(S)1−op and Diaop(S)1−op into Diacor(S) (cf. 5.6–5.7).
For example, Ayoub had deﬁned in [1, 2] an algebraic derivator as a pseudo-functor Dia(S)1−op →
CAT satisfying certain axioms, mentioning that this involved a choice because Diaop(S) is an
equally justiﬁed forming. This problem led the author in [13] to the deﬁnition of a ﬁbered multi-
derivator instead of using Ayoub’s notion of algebraic derivator. The viewpoint in this article has
the advantage not only of clarifying the diﬀerence of these two viewpoints but also of encoding
most axioms of a ﬁbered multiderivator in a more elegant way.
The formal equalization of six-functor-formalisms and monoidal derivators explains many of their
similarities. For example, in both cases there is an internal monoidal product ⊗ (with adjoint
denoted Hom) and an external monoidal product ⊠ (with adjoint denoted HOM). The external
monoidal product and Hom are compatible with the one on S cor given by S ⊗ T = S × T and
Hom(S, T) = S × T , and with the one on Diacor given by I ⊗ J = I × J and Hom(I, J) = I op × J,
respectively. This is just a common feature of 1-/2- (op-)ﬁbrations of 2-multicategories: The notion
is transitive.
From the abstract properties of 1-/2- (op-)ﬁbrations of 2-multicategories we can derive that

E ⊗ F = ∆●(E ⊠ F),

Hom(E,F) = (∆′)●(HOM(E,F)),

and the external product, resp. external Hom, can also be reconstructed from the internal one in an
analogous way. For the meaning of ∆ and ∆′ see Section 8. Explicitly, the ﬁrst formula specializes
to:

E ⊗ F = ∆∗(E ⊠ F)

for the diagonal map ∆ ∶ S → S × S in the six-functor-formalism case, resp. ∆ ∶ I → I × I in the
monoidal derivator case. The second specializes to

Hom(E,F) = ∆!HOM(E,F)

in the six-functor-formalism case and to

in the monoidal derivator case, with the following functors:

Hom(E,F) = pr2,∗ π∗π∗HOM(E,F)

tw(I)

π /

/ I op × I

pr2 /

/ I.

The slightly diﬀerent behavior is due to the diﬀerent deﬁnitions of S cor and Diacor. The deﬁnition
of Diacor takes the 2-categorical nature of Dia into account. For the same reason, it encodes the
more complicated base change formula of derivators involving comma categories as opposed to the
simpler base change formula of a six-functor-formalism. And for the same reason the duality on
Diacor is not given by the identity S ↦ S as for S cor but by I ↦ I op.
The upshot is that the theory of 1-/2- (op-)ﬁbrations of 2-multicategories is suﬃciently powerful
to treat classical six-functor formalisms and monoidal (resp. multi-)derivators alike.

Derivator six-functor formalisms

However this is not the end of the story. Of course, classical six-functor-formalisms are mostly
deﬁned on families of triangulated categories. Fibered multi-derivator were deﬁned to extend and
simplify the latter. In the preceding article [13] we already explained how questions of cohomological
and homological descent can be treated nicely using this notion. Desirable is therefore a derivator
six-functor formalism which encodes not only the interplay of the “6 functors” but also of the
3 additional functors: pull-back along functors of diagrams, left Kan extension and right Kan
extension. One could say: a 9-functor-formalism. Yet the theory of 1-/2- (op-)ﬁbrations of 2-
multicategories is still suﬃciently powerful to deal with this situation. For this we have to deﬁne
2-pre-multiderivators. These are families of 2-multicategories rather than 1-multicategories. For
example, the 2-multicategory of multicorrespondences S cor has an associated 2-pre-multiderivator
Scor. A derivator six-functor-formalism, of course, should be a left and right ﬁbered multi-derivator
over Scor. The easiest way to make this precise (the deﬁnition given in our previous article [13] does
not deal with 2-pre-multiderivators yet) is to mimic Main Theorem 5.8 mentioned above. Given a
2-pre-multiderivator D we construct again an extension Diacor(D) of Diacor and deﬁne
Deﬁnition 7.3. Let S be a 2-pre-multiderivator where all 2-morphisms are invertible.
Let D → S be a strict morphism of 2-pre-multiderivators (Deﬁnition 6.2) satisfying (Der1) and
(Der2) each (cf. 6.3) is called a left (resp. right) ﬁbered multiderivator if the strict functor
of 2-multicategories

Diacor(D) → Diacor(S)

of Deﬁnition 7.2 is a 1-opﬁbration (resp. 1-ﬁbration) and 2-isoﬁbration with 1-categorical ﬁbers.
Similarly we deﬁne symmetric and braided (left or right) ﬁbered multiderivators.

Deﬁnition 7.6. We deﬁne a (symmetric) derivator six-functor-formalism as a left and right
ﬁbered (symmetric) multiderivator

D → Scor.

Actually to treat also derivator Grothendieck and Wirthm¨uller contexts as well as derivator “proper”
and “etale” six-functor-formalisms we have to deﬁne more generally a theory of lax and oplax
left (resp. right) ﬁbered multiderivators (cf. Deﬁnitions 7.4–7.5). In Section 10 we explain
that in this language the appearance of distinguished triangles like

j!j!E

/ E

/ j∗j

∗E [1]

for an open immersion j and its complementary closed immersion j can be treated elegantly.
Actually there are four ﬂavours of these sequences, two for proper derivator six-functor-formalisms,
and two for etale derivator six-functor-formalisms. More generally, a sequence of open embeddings

leads immediately to so called (n+ 1)-angles in the sense of [8, §13] in the ﬁbre over Xn which is a
usual stable derivator.

Overview

This article is rather foundational. It develops in sections 1 and 2 the basics of 1-/2- (op)ﬁbrations
of 2-multicategories which do not appear in the literature in this form. This is an extension and

uniﬁcation of existing work [3, 4, 10–12]. In Section 3 the 2-multicategory of correspondences S cor
is deﬁned, and it is explained how classical six-functor-formalisms can be encoded as certain 1-
biﬁbrations of 2-multicategories over S cor. In Section 4 the 2-multicategory of correspondences of
diagrams Diacor is deﬁned, which is slightly more complicated because it has to take the 2-categorical
ﬂavour of Dia into account. In Section 5 it is explained that the notion of certain 1-biﬁbrations of 2-
multicategories over Diacor(S) is basically equivalent to a ﬁbered multiderivator over S. In Section 6
the notion of 2-pre-multiderivator is developed, leading to the deﬁnition of a ﬁbered multiderivator
over such in section 7. This is the abstract framework for derivator six-functor-contexts. Their
construction (for classical contexts like coherent sheaves on schemes, or Abelian sheaves on nice
topological spaces) will be the content of a subsequent article.
In this article we only explain
how to construct representable ﬁbered multiderivators associated with a given 1-biﬁbration (and
2-isoﬁbration) of 2-multicategories with 1-categorical ﬁbers (cf. Proposition 7.8).

1

2-Multicategories

The notion of 2-multicategory is a straight-forward generalization of the notion of 2-category. For
lack of reference and because we want to stick to the case of (strict) 2-categories as opposed to
bicategories, we list the relevant deﬁnitions here:
Deﬁnition 1.1. A 2-multicategory D consists of

• a class of objects Ob(D);
• for every n ∈ Z≥0, and objects X1, . . . , Xn, Y in Ob(D) a category

Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y );

• a composition, i.e. for objects X1, . . . , Xn, Y1, . . . , Ym, Z in Ob(D) and for each integer 1 ≤

i ≤ m a functor:
Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Yi) × Hom(Y1, . . . , Ym; Z) → Hom(Y1, . . . , Yi−1, X1, . . . , Xn, Yi+1, . . . , Ym; Z);

• for each object X ∈ Ob(D) an identity object idX in the category Hom(X; X);

satisfying strict associativity and identity laws. A symmetric (braided) 2-multicategory is given by
an action of the symmetric (braid) groups, i.e. isomorphisms of categories
α ∶ Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ) → Hom(Xα(1), . . . , Xα(n); Y )

for α ∈ Sn (resp. α ∈ Bn) forming an action which is strictly compatible with composition in the
obvious way (substitution of strings in the braid group).

The 1-composition of 2-morphisms is (as for usual 2-categories) determined by the following whisker-
ing operations: Let f, g ∈ Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Yi) and h ∈ Hom(Y1, . . . , Ym; Z) be 1-morphisms and let
µ ∶ f ⇒ g be a 2-morphism in Mor(Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Yi)). Then we deﬁne

h ∗ µ ∶= idh ⋅µ

where the right hand side is the image of the 2-morphism idh ×µ under the composition functor.
Similarly we deﬁne µ∗ h for µ ∶ f ⇒ g with f, g ∈ Hom(Y1, . . . , Ym; Z) and h ∈ Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Yi).

7

Deﬁnition 1.2. A pseudo-functor F ∶ C → D between 2-multicategories is given by the following
data:

• for each object X ∈ Ob(C) an object F(X) ∈ Ob(C);
• for each X1, . . . , Xn; Y objects of C, a functor

Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ) → Hom(F(X1), . . . , F(Xn); F(Y ));

• for each object X ∈ Ob(C) a 2-isomorphism

FX ∶ F(idX) ⇒ idF (X);

• for each collection X1, . . . , Xn; Y1, . . . , Ym; Z and i ∈ {1, . . . , m} a natural isomorphism

F−,− ∶ F(−) ○i F(−) ⇒ F(− ○i −)

of functors

Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Yi) × Hom(Y1, . . . , Ym; Z)

→ Hom(F(Y1), . . . , F(Yi−1), F(X1), . . . , F(Xn), F(Yi+1), . . . , F(Ym); F(Z));

satisfying

FidY ,f = FY ∗ F(f)

Fg,idYi

= F(g) ∗ FYi

for f ∈ Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ), and for g ∈ Hom(Y1, . . . , Ym; Z), respectively, and for composable
f, g, h that

F(h) ○j F(g) ○i F(f) F (h)∗Fg,f

F(h) ○j F(g ○i f)

Fh,g∗F (f)

F(h ○j g) ○i F(f)

Fhg,f

Fh,gf

/ F(h ○j g ○i f)

commutes. A pseudo functor is called a strict functor if all Fg,f and FX are identities.
Deﬁnition 1.3. A pseudo-natural transformation α ∶ F1, . . . , Fm ⇒ G between pseudo-functors
F1, . . . , Fm; G ∶ C → D is given by the following data:

• for each object X ∈ Ob(C) a morphism α(X) ∈ Hom(F1(X), . . . , Fm(X); G(X));
• for each morphism f ∈ Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ) a 2-isomorphism

αf ∶ α(Y ) ○ (F1(f), . . . , Fm(f)) ⇒ G(f) ○ (α(X1), . . . , α(Xn));

satisfying

• for f ∈ Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Yi) and g ∈ Hom(Y1, . . . , Yk; Z) the following diagram commutes

α(Z)(F1(g)F1(f ), . . . , Fm(g)Fm(f ))

/ G(g) ⋅ (α(X1), . . . , α(Xn))

Similarly we deﬁne an oplax natural transformation, if the morphism αf is no longer required
to be a 2-isomorphism but can be any 2-morphism. We deﬁne a lax natural transformation
requiring that the morphism αf goes in the other direction, with the diagrams above changed suitably.
Deﬁnition 1.4. A modiﬁcation µ ∶ α ⇛ β between α, β ∶ F1, . . . , Fm ⇒ G (pseudo-, lax-, or
oplax-) natural transformations is given by the following data:

• For each object X a 2-morphism

µX ∶ α(X) ⇒ β(X)

such that for each morphism f ∈ Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ) the following diagram commutes

α(Y ) ○ (F1(f), . . . , Fm(f))

resp. the analogue diagram with the horizontal arrows reversed.
Lemma 1.5. Let C, D be 2-multicategories. Then the collection

Fun(C,D)

of pseudo-functors, pseudo-natural transformations and modiﬁcations forms a 2-multicategory. Sim-
ilarly the collections

Funlax(C,D)

Funoplax(C,D)

of pseudo-functors, (op)lax natural transformations and modiﬁcations form 2-multicategories.

Proof. We leave the proof to the reader, but will explicitly spell out how pseudo-natural transfor-
mations are composed:
Let α ∶ F1, . . . , Fm ⇒ Gi and β ∶ G1, . . . , Gn ⇒ H be pseudo-natural transformations. Then the
pseudo-natural transformation

(Op)ﬁbrations of 2-multicategories

Material about (op)ﬁbrations of (usual) multicategories can be found in [11, 12]; material about
(op)ﬁbrations of 2-categories in [3, 4, 10]. The deﬁnitions in this section however are slightly
diﬀerent from those in any of these sources.

2.1. Let

A

C

⇙µ

B

/ D

be a 2-commutative diagram of (usual) categories, where µ is a natural isomorphism. Then we say
that the diagram is 2-Cartesian if it induces an equivalence

A ≅ A ×∼

~D B.

If µ is an identity then the diagram is said to be Cartesian, if it induces an equivalence of categories

Lemma 2.2. If

A ≅ A ×D B.

A

B

F

/ D

is a commutative diagram of categories, and F is an iso-ﬁbration (i.e. the corresponding functor
between the groupoids of isomorphisms is a ﬁbration or equivalently an opﬁbration) then the two
notions

2-Cartesian and Cartesian

are equivalent.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let p ∶ D → S be a strict functor of 2-multicategories. A 1-morphism

• p is called a 2-opﬁbration of 2-multicategories if the functors
Hom(E1, . . . ,En;F) → Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T)

are Grothendieck opﬁbrations and the composition functors in D are morphisms of Grothendieck
opﬁbrations.

• p is called a 1-ﬁbration of 2-multicategories if for all 1-morphisms f ∈ HomS(S1, . . . , Sn; T)
and all i = 1, . . . , n and all objects E1, ̂i. . .,En;F with p(Ek) = Sk and p(F) = T there is an object
Ei with p(Ei) = Si and a Cartesian 1-morphism w.r.t. the i-th slot in Homf(E1, . . . ,En;F).

• p is called a 2-ﬁbration of 2-multicategories if the functors

Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ) → Hom(p(X1), . . . , p(Xn); p(Y ))

are Grothendieck ﬁbrations and the composition functors in D are morphisms of Grothendieck
ﬁbrations.

• Similarly we deﬁne the notions of 1-biﬁbration and 2-biﬁbration.
• Let S be an object in S. The 2-category consisting of those objects, 1-morphisms, and 2-
morphisms which p maps to S, idS and ididS respectively is called the ﬁber DS of p above
S.

• We say that p has 1-categorical ﬁbers, if all ﬁbers DS are 1-categories.
• p is called a 2-isoﬁbration if p induces a 2-ﬁbration (or equivalently a 2-opﬁbration) when

restricted to the strict 2-functor

D2−∼ → S 2−∼

where the 2-morphisms sets are the subsets of 2-isomorphisms in D and S, respectively.
Obviously every 2-ﬁbration (or 2-opﬁbration) is a 2-isoﬁbration.

Note that (by Lemma 2.2) for 2-isoﬁbrations, we could have deﬁned (co)Cartesian 1-morphisms
equivalently using the notion of Cartesian diagram instead of 2-Cartesian diagram.
Lemma 2.6. A 2-isoﬁbration of 2-multicategories p ∶ D → S is a 1-ﬁbration if and only if the
following two conditions hold:

1. for all 1-morphisms f ∈ HomS(S1, . . . , Sn; T) and all i = 1, . . . , n and all objects E1, ̂i. . .,En;F
with p(Ek) = Sk and p(F) = T there is an object Ei with p(Ei) = Si and a weakly Cartesian
1-morphism w.r.t. the i-th slot in Homf(E1, . . . ,En;F);

2. the composition of weakly Cartesian 1-morphisms is weakly Cartesian.

A similar statement holds for 1-opﬁbrations where it is important that the Cartesian morphisms
are composed w.r.t. the correct slot (otherwise see 2.7).
Proof. Let f ∈ HomS(S1, . . . , Sn; T), and let ξ ∈ Homf(E1, . . . ,En;F) be a weakly coCartesian
morphism with p(ξ) = f . We have to show that ξ is coCartesian, i.e. that the diagram of categories

Hom(F1, . . . ,Fm;G) ○iξ

is 2-Cartesian, where the notation is as in the deﬁnition of coCartesian 1-morphism. To see that
the corresponding functor to the iso-comma category is essentially surjective, consider a morphism

h ∈ Hom(F1, . . . ,Fi−1,E1, . . . ,En,Fi+1, . . . ,Fm;G)

and g ∈ Hom(T1, . . . , Tm; U) together with a 2-isomorphism
η ∶ g ○ f ⇒ p(h).

Then choose a weakly coCartesian 1-morphism ξ′ ∈ Hom(F1, . . . ,Fn;F ′) over g. Since also the
composition ξ′ ○ ξ is weakly coCartesian, we have a 2-commutative diagram:

G

The morphism ̃h○ξ′ therefore is a 1-morphism in Hom(F1, . . . ,Fm;G) such that p(̃hξ′) is isomorphic
to g and such that the compositon with ξ is isomorphic to h. To see that the corresponding functor
to the Iso-comma category is fully-faithful one proceeds analogously using an auxiliary weakly
coCartesian morphism ξ′.
For the converse one needs the assumption that p is a 2-isoﬁbration.
Lemma 2.7. Let i ∈ {1, 2}. Let p ∶ D → S be an i-(op)ﬁbration between 2-multicategories. Then
the composition of (co)Cartesian i-morphisms is (co)Cartesian. For Cartesian 1-morphisms this
holds true only if the slot w.r.t. which the morphisms are composed agrees with the slot w.r.t. which
the second morphism is Cartesian. Otherwise we have the following statement: If p ∶ D → S is
a 1-biﬁbration of 2-multicategories, and ξ ∈ Hom(E1, . . . ,En;Fj) is a coCartesian 1-morphism and
µ ∈ Hom(F1, . . . ,Fm;G) is a Cartesian 1-morphism w.r.t. the k-th slot then the composition

µ ○j ξ ∈ Hom(F1, . . . ,Fj−1,E1, . . . ,En,Fj+1, . . . ,Fm;G)

is Cartesian w.r.t. the k-th slot if k < j and w.r.t. the k + n − 1-th slot if k > j. (This holds true in
particular also in the case n = 0).

2.8. Recall the deﬁnition of pseudo-functor between strict 2-categories, pseudo-natural transfor-
mations, and modiﬁcations (Deﬁnitions 1.2–1.4). Let F , G be pseudo-functors. A pseudo-natural
transformation ξ ∶ F → G is called an equivalence if there are a pseudo-natural transformation
η ∶ G → F , and modiﬁcations (isomorphisms) ξ ○ η ≅ idG, and η ○ ξ ≅ idF .
Lemma 2.9. A pseudo-natural transformation ξ ∶ F → G is an equivalence if and only if

ξX ∶ F(X) → G(X)

is an equivalence in the target-2-category for any X. In other words, choosing a point-wise in-
verse sets up automatically a pseudo-natural transformation as well, and the point-wise natural
transformations between the compositions constitute the required modiﬁcations.

Deﬁnition 2.10. Recall that an object E in a strict 2-category deﬁnes a strict 2-functor

Hom(E,−) ∶ D → CAT

F ↦ Hom(E,F)

A pseudo-functor from a 2-category D

F ∶ D → CAT

is called representable if there is an object E and a pseudo-natural transformation

ν ∶ F → Hom(E,−)

which is an equivalence, cf. 2.8.
Lemma 2.11. An object E which represents a functor F is determined up to equivalence.
Proof. We have to show that every pseudo-natural transformation

ξ ∶ Hom(E,−) → Hom(E ′,−)

which has an inverse η up to modiﬁcation, induces an equivalence E → E ′. Let η be the quasi-inverse
of ξ. We have a 2-commutative diagram

Hom(E,E ′)

ξE′

Hom(E ′,E ′)

ξE (idE )○−

ξE (idE )○−

Hom(E,E)

ξE

by the deﬁnition of pseudo-natural transformation. Hence also a 2-commutative diagram:

Hom(E,E ′)

ξE (idE )○−

Hom(E,E)

ηE′

ηE

Hom(E ′,E ′)

ξE (idE )○−

Hom(E ′,E)

In particular, we get 2-isomorphisms

ξE(idE) ○ ηE′(idE′) ⇒ ηE(ξE(idE)) ⇒ idE

where the second one comes from the fact that η and ξ are inverse to each other up to 2-isomorphism.
Similarly, there is a 2-isomorphism

Hence we get the required equivalence

ηE′(idE′) ○ ξE(idE) ⇒ idE′ .

The previous lemma shows that the following deﬁnition makes sense:
Deﬁnition 2.12. For an 1-opﬁbration the objects F in the deﬁnition of coCartesian 1-morphism
(cf. Deﬁnition 2.3) are denoted by f●(E1, . . . ,En). They are uniquely determined up to equivalence
in DT .
Note, e.g., that for two diﬀerent objects f●(E1, . . . ,En) and f○(E1, . . . ,En) each representing the
2-functor

F ↦ Homf(E1, . . . ,En;F)

on the 2-category DT , we get an equivalence f●(E1, . . . ,En) ↔ f○(E1, . . . ,En) by the lemma.
2.13. The 2-category CAT has a natural structure of 2-multicategory setting

Hom(C1, . . . ,Cn;D) = Fun(C1 × ⋯ × Cn,D).

CAT is obviously opﬁbered over {⋅} with the monoidal product given by the product of categories
and with the ﬁnal category as neutral element.

Deﬁnition 2.14 (2-categorical Grothendieck construction). For a pseudo-functor

Ξ ∶ S → CAT

where CAT is equipped with the structure of 2-multicategory of 2.13, we get a 2-multicategory DΞ
and a strict functor

DΞ → S

which is 1-opﬁbered and 2-ﬁbered and whose ﬁbers are isomorphic to Ξ(S) (hence are 1-categories),
as follows: The objects of DΞ are pairs

(E, S)

where S is an object of S, E is an object of Ξ(S). The 1-morphisms in

Hom((E1, S1), . . . ,(En, Sn);(F , T))

are pairs (α, f) where f ∈ Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T) is a 1-morphism in S and α ∶ Ξ(f)(E1, . . . ,En) → F
is a morphism in Ξ(T). The 2-morphisms

ν ∶ (α, f) ⇒ (β, g)
are those 2-morphisms ν ∶ f ⇒ g such that β ○ Ξ(ν) = α.
Proposition 2.15. For a strict functor between 2-multicategories p ∶ D → S which is 1-opﬁbered
and 2-ﬁbered (with 1-categorical ﬁbers), we get an associated pseudo-functor of 2-multicategores:

ΞD ∶ S → CAT
S ↦ DS

The construction is inverse (up to isomorphism of pseudo-functors, resp. 1-opﬁbrations/2-ﬁbrations)
to the one given in the previous deﬁnition.
Corollary 2.16. The concept of functors between 1-multicategories p ∶ D → {⋅} which are (1-)opﬁbered
is equivalent to the concept of a monoidal category. The functor is, in addition, (1-)ﬁbered if the
corresponding monoidal category is closed.

15

2.17. For a strict functor between 2-multicategories p ∶ D → S which is 1-opﬁbered and 2-opﬁbered
but with arbitrary 2-categorical ﬁbers, and every f ∈ Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T) and E1, . . . ,En we get still
an object

f●(E1, . . . ,En)

which is well-deﬁned up to equivalence. This deﬁnes a certain kind of pseudo-3-functor

S → 2 − CAT .

Since this becomes confusing and we will not need it, we will not go into any details of this. For
example, if S = {⋅} then a 2-multicategory D which is 1-opﬁbered and 2-opﬁbered over {⋅} is the
same as a monoidal 2-category in the sense of [6, 9, 14, 16].

Example 2.18. Let S be a usual category. Then S may be turned into a symmetric multicategory
by setting

Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ) ∶= Hom(X1; Y ) × ⋯ × Hom(Xn; Y ).

If S has coproducts, then S (with this multicategory structure) is opﬁbered over {⋅}. Let p ∶ D → S be
an opﬁbered (usual) category. Then a multicategory structure on D which turns p into an opﬁbration
w.r.t. this multicategory structure on S, is equivalent to a monoidal structure on the ﬁbers such
that the push-forwards f● are monoidal functors and such that the compatibility morphisms between
them are morphisms of monoidal functors. This is called a covariant monoidal pseudo-functor in
[15, (3.6.7)].

Example 2.19. Let S be a usual category. Then S op may be turned into a symmetric multicategory
(or equivalently S into a symmetric opmulticategory) by setting

Hom(X1, . . . , Xn; Y ) ∶= Hom(Y ; X1) × ⋯ × Hom(Y ; Xn).

If S has products then S op (with this multicategory structure) is opﬁbered over {⋅}. Let p ∶ D → S op
be an opﬁbered (usual) category. Then a multicategory structure on D which turns p into an
opﬁbration w.r.t. this multicategory structure on S op, is equivalent to a monoidal structure on
the ﬁbers such that pull-backs f ∗ (along morphisms in S) are monoidal functors and such that
the compatibility morphisms between them are morphisms of monoidal functors. This is called a
contravariant monoidal pseudo-functor in [15, (3.6.7)].
Lemma 2.20. Let p ∶ D → S be a strict functor of 2-multicategories. Any equivalence in D is a
Cartesian and coCartesian 1-morphism.

Proof. An equivalence F → F ′ has the property that the composition
Hom(E1, . . . ,En;F) → Hom(E1, . . . ,En;F ′)

is an equivalence of categories. We hence get a commutative diagram of categories

Hom(E1, . . . ,En;F)

Hom(E1, . . . ,En;F ′)

Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T)

/ Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T ′)

where the two horizontal morphisms are equivalences. It is automatically 2-Cartesian.

Lemma 2.21. Let p ∶ D → S be a strict functor of 2-multicategories. If ξ ∈ HomD(E1, . . . ,En;F) is
a (co)Cartesian 1-morphism and α ∶ ξ ⇒ ξ′ is a 2-isomorphism in D, then ξ′ is (co)Cartesian as
well.

Proof. α induces a natural isomorphism between the functor ‘composition with ξ’ and the functor
‘composition with ξ′’. p(α) induces a natural isomorphism between the functor ‘composition with
p(ξ)’ and the functor ‘composition with p(ξ′)’. Therefore the diagram expressing the coCartesianity
of ξ is 2-Cartesian if and only if the corresponding diagram for ξ′ is 2-Cartesian.
2.22. Consider 2-multicategories D, S, S′ and a diagram

D

F

where p is a strict functor and F is a pseudo-functor. We deﬁne the pull-back of p along F as the
following 2-multicategory F ∗D:

1. The objects of F ∗D are pairs of objects F ∈ D and S ∈ S′ such that p(F) = F(S).
2. 1-morphisms are pairs of a 1-morphism α ∈ Hom(F1, . . . ,Fn;G) and a 1-morphism β ∈

Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T) and a 2-isomorphism

(p(F1), . . . , p(Fn))

3. The 2-morphisms (α, β, γ) ⇒ (α′, β′, γ′) are 2-morphisms µ ∶ α ⇒ α′ and ν ∶ β ⇒ β′ such that

γ′p(µ) = F(ν)γ.

4. Composition for the γ’s is given by the following pasting (here depicted for 1-ary morphisms):

p(α2α1)

p(F) p(α1)

p(F ′) p(α2)

p(F ′′)

⇓γ1

⇓γ2

⇓Fβ2,β1
F (β2β1)

Here Fβ2,β1 is the 2-isomorphism given by the pseudo-functoriality of F (cf. Deﬁnition 1.2).
Associativity follows from the axioms of a pseudo-functor.

We get a commutative diagram of 2-multicategories

Proposition 2.23. If p is a 1-ﬁbration (resp. 1-opﬁbration, resp. 2-ﬁbration, resp. 2-opﬁbration)
then F ∗p is a 1-ﬁbration (resp. 1-opﬁbration, resp. 2-ﬁbration, resp. 2-opﬁbration).

Proof. We show the proposition for 1-opﬁbrations and 2-opﬁbrations. The other statements are
shown similarly. By the deﬁnition of pull-back the following diagram identiﬁes the category in the
upper left corner with the Iso-comma category

HomF ∗A((S1,F1), . . . ,(Sm,Fm);(T,G))

where S1, . . . , Sm, T are objects of S and F1, . . . ,Fm,G are objects of D such that F(Si) = p(Fi)
and F(T) = p(G). Hence if p is an opﬁbration then so is F ∗p. Furthermore a 2-morphism in F ∗A,
i.e. a morphism in the category HomF ∗A((T1,F1), . . . ,(Tm,Fm);(U,G)) is coCartesian for F ∗p, if
and only if its image in HomA(F1, . . . ,Fm;G) is coCartesian for p.
Let f ∈ Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T) be a 1-morphism in S′ and E1, . . . ,En be objects of D such that F(Si) =
p(Ei). Choose a coCartesian 1-morphism ξ ∈ HomA(E1, . . . ,En;F) over F(f) and consider the
corresponding morphism

F ∗ξ ∈ HomF ∗A((S1,F1), . . . ,(Sm,Fm);(T,F))

over f . We will show that F ∗ξ is 1-coCartesian for F ∗D → S′. Consider the following 2-commutative
diagram of categories (we omitted the natural isomorphisms which occur in the left, right, bottom
and top faces):

The back face of the cube is 2-Cartesian by the deﬁnition of coCartesian for ξ. The left and right
face of the cube are 2-Cartesian by the deﬁnition of pull-back. Therefore also the front face is
2-Cartesian, and hence F ∗ξ is a Cartesian 1-morphism.
Furthermore for the composition with any (not necessarily coCartesian) 1-morphism we may draw
a similar diagram and have to show that if the back face is a morphism of opﬁbrations then the
front face is a morphism of opﬁbrations. This follows from the characterization of coCartesian
2-morphisms in the beginning of the proof.
Proposition 2.24. If p1 ∶ E → D and p2 ∶ D → S are 1-ﬁbrations (resp. 1-opﬁbrations, resp.
2-ﬁbrations, resp. 2-opﬁbrations) of 2-multicategories then the composition p2 ○ p1 ∶ E → S is a
1-ﬁbration, (resp. 1-opﬁbration, resp. 2-ﬁbration, resp. 2-opﬁbration) of 2-multicategories. An i-
morphism ξ is (co)Cartesian w.r.t. p2 ○ p1 if and only if it is i-(co)Cartesian w.r.t. p1 and p1(ξ) is
i-(co)Cartesian w.r.t. p2.
Proof. Let ξ ∈ HomE(C1, . . . , Cn; Ai) be a 1-morphism which is coCartesian for p1 and such that
p1(ξ) is coCartesian for p2. Then we have the following diagram

Hom(A1, . . . , Am; B) ○iξ

Hom(A1, . . . , Ai−1, C1, . . . , Cn, Ai+1, . . . , Am; B)

(1)

Hom(F1, . . . ,Fm;G) ○ip1(ξ)

Hom(F1, . . . ,Fi−1,E1, . . . ,En,Fi+1, . . . ,Fm;G)

Hom(T1, . . . , Tm; U) ○ip2(ξ)

/ Hom(T1, . . . , Ti−1, S1, . . . , Sn, Ti+1, . . . , Tm; U)

in which both small rectangles commute and are 2-Cartesian. Hence also the composite is 2-
Cartesian, that is, ξ is coCartesian for p2 ○ p1.
Let f ∈ HomS(S1, . . . , Sn; T) be a 1-morphism and C1, . . . , Cn be objects of E over S1, . . . , Sn.
Choose a coCartesian 1-morphism µ ∈ HomD(p(C1), . . . , p(Cn);Fi) in D over f . Choose a co-
Cartesian 1-morphism (for p1) ξ ∈ HomD(C1, . . . , Cn; Ai) over µ. We have seen before that ξ is
coCartesian for p2 ○ p1 as well.
i) be a diﬀerent coCartesian 1-morphism for p2 ○ p1 over f . We still
Let ξ′ ∈ HomD(C1, . . . , Cn; A′
have to prove the implication that ξ′ is coCartesian for p1 and that p1(ξ′) is coCartesian for p2.
By Lemma 2.11 there is an equivalence α ∶ A′
i → Ai such that ξ′ is isomorphic to α○ ξ. Then p1(ξ′)
is isomorphic to p1(α) ○ µ. The 1-morphism α ○ ξ is coCartesian for p1, being a composition of
coCartesian 1-morphisms for p1 (cf. Lemma 2.7 and Lemma 2.20). Therefore, by Lemma 2.21, also
ξ′ is coCartesian for p1, and hence p1(α) ○ µ is a composition of coCartesian morphisms for p2.
Therefore, by Lemma 2.21, also p1(ξ′) coCartesian for p2.

There is a certain converse to the previous proposition:
Proposition 2.25. Let p1 ∶ E → D and p2 ∶ D → S be 2-isoﬁbrations of 2-multicategories. Then
p1 ∶ E → D is a 1-ﬁbration (resp. 1-opﬁbration), if the following conditions hold:

1. p2 is a 1-ﬁbration (resp. 1-opﬁbration)
2. p2 ○ p1 is a 1-ﬁbration (resp. 1-opﬁbration)

3. p1 is a morphism of 1-ﬁbrations (resp. 1-opﬁbrations), i.e. it maps (co)Cartesian 1-morphisms

w.r.t. p2 ○ p1 to (co)Cartesian 1-morphisms w.r.t. p2.

4. (co)Cartesianity of 1-morphisms in the ﬁbers of p1 is stable under pull-back (resp. push-

forward) w.r.t. p2 ○ p1.
More precisely (for the opﬁbered case, the other case is similar): For a morphism f ∈
Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T), objects Ei over Si, and morphisms τi ∶ Ei → Fi over idSi, consider a
diagram in D

over the other two, the following holds true: If κ and κ′ are Cartesian 1-morphisms w.r.t.
p2 ○ p1 and if µ1, . . . , µn are coCartesian 1-morphisms w.r.t. p1 then also ν is a coCartesian
1-morphism w.r.t. p1.

Proof. We have to show that 1-coCartesian morphisms exist. For simplicity of notation we will
show the statement neglecting the multi-aspect.
Let τ ∶ E → F be a 1-morphism over f ∶ S → T and let Ξ be an object over E. Choose a 1-coCartesian
morphism ξ ∶ Ξ → Ξ′ over f . By property 3. we have that p1(ξ) ∶ E → E ′ is 1-coCartesian over f as
well. We therefore have an induced 1-morphism ̃τ ∶ E ′ → F over idT and a 2-isomorphism

Now choose 1-coCartesian morphisms ξ′ ∶ Ξ′ → Ξ′′ w.r.t. p1,T ∶ ET → DT over ̃τ . We claim that

is 1-Cartesian over τ . Using Lemma 2.21 this is equivalent to ξ′○ξ being 1-coCartesian over ̃τ ○p(ξ).
Using diagram (1) from the proof of the previous proposition we see that ξ is 1-coCartesian for
p1 as well. Since the composition of 1-coCartesian morphisms is 1-coCartesian we are left to show
that ξ′ is 1-coCartesian for p1. Let f ∶ T → U be a morphism and Σ an object over G over U . We
have to show that

η ∶ ̃τ ○ p1(ξ) ⇒ τ.

3 Correspondences in a category and abstract six-functor for-

ﬁber products have been chosen in S.
Deﬁnition 3.1. We deﬁne the category S cor of correspondences (or spans) in S to be the
following 2-multicategory.

1. The objects are the objects of S.
2. The 1-morphisms Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; T) are the (multi-)correspondences

is the composition w.r.t. the i-th slot of the left correspondence in Hom(S1, . . . , Sn; Ti) and
the right correspondence Hom(T1, . . . , Tm; W).

This 2-multicategory is symmetric, representable (i.e. opﬁbered over {⋅}), closed (i.e. ﬁbered over
{⋅}) and self-dual, with tensor product and internal hom both given by the product × in S and
having as unit the ﬁnal object of S.
Deﬁnition 3.2. We deﬁne also the larger category S cor,G where in addition every morphism γ ∶
U → U ′ such that the above diagrams commute is a 2-morphism (i.e. γ does not necessarily have
to be an isomorphism).

We extend the Deﬁnition from [13, Deﬁnition A.2.16] (cf. Section 9 for an explanation of the
terminology).
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let S be a category with ﬁber products and ﬁnal object. A (symmetric) Grothendieck
six-functor-formalism on S is a 1-biﬁbered 2-biﬁbered (symmetric) 2-multicategory with 1-categorical
ﬁbers

p ∶ D → S cor.

A (symmetric) Grothendieck context on S is a 1-biﬁbered 2-ﬁbered (symmetric) 2-multicategory
with 1-categorical ﬁbers

p ∶ D → S cor,G.

A (symmetric) Wirthm¨uller context on S is a 1-biﬁbered 2-opﬁbered (symmetric) 2-multicategory
with 1-categorical ﬁbers

p ∶ D → S cor,G.

Sometimes, if we are given a class of “proper” (resp. “etale”) morphisms S0 in S, it
3.4.
is convenient to deﬁne S cor,0 to be the category where the morphisms γ ∶ U → U ′ entering the
deﬁnition of 2-morphism are the morphisms in S0. Then we would consider a 1-biﬁbration

p ∶ D → S cor,0

which is a 2-ﬁbration in the proper case and a 2-opﬁbration in the etale case. We call this a (sym-
metric) proper six-functor-formalism and a (symmetric) etale six-functor-formalism,
respectively.
3.5. We have a morphism of opﬁbered (over {⋅}) symmetric multicategories S op → S cor where
S op is equipped with the symmetric multicategory structure as in 2.19. However there is no rea-
sonable morphism of opﬁbered multicategories S → S cor where S is equipped with the symmetric
multicategory structure as in 2.18. (There is no compatibility involving only ‘⊗’ and ‘!’.) From a

D is monoidal.
It is easy to derive (cf. Section 8) from the deﬁnition of biﬁbered multicategory over S cor

Proof. See [13, Lemma A.2.19].

Remark 3.8. This raises the question about to what extent a converse of Lemma 3.7 holds true.
In the literature a six-functor-formalism is often introduced merely as a collection of functors such
that the isomorphisms of Lemma 3.7 exist, without specifying explicitly their compatibilities. In
view of the theory developed in this section the question becomes: how can the 1- and 2-morphisms
in the 2-multicategory S cor be presented by generators and relations? We will not try to answer
this question because all compatibilities, if needed, can be easily derived from the deﬁnition of S cor.
As an illustration, we prove that the diagram of isomorphisms

G!((F ∗A) ⊗ F ∗g∗B)

(∗,∗)

commutes. For this we only have to check that the two chains of obvious 2-isomorphisms in S cor
given in Figure 1 and Figure 2 are equal. To see this, observe that the multicorrespondences in
the lines are all 2-isomorphic to the multicorrespondence

and that all the 2-isomorphisms in the chains (which induce the isomorphisms in Lemma 3.7 used
in the diagram in question) respect these 2-isomorphisms.
See 9.4 for a similar calculation involving also an (iso-)morphism f! → f∗, i.e. involving a proper
six-functor-formalism.
3.9. Canonical Grothendieck contexts: Let S be an ordinary 1-category with ﬁber products and
ﬁnal object. S op can be turned into a multicategory in the way described in 2.19. Let p ∶ D → S op
be an ordinary biﬁbration of 1-multicategories. Let S0 be a subcategory of “proper” morphisms
for which projection formula and base change formula hold true. Assume that S0 is stable under
base-change.

n, β′, ρ′)is a morphism γ ∶ U → U ′ in S

Proposition 3.11. Deﬁnition 3.10 is reasonable, i.e. the composition induced by projection and
base change formula is associative.

The composition can only be deﬁned if also the 1-morphisms are restricted to the 2-multicategory
S cor,proper,0 of those multicorrespondences where β ∈ S0. The category ̃Dproper is obviously 2-ﬁbered
over S cor,proper,0, the 2-pull-back given by ρ′ ↦ γ∗ρ′.
In many cases it is possible to extend the so constructed partial six-functor-formalism to a 1-
opﬁbration (which is still 2-ﬁbered with 1-categorical ﬁbers) over the whole S cor,0:

̃Dproper

̃D

S cor,proper,0 

/ S cor,0

That is, if right adjoints exist, even to a Grothendieck six-functor-formalism. The right hand
side 1-ﬁbration encodes also morphisms f! → f∗ for the corresponding operations and all their
compatibilities (cf. 9.3). Its construction will be explained more generally in the derivator context
in a forthcoming article and parallels the classical construction using compactiﬁcations.

4 Correspondences of diagrams

Let Dia be a diagram category [13, §1.1], i.e. a full 2-subcategory of the 2-category of small categories
satisfying some basic closure properties. Assume that strictly associative ﬁber products have been
chosen in Dia. In this section we will deﬁne a category Diacor of correspondences in Dia similar to
the category of correspondences in a usual category considered in the last section. A Wirthm¨uller
context over Diacor in the way deﬁned in the last section will be equivalent to a closed monoidal
derivator with domain Dia (without the axioms (Der1) and (Der2)). Also the more general notion
of ﬁbered multiderivator developed in [13] can be easily encoded. Since Dia is a 2-category the
deﬁnition of Diacor is a bit more involved.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let Cor(I1, . . . , In; J) be the following strict 2-category:

1. The objects are diagrams of diagrams and functors of the form

3. The 2-morphisms are natural transformations η ∶ γ ⇒ γ′ such that (α′

i ∗ η) ○ νi = ν′

i and

(β′ ∗ η) ○ µ′ = µ.

We deﬁne also the full subcategory CorF (I1, . . . , In; J) of those objects for which α1 ×⋯× αn ∶ A →
I1×⋯× In is a Grothendieck ﬁbration and β is an opﬁbration. The γ’s do not need to be morphisms
of ﬁbrations, resp. coﬁbrations.
Deﬁnition 4.2. We deﬁne the category of correspondences (or spans) of diagrams Diacor
as the following 2-multicategory:

1. The objects are diagrams I ∈ Dia,
2. The 1-morphisms Hom(I1, . . . , In; J) are objects of CorF(I1, . . . , In; J) and the composition is

given by the ﬁber product.

3. The 2-morphisms (A, α1, . . . , αn, β) ⇒ (A′, α′

1, . . . , α′

π0(HomCor((A, α1, . . . , αn, β),(A′, α′

n, β′) are elements of
n, β′))).

1, . . . , α′

Actually Diacor is in a natural way a 3-category in which we have replaced the categories of
2-morphisms by their set of connected components π0. We could also have used the full cate-
gory Cor(I1, . . . , In; J) but then the composition would have been more complicated (involving the
comma category) leading to a bicategory only which, however, would be equivalent to the present
strict one.
To see that the deﬁnition of composition makes sense here, consider the following diagram:

A ×Ji B

One checks that A ×Ji B → J1 × ⋯ × I1 × ⋯ × In × ⋯ × Jm is again a Grothendieck opﬁbration and
that A ×Ji B → K is again a Grothendieck ﬁbration.
It remains to be seen that the composition is functorial in 2-morphisms and that the relations in
π0 are respected. This is obviously the case if we have a functor γA ∶ A → A′ such that β′
AγA = β′
A
and a functor γB ∶ B → B′ such that αB,1γB = α′
B,1. Hence the statement follows from the following
lemma.

Lemma 4.3. Any 2-morphism

(γ, ν1, . . . , νn, µ) ∶ (A, α1, . . . , αn, β) → (A′, α′

1, . . . , α′

n, β′)

is equivalent (in the sense of π0) to a 2-morphism in which all νk are identities or to one where µ
is an identity.
Proof. For each a ∈ A, µ induces a morphism β′γ(a) → β(a). Since β′ is an opﬁbration, we have
a coCartesian morphism ξa ∶ γ(a) → a′ in A′ mapping via β′ to β′γ(a) → β(a). By the universal
property of coCartesian arrows, we see that the association γ′ ∶ a → a′ is actually functorial and the
coCartesian morphisms assemble to a natural transformation ξ ∶ γ → γ′ By construction β′γ′ = β
n ∗ ξn)νn, id is an equivalent morphism where µ is an identity. Similarly
1 ∗ ξ)ν1, . . . ,(α′
and so γ′,(α′
the other statement is shown.

To prove that relations in π0 are respected, we can now concentrate on relations between morphisms,
where all νi are identities, resp. µ is an identity. These deﬁne obviously a relation for morphisms
between the ﬁber products.
4.4. Recall the procedure from [5, §1.3.1] to associate with a pseudo-functor F ∶ I op × J → Dia, a
category

∫ ∇F = ∇∫ F

α

yrrrrrrrrrrr

I

β

%▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲▲

J

such that α is a Grothendieck ﬁbration and β is an opﬁbration. This is done by applying the
Grothendieck construction, and its dual, respectively, to the two variables separately. Explicitly,
the category ∫ ∇F has the objects (i, j, X ∈ F(i, j)) and morphisms (i, j, X ∈ F(i, j)) → (i′, j′, X′ ∈
F(i′, j′)) are triples consisting of morphisms a ∶ i → i′ and b ∶ j → j′ and a morphism F(idi, b)X →
F(a, idj)X′. The pseudo-functors F ∶ I op × J → Dia form a 2-category Hom(I op × J, Dia) consisting
of pseudo-functors, pseudo-natural transformations and modiﬁcations.

Proposition 4.5. There is a pair of pseudo-functors

Fun(I op

1 ×⋯ × I op

n × J, Dia)

Ξ

Π

/ Cor(I1, . . . , In; J)

such that we have morphisms in the 2-category of endofunctors of Cor(I1, . . . , In; J)

which are inverse to each other up to chains of 2-morphisms, and such that we have morphisms in

which are inverse to each other up to chains of 2-morphisms.

Proof. The pseudo-functor Ξ is deﬁned as follows: A pseudo-functor F ∈ Fun(I op
is sent to the category ∫ ∇F , deﬁned above, which comes equipped with a ﬁbration to I1 ×⋅⋅⋅ × In

1 ×⋯× I op

and an opﬁbration to J. The fact that these are a ﬁbration, and an opﬁbration, respectively, does

not play any role for this proposition, however. A natural transformation µ ∶ F → G is sent to the
obvious functor ̃µ ∶ ∫ ∇F → ∫ ∇G. A modiﬁcation µ ⇒ µ′ induces a natural transformation ̃µ ⇒ ̃ν
which whiskered with any of the projections to the Ik or to J gives an identity.
Π is deﬁned as follows: A correspondence (A, α1, . . . , αn, β) is sent to the following functor:

1 × ⋯ × I op
I op

n × J → Dia

(i1, . . . , in, j) ↦ {(i1, . . . , in)} ×~(I1×⋅⋅⋅×In) A ×~J {j}

A 1-morphism given by γ ∶ A → A′ and ν1, . . . , νn, µ, respectively, induces functors

̃γ(i1, . . . , in; j) ∶ {(i1, . . . , in)} ×~(I1×⋅⋅⋅×In) A ×~J {j} → {(i1, . . . , in)} ×~(I1×⋅⋅⋅×In) A′ ×~J {j}

which assemble to a pseudo-natural transformation and a 2-morphism µ ∶ γ ⇒ γ′ induces a natural
transformation between the corresponding functors ̃γ(i1, . . . , in; j) ⇒ ̃γ(i1, . . . , in; j) which assemble
to a modiﬁcation.
We now proceed to construct the required 1-morphisms: Π ○ Ξ maps a functor F to the functor

F ∶ (i1, . . . , in, j) ↦ {(i1, . . . , in)} ×~(I1×⋅⋅⋅×In) (S ∇F) ×~J {j}.

Point-wise the required natural transformation id → Π ○ Ξ is given by sending an object X
of F(i1, . . . , in; j) to the object (i1, . . . , in, j, X) of (∫ ∇F) together with the various identities
idi1 , . . . , idin , idj. Point-wise the required natural transformation Π ○ Ξ → id is given by sending
k and β ∶ j′ → j to
an object (i′
F(α1, . . . , αn; β)X ∈ F(i1, . . . , in; j). One easily checks that these even constitute an adjunction in
the 2-category of endofunctors of Fun(I op
The pseudo-functor Ξ ○ Π is given by

(A, α1, . . . , αn, β) ↦ (I1 × ⋯ × In ×~(I1×⋯×In) A ×~J J; prI1, . . . , prIn, prJ)

together with the various projections. First we will construct an adjunction of Ξ ○ Π with the
pseudo-functor

(A, α1, . . . , αn, β) ↦ (I1 ×⋯ × In ×~(I1×⋯×In) A; prI1, . . . , prIn, β).

In one direction we have the functor which complements an object (a, . . . ) by the identity idβ(a).
In the other direction we have the forgetful functor, forgetting β(a) → j. Those two functors form
an adjunction in the 2-category of endofunctors of Cor(I1, . . . , In; J).
Similarly we have an adjunction between

(A, α1, . . . , αn, β) ↦ (I1 × ⋯ × In ×~(I1×⋯×In) A; prI1 , . . . , prIn , β)

and the identity

(A, α1, . . . , αn, β) ↦ (A, α1, . . . , αn, β).

Observe that the functor Ξ actually has values in the full subcategory CorF(I1, . . . , In; J). Denote
by τ1(E) for a 2-category E the 1-category having the same objects and where the morphism sets
are the π0 of the previous morphisms categories.

29

Corollary 4.6. We have equivalences of categories:

τ1(Fun(I op

1 × ⋯ × I op

n × J, Dia)) ≅ τ1(Cor(I1, . . . , In; J)) ≅ τ1(CorF (I1, . . . , In; J)),

1 × ⋯ × I op

1 × ⋯ × J op

where τ1(C) for a is a 2-category C denotes the 1-category where the morphism sets are the π0 of
the respective category of 1-morphisms in C.
Hence we could have deﬁned the 2-category Diacor (as a bicategory) using any of these three
models for the homomorphism categories. However, only using CorF(I1, . . . , In; J) we get strict
associativity and the existence of identities. Let us see how, up to isomorphism, composition
n × Ji → CAT and let
would look like using τ1(Fun(I op
m × K → CAT be two functors. Then the deﬁnition G ○i F ∶= hocoendJiG × F (cf.
G ∶ J op
Deﬁnition 4.7) is compatible with the equivalences of the corollary.
Deﬁnition 4.7. Let J be a diagram and let F ∶ J op × J → Dia be a pseudo-functor. We deﬁne
the diagram hocoendJ F as the category whose objects are pairs (j, x) with j ∈ J and x ∈ F(j, j)
and whose morphisms (α, γ);(j, x) → (j′, x′) are pairs consisting of a morphisms α ∶ j → j′ and a
morphism γ ∶ F(idj, α)x → F(α, idj′)x′. The composition of two morphisms (α, γ);(j, x) → (j′, x′)
and (α′, γ′);(j′, x′) → (j′′, x′′) is deﬁned by (α′, γ′) ○ (α, γ) = (α′α,(F(α, idj′′)γ′) ○ (F(idj, α′)γ)).
Proposition 4.8. There is a pseudo-functor of 2-multicategories

n × J, Dia)). Let F ∶ I op

1 × ⋯ × I op

where Dia2−op is considered a 2-multicategory by setting

Dia2−op → Diacor

HomDia2−op(I1, . . . , In; J) ∶= Hom(I1 ×⋯ × In, J)op.

There is a pseudo-functor of 2-multicategories

where Dia1−op is considered a 2-multicategory by setting

Dia1−op → Diacor

HomDia1−op(I1, . . . , In; J) ∶= Hom(J, I1) × ⋯ × Hom(J, In).

In particular for any I ∈ Dia there is a natural pseudofunctor of 2-multicategories

{⋅} → Diacor

with value I.

Proof. The functor

is the identity on objects. A 1-morphism α ∈ Hom(I1 ×⋯× In, J) is mapped to the correspondence

by µ. Note that the projections from I1 ×⋯ × In ×~J J to I1 ×⋯ × In and to J, respectively, are an
opﬁbration, and a ﬁbration, respectively.
To establish the pseudo-functoriality, we have to show that there is a natural isomorphism of
correspondences between

(I1 × ⋯ × In) ×~Ji Ji ×Ji (J1 × ⋯ × Jn) ×~K K

between the two categories which establishes this isomorphism.

in τ1(CorF (J1, . . . , Ji−1, I1, . . . , In, Ji+1, . . . , Jn; K)). One checks that there is even an adjunction
between the two categories which establishes this isomorphism.
The requested pseudo-functor

{⋅} → Dia2−op

with value I is given by the composition of the obvious pseudo-functor {⋅} → Dia1−op, sending the
unique multimorphism in Hom(⋅, . . . ,⋅ ;⋅) to {idI}i=1..n, with the previous pseudo-functor Dia1−op →
Diacor.

Proposition 4.9. The 2-multicategory Diacor is (strictly symmetric) 1-biﬁbered and (trivially) 2-
biﬁbered over {⋅} hence it is a (strictly symmetric) monoidal 2-category with monoidal structure
represented by

I ⊗ J = I × J

with unit given by the trivial diagram. In particular every object is dualizable w.r.t. the trivial dia-
gram and the duality functor is just I ↦ I op on objects and on 1-morphisms given by the composition
of equivalences:

Hom(J op, I op) ≅ τ1(Fun(J × I op, Dia)) = τ1(Fun(I op × J, Dia)) ≅ Hom(I, J).

Proof. By Corollary 4.6 we have equivalences

and also

τ1(Cor(I1, I2; J)) ≅ τ1(Fun(I op

1 × I op

2 × J, Dia))

τ1(Cor(I1 × I2; J)) ≅ τ1(Fun(I op

1 × I op

2 × J, Dia)).

Obviously the composition of the equivalences (2) with the inverse of (3) is isomorphic to the

is 1-ﬁbered and 2-biﬁbered.

2. The 1-categorical truncation

τ1(CorD((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y ))) → τ1(Cor(I1, . . . , In; J))

is still ﬁbered.

Proof. By construction the given 2-functor is 1-ﬁbered (the pull-back is given by ρ ↦ γ∗ρ). The
functor even induces an isomorphism of the sets of 2-morphisms. The 2-biﬁberedness therefore
boils down to the assertion that the commutativity of (5) does only depend on the class of the
morphism (γ, ν1, . . . , νn, µ) in π0(Hom(I1, . . . , In; J)). This follows from the 2-functoriality of the
pre-multiderivator. Then also 2. follows.

5.3. Similarly to Corollary 4.6 we have an equivalence of ﬁbrations (in particular the top horizontal
functor is a morphism of ﬁbrations)

τ1(CorF

D((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y )))

τ1(CorF (I1, . . . , In; J)) 

/ τ1(Cor(I1, . . . , In; J))

We need to understand this equivalence more explicitly:

Deﬁnition 5.4. We deﬁne a 2-multicategory Diacor(D) with a functor (with 1-categorical ﬁbers)

as follows:

Diacor(D) → Diacor

1. The objects of Diacor(D) are pairs (I, X) with I ∈ Dia and X ∈ D(I).
2. The category HomDiacor(D)((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y )) of 1-morphisms of Diacor(D) is de-
D((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y ))). Composition is

ﬁned to be the truncated category τ1(CorF

Remark 5.5. By the very deﬁnition Diacor(D) → Diacor has 1-categorical ﬁbers and, by Lemma 5.2,
it is 2-ﬁbered over Diacor. Later (cf. 7.2) we will generalize this deﬁnition to 2-pre-multiderivators.

5.6. Let S be a pre-multiderivator. Recall the deﬁnition of Dia(S) from [13, §1.6]:

1. The objects of Dia(S) are pairs (I, S) where I ∈ Dia and S ∈ S(S).
2. The 1-Morphisms in Hom((I, S);(J, T)) of Dia(S) are pairs (α, f), where α ∶ I → J is a

functor in Dia together with a morphism

f ∶ S → α∗T.

Main theorem 5.8. Let D and S be pre-multiderivators satisfying (Dia1) and (Dia2) (cf. [13,
Deﬁnition 1.3.5.]). A strict morphism of pre-multiderivators D → S is a left (resp. right) ﬁbered
multiderivator if and only if Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is a 1-opﬁbration (resp. 1-ﬁbration) of 2-
multicategories.

Proof. We ﬁrst show that Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is a 1-opﬁbration, if D → S is a left ﬁbered
multiderivator. Let x = (A; αA,1, . . . , αA,n; βA) be a correspondence in CorF(I1, . . . , In; J) and let

f ∈ Hom(α∗
be a 1-morphism in Diacor(S) lying over x.
isomorphisms of sets:

1 S1, . . . , α∗

nSn; β∗T)

In Diacor(D) we have the following composition of

HomDiacor(D),f((I1,E1), . . . ,(In,En);(J,F))

nEn; β∗F)

1E1, . . . , α∗

≅ HomD(A),f(α∗
1E1, . . . , α∗
≅ HomD(A),idβ∗T (f●(α∗
1E1, . . . , α∗
≅ HomD(A),idT (β!f●(α∗
≅ HomDiacor(D),id(J,T)((J, β!f●(α∗

nEn); β∗F)
nEn);F)
1E1, . . . , α∗

nEn));(J,F))

using (FDer0 left) and (FDer3 left). One checks that this composition is induced by the composition
in Diacor(D) with a morphism

Homf((I1,E1), . . . ,(In,En);(J, β!f●(α∗

1E1, . . . , α∗

nEn))).

Hence this 1-morphism is weakly coCartesian.
Note that we write HomDiacor(D),f for the category of 1-morphisms which map to f in Diacor(S)
and those 2-morphisms that map to idf in Diacor(S).
It remains to be shown that the composition of weakly coCartesian 1-morphisms is weakly coCarte-
sian (cf. 2.6). Let

g ∈ Hom(α∗

B,1T1, . . . , α∗

B,mTm; β∗

be another coCartesian 1-morphism, composable with f , lying over a correspondence y = (B; αB,1, . . . , αB,m; βB)
in CorF (J1, . . . , Jm; K). Setting Ji ∶= J and Ti ∶= T the composition of x and y w.r.t. the i-th slot
is the correspondence:

Now we proceed to prove the converse, hence we assume that Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is a 1-
opﬁbration and have to show all axioms of a left ﬁbered derivator:
(Der0 left/right)
First we have a pseudo-functor of 2-multicategories, namely the composition

F ∶ S(I) ↪ Diaop(S)1−op → Diacor(S)

where the ﬁrst functor is the obvious inclusion and the second was constructed in 5.7. By Proposi-
tion 2.23 the pull-back F ∗ Diacor(D) → S(I) is (op-)ﬁbered if Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is (op-)ﬁbered.
To show that D(I) → S(I) is an opﬁbration of multicategories, it suﬃces therefore to show that
the pull-back in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.22 of Diacor(D) along this pseudo-functor is equivalent
to D(I) over S(I). The class of objects of F ∗ Diacor(D) is by deﬁnition isomorphic to the class of
objects of D(I). Therefore we are left to show that there are equivalences of categories (compatible
with composition)

HomD(I),f(E1, . . . ,En;F) → HomF ∗ Diacor(D),f(E1, . . . ,En;F)

where Ei is an object of D(I) over Si and F is an object over T and f ∈ HomS(I)(S1, . . . , Sn; T).
Note that the left-hand side is a discrete category. We have a 2-Cartesian diagram of categories

HomF ∗ Diacor(D),f(E1, . . . ,En;F)

HomDiacor(D)((I,E1), . . . ,(I,En);(I,F))

Since the right vertical morphism is a ﬁbration (cf. 5.5) the diagram is also Cartesian. Futhermore
by Corollary 4.6 the right vertical morphism is equivalent to

τ1(CorD((I,E1), . . . ,(I,En);(I,F)))

τ1(CorS((I, S1), . . . ,(I, Sn);(I, T)))

D(. . . ) (resp. CorF

S (. . . )) was changed to CorD(. . . ) (resp. CorS(. . . )).) In the category
(Here CorF
τ1(Cor[S]((I1, S1), . . . ,(In, Sn);(J, T))), the object F(f) is isomorphic to f over the trivial cor-
respondence (idI , . . . , idI ; idI) whose ﬁber in τ1(Cor[D]((I,E1), . . . ,(I,En);(I,F))) is precisely the
discrete category HomD(I),f(E1, . . . ,En;F). The remaining part of (FDer0 left) will be shown later.
(FDer3 left) Let α ∶ I → J be a functor in Dia and S ∈ S(J) be an object.
First consider the following commutative diagram of categories where the horizontal morphisms
are equivalences

HomDiacor(D)((I,E);(J,F))

τ1(Cor[D]((I,E);(J,F)))

HomDiacor(S)((I, α∗S);(J, S))

τ1(Cor[S]((I, α∗S);(J, S)))

τ1(CorF(I; J))

∼

/ τ1(Cor(I; J))

where E is any object in D(I)α∗S and F is in D(J)S. Note that the vertical functors are Grothendieck
opﬁbrations with discrete ﬁbers. In τ1(CorF (I; J)) we have the canonical correspondence induced
by α

and over it in τ1(Cor[S]((I, α∗S);(J, S))) the canonical span ̃α′ given by the identity idα∗S. The

HomD(I),idα∗S(E, α∗F).

induced by the natural transformation µ ∶ pr1 α ⇒ pr2. Since Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is a 1-
opﬁbration, we have a coCartesian arrow

ξ ∈ HomDiacor(D),̃α((I,E),(J, ̃α●E))

such that

HomDiacor(D),̃α((I,E),(J,F)) ≅ HomDiacor(D),id(J,S)((J, ̃α●E),(J,F))

via composition by ξ. Now we have by deﬁnition of Diacor(D):

HomDiacor(D),id(J,S)((J, ̃α●E),(J,F)) ≅ HomD(J)S(̃α●E,F).

On the other hand:

HomDiacor(D),̃α((I,E),(J,F)) = τ1(Cor[D]((I,E);(J,F))̃α′) = HomD(I)α∗S(E, α∗F).

Therefore

! E ∶= ̃α●E
α(S)
deﬁnes a left adjoint functor to α∗ ∶ D(J)S → D(I)α∗S.
We have now push-forwards in the ﬁbered category D(I) → S(I) and left adjoints of the functors
α∗ ∶ D(J)S → D(I)α∗S. Between those and arbitrary 1-coCartesian arrows the following relation
holds because of the discussion in 5.3:

If we can show that there is a natural isomorphism

This is shown similarly using an appropriate composition of correspondences.

Remark 5.9. Given a ﬁbration (resp. opﬁbration) of 2-multicategories D → Diacor we can also
reconstruct a (non-strict) pre-multiderivator D. This will be brieﬂy explained in 9.8. We will
however not use this fact, but assume that our (op)ﬁbered 2-multicategories Diacor(D) → Diacor
come from a strict pre-multiderivator.

Remark 5.10. In view of the main theorem the basic results of [13, §1] appear in a much clearer
fashion. For example from the transitivity for biﬁbered 2-multicategories (Lemma 2.24) follows
immediately the transitivity for ﬁbered multiderivators [13, Proposition 1.4.1.].

2-pre-Multiderivators

6
Deﬁnition 6.1. A 2-pre-multiderivator is a functor S ∶ Dia1−op → 2-MCAT which is strict
in 1-morphisms (functors) and pseudo-functorial in 2-morphisms (natural transformations). More
precisely: It associates with any diagram I a 2-multicategory S(I), with any functor α ∶ I → J a
strict functor

α∗ ∶= S(α) ∶ S(J) → S(I)

and with a natural transformation µ ∶ α ⇒ α′ a pseudo-natural transformation

S(η) ∶ α∗ ⇒ (α′)∗

such that the following holds:

1. Strict functoriality w.r.t. compositons of 1-morphisms:

i.e. for functors α ∶ I → J and β ∶
J → K, we have α∗β∗ = (βα)∗ and β∗(S(η)(X)) = S(β ∗ η)(X) as well as S(η)(α∗X) =
S(η ∗ α)(X).

2. The association

Fun(I, J) → Fun(S(J), S(I))

given by α ↦ α∗, resp. µ ↦ S(µ) is a pseudo-functor. Here Fun(S(J), S(I)) is the 2-category
of strict 2-functors, pseudo-natural transformations, and modiﬁcations.

44

(
t
A symmetric, resp. braided 2-pre-multiderivator is given by the structure of strictly symmet-
ric (resp. braided) 2-multicategory on S(I) such that the strict functors α∗ are equivariant w.r.t.
the action of the symmetric groups (resp. braid groups).
Similarly we deﬁne a lax, resp. oplax 2-pre-multiderivator where the same as before holds but
where the

S(η) ∶ α∗ ⇒ (α′)∗

are lax (resp. oplax) natural transformations and in 2. “pseudo-natural transformations” is replaced
by “lax (resp. oplax) natural transformations”.
Deﬁnition 6.2. A strict morphism p ∶ D → S of 2-pre-multiderivators (resp. lax 2-pre-multiderivators,
resp. oplax 2-pre-multiderivators) is given by a strict 2-functor

such that the following diagram commutes for all functors α ∶ I → J, α′
transformations µ ∶ α ⇒ α′.

6.3. As with usual pre-derivators we consider the following axioms:
(Der1) For I, J in Dia, the natural functor D(I ∐ J) → D(I)×D(J) is an equivalence of 2-multicategories.

Moreover D(∅) is not empty.

(Der2) For I in Dia the ‘underlying diagram’ functor

dia ∶ D(I) → Fun(I, D(⋅))

resp. Funlax(I, D(⋅))

resp. Funoplax(I, D(⋅))

is 2-conservative (i.e. it is conservative on 2-morphisms and for a 1-morphism the following
holds: if dia(α) is an equivalence then α is an equivalence).

Let D be a 2-multicategory. We deﬁne some (lax/oplax) 2-pre-multiderivators which are

6.4.
called representable 2-pre-multiderivators.
We deﬁne a 2-pre-multiderivator associated with D as

D ∶ Dia → 2-MCAT
I ↦ Fun(I,D)

where Fun(I,D) is the 2-multicategory of pseudo-functors, pseudo-natural transformations, and
modiﬁcations. This is usually considered only if all 2-morphisms in D are invertible.
We deﬁne a lax 2-pre-multiderivator as

Dlax ∶ Dia → 2-MCAT

I ↦ Funlax(I,D)

We deﬁne an oplax 2-pre-multiderivator as

Doplax ∶ Dia → 2-MCAT

I ↦ Funoplax(I,D)

where Funoplax(I,D) is the 2-multicategory of pseudo-functors, oplax natural transformations, and
modiﬁcations.

Proposition 6.5.

1. If D → S is a 1-ﬁbration (resp. 1-opﬁbration, resp. 2-ﬁbration, resp. 2-
opﬁbration) of 2-categories then D(I) → S(I) is a 1-ﬁbration (resp. 1-opﬁbration, resp. 2-
ﬁbration, resp. 2-opﬁbration) of 2-categories.

2. If D → S is a 1-ﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration of 2-categories then Dlax(I) → Slax(I) is a 1-
If D → S is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration of

ﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration of 2-categories.
2-multicategories then Dlax(I) → Slax(I) is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration of 2-categories.
If D → S is a 1-ﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration of 2-categories then Doplax(I) → Soplax(I) is a
1-ﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration of 2-categories. If D → S is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration of 2-
multicategories then Doplax(I) → Soplax(I) is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration of 2-categories.
3. If D → S is a 1-biﬁbration and 2-isoﬁbration of 2-multicategories with complete 1-categorical

ﬁbers then D(I) → S(I) is a 1-biﬁbration and 2-isoﬁbration of 2-multicategories.

Proof (sketch): We show exemplarily 1. for 1-ﬁbrations of 2-categories and 2. for 1-ﬁbrations of
2-categories. The same proof works for 1-opﬁbrations (even of 2-multicategories).
If we have a
1-biﬁbration of 2-multicategories with 1-categorical ﬁbers then a slight extension of the proof of
[13, Proposition 4.1.6.] shows 3. For 1-opﬁbrations and 2-ﬁbrations of 2-multi-categories with 1-
categorical ﬁbers this is actually easier to prove using the encoding by a pseudo-functor as follows:
The 1-opﬁbration D → S with 1-categorical ﬁbers is encoded in a pseudo-functor

S → MCAT

The category D(I) → S(I) is encoded in the pseudo-functor

S(I) → MCAT

which maps a pseudo-functor F ∶ I → S to the multicategory of natural transformations and
modiﬁcations

HomFun(I,MCAT )(⋅, F),

where ⋅ is the constant functor with value the 1-point category.
This construction may be adapted to 2-categorical ﬁbers by using “pseudo-functors” of 3-categories.
The problem with 1-ﬁbrations of (1- or 2-)multi categories comes from the fact that the internal
Hom cannot be computed point-wise but involves a limit construction (cf. [13, Proposition 4.1.6.]).
The diﬀerence between external and internal monoidal product in Diacor(D) gives a theoretical
explanation of this phenomenon (cf. 8.4).

46

1-ﬁbration of 2-categories D → S implies 1-ﬁbration of 2-categories D(I) → S(I):
Let I be a diagram in Dia. Let Y, Z ∶ I → S be pseudo-functors, f ∶ Y ⇒ Z be a pseudo-natural
transformation and E ∶ I → D be a pseudo-functor over Z. For each morphism α ∶ i → i′ we are
given a 2-commutative diagram

Y (i) f(i)

Z(i)

Y (α)

⇗fα

Z(α)

Y (i′) f(i′)

/ Z(i′)

Since f is assumed to be a pseudo-functor, the morphism fα is invertible. We will construct a
pseudo-functor G ∶ I → D over Y and a 1-coCartesian morphism ξ ∶ G → E over f . For each i, we
choose a 1-coCartesian morphism

over f(i) ∶ Y (i) → Z(i). For each α, we look at the 2-Cartesian diagram

ξ(i) ∶ G(i) → E(i)

HomD(G(i),G(i′)) ξ(i′)○

HomD(G(i),E(i′))

HomS(Y (i), Y (i′)) f(i′)○

/ HomS(Y (i), Z(i′))

The triple (Eα ○ ξ(i), fα, Yα) is an object in the category

HomD(G(i),E(i′)) ×∼

~ HomS(Y (i),Z(i′)) HomS(Y (i), Y (i′))

Deﬁne G(α) to be an object in HomD(G(i),G(i′)) such that there exists a 2-isomorphism

Ξα ∶ (ξ(i′) ○ Gα, id, p(Gα)) ⇒ (Eα ○ ξ(i), f −1

α , Yα).

Such an object exists because the above square is 2-Cartesian.
We get a 2-commutative square

G(i) ξ(i)

E(i)

G(i′) ξ(i′)

Here ξα is the ﬁrst component of Ξα.
This deﬁnes a pseudo-functor G ∶ I → D as follows. Let α ∶ i → i′ and β ∶ i′ → i′′ be two morphisms
in I. We need to deﬁne a 2-isomorphism Gβα ⇒ Gβ ○ Gα. It suﬃces to deﬁne the 2-isomorphism
after applying the embedding

HomD(G(i),G(i′′)) ↪ HomD(G(i),E(i′′)) ×∼

~ HomS (Y (i),Z(i′′)) HomS(Y (i), Y (i′′))

which maps Gβ ○ Gα to

and Gβα to

(ξ(i′′) ○ Gβ ○ Gα, id, p(Gβ) ○ p(Gα))

(ξ(i′′) ○ Gβα, id, p(Gβα)).

hence a valid isomorphism in HomD(G(i),E(i′′))×∼
~ HomS (Y (i),Z(i′′)) HomS(Y (i), Y (i′′)). One checks
that this satisﬁes the axioms of a pseudo-functor (Deﬁnition 1.2) and that ξ is indeed a pseudo-
natural transformation (Deﬁnition 1.3).
Now assume that we have a lax natural transfomation, i.e. the fα go into the opposite direction
and are no longer invertible. We assume that we have a 2-ﬁbration as well. Then the diagram

HomD(G(i),G(i′)) ξ(i′)○

HomD(G(i),E(i′))

HomS(Y (i), Y (i′)) f(i′)○

is Cartesian as well. Moreover we have an adjunction with the full comma category

with ρ ○ can = id, in particular with the morphism ‘can’ fully faithful. See below for the precise
deﬁnition of ρ. Hence we deﬁne

G(α) ∶= ρξ(i′),G(i)(Eα ○ ξ(i), fα, Yα)

and get at least a morphism (coming from the unit of the adjunction):

Ξα ∶ (ξ(i′) ○ G(α), id, p(G(α))) ⇒ (Eα ○ ξ(i), fα, Yα).

The ﬁrst component of Ξα this time (potentially) deﬁne a lax-natural transformation ξ ∶ G → E
only. To turn G into a pseudo-functor, we have to see that ρ is functorial.
For a Cartesian arrow ξ ∶ E → F, we deﬁne

ρξ,G ∶ HomD(G,F) ×~ HomS (U,T ) HomS(U, S) → HomD(G,E)
as follows: Let (τ, µ, g) be a tuple with g ∈ HomS(U, S), τ ∈ HomD(G,F) and

µ ∶ f ○ g ⇒ p(τ)

a 2-morphism. We may choose a coCartesian 2-morphism

̃µ ∶ X ⇒ τ

above µ. We set ρξ(τ, µ, g) equal to an object with an isomorphism

(ξ ○ ρξ(τ, µ, g), id, p(ρξ(τ, µ, g))) ∼Ð→ (X, id, g).

Together with the morphism

̃µ ∶ (X, id, g) Ð→ (τ, µ, g)

we get the counit

can ○ ρξ ⇒ id .
We need to deﬁne a 2-isomorphism Gβα ⇒ Gβ ○ Gα. i.e.

ρξ(i′′),G(i)(Eβα ○ ξ(i), fβα, Yβα) →

ρξ(i′′),G(i′)(Eβ ○ ξ(i′), fβ, Yβ) ○ ρξ(i′),G(i)(Eα ○ ξ(i), fα, Yα)

First of all, we get three Cartesian 2-morphisms

fβα ∶ Xβα ⇒ Eβα ○ ξ(i)
̃fα ∶ Xα ⇒ Eα ○ ξ(i)
̃fβ ∶ Xβ ⇒ Eβ ○ ξ(i′)
and have to deﬁne an isomorphism (after applying can)

over fβα
over fα
over fβ

(Xβα, id, Y (βα)) ∼Ð→ (Xβ, id, Y (β)) ○ (Xα, id, Y (α)).

The pasting in the second diagram is just fβ,α by deﬁnition of lax natural transformation for f .
This yields an isomorphism between the pastings in diagram (6) and (7) over Yβ,α which we deﬁne
to be Gβ,α. One checks that this deﬁnes indeed a pseudo-functor G such that ξ ∶ G → E is a lax
natural transformation which is 1-Cartesian.
Lemma 6.6. Let D → S be a 2-(op)ﬁbration of 2-categories. Let µ ∶ α ⇒ β be a 2-(co)Cartesian
morphism, where α, β ∶ E → F are 1-morphisms.
If γ ∶ F → G is a 1-morphism then γ ∗ µ is
2-(co)Cartesian. Similarly, if γ′ ∶ G → E is a 1-morphism then µ ∗ γ′ is 2-(co)Cartesian.
Proof. This follows immediately from the axiom that composition is a morphism of (op-)ﬁbrations.

7 Fibered multiderivators over 2-pre-multiderivators

We now extend the deﬁnition of Diacor(S) for a pre-multiderivator (Deﬁnition 5.4) to 2-pre-
multiderivators (resp. to lax/colax 2-pre-multiderivators). For this, we ﬁrst have to extend the
deﬁnition of Cor(I1, . . . , In; J) to diagrams in S.

also the the two ‘vertical’ 2-morphisms go in the same direction and the ‘horizontal’ ones are

ﬁbration and β is an opﬁbration.

By construction the strict 2-functor

CorS((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y )) → Cor(I1, . . . , In; J)

is 1-ﬁbered and 2-ﬁbered.
Note: Since the 2-morphism sets change, this does not imply anymore that the truncation

τ1(CorS((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y ))) → τ1(Cor(I1, . . . , In; J))

has any ﬁbration properties.

Deﬁnition 7.2. Let D be a 2-pre-multiderivator. We deﬁne a morphism of 2-multicategories

as follows

Diacor(D) → Diacor

1. The Objects of Diacor(D) are pairs (I, X) consisting of I ∈ Dia and X ∈ S(I).
2. The category HomDiacor(D)((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y )) of 1-morphisms of Diacor(D) is de-

ﬁned to be the truncated category τ1(CorF

D((I1, X1), . . . ,(In, Xn);(J, Y ))).

Note: because of the brute-force truncation this category is not 2-ﬁbered anymore over Diacor.

In view of the Main Theorem 5.8 it is reasonable to make the following deﬁnitions. However, these
deﬁnitions are not always the most general ones and are rather stated to ﬁx ideas.

Deﬁnition 7.3. Let S be a 2-pre-multiderivator where all 2-morphisms are invertible.
Let D → S be a strict morphism of 2-pre-multiderivators (Deﬁnition 6.2) such that D and S each
satisfy (Der1) and (Der2) (cf. 6.3) is called a left (resp. right) ﬁbered multiderivator if the
strict functor of 2-multicategories

Diacor(D) → Diacor(S)

of Deﬁnition 7.2 is a 1-opﬁbration (resp. 1-ﬁbration) and 2-isoﬁbration with 1-categorical ﬁbers.
Similarly we deﬁne symmetric and braided (left or right) ﬁbered multiderivators.
Deﬁnition 7.4. Let S be a lax 2-pre-multiderivator. Let D → S be a strict morphism of lax 2-pre-
multiderivators (Deﬁnition 6.2) such that D and S each satisfy (Der1) and (Der2) (cf. 6.3) is called
a lax left (resp. right) ﬁbered multiderivator if the strict functor of 2-multicategories

Diacor(D) → Diacor(S)

of Deﬁnition 7.2 is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration (resp. 1-ﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration) with 1-
categorical ﬁbers. Similarly we deﬁne symmetric and braided lax (left or right) ﬁbered multideriva-
tors.
Deﬁnition 7.5. Let S be an oplax 2-pre-multiderivator. Let D → S be a strict morphism of
oplax 2-pre-multiderivators (Deﬁnition 6.2) such that D and S each satisfy (Der1) and (Der2)
(cf. 6.3) is called an oplax left (resp. right) ﬁbered multiderivator if the strict functor of
2-multicategories

Diacor(D) → Diacor(S)

of Deﬁnition 7.2 is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration (resp. 1-ﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration) with 1-
categorical ﬁbers. Similarly we deﬁne symmetric and braided oplax (left or right) ﬁbered multi-
derivators.

We include the assumption on 1-categorical ﬁbers in this deﬁnition because otherwise the 1-
truncation involved in the deﬁnition of Diacor(S) is probably not the right thing to work with.
In particular our deﬁnition does not give any generalized deﬁnition of a 2-derivator (or monoidal
2-derivator) as 2-ﬁbered derivator over {⋅}.
Our main purpose for introducing the more general notion of ﬁbered multiderivator over 2-pre-
multiderivators (as opposed to usual pre-multiderivators) is that it provides the right framework
to think about any kind of derived six-functor-context:
Deﬁnition 7.6. Let S be a category with ﬁbre-products. Recall from Deﬁnition 3.1 the 2-multicategory
S cor (resp. S cor,0 with choice of classes of proper or etale morphisms). Denote its associated 2-pre-
multiderivator by Scor, resp. Scor,0,lax, resp. Scor,0,oplax (cf. 6.4).

1. We deﬁne a (symmetric) derivator six-functor-formalism as a left and right ﬁbered

(symmetric) multiderivator

D → Scor.

2. We deﬁne a (symmetric) proper derivator six-functor-formalism as before which has

an extension as oplax left ﬁbered (symmetric) multiderivator to

and an extension as lax right ﬁbered (symmetric) multiderivator to

D → Scor,0,oplax,

D → Scor,0,lax.

53

3. We deﬁne a (symmetric) etale derivator six-functor-formalism as before which has an

extension as lax left ﬁbered (symmetric) multiderivator to

and an extension as oplax right ﬁbered (symmetric) multiderivator to

D → Scor,0,oplax.

D → Scor,0,lax,

In particular and in view of Section 9, if S cor,0 is formed w.r.t. the choice of all morphisms, we
could call a proper derivator six-functor-formalism a derivator Grothendieck context and an
etale derivator six-functor-formalism a derivator Wirthm¨uller context.

7.7. As was said for a 2-pre-multiderivator S the functor
Diacor(S) → Diacor

has hardly ever any ﬁbration properties. Nevertheless the composition

Diacor(S) → {⋅}

is often 1-biﬁbered, i.e. there exists an absolute monoidal product on Diacor(S) extending the one
on Diacor. For example for the representable 2-pre-multiderivator Scor we have on Diacor(Scor) the
monoidal product

(I, F) ⊠ (J, G) = (I × J, F × G)

where F × G is the diagram of correspondences in S formed by applying × point-wise. Similarly we
have

HOM((I, F),(J, G)) = (I op × J, F op × G)

where in F op all correspondences are ﬂipped.
dualizable with duality explicitly given by

In particular any object (I, F) in Diacor(Scor) is

HOM((I, F),(⋅,⋅)) = (I op, F op).

Given a derivator six-functor-formalism D → Scor we get an external monoidal product even on
Diacor(D) which prolongs the one on diagrams of correspondences, and in many concrete situations
all objects will be dualizable.

For representable 2-multi-derivators we get the following:
Proposition 7.8. If D → S is a 1-biﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration of 2-multicategories with 1-categorical
and bicomplete ﬁbers then

1. Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is a 1-biﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration,
2. Diacor,lax(D) → Diacor,lax(S) is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration,
3. Diacor,oplax(D) → Diacor,oplax(S) is a 1-ﬁbration and 2-ﬁbration.

If D → S is a 1-biﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration of 2-multicategories with 1-categorical and bicomplete
ﬁbers then

1. Diacor(D) → Diacor(S) is a 1-biﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration,
2. Diacor,lax(D) → Diacor,lax(S) is a 1-ﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration,
3. Diacor,oplax(D) → Diacor,oplax(S) is a 1-opﬁbration and 2-opﬁbration.

Proof. This follows from Proposition 7.8 doing the same constructions as in [13, Proposition 4.1.26.].

Internal and external monoidal structure.

Let D,S be symmetric (for simplicity) 2-multicategories with all 2-morphisms invertible.
8.1.
Let D → S be a symmetric 1-biﬁbered and 2-isoﬁbered 2-multicategory such that also S → {⋅} is
1-biﬁbered. Then any functor s ∶ {⋅} → S with value S gives rise to a symmetric closed monoidal
structure ⊗ on the 2-category DS. Moreover D → {⋅} is also ﬁbered by transitivity (cf. Proposi-
tion 2.24). Therefore the whole 2-category D carries a closed monoidal structure ⊠ as well. We
call ⊗ the internal product and ⊠ the external product and write Hom for the adjoint of the
former and HOM for the adjoint of the latter. We also denote by ⊗ the monoidal product in S
itself and by HOM its adjoint.
8.2. The functor s speciﬁes, in particular, a distinguished 1-multimorphism ∆ ∈ Hom(S, S; S).
By abuse of notation, we denote by ∆ (resp. ∆′) the corresponding 1-morphisms

∆ ∶ S ⊗ S → S

∆′ ∶ S → HOM(S, S).

By the arguments in the proof of the transitivity of biﬁbrations of multicategories (cf. Proposi-
tion 2.24), we see that we actually have

Corollary 8.3.

E ⊗ F = ∆●(E ⊠ F),

Hom(E,F) = (∆′)●(HOM(E,F)).

Example 8.4. Let us investigate the internal and external monoidal structure in the case S = S cor
(cf. Deﬁnition 3.1). Here the 1-morphisms ∆ and ∆′ are respectively given by the correspondences

From this we see that ∆● = ∆∗ and (∆′)● = ∆! holds.
In the other direction, we can also reconstruct the external monoidal product and its adjoint from
the internal one: The functor ⊠ is the push-forward along the coCartesian 1-morphism

Example 8.5. Let us investigate the internal and external monoidal structure in the case S = Diacor

Given a biﬁbration of 1-multi-categories D → S, this explains more conceptually the construction of
the “multi-pull-back” in the multicategory of functors Fun(I,D) in [13, Proposition 4.1.6.]. Using
Proposition 2.25 one can even reprove the Proposition [loc. cit.] in case that S is closed monoidal
(i.e. biﬁbred over {⋅}). Propositions 2.24 and 2.25 also show that it is basically the same to give an
absolute monoidal product and Hom in a derivator or to give a monoidal structure on the derivator.
The only condition being that the absolute monoidal product and Hom commute with left and right
Kan extensions.

Proposition 9.3.

1. Let D → S cor,0 be a proper six-functor-formalism (cf. 3.3).

If ∆f ∈ S0 (in most examples this is always the case) then there is a canonical natural trans-
formation

f! → f∗

which is an isomorphism if f ∈ S0.

2. Let D → S cor,0 be an etale six-functor-formalism (cf. 3.3). If ∆f ∈ S0 then there is a canonical

natural transformation

f ∗ → f !

which is an isomorphism if f ∈ S0.

In particular for a Wirthm¨uller context, we have a canonical isomorphism f ∗ ≅ f ! for all morphisms
f in S, and for a Grothendieck context, we have a canonical isomorphism f! ≅ f∗ for all morphisms
f in S. This justiﬁes the naming.

Proof. We prove 1. Claim 2. is shown analogously. To give a morphism as claimed is equivalent to
give a morphism

If f is in S0 then this is the counit of an adjunction and hence it induces a canonical isomorphism
f! ≅ f∗ (uniqueness of adjoints up to canonical isomorphism).

Example 9.4. From the properties of 1/2 (op)ﬁbrations of 2-multicategories one can derive many
compatibilities of the morphism f! → f∗. For example in a proper six-functor-formalism for a

the following diagram is 2-commutative

e.g. a monoidal derivator one does not have to start with a pre-multiderivator but could use an
arbitrary 1-biﬁbration and and 2-opﬁbration over Diacor, see 9.8 below.

is 1-opﬁbered and 2-ﬁbered with 1-categorical ﬁbers a (non-strict) pre-multiderivator as follows:

D

The Lemma shows that D is determined by ι∗D and can be reconstructed by the construction in
5.4 that associates Diacor(D) with a pre-multiderivator D.

10 The (co)localization property and n-angels in the ﬁbers of a

stable proper or etale derivator six-functor-formalism

10.1. For ((op)lax) ﬁbered derivators over an ((op)lax) 2-pre-derivator p ∶ D → S and an object
S ∈ S(I) we have that

DS ∶ J ↦ D(I × J)pr∗

2 S

is a usual derivator. We call p stable if DS is stable for all S ∈ S(I) and for all I.
10.2. Let S be a category and S0 a class of “proper” morphisms. Let

D → Scor,0,oplax

be a stable oplax derivator six-functor-formalism. The multi- (or tensor-) aspect will not play any
role in this section. The reasoning in this section has an “etale” analogue that we leave to the
reader to state.

If S is a category of some kind of spaces, we are often given a class of elementary squares
10.3.
as follows. Assume that in S there are certain distinguished morphisms called “closed immersions”
or “open immersions” respectively, with an operation of taking complements. For a morphism
f ∶ X → Y in S we denote by f , resp. f op the correspondences

j

/ X

be a sequence of “open embeddings”. And let i ∶ V ∖ U ↪ V , resp. j ○ i ∶ X ∖ U ↪ X be “closed
embeddings of the complements”. For now these morphism can be arbitrary, but to make sense of
these deﬁnitions in applications they should satisfy the properties of 10.4 below.
We then have the following square in ΞU,V,X ∈ Scor(◻):

Assume that the “closed embeddings” lie in the class S0 which was ﬁxed to deﬁne the notion of
proper derivator six-functor-formalism. Then the above square comes equipped with a morphism
ξ ∶ ΞU,V,X → p∗X in Scor,0,oplax(◻) represented by the cube (as a morphism from the front face to
the back face):

From now on, we forget about the provenience of these squares and just consider a proper derivator
six-functor-formalism

D → Scor,0,oplax

with a class of distinguised squares Ξ ∈ Scor(◻) with given morphisms ξ ∶ Ξ → p∗X in Scor,0,oplax(◻).
Deﬁnition 10.4. Let S be a 2-pre-derivator with all 2-morphisms invertible. We call a square
Ξ ∈ S(◻) Cartesian, if the natural functor

is an equivalence of groupoids for all X ∈ S(⋅), and coCartesian if the natural functor

Hom(X,(0, 0)∗Ξ) → Hom(p∗X, i∗

⌟Ξ)

Hom((1, 1)∗Ξ, X) → Hom(i∗

⌜Ξ, p∗X)

is an equivalence of groupoids for all X ∈ S(⋅). We call a square Ξ ∈ S(◻) biCartesian if it is
Cartesian and coCartesian.

Remark 10.5. If S is a usual derivator then this notion coincides with the usual notion [7].

One can show that the squares ΞU,V,X ∈ Scor(◻) constructed in the last paragraph are
10.6.
actually Cartesian in Scor provided that for all pairs U, X ∖ U of “open and closed embeddings”
used above we have

HomS(A, U) = {α ∈ HomS(A, X)   A ×α,X (X ∖ U ) = ∅}

and coCartesian provided that we have

HomS (A, X ∖ U ) = {α ∈ HomS (A, X)   A ×α,X U = ∅}

where ∅ is the initial object.

to an etale six-functor-formalism). We consider instead the square Ξ′

This means that for a stable proper derivator six-functor-formalism it is also reasonable to consider
a class of distinguised squares with given morphisms ξ′ ∶ p∗X → Ξ in Scor,0,lax(◻). The morphism
p∗X → Ξ′
U,V,X is just the dual of the morphism ΞU,V,X → p∗X for the absolute duality on Diacor(Scor)
(cf. 7.7).
Let i⌜ ∶ ⌜ ↪ ◻ and i⌟ ∶ ⌟ ↪ ◻ be the inclusions. Analogously to the situation for stable derivators
[7, 4.1] we deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 10.8. A square E ∈ D(◻) over Ξ ∈ S(◻) is called relatively coCartesian, if for the
inclusion i⌜ ∶ (⌜, i∗
⌜E is an isomorphism and is called relatively
Cartesian if for the inclusion i⌟ ∶ (⌟, i∗
⌟E → E is an isomorphism1. E
is called relatively biCartesian if it is relatively Cartesian and relatively coCartesian.

⌜Ξ) → (◻, Ξ) the unit E → i⌜,∗i∗

⌟Ξ) → (◻, Ξ) the counit i⌟,!i∗

If Ξ is itself (co)Cartesian in the sense of Deﬁnition 10.4 then E relatively (co)Cartesian implies
(co)Cartesian in the sense of Deﬁnition 10.4.
Lemma 10.9. Assume V = U and let D(◻)bicart
squares. Let (1, 0) ∶ (⋅, X) → (◻, ΞU,U,X) be the inclusion. Then the functor

be the full subcategory of relatively biCartesian

ΞU,U,X

and the composition

(1, 0)∗ ∶ D(◻)bicart

ΞU,U,X → D(⋅)X

D(⋅)X
deﬁne an equivalence of categories.
Also if V ~= U the functor 1∗0! takes values in relatively biCartesian squares.

/ D(→)U →X

1The functors i⌟,! and i⌜,∗ are in both cases considered w.r.t. the base Ξ.

Recall that we have for p∗X that

0∗ ∶ D(◻)bicart,0

p∗X → D(→)p∗X

p∗X

is the full subcategory of (relatively) biCartesian objects whose

is an equivalence, where D(◻)bicart,0
(1, 0)-entry is zero. This is a statement about usual derivators.
Deﬁnition 10.10. We say that a distinguished square Ξ together with ξ ∶ Ξ → p∗X is a localizing
square if the push-forward ξ● maps relatively biCartesian squares to relatively biCartesian squares.
We say that a distinguished square Ξ together with ξ ∶ p∗X → Ξ is a colocalizing square if the
pull-back ξ● maps relatively biCartesian squares to relatively biCartesian squares.
If every object in D(⋅) is dualizable w.r.t. the absolute monoidal product in Diacor(D) then ξ ∶ Ξ →
p∗X is localizing if and only if ξ∨ ∶ p∗X → Ξ∨ is colocalizing.
Remark 10.11. If the proper derivator six-functor-formalism with its oplax extension

is stable and the square ΞU,V,X constructed above is distinguished, then the property of being a
localizing square implies that for E ∈ D(⋅)X the triangle

D → Scor,0,oplax

j!E ⊕ E
is distinguished. If U = V this is just the sequence

/ (j ○ i)!i

j!j!E

∗

/ j ○ i∗j ○ i

∗E [1]

Remark 10.12. If the proper derivator six-functor-formalism with its lax extension

j!j!E

/ E

/ j ∗j

∗E [1]

D → Scor,0,lax

is stable and the square ΞU,V,X constructed above is distinguished then the property of being a
colocalizing square implies that for E ∈ D(⋅)X the triangle
/ (j ○ i)∗i∗(j ○ i)!E ⊕ E

j ○ i!j ○ i
!E

/ j∗j∗E [1]

is distinguished. If U = V this is just the sequence:

j!j

!E

/ E

/ j∗j∗E [1]

Deﬁnition 10.13. We say that the proper derivator six-functor-formalism with its extension as
left ﬁbered derivator to

D → Scor,0,oplax

D → Scor,0,lax

65

satisﬁes the localization property w.r.t. a class of distinguished squares ξ ∶ Ξ → p∗X if those
are localizing squares.
We say that the proper derivator six-functor-formalism with its extension as right ﬁbered derivator
to

satisﬁes the colocalization property w.r.t. a class of distinguished squares ξ ∶ p∗X → Ξ if those

There is an analogous notion in which an etale derivator-six-functor-formalism w.r.t. a class of
“etale morphisms” S0 in S satisﬁes the (co)localization property

10.14. Consider again the situation in 10.3. More generally we may consider a sequence

of open embeddings. They lead to a diagram Ξ

in which all the squares are biCartesian in Scor. Starting from an object E ∈ D(⋅)Xn we may form
again

0∗(n)!E

where (n) ∶ ⋅ → [n] is the inclusion of the last object and 0 ∶ [n] → Ξ is the inclusion of the ﬁrst
line. It is easy to see that in the object 0∗(n)!E all squares are biCartesian. There is furthermore a
morphism ξ ∶ Ξ → p∗Xn in Scor,0,oplax again such that all squares in ξ●0∗(n)!E are biCartesian with
zero’s along the diagonal. This category is equivalent to D([n])p∗Xn by the embedding of the ﬁrst
line. It can be seen as a category of n-angels in the stable derivator DXn (the ﬁber of D over X).
Hence for an oplax derivator six-functor-formalism with localization property, and for any ﬁltration
of a space X by n open subspaces, and for any object E ∈ D(⋅)X we get a corresponding n-angle in
the derivator DX.
