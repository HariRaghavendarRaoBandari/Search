Abstract

Among measurements of the neutron lifetime, there is a 1% diﬀerence between

proton-counting methods and neutron-counting methods. In this paper, a new

electron-counting method with a magnetic ﬁeld aiming for a 0.1% accuracy is

proposed, which would have a possibility to probe the discrepancy.

Keywords: Neutron lifetime; Pulsed cold neutron; Electron-counting method

1. Introduction

According to the Particle Data Group, the neutron lifetime is reported as
880.3 ± 1.1 s in 2015 [1]. However, there is a 1% discrepancy, i.e., 8.4 ± 2.2
s, between two methods: counting surviving ultra-cold neutrons after storing
(879.6 ± 0.8 s [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) and counting trapped protons from the neutron
decay (888.0 ± 2.1 s [7, 8]). A proposed experiment in this paper employs an
electron-counting method, based on experiments at ILL [9, 10, 11] and J-PARC

[12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Pulsed neutron beams pass through a time projection

chamber (TPC) with a gas mixture of 4He : CO2 : 3He = 85 kPa : 15 kPa :

100 mPa, which detects electrons from the neutron decay, and also measures

the neutron ﬂux with mixed 3He; A neutron captured in 3He emits a 573 keV

proton and a 191 keV triton, namely the 3He(n, p)3H reaction. Analyzing events

in the period when the neutron pulse is completely inside the TPC, the same

ﬁducial volume can be used for both reactions. The cold neutron pulses with a

velocity of about 1000 m/s have a length of approximately half the TPC.

The neutron lifetime, τ , can be described with the number of the neutron

decay, Nβ, and the 3He(n, p)3H reaction, N3He, as follows:

where v is the neutron velocity, and σ is the cross section of the 3He(n, p)3H

reaction. The number density of 3He is represented as ρ, which depends on the

pressure of 3He, P , and the temperature along with the neutron beam inside

the ﬁducial volume, T . Since σ for cold neutrons is inversely proportional to

the neutron velocity, σv can be treated as a constant.

2. A proposed method for the neutron lifetime experiment

Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the proposed experiment, where a TPC

is housed in a solenoid coil. To consider the setup, I refered to the solenoid

magnet for the Perkeo III experiment [17]; The operation ﬁeld is 1.5 kG; The
dimension for the inner surface of the magnet is 50 cm (φ) × 200 cm (L).

Anode (cathode) wires are assumed to be perpendicular (parallel) to the beam axis. Arrows

shows drift directions.

In a magnetic ﬁeld of B [kG], the radius of curvature of R [cm] for a charged

particle with a mass of m [MeV/c2] can be denoted as follows:

where p [MeV/c] and T [MeV] are momentum and kinetic energy of the charged

particle. For a 782 keV electron, corresponding to the maximum kinetic energy

of electrons from the neutron decay, the radius of curvature is calculated to be

2.6 cm. The TPC is divided into three regions by anode and cathode wires,
and the drift direction in each region is indicated by arrows. A B × E eﬀect on
the drift direction is about 3◦, assuming an electric ﬁeld of 300 V/cm. Thus,
electrons from the neutron decay and their ionised electrons are conﬁned in the

signal region shown as the shadow area.

Neutrons passing through the TPC are sometimes scattered by gases and

captured in the structure of the detector system. Then, prompt γ-rays are

produced via the (n,γ) reaction and induce Compton electrons inside the TPC,

which are irreducible background events for the neutron decay. The surface of

the TPCs for the experiments at ILL and J-PARC were covered by 6Li tiles,

since 6Li has a large neutron absorption cross section without emitting the

prompt γ-rays. However, a 0.9% uncertainty on the subtraction of the Compton

electrons was still remained, according to the result at ILL et al. [10]. For the

experiment in J-PARC, this uncertainty would be dominant, since the other

systematic uncertainties would be suppressed [16]. Note that these two TPCs

had a single drift direction without a magnetic ﬁeld.

The proposed TPC having the three regions with the solenoid coil would

eliminate the Compton electrons by requiring no hits outside the signal region,

since the Compton electrons are mainly originated from the structure of the

TPC, e.g., the 6Li tiles. As a result, the uncertainty on the subtraction of the

Compton electrons would be negligible.

3. Conclusion

A new electron-counting method for the neutron lifetime is proposed. The

TPC counts electrons from neutron decay and the 3He(n, p)3H reaction for the

3

neutron ﬂux in the same ﬁducial volume. The current main systematic uncer-

tainties are related to the subtraction of background events against electrons

from the neutron decay. The newly introduced magnetic and electric ﬁelds for

the TPC signiﬁcantly reduce the uncertainty, which would reach a 0.1% ac-

curacy and oﬀer a clue to help resolve the 1% discrepancy among the current

neutron lifetime measurements.
