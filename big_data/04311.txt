The currently accepted magnetic ground state of Sr2IrO4 (the − + +− state) preserves inversion
symmetry. This is at odds, though, with two experiments that indicate a magnetoelectric ground
state, leading to the speculation that orbital currents or more exotic magnetic multipoles might
exist in this material. Here, we analyze various magnetic ground states and demonstrate that both
the magnetoelectric − + −+ state and the non-magnetoelectric + + ++ state can explain recent
second-harmonic generation (SHG) experiments, obviating the need to invoke orbital currents. The
SHG-probed magnetic order parameter has the symmetry of a parity-breaking multipole in the
− +−+ state and of a parity-preserving multipole in the + + ++ state. We suggest several resonant
x-ray scattering (RXS) experiments that could be performed to choose between these two models,
and also address the important issue of the suppression of the RXS intensity at the L2 edge.

INTRODUCTION

The physical properties of layered iridates, in particu-
lar Sr2IrO4, have been thoroughly investigated since the
seminal paper of B. J. Kim and collaborators [1] and their
suggested analogy with the physics of cuprate supercon-
ductors. The formation of a half-ﬁlled t2g doublet by the
strong Ir spin-orbit interaction, that is then gapped by
correlations, mimics what is seen in the cuprates, making
Sr2IrO4 an insulator, despite its Ir4+ ionic conﬁguration
with ﬁve occupied t2g electrons [1, 2]. More recent ex-
periments on doped iridates point to the emergence of a
pseudogap [3] and at low temperatures a d-wave gap [4],
therefore strengthening the analogy with cuprates. Most
recently, a new experiment based on second-harmonic
generation (SHG) [5] claimed the detection of an odd-
parity, magnetic hidden order in Sr2IrO4, suggesting the
presence of orbital currents as proposed by Varma for
cuprates [6]. This followed an earlier bulk property study
indicating a giant magnetoelectric eﬀect in Sr2IrO4 [7].
Despite these analogies, there are also signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between Sr2IrO4 and La2CuO4. First, the insu-
lating gap has a diﬀerent character, spin-orbit plus Mott
versus charge transfer, therefore doped holes in Sr2IrO4
go into the Ir 5d states, and not in the oxygen 2p ones
as in La2CuO4. Second, the 5d states of Ir are much
more spatially extended than the 3d states of Cu, mak-
ing the on-site Coulomb and exchange terms signiﬁcantly
weaker. Therefore, the physical motivation for orbital
currents, based as it is on the near degeneracy of the
transition metal d and oxygen p states [6], seems unlikely
in the iridate case, where the oxygen 2p bands lie more
than 3 eV below the Ir t2g doublet [8].

The aim of the present paper is the following: 1) We
analyze the magnetic symmetries of Sr2IrO4, derive the
resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) structure factors, and

present ab initio calculations at the Ir L3 edge in order
to identify the ﬁngerprints of the −+−+ and ++++ pat-
terns. 2) We analyze the symmetries of the SHG experi-
ment by writing explicit quantum-mechanical expressions
for the tensors involved. This allows us to show that only
two magnetic space groups are consistent with a mag-
netic order-parameter for the SHG experiment. The ﬁrst
is 2(cid:48)/m, advocated in Ref. 5, which is also the magnetic
space group of the −+−+ magnetic pattern. The second
is 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48), which is the magnetic group corresponding to
the + + ++ pattern in an external magnetic ﬁeld [9]. 3)
We reanalyze the spin and orbital ground-state proper-
ties of Sr2IrO4 in the magnetic phase below TN in order
to clarify what can and what cannot be deduced from the
RXS experiments, and also address the important issue
of the suppression of the RXS intensity at the L2 edge.
We conclude by proposing new x-ray absorption (XAS)
and RXS experiments to not only test our proposed ex-
planation for the SHG experiment, but also designed to
give a clear ﬁngerprint for the existence of the Jeﬀ = 1/2
doublet state.

To reach our aims, the present article is organized as
follows: In Section II, we review the details of the crystal
and magnetic symmetries of Sr2IrO4, and show how RXS
data on Rh-doped samples can be explained in terms of
the − + −+ state as well as the previously suggested
+ + ++ state [10–12]. We suggest further experiments
to clearly identify the actual magnetic pattern. Section
III is devoted to an analysis of the SHG experiment from
the quantum-mechanical microscopic expressions of the
tensors involved. As stated above, we ﬁnd that both the
magnetic space group 2(cid:48)/m of the − + −+ state and the
magnetic space group 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) of the + + ++ state can ex-
plain the SHG data. We characterize the multipole ranks
of the order parameters identiﬁed by the SHG experiment
for each magnetic group. In particular, for the 2(cid:48)/m mag-

netic space group of the − +−+ state, the allowed order
parameters have the symmetry of inversion-odd magnetic
multipoles of rank one, two and three: toroidal dipole,
magnetic quadrupole and toroidal octupole (the mag-
netic quadrupole, though, does not contribute in an SS
polarization geometry). Instead, for the 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) magnetic
space group of the + + ++ state, the allowed order pa-
rameters have the symmetry of inversion-even magnetic
multipoles up to rank three: magnetic toroidal monopole,
magnetic dipole, magnetic toroidal quadrupole and mag-
netic octupole.
In Section IV, we address the results
obtained in the literature on the doublet Jeﬀ = 1/2 of
Sr2IrO4. We discuss some of the critical aspects of this
doublet and clarify its connection to the RXS experi-
ments. Finally, in Section V, ab initio simulations for
some key XAS and RXS experiments are presented, with
the dual goal of conﬁrming (or modifying) the Jeﬀ = 1/2
doublet picture, and also to test the two proposed mag-
netic symmetries we suggest to explain the SHG experi-
ment [5]. Some conclusions are oﬀered in Section VI.

II. CRYSTAL AND MAGNETIC SYMMETRIES

IN Sr2IrO4: ANALYSIS OF RESONANT

STRUCTURE FACTORS

The original analysis of the crystal space group of
Sr2IrO4 suggested I41/acd [13], with the 8 Ir ions in this
unit cell related by the symmetry operations of the 8a site
of I41/acd, as detailed in Table I. For future reference,
we note that, though the point symmetry of the Ir site is
4, the further reduction from the 4/m point symmetry,
and therefore the breaking of inversion symmetry, is de-
termined only by the oxygens in the IrO2 planes above
(below) that of the Ir, and these are quite distant (> 6.5
˚A). For this reason, the eﬀect of inversion-breaking at an
Ir site, though non-zero, is extremely small. Of course,
inversion symmetry in the unit cell is restored for the
global symmetry I41/acd.

Very recently, the crystal structure has been resolved
by neutron scattering to be rather I41/a [11], explaining
the observation of forbidden Bragg peaks in earlier ex-
periments [14, 15] and in keeping with recent SHG data
[16]. Within this space group, the 8 Ir atoms in the unit
cell split into two nonequivalent groups of 4 atoms, each
with the same point group 4 (sites 4a and 4b). The same
remark concerning the inversion breaking made above
still applies, as the symmetry reduction from I41/acd to
I41/a, leading to the loss of the two glide planes contain-
ing the c axis, is just determined by a tiny displacement of
the planar oxygen atoms (< 0.1%). As all the symmetry
analysis in the literature up to now has been performed
with the I41/acd space group, in what follows, we shall
use both the I41/acd and I41/a space groups, highlight-
ing any diﬀerences between the two.

In the I41/acd space group (settings 2) [13], the 8 Ir
atoms occupy the positions shown in Table I, in fractional
units (with a=b=5.4846 ˚A, c=25.804 ˚A) [13]. They are

2

characterized by a surrounding distorted oxygen octahe-
dron, as shown in Fig. 1 for basal ab-planes, with api-
cal oxygens along the c-axis at 2.057 ˚A and planar oxy-
gens at 1.979 ˚A, with a tetragonal distortion of 4%. The
planar oxygens are rotated by about 12◦ around the c-
axis: this rotation is the basis of the loss of the I4/mmm
space-group symmetry that characterizes the analogous
compound, Ba2IrO4. Below TN (cid:39) 230 K, an antiferro-
magnetic state develops, characterized by magnetic mo-
ments lying in the ab-plane and forming an angle of about
12◦ with the a-axis, as shown in Fig. 1. The in-plane
magnetic pattern is such as to have an antiferromag-
netic order parameter along the a-axis and a ferromag-
netic component along the b-axis (smaller by the ratio
sin 12◦/ cos 12◦), leading to the loss of tetragonal sym-
metry. The ferromagnetic component is however com-
pensated when summed up over the four IrO2 layers of
the unit cell. In the undoped compound, the ferromag-
netic component along the b-axis has the pattern −++−
[9], as shown in Fig. 1.

In order to write down the resonant x-ray structure
factor at the Ir L3 edge, we need to know the magnetic
symmetry relations among the 8 Ir atoms of the 8a site.
In order to allow for comparison with previous work, we
list in Table I the Ir atoms with the − + +− pattern and
the symmetry operations that need to be applied to the
ﬁrst Ir atom in order to obtain the others (this column,
for the ﬁrst atom, corresponds to its point-group sym-
metries). For future convenience, we list also two other
patterns of the ferromagnetic component, that we call,
analogous to the − + +− pattern, the + + ++ and the
− + −+ patterns, as shown in Fig. 1. The + + ++
structure has been identiﬁed as the magnetic structure
of Sr2IrO4 in a magnetic ﬁeld (H ≥ 0.3 T) directed in
the ab-plane [9, 17] and also suggested as the magnetic
structure in Rh-doped samples [10, 11]. The − + −+
magnetic structure has not been suggested in the liter-
ature up to now, but we claim that it describes as well
some of the experimental results on Rh-doped samples,
as detailed below [12]. Both patterns can explain the
SHG experiment, as we shall see below.

Here ˆT , ˆI and ˆE are the time-reversal operator, the
inversion and the identity, and ˆmi and ˆC2i are the mir-
ror symmetry and the two-fold rotation around the axis
i (x, y, z parallel to a, b, c). Taking into account these
symmetries, the resonant x-ray structure factor for the
− + +− pattern, summed over the 8 Ir atoms, can be
written as:

F −++−

hkl

∝(1 + ˆT (−1)h+k+l)(1 + ˆI(i)2k+l)
(1 + ˆT ˆmx(−1)h+k)f1

(1)

where f1 is the resonant atomic scattering amplitude for
Ir atom 1 (see, e.g., Ref. 18). Below, we write, for future
use, the structure factors for the two other patterns, + +
++ and − +−+. It is important to notice that both the
++++ and −+−+ magnetic structures are characterized

8 , as shown in Fig. 1. This implies
that the time-reversal symmetry relating Ir1 and Ir5 in

8 and z = 7

Eq. (1) is replaced by the identity (see Eqs. (2) and (3)).
The diﬀerence between the two structures lies in the way
(for example) layer z = 7
8 . For
the + + ++ structure, Ir1 and Ir2 atoms are related by
inversion, as for the − + +− structure, whereas for the
− + −+ structure, Ir1 and Ir2 atoms are related by ˆT ˆI.
This is the second factor in the right-hand side of Eqs. (2)
and (3). Overall, the corresponding structure factors are:

We remark that the last factor (1 + ˆT ˆmx(−1)h+k) is
unchanged in all three patterns because it relates the two
in-plane Ir atoms, whose relative behavior is not aﬀected
by the overall stacking along the c-axis. This term is

when the symmetry is reduced to I41/a. In fact, such a
reduction is determined by the breaking of the ˆmx (and
ˆmy) symmetry. This implies that (for example) Ir1 and
Ir3 atoms in Table I now belong to two inequivalent sites
(4a and 4b). This in turn leads to the altered structure
factors:

We notice for the next section on SHG interpretation
that all the previous equations are equally valid for the
SHG experiment by putting h = k = l = 0 (in the op-
tical regime, only the zone center is involved). Interest-
ingly, this shows that optical reﬂections in the − + +−
pattern are only sensitive to time reversal and parity-
even observables, otherwise the (1 + ˆT )(1 + ˆI) prefactor
of Eq. (4) would be zero. Likewise, optical reﬂections
in the + + ++ pattern are only sensitive to parity-even
quantities (both magnetic and non-magnetic, see Eq. (5))
and in the − +−+ pattern they are sensitive to ˆT ˆI-even
observables (i.e., either magnetic, parity-odd multipoles,
or non-magnetic parity-even ones).

We are now ready to analyze some x-ray key reﬂections
at the L3 edge. There are two groups of resonant x-ray
reﬂections that have been studied in the literature and
deliver two independent pieces of information.
In the ﬁrst group, we have those reﬂections which
served to identify the −++− magnetic space group of the
stoichiometric compound. They are of the kind (1,0,4n),
(0,1,4n+2) [19] and (0,0,2n+1), that we analyze within

4

the I41/acd space group to compare with the existing lit-
erature. Later, we shall highlight the diﬀerences induced
by the reduction to I41/a. From Eq. (1), as h+k+l is odd,
these three reﬂections must be magnetic in the − + +−
state, and they vanish for the other two patterns. Their
presence is therefore a signature of the − + +− state.
Notice also that for σπ scattering, f1 is proportional to
(cid:126)ko · (cid:126)m ≡ mko (with (cid:126)ko the outgoing scattering vector, (cid:126)m
the magnetic moment). The selection rule imposed by
the term (1 + ˆT ˆmx(−1)h+k) gives a signal proportional
to (1 + ˆmx)mko ∝ ma for both F −++−
1,0,4n and F −++−
0,1,4n+2.
Here ma is the projection of the magnetic moment along
the a-axis. Instead, for F −++−
0,0,2n+1, the signal is propor-
tional to (1 − ˆmx)mko ∝ mb, as noted earlier [20]. This
method allows one to obtain the direction of the mag-
netic moment (the rotation angle of (cid:39) 12◦ reported in
the literature) by means of the ratio of the ma to the mb
components. However, this assumes the I41/acd space
group. The reduction to I41/a implies the breakdown of
the (1 + ˆT ˆmx(−1)h+k) selection rule due to the inequiv-
alence of Ir1 and Ir3. Though this reduction is small,
as stated above, it could lead to changes in the rotation
angle, and it might be worthwhile to repeat this analy-
sis for I41/a, as now the magnetic moments of the two
in-plane Ir atoms become inequivalent and are allowed
to point in diﬀerent directions (though the argument of
Ref. 2 should still impose a locking with the rotation of
the oxygen octahedra). As a last remark on the I41/acd
to I41/a symmetry reduction, we emphasize that it does
not play any role for the coupling along the c-axis, as the
symmetry that it breaks is the one that links the two Ir
atoms in the same plane.

A second group of reﬂections more interesting for our
work, as they are key to interpreting the SHG experi-
ment, are of the kind (1,0,4n±1) (similarly (0,1,4n±1)).
These reﬂections indicate an alteration of the − + +−
conﬁguration due to either applying a small magnetic
ﬁeld in the stoichiometric material [9] or by Rh doping
[10, 11], where in both cases they were suggested as be-
ing signatures of the + + ++ state. We show below that
this is not necessarily the case, as the − + −+ conﬁg-
uration can give rise to the same magnetic and charge
reﬂections, and further investigation is needed to disen-
tangle the two patterns, at least in the case of Rh doping
[12]. As before, we start our analysis with the I41/acd
space group. For these reﬂections h+k+l is even, but the
reﬂections (1,0,4n±1) are Bragg forbidden since h + k is
odd. These reﬂections can however be explained as mag-
netic in origin (but can also be non-magnetic in I41/a
space group, see below) if the system undergoes a phase
transition from the − + +− conﬁguration to either the
+ + ++ conﬁguration or the − + −+ conﬁguration. If
this is the case, the structure factors become:
1,0,4n±1 ∝ (1 ± i)ma
F ++++
and
1,0,4n±1 ∝ (1 ∓ i)ma
F −+−+

(8)

(7)

They lead to the same intensity, so from a purely mag-
netic analysis, they cannot be diﬀerentiated. We should
notice here that care is needed in identifying the or-
thorhombic a and b axes, as reversing them might lead to
an incorrect pattern identiﬁcation. In fact, switching h
and k Miller indices corresponds to switching the ++++
and − + −+ patterns:

5

0,1,4n±1 ∝ (1 ∓ i)ma
F ++++
and
0,1,4n±1 ∝ (1 ± i)ma.
F −+−+
In all these expressions, ma is the a-axis component of
the magnetic moment at sites Ir1 and Ir3 (diﬀerence of
f1 and f3).

(10)

(9)

In order to disentangle the two magnetic patterns, we
need to play on the diﬀerences between the ˆT ˆI and ˆI
operators that relate f1 to f2. This can only be done
by allowing an interference with the charge scattering.
In fact, the charge scattering in resonant conditions is
not only given by the (scalar) Bragg scattering, but also
by the anisotropic scattering that does not obey the ex-
tinction rule (1 + ˆmx(−1)h+k) = 0, because the mirror
symmetry is not necessarily +1. The intensity of the
charge scattering at these (1,0,4n± 1) reﬂections will be
increased by the symmetry reduction to the I41/a space
group. As stated above, such a group breaks the ˆmx-
symmetry, violating the above extinction rule, even at
the level of the scalar charge scattering, and in fact the
existence of these reﬂections in neutron scattering above
TN have been taken to be a signature of this space group
[14]. For RXS, magnetic and non-magnetic terms are
out of phase by π/2. This implies that, writing the non-
magnetic atomic scattering factor as fc (in the I41/a space
group, from Eqs. (5) and (6), it is fc
3) and the mag-
netic one as fm (= fm
3 ), apart from an overall phase
factor, the structure factors can be written as:

1 −fm

1−fc

1,0,4n±1 ∝ (1±i)f c∓(1∓i)f m = (f c∓f m)±i(f c±f m)
˜F ++++
(11)

(12)

and
1,0,4n±1 ∝ (1 ± i)(f c ± f m)
˜F −+−+
From these expressions, we see that the interference of
magnetic and non-magnetic terms allows diﬀerentiating
the two patterns. In the case of the + + ++ pattern, the
signals at (1,0,4n+1) and (1,0,4n−1) are identical (apart
from the diﬀerent geometrical factors due to the diﬀerent
(cid:126)Q). But, they are diﬀerent for the − + −+ pattern due
to the constructive/destructive interference seen in these
expressions. A numerical simulation of these ﬁndings by
the FDMNES code (see Section V) is reported in Fig. 2.
We should remark here on an important warning for
In the previous six equations, we have

this analysis.

and (b) the (0,1,4n-1) and (0,1,4n+1) reﬂections. These sim-
ulations were performed with the FDMNES code for a cluster
radius of 6.5 ˚A and a Hubbard U on the Ir sites of 2 eV. For
(10L), the azimuthal angle was 0◦ and for (01L), it was 90◦. In
all cases, the polarization geometry was SP, with an assumed
core-hole lifetime of 5.25 eV. Similar oscillations are found for
a cluster radius of 3 ˚A, though they are less pronounced.

treated the atomic scattering factors fc and fm as if
they were real quantities, whereas, close to an edge,
they are complex, because of the energy denominator
(ω − ∆E + iΓ), where ∆E measures the energy dif-
ference of the two levels related by the photon transi-
tion and Γ measures the inverse of the core-hole life-
time. If, however, we are very close to a resonance, then
|ω − ∆E| (cid:28) Γ, and the denominator becomes purely
imaginary and all the previous discussion on interferences
keeps its validity (Fig. 2, being at the L3 maximum, cor-
responds to this case). Of course, the same is true in the
opposite, non-resonant case: |ω − ∆E| (cid:29) Γ. It is not,
however, true when |ω − ∆E| ∼ Γ, or if two resonances
are suﬃciently close to one another.

Even though magnetic neutron scattering diﬀers from
magnetic RXS (in particular, no resonant denominator),
in Ref. 11, the authors ﬁnd a diﬀerent signal at (101)
and at (103) in the spin-ﬂip versus non-spin-ﬂip ratios.

point to the − + −+ conﬁguration. In RXS, this shows
us as an alternation of the (10L) (L odd) intensity versus
L for − + −+ (due to the above mentioned interference)
as opposed to the smooth dependence for the + + ++
conﬁguration, which, as we show in Fig. 2, is quite pro-
nounced in ab initio calculations. A smooth behavior
versus L was seen by Clancy et al.
for their Rh-doped
samples [10] which is probably why they advocated the
+ + ++ state over the − + −+ state. One issue is that
their azimuthal plots indicate multi-domain eﬀects. An-
other is that the energy at which the measurement was
performed might have induced extra interference due to
the energy denominator, as discussed above. We suggest
that additional RXS and neutron experiments on single
domains be performed to check which pattern (− + −+
or + + ++) is actually induced by Rh doping. Regard-
less, both −+−+ and ++++ conﬁgurations can explain
the SHG experiment [5], without the need to invoke ex-
otic magnetic symmetries. As shown in the Table II, the
− + −+ state has the magnetic space group 2(cid:48)/m, and
the + + ++ state the 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) one. As detailed in the next
Section, both are compatible with the SHG result.

III. A REANALYSIS OF THE SYMMETRIES OF

THE SHG EXPERIMENT

In this Section, we reanalyze the SHG experiment [5],
listing all the symmetries that allow one to address the
experimental results. In subsection A we deﬁne the two
susceptibility tensors, χ(e) and χ(m), possibly involved in
the interference pattern with the high-temperature sig-
nal, determined by χ(q) [16]. Both tensors should be
investigated on the same footing because it is known,
e.g., for Cr2O3, that the magnetic part [21] of χ(e) and
χ(m) are of the same order of magnitude [22]. We also
identify the symmetry of the order parameters associ-
ated with χ(e) and χ(m) for linear polarizations and their
multipolar ranks. Then, in subsection B, we evaluate the
diﬀerent azimuthal dependences of χ(e) and χ(m). This,
together with a full analysis of the magnetic symmetries
of Sr2IrO4 and the ﬁndings of subsection A, allows us
to point towards the following interpretation of the SHG
experiment [5]: only two magnetic space groups can ex-
plain the interference pattern of the SHG experiment.
The former is 2(cid:48)/m (as already suggested in Ref. 5).
The associated order parameters are all inversion and
time-reversal odd, with the symmetry of either a toroidal
dipole, a magnetic quadrupole or a toroidal octupole (the
magnetic quadrupole cannot be observed in SS geome-
try). The latter is 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48), which is characterized by an
order parameter with the symmetry of either a mag-
netic toroidal monopole, a magnetic dipole, a magnetic
toroidal quadrupole or a magnetic octupole.
In either
case, we suggest that the observed symmetry reduction
is not determined by exotic magnetic patterns, but by a
transition to the − + −+ state (2(cid:48)/m group), or to the

+ + ++ state (2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) group). How this transition can
happen is discussed at the end of this Section.

A. Order parameters associated with SHG tensors

Second harmonic generation is a third-order process
in the matter-radiation interaction, determined by two
absorptions of a photon ω and the emission of a pho-
ton 2ω [23], as pictorially described in Fig. 3. The full
cross-section and its explicit derivation are reported in
Appendix A.1. We repeat here just the expression of the
two processes depicted in Fig. 3, that are at the basis of
the interference signal detected in Ref. 5 in the magnetic
phase of Sr2IrO4. The purely electric-dipole (E1-E1-E1)
amplitude, from Eq. (A3), is:

χ(e,j)

We can analogously deﬁne the doubly electric, singly

magnetic transitions (E1-E1-M1) as:

A sum over repeated variables α, β, γ = x, y, z is em-
ployed. The previous equations express third-order per-
αβγ and χ(m,j,i)
turbation theory. Cartesian tensors χ(e,i)
represent the properties of the sample and O(e,i)
αβγ and
O(m,j,i)
those of incoming and outgoing polarizations and
wave-vectors. The explicit expression for the latter is re-
ported in Appendix A.1. Similarly, one can deﬁne the
analogous quadrupole (E1-E1-E2) quantity, χ(q,j,i)
αβγ . For
symmetry reasons, the M1 and E2 transitions can appear
at any of the three positions and this is the origin of the
extra index i (pictorially shown for χ(m) in Fig. 3). Using
the notation Eij = Ei − Ej, the explicit expressions of
two of the susceptibility tensors are:

In the following in this Section, we remove
the (l, n) labels to simplify notation. As shown in Ap-
pendix A.1, we have the property: η(e,1) = η(e,2) =
η(e,3) ≡ η(e). The full set of components for η(m,j,i)
is reported in Appendix A.1. We remark that χ(e,1)
and χ(m,1,1) deﬁned in the previous equations should
not be directly compared as they are not dimension-
ally homogeneous (χ(m,1,1)/χ(e,1) ∼ length ∼ λ/2π, see
Eqs. (A21) to (A32)). We also notice that the quantities
χ(e,i)
αβγ;ln correspond to the SHG suscep-
tibilities usually deﬁned in the literature (e.g., Ref. 23)
from the macroscopic relation: (cid:126)P (2ω) = χ : (cid:126)E(ω) (cid:126)E(ω).
Analogously for χ(m,j,i)
αβγ . The only diﬀer-
ence is that in the quantum-mechanical approach, all
αβγ and χ(m,j,i)
the processes depicted in Fig. 3 for χ(e,i)
must be considered. The three denominators, ∆(1)
l,n, ∆(2)
l,n
and ∆(3)
l,n weight the three quantum-mechanical transi-
tion amplitudes leading to the SHG signal (two resonant
processes, only one resonant process, no resonant pro-
cesses), as shown in Fig. 3. The total scattering ampli-
tude, ASHG, is obtained, as for RXS, by a scalar cou-
pling of each tensor representing the properties of the
sample, to the corresponding components of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. The full SHG amplitude, reported in
Eq. (A3), is then composed of terms of the kind: ASHG ∼

We remind that in the SHG community [22, 23], the
notation Pα = erα and Mα = µB(Lα +2Sα) is more often
employed. We shall use it in the next subsection.

As clear from the deﬁnitions, χ(e) is characterized by
all three transitions (the two at frequency ω and the one
at frequency 2ω) of electric-dipole character (therefore in-
version odd), and χ(m) is characterized by one magnetic-
dipole and two electric-dipole transitions (therefore in-
version even). They can both interfere with the electric-
quadrupole tensor χ(q) (deﬁned in Appendix A.1, charac-
terized by one electric-quadrupole and two electric-dipole
transitions). We remind that in the high-temperature
phase of Sr2IrO4, the total SHG signal has been at-
tributed to χ(q) [5]. From Eqs. (A4), (A6) and (A15)
in Appendix A, η(q) contains an extra factor of i com-
ing from the expansion of ei(cid:126)k·(cid:126)r, and this determines the
phase shift of π/2 of its matrix elements with respect to
those of the η(e) term. Following the analysis reported in
Appendix A.2, we have therefore that the time-reversal
even part of η(q) is imaginary (and the time-reversal odd
part of η(q) real); the time-reversal even part of η(e) is
real (and its time-reversal odd part is imaginary); ﬁnally,

7

the time-reversal even part of η(m) is imaginary (and its
time-reversal odd part is real). This implies that, in the
non-resonant regime where denominators are real, the
time-reversal even part of χ(q) can interfere with both
the time-reversal odd part of χ(e) and with the time-
reversal even part of χ(m), but not with the time-reversal
even part of χ(e) and with the time-reversal odd part of
χ(m). However, the presence of the imaginary damping
factors iΓn in the resonant denominators scrambles up
this analysis, as detailed in Appendix A.2, so that all
terms can interfere among themselves. Yet, this analysis
in terms of η(e,m,q)
αβγ;ln without the resonant denominator is
fundamental, as in the case of RXS, in order to identify
the time-reversal properties of the order parameters as-
sociated with this process, that are determined just by
the matrix elements. We remind, in fact, that the phys-
ical origin of the complex numerators and denominators
in second-order, Kramers-Kronig-like, or third-order ex-
pressions (SHG) is profoundly diﬀerent. The imaginary
unit in the numerator is a consequence of magnetism: in
the absence of magnetism, eigenstates Φj can be chosen
as real and all matrix elements η(e,m,q)
αβγ;ln (see Appendix
A.2) would be real as well. Therefore, the time-reversal
symmetry of the matrix elements η(e,m,q)
αβγ;ln is related to
their real and imaginary parts. The imaginary unit in
the denominator is, instead, a consequence of damping
due to spontaneous emission [24]: that sign cannot be
changed, because damping is irreversible.

The previous classiﬁcation reminds one of the simpler
RXS case [18, 25]. There are however several diﬀerences,
because of the intrinsic asymmetry of the SHG amplitude
(two photons ω in; one photon 2ω out). For example,
it is well known that the E1-E1 approximation in RXS
leads to a time-reversal odd, imaginary part of the matter
tensor, which is proportional to the magnetic dipole and
out × in. This in turn implies that
is scalarly coupled to ∗
for E1-E1, no magnetic signal occurs in the σσ channel
(in the following, we denote the polarization σ as S and
π as P to align with the notation of Ref. 5). This is
not the case for SHG, because of the asymmetry of the
l,n with respect to the exchange n ↔ l,
denominators ∆(i)
as shown in detail in Appendix A: indeed, a magnetic SS
signal is quite common in SHG [23].

The general classiﬁcation of the order parameters as-
sociated with the transition matrix elements in the SHG
susceptibilities is quite lengthy and will be treated in a
future publication. As already reported in Ref. 26 for
second-order susceptibilities, the order parameters in the
optical regime, diﬀerently from the x-ray regime, are cor-
relation functions, which are much harder to analyze.
Here we focus on the SHG experiment of Ref. 5 and, in
particular, consider just the symmetry of the order pa-
rameter associated with the χ(e) and χ(m) tensors when
the incoming and outgoing electric ﬁelds are linearly po-
larized, and therefore real.

Consider for example χ(e) and Eq. (A42). A(e)

SHG is a
scalar quantity, invariant under any magnetic-symmetry

in one of these equations. The non-resonant processes are highlighted by an energy level represented by a dotted line. The
denominators ∆(i), deﬁned in the text, correspond to doubly-resonant, singly-resonant and non-resonant processes.

operation. We can take advantage of this property to de-
compose the susceptibilities χ(e) in spherical tensors, as
each of them must be scalarly coupled to an equivalent
spherical tensor representing the polarization properties.
Each spherical tensor derived from χ(e,m,q)
is an irre-
ducible representation of the rotation group whose sym-
metry can be identiﬁed with that of a given multipole.
We can rewrite Eq. (A42) as:

Though there are several ways to couple three vectors
in irreducible components, Eq. (19) suggests the most
natural one: the symmetry of the i
β part implies that
only 6 out of 9 cartesian components contribute in this
coupling: they form a scalar tensor (T (0)) and a second-
rank spherical tensor (T (2)
In turn,
these two spherical tensors couple to the remaining out-
going polarization vector (cid:126)o. The coupling of the scalar

). The coupling of the second-rank spherical tensor
T (2)
m with the vector (cid:126)o leads to three spherical tensors:
˜O(1), ˜O(2) and ˜O(3) (as in the usual coupling of angular
momenta). The explicit expression for all these tensors
is given in Appendix A.3.

The case of χ(m) is less straightforward because of the
α with ((cid:126)i,o × (cid:126)ki,o)α and the associ-
substitution of i,o
ated symmetrization over all three terms, as reported
in Appendix A.3. However, mutatis mutandis, the or-
der parameters are in this case spherical tensors of rank
i =0, 1, 2, 3: ˜˜O(i).
In this case, more tensors of the
same order can appear, as detailed in Appendix A.3. Of
course, the ˜O(i) are all inversion-odd and the ˜˜O(i) are
all inversion-even. The former are associated with or-
der parameters with the symmetry of a toroidal dipole,
a magnetic quadrupole and a toroidal octupole (for the
time-reversal odd part) and with the symmetry of an
electric dipole, an axial toroidal quadrupole and an elec-
tric octupole (for the time-reversal even part). The latter
are associated with order parameters with the symmetry

magnetic toroidal quadrupole and a magnetic octupole
(for the time-reversal odd part) and with the symmetry
of an electric charge, an axial toroidal dipole, an electric
quadrupole and an axial toroidal octupole (for the time-
reversal even part). As stated above, we can just speak
of an order parameter ‘with the symmetry of’, because in
the optical regime, diﬀerently from the x-ray regime, all
involved states are band-like and the “order parameters”
are rather many-body correlation functions [26, 27].

In the following subsection, we specialize this analysis

to the magnetic symmetries of Sr2IrO4.

B. SHG symmetry analysis applied to Sr2IrO4

The magnetic space group of the − + +− state of
Sr2IrO4 associated with the I41/a crystal symmetry is
2/m1(cid:48) [38], as clear from Table II, when only the 4 equiv-
alent Ir atoms of the I41/a group are considered (e.g., Ir1,
Ir2, Ir5, Ir6). The behavior of the two tensors χ(e) and
χ(m) under the magnetic symmetry group 2/m1(cid:48) and sub-
groups is analyzed below, the aim being to ﬁnd out what
magnetic subgroups allow for both the interference with
the time-reversal even χ(q) signal of the non-magnetic
phase (found in Ref. 16) and the odd ψ-dependence seen
in the experimental data (Figs. 1 and 3 of Ref. 5). As
shown in Eq. (20) below, the key feature for having an
odd ψ-dependence is to have allowed cartesian tensors
with an even dependence on z (which means an odd de-
pendence on x and y, as both χ(e) and χ(m) are third-
rank cartesian tensors). This statement comes from the
following expressions for the electromagnetic ﬁeld (in =
incoming, frequency ω; out = outgoing, frequency 2ω; θ
is the angle between the outgoing beam and the c-axis;
ψ is the azimuthal angle around the c-axis, with ψ = 0
when the in-plane projection of the incoming wave-vector
is along the a-axis):

For the eight magnetic groups discussed below, those
allowing for a third-rank tensor with an odd ψ-
dependence can easily be picked out from Tables 4 and
7 of Birss [28]. For the time-odd case of interest, there
are only two possibilities: a polar tensor for 2(cid:48)/m (that
is, χ(e)) and an axial tensor for 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) (that is, χ(m)). For
the unlikely time-even case, there is only a polar tensor
for m1(cid:48) and an axial tensor for ¯11(cid:48).

To see this in more detail, we make use of the follow-
ing table for the symmetry behavior of the (cid:126)P and (cid:126)M
components under the 2/m1(cid:48) magnetic group:

From Table III, we can extract the allowed tensors for
2/m1(cid:48) and each of its subgroups. For 2/m1(cid:48), the to-
tal signal needs to be invariant under the sum over all
its symmetries. If the sum is calculated for each of the
above components, Pz, Px, Py, Mz, Mx, My, we get,
respectively, 0, 0, 0, 8i(cid:61)Mz, 0, 0. This result simply
expresses the fact that no matrix element for Pα is al-
lowed in the above group (as a consequence of inversion
symmetry that forbids matrix elements of polar vectors).
Therefore χ(e) is zero in 2/m1(cid:48). However, this is not the
case for the imaginary part of χ(m), time-reversal even,
because of the 8i(cid:61)Mz term. Such a term can interfere
with the χ(q) signal. However, the only components of
xxz, χ(m)
χ(m) that are diﬀerent from zero are χ(m)
yyz ,
and χ(m)
xyz . Therefore, from Eq. (20), this tensor is asso-
ciated with a 2ψ azimuthal dependence, in disagreement
with the experimental data. We can therefore disregard
such a magnetic group and look for all possible symmetry
reductions.

zzz , χ(m)

A cautionary note is necessary: in principle, we should
study the symmetry behavior of third-rank tensors with
27 cartesian components. We can simplify it and just
study the sum of each line of Table III as done above
for the following reasons: a) the square of all symme-
try operations of Table III is +1; b) the couples (Px,
Py) and (Mx, My) have the same behavior and c) the
products Px(y)Pz and Mx(y)Mz are always zero. Putting
all this together implies that studying the behavior of
symmetries AiBjCk (where A, B and C are any of P
symmetries Ck alone and
then ‘add’ the non-zero AiBj part only to the non-zero

(cid:80)
and M ) is the same as studying(cid:80)
(cid:80)

symmetries Ck-terms, as in the previous case.
Turning to subgroups of 2/m1(cid:48), we have 7 subgroups
with 4 symmetry elements, 2/m, 2(cid:48)/m, 2/m(cid:48), 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48), 21(cid:48),
m1(cid:48), 11(cid:48). We can repeat the above analysis for each sub-
group (keeping the order Pz, Px, Py, Mz, Mx, My) and
get:

• 2/m: The sum over the symmetry elements gives 0,
0, 0, 4Mz, 0, 0. No χ(e) is allowed. We have both
the real and imaginary parts of χ(m), but again,
as for the full 2/m1(cid:48) group, no odd dependence on
the azimuthal angle ψ. Therefore, this magnetic
subgroup is excluded.

• 2(cid:48)/m: The sum over the symmetry elements gives
0, 4i(cid:61)Px, 4i(cid:61)Py, 4i(cid:61)Mz, 0, 0. This implies a sig-
nal from the time-reversal odd part of χ(e) when
an odd number of x, y components is considered,
meaning an even number of z components. As cor-
rectly recognized in Ref. 5, this can explain the in-
terference with the χ(q) signal, being ψ-odd. The
χ(m) signal has the same behavior as for the 2/m1(cid:48)
group, a 2ψ-azimuthal dependence. Therefore it
is not responsible for the signal. We remark that
this magnetic symmetry is the one of the − + −+
pattern studied in the previous section. We shall
analyze this case more below.

• 2/m(cid:48): The sum over the symmetry elements gives
4i(cid:61)Pz, 0, 0, 4i(cid:61)Mz, 0, 0. Both χ(e) and χ(m) can
contribute, but none have the correct odd-ψ depen-
dence.

• 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48): The sum over the symmetry elements gives
0, 0, 0, 4i(cid:61)Mz, 4(cid:60)Mx, 4(cid:60)My. No χ(e) is al-
lowed and the imaginary, time-reversal even χ(m)
tensor has no odd-ψ terms. However, the real,
time-reversal odd χ(m) tensor has the desired odd-
ψ terms (e.g., χ(m)
zzx ) and it can interfere with the
imaginary part of χ(q) (through the damping fac-
tor iΓ). Its order parameter is either a magnetic
dipole or a magnetic octupole. Interestingly, this
magnetic group corresponds to the + + ++ state.
It is further discussed below.

• m1(cid:48): The sum over the symmetry elements gives
0, 4(cid:60)Px, 4(cid:60)Py, 4i(cid:61)Mz, 0, 0. The imaginary,
time-reversal even χ(m) tensor does not have odd-ψ
terms, because of the odd number of z components
and does not contribute to the signal. An odd-
ψ dependence for χ(e) is possible (even number of
z components), but only for its real, time-reversal
even part. Again, the real part of χ(e) can inter-
fere with the imaginary part of χ(q) because of the
damping factor iΓ. The order parameter associ-
ated with this magnetic group has the symmetry
of a time-reversal even electric polarization (or oc-
tupole). On the basis of the experimental evidence,
it appears as highly implausible that it determines
the SHG signal because such an order parameter
implies the displacement of atoms, so as to break
the global inversion, and this would be detectable
by other means. Moreover, the order parameter
is time-reversal even and should have contributed
also in the high-temperature phase, as no crystal
distortion is detected in passing from the high-
temperature phase to the low-temperature, mag-
netic phase. This is against the experimental evi-
dence.

• 21(cid:48): The sum over the symmetry elements gives
4(cid:60)Pz, 0, 0, 4i(cid:61)Mz, 0, 0. As for the 2/m(cid:48) group,
both χ(e) (real part, time-reversal even) and χ(m)

10

can contribute, but none have the correct odd-ψ
dependence.

• 11(cid:48): The sum over the symmetry elements gives 0,
0, 0, 4i(cid:61)Mz, 4i(cid:61)Mx, 4i(cid:61)My. No χ(e) is allowed.
The imaginary, time-reversal even χ(m) tensor is
allowed with an even number of z components and
can have the right odd-ψ dependence.
It can in-
terfere with the imaginary part of χ(q), but, as for
the m1(cid:48) group, it seems implausible since its asso-
ciated order parameter is time-reversal even (sym-
metry of an axial toroidal dipole or of an electric
quadrupole): either it should have been diﬀerent
from zero also in the high-temperature, tetrago-
nal phase, against the experimental evidence, or
it should be a secondary order-parameter, induced
by the ordered magnetic moments.
In the latter
case, however, magnetic moments should break the
2(cid:48) symmetry by tilting along the c-axis, against the
experimental evidence as well.

It is interesting to identify the allowed components
of the order parameters for the two space groups 2(cid:48)/m
and 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48). For the latter, the magnetic-dipole order pa-
rameter is the in-plane ferromagnetic component along
the b-axis, noting that the SHG signal is actually de-
termined by higher-order correlation functions with the
same symmetry (Appendix A.3) as opposed to those de-
termined from core-hole spectroscopies. For the 2(cid:48)/m
space group, the calculation of the toroidal dipole and
magnetic quadrupole is slightly more complex: we can
explicitly calculate their values, for the − + −+ pattern,
taking, respectively, the antisymmetric and the sym-
metric traceless parts of the following cartesian tensor:
. Here the sum is performed over
the 8 Ir atoms in the unit cell, r(n)
is the ith cartesian
component (i = x, y, z) at the nth Ir site of the posi-
tion vector and m(n)
the jth cartesian component of the
magnetic moment at the nth Ir site (here, we consider
magnetic patterns where mz = 0 for all sites). A di-
rect calculation using Table I shows that the only com-
ponents diﬀerent from zero for the − + −+ pattern are
the toroidal dipole Ωx (antisymmetric) and the magnetic
quadrupole Myz (symmetric, traceless). All other com-
ponents are zero. The absolute value of both Ωx and
2|m||c| sin φ, where |m| is the value of the mag-
Myz is 1
netic moment at the Ir sites, |c| is the value of the c-axis
length (25.804 ˚A) and φ ∼ 12◦ is the angle of the mag-
netic moment with the a-axis. Again, we remind that
the SHG signal is actually associated with higher-order
correlation functions with the same symmetry as Ωx and
Myz (Appendix A.3).

Some brief comments on the azimuthal dependence of
the experimental data are in order. The high tempera-
ture data originates from a χ(q) signal, since χ(e) is not
allowed and χ(m) does not have the correct angular de-
pendence [16, 28]. These data cannot be ﬁt by func-
tions of just 4/mmm symmetry [16]. In fact, the coeﬃ-

in RXS.

To summarize, the 2(cid:48)/m and 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) magnetic groups
are the only ones that can explain the SHG data with
time-reversal odd order parameters. Two other groups,
11(cid:48) and m1(cid:48), could have been compatible with the inter-
ference pattern, but are characterized by non-magnetic
order parameters that make them implausible. Both
2(cid:48)/m, corresponding to the − + −+ magnetic pattern,
and 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48), corresponding to the + + ++ magnetic pat-
tern, can therefore explain the experimental SHG data
without the need to invoke any exotic, higher-order, mul-
tipolar magnetic order or orbital currents.
However, we should explain how the −+−+ or ++++
magnetic patterns could replace the known − + +− pat-
tern of stoichiometric Sr2IrO4 in zero ﬁeld. As demon-
strated in Ref. 10, Ir replacement with Rh induces hole
doping at the Ir site (removing electrons from the ﬁlled
half of the Jeﬀ = 1/2 doublet). The laser beam employed
for the SHG experiment has the same eﬀect of promoting
a number of electrons from the ﬁlled Jeﬀ = 1/2 doublet
to empty states, thereby possibly inducing the onset of
the Rh-doped ground-state (either − + −+ or + + ++).
If we use an estimate for the number of photons per Ir
atom by linearly extrapolating a previous result (Fig. 3b
of Ref. 29) from the same group that did the SHG ex-
periment [5], for a laser ﬂuence of 1mJ/cm2 we get the
number of photons per iridium site around 10−2 to 10−1
[30], corresponding to the experimental window for Rh
doping of 1 to 10% where the − + −+ or + + ++ pat-
tern sets in [10–12]. But, this would require that this
metastable state be long-lived, since the repetition rate
for the laser was only 10 kHz, with a pulse width of 35
fs [5]. Such a metastable state could potentially have a
larger TN , which might counter the argument of Ref. 5
that the symmetry reduction in the SHG signal was at a
temperature higher than that associated with magnetic
order. Both could be checked by performing x-ray ex-
periments (see Section V) in the presence of the laser
ﬂuence.

To conclude this Section, we notice that our explana-
tion is at odds with the one suggested in Ref. 5, who
proposed that oxygen 2p states were excited by the laser.
This, however, is not consistent with the known band
structure from previous optical studies that indicate that
the 2p states are more than 3 eV below the Jeﬀ = 1/2
doublet [8]. As clear from Fig. 3, the ﬁrst absorbed pho-
ton has an energy around 1.55 eV and so the involved en-
ergy levels cannot lie lower than 1.55 eV below the Fermi
energy, arguing that all involved transitions are within
the 5d manifold of states. In this framework, a proba-
ble path for the SHG spectroscopy is an absorption from
the ﬁlled Jeﬀ = 3/2 to the empty Jeﬀ = 1/2 doublet, fol-
lowed by a subsequent absorption to the eg levels and the
ﬁnal decay to ﬁll again the Jeﬀ = 3/2 hole. Of course, in
order to allow for dipole transitions, hybridization of all
the former levels with magnetic density of states of the p
kind is necessary for both χ(e) and χ(m) transitions. As
shown in Section V by ab initio calculations, density of

functions as tabulated in Ref. 16. For (a), the curve is the
square of 0.91 − 0.42 sin(4ψ) − 1.69 sin2(2ψ). Note that the
smallest coeﬃcient is for the only allowed term in 4/mmm
(the rest only occur for 4/m). For (b), the curve is the

0.25 cos2(ψ) sin(ψ)− 0.11 cos(ψ) sin2(ψ) + 0.005 sin3(ψ). Note
the small changes in the ﬁrst three coeﬃcients relative to (a),
and the fact that the last four coeﬃcients indicate the signif-
icance of the octupole terms.

cients of the 4/m terms not in 4/mmm are larger than
the 4/mmm term, despite the weak nature of the 4/m
symmetry breaking (Fig. 4(a)). Similar observations ap-
ply as well to the third harmonic signal [16]. Whether
this is a real eﬀect, or due to other factors not taken into
account in the analysis, remains to be seen. In the low
temperature phase, where C4 symmetry is broken down
to C1 [5], we ﬁnd that dipole terms alone are not suﬃ-
cient to ﬁt the change in the azimuthal dependence (in SS
geometry, quadrupole terms do not enter, and the dipole
term goes as sin(ψ)). This means that octupole terms
play a signiﬁcant role (Fig. 4(b)), as often found as well

small, from hybridization of Ir 5d states with both Ir 6p
and O 2p states. Note also, that in the framework of
a resonant χ(m) transition, only the empty part of the
Jeﬀ = 1/2 doublet needs to hybridize with the p density
of states because, in the path (d1) of Fig. 3, the last M1
transition is characterized by ∆l = 0 (that is, Jeﬀ = 3/2
and eg levels can be even parity). We now turn to the
analysis of the ground state of Sr2IrO4, which we shall
use in Section V.

IV. KRAMERS DOUBLET GROUND STATE IN

Sr2IrO4

The breakthrough idea in the original paper of
B. J. Kim et al. [1] was the identiﬁcation of the ground
state of Sr2IrO4 as an octahedral Kramers doublet. As
shown in the last section, a proper knowledge of the
ground and the excited states of Sr2IrO4 are necessary,
in order to explain the SHG experiment. As a conse-
quence, we focus here on the theoretical description of
this Kramers doublet and on the experimental evidence
for its existence. We believe, in fact, that in spite of a
number of papers published on the subject [9, 17, 31, 33],
there are some experimental consequences of this state
that have not (or not correctly) been stated. As authors
in the iridate literature have sometimes followed diﬀerent
conventions for the deﬁnition of spherical orbitals, we list
our own deﬁnitions in Appendix B.

One of the key experimental evidences leading to the
octahedral Kramers doublet was the absence of mag-
netic RXS intensity at the Ir L2 edge for reﬂections that
showed a big resonant intensity at the L3 edge [9, 17].
This feature has been conﬁrmed in several other non-
stoichiometric compounds [17, 34, 35].
Initially inter-
preted as deﬁnitive evidence for this Kramers doublet
[9], the absence of a magnetic signal at the L2 edge was
considered as inconclusive, because an in-plane magnetic
moment could lead to the same conclusion [31] even if the
octahedral limit was not realized. However, the fact that
for some doped samples the magnetic moments point out
of the xy-plane and the magnetic RXS intensity at the
Ir L2 edge was still strongly depleted [34, 35] represent
yet another hint towards the physical realization of an
octahedral Kramers doublet. However, as this last men-
tioned experimental evidence referred to Ru-doped [35]
and Mn-doped [34] samples, it is still an open question
to ﬁnd deﬁnitive experimental evidence of the octahedral
Kramers doublet in Sr2IrO4.

We want to show here, by revisiting some of the cal-
culations, that direct experimental evidence for the re-
alization of this Kramers doublet in Sr2IrO4 is possible,
looking at the Ir L2 edge by X-ray absorption in partial
yield in such a way as to reduce the core-hole lifetime to
a value below 2 eV. The reason is due to the fact that two
low-lying empty states are present in the spectrum: the
empty partner of the Kramers doublet, within 1 eV of

12
the Fermi level, and the eg states (around ∼ 3 eV above
the Fermi level). The two cannot be identiﬁed in usual
XAS measurements, because of the L2 core-hole width of
around 5 eV. If an octahedral Kramers doublet existed,
this would be a pure j = 5/2 state (see Fig. 5 and cal-
culations below) and no dipole transition at the L2 edge
would be allowed. Therefore in this case, the ﬁrst, low ly-
ing peak would disappear and only the eg peak at higher
energies would be present, as eg states are a mixture of
both j = 5/2 and j = 3/2 states (Appendix B). Indeed,
a hint towards the presence of the two peaks was high-
lighted by Boseggia et al. [17], who noticed two bumps
in their magnetic spectra at the L2 edge. We think that
at least the higher energy peak corresponds to the eg
states that, though just slightly magnetically polarized,
can contribute to the magnetic intensity.

In what follows, we explain the details of our calcula-
tions. Note that as our main objective is to write down
the L2,3-edge cross-section, we shall not work with the
eﬀective angular momentum for the t2g states often em-
ployed in the literature, but with the real ones. We feel
that this representation is more transparent if we analyze
core-level transitions, as the expression of the Kramers
doublet in terms of the |j = 5
forms us about whether this transition is dipole-forbidden
or not at the L2 edge (we remind that dipole transi-
tions are characterized by ∆j = ±1 and therefore the
||j = 1/2(cid:105) core states of the L2 edge cannot be promoted
to |j = 5/2(cid:105) states above the Fermi level). This would
not be the case with |Jeﬀ = 1/2(cid:105).
In Appendix B, we
give the formulas to pass from one representation to the
other, in order to compare with the existing literature.

at an Ir site, as done several times in the literature [2, 36,
37], and as reported in detail in Appendix B, but then
express the solution in terms of the spin-orbit coupled
j = 5/2 and j = 3/2 states that can be associated with
the 5d electrons of Ir, we obtain:

the empty part of the Kramers doublet would be zero if

We can now evaluate the matrix elements that appear
in both magnetic RXS and XAS. The details are shown
in Appendix B.2. We draw here the conclusions of such
calculations, Eqs. (B8) and (B9). Where the L2 edge is
concerned, Eq. (B8) clearly shows that in the octahedral
limit, R(η = 0) = 1√
and all matrix elements are zero.
2
This is to be expected:
in this limit, the Kramers dou-
blet becomes a purely |j = 5/2(cid:105) state and no transition is
possible for the L2 edge. Eq. (B8) tells us also that when
the magnetic moment is in the ab-plane, whatever its ori-

OCF →SO5d5dOCF ←SOt2geg10Dqj = 3/2j = 5/2λSOKramers doubletλSO52entation, cos(2β) = 0 and oﬀ-diagonal elements are zero,
independent of R. This implies, in particular, that the
magnetic RXS signal is zero. We remind that this con-
clusion is valid because magnetic RXS is proportional to
the antisymmetric part of the L(2)
αβ tensor (Eq. (B8)) and
that the latter is an irreducible tensor of rank one: if it
is zero in one frame, it will be zero in any other rotated
frame. The opposite also is true, valid at the L3 edge,
Eq. (B9): if at least one component is non-zero in a given
frame, there will be at least one non-zero component in
any other rotated frame. This is suﬃcient to aﬃrm that
there is always a magnetic RXS signal at the L3 edge,
whatever R and β are (this rule, of course, does not con-
sider eventual extinctions due to the structure factor).
At the L3 edge, moreover, Eq. (B9) shows us that the
absorption coeﬃcient for the empty part of the Kramers
doublet is always diﬀerent from zero for any incoming
polarization (2R2 +
2R + 1 > 0, for any R) and for
any direction of the magnetic moment. We ﬁnally no-
tice that, contrary to what was stated in Ref. 33, the L2
edge magnetic RXS in the π− π channel is zero whatever
R is if the magnetic moment is conﬁned within the ab-
plane, as Eq. (B8) implies that no magnetic signal exists
in this case, in any frame (any incoming and outgoing
polarizations).

V. KEY EXPERIMENTS FOR Sr2IrO4

This Section is focused on the description of some key
experiments with the double aim to a) ﬁnd the ﬁnger-
print of the octahedral Kramers doublet in the stoichio-
metric material and b) highlight the presence of p states
just above the Fermi level in the magnetic space groups,
+ + ++ and − +−+, of interest for the SHG experiment
[5]. As explained in the previous Section, one key exper-
iment to conﬁrm whether the Jeﬀ = 1/2 doublet is real-
ized in Sr2IrO4 is to compare XAS experiments at the L2
and L3 edges of Ir, using the high-resolution capabilities
of partial ﬂuorescence detection to reduce the value of
the core-hole width at these edges. Typical values of the
core-hole width for Ir at the L2 and L3 edges are 5.69 eV
and 5.25 eV, respectively [42]. We remark in this respect
that, as depicted in Fig. 5, eg orbitals have both j = 3/2
and j = 5/2 character, as well as the Jeﬀ = 3/2 subman-
ifold of t2g [43]. This is evident by a simple inspection
of the transformation formulas given in Appendix B. In
the octahedral limit, the only purely j = 5/2 state is the
Kramers doublet Jeﬀ = 1/2. Therefore, dipole transi-
tions can reach the empty eg states but not the empty
partner of the Kramers doublet Jeﬀ = 1/2. This is not
the case for the L3 absorption transitions that can reach
both eg states and the empty partner of the Kramers
doublet. A comparison of the two high-resolution XAS
spectra could therefore provide a deﬁnitive conﬁrmation
of this issue for the stoichiometric compound.

In Fig. 6 we show the results of a numerical simula-
tion of L2-edge XAS by means of the FDMNES code

14

FIG. 6: (Color online) Ir L2 edge XAS for two diﬀerent core-
hole widths. The core-hole width of total ﬂuorescence yield,
Γ = 5.69 eV, does not allow one to separate the underlying
peak structure. The A-peak should be absent in the octahe-
dral limit. The − + +− state was assumed (the − + +− and
+ + ++ states give indistinguishable results at this scale).
The Fermi level sets the zero of the energy scale.

[44]. We remind that the FDMNES code is based on
a spin-polarized multiple-scattering approach including
spin-orbit akin to LSDA+SO (local spin density approx-
imation plus spin-orbit) calculations [45]. We performed
two XAS calculations, one with a core-hole width of 5.69
eV and the other with a core-hole width of 2 eV. We used
a cluster radius of 6.5 ˚A, containing 85 atoms [46]. With
Γ = 2.0 eV, the doublet structure of what appeared to
be a single peak for Γ = 5.69 eV clearly emerges. The
lower-lying structure, labelled as the A-peak in Fig. 6,
should not be there if the octahedral Kramers doublet
is realized (i.e., R = 1/
2). Its absence is a ﬁngerprint
of the octahedral Kramers doublet. Unfortunately, the
simulation does not reproduce all of the features of the
data: for example, the energy splitting of the eg 5d3z2−r2
and 5dx2−y2 states is underestimated (only ∼ 0.6 eV, as
compared to 1.6 eV experimentally [47]), though it would
take very high resolution to see this splitting in XAS.

√

We performed also the same calculation with a Hub-
bard U = 2 eV, but it did not change qualitatively the
results of Fig. 6, except for a shift of 0.5 eV of the higher-
energy shoulder to still higher energies (however, this dif-
ference would be diﬃcult to observe experimentally). We
remind that, as shown in the literature in the case of ac-
tinides, it is possible to select photons emitted from decay
channels characterized by longer lifetimes, i.e. a smaller
core-hole width, with resolutions of ∼2.0 eV at L edges,
or even down to 1.2 eV for the M2 edge in uranium com-
pounds [48]. These resolutions would clearly allow for
the detection of the presence or absence of the Jeﬀ = 1/2
peak at the L2 edge, thereby providing the ﬁnal word on

ting (cid:126) (cid:107) c and (cid:126)k (cid:107) a (black curve) makes XAS blind to
both the 5dx2−y2 and 5d3z2−r2 states and only sensitive
to the t2g 5dxz ones. This allows the identiﬁcation of the
lowest-lying peak, between 0 and 1 eV, as due to these
5dxz states. We remark that the E2 nature of this peak
is demonstrated by the diﬀerence with the purely E1 cal-
culation (red curve). Experimentally, such a feature can
be shown by rotating (cid:126)k. When we rotate the polarization
to the a direction and the wave-vector to the b direction
(both in-plane), E2 transitions become allowed for both
the 5dx2−y2 and 5d3z2−r2 states (the latter, because of
the x2 + y2 part contained in the r2 term). This is seen
by the green curve in Fig. 7. Finally, the dark-blue curve
with (cid:126) (cid:107) a and (cid:126)k (cid:107) c allows to double-check a) the E2
nature of the lowest-lying peak (because it is symmet-
ric in the a ↔ c exchange, as only E2 transitions are)
and b) the partly E1 nature of the features around 4 eV
(of course, the latter is evident also from the purely E1,
light-blue curve).

We remark also that a smooth extrapolation of the
E1 peaks around 14 eV shows that the Ir 6p density of
states is present down to the Fermi energy and, in cor-
respondence with the E2 features, further p density of
states, probably due as well to the hybridization of the Ir
5d and O 2p states. The possibility that this inversion-
odd density of states is magnetized, so as to be T I-
invariant, as required in the 2(cid:48)/m group suggested by the
SHG experiment, can be analyzed by non-reciprocal x-
ray linear dichroism or magnetochiral (XMχD) dichroism
[50, 51]. Such a technique would highlight the presence
of a toroidal, magnetic signal of E1-E2 origin, therefore
providing an independent conﬁrmation of the presence of
toroidal multipoles. By symmetry, this is only possible
for the − + −+ state. Unfortunately, as the inversion
breaking at the Ir sites is only determined by further
oxygen neighbors (see Section II), E1-E2 radial matrix
elements are extremely small, less than 10−4 of the E2-
E2 radial matrix elements leading to the XAS pre-edge
peak shown in Fig. 7. We have veriﬁed this by FDMNES,
where we ﬁnd an XMχD peak at the pre-edge for k par-
allel to the a-axis that is of order 10−4 of the L1 XAS
maximum (this requires a cluster radius of at least 7 ˚A).
The same order of magnitude applies to the K edge. This
implies that, were the toroidal nature of the SHG signal
conﬁrmed, SHG would be a much more sensitive tool to
detect a tiny ˆT ˆI-breaking order parameter than XAS.

In order to identify the actual magnetic state indi-
cated by the SHG experiment, a more sensitive tool than
XMχD is x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD),
whose signal is zero for the − + −+ and − + +− states
and non-zero for the + + ++ state. An XMCD signal
has been reported in Ref. 52 in the presence of a mag-
netic ﬁeld (therefore inducing the + + ++ state) with an
intensity about 1% of the XAS intensity [53].

Finally, the two magnetic space groups suggested by
the SHG experiment can be identiﬁed also by RXS ex-
periments at the L3 edge and at the L1 edge.

The experiment we suggest at the L3 edge was de-

FIG. 7: (Color online) Iridium L1 XAS, highlighting E2 tran-
sitions below 8 eV and the positions of the t2g and eg states
(see the main text for explanations). The − + −+ state was
assumed, and the Fermi level sets the zero of the energy scale.

the Kramers doublet is suggested by Eq. (B8). Here it
is shown that when XAS is measured with incoming po-
larization along z, one should get a null L2 signal for the
Kramers doublet, regardless of whether one is in the oc-
tahedral limit or not. That is, z polarization only picks
up the eg states. This would allow one to ﬁx experimen-
tally the energy level(s) of the eg states. If, starting from
this conﬁguration, we rotate the polarization towards,
say, the x-direction, any signal that develops at lower en-
ergies would necessarily imply that we are ﬁlling in the
unoccupied partner of the Kramers doublet and therefore
we are not in the octahedral limit. The results of Moon et
al. [8] at the O K edge and our simulations by FDMNES
at the Ir L1 edge, shown in Fig. 7, allow us to conﬁrm
that any signal of x character developed below the low-
est z peak cannot be of eg origin (e.g., 5dx2−y2 orbitals),
because the latter are higher in energy than the 5d3z2−r2
states. Here as well, the experiment would strongly rely
on a high resolution to resolve the three peaks.

Further independent pieces of information on the na-
ture of the low-lying energy states and their orbital dis-
tribution come from polarized XAS spectra at the Ir L1
edge, where it is possible to play with both incoming po-
larization and wave-vector through electric-quadrupole
(E2) transitions. The main results are shown in Fig. 7. In
particular, we show some results that would be measured
by high-resolution XAS (Γ ∼ 2 eV). The comparison with
the curves characterized by Γ = 8.3 eV (the typical core-
hole width for L1 XAS [42]) highlights the necessity for
high-resolution XAS. For all curves with Γ = 2.0 eV, the
E2 signal is clearly visible in the region up to 8 eV above
the Fermi energy (the zero of our energy scale). The
E2 origin of the signal is demonstrated by the diﬀerent
behavior of the black and red curves in the region from
0 to 4 eV, and the behavior of the green and light-blue
curves in the region from 0 to 8 eV. In particular, set-

explained by either the 2(cid:48)/m or the 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) magnetic space
groups. The former was already identiﬁed in Ref. 5 and
could be explained in terms of orbital currents. How-
ever, an order parameter with the symmetry of a toroidal
dipole is not suﬃcient to explain the azimuthal scan,
as noted in Section III. The octupole is needed as well.
Moreover, we have shown here that it is not necessary
to invoke exotic orbital currents to realize it: an induced
transition to the − + −+ state or to the + + ++ state
would have the same eﬀect. The latter was explicitly
excluded in Ref. 5, probably because only χ(e) was con-
sidered in that paper, not χ(m). Two other magnetic
space groups might explain the odd-ψ azimuthal depen-
dence of the interference signal found in Ref. 5: m1(cid:48) and
11(cid:48). The former was also identiﬁed in Ref. 5. However,
both of them are characterized by time-reversal even or-
der parameters, and it appears implausible that they play
a central role below the magnetic transition temperature.
2) From the calculations of Appendix B, we have high-
lighted a new experimental criterion, based on high-
energy resolution XAS, to identify the octahedral nature
of the Kramers doublet in stoichiometric Sr2IrO4. Such
an XAS measurement is independent of the direction of
the Ir magnetic moments (in-plane or out-of-plane), as it
only relies on the purely j = 5/2 nature of the Kramers
doublet in the octahedral limit.
It can provide, there-
fore, an independent conﬁrmation of the realization of the
octahedral Kramers doublet in the stoichiometric com-
pound.
3) We have suggested new experiments to highlight the
interplay of the three possible states, − + +−, + + ++,
or − + −+, of Sr2IrO4, that, though close in energy,
are characterized by diﬀerent magnetic space groups. In
particular, the − +−+ state has a magnetoelectric space
group and could explain the results of two papers, Ref. 5
and 7, that invoke the breaking of both spatial parity and
time-reversal symmetry.

scribed already in Section II and shown in Fig. 2. It has
the aim of identifying whether the − + −+ state or the
+ + ++ state is realized in Sr2IrO4 in the case of Rh
doping. Though challenging, it would be interesting to
perform these experiments under the inﬂuence of a laser
beam, so as to check whether the experimental conditions
of the SHG experiment in Ref. 5 could have induced a
phase transition from the − + +− state to the + + ++
or − + −+ states. We remind that a relatively small
applied magnetic ﬁeld (H (cid:39) 0.3 T) has been shown to
induce the + + ++ state [9]. In fact, it would be very in-
teresting to repeat the SHG experiments in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld that would induce the + + ++ state.
The RXS experiment at the L1 edge should be con-
ceived in such a way as to highlight, by interference,
the diﬀerence between the + + ++ and − + −+ states,
whose interference properties are diﬀerent, according to
Eqs. (5) and (6), for time-reversal odd observables. Un-
fortunately, in this energy range, as shown in Fig. 8, the
charge scattering dominates and this reduces the RXS
diﬀerences between the two states. The main diﬀerence
of the two can be found in the bigger decrease of the
(1,0,15) reﬂection of the − + −+ state just below the
resonance (Fig. 8). The E1 or E2 origin of the peaks
can be disentangled with the technique of phase plates
developed in Ref. 55.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

To conclude, we summarize here the main achieve-

ments of the present paper:

1) We have shown that the SHG experiment [5] can be

Wgf =

 ρf

where ρf is the density of the ﬁnal states and TI =
HI + HI GHT HI , with HI the matter-radiation inter-
action Hamiltonian and GHT = (Σg − HT + iΓ)−1
the Green’s function related to the total Hamiltonian
HT = H0 + HI . Σg is the total energy associated with
Φg. Here H0 is the sum of the matter Hamiltonian and
the radiation Hamiltonian, separately. With the usual
Dyson expansion GHT = GH0 + GH0 HI GH0 + ..., we
can replace in the above expression for TI and rewrite
Eq. (A1) up to any order in HI . The scattering cross-
section is obtained from the transition probability per
unit time by dividing by the incoming ﬂux (c/V for pho-
tons, when the vector potential is normalized to one pho-
ton per unit volume, V [24]). We can then pick out the
third order for the scattering cross-section, of interest
for SHG, σSHG = 2πVc ρf
, where the amplitude
reads (with Φf = Φg):

(A2)

We can now separate in HI the radiation part from
the matter part, as Σi = Ei + mω. Here Ei is the en-
ergy of the material alone (without radiation) for state
i and ω measures the photon energy associated with a
given matrix element. In particular, for SHG, m = 1 in
absorption and m = 2 in emission, because of the absorp-
tion of two photons of energy ω and the emission of one
photon of energy 2ω. Three diﬀerent terms are possi-
ble, as represented in Fig. 3, and they correspond to the
three processes: 1) absorption (ω) - absorption (ω) -
emission (2ω): this is a doubly resonant process; 2) ab-
sorption (ω) - emission (2ω) - absorption (ω): this is
a singly resonant process; 3) emission (2ω) - absorption
(ω) - absorption (ω): this is a non-resonant process.
Three diﬀerent energy denominators are associated with
each term, as shown below. For the interaction Hamil-
tonian, we suppose that we can perform a multipole ex-
pansion of the vector potential contained in HI [18] and
consider electric-dipole (E1), magnetic-dipole (M1) and
electric-quadrupole (E2) terms, only. With this hypoth-
esis, Eq. (A2) can be written as:

chosen to introduce the tensors η(e,m,q)
αβγ;ln (deﬁned below),
factorizing denominators explicitly because, as detailed
in Sections III and A.2, this factorization allows a clearer
identiﬁcation of the irreversible part, related to the de-
nominators, and of the transition matrix elements, re-
lated to the order parameters, where time-reversal can
be investigated.

αβγ must be considered.

For simplicity, we call χ(e) the tensors with three
electric-dipole transitions (E1-E1-E1), often called in
the optics community χ(eee), χ(m) the tensors with two
electric-dipole and one magnetic-dipole transition (E1-
E1-M1), often called χ(eem), and χ(q) the tensors with
two electric-dipole and one electric-quadrupole transition
(E1-E1-E2), often called χ(eeq). For symmetry reasons,
the M1 and E2 transitions can appear at any of the three
positions and this is the origin of the extra index i for

χ(m) and χ(q). It is pictorially shown in Fig. 3 for χ(m).

An important element of our analysis is the recognition
that, analogously to the case of RXS [18], each η(e,m,q)
tensor is characterized by a time-reversal odd and a time-
reversal even part, due to the matrix elements and inde-
pendent of the complex energy denominators. They can
be found by looking for the real and imaginary parts of
each tensor: η(e) = (cid:60)η(e) +i(cid:61)η(e), η(m) = (cid:60)η(m) +i(cid:61)η(m)
and η(q) = (cid:60)η(q)+i(cid:61)η(q). Notice that we did not consider
in our analysis the common imaginary unit multiplying
the E1-E1-E1 transition matrix elements in Eq. (A4). Of
course, we factorized it also in Eq. (A6) and Eq. (A15), so
that η(q) is always phase shifted by π/2 compared to η(e)
and η(m). We remark that this analysis corresponds to
Birss’ separation into i-tensors and c-tensors [28]. Start-
ing from Eq. (A42), we report the full expression only
for η(e) (in order not to overburden the notation, in the
following we remove the label (e), superﬂuous as we just
deal with η(e)):

We have also highlighted the order of appearance of in-
termediate states in the matrix elements through (glng),
which plays a fundamental role in the analysis. In fact,
the complex conjugate of ˜η(glng)
γβα : this implies
that we should not only reverse the order of the carte-
sian indices (which, alone, would have led to the antisym-
metrization of the γ and α labels), but also keep track
of the order of the intermediate states l, n (or n, l). The
latter point is what makes the profound diﬀerence, math-
ematically, with the RXS case, where the imaginary part
of the cartesian, third-rank tensor is antisymmetric in
two labels α and γ (see Ref. 25 for the analysis of the
analogous E1-E2 third-rank cartesian tensor in the case
of RXS) and therefore only couples with the correspond-
ing antisymmetric part of the polarization, leading to a
powerful selection rule based on time-reversal. In SHG
this is not possible, for this technical reason: (cid:61)˜η(glng)
is
not antisymmetric in α ↔ γ. Physically, this is related
to the order of the absorption and emission processes
(through the denominators ˜∆(i)
lng, which have no deﬁnite
symmetry in the exchange l ↔ n), that does not allow
time-reversal to be a symmetry of the SHG process, as it
is of RXS.

αβγ

In an analogous way, we can write similar expressions
also for χ(m) and χ(q) and deduce that (cid:60)˜η(e), (cid:61)˜η(m) and
(cid:61)˜η(q) are time-reversal even tensors (non-magnetic or i-
tensors in Birss’ notation [28]), whereas (cid:61)˜η(e), (cid:60)˜η(m)
and (cid:60)˜η(q) are time-reversal odd (magnetic or c-tensors
in Birss’ notation). These cartesian tensors can then be
analyzed in terms of the irreducible spherical decompo-
sitions, as shown in the next subsection and in Section
III.

In the light of our ﬁndings, it turns out that, of our
two candidates to explain the SHG signal, one (for the
2(cid:48)/m case) is the time-reversal odd part of η(e), which
is imaginary and therefore can interfere with the time-
reversal even part of η(q), which is imaginary as well. The
other (for the 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) case) is the time-reversal odd part
of η(m), which is real. Yet, it can still interfere with the
time-reversal even part of η(q), which is purely imaginary
only far from resonance. In fact, suﬃciently close to the
resonance (within ∼ Γ), the complex resonant denomina-
tors of the above SHG expressions for η(e), η(m) and η(q)
scramble the previous imaginary/real separation based
on the time-reversal properties of the matrix elements
in the numerator.
In fact, whatever is the numerator
N = a + ib (with a and b real), we get:

=

a + ib

(ωmi − 2ω + iΓm)(ωni − ω + iΓn)

+ b(Γn(ωmi − 2ω) + Γm(ωni − ω))]
+ i[−a(Γn(ωmi − 2ω) + Γm(ωni − ω))

=(cid:8)[a((ωmi − 2ω)(ωni − ω) − ΓmΓn)
+ b((ωmi − 2ω)(ωni − ω) − ΓmΓn)](cid:9)
(cid:8)((ωmi − 2ω)(ωni − ω) − ΓmΓn)2
+ (Γn(ωmi − 2ω) + Γm(ωni − ω))2(cid:9)−1

(A44)

one of the two extreme situations:

So, a and b matrix elements interfere, unless we are in
1) out of resonance (i.e., ωmi−2ω (cid:29) Γm and ωni−ω (cid:29)
Γn), so that Γ is negligible and a and b in Eq. (A44) do
not interfere any more;
2) in the case of a single, well separated resonance
(within ∼ Γ), exactly at resonance (i.e., ωmi − 2ω (cid:28) Γm
and ωni − ω (cid:28) Γn), so that the whole expression reduces
to − a+ib

, and again a and b do not interfere.

Identiﬁcation of the SHG order parameters

Here we give the explicit spherical and cartesian com-
ponents of some of the polarization tensors that couple
with the order parameters identiﬁed in Section III. We
ﬁrst list all the tensors of E1-E1-E1 origin (χ(e)), asso-
ciated with the 2(cid:48)/m magnetic group and then those of
E1-E1-M1 origin (χ(m)), associated with 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48). For χ(e),
we have that the polarization dependence is determined
by: a) two ﬁrst-rank tensors, ¯O(1) and ˜O(1), both coupled
to an order parameter with the symmetry of a toroidal
dipole, b) a second-rank ˜O(2), coupled to an order pa-
rameter with the symmetry of a magnetic quadrupole
and c) a third-rank ˜O(3), coupled to an order parame-
ter with the symmetry of a magnetic toroidal octupole.
Their explicit expression can be obtained from the scalar
product in Eq. (A42), that can be recoupled in spherical
˜O(i) · ˜χ(i). If,

Here,

for example, ˜Oyz couples to the correspond-
ing susceptibility ˜χyz, with the symmetry of a magnetic
quadrupole. Eqs. (A45) to (A48) allow us to associate
with each multipole component a well-determined az-
imuthal scan which constitutes a quantitative basis for
our statements in Section III. For example, using the
above equations with Eq. (20), we remark that ﬁrst-
rank tensors, with the symmetry of a toroidal dipole,
contribute to the SHG signal with just a sin ψ (cos ψ)
dependence. However, in order to explain the SHG az-
imuthal scans, sin3 ψ (cos3 ψ) terms are necessary. This
implies that, as noted in Section III, we cannot neglect
the signal determined by the magnetic toroidal octupole,
Eq. (A48). We remark also that the azimuthal-scan tech-
nique employed for SHG by Ref. 5 proves to be a very
powerful tool to extract the relative weight of each multi-
pole order parameter, in full analogy with the RXS case
[56, 57].
We can look at an analogous treatment of the χ(m)
terms of the 2(cid:48)/m(cid:48) group, though the algebra is slightly
more involved, given the number of terms to be treated in
the E1-E1-M1 case (see Fig. 3). Consider the case of the
E1-E1-M1 transition amplitude, A(m)
SHG, associated with
χ(m), in full analogy with what was done above for χ(e).
In this case, from Eq. (A3) we get:

In this way, we double the number of tensors that we

dence), ˘O(1) (a vector), and ˘O(2) (a symmetric traceless
second-rank tensor). These three tensors only contribute
in SP, PS and PP geometry, as in SS geometry (cid:126)o × (cid:126)i is
zero. This also implies that the scalar contribution is not
allowed in SS geometry for any of the E1-E1-M1 terms

this case, as stated above, there is no symmetry between
the two polarizations associated with the electric-dipole

γ. This implies that, besides the zeroth
and second-rank tensors, analogous to the previous case,
there is also the possibility of an antisymmetric coupling

Appendix B: Iridium ground state in a tetragonal

crystal ﬁeld

(A58)

In this Appendix, we list our own deﬁnitions for the
atomic-like ground state of Sr2IrO4, highlighting the dif-
ferences with other authors when needed. Notice that the

method that maps t2g orbitals to eﬀective p orbitals with
angular momentum Leﬀ = −1 is conceived to work within
the t2g subspace, so care must be taken when generalizing
to transition matrix elements involving other subspaces,
as in the case of the L2 and L3 edges. As our main objec-
tive is to write down the L2,3-edge cross-section, we shall
not work with the eﬀective angular momentum, but with
the real ones. Below, we give the formulas to pass from
one representation to the other, in order to compare with
the existing literature.

1. Basic equations for an Ir ion in a tetragonal

crystal ﬁeld

We deﬁne the ‘cartesian’ angular part of the 5d orbitals

in terms of spherical harmonics Y2m ≡ dm as follows:

d3z2−r2 = d0
√
dx2−y2 = (d2 + d−2)/
√
dxy = −i(d2 − d−2)/
√
dxz = −(d1 − d−1)/
√
dyz = i(d1 + d−1)/

2
2

2

2

From this, we get the inverse transformations as:

d0 = d3z2−r2
√
d1 = −(dxz + idyz)/
√
2
d−1 = (dxz − idyz)/
√
2
d2 = (dx2−y2 + idxy)/
√
2
d−2 = (dx2−y2 − idxy)/

2

Given its importance in the analysis of the L2 and L3
edges of Ir, we write down also the J = 5/2 and J = 3/2
states of the 5d electrons in terms of spherical harmonics
and spin functions (↑, ↓):

It should be reminded that a direct transition from the
L2 edge, characterized by J2p = 1/2, to the |j = 5
subspace is dipole forbidden. Therefore the decomposi-
tion of the half-ﬁlled Kramers doublet of Ir in Sr2IrO4 as
|j = 5
2 , jz(cid:105) states will directly inform us about whether
this transition is allowed or not at the L2 edge. In order
to do this, we write down the inverse formulas to get dm
states as a function of |j, jz(cid:105):

These expressions can be directly related to the ‘carte-
sian’ states (dxy, dxz, etc.) through the relations given
above. However,
it is more convenient to keep them
in this form and rather to express the Kramers doublet
(Eq. (B3)) in the spherical basis dm, as detailed below. It
should be noted in passing that Fig. 1(e) of Ref. 1 is some-
2 , jz(cid:105) atomic
what misleading in one aspect: the |j = 3
(spherical) states do not branch just to the t2g ones in
an octahedral environment (called Jeﬀ = 3/2 in that ﬁg-
ure), but to both t2g and eg. The same is true for the
|j = 5
2 , jz(cid:105) states. However, it is true that the Kramers
doublet in an octahedral crystal ﬁeld (i.e., Jeﬀ = 1/2,
in the absence of a tetragonal distortion), is entirely due
to the |j = 5
2 , jz(cid:105) states, as we shall see below. This is
expressed in Fig. 5.

As done in a number of publications on iridates [33],
and as detailed in Abragam and Bleaney [37], the Ir4+
state when restricted to the t2g subspace, and in the pres-
ence of a weak tetragonal crystal ﬁeld in the z direction,
can be determined by the following Hamiltonian:
H = λ(cid:126)L · (cid:126)S + ∆t(1 − L2
z)

(B2)

Here λ is the spin-orbit coupling and ∆t represents
the tetragonal distortion. But, to facilitate calculations
at the L2 and L3 edges, we consider this Hamiltonian
in the L = 2 basis instead of the Leﬀ = −1 basis. For
comparison with earlier work, we report below the rela-
tion between the two bases. Following Balhausen [58],
we deﬁne the eﬀective representation Leﬀ = −1 through
the three states φ1, φ0 and φ−1, corresponding to ef-
eﬀ = 1, 0,−1, respectively.
√
fective angular momentum Lz
They are deﬁned as: φ1 ≡ d−1 = (dxz − idyz)/
2, φ0 ≡
√
√
2 = idxy, φ−1 ≡ −d1 = (dxz + idyz)/
(d2 − d−2)/
√
2.
√
The inverse transformations are: dxz = (φ1 + φ−1)/
dxy = −iφ0, dyz = i(φ1 − φ−1)/

2,

2.

From the diagonalization of the previous Hamiltonian,
we ﬁnd three Kramers doublets [36], one bonding, one
non-bonding and one antibonding. For what follows, we
are interested only in the half-ﬁlled doublet that can be
written as follows:

where the coeﬃcients R(η) and N (η) depend solely on
the ratio η = ∆t/λ between the tetragonal crystal ﬁeld,
∆t, and the spin-orbit coupling, λ:

(cid:17)
2 (1 + 2η +(cid:112)9 − 4η + 4η2)

Notice that in the octahedral limit, η = 0, R(η = 0) = 1√

and N (η = 0) = 3
2 . In order to understand the behavior
at the L2 and L3 edges, it is instructive to rewrite this
Kramers doublet in terms of the |j, jz(cid:105) basis. This is done
in Eqs. (21) and (22) in Section IV. Here we report the
expressions of Eqs. (24) and (25) in the |j, jz(cid:105) basis:

In order to perform calculations at the L2 and L3 edges,
we move to a spherical basis, so that the Gaunt coeﬃ-

ten as:

for the L3 edge, reminding that α, β refer to any of the
three components x, y, z.
In order to clearly identify
the core-hole states j, jz with respect to the 5d j, jz of
Eq. (B1), we used a || convention for their bras and kets.
As the transition operator rα only changes the orbital an-
gular momentum, it is more convenient to rewrite ||j, jz(cid:105)
states in terms of their 2p orbital counterparts. We have:

Having all the coeﬃcients, the transition matrix el-
ements are now easily calculated after noting that the
spin is not changed in the transition (so, only equal-spin
states are coupled during the x-ray excitation), and given
the expressions for the only two Gaunt coeﬃcients that
appear in the calculation:
√
(cid:104)Y2m|Y1m1|Y1m2(cid:105) =

where (1, m1; 2, m2|1, m) represents the Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcient for the vector sum of (1, m1) and (2, m2) to
give (1, m). Notice that in the following, we shall drop
the radial matrix elements, |(cid:104)R2p(r)|r|R5d(r)(cid:105)|2, as they
are common to both the L2 and L3 edges, if we neglect
relativistic corrections. At L2, we obtain the following

Interestingly, as already highlighted after Eq. (22), we
get that in the octahedral limit, R(η = 0) = 1√
, all the
2
matrix elements at the L2 edge are zero, not just the
magnetic ones. In particular, the XAS signal should be
zero in this limit. Therefore, if an XAS signal is con-
ﬁrmed at the energy of this edge, this would show that
R deviates from 1√
, as discussed in Section IV. Notice
2
however that, diﬀerently from magnetic RXS, XAS can
also see the other empty states that are higher in en-
ergy, in particular the eg states, that are accessible from
the L2 edge because they have a sizable component in the
J = 3/2 subspace as seen above. Therefore, the XAS sig-
nal should be reanalyzed with a better energy sensitivity,
so as to clearly disentangle the unoccupied t2g states from
the eg ones, as discussed in Section V. If such a signal
is clearly detected at the edge itself, this is a deﬁnitive
proof that the half-ﬁlled Kramers doublet deviates sig-
niﬁcantly from the octahedral limit. If such a signal is
not detected, to the contrary, this is clear proof that the
doublet is composed purely of J = 5/2 states, as is the
case of |ψany(cid:105) above (Eq. (B4)) in the octahedral limit
(R(η = 0) = 1√
). In the latter case, this also implies the
2
absence of a signal in the magnetic RXS at the L2 edge.
In the former case, instead, absence of the magnetic sig-
nal at the L2 edge can also be explained by an in-plane
magnetic moment, that makes cos(2β) = 0, since the
magnetic signal originates from the oﬀ-diagonal matrix
element, xy. It should be noted, however, that this latter
case would not permit one to explain the lack of a RXS

We see that at least one oﬀ-diagonal matrix element al-
ways diﬀers from zero, whatever R and β are. This im-
plies that the magnetic RXS signal is always diﬀerent
from zero, as explained in Section IV.

2. The latter case
ab-plane, when cos(2β) = 0 or R =
corresponds to ∆t = λ, that we exclude for Sr2IrO4.
The former condition coincides with the one that makes
the L2 magnetic RXS zero (in keeping with Ref. 31 and

= cos(2β)

Ref. 33).

If we use the two partners of the Kramers doublet,
Eq. (25), it is straightforward to verify, using the usual
deﬁnitions for Lx = (L+ + L−)/2 and Ly = (L+ −
L−)/(2i), that the eigenstates of Lx and Sx correspond
to β = π/4 + kπ/2, with γ = 0 (positive x) or γ = π
(negative x) and that the eigenstates of Ly and Sy cor-
respond to β = π/4 + kπ/2, with γ = π/2 (positive y) or
γ = 3π/2 (negative y).

Finally, using Lx = (L+ + L−)/2 and Ly = (L+ −
L−)/(2i) and analogously for the spins Sx and Sy, it is
possible to show that the condition (cid:104)Mx(cid:105)any = (cid:104)My(cid:105)any
implies γ = π/4 (modulo nπ).

[19] Sometimes, a signal is also seen when h and k in the
reﬂection are inverted. This is due to the AF moments
aligning along b rather than a (noting that the high tem-
perature phase is tetragonal). For a large beam size (like
neutrons), both twin domains are often seen.

[21] Order of magnitude wise, χ(e) is bigger than χ(q) and
χ(m) by a factor λ/a (here λ is the wavelength and a is
a typical interatomic space). This, however, is true for
its real, time-reversal even part, not for the imaginary,
magnetic part. The latter, deﬁned in Appendix A, can
be comparable to χ(m), as calculated in Ref. 22. This is
further conﬁrmed in the present case if the interference
with χ(q), which is of the same order as χ(m), turns out
to be determined by χ(e).

[38] In this subsection we use the notation 1(cid:48) for time reversal
and 1 for spatial inversion, in order to compare more
easily with Ref. 5.

[39] As clear from the choice of t2g orbitals, the x, y and z
axes are directed towards the surrounding oxygens. The
angle γ is deﬁned in this basis. Of course, because of the
-33◦ rotation of the x-axis of the octahedron compared
to the a-axis, the magnetic moment at Ir1 is oriented 12◦
to the a-axis.

[40] The origin of the error can be traced back to Eqs. (1.29)
and (1.32) of Ref. 41, where only the spin magnetic mo-
ment is turned from the c-quantization axis of Eq. (23) to
the a-axis. The orbital moment should have been turned
as well, leading to Eq. (24) with β = π/4 and γ = π/4.

[53] Concerning the interpretation of the XMCD at the L2
edge advanced in Ref. 52, suggesting a zero contribu-
tion for all energies for the purely octahedral Jeﬀ = 1/2
Kramers empty partner, we notice that it is apparently
based on the incorrect assumption that the eg states to-
tally belong to the j = 5/2 manifold. This assumption
can be traced back to Fig. 1 of Ref. 54. Our Eq. (B1)
shows instead that eg states have a sizable j = 3/2 con-
tribution and this can lead to an XMCD signal at the L2
edge by spin polarization of the eg states. Therefore, the
XMCD detected around the energy of the eg states [52]
does not contradict the main message of Section IV.
