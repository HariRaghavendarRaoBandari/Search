We study spontaneous dimerization transitions in a Heisenberg spin-1 chain with additional next-
nearest neighbor (NNN) and 3-site interactions using extensive numerical simulations and a confor-
mal ﬁeld theory analysis. We show that the transition can be second order in the WZW SU(2)2 or
Ising universality class, or ﬁrst-order. We argue that these features are generic because of a marginal
operator in the WZW SU(2)2 model, and because of two topologically distinct non-dimerized phases
with or without edge states. We also provide explicit numerical evidence of conformal towers of sin-
glets inside the spin gap at the Ising transition. Implications for other models are brieﬂy discussed.

Topological matter is currently attracting a lot of at-
tention. One of the ﬁrst examples is the spin-1 Heisen-
berg chain, which has a bulk gap1 but spin-1/2 edge
states.2,3 Spin-1 chains with more general interactions
have been extensively studied over the years, and they
have in particular been shown to undergo a spontaneous
dimerization in the presence of a negative biquadratic
interaction at an integrable critical point.4,5 The univer-
sality class of this critical point is SU(2)2 Wess-Zumino-
Witten (WZW) with central charge c = 3/2.6–8 It has
been identiﬁed in other models exhibiting spontaneous
dimerization,9 and it is usually considered to describe
the generic behaviour of spin-1 chains at the transition
to a spontaneously dimerized phases.

In this Letter, we identify two other generic possibili-
ties, Ising and ﬁrst order, and we show that these alter-
natives are natural consequences of general properties:
i) the presence of topological and non-topological phases
with and without edge states respectively; ii) the exis-
tence of a marginal operator in the WZW SU(2)2 model.
We also show that combining density matrix renormal-
ization group (DMRG) simulations with conformal ﬁeld
theory (CFT) predictions for open systems gives access to
the conformal towers of the critical lines, including that
of singlets inside the spin gap on the Ising line.

We consider the spin-1 chain Hamiltonian:

(J1Si · Si+1 + J2Si−1 · Si+1)

On top of the standard Heisenberg coupling J1, it in-
cludes two of the three interactions that appear in next-
to-leading order in the strong coupling expansion of the
two-band Hubbard model: the NNN interaction J2 and
a three-site interaction with coupling strength J3. (The
biquadratic interaction (Si · Si+1)2 has been omitted for
simplicity.) We set J1 = 1 throughout the paper and
concentrate on the case J2, J3 ≥ 0.

Let us ﬁrst summarize the main results obtained using
extensive DMRG simulations and exact diagonalizations
(ED). The phase diagram as a function of J2 and J3 con-
sists of three phases, each of which may be schematically

Figure 1. (Color online) Phase diagram of the spin-1 chain
with next-nearest neighbor coupling J2 and 3-site interaction
J3. The transition from the dimerized phase to the Haldane
phase is continuous along the solid line, with central charge
c = 3/2, and ﬁrst order along the dashed line. The transi-
tion from the NNN-Haldane to the dimerized is a continuous
transition in the Ising universality class with central charge
c = 1/2. The transition between the Haldane phase and the
NNN-Haldane phase is always ﬁrst order.

illustrated by a diagram with lines indicating valence
bond singlets formed between various site, (see Fig. 1):
a Haldane phase with one valence bond per J1 bond,
a next-nearest neighbor (NNN)-Haldane phase with one
valence-bond per J2 bond, and a dimerized phase with
two valence-bonds on every other J1 bond. The charac-
terization of the short-range correlations (including dis-
order and Lifshitz lines) will be reported elsewhere.10

The transition between the Haldane and the NNN Hal-
dane phase is always ﬁrst order (the energy per site has
a kink), in agreement with previous results for J3 = 0.11
It is topological: the two phases cannot be distinguished
by any local order parameter, but the Haldane phase
is topological (supports gapless edge states), while the
NNN-Haldane is not (see sketches in Fig. 1).

For small J2, the transition between the Haldane and
Dimerized phases is in the SU(2)2 WZW universality

0.1119 up to (and including at) a critical end point be-
yond which the transition becomes ﬁrst order (see be-
low). There is actually a simple argument in favor of
a ﬁrst order transition in this parameter range: The
fully dimerized state is an exact ground state at J2 =
0, J3 = 1/6,9 and it remains an exact eigenstate along
the line J2 + 3J3 = 1/2,12 but it is not the ground state
at J2 = 1/2, J3 = 0. So a ﬁrst-order transition where
the dimerization disappears abruptly has to take place.
This ﬁrst-order line connects smoothly, at an unusual
triple point, with the ﬁrst-order transition between the
Haldane and NNN Haldane phases.10

Finally, the transition between the NNN Haldane and
Dimerized phases is in the Ising universality class. As
shown in Fig. 2, singlet excitations become critical and
build a conformal tower while the magnetic excitations
remain gapped at the transition. Note that we have
reached similar conclusions regarding the phase transi-
tions for the spin-1 chain with NNN and biquadratic
interactions,10 in partial disagreement with Pixley et
al13, who in particular reached the conclusion that the
transition between the NNN Haldane and Dimerized
phase is ﬁrst order.

This phase diagram and the nature of the various tran-
sitions can be understood using conformal ﬁeld theory
(CFT) techniques. We begin near the SU (2)2 critical
point where the low energy degrees of freedom of the spin
chain can be written in terms of an SU (2) matrix ﬁeld,
g(x, t). The staggered component of the spin operators
become (cid:126)Sj ∝ (−1)jtr(cid:126)σg(j) and the dimerisation opera-
tor becomes (cid:126)Sj · (cid:126)Sj+1 ∝ (−1)jtrg(j). The low energy
eﬀective Hamiltonian is that of the SU (2)2 WZW model
together with one relevant and one marginal operator,

H = HW ZW + λ1(trg)2 + λ2 (cid:126)JR · (cid:126)JL,

(2)
where (cid:126)JL/R are the left (right) moving spin currents.
The relevant coupling constant, λ1, controls the Haldane
to Dimerized transition. When λ1 < 0, (cid:104)trg(cid:105) becomes
non-zero corresponding to dimerisation.8 When λ1 > 0
(cid:104)trg(cid:105) = 0 corresponding to the Haldane phase. The
marginal coupling constant, λ2, renormalises to zero if it
is initially negative. In this regime the Haldane to Dimer-
ized transition is second order, with the WZW model
occurring along the critical line with logarithmic correc-
tions to scaling. These logarithmic corrections vanish at
the end of the critical line, where λ2 = 0.14 When λ2 > 0
it renormalises to large values.

To understand the full phase diagram, it is very useful
to use a conformal embedding (also called a coset con-
struction), an exact representation of the SU (2)2 WZW
model as a direct product of a free boson and an Ising
model.15 All operators in the WZW model can be repre-
sented as products of free boson and Ising operators. In
particular:16

coeﬃcient of  in the Ising Hamiltonian corresponds to
the disordered phase whereas a negative coeﬃcient to the
ordered phase with (cid:104)σ(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0. Thus we obtain, from Eq.
(3), (cid:104)trg(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0 for λ1 < 0. Remarkably, in this representa-
tion of the WZW model, a second order transition occurs
simultaneously in Ising and boson sectors. The ﬁrst or-
der transition for λ2 > 0 can be understood intuitively
in this representation. A large positive λ2 favours states
with (cid:104)(cid:105)(cid:104)cos
4πθ(cid:105) < 0. There are then two degenerate
gapped states with (cid:104)(cid:105) < 0, θ pinned at 0 corresponding
to the Haldane phase or (cid:104)(cid:105) > 0, θ pinned at ±√

So, far we have focussed on the vicinity of the WZW

we move far from it along the ﬁrst order transition line.

It is now no longer permissible to only consider the cou-
plings which are relevant at the critical point so the Ising
√
and boson transitions could occur at diﬀerent places in
4πθ term
the phase diagram. For instance, a λ3 cos 3
π/2 depend-
ing on its sign.
If λ3 changed sign along a line in the
phase diagram the transition could occur in the boson
tor. This phase with (cid:104)θ(cid:105) = ±√
sector without occurring simultaneously in the Ising sec-
π/2, (cid:104)σ(cid:105) = 0 corresponds
to the NNN Haldane phase. This can be seen from the
presence of gapless S=1/2 edge excitations when (cid:104)θ(cid:105) = 0
but not when (cid:104)θ(cid:105) = ±√
π/2. An open boundary favors
a dimer ending at the last site. Hence (cid:104)trg(x)(cid:105) becomes
non-zero near the boundary. Thus (cid:104)θ(x)(cid:105) takes the value
±√
π/2 at an open end16 and (cid:104)σ(x)(cid:105) becomes non-zero.
However, (cid:104)θ(x)(cid:105) = 0 far from the boundary in the Hal-
dane phase. This rotation of θ(x) corresponds to an in-
duced magnetisation:

NNN Haldane phase since (cid:104)θ(x)(cid:105) = ±√

near an open boundary at x = 0 in the Haldane phase.
By contrast, there is no induced magnetization in the
π/2 in the bulk,
so it doesn’t rotate at the boundary. So this phase has
no gapless edge modes but also has no dimerisation since
(cid:104)σ(cid:105) = 0. Thus, we may identify it with the NNN Hal-
take place in which θ remains pinned at ±√
dane phase. We now see that a third transition can also
π/2 while
the sign of the  term in the Hamiltonian changes. This
corresponds to an Ising transition from NNN Haldane to
Dimerized phases. The gap in the boson sector, at this
transition, implies a gap for all magnetic excitations.16

Let us now use CFT to extract more precise informa-
tion about the phase diagram, beginning with the Ising
transition. As discussed above, an open boundary con-
dition favors dimerisation, corresponding to a non-zero
boundary magnetic ﬁeld in the Ising model.
It then
follows from boundary CFT that the magnetization at
the critical point decays away from the boundary as17
(cid:104)σ(x)(cid:105) ∝ 1/x1/8 since 1/8 is the scaling dimension of
σ. For a ﬁnite system of N sites, a conformal transfor-
mation gives (cid:104)σ(x)(cid:105) ∝ 1/[(N/π) sin(πx/N )]1/8. On a ﬁ-
nite chain, we deﬁne the local dimerization as D(j, N ) =
|(cid:104)(cid:126)Sj.(cid:126)Sj+1(cid:105) − (cid:104)(cid:126)Sj−1.(cid:126)Sj(cid:105)|. Identifying the local dimeriza-
tion with σ, this leads to D(j, N ) ∝ 1/[N sin(πj/N )]1/8,
and in particular to D(N/2, N ) ∝ 1/N 1/8. Plotting
D(N/2, N ) versus N on a log-log plot, we determine the
Ising critical line by the points where this curve is linear.
We ﬁnd the slope is close to 1/8 along the entire Ising crit-
ical line. An example of data on a line crossing the Ising
critical line is shown in Fig. 3 (a). Along the critical line
we also ﬁnd a good ﬁt of D(j, N ) to 1/[N sin(πj/N )]1/8
as shown in Fig. 3 (b).

CFT predicts that all excitation energies,

for any
conformally invariant boundary conditions, are of the
form (πv/N )xn where v is the velocity and the dimen-
sionless numbers xn are universal scaling dimensions of

operators.18 Furthermore, the ground state energy con-
tains a universal term −πvc/(24N ) for open boundary
conditions (OBC) and −πvc/(6N ) for periodic bound-
ary conditions (PBC) where c is the central charge. We
identify OBC with ↑,↑ boundary conditions in the Ising
model for N even and ↑,↓ boundary conditions for N odd,
where the arrows refer to the directions of the boundary
magnetic ﬁelds. This follows because OBC favour the
same sign of the dimerisation at both ends of the system
for N even but opposite signs for N odd. Similarly we
identify PBC on the spin chain with PBC on the Ising
model for N even but anti-periodic boundary conditions
on the Ising model for N odd. We have calculated the
ground state energies in all 4 cases and the lowest 4 ex-
cited state energies for OBC and both parities of N ; see
Fig. 2. Note that, in stark contrast to the singlet sector,
the singlet-triplet gaps in Fig. 2c and 2d go to a non-zero

mines ten xn parameters. The nine parameters extracted
from OBC all agree to within 5% with the conformal ﬁeld

the nature of the domain walls between the phases (see
Fig. 4). A domain wall between Haldane and Dimerized
phases necessarily carries spin-1/2 because the Haldane
phase is topological and has edge states, leading to a
transition with magnetic excitations (WZW SU(2)2 if it
is continuous), whereas a domain wall between NNN-
Haldane and Dimerized phases does not because the
NNN-Haldane phase is topologically trivial with no edge
states, leading to an Ising transition in the singlet sector
with gapped magnetic excitations. These observations
are consistent with the ﬁeld theory approach. At a do-

The alternative between Ising and SU(2)2 universal-
ity classes has been ﬁrst pointed out by Nersesyan and
Tsvelik in the related context of spin-1/2 ladders with
four-spin interactions using a Majorana fermion repre-
sentation of the ﬁeld theory.20,21 Calculations on spe-
ciﬁc models with ring-exchange or frustrated leg coupling
have supported this prediction.22–34 In that respect, the
main diﬀerence with our model is that, in the model of
Nersesyan and Tsvelik, one goes from Ising to SU(2)2
through a trivial point of decoupled chains32,34 and cen-
tral charge c = 2, with no indication of an end-point
of the SU(2)2 line followed by a ﬁrst-order transition, a
generic feature of our approach due to the presence of a
marginal operator.

Coming back to the role of edge states at the tran-
sition, the result summarized in Fig. 4 can easily be
extended to ladders to explain the fundamental diﬀer-
ence between Ising and SU(2)2 universality classes: spon-
taneous dimerization transitions between phases which
are both topologically trivial (rung singlet and columnar
dimer) or non trivial (Haldane and staggered dimer) can
be expected to be generically Ising because edge states
are absent or compensate each other, while spontaneous
dimerization transitions between a topological and a non-
topological phase (staggered dimer and rung singlet or
Haldane and columnar dimer) must include magnetic ex-
citations because of the edge states and can be expected
to be generically SU(2)2, or possibly ﬁrst-order with spin-
1/2 solitons. Similar ideas might be extended to transi-
tions between valence-bond solids and dimerized phases
in other contexts, possibly in higher dimension.

theory (CFT) predictions for the Ising model (see Table
I in [16]). The agreement is not as good for PBC because
the sizes accessible to DMRG are much smaller. We plot
the excited states energies in the upper panels of Fig. 2c
and 2d. The expected conformal tower structure of ex-
cited states is clearly revealed.16 Note that the extraction
of the central charge from the entanglement entropy for
PBC and OBC using the Calabrese-Cardy formula19 is
tricky because of the presence of strong oscillations,16 but
the results are also consistent with c = 1/2.

As stated above, the end point of the WZW SU(2)2 is
characterized by the absence of logarithmic corrections.
So this is the only point along the line where the crit-
ical exponents can be accurately extracted from ﬁnite
sizes. For the SU (2)2 model, CFT predicts D(j, N ) ∝
1/[(N/π) sin(πx/N )]3/8. The ‘apparent’ exponent de-
creases from (cid:39) 0.43 for J2 = 0 until it reaches 3/8 at
J2 (cid:39) 0.12 (see Fig. 3(c)). As a conﬁrmation, we have
also extracted the conformal towers at that point, for
OBC with N even or odd, and they ﬁt well to the WZW
SU(2)2 prediction.16 Along the critical line, the central
charge remains equal to 3/2, including at the end point.
The fact that it only drops around J2 = 0.2 is presumably
a ﬁnite size eﬀect: since the gap is due to a marginal op-
erator, it increases exponentially slowly above J2 = 0.12
and cannot be seen on small systems.

To summarize, the spontaneous dimerization transi-
tion in spin-1 chains can be WZW SU(2)2, Ising, or
ﬁrst-order depending on the parameters. What is the
rationale behind this unexpectedly rich situation? The
ﬁrst observation is that the WZW SU(2)2 model has a
marginal operator, and in such a situation, the transition
can be expected to turn ﬁrst order if its coupling con-
stant changes sign. Regarding the alternative between
Ising and WZW SU(2)2, if the transition is continuous,
we would like to suggest that it is intimately related to

Appendix B: Finite Size Spectrum

There are 3 conformal towers that can occur in the ﬁ-
nite size spectrum (FSS) of the Ising model, labeled by
the corresponding primary ﬁelds, I,  and σ, with dimen-
sions 0, 1/2 and 1/16 respectively. The ﬁnite size spec-
trum of the Ising model with the four diﬀerent boundary
conditions discussed in this paper were all worked out
by Cardy.18 With PBC and anti-periodic boundary con-
ditions, direct products of conformal towers in left and

states in the spectrum, for all 4 boundary conditions are
given in Table I and compared to our DMRG results.

For the SU (2)2 WZW model there are 3 conformal
towers labeled by the spin of the lowest energy states,
j = 0, 1/2 and 1. Finite size spectra with conformally
invariant boundary boundary conditions at both ends
of the system can be determined from the correspond-

to the |0(cid:105) boundary state at both ends of the system and
the corresponding conformal tower in the FSS is j = 0.
Going to an odd number of sites is formally analogous
to the infrared ﬁxed point spectrum of a spin-1 Kondo
model and the corresponding boundary state changes to
|1(cid:105) at one end of the system.37 The resulting FSS con-
tains the j = 1 conformal tower. Thus the ground state
energies of an open chain with an even or odd number of
sites are:

In order to build the conformal tower at the end point
J2 = 0.12 and J3 = 0.087, we calculate the gap between
the ground state energy and the lowest energies in dif-
ferent sectors of Stot
z . The gap scales linearly with 1/N
and the slope gives access to the velocity. By calculating
excited states in the sectors Stot
z = 0, 1, we could deter-
mine the multiplicity of two lowest energy levels.
In a
chain with an even number of sites, the ground state is a
singlet and the ﬁrst excited state is a triplet, while for a
chain with an odd number of sites, the ground state is a
triplet and the ﬁrst excited state is degenerate and con-
sists of one triplet and one singlet, in complete agreement
with CFT predictions. The DMRG data on the scaling
is presented in Fig.5 a) and b) and summarised in Table
II.

We checked that the conformal tower is destroyed by
moving along the critical line away from the end point.
To demonstrate this, we have plotted the velocities ex-
tracted from three diﬀerent excitation levels n (ﬁg.6). At
the end point, all velocities are expected be the same, im-
plying that the conformal tower is restored. This occurs

ity of this phase transition the convergence of the entan-
glement entropy in DMRG algorithm is very slow. This
results in big oscillations that appear on top of the curve
given by Eq. C1. In principle these oscillations can be re-
moved by increasing the number of sweeps and the num-
ber of states kept in DMRG. We went up to 16 sweeps
keeping up to 900 states in two-site DMRG. With these
parameters, oscillations disappear only for chains smaller
than 30 sites. For larger systems, we have extracted the
central charge for lower and upper curves of the entangle-
ment entropy separately, as shown in Fig. 7a). Note that
the ﬁnite-size corrections to Eq.C1 are minimal when the
block sizevn is as far as possible from the extreme values
1 and N 38. Therefore we discard a few points close to the
edges while ﬁtting. Alternatively, one can estimate the
ﬁnite-size central charge by calculating it in the middle
of the curve with only two points (see sketches with dia-
monds in Fig. 7a)). Using Eq. C1 leads to the estimates:

where k = 0, 1 for upper and lower curves.

For each system size, we then extrapolate the extracted
values of the central charges with the number of states
kept in DMRG algorithm. The extrapolated values of
the central charge as a function of system size N are
shown in Fig. 9. They are consistent with c = 1/2 in the
thermodynamic limit.

It is well established that DMRG algorithm has better
performances for open systems, and much bigger system
sizes can be reached then. In systems with open bound-
ary conditions, the entanglement entropy scales with the
block size according to:

entropy at the Ising transition

For a periodic chain with N sites, the entanglement
entropy of a subsystem of size n is deﬁned by SN (n) =
−Trρn ln ρn, where ρn is the reduced density matrix. Ac-
cording to conformal ﬁeld theory, the entanglement en-
tropy in periodic systems depends on the size of the block

As in the case of periodic boundary conditions, big os-
cillations appear on top of the prediction of Eq. C3.
However, in open systems, the oscillations are caused by
Friedel oscillations and cannot be removed by increasing
the number of sweeps or the number of states. Separate
ﬁts of the upper and lower curves of the entanglement
entropy leads to rough estimates of the central charge:
clower ≈ 0.41 and cupper ≈ 0.63 (see Fig. 8a)).

In order to remove the oscillations, following Ref. [39],
we have subtracted the spin-spin correlation on the corre-
sponding link from the entanglement entropy with some
weight ζ. Then the reduced entanglement entropy as a

function of the conformal distance takes the form:

The results of the numerical calculation of the central
charge from the entanglement entropy for both OBC and
PBC are summarized in Fig 9. These results are consis-
tent with c = 1/2.

Appendix D: Convergence of energies in DMRG

Close to the critical point, the DMRG algorithm con-
verges very slowly, especially for periodic boundary con-
ditions. In Fig. 10a), we have plotted the ground-state
energy of periodic chains as a function of the inverse num-
ber of sweeps. Note that we plot measurements after

responds to going back and forth. So the variable sweep
takes half-integer as well as integer values. The almost
ﬂat part of the curves for large number of sweeps indi-
cates that convergence was reached. For each curve, we
have used the slope of the last few points to extrapolate
the results for inﬁnite number of sweeps. We do up to 16
sweeps and keep up to 900 states. In the ﬁrst 6-7 sweeps
the number of kept states increases from 100 to approxi-
mately 90% of the maximal value, in the following sweeps

we jiggle the wave-function by decreasing and increasing
the number of states until the convergence is reached.

The lack of convergence is also a problem for higher ex-
cited states even with open boundary conditions as shown
in Fig. 10b). To estimate the excitation energies, we have
extrapolated the last few points of each curve to inﬁnite
number of sweeps with a linear ﬁt in 1/sweep. We do
7-9 sweeps and the number of kept states increase lin-
early from 100 to 900. Therefore ﬁnite-size scaling of the
energy with the number of sweeps is equivalent to scaling
with number of kept states.
