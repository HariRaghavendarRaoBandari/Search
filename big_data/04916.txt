Abstract

For a positive integer r and a vertex v of a graph G, let I (r)

G (v) denote the set
of all independent sets of G that have exactly r elements and contain v. Hurlbert
and Kamat conjectured that for any r and any tree T , there exists a leaf z of T
such that |I (r)
T (z)| for each vertex v of T . They proved the conjecture
for r ≤ 4. For any k ≥ 3, we construct a tree Tk that has a vertex x such that x is
not a leaf of Tk, |I (r)
(x)| for any leaf z of Tk and any 5 ≤ r ≤ 2k + 1,
and 2k + 1 is the largest integer s for which I (s)
Tk
conjecture is not true for r ≥ 5.

(x) is non-empty. Therefore, the

1 Introduction

We shall use small letters such as x to denote non-negative integers or elements of a set,
capital letters such as X to denote sets or graphs, and calligraphic letters such as F to
denote families (that is, sets whose members are sets themselves). The set {1, 2, . . . }
of positive integers is denoted by N. For any m, n ∈ N, the set {i ∈ N : m ≤ i ≤ n}
is denoted by [m, n], and we abbreviate [1, n] to [n]. For a set X, the family {A ⊆

X : |A| = r} of all r-element subsets of X is denoted by (cid:0)X

of subsets of X, then the family {F ∈ F : x ∈ F } is denoted by F (x) and is called a
star of F . All arbitrary sets are assumed to be ﬁnite.

r(cid:1). If x ∈ X and F is a family

A graph G is a pair (X, Y ), where X is a set, called the vertex set of G, and Y is a

subset of (cid:0)X

2(cid:1) and is called the edge set of G. The vertex set of G and the edge set of

G are denoted by V (G) and E(G), respectively. An element of V (G) is called a vertex
of G, and an element of E(G) is called an edge of G. We may represent an edge {v, w}
by vw. A vertex v of G is a leaf of G if there exists exactly one vertex w of G such that
vw ∈ E(G).

If H is a graph such that V (H) ⊆ V (G) and E(H) ⊆ E(G), then we say that G

contains H.

If n ≥ 2 and v1, v2, . . . , vn are the distinct vertices of a graph G with E(G) =

{vivi+1 : i ∈ [n − 1]}, then G is called a (v1, vn)-path or simply a path.

A graph G is a tree if |V (G)| ≥ 2 and G contains exactly one (v, w)-path for every

v, w ∈ V (G) with v 6= w.

Let G be a graph. A subset I of V (G) is an independent set of G if vw /∈ E(G) for
every v, w ∈ I. Let I (r)
G denote the family of all independent sets of G of size r. An
independent set J of G is maximal if J * I for each independent set I of G such that
I 6= J. The size of a smallest maximal independent set of G is denoted by µ(G).

Hurlbert and Kamat [8] conjectured that for any r ≥ 1 and any tree T , there exists

a leaf z of T such that I (r)

T (z) is a star of I (r)

T of maximum size.

Conjecture 1.1 ([8, Conjecture 1.25]) For any r ≥ 1 and any tree T , there exists a
leaf z of T such that |I (r)

T (z)| for each v ∈ V (T ).

T (v)| ≤ |I (r)

Hurlbert and Kamat [8] also showed that the conjecture is true for r ≤ 4. In the next
section, we show that the conjecture is not true for r ≥ 5. For any k ≥ 3, we construct
a tree Tk that has a vertex x such that x is not a leaf of Tk, |I (r)
Tk (x)| for any
leaf z of Tk and any r ∈ [5, 2k + 1], and 2k + 1 is the largest integer s for which I (s)
Tk (x)
is non-empty.

Tk (z)| < |I (r)

G is a star of I (r)

Conjecture 1.1 was motivated by a problem of Holroyd and Talbot [5, 7]. A family
A is intersecting if every two sets in A intersect. We say that I (r)
G has the star property
if at least one of the largest intersecting subfamilies of I (r)
G . Holroyd
and Talbot introduced the problem of determining whether I (r)
G has the star property
for a given graph G and an integer r ≥ 1. The Holroyd–Talbot (HT) Conjecture [7,
Conjecture 7] claims that I (r)
G has the star property if µ(G) ≥ 2r. By the classical
Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem [4], the HT Conjecture is true if G has no edges. The HT
Conjecture has been veriﬁed for certain graphs [2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. It is also veriﬁed in
[1] for any graph G with µ(G) suﬃciently large depending on r; this is the only result
known for the case where G is a tree that is not a path (the problem for paths is solved
in [6]), apart from the fact that I (r)
G may not have the star property for certain values
of r (indeed, if G is the tree ({0} ∪ [n], {{0, i} : i ∈ [n]}) and 2 ≤ n/2 < r < n, then
I (r)
G = (cid:0)[n]
star property lies in determining a largest star. Our counterexample to Conjecture 1.1
indicates that the problem for trees is more diﬃcult than is hoped.

r (cid:1) is intersecting). One of the diﬃculties in trying to establish the

r (cid:1) and (cid:0)[n]

2 The counterexample

Let x0 = 0, x1 = 1 and x2 = 2. For any k ∈ N, let yi = 2 + i for each i ∈ [2k], let
zi = 2k + 2 + i for each i ∈ [2k], and let Tk be the graph whose vertex set is

{x0, x1, x2} ∪ {yi : i ∈ [2k]} ∪ {zi : i ∈ [2k]}

and whose edge set is

{x0x1, x0x2} ∪ {x1yi : i ∈ [k]} ∪ {x2yi : i ∈ [k + 1, 2k]} ∪ {yizi : i ∈ [2k]}.

Theorem 2.1 Let k ∈ N.
(a) The graph Tk is a tree, and the leaves of Tk are z1, . . . , z2k.
(b) The largest integer s such that I (s)
(c) If k ≥ 3, then |I (r)

Tk (x0) 6= ∅ is 2k + 1.

Tk (z)| < |I (r)

Tk (x0)| for any leaf z of Tk and any r ∈ [5, 2k + 1].

Proof. (a) is straightforward.

Let G = Tk. Let Y = {yi : i ∈ [2k]} and Z = {zi : i ∈ [2k]}.
We have {x0} ∪ Z ∈ I (2k+1)
(cid:0)Y ∪Z
s−1(cid:1) and |(S\{x0}) ∩ {yi, zi}| ≤ 1 for each i ∈ [2k]. Thus s − 1 ≤ 2k, and hence
Suppose k ≥ 3 and r ∈ [5, 2k + 1]. Let J = I (r)

(x0). Suppose that S is a set in I (s)

G . Let E = {I ∈ J : x0, z1 ∈ I}. Let

G (x0). Then S\{x0} ∈

s ≤ 2k + 1. Hence (b).

G

A1 = {I ∈ J (x0) : y1 ∈ I},
A2 = {I ∈ J (x0) : y1, z1 /∈ I},
B1 = {I ∈ J (z1) : x0 /∈ I, x1 ∈ I, x2 /∈ I},
B2 = {I ∈ J (z1) : x0 /∈ I, x1 /∈ I, x2 ∈ I},
B3 = {I ∈ J (z1) : x0 /∈ I, x1, x2 ∈ I},
B4 = {I ∈ J (z1) : x0, x1, x2 /∈ I}.

We have J (x0) = E ∪ A1 ∪ A2 and J (z1) = E ∪ B1 ∪ B2 ∪ B3 ∪ B4. Since y1z1 ∈ E(G),
{y1, z1} * I for each I ∈ J . Thus E, A1 and A2 are pairwise disjoint, and hence

Since E, B1, B2, B3 and B4 are pairwise disjoint,

|J (x0)| = |E| + |A1| + |A2|.

|J (z1)| = |E| + |B1| + |B2| + |B3| + |B4|.

(1)

(2)

Let Y ′ = Y \{y1} and Z ′ = Z\{z1}. Since x0x1, x0x2 ∈ E(G), we have {x0, x1},

{x0, x2} * I for each I ∈ J . Thus {A\{x0} : A ∈ A2} = I (r−1)
B4}, and hence

1| > |B′

Since a > 0, |A′

2| = |B2|
and |B′
3| = |B3|. Thus |A1| > |B1| + |B2| + |B3|. By (1), (2) and (3), it follows that
|J (x0)| > |J (z1)|. Clearly, for each i ∈ [2k], we have |J (zi)| = |J (z1)|, and hence
|J (zi)| < |J (x0)|. By (a), (c) follows.

2| + |B′

If I is a maximal independent set of Tk, then |I ∩{x0, x1, x2}| ≥ 1 and |I ∩{yi, zi}| = 1
for each i ∈ [2k]. Thus µ(Tk) = 2k + 1. Therefore, if 5 ≤ r ≤ (2k + 1)/2, then the
condition µ(Tk) ≥ 2r of the HT Conjecture is satisﬁed, but, by Theorem 2.1, no leaf of
Tk yields a star of I (r)

Tk of maximum size.
