Abstract.
Accurate measurements of magnetic and velocity ﬁelds in and around
solar active regions are key to unlocking the mysteries of the formation and the decay
of sunspots. High spatial resolution image and spectral sequences with a high cadence
obtained with the GREGOR solar telescope give us an opportunity to scrutinize 3-D
ﬂow ﬁelds with local correlation tracking and imaging spectroscopy. We present GRE-
GOR early science data acquired in 2014 July – August with the GREGOR Fabry-Pérot
Interferometer and the Blue Imaging Channel. Time-series of blue continuum (λ 450.6
nm) images of the small active region NOAA 12118 were restored with the speckle
masking technique to derive horizontal proper motions and to track the evolution of
morphological changes. In addition, high-resolution observations are discussed in the
context of synoptic data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory.

Introduction

With new instruments and improved observing facilities we can enhance our under-
standing of plasma motions surrounding sunspots and their interaction with magnetic
ﬁelds. Current developments in the magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations (e.g.,

1

2

Rempel & Cheung 2014) provide the complete evolution of an active region from ﬂux
emergence to decay, allowing direct comparison with these high-resolution observa-
tions. In the growing phase, penumbra form rapidly around the sunspot (Leka & Sku-
manich 1998; Yang et al. 2003). The appearance of penumbrae is closely linked to
inclined magnetic ﬁeld lines and the onset of the Evershed ﬂow. During the growth of
the penumbra the umbral size seems to remain stable according to Schlichenmaier et al.
(2010). It is common that the growth of sunspots is faster than the decay (e.g., Verma
et al. 2012). The stable leading sunspots and irregular trailing spots decay with diﬀer-
ent rates (Martínez Pillet 2002). Many decay laws have been proposed ranging from a
linear decay rate of Bumba (1963) to a parabolic decay law described by Petrovay &
van Driel-Gesztelyi (1997).

Figure 1.
Bipolar active region NOAA 12118 observed in a blue continuum
image of GREGOR/BIC on 2014 July 18. The image was rotated to match the
orientation of the region in SDO images.

The ﬂow structure around sunspots and active region plays signiﬁcant role in both
growth and decay processes. Magnetic ﬂux from the sunspot is removed via the in-
teraction of penumbral ﬁlaments and the surrounding granulation (Kubo et al. 2008).
Unipolar moving magnetic features (e.g., Hagenaar & Shine 2005), which are usu-
ally observed around decaying sunspots (Harvey & Harvey 1973) and pores (Verma
et al. 2012), are supposed to transport ﬂux to surrounding supergranular cell bound-
aries. Hence, detailed knowledge of ﬂow ﬁelds in and around solar magnetic features
at various evolutionary stages is expected to provide insight into the growth and decay
processes of sunspots. In this work based on GREGOR data, we present the horizontal
proper motions around an active region, which is in its growth phase with continuous
ﬂux emergence.

2. Observations and data reduction

In July – August 2014 we had carried out a 50-day-long “early science” campaign at the
1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope (Denker et al. 2012; Schmidt et al. 2012), which
resulted in 30 days of observations with the Blue Imaging Channel (BIC) and the GRE-
GOR Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (GFPI, Denker et al. 2010; Puschmann et al. 2012).

3

Here, we present time-series of blue continuum (λ 450.6 nm) images of the bipolar
active region NOAA 12118 observed on 2014 July 18 starting at 07:56 UT. The four
time-series of 30 min each were observed with 60 image sequences containing 80 im-
ages each with an exposure time of 4 ms. The images have a size of 2160×2672 pixels
with an image scale of 0.035 ′′ pixel−1. The resulting ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of 75′′ × 93′′
fully contains the active region. The blue continuum images were reconstructed using
the Kiepenheuer Institute Speckle Interferometry Package (KISIP, Wöger et al. 2008;
Wöger & von der Lühe 2008). Figure 1 shows an image from the blue continuum
time-series. A region-of-interest (ROI) was extracted from the image and rotated to
remove the image rotation introduced by the altitude-azimuth mount of the GREGOR
telescope.

Active region NOAA 12118 as observed in a SDO/HMI LOS magne-

We complemented GREGOR observations with the synoptic observations from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO, Scherrer et al. 2012). SDO’s Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI, Schou et al. 2012; Couvidat et al. 2012; Wachter et al. 2012)
provided line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms and continuum images covering the entire
evolution of the active region, i.e., from its emergence to decay. The time-cadence of
45 s allowed us to use a time-series of LOS magnetograms for computing horizontal
proper motions. Apart from basic calibration steps, magnetograms were corrected for
geometrical foreshortening, after which a pixel represented 360 km on the solar surface.
Figure 2 shows one of the magnetograms. The 40 Mm × 80 Mm ROI was extracted
from the full-disk magnetogram.

Active region NOAA 12118 appeared on the solar disk on 2014 July 17 around
15:00 UT. By the time of the GREGOR observations the region was approaching its
maximum growth. However, the central part of the region was still a site for continuous
ﬂux emergence. The region was bipolar and categorized as an αβ-group. The negative-
polarity leading and positive-polarity trailing parts were both conglomerations of pores,
which never developed penumbrae. The region started to decay on 2014 July 19. Atyp-
ically, the leading pore decayed ﬁrst (Bumba 1963), and the region had signiﬁcantly
decayed by 2014 July 22.

Detailed view of horizontal proper motions around the leading part of
the active region computed using LCT (left) and DAVE (right). The coordinates refer
to Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. In these images one arcsec corresponds to 0.78 Mm.
The color ﬁgure can be found in the electronic version.

Horizontal proper motions using GREGOR continuum images were computed
with the Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) code of Verma & Denker (2011). The code
was adapted for high-resolution data. Images were aligned and the signature of ﬁve-
minute oscillations was removed. Cross-correlations were computed over 48 × 48-pixel
image tiles with a Gaussian kernel having a FWHM = 1200 km, corresponding to the
typical size of a granule. The time cadence was ∆t = 60 s, and the ﬂow maps were
averaged over ∆T = 30 min. Corresponding to GREGOR data we chose a 2-hour
time-series of LOS magnetograms starting at 08:00 UT applying the Diﬀerential Aﬃne
Velocity Estimator (DAVE, Schuck 2005, 2006) to calculate the horizontal plasma ve-
locities. We computed horizontal proper motions for all four time-series. However,
considering the scope of this conference contribution we present preliminary results
only for the second time-series, i.e., the 30-minute time-series starting 08:36 UT.

3. Results

To infer the proper motions in continuum images and magnetograms we used LCT and
DAVE, respectively. These methods were applied to the full FOV. However, here we
focus only on the leading pore of the active region (Fig. 3).

The observed active region was bipolar, with leading negative polarity.

In the
DAVE map (right-panel Fig. 3) there are strong outward motions along the border of
the dominant pore. Inside the pores the horizontal velocities are lower and uniform.
However, at coordinates (45 Mm, 22.5 Mm) in a region with mixed polarity the proper
motion is multidirectional. At coordinates (47.5 Mm, 35 Mm) weak swirling motion is
visible. The maximum DAVE velocity in the ROI reached up to 0.4 km s−1.

The LCT map provides horizontal proper motions by tracking on photospheric fea-
tures in continuum images. In the 30-minute averaged map of 30′′ × 30′′, we see high
velocities in the surroundings of the pore giving an impression of moat ﬂow. However,
as already mentioned, none of the pores in the active region developed a penumbra, i.e.,

5

no Evershed ﬂow can develop. In addition, many small scale diverging centers are visi-
ble, e.g., at coordinates (2′′, 20′′) and (14′′, 29′′). The LCT method tracks photospheric
contrast features (granules, penumbral ﬁlaments, umbral dots, etc.) and does not per se
rely on the presence of magnetic ﬁelds as in the case of DAVE. The maximum veloci-
ties achieved in the LCT map reach up to 0.7 km s−1. Already visual inspection clearly
reveals diﬀerences in velocities computed by DAVE and LCT. This discrepancy points
to diﬀerences in the underlying physics used in both methods, but also the disparate
spatial resolution has to be considered.

LCT velocities (top) and divergence (bottom) for one of the rapidly
expanding granules marked by white circle over the period of 30 minutes. The FOV
is 14′′× 14′′. The rainbow-colored averaged LCT vectors are superposed on the 10-
minute average continuum images of GREGOR, which capture the evolution of the
rapidly expanding granule. Red colors represents divergence and blue corresponds
to convergence. Divergence maps are scaled between ±5 ×10−2 s−1. The color ﬁgure
can be found in the electronic version.

The high spatial and temporal resolution of the GREGOR data allows us to follow
horizontal proper motions of small-scale features such as rapidly expanding granules.
In this active region, we see many granules which are larger and more elongated than
normal granules. These rapidly expanding granules could be the signature of continu-
ous ﬂux emergence. One example of these expanding granules is shown in Fig. 4. We
show an ROI of 14′′× 14′′centered on the granule. The horizontal ﬂow maps are aver-
aged over 10 min, and the background is the corresponding averaged blue continuum
image. The center of the granule has a positive divergence from the start (as seen in the
ﬁrst panel of Fig. 4), which becomes highest in the next 10 minutes, while in the last
10 minutes it decreases. The LCT velocity vectors traced the full areal extent of the
rapidly expanding granules.

4. Conclusion

The GREGOR high-resolution images and SDO LOS magnetograms furnished infor-
mation about the evolution of horizontal ﬂow ﬁelds around NOAA 12118. In the LCT
and DAVE ﬂow maps outward ﬂows along the border of the leading pore were present.
In addition, LCT captured the diverging proper motions of rapidly expanding gran-
ules. The presence of these granules in the region can be related to continuous ﬂux
emergence. In the future, the combination of spectropolarimetric observations of the
GFPI and the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS, Collados et al. 2012) along with
high-resolution imaging will provide the opportunity to follow changes in ﬂows as well
as magnetic ﬁelds. The multi-wavelength and multi-instrument setup is necessary to
understand the complex process of spot formation and decay.
