A theoretical rate constant for the associative detachment reaction Rb(2S)+OH−(1Σ+)→ RbOH(1Σ+)+ e−
of 4×10−10cm3s−1 at 300 K has been calculated. This result agrees with the experimental rate constant of
2+2−1 × 10−10cm3s−1 obtained by Deiglmayr et al. (Phys. Rev. A 86, 2012) for a temperature between 200
K and 600 K. A Langevin-based dynamics which depends on the crossing point between the anion (RbOH−)
and neutral (RbOH) potential energy surfaces has been used. The calculation were performed using the
ECP28MDF eﬀective core potential to describe the rubidium atom at the CCSD(T) level of theory and
extended basis sets. The eﬀect of ECPs and basis set on the height of the crossing point, and hence the rate
constant, has been investigated. The temperature dependence of the latter is also discussed. Preliminary work
on the potential energy surface for the excited reaction channel Rb(2P)+OH−(1Σ+) calculated at the CASSF-
icMRCI level of theory is shown. We qualitatively discuss the charge transfer and associative detachment
reactions arising from this excited entrance channel.

INTRODUCTION

The last decade has been the subject of numerous ad-
vances in the study of the dynamics of cold atoms and
molecules, leading to the opening of new avenues in var-
ious branches of physics and chemistry1–3. The appli-
cations range from precision spectroscopy4 to quantum
control of chemical reactions5. New research ﬁelds have
been developed in order to control and cool atomic and
molecular species, allowing the possibility to investigate
their interactions at low temperature. Depending on the
experimental method, the translational, rotational, vi-
brational or hyperﬁne energy can correspond to temper-
atures below 1 K. Neutral and ionic atoms can now be
routinely trapped and laser-cooled to the micro Kelvin
regime3. A broad range of methods such as laser cool-
ing, Stark deceleration, radio-frequency trap (rf trap),
buﬀer gas or sympathetic cooling have been developed to
cool and/or trap molecular species. Molecular ions can
be trapped using an rf trap6 which allows subsequent
cooling by collision with cold gas or with laser cooled
atoms. The former method, using standard cryostats, is
limited to temperatures above 4 K7 whereas in the lat-
ter, translational temperature down to a few millikelvins
can be reached using laser cooled atomic ions3. The use
of neutral atoms, implying the collision of much closer
encounters should result in the cooling of internal de-
grees of freedom, therefore reducing the population of
high rotational and vibrational states of the molecular
ion. Such a scheme, called an hybrid atom-ion trap, con-
sists of an rf-trap superimposed with a magneto optical
trap (MOT)8. In such an environment, elastic, inelastic
and reactive collisions can take place, leading to a loss of
ions if the kinetic energy release exceeds the depth of the

a)Electronic mail: milakas@ulb.ac.be

trap or if the ions lose their charge. The co-trapping of
Rb and OH− has been the subject of several theoretical
studies9–13 and is currently under experimental investi-
gation by the HAItrap group in the university of Heidel-
berg from which the ﬁrst results have been published14.
This system is of particular interest since the dynam-
ics of anions, specially at low temperature, can exhibit
non-standard behaviour15. Moreover, quantum chem-
istry calculations involving anions have also proven to
be challenging16.
In the co-trapping experiment14 of Rb and OH−, a
loss of OH− has been observed and attributed to the
associative detachment reaction Rb(2S)+OH−(1Σ+) →
RbOH(1Σ+) + e−, and a translational temperature of
200-600 K has been estimated for OH−. The ﬁrst theoret-
ical result was obtained by Byrd et al.9 using a Langevin
model based on the calculated crossing point between
the anion and neutral potential energy surfaces (PES).
They showed that the associative detachment reaction
can only occur when higher excited vibrational states
of OH− are taken into account. However, the presence
of vibrational excited OH− in the trap is very unlikely.
In fact, the vibrational frequency of OH− is 3556 cm−1
(0.44 eV)17, which corresponds to an equivalent temper-
ature energy (E=kbT) of 5116 K. At 300 K the popula-
tion ratio of the ﬁrst vibrational excited state (v=1) is
about 4×10−8, which is negligible. One could argue that
the OH− molecules are produced in a plasma discharge,
which is known to produce vibrational hot species16.
However, the vibriationally excited OH− should quickly
(about ten ms9) decay to their vibrational ground state
by spontaneous emission. Moreover, the OH− molecules
are thermalized by collision with argon atoms at room
temperature before being trapped14. The trapped OH−
molecules should therefore be in their vibrational ground
state when colliding with the Rb atoms.
Since the optical cycle used in the MOT involves ru-
bidium in its ﬁrst excited electronic state 2P (2P3/2

when taking into account the ﬁne structure), reactions
from the excited entrance channel Rb(2P)+OH−(1Σ+)
are also interesting to study and could lead to some un-
usual eﬀects18.
The present paper is structured as follows:
in section
II we start by deﬁning the diﬀerent symmetry correla-
tions for the RbOH and RbOH− systems. In section III
we recalculate a portion of the potential energy surface
(PES) of the RbOH and RbOH− species using three dif-
ferent eﬀective core potentials (ECP) for the rubidium
atom. The crossing point between the anion and neu-
tral curve, corresponding to the autodetachment region,
has been obtained from the best PES. We recalculate the
rate constant for the associative detachment reaction us-
ing the model suggested by Byrd et al. and the results
of the newest ECP. In the last part of the paper (section
IV), we investigate the excited reaction channel.

II. SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS

The ground state of RbOH− is deﬁned by the 2Σ+
in the linear C∞v symmetry which be-
term symbol
comes 2A0
in the nonlinear case (Cs point group).
This molecular state correlates to the dissociative chan-
nel Rb(2S)+OH− (1Σ+), both products being in their
ground states. The ground state of the neutral RbOH
molecular species is deﬁned by the 1Σ+ term symbol in
C∞v and 1A0 in Cs symmetry. This state is correlated
to the covalent Rb(2S)+OH(2Π) dissociation channel for
bent geometries and to the ionic Rb+(1S)+OH−(1Σ+)
dissociation channel at linear geometry19.
The ﬁrst electronic excited state of Rb is a 2P state,
which correlates with the 1Σ+ ground state of OH− to
form a 2Σ+ and a 2Π excited molecular states at lin-
ear geometry. At bent geometry these states split into
two 2A00 and one 2A0 states. For the sake of complete-
ness we also have to take into account the charge trans-
fer channel Rb−(1S)+OH(2Π) which lies around 0.24
eV below the Rb(2P)+OH−(1Σ+) channel (see section
IV) and lead to the 1 2Π molecular state (which be-
comes 2 2A0 + 1 2A00 at bent geometries). These Wigner-
Witmer correlations for the anion along with those for
the neutral RbOH molecular specie are summarized in
Table I. The energies of the diﬀerent channels are given
relative to Rb(2S)+OH−(1Σ+).
It should be pointed
out that several other dissociation limits are located be-
tween the Rb(2S)+OH(2Π) and Rb+(1S)+OH−(1Σ+)
channels9 but are not accessible in the energy range con-
sidered here. A schematic overview of the potential en-
ergy curves (PEC) at linear and bent geometry for the
diﬀerent states appearing in Table I is shown in Figure 1.
The curves have been obtained from separate MRCI cal-
culations for the neutral and anionic system and shifted
to match the experimental energies at dissociation and
are therefore only shown for a better understanding of
the diﬀerent states of interest.

III. COLLISION WITH GROUND STATE RUBIDIUM:
ASSOCIATVE DETACHMENT

A. Computational method

All calculations were performed on the Hydra and
Vega clusters of the ULB/VUB using the MOLPRO 2012
package23. Jacobi coordinates have been used to de-
scribe the geometry of the Rb-OH system. RRb is the
distance between the Rb atom and the center of mass
of the OH molecule, ROH is the interatomic distance
between O and H and θ deﬁnes the angle between the
RRb and ROH vectors (see Figure 2). Accordingly, the
geometry for θ = 0◦ corresponds to the case where
the Rb-O-H atoms are aligned whereas θ = 180◦ cor-
responds to the O-H-Rb collinear conﬁguration. The po-
tential energy surfaces have been calculated at the cou-

turbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) as implemented
in the MOLPRO program24. The unrestricted variant
has been used for open-shell cases25,26. The augmented
correlation-consistent valence quintuple zeta basis set
aug-cc-pV5Z (shortened AV5Z)27 was used for the oxy-
gen and hydrogen atoms. We have used three diﬀerent
approaches to describe the rubidium atom. The ﬁrst one
follows the work of Byrd et al. where the Wood-Boring
eﬀective core potential ECP28MWB (here after abbre-
viated MWB)28 was used along with the corresponding
sp functions augmented by spdf functions from the def2-
QZVPP basis set29,30 (shortened defQZ). The ﬁnal num-
ber of contracted functions in the basis is [12s9p4d3f ]. In
the second approach we used the more recent Dirac-Fock
ECP28MDF (here after abbreviated MDF) eﬀective core
potential with the corresponding segmented spdfg valence
basis set31 which contains (13s10p5d3f 1g) functions con-
tracted to [8s7p5d3f 1g]. Both eﬀective core potentials
(ECP) are small-core ECPs describing 28 core electrons
and taking into account scalar relativistic eﬀects (mass-
velocity and Darwin terms). We also considered a third
eﬀective core potential, ECP36SDF (here after abbrevi-
ated SDF), also available for the Rb atom. The latter is
a large core ECP which only leaves 1 electron of the Rb
atom left for the molecular correlation treatment. The
corresponding sp functions have been used augmented
by the dhf-QZVPP basis set32, the ﬁnal number of con-
tracted functions is [9s8p4d3f 2g]. In the three cases one
set of spdf even tempered functions of each type has been
added. All available electrons, i.e not described by the
ECP, have been included in the correlation treatment.
The counterpoise method was used to account for the
basis set superposition error33. This correction is likely
to be important at small distances. The interatomic dis-
tance ROH was optimized at each RRb distance at the
MP2 level of theory (restricted34 and unrestricted35 vari-
ants, as appropriate) with all available electrons corre-
lated.

B. Results

The PEC at θ=0 ◦ calculated at small RRb distance
for the molecular anion RbOH−(2Σ+) and the neutral

RbOH(1Σ+) are reported in Figure 3. A grid of 0.01
and 0.1 ˚A was used at small distances (from 1.6 to
2.2 ˚A) and larger distances (2.2 to 4 ˚A), respectively.
The crossing points were obtained by ﬁtting the short-
distance part of the PEC with B-splines functions. Re-
sults obtained using the three diﬀerent ECPs are shown,
where the position of the crossing point between the
neutral and anion curves is indicated by squares. The
zero energy corresponds to the threshold energy of the
Rb(2S)+OH−(1Σ+) dissociation channel calculated with
each ECP. Large diﬀerences between the three ECPs are
observed, in particular regarding the positions of the min-
imum and the crossing point. Note that the crossing
height obtained using MWB is very close to the one ob-
tained by Byrd et al.9 who used the same ECP and ex-
trapolated to the complete basis set limit. The height of

CCSD(T) level of theory using the AV5Z basis set for the O
and H atoms. Results obtained using the MWB/spdfg, the
MWB/defQZ and the SDF/dhf-QZ ECPs and basis set for the
Rb atom are shown. The right ﬁgure shows the short-distance
part of the PEC where the crossing between the anion and
neutral curves are marked by squares. Solid and dashed lines
stand for the anion and neutral species, respectively.

the crossing point as a function of the angle θ is shown in
Figure 4. The function Vc(θ) obtained by ﬁtting the lat-
ter curves with a polynomial function of order 4 will be
used later to model the dynamics of the associative de-
tachment. For MDF, the crossing lies bellow the thresh-
old energy for certain value of θ while for MWB and
SDF it lies above for the entire angular space. This im-
plies that the autodetachment region is only accessible
at certain energies in the entrance channel.
To verify the accuracy of the ECP we have performed
geometry optimization on the ground state of several di-
atomic molecules containing the rubidium atom. The
results are given in Table II. The computed bond lengths
have been compared to the available experimental values.
The calculations have been performed at the CCSD(T)
level of theory with all available electrons correlated. We
have used diﬀerent basis sets to make sure that the dif-
ference seen on Figure 3 does not arise from a basis set
issue. For RbH, the computed bond length using MWB

Also shown are the converged values for the RRbO op-
timized distance for the ground state of the RbOH and
RbOH− molecules along with the results of Byrd et al.9.
This value represents the bond length between the Rb
and the O atom. Again, MWB bond lengths are larger
than MDF results for these systems. Note that in the
RbOH and RbOH− cases, the ROH distance was also op-
timized but the result using diﬀerent ECPs and basis set
only varies at the third or fourth digit. The poorer results
obtained with MWB can be explained by an error in the
ECP for the rubidium atom, as pointed out by Weigend
et al. and conﬁrmed by a personal communication of the
authors of MWB (see32 and reference therein). There-
fore, the MWB should not be used when dealing with
compounds that include the rubidium atoms. As for the
SDF, the lack of electron correlation leads to inaccurate
bond lengths and this ECP will not be appropriate to the
description of anions.

C. Langevin-based Dynamics

RbOH− is a stable molecular anion with an elec-
troaﬃnity of about 0.3 eV9. As has been shown in sec-
tion III B, the anion and neutral PES cross in the repul-
sive part of the PES, allowing the anion to enter into
the autodetachment region.
In the present case, it is
the collisional kinetic energy which allows the electron to
be ejected via a surface crossing mechanism40. In order
to calculate the rate constant for the associative detach-
ment reaction we have used a Langevin model similar
to the one described by Byrd et al. The assumptions
used in the model are the following: (i) the transition
probability from the anionic to the neutral state is 0
for RRb > Rc and 1 for R ≤ Rc where Rc is the nu-
clear position at the crossing point, (ii) the energy of
the colliding partners follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann dis-
tribution and (iii) the OH− molecules are rotating suﬃ-
ciently fast as to average the collisions over the angular
space. Langevin models have been successfully compared
to full quantum scattering calculations and to experimen-

with the AVQZ and AV5Z basis sets diﬀers by 0.02 ˚A
whereas MDF results agree within 0.006 ˚A and are there-
fore more consistent. The RbH optimized bond length
obtained with MWB and a AVQZ basis set is overesti-
mated by 0.23 ˚A while the MWB/AV5Z and all MDF
results are close to the experimental value. Note that
SDF strongly overestimates the bond length. This is not
surprising since only 2 electrons are included in the cor-
relation treatment. For RbCl, RbF and RbO, the com-
puted bond lengths determined with MDF and MWB
diﬀer up to 0.01 ˚A whereas the diﬀerences between the
three ECPs are of 0.02 ˚A in the best case. The MWB
ECP seems to overestimate the equilibrium bond length
whereas the SDF results are less consistent: overestima-
tion for RbCl and underestimation for RbF and RbO.
MDF results are much closer to the experimental values.

(O−+H41, S−+H42, H+Cl−43, H+Br− and H+F−44,45,
CO+O− and H2+O−46).
In our case the treatment is
simpliﬁed since only one molecular state of the anion
RbOH− correlates to the entrance channel, no barrier
is present along the PEC, and no other reaction channels
are available in the energy range of interest. The use of
the Langevin cross section should therefore be a reason-
able choice.
We summarize hereafter the main equations that lead to
the rate constant, for a more detailed description see9.
The associative reaction only occurs when the crossing
point is reached. This depends on the crossing height
Vc(θ) and the energy in the Rb(2S)+OH−(2Π) entrance
channel: ε + T(v,J) where ε is the collision energy and
T(v,J) the ro-vibrational energy of OH−. The total cross
section can be deﬁned as:

σtot(v, J, ε) = ρc(v, J, ε) σL(ε)

is the dipole polarizability of Rb(2S) which is 318.6
a.u47. The Ξ(ε, Vc(θ), T(v, J)) function is the Heavyside
function used in9. The θmax is the angle above which
Vc(θ) ≥ ε + T(v,J). The value of θmax thus depends
on v, J and ε. The rotational constant, vibrational fre-
quency and coupling terms used to obtain T(v,J) are
taken from48. The rate constant for associative detach-
ment can be written as

where f(ε) is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The
W(J) terms account for the weight of each rotational
state of OH− where the factor (2J+1) is the degener-
acy factor and Qrot is the rotational partition function.
W(J), which represent the rotational state population
of OH−, can be seen in Figure 5 as a function of the
temperature. In equation 5, summing up to J = 15 was
found suﬃcient since W(J) becomes very small for larger
J values. Using the Vc(θ) function obtained with the
MDF calculations and assuming that the OH− ions are
in their vibrational ground state (thus T(v,J)=T(0,J))

we obtained a rate constant of 4×10−10 cm3s−1 at 300 K.
This result agrees well with the ﬁrst experimental results
of Deiglmayer et al.14 where the measured rate constant
was 2+2−1 × 10−10cm3s−1 for a temperature between 200
K and 600 K.
We have also calculated the rate constant of the asso-
ciative detachment kad as a function of the temperature.
The resulting plots can be seen in Figure 6. As the tem-
perature decreases, the rate constant decreases. Two ef-
fects contribute to the latter : the decrease of the con-
tribution of large J values in W(J) and of the collision
energy ε. Both contributions reduce the accessible angu-
lar space, i.e the value of θmax, in equation (3), and thus
the cross section σtot in equation (5). The rate constant
kad only changes slightly with temperature, e.g kad only
decreases from a factor 1.2 between 400 and 2 K. The
rotational state of OH− may not be in thermal equilib-
rium in the hybrid trap where the reaction takes place.
A recent theoretical study11 showed that the J=0 state
of OH− may actually be the most populated one in the
trap. Therefore, we have also shown the calculated rate
constant for J=0 ﬁxed at all temperature. However, this
only aﬀects slightly the rate constant for high tempera-
ture e.g at 300 K the diﬀerence is only of 6%.
On the other hand, the rate constant strongly depends
on the height of the crossing point between the PESs
of the neutral and the anion. Since the crossing is lo-
cated in the repulsive region of the PES, its position is
very sensitive to the computational method and basis set
used. To illustrate this dependence, we have represented
in Figure 7 the rate constant at 300 K as a function of
the crossing height at linear geometry. The rate constant
was computed using the function Vc(θ) obtained with the
MDF ECP (see Figure 4) by varying Vc(0◦). Two regimes
can be distinguished. When the crossing point Vc(0◦) is
located below the entrance channel, the rate shows an
almost linear dependence on the crossing height. On the
other hand, when Vc(0◦) is located above the entrance
channel, the rate decreases exponentially with increas-

ing crossing height. The rates obtained based on calcu-
lations performed with the MDF ECP and various basis
sets are shown on the upper panel in Figure 7. The cross-
ing point at linear geometry is always located below the
entrance channel and the resulting rate is comprised be-
tween 3 × 10−10 and 7 × 10−10 cm−3s−1, which allows
us to deﬁne a theoretical uncertainty in the framework
of the Langevin model. The most accurate results are
expected to be obtained for the largest basis sets, i.e.
AV5Z/spdfg and AV6Z/spdfg. It should be noted that
the basis set superposition error does not have a signiﬁ-
cant eﬀect on the crossing point since the corrections to
the anion and neutral PESs are similar for large basis
sets. As discussed in section III B, the calculations per-
formed with the MWB and SDF ECPs lead to a crossing
point above the entrance channel. This results in an asso-
ciative detachment rate constant that is several orders of
magnitude smaller than the MDF and experimental val-
ues. This conﬁrms the fact that the MWB ECP should
not be trusted for small values of RRb whereas the lack
of correlated electrons in the SDF calculations leads to a
bad description of the chemical bond, especially for the
anion.
To conclude, we can say that the rate constant of the
associative detachment reaction Rb(2S)+OH−(1Σ+)→
RbOH(1Σ+)+ e− is almost constant with respect to the
temperature, i.e the collision energy ε and the rotational
population distribution of OH−.
In contrast, the rate
strongly depends on the position of the crossing point
which lays in the repulsive region and is therefore diﬃ-
cult to compute accurately. However, compare to the ex-
perimental results, we obtain agreement using the MDF
ECP with large basis sets. It is worth mentioning that

tachment reaction at 300 K as a function of the crossing point

ECPs are indicated by crosses. Upper panel: zoom in the

this problem would also appear if a full quantum descrip-
tion is used instead of the Langevin model to describe the
associative detachment reaction since the results will also
depend on the PES and on the position of the crossing
point.

IV. COLLISION WITH EXCITED RUBIDIUM

Collisions between electronically excited rubidium and
OH− are also likely to occur in the co-trapping exper-
iment. Moreover, the amount of rubidium in its ﬁrst
excited state can be tuned by varying the intensity of
the laser used in the magneto optical trap14. Charge
transfer and associative detachment reactions could both
occur from the excited entrance channel, since they are
both exothermic. Collision between molecular ions and
ultracold Rb have already been studied and have shown
some interesting features18. To investigate these possibil-

reaction channels.

A. Computational method

In order to calculate the diﬀerent PESs of the RbOH−
molecular system we have used the internally con-
tracted multi-reference conﬁguration interaction method
(ic-MRCI)49 as implemented in the MOLPRO program.
The reference wave function on which the single and dou-
ble excitations are performed is a state-averaged com-
plete active space wave function (SA-CASSCF) [cite]
with an active space covering 6σ and 3π molecular or-
bitals. The ﬁrst σ orbital, which corresponds to the 1s
orbital of the oxygen atom was kept frozen, i.e taken from
a previous Hartree-Fock calculation, to avoid rotation be-
tween the 1sO and 4sRb orbitals. The corresponding Cs
orbitals where used for the non-linear cases, hence 10a0
and 3a00 orbitals. We have included all states that corre-
late to the ﬁrst 3 dissociation channels, i.e Rb+OH−,
Rb−+OH and Rb*+OH−, in the state-average proce-
dure. The AVTZ basis set was used to describe the O
and H atoms27. For the rubidium atom we used the
MDF ECP with the corresponding spdfg valence basis
set31 and a set of spdf even tempered functions. The
OH interatomic distance, ROH, was kept ﬁxed at the
OH− experimental value of 0.9643 ˚A48. We have included
the Davidson correction using rotated reference energies
to account for the size inconsistency problem50–52. The
numbering of the diﬀerent states used in Figure 1 and
Table I has been kept for the following results.

B. Potential energy surfaces

The calculated adiabatic PECs at linear geometry are
shown on Figure 8. One can see an avoided crossing, in-
dicated by a square between the two 2Π states (labelled
1 2Π and 2 2Π, respectively) that allows the charge trans-
fer reaction Rb(2P)+OH−(1Σ+) → Rb−(1S)+OH(2Π)
to occur via non adiabatic coupling terms. The insets
in Figure 8 show a zoom of the avoided crossing with
and without Davidson correction. The energy gap be-
comes smaller when the correction is taken into account.
This arise from the diﬀerence in the Davidson correc-
tion for both states, where the negative charge is ei-
ther located on the Rb or the O atom. At bent ge-
ometries, the two 2Π states split into two 2A0 and two
2A00 states which undergo avoided crossings with each
other and with the 2A0 state arising from the 2 2Σ+ state.
This is shown on the inset in Figure 9 along with the
PECs for θ=20 ◦. We thus have 3 avoided crossings
where two are cuts through a conical intersection aris-
ing from a pseudo Jahn-Teller eﬀect53,54. The excited
rubidium is present in its J = 3/2 ﬁne structure state
in the MOT, the collision will therefore follow the 2 2Π
PEC. Taking into account the ﬁne structure of Rubidum,

which arises from spin-orbit coupling, the charge transfer
reaction Rb(2P3/2)+OH−(1Σ+) → Rb−(1S)+OH(2Π) is
exothermic with an energy release of 0.241 eV. This value
represents the energy diﬀerence between the entrance and
exit channels and is obtained by subtracting the elec-
tron aﬃnity of Rb (0.496 eV21) from the electron aﬃn-
ity of OH (1.8290 eV20) and then subtracting the ob-

state (1.589 eV22). When using the calculated energy
at 1000 ˚A we obtain 0.368 eV, which is 0.127 eV larger
that the experimental value. Several factors contribute
to the discrepancy between the calculated and experi-
mental values. The ﬁrst is the omission of the spin-orbit
splitting in our calculations. The second is the fact that
two electron aﬃnities are involved, which is known to be
diﬃcult to calculate accurately by quantum chemistry
methods16,55,56. To illustrate these diﬃculties, we have
computed the electron aﬃnity of OH and Rb and the ex-
citation energy of Rb at the CASSCF/ic-MRCI level of
theory using diﬀerent basis sets and active spaces. We
have also tested the eﬀect of the Davidson correction.
The results are depicted on Table III and IV for Rb and
OH, respectively.
From Table III we observe that the Davidson correction
is zero for the calculated EA and 4E when the 4s and
4p orbitals are closed. There is indeed only one and two
correlated electron for the neutral and anionic species,
respectively. When the 4s and 4p orbitals are open and
the corresponding orbitals correlated, the Davisdon cor-
rection signiﬁcantly improves the results. A clear trend
can be seen for the excitation energies (4E), which con-
verges towards the experimental result with increasing
active space size. Unfortunately, while including the 4s
and 4p orbitals improves the excitation energy, the EA is
worsened. One possible explanation is that the core-core
and core-valence correlation energy is more important for
the neutral than for the anion since the orbitals of the
latter are somewhat more diﬀuse. The contribution for
the neutral and anion are not correctly balanced and the
EA will in consequence become smaller when including
the 4s and 4p orbitals. The third columns shows the
results using an active space corresponding to the one
used in the molecular case. The EA is overestimated by
0.025 eV and the excitation energy underestimated by
0.113 eV. Comparison with results obtained from sepa-
rated CASSCF wave function for the neutral and anion
show than the deviations are mostly due to the inclusion
of the anion in the state average procedure, which desta-
bilizes the neutral orbitals. Increasing the active space to
include the 4d and 6s orbitals of Rb would improve the
results, however this become untreatable at the molecular
level from a computational point of view. These results
highlight the very well known diﬃculty to correctly de-
scribe anions.
The results obtained for OH in Table IV show a much
stronger dependence on the size of the active space,
Davidson correction and basis set. The results converge
towards the experimental value for large active space and
basis set. The electron aﬃnity calculated with the AVTZ
basis set with an active space covering the valence atomic
orbitals is 0.403 eV above the CCSD(T)/AVQZ results.
The Davidson correction improves the result by 0.348 eV.
This is not surprising since the correction accounts par-
tially for the quadruple excitation terms, known to be
important in OH−57.

Hence, the discrepancy between the calculated electron
aﬃnities and excitation energy and their respective ex-
perimental value explains the deviation between the cal-
culated and experimental energies at the dissociation
limit of the RbOH− specie.

Even if the presented results show some lack of
accuracy, we can already extract some trends con-
cerning the reactions occurring from the excited en-
trance channels. The associative detachment reaction
Rb(2P3/2)+OH−(1Σ+) → RbOH(1Σ+) + e− is energet-
ically possible, as shown in Figure 10 where the neu-
tral RbOH(1Σ+) curve along with those corresponding
to the ground and excited states of RbOH− are plot-
ted. The anion curve enters the autodetachment re-
gion around RRb=5 ˚A, below the threshold energy of
)+OH−(1Σ+) entrance channel (dashed black
the Rb(2P 3
2
line in Figure 10) and after the avoided crossing between
the two 2Π states. Note that the collisional detachment
)+OH−(1Σ+) → Rb(2S)+OH(2Π) + e−
reaction Rb(2P 3

is not accessible in the low temperature regime since the
exit channel is around 0.2 eV above the entrance channel.
A zoom in the crossing region is shown in Figure 11 for
θ=0◦ and θ=20◦. The neutral PECs have been obtained
using the same active space, ECP and basis set used for
the anion.
In the following discussion on the dynamics we limit our-
selves to the linear case for simplicity. The charge trans-
fer and the associative detachment reaction will compete
with each other. Assuming a transition probability close
to unity from the anionic state to the neutral state when
entering the autodetachment region, the AD reaction will
prevail over the CT reaction.
Indeed, the wave packet

In both cases the wave packet will enter the autodetach-
ment region and undergo associative detachment with a
probability close to unity, preventing the possibility for
the wave packet to exit via the CT channel. This as-
sumption is very rough and a full quantum description
would be necessary to get a correct branching ration be-
tween the AD and CT reactions. Moreover, the crossing
between the neutral and excited curves will vary with θ

and could lie above the energy at dissociation for certain
values of θ as in the case of the ground state (see sec-
tion III B). This can already be seen in Figure 11 where
the crossing at θ=20◦ occurs at a smaller distance and
slightly higher energy than for θ=0◦.
In addition, the
barrier which is present around 4 ˚A along the 2 2Π (2A’)
curve will also contribute to the dynamic. These two ef-
fects will probably increase the probability for the CT
reaction.

particular challenges due to the presence of a large corre-
lation space, and the diﬃculty to correctly describe the
electron charge transfer, the crossing with the neutral
curves and the energies at dissociation.

V. CONCLUSION

Based on the results presented in this work, we
can conclude that the rate constant of the associa-
tive detachment reaction (AD) Rb(2S)+OH−(1Σ+) →
RbOH(1Σ+)+e− strongly depends on the crossing point
between the neutral and anion potential energy surfaces.
This crossing point lies in the repulsive region of the PES,
which is diﬃcult to obtain accurately by quantum chem-
istry method.
In particular, the choice of the eﬀective
core potential for the Rb atom has a drastic eﬀect on the
position of the crossing point and therefore, on the rate
constant. Our results using the MWB ECP show a lack of
accuracy that has already be pointed out32 and seems to
arise from an error in the ECP. We therefore recommend
the use of the more recent MDF ECP when dealing with
compounds containing Rb. Using the crossing point ob-
tained with the MDF ECP along with a Langevin-based
model, we found a rate constant in agreement (within the
experimental uncertainty) with the experimental results
of Deiglmayr et al.14.
In addition, we found that the
rate constant only decreases slightly with the tempera-
ture, which means that the reaction would also take place
in the cold regime. The experimental and calculated rate
constant for the AD reaction is almost 10 times smaller
than the Langevin rate (4.3×10−9) which implies that
10% of the collisions are reactive. Concerning the impli-
cation for sympathetic cooling of OH− and the ongoing
Heidelberg experiment, the AD reaction should, in prin-
ciple, not prevent the feasibility of sympathetic cooling
but only lead to a loss of OH−14. Side eﬀects such as col-
lisions with vibrationally hot RbOH, product of the AD
reaction, may lead to some heating processes. However
this seems unlikely since the typical collision rate in such
environment is on the order of tens of Hz and the time
to escape the trap is in µs.
Collision between electronically excited Rb(2P) and
OH−(1Σ+) are also likely to occur. The presence of con-
ical intersections and avoided crossings in the entrance
channels, as shown by our calculations, suggests that
exothermic charge transfer (CT) Rb(2P)+OH−(1Σ+) →
Rb−(1S)+OH(2Π) could occur through non-adiabatic
couplings. The AD reaction Rb(2P)+OH−(1Σ+) →
RbOH(1Σ+)+e− is also energetically accessible and can
occur via the crossing between the excited entrance chan-
nel and the neutral PES, which delimits the autodetach-
ment region. Our ab initio results show that the AD re-
action should prevail over the CT reaction as the system
should undergo autodetachment before it can exit via the
CT channel. However, a full quantum calculation would
be needed in order to obtain the correct branching ratio

10

between the CT and AD reactions. In the context of the
Heidelberg experiment, the presence of Rb−, product of
the CT reaction, may be detected by the time-of-ﬂight
spectrometer if it stays trapped long enough in the rf-

from the excited channels since both the AD and CT re-
actions induce a discharge. One would also expects this
loss to be larger than the ground state since the polar-
izability of excited Rb(2P)(563 a.u58) is larger than for
the ground state Rb(2S)(318.6 a.u47). The Langevin rate
for the collision between excited Rb(2P) and OH−(1Σ+)
becomes 6.9×10−9. The observed rate constant is likely
to be even larger since the induced quadrupole term have
proven to be important for Rb(2P)18. This may be seen
by increasing the number of Rb atoms in their excited
states, i.e increasing the intensity of the laser used in the
MOT and comparing the results with the loss induced by
collision with the ground state Rb(2S).
A comparison with other alkali atoms is currently under
investigation. We will also study the eﬀect of the spin-
orbit on the low lying states of RbOH− and perform full
quantum calculations on the dynamics. The presence of
a charge transfer reaction involving anions in a cold en-
vironment oﬀers exciting experimental opportunities and
we hope that our results may help to interpret some fu-
ture experimental results.
