Abstract

In the present work, we report a detailed density functional theory calculation on polymorphic

InVO4 phases by means of projector augmented wave method. The computed ﬁrst-order structural

phase transformation from orthorhombic (Cmcm) to monoclinic (P2/c) structure is found to occur

around 5.6 GPa along with a large volume collapse of 16.6%, which is consistent with previously

reported experimental data. This transformation also leads to an increase in the coordination

number of vanadium atom from 4 to 6. The computed equilibrium and high pressure structural

properties of both InVO4 phases, including unit cell parameters, equation of state, and bulk moduli,

are in good agreement with the available experimental data. In addition, compressibility is found

to be highly anisotropic and the b-axis being more compressible than the other for both the

structures. Electronic band structures for both the phases were calculated, and the band gap for

orthorhombic and monoclinic InVO4 are found to be 4.02 and 1.67 eV, respectively, within the

Tran-Blaha Modiﬁed Becke-Johnson potential as implemented in linearized augmented planewave

method. We further examined the optical properties such as dielectric function, refractive index,

and absorption spectra for both the structures. From the implications of these results, it can be

proposed that the high pressure InVO4 phase can be more useful than orthorhombic phase for

photo catalytic applications.

INTRODUCTION

ABO4 type ternary oxides are very important from the theoretical and technological

point of view.1–6 The fundamental physical and chemical properties of these kinds of mate-

rials have been investigated at normal conditions and under compression through diﬀerent

experiments and theoretical calculations. For example, diﬀerent types of tungstate (WO4)

are promising materials for the next generation cryogenic phonon-scintillation detectors,

laser-host materials, optoelectonic devices, and mining.7–14 Also, materials belonging to the

orthovanadates (VO4) have been widely investigated for their eﬃcient luminescent prop-

erties, promising photocatalytic properties, low loss optical planar wave guides, capability

to convert the ultraviolet emission into visible light, etc.15–23 These investigations revealed

that these compounds possess very attractive properties, which are in fact technologically

important within a wider scope.

The present computed compound InVO4 is one of the orthovanadate, which has attract-

ing electrochemical and photocatalytic properties and can be used in diﬀerent industrial

applications.24–26 Researches on InVO4 have revealed that it can be used as photovoltaic

cells for solar energy utilization and as a photocatalyst that is able to induce hydrolysis of

water molecules under visible light irradiation.6 It is also useful as electrolyte for lithium ion

batteries since it undergoes conversion of indium, vanadium oxide, and alloying reactions of

indium27 and electrochromic windows due to their transparency.28 The reason that makes

its use as a good photovoltaic cell is the vanadium 3d band, which is situated below the

analogous d band of the other transition metals in the energy spectrum decreasing the band

gap.6

Previous studies on InVO4 were limited to crystal structure, vibrational properties, and

optical properties at high temperatures. These studies also included the photocatalytic

properties of InVO4 in bulk and in thin-ﬁlm conﬁgurations.29–35,37 Recently, Errandonea et

al.30 experimentally reported a high pressure phase transformation of InVO4 from CrVO4

type (crystallizing in orthorhombic structure) to wolframite type (crystallizing in mono-

clinic structure) phase with a large volume collapse. The transition is associated with a

change in coordination number around vanadium atom. From this, we can expect some

changes in the electronic structure for the high pressure phase of InVO4. Earlier experimen-

tal electronic properties of orthorhombic InVO4 have been reported using optical absorption

2

measurements.25,32,33 Band gap values are around 2 eV for bulk structure and 3.5 eV for

thin ﬁlm (at nearly 723 K). On the other hand, theoretical electronic structure calculations

of the bulk InVO4 have also been calculated by ﬁrst principle calculations within standard

exchange-correlation functionals (reported a band gap of 3.1 eV).6,35,36 Apart from these,

there were no theoretical studies exploring the high pressure behavior of InVO4 to compli-

ment the experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no theoretical or experimental studies

on electronic and optical properties of the high pressure phase were reported. This kind of

high pressure study of any material is very important in understanding their optoelectronic

properties as the knowledge about optical properties of materials at high pressure provides

insight about their performances in practical applications. With this motivation, in this

study, we present theoretical calculations for structural properties in comparison with the

experiment as well as the electronic and optical properties for both the phases of InVO4.

The remaining paper is organized as follows. In section II, we brieﬂy describe the crystal

structure and computational details. Results and discussion concerning the structural, elec-

tronic, and optical properties of InVO4 and the structural transformation are presented in

section III, and ﬁnally, section IV summarizes the conclusions.

II. CRYSTAL STRUCTURE AND CALCULATIONAL DETAILS

From previous reports, it was found that InVO4 is a polymorphic material, which can

be found in ﬁve diﬀerent types of structures29,30,37 in nature. Among them, phase-I is mon-

oclinic and is a temperature dependent phase. Phase-III is orthorhombic and found at

ambient pressure and phase-V is monoclinic, which is the high pressure phase. From recent

experiments,30 a phase transition from phase-III (orthorhombic) to phase-V (monoclinic) at

7 GPa is found to occur. On the other hand, phase-II and phase-IV are intermediate phases,

and there structures are still unknown. In this work, we have only discussed about the crys-

tal structure of phase-III, which is orthorhombic, and phase-V, which is monoclinic. The

crystal structures of orthorhombic phase is made up of InO6 octahedra and V O4 tetrahedra,

and the InO6 octahedra are connected by sharing the edges forming a linear chain of octa-

hedra units along the c-axis, while the chains are linked by V O4 sharing only the corners.

In the case of monoclinic structure, these blocks are InO6 and V O6 octahedra.30 The crystal

structure of orthorhombic and monoclinic phases of InVO4 are shown in Fig. 1. The projec-

tor augmented wave (PAW) approach has been used to perform the ab-initio calculations,

which is implemented through vienna ab-initio simulation package38 based on density func-

tional theory (DFT).39,40 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA)41 was used to treat

electron-electron interactions in InVO4. The Broyden-Fletcher-Goldgarb-Shanno (BFGS)

minimization scheme42 has been used for structural relaxation. The convergence criteria for

structural optimization of both the InVO4 structures were performed with a kinetic energy

cutoﬀ of 900 eV and we have used Monkhorst Packing43 as (9 9 8) for gamma centered

grid. The valence electronic conﬁgurations of the atoms considered here are as follows: In:

[5s25p1], V: [3p63d44s1], and O: [2s22p4]. The self-consistent energy convergence was set to

1 × 10−8 eV/atom. The convergence criterion for the maximal force between atoms was
0.01 eV/˚A. For calculating the electronic structure, full potential linear augmented plane

wave (FP-LAPW) method implemented using WIEN2k package has been used with the

Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and Tran-Blaha Modiﬁed Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) func-

tional. The performance of TB-mBJ functional for calculating the band structure and the

band gap of semiconductors and the insulators is more accurate. After getting convergence,

the K-point is ﬁxed to 5000 in order to obtain self consistency in irreducible Brillouin zone.

In our calculation, we set the energy separation between core and valance electrons as -6

Ry. Radius of muﬃn tin for all the atoms are chosen as default value.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. Structural properties of Polymorphic InVO4

As discussed in Section II, the polymorphic InVO4 crystallizes in orthorhombic structure

(with space group Cmcm) at ambient conditions and transforms to monoclinic structure

(with space group P2/c) under compression. As a ﬁrst step, we have performed geometry

optimization with full structural relaxations including lattice parameters and atomic posi-

tions to compare the experimentally reported transition. Here, the theoretical transition

pressure in polymorphic InVO4 can be clearly depicted from the hydrostatic pressure de-

pendance of enthalpy from 0 to 14 GPa with a step size of 1 GPa. For instance, we included

the diﬀerences in enthalpies for orthorhombic and monoclinic structures and are shown in

Fig.2. From this, it can be clearly seen that the orthorhombic phase is stable at ambient

conditions (since enthalpy less than other structure) and monoclinic structure is energeti-

cally favourable from above 6 GPa. Note that our calculated transition pressure (5.6 GPa)

agrees well with the experimental value of 7 GPa. Further, we calculated ground state and

high pressure structural parameters (lattice parameters, atomic positions, and bond lengths)

of both the structures and are compared with those of the experimental data, as shown in

Tables I-III. From table I, the calculated volumes are slightly overestimated with the exper-

parameters such as atomic positions and bond lengths calculated agree quite well with the

experiments.

Now, we move to analyze the eﬀect of hydrostatic pressure on lattice parameters and vol-

umes of both structures. The variation in the lattice parameters (a, b, and c) with respect to

pressure along with experiment is shown in Fig. 3. From this plot, it is clear that the lattice

parameters are decreasing with pressure, and it can be seen that there is a sudden change

in the obtained parameters, which is expected due to structural transition. It is also clear

from the Fig. 3 that the calculated values are in good agreement throughout the pressure

range with the experimental values. The compressibility of each lattice parameter according

to pressure variation can be well described with the ﬁrst order pressure coeﬃcients. The

calculated ﬁrst order pressure coeﬃcients for lattice parameters a, b, and c of orthorhombic
phase are 0.35×10−2 ˚A/GPa, 7.04×10−2 ˚A/GPa, and 2.47×10−2 ˚A/GPa, respectively. For
monoclinic phase, these values are 0.03×10−2, 2.72×10−2, and 0.49×10−2 ˚A/GPa, respec-

tively. From these values, it can be said that the ﬁrst order pressure coeﬃcient of lattice

parameter b > c > a for both the phases. This also shows that the lattice parameter b is

the most compressible. This can be expected as from the arrangement of the InO6 and VO4

polyhedra in the unit cell. The anisotropic compression can be related with the fact that

there are no VO4 tetrahedra in between the InO6 octahedra along the b-axis direction.

In addition, we have also plotted volume as a function of pressure, which is shown in the

Fig. 4. From this plot, it can be seen that there is a large volume collapse of nearly 16.6%,

which is close to the experimental value of 14 %. This conﬁrms the ﬁrst-order character of

the phase transition, which is taking place under the application of pressure from CrVO4

type orthorhombic InVO4 to wolframite type monoclinic InVO4 structure. As depicted in

Fig. 4, ambient phase orthorhombic structure is more compressible when compared to high

pressure phase of monoclinic structure. On the other hand, from the obtained P-V data,

we can get the equation of state (EOS) parameters using Murnaghan equation,44 which

are given in the Table I along with the experimental values. From the table I, we can see

that the calculated values are in good agreement with experimental values, where B0 is the

bulk modulus and B ′

0 is its pressure derivative. From this analysis, it can be said that the

bulk modulus for the monoclinic structure is nearly three times larger than that of the low

pressure orthorhombic structure. This is consistent with large volume collapse associated

with the phase transition and the fact that the monoclinic phase is much denser than that

of the orthorhombic phase. On the other hand, this indicates the increase in coordination

number around vanadium atom. Note that the computed bulk modulus for CrVO4 type

InVO4 is also comparable with previously reported results of InPO4.45 The reported bulk

modulus (B0) and its pressure derivative (B ′

0) for InPO4 is 78.65 GPa and 4.05, which are of

the same order for InVO4 given in Table I. In addition, we also computed the bond lengths

as a function of pressure for both structures and are shown in Fig. 5. From this, we found

that all the bond lengths are decreasing with pressure and also the In-O2 bond length in

orthorhombic structure is more compressible than the other.

B. Electronic Structure

The calculated band structures of the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases of InVO4,

using the FP-LAPW approach within TB-mBJ functional along the various symmetry lines,

are shown in Fig. 6. These calculations were performed at optimized structures as dis-

cussed in Section III A. It is a known fact that the standard DFT functional local density

approximation (LDA)/GGA always underestimate band gap.46–50 In order to compare, we

have used GGA functional along with the TB-mBJ functional for calculating band gaps.

The obtained band gap for the orthorhombic phase is 3.13 eV using PBE method and 4.02

eV using TB-mBJ functional. For the monoclinic structure, the calculated band gaps are

1.67 and 1.04 eV using TB-mBJ and PBE functional, respectively. The calculated band gap

from GGA functional for orthorhombic structure is in good agreement with the previously

reported theoretical band gap of nearly 3 eV6,35,36 using LDA/GGA functional. It is to be

noted that earlier experiments based on optical absorption measurements indicate 2 eV band

gap for orthorhombic InVO4.25,32 The diﬀerence between the presently computed band gap

and experimental band gap for orthorhombic phase might be due to the electron excitonic

eﬀect, which is beyond the scope of TB-mBJ functional calculation.

From the electronic band structure shown in the Fig. 6, it is found that the orthorhombic

InVO4 is a direct band gap material as the band gap occurs along the Y direction between

the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum(CBM). The monoclinic

InVO4 is an indirect band gap material as the band gap occurs along the Γ-Z direction

between the VBM and CBM. Except this indirect band gap, there are two more minimum

direct band gaps present in Z and Γ directions, which are 1.78 and 1.84 eV, respectively.

As these direct band gaps are slightly larger in magnitude than the indirect band gap,

they are preferred for optical transitions and can contribute in the visible light absorption.

Fig. 7 shows the density of states(DOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) of both the

structures, which have been calculated using TB-mBJ functional.

It can be clearly seen

from the partial density of states(PDOS) of the orthorhombic InVO4 that between -5 eV to

-3.5 eV, there are mainly two peaks available because of the s-states of the indium, d -states

of the vanadium, and the p-states of the oxygen. The states, predominant between -3.5

and -2 eV, are mainly because of vanadium atom, and this contribution is mainly due to

d -states. Near the fermi level between -2 to 0 eV, the main contribution is from the oxygen

p-states. So, it is clear that the top of the valence band is composed mainly of p-states of

oxygen. It is also clear from the Fig. 7 that the bottom of the conduction band is mainly

composed of d -states of vanadium atom including little contribution due to s-state of indium

and p-state of oxygen at about 4 eV. On the other hand, for monoclinic InVO4, there are

very less contributions due to indium atom. Vanadium atom dominates through a wide

range (-4.5eV to -2.5eV) due to d -states. From -4.5 to -3 eV, the main contribution is from

the p-states of O1 atom. At nearly -3.5 eV, there is an overlap between the vanadium atom

and the O1 atom, which suggests a strong covalent behavior between vanadium and oxygen

which conﬁrms that the top of the valance band is mainly due to p-states of the oxygen

atom. The bottom of the conduction band is mainly composed of d -states of vanadium

atom with a little contribution of p-states of O2 atom at about 1.7eV. It can be seen from

this discussion that for both the structures, the conduction band minima mainly consists

of d -states of vanadium atom and the valence band maximum mainly consists of p-states

of oxygen atom, favoring both the structures as photo-catalysts.6,35 In comparison to other

photocatalytic materials, such as 4d and 5d metal compounds InNbO4 and InTaO4 and

the well known photocatalyst TiO2, orthorhombic InVO4 (3d ) has already proven to be a

good photocatalyst for wider wave length region. The band gaps are 3.7 eV (InTaO4), 3.4

eV (InNbO4), 3.1 eV (InVO4), and 2.5 eV (TiO2), respectively.6,35 It has been shown that

in order to active a photocatalyst in the longer wavelength region, one needs to lower the

bottom of the 3d conduction band. This help us to conclude that the monoclinic phase

could be a promising photo-catalyst than the orthorhombic phase, as the bottom of the

conduction band is lower than the orthorhombic phase.

C. Optical Properties

To calculate the optical properties for the orthorhombic and monoclinic phase of InVO4,

we have used the TB-mBJ functional. Optical properties of any material can be well de-

scribed by its dielectric function, which is given by ǫ(q, ω) = ǫ1(ω) + ıǫ2(ω), where q is

the momentum transfer in the photon-electron interaction and ω is the energy transfer.

The imaginary part ǫ2(ω) of the dielectric function ǫ(q, ω) represents the direct inter band

transitions between valence band and conduction band states. Here, in this calculation, we

have neglected the intraband transitions as contribution from this type of transition is very

less. From the selection rule, it can be said that the inter band transitions occur only in

momentum quantum number states given by ∆L=±1. The real part of the dielectric tensor

ǫ1 can be calculated using the Kramer’s-Kronig transformation. Here, in this study, ǫ2 has

been calculated up to 10 eV. The important optical properties of any material such as

absorption and refractive index can be calculated from the proper knowledge of the real and

imaginary parts of the dielectric function. Fig. 8 shows the real and imaginary part of the

dielectric function of orthorhombic and monoclinic InVO4. In this ﬁgure, A, B, C, D, E,

and F along the XX direction, M, N, O, P, Q, R, and S along YY, and U, V, W, X, and Y

along the ZZ direction are the prominent peaks. As the peaks in the imaginary part of the

dielectric function mainly arise due to the inter-band transitions between VBM and CBM in

the diﬀerent energy levels, using these peaks of imaginary part of the dielectric function and

the calculated TB-mBJ electronic band structure shown in Fig. 6, we have calculated dif-

ferent inter-band transitions. In case of Orthorhombic InVO4, the allowed transitions are as

follows: (a) O(p)→V(d) in the 4 to 6 eV energy range, (b) V(d)→O(p) in the 6-8 eV range,

(c) In(s)→O(p) in the 8-9 eV range. Among these transitions, the dominant part is the

O(p)→V(d). In the case of monoclinic InVO4, the allowed transitions are (a) O(p)→V(d)

in the 1.67-3.5 eV range, (b) O(p)→V(d) in the 3.5-5.5 eV range, and (c)V(d)→O(p) in the

2-4 eV range. In both cases, the dominant transitions are taking place in the same manner

except the decrease in the band gap values for monoclinic InVO4. These allowed transitions

are given in the Table IV. The calculated values of real part of the dielectric constants near

to zero photon energy are ǫXX

1

(0) = 2.96, ǫY Y

1

(0) = 3.14, and ǫZZ

1 (0) = 3.49 for orthorhom-

bic phase and ǫXX

1

(0) = 6.26, ǫY Y

1

(0) = 6.05, and ǫZZ

1 (0) = 5.67 for monoclinic phase.

Refractive index corresponding to this photon energy is nXX (0) = 1.72, nY Y (0) = 1.77, and

nZZ(0) = 1.87 for orthorhombic phase and nXX(0) = 2.5, nY Y (0) = 2.46, and nZZ(0) = 2.38

for monoclinic phase. It can be seen from the values given above that the index of refraction

for orthorhombic phase is high in the ZZ direction and low in the XX direction at nearly

0 eV energy. In case of monoclinic phase, this value of refractive index is high in the XX

direction and low in the ZZ direction. The calculated index of refraction in three diﬀerent

directions is shown in Fig. 9. The maximum indices of refraction shown in Fig. 9 are

nXX = 2.57 at 4.35 eV, nY Y = 2.61 at 4.58 eV, and nZZ = 2.82 at 4.5 eV for orthorhombic

phase and nXX = 3.23 at 2.07 eV, nY Y = 3.13 at 2.3 eV, and nZZ = 2.88 at 3.03 eV for

monoclinic phase. Fig. 10 shows the absorption spectra of both the orthorhombic and mon-

oclinic InVO4 phases. It is clearly seen from the ﬁgure that both the structures show optical

anisotropy in the three diﬀerent directions and the optical properties are diﬀerent for diﬀer-

ent directions. Also, the peaks for orthorhombic phase located approximately above 4 eV

(230-250 nm) and at nearly 3 eV (380-450 nm) for monoclinic phase. The absorption peaks

of monoclinic phase fall more under the visible light region than those of the orthorhombic

phase. This indicates that the absorption in monoclinic InVO4 is similar to the previously

16

reported experimental values,25,32 which helps up to conclude that the monoclinic phase

has the ability to utilize the solar energy in wide range. This absorption of visible light by

monoclinic phase of InVO4 may be derived from the large and delocalized DOS around the

CBM and small energy band gaps of the two direct optical transition points along Z and G

as mentioned in the electronic structure discussion.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have reproduced the structural phase transition of InVO4 and found that

the calculated transition pressure and structural parameters related to both structures are

in good agrement with the previously reported experimental data. The computed volume

collapse of 16.6% across the transition pressure and a drastic increase in bulk modului are

consistent with the experiments. The changes in the crystal symmetry from CrVO4 type

to wolframite type structure lead to change in the coordination number of vanadium atom

from four to six. The hydrostatic pressure dependance structural properties show, both the

phases are highly anisotropic, orthorhombic structure is more compressible than that of the

monoclinic structure, and b-axis is more compressible than other axes. Furthermore, the

examined electronic band structure calculations indicate that the obtained band gap for

monoclinic structure is found to be less than orthorhombic structure. Finally, we have cal-

culated the optical properties for both structures and found considerable optical anisotropy.

The obtained optical transitions for both structures are similar in nature except the lower

value of the electronic band gap for monoclinic structure. As the orthorhombic InVO4 is

already a well established photo-catalyst, we can say, that monoclinic phase is more suitable

for the photo-catalyst than the orthorhombic phase in the visible light range.
