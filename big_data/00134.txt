ABSTRACT

We report on the discovery of broad Balmer absorption lines variability in the QSO
SDSS J125942.80+121312.6, based on the optical and near-infrared spectra taken from
the SDSS-I, SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and TripleSpec
observations over a timescale of 5.8 years in the QSO’s rest-frame. The blueshifted
absorption proﬁle of Hβ shows a variation of more than 5σ at a high velocity portion
(> 3000 km s−1) of the trough. We perform a detailed analysis for the physical con-
ditions of the absorber using Balmer lines as well as metastable He I and optical Fe
II absorptions (λ4233 from b4P5/2 level and λ5169 from a6S5/2) at the same velocity.
These Fe II lines are identiﬁed in the QSO spectra for the ﬁrst time. According to the
photoionization simulations, we estimate a gas density of n(H) ≈ 109.1 cm−3 and a col-
umn density of Ncol(H) ≈ 1023 cm−2 for the BOSS data, but the model fails to predict
the variations of ionic column densities between the SDSS and BOSS observations if
changes in ionizing ﬂux are assumed. We thus propose transverse motion of the absorb-
ing gas being the cause of the observed broad Balmer absorption line variability. In fact,
we ﬁnd that the changes in covering factors of the absorber can well-reproduce all of the
observed variations. The absorber is estimated ∼ 0.94 pc away from the central engine,
which is where the outﬂow likely experiences deceleration due to the collision with the
surrounding medium. This scheme is consistent with the argument that LoBAL QSOs
may represent the transition from obscured star-forming galaxies to classic QSOs.

Introduction

Broad absorption lines (BALs) are absorptions exhibited in the spectra of QSOs with velocity
widths more than 2000 km s−1. Their troughs are generally found blueshifted relative to the
systemic redshift of QSOs, and believed to originate from the outﬂow from the inner region of
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with outward velocity in the range several thousand km s−1 to 0.2c
(Weymann et al. 1981). Thus BALs provide unique diagnostics to the dynamics and physical
conditions of the outﬂowing material. As one of the major forms of AGN feedback, these massive
winds may play a critical role in the growth of super massive black holes (SMBHs) and the evolution
of their host galaxies (Granato et al. 2004; Scannapieco & Oh 2004; Hopkins et al. 2008).

It is now well known that BAL systems show both short-term (several months in the QSOs’
rest-frame) and long-term (a few years) variability in absorption proﬁles (Barlow et al. 1992).
There are a couple of works in the literature on the variability of high-ionization BALs (HiBALs)
(Lundgren et al. 2007: C IV; Gibson et al. 2008, 2010: C IV and Si IV; Capellupo et al. 2011, 2012,
2013: C IV and Si IV; Filiz Ak et al. 2012, 2013: C IV and Si IV). The detection fraction of long-
term variations in HiBAL proﬁles is greater than 50% (Capellupo et al. 2011; Filiz Ak et al. 2013).
The variations are much more frequently found as changes in absorption depth than overall velocity
shift. In addition, BAL variability is found to be larger at higher velocity portions of the troughs
(Lundgren et al. 2007; Gibson et al. 2008; Capellupo et al. 2011). Two possibilities causing BAL
variability are suggested, including the movement of the absorbing medium across our line of sight
(LOS) and changes in ionization. The former scenario of varying covering factors is more favored
since Barlow et al. (1992), Lundgren et al. (2007), and Gibson et al. (2008) found no strong
correlation between BAL variability and continuum changes. However, they could only look at
the near-UV variability from the same spectra presenting BAL variations. Without simultaneous
observations of extreme-UV ﬂux, the variability of ionizing radiation remained unclear. On the
other hand, Wang et al. (2015) claimed a signiﬁcant negative correlation between the equivalent
widths (EWs) of BALs and continuum ﬂux. Furthermore, they found synchronized variations of
emission and absorption line EWs. Taking into account the intrinsic Baldwin eﬀect, they believed
that BAL variability is driven mainly by changes in ionization in response to continuum variations.

In principle, the changes in the physical conditions of the absorbers at diﬀerent epochs could
deﬁnitively reveal the origin of the BAL variability. Unfortunately, HiBAL QSOs, which make up
∼ 80% of all BAL QSOs, are not very useful in studying the physical states of the absorbers. Usually
only a single trough of blended doublets is able to be detected. Since the resonant transitions of
abundant ions are easily to be saturated, it is very diﬃcult to determine the true optical depths. In
cases of partial covering, the observed depths of the HiBAL troughs indicate the covering factors
rather than the optical depths. Sub-populations of BALs, such as iron low-ionization BALs (Fe
II and Fe III, FeLoBALs) or even rarer hydrogen Balmer series or metastable He I lines, are
proved very powerful in constraining the physical conditions of absorbing gas (Wampler et al.
1995; de Kool et al. 2001, 2002; Leighly et al. 2011; Ji et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2015). Vivek et
al. (2012, 2014) reported lower occurrence fraction of varying LoBALs and FeLoBALs compared

– 3 –

with HiBALs. Zhang et al. (2015) presented a small sample of 28 BAL QSOs, and found that
all strong variations of absorption are related with overlapping UV Fe II troughs. The results
of photoionization simulations suggest that the absorbers are of high density (> 106 cm−3) and
close to the central engines (less than several tens of parsecs). They concluded that these strong
variations are due to the movement of absorbing gas across the LOS.

The overlapping UV Fe II absorptions have a major drawback that the blending of numerous
lines makes it impossible to measure the ionic column densities on any individual levels, limiting
the accuracy of the inferred physical conditions of absorbers. Instead, the well-separated hydrogen
Balmer lines and/or metastable He I lines can give a more reliable estimate.
In this work, we
report on the variability of BALs in the H I Balmer series in the QSO SDSS J125942.80+121312.6
(hereafter as J1259+1213). This object also shows overlapping UV Fe II troughs. For the ﬁrst
time, we identify excited optical Fe II absorption lines in the QSO spectra, which allow for an
accurate measurement for Fe+. Using these absorptions, the dynamic structure and the physical
conditions of the absorber can be well-deﬁned. We demonstrate that only the scenario of the
absorbing medium moving across the LOS can explain the observed BAL variations. This paper is
organized as follows. In §2 we describe the observational features in the SDSS-I, SDSS-III Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and TripleSpec spectra, and the identiﬁcations of optical
Fe II lines. In §3 we measure the absorption lines in the BOSS spectrum and estimate the physical
properties of the absorber using photoionization simulations. The origin of the proﬁle variations
among the SDSS, BOSS and TripleSpec spectra is analyzed in §4. In §5 we estimate the properties
of the QSO and the outﬂow. A brief summary of the results is presented in §6. Throughout this
paper we assume a cosmology with H0 = 70km s−1Mpc−1, ΩM = 0.3 and ΩΛ = 0.7.

2. The Observations and BAL Variability

J1259+1213 is a z = 0.751 QSO with strong broad H I Balmer absorption lines reported by
Hall (2007) according to its SDSS DR5 spectrum. The SDSS spectrum, which is corrected for the
Galactic extinction using the dust maps by Schlegel et al. (1998) and the mean extinction curve of
the Milky Way by Fitzpatrick & Massa (2007), is shown in Figure 1 (red line in panel (b)). The
deepest Balmer absorption is ∼ 2960 km s−1 blueshifted to the systemic redshift and the troughs
have a velocity width more than 2300 km s−1. The ﬂux blueward of 2600 ˚Ain the QSO’s rest-frame
drops due to the absorption of overlapping UV Fe II troughs. Comparing the SDSS spectrum
with the reddened SDSS QSO composite spectrum (Vanden Berk et al. 2001) which best-ﬁts the
observation in rest-frame optical (longer than 3800 ˚A, see Figure 1 panel (b) cyan line), we ﬁnd that
the relative absorption depths are about 0.5 throughout the troughs between rest-frame 2210 and
2610 ˚A. Since the ionization potentials of low-ionization metal ions Mg+ and Fe+ are close to that
of atomic hydrogen, we suppose that Mg II and Fe II absorptions have the similar proﬁle to Balmer
lines. Thus the absorptions in the ranges of rest-frame 2543.19-2609.56 ˚Aand 2212.05-2393.38 ˚Aare
dominated by Fe II multiplets UV1 and UV2,3 from the ground term, respectively (the dark gray

– 4 –

areas in Figure 1 panel (b)), while a considerable fraction of absorptions in between should be
ascribed to lines from terms with exciting energy Eex > 2.5 eV (the light gray areas in Figure 1
panel (b)). The relative depths of ∼ 0.5 for these highly excited lines indicate a very high column
density for Fe+, for which the ground multiplets should be saturated. However, the spectrum at
these wavelengths is non-black, suggesting that the absorber does not fully obscure the background
source.

The object was also observed in the SDSS-III BOSS on 2012 February 26, 3.9 years after the
SDSS spectroscopic observation in the QSO’s rest-frame. The new BOSS spectrum has a wider
wavelength coverage and a higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The Galactic extinction-corrected
BOSS spectrum is plotted in Figure 1 panel (b) in black. H I Balmer series from Hβ to H10 are
clearly detected.

Comparing the SDSS and BOSS spectra, we ﬁnd no change in the unabsorbed QSO continuum
and emission longward rest-frame 3750 ˚A. However, there are clear variations in the absorption
proﬁles of Balmer lines despite the low S/N of the SDSS data. To measure the variations, we
use a pair-matching method to deﬁne the unabsorbed level for the rest-frame optical spectrum
which is better than the rough estimate using the SDSS QSO composite spectrum. For each
individual BOSS spectrum from a library of non-BAL QSOs, we ﬁt it with the spectral features
of J1259+1213 surrounding optical BALs. If the reduced χ2 < 1.5, we consider the ﬁt acceptable,
and thus 105 spectra are selected in total. The mean spectrum of these selected spectra will be
used as unabsorbed optical template for J1259+1213, and the variance is used to estimate template
uncertainty. The method is described in detail in Zhang et al. (2014) and Liu et al. (2015). The
resultant template is plotted as blue line in Figure 1 panels (d)-(f). According to this template, we
ﬁnd the rest-frame EW of Hβ increases from 12.2 ± 1.2 ˚Ato 20.3 ± 0.9 ˚A. The error represents 1σ
uncertainty, including statistical ﬂuctuation in ﬂux and template uncertainty, and the variation is
thus greater than 5σ. In the velocity space as shown in Figure 2 panels (a) and (b), we ﬁnd that
the Hβ proﬁle becomes deeper by 50-100% blueward −3000 km s−1. That the absorption proﬁle
changes more signiﬁcantly at higher blueshifting velocity is consistent with the results observed for
high-ionization lines.

With the improved data quality and unabsorbed template, we identify that He I* λ3889 also
contributes to the H8 absorption trough at rest-frame 3850 ˚A. In the BOSS spectrum, the trough
has an EW of 5.52 ± 0.21 ˚A, larger than Hǫ (4.96 ± 0.19 ˚A) which should be ∼ 60% stronger than
H8.

A followup TripleSpec near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observation was performed on 2015
May 26 (see Figure 3 top panel), 1.8 years after the BOSS observation in the QSO’s rest-frame.
The spectrum covers from rest-frame 5551 to 14065 ˚A. The broad absorption trough of Hα is also
detected at the same radial velocity as higher-order Balmer lines in the SDSS and BOSS spectra.
At high blueshifted velocity portion of the trough, nearly all background ﬂux is absorbed, indicating
a further variation of Balmer lines along with the time.

– 5 –

J1259+1213 was also monitored photometrically by the Catalina survey from 2005 May to
2013 July. The light curve is plotted in Figure 1 panel (a). The diﬀerence of V-band magnitude
between the SDSS and BOSS observations is 0.07 ± 0.17. The ﬁlter of Catalina V-band is centered
at ∼ 3100 ˚Ain the QSO’s frame. We ﬁnd the V-band ﬂux decreases from the SDSS to the BOSS
spectra by 18%, corresponding to 0.18 mag. This result is consistent with the photometric data
within errors, indicating no severe problem existing in the ﬂux calibration for the spectroscopic
data. Thus, we conclude that the near-UV to optical continuum shows no signiﬁcant variability.
However, because of lacking simultaneous observations of extreme-UV ﬂux, we know little about
the ionizing radiation variability. The changes of ionization as a cause of BAL variations cannot be
deﬁnitively ruled out. To reveal the origin of BAL variations, further investigations of the physical
conditions of the absorber are required.

3. Measurement and Modeling the Absorber in BOSS observation

To explore the nature of BAL variability, we start with the BOSS observation, which has much
higher S/N. Broad hydrogen Balmer absorption lines from Hβ to H10 are well-detected in the BOSS
spectrum, oﬀering a unique opportunity to determine the velocity structure of H I absorber and
column density on the hydrogen n = 2 shell.

In the spectrum we ﬁnd the residual ﬂux of the saturated UV Fe II troughs is larger than the
UV Fe II emission bump in the SDSS QSO composite spectrum (the underlying dark green line in
Figure 1 panel (b)) by 60-100%. Furthermore, among the 105 non-BAL QSOs selected resembling
the optical spectrum of J1259+1213, 44 cover the UV Fe II bump without narrow absorptions. The
light blue area in Figure 1 panel (b) shows the UV emission lines of these spectra. The observed
spectrum also lies above all these features. The excess could come from unobscured accretion disk.
This suggests that the absorber only covers part of the continuum source and little of the broad
emission-line region (BELR), as the latter is two orders of magnitude larger in size.

Removing the emission lines of optical template from observed ﬂux and normalizing the rest
by power-law continuum, we show the proﬁles of Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, and H10 in Figure 2 panel (a). The
normalized intensity is

I(v) = [1 − Cf (v)] + Cf (v)e−τ (v),

(1)

where Cf (v) is the covering factor and τ is true optical depth as functions of radial velocity.
For transitions from the same level of the given ion, the values of τ (v) are proportional to gf λ,
where g is the statistical weight, f is the oscillator strength, and λ is the rest wavelength of the
transition.

Applying Eq.1 to Hβ, Hγ, Hδ and H10, we can derive Cf (v) and τ (v) through the Balmer
troughs. The results are shown in Figure 2 panels (c) and (d). The integrated column density

– 6 –

on the hydrogen n = 2 shell through the proﬁle is 7.01 ± 0.54 × 1015 cm−2. By removing the
contribution of the predicted H8 absorption from the trough at rest-frame 3850 ˚Aand assuming
Cf (v) and fractional distribution τ (v)/ R τ (v) dv extracted from Balmer lines are also valid for He
I* λ3889, we derived that the column density on metastable He0 23S is 1.28 ± 0.09 × 1015 cm−2.

Ji et al.

(2015) presented a detailed investigation on the He I* ionization structure using
photoionization simulations. They found that if the irradiated medium is thick enough and the
ionizing front is well-developed, the strength of ionizing ﬂux (represented by ionization parameter
U ) at the illuminated surface can be solely determined by the column density of He I*. From the
Figure 10 in Ji et al. (2015), we obtain log U = −1.40 ± 0.05 for the BOSS spectrum.

To further constrain the physical properties of the absorber, other absorption lines in addition
to Balmer and He I* are required. A couple of weaker absorption features are detected in the
BOSS spectrum between the rest-frame 4200 and 5300 ˚A(see Figure 1, inset panel (c)), though
not seen in the SDSS spectrum due to the low S/N. The most credible ones are troughs at 4200,
4880, 4970, and 5120 ˚A, detected at a statistical signiﬁcance greater than 3σ. The strongest one
is at 5120 ˚A, having a proﬁle with FWHM > 1500 km s−1, which is comparable to the Balmer
absorption lines and suggests that it could be part of the intrinsic blueshifted system. If these lines
are associated with Balmer transitions, the rest-frame wavelengths are at 4233, 4924, 5018, and
5169 ˚Arespectively.

In fact, absorptions at these wavelengths have never been reported in the QSO spectra in
previous works. However, in other cases like extremely strong stellar wind, similar features have
been identiﬁed before. In the spectrum of emission-line star Hen 3-209, Naz´e et al. (2006) identiﬁed
a blueshifted Fe II absorption system associated with H I and He I, consisting of lines at rest
wavelengths 4233, 4549, 4584, 4924, 5018, 5169, 5276, and 5317 ˚A(see the inset panel (c) in Figure
1). These absorptions are also present in J1259+1213 but are too weak allowing for meaningful
measurements except lines at 4233 and 5169 ˚A. According to the atomic data from NIST1, we
identify these lines as arising from the excited levels of Fe+, with Eex varying from 2.58 to 3.20 eV.
The details are listed in Table 1.

These isolated optical Fe II lines are useful to better constrain the physical state of Fe+,
compared with the overlapping UV Fe II troughs. Assuming Fe II* λ4233 and λ5169 have the
same proﬁle as Balmer lines, we estimate that column densities are 4.31 ± 4.06 × 1015 cm−2 and
5.13 ± 1.29 × 1015 cm−2 for Fe+ b4P5/2 and a6S5/2 levels, respectively.

We use the photoionization code CLOUDY (version 10.00, last described by Ferland et al.
1998) to simulate the ionization process in the absorbing medium, assuming a slab-shaped geometry,
unique density, and homogeneous chemical composition of solar values. The incident spectral energy
distribution (SED) applied is a combination of a UV bump described as ναUVexp(−hν/kTBB)exp(−kTIR/hν)
and power-law aναX, incorporated in CLOUDY. This is considered typical for observed AGN con-

– 7 –

tinuum. The UV bump is parameterized by UV power-law index αUV = −0.5, and exponentially
cut oﬀ with temperature TBB = 1.5 × 105 K at high energy and kTIR = 0.01Ryd at infrared. The
power-law component has an index αX = −2 beyond 100 keV, and −1 between 1.36 eV and 100
keV. The overall ﬂux ratio of X-ray to optical is αOX = −1.4.

The resultant column densities on the hydrogen n = 2 shell and Fe+ excited levels as functions
of n(H) and Ncol(H) for ionizing ﬂux of log U = −1.4 are plotted in Figure 4, where the measured
values and uncertainties are presented in the colored areas. Our photoionization simulations suggest
that model with n(H) ∼ 109.1±0.1 cm−3 and Ncol(H) ∼ 1023.0±0.1 cm−2 is able to reproduce measured
column densities of Balmer and optical Fe II lines.

Ncol

The detailed Fe+ atomic model incorporated in CLOUDY can also predict column densities
on various levels contributing to the overlapping UV and optical Fe II absorption troughs between
2200 and 3300 ˚A. To check if the model result is consistent with UV Fe II, we need to generate a
synthetic spectrum. We assume that all individual absorption lines have the same proﬁle as Balmer
lines. This means, for a given Fe II transition, the ionic column density on the lower level predicted
by CLOUDY will be distributed to diﬀerent outﬂow velocities to evaluate the optical depth τFeII(v),
following the fractional column density distribution dNcol/dv
where dNcol/dv is proportional to τ (v)
from Balmer series. Then the eﬀect of partial covering in considered as fmodel = fem + fconti × (1 −
Cf + Cf e−τ ) to get the model ﬂux, where fem and fconti are unabsorbed ﬂuxes of emission lines
and continuum in J1259+1213 respectively. Since little is known about the unabsorbed UV ﬂux of
J1259+1213, we have to estimate it. An initial try is to use the best-ﬁtting SDSS QSO composite
spectrum shown in Figure 1 as an unabsorbed level. The resultant synthetic spectrum is plotted in
Figure 5 panel (a). The major features are reproduced, yet minor inconsistency is not negligible.
The main cause is that the unabsorbed ﬂux of J1259+1213 naturally diﬀers from the average.
A better method is required, like Leighly et al. (2011) deemed the best matched non-BAL QSO
spectrum as unabsorbed template to measure He I* λ10830 absorption. We employ the spectrum of
zem = 0.810 QSO SDSS J155635.81+160021.2 from the BOSS catalog as an unabsorbed template,
which best reproduces the observation when combined with the absorption model. The uncertainty
of the synthetic model spectrum includes the uncertainty introduced from photoionization model
parameters U , n(H), and Ncol(H) along with the uncertainty of the template. The latter is estimated
using the variance of the 44 non-BAL spectra which are selected to construct the optical template
and extend it to UV Fe II. In Figure 5 panel (b) we plot the synthetic spectrum and its uncertainty.
The model reproduces the observed spectrum better than the simple SDSS composite spectrum,
though there are still slight deviations at some wavelengths.

Based on the luminosity and SED of the ionizing continuum, we can derive the distance of the
= U n(H)cEph(< 912), where L(< 912) is the ionizing

absorbing gas to the central source as L(<912)

4πr2

abs

luminosity of the continuum source and Eph(< 912) is the average energy for all ionizing photons.
With the continuum ﬂux at 1215.67 ˚Afrom the best-ﬁtting SDSS composite spectrum presented in
Figure 1 and the incident model SED used in simulations, the extrapolated extinction-corrected
monochromatic luminosity of ionizing continuum in J1259+1213 at Lyman limit is Lν(912) =

– 8 –

9.8 × 1029 ergs−1Hz−1. Using this value as the unabsorbed continuum luminosity at 1 Ryd, we
obtain the L(< 912). Eph(< 912) is also evaluated according to SED. With log U = −1.4 and
log n(H)(cm−3) = 9.1 from the best-ﬁtting model, the distance of the inner surface of the absorbing
gas is rabs = 0.94 pc. The uncertainty of the distance introduced from U and n(H) is around 14%.
In addition, the distance also depends on the AGN ionizing luminosity, which is uncertain due to
the extrapolation of power-law continuum. A change of 100% for the luminosity can lead to a
change of 41% for distance, making it possibly the major source of uncertainty.

4. Variation of absorption from SDSS to BOSS

Based on the inferred physical conditions of the absorbing gas from Balmer, He I* and Fe II
lines in the BOSS spectrum, we can investigate the various scenarios responsible for the observed
BAL variations in detail.

We ﬁrst check for the possibility of the changes in incident continuum ﬂux, which would
aﬀect the ionization structure and alter the ionic column densities. The medium responds to
continuum variations in the recombination timescale (αne)−1, where α ≈ 4 × 10−13 cm−3s−1 is the
recombination coeﬃcient of H0. In J1259+1213, the absorber is so dense that the timescale is as
short as ∼ 2 × 103 s. Thus, the time interval between the SDSS and BOSS observations is long
enough to allow for the ionization state of the medium responding to any changes of ionizing ﬂux.

However, the variations of ionizing ﬂux should not change the geometry of the absorber (e.g.
the covering factor as a function of radial velocity). For Hβ absorption in the SDSS spectrum, if we
assume the distribution of covering factor is the same as that we derived from the BOSS data, the
optical depth of Hβ at vrad < −3000 km s−1, τ (v) = − ln Cf (v)−(1−I(v))
, becomes less than 1 as the
apparent depth (1 − I(v)) decreases (see dashed green line in Figure 2 panel (d)). The measured
n=2) = 2.31 ± 0.37 × 1015 cm−2, and Ncol(HeI∗) = 9.35 ± 0.91 × 1014 cm−2
column density is Ncol(H0
when the contribution of H8 is removed from the blended trough at rest-frame 3850 ˚Ain the SDSS
spectrum.

Cf (v)

The smaller column density of He I* means that the absorber is irradiated by the ionizing
ﬂux with log U = −1.60 ± 0.05 during the SDSS observation. If the changes in ionizing ﬂux are
assumed, the density and total column density of the medium should remain constant between
the SDSS and BOSS observations. Therefore, the physical parameters n(H) = 109.1±0.1 cm−3
and Ncol(H) = 1023.0±0.1 cm−2 derived from the BOSS spectrum should also be able to reproduce
SDSS observation. However, under the ionizing ﬂux of log U = −1.60 ± 0.05, the predicted column
n=2) = 5.8 ± 1.3 × 1015 cm−2, which is much larger than the measured value of
density is Ncol(H0
2.31 ± 0.37 × 1014 cm−2. It is least unlikely that the observed line variations are due to the changes
in ionization state of the absorbing gas.

Then we check for the alternative scenario in which the variations in BALs are mainly caused
by the movement of the absorber. In this case, the changes of the observed proﬁle between diﬀerent

– 9 –

epochs are due to the changed fraction of ionization source obscured by the medium or its sub-
structure.

In Figure 2 panel (c), we plot the covering factor as a function of radial velocity, derived as
Cf (v) = 1−I(v)
1−e−τ (v) , for Hβ absorption in the SDSS spectrum, assuming the optical depth does not
vary. In this case, the decrease of apparent depth directly indicates the decrease of covering factor.
On the other hand, we can apply Eq.1 to the multiple Balmer lines in the SDSS spectrum to derive
the optical depth and covering factor as we did for the BOSS data. The results are also presented
in Figure 2 as green solid lines. Despite the low S/N of the SDSS data, the measured covering
factor is nearly the same as that derived when assuming no change in optical depth (Figure 2
panel (c)) which is about a factor of 2 lower than that measured in the BOSS spectrum (red solid
line). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2 panel (d), the measured optical depth, though aﬀected
by the noise in the SDSS spectrum, is in good agreement with that measured from the BOSS data.
In contrast, the measured optical depth is clearly diﬀerent from that derived assuming constant
covering factor. This result strongly suggests the transverse movement of absorbing gas (and thus
the change of covering factor) as the origin for the observed BAL variability in J1259+1213.

The TripleSpec NIR data also support the picture of transverse movement. In Figure 3 middle
panel we plot the normalized Hα absorption spectrum. With the knowledge of optical depth and
covering factor as functions of radial velocity for Hβ in the BOSS spectrum, we can derive the
proﬁle of Hα absorption during the BOSS observation. We ﬁnd almost identical Hα proﬁle at
vrad > −3500 km s−1 during the TripleSpec observation. But at higher outward velocity nearly
all continuum ﬂux is absorbed. This can not be explained by the growth of column density as a
result of changes in ionizing ﬂux. Conversely, if we assume the covering factor at a higher velocity
continues to increases between the BOSS and TripleSpec observations (see Figure 3 bottom panel,
the absorber tends to obscure the whole continuum source at vrad < −3500 km s−1), the BAL
variability between SDSS-I, SDSS-III BOSS, and TripleSpec data can be easily understood.

Furthermore, we construct two synthetic spectra for UV Fe II absorption, one corresponding to
the scenario of changes in ionizing ﬂux, and the other for the changes in covering factor. In Figure
5 panel (c) we show the synthetic spectrum for the model with n(H) = 109.1 cm−3, Ncol(H) =
1023 cm−2 and unvaried covering factor, assuming only the incident ionizing ﬂux changes to log U =
−1.6. It can be seen that the predicted Fe II absorption troughs from 2600 to 3400 ˚Aare much deeper
than the observed ones. In fact, we test and ﬁnd that in case of changes only in the ionizing ﬂux, no
model can reproduce the observed BAL features in the SDSS spectrum. In Figure 5 panel (d), the
synthetic spectrum constructed, assuming a decrease in covering factor at v < −3000 km s−1, can
reproduce the SDSS data quite well. Note that except for the covering factor, the model parameters
are the same as those for the BOSS data. We thus attribute the BAL variability in J1259+1213 to
gaseous medium moving across our LOS, possibly related to a substantial outﬂowing structure.

5. Discussion

The mass of central SMBH can be derived using the relation log(MBH/106 M⊙) = (1.39 ±
0.14) + 0.5 log(L5100/1044 erg s−1) + (1.09 ± 0.23) log[FWHM(Hβ)/1000 km s−1] from Wang et al.
(2009). L5100 is the monochromatic AGN luminosity at the rest-frame 5100 ˚Awhich is 1.54 ± 0.07 ×
1045 erg s−1 for J1259+1213, and FWHM(Hβ) is the full width at half maximum for broad Hβ
emission component. Since in the spectra of J1259+1213 the broad absorption troughs superimpose
the blue wing of Balmer peaks, we use the unabsorbed template shown in Figure 1 (panel (f)) to
extract the proﬁle of Balmer lines. The Hβ is modeled using one Gaussian proﬁle for narrow
emission and three Gaussians for broad emission. The resulting FWHM for the whole broad Hβ
component is 3631 km s−1. Therefore, we obtain MBH = 4.0 ± 1.7 × 108 M⊙. Adopting the
correction factor by Runnoe et al. (2012), the bolometric luminosity is Lbol = (8.1 ± 0.4) × L5100 =
1.25 ± 0.08 × 1046 erg s−1. Assuming an accretion eﬃciency of 0.1, the mass accretion rate is then
˙MBH ≈ 2.2 M⊙ yr−1.

eﬀ = 3GM ˙M

The radius of the accretion disk that eﬀectively contributes to the continuum radiation at 4863
˚Acan be estimated from σT 4
8πR3 f (R, a) (Eq. 2 in Collin et al. 2002). With kBTeﬀ = hν
and the boundary condition f (R, a) ≈ 1, we obtain R(4863) = 2.7 × 1015 cm. If the increase of a
covering factor at vrad ≈ −3700 km s−1 from 0.2 during the SDSS observation to 0.6 during the
BOSS observation stands for a continuous movement of absorber across our LOS, the transverse
velocity is v⊥ ≈ 1.8×102 km s−1, which is much smaller than the Keplerian velocity 1.4×103 km s−1
at rabs (∼ 0.94 pc).

In the model where the outﬂow is accelerated radially, the conservation of angular momentum
is suggested, v⊥ ∝ r−1. Therefore, we ﬁnd that at a smaller distance, req ≈ 4.8 × 1016 cm, the
extrapolated rotational velocity equals the Keplerian velocity which varies as r−0.5. Since the
largest transverse velocity is detected at an outward velocity of ∼ 3700 km s−1, the corresponding
absorbing gas may locate around the illuminated surface of the outﬂow, closer to the center than
the gas at a lower outward velocity. Therefore, it seems that the outﬂow arises from the surface
of the inner disk at req, being accelerated radially up to 3700 ∼ 4000 km s−1, the largest outward
velocity we detect in the absorption troughs, at around 1 pc, and then gradually being decelerated.
The distance corresponding to the largest outward velocity is close to the evaporation radius of
Revap = 1.3L1/2
1500 pc ≈ 0.77 pc (Barvainis 1987), where LUV,46 is the UV luminosity in unit of
1046erg s−1 which is approximated using λLλ(1450), and T1500 is the grain evaporation temperature
in unit of 1500 K which is ≈ 1. The deceleration could be due to the collision with the surrounding
interstellar medium. This picture is consistent with the suggestion that LoBAL QSOs may represent
the transition from obscured star-forming galaxies to classic QSOs when the outﬂow blows away
the dusty envelope (Canalizo & Stockton 2001, Di Matteo et al. 2005).

UV,46T −2.8

The mass of an individual outﬂow element can be estimated as Mabs = µmpNcol(H)S, where
µ is the mean atomic mass per proton, mp is the mass of proton, and S is the projection area of
the absorber. Its dynamic timescale can be approximated as 2rabs/vrad,max. Assuming all wind

elements have similar physical properties, the total mass outﬂow rate can be expressed as the sum
Pi Si. If these

Ω cannot be derived directly from the observation of J1259+1213. However, we can give a
rough estimate for Ω according to the detection fraction of BAL QSOs, which is suggested ∼ 40%
by considering the spectroscopic incompleteness and selection bias (Allen et al. 2011). Thus, we
obtain ˙Mwind ≈ 10 M⊙ yr−1. The kinetic energy carried by the wind is ˙Ek = 1

6. Summary

J1259+1213 is a rare QSO hosting blueshifted BALs of Fe II, H I Balmer series and metastable
He I. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant variations of the absorption proﬁles among the SDSS, BOSS and TripleSpec
spectra which were taken over a timescale of 5.8 years in the QSO’s frame. In the BOSS spectrum,
the Balmer series, the He I* line, and the optical Fe II absorptions, which were ﬁrst identiﬁed in
the spectra of QSOs, have been reliably measured and the physical conditions of the absorber can
be well-constrained using the photoionization simulations. This allows us to explore the dominant
mechanism causing the observed BAL variations. It is demonstrated that the changes in the ionizing
ﬂux of the absorber alone cannot reproduce the variability. Conversely, assuming an increase in
the covering factor of the absorption at higher outﬂowing velocity can consistently explain the
BAL variations. This leads us to conclude that the BAL variability in J1259+1213 is due to the
movement of absorbing gas across LOS to the central source.

cyan line is the SDSS QSO composite spectrum (Vanden Berk et al. 2001) that can best-ﬁt the
observation longward of 3770 ˚Ain the QSO’s rest-frame, reddened with SMC-type extinction curve
(Gordon et al. 2003) with E(B −V ) = 0.187, and the light green line shows the reddened power-law
continuum. The lowest eight terms of Fe+ accounting for the overlapping UV Fe II troughs are
labeled, with the wavelengths dominated by the ground term (dark gray) and terms higher than
b4P (light gray) being emphasized by shadowed areas. The dark green line below is the UV emission
of the SDSS composite spectrum, while the light blue area shows the range of UV emission of the
spectra used to construct the unabsorbed optical template. The absorption features detected at
rest-frame ∼ 4233, 4924, 5018 and 5169 ˚Aare identiﬁed as Fe II lines from highly excited levels
according to the absorption system associated with stellar wind in emission-line star Hen 3-209

compared with the observed UV Fe II and Balmer absorptions. Besides H I, He I*, and Fe II, the
contributions from Mg I, Mg II, Ti II, Cr II, Mn II, Co II, and Ni II are also included. All transitions
are assumed to have the same proﬁle as Balmer lines. Since in rest-frame UV band, little is known
about the unabsorbed spectrum of J1259+1213 due to the overlapping UV Fe II troughs, we use the
SDSS QSO composite spectrum (cyan line) to estimate the unabsorbed level ﬁrst (see panel (a)).
In the following panels, the spectrum of SDSS J155635.81+160021.2 (blue lines in the left half of
all panels) is employed as unabsorbed UV template and reddened using SMC-type extinction law.
In panels (a) and (b), the model best-ﬁtting the BOSS observation is plotted. Panel (c) exhibits
the synthetic model spectrum assuming that the absorber during the SDSS observation has the
same n(H), Ncol(H) and covering factor as that during the BOSS while ionizing ﬂux is U = 10−1.6.
In panel (d), we show the model spectrum assuming the absorber at the SDSS observation has the
same physical properties (U , n(H) and Ncol(H)) as that in the BOSS while the covering factor at
high outward velocity changes. The uncertainty of the template is evaluated using the variance
of non-BAL spectra employed to construct optical template, and is plotted in light blue. The
uncertainty of synthetic model spectra (in orange) includes the uncertainty of the template and the
uncertainty from photoionization simulation parameters U , n(H), and Ncol(H). It is clear that the
scenario of the moving absorber rather than changing ionizing ﬂux can explain the variations.
