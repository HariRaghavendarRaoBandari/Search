CONSTRUCTION OF SCHEMOIDS FROM POSETS

NUMATA, YASUHIDE

Abstract. A schemoid is a generalization of association schemes from the
point of view of small categories. In this article, we discuss schemoid structures
for two kinds of small categories; the canonical small category deﬁned by
a poset, and another small category which arises a poset. We also discuss
the schemoid algebra, that is an analogue of the Bose–Mesner algebra for an
association scheme, for them.

1. Introduction

Association schemes are introduced by Bose and Shimamoto [3] in their study of
design of experiments. Since we can regard association schemes as a generalization
of combinatorial designs, groups, and so on (see also [1]), many authors study asso-
ciation schemes from the view point of algebraic combinatorics. Bose and Mesner
introduced an algebra which arises an association scheme [2]. The algebra is called
the Bose–Mesner algebra, and plays an important role for algebraic study for asso-
ciation schemes. In [5], Kuribayashi and Matsuo introduced a schemoid, which is a
pair of a small category and a partition of its morphisms satisfying some conditions
for cardinality (see Section 2 for the deﬁnition). We can identify an association
scheme with a schemoid. They also introduce a subalgebra of the category algebra
which arises a schemoid. The algebra is an analogue of the Bose–Mesner algebra
for an association scheme. Kuribayashi [4] and Kuribayashi–Momose [6] develop
homotopy theory for schemoids.

The purpose of this article is to give examples of schemoids. First we discuss
schemoid structure for a small category without nontrivial endomorphisms. Then,
as application of our key theorem, we discuss schemoid structures for two kinds of
small categories; the canonical small category obtained from a poset, and another
acyclic small category obtained from a poset. The organization of this article is the
following: We deﬁne schemoids and schemoid algebras in Section 2. In Section 3, we
discuss schemoid structures on small categories without nontrivial endomorphisms,
and show the key theorem (Theorem 3.2). We discuss schemoid structures on two
kinds of small categories which arises a poset in Section 4.

2. Definition

Here we recall the deﬁnition of small categories, schemoids and schemoid alge-

bras.

First we recall small categories and functors. A small category C is a quintuple
of the set Obj(C) of objects, the set Mor(C) of morphisms, maps s : Mor(C) →
Obj(C) and t : Mor(C) → Obj(C), and the operation ◦ of composition, satisfying the
following properties: For each morphism f ∈ Mor(C), s(f ) is called the source of f ,
and t(f ) is called the target of f . A morphism f is called an endomorphism if s(f ) =
t(f ). For x, y ∈ Obj(C), deﬁne HomC(x, y) = { f ∈ Mor(C) | s(f ) = x, t(f ) = y }.

A sequence (fn, fn−1, . . . , f1) of morphisms is called a nerve if t(fi) = s(fi+1) for
i = 1, . . . , n − 1. The composition g ◦ f is deﬁned for each nerve (g, f ) of length
2. The composition g ◦ f is in HomC(x, z) for g ∈ HomC(y, z) and f ∈ HomC(x, y).
Moreover the operation satisﬁes (h ◦ g) ◦ f = h ◦ (g ◦ f ) for every nerve (h, g, f ) of
length 3. For x ∈ Obj(C), a morphism from x to x is called an endomorphism on
x. For each x ∈ Obj(C), there uniquely exists an endomorphism idx on x such that
idx ◦f = f for every f with t(f ) = x and g ◦ idx = g for every g with s(g) = x.
The morphism idx is called the identity on x. For a morphism f ∈ HomC(x, y), a
morphism g ∈ HomC(y, x) is called the inverse of f if g ◦ f = idx and f ◦ g = idy.
If there exists the inverse of f , then the inverse of f is unique, and the inverse of f
is denoted by f −1.

Let C and C ′ be small categories. We call a pair ϕ = (ϕObj, ϕMor) a functor from
C to C ′ if the map ϕObj from Obj(C) to Obj(C ′) and the map ϕMor from Mor(C) to
Mor(C ′) satisfy the following:

(1) ϕMor(idx) = idϕObj(x) for each x ∈ Obj(C).
(2) ϕMor(f ◦ g) = ϕMor(f ) ◦ ϕMor(g) for all nerve (f, g) of length 2 in C.
Next we deﬁne schemoids.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let C be a small category, I a set, and l a map from the set
Mor(C) of morphisms in C to the set I. For i, j ∈ I and h ∈ Mor(C), we deﬁne N i,j
h
to be




(f, g) ∈ Mor(C) × Mor(C)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

l(f ) = i,
l(g) = j,
f ◦ g = h.

.




We call the triple (C, I, l) a schemoid if

l(h) = l(k) =⇒ N i,j

h ≃ N i,j

k

as sets for each i, j ∈ I and h, k ∈ Mor(C).

Remark 2.2. We call a pair of a ﬁnite set X and a partition S = { R0, R1, . . . , Rn }
of X × X an n-class association scheme if S satisﬁes the following:

(1) R0 = { (x, x) | x ∈ X }.
(2) If R ∈ S, then { (y, x) | (x, y) ∈ R } ∈ S.
(3) For i, j, k ∈ { 0, 1, . . . , n }, there exists pk

i,j such that

pk
i,j = # { ((x, y), (y, z)) ∈ Ri × Rj }

for every (x, z) ∈ Rk.

The numbers pk
i,j are called structural constants. Let (X, S = { R0, R1, . . . , Rn }) be
an n-class association scheme. Consider the small category C such that Obj(C) = X
and HomC(x, y) = { (y, x) }. For a nerve ((x, y), (y, z)), deﬁne (x, y)◦(y, z) = (x, z).
Let l be a map from Obj(C) to I = { 0, 1, . . . , n } deﬁned by l((x, y)) = i for
(x, y) ∈ Ri. Since an association scheme satisﬁes Condition 3, the triple (C, I, l) is
a schemoid.

Remark 2.3. A schemoid in this article is called a quasi-schemoid in Kuribayashi–
Matsuo [5]. In the paper, a schemoid is deﬁned to be a pair of small category C
and a partition S of the morphisms satisfying the following:

{ (f, g) ∈ σ × τ | f ◦ g = h } ≃ { (f, g) ∈ σ × τ | f ◦ g = k }

as sets for σ, τ , µ ∈ S and h, k ∈ µ. For a schemoid (C, S) in the sense of the paper,
we have a map l from Mor(C) to S deﬁned by l(f ) = Ri for f ∈ Ri ∈ S. We obtain
a schemoid (C, S, l) in the sense of this article from a schemoid (C, S) in the sense of

the paper. For a schemoid (C, I, l) in this article, the pair (C,(cid:8) l

is a schemoid in the paper. Hence the deﬁnition in this article is equivalent to the
deﬁnition in the paper.

Remark 2.4. A schemoid requires the condition which is analogue of the condition
for the structural constant of an association scheme, i.e., Condition 3 in Remark
2.2. Kuribayashi and Matsuo also introduce an association schemoid, which is a
schemoid satisfying the other conditions in the deﬁnition of an association scheme.

For a small category C and a ﬁeld K, deﬁne K[C] to be the K-vector space whose

basis is Mor(C). We deﬁne the product by

g · f =(g ◦ f

0

s(g) = t(f )
s(g) 6= t(f )

for f, g ∈ Mor(C). Moreover, for Pf ∈Mor(C) αf f and Pg∈Mor(C) βgg ∈ K[C], we

deﬁne the product of them by

l be a map from Mor(C) to a set I. Assume that l

If Obj(C) is a ﬁnite set, then K[C] is a K-algebra with the unit Px∈Obj(C) idx. Let
i ∈ I. For i ∈ I, we deﬁne i to be Pf : l(f )=i f ∈ K[C]. We deﬁne K(C, I, l) to
be the vector subspace of K[C] spanned by (cid:8) i(cid:12)(cid:12) i ∈ I (cid:9). For a schemoid (C, I, l)

−1({ i }) is ﬁnite for every i ∈ I, K(C, I, l) is a subalgebra of K[C]. (The
such that l
subalgebra K(C, I, l) may not have the unit.) We call K(C, I, l) a schemoid algebra.

−1({ i }) is ﬁnite for every

Remark 2.5. Let (X = { 1, . . . , m } , S = { R0, R1, . . . , Rn }) be an n-class associa-
tion scheme. For Rk, we deﬁne an m × m-matrix Dk = (d(k)

x,y)x,y∈X by

(d(k)

x,y) =(1 ((x, y) ∈ Rk)

0 ((x, y) 6∈ Rk).

The matrix Dk is called the adjacency matrix for the relation Rk. By Condition
1, D0 is the unit matrix. Let A(X, S) be the complex vector space spanned by
i,jDk. Hence A(X, S) is a
subalgebra of the matrix algebra. The algebra A(X, S) is called the Bose–Mesner
algebra for (X, S). A schemoid algebra for a schemoid is an analogue of Bose–
Mesner algebra for an association scheme.

Remark 2.6. Let C be a small category such that Mor(C) is ﬁnite, and l a map
from Mor(C) to I. The vector subspace K(C, I, l) of K[C] is a subalgebra of K[C]
(which may not have a unit) if and only if (C, I, l) is a schemoid. The schemoid
algebra K(C, I, l) of K[C] has a unit if and only if there exists a subset I0 ⊂ I such
−1(I0) = { idx | x ∈ Obj(C) }. We call a schemoid (C, I, l) a unital schemoid
that l
if there exists a subset I0 such that l

−1(I0) = { idx | x ∈ Obj(C) }.

3. Key Theorem

Let C be a small category. Here we assume that C does not contain any endo-
morphism except identities. Or equivalently, we assume that HomC(x, x) = { idx }
for each x ∈ Obj(C). For a morphism f ∈ C, we write Cf to denote the subcategory
of C such that

Mor(Cf ) = { g ∈ Mor(C) | f1 ◦ g ◦ f2 = f for some f1, f2 ∈ Mor(C) }
Obj(Cf ) = { x ∈ Obj(C) | idx ∈ Mor(Cf ) } .

A morphism in Cf is a morphism appearing in some nerves whose composition is
f . Since idt(f ) ◦f ◦ ids(f ) = f , the morphism f is in Cf . Since f ◦ ids(f ) ◦ ids(f ) = f

4

Y. NUMATA

and idt(f ) ◦ idt(f ) ◦f = f , the identities ids(f ) and idt(f ) are also in Cf . An object
in Cf is the source or target of some morphisms in Cf .

Theorem 3.1. Let C be a small category which does not contain any endomorphism
except identities. Let l be a map from the set Mor(C) of morphisms to a set I. If
the following condition holds, then (C, I, l) is a schemoid: For all morphisms f and
g such that l(f ) = l(g), there exists a functor ϕf,g from Cf to Cg such that

is a bijection;

(1) ϕMor
f,g
(2) l(f ′) = l(ϕMor
(3) ϕMor

f,g (f ) = g.

f,g (f ′)) for each morphism f ′ in Cf ; and

Proof. Let h, k ∈ Mor(C) satisfy l(h) = l(k). The map ϕMor
from N i,j

for each i, j ∈ I. Hence the triple (C, I, l) is a schemoid.

h,k induces a bijection
(cid:3)

h to N i,j

k

We say that C is acyclic if the following hold:
(1) HomC(x, x) = { idx } for each x ∈ Obj(C).
(2) If HomC(x, y) 6= ∅ and x 6= y, then HomC(y, x) = ∅.

If C is acyclic, then Condition 3 always holds. Hence we have the following:

Theorem 3.2. Let C be an acyclic small category, and l a map from Mor(C) to
I. If the following condition holds, then (C, I, l) is a schemoid: For all morphisms
f and g such that l(f ) = l(g), there exists a functor ϕf,g from Cf to Cg such that

(1) ϕMor
f,g
(2) l(f ′) = l(ϕMor

is a bijection; and

f,g (f ′)) for each morphism f ′ in Cf .

4. Application

Here we consider two kinds of small categories deﬁned from a poset. The proto-
typical example of them is a schemoid structure for the n-th Boolean lattice 2[n],
i.e., the poset consisting of all subsets of { 1, . . . , n } ordered by inclusion. For
X, Y ∈ 2[n], we can consider the set diﬀerence X \ Y . In 4.1, we discuss a poset
with the operation which is analogue of the operation of set diﬀerence. The oper-
ation induces a schemoid structure for the canonical small category obtained from
the poset. On the other hand, for X, Y ∈ 2[n] with X ∩ Y = ∅, a greater element
X ∪ Y than X is obtained from X by adding Y . By an analogue of the operation,
we introduce an acyclic small category obtained from a poset with some conditions
in 4.2. The category has also a schemoid structure.

4.1. Posets as a small category. Let P be a poset with respect to ≤. For
x, y ∈ P , we deﬁne the interval [x, y] from x to y by [x, y] = { z | x ≤ z ≤ y }.
We can naturally regard the poset P as the following small category CP : the set
Obj(CP ) of objects is P and the set Mor(CP ) of morphisms is the relation ≥, i.e.,
{ (y, x) | x ≤ y } ⊂ P × P . For x ≤ y ∈ P , HomCP (x, y) consists of (y, x). For
(y, x) ∈ HomCP (x, y) and (z, y) ∈ HomCP (y, z), it follows by deﬁnition that x ≤ z.
We deﬁne the composition (z, y) ◦ (y, x) by (z, y) ◦ (y, x) = (z, x). For x ∈ P , idx is
(x, x). The category CP is acyclic.

Here we consider a poset P with a diﬀerence operation δ deﬁned as follows:

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let o be an element in the poset P , and δ a map from the set

(cid:8) (y, x) ∈ P 2 (cid:12)(cid:12) x ≤ y(cid:9) to P . We say that δ is a diﬀerence operation with the base

point o if there exists a family

{ ϕx,y : [x, y] → [o, δ(y, x)] | x ≤ y }

of maps satisfying the following:

(1) Each ϕx,y is a bijection from the interval [x, y] to the interval [o, δ(y, x)].

CONSTRUCTION OF SCHEMOIDS

5

(2) δ(o, ϕx,y(z)) = δ(x, z) for x ≤ z ≤ y.

Remark 4.2. Let δ be a diﬀerence operation of poset P .
In this case, we have
bijections ϕx,y. If we ﬁx an interval [x, y], then we can translate each element in
the interval [x, y] into some interval from the base point o via the bijection ϕx,y.
Fix x ∈ P and consider two intervals [x, y] and [x, y′]. For z ∈ [x, y] ∩ [x, y′], it
follows by Condition 2 that δ(o, ϕx,y(z)) = δ(o, ϕx,y′ (z)). In this sense, Condition 2
implies that the translation depends not on the interval but only on the minimum
of the interval.

Since the diﬀerence operation induces functors ϕf,g from (CP )f to (CP )g, Theo-

rem 4.3 follows from Theorem 3.2.

Theorem 4.3. For a poset P with the diﬀerence operation δ, the triple (CP , P, δ)
is a schemoid.

Example 4.4. Let P be the n-th Boolean lattice, i.e., 2[n] ordered by inclusion. For
x ≤ y ∈ P , we deﬁne δ(y, x) to be y \ x. The map δ is a diﬀerence operation with
the base point ∅. Hence (CP , P, δ) is a schemoid. In this case, the schemoid algebra
K(CP , P, δ) is isomorphic to K[xi|i ∈ P ]/(x2

i |i ∈ P ).

Example 4.5. Let P be a Coxeter groups ordered by the Bruhat order. For x ≤
y ∈ P , we deﬁne δ(y, x) to be yx−1. The map δ is a diﬀerence operation with the
base point ε. Hence (CP , P, δ) is a schemoid. In this case, the schemoid algebra
K(CP , P, δ) is isomorphic to the NilCoxeter algebra.

Example 4.6. Let ∆ be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V . Consider the
lattice P of faces of the simplicial complex ∆. (We regard ∅ as a face of ∆.) For
x, y ∈ P , we deﬁne δ(y, x) to be y \ x. The map δ is a diﬀerence operation with the
base point o = ∅. Hence (CP , P, δ) is a schemoid. Let I∆ be an ideal of K[xi|i ∈ V ]
generated by { xv1 · · · xvl | { v1, . . . , vl } 6∈ ∆ }. The quotient ring K[xi|i ∈ V ]/I∆ is
called the Stanley–Reisner ring. Let ˜I∆ = I∆ + (x2
i |i ∈ V ). The schemoid algebra
K(CP , P, δ) is isomorphic to K[xi|i ∈ V ]/ ˜I∆.

Remark 4.7. In Appendix of [6], Kuribayashi and Momose discuss schemoids in
Example 4.6 from the point of view of the category theory.

4.2. Yet another small category obtained from posets. Here we introduce
another kind of small categories obtained from a poset. We also introduce a
schemoid structure for it.

Let P be a poset with respect to ≤. Assume that the number of minimal elements
in { z ∈ P | x, y ≤ z } is 1 or 0 for each pair x, y ∈ P . We write x ∨ y to denote
the minimum element in { z ∈ P | x, y ≤ z } if { z ∈ P | x, y ≤ z } 6= ∅. Assume the
following conditions:

(1) P has the minimum element ˆ0.
(2) P is a ranked poset with the rank function ρ.
(3) ρ(x ∨ y) ≤ ρ(x) + ρ(y) for x, y ∈ P .

We deﬁne a small category ˜P whose set of objects is P . For x, y, d ∈ P such that
ρ(y) = ρ(x) + ρ(d) and y = x ∨ d, we deﬁne a morphism f d
x,y from x to y. Or
equivalently,

y,z ∈ Mor( ˜P ), then ρ(y) = ρ(x) + ρ(c) and ρ(z) =
for x, y ∈ P .
ρ(y) + ρ(d). Hence ρ(z) = ρ(x) + ρ(c) + ρ(d). Since z = x ∨ (c ∨ d), we have

If f c

d ∈ P.

y = x ∨ d.

ρ(y) = ρ(x) + ρ(d).

In this case, we have d = d1∨d2 and ρ(d) = ρ(d1)+ρ(d2). If ρ(x′∨d1) < ρ(x′)+ρ(d1)
or ρ(x′ ∨ d1 ∨ d2) < ρ(x′ ∨ d1) + ρ(d2), then we have

ρ(x′ ∨ d1 ∨ d2) < ρ(x′) + ρ(d1) + ρ(d2)

G′

G2 = { XxXy − Xx∨y | ρ(x ∨ y) = ρ(x) + ρ(y) } .

Let I be the ideal generated by G0 ∪ G1 ∪ G′
1 ∪ G2, and RP the quotient ring
K[Xx|x ∈ P ]/I. The ring RP is the same as the ring deﬁned in the following

Assume that P satisﬁes the conditions in this section. In this case, the schemoid
algebra for ( ˜P , P, l) is isomorphic to the algebra deﬁned in Maeno–Numata [7],
which is M¨obius algebra with the relations x2
