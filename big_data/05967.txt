In 2006, a novel superalloy, Co3(Al, W), was discovered [1]. This cobalt-based alloy has better
mechanical properties than the conventional nickel-based superalloys. Inspired by this unexpected
discovery, we performed a ﬁrst-principles search through 2224 ternary metallic systems of the form
X3[A0.5, B0.5], where X = Ni, Co, or Fe, and [A, B] = Li, Be, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, W, Re,
Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, or Tl—combinations of 41 diﬀerent elements chosen from the periodic table.
We found 179 systems that are simultaneously more stable and have a lower formation enthalpy
than the Co3(Al, W) superalloy. These new candidates, narrowed from thousands of possibilities,
suggest experimental exploration with a high probability of identifying new superalloys. Of these 179
systems, 76 are “brand new”—no reported phase diagrams. Based on cost, experimental diﬃculty,
and toxicity, we limit these 76 to a shorter list of 21 promising candidates for further study, with
three of immediate interest. Our calculations are consistent with current experimental literature
where data exists.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Material scientists have developed huge experimental
databases of known materials over the last century [2–
5]. Similar computational databases are being compiled
by exploiting the power of supercomputers and advanced
electronic structure methods [6–11]. The challenge now
is to leverage the data to discover new materials with
model building [12] and machine learning [13–16]. Data
mining and materials informatics approaches can also be
used to identify structure/property relationships, which
may suggest atomic combinations, stoichiometries, and
structures not included in the database [12].

But even simple searches through the data can iden-
tify new phases [12]. An emerging area in materials sci-
ence is computational prediction of new materials using
high-throughput approaches [6, 12–14, 17–21]. Hundreds
of thousands of hypothetical candidates can be explored
much faster than by experimental means. In this work,
a simple combinatorial search for ternary superalloys is
performed in a high-throughput fashion. The extraordi-
nary mechanical properties of superalloys at high temper-
atures make them useful for many important applications
in the aerospace and power generation industries. One
of the basic traits of superalloys is that they generally
occur in a face-centered-cubic structure [22]. The most
common base elements for superalloys are nickel, cobalt,
and iron, but most are nickel-based.
In 2006, samples
of a new cobalt-based superalloy Co3(Al,W) were con-
ﬁrmed to have better mechanical properties than many
nickel-based superalloys [1].

This cobalt-based superalloy has

the commonly-
occurring L12 phase which creates coherent precipi-
tates. A theoretical investigation of the Co3(Al,W) was
subsequently carried out by Saal and Wolverton [23].
They used an L12-based special quasirandom structure
(SQS) [24] to mimic its properties at high temperatures.
In order to identify the stoichiometry of the superalloy,
they performed ﬁrst-principles calculations for diﬀerent
SQS structures of the form Co3[Alx,W1−x] with vary-
ing concentrations of Al and W. Their study includes
ﬁnite temperature eﬀects and point defect energetics.
Their results show that an L12-like random structure
with stoichiometry Co3[Al0.5,W0.5] is consistent with ex-
periment. Interestingly, the SQS-L12 Co3[Al0.5,W0.5] is
metastable and predicted to have a decomposition en-
ergy of 66 meV/atom (distance from the T = 0 K convex
hull). They show that high temperature eﬀects make this
phase thermodynamically competitive with other com-
peting structures at elevated temperatures. The fact that
a metastable structure (Co3[Al0.5,W0.5]) with a decom-
position energy as high as 66 meV/atom, is competitive
with many commercially-available superalloys motivates
our search for similar ternary systems containing an L12-
like solid solution phase.

Ideally, a computational search over potential super-
alloys would model actual engineering observables (e.g.
hardness) and include the inﬂuence of small concentra-
tions of impurities, ﬁnite temperature eﬀects, inﬂuence of
vacancies, eﬀects of polycrystallinity, etc. Unfortunately,
such calculations are extremely challenging even for a
single material and practically impossible for thousands
of candidate systems as in this work.
Instead, we use
material properties such as formation enthalpy, relative
stability at T = 0 K, and bulk modulus as coarse metrics
to identify new candidate alloys.

Using the SQS-32 structure identiﬁed by Saal and

FIG. 1. For each base element in X3[A0.5, B0.5], there are
40 elements chosen for A and B, which includes 38 elements
(highlighted in blue) chosen from the periodic table and the
remaining two of three base elements X (highlighted in red).

Wolverton [23], we performed an extensive combinato-
rial search over 2224 ternary systems using the Aflow
framework [7, 8]. We found 179 systems that are more
stable (closer to T = 0 K convex hull) and have a lower
formation enthalpy than the Co3[Al0.5,W0.5] superalloy.
Of these systems, 76 are “brand new”—no reported phase
diagrams [4, 5]. These new candidates, narrowed from
thousands of possibilities, suggest experimental explo-
ration with a high probability of identifying new super-
alloys. Furthermore, by eliminating those systems that
are experimentally diﬃcult to make or contain expensive
or toxic elements, we identify 21 particularly promising
systems.

II. METHODOLOGY

FIG. 2. The 32-atom special quasirandom structure (SQS-
32) [25] used to perform all calculations in this work. It is
an L12-based structure (smaller cube in the ﬁgure). The
blue, red, and green atoms correspond to X, A, and B in
X3[A0.5, B0.5], respectively.

The special quasirandom structure (SQS) [24] ap-
proach mimics the statistics of a random alloy in a small
supercell [36]. Fig. 2 depicts the 32-atom SQS [25] that
was used for all calculations in this work. It is an L12-
based structure where X atoms (blue) are on the face
centers of the conventional fcc cell and A (red), B (green)
on the corners.

First-principles structure calculations

Thermodynamic property calculations

We performed ﬁrst principles calculations using the
software package Aflow [7].
A 32-atom special
quasirandom structure (SQS-32) [23–25] of the form
X3[A0.5, B0.5] was used, where X is one of the base ele-
ments, nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co) or iron (Fe) (refer Fig. 1).
The combinations lead to 780 diﬀerent ternary structures
for each base element totaling to 2340 SQS-32 structures
in 2224 diﬀerent ternary systems.

All the calculations follow the Aflow [26] standard,
are hosted in the Aflowlib repository [8], and can be
automatically accessed by using the RESTfulAPI [27].
Each ab-initio calculation is performed using PAW po-
tentials [28–30] within the GGA of Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof [31, 32], as implemented in VASP [33, 34].
The k-point meshes for sampling the Brillouin zone are
constructed using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme [35]. A
total number of at least 10,000 k-points per reciprocal
atom are used, and spin polarization [26] is considered.
The cutoﬀ energy is chosen to be 1.4 times the default
maximum value of the three elements in the respective
ternary system. More details are available in Ref. [26].

The formation enthalpy (∆Hf ) is calculated for any

ternary structure X3[A0.5, B0.5] as

∆Hf = E (X3 [A0.5, B0.5]) −(cid:88)m

Em,

where E (X3 [A0.5, B0.5]) is the total energy per atom of

the SQS-32–X3[A0.5, B0.5] structure, and(cid:80)m Em is the

sum of formation energies of corresponding stable, pure
concentration structures. A negative formation enthalpy
characterizes a stable system, one that prefers its con-
ﬁguration over decomposition into its pure constituents.
Unstable systems have a positive formation enthalpy.

To approximate the phase diagram of a given alloy
system, we consider the low-temperature limit in which
the behavior of the system is dictated by the ground
state [37, 38]. In compositional space, the set of ground
state conﬁgurations deﬁnes the minimum energy surface,
also referred to as the lower-half convex hull. All com-
pounds above the minimum energy surface are unstable,
with the decomposition described by the hull member or

Ni3/Co3/Fe3[A0.5, B0.5] structure, where A and B are any two diﬀerent elements in the periodic table from Fig. 1. Co-
based and Fe-based systems are displaced on the x-axis by 200 meV and 400 meV, respectively, for clarity. Ni-based, Co-based,
and Fe-based systems are marked in blue, red, and green triangles, respectively. Systems enclosed within dotted lines are the
ones identiﬁed to be better than the Co3[Al0.5,W0.5] with respect to these properties.

facet directly below each. The energy gained from this
decomposition is geometrically represented by the dis-
tance of the compound from the hull and quantiﬁes the
compound’s tendency to decompose. We refer to this
quantity as the decomposition energy (Ed).

While the minimum energy surface changes at ﬁ-
nite temperature (favoring disordered structures), we ex-
pect the T = 0 K decomposition energy to serve as
a reasonable descriptor for relative stability. The sta-
ble unary/binary structures considered for the phase di-
agrams are limited to those existing in Aflowlib [8].
The ternary convex hulls and relevant calculations were
performed [39] using the phase diagram module within
Aflow [7] (see Appendix for details).

The properties that identify a material as a superal-
loy are a combination of stability and good mechanical
strength. While stability is determined directly with Ed,
good mechanical strength is diﬃcult to quantify entirely.
Instead, we consider the magnitude of ∆Hf as a descrip-
tor for bond strength. Any structure for which Ed and
∆Hf is less than that of the SQS-32–Co3[Al0.5,W0.5] is
included in our list of potential candidates.

Bulk modulus calculations

The bulk modulus is calculated from energy-volume
data calculated for strains of −0.02 ˚A to +0.02 ˚A in steps
of 0.01 ˚A applied to the unit cell, with at least ﬁve calcu-
lations for each system. The energy-volume data is ﬁtted
using the Murnaghan equation of state [40].

III. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

Relative stability of SQS-32 and the distance to convex hull

Fig. 3 depicts the formation enthalpy (∆Hf ) vs. de-
composition energy (Ed) for all 2224 SQS-32 ternary sys-
tems with composition distinguished by color. It is found
that 2111/2224 ternary systems are compound-forming.
Each point on the plot represents one Ni3/Co3/Fe3(A, B)
system, where A and B are any two diﬀerent elements
highlighted in Fig. 1. On average, Ni-based superalloys
are thermodynamically more stable than Co- or Fe-based
superalloys. This is consistent with the fact that most
commercial superalloys are nickel-based.

The SQS-32 structure in 179 ternary systems is found
to be thermodynamically more stable and have lower for-
mation enthalpy than the Co3(Al,W) system. These sys-
tems are enclosed within dotted lines in Fig. 3. Out of
these systems, 152 are Ni-based, 22 are Co-based, and 5
are Fe-based. Furthermore, 76 have no reported phase
diagram [4, 5]. 66 of these “brand new” systems are Ni-
based, 9 are Co-based systems, and 1 is Fe-based system.
All the systems are listed in the Appendix. The experi-
mental phase diagrams complement the theoretical, ﬁrst
principles data available in Aflowlib [8] with a wealth
of relevant information [42].

In addition to serving as a proxy for bond strength,
the magnitude of ∆Hf is closely associated with the high
temperature limit of an alloy. If a compound has a large
negative formation enthalpy, it is more likely to with-
stand decomposition at higher temperatures, and thus,

formation enthalpy. Diamond indicates that there exists no stable binary or ternary compounds in the respective ternary
system. Colored circles indicate that the SQS-32 structure has a negative formation enthalpy. The color contrast from yellow
to black indicates decreasing formation enthalpy of the crystal structure in ternary system.

harder to destabilize. Fig. 3 shows that many Ni-based
alloys are as low as −400 meV compared to −167 meV
of the discovered Co3(Al,W) superalloy [23]. These Ni-
based superalloys in particular are interesting candidates
for high temperature superalloys.

Stability maps

In order to identify trends in our large data set, we vi-
sualize the results with “stability maps” (Fig. 4). In the
stability maps, the formation enthalpy of every system
computed in this work is displayed together, arranged in
a grid ordered by the Pettifor scale [41] of the two mi-
nority components, A, B in X3[A0.5, B0.5]. Fig. 4 exhibits
“islands of stability” in all Ni, Co, and Fe groups, with
Ni-based alloys showing particularly low ∆Hf compared
to Co- or Fe-based superalloys. In general, early d-block
elements and p-block combinations dominate the list of

stable systems. For Ni-based alloys, stable compounds
mostly comprise of transition metals Y, Sc, Zr, Hf, Ti,
Nb, Ta, and metalloids, including Ga, Si, and Sb.
In
the case of Co-based alloys, combinations of Zr, Hf, Ti,
Nb, Ta, and Al deﬁne the majority of stable compounds.
Combinations of Al, Si, Hf, and Ti with Fe tend to pro-
duce some stable compounds as well. On the other hand,
combinations with Os, Ru, and Cr tend to yield unstable
compounds for combinations with Ni, Co, and Fe.

Systems on the T = 0 K convex hull

In 27 ternary systems, the SQS-32 structure is found to
be on the T = 0 K convex hull (Table I). Out of these, 12
systems have no reported phase diagram [4, 5]. We can
see that except for the Co3(Ti,W) system, all systems on
the convex hull are Ni-based systems.

At T = 0 K, an ordered structure is always more stable

in alphabetical order. For systems with experimental data
in the literature, ‘∗’ implies that the ternary phase diagram
for the system exists [4, 5], but there is no structure in close
reference to the concentration of the SQS-32 considered in this
work. For systems where a reference is given, an alloy similar
to the concentration considered in this work is reported in
experimental literature.

Systems for which no data is reported in literature

sults are in good agreement with the current experimen-
tal literature where data exists (see Supplementary Infor-
mation for theoretical phase diagrams). In most of the
cases, the experimental phase diagrams are richer in data
than theoretical phase diagrams. This will improve over-
time as more data is included in Aflowlib. On the other
hand, Fig. 5 shows an example system for which the the-
oretical phase diagram reveals many ternary phases not
reported in the experimental literature.

Density of superalloys

Low density and high-temperature strength are two
critical properties of superalloys for any application. For
example, increased density can result in higher stress on
mating components in aircraft gas turbines [22]. A com-
parison between the density range for theoretical calcu-
lations performed in this work and modern superalloys is
listed in Fig. 6. Of the theoretical ternary combinations,
there are 13 Ni-based alloys and 4 Fe-based alloys with
density less than the range of commercially-available su-
peralloys (see Appendix). This certainly warrants further
analysis of mechanical properties of these alloys, which
may yield novel lightweight, high-strength superalloys.

sults showing the SQS-32 structure to be on convex hull
suggest the existence of less random structures which are
more stable at the same concentration. Further anal-
ysis using techniques such as cluster expansion [43–46]
for these systems is necessary to identify the most stable
structures at this concentration.

Phase diagrams

Bulk modulus

Ternary phase diagrams at T = 0 K for all 2111
compound-forming systems have been plotted in this
work using the data in Aflowlib [8]. These ternary
phase diagrams are included in the Supplementary Infor-
mation accompanying this work.

For the following systems, Al-Nb-Ni, Al-Ni-Ta, Al-Ni-
Ti, Ga-Nb-Ni, Ga-Ni-Sb, Ga-Ni-Ta, Ga-Ni-Ti, our re-

For the aforementioned systems with simultaneously
lower Ed and ∆Hf than the Co3(Al,W) system, the bulk
modulus is computed in this work (see Appendix). All
the Co- and Fe-based alloys have a bulk modulus of at
least 200 GPa. This is consistent with the observation
that commercial Co-based alloys have better mechanical
properties than many Ni-based alloys [1].

In case of Co-A-x systems, the bulk

The magnitude of the bulk modulus suggests that
Co-based superalloys are particularly resistant to com-
pression compared to Ni-based superalloys. 68 ternary
systems with simultaneously lower Ed and ∆Hf than
Co3[Al0.5,W0.5] have bulk moduli greater than 200 GPa.

IV. PROMISING CANDIDATES

Performance alone is not enough to qualify a great can-
didate superalloy. Cost, experimental diﬃculty, and tox-
icity are some additional factors to consider in compiling
a list of promising superalloys for further study. Avoid-
ing elements that are toxic, expensive, and diﬃcult to
handle (i.e. Au, Be, Cd, Ga, Hg, Ir, In, Li, Os, Pd, Pt,
Re, Rh, Ru, Sb, Sc, Tc, and Tl), we prioritize 21 superal-
loy systems from the 76 “brand new” systems suggested
in this work (Table II). Using the Herﬁndahl-Hirschman
Index (HHI) [52–54], we further prioritize three systems
of exceptional
interest. Ni24Si4Sn4, Ni24Sn4Zn4, and
Ni24Ti4Zn4 comprise of elements with high production
and large reserves—earning each constituent an HHI in-
dex below 1500 [52]. Given the ubiquity of these compo-

V. CONCLUSION

In this work, we carried out a high-throughput search
for ternary superalloys using the Aflow software pack-
age. We investigated a total of 2224 diﬀerent ternary
systems comprising of 41 diﬀerent elements using ﬁrst-
principles calculations. The stability maps (Fig. 4) in-
troduced in this work reveal that combinations of early
d-block and p-block elements tend to form stable superal-
loy systems with base-elements Ni, Co, and Fe. Ni-based
superalloys tend to be thermodynamically more stable
than Co- or Fe-based superalloys. A comparison between
the density range for our theoretical systems and modern
superalloys reveal many candidate low-density superal-
loys. Co-based superalloys are observed to have a higher
bulk modulus than Ni- and Fe-based alloys.

A total of 179 ternary systems are found to be more
stable and a have lower formation enthalpy than the
recently discovered Co3[Al0.5,W0.5] superalloy. Further
analysis should be done for these systems with e.g. cluster
expansion [44–46] in the interest of experimental veriﬁca-
tion. Of these, 76 systems have no experimental phase di-
agram reported in literature. Based on cost, experimen-
tal diﬃculty, and toxicity, we prioritize a shorter list of
21 promising superalloys, with three systems comprised
of elements earning an HHI < 1500 (Table II). Hopefully,
the theoretical predictions presented here serve as moti-
vation for their experimental validation, and be a guide
for future studies of these candidate superalloy systems.

VII. APPENDIX

A. Phase Diagram (Convex Hull) Analysis

We construct the T = 0 K convex hull using the phase
diagram module within Aflow [7]. Elements of this im-
plementation were inspired by the qhull algorithm [55].
For k-nary systems, it computes the distances to the hull
with the following considerations. Let a facet of the con-
vex hull, i.e. a hyperplane, be described by,

a0 +

k(cid:88)m=1

amxm = 0.

(1)

Here a1, . . . , ak deﬁne the normals of the hyperplane
while the constant a0 uniquely deﬁnes the hyperplane
in space. This is a simple extension of the familiar 3-D
plane equation Ax + By + Cz = D. Let the k-nary struc-
ture for which we need to ﬁnd the distance to convex hull
have the coordinates denoted in k-dimensional space as
c1, c2, . . . , ck, where c1, . . . , ck−1, are the concentrations
of the k− 1 elements in a k-nary system and ck is the for-
mation enthalpy. Note that we neglect the concentration
of the kth element because it is implicit given the other

FIG. 9. Distance to the T = 0 K convex hull algorithm. a) The correct distance (shown in green) for d1 is the minimum
distance of structure S1 to all hyperplanes deﬁning the convex hull. In case of structure S2, the minimum distance is not d2
(green line), an artifact of the hyperplane description for hull facets. b) Projecting the points to the zero energy line guarantees
that all points will lie within the hull, thus enabling the use of minimization algorithm to calculate the correct distance. The
distance to the hull d is given as the diﬀerence of the projected distance d2 from the distance to the zero energy line d1.

zero energy line, perform the minimization, and subtract
the projected distance. This is illustrated in Fig. 9b.

k − 1 concentrations. The distance d of the structure to
a given facet of the convex hull is computed as follows,

d = cn − 1

an(cid:32)−a0 +

amcm(cid:33) .

n−1(cid:88)m=1

(2)

This equation is diﬀerent from the nominal (shortest)
distance between a plane and a point, which projects the
point onto the plane along the normal vector. Instead,
we want the distance that projects the point onto the
plane along the energy axis.

The distance of the structure to the convex hull is the
minimum of Eq. 2 computed for all facets of the convex
hull. This minimization avoids a costly analysis of iden-
tifying the relevant facet, including the conversion of all
facet vertices to barycentric coordinates. However, it is
important to recognize that this minimization algorithm
is only valid for compounds above the convex hull.

The correct (incorrect) distances of each structure to
the convex hull is illustrated by the green (red) lines in
Fig. 9a. For structures within the convex hull, i.e. S1,
the minimum distance correctly matches the structure
to the plane immediately below it. However, imagine we
were interested in determining the importance/stability
of a convex hull member. This property may be quan-
tiﬁed by determining the distance of this structure from
the bottom of a new pseudo-hull which does not contain
the structure, such as what is illustrated by S2. For such
cases, we need a generalized distance to hull algorithm.
The minimization algorithm alone would not identify the
correct facet because the algorithm is dependent on the
hyperplane description of the facet. Therefore, it is possi-
ble to ﬁnd the imaginary extension of a distant facet to be
closer to the compound than that of the correct facet. To
avoid this problem, we generalize our algorithm by sim-
ply taking the projection of the point (compound) to the

[39] We found in our calculations that the formation enthalpy
of two compounds, namely Al2Co and Al2Fe with Be2Zn
structure (the prototype numbered 549 in Aflowlib [8]),
is anomalously low (<-1.8 eV/atom). Similar results with
this Be2Zn structure for other compounds were discussed
previously by Taylor et al. [56]. They attribute the erro-
neous results to PAW-pseudopotentials distributed with
VASP. The phase diagrams for systems with binary com-
binations (Al, Co) or (Al, Fe) are generated discarding
the Be2Zn structure in this work.
