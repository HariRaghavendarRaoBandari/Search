POLYNOMIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR

BOTT-SAMELSON MANIFOLDS

GOURI SHANKAR SEAL AND CATALIN ZARA

Abstract. Polynomial assignments for a torus T -action on a smooth manifold
M were introduced in [GGK99]; they form a module over S(t∗), the algebra
of polynomial functions on t, the Lie algebra of T . In this paper we describe
the assignment module AT (M ) for a natural T -action on a Bott-Samelson
manifold M = BS I , and present a method for computing generators.

1. Introduction

The study of polynomial assignments was initiated by Ginzburg, Guillemin, and
Karshon ([GGK99]) in conjunction with abstract moment maps, as a method of
understanding geometric information from underlying combinatorial data of group
action on manifolds. Recent works on this topic include [GSZ14] and [GM15] - the
latter is an extension to topological group actions.

GOURI SHANKAR SEAL AND CATALIN ZARA

In this paper we describe the assignment module AT (M ) for a natural action
of a torus T on a Bott-Samelson manifold M = BSI and present a method for
computing generators for this S(t∗)-module, where S(t∗) is the algebra of polyno-
mial functions on t, the Lie algebra of T . (See Section 2.1 for the deﬁnition of a
Bott-Samelson manifold BSI and of the T -action on it.) The method has been im-
plemented using Maple 15, Python and the commutative algebra package Singular.
A Bott-Samelson T -space M = BSI is equivariantly formal with ﬁnite ﬁxed point
set M T ; that allows one to identify AT (M ) with a subring of Maps(M T , S(t∗)). The
conditions that a map that assigns a polynomial to each ﬁxed point must satisfy in
order to represent an element of AT (M ) are encoded in the ﬁxed point data - ﬁxed
points and weights of isotropy representations ; we describe that data in Section 2.2.
We record the ﬁxed point data in an associated digraph, ΓI , with arrows labeled
by elements of t∗; the labels are thought of as homogeneous polynomials of degree
one in S(t∗) and are in fact roots for the Lie algebra deﬁning the Bott-Samelson
manifold.

In Section 3.1 we describe the combinatorial conditions that an element of
Maps(M T , S(t∗)) must satisfy in order to represent an assignment in AT (M ). Equi-
variant cohomology classes in HT (M ) can also be represented as maps from M T to
S(t∗); the subalgebra of maps that represent equivariant cohomology classes is de-
noted by HT (M ). Each equivariant cohomology class deﬁnes an assignment, hence
HT (M ) is a subalgebra of AT (M ); the assignments in HT (M ) are called cohomo-
logical. When the Bott-Samelson manifold is of GKM-type (in this case, when the
letters of the word I are distinct), all assignments are cohomological, but in all
other cases that is no longer true. The defect module AT (M )/HT (M ) is a torsion
module, and we compute it in a few cases.

To determine generators for the assignment module AT (BSI ) we use an induc-
tive method: BSI is a bundle over CP 1 with ﬁber BSI ′
, a Bott-Samelson space
determined by a word I ′ that consists of all-but-the-last letter of I. Using that, we
describe how one can compute the assignment module AT (BSI ) from the assign-
ment module AT (BSI ′
), ﬁrst for a particular case (Section 4.1) and then in the
general case (Section 4.2). These computations have been implemented in Maple by
the ﬁrst author. The assignment modules we have computed are free S(t∗)-modules,
and we conjecture that that is the case for all Bott-Samelson manifolds.

In the last section we describe an alternative construction of generators for the
assignment module, based on ideas from Morse theory. A generic ξ ∈ t determines
an orientation of the edges of the graph ΓI , and the oriented graph is acyclic.
Borrowing ideas from the construction of combinatorial Thom classes, we attempt
to determine generators as assignments supported on the ﬂow-up of a ﬁxed point
and satisfying natural normalization conditions. The situation is more complicated,
as we ended up with vertices having multiple such assignments associated with
them, and vertices for which no such assignments are needed. These computations
have been implemented in Singular ([GP08]) by the ﬁrst author.

2. Bott-Samelson Spaces

Bott-Samelson spaces were introduced in [BS58] as spaces with compact group
In this section we present an equivalent construction in the context of

actions.

complex groups; for details of a related construction see, for example, [GK94] or
[Wil04].

2.1. Deﬁnition. Let G be a connected, complex semisimple Lie group with Lie
algebra g, H a Cartan subgroup and B a Borel subgroup of G with H ⊂ B ⊂ G.
Let ∆ ⊂ h∗ be the set of roots and

(2.1)

g = h + Xα∈∆

gα

the corresponding Cartan decomposition. Choose a set of positive roots ∆+ and
let

(2.2)

Σ = {α1, α2, . . . , αr} ⊆ ∆+

be the simple roots. For an index i ∈ [r] := {1, 2, . . . , r}, let Pi := Pαi be the
minimal parabolic subgroup associated with αi, and for a word

(2.3)

of length |I| = d, let

I = [i1, i1, . . . , id] ∈ [r]d,

PI = Pid × Pid−1 × · · · × Pi1 .

The group Bd acts to the right on PI by

(2.4)

(pd, . . . , p1) · (bd, . . . , b1) = (pdbd, b−1

d pd−1bd−1, . . . , b−1

2 p1b1).

The Bott-Samelson manifold BSI is the quotient

(2.5)

BSI = PI /Bd = Pid ×B Pid−1 ×B · · · ×B Pi1 /B

and is a complex projective variety of dimension d. The orbit through a point
(pd, . . . , p1) ∈ PI is denoted by [pd, . . . , p1] ∈ BSI .

Let I = [id, id−1, . . . , i1] and I ′ = [id−1, . . . , i11]. The map PI → Pid given by
the projection onto the ﬁrst factor is equivariant with respect to the corresponding
actions of Bd and B and therefore induces a map π : BSI → Pid /B ≃ CP 1
(2.6)

π([pid , pid−1 , . . . , pid ]) = [pid ]
; hence BSI is a BSI ′

-bundle over CP 1.

with ﬁber PI ′ /Bd−1 = BSI ′

The group Pid acts on BSI by left multiplication on the ﬁrst factor; if T is the
maximal real torus included in B, then T acts on the left on ZI by the action on
the ﬁrst factor:

(2.7)

t · [pd, . . . , p1] = [tpd, . . . , p1].

and the map (2.6) is T -equivariant. (It is, in fact, Pid -equivariant.)

There is a real/compact-group description of BSI , as follows: for every j ∈ [n],
we have Pj/B ≃ Kj/T for a compact Lie group Kj with T ⊂ Kj ⊂ Pj. The torus
T d acts on

KI = Kid × · · · × Ki1

by

(2.8)

Then

(kd, . . . , k1) · (td, . . . , t1) = (kdtd, t−1

d kd−1td−1, . . . , t−1

2 k1t1).

BSI = KI /T d = Kid ×T Kid−1 ×T · · · ×T Ki1 /T.

The orbit through (kd, . . . , k1) ∈ KI is denoted by [kd, . . . , k1] ∈ BSI .

4

GOURI SHANKAR SEAL AND CATALIN ZARA

We are interested in describing the assignment ring AT (BSI ) for this action of
T on BSI ; more precisely, we want to construct generators for this S(t∗)-module
and to understand the defect module AT (BSI )/HT (BSI ).

2.2. Fixed-Point Data. For all indices j ∈ [n], the ﬁxed points of the T -action
on (Pj/B)T ≃ (Kj/T )T are given by

(2.9)

(Kj ∩ N (T ))/T 6 W,

where W is the Weyl group of G and N (T ) is the normalizer of T . There are two
such ﬁxed points: one is [1], the class of the identity, and the other is [qj], the class
of the element qj ∈ Kj ∩ N (T ) whose co-adjoint action on t∗ is given by

(2.10)

sj := sαj : t∗ → t∗,

the reﬂection determined by the simple root αj ([GHZ06]). Hence the ﬁxed points
for the T -action on BSI for I = [j] are indexed by the set {[0 · j], [1 · j]} = {[0], [j]}
of subwords of I. The weight of the (complex) isotropy representation of T on the
tangent space at [0 · j] is αj, and the weight at [1 · j] is sj(αj) = −αj.

In general, the ﬁxed-point set (BSI )T is indexed by the subwords of I; these are

expressions of the form

(2.11)
where ǫ : [d] → {0, 1} and ǫj := ǫ(j). Hence, for general I, the T -action on BSI has
2|I| ﬁxed points. For a subword Jǫ of I, the weights of the isotropy representation
on the tangent space at the corresponding ﬁxed point pǫ := Jǫ are

J = Jǫ := [ǫ1i1, . . . , ǫdid]

(2.12)

where s1

Remark 2.1. To save space we will sometimes remove the commas and brackets
and denote, for example, [0, 1, 2] by 012.

Example 2.2. Let I = [i1, i2] = [2, 1] = 21 be a word of length 2. The ﬁxed
point set (BS21)T is indexed by {00, 01, 20, 21}. The weights of the T -action are as
follows:

2.3. The Associated Graph. The data in Example 2.2 can be arranged in the
following digraph (for each arrow, there is a second arrow in the reverse direction):

The vertical arrows correspond to P1/B; the horizontal arrows correspond to the
ﬁber bundle BS[2,1] → BS[1]: the bottom arrow corresponds to the ﬁber over 00,
which is a copy of BS2, and the top arrow is the ﬁber over 01, an s1-twisted copy
of BS2. The weights of the opposite arrows are the opposite of the weights shown
above: for example, the arrow 21 → 20 is labeled by −α1.

More general, to each Bott-Samelson space BSI we associate a decorated digraph

ΓI , with arrows labeled by roots, constructed as follows:

• The vertices of ΓI are labeled by the 2|I| subwords of I;
• The edges of ΓI are of the form JǫJǫ′ , for all subwords that diﬀer in exactly
one position - for each edge there are two arrows, in both directions of the
edge;

• If Jǫ = [ǫ1i1, . . . , ǫdid] and Jǫ′ diﬀer exactly on position j, then the arrow

Jǫ → Jǫ′ is labeled by

(2.13)

αǫ,ǫ′ = sǫd

· · · sǫj

ij αij ;

note that αǫ′,ǫ = −αǫ,ǫ′.

Example 2.3. Let I = [2, 1, 3] = 213; then BS[2,1,3] → BS[3] is a ﬁber bundle with
ﬁber BS[2,1]. The associated graph is:

3. Assignments for Bott-Samelson Spaces

3.1. Deﬁnitions. The decorated digraph ΓI = (VI , EI , α) encodes all the infor-
mation needed to determine the polynomial assignments for the T -action on BSI
(for details of the construction, see [GSZ14]). The S(t∗)-algebra AT (BSI ) is the

/

6

GOURI SHANKAR SEAL AND CATALIN ZARA

S(t∗)-subalgebra of Maps(VI , S(t∗)) consisting of those maps f : VI → S(t∗) with
the property that

(3.1)

f (Jǫ) ≡ f (Jǫ′)

(mod αǫ,ǫ′)

for all edges JǫJǫ′ of the graph ΓI .

Example 3.1. If I = [ ] is the empty word, then BSI = {pt} and AT (BS[ ]) = S(t∗)
is a free S(t∗)-module, with a basis given by the assignment A[ ] that takes the value
1 at the ﬁxed point [ ].

Example 3.2. If I = [j] is a word of length 1, then AT (BS[j]) consists of those
maps f : {[0], [j]} → S(t∗) such that

(3.2)

f ([j]) ≡ f ([0])

(mod αj).

That is a free S(t∗)-module, with a basis given by {A[0], A[j]}, where A[0](Jǫ) = 1
for all Jǫ and

(3.3)

A[j](Jǫ) =(0,

αj,

if Jǫ = [0]
if Jǫ = [j]

.

We record this information as a 2 × 2 matrix

(3.4)

AI =(cid:20)1

1 αj(cid:21)

with columns corresponding to the assignments A[0] and A[j], and rows indexed by
the ﬁxed point set (BSI )T , hence by the subwords of I.

3.2. Cohomological Assignments. There is an injective morphism of S(t∗)-algebras

(3.5)

HT (BSI ) → AT (BSI )

from equivariant cohomology to assignments; therefore HT (BSI ) is identiﬁed with
an S(t∗)-subalgebra HT (BSI ); assignments that are in the subalgebra HT are called
cohomological assignments.

The subalgebra HT (BSI ) is a free S(t∗)-module of rank 2|I|, with a basis given
for J =

by cohomological assignments indexed by the ﬁxed points, as follows:
[ǫ1i1, . . . , ǫdid], let HJ : (BSI )T → S(t∗) be deﬁned by

where J 6 J ′ = [ǫ′

to classes, with H I

In general, if we list the ﬁxed points in increasing right-to-left lexicographical

order, the matrix H [I,j] can be computed from H I as follows:

(3.7)

H [I,j] =(cid:20) H I

sjH I αjsjH I(cid:21) .

For BS[2,1] at each ﬁxed point, the weights are pairwise non-collinear. Spaces

that satisfy this condition are said to be of GKM type.

Proposition 3.4. The T -space BSI is of GKM type if and only if the letters of I
are distinct.

Proof. The weights at the ﬁxed point [0, 0, . . . , 0] are {αi | i ∈ I}, hence if BSI is
of GKM type, then the letters of I must be distinct.

For the converse, assume that I = [i1, . . . , id] has distinct letters, but at some
ﬁxed point Jǫ = [ǫ1i1, . . . , ǫdid], two of the weights are collinear. Then there exist
ℓ < m in [d] such that

which is impossible, since the simple roots are linearly independent. Hence if the
weights at [0, . . . , 0] are pairwise non-collinear, so are the weights at any other ﬁxed
point.
(cid:3)

The only spaces BSI for which for which all assignments are cohomological are

those of GKM type, hence those for which the letters of I are distinct.

3.3. Delta Classes. What happens when BSI is not of GKM type? Then not
all assignments are cohomological, and in this section we present examples of such
classes, associated to points, edges, or faces of the graph ΓI .

Example 3.5. Let I = [2, 1, 2]; then M = BS[2,1,2] → BS[2] is a ﬁber bundle with
ﬁber BS[2,1]. The associated graph is:

Then δ is an assignment, but not a cohomological one: if it were, by the localization

and this is not a polynomial; hence δ is a non-cohomological assignment.

More examples of delta classes, associated to edges and faces, are presented
below. Some of them are cohomological, and some are not. For higher dimensional
examples, the fact that the integral is a polynomial, while necessary, is not also
suﬃcient to guarantee that a class is cohomological.
(Necessary and suﬃcient
conditions are given in [Pab14] and [GSZ14]).
Example 3.6. Let M = BS[1,2,3,1] and let e be the 1-dimensional face (edge) with
vertices at 1001 and 1031. A neighborhood of e in the associated graph is shown
below:

Then a class supported on the edge e would assign polynomials of degree 3 to 1001
and 1031. However, if hα3, α1i = 0 (for example, in type A), then s1s3α1 = −α1
then a delta class δe given by

if v = 1001

otherwise

assigns 0 or a polynomial of degree only two to each vertex.
Example 3.7. Let M = BS[1,2,3,1,2] and let f be the 2-dimensional face with

graph is shown below:

each vertex. Note that, although a priori a class supported on f would be a class
determined by three outside conditions (hence would assign a polynomial of degree
three at each vertex), δf assigns a polynomial of degree two at each vertex: that
is a consequence of the fact that at each vertex of f , the outside weights contain
repeated directions.

4. Inductive Construction of Assignments

4.1. Example. In this section we determine all the assignments on M = BS[2,1,2]
and we show that AT (M ) is a free S(t∗)-module. In subsequent sections, we expand
the ideas of this construction to the general case.

The key remark is that BS[2,1,2] → BS[2] is a ﬁber bundle with ﬁber BS[2,1].
On the associated graph, that is shown by the fact that the bottom face (the ﬁber
over [0]) is a copy of BS[2,1], and the top face (the ﬁber over [0]) is an s2-twisted
copy of BS[2,1]. Therefore, if η ∈ AT (BS[2,1,2]), then

η|[.,0] ∈ AT (BS[2,1])

and

s2η|[.,2] ∈ AT (BS[2,1]).

be the matrix determined in Example 3.3, with rows and columns indexed by J ∈
{[0, 0], [2, 0], [0, 1], [2, 1]}. Then

η([J, 0]) = a[0,0,0]A[0,0](J) + a[2,0,0]A[2,0](J)
+ a[0,1,0]A[0,1](J) + a[2,1,0]A[2,1](J)

η([J, 2]) = a[0,0,2]s2A[0,0](J) + a[2,0,2]s2A[2,0](J)
+ a[0,1,2]s2A[0,1](J) + a[2,1,2]s2A[2,1](J);

These columns are linearly independent, hence they form a basis of the S(t∗)-

module AT (BS[2,1,2]); therefore one can use

A[2,1,2] =(cid:20) A[2,1]

s2A[2,1]

s2A[2,1] · U [2,1,2](cid:21)

H [2,1,2] =(cid:20) H [2,1]

would correspond to the situation U = α2I.

The ﬁrst seven columns of A[2,1,2] are the same as the ﬁrst seven columns of
H [2,1,2]; in particular, those seven assignments are cohomological. The eight col-
umn, (A[2,1,2])[2,1,2], is diﬀerent, because U 6= α2I4. One can check that

(4.14)

(A[2,1,2])[2,1,2] = −hα1, α2i(A[2,1,2])[2,0,2] + δ[2,0,2].

In particular, one can replace the eight assignment class by δ[2,0,2]. This proves
that, for M = BS[2,1,2], the defect module AT (M )/HT (M ) is generated by a delta
assignment, δ[2,0,2]: every assignment on M can be written as a combination of a
cohomological assignment and δ[2,0,2].

4.2. General Construction. The construction in the general case follows the
same procedure.

Let I be a word of length |I| = d, I ′ = [I, j], and α = αj . Then the projection

on the last letter,

(4.15)

πj : Γ]I,j] → Γ[j]

is the combinatorial description of the ﬁber bundle BS[I,j] → BS[j]; the ﬁbers are

Γ[0]
[I,j] := π−1
Γ[j]
[I,j] := π−1

j

j

([0]) ≃ ΓI

([j]) ≃ sjΓI .

Suppose the assignment module AT (BSI ) is a free S(t∗)-module of rank 2d, with
a basis indexed by the subwords of I. Let A = AI be the matrix whose columns
record the vectors of this basis.

12

If η ∈ AT (BSI ′

ﬁbers, hence

), then the restrictions to the two ﬁbers are assignments on the

η([., 0]) ∈ AT (BSI ) =⇒ η([., 0]) =XJ
sjη([., j]) ∈ AT (BSI ) =⇒ η([., j]) =XJ

a[J,0]AJ (.)

a[J,j]sjAJ (.),

with the summations over the subwords J of I. Hence

(4.16)

η =(cid:20)η([., 0])

η([., j])(cid:21) =(cid:20)A

0

0

sjA(cid:21)(cid:20)a[., 0]
a[., j](cid:21) .

The compatibility conditions along the edges [J, 0] − [J, j] are satisﬁed if and

only if

(4.17)

A[∆[.]] ≡ 0 (mod α),

where ∆[.] = a[.,j] − a[.,0].

A second, essential, assumption is that the matrix A mod α can be transformed
into a reduced row echelon form through row operations and column swapping - this
is not a trivial assumption, since we are operating with matrices of polynomials,
hence over the ring S(t∗). If J ′ are the indices of the basic variables and J ′′ the
indices of the free variables, we assume that we have written the columns of A in
that order; then A can be transformed into

Then the general solution of the system of congruences (4.17) is

η =(cid:20)η([., 0])

η([., j])(cid:21) =(cid:20) A

0

sαA sαA · U [I,j](cid:21)(cid:20)b[., 0]
b[., j](cid:21) ,

hence every assignment for BS[I,j] can be written as a linear combination of the
columns of the matrix

(4.22)

A[I,j] =(cid:20) AI

sjAI

0

sjAI · U [I,j](cid:21) .

Since the columns of AI form a basis for AT (BSI ), the matrix AI is invertible
over the ﬁeld of fractions of S(t∗). Then sjAI is invertible, and since U is also
invertible, it follows that A[I,j] is invertible over the ﬁeld of fractions of S(t∗).
Therefore the columns of A[I,j] are independent over S(t∗), hence the columns of
A[I,j] form a basis of AT (BS[I,j]).

4.3. Transition Formula. We have seen that if I has distinct letters, then BSI is
of GKM-type and all assignments are cohomological; hence we can take AI = H I .
In, general, suppose

(4.23)
with V I a matrix with entries in Q(t∗), the ﬁeld of fractions of S(t∗). Then, under
the assumptions of the previous section,

AI = H I V I

A[I,j] =(cid:20) AI

In particular, under our assumptions, each assignment can be written in a unique
way as a linear combination over the ﬁeld of fractions Q(t∗) of the cohomological
assignments that occur as columns of H; the cohomological assignments are those
for which the coeﬃcients are polynomials.

For example, the delta assignment δe on BS[1,2,3,1] in Example 3.6 can be written

as

(4.27)

δe = −

α1 + α2

α1

H1001 +

1
α1

H1201 −

1
α1

H1031;

hence δe is not cohomological. Similarly, the delta assignment δf for BS[1,2,3,1,2]
in Example 3.7 can be written as a linear combination of H10010, H10310, H10012,
H12012, and H10312, but not all coeﬃcients are polynomials (in fact, none is), so δf
is non cohomological.

4.4. Software. We have extensively used the Coxeter package written by John
Stembridge and MAPLE 15 for our calculations. Using notations from the last
section our input is the Lie-type of the Lie group and the word I ′ = [I, α] of length
d + 1 that deﬁnes the Bott-Samelson space BSI ′
. Using the Cartan matrix for
the given Lie-type and simple reﬂections from Coxeter we next generate the one-
skeleton of BSI ′
. We store it as a 2d+1 × (d + 1) matrix M whose (i, j) entry is a
list of the form [vi, vj, αi,j]. Here vi is the ith ﬁxed point, vj is the jth neighboring
ﬁxed point of vi and αi,j is the weight vector pointing from vi towards vj. We
initialize the iteration by starting from [1] as a basis of assignment cohomology of
a point as a module over S(t∗). Then, in each iteration step we row reduce the
basis matrix from the previous step such that while performing the reduction step
we stay inside the polynomial ring S(t∗). Therefore, using the general construction
outlined in the last section we produce the two matrices

5. Morse-Type Generators

5.1. Generating Ideals. Let BSI be a Bott-Samelson space, associated to a word
I. A vector ξ ∈ t is called polarizing if α(ξ) 6= 0 for all roots; let P ⊂ t be the set
of all polarizing vectors.

For a polarizing vector ξ, we say that an edge (p, q) of the graph ΓI is ascending

if αp,q(ξ) > 0, and is descending if αp,q(ξ) < 0.

The Cartan-Killing form on t allows us to canonically identify t and t∗: for β ∈ t∗,
there is a unique Xβ ∈ t such that β(ξ) = Xβ · ξ. Moreover, α · β = Xα · Xβ for all
α, β ∈ t∗.

If α, β are roots, then

sαβ(ξ) = β(ξ) − 2

β · α
α · α

α(ξ) = Xβ · ξ − 2

Xβ · Xα
Xα · Xα

Xα · ξ

= Xβ ·(cid:16)ξ − 2

Xα · ξ
Xα · Xα

Xα(cid:17) = β(sXα ξ);

in particular, if ξ is polarizing, then sXαξ is also polarizing.

Proposition 5.1. For every choice of a polarizing vector ξ, if all the edges of ΓI
are oriented as ascending edges, then the resulting oriented graph is acyclic.

Proof. We prove the statement by induction on |I|.

The base case I = [i] is clear. Suppose the statement is true for I and let
I ′ = [I, j] be an extension of I. Let BS[I,j] → BS[j] be the ﬁber bundle over CP 1
with ﬁber BSI . Any cycle of Γ[I,j] lies either in the ﬁber over [0] or in the ﬁber over
[j], since all the arrows from one ﬁber to the other are oriented the same way. The
ﬁber over [0] is a copy of BSI and, by induction, the corresponding graph is acyclic.
The ﬁber over [j] is an sj-twisted copy; the reﬂection sj induces an isomorphism of
oriented graphs between this copy and the original BSI , the former oriented by ξ
and the latter by sXαξ. Hence the ﬁber over [j] is also acyclic.
(cid:3)

Let BSI be a Bott-Samelson space and ξ ∈ P a polarizing vector.
We deﬁne a partial order on the vertices of ΓI (ﬁxed points of the T -action on
BSI ) by p 4 q if there exists a chain of ascending edges from p to q in the graph
ΓI , oriented by the polarizing vector ξ.

Example 5.2. For example, for BS[2,1], a polarizing ξ in the positive Weyl chamber
orients the graph Γ[2,1] as follows (the arrows indicate the ascending directions):

s1α2

01

α1

α2

21

20

The partial order has two maximal chains, (0, 0) ≺ (0, 1) ≺ (2, 1) and (0, 0) ≺

(2, 0) ≺ (2, 1); the vertices (0, 1) and (2, 0) are incomparable.

and let

(5.3)

I(p) = {η(p) | η ∈ AT (BSI

<p)} ⊂ S(t∗)

be the ideal of S(t∗) deﬁned by the values at p of assignments supported on the
ﬂow-up from p. Then I(p) is ﬁnitely generated, because S(t∗) is Noetherian.

For a vertex p, let Gp be a ﬁnite set of assignments in AT (BSI

<p) such that the

values at p of the assignments in Gp generate the ideal I(p) over S(t∗):

(5.4)

Then

(5.5)

I(p) = hη(p) | η ∈ GpiS(t∗).

Gp

G =[p

is a system of generators for AT (BSI ); we will refer to these assignments as Morse
generators.

5.2. Construction of Morse Generators. Let p be a ﬁxed point for the T -action
on BSI , and let ξ be a polarizing vector. Suppose AT (BSI ) is a free S(t∗)-module,
with a basis recorded as columns of a matrix AI ; each column AI
J corresponds to
a subword J ⊆ I; hence there are n = 2|I| columns. Let {v1, v2, . . . , vk} be the
complement of the ﬂow-up Fp.

Let η ∈ AT (BSI

<p) be an assignment supported on the ﬂow-up Fp. Then
