Introduction and main result

The goal of this paper is to study the eigenvalue problem

− div(|x|α∇u(x)) = λg(x)u(x), ∀ x ∈ RN ,

(1.1)

where N ≥ 3, α ∈ (0, 2), λ > 0 and g : RN → R is a function that can change sign on RN satisfying the
following basic assumption

loc(RN ), g+ = g1 + g2 6= 0, g1 ∈ L

(G) g ∈ L1
lim|x|→∞ |x|2−αg2(x) = 0.
Remark. Note that there exists functions h : RN → R such that h 6∈ L
2−α (RN ) but h satisﬁes limx→y |x−
y|2−αh(x) = 0, for all y ∈ RN and lim|x|→∞ |x|2−αh(x) = 0. Indeed, simple computations show that we
can take h(x) = |x|α−2[log(2 + |x|2−α)](α−2)/N , if x 6= 0 and h(0) = 1.

2−α (RN ) and limx→y |x − y|2−αg2(x) = 0, for all y ∈ RN and

In the case when α = 0 problem (1.1) becomes

− ∆u(x) = λg(x)u(x), ∀ x ∈ RN .

(1.2)

For this problem A. Szulkin & M. Willem proved in [8] the existence of an unbounded and increasing
sequence of eigenvalues. Motivated by this result on problem (1.2) we consider in this paper the natural
generalization of problem (1.2) given by problem (1.1), obtained in the case of the presence of the degenerate
and singular potential |x|α in the divergence operator. This potential leads to a diﬀerential operator

div(|x|α∇u(x))

which is degenerate and singular in the sense that lim|x|→0 |x|α = 0 and lim|x|→∞ |x|α = ∞, provided that
α ∈ (0, 2). Consequently, we will analyze equation (1.1) in the case when the operator div(|x|α∇u(x)) is
not strictly elliptic in the sense pointed out in D. Gilbarg & N. S. Trudinger [6] (see, page 31 in [6] for the

1

deﬁnition of strictly elliptic operators). It follows that some of the techniques that can be applied in solving
equations involving strictly elliptic operators fail in this new context. For instance some concentration
phenomena may occur in the degenerate and singular case which lead to a lack of compactness. This is in
keeping, on the one hand, with the action of the non-compact group of dilations in RN and, on the other
hand, with the fact that we are looking for entire solutions for problem (1.1), that means solutions deﬁned
on the whole space.

Regarding the real-world applications of problems of type (1.1) we remember that degenerate diﬀerential
operators like the one which appears in (1.1) are used in the study of many physical phenomena related to
equilibrium of anisotropic continuous media (see [5]). In an appropriate context we also note that problems
of type (1.1) come also from considerations of standing waves in anisotropic Schr¨odinger equations (see,
e.g. [7]).

A powerful tool that can be useful when we deal with equations of type (1.1) is the Caﬀarelli-Kohn-
Nirenberg inequality. More exactly, in 1984, L. Caﬀarelli, R. Kohn & L. Nirenberg proved in [1] (see also
[2] and [3]), in the context of some more general inequalities, the following result: given p ∈ (1, N ), for all
u ∈ C∞

0 (RN ), there exists a positive constant Ca,b such that

(cid:18)ZRN |x|−bq|u|q dx(cid:19)p/q

≤ Ca,bZRN |x|−ap|∇u|p dx ,

(1.3)

where

−∞ < a <

N − p

, a ≤ b ≤ a + 1,

q =

N − p(1 + a − b)

.

The constant Ca,b in inequality (1.3) is never achieved (see the paper of F. Catrina and Z.-Q. Wang [4] for
detailes).

Note that the Caﬀarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality (1.3) reduces to the classical Sobolev inequality
(if a = b = 0) and to the Hardy inequality (if a = 0 and b = 1). Furthermore, its utility is even more
important since it implies some Sobolev and Hardy type inequalities in the context of degenerate diﬀerential
operators. More exactly, in the case when N ≥ 3, α ∈ (0, 2), p = q = 2, a = −α/2 and b = (2 − α)/2 then
inequality (1.3) reads

Willem [9, Th´eor`eme 20.7]). On the other hand, taking N ≥ 3, α ∈ (0, 2), p = 2, q = 2N
b = 0 in (1.3) we ﬁnd that there exists a positive constant Cα := C −α

N −2+α plays the role of the critical Sobolev exponent in the classical Sobolev inequality.

Turning back to equation (1.1) and taking into account the above discussion we notice that the natural

functional space where we can analyze equation (1.1) is the closure of C∞

0 (RN ) under the norm

Let us denote this space by W 1,2
the scalar product

On the other hand, we also point out that by construction inequalities (1.4) and (1.5) hold for all u ∈
W 1,2

We say that λ > 0 is an eigenvalue of problem (1.1) if there exists uλ ∈ W 1,2

α (RN ) \ {0} such that

g(x)uλϕ dx ,

for all ϕ ∈ W 1,2
corresponding to λ.

α (RN ). For each eigenvalue λ > 0 we will call uλ in the above deﬁnition an eigenvector

The main result of our paper is given by the following theorem:

Theorem 1. Assume that condition (G) is fulﬁlled. Then problem (1.1) has an unbounded, increasing
sequence of positive eigenvalues.

2 Proof of the main result

The conclusion of Theorem 1 will follow from the results of Lemmas 2 and 3 below.

We start by proving the following auxiliary result:

Lemma 1. Assume that condition (G) is fulﬁlled. Then the functional Λ : W 1,2

α (RN ) → R,

Λ(u) = ZRN

g+(x)u2 dx ,

is weakly continuous.

Proof. • First, we show that W 1,2
Indeed, let {un} ⊂ W 1,2

2−α (RN ) we infer that T

is also continuous. Combining that fact with the remarks considered at the beginning of the proof we ﬁnd
that

N −2+α (RN ). Undoubtedly, T is linear. Since by (G) we have g1 ∈ L

N

lim
n→∞

T (un) = T (u) ,

in other words, W 1,2

α (RN ) ∋ u −→ RRN g1(x)u2 dx is weakly continuous.

• Next, we verify that W 1,2

α (RN ) is a sequence converging weakly to u ∈ W 1,2

α (RN ) ∋ u −→ RRN g2(x)u2 dx is weakly continuous. Assume again that
α (RN ) and ǫ > 0 is arbitrary

α (RN ) in W 1,2

{un} ⊂ W 1,2
but ﬁxed.

By assumption (G) we deduce that there exists R > 0 such that

|x|2−αg2(x) ≤ ǫ, ∀ x ∈ Bc

R(0) ,

where Bc

R(0) := RN \ BR(0) and BR(0) ⊂ RN represents the open ball centered at the origin of radius R.

Recalling again condition (G) and using a compactness argument we ﬁnd that there exists a ﬁnite covering
of BR(0) by closed balls Br1 (x1),..., Brk (xk) such that for each j ∈ {1, ..., k} we have

|x − xj|2−αg2(x) ≤ ǫ, ∀ x ∈ Brj (xj ) .

It is easy to see that there exists r > 0 such that for each j ∈ {1, ..., k} it holds

In order to go further we consider the following minimization problem:

(P1) minimizeu∈W 1,2

α (RN )RRN |x|α|∇u|2 dx, under restriction RRN g(x)u2 dx = 1.

Lemma 2. Assume that condition (G) is fulﬁlled. Then problem (P1) has a solution e1 ≥ 0. Moreover,
e1 is an eigenfunction of problem (1.1) corresponding to the eigenvalue λ1 := RRN |x|α|∇e1|2 dx.

Proof. Consider {un} ⊂ W 1,2

α (RN ) is a minimizing sequence for (P1), i.e.

and

ZRN |x|α|∇un|2 dx → inf (P1) ,

for all n. It follows that {un} is bounded in W 1,2
that {un} converges weakly to u in W 1,2

α (RN ) such
α (RN ). By the weakly lower semi-continuity of the norm we deduce

α (RN ) and consequently there exists u ∈ W 1,2

ZRN |x|α|∇u|2 dx ≤ lim inf

n→∞ ZRN |x|α|∇un|2 dx = inf (P1) .

On the other hand, it is clear that

ZRN

g−(x)u2

n dx = ZRN

g+(x)u2

for each n. Lemma 1 and Fatou’s lemma yield

ZRN

g−(x)u2 dx ≤ ZRN

g+(x)u2 dx − 1 ,

1 ≤ ZRN

g(x)u2 dx .

or

Deﬁne, now, e1 =

u

(RRN g(x)u2 dx)1/2 . It is easy to see that RRN g(x)e2
ZRN |x|α|∇e1|2 dx = RRN |x|α|∇u|2 dx

RRN g(x)u2 dx ≤ ZRN |x|α|∇u|2 dx ≤ inf (P1) .

1 dx = 1 and

This shows that e1 is a solution of (P1). Moreover, it is easy to see that |e1| is also a solution of (P1) and
consequently we can assume that e1 ≥ 0.

Next, for each ϕ ∈ W 1,2

α (RN ) arbitrary but ﬁxed we deﬁne f : R → R by

f (ǫ) = RRN |x|α|∇(e1 + ǫϕ)|2 dx
RRN g(x)(e1 + ǫϕ)2 dx

.

Clearly, f is of class C1 and f (0) ≤ f (ǫ) for all ǫ ∈ R. Consequently, 0 is a minimum point of f and thus,

The proof of Lemma 2 is complete.

In order to ﬁnd other eigenvalues of problem (1.1) we solve the minimization problems

(Pn) minimizeu∈W 1,2
RRN |x|α∇u∇e1 dx = ... = RRN |x|α∇u∇en−1 dx = 0 and RRN g(x)u2 dx = 1,
where ej represents the solution of problem (Pj ), for j ∈ {1, ..., n − 1}.
Lemma 3. Assume that condition (G) is fulﬁlled. Then, for every n ≥ 2 problem (Pn) has a solution en.
Moreover, en is an eigenfunction of problem (1.1) corresponding to the eigenvalue λn := RRN |x|α|∇en|2 dx.
Furthermore, limn→∞ λn = ∞.

Proof. The existence of en can be obtained in the same manner as in the proof of Lemma 2, but

replacing W 1,2

α (RN ) with the closed linear subspace
Xn := (cid:26)u ∈ W 1,2

α (RN ); ZRN |x|α∇u∇e1 dx = ... = ZRN |x|α∇u∇en−1 dx = 0 (cid:27) .
