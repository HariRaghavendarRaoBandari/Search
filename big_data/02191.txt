ABSTRACT

We measured the binding energy of N2, CO, O2, CH4, and CO2 on non-porous (compact) amorphous
solid water (np-ASW), of N2 and CO on porous amorphous solid water (p-ASW), and of NH3 on
crystalline water ice. We were able to measure binding energies down to a fraction of 1% of a layer,
thus making these measurements more appropriate for astrochemistry than the existing values. We
found that CO2 forms clusters on np-ASW surface even at very low coverages. The binding energies
of N2, CO, O2, and CH4 decrease with coverage in the submonolayer regime. Their values at the
low coverage limit are much higher than what is commonly used in gas-grain models. An empirical
formula was used to describe the coverage dependence of the binding energies. We used the newly
determined binding energy distributions in a simulation of gas-grain chemistry for cold cloud and
hot core models. We found that owing to the higher value of desorption energy in the sub-monlayer
regime a fraction of all these ices stays much longer and up to higher temperature on the grain surface
compared to the single value energies currently used in the astrochemical models.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the last two decades,

the importance of con-
sidering the chemistry occurring on grains or with
grains has become clear (Vidali 2013; Linnartz et al.
2015), thanks to an ever increasing number of labo-
ratory experiments required to explain new observa-
tional data on ices coating dust grains (Boogert et al.
2015).
Simulations of ISM environments make now
use of gas-grain chemical networks, whether they em-
ploy rate-equations (Garrod et al. 2008), kinetic Monte
Carlo (Vasyunin et al. 2009), or other stochastic meth-
ods (Biham et al. 2001). One key parameter that inﬂu-
ences the ISM chemistry is the binding energy of a parti-
cle on a dust grain. The residence time of a particle on a
grain is directly related to its binding energy to the grain
through t = τ exp(ED/kBTs), where ED is the binding
energy, Ts is the temperature of the surface and τ is a
characteristic time often associated, in the simplest case,
to the inverse vibrational frequency of the particle in the
adsorption well. Furthermore, in models the energy bar-
rier for thermal diﬀusion is estimated by an empirical
relation, R = Ed/ED, where Ed is the energy barrier
to diﬀusion. For weakly held particles on surfaces—the
ones of interest here, R ∼ 0.3 for crystalline surfaces
(Antczak & Ehrlich 2005; Bruch et al. 2007), but higher
(0.5–0.8) for disordered/amorphous surfaces (Katz et al.
1999; Garrod et al. 2008). Modern day astrochemical
models used a ﬁxed binding energy for desorption; how-
ever, in reality the binding energy is a function of cov-
erage. Recently, we found an empirical correlation be-
tween the sticking coeﬃcient (or the probability for a
particle to stick to a surface) and the binding energy
for simple molecules on non-porous amorphous solid wa-
ter (np-ASW) (He et al. 2016). To know when and how
molecules desorb from ices is obviously very important,

especially in hot cores scenarios, where photons from the
new star warm up the surrounding ice-coated grains caus-
ing an increase in detectable abundance of molecules in
the gas-phase (Ikeda et al. 2001; Bisschop et al. 2007).

To obtain the binding energy of atoms or molecules on
a surface, the technique of Thermal Programmed Desorp-
tion (TPD) is often used; see Kolasinski (2008) and next
section for details. Although TPD measures the desorp-
tion energy, or the energy necessary to desorb a particle,
this energy is essentially the binding energy if there are
no activated processes, as it should be the case for simple
molecules on ices. While there have been numerous labo-
ratory experiments for determining the binding energy of
molecules on ices (Collings et al. 2004; Burke & Brown
2010; Noble et al. 2012; Mart´ın-Dom´enech et al. 2014;
Collings et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2016), most of them
were done at monolayer or multilayer coverage. How-
ever, when disordered or amorphous surfaces are con-
cerned, which is the case of ices in the ISM, there is
a notable variation of the binding energy with cover-
age, as in the case of D2 on porous amorphous solid
water (p-ASW) (Amiaud et al. 2006). The smaller the
fraction of molecules on a disordered surface, the higher
the binding energy. Except in a few cases, in the ISM
the abundance of molecules in water ices is very low
(Boogert et al. 2015). Thus, in order to interpret obser-
vational data correctly and to predict abundances using
simulations, it is important to have the appropriate value
of the binding energy of molecules on ices. In this contri-
bution, we report the careful measurement of binding en-
ergies of simple molecules (N2, O2, CO, CH4, and CO2)
on np-ASW at submonolayer (subML) and monolayer
(ML) coverage, from ∼ 0.001 to 1 ML. We also studied
the desorption of N2 and CO from p-ASW, and of NH3
from crystalline water ice. We derived a simple formula
to estimate the binding energy change vs. submonolayer
coverage; we then used this formula in a gas-grain chem-

The paper is structured as follows.

In the next sec-
tion we give a description of the apparatus and of the
experimental methods. In Section 3 we present the data
and their analysis. From this analysis we obtain a simple
function of the binding energy vs. coverage which, in Sec-
tion 4, is used in a simulation of the chemical evolution
of a dense cloud. In Section 5 we summarize the eﬀect
of the new binding energy determinations on abundances
of the evolution of a dense cloud.

2. EXPERIMENTAL

A detailed description of the apparatus can be found
elsewhere (Jing et al. 2013; He et al. 2015, 2016), here
we brieﬂy summarize the main features that are most
relevant for the measurement of the binding energy of
molecules to water ice. The experiments were carried
out in a 10 inch diameter ultra-high vacuum chamber
(“main chamber”). A pressure as low as 1.5 × 10−10 torr
is reached routinely after bake-out. During molecule de-
position, the operating pressure is ∼ 3 × 10−10 torr. At
this low pressure, background deposition is negligible. A
1 cm2 gold coated copper disk substrate is located at the
center of the chamber. It can be cooled down to 8 K by
liquid helium or heated to 450 K using a cartridge heater.
A Lakeshore 336 temperature controller with a calibrated
silicon-diode (Lakeshore DT670) is used to measure and
control the substrate temperature with an uncertainty of
less than 0.5 K. A Hiden Analytic triple-pass quadrupole
mass spectrometer (QMS) mounted on a rotary platform
records the desorbed species from the sample or mea-
sures the composition of the incoming beam. A Teﬂon
cone is attached to the entrance of the QMS detector in
order to maximize the collection of molecules desorbed
or scattered from the surface. It has also the function
of rejecting molecules desorbing from other parts of the
sample holder. The QMS is placed at 42° from the sur-
face normal, while the incident angle of the molecular
beam is 8° and on the opposite side—with respect to the
surface normal—of the QMS detector. At the back of
the sample, there is a gas capillary array for water vapor
deposition. The capillary array is not directly facing the
sample holder in order to obtain a deposition of water va-
por from the background. Distilled water underwent at
least three freeze-pump-thaw cycles to remove dissolved
air. A leak valve is used to control the water vapor ﬂow
into the main chamber. Three types of ices are used in
this study, porous amorphous solid water (p-ASW), non-
porous amorphous solid water (np-ASW), and crystalline
water ice (CI). During water vapor deposition, we reg-
ulated the vapor pressure to be ∼ 5 × 10−7 torr, which
corresponds to a deposition rate of 0.5 ML/s. This rate is
close to the slowest deposition rate used by Bossa et al.
(2015). The ice thickness is calculated by integration
of the chamber pressure with time, assuming 1 × 10−6
torr·s exposure corresponds to 1 monolayer (ML). For
experiments carried out in this study, the ice thickness
is 100 ML. Porous amorphous ice is prepared by back-
ground deposition of water vapor when the substrate is
at 10 K, followed by an annealing at 70 K for 30 minutes
and by cooling back down to ∼15 K before the molecules
are deposited on the surface using the molecular beam.
Then in the TPD experiment the temperature of the sur-

face is raised linearly with time and the molecules com-
ing from the surface are detected by the QMS. In the
TPD experiments, the highest surface temperature for
the p-ASW was kept below 70 K in order to maintain
approximately the same surface morphology. Np-ASW
is prepared when the substrate temperature is at 130 K,
followed by annealing at 130 K for 30 minutes. TPD
experiments on np-ASW were performed at a tempera-
ture always below 130 K. CI was prepared by annealing
a np-ASW sample at ∼145 K for 10 minutes. A Fourier
Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) in the RAIRS
(Reﬂection Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy) conﬁgu-
ration is used to check the ice structure. Connected to
the main chamber are two highly collimated three-stage
molecular beam lines. Gas ﬂow into the beam was con-
trolled by an Alicat MCS-5 mass ﬂow controller. In the
third stage of the beam line there is a ﬂag controlled
by a stepper motor to accurately control the beam open-
ing time. An exposure time as short as 0.5 second can be
programmed with an uncertainty of 0.05 second. The list
of TPD experiments are shown in Table 1. The surface
temperature at which the beam deposition takes place
(deposition temperature) was chosen so that the sticking
is unity (He et al. 2016). The NH3 TPD was performed
on crystalline ice because NH3 desorb at temperature
where water ice becomes crystalline.
In the TPD the
highest temperature was set to 145 K, at which the des-
orption of NH3 is complete and water ice evaporation is
still slow.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1. CO Desorption from Porous Amorphous Solid

Water

The TPD spectra of CO from p-ASW are shown in
Figure 1. Compared with TPD spectra in the literature,
this work focuses on the submonolayer regime, especially
on very low coverages. In the ﬁgure, CO coverages varies
from 0.56% ML to 1.33 ML. The coverage is determined
by identifying the transition from submonolayer to mul-
tilayer, similar to the method in Smith et al. (2016). In
the submonolayer regime, the TPD peak temperature
decreases with coverage. At more than 1 ML, the TPD
peak temperature increases with coverage, and shows ze-
roth order desorption with overlapping leading edges. A
shape change is also seen at this transition. For experi-
ments performed in this work, the absolute uncertainty
of coverage determination is about 30%. The coverage of
other traces is obtained accordingly based on the deposi-
tion time. For p-ASW, it takes 30 minutes of CO expo-

sure to fully cover the surface area, while for np-ASW,
only 3 minutes of exposure are needed. This indicates
that the surface area in a 100 ML p-ASW as prepared
in our experimental condition is 10 times as that of np-
ASW. During molecules deposition, the beam intensity
was stable and varies by less than 1%. The sticking co-
eﬃcient may also aﬀect the amount of molecules on the
surface. To eliminate the uncertainty induced by stick-
ing, we set the surface temperature of deposition to be
low enough so that the sticking coeﬃcient during depo-
sition is always unity (He et al. 2016).

3.2. Direct Inversion Method

The TPD traces in Figure 1 share a common trail-
ing edge, which indicates that the diﬀusion rate of CO
is high and equilibrium diﬀusion state is reached dur-
ing the desorption (He & Vidali 2014). Molecules tend
to occupy the deep adsorption sites (with higher bind-
ing energy) before they ﬁll shallow sites (with lower
binding energy).
In this scenario, the direct inversion
method—which is based on particles diﬀusing and oc-
cupying preferably deep adsorption sites—was used pre-
viously (e.g. He & Vidali 2014; Smith et al. 2016) and
works well for extracting the coverage dependent bind-
ing energy distribution. A detailed discussion of the di-
rect inversion method and the diﬀusion process on sur-
face is available in He & Vidali (2014). We start from
the Polanyi-Wigner rate equation; assuming ﬁrst order
desorption, the desorption rate can be written as:

dθ(ED, t)

dt

= −νθ(ED, t) exp(cid:18)−

ED

kBT (t)(cid:19)

(1)

where ν is the desorption pre-exponential factor that de-
pends on the substrate and adsorbate; hereafter we use
a widely accepted value of 1012 s−1; θ(t) is the coverage
deﬁned as percentage of 1 ML, i.e., the number of adsor-
bate particles divided by the number of adsorption sites
on the surface, ED is the binding energy, kB is Boltz-
mann constant, T (t) is the temperature of the surface.
The coverage dependent ED(θ) can be calculated for each
TPD trace as follows:

ED(θ) = −kBT ln(cid:18)−

dt(cid:19)

This inversion is applied to each TPD trace in Figure 1.
The resulting ED(θ) distribution is shown in Figure 2. It

can be seen that the ED(θ) obtained from diﬀerent TPD
traces overlap well; this suggests that the direct inversion
is a reliable method to obtain the binding energy distri-
bution, giving that the trailing edge of the TPD traces
overlap. For easier incoporation of the ED in gas-grain
models, we used a function to ﬁt the ED(θ) distribution:

ED(θ) = E1 + E2 exp(cid:18)−

a

max(b − lg(θ), 0.001)(cid:19) (3)

where E1, E2, a, and b are ﬁtting parameters. E1 is the
binding energy for θ > 1 ML, while E1 + E2 is the bind-
ing energy when θ approaches zero. This function can ﬁt
the binding energy at both the submonolayer and multi-
layer coverage by forcing the multilayer ED(θ) value to
be a constant E1 using the max function. The calculated
binding energy distributions with the ﬁtting function in
Equation 3 are shown in Figure 2. The ﬁtting parameters
are shown in Table 2.

So far we used 1012/s as the prefactor. However, in
other works (i.e., Smith et al. (2016)), diﬀerent values
have been either assumed or obtained from ﬁts.
It is
useful to analyze how diﬀerent prefactors aﬀect the sim-
ulation of interstellar chemistry. For simplicity, we con-
sider an ideal case where the binding energy has a single
value and the TPD peak is sharp. Suppose in a TPD
experiment with a heating ramp rate of 0.5 K/s, a des-
orption peak is at 35 K. From this one can calculate the
binding energy ED using the Polanyi-Wigner equation
and assuming a certain prefactor ν. These values of ED
and ν can then be used in models to predict at what
temperature molecules desorb from the interstellar grain
surface. Since the heating up time scale of a dense cloud
is in the order of 105 years (see below), molecules des-
orb from the grain surface at a lower temperature than

simulated desorption as a function of temperature using
diﬀerent prefactors and heating ramp rates.
It can be
seen that when the prefactor is changed by a factor of
100 (i.e., change from 1012 to 1014), even at the slowest
ramp rate 10−10 K/s the diﬀerence in simulated TPD
peak temperature is less than 1.4 K, which amounts to
7% error. This error is usually smaller than the uncer-
tainty in determining the binding energy. Therefore, the
use of diﬀerent prefactors is not signiﬁcantly aﬀecting the

sumption, considering that for all other species we mea-
sured, it takes 3 minutes of exposure to fully cover the
ﬁrst monolayer of np-ASW surface. The binding energy
can be calculated using Polanyi-Wigner equation to be
2320 K, and it is coverage insensitive. The clustering
behavior of CO2 may help to explain the observed seg-
regation of CO2 in ices ( ¨Oberg et al. 2009). This issue
is still open. Karssemeijer et al. (2014) used a new CO2-
H2O potential to calculate the adsorption properties of
CO2 on amorphous solid water and crystalline ice. They
found no evidence of clustering in contradiction with ex-
periments by Edridge et al. (2013) of CO2 adsorption on
ASW and graphite. The segregation of molecules in wa-
ter ice will be the focus of a forthcoming paper.

Figure 6 shows the TPDs of NH3 from CI. Three dis-
tinct peaks are shown in the TPDs, at ∼ 140 K, ∼ 110 K,
and ∼ 100 K respectively. The 100 K peak is due to ze-
roth order desorption at multilayer coverage. The origin
of the other two peaks is unknown and its explanation is
out of scope of this work. A direct inversion is applied to
the TPD traces and the so obtained binding energy dis-
tribution is shown in Figure 7. This distribution cannot
be ﬁtted with the expression in Eq 3. When the coverage
of NH3 is low, ammonia binds strongly to water ice and
desorbs at a temperature slightly lower than the water
desorption temperature. A more relevant measurement
would be the desorption of NH3 from the surface of a
bare silicate or a carbonaceous material, but this is out-
side the focus of this work.

4. ASTROPHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS

Grain surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the for-
mation of a wide range of molecules including the sim-
plest and most abundant molecule, H2. Once a gas
species adsorbs on the grain surface it will hop on the
surface due its thermal energy. Reactions occur via
Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H), Eley-Rideal (E-L), or hot-
atom (H-A) mechanism (Vidali 2013). Here we only con-
sider the L-H mechanism, i.e., reactants thermally mi-
grate around the grain surface over the diﬀusion energy
barrier Ed between sites until they meet at a binding
site. Migration may also occur due to quantum mechan-
ical tunneling. Initially it was postulated that mobility
of light atoms on a grain surface at low temperature was
due to quantum tunneling, but laboratory experiments
suggest that the thermal hopping plays a bigger role
(Pirronello et al. 1997; Vidali 2013; Hama & Watanabe
2013). The diﬀusion energy barriers deﬁne the rates at
which reactions take place.

The rate of hopping at a given temperature T is given

by:

Ai = νi exp(−ED(i)/kbT ),

simulation of ISM environments, provided that the same
prefactor is used both in laboratory data analysis and in
gas-grain models.

The TPDs of N2 from p-ASW, as well as N2, CO, O2,
CH4 from np-ASW are shown in Figure 4. We again ap-
ply the direct inversion method to each TPD trace from
low coverage up to ∼ 1 ML. Higher coverage curves are
not included in the inversion result because the direct
inversion method is not applicable for multilayer cover-
age. The binding energy distributions and the ﬁttings are
shown on the right panels. For TPDs of O2 and CH4 on
np-ASW in the submonolayer regime, the trailing edges
do not overlap well. Consequently, signiﬁcant gaps are
present in the inverted curves.

The coverage dependent binding energy distribution of
H2 on water ice is very important, since molecular hy-
drogen, as the most abundant molecules in the universe,
plays an fundamental role in the physical and chemical
evolution of interstellar clouds. However, it is very chal-
lenging to measure H2 TPDs especially at low coverage
because of the high background of H2 even in a vacuum
chamber under ultra-high vacuum conditions (P ∼ 10−10
torr). D2 TPDs are typically measured instead. Here we
use the D2 TPDs on np-ASW by Amiaud et al. (2006),
as shown in Figure 8. We follow similar direct inver-
sion procedures as above to obtain the binding energy
distribution, as is shown in Figure 9. The same group
recently performed TPDs of H2, D2, and HD on p-ASW,
and compared the peak temperature diﬀerences between
these three molecules (Amiaud et al. 2015). Based on
Figure 2 in Amiaud et al. (2015), the D2 and H2 des-
orption peaks are at 16 and 14 K, respectively. A cal-
culation of the binding energy turns out that the ratio
ED,H2/ED,D2 = 0.87. We then assume that this ratio
also applies to np-ASW and multiply the D2 binding en-
ergy distribution by 0.87 to represent the binding energy
distribution of H2.

Figure 5 shows the TPDs of CO2 from np-ASW. Ze-
roth order like traces are seen even at very low depo-
sition length,
indicating CO2 forms clusters. Surface
coverage cannot be estimated by identifying the change
in TPD shape.
Instead, we assume that it takes the
same amount CO2 as CO (beam ﬂux times deposition
length) to cover 1 ML surface area. The beam ﬂux is
accurately controlled by the Alicat Mass ﬂow controller
and the correction factor for the speciﬁc gas is already
taken into account by the controller. This is a fair as-

are in the range of 1012–1013 s−1. It should be noted that
in the direct inversion of the TPD traces, the ν value was
taken to be 1012 s−1 for all species. The small diﬀerence
in ν values does not aﬀect the result signiﬁcantly. If one
reactant ﬁnds another during hopping, they will recom-
bine and form a molecule. However sometimes adsorbed
species may desorb back into the gas phase without re-
acting due to variety of desorption mechanisms. The
thermal desorption rate is given by:

Wi = νi exp(−ED(i)/kbT ).

(6)

Thus, ED(i) and Ed(i) are two very crucial parameters
that control grain surface chemistry once a gas phase
species is adsorbed on the surface.

Present day astrochemical model assumes a ﬁxed ED
and Ed for the study of formation of grain surface species.
From the experiments discussed in the previous sections,
it is clear that these parameters are function of coverage.
In the submonolayer regime the binding energy is signif-
icantly higher than in the monolayer regime; the conse-
quence is that while molecules are kept on the grain sur-
face longer, the formation rate is reduced due to slower
hopping. We employed a gas-grain simulation to examine
the impact of the experimental results that are discussed
here. The details of the simulation and chemical net-
works used are given in (He et al. 2016; Acharyya et al.
2015; Acharyya & Herbst 2015).

We ran two classes of models: in one we considered the
old ﬁxed binding energy for CO, N2, O2, CH4, H2 and
atomic oxygen and in another we have used Equation 3
for CO, N2, O2, CH4, H2 and 1850 K for the atomic oxy-
gen binding energy (He et al. 2015). The sticking was
treated the same way as that in He et al. (2016). We ran
six models for each class by varying the density and gas
and grain temperature. Two models for each class were
run by keeping the gas and grain temperature ﬁxed at
10 K. They diﬀer by the initial density; in one we con-
sidered the hydrogen number density (nH) 2 × 104 cm−3
and in other 105 cm−3. We designate these two models as
C1O and C2O (“O” for old energies) and C1N and C2N
(“N” for new energies and Equation 3). Then we ran
another four models (“W” for warm-up) for each class
in which we warmed up the grain and gas and increased
the temperature from 10 K to 200 K at a linear rate.
We have considered two diﬀerent densities, nH = 2 × 104
(W1) and 105 cm−3 (W2) and two diﬀerent heating rates
for increasing the gas and grain temperature from 10 K
to 200 K: fast heating (“F”) in 5 × 104 years and slow
heating (“S”) in 106 years. Thus we have W1FO and
W2FO (fast), W1SO and W2SO (slow) models with old
binding energy and W1FN and W2FN (fast), W1SN and
W2SN (slow) models for which Equation 3 is used.

4.2. Results

In Figure 10 (top), solid curves show the variation of
binding energy as a function of time during the calcu-
lation for the C1N model and dashed lines show ﬁxed
binding energy used for the C1O model. Since both O2
and N2 have the same ﬁxed binding energy (1000 K) in
the C1O model only N2 is shown. For CO, the bind-
ing energy for the C1N model (solid red line) is high up
to 3 × 104 years, and after that it is lower compared to
the ﬁxed binding energy of 1150 K (red dashed line).
For O2 (solid cyan line) and N2 (solid blue line), for all
times the binding energy in the C1N model is higher
than in the C1O model (dashed blue line) which essen-
tially mean that these two species always desorb in the
sub-monolayer regime. The time variation of the CH4
binding energy shows that for time greater than 2 × 104
years, the binding energy (solid magenta line) in model
C1N is lower than in C1O (dashed magenta line). Fig-
ure 10 (bottom), shows the binding energy variation in
the W1FN (solid curves) model. Up to 106 years, the

binding energy proﬁle of all the species is the same as
shown in Figure 10 (top). However, once grains begin to
warm up and the surface abundance decreases below the
monolayer regime, we can see that the binding energy
starts to increase and attains the maximum level that is
sum of E1 and E2.

4.2.1. CO

Figure 11 shows the time variation of CO abundance
for various models. In the top panel the CO abundance
for models C1O, C2O, C1N, and C2N is shown. For
these models the gas and grain temperatures are kept
constant at 10 K (cyan dashed line). In Figure 11a, the
red curve shows the gas-phase CO abundance. When
Equation 3 is used for nH = 2 × 104 cm−3, the CO gas-
phase abundance is signiﬁcantly higher than in the model
with the old and ﬁxed value of the energy (dashed red
curve). This is mainly due to the fact that in the astro-
nomical literature the binding energy for CO is taken as
1150 K (shown in red dashed line in Figure 10a) whereas
when Equation 3 is used the CO binding energy remains
close to 840 K for a time greater than 4 × 104 years, see
Figure 10 (red curve). Thus, most of the time the CO
binding energy is lower than the one used in the liter-
ature. A lower binding energy of CO makes cosmic ray
induced desorption rate (Hasegawa & Herbst 1993) to be
greater than the accretion rate of CO. The net eﬀect is
very little CO depletion. Consequently we can see that
grain surface CO abundance in the C1N model (solid
black line) is lower than in the CIO model (dashed black
line). To investigate this matter further we ran a model
with nH = 105 cm−3. The solid green line shows the
CO gas-phase abundance; after 106 years it starts to go
down much more rapidly than in the previous model but
is still signiﬁcantly lower than in the C2O model (dashed
green line). The solid blue line shows the grain surface

8

He et al.

CO abundance for nH = 105 cm−3; it is still much lower
compared to the one in the C2O model (dashed blue
line).

Figure 11b shows the time variation of the CO abun-
dance for the warm up model with the fast heating rate.
For these models, the gas and grain temperature is kept
constant at 10 K up to 106 years and then is linearly
increased to 200 K in 5 × 104 years. The solid red line
shows the CO gas-phase abundance for the W1FN model;
it is clear that with the W1FO model there is hardly any
change from the warm-up phase to the post warm-up
phase. Once the warm-up process begins and the grain
temperature goes above 20 K, thermal desorption takes
over and becomes the most dominant desorption process;
by 30 K, grain surface CO is completely evaporated back
into gas phase. A similar trend is seen for surface CO.
In Figure 11b the solid red curve (dashed red line) shows
the binding energy variation of CO with time for this
model (old model with ﬁxed 1150 K binding energy). It
is clear that just above 106 years CO attains maximum
binding energy of 1600 K in warm-up models since there
is very little CO on the grain surface.

To understand CO desorption from the sub monolayer
regime during warm up we ran models with a slow heat-
ing rate; the time variation of CO abundance is shown
in the Figure 12. Since the pre-collapse behavior is the
same as shown in the Figure 11, in this plot we only high-
lighted the portion of the curve in which CO is desorbing
due to the warm-up. It can be seen that the gas phase
abundance of CO i.e., solid red line (nH = 2 × 104 cm−3)
and solid green line (nH = 1 × 105 cm−3) for the W1SN
and W2SN models, starts to increase much earlier than
in the W1SO and W2SO models (dashed red and green
line) due to the lower binding energy in the monolayer
regime compared to the ﬁxed binding energy. But once it
desorbed back to the gas-phase, the abundance proﬁle is
very similar. It is clear that grain surface CO abundance
for both the W1SN and W2SN models starts to decrease
earlier than in W1SO and W2SO models but for W1SN
and W2SN models the decrease is much slower and we
see a knee like decrease. This means that a small fraction
of CO is retained up to a much longer time and up to
higher temperature (∼40 K) when the binding energy as
a function of coverage is used. However, when heating
rate is fast the eﬀect is small (Figure 11b).

4.2.2. N2

Figure 13a shows the time variation of N2 for the C2N
and C2O models. Gas phase N2 abundance for the C2N
model (solid green line) remains almost unchanged after
105 years, similarly to the CO abundance proﬁle, whereas
for the C2O model, the abundance goes down initially
slowly and then sharply after 105 years. If we now look
at Figure 10 and compare the binding energy used during
the model run, it is clear that for all times N2 has a
higher binding energy in the C2N model (solid blue line)
than in the C2O model (dashed blue line). Then the
question is why gas-phase N2 is more strongly enhanced
in the new model. Looking at the gas phase formation
pathways of N2 we found that at late times the most
dominant pathway for N2 formation in the C2N model
is via CO + N2H+ where as in the C2O model the most
dominant pathway is N2H+ + e. Thus, a signiﬁcant high

abundance of CO in the C2N model causes an enhanced
abundance of N2. Surface N2 in the C2N model is also
almost constant due to steady accretion from the gas
phase. Figure 13 shows that the gas phase N2 abundance
for W2SN (solid green line) and W2SO (dashed green
line) models is very similar. However, for surface N2,
the desorption starts little later and takes longer time
in model W2SN (solid blue line) due to higher binding
energy compared to the W2SO model (dashed blue line).

4.2.3. O2

Figure 13b shows the time variation of O2 for the C2N
and C2O models. Up to 105 years in both the C2N and
C2O models the gas-phase abundance for O2 is almost
the same. When time is further increased the abundance
of O2 in the C2N model starts to decrease compared to
the C2O model, and above 106 years nearly an order

of magnitude diﬀerence in abundance could be seen be-
tween these two models. It is clear from Figure 10 that
the coverage dependent O2 binding energy is signiﬁcantly
higher compared to the ﬁxed binding energy of 1000 K.
Therefore we see more O2 in the C2O model compared
to the C2N model due to higher non-thermal desorption
rate owing to a lower binding energy. Surface O2 abun-
dance before 2 × 104 years for the C2O model is signiﬁ-

cantly higher than in the C2N model. During this time
the major source of O2 on the grain surface is via O+O
reaction. Due to the very high binding energy of oxygen
in model C2N, there is no O2 formation via this route.
After 105 years the major source of O2 on the grain sur-
face is via accretion from the gas phase. Thus during this
time the O2 surface abundance in C2N and C2O models
is very similar. Once again we see a diﬀerence at time
greater than 106 years. During this time the C2O model
surface O2 abundance is due to the relatively higher ac-
cretion rate caused by the higher gas-phase abundance of
O2 in this model. We can see the same eﬀect for W2SO
and W2SN models in the Figure 14.

4.2.4. CH4

Figure 13c shows time variation of CH4 abundance for
C2N (solid green line) and C2O (dashed green line) mod-
els. Up to 104 years the gas-phase abundance remains
very similar in both models. After that, although the
C2N model abundance remains almost constant, C2O
model abundance starts to decrease up to 105 years and
then begins to increase again after 3 ×105 years. At
very late time the abundance for both models is similar.
The main reasons for this deviation is two-fold. First
for the C2N model, the binding energy used during the
model calculation is lower than the C2O model between
104 and 106 years. Therefore, net depletion in the C2N
model is much lower compared to the C2O model. And
the second reason is that the most dominant gas-phase
formation pathways for CH4 is via reaction with CO and
CH+
5 . Thus more CO in the C2N model will cause more
CH4 formation in this model. Similarly, due to the higher
binding of CH4 in the C2O model there will be less non
thermal desorption in the C2O model; this will cause an
increase in surface CH4 abundance at late times as evi-
dent in Figure 13c (dashed blue line). Figure 14 shows
the CH4 abundance for the W2SN and W2SO models.
We can see clearly that in the W2SN model, as temper-
ature is increased CH4 starts to desorb earlier than in
the W2SO model due to its lower binding energy in the
monolayer regime. On the other hand, although surface
CH4 in the W2SN model also starts to decrease due to
thermal desorption before the W2SO model, owing to its
higher binding energy in the sub-monolayer regime, it
slows down and takes longer time to complete the des-
orption.

5. SUMMARY

In this work we measured the binding energy distribu-
tion of N2, CO, O2, CH4, and CO2 on non-porous amor-
phous solid water (np-ASW), of N2 and CO on porous
amorphous solid water (p-ASW), and of NH3 on crys-
talline water ice down to a fraction of 1% of the layer.
We found that CO2 forms clusters on np-ASW surface
even at very low coverage. This may help to explain the
observed CO2 segregation in ices. The binding energy of
N2, CO, O2, and CH4 decreases with coverage. The en-
ergy values in the low coverage limit are much higher
than those commonly used in gas-grain astrochemical
models. We found a simple empirical formula that gives
the binding energy of a molecule as a function of the cov-
erage. We then used this formula in a simulation of the
time evolution of a dense cloud followed by a warm-up
as appropriate in a hot core or hot corino. We found

that for O2 and N2, desorption takes place from the sub-
monolayer regime for all models we considered, therefore
eﬀective desortion and hopping energies are higher com-
pared to the single energy values used in the current day
astronomical models. For CO and CH4 and for cold cloud
models, initially the eﬀective binding energy remains sig-
niﬁcantly higher; then it gradually decreases to the value
for a monolayer as coverage is increased and remains at
this value till to the end of the simulation. In the warm-
up model, the binding energy increases with grain tem-
perature and attains the maximum value of E1 + E2,
see Table 2. Another important outcome is that during
the slow warm-up, although the desorption process starts
earlier for species like CO and CH4 due to lower value
of binding energy at monolayer regime, it takes longer
time to complete compared to the single value binding
energy due the signiﬁcantly higher sub-monolayer bind-
ing energy. Thus, a fraction of all these ices stays much
longer on the grain surface compared to the case of using
a single value of the binding energy as is currently done
in astrochemical models.
