We generalize the state-of-the-art perturbative Equation of State of cold quark matter to nonzero
temperatures, needed in the description of neutron star mergers and core collapse processes. The
new result is accurate to O(g5) in the gauge coupling, and is based on a novel framework for dealing
with the infrared sensitive soft ﬁeld modes of the theory. The zero Matsubara mode sector is treated
using a dimensionally reduced eﬀective theory, while the soft non-zero modes are resummed using
the Hard Thermal Loop approximation. This combination of known eﬀective descriptions oﬀers
unprecedented access to small but nonzero temperatures, both in and out of beta equilibrium.

INTRODUCTION

The recent discovery of gravitational waves emitted by
two merging black holes by the LIGO and VIRGO col-
laborations has opened up a new observational window
in astrophysics [1]. It is expected that in the near future,
a similar signal will be detected from the merger of two
neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole, or pos-
sibly from a supernova explosion. This would lead to a
wealth of new information about the properties of neu-
tron stars and the matter they are composed of [2], high-
lighting the need to understand the material properties
of dense nuclear matter from its microscopic description.
Figuring out the thermodynamic properties of dense
nuclear and quark matter is a notoriously diﬃcult task,
as it requires a nonperturbative treatment of the the-
ory of strong interactions, QCD, at large baryon chem-
ical potentials µB [3]. At the moment, the Equation of
State (EoS) of zero-temperature nuclear matter is under
quantitative control up to roughly the nuclear saturation
density ns ≈ 0.16/fm3 [4], beyond which it is typically
approximated by a piecewise polytropic EoS [5]. As re-
cently demonstrated in [6, 7], the properties of these poly-
tropes can furthermore be signiﬁcantly constrained using
the perturbative EoS of zero-temperature quark matter
[8], worked out up to and including order g4 = (4παs)2
in the strong coupling constant (see also [9–11]).

For quiescent neutron stars, the approximation of
working at exactly zero temperature is typically rather
good. In the description of violent phenomena, such as
neutron star mergers, thermal corrections to the EoS are,
however, absolutely essential to include, as temperatures
up to ca. 100 MeV may occur [12]. It therefore becomes
necessary to also account for ﬁnite-T eﬀects in the prop-
erties of quark matter using perturbation theory — a
task complicated by physical infrared (IR) divergences.
The underlying reason for these diﬃculties can be under-
stood by considering the medium modiﬁcations that the
dispersion relations of plasma excitations obtain. At one-
loop order, we may think of a generic inverse propagator
obtaining the self-energy correction

−ω2 + k2 → −ω2 + k2 + Π(ω, k).

and the µf stand for the independent quark chemical po-
tentials. For the majority of modes, k (cid:29) mE and medium
modiﬁcation represents only a small perturbation to the
dispersion relation, implying that a “naive” weak cou-
pling (loop) expansion in powers of g2 can be carried out.
For modes with −ω2 + k2 (cid:46) m2
E, this however becomes
an O(1) eﬀect and must be treated nonperturbatively.

Bulk thermodynamic quantities are expanded in zero-
point, or vacuum, diagrams, where ω takes values at dis-
crete imaginary Matsubara frequencies iωn, with ωn =
2πnT for bosons and (2n + 1)πT − iµf for fermions.
It then becomes clear that for T (cid:29) mE, it is only the
bosonic n = 0 mode that must be treated in a nonpertur-
bative way, most straightforwardly implementable using
either the dimensionally reduced (DR) eﬀective theory
Electrostatic QCD (EQCD) [13–15] or the Hard Ther-
mal Loop (HTL) framework [16, 17]. This has allowed
for the derivation of an O(g6 ln g) result for the high-
temperature EoS [11, 18], as well as a signiﬁcant improve-
ment in the convergence properties of the weak coupling
expansion [19–24]. At lower temperatures, in particular
when T becomes of the parametric order mE ∼ gµB, the
situation is, however, qualitatively diﬀerent, and an in-
creasing set of low-lying Matsubara modes needs to be
resummed. This poses a technical problem, which has
been tackled in the regime T ∼ gxµB, x > 1, by the Hard
Dense Loop (HDL) approach, leading to the discovery of
non-Fermi liquid behavior in cold quark matter [25–28].
At present, the only O(g4) result available for the EoS
at all temperatures is based on a tour-de-force resumma-
tion of inﬁnite classes of Feynman graphs, containing the
one-loop gluon polarization tensor of the full theory [29].
This calculation, however, made no use of the fact that
even at low temperatures it is only the soft ﬁeld modes
with k ∼ mE that need to be resummed, or that the
corresponding self-energies obtain their dominant contri-
butions from the hard scale, i.e. from HTL kinematics.

This resulted in a cumbersome numerical result, which
was only worked out for three massless quark ﬂavors at
equal chemical potentials. Due to its complexity, the re-
sult has not lent itself to any phenomenological uses, and
in particular, no high-order EoS applicable to the study
of neutron star mergers presently exists.

In the letter at hand, we demonstrate that making
use of the two eﬀective descriptions for the soft sector
of QCD mentioned above — EQCD and Hard Thermal
Loops — one can formulate a simple framework for de-
termining bulk thermodynamic quantities at all values
of T /µB. This construction is introduced in section II
below, where an explicit EoS, valid up to and includ-
ing O(g5) everywhere, is also derived. The properties
of the result are then discussed in sec. III, and conclu-
sions drawn in sec. IV. Several details of the calculation,
including our notation, are deferred to the Appendices.

II. METHODOLOGY

Consider the weak coupling expansion of the QCD
pressure as a function of the temperature T and the quark
chemical potentials µf . Denoting by pres
QCD an expression
for the quantity, where suﬃcient resummations have been
carried out so that the result contains all physical contri-
butions up to the desired order in g, we may trivially add
soft. This term is deﬁned
and subtract from it a function pres
as the resummed contribution of all soft ﬁeld modes to
soft only
the pressure, such that diﬀerence of pres
contains contributions from the hard modes. This im-
plies that we may evaluate both terms in the diﬀerence
in a naive loop expansion (cf. [30] for a similar trick),
resulting in

(3)

Despite its trivial appearance, this result contains a re-
markable simpliﬁcation, as it expresses the contribution
of the hard modes through a strict weak coupling ex-
pansion, available in the literature [11]. This reduces
the problem of evaluating the desired EoS to the proper
identiﬁcation of the soft sector in need of nonperturbative
treatment, as well as the (hopefully simple) evaluation of
the functions pres

soft and pnaive
soft .

A useful feature of the above formulation is that eq. (3)
is insensitive to the exact deﬁnition of the “soft” sector
as long as it contains all the modes that need to be re-
summed. Should some hard contributions be included in
pres
soft, these terms get automatically subtracted by pnaive
soft ,
removing any possible overcountings from the ﬁnal result.
A minimal description of the soft physics, applicable at
all temperatures and densities, is to handle the static
(n = 0 bosonic) sector via the dimensionally reduced ef-
fective theory EQCD [15], while treating the non-static
modes with k ∼ mE using an HTL expansion [31]. This
allows us to write eq. (3) in the form

pQCD = pnaive

QCD + pres

DR − pnaive

HTL − pnaive

where it is understood that the HTL formulation is only
used for the non-static modes (cf. the sec. II.C for explicit
expressions). In accordance with the discussion of [29],
we will observe that the HTL sector only contributes to
the pressure in the regime of low temperatures, T (cid:46) mE,
and that the DR resummation alone suﬃces for paramet-
rically larger values of T .

A. The naive QCD pressure

As noted above, the term pnaive

QCD is obtainable through
a strict loop expansion of the pressure within the full
theory. Its deﬁnition thereby coincides with that of the
parameter pE of EQCD [15], which has been determined
up to three-loop, or g4, order at all T and µ in [11], uti-
lizing techniques developed in [32]. The result can be
directly read oﬀ from eqs. (3.6)–(3.14) of [11], in which
a typo was later spotted and corrected in [33]. For com-
pleteness, this result is reproduced in appendix B below.
QCD contains both UV
and IR divergences. The UV divergences are removed by
the usual renormalization procedure and are not visible in
eqs. (B2)–(B4). The IR divergences are on the other hand
(explicit
physical, and only cancel against those of pnaive
1/ poles) and pnaive

HTL (ln T terms in the T → 0 limit).

It should be noted that as such, pnaive

B. The dimensionally reduced term

The function pres

DR denotes the contribution of the zero
Matsubara mode sector to the pressure, and can be eval-
uated using a combination of three-dimensional lattice
simulations and a weak coupling expansion within the
eﬀective theory EQCD. It has been determined up to
and including the full g6 order in [34–36], but for con-
sistency we shall only quote the result to O(g5) here, as
other contributions of O(g6) are in any case missing from
our result. This produces the expression

A notable feature of eq. (5) is its explicit UV pole,
which has the same coeﬃcient but an opposite sign as
QCD , cf. eq. (B4). This odd can-
the IR 1/ term of pnaive
celation can be understood through the function pnaive
DR ,
which vanishes in dimensional regularization due to be-
ing expressible in terms of scalefree integrals. Upon closer
inspection, this term is seen to contain both an IR and
a UV divergence, which exactly cancel against those of
pnaive
QCD and pres

DR, respectively.

III. RESULTS

Assembling the results of the previous section, we see

that the QCD pressure takes the form

pQCD = pnaive

QCD + pres

DR + pHTL,

(14)

QCD and pres

DR are given in
where the analytic functions pnaive
eqs. (B1) and (5), respectively, and the numerically de-
termined pHTL in eq. (11) above. Below, we shall brieﬂy
discuss the structure of this expression in two diﬀerent
regimes: T (cid:29) mE and T (cid:46) mE, or high and low temper-
atures, respectively.
High temperatures: When T is parametrically larger
than mE, in particular of O(µB), we see from eqs. (11)
and (13) that the HTL contribution to the pressure be-
comes of O(g6) and is thus no longer interesting for us.
This is a manifestation of the fact that the HTL resum-
mation was only carried out for the non-zero Matsubara
frequencies, which all become hard modes at high T . Re-
DR with
calling further that we may associate pnaive
the functions pE and pM of EQCD, we see that our re-
sult exactly reduces to the known high-temperature one
of [11], worked out up to and including O(g6ln g) there.
Low temperatures: Proceeding to the opposite T → 0
limit, the naive QCD contribution to the pressure re-
duces to the form given by eqs. (B5)–(B7), while the
three terms of pres
DR, visible in eq. (5), are suppressed by
factors of O(T ), O(T 2) and O(T 3), respectively. Adding
to this the ﬁrst orders of the low-temperature expansion
of the HTL contribution, eq. (12), we witness the can-
celation of the ln T terms of pnaive
QCD and pHTL, while the
other terms surviving in the T = 0 limit exactly repro-
duce the well-known result of [9, 11]. The leading correc-

of [11], the green dotted lines for the HDL result of [28], and the single blue dot for the T = 0 limit of [9]. The renormalization
scale ¯Λ has been set to its midpoint value here, speciﬁed in the main text.

tion to this expression turns out not to be of linear order
in T , as the O(T ) contributions to pres
DR and pHTL can-
cel each other, but the lowest nonvanishing corrections
are of O(T 2ln T ). These logarithmic terms and the asso-
ciated non-Fermi liquid behavior have been thoroughly
analyzed in [27, 28]. Interestingly, we may note that at
higher orders in the expansion of the low-T pressure, the
O(g4) correction to m2
E produces a contribution of order
g5T ln T through the ﬁrst term of eq. (5). We expect,
however, that this (formally O(g6)) term gets canceled
by a similar correction to the HTL term of eq. (11); ver-
ifying whether this is indeed the case should constitute a
very interesting exercise.

A crucial feature of our new EoS is that due to its sim-
ple form, it is immediately available for numerical evalua-
tion, and is in addition amenable to a resummation along
the lines of refs. [20, 21, 24] at high temperatures. Study-
ing ﬁrst the generic form of the pressure for Nc = Nf = 3,
we display in ﬁg. 2 the smooth interpolation of our result
between the low-temperature HDL-approximation of [28]
and the high-temperature EQCD result of [11], when the
geometric mean of the scales T and µB/(3π) is set to 0.25
or 1 GeV, and the temperature is gradually increased. In-
terestingly, we note that while at high energy densities
there is a range of temperatures where the low- and high-
T expansions of the pressure agree, this is no longer true
when the numerical value of the coupling is larger.

In ﬁg. 3, we next look at the form of our result for
ﬁxed values of the temperature, T = 50, 100, 150 and
200 MeV. Shown here are also the eﬀects of varying the
MS renormalization scale ¯Λ by a factor of 2 around the
geometric mean of the commonly used µB = 0 and T = 0
scales ¯Λ = 0.723× 4πT [18] and ¯Λ = 2µB/3 [8]. It should
be noted that all results shown here are normalized by the

Finally,

T = 0 non-interacting pressure, which allows for a more
direct inspection of the eﬀects of nonzero temperature.
Also, just like in ﬁg. 2, we have applied here the two-
loop running coupling and the value 378 MeV for ΛQCD.
it should be noted that we have used the
leading-order m2
E in generating both ﬁgs. 2 and 3, im-
plying that in the high-temperature limit there is a rela-
tive O(g5) error in the results. This would be simple to
correct by including the O(g4) correction to m2
E at high
T , but we have found this unnecessary for our present
purposes of studying predominantly low temperatures.

IV. DISCUSSION

It is well-known that small but nonvanishing tempera-
tures pose a serious technical problem for weak coupling
expansions carried out in dense quark matter.
In this
regime, it no longer suﬃces to treat only the static sector
of the theory in a nonperturbative way, but the technical
simpliﬁcations associated with the T = 0 limit are not
available either. While the case of temperatures para-
metrically smaller than the screening scale mE has been
extensively studied in [25–28], a connection to tempera-
tures of parametric order µB has only been established
on a proof-of-principle level [29], and no EoS amenable
to phenomenological applications exists to date.

In the letter at hand, we have addressed the challenge
of small temperatures by formulating a new framework
for high-order weak coupling calculations in deconﬁned
QCD matter. Making use of known eﬀective descriptions
for the static and soft non-static sectors of the theory, we
derived a semi-analytic expression for the EoS, valid up
to and incuding order g5 at all values of T /µB. The fact

FIG. 3: The pressure of deconﬁned quark matter at diﬀerent ﬁxed values of the temperature, with the bands originating from
the variation of the renormalizaation scale ¯Λ as explained in the main text. The results are normalized by the pressure of a
B/(4π), while the dashed blue lines indicate the O(g4) EoS
free Stefan-Boltzmann gas of quarks at zero temperature, pSB = 3µ4
of massless T = 0 quark matter [9, 11].

that our approach utilizes the framework of dimensional
reduction to account for the static sector was shown to
lead to a smooth interpolation of the pressure between
known state-of-the-art results at low and high temper-
atures, as well as to rapid convergence with increasing
T . It is also worth noting that the new result is not re-
stricted to the limit of beta equilibrium, but is a function
of independent quark chemical potentials.

At exactly zero temperature, the state-of-the-art per-
turbative EoS of quark matter [8] has been widely used
to describe the ultradense matter found inside neutron
stars. The present work generalizes this result to nonzero
temperatures, enabling the treatment of systems,
in
which cool deconﬁned matter may be present, such as
stellar mergers. Having derived an EoS immediately
amenable to phenomenological calculations, we leave a
detailed study of such systems, as well as the obvious
extensions of the EoS to nonzero quark masses [37] and
more economical parameterizations [38], for future work.

We note in particular the divergence of p3 in the zero temperature limit, visible in the latter term of the third line.

Appendix C: HTL contribution

In this appendix, we brieﬂy comment on the numerical
evaluation of the HTL integral, eq. (6). It is convenient

to convert the sum over the Matsubara modes to an in-
tegral on the complex ω plane, whereby we arrive at the
relatively compact expressions

The branch cut contributions are on the other hand due
to a cut in the function ΠHTL for |ω| < k, which con-
tributes to the ﬁnal result through

reminiscent of the results of [31]. The only diﬀerence to
the calculation of this reference is that we have explic-
itly removed the zero mode contribution from our sum-
integrals, visible in the third term of eq. (C2).

In both of the above results, the ﬁrst lines originate
from quasiparticle poles and the second ones from branch
cut contributions. In the former terms, the functions ωT/L
denote the transverse and longitudinal plasmon frequen-
cies, satisfying

−ω2 + k2 + ΠT/L(ωT/L(k), k) = 0
