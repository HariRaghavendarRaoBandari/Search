There has been considerable eﬀorts to understand the underlying complex dynamics in physiolog-
ical time series. Methods originated from statistical physics revealed a non-Gaussian statistics and
long range correlations in those signals. This suggests that the regulatory system operates out of
equilibrium. Herein the complex ﬂuctuations in blood pressure time series were successful described
by physiological motivated Langevin equation under a sigmoid restoring force with multiplicative
noise.

Introduction - The autonomic nervous system is able
to maintain life signals at safe levels by the action of a
pair of nerve branches, called sympathetic and parasym-
pathetic. While the sympathetic prepares our body for
”ﬂight or ﬁght” the parasympathetic (or vagal) is con-
sidered as a ”rest and digest” system.
In many cases,
to achieve the homeostatic optimal levels, these systems
have a competitive approach: while one start up an phys-
iological reaction the other one suppress it [1].

Homeostasis depends on the blood ﬂow according to
the metabolic demands of each body part. The exchange
of nutrients and metabolites occurs when blood ﬂows
through capillary channels. The perfusion either into or
out the capillary depends on the blood pressure. Ade-
quate levels of blood pressure are controlled by several
mechanisms that can be classiﬁed according to the re-
sponse delay: the long term and short term control.

In order to maintain homeostasis the body automat-
ically responds to changes. These responses are called
reﬂexes. The principal short term reﬂex regulation of ar-
terial blood pressure is the baroreﬂex. Stretch-sensitive
mechanoreceptors are located in the carotid sinus and
aortic arch connected to the brainstem, or nucleus trac-
tus solitarii, by the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves.
After integrating the aﬀerent signals the central nervous
system, in turn, excite/inhibit the vagal branch if the
pressure is high/low enough, closing the circuit for what
can be regarded as a self-inhibitory feedback [2].

In addition, blood pressure may vary to adapt diﬀerent
physiological conditions such as exercise [3] or pregnancy
[4] and in certain disease states such as hypertension [5].
The optimal level of blood pressure must be risk adjusted:
cannot be high enough to cause structural damage and
cannot be low enough to hinder the nutrient ﬂow.

It has been suggest that the underlying cardiac con-
trol system can be characterized as a complex system.
Indeed, heart and blood pressure present fractal time se-
ries with long range correlations and non-Gaussian dis-
tributions [6] and undergoes a breakdown of critical char-

acteristics like a continous second ordem phase transtion
[7].

In this letter, we propose an analytically tractable
stochastic model for the baroreﬂex that capture the frac-
tality and the non-Gaussian behavior in the blood pres-
sure time series. This model leads to solutions in terms of
the so called q-Gaussians, which is a well known function
in the framework of Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics.
This theory have shown excellent results describing time
series systems with fractal structure and an introduction
and many examples of the theory can be found in [8].

Experiment - Two groups of adult male Wistar rats
were analyzed: control rats and chronic sinoaortic dener-
vated rats, animals surgically denervated 20 days before
measurements. Sinoaortic denervated was performed us-
ing the methods described by Krieger et al [9], and ba-
sically consists of full disruption of the nerve ﬁbers con-
necting the the aﬀerent signals from the baroreceptors to
the brainstem, leading to hypertension, tachycardia, and
an increase in blood pressure lability. Twenty days after
the surgery, only the increase of blood pressure lability
is usually observed [10]. This adaptation had been pre-
viously investigated in the light of detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis [11].

Blood pressure was recorded from the left femoral
artery for 90 minutes in conscious rats. Before the ana-
log to digital conversion, blood pressure was low-pass
ﬁltered (fc= 50 Hz) for high-frequency noise removal,
and recorded with a 2kHz sampling frequency. Diastolic
(minimum) values were detected after parabolic interpo-
lation and signal artifacts were visually identiﬁed and
removed. A more detailed account of this experiment
can be found in [10]. Since the measurements were done
in awake conscious unrestrained rats some distortions in
the blood pressure signal arise due to their movements.
To reduce this problem we discard series that show any
kind of discontinuities.

FIG. 1. Representative data of diastolic blood pressure from
one animal. (a) a typical diastolic blood pressure record is
presented. (b) The histogram for the blood pressure values.
A Gaussian distribution (black dash-line) with sample mean
and sample variance was plotted with the histogram, high-
lighting the non-Gaussian behavior.
(c) DFA for diastolic
blood pressure series. For long time scales the DFA expo-
nent is α = 0.93. We also applied DFA to shuﬄed data (red
up triangles) obtaining α ≈ 0.5. The curves α = 0.5 (red full
line), 0.9 (blue full line) are plotted as guides to the eye.

Results and Discussion - Figure 1a a typical diastolic
blood pressure record from a control animal is presented.
The histogram for the blood pressure values is presented
in ﬁgure 1c. A Gaussian distribution with sample mean
and sample variance was plotted with the histogram,
highlighting the non-Gaussian behavior. Furthermore,
it clearly presents a positive skew. Despise the fact that
the time series has a constant mean of 81.00mmHg over
a range of 104 inter-beats, a complex pattern of ﬂuc-
tuations were observed. To characterize the stochastic
dynamics of the blood pressure a detrended ﬂuctuation
analysis (DFA) was performed. The log-log plot of the
ﬂuctuation function F (n) is presented in ﬁgure 1b. A
crossover around n = 35 separate two diﬀerent behav-
iors. For long time scales the DFA exponent α = 0.93
while a for short time scales α = 1.18. This crossover
had been discussed previously and it could be associated
with autonomic nervous system control of arterial blood
pressure [11, 12]. To conﬁrm the presence of long range
correlations, the time series were randomly shuﬄed and
DFA was applied. The shuﬄed time series present DFA
exponent α ≈ 0.5, as typical white noise, show at ﬁgure
1b in red, which demonstrates that long range correla-
tions arises from the blood pressure control system.

External perturbations are continuously disrupting the
cardiac system. In such noisy environment the autonomic

2

nervous system must keep the blood pressure at accept-
able levels by integrating chemical and mechanical input
from aﬀerents to regulate the blood pressure. However,
the neural transmission itself is noisy [13]. Information
transmission along the axons is made by electrical signals.
Those signals, called action potentials, are created by ion
channels in a cell membrane. They travel down the axon
to its end where the neurotransmitters are release in the
synaptic gap. Those transmitters activate receptors in
the post synaptic neuron [14]. The noise source are di-
verse, for example, they could have physical background
in thermodynamic or quantum mechanics, as it happens
with sensor neurons, or could be built up in the cellular
network [15].
In this sense, the cardiac neural control
system is under intrinsic and extrinsic noise.

FIG. 2. Semi log histogram of rescaled experimental dias-
tolic pressure data. Figure 2a present the data of four con-
trol rats while ﬁgure 2b shows the data of four denervated
animals. All data where rescaled ps = k0(p − ˜p)/σ, where
k0 = 4, p is the blood pressure data, ˜p is the median and
σ is the sample standard deviation. Despite the fact that
the animals were unrestrained during the measurement, the
rescaled data collapse. In each ﬁgure the stable solution of
the model where plotted. For the control animals, ﬁgure 2a,
a q-Gaussian distribution with q = 11/9 were found. For
the denervated rats,ﬁgure 2b, a almost Gaussian distribution
were found with q = 1.04.

Synaptic signal transmission is found to be modeled
as a diﬀusive process wherein additive and multiplicative
noise plays relevant role to describe the neuronal response
[16, 17]. Let p = P − ˜p where P is the blood pressure
and ˜p is a measure of central tendency, like the mean or
the median. Then the neural control of blood pressure
dynamics could be modeled as a Brownian particle under
a restoring force of the baroreﬂex:

dp
dt

= f (p) + g(p)ξ(t) + η(t).

(1)

where f (p) is the restoring force, g(p) is the diﬀusion co-
eﬃcient, ξ(t) is the multiplicative noise and η(t) is the ad-
ditive noise. They both have zero mean and show Marko-
vian correlations, hξtξt′ i = M δtt′ and hηtηt′i = Rδtt′.

Physiologically η(t) could be interpreted as external per-
turbations on cardiac system while g(p)ξ(t) is a noise
arising from the neural transmission.

Harris and Wolpert [18] propose an unifying optimal
control theory for information process in motor systems.
The theory is based on a single physiological assump-
tion: the neural noise increases in variance with the size
of the control signal. This assumption is then made by
the model presented in this paper. Here the noise am-
plitude is signal dependent and it is proportional to the
control system. Several complex systems, like ﬁnancial
and turbulence [19, 20], has a linear drift coeﬃcient and a
quadratic state-dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient. In those
system f (p) = − dU(p)
and g2(p) ∝ U (p). Analogously,
dp
the restoring force of the baroreﬂex could be expressed
as above with U (p) = τ
2 g(p)2.Generally the baroreﬂex is
represented by a sigmoid function [21], f (p) = A− C
1+e−Bp
where A, B, C are the model parameters. Integrating the
τ h−Ap + C ln(1+eBp)
i
sigmoid one can found g2(p) = 2
where A < C, A > 0, and B > 0 must hold that g2(p)
be strictly positive.

Equation (1) could be rewritten as Fokker-Planck

equation using Ito calculus:

(2)
where G(p) = R+M g2(p), G′(p) = ∂G(p)
and F (p) is the
arterial blood pressure distribution. The physiologically
viable solution for equation 2 must have F (p → ∞) = 0
as boundary condition. In those conditions, equation 2
has a q-Gaussian distribution as stationary solution [22]:

F (p) = N (cid:2)1 − (1 − q)βg(p)2(cid:3)

By replacing equation 3 in equation 2, we obtain:

If gg ′ = 0 implies f (p) = 0 for some p∗. As A < C and
B > 0 then p∗ = − 1
A − 1) > 0. The positive value of
p∗ is associated with the continuous action of the sympa-
thetic activity when not inhibited. In other words, when
the blood pressure is near the central value there is an
continuous activity, called sympathetic tone, of the ner-
vous system to increase the blood pressure. Otherwise, if
gg ′ 6= 0, equation 4 must hold for every p, which implies
q = 2 − 1
. If coupling constant
τ is larger than multiplicative noise amplitude such as
M/τ → 0 then q → 1 and F (p) converge to Gaussian
distribution. The multiplicative noise becomes too small
and the long tail vanish. On the other hand, if M/τ → ∞
q → 2 and F (p) converges to the Lorentz distribution [23]

destroying homeostasis. In spite of q-Gaussian distribu-
tion are deﬁned for q < 3, to describe the non-Gaussian
behavior observed in ﬁgure 1c and keep the physiological
feasibility, q must stick in between 1 and 2.

To compare the proposed model with the experimen-
tally observed diastolic blood pressure data, a rescale
transformation where performed: ps = k0(p−˜p)/σ, where
k0 = 4, p is the blood pressure, ˜p is it median and σ
is it standard deviation. Once the animals were unre-
strained, each BP series could shown diﬀerent central
values and variability. However, when the rescale where
performed the data collapse as ﬁgure 2 shows.
In the
same ﬁgure the stable solution of the model, equation
3, where plotted. For control animals, ﬁgure 2a, the
following parameters were used: τ = 21/5, M = 6/5,
A = 7/5, B = 2/5, and C = 9/5. These values imply-
ing q = 11/9 ≈ 1.22. A value of q = 1.26 ± 0.1 where
observed in heart rate variability [24]. Several other non-
equilibrium systems presents q = 1.22,for example, ﬁna-
cial markets [25], hadron-hadron collisions [26], and geo-
logical faults [27]. For surgically disrupted animals, pre-
sented at ﬁgure 2b, the following parameters were used:
τ = 26/5, M = 1/5, A = 1, B = 1/5, and C = 9/5.
These values implying q = 1.04, very close to the Gaus-
sian distribution (q = 1.0), showing that the non Gauss-
sian ﬂuctuations are intrinsicly associated with the con-
trol feedback loop at short time scale.

To characterize quantitatively the dynamics, a Monte
Carlo simulation of the equation 1 were performed for
both group. The same parameters of the analitical curves
in ﬁgure 2 were used. To understand how the model could
reproduce the underlying dynamics a DFA of the simu-
lated series were compared with the blood pressure real
data. As recently discussed DFA could present a biased
estimator for the Hurst exponent [28]. Nevertheless it
still holding as good methodology to work on real data
[29], and any bias that could be introduced in the ﬂuctu-
ation function will happens on both time series, the real
and the simulated one, being no hindrance to the analy-
sis. The results of the DFA for synthetic series and real
data is presented in ﬁgure 3. The time scales of the blood
pressure control feedback loop is commonly analyzed in
three diﬀerent ranges: high , low and very low frequency
. The baroreﬂex plays a signiﬁcant role at high and low
frequency control [30].

After 20 days, since major damages were inﬂicted on
the neural circuit responsible for the baroreﬂex, the con-
trol were achieved by some other redundant mechanism
but with larger response delay [11]. Figure 3 shows the
model captures the ﬂuctuations behavior in the barore-
ﬂex control range for both groups. Time scales larger
than n > 500 are in the very low frequency range and
the model developed here plays no role. However, except
for long time scales, the ﬂuctuation functions reveals a
very similar pattern between synthetic and experimen-
tal time series. Based on this analysis, we conclude the

FIG. 3. Comparison between DFA analysis of the experimen-

1. The experimental data for four diﬀerent animals of each
group are plotted with open symbols (purple (cid:3), green ◦, black

with red ×. The curves were translated for better visibility,
and values of F (n) are vertically shifted.
In ﬁgure 3a the

is presented. The model capture the ﬂuctuations behavior
until the n ≈ 500 for both groups. The error bars represent
the standard deviation over 1000 simulations.

model presented here captures the complex behavior of
blood pressure control.

A langevin model based on a sigmoidal restoring force
with multiplicative noise for the diastolic blood pressure
time series was discussed. The stationary solution was
a q-Gaussian distribution with q = 11/9 that describes
remarkably well the blood pressure time series recorded
from femoral artery for 30 minutes in conscious uncon-
strained rats. To investigate the model dynamics a syn-
thetic time series was generated by a monte carlo simula-
tion of the equivalent Langevin equation. The synthetic
time series and the experimental data was characterized
using DFA and the ﬂuctuation functions were compared.
The ﬂuctuation functions reveals a very similar pattern
in the synthetic and experimental time series for high and
low frequency.
