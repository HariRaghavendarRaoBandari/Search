The neutrino mass hierarchy is one of the neutrino fundamental properties yet

to be determined. We introduce a method to determine neutrino mass hierarchy
by comparing the interaction rate of neutral current (NC) interactions, ν(ν) + p →
ν(ν) + p, and inverse beta decays (IBD), ¯νe + p → n + e+, of supernova neutrinos in
scintillation detectors. Neutrino ﬂavor conversions inside the supernova are sensitive

to neutrino mass hierarchy. Due to Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein eﬀects, the full

swapping of ¯νe ﬂux with the ¯νx (x = µ, τ ) one occurs in the inverted hierarchy,

while such a swapping does not occur in the normal hierarchy. As a result, more

high energy IBD events occur in the detector for the inverted hierarchy than the high

energy IBD events in the normal hierarchy. By comparing IBD interaction rate with

the mass hierarchy independent NC interaction rate, one can determine the neutrino

mass hierarchy.

INTRODUCTION

2

With almost two decades of eﬀorts, a considerable progress in constraining the neutrino

mixing parameters has been achieved [1, 2], based on various oscillation experiments with

atmospheric, solar, and terrestrial neutrinos [3]. It is now well established that the ﬂavor

states νe, νµ, and ντ are superpositions of the vacuum mass eigenstates ν1, ν2, and ν3 [4] and
2 − m2
the three mixing angles, θ12, θ23, and θ13, and two mass-squared diﬀerences, ∆2
1
and ∆2
1 are well constrained. However, the neutrino mass hierarchy, i.e., the
1, remains undetermined. Although various
techniques have been proposed to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy, this question remains

open to date and represents an important challenge in particle physics. Recent eﬀorts on

resolving the neutrino mass hierarchy include works based on reactor neutrinos [5–8] diﬀerent

baseline experiments [9], Earth matter eﬀects on supernova (SN) neutrino signal [10, 11],

spectral swapping of SN neutrino ﬂavors [12], rise time of SN νe light curve [13], νe and ¯νe

light curves on the early accretion phase [14], analysis of meteoritic SN material [15], and

detection of atmospheric neutrinos in sea water or ice [16].

Among the research works to identify neutrino mass hierarchy, intensive eﬀorts have been

devoted to studying neutrinos from galactic SNe. As these neutrinos propagate outward,

they can experience signiﬁcant ﬂavor transitions before arriving at the terrestrial detectors.

The ﬂavor conversions caused by the well-known Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW)

eﬀect [17, 18] depends on the neutrino mass hierarchy. In addition, it has been suggested
that, due to the large neutrino number density in the deep region of the core, coherent ν − ν
forward scatterings may lead to collective ﬂavor conversion νe¯νe ↔ νx¯νx (x = µ, τ ) over the
entire energy range. This collective eﬀect on the ﬂavor transition of SN neutrinos depends

crucially on the neutrino mass hierarchy and may also leaves imprints on the neutrino

spectra.

Most of the methods that use SN neutrinos for determining the neutrino mass hierarchy

are based on the interactions of these neutrinos with atomic nuclei and free protons. The
major interaction channel for neutrino detection is the inverse beta decay (IBD), ¯νe + p →
n + e+. While the liquid scintillation detector is sensitive to ¯νe, the liquid argon detector
has a good sensitivity to νe via charged-current interactions 40Ar + νe →40 K∗ + e−. While
νe and ¯νe spectra have been intensively studied in exploring SN physics, the potential of

3

other species of SN neutrinos is much less discussed. The detection of other species was also
proposed by measuring the neutral-current (NC) interactions, ν + p → ν + p [19, 20]. It has
been shown that, under fairly optimistic assumption about the detector and SN neutrino

ﬂux, signals due to νp elastic scatterings at scintillation detectors allow one to reconstruct
νx spectrum and measure total neutrino energy to a precision ≤ 10% [20].

In this work, we introduce an approach to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy, based

on the interactions of SN neutrinos with free protons in scintillation detectors. The method is

to explore how the inverse beta decays and neutral current interactions in single scintillation

detector are related with respect to the neutrino mass hierarchy. We provide calculations

with contemporary inputs for several detectors: the presently-running Borexino [21–25] and

KamLAND [26, 27], the near-term SNO+ [28–30], and the much larger proposed JUNO

[31, 32] and LENA [33, 34].

The paper is organized as follow. In Sec. II, we review the supernova neutrino ﬂuence.

The ﬂavor transitions of SN neutrinos are discussed as they propagate outward from the

deep inside the supernova and traverse the Earth medium to reach the detector. In Sec. III,

we deﬁne interaction spectra of inverse beta decay and neutral current and illustrate how to

derive the interactions spectra from observations of scintillation detectors. Then we present

our calculations for considered detectors with statistical uncertainties addressed in Sec. IV.

We summarize and conclude in Sec. V.

II. SUPERNOVA NEUTRINO FLUENCE

A. Primary Neutrino Fluence

A SN emits a total energy E ≈ 1053 erg over a burst ∆t ≈ 10s in neutrinos of all six ﬂavors.
The neutrino ﬂavors νµ, ντ and their antiparticles have similar interactions and thus similar
average energies and ﬂuences. Therefore, the total energy is divided as E = Eνe +E¯νe + 4Eνx.
In general, equipartition of energies among the primary neutrino ﬂavors is expected in typical
SN simulations, Eνe ≈ E¯νe ≈ Eνx and also Lνe ≈ L¯νe ≈ Lνx for luminosities, which is assumed
in our calculation. The primary SN neutrino energy spectrum is typically not purely thermal.

We adopt a Keil parametrization [35] for the neutrino ﬂuence

with Eα in units of 1052 erg, d in 10 kpc, and energies in MeV. For the numerical evaluations,
we take a representative supernova at the Galactic center region with d = 10 kpc, and a
total energy output of E = 3 × 1053 erg, i.e., Eα = 5 × 1052 erg for each of the 6 ﬂavors.
Further, we choose < Eνe >= 12 MeV, < E¯νe >= 15 MeV, and < Eνx >= 18 MeV.

B. Neutrino Flavor Transition inside SN

Our knowledge on the neutrino ﬂavor transition in a core-collapse SN suggests that the

ﬂavor conversion can be induced by the collective neutrino oscillation [36–44] (see [45] for a
review) and MSW eﬀect. The collective oscillation results from the coherent ν − ν forward
scatterings in the deep region of the core where neutrino densities are large and may lead
to collective pair conversion νe¯νe ↔ νx¯νx (x = µ, τ ) over the entire energy range even with
extremely small mixing angles. The MSW eﬀect, instead, arise from neutrino interaction

with ordinary stellar medium. In a typical SN, the collective ﬂavor conversions would take
place near r ∼ 103 km while those of MSW type would take place at r ∼ 104−105 km. As the
collective and MSW eﬀects are widely separated, they can be considered to be independent

of each other.

Recently, substantial progress has been made on the studies of neutrino collective ﬂavor

conversions. The most prominent feature arising from collective neutrino oscillations is the

spectral swap/split. Analytical and numerical works have shown [36, 46] that collective

eﬀects not only depend on neutrino parameters, SN environments, and primary neutrino

spectra but also subject to the oscillation modes and simulation approaches one has chosen.

However, recent study based on multi-angle analysis of SN neutrinos [47, 48] found that the

seemingly dominating collective eﬀects may be suppressed by the dense matter during the

accretion phase following the core bounce [49].

Unlike the status of MSW eﬀects, consensus on collective ﬂavor transitions has not yet

5

been reached. To avoid digression to diverse scenarios of the collective eﬀect, we assume

that MSW eﬀect dominates the ﬂavor conversions while SN neutrinos propagate outward

during the accretion phase. We will also neglect the complicated eﬀects during the cooling

phase since we are interested in the time-integrated ﬂux.

C. Neutrino Fluence on Earth

As neutrinos propagate outwards from deep inside SN and ﬁnally reaches the Earth, their

ﬂavor contents are modiﬁed by the MSW eﬀect. Let us denote the survival probability for
νe( ¯νe) after the MSW eﬀect as P ( ¯P ). Then, the ﬂuxes of νe and ¯νe arriving at the detector
can be written as:

Fe = P F 0
F¯e = ¯P F 0

e + (1 − P )F 0
x ,
¯e + (1 − ¯P )F 0
¯x ,

with

P = P1ePHPL + P2e(PH − PHPL) + P3e(1 − PH),
¯P = ¯P1e(1 − ¯PL) + ¯P2e

¯PL,

for the normal hierarchy, and

P = P1ePL + P2e(1 − PL),
¯PH(1 − ¯PL) + ¯P2e
¯P = ¯P1e

¯PH

¯PL + ¯P3e(1 − ¯PH),

(8)

for the inverted hierarchy. Here, PH ( ¯PH) and PL ( ¯PL) are the crossing probabilities for the
neutrino (antineutrino) eigenstates at higher and lower resonances, respectively. Pie ( ¯Pie) is
the probability that a mass eigenstate νi (¯νi) is observed as a νe (¯νe) since neutrinos arrive

at the Earth as mass eigenstates. With the recent determination of the relatively large θ13,
the ﬂavor crossings are adiabatic and the vanishing crossing probabilities PH (cid:39) ¯PH (cid:39) PL (cid:39)
¯PL (cid:39) 0 can be adopted [50]. The ﬂuxes then become

21 = 7.54 × 10−5 eV2, which are best ﬁt values
trajectories. We take sin2 θ12 = 0.308 and ∆2

for the normal and inverted hierarchies, respectively.

III. SPECTRUM FOR INVERSE BETA DECAY AND NEUTRAL CURRENT

From Eq. (9) to (12), it is shown that, in the normal hierarchy, νe completely comes

from ν0

x from the source while ¯νe comes from both ¯ν0

x. On the other hand, in the

is also shown that Earth matter eﬀects occur on ¯νe in the normal hierarchy and νe in the

inverted hierarchy.

In this section, we discuss interactions of SN neutrinos in liquid scintillation detectors. In

scintillation detectors, inverse beta decays (IBD) are the most dominant interactions. The

yield of νp elastic scatterings is also comparable to that of IBD due to the large number of

free protons [20]. The interaction spectra are given as

Here Np is the number of the target protons in the detector and Ftot ≡ Fe + F¯e + 4Fx is
the total ﬂuence of the SN neutrinos. NC denotes νp elastic scatterings for they are neutral

current interactions.

We note that the interaction spectra, Eq. (16) and (17), account for the number of IBD

and NC interactions occur inside the detector per energy of incident SN neutrinos. They

are not the observed event spectra but can be constructed from the observed spectra.

The observed event spectrum, dN/dEe+, for IBD is obtained in scintillation detectors
by measuring the positron energy deposit. To a good approximation, one has Ee+ = Eν −
In the supernova energy regime, this
1.3 MeV for Eν < 300 MeV as indicated in [53].

allows the event spectrum dN/dEe+ to be directly converted to the interaction spectrum

(dN/dEν)IBD with cross section σIBD(Eν) taken from [53].

SN neutrinos interact with free protons in the detector through neutral current elastic

scattering, producing protons with recoil kinetic energies T . To produce a proton recoil

energy T requires a minimum neutrino energy Eν,min =(cid:112)mpT /2, where mp is the proton

mass. In other words, a neutrino of energy Eν can produce a proton recoil energy between 0
and Tmax = 2E2
ν /mp. These protons are slow hence they are detected with quenched energies
T (cid:48) < T . The proton recoil energy T is mapped to an electron-equivalent quenched energy

A measured T (cid:48) corresponds to a unique T using the known quenching function. The energy

spectrum dN/dT (cid:48) is measured, one can extract the neutrino ﬂuence dF/dE with the inversion
