ON THE DENSITY OF CYCLOTOMIC LATTICES

CONSTRUCTED FROM CODES

PHILIPPE MOUSTROU

Abstract. Recently, Venkatesh improved the best known lower bound for
lattice sphere packings by a factor log log n for inﬁnitely many dimensions n.
Here we prove an eﬀective version of this result, in the sense that we exhibit,
for the same set of dimensions, ﬁnite families of lattices containing a lattice
reaching this bound. Our construction uses codes over cyclotomic ﬁelds, lifted
to lattices via Construction A.

1. Introduction

The sphere packing problem in Euclidean spaces asks for the biggest proportion
of space that can be ﬁlled by a collection of balls with disjoint interiors having the
same radius. Here we focus on lattice sphere packings, where the centers of the
balls are located at the points of a lattice, and we denote by ∆n the supremum of
the density that can be achieved by such a packing in dimension n. Let us recall
that the exact value of ∆n is known only for dimensions up to 8 [CSB87] and for
dimension 24 ([CK09]). For other dimensions, only lower and upper bounds are
known. Moreover, asymptotically, the ratio between these bounds is exponential.

Here we focus on lower bounds. The ﬁrst important result goes back to the
ζ(n)
celebrated Minkowski-Hlawka theorem [Hla43], stating the inequality ∆n >
2n−1
for all n, where ζ(n) denotes the Riemann zeta function. Later, Rogers [Rog47]
cn
2n for every n > 1,
improved this bound by a linear factor: he showed that ∆n >
with c ≈ 0.73. The constant c was successively improved by Davenport and Rogers
[DR47] (c = 1.68), Ball [Bal92] (c = 2) and Vance [Van11] (c = 2.2 when n is
divisible by 4). Recently Venkatesh has obtained a more dramatic improvement

[Ven13], showing that for n big enough, ∆n >

. Most importantly, he

, thus improving for

Unfortunately, all these results are of existential nature: their proofs are non
constructive by essence, due to the fact that they generally use random arguments
over inﬁnite families of lattices. It is then natural to ask for eﬀective versions of
these results. It is worth to explain what we mean here by eﬀectiveness. Indeed,

designing a practical algorithm, i.e running in polynomial time in the dimension,
to construct dense lattices appears to be out of reach to date. More modestly, one
aims at exhibiting ﬁnite and explicit sets of lattices, possibly of exponential size, in
which one is guaranteed to ﬁnd a dense lattice.

In this direction, the ﬁrst to give an eﬀective proof of Minkowski-Hlawka theorem
was Rush [Rus89]. Later, Gaborit and Zémor [GZ07] provided an eﬀective analogue
of Roger’s bound for the dimensions of the form n = 2p with p a big enough prime
number. In both constructions, the lattices are lifted from codes over a ﬁnite ﬁeld,
and run in sets of size of the form exp(kn log n), with k a constant.

Let us now explain with more details two ingredients that play a crucial role in
the proofs of the results above. The ﬁrst one is Siegel’s mean value theorem [Sie45]
which in particular states that, on average over the set L of n-dimensional lattices
of volume 1,

EL[|B(r) ∩ (Λ \ {0})|] = Vol(B(r)).

It follows that, if Vol(B(r)) < 1, then there exists a lattice Λ ∈ L such that
B(r) ∩ (Λ \ {0}) = ∅, i.e such that the minimum norm µ of its non zero vectors is
greater than r. The density of the sphere packing associated to Λ then satisﬁes

∆(Λ) =

Vol(B(µ))

2n

>

1
2n .

It is worth to point out that the same reasoning holds if Vol(B(r)) < 2, because
lattice vectors of given norm come by pairs {±x}. From this simple remark we get

2
2n ,
which is essentially Minkowski-Hlawka bound.

∆n >

The second idea follows almost immediately from the previous observation: con-
sidering lattices aﬀording a group of symmetries larger than the trivial {±Id} should
allow to replace the factor 2 in the numerator by a greater value. To this end, one
needs a family of lattices, invariant under the action of a group, for which an ana-
logue of Siegel’s mean value theorem holds. This idea is exploited in [GZ07], [Van11]
and [Ven13]. In particular, this is how Venkatesh obtains the extra log log n term,
by considering cyclotomic lattices, i.e lattices with an additional structure of Z[ζm]-
modules. It turns out that, for a suitable choice of m, one can ﬁnd such lattices in
dimension n = O(

m

).

log log m

In this paper, we consider cyclotomic lattices constructed from codes, in order
to deal with ﬁnite families of lattices. To be more precise, the codes we take are the
preimages through the standard surjection associated to a prime ideal P of Q[ζm]

Z[ζm]2 → (Z[ζm]/P)2

of all one dimensional subspaces over the residue ﬁeld Z[ζm]/P.

Our approach is simpler and more straightforward than the previous ones in
several respects. On one hand, the analogue of Siegel’s mean value theorem in our
situation boils down to a simple counting argument on ﬁnite sets (see Lemma 4).
On the other hand, the group action, which is, as in [GZ07], that of a cyclic group,
is in our case easier to deal with, because it is a free action. As a consequence, we
can cope with arbitrary orders m, while Gaborit and Zémor only consider prime
orders.

Our main theorem is an eﬀective version of Venkatesh’s result:

2

Theorem 1. For inﬁnitely many dimensions n, a lattice Λ such that its density
∆(Λ) satisﬁes

∆(Λ) >

0.89n log log n

2n

can be constructed with exp(7.8n log n(1 + o(1)) binary operations.

This result follows from a more general analysis of the density on average of the
elements in the families of m-cyclotomic lattices described above, see Theorem 2
and Proposition 1 for precise statements.

A lattice Λ is said to be symplectic if there exists an isometry σ exchanging
Λ and its dual lattice, and such that σ2 = −Id. Symplectic lattices are closely
related to principally polarized Abelian varieties. In [Aut15], Autissier has adapted
Venkatesh’s approach to prove the existence of symplectic lattices with the same
density. We show that, with some slight modiﬁcations, our construction leads to
symplectic lattices, thus providing an eﬀective version of Autissier’s result (see
Theorem 3 and Corollary 2 ).

The article is organized as follows: Section 2 recalls basics notions about lattices
and cyclotomic ﬁelds, and introduces the construction of cyclotomic lattices from
codes. In Section 3 we state and prove the main results discussed above. Section 4
is dedicated to the case of symplectic lattices.

2. Notations and preliminaries

2.1. Lattices in Euclidean spaces. Let E be a Euclidean space equipped with
the scalar product h,i. We denote by ||.|| the norm associated to this scalar product,
by n the dimension of E, and by B(r) the closed ball of radius r in E:

By Stirling formula, we have

B(r) = {x ∈ E,||x|| 6 r}.

A lattice Λ ∈ E is a free Z-module of rank n (for a general reference on lattices,
see e.g [CSB87]). A fundamental region of Λ is a region R ⊂ E such that for any
λ 6= λ′ ∈ Λ, the measure of (λ + R) ∩ (λ′ + R) is 0, and E = [λ∈Λ
(λ + R). The
volume Vol(Λ) of Λ is deﬁned as the volume of any of its fundamental region. The
Voronoi region of Λ is the particular fundamental region:

We denote by µ the minimum of Λ:

V = VΛ = {z ∈ E,∀ x ∈ Λ,||z − x|| > ||z||}.

µ = µΛ = min{||x||, x ∈ Λ \ {0}}

3

and by τ its covering radius:

τ = τΛ = sup
z∈E

x∈Λ||z − x||.
inf

Taking balls of radius µ/2 centered at the points of Λ, we get a packing in E, i.e a
set of spheres with pairwise disjoint interiors. The density of this packing is given
by

∆(Λ) =

Vol(B(µ))
2n Vol(Λ)

.

Finally, we deﬁne Λ#, the dual lattice of the lattice Λ:

Λ# = {x ∈ E,∀ y ∈ Λ,hx, yi ∈ Z}.

2.2. Cyclotomic ﬁelds. Let K be the cyclotomic ﬁeld Q[ζm], where ζm is a prim-
itive m-th root of unity. This is a totally imaginary ﬁeld of degree φ(m) over Q.
Let us deﬁne KR = K ⊗Q R. The trace form tr(xy) where tr denotes the trace
form of the number ﬁeld K induces a scalar product on KR, denoted by h,i, giving
KR the structure of a Euclidean space of dimension φ(m). We refer to [Was97] for
general properties of cyclotomic ﬁelds.

For every fractional ideal A, we will use the same notation A for the lattice in
KR which is the image of A under the natural embedding K → KR. We will need
informations about lattices deﬁned by fractional ideals of K.
The volume of OK is by deﬁnition the square root of the absolute value of the
discriminant dK of K. It is well known (e.g [Was97]) that for the cyclotomic ﬁelds

(2)

mφ(m)
lφ(m)/(l−1)

|dK| =

Yl∈P

l|m

where P is the set of prime numbers.

It is easy to see that the minimum of OK is pφ(m): indeed ||1|| =pφ(m) and
the arithmetic geometric inequality gives ||x|| > pφ(m) for all x ∈ OK. For the

minimum and the covering radius of general fractional ideals, we will apply the
following estimates:

Lemma 1 ([Flu06], propositions 4.1 and 4.2.). Let A be a fractional ideal of K,
where K is a number ﬁeld of degree n over Q. Then we have :

2.3. Cyclotomic lattices constructed from codes. A standard construction of
lattices lifts codes over Fp to sublattices of Zn, this is the well known Construc-
tion A (see [CSB87, Chapter 7]). Here we will deal with a slightly more general
construction in the context of cyclotomic ﬁelds.

Let us consider as before K = Q[ζm] and KR the Euclidean space associated
with K. Let P be a prime ideal of OK lying over a prime number p which does not
divide m. Then the quotient F = OK/P is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of cardinality q = pf .

induced on the sφ(m)-dimensional R-vector space E by that of KR. Let Λ0 be a
lattice in E which is a OK-submodule of E. We consider the canonical surjection

s

π : Λ0 → Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0.

The norm ||.|| on E associated with h,i induces a weight on the quotient space
Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0: if c ∈ Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0,
The quotient Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0 is a vector space of dimension s over the ﬁnite ﬁeld F . We
will call a F -subspace C of Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0 a code. We denote by k its dimension and by

d its minimal weight, with respect to the weight deﬁned above. Finally we denote
by ΛC the lattice obtained from C

wt(c) = min{||z||, π(z) = c}.

and give in the following lemma a summary of its properties:

ΛC = π−1(C)

Lemma 2. Let C be a code of Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0 of dimension k and minimal weight d.

Then :

(i) The volume of ΛC is

Vol(ΛC ) = qs−k Vol(Λ0).

(ii) The minimum of ΛC is µΛC = min{d, µPΛ0}.
(iii) If d 6 µPΛ0 , the packing density of ΛC is:

∆(ΛC) =

Vol(B(d))

2nqs−k Vol(Λ0)

,

where n = sφ(m) is the dimension of E.

Proof.

(i) The lattice π−1(C) contains the lattice PΛ0 and we have:

so

|π−1(C)/PΛ0| = |C| = qk,

Vol(ΛC) =

1
qk Vol(PΛ0) = qs−k Vol(Λ0).

(ii) and (iii) follow directly from the deﬁnitions.

To conclude this subsection, we state a lemma that relates the Euclidean ball

(3)

Vol(B(r))

, we have:

∆(ΛC) >

2nqs−k Vol(Λ0)

.

Proof.

(i) Let c ∈ Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0 such that wt(c) 6 r. We want to prove that c has
exactly one representative x ∈ Λ0 which satisﬁes ||x|| 6 r. Indeed, if y ∈ Λ0
with y 6= x and π(y) = π(x) = c, we have y = x + z with z ∈ PΛ0 \{0}. Then
||x − y|| = ||z|| > µPΛ0 > 2r, a contradiction.

(ii) Let us consider

A = [x∈Λ0∩B(r)

(x + VΛ0 )

where VΛ0 is the Voronoi region of Λ0. The volume of A is
Vol(A) = |Λ0 ∩ B(r)| Vol(Λ0) = |B(r)| Vol(Λ0)

so the wanted inequalities will follow from the inclusions

B(r − τΛ0 ) ⊂ A ⊂ B(r + τΛ0 ).

Let us start with the second inclusion. If z ∈ x + VΛ0 , by deﬁnition of the

covering radius, we have

||z − x|| 6 τΛ0 ,

so if ||x|| 6 r, ||z|| 6 r + τΛ0 . For the ﬁrst inclusion, let y be such that
||y|| 6 r − τΛ0 . If x denotes the closest point to y in Λ0, we have y ∈ x + VΛ0
and ||x|| 6 ||y|| + ||x − y|| 6 r, so that y ∈ A.

(iii) It follows directly from Lemma 2.

3. The density of cyclotomic lattices constructed from codes

In this section, we introduce a certain family of lattices obtained from codes as
described in the previous subsection, and show that for high dimensions, this family
contains lattices having good density.

(cid:3)

Euclidean space E = K 2

As before, K = Q[ζm], F = OK/P ≃ Fq. Let us set s = 2 and consider the
Deﬁnition 1. We denote by C the set of the (q + 1) F -lines of Λ0(cid:14)PΛ0 = F 2, and
by LC the set of lattices of E constructed from the codes in C:

R, of dimension 2φ(m), in which we ﬁx Λ0 = O2
K.

LC = {ΛC, C ∈ C}.

The following lemma evaluates the average of the value of |B(r) ∩ C \ {0}| over

the family C:
Lemma 4. We have:

E(|B(r) ∩ (C \ {0})|) < |B(r)|

Proof. It is a straightforward computation:

E(|B(r) ∩ (C \ {0})|) =

E(|B(r) ∩ (C \ {0})|) = |B(r) \ {0}|

|C|

< |B(r)|

q

.

(cid:3)

From now on, q will vary with m, so we adopt the notation qm instead of q. We
show that the family LC of lattices contains, when m is big enough and when qm
grows in a suitable way with m, lattices having high density.

Theorem 2. For every 1 > ε > 0, if φ(m)2m = o(qm
the family of lattices LC contains a lattice Λ ⊂ R2φ(m) satisfying

Now we can prove Theorem 2.

Proof of Theorem 2. Let us ﬁx 1 > ε > 0. Let rm > 0 be the radius such that
Vol(Brm) = (1 − ε)mqm Vol(Λ0). By (1), rm ∼ ρm, where ρm is the radius deﬁned
in Lemma 5. Applying Lemma 4, we get

E(|B(rm) ∩ (C \ {0})|) < |B(rm)|

qm

.

Because rm ∼ ρm, by (ii) of Lemma 5, rm <
so that

Now applying (i) of Lemma 5, we have lim

= 1, and so, for m

big enough,

(4)

E(|B(rm) ∩ (C \ {0})|) < m.

Now comes the crucial argument involving the action of the m-roots of unity.
From (4), there is at least one code C in C which satisﬁes |B(rm) ∩ (C \ {0})| < m.
Because the codes we consider are stable under the action of the m-roots of unity,
which preserves the weight of the codewords, and because the length of every non
zero orbit under this action is m, we can conclude that B(rm) ∩ (C \ {0}) = ∅, and
so by (iii) of Lemma 3 that,

∆(ΛC ) >

construction provides lattices having density approaching

Theorem 2 shows that for every big enough dimension of the form n = 2φ(m) our

Corollary 1. For inﬁnitely many dimensions, the family LC contains a lattice

Proof. To get the optimal gain between m and 2φ(m), we take m = Yl∈P

X is a positive real number, which tends to inﬁnity. Thanks to Mertens’ theorem
[Har], we can evaluate:

φ(m) ∼ eγ log log m.

where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant which satisﬁes γ > 0.577.

So we get

m ∼ φ(m)eγ log log m ∼

Let us set δ := 2e−γ0.89. Because

eγ

> 0.89, δ < 1. Then by Theorem 2, we

get a lattice Λ ⊂ Rn such that

So by (6), for m big enough,

∆(Λ) >

∆(Λ) >

(cid:3)

Finally we evaluate the complexity of constructing a lattice Λ with the desired

density:

Proposition 1. Let n = 2φ(m). For every 1 > ε > 0, the construction of a lattice
Λ ⊂ Rn satisfying

(1 − ε)m
22φ(m)
requires exp(7.8n log n(1 + o(1)) binary operations.

∆(Λ) >

We need to ﬁnd a prime ideal P such that qm = |OK /P| satisﬁes the condition
required in T heorem 2. Let us recall that qm = pfm
m where pm is the prime number
lying under P, and fm is the order of pm in the group (Z/mZ)∗ (see [Was97]). We
will restrict our attention to the case fm = 1, i.e when pm = 1 mod m. In that
case, pm decomposes totally in Q[ζm], and qm = pm. We use a result of Linnik in
order to give an upper bound for the smallest such prime number:

Lemma 6. There exists an absolute constant C such that for m big enough, there
is a prime number pm congruent to 1 mod m such that φ(m)2m = o(pm
φ(m) ) and:

1

pm 6 C(m3 log m)5.2φ(m).

Proof. Let us set Rm = (m3⌊log m⌋)φ(m). Linnik’s theorem [Lin44] gives an esti-
mate on the ﬁrst prime number in a given arithmetic progression. Applying this
theorem, there exists a prime pm congruent to 1 mod Rm satisfying pm 6 CRL
m for
C and L constants that are independent of m. By a result of Xylouris [Xyl11], we
have L < 5.2. Since m divides Rm, pm is congruent to 1 mod m. Finally because
pm > Rm,

so that φ(m)2m = o(pm

1

φ(m) ).

(cid:3)

Remark 1. A diﬀerent choice of fm leads to the same bound for the size of qm but
introduces technicalities in the proof of Lemma 6. We have taken fm = 1 for the
sake of simplicity.

Proof of Proposition 1. Applying Lemma 6, the complexity of ﬁnding qm satisfying
the condition of Theorem 2 is

O(m3 log m)5.2φ(m) = e15.6φ(m) log(m)(1+o(1)) = e7.8n log(n)(1+o(1)).

The corresponding family of lattices LC has qm + 1 elements. By construction, each
of these lattices is generated by vectors with coeﬃcients which are polynomial in n.
So, the cost of computing their density, which can be done with 2O(n) operations,
following [HPS], is negligible compared with the enumeration of the family.

4. Symplectic cyclotomic lattices

For a survey about symplectic lattices, we refer to [Ber97]. Here we brieﬂy

introduce this notion.

Let E be a Euclidean space, and Λ a lattice in E. Then an isoduality is an
isometry σ of E such that σ(Λ) = Λ#. If Λ aﬀords an isoduality, then it is called
isodual. If moreover σ satisﬁes σ2 = −Id, then Λ is called symplectic.
provides symplectic lattices.

Now we explain how to change the lattice Λ0 in such a way that our construction

Let

Λ0 =

It is clear that σ is an isometry, and that σ2 = −Id.
now symplectic:

In the following lemma, we show that the lattices we deﬁned in Deﬁnition 1 are

Lemma 7. If C is a F -line of Λ0/PΛ0, then the lattice ΛC is symplectic.
Proof. Let us prove that σ(ΛC ) ⊂ Λ#
that for every (y1, y2) ∈ ΛC, hσ(x1, x2), (y1, y2)i ∈ Z, that is
(8)

C . Let us take (x1, x2) ∈ ΛC. We have to show

tr(−x2y1) + tr(x1y2) ∈ Z.

According to the deﬁnition of C, we have C = F (u1, u2) with u1 ∈

To conclude the proof it is enough to notice that Vol(ΛC) = q Vol(Λ0) = 1, which
(cid:3)

implies σ(ΛC ) = Λ#
C .

We again consider the set C of lines of Λ0/PΛ0.

It is clear that the result
of Lemma 4 remains valid for this new family of codes. The general strategy
underlying the proof of Theorem 2 applies to the family of lattices associated to
these codes. However, the growth condition on qm needs to be slightly strengthen
in order to reach the same density as follows:

Theorem 3. For every 1 > ε > 0, if φ(m)2m2 = o(qm
the family of symplectic lattices LC contains a lattice Λ ⊂ R2φ(m) satisfying

φ(m) ), then for m big enough,

1

∆(Λ) >

(1 − ε)m
22φ(m)

.

Corollary 2. For inﬁnitely many dimensions, the family LC contains a symplectic
lattice Λ ⊂ Rn satisfying

∆(Λ) >

0.89n log log n

.

The proofs of Theorem 3 and Corollary 2 are similar to those of Theorem 2 and

Corollary 1, except that Lemma 5 is replaced with:

Lemma 8. Let ρm =r φ(m)

If φ(m)2m2 = o(qm

Proof.

Let us set A1 =

ρm

2φ(m)

which tends to 0 when m goes to inﬁnity, by hypothesis.

(ii) Let us set B1 =

K. Then PΛ0 = B1 × B2, and clearly
µPΛ0 = min{µB1, µB2}. Then, applying (i) of Lemma 1, since Vol(B1) =

1
√q

P and B2 = √q O#

p|dK|q and Vol(B2) =r q

, we have

|dK|
µB1 >pφ(m) q

So

The hypothesis on qm ensures in particular that for m big enough, m satisﬁes

(cid:3)

As the condition on the growth of qm in Lemma 8 is stronger than in Lemma 5,
and this condition plays a role in the estimation of the complexity of construction,
the constant in the exponent of the complexity in Proposition 1 will be slightly
bigger in this context. More precisely, instead of Lemma 6, we will need to apply:

Lemma 9. There exists an absolute constant C such that for m big enough, there
is a prime number pm congruent to 1 mod m such that φ(m)2m2 = o(pm
φ(m) ) and:

1

pm 6 C(m4 log m)5.2φ(m).

Proof. It is the same as the proof of Lemma 6, replacing Rm = (m3⌊log m⌋)φ(m)
with Rm = (m4⌊log m⌋)φ(m).

(cid:3)

Finally, we get an estimation for the complexity of construction in this context:

Proposition 2. Let n = 2φ(m). For every 1 > ε > 0, the construction of a
symplectic lattice Λ ⊂ Rn satisfying

∆(Λ) >

(1 − ε)m
22φ(m)

requires exp(10.4n log n(1 + o(1)) binary operations.
