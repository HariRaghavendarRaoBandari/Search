We study the sequential product GN01,GG02,GG05, the
operation p ∗ q =
p on the set of eﬀects, [0, 1]A ,
of a von Neumann algebra A that represents sequen-
tial measurement of ﬁrst p and then q. InGL08 Gudder
and Lat´emoli`ere give a list of axioms based on physical
grounds that completely determines the sequential prod-
uct on a von Neumann algebra of type I, that is, a von
Neumann algebra B(H ) of all bounded operators on
some Hilbert space H . In this paper we give a list of ax-
ioms that completely determines the sequential product
on all von Neumann algebras simultaneously, see Thm 4.
These axioms may be formulated in purely categori-
cal terms (although we do not pursue this here, see also
Remark 12). In this way this paper contributes to the
larger programJac15,CJWW15b,CJWW15a to identify struc-
ture in the category of von Neumann algebras with com-
pletely positive normal linear contractions to interpret
the constructs in a programming language designed for a
quantum computer: with the sequential product one can
interpret measurement.CJWW15b,CJWW15a

Our axioms for the sequential product are based on the
following observations. Given a von Neumann algebra A
√
and p ∈ [0, 1]A the expression
p makes sense for
pa
all a ∈ A (and not only for a ∈ [0, 1]A ). The resulting
√

map asrtp : A → A (so asrtp(a) =

p) factors as

/ (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101)

where (cid:100)p(cid:101) is the least projection above p.

(Roughly speaking, the von Neumann algebra (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101)
represents the subtype of A in which the predicate p
holds. The map c is simply the restriction of asrtp
to (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101), while π is the map which forgets that p
holds. The map c is a more sharply typed version of se-
quential product than asrtp — much in the same way that
the absolute value on the reals is more sharply described
as a map R → [0,∞) than as a map R → R.)
The maps c and π have a universal property: c is a com-
pression of p and π is a corner of (cid:100)p(cid:101) (see Deﬁnition 2).
Our ﬁrst axiom for the sequential product (p, q) (cid:55)→ p ∗ q
will be that p ∗ (−) = ˜π ◦ ˜c where ˜π is a corner of (cid:100)p(cid:101)
and ˜c is a compression of p. Somewhat to our surprise,
while ˜π and ˜c are unique up to unique isomorphism, the
composition ˜π ◦ ˜c is not uniquely determined. To mend
this problem, we add three more axioms.

Terminology 1. Although we assume the reader is fa-
miliar with the basics of the theory of von Neumann alge-
bras,Sak71 we have included the relevant deﬁnitions and
a selection of useful results in the appendix.

For brevity, a linear map between von Neumann al-
gebras, which is normal, completely positive, and con-
tractive, will be called a process.
(This generalizes
the standard notion of quantum process between ﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert spaces to von Neumann algebras.)
Deﬁnition 2. Let A and C be a von Neumann algebras,
and let p ∈ A with 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 be given.

1. A map ˜c : C → A is a compression of p if ˜c is
a process with ˜c(1) ≤ p, and ˜c is ﬁnal among such
maps in the sense that for every von Neumann alge-
bra B and process f : B → A with f (1) ≤ p there
is a unique process ¯f : B → C such that ˜c ◦ ¯f = f .
2. A map ˜π : A → C is a corner of p if ˜π is a process
with ˜π(p) = ˜π(1), and ˜π is initial among such maps
in the sense that for every von Neumann algebra B
and process g : A → B with g(p) = g(1) there is a
unique process ¯g : C → B with ¯g ◦ ˜π = g.

Deﬁnition 3. An abstract sequential product is
a family of operations ˜∗ : [0, 1]A × [0, 1]A → [0, 1]A ,
where A ranges over all von Neumann algebras, which
obeys the following axioms.
Ax.1 For every von Neumann algebra A and p ∈ [0, 1]A ,
there is a compression ˜c : C → A of p, and corner
˜π : A → C of (cid:100)p(cid:101) such that for all q ∈ [0, 1]A ,

p ˜∗ q = ˜c(˜π(q)).

Ax.2 p ˜∗ (p ˜∗ q) = (p ˜∗ p) ˜∗ q for every von Neumann

algebra A and all p, q ∈ [0, 1]A .

Ax.3 f (p˜∗q) = f (p)˜∗f (q) for every multiplicative process

f : A → B and all p, q ∈ [0, 1]A .

Ax.4 For every von Neumann algebra A and p ∈ [0, 1]A ,

and projections e1, e2 ∈ A ,
p ˜∗ e1 ≤ 1 − e2 ⇐⇒ p ˜∗ e2 ≤ 1 − e1.

Let us formulate the main result of this paper.

Proposition 5. Let A be a von Neumann algebra, and
let p ∈ [0, 1]A . Then π : A → (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99), a (cid:55)→ (cid:98)p(cid:99)a(cid:98)p(cid:99) is
a corner of p.
Proof. Note that (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99) is a von Neumann subalge-
bra of A (with unit (cid:98)p(cid:99)) by Corollary 42. Let us show
that π is a process. To begin, π is normal and com-
pletely positive, because the map A → A , a (cid:55)→ (cid:98)p(cid:99)a(cid:98)p(cid:99)
is normal and completely positive by Lemma 41. Fur-
ther, since (cid:107)(cid:98)p(cid:99)(cid:107) ≤ 1, we have (cid:107)π(a)(cid:107) = (cid:107)(cid:98)p(cid:99)a(cid:98)p(cid:99)(cid:107) ≤
(cid:107)(cid:98)p(cid:99)(cid:107)2(cid:107)a(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)a(cid:107), for all a ∈ A , and so π is contractive.
Hence π is a process. Further, π(1) = (cid:98)p(cid:99) = (cid:98)p(cid:99)p(cid:98)p(cid:99) =
π(p) by Proposition 43.

To prove that π is a corner of p it remains to be
shown that π is initial in the sense that for every pro-
cess g : A → B with g(p) = g(1) there is a unique pro-
cess ¯g : (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99) → B with ¯g ◦ π = g.
(Uniqueness) Let ¯g1, ¯g2 : (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99) → B be processes
with ¯g1 ◦ π = g = ¯g2 ◦ π. We must show that ¯g1 = ¯g2.
Let a ∈ (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99) be given. Then a = (cid:98)p(cid:99)a(cid:98)p(cid:99) = π(a),
and so ¯g1(a) = ¯g1(π(a)) = g(a). Similarly ¯g2(a) = g(a),
and so ¯g1(a) = ¯g2(a). Hence ¯g1 = ¯g2.
(Existence) To begin, we will prove that g(1−(cid:98)p(cid:99)) = 0.
Since 1 − (cid:98)p(cid:99) = (cid:100)1 − p(cid:101) is the supremum of 1 − p ≤
(1 − p)1/2 ≤ (1 − p)1/4 ≤ ··· (see Proposition 43) and g is
normal, it suﬃces to show that
g( (1 − p)1/2n ) = 0

(1)
Note that g(1− p) = 0, so to prove (1) it suﬃces to show
that g(a) = 0 entails g(a1/2) = 0 for all a ∈ A with
a ≥ 0. Since g is 2-positive, we have (by Theorem 54),
for all b, c ∈ A ,

for all n ∈ N.

(cid:107)g(b∗c)(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)g(b∗b)(cid:107)(cid:107)g(c∗c)(cid:107).

(2)

In particular, for a ∈ A+, we have

(cid:107)g(a1/2)(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)g(1)(cid:107)(cid:107)g(a)(cid:107).

So g(a) = 0 entails (cid:107)g(a1/2)(cid:107)2 = 0, and g(a1/2) = 0.
Thus g(1 − (cid:98)p(cid:99)) = 0.
Recall that (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99) is a von Neumann subalgebra
of A . Let j : (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99) → A be the inclusion. Then j is a
normal contractive ∗-homomorphism, and thus a process.
Deﬁne ¯g := g ◦ j : (cid:98)p(cid:99)A (cid:98)p(cid:99) → B. Then ¯g is a process.
To complete the proof, we must show that ¯g◦ π = g, that
is, g((cid:98)p(cid:99)a(cid:98)p(cid:99)) = g(a) for all a ∈ A .
Let a ∈ A be given. We show that g((cid:98)p(cid:99)a) = g(a). By
the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for 2-positive maps (see
Statement (2)), we have,

(cid:107)g((1 − (cid:98)p(cid:99))a)(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)g(1 − (cid:98)p(cid:99))(cid:107)(cid:107)g(a∗a)(cid:107).

Since g(1−(cid:98)p(cid:99)) = 0, we have (cid:107)g((1−(cid:98)p(cid:99))a)(cid:107)2 ≤ 0, and so
0 = g((1−(cid:98)p(cid:99))a) = g(a)− g((cid:98)p(cid:99)a). Thus g(a) = g((cid:98)p(cid:99)a).
g(a) = g(a(cid:98)p(cid:99)) and so g(π(a)) =
g((cid:98)p(cid:99)a(cid:98)p(cid:99)) = g((cid:98)p(cid:99)a) = g(a) for all a ∈ A .

Similarly,

Hence π is a corner for p.

Proposition 6. Let A be a von Neumann algebra, and
let p ∈ [0, 1]A . Then c : (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) → A , a (cid:55)→ √
p is

a compression of p.
Proof. Note that (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) is a von Neumann subalgebra
of A with unit (cid:100)p(cid:101) (see Corollary 42). Since therefore
the inclusion (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) → A is a process, and the map
a (cid:55)→ √
p : A (cid:55)→ A is a process (see Lemma 41), it
follows that c is a process. Further, note that c(1) = p ≤
p.

To prove that c is a compression it remains to be shown
that c is ﬁnal in the sense that for every von Neumann
algebra B and process f : B → A with f (1) ≤ p there
is a unique ¯f : B → (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) such that f = c ◦ ¯f .

deﬁned in a similar manner. However, p might not be
pseudoinvertible.Nota Therefore, we will instead approxi-
mate the (possibly non-existent) pseudoinverse of

an approximate identity in a C∗-algebra approximates a

By the Spectral Theorem (see Thm. 38 and Thm. 36),
we may assume without loss of generality that A
is a von Neumann subalgebra of the bounded opera-
tors B(L2(X)) on the Hilbert space L2(X) of square-
integrable functionsNotb on some measure space X, and
that there is a real bounded integrable function ˆp on X
such that, for all f ∈ L2(X),

and (ˆp) = p.
ˆp might not be pseudoinvertible in L∞(X),

1Qn has ˆq · 1Qn as pseudoinverse in L∞(X), where

Let b ∈ B be given. We want to deﬁne ¯f (b) by
Equation (3), but for this, we must ﬁrst show that
(qn f (b) qn)n converges ultraweakly.
It suﬃces to show
that (qn f (b) qn)n is norm bounded, and ultraweakly
Cauchy (see Proposition 40).
We only need to consider the case that b ∈ [0, 1]B.
Indeed, any b ∈ B can written as

b ≡ (cid:107)b(cid:107) (b1 − b2 + ib3 − ib4),

Let n ∈ N be given.

(4)
where bi ∈ [0, 1]B, and if (qn f (bi) qn)n converges ultra-
weakly for each i, then so does (qn f (b) qn)n.
Since f (b) ≤ f (1) ≤ p,
we have qn f (b) qn ≤ qn p qn. Since qn = (ˆq · 1Qn ),
ˆp · 1Qn ,
p = (ˆp), and ˆq · 1Qn is the pseudoinverse of
we get qn p qn = (1Qn ) ≤ 1, and so qn f (b) qn ≤ 1.
Hence (cid:107)qn f (b) qn(cid:107) ≤ 1, and so (qn f (b) qn)n is norm
bounded.

Let ϕ : A → C be a normal state.

To prove
that (qn f (b) qn)n is ultraweakly Cauchy, we must show
that (ϕ(qn f (b) qn))n is Cauchy.

Note that Sn,1 = Qn and sn,1 = qn. (We have not de-
ﬁned s∞,m = (ˆq · 1S∞,m ), because ˆq · 1S∞,m might not

(5)

Let 0 < m < n be given. Since (1/n, 1] is the disjoint
union of (1/n, 1/m] and (1/m, 1], Qn is the disjoint union
of Sn,m and Qm, and qn = sn,m + qm, and
qn f (b) qn − qm f (b) qm

= sn,m f (b) sn,m + sn,m f (b) qm + qm f (b) sn,m.

Thus,

| ϕ( qn f (b) qn − qm f (b) qm )|

≤ |ϕ(sn,m f (b) sn,m)| + |ϕ(sn,m f (b) qm)|

(6)

+ |ϕ(qm f (b) sn,m)|

Note that for k < (cid:96) and m < n, we have
|ϕ(s(cid:96),kf (b)sn,m)|2

since f (b) ≤ p

as Sn,m ⊆ S∞,m

m(0, 1/m] = ∅,
m S∞,m = ∅. Then
inf m 1S∞,m = 0, and so inf m ϕ((1S∞,m )) = 0, because 
and ϕ are normal. Thus ( ϕ((1S∞,m)) )m converges to 0,
Let ε > 0 be given. There is N ∈ N such that for

m > N , we have, by Equation (7),

|ϕ( qn f (b) qn − qm f (b) qm )| ≤ ε.

(8)

Hence (qnf (b)qn)n is ultraweakly Cauchy and norm
bounded, and must therefore converge ultraweakly. We
may now (and do) deﬁne f (b) as in Equation (3).
Thus, (qnf (−)qn)n converges coordinatewise ultra-
weakly to f . Note that the number N related to In-
equality (8) depends on ε and ϕ, but does not depend
on b. It follows that on [0, 1]B the sequence (qnf (−)qn)n
converges uniformly ultraweakly to f .

It is easy to see that f is linear and positive. It remains
to be shown that f is contractive, normal, completely
positive, c ◦ f = f , and f (B) ⊆ (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101).
(f (B) ⊆ (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101)) Let b ∈ B be given. We must show
that f (b) ∈ (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101). By writing b as in Equation (4),
the problem is easily reduced to the case that b ∈ [0, 1]B.
Let n ∈ N be given. Since b ≤ 1, we have f (b) ≤

so f (b) = uwlimn qnf (b)qn ≤ (cid:100)p(cid:101). Corollary 28, gives
us (cid:100)p(cid:101)f (b)(cid:100)p(cid:101) = f (b), and so f (b) ∈ (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101).
(f is contractive) It suﬃces to show that f (1) ≤ 1.
Let n ∈ N be given. Since f (1) ≤ p, we have

Since ˆp−1((0, 1]) = S∞,1, and it

III. EXISTENCE

To show that the sequential product is an abstract se-
quential product, we use the following result, which (we
think) is interesting in itself.

Lemma 7. Let a be an element of a von Neumann alge-
bra (or a unital C∗-algebra) A with a∗a ≤ 1. Then for
projections e1, e2 ∈ A the following are equivalent.

1. a∗e1a ≤ 1 − e2
2. ae2a∗ ≤ 1 − e1

3. e1ae2 = 0
4. e2a∗e1 = 0

Proof. (1 =⇒ 3) We must show that e1ae2 = 0. It suﬃces
to show e2a∗e1ae2 = 0, because (cid:107)e1ae2(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)e2a∗e1ae2(cid:107)

4
by the C∗-identity. Since 0 ≤ a∗e1a ≤ 1 − e2, we have
0 ≤ e2a∗e1ae2 ≤ e2(1 − e2)e2 = 0, and so e2a∗e1ae2 = 0.
(3 =⇒ 1) Since e1ae2 = 0, also e1a = e1a(1 − e2), and
a∗e1 = (1−e2)a∗e1. Then a∗e1a = (1−e2)a∗e1a(1−e2) ≤
1 − e2, because a∗e1a ≤ a∗a ≤ 1.
(4 ⇐⇒ 2) follows by the same reasoning as 1 ⇐⇒ 3.
(3 ⇐⇒ 4) follows by applying (−)∗.

sition 5, and c : (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) → A is the compression of p
from Proposition 6. Thus ∗ obeys Ax.1.

The proof of (Ax.2) and (Ax.3) is easy, and (Ax.4)

follows from Lemma 7.

IV. UNIQUENESS

We will need the following fact later on.

Lemma 9. Let f, g : V → W be linear maps between
complex vector spaces. Assume that for every v ∈ V ,
there is an α ∈ C\{0} with f (v) = α · g(v).
Then there is α0 ∈ C\{0} with f = α0 · g.

Proof. For the moment, assume f and g are injective.
If V = {0}, then α0 ≡ 1 works, so assume V (cid:54)= {0}.
Pick any v ∈ V with v (cid:54)= 0. Let α0 ∈ C\{0} be such
that f (v) = α0 · g(v). Let w ∈ V . We have to show that
f (w) = α0 · g(w). Now, either g(v) and g(w) are linearly
dependent or not.
Suppose that g(v) and g(w) are linearly independent.
Let β ∈ C\{0} be such that f (w) = β · g(w), and let γ ∈
C\{0} be such that f (v + w) = γ · g(v + w). Then

(γ − α0) · g(v) + (γ − β) · g(w) = 0.

By linear independence, we have γ − α0 = 0 = γ − β.
Hence α0 = β, and so f (w) = α0 · g(w).
Suppose that g(v) and g(w) are linearly dependent.
As v (cid:54)= 0 and g is injective, we have g(v)
(cid:54)= 0.
Thus g(w) = ·g(v) for some  ∈ C. Then g(w−·v) = 0,
and so w =  · v, since g is injective. We have

f (w) =  · f (v) =  · α0 · g(v) = α0 · g(w).

Thus we have f (w) = α0g(w) whether g(v) and g(w)

are linearly dependent or not.

We now return to the general case in which f and g
might not be injective. Note that the kernels of f and g
coincide, and so, writing N ≡ ker f = ker g, there are
unique t, s : V /N → W such that s ◦ q = f and t ◦ q = g,
where q : V → V /N is the quotient map. Clearly, s and t
are injective, and for every v ∈ V /N there is α ∈ C\{0}
with s(v) = α · t(v). Thus, by the previous discussion,
there is α0 ∈ C\{0} with s = α0 · t. Then f = α0 · g.

Proposition 10. For any abstract sequential product, ˜∗,
√
we have p ˜∗ q =
p, where p, q ∈ [0, 1]A and A is a
von Neumann algebra.
Proof. Let A be a von Neumann algebra, and p ∈ [0, 1]A .
By Ax.1 there is a corner ˜π of (cid:100)p(cid:101) and a compression ˜c
of p such that p ˜∗ q = ˜c(˜π(q)) for all q ∈ [0, 1]A .
Let c : (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) → A be the compression of p given
p for all a ∈ (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) (see Proposition 6).
by c(a) =
Since both c and ˜c are compressions of p it is easy to see
that there is an invertible process ϑ such that ˜c = c ◦ ϑ.
In fact, ϑ is a ∗-isomorphism by Corollary 47.
Similarly, ˜π = χ ◦ π where χ is some ∗-isomorphism χ,
and π : A → (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101) is the corner of (cid:100)p(cid:101) given
by π(a) = (cid:100)p(cid:101)a(cid:100)p(cid:101) for all a ∈ A (see Proposition 5).
p for all q ∈ [0, 1]A ,
where ψ = ϑ ◦ χ is a ∗-automorphism of (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101).

Roughly speaking, our goal

is to prove ψ = id.
We will ﬁrst consider the case that A = B(H ).
Since (cid:100)p(cid:101)B(H )(cid:100)p(cid:101) is a type I factor (i.e. ∗-isomorphic
to B(K ) for some Hilbert space K ), it is knownKap52
that ψ must be an inner ∗-automorphism, that is, there
is a unitary u ∈ (cid:100)p(cid:101)B(H )(cid:100)p(cid:101) such that ψ(a) = u∗au
for all a ∈ (cid:100)p(cid:101)B(H )(cid:100)p(cid:101). Note that (cid:100)p(cid:101)u = u since u ∈
(cid:100)p(cid:101)B(H )(cid:100)p(cid:101). Thus we have, for all b ∈ [0, 1]B(H ),

We aim to show that u = 1, or at least that u = α1 for
some α ∈ C with |α| = 1.

Our ﬁrst step is to prove that up = pu. To this end, we
extract some information about u from Ax.4. First, note
that for vectors v, w ∈ H with (cid:107)w(cid:107) = 1 and (cid:107)v(cid:107) ≤ 1,
|v(cid:105)(cid:104)v| ≤ 1−|w(cid:105)(cid:104)w|

For all v, w ∈ H with (cid:107)v(cid:107) = (cid:107)w(cid:107) = 1, the following are

REMARKS

Remark 11. Gudder and Lat´emoli`ere (G&L) showed
inGL08 that the sequential product on the eﬀects of a
Hilbert space H is the only binary operation ˜∗ that sat-
isﬁes the following axioms. For all a, b ∈ [0, 1]B(H ), and
every density operator  on H ,
GL1. tr[(a ˜∗ )b] = tr[(a ˜∗ b)];
GL2. a ˜∗ 1 = 1 ˜∗ a = a;
GL3. a ˜∗ (a ˜∗ b) = (a ˜∗ a) ˜∗ b = a2 ˜∗ b, and
GL4. a (cid:55)→ a ˜∗ b is strongly continuous.
Let us compare their proof of uniqueness with our proof
of uniqueness of the abstract sequential product. The
broad strokes are similar: in both proofs it is shown

1. ﬁrst that p ˜∗ q =

p for appropriate u;

and Ax.2 respectively.

√

pq

However, the short strokes are quite diﬀerent. For in-
stance, while GL3 and Ax.2 clearly serve the same pur-
pose in both proofs (enabling the third step mentioned
above), the relation between GL1 and its analogue, Ax.4,
is less clear: Ax.4 only comes into play at the second
step, while GL1 is important in both the ﬁrst and second
steps. Also, the proof of G&L has a branch in the ﬁrst
step (case iii on page 9 ofGL08), which has no companion
in our proof.
Remark 12. The universal properties of the compres-
sion c (from Proposition 6) and of the corner π (from
Proposition 5) may be cast into the following chain of
adjunctions.

Here, vN is the category of von Neumann algebras and
processes, and (cid:3) is the functor vNop → Posetop given

by (cid:3)(A ) = [0, 1]A and (cid:3)(f )(p) = f (p⊥)⊥, and (cid:82) (cid:3)

is its Grothendieck completion. Such chains appear in
several other categories and provide a tool to study the
sequential product in other settings (seeCJWW15b).
Remark 13. We have shown that Ax.1, Ax.2, Ax.3, Ax.4
axiomatize the sequential product. A natural question is
whether three of them would have suﬃced. We will show
that Ax.1, Ax.2, and Ax.4 cannot be dropped. We do
not know whether Ax.3 is redundant.

(Of course, instead of being dropped, the axioms may
also be weakened. For example, Ax.3 is used only with f
a representation, and Ax.4 is only used with e1, e2 rank
one projections.)
Ax.1 The operation ˜∗ given by p ˜∗ q ≡ pqp satisﬁes Ax.2,

Ax.3, and Ax.4, but not Ax.1.

Ax.2 Observe that if we pick for every eﬀect p on a von
Neumann algebra A a unitary up from (cid:100)p(cid:101)A (cid:100)p(cid:101),
then we may form an operation ˜∗ on all eﬀects by
p ˜∗ q ≡ √

p, which satisﬁes Ax.1.

Further, note that if u2

every up is self-adjoint, then ˜∗ satisﬁes Ax.4.
Deﬁne up by up = g(p), where g : [0, 1] → {−1, 1} is
any Borel function with g(2/3) = 1 and g(4/9) = −1.

Appendix A: C∗-algebras

Terminology 15.

1. A C∗-algebra A is a complete
normed complex vector space endowed with a bi-
linear associative product and an antilinear map
(−)∗ : A → A such that a∗∗ = a, (ab)∗ = b∗a∗,
(cid:107)ab(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)a(cid:107)(cid:107)b(cid:107), and(cid:107)a∗a(cid:107) = (cid:107)a(cid:107)2 for all a, b ∈ A .
(The last equation is called the C∗-identity.)

2. An element a of a C∗-algebra A is called
(a) positive if a ≡ b∗b for some b ∈ A ;
(b) self-adjoint if a∗ = a;
(c) a projection if a∗a = a;
(d) central if ab = ba for all b ∈ A ;
(e) a unit if ab = ba = b for all b ∈ A .
The set of positive elements of A is denoted by A+,
and the set of self-adjoint elements of A by Asa.
3. A C∗-algebra is partially ordered by as follows. For

all a, b ∈ A , we have a ≤ b iﬀ b − a is positive.

4. A C∗-algebra A is

(a) unital if A contains a unit, 1;
(b) commutative if ab = ba for all a, b ∈ A ;
(c) a factor if S is unital and all its central ele-

ments are of the form λ · 1 where λ ∈ C.

5. Let A and B be C∗-algebras. A linear map

f : A → B is called
(a) bounded if (cid:107)f(cid:107) < ∞, where

(cid:107)f(cid:107) = sup{ λ ∈ [0,∞) : ∀a ∈ A [ (cid:107)f (a)(cid:107) ≤ λ(cid:107)a(cid:107) ]}.

(b) contractive if (cid:107)f(cid:107) ≤ 1;
(c) a ∗-homomorphism if f (ab) = f (a)f (b) and

f (a∗) = f (a)∗ for all a, b ∈ A ;

homomorphism;

(d) a ∗-isomorphism if f is a bijective ∗-
(e) positive if f (a) ∈ B+ for all a ∈ A+;
(f) unital if A and B are unital, and f (1) = 1;
(g) normal if for every directed subset D of self-
if D has a supre-

mum (cid:87) D in Asa, then f ((cid:87) D) is the supre-

adjoint elements of A :
mum of {f (d) : d ∈ D} in Bsa;

7

(h) a process if f is normal, completely positive

and contractive.

6. Let A be a unital C∗-algebra. A state of A is a

positive unital linear map ϕ : A → C.

7. A C∗-subalgebra of a C∗-algebra A is a norm
closed linear subspace S of A such that ab ∈ S
and a∗ ∈ S for all a, b ∈ S . (Such a set S is itself
a C∗-algebra in the obvious way.)

8. For every positive element a of a C∗-algebra A
there is a unique positive b ∈ A with a = b2 and
ba = ab. We write

√
a = b.

Example 16. Let X be a compact Hausdorﬀ space. The
commutative unital C∗-algebra of continuous functions
on X is the set C(X) of continuous complex-valued func-
tions on X endowed with the supremum norm and coor-
dinatewise operations.

Theorem 17 (Gel’fand–Neumark). Every commutative
unital C∗-algebra is ∗-isomorphic to a C∗-algebra of con-
tinuous functions on a compact Hausdorﬀ space.

Proof. Apply Theorem 2.1 ofCon90.

Example 18. Let H be a Hilbert space. The bounded
operators on H form a unital C∗-algebra, B(H ), in
which the product is given by composition, (−)∗ is the
adjoint, and the norm is the operator norm. Moreover,
B(H ) is a factor (of “type I”), and A ∈ B(H ) is posi-
tive iﬀ 0 ≤ (cid:104)x, Ax(cid:105) for all x ∈ H .
A C∗-algebra of bounded operators on H is a C∗-
subalgebra B(H ) of bounded operators on H (but need
not be a factor).

Theorem 19 (Gel’fand–Neumark–Segal). Every unital
C∗-algebra is ∗-isomorphic to a C∗-algebra of bounded
operators on a Hilbert space.

Proof. Unfold Theorem 5.17 ofCon90.

The norm determines the order:

Lemma 20. Let A be a unital C∗-algebra, and a ∈ Asa.
Then a ≥ 0 iﬀ (cid:107)(cid:107)a(cid:107) − a(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)a(cid:107).

have (cid:107)f (a)(cid:107) = (cid:107)a(cid:107), and f (a) ≥ 0 iﬀ a ≥ 0.

Then f is contractive, and f (A ) is norm closed and
Moreover, if f is injective, then, for all a ∈ A , we

Proof. Use Theorem VIII/4.8 ofCon90 and Lem. 20.

If we apply the proposition above to the inclusion of a
C∗-subalgebra, then we get the following desirable result.

Corollary 22. Let A be a unital C∗-algebra, and let a
be an element of a unital C∗-subalgebra B of A .
Then (cid:107)a(cid:107)A = (cid:107)a(cid:107)B, and a ∈ A+ iﬀ a ∈ B+.

The order also determines the norm:

Corollary 23. Let A be a unital C∗-algebra. Then

(cid:107)a(cid:107) = min{ λ ∈ [0,∞) : − λ ≤ a ≤ λ}

(A1)

for any self-adjoint element a of A .

Proof. Note that if A = C(X) for some compact Haus-
dorﬀ space, then (A1) is evidently correct, because the
norm on C(X) is the supnorm. Thus, (A1) is also correct
if A is commutative, since in that case A is ∗-isomorphic
to some C(X) by Theorem 17.
In general, however, A need not be commutative, but
the C∗-subalgebra, C∗(a), generated by a is commuta-
tive. Thus, since the order and the norm on C∗(a) agree
with the order and norm on A by Corollary 22, (A1)
holds on A (because it holds on C∗(a)).

Lemma 27. Let a be an element and p a projection in
a unital C∗-algebra A . If a∗a ≤ p, then ap = a.

Proof. Follows from Lemma 7.

Corollary 28. Let A be a unital C∗-algebra. For every
projection p in A and a ∈ A with 0 ≤ a ≤ p, we have
ap = pa = a.
Corollary 29. Let p, q be projections with p + q ≤ 1 in
a unital C∗-algebra. Then pq = qp = 0.
Lemma 30. For an element p of a unital C∗-algebra A ,
the following are equivalent.

1. p is a projection.
2. a ≤ p and a ≤ 1 − p entails a = 0 for all a ∈ A+.

8
Proof. (1=⇒2) Let a ∈ A+ with a ≤ p and a ≤ 1 − p be
given. Since ap = a and a(1 − p) = a by Corollary 28,
we get a = ap + a(1 − p) = 2a, and so a = 0.
(2=⇒1) We may assume that A is commutative (by
considering the C∗-subalgebra generated by {a} instead),
and so A ∼= C(X) for some compact Hausdorﬀ space by
Theorem 17.
Then a ∈ C(X) given by a(x) = min{p(x), 1−p(x)} for
all x ∈ X is positive and below both p and 1−p. Thus a =
0 by assumption. Then, for all x ∈ X, either p(x) = 0
or 1 − p(x) = 0. Thus p takes only the values 0 and 1,
and is therefore easily seen to be a projection.
Corollary 31. Let f : A → B be an invertible posi-
tive unital linear map between unital C∗-algebras, such
that f−1 is positive. Then f preserves projections.

Terminology 32. A von Neumann algebra is a unital
C∗-algebra A such that: (I) every bounded directed set
of self-adjoint elements of A has a supremum in Asa,
and (II) for every positive a ∈ A : if ϕ(a) = 0 for every
normal state ϕ of A , then a = 0.Kad56
A von Neumann subalgebra of a von Neumann al-
gebra A is a C∗-subalgebra S of A such that for every

bounded directed set D of Ssa we have(cid:87) D ∈ S , where
(cid:87) D is the supremum of D in Asa.

Theorem 35 (Kadison). For a C∗-algebra of bounded
operators on a Hilbert space, the following are equivalent.

1. A is a von Neumann subalgebra of B(H );

2. A is weakly closed in B(H ).

Proof. This follows from Lemma 1 ofKad56.

Theorem 36 (Kadison). Any von Neumann algebra is
∗-isomorphic to a von Neumann subalgebra of B(H ) for
some Hilbert space H .

Moreover, H can be chosen in such a way that the ul-
traweak topology on A coincides with weak topology on A
induced by B(H )

Proof. That A is ∗-isomorphic to a von Neumann al-
gebra of bounded operators on some Hilbert space H
follows from Theorem 1 ofKad56. That the ultraweak
topology on A coincides with the weak topology on A
induced by H follows from the way the Hilbert space H
is constructed in the ﬁrst paragraph of the proof of The-
orem 1Kad56 (if we take (ωα)α∈Γ to be the collection of
all normal states): for every normal state ω of A there
is x ∈ H with ω(a) = (cid:104)x, ax(cid:105) for all a ∈ A .

strongly to (cid:87) D (see Lemma 5.1.4 ofKR97) we see that
(bd)d∈D converges weakly to b((cid:87) D). Since bd = db for
all d ∈ D, and (db)d∈D converges weakly to ((cid:87) D)b by a
similar reasoning, we get ((cid:87) D)b = b((cid:87) D).

Proof. We may assume (by Theorem 36) without loss of
generality that A is a von Neumann subalgebra of B(H )
for some Hilbert space H .
Since (d)d∈D converges

Proposition 40. Let (ai)i be a net in a von Neumann
algebra A such that

1. (ai)i is norm bounded, that is supi (cid:107)ai(cid:107) < ∞, and
2. (ai)i is ultraweakly Cauchy, that is, (ϕ(ai))i is

Cauchy for every normal state ϕ : A → C.

Then (ai)i converges ultraweakly.

Proof. By Theorem 36, we may assume without loss of
generality that A is a von Neumann algebra of bounded
operators on some Hilbert space H such that the weak
topology on A induced by H coincides with the ultra-
weak topology.
Let x ∈ H be given. Note that if (cid:107)x(cid:107) = 1, then
(cid:104)x,− x(cid:105) : A → C is a normal state, and so ((cid:104)x, aix(cid:105))i is
It follows easily that ((cid:104)x, aix(cid:105))i is Cauchy for

all x ∈ H .

Let x, y ∈ H be given. Since for all a ∈ A ,

|(cid:104)x, ay(cid:105)|2 ≤ (cid:104)x, ax(cid:105) (cid:104)y, ay(cid:105) ,

we see that ((cid:104)x, aiy(cid:105))i is Cauchy.

Since (x, y) (cid:55)→ limi (cid:104)x, aiy(cid:105) gives a bilinear map on H ,
which is bounded because (ai)i is norm bounded, there is,
by Riesz’s representation theorem, a bounded operator a
on H with (cid:104)ax, y(cid:105) = limi (cid:104)aix, y(cid:105) for all x, y ∈ H .
Note that (ai)i converges weakly to a. Thus a ∈ A ,
because A is weakly closed by Theorem 35. Further,
(ai)i converges ultraweakly to a as well, because the weak
and ultraweak topologies coincide on A by choice of H .

Lemma 41. Let a be an element of a von Neumann
algebra A . Then the linear map c : A → A , b (cid:55)→ a∗ba
is normal and completely positive.

Proof. (Normality) follows from Lemma 1.7.4 ofSak71.
(Complete positivity) follows from Theorem 1 ofSti55, but
let us give an elementary proof.
Let N ∈ N be given. Let B be a positive N ×N -matrix
over A . We must show that (a∗Bija)ij is a positive N ×
N -matrix over A . Since B is positive, there is a N × N -
matrix C with B = C∗C. Note that
(a∗Bija)ij = A∗BA ≡ A∗C∗CA = (CA)∗CA ≥ 0,
where A = (a)ij is a diagonal N × N -matrix. Thus c is
completely positive.

Corollary 42. For every projection p of a von Neumann
algebra A , pA p is a von Neumann subalgebra of A .
Proof. Surely, pA p is a ∗-subalgebra of A with unit p.
Since (cid:107)pap−pbp(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)p(cid:107)(cid:107)a−b(cid:107)(cid:107)p(cid:107) for all a, b ∈ A , we see
that pA p is norm closed, and pA p is a C∗-subalgebra.
Let D be a bounded directed subset of (pA p)sa. To
prove that pA p is a von Neumann subalgebra, it suﬃces
Since a (cid:55)→ pap is normal on A by Lemma 41, and

we have d = pdp for all d ∈ D, we see that p((cid:87) D)p =
(cid:87)
d∈D pdp =(cid:87) D, and so(cid:87) D ∈ A .

Proposition 43. Let A be a von Neumann algebra.
Let a ∈ A with 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 be given.

1. There is a smallest projection, (cid:100)a(cid:101), above a.
2. (cid:100)a(cid:101) is the supremum of a ≤ a1/2 ≤ a1/4 ≤ a1/8 ≤ ··· .
3. Then ab = ba implies (cid:100)a(cid:101)b = b(cid:100)a(cid:101) for all b ∈ B.

Proof. Let p be the supremum of a, a1/2, a1/4, . . . in Asa.
Let q be a projection in A with a ≤ q. Then aq = qa = a
by Corollary 28, and so a1/2q = qa1/2 by Corollary 25.
Since a(1 − q) = 0, we have

a. Then

a =

(cid:107)√
a(1 − q)(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)(1 − q)a(1 − q)(cid:107) = 0

aq =
aq ≤ q. With a similar

reasoning, we get a1/4 ≤ q, and a1/8 ≤ q, and so on. It
follows that p ≤ q, by deﬁnition of p.
Thus, to show that p is the least projection above a, we
only need to show that p is a projection. Since 0 ≤ p ≤ 1
(and thus p2 ≤ p) it suﬃces to show that p ≤ p2.
First note that any b ∈ A that commutes with a, com-
mutes with a1/2, and with a1/4, etc., and thus b commutes
with p by Proposition 39.

In particular, since each a1/2n commutes with a, we see

that a1/2n commutes with p. Then, by Lemma 41,

Thus p2 ≥ a1/2k for every k ∈ N, and so p2 ≥ p.

Hence p is a projection.

Proposition 44. Let f : A → B be a positive linear
contraction between von Neumann algebras. Let a ∈ A .

10

Proof. (1 =⇒ 2) Easy.
(2 =⇒ 3) Let a ∈ [0, 1]A be given. By Proposition 44
we have (cid:100)f (a)(cid:101) = (cid:100)f ((cid:100)a(cid:101))(cid:101) = f ((cid:100)a(cid:101)), where the latter
equality follows from the fact that f ((cid:100)a(cid:101)) is a projection.
(3 =⇒ 1) Let a, b ∈ A+ with ab = 0 be given. To
prove that f is multiplicative, it suﬃces to show that
f (a)f (b) = 0 by Theorem 45 (since f (1) = 1).
If either a or b is zero, we are done, so we may assume
that a (cid:54)= 0 and b (cid:54)= 0. We may also assume that a, b ≤ 1
(by replacing them by a/(cid:107)a(cid:107) and b/(cid:107)b(cid:107) if necessary).
It suﬃces to show that (cid:100)f (a)(cid:101)(cid:100)f (b)(cid:101) = 0, because then
f (a)f (b) = f (a)(cid:100)f (a)(cid:101)(cid:100)f (b)(cid:101)f (b) = 0, where we used
that f (a) = f (a)(cid:100)f (a)(cid:101) (see Proposition 43).
Note that a and b commute, because ba = b∗a∗ =
(ab)∗ = 0 = ab. Then

b commute as well, and
a(cid:101) =

0, and so a(cid:100)b(cid:101) = 0. By repeating this argument, we see
that (cid:100)a(cid:101)(cid:100)b(cid:101) = 0.

√
a = ab = 0. Then 0 ≤ √

a ≤ (cid:100)√

It follows that (cid:100)a(cid:101) + (cid:100)b(cid:101) is a projection, and
(cid:100)f (a)(cid:101) + (cid:100)f (b)(cid:101) = f ((cid:100)a(cid:101)) + f ((cid:100)b(cid:101)) ≤ f (1) = 1.

Thus Corollary 29 implies that (cid:100)f (a)(cid:101)(cid:100)f (b)(cid:101) = 0.

Corollary 47. Let f be an invertible process between
von Neumann algebras such that f−1 is a process as well.
Then f is a ∗-isomorphism.
Proof. Since f (1) ≤ 1 = f (f−1(1)) we have 1 ≤ f−1(1) ≤
1, and so f−1(1) = 1. Thus both f and f−1 are unital.
Then f preserves projections by Corollary 31, and is thus
a ∗-homomorphism by Proposition 46.

Hence f is a ∗-isomorphism.

Appendix C: Ultraweak limits of maps

Lemma 48. For a positive linear map f : A → B be-
tween von Neumann algebras the following are equivalent.

1. f is normal.

2. f is ultraweakly continuous.
3. The restriction of f to a map [0, 1]A → B is ultra-

weakly continuous.

Proof. (1 =⇒2) Let ϕ : B → C be a normal state. To
prove that f is ultraweakly continuous we must show that
ϕ ◦ f : A → C is continuous with respect to the ultra-
weak topology on A and the standard topology on C. It
suﬃces to show that ϕ ◦ f is normal, which indeed it is,
as both ϕ and f are normal.

d∈D f (d). Since f is linear, we may assume without

normal state. It suﬃces to show that

and thus in [0, 1]A as well. Since the restriction of f
to [0, 1]A is ultraweakly continuous, the net (f (d))d∈D

Note that D (as net) converges ultraweakly to(cid:87) D in A ,
converges ultraweakly to f ((cid:87) D ) in B. So (ϕ(f (d)))d∈D
converges to ϕ(f ((cid:87) D)). Since (ϕ(f (d)))d∈D is directed,
ϕ(f ((cid:87) D)) is in fact its supremum. Finally, since ϕ is
normal, ϕ((cid:87)
d∈D ϕ(f (d)) = ϕ(f ((cid:87) D )).

d∈D f (d) ) = (cid:87)

We have proven Statement (C1), so f is normal.
Corollary 49. Let f : A → B be a positive linear map
between von Neumann algebras. Let (fα)α∈D be a net
of normal positive linear maps from A to B which con-
verges uniformly on [0, 1]A ultraweakly to f .

Then f is normal.

Proof. The uniform limit of continuous functions is con-
tinuous.
In particular, since the fα (being normal
and hence ultraweakly continuous) converge uniformly
on [0, 1]A to f , we see that the restriction of f to [0, 1]A
is ultraweakly continuous, and thus f is normal by
Lemma 48.
Lemma 50. Let B be a C∗-algebra of operators on a
Hilbert space H . Let A be a C∗-algebra. Let (fα)α∈D
be a net of completely positive linear maps from A
to B which converges pointwise weakly to a linear
map f : A → B. Then f is completely positive.
Proof. Let A be a positive N × N -matrix over A for
some N ∈ N. We must show that (f (Aij))ij is a pos-
itive N × N -matrix over B. Note that the N × N -
matrices over B can be considered a C∗-subalgebra of
operators on H ⊕N . To prove that (f (Aij))ij is posi-
tive, we will show that (fα(Aij))ij converges to (f (Aij))ij
weakly with respect to H ⊕N .
(This is suﬃcient, be-
cause the weak limit of positive operators is positive, and
each (fα(Aij))ij is positive.)
Let x, y ∈ H ⊕N be given. To show that (fα(Aij))ij
converges to (f (Aij))ij in the weak operator topology we
must show that

(cid:104) (f (Aij) − fα(Aij))ij x, y (cid:105)

≡ (cid:80)

i,j (cid:104) (f (Aij) − fα(Aij)) xj, yi (cid:105)

(C2)

converges to 0 as α → ∞. Let i, j ∈ {1, . . . , N} be given.
Since fα converges pointwise in the weak operator topol-
ogy to f , (cid:104)(fα(Aij) − f (Aij))xj, yi(cid:105) converges in C to 0.
Thus the right-hand side of Equality (C2), being a ﬁnite
sum of such terms, converges to 0 as α → ∞. Thus f is
completely positive.

Corollary 51. Let A and B be von Neumann algebras.
Let (fα)α∈D be a net of completely positive linear maps
from A to B which converges pointwise ultraweakly to a
linear map f : A → B. Then f is completely positive.

Appendix D: Cauchy–Schwarz for 2-Positive Maps

The classical form of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is
that for any vectors x and y in a complex vector space X
with semi-inner product (cid:104)−,−(cid:105) we have
|(cid:104)x, y(cid:105)|2 ≤ (cid:104)x, x(cid:105) (cid:104)y, y(cid:105) .

Since any positive functional ϕ on a C∗-algebra A gives
a semi-inner product on A by (cid:104)a, b(cid:105) = ϕ(a∗b),

|ϕ(a∗b)|2 ≤ ϕ(a∗a) ϕ(b∗b).

This is known as Kadison’s inequality. We need the

Given a 2-positive linear

(cid:107)ϕ(a∗b)(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)ϕ(a∗a)(cid:107)(cid:107)ϕ(b∗b)(cid:107).

(cid:3) be a self-adjoint 2×2 matrix

over C. The following are equivalent.

1. T is positive;

2. T has positive eigenvalues;

3. T has positive determinant and positive trace;
4. p, q ≥ 0 and |a|2 ≤ pq.

Proof. We leave this to the reader.

Lemma 53. Let T ≡ (cid:2) P A

(cid:3) be a self-adjoint 2 × 2

matrix of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H . The
following are equivalent.

A∗ Q

1. T is positive.
2. P, Q ≥ 0, and for all x, y ∈ H ,

|(cid:104)Ay, x(cid:105)|2 ≤ (cid:104)P x, x(cid:105) (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105) .

(D3)

Moreover, if T is positive, then:

3. A∗A ≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107) Q
4. AA∗ ≤ (cid:107)Q(cid:107) P
5. (cid:107)A(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107)(cid:107)Q(cid:107)

Proof. (1 =⇒ 2) Let x, y ∈ H be given. Let us consider
adjoint. Further, given λ, µ ∈ C we have

T (cid:48) :=(cid:2) (cid:104)P x,x(cid:105) (cid:104)Ay,x(cid:105)
(cid:3). Since T is self-adjoint, T (cid:48) is self-

From this we see that as T is positive, T (cid:48) is positive.
Then by Lemma 52 we get (cid:104)P x, x(cid:105) ≥ 0, (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105) ≥ 0,
and |(cid:104)Ay, x(cid:105)|2 ≤ (cid:104)P x, x(cid:105) (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105). Hence P and Q are
positive, and Inequality (D3) holds.
(2 =⇒ 1) We must show that T is positive. Note
that T is self-adjoint since both P and Q are self-adjoint.
Given x, y ∈ H we have

(cid:28)(cid:20) P A
(cid:20)x
(cid:21)(cid:29)
(cid:28)(cid:20) (cid:104)P x, x(cid:105)

(cid:21)(cid:29)
(cid:3) is positive. By Lemma 52 we must
T (cid:48) :=(cid:2) (cid:104)P x,x(cid:105) (cid:104)Ay,x(cid:105)

So to show that T is positive, it suﬃces to show that
show that (cid:104)P x, x(cid:105) ≥ 0, (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105) ≥ 0, and |(cid:104)Ay, x(cid:105)|2 ≤
(cid:104)P x, x(cid:105)(cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105). The latter statement is Inequality (D3)
and holds by assumption. The other two statements fol-
low from P ≥ 0 and Q ≥ 0.
(3) Assume that T is positive. Let y ∈ H be given. We
must show that

(cid:104)Ay, x(cid:105)
(cid:104)A∗x, y(cid:105) (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105)

(cid:104)A∗Ay, y(cid:105) ≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107) (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105) .

(D4)

Note that 0 ≤ (cid:104)A∗Ay, y(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ay, Ay(cid:105) = |(cid:104)Ay, Ay(cid:105)|. So

|(cid:104)Ay, Ay(cid:105)|2 ≤ (cid:104)P Ay, Ay(cid:105) (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105)

by Ineq. (D3) with x = Ay

≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107)(cid:104)Ay, Ay(cid:105) (cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105)

since P ≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107) and 0 ≤ Q.

12
So either (cid:104)A∗Ay, y(cid:105) = 0 — in which case Inequality (D4)
holds trivially — or (cid:104)A∗Ay, y(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0 in which case we get

(cid:104)A∗Ay, y(cid:105) = (cid:104)Ay, Ay(cid:105) ≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107)(cid:104)Qy, y(cid:105) .

Thus A∗A ≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107) Q.
(4) follows by a similar reasoning as in 3.
(5) We have (cid:107)A(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)A∗A(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)(cid:107)P(cid:107)Q(cid:107) = (cid:107)P(cid:107)(cid:107)Q(cid:107)
since A∗A ≤ (cid:107)P(cid:107)Q by 3.

Theorem 54 (Cauchy–Schwarz for 2-positive maps).
Let f : A → B be a 2-positive map between C∗-algebras.
Then we have, for all a, b ∈ A :

1. f (b∗a) f (a∗b) ≤ (cid:107)f (a∗a)(cid:107) f (b∗b)

2. f (a∗b) f (b∗a) ≤ (cid:107)f (b∗b)(cid:107) f (a∗a)

3. (cid:107)f (a∗b)(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)f (a∗a)(cid:107)(cid:107)f (b∗b)(cid:107)

Proof. We may assume that B is a C∗-subalgebra of
the space of bounded linear operators B(H ) on Hilbert

space H . Since(cid:2) a∗a a∗b
is 2-positive we get that T := (cid:2) f (a∗a) f (a∗b)

(cid:3) is positive and f
(cid:3) is positive

(cid:3) ≡(cid:2) a∗ 0

Now apply Lemma 53.
