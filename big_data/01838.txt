Abstract

We construct wormhole-like solutions in the type IIA string theory.
These solutions represent wormholes in four-dimensions and are given by
the D2 branes within appropraited backgrounds ﬁelds. We present the
conditions on these ﬁelds which lead to the four-dimensional wormholes.
In the special case we show how the particular solution in the type IIA the-
ory leads to the dynamic wormhole. We also speculate about the number
of universes and the cosmological constant.

1 Introduction

Generally, a wormhole is constructed by imposing the geometrical requirement
on spacetime that there exists a throat but no horizon. Thus the wormholes
can be interpreted as connections between diﬀerent universes or topological
handles between distant parts of the same universe. Hence the spacetime with
the wormholes has the nontrivial topology. The conception of the wormhole was
ﬁrst introduced by Einstein and Rosen in 1935 [1]. Moreover there are proposals
how to distinguish ( astrophysical) black holes from wormholes [2, 3].
It is
known that wormholes usually cannot occur as classical solutions of gravity due
to violations of the energy conditions [4-8] thus the non-exotic matter produces
only spacetime with trivial topology.

It is known that the source of backgrounds which have geometries with non-
trivial topology are space-time extended objects called branes. Hence one can
try to obtain the wormhole solution in such backgrounds. Among the branes
are D-branes which are the degrees of freedom in string theory. On the classical
level a D-brane is a submanifold M on which the ends of the string terminated.
Hence the D-brane corresponds to the Dirchlet boundary conditions that have
been put on the open string. The dimensions of the D-branes depend on the
string theory considered. From the other side the branes are solutions of the low
energy approximation of the string theory by a ﬁeld theory (supergravity). In

1

this approximation the equations of motion involve ﬁelds from Neveu-Schwarz
(NSNS) and Ramond-Ramond (RR) sectors: the graviton, the dilaton and the
other various antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds. The solutions of these equations form
backgrounds in which the string and D-branes are propagating. In the super-
gravity approximation of the string theory the evolution of a D-brane is de-
scribed by the non-linear Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action which consists of the
background ﬁelds which are pulled-back on the world-volume of the D-brane.
Hence the evolution of such D-branes depend on these ﬁelds and the internal
geometry of the D-brane. Thus the D-brane is propagating in the background of
branes and ﬁelds which are ﬁeld theoretic solutions. We ask: can the equations
governing the D-brane evolution be interpreted as the equations for the worm-
hole in four dimensions? We will show that such an interpretation is possible
for some backgrounds. As a result we will obtain the Lorentzian wormhole. In
string theory the Euclidean wormholes were considered in [9-12].

The aim of this paper is to the relate four-dimensional wormholes to the
solutions of string theory. We present backgrounds with branes which lead to
the wormholes in four dimensional spacetime.

In section 2 we recall the construction of the wormholes and equations of
motion. In section 3 we reproduce these equations from DBI action and consider
a type IIA string background with a D2 brane. This D2 brane can be interpreted
as the dynamic wormhole. As an example we consider a special background
which leads to the wormhole. In section 4 we speculate about the wormholes,
the number of universes and the observed value of the cosmological constant

Λ ≃ 1.21 × 10−52(cid:2)1/m2(cid:3) in the observed universe. Section 5 is devoted to

conclusions.

2 Wormholes

In order to obtain a space-time with a wormhole one does a so called surgery
procedure (see [4, 5]). In the four dimensions one starts by taking two copies M4
of the same spacetime and remove a four dimensional region Ω from the one M4
and from the second M4. As a result one obtains two spacetimes M + and M −.
These spacetimes M + and M − are joining together along the three-dimensional
boundary ∂Ω ≡ Σ = R1 × Σ2, where Σ2 is a two-dimensional surface, so a new
spacetime

M = M + ∪R1×Σ2 M −

is obtained. In the general case the linear size ρ of Σ2 is time-dependent ρ =
ρ (τ ), where τ is the proper time on Ω. The spacetime M is the manifold without
boundary that has a “kink” in the geometry at ρ (τ ). The joining can be made
in two ways:

1.

result is a wormhole spacetime Mw with two asymptotic regions.

if one joins together the two external regions r ∈ (ρ (τ ) ,∞), then the
2. if one joins together the two internal regions r ∈ (0, ρ (τ )), then the result

is a closed baby universe Mb.

2

In the case of the wormhole spacetime Mw with the spherical symmetry the
surface Σ2 is two dimensional sphere with a radius ρ and Σ2 satisﬁes the ﬂare-
out condition: in both sides of M4, surfaces of constant r increase their areas as
one moves away from Σ2; thus one says that Mw has a throat at r = ρ, which
can be time-dependent. So the topology of the dynamic wormhole S is:

S ≈ R1 × Σ2.

As is well-known the spherically symmetric Lorentzian wormhole, a la Morris
and Thorne [4], is deﬁned through the speciﬁcation of two arbitrary functions
b (r) and ϕ (r) with a line element ds2 = gµνdxµdxν :

ds2 = −e2ϕ(r)dt2 +

1

1 − b (r) /r

dr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2).

(2.1)

Hence the evolution of the wormhole S is determined by the Einstein equa-

tions projected on R1 × Σ2, that is, by the Lanczos equations:

− [Kαβ] + [K]egαβ = 8πGSαβ,

where on the left hand of the equation the symbols have meaning: egαβ is the
metric on S, the bracket [Kαβ] denotes the jump: [Kαβ] = K +
αβ across
the hypersurface R1 × Σ2 and [K] = egαβ [Kαβ], where K ±
αβ is the extrinsic
curvature tensor of S in M ±. On the right side of the eq. (2.2) Sαβ is the
surface stress-energy tensor on S.

αβ − K −

In the special case the metric (2.1) takes the form:

(2.2)

ds2 = −V 2 (r) dt2 + V −2 (r) dr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2)

(2.3)
and the wormhole S is the 3-dimensional spacetime with the topology: R1 × S2
which is embedded in M4 as follows:

where the embedding X is:

X : R1 × S2 → S ⊂ M4

X (τ , θ, φ) = (t (τ ) , ρ (τ ) , θ, φ) ∈ M4,

the time-like coordinate t and the radius ρ of the sphere S2 depend on proper

(where α = τ , θ, φ):

time τ and (θ, φ) ∈ S2. The induced metric egαβ = ∂αX µ∂βX νgµν on S is

and ”dot” means diﬀerentiation on τ e.g.
unit tangent vectors T(a) = ∂αX µ∂µ: one is time-like: T(τ ) = ∂τ X µ∂µ :

It means that S is the time-like submanifold. In the orthonormal frame eµ
metric (2.1) takes the form:

bµ the

νη bµbνdxµdxν ,

where the tetrad ﬁeld ebµ

µ is:

e =(cid:16)ebµ

µ(cid:17) = diag(cid:0)V, V −1, r, r sin θ(cid:1) ,
and(cid:0)ηbµbν(cid:1) = diag (−1, +1, +1, +1). The inverse tetrad eµ
e−1=(cid:16)eµ

bµ(cid:17) = diag(cid:0)V −1, V, r−1, r−1 sin−1 θ(cid:1). The function V (r) is positive

for r > rh > 0 thus the radius of the throat ρ (τ ) of the wormhole is bigger
then the biggest positive root of V (r). It means that the classical wormhole
has not horizon. The eigenvalues of the operator of the second fundamental
form bn (·) = −∇·n of S give the matrix of the extrinsic curvature Kµν in the
orthonormal frame Kbµbν = Kµνeµ
bν. Since in our case are two normal vectors
n± thus we get two extrinsic curvature K ±

bµ has the components:

The surface stress-energy tensor Sαβ (for a perfect ﬂuid) in the orthonormal
frame is:

where σ and η are an energy density and a surface tangential pressure, localized
on S, respectively. Hence the Lanczos equations (2.2) take the form:

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

From the other side the above equations are obtained from the Hilbert-Einstein
action using the thin shell formalism [5-7]. In this formalism the Riemann tensor
in the vicinity of the thin shell given by the equation W (x) = 0 has the form:

Rµνρσ = − ([Kµρ] nν nσ − [Kµσ] nνnρ + [Kνσ] nµnρ − [Kνρ] nµnσ) δ (W ) +

The special form of V is considered in [8].

In the next section we will be interpreting the wormhole as a D2 brane with
the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action in the background ﬁelds of the type IIA
string theory. It means that D2 brane connects two copies of the four dimen-
sional spacetime M4. From the other side the consistent spacetimes obtained in
the type IIA are Minkowski or anti-de Sitter. Thus the form of V 2 is: V 2 = +1
for Minkowski and V 2 (r) = 1 + |Λ|

3 r2 for anti-de-Sitter.

3 DBI action for D2-brane and wormhole

The background ﬁelds of Type IIA consist of: the metric gMN , the two-form
B = BMN dX M ∧ dX N and the dilaton Φ and the gauge ﬁelds C(i) (they are
i-forms) with i = 1, 3. These gauge ﬁelds are coupled to the D2 and D4 branes.
The action for the one D2 brane is given by the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action:

S = −T2ZM3
T2ZM3Xi

e−Φ(cid:0)− det(cid:0)γαβ + 2πα′Fαβ + bαβ(cid:1)(cid:1)1/2
c(i) ∧ exp (2πα′F + b) ,

d3ξ +

(3.1)

6

where M3 is the world-volume of D2-brane embedded into a background man-
ifold M10:
(3.2)
The signature of the metric gMN is (−, +, ...+). All the ﬁelds in the DBI action
are the pull-back of the background ﬁelds by the embedding X:

X : M3 → M10.

γ = X ∗ (g) , b = X ∗ (B) , c(i) = X ∗(cid:0)C(i)(cid:1)

except for the abelian ﬁeld Fαβ which is the gauge ﬁeld on the D2-brane. Hence
the Wess-Zumino (WZ) term is:

ZM3Xi

c(i) ∧ exp (2πα′F + b) =ZM3(cid:2)c(1) ∧ (2πα′F + b) + c(3)(cid:3) .

The term c(1) ∧ (2πα′F + b) has the form of the Chern-Simons term. Assuming
that D2-brane is spherically symmetric with the topology R1×S2 the embedding
X takes the form:

X (τ , θ, φ) =(cid:0)t (τ ) , r (τ ) , θ, φ, X 4

where τ ∈ R1. Thus the ﬁelds on the world volume have the form:

Here we are looking for a such background for D2 brane which will produce the
action obtained from the Hilbert-Einstein action and leads to the equation of
motion for the throat radius ρ. In the Appendix the explicit form of DBI action
is presented. In order to obtain the action (2.25) one needs to put constraints

on the background ﬁelds. Since in this action no terms linear in
thus one can see that (see Appendix):

These system of equations (3.11) has one simple solution: Btφ = Brφ = Btθ =
Brθ = 0. Hence the DBI action takes the form:

where A, f and Ψt, Ψr, ΨF are given in the Appendix. If one puts the gauge
γτ τ = −1 in (3.6), than the above action becomes:

(3.13)

The signs ± follow from the two solutions of the equation γτ τ = −1 with
·
respect to
t. The sign + corresponds to increasing of the coordinate time t.
Here we chose the sign + but we remember that there is the second solution
with decreasing time t. One can see that the ﬁrst part of the DBI action can be
interpreted as the lagrangian for the matter on the throat of the four dimensional
wormhole where A corresponds to the ”magnetic” component of F and B while
f is related to the ”electric” part of F . The WZ term generates dynamics of D2
brane described by the one degree of freedom r which corresponds to the radius
of the throat. From the above action with the Lagrangian L:

ε =

(3.17)

Ψt ≥ 0.

(3.18)

This is the general condition on the background ﬁelds in which the D2-brane
can be interpreted as the wormhole in the type IIA.

Next we consider the background produced by the spherically symmetric
Dp-brane [13-15] which leads to the wormhole interpretation of the D2-brane.
The background metric gMN is:

where dx2 = dxidxi and i = 1, ..., p. The metric on a unit round sphere S8−p is
denoted as: dΩ2

8−p. The functions Zp and K are:

and

p = dp (2π)p−2 gsN α′(7−p)/2

(3.22)
with the numerical factor dp = 27−2pπ(9−3p)/2Γ ((7 − p) /2). There is the dilaton
Φ:

and the antisymmetric ﬁeld B = 0. The number N is the Dp-brane R–R charge

C(p+1) =

gs(cid:20)

1

Zp (r) − 1(cid:21) dX 0 ∧ dX 1 ∧ ... ∧ dX p.

(3.24)

The background metric has the horizon given by rH related to the ADM mass
of the Dp-brane and the singularity is at r = 0. Since we are in the frame of the
type IIA the dimensions of Dp-branes are: p = 0, 2, 4, 6. The only non vanishing
component of C(p+1) is:

C(p+1)t1...p =

gs(cid:20)

Zp (r) − 1(cid:21) .

(3.25)

For the D2-brane in the above background we get (because B = 0):

Ψt = AC(1)t and ΨF = Ψr = 0,

(3.26)

where A = 2πα′Fθφ is the magnetic ﬁeld on the D2-brane. Hence one can see
that the non-trivial background p-form C(p) is for p = 0. The metric (3.19) for
this background is:

The equation (3.16) makes sense in this background only if AC(1)t > 0. Thus

In order to get the above formula we used the equation (3.29) which leads to
the relation: r7

obtained that the evolution of the radius of the throat r corresponds to a particle
motion in the potential −V . From the other side the background metric (3.19)
has the horizon given by rH . This horizon corresponds to xH = (1/α0)− α0 > 0
and x+ > xH . Thus the wormhole would be visible for a observer at inﬁnity if
the motion is conﬁned to the interval: (xH , x+]. The equation (3.31) is highly
complicated. In order to get some prediction concerning to behavior of x we
approximate V by a square polynomial v (x) = ax2 + bx + c. The coeﬃcients
a, b and c are obtained from the relations:

v (xm) = V (xm) , v′ (xm) = 0 and v′′ (xm) = V ′′ (xm) ,

(3.34)

10

where xm is the maximum of the function: V ′ (xm) = 0 and V ′′ (xm) < 0.
Hence we obtain:

where V ′′

m = V ′′ (xm) and Vm = V (xm). Moreover we demand that:

V (0) = v (0) = 0 and V (x+) = v (x+) = 0.

so: xm = x+/2 and V ′′
approximation the equation (3.31) reads:

Location of the horizon corresponds to xH = 3/2.

Thus in this quadratic approximation the equation (3.36) with the initial

(3.38)

Hence the evolution of the throat radius r is conﬁned to the domain:

r+ ≥ r > rH ,

(3.40)

(3.41)

(3.42)

(3.43)

r (τ ) = r0

7px (τ ).

The requirement r > rH is implicated by the fact that rH is the horizon in the
background metric (3.19). In otherwise the D2 wormhole has the throat under
the horizon (with the radius rH ) of the background metric and becomes ”invis-
ible” for an observer at inﬁnity. This condition is accomplished by the above
solution. Hence we obtained in the IIA string theory the transient wormhole
with the time dependent throat r given by (3.43).

4 Vacuum energy and wormholes

The vacuum energy obtained form the quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) depends on
the energy scale up to which we trust the theory. The cutoﬀs of the energy
changing from the order of supersymmetry breaking scale (which is probably of
the order 10-100TeV or bigger) to the Planck scale. Hence the vacuum energy
density is changing from 10−64 to 1 in the Planck units.

From the other side the observation of the apparent luminosity of distant
supernovae [16, 17] indicates that the expansion of the universe has recently
begun to accelerate. In order to explains this unexpected acceleration one in-
troduced so called ”dark energy”. The observation leads to value of the dark
energy density which is equal to (1.35 ± 0.15)× 10−123. Next this energy density
is identify with the cosmological constant Λ. Expressing Λ in meter−2 one ob-
tains the value Λ ≃ 1.21× 10−52(cid:2)1/m2(cid:3). Moreover as turn outs the dark energy

is experimentally indistinguishable from vacuum energy. But as one can see
the theoretical vacuum energy (obtained from the quantum ﬁeld theory) is in
huge discrepancy with the observed dark energy represented by the cosmological
constant.

12

We propose a mechanism for an explanation of this discrepancy. This mech-
anism is based on the assumption that there are wormholes of the Planck size
and that the vacuum energy is ﬂowed across these wormholes. But not all en-
ergy can be drained by the wormholes. Since the throats rw of wormholes are
the size of the Planck length lP l the energy which can be ﬂowed by the one
wormhole is: Ew = ¯hc/rw. Hence we get the following equation:

Ec − Eo = N Ew,

(4.1)

where Ec is the vacuum energy in the volume V obtained from QFT, Eo is the
vacuum energy in this same volume V obtained from the cosmological observa-
tions: Eo = ΛV c4/ (4πG) and N is the number of the wormholes in V . Thus
the density number n = N/V of wormholes expressed in units [1/m3] is:

1
4π

rwΛ
l2

P l (cid:18) Ec

Eo − 1(cid:19) = n.

(4.2)

This number crucially depends on the cutoﬀ of the energy scale via Ec. Because
the vacum energy density represented by Λ is constant the excces of energy
should ﬂowed to the other universes which are connected to our universe by
these wormholes. If we assume that supersymmetry exists, then the number
of other universes will be depend on the fundamental supersymmetry breaking
scale ESUSY . It means that the universes with diﬀerent values of ESUSY will
have diﬀerent number connected universes by the wormholes. For example if
the breaking scale is of order 100TeV, then: Ec/Eo ≃ 1060. Thus we get that
the number density of the wormholes with the size of throats lP l is equal to:

n ≃ 1042.

(4.3)

The observable universe has volume 1080 (in cubic meters m3) so the total
number N of the wormholes in the observable universe is 10122. Hence the
number of other universes connected to our by the wormholes is: 10122. It will
be interesting relate this number to the number of vacua obtained from the
string theory landscape.

5 Conclusions

The purpose of this paper was relate the four-dimensional lorentzian wormholes
to the backgrounds of string theory. From the dimensional arguments we get
that the appropriate backgrounds are given by the type IIA string theory. We
related DBI action for D2 brane to the action of dynamic wormhole. This
relation between these actions led us to the conditions on the backgrounds with
the D2 branes which can be interpreted as the wormholes in the four dimensional
spacetimes. These spacetimes had to be asymptotically Minkowski or anti-de
Sitter. The background ﬁelds acquired interpretation of the matter on the throat
of the wormhole. The dynamics of the throat is obtained from WZ term in
the DBI action. In this way the four-dimensional wormhole took on the form

13

of D2 brane in the type IIA supergravity approximation of the string theory.
The energy condition on the matter supporting the wormhole is given by eq.
(3.18). As the example we considered special solution of IIA which produced
the transient wormhole. We also speculated about the relation of number of
universes, the value of the cosmological constant and supesymmetry breaking
scale.

det (g + B) = g1g2g3 + b2
