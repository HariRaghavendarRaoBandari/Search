Abstract

We present a Rvachev function method with the Chebysev col-
location for the stability analysis of ﬂuid ﬂow. The strategy is to
construct an approximate solution that satisﬁes all boundary condi-
tions exactly. As an example, we consider the stability problem of the
two-dimensional ﬂow of an incompressible viscous liquid near a circu-
lar cylinder. The results coincide well with the reference data. The
method is simpler than the widely used spectral/hp element method,
in particular because it does not require mesh generation, and the
collocation algorithm does not handle the boundary conditions or any
geometric information.

Introduction and problem formulation

The development of new numerical methods that will be more eﬃcient than
existing ones is an important and interesting problem of computational ﬂuid
dynamics. A group of little-known methods for boundary value problems
exists, based on Rvachev functions (see the review [9]). The Rvachev method
allows picking out geometric and boundary conditions data from a numeric
algorithm, which leads to signiﬁcant simpliﬁcations. Some examples of this
method in ﬂuid mechanics and a bibliography are presented in [13].

We consider the stability problem of an incompressible two-dimensional
ﬂow near a circular cylinder as a test case. This ﬂow has been well-studied

and the numerical results can be checked by comparison with the data from
[2, 1, 7]. The problem of hydrodynamic stability is useful for the exploration
of numerical methods, as it requires high quality approximation and yet is
easier than time-dependent problems. Also, ﬂow stability analysis plays an
important role in understanding the process of a laminar ﬂow’s becoming
turbulent.

The references [11, 12] review the linear instability analysis of ﬂows in
complex two-dimensional (2D) and 3D geometries. This research area is
called global stability (or instability) analysis. These articles describe the
methodology and main results of global stability analysis from the past three
decades.
It includes ﬁnite element and ﬁnite volume methods, ﬁnite dif-
ferences methods, and spectral methods. High-order methods are strongly
preferable when they allow of minimizing the computational cost. One of
the best and most widely used techniques is the spectral/hp element method
[5], which employs meshes with rectangular or (and) triangular elements in
complex domains. In each element of the computational domain, the solu-
tion is represented by a series of high order polynomials. Recent approaches
in global stability analysis include: cavity and duct ﬂows, ﬂows near airfoils
and cylinders, ﬂows over steps and in corners, jet ﬂows, etc.

The method proposed below is simpler than the spectral/hp element
method, in particular because it does not require generating a mesh or the
numerical algorithm’s handling either the boundary conditions or any geo-
metric information. Suppose the x-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system is
collinear with the free-stream ﬂow velocity and that the origin of this coordi-

boundary is deﬁned by Ωc (see Fig. 1). The y-axis is perpendicular to the
x-axis. The computational domain is the rectangle Ω with dimensions L, L1,
and Ly.

Our interest is in the evolution of inﬁnitesimal disturbances of a base ﬂow.
According to [4, 11, 12, 1], the linearized Navier–Stokes equations governing
these disturbances are found by substituting

Ψ = Ψ0(x, y) + ψ(x, y)eCt,

(2)

into (1) and keeping the linear terms.
In (2), Ψ0(x, y) denotes the base
ﬂow, ψ(x, y)eCt is the inﬁnitesimal disturbance, ψ(x, y) the amplitude, C =
X + 2πiY , X the growth rate, and Y is the frequency of the disturbance.
The resulting equations are

where derivatives are denoted by subscripts, U and V are the x and y com-
ponents of the base ﬂow (U = (Ψ0)y, V = −(Ψ0)x), and ∆ = ∂

boundary conditions we consider are simple homogeneous on all boundaries

2 Methodology

A solution structure is a function that satisﬁes the boundary conditions ex-
actly and contains the necessary degrees of freedom in order to approximate
a solution of the problem. According to [13, 9], for the considered problem,

3

a solution structure can be written

n(cid:88)

k(cid:88)

aijTi(x)Tj(y),

(5)

ψ = ω2

i=0

j=0

where ω(x, y) is the boundary distance function, T (x) and T (y) are Cheby-
shev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind on appropriate intervals, and the aij are
unknown coeﬃcients. The set of collocation points is chosen as the set of
zeros of the Chebyshev polynomials. We posit that (5) satisﬁes the equation
(3) at the set of collocation points and get the algebraic eigenvalue problem

Av = CBv,

(6)

where v = {a00, a01, . . . , an(k−1), ank}.

So we carry out the discretization in coeﬃcient space.
Iteration methods implemented by the SLEPc software package [3] have
been used for the eigenvalue problem (6). We compute the part of spectrum
with the largest growth rates.

The boundary distance function ωΓ is considered as a function which
should only be equal to zero on the boundary Γ. This function changes sign
only on the boundary. Obviously, the boundary function may be guessed for
simple geometrical ﬁgures such as lines or circles. For complex domains, this
function is constructed by algebraic combination (conjunction or disjunction)
of more simple ﬁgures by R-operations (see works[13, 9, 8]). For example,
R-conjunction makes

ωΩ(x, y) = xS1 ∧◦ xS2 ≡ xS1 + xS2 −

where the boundary distance function of rectangle ωΩ(x, y) has been obtained

from the functions of two stripes xS1 = k1(L2
L)(L1 − x). For the cylinder, we consider the boundary distance function
as ωΩC = −k3(x − L − 10)(x2 + y2 − 0.25) and use the R-conjunction (7)
again(see Figure 2):

Here, k1 = k3 = 0.01, k2 = 0.1, and the common multiplier k4 = 100.

For analytical computations of boundary functions we use the Maxima
computer algebra system. This method allows us to manipulate simple ge-
ometry, but it is adequate for our method demonstration with only standard
software. The methods of calculation of the boundary distance function are
reviewed in work [10], as it states that such a function may be calculated
fully automatically for arbitrary complex geometry using the special soft-
ware SAGE [10] and POLE [8].

The base ﬂow was computed using the spectral/hp element frame-
work Nektar++, but any ﬂow solver may be used instead, for example,
OpenFoam, CodeSaturne, etc. The dimensions of the domain are taken
to be L = 100, L1 = 20 and Ly = 10. A uniform ﬂow (U = U∞, V = 0)
is imposed at the inﬂow, top, and bottom boundaries; no-slip conditions are
imposed on the cylinder surface. A zero traction condition is imposed at the
outﬂow boundary of the domain. The base ﬂow can be stabilized by setting
V = 0 at y = 0 in the cylinder trace as recommended in [2, 1]. An unstruc-
tured triangle mesh was obtained from the grid generator gmsh. The ﬂow
ﬁelds were veriﬁed by data from the review [7].

We have proved the method for the example of the stability problem of plane
Pouiseuille ﬂow [6]. In this work, the authors have compared his method with
the spectral/hp element method using the Nektar++ framework. These
two approaches are similar in terms of precision and calculation time, but
not in terms of memory volume. Our method requires a high volume of
memory for the big dense matrices A and B.

The size of the domain is taken to be smaller than that for the base ﬂow:
L = 50, Ly = 7.5, and L1 = 10. We compute growth rates X for some
range of n and k in order to verify and validate the method. The results are
presented in Table 1 for Re = 45, Re = 46, Re = 47, Re = 50.

The conclusion based on the data in Table 1 is that increasing the number
of modes above some limit does not lead to an increase in precision. We as-
sume that the cause of the lost precision is errors at the stage of the algebraic
eigenvalue problem. Methods for large dense algebraic eigenvalue problems
are still not suﬃciently investigated and are frequently unstable.

Figures 3 and 4 show the growth rates and frequencies as functions of the
Reynolds number(L = 50, Ly = 5, and L1 = 10; n = 200 and k = 60). This
result matches the data from [2]. The number of collocation points is on the
x-axis is n = 200, and on the y-axis, k = 60. The critical Reynolds number
lies between 45 and 46, which is close to the result from [2, 1]. Figures 5 and
6 show the streamlines of the real part of the leading eigenmode at Re = 30
(stable) and Re = 80 (unstable), L = 25, L1 = 5 and Ly = 5.

So we can conclude that the new method has an error value close to that of
the spectral/hp-element method, but is simpler and allows problems similar

6

to those in the reviews [11, 12] to be solved. The simplicity of the method lies
in the separation of geometric data from the computation algorithm. The
solution structure (5) was determined once before the start of calculations
and contains the boundary conditions and shape of the domain. Further ones
can construct the algorithm as the usual spectral scheme. The method does
not directly manipulate the geometric data and boundary conditions at this
stage and can be realized more simply than the ﬁnite diﬀerence and ﬁnite
element methods. Of cource, when including R-function theory and solution
structure construction algorithms, the method is more complicated.
