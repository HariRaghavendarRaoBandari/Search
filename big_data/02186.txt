The mean ﬁeld approximation is formulated within the framework of the density ﬁeld theory to study the prop-
erties of a Maier-Saupe nematogenic ﬂuid near a hard wall. The density and the order parameter proﬁles are
obtained using the analytical expressions derived in the linearized mean ﬁeld approximation. The temperature
dependencies of the contact values of the density and order parameter proﬁles are analyzed in detail. To esti-
mate a validity of the applied approximations, the obtained theoretical results are compared with the original
computer simulation data.

1. Introduction

It is a great pleasure and a big honor for us to contribute this paper to the festschrift dedicated to
Professor Stefan Sokołowski. Stefan is a well-known expert on the modelling of physico-chemical proper-
ties of complex ﬂuids such as chemically reacting ﬂuids in disordered porous media [1, 2], studies of the
isotropic-nematic phase transition in conﬁned nematic ﬂuids [3], modelling of the properties of ﬂuids in
pores with walls decorated with tethered polymer brushes [4], treatment of phase behavior in conﬁned
functional colloids [5] and many other complex ﬂuids in complex conﬁnements.

In this paper, we study the inﬂuence of the surface on a nematic ﬂuid near a hard wall. Due to ori-
entational ordering, such systems have many unique properties which are very important in the display
industry. The anchoring phenomena are among them, according to which the surface induces a speciﬁc
orientation of the nematic director with respect to the surface [6]. In order to understand the connec-
tion between the anchoring phenomena and the interaction between nematic molecules and the surface,
there the Henderson-Abraham-Barker (HAB) approach previously developed for isotropic ﬂuids at the
wall [7] has been employed [8, 9]. In this approach, the distribution of the ﬂuid near the wall is described
by the wall-particle Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation with the ﬂuid distribution function in the bulk calcu-
lated in the mean spherical approximation (MSA) [10]. Using this approach, it is possible to evaluate the
role of an orientation-dependent interaction of nematic molecules with the surface in the anchoring phe-
nomena. However, in the MSA, the HAB approach does not correctly take into account the contribution
from long-range intermolecular interactions. As a result, it does not satisfy an exact relation known as
the contact theorem, which was formulated in [11, 12] for isotropic ﬂuids near a wall, and recently in [13]
it was reformulated for anisotropic ﬂuids near a hard wall. According to this theorem, the contact value

of the density proﬁle of a ﬂuid near a hard wall is determined by the pressure of the ﬂuid in the bulk. In
[13], the contact theorem was also formulated for the order parameter proﬁle.

An alternative way of describing ﬂuids at a hard wall was developed within the framework of the
density ﬁeld theory. In this theory, the contributions from the mean ﬁeld and from ﬂuctuations are sep-
arated. The theory was successfully applied to ionic ﬂuids at a hard wall [14–17] and to simple ﬂuids
with Yukawa-type interactions near a hard wall [18, 19]. It was shown that the mean ﬁeld treatment of a
Yukawa ﬂuid at a hard wall reduces to the solution of a non-linear differential equation for the density
proﬁle, while the treatment of ﬂuctuations reduces to the OZ equation with the Riemann boundary con-
dition [20]. The density ﬁeld theory was applied to the description of bulk properties of a nematic ﬂuid
in [21, 22]. The application of the density ﬁeld theory to the description of a nematic ﬂuid at a hard wall
was initiated in [23].

In this paper, we use the mean ﬁeld approximation to investigate the effect of a hard wall on the
properties of a nematic ﬂuid. We demonstrate the principal difference between the behavior of the order
parameter proﬁle obtained in the mean ﬁeld approximation and its linearized version. In order to check
the validity of both approaches we compare the obtained theoretical results with computer simulations
data.

2. Theory

In this paper, we consider Maier-Saupe (MS) nematogenic ﬂuid model [24, 25] as one of the simplest
models that accounts for the isotropic-nematic phase transition. For simpliﬁcation, we consider a ﬂuid of
point uniaxial nematogens interacting through the pair potential

ν(r12, Ω1Ω2) = ν0(r12)+ ν2(r12)P2(cos θ12),

(1)

where the ﬁrst term ν0(r12) = (A0/r12) exp (−α0r12) describes isotropic repulsion and the second term
with ν2(r12) = (A2/r12) exp (−α2r12) describes anisotropic attraction between particles (A0 > 0, A2 < 0),
r12 denotes the distance between particles 1 and 2, Ω =¡θ, φ¢ are orientations of particles, P2(cos θ12) =
(3 cos2 θ12 − 1)/2 is the second order Legendre polynomial of the relative orientation θ12.
It is necessary, in numerical calculations, to cut-off the potential ν(r12, Ω1Ω2) at some ﬁnite distance
and due to this in expression (1), ν0(r ) and ν2(r ) are replaced by ˜νi (r ) = νi (r ) for r É rc and ˜νi (r ) = 0 for
r > rc, where i = 0, 2 and rc is the cut-off radius.

Within the ﬁeld-theoretical formalism, the Hamiltonian is a functional of the density ﬁeld and can be

written as a sum of the entropic and the interaction terms

ρ(r, Ω) is particle density per angle such thatRρ(r, Ω)dΩ = ρ(r), ΛT is the thermal de Broglie wavelength
of the molecules, the quantity Λ−1

R is the rotational partition function for a single molecule [26].

2.1. Mean ﬁeld approximation

In this paper, we restrict our consideration to the mean ﬁeld (MF) approximation which is the lowest
order approximation for the partition function. In the canonical formalism, it corresponds to ﬁxing the
Lagrange parameter λ such that the following relation is true for the singlet distribution function

As a result, we have

2¢V2m(r, Ωw n) = −4πβA2S2m(r, Ωw n).

Due to translational invariance parallel to the wall, the functions considered depend only on the distance
z to the wall. Equations (10)–(15) make a set of six differential equations for the unknown functions

ρ(r, Ω1n, Ωw n ), S2m(r, Ωw n), E0(r, Ωw n), E2m(r, Ωw n), V0(r, Ωw n), V2m(r, Ωw n). We note that in the case
when the director is oriented perpendicularly to the wall, Ωw n = 0, the singlet distribution function is
axially symmetric. Consequently, the equations considered will retain only the terms with m = 0. In this
paper, we will restrict our further investigation to this special case.

As was shown in [23], the differential equations obtained can be solved analytically in the linear

approximation for the expression (6)

are identical to the parameters found in the bulk phase when Gaussian ﬂuctuations are taken into ac-
count [22] and characterize a decay of the isotropic repulsive and the anisotropic attractive interactions,
respectively.

Hereafter, the approach presented in this subsection is referred to as the linearized mean ﬁeld (LMF)
approximation. The expressions for ρ(z) and S∗20(z) obtained within this approximation correspond to
the case of inﬁnite cut-off radius rc → ∞.

2.3. Contact theorem

As it was shown in [13], the density and order parameter proﬁles satisfy some exact relations known
as the contact theorems. According to these relations in the absence of wall-particle interactions, the
contact values of the density proﬁle ρ(z = 0) and of the order parameter proﬁle S20(z = 0) do not depend
on the angle Ωw n and are equal to

ρ(z = 0) = βZ dΩ1n P (Ω1n) = βP,
S20(z = 0) = βZ dΩ1n P2(cos θ)P (Ω1n ),

(22)

(23)

where P is the bulk pressure and P (Ω1n ) can be treated as the bulk partial pressure for molecules with a
given orientation Ω1n.

was found which was used to prove the contact theorem for the MF density proﬁle of a nematogenic ﬂuid
in form (24). However, no similar proof of the contact theorem for the MF order parameter proﬁle in
form (25) exists.

3. Numerical calculation details

In order to verify the theoretical approaches presented in the previous section, a series of numerical
calculations were carried out. To this end, for the model pair potential (1), the following parameters were
chosen: A0/|A2| = 3.0 and α0/α2 = 1.6. It should be noted that all quantities marked by a star in our pa-
per are considered as non-dimensional. For instance, all distances are reduced as r ∗ = r α2 or z∗ = zα2,
densities are reduced as ρ∗ = ρ/α3
2 and temperature as T ∗ = kBT /(|A2|α2). The potential (1) is character-
ized by a rather soft repulsive part (isotropic contribution) and a small attractive part dependent on the
relative orientation between a pair of ﬂuid particles (anisotropic contribution). It is worth noting that the
considered ﬂuid is mostly a repulsive one, and a small attractive contribution affects mainly an orienta-
tional properties of the ﬂuid, at least at the conditions used in our study. In particular, we consider the
ﬂuid at the density ρ∗b = 1.0, and the temperature interval T ∗ = 0.5−3.5 is chosen. We have found that, at
these temperatures, the considered ﬂuid is beyond its vapour-liquid phase transition region. Therefore,
only a nematic-isotropic phase transition can be expected in our case.

To obtain a numerical solution of the integral equation (6) used in the MF approximation, the Picard
iterative method was applied. The problem was considered in the cylindrical coordinates, which are set
along z-axis normal to the wall surface. The integrations over z were performed using trapezoidal rule
with a step ∆z = 0.02/α2, while all integrations over r were done analytically. A step of integration over
cos(θ) was chosen as 0.0025. To take into account the conﬁnement, we consider a ﬂuid between two hard
walls at a distance Lz = 36/α2 to each other. Two cut-off radii rc = 6.0/α2 and 12.0/α2 are used in our
study. The chosen distance Lz appears to be suﬃcient to get a bulk-like region of a ﬂuid in the middle
between the two walls. The presence of the hard walls is introduced by the boundary conditions ρ(z) = 0
if z < 0 or z > Lz . Equation (6) is solved in combination with equation (10) leading to density ρ(z) and
order parameter S∗20(z) proﬁles. The precision of this solution expressed in terms of standard deviation
is 10−5.

The bulk order parameter Sb is used both in the MF and LMF calculations. To obtain this quantity,
the integral equation (5) was applied. It was also solved numerically by the iterative method, but here
with a precision 10−12 and with a step of integration over cos(θ) taken equal to 0.00125. The cut-off radii
rc = 6.0/α2 and 12.0/α2 were used to obtain Sb as well.

We compare the numerical results calculated from MF and LMF approaches with Monte-Carlo (MC)
simulation results. For this purpose, a series of MC simulations in canonical ensemble [27] were per-
formed to obtain Sb, ρ(z) and S∗20(z). A system of Np ﬂuid particles interacting with the pair potential (1)
were placed into a rectangular box of a size Lx×L y×Lz , where Lx = L y = 24/α2 and Lz = 4rc if rc = 6.0/α2
and Lz = 3rc if rc = 12.0/α2. For Lz taken in our simulations, a bulk-like region in the middle of the box

13608-5

M. Holovko et al.

is observable up to the temperature T ∗ = 2.2. Since the bulk ﬂuid density is set to ρ∗b = 1.0, a number
of ﬂuid particles Np is set to 13824 for the case of rc = 6.0/α2 and 20736 for the case of rc = 12.0/α2.
The simulations were carried out with the periodical boundary conditions applied in three dimensions
in the case of a bulk ﬂuid, and in X and Y dimensions in the case of a ﬂuid between two hard walls.
Each simulation procedure was performed at a constant temperature and volume and consisted of three
stages: 1) equilibration of a ﬂuid in a strong ﬁeld applied along Z -axis to give the ﬂuid particles a pref-
erential orientation, which was normal to the wall surfaces; 2) equilibration of the system obtained at
the previous stage with the ﬁeld switched off; 3) production of the necessary characteristics for a system
obtained at the second stage with the ﬁeld switched off. A criterium deﬁning an equilibrated system is a
stabilization of the total order parameter in the system, i.e., when the order parameter ﬂuctuates around
one average value during an essential number of MC steps, usually it was over 20 000 steps at least. It
should be noted that in our simulations, one MC step corresponds to Np trial translational or rotational
movements.

region up to the critical region of the nematic-isotropic phase transition, which appears at Sb < 0.443 [22]
(ﬁgure 1, left-hand panel). Also, it is observed that the results for r ∗c = 12.0 totally coincide with the case
of r ∗c → ∞ (ﬁgure 1, right-hand panel). The values of the order parameter obtained from the simulations
are systematically lower than in the MF approximations (ﬁgure 1, triangle symbols).

simulations. As has been shown above, this cut-off should be long enough to give results comparable to

the case r ∗c → ∞. It is observed that all presented proﬁles have the same qualitative behavior, i.e., they
have a distinct high maximum at the contact with the wall, then a minimum appears around z∗ = 0.5−1.0
and at z∗ > 5 one can see a convergence of ρ∗(z) to ρ∗b when the bulk-like region is reached. We note that
the contact values obtained in the MF and LMF practically coincide — the cut off correction is negligible,
while for ρ∗(0) obtained from the simulations, we observe some small difference. The contact value of
the obtained density proﬁles will be discussed more in detail later on. For this moment, we focus on ρ∗(z)
at distances z∗ > 0 and on comparison of the theoretical approaches with the computer simulations. One
can see that at small distances z∗, the LMF approximation agrees with the simulations better than the MF,
while the MF approximation describes ρ∗(z) better at distances z∗ around the minimum of ρ∗(z) and
larger. Moreover, at all temperatures considered in our study, the z∗-position of the minimum of ρ∗(z) is
very close in the MF approximation to that in the computer simulations, while in the LMF approximation,
the z∗-position of the minimum is notably shifted towards the higher values.

A different situation is observed for the order parameter proﬁle S∗20(z) of the MS ﬂuid near a hard
wall, which is presented in ﬁgure 3 as a normalized quantity ˜S(z) = S∗20(z)/Sb. We take such a presenta-

tion because of an essential deviation of the theory from the simulations results for bulk order parame-

ters (ﬁgure 1). Using the normalization we can consider all proﬁles on the same plot. Nevertheless, even
with this normalization, one can observe an important quantitative and qualitative difference between
not only the theory and simulations, but also between the MF and LMF approximations (ﬁgure 3). In the

LMF approximation, a minimum of ˜S(z) is found at z∗ = 0.54 and z∗ = 0.58 at T ∗ = 1.3 and T ∗ = 2.0,
respectively, while in the MF approximation no minimum has been noticed at all. At the same time, the
simulation results do not give any evidence of a ˜S(z) minimum either. In this context, the MF results are
similar to those obtained from simulations. However, all the considered approaches give completely dif-
ferent contact values of ˜S(z). The contact value of the order parameter obtained from the simulation is
the lowest one, then an essentially larger ˜S(z) is given by the MF approximation and the largest value of
˜S(0) close to 1.0 is calculated from the LMF approximation. In the bulk region (far enough from the wall),
all the proﬁles converge to 1.0 as expected. The only difference is found in the rates of this convergence,
which is lower in the MF approximation than in the LMF approximation, and in the simulations it is the
lowest one. Also, it is worth noting that the rate of convergence of S∗20(z) to Sb [i.e., ˜S(z) to 1.0] decreases
with the temperature.

Before discussing the contact values obtained in our study we will try to understand the behavior of
the order parameter proﬁle S∗20(z) and how it relates to the density proﬁle ρ∗(z). First of all, we have
noticed that the order parameter of ﬂuid particles next to the wall (z∗ → 0) is smaller than the bulk order
parameter Sb. However, the density proﬁles (ﬁgure 2) for the same z∗ is higher than the bulk density.
From the knowledge of the bulk, for which the higher density leads to the higher order parameter, one
can expect that the order parameter near the wall is also higher than Sb. Therefore, we encounter a con-
tradiction, since both the MF approximations and simulation predict the values of S∗20(z) smaller than Sb
everywhere except the bulk-like region where S∗20(z) is equal to Sb (ﬁgure 3). Apparently we are dealing
with two competing effects: densiﬁcation of ﬂuid particles near the wall, which should increase S∗20(z) at
small z∗ and the absence of ﬂuid particles beyond the wall, which should decrease S∗20(z). Following the
obtained results, one can conclude that the latter effect is more essential for the system considered in our
study.

4.3. Contact values

The density and order parameter proﬁles of a MS ﬂuid near a hard wall are used to calculate the cor-
responding contact values ρ∗(0) and S∗20(0) as functions of the temperature. These contact values can be
calculated from the expressions of the contact theorem (CT) (22) and (23), which in the MF approximation
reduce to the relations (24) and (25), respectively. In the LMF approximation, the contact values ρ∗(0) and
S∗20(0) satisfy the relations (24) and (25) automatically due to the boundary conditions applied in the so-
lution of the corresponding differential equation. In the MF approximation, the situation is different for
ρ∗(0) and S∗20(0). As it was shown in [23], the contact value for the density proﬁle ρ∗(0) satisﬁes the rela-
tion (24), although it has not been proven that the contact value of the order parameter S∗20(0) obtained
in the MF approximation should satisfy the relation (25).

CT) appears when the cut-off radius is equal to r ∗c = 6.0 (ﬁgure 4, left-hand panel). If the cut-off radius
is increased to r ∗c = 12.0, equivalent results are obtained in all of the approximations (ﬁgure 4, right-

hand panel). At the same time, the agreement between the theoretical approaches and the simulations is
mostly qualitative. We would like to draw attention to the non-monotonous behavior of the contact value
ρ∗(0) with a distinct minimum observed both in the simulations and in the theoretical predictions. To
understand this interesting effect, we should analyze the temperature dependence of the density contact
value more in detail.

As it is seen in ﬁgure 4, at low temperatures, ρ∗(0) is large and lowers as the temperature increases.
This is related to the reduction of the repulsive contribution of the pair potential (1). Since in our model
a soft repulsive interaction is used, it becomes weaker if the temperature increases. It should be noted
that the attractive part of the pair potential in our model is rather small and mainly affects orientational
properties of ﬂuid particles. At the same time, a relative orientation can indirectly strengthen the ﬂuid-
ﬂuid repulsion contribution by reducing the attractive interaction term. Therefore, at some point in the

nematic phase, when the order parameter remains suﬃciently small, the repulsion becomes stronger
causing an increase of the contact value ρ∗(0). This effect is observed in ﬁgure 4 at temperature T ∗ =
1.885, where ρ∗(0) reaches its minimum and starts to increase rapidly until the ﬂuid becomes totally
isotropic [S∗20(z) = 0]. In the isotropic phase, the ﬂuid particles are totally orientationally disordered, and
a further temperature increase leads to the weakening of the repulsion. Thus, a continuous decrease of
ρ∗(0) is obtained at high temperatures. It should be noted that the explanation presented here concerns
solely, models with a pair potential consisting of a soft-core term combined with a Maier-Saupe attractive
potential. In the case of a hard-core type of repulsive interaction, the temperature dependence can be
opposite and the effect of orientational ordering can be completely different.

While the contact value of the density proﬁle is rather understandable, the behavior of the contact
value of the order parameter proﬁle is not so clear. First of all, as it has been already shown, there is
an essential inconsistency between the MF and LMF approximations (ﬁgure 3). There is also a problem if
one compares the contact values S∗20(0) obtained in the MF and LMF approximations and those calculated
from the CT theorem. As can be seen in ﬁgure 5, the MF results signiﬁcantly differ from those of the LMF
and the CT. A perfect agreement of the LMF and the CT appears due to the deﬁnition of the boundary
conditions used in the LMF approximation, which are taken to ﬁt the CT theorem (25). A deviation of the

CT from the LMF is seen only for the case of r ∗c = 6.0 chosen in the CT (ﬁgure 5, left-hand panel). For

r ∗c = 12.0, the contact values of the order parameter of a MS ﬂuid obtained from the CT and the LMF
totally coincide. At the same time, the MF approximation gives much lower S∗20(0), although it is closer
to the simulation results than the CT and LMF. We assume that the difference between the CT and the
MF approaches is related to a poor description of the bulk partial pressure P (Ω1n). In order to improve
the results obtained from the CT (or the LMF approximation), one should take into account higher order
terms, for instance the Gaussian ﬂuctuations [22]. Also, it should be noted that in contrast to the CT and
LMF approximation, S∗20(0) obtained from the MF approximation and the simulations decays to zero
before the critical region is reached. Thus, the convex part of S∗20(0) is absent for them. It means that in
the critical region there is no orientational ordering of ﬂuid particles at a contact with the wall.

5. Conclusions

Within the framework of the density ﬁeld theory, we have formulated the mean ﬁeld (MF) approxi-
mation as a starting point for the theoretical description of a nematic ﬂuid at a hard wall. Using the devel-
oped approach we have investigated the density and order parameter proﬁles of a conﬁned Maier-Saupe
nematogenic ﬂuid with an isotropic Yukawa-like repulsion. Theoretical predictions have been compared
with analytical results obtained within the framework of the linearized mean ﬁeld (LMF) approxima-
tion [23]. For the density proﬁle, the results obtained in the MF and LMF approximations are in qual-
itative agreement with computer simulations data. For the order parameter proﬁle, the results of the
MF and LMF approximations have qualitatively different behaviors. In the LMF approximation, a min-
imum of the order parameter proﬁle is present, while in the MF approximation no minimum has been
observed. The results of computer simulations do not give any evidence of the existence of a minimum in
the z-dependence of the order parameter proﬁle either. In this context, the MF and computer simulations
results are qualitatively similar. This contradiction in the description of the density and order parameter
proﬁles within the framework of the LMF approximation is connected with the problem of the respective
contact theorems in forms (24) and (25) which are used as boundary conditions in the solution of the
corresponding system of differential equations. As it was shown in reference [23], the contact value of
the density proﬁle ρ(0) satisﬁes the relation (24) but the validity of the relation (25) for the contact value
of the order parameter S20(0) is not evident. Moreover, the comparison with the results of computer sim-
ulations in ﬁgure 5 shows that relation (25) is probably incorrect. As we can see from ﬁgure 5, the LMF
approximation can give a better result if we change the boundary condition for the order parameter pro-
ﬁle by correcting the contact value for S(0) obtained within the framework of the MF approximation. We
hope that the considered problem can be better understood by going beyond the MF approximation and
including a contribution from ﬂuctuations.

The temperature dependencies of the contact values of the density and order parameter proﬁles have
been analyzed more in detail. We have found a non-monotonous behavior of the density contact value
ρ(0) as a function of the temperature with a distinct minimum observed in both theoretical predictions
and computer simulations. This non-monotonous temperature dependence of ρ(0) is explained by the
competition of the soft isotropic repulsive and the soft anisotropic attractive contributions. For the con-
tact value of the order parameter, we have observed a monotonous decrease with an increase of tem-
perature. Both the simulations and the MF results indicate that there is no orientational ordering of ﬂuid
particles at the contact with the wall when the ﬂuid is in the critical region.

The results presented in this paper have been obtained within the framework of the MF approxi-
mation. We note that the agreement between theoretical predictions and computer simulation data is
mostly qualitative. For a better theoretical description one should take ﬂuctuations into account. For the
bulk properties of the model under consideration, the inﬂuence of the contribution from ﬂuctuations
was already discussed in reference [22]. It was shown that the singlet distribution function reduces to
the form (5) with a change of κ2
2/(λ0 + λ2). It was shown that the tempera-
ture trend of deviation between the order parameter Sb calculated with ﬂuctuations included and the MF
value is the same as that between computer simulations and the MF value presented in ﬁgure 1. In the
next paper we plan to include the contribution from ﬂuctuations in the description of a MS nematogenic
ﬂuid at a hard wall similar to the way it was done for isotropic Yukawa ﬂuids [18, 19].
