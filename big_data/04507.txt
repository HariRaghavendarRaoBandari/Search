Abstract / The search for Earth-like planets using the transit technique has encouraged the development of
strategies to obtain light curves with increasingly precision.
In this context we developed the FOTOMCAp
program. This is an IRAF quasi-automatic code which employs the aperture correction method and allows to
obtain high-precision light curves. In this contribution we describe how this code works and show the results
obtained for planetary transits light curves.

Introduction

1.
To date, more than 1900 extrasolar planets(cid:63) have been
discovered using diﬀerent detection methods. Almost 50
per cent of these new worlds were found by the Kepler
satellite (Borucki et al., 2010) through the techniques of
transit (Charbonneau et al., 2000; Henry et al., 2000)
and Transit Timing Variations or TTV (Holman & Mur-
ray, 2005). The analysis of data provided by the mission
has revealed a wide variety of planetary systems. Some
of the most amazing discoveries include the existence of
Earth-like planets located in the habitable zone of their
stars (Quintana et al., 2014; Jenkins et al., 2015), multi-
planetary systems with more than one transiting planet
(Masuda et al., 2013; Becker et al., 2015), or disintegrat-
ing minor planets orbiting a white dwarf (Croll et al.,
2015).

For ground-based observatories, the detection of
light curves with shallow minima caused by small tran-
siting planets represents an enormous challenge. Besides
the precautions taken to acquire the best possible data,
it is highly desirable that the procedure to obtain diﬀer-
ential magnitudes ensures the determination of the most
precise light curves. In this sense, almost all the groups
carrying out systematic photometric follow-ups to ﬁnd
planets have developed their own pipelines to analyse
the photometric data. However, most of these codes are
not publicly available.

In this contribution we present the quasi-automatic
program FOTOMCAp, written in IRAF language, de-
veloped to determine precise instrumental magnitudes.

In Section 2, we describe the code. In Section 3, we ex-
amine possible diﬀerences between the results obtained
with FOTOMCAp and those with our previous code
FOTOMCC. In Section 4 we compare several algorithms
to determine the stellar centre and ﬂux, and the sky level
value. Finally, in Section 5 we present our conclusions.

2. The FOTOMCAp code

The aim of this program is to automatically measure
instrumental magnitudes of several stars that belong
to a same ﬁeld for which a large number of images is
available, which is the usual scenario in the study of
planetary transits or variable stars. As input, this code
requires: a) all the images of the ﬁeld under study, b)
the values of diﬀerent parameters that characterize the
employed CCD (i.e. readout noise, gain, and saturation
level) and the telescope (i.e. primary mirror diameter
and the elevation of the observatory above sea level), c)
a ﬁle with information provided by the daofind task of
an i-number of previously selected bright and isolated
ﬁeld stars, and d) a reference image. This reference
image is chosen by the user considering that it contains
all the stars of interest and where each one presents
an optimum level of ADUs. As last requirement,
FOTOMCAp needs a shift estimation (in pixels) of the
positions of the stellar objects with respect to those
of the reference image. Once the centres of all the
stars in all the images are identiﬁed, the code carries
out a sequence of fully automatic steps to measure the
instrumental magnitude of each star in each image by
applying the method of aperture correction (Howell,

Poster

FOTOMCAp: a new quasi-automatic code for high-precision photometry

1989; Stetson, 1990). This method is performed by the
program as follows:

1) Magnitudes of the selected bright and isolated

stars are computed in two diﬀerent ways:

• Growth curves:

it consists in measuring diﬀerent
magnitudes for the same star by applying larger
and larger apertures each time. The ﬁnal magni-
tude adopted for the star, mCC, will be the one that
remains unchanged in spite of the fact that the aper-
ture size continues to increase.

• Signal-to-noise ratio (SN) curves:

it consists in de-
termining the value of SN (see Section 2.1) for the
same star by applying larger and larger apertures
each time. The ﬁnal magnitude adopted for the star,
mSN, will be that calculated considering the aperture
size for which SN is maximum.

For the determination of both, mCC and mSN, the code
employs the phot task within the DAOPHOT package.
The values of sky used to determine the stellar centre
and full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) required by
phot, are automatically measured by FOTOMCAp
in the surrounding area of each star and considering
the brightest stars in the ﬁeld, respectively. The sky
ring inner radius (annulus) is computed as the selected
aperture size plus 5 pixels, its thickness (dannulus) is
ﬁxed in 5 pixels and the sky level value inside it is
calculated by the algorithm MODE (see Section 4).

2) For each one of these i-stars, the program com-
putes the ∆mi=(mCC −mSN)i diﬀerence, and for every
image obtains a ∆m value calculated as the median of
the ∆mi. The ∆m value determined for a given image
constitutes the aperture correction for that image.

3) Finally, the instrumental magnitude, mins, of
every star in the ﬁeld is obtained as mins=mSN+∆m for
each image, where mSN is computed as we mentioned
in 1). The adopted errors are those computed by the
phot task.

Once FOTOMCAp stops running, it creates three ﬁles:
one containing relevant information, including the in-
strumental magnitudes and errors of all the stars in each
image, and the other two with the sky level and FWHM
values measured for all the images.

2.1. Determination of SN

The code automatically computes the SN through the
expression given by Merline & Howell (1995),

SN =

(cid:118)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:116)N(cid:63) + npix

(cid:32)

N(cid:63)

(cid:33)

,

1 + npix
nB

(NS + ND + N 2

R) + σ2
S

where N(cid:63) is the total number of photons collected from
the star inside the npix pixels that constitute the used

aperture. NS, ND and NR are the photons per pixel
coming from the sky, the dark current, and the readout
noise, respectively. In this equation it is assumed that
the sky has been estimated over an annulus covering
nB pixels. The σS term represents the contribution
from the atmospheric scintillation given by Dravins
et al. (1998),

σS = 0.09N(cid:63)

where X is the airmass, h the observatory altitude in
km, D the diameter of the telescope in cm, and texp is
the exposure time in seconds.

3. Comparison with the FOTOMCC code

FOTOMCC (Petrucci et al., 2013, 2015) is a pro-
gram written in IRAF language, developed to obtain
high-precision light curves. Unlike FOTOMCAp, FO-
TOMCC determines instrumental magnitudes only em-
ploying the technique of growth curves. In Figure 1, we
show the light curve of the same planetary transit ob-
tained with the FOTOMCAp (circles) and FOTOMCC
(squares) codes. It is important to mention that the dif-
ferential magnitudes were determined, in both cases, fol-
lowing the procedure described in Petrucci et al. (2013).
In Table 1, we present the standard deviation (σ),
useful number of images (Nima), and computer time em-
ployed to carry out the photometry (Tcomp) of the plan-
etary transit obtained with the two codes. The com-
parison between these values indicates that, in several
important aspects, FOTOMCAp considerably improves
the results that are obtained with FOTOMCC. For ex-
ample we can mention an increase in the number of use-
ful images to construct the light curve and a signiﬁcant
decrease in the standard deviation. The only drawback
is that the FOTOMCAp code requires up to four times
more computing time than FOTOMCC.

4. Comparison between the algorithms to

determine the stellar centre and ﬂux, and
the sky level value

The phot task, used to measure instrumental magni-
tudes, has diﬀerent algorithms to accurately determine
the stellar centre location, to compute the star’s ﬂux,
and to calculate the background sky value. To establish
the most precise algorithm, we compared in each case
the standard deviations (σ) of the resulting light curves
for a bright star and for a faint one (Table 2). Both

curves were shifted in the Y axis for better visualization.

objects belong to the same ﬁeld that the star presenting
the planetary transit shown in Figure 1.
As it can be seen, the diﬀerences between the values
of σ are at most ∼ 0.2 mmag for the brightest stars and
as much as ∼ 7 mmag for the faintest ones. However, it
is important to notice that for the faint stellar objects
these diﬀerences appear when the sky value is ﬁtted by
the CONSTANT algorithm.
If we exclude the results
obtained with this algorithm, the diﬀerences between
the values of σ are at most ∼ 3 mmag. Taking into
account that what the CONSTANT option does is to ﬁx
the sky to a value given by the user, which in this case
is the mean of the values of sky automatically measured
by FOTOMCAp, this result points out the need of using
more complex methods to ﬁt the background level when
precise light curves are expected for faint stars.

These results would indicate that, except for the
CONSTANT algorithm to determine the sky value, the
rest of the algorithms used to center the star, to calcu-
late the stellar ﬂux, and to measure the sky background
level would not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the com-
puted instrumental magnitudes.

5. Conclusions

In this contribution we present a new quasi-automatic
code, FOTOMCAp, developed in IRAF language. The
purpose of this code is to measure instrumental mag-
nitudes of several stars that belong to the same ﬁeld,
by using the method of aperture correction. Our re-
sults indicate that FOTOMCAp not only allows to com-
pute light curves with standard deviations smaller than
the ones obtained with the FOTOMCC program, but
also permits to employ a larger number of images than

the one used in our previous code. The only notice-
able drawback is that the computation time used by
FOTOMCAp is ∼ 4 times larger than the one used by
FOTOMCC. However, about this last point, we are cur-
rently working to improve the code eﬃciency and, in
that way, signiﬁcantly reduce the internal calculation
time.
