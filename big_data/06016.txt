Updated Study of a Precision Measurement of the W Mass
from a Threshold Scan Using Polarized e− and e+ at ILC

An updated study of measuring the W mass from a polarized threshold
scan at ILC is presented with an emphasis on evaluating scan strategies
that control experimental systematics. Highly longitudinally polarized
beams of electrons and positrons such as are feasible at ILC oﬀer sig-
niﬁcant advantages in terms of statistical power and in-situ control of
background. Eventual experimental precision of around 2 MeV can be en-
visaged from this technique. Further work on both the accelerator design
and theoretical uncertainties will likely be needed to take full advantage
of this opportunity.

Introduction
A future high energy e+e− collider is recognized as essential for a precision study of
the Higgs and the top quark [1]. It can also be a very powerful tool for advancing
measurements of precision electroweak observables [1–4]. One of those observables of
considerable importance is the W mass. Measurements from LEP2 and the Tevatron
have led to a current precision of 15 MeV [5]. Further improvements from long ex-
isting hadron collider data-sets at the Tevatron and LHC are possible, but given the
predominant systematic uncertainties will constitute major experimental and phe-
nomenological tours de force if and when they are realized.

The three most promising approaches to measuring the W mass at an e+e− collider

are:
Polarized Threshold Scan Measurement of the W+W− cross-section near thresh-

old with longitudinally polarized beams.

Constrained Reconstruction Kinematically-constrained reconstruction of W+W−
using constraints from four-momentum conservation and optionally mass-equality
as was done at LEP2.

Hadronic Mass Direct measurement of the hadronic mass. This can be applied
particularly to single-W events decaying hadronically or to the hadronic system
in semi-leptonic W+W− events.

The International Linear Collider (ILC) is designed to reach

Methods for measuring the W mass in e+e− colliders were explored extensively in the
LEP era, see [6, 7] and references therein.

with polarized beams and high luminosity and can be upgraded to
With the envisaged accelerator parameters and ILC operating scenarios [8], there
is a great potential for much improved measurements of the W mass. With the
example operating scenario H-20 from [8], one can envisage data-sets totaling up to
6200 fb−1 at center-of-mass energies of between 250 and 500 GeV. This is an energy
regime where the W mass can be measured using the constrained reconstruction and
hadronic mass techniques. The eventual uncertainty would almost certainly be limited
by experimental systematics. Previous rough estimates by the author in [4] suggest
experimental systematics on the 3-4 MeV scale which would dominate the statistical
uncertainties. Nevertheless given the opportunity to improve on the measurement of
the W mass using data collected synergistically with the main ILC physics program
this is an area where further detailed study would be very welcome.

The main subject of this contribution is an update of a previous study on the
measurement of the W mass using a polarized threshold scan [9, 10]. The study
has evolved taking into account additional systematic eﬀects. The updates include
the use of beam parameters consistent with the ILC TDR design and experimental

performance appropriate to the envisaged ILC detectors. The previous study was
started in 1999 and had very conservatively assumed experimental characteristics
similar to the LEP detectors.

Such a measurement would necessarily entail signiﬁcant allocation of running time

to data-taking near
Low statistics measurements at a single center-of-mass energy with unpolarized beams
were done in 1996 by the LEP experiments [11–14] and were reviewed in [15,16]. The
dependence of the cross-section on center-of-mass energy is illustrated in Figure 1.
There are two primary experimental issues at the heart of interpreting a high statistics
threshold scan as a measurement of the W mass. Firstly, one needs excellent control of
the absolute center-of-mass energy, and secondly one needs to be able to control
the background. These are discussed further in the next section.

It has been shown recently [17] that e+e− → µ+µ−(γ) events can be used to make
an in situ measurement of the average center-of-mass energy with high statistical
precision∗ based simply on momentum measurements of the muons as ﬁrst discussed
in [18]. Under the assumption that the recoil mass to the measured muons is zero, an
estimate of the center-of-mass energy of such events can be formed simply from the
measured momenta of the two muons:
sP = E1 + E2 + | (cid:126)p1 + (cid:126)p2| =

µ + | (cid:126)p1 + (cid:126)p2|

2 + m2

(cid:113)

The distribution of this variable can then be used to deduce relevant parameters
including those related to the average absolute center-of-mass energy. Given very
good control of the tracking detector absolute momentum scale†, it is envisaged that
knowledge of the absolute center-of-mass energy at the 10 ppm level can be targeted,
corresponding to a contribution to the W mass uncertainty at threshold of 0.8 MeV.
Our strategy for controlling the background is to measure the background in situ
using polarized beams. Polarized electrons and polarized positrons make it feasible
to measure the background and simultaneously measure the polarization (also in situ).
Having good control of the background is critical. Assuming a background level of
250 fb, a 10% uncertainty on the background amounts to an uncertainty of 12 MeV on
MW for an unpolarized scan. With highly polarized beams, and a 100 fb−1 polarized
scan, the background level can be measured to about 4 fb.

In addition to the need for exclusive running near WW threshold, the polarized
threshold scan is most attractive if the beams are highly polarized, and if suﬃcient
data-sets are collected to pin-down and to monitor the tracker momentum scale which
aﬀects the determination of the absolute center-of-mass energy. At present the most
obvious way to guarantee the latter, is to make sure that the accelerator can also
run eﬀectively at the Z pole yielding high statistics calibration data. In these three
aspects there is a need for the ILC accelerator design to retain compatibility with
good performance at relatively low energy.

∗Previous studies had assumed that the absolute center-of-mass energy would be determined
using the angle technique in Zγ events (with Z → µ+µ−) - a technique that suﬀers from relatively
poor event-by-event statistical precision given the Z width

Polarized Beams

The cross-section dependence on the longitudinal polarization of the electron and
positron beams is given by [20]

σ(Pe−, Pe+) =

1
4

{(1 − Pe−)(1 + Pe+)σLR + (1 + Pe−)(1 − Pe+)σRL +
(1 − Pe−)(1 − Pe+)σLL + (1 + Pe−)(1 + Pe+)σRR}

where σk (k = LR, RL, LL and RR) are the fully polarized cross-sections. In cases
where the LL and RR cross-sections are zero, the resulting cross-section simpliﬁes to

σ(Pe−, Pe+) =

1
4

{(1 − Pe−)(1 + Pe+)σLR + (1 + Pe−)(1 − Pe+)σRL}

which can be rewritten as

σ(Pe−, Pe+) = σu{(1 − Pe− Pe+) − (Pe− − Pe+)ALR}

(1)

where σu is the unpolarized cross-section, (σLR + σRL)/4, and ALR is the left-right
asymmetry deﬁned as

ALR = (σLR − σRL)/(σLR + σRL)

Equation 1 is appropriate for Z production. It is also appropriate for the doubly-
resonant CC03 WW production diagrams, where especially close to threshold, ALR,
is close to maximal‡ given the dominance of the t-channel νe exchange diagram.
For many of the processes, that play the role of a background to WW production,
notably, e+e− → qqgg, it is also highly appropriate. Note that this is not appropriate
for processes such as single W production which is expected to contribute to the
background in the qqeν channel (the LL and RR cross-sections are non-zero in this
case).

With the WW asymmetry of around 0.99, and background asymmetries ranging
from 0.15 to 0.48 (depending on channel), it is feasible to use the polarization of the
beams to preferentially enhance the signal cross-section, and therefore the statistics
for the measurement. Conversely, it is possible to use the polarization to essentially
turn-oﬀ the signal process, and measure events that are much enriched in background.
At ILC, it is expected that the beams can be highly polarized, and the spin
can be ﬂipped with high frequency (certainly pulse-to-pulse for electrons). Electron
polarization is straightforward. Electron polarizations of 80% are in the baseline,
and values as high as 90% can be targeted. The baseline ILC design has polarized

positron beams at beam energies exceeding 125 GeV with a polarization level of 30%,
and there are studies and prospects for positron polarization levels as high as 60%.
Fully worked out designs for high instantaneous luminosity and positron polarization
at low energy are under study. The relative polarization will be monitored with
polarimeters.

Experimentally, we expect to have the freedom to choose appropriate fractions of
the delivered luminosity in the various polarization conﬁgurations. We can imagine
collisions with positive, negative and zero polarization for each beam, resulting in a
total of 9 diﬀerent “helicity conﬁgurations”, namely (−+, +−, −−, ++, 00, 0+, 0−,
+0, −0).

Example Scan

The basic method is to do a counting experiment where the experimental observables
are the number of selected candidate events, Nijk, consistent with WW production in
the diﬀerent decay channels (index i), observed at each center-of-mass energy (index
j) and for each helicity conﬁguration of the polarized electron and positron beams
(index k). The data are sub-divided into the 3 major decay channels (qqqq, qq(cid:96)ν,
(cid:96)ν(cid:96)ν).
In addition to the selected candidate events, we also measure the number
of Z-like e+e− → ff(γ) events produced for each center-of-mass energy and helicity
conﬁguration, N Z
jk, as a means of measuring the polarization in situ. An example
simulated data-set corresponding to a 6-point ILC scan with 4 helicity conﬁgurations,
and correspondingly 96 event counts, is displayed in Table 1.

The observed event counts in the various channels are ﬁtted to the expected event
counts from signal plus background events in a model with ﬁt parameters that account
for the theoretical model parameters and relevant systematic eﬀects. The ﬁts are done
using a Poisson likelihood. The ﬁt parameters are given in Table 2.

in each channel, ε (lvlv), ε (qqlv), ε (qqqq). All four of these uncertainties are con-
strained within speciﬁed uncertainties. The constraint is accomplished by adding a
χ2 penalty contribution.

Parameters 16-19 are used to measure the beam polarization using the Z-like
events in a similar manner to [28]. Using equation 1, we see that with 4 cross-
section measurements, corresponding to, for example, the −+, +−, −−, ++ helicity
conﬁgurations, it is possible to measure these four parameters, namely, σu, ALR,

7

|P (e−)| and |P (e+)|. This assumes that the polarization magnitudes are identical for
positive and negative polarization of the same beam (perfect spin-ﬂip approximation).
If this is not the case, or if this assumption needs to be checked it would be possible
to take additional data with unpolarized beam or beams to further constrain the
polarization model.

The other 9 parameters pertain to the background modeling in each of the 3
s near
channels. The extraction of MW from the cross-section and its dependence on
threshold is sensitive to the understanding of the background. It is expected that the
background contribution needs to be determined from data in a robust way. For each
channel, the parameters, are the background cross-section, σB, the background left-
right asymmetry, AB
LR, and a background shape parameter, βB, allowing for a power-
law center-of-mass energy dependence of the background cross-section according to

Reasonable guesses for the shape parameter βB are in the range [-2,2]. This is expected
to be a reasonable model for the qqqq channel where background issues are a major
concern. Input data-sets use βB = 0.

With polarized beams, there is little need to take data at

s values far from
threshold to measure the background, but there is a need to measure the polarization
and to control the polarization systematics of the background. It is assumed that
the background asymmetries can be constrained with background “side-bands”, and
these parameters are also implemented with a χ2 penalty function. The standard
ﬁts discussed here with both beams polarized only use the ﬁrst six background pa-
rameters. Other cases of interest are with only electron beam polarization, where
one may need to rely more on external measurements of the beam polarization, and
some data-taking below threshold. Especially with no polarization, data-taking be-
low threshold would appear mandatory for background control, but it would also be
s shape dependence of the background, and the βB
important to understand the
parameters have been introduced to start to address this issue.

√

Polarized Threshold Scan Study

The improvements include a re-optimization of the fraction of the luminosity asso-
ciated with each beam helicity conﬁguration which results from the assumed better
detector performance. The updated assumptions on the experimental event selection
and the associated systematics are given in Table 3. These correspond to a factor of
two reduction in the event selection ineﬃciency and a factor of two reduction in the
non-WW backgrounds compared to that essentially achieved with the LEP detectors.

question.

The results from an ensemble of 1000 toy experiments is found to be an overall
uncertainty on MW of 3.94 MeV. An example of one of these ﬁts is shown in Table 4.
In order to assess the eﬀective contribution of the various systematic eﬀects to the
overall W mass error, the ﬁts are then re-run for 6 diﬀerent alternative ﬁts where

the parameters encompassing individual sources of systematic error that are normally
ﬁtted for, are ﬁxed to their correct model values. The standard ﬁt and the 6 variations
lead to 7 estimates of the W mass uncertainty from which the intrinsic statistical error,
the systematics associated with each source of uncertainty, and the total systematic
uncertainty are estimated. Note that since all the parameters are ﬁtted for, the overall
uncertainty including systematics is statistical in nature and can be improved further
with increased integrated luminosity. The results of these 15-parameter ﬁts are shown
in Table 5.

We have also looked into 15-parameter ﬁts with only two scan points such as
illustrated in Table 6. The data at
s = 170 GeV are quite useful for constraining
the normalization parameters of the measurement and is retained. Such ﬁts reach a
smaller overall uncertainty. However they are more model-dependent and do little to
demonstrate qualitatively the kinematic dependence of the cross-section at threshold.
It would seem reasonable to make sure that the data collected would have enough
degrees of freedom to test for example the cross-section dependence on ΓW . The
overall results of these scans are reported in Table 7.

There are a number of issues that have not been treated in much depth including
theoretical uncertainties, background composition, in particular four-fermion eﬀects,
and detailed modeling of event selection performance. However it is thought that the
current treatment is appropriate for the current level of study.

Table 7: Total W mass uncertainty in MeV from polarized scan near threshold

Summary

A threshold scan with polarized electron and positron beams can yield a precision
measurement of MW at ILC. Errors at the few MeV level can be envisaged. With
100 fb−1, and polarization values of (90%, 60%), the estimated uncertainty is

∆MW (MeV) = 2.4 (stat) ⊕ 3.1 (syst) ⊕ 0.8 (

s) ⊕ theory

√

The ILC design can and should evolve to make this feasible. Positron polarization
is extremely helpful in controlling the polarization and background systematics. The
highest polarization values would make such a measurement most impactful. Mea-
surements with no positron polarization or even no electron polarization are obviously
more challenging.

Eventual experimental precision approaching 2 MeV can be considered at ILC if
one is able to dedicate 500 fb−1 to such a measurement, and the physics perspective
of the day demands it. Before embarking on such an extended run near threshold,
one would certainly want to make sure that the center-of-mass energy systematic is
indeed controlled at close to the envisaged level, that the theoretical uncertainties can
be controlled adequately, and that such a program oﬀers suﬃcient complementarity

11

in the determination of the W mass to data already collected at higher center-of-mass
energies synergistic with the main ILC program.
