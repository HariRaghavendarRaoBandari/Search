X-rank and identiﬁability for a polynomial decomposition model

Pierre Comon, Yang Qi, and Konstantin Usevich

firstname.lastname@gipsa-lab.fr

March 7, 2016

Abstract

In this paper, we study a polynomial decomposition model that arises in problems of system identiﬁcation,
signal processing and machine learning. We show that this decomposition is a special case of the X-
rank decomposition — a powerful novel concept in algebraic geometry that generalizes the tensor CP
decomposition. We prove new results on generic/maximal rank and on identiﬁability of the polynomial
decomposition model. In the paper, we try to make results and basic tools accessible for a general audience
(assuming no knowledge of algebraic geometry or its prerequisites).

Introduction: polynomial decompositions

1.1 Model and examples

Let K be R or C. By K≤d[u] we denote the space of multivariate polynomials in m variables of total de-
gree ≤ d. More precisely, consider a multivariate polynomial map f : Km → Kn, i.e., a vector1 f (u) =
, (i.e.,

of multivariate polynomials of total degree ≤ d in variables u =(cid:2)u1

fi ∈ K≤d[u]). We say that f has a decoupled representation, if it can be expressed as

· · · fn(u)(cid:3)⊤

· · · um(cid:3)⊤

(cid:2)f1(u)

(1)
where vk ∈ Km, wk ∈ Kn, and where gk(t) = c1,kt + . . . + cd,ktd are univariate polynomials2. The constant
part w0 is uniquely determined from the constant term of polynomial vector f (u); therefore, from Section 2
onwards we assume that w0 = 0 and the constant parts of the polynomials fk are equal to zero.

1 u) + · · · + wrgr(v⊤

f (u) = w0 + w1g1(v⊤

r u),

The decomposition (1) appears in several models which are described in the next subsections.

= V⊤u, followed by parallel nonlinear transformations gk = gk(tk),

· · · wr(cid:3). Then (1) can be viewed as a linear

as depicted in Figure 1.

Example 1.

(Block-structured models of nonlinear systems)

Let us deﬁne the matrices V =(cid:2)v1
transformation of variables(cid:2)t1
and followed by a linear transformation y = W(cid:2)g1

· · · vr(cid:3), and W =(cid:2)w1
tr(cid:3)⊤
· · · gr(cid:3)⊤

· · ·

The decomposition (1) appears as a subproblem in the ﬁeld of system identiﬁcation. In fact, the goal of
system identiﬁcation is to estimate the parameters of a dynamical system from input and output measurements.
The current big challenge in the ﬁeld is identiﬁcation of nonlinear dynamical systems [HK99], which will help
to provide better models for natural processes and engineering devices [SMP+14].

As shown in a number of recent papers, the decomposition (1) is a key to identiﬁcation of several rich
nonlinear block-structured dynamical systems: parallel Wiener Hammerstein systems (where f represents the
static nonlinear part of a system) [SMP+14, DIS15] and linear fractional model [VVU14] (where the polynomial
f represents the nonlinear feedback).

[DIS15]).

(Independent Component Analysis)

Example 2.
Yet another case of the decomposition (1) comes from source separation problems in signal processing. Consider
a linear mixing model

x = Vs,

(2)

where V ∈ Rn×r is an unknown mixing matrix, and s = (cid:2)s1

is a vector of independent (real or
complex) random variables. Then the cumulant generating function3 h(u) of the random vector x can be
expanded as [LdAC11, Eq.1]:

· · · sr(cid:3)⊤

h(u) = h1(v⊤

1 u) + · · · + hr(v⊤

r u),

(3)

where hk(·) are cumulant generating functions for the source random variables sk. Moreover, if f (u) is a d-th
order Taylor approximation of h at 0 (which includes the information on cumulants up to the order d), then
f has a decomposition4

f (u) = g1(v⊤

1 u) + · · · + gr(v⊤

r u),

(4)

where gk is the d-th order Taylor approximation of hk(·) at 0. It is easy to see that the decomposition (4) is
a special case of (1) (when n = 1).

(Function approximation and ﬂexible neural networks)

Example 3.
First, consider the case n = 1. Then the decomposition (3) is known as sum of so-called ridge functions or plane
waves in the ﬁeld of Approximation Theory. The polynomial case (4), is very important for Approximation
Theory, see [LS75, Osk02].

Moreover, the decomposition (3) can be viewed as a feed-forward neural network (see Fig. 2). In particular,
the decomposition (4) corresponds to the case of ridge polynomial neural networks [SG95] (RPNs). RPNs have
found many applications in machine learning (classiﬁcation) and time series analysis. The advantage of RPNs
is that the nonlinearities are ﬂexible, as opposed to ﬁxed, e.g. sigmoid, which are nonlinearities commonly used
in that ﬁeld [HSW89]. For n > 1 (see Fig. 1), the decomposition (1) can be seen as a multilayer generalization
of RPN.

3The cumulant generating function diﬀers from the second characteristic function only by the absence of the pure imaginary

coeﬃcient [Luk60].

4The connection between ICA and (4) is also described in Section 7.

1.2 Previous work and goals

Due to a practical interest in system identiﬁcation (see Example 1), algorithms for the decomposition (1) were
recently developed for the case n > 1 [DIS15], [VVU14]. The main idea is to build from f (u) a structured
tensor T (f ) of size n × m × N (where N is large) such that the rank of the tensor is equal to the number of
terms in (1). The approach has been shown eﬀective for small ranks. For n = 1, a heuristic algorithm was
proposed in [Use14], based on the ideas of [BCMT10].

In this paper, we focus on the theoretical properties of decompositions (1) and (4):

1. Rank properties:

• What is the maximal rank, i.e. the number of terms in (1) needed to represent any polynomial

vector f (u)?

• What are the typical ranks, i.e. the number of terms in (1) needed to represent almost all f (u)?

2. Identiﬁability: what can we say about uniqueness of the representation (1)?

Maximal ranks The ﬁrst (and probably the only) works on the properties of decomposition (4) (a special
case of (1) corresponding to n = 1) are the papers [Sch02a], [Sch02b], and [BBS08]. In particular, the authors
of [BBS08] show that the maximal number of terms is bounded by

rmax ≤(cid:18)m + d − 2
d − 1 (cid:19).

(5)

Typical/generic ranks As for the typical ranks, from [AGMO16] or [CQU15] it follows that in the case
K = C the random polynomial vector f (u) has with probability 1 the same number of terms (denoted by rgen,
or generic rank )5. The value of rgen is known only for m = 2 and the formula is given in [Sch02a].

Uniqueness The uniqueness of representation (1) was almost not studied. The authors of [DIS15] suggested
some uniqueness conditions based on the well-known Kruskal condition for the tensor T (f ). Moreover, the
authors claim (citing the results of [De 06]) that the model (1) is generically unique whenever

(m − 1)m(n − 1)n ≥ 2(r − 1)r.

(6)

In fact, this claim is not completely rigorous, since the set of structured tensors is non-generic in the bigger
space of unstructured tensors, and therefore the bound (6) cannot be directly applied6.

In this paper we:

1. Provide new upper bounds on rgen for the general case (when m > 2).

2. Using the upper bound on rgen, we obtain a bound on rmax (for K = R or C) that is better than (5).

3. We obtain rigorous results on the generic uniqueness, which yield a bound that is better than (6), or

than any other possible bound based on identiﬁability results for unstructured tensors.

5As shown in [BT15], rgen also coincides with the smallest typical rank in the case K = R
6Take for instance the simple case of symmetry. The maximal symmetric rank Ro

s for which symmetric tensors will have a
unique CP decomposition is smaller [COV15] than the maximal rank Ro for which unconstrained tensors will have a unique CP
decomposition [CBDC09, COV14].

2 Summary of the main results

In this paper, we consider (1) as a special case of X-rank decomposition, and study the properties of X-rank
decomposition for the case of Veronese scrolls (which is, in fact, more general than (1)). We prefer, however,
to give in this section a formal summary of the properties of (1) in simple terms, in order to make the results
of this paper available for a wider audience. More general results will be presented in sections 4, 5 and 6.

2.1 Basic deﬁnitions

In order to formulate the results, we need a simplistic deﬁnition of an aﬃne algebraic variety (in the style of
[CLO97]).

Deﬁnition 1 A subset V ⊆ CN is called an (aﬃne) algebraic variety if it is a zero set of a system of
polynomial equations. We say that V is a proper subvariety (of CN ) if it does not coincide with CN .

We say that some property holds generically in CN if there exists a proper subvariety V ( CN such that

the property is true at least7 in CN \ V .

Since any proper algebraic subvariety has Lebesgue measure zero, we have the following remark.

Remark 1 If the property holds generically, it implies that a random vector (drawn from any absolutely
continuous distribution) from CN satisﬁes the given property with probability 1.

2.2 Generic and maximal ranks

As we said previously, the following lemma holds true.

Lemma 2 Let K = C, and ﬁx m, n and d. Then the minimal number of terms in decomposition (4) is equal
(generically) to a number rgen = rgen(m, n, d).

Proposition 3 Let K = C, n = 1, and ﬁx m, d such that d ≥ 4 and m > (d − 2)(d − 1). Then it holds that



We shall see later that this proposition is a consequence of Prop. 30, which we prove in Section 6.

As a corollary of Proposition 3 (by the results of [BT15]), we obtain the following bound on rmax.

Corollary 4 Let K = C or R, n = 1, and ﬁx m and d such that d ≥ 4 and m > (d − 2)(d − 1). Then the
maximal rank is bounded by

The bound in Corollary 4 implies that

rmax ≤ 2&(cid:0)m+d−2

d−1 (cid:1) +(cid:0)m+d−1

m

where the right inequality holds due to the fact that m > (d − 2)(d − 1). Hence, the bound (8) is better than
(5) if m > 8, and the ratio between the bounds (8) and (5) approaches 2

d asymptotically as m → ∞.

7In fact, the sets CN \ V form the base of the open sets in the so-called Zariski topology.

2.3 Trivial indeterminacies and uniqueness of decomposition

As we said previously, we omit the constant terms (i.e., we assume w0 = 0 and f (0) = 0). In the decomposition

(1), denote ck =(cid:2)c1,k

cd,k(cid:3)⊤

· · ·

(the vector of coeﬃcients of polynomial gk(t) = c1,kt + . . . + cd,ktd).

In order to deﬁne the notion of uniqueness, we consider some trivial indeterminacies. First, it is easy to see
that permuting the terms in (1) does not change the decomposition (we will call it permutation indeterminacy).
1 u). Indeed, let (v1, w1, c1) ∈ Cm+n+d. Then for any
Second, we can rescale each elementary term w1g1(v⊤
α, β 6= 0 and (v2, w2, c2) ∈ Cm+n+d deﬁned as

v1 = αv2,
w1 = βw2,

cd,1(cid:3) =

we have that

w1g1(v⊤

1 u) = w2g2(v⊤

2 u)

We will call the permutation and scaling intereminacies trivial. These indeterminacies are not taken into
account when we talk about uniqueness.

Deﬁnition 2 We say that f (u) has a unique decomposition (1), if the vector

((v1, w1, c1), . . . , (vr, wr, cr)) ∈ C(m+n+d)r

(9)

satisfying (1) is deﬁned uniquely up to trivial indeterminacies.

Deﬁnition 3 The decomposition (1) with r terms is called generically unique (or r-identiﬁable) if the unique-
ness of the decomposition holds generically in C(m+n+d)r.

Remark 5 Generic uniqueness implies that for a random polynomial with decomposition (1) (drawn from
any absolutely continuous distribution), the decomposition will be unique with probability 1.

2.4 Generic uniqueness (full identiﬁability)

First, we denote

1. The model (1) is r-identiﬁable if

r ≤ min(m, ⌈r2(m, n, d)⌉ − 1) · n.

(12)

In particular, if m < r2(m, n, d), then the model (1) is mn-identiﬁable.

2. The model (1) cannot be r-identiﬁable for r > mn.

We begin with providing some examples. In Tables 1 and 3, we provide the calculated bound on identiﬁa-
bility (12). For comparison, we show the maximal non-defective rank obtained numerically using Terracini’s
lemma in Tables 2 and 4.

Remark 7 Nondefectivity guarantees only existence of a ﬁnite number of decompositions. We also applied
the criterion of weak tangential nondefectivity described in [COV14], and checked that the non-defective ranks
shown in Table 2 are identiﬁable, except the cases of rank mn. For some reason, the maximal identiﬁable rank
that could be checked with the criterion of [COV14] is mn − 1.

In all tables, the cases when the rank coincides with mn (i.e., the maximal possible rank by Proposition 6,

part 2) are shown in bold.

As it is easy to see from Tables 1–4, that the bound given by (12) is rather good, especially for m ≥ n.
The numerical results suggest, however, that the bound can be improved. Nevertheless, since the numerator
of (10) for m > 1 is a strictly increasing function in d, we have the following corollary.

Corollary 8 For ﬁxed m and n, there exists d0 such that the inequality m < r2(m, n, d) holds for all d ≥ d0.

Next, we take d ≥ 4 and m ≥ n > 1, m ≥ 5. Then we have that

r2(m, n, d)

m

r2(m, n, 4)

(m + 1)(m + 2)(m + 3)

> 1,

In fact, from Table 3, r2(m, n, d) > m also for 5 ≥ m ≥ n ≥ 4. Hence, the following corollary takes place.

Corollary 9 The inequality m < r2(m, n, d) holds for all m ≥ n ≥ 4 and d ≥ 4.

From Corollaries 8 and 9, the model (1) is mn-identiﬁable in many cases8. This bound is better than
the heuristic bound (6) (see also Table 5), and better than the best bound for identiﬁability of unstructured
tensors, which may not exceed (m − 1)(n − 1) for n × m × N unbalanced tensors [COV14].

Finally, in Table 6 we give maximal non-defective ranks that can be obtained by using only the degree-2
information (d = 2). These results imply that for degree 2 the identiﬁability is possible only for very low
ranks. Also it shows that the heuristic bound in (6) is not valid for degree 2.

8In fact, the numerical results in Table 2 suggest that the model is mn-identiﬁable for d ≥ 3 and m ≥ n ≥ 4. However, the

bound in Proposition 6 is too weak to handle the case d = 3.

2.5 Partial identiﬁability

By Proposition 6, the decomposition (1) is not r-identiﬁable for r > mn, since we can never recover the linear
terms c1,k of polynomials gk(t). However, the higher order terms may be still recovered uniquely.

Deﬁnition 4 We say that the polynomial vector f (u) has unique decomposition (1) down to degree s if for

3 X-rank and identiﬁability

The concept of X-rank (or rank with respect to a variety) was probably ﬁrst proposed in [Zak04], and
popularized in [BT15, Lan12]. In these papers (and in algebraic geometry in general) it is customary to work
with projective varieties in projective spaces. We will postpone the use of this language to Section 3.4, in
order to make the deﬁnitions accessible to a wider audience.

3.1 X-rank: deﬁnitions

Consider an N -dimensional vector space A over K, where K is R or C. For simplicity, we can assume that

that satisﬁes the following conditions.

A = KN (more precisely, A is isomorphic to KN ). Assume that a subset bX ⊂ A of rank-one elements is ﬁxed
1. bX is a (doubly inﬁnite) cone (v ∈ bX and α ∈ K implies αv ∈ bX);
2. bX is non-degenerate (it is not contained in any hyperplane of A, that is, span(bX) = A);
3. bX is an aﬃne algebraic variety [CLO97] (bX is the zero set of a system of polynomial equations).

Then the X-rank of a vector v ∈ A is deﬁned as the smallest number of rank-one elements, such that v can
be represented as their sum:

rankX (v) = min r : v = x1 + · · · + xr, xk ∈ bX.

(13)

The rank of 0 ∈ A, by convention, is zero. Such a decomposition is called an X-rank decomposition.

Condition 1 guarantees that the X-rank is compatible with linear operations, whereas condition 2 ensures
that any vector has an X-rank decomposition and that the X-rank does not exceed N . The structural
condition 3 is important for algebraic analysis of X-rank decompositions.

To avoid pathological phenomena and also for convenience of using algebraic geometry, we usually require

that bX is an irreducible9 variety.

3.2 Secant varieties and identiﬁability

First, we recall the basic deﬁnitions. We deﬁne the addition map Σr : (A)r → A

Σr(x1, · · · , xr) = x1 + · · · + xr,

and for an aﬃne cone bX ⊂ A, we deﬁne by

the set of vectors in A with rank ≤ r. Next, we introduce the Zariski closure

Σr, bX

def= Σr(bX, . . . , bX)
bσr(bX) = Σr, bX ⊂ A,

which is, by deﬁnition, the smallest aﬃne algebraic variety that contains Σr, bX.

Deﬁnition 6 A variety bX ⊂ A is called r-identiﬁable if the set of p ∈ Σr, bX that have a unique X-rank
decomposition contains a Zariski-open subset of bσr(bX).
Remark 11 In the case K = C, and also if bX is an irreducible variety, then r-identiﬁability implies that the

set of non-identiﬁable rank-r decompositions has Lebesgue measure zero.

9 bX is called irreducible [CLO97] if for any decomposition as a union of varieties bX = bY ∪ bZ, it must hold that either bY ⊆ bZ

or bZ ⊆ bY .

9

3.3 Polynomial decomposition as X-ranks

It is easy to show that decomposition (1) can be viewed as a special case of (13), as pointed out below. In
what follows, we will omit the constant terms in decomposition (1). Let K[1;d][z] denote the set of polynomials
of degree ≤ d with a zero constant term.

1. Rank-one polynomials: take A = K[1;d][z] and

def
= {f ∈ A | f (z) = g(v⊤z), g(t) =

dXj=1

bX(1,...,d)

cjtj, v ∈ Km, ck ∈ K}.

(14)

2. Rank-one polynomial maps: take A = K[1;d][z] × · · · × K[1;d][z] and

cjtj, v ∈ Km, w ∈ Kn}.

(15)

bY(1,...,d)

def
= {f ∈ A | f (z) = wg(v⊤z), g(t) =

dXj=1
It is clear that bX(1,...,d) and bY(1,...,d) are nondegenerate cones.

It is left to prove that they are aﬃne
algebraic varieties (equivalently, that the corresponding projective sets X(1,...,d) and Y(1,...,d) are projective
varieties). This will be shown in Section 4.

3.4 Projective varieties

In the previous sections we avoided as the use of projective spaces and projective varieties. In this section, we
formulate the deﬁnition in these terms, classically used in algebraic geometry.

Consider the projective space PA, which is the topological space of 1-dimensional subspaces of A. More
precisely, PA is deﬁned as the space (A \ {0})/∼ of equivalence classes with respect to multiplication by a

nonzero number from K. Since bX is a cone, bX can be associated with a subset X of the projective space PA.
In this case, X is a projective variety [CLO97, Ch. 8], and bX is called an aﬃne cone of X .

Let PΣr, bX be projectivization of Σr, bX. Then we introduce the Zariski closure

σr(X ) = PΣr, bX ⊂ PA,

where the latter is called the r-th secant variety of X . We will also often use the notationbσr(X ) (resp. Σr,X )
instead ofbσr(bX) (resp. Σr, bX).

Deﬁnition 7 For a variety Y we say that a property is general if it holds in almost all points of Y except for
a proper subvariety of Y.

Next, we have that a general element [p] ∈ σr(X ) can be written as

[p] = [x1 + · · · + xr].

(16)

Deﬁnition 8 A projective variety X ⊂ PA is called r-identiﬁable [CO12] if a general [p] ∈ σr(X ) has a unique
decomposition (16). (In other words, the set of [p] of the form (16) contains a Zariski-open subset of σr(X ).)

Deﬁnition 9 A variety X ⊂ PA is called not r-weakly defective if for r general points in X a general hyper-
plane tangent to them is not tangent to X elsewhere [CC02].

If X is not r-weakly defective, then X is r-identiﬁable (the converse is not true).

Deﬁnition 10 In the case K = C, the smallest r such that σr(X ) = PA, is called the generic rank and denoted
by rgen(X ).

10

4 Veronese scrolls

In this section, we introduce a variety that we call Veronese k-fold scroll (or Veronese scroll) that is a gener-
alization of a classic object in algebraic geometry, namely the rational normal scroll [CJ96]. We will see that
the variety X(1,...,d) is a special case of the Veronese scroll.

This section and the next one were initially planned to describe the properties of X(1,...,d) and Y(1,...,d), but
after reading the recent article [AGMO16], we realized that the same proofs can be used for the general case
of Veronese scrolls.

4.1 Parametric description

For an m-dimensional vector space V over K we denote by SdV the space of symmetric tensors10 of order d.
Let 0 ≤ a1 ≤ · · · ≤ ad be a sequence of natural numbers11 put in one vector a = (a1, . . . , ad) ∈ Nd and deﬁne
a shorthand notation

which is a vector space of dimension

SaV

def
= Sa1V ⊕ Sa2V ⊕ · · · ⊕ SadV,

dim(SaV ) =

dXk=1(cid:18)m + ak − 1
(cid:19).

ak

Next, we deﬁne the following map:

ψ : V × Kd → SaV

(v, (c1, · · · , cd))

7→ (c1va1 , c2va2 , . . . , cdvad ),

and deﬁne the image of this map as

(17)

(18)

and Xa = Xa,V ⊂ PSaV the corresponding subset in the projective space (as we will show later, it is a
projective variety).

def
= ψ(V × Kd),

bXa = bXa,V

Remark 12 For dim(V ) = m = 2, Xa,V is the rational normal (d-fold) scroll, a classic object in algebraic
geometry. For general V , we call Xa,V a Veronese scroll (since it is constructed as a join of Veronese varieties).
As we will show later, Xa,V is a projective variety.

We say that f = (f1, . . . , fd) ∈ SaV has a Waring-like decomposition of rank r if there exist v1, . . . , vr

and ck,l ∈ K such that

f1 = c1,1va1

1 + · · · + c1,rva1
r ,

...

fd = cd,1vad

1 + · · · + cd,rvad
r .

(19)

(20)

(21)

It is easy to see that f has a Waring-like decomposition if and only if it has an X-rank decomposition with
X = Xa,V .
Finally,

it is easy to see that bX(1,...,d) deﬁned in (14) is isomorphic to the aﬃne cone bX(1,...,d),V de-

ﬁned in (18) with a = (1, . . . , d) (the same holds for the corresponding projective set X(1,...,d)). Moreover
Y(1,...,d) ≃ Seg(X(1,...,d) × PW ), where W is an n-dimensional vector space over K. Therefore, the polynomial
decomposition (1) is equivalent to the X-rank decomposition for X = Y(1,...,d).

In what follows, for convenience, in the case n = 1 we assume Y(1,...,d) = X(1,...,d).

10If V is isomorphic to Km, then SdV is isomorphic to the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree d.
11By convention, N is the set of nonnegative integers.

11

4.2 Determinantal construction (deﬁning equations)

Next, we show that the set bXa,V is given by the vanishing of all 2 × 2 minors of a structured matrix. This will

automatically prove that Xa,V is a projective variety12, and moreover that it is is irreducible.

First, recall a deﬁnition of the catalecticant matrix [IK99, Ch. 1] (we prefer giving it in coordinates). For

a multi-index13 α = (α1, . . . , αm) ∈ Nm, we denote |α| = α1 + · · · + αm, and by

the multinomial coeﬃcient. Let f ∈ SdV be a homogeneous polynomial given in the basis of multinomial
coeﬃcients

|α|

α1! · · · αm!

=

(cid:18)|α|
α(cid:19) def
f (z) = Xα∈∆d,m(cid:18)|α|

α(cid:19)fαzα

where α = (α1, . . . , αm) and ∆s,m
deﬁned as a matrix14 with rows and columns indexed by multi-indices

def= {α ∈ Nm : |α| = s}. Then the catalecticant matrix, for 1 ≤ s ≤ d, is

In fact, we will need just the ﬁrst catalecticant matrix.

Cf,s,d−s

def
= [fα+β]α∈∆s,m,β∈∆d−s,m.

Proposition 13 Let f = (f1, . . . , fd) ∈ SaV , such that all ak ≥ 1. Deﬁne the stacked catalecticant matrix as

S(f ) def= (cid:2) Cf1,1,a1−1
· · · Cfd,1,ad−1 (cid:3) .
f ∈ bXa,V ⇐⇒ rank{S(f )} ≤ 1.

Then the set bXa,V is deﬁned (set-theoretically) by the vanishing of all 2 × 2 minors of S(f ). More precisely:

Proof: ⇒ This direction is evident. In this case (f1, . . . , fd) = (c1va1 , . . . , cdvad). Since each fk is rank-one,
by [IK99, Thm. 1.28] each catalecticant matrix Cf1,1,ak−1 has rank ≤ 1. Moreover the column space of each
rank-one Cf1,1,ak−1 is spanned by the vector v, therefore the column space of S(f ) is spanned by v, and its
rank does not exceed 1.

⇐ Now consider S(f ) with rank 1 (the case of rank 0 is obvious). Deﬁne as v the vector that spans the
column space of S(f ). Since each of the matrices Cf1,1,ak−1 has rank ≤ 1 by restriction, from [IK99, Thm.
1.28] we have that f = (f1, . . . , fd) = (c1va1
d ). But, from the apolarity [IK99, Ch. 1], [ER93], all
(cid:3)

1 , . . . , cdvad

the vectors vk must be collinear to v. Therefore f ∈ bXa,V .
Corollary 14 Since bXa,V = ψ(V × Kd) is the image of an irreducible variety, it is also irreducible.

Remark 15 A similar construction for the matrix S(f ) can be found in [AGMO16, §3].

Remark 16 In order to show that Xa,V is a projective variety, we could, alternatively, use the classic bundle
construction [AGMO16]. (In [CQU15], a slightly diﬀerent construction was used.) More precisely, Xa,V can
be realized as:

Xa,V ≃ P(OPV (a1) ⊕ · · · ⊕ OPV (ad)).

We do not give any details here, and invite an interested reader can consult [AGMO16] or [CJ96].

stronger than Proposition 13).

We will show in the next subsection, that the 2 × 2 minors of S(f ) generate the ideal of bXa,V (which is

12This will give the (set-theoretic) deﬁning equations of Xa,V .
13By convention, the set N includes 0.
14In fact, this is the matrix representation map Sd−sV ∗ → SsV ∗ given by diﬀerentiation.

12

4.3 Generators of the ideal of the rank-one variety

Since Xa,V is invariant under GL(V ), then Ik(σr(Xa,V )) is a representation of GL(V ). Due to the following
decomposition for dim V ≥ 2 [Lan12],

Sl1(Sa1 V ) ⊗ · · · ⊗ Sld(SadV )

Sk(Sa1V ⊕ · · · ⊕ SadV ) = Ml1+···+ld=k
=M Sπ1V ⊗ · · · ⊗ SπdV
=M SµV,

where SπV denotes the irreducible representation of GL(V ) associated to the partition π, and the sums in

the last two formulas are taken over some subsets of partitions. Therefore, Ik(σr(Xa,V )) =L SµV for some

partitions µ. Similar to [Lan12, Section 7.4] we have

Proposition 17 Given vector spaces V, W with r ≤ dim V ≤ dim W and dim V ≥ 2, then SπV ⊂ Ik(σr(Xa,V ))
if and only if SπW ⊂ Ik(σr(Xa,W )).

Proof: Give a basis {v1, . . . , vdim V } for V , and a basis {w1, . . . , wdim W } for W . Deﬁne an embedding
i : V ֒→ W such that i(vj) = wj for 1 ≤ j ≤ dim V . Then

for any π with length ℓ(π) ≤ dim V . This embedding induces an embedding

SπW = GL(W ) · SπV

So in Sk(Sa1 W ⊕ · · · ⊕ SadW ), we have Ik(σr(Xa,W )) ⊂ Ik(i(σr(Xa,V ))).

σr(Xa,V )

i
֒−→ σr(Xa,W ).

Now we need to show for any SµW = GL(W ) · SµV ⊂ Ik(σr(Xa,V )), SµW ⊂ Ik(σr(Xa,W )). First we
consider the case ℓ(µ) ≤ dim V . Suppose there were some f ∈ SµW , and some point p ∈ σr(Xa,W ), such that
f (p) 6= 0. Since any point in σr(Xa,W ) is the limit of a sequence of rank-r points, without loss of generality,
we may check if f (p) = 0 only for rank-r points. Assume p = [c1,1ua1
r , . . . , cd,ruad
r ],
then there is some g ∈ GL(W ), such that g · span(u1, . . . , ur) ⊂ V , hence g · p ∈ σr(Xa,V ). This implies

1 ] + · · · + [c1,rua1

1 , . . . , cd,1uad

f (p) = f (g−1 · g · p) = (g−1 · f )(g · p) = 0

due to g−1 · f ∈ Ik(σr(Xa,V )), which contradicts the assumption f (p) 6= 0.

Now we consider the case ℓ(µ) > dim V . Then SµV = 0, and SµW is always in the ideal of σr(Xa,V ). For

any p ∈ σr(Xa,W ), there is some g ∈ GL(W ), such that g · p ∈ σr(Xa,V ), which implies for any f ∈ SµW ,

f (p) = f (g−1 · g · p) = (g−1 · f )(g · p) = 0,

i.e., f ∈ Ik(σr(Xa,W )).

As a corollary of Proposition 17 we have

Proposition 18 Given a vector space V with 2 ≤ dim V , then

(cid:3)

SπV ⊂ Ik(Xa,V ) ⇐⇒ SπV ⊂ Ik(Xa,C2).

Since the ideal of the Xa,C2 is generated by 2 × 2 minors of S(f ) [Eis88], we have the following.

Corollary 19 The ideal of the Xa,V , for dim V ≥ 2, is generated by 2 × 2 minors of S(f ).

5 Secant varieties of Veronese scrolls

Throughout this section we assume that K = C. We will also use a shorthand Xa instead of Xa,V .

5.1

Identiﬁability of Segre and Segre-Veronese varieties

In this subsection, we recall some results on k-weak defectivity of Veronese varieties, and we prove a corollary
on identiﬁability of certain Segre-Veronese varieties which we will use in the following sections.

First, we note that

r1(m, 1, d) = (cid:0)m+d−1
(cid:1)m

d

,

such that ⌈r1(m, 1, d)⌉ is the expected generic rank νd(PV ), which is equal to the actual generic rank except
for a few cases. Moreover, the following identiﬁability results was recently proved.

Theorem 20 ([COV15, Theorem 1.1]) Let d ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2. Then νd(PV ) is r-identiﬁable for all r <
r2(m, 1, d), where r2 is deﬁned in (11).

Next, we would like to treat the case n > 1. In order to do this, we invoke results on r-weak defectivity of
Veronese varieties. We deﬁne

r3(m, d) =

Then the following theorem holds.

(m, d) ∈ {(4, 4), (6, 3)},

r1(m, 1, d) − 1,
r1(m, 1, d) − m−2
r1(m, 1, d),

3 , d = 3,

otherwise.

Theorem 21 ([Bal05, Mel06, CC06]) For d ≥ 3 and m ≥ 2, and r < r3(m, d), the Veronese variety
νd(PV ) is not r-weakly defective15.

In order to get results on identiﬁability of some Segre-Veronese varieties, we use a lemma that is a weaker
version of the general result from [BCO14].

Lemma 22 (Corollary of [BCO14, Lemma 3.1, Corollary 3.3].) Let X ⊂ PA is a smooth non-degenerate
projective variety, and W be a vector space. Let Y = Seg(X × PW ) be the Segre embedding (such that
dim(Y) = dim(X ) + dim(W ) − 1). If X is not k-weakly defective, and

k(dim(Y) + 1) < dim(A),

then Y is (k · dim(W ))-identiﬁable.

From Lemma 22 and Theorems 20 and 21, we conclude the following.

Lemma 23 Let m = dim V ≥ 2, d ≥ 3, n = dim W ≥ 1, and k ∈ N be such that

k < r2(m, n, d),

(22)

(23)

where r2(m, n, d) is deﬁned in (11). Then the variety Y(d) (which is equal to Seg(νd(PV ) × PW ) for n > 1
and to νd(PV ) for n = 1) is kn-identiﬁable.

Proof: For the case n = 1, this is just Theorem 20. Now we consider n > 1, and check the conditions of
Lemma 22. In this case, the condition (22) is equivalent to r < r1(m, n, d). We conclude the proof by noting
that ⌈r2(m, n, d)⌉ = ⌈min(r1(m, n, d), r3(m, d))⌉.
(cid:3)

15The case 2 ≤ m ≤ 3 was proved in the proof of [CC06, Thm 5.1], d = 3 was proved in [Mel06, Thm. 4.1], the case d ≥ 4 is

proved in [Bal05, Thm. 1.1.] (see also [Mel06, Corollary 4.5]).

14

5.2

Identiﬁability of Veronese scrolls

Next, we consider a special case of the Veronese scroll.

Proposition 24 Let m = dim V ≥ 2, ad ≥ 3, n = dim W ≥ 1. Next, consider the Veronese scroll X(a1,...,ad)
with a = (a1, . . . , ad), 1 ≤ a1 ≤ · · · ≤ ad, and the variety Y = Y(a1,...,ad). Then we have the following.

1. If k = min(⌈r2(m, n, ad)⌉ − 1, dim Sa1V ) then Y is kn-identiﬁable.

2. The Y cannot be r-identiﬁable for r > n dim(Sa1V ).

Proof:

1. We have that

SaV ⊗ W ≃ (Sa1V ⊗ W ) ⊕ · · · ⊕ (SadV ⊗ W ),

and consider the j-th canonical projection πj : SaV ⊗ W → Saj V ⊗ W . Let r = kn.
First, we note that for any set Y ⊆ SaV ⊗ W , there is the following obvious identity for Zariski closures
of projections

πd(Y ) = πd(Y ).

(24)

Hence, for Z

and by the closure theorem [CLO97, Chapter 3, Theorem 3], πd(bσr(Y)) is Zariski-dense in bσr(Z). This

Next, a general element byl ∈ bY has the form

linearly independent. The lower coeﬃcients ck,l should satisfy the equation

l ⊗ wl}r

l=1 are

1 ⊗ w1 + · · · + ck,rvak

r ⊗ wr,

(25)

and due to linear independence, r ≤ dim(Sa1V ) ≤ dim(Sak V ), we have that ck,l are determined uniquely.

2. Again, look at (25) for k = 1. We have that any system {va1

l ⊗ wl}r

l=1 is linearly dependent due to the

fact that r > dim(Sa1 V )n. Therefore, Y(a1,...,ad) cannot be r-identiﬁable.

5.3 Dimensions of secant varieties for small ranks

From Proposition 6 we can immediately ﬁnd dimensions of secant varieties for small ranks.

Proposition 25 Let m = dim V ≥ 2, ad ≥ 3, n = dim W ≥ 1. Next, consider the Veronese scroll X(a1,...,ad)
with a = (a1, . . . , ad), 1 ≤ a1 ≤ · · · ≤ ad, and the variety Y = Y(a1,...,ad). Furthermore, we assume that

We will say in this case that the rank is “small”. Then we have that:

1. If r ≤ n dim Sa1 V , then

r ≤ (⌈r2(m, n, ad)⌉ − 1)n

2. If

then

n dim SasV < r ≤ n dim Sas+1V,

dimbσr(Y) = r(m + n + d − 2) = exp dimbσr(Y),
dim Saj V

dimbσr(Y) = r(m + n + d − 2 − s) + n
sXj=1

= exp dimbσr(Y(as+1,...,ad)) + dim(cid:16)S(a1,...,as)V ⊗ W(cid:17) ,

Proof:

In the above formulae, exp dimbσr(X ) def= r dim(bX) denotes the expected dimension of a secant variety.
1. By Proposition 24, if r ≤ n dim Sa1V , then dimbσr(Y) is identiﬁable and thus nondefective.

2. In order to prove this, we will prove instead that if (26) holds, then

def
= Y(as+1,...,ad), which would imply the desired result.

Let π = π(s,...,d) : S(a1,...,ad)V ⊗ W → S(as+1,...,ad)V ⊗ W denote the canonical projection i.e.,

bσr(Z) = π(bσr(Y)),

where π(bσr(Y)) is Zariski-dense inbσr(Z) by the closure theorem [CLO97, Chapter 3, Theorem 3].
Next, as in Proposition 24, there exists a Zariski-open subset of U ⊂ π(bσr(Y)) such that any bu ∈ U has
the decomposition bu =bu1 + · · · +bur, where
bul = (cs+1,lvas+1
and vl ⊗ wl are in general position. Therefore, for any bp ∈ S(a1,...,ad)V with π(bp) =bu and all k ≤ s, the

equation (25) is always solvable. Thus we have that

and, moreover,

which implies (27).

π−1(U ) = (S(a1,...,as)V ⊗ W ) × U ⊂bσr(Y),
bσr(Y) = π−1(U ) = (S(a1,...,as)V ⊗ W ) × U ,

16

It may be easier to look at the dimensions in terms of so-called defects. For a variety Y, we deﬁne

(cid:3)

δr(Y) def= exp dimbσr(Y) − dimbσr(Y),

where δr(Y) is called the defect ofbσr(Y). Then Proposition 25 can be reformulated as follows.

Proposition 26 (Proposition 25 reformulated.) Under the assumptions of Proposition 25 (for “small”
ranks), the defect can the expressed as

δr(Y) =

dXj=1

max(r − n dim Saj V, 0).

5.4 Corollaries for Y(1,...,d)

The results in this section follow from the general results on Veronese scrolls. Propositions 6 and 10 basically
follow from Proposition 24 if we specialize them to a = (k, . . . , d). The only additional remark to make is the
following.

Remark 27 The r-identiﬁability in the sense of Deﬁnition 6 implies r-identiﬁability in the sense of Deﬁni-
tion 3. Indeed, since the map that relates the vector (9) to f (u) (an element of S(1,...,d)V ) is a polynomial
map, and is continuous in the Zariski topology. Therefore, if Xa is r-identiﬁable, then by continuity, the
decomposition (1) is identiﬁable in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.

From the above remark, the proofs follow immediately.

Proof:
follows from Proposition 24.

(Proof of Proposition 6) Take a = (1, . . . , d). Then, since dim S1V = m, the proposition immediately
(cid:3)

Proof:
(Proof of Proposition 10) We again take a = (1, . . . , d) and note that by Proposition 24, the variety
Z = Y(s,...,d) is r-identiﬁable. Next, take π = π(s,...,d) as in the proof of Proposition 25, and we have that
(cid:3)
Next, from Proposition 25 we can deduce the dimensions of the secant varieties of Y(1,...,d) through the

π(bσr(Y)) is Zariski-dense inbσr(Z), which implies Proposition 10.

• when 1 ≤ r ≤ mn, and dimbσr(Y(1,...,d)) = r(m + n + d − 2).
• when mn ≤ r ≤ dim S2V ⊗ W , dimbσr(Y(1,...,d)) = r(m + n + d − 2) − (r − mn).
• when dim SkV ⊗ W ≤ r ≤ n(⌈r2(m, n, d)⌉ − 1), dimbσr(Y(1,...,d)) = r(m + n + d − 2) − (r − mn) − · · · −

(r − dim SkV ⊗ W ).

6 Generic ranks

In this section, we consider the case n = 1. From Corollary 28, it follows that the behaviour of the ranks
of secant varieties depend only on higher degrees. As shown by the next lemma, for ﬁxed d and large m
everything depends on two higher degrees. In fact, the case of small d and large m is the most interesting case
for practitioners (in the applications that we discussed in Section 1).

Lemma 29 Let d ≥ 3.

1. For all m ≥ 2,

2. For all m > (d − 2)(d − 1) it holds

r1(m, 1, d) < dim Sd−1V.

dim Sd−2V < r1(m, 1, d).

Proof:

1. First, we note that for d ≥ 2 an m ≥ 2

m + d − 1 < md.

Therefore,

(cid:1)m
r1(m, 1, d) = (cid:0)m+d−1

d

2. As in the previous item, we have that

=(cid:18)m + d − 2

d − 1 (cid:19) m + d − 1

md

<(cid:18)m + d − 2
d − 1 (cid:19).

The ratio is greater than one if

(m + d − 2)(m + d − 1)

m(d − 1)d

.

r1(m, 1, d)

d−2 (cid:1) =
(cid:0)m+d−3

(m + d − 2)(m + d − 1) > m(d − 1)d.

Easy calculations show that for m ≥ 2 the above inequality holds if

m > (d − 2)(d − 1).

From the previous lemma we have that for ﬁxed d for high enough m, we have

(cid:3)

rgen(X(1,...,d)) = rgen(X(d−1,d)).

Thus, everything depends only on the two highest degrees. The next proposition proves some bounds on the
generic rank in this case.

Proposition 30 Let d ≥ 4 and m > 5. Then

Let πd−1 : Sd−1V ⊕ SdV → Sd−1V be the natural projection, and likewise for πd. Then r ≥ rgen(X (d−1,d)) if
and only if

for a general p ∈ SdV . Since

dim πd−1(π−1

d (p) ∩ Im Σr) = dim Sd−1V

dim πd−1(π−1

d (p) ∩ Im Σr) = dim Im(Σr) − dim SdV ≤ dim(bX(d−1,d))×r − dim SdV,

Remark 31 Numerical experiments suggest that the lower bound in Proposition 30 is attained in most cases.
We conjecture that this is true ( i.e., X(d−1,d) is not rgen-defective) for almost all pairs of m and d.

Remark 32 Proposition 3 is a simple corollary of Lemma 29 and Proposition 30. Corollary 4 follows from
Proposition 3 and [BT15, Thm. 3].

7 Appendix: on relation between ICA and polynomial decompositions

The material in this section is mostly available in [CQU15]. We add this material for completeness. Consider
a linear mixing model (2) (for the case K = R). Then the cumulants of x up to order d can be expanded as

C(1)
x = c1,1v1 + · · · + c1,rvr,
C(2)
x = c2,1v1 ⊗ v1 + · · · + c2,rvr ⊗ vr,

...

C(d)
x = cd,1v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 + · · · + cd,rvr ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr,

(28)

where cj,k is the j-th cumulant of the random variable sk [CJ10, ch. 9], [McC87].

There is a one-to-one correspondence between symmetric

mials of degree s [CGLM08]:

T (z) = C •
1

z · · · •
s

Now assume that tensor C admits the CP decomposition

z

z.

s

}|

{

(29)

(30)

(31)

Then, by (29), decomposition (30) is equivalent to the decomposition

C = c1v1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ v1 + · · · + crvr ⊗ · · · ⊗ vr.

T (z) = c1ℓd

1(z) + · · · + crℓd

r(z),

where ℓk(z) := v⊤

k z is a linear form. The decomposition (31) is called Waring decomposition [IK99, CGLM08].

By equivalence between (30) and (31), the system (28) can be rewritten as

T (1)(z) = c1,1ℓ1(z) + · · · + c1,rℓr(z),
T (2)(z) = c2,1ℓ2
r(z),

1(z) + · · · + c2,rℓ2

...

T (d)(z) = cd,1ℓd

1(z) + · · · + cd,rℓd

r(z).

Now deﬁne the non-homogeneous polynomial F ∈ K≤d[z] as

F (z) = T (1)(z) + · · · + T (d)(z),

(32)

(33)

Then from (32) it is easy to see that simultaneous Waring decomposition (32) (hence, the simultaneous
symmetric CP decomposition (28)) is equivalent to the following problem: Given a multivariate polynomial
F ∈ K≤d[z], ﬁnd minimal r, gk ∈ K≤d[t] (univariate polynomials) and vk ∈ Km such that

where ℓk = v⊤

k z and gk(t) = c1,kt + · · · + cd,ktd. Obviously, decomposition (34) is equivalent to (4).

F (z) =

rXk=1

gk(ℓk(z)),
