A viscous-convective instability in laminar Keplerian thin

discs

Using the anelastic approximation of

linearized hydrodynamic equations, we investigate the
development of axially symmetric small perturbations in thin Keplerian discs. Dispersion relation is
found as a solution of general Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem for diﬀerent values of relevant physical
parameters (viscosity, heat conductivity, disc semithickness). The analysis reveals the appearance of
overstable mode for Prandtl parameter higher than some critical value. These modes have a viscous-
convective nature and can serve as a seed for turbulence in astrophysical discs even in the absence of
magnetic ﬁelds.

1 Introduction

The problem of linear stability of sheared astrophysical ﬂows has been actively studied. The recent
papers [1], [2] used the Boussinesq and anelastic approximations, respectively, with taking into account
microscopic viscosity and thermal conductivity of the gas. These analyses have revealed the presence of
overstable viscous modes whose physical origin is likely to be connected to development of convective
motions in vertically stratiﬁed accretion ﬂows. However, in those papers averaging over vertical disc
structure was performed, which restricted applications of the obtained results. In the present paper, we
take into account more realistic polytropic structure of a Keplerian accretion disc and solve linearized
general Sturm–Liuville eigenvalue problem. Our analysis conﬁrms the appearance of the overstable modes
in the wide range of microscopic parameters of the gas described by the Prandtl number.

2 Basic equations

where Nr, Nφ and Nz are viscous forces. For their speciﬁc form see for instance [3].
In this work we will drop the second derivatives of velocities u with respect to the vertical coordinate
z in the Navier–Stokes equations following [2]. This assumption makes the problem simpler and the
more general problem will be solved in [4].

(5)

where s is speciﬁc entropy per particle, Qvisc is the viscous dissipation rate per unit volume, R is
the universal gas constant, µ is the molecular weight, T is the temperature and terms on the right
stand for the viscous energy production and the heat conductivity energy ﬂux F , respectively. The
energy ﬂux due to the heat conductivity is

∇ · F = ∇(−κ∇T ) = −κ∆T − ∇κ · ∇T .

(6)

In the Boussinesq approximation, in the energy equation the Eulerian perturbations should be zero:
p1 = 0. Following [1], we will also drop the term ∇κ · ∇T but keep κ∆T .

3 Linearized equations in the anelastic approximation

Perturbed hydrodynamic variables can be written in the form x = x0 + x1, where x0 stands for the
unperturbed background quantities and x1 = (ρ1, p1, ur 1, uz 1, uφ 1) are small perturbations. We take
all these small perturbations in the form x1 = f (z) · exp (iωt − ikrr). We will consider thin discs with
semithickness z0/r (cid:28) 1 and relatively large radial wavenumbers of perturbations krr (cid:29) 1. Small thickness
of the disc and large wavenumbers allow us to set the radial derivatives to zero, ∂x0/∂r = 0. Under these
assumptions, linearizing of the system of equations (1—5) yields the following system of equations[1, 2]:

It is necessary to set the background solution of hydrodynamic equations to ﬁnd solution for

perturbations. As the background state, we will use adiabatic polytropic discs [5]:

T0(z) = Tc

ρ0(z) = ρc

This system of algebraic and diﬀerential equations can be transformed to one second-order diﬀerential

equation for pressure perturbations p1:

The pressure perturbation p1 must vanish at the disc boundary (z = z0), and the function p1(z) should
be even or odd because of the plane symmetry of the problem. Bellow we will consider the case of even
p1(z) with the boundary conditions:

β(ω) =

(15)

(16)

We are searching for the least oscillating solutions, which means that p1(z) should not have zeros between
z = 0 and z = z0. This condition comes from our previous assumption about the smallness of the
secondary derivatives of velocities in the Navier–Stokes equations (2–4).

Using a new variable x ≡ z/z0, equation (12) transforms to:

Let us introduce a new function Y (x):

Y ≡ p1 × exp

where M is the conﬂuent hypergeometric function, η(ω) ≡ −1 − β(ω)/α(ω).

An eigenfunction of the problem (with the boundary condition (22)) must satisfy the following relation:

Yη(ω)((cid:112)α(ω)) = 0.

(24)

The last relation can be regarded as an equation for the unknown variable ω, then the solutions to this
equations are eigenvalues of our problem, and the corresponding Yη(ζ) will be its eigenfunctions.

4 Dispersion relation

Solution of the eigenvalue problem depends of the sign of the linearized term κ∆T , which appears in the
energy equation (11) in the form:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)2 µ

.

(25)

If the Prandtl number Pr ≤ 16/225 and this relation is negative, there is only one mode of the dispersion
equation which corresponds to a decaying mode (see Fig. 1). Otherwise, if Pr > 16/225, an additional
overstable mode appears (see Fig. 2).
Fig. 3 shows the dependence of Im(ω) of the overstable mode on the viscosity parameters l/r and
vs/vφ. Fig. 4 shows the diﬀerence p1(x)− cos(π/2 x) corresponding to the eigenfunction of the overstable
mode for Pr = 0.1, krr = 40, l/r = 0.01 and vs/vφ = 0.01.

5 Conclusions

Using the anelastic approximation of linearized hydrodynamic equations, we studied the development
of axially symmetric small perturbations in thin Keplerian discs. Dispersion relation is derived as a
solution of general Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem for pressure perturbations. An overstable mode
is discovered for diﬀerent values of the disc thickness and microscopic viscosity and thermal conductivity
of the gas. The overstability appears when the Prandtl parameter exceeds a critical value 16/225. The
unstable mode has viscous-convective nature and can serve as a seed for turbulence in astrophysical discs
even in the absence of magnetic ﬁelds.

In the left panel, the value of vs/vφ = 0.01 is constant for all curves. The viscosity changes in proportion
to l/r and Im(ω) changes in the same way. On the right panel both vs/vφ and l/r changes in the same
way so that the term (25) keeps constant. Here the range of wavenumbers krr of the overstable mode
decreases inversely proportional to the disc thickness.

with cos (π/2 x) subtracted for better visualisation of the imaginary part of the eigenfunction. The solid
