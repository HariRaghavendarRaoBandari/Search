TRACY L. PAYNE AND MATTHEW SCHROEDER

ABSTRACT. Uniform Lie algebras are combinatorially deﬁned two-step
nilpotent Lie algebras which can be used to deﬁne Einstein solvmani-
folds. These Einstein spaces often have nontrivial isotropy groups. We
derive basic properties of uniform Lie algebras and we classify uniform
Lie algebras with ﬁve or fewer generators. We deﬁne a type of directed
colored graph called a uniformly colored graph and establish a corre-
spondence between uniform Lie algebras and uniformly colored graphs.
We present several methods of constructing inﬁnite families of uniformly
colored graphs and corresponding uniform Lie algebras.

1. INTRODUCTION

A Riemannian manifold is Einstein if its Ricci form is a scalar multiple
of its metric. One approach to the study of Einstein manifolds is to focus on
classes of Einstein manifolds with symmetry, such as homogeneous spaces
and spaces of cohomogeneity one (see [32, 33]). We are interested in a
special class of Einstein homogeneous spaces: Einstein solvmanifolds. A
solvmanifold is a simply connected solvable group endowed with a left-
invariant Riemannian metric.

In [10], a representation of a compact Lie group is used to deﬁne a two-
step metric nilpotent Lie algebra, which can then be used to deﬁne an Ein-
stein solvmanifold. In [10, 9, 17], and [14], the geometry of these solv-
manifolds was studied. Such nilpotent Lie algebras have large automor-
phism groups and the afﬁliated Einstein solvmanifolds have isotropy groups
with positive dimension. In his earlier study of Einstein solvmanifolds [7],

DeLoff deﬁned a class of nilpotent Lie algebras called uniform Lie alge-
bras enjoying combinatorial symmetry instead of algebraic symmetry (see
Deﬁnition 2.1). Every uniform Lie algebra can be used to deﬁne an Ein-
stein solvmanifold, and due to the combinatorial regularity in the deﬁnition
of uniform Lie algebra, the Einstein solvmanifolds often have nontrivial
isotropy groups which may now be ﬁnite or inﬁnite. The category of uni-
form Lie algebras includes many of the Lie algebras deﬁned by represen-
tations of compact Lie groups, and well-known classes of two-step nilpo-
tent Lie algebras, such as Heisenberg Lie algebras, two-step free nilpotent
Lie algebras, Iwasawa type nilpotent Lie algebras for rank one symmetric
spaces of noncompact type, and Lie algebras of Heisenberg type.

In this work, we study uniform Lie algebras. For the sake of economy,
we do not explicitly discuss the Einstein solvmanifolds that they determine.
Uniform Lie algebras may be deﬁned over any ﬁeld, and may be of interest
over general ﬁelds from a purely algebraic perspective, but throughout this
work, because of our geometric motivation, we assume that the ﬁeld of
deﬁnition is R.

deﬁnes a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra structure on v⊕ z.
We deﬁne a class of edge colored digraphs, called uniformly colored
graphs, and show that any uniformly colored graph deﬁnes a uniform Lie
algebra, and any uniform Lie algebra may be encoded as a uniformly col-
ored graph. Uniform colorings of graphs are (up to a choice of orientation)
equivalent to H-decompositions of regular graphs with H = K2 +··· + K2;
that is, decompositions of regular graphs into subgraphs all isomorphic to
the same disjoint sum K2 +··· + K2, where K2 is the complete graph on two
vertices.
Algebraic objects are often used to analyze combinatorial and topolog-
ical problems, such as in the case of Orlik-Solomon algebras or free par-
tially commutative monoids, and conversely, graphs or simplices have been
used to deﬁne algebraic objects, as with rooted tree algebras and in Stanley-
Reisner theory. Closer to the topic at hand, Dani and Mainkar deﬁned a
class of two-step nilpotent Lie algebras associated to graphs that they called
nilpotent Lie algebras of graph type ([6]), and Mainkar showed that two

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

nilpotent Lie algebras of graph type are isomorphic if and only if the graphs
they arise from are equivalent ([19]).

Einstein solvmanifolds deﬁned by solvable extensions of nilpotent Lie
algebras of graph type have been studied in [16, 13, 22], and the geometry
of metric nilpotent Lie algebras deﬁned by Schreier graphs was addressed
in [27]. (Although both of these classes of nilpotent Lie algebras, graph
type and Schreier type, overlap with the class of uniform Lie algebras stud-
ied here, there are no containment relations between the class of uniform
Lie algebras and either of these classes. See Remark 4.11.) Pseudo H-type
algebras were analyzed using combinatorial and orthogonal designs in [11].
In [24], it was shown that if rp−q− p +1 > 0, an Einstein solvmanifold de-
ﬁned by a uniform metric Lie algebra of type (p, q, r) admits nonisometric
Einstein deformations.

We derive basic properties of uniform Lie algebras and uniformly col-
ored graphs. We show how algebraic properties of a uniform Lie algebra
translate to graph theoretic properties of the corresponding uniformly col-
ored graph. We show in Proposition 4.14 how totally geodesic subalgebras
of a uniform Lie algebra may be found using the corresponding uniform
graph. In Proposition 4.17, we show that graph unions correspond to con-
catenations of Lie algebras, and in Propositions 4.18 and 4.20 we determine
when graph unions of uniform graphs are again uniform.

We give many examples of uniform Lie algebras and uniformly col-
ored graphs, some in inﬁnite families. We show uniform Lie algebras
can be found from well-known combinatorially deﬁned graphs, such as
Kneser graphs, and decompositions of familiar regular graphs, such as one-
factorizations and near-one-factorizations of complete graphs. We present
a general method of constructing uniform Lie algebras from Cayley graphs.
These examples indirectly give a wealth of new examples of Einstein solv-
manifolds.

Many of the examples we give come from graphs with symmetries, and
the corresponding Einstein solvmanifolds inherit those symmetries. We
show in Proposition 4.16 that the symmetry group of a uniformly colored
digraph embeds in the automorphism group of the corresponding uniform
Lie algebra. Thus, the automorphism group of a uniform Lie algebra may
contain a nontrivial ﬁnite subgroup, and the corresponding Einstein solv-
manifold will have that ﬁnite group as a subgroup of its isotropy group.
In addition, the corresponding simply connected Lie groups may have in-
franilmanifold quotients. (For all uniform Lie algebras, the corresponding
simply connected nilpotent Lie group admits a lattice).

In Theorem 6.3 we classify all uniform Lie algebras with ﬁve or fewer
generators; a complete list appears in Table 1. There are only 12 Lie alge-
bras in the list, demonstrating that uniform Lie algebras are not so common

4

in low dimensions. However, there are many in higher dimensions (See
Remark 5.9).

In addition to the examples that we present here, many more uniform
edge colorings can be found on well-known graphs and families of graphs.
We leave it to the interested reader to construct uniform edge colorings on
the Heawood graph and the Desargues graph; one-skeletons of symmetric
polyhedra; some (but not all) circulant graphs, some (but not all) bipartite
graphs, and graphs arising from incidence geometries. All the resulting
uniformly colored graphs deﬁne Einstein solvmanifolds, with the symmetry
groups of the colored graphs embedding into the isometry groups of the
manifolds.

We pose two problems. The same strategy we used for the proof of The-
orem 6.3 can be used to classify uniform Lie algebras of type (p, q, r) with
q ≥ 6. To assist in this goal, and of independent interest, one could analyze
inﬁnite classes of uniform Lie algebras of type (p, q, r) which exist for all
possible q ≥ 6, or in the cubic case, all even q ≥ 6.
Problem 1.1. What are the structure and algebraic properties of uniform Lie
algebras that have an underlying graph which is a cycle? a bipartite graph?
a complete graph? a cubic graph?

This involves a simply stated problem in graph theory.

Problem 1.2. What are the structure and properties of K2 +···+K2-decompositions
of regular graphs?

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give the
formal deﬁnition of a uniform (metric) Lie algebra and present some illu-
minating examples.
In Section 3, we derive basic properties of uniform
Lie algebras. Then, in Section 4, we deﬁne uniformly colored graphs, give
the correspondences between uniform Lie algebras and uniformly colored
graphs, and translate between algebraic properties of Lie algebras and prop-
erties of uniformly colored graphs. In Section 5 we present a variety of
constructions of uniformly colored graphs. Finally in Section 6 we classify
uniform type Lie algebras with ﬁve or fewer generators.

2. DEFINITION AND SOME EXAMPLES

The ﬁrst thing we do is deﬁne Lie algebras of uniform type and give
some examples. The deﬁnition may seem complicated at ﬁrst, but once a
connection is made with Deﬁnition 4.1, it will seem quite simple.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Let p, q, and r be positive integers. A real nilpotent Lie
algebra n is said to be of uniform of type (p, q, r) if there exists a basis
j=1 of n and a positive integer s, called the degree, such
B = {vi}
that the following properties hold.

i=1 ∪{z j}p

q

(1) For all i, j = 1, . . . , q and all l, m = 1, . . . , p,

(a) [vi, z j] = 0 and [zl, zm] = 0,
(b) [vi, v j] ∈ {0,±z1, . . . ,±zp}.

[vi, v j] = zl.

(2) If [vi, v j] is nonzero and [vi, v j] = ±[vi, vk], then v j = vk.
(3) For all l = 1, . . ., p, there exist exactly r disjoint pairs {vi, v j} with
(4) For all j = 1, . . ., q, there exist exactly s basis vectors vi with [vi, v j] 6=
The basis B is called a uniform basis for n. When F = R, it is natural to
endow n with the inner product Q which makes B orthonormal; then we
call (n, Q) a uniform metric Lie algebra.

0.

Note that the parameters p, q, r and s in the deﬁnition are dependent: the
number of nonzero structure constants relative to the basis B is sq = 2rp.
The uniform basis has rational structure constants, so by Mal’cev’s Crite-
rion, the simply connected Lie groups corresponding to uniform Lie alge-
bras always admit compact quotients.

The most simple examples of uniform Lie algebras are Heisenberg alge-

bras and free nilpotent algebras.

Example 2.2. Let h2n+1 be the Heisenberg Lie algebra with basis B =
({xi}n
i=1) ∪ {z} and Lie bracket deﬁned by [xi, yi] = z for i =
1, . . ., n. With respect to the basis B, h2n+1 is a uniform Lie algebra of
type(p, q, r) = (1, 2n, n) with degree s = 1.

i=1 ∪ {yi}n

Note that the uniform basis for h2n+1 is not unique; in fact, there are

uncountably many different uniform bases.

Example 2.3. Let fn,2 be the free two-step nilpotent Lie algebra on n gen-
erators with basis {xi}n
i=1 ∪ {xi ∧ x j}1≤i< j≤n and Lie bracket deﬁned by
[xi, x j] = xi ∧ x j for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. With respect to this basis, fn,2 is a uni-
form Lie algebra. The values of the associated parameters are (p, q, r) =
(( n
2), n, 1) and s = n− 1.
Algebras of Heisenberg type are two-step metric nilpotent Lie algebras
which have been studied extensively by geometers ([1]). Crandall and
Dodziuk have shown that all algebras of Heisenberg type are uniform ([5]).
Here is an example of a metric Lie algebra of Heisenberg type.

Example 2.4. Let (n, Q) be the nilpotent metric Lie algebra with orthonor-
mal basis B = {v1, v2, v3, v4}∪{z1, z2} and Lie bracket
(1)

[v1, v2] = [v3, v4] = z1, [v2, v3] = [v1, v4] = z2.

This Lie algebra is uniform of type (2, 4, 2).

6

T. L. PAYNE AND M. SCHROEDER

We may generalize Example 2.4 to higher dimensions, although the ex-

amples in dimension 2r + 2 > 6 are no longer Heisenberg type.
Example 2.5. For r ≥ 2, deﬁne the Lie algebra n(2r + 2) of dimension
2r + 2 to have basis B = {vi}2r
i=1 ∪{z1, z2} and Lie bracket determined by
[v2i−1, v2i] = z1
[v2i, v2i+1] = z2
[v1, v2r] = z2.

for i = 1, 2, . . ., r,
for i = 1, 2, . . ., r− 1,

With respect to the basis B, n(2r + 2) is a uniform Lie algebra of type
(2, 2r, r) with s = 2.

We may also change one sign in the deﬁning bracket relations for n(2r +
2) to deﬁne the uniform Lie algebra n′(2r + 2) with uniform basis B =
{vi}2r

i=1 ∪{z1, z2} and Lie bracket
[v2i−1, v2i] = z1
[v2i, v2i+1] = z2
[v2r, v1] = z2.

for i = 1, 2, . . ., r,
for i = 1, 2, . . ., r− 1,

The Heisenberg type Lie algebra in the next example is isomorphic to
the Iwasawa type nilpotent Lie algebra in the Iwasawa decomposition of
the Lie algebra of the isometry group of quaternionic hyperbolic space of
dimension 8.

Example 2.6. Let (n, Q) be the metric nilpotent Lie algebra with orthonor-
mal basis B = {vi}4
(2) [v1, v2] = [v3, v4] = z1, [v1, v3] = −[v2, v4] = z2, [v1, v4] = [v2, v3] = z3.
With respect to B, n is a uniform Lie algebra of type (3, 4, 2).

j=1 and Lie bracket

i=1 ∪{z j}3

As already seen in Example 2.5, it is possible that there are two or more
uniform Lie algebras which have the same set of indices of nonzero struc-
ture constants relative to a uniform basis; these may or may not be isomor-
phic. In the next example we present a uniform Lie algebra which, with
respect to the uniform basis, has the same indices for nonzero structure
constants as the Lie algebra in Example 2.6.

i=1 ∪{z j}3

Example 2.7. Let (n, Q) be the metric nilpotent Lie algebra with orthonor-
mal basis B = {vi}4
(3) [v1, v2] = [v3, v4] = z1, [v1, v3] = [v2, v4] = z2, [v1, v4] = −[v2, v3] = z3.
This metric Lie algebra is not of Heisenberg type; therefore n is not isomor-
phic to the Lie algebra in Example 2.6.

j=1 and Lie bracket

This presentation of n is not the most efﬁcient one, in the sense that more
nontrivial brackets of basis vectors appear than is necessary. With respect
to a different basis C = {ui}4
(4)

[u1, u2] = y1, [u1, u3] = [u2, u4] = y2, [u3, u4] = y3.

j=1, the Lie algebra is given by

i=1 ∪{y j}3

The bases B and C are related by

v1 = u1 + u3, v2 = u2 + u4, v3 = u3 − u1, v4 = u4 − u2

z1 = y1 + y3, z2 = 2y2, z3 = −y1 + y3.
Note that the basis C is not orthogonal with respect to Q.

The following family m(q) of nilpotent Lie algebras arose in the study
of Anosov Lie algebras (Example 4.4, [23]). Because a cyclic group acts
transitively on it, it is among a class of nilpotent Lie algebras called cyclic
Lie algebras.
Example 2.8. Let m(q) be the nilpotent Lie algebra with basis B ={vi}

[v1, v2] = z1, [v2, v3] = z2, . . ., [vq, v1] = zq.

3. PROPERTIES OF UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS

In this section we derive some basic properties of uniform Lie algebras.
First we review some standard deﬁnitions. Let (n, Q) be a two-step nilpotent
metric Lie algebra with center z, and let v be the orthogonal complement to
the center. For all z ∈ z, the map Jz in End(v) is deﬁned by Jzv = ad∗v z for
all v ∈ v, where ad∗v is the metric dual of the linear map adv .
p
j=1, we can use the
identity Q(Jzlvi, v j) = Q([vi, v j], zl) to show that

Since n is uniform with respect to B, for ﬁxed i and l, there is at most one

Fundamental properties of uniform Lie algebras are collected in the next
theorem. Recall that the Frobenius inner product on End(Rq) is deﬁned by
hA, Bi = trace(ABT ) for A, B ∈ End(Rq).
Theorem 3.2. Let n be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q, r) with uniform
basis B = {vi}q
i=1 and let z =
p
span{z j}
j=1. Then n is a two-step nilpotent Lie algebra with the following
properties.

j=1 and degree s. Let v = span{vi}q

i=1 ∪{z j}p

[vi, v j] = 0}∪{z j}p

j=1, and it has dimension p + q− s.

(1) The center of n is z, and [n, n] = z.
(2) The centralizer C(vi) of any vector vi in B is spanned by {v j :
(3) For all vi in B, the rank of advi is s.
(4) For all z j in B, the rank of Jz j is 2r.
(5) The set of maps {Jz j}
z j = √2r.

p
j=1 is orthogonal with respect to the Frobenius
inner product on v. For all z j in B, the Frobenius norm of Jz j is
q−trace J2

To prove the theorem we require the lemma below.

q

p

Lemma 3.3. Let n be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q, r) with uniform
basis B = {vi}

j=1 and degree s. Let vi ∈ B. Then the set

i=1 ∪{z j}

Ai = {[vi, v j] : v j ∈ B and [vi, v j] 6= 0}
j=1 of cardinality s.

is a linearly independent subset of {z j}p
Proof. Let vi ∈ B, and let Ai be as in the statement of the lemma. Since the
degree s in Part (4) of the deﬁnition of uniform Lie algebra is assumed to
be positive, Ai is nonempty.

From Part (1) of the deﬁnition of uniform Lie algebra we see that Ai ⊆
p
{±z1,±z2, . . . ,±zp}. As {z j}
j=1 is a subset of a basis, it is linearly indepen-
dent. Therefore, in order to show that Ai is linearly independent, it sufﬁces
to show that if zl ∈ Ai, then −zl 6∈ Ai. Assume to the contrary that zl and −zl
q
are both in Ai. Then there exist v j and vk in {vi}
i=1, necessarily distinct, so
that [vi, v j] = zl and [vi, vk] = −zl. We then have [vi, v j] = −[vi, vk], and by
Part (2) of the deﬁnition of uniform Lie algebra, v j = vk, a contradiction.
Hence zl and −zl are not both in Ai, and the set Ai is linearly independent.

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

By Part (4) of the deﬁnition of uniform Lie algebra, the cardinality of Ai
(cid:3)

is s.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 3.2.

q

i=1

b

p
j=1

i=1 ∪{z j}p

Proof. Let (n, Q) be a uniform metric Lie algebra with uniform basis B =
j=1. It follows easily from Part (1) of Deﬁnition 2.1 that z =
{vi}
p
span{z j}
j=1 is contained in the center of n. To show that the center is no
larger, assume that x is in the center. Write x with respect to the uniform
jz j. We must show that a i = 0 for all i. Fix
basis, so x = (cid:229) q
i0. By Part (2) of the deﬁnition of uniform Lie algebra, there is some vk ∈ B
so that [vi0, vk] 6= 0. Then
q(cid:229)

a ivi + (cid:229)

j[vk, z j] =

j=1

i=1

Since [vk, vi0] 6= 0, Lemma 3.3 implies that a i0 = 0. Hence, the center of n
is z.
Now we show that the commutator subalgebra [n, n] is equal to z. It fol-
lows from Part (1) of the deﬁnition of uniform Lie algebra that [n, n] ⊆ z. By
Part (3) of the deﬁnition, zl ∈ [n, n] for all z j ∈ B. Hence [n, n] = z. From
the properties of the bracket relations, we have [n, [n, n]] = {0}, so n is a
two-step nilpotent Lie algebra.
p
j=1), be-
cause it is similar to the proof of Part (1). Since the spanning vectors
are linearly independent, the dimension of C(vi) is equal to the cardinal-
ity of the spanning set. By Part (4) of the deﬁnition of uniform Lie algebra,
{v j : [vi, v j] = 0} has cardinality q − s. Hence the dimension of C(vi) is
p + q− s.

We omit the proof that C(vi) = span({v j : [vi, v j] = 0} ∪ {z j}

Part (3) of the proposition follows immediately from Lemma 3.3.
For Part (4) of the proposition, we use Proposition 3.1. Fix zl. The def-
inition of uniform Lie algebra says that there are exactly r disjoint pairs
{vi, v j} with [vi, v j] = zl. By Proposition 3.1, the image of Jzl is the span of
all vi and v j so that [vi, v j] = zl. Since the cardinality of that set is 2r, the
map Jzl has rank 2r.

Last we show that Part (5) holds. Let zk, zl ∈ B. The number trace(JzkJT
zl )
is nonzero if and only if there are i and j so that Jzkvi = ±v j and Jzlvi =
±v j. But then ±zk = [vi, v j] = ±zl. This is not possible for distinct k and
l, because zk and zl are linearly independent. By Proposition 3.1, after a
change of basis, Jzl is block diagonal, with nonzero blocks of form ( 0 −1
1 0 ).
zl ) = −trace(J2
There are precisely r of these blocks. Hence trace(JzlJT
zl ) =
2r.

Remark 3.4. Statement (5) in the theorem may not be improved to say that
traceJ2

z = −2r for all unit z ∈ z. For example, this fails in Example 2.8.

As a corollary to the previous theorem, since p is the dimension of the
center, and p + q equals the total dimension, both of the parameters p and q
are isomorphism invariants for uniform Lie algebras.

Corollary 3.5. Let n1 be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p1, q1, r1) and let
n2 be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p2, q2, r2). If n1 and n2 are isomorphic,
then p1 = p2 and q1 = q2.

The parameter r is not an isomorphism invariant for uniform Lie algebras,

as seen in the following example taken from [20].
Example 3.6. Let n = h3 ⊕ h3 with basis B = {x1, x2, x3, x4} ∪ {z1, z2},
where [x1, x2] = z1 and [x3, x4] = z2. The basis B is a uniform basis of type
(2, 4, 1).
With respect to the basis C = {ui}4
u1 = x1 +x3, u2 = x2 +x4, u3 = x1−x3, u4 = x2−x4, w1 = z1 +z2, w2 = z2−z1,
the Lie bracket is given by

i=1 ∪{w j}2

j=1 given by

[u1, u2] = [u3, u4] = w1, [u2, u3] = [u4, u1] = w2.

Hence n = h3⊕ h3 is isomorphic to n′(2r +2) with r = 2 as in Example 2.5.
With respect to the basis C , n is uniform of type (2, 4, 2).

Two Lie algebras m and n with bases B and C respectively are said to be
associates with respect to bases B and C if their structure constants agree
up to sign. That is, if a k
i j denotes a structure constant for m with respect
to B, and b k
i j denotes a structure constants for n with respect to C , then
(a k
i j)2 = (b k
i j)2 for all (i, j, k). The Lie algebras in Examples 2.6 and 2.7 are
nonisomorphic associates, as are the two families in Example 2.5. It is clear
from the deﬁnition that uniform Lie algebras come in classes of associates.

Proposition 3.7. Suppose that the Lie algebras m and n with bases B and
C respectively are associates with respect to bases B and C . Then m is a
uniform Lie algebra with respect to the uniform basis B if and only if n is
a uniform Lie algebra with respect to the uniform basis C .

Remark 3.8. Given a family of associate uniform Lie algebras (relative to
given bases) as in Proposition 3.7, how can we determine which members
of the family are isomorphic? In general, it can be very difﬁcult to ﬁnd an
isomorphism between two Lie algebras. However, there is a simple compu-
tational method for ﬁnding isomorphic associate Lie algebras when the two
presentations are related by a change of basis which simply changes signs

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

of basis vectors. This procedure is described in Theorem B of [24]; one
simply needs to ﬁnd the orbits of a Zn
2 (deﬁned in Deﬁnition
5 in [24]). We will use this method to ﬁnd these kinds of isomorphic Lie
algebras within classes of associate uniform Lie algebras, but because the
set-up is somewhat technical, we do not reproduce the theorem statement
here and refer the reader to [24] for details. Worked out examples of the
method are given in [25]; see Examples 3.6, 3.7 and 4.5 there.

When the parameter r of a uniform Lie algebra with uniform basis B is

equal to one, then it is isomorphic to all of its associates relative to B.

Proposition 3.9. Let n be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q, 1) with uni-
form basis B. If m is an associate to n with respect to the basis B, then m
and n are isomorphic.
Proof. Let a k

one pair of indices {i, j} so that structure constants a k

A change of basis sending zk to −zk while leaving all other basis vectors
ﬁxed changes the signs ofa k
ji while leaving all remaining structure
constants the same. By making all possible combinations of such changes
of basis we obtain all possible sign choices for the structure constants. (cid:3)

Finally, we give some useful relationships the parameters p, q, r and s that

Let G = (V, E) be a uniformly colored graph of type (p, q, r) with degree s.
Then the same constraints hold, and p divides |E|.
Proof. We have previously remarked that 2rp = sq because both numbers
are equal to the number of nontrivial structure constants with respect to the
uniform basis.

4. UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

4.1. Deﬁnition and examples of uniformly colored graph. Let (V, E) be
a graph with vertex set V and edge set E. We always assume that all of our
graphs are without loops or multiple edges. A graph is regular of degree s
if each vertex has exactly s neighbors. An orientation of the graph (V, E) is
a map s
: E → V ×V assigning to each edge {v, w} one of the ordered pairs
(v, w) and (w, v). Then (V, E), together with s , naturally deﬁnes a directed
graph.

An edge coloring of a directed or undirected graph G = (V, E) is a map c
from E to a set S. Let G = (V, E) be a graph with edge coloring c : E → S.
A coloring is proper if no adjacent edges have the same color. We say that
a mapping f
: G → G is a color-permuting automorphism or automorphism
of the colored graph if f
is an automorphism of the underlying graph, and
there is a permutation s of the color set S so that c◦f (v, w) = s ◦ c(v, w) for
all (v, w) ∈ E. Two edge colorings b and c of a graph are called equivalent
if there is a color-permuting automorphism f so that c = f ◦ b.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let (V, E) be an undirected graph with q vertices which
is regular of degree s. Let S be a set of cardinality p, and let the surjective
function c : E → S deﬁne an edge coloring of (V, E). Then the edge coloring
is a uniform edge coloring of type (p, q, r) with degree s if the edge-colored
graph has the following properties.

(1) The coloring is proper.
(2) Each color occurs the same number, r, of times; i.e. the cardinality

of c−1({s}) is r, for all s ∈ S.

When the undirected graph (V, E) is endowed with such a coloring it is
called a uniformly colored graph of type (p, q, r). A directed graph is a
uniformly colored graph of type (p, q, r) if it is an undirected uniformly
colored graph of type (p, q, r) endowed with an orientation. A graph with a
uniform edge coloring is said to be uniformly colored.

Note that if a uniformly colored graph G = (V, E) is directed, because G
arises from imposing an orientation on an undirected graph, it is not pos-
sible for both (vi, v j) and (vi, v j) to be in E. For the convenience of the
reader, the next proposition summarizes how the parameters p, q, r and s for
a uniformly colored graph are reﬂected in the graph. The proof is an easy
application of deﬁnitions.
Proposition 4.2. A uniformly colored graph G = (V, E) of type (p, q, r)
with degree s has q vertices and rp edges. The degree of the underlying

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

13

undirected regular graph is s. There are p colors, and each color occurs on
exactly r different edges.

A decomposition of a graph G is a set of subgraphs H1, ..., Hk which par-
tition the edges of G. Uniform edge colorings of undirected graphs of type
(p, q, r) and degree s are equivalent to decompositions of s-regular graphs
on q vertices into p copies of the r-fold disjoint sum K2 +··· + K2.
Proposition 4.3. Let G be an undirected uniformly colored graph of type
(p, q, r) with degree s. For k = 1, . . ., p, let Hk be the subgraph of G con-
sisting of edges colored with the kth color. Then H1, H2, . . ., Hp deﬁnes a
decomposition of G into p disjoint subgraphs, all isomorphic to the disjoint
sum K2 +··· + K2 of r copies of K2.
Conversely, if G = (V, E) is an undirected s-regular graph with q ver-
tices and H1, . . . , Hp is a decomposition of G into disjoint subgraphs each
isomorphic to the disjoint sum K2 +··· + K2, then the coloring c : E → [p]
deﬁned by coloring an edge k if it is in the factor Hk is a uniform edge
coloring of G.

(We use [n] to denote the set {1, 2, . . ., n}.) The proposition follows from
the deﬁnition of uniformly colored graph. The next example shows that any
regular graph admits a uniform edge coloring.
Example 4.4. Let (V, E) be a regular graph with q vertices and p edges. Let
the identity map id : E → E deﬁne a coloring. The resulting edge-colored
graph is uniformly colored of type (p, q, 1).
4.2. Graph-algebra correspondences. We associate to any uniform Lie
algebra a uniform graph, and to any uniform graph a uniform Lie algebra.
Deﬁnition 4.5. Let (n, Q) be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q, r) with uni-
q
form basis B = {vi}
i=1,
and let the set of directed edges be

j=1. Deﬁne a set of vertices by V = {vi}

p

Deﬁne an edge coloring of the graph (V, E) by mapping E into the set
{z j}

j=1 so that the edge (vi, v j) ∈ E is assigned to zk if [vi, v j] = zk.
By Property (2) of the deﬁnition of uniform metric Lie algebras, the col-

oring function is well-deﬁned.
Proposition 4.6. The graph associated to a uniform Lie algebra of type
(p, q, r) with degree s, as in Deﬁnition 4.5, is a uniformly colored graph of
type (p, q, r) with degree s.
Proof. The graph has no loops because [vi, vi] = 0 for all i. There are no
multiple edges from vi to v j because [vi, v j] is single-valued, and it is not

possible to have both (vi, v j) and (v j, vi) as an edge because [vi, v j] = [v j, vi]
implies that [vi, v j] = 0. Clearly there are q vertices and p colors. By Prop-
erty (2) of Deﬁnition 2.1, the coloring is proper. Property (3) of Deﬁnition
2.1 insures that each color occurs the exactly r times and that the coloring
function is surjective.
(cid:3)

Now we associate a uniform Lie algebra to any uniformly colored graph.
Deﬁnition 4.7. Let (V, E) be a uniformly colored directed graph of type
(p, q, r) and degree s. Let V = {vi}
j=1 and let c : E → S be
the surjective edge coloring function. Let n be the vector space with basis
V ∪ S. Deﬁne a Lie bracket on n by setting

i=1, let S = {z j}p

q

setting [vi, z j] = 0 and [z j, zk] = 0 for all i, j, k, and extending bilinearly.

As the graph is uniform, it is not possible for both (vi, v j) and (v j, vi) to
be in E, so the Lie bracket in the deﬁnition is well-deﬁned. By deﬁnition the
Lie bracket is skew-symmetric. It is easy to see that [n, n] = span{z j}p
j=1
and [n, [n, n]] = 0, so the algebra is two-step nilpotent. Hence, the Jacobi
Identity holds trivially. Thus, the product in Equation (6) truly does deﬁne
a Lie algebra.
Example 4.8. The uniformly colored graph afﬁliated with the cyclic Lie
algebra m(q) in Example 2.8 is the cycle graph Cq with q vertices (endowed
with an orientation). All q edges have different colors.

The correspondences we have deﬁned between uniformly colored graphs

and uniform Lie algebras are inverse to one another.
Proposition 4.9. The correspondences between uniform Lie algebras (with
ﬁxed uniform bases) and uniformly colored graphs deﬁned in Deﬁnitions
4.5 and Deﬁnition 4.7 are inverse to one another. The Lie algebra corre-
sponding to a uniformly colored graph of type (p, q, r) with degree s is a
uniform Lie algebra with uniform basis of type (p, q, r) and degree s.

The proof is straightforward, so we leave it to the reader.

Remark 4.10. The correspondences in Deﬁnitions 4.5 and 4.7 between edge-
colored graphs and algebras are deﬁned more generally, even if not all of the
properties of a uniform Lie algebra or uniformly colored graph hold. In the
most general situation, there is a correspondence between edge-weighted
directed graphs (possibly with loops or multiple edges) and two-step nilpo-
tent Lie algebras. This is carefully described in Remark 3.2 of [27].

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

15

Remark 4.11. The two-step nilpotent Lie algebras of graph type from [6]
can be deﬁned as follows. Let G = (V, E) be a graph on q vertices without
q
multiple edges or loops, where V = {vi}
i=1. Let v be the real span of V,
so v ∼= Rq. Let n = v⊕ z, where z = span{vi ∧ v j : {vi, v j} ∈ E} ⊆ so(q),
and deﬁne a Lie bracket for n so that the only nonzero bracket relations of
basis vectors are [vi, v j] = vi ∧ v j if the edge {vi, v j} ∈ E. The Lie algebras
in Examples 2.3 and 2.8 are of graph type.
A Lie algebra of graph type need not come from a regular graph, so
not all Lie algebras of graph type are uniform. Lie algebras of graph type
correspond, in the sense of Proposition 4.7, to colored graphs with each
edge colored a different color, as in Example 4.4; hence if they are uniform,
the parameter r is equal to one as in Proposition 3.9. Therefore uniformly
colored graphs of type (p, q, r) with r 6= 1 may fail to be of graph type.
Remark 4.12. An alternate point of view on the deﬁnitions of uniform Lie
algebra and Lie algebras of graph type is from the perspective of ideals.
Every two-step nilpotent Lie algebra with n generators is the quotient of
fn,2, the free two-step nilpotent Lie algebra on n generators, by a central
ideal. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn denote n generators of fn,2 and let B = {xi}n
i=1 ∪
{xi ∧ x j}1≤i< j≤n be the basis for fn,2 as in Example 2.3. Lie algebras of
graph type are quotients of free two-step nilpotent Lie algebras by mono-
mially generated ideals, i.e, ideals spanned by subsets of {xi ∧ x j}1≤i< j≤n,
and every monomially generated ideal deﬁnes a Lie algebra of graph type.
In contrast, akin to toric ideals, ideals deﬁning uniform Lie algebras are
generated by elements of the form xi ∧ x j, with i 6= j, or xi ∧ x j ± xk ∧ xl,
where i, j, k, l are distinct.

4.3. Translations between algebraic properties and graph properties.
The Jz maps deﬁned in Section 3 completely encode the algebraic structure
of a metric nilpotent Lie algebra. The skew-adjacency matrix of a directed
graph G is deﬁned to be the matrix A(G) = (ai j) with ai j = 1 if (vi, v j) ∈ E,
ai j = −1 if (v j, vi) ∈ E, and ai j = 0 otherwise. Skew-adjacency matrices
for uniformly colored graphs are closely related to the Jz maps for the cor-
responding uniform nilpotent Lie algebra.

Proposition 4.13. Let n be a uniform metric Lie algebra with uniform basis

In geometry, it is of interest to understand when submanifolds of homo-
geneous manifolds are totally geodesic. Totally geodesic subalgebras of
metric nilpotent Lie algebras are tangent to totally geodesic submanifolds
of the corresponding nilmanifolds (See [8, 2]). A subalgebra m of a metric
nilpotent Lie algebra is totally geodesic if it is invariant under the Jz map for
all z ∈ m. Recall that the uniformly colored graph G = (V, E) corresponding
to the Lie algebra n with uniform basis B = {vi}q
j=1 has vertex
set V = {vi}q
j=1.
Proposition 4.14. Let (n, Q) be a uniform metric nilpotent Lie algebra with
p
j=1. Let G = (V, E) be the corresponding
uniform basis B = {vi}
uniformly colored graph. Let V′ ⊆ V be a subset of V and let S′ be a subset
j=1, where V′∪S′ 6= /0. Let m be the subspace of n spanned by V ′∪S′.
of {z j}
(1) The subspace m is a subalgebra of (n, Q) if and only if whenever vi
and v j are in V′ and (vi, v j) ∈ E, the color c(vi, v j) is in S′.
(2) Suppose S′ 6= /0. The subspace m is invariant under the Jz map for
all z ∈ m if and only if for all zk ∈ S′, every edge with color zk has
neither or both of its vertices in V ′.

i=1 ∪{z j}p

i=1 ∪{z j}

Proof. The subspace m is a subalgebra if and only if [vi, v j] ∈ span S′ for all
vi, v j ∈ V′. But [vi, v j] is nontrivial if and only if (vi, v j) ∈ E or (v j, vi) ∈ E,
and in that case [vi, v j] = ±zk, where zk is the color of the edge between vi
and v j.
By Proposition 4.13, the Jzk map for color zk inverts edges with color zk;
i.e., if (vi, v j) ∈ E and c(vi, v j) = zk, then Jzk(vi) = v j and Jzk(v j) = −vi, and
if there is no edge colored zk incident to vertex vi, then Jzk(vi) = 0. Hence, if
zk ∈ S′, m is Jzk-invariant if and only if any zk-colored edge with one vertex
in V ′ has the other vertex in V ′.

(cid:3)

The next example describes a type of totally geodesic subalgebra for a

uniform metric nilpotent Lie algebra (n, Q).

Example 4.15. Let H be the union of connected components of G and let
V′ = VH be the set of vertices spanning H. Let S′ = SH be the set of colors
assigned to edges of H. Then VH ∪ SH spans a totally geodesic subalgebra
of (n, Q).

Recall that the basis for deﬁning the Lie algebra n corresponding to a
uniformly colored graph G = (V, E) with colors in S is B = V ∪ S. Any
color-permuting automorphism f of G with permutation s of S extends to
a function ˆf
: n → n of the corresponding uniform Lie algebra n, by deﬁning
ˆf (v) = f (v) for v ∈ V and ˆf (z) = s (z) for z ∈ S, and extending f
from B
bilinearly. We show that the function ˆf
is an automorphism of n.

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

Proposition 4.16. Let f be a color-permuting automorphism of a uniformly
colored directed graph G with corresponding uniformly colored Lie algebra
n. Then the map ˆf
: n → n is an automorphism of n. Furthermore, the map
f
7→ ˆf
from group of color-permuting automorphisms of G to the automor-
phism group of n is injective.
Proof. Let G = (V, E) be a uniformly colored graph with coloring function
c : E → S, and denote the vertices of G by V = {vi}q
: G → G
and s
: S → S deﬁne a color-permuting automorphism of G. Recall that
[vi, v j] 6= 0 if and only if (vi, v j) ∈ E or (v j, vi) ∈ E. Hence [vi, v j] 6= 0 if and
only if [ ˆf (vi), ˆf (v j)] 6= 0, and we need only to check that [ ˆf (vi), ˆf (v j)] =
ˆf ([vi, v j]) for (vi, v j) ∈ E. Assume that (vi, v j) ∈ E. Then (f (vi),f (v j)) ∈ E.
By deﬁnitions of the Lie bracket and ˆf ,

[ ˆf (vi), ˆf (v j)] = [f (vi),f (v j)] = c((f (vi),f (v j))) = c((f (vi, v j)),

while

ˆf ([vi, v j]) = ˆf (c(vi, v j)) = s (c(vi, v j)).

Thus, [ ˆf (vi), ˆf (v j)] = ˆf ([vi, v j]) as desired. Clearly the map f

Recall that the disjoint union G1 +G2 = (V1∪V2, E1∪E2) of graphs G1 =
(V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) is the graph whose vertex set is the union of
the vertex sets of G1 and G2, and whose edge set is the union of the edge
sets of G1 and G2. If G1 and G2 are edge-colored by coloring functions
c1 : E1 → S1 and c2 : E2 → S2, then it is natural to color G1 +G2 by deﬁning
c : E1 ∪ E2 → S1 ∪ S2 by c(e) = c1(e) if e ∈ E1, and c(e) = c2(e) if e ∈ E2.
In the next proposition we show how the disjoint union of two edge-
colored directed graphs translates at the level of corresponding uniform Lie
algebras. Actually, we do not need to assume that the graphs or Lie algebras
in the proposition are uniform; even if regularity axioms involving p, q,
and r are dropped, Deﬁnition 2.1 and Deﬁnition 4.1 still make sense, and
Propositions 4.5 and 4.7 still hold. (See Remark 4.10.)
Proposition 4.17. Suppose that for k = 1, 2, Gk = (Vk, Ek) is a colored
graph of type (pk, qk, rk) with coloring function ck : Ek → Sk. Let n1 and
p1
n2 be the corresponding Lie algebras, and let B1 = {vi}
j=1 and
p2
B2 = {xi}
j=1 be the corresponding uniform bases of n1 and
n2 respectively. Let n be the Lie algebra associated to the colored graph
G1 + G2. Let i be the ideal in n1 ⊕ n2 deﬁned by

i = span{(zi,−w j) : zi = w j}

In particular, if S1 and S2 are disjoint, then n ∼= n1 ⊕ n2.
The idea of the proof is as follows. The center of n1 ⊕ n2 is spanned by
elements (zi, 0) and (0, w j) with zi in the ﬁrst color set S1 and w j in the
second color set S2. To get n(G1 + G2), for every color zi = w j occurring
in both S1 and S2, we need to identify (zi, 0) and (0, w j). Hence the ideal i
must be spanned by (zi,−w j), for all colors with zi = w j.
In the case that S1 ⊇ S2, the Lie algebra n(G1 + G2) in the proposition is
deﬁned by a process that Jablonski calls concatenation of the “structure ma-
trices” of n1 and n2 (Section 3, [12]). In the case that S1 ⊇ S2, the uniform
basis for n(G1 + G2) may be naturally identiﬁed with {vi}
We would like to know when the graph union of uniformly colored graphs
deﬁnes a uniformly colored graph. In the next proposition we consider the
case that the coloring sets are disjoint.
Proposition 4.18. For k = 1 and 2, let Gk = (Vk, Ek) be a uniformly colored
graph of type (pk, qk, rk) with degree sk, and let ck : Ek → Sk be the coloring
function for (Vk, Ek). Assume that the graphs G1 and G2 are disjoint, and
the coloring sets S1 and S2 are disjoint. Deﬁne the coloring function c :
E1 ∪ E2 → S1 ∪ S2 by c(e) = c1(e) if e ∈ E1, and c(e) = c2(e) if e ∈ E2.
Then the following are equivalent:
(1) G1 + G2, endowed with the coloring function c, is a uniformly col-

i=1 ∪{z j}

ored graph.

q1

p
j=1.

(2) s1 = s2 and r1 = r2.

Furthermore, if G1 +G2, endowed with the coloring function c, is uniformly
colored, then it is of type (p1 + p2, q1 + q2, r), where r = r1 = r2, and it has
degree s = s1 = s2.

The proof is elementary. We leave it to the reader.
If we use Proposition 4.17 to re-interpret Proposition 4.18 in terms of
algebras, we see how uniformly colored Lie algebras behave under direct
sums.
Corollary 4.19. Let n1 be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p1, q1, r1), with
uniform basis B1, and let n2 be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p2, q2, r2),
with uniform basis B2. Let n = n1 ⊕ n2 be the direct sum, and let B be the
union of i1(B1) and i2(B2) where i j : n j → n1 ⊕ n2, for i = 1, 2, are the
natural inclusion maps. Then B is a uniform basis of type (p, q, r) if and
only if r1 = r2 and s1 = s2. If B is a uniform basis, then n is uniform of type
(p1 + p2, q1 + q2, r), where r = r1 = r2.

Next we look at the union of disjoint uniformly colored graphs having
same coloring set to see when we get a uniformly colored graph. We leave
the proof to the reader.

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

Proposition 4.20. For k = 1, 2, let Gk = (Vk, Ek) be a uniformly colored
graph of type (p, qk, rk) with degree sk, and edge coloring function ck : Ek →
S. Suppose that the graphs G1 and G2 are disjoint. Deﬁne c : E1 ∪ E2 → S
by c(e) = c1(e) if e ∈ E1, and c(e) = c2(e) if e ∈ E2. Then the following are
equivalent:
(1) G1 + G2, endowed with the coloring function c, is a uniformly col-

ored graph.

(2) s1 = s2.

Furthermore, if G1 + G2 endowed with the coloring function c is uniformly
colored, then it is of type (p, q1 + q2, r1 + r2), with degree s = s1 = s2.

Note that if G is a uniformly colored graph, it is not true that all of its

connected components must be uniformly colored.

Now we translate Proposition 4.20 from graphs to algebras. This corol-
lary overlaps with Proposition 3.4 of [12], which says that if n1 = v1 ⊕ z
and n2 = v2 ⊕ z have Einstein extensions, then so does a concatenation of
n1 and n2.
Corollary 4.21. Let n1 be a uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q1, r1) of degree

5. EXAMPLES OF UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS

5.1. Examples deﬁned by colorings of notable graphs. Many well-known
graphs from combinatorial, geometric or number-theoretic constructions
admit uniform edge colorings. We give just one example here. Recall that
for the Kneser graph Kn,m = (V, E), the vertex set V is the set of subsets of
[n] having cardinality m. Two vertices (sets) are connected by an edge if and
only if they are disjoint. The graph is regular with degree ( n−m
m ). From the
symmetry of the roles of the vertices, any permutation of the n vertices is
an automorphism.
Proposition 5.1. Let Kn,m = (V, E) be a Kneser graph, where m < n/2.
Then Kn,m admits a uniform edge coloring. With this coloring, Kn,m is a
uniformly colored graph of type (p, q, r) = (cid:0)( n
Proof. First we deﬁne the coloring function c. Two adjacent vertices have
set union of cardinality 2m; we color the edge between them with the set
2m ), so
[n]\ (S1∪ S2). Such a set is a subset of [n] of cardinality (
there are p = ( n
2m ) colors. Clearly, from the Sn symmetry, the coloring map
is surjective.

This coloring has the property that if the edge e is incident to vertices v
and w, then the subsets v, w and c(e) of [n] form a partition of n. Hence, for
each edge, the edge’s color and one of the vertices it is incident to determine
the other vertex incident to the edge. Hence, no vertex is incident to two
edges with the same color, and the coloring is proper. Each color occurs the
same number of times and each vertex has the same degree, again due to
the Sn symmetry of the graph.

The degree s of vertex v is the number of subsets of [n] disjoint from s,
(cid:3)

m ). We compute r using r = sq

which is ( n−m

2p = 1

2 ( 2m

m ).

As a special case of Proposition 5.1, we get a uniform edge coloring
of the Petersen graph K5,2. After assignments of orientation we may apply
Proposition 4.9 to deﬁne uniform Lie algebras.
Example 5.2. A uniform Lie algebra of type (5, 10, 3) deﬁned by the uni-
form edge coloring of the Petersen graph K5,2 has basis B = {vi j}1≤i< j≤5∪
{zk}k
k=1 and Lie brackets determined by relations of form [vi j, vkl] =±zm for
all i, j, k, l, m with i < j, k < l and {i, j, k, l, m} = [5].
5.2. Examples deﬁned by Cayley graphs. Let G be a nontrivial group,
and let T ⊆ G be a nonempty set of elements of G all of order 2. The set T
need not be a generating set. Let Cay(G, T ) = (G, E) be the Cayley graph
of G relative to T ; it is a digraph with vertex set G and arc set {(g,tg) :
g ∈ G,t ∈ T}. Since the elements in T all have order two, for all t ∈ T and
all g ∈ G, both (g,tg) and (tg, g) are edges. We identify such pairs with an
undirected edge {g,tg} to view Cay(G, T ) as an undirected graph. Because
the identity of G is not in T, Cay(G, T ) has no loops or multiple edges.
Deﬁne a coloring function c : E → T so that if g ∈ G and t ∈ T, the edge
{g,tg} is assigned the color t.
Proposition 5.3. Let G be a nontrivial group of cardinality q, and let T ⊆ G
be a nonempty set of p ≥ 1 elements of G, all of order 2. Let Cay(G, T )
be the undirected Cayley graph of G relative to T. The function c deﬁned
above deﬁnes a uniform edge coloring on Cay(G, T ) with respect to which
Cay(G, T ) is a uniformly colored graph of type (p, q, q/2) and degree p.
Proof. Clearly there are q vertices. Fix a vertex g and t ∈ T. Since t has
order two, tg 6= g, and there is an edge labelled t between t and tg. That
makes a total of p edges incident to g. Hence, Cay(G, T ) is regular of degree
s = p, and the coloring map is surjective. Because G is a group, there is
exactly one edge colored t that is incident to g. This gives a total of r = q/2
edges labelled t.
(cid:3)
Example 5.4. If we let G be the additive group Z2 × Z2 and let T1 =
{(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)}, then the resulting uniformly colored complete graph

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

21

is the one corresponding to the uniform Lie algebras in Examples 2.6 and
2.7. If we instead take T2 = {(1, 0), (0, 1)}, then we get the uniformly col-
ored cycle graph associated to Example 2.4. Finally, the set T2 = {(1, 0)}
gives the graph K2 + K2 colored with one edge color; the corresponding Lie
algebra is the ﬁve-dimensional Heisenberg algebra h5 as in Example 2.2.

We may let G be any ﬁnite reﬂection group.

Example 5.5. If we let G = S3 and T = {(1 2), (1 3), (2 3)}, then Cay(G, T )
is the Thomsen graph and the coloring described in Proposition 5.3 makes
Cay(G, T ) into a uniform Lie algebra of type (3, 6, 3). The correspond-
ing nine-dimensional uniform Lie algebra is of type (3, 6, 3). Note that the
Thomsen graph is isomorphic to the complete bipartite graph K3,3, and that
elements of odd order are in one partite set of Cay(G, T ) while even ele-
ments are in the other.

We leave it to the reader to conﬁrm that, more generally, if G is the di-
hedral group of order 2p, by taking T to be the set of all reﬂections, we get
a uniform edge coloring on the complete bipartite graph Kp,p. The corre-
sponding 3p-dimensional uniform Lie algebra is of type (p, 2p, p).

5.3. Examples deﬁned by one-factorizations and near-one-factorizations.
Let G = (V, E) be a graph. A factor of G is a subgraph with vertex set V
and edge set E′ ⊆ E. A factorization of G is a set of factors of G so that the
factors are pairwise edge-disjoint and whose union is G. A one-factor is a
factor which is a regular graph of degree one. A one-factorization of G is
a factorization for which each factor is a one-factor. (If G is oriented, these
deﬁnitions extend in the obvious way.) Clearly, a graph on an odd number
of vertices can not have a one-factorization. In this case, the closest thing to
a one-factorization is a near-one-factorization, deﬁned as follows. A set of
edges which covers all but one vertex in a graph is called a near-one-factor.
A decomposition of a graph as the union of near-one-factors is a near-one-
factorization. We may use Proposition 4.3 to deﬁne a uniform edge coloring
of a graph admitting a one-factorization or near-one factorization. Hence,
every one-factorization or near-one-factorization of a graph deﬁnes a class
of associate uniform metric Lie algebras.

Proposition 5.6. Let G be an s-regular graph G with q vertices and m edges.
(1) If q is even, every one-factorization of G deﬁnes a uniformly colored

graph of type (s, q, q/2), and m = sq/2.

(2) If q is odd, every near-one-factorization of G deﬁnes a uniformly

Proof. Proposition 4.3 deﬁnes a uniform edge coloring for a one-factorization
or near-one factorization of a graph. If q is even and G has a one-factorization,

colored graph of type ( sq

22

T. L. PAYNE AND M. SCHROEDER

each factor has q vertices and q/2 edges, so each color occurs r = q/2 times
in such the corresponding coloring. Substituting into 2rp = sq gives p = s.
The number of edges is m = rp = sq/2. If q is odd, and G has a near-one-
factorization, each graph in the decomposition has (q− 1)/2 edges, so each
color occurs r = (q − 1)/2 times in the associated coloring. Substituting
into 2rp = sq gives p = sq/(q− 1). Then m = rp = sq/2.

Let Kn denote the complete graph on n vertices. All complete graphs ad-
mit a one-factorization or a near one-factorization, depending on whether
their order is even or odd. Up to equivalence K5 has a unique near-one-
factorization. This should be known, but we could not ﬁnd a reference. See
[29] for a detailed proof. Alternately, use the fact that by adding a point at
inﬁnity, every near-one-factorization of K5 extends to a one-factorization of
K6, and apply Sylvester’s argument for the uniqueness of one-factorizations
of K6 (up to isomorphism) to get a canonical presentation of near-one-
factorizations of K5 (see [3]).
Example 5.7. Let K5 = (V, E) be the complete graph on 5 vertices in {vi}5
Deﬁne the edge coloring c : E → [5] by

(cid:3)

i=1.

c({e2, e5}) = c({e3, e4}) = 1
c({e4, e5}) = c({e1, e3}) = 2
c({e1, e5}) = c({e2, e4}) = 3
c({e1, e2}) = c({e3, e5}) = 4
c({e1, e4}) = c({e2, e3}) = 5.

Then K5 together with the coloring c is a uniformly colored graph of type
(5, 5, 2) with degree 4.

We will need the next lemma for the proof of Theorem 6.3.

Lemma 5.8. Let n1 and n2 be two associate uniform Lie algebras deﬁned
by the uniformly colored graph in Example 5.7. Then n1 is isomorphic to
n2.
Proof. One choice of orientation of the graph gives the Lie algebra n1 with

[v3, v4] = [v2, v5] = z1, [v4, v5] = [v3, v1] = z2, [v5, v1] = [v4, v2] = z3,

[v1, v2] = [v5, v3] = z4, [v2, v3] = [v1, v4] = z5.

Theorem B of [24] can be used to show that all uniform Lie algebras with
this set of nonzero structure constants are isomorphic to n1 or the Lie alge-
bra n2 with uniform basis {xi}5

i=1 ∪{w j}5

[x1, x2] = [x5, x3] = w4, [x2, x3] = −[x1, x4] = w5.

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

(See Remark 3.8.) But these two Lie algebras are isomorphic through the
isomorphism f
f (x1) = −v2,f (x2) = −v5,f (x3) = −v3,f (x4) = −v1,f (x5) = v4, and

: n2 → n1 deﬁned by

f (w1) = z2,f (w2) = −z5,f (w3) = −z3,f (w4) = z1,f (w5) = z4.

Hence all sign choices yield isomorphic Lie algebras.

(cid:3)

There is an extensive body of research on graph factorizations, one-

factorizations and near-one-factorizations.
Remark 5.9. Graphs may admit inequivalent one-factorizations. For n ≤ 3,
K2n has a single one-factorization up to isomorphism. For all n ≥ 4, K2n has
non-isomorphic one-factorizations. The number F(2n) of nonisomorphic
one-factorizations of K2n grows like lnF(2n) ∼ 2n2 ln(2n) ([4]), showing
that there is a profusion of uniformly colored graphs in higher dimensions.

See [18, 30, 26, 31] for results on classes of graphs admitting one-factorizations,

and counts of nonisomorphic factorizations of K2n for small n.

6. CLASSIFICATION OF UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS OF TYPE (p, q, r)

WITH q ≤ 5

In Theorem 6.3 of this section we classify up to isomorphism all uniform
Lie algebras of type (p, q, r) with q ≤ 5. We begin by establishing some
general classiﬁcation results which will be useful in the proof of Theorem
6.3. First we show that any uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q, r) with p = 1
must be Heisenberg.

Proposition 6.1. Let n be a uniform Lie algebra of type (1, q, r). Then q =
2r and n is isomorphic to the (2r + 1)-dimensional Heisenberg algebra.

The proposition may be proved by using the deﬁnition of uniform Lie
algebra, or by observing that any two-step nilpotent Lie algebra with a one-
dimensional center must be the direct sum of a Heisenberg algebra and an
abelian factor. However, by Part (1) of Proposition 3.2, uniform Lie alge-
bras do not have abelian factors.

Nikolayevsky has classiﬁed the two-step Einstein nilradicals with two-
dimensional center ([21]). See also [15] in which nonsingular two-step Ein-
stein nilradicals with two-dimensional center are classiﬁed. It is not hard to
describe uniform Lie algebra of type (2, q, r) arising from connected graphs.

Proposition 6.2. Let n be a uniform Lie algebra of type (2, q, r). Suppose
that the corresponding uniformly colored graph is connected. Then q =
2r, where r ≥ 2, s = 2, and n and isomorphic to one of the Lie algebras
n(2r + 2) and n′(2r + 2) deﬁned in Example 2.5.

Proof. Let (V, E) be the uniformly colored graph as in the statement of the
proposition. The universal cover of this graph is the inﬁnite line graph T2
uniformly colored with two colors. The only ﬁnite uniformly colored quo-
tients are even cycle graphs with edges colored alternately in two colors.

Theorem B of [24] (see Remark 3.8) can be used to show that all choices
of signs for the structure constants yield either n(2r + 2) or n′(2r + 2). (cid:3)

Now we reach our main classiﬁcation theorem.

Theorem 6.3. Suppose that n is a uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q, r). If
q ≤ 5, then up to Lie algebra isomorphism, n occurs exactly once in Table
1.

Proof. Suppose that n is a uniform Lie algebra of type (p, q, r) with q ≤
5. Let G = (V, E) be the associated uniformly colored regular graph as in
Deﬁnition 4.5. By Proposition 4.6, (V, E) is a regular graph with q vertices

and rp edges. Such graph are classiﬁed; a list of all such graphs is in Table
2.

None of the regular graphs in the table have the same values of p and q,
unless (p, q) = (2, 4). By Corollary 3.5, p and q are algebraic invariants,
so we only need to show that any two algebras in Table 1 arising from the
same graph in Table 2 and having the same value of p are nonisomorphic,
and that any two graphs with (p, q) = (2, 4) are nonisomorphic.

We do a case by case analysis of the graphs in Table 2. We know from
Proposition 3.10 that 2rp = sq, s ≤ p, and p divides |E|. The ﬁrst thing
we do in each case is to use these three constraints to determine a set of
feasible values for p. We then ﬁnd possible uniform edge colorings and the
Lie algebras associated to those colorings.
Case 1. If G = K2, then s = 1 and q = 2. The only possible value for p is
one. By Proposition 6.1, the corresponding uniform Lie algebra is three-
dimensional Heisenberg algebra h3.
Case 2. Suppose that G = K2 +K2, so s = 1 and q = 4. Then p = 1 or p = 2.
If p = 1, then by Proposition 6.1, the corresponding uniform Lie algebra is
ﬁve-dimensional Heisenberg algebra h5. If p = 2, then r = 1 and we have
the algebra with [v1, v2] = ±z1 and [v3, v4] = ±z2. By Proposition 3.9, all
such algebras are isomorphic to h3 ⊕ h3.
Case 3. If G = C3, then s = 2 and q = 3, then p = 3 and r = 1. The under-
lying graph is complete and p = ( q
2 ). By Proposition 3.9, all orientations of
the graph deﬁne isomorphic Lie algebras, and n is isomorphic to f3,2.
Case 4. When G = C4, s = 2 and q = 4. It follows that p = 2 or p = 4.
If p = 2, Proposition 6.2 tells us that we have either the six-dimensional
Lie algebra in Example 2.4, or h3 ⊕ h3 as in Example 3.6. These are not

26

T. L. PAYNE AND M. SCHROEDER

isomorphic, because the Lie algebra in Example 2.4 is irreducible. If p = 4,
then r = 1, and by Proposition 3.9, n is isomorphic to the eight-dimensional
cyclic Lie algebra m(4) as in Examples 2.8 and 4.8.

Case 5. If G = C5, then s = 2 and q = 5, then p = 5. By Proposition 3.9,
all orientations of the graph yield isomorphic Lie algebras. Hence n is iso-
morphic to the cyclic Lie algebra m(5) deﬁned in Example 2.8.

Case 6. If G = K4, then s = 3 and q = 4. Either p = 3 or p = 6. If p = 3, then
each color occurs r = 2 times, and the coloring deﬁnes a one-factorization
of K4. Up to equivalence, there is a unique one-factorization of K4. It yields
uniform Lie algebras with

[v1, v2] = ±z1, [v3, v4] = ±z1, [v1, v3] = ±z2, [v2, v4] = ±z2,

[v1, v4] = ±z3, [v2, v3] = ±z3.

as in the nonisomorphic Lie algebras from Examples 2.6 and 2.7.

We claim that any Lie algebra deﬁned as above is isomorphic to either
the Lie algebra in Example 2.6 or the Lie algebra in Example 2.7. We use
the method described in Remark 3.8 to reduce the problem to considering
four different sign choices which are encoded in the sextuples

s1 = (+, +, +, +, +, +),
s3 = (+, +, +,−, +, +),

s2= (+, +, +, +, +,−),
s4= (+, +, +,−, +,−),

where the order of signs matched with the order of the brackets in Equation
(8). The signs in s3 deﬁne the Heisenberg type Lie algebra in Example 2.6,
while the sign in s2 give the Lie algebra in Example 2.7.

The Lie algebras with signs as in s1 and s4 are both isomorphic to the
Lie algebra in Example 2.7, which has signs as in s2. The change of basis

x1 = v1, x2 = v3, x3 = v2, x4 = v4, w1 = z2, w2 = z1, w3 = z3

converts from the basis {vi}4

j=1 with signs as in s4. Thus, if p = 3, then n is isomorphic to either

the Lie algebra from Example 2.6 or the Lie algebra in 2.7.
If p = 6, then each edge of the graph is a different color. By Proposition

j=1 with signs as in s1 to the basis {xi}4

3.9, n is isomorphic to f4,2.
Case 7. If G = K5, then s = 4 and q = 5, so that p = 5 or p = 10. If p = 5,
then the coloring is a near-one-factorization of K5. Up to equivalence K5
has a unique near-one-factorization. Hence the corresponding undirected

UNIFORM LIE ALGEBRAS AND UNIFORMLY COLORED GRAPHS

27

colored graph is the same as the one described in Example 5.7. By Lemma
5.8, all possible sign choices yield isomorphic Lie algebras. If p = 10, then
p = ( q
2 ), so each edge of the graph is a different color. By Proposition 3.9,
n is isomorphic to f5,2.
