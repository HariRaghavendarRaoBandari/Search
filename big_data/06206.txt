Abstract

For a conformally-coupled scalar ﬁeld we obtain the conformally-related Einstein-Langevin equa-

tions, using appropriate transformations for all the quantities in the equations between two

conformally-related spacetimes.

In particular, we analyze the transformations of the inﬂuence

action, the stress energy tensor, the noise kernel and the dissipation kernel.

In due course the

ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation is also discussed. The analysis in this paper thereby facilitates a

general solution to the Einstein-Langevin equation once the solution of the equation in a simpler,

conformally-related spacetime is known. For example, from the Minkowski solution of Martin and

Verdaguer, those of the Einstein-Langevin equations in conformally-ﬂat spacetimes, especially for

spatially-ﬂat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models, can be readily obtained.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetime developed in the ’70s (e.g., [1, 2]) and ensuing

studies of the eﬀects of quantum matter ﬁelds on spacetime dynamics (semiclassical gravity

theory SCG) (e.g., [3–6]) have provided the framework for important theoretical predictions,

Hawking radiation and the inﬂationary cosmology being two well known examples. Inquires

into the nature and role played by the ﬂuctuations of quantum ﬁelds began in the ’80s (e.g.,

[7, 8]). For the description of the eﬀects (backreaction) of quantum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations on

the spacetime dynamics, the theory of semiclassical stochastic gravity [9] was developed

systematically in the ’90s. The central question asked there is, speciﬁcally, how metric

ﬂuctuations (note, ﬂuctuation is a stochastic function, not perturbation, a deterministic

function) behave through the solutions of the Einstein-Langevin equation (ELE)[10] with

the correlation functions of the quantum stress tensor as source. ELE is an upgrade of the

semiclassical Einstein equation (SCE) with the expectation values of the stress energy tensor

as source to include the (quantum) matter ﬁeld and (classical) gravitational ﬁeld ﬂuctuation

eﬀects. Stochastic gravity theory has been used to provide certain criteria for the validity

of SCG [11], and applied to problems of interest in early universe [12, 13] and black hole

physics [14, 15].

Using stochastic gravity theory to investigate the behavior of the metric ﬂuctuations

involves three stages of work: 1) Computation of the noise kernel, deﬁned as the expectation

value of the stress energy bitensor, for the quantum ﬁeld matter source in the class of curved

spacetime of interest; 2) Derivation of the ELE for the class of spacetimes of interest, with

the background spacetime obtained from the solutions of the SCE; 3) Solutions of the ELE.

A clear demonstratation of these procedures for metric ﬂuctuations in Minkowski spacetime

can be found in [16, 17].

For task 1) expressions of the noise kernel (NK) for various classes of curved spacetimes

have been obtained from direct computations, using the zeta function [18, 19] or point sep-

aration [20] methods, or using the general expression of the NK expressed in terms of the

higher order covariant derivatives of the Green function [21] under certain approximations

[22, 23]. There is a slow yet steady stream of activities in the last decade. Another ap-

proach is to exploit the symmetry relations between diﬀerent classes of spacetimes, such as

the derivation of NKs [25] for spacetimes related by conformal transformations and by the

2

thermalization relation, as ﬁrst proposed by [26]. Our present work continues in this vein

for task 2), namely, using the conformal transformations to derive new ELE from known

ones, such as the ELE in all the spacetimes which are conformally-related to Minkowski,

where the ELE has been obtained earlier [17], and curved spacetimes possessing high degree

of symmetry, where ELE is relatively easy to derive (some such spacetimes are described

in [25]). We shall in future work derive the ELE for the other class of spacetimes relatable

through thermalization transformations. By then one should be suﬃciently equipped to

tackle task 3) proper.

We begin with Section II to obtain the conformal transformation of the inﬂuence action.

In Section III conformally-related stress tensors are obtained [28] including the eﬀect of

the conformal anomaly. We also give a comparison of our results with those of nearly-

ﬂat spacetime that have been obtained earlier by [29–32]. This shows consistency of our

results for the quantum stress tensor via the inﬂuence action method with those via other

methods in earlier works. Then in Section IV we lay out the transformation of the complete

ELE by ﬁnding the appropriate transformations for various quantities in the equation. The

expression for two dissipation kernels in conformally-related spacetime is worked out in

Section V. There a ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation for the relevant case is presented. We

draw the conclusions in Section VI.

II. THE INFLUENCE ACTION

In the theory of stochastic gravity one considers gravity as the system and quantum

ﬁelds as the environment. Stochastic gravity (including quantum ﬂuctuations) is based on

the ELE

Gab[g + h] + Λ(gab − hab) = 8πG(hT ab[g + h]i + ξab[g])

(1)

to linear order in h. Here Gab is the Einstein tensor, Λ is the cosmological constant, hT ab[g +
h]i is the in-in expectation value of quantum ﬁeld stress tensor, and ξab is the stochastic
force induced by quantum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. This equation can be obtained through inﬂuence

functional method or the axiomatic approach as has been shown in [9].

3

For the inﬂuence functional method, the CTP eﬀective action is given by

eiΓ[g+,g−] = eiSg [g+]−iSg[g−]ZCT P

Dφ+Dφ−eiSm[φ+,g+]−iSm[φ−,g−]

= eSg [g+]−iSg[g−]+iSIF [g+,g−]

(2)

(3)

where Sg and Sm are the gravity and quantum ﬁeld actions, respectively. The inﬂuence

action SIF is due to the quantum ﬁeld, which after expansion in terms of g± = g + h± gives

SIF =

−
8 Z d4x d4yp−g(x)p−g(y)∆hab(x)N abcd(x, y)∆hcd(y)
+

i

(4)

where ∆hab ≡ h+ab − h−ab and Σhab ≡ h+ab + h−ab. The detailed forms of the kernels
N abcd(x, y), H abcd(x, y), and K abcd(x, y) can be found in [9]. N abcd(x, y) is the so-called noise

kernel while the antisymmetric part of H abcd(x, y) is related to the dissipation kernel.

It is of interest to seek the conformal transformations between ELEs of conformally-

related spacetimes. This would play a very signiﬁncant role in determining solutions of this

equation from known ones. We begin by considering the conformal transformation of the

inﬂuence action. This proceeds as follows. Under a conformal transformation,

˜gab = e−2ωgab

; ˜φ = eωφ,

(5)

the quantum ﬁeld action Sm will not change if φ is a conformally-coupled scalar ﬁeld. How-

ever, due to the conformal anomaly [3, 28, 33],

Z D ˜φ eiSm[ ˜φ,˜g] = Z Dφ ei(Sm[φ,g]−aP [g,ω]−bQ[g,ω])

where a = 1/1920π2, b = −1/5760π2, and

P [g, ω] = Z d4x√−gn(RabcdRabcd − 2RabRab +

(6)

(7)

Hence the transformation of the inﬂuence action can be seen to be of the form,

SIF [˜g+, ˜g−] = SIF [g+, g−] − aP [g+, ω+] − b Q[g+, ω+] + aP [g−, ω−] + b Q[g−, ω−]

(8)

As from the results in [28], SIF and the further stress tensor obtained from it are renor-

malized. Note the eﬀective actions in [28], as in most earlier work, are of the in-out type

(Schwinger-DeWitt). What we have here is the in-in (Schwinger-Keldysh) version, which

is the physically correct quantity to use for the derivation of real and causal equations of

motion [5].

The conformal transformation of the stress energy tensor takes the form

hT ab[˜g]i = e6ω(cid:0)hT ab[g]i − aEab − bF ab(cid:1)

(15)

Using this transformation closed expressions for the stress energy tensors of conformally

ﬂat spacetimes can be obtained [26]. Since gab is the ﬂat metric, one has

hT ab[˜g]i = e6ωhT ab[g]i −

˜Bab − 2b ˜H ab

(16)

As long as hT ab[g]i is known exactly, either in the Minkowski or the Rindler vacua, one also
has an exact expression for hT ab[˜g]i.

Further comparison can be done for weakly perturbed conformally ﬂat spacetimes with

the results given in [30–32]. From Eq. (15) we have

hT ab[˜g + ˜h]i = e6ω(cid:0)hT ab[η + h]i − aEab[η + h] − bF ab[η + h](cid:1)

To ﬁrst order in h,

hT ab[˜g + ˜h]i = hT ab[˜g]i + hT (1)ab[˜h]i

(17)

Similarly, the ﬁrst order expansion of Bab in Eq. (13) gives

hT (1)ab[˜h]i = a e6ω Z d4x′Hλ(x − x′)A(1)ab[h] − 8a e6ω∂c∂d(cid:0)C (1)cabdω(cid:1)

(27)

which agrees with the result in [31, 32]. Note that in [31, 32] Eq. (27) was obtained from the

general requirements on the stress energy tensor. Here we have derived the same expression

in a more direct manner.

IV. THE EINSTEIN-LANGEVIN EQUATION

After considering the conformal transformation of the stress energy tensor in the last

section, we shall look at the stochastic force ξab, another ingredient of the ELE in Eq. (1).

The two point correlation function of ξab(x) is given by

hξab(x)ξcd(y)i = N abcd(x, y),

(28)

where the brackets denote stochastic average. The noise kernel N abcd(x, y) is also the sym-

metric two point correlation function of the stress energy tensor. It has been the focus of

various works [19, 21–25, 27] on the backreaction of the quantum ﬁeld ﬂuctuations onto the

background spacetime. In particular, in [23] the transformation between the noise kernels

in two conformally-related spacetimes gab and ˜gab are derived. It is given by

˜N abcd(x, y) = e6ω(x)N abcd(x, y)e6ω(y).

(29)

The gravitational part of the ELE can be derived from the gravity action. With renor-

malization taken into account it can be written as

˜Sg[˜g] = Z d4xp−˜g (cid:20) 1

8πG (cid:18)1

2

˜R − Λ(cid:19) + α ˜Ccdef ˜C cdef + β ˜R2(cid:21)

(30)

7

where the parameters G, Λ, α and β are renormalized constants. This action gives rise to
the gravity sector of the semiclassical Einstein equation for metric ˜gab + ˜hab which takes the

form

1

8πG

( ˜Gab[˜g + ˜h] + Λ(˜gab − ˜hab)) − 2(α ˜Aab + β ˜Bab)[˜g + ˜h]

(31)

Using the conformal transformation in Eq. (15) between the stress energy tensors T ab[˜g + ˜h]

and T ab[g + h], the corrresponding ELE for the conformally-related spacetime with metric
˜gab + ˜hab reads

1

8πG

= e6ω(T ab

( ˜Gab[˜g + ˜h] + Λ(˜gab − ˜hab)) − 2(α ˜Aab + β ˜Bab)[˜g + ˜h]
R − aEab − bF ab)[g + h] + 2 ˜ξab

(32)

where Eab and F ab are given by the expressions in Eqs. (11) and (12) respectively, with
(gab, ˜gab) replaced by (gab + hab, ˜gab + ˜hab) .

Assume that ˜gab satisﬁes the semiclassical Einstein equation

1

8πG

( ˜Gab[˜g] + Λ˜gab) − 2(α ˜Aab + β ˜Bab)[˜g] = e6ω(T ab

R − aEab − bF ab)[g].

(33)

Then, to the ﬁrst order in hab or ˜hab = e−2ωhab, the ELE for the conformally-related space-

time can be expressed as

1

8πG

( ˜G(1)ab[˜h] − Λ˜hab) − 2(α ˜A(1)ab + β ˜B(1)ab)[˜h] = e6ω(T (1)ab

R − aE(1)ab − bF (1)ab)[h] + 2 ˜ξab

(34)

In this form, as long as T (1)ab
is known, this equation can be used to solve for the perturbation
˜hab in the background metric ˜gab. One prominent example would be the various Friedmann-

R

Robertson-Walker models. One can analyze the perturbations of a conformally-coupled ﬁeld

of these models just by putting in the corresponding exact quantum stress tensors in the

static Minkowski, Einstein, and open Einstein spacetimes [25, 26]. This will be pursued in

our subsequent works.

As we have discussed in the previous section, the case with spacetime conformal to

Minkowski is particularly simple. The perturbed ELE can be written as

1

8πG

( ˜G(1)ab[˜h] − Λ˜hab) − 2hα ˜A(1)ab +(cid:16)β −

18(cid:17) ˜B(1)abi [˜h]
= a e6ωZ d4x′Hλ(x − x′)A(1)ab[h] − 8a e6ω∂c∂d(cid:0)C (1)cabdω(cid:1)

a

−2b(cid:16)2 ˜C (1)cabd ˜Rcd + ˜H (1)ab(cid:17) + 2 ˜ξab

8

(35)

This equation can be readily applied to the study of perturbations on the spatially-ﬂat

Friedmann universes useful for the problem of structure formation in inﬂationary cosmol-

ogy. As Roura and Verdaguer [12] have shown, the stochastic gravity theory produces results

equivalent to those obtained by quantizing the linear metric perturbations in the conven-

tional approaches (and more notably, what the conventional approaches cannot, such as the

quantized second order perturbations).

V. THE FLUCTUATION-DISSIPATION RELATION

In a general open system the noise and the dissipation kernels are related by the so-called

ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation. For the ELE in Eq. (34) the noise kernel is the correlation

function of the stochastic force ξab, while the dissipation is included in the non-local part of
T (1)ab

. In [16] the dissipation kernel was identiﬁed as the antisymmetric part of the kernel

R

H abcd in Eq. (4), that is,

T (1)ab

R

[h] ∼ Z d4yp−g(y) H abcd

A (x, y)hcd(y) + · · ·

(36)

In [31] Horowitz and Wald proved that the conformal non-invariant (anomaly generating)
part of the T (1)ab
is local. The argument goes as follows. Consider the quantity Dab[g] =
h0in|T ab[g]|0ini−h0out|T ab[g]|0outi. Since Dab is the diﬀerence between two expectation values,
the non-invariant regularization terms added in for them will be cancelled. Hence, Dab is

R

conformal invariant, that is, it will transform with the naive conformal weight,

Dab[˜g] = e6ωDab[g].

(37)

From this equation it follows that

h0in|T ab[˜g]|0ini − e6ωh0in|T ab[g]|0ini = h0out|T ab[˜g]|0outi − e6ωh0out|T ab[g]|0outi

(38)

Due to causality the left hand side of the above equation can only depend on quantities

in the past lightcone, while the right hand side would only depend on those in the future
lightcone. Therefore the diﬀerence h0in|T ab[˜g]|0ini− e6ωh0in|T ab[g]|0ini can only involve local
quantities.

Since the dissipation kernel comes from the nonlocal part of the stress energy tensor, the

integral in Eq. (36) should transform as

Z d4yp−˜g(y) ˜H abcd

A (x, y)˜hcd(y) = e6ω(x)Z d4yp−g(y) H abcd

A (x, y)hcd(y)

(39)

9

With ˜hab = e−2ωhab, we have the conformal transformation for the dissipation kernel,

˜H abcd

A (x, y) = e6ω(x)H abcd

A (x, y)e6ω(y).

(40)

This is the same transformation rule as the noise kernel in Eq. (29). We therefore see that

the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation will be maintained under conformal transformation.

To be more speciﬁc we take the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation in the background space-

time gab to be

N abcd(x, x′) = Z ∞

−∞

dx′′K(x, x′′)H abcd

A (x′′, x′)

(41)

where K(x, x′) is the ﬂuctuation-dissipation kernel. From the conformal transformations

of the noise and the dissipation kernels in Eqs. (29) and (40), we can readily obtain the

ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation in the conformally-related spacetime ˜gab,

˜N abcd(x, x′) = Z ∞

−∞

dx′′ ˜K(x, x′′) ˜H abcd

A (x′′, x′),

where

˜K(x, x′) = e6ω(x)K(x, x′)e−6ω(x′),

is the transformation rule for the ﬂuctuation-dissipation kernel.

(42)

(43)

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

We have obtained in this paper a semiclassical ELE, through conformal transformations

from another one in a conformally-related spacetime. Under the conformal transformation,

anomalous terms [28, 33] will be appended to the inﬂuence action as the path integral

measure is non-invariant. Using this modiﬁed inﬂuence action we are able to derive the

conformal transformation of the in-in expectation value of the quantum stress energy tensor,

which includes the term with the dissipation kernel. Together with the transformation of

the noise kernel proven in [23], we have the transformation properties of all the quantities

in the ELE. At the same time the ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation under this transformation

is attained.

This approach has been developed to facilitate further solution of the ELE from that of

a simpler spacetime. An immediate application would be on conformally-ﬂat spacetimes.

For example, Martin and Verdaguer [17] have given a detailed analysis on the Minkowski

10

case. With their results our approach here will readily give the ELEs for all spatially-ﬂat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universes. When the conformal factor ω(τ ) ∼ −ln(−1/Hτ ),
one has the spatially-ﬂat de Sitter universe which is relevant to issues in the inﬂationary cos-

mological model. Solutions to the ELE will then describe the behavior of metric ﬂuctuations

in the very early universe. (See [13] for recent progress in this direction.)

For the other conformally-ﬂat spacetimes, like the closed and the open Friedmann uni-

verses, it is simpler to start with the Einstein and the open Einstein static spaces separately

since their conformal vacua are diﬀerent [26]. For the noise kernel this is the consideration

in [25]. In addition to these cases the Rindler space will also be very interesting to look at.

With the ELE in static spacetimes at hand, we shall be able to, using the approach in this

paper, to obtain the ELE for all Friedmann universe, ﬂat, closed or open. Subsequently,

with the cosmological perturbation techniques (e.g., in [34]), it is possible to analyze the

evolution of the cosmological perturbations around these background spacetimes with the

quantum backreaction eﬀects included.
