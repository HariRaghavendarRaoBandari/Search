We study wave propagation in interacting Bose liquid, where the short range part of the interaction
between atoms is of a hard core type, and its long range part scales with a distance as a power
law. The cases of Coulomb, dipole-dipole and Van der Waals interaction are considered. We
employ a hydrodynamic approach, based on the exact solution of Lieb-Liniger model, and study the
evolution of a density pulse instantly released from potential trap. We analyze semi-classical Euler
and continuity equations and construct the corresponding Riemann invariants. We supplement
our analysis with numerical calculations and discuss experimental applications for ultacold atom
experiments.

INTRODUCTION

Study of interacting one dimensional systems experi-
enced its renaissance in the last decade. A signiﬁcant
progress was made both on the experimental and the
theoretical sides. The experimental developments were
boosted by new techniques in measurements and fabri-
cation, in the solid state1 and ultra-cold atoms3–5 sys-
tems. The later employ optical traps, allowing an un-
precedented level of control over the system. Tuning the
system in and out of Feshbach resonance determines the
strength of inter-atomic interaction, while changing op-
tical traps controls the conﬁning potential. This allows
to study the systems both in and out of thermal equi-
librium, where many interesting physical eﬀects were ob-
served. Quite remarkably, cold atom experiments can
be performed both with fermionic or bosonic constituen-
cies. This oﬀers an opportunity to further explore the
inﬂuence of a quantum statistics on correlated one dimen-
sional transport, and in particular on the Bose-Fermi du-
ality. The later was originally established for equilibrium
Luttinger liquids (LL), but was considerably extended
in the recent years. This generalization emerged as one
dimensional quantum liquids were studied beyond the
LL paradigm6. The key point of the LL theory is Dirac
spectrum of single particle fermionic excitations. This
amount to linear hydrodynamic description, and in par-
ticular dispersionless wave propagation. A generic single-
particle spectrum, on other hand, leads to a non-linear
quantum hydrodynamic. In other words, ﬁnite curvature
of fermionic spectrum generates an interaction terms be-
tween the bosonic modes. This to be contrasted with
original electrostatic interaction that induces the curva-
ture of the in the bosonic branches of excitations. From
the bosonic point of view the picture is absolutely dual,
as one can (re)-fermionize the problem. In this case the
interaction of the bosonic modes induces the curvature
of the fermionic excitations, while the curvature of the
bosonic spectrum generate electron-electron interaction7.
The emergent Fermi-Bose duality allows for a powerful
techniques, that enable to study the kinetic of interact-

ing Fermi or Bose system. Moreover, in the presence of
a ﬁnite short range interaction, the statistics of the ele-
mentary constituencies plays only a minor role, and the
system is in a universal Fermi-Luttinger liquid regime8.
A particular illustrative example, is a problem of a pulse
evolution, induced by an instant release of a ﬂuid from a
conﬁning potential. Within the semiclassical approxima-
tion the density pulse splits into left- and right-moving
parts, short time after it was created. These parts sep-
arate and move in the opposite directions. If the spec-
trum of single particle excitations were exactly linear, the
shape of the left and right moving pulses would remain
constant. However, any ﬁnite curvature of the single par-
ticle spectrum induces a non-linearity, that leads to a
deformation of the pulse and unavoidably its”overturn”.
While this problem was thoroughly studied for fermionics
ﬂuids7,9–11, much remains unknown for the bosonic ones.
We address this question in the current work. We show
that if the density pulse is suﬃciently weak, the system
is in a universal Fermi-Luttinger regime. Its evolutions is
identical to the one studied in7,10, up to a redeﬁnition of
the bare parameters. For pulses, that are larger than the
energy scale set by a short range interaction, the bosonic
character of elementary particles is important and the
system is in a new regime. Below we study the evolution
of the system in both limits, in the presence of a generic
long range interaction.

The structure of this paper is as follows. We begin our
discussion by formulating the microscopic model, build-
ing on a Lieb-Liniger model. In Sec. II we develop its
hydrodynamic description and construct the correspond-
ing Riemann invariantII A. In Sec.III we analyze the be-
havior of the pulse evolution in the presence of generic
long range interaction. We supplement the analytic ar-
guments with numeric calculation. In Section V we sum-
marize our result and discuss further extensions.

II. HYDRODYNAMIC APPROACH TO

LIEB-LINIGER MODEL

We start our analysys by introducing a microscopic

model, described by the following Hamiltonian

ˆH =

Xi=1(cid:18) ˆp2

(1)

Here Vext is a conﬁning potential and Vint is a two-particle
interaction, that consist of a short and a long range parts

Vint(x) = g′δ(x) + Vlr(x) .

(2)

Let us ﬁrst consider the case where only short range in-
teraction is present (we will relax this assumption later
on).
In the limit the system is described Lieb-Liniger

It is convenient to parametrize the interaction strength
in this model by

Xi<j=1

c =

(4)

that has a dimension of an inverse length. Thus, c = 0
limit corresponds to free bosons, while c → ∞ is the
hard-core or Tonks-Girardeau limit. In this case the den-
sity correlation function of any order coincide with the
one of non-interacting fermions. Even for a ﬁnite val-
ues of interaction strength c the Lieb-Liniger problem
is exactly solvable. The problem of pulse evolution for
this model was recently solved in Ref.14,15. Moreover,
this limit was analyzed in details within the hydrody-
namic approach16–18. Since we are interested in the situ-
ation where both long and short range part of interaction
are present, we consider the known case of Lieb-Liniger
model ﬁrst.

To develop a uniﬁed approach it is convenient to pass
into the collective degrees of freedom, ”bosonizing” the

application of a potential U (x) which is then switched oﬀ at

bosonic Hamiltonian (1). By doing so, we restrict ourself
to the case of the smooth potential trap.
In terms of
hydrodynamic variables the Hamiltonian is given by

ˆH =Z dx(cid:20) m

2

ˆρˆv2 + E(ˆρ) +

ˆρ2
x

8mˆρ(cid:21) .

(5)

Here ˆρ is a density ﬁeld, ˆv is a velocity ﬁeld and E(ˆρ) is
an energy per unit volume.

Now on we limit ourself to quasi-classical accuracy, ne-
glecting the diﬀerence between an operator and its expec-
tation value. The equations of motions of Hamiltonian 5
became the continuity and Euler equations for an ideal
Bose ﬂuid. The replacement of the true ﬁeld theory by
classical equation of motion, is certainly an approxima-
tion. It is justiﬁed under a number of conditions: (a) the
shape of the pulse is suﬃciently smooth; (b) the pulse
contains a large number of particles in it; (c) we consider
the system at time scales shorter than the inelastic scat-
tering time. (d) the long-range part of the interaction is
suﬃciently strong. In this work we will focus on the case
when all the assumptions above are satisﬁed.

Assuming that the hydrodynamic ﬁelds are slow func-
tion of space and time we use an exact solution of Lieb-
Liniger model at equilibrium, for a local energy of the
ﬂuid per unit volume12

Depending on the average density, the strength of the

to replacement of the parameters (i.e.
sound velocity,
eﬀective mass and interaction constants) the evolution
of the pulse is similar to the one found in a fermionic
model10. If the amplitude of the pulse is big, i.e. case
(∆ρ)2/2m ≥ ρg′ the system is a qualitatively new regime,
where bosonic nature of its constituencies is distinct. In
the current work we explore the transition between these
two regimes.

We now proceed with the analysis of the pulse evolu-
tion, ﬁrst limiting ourself to the ﬁnite range interaction.
In this case, as it was shown by Riemann, classical hydro-
dynamic equation unavoidably leads to the formation of
a shock wave. The position of the shock and the behavior
of the solution in its vicinity depend on the ”regulariza-
tion”. In the absence of long-range interaction the regu-
larization arise due to the terms with high order spatial
derivatives in Hamiltonian 5. Away from the shock this
derivatives are small, and can be neglected. Close the
shock, this term start to play a role, stabilizing the solu-
tion, and leading to oscillation in the density and velocity
ﬁelds. This oscillation takes place of the short scale, in-
dicating that the assumptions of a smooth solution do
not hold and hydrodynamic approach is no longer valid.
Therefore, it makes it no sense to study the evolution of
pulse in the hydrodynamic approach unless long range
interaction is present. Before we include this part of the
interaction into consideration, let us stay with a Lieb-
Liniger model a bit longer and calculate the time when
the shock wave is formed and its position. In order to do
it, we construct Riemann invariants.

Here s is sound velocity, determined by

s =

∂ρ(cid:19)S

(18)

(19)

that can be easily evaluated using Eq.(8).

Eq.(18) is highly non-trivial, since it described the mo-
tion of the particles with coordinate x(t), moving in an
unknown velocity and density ﬁelds. However, it greatly
simpliﬁes for the problem of a pulse evolution, once its
left and right moving are separated in space. As it was
rigorously shown by Riemann20, in this case the charac-
teristics are straight lines, see Fig. 2.

Now we construct the Riemann invariant for the Lieb-
Liniger model. For the strong interaction limit (γ ≫ 1)
the pressure is

P (ρ) =

(20)

that correspond to a gas with a polytropic index n = 3.
The sound velocity in this limit is

(√ρ − √ρ0).

(25)

Using this analysis one can easily ﬁnd the time tc when
the shock wave is formed.

It occurs when two the characteristic curves intersect

tc = ∆x/∆s.

(26)

Here ∆x is the width of the pulse, ∆ρ is the diﬀerence
in the density between the pulse and the unperturbed
region, ∆s is the diﬀerence of the sound velocity at the
maximum of the pulse and away from it.

4

Because all three types of interaction depend on a dis-
tance as power, we ﬁrst discuss a generic power law inter-
action V(x) ∼ 1/xα. A competition between interaction
induced dispersion and non-linear terms induces a den-
sity modulations, with a characteristic scale ∆x. The os-
cillations are pronounced in the region, where both terms
are of the same order

v2 ∼ lα−2

0 ∆ρ∆x1−α .

(31)

The relation between the density and the velocity part in
the right moving wave can be found from the condition
J− = 0, and similarly to the left moving pulse. For the
case γ ≫ 1 this estimate yields v ∼ πρ/m, that leads to
the

∆x ∼

(∆ρl0)β , β =

(α − 1)

(32)

in agreement with Ref.10.

In the case γ ≪ 1 similar
estimate yields v ∼ ∆ρ√cρ0/ρ0. The corresponding scale

of oscillation is given by

∆x ∼ l0(cid:18) mρ0

c∆ρl0(cid:19)β

.

(33)

In a time domain, one expects an appearance of a new
pick, that emerges from a bump, approximately each tc.
This estimate holds as long a size of the bump is of the
order of the original one. At times when the size and
the shape are signiﬁcantly deformed, this estimate is no
longer valid.

We now focus on typical cases of inter-atomic inter-
action, starting with Coulomb interaction (α = 1). We
model it by a screened Coulomb potential

V (x) =

1

ml0 (cid:18)

1

√x2 + a2 −

1

√x2 + d2(cid:19) .

(34)

Here a is the transversal size of the trap, and d is the
distance to the screening gate.
In this case, the long
range part of the interaction in the Fourier space is given
by

Vlr(q) =

2
ml0

(K0(qa) − K0(qd) − ln(d/a)) . (35)

Here K0 is modiﬁed Bessel function, and the eﬀective
is g = g′ +
amplitude of the short range potential
2/ml0 ln d/a. The renormalization of the bare value of
the short range interaction g′ occur due to a singularity
of Coulomb potential at small distances.

The hydrodynamic equation can be now simulated on
the computer, leading to the density evolution shown in
the Fig.3 . Comparing the evolution of density proﬁle
in two limiting cases we note, that the pulse for γ ≫ 1,
shown in Fig. 3, has propagated a longer distance that
the one with γ ≪ 1. This corresponds to a bigger sound
velocity in the former limit as expected. However, the
diﬀerence in the distance, that the pulse has propagated,

for γ ≪ 1. One sees that the time of the shock forma-
tion tc is parametrically longer for for weakly interacting
Bosons compared with strongly interacting ones.

III. LONG RANGE INTERACTION

We consider three types of long range interaction, that
are most relevant for the experiments: Coulomb, dipole
and Van der Waals, accounted by

renormalization of the bare value of a short range inter-
action (g′), by a Coulomb potential. The diﬀerence be-

tween the renormolized values of short rage interaction g
is not big. As a result, for Coulomb interaction the sys-
tem remains eﬀectively in the Fermi-Luttinger limit, even

though it was not a case for original Lieb-Liniger model.
The main pick in Fig.3 is followed by an oscillatory tail.
If atoms are neutral, the direct Coulomb interaction
we have just discussed is absent. In this case, the leading
part of a long range interaction is determined by dipole-
diploe interaction (α = 3). Known examples are ultra-
cold chronium21,22 and dysposium23 atoms. Tuned to a
state with a non-zero dipole moment these atoms interact
via

V (x) =

C3

(|x| + a)3 .

In a Fourier space it corresponds to

Vlr(q) = C3q2 ln (qaeγE ) ,

(36)

(37)

and g = g′ + C3
for the renormalized short range in-
a2
teraction strength; γE ≃ 0, 5772 is Euler constant. The
evolution of the pulse in this case is shown in Fig. 4 for
the values of weak and strong values of a bare short range
interaction. One notice a substantial diﬀerence between
the evolution of the liquid with small and large values
of bare interaction.
In the later case, the pulse moves
with a higher speed and the number of oscillations in it
is larger.

Finally, if atoms do posses a dipole moment, but its
direction is not polarized the long range part of interac-
tion is of Van der Waals type (α = 6). This is a situation
where majority of contemporary cold gases belong. Be-
cause this interaction is rather weak, it hardly inﬂuences
a scattering length l0. For this reason this interaction is

usually neglected. However, it play a major role for a
dispersive regularization of the shock waves, as we show
next. In the real space the of Van der Waals interaction
decays as

V (x) = −C6/(x2 + a2)3 .

Passing to q space one ﬁnds

Vlr(q) = +

πC6q2
8a3

(38)

(39)

and g = g′ − 3πC6
8a5 . The results of pulse evolution in this
case are depicted in Fig.5. The diﬀerence between γ ≪ 1
and γ ≫ 1 in this case is stronger pronounced here than
for a dipole interaction, we discussed earlier. The trend
however remains the same. The number of picks in the
oscillatory tail increases with increasing γ, while the am-
plitude of the leading pick remains practically unchanged.
One may note, that Van der Waals interaction induces a
regularization that has the same form as one induced by
a quantum pressure. However, its coeﬃcient is controlled
by the interaction strength and does not vanish in large
density limit. As a result, as long as a condition ∆ρ ≪ ρ
is satisﬁed Van der Walls interaction regularizes shocks
more eﬃciently than the quantum pressure. Interaction
decays with distance slower than 1/x6 induces a regular-
ization with a smaller number of spatial derivatives. In
this case it dominates the quantum pressure term even
stronger.

In addition to density evolution, hydrodynamic equa-
tuions contain the information about the velocity of

quantum ﬂuid in space and time. It is quite reasonable
to dicuss it as well. This is what we do it in the next
section, in the context of interferometry measurements
in Bose liquid.

In the limit of weakly interacting Bose gas (γ ≪ 1) the
life time of bosonic excitations was calculated in Ref.33.
At zero temperature, the life time of a long-wave boson
is given by

INTERFERENCE MEASUREMENTS

The interference measurements probe phase correla-
tion of the Bose-Einstein condensate24–29. The major
steps of such experiment are: (1) a split of a condensate
into two parts, accomplished by changing of a conﬁning
potential or by controlling an internal degree of freedom;
(2) an independent evolution of two parts for a period
of time; (3) an overlap of two parts. The later creates a
matter-wave interference pattern. This pattern is usually
understood in terms of the condensate wave function

(40)

Ψ(x, t) =pρ(x, t)eiθ(x,t) .

The interaction plays a multiple-role in an interferome-
try.
It inﬂuences the dynamics of a condensate, as we
have already seen in Sections II and III. In addition, in-
teraction also leads to a inleastic scattering that destroys
the quantum coherence. Note, that the coherence can be
also destroyed by another mechanisms, for example on
the stage of when the condensate is split30,31, three-body
recombinations32, or by an external noise. In our analy-
sis we assume that these sources of dephasing are weak,
and take into account only the processes that are induced
by the density pulse.

If short range interaction is strong (γ ≫ 1) ,

i.e.
in Tonk-Girardeau limit, the bosonic problem can be
mapped onto the fermionic one.
In this case the zero
temperature inelastic rate is given by 6,8

We see that in the limit of small ∆ρ/ρ∞ ≪ 1 the char-

the shock time tc.

Here q0 = √8mgρ and A is a three-body collision am-
plitude. It is equal to zero in our model, but is present
in a generic case, for example due to excitations of a
high energy transversal modes34. For large pulse, with
∆ρ ∼ q ≫ q0 the inelastic length was calculated in35,

Since in all limits the shock formation time tc remain ﬁ-
nite within integrable Lieb-Liniger model and does not
depend on A these two time scales are independent. As-
suming that the integrability is violated only weakly we
will neglect the inelastic processes altogether.

We now analyze the emerging interference pattern of
the problem of pulse evolution for the limits considered
above. To cast in a conventional form we use a ”conden-
sate” wave function, Eq.(40). Note, that in one dimen-
sion, due to pronounced quantum ﬂuctuation eﬀect the
true long range order does not exist. Nevertheless, one
still can formally bosonize the bosonic theory12,36, that
results in the practically identical model. The bosonic
ﬁeld θ is related to a velocity ﬁeld in the usual way

v(x, t) =

∂xθ(x, t) .

(46)

After this transformation both Euler and continuity
equation are combined into a single non-local Gross-
Pitaveskii equation

Here we deﬁne

Thus the solution of non-local Gross-Pitaevskii equation
(47) is fully equivalent to the non-local hydrodynamic
equations we studied earlier. The proﬁle of the velocity
ﬁeld are shown in Fig.6 for the case of a dipole inter-
action. As we wee, the proﬁles of the velocity ﬁeld is
quite similar to the density. This is what we have ex-
pected, in our previous estimate. Indeed, it follows from
the Riemann invariants for the right (left) moving wave,
the functions ρ and v are dependent. Our numerical sim-
ulations show that on the whole, this picture holds in

the presence of a generic long range interaction. As for
the velocity ﬁeld, the oscillations for large values of γ are
more pronounced than for small γ. The velocity ﬁeld v
enables us to calculate the ﬁeld θ, see Fig.7. As we ex-
pected, picks of the velocity ﬁeld correspond to steps in
the θ-ﬁeld. The later lead to oscillation of the ”conde-
sate” wave function

and the emergence of the interference pattern, shown in
Fig. 8. Note, that the phase diﬀerence in our case is
driven by the non-equilibrium pulse and arises due to
a diﬀerent length particles on crests and troughs of the
wave have passed. By controlling the strength of the
initial pulse one is able to change the pattern, similarly to

changing a magnetic ﬁeld in the conventional Aharonov-
Bohm interferometers.

V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

In this paper we studied the evolution of a smooth den-
sity pulse in a one dimensional Bose liquid, in the pres-
ence of short and long range interaction. At the start
of the evolution the pulse splits into a left and a right
components, that quickly separate and propagate inde-
pendently. Prior to the shock formation at tc, the long
range part of interaction plays a minor role, while short
range part of the interaction determines the enthalpy of
the ﬂuid in accordance with the exact solution of Lieb-

Liniger model. By varying the strength of a short range
interaction γ we were able to explore a variety of regimes,
from Tonk-Girardeau gas (for γ ≫ 1) to weakly interact-
ing Bose gas (for γ ≪ 1).
With a formation of a shock wave, the long range inter-
action starts to compete with the non-linear terms, sta-
bilizing the solution. The tug-of-war between the nonlin-
earity and a long range interaction results in oscillations
of density and velocity ﬁelds. The scale of these oscilla-
tions depends on the type of long range interaction and
the strength of the short range potential (γ).

We have computed the evolution of the density pulse in
this regime numerically, for the cases of Coulomb, dipole-
dipole and Van der Waals interaction. We constructed
the Riemann invariants for the problem and compared
our numerical results with analytic estimates. We found
that the shock formation time (tc), the period of oscil-
lations and the magnitudes of the velocity and density
ﬁelds are in agreement with our estimates. We found
that in all the cases we considered, the interaction in-
duces a regularization that dominates over the quantum
pressure term, in the limit of suﬃciently smooth density

pulse. It implies that the form of the pulse in the long
time limit is controlled by the long range part of the in-
teraction, even in the limit of Van der Waals interaction.
We have also studied an interference pattern of the
matter ﬁeld, induced by a non-equilibrium pulse. After
casting the hydrodynamic equations in terms of non-local
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we computed the phase of the
condensate wave function. The oscillations of the velocity
ﬁeld lead to the kinks in this phase. The later manifest
itself through interference pattern in time domain. Our
predictions can be tested experimentally and we hope
that out work will stimulate such experiments.
