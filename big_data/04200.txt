Phase transitions in a classical Heisenberg spin model of a chiral helimagnet with the
Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction in three dimensions are numerically studied. By using
the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm recently developed for particle and continuous spin systems,
we perform equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations for large systems up to about 106 spins. Without
magnetic ﬁelds, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition with critical exponents of the
three-dimensional XY model, and a uniaxial periodic helical structure emerges in the low temper-
ature region. In the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the axis of the helical structure,
it is found that there exists a critical point on the temperature and magnetic-ﬁeld phase diagram
and that above the critical point the system exhibits a phase transition with strong divergence of
the speciﬁc heat and the uniform magnetic susceptibility.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Frustration and competition between interactions
and/or ﬁelds often induce complicated spin structures
into magnetic materials such as spin ice, magnetic
skyrmion, and spin liquid. Phase transitions and phase
diagrams in magnetic materials driven by various in-
teractions and ﬁelds have been extensively studied in
condensed matter physics and also statistical physics.
Among them, chiral magnets such as MnSi have recently
attracted great interests to experimental and theoreti-
cal studies not only for its fundamental properties but
also for applications [1–9]. Chiral helimagnet is a mag-
netic system in which a uniaxial helical structure emerges
in the low temperature region. The helical structure is
induced by the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction
[10, 11] which is an antisymmetric interaction breaking
a chiral symmetry, and thus, the two same helical struc-
tures with diﬀerent winding directions do not degener-
ate. By a variational analysis of a one-dimensional con-
tinuum model [6–9], it is revealed theoretically that a
chiral magnetic soliton lattice (CSL) is formed with a
ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the axis of the heli-
cal structure, and a continuous phase transition to forced
ferromagnetic phase occurs with increasing the magnetic
ﬁeld. A mean-ﬁeld analysis shows that a phase transition
into the CSL phase occurs at a ﬁnite temperature under
the magnetic ﬁeld [12].

While recent experiments [2, 3] have reported the ex-
istence of the CSL state at ﬁnite temperatures in three
dimensions, ﬁnite-dimensional eﬀects beyond the mean-
ﬁeld theory on the nature of the ﬁnite-temperature phase
transitions of the system are still

absence of magnetic ﬁelds, renormalization-group ap-
proaches [13, 14] predict that the system undergoes a
continuous phase transition with critical exponents of the
ferromagnetic XY model. Another theoretical study [15]
also indicates that the system belongs to the same uni-
versality class of the ferromagnetic XY model. On the
other hand, with the magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the
axis of the helical structure, the system no longer has
any continuous symmetry in the spin space. Therefore,
the nature of a possible phase transition in three dimen-
sions is nontrivial and possibly diﬀerent from the three-
dimensional XY model.

In this paper, we study a three-dimensional classical
Heisenberg spin model of a chiral helimagnet by equilib-
rium Monte Carlo simulations. We especially focus on its
phase transitions and ordering structures in the low tem-
perature region with and without the magnetic ﬁeld. Be-
cause of the competition among the DM interaction, the
symmetric exchange interaction, and the magnetic ﬁeld,
complicated ordering structures emerge in the low tem-
perature region. In particular, there are many CSL states
with diﬀerent numbers of chiral solitons which are sepa-
rated with each other by large energy barrier. Hence, a
transition between the diﬀerent CSL states hardly occurs
by means of conventional Monte Carlo algorithms such
as the Metropolis and the heat-bath algorithm.
In or-
der to reduce the diﬃculty of the slow relaxation, we use
the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm [16–20] which is
a recently proposed rejection-free and eﬃcient algorithm
for equilibrium simulations. This algorithm enables us to
equilibrate quite large systems with more than 106 spins
so as to avoid suﬀering from its strong ﬁnite-size eﬀects
particularly in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld.

This paper is organized as follows.

In Section II we
deﬁne a classical Heisenberg spin model of a chiral he-
limagnet and various physical quantities. The details of
the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm are presented in
Section III. In Section IV, results of our Monte Carlo sim-

ulations are shown, and properties of phase transitions
and ordering structures of the system with and without
a magnetic ﬁeld are discussed. In Section V we discuss a
possible phase diagram and summarize our results.

II. MODEL AND PHYSICAL QUANTITIES

In this paper, we study a classical Heisenberg model
of a chiral helimagnet in a three-dimensional simple
cuboidal lattice. The system is deﬁned by the Hamil-
tonian

H ({Si}) = −J Xhi,ji

Si · Sj − D ·Xi

(Si × Si+ˆy)

Si,

(1)

−h ·Xi

where Si is a unit vector with three components, J is a
positive coupling constant, D = D ˆy is the DM vector,
and h = hˆz is a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the DM
vector D. The summation in the ﬁrst term runs over all
the neighboring pairs of sites, and the other summations
run over all the sites. The lattice on which the system
is deﬁned is a cuboid where the linear size of y direction
is α times as long as x and z directions. The linear size
of x and z directions of the lattice is denoted by L and
the total number of sites is N = αL3. We set α = 8 in
the following of this paper. Periodic boundary conditions
are imposed on x and z directions and a free boundary
condition on y direction.

The second term in the Hamiltonian (1) represents the
Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction [10, 11] which induces
a helical spin structure. In the ground state of the sys-
tem without magnetic ﬁelds, all spins in each x-z plane
align ferromagnetically and the spins in each plane make
a canted angle θ = arctan(D/J) with respect to its near-
est neighbor plane along the DM vector. The wave vec-
tor qchiral corresponding to the helical structure in the
ground state is determined by D/J via

qchiral = arctan(cid:18) D

J (cid:19) ˆy.

(2)

At a ﬁnite temperature, the system undergoes a phase
transition from a paramagnetic phase to a chiral heli-
magnetic phase as temperature decreases. Following the
work by Calvo [15], the system without magnetic ﬁelds
can be exactly mapped onto another system deﬁned by
the Hamiltonian

2

and the summation in the ﬁrst term runs over all the
neighboring pairs of two sites which are in the same x-z
plane. This Hamiltonian (3) for a ﬁnite value of D has
the same symmetry with the XY model, and therefore,
the original system is expected to belong to the same
universality class of the three-dimensional ferromagnetic
XY model [15].

In the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld h perpendicular
to the DM vector, the structure of the ground state is
modulated depending on h = |h|. For 0 < h < hc,
the CSL is formed [9], and all spins are parallel to the
magnetic ﬁeld for h > hc.
In the CSL state at zero
temperature, there are more than one local length scales
such as the distance between two chiral solitons and the
length of one chiral soliton, and hence, multiple wave
vectors are expected to be required to characterize the
CSL structure.

For the chiral helimagnetic system, we deﬁne the wave-
vector-dependent magnetization which captures the heli-
cal structure of the system as

m (q) =

1

N Xi

Si exp(iq · ri),

(5)

where q is a three-component wave vector. The wave-
vector-dependent susceptibility associated with m (q) is
deﬁned as

χ (q) = βN(cid:16)D|m (q)|2E − |hm (q)i|2(cid:17) ,

(6)

where β is an inverse temperature and the bracket h···i
denotes the thermal average. Note that χ (q) is pro-
portional to a Fourier component of the spin correlation
function

C (r) =

1

N Xi

(hSi · Si+ri − hSii · hSi+ri) .

(7)

In particular, the susceptibility with a wave vector q par-
allel to the DM vector D is denoted as χk (q), where
q = |q|. Although the ground state of the system
with no magnetic ﬁelds is obviously characterized by
m (q = qchiral), it is unclear that which q’s character-
ize the structure at ﬁnite temperature with/without a
magnetic ﬁeld h 6= 0. We thus calculate the wave-vector
dependence of χk (q), which yields the wave vectors q0
at which χk (q0) gives a maximum value. By using χ (q),
the wave-vector-dependent ﬁnite-size correlation length
is deﬁned as

H ′ ({Si}) = −J Xhi,ji⊥

Si · Sj −Xi

Si · CSi+ˆy,

(3)

ξL (q) =

1

2 sin (|qmin| /2)s χ (q)

χ (q + qmin) − 1,

(8)

where

√J 2 + D2

C =


J √J 2 + D2 
 ,

where qmin is the minimum wave vector parallel to q.
Similarly to the susceptibility, the ﬁnite-size correlation
length depending on a wave vector q parallel to D is
deﬁned as ξk
L (q), where qmin in Eq. (8) is set to qmin =
(0, 2π/αL, 0).

(4)

We also deﬁne a distribution function of the energy

density e as

P (e) =(cid:28)δ(cid:18)e −

1
N

H ({Si})(cid:19)(cid:29) ,

(9)

which is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. From the
distribution, the speciﬁc heat c is calculated. When the
system exhibits a ﬁrst-order phase transition, the dis-
tribution has a double-peak structure at the transition
temperature.

We study the phase transitions of the system with
D/J = 1 by equilibrium Monte Carlo (MC) simulations
using the event-chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm
[16–20] combined with the heat-bath algorithm, the over-
relaxation updates [21, 22] and the exchange Monte Carlo
method (or parallel tempering) [23]. The details of the
ECMC algorithm in our simulations are presented in the
next section.

III. EVENT-CHAIN MONTE CARLO

ALGORITHM

The ECMC algorithm was originally developed for par-
ticle systems [16–18], and recently applied to continuous
spin systems [19, 20]. In every step of the algorithm, only
one particle (or spin) is moved, and another interacting
particle (or spin) starts to move instead of rejecting a pro-
posal. Thus, a series of local updates called “event chain”
is formed, in which many particles (or spins) are updated
in a cooperative manner. This dynamics breaks the de-
tailed balance condition, but still satisﬁes the global bal-
ance condition. For various systems, the ECMC algo-
rithm outperforms conventional algorithms such as the
Metropolis algorithm [24] and the heat-bath algorithm
[25, 26]. In particular, it is revealed that the algorithm
reduces the value of the dynamical critical exponent z of
the three-dimensional ferromagnetic Heisenberg model to
z ≃ 1 from the conventional value z ≃ 2 [20]. This re-
duction enables us to simulate systems with much larger
degrees of freedom in equilibrium than those attained
with the conventional algorithms previously.

In this algorithm, the state of the system is represented
by ({Si} , U ), where {Si} is the spin conﬁguration and U
is a “lifting parameter.” The lifting parameter U speciﬁes
the current rotation site and the direction vector of the
rotation axis. Explicitly, the lifting parameter is given as
an N × 3 matrix of the form U = ej vT, where ej is an
N -dimensional unit vector with components (ej)k = δj,k
and v is a three-component unit vector. For concrete-
ness, we assume that the Hamiltonian can be written as
a summation of interactions

H ({Si}) =

1

2Xi,j Xa

E(a)

ij (Si, Sj)+Xi,a

E(a)

i

(Si) , (10)

where the suﬃx “a” is the type of interaction. Note that
any decompositions of the Hamiltonian in the form of

3

Eq. (10) are allowed in the following argument. An ele-
mentary step of this algorithm is to propose an inﬁnites-
imal rotation dφ of the moving spin Sj around the axis
v, and to accept the proposal with probability of the fac-
torized Metropolis ﬁlter [18]

and Rv(ϕ) is a rotation matrix around v with an angle ϕ.
Thanks to the factorization, whether the proposal is ac-
cepted can be determined by each factor independently,
i.e., the proposal is accepted only if all the factorized
potentials avoid the rejection. When the proposal is re-
jected by a factor with the potential E(a)
), then
a lifting event occurs and the lifting parameter is updated

In principle, any matrix A is available but a class of A
leading to a simple lifting event is desired in practice.
To make the algorithm into practice, an event-driven ap-
proach [27] is adopted, which allows to move the spins
with a ﬁnite displacement.

In the conventional ECMC algorithm for continuous
spin systems only with isotropic interactions [19, 20] and
a magnetic ﬁeld, the Hamiltonian is decomposed as

Hiso ({Si}) =

1

2Xi Xj∈∂i

Eij (Si, Sj) +Xi

Ei (Si) , (15)

where

Eij (Si, Sj) = −Jij Si · Sj,

Ei (Si) = −h · Si.

d

= −

∆Ekj (ϕ; v)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ϕ=0

for all j, k and v. This relation yields that by choosing
the matrix A in Eq. (13) and Eq. (14) as the identity I,
the lifting matrices are determined as

(Ljk)p,q = δp,q − δj,pδk,q + δj,qδk,p,
(Lj)p,q = δp,q (1 − 2δj,p) ,

(19)

(20)

respectively. These lifting matrices make the lifting pa-
rameter U have one non-zero row, and thus, only a single
spin moves at any time. However, for anisotropic inter-
actions including the DM interaction, Eq. (18) does not
hold in general. In these cases, L(a)
jk depends on the spin
conﬁguration, and the updated lifting parameter L(a)
jk U
has more than one non-zero rows, meaning that multi-
ple spins start to move after a lifting event. Although
we could implement another Monte Carlo algorithm in
which multiple spins move simultaneously [17, 28], we
apply the ECMC algorithm only with the rotation axis
v = ˆy, where Eq. (18) holds for the DM interaction and
thus the single spin update is still kept.
Instead, the
ergodicity condition is not satisﬁed by the ECMC algo-
rithm only with a single rotation axis.
In order to re-
cover the ergodicity condition in the Markov chain, the
over-relaxation and the heat-bath algorithms are com-
bined with this ECMC algorithm. The ECMC algorithm
enables us to sample diﬀerent structures of the system
eﬃciently by inducing cooperative spin updates of the
same x-z plane in each event chain.

IV. RESULT

In this section, we present results of our Monte Carlo
simulations of the system with and without the mag-
netic ﬁeld. The linear size of the system in the simu-
lations ranges from L = 2 (the total number of spins
N = 2 × 16 × 2) to L = 64 (N = 64 × 512 × 64). The
total number of Monte Carlo steps (MCS) in our sim-
ulations is 5 × 104 – 5 × 105 depending on the system
size, where one MCS is deﬁned as N lifting events with
5 over-relaxation sweeps per spin. One heat-bath update

equilibration by conﬁrming that the average values of
physical quantities measured during an interval coincide
with those measured during another interval twice longer
within statistical uncertainty. Error bars are evaluated
by results of multiple independent simulations.

A. Universality class of the system without

magnetic ﬁelds

First, we present the speciﬁc heat c of the system for
various system sizes in Fig. 1. One can see in the ﬁg-
ure that the speciﬁc heat shows a sharp peak at about
T /J ≃ 1.68, and thus, a phase transition is expected
to occur at around this temperature. Around and below
this temperature, the wave-vector-dependent susceptibil-
ity χk (q) has two peaks at q = ±qchiral, see Fig. 2. This
fact is insensitive to the system size in our simulations.
Therefore, the wave vector qchiral also characterizes the
ordering structure of the system at ﬁnite temperature
and m (qchiral) can be considered as an order parameter
of the system.

We show the wave-vector-dependent ﬁnite-size cor-
relation length ξk
L (qchiral) divided by αL in Fig. 3.
One can see in the ﬁgure that each pair of curves for
L (qchiral) /αL and ξk
ξk
2L (qchiral) /2αL intersects at a tem-
perature and that the intersection converges to a certain
temperature point for larger sizes while it slightly shifts
for smaller sizes. This implies that the correlation length
with the wave vector qchiral diverges at a ﬁnite tempera-
ture in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we assume that
ξk
L (qchiral) /αL follows a ﬁnite-size scaling (FSS) form

proposed method based on Bayesian inference [29, 30],
FSS analyses are performed for four sets of the data con-
sisting of three successive system sizes Lmin, 2Lmin and
4Lmin. As shown in Fig. 4, the FSS plot for the data
set with Lmin = 16 works well, yielding that the critical
temperature Tc and the critical exponent ν are estimated
as Tc/J = 1.68672(4) and ν = 0.676(3), respectively.

Using the value of the critical temperature esti-
mated by FSS of the ﬁnite-size correlation length ra-
tio ξk
L (qchiral) /αL, we also perform FSS analyses of the
wave-vector-dependent susceptibility χk (qchiral) for the
same data sets. The susceptibility is assumed to follow a
scaling form

χk (qchiral) = (αL)γ/ν Gh(T − Tc) (αL)1/νi ,

where G is a scaling function and γ is the critical ex-

perature dependence of the susceptibility χk (qchiral) and
the resultant FSS plot. The exponents are estimated as
ν = 0.670(2) and γ = 1.320(4), respectively. The esti-
mated values of the critical temperature and exponents
are shown in Table I. As seen in the table, the values
of the critical exponents approach those of the three-
dimensional ferromagnetic XY model [31] as Lmin in-
creases. We conclude that the system without magnetic
ﬁelds undergoes a phase transition from a paramagnetic
phase to a chiral helimagnetic phase as temperature de-
creases with critical exponents of the three-dimensional
XY model, as predicted in Ref. 13–15.

B. Phase transition under a magnetic ﬁeld

perpendicular to the DM vector

In this subsection, we focus on the eﬀect of a magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the DM vector. The wave-number
dependence of the susceptibility χk (q) at h/J = 0.1,
0.2, and 0.3 for various temperatures and various sizes
is shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. In contrast
to the case without the magnetic ﬁeld shown in Fig. 2,
χk (q) has several peaks at ±q0 and integral multiples of
q0 in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld in the low tem-

6

perature region with q0 being the positive wave number
which gives the largest value of the susceptibility. The
value of q0 for ﬁnite magnetic ﬁelds is signiﬁcantly smaller
than that of qchiral, although the diﬀerence is tiny for
small ﬁelds as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. Furthermore,
not only the largest peaks but also other small peaks
are enhanced with increasing the system size, as seen in
Fig. 7. These indicate that a periodic order, e.g., chiral
soliton lattice (CSL) which cannot be characterized by
a single wave vector emerges at low temperatures in the
thermodynamic limit. The distance between two chiral
solitons in the low temperature region is characterized
by the value of the wave number q0 as ∼ 2π/ |q0|.
In
Fig. 6(c), for instance, one can see that |q0| /2π ∼ 0.1 at
a suﬃciently low temperature for h/J = 0.3, and hence,
the distance between two chiral solitons along the DM
vector is about 10 lattice spacings. Other wave numbers
of the peak in χk (q) in the low temperature region are
considered to characterize shorter length scales within
one chiral soliton.

One may consider naively the order parameter of the
CSL order to be m (q0). The value of q0 weakly de-
pends on temperature and also the values of the wave
numbers of the peaks in ﬁnite systems with the magnetic
ﬁeld slightly deviate from those in the thermodynamic
limit. The latter is due to the fact that the wave number
in ﬁnite-size lattices can take only discrete values. As
discussed above, the existence of the CSL phase charac-
terized by the multiple wave vectors is strongly suggested
at low temperatures. It is, however, diﬃcult to identify
the precise value of q0 in numerical simulations and the
order parameter in the CSL phase.

While the CSL emerges in the presence of the magnetic
ﬁeld, qualitatively diﬀerent behavior is observed in ther-
modynamic quantities at a relatively large magnetic ﬁeld,
particularly at h/J = 0.3 in our study. One of the strik-
ing features is the existence of the sharp peak of χk (0) at
a certain temperature which is not the intrinsic suscepti-
bility conjugated with the CSL order and also the chiral
helimagnetic order parameter. At the temperature, the
speciﬁc heat has a diverging peak simultaneously. We
show in Fig. 8 the system-size dependence of the peak
values of the magnetic susceptibility χk
∗ (0) and the spe-
ciﬁc heat c∗. For h/J = 0.1 and 0.2, the peak values of
χk
∗ (0) and c∗ do not seem to diverge even in the ther-
modynamic limit. This is compatible with the result of
h/J = 0, where the system belongs to the universality
class of the three-dimensional XY model and hence the
critical exponent α is negative. Without the magnetic
ﬁeld, the speciﬁc heat c does not diverge, but shows a
cusp singularity at the critical temperature in the ther-
modynamic limit as the three-dimensional XY model.
When a cusp singularity exists in the speciﬁc heat, its
peak value c∗ scales as [32, 33]

c∗ ≃ c∞

∗ − sLα/ν,

(23)

where c∞
is the peak value of the speciﬁc heat in the
∗
thermodynamic limit and s is a constant. We can see in

the inset of Fig. 8(b) that the peak values c∗ of the system
with h/J = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 have very similar system size
dependence. This fact suggests that the system under
the magnetic ﬁelds also belongs to the universality class
of the three-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model.

In particular, χk

On the other hand, for h/J = 0.3, the peak values
χk
∗ (0) and c∗ show very strong tendencies to diverge in
the thermodynamic limit.
∗ (0) and c∗
at h/J = 0.3 seem to diverge as a power law with L3 or
even faster than a power low in larger system sizes. These
indicate the existence of a critical point (Td, hd) where
0.2 < hd/J < 0.3 on the phase boundary between the
paramagnetic phase and the CSL phase in the magnetic
phase diagram of the system. In other words, the system
is expected to have ﬁnite values of the speciﬁc heat c and
the susceptibility χk (0) at the transition temperature for
h < hd, and presumably belongs to the same universal-
ity class of the system without the magnetic ﬁeld, while
the system undergoes a phase transition at a ﬁnite tem-
perature with the diverging speciﬁc heat c and diverging
magnetic susceptibility χk (0) for h > hd.

A possible explanation of the strong divergence of the
speciﬁc heat found at h/J = 0.3 might be an occurrence
of the ﬁrst-order phase transition. Then, the speciﬁc
heat has a delta-function type divergence at the transi-
tion temperature and the peak value of the speciﬁc heat
is expected to diverge as Ld where d = 3 is the spatial

dimension [34]. Also the energy-density distribution has
two peaks at the transition temperature. In Fig. 9, we
present temperature dependence of the speciﬁc heat c of
the system with h/J = 0.3. One can see in the phase di-
agram that the speciﬁc heat c shows a very sharp peak at
about T /J ≃ 1.445, and the width of the peak becomes
narrower as the system size increases. This is consistent
with the occurrence of the ﬁrst-order transition and the
size dependence of c∗ shown in Fig. 8(b) is marginally
compatible with L3. However, as seen in Fig. 10, the
energy-density distribution function P (e) does not have
a double-peak structure near the transition temperature.
No clear evidence of the ﬁrst-order transition is found
in our numerical results. We could not completely rule
out the possibility of a weak ﬁrst-order transition with
a ﬁnite correlation length at the transition temperature
larger than the largest system size in our simulations.
Therefore, we tentatively conclude that this phase tran-
sition found at h/J = 0.3 is a continuous one. Our results
suggest that the expected universality class has a ratio
of the critical exponents of the speciﬁc heat and the cor-
relation length α/ν > 3, assuming that c∗ of the system
diverges faster than L3 also in larger systems. Unfor-
tunately, we could not determine the critical exponents
of the transition and the precise location of the critical
point (Td, hd), which requires larger scale simulations of
the system.

V. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY

A possible phase diagram of the system is presented
in Fig. 11, where we denote the paramagnetic phase and
the CSL phase as “P” and “CSL”, respectively. The ﬁlled
square at h/J = 0 is estimated by the FSS analysis in
Sec. IV A, and other squares are estimated by the peak
temperature of χk (0) at h/J = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 for L =
64 and at h/J = 0.35 for L = 16. The circle represents
an expected location of the critical point (Td/J, hd/J).

One can see in the phase diagram that the phase
boundary h∂CSL (T ) between the paramagnetic phase
and the CSL phase has a ﬁnite slope, which is compati-
ble with the experimental phase diagram of a chiral heli-
magnet [3]. Imposing diﬀerentiability on the free-energy
density of the inﬁnite system at a point (T0, h∂CSL (T0))
where a second-order phase transition occurs, the ﬁnite
tangent of the phase boundary yields the relation

where ω and χ are the temperature derivative and the
magnetic-ﬁeld derivative of the magnetization parallel to
the ﬁeld, and ∆X = XCLS − XP for any X ∈ {c, χ, ω}
at (T0, h∂CSL (T0)), respectively. If the system under the
magnetic ﬁeld with 0 < h < hd belongs to the univer-
sality class of the three-dimensional ferromagnetic XY
model as discussed above, the speciﬁc heat is continuous
on the phase boundary. In this system for a ﬁxed h < hd,
the uniform susceptibility has a ﬁnite value. Therefore,
Eq. (24) requires ∆ω = 0, meaning that the magnetiza-
tion parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld is smooth at the tran-
sition temperature.

For h > hd, however, the strong divergence is found
in the speciﬁc heat. The diﬀerence ∆c is inﬁnitely large
unless the critical amplitude ratio is accidentally 1 with

the same critical exponent above and below the criti-
cal temperature which may unlikely occur in ﬁnite di-
mensions. Then, the relation of Eq. (24) allows typi-
cally two cases: (i) ∆χ = 0 and ∆ω is ﬁnite and (ii)
∆χ = ∞ and ∆ω = ∞. Our result of the divergence
of χk (0) indicates the latter case. Precisely speaking, χ
is not identical with χk (0) but ∆χ likely diverges when
χk (0) = ∞. This implies that the exponent of the diver-
gence of χk (0) coincides with that of the speciﬁc heat.
Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the magne-
tization is also described by the same singularity at least
either above or below the critical temperature. Thus, the
critical singularity of the speciﬁc heat appears in other
observables unrelated to the critical nature through the
relation of Eq. (24), while in a conventional system where
χ is an order-parameter susceptibility, the relation yields
the scaling relation α + 2β + γ = 2 among the critical
indices.

We should note here that Dzyaloshinskii predicts by
analyzing the one-dimensional continuum model of the
chiral helimagnet in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld
that a continuous phase transition occurs at a ﬁnite tem-
perature [8]. It is also shown that the speciﬁc heat di-
verges from below the transition temperature with a log-
arithmic correction as

c ∝

1

(T∗ − T ) log2 (T∗ − T )

,

(25)

where T∗ is the transition temperature, while no diver-

9

gence of c displays from above T∗.
In this case, ∆c is
inﬁnity at T∗ and the critical exponent of the speciﬁc
heat α′ = 1 below T∗ and α = 0 above T∗. Although no
deﬁnite conclusion can be drawn on the validity of this
peculiar prediction, our numerical data of the speciﬁc
heat is not inconsistent with the asymmetric behavior
between above and below the critical temperature. One
of the main diﬃculties in determining the critical indices
is due to the logarithmic-correction term, which makes
the critical region narrow. Assuming the hyperscaling re-
lation dν = 2 − α and α = 1, the critical exponent of the
correlation length is ν = 1/3, and hence, the peak value
of the speciﬁc heat is expected to diverge as ∼ Lα/ν = L3.
It also coincides with that in the system with the ﬁrst-
order transition. As discussed in IV B, the power-law
divergence of c∗ with L3 is marginally consistent with
our numerical result. Further investigations are required
to clarify the nature of the phase transition of the system
with h > hd and examine the validity of Dzyaloshinskii’s
theory [8].

In summary, we have numerically studied the classical
Heisenberg spin model of a chiral helimagnet in three di-
mensions by equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations using
the event-chain algorithm. We have particularly focused
on its ﬁnite-temperature phase transitions with and with-
out a magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the axis of the he-
lical structure. Without the magnetic ﬁeld, it is shown
by the FSS analysis that the system undergoes a con-
tinuous phase transition with critical exponents of the
three-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model as predicted
by some theoretical studies. It is found that the nature of
phase transitions changes in the presence of the magnetic
ﬁeld, although we speculate that the phase transition
is continuous irrespectively with the value of the mag-
netic ﬁeld h. While the speciﬁc heat c and the magnetic
susceptibility χk (0) have ﬁnite values at the transition
temperature for h/J = 0.1 and 0.2, they diverge at the
transition temperature for h/J = 0.3. Consequently, it
is suggested that the critical point (Td, hd) exists in the
region where 0.2 < hd/J < 0.3 in the phase diagram of
the system. The critical exponents of the phase transi-
tions at and above hd remain unclear, and thus it would
be interesting to reveal the universality class of the phase
transition in high ﬁelds by determining the critical expo-
nents. A promising way for studying the phase structure
might be the method of renormalization group. Our re-
sults suggest that the phase transition, distinct from the
transition at the low ﬁelds, can be detected as a strong
singularity in the speciﬁc heat, uniform susceptibility and
also magnetization curve, which are measurable in exper-
iments. However, the amplitude of the DM interaction
studied in this paper is rather large from viewpoint of
experiments. Thus, the dependence of the critical point
is to be clariﬁed in comparison with the experiments.
