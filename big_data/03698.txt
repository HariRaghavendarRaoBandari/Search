THE SEIBERG-WITTEN EQUATIONS ON END-PERIODIC

MANIFOLDS AND POSITIVE SCALAR CURVATURE METRICS

JIANFENG LIN

Abstract. By studying the Seiberg-Witten equations on end-periodic manifolds, we
give an obstruction on the existence of positive scalar curvature metric on compact
4-manifolds with the same homology as S1 ˆ S3. This obstruction is given in terms
of the relation between the Frøyshov invariant of the generator of H3pX; Zq with the
4-dimensional Casson invariant λSW pXq deﬁned in [6]. Along the way, we develop a
framework that can be useful in further study of the Seiberg-Witten theory on general
end-periodic manifolds.

1. Introduction

A natural question in Riemannian geometry is: When does a closed manifold X admit
a Riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature? (See [8] for a survey on this problem.
We call such manifolds “psc-manifolds”.) The answer is fully understood in the following
two cases:

‚ X is 3-dimensional or less [7];
‚ X is simply connected and 5-dimensional or more [2, 13].

Now consider the case that X is a 4-dimensional psc-manifold. Then we have the

following three constrains on the topology of X:

(i) Suppose X is spin. Then the signature of X (denoted by signpXq) must be zero.

Similar result holds for its covering spaces [3, 5];

(ii) Suppose b3pXq ą 0. Then up to a nonzero multiple, any element of H3pX; Rq can
be represented by an embedded, oriented psc 3-manifold. Similar result holds for its
covering spaces [11];

(iii) Suppose b`

2 pXq ą 1. Then the Seiberg-Witten invariant SW pX, ˆsq must equal 0 for

any spinc structure ˆs. Similar result holds for its covering spaces [12].

In the current paper, we consider the following case:

Assumption 1.1. X is a 4-manifold with the same homology as S1 ˆ S3; the homology
group H3pX; Zq is generated by an embedded 3-manifold Y with b1pY q “ 0.

For such X, condition (i) tells nothing interesting and condition (ii) provides a cobor-
dism between Y and a psc 3-manifold. As for condition (iii), it can not be applied because
the Seiberg-Witten invariants are not well deﬁned (since b`

2 pXq “ 0).

The ﬁrst purpose of the current paper is to obtain a new obstruction of positive scalar
curvature in the direction of (iii). Recall that for X satisfying Assumption 1.1, although

1

Jianfeng Lin

the original Seiberg-Witten invariant is not well deﬁned, there are two other invariants
from the Seiberg-Witten theory:

‚ The 4-dimensional Casson-type invariant λSW pXq, deﬁned by Mrowka-Ruberman-

Saveliev [6];

‚ The Frøyshov invariant hpY, sq, deﬁned by Frøyshov [1], where s is the unique spin
structure on Y that can be extended to a spin structure on X. (It was proved in
[1] that this invariant does not depend on the choice of Y .)

Here is the main theorem of the paper:

Theorem 1.2. Suppose 2λSW pXq ´ hpY, sq ‰ 0. Then X admits no Riemannian metric
with positive scalar curvature.

Remark 1. We conjecture that one should be able to recover Theorem 1.2 as a special case
of Schoen-Yau’s result [11] using monopole Floer homology.

Since it was proved in [6] that the mod-2 reduction of λSW pXq is always ρpY, sq (the

Rohlin invariant of pY, sq), we have the following corollary:

Corollary 1.3. Suppose X is a homology S3ˆS1 with H3pX; Zq generated by an embedded
rational homology sphere Y satisfying

hpY,sq

2 ı ρpY, sq pmod 2q.

Then X admits no Riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature.

This corollary gives a large family of interesting examples of 4-manifolds (with b2 “ 0)

admitting no positive scalar curvature metric.

Example 1.4. Let X be obtained by furling up any homology cobordism from Y “
Σp2, 3, 7q (the Brieskorn sphere) to itself. Then X admits no Riemannian metric with
positive scalar curvature because ρpY q “ 1 and hpY q “ 0.

We summarize the idea in the proof of Theorem 1.2 as follows: Let W be the cobordism

from Y to itself obtained by cutting X along Y . We consider the manifold

Z` “ pp´8, 0s ˆ Y q YY W YY W YY ...

This non-compact manifold has two ends: one is cylindrical and the other one is periodic.
(The word “periodic” indicates the fact that we are gluing togegher inﬁnitely many copies
of the same manifold W . See [14] for the precise deﬁnition.) For a Riemannian metric gX
on X, we can construct, using a cut-oﬀ function, a metric on Z` that equals the a lift of
gX over the periodic-end and restricts to the product metric on the cylindrical end. Now
consider the (suitably perturbed) Seiberg-Witten equations on Z`. More speciﬁcally, let
rbs be a critical point of the Chern-Simons-Dirac functional with certain absolute grading.
We consider the moduli space Mprbs, Z`q of gauge equivalent classes of solutions that
approaches rbs on the cylindrical end and has exponential decay on the periodic end. By
adding end points to the moduli space Mprbs, Z`q, which correspond to “broken solutions”
on Z`, we get the moduli space M`prbs, Z`q, which is a 1-manifold with boundary. Now
we use the assumption that gX has positive scalar curvature. Under this assumption, we

2

Jianfeng Lin

can prove that M`prbs, Z`q is compact. Therefore, the number of points in BM`prbs, Z`q,
counted with sign, should be 0. This actually implies that a certain reducible critical point
ra0s can not be “killed by the boundary map” and hence survives in the monopole Floer
homology. By this argument, we show that hpY, sq ď 2λSWpXq. By the same argument
on ´X, we can also prove hpY, sq ě 2λSWpXq, which completes the proof of Theorem 1.2.
As can be seen from the above discussion, the study of Seiberg-Witten equations on
end-periodic manifolds plays a central role in our argument. We note that the ﬁrst applica-
tion of gauge theory on end-periodic manifolds was given by Taubes [14] in the context of
Donaldson theory, where he proved that the Euclidean space R4 admits uncountable many
exotic smooth structures. However, the Seiberg-Witten theory on end-periodic manifold
is still not well developed. One major diﬃculty in this direction is ﬁnding a reasonable
substitution for the assumption π1pW q “ 1 (which was used in [14]) and prove the com-
pactness theorem under this new assumption. In the current paper, we use the positive
scalar curvature assumption, which tells something interesting but still not general enough.
This motivates the second purpose of the paper: we try to develop a framework that can
be useful in further study of the Seiberg-Witten theory on general end-periodic manifolds.
Actually, all the results (except Lemma 2.21) in Section 2, Section 3 and the appendix are
stated and proved without the positive scalar curvature assumption.

We note that many of the results and proofs in the current paper follow the same line
as Kronheimer-Mrowka’s book [4]. The idea is that: by working with suitably weighted
Sobolev spaces, one can treat the non-compact manifold

X` “ W YY W YY ...

as a compact manifold whose signature equals the correction term ´wpX, 0, gX q (see Sub-
section 2.4).

The precise statements of all the results used in the current paper will be given. How-
ever, to keep the length of the paper somehow under control, we will omit the proofs that
are word by word translations from the corresponding parts of [4]. In order to help the
reader to follow the argument, we will always give the precise reference of the omitted
details. From now on, we will refer to [4] as the book.

The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of the
monopole Floer homology, the Frøyshov invariant hpY, sq and the 4-dimensional Casson
invariant λSWpXq. We will also review and prove some results about linear analysis on
end-periodic manifolds. In Section 3, we start setting up the gauge theory on end-periodic
manifolds and deﬁne the moduli spaces. In Section 4, we prove the compactness result
under the positive scalar curvature assumption. In Section 5, we will put all the pieces
together and ﬁnish the proof of Theorem 1.2. In the appendix, we prove (using Fourier-
Laplace transformation) Proposition 2.15, which states the uniqueness and existence of the
solution of the Laplace equation on end-periodic manifolds. This may be of independent
interest for some readers.

their expertise in several inspiring discussions. The author is especially grateful to Clif-
ford Taubes for suggesting the idea of proof of Lemma 4.3 (the key estimate in Section 4)
and Terence Tao for providing an alternative proof of Lemma A.5. Corollary 1.3 was also
proved by Daniel Ruberman [9] using Schoen-Yau’s minimal surface result.

During the preparation of the current paper, the author noticed that a diﬀerent version
of compactness theorem for Seiberg-Witten equations over manifolds with periodic ends
of positive scalar curvature was proved earlier in Diogo Veloso’s thesis [15]. A diﬀerent
type of Hodge decomposition for such manifolds was also studied there.

2. Preliminaries

2.1. The set up and the notations. Let X connected, oriented, smooth 4-manifold
satisfying the condition

H1pX; Zq – Z, H2pX; Zq – 0.

In other words, X is a homology S1 ˆ S3. We further assume that H3pX; Zq is generated
by an embedded rational homology 3-sphere Y . (This is not always the case.) We ﬁx
a homology orientation of X by ﬁxing a generator r1s P H1pX; Zq. This induces an
orientation on Y by requiring that r1s Y rY s “ rXs. Let W be the cobordism from Y to
itself obtained from cutting X open along Y . The inﬁnite cyclic covering space of X has
a decomposition

˜X “ ... YY W´1 YY W0 YY W1 Y ... with all Wn – W.

We choose a lift of Y to ˜X and still call it Y . We let

be one of the two components of ˜XzY .

X` “ W0 YY W1 YY W2 Y ...

Notation. In the current paper, we will use Y to denote the disjoint union and use YY
to denote the result of gluing two manifolds along their common boundary Y .

There are two spin structures on X. We pick one of them and denote it by ˆs. It induces
spin structures on the various manifolds we constructed so far. In particular, we have an
induced spin structure on Y and we denote it by s. It is not hard to see that s does not
depend on the choice of ˆs. These spin structures will be ﬁxed through out the paper and
we will suppress them from most of our notations. We denote by S` and S´ the positive
and negative spinor bundles over various 4-manifold. The spin connection over 4-manifolds
are all denoted by A0. For the 3-manifold Y , we denote the spinor bundle by S and the
spin connection by B0. In both dimensions, we write ρ for the Cliﬀord multiplication.

Other than ˜X and X`, we also consider the following two (non-compact) spin 4-

manifolds

M` :“ M YY X` and Z` :“ Z YY X`,

where Z “ p´8, 0s ˆ Y and M is a compact spin 4-manifold bounded by pY, sq. By
doing surgeries along loops in M , we can assume that b1pMq “ 0. We denote by ¯M the
orientation reversal of M .

Now we specify Riemannian metrics on these manifolds: Let gX be a metric on X. We

consider a harmonic map

satisfying

f : X Ñ S1 – R{Z

(1)

It was proved in [10] that for a generic choice of gX, the Dirac operator

f ˚pdθq “ r1s P H 1pX; Zq.

{D

`
A : L2

1pX; S`q Ñ L2pX; S´q,

associated to the connection A “ A0 ` ia ¨ f ˚pdθq for any a P R, has trivial kernel. We
call such metric “admissible metric”.

Assumption 2.1. Throughout this paper, we ﬁx a choice of admissible metric gX.

Remark 2. By the Weitzenb¨ock formula, any metric with positive scalar curvature is
admissible. However, we will not impose this positive scalar curvature condition until
Section 4.

Let g ˜X be the lift of gX on ˜X and gY be an arbitrary metric on Y . Using a cut-oﬀ
function, we can construct a metric gX` on X` which is isomorphic to the product metric
r0, 3s ˆ gY near the boundary (with t0u ˆ Y identiﬁed with BX`) and whose restriction
on X`zW0 equals g ˜X. Let gM be a metric on M isomorphic to the product metric near
the boundary. By gluing gM and gX` together, we get a metric gM` on M`. Similarly, we
obtain the metric gZ ` on Z ` by gluing the metric gX` together with the product metric
on Z.

2.2. The monopole Floer homology and the Frøyshov invariant. In this subsec-
tion, we brieﬂy review the deﬁnition of the monopole Floer homology and the Frøyshov
invariant. For details, we refer to the book and [1].

Let k ě 3 be an integer ﬁxed throughout the paper. To begin with, we deﬁne

put the quotation marks here because vσ

We call the perturbation q admissible if all critical points of vσ
q are nondegenerate and the
moduli spaces of ﬂow lines connecting them are regular. (See Page 411 of the book for an
exact deﬁnition.) Under this admissibility condition, the set C of critical points of vσ
q is
discrete and can be decomposed into the disjoint union of three subsets:

‚ Co: the set of irreducible critical points;
‚ Cs: the set of reducible, boundary stable critical points (i.e., reducible critical

points where vσ

q points outside the boundary);

‚ Cu: the set of reducible, boundary unstable critical points (i.e., reducible critical

points where vσ

q points inside the boundary).

respectively.

The monopole Floer homologies ĘHMpY, s; Qq, ~HMpY, s; Qq and zHMpY, s; Qq are deﬁned
Our main concern will beĘHMpY, s; Qq and~HMpY, s; Qq. To give the precise deﬁnitions,

we ﬁrst recall that a two-element set Λprbsq (called the orientation set) can be associated
to each rbs P C (see Section 20.3 of the book). After making a choice of preferred element
χprbsq P Λprbsq for each rbs, we can canonically orient the moduli spaces of trajectories
connecting them. Now let C o (resp. C u and C s) be a vector space over Q with basis terbsu
indexed by elements rbs in Co (resp. Cs and Cu). We deﬁne the linear maps

by the formulae

o : C o Ñ C o,

and so on, where the integer # ˘Mprbs, rb1sq counts (with sign) the number of points in
˘Mprbs, rb1sq (the moduli space of Seiberg-Witten trajectories going from rbs to rcs) that
has dimension 0.

By considering the number # ˘Mredprbs, rb1sq instead (i.e., only counting reducible tra-

jectories), we can similarly deﬁne the linear maps
¯Bs
u : C s Ñ C u,
¯Bu
u : C u Ñ C u.

¯Bs
s : C s Ñ C s,
¯Bu
s : C u Ñ C s,

(We note that ¯Bu

The following deﬁnition was given as Deﬁnition 22.1.7 of the book.

Deﬁnition 2.2. The monopole Floer homology groups ĘHM ˚pY, s; Qq and ~HM ˚pY, s; Qq

respectively. There is a natural map i˚ : ĘHM ˚pY, s; Qq Ñ ~HM ˚pY, s; Qq induced by the

chain map i : ¯C Ñ ˇC deﬁned as

To each rbs P C, we can assign a rational number grQprbsq (called the absolute grading)
as follows (see Deﬁnition 28.3.1 of the book): Let grpM, rbsq be the “relative M -grading”
of rbs. This number describes the expected dimension of the Seiberg-Witten moduli space
on the manifold M ˚ “ M YY pr0, `8q ˆ Y q with limit rbs. It was proved in the book that
the quantity

Remark 3. In (6), we use grpM, rbsq instead of grpra0s, MzB4, rbsq as in the book. Here
ra0s denotes the ﬁrst boundary stable critical point in Bσ
k´1{2pS3q. These two gradings
satisfy the relation (see Lemma 27.4.2 of the book)

grpM, rbsq “ grpB4, ra0sq ` grpra0s, MzB4, rbsq “ ´1 ` grpra0s, MzB4, rbsq.

This explains the extra term “´1” in our formula.

Remark 4. In general, one needs to specify a connected component of Bσ
k pMq (the blown-
up quotient conﬁguration space of M ) to deﬁne the relative M -grading. However, in our
case the space Bσ

k pMq is connected since b1pY q “ 0.

Deﬁnition 2.3. [1] The Frøyshov invariant is deﬁned as

The following lemma was proved in [1] (in a (possibly) diﬀerent version of monopole

Floer homology). The proof can be easily adapted to the version used in the book.

Lemma 2.4. For any rational homology sphere Y and any spinc structure s on Y , we
have hp´Y, sq “ ´ hpY, sq.

Deﬁnition 2.5. An admissible perturbation q is called a “nice perturbation” if q “ 0
when restricted to Cred

k´1{2pY q.

Remark 5. Since the tangent bundle of Ck´1{2pY q is trivial with ﬁber

L2
k´1{2pY ; iRq ‘ L2

k´1{2pY ; Sq,

we can write the perturbation q as pq0, q1q, where q0 denotes the connection component
and q1 denotes the spinor component. Note that by the gauge invariance, the restriction
k´1{2pY q is always 0. Therefore, an admissible perturbation q is nice if and only
of q1 to Cred
if q0 “ 0 when restricted to Cred

k´1{2pY q.

Under the assumption that q is nice, there is only one reducible critical point downstairs
(up to gauge transformation), which is just pB0, 0q. As for the critical points upstairs, the
sets Cu and Cs can be described explicitly as follows: Consider the self-adjoint operator

{Dq,B0 : L2

k´1{2pY ; Sq Ñ L2

k´3{2pY ; Sq

(7)

Since q is admissible, 0 is not an eigenvalue of {Dq,B0 and all eigenvalues have multiplicity
1 (see Proposition 12.2.5 of the book). We arrange the eigenvalues λ˚ so that

Ψ ÞÑ {DB0Ψ ` DpB0,0qq1p0, Ψq.

...λ´2 ă λ´1 ă 0 ă λ0 ă λ1 ă ...

For each i, we pick an eigenvector ψi with eigenvalue λi and }ψi}L2 “ 1. We let rais “
rpB0, 0, ψiqs. By Proposition 10.3.1 of the book, we have

Cs “ trais| i ě 0u, Cu “ trais| i ă 0u.

From now on, we always use ra˚s to denote these reducible critical points. Note that
grQpraisq ´ grQprai´1sq equals 1 when i “ 0 and equals 2 otherwise.

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let q be a nice pertrubation. The height of q is deﬁned as

htpqq “ grQpra0sq.

In other words, the height is deﬁned to be the absolute grading of the lowest boundary
stable critical point.

Proof. Let tψn| n P Zě0u be a complete, orthonormal set of eigenvectors of {DB0. Let the

consider the perturbed Dirac operator {Dq1,B0 (see (7)). Its eigenvalues are of the form

One can prove that fn is invariant under the action of Gk`1{2pY q. We denote by qn the
formal gradient of fn. A simple calculation shows that

Note that the number ´ indC Dq1 ´ signpM q
always belongs to mpY, sq. Moreover, as we
varies tcnu, this number changes by the spectral ﬂow of {Dq1,B0. Therefore, by choosing
suitable tcnu, we may assume that

Under this perturbation q1, the reducible critical points are just rpB0, 0, ψnqs with n ě 0.
All of them are non-degenerate by [4, Proposition 12.2.5]. Therefore, by the compactness
result of the critical points, we can ﬁnd ǫ ą 0 such that the gauge invariant open subset

contains no irreducible critical point. Now consider the Banach space

where P is the large Banach space of tame perturbations constructed in Theorem 11.6.1 of

q2 P PpUpǫqq such that the perturbation q “ q2 ` q1 is admissible. Since both q2 and q1
k´1{2pY q, the perturbation q is nice. Moreover, since q2 vanishes on Upǫq, we

2.3. Linear analysis on end-periodic manifolds. In this subsection, we will set up
the appropriate Sobolev spaces on end-periodic manifolds and review the related Fredholm
theory. Our construction is inspired from [14] and [6].

Let E be an end-periodic bundle (over ˜X, X`, M` or Z`) equipped with an end-periodic
metric | ¨ | and an end-periodic connection ∇ (see [14] for deﬁnition). For any j, p P Zě0,
we can deﬁne the unweighted Sobolev norm of a smooth section s in the usual way:

}s}Lp

j

:“ p

j
Σ

i“0ż |∇piqs|pd volq

p .

(11)

(We can also deﬁne the Lp

j norm for negative j using integration.)

Remark 7. Other then a trivial real or complex line bundle, which we denote by R, C
respectively, two other types of end-periodic bundle will be considered: the spinor bundle
S˘ (associated to spin structures) and the bundle of diﬀerential forms. Both of them have
a canonical metric. As for the connection, we use the spin connection for the former and
the Levi-Civita connection for the latter.

In general, the diﬀerential operators that we will consider do not have Fredholm proper-
ties under the norms deﬁned in 11. Therefore, we need to use the weighted Sobolev norms
instead. To deﬁne them, recall that we have a harmonic map f : X Ñ S1 corresponding
to a generator of H 1pX; Zq. We lift f to a function ˜f : ˜X Ñ R satisfying

f ´1pr´1, 1sq Ă NY

n“´N

Wn for some N " 0.

Now consider the following smooth cut-oﬀ functions:

‚ τ0 : ˜X Ñ r0, `8q: a function that equals |f | on ˜Xz NY
‚ τ1 : X` Ñ r0, `8q: the restriction of τ0;
‚ τ2 : M` Ñ r0, `8q: an extension of τ1;
‚ τ3 : Z` Ñ r0, `8q: an extension of τ1 with the property that

Deﬁnition 2.10. For δ P R, j P Z, p P Zě0, we deﬁne the weighted Sobolev norm of a
smooth section s of E in diﬀerent ways depending on the underlying manifold:

‚ Over X`, we set }s}Lp
‚ Over M`, we set }s}Lp
‚ Over ˜X, we set }s}Lp
‚ Over Z`, we set }s}Lp

j,δpM`; Eq, L2

j;´δ,δp ˜X; Eq and L2

j;´δ, δpZ`; Eq.

We remove j from our notations when it equals 0. We sometimes also suppress the bundle
E when it is clear from the context.

The following lemma is a straightforward corollary of [14, Lemma 5.2]. It asserts that
one can control the weighted Sobolev norm of a function using the weighted Sobolev norm
of its derivative. (Although [14] only stated the result for smooth functions, we can prove
the general case easily using standard arguments, i.e., approximating a Sobolev function
by smooth functions.)

Lemma 2.11. For any δ ą 0, j ě 0, we can ﬁnd a positive constant C with the following
signiﬁcance:

(1) For any u P L2

Next, we summarize the Sobolev embedding and multiplication theorems. We focus
on the manifold X` (although similar results holds other manifolds) because that will
be our main concern. The proofs are straightforwardly adapted from the unweighted
case (Theorem 13.2.1 and Theorem 13.2.2 of the book) and the cylindrical end case ([?,
Proposition 2.9, Proposition 2.10]) so we omit them.

Proposition 2.12. Let E be an end-periodic bundle over X`. There is a continuous
inclusion

Lp
j,δpX`; Eq Ñ Lq

l,δ1pX`; Eq

for j ě l, δ ě δ1 ě 0, p ď q and pj ´ 4{pq ě pl ´ 4{qq. This embedding is compact when
j ą l, δ ą δ1 and pj ´ 4{pq ą pl ´ 4{qq.
Proposition 2.13. Let E, F be two end-periodic bundles over X`. Suppose δ ` δ1 ě
δ2, j, l ě m and 1{p ` 1{q ě 1{r, with δ, δ1, δ2 ě 0 and p, q, r ą 1. Then the multiplication

Lp
j,δpX`; Eq ˆ Lq

l,δ1pX`; F q Ñ Lr

m,δ2pX`; E b F q

is continuous in any of the following three cases:
(1) (a) pj ´ 4{pq ` pl ´ 4{qq ě m ´ 4{r, and

(b) j ´ 4{p ă 0, and

12

(c) l ´ 4{q ă 0;
or

(2) (a) mintj ´ 4{p, l ´ 4{qu ě m ´ 4{r, and

(b) either j ´ 4{p ą 0 or l ´ n{q ą 0;
or

(3) (a) mintj ´ 4{p, l ´ 4{qu ą m ´ 4{r, and

(b) either j ´ 4{p “ 0 or l ´ 4{q “ 0.

When the map is continuous, it is a compact operator as a function of second variable for
ﬁxed ﬁrst variable provided l ą m and l ´ 4{q ą m ´ 4{r.

The following corollary will be very useful because the diﬀerential operators we are
going to consider can often be composed into the sum of a ﬁrst-order, linear operator with
a zeroth-order, quadratic operator.

Corollary 2.14. For any j ą 2, δ ą 0, the multiplication map

L2

j,δpX`; Eq ˆ L2

j,δpX`; F q Ñ L2

j´1,δpX`; E b F q

is compact.

Proof. By Proposition 2.13, this map factors through the natural inclusion

L2

j,2δpX`; E b F q Ñ L2

j´1,δpX`; E b F q,

which is compact by Proposition 2.12.

(cid:3)

Now we start discussing the related Fredholm theory.

Proposition 2.15. There exists a small δ0 ą 0 such that for any j P Zě0 and δ P p0, δ0q,
we have the following results:

(i) The operator

∆p ˜X; ´δ, δq : L2

j`2;´δ,δp ˜X; Rq Ñ L2

j;´δ,δp ˜X; Rq

is a Fredholm operator with trivial kernel and two dimensional cokernel. The same
result holds for the manifold Z`.

(ii) The operator

ward normal vector on the boundary.

Proposition 2.15 will be proved in the appendix.

Lemma 2.16. There exists a constant δ1 P p0, δ0q such that for any j P Zě0 and δ P p0, δ1q,
we have the following results:

j`1{2pY ; T ˚Y q X ker d˚ of
identiﬁed with R. Here C ` (resp. C ´) is the closure in L2
the space spanned by the eigenvectors of ˚d with positive (resp. negative) eigenvalues
and

π` : L2
is the projection with kernel C ´.

j`1{2pY ; iT ˚Y q Ñ C `

Now assume δ P p0, δ0q, where δ0 is the constant in Proposition 2.15. By Lemma 2.11, we
also have

(13)
Using this identiﬁcation and integration by part, we can show that ∆u P V2 for any u P V1.
In other words, we have a well deﬁned operator

j`2;´δ,δpZ`; Rq ‘ R ‘ Rτ4.

V1 “ L2

∆ : V1 Ñ V2.

Comparing the domain and target of this operator with the one in Proposition 2.15 (1),
we see that it is a Fredholm operator with index 1. To ﬁnish the proof, we just need to

14

Jianfeng Lin

prove kernel of ∆ consists only of constant functions. This is a simple consequence of the
maximum principle, noticing that all functions in V1 are bounded (because of (13)).

(ii) Consider the operator
d` : L2

j`1,δpM`; T ˚M`q Ñ L2

j,δpM`; ^2

`T ˚M`q.

By [14, Proposition 5.1], when δ1 ą 0 is small enough, both the kernel and the image of
this operator (which we denote by V3 and V4 respectively) are closed with the following
properties:

V3 – L2

j`2,δpM`; Rq : du Ø u;

(14)

(15)

By (14), the operator

V3 Ñ L2

j´1,δpM`; Rq : α ÞÑ d˚α.

is essentially the same with the operator ∆pM`, δq in Proposition 2.15, which is Fredholm
with index ´1. This implies that the operator

j,δpM`; T ˚M`q Ñ L2
L2

j´1,δpM`; Rq ‘ V4 : α ÞÑ pd˚α, d`αq

is also Fredholm with the same index. Therefore, by (15), the operator

L2

j,δpM`; Rq ‘ L2

j,δpM`; ^2

`T ˚M`q : α ÞÑ pd˚α, d`αq

2 pMq ` 1q.

(iii) To apply the excision principle of the index, we consider the manifold M´ “

Z YY ¯M . (Recall that ¯M is the orentation reversal of M .) We choose a function

τ : M´ Ñ r0, `8q with τpt, yq “ |t|, @pt, yq P p´8, ´1s ˆ Y

and deﬁne the weighted Sobolev norm of a section s over M´ as

Having proved this fact, we are left to show that the kernel is trivial. Suppose we have

Integrating by part, we get dα “ 0. Since H 1pZ`; Rq “ 0, we have α “ du for some

deﬁned by the same formula as (12). By Lemma 24.8.1 of the book, Dp ¯M q is a Fredholm
operator with index ´b`p ¯Mq ´ 1. We note that the boundary of ¯M is ´Y while the
boundary of the manifold in that Lemma is Y , this explains the reason we use C ` while
the book use C ´. We also note that the additional term “´1” in our index formula comes
from the 1-dimensional cokernel of the map

we can prove that DpX`q is Fredholm with index ´1. Now suppose α P ker DpX`q. Then
by the integration by part argument on page 502 of the book, we can prove dα “ 0.
Since H 1pX`; Rq “ 0, we have α “ df for some local L2
j`1-function f . By Lemma 2.11,
ă 8 after adding some constant function. Then f satisﬁes
we can assume }f }L2
∆f “ 0, xdf, ~vy “ 0. By Lemma 2.15, we see that f (hence also α) equals 0. We have
proved that the kernel is trivial, which implies that the cokernel is 1-dimensional. Using
integration by part again, one can easily see that a necessary condition for an element

we have a canonical isomorphism

Now we study the Fredholm properties related to the linearized Seiberg-Witten equa-
tions. Recall that we chose an “admissible metric” gX on X (see Assumption 2.1). Under
this assumption, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 2.17 ([6]). There exists a number δ2 ą 0 such that for any δ P p´δ2, δ2q, j P
Zě0, the end-periodic Dirac operator

`
A0 : L2

16

Jianfeng Lin

To end this subsection, let us consider the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer boundary problem on
the end-periodic manifold X`. This will be essential in our study of local structure of the
Seiberg-Witten moduli space. To simplify our notation, we denote the following bundles
over X`

iT ˚X` ‘ S` and ipR ‘ ^2

`T ˚X`q ‘ S´

respectively by E1 and E2. We also write F1 for the bundle ipR ‘ T ˚Y q ‘ S over Y .

Recall that k is a ﬁxed integer greater than 2. First consider the linear operator

in L2

Proof. We consider the following two operators:

‚ The operator over ¯M

where r ¯M is the restriction map deﬁned similarly as r;

By Proposition 17.2.5 of the book, Lemma 2.16 and Proposition 2.17, both of these two
operators are Fredholm. Note that they correspond to the operator D0 ‘ pp1 ´ Πq ˝ rq on
X`. We can prove the Fredholm property of D0 ‘ pp1 ´ Πq ˝ rq using standard parametrix
patching argument (see Page 245 of the book). Since the embedding L2
j´1,δ is
compact, the operator D ‘ pp1 ´ Πq ˝ rq is a compact perturbation of D0 ‘ pp1 ´ Πq ˝ rq
and we conclude that D ‘ pp1 ´ Πq ˝ rq is also Fredholm. To prove the second part of the
Proposition, we multiply the sequence tuiu by a bump function β supporting near BX`
and follow the argument on Page 304 of the book.

where β1 is an imaged valued one form on M` that equals the pull back of β when restricted

Theorem 2.19 ([6]). The number #MpX, gX , βq ´ wpX, gX , βq does not depend on the
choice of regular pair pgX , βq and hence is an invariant of the manifold of X, which we
deﬁne as λSWpXq; morveover, the reduction of λSWpXq modulo 2 is the Rohlin invariant
of X.

Lemma 2.20. Suppose gX is a metric with positive scalar curvature. Then the pair pgX , 0q

Proof. This is a simple consequence of the Weitzenb¨ock formula.

Lemma 2.21. Suppose X admits a metric gX with positive scalar curvature. Then we
have λSWpXq “ ´λSWp´Xq.

Notice that

signpMq ` signp ¯Mq “ signpM YY ¯Mq “ 0.

By an excision argument relating indices of the Dirac operator on M` Y ¯M` (where ¯M`
denotes the orientation reversal of M`) and the Dirac operator on pM YY ¯M q Y ˜X, we get

is the (unperturbed) Dirac operator on ˜X. As in the proof of [6, Proposition 5.4], this
operator has index 0. Therefore, we have proved the lemma.
(cid:3)

Remark 8. It was conjectured in [6] that the relation λSWpXq “ ´λSWp´Xq holds for a
general homology S3 ˆ S1 (without any assumption on the metric). This conjecture is still
open.

3. Gauge theory on end-periodic manifolds

In this section, we study the gauge theory on the end-periodic manifolds. First, we
will carefully set up the (blown up) conﬁguration space, the gauge group and the moduli
spaces. Once this was done correctly, the arguments in Section 24 and 25 of the book can
be repeated without essential diﬃculty. For this reason, some proofs in this section will
only be sketched and we refer to the book for complete details.

Let δ be a positive number smaller than minpδ1, δ2q, where δ1, δ2 are constants provided

by Lemma 2.16 and Proposition 2.17 respectively. We let

Ak,δpX`q “ tA0 ` a|a P L2

k,δpX`; iT ˚X`qu

be the space of spinc connections of class L2

k,δ. The conﬁguration spaces are deﬁned as

k,δpX`; S`q;
k,δpX`; S`q, }φ}L2 “ 1, s P Rě0u.
It is easy to see that Ck,δpX`q is a Hilbert manifold without boundary, while Cσ
a Hilbert manifold with boundary. There is a map π : Cσ

where Gc – S1 denotes the group of constant gauge transformations. Note that we impose
k`1,δpX`q and the product topology on Gk`1,δpX`q. Using the
the L2
equality

k`1,δ-topology on G0

1 ´ uv “ p1 ´ uq ` p1 ´ vq ´ p1 ´ uqp1 ´ vq

together with the Sobolev multiplication theorem, one can prove that G0
k`1,δ (and hence
Gk`1,δ) is a group. A standard argument (see [14] and [?] for the non-abelian case) shows
that they are actually Hilbert Lie groups. The Lie algebra of Gk`1,δ is given by

TeGk`1,δpX`q “ R ‘ L2

k`1,δpX`; iRq.

(19)

Remark 9. Our main concern will be the group Gk`1,δpX`q, while the group G0
is introduced to smooth the arguments.

k`1,δpX`q

The actions of Gk`1,δpX`q on Ck,δpX`q and Cσ

k,δpX`q are respectively given by

and

u ¨ pA, Φq “ pA ´ u´1du, uΦq

u ¨ pA, s, φq “ pA ´ u´1du, s, uφq.

Note that the latter action is free. We denote the quotient spaces by Bk,δpX`q and
Bσ
k,δpX`q respectively.

Lemma 3.1. Bσ

k,δpX`q is Hausdorﬀ.

Proof. By standard argumet, the proof is reduced to the following claim:

Claim. : Suppose we have sequences tunu Ă Cσ
un Ñ u8 and gnun Ñ v8 for some u8, v8 P Cσ
such that g8u8 “ v8.

k,δpX`q, tgnu Ă Gk`1,δpX`q such that
k,δpX`q. Then we can ﬁnd g8 P Gk`1,δpX`q

To prove the claim, we let un “ pAn, sn, φnq. Then both An and An ´ g´1

k`1,δ norm, which implies that the sequence tg´1

¯ξn P iR such that tξn ´ ¯ξnu is a Cauchy sequence in L2
the exponential map

n dgn converges
k,δpX`; iRq. Let
k,δpX`; iRq. By Lemma 2.11, we can ﬁnd numbers
k`1,δpX`; iRq. Using the fact that

n dgnu is Cauchy in L2

k`1,δpX`; iT ˚X`q Ñ G0
L2

k`1,δpX`q : ξ ÞÑ eξ

is well deﬁned and continuous (which is a consequence of the Sobolev multiplication the-
orem). We see that teξn´ ¯ξnu is a Cauchy sequence in G0

k`1,δpX`q.

On the other hand, by replacing ξn with ξn ´ 2mnπi for mn P Z. We can assume
¯ξn P r0, 2πq. After passing to a subsequence, we may assume ¯ξn converges to some number
¯ξ8, which implies e

¯ξ8 as elements of Gc.

¯ξn converges to e

Now we see that gn “ e

¯ξn ¨ eξn´ ¯ξn has a subsequencial limit g8 in Gk`1,δpX`q. Since

the action of Gk`1,δpX`q is continuous, we get g8 ¨ u8 “ v8.

Next, we deﬁne the local slice Sσ

k,δ,γ of the gauge action at γ “ pA0, s0, φ0q P Cσ

By taking derivative on gauge group action, we get a map

Remark 10. To motivate this construction, we note that when s0 ą 0, Kσ
k,δ,γ is obtained
by lifting the L2-orthogonal complement of the tangent space of the gauge orbit (through
πpγq) in Ck,δpX`q.

Remark 11. We also note that in the book, the integral in the formula corresponding
to (20) is divided by the total volume of the 4-manifold. However, this diﬀerence is not
essential because the kernel is not aﬀected.

Lemma 3.2. For any γ, we have a decomposition Tγ Cσ

Proof. We want to show that for any pa, s, φq P Tγ Cσ

The index of D1 (hence D) equals 0 by Proposition 2.15 (iii). Here the index is increased
by 1 because we have an additional summand R in the domain (see (19)). As in the proof

of Proposition 9.3.5 of the book, we can show that D has trivial kernel using integration
by part. Therefore, D is an isomorphism and (21) has a unique solution.
(cid:3)

Remark 12. The integration by part argument over the noncompact manifold X` is justi-
ﬁed by the following fact (which can be proved using bump function): For any δ ą 0 and
θ P L2

We deﬁne the local slice S σ

k,δpX`q (at γ) as the set of points pA, s, φq satisfying

k,δ,γ Ă Cσ
dσ,5
γ pA ´ A0, s, φq “ 0

By Lemma 9.3.2 of the book, Lemma 3.2 has the following corollary.

k,δpX`q is a Hilbert manifold with boundary. For any γ P C σ

k,δpX`q,

Corollary 3.3. Bσ
there is an open neighborhood of γ in the slice
U Ă S σ

k,δ,γ

such that U is a diﬀeomorphism onto its image under the natural projection from Cσ
to Bσ

k,δpX`q, which is an open neighborhood of rγs in Bσ

k,δpX`q.

k,δpX`q

Now we study the Seiberg-Witten equations on the manifold X`. Let V σ

trivial bundle Cσ
of skew-hermitian, trace-0 automorphisms on S`. We consider a smooth section

k,δpX`q with ﬁber L2

k,δpX`q be the
k´1,δpisupS`q ‘ S´q, where supS`q denotes the bundle

The zero locus of Fσ describes the solution of the (blown-up) Seiberg-Witten equations.
To obtain the transversality condition, we introduce a perturbation on Fσ. This was
done in the same way as the book: Recall that the boundary BX` has a neighborhood N
which is isomorphic to r0, 3sˆY (with t0uˆY identiﬁed with BX`). Pick two 3-dimensional
tame perturbations q and p0. We impose the following assumption on q:

Assumption 3.4. q is a nice perturbation with htpqq “ ´2wpX, gX , 0q. Such perturbation
exists by Proposition 2.8.

These two perturbations induce, in a canonical way, 4-dimensional perturbations ˆqσ, ˆpσ
0
on N (see Page 153 and 155 of the book). Pick a cut-oﬀ function β that equals 1 near
t0u ˆ Y and equals 0 near t3u ˆ Y and a bump function β0 supported in p0, ´3q ˆ Y . Then
the sum

is a section of V σ
supported in N and only depends on pA|N , s, φ|N q.

We denote by p the 4-dimensional perturbation given by the section ˆpσ. Let Fσ

as the set of gauge equivalent classes of the solutions of the perturbed Seiberg-Witten
equations. ( For simplicity, we do not include p in our notations of moduli spaces.)

Lemma 3.5. For any choice of perturbations q, p0, the moduli space MpX`q is always a
Hilbert manifold with boundary MredpX`q.

Proof. The proof is essentially identical with Proposition 24.3.1 in the book. Just replace
the manifold X there with X` and use weighted Sobolev space through out the argument.
(cid:3)

Because of the unique continuation theorem (see Proposition 10,8.1 of the book), we

have φ|BX` ‰ 0 for any rpA, s, φqs P MpX`q. Therefore, we have a well deﬁned map

R´ : MpX`q Ñ Bσ

given by

Now we attach the cylindrical end p´8, 0s ˆ Y on X` and consider the Seiberg-Witten

equations on the manifold Z`. We deﬁne the conﬁguration space as

Ck;loc,δpZ`q “ tpA0 ` a, Φq|pa, Φq P L2

k,locpZ`; iT ˚Z` ‘ S`q, }pa, Φq|X`}L2

and gauge group as

Gk`1;loc,δpZ`q “ tu : Z` Ñ S1| u P L2

k`1,locpZ`; Cq, u|X` P Gk`1,δpX`qu.

Note that in the above deﬁnitons, we only impose the exponential decay condition over the
periodic end. As before, the action of Gk`1;loc,δpZ`q on Ck;loc,δpZ`q is not free. Therefore,
we need to blow up the conﬁguration space. Since Ck;loc,δpZ`q is not a Banach manifold
now, the blown-up conﬁguration space should be deﬁned in the following manner: Let S
be the topological quotient of the space

tΦ P L2

k,locpZ`; S`q|}Φ|X`}L2

k,δ

by the action of Rą0. The blown-up conﬁguration conﬁguration space is deﬁned as

Cσ
k;loc,δpZ`q “ tpA, Φ, φq|pA, Φq P Ck;loc,δpZ`q, φ P S, Φ P Rě0φu.

Now we deﬁne the blown-up quotient conﬁguration space as

k;loc,δpZ`q “ Cσ
Bσ

k;loc,δpZ`q{Gk`1;loc,δpZ`q.

The bundle V σ

k;loc,δpZ`q and its section Fσ

p pZ`q are deﬁned similarly as the book. The
section Fσ
p pZ`q is invariant under the action of Gk`1;loc,δpZ`q. We omit the detail here
because the speciﬁc deﬁnition is not important for us. Just keep in mind that the per-
turbation equals ˆqσ over the cylindrical end Z, equals ˆp over r0, 3s ˆ Y and equals 0 on

23

Jianfeng Lin

Z`zp´8, 3s ˆ Y . We call pA, φ, Φq a “Z`-trajectory” if Fσ
p pZ`qpA, φ, Φq “ 0. This is
equivalent to the condition that pA, Φ, φq satisﬁes the blown-up perturbed Seiberg-Witten

The second equation should be thought as a homogeneous equation in φ, i.e., both sides

The proof of the following lemma is identical with Lemma 24.2.2 in the book.

Lemma 3.6. The map ρ is a homeomorphism from MpZ`, rbsq to its image, which equals
the ﬁber product FibpR´, R`q. (The maps R˘ are deﬁned in (23) and (25) respectively.)

can be proved similarly (see also Proposition 24.3.2 of the book). (iii) is directly implied
by (i) and (ii).
(cid:3)

The following deﬁnition is parallel to Deﬁnition 24.4.2 of the book.

Deﬁnition 3.8. Let rγs P Mprbs, Z`q.
Mprbs, Z`q is regular at rγs if the maps of Hilbert manifolds

If rγs is irreducible, we say the moduli space

R` : Mprbs, Zq Ñ Bσ

k´1{2pY q and R´ : MpX`q Ñ Bσ

k´1{2pY q

are transverse at rγs. If rγs is reducible, we say the moduli space MpZ:; rcsq is regular at
rγs if the maps of Hilbert manifolds
R` : Mredprbs, Zq Ñ BBσ

k´1{2pY q and R´ : MredpX`q Ñ BBσ

k´1{2pY q

are transverse at ρprγsq (see (24)). We say the moduli space is regular if it is regular at
all points.

Recall that the perturbation p on Z` is determined a pair of 3-dimensional perturbations
pq, p0q (see (22)), where q is a nice perturbation that is ﬁxed throughout our argument (see
Assumption 3.4). We want to obtain the transversality condition by varying the second
perturbation p0. To do this, let PpY q be the large Banach space of 3-dimensional tame
perturbations provided by Theorem 11.6.1 of the book. We have the following result.

Proposition 3.9. There exists a residual subset U1 of PpY q such that for any p0 P U1, the
moduli space Mprbs, Z`q corresponding to pq, p0q is regular for any critical point rbs P C.

Proof. The proof follows the standard argument as in the proof of Proposition 24.4.7 of
the book: We consider parametrized moduli space

MpX`q Ă Bσ

k,δpX`q ˆ PpY q

MpX`q “ tpA, s, φ, p0q| Fσ

For any rbs P C, we can prove that the map

k´1{2pY q ˆ Bσ

k´1{2pY q

25

Jianfeng Lin

is transverse to the diagonal by the same argument as the book. Here the map R´ is
deﬁned similarly with R´ (but with larger domain). Now we apply the Sard-Smale lemma
(Lemma 12.5.1 of the book) to ﬁnish the proof. We note that Lemma 3.7 (iii) is used
essentially in this last step.
(cid:3)

The proof of the following proposition is by standard transversility argument and we

omit it. (Compare Proposition 24.4.3 of the book.)

Proposition 3.10. Suppose the moduli space Mprbs, Z`q is regular and non-empty. Then
the moduli space is

(i) a smooth manifold consisting only of irreducibles, if rbs is irreducible;
(ii) a smooth manifold consisting only of reducibles, if rbs is reducible and boundary-

stable;

(iii) a smooth manifold with (possibly empty) boundary, if rbs is reducible and boundary-

unstable.

In the last case, the boundary consists of the reducible elements of the moduli space (i.e.,
we have BMprbs, Z`q “ Mredprbs, Z`q).

Recall that we associated a rational number grQprbsq to each critical point rbs. We have

the following result.

Proposition 3.11. Suppose the moduli space Mprbs, Z`q is regular. Then the moduli
space is

(i) the empty set, if grQprbsq ` 2wpX, gX , 0q ă 0;
(ii) a manifold with dimension grQprbsq ` 2wpX, gX , 0q, if grQprbsq ` 2wpX, gX , 0q ě 0.

Proof. We just need to show that the expected dimension of Mprbs, Z`q (which we denote
by grpZ`; rbsq) can be expressed as

grpZ`; rbsq “ grQprbsq ` 2wpX, gX , 0q.

This can be done by direct computation. But we follow an alternative argument here.
Recall that M is a spin manifold with bounded by pY, sq with b1pMq “ 0. We let M ˚ “
M YY pr0, `8q ˆ Y q. As discussed before, the M -grading of rbs (which we denoted by
grpM ; rbsq) equals the expected dimension of the moduli space consisting of solutions
on M ˚ that are asymptotic to rbs. Since one can deform the linearized Seiberg-Witten
equations over the manifold M ˚YZ` ﬁrst to the corresponding equations over the manifold

M YY pr´T, T s ˆ Y q YY X` with T " 0

and then to the manifold M`. We see that the grading is additive in the sense that the
sum grpM ; rbsq ` grpZ`; rbsq equals the expected dimension MpM`q, the moduli space
consisting of gauge equivalent classes of solutions over M` that decay exponentially on
the periodic end. The linear operator that determines the local structure of MpM`q is a
compact perturbation of the operator

(cid:3)

Recall that we denote the lowest boundary stable reducible critical point by ra0s. Re-
call that the absolute grading ra0s equals the height of the nice perturbation q, which
has been chosen to be ´2wpX, gX , 0q (see Assumption 3.4). By Proposition 3.10 and
Proposition 3.11, for any p P U1 (the residue set provided by Lemma 3.9), the moduli
space Mpra0s, rZ`sq consists of discrete elements, all of which are reducible because ra0s
is boundary stable. The moduli spaces Mprais, rZ`sq pi ă 0q are all empty.
Proposition 3.12. There exists an open neighborhood U2 Ă PpY q of 0 such that for any
p0 P U2, the moduli space Mpra0s, rZ`sq corresponding to pq, p0q contains a single point.

Proof. Since the moduli space only consists of reducibles, we do not need to consider
the nice perturbation q since it vanishes on the reducibles. Moreover, we can describe the
moduli space explicitly: each gauge equivalent class of solutions of the downstairs equation

d`a ´ β0 ¨ ρ´1pˆp0

contributes a copy of CP0 in Mpra0s, rZ`sq. (Here β0 is the bump function in (22) and
ˆp0
0 is a component of the 4-dimensional, downstairs perturbation ˆp0 induced by the 3-
dimensional perturbation p0.) We want to show that when p0 (hence ˆp0
0) is small enough,
(27) has exactly one solution up to gauge equivalence. By the exponential decay result
Theorem 13.3.5 of the book (applied to a|Z ) and Lemma 2.16 (i), we see that each equiv-
alent class contains a unique representative satisfying

In other words, we just need to prove (27) has a unique solution satisfying the above gauge

k;´δ,δpZ`; iT ˚Z`q and a neighborhood U 1 of 0 P PpY q with the property that: for
0 P L2
any p0 P U 1, there exists a unique solution of the equation Ppp0, aq “ 0 with a P U . Now
we claim that we can ﬁnd another neighborhood U 2 of 0 P PpY q such that for any p0 P U 2,

27

Ppp0, aq “ 0 implies a P U . This will ﬁnish the proof because we can set U2 “ U 1 X U 2.
Now we prove our claim by contradiction. Suppose there exist p0,n Ñ 0 and an R U such
that Ppp0,n, anq “ 0 for each n. Integrating by part on p´8, ´0s ˆ Y and X`zr3, `8q
respectively, we see that

CSDppA0 ` anq|Y ˆt0u, 0q ă 0, CSDppA0 ` anq|Y ˆt3u, 0q ą 0.

Using these energy estimates, one can easily adapt the proof of Theorem 10.7.1 of the book
(from the single perturbation case to the case of a convergent sequence of perturbations)
and prove that: after passing to a subsequence and applying suitable gauge transformations
un, the sequence un ¨ ppA0 ` anq|Y ˆr1,2s, 0q converges smoothly. Notice that the gauge
invariant term β0 ¨ ρ´1pˆp0

pA0 ` anq|Y ˆr1,2s (because the bump function β0 is supported on r1, 2s ˆ Y ). We see that

Assumption 3.13. From now on, we ﬁx a choice of perturbation p0 P U1 X U2, where U1,
U2 are subsets of PpY q provided by Proposition 3.9 and Proposition 3.12 respectively.

As in the cylindrical case, a sequence of Z`-trajectories (even with unifomly bounded
energy) can converge to a broken trajectory. For this reason, we have to introduce the
moduli space of broken trajectories before discussing the compactness property. Although
our construction can be generalized to moduli space of higher dimension without essential
diﬃculty, we focus on 1-dimensional moduli spaces for simplicity. This will be enough for
our application.

We start with recalling the “τ -module” for blow up. (See Section 6.3 of the book for
details.) Let I Ă R be an interval. Denote the product manifold I ˆ Y by ZI . There are
two cases:

‚ Suppose I is compact, we deﬁne the conﬁguration space

The gauge group Gk`1pZIq acts on Cτ

k pZIq as

u ¨ pA0 ` a, s, φq “ pA0 ` a ´ u´1du, s, uφq.

‚ Suppose I is non-compact, we deﬁne Cτ

k,locpZIq by replacing L2

k with L2

k,loc in (28).

We denote the quotient space by Bτ

kpZI q.

We let Bτ

k,locpZIq “ Cτ

k,locpZIq{Gk`1,locpZI q.

In both cases, we impose the quotient topology on the quotient conﬁguration space. For
any rbs, rb1s P C, the moduli space Mprbs, rb1sq is a subset of Bτ
k,locpZp´8,`8qq and consists
of the non-constant Seiberg-Witten trajectories going from rbs to rb1s. We let ˘Mprbs, rb1sq “
Mprbs, rb1sq{R, where R acts as translation (reparametrization).

28

Jianfeng Lin

Now we deﬁne the moduli space of broken trajectories. Let rb0s be a critical point with
grQprb0sq “ 2wpX, gX , 0q ` 1. By our assumption about htpqq, rb0s must be irreducible.
We consider the set

M`prb0s, Z`q “ Mprb0s, Z`q Y p Y
rbsPC

˘Mprb0s, rbsq ˆ Mprbs, Z`qq.

By our regularity assumption, Mprb0s, Z`q is a 1-dimensional manifold (without bound-
ary). The set ˘Mprb0s, rbsq ˆ Mprbs, Z`q is nonempty only if grQprbsq “ 2wpX, gX , 0q, in
which case it is a discrete set.

To deﬁne the topology on M`prb0s, Z`q, we need to specify a neighborhood base for
each point. For those points in Mprb0s, Z`q, we just use their neighborhood basis inside
Mprb0s, Z`q. For a broken trajectory prγ´1s, rγ0sq P ˘Mprb0s, rbsq ˆ Mprbs, Z`q, we let
rγ´1s be represented by a parametrized trajectory

γ´1 P Mprb0s, rbsq.

Let U0 be a neighborhood of rγ0s in Bσ
k,loc,δpZ`q and let I Ă R be a compact interval
and U´1 Ă Bτ
kpZIq be a neighborhood of rγ´1|Is. For any T P Rą0 with the property
that I ´ T (the translation of I by ´T ) is contained in Rď0, we deﬁne ΩpU´1, U0, T q to
be the subset of M`prb0s, Z`q consisting of the broken Z`-trajectory prγ´1s, rγ0sq and
(unbroken) Z`-trajectories rγs P Mprb0s, Z`q satisfying the following conditions:

‚ rγs P U0;
‚ There exists T´1 ą T such that rτT´1pγ|I´T´1qs P U´1, where τT´1pγ|I´T´1q denotes

the translation of γ|I´T´1 by T´1 (in the positive direction).

We put the sets of the form ΩpU´1, U0, T q form a neighborhood basis for prγ´1s, rγ0sq.
With the topology on M`prb0s, Z`q deﬁned, we have the following gluing theorem, whose
proof is a word by word translation from the proof of Theorem 24.7.2 in the book and we
omit.
Theorem 3.14. For each broken Z`-trajectory prγ´1s, rγ0sq P M`prb0s, Z`q, we can ﬁnd
its open neighborhood U with Uzprγ´1s, rγ0sq Ă Mprb0s, Z`q and a homeomorphism f :
p0, 1s ˆ prγ´1s, rγ0sq Ñ U that sends t1u ˆ prγ´1s, rγ0sq to prγ´1s, rγ0sq P U .

Remark 13. Theorem 24.7.2 in the book actually contains the two parts: the boundary
obstructed case and the boundary unobstructed case. The second case is much easier
than the ﬁrst case. Theorem 3.14 here corresponds to the second case with the additional
assumption that the moduli space is 1-dimensional and the boundary of the 4-manifold is
connected. This further simpliﬁes the statement of the result.

Now we consider the orientation of the moduli spaces. As mentioned in Subsection
2.2, a choice of χprbsq in the orientation set Λprbsq for each rbs canonically induces an
orientation of the moduli space ˘Mprbs, rbsq for any critical points rbs, rb1s.
It was also
proved in Threorem 24.8.3 of the book that a choice of χprbsq and a homology orientation
of M determines an orientation of MpM ˚, rbsq (the moduli space of gauge equivalent
classes consisting of solutions on M ˚ “ M YY r0, `8q ˆ Y that are asymptotic to rbs). By
replacing the compact manifold M with the non-compact manifold X` and working with
the weighted Sobolev spaces instead of the unweighted ones, one can repeat the argument

29

Jianfeng Lin

there and prove the following similar result. Note that we do not need any homology
orientation of X`. This is essentially because of Lemma 2.16 (iv) (compare Lemma 24.8.1
of the book). An alternative viewpoint is that H 1pX`; Rq “ H 2pX`; Rq “ 0.

Theorem 3.15. A choice of tχprbsq| rbs P Cu canonically induces an orientation on the
moduli space Mprbs, Z`q for any critical point rbs. These orientations are compatible with
the gluing map in the following sense:
the map f provided by Theorem 3.14 is orien-
tation preserving when restricted to p0, 1q ˆ prγ´1s, rγ0sq, if we orient the moduli spaces
˘Mprb0s, rbsq, Mprbs, Z`qq and Mprb0s, Z`qq by the same choice tχprbsq| rbs P Cu and use
the positive orientation on the interval p0, 1q.

4. Compactness

In the current and the next section, we impose the following assumption:

Assumption 4.1. The scalar curvature scal of gX to be everywhere positive. In other
words, we have

s0 “ inf
xPX

scalpxq ą 0.

This assumption implies that the restriction of gZ` on Y
ně1

Wn, which is a lift of gX , has

uniformly positive scalar curvature. Under this assumption, we will prove the following
compactness theorem:

Theorem 4.2. For any rb0s P C with grQprb0sq “ ´2wpX, gX , 0q ` 1, the moduli space
M`prb0s, Z`q is compact.

(Again, the result can be generalized to arbitrary rb0s. But we focus on the current

case because that is all we need.)

4.1. The topological energy E top and the quantity Λq. We start with some standard
deﬁnitions in the book, which will be useful in our proof of compactness theorem. Let ˆX
be a general spinc 4-manifold and pA, Φq be a point of the conﬁguration space (i.e., A is
a spinc connection and Φ is a positive spinor over ˆX). Its topological energy is deﬁned as

where B “ A|B ˆX and H denotes the mean curvature of the boundary, which will be
vanishing if we use the product metric near the boundary. Note that in our situation,
the integrals in (29) are always convergent (even if ˆX is not compact) because FAt decays
exponentially over the end of ˆX. We also talk about the topological energy of a point in
the blown-up conﬁguration space (i.e., a triple pA, e, φq with e ě 0 and |φ|L2 “ 1). In this
case, we deﬁne E toppA, s, φq to be E toppπpA, s, φqq where

πpA, s, φq “ pA, sφq

as before. Since the topological energy is invariant under gauge transformation, it also
makes sense to talk about the topological energy of a gauge equivalent class.

The proof of this theorem uses Lemma 4.3 and the bootstraping argument. To make
it easier to follow, we break it into several lemmas. First, we let γn “ pAn, sn, φnq and
Φn “ snφn. The topological energy of γn can be broken into three parts (we treat the last
two terms as one part)

side of (34) by E1,n, E2,n and E3,n respectively.

Lemma 4.5. The energy terms E1,n, E2,n and E3,n are all uniformly bounded above.

Proof. Since the restriction of pAn, Φnq on X`zpr0, 3sˆ Y q is a solution of the unperturbed

Theorem 5.1.1 of the book, they converge in C 8 topology after passing to a subsequence,

We choose a cutoﬀ function τ : W Ñ r0, 1s that equals 0 near the left boundary and

4.3. Compactness: broken trajectories. With Theorem 4.4 (compare Theorem 24.5.2

Proof of Theorem 4.2. (Sketch) We ﬁrst consider a sequence rγns P ˘Mprb0s, Z`q pn ě 1q
represented by unbroken Z`-trajectories γn. Using integration by part, it is easy to see
that E top

γ|Z is a ﬂow line with limit rb0s). By similar decomposition as in the proof of Lemma 4.5,
we can prove that

Λqpγn|ttuˆY q ď C 1, @t P p´8, ǫs

`

Λqpγn|t2ǫuˆY q “ Λqpunpγnq|t2ǫuˆY q ě C 2

for some uniform constant C 2. Another application of Lemma 16.3.1 in the book provides
a uniform lower bound

Λqpγn|ttuˆY q ě C 3, @t P p´8, 2ǫs.

`

Now the proof proceed exactly as in the book: We can show that after passing to a further
subsequence, γn|p´8,2ǫs converges to a (possibly broken) half trajectory. Putting the two
pieces γn|p´8,2ǫsˆY and γn|X1
together, we see that after passing to a subsequence and
composing with suitable gauge transformations, γn converges to a (possibly broken) Z`-
trajectory γ8. By our regularity assumption, γ8 can have a most one breaking point,
whose absolute grading must be 2wpX, gX , 0q. In other words, the limit γ8 represents a
point of M`prb0s, Z`q.

We have shown that any sequence rγns P ˘Mprb0s, Z`q contains convergent subsequence
in M`prb0s, Z`q. By a similar argument, we see that ˘Mprbs, Z`q contains at most ﬁnitely
many elements for any rbs with grQprbsq “ ´2wpX, gX , 0q. Since there are only ﬁnitely
many critical points rbs with grQprbsq “ ´2wpX, gX , 0q and ˘Mprb0s, rbsq is a ﬁnite set for
each of them, we see that

M`prb0s, Z`qz ˘Mprb0s, Z`q “ p

˘Mprb0s, rbsq ˆ Mprbs, Z`qq

is a ﬁnite set. This ﬁnishes the proof of the theorem.

(cid:3)

5. Proof of the theorem 1.2

Suppose gX has positive scalar curvature everywhere. We ﬁrst prove that hpY, sq ď
2λSW pXq. Suppose this is not the case. Recall that λSW pXq “ ´ωpX, gX , 0q by Lemma
2.20. By Assumption 3.4, the perturbation q is chosen so that the condition of Lemma 2.9
is satisﬁed. As a result, we can ﬁnd nonzero integers n, m1, ..., ml and irreducible critical
points rb1s, ..., rbls P Co with grQprblsq “ ´2wpX, gX , 0q ` 1 such that

opm1rb1s ` ... ` mjrblsq “ 0 and Bo

spm1rb1s ` ... ` mjrblsq “ nra0s.

Now consider the manifold

M “ p Y

ml ¨ M`prbls, Z`qq Y p Y

ml ¨ ¯M`prbls, Z`q

37

Jianfeng Lin

where ml ¨˚ means the disjoint union ml copies and ¯M`prbls, Z`qq denotes the orientation
reversal of M`prbls, Z`q. By Theorem 3.14, Theorem 3.15, Theorem 4.2 and condition
(37), M is an oriented, compact 1-dimensional manifold with

#BM “ n ¨ # ˘Mpra0s, Z`q,

where as before, #˚ denotes the number of points, counted with sign, in an oriented
0-dimensional manifold. By Assumption 3.13 and Proposition 3.12, we get

#BM “ n ¨ ˘1 “ ˘n ‰ 0,

which is impossible because we know that the number, counted with sign, of boundary
points in any compact 1-manifold should be 0. This contradiction ﬁnishes the proof of the
inequality hpY, sq ď 2λSW pXq.

By applying the same argument to the manifold ´X, we also get hp´Y, sq ď 2λSWp´Xq,
which implies hpY, sq ě 2λSWpXq by Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 2.21. Therefore, we have
hpY, sq “ 2λSWpXq and the theorem is proved.

Appendix A. Laplace equation on end-periodic manifolds

This appendix is devoted to proving Proposition 2.15 using Fourier-Laplace transform
deﬁned in [14]. Our argument closely follows with [6] (where the corresponding problem
for the Dirac operator was studied).

To begin with, let us review the deﬁnition of Fourier-Laplace tranform. Let T : ˜X Ñ ˜X
be the covering transformation sending Wm to Wm`1. For x P ˜X and n P Z, we denote
0 p ˜X; Cq and a complex number µ P C, the
T npxq by x ` n. Given a function u P C 8
Fourier-Laplace transform of u is deﬁned as
µpxq “ eµ ˜f pxq
ˆu˚

eµnupx ` nq.

(Recall that ˜f is the harmonic function on ˜X satisfying ˜fpx ` 1q “ ˜f pxq ` 1.) It is easy
to check that ˆu˚

X, which we denote by ˆuµ. A simple observation is that

µpx ` 1q for any x P ˜X. Therefore, ˆu˚

(Here harmonic means that locally we can write ˆuµ as a power series in µ, with coeﬃcients

j .)

Now we discuss the Fourier-Laplace transform of the Laplace operator. Consider the

following operator

(41)
which is invariant under the covering transformation T . We denote by ∆µ the induced
operator on X. It is not hard to prove that

C 8p ˜X; Cq Ñ C 8p ˜X; Cq : u ÞÑ eµ ˜f ∆pe´µ ˜f uq

∆µ`2πiu “ e2πif ∆µpe´2πif ¨ uq

(42)

We call ∆µ the Fourier-Laplace transform of ∆ because

Since ˜f is harmonic, we have a simple formula for ∆µ:

zp∆uqµ “ ∆µpˆuµq for any u P C 8

0 p ˜X; Cq.

(43)
where we use the metric gX to deﬁne the inner product x¨, ¨y and the norm | ¨ | on T ˚X.
We can extend ∆µ to a Fredholm operator

∆µu “ ∆u ´ 2µxdu, f ˚pdθqy ` µ2|f ˚pdθq|2 ¨ u,

∆µ : L2

j`2pX; Cq Ñ L2

j pX; Cq,

for any non-negative integer j, which we ﬁx from now on. Just like ˆuµ, the operator ∆µ
is holomorpic in µ.

Lemma A.2. ∆µ is invertible for µ P iRz2πiZ.

j`2pX; Cq. Then w “ e´µ ˜f ˜u is
Proof. Suppose ∆µu “ 0 for some µ P iRz2πiZ and u P L2
a harmonic function on ˜X, where ˜u is a lift of u to ˜X. Notice that wpx ` 1q “ eµwpxq
for any x, which implies |wpx ` 1q “ |wpxq| because Re µ “ 0. By maximal principle, w
equals a constant C satisfying C “ eµC. Since eµ ‰ 1, we see that w (and hence u) must
be 0. We have proved that ∆µ has trivial kernel for any µ P iRz2πiZ, which implies the
lemma because the index of ∆µ is always 0.
(cid:3)

By [14, Lemma 4.5], we have the following corollary.

39

Jianfeng Lin

Corollary A.3. ∆µ is invertible for all µ P CzS where S is a discrete set invariant under
the translation µ ÞÑ µ ` 2πi. S does not intersect iRz2πiZ and has no accumulation point
(in C). In particular, there exists a constant δ4 ą 0 such that ∆µ is invertible for any µ
satisfying ´δ4 ď Re µ ď δ4, µ R 2πiZ.

Denote by Rµ the inverse of the holomorphic family ∆µ. Then Rµ is holomorphic in µ

for µ in the region CzS. By (41), we have

Rν`2πipe2πif uq “ e2πif ¨ Rνpuq.

(44)

Lemma A.4. 0 is a pole of Rµ with order 2.

Proof. We can write down the explicit formula of Rµ for small µ. To do this, we consider
the Hilbert space

for l “ j, j ` 2 and ﬁx the identiﬁcation

By elementary calculation involving (43), we see that under this identiﬁcation, the operator

Suppose we have a harmonic function u satisfying (45). By standard elliptic bootstrapping

(see Corollary A.3).

To compute the residue, we consider the Laurent series of Rµˆκµ near µ “ 0. Since κ is
compactly supported and smooth, ˆκµ is holomorphic over the whole complex plane. By
Lemma A.4, we can write the Laurent series as

Since ˆκµ is holomorphic at 0. We get

(cid:3)

Proof of Proposition 2.15. Let δ0 a positive number less than minpδ4, δ5, δ6q, where δ4, δ5
are constants in Lemma A.3 and Lemma A.5 respectively and δ6 equals the smallest
positive eigenvalue of ∆pY q (the Laplace operator over Y ). For any δ P p0, δ0q, let us
check the Fredholm properties of the operators one by one.

First consider ∆p ˜X; ´δ, δq, since ∆µ is invertible for any µ with Re µ “ ˘δ, by [14,
Lemma 4.3], the operator ∆p ˜X; ´δ, δq is Fredholm. By the maximum principle, the op-
erator ∆p ˜X; ´δ, δq has trivial kernel. The cokernel of ∆p ˜X; ´δ, δq is isomorphic to the
´j´2; δ,´δp ˜X, Rq to
kernel of its adjoint operator, which is the Laplace operator from L2
´j; δ,´δp ˜X, Rq. By elliptic bootstrapping and Proposition A.5, we get
L2

dimpcoker ∆p ˜X; ´δ, δqq “ 2.

Now consider the operator ∆pM`; δq. By [14, Lemma 4.3] again, this operator is Fred-

holm. To compute its index, we consider its adjoint operator ∆pM`; ´δq. We have

2 ind ∆pM`; δq “ ind ∆pM`; δq ´ ind ∆pM`; ´δq “ ind ∆p ˜X; ´δ, δq “ 2.

The second equality above uses the excision principle of index (see [6, Proposition 6.1]).
By the maximum principle, the kernel of ∆pM`; δq is trivial. Therefore, the operator
∆pM`; δq has 1-dimensional cokernel.

Now we consider the operator ∆pX`; δq. By classical results on the Laplace equation

with Neumann boundary condition, both the operator

∆p ¯M q : L2

j`2p ¯M ; Rq Ñ L2

j p ¯M ; Rq ‘ L2

j`1{2pY, Rq

and the operator

u ÞÑ p∆u, xdu, ~vyq

∆pM YY ¯Mq : L2

j`2pM YY ¯M ; Rq Ñ L2

j pM YY ¯M ; Rq

are Fredholm with index 0. By the excision principle relating ∆pX`; δq ‘ ∆pM YY ¯Mq
with ∆p ¯Mq ‘ ∆pM`; δq, we see that ∆pX`; δq is Fredholm and

ind ∆pX`; Rq “ ind ∆pM YY ¯Mq ` ind ∆pM`; δq ´ ind ∆pM YY ¯M q “ ´1.

u ÞÑ ∆u

Suppose u P ker ∆pX`; Rq. Then d ˚ du “ 0 and i˚p˚duq “ 0, where i : Y Ñ X` is
inclusion of the boundary. We have

żX`

xdu, duydvol “ ´żX`

du ^ ˚du “ ´żX`

u ^ pd ˚ duq `żY

u ¨ i˚p˚duq “ 0,

42

Jianfeng Lin

In other words, u is a constant function. Because u P L2
∆pX`; Rq has trivial kernel and 1-dimensional cokernel.

j`2;δpX`; Rq, we have u “ 0. Thus

We are left with the manifold Z`. The argument is similar: Notice that we set δ0 to be
less than the ﬁrst positive eigenvalue of ∆pY q, which also equals the ﬁrst positive eigenvalue
of ∆pS1 ˆ Y q. By [14, Lemma 4.3] again, the Laplace operator ∆pZ`; ´δ, δq is Fredholm.
To conclude that its index equals ´2, we apply the excision principle relating the manifold
Z` Y pM YY ¯Mq with the manifold M` Y M´ (recall that M´ “ pp´8, 0s ˆ Y q YY ¯M ).
Then we use the maximum principle (or integration by part) to prove that the kernel is
trivial.
