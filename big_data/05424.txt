THE Q-TENSOR SQUARE OF FINITELY GENERATED

NILPOTENT GROUPS, q ≥ 0

NORAÍ R. ROCCO AND EUNICE C. P. RODRIGUES

Abstract. In the present paper the authors extend to the q−tensor square G⊗q G
of a group G, q a non-negative integer, some structural results due to R. D. Blyth,
F. Fumagalli and M. Morigi concerning the non-abelian tensor square G⊗G (q = 0).
The results are applied to the computation of G⊗q G for ﬁnitely generated nilpotent
groups G, specially for free nilpotent groups of ﬁnite rank. We also generalize to
all q ≥ 0 results of M. Bacon regarding an upper bound to the minimal number
of generators of the non-abelian tensor square G ⊗ G when G is a n−generator
nilpotent group of class 2. We end by computing the q−tensor squares of the free
n−generator nilpotent group of class 2, n ≥ 2, for all q ≥ 0. This shows that the
above mentioned upper bound is also achieved for these groups when q > 1.

1. Introduction

Let G and Gϕ be groups, isomorphic via ϕ : g (cid:55)→ gϕ for all g ∈ G. Consider the

group ν(G), introduced in [23] as

ν(G) =(cid:10)G ∪ Gϕ | [g, hϕ]k = [gk, (hk)ϕ] = [g, hϕ]kϕ, ∀g, h, k ∈ G(cid:11) .

(1)

It is a well known fact (see [23]) that the subgroup Υ(G) = [G, Gϕ] of ν(G) is iso-
morphic to the non-abelian tensor square G ⊗ G, as deﬁned by Brown and Loday
in their seminal paper [8]. A modular version of the operator ν was considered in
[10], where for any non-negative integer q the authors introduced and studied a group
νq(G), which in turn is an extension of the so called q-tensor square of G, G⊗q G, ﬁrst
deﬁned by Conduché and Rodriguez-Fernandez in [11] (see also [14], [7]). In order

to describe the group νq(G), if q ≥ 1 then let (cid:98)G = {(cid:98)k | k ∈ G} be a set of symbols,
one for each element of G (for q = 0 we set (cid:98)G = ∅, the empty set). Let F ((cid:98)G) be
the free group over (cid:98)G and ν(G) (cid:63) F ((cid:98)G) be the free product of ν(G) and F ((cid:98)G). As G

There is an epimorphism ρ : ηq(G) (cid:16) G, g (cid:55)→ g, hϕ (cid:55)→ h,(cid:98)k (cid:55)→ kq. On the other

i=1 Ri. Therefore, νq(G) has the presentation:

hand the inclusion of G into ν(G) induces a homomorphism ı : G → νq(G). We
have gıρ = g and thus ı is injective. Similarly the inclusion of Gϕ into ν(G) induces
a monomorphism  : Gϕ → νq(G). Thus we shall identify the elements g ∈ G and
gϕ ∈ Gϕ with their respective images gı and (gϕ) in νq(G).

Now let G denote the subgroup of νq(G) generated by the images of (cid:98)G. By relations

(4), G normalizes the subgroup T = [G, Gϕ] in νq(G) and hence Υq(G) = T G =
[G, Gϕ]G is a normal subgroup of νq(G). Thus we obtain νq(G) = Gϕ · (G · Υq(G)),
where the dots mean internal semidirect products. It should be noted that the actions
for
of G and Gϕ on Υq(G) are those induced by the deﬁning relations of νq(G):

any elements g, x ∈ G, hϕ, yϕ ∈ Gϕ and (cid:98)k ∈ (cid:98)G we have [g, hϕ]x = [gx, (hx)ϕ] and
((cid:98)k)x = (cid:100)(kx); similarly, [g, hϕ]yϕ = [gy, (hy)ϕ] and ((cid:98)k)yϕ = (cid:100)(ky). In addition, for any

τ ∈ Υq(G), (gτ )yϕ = g[g, yϕ]τ yϕ ∈ GΥq(G).
By [10, Proposition 2.9] Υq(G) is isomorphic to the q-tensor square G⊗q G, for all
q ≥ 0. We then get a result (see [10, Corollary 2.11]) analogous to one due to Ellis in
[14]: νq(G) ∼= G (cid:110) (G (cid:110) (G ⊗q G)); this generalizes a similar result found in [23] for
q = 0.
The commutator approach to G⊗G for the case q = 0, provided by the isomorphism
between G⊗ G and the subgroup [G, Gϕ] of ν(G) (see [23], and also [15]), has proven
suitable to treat of non-abelian tensor products of groups, Schur multipliers and many
other relevant invariants involving covering questions in groups; see for instance,
references [15], [24], [20], [4], [12], [21] and the GAP Package “POLYCYCLIC” in [13].

Q-TENSOR SQUARE OF NILPOTENT GROUPS

3

The extension of the existing theory from q = 0 to all non-negative integers q, as
addressed for instance in [10], broadens the scope of these connections, now in a hat
(“power”) and commutator approach to the q-tensor square, q ≥ 0.
In section 2 we extend to G ⊗q G, q ≥ 0, some structural results found in [5] and
[24] concerning G ⊗ G. In section 3 it is established an upper bound for the minimal
number of generators of G ⊗q G when G is a ﬁnitely generated nilpotent group of
class 2, thus generalizing a result of Bacon found in [2]. We end by computing the
q-tensor square of the free nilpotent group of rank n ≥ 2 and class 2, Nn,2, q ≥ 0;
this will show, as in the case q = 0 (see [2, Theorem 3.2]), that the cited upper bound
is also attained for these groups when q > 1, although in this case Nn,2 ⊗q Nn,2 is a
non-abelian group.
Notation is fairly standard (see for instance [22]). If x and y are elements of a
group G then we write yx for the conjugate x−1yx and [x, y] for the commutator
x−1y−1xy. Our commutators are left normed: [x, y, z] = [[x, y], z] for all x, y, z ∈ G,
and so on, recursively, for commutators of higher weights. The order of x (resp. of G)
is written o(x) (resp. |G|). As usual, γi(G) denotes the ith term of the lower central
series of G. For future reference we recall the well known Hall-Witt identity:
(9)
In view of the isomorphism given by [10, Proposition 2.9], from now on we identify
G ⊗q G with the subgroup Υq(G) = [G, Gϕ]G ≤ νq(G) and write [g, hϕ] in place of
g ⊗ h, for all g, h ∈ G. Following [10] we write ∆q(G) for the subgroup (cid:104)[g, gϕ]|g ∈
G(cid:105) ≤ Υq(G), which by Lemma 2.1 (vii) is a central subgroup of νq(G). We write
τ q(G) for the factor group νq(G)/∆q(G). The subgroup Υq(G)/∆q(G) of τ q(G) is
isomorphic to the q-exterior square G ∧q G.
In order to avoid any confusion we
usually write [G, Gϕ]τ (G) to identify the q-exterior square G ∧q G with the image of
[G, Gϕ] in τ q(G). We shall eventually write T to denote the subgroup [G, Gϕ] of νq(G)
in order to distinguish it from the nonabelian tensor square G ⊗ G ∼= [G, Gϕ] ≤ ν(G)
in the case q = 0.

[x, y−1, z]y[y, z−1, x]z[z, x−1, y]x = 1, ∀x, y, z ∈ G.

The material presented here incorporates part of the doctoral thesis [25] of the

second named author, written under the supervision of the ﬁrst.

2. Some Structural Results

In this section we extend results found in [5] and [24] related to the non-abelian
tensor square, from G ⊗ G to G ⊗q G, q ≥ 0. We begin by including some previous,
technical results for future references.

The following basic properties are consequences of the deﬁning relations of νq(G).
Lemma 2.1. [10, Lemma 2.4] Suppose that q ≥ 0. The following relations hold in
νq(G), for all g, h, x, y ∈ G.

(i) [g, hϕ][x,yϕ] = [g, hϕ][x,y];
(ii) [g, hϕ, xϕ] = [g, h, xϕ] = [g, hϕ, x] = [gϕ, h, xϕ] = [gϕ, hϕ, x] = [gϕ, h, x];
(iii) If h ∈ G(cid:48) (or if g ∈ G(cid:48)) then [g, hϕ][h, gϕ] = 1;

(iv) [(cid:98)x, [g, hϕ]] = [(cid:98)x, [g, h]];
(v) ((cid:98)x)g =(cid:98)x[xq, gϕ];

4

ROCCO AND RODRIGUES

(vi) If [g, h] = 1 then [g, hϕ] and [h, gϕ] are central elements of νq(G), of the
same ﬁnite order dividing q. If in addition g, h are torsion elements of orders
o(g), o(h), respectively, then the order of [g, hϕ] divides the gcd(q, o(g), o(h)).

(vii) [g, gϕ] is central in νq(G), for all g ∈ G;
(viii) [g, hϕ][h, gϕ] is central in νq(G);
(ix) [g, gϕ] = 1, for all g ∈ G(cid:48);
(x) If [x, g] = 1 = [x, h], then [g, h, xϕ] = 1 = [[g, h]ϕ, x].

Corollary 2.2. Let G be any group and let g, h be arbitrary elements in G. Then

(i) [G(cid:48), Gϕ] = [G, G(cid:48)ϕ];
(ii) [G(cid:48), Z(G)ϕ] = 1;
(iii) If gG(cid:48) = hG(cid:48) then [g, gϕ] = [h, hϕ];
(iv) If o(cid:48)(x) denotes the order of a coset xG(cid:48) ∈ G/G(cid:48), then [g, hϕ][h, gϕ] has order
(v) The order of [h, hϕ] divides the gcd(q, o(cid:48)(h)2, 2o(cid:48)(h)).

dividing the gcd(q, o(cid:48)(g), o(cid:48)(h));

Proof. Part (i) follows directly from Lemma 2.1 (iii) (see also [5, Corollary 1.2 (iii)]).
As for part (ii), see [23, Proposition 2.7 (i)].The remaining parts are appropriate
(cid:3)
adaptations of [24, Lemma 3.1 (v)], using (7) and Lemma 2.1 (vi).
For our purposes we establish the following proposition, which may have its own

interest.
Proposition 2.3. Let G be a nilpotent group of class 2. Then the following hold
in νq(G):

(i) G centralizes [G, Gϕ];
(ii) [G(cid:48), Gϕ] (= [G, G(cid:48)ϕ]) is a central subgroup of νq(G);
(iii) Υq(G) (∼= G ⊗q G ) is nilpotent of class at most 2.

Proof. (i) follows straightforward from 2.1 (iv) and relation (2), once G has nilpotency
class 2.
(ii). For all g, h ∈ G and c ∈ G(cid:48) we have:

[c, gϕ]h = [c, gϕ][c, gϕ, h]
= [c, gϕ][c, g, hϕ]
= [c, gϕ]
= [c, gϕ]hϕ

(cid:92)

(by Lemma 2.1, (i))
(since [c, g] = 1, as G(cid:48) ≤ Z(G))
(by deﬁnition of νq(G)).

In addition, for all(cid:98)k ∈ (cid:98)G, by Lemma 2.1 (iv) and relations (2) we have that(cid:98)k[c,gϕ] =
(cid:98)k[c,g] =
(k[c,g]) = (cid:98)k, since [c, g] = 1. This proves part (ii) (using the deﬁnition of

νq(G)), because [G(cid:48), Gϕ] is generated by all those [c, gϕ] above.
(iii). That Υq(G) is nilpotent and has nilpotency class at most 3 follows from [10,
Proposition 2.7, (i)]. Now, Υq(G) = [G, Gϕ]G and thus, once G centralizes [G, Gϕ],
we have

(Υq(G))(cid:48) = [[G, Gϕ]G, [G, Gϕ]G] ≤ [G, Gϕ](cid:48)[G, G].

Induction arguments can be used, together with Lemma 2.1 (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) and
deﬁning relations (6) – (7) to get:

5
(a) [G, Gϕ](cid:48) = [G(cid:48), (G(cid:48))ϕ] (see also [5, Proposition 1.3 (i)] or [23, Theorem 3.3]);

Q-TENSOR SQUARE OF NILPOTENT GROUPS

(b) [G, G] ≤ (cid:104)(cid:98)G(cid:48)(cid:105)[G(cid:48), Gϕ] ≤ [G(cid:48), Gϕ].

Consequently, (Υq(G))(cid:48) ≤ [G(cid:48), Gϕ], which by part (ii) is central in νq(G). This com-
(cid:3)
pletes the proof.

For a ﬁnitely generated abelian group A, its q-tensor square Υq(A) can be com-

puted by repeated applications of the following two results from [10].
Lemma 2.4. [10, Corollary 2.16] Let G = N × H be a direct product and set N =
N/N(cid:48)N q, H = H/H(cid:48)H q. Then

(i) Υq(G) = Υq(N ) × [N, H ϕ][H, N ϕ] × Υq(H);
(ii) [N, H ϕ] ∼= (N ⊗Zq H) ∼= [H, N ϕ].

Lemma 2.5. [10, Theorem 3.1] Let Cn (resp. C∞) be the cyclic group of order n
(resp. ∞), q a non- negative integer and d = gcd(n, q). Then

C∞ ⊗q C∞ ∼= C∞ × Cq;

if d is odd;
if d is even and either 4|n or 4|q;

i=1 Ci is a direct product of the cyclic groups Ci, i = 1, . . . , r, where

ROCCO AND RODRIGUES

Now let G be any group and write Gab = G/G(cid:48). The natural projection G (cid:16) Gab
induces an epimorphism π : νq(G) → νq(Gab). We denote by π0 the restriction of π to

Υq(G). By [10, Lemma 2.14 (iii)] we have that Ker(π0) = [G(cid:48), Gϕ][G, G(cid:48)ϕ](cid:104)(cid:98)G(cid:48)(cid:105), which
reduces to [G(cid:48), Gϕ](cid:104)(cid:98)G(cid:48)(cid:105), by force of Corollary 2.2 (i). In addition, using relations (5)
(cid:100)(G(cid:48)) ≤ [G(cid:48), Gϕ] and, consequently, Ker(π0) = [G(cid:48), Gϕ].

and (7), an induction argument as in the proof of the Proposition2.3 (ii) shows that
The next Lemma extends [5, Lemma 2.1] to all q ≥ 0 (see also [24, Proposition

3.3]). We shall omit the proof.
Lemma 2.7. Let q be a non negative integer and G be a group such that Gab is ﬁnitely
generated. Assume that Gab is a direct product of the cyclic groups Ci = (cid:104)xiG(cid:48)(cid:105), for
i = 1, . . . , r and set

Eq(G) = (cid:104)(cid:98)xi, [xj, xϕ

k ]| 1 ≤ i ≤ r, 1 ≤ j < k ≤ r rangle [G(cid:48), Gϕ].

Then,

(i) ∆q(G) = (cid:104)[xi, xϕ
(ii) Υq(G) = ∆q(G)Eq(G).
With the above notation, let π1 denote the restriction of π0 to ∆q(G), π1 : ∆q(G) (cid:16)
∆q(Gab), and let N = Ker(π1). Therefore, N = ∆q(G)∩[G(cid:48), Gϕ] (= ∆q(G) ∩ Eq(G)) ,
a central subgroup of Υq(G).
Our next theorem generalizes, to all q ≥ 0, Proposition 2.2 in [5], which in turn

improves Proposition 3.3 in [24].
Theorem 2.8. Let q ≥ 0 and assume that Gab is ﬁnitely generated. Then, with the
notation of Lemma 2.7, the following hold:
(i) Υq(G)/N ∼= ∆q(Gab) × (G ∧q G);
(ii) If q ≥ 1 and q is odd, then N = 1 and thus ∆q(G) ∼= ∆q(Gab) and Υq(G) ∼=
∆q(Gab) × (G ∧q G);
(iii) For q = 0 or q ≥ 2 and q even, if Gab has no element of order two or if G(cid:48)
has a complement in G, then also N = 1, ∆q(G) ∼= ∆q(Gab) and Υq(G) ∼=
∆q(Gab) × (G ∧q G);
(iv) For q ≥ 2 and q even, if Gab has no element of order 2, then ∆q(G) is a

homocyclic abelian group of exponent q, of rank(cid:0)t+1
(cid:1);
(cid:1) if q = 0.
for all q ≥ 1, while ∆q(G) is free abelian of rank(cid:0)t+1

(v) If Gab is free abelian of rank t, then the conclusion of the previous item holds

Q-TENSOR SQUARE OF NILPOTENT GROUPS

(ii), (iii), (iv) and (v): Suppose that the torsion subgroup of Gab is the direct product
of the cyclic groups (cid:104)xiG(cid:48)(cid:105) of order ni, 1 ≤ i ≤ s, and let the free part of Gab be
the direct product of the cyclic groups (cid:104)yjG(cid:48)(cid:105), 1 ≤ j ≤ t. Thus, o(cid:48)(xi) = ni and
o(cid:48)(yj) = ∞. Set X := {xi | 1 ≤ i ≤ s} and Y := {yj | 1 ≤ j ≤ t}. Then G is generated
by X ∪ Y ∪ G(cid:48). Using Lemma 2.1 and Corollary 2.2 (see also [24, Proposition 3.3 and
Remark 5]) we ﬁnd that ∆q(G) is generated by the set ∆X ∪ ∆Y ∪ ∆XY , where

∆X = {[xi, xϕ
∆Y = {[yj, yϕ
∆XY = {[xi, yϕ

Set nik = gcd(ni, nk). Parts (iv) and (v) of Corollary 2.2 give ([xi, xϕ
i ])nik = 1
i ]ni ∈ Ker(π0), ∀i, k = 1, . . . , s, i < k,∀j =
and ([xi, yϕ
1, . . . t. Actually, Ker(π0) is generated by the set {[xi, xϕ
i ]ni | 1 ≤ i ≤ s}, by [24,
Proposition 3.5]. Again by Corollary 2.2 (v), we get that if ni(= o(cid:48)(xi)) is odd,
i ]2ni = 1 if ni is even. Consequently, N = Ker(π0)
then [xi, xϕ
is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank at most r2(Gab), the 2 − rank of Gab (see
also [24, Corollary 3.6]). On the other hand, we should take into account that q is
involved in the upper bound found in Corollary 2.2 ( v). Thus, if q ≥ 1 and q is
odd, then gcd(q, 2ni) = gcd(q, ni) | ni and hence [xi, xϕ
i ]ni = 1, for all i = 1, . . . , s.
Therefore N = 1 in this case, proving part (ii). It should be also clear that N = 1
if r2(Gab) = 0. This proves (iii) in the case where Gab has no element of order 2.
Now, if G(cid:48) has a complement C in G, then every g ∈ G can be written as g = xh
with x ∈ C and h ∈ G(cid:48). Corollary 2.2 (iii) says that [g, gϕ] = [x, xϕ] and thus
∆q(G) = (cid:104)[x, xϕ]| x ∈ C(cid:105) = ∆q(Gab). This completes the prof of part (iii) (see
also [5, Proposition 2.2]). Finally, we observe that [xi, xϕ
j ][yj, xϕ
i ]
in the case where r2(Gab) = 0 and q ≥ 2, q even. Here we have ∆q(G) = (cid:104)∆Y (cid:105)

We state the next Lemma for easy of reference, which in a certain sense extends
ideas found in [19] for the case q = 0. A proof is given in [8] for q = 0 (see also [5,
Proposition 3.2] for an alternative proof for this case) and in [16] for q ≥ 1.

Let ρ(cid:48) = ρ|Υq(G) : Υq(G) −→ G, [g1, g2
Following [10] we write θq(G) = Ker(ρ) and µq(G) = Ker(ρ(cid:48)) = Υq(G) ∩ θq(G). It
follows that Υq(G)/µq(G) ∼= G(cid:48)Gq. If G = F/R is a free presentation of G, then

3. q-Tensor Squares of Nilpotent Groups of Class 2

In this section we restrict our considerations to ﬁnitely generated nilpotent groups
G of class two. We begin with a general result concerning polycyclic groups found in
[10]; this generalizes to all q ≥ 0 a result due to Blyth and Morse in [4] for q = 0,
which in turn extends to all polycyclic groups a similar result for ﬁnite solvable groups
found in [24].
Lemma 3.1. ([10, Corolary 3.6]) Let G be a polycyclic group with a polycyclic gen-
erating sequence pgs(G) = (a1, . . . , an) . Then

Now let G be a ﬁnitely generated nilpotent group of class two and assume that G

is generated by g1, g2,··· , gn. Thus, any element g ∈ G can be written as

g =

where the exponents mi and ljk are integers. Consequently, G has the following
polycyclic generating set
(13)

{gi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n} ∪ {[gj, gk], 1 ≤ j < k ≤ n}.

The following theorem extends a result of Bacon in [2, Theorem 3.1] (see also [3])
for all q ≥ 0. We provide a proof for the case q = 0 using the commutator approach;
the general case follows straightforward from this case and Lemma 3.1 (ii), but we
shall prove it in this case too, for the sake of completeness.
Theorem 3.2. Let G be a nilpotent group of class two with d(G) = n, then

(i) ([2, Theorem 3.1]) d([G, Gϕ]) ≤ n(n2+3n−1)
(ii) d(G ⊗q G) ≤ n(n2+3n+2)
(iii) In particular, if G has ﬁnite exponent e(G) and gcd(q, e(G)) = 1 , then

, for all q ≥ 0;

;

d(G ⊗q G) ≤ n2.

Proof. On assuming that G is generated by g1, . . . , gn then we obtain the polycyclic
generating set given by (13). Thus, by Lemma 3.1 (i) we have that Υ(G) = [G, Gϕ]
is generated by the following set of elements:

{[gα

i , (gϕ

j )β] : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}∪

{[gα
{[[gj, gk]β, (gϕ

i , ([gj, gk]ϕ)β] : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j < k ≤ n}∪
i )α] : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j < k ≤ n}∪

{[[gr, gs]α, ([gt, gu]ϕ)β] : 1 ≤ r < s ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < u ≤ n}, where α, β ∈ {−1, 1}.
Now by Lemma 2.1, parts (ii), (iii), (ix), (x), and the fact that G has class 2, we can
further reduce the above set to obtain
(14)

j ] : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} ∪ {[gi, [gj, gk]ϕ] : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j < k ≤ n}.

{[gi, gϕ

ROCCO AND RODRIGUES

j ] and n(n− 1) generators of the form
This new set has n2 generators of the form [gi, gϕ
[gi, [gj, gi]ϕ]. It remains to count the generators of the form [gi, [gj, gk]ϕ], when i, j, k
are all distincts and j < k. Now by [23, Corollary 3.2] ν(G) has nilpotency class at
most 3 and thus, again

[gϕ

j , gϕ

k , gi][gϕ

k , gϕ

i , gj][gi, gj, gϕ

k ] = 1.

It then follows that [gi, [gj, gk]ϕ] = [gj, [gi, gk]ϕ][gk, [gj, gi]ϕ]. Therefore,

d([G, Gϕ]) ≤ 1
3

n(n2 + 3n − 1).

This proves part (i).
(ii): Part (i) also proves (ii) in case q = 0, giving us the better bound for d(G ⊗ G).
Thus, we shall assume q ≥ 1. Since Υq(G) = [G, Gϕ]G it suﬃces to control the number
of generators of both [G, Gϕ] and G. We already know by part (i) that [G, Gϕ] is
k ≤ n}. Now, by deﬁnition the subgroup G is generated by (cid:98)G = {(cid:98)g, g ∈ G}. By
i ] : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} ∪ {[gi, [gj, gk]ϕ] : 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j <
generated by the set {[gi, gϕ
the deﬁning relations (5) of νq(G) we have (cid:99)gh = (cid:98)g ((cid:81)q−1
i=1 [g, (hϕ)−i]gq−1−i)(cid:98)h, for all
g, h ∈ G, and hence (cid:99)gh ≡ (cid:98)g(cid:98)h (mod [)G, Gϕ], for all (cid:98)g,(cid:98)h ∈ (cid:98)G. Since every element
g ∈ G has a unique expression in the form (12) and given the fact that, for every
stage that G is generated, modulo [G, Gϕ], by the n elements (cid:98)g1, . . . ,(cid:98)gn. Therefore,
commutator [gj, gk] ∈ G(cid:48), (cid:92)[gj, gk] = [gj, gϕ
k ]q ∈ [G, Gϕ] (by relations (7)), we see in later
we conclude that d(Υq(G)) ≤ 1
(iii): If in particular G has ﬁnite exponent e(G) and gcd(q, e(G)) = 1, then we see by
Lemma 2.1 (vi) that all generators of the forms [gi, gϕ
i ] and [gi, [gj, gk]ϕ] are trivial.
Consequently, d(G ⊗q G) ≤ n2 in this case. The proof is complete.

3n(n2 + 3n − 1).

In [1] Aboughazi computed the nonabelian tensor square of the Heisenberg group
H = F2/γ3(F2), where F2 denotes the free group of rank 2. There, it is found that
H ⊗ H ∼= Z6, thus showing that the bound in Theorem 3.2 is sharp. Later, Bacon in
[2, Theorem 3.2] computed Nn,2 ⊗ Nn,2 for all n ≥ 2, to show that the bound is also
reached for the free n−generator nilpotent group of class 2, n > 1: Nn,2 ⊗ Nn,2 is a
free abelian group of rank 1
It is not diﬃcult to extend these results to the q−tensor square Υq(Nn,2), q ≥ 1, to
show that the bound in Theorem 3.2 (ii) is also attained. In fact, the next proposition
is but a specialization of Corollary 2.11. We write M (G) to denote the Schur multiplier
H2(G, Z) of G.
Proposition 3.3. Let Nn,2 be the free nilpotent group of rank n > 1 and class 2,
Nn,2 = Fn/γ3(Fn). Then,
