Graphene layers are known to stack in two stable conﬁgurations, namely ABA or ABC stacking,
with drastically distinct electronic properties. Unlike the ABA stacking, little has been done to
experimentally investigate the electronic properties of ABC graphene multilayers. Here, we report
the ﬁrst magneto optical study of a large ABC domain in a graphene multilayers ﬂake, with ABC
sequences exceeding 17 graphene sheets. The ABC-stacked multilayers can be ﬁngerprinted with
a characteristic electronic Raman scattering response, which persists even at room temperatures.
Tracing the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of the inter Landau level excitations from this domain gives
strong evidence to the existence of a dispersionless electronic band near the Fermi level, characteristic
of such stacking. Our ﬁndings present a simple yet powerful approach to probe ABC stacking in
graphene multilayer ﬂakes, where this highly degenerated band appears as an appealing candidate
to host strongly correlated states.

Tailoring the electronic and optical properties of lay-
ered materials by controlling the layer orientation or their
stacking order is an important possibility oﬀered by the
physics of two dimensional systems. Graphene is the
ﬁrst isolated two dimensional crystal [1] and the prop-
erties of graphene stacks, from mono- to multi-layers
(N-LG), have been intensively investigated in the last
decade [2]. The thermodynamically stable stacking of
multilayer graphene is the Bernal stacking, where the A
sublattice in one layer comes right below the B sublattice
in the other layer [3]. It was not until recently that ex-
periments on rhombohedral stacking, with an ABC layer
sequence, have been reported. ABC tri-layer graphene,
the simplest rhombohedral N-LG, have been successfully
isolated and presents a tunable band gap [4] as well as
chiral quasi-particles as evidenced from their unconven-
tional quantum Hall eﬀect [5–7].

To our knowledge, there are yet no investigations of
ABC graphene multilayers. This is mainly because of the
low abundance of this polytype in real samples. Hence,
tracing the evolution of the electronic properties of ABC-
stacked multilayers when increasing the number of layers
remains challenging. One of the intriguing predictions
about electronic properties of ABC-stacked multilayers
is that they are expected to host surface states (localized
mainly on the top and bottom layers) with a ﬂat dis-
persion near the corners of the Brillouin zone, and bulk
states with a band gap. When increasing the number of
ABC-stacked layers, the extend of the ﬂat dispersion of
the low energy bands increases, while the size of the bulk
band gap decreases [8, 9].

Notably, the surface states of ABC-stacked graphene
multilayers have been reported as topologically pro-

tected, due to the symmetry of this material [9], and
may thus resemble those well-known surface states of 3D
topological insulators [10–13]. Interestingly, due to weak
spin-orbit interaction in carbon-based systems, an even
closer analogy is found with the surface states of topolog-
ical crystalline insulators [14]. Nevertheless, in contrast
to these two families of topological insulators, the bulk
band gap of ABC-stacked graphene multilayers gradually
closes with the increasing number of atomic sheets and
bulk rhombohedral graphite may behave as a 3D topo-
logically protected semimetal [15]. The expected high de-
generacy of the ﬂat bands could lead to exotic electronic
ground states, such as magnetically ordered phases or
surface superconductivity [16–18]. Experimental signa-
tures of this ﬂat bands has been recently observed in scan-
ning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) and angular-resolved
photo emission spectroscopy (ARPES) investigations of
nanometer scale domains of ABC-stacked graphene mul-
tilayers (5 layers) grown on 3C-SiC [19].

In this Letter, we demonstrate, using Raman scatter-
ing techniques, that ABC-stacked multilayers (N > 5)
can be found within exfoliated N-LG ﬂakes. They have
characteristic signatures in their Raman scattering re-
sponse, which allow for their identiﬁcation at room tem-
perature. These signatures include a change of the 2D
band feature line shape [20], together with an additional
Raman scattering feature which we attribute to elec-
tronic Raman scattering (ERS) across the band gap in
the bulk. ABC-stacked domains can thus be identiﬁed
by spatially mapping the Raman scattering response of
diﬀerent ﬂakes. Experiments performed with an applied
magnetic ﬁeld (B) reveal two distinct series of electronic
inter Landau level excitations, involving the low energy

surface ﬂat bands, and the bulk gapped states, respec-
tively. Experimental results are explained in the frame of
a tight binding (TB) model of the electronic band struc-
ture of rhombohedral N-layer thin graphite layers [21, 22].

The 7 parameters TB model developed by Slonczewski-
Weiss and McClure [23, 24] for bulk graphite can be
simpliﬁed by only considering the two ﬁrst intra- and
inter- nearest neighbors hopping parameters γ0 and γ1,
respectively (Figure 1f-i). The calculated low energy
band structure of ABC N-LG is shown in Figure 1a-c,
for N = 3, 8 and 15 layers. Two characteristic evolutions
when increasing the number of ABC-stacked layers arise
from these calculations: (i ) the ﬂat part of the low en-
ergy E±
0 bands (red bands in Figure 1a-c) extends over
a larger k-space region, and (ii ) the energy separation
Eg between the E±

creases and ultimately closes for rhombohedral graphite
(see Figure 1d).

A natural way of exploring electronic band struc-
tures of solids is to apply a magnetic ﬁeld in order to
induce Landau quantization, and to trace the evolu-
tion of inter Landau level excitations with a magneto-
spectroscopy techniques, such as magneto-Raman scat-
tering spectroscopy. The evolution with magnetic ﬁeld
of the four lowest in energy bands of a N = 15 ABC
stacked sequence is presented in Figure 1e. One can
note that Landau levels are formed from the ﬂat bands
(red lines), and that their energies grow nearly linearly
with the magnetic ﬁeld, but starting from a ﬁnite on-
set magnetic ﬁeld. For N = 15, the onset ﬁeld is close
to B ∼ 3 T, as indicated by blue bar in Figure 1e. As
a consequence, inter-Landau level excitations within the

linearly with the applied magnetic ﬁeld, however with a
rather unusual extrapolated negative energy oﬀset (see
supplementary information). We anticipate that this will
be the magneto-Raman scattering signature of electronic
states with such dispersion. Landau levels in the E+
1 and
E−
1 bands (green lines in Figure 1e) also show a non triv-
ial evolution when increasing the magnetic ﬁeld. From
±γ1 eV at the K-point, their energies ﬁrst decrease (in-
crease) with the magnetic ﬁeld until they reach ±Eg/2,
respectively. For higher magnetic ﬁelds, their energies in-
crease (decrease) with a quasi linear evolution. Thus, in-
ter Landau level excitations involving these states (green
arrows) are expected to ﬁrst decrease in energy down the
gap value, and to grow in a linear way for higher magnetic
ﬁelds.

An optical photograph of the investigated ﬂake is pre-
sented in Figure 2a. The ﬂake is produced from the me-
chanical exfoliation of bulk graphite and transferred on
a SiO2(90nm)/Si substrate patterned with holes in the
oxide (see Methods). The Raman scattering signal from
the suspended parts is enhanced due to an optical inter-
ference eﬀect in the substrate [25, 26]. The N-LG ﬂake
covers ﬁve diﬀerent holes labelled h0 to h4, where it is
suspended. The ﬂake has been characterized by atomic
force microscopy (AFM) measurements which indicate
a thickness of 15 to 17 layers (see supplementary infor-
mation). Raman scattering spectra are then measured at
room temperature with 50x objective and a λ = 632.8 nm
laser excitation, or at liquid helium temperature in a
solenoid using a homemade micro-magneto-Raman scat-
tering (MMRS) spectroscopy set-up with a λ ∼ 785 nm
laser excitation (see Methods).
In both experiments,
piezo stages are used to move the sample with respect to
the laser spot and to spatially map the Raman scattering
response of the ﬂake, or to investigate speciﬁc locations.
Two characteristic Raman scattering spectra measured
at h0 (black curve) and at h4 (orange curve) are pre-
sented in Figure 2b. One can recognize on these spectra
the characteristic phonon response of sp2 carbon, includ-
ing the G band feature around ∼ 1580 cm−1, and the 2D
band feature observed around ∼ 2700 cm−1 when mea-
sured with 632.8 nm excitation.
If the spectrum mea-
sured at h0 corresponds to that of thin AB-stacked lay-
ers [27], the spectrum measured at h4 is notably diﬀerent,
even though the thicknesses of the layer at these two lo-
cations are similar:
i) the G band energy at h4 is blue
shifted by 2 − 3 cm−1 with respect to that measured at
h0 (Figure 2c, ii) the 2D band line shape is more com-
plex with two additional contributions indicated by ar-
rows in 2d, and iii) an additional broad feature (Figure 2e
is observed at h4 around 1805 cm−1 with a full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of ∼ 180 cm−1. These are the
three main Raman scattering signatures of ABC-stacked
graphene multilayers.

To study the homogeneity of the N-LG ﬂake, we have

4

performed spatial mappings of the Raman scattering re-
sponse at room temperature, with 2µm spatial steps.
When scanning the surface of the ﬂake, it appears that
the broad Raman scattering feature is observed in a large
domain and that its central position can change from one
location to another (see Figure 2f). As will be clariﬁed in
the following by the magneto-Raman measurements, we
interpret this feature as arising from an electronic excita-
tion between two E±
1 bands of the band structure of ABC
N-LG. Similar to metallic carbon nanotubes [28] and bulk
graphite [29], electronic excitations do contribute to the
room temperature Raman scattering response of ABC-
stacked N-LG. The diﬀerent locations on the ﬂake where
this ERS signal is observed are presented in the form of
a false color spatial map in Figure 2h. The modiﬁed line
shape of the 2D band is also observed at diﬀerent loca-
tions on our ﬂake, shown in Figure 2g. The correlation
between these two false color maps is a strong indication
that the observation of the ERS feature and of the modi-
ﬁed 2D band line shape are signatures of the same, ABC
stacking. This ﬂake is hence composed of two distinct
domains: the ﬁrst is ABA-stacked, and is extending over
h0, h1 and h2, while the other is ABC-stacked, extend-
ing over h3 and h4. The energy of this ERS (i.e., the
bulk band gap in Figure 1a-c depends on the number of
ABC-stacked layers, and, taking the extreme values of
the ERS energy from the measured Raman spectra all
over the ABC domain, we estimate the number of ABC-
stacked graphene layers to vary from ∼ 12 to ∼ 17 over
the whole ﬂake. This feature is also observed at low tem-
perature, as can be seen in Figure 3a.

Characteristic MMRS spectra measured at h4 are pre-
sented in Figure 3b, for diﬀerent values of B. The cen-
tral position of the broad ERS feature increases with in-
creasing magnetic ﬁeld and its intensity seems to vanish
for B > 15 T. The fact that magnetic ﬁelds can inﬂu-
ence so much the energy and amplitude of this feature
is in line with an electronic origin for this excitation.
Above B > 5 T a series of sharp features, dispersing with
the magnetic ﬁeld, appears in the Raman scattering re-
sponse. They have a symmetric line shape, in contrast
to electronic excitations observed in bulk graphite [30].

The evolution of the Raman scattering response with
magnetic ﬁeld, measured at h3 and h4, are presented
in Figures 3c-d, respectively, in the form of false color
maps of the scattered intensity. These two locations
show a similar response. The observed electronic exci-
tation spectrum in magnetic ﬁeld is composed of a series
of features linearly dispersing with increasing magnetic
ﬁeld and of the ERS observed at B = 0, that acquires
a ﬁne structure at ﬁnite B. The linearly dispersing fea-
tures, in line with magneto-Raman scattering selection
rules in graphene [31] or in graphite [30], can be at-
tributed to symmetric (∆|n| = 0, where n is the Lan-
dau level index) inter Landau level excitations within
the E±1
bands and they represent the strongest con-

are not directly seen but they eﬀectively couple to the

onance and to the associated anti-crossings when they
are tuned in resonance with the G band energy [31, 32].
Such anti-crossings are indicated by red arrows in the
B-diﬀerentiated color map of h4, presented in Figure 3f.
The detailed analysis of the magneto-phonon resonance
in ABC N-LG is beyond the scope of this paper. Of
much weaker intensity, Raman scattering features with
an energy decreasing when increasing the magnetic ﬁeld
are observed (red marked regions in Figure 3d-e. These
features are better seen in Figure 3e, that shows the
B = 0 subtracted false color map of h3. They correspond
to symmetric (∆|n| = 0) inter Landau level excitations
within the lowest E±1
1 bands in the bulk. The energy of
such excitations ﬁrst decreases with the magnetic ﬁeld as
long as the Landau levels are conﬁned in the cone of the
corresponding band structure at B = 0 (Figure 1c) and
then, when the inter Landau level energy spacing reaches
the value of the energy gap in the bulk, they merge with
the broad ERS feature.

The evolution of these two families of electronic ex-
citations with increasing magnetic ﬁeld is grasped by
our tight-binding analysis. We ﬁrst determined the cen-
tral positions of the diﬀerent observed excitations using
Lorentzian functions, and searched for the parameters
entering the model to best describe our data. From this
modelling, we can determine the number of layers to be
N = 14 and 15 for h3 and h4, respectively (Figures 4a-b),
while we set γ0 = 3.08 eV and γ1 = 0.39 eV, as observed
in bulk graphite [30, 33–35]. In a simple approach (see
supplementary information), we calculated the electronic
excitation spectrum [31, 36, 37] and its evolution when
applying a magnetic ﬁeld. These results are compared to
the experimental evolution in Figures 4c-d for h4. The
model reproduces the main observed features.
In par-
ticular, the electronic excitation observed at B = 0 is
reproduced and arises indeed from an inter band elec-
tronic excitation that loses its spectral weight when the
magnetic ﬁeld is increased, transforming into inter Lan-
dau level excitations with their characteristic negative
energy dispersion.
We report the observation of electronic excitations in
N-LG system, which includes a large domain of ∼ 15
ABC-stacked layers. The analysis of its low energy elec-
tronic excitations with magnetic ﬁeld can be understood
in the frame of a tight-binding model with three parame-
ters, the number of ABC-stacked layers and the intra-
and inter-layer nearest neighbors hopping integrals γ0
and γ1. Such stacking has a unique signature in its Ra-
man scattering response at B = 0, in the form of a low
energy electronic excitations across the band gap in the
bulk. The ERS response is also observed at room tem-
perature. The central position of the ERS is related to

7

the number of ABC-stacked layers which can then be de-
duced using simple Raman scattering spectroscopy. Our
ﬁndings underscore the rich physics hidden in graphene
multilayers with ABC stacking, namely the existence of
electronic bands with a ﬂat dispersion (diverging den-
sity of states) localized on the surface, and of electronic
states in the bulk with an energy gap that depends on
the number of layers. These results represent an impe-
tus for other studies targeting the highly correlated sur-
face states, which may lead to emergent exotic electronic
ground states on this system, such as magnetic order or
superconductivity.

METHODS

The measured ﬂake was obtained from the me-
chanical exfoliation of natural graphite.
It was then
transferred non-deterministically on top of a undoped
SiO2(90nm)/Si substrate on top of which an array of
holes (∼ 6µm diameter) was etched by means of optical
lithography techniques. Room temperature Raman char-
acterization is performed on the ﬂake, using a helium-
neon laser source of λ = 633 nm (i.e., E = 1.95 eV).
To probe the Landau levels dispersion in our ABC N-
LG ﬂake, we used an experimental set-up comprising a
homemade micro-Raman probe that operates at low tem-
peratures and high magnetic ﬁelds. The excitation source
was provided by a solid state Titanium doped sapphire
laser. The excitation wavelength ﬁxed at λ = 785 nm
(i.e., E = 1.58 eV) is brought to the sample by a 5µm
core mono-mode optical ﬁber. The end of the Raman
probe hosts a miniaturized optical table comprising a set
of ﬁlters and lenses in order to clean and focalize the
laser spot. A high numerical aperture lens is used to fo-
calize the laser light on the sample, which is mounted
on X−Y−Z piezo stages, allowing us to move the sample
relative to the laser spot with sub-µm accuracy. The
non-polarized backscattered light is then injected into
a 50 µm multi-mode optical ﬁber coupled to a mono-
chromator equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled charge
coupled device (CCD) array. The excitation laser power
was set to ∼ 1 mW and focused onto a ∼ 1µm diam-
eter spot. The resulting intensity is suﬃciently low to
avoid signiﬁcant laser induced heating and subsequent
spectral shifts of the Raman features. The probe is then
placed in a resistive magnetic equipped with a liquid He
cryostat at 4 K. The evolution of the Raman spectrum
with magnetic ﬁeld was then measured on the freestand-

ing parts by sweeping the values of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Each spectra was recorded for a δB = 0.15 T in order to
avoid any signiﬁcant broadening of the magnetic depen-
dent features line-widths. The details of the theoretical
description of the LLs and the magneto-Raman spectrum
are given in the supplementary information.
