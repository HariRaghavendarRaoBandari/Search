QCD and related gauge theories have a sign problem when a θ-term is included; this complicates the ex-
traction of physical information from Euclidean space calculations as one would do in lattice studies. The sign
problem arises in this system because the partition function for conﬁgurations with ﬁxed topological charge Q,
ZQ, are summed weighted by exp(iQθ) to obtain the partition function for ﬁxed θ, Z(θ). The sign problem
gets exponentially worse numerically as the space-time volume is increased. Here it is shown that apart from
the practical numerical issues associated with large volumes, there are some interesting issues of principle. A
key quantity is the energy density as a function of θ, ε(θ) = − log (Z(θ)) /V . This is expected to be well
deﬁned in the large 4-volume limit. Similarly, one expects the energy density for a ﬁxed topological density
˜ε(Q/V ) = − log (ZQ) /V to be well deﬁned in the limit of large 4-volumes. Intuitively, one might expect
that if one had the inﬁnite volume expression for ˜ε(Q/V ) to arbitrary accuracy, that one could reconstruct
ε(θ) by directly summing over the topological sectors of the partition function. We show here that there are
circumstances where this is not the case. In particular, this occurs in regions where the curvature of ε(θ) is
negative.

INTRODUCTION

A.

θ dependence

Due its nonpertubative structure, the vacuum of Quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) and other nonabelian gauge theories
is complicated. Accordingly, it is important to understand this
vacuum structure by studying how the vacuum responds when
conditions are altered. This paper focuses on the effects of
changing the so-called θ term. The QCD Lagrangian density
has the form :

L = ¯ψ(iγµDµ − m)ψ −

where Gµν is the ﬁeld strength tensor; the last term is often
omitted. It is the so called θ term; the θ parameter is sometime
referred to as the vacuum angle. In Euclidean space, it is as-
sociated with a winding number Q, called topological charge,
which is given by

The integer Q equals the difference in the number of right-
handed and left-handed zero modes of the Dirac operator ac-
cording to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem[1]. The θ term
violates CP, so the parameter θ measures the amount of CP-
violation in QCD and QCD-like theories. Since Q is quan-
tized for any conﬁguration, the θ dependence of any physical
observable is periodic in 2π; thus, it is useful to restrict our
attention to θ between −π and π. The case of θ = π is partic-
ularly interesting since formally it is CP conserving—under
CP transformations θ → −θ but π and −π are 2π apart and
by periodicity are equivalent.

The θ term is of both theoretical and experimental interest
because for many reasons, not the least of which because it
breaks both P and CP. On the theoretical side, the study of
θ dependance is important as it gives an important probe on
how the theory responds to a P and CP violating probe. It is
interesting to know, for example, whether CP is spontaneously
broken in a particular theory at θ = π. There are limiting
cases where there are good reasons to believe that Dashen’s
phenomenon, the spontaneous broken of CP symmetry at θ =
π[2] can occur. This is believed to happen for example in
pure Yang-Mills in the large Nc limit, [3, 4] or in QCD with
Nf = 2 degenerate light ﬂavors with a mass small enough so
that leading term in chiral perturbation theory dominates[5].
A critical issue for standard model physics is that, while
CP violation has been observed in the electroweak sector, no
CP violating effects have been observed in strong interactions.
Precise measurements of the electric dipole moment of the
neutron have put the upper bound of the theta term at about
10−9 away from the CP conserving point [6–8]. The problem

2

key point here is that the fact that an Nc of three might be suf-
ﬁciently large to push the system out of the small mq regime
so far as the behavior at θ = π is concerned.

To illustrate the issue, consider Fig.1. In this ﬁgure the form
of ε(θ) is given for the inﬁnite Nc limit and for the leading
nontrivial term in the chiral expansion. To simplify the com-
parison (and all comparisons in this paper) we give ε(θ) di-
vided by the topological susceptibility, χ0 = ∂2ε(θ)
∂θ2 |θ=0; we
also set ε(0) to zero. It is clear that both curves have discon-
tinuities in the slope at θ = π and thus both break CP sponta-
neously. However, it is also clear that the two curves are quite
different in the regime near θ = π. Thus, in the regime where
mq is small and Nc is simultaneously large, one expects QCD
to interpolate between these two in some manner that depends
on how close the system is the two limits. Now, while it is
clear that each of these limits has a discontinuity in the slope
at θ = π, it is not clear a priori that the interpolating function
also does. It is easy to envision a scenario in which all of the
interpolating curves are smooth everywhere with no disconti-
nuity in the slope at θ = π but which have a curvature at π that
increases as the limiting cases are approached and diverge at
the limits yielding the sharp forms seen.

why θ is so tiny, so that the CP-violation is not observed, is
known as the strong CP problem[9]. Attempts to solve the
strong CP problem by invoking physics beyond the standard
model remains a central problem in contemporary physics;
however, it is beyond the scope of this paper.

However, from the perspective of QCD itself, there is a
related issue. While CP violation is known to be small in
QCD, one still cannot rigorously rule out the possibility that
θ ≈ π rather than θ ≈ 0. The upper bound of |θ| < 10−9
is ﬁxed since the value of θ is proportional to CP violation,
which, in turn ﬁxes the neutron electric dipole moment experi-
ment. The electric dipole moment is experimentally bounded.
However, we know θ = π is also formally CP invariant, so
|θ − π| < 10−9 may also not be in conﬂict with the experi-
mental results. This seems quite unlikely since lattice calcula-
tions done with θ = 0 appear to describe the world quite well.
However, in the absence of lattice studies at θ = π, as logical
matter one cannot rule out the possibility that the θ = π re-
sults for most observables are close enough to θ = 0 results
that θ = π is not excluded.

One could easily rule out θ = π if CP is spontaneously
broken at θ = π[2]. Thus, it would be very useful to
know whether QCD (and other gauge theories) spontaneously
breaks CP at θ = π. If CP is spontaneously broken, then the
energy density as a function of θ, ε(θ) will have a discontinu-
ity in its slope at θ = π, or to be more precise, it will develop
such a discontinuity in the limit that the inﬁnite volume limit
is taken. As noted above, there are regimes where sponta-
neous CP violation is expected to occur at θ = π, such as a
regime of inﬁnite Nc or sufﬁciently small quark mass with two
or more ﬂavors. We note, however, that while both of these
cases act to suggest that QCD with three colors and physical
quark masses spontaneously breaks CP at θ = π, they are by
no means deﬁnitive.

For example, Witten points out that in the large Nc limit,
ε(θ) is parabolic as higher terms in the curvature are supressd
by factors of 1/Nc, and the periodicity condition forces the

subtracted off. Dashed line is at the large Nc limit and solid line is
at leading nontrivial order in a chiral expansion for two degenerate
light ﬂavors.

Given the importance of understanding the energy depen-
dence of the vacuum as a function of θ, it is natural to explore
the prospects of calculating it directly from QCD using lattice
methods. As is well known, there is no practical way to do
this due to the so-called sign problem. This is generally con-
sidered as a practical problem associate with the natural algo-
rithms to compute the energy density. In this paper, we note
that the there is in an interesting theoretical issue connected to
the sign problem.

function to be deﬁned piecewise as minPk (θ− 2πk)2 [3, 4].

This leads to a discontinuity at θ = π. However, one could
imagine the following scenario: at very large but ﬁnite that
the curve is very nearly a perfect parabola, except in a region
of a size which goes to zero as Nc goes to inﬁnity where the
curve rapidly turns over. In such a scenario, the inﬁnite Nc
theory has a discontinuity and spontaneously breaks CP while
for any ﬁnite Nc CP is unbroken. Similarly, near the chiral
limit—where the ﬁrst nontrivial term in the chiral expansion
dominates— it has been shown that the energy density, peri-
odic in 2π, is proportional to (1−cos θ
) in θ ∈ [π, π], where
Nf identical to the number of degenerate light quark ﬂavors
[5]. This automatically yields Dashen’s phenomenon, a dis-
continuity at θ = π, when Nf ≥ 2. This may seem to be
compelling since, in the real world mq is small. However, one
might worry that although small, mq may not be negligibly
small. This worry stems in part from the fact that the behavior
at large Nc and small mq are qualitatively different, implying
that the large Nc limit and the small mq limits do not com-
mute. This is hardly surprising, there are many places in QCD
where the large Nc and chiral limits do not commute[10]. The

B. A sign problem

Before outlining the key issues, it is useful to deﬁne the
quantities of interest. We do so in Euclidean space, the natural
setup for lattice studies and for simplicity of discussion work
in the continuum limit here. We note in passing that there
are subtleties associated with topology when considering the
continuum limit of a discrete lattice[11–14]. However, these
are unrelated to the issues discussed in this paper. The energy
density of the QCD θ-vacuum can be given in terms of the
QCD partition function in Euclidean space Z(θ, V ) as:

where we deﬁne topological charge density q ≡ Q
V with it un-
derstood that qV is an integer, so ε(θ) and ˜ε(q, V ) are related
by:

One expects that the energy density should be an intensive
property that depends on the intensive quantity q = Q

one expects a well-deﬁned inﬁnite volume limit, so that we

where SY M and Q are functionals of the gluon ﬁeld conﬁgu-
rations on a space-time region of volume V .

We consider the Euclidean-space theory conﬁned to a box
of four dimensional space-time volume V = LxLyLzLt. Ul-
timately we are interested in inﬁnite volumes. However, for
practical calculations on a lattice one must use a ﬁnite V and
then take it to be large enough to reduce the effect of ﬁnite
volume effects and estimate, with some accuracy, their size.
The boundary conditions imposed on lattice are often taken to
be periodic for boson ﬁelds and anti-periodic for fermions.

It is well-known that Z(θ, V ) can be written as a Fourier
series over partition function ZQ(V ) with ﬁxed topological
charge Q:

Z(θ, V ) = XQ∈Z ZQ(V ) eiθQ

ZQ(V ) =

where the integration is performed over all ﬁeld conﬁgurations
on lattice with a given topological charge Q.

The quantity ZQ(V ) allows us to deﬁne a new energy den-

sity distribution function:

˜ε(q, V ) = −

log(Z(qV )(V )),

Clearly, we would like to be able to compute ε(θ) directly
from QCD. If we could, we could potentially rule out deﬁni-
tively, the possibility the θ = π by showing explicitly that CP
is spontaneously broken at θ = π. Ideally, we could answer
the question of whether this happens by doing lattice studies
at non-zero θ. However, lattice studies at θ away from zero
are not practical and as a result ε(θ) of real QCD remains un-
known. The reason they are not is because of a so called sign
problem.

The core of the problem is the oscillatory nature of the func-
tional integrand in Eq. (4) or equivalently the terms in the sum
in Eq. (5). Such integrals or sums involve large cancellations
which lead to the loss of a considerable amount of accuracy.
This problem also makes the standard Monte Carlo methods
impractical: functional integrals with an oscillatory integrand
suffers from an integration weight which is not necessarily
positive, and in this case normal sampling methods are not
practical. Indeed, for this problem the sign problem implies
that the computation cost is exponentially large as a function
of V .

It is worth recalling why the sign problem implies exponen-
tially expense in terms of computer resources. For simplycity
we consider the difference between ε(π) and ε(0). It instruc-
tive to separate the Q = 0 term from the rest and rewrite
Eq. (9) as

and B(V ) ≡ −

Q=1(−1)QZQ(V )
Z(θ = 0, V )

(cid:19)

(11)

where the factor of 2 and sum over positive Q in the deﬁni-
tion of B(V ) reﬂects the fact that CP invariance implies that

˜ε(cid:16) −Q

V , V(cid:17) = ˜ε(cid:16) Q

well known fact [16] that

V , V(cid:17). In deriving Eq. (11), we used the

lim
V →∞ZQ=0(V ) = lim

V →∞Z(θ = 0, V ) ,

(12)

The Eq. (12) implies that A(V ) is a subexponential function
of V . This in turn implies that in order to capture the differ-
ence between ε(π) and ε(0), B(V ) must cancel A(V ) to one
part in exp (V (ε(θ) − ε(0))). If one assumes that these dif-
ferences in ε are of order unity, one sees that to extract the en-
ergy dependence via a direct summation of the Fourier series,
requires cancellations due to the ﬂuctuating sign that scale ex-
ponentially in the volume. This in turn, implies that to get a
meaningful result one would need to compute both A and B
with an accuracy that also scales exponentially in the volume.
But, in a Monte Carlo algorithm the accuracy scales as the
square root of the resources so to get sufﬁcient accuracy using
a Monte Carlo algorithm in each Q sector and summing over
sectors requires resources which scale exponentially with the
volume.

This exponentially serious sign problem implies that the as
a practical matter, simply using Eq.(9) to get ε(θ) is not prac-
tical except for very small systems that are well away from
describing the inﬁnite volume result in 3+1 dimension. A sim-
ilar exponentially serious sign problem also occurs QCD with
a nonzero chemical potential. Some possible solutions has
been proposed to evade these sign problems[17–26]. Among
all of these proposals, using an imaginary chemical potential
has generated signiﬁcant attention.[27, 28]. Similarly, calcu-
lating imaginary θ ﬁrst and then analytically continue it to
real θ in order to avoid sign problem has been used to calcu-
late deconﬁnement temperature, electric dipole moment and
so forth[29–34]. In practice, analytic continuation from imag-
inary θ to real θ can be done for real θ fairly near 0. This is
because when θ is very small, using any reasonable expansion
form of energy density, we can neglect higher order terms in
the expansion and only take the several lowest order terms as
an approximate analytical form in which to extrapolate to real
θ. However, because we lack knowledge of the exact form
for energy density ε(θ) in real QCD, it is not not practical to
analytically continue imaginary θ to an arbitrary real θ ∼ π,
where we have no reason to expect high order terms to be neg-
ligible.

To pose this issue mathematically let us deﬁne the quantity

The new notation ε(θ) is used to distinguish it with ε(θ) de-
ﬁned in Eq. (9). The deﬁnitions of ε(θ) and ε(θ) differ only
in an ordering of limits. In ε(θ), ˜V is taken to inﬁnity prior
to taking V to inﬁnity, while in ε(θ) the limits are taken si-
multaneously. The question, then amounts to whether or not
ε(θ) = ε(θ).

As noted above, it seems rather plausible that ε(θ) = ε(θ)
since it relates one intensive quantity to another. As it turns
out that in principle, one can fully reconstruct ε(θ), from ˜ε(q)
via directly summing over topological sectors for cases in
which ε curves upward (i.e. ε′′(θ) > 0) everywhere in the
region −π < θ < π. Such cases are interesting since they
must spontaneously break CP at θ = π due to a discontinuity
in the slope (as in the examples in Fig. 1). However, it turns
out that if, ε(θ) has regions for which ε′′(θ) < 0 , then, as a
result of the severe sign problem, even perfect knowledge of
˜ε(q) is insufﬁcient to reconstruct those regions. Remarkably,
in these cases, in order to fully reconstruct the inﬁnite volume
behavior for ε(θ) one needs to understand the ﬁnite volume
effects for ˜ε(q, V ).

This paper is organized as follows. In the follow section we
demonstrate the phenomenon in the context of a simple “toy”
problem, that while not being QCD, illustrates the issues. The
toy problem is one for which a dilute instant gas is a valid
approximation. It is found that in the region where ε′′(θ) > 0,
ε(θ) = ε(θ). The key analysis in understanding this behavior
is analyzed the subsequent section. It is that the relevant sums
can be approximated as integrals that can be analyzed in terms
of a saddle point approximation to the relevant integral. The
argument is generalized in the next section; it is shown that
the phenomenon can be expected to occurs when ε′′(θ) ≤ 0
with no restriction to the dynamics of the toy problem. The
paper concludes with a discussion of these these results.

The sign problem is generally thought of as a practical dif-
ﬁculty that prevents practical calculations of ε(θ). However,
there is also an under appreciated theoretical question asso-
ciated with the sign problem that is the focus of this paper.
The issue is the following: suppose that one is able to de-
termine ˜ε(q) with arbitrary accuracy, does this give us enough
information, in principle, to reconstruct ε(θ) by summing over
topological sectors? Intuitively, it may seem obvious at ﬁrst
blush that the answer is yes. After all, both quantities are
thought to be intensive and thus to be well deﬁned in the
inﬁnite volume limit. Thus, it seems highly plausible that
while the two intensive quantities depend on each other, nei-
ther should depend on ﬁnite volume corrections. However, as
will be shown here, things are a bit more subtle than this.

II. A TOY PROBLEM: THE DILUTE INSTANTON GAS

A.

ε(θ) versus ε(θ)

It is well known that neither Yang-Mills nor QCD can be
approximated well by a dilute instanton gas[35]. Neverthe-
less, we are going to ﬁrst consider a dilute instant on gas with
instantons of ﬁxed action and ﬁxed size as a toy model to il-
lustrate the underlying issues. We envision such a model as
arising from some unspeciﬁed theory (not necessarily in 3+1
dimensions), which has instanton and anti-instanton classical
solutions and an analog of the θ term and in some parametric
limit the theory becomes semi-classical and is dominated by
widely spaced instantons of ﬁxed size.

In such models, it is well known that ZQ(V ) is obtained by

summing over the effects of instantons and antiinstantons

from which the standard dilute instant gas expression[36] for
ε(θ) follows:

5

ZQ(V ) = Z0

∞

Xn=0(cid:0) 1

2 c e−S0V(cid:1)|Q|+2n
n! (n + |Q|)!

= IQ(ce−S0V ) (14)

where Z0 is a prefactor that sums up effects other than instan-
tons, S0 is the action of a single instanton, V is the space time
volume, and c is a constants with dimension 4 that includes
the effects of ﬂuctuations. The sum yields the modiﬁed Bessel
function IQ(ce−S0V )

From this is it simple to identify ε(θ). For integer Q

IQ(z) =

1

2π Z π

−π

ez cos θ cos(Qθ)dθ

(15)

which from Eq. (5) implies that

Z(θ) = Z0 exp(cid:0)ce−S0V cos(θ)(cid:1)

(16)

ε(θ) = ε0 + χ0(1 − cos(θ))

with χ0 ≡ ce−S0, and ε0 ≡ − log (Z0)

V

(17)

− ce−S0 .

Next let us consider ˜ε the energy density associated with
ﬁxed topological sectors. Previously it was argued that this
should be an intensive quantity which depends only on q =
Q/V . Let us verify that this is true for the dilute instanton gas
model. Start with ZQ given in Eq (14) and exploit the series
expansion of the modiﬁed Bessel function Iν (νz) around the
the uniform limit ν → ∞ through positive real values,

Iν (νz) ∼

where Uk(p)s are polynomials in p of degree 3k with U0(p) equal to unity[37]. This yields

˜ε(q, V ) = ε0 + χ0 + q log  q +pχ2
Thus, in the limit V → ∞ with ﬁxed q:

(20)

As advertised, ˜ε is an intensive quantity only dependent on
q, a result previously derived in [16] for the analogous case
of QCD with one light ﬂavor which also has a cosinusoidal
dependance of ε(θ).

Before proceeding, it is useful to note that the form of ˜ε(q)
as a mapping of real numbers to real numbers is unique. How-
ever, if we continue to the complex q plane, as we will have
cause to do later, the functional form is multi-branched with
branch points at ±iχ0 and branch cuts extending along the
imaginary axis to inﬁnity. The imaginary axis is free of a
branch cut only for −χ0 < iq < χ0. The form of ˜ε(q) used
here corresponds to the principal branch.

With knowledge of ˜ε, we are in a position to investi-
gate whether it is sufﬁcient to determine ˜ε. To do so we
must calculate ε(θ), deﬁned in Eq. (13) and ask whether it
agrees with ε(θ). The calculation of ε(θ) involves evaluating
V )V eiθQ. Unfortunately, we know of no way to do

PQ e−˜ε( Q

this analytically so the calculation of ε(θ) was done numeri-
cally with the large V limit approximated by V being taken
large enough so that V χ0 ≫ 1 (the results were quite stable
except in the immediate vicinity of θ = π/2 by V χ0 = 30).
In Fig. 2, ε(θ) and the numerically calculated ε(θ) with are
plotted in units of the topological susceptibility.

There are several things to notice about Fig. 2. The ﬁrst
is that for 0 < θ < π/2 one sees that up to the quality of
the numerics, ε(θ) = ε(θ). However, for π/2 < θ < π,
ε(θ) 6= ε(θ). This demonstrates quite clearly that the an-
swer to the question of whether knowledge of ˜ε(q) is sufﬁ-
cient to reconstruct ε(θ) via direct summation over topolog-
ical sectors—is, “it depends.” The focus of the reminder of
this paper is on what does it depend. Before attacking this
question, a couple of other observations are in order. The ﬁrst
is that to numerical accuracy, it appears that ε(θ) is linear in
the region in the region π > θ > π
2 . Beyond, θ = π is linear
with the opposite slope, yielding a discontinuous slope.

The point that separates the region for which ε(θ) = ε(θ)
from the region for which ε(θ) 6= ε(θ) appears from the nu-
merics to be θ = π/2—or something very close to it. Assum-
ing that the point really is exactly at θ = π/2, gives rise to the
issue of what makes that point special. An obvious conjecture
is that θ = π/2 is a point of inﬂection. As will be seen in
the course of this paper, there is very strong evidence that this
conjecture is correct.

B. The severity of the sign problem

One thing illustrated quite clearly by the different energy
densities in Fig. 2 for our toy problem, the dilute instanton
gas, is just how serious the sign problem can be. As one
approaches the inﬁnite volume limit the fractional difference
between ˜ε(q) and ˜ε(q, V ) clearly goes to zero in the inﬁnite
volume limit. However, even as this difference becomes van-
ishingly small at large volumes, their associated energy func-
tions of θ, ε(θ) and ε(θ) respectively become very different
for θ > π
2 . Before turning to more realistic situations it is
worth exploring why this is so for the toy problem.

To understand how this vanishingly small difference in the
dilute instant on gas results in order unity differences between
ε(θ) and ε(θ), it is important to ﬁrst recognize that the key
quantities in the calculations are not the energy densities but
the generating functions, Z ∼ exp(−V ε). Note, that the
correction term of order 1/V in the expansion of ˜ε(q, V ) in
Eq. (20), leads to an order unity shift in ZQ. One might be
tempted to ascribe the order unity differences between ε(θ)
and ε(θ) to these differences. However, the underlying cause
is more subtle than this.

To see this, it is instructive to compute the θ dependence
using various approximations to ˜ε(q, V ) including various or-
ders of correction in 1/V and truncating beyond it. We de-
ﬁne ˜εn(q, V ) as an approximation to ˜ε(q, V ) that includes all

that is, it is the standard deﬁnition expect that it replaces
˜ε( Q
V , V ) and thereby includes some ﬁxed level
of 1/V corrections. The εn(θ) can be computed numerically
using a large but ﬁnite value for the volume.

If the the explanation for the difference between ε(θ) and
ε(θ) were due to the order unity difference in the generat-
ing functions arising from the 1/V corrections in ˜ε(q, V ),
one would ﬁnd that up to numerical accuracy εn(θ) would
be equal to ε(θ) for all n ≥ 1. However, this is not the case.
In Fig. 3, ε(θ), ε2(θ) and ε(θ) are plotted. It is immediately
apparent that ε2(θ) 6= ε(θ) differs substantially from ε(θ) co-
inciding only in the region 0 < θ < π/2; indeed it coincides
with ε(θ). Why, then, does ε(θ) differ from ε(θ)?

Ultimately the answer resides in the discussion associated
with Eq. (11). Note that to obtain ε(θ) accurately, one requires
cancellations what are exponentially sensitive with respect to
the volume. Thus, it is not that surprising that inclusion of
any given level of power law correction in the volume might
be insufﬁcient. However, if this is the case, then why does
ε(θ) equal ε(θ) in the regime where |θ| < π/2? The next
section is aimed at answering that question in the context of
this toy model.

III. SADDLE POINT APPROXIMATION FOR THE

INSTANTON GAS MODEL

A. A useful Identity

To proceed, we will exploit a powerful identity relating the
limit of integrals and sums which holds for a wide class of
functions f (x) that goes positive inﬁnity as the x → ±∞
along the real axis :

λ(cid:1)(cid:1) exp(iθ x)
λ(cid:1)(cid:1) exp(iθ n)

which holds for a large class of functions, f , for −π < θ < π.
The importance of this identity to our problem is that at large
V the sumPQ e−˜ε( Q
V )V eiθQ can be replaced by an integral
over Q, which is far easier to study analytically. The identity
is not trivial. Of course, one expects that a sum will converge
to an integral in situations where the limit of the sum yields
Reimann’s construction for integrals. However, that does not
happen here. Note that the cases of interest to us here are ones
in which the ﬁrst term in the sum is exponentially larger than
than the total even as the limit is approached.

The derivation of the identity is straightforward but is worth
sketching here as it illustrates some key features of the prob-
lem that we will exploit later. The ﬁrst step is to notice that

assuming that the various integrals and sums all converge. The
last form of Eq. (24) is instructive. Integrals of this form in the
limit of large λ are typically accurately approximated via the
saddle point approximation assuming appropriate analyticity
properties[38]. Up to power law factors in λ, the kth integral
is given by

parts of f (y(t)) + i(θ + 2πk) y(t) have to vanish at the sad-
dle point. The key point is that each integral is exponentially
dominated by its minimum saddle point in the complex plane
as λ becomes large.

Thus, for a wide class of functions, one expects that at large
λ, the sum over k to be exponentially dominated by the term
with the smallest value of gk. For many typical cases one
expects this to be the k = 0 term for −π < θ < π. In these
cases, as θ goes beyond π, one expects that the k = −1 term
to take over as the dominant term, as θ exceeds 3π the k=-2
to take over and so forth. If one focuses on the the region
−π < θ < π for these typical cases, the sum at large λ is
exponentially well approximated by the k = 0 term. However,
from the middle line of Eq. (24), the k = 0 term is precisely
the integral in the numerator of Eq. (23) which establishes
Eq. (23) for this class of function.

There is an important subtlety. The saddle point approxi-
mation is obtained by distorting the path of the integral from
along the real line to some other path with the same end points
in the complex plane. The integrals will coincide provided the
integrand is analytic everywhere in the region enclosed by the
two paths. Distorting the path through saddle points along
paths with steepest decent allows one to show that the region
near the saddle point dominates the the integral exponentially–
at least locally–and thereby justify the approximation. Saddle
points are not the only points that can exponentially domi-
nate the integrals. Suppose the function, f is not analytic ev-
erywhere, but has a branch cut singularity. In that case, the
branch point can act in a manner quite analogous to a saddle
point and the argument given above goes through with minor
changes. In particular, it is easy to see that circumstances can
arise such that integration paths that are distorted to go around
a branch point in f and are arbitrarily close to the branch cut
on each side can be exponentially dominated at large λ by
the contribution in the immediate vicinity of the branch point.
When this happens the branch point plays the same basic role
as a saddle point in that the value of the function at the branch
point can determine the value of the integral up to subexpo-
nential factors. Note that there may be more than one branch
point and the relevant branch point may be determined by the
need to close contours at inﬁnity.

Assuming that Eq. (23) holds, it can be exploited in com-
puting ε(θ). We can replace the sum over Q by an integral in
computing since we are taking the inﬁnite volume limit. Thus,

On physical grounds one expects dominant saddle points

to be on the imaginary axis in q:

imaginary q. Note, moreover, that ˜ε(q) is an even function.
This means that wherever ˜ε(q) is analytic along the imaginary
axis (˜ε(q) − iθq) will be real along the imaginary axis–i.e.
have a constant phase of zero. Thus, the condition for a sad-
dle point at q = iq0 is

The up shot of this, plus the last equality in Eq. (27 ) is that
in the inﬁnite volume limit, one expects ˜ε to be related to ε by
an analog of a Legendre transformation—but with a critical
factor of i:

Equation (29) is central to the analysis. One key point is,
that by its structure Eq. (29), requires ε(θ) and ˜ε(q) contin-
ued into the complex plane. It is also important to recall the
limitations of Eq. (29). Its validity requires: i) that ˜ε(q) is ana-
lytic for at least some region along the imaginary axis; ii) that
the k = 0 integral in Eq. (24) is dominated by a saddle point
along the imaginary axis and iii) that the identity in Eq. (23)
holds for ˜ε(q) + iθq which follows if the sum on k in Eq. (24)
is exponentially dominated by the k = 0 term at large V .

B. The saddle point approximation for the dilute instanton gas

for |θ| < π/2

Let us return to the dilute instanton gas and focus on what
the saddle point approximation tell us about the relationship
of ε(θ) to ε(θ) for the regime |θ| < π/2 . We will start by
assuming that the conditions justifying Eq. (29) hold and see
what that implies. Subsequently, we will argue that these con-
ditions should hold.

Let us test the hypothesis that in the regime |θ| < π/2,
ε(θ) = ε(θ), which for the dilute instanton approximation is
given by ε(θ) = ε0 + χ0 (1 − cos(θ)). If this hypothesis is
correct, then ∂ε
∂θ = χ0 sin(θ), and the ﬁrst form of Eq. (29)
becomes

Note that we have shown previously that for the dilute instan-

˜ε (iχ0 sin(θ)) = ε0 + χ0 (1 − cos(θ)) − χ0 sin(θ)θ
0 + q2 + q sinh−1(cid:16) q

ton gas, ˜ε(q) = ε0 + χ0 −pχ2

∂θ = iχ0 sin(θ) in this yields

χ0(cid:17). In-

serting q(θ) = i ∂ε

(30)

˜ε (iχ0 sin(θ))

= ε0 + χ0(1 −p1 − sin(θ)2 − χ0 sin(θ) sin−1 (sin(θ))
= ε0 + χ0 (1 − cos(θ)) − χ0 sin(θ)θ

(31)

8

where the second equality holds for |θ| < π/2 where
sin−1 (sin(θ)) = θ and p1 − sin(θ)2 = cos(θ). Thus, in
the domain |θ| < π/2, the lefthand side of Eq. (30) is in-
deed equal to the right and the hypothesis that ε(θ) = ε(θ)
is consistent—providing the assumptions underlying Eq. (29)
hold.

This demonstration of consistency in hardly surprising: it
justiﬁes the empirical observation in Sec. II based on the nu-
merical results of direct summation with large volumes that
ε(θ) = ε(θ) in the regime |θ| < π/2. Of course, the demon-
stration here depends on the assumption that the three condi-
tions justifying Eq. (29) hold. Condition i), the existence of a
region along the imaginary axis where ˜ε(q) is analytic clearly
holds for the form derived for the dilute instanton gas: ˜ε(q)
is analytic from −i χ0 to i χ0. It is also highly plausible the
condition ii) holds. There is a saddle point at q = iχ0 sin(θ).
Condition iii), that the k = 0 integral dominates the sum
over k in Eq. (24) requires a bit of care. It is easy to see that
there are no saddle points along the imaginary axis for any of
the integrals associated with k 6= 0. If saddle points exist for
k 6= 0, then the second form of Eq. (29) with the substitution
θ → θ + 2πk would determine them. Thus,

θ + 2πk = −i

Using ˜ε(q) = ε0 + χ0 − pχ2

means that

θ + 2πk = sin−1(cid:18)i

qsp

χ0(cid:19) .

(33)

Recall that we are considering qsp on the imaginary axis so
that iqsp is real and that ˜ε(q) corresponds to the principal
branch of the function which forces the derived sin−1 to also
correspond to the principal branch and thus to take value from
2 to π
− π
2 . This in turn means that for −π < θ < π there
are only saddle points on the imaginary axis for k = 0 and
− π
2 < θ < π
2 .
Since physically one expects any dominant saddle point to
be on the imaginary axis and there are no saddle points for
k 6= 0 along the imaginary axis, it is highly plausible that the
integrals k 6= 0 are dominated by regions near branch points.
Thus for these cases

where qbp is the branch point and for convenience we have
introduced the symbol εk(θ). For the dilute instant on gas at
qbp = ±iχ0. The relevant branch point is determined by the
sign of θ + 2πk, since one wants to close contours at inﬁnity.
Thus, for k 6= 0 with the dilute instanton gas,

εk(θ) = ε0 + χ0 + χ0|θ ±

+ 2πk| .

(35)

Note that in the domain |θ| < π
2 , εk(θ) for k 6= 0 is always
greater than than ε(θ) = ε0 + χ0(1 − cos(θ)(which was de-
termined (from the saddle point of the k = 0 integral). This
means the k 6= 0 integrals are exponentially suppressed at
large volumes compared to the k = 0 and can be neglected,
which establishes condition iii).
To summarize, for |θ| < π

2 it has been shown self-
consistently that at large volumes for the dilute instant on gas,
the sum over Q can be replaced with an integral, this integral
is dominated by a saddle point on the imaginary axis and that
saddle point approximation to the integral yields ε(θ) = ε(θ).
This is consistent with the what was observed empirically by
direct numerical summation.
It also agrees with the naive
intuition that ε(θ) ought to be directly obtainable from ˜ε(q)
via direct summation over topological sectors given that both
functions are intensive and independent of the volume.

C. The saddle point approximation for the dilute instanton gas

for π/2 < |θ| < π

Let us consider what happens when we try to extend the
analysis based on the saddle-point approximation to the k =
0 integral for the dilute instanton gas in the regime, π/2 <
It should be clear that the approximation breaks
|θ| < π.
down. The easiest way to see this is is to repeat the analysis
at the beginning of Subsection III B. That is one can assume
that ε(θ) does equal ε(θ). As in the |θ| < π/2 case, one
obtains Eq. (30) and the ﬁrst equality of Eq. (31). However,
the second equality in Eq. (31) fails for π/2 < |θ| < π since
sin−1 (sin(θ)) = ±(π− θ) (where ± is chosen to be the same
as the sign of θ) rather than θ andp1 − sin(θ)2 = − cos(θ)
rather than cos(θ). Thus it implies that
˜ε (iχ0 sin(θ)) = ε0 + χ0 (1 + cos(θ)) − χ0 sin(θ)(π − θ)
(36)

6= ε0 + χ0 (1 − cos(θ)) − χ0 sin(θ)θ

where the second form is ˜ε (iχ0 sin(θ)) as given in Eq. (30).
This is a clear inconsistency and implies that the starting as-
sumption that ε(θ) = ε(θ) does not hold in this regime.This
analysis shows why in the regime π/2 < |θ| < π, the intu-
itive notion that ε(θ) obtained from direct summation ˜ε(q) in
the inﬁnite volume limit should be equal ε(θ) fails do to an
extremely severe sign problem.

There is an equivalent way to see this by working directly
from Eq. (33) which holds for k = 0 as well as k 6= 0. By
the same logic that the k 6= 0 integrals were shown not to
have saddle points in the regime |θ| < π/2, we can see that
there are no saddle points for k = 0 when π/2 < |θ| < π.
Equation (33) tell us that at saddle point on the imaginary
axis for the k = 0 integral for the dilute instanton gas when

θ = sin−1(cid:16)i qsp
χ0(cid:17) and the sine inverse is in its principle
branch. Since the principal branch of the inverse sign has
a range from −π/2 to π/2 this can never be satisﬁed when
|θ| > π/2. Thus, there are no saddle points on the imaginary
axis in this regime.

9

In the absence of saddle points one expects the integrals to
be dominated by the appropriate branch points. The analysis
of these is the same as for the k 6= 0 integrals in the previous
subsection in the discussion accompanying Eqs (34) and (35).
As in that case, the branch points occur at qbp = ±iχ0 and the
appropriate branch point is ﬁxed by the need to close contours
at inﬁnity. The result in this regime is as given in Eq, (35),
namely that ε(θ) = ε0 + χ0 + χ0|θ ± π
2|. This conﬁrms that
ε(θ) 6= ε(θ) in this regime and is also consistent with what
was observed numerically: ε is a linear function of θ in this
regime. It is easy to see by the same type of analysis as done
in Subsection III B, that in this regime εk(θ) for k 6= 0 is
always greater than than ε(θ) and thus the k = 0 integral is
exponentially dominant at large V .

To summarize: for π/2 < |θ| < π it has been shown that
there are no saddle points on the imaginary axis and the dom-
inant k = 0 integral is dominated by a branch point. This
yields a linear relationship:ε(θ) = ε0+χ0+χ0|θ± π
2| 6= ε(θ).
This result is consistent with the what was observed empiri-
cally by direct numerical summation. Moreover, it shows why
the naive intuition that ε(θ) ought to be directly obtainable
from ˜ε(q) via direct summation over topological sectors given
that both functions are intensive and independent of the vol-
ume fails.

D. Analytic Considerations

Note that the sign problem at large volume can be viewed
as an issue in analytic continuation. In the region |θ| < π/2
where we can reconstruct ε(θ) from ˜ε(q) via direct summa-
tion, the calculation of ε(θ) amounts to analytically contin-
uing ˜ε(q) to the imaginary axis and identifying the saddle
points.
In this context, the sign problem can be viewed as
thought of as the difﬁculty in doing this analytical continua-
tion numerically based entirely on exponentially sensitive nu-
merical knowledge ˜ε(q) on the real axis.

Issues associated with analyticity are also at the heart of an
apparent puzzle. Note that the analysis of the previous sub-
section and the numerical studies of the previous section both
indicate that knowledge ˜ε(q)—even if perfect—is insufﬁcient
to fully reconstruct ε(θ) in the regime π/2 < θ < π via direct
summation over topological sectors for the dilute instant on
gas. Despite this, the question of whether exact knowledge of
˜ε(q) is sufﬁcient to reconstruct the full function ε(θ) for all
θ is somewhat subtle. Recall that the numerical evidence and
the analysis based on the saddle point approximation indicate
that for |θ| < π/2, the knowledge of ˜ε(q) is sufﬁcient to re-
construct ε(θ) . If we are able to fully reconstruct ε(θ) for
|θ| < π/2 from ˜ε(q), one could in principle use the functional
form obtained for ε(θ) in the regime |θ| < π/2 to analytically
continue into the region |θ| > π/2. Moreover for the dilute
instanton gas, the function is known to be analytic along the
real axis and there is no obstruction to analytically continuing
from ε(θ) into the regime π/2 < |θ| < π. Thus it seems as
though the information contained in ˜ε(q) should be sufﬁcient
to reconstruct the full function ε(θ).

How can one reconcile the inability to reconstruct ε(θ) from

˜ε(q) via direct summation with the fact that ˜ε(q) contains
enough information to reconstruct it? The answer lies in the
analytic structure of ˜ε(q) in the complex plane. Recall that
the functional form of ˜ε(q) given in Eq. (20), while a uniquely
deﬁned function if viewed as a mapping from reals to reals, is
multi-branched as a function complex q to complex ˜ε. Indeed,
the branch points of this function played in a key role in the
study of the regime π/2 < |θ| < π. The form we found ˜ε(q)
by studying it along the the real axis corresponds to the prin-
cipal branch of this function. However, the functional form
˜ε(q) “knows” about all of its branches since one can analyti-
cally continue from one branch to the next.

Consider, what happens to the function ˜ε(q) if one follows it
from a point on the real axis along a path through the complex
plane around the branch point at q = iχ0 a single time and
back to the same point on the real axis evolving the function
along the path via the Cauchy-Riemann equations. One will
not obtain the same value for the function–its value on the
principal branch but rather the value of the function along a
different branch. More generally, as soon as the path crosses
the branch cut one moves onto a new branch. We will denote
the functional form for the branch we obtain in this process as
˜˜ε(q); it is given by

˜˜ε(q) = ε0 + χ0 +qχ2

0 + q2 + q(cid:18)iπ − sinh−1(cid:18) q

χ0(cid:19)(cid:19) .

(37)
where the inverse hyperbolic sine is taken in its principal
branch; the shift to a new branch of the inverse hyperbolic
sine is reﬂected by a ﬂipped sign and the presence of the fac-
tor of iπ. It is worth noting that while ˜ε(q) was obtained by
studying the behavior along the real q axis and produced a real
function, this new branch is not real for real q. Thus, it can-
not be obtained directly by taking the large V of ˜ε(q, V ) with
q real (as it will be in lattice studies); it require an analytic
continuation.

It is easy to verify that if one uses this branch instead
of the principal branch ˜ε(q) when computing the stationary
phase integral for the regime π/2 < θ < π then the re-
sults are indeed self consistent and one reconstructs ε(θ) =
ε0 + χ0 (1 − cos(θ)). One can similarly verify numerically
that directly over topological sectors using ˜˜ε(q) at large vol-
ume also reproduces ε(θ) = ε0 + χ0 (1 − cos(θ)) with high
accuracy. This indicates the sense in which the functional
form ˜ε(q) contains the information to fully reconstruct ε(θ).
It is clear that fully reconstructing it for some region of θ de-
pends on using a particular branch of the function. To recon-
struct the full function one needs to use multiple branches—
matching the appropriate branch to a given region of θ. On
the other hand, the only way we know how to extract these
branches is via analytic continuation. The bottom line, then is
that while ˜ε(q) contains information to fully reconstruct this
information is in a form that is inaccessible when doing a di-
rect sum over topological sectors.

10

IV. THE GENERAL CASE

Up to this point, we have focused on a toy model—the di-
lute instant on gas. We have done so since it was solvable
and hence it is possible to verify ones’ analytic conclusions
against direct numerical evaluations at large volume. The real
importance of the toy model is that the analysis of it can serve
as a paradigm for how to study cases which are not solvable
in closed form.

The key point is that the analysis was given in the preceding
section holds far more generally than for the dilute instanton
gas. It was shown there that when there exists a saddle point
along the imaginary q axis for ˜ε(q) − iqθ then ε(θ) = ε(θ)—
i.e.the direct summation over topological sectors using the in-
ﬁnite volume extrapolation for the energy density as a function
of winding number density—gives the correct inﬁnite volume
extrapolation of the energy density as a function of θ. This
will hold generally.

(39)

When the integral in Eq. (38) has a saddle point qsp for a
particular range of θ, according to Eqs. (29), one should have
ε(θ(qsp)) = ˜ε(qsp) − iθ(qsp)qsp and θ(qsp) = −i ∂ ˜ε(qsp)
∂qsp .
Since ˜ε(q) = lim
is
V →∞
also true, which in turns means Eq. (39) also has a saddle
point at the same value of q as Eq. (38) at inﬁnite volume limit.
Then ε(θ(qsp)) = lim
˜ε(qsp, V ) − iθ(qsp)qsp = ε(θ(qsp)),
V →∞
so that ε(θ) = ε(θ) is true in this general case if one assume
there is a saddle point for the integral in Eq. (38).

˜ε(q, V ), θ(qsp) = −i lim

When there is no saddle point for integral in Eq. (38), we
know the branch point will play the similar role as the saddle
point, but for Eq (39), the previous argument cannot be used
here because there is no branch point.

The Legendre-like relations of Eqs. (29) will , in general,
hold if a saddle point exists regardless of the other details of
the system. This means that for a general θ dependence we can
use Eqs. (29) to probe the conditions for which a saddle point
exists and hence determine conditions for which ˜ε(q) can be
used to reconstruct ε(θ) via direct summation over topological
sectors.

The principal result is that for cases where ε(θ) is analytic

for real θ between −π and π one generically has

ε(θ) = ε(θ) if

|θ| < θmax

where θmax is the smallest positive value of θ satisfying either
of the following conditions

= 0 .

1. d2ε(θ)

dθ2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)θ=θmax

2. θmax = π .

Moreover, if condition 1 is satisﬁed, i.e. there is a point of in-
ﬂection, in general ε(θ) 6= ε(θ) for some region of |θ| > θmax
(typically extending either to θ = π or the next point of in-
ﬂection, while if condition 2 is satisﬁed then ε(θ) is not ana-
lytic at θ = π, (typically with a discontinuous ﬁrst derivative
as in Fig. 1.) This means that whenever there is a point of
inﬂection in ε(θ) the sign problem is so severe that even ex-
act knowledge of ε(θ) is insufﬁcient to reconstruct ε(θ) direct
summation over the full range of θ.

Note that this behavior is precisely what is seen for the di-
lute instant on gas, where ε(θ) equals ε(θ) before the point of
inﬂection at θ = π/2 and ceases to be equal beyond the point
of inﬂection.

These conditions can be obtained by requiring self-
consistency. One starts by assuming that ε(θ) = ε(θ) and
then determines where this relation fails. We start by noting
that if ε(θ) = ε(θ) holds for small |θ| then we expect that the
the integral determining ε(θ) is ﬁxed by a saddle point and
not a branch point. Were it a branch point than ε(θ) would be
linear at small θ but since it is even would have to be propor-
tional to |θ|. This is inconsistent with the hypothesis that ε(θ)
is analytic from −π to π. Thus, one expects ε(θ) = ε(θ) to
continue to hold so long as the saddle point approximation re-
mains valid and to fail when the approximation breaks down.
This breakdown occurs at a branch point beyond which the
saddle point ceases to exist. The branch points are easy to
identify; ˜ε(q) ceases to be analytic along the imaginary axis
at the branch points.

A key identity allows to identify the branch points and es-
tablish the conditions where ε(θ) = ε(θ). The identity is
that whenever ε(θ) = ε(θ) and there exists a saddle point
of ˜ε(q) + iqθ along the imaginary i axis, then

vergence signals that ˜ε(q) ceases to be analytic at this point—
precisely as one expects if a branch point is encountered there.
Although the branch point represents non analytic behavior in
˜ε rather than ε, it is clearly a point at which ε(θ) becomes
nonantalytic since the function becomes linear beyond the
branch point. This necessarily spoils the equality between
ε(θ) and ε(θ) since, by hypothesis ε(θ) is analytic between

down of the condition ε(θ) = ε(θ) without an inﬂection point
in ε(θ). The concern stems from the possibility that higher
derivative could diverge signal the nonanalyticity even if the
second derivative remains ﬁnite. One would expect such be-
havior, If for example ˜ε(q) had a contribution proportional
to χ3/2
; the second derivative remains ﬁnite as
q → iχ0 but the third derivative diverges as do all higher
derivatives. However, we can rule out this possibility if ε(θ)
is analytic between −π and π.

The conclusion of this analysis is that one expects that
when ε(θ) has a point of inﬂection somewhere in the domain
−π < θ < π, for part of the domain the sign problem is so

severe that one cannot obtain ε(θ) by directly sum over topo-
logical sectors using ˜ε(q), the ﬁnite volume limit of ˜ε(q, V ).
We tested this conclusion numerically by constructing numer-
ous hypothetical forms ε(θ) that contained points of inﬂection
for which we could obtain ˜ε(q). Using these extracted ˜ε(q)
we found in all cases that there were regions of θ beyond the
point of inﬂection for which we could not reconstruct ε(θ) by
summing over topological sectors.

V. CONCLUSION

This paper explored a subtlety in the relationship between
the inﬁnite volume limit and the sign problem in the context
of theories with a θ term. It was shown that there exist cir-
cumstances for which the sign problem is so severe that for
some values of θ one can cannot obtain the correct inﬁnite
volume ε(θ) by summing over topological sectors using the
exact inﬁnite volume form for ˜ε(q). This occurs when ε(θ)
has a point of inﬂection between −π and π. This can be taken
as an illustration of just how serious sign problems can be.
However, it is also worth stressing that there are regions in θ
where ˜ε(q) is sufﬁcient to obtain ε(θ) by direct summation. In
some ways this is quite remarkable. After all, there are power
law differences in the volume between ˜ε(q, V ), ˜ε(q) which
translates into order one errors in ZQ, while one requires the
sum over Q to yield cancellations which are accurate up to
exponential accuracy in V since individual terms ZQ is expo-
nentially larger than the sum Z(θ). Thus, one requires some
type of conspiracy for these order one errors not to spoil the
cancellations. Ultimately, the reason why ˜ε(q) turns out to be
sufﬁcient in these cases is that the sum over topological sec-
tors can be rewritten as a sum of integrals, which at large V
are exponentially dominated by a single integral which in turn
may be well approximated using the saddle point method.

analysis concerns the analytic structure of the inﬁnite volume
functions ε(θ) , ˜ε(q): unless both functions are trivially con-
stant, at least one of these is not analytic over the entire com-
plex plane. Recall that θ and q have something of a conjugate
relationship with each other up to a key factor of i. We found
that in cases where ε(θ) had a point of inﬂection that ˜ε(q) had
place where it was not analytic. The branch point in ˜ε(q) was
approached as the point of inﬂection was approached in ε(θ).
Thus, the only way that ˜ε(q) can be analytic everywhere from
pi to π is for ε(θ) to have no inﬂection points in the entire
region; i.e. to have positive curvature. However, if this is the
case, then periodicity in θ implies discontinuity of the slope at
θ = nπ, which is clearly non analytic.

While this paper has focused on a theoretical issue, the
analysis may prove of value in extracting information about
ε(θ) from practical lattice calculations. Note that given the
sign problem, current techniques are not sufﬁcient to directly
compute ε(θ) . However, one might hope that the determi-
nation of whether or not ε(θ) is in some qualitative class of
functions might be accessible via a study of ˜ε(q) or equiva-
lently ε(iθ). This possibility will be explored in future work.
