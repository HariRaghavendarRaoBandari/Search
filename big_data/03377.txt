Motivated by the high superconducting transition temperature of monolayer FeSe on SrTiO3, we
propose a potential three-dimensional high temperature superconductor superlattice FeSe–SrTiO3
and study its structural stability and electronic structure using density functional theory. We ﬁnd
that the binding energy between the FeSe and SrTiO3 layers is about ∼0.7 eV per (Fe2Se2) unit
and that it saturates already within a single TiO2 atomic layer of SrTiO3. In addition we analyzed
the dynamical stability of the superlattice and compared it to the case of bulk SrTiO3.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The discovery of superconductivity in single unit cell
thick FeSe grown on the TiO2-terminated surface of
SrTiO3 (1 UC FeSe/STO)1 is remarkable in several re-
spects. Not only is the superconducting gap opening
temperature Tgap = 55–75 K estimated from angle-
resolved photoemission spectroscopy2–7 (ARPES) the
highest among all iron-based superconductors, it also has
the simplest electronic structure. These ﬁndings have
motivated many theoretical studies.8–12 Recently the mu-
tual inductance measurement made on a sample showing
a 65 K gap opening temperature in ARPES exhibited
an onset of a Meissner eﬀect at the same temperature.13
This largely removed the long standing doubt of whether
the energy gap measured by ARPES is caused by super-
conductivity.

In the bulk form, FeSe has a Tc of only 8 K
at ambient pressure,14 and it peaks at 37 K under
pressure.15–17 This temperature is close to Tc ∼ 30 K
found in AxFe1−ySe at optimal doping with A be-
ing either K, Rb, Cs, or Tl.18 A recently discovered
bulk crystal consisting of FeSe layers intercalated with
Li1−xFexOH again has a similar transition tempera-
ture of ∼ 41 K.19,20 For potassium coated three mono-
layer FeSe on SrTiO3 (Kx(FeSe)3/STO) ARPES shows
that the gap opens around 48 K.21–23 All of the latter
three superconductors have the same electronic struc-
ture as the 1 UC FeSe/STO, but their Tc is considerably
lower. This raises the question concerning the mecha-
nism for the Tc enhancement in the 1 UC FeSe/STO.
The fact that the measured Fermi surfaces of AxFe1−ySe,
(Li1−xFexOH)FeSe, and Kx(FeSe)3/STO are nearly iden-
tical to that of 1 UC FeSe/STO suggests that the reason
for the enhanced Tc is likely the close proximity of FeSe
to SrTiO3.

It is suggested in Ref. 7 by one of us and collabora-
tors that the origin of the enhancement from 30–40 K to
55–75 K is the coupling between the FeSe electrons and
SrTiO3 phonons. On the other hand, the three other au-
thors focused (Ref. 8) on the role of the intrinsic coupling

of the FeSe electrons to the FeSe phonons beyond the
conventional density functional theory approach. Now
we brieﬂy discuss the roles of SrTiO3 phonons and FeSe
phonons in these two studies.

According to Ref. 7 the phonons in the SrTiO3 enhance
the intrinsic Tc from 30–40 K to 55–75 K (see Ref. 9 for
a review). Moreover due to the small momentum trans-
fer nature of the electron-phonon interaction the cou-
pling to the SrTiO3 phonons enhances Tc regardless of
the intrinsic pairing symmetry, as veriﬁed by a recent
minus-sign-free quantum Monte-Carlo simulation.24 The
evidence for a strong coupling between the FeSe electron
and the SrTiO3 phonon and its small momentum transfer
nature is provided by the replication of all low-binding
energy bands approximately 100 meV away, in the di-
rection of higher binding energies. This replication was
interpreted as a phonon shake-oﬀ eﬀect7,25 and is con-
sistent with the presence of ∼ 100 meV optical phonon
band in SrTiO3,26–28 and similar replica of the surface
bands of the (001) surface of pure SrTiO3.29

Regarding the contribution of FeSe phonons to pair-
ing, early local-density approximation calculations30,31
on related materials estimated this contribution to be
too small to explain the experimentally found transition
temperatures. On the other hand in Refs. 8 and 32 it is
found that the strength of this interaction may have been
severely underestimated in the early theoretical work.
The reason for this underestimation in earlier work is
attributed in Ref. 8 to a tendency of a local-density ap-
proximation to underestimate the shearing (also called
nematic, orthorhombic) instability relative to experiment
in iron-based superconductors, as well as to strongly re-
duce the density of states at the Fermi level.
In addi-
tion, scanning tunneling microscopy features33 found in
1 UC FeSe/STO are consistent with the calculated FeSe
phonon spectral function8 as well as with the kinks in
the ARPES spectra on a similar material.34

In the present work we set aside the superconduct-
ing pairing mechanism intrinsic to FeSe and the validity
of either of the above two suggested mechanisms.7,8 In-
stead we focus on proposing bulk materials composed of
stacked FeSe-SrTiO3 interfaces for possible further en-

hancement of Tc. Thus our purpose here is to study the
structural stability and electronic structure of a novel
bulk material, ﬁrst proposed in Ref. 9, in which FeSe
layers are bonded from both sides by TiO2 terminated
layers of SrTiO3. Our motivation is to double the in-
terface between FeSe and SrTiO3, relative to the case
of 1 UC FeSe/STO. Due to the exponential sensitiv-
ity of Tc to the pairing strength, this may lead to a
even larger Tc enhancement.7,9 In addition, the three-
dimensionality of the proposed material should sup-
press the superconducting phase ﬂuctuation in the two-
dimensional 1 UC FeSe/STO (such phase ﬂuctuation is
observed in Ref. 13).

II. METHODS AND RESULTS

We now discuss the results of our density func-
tional
theory (DFT) based ﬁrst-principles calcula-
tions of the FeSe-SrTiO3 superlattices performed us-
ing the Quantum-ESPRESSO package.35 Most of our
calculations use the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof36 (PBE)
exchange-correlation functional. However, for a more ac-
curate determination of the binding energy we use the
vdW-DF237 functional that includes van der Waals inter-
actions. The ultrasoft pseudopotentials used are from the
GBRV38 library with 40 and 200 Ry kinetic energy cut-
oﬀs for the electron wavefunction and the charge density.
The Gaussian smearing is set to 13 meV and 143 k-point
grid is used. To correct the band gap of SrTiO3 we apply
Hubbard +U correction on Ti atom with U = 6 eV which
gives a Γ point energy gap of 3.0 eV in bulk SrTiO3.
Electron doping is compensated with a uniform positive
background, to keep the computational unit cell neutral.
All structural relaxation is done without electron doping.
It is important to note that certain features of ARPES
measured band structure of 1 UC FeSe/STO and re-
lated FeSe based superconductors are not well repro-
duced by a conventional DFT calculation. Some aspects
of the measured band structure are better captured by
DFT calculation assuming a non-magnetic (NM) ground
state while others agree with assuming a checkerboard
anti-ferromagnetic (c-AFM) ground state. In particular,
ARPES ﬁnds no hole pockets at the zone center and two
pockets at the M point. In DFT there are no hole pockets
at the zone center in the c-AFM case (and not in NM)
while there are two pockets at the M point in the NM
case (and not in c-AFM). However, structural stability,
the main focus of this work, is largely the same in the
NM and the c-AFM states as we demonstrate later in
this paper.

A. Structure

We focus here on structures where FeSe is on both
sides interfaced with TiO2 terminated surfaces of SrTiO3,
both because that is a signiﬁcantly lower energy interface

(0.65 eV versus 0.44 eV per Fe2Se2 formula unit for n =

FeSe on SrTiO3 was observed for this type of interface.
While bulk SrTiO3 contains equal numbers of TiO2 and
SrO layers, our proposed superlattice contains exactly
one more TiO2 layer than the number of SrO layers. The
repeat unit of our superlattice is therefore

for any positive integer n. Figure 1 shows the n = 1, 2,
and 3 superlattices we studied. The structure proposed
in Ref. 9 is the one indexed by n = 2. Table I shows the
binding energies and other structural parameters. We
computed the binding energy by comparing the energy
of the entire superlattice with that of isolated FeSe and
isolated SrTiO3 slab with the same number of layers and
the same in-plane lattice constants.

1. Binding energy

As shown in Table I the binding energy of the super-
lattice per one Fe2Se2 formula unit is nearly independent
of n for n > 1. We ﬁnd it to equal 0.79 eV for the
thinnest superlattice (n = 1) and 0.65 eV for two thicker
cases (n = 2, 3). Therefore we conclude that the cohesive
energy between the FeSe and SrTiO3 components of the
superlattice is reached already within a single TiO2 layer.
Similar trend is found for the structural parameters such
as the in-plane lattice constant, the selenium height, and
the distance between FeSe and TiO2 layers (see Table I).

The binding energy is given both with and without van der Waals interaction in the non-magnetic (NM) and the checkerboard

non-magnetic state. The remaining quantities are calculated without van der Waals correction in the c-AFM state.

In the lowest energy structure, Se atoms in the FeSe
layer are directly above/below the Ti atoms in the TiO2
layer. For this reason, the lowest energy structure is in
the body centered tetragonal phase (see Fig. 1). In the
primitive tetragonal phase, where Se is above/below Ti
on only one side of FeSe, the binding energy per Fe2Se2
unit is reduced from 0.65 eV to 0.61 eV (in the n = 3
case).

Comparing the relaxed in-plane lattice constant of the
superlattice, we ﬁnd that it is larger than that of isolated
FeSe monolayer and smaller than that of bulk SrTiO3
(Table I), with the exception of n = 1 case. As expected,
when n increases the lattice constant of the superlattice
approaches that of bulk SrTiO3.

We ﬁnd nearly no eﬀect of the magnetic ground state
on the cohesive energy of the superlattice. As shown in
the second and third columns of Table I the binding en-
ergy without the van der Waals interaction of the super-
lattice in the NM and c-AFM state diﬀer only between
30 and 50 meV.

2. Ferroelectric instability

Bulk SrTiO3 is known to be on the verge of a fer-
roelectric instability.
Its dielectric constant is nearly
divergent39 at low temperatures (below 50 K). Den-
sity functional theory calculations without quantum

ﬂuctuations40,41 ﬁnd unstable phonon modes at the zone
center corresponding to ferroelectric distortion. These
modes are stabilized only by the inclusion of quantum
ﬂuctuation eﬀects.42

However, the surface of SrTiO3, unlike the bulk, is
known to be ferroelectric43 due to a slight displacement
(rumpling) of oxygen atoms relative to titanium atoms.
The direction of the atomic displacement is such that
the oxygen atoms are moved away from the TiO2 plane
towards the vacuum region. Our calculations show this
rumpling to be equal 0.073 ˚A on a pristine SrTiO3 sur-
face (see Table I) while it is somewhat reduced in the
FeSe-SrTiO3 superlattices to 0.046 for n = 2 and 0.054 ˚A
for n = 3. The direction of the rumpling is the same as
for the pristine SrTiO3 surface. Since the magnitude of
the rumpling distortion is so similar, we conclude that
surface ferroelectric instabilities of SrTiO3 are likely not
aﬀected much by the presence of the FeSe layer in the
superlattice.

To further compare ferroelectric instabilities in bulk
SrTiO3 and the superlattice, we computed phonon fre-
quencies in pure SrTiO3 and the n = 3 superlattice at
high-symmetry q-vectors. These frequencies are reported
in Table II and they do not include the LO-TO correction
at q = 0 (i.e.
in all cases we report transverse optical,
TO, modes only). For phonons associated with the struc-
ture instabilities, the frequencies are purely imaginary.

In bulk high-symmetry cubic SrTiO3 we ﬁnd several

into two classes: those due to a ferroelectric distortion and those due to oxygen octahedra rotations.

unstable phonon modes. For example, at the Brillouin
zone center q = (0 0 0) we ﬁnd a phonon triplet with
a frequency of 140i cm−1 corresponding to the ferroelec-
tric modes in which Ti and O atoms move in opposite
directions. At the three equivalent centers of the Bril-
louin zone faces such as q = ( 1
2 0 0) we ﬁnd a doublet
of unstable modes with a frequency of 50i cm−1 corre-
sponding to the anti-ferroelectric distortion of Ti and O
atoms.

In the n = 3 FeSe-SrTiO3 superlattice we ﬁnd
very similar frequencies of unstable ferroelectric phonon
modes ranging from 122i cm−1 to 51i cm−1, as shown in
Table II. The out-of plane ferroelectric mode is stabilized
in the superlattice (its frequency is 330 cm−1) since there
is a static ferroelectric distortion (the Ti-O rumpling) at
the FeSe-SrTiO3 interface. The anti-ferroelectric mode
in the superlattice has nearly the same frequency as in
the bulk (it is 62i cm−1 versus 50i cm−1 in the bulk). In
the superlattice case the anti-ferroelectric mode appears
at the zone center q = (0 0 0) since the primitive unit
cell of the superlattice contains three Ti atoms.

3. Rotation of oxygen octahedra

We now turn to the analysis of the remaining unsta-
ble modes corresponding to the rotation of oxygen octa-
hedra. Unlike ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric distor-
tions, oxygen octahedral distortions are not removed by
quantum ﬂuctuations and static distortion occurs in bulk
SrTiO3 at temperatures below 105 K.

In cubic bulk SrTiO3 we ﬁnd unstable modes at the
(0 1
1
2 ) point corresponding to the in-phase rotations
2
with a frequency of 7i cm−1. On the other hand, out-of-
phase octahedral rotations are even more unstable since
their frequency is 75i cm−1. Here by in-phase rotation
we have in mind a rotation in which adjacent octahedra
along the rotation axis rotate in the same sense. This
kind of rotation is also denoted as a ”+” rotation by
Glazer.44 The out-of-phase rotations are denoted as a
”−” rotation.
In the case of the superlattice the strongest rotational
instability has a frequency of 122i cm−1 and it corre-
sponds to the rotation of the oxygen octahedron in the
middle of the SrTiO3 slab around the z-axis (the z-axis
is perpendicular to the slab). Another instability with a
frequency of 60i cm−1 corresponds to the in-phase rota-
tion of octahedra around the x and y axes.

Therefore, we can conclude that all structural instabil-

FIG. 2. Comparison of band structures with varying layer index n and a ﬁxed doping level of 0.12 electrons per single Fe
atom. The right most panel shows the band structure of an isolated FeSe monolayer with a lattice constant of bulk SrTiO3
for comparison. The top row panels show the band structure in the non-magnetic (NM) case while the bottom row panels
correspond to the checkerboard anti-ferromagnetic (c-AFM) case.

ities in the superlattice are originating from the SrTiO3
layers and are present even in bulk SrTiO3. While fer-
roelectric distortions are slightly suppressed in the su-
perlattice, oxygen octahedral distortions are somewhat
enhanced (from 75i cm−1 to 122i cm−1). Therefore, we
expect that the same series of structural phase transitions
will appear in the superlattice as in the SrTiO3 slab.

B. Electronic structure

We now turn to the electronic structure of the superlat-
tices. As in the case of 1 UC FeSe/STO, we expect that
the FeSe layers in our superlattice will be electron-doped
by oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO3 layers. In fact, oxy-
gen vacancies are a common occurrence in SrTiO3 and
other perovskite oxides. To simulate the eﬀect of oxy-
gen vacancies in our calculations, we added in the cal-
culation excess electrons along with a uniform positive
charge background, to keep the computational unit cell
charge-neutral. The concentration of the added electron
density is 0.12 electrons per single Fe atom, the same as
estimated from the Fermi volume measured by ARPES
in 1 UC FeSe/STO.

The calculated band structures are shown in Fig. 2 for
the n = 1, 2, 3 superlattices. For a comparison, we also
show a band structure of an isolated FeSe monolayer but
with an lattice constant equal to that of bulk SrTiO3. In
all four cases, we show band structures in the NM and
the c-AFM states for a comparison. The band structure
near the Fermi level of all superlattices we studied are
very two-dimensional. For example we ﬁnd that the z
axis dispersion at the M-point is at most 2 meV.

of the n = 1 there is a hole-pocket at M originating from
oxygen p states at the Fermi level (even with included
electron doping of 0.12 electrons per Fe). However, as n
is increased, the top of the oxygen band moves below the
Fermi level. The energy separation between the top of
the oxygen band and the Fermi level is roughly linearly
proportional to n. Already at n = 2 we ﬁnd that the
Fermi level electronic structure is dominated by FeSe and
is nearly indistinguishable from the case of an isolated
FeSe monolayer (right most panel in Fig. 2).

III. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

The single layer of FeSe or FeAs is a common structural
motif for all iron-based superconductors. These FeSe or
FeAs layers are commonly thought to be where conduc-
tion and superconductivity occurs while the in-between
buﬀer layers serve only as reservoirs of charge and for
structure stabilization. Here we are proposing a family
of superlattices in which the in-between layers serve an
active role in the superconductivity by enhancing the su-
perconducting transition temperature Tc of the material.
We expect the Tc enhancement mechanism due to
the substrate phonons proposed in Ref. 7 to hold for
other oxides. For example earlier work found that one
can replace SrTiO3 with BaTiO3 and have a similar Tc
enhancement5 as in 1 UC FeSe/STO. This observation
is consistent with the fact that BaTiO3 has similar high
energy phonon band as SrTiO3. In addition, we expect
that the structural-template eﬀect8 on a cubic SrTiO3,
as well as doping due to oxygen vacancies, will continue
to hold for other transition metal oxides as well.

epitaxy (MBE), or pulsed layer deposition (PLD) meth-
ods. For the latter two techniques controlling the chem-
ical potential of all ﬁve elements in the superlattice (Fe,
Se, Sr, Ti, and O) and the diﬀerent growth temperatures
for FeSe and SrTiO3 pose strong challenges. On the other
hand, we expect the Tc enhancement mechanism to hold
for even binary oxides such as TiO2 (our n = 1 super-
lattice), which might be grown more easily with MBE or
PLD method.
