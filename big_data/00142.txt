ABSTRACT

In a search of the unidentiﬁed Fermi gamma-ray source 3FGL J1417.5- 4402 with the Parkes radio telescope,
we discovered PSR J1417- 4402, a 2.66 ms pulsar having the same 5.4 day orbital period as the optical and
X-ray binary identiﬁed by Strader et al. The existence of radio pulsations implies that the neutron star is
currently not accreting. Substantial outﬂows from the companion render the radio pulsar undetectable for
more than half of the orbit, and may contribute to the observed Hα emission. Our initial pulsar observations,
together with the optically inferred orbit and inclination, imply a mass ratio of 0.171 ± 0.002, a companion
mass of M2 = 0.33 ± 0.03 M⊙, and a neutron star mass in the range 1.77 ≤ M1 ≤ 2.13 M⊙. However, there
remains a discrepancy between the distance of 4.4 kpc inferred from the optical properties of the companion
and the smaller radio dispersion measure distance of 1.6 kpc. The smaller distance would reduce the inferred
Roche-lobe ﬁlling factor, increase the inferred inclination angle, and decrease the masses. As a wide binary,
PSR J1417- 4402 differs from the radio-eclipsing black widow and redback pulsars being discovered in large
numbers by Fermi. It is probably a system that began mass transfer onto the neutron star after the companion
star left the main sequence. The companion should end its evolution as a He white dwarf in a 6–20 day orbit,
i.e., as a typical binary millisecond pulsar companion.
Subject headings: pulsars: individual (PSR J1417- 4402)

1. INTRODUCTION

The Large Area Telescope (LAT; Atwood et al. 2009) on
the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been used to de-
tect 200 rotation-powered pulsars (e.g., Abdo et al. 2013)10.
Nearly half of them are millisecond pulsars (MSPs; e.g.,
Abdo et al. 2009). Half of the LAT-detected MSPs were
discovered prior to Fermi in “all-sky” radio surveys. The
other half were discovered in directed radio searches of LAT
unidentiﬁed sources (e.g., Ray et al. 2012).

These two subpopulations differ in at least one important
respect: 95% of the MSPs discovered in all-sky surveys have
white dwarf companions or are isolated. By contrast, 40%
of those discovered in LAT-guided searches are in compact
(< 1 day) interacting binaries — the so-called “black widow”
or “redback” systems. Black widow pulsars have degenerate
≈ 0.03 M⊙ companions and many are regularly eclipsed at ra-
dio wavelengths near pulsar superior conjunction. Redback
MSPs have hot and bloated main sequence-like & 0.1 M⊙
companions and display irregular radio eclipses that can per-
sist for more than half of the orbit.

Black widows have long been considered to possibly rep-

resent the ﬁnal stage in the creation of isolated MSPs, but
many uncertainties remain (e.g., Podsiadlowski et al. 2002).
How redbacks ﬁt into the recycling scenario of MSP forma-
tion, and how they may relate to black widows, is even more
uncertain (e.g., Chen et al. 2013; Benvenuto et al. 2014). No
redbacks were known in the Galactic disk prior to Fermi, and
they continue to present unexpected behavior: e.g., three red-
backs have transitioned rapidly between accretion-disk states
with no radio pulsations and rotation-powered states with
radio pulsations (Archibald et al. 2009; Papitto et al. 2012;
Stappers et al. 2014).

In this context, Strader et al. (2015) have discovered a pecu-
liar system. They report on multi-wavelength observations of
the unidentiﬁed source now known as 3FGL J1417.5- 4402,
ﬁnding a variable X-ray object associated with an optical
counterpart that displays ellipsoidal variations with a Pb = 5.4
day binary period. They interpret the observation of double-
peaked Hα emission as evidence for an accretion disk in a
low-mass X-ray binary, and conclude that the optical/IR star
is a ≈ 0.35 M⊙ giant at a distance of 4.4 kpc and that the neu-
tron star is massive, ≈ 2.0 M⊙. Strader et al. (2015) proposed
that 3FGL J1417.5- 4402 could be a transitioning MSP that
might eventually be detectable as a radio pulsar. However,
the large orbit sets PSR J1417- 4402 apart from Galactic red-
backs: all those previously known have Pb < 1 day.

Here we report the discovery and initial study of a radio
MSP that is clearly the neutron star in the 5.4 day binary
3FGL J1417.5- 4402. Although it shares some of the prop-
erties of redbacks, such as their companion masses and ex-
tensive radio eclipses, PSR J1417- 4402 is on a standard evo-
lutionary track that will end as a typical binary MSP with a
low-mass white dwarf companion, as Strader et al. (2015) de-
duced. It is the ﬁrst such system to be identiﬁed in the Galaxy.

2.1. Radio Searches at Parkes

In Camilo et al. (2015) we reported on a radio survey of 56
unidentiﬁed LAT sources using the CSIRO Parkes telescope.
We discovered 10 MSPs, in some cases only after multiple ob-
servations of each source. Multiple observations increase the
chance that an otherwise detectable pulsar will not be missed
due to interstellar scintillation, large acceleration at a partic-
ularly unfavorable binary phase, or eclipse. We established
that 23 of the remaining unidentiﬁed sources had gamma-ray
properties consistent with those of known pulsars, and there-
fore were deserving of further radio searches.

During 2015 March–May we performed 28 search obser-
vations of 12 of the highest-ranked LAT targets remaining
from our original source list (Table 1). Because the analog
ﬁlterbank used in the original survey had in the meantime
been decommissioned, we used instead a digital ﬁlterbank
(PDFB4, see Manchester et al. 2013) to record data from the
central beam of the Parkes 20 cm multibeam receiver, at a
center frequency of 1369 MHz. Each of 512 0.5 MHz-wide
polarization-summed channels was sampled with PDFB4 ev-
ery 80 µs for approximately 1 hr (see Table 1), and the result-
ing power measures were written with 2-bit precision to disk
for off-line analysis.

We analyzed the data using PRESTO (Ransom 2001), ex-
actly as for our earlier searches described in Camilo et al.
In an observation of 3FGL J1417.5- 4402 done on
(2015).
2015 March 28, we discovered a binary pulsar with period P =
2.66 ms and dispersion measure DM = 55 pc cm- 3 (Figure 1a).
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst pulsar discovered using any
of the PDFBs. We then realized that 3FGL J1417.5- 4402 was
the gamma-ray source in which Strader et al. (2015) had dis-
covered an unusual binary, and sought to determine whether
the new pulsar was related.

2.2. Timing Observations of PSR J1417- 4402

We had searched the location of the new pulsar once before
(Table 1), unsuccessfully. Following its discovery we began
Parkes timing observations at 1.4 GHz. Between 2015 March
28 and 2016 January 14 we have observed PSR J1417- 4402
52 times on 46 days for a total of 75 hr, and have detected it
for a total of 11 hr on seven days (Figure 1a–c and f–i). All of
these detections were within orbital phases 0.4 < φb < 0.65,
which we have observed for 42 hr (see Figure 2; through-

are shown twice as a function of time and summed at the top.

φb = 0 is the time of ascending node of the pulsar). Two
thirds of these observing sessions, 85% of the observing time,
and all of the detections, used the same PDFB4 setup em-
ployed in the discovery observation. The remaining timing

Figure 2. Fifty six observations of PSR J1417- 4402 on 48 days during 2015
March–2016 January as a function of orbital phase φb. Non-detections are
represented in red, blue indicates detections. The detection at φb ≈ 0.95 rep-
resents two adjoining GBT observations, at 2 GHz and 5 GHz respectively
(see Figure 1d–e). The non-detections on day numbers 16 and 20 are at
2 GHz; all other observations are from Parkes at 1.4 GHz.

observations were done with the Berkeley-Parkes-Swinburne
Recorder (BPSR), which in effect samples 340 MHz of band-
width centered on 1352 MHz every 64 µs with 0.4 MHz reso-
lution (for more details, see Keith et al. 2010).
For the relatively large DM of PSR J1417- 4402 we do not
expect interstellar scintillation to modulate the detected ﬂux
density by more than a factor of ∼ 2. Some, likely all, of the
non-detections are caused by eclipses, as in Figure 1 (pan-
els c,g,h,i). On at least two occasions (see “kinks” lasting
for ≈ 500 s near the beginning/end of the observations in Fig-
ure 1h/i) the pulse arrival is delayed by ≈ 0.15 P, presum-
ably due to an ephemeral clump of ionized material. This
time delay corresponds to an extra electron column δDM ≈
0.15 pc cm- 3.
In 2015 June we observed PSR J1417- 4402 at the Robert
C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We did this on three
days for a total of 3 hr at a central frequency of 2 GHz, record-
ing a bandwidth of 800 MHz using GUPPI11. One of these
observations resulted in a detection (Figure 1d), at φb ≈ 0.95
(Figure 2). On the same day we also did a 1 hr observation us-
ing the new GBT C-band receiver, centered at 4.8 GHz with
800 MHz bandwidth, and detected the pulsar with an esti-
mated ﬂux density of ≈ 40 µJy (Figure 1e).
Additionally, we observed PSR J1417- 4402 during 2015
April–June at Parkes at 0.7 GHz (once for 0.6 hr) and 3.1 GHz
(twice for a total of 1.3 hr), and at the GBT at 350 MHz
(three times, 0.6 hr). Finally, in a different Parkes survey of
Fermi unidentiﬁed sources, we had also observed its location
at 1.4 GHz in 2014 July (three times, 2.1 hr). None of these
observations resulted in detections.

There are currently too few radio detections to obtain a
phase-connected timing solution. However, the existing de-
tections (all of which indicated orbital acceleration) were suf-
ﬁcient to determine that PSR J1417- 4402 is the neutron star
in the Strader et al. (2015) binary: it has the same orbital pe-
riod and its phase is 180◦ shifted from that of the optical star.

(2002) (see Section 3.1).

In order to obtain the parameters listed in Table 2 we ﬁrst
extracted pulse times of arrival (TOAs) from all detections.
Using the TEMPO12 timing software we ﬁt each day’s TOAs
to a model including spin frequency and up to two deriva-
tives as needed. We then did a least-squares ﬁt of a circular
orbit (e < 0.02 according to Strader et al. 2015) to the result-
ing overall set of Doppler-shifted barycentric spin frequen-
cies. We also used TEMPO to directly ﬁt a zero-eccentricity
binary model to the TOAs, allowing for an arbitrary offset be-
tween daily sets of TOAs (i.e., the resulting solution is not
phase connected). The parameters and uncertainties given in
Table 2 encompass the sets of values returned by these two
independent ﬁts. Our scant detections currently span a nar-
row range of binary phases (Figure 2), and we expect greatly
improved orbital parameters as detections accumulate; never-
theless, our values for Pb and Tasc already have 10 times the
precision of those obtained from optical observations.

2.3. X-ray and UV Observations of PSR J1417- 4402

The Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT, Burrows et al. 2005) ob-
served PSR J1417- 4402 in 2015 March and June, for a total
of 12.5 ks. The eight observations in March spanned slightly
more than one binary orbit (Table 3). We processed all Swift
observations using FTOOLS version 6.1613. The 0.3–10 keV
spectrum and light curve from the XRT photon counting mode
data were obtained with XSELECT. The source events were
extracted from a circular aperture of radius 20 pixels (47′′),
while the background was taken from an annulus with an in-
ner radius of 60 pixels and an outer radius of 110 pixels.

The X-ray count rates appear to show variability, with a
maximum at binary phase φb = 0.55. However, the probability
that the observed counts arise from a constant ﬂux distribution
is 2.4% (determined from a χ2 ﬁt of a model with a constant
count rate to the X-ray light curve), so we cannot rule out
the null hypothesis that the ﬂux is constant. The combined
time-averaged X-ray spectrum is well-ﬁtted using XSPEC by
an absorbed power-law with photon index Γ = 1.59+0.35

10 keV ﬂux of (8.7 ± 1.5) × 10- 13 erg cm- 2 s- 1 (all uncertain-
ties in this section represent 90% conﬁdence levels). This is
consistent with the spectrum measured from a 2011 Chandra
observation (Strader et al. 2015), and corresponds to an X-ray
luminosity of ≈ 3 × 1032 (d/1.6 kpc)2 erg s- 1, which we scale
according to the DM-derived distance (see Section 3.1 for a
discussion of this).
Simultaneously with the XRT, PSR J1417- 4402 was ob-
served with the Swift ultraviolet and optical telescope (UVOT,
Roming et al. 2005), through a variety of ﬁlters. The result-
ing magnitudes and upper limits are also presented in Table 3.
The UVOT photometric measurements were obtained using
the uvotsource command in FTOOLS. The source ﬂux
was obtained from a 5′′ circle, while the background was
taken from a source-free circular region of radius 20′′. There
are two detections in u and two in uvw1. The remaining
UV observations yield only upper limits. The implications
of these will be discussed in Section 3.2.
3. DISCUSSION

one of the 10 had a well constrained distance used to con-
struct NE2001). The remaining seven objects have distances
that disagree by more than 20%, in some cases by a factor of
2. Four have NE2001 distances larger than the parallax dis-
tances and the opposite is the case for the other three pulsars.
We conclude that there is no identiﬁable distance bias in
NE2001 (as there is for TC93) and that the NE2001 distance
is the best provisional DM-based distance estimate. However,
due to possible variations in the scale height of the electron
density distribution, there is considerable uncertainty in deter-
mining DM distances to pulsars at high Galactic latitude when
DM sin |b| is comparable to its maximum value (see Figure 1
of Cordes & Lazio 2003). PSR J1417- 4402 falls in this un-
certain regime. Also, a recent study reports new MSP parallax
distances that in some cases differ from the NE2001 distances
by a factor of 2 (Matthews et al. 2016). Therefore, we do not
exclude a larger distance such as that derived by Strader et al.
(2015). The conﬂict between these independent distance mea-
surements, 4.4 kpc and 1.6 kpc, extends to the assumptions
made by Strader et al. (2015) in modeling the inclination an-
gle of the system and the masses, because the star would only
ﬁll a fraction of the Roche lobe if at the smaller DM-based
distance. These issues are discussed in Section 3.3.

3.1. What is the Distance to PSR J1417- 4402?

Strader et al. (2015) estimate that the PSR J1417- 4402 sys-
tem lies at a distance of d = 4.4 kpc (with a likely uncertainty
of at least 20%) based on the magnitude and optical spectrum
of the companion, and assuming that it ﬁlls its Roche lobe.
Given the poor pulsar detectability (generally low signal-to-
noise ratio and frequent eclipses), it is unlikely that a parallax
will be measured either interferometrically or through timing
observations. But we can estimate the distance from the ra-
dio pulsar DM. The Cordes & Lazio (2002) electron distribu-
tion model (NE2001) gives dNE2001 = 1.6 kpc, while the previ-
ously most used electron density model gives dTC93 = 3.0 kpc
(Taylor & Cordes 1993).

We favor the NE2001 distance because TC93 generally
over-predicts distances and fails to account for the DMs of
about 10% of pulsars (Cordes & Lazio 2002, and unpub-
lished reanalysis of the ATNF pulsar catalog). Of 66 pulsars
with parallax measurements14, 17 have DMs between 35 and
75 pc cm- 3 (compared to 55 pc cm- 3 for PSR J1417- 4402).
Of these, 10 have NE2001-estimated distances that are con-
sistent to within 20% of the parallax distance ranges (only

3.2. Is There an Accretion Disk?

Strader et al. (2015) concluded that an accretion disk is
present, primarily because of the double-peaked Hα emis-
sion line, but also because the X-ray luminosity at their pre-
ferred distance of 4.4 kpc is consistent with those of tran-
sitional MSPs in their disk states. The detection of radio
pulsations from PSR J1417- 4402 brings that interpretation
into question because the transitional MSPs PSR J1023+0038
(Bogdanov et al. 2015) and XSS J12270- 4859 (Hill et al.
2011) show no evidence for radio pulsations in their accret-
ing states. Along with the detection of accretion-powered
X-ray pulsations in both systems (Archibald et al. 2015;
Papitto et al. 2015), this is an indication that the radio pul-
sar mechanism of these two MSPs is completely quenched
by the accretion ﬂow (see also Cordes & Shannon 2008, and
references therein).
If the lower DM distance is adopted, the X-ray luminos-
ity of ≈ 3 × 1032 (d/1.6 kpc)2 erg s- 1 (Section 2.3) is com-
parable to ∼ 1032 erg s- 1 measured for the nearby redback
PSR J1723- 2837 (Bogdanov et al. 2014) and lower than the

MILLISECOND PULSAR IN 3FGL J1417.5- 4402

average accreting luminosity of the transitional MSPs (e.g.,
Linares 2014). Non-thermal X-rays typically observed in red-
backs seems to originate from an intra-binary shock driven by
the interaction of the pulsar wind and matter from the com-
panion (Arons & Tavani 1993). However, the uncertain dis-
tance to PSR J1417- 4402 (Section 3.1) and possible X-ray
variability (Strader et al. 2015, and Section 2.3) make existing
X-ray observations an unreliable discriminator for the pres-
ence or absence of accretion.

Even if no accretion ﬂow is reaching the neutron star and
the X-rays are not accretion powered, a disk that is trun-
cated at the magnetospheric radius or beyond could still ra-
diate in the ultraviolet and visible. However, the optical
and UV continuum data disfavor an accretion disk. While
Strader et al. (2015) measured a V0 magnitude (corrected for
extinction) spanning 15.64–15.91, PSR J1417- 4402 is much
fainter in u and especially in the UV ﬁlters (Table 3). Cor-
recting the Swift u magnitudes for an extinction Au = 0.50
(Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011), we ﬁnd u0 = 17.35 and 17.72
at φb = 0.95 and 0.33, respectively. Then 1.7 ≤ u0 - V0 ≤ 1.9,
which is in the correct range for giant stars of spectral type
G8–K0, which have 1.5 ≤ U0 - V0 ≤ 1.9 (Pickles 1998). This
is the type inferred by Strader et al. (2015) from the optical
spectrum of the companion. Thus, there is no evidence for
extra light in the ultraviolet coming from an accretion disk.
Also, the ultraviolet ﬂux detections, being higher at φb = 0.95
than at φb = 0.33, and faintest at φb = 0.82, are consistent in
magnitude and phase with the observed modulation due to el-
lipsoidal variations that dominate the optical light curves in
Strader et al. (2015).

However, since the companion star is likely a giant or sub-
giant (see below), it is brighter than the redback compan-
ions and could mask an accretion-disk component. We can
estimate an upper limit on a mass-transfer rate under the
conservative assumption that < 50% of the minimum ob-
served u-band ﬂux is contributed by a standard blackbody disk
(Frank et al. 2002) that is truncated at the pulsar corotation ra-
dius, rco = 36 km for a 2 M⊙ neutron star. For an inclination
angle of 58◦ (see Section 3.3) and a distance of 1.6 kpc, the
limit is ˙m < 4 × 1014 g s- 1. The u-band luminosity of a disk
is barely changed even if it is truncated at the light cylinder
radius, rlc = 127 km for PSR J1417- 4402.
This can be compared with ˙m ≈ 1 × 1015 g s- 1 estimated by
Papitto & Torres (2015) for the demonstrably accreting transi-
tional objects PSR J1023+0038 and XSS J12270- 4859 using
similar assumptions. And if the distance to PSR J1417- 4402
is actually 4.4 kpc, then it could have a similar accretion rate
as the transitional pulsars. Note that, in all of these cases, a
disk with such a low accretion rate cannot actually reach the
corotation radius, and most of the matter is propelled away
(Papitto & Torres 2015). This leaves the possibility that the
Hα could be emitted either from the outer disk or in a wind.
The current properties of PSR J1417- 4402 appear to be
most reminiscent of the eclipsing radio MSP J1740- 5340
in the globular cluster NGC 6397 (D’Amico et al. 2001),
which is bound to a “red straggler”/sub-subgiant companion
in a 1.3 day orbit. However this system was likely formed
in an exchange interaction in the dense cluster environment
(Orosz & van Kerkwijk 2003), with an evolutionary path sub-
stantially different from that of PSR J1417- 4402. The bolo-
metric luminosity of the PSR J1417- 4402 companion, deter-
mined by Strader et al. (2015) for a distance of 4.4 kpc, is
reduced by a factor of 7.6 at the DM-derived 1.6 kpc, mak-

5
ing it comparable to that of subgiants. PSR J1740- 5340 ex-
hibits radio eclipses around superior conjunction for 40% of
the orbit, as well as random DM variations at all phases. Its
X-ray spectrum is non-thermal (with Γ = 1.7) and possibly
modulated at the binary period (Bogdanov et al. 2010), sug-
gestive of an intra-binary shock. Perhaps most importantly,
PSR J1740- 5340 also exhibits a prominent Hα emission line
with complex morphology and strong orbital phase depen-
dence (Sabbi et al. 2003), which can be interpreted as being
produced in part by a wind from the secondary star that is
driven out of the binary by the pulsar wind. The clear ev-
idence for an active rotation-powered radio pulsar suggests
that PSR J1417- 4402 is presently in the so-called “radio ejec-
tion” regime (Ruderman et al. 1989; Burderi et al. 2002) in
which any Roche lobe overﬂow through the L1 point can-
not overcome the barrier imposed by the pulsar wind pres-
sure. A larger orbit actually favors this scenario according to
Burderi et al. (2002).

One might also consider the possibility that the system tran-
sitions rapidly between accreting and non-accreting states.
But Hα emission, as evidence for accretion, was detected
by Strader et al. (2015) in more than one dozen observations
spanning 1 yr through 2015 February, while the ﬁrst detection
of radio pulsations, ruling out accretion onto the neutron star,
occurred only one month later (Section 2.1). Given all the
available evidence, we favor an interpretation in which the
PSR J1417- 4402 system was not accreting at the time of the
optical and radio observations.

3.3. Component Masses

If the mass ratio and the inclination angle of the system
can be determined with precision, then the mass of the neu-
tron star can also be measured. This is of particular inter-
est because Strader et al. (2015) concluded that the neutron
star is massive, M1 = 1.97 ± 0.15 M⊙. Assuming a tidally
locked, Roche-lobe ﬁlling secondary, they obtained a mass ra-
tio q ≡ M2/M1 = 0.18 ± 0.01 from a measurement of the pro-
jected rotational velocity of the secondary (which has unspec-
iﬁed systematic uncertainties) and its radial velocity semi-
amplitude K2 = 115.7 ± 1.1 km s- 1. They also assumed a
Roche-lobe ﬁlling star to ﬁt the optical light curves for the
orbital inclination angle using an ellipsoidal model, ﬁnding
i = 58◦ ± 2◦.

Using the pulsar projected semi-major axis x1 (Table 2)
we infer that the pulsar radial velocity semi-amplitude is
19.8 km s- 1. Along with K2 this implies q = 0.171 ± 0.002,
limited by the precision on K2. Figure 3 shows the masses of
the neutron star and companion as a function of inclination an-
gle, allowing for the uncertainties on K2 and x1. For 56◦ ≤ i ≤
60◦, M1 ranges over 1.77–2.13 M⊙, and M2 = 0.33 ±0.03 M⊙.
However, if located at the smaller DM-based distance, the
radius of the companion is only 0.36 times the Roche-lobe
radius; its tidal distortion is reduced, and a larger i would
be necessary to ﬁt the ellipsoidal modulation, resulting in
smaller masses. The minimum allowed masses (for i = 90◦)
are M2 ≥ 0.20 M⊙ and M1 ≥ 1.15 M⊙. The Roche lobe ra-
dius decreases only slightly, from 4.1 R⊙ at i = 58◦ to 3.5 R⊙
at i = 90◦ according to the formula of Eggleton (1983), so a
higher inclination at the smaller distance would not allow the
companion to contact the Roche lobe.

3.4. No Photospheric Heating

The optical light curves (Strader et al. 2015), dominated
as they are by ellipsoidal modulation, show no evidence

3.5. Evolutionary Track

With a binary period of 5.4 days, PSR J1417- 4402 is on the
evolutionary track of low-to-intermediate mass companions
that started mass transfer onto a neutron star after they left the
main sequence (Podsiadlowski et al. 2002), and have increas-
ing periods. This distinguishes them from the black widows,
redbacks, and other low-mass X-ray binaries that have binary
periods ≤ 1 day, began mass transfer on the main sequence,
and evolve toward shorter periods. For 1 M⊙ secondaries,
these classes are separated by a bifurcation period of ≈ 18 hr
at the onset of mass transfer.
With M2 ≈ 0.3 M⊙, the companion of PSR J1417- 4402
must have already lost most of its initial mass, only a frac-
tion of which, accreting onto the neutron star, is sufﬁcient to
spin it up to 2.66 ms. In the models of Podsiadlowski et al.
(2002), PSR J1417- 4402 is not far from the ends of the
tracks that terminate when the binary period is in the range
6–20 days, and the companion is a He white dwarf of 0.2–
0.3 M⊙. The neutron stars in these calculations, assumed to
begin with 1.4 M⊙, end in the range 1.8–2.2 M⊙. Exactly how
far PSR J1417- 4402 is along this evolution is difﬁcult to de-
termine, since its companion may or may not be ﬁlling its
Roche lobe, may or may not be ﬁnished accreting onto the
neutron star, and may be losing mass mostly through ablation
by the pulsar wind, a process that is difﬁcult to model.

4. CONCLUSIONS

We have discovered a 2.66 ms pulsar in orbit around the
5.4 day optical variable discovered by Strader et al. (2015)
in the error ellipse of the high-energy gamma-ray source
3FGL J1417.5- 4402. The orbital dynamics require that the
companion mass is > 0.2 M⊙. The presence of radio pulsa-
tions suggests that the neutron star is not currently accreting
(see Section 3.2). The pulsar is only detected a fraction of the
time it is observed (although few observations exist at orbital
phases 0.65 < φb < 0.9; Figure 2), and is likely eclipsed for
more than half the orbit by outﬂowing material from the com-
panion; this has so far prevented us from obtaining a phase-
connected timing solution.

The DM distance of 1.6 kpc is in conﬂict with the origi-
nal estimate of d = 4.4 kpc, which was based on the assump-
tion that the companion ﬁlls its Roche lobe. This ambiguity
then affects most of the remaining interpretation, including
the precise evolutionary state of the system, whether it cur-
rently has an accretion disk, and the masses, which depend
on the modeled inclination angle. The current estimate of
1.77 ≤ M1 ≤ 2.13 M⊙ should really be regarded as an upper
limit. There are several claims of massive neutron stars in red-
backs and black widows. Modeling these systems, however,
is difﬁcult, especially in the presence of signiﬁcant heating
of the secondary by the pulsar (see, e.g., Romani et al. 2015).
So far there is no evidence for heating in the PSR J1417- 4402
system, which makes it a good candidate for a precise mass
measurement. Further optical observations and modeling of
ellipsoidal variations may better determine the inclination an-
gle, and thus the value of M1, whose uncertainty is currently
dominated by the systematic uncertainty on i.
The gamma-ray luminosity of 3FGL J1417.5- 4402 is Lγ =
3.7 × 1033 (d/1.6 kpc)2 erg s- 1 (see Acero et al. 2015), for
isotropic emission. At the DM-derived distance this could
be accounted for by magnetospheric emission from an MSP
with a typical spin-down luminosity ˙E ∼ 10 Lγ. At the larger
distance favored by Strader et al. (2015), PSR J1417- 4402

for heating of the companion’s photosphere by the pulsar
wind. This is probably because the intrinsic luminosity of
the giant/subgiant dominates. We can place an upper limit
on the spin-down luminosity ˙E of the pulsar, or more pre-
cisely, on the product of ˙E and an efﬁciency factor η that
includes the physics of reprocessing and any anisotropy of
the pulsar wind. A heating effect can be approximated using
η ˙ER2
eff), where Teff is the intrinsic tem-
perature of the unheated star, Th is the average temperature of
the side facing the pulsar, R2 is the radius of the companion,
and a is the orbital separation.

2/4a2 = 2πR2

We use Teff = 5000 K from the optical spectrum of
Strader et al. (2015), and assume an upper limit of 5200 K for
Th based on the absence of a heating signature at the level
of 0.1–0.2 magnitudes. For i = 58◦, the orbital separation is
a = 17 R⊙, and the limit on η ˙E is 2.1 × 1035 erg s- 1. If instead
we assume as a maximum i = 72◦ (for which M1 = 1.4 M⊙),
then a = 15.2 R⊙ and η ˙E < 1.7 × 1035 erg s- 1. Neither of these
limits are very restrictive, as η is likely to be less than unity.
These limits can also accommodate the gamma-ray luminos-
ity of 3FGL J1417.5- 4402, 3 × 1034 erg s- 1 at a distance of
4.4 kpc (see Section 4).

would be among the three most
luminous MSPs (see
Abdo et al. 2013), and might require substantial gamma-ray
emission from an intra-binary shock, or a higher than average
spin-down luminosity.
A phase-connected timing solution for PSR J1417- 4402
will yield its ˙E and will allow a search for gamma-ray pul-
sations. The spin-down luminosity is a fundamental quan-
tity that limits the X-ray and gamma-ray luminosities, and the
possible rate of ablation of the companion and of the inner ac-
cretion disk if any exists. In addition, a phase-connected so-
lution will place useful constraints on the orbital eccentricity.
These quantities should lead to an improved understanding of
this unusual system. Finally, the great difﬁculty we have in
detecting the radio pulsar is a reminder that there could be a
substantial population of such long-period systems awaiting
discovery, which would represent the late phases, until now
unobserved, in the formation of typical MSP binaries.
