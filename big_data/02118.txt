Growth of balls of holomorphic sections on

projective toric varieties

Mounir Hajli ∗

Abstract

Let O(D) be an equivariant line bundle which is big and nef on a complex projective nonsingular
toric variety X. Given a continuous toric metric k · k on O(D), we deﬁne the energy at equilibrium
of (X, φD) where φD is the weight of the metrized toric divisor D = (D, k · k). We show that this
energy describes the asymptotic behaviour as k → ∞ of the volume of the L2-norm unit ball induced
by (X, kφD) on the space of global holomorphic sections H 0(X, O(kD)).

Key Words: Toric varieties, Equilibrium weight, Energy functional, Berstein-Markov property, Monge-Ampère

1 Introduction

Let Q be a free Z-module of rank n and P its dual. We consider a fan Σ on QR = Q ⊗Z R and we denote
by X = XΣ the associated toric variety over C, see for instance [8]. In the sequel, we assume that X is
nonsingular and projective (this is equivalent to the fact that Σ is nonsingular and the support of Σ is
QR, see [8, theorems 1.10, 1.11]). We set TQ := HomZ(P, C∗) ≃ (C∗)n and we denote by SQ ≃ (S1)n its
compact torus. We have an open dense immersion TQ ֒→ X with an action of TQ on X which extends
the action of TQ on its self by translations.

The toric varieties have a rich geometry that can be related to the geometry of polytopes. Many
results in algebraic geometry and complex diﬀerential geometry can be tested on them, for instance the
Riemann-Roch formula.

On toric varieties, some properties of line bundles can be interpreted in terms of convex geometry.
Let D be an equivariant Cartier divisor on X also called a toric divisor, that is a Cartier divisor which
is invariant under the action of the torus TQ. Let sD be the rational section of O(D) associated to
D. We know that D deﬁnes a Σ-linear support function ΨD on Σ (see [8, Deﬁnition p. 66]) and D
is uniquely deﬁned by this function (see [8, Proposition 2.1 (v)]). Moreover the function ΨD deﬁnes a
convex polytope:

∆D := {x ∈ PR| < x, u >≥ ΨD(u), ∀ u ∈ QR},

where PR := P ⊗Z R. ∆D and ψD encode many geometric informations about D, for instance

1. H 0(X, O(D)) = ⊕e∈∆D∩P Cχe, where χe denotes the character associated to e, see [8, Lemma 2.3].

2. vol(O(D)) = n!vol(∆D), (this follows from (1.)).

3. D is nef if and only if ΨD is concave (see [8, Theorem 2.7]).

4. If D is nef then degD(X) = n!vol(∆D).

5. D is big if and only if dim(∆D) = n, by (2.).

6. D is ample if and only if ΨD is strictly concave (see [8, Theorem 2.13]).

If we denote by X≥ the quotient of X by SQ. Then the open subset X ◦

≥ can be identiﬁed with
HomZ(P, R>0) (see [6, §4]). But, since QR = HomZ(P, R) then the usual exponential deﬁnes a morphism
exp(−(·)) : QR → X ◦

≥ ֒→ X(C). This morphism extends in a obvious way to QC → TQ ֒→ X(C).

We say that a function f on X (resp. a hermitian metric k·k on O(D)) is SQ-invariant if f (z ·x) = f (x)
(resp. ksDk(z · x) = ksDk(x)) for any x ∈ X and z ∈ SQ. A continuous hermitian metric k · k on O(D)
is said semipositive if the Chern current c1(O(D), k · k) is nonnegative. An admissible metric is by
deﬁnition a uniform limit of a sequence of smooth hermitian semipositive metrics. When O(D) is am-
ple then the notions of admissible metrics and semipositives metrics are equivalent, see [7, Theorem 4.6.1].

The function ΨD deﬁnes a continuous hermitian metric on O(D) called the canonical metric of O(D).
It is given locally as follows: The norm of a local holomorphic section s at a point x is the following real

ks(x)k∞,D = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

s

χΨD

.

(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(see [7, Proposition 3.3.1]). When O(D) is spanned by its global sections (equivalently ΨD is concave)
one can show that k · kD,∞ = φ∗
Dk · k∞ where φD : X → P#(∆D∩P )−1 is the equivariant morphism deﬁned
in terms of ∆D ∩ P and k · k∞ is the canonical metric of O(1) (see [7, §3.3.3] for a detailed construction).
Moreover we have that k · k∞,D is a uniform limit of a sequence of smooth semipositive metrics and
− log ksDk2

∞,D is a plurisubharmonic weight on O(D) [7, Propositions 3.3.11, 3.3.12].

Let k · kD be a SQ-invariant hermitian metric on O(D) such that k · kD/k · k∞,D is bounded on X.
We let D := (D, k · kD) the obtained hermitian line bundle and we called it a toric metrized divisor. We
set gD : QR → R the function deﬁned as follows:

By deﬁnition of the canonical metric one can check easily that

gD(u) := log ksD(exp(−u))kD ∀u ∈ QR.

gD∞

(u) = inf{< v, u > | v ∈ ∆D} ∀ u ∈ QR.

(1)

(< v, u > denotes the pairing deﬁned by QR and PR). We denote by ˇgD : PR → [−∞, +∞[ the Legendre-
Fenchel transform of gD, i.e the function deﬁned for any x ∈ PR as follows

ˇgD(x) := inf
x∈QR

(< x, u > −gD(u)).

We have ˇgD∞
following assertion: ˇgD∞
(x) for any x ∈ ∆D and t > 0, which is an easy consequence of (1)).
Combining this with Proposition 2.3, we can show that ˇgD(x) is ﬁnite if and only if x ∈ ∆D and ˇgD is
concave on ∆D.

(x) = tˇgD∞

By the theory of Bedford-Taylor [1], this deﬁnition extends to admissible metrics, and hence to inte-
grable ones by polarisation. By deﬁnition an integrable metric can be written, in additive notation, as a
diﬀerence of two admissible metrics.

Following [2], when O(D) is big we set

Eeq(D1) − Eeq(D0) :=

1

Vol(D)

(E((D1)X ) − E((D0)X ).

where (Di)X is the metrized toric divisor D endowed with the weight PX φDi
φDi

, the equilibrium weight of
for i = 0, 1. In [2, §1.3], Eeq(D) is called the energy at equilibrium of (X, φD) (φD is the weight of D).

Our ﬁrst result is Theorem 3.4 which gives an integral representation of the variation of the energy
functional E in terms of some combinatorial objects deﬁned on the polytope associated to D. This theo-
rem can be seen as a toric version of [2, Theorem B].

Let µ be a probability measure with non-pluripolar support on X. We endow the space of global

sections H 0(X, O(D)) with the L2-norm

ksk2

L2(µ,D) := ZX

ksk2

Dµ.

Also we consider the sup norm deﬁned as follows

ksksup,D := sup

for any s ∈ H 0(X, O(D)). Let k ∈ N∗. We consider the following functional

Lk(µ, kD) :=

1

2kNk

log volkB2(µ, kD),

where volkB2(µ, kD) is by deﬁnition the volume of the unit ball B2(µ, kD) in H 0(X, O(kD)) with respect
to the L2-norm, and Nk := dim H 0(X, O(kD)).

The Bergman distortion function ρ(µ, D) is by deﬁnition the function given at a point x ∈ X by

ρ(µ, D)(x) =

If {s1, . . . , sN } is a L2(µ, D)-orthonormal basis of H 0(X, O(D), then it is well known that

ρ(µ, D)(x) =

have

2 = O(ekε).

If µ is a smooth positive volume form and k · kD is a continuous metric on O(D) then µ has the

Bernstein-Markov property with respect to k · kD (see [2, Lemma 3.2]).

Our main result is the following theorem:

Theorem 1.2. [Main theorem] Let X be a complex projective nonsingular toric variety and D a toric
) be a continuous toric metrized
divisor on X such that O(D) is big and nef. Let Di := (D, k · kDi
divisor on X for i = 0, 1. Let µj be a probability measure which is SQ-invariant on X and with the
Bernstein-Markov property with respect to k · kDj

, j = 0, 1. Then as k → ∞ we have

Lk(µ1, D1) − Lk(µ0, D0) → Eeq(D1) − Eeq(D0).

This theorem describes the asymptotics of Lk(µ, D), the functional volume of the balls of the holo-
morphic sections of a continuous toric divisor D when k tends to ∞. In particular we recover partially a
result of Berman and Boucksom [2, Theorem A]. Comparing to [2] our approach is completely diﬀerent.
In fact, our strategy is based mainly on the combinatorial structure of the toric variety, which makes the
proof much easier. A crucial ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is Theorem 3.4.

2 The Monge-Ampère operator and the equilibrium weight

We keep the same notations as in the introduction. Let X be a complex projective nonsingular toric
variety and and L a holomorphic line bundle over X. Let φ be a weight of a continuous hermitian metric
e−φ on L. When φ is smooth we deﬁne the Monge-Ampère operator as

The equilibrium weight of φ is deﬁned as:

MA(φ) := (ddcφ)∧n.

PX φ := sup{ψ| ψ psh weight on L, ψ ≤ φ on X}.

It is known that the equilibrium weight is upper semicontinuous psh weight with minimal singularities.

Proposition 2.1. Let φ1 and φ0 be two continuous weights on L a big line bundle on X. We have

|PX φ1 − PX φ0| ≤ sup
x∈X

|φ1 − φ0|.

Proof. This an easy consequence of the deﬁnition of the equilibrium weight.

Assume that L is ample and let ω be a positive (1, 1)-form in c1(L). We set

Hω := {u ∈ C∞(X)| ddcu + ω > 0}.

Clearly, Hω is convex subset which is identiﬁed with the set of smooth positive hermitian metrics (resp.
weights) on L. We set Pω(u) := sup{v ∈ Hω|v ≤ u}. Following [2], [3], this operator extends to C0(X)
with image in C0(X) ∩ Hω. In other words, if φ is continuous weight on L an ample line bundle then
PX φ is also continuous.

4

Remark 2.2. Let D be a toric nef divisor on X. Let k · kD (resp. φD) a continuous hermitian metric
/k · k∞,D (resp. PX φD − φ∞,D) is bounded on X, where
(resp. continuous weight) on D. Then k · kDX
DX is hermitian line bundle O(D) endowed with the metric deﬁned by PX φD. Indeed, since D is nef
then k · k∞,D is a semipositive metric. Then we can ﬁnd a constant C such that φ∞,D − C ≤ PX φ ≤ φD.

Proposition 2.3. Let g be a real function on QR. Then g deﬁnes a hermitian (continuous) metric k · kg
on O(D) if and only if g − ΨD extends to a bounded (continuous) function on X≥. Moreover, we have

sup
x∈∆D

|ˇg − ˇg′| ≤ sup
u∈QR

|g − g′|,

for any g and g′ two functions on QR deﬁning hermitian metrics on O(D).

Proof. The proof is an easy consequence of the deﬁnitions.

Lemma 2.4. Let D = (D, k · kD) be a continuous metrized divisor such that O(D) is big and nef on
X. We set φD := − log ksDkD and we denote by DX the metrized toric divisor D endowed with PX φD.
Then PX φD is a SQ-invariant weight on D and the following equality holds on ∆D

ˇgD = ˇgDX

.

Proof. By deﬁnition φD is SQ-invariant weight. Let ψ be a psh weight on O(D) such that ψ ≤ φ. For
any t ∈ SQ, we set ψt := ψ(t · (·)). Then ψt is a psh weight verifying ψt(z) ≤ φD(t · z) = φD(z) for any
z ∈ X. That is ψt ≤ φD. We conclude that (PX φD)t ≤ PX φD for any t ∈ SQ. It follows that PX φD is a
SQ-invariant weight on D. By (2.2), ˇgDX
for
any k ∈ N and s ∈ H 0(X, O(kD)) (see for instance [2, Proposition 2.8]). Let k ∈ N∗ and e ∈ k∆D ∩P . We
have kχeksup,kD = supx∈X kχe(x)kkD = supu∈QR kχe(exp(−u))kkD = exp(−k inf u∈QR ( e
k · u − gD(u)) =
exp(−kˇgD( e

is well deﬁned. Moreover, we have ksksup,kD = ksksup,kDX

k )). We deduce that

ˇgD(x) = ˇgDX

(x) ∀ x ∈ ∆D ∩ Qn.

Using the fact that a concave and ﬁnite function on a ∆D is necessarily continuous on its interior, see [9,
Theorem 10.1], then we get ˇgD = ˇgDX
on Int(∆D). But, since ∆D is the convex closure of ∆D ∩ P then

ˇgD(x) = ˇgDX

(x) ∀ x ∈ ∆D.

3 The energy functional in the toric setting

The goal of this section is to give a formula for the variation of the energy functional E in terms of the
Legendre-Fenchel transform. First, this formula is proved in the ample case, see Theorem 3.4, then we
deduce the general case of big and nef divisors in Corollary 3.6.

Proposition 3.1. Let D be a toric divisor on X. Assume that there exists k · k an admissible and
SQ-invariant metric on O(D). Then there exists a sequence of smooth, semipositive and SQ-invariant
hermitian metrics converging uniformly to k · k.

Proof. First let recall that given a smooth hermitian metric k · k one can average it in order to get
a SQ-invariant smooth metric. This is done as follows, we deﬁne the metric k · kSQ given on TQ
log ks(t · x)kdµHaar. This metric extends to X since log(ks(x)kSQ/ks(x)k′) =
log(ks(t · x)k/ks(x)k′)dµHaar where k · k′ is a smooth and SQ-invariant metric, extends to a smooth

by log ks(x)kSQ = RSQ

function to X. Clearly the metric k · kSQ is SQ-invariant and smooth. Moreover c1(O(D), k · kSQ) =
t∗c1(O(D), k · k)dµHaar where t∗ is the pull-back deﬁned by the multiplication by t. It follows that if

RSQ

c1(O(D), k · k) ≥ 0 then c1(O(D), k · kSQ) ≥ 0.

Let k ·k be an admissible hermitian metric. By deﬁnition there exists (k ·kn)n∈N a sequence of smooth,
semipositive hermitian metrics converging uniformly to k · k. By averaging this sequence as before we
get a sequence of smooth, semipositive and SQ-invariant hermitian metrics which converges uniformly to
k · k.

Suppose now that k · k0 and k · k1 are admissible. By deﬁnition, there exists (k · ki,n)n∈N a sequence of
smooth and semipositive metrics on L converging uniformly to k · ki, i = 1, 2. By Proposition 3.1, we can
assume that the metrics of the sequences are SQ-invariant. Moreover, we can also suppose that k · ki,n
is positive for all n ∈ N and i = 0, 1. Indeed, let k · k′ be a smooth, positive and SQ-invariant metric on
O(D) (for example one can take the pull-back of the Fubini-Study by an equivariant morphism deﬁned
by D) then k · k1−1/n
k · k′1/n is positive, smooth and SQ-invariant. We have (3) holds for gi = gn,i for
any n ∈ N and i = 0, 1. By the theory of Beford-Taylor the LHS converges to E(D1) − E(D0). By (2.3)

Then ˇgA(0) is ﬁnite and it follows that gA is bounded from above. If we multiply the metric of A by a
positive constant, then it is possible to assume that gA ≤ 0. Observe that the assertion of the proposition

endowed with the weight PX φDi
Proposition 4.1. We have,

(5)

Proof. For any e ∈ ∆D ∩ P , we set se := kχek−1
χe (χe is the global section of O(D) deﬁned by e.
Recall that H 0(X, O(D)) = ⊕m∈∆D∩P Cχm). Since µ0 and µ1 are SQ-invariant, then {se| e ∈ ∆D ∩ P }
is an L2(µ1, D1)-orthonormal basis of H 0(X, L) and we have

L2(µ1,D1)

volL2(µ1,D1)(B(µ1, D1))
volL2(µ0,D0)(B(µ0, D0))

= det(cid:0)(se, se′ )L2(µ0,D0)(cid:1)e,e′∈∆D∩P = Ye∈∆D∩P

(se, se)L2(µ0,D0).

Then for any k ∈ N∗,

(Nk := dim H 0(X, O(kD))). Since (µ0, D0) and (µ1, D1) satisfy the Bernstein-Markov property, then for

Suppose that D is ample. We know that k ·kDiX
By [7, Theorem 4.6.1], this metric is admissible. Using Corollary 3.6, we deduce that

Thus,

E(D1X ) − E(D0X ) = −Z∆D

(ˇgD1 X

(x))dx.

E(D1X ) − E(D0X ) = −Z∆D

by lemma 2.4. Now by Proposition 4.1 we get

lim
k→∞

Lk(µ1, D1) − Lk(µ0, D0) =

1

vol(D)(cid:0)E(D1X ) − E(D0X )(cid:1) = Eeq(D1) − Eeq(D0).

Thus we proved Theorem 1.2 for ample divisors.

4.2 The case of big and nef divisor

Let D a metrized toric divisor such that D is big and nef. Let A be a positive metrized toric divisor on
X. Let l > 0 and we set φl := PX (φD + 1
l φA where φD (resp. φA) denotes the associated weight
to D (resp. A). We have φl deﬁnes a continuous metric on D. Indeed, this is follows from the fact that
lD + A is ample for any l ∈ N (because D is nef and A is ample), which implies that PX (lφD + φA) is a
′
l the continuous metrized toric divisor D endowed with
continuous weight on lD + A. We denote by D
the continuous weight φl.

l φA) − 1

Lemma 4.2. (φl)l∈N∗ is a decreasing sequence of continuous weights on O(D) converging pointwise to
PX φ.
Proof. First notice that the limit of the sequence (φl)l∈N∗ , if it exists, doesn’t depend on the choice of
the metric on A. Indeed, let φ1,A and φ0,A be two weights on A deﬁning continuous metrics and we set
φi,l := PX (φD + 1

l φi,A for i = 0, 1. Then by Proposition 2.1 we have

l φi,A) − 1

|φ1,l − φ0,l| ≤

|φ1,A − φ0,A|,

∀l ∈ N∗.

Suppose that φA is psh. Let ψ be a psh weight on D with ψ ≤ φD then ψ + 1
satisfying ψ + 1
D such that ψ ≤ φD. Thus

l φA). Therefore, ψ ≤ PX (φD + 1

l φA ≤ PX (φA + 1

l φA is also a psh weight

k φA). So

If we set Ψ := liml∈N∗,l7→∞ φl, then

PX φ ≤ Ψ ≤ φl+1 ≤ φl ≤ φD ∀l ∈ N∗.

(6)

Let k ∈ N∗, we have φl + 1
(see for instance [5, Theorem 5.4]). It follows that Ψ is psh weight on D. We conclude that

k φA is psh for any l ≥ k. Then Ψ + 1

k φA is also a psh function for any k ∈ N∗

PX φD = Ψ.

12

Recall that φl is continuous for any l ∈ N∗. We have (φl + 1
