Abstract

Intense and puriﬁed radioactive beam of post-accelerated 14O was used to study the low-lying states in the
unbound 15F nucleus. Exploiting resonant elastic scattering in inverse kinematics with a thick target, the
second excited state, a resonance at ER=4.757(6)(10) MeV with a width of Γ=36(5)(14) keV was measured
for the ﬁrst time with high precision. The structure of this narrow above-barrier state in a nucleus located
two neutrons beyond the proton drip line was investigated using the Gamow Shell Model in the coupled
channel representation with a 12C core and three valence protons. It is found that it is an almost pure wave
function of two quasi-bound protons in the 2s1/2 shell.

1. Introduction

The boundaries for nuclear stability against par-
ticle emission are called ”drip lines”. Beyond the
drip lines the particle emission time τ is usually
shorter than 10−21 seconds and unbound nuclei are
observed as broad resonances. The proton drip line
plays an important role in nuclear astrophysics, e.g.
in the Main Sequence and Red Giant stars, during
the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (2He, 4Li, 5Li, 8Be
are unbound) and in the rp-process [1] during type I
X-ray bursts where rapid proton captures reactions
reaching the proton drip line (from 15F up to 101Sb)
should wait for β decays before proceeding further.
However, formation of narrow resonances at high
excitation energies and beyond drip mines is not an

unexpected phenomenon.
If the spacing between
the resonances becomes smaller than their widths,
the salient reordering processes under the inﬂuence
of the environment of continuum states takes place.
This phenomenon which is related to the avoided
crossing in the complex energy plane has been ref-
ereed to as resonance trapping [2, 3] and proved ex-
perimentally on an open microwave billiard [4]. In
atomic nuclei, direct studies of resonance trapping
are not feasible because one cannot trace widths of
states as a function of the coupling strength to con-
tinuum. However, much information have been ac-
cumulated indirectly which contradict the naive ex-
pectation based on the random matrix theory that
all nuclear levels will be broadened with increasing

coupling strength to the continuum [5].

1 and 4+

Narrow resonances are also known at low excita-
tion energies in the domain of isolated resonances.
Particularly interesting are those which appear due
to either the avoided crossing of resonances, or the
near-threshold collectivization in the ensemble of
shell model (SM) states which yields the collective
state which carries many features of the nearby
particle emission threshold. A well known exam-
ple is the unbound nucleus 8Be which decays in
the ground state by 2α particles. The proximity
of 2α-decay threshold enhances the 2α correlations
in the ground state 0+
1 wave function and imprints
the nature of 2+
1 broad resonances [6, 7].
Interestingly, at higher excitation energies in the
vicinity of one-proton (1p) and one-neutron (1n)
decay thresholds, one ﬁnds a group of narrow reso-
nances (2+
2 ) which
carry the imprint of nearby decay channels [7Li-
p] and [7Be-n] and hence, the 2α component in
these resonances is suppressed. As a result, one
observes a strong reduction of the decay width for
these states as compared to the width of 2+
1 and
4+
1 resonances. The coupling to these channels is
also at the origin of width attraction (Γi1 ≃ Γi2 )
in (2+
2 ) doublets of resonances,
and the width repulsion (Γi1 << Γi2 ) in (1+

resonances [8]. Width attraction and width repul-
sion are two generic features of the avoided crossing
of resonances in open quantum systems [5].

It is interesting to compare these results for
8Be with others open quantum systems to sepa-
rate generic aspects of the continuum coupling from
speciﬁc aspects which are related to the nuclear in-
teraction, such as the ordering and the excitation
energy of the particle emission thresholds. In this
work, we study the spectroscopy of 15F, the isotope
of ﬂuorine located two neutrons beyond the proton
drip line. The reordering processes induced by the
continuum couplings in this nucleus are governed by
diﬀerent sets of channels than in 8Be. The present
work reports on the observation of a narrow state
in the vicinity of the 2p emission threshold using
the resonant elastic scattering reaction 14O(p,p)14O
measured in inverse kinematics. The structure of
this state was also investigated using the Gamow
Shell Model in the coupled channel representation
with a 12C core plus three valence protons.

Properties of the ground state (Jπ = 1/2+

1 ) and
the ﬁrst excited state (Jπ = 5/2+
1 ) of 15F were
measured several times [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
see Ref.[16] for a compilation of the results. The
ground state is unbound by ≈ 1.3 MeV and is ob-
served as a broad resonance with Γ ≈ 0.5-1.3 MeV
[16, 17, 18]. The ﬁrst excited state is unbound by
≈ 2.8 MeV and is observed as a narrower resonance
of Γ ≈ 300 keV. Both states are well described as
single-particle conﬁgurations with dimensionless re-
duced width, sometimes called spectroscopic factor,
θ2 > 0.5 [16, 19, 20]. The structure of the ground
(ﬁrst excited) state is interpreted as mainly a pro-
ton orbiting with ℓ = 0 (ℓ = 2) around a 14Ogs core
[19].

Candidate for the second excited state can be
looked at in the mirror nucleus. The second ex-
cited state in the mirror nucleus 15C is known at
the energy of 3103 keV, with Jπ = 1/2−
1 and a
width Γ = 29(3) keV [21]. This state was populated
strongly in two-neutron transfer reactions with a
13C target [22, 23], indicating a structure of mainly
two sd-shell neutrons coupled to a 13C core. Canton
et al. [24] used the multichannel algebraic scatter-
ing theory with Pauli-hindered method in order to
predict the properties of the low-lying states in 15F.
A very narrow width Γ=5 keV was predicted for
the second excited state, see Table 1. Fortune and
Sherr [25] used a potential model to determine the
single-particle widths which they scaled down to re-
produce the measured widths in 15C. The extracted
θ2 were used to calculate widths in the mirror nu-
cleus 15F. These calculations conﬁrmed that narrow
resonances are to be expected in 14O+p, but they
obtained a width 10 times larger than the one of
Ref. [24] for the second excited state. Reﬁned val-
ues were later published by Fortune [21], see Table
1. Canton et al. [26] objected that θ2 do not neces-
sary scale with the single-particle widths, especially
when the θ2 is small [27].

A ﬁrst indication for the observation of the sec-
ond excited state in 15F was obtained at GANIL
by Lepine-Szily et al.
[13] through the measure-
ment of the transfer reaction 16O(14N,15C(0.740
MeV)∗)15F. A narrow peak of ≈10 counts with a
width of only 150(100) keV was observed. This
state was also observed through the angular cor-
relations of decay products in the fragmentation of
17Ne [28], with slightly more statistics (≈20 counts)
but a worse resolution. Results of these measure-

ments are summarized in Table 1. The narrow
width is particularly surprising since this state is
located 3.5 MeV above the Coulomb plus centrifu-
gal barrier of the system 14O+p. The spin of this
second excited state has not been assigned.

3. Experiment

The 15F nucleus was studied using the resonant
elastic scattering technique. The excitation func-
tion of the elastic scattering reaction 14O(p,p)14O
was obtained in inverse kinematics using a thick
target. The excitation function at low energy is
dominated by Coulomb scattering, but it also shows
peaks and interferences that correspond to the pres-
ence of resonances in the compound nucleus. The
properties of these resonances, i.e.
resonance en-
ergy, width, and spin, can be extracted from the
analysis of the shape of the peaks using the R-
Matrix formalism [29, 30, 18]. More details on the
procedure can be found in Ref.
[31, 32, 33, 34].
The experiment was performed at the GANIL SPI-
RAL1 facility. Two beams were used: the radioac-
tive beam of 14O for the study of 15F, and a sta-
ble beam 14N for calibrations. Radioactive 14O3+
ions were produced through the fragmentation of
a 95 MeV/u 20Ne primary beam impinging on a
thick carbon production target. The ions were post-
accelerated with the CIME cyclotron up to the
energy of 5.95(1) MeV/u with an energy spread
<0.2%. The isobaric contamination of the beam
was reduced down to 0.0(1) % using a 0.9 µm thick
stripper aluminium foil located at the entrance of
the LISE zero degree achromatic spectrometer. The
14O8+ ions were selected using LISE and trans-
ported to the experimental setup located in the D4
experimental area. An average beam intensity of
1.88(1)x105 pps was achieved. This value was ob-

3

tained by regularly measuring the beam intensity
with a silicon detector in conjunction with a cali-
brated beam intensity reduction system, as well as
by counting the 2.312 MeV γ-ray emitted in the
β-decay of 14O using a high-purity germanium de-
tector.

The beam was sent to a thick target where it was
stopped. The target was made of three (four in
the case of 14N) polypropylene (CH2)n foils, 50 µm
thick each. The foils were ﬁxed side by side with
the last one put on a 250 rpm rotating system
called FULIS [35]. This system was used to re-
duce the background arising from the β-delayed
proton emission of 14O (t1/2=70.6 s). Counting rate
was reduced from 85 Hz with the stopped target to
≈1 Hz with the rotating target. The scattered pro-
tons were detected downstream in a ∆E(500 µm)-
E(6 mm cooled SiLi) telescope of silicon detectors
that covered an angular acceptance of ±2.2(2)◦.
Identiﬁcation of the protons was made using con-
tours on ∆E-E and time-of-ﬂight parameters.

The elastic scattering reaction 14N(p,p)14N was
measured under the same experimental conditions
to calibrate the detectors in energy. Energy cali-
bration and resolution were obtained by populat-
ing known resonances in the compound nucleus
15O [36, 37] using the same procedure as discussed
in Ref.
[15]. An experimental energy resolution,
σc.m. = 7(2) keV, was measured from the width
of the observed peaks and using an alpha source.
No change was measured as a function of the pro-
ton energy. The major contributions to this reso-
lution were from the ∆E-E detectors (4.2 keV and
3.0 keV) and the beam and proton straggling in the
target (4.7 keV).

Instead the results published in Ref.

The polypropylene target also contains carbon
atoms, which induced a background through reac-
tions with the beam. This carbon-induced proton
background was not measured in the present exper-
iment.
[15]
obtained in very similar experimental conditions
were used. This background was normalized ac-
cording to carbon content and beam intensity, and
subtracted to the measured proton spectrum. The
proton background was featureless, almost ﬂat with
a weak maximum of 0.09 barn/sr at 1.8 MeV (c.m.)
[15, 38].

at an energy ER = 1270(10)(10) keV with

certainties correspond to statistical and system-
atic uncertainties respectively. The resonance en-
ergy is in agreement with last published value
ER = 1230(50) keV [15]. The measured width is
lower than the values obtained in previous stud-
ies by at least 30%, but is still within the error
bars. This lower value is also supported by some
theoretical considerations [39, 40]. In Fig. 1, the
best ﬁt is shown with the continuous red line which
leads to Γ = 376 keV. For comparison, the dashed-
blue line shows the calculation made for the average
value of the previous results, i.e. Γ = 737 keV. Nei-
ther of the two calculations reproduce the data at

Ec.m. ≈ 3.4 MeV. The largest diﬀerences between
the two calculations are found at Ec.m. ≈ 2.2 MeV,
where the absolute cross section is most sensitive to
the carbon-induced background. Since the carbon-
induced background was not measured, a system-
atic error of ± 25 mbarn/sr on its cross section
was adopted for the full range of energy, which re-
sulted in a systematic error for the g.s. width of
(+200

) keV.

The peak observed at the resonance energy
ER = 2763(9)(10) keV with Γ = 305(9)(10) keV
corresponds to the Jπ = 5/2+
1 ﬁrst excited state.
It is in good agreement with the previous measure-
ments. The controversy about the width of this
state [16], resulting in θ2 exceeding unity, is due to
the very small single particle width Γs.p.=250 keV
calculated in Ref.
[10]. A more meaningful value
of θ2 = 0.42 is obtained using Γs.p. = 726 keV cal-
culated with a conventional formula [43]. It is pos-
sible to calculate a weighted average of all values
measured so far using the statistical procedure of
the Particle Data Group [41] assuming a Gaussian
distribution of the diﬀerent and independent mea-
surements [42]. We obtain the recommended values
ER = 2794(16) keV and Γ = 301(16) keV.

In addition, for the ﬁrst time in a resonant elas-
tic scattering experiment, the second excited state
is clearly observed (insert of Fig. 1) as a narrow dip
at a resonance energy of ≈ 4.8 MeV. In the corre-
sponding mirror nucleus, the second excited state
has spin Jπ = 1/2−
1 . The resonance has the shape
predicted by Canton et al.
[24], which is due to
destructive interferences between the Jπ = 1/2−
1
resonance and Coulomb scattering. No other spin
assignment can better reproduce the shape of the
structure. The other solutions also induce a peak
arising from constructive interferences that is not
observed.
It is the ﬁrst time the spin of this
state is assigned. The R-Matrix analysis of the
excitation function was performed taking into ac-
count the experimental resolution. The resonance
is measured to be ER = 4.757(6)(10) MeV with
Γ = 36(5)(14) keV. The measured properties are
in good agreement with the previous experimental
results, see Table 1. The present work shows a sig-
niﬁcant improvement in the resolution, at least by a
factor 5. All resonances predicted at higher energies
[24, 25] were taken into account in the R-Matrix ﬁt
of the excitation function, but their properties were
kept ﬁxed. Negative parity states are taken from
Ref.
[25] and the positive parity states from Ref.
[24]. A 500 keV uncertainty in the energy of these
higher lying resonances was taken into account in
the systematic uncertainties.

The observation of this narrow resonance in 15F
is surprising since this resonance is located well
above the Coulomb plus centrifugal barrier (BC +
Bℓ ≈ 3.3 MeV) for the proton emission, there is no
barrier to retain the proton inside the nucleus. The
single-particle width of this state is 1.6-3.0 MeV
[25] (depending on the model parameters), com-
pared to the measured value of 36(19) keV. This
implies that the measured lifetime is more than
40 times longer. As discussed before, the second
excited state is known in the mirror nucleus 15C
at an energy of 3103 keV. It is unbound with re-
spect to one neutron emission, and has a width of
29(3) keV [21]. Here too, the resonance is located
above the ℓ = 1 centrifugal barrier (Bℓ ≈ 1.2 MeV),
nevertheless it is still very narrow.

There are experimental evidences in the mirror
nucleus that this negative-parity state is a nearly
pure (sd)2 conﬁguration coupled to the ground
state of 13N [22, 23]. The emission of two protons
from the narrow state is energetically possible, as
seen in Fig. 2. Since there is no intermediate state
accessible to 14O, it should be a direct two-proton

emission to the g.s. of 13N. However, the available
energy is only Q2p = 129 keV, inducing a Wigner
limit of Γ2He = 4x10−11 eV (t1/2=16.5 µs) for the
emission of a 2He cluster with ℓ=0. Moreover, it is
known that the modeling of the decay by the tun-
neling of a 2He cluster overestimates the two-proton
width [46, 20]. Therefore, the branching ratio for
the emission of two protons is expected to be ex-
tremely small.

5. GSM Calculations

The description of 15F requires a proper treat-
ment of the continuum couplings. Here, we use
the Gamow shell model (GSM) which provides a
fully microscopic and uniﬁed description of bound
and unbound nuclear states [51, 52, 53], and nu-
clear reactions [55, 56].
In the latter case, GSM
is formulated in the coupled channel representation
(GSM-CC).

In our studies, the translationally invariant GSM
Hamiltonian consists of (i) the Woods-Saxon poten-
tial with the spin-orbit term which describes the
ﬁeld of the 12C core acting on valence nucleons
in 13N, 14O, and 15F, (ii) the Furutani-Horiuchi-
Tamagaki (FHT) ﬁnite-range two-body interaction
[57] between valence nucleons, and (iii) the recoil
term (for details see Ref.
[56]). Parameters of the
Hamiltonian are adjusted to reproduce the bind-
ing energies of low-lying states, and the one- and
two-proton separation energies in 15F. Due to the
absence of the three-body interaction, parameters

of the GSM Hamiltonian had to be slightly read-
justed in 14O because no set of parameters of this
eﬀective two-body interaction can reproduce simul-
taneously spectra and binding energies of 13N, 14O,
15F.

and L+

GSM-CC calculations are performed in three res-
onant shells: 0p1/2, 0d5/2 and 1s1/2, and several
shells in the non-resonant continuum along the dis-
cretized contours: L+
in the complex
momentum k plane. Each contour consists of three
segments joining the points: kmin=0.0, kpeak =
0.3 − i0.1 fm−1, kmiddle=0.6 fm−1 and kmax=2.0
fm−1 for L+
, and kmin=0.0, kpeak = 0.25 − i0.1
fm−1, kmiddle=0.5 fm−1 and kmax=2.0 fm−1 for
L+
. Each segment is discretized with 10 points.
The states along each contour are generated by the
same WS potential. The p1/2 continuum is approx-
imated by 5 lowest harmonic oscillator (HO) wave
functions. Similarly, the p3/2 and d3/2 continua are
approximated by 5 and 6 HO states, respectively.
To reduce the size of the GSM matrix, the basis of
Slater determinants is truncated by limiting to 2 the
number of nucleons in the non-resonant continuum
states.

Even if the spectroscopic factors are model de-
pendent, their values within a given theoretical
framework provide an useful insight into the struc-
ture of the wave functions. For 1/2+
1 state, the
largest one-proton spectroscopic factor is to the
ground state of 14O (S(1/2+)
Simi-
larly for 5/2+
1 state, the largest spectroscopic factor
(S(5/2+)
= 0.93) is also to the ground state of 14O.
On the contrary, the largest spectroscopic factors
for the 1/2−
1 state are to the ﬁrst and second excited
2 of 14O, whereas the spectroscopic
states 1−
factor to the ground state is only S(1/2−)
= 0.0035.

is shown in Fig.

the experimental results and with of R-Matrix ﬁt is
good. The calculated cross section above the 5/2+
1
resonances is lower than the data. This could be
explained by the absence of the unknown higher-
lying resonances taken into account in the R-Matrix
ﬁt (see text).

6. Discussion

It is tempting to compare a pattern of the reso-
nances in N = Z nucleus (8Be) and in N < Z nu-
cleus (15F). Obviously, the sequence of decay chan-
nels in 8Be and 15F is quite diﬀerent. Nevertheless,
in both nuclei one ﬁnds resonances in the vicinity of
the second decay threshold which carry an imprint
of this decay channel. S1p ≃ S1n in 8Be and there-
fore one ﬁnds close lying doublets of the strongly
mixed states. This mixing can be understand in an
avoided crossing scenario which leads to signiﬁcant
width redistribution. In 15F, S1p ≪ S1n and conse-
quently the partner state in the doublet is at high

6

1 → 1/2+

energies and does not mix with the near-threshold
1/2−

1 state.
Electromagnetic transitions between resonances
have been rarely observed, e.g.
in the unbound
nucleus 8Be [47, 48], and in 56Cu [49]. The sec-
ond excited state of 15F being a long-lived reso-
nance, a γ−transition from this resonance to the
g.s. resonance is conceivable. E1 transitions occur-
ring between 2s1/2 → 1p1/2 single-particle states
In 11Be, the
are expected to be extremely fast.
1 γ-transition is the fastest known
1/2−
dipole transition between bound states. This re-
markable property is due to the neutron halo struc-
ture of 11Be [50]. The γ-width is larger since the
electric transition is proportional to the radial inte-
gral R uf (r) r ui(r)dr where uf,i(r) are ﬁnal and ini-
tial radial wave functions of the nucleon, the ground
state of 11Be having a very extended radial wave
function. This is also the case of 15F. Taking this
property into account and the neutron/proton ef-
fective charge diﬀerence, we predict Γγ ≈ 50 eV.
It would be interesting to measure these γ-rays in
order to elucidate the structure of this unique 1/2−
1
state and its 1s1/2 content. These γ-rays will be in
coincidence with protons emitted from the ground
state of 15F. Other narrow resonances in 15F which
were predicted in 15F at higher excitation energies
[24, 25] remain to be observed. The existence of
relatively narrow resonances at high excitation en-
ergies may be actually more frequent than thought
opening a possibility for the particle and gamma
resonance spectroscopy in nuclei far beyond the drip
lines.

7. Conclusion

In summary, the resonant elastic scattering tech-
nique was employed with a post-accelerated ra-
dioactive beam of 14O in order to study the struc-
ture of the 15F low-lying states. Thanks to the high
beam quality, an excellent energy resolution was ob-
tained. The second excited state of 15F with spin
Jπ = 1/2−
1 was observed as a narrow resonance lo-
cated above the Coulomb barrier.

The structure of the observed resonances has
been analyzed using GSM. In both models which in-
clude the coupling to the continuum of decay chan-
nels and scattering states, the narrow resonance
(1/2−
1 ) is dominated by a diproton conﬁguration.
The non-resonant continuum s1/2 plays an essential
role in the structure of this state. The diproton na-
ture of 1/2−
1 state implies that the 1p decay width

7

is suppressed as compared to widths of low-lying
levels 1/2+

1 and 5/2+
