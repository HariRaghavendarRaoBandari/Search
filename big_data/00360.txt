The scalar sector of the minimal Left-Right model at TeV scale is revisited in light of the large
quartic coupling needed for a heavy ﬂavor-changing scalar. The stability and perturbativity of the
eﬀective potential is discussed and merged with constraints from low-energy processes. Thus the
perturbative level of the Left-Right scale is sharpened. Lower limits on the triplet scalars are also
derived: the left-handed triplet is bounded by oblique parameters, while the doubly-charged right-
handed component is limited by the h → γγ, Zγ decays. Current constraints disfavor their detection
as long as WR is within the reach of the LHC.

INTRODUCTION

The standard model (SM) describes all the known par-
ticle interactions and their masses, except for the neu-
trino that is massless within the model, in contrast with
the evidence of neutrino oscillations. An appealing so-
lution is provided by the Left-Right symmetric model
(LRSM) [1, 2], proposed to explain the most evident
misfeature of the SM, that is the glaringly asymmetric
chiral structure of the weak interactions. Incidentally, it
has arisen as a complete theory for the origin of neutrino
masses [3].

Left-Right theories possess a rich phenomenology, nat-
urally embed the seesaw mechanism [3, 4] and, with the
right-handed (RH) scale in the TeV region, provide a
potentially dominant contribution to neutrino-less dou-
ble beta decay (0ν2β) [5–7]. This contribution, due to
the RH neutrino (N), could even be favored in the light
of future cosmological bounds on the neutrino masses.
Keung and Senjanović (KS) [8] proposed a low energy
equivalent, where the heavy Majorana neutrino produc-
tion could reveal LNV at colliders [9]. Recently, a com-
plementary process [10] was analyzed at the LHC [11],
looking for LNV in the SM-like Higgs decay.
The LRSM is based on the gauge group GLR =
SU (2)L × SU (2)R × U (1)B−L plus either a generalized
parity P or charge conjugation C [12]. The model is pre-
dictive in a number of ways: the Dirac neutrino coupling
is univocally determined from the light and heavy neu-
trino mass [13], with direct consequences for LHC and
for the electric dipole moment of the electron [13]. More-
over, in case of P, the strong CP phase [14] and the quark
ﬂavor mixing in the RH sector are computable from the
standard Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix [15].

d,s oscillations [12, 16–19]. These, together with
B0
CP-violating processes, such as ε(cid:48), ε [20] and the elec-
tric dipole moment of the neutron [14], set a lower limit
on the mass of the RH gauge boson MWR > 2.9 TeV.
In the case of P, the latter can set a substantial bound
MWR > 20 TeV in case the strong CP problem is taken
into account within the model [14].

Most of the above limits are in fact dominated by the
tree-level exchange of ﬂavor changing (FC) scalars [21],
which have to be heavy.
Their heavy masses re-
quire potentially large quartics that may become non-
perturbative. This might be considered as a weak point
of the minimal LRSM (see e.g. [22]), apparently spoiling
the appeal of a predictive theory of neutrino masses.

The scalar potential of the LRSM with spontaneous
parity breaking [2] has been the object of study from
the original works to subsequent [23–27] and recent stud-
ies [28–30]. Nevertheless, a perturbativity analysis of the
scalar potential was missing in literature until now. We
provide this missing piece with a loop analysis and a
renormalization of the Higgs sector. This leads to an
eﬀective potential and to a determination of the param-
eter space favored by perturbativity. In turn, it leads to
a reﬁned limit on the masses of WR and the FC scalars.
The entire analysis below holds for both the cases of P
and C.

Furthermore, we assess the domain of perturbative
regime for the mixing between the RH Higgs boson ∆0
R
and the SM-like one, within the phenomenologically in-
teresting region for collider searches [11].

Finally, the fairly large FC-scalar quartic also has an
impact on oblique parameters and on the SM Higgs
diphoton rate. These in turn set a lower bound on
the left-handed triplet multiplet and the doubly charged
component of the RH one. Therefore, an observation of
WR at the LHC would practically exclude the production
of the entire left-handed triplet multiplet in the minimal
LRSM. It would also allow for marginal space to observe
the RH doubly charged component. On the other hand,
the neutral RH Higgs remains fairly unconstrained and
should be searched for at the LHC.

With the quantum number assignment φ ∈ (2L, 2R, 0),
∆L(R) ∈ (3L(1L), 1R(3R), 2B−L) under GLR, the most
general potential (V) is constructed [2]. Since the basic
feature of the LRSM is restoration of parity, an addi-
tional restriction is imposed on V for the case of P and
C. See Eqs. (A2) in the Appendix for the most general
potentials.

In the following sections, we brieﬂy review the minimiza-
tion of the potential and the generation of the scalar mass
spectrum of the LRSM.

A. Minimization of VP,C

The minimization equations can be written as

(4)

∂viV = 0 ,
for all vi ∈ {v1, v2, vR, vL, θL, α}.
In what follows, we
stick to the P potential. The case of C follows straight-
forwardly and the results are summarized in the Ap-
pendix A.

The ﬁrst three conditions in Eq. (4) provide µ2

i as a
function of the vevs and the quartic couplings, shown
in (A3)-(A5). The derivative on α provides a rela-
tion (A6) between the CP phases [24], which for small
ε and x reads

This requires fairly small βi (cid:46) 10−4, which are techni-
cally natural, both from fermion loops because of small
neutrino Dirac masses, and from scalar loops since they
are self-proportional. Even so, a stabilizing symmetry
can be imposed [23, 25, 27] to guarantee a small vL.

The remaining minimization condition on the deriva-
tive with respect to θL is automatically satisﬁed when
vL → 0. In any case, for the purpose of this work βi play
no signiﬁcant role, hence we drop them from here on.

B. Masses and physical states

Let us now construct the Hessian of V and use the min-
imization solutions in (A3)-(A5) and (6). The positivity
condition on the potential requires positive eigenvalues
of the Hessian, which corresponds to positive squared
masses of all the scalars. In this way, 8 × 8, 4 × 4 and
2 × 2 matrices for squared masses of the neutral, singly
and doubly charged ﬁelds are obtained.
At zero order (, x → 0) these matrices are already di-
agonal. At higher orders in ε, subleading oﬀ-diagonal
terms appear and one can solve the eigensystem per-
turbatively at given order, taking care of the would-be-
Goldstone components. ∆L decouples in the limit of
vL → 0.

At ﬁrst order in ε and O(cid:0)x2, ε x(cid:1), we get the SM Higgs

TABLE I. Masses and states in the LRSM (P).

All the other scalars have the leading mass terms pro-
portional to vR with subleading electroweak corrections;
the spectrum is shown in Table I. The same result
holds for the case of C, except for the masses of the
FC scalars, quoted in the Appendix A, where the extra
phases present in the potential cause modiﬁcations.

C. Flavor changing eﬀects

The Yukawa couplings of H and H(cid:48) to SM fermions lead
to a non-diagonal Lagrangian in the ﬂavor space [21].
2 As a consequence, FC processes such as meson oscil-
lations, occur at tree-level and this sets the masses of
H(H(cid:48)) to be fairly heavy. A well known example is the
one of K 0 − ¯K 0 mixing [12, 16–18] where H, H(cid:48) and WR,
through the usual box diagrams, contribute to the pro-
cess. As a result, the bound on the model manifests as a
correlated constraint between MWR and mH,H(cid:48).

d,s − ¯B0

Along this line, it was shown in [19] that constraints
from B0
d,s are even more stringent than the ones
from the Kaon sector, partially due to loop corrections to
the tree-level FC contribution. From (3) and the leading
masses of H, H(cid:48) in Table I,

(11)
it is clear that a fairly large α3 is required for a low
RH scale to be compatible with B mixing. We inciden-

2 A comment on possible FC eﬀects of the SM-like Higgs boson
is in order. The state shown in (8) leads to a diagonal Yukawa
couplings in the Lagrangian, reproducing the SM. Expanding (8)
to higher orders, FC eﬀects occur because of small mixing with
H,H(cid:48) ≈ 10−5, however the related phe-
H(H(cid:48)) of order m2
nomenology is beyond current experimental search.

tally add that a sizeable x reduces α3 for a given mH in
the above mass relation, but simultaneously increases the
couplings to fermions, thus worsening the perturbativity
of α3 [12, 21]. In addition, it also increases the mixing of
H with ∆0
R and further exacerbates the problem. There-
fore we stick to x (cid:28) 1 in what follows, the general case
requires a dedicated study [33].

The size of α3 can be approximated as a function of

MWR as [19]

α3 ≈

30

(MWR /2.23 TeV)2 − 1

.

(12)

This relation may generate a tension in the LRSM
for low scale of MWR, where α3 becomes large and po-
tentially non-perturbative. Therefore, an evaluation of
quantum corrections to the classical potential is in order,
and we discuss it in the following section.

III. PERTURBATIVITY AND POTENTIAL AT

QUANTUM LEVEL

An early discussion of perturbativity was presented al-
ready in [21], and a rough further estimate was made
by [34] in the study of meson oscillations. The authors
estimate the perturbative regime as mH < 10 MWR. In
order to update and clarify the perturbative status of
the LRSM, we study the eﬀective potential and focus on
terms generated by the large α3.
In subsection III A,
we ﬁrst renormalize the model and then build the eﬀec-
tive potential. We compare the tree-level vertices with
the one-loop correction in subsection III B, where per-
turbativity constraints on the relevant LRSM parameters
emerge.

A. The eﬀective potential

a. Renormalization.

In order to construct the eﬀec-
tive potential, one has to renormalize the theory with
proper counter-terms. To illustrate the point, we ﬁrst fo-
cus on the vertices related to ∆0
R and generalize to other
ones below. For the present purpose, we demonstrate
that only δµ3 and δρ1 need to be introduced

The following renormalization conditions are imposed:

This procedure ensures the ﬁniteness of one loop contri-
butions to any n-leg interaction of the scalars, delineat-
ing the eﬀective potential. It also allows one to focus on
interaction terms while keeping masses intact.

c. Stability. The quantum corrections in (18) may
be dominated by α3, which also aﬀects the stability of
the potential. This assessment requires an expansion of

Incidentally, the sizeable α3 contribution in the eﬀec-
tive potential relaxes the destabilizing role of RH neutri-
nos [36], as described below.

B. Perturbativity constraints

In this section, we assess the level of perturbativity within
the LRSM parameter space. Ultimately, one is inter-
ested in the mass scales of the theory, therefore we con-
sider those parameters that are responsible for the lead-
ing mass contribution in Table I, in particular α3 and
also ρ1,2,3.

We generalize the renormalization procedure outlined
above, include the proper counterterms ﬁxed by diagrams
in Fig 1 and follow the same scheme. Each vertex of Vef f
will receive one loop contributions from many couplings,
diﬀerent from the tree-level one. This leads to correlated
bounds, driven by vertices and suppressed by masses. We
ﬁnd that a reliable measure of perturbativity is given by
purely self-induced corrections, computed by taking only
one large coupling at the time. The dominant ones are
four-leg vertices from Figs. 1 and 2, while the three-leg
are less stringent. The ratio between the self-generated
1-loop and the corresponding tree-level parameter is then

3 In [37] an upper limit on α3 was claimed from the requirement
of boundedness of the classical potential. However, we note that
the α3 term in the scalar potential is positive deﬁnite, therefore
no upper bound on α3 can exist. We note that this result was
used in a few subsequent works [38].

FIG. 1. Divergent diagrams that ﬁx the counter-terms in
Eq. (13).

Let us ﬁrst focus on the divergent parts of diagrams
in Fig. 1. It is enough to stick to the diagrams in which
heavy scalars with mass dominated by α3 are propagat-
ing. The generalization to the loops with the propagating
∆0

R is straightforward.
With the above renormalization conditions, the diver-
gent parts of the tadpole and mass diagrams in Fig. 1

It should be kept in mind that when the actual physical
RHH scattering) are considered, the
processes (e.g. ∆0
vertices of the interaction will typically be suppressed
with respect to those in Vef f . This is due to non-zero
masses and momentum ﬂowing in the loop. Both will
regulate the loops and make the perturbative expansion
more stable as the evaluation of the Vef f .

In addition to perturbativity of the eﬀective poten-
tial, one may consider requiring tree level unitarity of
the scattering of LRSM scalars. The bounds from the
optical theorem imply ρ1,2 < 2π, α3, ρ3 < 8π. These are
close or slightly more stringent than the ones from 100%
perturbative level for ρ1,2, α3, while for ρ3 the unitarity
bound matches with ∼ 50% perturbativity.

IV. MASS SCALES IN TEV LRSM

The discussion in the previous section was independent of
the LR scale, i.e. the perturbativity measure in Eqs. (20)-
(23) are independent of MWR. Here we apply those re-
sults on the mass spectrum of the LRSM scalars.

In subsection IV A, we analyze the level of perturba-
tivity for given masses of H and WR, we then consider
the mixing θ of the SM Higgs with ∆0
R in IV B, fol-
lowed by limits on the RH neutrino from the stability
of Vef f in IV C. Finally, in subsections IV D and IV E,
we deal with implications of α3 on the mass of ∆L due
R via radiative Higgs de-
to oblique parameters and ∆++
cays to γγ(Zγ).

A. B mixing and WR

d,s − B

in Eq. (12), impose a bound on MWR for a given per-
turbative level, as shown on Fig. 3.
In [19] a rough
evaluation of such bound for 100% perturbativity led to
(cid:38) 3 TeV. As clear from Fig. 3, the improved treat-
MWR
ment basically conﬁrms that result with a slight increase.
It is worth noting that the α3 vertices from the scalar
d,s analysis
potential could directly aﬀect the B0
after the renormalization of the H propagator as in the
scheme of [34], where only gauge interactions were taken
into account. The ensuing modiﬁcation of Eq. (12) turns
out to be ∼ 2%, therefore the B mixing bound remains
reliable even with α3 close to the unitarity bound.

d,s − B

B. Higgs mixing

R

Using the results of the previous section, one can un-
derstand the perturbative range of couplings relevant for
the h − ∆0
R Higgs mixing. In the physically interesting
< O(TeV), its quartic ρ1 is small and thus
region m∆0
perturbative. As a result, α1 also turns out to be small,
for a given mixing angle, from (10). The point is then,
that the correction to the mass of the Higgs in Eq. (9)
becomes sizeable and needs to be canceled by a large λ1
in order to preserve the light SM Higgs.

To a good approximation λ1 can be determined for

given m∆0

R

and θ as

4v2λ1 (cid:39) m2

h + θ2m2
∆0
R

,

(25)

which shows that with signiﬁcant mixing θ, λ1 becomes
R in the TeV range. At this point λ1 may
large for ∆0
clash with Eq. (24), derived in the small α1 limit, which
translates into an upper bound on the mixing for a given
R mass, shown in Fig. 4. A considerable mixing is
∆0
allowed for ∆0
R, whose mass can lie in the TeV range,
still in perturbative regime.

6

FIG. 5. An upper limit on mN from the stability of the ef-
fective potential. The limit depends on α3, which in turn is
perturbatively restricted (see text). The gray vertical bands
correspond to regions disfavored by perturbativity at 10%,
50%, 100% (right to left) as from Fig. 3.

D. Oblique parameters and ∆L

Oblique parameters, in particular the S and T , impose
signiﬁcant constraints on SU (2)L multiplets near the EW
scale. The isospin violating T parameter is in principle
sensitive to vL and mass splittings within the ∆L mul-
tiplet [23, 40]. However, due to the smallness of vL (see
Eq. (7)), only mass splittings are relevant.

In contrast to the stand-alone type II scenario, where
the mass splitting is arbitrary, the embedding in the
LRSM ﬁxes the size and the sign of the spectrum. From

which is quite robust, with corrections O(vL/v)2.

The splitting in Eq. (28) is set by α3, which in turns
depend on MWR, see Eq. (12). Therefore, at low scales,
the LRSM requires sizeable mass splittings of ∆L com-
ponents. This has two signiﬁcant implications:

1. The splitting of ∆L components induces a large T
parameter, that decouples when the entire multi-
plet is heavy, thus a lower bound emerges. The
relevant oblique parameters are summarized in [41]
and the global ﬁt was performed in [42].
The resulting limit on ∆L is shown on Fig. 6, where
also the contribution of the θ mixing to S and T is
taken into account. Clearly, the resulting bound on
∆L is quite robust and in order to observe ∆L at
the LHC, a fairly large LR scale is required, beyond
the reach of direct WR searches.

R–SM Higgs mixing sθ favored by λ1

Notice that Higgs mixing will signiﬁcantly aﬀect elec-
troweak processes and a stringent constraint on θ vs. the
singlet mass was reported in [39]. However, the situa-
tion in the LRSM is more involved than the singlet case
in [39] due to simultaneous presence of other sources (e.g.
∆L below). A complete study would be in order, but lies
beyond the scope of this paper.

C. Limit on the RH neutrino mass

As mentioned above, the sizeable α3 contribution in the
eﬀective potential is positive, and this relaxes the desta-
bilizing role of RH neutrinos. Their impact was con-
sidered in [36], where the role of quartics was not con-
sidered. Taking the RH neutrinos into account together
with Eq. (19), we estimate

where the gauge boson contribution is subleading and
can be safely neglected. In fact, the B-mixing constraints
imply the lower bound on α3 as from Eq. (12). By con-
sidering this minimal required value of α3, we ﬁnd that
mN below 25 TeV is allowed by stability, regardless of the
LR scale.

The perturbativity upper bound on α3 implies instead
an absolute upper bound on mN, depending on the re-
quired level of perturbativity. From (26) and using the
upper values of α3 from Eq. (20), we have

at 10, 50, 100% perturbativity, as shown on Fig. 5. It
is clear that a quite heavy mN is allowed, without ru-
ining stability or perturbativity. This bound is further
relaxed by the positive contributions of the other quartic
couplings to Vef f .

tivity of 10%, 50%, 100% (right to left) as from Fig. 3. The
R [46]
lower blue bands correspond to direct searches for ∆++

part is due to a cancellation with the SM. The region below
the white dot-dashed line is where ρ2 becomes negative and
is disfavored by the boundedness of the classical potential.

boson contributions are suppressed due to heavy WR and
H + is too heavy to contribute, as clear from Table I. As
discussed above, the entire ∆L multiplet is also heavy,
therefore the dominant contribution comes from ∆++
R .

There are two contributing amplitudes in radiative
channels. One comes from the direct coupling to h, the
other from interference with ∆0
R through the mixing θ.

Since vL is small, c.f. Eq. (7), the W +W − and bb
ﬁnal states are suppressed and the resulting ﬁnal
state is νν, i.e. missing energy.
Ultimately, whether ∆++
decays via cascades or
into same-sign lepton ﬁnal state depends on the size
of the heavy neutrino Majorana Yukawa coupling
(see Fig. 1 in [40]).

L

One might wonder whether a fairly heavy ∆L creates
an additional perturbativity issue. However, it is clear
from Eq. (23) that this is not the case.
In fact, for
MWR (cid:39) 3 TeV, even m∆0
(cid:39) 13 TeV is consistent with
∼ 10% level. Thus the region shown in Fig. 6 is pertur-
batively safe as far as ρ3 is concerned.

from the boundedness of the potential (ρ2 > 0). It is also
relevant for the collider vs. 0ν2β connection, since it con-
strains the rate mediated by WR and ∆++

any additional constraints on charged scalars; in fact even
if the coupling strength limit were the same as γγ, the
Zγ channel would still be less restrictive.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The minimal LRSM oﬀers a predictive framework for the
origin of neutrino masses and understanding parity vi-
olation of the electro-weak interactions. Because of its
predictivity, several constraints emerge on the model. In
particular, the masses of the FC scalars H(H(cid:48)) have to
be large and possibly lead to a tension in the parametric
space of the low scale minimal LRSM. This may have a
serious impact on the stability and perturbativity of the
theory, which we address here.

We systematically study quantum corrections induced
by large α3, responsible for the mass of H. After review-
ing the potential, we perform the one-loop renormaliza-
tion of the relevant part and build the eﬀective potential.
As a ﬁrst result, we show that the stability of the po-
tential is improved thanks to the positive loop contribu-
tion of α3. This signiﬁcantly relaxes the stability bound
on the mass of the RH neutrino.

A reliable evaluation of the perturbative regime of the
LRSM requires a study of the eﬀective potential for all
the relevant vertices. By focusing on those, we provide a
simple conservative assessment of the regions of parame-
ter space consistent with a given degree of perturbativity.
We translate the above bounds on coupling constants
into constraints on physical scalar masses, which we bring
together with the known ﬂavor constraints on the LRSM.
As a result, we ﬁnd that a fairly light WR is compatible
with a perturbative eﬀective potential.

Moreover, we study the mixing θ between the SM Higgs
and ∆0
R, which is a sensitive probe of neutrino mass origin
within the LRSM [11]. We conclude that a signiﬁcant
mixing is perturbatively safe for ∆0

R in the TeV range.

8

We also ﬁnd that α3 drives the oblique T parameter
via ∆L mass splitting. Therefore, a light WR requires a
large mass for the entire ∆L, even in presence of Higgs
mixing. We also ensure that this does not introduce an
additional perturbativity problem related to the size of
the relative quartics ρ3,1.
Last but not least, a large α3 modiﬁes the h → γγ
decay rate, mainly through the ∆++
R loop. In this way,
present experimental constraints imply a correlated lower
bound on m∆++
with MWR, which disfavors both of them
to be easily accessible at the LHC, although some bor-
derline space remains.

R

Notice that as far as the analysis performed in this
paper is concerned, the same logic goes through in the
model where two doublets [2] are considered instead of
the usual triplets. Since the quark Yukawa sector is the
same, it leads to a large FC Higgs mass that will have a
similar issue with perturbativity. It will aﬀect the oblique
parameter in a similar way through the splitting of the
components of the left-handed doublet and the right-
handed singly charged Higgs will enter the h → γγ loop
in a similar fashion.

We conclude that a TeV scale WR requires most of the
scalar spectrum to be relatively heavy, apart from m∆0
,
which remains fairly unconstrained even in the presence
of mixing.

This choice allows for additional complex phases in the

In particular, the couplings µ2, λ2, λ4,
ρ4 and βi are now complex and one has to introduce a
phase δc for each such coupling c. The same applies to
the Yukawa sector leading to additional free phases in
the RH CKM matrix [12, 15].
