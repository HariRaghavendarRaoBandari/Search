We introduce a non-linear extension of Proca’s ﬁeld theory for massive vector

(spin 1) bosons. The associated relativistic nonlinear wave equation is related to re-

cently advanced nonlinear extensions of the Schroedinger, Dirac, and Klein-Gordon

equations inspired on the non-extensive generalized thermostatistics. This is a theo-

retical framework that has been applied in recent years to several problems in nuclear

and particle physics, gravitational physics, and quantum ﬁeld theory. The nonlinear

Proca equation investigated here has a power-law nonlinearity characterized by a

real parameter q (formally corresponding to the Tsallis entropic parameter) in such

a way that the standard linear Proca wave equation is recovered in the limit q → 1.
We derive the nonlinear Proca equation from a Lagrangian that, besides the usual

vectorial ﬁeld Ψµ(~x, t), involves an additional ﬁeld Φµ(~x, t). We obtain exact time

dependent soliton-like solutions for these ﬁelds having the form of a q-plane wave,

and show that both ﬁeld equations lead to the relativistic energy-momentum relation

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 for all values of q. This suggests that the present nonlinear theory

constitutes a new ﬁeld theoretical representation of particle dynamics. In the limit

of massless particles the present q-generalized Proca theory reduces to Maxwell elec-

tromagnetism, and the q-plane waves yield localized, transverse solutions of Maxwell

equations. Physical consequences and possible applications are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

The aim of the present contribution is to advance and explore some features of a non-

linear extension of Proca’s ﬁeld equation. This proposal is motivated by recent developments

concerning nonlinear extensions of the Schroedinger, Dirac, and Klein-Gordon equations [1–

7] related to the non-extensive generalized thermostatistics [8, 9]. These nonlinear equations

are closely related to a family of power-law nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations that describe

the spatio-temporal behavior of various physical systems and processes and have been stud-

ied intensively in recent years [10–17].

The Proca equation [18] constitutes, along with the Dirac and the Klein-Gordon equa-

tions, one of the fundamental relativistic wave equations [19]. It describes massive vector

(spin 1) boson ﬁelds. Historically it played an important role due, among other things, to

its relation with Yukawa’s work on mesons [20]. Proca’s equation shields a generalization of

Maxwell’s electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, by incorporating the eﬀects of a ﬁnite rest mass for

the photon [21]. As such, it is a basic ingredient of the theoretical framework for experimen-

tal studies aiming at the determination of upper bounds for the mass of the photon [22, 23].

This is a basic line of enquiry that can be regarded as having its origins in experimental work

by Cavendish and Maxwell, with their explorations of possible deviations from Coulomb’s

electrostatic force law [22] (although they, obviously, did not formulate this problem in

terms of the mass of the photon). Within the modern approach, the Proca ﬁeld equation

allows for deﬁnite quantitative predictions concerning diverse physical eﬀects originating in

a ﬁnite mass of the photon (including the aforementioned deviations from Coulomb’s law).

This, in turn, motivates concrete experiments for the search of the mentioned eﬀects, and

for determining concomitant upper bounds for the photon’s rest mass. Besides the prob-

lem of establishing bounds to the photon mass, the study of the Proca ﬁeld equation has

been a subject of constant interest in theoretical physics [24–29]. Proca-like modiﬁcations

of electromagnetism have been considered in order to explore possible violations of Lorentz

3

invariance at large distances [25]. The Proca equation with a negative square-mass consti-

tutes a theoretical tool for the analysis of tachyon physics [26]. Among other interesting

aspects of the Proca ﬁeld we can mention the rich variety of phenomena associated with

the coupled Einstein-Proca ﬁeld equations [28], which constitute a natural extension of the

celebrated Einstein-Maxwell equations. Last, but certainly not least, the Proca ﬁeld may

be related to dark matter [29], whose nature is one of the most pressing open problems in

contemporary Science.

The nonlinear Schroedinger, Dirac, and Klein-Gordon equations investigated in [1–7]

share the physically appealing property of admitting (in the case of vanishing interactions)

exact soliton-like localized solutions that behave as free particles, in the sense of comply-

ing with the celebrated Einstein-Planck-de Broglie relations connecting frequency and wave

number respectively, with energy and momentum. Given these previous developments, it is

natural to ask if the corresponding nonlinear extension can also be implemented for massive

vector bosons. This is the question we are going to explore in the present contribution. Of

especial relevance for our purposes is the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation proposed in [1]. It

exhibits a nonlinearity in the mass term which is proportional to a power of the wave function

Φ(x, t). For the above mentioned exact solutions the wave function Φ(x, t) depends on space
and time only through the combination x − vt. This space-time dependence corresponds
to a uniform translation at a constant velocity v without change in the shape of the wave

function. These soliton-like solutions are called q-plane waves and, as already mentioned,

are compatible with the Einstein-Planck-de Broglie relations E = w and p = k, satisfying

the relativistic energy-momentum relation E2 = c2p2 + m2c4. The q-plane waves consti-

tute a generalization of the standard exponential plane waves that arise naturally within a

theoretical framework that extends the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy and statistical me-

chanics on the basis of a power-law entropic functional Sq. This functional is parameterized
by a real index q, the usual BG formalism being recovered in the limit q → 1. The q-plane
waves are complex-valued versions of the q-exponential distributions that optimize the Sq

entropies under appropriate constraints. These distributions are at the core of the alluded

extension of the BG thermostatistics, which has been applied in recent years to a variegated

set of physical scenarios. In particular, several applications to problems in nuclear and par-

ticle physics, as well as in quantum ﬁeld theory, have been recently advanced. As examples

we can mention applications of the q-nonextensive thermostatistics to the study of the nu-

4

clear equation of state [30–32], to neutron stars [33, 34], to the thermodynamics of hadron

systems [35–38], to proton-proton and heavy ion collisions [39–45], to quantum cromody-

namics [46–48], to cosmic rays [49], to the Thomas-Fermi model of self-gravitating systems

[50], to fractal deformations of quantum statistics [51], and to the entropic-force approach

to gravitation [52, 53]. Intriguing connections between the non extensive thermostatistical

formalism and q-deformed dynamics have been suggested [54]. The q-nonextensive thermo-

statistics has also stimulated the exploration of other non-additive entropic functionals that

have been applied, for instance, to black hole thermodynamics [55, 56].

The paper is organized as follows.

In Section II we introduce a Lagrangian for the

generalized Proca ﬁeld that leads to the nonlinear Proca ﬁeld equations. We study some

of its main properties, with special emphasis on the q-plane wave soliton-like solutions. In

Section III we consider the limit of massless particles, obtaining a new family of wave-packet

solutions of Maxwell equations. Some conclusions and ﬁnal remarks are given in Section IV.

II. LAGRANGIAN APPROACH FOR NONLINEAR PROCA EQUATIONS

Let us introduce the four-dimensional space-time operators [19],

as well as the contravariant and covariant vectors

Ψµ ≡ (Ψ0, Ψx, Ψy, Ψz);
Φµ ≡ (Φ0, Φx, Φy, Φz);

Ψµ ≡ (Ψ0,−Ψx,−Ψy,−Ψz),
Φµ ≡ (Φ0,−Φx,−Φy,−Φz).

(2)

(3)

As it will be shown below, these two vector ﬁelds are necessary for a consistent ﬁeld theory,

similarly to the recent nonlinear versions of the Schroedinger and Klein-Gordon equations [2,

7]. For this, we introduce the following Lagrangian density,

L = A(cid:26)−

(4)

where A is a multiplicative factor that may depend on the total energy and volume (in the

case the ﬁelds are conﬁned in a ﬁnite volume V ). Moreover, we are adopting the standard

index-summation convention [19], and the tensors above are given by

Fµν = ∂µΦν − ∂νΦµ ;

˜F µν = ∂µΨν − ∂νΨµ .

The Euler-Lagrange equations for the vector ﬁeld Φµ [19],

∂Φµ − ∂ν (cid:20)
∂L

∂(∂ν Φµ)(cid:21) = 0 ,
∂L

lead to

∇2Ψµ =

m2c2
2 Ψµ (ΨνΨν)q−1 ,

(5)

(6)

(7)

where we have used the Lorentz condition ∂νΨν = 0 [19, 21]. In a similar way, the Euler-

Lagrange equations for the vector ﬁeld Ψµ

∂Ψµ − ∂ν (cid:20)
∂L

∂(∂ν Ψµ)(cid:21) = 0 ,
∂L

(8)

yield

∇2Φµ =

m2c2

2

(cid:2)Φµ (ΨνΨν)q−1 + 2(q − 1)Ψµ (ΦνΨν) (ΨνΨν)q−2(cid:3) .

(9)

One should notice that the equations above recover the linear Proca equations [18, 19, 21]

in the particular limit q = 1, in which case Φµ(~x, t) = Ψµ∗(~x, t). Furthermore, in the one-

6

component limit, Eq. (7) recovers the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation recently proposed

in Ref. [1],

∇2Ψ(~x, t) =

1
c2

∂2Ψ(~x, t)

∂t2

+ q

m2c2

2

[Ψ(~x, t)]2q−1 ,

whereas Eq. (9) reduces to

∇2Φ(~x, t) =

1
c2

∂2Φ(~x, t)

∂t2

+ q(2q − 1)

m2c2
2 Φ(~x, t) [Ψ(~x, t)]2(q−1) ,

(10)

(11)

which corresponds to the additional nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, associated with the

ﬁeld Φ(~x, t), found by means of a Lagrangian approach in Ref. [7].

For general q, the ﬁelds Ψµ(~x, t) and Φµ(~x, t) are distinct, and the solutions of Eqs. (7)

and (9) may be written in terms of a q-plane wave, similarly to the recent nonlinear proposals

of quantum equations [1, 2, 7]. In fact, one has that

Ψµ(~x, t) = aµ expq(cid:20) i
Φµ(~x, t) = aµ(cid:26)expq(cid:20) i

(~p · ~x − Et)(cid:21) ,
(~p · ~x − Et)(cid:21)(cid:27)−(2q−1)





(12)

(13)

,

satisfy Eqs. (7) and (9), provided that the coeﬃcients are restricted to aµaµ = 1. The

solutions above are expressed in terms of the q-exponential function expq(u) that emerges

in nonextensive statistical mechanics [8], which generalizes the standard exponential, and

for a pure imaginary iu, it is deﬁned as the principal value of

expq(iu) = [1 + (1 − q)iu ]

1

1−q ;

exp1(iu) ≡ exp(iu) ,

(14)

where we used limǫ→0(1 + ǫ)1/ǫ = e. Moreover, considering these solutions, one obtains the

energy-momentum relation

E2 = p2c2 + m2c4 ,

(15)

7

from both Eqs. (7) and (9), for all q. Note that, in contrast to what happens with the

standard linear Proca equation, the four equations appearing both in (7) and in (9), besides

being nonlinear, are coupled.

It is remarkable that these sets of four nonlinear coupled

partial diﬀerential equations admit exact time dependent solutions of the q-plane wave form

that are consistent with the relativistic energy-momentum relation (15).

Now, if one introduces the probability density as

ρ(~x, t) =

1

2 (cid:0)ΦµΨµ + Φ∗

µΨµ∗(cid:1) ,

the solutions of Eqs. (12) and (13) yield

ρ(~x, t) = 1 −

(1 − q)2

2

(~p · ~x − Et)2 ,

which require, for positiveness,

|(1 − q)(~p · ~x − Et)| <  .

(16)

(17)

(18)

III. MASSLESS PARTICLES: q-PLANE WAVES AS SOLUTIONS OF

MAXWELL EQUATIONS

The linear Proca equations are usually considered as appropriate for describing vectorial
bosons, or massive photons [19, 21]. Now, if one considers the limit m → 0 in the Lagrangian
of Eq. (4), one eliminates its nonlinear contributions, recovering the electromagnetic La-

grangian without sources [21]. In this case, both Eqs. (7) and (9) reduce to the standard

linear wave equation, described in terms of a single vector ﬁeld (i.e., Φµ(~x, t) = Ψµ∗(~x, t)),

∇2Ψµ =

1
c2

∂2Ψµ
∂t2

.

(19)

As usual, considering ~p = ~k and E = ω, one veriﬁes easily that any twice-diﬀerentiable
function of the type f (~k · ~x − ωt) is a solution of the wave equation. In what follows we
will explore the q-plane wave of Eq. (12) as such a solution; our analysis is based on some

properties of this solution, which are relevant from the physical point of view: (i) It presents
Indeed, for q 6= 1 the

an oscillatory behavior; (ii) It is localized for certain values of q.
q-exponential expq(iu) is characterized by an amplitude rq 6= 1 [57],

8

expq(±iu) = cosq(u) ± i sinq(u) ,

cosq(u) = rq(u) cos(cid:26) 1
q − 1
sinq(u) = rq(u) sin(cid:26) 1
q − 1

arctan[(q − 1)u](cid:27) ,
arctan[(q − 1)u](cid:27) ,

rq(u) = (cid:2)1 + (1 − q)2u2(cid:3)1/[2(1−q)]

,

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

so that rq(u) decreases for increasing arguments, if q > 1. From Eqs. (20)–(23) one notices
that cosq(u) and sinq(u) can not be zero simultaneously, yielding expq(±iu) 6= 0; moreover,
expq(iu) presents further peculiar properties,

[expq(iu)]∗ = expq(−iu) = [1 − (1 − q)iu ]

1

1−q ,

1

1−q ,

expq(iu)[expq(iu)]∗ = [rq(u)]2 = (cid:2)1 + (1 − q)2u2(cid:3)
expq(iu1) expq(iu2) = expq[iu1 + iu2 − (1 − q)u1u2] ,
(cid:8)[expq(iu)]α(cid:9)∗

= (cid:8)[expq(iu)]∗(cid:9)α

= [expq(−iu)]α,

for any α real. By integrating Eq. (25) from −∞ to +∞, one obtains [58],

Iq = Z ∞

−∞

du [rq(u)]2 =

√π Γ(cid:16) 3−q
2(q−1)(cid:17)
q−1(cid:17)
(q − 1) Γ(cid:16) 1

,

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

leading to the physically important property of square integrability for 1 < q < 3; as some
simple typical examples, one has I3/2 = I2 = π . One should notice that this integral
diverges in both limits q → 1 and q → 3, as well as for any q < 1. Hence, the q-plane wave
of Eq. (12) presents a modulation, typical of a localized wave, for 1 < q < 3.

9

Then, identifying the components of the vector of Eq. (2) with the scalar and vector

potentials, Ψµ ≡ (φ, ~A), from which one obtains the ﬁelds [21],

~E = −~∇φ −

1
c

∂ ~A
∂t

;

~B = ~∇ × ~A ,

(29)

one veriﬁes that the wave equations for these potentials are equivalent to the Maxwell

equations in the absence of sources.

Hence, we now consider the following solutions for each Cartesian component j (j =

x, y, z) of the electromagnetic ﬁelds,

Ej(~x, t) = E0j expqhi(~k · ~x − ωt)i ; Bj(~x, t) = B0j expqhi(~k · ~x − ωt)i ,

(30)

which satisfy the wave equation, for each component, provided that ω = c|~k|. Writing
the wave vector as ~k = k~n, where ~n represents a unit vector along the wave-propagation
direction, the Maxwell equations associated with the divergence of the ﬁelds ~E and ~B yield

respectively,

~n · ~E0 = 0 ;

~n · ~B0 = 0 ,

(31)

implying that the ﬁelds ~E and ~B are both perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In

addition to this, considering the solutions of Eq. (30) in Faraday’s Law,

~∇ × ~E +

1
c

∂ ~B
∂t

= 0 ⇒ ~B0 = ~n × ~E0 ,

whereas doing the same in Amp`ere’s Law,

~∇ × ~B −

1
c

∂ ~E
∂t

= 0 ⇒ ~E0 = −~n × ~B0 .

(32)

(33)

The results above show that an electromagnetic wave deﬁned by Eq. (30) corresponds to a

transverse wave, similarly to the plane-wave solution.

10

Now, let us consider the Poynting vector,

~S =

1
2

c

4π (cid:16) ~E × ~B∗ + ~E∗ × ~B(cid:17) =

c

4π| ~E0|2h1 + (1 − q)2(~k · ~x − ωt)2i

1

1−q ~n ,

(34)

as well as the energy density,

u(~x, t) =

1

16π (cid:16) ~E · ~E∗ + ~B · ~B∗(cid:17) =

1

8π| ~E0|2h1 + (1 − q)2(~k · ~x − ωt)2i

1

1−q

.

(35)

One sees from both expressions above an important diﬀerence with respect to those asso-

ciated with the standard plane-wave solution [21], given by a factor, which is essentially a
q-Gaussian of the argument |~k · ~x − ωt|. As a consequence of this factor, one has that

∂t(cid:19)~x
(cid:18)∂u

=

1

4π| ~E0|2h1 + (1 − q)2(~k · ~x − ωt)2i

q

1−q (q − 1)ω(~k · ~x − ωt) ,

(36)

which leads to the interesting result, (∂u/∂t)~x < 0, for a q-plane wave with q > 1, if
~k · ~x < ωt. This result is directly related with the fact that the amplitude of the wave
decreases for increasing arguments, for q > 1, according to Eqs. (20)–(23). Notice that

(∂u/∂t)~x = 0 for q = 1, as a consequence of the fact that the standard plane wave ﬁlls the
whole space.

A. Physical Application: A q-Plane Wave in a Waveguide

Let us now consider the propagation of a q-plane wave in an inﬁnite rectangular waveg-

uide, adjusted appropriately along the wave-propagation direction, which will be chosen
herein to be the ~x-axis, i.e., ~k · ~x = kxx. The total energy carried by the q-plane wave can
be calculated from Eq. (35),

U = Z d~x u(~x, t) =

σ

8π| ~E0|2Z ∞

−∞

dx(cid:2)1 + (1 − q)2(kxx − ωt)2(cid:3)

1

1−q

,

(37)

where σ represents the area of the transverse section of the waveguide. The integral above
may be calculated by means of a change of variables, v = kxx − ωt, in such a way to

use Eq. (28),

U =

σ
8√π

| ~E0|2
(q − 1)kx

2(q−1)(cid:17)
Γ(cid:16) 3−q
Γ(cid:16) 1
q−1(cid:17)

,

11

(38)

leading to a ﬁnite total energy for 1 < q < 3, diverging in the limit q → 1. As a typical
particular case, one has U = σ| ~E0|2/(8kx), for q = 2. Hence, due to its localization in time,
the total energy that a detector can absorb from the q-plane is ﬁnite, in contrast to what

happens with the standard plane wave. This enables the approach of nonlinear excitations

which do not deform in time and should be relevant, e.g., in nonlinear optics and plasma

physics.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We proposed a generalized Lagrangian that leads to a nonlinear extension of the Proca

ﬁeld equation. We discussed some of the main features of this nonlinear ﬁeld theory, focusing

on the existence of exact time dependent, localized solutions of the q-plane wave form. These

solutions exhibit soliton-like properties, in the sense of propagating with constant velocity

and without changing shape. They have a q-plane wave form, which is a generalization

of the standard complex exponential plane wave solutions of the linear Proca equation.

The q-plane waves have properties suggesting that they describe free particles of a ﬁnite

mass m: they are compatible with the celebrated Einstein-Planck-de Broglie connection

between frequency, wave number, energy, and momentum, satisfying the relativistic relation

E = p2c2 + m2c4.

In the limit q → 1, the present nonlinear Proca ﬁeld theory reduces to the Maxwell linear
electrodynamics. We see then that the q-deformation associated with the nonextensive for-

malism turns Proca’s linear ﬁeld theory into its nonlinear generalization, but leaves Maxwell
electrodynamics invariant. As already mentioned, for each value q 6= 1 the associated nonlin-
ear Proca equation admits q-plane wave solutions. In the q → 1 limit, however, the q-plane
wave solutions are solutions of Maxwell equations for all q.

The nonlinear Proca equation here introduced, together with the nonlinear Dirac and

Klein-Gordon equations previously advanced in [1, 7], provide the main ingredients of a

12

nonlinear generalization of the basic relativistic ﬁeld equations for particle dynamics inspired

in the q-thermostatistical formalism. These equations share a family of exact time dependent

solutions: the q-plane waves. The present discussion suggests several possible directions of

future research, such as to study more complex wave-packet solutions, and to consider

interactions. Some progress in these directions has been achieved,

in a non-relativistic

setting, in the case of a nonlinear Schroedinger equation with a power-law nonlinearity in

the kinetic energy term [3–5]. It would be interesting to extend these results to relativistic

scenarios. Another relevant issue for future exploration concerns gauge invariance. As

happens with the standard linear Proca equation, the present nonlinear Proca equation is

not gauge invariant, due to the presence of the mass term. It would be interesting to explore

whether this symmetry can be restored by adding more dynamics to the nonlinear Proca

ﬁeld theory, as is done in the liner theory via the Stueckelberg procedure [23]. Any new

developments along these lines will be very welcome.
