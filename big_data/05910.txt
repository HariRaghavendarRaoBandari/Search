Abstract

We present an algorithm for the reconstruction of the Higgs mass in events with Higgs
bosons decaying into a pair of τ leptons. The algorithm is based on matrix element (ME)
techniques and achieves a relative resolution on the Higgs boson mass of typically 15–20%.
A previous version of the algorithm has been used in analyses of Higgs boson production
performed by the CMS collaboration during LHC Run 1. The algorithm is described in
detail and its performance on simulated events is assessed. The development of techniques
to handle τ decays in the ME formalism represents an important result of this paper.

1 Introduction

A new boson of mass 125 GeV has been observed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1, 2].
The properties of the new particle are compatible with the predictions for the Standard Model
(SM) Higgs (H) boson [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] within the present experimental uncertainties [9, 10,
11, 12]. The observation of its decay into a pair of τ leptons, at a rate that is compatible
with the SM expectation, has been reported recently [13]. The decay into a pair of τ leptons
allows for the most precise measurement of the direct coupling of the SM H boson to fermions.
Decays of heavy resonances into τ lepton pairs furthermore provide high sensitivity to search
for models with an extended Higgs sector, constituting an important experimental signature
at the LHC.
The sensitivity of the SM H → τ τ analysis critically depends on the capability to dis-
tinguish the signal from a large irreducible background, arising from Z/γ∗ → τ τ Drell–Yan
(DY) production. An important handle to separate the signal from the background is the
mass of the τ lepton pair, which we denote by mτ τ . The signal is expected to show up as a
small bump on the high mass tail of the mτ τ distribution of the background (see e.g. Figs.
8, 9, and 11 of Ref. [14]).
The separation of the signal from the background improves if the mass distribution for
the signal is narrow. The SM predicts the total width of the H boson to be ≈ 4 MeV. Present
experimental upper limits on the total width amount to ≈ 10 times the SM value [15, 16].
These limits have been obtained by comparing the rates for oﬀ-shell versus on-shell H boson
production and depend on certain assumptions. Direct, model independent, upper limits on
the total H width, obtained by analyzing the mass spectra in H → ZZ → 4(cid:96) ((cid:96) = e, µ) and
H → γγ events, are ≈ 1 GeV. In contrast, the width of the mτ τ distribution reconstructed
in SM H → τ τ events typically amounts to ≈ 20 GeV and is dominated purely by the
experimental resolution.

Diﬀerent methods for the reconstruction of mτ τ have been discussed in the literature [17,
18, 19, 20, 21]. The SVﬁt algorithm [22] has been used to reconstruct the H boson mass in the
SM H → τ τ analysis as well as in searches for further H bosons predicted by models beyond
the SM performed by the CMS collaboration during LHC Run 1 [23, 24, 14, 25, 26, 27, 28].
Compared to alternative mass variables, the usage of the SVﬁt algorithm has improved the
sensitivity of the SM H → τ τ analysis for measuring the signal rate by ≈ 40% [14]. The
improvement in sensitivity corresponds to a gain by about a factor of two in integrated
luminosity of the analysed dataset.

In this paper we report on the development of an improved version of the SVﬁt algorithm.
The main improvement concerns the rigorous formulation of the algorithm in terms of the
matrix element (ME) method [29, 30]. Whereas the algorithm described in Ref. [22] uses a
likelihood function of arbitrary normalization, the improved algorithm is based on a proper
normalization within the formalism of the ME method. A further improvement concerns the
extension of the algorithm to account for the experimental resolution on the reconstruction
of hadrons that are produced in the τ decays. The two improvements enhance the resolution
on mτ τ achieved by the algorithm by 5–10%.

The development of the formalism to handle τ decays in the ME method constitutes an
important result of this paper, which has not been discussed in the literature so far. The
formalism described in this paper allows one to extend the ME generated by automatized
tools such as CompHEP [31, 32] or MadGraph [33], which treat τ leptons as stable particles,
by the capability to handle τ decays.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the formalism that we devel-
oped to handle τ decays in the ME method and our treatment of the experimental resolution
on the reconstruction of hadrons that are produced in the τ decays. The performance of
the algorithm in terms of achieved mτ τ resolution is presented in Section 3. In Section 4 we
summarize our results.

δ(xa Ea + xb Eb −(cid:80)n

with respect to θ. The symbols Ea and Eb and pa and pb denote, respectively, the energies
s represents the centre-of-mass energy, xa and
and momenta of the two colliding protons,
xb denote the Bjorken scaling variables [34] and f (xa) and f (xb) the corresponding parton
distribution functions (PDF). We use the MSTW 2008 LO PDF set [35] to evaluate f (xa)
and f (xb). We furthermore denote by n the number of particles in the ﬁnal state, by p(i)
the diﬀerential
n-particle phase space element. Vector quantities are represented by bold letters. The sym-
bol |M(p, θ)|2 represents the squared modulus of the ME for the process. The δ-functions
i p(i)) impose energy and momentum
conservation. The set of observables measured in the detector is denoted by y. The function
W (y|p) represents the probability density to observe the measured values y, given a point p
in the n-particle phase space, and is referred to as “transfer function” (TF) in the literature,
while the function Ω(y) is referred to as “indicator function” [36, 37]. The value of the in-
dicator function is 1 for events which pass the event selection criteria and 0 otherwise. The
eﬃciency for an event originating at the phase space point p to pass the event selection, i.e.
to end up with measured observables y for which Ω(y) = 1, is denoted by (p, θ). The symbol
σ(θ) corresponds to the cross section for the process under study, in the case considered in
this paper the production, in pp collisions, of a H boson decaying into a pair of τ leptons
with subsequent decay of the τ pair. The symbol A(θ) represents the acceptance of the event
selection, that is, the percentage of events which pass the event selection criteria. Division
by σ(θ) · A(θ) ensures that P(y|θ) has the correct normalization required for a probability

density, i.e. (cid:82) dy P(y|θ) = 1 for every θ, provided that the TF satisfy the normalization
condition(cid:82) dy Ω(y) W (y|p) = 1 for every p.

The meaning of Eq. (1) is as follows. The best estimate for the unknown model parameter
θ is given by the value ˆθ which maximizes the probability density to observe precisely the
values y that are measured in the detector. Within the scope of this paper, the unknown
model parameter θ corresponds to the mass mH of the H boson or, equivalently, to the true
mass mτ τ of the τ lepton pair in a given event.
The individual terms of Eq. (1) are described in Sections 2.1 to 2.7. The ME for the
process pp → H → τ τ with subsequent decay of the τ leptons via τ → e νe ντ , τ → µ νµ ντ ,
or τ → hadrons + ντ is described in Section 2.1. A complication arises from the fact that we
use a leading order (LO) ME to model the H boson production process pp → H. The LO ME
strictly applies only to events in which the H boson has zero pT, while the production of H
bosons at the LHC typically proceeds in association with jets. The treatment of events with
hadronic activity, in which the H boson has non-zero pT, is detailed in Section 2.2. The TFs
are described in Section 2.3 and the integration over the n-particle phase space is described
in Section 2.4. The computation of the cross section σ(mH) that is needed for a proper
normalization of the probability density P(y|mH) in Eq. (1) is described in Section 2.5. The
numerical maximization of the probability density P(y|mH) with respect to the H boson mass
mH is described in Section 2.6. We conclude this section with a description of an artiﬁcial
term that we choose to add to the probability density P(y|mH), in order to reduce tails in

the mτ τ distribution reconstructed by the algorithm. The structure of this “regularization”
term is described in Section 2.7. Distributions of mτ τ in simulated events, reconstructed with
and without this term, are presented in Section 3.
As a consequence of using LO ME to model the H boson production process pp → H,
the eﬃciency (p, mH) and the acceptance A(mH) cannot be determined reliably, because
they depend on the H boson pT spectrum. In particular for H bosons of low mass mH, the
probability for the particles produced in the τ lepton decays to pass selection criteria on pT
and η, which are necessitated by trigger requirements at the LHC, may vary signiﬁcantly as
function of H boson pT. For this reason, we will assume that mτ τ is reconstructed before
any event selection criteria are applied, i.e. Ω(y) = 1, (p, mH) = 1, and A(mH) = 1 for
all evaluations of Eq. (1). We expect these assumptions to introduce a small bias on the
reconstructed mτ τ values and possibly a small degradation in mτ τ resolution. The bias can
be corrected with the Monte Carlo simulation, and we do not expect it to cause a problem
in practical applications of our algorithm.

2.1 Matrix element
We decompose the squared modulus of the ME, |M(p, mH)|2, for the process pp → H → τ τ
with subsequent decay of the τ leptons into electrons, muons, or hadrons into ﬁve parts:
|M(p, mH)|2 = |Mpp→H→τ τ (p, mH)|2 · |BW(1)

τ→···(p)|2 · |BW(2)

τ→···(p)|2 , (2)

|2 · |M(1)

|2 · |M(2)

τ

where we use the superscripts (1) and (2) to refer to the τ lepton of positive and negative
charge, respectively. The ﬁrst term, |Mpp→H→τ τ (p, mH)|2, represents the squared modulus of
the ME for H boson production with subsequent decay of the H boson into a pair of τ leptons.
This term can alternatively be computed by using automatized tools such as CompHEP or
MadGraph or taken from the literature.
We take |Mpp→H→τ τ (p, mH)|2 from the literature and decompose it into a product of

three factors:

|Mpp→H→τ τ|2 = |Mgg→H|2 · |BWH|2 · |MH→τ τ|2 .

(3)
We model the H boson production using the LO ME for the gluon fusion process gg → H,
which accounts for about 90% of the total H boson production rate at the LHC. The corre-
sponding Feynman diagram is shown in Fig. 1. The squared modulus of the ME reads [38]:

For a SM H boson, the branching ratio B(H → τ τ ) becomes small and the total width ΓH
becomes large once the decay into a pair of W bosons is kinematically possible, i.e.
for
mH (cid:38) 2 mW. We remark that in theories beyond the SM, which motivate the search for
additional heavy scalars, the branching ratio and total width may be very diﬀerent from the

compute |MH→τ τ|2 according to Eq. (9). The branching ratio for the decay H → τ τ and the
total width of the H boson actually have no eﬀect on the value of mτ τ reconstructed by the
algorithm, provided that B(H → τ τ ) and ΓH are used in a consistent way when computing
the squared modulus of the ME |M(p, mH)|2 and the normalization factor 1/σ(mH) in Eq. (1)
in a consistent way.

Concerning the decay of the τ leptons, we again use the narrow-width approximation
(NWA) and assume the τ leptons to be unpolarized, eﬀectively ignoring the correlation of
spins between τ lepton production and decay.
In the NWA, the squared modulus of the
Breit-Wigner propagator |BWτ|2 that associates τ lepton production and decay yields a δ-

Eq. (2) represents the decay of the i-th τ lepton. For the decays τ → e νe ντ and τ → µ νµ ντ ,
which we refer to as “leptonic” τ decays, we take the ME from the literature. Assuming the
τ leptons to be unpolarized and taking the average over the spin states of the τ lepton, the
squared modulus of the ME is given by [41]:

The modelling of the decays τ → hadrons + ντ by matrix elements is more diﬃcult, due to
the fact that τ leptons decay to a variety of hadronic ﬁnal states, and because some of the
decays proceed via intermediate vector meson resonances [40]. We refer to these decays as
“hadronic” τ decays. The ME for the dominant hadronic τ decay modes are discussed in the
literature [42, 43]. In this paper, we use a simpliﬁed formalism and treat τ → hadrons + ντ
decays as two-body decays into a hadronic system τ h of momentum pvis and mass mvis plus
a ντ. The squared modulus of the ME for the decay is taken to be constant and denoted
by |Meﬀ
|2 is chosen such that it reproduces the measured
branching fraction for hadronic τ decays. The following relation holds for the considered case
of a two-body decay:

We use the term “visible” τ decay products to refer to the sum of all hadrons produced in

τ → e νe ντ and τ → µ νµ ντ , respectively.

as two-body decays into a hadronic system τ h and a ντ, reproduces the distribution in z
obtained with a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the τ decays, based on TAUOLA [44].

2.2 Treatment of hadronic activity

The phase-space for QCD radiation is large at the centre-of-mass energies of the LHC and
as a consequence, particles with masses up to a few hundred GeV are typically produced

6

in association with a sizeable hadronic activity [45]. We refer to the vectorial sum of all
particles in the event that do not originate from the H boson decay as the “hadronic recoil”
and denote the corresponding momentum by prec. CMS, as well as ATLAS, have developed
sophisticated techniques to improve the reconstruction of the hadronic recoil [46, 47].

The eﬀect of the hadronic recoil is to modify the kinematics of the H boson decay by
boosting the τ leptons and their decay products, in the transverse plane and in longitudinal
direction. The longitudinal component of prec has a small eﬀect on the Bjorken scaling
variables xa and xb only and can be neglected. However, the components of prec in the
transverse plane need to be accounted for. The LO ME that we use to model the production
of the H boson production is adequate for events without hadronic activity, in which the H
boson has zero pT. In order to use the LO ME in analyses at the LHC, the momenta of the
visible τ decay products and of the neutrinos produced in the τ decays need to be transformed
into a frame in which the H boson has zero pT. The transformation is achieved by a Lorentz
boost in the transverse plane, using ( ˆErec = ˆprec
z = 0) as boost vector. We
denote the true values of energies and momenta by symbols with a hat if they are given in
the laboratory frame, and by symbols a tilde in case they are given in the zero transverse
momentum frame of the H boson. Symbols with neither hat nor tilde denote values measured
in the laboratory frame.

The hadronic recoil is reconstructed with a typical resolution of 10–20 GeV at the LHC [46,
47]. It is demonstrated in Ref. [45] that the imperfect reconstruction of the hadronic recoil
in the detector may cause a signiﬁcant bias on the H boson mass reconstructed by the ME
method in case one ignores the experimental resolution on the hadronic recoil. We account
for the experimental resolution by introduction of a TF Wrec(prec

In practice, the experimental resolution on the momenta of electrons, muons and also τ h is
typically negligible compared to the resolution on the hadronic recoil. In good approximation,
the resolution on the hadronic recoil is equivalent to the resolution on the vectorial sum of
the momenta, in the transverse plane, of all particles reconstructed in the event. The latter is
referred to as “missing transverse momentum” and denoted by p miss
T . The following relations
hold for the components of the p miss

These relations are valid on reconstruction level as well as for the true values of the momenta,
i.e. Eq. (21) is valid also in case all px and py are replaced by ˆpx and ˆpy. Approximating
the resolution on the hadronic recoil by the resolution on p miss
has the advantage that the
resolutions on p miss
have been studied in detail and published by the ATLAS as well as CMS
collaborations [46, 47].

2.3 Transfer functions

The treatment of the experimental resolution on the momenta of electrons, muons and τ h
produced in the τ decays, as well as of the hadronic recoil, are detailed in this section. The
resolution on the momentum pvis(i) of the visible τ decay products is parametrized as function
of the true momentum ˆpvis(i) and modeled by TF W (pvis(i)| ˆpvis(i)). The case of hadronic and
leptonic τ decays is described in Sections 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, respectively. The neutrinos produced
in the τ decays are not included in the TF, but are handled separately, by the formalism
detailed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the appendix. The TF Wrec(prec
y ) that we use
to model the experimental resolution on the hadronic recoil is discussed in Section 2.3.3.

2.3.1 Hadronic τ decays

The energy, or equivalently pT, of the τ h is reconstructed with a resolution of 5–25% at the
LHC [48, 49]. The resolution typically varies as function of pT and η and may additionally
depend also on the multiplicity of the charged and neutral hadrons produced in the τ decay.
The resolution on the pT of the τ h is of similar magnitude as the resolution on mτ τ that we

aim to achieve and needs to be taken into account by suitable TF, denoted by Wh(pvis

when evaluating the integral in Eq. (19).

2.4 Computation of phase space integral

The integration over the diﬀerential n-particle phase space element dΦn in Eq. (19) needs to
be done diﬀerently for events in which both τ leptons decay hadronically (“hadronic” τ pair
decays), events in which one τ lepton decays hadronically and one τ lepton decays leptoni-
cally (“semi-leptonic” τ pair decays), and events in which both τ leptons decay leptonically
(“leptonic” τ pair decays). With the approximation that we treat hadronic τ decays as two-
body decays, the integral over dΦn is of dimension 12 in case of hadronic τ pair decays, 15 in
case of semi-leptonic τ pair decays, and 18 in case of leptonic τ pair decays. The diﬀerential
phase space element reads:

The integrand in Eq. (19) depends on the four-momentum of the two τ leptons via the
product f (xa) f (xb) of the PDF, the factor 1/(2 xa xb s), referred to as “ﬂux factor” in the lit-
erature, and via the squared modulus |Mpp→H→τ τ ( ˜p, mH)|2 of the ME for H boson production
and subsequent decay into a τ lepton pair. In addition, it depends on the four-momentum of
the visible τ decay products via the squared moduli |M(1)
τ→···( ˜p)|2 of the ME
for the τ lepton decays and via the transfer functions W (pvis(1)| ˆpvis(1)) and W (pvis(2)| ˆpvis(2)).
The τ lepton energies and momenta need to be computed as function of the integration
variables.

τ→···( ˜p)|2 and |M(2)

The dimension of the integration over the phase-space elements d3pν(i) and d3pν (i) d3pν(i)
can be reduced by means of analytic transformations. Two variables are suﬃcient to fully
parametrize the kinematics of hadronic τ decays. In case of leptonic τ decays, three variables
are suﬃcient. We choose to parametrize hadronic τ decays by the variables z and φinv. The
variable z represents the fraction of τ lepton energy, in the laboratory frame, that is carried
by the visible τ decay products (cf. Eq. (14)). We denote the energy and momentum of the
τ neutrino produced in hadronic τ decays as well as of the neutrino pair produced in leptonic
τ decays by the symbols Einv and pinv. The energy component Einv is related to the variable
z via:

Einv =

Evis .

(31)

1 − z
z

The angle θinv between the pinv vector and the pvis vector is related to the variable z as well,
and is given by Eq. (45) in case of hadronic τ decays and by Eq. (64) in case of leptonic τ
decays. The variable φinv speciﬁes the orientation of the pinv vector relative to the direction
In case of hadronic τ decays, the magnitude of the pinv

vector is equal to Einv. We choose the mass minv of the neutrino pair as third variable to
parametrize the kinematics of leptonic τ decays, so that the magnitude of the pinv vector is

given by
inv. With the convention that minv = 0 for hadronic τ decays,
Eqs. (45) and (64) can be expressed by a common form that is valid for hadronic as well as
for leptonic τ decays:

The τ lepton momentum vector is given by the sum of the pvis and pinv vectors.

The angles θinv and φinv are illustrated in Fig. 4. The pinv vector is located on the surface
of a cone, the axis of which is given by the pvis vector and the opening angle of which is
given by Eq. (32). The variable φinv represents the angle of rotation around the axis of the
cone. The value φinv = 0 is chosen to correspond to the case that the pinv vector is within
the plane spanned by the pvis vector and the beam direction.

The parametrization of the τ decay kinematics by pvis and the variables z and φinv,
respectively by z, φinv, and minv, allows one to simplify the evaluation of the integral in
Eq. (19) considerably. Expressions for the product of the diﬀerential phase space elements

The functions fh and f(cid:96) are given by Eqs. (49) and (65).

Eq. (33) represents the quintessence of what is needed in order to extend the ME gener-
ated by automatized tools such as CompHEP or MadGraph by the capability to handle the τ
decays. Instead of performing an integration over d3pτ (1) d3pτ (2), which treats the τ leptons as
stable particles, one needs to perform the integration over |BW(1)
τ→···( ˜p)|2 dΦ(1) |BW(2)

puted as function of the integration variables z(1), φ(1)
inv, using
Eqs. (31) and (32), where m(i)
inv is equal to zero in case the i-th τ lepton decays hadronically.
The τ lepton momenta can then be used to evaluate the product of the PDF, the ﬂux fac-
tor, and the squared modulus |Mpp→H→τ τ ( ˜p, mH)|2 of the ME for H boson production and
subsequent decay into a τ lepton pair in Eq. (19).

In order to improve the accuracy of the numerical integration, we perform a further
variable transformation, replacing z(2) by tH. The transformation is executed in two steps.
First, we replace z(2) by:

q2
H =

m2

z(1) z(2)

Following Eq. (8) in Ref. [45], we then parametrize q2

H by:

q2
H = m2

H + mH ΓH tan tH .

(34)

(35)

The form of the variable transformation in Eqs. (34) and (35) is chosen such that the Jacobi
factor of the transformation from z(2) to tH is proportional to the inverse of |BWH|2, the
squared modulus of the Breit-Wigner propagator of the H boson in Eq. (7). The Jacobi
factor is given by:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∂z(2)

2.5 Computation of σ(cid:48)(mH)

The integral in Eq. (39) is computed numerically, for H boson masses mH ranging from
50 to 5000 GeV in steps of 1 GeV. The numeric integration is performed using the VAMP
algorithm [53], an improved implementation of the VEGAS algorithm [54]. The result is
used for the purpose of normalizing the probability density P(pvis(1), pvis(2); prec
y |mH) in
Eq. (19).
The cross sections σ(cid:48)(mH) computed in this way cannot be directly compared to literature
values, due to the fact that we are applying the LO ME to events in which the H boson has
non-zero pT. For the purpose of comparing σ(mH) to literature values for the LO gg → H
cross section, we compute the integral in Eq. (39) for the case that the H boson has zero
pT, by inserting two δ-functions, δ(pτ (1)
), into the integrand. We
then use the δ-functions to remove two integration variables analytically before evaluating
the integral numerically. The values of σ(mH) obtained in this way are shown as function of
mH in Fig. 5. The values agree with the literature values for the LO gg → H cross section
within ≈ 10%. The level of agreement is suﬃcient for our purposes.

The series of mass hypotheses is deﬁned by a recursive relation:

The step size δ is chosen such that it is small compared to the expected resolution on

In
order to reduce the computing time, the series is computed in two passes. The purpose
of the ﬁrst pass, which uses a step size δ = 0.10,
is to ﬁnd an approximate value of

2.7 Artiﬁcial regularization term
The mτ τ distribution reconstructed in H → τ τ signal events is expected to peak close to the
true value of the H boson mass, while the distribution of mτ τ obtained for the irreducible
Z/γ∗ → τ τ background is steeply falling in the region mτ τ (cid:29) mZ. The sensitivity to discover
a H boson signal increases if high mass tails in the mτ τ distribution reconstructed for the
Z/γ∗ → τ τ background, arising from resolution eﬀects, are avoided. For this purpose, we
add an artiﬁcial regularization term of form κ · log

3 Results
The performance of the mτ τ reconstruction is studied with simulated samples of H → τ τ and
Z/γ∗ → τ τ events. A SM H → τ τ signal sample for a H boson of mass mH = 125 GeV is
generated with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) program POWHEG v2 [55, 56, 57]. We also
study the mτ τ reconstruction in events containing pseudoscalar H bosons of mass 200, 300,
500, 800, 1200, 1800, and 2600 GeV. The latter samples are generated with the LO generator
PYTHIA 8.2 [58]. In all the cases, the H bosons are produced via the gluon fusion process.
The Z/γ∗ → τ τ background sample is generated with the LO MadGraph program, in the ver-
sion MadGraph aMCatNLO 2.2.2 [59]. All events are generated for proton-proton collisions
at
s = 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy. The samples produced by MadGraph and POWHEG
are generated with the NNPDF3.0 set of parton distribution functions, while the samples
produced by PYTHIA use the NNPDF2.3LO set [60, 61, 62]. Parton shower and hadroniza-
tion processes are modelled using the generator PYTHIA with the tune CUETP8M1 [63].
The latter is based on the Monash tune [64]. The decays of τ leptons, including polarization
eﬀects, are modelled by PYTHIA.

Distributions in mτ τ are computed separately for events in which both τ leptons decay
hadronically (τ hτ h), events in which one τ lepton decays hadronically and the other into a
muon (µτ h), and events in which one τ lepton decays into a muon and the other into an
electron (eµ). The visible τ decay products are required to pass selection criteria on pT and
η, which are motivated by the SM H → τ τ analysis performed by the CMS collaboration
during LHC run 1 [14]. Events in the τ hτ h decay channel are required to contain two τ h of
pT > 45 GeV and |η| < 2.1. Events in the µτ h channel are required to contain a muon of
pT > 20 GeV and |η| < 2.1 and a τ h of pT > 30 GeV and |η| < 2.3. Events selected in the
eµ channel are required to contain a muon with |η| < 2.1 and an electron with |η| < 2.4.
The lepton of higher pT (either the electron or the muon) is required to satisfy the condition
pT > 20 GeV, while the lepton of lower pT is required to satisfy pT > 10 GeV. Similar
selection criteria on pT and η of the visible τ decay products were applied in the H → τ τ
analyses performed by the ATLAS collaboration during LHC run 1 [65, 66].

The mτ τ distributions reconstructed using the improved version of the SVﬁt algorithm
described in this paper are compared to the distributions in mτ τ reconstructed by the previous
version of the SVﬁt algorithm, described in Ref. [22], and by the “collinear-approximation”
(CA) method [17]. The improved version of the SVﬁt algorithm is denoted by SVﬁtMEM
and is used with and without the artiﬁcial regularization term described in Section 2.7. In
the latter case, we use κ = 3 for the µτ h and τ hτ h channels and κ = 2 for the eµ channel.
The value of κ has been chosen such that the optimal resolution on mτ τ , quantiﬁed as

15

described below, is achieved in each channel. We expect the optimal choice of κ to depend
on the experimental resolution on the pT of τ h and on the hadronic recoil, with a smaller
(larger) value of κ to be optimal in case of better (worse) experimental resolution, and we
recommend to perform a reoptimization of κ in practical applications of our algorithm. We
refer to the previous version of the SVﬁt algorithm as “classic” SVﬁt. The mτ τ distributions
reconstructed by the diﬀerent algorithms in Z/γ∗ → τ τ background and H → τ τ signal events
of mass 125, 200, 300, 500, and 800 GeV are shown in Figs. 6 to 8. The axis of abscissae and
the ordinate are drawn in logarithmic scale to better visualize diﬀerences in the high mass
tails.

The distributions in mτ τ reconstructed by the SVﬁtMEM and the classic SVﬁt algorithm,
as well as by the CA method, peak close to the true mass of the τ lepton pair, while the
distributions in mvis, the mass of the visible τ decay products, are shifted towards lower
values. The magnitude of the shift depends on the decay channel. The shift is largest in
the eµ channel and smallest in the τ hτ h channel. This is due to the fact that the fraction
z of τ lepton energy that is carried by the visible τ decay products is typically high in case
of hadronic τ decays and is typically low in case of leptonic τ decays, cf. Fig. 2. The shift
in peak position needs to be accounted for when comparing the resolutions of the diﬀerent
algorithms. We quantify the resolution in terms of the ratio of the standard deviation σ to
the median M of the mass distributions. Note that all algorithms can be trivially calibrated
such that the median of each mass distribution coincides with the true mass of the τ lepton
pair, by scaling the output of the algorithm by a suitably chosen factor that is constant for
all events reconstructed in a given channel. Such trivial calibrations do not change the ratio
σ/M.
The distributions in mτ τ reconstructed by the CA method exhibits pronounced high mass
tails, which reduce the sensitivity of the SM H → τ τ analysis, as, due to resolution eﬀects,
a sizeable fraction of Z/γ∗ → τ τ background events is reconstructed near the signal region
mτ τ ≈ 125 GeV. The resolution, quantiﬁed by the ratio σ/M, is worse for mτ τ reconstructed
by the CA method compared to mvis. A further disadvantage of the CA method is that it fails
to yield a physical solution for approximately half of the events, while all other algorithms
provide a physical solution for every event. The fraction of events for which the CA method
fails to ﬁnd a physical solution is reﬂected by the normalization of the distributions.

In all three decay channels, the SVﬁtMEM algorithm provides a substantial improvement
in the mass resolution. Numerical values of the median M and of the standard deviation σ of
the mτ τ and mvis distributions in simulated Z/γ∗ → τ τ background events and in H → τ τ
signal events of mass 125, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1200, 1800, and 2600 GeV are given in Table 1.
In the SM H → τ τ analysis, the SVﬁtMEM algorithm signiﬁcantly improves the separation of
the signal from the irreducible Z/γ∗ → τ τ background, yielding a substantial gain in analysis
sensitivity. The improvement in mass resolution achieved by the SVﬁtMEM algorithm further
increases in events containing H bosons of high pT, a fact which has been utilized to increase
the sensitivity of the SM H → τ τ analysis performed by the CMS collaboration during LHC
run 1 [14]. In the latter analysis, the usage of mτ τ reconstructed by the SVﬁtMEM algorithm
has increased the sensitivity for measuring the signal rate by ≈ 40%, corresponding to a gain
by about a factor of two in integrated luminosity of the analyzed dataset. Compared to the
classic SVﬁt algorithm, the SVﬁtMEM algorithm yields an improvement in mτ τ resolution by
5–10%. The relative resolution for the SVﬁtMEM algorithm with and without the artiﬁcial
regularization term is similar. The motivation for adding the artiﬁcial regularization term is to
avoid high mass tails in the mτ τ distribution reconstructed in Z/γ∗ → τ τ background events,
albeit on the expense of increasing the low mass tails in the mτ τ distribution reconstructed
in signal events. The reduction of high mass tails is important not only for the SM H → τ τ
analysis, but also in the context of searches for new heavy resonances, as the signal cross
section is expected to fall steeply as function of resonance mass, such that potential high mass

The distributions in mτ τ reconstructed by the SVﬁtMEM algorithm with κ = 3 in the
τ hτ h and µτ h channels and with κ = 2 in the eµ channel are similar to the distributions in
mτ τ reconstructed by the classic SVﬁt algorithm. We conclude that the absence of a proper
normalization of the likelihood function in the classic SVﬁt algorithm has an eﬀect that is
similar to using an artiﬁcial regularization term of the form described in Section 2.7 with
small positive κ.

We want to add two further remarks: First, the distributions in mτ τ reconstructed by the
SVﬁtMEM algorithm exhibit the best resolution in the τ hτ h channel and the worst resolution
in the eµ channel. The diﬀerence in resolution between the τ hτ h, µτ h, and eµ channels is
due to the fact that the fraction z of τ lepton energy carried by the visible τ decay products
is typically higher in hadronic compared to leptonic τ decays. The presence, in the event, of
a τ h of high pT signals the decay of a H boson of high mass, as in this case either the pT of
the visible decay products of the other τ lepton is high too, or the event contains high pT
neutrinos, the momenta of which are imbalanced in the transverse plane, indicating the decay
of a H boson of high mass by means of large p miss
and pmiss
enters the SVﬁtMEM algorithm via Eq. (21). The low mass tail of the mτ τ distribution arises
from events in which the visible decay products of both τ leptons have low pT. If in addition
the τ leptons are “back-to-back” in the transverse plane (∆φτ τ ≈ π), which is typically the
case in H → τ τ events produced via the gluon fusion process, the neutrinos produced in the
two τ decays are emitted in opposite hemispheres, with the eﬀect that their contribution to
p miss
cancels. Such events are indistinguishable from the decays of H bosons of low mass and
T
are hence assigned low mτ τ values by the SVﬁtMEM algorithm.
Second, we remark that the ratio of the median of the mτ τ distribution to the true mass of
the τ lepton pair is closer to unity and the ratio σ/M is smaller for the Z/γ∗ → τ τ background
and for low mass H → τ τ signals, compared to H → τ τ signals of high mass. The reason for
this behaviour are the pT cuts that are applied on the visible τ decay products. The pT cuts
have the eﬀect of removing events in which both τ leptons have low pT. In the majority of
those events, the τ leptons are back-to-back in the transverse plane and hence p miss
is small.
The eﬀect of the pT cuts is present in the τ hτ h, µτ h, and eµ channels and can be seen in the
mvis as well as in the mτ τ distributions, except for the Z/γ∗ → τ τ background in the τ hτ h
channel. In the latter case, the pT > 45 GeV requirement on the τ h removes all Z/γ∗ → τ τ
background in which the Z boson has low pT, as only Z/γ∗ → τ τ events in which the τ h are
boosted in Z boson direction have a chance to satisfy the condition pT > 45 GeV. In events
containing a Z boson of high pT, the τ leptons are typically not back-to-back in the transverse
plane. The mass of the visible τ decay products decreases proportional to the cosine of the
angle between the τ leptons, mvis ≈ pvis(1)
cosh ηvis(2) · (1 − cos (cid:94)(τ , τ ))
and, in events with Z bosons of high pT, may be signiﬁcantly smaller than two times 45 GeV.

4 Summary

An algorithm for reconstruction of the H boson mass in events in which the H boson decays
into a pair of τ leptons has been presented. The relative resolution on the H boson mass
amounts to typically 15–20%. The algorithm has been used in data analyses performed by
the CMS collaboration during LHC Run 1. It improves the sensitivity of the SM H → τ τ
analysis by ≈ 40%, corresponding to a gain in integrated luminosity by about a factor of two.
Two improvements to the algorithm have been developed in preparation for LHC Run 2.
The ﬁrst improvement concerns the rigorous formulation of the algorithm in terms of the ME
method and the proper normalization of the probability density P, given by Eq. (19). The
modelling of the experimental resolution on the pT of τ h via TF in the ME formalism, de-
scribed in Section 2.3.1, constitutes the second improvement. The two improvements enhance

The development of the formalism to handle τ lepton decays in the ME method constitutes
an important result of this paper. The formalism allows one to extend the matrix elements
generated by automatized tools such as CompHEP or MadGraph by the capability to handle
hadronic as well as leptonic τ decays. We expect that the formalism will be very useful for
future applications of the ME method to data analyses with τ leptons in the ﬁnal state.

We derive here the relations for the product of the squared moduli of the ME and the
for, respectively, the decays τ → hadrons + ντ
phase space elements dΦ(i)
and τ → (cid:96) ν(cid:96) ντ , given by Eq. (33). We start with the simpler case of hadronic τ decays in
Section 5.1 and turn to the more complex case of leptonic τ decays in Section 5.2. For clarity
of notation, we omit the hat symbol in this section and use the convention that all symbols
refer to true values in the laboratory frame, unless indicated explicitely otherwise.

5.1 The decay τ → hadrons + ντ
We treat hadronic τ decays as a two-body decay into a hadronic system τ h plus a ντ, as
explained in Section 2.1, and take the squared modulus of the ME to be a constant, which
we denote by |Meﬀ
|2. We further denote the momentum of the neutrino produced in
the τ decay by pinv and its energy by Einv (cf. Section 2.4). For reasons that will become
clear later, we allow the neutrino to have non-zero mass minv.

The equality |Mτ→···( ˜p)|2 = |Mτ→···(p)|2 follows from the fact that the matrix element is a
Lorentz invariant quantity and as such has the same value in any frame. We have used the
identity:

for expressing the second line by the third. Eq. (53) follows from the δ-function rule Eq. (46).
We assume that the mass of the ν as well as the mass of the ν is zero.

We perform a variable transformation from (Eν , pν ) and (Eν , pν ) to:

(u0, u) =

1√

(Eν + Eν , pν + pν ) ,

(v0, v) =

(Eν − Eν , pν − pν ) .

The variables u0 and u represent the energy and momentum of the neutrino pair. The mag-
nitude of the determinant of the Jacobi matrix for the transformation from (Eν , pν ; Eν , pν )
to (u0, u; v0, v) equals unity. Expressed in the new variables, the energy and momentum of
the ν and of the ν produced in the tau decay are given by:

(Eν , pν ) =

(u0 + v0, u + v) and (Eν , pν ) =

The quantity Iinv is a Lorentz invariant quantity. As such, it can be computed in any frame
and will yield the same value as in the laboratory frame. We choose to evaluate it in the rest
frame of the neutrino pair. In this frame, the energy is given by u0 = minv and the momentum
by u = (0, 0, 0), with minv denoting the mass of the neutrino pair. Hence u0 v0−u·v = minv v0
in this frame. Performing the integration over v0, we obtain:

with Eτ and Evis given by Eq. (60). Note that Iinv solely depends on a single kinematic
variable, minv, as mτ and mvis are constants.

Before substituting Eq. (61) into Eq. (54), we perform a variable transformation from
(u0, u1, u2, u3) to (m2
2), u1, u2, u3). The magnitude
of the determinant of the Jacobi matrix for this transformation is |J| = 4 u0, from which it
follows that:

with u0 ≡ Einv and u ≡ pinv. The expression in Eq. (63) is very similar in structure to
the third line of Eq. (41), if we identify the integration over the momentum of the neutrino
pair, given by the phase space element d3u in Eq. (63), with the integration over the neutrino
momentum d3pinv in Eq. (41). The diﬀerences between the formulae for leptonic and hadronic
τ decays are the additional integration over dm2
inv and the factor Iinv/2 in Eq. (63), which
replaces the factor |Mτ→τ hντ|2 in Eq. (41). Note that Eq. (63) as well as Eq. (41) refer to

the laboratory frame. The rest frame of the neutrino pair was used only for the purpose of
evaluating the Lorentz invariant integral Iinv.

Since, according to Eq. (61), Iinv depends solely on the integration variable minv, Iinv can
be treated as a constant when performing the integration over d3pτ and d3u. We can hence
use Eq. (48) of Section 5.1 to express Eq. (63) by:
