MOUSOMI BHAKTA, DEBANGANA MUKHERJEE

Abstract. In this paper we prove the existence of inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions
of the following equations driven by a nonlocal integro-diﬀerential operator LK with
concave-convex nonlinearities and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions

LKu + µ|u|q−1u + λ|u|p−1u = 0
u = 0

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

where Ω is a smooth bounded domain in RN , N > 2s, s ∈ (0, 1), 0 < q < 1 < p ≤ N+2s
N−2s .
Moreover, when LK reduces to the fractional laplacian operator −(−∆)s, p = N+2s
N−2s ,
2 ( N+2s

N−2s ) < q < 1, N > 6s, λ = 1, we ﬁnd µ∗ > 0 such that for any µ ∈ (0, µ∗), there
exists at least one sign changing solution.

1. Introduction

In recent years, a great deal of attention has been devoted to fractional and non-local
operators of elliptic type. One of the main reasons comes from the fact that this operator
naturally arises in several physical phenomenon like ﬂames propagation and chemical re-
action of liquids, population dynamics, geophysical ﬂuid dynamics, mathematical ﬁnance
etc (see [4, 9, 15, 31, 32] and the references therein). In all these cases, the nonlocal eﬀect
was modeled by the singularity at inﬁnity.

In this paper we mainly focus on the following problem with general integro-diﬀerential

operator and concave-convex nonlinearities.

(PK )(LKu + µ|u|q−1u + λ|u|p−1u = 0

u = 0

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

where s ∈ (0, 1) is ﬁxed, N > 2s, Ω is an open, bounded domain with smooth boundary,
0 < q < 1, 1 < p ≤ 2∗ − 1 with 2∗ = 2N
N −2s . Here LK is the non-local operator deﬁned as
follows:

LKu(x) =

(u(x + y) + u(x − y) − 2u(x)) K(y)dy, x ∈ RN .

Here K : RN \ {0} → (0, +∞) is a function deﬁned such that

mK(x) ∈ L1(RN ) with m(x) = min{|x|2, 1};

there exists

for any x ∈ RN \ {0};

and K(x) = K(−x)

for any x ∈ RN \ {0}.

A model for K is given by K(x) = |x|−(N +2s). In this case LK reduces to the fractional

By X we denote the linear space of Lebesgue measurable functions from RN to R such

( see [26, lemma 7]). For further details on X and X0 and for their properties, we refer
to [18] and the references therein. Thanks to (1.2), it can be shown that C 2
0 (Ω) ⊆ X0, see
[27, Lemma 11] and so X and X0 are non-empty .
Deﬁnition 1.1. We say that u ∈ X0 is a weak solution of (PK ) if

ZR2N

(u(x) − u(y))(φ(x) − φ(y))K(x − y)dxdy = µZΩ |u(x)|q−1u(x)φ(x)dx

for all φ ∈ X0.

We denote by H s(RN ) the usual fractional Sobolev space endowed with the so-called

Gagliardo norm

kgkH s(RN ) = kgkL2(RN ) +(cid:18)ZRN ×RN

|x − y|N +2s dxdy(cid:19)1/2
|g(x) − g(y)|2

.

When K(x) = |x|−(N +2s), X0 reduces to nu ∈ H s(RN ) : u = 0 a.e. in RN \ Ωo. When

Ω is bounded, the norm in X0(Ω) is equivalent to

(see [6]). By [18, Proposition 3.6] we have,

A classical topic in nonlinear analysis is the study of existence and multiplicity of so-
lutions for nonlinear equations. There are many results on the subject of concave-convex
nonlinearity involving diﬀerent local and nonlocal operators. Elliptic problems in bounded
domains involving concave and convex terms have been studied extensively since Am-
brosetti, Brezis and Cerami [2] considered the following equation:

−∆u = µuq−1 + up−1

u > 0 in Ω,
u = 0 on ∂Ω,

in Ω,

(Eµ)


where 1 < q < 2 < p ≤ 2N
N −2 , µ > 0 and Ω is a bounded domain in RN . They found that
there exists µ0 > 0 such that (Eµ) admits at least two positive solutions for µ ∈ (0, µ0), one
positive solution for µ = µ0 and no positive solution exists for µ > µ0 (see also Ambrosetti,
Azorero and Peral [3] for more references therein). Later on Adimurthi-Pacella-Yadava [1],
Damascelli, Grossi and Pacella [17], Ouyang and Shi [22] and Tang [29] proved there exists
µ0 > 0 such that for µ ∈ (0, µ0), there are exactly two positive solutions of (Eµ) when Ω is
the unit ball in RN and exactly one positive solution for µ = µ0 and no positive solution
exists for µ > µ0. For the local operator we also quote [8, 12, 13, 20, 34] and the references
therein. In past couple of years many of these results have been generalised to the case of
nonlocal operators, we refer a few among them [5, 6, 10, 11, 19] and the references therein.
As per our knowledge no result for sign changing solution involving non-local operator and
concave-convex nonlinearity has been studied so far.

The main results of our paper are stated below. First we study the critical case p =

The most important theorem in this paper is the following one, where we establish

existence of at least one sign changing solution of (P′

In the succeeding theorem, we prove the existence of inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions

in the subcritical case.
Theorem 1.3. Let Ω be a bounded domain in RN with smooth boundary, N > 2s, s ∈ (0, 1).
Assume 1 < p < 2∗ − 1. Then
(a) For all λ > 0, µ ∈ R, (PK ) has a sequence of nontrivial solutions {uk}k≥1 such
µ (uk) → ∞ as k −→ ∞. Furthermore, if λ > 0, µ ≥ 0, then kukkX0 → ∞ as
(b) For all µ > 0, λ ∈ R, (PK ) has a sequence of nontrivial solutions {vk}k≥1 such
µ (vk) → 0 as k → ∞. Furthermore, if µ > 0, λ ≤ 0, then kvkkX0 → 0 as
Remark 1.2. When K(x) = |x|−(N +2s), Brandle, et. al [10] have proved that there exists
Λ > 0 such that, (PK ) has at least two positive solutions when µ ∈ (0, Λ), one positive
solution when µ = Λ and no positive solution when µ > Λ. For general K satisfying
assumptions (1.2)-(1.4), Chen-Deng [14] have proved that there exists at least two positive
solutions of (PK ) when λ = 1 and µ ∈ (0, µ0) for some µ0 > 0.

that I λ
k → ∞.

To prove inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions of the above stated problems, we apply
the Fountain Theorem and the Dual Fountain theorem which were proved by Bartsch [7]
and Bartsch-Willem [8] respectively (also see [33]). As usual for critical point theorems,
we need to study the compactness properties of the functional together with its geometric
features. With respect to the compactness, we need to prove that the functional satisﬁes
the classical Palais-Smale (PS)c assumption. But observe that X0 ֒→ L2∗(Ω) is not com-
pact (see [25, Lemma 9-b]). Hence the (PS)c condition does not hold globally for all c and
we have to prove that the energy level of the corresponding energy functional lies below
the threshold of application of the (PS)c condition. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is much
delicate. There by using decomposition of Nehari manifold, we have estimated the energy
and proved the existence of at least one sign changing solution. The proof is divided into
several steps. The strategy to obtain a sign-changing solution follows from the ideas given
in [13] (see also [30]) adapted to our nonlocal functional framework.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 is devoted to some notations and preliminar-
ies about Fountain Theorem and Dual Fountain Theorem. In Section 3 we prove Theorem
1.1. In Section 4 we deal with sign changing solution, namely we study Theorem 1.2. In
section 5 we study the subcritical problem, Theorem 1.3, Finally, in Section 6 we state
results for a related problem that can be solved using our methods as in Theorem 1.1 and
we also point out some related open questions in Section 8. Section 7 is appendix.

Notations: Throughout the paper C denotes a general positive constant which may

vary from line to line.

We start this section by recalling two abstract theorems namely the Fountain theorem

and the Dual Fountain Theorem. For this, we need some deﬁnitions from [33].

Deﬁnition 2.1. The action of a topological group G on a Banach space X is a continuous
map

such that

G × X −→ X : [g, u] −→ gu,

The action is isometric if ||gu|| = ||u||. The space of invariant points is deﬁned by

1.u = u,

(gh)u = g(hu),

u 7→ gu is linear.

Fix (G) := {u ∈ X : gu = u ∀g ∈ G}.

A set A ⊂ X is called invariant if gA = A for every g ∈ G. A functional ϕ : X −→ R is
called invariant if ϕ ◦ g = ϕ for every g ∈ G. A map f : X −→ X is called equivariant if
g ◦ f = f ◦ g for every g ∈ G.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let G be a compact group on Banach space X0. Assume that G acts
diagonally on V k

g(v1,··· , vk) := (gv1,··· , gvk),

where V is a ﬁnite dimensional space. The action of G is admissible if every continuous
equivariant map ∂U −→ V k−1, where U is an open bounded invariant neighborhood of 0 in
V k, k ≥ 2, has a zero.

By Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, the antipodal action of G := Z/2 on V := R is admissible

(see [33, Theorem D.17]).

We consider the following situation:

(A1) The compact group G acts isometrically on the Banach space X = Lj∈N Xj, the
spaces Xj are invariant and there exists a ﬁnite dimensional space V such that, for every
j ∈ N, Xj ≃ V and the action of G on V is admissible.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let ϕ ∈ C 1(X, R). We say that {un} is a Palais-Smale sequence (in
short, PS sequence) of ϕ at level c if ϕ(un) → c and ϕ′(un) → 0 in (X)′, the dual space of
X. Moreover, we say that ϕ satisﬁes (PS)c condition if {un} is any (PS) sequence in X
at level c implies {un} has a convergent subsequence in X.
Theorem 2.1. [Fountain Theorem, Bartsch, 1993] Under the assumption (A1), let ϕ ∈
C 1(X, R) be an invariant functional. If, for every k ∈ N, there exists 0 < rk < ρk such
that
(A2) ak := maxu∈Yk,||u||=ρk ϕ(u) ≤ 0,
(A3) bk := inf u∈Zk,||u||=rk ϕ(u) → ∞ as k → ∞.
(A4) ϕ satisﬁes (PS)c condition for every c > 0,

then ϕ has an unbounded sequence of critical values.

Theorem 2.2. [Dual Fountain Theorem, Bartsch-Willem, 1995] Under the assumption
(A1), let ϕ ∈ C 1(X, R) be an invariant functional.
If, for every k ≥ k0, there exists
0 < rk < ρk such that
(D1) ak := inf u∈Zk,||u||=ρk ϕ(u) ≥ 0,
(D2) bk := maxu∈Yk,||u||=rk ϕ(u) < 0,
(D3) dk := infu∈Zk,||u||≤ρk ϕ(u) → 0 as k → ∞.
(D4) For every sequence urj ∈ X and c ∈ [dk, 0) such that

urj ∈ Yrj , ϕ(urj ) → c and ϕ|′

(urj ) → 0 as
contains a subsequence converging to a critical point of ϕ,
then ϕ has a sequence of negative critical values converging to 0.

=1|u|Lp+1(Ω) → 0

as k → ∞.

Proof. Clearly, 0 < βk+1 ≤ βk. Thus there exists β ≥ 0, such that limk→∞ βk = β.
By the deﬁnition of βk, for every k ≥ 1, there exists uk ∈ Zk such that kukk = 1 and
|uk|Lp+1(Ω) > βk
2 . Using the deﬁnition of Zk, it follows uk ⇀ 0 in X0. Therefore Sobolev
embedding implies uk → 0 in Lp+1(Ω) and this completes the proof.

Hence applying the above claim, we see that (D4) holds true. Therefore the result follows
by Theorem 2.2.

Here we prove the claim dividing into four steps.
Step 1: {urj} is bounded in X0.
This follows by standard arguments. More precisely, since I(urj ) = c+o(1) and(cid:10)I ′(urj ), urj(cid:11) =
o(1)||urj||X0, computing I(urj )− 1
C2|urj|q+1

Lq+1(Ω). Therefore using the deﬁnition of I along with Sobolev inequality yields

2(cid:10)I ′(urj ), urj(cid:11) , we get |urj|2∗
L2∗ (Ω) ≤ C1 +(cid:13)(cid:13)urj(cid:13)(cid:13)X0
X0 i
X0 ≤ Ch1 + ||urj||X0o(1) + ||urj||q+1

and hence the boundedness follows. Therefore passing to a subsequence if necessary we
may assume urj ⇀ u in X0, urj → u in Lγ(RN ) for 1 ≤ γ < 2∗ and point-wise.

Step 2: {urj} is a PS sequence in X0 at level c, where c is as in (3.4).
To see this, let v ∈ X0 be arbitrarily chosen. Then

Therefore, using Sobolev inequality and Step 1 we have,

(cid:10)I ′(urj ), v(cid:11) =(cid:10)urj , v(cid:11) −ZΩ |urj|2∗−2urj vdx − µZΩ |urj|q−1urj vdx.

which in turn implies (cid:13)(cid:13)I ′(urj )(cid:13)(cid:13)(X0)′ ≤ M for all j ≥ 1.

By the deﬁnition of Yrj , there exists a sequence (vrj ) ∈ Yrj such that vrj → v in X0 as

rj → ∞. Thus

|(cid:10)I ′(urj ), v(cid:11) | ≤ |(cid:10)I ′(urj ), vrj(cid:11)| + |(cid:10)I ′(urj ), v − vrj(cid:11)|

Combining the hypothesis I ′|Yrj
(urj ) → 0 as rj → ∞ (see (3.3)), Step 1 and the fact that
{I ′(urj )} is uniformly bounded, we have |(cid:10)I ′(urj ), v(cid:11) | → 0 as rj → ∞. This in turn implies
that {urj} is a PS sequence in X0 at level c, where c is as in (3.4).
Step 3: u satisﬁes (P′

Using Vitali’s convergence theorem via H¨older inequality and Sobolev inequality, it is not
diﬃcult to check that we can pass the limit rj → ∞ in (3.5), Thus we obtain hI ′(u), vi = 0
for every v in X0. Hence, LKu + µ|u|q−1u + |u|2∗−2u = 0 in Ω.

We note that vε 6∈ X0. Therefore we multiply vε by a suitable cut-oﬀ function ψ in order
to put vε to 0 outside Ω. For this, ﬁx δ > 0. Deﬁne Ω1 = {x ∈ Ω : dist(x, ∂Ω) > δ}. We
choose ψ ∈ C ∞(RN ) such that 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1, ψ = 1 in Ω1, ψ = 0 in RN \ Ω and ψ > 0 in Ω.
We deﬁne
(4.5)
To obtain sign changing solution of (P ), we need to study minimization problems of Iµ
over suitable Nehari-type sets. We deﬁne the following sets in the spirit of [30] (also see
[13])

uε(x) := ψ(x)vε(x).

µ(u), u(cid:11) = 0};

N := {u ∈ X0 \ {0} :(cid:10)I ′

L2∗ (Ω) = 0o;
L2∗ (Ω) > 0o;
L2∗ (Ω) < 0o.

From [14], it is known that there exists µ∗ > 0 such that, if µ ∈ (0, µ∗), then the following
minimization problem:

Moreover w0 and w1 are critical points of Jµ. Using maximum principle [28, Proposition
2.2.8] and followed by a simple calculation , it can be checked that, if u is a critical point
of Jµ, then u is strictly positive in Ω (see [6]). Thus w0 and w1 are positive solution of
(P). Applying the Moser iteration technique it follows that any positive solution of (P ) is
in L∞(Ω) (see [6, Proposition 2.2]).

We need the following lemmas in order to prove Theorem 1.2.

Lemma 4.1. Suppose w1 is a positive solution of (P ) and uε is as deﬁned in (4.5). Then

We prove the next three lemmas in the spirit of [30].

Lemma 4.3. Let µ ∈ (0, ˜µ). For every u ∈ X0, u 6= 0, there exists unique

0 < t−(u) < t0(u) =(cid:18)

(1 − q)kuk2

such that

t−(u)u ∈ N + and
t+(u)u ∈ N − and

Iµ(t−u) = min
t∈[0,t0]
Iµ(t+u) = max
t≥t0

Iµ(tu),

Iµ(tu).

Proof. From (4.1), for t ≥ 0,

Iµ(tu) =

Iµ(tu) = tq(cid:18)t1−q kuk2 − t2∗−q−1|u|2∗

L2∗ (Ω) − µ|u|q+1

Lq+1(Ω)(cid:19).

By a straight forward computation, it follows that φ attains maximum at the point

φ(t) = t1−q kuk2 − t2∗−q−1|u|2∗

L2∗ (Ω).

t0 = t0(u) =(cid:18)

Thus

t > t0.

(4.14)

Moreover, φ(t0) = (cid:0) 1−q

there exists t+(u) > t0 > t−(u) such that

φ(t+) = µZΩ |u|q+1 = φ(t−) and φ′(t+) < 0 < φ′(t−).

(4.16)

MULTIPLICITY AND SIGN CHANGING SOLUTIONS

13

This in turn, implies t+u ∈ N − and t−u ∈ N +. Moreover, using (4.14) and (4.16) in

the expression of ∂

∂t Iµ(tu), we have

∂
∂t

Iµ(tu) > 0 when t ∈ (t−, t+) and

∂
∂t

Iµ(tu) < 0 when t ∈ [0, t−) ∪ (t+,∞),

∂
∂t

Iµ(tu) = 0 when t = t±.

We note that Iµ(tu) = 0 at t = 0 and strictly negative when t > 0 is small enough.
Therefore it is easy to conclude that

Iµ(tu) = Iµ(t+u)

max
t≥t0

and min
t∈[0,t0]

Iµ(tu) = Iµ(t−u).

Lemma 4.4. Let ˜µ be deﬁned as in (4.11). Then µ ∈ (0, ˜µ), implies N0 = ∅.
Proof. Suppose not. Then there exists w ∈ N0 such that w 6= 0 and

(1 − q)kwk2 − (2∗ − q − 1)|w|2∗

L2∗ (Ω) = 0.

Lemma 4.5. Let ˜µ be deﬁned as in (4.11) and µ ∈ (0, ˜µ). Given u ∈ N , there exists
ρu > 0 and a diﬀerential function gρu : Bρu(0) → R+ satisfying the following:

gρu(0) = 1,

(cid:0)gρu (w)(cid:1)(u + w) ∈ N ∀ w ∈ Bρu(0),

L2∗ (Ω) − µ|u + w|q+1

Lq+1(Ω).

Proof. Deﬁne F : R+ × X0 → R as follows:

We note that u ∈ N implies
and

F (1, 0) = 0,

∂F
∂t

(1, 0) = (1 − q)kuk2 − (2∗ − q − 1)|u|2∗

L2∗ (Ω) 6= 0.

Therefore, by Implicit function theorem, there exists neighbourhood Bρu(0) for some ρu > 0
and a C 1 function gρu : Bρu(0) → R+ such that

(i) gρu (0) = 1,

(ii) F (gρu (w), w) = 0, ∀ w ∈ Bρu(0),

(iii)Ft(gρu (w), w) 6= 0, ∀ w ∈ Bρu(0),

(iv) (cid:10)g′

ρu (0), φ(cid:11) = −(cid:10) ∂F

∂w (1, 0), φ(cid:11)

∂F
∂t (1, 0)

.

Multiplying (ii) by (gρu (w))q+1, it follows that (gρu (w))(u + w) ∈ N . In fact, simplifying
(iii), we obtain

(1 − q)(gρu (w))2||u + w||2 − (2∗ − q − 1)(gρu (w))2∗|u + w|2∗

2∗ 6= 0 ∀ w ∈ Bρu(0).

Thus (cid:0)gρu (w)(cid:1)(u + w) ∈ N − ∪ N + for every w ∈ Bρu(0). The last assertion of the lemma

follows from (iv).

µ(un), un(cid:11) = 0,

Since un ∈ N −

such that

gn(0) = 1,

(cid:0)gn(w)(cid:1)(un + w) ∈ N ∀ w ∈ Bρn(0).

(4.28)
Choose 0 < ˜ρn < ρn such that ˜ρn → 0. Let v ∈ X0 with ||v|| = 1. Deﬁne vn :=
˜ρnv ∈ Bρn(0). By taking w = −vn in (4.28), we get (cid:0)gn(−vn)(cid:1)(un − vn) ∈ N . We deﬁne

Proof. By the deﬁnition of ˜α−
µ = infu∈N − Jµ(u) = Jµ(w1) = Iµ(w1). In the
last equality we have used the fact that w1 > 0. Deﬁne g(s) := Iµ(sw1). From the proof
of Lemma 4.3, it follows that there exists only two critical points of g, namely t+(w1) and
t−(w1) and maxs>0 g(s) = g(t+(w1)). On the other hand hI ′
µ(w1), vi = 0 for every v ∈ X0.
Therefore g′(1) = 0. This in turn implies either t+(w1) = 1 or t−(w1) = 1.
Claim: t−(w1) 6= 1.
To see this, we note that t−(w1) = 1 implies t−(w1)w1 ∈ N − as w1 ∈ N −. Also, from
Lemma 4.3, we know t−(w1)w1 ∈ N +. Thus N + ∩ N − 6= ∅, which is a contradiction.
Hence the claim follows.
Therefore t+(w1) = 1 and this completes the proof.

as |n| → ∞. Therefore supa≥0, b∈R Iµ(aw1 − buε) exists and supremum will be attained
in a2 + b2 ≤ R2, for some large R > 0. Thus it is enough to estimate Iµ(aw1 − buε) in

Then w1, uε ∈ X0 implies (w1−ruε) ∈ X0 and (w1−ruε)+ 6≡ 0. Otherwise, (w1−ruε)+ ≡ 0
would imply ¯r2 ≤ r, which is not possible. Deﬁne vr := w1 − ruε. Then 0 6≡ v+
r ∈ X0
(since for any u ∈ X0, we have |u| ∈ X0). Similarly, 0 6≡ v−
r ∈ X0. Therefore, by lemma
r ) ∈ N −. Let
4.3 there exists 0 < s+(r) < s−(r) such that s+(r)v+
us consider the functions s± : R → (0,∞) deﬁned as above.
Claim: The functions r 7→ s±(r) are continuous and
lim
r→¯r−2
where the function t+ is same as deﬁned in lemma 4.3.
To see the claim, choose r0 ∈ (¯r1, ¯r2) and {rn}n≥1 ⊂ (¯r1, ¯r2) such that rn → r0 as n → ∞.
We need to show that s+(rn) → s+(r0) as n → ∞. Corresponding to rn and r0, we have
r0 = (w1 − r0uε)+. By lemma 4.3. we note that s+(r) = t+(v+
rn = (w1 − rnuε)+ and v+
v+
r ).
Let us deﬁne the function

r ∈ N −, and −s−(r)(v−

rn → v+

is deﬁned similar to (4.12) (see Lemma 4.3). Doing the similar calculation as in lemma
4.3, we obtain that for any ﬁxed r, the function F (s, r) has only two zeros s = t+(v+
r ) and
s = t−(v+
r ) (see (4.16)). Consequently s+(r) is the largest 0 of F (s, r) for any ﬁxed r. As
rn → r0 we have v+
r0 in X0 . Indeed, by straight forward computation it follows
vrn → vr0 in X0. Therefore |vrn| → |vr0| in X0. This in turn implies v+
r0 in X0. Hence
rn||X0 → ||v+
||v+
r0|L2∗ (Ω) and
rn|Lq+1(Ω) → |v+
|v+
r0|Lq+1(Ω). As a result, we have F (s, rn) → F (s, r0) uniformly. Therefore
an elementary analysis yields s+(rn) → s+(r0).
Moreover, ¯r2 ≥ w1
2 implies (w1 −
ruε)+ → 0 pointwise. Moreover, since |(w1 − ruε)+|L∞(Ω) ≤ |w1|L∞(Ω), using dominated
convergence theorem we have |(w1 − ruε)+|L2∗ (Ω) → 0. From the analysis in Lemma 4.3,

implies w1 − ¯r2uε ≤ 0. As a consequence r → ¯r−

r0||X0 . Moreover by Sobolev inequality, we have |v+

Proof of Theorem 1.2: Deﬁne µ∗ = min{µ∗, ˜µ, µ0, µ1}. Combining Theorem 4.1 and

Theorem 4.2, we complete the proof of this theorem for µ ∈ (0, µ∗) .

(cid:3)

5. Proof of Theorem 1.3

Before starting the proof we like to remark that when µ ≥ 0, λ > 0, Theorem 1.3 (a)
also follows from [11, Theorem 1]. Here we give a proof which covers the entire range
mentioned in Theorem 1.3.

Proof. (a)We assume µ ∈ R and λ > 0. We prove part (a) using Fountain theorem 2.1.
Energy functional corresponding to (PK ) is deﬁned by I λ
µ (see (1.7)). We need to verify
that I λ
µ satisﬁes (A1)-(A4) of Theorem 2.1. We choose Xj, Yj, Zj as in (2.1) and G := Z/2.
Therefore, (A1) is satisﬁed.

Next to check (A2) holds, we observe that,

I λ
µ (u) ≤

2||u||X0

2 + |µ|

q + 1|u|q+1

Lq+1(Ω) −

λ
p + 1|u|p+1

Lp+1(Ω).

Since on the ﬁnite dimensional space Yk all the norms are equivalent, λ > 0 and 1 < q +1 <
2 < p + 1, it is easy to see that (A2) is satisﬁed if we choose ρk > 0 large enough.

To see (A3) holds, we observe that

I λ

µ (u) ≥ kuk2

Applying H¨older inequality followed by Youngs inequality we obtain

= rk,

Lemma 2.1 yields βk → 0 and hence rk → ∞ as k → ∞. Therefore (A3) is satisﬁed.

In order to verify (A4), let {un} ⊂ X0 such that

µ (un) → c and (I λ
I λ

µ )′(un) → 0 in (X0)′,

where c > 0 and (X0)′ denotes the dual space of X0. Following the same calculation as
in Theorem 1.1, we get {un} is bounded in X0 and there exists u ∈ X0 such that up
to a subsequence un ⇀ u in X0 and un → u in Lr(RN ) for every r ∈ [1, 2∗). Since
µ )′(un), v(cid:11) = 0 for every v in X0, passing the limit using Vitali’s convergence theorem,
(cid:10)(I λ
it follows (cid:10)(I λ
o(1) =D(I λ

µ )′(u), v(cid:11) = 0 for every v in X0. Therefore

− µZΩ
− λZΩ

(|un|q−1un − |u|q−1u)(un − u)dx
(|un|p−1un − |u|p−1u)(un − u)dx.

Again, passing the limit by Vitali, we obtain un → u in X0. Hence, (A4) is satisﬁed. There-
fore by Theorem 2.1, it follows that (PK ) has a sequence of nontrivial solution {wk}k≥1
µ (wk) ≤ ||wk||2
such that I λ
and thus kwkkX0 → ∞ as k → ∞.

µ (wk) → ∞ as k → ∞. Furthermore, if λ > 0, µ ≥ 0, then I λ

(b) This part follows from Theorem 2.2. We can proceed along the same line of proof of
Theorem 1.1 to show (D1)-(D3) of Theorem 2.2 are satisﬁed. To check the assertion (D4),
we consider a sequence {urj} ⊂ X0 such that as
µ )|′
(I λ

I λ
µ (urj ) → c,

{urj} ∈ Yrj ,

(urj ) → 0

rj → ∞.

Yrj

as

We can prove exactly in the same way as in Theorem 1.1 that {un} is a bounded PS
sequence in X0 at level c. Therefore, it is easy to conclude, as in part (a) that un converges
strongly in X0. Hence (D4) is also satisﬁed and as a result by Theorem 2.2, we conclude
(PK ) has a sequence of nontrivial solutions {vk}k≥1 such that ck := I λ
µ (vk) < 0 and ck → 0
as k → ∞. Using (cid:10)(I λ
µ(cid:18)1 −

µ )′(uk), uk(cid:11) = 0 in the deﬁnition of I λ
q + 1(cid:19)ZΩ |u|q+1dx + λ(cid:18)1 −

p + 1(cid:19)ZΩ |u|p+1dx = 2ck < 0.

µ (uk), we have

2

Therefore, if µ > 0, λ ≤ 0, then

0 ≤ −λ(cid:18)1 −

p + 1(cid:19)ZΩ |u|p+1dx = −2ck + µ(cid:18)1 −

2

q + 1(cid:19)ZΩ |u|q+1dx,

24

MOUSOMI BHAKTA, DEBANGANA MUKHERJEE

since 1 < q + 1 < 2 < p + 1. This implies, −2ck ≥ −µ(cid:0)1 − 2
RΩ |uk|q+1dx ≤ −2ckq

µ )′(uk), uk(cid:11) = 0 implies

µ(2−q) . Moreover, (cid:10)(I λ

||uk||2 = µZΩ |uk|q+1dx + λZΩ |uk|p+1dx ≤ µZΩ |uk|q+1dx ≤ −2ckq

2 − q → 0,

q+1(cid:1)RΩ |u|q+1dx. Hence

as k → ∞. This completes the proof.

6. A related variational problem

In this section we consider a related problem that can be solved by doing the similar
type of analysis that we did in Section 3. More precisely we consider the following problem:

u = 0

|x|2s = |u|2∗(t)−2u

|x|t

+ µ|u|q−1u

in RN \ Ω,

where N > 2s, Ω is an open, bounded domain in RN with smooth boundary, 0 ≤ t <
2s, 0 < q < 1, 2∗(t) = 2(N −t)
is the best fractional Hardy constant
on RN . Thanks to the following fractional Hardy inequality :

(6.3)

The following theorem regarding existence of inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions for frac-
tional Hardy-Sobolev type equation can be proved in the spirit of theorem 1.1.

Theorem 6.1. Let Ω be a bounded domain in RN with smooth boundary, N > 2s.Then
there exists µ∗ > 0 such that for all µ ∈ (0, µ∗), problem (6.1) has a sequence of non-
trivial solutions {un}n≥1 such that I(un) < 0 and I(un) → 0 as n → ∞ where I(.) is the
corresponding energy functional associated with (6.1).

In order to prove this theorem one essentially needs to verify an argument similar to

(3.4), where RHS of (3.4) should be replaced by 2s−t
would follow by the similar type of arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

7. Appendix

Lemma 7.1. Let gn be as in (4.27) in the Theorem 4.1 and v ∈ X0 such that ||v|| = 1.
Then there exists µ1 > 0 such that, µ ∈ (0, µ1) implies hg′
n(0), vi is uniformly bounded in
X0.

Proof. In view of lemma 4.5 we have,

Therefore applying H¨older inequality followed by (4.2), we have
|hg′

(1 − q)kunk2 − (2∗ − q − 1)|un|2∗

L2∗ (Ω) = o(1)

as n → ∞.

Hence,

kunk2 =

2∗ − q − 1

1 − q

|un|2∗

Combining the above expression along with the fact that un ∈ N , we obtain

8. Concluding remarks and questions

We ﬁnish the paper with some remarks and related open questions. We have proved

existence of inﬁnitely many nontrivial solutions of the following problem

(( − ∆)su = µ|u|q−1u + |u|p−1u = 0

u = 0

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

2 ( N +2s

where 0 < s < 1, 0 < q < 1 < p ≤ 2∗ − 1, µ > 0, N > 2s and existence of at least one sign
changing solution when p = 2∗ − 1, 1
N −2s ) < q < 1 and N > 6s. Also it is known (see
[5, 6, 10, 14]) that there exists µ0 > 0 such that, for every µ ∈ (0, µ0), the above problem
admits at least two positive solutions. An interesting question here is, can we say anything
about exact number of positive solutions at least in some bounded domain, for example in
the unit ball in RN ? This fact is known in the case of local operator (see [1, 17, 22, 29]).
Answer to this question can shed some light on the multiplicity questions of sign-changing
solutions.
