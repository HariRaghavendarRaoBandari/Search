LINEAR STRUCTURE OF LIPSCHITZ-FREE SPACES OVER COUNTABLE

COMPACT METRIC SPACES

COLIN PETITJEAN

Abstract. In this paper we show that the Lipschitz-free space over a countable compact
metric space linearly embeds into a l1-sum of ﬁnite dimensional subspaces of itself. Therefore,
as a corollary, we will obtain that the Lipschitz-free space over a countable compact metric
space has the 1-Schur property and the 1-strong Schur property.

1. Introduction

Let (M, d) be a pointed metric space and let 0 be its distinguished point. Consider Lip0(M)
the set of all real valued Lispchitz function f deﬁned on M and verifying f (0) = 0. This space
equipped with the norm

kf kL := sup(cid:26)|f (x) − f (y)|

d(x, y)

; x 6= y ∈ M(cid:27)

is a Banach space (we refer to [17] for the study of this space). For x ∈ M, deﬁne the evaluation
functionnal δx ∈ Lip0(M)∗ by δx(f ) = f (x) for every f ∈ Lip0(M). It is not diﬃcult to see that
F (M) := span {δx ; x ∈ M}
is a predual of Lip0(M). This last space is called the Lispchitz-
free space over M, we will refer to it as the free space over M for convenience. This terminology
is due to Godefroy and Kalton, it ﬁrst appeared in [5]. We refer to this last paper for basic
properties of free spaces. However, this space was studied before, for example in [17] where
Weaver called it the Arens-Eels space over M.

A fundamental property of free spaces is that every Lipschitz map between two metric spaces
L: M1 → M2 admits a linearization ˆL: F (M1) → F (M2) such that k ˆLk = Lip(L) (Lip(L)
being the Lipschitz constant of L) and such that the following diagram commutes:

where δi is a isometry deﬁned by δi: x ∈ Mi 7→ δi(x) ∈ F (M2). This property permits in a
particular way to transform a Lipschitz problem into a linear problem. Thus, although free
spaces are easy to deﬁne, their structure is diﬃcult to analyse. For example we know that
F (N) ≡ l1(N) and F (R) ≡ L1(R). But the structure of F (R2) is poorly understood. We know
that F (R2) does not embed linearly into L1 (see [16]), F (R2) has the metric approximation
property (see [5]), and F (R2) is weakly sequentially complete (i.e weakly Cauchy sequence are
weakly convergent). More generally C´uth, Doucha and Wojtaszczyk proved in [2] that F (M) is

weakly sequentially complete for every M ⊆ Rn, and it is also proved in the same paper that the
free space over any inﬁnite metric space admit a complemented subspace linearly isomorphic
to ℓ1.

Free spaces are related to old open problems. An important question in non linear classi-
ﬁcation of Banach spaces is to determine whether a Lispchitz equivalence between separable
Banach spaces implies that these two spaces are linearly isomorphic. For example we do not
know if a separable Banach space that is Lispchitz isomorphic to ℓ1 is also linearly isomorphic
to ℓ1. In order to provide a positive answer to that question, it is suﬃcient to prove that F (ℓ1)
is complemented in its bidual. Another classical example is the following question (see the re-
mark after Proposition 4.4 in [13]): Does the free space over a uniformly discrete metric space
have the bounded approximation property ? A negative answer would provide an equivalent
norm on ℓ1 that fails the metric approximation property, and thus would solve a 50-years old
problem.

It should now be clear for the reader that exploring the structure of free spaces is a big
challenge. Here is a list (absolutely non exhaustive) of recent results, some of which will
further interest us. In [3], A. Dalet proved that the free space over a countable proper metric
space (i.e every closed ball is compact) is a dual space with the metric approximation property.
In [4] Godard characterizes free spaces that are linearly isometric to a subspace of an L1-space
as free spaces over a subset of an R-tree. Finally, in [8] H´ajek, Lancien and Perneck´a proved
that the free space over a proper countable metric space has the Schur property. In this note
we shall improve this last result.

2. Quantitatives Schur properties on Lipschitz-free spaces over countable

compact metric spaces

In the following, we will only consider real Banach spaces. For completeness, we recall here

the deﬁnition of the Schur property and a characterization.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let X be a Banach space. We say that X has the Schur property if every
weakly null sequence (xn)n∈N in X is also k · k-convergent to 0.

Using Rosenthal’s ℓ1 theorem (see Theorem 10.2.1 page 252 in [1] for example), it is not

diﬃcult to prove the following characterization:

Proposition 2.2. A Banach space X has the Schur property if and only if for every δ > 0,
every δ-separated sequence (xn)n∈N in the unit ball of X contains a subsequence that is equivalent
to the unit vector basis of ℓ1, that is there exists a constant K > 0 (which may depend on the
sequence considered) and a subsequence (xnk)k∈N such that

i=1 ∈ Rn.

Xi=1

|ai| ≥ (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

aixni(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

In this case, we say that the sequence (xnk)k∈N is K-equivalent to the unit vector basis of ℓ1.

We will now deﬁne two quantitative versions of the Schur property. The ﬁrst one is called
the strong Schur property, it has been introduced for the ﬁrst time by Johnson and Odell in
[9]. We also refer to [6] for the 1-strong Schur property.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let X be a Banach space.

(1) We say that X has the strong Schur property if there exists a constant K > 0 such
that, for every δ > 0, any δ-separated sequence (xn)n∈N in the unit ball of X contains
a subsequence that is K

δ -equivalent to the unit vector basis of ℓ1.

(2) We say that X has the 1-strong Schur property if for every δ > 0 and every ε > 0, any
δ + ε)-

normalized δ-separated sequence (xn)n∈N in X contains a subsequence that is ( 2
equivalent to the unit vector basis of ℓ1.

It is clear with the previous characterization that the stong Schur property implies the Schur
property. And the Schur property is strictly weaker than the strong Schur property (see [18]
or [10] for exemple).

We refer to [12] (proposition 2.1) for some equivalent formulations of the strong Schur prop-

erty.
Exemple 2.4.

(1) In [14] (Proposition 4.1), Knaust and Odell proved that if X has the property (S) and
does not contain any ismorphic copy of ℓ1, then X ∗ has the strong Schur property. In
particular ℓ1 and all its subspaces have the strong Schur property. A Banach space
has the property (S) if every normalized weakly null sequence contains a subsequence
equivalent to the unit vector basis of c0, this is equivalent to the hereditary Dunford-
Pettis property. We recall that a Banach space X has the Dunford-Pettis property
if every continuous weakly compact operator from X into another Banach space Y
transforms weakly compact sets in X into norm-compact sets in Y . And X has the
hereditary Dunford-Pettis if all its closed subspaces has the Dunford-Pettis property.

(2) In [6] (Lemma 3.4), Godefroy, Kalton and Li proved that a subspace of L1 has the
strong Schur property if and only if its unit ball is relatively compact in the topology
of convergence in measure.

Before giving the second quantitative version of the Schur property, we need two moduli

deﬁned on sequences in a Banach space.

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let X be a Banach space, and let (xn)n∈N be a bounded sequence in X. We
write clustX ∗∗(xn) for the set of all w∗ cluster points of (xn)n∈N in X ∗∗. Then we deﬁne the two
following moduli:

(1) δ(xn) := diam{clustX ∗∗(xn)}.
(2) ca(xn) := inf
n∈N

diam{xk ; k ≥ n}.

The ﬁrst moduli measure how far is the sequence from being weakly Cauchy and the second

one measures how far is the sequence from being k · k-Cauchy.

We can now state the second quantitative version of the Schur property which has been

introduced by Kalenda and Spurn´y in [10] more recently than the previous version.

Deﬁnition 2.6. Let X be a Banach space and let C > 0 be a constant. We say that X has
the C-Schur property if for every bounded sequence (xn)n∈N in X:

ca(xn) ≤ C δ(xn)

In [10] the authors proved that the 1-Schur property implies the 1-strong Schur property, and
that the 1-strong Schur property implies the 5-Schur property. To the best of our knowledge,
the question whether the 1-strong Schur property implies the 1-Schur property is open.

We now state the main result of this paper:

Proposition 2.7. Let (M, d) be a pointed countable proper metric space, i.e every closed ball
of M is compact. Then for any ε > 0, there exists a sequence (En)n of ﬁnite-dimensional
subspaces of F (M) such that F (M) is (1 + ε)-isomorphic to a subspace E of (⊕nEn)ℓ1. Since a
countable compact metric space is in particular a countable proper metric space, the same result
holds for the free space over a countable compact metric space.

Proof. The ﬁrst ingredient is a lemma of Godefroy, Kalton and Li (Lemma 3.1 in [6]):

Lemma 2.8. Let V be a subspace of c0(N) with the metric approximation property (some-
times denoted MAP). Then for any ε > 0, there exists a sequence (En)n of ﬁnite-dimensional
subspaces of V ∗ and a w∗ to w∗ continuous linear map T : V ∗ → (⊕nEn)ℓ1 such that for all
x∗ ∈ V ∗

(1 − ε)kx∗k ≤ kT x∗k ≤ (1 + ε)kx∗k.

A. Dalet has proved in [3] (Theorem 2.6, Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 3.5) that if M is a count-
able proper metric space, then there exists a subspace S0(M) ⊂ Lip0(M) such that S0(M)∗ is
linearly isometric to F (M), and S0(M)∗ has the metric approximation property. Moreover, for
any ε > 0, the space S0(M) is (1 + ε)-isomorphic to a subspace Z of c0(N). First remark that
S0(M) has MAP because this property passes to predual (see [7] or [15]). Then note that Z
has also the metric approximation property so that we can apply the previous lemma 2.8 to
Z. Indeed Z ∗ is (1 + ε)-isomorphic to F (M), so Z ∗ has the (1 + ε)-bounded approximation
property. Next, we get that Z has MAP from another theorem of Grothendieck (see again [7]
or Theorem 1.e.15 in [15]): a separable dual space which has the λ-BAP for some λ ≥ 1 also
has the metric approximation property. Consequently Z ∗ has MAP and thus Z has also MAP.

Let us consider (M, d) a pointed countable proper metric space and let us take ε > 0 arbitrary.

Fix ε′ such that (1 + ε′)3 < 1 + ε. Using the previous results we obtain that

• There exists a subspace Z of c0(N) such that S0(M) is (1 + ε′)-isomorphic to Z.
• There exists a sequence (Fn)n of ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces of Z ∗ such that Z ∗ is

(1 + ε′)-isomorphic to a subspace F of (⊕nFn)ℓ1.

Now F (M) is (1 + ε′)-isomorphic to Z ∗ so there exists a sequence (En)n of ﬁnite-dimensional
subspaces of F (M) such that each (⊕nEn)ℓ1 is (1 + ε′)-isomorphic to (⊕nFn)ℓ1. Then there
exists E subspace of (⊕nEn)ℓ1 which is (1 + ε′)-isomorphic to F . It is easy to check that F (M)
is (1 + ε′)3-isomorphic to E, this completes the proof.
(cid:3)

Corollary 2.9. Let (M, d) be a pointed countable proper metric space, Then F (M) has the 1-
Schur property (and thus also the 1-strong Schur property). In particular, if (K, d) is a pointed
countable compact metric space, then F (K) has the 1-Schur property.

Proof. We consider the same notation that we used in the previous proof. Since every En is of
ﬁnite dimension, we can adapt the proof of the fact that ℓ1 is 1-Schur in [10] (Theorem 3.1) in

LINEAR STRUCTURE OF LIPSCHITZ-FREE SPACES OVER COUNTABLE COMPACT METRIC SPACES 5

order to obtain that (⊕nEn)ℓ1 is 1-Schur. The 1-Schur property is stable passing to subspaces,
so the subspace E has the 1-Schur property. We easily deduce from the fact that F (M) is
(1 + ε)-isomorphic to E that F (M) has the (1 + ε)-Schur property.

To summarize, we proved that for every ε > 0, F (M) has the (1 + ε)-Schur property. It is
straightfoward to check that this implies that F (M) has the 1-Schur property and thus also
has the 1-strong Schur property (since 1-Schur implies 1-strong Schur).
(cid:3)

Remark 2.10. In [11] it is proved (Theorem 1.1) that if X is a subspace of c0(Γ), then X ∗ has
the 1-Schur property. So one can use this last result to prove Corollary 2.9. But Lemma 2.8
gives more information on subspaces of c0 with MAP.
