ABSTRACT

We present high speed photometry and high resolution spectroscopy of the eclipsing post
common envelope binary QS Virginis (QS Vir). Our UVES spectra span multiple orbits over
more than a year and reveal the presence of several large prominences passing in front of
both the M star and its white dwarf companion, allowing us to triangulate their positions.
Despite showing small variations on a timescale of days, they persist for more than a year and
may last decades. One large prominence extends almost three stellar radii from the M star.
Roche tomography reveals that the M star is heavily spotted and that these spots are long-
lived and in relatively ﬁxed locations, preferentially found on the hemisphere facing the white
dwarf. We also determine precise binary and physical parameters for the system. We ﬁnd that
the 14, 220 ± 350 K white dwarf is relatively massive, 0.782 ± 0.013M⊙, and has a radius of
0.01068 ± 0.00007R⊙, consistent with evolutionary models. The tidally distorted M star has a
mass of 0.382 ± 0.006M⊙ and a radius of 0.381 ± 0.003R⊙, also consistent with evolutionary
models. We ﬁnd that the magnesium absorption line from the white dwarf is broader than
expected. This could be due to rotation (implying a spin period of only ∼700 seconds), or
due to a weak (∼100kG) magnetic ﬁeld, we favour the latter interpretation. Since the M star’s
radius is still within its Roche lobe and there is no evidence that its over-inﬂated we conclude
that QS Vir is most likely a pre-cataclysmic binary just about to become semi-detached.

1 INTRODUCTION

Close binaries containing a white dwarf and a low-mass M star are
survivors of a common envelope phase of evolution during which
both stars orbited within a single envelope of material ejected by
the progenitor of the white dwarf. These systems slowly lose an-
gular momentum via gravitational radiation and (if the M star
is massive enough) magnetic braking, eventually becoming semi-
detached cataclysmic variable (CV) systems.

In recent years the number of such systems known has

dramatically increased,
thanks mainly to the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al. 2000; Adelman-McCarthy et al.
2008; Abazajian et al. 2009), which has lead to the discovery
of more than 2000 white dwarf plus main-sequence systems
(Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2013a), from which more than 200
close, post common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) have been identi-
ﬁed (Nebot Gómez-Morán et al. 2011; Parsons et al. 2013b, 2015).
Among this sample are 71 eclipsing binaries (see the appendix of
Parsons et al. 2015 for a recent census). These are extremely useful
systems for high precision stellar parameter studies, since the small
size of the white dwarf leads to very sharp eclipse proﬁles, allow-
ing radius measurements to a precision of better than two per cent

(e.g. Parsons et al. 2010a), good enough to test models of stellar
and binary evolution.

The main-sequence star components in PCEBs are tidally
locked to the white dwarf and hence are rapidly rotating. This rapid
rotation results in very active stars. Indeed, it appears as though
virtually every PCEB hosts an active main-sequence star, regard-
less of its spectral type (Rebassa-Mansergas et al. 2013b). Even
extremely old systems still show signs of activity (Parsons et al.
2012b), manifesting as starspots and ﬂaring. These features allow
us to constrain the conﬁguration of the underlying magnetic ﬁeld
of the main-sequence star, crucial for understanding the evolution
of these binaries, since the magnetic ﬁeld is able to remove angular
momentum from the system, driving the two stars closer together
(Rappaport et al. 1983; Kawaler 1988).

Discovered as an eclipsing PCEB by O’Donoghue et al.
(2003), QS Vir (EC 13471−1258) has been intensely studied
since it shows signs of being both a standard pre-CV, de-
tached white dwarf plus main-sequence binary (Ribeiro et al. 2010;
Parsons et al. 2011), as well as indications of accretion of material
on to the white dwarf well above standard rates for detached sys-
tems (Matranga et al. 2012); the M star is also very close to ﬁlling
its Roche lobe, leading to the initial interpretation that it could in
fact be a hibernating CV that has recently detached due to a nova
eruption (O’Donoghue et al. 2003). Furthermore, the arrival times
of its eclipse show substantial variations (Parsons et al. 2010b),
which some authors have claimed may be due to the gravitational
effects of circumbinary planets (Almeida & Jablonski 2011), al-
though the proposed orbital conﬁguration has recently been shown
to be highly unstable (Horner et al. 2013), meaning that the true
origin of these variations remains unexplained.

The M star in QS Vir is very active, indicated both by evidence
of substantial ﬂaring (Parsons et al. 2010b), as well as intriguing
narrow absorption features detected in high resolution spectra by
Parsons et al. (2011). This absorption was found to be due to mate-
rial expelled from the M star passing in front of the white dwarf. In
this paper we investigate the behaviour of the material lost by the
M star and its motion within the binary over a time span of more
than a year as well as performing Roche tomography to identify and
track starspots on the surface of the M star. We also place stringent
constraints on the stellar and binary parameters.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND THEIR REDUCTION

In this section we outline our observations and their reduction. A
full log of all our observations is given in Table 1.

2.1 ULTRACAM photometry

QS Vir has been observed many times with the high speed frame-
transfer camera ULTRACAM (Dhillon et al. 2007). These obser-
vations date back to 2002 and were obtained with ULTRACAM
mounted as a visitor instrument on the 4.2-m William Herschel
Telescope (WHT) on La Palma and the 3.5-m New Technology
Telescope (NTT) on La Silla. Much of these data were presented
in Parsons et al. (2010b), however, we detail both the older data
and our new data in Table 1. ULTRACAM uses a triple beam setup
allowing one to obtain data in the u′, g′ and either r′ or i′ band
simultaneously.

All of these data were reduced using the ULTRACAM
pipeline software. Debiassing, ﬂatﬁelding and sky background sub-
traction were performed in the standard way. The source ﬂux was
determined with aperture photometry using a variable aperture,
whereby the radius of the aperture is scaled according to the full
width at half maximum (FWHM). Variations in observing condi-
tions were accounted for by determining the ﬂux relative to a com-
parison star in the ﬁeld of view. The data were ﬂux calibrated using
observations of standard stars observed during twilight.

2.2 UVES spectroscopy

We observed QS Vir with the high resolution Echelle spectrograph
UVES (Dekker et al. 2000) installed at the European Southern Ob-
servatory Very Large Telescope (ESO VLT) 8.2-m telescope unit on
Cerro Paranal. We used the dichroic 2 setup allowing us to cover
3760Å–4990Å in the blue arm and 5690Å–9460Å in the red arm,
with a small gap between 7520Å and 7660Å and 2x2 binning in
both arms. We used exposure times of 3 minutes in order to reduce
the effects of orbital smearing, this gives a signal-to-noise ratio in
the continuum ranging from ∼15 at the shortest wavelengths to
∼ 40 at longer wavelengths.

Our data consist of two separate observing runs. The ﬁrst, in
2013, was conducted in visitor mode over two nights. On each night
we covered well over a full orbital period. During this run we also

of the white dwarf. However, only a single spectrum was avail-
able, limiting the constraints that could be placed on its location
and size. Our new data cover the full binary orbit and hence much
tighter constraints can be placed. Moreover, our data cover mul-
tiple orbits over a timescale of more than a year, allowing us to
investigate the evolution of these features. Figure 2 shows trailed
spectrograms of the Ca II 3934Å line on 6 separate nights, cover-
ing timescales from a day to a year. Strong emission from the M
star is visible resulting from a combination of activity and irradi-
ation (note how the emission is strongest at phase 0.5, when the
irradiated face points towards us). There are additional short-lived
localised emission components from the M star labelled “A” in Fig-
ure 2, best seen in the 5th of May 2013 data (middle-top panel of
Figure 2). These narrow emission features occur on top of the in-
trinsic emission from the M star and only persist for single orbits,
they are likely related to ﬂares on its surface. There is also a narrow
non-variable, zero velocity absorption component likely the result
of interstellar absorption.

In addition to emission from the M star, there is also a narrow
absorption line moving in anti-phase to the M star, but only visi-
ble at certain orbital phases. This absorption is seen just before and
after the eclipse of the white dwarf (labelled “B” in Figure 2, partic-
ularly clear in the 2013 data) as well as close to phase 0.25, labelled
“C”. When visible, these absorption features have the same veloc-
ity as the white dwarf (see Section 3.3), implying that this material
blocking the light of the white dwarf has no radial velocity relative
to it, and suggests that it is in a state of solid-body rotation with
respect to the binary, likely in the form of prominences.

The most striking aspect of Figure 2 is that these prominence
features appear to persist on timescales of days, weeks, months and
years. Given the similarity of the prominence feature detected at on
orbital phase of 0.16 in the 2002 spectra by Parsons et al. (2011),
it also appears that these features could be stable on timescales of
decades. However, Figure 2 also shows that they are not completely
ﬁxed. The absorption feature around phase 0.25 is visible for longer
during 2014 compared to the 2013 data. Meanwhile the absorption
around the eclipse is much clearer in the 2013 data and is only
obvious before the eclipse in the 2014 dataset.

In Figure 3 we show the same plots as Figure 2 but for the Hα
line. This line shows a much more complex behaviour, with mul-
tiple absorption and emission components visible. The strongest
component is still the emission from the M star, but narrow absorp-
tion components are seen crossing this emission throughout the or-
bit during all six observations (the strongest are labelled “D” in
Figure 3). The prominence material passing in front of the white
dwarf is still visible (“C”), albeit slightly weaker than in the Ca II
line since the white dwarf contributes a smaller amount of the over-
all ﬂux at Hα. Furthermore, there are several additional emission
components which do not correspond to either star in the binary,
labelled “E”. The Hα line also shows considerable variability in
the strength of all these features from night-to-night compared to
the Ca II line.

In Figure 4 we show a larger version of the Ca II and Hα
trailed spectrogram from the second observing run (5th of May
2013) with some of the major features labelled. The radial velocity
of the white dwarf and M star are shown as red lines (see Sec-
tion 3.3 and 3.4). We highlight in blue three clear prominence-like
absorption features visible in all six observations, that appear to
cross one or both of the stars. In addition we highlight three ad-
ditional emission components visible in the Hα trail that do not
originate from either star.

To further highlight the various emission components visible

observed several M star spectral type standards covering the range
M3.0 to M4.5. The second run comprised of a series of four ser-
vice mode observations made over a month roughly a year after
our visitor mode observations. Each of these observations covered
just over an orbital period.

All the data were reduced using the most recent release of the
UVES data reduction pipeline (version 5.3.0). The standard recipes
were used to optimally extract each spectrum. We used observa-
tions of the featureless DC white dwarf LHS 2333 to ﬂux calibrate
and telluric correct our spectra.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Spectrum

The spectrum of QS Vir was ﬁrst described by O’Donoghue et al.
(2003). Ribeiro et al. (2010) and Parsons et al. (2011) also pre-
sented higher resolution spectra. Both components of the binary are
clearly visible in the spectrum, with the Balmer lines of the white
dwarf the dominant features at wavelengths less than ∼5000Å and
the molecular absorption features of the M star the dominant fea-
tures at longer wavelengths. There are also several emission lines
originating from the M star throughout the spectrum caused by a
combination of activity and irradiation from the white dwarf. As
noted by Parsons et al. (2011) there is also a weak Mg II 4481Å
absorption line from the white dwarf.

In addition to these general features, we also re-detect the nar-
row absorption features noted by Parsons et al. (2011) in the hydro-
gen Balmer series and calcium H and K lines, an example of this is
shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, we also detect absorption features
in several other species including the sodium D lines and several
Mg I and Fe II lines. The behaviour and origin of these features are
discussed in the following section.

3.2 Prominence features

The sharp absorption features detected by Parsons et al. (2011)
were attributed to a prominence from the M star passing in front

Figure 2. Phase-folded trailed spectrograms of the Ca II 3934Å line, data shown twice for visual continuity. The date at the start of the night the data were
obtained is shown above each plot. Higher ﬂuxes are darker. The main features visible are the emission from the active M star and the eclipse of the white
dwarf. However, a narrow absorption feature is visible just before and after the eclipse (“B”) and at phase 0.25 (“C”) in all the plots. This is caused by material
moving in front of the white dwarf and, although variable, is always visible, despite the data spanning more than a year.

in the trailed spectrogram of the Hα line we used Doppler tomog-
raphy (Marsh & Horne 1988). We used the MODMAP code de-
scribed in Steeghs (2003) to reconstruct the Doppler map shown in
Figure 5, using all the data from May 5th 2013. It clearly shows
that the strongest emission component originates from the M star
itself, but the three additional emission components visible in the
trailed spectrogram are seen more clearly, with two close to the
white dwarf’s Roche lobe and one high velocity emission compo-
nent. These components are labelled “A”, “B” and “C” and corre-

spond to the additional emission seen in the Hα trail in Figure 4,
where we have used the same labels to highlight the features.

The clearest prominence feature in Figure 4, labelled “1”, is
responsible for the narrow absorption line seen at around phase
0.25 in the Ca II line, when it passes in front of the white dwarf.
At around phase 0.4 this same material passes in front of the M
star, completely blocking the Hα emission component from this
star. Furthermore, this prominence is seen in emission at certain or-
bital phases, highlighted as component “C” in both Figure 4 and
Figure 5. It is possible that the prominence is dense enough that it

and the date at the start of the night the data were obtained is shown above each plot. Higher ﬂuxes are darker. The strongest component is emission from the
active M star. However, there are at least two other emission components (“E”), neither of which originate from either of the stars. Material is seen moving
across the face of both the white dwarf (“C”) and M star (“D”). Despite being separated by more than a year, the trails look remarkably similar.

is able to reprocess the light it receives from the white dwarf. Alter-
natively, this could be intrinsic emission from the prominence. Fig-
ure 3 shows that the strength of this emission clearly varied from
2013 to 2014, weakening in 2014.

The fact that this prominence crosses in front of both stars al-
lows us to triangulate its position within the binary. Figure 6 shows
a visualisation of the binary indicating both the location and size of
this prominence. We show this for both 2013 and 2014, variations
on shorter timescales are minimal. As is evident from Figures 2 and
3 the prominence is larger in 2014, clearly taking longer to pass in

front of the white dwarf. We also show the viewing angle to the
white dwarf in the 2002 data from Parsons et al. (2011) which also
passed through a similar prominence feature.

The stability and longevity of this feature is remarkable, given
that it is located at an unstable location within the binary and hence
the material should be expelled quickly. In Figure 6 we plot the ef-
fective “co-rotation” radius of the binary. While this radius is well
deﬁned for a single star (the radius at which the gravitational attrac-
tion equals the centripetal acceleration of a particle in solid-body
rotation with the star, hence a particle can sit there with no other

trail). We also highlight three other emission components in the Hα trail with dark red lines.

force needed to hold it), such a radius does not exist for a binary.
In this case the centripetal acceleration acts towards the centre of
mass, but the gravitational forces act towards the two stars and so
there is not a stable radius, but rather ﬁve equilibrium points (the
Lagrangian points). However, in Figure 6 we slightly extend the
deﬁnition by considering the radial component of acceleration in
the rotating frame (automatically including gravity and centripetal
terms) as measured from the centre of mass of the M star, result-
ing in a line that passes through the Lagrangian points. Neverthe-
less, except for at the Lagrangian points themselves, there are still
forces acting perpendicular to this line, so it does not represent a
stable region within the binary, hence some additional force is re-
quired to keep material in this region. However, it may well be eas-
ier for material to stay ﬁxed near this line than at other locations.
From Figure 6 it is evident that material is located at this radius, but
also extends substantially beyond it, requiring that quite signiﬁcant
non-gravitational forces are acting upon it (presumably some sort
of magnetic force).

The feature labelled “2” in Figure 4 crosses the M star at an
orbital phase of ∼0.75, but does not appear to pass in front of the
white dwarf (hence it is not visible in the Ca II trail), meaning that
we cannot completely determine its location or size like the large
prominence. It is possible that it passes in front of the white dwarf
shortly before or during the eclipse, in which case it would be lo-

cated close to the surface of the M star. Or instead, this particular
prominence could be at an inclination such that it only passes in
front of the M star. This prominence weakened considerably be-
tween 2013 and 2014 and is barely visible in the last observations
in Figure 3. There does not appear to be an obvious emission com-
ponent associated with this prominence.

The feature labelled “3” in Figure 4 crosses the face of the M
star during the eclipse of the white dwarf, and therefore this ma-
terial must be located behind the M star, from the white dwarf’s
perspective. Moreover, the Ca II trail shows that this material also
passes in front of the white dwarf just before and after the eclipse.
Unfortunately, this means that we cannot determine the exact lo-
cation of this material either. This prominence is seen in emission
as a high velocity component blueward of the M star at phase 0.75
(labelled “A”) in the Hα trail (dot-dashed line) and more clearly at
(-650,450) in Figure 5. Similar absorption features were detected in
ultraviolet spectra of V471 Tau just before and after the eclipse of
the white dwarf (Guinan et al. 1986), which they attributed to cool
coronal loops. Interestingly, O’Donoghue et al. (2003) detected a
sharp pre-eclipse dip in the light curve of QS Vir (see their Fig-
ure 8) which could be from similar coronal loops, implying that
this material can sometimes be dense enough to block out contin-
uum light. However, the lack of a comparison star during this obser-
vation means that this dip should be interpreted with some caution.

Parsons et al. (2011) in which prominence material was also observed. The

the location of the ﬁve Lagrange points. The outer solid black line indicates
the effective “co-rotation” radius of the binary (see the text for a deﬁnition
of this radius).

stars show similar prominence systems beyond their co-rotation
radii (Donati et al. 1999; Dunstone et al. 2006), and located far
from their equatorial planes (Collier Cameron & Robinson 1989).
Indeed, Jardine et al. (2001) found that for single stars there ex-
ist stable locations both inside and outside the co-rotation radius
and up to 5 stellar radii from the star (Jardine & van Ballegooijen
2005). Long-lived prominences have also been detected in the CVs
BV Cen (Watson et al. 2007), IP Peg and SS Cyg (Steeghs et al.
1996) and AM Her (Gänsicke et al. 1998). Magnetically conﬁned
material was also detected in BB Dor (Schmidtobreick et al. 2012)
and near the L4 and L5 Lagrange points in AM Her (Kafka et al.
2008). In addition, the detached white dwarf plus main-sequence
star binaries V471 Tau (Jensen et al. 1986) and SDSS J1021+1744
(Irawati et al. 2016) both show long-lived prominence-like fea-
tures, in very similar positions to the large prominence in QS Vir.

3.3 White dwarf radial velocity amplitude

We measure the radial velocity amplitude of the white dwarf using
the narrow Mg II 4481Å absorption line. Due to emission from the
M star, the cores of the hydrogen Balmer lines are not visible, thus
making them unsuitable for radial velocity work. No other intrinsic
white dwarf absorption features are detected in the UVES spectra.
We ﬁt the Mg II line in each spectrum with a combination of
a straight line and a Gaussian component. We do not ﬁt the spec-

lobes of the white dwarf and M star are highlighted with a black dashed
line and solid white line respectively. To highlight the additional emission
features against the strong emission from the M star we have also plotted
contours. Three clear emission features that do not originate from either star
are labelled.

Despite our extensive photometric monitoring (e.g. Table 1) this
dip has not been seen since.

Finally, there is another emission component highlighted in
the Hα trail in Figure 4 by a dotted line (labelled “B”). It moves
in anti-phase with the M star, but with a much lower velocity than
the white dwarf, meaning that this must originate from material
between the two stars. It is also visible in Figure 5 close to (0,0),
within the Roche lobe of the white dwarf. Figure 3 shows that this
emission was much stronger in 2014 compared to 2013. Assuming
that this material co-rotates with the binary, its location is given by

a (cid:17) − q,

(1)

= (1 + q)(cid:16) R

Kmat
Ksec
where Kmat and Ksec are the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of
the material and the M star respectively, q is the mass ratio and
R/a is the distance of the material from the white dwarf scaled by
the orbital separation (a).

Using our measured values of Ksec and q (see Sections 4 and
5) and Kmat = −100km s−1determined by Gaussian ﬁtting in
the same way as outlined in the next section, gives R/a = 0.09.
Similar emission features have been seen in other post common-
envelope binaries (Parsons et al. 2013a; Tappert et al. 2011) as
well as CVs (Steeghs et al. 1996; Gänsicke et al. 1998; Kafka et al.
2005, 2006) and could be related to another prominence structure
or heated material from the wind of the M star close to the white
dwarf. Interestingly, there appears to be a genuine deﬁciency of Hα
emission from the inner face of the M star, best seen in Figure 5.
The deﬁciency may be due to this material between the two stars
shielding the M star from irradiation by the white dwarf.

Despite being an eclipsing system, the inclination of QS Vir is
relatively low (i = 77.7◦, see Section 5), therefore, not only are
these prominences far from the M star, they are also located far
from its equatorial plane. However, many cool, isolated low-mass

tra obtained whilst the white dwarf was in eclipse (including the
ingress and egress phases). Furthermore, we do not ﬁt the spec-
tra taken during phases 0.45–0.55, since during these phases Mg II
emission from the heated inner hemisphere of the M star ﬁlls in
the absorption as the two components cross over. The resultant ve-
locity measurements and their corresponding orbital phases were
then ﬁtted with a sinusoid to determine the white dwarf’s radial
velocity semi-amplitude. The result of this is shown in Figure 7.
We ﬁnd a radial velocity semi-amplitude for the white dwarf of
139.0±1.0km s−1, with a mean velocity of 43.2±0.8km s−1, con-
sistent with (but much more precise than) the measurement from
O’Donoghue et al. (2003) (137 ± 10km s−1and 61 ± 10km s−1 re-
spectively) using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra, although
our mean velocity is a little lower than their measured value. The
mean velocity of the white dwarf is redshifted from the systemic
velocity of the binary due to its high gravity, which can be used to
constrain its physical parameters (see Section 5).

3.4 M star radial velocity amplitude

We attempted to measure the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the
M star using the same technique outlined in the last section (i.e.
a Gaussian ﬁt) and ﬁtting the Na I 8200Å absorption doublet. Fig-
ure 8 shows the result of this ﬁt. At ﬁrst glance it seems that the
semi-amplitude is tightly constrained by the data (the average un-
certainty on an individual velocity measurement is ∼1km s−1).
However, as the residuals show, the deviation from a pure sinusoid
are quite pronounced and there are clearly large systematic trends
affecting the velocity measurements. These deviations are seen in
the data from both 2013 and 2014 as well as for other atomic fea-
tures, such as the K I 7665Å and 7699Å lines. Therefore, we do not
consider these measurements a true representation of the centre-of-
mass velocity of the M star.

The most likely cause of this deviation is the presence of
starspots on the surface of the M star, although gravity darken-
ing and irradiation may also contribute to this. Therefore, in or-
der to determine a more reliable value for the radial velocity semi-
amplitude for the M star, as well as a better understanding of the
starspot distribution and evolution, we used our UVES spectra to

blet from the M star using a Gaussian ﬁt from the 2013 observations. The
red line in the top panel is the centre-of-mass radial velocity of the M star
determined from our Roche tomography analysis (see Section 4). Clear de-
viations from this ﬁt are seen in the residuals in the lower panel as a result
of the large number of star spots. The red line in the lower panel shows
the deviations from the centre-of-light to the centre-of-mass radial velocity
as determined from our Roche tomography analysis of the 2013 data, and
show a very similar behaviour to the Gaussian measurements.

perform Roche tomography of the M star, which we detail in the
following section.

4 ROCHE TOMOGRAPHY

Roche tomography is a technique analogous to Doppler imag-
ing (e.g. Vogt & Penrod 1983), and has been successfully used
to image surface features on the secondary stars in interacting
binaries. The technique assumes the secondary star rotates syn-
chronously in a circular orbit around the centre of mass, and uses
phase-resolved spectral line proﬁles to map the line-intensity dis-
tribution across the star’s surface in real space. The method has
been extensively applied to the secondary stars in CVs over the
last 20 years (Rutten & Dhillon 1994, 1996; Watson et al. 2003;
Schwope et al. 2004; Watson et al. 2006, 2007; Hill et al. 2014),
and artefacts arising from systematic errors are well characterised
and understood. For a detailed description of the methodology and
axioms of Roche tomography, we refer the reader to the references
above and the technical reviews by Watson & Dhillon (2001) and
Dhillon & Watson (2001).

4.1 Least squares deconvolution

Spot features appear in absorption line proﬁles as an emission bump
(actually a lack of absorption), and are typically a few per cent of
the line depth. Thus, very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data
are required for surface imaging, a feat not directly achievable
for a single absorption line with QS Vir due to its faintness and
the requirements for short exposures to avoid orbital smearing. To
greatly improve our SNR we employ least squares deconvolution
(LSD), a technique that stacks the thousands of stellar absorption
lines observable in a spectrum to produce a single ‘mean’ proﬁle.
First applied by Donati et al. (1997), the technique has been widely
used since (e.g. Barnes et al. 2004; Shahbaz & Watson 2007). For a

more detailed description of LSD, we refer the reader to the above
references as well as the review by Collier Cameron (2001).

To generate the LSD line proﬁles the continuum must be ﬂat-
tened. However, the contribution of the M star to the total system
luminosity may vary due to variations in accretion luminosity (see
Section 6.3), and the rapid ﬂaring on the M star on timescales of
several minutes (O’Donoghue et al. 2003). Both of these mecha-
nisms may change the continuum slope, and so a master continuum
ﬁt to the data is not appropriate. Furthermore, normalization of the
continuum would result in the photospheric absorption lines from
the secondary varying in relative strength between exposures. This
forces us to subtract the continuum from each spectrum, which was
achieved by ﬁtting a spline to the data.

To produce the LSD proﬁles we generated a line list appro-
priate for a M3.5V star (Teﬀ = 3100K and logg = 4.88) from
the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD3; Kupka et al. 2000),
adopting a detection limit of 0.1. The normalized line depths were
scaled by a ﬁt to the continuum of a M3.5V template star so each
line’s relative depth was correct for use with the continuum sub-
tracted spectra. As the transitions in molecular features (such as
the prominent TiO bands) are difﬁcult to model, the line lists for
these features are of poor quality, and so we were unable to include
spectral regions containing these features in LSD. In addition, we
excluded emission lines and tellurics from the LSD process. Thus,
a total of 46 absorption lines were used, lying in the spectral ranges
8400−8470Å and 8585−8935Å. As QS Vir is an eclipsing binary,
there are signiﬁcant features in the line proﬁles arising between
phases 0.4–0.6 (superior conjunction) which do not originate on
the secondary. As inclusion of these phases would cause artefacts
to appear on the reconstructed maps (e.g. the entire inner hemi-
sphere would appear to be irradiated), they were excluded from the
ﬁtting process. The LSD proﬁles were then binned on a uniform
velocity scale of 7.4km s−1 to match the velocity smearing due to
the orbital motion.

The LSD proﬁles exhibited a clear continuum slope that was
largely removed by subtracting a second-order polynomial ﬁt to
the continuum, preserving the proﬁles’ features and shape. How-
ever, these corrected proﬁles still exhibited a non-ﬂat continuum
which lay signiﬁcantly below zero. To account for this, a constant
offset was added to each set of LSD proﬁles, the speciﬁc value of
which was non-trivial to determine due to degeneracies in the ﬁtting
process; if a small constant was added, a greater proportion of the
line wings lay below the continuum, inﬂating the Roche lobe and
changing the optimum masses found in the ﬁt with Roche tomogra-
phy. If a large constant was added, more of the line wings lay above
the continuum, changing the optimum system parameters. Hence,
an optimum value of constant to add to the LSD proﬁles could not
be found computationally. Instead, the most appropriate offset was
found by visual inspection of the ﬁts to the data. This was done in-
dependently for each data set. These offset and continuum-ﬂattened
LSD proﬁles were then adopted for the rest of the ﬁtting process
with Roche tomography.

In general, Roche tomography cannot normally be performed
on data which has not been corrected for slit losses, due to the sec-
ondary star’s variable light contribution. As the acquired data of
QS Vir was largely photometric, we were able to correct for slit
losses using an optimal-subtraction technique. Here, each LSD pro-
ﬁle was scaled and subtracted from the ﬁt made with Roche tomog-
raphy, where the optimal scaling factor was that which minimized
the residuals. The newly-scaled LSD proﬁles were then re-ﬁt with
Roche tomography, and the above process repeated until the scaling
factors no longer varied. The resulting scaled proﬁles were visually

inspected and found to be consistent. The ﬁnal LSD proﬁles with
computed ﬁts and residuals are shown in Figure 9.

4.2 System parameters

Roche tomography constrains the binary parameters by recon-
structing intensity maps of the stellar surface for many combina-
tions of M1, M2, inclination (i), systemic velocity (γ) and Roche-
lobe ﬁlling factor (RLFF). Each map is ﬁt to the same χ2. However,
for a given value of χ2, many maps may ﬁt the data equally well,
and so the maximum-entropy regularisation statistic is employed
for selecting the reconstructed map with least informational con-
tent required to ﬁt the data (the most positive entropy value). Thus
for any given set of parameters, the reconstructed map has an asso-
ciated entropy. The optimal parameters are determined by selecting
those that produce the map of maximum entropy across all possible
parameter combinations. Adoption of incorrect system parameters
results in the reconstruction of spurious artefacts in the ﬁnal map
(see Watson & Dhillon 2001 for details). Artefacts are well charac-
terised and always increase the amount of structure mapped in the
ﬁnal image, which in turn leads to a decrease in the entropy reg-
ularisation statistic. All data sets were ﬁt independently using this
method.

It was assumed the rotation of the M dwarf is tidally locked to
the orbital period, and so the period was ﬁxed to 0.1507576116 d
(Parsons et al. 2011). Additionally, the inclination was ﬁxed to
i = 77.8◦, as this was well constrained from light-curve analy-
sis – considering the SNR of the data being ﬁt, we are unlikely to
improve the accuracy of this using Roche tomography, and indeed
an unsuccessful attempt was made to constrain inclination once op-
timal system parameters were found.

4.2.1 Limb Darkening

Roche tomography allows limb darkening to be included in the ﬁt-
ting of line proﬁles. In order to calculate the correct limb darkening
coefﬁcients, we determined the effective central wavelength of the
data over ranges speciﬁed in Section 4.1 using,
λcen = Pi
Pi

di λi

σ2
i

,

where di is the line depth at wavelength λi, and σi the error in
the data at λi. The mean value of λcen across the 6 datasets was
used for consistency. We adopted a four-parameter non-linear limb
darkening model (see Claret 2000), given by

I(µ)
I(1)

(3)

where µ = cos γ (γ is the angle between the line of sight and the
emergent ﬂux), and I(1) is the monochromatic speciﬁc intensity at
the centre of the stellar disk.

Using the calculated λcen, the limb darkening coefﬁcients
were then determined by linearly interpolating between the tabu-
lated wavelengths given in Claret (2000). We adopted stellar pa-
rameters closest to that of a M3.5V star, which for the PHOENIX
model atmosphere were log g = 5 and Teﬀ = 3100K. Thus,
the adopted coefﬁcients were a1 = 3.302, a2 = −5.057, a3 =
4.612, a4 = −1.61. We note that the limb darkening law used
is for spherical stars, and so is not ideally suited to the distorted

main-sequence star in QS Vir. Ideally one would need to calcu-
late limb darkening coefﬁcients for each tile in the grid based on
a model atmosphere. However, this is not currently possible within
our code, and so we adopted uniform limb darkening coefﬁcients.

Artefacts arising from adopting incorrect coefﬁcients are discussed
in Watson & Dhillon (2001).

Figure 10. Points show the maximum entropy value obtained in each data
set, as a function of systemic velocity. The optimal masses and RLFF as
found in Section 4.2.3 were adopted for the ﬁts of each data set. The points
are plotted with a vertical offset of 0.1 between data sets. Crosses mark
the value of γ that yields the map of maximum entropy, and a sixth-order
polynomial ﬁt is shown as a visual aid. The mean systemic velocity across
all data is γmean = −4.4+0.5

−0.9 kms−1.

4.2.2 Systemic velocity

The entropy statistic is most sensitive to an incorrect systemic ve-
locity γ, and so this parameter was narrowed down most easily.
Figure 10 shows the map entropy yielded for each data set as
a function of γ, where a cross marks the γ that gives the map
of maximum entropy. The mean value across all data sets yields
γmean = −4.4+0.5
−0.9km s−1, where the uncertainties represent the
spread between maximum and minimum for all measured values.
We also determined the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the M star
as 275.8 ±2.0km s−1. Note that the radial velocity semi-amplitude
of the M star is calculated from the resulting stellar parameters
(masses, inclination etc.) rather than being a direct input to the ﬁt.
As mentioned in Section 3.4 we consider these values more reli-
able than those from Gaussian ﬁtting, due to the surface inhomo-
geneities biasing those results and indeed once these surface fea-
tures are taken into account, the measured velocities match the re-
constructed model from Roche tomography (see the lower panel of
Figure 8).

4.2.3 Roche lobe ﬁlling factor and masses

Readers should note that, unless otherwise stated, the value of the
RLFF is given as the ratio of the volume averaged radius of the M
star to its Roche lobe radius, as opposed to the linear RLFF which
is given by the distance from the centre of mass of the M star to its
surface in the direction of the L1 point divided by the distance to
the L1 point.

Figure 11. Points show the map entropy obtained in each data set as a func-
tion of RLFF, where optimal masses were used for each RLFF. The optimal
systemic velocities found in Section 4.2.2 were adopted for the map re-
constructions. The points are plotted with a vertical offset of 0.1 between
data sets. Crosses mark the maps of maximum entropy, yielding the opti-
mal masses at the optimal RLFF. Fourth-order polynomial ﬁts are shown as
a visual aid. The peaks of these ﬁts were not used to determine the optimal
RLFF, as the high-order nature of the polynomial meant the ﬁts were of-
ten skewed. The mean RLFF across all data is 97 ± 1 per cent, where the
uncertainty represents the spread between maximum and minimum for all
measured values.

Figure 11 shows the map entropy as a function of RLFF. For
a given RLFF, the optimal masses are determined by reconstruct-
ing maps for many pairs of component masses. The optimal M1
and M2 are those that produce the map of maximum entropy (an
‘entropy landscape’, see Figure 8 of Hill et al. 2014). The values
of γ determined in Section 4.2.2 were adopted for the ﬁts, and re-
constructions were performed in steps of 0.5 per cent for the RLFF,
and in steps of 0.1M⊙ for the masses. The points follow a roughly
parabolic trend with some small ‘jumps’ in entropy that are mainly
due to the change in grid geometry, due to varying masses and
RLFF, combined with rounding errors in the code. However, all
optimum RLFFs determined from each independent data set are in
close agreement, ranging between 96–98 per cent, and so we can
be conﬁdent that the measured RLFF and masses are robust. The
amount of scatter in the entropy ‘parabolas’ is consistent with the
low SNR of the data being ﬁt – similar scatter was found when per-
forming Roche tomography with relatively low-quality data of the
CVs AM Her and QQ Vul (Watson et al. 2003).

There are a number of possible sources of systematic error
when ﬁtting data of poor SNR with Roche tomography. In this in-
stance, the dominant source of uncertainty in the system parameters
is due to the difﬁculty in determining the true continuum level of the
LSD proﬁles, as discussed in Section 4.1. If the continuum is too
low, the Roche lobe is artiﬁcially inﬂated to ﬁt the line wings, re-
sulting in larger measured masses. Furthermore, if the continuum is

set too high, the Roche lobe is artiﬁcially under-ﬁlled. To determine
the impact of choosing an incorrect continuum level, a range of off-
sets were added to the LSD proﬁles, and for each offset, the LSD
proﬁles were ﬁt and scaled as described in Section 4.1. The opti-
mal masses found for each offset were then compared and, across
all data, the maximum difference between the optimal primary and
secondary masses were 3.8 per cent and 7.9 per cent, respectively,
and the spread in RLFF was 1 per cent. Hence, while only a visual
check was made of the ﬁts to the continuum level of each set of
LSD proﬁles, the optimal masses and RLFF found for each data set
agree within these uncertainties.

−0.01M⊙ and MdM = 0.358+0.022

The mean RLFF is 97±1 per cent, with the mean of the masses
yielding MWD = 0.76+0.02
−0.018M⊙,
respectively, where all uncertainties represent the spread between
the maximum and minimum values. Hence, the mean mass-ratio
was found to be q = 0.47 ± 0.04. In Section 5 we will combine
the spectroscopic constraints with our light curve data to determine
more precise values for these parameters, but quote these Roche
tomography values here for completeness. Using the mean system
parameters with our model grid, we calculate v sin i to range be-
tween a minimum of 117.8km s−1 at phase 0 and 0.5, to a maxi-
mum of 133.5km s−1 at phase 0.25 and 0.75. Our measured masses
and RLFF agree well across all data sets, and so for consistency in
comparing maps, we adopted the mean values for the ﬁnal map re-
constructions (see Figure 13).

4.3 Surface maps

The mean system parameters found in Section 4.2 were used to
construct Roche tomograms of all data sets. The corresponding
trails of LSD proﬁles are displayed in Figure 9. Evident in both the
trails and the maps are numerous spot features, with three large-
scale features common to all trails and maps (marked A, B and
C in Figures 12 and 13). The technique of Roche tomography is
shown to be remarkably robust in the reconstruction of these fea-
tures – maps reconstructed independently with data taken on se-
quential nights show very similar features. The morphologies of

Figure 13. Roche tomogram of QS Vir using phase-binned data from all
data sets. Dark grey scales indicate regions of reduced absorption line
strength that is due to either the presence of starspots or the impact of irradi-
ation. The contrast in these Roche tomograms has been enhanced such that
the darkest and lightest grey-scales correspond to the lowest and highest in-
tensities in the reconstructed map. The orbital phase is indicated above each
panel, and Roche tomograms are shown without limb darkening for clarity.

these three features remain fairly unchanged over the 1 year pe-
riod of observations, with no apparent movement across the stellar
surface, indicating that these are indeed long-lived starspots. Fur-
thermore, smaller-scale structure is apparent in both the data and
ﬁts from the 2013 data, however the same level of detail is not as
readily reconstructed using other data sets, most likely due to the
fewer number of LSD proﬁles being ﬁt.

There is a distinct lack of a large high-latitude spot. Such a fea-
ture is commonly seen on Doppler imaging studies of rapidly rotat-
ing single stars (e.g. Donati et al. 1999; Hussain et al. 2007), and
in CVs such as BV Cen and AE Aqr (Watson et al. 2007, 2006).
Given the presence of such a feature in these other rapidly rotat-
ing stars, it is surprising to ﬁnd that a large high-latitude spot does
not exist here. Pertinently, a study by Morin et al. (2008) ﬁnds that
large-scale, mainly axisymmetric poloidal ﬁelds are fairly common
in fully convective M dwarfs, observing polar region spots on three
out of the six stars in their sample. However, the authors also found
that the partly convective star AD Leo hosted a similar magnetic
ﬁeld, but with signiﬁcantly lower magnetic ﬂux, indicating the gen-
eration of large-scale magnetic ﬁelds is more efﬁcient in fully con-
vective stars. As the measured mass of the M dwarf in QS Vir sug-
gests it has a partly radiative core, the lower efﬁciency of magnetic
ﬁeld generation may mean any polar region spots are signiﬁcantly
less obvious.

Alternatively, the lack of a large high-latitude feature may
simply be due observational effects – given the inclination of
i = 77.8◦ in QS Vir, high latitudes appear severely foreshort-
ened, and are heavily limb-darkened. These effects, combined with
the poor SNR of the data, may mean high-latitude features are
simply lost in the noise. This was assumed to be the case by
Barnes & Collier Cameron (2001) who found a similar lack of po-
lar spot features in their study of HK Aqr (i = 70 − 90◦), with
simulations showing that reconstructions of high-latitude features
strongly depend on the SNR of the data.

Other prominent features on the maps are the dark regions

around the L1 point, marked ‘B’ in Figures 12 and 13. In previ-
ous maps of CVs (e.g. Watson et al. 2003) features on this part of
the star were attributed to irradiation effects from the white dwarf,
where ionisation of the photosphere causes a decrease in photomet-
ric ﬂux. However, the features reconstructed here are patchy in mor-
phology, rather than smoothly varying, which suggests that irradia-
tion is not the main contributing factor of the features in this region.
This was tested by simulating a realistic irradiation pattern, and ﬁt-
ting the data using the same phases as that of the phase-binned LSD
proﬁles shown in Figure 12. The reconstructed irradiation pattern
was found to be smoothly varying, and was essentially uniform
around the front of the star. Likewise, the effect of gravity dark-
ening on map reconstruction was simulated using a gravity dark-
ening coefﬁcient of β ∼ 0.1, as found by Djuraševi´c et al. (2003,
2006) for late-type M stars. The simulated map showed the effects
of gravity darkening to be smoothly varying, with minimal contri-
bution to the mapped features. In addition, the dominant features in
the line proﬁles between phases 0.4–0.6 (as noted in Section 4.1)
were thought to originate off the stellar surface, and so these phases
were excluded from the ﬁt. Hence it is unlikely that circumstellar
material is the source of these patches around the L1 point.

We conclude that there is signiﬁcant spot coverage on the in-
ner hemisphere (white dwarf facing side of the M star) observed on
all maps. This spot distribution – where there is a higher density
of spots on the hemisphere facing the companion star – is similar
to that observed in many other systems, such as the pre-CV V471
Tau (Hussain et al. 2006), the eclipsing binary ER Vul (Xiang et al.
2015), and the close binary σ2CrB (Strassmeier & Rice 2003).
Furthermore, Kriskovics et al. (2013) suggested that the hot-spots
mapped on the companion-facing hemisphere in V824 Ara may
indicate the strong interaction between the magnetic ﬁelds of the
component stars, as is commonly observed in close RS CVn-type
binaries. This phenomenon was discussed in Hill et al. (2014),
where spot ‘chains’ from the pole to L1 point (on multiple CVs)
suggested a mechanism that forces magnetic ﬂux tubes to prefer-
entially emerge at these locations. Indeed, Holzwarth & Schüssler
(2003) propose that tidal forces may cause spots to form at pre-
ferred longitudes, and Moss et al. (2002) suggest that this phenom-
ena may also be due to the tidal enhancement of the dynamo action
itself.

Other features of interest include a prominent starspot labelled
‘A’ in Figure 13. It stretches ∼ 5–25◦ in longitude, and ∼ 15–
35◦ in latitude (where the back of the star is at 0◦ longitude, with
increasing longitude in the direction of the leading hemisphere).
Finally, label ‘C’ in Figure 13 points to a group of spots covering
275–300◦ longitude and spanning 20–55◦ latitude. Given that the
phase-binned data has a longitudinal resolution of ∼ 6◦, we can
reliably separate the larger spots in this group – one spot extends
275–285◦ longitudinally and 35–55◦ in latitude, and another spans
293–300◦ in longitude and 15–30◦ latitudinally. As both ‘A’ and
‘C’ can be seen in all data trails taken over a ∼ 1 yr period, they
are most likely groups of long-lived starspots.

The prominent spotted regions labelled ‘A’ and ‘B’ (located at
phases φ ∼ 0.05 and φ ∼ 0.5, respectively) are similar to those
found by Ribeiro et al. (2010) in their maps of QS Vir made using
photometry taken in 1993 and 2002. The authors ﬁnd two cool re-
gions at φ ∼ 0.4 and φ ∼ 0.9 that show little shift in longitude
between 1993 and 2002. The authors’ photometric data does not
allow for a tight constraint on latitude, however, if these spotted re-
gions are the same as those imaged here (namely features ‘A’ and
‘B’), they may be very long lived active regions that have remained
at the same longitudes for over 20 years.

The eclipsing WD/dM binary QS Vir

4.3.1 Spot coverage as a function of longitude and latitude

To make a more quantitive estimate of spot parameters on QS Vir,
we have examined the pixel intensity distribution in the Roche to-
mogram. By visual inspection, all reconstructed maps appeared to
have a very similar distribution of spots, with small-scale varia-
tion due to differences in SNR and number of spectra between data
sets. For an improved estimate of spot coverage, we combined all
data sets by phase-binning the LSD proﬁles over 60 evenly-spaced
phase bins (each containing ∼ 7 LSD proﬁles). We only present
analysis of the map that was reconstructed using this binned data
(see Figure 13).

The high inclination of the system causes a ‘mirroring’ effect,
as described in section 3.11 of Watson & Dhillon (2001). As ra-
dial velocities cannot constrain whether a feature is located in the
Northern or Southern hemisphere, features are mirrored about the
equator. This means features become less apparent due to the fact
that they are ﬁrst latitudinally smeared, and then mirrored, caus-
ing the streaks seen in the maps presented here. To mitigate this
effect, we discarded all pixels in the Southern hemisphere for the
remainder of this analysis.

Each pixel in our Roche tomograms was given a spot ﬁlling-
factor between 0 (immaculate) to 1 (totally spotted). The value for
any given pixel depended on its intensity, and was scaled linearly
between our predeﬁned immaculate and spotted photosphere inten-
sities. It is unlikely that the highest intensities represent the immac-
ulate photosphere, as the growth of bright pixels in maps that are
not ‘threshholded’ is a known artefact of Doppler imaging tech-
niques (e.g. Hatzes & Vogt 1992). Instead, we have deﬁned an in-
tensity of 92 and above to represent the immaculate photosphere.
Furthermore, we have deﬁned a 100 per cent spotted pixel by tak-
ing the minimum pixel intensity in the group of spots marked ‘B’ in
Figure 13, avoiding the very front pixels on the model star as these
may be additionally affected by gravity darkening or irradiation.

Based on our classiﬁcation of a spot, we estimate that
35 per cent of the northern hemisphere of QS Vir is spotted. This
is likely to be a lower limit due to the presence of unresolved spots
– O’Neal et al. (1998) estimated up to 50 per cent fractional spot
coverage in TiO studies of rapidly-rotating G and K type stars, and
Senavci et al. (2015) ﬁnd a factor ∼ 10 difference between spot
ﬁlling factors when comparing TiO analysis to Doppler imaging.
Furthermore, Hessman et al. (2000) predict a mean spot coverage
of ∼ 50 per cent on the CV, AM Her, using long-term light curve
analysis.

When plotted as a function of latitude (see Figure 14) we see
a clear increase in fractional spot coverage at low to mid latitudes
(10–50◦) of around 0.2, as compared to the spot coverage at higher
latitudes (50–90◦). This large spread in latitude may be indicative
of a distributed dynamo, with many unresolved small-scale fea-
tures spread across the stellar surface. A more likely explanation,
however, is that the spread is due to features becoming smeared in
latitude due to both poor SNR, and from limitations in the tech-
nique (as discussed above). Also apparent is a small increase in
spot coverage at high latitudes (centred ∼ 74◦). As discussed
above, the spot contrast at higher latitudes is diminished in this
system due to is high inclination, and so the measured spot cover-
age is likely underestimated at these latitudes. Similar distributions
of spots were found on the M dwarfs HK Aqr and RE 1816+541
by Barnes & Collier Cameron (2001), with the majority of features
equally distributed over 20–80◦ latitude.

When plotted as a function of longitude in Figure 15, we
ﬁnd a large increase in fractional spot coverage around 15◦, 180◦,

and 285◦ longitude, corresponding to the features marked A, B and
C, respectively, as shown in Figure 13. As previously discussed, the
large increase around 180◦ is similar to that found on CVs (e.g. AE
Aqr, Hill et al. 2014) and on pre-CVs (e.g. V471 Tau, Hussain et al.
2006).

4.3.2 Magnetic activity and star spot lifetime

The features marked A, B and C in Figures 12 and 13 are clearly
observed in all data sets from May 2013 to April 2014, and appear
to remain in ﬁxed positions over both short and long timespans.
This suggests a very low level of surface shear, with no perceiv-
able shift over the ∼ 1 yr between ﬁrst and last observations. As
the M star in QS Vir is very close to becoming fully convective, the
lack of any detectable differential rotation concurs with the conclu-
sions of Barnes et al. (2005), who found that differential rotation
appears to vanish with increasing convection depth. This trend was
also found in studies of rapidly-rotating M dwarfs by Morin et al.
(2008), where several stars in their sample exhibited fairly sim-
ilar magnetic topologies over the ∼ 1 yr period between obser-
vations. In other work, Morin et al. (2010) found both GJ 51 and
WX UMa to exhibit strong, large-scale axisymmetric-poloidal and
nearly dipolar ﬁelds, with very little temporal variations over the
course of several years.

We see no evidence of a magnetic activity cycle in our obser-
vations. O’Donoghue et al. (2003) suggested that the ±12 s spread
on ephemerides over their 10 years of eclipse timings may be due to
such a cycle. This appears unlikely, since their Figure 3 (b) shows a
∼ 0.12 per cent period change in ∼ 600 d – One would expect spot
migration to occur over the course of a magnetic activity cycle, as
seen on the Sun, and as we ﬁnd spot features are stable over a ∼ 1
yr period, such a cycle cannot be responsible for this rapid change
in period.

These features may well be related to the large prominences
that pass in front of both stars. Since the prominences appear to be
stable on a timescale of years, they must still be anchored to the

for the reconstructed map using phase-binned data. Points are calculated by

map), in steps of 1◦.

surface of the M star by its magnetic ﬁeld. Starspots are likely to
form near these anchor regions, as is seen in solar coronal loops
and prominences.

5 MODELLING THE ECLIPSE LIGHT CURVE

Eclipsing PCEBs have been used to measure precise masses and
radii of both the white dwarf and main-sequence components in
a number of systems (e.g. Parsons et al. 2010a, 2012a,b) offering
some of the most precise and model-independent measurements to
date for either type of star. The small size of the white dwarf leads
to very sharp eclipse features, with typical ingress and egress times
of around a minute or less meaning that high-speed photometry
is required to properly resolve the eclipse features. With typical
exposure times of < 3 sec, our ULTRACAM data fully resolve the
eclipse of the white dwarf and thus can be used to place stringent
constraints on the physical parameters of both stars.

We model

the light curve data using a code written
for the general case of binaries containing white dwarfs (see
Copperwheat et al. 2010 for a detailed description). The program
subdivides each star into small elements with a geometry ﬁxed by
its radius as measured along the direction of centres towards the
other star with allowances for Roche geometry distortion. We ﬁt-
ted the ULTRACAM u′g′r′ and i′ band light curves around the
eclipse of the white dwarf. We exclude data taken at other or-
bital phases since the effects of starspots on the surface of the
main-sequence star strongly inﬂuences the constraints that these
data provide. However, the effects of starspots on the white dwarf
eclipse itself are minor, since it is such a rapid process. Neverthe-
less, starspots often lead to linear slopes across the eclipse, that
vary over the timescale of our ULTRACAM observations. There-
fore, each eclipse observation was initially ﬁtted with a basic model
using the parameters from Parsons et al. (2010b) and including a
linear slope. This slope was then removed from each light curve
individually before combining them. Additionally, we shifted each
eclipse in phase to remove the effects of the deviations from linear-
ity in the eclipse arrival times.

The eclipsing WD/dM binary QS Vir

Figure 16. Flux calibrated ULTRACAM u′g′r′ and i′ band light curves of the eclipse of the white dwarf in QS Vir with model ﬁts overplotted (black lines).
We have offset the i′ band light curve by -13mJy to show more detail. The bottom four panels show the residuals of the ﬁt in the u′ band (top panel, blue
points), g′ band (second panel, green points), r′ band (third panel, orange points) and the i′ band (bottom panel, red points).

The basic geometric parameters required to deﬁne the model
are the mass ratio, q = Msec/MWD, the inclination, i, the scaled
radii of both stars, RWD/a and Rsec/a and the two temperatures,
Teﬀ,WD and Teﬀ,sec. In addition to these, the model also requires
the time of mid eclipse, T0, the period, P and the limb darkening
parameters for both stars.

Since we used phase-folded data we kept the period ﬁxed as
1, but allowed T0 to vary. The temperature of the white dwarf was
ﬁxed at Teﬀ =14,220 K. We use the same setup for limb darkening
as detailed in Equation 3 for both stars. For the M star, we use the
limb darkening coefﬁcients for a Teﬀ =3,100 K, log g = 5 main
sequence star in the appropriate ﬁlter (Claret 2000). We use the
coefﬁcients for a Teﬀ =14,000 K, log g = 8.25 white dwarf from
Gianninas et al. (2013). All these limb darkening coefﬁcients were
kept ﬁxed during the ﬁtting process.

The proﬁle of the eclipse of the white dwarf does not contain
enough information to simultaneously constrain the inclination and
the scaled radii of both stars, only how they relate to each other.
Therefore, an additional constraint is required to break this degen-
eracy. Ideally we would use the secondary eclipse (the transit of
the white dwarf in front of the M star, see Parsons et al. 2010a for
example), but for QS Vir this is too shallow to detect in our UL-
TRACAM data. An alternative method would be to use the ampli-
tude of the ellipsoidal modulation, which is related to the mass ra-
tio (which we have already spectroscopically constrained) and the
scaled radius of the M star (e.g. Parsons et al. 2012b). However,
the effects of starspots make this approach unreliable, even with
the Roche tomography results. Moreover, this limits our ﬁts to the

© 2015 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–20

longer wavelength bands where the M star dominates and hence
where the white dwarf eclipse is shallower and offers poorer con-
straints on its size. Therefore, this approach was not taken, although
we did check that our ﬁnal model results predicted an ellipsoidal
modulation amplitude consistent with the ULTRACAM data. An-
other method used to break the degeneracy between the inclination
and scaled radii, and that we use here, is to use our measurement
of the rotational broadening of the M star (Vrot sin i). For a syn-
chronously rotating star this is given by

Vrot sin i = Ksec(1 + q)

Rsec

a

,

(4)

where the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the M star (Ksec) and
the mass ratio (q) have both been spectroscopically constrained.
Hence, combining this with the ﬁt to the white dwarf eclipse allows
us to determine the inclination, radii of both stars and, via Kepler’s
laws, the orbital separation and masses of both stars. However, as
previously noted in section 4.2.3, the measured rotational broaden-
ing varies as a function of orbital phase, as the M star is not spheri-
cal and hence presents a different radius at different orbital phases.
Therefore, when ﬁtting the eclipse light curve we calculated the ro-
tational broadening of the M star at the quadrature phases (when it
is at its maximum) and compared this to the maximum value deter-
mined from our Roche tomography analysis.

We used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method
to determine the distributions of our model parameters (Press et al.
2007). The MCMC method involves making random jumps in the
model parameters, with new models being accepted or rejected ac-
cording to their probability computed as a Bayesian posterior prob-

16

ability. In this instance this probability is driven by a combina-
tion of the χ2 and the prior probability from our constraints from
the spectroscopy and Roche tomography. For each band an initial
MCMC chain was used to determine the approximate best param-
eter values and covariances. These were then used as the starting
values for longer chains which were used to determine the ﬁnal
model values and their uncertainties. Several chains were run si-
multaneously to ensure that they converged on the same values.

This approach results in very few systematic uncertainties in
the derived parameters, since the vast majority of them are directly
determined by the data itself. The temperatures of the two stars
are effectively scale factors and so have no effect. The shape of
the eclipse of the white dwarf is not altered by the adopted limb
darkening coefﬁcients for the M star, these are mostly important
for the transit of the white dwarf across the face of the M dwarf as
well as any ellipsoidal modulation, neither of which we consider in
our ﬁt. However, the choice of limb darkening coefﬁcients for the
white dwarf does have some effect on the ﬁnal parameters, specif-
ically the ﬁnal radius measurement for the white dwarf (and to a
lesser extent the M dwarf). To determine how large this effect is we
re-ﬁtted the eclipse light curves using limb darkening coefﬁcients
for a white dwarf with Teﬀ = 13, 500 K and Teﬀ = 14, 500 K
and log g = 8.00 and log g = 8.50, taken from Gianninas et al.
(2013), these bracket the coefﬁcients that we used in our ﬁnal ﬁt.
We found that the differences in the ﬁnal parameters were smaller
than their statistical uncertainties, implying that the white dwarf’s
limb darkening coefﬁcients have a very minor effect on the ﬁt.

The only other source of systematic uncertainty in the light
curve ﬁt arises from the Roche tomography analysis. As previously
mentioned, we used the rotational broadening and M dwarf radial
velocity semi-amplitude measurements from the Roche tomogra-
phy analysis to help break the degeneracies in the light curve ﬁt.
However, as Figures 10 and 11 show, the values vary slightly from
night to night. This was taken into account by increasing the uncer-
tainties on these two values to cover the spread of values seen on
different nights. Indeed, this is the largest source of uncertainty in
the ﬁt and limits how precisely we could measure the stellar masses.

The best ﬁt models to the white dwarf eclipse in the u′g′r′ and
i′ bands are shown in Figure 16, along with their residuals. The re-
sults from all four bands were consistent and the ﬁnal stellar and
binary parameters are detailed in Table 2. The results are consis-
tent with those of O’Donoghue et al. (2003), but a factor of 4 more
precise in mass and almost 10 in radius. In fact, the radius measure-
ment of the white dwarf in QS Vir is the most precise, direct mea-
surement of a white dwarf radius ever. It is remarkable that we have
measured the size of an object at nearly 50pc away to within 50km,
and highlights the potential for these kinds of systems to strongly
test theoretical mass-radius relationships. The measured masses of
the two stars are also consistent with the results from Roche tomog-
raphy (MWD = 0.76 ± 0.01M⊙, MdM = 0.36 ± 0.02M⊙).

An additional constraint on the stellar parameters comes from
the gravitational redshift of the white dwarf. For the measured pa-
rameters listed in Table 2 we would expect to measure a redshift
for the white dwarf of 45.8 ± 0.6km s−1 (taking into account the
redshift of the M star, the difference in transverse Doppler shifts
and the potential at the M star owing to the white dwarf). Tak-
ing the difference between the systemic velocities of the two stars
from our UVES data gives a measured gravitational redshift of
47.6 ± 1.2km s−1, which is fully consistent with our results.

6 DISCUSSION

6.1 The mass-radius relationship for white dwarfs

Figure 17 shows the mass-radius plot for white dwarfs and high-
lights the location of the white dwarf in QS Vir. We also plot
the model-independent mass-radius measurements of several other
white dwarfs, all members of close, eclipsing binaries. Inset we
show a zoom in on the white dwarf in QS Vir compared to the-
oretical models. The measured values show excellent agreement
with a carbon-oxygen core white dwarf model of the same temper-
ature and with a thick hydrogen envelope (MH/MWD = 10−4),
although the uncertainty in the measurements mean that thin-
ner hydrogen layers cannot be ruled out. This is consistent with
the results from other white dwarfs in PCEBs, such as NN Ser
and GK Vir, which both possesses hydrogen envelope masses of
MH/MWD = 10−4 (Parsons et al. 2010a, 2012a), although sev-
eral other eclipsing white dwarfs have thinner hydrogen envelopes
e.g. SDSS J0138-0016 (MH/MWD = 10−5, Parsons et al. 2012b)
and SDSS J1212-0123 (MH/MWD = 10−6, Parsons et al. 2012a).
Both white dwarf components of the eclipsing binary CSS 41177
appear to have thin hydrogen layers as well (MH/MWD < 10−4,
Bours et al. 2014). The only other reliable white dwarf hydrogen
envelope mass measurement in a PCEB system is for the pulsat-
ing white dwarf in SDSS J1136+0409, which was found to have
an envelope mass of MH/MWD = 10−4.9 (Hermes et al. 2015),
implying that there could be a substantial spread in the hydrogen
envelope masses of white dwarfs in PCEBs, possibly as a result of
the common envelope phase itself.

The temperature and surface gravity of the white dwarf in
QS Vir place it close to the blue edge of the DA white dwarf insta-
bility strip. However, our results are precise enough to ﬁrmly place
it just outside the strip, which is consistent with the null detection
of pulsations in our extensive high-precision photometry.

ues for the white dwarf in QS Vir as red contours (68 and 95 percentile

surements from eclipsing PCEB systems (O’Brien et al. 2001; Pyrzas et al.
2012; Parsons et al. 2010a, 2012a,b,c; Bours et al. 2014, 2015). Theoretical
mass-radius relationships for carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs are shown
in grey (Benvenuto & Althaus 1999) and helium core white dwarfs in blue
(Panei et al. 2007), labelled by temperature in thousands of Kelvin and for
hydrogen envelope thicknesses of MH/MWD = 10−4. Inset we show a
zoom of the measured QS Vir parameters with a theoretical mass-radius
relationship for a 14,200K white dwarf with a thick hydrogen envelope
(MH/MWD = 10−4, solid line) and a thin envelope (MH/MWD = 10−6,
dashed line), showing that the measured parameters are in excellent agree-
ment with the theoretical models for a white dwarf with a thick hydrogen
envelope.

6.2 The mass-radius relationship for low-mass stars

In Figure 18 we show the mass-radius plot for low-mass (<0.5M⊙)
stars along with a number of directly measured objects. The lo-
cation of the M star in QS Vir is indicated by the contours,
where we have used the volume-averaged radius. Its mass and
radius measurements are consistent with the evolutionary mod-
els of Morales et al. (2010) for a 1 Gyr magnetically active star.
Also highlighted in red are several other low-mass star mass-
radius measurements from PCEB systems. The M star in QS Vir
is the ﬁrst low-mass star in a PCEB that is not fully convec-
tive (MdM >0.35M⊙) to have high-precision, model-independent
mass and radius measurements. While the majority of these mea-
surements are consistent with theoretical models, two systems
(SDSS J1212-0123, Parsons et al. 2012a and SDSS J1210+3347
Pyrzas et al. 2012) have measured radii almost 10 per cent over-
inﬂated compared to these same models. Any possible explanation
for why some of these low-mass stars are over-inﬂated, while others
aren’t will require more high-precision mass-radius measurements
from PCEBs and more theoretical modelling of low-mass stars.

6.3 The current evolutionary state of QS Vir

The strong surface gravity of the white dwarf causes metals to sink
out of the photosphere on a short timescale. Therefore, the de-
tection of the Mg II 4481Å absorption line implies that the white
dwarf must be currently accreting some material originating from
the M star. Interestingly, the strength of this absorption is variable
as shown in Figure 19. It was slightly stronger in 2014 compared

sured values for the main-sequence star in QS Vir (volume-averaged
radius) as red contours (68 and 95 percentile regions). Also shown
as red points are other direct mass-radius measurements from eclips-
ing PCEB systems (Pyrzas et al. 2012; Parsons et al. 2010a, 2012a,b,c).
The black points are other direct mass-radius measurements taken from
Gómez Maqueo Chew et al. (2014). The solid grey line is the theoret-
ical mass-radius relation for a 1 Gyr main-sequence star (Baraffe et al.
1998), while the grey dashed line is for an active star of the same age

rameters showing that the radius is consistent with a theoretical active star
of the same mass.

to 2013. This supports the idea that the accretion rate of material
onto the white dwarf is variable on year timescales and is unlikely
to originate solely from the wind of the M star, but is likely driven
by ﬂare and coronal mass ejections (CME) events.

Matranga et al. (2012) detected clear X-ray eclipses, reveal-
ing that the white dwarf dominated the X-ray ﬂux rather than the
M star, supporting the idea of ongoing accretion. They determined
˙M = 1.7 × 10−13M⊙yr−1, which would
an accretion rate of
be one of the lowest accretion rates for a non-magnetic CV sys-
tem if this were the case, but would be particularly large for a
detached system. The authors speculate that a stellar wind could
be the source of the observed mass transfer, invoking a magnetic
‘syphon’ model, as found by Cohen et al. (2012). Matranga et al.
(2012) speculated that to maintain a more constant mass supply,
the wind could be supplemented by upward chromospheric ﬂows,
analogous to spicules and mottles on the Sun.

Conversely, Drake et al. (2014) used the HST spectra taken by
O’Donoghue et al. (2003) in 1999 to calculate an accretion rate of
10−16M⊙yr−1, around one thousand times lower than that found
6.5 years later by Matranga et al. (2012). This accretion rate is
more consistent with a wind accretion, and is an order of magni-
tude lower than the wind accretion rate inferred for similar pre-CVs
(Debes 2006; Tappert et al. 2011; Parsons et al. 2012a). This sup-
ports the idea that CME and prominence activity may provide a
stochastic source of accretion material.

In Parsons et al. (2011) we used the Mg II 4481Å absorption
line to rule out the Vrot sin i = 400km s−1 rapid rotation of the
white dwarf determined by O’Donoghue et al. (2003). The long ex-
posure time of that data (1800 s) meant that the line suffered from
substantial smearing and therefore it was consistent with having
no measurable broadening and we concluded that the white dwarf
was not rapidly rotating. Our new data have much shorter exposure

Figure 19. Equivalent width of the Mg II 4481Å absorption line from the
white dwarf as a function of time. The strength of the line appears to be vari-
able on year timescales, implying that the accretion rate of wind material on
to the white dwarf is not constant.

times (180 s) and can place better constraints on its rotational ve-
locity. In Figure 20 we show the Mg II 4481Å absorption line made
by combining all the data, overplotted with the best ﬁt TLUSTY
model (Hubeny & Lanz 1995) with Vrot sin i = 69km s−1. The
white dwarf moves by a maximum of ∼15km s−1 during each ex-
posure, meaning that there is clearly some additional broadening
of the line. If this is due to the rotation of the white dwarf then it
implies a rotational period of only 700 seconds, extremely fast for
a detached system and implies that there may well have been a pre-
vious stage of high mass-transfer. To spin up the white dwarf this
much would require an average accretion rate of ∼10−11M⊙yr−1
over the entire cooling age of the white dwarf, meaning that QS Vir
would almost certainly have to have been a CV in the past. Al-
ternatively, the white dwarf may posses a weak magnetic ﬁeld. A
ﬁeld strength of ∼105G is sufﬁcient to Zeeman split the Mg II line
by 69km s−1, mimicking a broadening of the line. This could also
help explain the stability of the prominence features, as the interac-
tion of the ﬁelds of the two stars may create stable regions.

There are several pieces of evidence that could suggest that
QS Vir is a currently detached CV (either hibernating or genuinely
detached, similar to a CV crossing the gap). The fact that the bi-
nary is very close to Roche-lobe ﬁlling, the white dwarf is relatively
massive (0.782M⊙, typical for white dwarfs in CVs but relatively
rare among PCEBs and pre-CVs Zorotovic et al. 2011) and could
be rapidly rotating, may indicate a previous episode of high mass
transfer. However, our results argue against this interpretation. The
RLFF of 96 per cent (97 per cent from the Roche tomography anal-
ysis), means that the M star is still within its Roche lobe, and the
fact that its mass and radius are consistent with evolutionary models
implies that it is not inﬂated. In CVs above the orbital period gap
the donor stars are oversized by roughly 30 per cent (Knigge et al.
2011) and would take at least 107 yr (the thermal timescale of the
M star) to relax back to their equilibrium radius once becoming de-
tached (i.e. if QS Vir is a detached CV, then it must have been so for
at least 107 yr). In this time the period has decreased by ∼15 min-
utes (assuming classical magnetic braking, Rappaport et al. 1983).
Hence, if the system is in a hibernating state, then the nova explo-
sion that caused the system to detach would have had to increase the
period by ∼15 minutes, an unrealistic prospect. Its current period
of 3.6 h is also well above the standard period gap. Therefore, we

conclude that the system is more likely to be a pre-CV just about to
ﬁll its Roche-lobe, and the white dwarf is weakly magnetic, mim-
icking the effects of rapid rotation. However, conﬁrmation of this
will require spectropolarimetry around the Mg II 4481Å line.

Assuming classical magnetic braking and following the proce-
dure outlined in Schreiber & Gänsicke (2003), we ﬁnd that QS Vir
will ﬁll its Roche lobe at a period of 3.363 hours, in 1.2 Myr. How-
ever, the strength of magnetic braking is highly uncertain. For ex-
ample, replacing the formula given by Rappaport with the nor-
malised prescription used by Davis et al. (2008) results in a signif-
icantly longer time until it ﬁlls its Roche lobe, i.e. 7.2 Myr. Given
that the current cooling age of the white dwarf is 350 Myr the prob-
ability of ﬁnding a system as close to Roche-lobe ﬁlling as QS Vir
is approximately half a per cent, which is not implausible given that
we now have more than 100 PCEBs with measured periods.

7 CONCLUSIONS

We have combined high-resolution phase-resolved UVES spec-
troscopy and high-speed ULTRACAM photometry of the eclipsing
PCEB QS Vir to precisely determine the binary and stellar param-
eters. We ﬁnd that both the white dwarf and its low-mass M star
companion have radii fully consistent with evolutionary models.
The spectroscopy revealed large prominence structures originating
from the M star passing in front of both stars. Despite being located
in unstable locations within the binary, these prominences appear
to be long-lived, lasting more than a year. Using Roche tomogra-
phy we determined that the M star is covered with a large number
of starspots, preferentially located on its inner hemisphere, facing
the white dwarf. They too appear to be long-lived and may well be
related to the prominences (e.g. located close to where the promi-
nences are anchored to the M star’s surface).

The M star in QS Vir ﬁlls 96 per cent of its Roche lobe and the
system appears to be a pre-cataclysmic binary, yet to have initiated
mass transfer via the inner Lagrange point, rather than a hibernat-
ing system. However, the white dwarf may be rapidly rotating, or
weakly magnetic, meaning that its past evolution is still uncertain.
It will become a cataclysmic variable system in 1.2 Myr with a pe-
riod above the period gap.
