We study the gravitational collapse of a kink within spherical symmetry and the characteristic
formulation of General Relativity. We explore some expected but elusive gravitational collapse issues
which have not been studied before in detail, ﬁnding new features. The numerical one-parametric
solution and the structure of the spacetime are calculated using ﬁnite diﬀerences, Galerkin colloca-
tion techniques, and some scripting for automated grid coverage. We study the threshold of black
hole formation and conﬁrm a mass gap in the phase transition. In the supercritical case we ﬁnd a
BH + K[λ− λ∗]2γ + f (K[λ− λ∗]2γ), with γ ≈ 0.37 independent of
mass scaling power law MBH = M∗
the initial data for the cases considered, and M∗
BH , K and λ∗ each depending on the initial datum.
The spacetime has a self-similar structure with a period of ∆ ≈ 3.4. In the subcritical case the
Bondi mass at null inﬁnity decays in cascade with ∆/2 interval as expected.

INTRODUCTION

The practical limit of General Relativity as it nears the
threshold of the quantum realm is an open issue. The an-
swer might involve elucidating where relativity fails and
whether there is a place where both theories merge. In
the strong ﬁeld limit near the formation of a black hole
Choptuik, discovered critical behavior [1] for a massless
scalar ﬁeld under spherical symmetry and minimally cou-
pled to gravity. Choptuik found: (i) a critical behavior of
Type II with a very small black hole mass; (ii) an unsta-
ble naked singularity by ﬁne-tuning generic initial data;
(iii) that the system follows a power law mass scaling and
shows discrete self-similarity. Critical behavior of Type
I is found when a massive scalar ﬁeld (a Compton wave-
length) is considered [3], [4]. For a review on the critical
phenomena for gravitational collapse, including quantum
extensions, see Ref. [5].

A self-gravitating massless scalar ﬁeld has been a piv-
otal toy model for Numerical General Relativity in many
diﬀerent ways: Astrophysically, in the black hole coales-
cence and merging to predict expected proﬁles of gravi-
tational radiation, relevant for detection [6]; Cosmolog-
ically, a possible connection with dark matter has been
speculated (see Ref. [7] and references therein); Mathe-
matically, the ﬁeld equations of the Einstein-Klein- Gor-
don system under spherical symmetry have the same
structure of those oﬀ spherical symmetry in vaccum [8].
Although the critical behavior was studied and com-
prehended deeply, the massless scalar ﬁeld still remains a
good playground to explore the non linear nature of grav-
ity. In the critical behavior of Type II, is the ﬁnal mass
ﬁnite? [9]. When the spacetime contains a black hole,
power law scaling with a mass gap is not obvious [10],

[11]. What about if we collapse a kink [12] up to a black
hole formation? From physical grounds the critical be-
havior should not depend in general on boundary-initial
conditions. We describe this system in terms of radia-
tion coordinates [13, 14], which in the case of spherical
symmetry the line element takes the form [15]

ds2 = e2βdu(cid:0)V r−1du + 2dr(cid:1) − r2(dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2). (1)

where β and V are functions of u and r. Here u is a time-
like coordinate; in a ﬂat spacetime u is just the retarded
time. Therefore, surfaces u = constant represent null
cones open to the future; r is a null coordinate (grr = 0)
such that surfaces r = constant are spheres; θ and φ are
the usual angular coordinates.

In these coordinates, the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equa-

tions reduce to [16, 17]

β,r = 2πr(Φ,r)2

(2)

(3)
and the scalar wave equation (cid:3)Φ = 0, which takes the
form

V,r = e2β

2(rΦ),ur = r−1(rV Φ,r),r.

(4)

The initial null data necessary for evolution consists of
Φ(u0, r), r ≥ R, at initial time u0. (We take u0 = 0).
At the mirror, we set Φ(u, R) = A = constant, with
the gauge condition that Φ(u,∞) = 0. We adopt the
coordinate condition β(u, R) = 0. The condition that the
metric matches continuously to a ﬂat interior for r < R
requires V (u, R) = R.

With these conditions the scalar ﬁeld and metric com-
ponents have a unique future evolution. The resulting

2

metric does not have an asymptotic Minkowski form
at I +. This is characterized by the quantity H(u) =
β(u,∞) which relates Bondi time t at I + to the proper
time u at the reﬂecting boundary according to dt/dτ =
e2H . Bondi time is the physically relevant time for dis-
tant observers. The Bondi mass of the system can be
expressed in either an asymptotic or integral form [18]:

FIG. 2: The Bondi mass MB as a function of the parameter
λ for diﬀerent values of α in datum A: 0.5; 0.6; 0.7; 0.8; 0.9
and 0.95 (curve not labeled in graph). Near the critical value
λ∗ for each α the mass gap is apparent, with a tendency to
close near α ≈ 0.95. The grid size for these calculations is
Nx = 3, 072.

FIG. 1: The Bondi mass MB as a function of the amplitude A
for the kink formed with the JNW solution, with R = 1. The
critical solution (Ac, Mc) without a mass gap is critical and
refers to a turning point. Below Ac the system has a mass
gap ∆M = M + − M− which corresponds to the same ampli-
tude A+ = A−. If we perturb the static solution (A−, M−),
below some critical parameter λ∗ the system decays to the
static solution; beyond λ∗ the system always forms a black
hole. If we perturb the static solution (A+, M +), below some
critical parameter λ∗ the system decays to the static solution
with less energy; beyond λ∗ the system always forms a black
hole. By construction of the kink we extract the naked singu-
larity contained in the JNW solution when it is analytically
extended to r = 0.

II. STATIC AND OTHER KINKS

The asymptotically ﬂat static solution Ψ of the
Einstein-Klein-Gordon system is an extremum of the en-
ergy, subject to a ﬁxed kink potential [12]. This solu-
tion [19], of Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW), can be ob-
tained in null coordinates by setting Φ,u = 0 in the wave
equation (4). This gives

rV Ψ,r = const.,

calculation corresponds to the initial datum D for Nx = 104.

evolutions λ < λ∗ reaching the limit value of Mλ<λ∗ ≈ 0.4157;

MΨ(0) = 0 to a maximum at the same turning point αc
and then decreases monotonically to the black hole limit,
MΨ(α) → R/2, as α → ∞ [12]. Figure 1 shows the ba-
sic setting of the system to study the critical behavior in
the gravitational collapse of a kink. The static solution
of JNW, and the physics behind it, is our starting point
to build four types of kinks and study their dynamics in
depth.

A. Globally perturbed static solution

From the JNW static solution, we construct a kink
for any speciﬁc value of α, truncating such a solution at
r = R and introducing the following simple global scale
perturbation

φ(0, r; α) = Ψ + λ

(11)

(cid:20) R − r

(cid:21)

2r(r + R)

keeping the values of the static kink as boundary condi-
tions. We know that for α = 1 and below λ∗ ≈ 0.1929
the perturbed kink does not form a black hole; instead
decays to the static solution.

B. Non compact initial kink

For a kink potential A > Ac no static equilibria exist.
With these boundary conditions, we would expect any
initial state to undergo collapse to a black hole [12]. We
explore then this by considering initial data of the form

2(Ac + λ)R

(R + r)

φ(0, r) =

(12)
for which a critical value of λ∗ = 0 no mass gap exist,
and we have to wait an inﬁnite proper time to observe
whether or not a black hole is formed.

,

C. Compact initial kink

From the above initial conditions and numerical exper-

imentation we arrived to the following kink

φ(0, r) =

R(Ac + λ)
re(r−R)2/σ2 ,

(13)

with a variance σ = 1/2. The Gaussian-like shape makes
this datum properly to explore the critical behavior in
the gravitational collapse of the kink.

D. Mixed initial kink

In order to combine the features of data B and C we
built the following initial datum, which resembles a Heav-
iside step-like descent function

φ(0, r) =

R(Ac + λ)

r

{1 + e(R−R0)/σ}
{1 + e(r−R0)/σ}

(14)

FIG. 4: δM as a function of ln(δλ) for the initial data C
(blue circles) and D (red squares), with Nx = 1.5 × 104. The
continuous line (black) roughly grows up with a power of
2γ ≈ 0.74. From the oscillatory main component we get a
period of ∆/2γ ≈ 4.59. The inserted graph shows the same
functions in a narrow window. Other unstable modes of de-
caying oscillations are apparent. In this graph we also show
results using the Galerkin-Collocation method for datum D
(green squares) with N = 350. Both methods, ﬁnite diﬀer-
ences and Galerkin-Collocation give the same results up to
some resolution.

FIG. 5:
ln[MB] as a function of τ for the initial datum D,
with Nx = 1.5 × 104. The mass decays in the lower right
quadrant roughly with a period of ∆/2 as expected.

The spacetime has a naked singularity when analytically
extended to r = 0 [19]. The Bondi mass of this solution
is

MΨ(α) = 2R sinh2 αe−2α tanh α.

(10)

The one-parameter family of static equilibria has kink
potential AΨ(α), given by (9), which increases mono-
tonically with α from AΨ(0) = 0 until
it reaches a
maximum at the turning point αc ≈ 1.199 satisfying
αc tanh αc = 1. Above αc, AΨ(α) monotonically de-
creases to 0 as α → ∞. Thus, below AΨ(αc) = Ac,
there are two static equilibria for each kink amplitude.
Similarly, the mass MΨ(α) increases monotonically from

dynamics and prescribe the formation or not of a black
hole.

ing with Python to ensure that the runs oﬀered a mostly

III. NUMERICAL METHODS, TESTS AND

OTHER TOOLS

The problem has been studied using two diﬀerent nu-
merical methods and some scripting. We brieﬂy resume
here these well established numerical solvers and the
wrapper scripts.

A. Finite diﬀerences

We use a null cone evolution algorithm for nonlinear
scalar waves developed in Refs.
[20, 21] (the 1D Pitt
code) adapted to the present setting as reported in [12].
The algorithm is based upon the compactiﬁed radial co-
ordinate x = r/(R + r), so that I + is represented by
a ﬁnite grid boundary, with x = 1/2 at the mirror and
x = 1 at I +. The code has been tested to be globally
second order accurate, i.e., the error in global quantities
such as the Bondi mass is O(x2) in terms of the grid
spacing x. This code has been used to get global energy
conservation near the critical behavior [22] in a setting
as originally studied by Choptuik.

B. Galerkin collocation

We have performed numerical experiments using the
Galerkin-Collocation method as described in Ref.
[11].
Brieﬂy, we have introduced a new radial coordinate η =
r/R − 1 to place the reﬂector at η = 0, and further com-
pactiﬁed the domain 0 ≤ η < ∞ into −1 ≤ x < 1. After
introducing the auxiliary ﬁeld Φ ≡ (1 + η)φ, the relevant
ﬁelds were approximated as series with respect to suit-
able basis functions that satisfy the boundary conditions.
For instance,

N(cid:88)

Φ(u, η) =

ak(u)ψk(η)

(15)

IV. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS

We explore numerically the power spectrum when a
black hole forms (super critical case). Are there critical
phenomena? In the threshold of the black hole formation,
is the spacetime discretely self-similar?

Data A and C were used in Ref. [12]; they are not the
best initial setting to explore in practice critical behavior.
These data evolve too slow to reach critical values with
the highest resolution, but they lead us to data C and D.
However we extract an expected feature from datum A,
that is, the mass gap can be reduced to zero. Figure 2
displays the mass gap as a function of λ for diﬀerent val-
ues of α. Figure 3 illustrates the mass gap for the initial
datum D, which is representative of any studied initial
condition, except datum B, as explained in the caption
of Figure 1. Figure 4 shows the mass spectrum in the
super critical case for data C and D. For this particu-
lar graph, we have considered the Galerkin-Collocation
method to evolve datum C. Figure 5 displays the natural
logarithm of the Bondi mass as a function of τ deﬁned as

τ = − ln[(t∗ − t)/t∗],

(16)
where t∗ is the accumulated Bondi time which corre-
sponds to the accumulated proper time referred to r = R.
From numerical experimentation we infer the following

mass scaling power law

δM = Kδλ2γ + f [Kδλ2γ],

(17)
where δM = MB−M∗, δλ = λ−λ∗, being f a non trivial
function of its argument. M∗ is the super critical mass
limit which corresponds to the critical amplitude λ∗.

In general our results show agreement between the Fi-

nite diﬀerences and the Galerkin collocation method.

To obtain one point for the black hole spectrum
(MBH , λ) it takes 65 minutes for a grid size of Nx =
15, 000 using a N1-standard-1 virtual machine on Google
Compute Engine.

V. DISCUSSION

where N is the truncation order, ak(u) are the unknown
modes and ψk(η) represent the basis functions. The ﬁeld
equations (2), (3) and (4) are reduced to a set of ordinary
diﬀerential equations for the modes ak(u).

C. Scripting

In order to make a large amount of numerical exper-
iments, minimize error of handling, processing the col-
lected data, and for exploration near the critical point of

When the spacetime contains a black hole and the criti-
cal behavior is studied, no mass gap is apparent [10], [11].
Simply the black hole increases the mass by the accreting
massless scalar ﬁeld. As it was pointed in Ref. [12], when
the scalar ﬁeld undergoes gravitational collapse to form a
horizon, some of the scalar energy is radiated to inﬁnity
and the remainder crosses the horizon and contributes
to the ﬁnal black hole mass. The mirror itself must fall
into the horizon for otherwise it would continue to reﬂect
the scalar ﬁeld until all scalar energy were radiated to

inﬁnity. Near the critical strength, the sensitivity of the
ﬁnal mass is somewhat analogous to the critical behavior
studied by Choptuik [1] except there is now a mass gap
because the ﬁnal black hole must have a mass larger than
R/2 in order to contain the mirror. Figures 2 and 3 show
the evidence of the expected mass gap as a rule, and no
mass gap as an exception. The black hole mass in the
critical behavior of type II can be ﬁnite.

The critical behavior as observed in this work is not
exactly as reported up to now. The kink setting may
contain more complexity, and further study is planned.
The spectrum of the variation of the Bondi mass δM as
a function of the natural logarithm of the variation of
the parameter, as displayed in ﬁgure 4, shows a curious
behavior related with the standard critical phenomena.
In fact, we observe the presence of ∆ and γ as originally
reported by Choptuik, but in the present case the mass
scaling power law is 2γ. We do not know yet why is
roughly twice the critical exponent of Choptuik. It is in-
triguing indeed for us, and we are reporting it as it was
found. Even more, very close to the critical point appear
an unstable main mode, followed by an unstable second
mode. We do not know up to now if with a better resolu-
tion will appear other subsidiaries minor modes or if the
second mode is the dissipation of the main mode because
of numerical error. We have conﬁdence that these pecu-
liar results are not a numerical artifact, instead they are
a consequence of nonlinearity near the critical values and
the boundary conditions. Clearly, the mismatch in the
critical exponent is due to the presence of the kink, con-
structed by means of a perfect reﬂecting barrier, and this
makes the system diﬀerent from the one originally stud-
ied by Choptuik. Other authors also have found diﬀerent
critical exponents when boundary conditions for the same
system changed [11] or other sources and dimensions are

5

considered [5], [24]. However, the system as we studied
basically behaves as Choptuik discovered: the spacetime
is discretely self-similar and has a power law mass scal-
ing. We emphasize in this paper the expected mass gap
conjectured in Ref.
[12], where the system was studied
with other motivations departing from that of Choptuik.
Thus, the mass gap was previously conjectured but not
found until now, and ﬁnding it was the main driver for
this paper. The “universal” critical exponent is respect
to the initial data, as has been clariﬁed in many works
after the pioneering work of Choptuik [5]. Finally the
Bondi mass can be singled out as in ﬁgure 5 in a such
way that the periodic decaying in the subcritical case is
∆/2, as expected for a dependence of the Bondi mass as
λ2, in agreement with Ref. [9].

The kink setting may look artiﬁcial or idealized. It is a
perfect reﬂector barrier and just to the interior the space-
time is Minkowskian, but it can be ﬁlled with a ﬂuid and
the radius of the mirror incorporated to the dynamics. A
number of other settings can be less unrealistic and the
kink will behave basically the same way. The next prob-
lem to study is the kink under the axial and reﬂection
symmetry, particularly motivated by the present results.
Although the subcritical zone in the present setting de-
serves a more accurate resolution. Work in this direction
is in progress.
