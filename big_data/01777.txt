In this paper we study the eﬀect of non-trivial spatial topology on quantum entanglement by
examining the degenerate ground states of a topologically ordered system on torus. Using the string-
net (ﬁxed-point) wave-function, we propose a general formula of the reduced density matrix when
the system is partitioned into two cylinders. The cylindrical topology of the subsystems makes a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in regard to entanglement: a global quantum number for the many-body states
comes into play, together with a decomposition matrix M which describes how topological charges
of the ground states decompose into boundary degrees of freedom. We obtain a general formula
for entanglement entropy and generalize the concept of minimally entangled states to minimally
entangled sectors. Concrete examples are demonstrated with data from both ﬁnite groups and
modular tensor categories (i.e., Fibonacci, Ising, etc.), supported by numerical veriﬁcations.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum phases of matter with intrinsic topological
order are exotic gapped states that cannot be described
in Landau’s symmetry-breaking regime. They are char-
acterized by novel properties, such as topological degen-
eracy of ground states, fractional quantum numbers and
fractional statistics of excitations and bulk-boundary cor-
respondence. By now it is widely accepted that the ex-
istence of long-range entanglement in these phases is the
physical origin of these exotic topological properties.

Therefore entanglement measurements are powerful
tools in understanding or characterizing topological
phases. Topological entanglement entropy1–3 and entan-
glement spectrum4 of the ground states are known to par-
tially characterize intrinsic topological order, while min-
imally entangled ground states5 can be used to extract
quasi-particle statistics of the system. Further, entangle-
ment entropy can be used in detecting both symmetry
protected and symmetry enriched topological phases6–9
as well.

To study how non-trivial spatial topology of a two-
dimensional system in a topological phase aﬀects quan-
tum entanglement, we concentrate on the string-net
ground state wave functions. String-net models14 are
exactly soluble lattice-spin models deﬁned on a trivalent
graph which realize a large class of non-chiral 2+1D topo-
logical phases. These include all phases whose low energy
eﬀective theories are discrete gauge theories or doubled
Chern-Simons theories. String-net states have universal
signiﬁcance when dealing with topological phases: They
are some typical tensor network states10, which can be
more generally viewed as renormalization group ﬁxed-
point states or wave functions11,12 because of their topo-
logical invariance13.

The set of input data to deﬁne the model is {I, d, δ, G}.

I = {0, 1,··· , N − 1} speciﬁes N string types that are
placed on each oriented link in the graph. For each
j ∈ I, there is a dual string type j∗ corresponding to
reversed orientation of the link. dj = dj∗ is the quan-
tum dimension assigned to each string type j ∈ I. The
rank-three tensor δijk speciﬁes fusion rules, i.e., the al-
lowed branchings of the graph.
(For simplicity we as-
sume the multiplicity-free case and take δijk to be either
zero or one.) Gijm
kln are the symmetrized 6j-symbols with
i, m, k, l, n ∈ I satisfying certain algebraic relations. This
set of data deﬁnes a unitary fusion category C. For a re-
view of the Hamiltonian of the model, see Appendix A.
Given a ﬁxed bipartition of the graph into two parts
A and B, one can calculate for a state Ψ of the system
the density matrix ρAB = |ΨihΨ| and the reduced den-
sity matrix ρA = T rB(ρAB). The entanglement entropy
is then given by S = −T r (ρA log ρA). For string-net
ground states with A a simply-connected region (disk,
sphere, etc.), it is known2 to be

S = −LXj∈I

j
D

log

dj
D − γ,

(1)

where L is the number of links along the boundary of
j the total quantum dimension and

the cut, D =Pj∈I d2

γ = log D.

The ﬁrst term demonstrates the familiar area law,
while the second term is independent of L and van-
ishes when the system does not have topological order
(D = 1). This gives rise to topological entanglement en-
tropy γ which is non-local and invariant under smooth
deformation of the ground state.

On a nontrivial manifold such as torus, systems with
intrinsic topological order can possess degenerate ground
states. Furthermore, nontrivial topologies of the two sub-
regions will aﬀect the entanglement entropy.5,15,16 The

total quantum dimension D is then unable to distinguish
between those degenerate ground states. This is exactly
the point where entanglement entropy enters the game.
In chiral Chern-Simons theories on torus, it is shown by
the surgery method16,17 that topological entanglement
entropy depends on linear combinations of basic degen-
erate ground states.

For non-chiral string-net models on torus, there is no
general analytic result considering two cylindrical sub-
systems A, B.

In this work, we propose an expression for general re-
duced density matrices in regard to the cylindrical bi-
partition and show that they are sensitive to diﬀerent
topological charges J of ground states ψJ of the model.
Furthermore, an additional decomposition matrix M en-
ters the expression, which describes how bulk topological
charges of the ground states split into boundary degrees
of freedom upon taking the partial trace. The speciﬁc
form of reduced density matrix makes it natural to deﬁne
the notion of entanglement sectors, which are sets of de-
generate ground states that have the same decomposition
pattern. Making use of the reduced density matrices, we
derive a general formula for entanglement entropy. The
L-dependent term in the expression for entanglement en-
tropy have similar structures as that on a disk-shaped
region, while the topological (L-independent) entangle-
ment entropy is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Variation shows
that the entanglement entropy is minimized when the
state contains only linear superpositions of ground states
in the same entanglement sector. Furthermore, we verify
that the upper bound of topological entanglement en-
tropy is consistent with the strong sub-additivity prop-
erty on torus derived in ref.5. We propose that above
properties hold generally for topological phases. Addi-
tionally, we discuss the applications of our results to en-
tanglement spectra and R´enyi entropies.

The paper is organized as follows.

In section II, we
review the derivation of eq.(1) and motivate our new for-
mulation of reduced density matrices. In section III we
take care of the case where both subsystems are cylinders
and give the general formula for entanglement entropy.
Section IV focuses on concrete models constructed from
irreducible representations of Zn groups, (non-Abelian)
S3 group and modular tensor categories, i.e., the double
semion, double Fibonacci, double Ising model, etc.. Sec-
tion V discusses the implications on entanglement spec-
tra, R´enyi entropies, boundary theories and outlooks fu-
ture directions.

II. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY ON A

DISK-SHAPED REGION

In this section, we reformulate the expression of re-
duced density matrix2 on a disk-shaped region, which
will be convenient to generalize to regions with nontriv-
ial topology.

Consider a bipartition of the trivalent graph on an ar-

2

bitrary manifold into two subsystems A, B with A having
the shape of a disk. For simplicity, on a trivalent graph
we always take the cuts which bipartites the system to be
those intersecting some links in the middle, correspond-
ing to the left ﬁgure in Fig.1.

FIG. 1: Left: rough cut. The cut (dotted line) interests some

Following ref.[2], any string-net conﬁguration inside a
disk-shaped region can always be deformed14 to basic
tree-like conﬁgurations in ﬁg.2. Outside the disk-shaped
region, any conﬁgurations can be deformed to similar
tree-like conﬁgurations.

Tracing out the degrees of freedom in B, the reduced
density matrix for the subsystem A is, (see eq. (9) of ref.
[2]),

up to a normalization factor of D1−L, with L the number
of links at the boundary.

One observes that in the above eq.(2), the reduced den-
sity matrix is diagonal and depends only on quantum
dimensions of boundary links.

Speciﬁcally, consider the case where we have three
boundary links. For a possible L = 3 conﬁguration,
the admissibility condition or branching rule δp1p2p3 = 1
must be satisﬁed. The reduced density matrix is thus

ρ3 =

1
D2 ⊕p1,p2,p3

(δp1p2p3 dp1 dp2 dp3 ) ,

with x ⊕ y understood as the 2 × 2 diagonal matrix with
diagonal entries x, y.
in the L = 4 case, the branching rules
1 p3p4 = 1 must be satisﬁed. The reduced

Similarly,

δp1p2s1 = δs∗
density matrix is then

One observe that both the number of δ’s and d’s in-
crease with respect to L. Since we are interested in the
large L limit, it would be convenient to reformulate the
above expression in a more compact form. Furthermore,
we want L to be explicit in the equation. These con-
siderations lead naturally to the formulation of reduced
density matrix using ﬁber fusion category(FFC). We do
not require most of the machinery of FFC for the formu-
lation and will only list the relevant, easy-to-understand
pieces. For readers who are mathematically intended, the
concepts of FFC is brieﬂy reviewed in Appendix B.

Deﬁne α to be a complex function of variable j ∈ I

with values in complex numbers C,

α(j) = αj = dj /D.

We deﬁne a tensor product by,

α⊗2
k ≡ (α ⊗ α)k = ⊕i,j∈I

(αi · αj) δijk∗ .

(3)

(4)

This is a diagonal matrix, i.e., x ⊕ y is again understood
as a 2 × 2 matrix whose nonzero entries are the diagonal
ones x, y.

One step forward, we have

α⊗L

k ≡(cid:16)α⊗(L−1) ⊗ α(cid:17)k

= ⊕i,j∈I(cid:16)α⊗(L−1)

i

· αj(cid:17) δijk∗ .

(5)

For L = 3 one has,

α⊗3
k = ⊕i,j,l,m∈I

[(αiαjδijl∗ )αmδlmk∗ ] .

Plugging in the deﬁnition of α and relabel i, j, m as

p1, p2, p3, this reduces to

α⊗3

k =

1
D3

⊕p1,p2,l,p3∈I

(δp1p2l∗ δlp3k∗ dp1 dp2 dp3 ) .

Comparing the above expression with that of ρ3, we ob-
serve that we have one additional δ to get rid of. To
this end, we introduce a projection operator P0, which
maps any vector f = {f0, f1,··· , fN −1} to P0(f ) =
(Components of the vector f does not

have to be complex numbers; they are generally matri-
ces. Projecting out a matrix thus sets all its entries to
be zero.) Graphically, this projection corresponds to the
link 0 in ﬁg.2. Applying P0 to the above equation, we
have

P0(cid:0)α⊗3(cid:1) =

1
D3 ⊕p1,p2,p3

(δp1p2p3 dp1 dp2 dp3 ) ,

(6)

where the identities dj = dj∗ and δlp30 = δp30l∗ for all
j ∈ I have been used. (Here the δ-symbol on the right
hand side is understood as the Kronecker delta). We
arrive at the equality ρ3 = DP0(cid:0)α⊗3(cid:1).
ρL = DP0(cid:0)α⊗L(cid:1) .

Generally we write the reduced density matrix

(The overline on ρ is a notation instead of conjugation.)
One can easily work out the case for L = 4, and see that
ρ4 coincide with the ρ4 given above. Before stating a
general proof, we note that α⊗L is fully determined by
boundary degrees of freedom, while the projection en-
forces a global constraint on the system. We expect this
independence of bulk degrees of freedom to be a general
feature of disk-shaped systems with topological order, as
partially implied in references [18–21].

Theorem I. Entanglement entropy calculated from the

density matrix (7) is the same as from eq.(1).

Lemma (1). Denote β = α⊗L with L a positive integer
and βj = Pj (β) with Pj the projection operator map-
ping any vector of matrices f = {f0,··· , fj,··· , fN −1}
to Pj (f ) = {0,··· , fj,··· , 0}. Then
trβj = 1.

Note that a sepcial case of the lemma with j = 0 guar-
antees the trace of ρL to be unity. Proof can be found in
Appendix C.

Proof of Theorem I. Notice that to cut out a simply
connected region, the number of links crossing the bound-
ary between the two regions should satisfy L ≥ 2. (One
can also have the case L = 0, which is of no physical
interest and thus ignored.)

For L = 2, eq.(1) gives

On the other hand, S2 = −ρ2 log ρ2 gives
S2 = − [DP0 (α ⊗ α)] log [DP0 (α ⊗ α)] = S2.
So we conclude for L = 2, it is indeed the case that the
entanglement entropies computed from these two meth-
ods are the same. For L > 2, we just need to verify
that

III. ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY ON A

TORUS

Topologically ordered systems can have degenerate
ground states on a torus, i.e., energy itself is not able
to distinguish among them. Entanglement entropy, on
the other hand, serves as a quantitative measure to split
the degeneracy from an information perspective, at least
partially. In this section, we study nonchiral topological
phases and give a general expression for both the reduced
density matrix and entanglement entropy. It is argued in
ref.5 that the ground states of a topologically ordered sys-
tem with minimal entanglement entropy (with respect to
the same bipartition) are eigenstates of Wilson loop op-
erators deﬁned for loops parallel to the cut. Below we
show that for nonchiral topological systems, the concept
of minimally entangled states needs to be generalized to
minimally entangled sectors (MESe): they are linear su-
perpositions of speciﬁc minimally entangled states chosen
in a unique way. Entanglement entropy cannot distin-
guish between states in the same sector.

A. Ground State Wavefunction

Consider any two trivalent graphs discretizing the same
surface (torus here). Mathematically, they can always
be mutated to each other by a composition of the local
Pachner moves22. Physically, between the two (diﬀer-
ent) Hilbert spaces deﬁned on the two graphs, there is
a mutation transformation by a composition of the basic
Pachner moves. It can be proved14,23 that the mutations
are unitary in the ground-state subspace and the ground
states are invariant under such mutations. An outline of
the proof can be found in Section III of ref.24. In other
words, topological properties of ground states are robust
against local deformations of the graph/Hilbert space.

As a result, we can always reduce an arbitrary graph on
the torus to a simplest one using a sequence of Pachner
moves and study the properties of ground states in a
reduced Hilbert space. The other way around, we can
always return to more complicated graphs easily using
the mutation transformations. The simplest graph on a
torus has two vertices, three edges and one plaquette, as
indicated in the ﬁgure below.

FIG. 3: The simplest graph on torus contains two vertices,
three links and one plaquette.

Any conﬁguration on torus can thus be expressed on
the simplest graph as |jiki. Modular transformations on
the ground-state subspace are constructed by,23

where we have chosen the T -action to be cutting the
uncontractible loop consisting of the links j and k (the
meridional loop), twisting the boundary by 2π and gluing
it back. We lay the ground states in the basis composed
of the eigenvectors of T ,

T |ψJ i = θJ |ψJ i .

This basis {ψJ } is also called the quasiparticle basis in
the literature. The symbol J labels species of topological
charges (or equivalently bulk quasiparticles) and θJ is the

(14)

The zJ
jijk tensor is called the half-braiding tensor satis-
fying some consistency conditions that characterize each
ψJ . Every such tensor is a map of vector spaces V ji
k →
V ij
k which results from exchanging i and j which are
in the k-fusion channel. An introduction to these half-
braiding tensors can be found in ref.24. If the input cat-
egory is the representation category of an Abelian group
ZN or a modular tensor category, the analytic expression
for those z tensors are known24. For non-Abelian groups
a numerical solution is generally involved.

Physically, every such state (14) can be understood
as creating a pair of excitations with topological charges
J and J ∗ from the trivial ground state, winding one of
them around one uncontractible loop of the torus and an-
nihilate them. In other words, a ground state ψJ can be
understood as a ﬂux of quasiparticle J threading through
the torus, see the ﬁg.4 below.
The reason why those z-tensors enter the expression
can be understood as follows. The most distinguished
property of the excitations in a topological phase is that
they can have nontrivial braiding statistics, arising from
the half-braiding tensors z. These half-braiding tensors
need to satisfy the naturality conditions24 that guaran-
tee the consistent properties of two sequential braidings.
Each independent solution to the naturality conditions
corresponds mathematically to an irreducible representa-
tion J of the quantum double of the input data. There-
fore, each quantum double label J oﬀers a consistent
way for some potential excitation to braid and thus cor-
responds to one excitation species. Due to the correspon-
dence between quasiparticles and ground states described

in the last paragraph, it is natural that every ground state
in quasiparticle basis can be explicitly constructed from
the quantum double of the input data, i.e., the z-tensors.

We focus on the bipartition where both subsystems
have cylindrical topologies. Our partition, named as
double-cylinder cuts, is speciﬁed in ﬁg.4. The two red
cuts (color online) are parallel to the meridional loop of
the torus, crossing L1 and L2 links respectively. Direc-
tions of the links are ﬁxed as in the ﬁgure. When the
conﬁgurations do not match the such directions, one can
simply reverse orientation of those mismatched strings
and relabel them as their dual strings.

The two red (color online) cuts are parallel to the meridional

possess L1 and L2 boundary links respectively. Directions
of the links are ﬁxed as in the ﬁgure (when the conﬁguration
doesn’t match the such directions, reverse orientation of those
mismatched strings and relabel them as their dual strings).
These directions and can alternatively be understood as “di-
rection” of the cut, as indicated by the red arrows.

For the simplest graph described above, we have L1 =
L2 = 1. Subsystem B consists of links i, k and part of j,
while subsystem A contains the other part of j, as shown
in ﬁgure 5.

(Note that because of this constraint expressed by Kro-
necker delta, smooth cuts which intersect with vertices
instead of links and rough cuts which intersect with link
are equivalent after taking the partial trace.)

Physical meaning of the matrix will be illustrated in

the next subsection.

B. Reduced Density Matrix on a General Graph

One can use the deformation laws24 to obtain an arbi-
trary trivalent graph from the simplest one in ﬁg.3. Using
the cuts deﬁned above in ﬁg.4 on a general trivalent graph
with the number of boundary links L1 and L2, one can
trace out the degrees of freedom in one of the cylinders
B and calculate the diagonalized reduced density matrix
of subsystem A for ψJ as,

ρA;J =Xj∈I

MJ j(cid:20) D

dj

Pj(cid:0)α⊗L1(cid:1) ×

D
dj

Pj(cid:0)α⊗L2(cid:1)(cid:21) .

(18)
The two factors in the square bracket in eq.(18) de-
scribe the two boundaries of the cylinder A, relatively
independent as indicated by the direct product but sub-
jected to one global constraint of conservation of quan-
tum numbers given by Pj. The projection operators leave
some of the entries of matrices αLi (i = 1, 2) to be zero,
but do not eliminate the relevant rows or columns. Thus
the summation here is the usual summation among ma-
trices of same dimensions. D/dj is the normalization
factor resulting from Lemma 2.

Introducing the M matrix is one of our central ideas.
It reﬂects how the information of diﬀerent ground states
are displayed on boundary degrees of freedom. Topo-
logical charges of ground states in topological phases are
dyons, i.e., composites of charges and ﬂuxes. One species
of topological charge J can have one ﬂux type and multi-
ple charge types. To calculate the entanglement entropy,
one needs to partition the system into A and B, which
creates by hand two trivial domain walls or boundaries
between the two subsystems. After tracing out one of
the subsystems B, information carried by B “collapses”
to the boundaries of A.

Consider a pair of topological charges J and J ∗ cre-
ated in the bulk of A and moved to the two boundaries.

Upon reaching the boundaries, they suﬀer from the par-
tial trace; information of the ﬂuxes are traced out while
information of charges survives. Furthermore, charges
are exactly described by objects in the label set I, i.e.,
they one-to-one corresponds to string types. Thus start-
ing from a topological charge J in the bulk, one obtains
some charges j1, j2,··· ∈ I expressed by the string types
of boundary links. The fact that it is possible to have
multiple j’s for a single J corresponds to the fact that a
dyon species can carry multiple charges.

To be more concrete, we have

J → ⊕j

MJ jj.

(19)

From the mathematical perspective, MJ j

In other words, the entry MJ j is the multiplicity of the
appearance of j in the decomposition of J . In the above
ﬁg.6, one observes that the M matrix simply describes
how a ground state J is reﬂected on the link j on the
loop.
=
dim Hom(J , j), which is the dimension of the homset
of morphisms inside the input category C. J is really
an object in the category Z(C) which is the categor-
ical (Drinfeld) center of C. But we apply a forgetful
functor to make J forget the half-braiding structure
z and J reduces to objects in C. Thus calculation of
entanglement entropy will be the decomposition map
F : Z(C) → C. Since the input category C is the category
of charges, what is left is the information of charges and
the information of ﬂuxes are lost.

We note that the above expression (18) for reduced
density matrix can also be observed from procedures sim-
ilar to that of part II. For a cylinder with two boundaries,
one can always reduce the string-net graph to one loop
and L1 + L2 tails, as shown in ﬁgure 6. The loop can
be open if one erases the vacuum string 0. Below is an
example of L1 = 4, L2 = 3.

while upper and lower tails are labeled by {p} and {q}.

C. Entanglement Entropy

For a general ground state Ψ = PJ cJ ψJ with cJ
complex numbers satisfying PJ |cJ |2 = 1, the reduced

density matrix is,

(20)

This expression is our main result. One can observe
from the above expression that if two rows of the M
matrix are the same, i.e., if two J ,J ′ have the same
pattern of decomposition into charges, then the reduced
density matrix cannot distinguish between the them. We
say that such ground states ψJ and ψJ ′ are in the same
entanglement sector. The reduced density matrix will
be sensitive only to the summation of probabilities for
states in the same entanglement sector, instead of the
probability for every single ψJ .

It follows from eq.(20) and S = −tr (ρA log ρA) that

the entanglement entropy is,

Case (2) is “chiral”. The entanglement entropy for a

Eq.(24) is our main interest and captures “nonchi-
ralness” to the full. Observe that ﬁrst term is now
indicating the reference point is now
a(L1 + L2 − 2),
(L1, L2) = (1, 1) instead of (0, 0) since it is the smallest
possible number of links that can contain the topologi-
cal information of a torus. The second term is sensitive
to speciﬁc ground state ψJ , while the third term is a
measurement of the mixture of diﬀerent ground states.

One observe that the L-dependent term is of a similar
form with the disk case. Furthermore, quantum dimen-

which is maximized when the entanglement entropy is
minimized. Comparing the above eq.(24) with (1), one
observes that the nontrivial topologies of the two subre-
gions make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence: apart from a global
quantum number J which labels degenerate ground
states, the decomposition matrix also comes into play.
Variations of γ with respect to |cJ |2’s show that the
point where all the ﬁrst-order diﬀerentiations goes to zero
realizes the minimal instead of maximal topological en-
tanglement entropy. Maximum of the topological entan-
glement entropy can only be realized at points where the
total probability of every entanglement sector is 0 or 1.
So minimally entangled states generalize to minimally
entangled sectors in our nonchiral case.

Depending on the input data, there exist possibilities
where multiple entanglement sectors can maximize γ.
But the entanglement sector which includes ψ1, (where
1 is the trivial quasiparticle or trivial ground state,) is
deﬁnitely one of them. In other words, the case of J = 1
gives us the upper bound for topological entanglement
entropy, which by straightforward calculation is 2 log D.
This is twice the topological entanglement entropy for
the disk-shaped geometry, matching perfectly with the
strong sub-additivity property (or called the uncertainty
principle) of topological entanglement entropy on torus
derived in ref.5.

String-net models are exactly solvable models whose
wavefunctions are ﬁxed points of the renormalization
group. More generally when one perturbs the wavefunc-
tions away from string-net, we expect that there will
be changes in the L-dependent term, but not in the L-
independent term. The reason is that the L-independent
term is topological and depends thus solely on the topo-

logical order of the system. Thus it will be invariant as
long as the smooth deformation do not close the gap of
the system.

Further simpliﬁcations of the above equations will be
in place when one considers Abelian models: the three
diﬀerent cases (21),(23), and (24) recombine to one ex-
pression.

IV. EXAMPLES

In this section, we study speciﬁc examples and compare
entanglement entropy obtained from direct calculations
and from the above formula. At least up to L1 + L2 = 9,
for all those examples the formula are exact. We argue
that the formula is exact for all L1, L2.

A. ZN Toric Code

For RepZN model, the string types correspond to the
N irreducible representations of the group, denoted by
L = {0, 1, . . . , N − 1}. Fusion rules are δijk = 1 if i + j +
k = 0 mod N and 0 if else. The 6j symbols are given
by Gijm

kln = δijmδklm∗ δjkn∗ δinl.

We have N 2 elementary ground states labeled by J =
(g, µ), with g, µ taking integer values 0, 1, . . . , N − 1. g’s
correspond to the group elements (ﬂuxes), while µ’s cor-
respond to the irreducible representations (charges). The
relevant decomposition matrix is given by

M(g,µ),j = δµj .

For arbitrary L1, L2 > 0, the entanglement entropy is

thus
S =(L1 + L2 − 2) log D

−Xj  XJ

|cJ |2 MJ j! log XJ

|cJ |2 MJ j! .

(29)

Speciﬁcally, for the Z2 toric code model25, the label
set is I = {0, 1}. All the strings are self-dual, i.e. j =
j∗. The quantum dimensions are d0 = d1 = 1 and the
nontrivial fusion rule is δ110 = 1. Topological charges of
ground states are J ∈ {1, e, m, ǫ}, the second of which
often referred to as electric charge, the third the magnetic
ﬂux, while ǫ is a fermionic combination of the former two.
For the cuts deﬁned above, the decomposition matrix

is given by,

M10 = Mm0 = 1, Me0 = Mǫ0 = 0,
M11 = Mm1 = 0, Me1 = Mǫ1 = 1.

The entanglement entropy is,

for arbitrary L1 >

0, L2 > 0,
S =(L1 + L2 − 2) log 2

−Xj  XJ

|cJ |2 MJ j! log XJ

|cJ |2 MJ j! .

(30)

If the ground state contains only a single ψJ , the above
expression reduces to S = (L1 + L2 − 2) log 2.

B. Double Fibonacci Model and General Modular

Tensor Category Case

Non-Abelianness introduces more interesting aspects
into the system. We start with the simplest double Fi-
bonacci model. The string types are L = {0, 1} (some-
times also denoted by {1, τ}), both of which self-dual.
Let φ = (1 + √5)/2 be the golden ratio, the quantum
dimensions are then d0 = 1 and d1 = φ.

The nonzero fusion rules are δ000 = δ011 = δ111 = 1.
Nonzero independent 6j-symbols G are given by G000
000 =
1, G011
111 = −1/φ2.
All other 6j-symbols can be obtained from the Tetrahe-
dral symmetry reviewed in Appendix A.

111 = 1/√φ, G111

011 = G011

111 = 1/φ, G000

There are four quantum double labels: (cid:8)00, 01, 10, 11(cid:9),
or equivalently, (cid:8)11, 1τ , τ 1, τ τ(cid:9) . The quantum dimen-

sions are respectively 1, φ, φ, φ2.
The decomposition matrix is,

M00,0 = 1, M01,1 = 1, M10,1 = 1,
M11,0 = 1, M11,1 = 1.

We give a brief derivation of the entanglement entropy
from the expression of reduced density matrix. Let’s start
from ψ00. From eq.(18), we have

Denote α⊗L1 = β, α⊗L2 = σ. Using Lemma (1) and

ρ{A;00;L1,L2} = DP0(cid:0)α⊗L1(cid:1) × DP0(cid:0)α⊗L2(cid:1) .
Lemma (2), it is easy to show that for L1 ≥ 2,
S{00;L1+1,L2} − S{00;L1,L2} = a.

(34)

(33)

Combining with the fact that the two boundaries of the
cylinders are symmetric and that the cases where L1
and L2 are smaller than 2 can be computed directly,
one can prove the expression for entanglement entropy
(21)(23)(24).

Relations for other J ’s can be proved in similar proce-
dure. For a general ground state Ψ = PJ cJ ψJ , again

we focus on the veriﬁcation of

S{L1+1,L2} − S{L1,L2} = a.

(35)

Upon simpliﬁcation, the left hand side becomes

ah(cid:16)|c00|2 + φ−2 |c11|2(cid:17) +(cid:16)|c10|2 + |c01|2 + φ−1 |c11|2(cid:17)i

= a = r.h.s..

(36)

For general models constructed from modular tensor
categories,
including double semion and double Ising
model, there is a general result. Consider the label set
I = {0, 1,··· , N − 1}. We have for quantum doubles
N 2 irreducible representations labeled by J = ab with
a, b ∈ I. The quantum dimensions are dab = dadb. The
pure ﬂuxes are those described by bb. Decomposition
matrices are given by26,

Mab,j = δabj∗ .

(37)

As additional examples, we carried out the direct com-
putations of entanglement entropy for double semion and
double Ising case up to L1 + L2 = 9 and by comparison
found the above formula for entanglement entropy exact.

C. Non-Abelian Finite Group S3

trix as,

Another interesting example concerns string-net model
constructed from irreducible representations of non-
Abelian ﬁnite groups G. The ﬂuxes are classiﬁed using
the conjugacy classes of the group, while the charges are
classiﬁed by irreducible representations of the group. The
elementary ground states and representations of quantum
doubles are denoted by pairs (A, µ), where A labels a con-
jugacy class of G, and µ is an irreducible representation
of the centralizer ZA = {g ∈ G | ghA = hAg}. Here hA is
an arbitrary representative in CA but is ﬁxed once and
for all. Note that (A, µ) reduces to (g, j) in the Abelian
case.

The simplest case is the RepS3 model. The with label
set I = {0, 1, 2}, quantum dimensions d0 = d1 = 1 and
d2 = 2. Nontrivial fusion rules are δ110 = δ220 = δ221 =
δ222 = 1.

All group elements of S3 (or D3) are generated by sym-
metry actions s and r on a triangle, where s is a rotation
by π radians about an axis connecting the center and
a vertex of the triangle, and r the rotation around the
center of the triangle by 2π/3. Conjugacy classes of the
group are thus given by [e] = {e}, [s] = {s1r1, s1r0, s1r2}
and [r] = {s0r1, s0r2}. The centralizers of the conjugacy
classes are given by N[e] = S3 with three representa-
tions 0, 1, 2, N[r] ∼= Z3 with three representations 0, 1, 2,
N[r] ∼= Z2 with three representations 0, 1. There are eight

ing the notation of ref.24.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this work we studied quantum entanglement in topo-
logical phases on torus. We proposed a general formula
for reduced density matrix (20) and entanglement en-
tropy in string-net models on torus (24) with cylindrical
partitions. We studied the minimal entanglement and
generalized minimally entangled states to minimally en-
tangled sectors.

With the diagonalized reduced density matrices explic-
itly obtained, one can easily calculate the entanglement
spectra and R´enyi entropies of relevant systems. General
R´enyi entropy is deﬁned as:

SR =

1

1 − α′ log tr(cid:16)ρα′
A(cid:17) .

(41)

For all the examples mentioned above, we found the
topological entanglement entropy unchanged with re-
spect to α′ in the large-L limit, while the L-dependent
term varies with α′. This independence of α′ in topo-
logical R´enyi entropy is due to the simple structure of
our reduced density matrix. Furthermore, increase in α

10

leads to severer ﬁnite-size eﬀects and takes larger L1, L2
for the entanglement entropy to grow stably in a linear
way, which is consistent with previous results27.

One direct future direction will be to look at the gen-
eral relationship between boundary theories and entan-
glement entropy because of the similar mathematical
structure of our decomposition matrix and that of anyon
condensations26,28–34.

It turns out that partial trace in the calculation of
entanglement entropies corresponds to the condensation
of all ﬂuxes. To see this, we use the RepZ2 toric code25
model as an example. We have topological charges of the
ground states J ∈ {1, e, m, ǫ} with 1 and m the ﬂuxes,
while j ∈ {0, 1}. When these topological charges move
to the boundary, the ﬂuxes are traced out, which are
described by the action of (1 ⊕ m):

part of the anyon-condensed state. In contrast, the j in
our expressions labels the boundary degrees of freedom
along our partitioning cuts, or a boundary excitation in
the whole anyon-condensed state, including the conﬁned
ones. Furthermore, the boundaries in our context are
not real physical boundaries, but boundaries of the par-
titions.

Our results on nonchiral lattice systems are diﬀerent
from the those in chiral cases studied in ref.5,16. We ex-
pect this diﬀerence to be essential and believe that future
studies on the relationship between boundary theory and
entanglement will provide deeper insights to the issue.

Finally, it is a curious question whether the algebra
structure of Hom(q, q) introduced in Appendix C will
hold for more general lattice spin systems. If this is the
case, then the above discussions can possibly imply gen-
eral mathematical structure of entanglement.

1 ⊗ (1 ⊕ m) = (1 ⊕ m),
m ⊗ (1 ⊕ m) = (1 ⊕ m),
e ⊗ (1 ⊕ m) = (e ⊕ ǫ),
ǫ ⊗ (1 ⊕ m) = (e ⊕ ǫ).

We observe that upon fusion with ﬂuxes, the four topo-
logical charges of the ground states fall into two entangle-
ment sectors. On the right hand side of above equations,
we relabel (1⊕ m) as a and (e⊕ ǫ) with b and view them
as simple objects a, b ∈ I. One can ﬁgure out the fusion
rules between a and b making use of a principle: mov-
ing and fusion commutes. Namely, if we pick m and e,
fuse them as in the bulk, we obtain ǫ. Now we move this
fusion result to the boundary of the cuts and do the par-
tial trace, it becomes b. If instead, we pick m and e, ﬁrst
move them separately to the boundary and do the partial
trace, they become a and b separately. Then we can fuse
a and b. The principle says the ﬁnal results of these two
diﬀerent processes must be the same, i.e., a ⊗ b = b. We
can pick other J ’s and obtain all the fusion rules between
a and b:

a ⊗ a = a, a ⊗ b = b ⊗ a = b, b ⊗ b = a.

These exactly corresponds to the fusion rules of the RepZ2
model, thus we identify a = 0, b = 1. With this identi-
ﬁcation, we directly arrive at the decomposition matrix
(30). Similar arguments apply for calculation of M ma-
trices for more complicated input data. Furthermore, the
topological charges of ground states that are in the same
entanglement sector, when interpreted as bulk quasipar-
ticles, map to the same excitations on the boundary.

These similarities correspond to the mathematical fact
that the functor for partial trace F : Z(C) → C is a
special case of the bulk-to-boundary map F : Z(C) → D
with D satisfying Z(C) ≃ Z(D). It would be interesting
to see the physical meaning of this correspondence.
We note for clarity that our decomposition MJ j ma-
trix is diﬀerent from the tunneling matrices in the con-
text of gapped domain walls studied in ref.35,36. There
j is a boundary excitation in the only the deconﬁned

Appendix A: String-net Model

We brieﬂy review the string-net model14 in this ap-
pendix. The input data {I, d, δ, G} to deﬁne the model
comes from a unitary fusion category C.
The model is deﬁned on a trivalent graph on a closed
oriented surface. Degrees of freedom live on links of the
graph. For each link, we assign a string type j ∈ I =
{j = 0, 1, ..., N}, where I is called the label set. In the
case of lattice gauge theories, j’s label the irreducible
representations of a group. More generally, they can la-
bel irreducible representations of quantum groups. The
Hilbert space is spanned by all conﬁgurations of the la-
bels on links. Each label j has a “conjugate” j∗ ∈ I,
satisfying j∗∗ = j. There is unique “vacuum” label j = 0
with 0∗ = 0. We require the state to be the same if one
reverses the direction of one link and replaces the label
j by j∗, which is a graphical realization of time reversal
symmetry.

We associate to each string type a number dj called
quantum dimension of j, and deﬁne the total quantum
dimension to be D = Pj d2
j . We further assign to each
three string types a tensor δijk which speciﬁes the branch-
ing rules of a trivalent graph. If for some i, j, k ∈ I one
has δijk = 1, then the three string types are allowed to
meet at a vertex. Otherwise their meeting is not ener-
getically favored, i.e., we will have charge excitations on
the corresponding vertex.

Given the quantum dimensions and fusion rules, we
deﬁne the symmetrized 6j-symbols, often denoted as
G. They are complex numbers satisfying the following

conditions24:

nk∗l∗ = Gklm∗
mns∗ Gjs∗n

mls∗ ,

δmlqδk∗ip,

where the ﬁrst condition speciﬁes tetrahedral symmetry,
the second the pentagon identity, and the third orthogo-
nality condition. The number αj is the Frobenius-Schur
indicator. In the example of lattice gauge theories, this
indicator tells whether the representation j is real, com-
plex, or pseudoreal.
In this case, dj = αjdim(j) with
dim(j) the corresponding dimension of the space of the
representation j; and the tensor Gijm
kln the (symmetrized)
Racah 6j symbol for the group. In this example, string-
net model can be mapped to the Kitaev’s quantum dou-
ble model.

There are two types of local operators that are used
to specify the Hamiltonian. On every vertex v, we have
Qv = δijk acting on the labels of three edges incoming
to the vertex v. On every plaquette p, we have Bs
p with
s ∈ I. It acts on the boundary edges of the plaquette p,
and has the matrix elements on a triangle plaquette24,

Given the

input data of

string-net model
{I, d, δ, G}, one can deﬁne a ﬁber tensor category
F (I, d, δ, G), where
(1) Objects are vector bundles over L, speciﬁed by n :
I → N, with N the set of non-negative integers. An
object in the category is {Cnj}j∈L.

(2) Morphisms f : m → n are sets of linear maps
{fj : Cmj → Cnj}j∈L. We denote the hom space

11

(the set of all morphisms mapping m to n)
Hom(m, n) = ⊕j∈LM atnjmj and abbreviate it by
M atnm.

(5) There are further consistency conditions needed to
be satisﬁed which are given by the normalized 6j-
symbols G as in the Appendix A.

Consider an example from the Fibonacci category. The
label set is I = {0, 1} (or {1, τ} in usual notation), all
the strings are self-dual and the nontrivial fusion rule is
δ110 = δ111 = 1.

Let us consider an object corresponding to Q = ⊕j∈I j,
denoted by q : I → {1}. Intuitively, this is assigning to
both j = 0, 1 a “ﬁber” C. The simple object correspond-
ing to q is {C}j∈L. The tensor product of morphisms
is

2. Proof of Lemma (2)

Proofs are based on ﬁber fusion category Appendix B.

1. Proof of Lemma (1)

To prove eq.(8), consider an algebra of Hom(q, q) with

multiplication “·” given by

(f · g)j = tr ((f ⊗ g)j) .

Then α · α = α. Furthermore, the trace becomes

trβj = tr(cid:0)Pj(cid:0)α·L(cid:1)(cid:1) = αj.(cid:3)

The identity to be proved is eq.(9). Using Lemma (1)
d2
D = 1, the proof simpliﬁes to
i

and also the identity Pi

the veriﬁcation of

tr(cid:18)⊕i

D

βi log βi(cid:19) − tr (β0 log β0) = 0.

Since L ≥ 2, we can rewrite β = σ ⊗ α, where σ =

α⊗(L−1). Then the above equation becomes,

Here in the second equality we have used the condi-
tion that the pairs i, k satisfying δjk0∗ = 1 also satisﬁes
δ0k∗j∗ = δk∗0j∗ = δj0k = 1. Thus j = k∗. Lemma (1)

and the identity Ddj = Pik didkδikj∗ are also used in

the derivation. (cid:3).
