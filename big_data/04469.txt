Abstract

We investigate the qualitative features of binary black hole shadows using the model of two

extremally charged black holes in static equilibrium (a Majumdar–Papapetrou solution). Our

perspective is that binary spacetimes are natural exemplars of chaotic scattering, because they

admit more than one fundamental null orbit, and thus an uncountably-inﬁnite set of perpetual

null orbits which generate scattering singularities in initial data. Inspired by the three-disc model,

we develop an appropriate symbolic dynamics to describe planar null geodesics on the double black

hole spacetime. We show that a one-dimensional (1D) black hole shadow may constructed through

an iterative procedure akin to the construction of the Cantor set; thus the 1D shadow is self-similar.

Next, we study non-planar rays, to understand how angular momentum aﬀects the existence and

properties of the fundamental null orbits. Taking slices through 2D shadows, we observe three

types of 1D shadow: regular, Cantor-like, and highly chaotic. The switch from Cantor-like to

regular occurs where outer fundamental orbits are forbidden by angular momentum. The highly

chaotic part is associated with an unexpected feature: stable and bounded null orbits, which exist
around two black holes of equal mass M separated by a1 < a < √2a1, where a1 = 4M/√27. To
show how this possibility arises, we deﬁne a certain potential function and classify its stationary

points. We conjecture that the highly chaotic parts of the 2D shadow possess the Wada property.

Finally, we consider the possibility of following null geodesics through event horizons, and chaos in

the maximally-extended spacetime.

INTRODUCTION

In the near future, astronomers aim to view the ‘shadow’ of a black hole for the ﬁrst time.
The Event Horizon Telescope [1, 2], a global network of radio telescopes using long baseline
interferometry [3], will form a high-resolution image of the environment of the centre of our
galaxy. It is anticipated that such images will allow us to directly infer black hole mass, spin
and inclination [4]; to test the no-hair conjecture [5]; and to probe general relativity in the
strong-ﬁeld regime [6–8].

Black holes also occur in binary pairs, as conﬁrmed in spectacular style by the ﬁrst direct
detection of gravitational waves [9, 10]. What kind of shadow is cast by a pair of black holes
in a close orbit? Recent work by Bohn et al. [11] has conﬁrmed that a binary shadow is
qualitatively diﬀerent to a superposition of two singleton shadows. It possesses ‘eyebrow-like’
features, as anticipated by Refs. [12, 13]: partial arcs surrounding the primary shadows. In
fact, as we shall describe here, the (idealised) binary shadow is expected to have self-similar
properties (see e.g. Fig. 1) and thus it may possess, in principle, an inﬁnite hierarchy of
eyebrows. Or, in the words of De Morgan, echoing Swift, “Great ﬂeas have little ﬂeas upon
their backs to bite ’em, and little ﬂeas have lesser ﬂeas, and so ad inﬁnitum.”

Thanks to advances in numerical relativity, it is now possible for specialists to study
realistic binary black hole spacetimes without resort to approximations or surrogate models
[11]. Yet, as our principal aim here is to explore the qualitative features of binary shadows,
we will focus on a simpler closed-form model: a ﬁxed pair of extremally charged black holes.
This is an example of a Majumdar–Papapetrou (MP) geometry, a static solution of the
Einstein–Maxwell equations in which gravitational attraction and electrostatic repulsion are
in balance. The properties of MP geometries were studied in detail by Hartle & Hawking
[14] and Chandrasekhar [15]. Contopoulos revealed that the binary MP spacetime exhibits
self-similarity and chaotic dynamics [16–22]. Inﬂuential perspectives on the role of chaos in
binary systems in relativity have followed from Yurtsever [23], Dettmann [24, 25], Cornish
[26, 27], Frankel [28], Levin [29, 30] and many others [31–35].

The MP class of solutions has two particularly nice properties. First, the line element
(ds2 = gµνdxµdxν) may be written in a standard coordinate system {t, x, y, z} in isotropic
form,

ds2 = −U

(1)
Here, U (x) satisﬁes Laplace’s equation ∇2U = 0, and thus solutions may be generated
by linear superposition. Second, the null geodesics of the geometry are determined by a
Maupertuis principle, as they are the extremal paths of the action functional

−2(x)dt2 + U 2(x)dx · dx.

S =

U 2(x)dl,

dl = √dx · dx =

dx2 + dy2 + dz2 .

(2)

In other words, U 2(x) may be interpreted as a (variable) refractive index. Thus, not only is
this system amenable to standard Lagrangian/Hamiltonian methods, it is also conceivable

that a material system mimicking MP geometries could one day be created in the laboratory.

In the Newtonian context, the problem of two ﬁxed centres (Euler’s three-body problem)
is integrable: the equations governing particle motion are separable in spheroidal coordinates,
and so there arises an additional constant of motion (Whittaker’s constant). By contrast,
the geodesic equations for two ﬁxed black holes are not integrable [15, 16], and we should
anticipate richer phenomena.

In this article we will advance the view that binary black hole shadows are a fascinating
example of chaotic scattering in nature. Chaotic scattering occurs in a wide range of con-
texts, such as chemical reactions, the Newtonian three-body problem, the motion of point
vortices, particle motion in electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and geometric optics [36]. In Eck-
hardt’s deﬁnition [37], scattering in a Hamiltonian system is irregular (or chaotic) if there
exists, on some manifold of initial data, an inﬁnity of distinct ‘scattering singularities’ of
measure zero, typically arranged into a fractal set. A ‘scattering singularity’ is an initial
value for which the scattering process is not deﬁned, and some physical quantity such as
deﬂection angle or time delay becomes singular. In regions of irregular scattering, a small
variation in initial conditions leads to a completely diﬀerent outcome in the scattering pro-
cess. In the case of two ﬁxed black holes, the ‘singularities’ correspond to those light rays
(null geodesics) that asymptote towards perpetual orbits: unstable null orbits which are nei-
ther scattered, nor absorbed by either black hole. An important subset of the perpetual
orbits are the periodic orbits [16, 20, 22]. The ‘fundamental’ periodic orbits in the plane for

hole Majumdar–Papapetrou geometry). N.B. In this coordinate system, the black hole event

horizons appear as points.

two ﬁxed black holes of equal mass are shown in Fig. 2.

The classic exemplar of chaotic scattering is Eckhardt’s three-disc model [38], studied
in detail by Gaspard & Rice [39], in which an incoming particle undergoes perfectly-elastic
collisions with three ﬁxed discs until it escapes towards inﬁnity (see Fig. 3). The qualitative
features of this model may be understood via symbolic dynamics [40]. Each disc may be
assigned a label: 0, 1, or 2. A trajectory is labelled by a sequence of digits, corresponding to
the discs with which it collides. For example, 021 would label a trajectory hitting ﬁrst disc 0,
then disc 2, then disc 1, before escaping from the system. In principle, there are sequences of
arbitrary length. The ‘perpetual’ trajectories, which do not escape the system, are labelled
with an inﬁnite sequence of digits. Among these are ‘asymptotically periodic’ trajectories
with recurring sequences, which are embedded in the former as the rational numbers are
embedded in the reals.

There is an alternative way of labelling trajectories in the three-disc problem [38]. After
each collision, a trajectory can be continued in three ways: we may decide to continue to disc
on the left (0), to disc on the right (2), or out of the system (1). We note that a ‘perpetual’
trajectory corresponds to an inﬁnite ternary sequence which does not feature the digit 1.
Thus, the symbolic representation of perpetual orbits maps directly on to the usual ternary
representation of the Cantor set. To draw a convenient distinction, we shall call the latter
approach decision dynamics, and the approach of the previous paragraph collision dynamics.
Note that in decision dynamics, neighbouring digits are permitted to be the same, whereas
this is forbidden in collision dynamics.

In this article, we shall develop decision dynamics to better understand the binary shadow
problem. The key idea is illustrated in Fig. 4. A geodesic passing around the upper black

a trajectory is encoded by a sequence of digits; there are several ways to do this.

In ‘collision

dynamics’ (our term), this trajectory is 2012, as it collides with the discs in this order. In ‘decision

dynamics’ (our term), the trajectory is 0001 (or left-left-left-out), referring to the ‘decision’ made

after each collision. In this article we apply ‘decision dynamics’ to light rays around a binary black

hole.

hole may continue by passing around the lower black hole in the same sense (0); the lower
black hole in the opposite sense (2); or the upper black hole in the same sense (4).
In
between these possibilities, it may fall into the black hole (1), or escape to inﬁnity (3).

The article is organised as follows. In brief, in Sec. II we consider rays in a plane and one-
dimensional (1D) shadows; in Sec. III we progress to non-planar rays and two-dimensional
(2D) shadows; and in Sec. IV we extend to consider rays through event horizons. We
conclude in Sec. V with a discussion. In more detail, in Sec. II we introduce the Majumdar–
Papapetrou spacetime; derive its geodesic equations in the Hamiltonian formalism (II A);
deﬁne the black hole shadow (II B); explore a 1D shadow associated with the centre of mass
(II C); introduce symbolic dynamics (II D); construct the 1D shadow with a Cantor-like
iterative procedure (II E); and demonstrate chaotic scattering (II F). In Sec. III we study
non-planar null geodesics (III A) for the binary MP spacetime; highlight the existence of
stable bounded null orbits (III A 4); and present a gallery of 2D shadows (III B 1) and their
1D slices (III B 3). In Sec. IV we show how to track geodesics through event horizons (IV A);
and brieﬂy explore shadows in alternative spacetimes (IV B).

Conventions: We use units in which G = c = 1, and the spacetime signature +2. Partial
(covariant) derivatives are denoted with commas (semi-colons). Lowercase Greek letters
(µ, ν, . . .) denote spacetime indices 0 . . . 3, and lowercase Roman letters (i, j, . . .) denote
spatial indices 1 . . . 3. The terms ‘null geodesic’ and ‘light ray’ are used interchangeably.

in a (initially-narrow) congruence passing around the upper black hole faces a choice: it may (0)

pass around the lower black hole in the same sense; or (2) in the opposite sense; or (4) around the

upper black hole in the same sense. Between these cases, it may plunge into the black hole (1), or

escape to inﬁnity (3).

II. PLANAR GEODESICS, 1D SHADOWS AND CHAOTIC SCATTERING

In this section we consider the null geodesics of a double black hole MP spacetime [41]
in standard coordinates {t, x, y, z}, with the black holes placed on the z axis and the centre
of mass at the origin. The line element is given by (1) and electromagnetic vector potential
by Aµ = [U−1(x), 0, 0, 0], where

Here M+ and M− are the black hole masses and x = y = 0, z± = ±aM∓/(M+ + M−)
their positions, with a their (coordinate) separation. The ‘points’ at x = y = 0, z = z±
are actually null surfaces of ﬁnite area, corresponding to the black hole horizons [14]. We
shall consider in particular the equal mass case, with M+ = M− ≡ M and z± = ±a/2. We
commonly use units in which M = 1.

A. Null geodesics

A geodesic is a path in spacetime which extremizes the interval between two events. In

where gµν is the inverse metric. The geodesics are the solutions to Hamilton’s equations:
˙qµ = ∂H/∂pµ and ˙pµ = −∂H/∂qµ. Along geodesics, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
functions are constant, with L = 0 = H in the null case. On the MP spacetime, H =

with similar expressions for the y and z components. Rescaling the constant of motion pt
is equivalent to rescaling the aﬃne parameter λ; thus, we may set pt = −1 in the following
without loss of generality.

cylindrical polar coordinates {t, ρ =(cid:112)

Our geometry is symmetric around the axis connecting the two black holes. Thus, we
should anticipate a conserved azimuthal angular momentum pφ. This is seen most easily in
x2 + y2, φ, z} in which U , and thus H, are indepen-

dent of φ. After setting pt = −1, we have ˙t = U 2,

An advantage of using an aﬃne parameter λ, rather than coordinate time t, to parametrize
geodesics is that we can maximally extend geodesics through event horizons (after a change
of coordinate system; see Sec. IV A). A disadvantage is that we may not so easily follow
congruences of geodesics, as each geodesic in the congruence has its own aﬃne parameter,
whereas t is deﬁned globally in the exterior spacetime. In a static spacetime, this is easily
remedied. A straightforward approach is to apply the chain rule d
dλ to the
equations above. Alternatively, we may restrict to a six-dimensional phase space {pi, qj}
(where i, j = 1, 2, 3) with independent variable t, and introduce the alternative Hamiltonian

We note that, along null geodesics, H(cid:48) = −pt = 1. Now we may use the Legendre
U 2(cid:112)(dx/dt)2 + (dy/dt)2 + (dz/dt)2. It is straightforward to show that X = 1 along null
transformation to obtain the corresponding Lagrangian, L(cid:48) = X(X − 1) where X =

Thus we have reached Eq. (2), the Maupertuis principle.

One may reach the same conclusion in a more direct fashion by noting that the MP

spacetime is conformally related to an ultrastatic spacetime ds2 = −dt2 + U 4dx · dx.

B. Shadows

Here we brieﬂy consider the deﬁnition of a ‘black hole shadow’. Bohn et al. [11] employ a
ray-casting approach, and conceive that “a shadow is a region of the image where geodesics
are traced backwards in time from the camera to a black hole”. The camera device provides
a natural isomorphism between a point on a 2D image, and a null geodesic. A ‘pixel’ on
the image is part of the black hole shadow if and only if the corresponding null geodesic
asymptotically approaches a black hole horizon. In other language, the shadow is the basin
of attraction [24, 25] for the black holes in the initial data.

With a slight change of emphasis, we may draw our shadow on a two-sphere instead.
Let E be a spacetime event (e.g. the opening of a pinhole camera). Around E, construct
a Riemann normal coordinate system [43] with E at the origin. Now consider the two-
surface formed by the intersection of the past light cone of E and the hypersurface t = −.
In the limit  → 0, this is a two-sphere of radius  (N.B. spacetime is locally ﬂat, and
gµν = ηµν + O(x2) in this coordinate system). A point on the sphere is associated with a
null geodesic that passes through the point and is normal to the two-sphere, and outward-
pointing. The point on the sphere is in the shadow if and only if the associated null geodesic
asymptotically approaches a black hole horizon.

Of course, a shadow may be deﬁned with respect to some other initial data surface. For
example, one might consider rays normal to a collimator. We could deﬁne a shadow on
any n-dimensional hypersurface if n < d (where d is the number of spatial dimensions), by
associating points on the hypersurface with null geodesics that are normal to it (and passing
through it the same sense).

Two more general possibilities are not considered here. First, one may wish to deﬁne a
shadow with respect to some null congruence which is not hypersurface-orthogonal. Second,
in the cases above, the initial data surface has an intrinsic geometry; however, it may also
be possible to consider initial data on a manifold without a metric structure.

8

C. A one-dimensional shadow

Let us now examine an example of a 1D shadow, in a highly symmetric scenario. We
shall consider light rays starting at the centre of mass between two ﬁxed black holes of equal
mass M± = 1, separated by a coordinate distance a, and conﬁned to the xz-plane. As initial
data, we use

x = y = z = 0,

py = 0,

px = U 2

0 cos α,

pz = U 2

0 sin α, U0 = 1 +

4M
a

,

(10)

with pt = −1, where α is the initial angle. In other words, we seek the black hole shadow
deﬁned for rays normal to an (inﬁnitessimal) ring surrounding the centre of mass.

As shown in Fig. 5, the fate of the light ray depends on the initial angle α. If α ∼ 0 (or
α ∼ π), the ray will escape to inﬁnity; if α ∼ π/2, the ray will plunge directly into the upper
black hole. With some intermediate value of α, a ray may orbit around the upper hole and
then plunge into the lower hole; or it may pass between the holes and escape to inﬁnity.

We used Mathematica’s function NDSolve to obtain numerical solutions of Eq. (6) with

initial data (10), taking M = 1, a = 2 as default values.

Figure 5 shows the fate of the ray as a function of α. In pioneering work [16], Contopoulos
labelled rays as Type I & II (falling into the upper and lower BHs) and Type III (escaping
to inﬁnity). Here, we use the three similar labels +1 (into upper black hole), −1 (into lower
black hole) and 0 (escape to inﬁnity).

FIG. 5. Examples of null rays emanating from the centre of mass of two equal-mass extremally

charged black holes. Here (a), (b) and (c) denote rays escaping to inﬁnity, falling into the lower

BH, and into the upper BH, respectively. The right plot shows that there are further possibilities

between (a)/(b) and (b)/(c). For example, between (b) and (c) are rays that escape to inﬁnity by

passing between the BHs.

One way of demonstrating that a system is chaotic is through the use of symbolic dy-
namics, which describes the topology of trajectories in phase space [26]. Symbolic dynamics
provides a coordinate-invariant method of characterizing chaos, which is particularly im-
portant when considering scattering problems in general relativity [24, 25]. Furthermore, a
symbolic code allows us to study the dynamics analytically, despite the fact that the geodesic
equations themselves are non-integrable. In the binary black hole system, we are particu-
larly interested in the role played by the (unstable) perpetual orbits, which correspond to
inﬁnitely long symbolic sequences. As we shall see, the initial conditions corresponding to
perpetual orbits can form a Cantor-like set.

We develop the symbolic code by considering a null geodesic in a congruence which has
reached a ‘decision’, as shown in Fig. 4. Faced with a decision, the geodesic may follow a
path around the other black hole in the same sense (0); around the other black hole in the
opposite sense (2); or around the same black hole in the same sense (4). In addition, the
particle could fall into one of the black holes (1), or escape to inﬁnity (3).

One can therefore describe any planar null orbit in the binary MP spacetime using a
base-5 system. Moreover, it is clear that the perpetual orbits can be described by an inﬁnite
sequence of digits from the symbolic alphabet which do not contain the digits 1 or 3, since
they linger in the strong-ﬁeld region without being absorbed by the black holes or escaping
to inﬁnity (by contrast, the rays which are absorbed or scattered are ﬁnite-length sequences
which terminate in 1 or 3). For example, the sequence 000··· corresponds to a geodesic that
orbits both black holes, whilst the sequence 222··· corresponds to the ﬁgure-of-eight orbit.
Additional examples of perpetual orbits in the double black hole spacetime are presented in
Fig. 6. The periodic orbits – which form a subset of the perpetual orbits – are described
in the decision dynamics by recurring sequences; these sequences correspond to rational
numbers. However, a generic perpetual orbit need not be periodic. Thus, the representation
of such orbits will not be a recurring sequence; non-periodic perpetual orbits correspond to
irrational numbers. The use of a base-5 symbolic alphabet in the decision scheme provides
a natural map of perpetual orbits on to the (uncountably inﬁnite) 5-adic Cantor set.

(In an alternative approach, presented by Cornish and Gibbons in Ref. [26], a geodesic
is described by a sequence of digits recording its passage through three ‘windows’ on the
symmetry axis. The three digits −1, 0 and 1 correspond to the open intervals z ∈ (−∞, z−),
(z−, z+), and (z+, +∞), respectively. Recalling the three-disc example [37], we classify this
as a ‘collision dynamics’, as repeated neighbouring digits are prohibited (see Fig. 20). It is
explored further in Appendix A. We prefer to use ‘decision dynamics’ as it provides insight
into the ordering of perpetual orbits in initial data, as we shall describe.)

10

FIG. 6. Above: Examples of asymptotically periodic null orbits that start from the centre of mass.
In our symbolic dynamics, these orbits are given by the recurring sequences 000··· , 0202··· ,
222··· , 444··· (left-to-right). Below: The vertical lines indicate the critical values of the angle
α corresponding to these asymptotically periodic orbits. Due to the Cantor-like distribution of

perpetual orbits on the initial data, any open interval in α contains either zero or an inﬁnite

number of perpetual orbits.

E. Fractal structure of the one-dimensional shadow

1. Ordering of perpetual orbits in the initial data

Let us now apply symbolic dynamics to understand the ordering and organisation of
the perpetual orbits, (i.e. scattering singularities) in an initial data set. Let us begin by
examining the 1D shadow shown in Fig. 7(a), in domain α ∈ [0, π/2], in which we have
highlighted three intervals of interest in pink (left), light blue (middle), and green (right).
Outside of these regions there are no perpetual orbits, but within each of these three intervals
are embedded inﬁnitely many perpetual orbits.

To the left of the pink interval (in initial angle α), all trajectories escape to inﬁnity
[Fig. 5(a)]. Between the pink and light blue intervals, all trajectories fall into the lower
black holes [Fig. 5(b)], and between the light blue and green intervals, all trajectories again
escape to inﬁnity. Finally, to the right of the green interval, all of the trajectories pass into
the upper black hole [Fig. 5(c)].

Now consider what happens when we increase α, starting from the equator α = 0. All
trajectories escape to inﬁnity, until we reach some critical value of α which corresponds
to the ﬁrst perpetual orbit. This orbit is depicted on the left of Fig. 6, and has symbolic
in our decision dynamics. Similarly, let us consider what happens
representation 000···
when we decrease α, starting from the pole α = π/2. As discussed in Sec. II C, all of the
trajectories fall into the upper black hole, until we reach a critical value of α corresponding

FIG. 7. Zooming in on the 1D shadow. These plots show the fate of a null geodesic starting at
the centre of mass with initial angle α (cf. Fig. 5) and M± = 1, a = 2. With the exception of a
measure-zero set (the perpetual orbits), all rays fall in to the upper black hole (BH1), the lower
black hole (BH2), or escape to inﬁnity (∞). Between the pink and blue regions, and blue and green
regions, are open intervals in which all rays share the same fate. Within the pink, blue and green

regions, corresponding to ‘decisions’ 0, 2, and 4 in Fig. 4, there are an inﬁnite number of perpetual

orbits. In plots (b), (e) and (h) we repeatedly ‘zoom in’ on the left (pink, 0) region; in plots (c),

(f) and (i) on the middle (blue, 2) region; and in (d), (g) and (h) the right (green, 4) interval.

Self-similar structure is apparent. A subtlety is that (d), (g) and (j) are similar to (a); whereas (b),

(e) and (h) are repeatedly reﬂected in the x-axis; and (c), (f) and (i) are also repeatedly ﬂipped in

the horizontal sense. These features are explained in the text.

to the ﬁnal perpetual orbit. This orbit is depicted on the right of Fig. 6, and it corresponds
to the sequence 444··· in our symbolic code.

One might infer from the above examples that the ordering in the initial data exactly
matches the ordering of the sequences in our decision dynamics, but this is not quite the
case. To be precise, we now introduce a function F that maps a ‘decision dynamics’ sequence
X = X1X2X3 ··· (where Xi are single digits in base-5, cf. Fig. 4) onto a real number in

only if α(1) < α(2), where X (i) and α(i) are the sequences and initial data for any null rays.

We take F (X) = f ((cid:101)X). Here, f simply maps the digits of a sequence on to the correspond-
a digit (cid:101)Xi in (cid:101)X according to a procedure which keeps track of ‘parity’ P . Working from

ing digits of a real number base 5, in a straightforward way: f (Y1Y2Y3 . . .) = 0.Y1Y2Y3 ··· .
The tilde denotes a parity-reordering operation, in which each digit Xi in X is mapped to

(ii) reverse the parity if Xi = 2 (P → −P ); (iii) iterate, i → i + 1. We note that
the operation is its own inverse (i.e. it is an involution). The geometrical explanation here
is that decision 2 describes a geodesic passing between the black holes (cf. Fig. 4), and this
reverses the sense of the orbit, from clockwise to counter-clockwise and vice versa.

ing the parity-reordering, (cid:101)A = 24202420··· and (cid:101)B = 20242024··· . As 0.20242024··· <

For example, consider the sequences A = 20202020··· and B = 24242424··· . Apply-

0.24202420··· (i.e. F (B) < F (A)) it is clear that the perpetual orbit represented by decision
sequence B will precedes that represented by decision sequence A in the initial data α.

2. Constructing a Cantor-like set on initial data

leaving two closed intervals (cid:2)0, 1

It is well-known that the standard Cantor set may be constructed by an iterative proce-
3),

dure. Starting with the (closed) unit interval [0, 1], one removes the open middle third ( 1

3, 1(cid:3). Next, one removes the open middle third of

3, 2

(cid:3) and (cid:2) 2

3

the remaining closed intervals, continuing in this fashion ad inﬁnitum until left with a set
of points which were not removed from the unit interval at any step. These points make
up the Cantor set: a one-dimensional self-similar fractal. One may construct other types
of Cantor set by removing more than one interval; and/or by changing the proportionate
width of the interval(s) removed.

With symbolic dynamics as our guide, we may develop a similar iterative procedure

corresponding to a perpetual orbit, with X an inﬁnite sequence of ‘decisions’ and (cid:101)X the
to construct the 1D shadow on the initial data set α. Let α(cid:101)X denote an initial value

parity-reordered sequence which determines its order in the initial data (see Sec. II E 1).
We begin by focussing on the ‘interesting’ interval C = [α ˙0, α ˙4], where an overdot denotes
inﬁnite recurrence (i.e. α ˙0 = α000···). From this interval we may remove two open intervals,
O1 = (α0 ˙4, α2 ˙0) and O3 = (α2 ˙4, α4 ˙0), corresponding to geodesics that immediately fall into
the (lower) black hole or escape to inﬁnity, respectively. O1 forms part of the shadow. Now
we may iterate this procedure on each closed interval that remains. Iterating is equivalent

13

to following the geodesics that linger in the vicinity of the black holes until they reach the
next decision point.

[α(cid:101)X ˙0, α(cid:101)X ˙4], where (cid:101)X is a (parity-reordered) sequence with k digits. To iterate we next remove
Suppose we have iterated k times, and are now considering the closed interval C(cid:101)X ≡
the open intervals O(cid:101)X1 and O(cid:101)X3, where O(cid:101)X1 ≡ (α(cid:101)X0 ˙4, α(cid:101)X2 ˙0) and O(cid:101)X3 ≡ (α(cid:101)X2 ˙4, α(cid:101)X4 ˙0), We
add O(cid:101)X1 to the shadow, and continue.
We note that O(cid:101)X1 and O(cid:101)X3 are the open intervals of initial data corresponding to null
count the number of digits n in the sequence (cid:101)X that are not equal to 4; if n is even (odd),

geodesics that go through a decision sequence X before falling into the black hole, or escaping
to inﬁnity, respectively. In the former case, to determine which black hole is selected, we

the geodesic falls into the lower (upper) black hole.

After k iterations, we have partitioned the initial data into 3k − 1 open intervals
{{O1, O3},{O01, O03, O21, O23, O41, O43},···}, corresponding to geodesics that make up to
k − 1 decisions before falling into the black hole or escaping, and 3k closed intervals corre-
sponding to geodesics that linger long enough around the black holes to make k decisions,
and yet whose ultimate fate has not been determined at this level of precision. As k → ∞,
one is left with an inﬁnite number of closed sets of zero measure – a structure isomorphic
to the 5-adic Cantor set – and an inﬁnite number of open sets which are isomorphic to its

complement. The black hole shadow is the union of the open sets O(cid:101)X1, where X is any

sequence without the digits 1 or 3.

In principle, at each stage the ratio of the widths of the two open intervals removed to
the closed interval in which they are embedded will depend on the entire prior history of
the geodesic motion; and thus, on all the preceding digits in its symbolic representation.
In practice, the ratios will depend principally on the most recent decision taken (i.e. the
previous digit in the sequence), and the eﬀect of dependence on previous decisions (earlier
digits) is exponentially suppressed. Thus, we expect the structure that arises to be clearly
self-similar, as we conﬁrm in the next section.

3. Demonstrating self-similarity in the one-dimensional shadow

Having developed a symbolic code based on decision dynamics, we now use it to under-
stand the fractal properties of the 1D shadow. It is clear from the 1D shadow plot presented
in Fig. 7(a) that there are three open intervals in which we see rich fractal structure. By
zooming in on these intervals successively, we will conﬁrm that the shadow is self-similar.

Let us ﬁrst examine the leftmost interval of the 1D shadow plot, which is highlighted in
pink, to obtain Fig. 7(b). Zooming in on this region once is equivalent to making decision 0.
We see that this image is qualitatively very similar to Fig. 7(a). In fact, the image is identical
except for the trajectories which fall into the upper and lower black holes are exchanged.
Zooming in on the left-hand interval again – i.e. making decision 0 once more – we obtain

14

Fig. 7(e), which is similar to Fig. 7(a). Finally, at the next level of zoom, presented in
Fig. 7(h), we see that again upper and lower black holes are exchanged; we obtain an image
which is identical to Fig. 7(b).

Similarly, we may zoom in on the middle interval (highlighted in light blue in Fig. 7(a)).
This is equivalent to repeatedly taking decision 2. Three successive levels of zoom are
displayed in Fig. 7(c), Fig. 7(f) and Fig. 7(i), respectively. We observe that, at each level,
the trajectories which fall into the upper and lower black holes are again interchanged.
Furthermore, the image is mirrored in α about the centre of the interval (N.B. decision 2
reverses the sense of the orbit).

Finally, we may zoom in on the right-hand interval (green) by repeatedly taking decision
4; this yields Fig. 7(d), Fig. 7(g) and Fig. 7(j). We see that each plot is similar to the
original.

In Fig. 7(a)–(j) we have zoomed in on the same region repeatedly, that is, followed
geodesics which make the same decision at each stage. Zooming in on the intervals in this
fashion yields a particular class of self-similar images: those in which the proportions of
the intervals corresponding to each trajectory type are the similar at each level of zoom.
However, if we were to take diﬀerent decisions at each stage, we would still observe self-
similarity, but with the relative proportions of the intervals depending, principally, on the
previous digit in the decision sequence.

F. The strange repellor and chaotic scattering

The set of all (unstable, unbound) trajectories that remain conﬁned in the scattering
region as t → ∞ constitutes the repellor ΩR of the scattering system [39]. In a two-disc
model, the repellor consists of a unique trajectory. The associated dynamics are regular,
and the Kolmogorov–Sinai (KS) entropy is zero; thus, the repellor is regular. By contrast,
the repellor for the three-disc system forms a Cantor-like set (i.e. an uncountably inﬁnite
set with fractal properties) [37, 39]; this is called an irregular (or strange) repellor. In the
previous sections, we have shown that a strange repellor ΩR also exists for null geodesics on
the double black hole MP spacetime, and it is also a Cantor-like set.

Gaspard & Rice [39] showed that the repellor ΩR, and the natural measure it supports,
are characterized by quantities such as the Lyapunov exponents (λi), the KS entropy per
unit time (hKS), the Hausdorﬀ dimension (DH) and the information dimension (DI), the
escape rate (γ) and the time-delay function (T ). Here we brieﬂy illustrate the latter.

Figure 8 shows the time delay function T (α), deﬁned here as the coordinate time it takes
for a null geodesic starting at the centre of mass to reach some large radius r1. Note that T (α)
is not deﬁned for trajectories that fall into the black holes, as t diverges in the approach to
an horizon. In addition, T diverges in the approach to a scattering singularity – not because
it approaches an horizon, but because it (asymptotically) approaches a perpetual orbit. Like

15

the 1D shadow, the time-delay function has a self-similar geometry. In these respects, it is
similar to the time delay function for the three-disc model shown in Fig. 2 of Ref. [39] (see
also Fig. 2 in Ref. [36] for the deﬂection angle).

FIG. 8. Time delay for scattering from the two black hole system. The plot shows the coordinate

time it takes a null geodesic starting at the centre of mass to escape to large radius. In the blank

regions, the geodesics fall into the black holes and the function is not deﬁned. The right plot shows

a close-up of the red region in the left-plot, highlighting the self-similarity of this function.

III. NON-PLANAR RAYS AND BINARY SHADOWS

In Sec. III A we study rays with non-zero angular momentum about the symmetry axis. In
Sec. III B we present a gallery of two-dimensional shadows, which we analyze by examining
1D slices.

A. Non-planar rays

Let us now consider non-planar motion governed by system (7), with a non-zero conserved
azimuthal angular momentum pφ. Once again, it is rewarding to consider the fundamental
perpetual null orbits (cf. Fig. 2). Where two or more (distinct-but-connected) fundamental
null orbits exist, we expect chaotic scattering to occur (i.e. a Cantor-like set of scattering
singularities in initial data). However, we shall see that there are other possibilities.

1. Fundamental orbits with angular momentum

Figure 9 shows examples of non-planar fundamental null orbits for pφ = 1, a = 2. The
fundamental orbits of Fig. 2 persist, keeping their distinct character, even though the motion
is no longer planar. The three fundamental orbits (with decision sequences (a) 000··· , (b)

16

t/M0.4450.47250.5αt/M0.450.45150.453α222··· , (c) 444··· ) are shown, along with the alternating case (d) 0202··· . The latter
case (d) indicates that transitions between the fundamental orbits are possible, just as in
the planar case, and thus there will exist an inﬁnite family of perpetual orbits. Though the
motion in the ρz-plane is periodic, the non-commensurate motion in φ means that these
geodesics are not closed in 3D; instead they trace out a two-surface [left plots].

version of the second plot in Fig. 6, with decision sequence 0202··· . The yellow line is the contour

Here we have introduced the function

h(ρ, z) ≡ ρU 2

(12)

(13)

that determines the sign of the right-hand side of Eq. (12), via the term in square brackets.
The contours of h (i.e. the solutions to h(ρ, z) = pφ) are curves on which a ray may be
instantaneously stationary in the ρz-plane (as pρ = 0 = pz and thus ˙ρ = 0 = ˙z). For a
given pφ, the contour h(ρ, z) = pφ demarcates a ‘forbidden’ region that a null ray cannot
access; for pφ (cid:54)= 0 this region includes all of the symmetry axis, with the possible exception
of z = z±.

For a ray which ‘touches’ a contour C (deﬁned by h = pφ), with ˙ρ = 0 = ˙z, Hamilton’s
equations are ˙pρ|C = 1
ρh,z. Consequently, rays that ‘touch’ a contour of h must
be incident parallel to ∇h, and thus orthogonal to the contours of h. This feature can be
seen in Fig. 9 (note that in case (d) we have conﬁrmed that the ray does not quite touch
the contour).

ρh,ρ, ˙pz|C = 1

Figure 10 shows the eﬀect of increasing pφ on the fundamental orbits, for the case a = 2.
We see that the ˙0 and ˙2 trajectories move closer together as pφ is increased. At a critical

3. Stationary points of h

Figures 11(a) and 11(b) indicate that the morphology of the contours of h depends on
the separation of the black holes a. For large a, the system behaves as two distinct black
holes; whereas for small a the system can eﬀectively to resemble a single, distorted black
hole. To better understand this, we should consider the stationary points of h. In Fig. 11(a)
[a = 2], h has a pair of saddle points associated with each black hole separately, above and
below the equatorial plane; whereas in Fig. 11(b) [a = 0.5], h has saddle points only in the
equatorial plane. Perpetual orbits of type ˙4 are clearly not possible in the latter case.

We may understand the system more fully by classifying the stationary points of h

[Eq. (13)] that lie in the equatorial plane (z = 0). Let us deﬁne

a1 = 4M/√27 ≈ 0.769800M,

a2 = √2 a1 ≈ 1.088662M.

(a) pφ = 4.

(b) pφ = 5.

(c) pφ = 5.08.

(d) pφ = 5.9.

FIG. 10. Examples of non-planar fundamental orbits for a = 2 and pφ > 0. The blue curves are
null trajectories, and the yellow curve shows h = pφ. As pφ increases, the ˙0 and ˙2 orbits move
closer together. Beyond pφ ≈ 5.08, these orbits do not exist. The ˙4 orbit [without symmetry in the
equatorial plane] exists up to pφ ≈ 5.92214. The consequences for chaotic scattering are explored
in the text.

For a > a2, there are no stationary points on the equatorial plane. For a = a2 there is
a cusp along the ρ-axis (pointing inwards) at ρ = √5a/2 (N.B. the cusp corresponds to a
point of inﬂexion in the ρ direction and a maximum in the z direction). For a1 < a < a2
there are two stationary points: a saddle point at ρ = ρ+ and a maximum at ρ = ρ−, where
ρ+ > ρ− > a/√2. For a < a1, the stationary points at ρ+ and ρ− are saddle points, such
that ρ+ > a/√2 > ρ−.

The separation a = 1 is a special case: one contour connects three saddle points, as
shown in Fig. 10(d). Remarkably, the contour value and the saddle point positions can be
2(1 + √5). The saddle points at
written in closed form in terms of the Golden Ratio, ϕ ≡ 1
251/4ϕ−1/2, z = ±1/(2ϕ) are connected by a single contour
ρ = 1
255/4ϕ3/2. This contour encloses a maximum at ρ = √3/2, z = 0 with
of height h = 1
h = 9√3/2.

251/4ϕ3/2, z = 0 and ρ = 1

The saddle points of h may be thought of as unstable ‘Lagrange points’ for null rays in
the system. We note that, wherever there are saddle points, there are also neighbouring
contours (of equal height) on either side of the saddle which are almost parallel. As null
rays intersect the contours orthogonally, it seems that, generically, (unstable) null orbits will
occur between such neighbouring contours. Fig. 10(d) shows a speciﬁc example.

by a black hole would require the ray to pass through a narrow throat.

4. Bounded orbits

Intriguingly, the existence of a maximum of h ≡ ρU 2 for a1 < a < a2 implies the
existence of stable bounded null geodesics which are conﬁned to a compact region of the
ρz-plane. For pφ > pc
φ, this region is completely inaccessible to scattering trajectories that
encroach from ρ → ∞. An example of a bounded null geodesic is shown in Fig. 13. To our
knowledge, bounded null geodesics have not been observed in a binary model before; they
will be investigated in detail in a forthcoming work.

By decreasing pφ slightly from pc

φ, one may construct a ‘pocket’ in the ρz-plane which
is connected to the black holes horizons and to spatial inﬁnity by narrow throats. An
example of this case for a = 1 is shown in Fig. 14. Qualitatively diﬀerent chaotic dynamics
is associated with this feature, and the ‘decision dynamics’ of Sec. II is not a suitable
framework. Furthermore, for a < 1, it is possible to connect the pocket to the black holes,
without also connecting to inﬁnity. For a > 1, the pocket may be connected to inﬁnity,
without connecting to the black holes.

We recall that the potential for the H´enon-Heiles system [44], V (x, y) = 1

2(x2 + y2) +
x2y − 1
3y3, also has a single contour Vc = 1/6 connecting three saddle points. Thus, for
Hamiltonian values H = Vc + , the H´enon-Heiles system also has a pocket with three

in the cylindrical-

of h (i.e. a stable circular orbit in the equatorial plane). On the equatorial plane, a maximum

throats. It has been shown [45] that this system exhibits the Wada property (cf. the Lakes
of Wada, described by K. Yoneyama in 1917 [46]): any point on the boundary of one basin
of attraction is also on the boundaries of the other two basins [47–49]. It has been argued
that the Wada property is a general feature associated with compact regions of phase space
with three or more escapes [45, 48, 49]. We anticipate that our ‘pocket’ system will inherit
this property; however, this remains to be investigated.

B. Two-dimensional shadows

through a planar surface with its central point at ρ0, z0, where(cid:112)

Let us now turn our attention to the 2D shadow cast by a pair of black holes in the MP
spacetime. We deﬁne the shadow with respect to a null congruence passing orthogonally
0 = rmax (typically,
we use rmax = 50M ). We deﬁne the angle of incidence via sin θ = ρ0/rmax, cos θ = −z0/rmax.

1. A gallery of shadows

Figure 15 shows the shadows cast by a pair of black holes separated by a = 2 for various
values of the incidence angle θ (measured from the negative z-axis in the anticlockwise
direction). Regions coloured purple (green) correspond to the shadow of the lower (upper)
black hole. We see that, as anticipated, the shadow of a binary system is not simply the
superposition of two singleton shadows, but rather that each black hole has primary shadow
– either ring-shaped or globular – as well as a hierarchy of secondary features.

22

Rays falling into the lower (upper) black hole are shown in purple (green).

As the angle of incidence in Fig. 15 increases, the shadow is distorted but remains qualita-

tively similar to the θ = 0◦ case until we reach θ ∼ 50◦. Here, we clearly see the eyebrow-like
features [12] for the ﬁrst time. When the angle of incidence is equal to 70◦, the green ring-
shaped feature has split into two distinct regions; one of which forms the main shadow cast
by the upper black hole, whilst the other turns into an eyebrow as we continue to increase

In the case θ = 90◦, in which we regard the system from “side on”, we observe two main
globular shadows of equal size and shape, as well as a Cantor-like hierarchy of self-similar
eyebrows around the main shadow (see Fig. 1 for a close-up). This case was also shown in
Fig. 2 of Yumoto et al. [13].

2. On-axis: the θ = 0◦ case

The ﬁrst frame of Fig. 15 depicts the shadow of binary system as seen from the negative
z-axis (0◦). By symmetry, the θ = 0◦ shadow may be constructed from the area of revolution
of the 1D shadow. Figure 16 shows a family of null rays, sent towards the two black holes
from inﬁnity, initially parallel to the z-axis, with impact parameter b.

FIG. 16. The shadow as viewed along the symmetry axis for a = 2. The 2D shadow is the area

of revolution of the 1D shadow, by symmetry. Geodesics on an initial data surface are labelled by

their impact parameter. Once again, decision dynamics can be used to order the perpetual orbits

in the initial data .

Let us consider the crude features of Fig. 16 as b is increased from zero. Near b ∼ 0, all
rays fall into the lower black hole, generating a purple disc in the centre of the 2D shadow.
Next comes a ‘gap’, corresponding to rays that pass between the holes and escape; followed
by a green ring in b in which geodesics fall into the upper black hole; next, a secondary gap
and an outer purple ring. Beyond a certain impact parameter, all rays escape to inﬁnity.

This crude description above overlooks the self-similar properties of the shadow. Let us
construct this shadow using decision dynamics (cf. Fig. 4, Sec. II E 1 & II E 2). The edge

the shadow to sequence 444··· . Embedded in the initial data set are an inﬁnite number of
impact parameters bX which correspond to perpetual orbits. For these values, the scattering
process is singular. Here X is any non-terminating decision sequence in base-5 without the
digits 1 or 3. The ordering of bX in the initial data set is once again determined by F (X)
(Sec. II E 1), but here with the ordering reversed (this can be achieved by redeﬁning the

parity-reversal(cid:101) operation to begin with P = −1). The 1D shadow may be constructed

iteratively, just as in Sec. II E 2, and thus it has Cantor-like properties, which are inherited
by the 2D shadow.

3. 1D slices of 2D shadows

We may inspect the θ = 90◦ case by decomposing it into a family of 1D shadows of
constant pφ. Each value of pφ corresponds to a horizontal slice, running across the image
plane. Some examples of 1D slices of 2D shadows are shown in Fig. 17.

In the a = 2 case, we note that 1D slices taken across the middle of the shadow possess
the now-familiar Cantor-like fractal structure. However, certain 1D slices for large pφ (across
the top of the shadow) do not exhibit fractal structure. Instead, these 1D shadows have well-
deﬁned sharp edges. This behaviour was anticipated from Fig. 10. Figure 10(d) shows a value
of pφ for which ‘exterior’ null orbits ( ˙0 and ˙2) are forbidden. Though two ‘interior’ orbits ( ˙4)
remain possible (permitting absorption to occur), these interior orbits no longer dynamically
connected to each other. In other words, transitions (‘decisions’) are not possible, and thus
chaotic scattering does not occur.

In the a = 1 case (Fig. 17(d)), the 1D slices for larger pφ show highly chaotic behaviour,
which is not eﬀectively described by our ‘decision dynamics’ approach. The highly chaotic
behaviour is associated with the ‘pocket’ feature shown in Fig. 14 (and thus, indirectly, with
the existence of bounded null orbits, Fig. 13).

4. Varying the separation a

Clearly then, there are important qualitative diﬀerences in the shadows for the a = 1 and
a = 2 cases. In fact, such diﬀerences may be anticipated from Figs. 11 and 12 (and text),
where we highlighted a ‘phase change’ in the behaviour of null orbits as the black holes are
brought together. This was understood using a classiﬁcation of stationary points of h in the
equatorial plane, which highlighted the critical values a1 and a2 in Eq. (14).

Figure 18 shows the shadow cast by MP binaries separated by a = 0.5, 1 and 2 (noting
that 0.5 < a1, a1 < 1 < a2 and a2 < 2). Plot 18(d) shows a close-up of the upper ‘fronds’
of the shadow in the a = 1 case. This provides another view of the qualitatively diﬀerent
chaotic behaviour associated with Fig. 14. We speculate that the upper frond will exhibit the

IV. EXTENSIONS

In this section we brieﬂy explore two possible extensions to this work: chaotic scattering of
geodesics which pass through the horizons (IV A); and chaotic scattering on other spacetimes
(IV B).

27

A. Through the event horizons

If one is willing to follow null geodesics through the horizons of the binary MP spacetime,

then the chaotic scattering phenomenon becomes even richer.

U 2(dr2 + r2dΩ2) where U = 1 + M/r, may be transformed into the standard Reissner–

The ‘points’ where U → ∞ in the MP spacetime (at x = y = 0, z = z±) are not spacetime
singularities but merely coordinate singularities [14]. The coordinate time diverges towards
these ‘points’ , t → ∞ as U → ∞, but the geodesic aﬃne parameter λ remains regular; as
do curvature invariants such as RαβµνRαβµν. In fact, the U → ∞ ‘point’ is actually a null
surface with ﬁnite area [14].
In the single black hole case, the MP metric in spherical coordinates, ds2 = −U−2dt2 +
Nordstr¨om metric, ds2 = −f (ˆr)dt2 + f−1(ˆr)dˆr2 + ˆr2dΩ2 where f (ˆr) = (1 − M/ˆr)2, by
a straightforward change of variables, ˆr ≡ r + M . Alternatively, one may replace the t
dF/dr ≡ U , giving the line element ds2 = (cid:101)gµνd(cid:101)xµd(cid:101)xν = −U−2dw2± ± dw±dr + U 2r2dΩ2.
coordinate with a retarded (−) or advanced (+) null coordinate, w± ≡ t ± F (r) where
In the {w±, r, θ, φ} coordinate system, the components (cid:101)gµν remain ﬁnite as U → ∞, and
2(cid:101)gµν(cid:101)pµ(cid:101)pν may be used. Employing the w− and w+

thus the standard Hamiltonian H = 1
coordinates, respectively, we may track a null geodesic passing into (−) or out of (+) the
horizon (see Fig. 19(a)).

In the double black hole case, we may proceed as follows. Suppose we wish to track a
null ray passing through the horizon of the lower black hole. We start by changing to a
spherical coordinate system {t, r, θ, φ} centred at x = y = 0, z = z−, so that U (r, θ) =
1 + M−/r + M+/√r2 − 2ar cos θ + a2. Next, we introduce V (r) ≡ 1 + M−/r + M+/a and
the null coordinate w± = t ± F (r) such that dF/dr = V . The line element becomes

hence the Hamiltonian formulation is not singular as r → 0. Thus, we may evolve Hamilton’s
equations through the coordinate singularity.

It is worth stressing that, in the above, we are considering a coordinate patch in which
the event horizon of the lower black hole is at r = 0 and the singularity is represented by a

(b) Periodic ray

FIG. 19. (a) Conformal diagram for a single extremal Reissner–Nordstr¨om black hole. A light ray

with non-zero angular momentum is shown as a red dotted line. Here it passes through a black

hole horizon into region III, then emerges from a white hole horizon into a new region I. (b) An

example of a periodic null ray that passes through black hole horizons (see text).

In the single black hole case M+ = 0 this is a circle of radius M−; the other black hole has
the eﬀect of distorting the circle.

In the case of a single Reissner–Nordstr¨om black hole, it is well-known that null geodesics
may be extended through the (black hole/future) horizon, passing from region I to III as
shown in Fig. 19(a). Once inside region III (r < 0), all null geodesics with non-zero angular
momentum will avoid the timelike singularity, and emerge through a (white hole/past)
horizon into a new asymptotically ﬂat spacetime (region I(cid:48), r > 0).

Similar behaviour is expected in the double black hole case. We may follow a null geodesic
through either black hole horizon, from r > 0 to r < 0 in a coordinate patch centred on
the relevant black hole, by using null coordinate w−, as described above. Nearly all null
geodesics will come to a turning point where ˙r = 0; with the exception of a set of measure
zero, which collide with the singularity. At the turning point, one may switch to the advanced
null coordinate w+ (switching also the momentum p+
r − 2V 2pt), and then follow the
geodesic from r < 0 to r > 0. Once in the exterior, one may switch back to the isotropic
(MP) coordinates. The geodesic may then plunge into the other black hole; fall into the
same black hole again; or escape to inﬁnity. We may follow the geodesic as far as is desired,
by repeating the method above.

r = p−

Figure 19(b) shows that there exist a class of periodic null orbits which pass into, and out
of, black hole event horizons. The red dashed line shows the part of the geodesic that was
evolved using the w± null coordinates; the switch from w− to w+ occurred at the symmetry
point. We take the liberty of using the magnitude of r (e.g. z = |r| cos θ, etc) in order to

29

trajectory is to imagine the horizons as pin holes in a sheet of paper; on passing through
the pinhole we continue the trajectory on the opposite side of the paper, before returning
through the pinhole. This picture is misleading, of course, as the ray emerges into a new
asymptotically ﬂat spacetime each time it emerges from a horizon (see Fig. 19(a)).

B. Other spacetimes

In motivating this work, the MP spacetime was introduced as a surrogate for a spacetime
of physical interest: two black holes in the ﬁnal stages of inspiral and merger. However,
the MP fails as a surrogate in several ways. In a ‘realistic’ binary the black holes are not
signiﬁcantly charged, yet they may be rotating at a signiﬁcant fraction of the Kerr bound;
they orbit around the centre of mass (thus pφ (cid:54)= const); and spiral inwards as they lose energy
to gravitational-wave emission (thus pt (cid:54)= const). Let us now brieﬂy consider alternative
closed-form models and surrogates, not forgetting that Bohn et al. [11] have shown that it
is possible to study geodesics on numerically-generated ‘realistic’ binary spacetimes.

The MP spacetimes are members of more general classes, including: (i) the Israel–Wilson
class [51]; (ii) higher-dimensional MP spacetimes [35]; (iii) the Kastor–Traschen class [52]. In
each of these cases, the black holes are extremally charged. In the latter case, the spacetime
has a positive cosmological constant, which has the eﬀect of pushing the black holes together,
mimicking (to some extent) a head-on collision. Shadows of Kastor–Traschen double black
hole solutions were studied in Refs. [12, 13].

A static spacetime containing two uncharged black holes was ﬁrst studied by Bach and
Weyl in 1922 [53]. In the absence of charge, a “Weyl strut” (a conical deﬁcit angle on the
symmetry axis) is required to keep the black holes apart.

Chaotic behaviour is not limited to binary systems. Of course, multi-black-hole space-
times should exhibit even richer dynamics. But there are also a range of singleton systems
that exhibit chaotic scattering. Chaotic singletons include perturbed or tidally-distorted
black holes [54, 55], boson stars [56], and hairy black hole solutions [57].

V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

Below we outline the main conclusions of this work.

1. Chaotic scattering [36, 37] arises generically when a spacetime admits more than one
(unstable) fundamental null orbit, provided that the fundamental orbits are distinct
but ‘dynamically connected’, such that null rays may transition between the asymp-
totic neighbourhoods of the fundamental orbits. This leads to the existence of an
uncountably-inﬁnite number of distinct perpetual orbits, associated with a fractal set
of scattering singularities in initial data.

30

2. With ‘decision dynamics’, developed here (Fig. 4, Sec. II D), we were able to under-
stand the ordering and organisation of perpetual orbits in initial data for several simple
cases. We showed that the 1D shadow could be constructed through an iterative pro-
cedure, by successively removing open intervals from initial data (Sec. II E 2). This
construction was akin to the usual construction of the Cantor set.

3. In the case of planar motion in the MP spacetime (pφ = 0), there are three distinct
fundamental orbits (Fig. 2). These orbits are ‘dynamically connected’, in the sense
that a ray can transition between them by making a sequence of ‘decisions’. As a
consequence, there arises a 5-adic Cantor set of scattering singularities on initial data,
and the 1D shadow is manifestly self-similar (Fig. 7, Sec. II E 3).

4. In the non-planar case, the number of fundamental orbits varies with angular momen-
tum pφ (Fig. 10). Where there is just one orbit, or where transitions between orbits
are dynamically forbidden, the shadow loses its fractal property (Fig. 17).

5. The character of the non-planar fundamental orbits changes as the black holes move
closer together (Fig. 11). Null orbits about an individual black hole are forbidden
once the black hole separation a is suﬃciently small; these orbits are usurped by a
equatorially-symmetric orbit about the composite system (Fig. 12).

6. Stable bounded null orbits exist for separations a1 < a < a2, where a1 = 4M/√27
and a2 = √2a1 (Sec. III A, Fig. 13). In the nearly-bounded case, a ‘pocket’ develops,
connecting the black holes and spatial inﬁnity via three throats (Fig. 14). Qualitatively
diﬀerent chaotic behaviour is associated with this pocket; its eﬀect is visible in parts
of the black hole shadow (Figs. 17(d) and 18(d)). We speculated that these parts will
exhibit the Wada property [49].

7. In the MP spacetime, null rays can be followed through horizons, and out again, and
thus there arises more radical possibilities for perpetual orbits and chaotic scattering
(Sec. IV A, Fig. 19).

Let us now discuss some possible implications of this work for more realistic binary black

hole systems.

High symmetry of the MP geometry means that one may naturally decompose a 2D
shadow into 1D ‘slices’ of ﬁxed pφ. In 1D shadows, we observed three diﬀerent qualitative
behaviours: (1) well-ordered (Cantor-like) fractal shadows; (2) hard-edged shadows without
any fractal features; and (3) highly chaotic fractal regions (Fig. 17). These behaviours arise
when: (1) there are several distinct-but-connected fundamental null orbits; (2) there is just
one fundamental null orbit, or, multiple null orbits are all isolated; (3) in phase space there
arises a ‘pocket with three throats’ harbouring a ‘randomizing’ region (Fig. 14).

It is an open question whether all three types of behaviour may occur in simulations
of ‘real’ black hole binary shadows. A ﬁrst investigation of this question might start with

31

inspection of a representative sample of 1D slices from the shadows recently presented by
Bohn et al. [11].

The highly chaotic behaviour (Fig. 17, Fig. 18(d)) was not anticipated. It only occurs for
a limited range of black holes separations, a1 < a < a2. Within this regime, there exists a
family of stable bounded null geodesics (Fig. 13). To the best of our knowledge, bounded null
geodesics have not previously been found in black hole binary systems, or their surrogates
(Sec. IV B). Of course, it may be that bounded null geodesics are a special feature of MP
spacetimes, relating to their high symmetry. Nevertheless, in light of this work, it may prove
fruitful to conduct a more systematic search for stable bounded null geodesics in black hole
binaries and their surrogates [52, 53]; as well as in singleton systems such as perturbed black
holes [54, 55], boson stars [56], and hairy black hole solutions [57].

Appendix A: Translation between symbolic codes

Given a sequence in the collision dynamics presented by Cornish and Gibbons, we would
like to be able to translate to the decision dynamics language. This can be achieved through
the use of the following algorithm. Consider an inﬁnite sequence a1, a2, a3,··· , where ai ∈
{1, 0,−1}, as described by Cornish and Gibbons’s symbolic alphabet. Notice that, in the
decision dynamics, any decision point must be preceded by ±1 in the collision dynamics.
We refer to these as pivot points, as they will be central to the translation between the two
schemes.

Consider the ﬁrst decision point, which follows the pivot point a1 = ±1 in the sequence.
If |a1 − a2| = 2, then a2 = ∓1; that is, a1 and a2 have the opposite sign. In this case we
replace ‘a1’ with ‘0’ in the decision scheme and use a2 as the new pivot point. However, if
|a1 − a2| = 1, then a2 = 0, so we must look at the third element of Cornish and Gibbons’s
sequence. If |a1 − a3| = 2 (i.e. a1 and a3 have the same sign), then replace ‘a1, a2’ with a 2
in the decision dynamics and use a3 as the new pivot point. Alternatively, if |a1 − a3| = 0
(i.e. a1 and a3 have the same sign), then we replace ‘a1, a2’ with a 4 in the decision scheme
and use a3 as the new pivot point. We carry on in the same fashion all the way along the
sequence.

The algorithm can be summarized using the following table. In the table, the leftmost
column represents the pivot point, whilst the central columns correspond to the subsequent

elements of the ﬁnite string we wish to translate. The ﬁnal column gives the correspond-
ing symbol from the decision dynamics alphabet.
In each case, the ﬁnal element of the
subsequence under consideration (which is always ±1) becomes the new pivot point.
