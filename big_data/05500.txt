Abstract

We provide an example for stabilization by noise. Our approach does
not rely on monotonicity arguments due to the presence of higher order
diﬀerential operators or mixing properties of the system as the noise might
be highly degenerate.

In the examples a scalar additive noise destroys a high-dimensional
random attractor of a PDE on an unbounded domain. In the presence
of small noise close to bifurcation all trajectories converge to a single
stationary solution.

Introduction

Our main aim is to provide another example for the stabilization of a random
dynamical system due to noise, which does not seem to ﬁt in the many classes
considered before. We do not rely on monotonicity, as the diﬀerential operators
are higher order. Furthermore, the mixing properties used in other approaches
might fail, as the noise is highly degenerate. We focus in the examples on
equations of the following type

∂tu = Au + νu + f (u) + σ∂tβ,

posed on the whole domain R, d ≥ 1, where we do not assume any decay con-
dition at inﬁnity. The operator A is a non-positive polynomial of the Laplacian
with non-empty kernel. Thus the scalar ν is an explicit measure for the distance
from bifurcation.
The nonlinearity is a function of u with the property that f (u) ∼ −|u|pu for
large u and some p > 0, with the standard example being a stable cubic −u3.
For the noise we assume that it is spatially constant and thus given by a sin-
gle standard real valued Brownian motion β. We comment on other types of
additive noise later on.
noise, where A = −(1 + ∆)2 and f (u) = −u3.

One standard example is the stochastic Swift-Hohenberg with scalar additive

For our main result on stabilization, we exploit directly the structure of the
equation and consider noise suﬃciently larger than the distance from bifurca-
tion, which means for Swift-Hohenberg ν < 3
2 σ2. In that case, we show that any
stationary solution is already globally stable. Due to our special setting, the
stationary solution is spatially constant, and solves an SDE. Thus by the result
of Crauel & Flandoli [9] it is unique among the spatially constant ones, because
of the monotonicity of the one-dimensional system. In conclusion, we cannot
show that arbitrarily small additive noise destroys a pitchfork-bifurcation, but
at least it shifts the bifurcation.

In the general setting, as well as in the example of Swift-Hohenberg, we
cannot rely on monotonicity like in the Allen-Cahn equation considered for
instance by Caraballo, Crauel, Langa & Robinson in [7]. See also the general
results of Chueshov & Vuillermot, [8], or Arnold & Chueshov, [2], or Flandoli,
Gess & Scheutzow, [11], which is a more recent result based on monotonicity.
Here due to the ordering of solutions, one can construct two ergodic stationary
solution that stay ordered which leads to a contradiction. Nevertheless, we use
this result, when we construct spatially constant stationary solutions, as they
satisfy an SDE.

Let us also mention the work of Lamb, Rasmussen et. al., [6], which shows
that additive noise does not destroy a pitchfork-bifurcation, because a phe-
nomenological bifurcation is still present, which can be seen particularly well

2

where the noise is bounded (since in that case, if the random attractor is non
trivial we can actually see it), a case that we do not consider here.

A diﬀerent approach to stabilization was considered by Tearne in [20], where
he showed that suﬃciently small non-degenerate noise in a gradient system given
by an ODE, leads to a trivial random attractor and thus stabilization.

This was recently improved by Flandoli, Gess & Scheutzow [10] to general
SDE systems without any restriction on the noise. They rely mainly on mixing
properties, local stability and “contraction in the large”, in order to show that
the weak random attractor is a single point. Unfortunately, in our examples we
cannot easily resort to a mixing property, as the noise in our examples is highly
degenerate. We can neither prove nor disprove a mixing property for solutions.
A more qualitative approach to stabilization using amplitude equations was
presented by Klepel, Mohammed & Bl¨omker in [16]. For the Swift-Hohenberg
equation with ν = O(ε2), σ = O(ε) and ν < 3
2 σ2 they showed that, for suﬃ-
ciently small ε, the dynamics is qualitatively described by a stable deterministic
ODE. This is the same condition we consider in our paper here, but we do not
need any asymptotics for ε → 0, and we can consider large σ and ν. Moreover,
we present here an almost sure result for t → ∞, while [16] stated stabilization
only with high probability and on ﬁnite time-scales of order ε−2.
Let us also mention the upper semi-continuity of random attractors in the
limit noise to zero (i.e. σ → 0). This does not apply here, as in all the examples
provided we can only study the joint limit σ → 0 and ν → 0, in order to stay
in the regime where the stabilization holds.

The existence of pull-back random attractors has been extensive studied
by many authors for several kinds of SPDEs deﬁned on bounded domain (see,
e.g.
[12, 14, 13]). For the unbounded domain case, the situation becomes
much more complicated, and we need to deal with more diﬃculties caused by
the unboundedness of the spacial domain.
In an unbounded domain, typical
Sobolev embeddings are not compact and the spaces Lp(RN ) are not nested,
adding to the technical diﬃculties. Bates, Lu & Wang [17] introduced the
tail estimates’ technique to obtain compactness, and the existence of pull-back
random attractor has been studied by the same authors in several publication,
e.g. [21, 19, 23, 22]. Moreover, the usual Sobolev spaces do not include the
constant functions and travelling waves, so to be able to include these special
solutions (e.g. equilibria and relaxation waves) in the attractor, they consider
in [3] weighted spaces.

The results of this paper concern the existence of random attractors. For
that purpose in Section 4 we follow the ideas of the already cited [3], where the
authors show the existence of tempered random attractors at least for parabolic
equations of second order in weighted spaces. In a short Section 5 we discuss
the size of the deterministic attractor, which is high-dimensional. The key
stabilization result is presented in Section 6 in Theorem 6.2 where we also discuss
the explicit examples and more general noise terms (see Theorem 6.5).

In the ﬁrst part of the paper, we begin providing the deﬁnition of spaces
and some key technical estimates in Section 2, and the basic setting of the
problem, the deﬁnition of random dynamical systems and attractors as well as
the properties of spatially constant stationary solutions in Section 3.

2 Spaces and Estimates
We consider for ρ > 0 and p ≥ 1 the weighted spaces Lp

ρ with norm

(cid:90)

R

(cid:107)u(cid:107)p
Lp
ρ

=

ρ(x)|u(x)|pdx ,

for a suﬃciently strong polynomial weight of the type

ρ(x) = (1 + |cx|2)−ρ/2

and some small c > 0.

Note that by a slight abuse of notation, we identify the weight ρ : R → (0, 1]
with the scalar decay exponent ρ > 0. An important feature of these spaces is
that Lp
ρ contains not only constant functions, but also functions unbounded at
inﬁnity.

A simple calculation veriﬁes the following properties of the weight:

|ρ(cid:48)(x)| ≤ C1ρ(x)

and |ρ(n)(x)| ≤ Cnρ(x) .

In these estimates we can make the constants Cn as small as we want, by
choosing c close to 0, as Cn ∼ cn. Moreover, it is easy to check that the weight
is integrable (i.e. ρ ∈ L1(R)) if and only if ρ > 1.

We will also use the H k

ρ spaces of functions with square integrable derivatives
up to order k. The norm in these spaces is given by the sum of all L2
ρ norms of
the function and all derivatives up to order k. Note that by the structure of the
weight u ∈ H k

ρ · u ∈ H k(R).

numerical range of the Swift-Hohenberg operator in L2

Proof. First we prove the estimate for a function v which is compactly supported
and smooth. Then we extend the result by continuity to H 2
ρ , where we use the
fact that the bilinear form of −(1 + ∂2
x)2 can be rewritten (using integration by
parts) to depend only on second derivatives.

Note that we can choose C2 as small as we want by ﬁxing c > 0 in the deﬁnition

We focus for simplicity of presentation on the one-dimensional stochastic Swift-

Let us consider the stochastic equation

on R where

• A is a nice diﬀerential operator given by −(1 + ∂2

x)2 + ν for some ν ∈ R
measuring the distance from bifurcation. Note that A is not monotone.
Denote by λ = A1 the action of A on the constant. Here λ = −1 + ν.

• f (u) = −u3 is a polynomial nonlinearity
• β is a real-valued Brownian motion and σ ≥ 0 the noise strength.

Remark 3.1. Let us comment on some generalizations. See also Section 4.6
and the discussion before Theorem 6.5.

• There is nothing special about the choice of A. We could use any parabolic
diﬀerential operator of even order close to bifurcation, later in the exam-
ples we also study A = −∂4
x. If it is of second order, we could rely on
monotonicity.

• For f : R → R we can use any diﬀerentiable function such that for |u|

suﬃciently large we have f (u) ∼ −|u|pu and f(cid:48)(u) ≤ C.

• Noise not acting on the constant or higher dimensional noise is not a
trivial modiﬁcation, as the stationary solution z deﬁned below is no longer
a scalar valued quantity. We need spectral information about the linear
stability of the random operator L + Df (z). Later in Section 6 we also
formulate a result (Theorem 6.5) for the general noise case at least in the
Swift-Hohenberg setting.

We have a special case when λ = ν and thus the stationary solution z has a
non-trivial invariant measure, which would be the case, when A = −∂4
x +ν. This
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to the Swift-Hohenberg equation, where λ = −1 + ν and
the invariant measure corresponding to z concentrates at z = 0. These will be
our two examples treated later in Section 4.6.

3.1 Existence of solutions

We assume that the following theorem holds true. It can easily be proven by
a Galerkin approximation or the approximation using bounded domains.
Its
proof in a slightly diﬀerent setting can be found for example in [5] where a
Galerkin approximation was used, or in [4] where the problem is approximated
by periodic solutions.

3.2 Basics on Random dynamical systems

First in order to ﬁx notation, let us state very brieﬂy the well known setting of
random dynamical systems. See the monograph of Arnold, [1], or the seminal
paper by Crauel & Flandoli, [9], for details.
Let (X,(cid:107) · (cid:107)X ) be a separable real Banach space with Borel σ-algebra B(X)
and (Ω,F, P) be a probability space.

6

Deﬁnition 3.3. The quadruple (Ω,F, P, (θt)t∈R) is called a metric dynamical
system if the map θ : R × Ω → Ω is (B(R) × F,F)-measurable, the map θ0 is
the identity on Ω, the ﬂow property θs+t = θt ◦ θs holds for all s, t ∈ R and P is
an invariant measure for θt for all t ∈ R.
Deﬁnition 3.4. A random dynamical system (RDS) (θ, φ) consists of a metric
dynamical system (Ω,F, P, (θt)t∈R) and a co-cycle mapping φ : R+ × Ω × X →
X, which is (B(R+) × F × B(X),B(X))-measurable and satisﬁes the following
properties:

(i) φ(0, ω, x) = x

(initial condition)

(ii) φ(s, θtω, φ(t, ω, x)) = φ(s + t, ω, x)
for all s, t ∈ R+, x ∈ X and ω ∈ Ω. We call a RDS continuous if φ(t, ω,·) is
continuous with respect to x for each t (cid:62) 0 and ω ∈ Ω.

(co-cycle property)

Denote by 2X the collection of all subsets of X. We now deﬁne various

notions of random sets (bounded, compact and invariant).
Deﬁnition 3.5. A set-valued map B : Ω → 2X is called a random set in X if
the mapping ω (cid:55)→ dist(x, B(ω)) is (F,B(R)) measurable for all x ∈ X.
A random set B in X is called a random closed set if B(ω) is non-empty
and closed for each ω ∈ Ω. A random closed set is called a random compact set
if B(ω) is additionally compact for all ω ∈ Ω.
A random set is called φ-invariant if for P-a.e. ω ∈ Ω we have φ(t, ω, A(ω)) =
A(θtω) for all t (cid:62) 0 .

Tempered sets will be important in the following, as the pull-back attraction

is exponential in many cases so we can allow for slow growth.
Deﬁnition 3.6. A random set B: Ω → 2X is called a bounded random set if
there is a non-negative random variable R, such that
d(B(ω)) := sup{(cid:107)x(cid:107)X : x ∈ B(ω)} (cid:54) R(ω)

for all ω ∈ Ω .

A bounded random set is said to be tempered with respect to (Ω,F, P, (θt)t∈R)
if for P-a.e. ω ∈ Ω,

t→∞ e−µtd(B(θ−tω)) = 0

lim

for all µ > 0.

In the following deﬁnition of an absorbing random set, we always think of D

as a family of either deterministic sets or tempered random sets.
Deﬁnition 3.7. Let D be collection of random sets in X. Then a random set
B ∈ D is called a D-random absorbing set for an RDS (θ, φ) if for any random
set D ∈ D and P-a.e. ω ∈ Ω, there exists a TD(ω) > 0 such that
for all t (cid:62) TD(ω).

φ(t, θ−tω, D(θ−tω)) ⊂ B(ω)

Crucial for the existence of random attractors is the notion of asymptotic

compactness.

7

Deﬁnition 3.8. Let D be collection of random sets in X. Then φ is said to be
D-pull-back asymptotically compact in X if for any given B ∈ D the sequence
{φ(tn, θ−tn ω, xn)}∞
n=1 has a convergence subsequence in X for P-a.e. ω ∈ Ω,
whenever tn → ∞ and xn ∈ B(θ−tn ω).
Deﬁnition 3.9. Let D be collection of random sets in X. Then a random set
A ∈ D in X is called a D-random attractor (or D-pull-back random attractor)
for an RDS (θ, φ) if

(i) A is a compact random set,

(ii) A is φ-invariant,
(iii) A attracts every random set D ∈ D, that is, for every D ∈ D,

t→∞ distX (φ(t, θ−tω, D(θ−tω)), A(ω)) = 0, P-almost surely,

lim

with distX (Y, Z) = supy∈Y inf z∈Z (cid:107)y − z(cid:107)X for any Y ⊆ X and Z ⊆ X
being the Hausdorﬀ semi-metric.

For the abstract result on existence and uniqueness of random attractors we

also need the universe of tempered sets.
Deﬁnition 3.10. A collection D of random sets in X is called inclusion-closed
if whenever E is an arbitrary random set, and F is in D with E(ω) ⊂ F (ω) for
all ω ∈ Ω, then E must belong to D. A collection D of random sets in X is said
to be a universe if it is inclusion-closed.

The following result on the existence of pull-back attractor is now well

known. See for example Bates, Lu & Wang [18, 3].
Theorem 3.11. Let D be a universe in X and (θ, φ) be a continuous RDS
on X. Suppose that there exists a closed random absorbing set B ∈ D and that
φ is D-pull-back asymptotically compact in X. Then, φ has a unique D-random
attractor A ∈ D, which is given by

A(ω) =

φ(t, θ−tω, B(θ−tω)),

ω ∈ Ω.

3.3 Brownian driving system

Here we introduce the driving system that underlies a Brownian motion; we
refer to [1], for more details.
Consider the canonical probability space (Ω,F, P) given by the Wiener space

with

Ω = {ω ∈ C(R, R) : ω(0) = 0} ,

F the Borel σ-algebra induced by the compact open topology of Ω, and P the
corresponding Wiener measure on (Ω,F). Thus we can identify the identity on
Ω with a Brownian motion, i.e.

β(t) = ω(t)

for t ∈ R and ω ∈ Ω.

Finally, we deﬁne the time shift by

θtω(·) = ω(· + t) − ω(t), ω ∈ Ω, t ∈ R.

In that setting it is well known that (Ω,F, P, (θt)t∈R) is an ergodic metric dy-
namical system.

3.4 Stationary solution

We discuss now the existence of a unique spatially constant stationary solution
of (2). Denote by z the stationary real-valued solution of the SDE

dz = [λz + f (z)]dt + σdβ .

(3)

By the celebrated result of Crauel & Flandoli [9], there is only one stationary
solution (up to null-sets). The key argument is that, due to monotonicity of
the corresponding RDS, the random attractor is a single random point. Let us
state this as a theorem.

Theorem 3.12. There is a tempered random variable z such that a stationary
solution of (3) is given by z(t, ω) = z(θtω). Moreover, z is unique up to null-
sets.

Proof. This claim is mainly from [9] as z necessarily lies inside the unique ran-
dom attractor for (3), which is a single point.

For temperedness we just remark that the existence of a tempered absorbing
set for (3) is straightforward. Due to nonlinear stability one could even show
that every set is absorbed. As the absorbing set contains the random attractor,
the random variable z(ω) is tempered. It is given as a random ball around the
stationary OU-process.

To complement the previous proof, let us give a simple direct argument for
z to be tempered. We deﬁne z2 = z − z1, where z1(θtω) is the stationary
OU-process solving

This is given by a tempered random variable z1 = σ(cid:82) 0

dz1 + z1dt = σdβ .

−∞ esdβ. Thus it is
suﬃcient to prove that z2 is tempered. The process z1(θtω) is also growing at
most polynomially for t → −∞ and so is also

r1(θtω) := |z1(θtω)|2 + |z1(θtω)|4 .

On the other hand, z2(θtω) is the stationary solution of the random ODE

dz2 = (ν + 1)(z1 + z2)dt − (z1 + z2)3dt .

Diﬀerentiating |z2|2 yields, for every µ > 0,
|z2|2 ≤ Cν(|z1|2 + |z2|2) + C|z1|4 − 1

3.5 Transformation to a random PDE

In order to study the random attractor for (2), we transform to a random PDE
using the stationary solution z of the previous section. This also shows that (2)
generates a RDS on L2
ρ.

Deﬁne

v(t, ω; u0 − z(ω)) := u(t, ω; u0) − z(θtω) ,

where u is a solution of (2). Then v satisﬁes

∂tv = Av + f (v + z) − f (z),

(4)

with initial data

v(0, x) = v0 = u0 − z(ω).

Let u(t, ω; u0) := v(t, ω; u0 − z(ω)) + z(θtω). Then the stochastic process u
ρ → L2

is a solution of equation (2). We now deﬁne a mapping φ : R+ × Ω × L2
by

ρ

φ(t, ω, u0) = u(t, ω; u0) = v(t, ω; u0 − z(ω)) + z(θtω),
with u(0) = u0. Sometimes, we also write φ(t, ω, u0) as φ(t, ω)u0.

It follows immediately that φ satisﬁes the conditions of Deﬁnition 3.4 and
hence (θ, φ) is a continuous random dynamical system associated with our
stochastic parabolic equation.

4 Random attractor for SPDE

In this section we prove that the random attractor exists for (2) in the weighted
space L2
ρ. This is a standard proof following the ideas of Bates, Lu, & Wang
[3]. First one shows the existence of an absorbing set in L2
ρ and then additional
regularity of that set for example in H 1
ρ . Finally, compactness is established by
bounds on the far ﬁeld.

The main diﬃculty is the fact that we cannot rely on additional Lp

ρ-estimates
or the maximum principle, as in the case when A is only an operator of second
order.
From the rest of the section, we always assume that D is the universe
ρ with respect to the Brownian driving system

of tempered random sets in L2
(Ω,F, P, (θt)t∈R).

4.1 Absorbing ball for tempered sets in L2
ρ

First we show that there is a random ball with deterministic radius that pull-
back attracts all tempered sets.

Lemma 4.1. Denote the solution of (2) by v(t, ω, v0) with random initial con-
dition v0 = u0 − z(ω). There is a constant K = (cid:107)ρ(cid:107)L1(2ν + Cη0 + 1)2/4δ such
that for all ω ∈ Ω and all t ≥ 0

(cid:107)v(t, ω, v0(ω))(cid:107)2

≤ e−t(cid:107)v0(ω)(cid:107)2

(5)
Let B = {B(ω)}ω∈Ω ∈ D be a tempered set then for P -a.e. ω ∈ Ω, there is a
1 + K and a random time T0 := T0(B, ω) > 0 such
deterministic radius r1 =
that for all v0(ω) ∈ B(ω) and all t > T0, we have the following estimate:

We prove now that there is an L2
ρ-absorbing set, which is bounded in H 1

H 1
ρ

≤ C[e−t(cid:107)v0(ω)(cid:107)2 + 1] .

Moreover, there exists a deterministic radius r2 such that for every tempered set
B = {B(ω) : ω ∈ Ω} ∈ D of initial conditions v0(ω) ∈ B(ω), we obtain that for
all t > T1, with T1 the random time from Lemma 4.2,
≤ r2 .

4.4 Uniform integrability

In order to proof the compactness of our absorbing set, we prove ﬁrst uniform
integrability. Therefore, we use a cut-oﬀ function. Let ϕ(·) ∈ C∞(R) be sym-
metric such that 0 ≤ ϕ(s) ≤ 1 for all s ∈ R and

0

ϕ(s) =

for |s| ≥ 2 .

Now let us deﬁne ϕr(x) = ϕ(x/r) for r ≥ 1.
Lemma 4.4. Let v be the solution of (4). Then for any ε > 0, there exist a
deterministic Rε ≥ 1, a deterministic time Tε ≥ 1 and some constant C > 0
such that for t ≥ Tε and r ≥ Rε and all ω ∈ Ω

(cid:107)ϕrv(t, ω, v0(ω))(cid:107)2

Moreover, for any tempered set B = {B(ω) : ω ∈ Ω} ∈ D and solutions starting
in v0(ω) ∈ B(ω), there exists a random time T3 depending also on B and ε such
that for all t > T3 and r > Rε

(cid:90)

|x|>r

ρ|v(t, θ−tω, v0(θ−tω))(x)|2 dx ≤ ε.

Proof. We consider the L2

calculations we obtain:

4.5 Random atractor

We could now prove the existence for a random attractor for (4) both forward
and backward in time, but we directly aim for the random attractor for (2).
Note that we have the following transformation, such that for each t ≥ 0 and
ω ∈ Ω

u(t, ω, u0) = v(t, ω, u0 − z(ω)) + z(θtω) .

(13)
Suppose B = {B(ω) : ω ∈ Ω} is a tempered family of non-empty subsets of L2
ρ.
Given B we deﬁne the family ˜B by
ρ : (cid:107)w(cid:107)2

(B(ω))2 + 2|z(ω)|2} .

˜B(ω) = {w ∈ L2

≤ 2 · diamL2

ρ

L2
ρ

The following properties hold:

• if B is tempered, then also ˜B is tempered (because z(ω) is tempered);
• if u(θ−tω) ∈ B(θ−tω), then v(θ−tω) = u(θ−tω) − z(θ−tω) ∈ ˜B(θ−tω).

Hence, we obtain estimates for u immediately from (13) and the corresponding
bounds for v.

16

Lemma 4.5. There exists a deterministic radius r > 0 such that for all tempered
B = {B(ω) : ω ∈ Ω} and u0 ∈ B(ω) there is a a random time T such that for
all t > T the solution of (2) satisﬁes

(cid:107)u(t, θ−tω, u0(θ−tω))(cid:107)H 1

ρ

≤ r2 + |z(ω)| .

Lemma 4.6. For any ε > 0 there is a random R = R(ω, ε) ≥ 1 such that for
any tempered sets B = {B(ω) : ω ∈ Ω} and initial conditions u0 ∈ B(ω) there
exists a random time T = T (ω, ε, B) such that for all t > T and r > R, the

solution of (2) satisﬁes(cid:90)

In contrast to Lemma 4.4, the radius R is now random, as we need that

We can now formulate the compactness result for the RDS given by (2).

Theorem 4.7. The RDS (θ, φ) generated by (2) is asymptotically compact
ρ. This means that for every ω ∈ Ω, every tempered set B = {B(ω) :
in L2
ω ∈ Ω}, sequence tn → ∞, and initial conditions un(ω) ∈ B(ω), the sequence
u(tn, θ−tn ω, un(θ−tn ω)) has a convergent subsequence in L2
ρ.
Proof. Fixed ω ∈ Ω we need to show that the sequence

Un(ω) = u(tn, θ−tn ω, u0,n(θ−tn ω))

is relatively compact (or totally bounded), i.e.
covering of balls of radii less than ε.

By Lemma 4.6 there exists R and N such that for all n ≥ N ,
where QR = {x ∈ R : |x| ≤ R}.

(cid:107)Un(cid:107)L2

ρ(R\QR) ≤ ε

for every ε > 0 it has a ﬁnite

On the other hand, by Lemma 4.5 there exists N(cid:63) ≥ N such that for all

ρ(QR), the sequence Un is
ρ(QR) of balls of radii

in L2

Combining both parts, Un has a ﬁnite covering of ball of radii less than 2ε
ρ(R).
From Theorem 4.7 and Lemma 4.5, we can use Theorem 3.11 to obtain the

existence of the pull-back attractor.

Theorem 4.8. The RDS (θ, φ) generated by (2) has a unique pull-back attractor
A in L2
ρ.

17

4.6 Generalizations

The result on existence of random attractor stated in Theorem 4.8 in the setting
of the Swift-Hohenberg equation holds in a much more general setting. We
state a few remarks about the modiﬁcations necessary in the arguments for
such generalizations.
Remark 4.9 (Linear Operator). For the linear operator A = p(−∆) we could
consider other functions p of the Laplacian ∆, and even odd derivatives of lower
order. The main estimate we need to establish is the key result of Lemma 2.1.
But we do not need non-negativity of the operator. We mainly need for some
k > d/2, where d is the dimension of the underlying domain, that there are
constants c, C > 0 such that

(cid:104)Av, v(cid:105)L2

ρ

≤ −c(cid:107)v(cid:107)2

H k
ρ

+ C(cid:107)v(cid:107)2

L2
ρ

.

This should hold in the case of the function p being bounded from above on [0,∞)
with suﬃciently fast growth at inﬁnity, like an even polynomial with negative
leading order coeﬃcients.
Remark 4.10 (Nonlinearity). We mainly treat the stable cubic −u3 in all our
It is essential that the nonlinearity induces a stronger non-linear
examples.
stability in Lp-spaces, but we are not restricted to the cubic.
It should be a
straightforward generalization to use the whole machinery for general nonlin-
earities f : R → R, where f (u) ∼ −u|u|p−2 for some p > 2 and large u → ±∞.
So, for example, any polynomial of odd degree with negative leading coeﬃcient
should be possible.

Remark 4.11 (Higher dimension). All the results presented so far treat the
one-dimensional case, but the results do generalize to higher dimensions. In the
case of x ∈ R2 for the Swift-Hohenberg setting of (2), we could also obtain the
existence of random attractor in L2
ρ, as most estimates for the linear operator
and the nonlinearity do not rely on the dimension.

Let us remark that the existence result needs a Sobolev embedding of the
H k-space, controlled by the linear operator, into C 0-spaces at least locally on
bounded domains. So here we might need a restriction to lower dimensions.

Remark 4.12 (General Noise). It is non trivial to consider general additive
noise, as in some estimates we explicitly rely on the scalar nature of the sta-
tionary solution z. Moreover, in our case we can rely on well-known SDE results
for z, which are not easily established in the case of general additive noise given
for instance by the derivative of a Q-Wiener process. It is not straightforward
to establish results, Especially, when the noise is translation-invariant (i.e., spa-
tially stationary); even the existence of stationary solutions does not seem to be
established yet, although it should be possible by adapting standard results.

For the existence of RDS and random attractors in the general noise case,
one would consider z only as the stationary solution of the stationary stochastic
convolution, i.e. the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process solving the linearised SPDE.
But this would require changes to many of the estimates presented here.

18

5 Size of attractor for deterministic PDE

In this section, we consider σ = 0 and state some results and conjectures on
the size of the deterministic attractor for ν > 0. We provide straightforward
bounds on the diameter of the attractor in L2
ρ and discuss lower bounds on the
dimension, which should be high dimensional for ν > 0 as an inﬁnite band of
eigenvalues changes stability.

For the discussion we restrict ourselves to the case

(14)

∂tu = Au + νu − u3,
x)2 or A = −∂4

posed on R where A = −(1 + ∂2
x. Let us ﬁrst remark that the
existence of a deterministic attractor in the space L2
ρ follows analogously to the
estimates presented in the previous sections with z = 0, as we never used that
the noise is non-zero.

Let us ﬁrst state, as a conjecture without proof, why we think that the

attractor is inﬁnite dimensional.

Remark 5.1 (High dimensional attractor). In the case of ν > 0 and no noise
(i.e., σ = 0), a bifurcation analysis of the PDE (14) posed on [0, L] with periodic
boundary conditions shows, that there is a continuous interval I = I(ν) ⊂ R
of periods such that for all L ∈ I there is a non-trivial L-periodic stationary
solution that has no smaller periodicity.

As all these stationary solutions are in L2

ρ for an integrable weight ρ, the
deterministic attractor for the PDE posed in L2
ρ contains for ν > 0 immedi-
ately uncountably many stationary solutions. Moreover, all translations of such
periodic solutions are again stationary solutions.
A = −∂4

In the Swift-Hohenberg case the set I is an interval around 2π, while for

x it is of the type I = [L0,∞).

But the attractor does not only contain periodic solutions. Here we restrict
to the second example, as for Swift-Hohenberg there are constant stationary
solutions only if ν > 1.
Remark 5.2 (Spatial heteroclinic). Consider the PDE (14) with A = −∂4
x, and
suppose for the weight ρ > 1, so that constants are in L2
ρ. It should be possible, at
least for small ν, to show that there is also at least one heteroclinic solution of the
µ ∈ R via the unstable
scalar ODE ∂4
ﬁxed-point 0. This deﬁnes a non-periodic stationary solution of our PDE, again
with the property that all translations are again stationary solutions. So the
attractor contains an inﬁnitely long continuous curve of stationary solutions

xu = νu−u3 connecting the ﬁxed-points ±√

that connects the spatially constant solutions u = ±√

µ ∈ L2

Let us ﬁnally state an observation on the diameter of the random attractor

But we believe that for Swift-Hohenberg a similar bound is true by restricting
to 2π-periodic solutions. For any ν > 0 we ﬁnd a stationary 2π-periodic solution
of (14) with L2[0, 2π]-norm of the order

conjecture that the diameter of the attractor scales like(cid:112)ν/c.

6 Stabilization

In this section we present the main results on stabilization. We will need the
following assumption

Assumption 6.1. There are constants η > 0 and Cδ > 0 such that for all
v ∈ L2

ρ and z ∈ R

(cid:104)v, Av(cid:105)L2

ρ

≤ η(cid:107)v(cid:107)2

,

L2
ρ

and

(cid:104)f (v + z) − f (z), v(cid:105)L2

ρ

≤ −Cδz2(cid:107)v(cid:107)2

L2
ρ

.

This assumption is for example satisﬁed (using Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2) for
x)2 + ν and f (u) = −u3. We can also treat
x + ν where, in contrast to Swift-Hohenberg, the

Swift-Hohenberg with A = −(1 + ∂2
a second example with A = −∂4
bifurcating mode is forced directly.

Theorem 6.2. Suppose (2) generates a RDS in L2
ρ and let z be the unique
stationary solution from Subsection 3.4. Under assumption 6.1. If Ez2 > η/Cδ
then the random attractor in L2
ρ is a single point given by the stationary solu-
tion z.

Proof.

We can now use this result to determine the regime, where the stationary so-
lution of SH is globally stable and thus stabilization sets is. We need to calculate
the expected value Ez2. This will be done via Fokker-Planck in Section 6.1.

20

Remark 6.3. Let us remark that on bounded domains is is possible to study
also local stability of the stationary solution in H 1, which holds true under a
weaker condition. But on unbounded domains this fails, as we cannot bound the

remaining term z(cid:82) ρvv2

xdx by powers of the H 1

ρ -norm.

Let us ﬁnally state a straightforward generalization to general additive noise.

Consider the following SPDE

du = [Au + f (u)]dt + dW,

(15)

for some general Q-Wiener process W .

Assumption 6.4. Suppose that (15) generates a RDS in L2
smooth solutions. Furthermore, let Z be a stationary ergodic solution of

ρ with suﬃciently

dZ = [AZ + f (Z)]dt + dW,

and suppose that there is a constant Cδ > 0 such that for all v ∈ L4

ρ

(cid:104)f (v + Z) − f (Z), v(cid:105)L2

ρ

≤ −Cδ(cid:107)Zv(cid:107)2

L2
ρ

.

We remark without proof that this assumption is true in case of Swift-
Hohenberg with the stable cubic f (u) = −u3. To generate a RDS one needs
some regularity of the Wiener process W .

Deﬁne for the random variable Z the maximum of the numerical range by

Λ(Z) = sup

{(cid:104)v, (A − CδZ 2)v(cid:105)L2

} .

ρ

Theorem 6.5. Under Assumption 6.4, if EΛ(Z) < 0, then the random attractor
in L2

ρ is a single point given by the stationary solution Z.

The proof is similar to Theorem 6.2 using Gr¨onwall’s lemma and Birkhoﬀ’s

theorem.

6.1 Fokker-Planck
In the setting of Theorem 6.2 we can explicitly calculate the expected value Ez2.
The density p of the stationary process z corresponding to the SDE (3) solves
the Fokker-Planck equation

σ2p(cid:48)(cid:48) + [(ζ 3 − λζ)p](cid:48) = 0 .

This has the explicit solution

p(ζ) =

with normalization constant

(cid:90)

CN =

exp{−(ζ 4 − 2λζ 2)/2σ2}dζ .

21

Thus we obtain

(cid:82)

Ez2 =

(cid:82)
R ζ 2 exp{−(ζ 4 − 2λζ 2)/2σ2}dζ
R exp{−(ζ 4 − 2λζ 2)/2σ2}dζ

.

(16)

In the following, in our examples, we evaluate (16) either asymptotically for
small σ or numerically for medium range σ. We expect that in the example
of Swift-Hohenberg with λ < 0, the point 0 is deterministically stable in (3)
with exponential rate λ. Thus we expect Ez2 ∼ σ2/|λ| for σ small, which is the
typical scaling of an OU-process. We will treat this in our ﬁrst example and
quantify the amount of noise necessary to stabilize the equation, i.e. to destroy
the random attractor so that it collapses to a single point.

In contrast to that, for λ > 0 we expect that the limit limσ→0 Ez2 exists
of (3) for small σ concentrate around the two deterministic points ±√
and it is a λ-dependent positive constant. This is due to the fact that solutions
λ. But
we will see later in our second example with A = −∂4
x + ν that this is still not
suﬃcient for proving stabilization for arbitrarily small noise. Again, we need
the noise to be strong enough.

6.2 Result for Swift-Hohenberg

In our examples we have to check the requirements for Theorem 6.2 and As-
sumption 6.1. For Swift-Hohenberg, Lemma 2.1 tells us that

if the constant c in the weight ρ is small enough (recall that ρ → 1 for c → 0).

η = ν + O(c2)

Lemma 2.2 yields with δ ∈(cid:0)0, 1

(cid:1)

4

and λ = −1 + ν

Cδ = 3 −

4(1 − δ)

Our ﬁrst result is the following:
Proposition 6.6. Consider the setting of Swift-Hohenberg, as in (2), with ν ∈
(0, 1) and suppose that

ν <

σ2

and σ (cid:28) 1 − ν .

3
2

Then we can choose 0 < c (cid:28) 1 in the weight and the constant in the nonlinear
estimate 0 < δ (cid:28) 1 both suﬃciently small such that stabilization holds in L2
ρ.
Proof. We ﬁrst notice that for c and δ suﬃciently small by Theorem 6.2 stabi-
lization holds in case ν < 3

the condition for stabilization becomes Ey2 > 4

Now we can re-substitute and rewrite the condition for stability as

σ2(1 + O(σ2−2α

Note that the previous conditions are only satisﬁed if also ν is small, thus we
can simplify to ν < 3

2 σ2.

If we compare this result with the one in [16], we have that for ν close to 0, the
two are quite similar, requiring a noise strength such that ν < 3
2 σ2. But this is
just the asymptotic evaluation of our result. In Figure 1 we see various curves of
the function σ (cid:55)→ 3
Ez2/ν corresponding to the stability condition for diﬀerent ν.
We see that once σ is suﬃciently large, stabilization sets in. In Figure 2 we see
the various values of the noise-strength σ after which stabilization sets in as a
function of ν.

6.3 A second example
In this second example we consider the setting of (2), but now with A = −∂4
Similar to Lemma 2.1, we obtain in this case

η = ν + O+(c2)

and now λ = ν.

Nevertheless, we conjecture that Ey2 = 1 + σ2
In Figure 3 we see various curves of the function σ (cid:55)→ 3

that stabilization sets in for suﬃciently large noise strength, but our estimate is
not optimal here, because we cannot provide a sharp control of the error term.

Ez2/ν corresponding
to the stability condition for diﬀerent ν. We see again that once σ is suﬃciently
large, stabilization sets in. In Figure 2 we see the various values of the noise-
strength σ after which stabilization sets in as a function of ν.

6.4 Comments on further examples

Many examples we tried have a similar result than the two results presented
here. For suﬃciently large noise strength one obtains stabilization. This is the
case, when we replace the cubic with a stable polynomial of higher odd degree
like f (u) = −u|u|2p, p ∈ N.
x + µ)2u + νu − u3 + σ∂tβ we again obtain a result
similar to the one for Swift-Hohenberg, that is stabilization occurs for small
ν. The drawback in this setting is that the noise intensity σ has to satisfy the
following two conditions:

If we consider ∂tu = −(∂2

(ν − µ2)(

1
3

ν + µ2) < σ2 (cid:28) ν − µ2.

Finally, another example one could think about is the following: ∂tu =
xu + αu2 − u3, but in this case our approach never worked well, because our
∂4
estimate is always a little bit oﬀ.
