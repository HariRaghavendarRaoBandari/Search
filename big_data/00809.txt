THE COMPUTATION OF DISCONNECTED BIFURCATION

DIAGRAMS

Abstract. Arclength continuation and branch switching are enormously successful algorithms
for the computation of bifurcation diagrams. Nevertheless, their combination suﬀers from three
signiﬁcant disadvantages. The ﬁrst is that they attempt to compute only the part of the diagram
that is continuously connected to the initial data; disconnected branches are overlooked. The second
is that the subproblems required (typically determinant calculation and nullspace construction) are
expensive and hard to scale to very large discretizations. The third is that they can miss connected
branches associated with nonsimple bifurcations, such as when an eigenvalue of even multiplicity
crosses the origin. Without expert knowledge or lucky guesses, these techniques alone can paint an
incomplete picture of the dynamics of a system.

In this paper we propose a new algorithm for computing bifurcation diagrams, called deﬂated
continuation, that is capable of overcoming all three of these disadvantages. The algorithm combines
classical continuation with a deﬂation technique that elegantly eliminates known branches from
consideration, allowing the discovery of disconnected branches with Newton’s method. Deﬂated
continuation does not rely on any device for detecting bifurcations and does not involve computing
eigendecompositions; all subproblems required in deﬂated continuation can be solved eﬃciently if a
good preconditioner is available for the underlying nonlinear problem. We prove suﬃcient conditions
for the convergence of Newton’s method to multiple solutions from the same initial guess, providing
insight into which unknown branches will be discovered. We illustrate the success of the method on
several examples where standard techniques fail.

1. Introduction. We consider numerical methods for computing the solutions

of

f (u, λ) = 0,

(1.1)
where f : U × R → Y is the C 1 problem residual, U and Y are isomorphic Banach
spaces, u ∈ U is referred to as the solution, and λ ∈ R is referred to as the parameter.
In our applications, (1.1) typically represents the residual of a stationary ordinary or
partial diﬀerential equation, along with boundary conditions. The associated bifur-
cation diagram visualizes how the behaviour of a functional of the solutions changes
as λ is varied over some interval of interest [λmin, λmax].

Arclength continuation and branch switching [17, 10, 15, 8, 27] are central tech-
niques in the computational analysis of (1.1) and are routinely used throughout science
and engineering. Given an initial point (u0, λ0) on a branch, arclength continuation
(or its popular variant, pseudo-arclength continuation) robustly traces out the re-
mainder of that branch. It parameterizes the solution and parameter (u(s), λ(s)) as

Fig. 1.1: Sketch of switching continuation. Arclength (or pseudo-arclength) continu-
ation is applied on a branch as in Figure 1.1a. When a bifurcation point is detected,
the nullspace of the Fr´echet derivative there is computed and is used to switch branch,
depicted in Figure 1.1b. Once a point on the emanating branch is known, continuation
traces out the branch as in Figure 1.1c.

a function of arclength along the curve s from the initial point, as this allows the
method to continue through fold bifurcations. It applies a predictor computed from
previous solutions to estimate the solution and parameter for s + ∆s, and corrects
this guess with a solver such as Newton’s method.

Branch switching algorithms attempt to detect bifurcation points along a branch
and to construct initial solutions on the branches emanating from it, Figure 1.1. The
detection step typically relies on the computation of the bifurcation test functional

(cid:32)(cid:89)

(cid:33)

τ (u, λ) = sign(det J(u, λ)) = sign

µi(u, λ)

,

(1.2)

where µi are the eigenvalues of the (discretized) Jacobian J, including multiplicities.
This test functional is cheaply computable if an LU decomposition of J is already
available from a continuation step [27], but is very diﬃcult to estimate if a Krylov
method is used. Once a bifurcation point has been identiﬁed, initial guesses for
solutions on the emanating branches are constructed from the nullspace of J there.
Once one solution on each emanating branch is known, arclength continuation is used
to complete the branch. Henceforth, this combination of arclength continuation and
branch switching will be referred to as switching continuation.

Switching continuation computes fragments of bifurcation diagrams: it attempts
to compute the part of the bifurcation diagram that is continuously connected to the
initial point (u0, λ0). However, it is often the case that the bifurcation diagram is
not connected, with multiple branches that do not meet at bifurcation points. For
example, pitchfork and transcritical bifurcations are not generic; they are destroyed
under perturbation [15, Chapter IV], and subsequently the complete bifurcation di-
agram cannot be computed in one pass with the approach described above. Other
examples will be given in section 4. In these cases, the diagram returned by switching
continuation along a single path is incomplete, giving an unsatisfactory picture of the
solutions to (1.1).

In this work we develop and analyze an alternative algorithm, deﬂated continua-
tion, that is capable of discovering disconnected branches from known ones, without

requiring that a bifurcation point connect the two, Figure 1.2. At the heart of the
method is the deﬂation of known solutions [7, 14]. Deﬂation is a technique that sys-
tematically modiﬁes a nonlinear problem to guarantee that Newton’s method will not
converge to a known root, thus enabling unknown roots to be discovered from the
same initial guess. Fix λ in (1.1) to yield the nonlinear problem

F (u) = 0,

(1.3)
where F : U → Y . Suppose Newton’s method is applied to F from initial guess u0 to
yield the solution u∗
1) nonsingular. Suppose further
that we suspect that (1.3) permits solutions other than u∗
1, but no additional initial
guesses are available. We thus construct a modiﬁed problem

1, with the Fr´echet derivative F (cid:48)(u∗

G(u) = M (u; u∗
via the application of a deﬂation operator M (u; u∗
1) to the residual F . By construction,
this deﬂated residual satisﬁes two properties. The ﬁrst is the preservation of solutions
of F , i.e. for u (cid:54)= u∗
1, G(u) = 0 iﬀ F (u) = 0. The second is that Newton’s method
applied to G will not discover u∗

i.e. along any sequence converging to the known root, the deﬂated residual does not
converge to zero. Thus, if Newton’s method applied to G converges from u0, it will
converge to a distinct solution u∗
1. The process can then be repeated until no
more solutions are found from u0 in a speciﬁed number of Newton iterations. In this
work, we use the shifted deﬂation operator

step for G if a good preconditioner is available for the Newton step of F . For more
details, see [1, 14, 13].

We present the proposed bifurcation algorithm in section 2. To analyze its be-
haviour, in section 3 we develop an initial theory of multiconvergence of Newton’s
method. We derive novel suﬃcient conditions under which Newton’s method will
converge to two diﬀerent solutions, starting from the same initial guess. In section 4,
the method is applied to several problems on which switching continuation fails.

2. Deﬂated continuation. Let [λmin, λmax] be the interval of interest for the
parameter λ, and let ∆λ be the continuation step size. For a given λ, let S(λ) ⊂ U
denote the set of known solutions to (1.3). Given S(λ), Algorithm 2.1 constructs
S(λ + ∆λ) as follows. In the ﬁrst pass (lines 5–9), known solutions are continued with
standard classical continuation; each known solution u0 ∈ S(λ) is used as initial guess
for f (·, λ+∆λ) in turn. If some solutions are not successfully continued, the algorithm
proceeds with the other branches regardless. (This can happen at fold bifurcations, for
example.) As each solution is continued, it is recorded and deﬂated. In the second pass
(lines 10–18), each initial guess is again considered in turn. Deﬂation guarantees that
Newton’s method will not return to the known branch, and hence if Newton’s method
converges, it will converge to a previously unknown solution (line 14). Each initial

COMPUTING DISCONNECTED BIFURCATION DIAGRAMS

guess is attempted repeatedly until no solution is found within a certain number of
Newton iterations. (Recall that Newton’s method is undecidable, i.e. it is impossible
to decide in general if Newton’s method will eventually converge for a given initial
guess [6].) Once all initial guesses have been exhausted, the algorithm increments λ
and continues until the end of the interval has been reached.

2.1. Variants of the algorithm. Various modiﬁcations to the basic algorithm
are possible. The analyst may decide to seek unknown branches with a step size
larger than ∆λ, to reduce the eﬀort spent on unsuccessful Newton iterations. The
continuation and discovery stages are independent and may be executed in parallel;
one group of processors can continue known solutions forwards, while other groups
follow behind, seeking new solutions to continue.

If the system (1.1) has a ﬁnite symmetry group G such that for all g ∈ G,

f (u, λ) = 0 ⇐⇒ f (gu, λ) = 0,

(2.1)
then when a solution u is discovered, its actions Gu should be recorded and deﬂated as
well, assuming that it is possible to represent each gu exactly with the discretization
employed. If the discretization does not respect this symmetry (e.g. a ﬁnite element
discretization on an unstructured mesh), then the projection of gu should be used as
initial guess for Newton’s method instead. Deﬂating inﬁnite symmetry groups will be
studied in future research.

If the system (1.1) has a trivial branch ¯u such that f (¯u, λ) = 0 for all λ, then
this branch must be excluded from the set of initial guesses to use in deﬂation. This
is because the initial residual of (1.4) will evaluate to 0/0. As such trivial branches
are obvious from the equations, the simplest approach is just to deﬂate any trivial
solutions away before beginning Algorithm 2.1.

In the discovery stage, problem-speciﬁc guesses other than the previous solu-
tions may be employed; for example, in nonlinear eigenproblems it may be useful to
use the eigenmodes of an associated linear problem. It may be necessary to break
if the system (1.1) has a Z2 symmetry R such that
the symmetry of the guesses:
f (Ru, λ) = Rf (u, λ), then if Newton’s method is initialized with a symmetric initial
guess satisfying Ru0 = u0 then all subsequent iterates will also remain symmetric.
This will cause nonconvergence to nonsymmetric solutions, such as those introduced
at a symmetry-breaking bifurcation. In this regard it may be advantageous to de-
liberately break the symmetry of the discretization, or if this is not possible (such
as when using a spectral method), to deliberately break the symmetry of the initial
guesses.

It is straightforward in principle to employ other continuation approaches in Al-
gorithm 2.1:
if arclength continuation is used, then in the ﬁrst pass each branch is
synchronized at λ + ∆λ, deﬂation is applied to seek new branches, and the process is
repeated.

3. Convergence analysis. The central question in the analysis of Algorithm
2.1 is: under what circumstances will unknown branches be discovered, and under
what circumstances will they be missed? Given an initial guess u0, we wish to derive
1 and u∗
suﬃcient conditions that guarantee convergence to at least two solutions u∗
2
with Newton’s method and deﬂation, Figure 3.1. In the context of Algorithm 2.1, u0
1 is the solution on the same branch for f (·, λ+∆λ),
is the known solution for f (·, λ), u∗
and u∗

2 is another solution to f (·, λ + ∆λ) on a diﬀerent branch.
The best-known theorem of convergence for Newton’s method is the theorem of
Kantorovich [16], who ﬁrst formulated and analyzed Newton’s method in Banach

Theorem 3.1 (Aﬃne-covariant Newton–Kantorovich [16]). Let F : D → Y be a
continuously Fr´echet diﬀerentiable function on the open convex subset D ⊆ U . Given
u0 ∈ D, assume that
i) F (cid:48)(u0)−1 exists; let α = (cid:107)F (cid:48)(u0)−1F (u0)(cid:107);
ii) (cid:107)F (cid:48)(u0)−1 (F (cid:48)(u) − F (cid:48)(v))(cid:107) ≤ ω0(cid:107)u − v(cid:107) for all u, v ∈ D;
iii) h0 = αω0 ≤ 1
2 ;
iv) B = ¯B(u0, ρ0) ⊂ D for ρ0 = (1 − √
1 − 2h0)/ω0, where B deﬁnes an open ball.
Then the Newton sequence from u0 is well-deﬁned and remains within the ball B.
A solution u∗ ∈ B with F (u∗) = 0 exists, and the Newton sequence converges to
1 − 2h0)/ω0, then u∗ is unique within
it. Furthermore, if we deﬁne ρ+ = (1 +
D ∩ B(u0, ρ+).

One of the main features of this theorem is that all of its assumptions except for
Lipschitz continuity are veriﬁed at the initial guess u0. Convergence can be assured
a priori, without needing to assume the existence of a root beforehand.

which poses regularity problems on the Fr´echet derivative of the deﬂated function in

cannot hold after deﬂation. The same argument holds for the Newton–Mysovskikh
theorem [22].

We therefore seek to base our analysis on results whose conditions are veriﬁed at
the roots themselves, instead of at the initial guess. The theorem we will build upon
is the Rall–Rheinboldt theorem [24, 26], again stated in aﬃne-covariant form.
Theorem 3.2 (Aﬃne-covariant Rall-Rheinboldt [24, 26]). Let F : D → Y be a
continuously Fr´echet diﬀerentiable function on the open convex subset D ⊆ U . Sup-
pose that there exists a u∗ ∈ D such that F (u∗) = 0, and suppose further that
i) F (cid:48)(u∗)−1 exists;
ii) (cid:107)F (cid:48)(u∗)−1 (F (cid:48)(u) − F (cid:48)(v))(cid:107) ≤ ω∗(cid:107)u − v(cid:107) for all u, v ∈ D.
Then any ρ∗ ≤ 2/(3ω∗) such that B = B(u∗, ρ∗) ⊂ D has the property that starting
at u0 ∈ B, the Newton sequence is well-deﬁned and remains within B. The Newton
sequence converges to u∗ ∈ B. Furthermore, if we deﬁne ρ+ = 1/ω∗, then u∗ is unique
within D ∩ B(u∗, ρ+).
A crucial ingredient of this theorem is the aﬃne covariant Lipschitz continuity of
the Fr´echet derivative F (cid:48). Before extending this theorem to the deﬂated case, we ﬁrst
give a lemma regarding the product of Lipschitz continuous functions.

Lemma 3.3 (Product of Lipschitz continuous functions). Let X, Y and Z be
Banach spaces and let L(Y, Z) be the vector space of bounded linear operators from
Y to Z with induced operator norm. Let F : X → Y and G : X → L(Y, Z) be
Lipschitz continuous functions on the open subset D ⊆ X with Lipschitz constants
ωF and ωG respectively. Assume further that F and G are bounded on D, i.e. there
exist NF , NG ∈ R such that (cid:107)F (x)(cid:107) < NF and (cid:107)G(x)(cid:107) < NG for all x ∈ D. Then
the product GF : X → Z is bounded and Lipschitz continuous on D with Lipschitz

constant (NF ωG + NGωF ).

Proof. Let x, y ∈ D. As both F and G are bounded on D their product is bounded

as well:

Furthermore,

(cid:107)G(x)F (x)(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)G(x)(cid:107)(cid:107)F (x)(cid:107) ≤ NGNF < ∞.

(3.1)

(cid:107)G(x)F (x) − G(y)F (y)(cid:107) = (cid:107)G(x)F (x) − G(x)F (y) + G(x)F (y) − G(y)F (y(cid:107)

≤ (cid:107)G(x)F (x) − G(x)F (y)(cid:107) + (cid:107)G(x)F (y) − G(y)F (y)(cid:107)
≤ (cid:107)G(x)(cid:107)(cid:107)F (x) − F (y)(cid:107) + (cid:107)G(x) − G(y)(cid:107)(cid:107)F (y)(cid:107)

1} with u∗

If the norm on U is twice continuously diﬀerentiable on E, the deﬂation operator
(1.6) satisﬁes these conditions. In this case, we can use the composition rule for diﬀer-
entiable functions to show that the deﬂation operator is in turn twice diﬀerentiable on
E. This implies that the deﬂation operator is Lipschitz continuous, as E is bounded.
For 2 ≤ p < ∞, the Lp norm is at least twice continuously diﬀerentiable on any open
subset not containing zero [28, Theorem 8]. More generally, if the Banach space U is
isomorphic to a Hilbert space, then it can be equipped with twice diﬀerentiable norms
[18, 11]. Thus, the conditions demanded are satisﬁed in typical cases of interest.

Proof. As F (u) and M (u; u∗

1) are continuously Fr´echet diﬀerentiable on E, they
are Lipschitz continuous as well by boundedness of E. Lipschitz continuity implies
1) and M(cid:48)(u; u∗
that the operators are bounded on E and thus F (u), F (cid:48)(u), M (u; u∗

are all bounded on E. As a result the Fr´echet derivative of the deﬂated operator

The argument of Theorems 3.4 and 3.5 can be applied again to derive suﬃcient

conditions for a single initial guess to converge to three or more solutions.

A natural question to ask is if Algorithm 2.1 will recover the behaviour of switching
continuation, i.e. if it will always discover connected branches for suﬃciently small
∆λ. This is discussed in the following corollary.
Corollary 3.6 (Connected roots). Let f : D × R → Y and suppose there

similarly for ρ2(λ)), ρ1(λ) + ρ2(λ) → 0 also. Thus, the evaluation of the left-hand side
of (3.7) requires the application of L’Hˆopital’s rule.
A similar formulation applies to the case of branches meeting as λ ↑ λc, and to
more than two roots. Our practical experience does indeed suggest that Algorithm
2.1 is always able to ﬁnd branches connected via a bifurcation point; we conjecture
that (3.7) always holds for suﬃciently regular functions.

Note that these results are nonconstructive, i.e. the Lipschitz constants arising
and the resulting radii of convergence are not in general known. Thus, it could be
the case that the region of multiconvergence is too small to be of practical use in
bifurcation analysis. We therefore apply Algorithm 2.1 to several problems of interest
in the literature to investigate the robustness and eﬃciency of deﬂated continuation.

4. Examples.

4.1. Roots of unity. We consider the complex roots of unity

(4.1)
as the exponent q is varied. For q ∈ N+, the solutions are exp(2πik/q) for k = 1, . . . , q;
this example studies how these solutions bifurcate for non-integer exponents.

zq − 1 = 0

Algorithm 2.1 was applied to (4.1) from q = 2 to q = 9 with ∆q = 0.1. Deﬂation
was applied with power p = 2 and shift σ = 1. The resulting bifurcation diagram is
shown in Figure 4.1, where the quantity plotted is the argument of the solution. For
q = 2, the solutions are z = ±1; the solution z = −1 bifurcates and the resulting
solutions approach z = ±i as q → 4. At q = 4, z = −1 undergoes another bifurcation,
and the process repeats. In general there is a bifurcation at z = −1 for q ∈ 2N+, and
the resulting branches are mutually disconnected from each other.

As the bifurcation diagram is disconnected, switching continuation would identify
at most one branch from any given initial solution. By contrast, deﬂated continuation
identiﬁes the new solutions at z = −1 immediately and correctly computes the entire
diagram.

4.2. Deformation of a slender beam. The deformation of a slender vertical

beam under loading is governed by Euler’s elastica equation [19]

θ(cid:48)(cid:48) + λ2 sin (θ) = µ,

θ(0) = θ(1) = 0,

(4.2)

where s is the arclength along the beam, θ(s) is the angle relative to the vertical axis,
λ is the longitudinal force and µ is the transversal force. This system has long served
as a model problem in bifurcation analysis [25].

Fig. 4.1: Bifurcation diagram for the roots of unity (4.1) as a function of exponent
q. The trivial branch z = 1 is not shown. The bifurcation diagram is disconnected;
switching continuation from q = 2, z = −1 would only identify the branch marked
with red circles. Blue squares denote the discovery of disconnected branches with
deﬂation.

Algorithm 2.1 was applied to (4.2), from λ = 0 to λ = 4π, with continuation
step ∆λ = 0.1. The equation was discretized with 104 piecewise linear ﬁnite elements
using FEniCS [20] and PETSc [3].
In the absence of a transversal force (µ = 0),
the initially straight solution θ(s) = 0 forms a trivial branch and was thus deﬂated
before beginning Algorithm 2.1. Newton’s method was terminated with failure if
convergence did not occur within 102 iterations. Deﬂation was applied with power
p = 2, shift σ = 1 and with distances measured in the H 1 norm. After the forward
continuation pass, arclength continuation backwards in λ was performed (without
deﬂation) to complete the small sections of the bifurcation diagram where branches
were not immediately discovered (cf. Figure 1.2b). The functional used was the L2
norm, signed by sign(θ(cid:48)(0)).
A series of pitchfork bifurcations at λ = nπ for n ∈ N+ (corresponding to the
eigenvalues of the associated linear problem) result in the buckled modes emanating
from the trivial branch. As all branches meet at bifurcation points with the trivial
branch, both switching continuation and deﬂated continuation compute the entire
bifurcation diagram, Figure 4.2a. However, if a transversal force is applied (µ = 1/2),
the reﬂective symmetry is destroyed and the symmetric pitchfork bifurcations degen-
erate. In this case, the initial branch disconnects from all other branches, resulting

in a disconnected bifurcation diagram, Figure 4.2b. All of these other branches are
missed with switching continuation applied to this path, yielding an incomplete rep-
resentation of the dynamics of the system1. Deﬂated continuation correctly computes
the bifurcation diagram without continuation along multiple parameters.

4.3. Nonlinear pendulum. In the previous example, an additional source term
destroyed the symmetry of the bifurcation diagram. This example serves to demon-
strate that the same eﬀect can be achieved by inhomogeneous boundary conditions.
The angle of a pendulum to the vertical is described by the same equation,

θ(cid:48)(cid:48) + sin θ = 0,

(4.3)

but here we impose inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions θ(0) = θ(10) = 2. It is well
known that with these boundary conditions this equation permits multiple solutions
[5]. One possible way to compute these solutions is to attempt a homotopy from the
linear equation θ(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0 via the addition of a parameter ε multiplying the nonlinear
term:

θ(cid:48)(cid:48) + ε sin θ = 0,

θ(0) = θ(10) = 2.

(4.4)

For ε = 0, (4.4) reduces to a trivial linear problem; for ε = 1, the problem of interest
is recovered. It is clear that homotopy methods based on switching continuation will

1It is possible to identify all of these solutions with switching continuation as follows: set µ = 0
and continue λ from 0 to 4π; set λ = 4π and continue µ from 0 to 1/2; set µ = 1/2 and continue
λ from 4π to 0. However, this is laborious and requires expert knowledge of the system; the right
continuation strategy may not be obvious in more complex cases.

identify a solution for ε = 1 only if there is a branch that continuously connects it to
the solution for ε = 0 [23, §11.3].2

Algorithm 2.1 was applied to (4.4), from ε = 0 to ε = 1, with continuation step
∆ε = 10−2. The equation was discretized with 104 standard piecewise linear ﬁnite
elements using FEniCS and PETSc. The same deﬂation and solver settings were
used as in the previous example. The functional considered was the product of the
derivative at the left endpoint and the H 1 norm of the solution.

The resulting bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure 4.3. For ε = 0, the problem
has a unique solution; as continuation is applied to this branch, no bifurcation points
are encountered, and hence with switching continuation only one solution would be
identiﬁed for ε = 1. As previously mentioned, a major diﬃculty with such homotopy
methods is that the resulting bifurcation diagram must continuously connect the
solution for ε = 0 to those of ε = 1; homotopy works robustly if this property holds,
and fails if it does not. With deﬂated continuation, the requirements for success
are weakened. Given a branch {(u(t), λ(t)) : t ∈ [0, 1]}, deﬁne its support to be

2Another approach would be to consider the associated initial-value problem with boundary
conditions θ(0) = 2, θ(cid:48)(0) = ε. The resulting IVP can be solved for varying values of ε and the
solutions with θ(10) = 2 selected. This shooting approach does not generalize to higher dimensions,
and can be unstable.

{λ(t) : t ∈ [0, 1]} ⊂ R. Whereas switching continuation homotopy ﬁnds a solution
only if there exists a continuously connected branch between it and the initial guess,
deﬂated continuation homotopy only necessitates that the union of the supports of
the branches covers the interval [λmin, λmax]. This is precisely the case in Figure
4.3. As the supports of the branches intersect, Algorithm 2.1 is able to discover
the disconnected branches that come into existence at ε ≈ 0.575 and ε ≈ 0.697,
and identiﬁes four additional solutions that switching continuation homotopy neglects
along this path.

4.4. Deformation of a hyperelastic beam. A major strength of deﬂated
continuation is that it scales to ﬁne discretizations of partial diﬀerential equations
(PDEs). Unlike switching continuation, deﬂated continuation does not demand the
nonscalable computation of determinants or diﬃcult eigendecompositions to detect
bifurcations or switch branches.
In fact, all of the subproblems arising in deﬂated
continuation can be solved eﬃciently if a good preconditioner is available for the
underlying forward problem.

The example of section 4.2 modelled the deformation of a beam under compres-
sion with Euler’s elastica equation. In this example, we model the same physical phe-
nomenon, but with a two-dimensional compressible neo-Hookean hyperelastic PDE,
solved with scalable Krylov methods and preconditioners. The potential energy Π is
given by

Fig. 4.4: Bifurcation diagram for the hyperelastic PDE formulation for the deforma-
tion of a beam (4.11) as a function of the displacement on the right-hand boundary.
As before, switching continuation only discovers that part of the diagram labelled
with red circles. Blue squares denote the discovery of disconnected branches with
deﬂation.

Algorithm 2.1 was applied to (4.11), from ε = 0 to ε = 0.2, with continuation
step ∆ε = 0.0005. The equation was discretized with 2 × 104 piecewise linear ﬁnite
elements using FEniCS and PETSc. Newton’s method was terminated with failure if
convergence did not occur within 102 iterations. Each Newton step was solved with
the GAMG algebraic multigrid preconditioner [2], equipped with the near-nullspace
of rigid body modes [12]. Deﬂation was applied with power p = 2, shift σ = 1 and
with distances measured in the H 1 norm. The functional considered was the vertical
component of displacement evaluated at (0.25, 0.05).

It is well-known that for B = T = 0, (4.11) enjoys a Z2 reﬂective symmetry and
its bifurcation diagram undergoes a series of pitchfork bifurcations as ε is increased,
similar to Figure 4.2a. However, in this conﬁguration the reﬂective symmetry has
been broken by imposing a gravitational body force, causing the bifurcation diagram
to disconnect. The resulting diagram is shown in Figure 4.4, and the computed
solutions with positive functional value are shown in Figure 4.5. The bifurcation
diagram has been computed correctly, indicating that Algorithm 2.1 is robust to the
use of indirect solvers, and that it will scale to much ﬁner discretizations of PDEs.

4.5. A generalized Bratu–Gelfand problem in two dimensions. Previous
examples have demonstrated that deﬂated continuation is able to ﬁnd branches that

switching continuation misses because they are disconnected. Switching continuation
can fail in other ways: for example, if a bifurcation is caused by an eigenvalue of even
multiplicity crossing the origin, the standard bifurcation test functional (1.2) will
neglect it. This example exhibits such a bifurcation, and demonstrates that deﬂated
continuation is robust to this failure mode.

We consider the problem of Mittelmann [21]:

−∇2y = −10(y − λey) ≡ φ(y, λ),
∇y · ˆn = 0,

in Ω = (−0.5, 0.5)2,
on ∂Ω.

(4.12)

This is a generalization of the Bratu–Gelfand problem to multiple dimensions with
the addition of a linear term, and has been used as a test problem for the PLTMG [21]
and pde2path [29] continuation codes.

As noted by Mittelmann, this equation has two spatially constant solutions that
satisfy φ(y, λ) = 0, i.e. y(x) = ¯y with ¯y = λe¯y. Linearising around ¯y with y = ¯y + w
yields an eigenvalue problem

as a function of λ. Standard switching continuation approaches that rely on the sign
of the determinant (1.2) as a bifurcation test functional only discover that part of
the diagram labelled with red circles. Blue squares denote the branch overlooked by
switching continuation, but found by deﬂated continuation. Compare with [21, Figure
1], [29, Figure 2a].

Non-trivial perturbations of the constant solutions can be located by examining the
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on Ω. The bifurcation
points are found by solving −10(1 − ¯y) = µm,n where µm,n are the eigenvalues of the
Laplacian with Neumann boundary conditions. In this case, µm,n = (m2 + n2)π2 for
m, n ∈ N+, and thus the bifurcations occur when ¯ym,n = 1 + µm,n/10 and λm,n =
¯ym,ne−¯ym,n . The initial bifurcation points occur at λ0,0 = e−1 ≈ 0.3678 (a fold
bifurcation), λ0,1 = λ1,0 ≈ 0.2724 (a double pitchfork bifurcation), and λ1,1 ≈ 0.1519
(a simple pitchfork bifurcation).

Consider again the computation of the bifurcation test functional τ , deﬁned in
(1.2).
In the case when a simple bifurcation point is crossed τ will indicate this
by negation, as one of the eigenvalues will have passed through the origin. On the
other hand, if an eigenvalue of even multiplicity passes through the origin, τ remains
unchanged.
In this case the bifurcation point is overlooked, and the machinery of
switching continuation is not activated.3

3Switching continuation can be rescued by deliberately breaking the symmetry of the domain, to
unfold the double eigenvalues. Uecker et al. [29, Figure 4] suggest breaking the rotational symmetry of
the domain by solving on ˜Ω = (−0.5, 0.5)×(−0.495, 0.495). The solutions found can then be continued

18

P. E. FARRELL ET AL.

As the Mittelmann problem is two-dimensional, the Laplacian has degenerate
eigenvalues of even multiplicity. For example, its eigenvalues µ0,1 and µ1,0 are identical
but correspond to diﬀerent eigenfunctions (related by rotation). Thus, the associated
bifurcation point at λ ≈ 0.2724 is missed by switching continuation, even though the
bifurcation diagram is connected. This deﬁciency is not speciﬁc to this equation, and
will manifest in any situation where such degeneracy of eigenvalues occurs.

By contrast, the speciﬁc nature of the bifurcation is irrelevant to deﬂated contin-
uation; we expect the algorithm to ﬁnd nearby solutions regardless of the details of
how the branches are connected (or not connected). To investigate this, Algorithm
2.1 was applied to (4.12), for λ ∈ [0.3678, 0.05], with continuation step ∆λ = −0.0001.
The equation was discretized with 1600 piecewise linear ﬁnite elements using FEniCS
and PETSc. Newton’s method was terminated with failure if convergence did not
occur within 102 iterations. The same deﬂation and solver settings were used as in
all previous examples. Following Uecker et al. [29], the functional considered was the
L2 norm of the solution.

The resulting diagram is shown in Figure 4.6. The outer branches (on the top and
bottom) are the constant solutions, with branches bifurcating from the upper branch
at λ0,1 = λ1,0 and λ1,1 as expected, and secondary bifurcations in turn emanating from
these. Importantly, all branches in this interval have been discovered, including the
branch overlooked with switching continuation (denoted with blue squares). Deﬂated
continuation applies to both connected and disconnected bifurcation diagrams on
which switching continuation fails.

5. Conclusion. We have presented a new algorithm for bifurcation analysis that
relies on the elimination of known branches, rather than the detection and analysis
of bifurcation points.
In this way, the algorithm applies equally to connected and
disconnected diagrams. We have developed an initial analysis of multiconvergence of
Newton’s method, giving suﬃcient conditions for when convergence to two solutions
is guaranteed. In numerical experiments the algorithm is eﬀective and succeeds where
switching continuation fails.

Unlike switching continuation, the algorithm relies only on the solution of the orig-
inal nonlinear problem with a ﬁxed parameter value, and the solution of deﬂations
of that problem. The latter is straightforward to implement and solve if a precondi-
tioner for the former is available. There is no need to implement augmented systems
for diﬀerent kinds of bifurcation points, or to compute expensive test functionals, or
to construct the nullspace of singular operators. Thus, if a scalable preconditioner
for the undeﬂated Jacobian is available, it will be possible to apply the algorithm to
massive discretizations of PDEs on supercomputers.
