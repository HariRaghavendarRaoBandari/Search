A NOTE ON THE EQUIVALENCE OF SOME METRIC,

NON-NEWTONIAN AND MULTIPLICATIVE METRIC RESULTS

BAHRI TURAN AND C ¨UNEYT C¸ EVIK

Abstract. In this short note is on the equivalence between non-Newtonian
metric (particularly multiplicative metric) and metric. We present a diﬀerent
proof the fact that the notion of a non-Newtonian metric space is not more
general than that of a metric space. Also, we emphasize that a lot of ﬁxed
point results in the non-Newtonian metric setting can be directly obtained
from their metric counterparts.

1. Introduction and preliminaries

Recently, many papers dealing with non-Newtonian metric and the multiplicative
metric have been published [2-10]. Although the multiplicative metric and non-
Newtonian metric were announced as a new theory for topology and ﬁxed point
theory, many studies can be obtained with a simple observation. In the present work
we show that some topological results of non-Newtonian metric can be obtained
in an easier way. Therefore, a lot of ﬁxed point and common ﬁxed point results
from the metric setting can be proved in the non-Newtonian metric (particularly
the multiplicative metric) setting.

Arithmetic is any system that satisﬁes the whole of the ordered ﬁeld axioms
whose domain is a subset of R. There are inﬁnitely many types of arithmetic,
all of which are isomorphic, that is, structurally equivalent.
In non-Newtonian
calculus, a generator α is a one-to-one function whose domain is all real numbers
and whose range is a subset of real numbers. Each generator generates exactly one
arithmetic, and conversely each arithmetic is generated by exactly one generator.
By α-arithmetic, we mean the arithmetic whose operations and whose order are
deﬁned as

x ˙+ y = α{α−1(x) + α−1(y)}
α-addition
x ˙− y = α{α−1(x) − α−1(y)}
α-subtraction
α-multiplication x ˙× y = α{α−1(x) × α−1(y)}
x ˙/ y = α{α−1(x) ÷ α−1(y)}
α-division
x ˙< y ⇔ α−1(x) < α−1(y)
α-order

(α−1(y) 6= 0)

for all x and y in the range Rα of α. In the special cases the identity function I
and the exponential function exp generate the classical and geometric arithmetics,
respectively.

Now, we give the deﬁnitions of non-Newtonian metric [2] and multiplicative

metric [3] with new notations.

Deﬁnition 1.1. Let X be a non-empty set and let Rα be an ordered ﬁeld generated
by a generator α on R. The map dα : X × X → Rα is said to be a non-Newtonian
metric if it satisﬁes the following properties:

(αm1) ˙0 = α(0) ˙≤ dα(x, y) and dα(x, y) = ˙0 ⇔ x = y,
(αm2) dα(x, y) = dα(y, x)
(αm3) dα(x, y) ˙≤ dα(x, z) ˙+ dα(z, y)

for all x, y, z ∈ X. Also the pair (X, dα) is said to be a non-Newtonian metric
space.

Thus we can deﬁne a new distance for every generator α. When α = exp, the
non-Newtonian metric dexp is called multiplicative metric. Then, Rexp = R+ and
˙0 = 1.
Deﬁnition 1.2. Let X be a non-empty set. The map dexp : X × X → R+ is said
to be a multiplicative metric if it satisﬁes the following properties:

(mm1) 1 ≤ dexp(x, y) and dexp(x, y) = 1 ⇔ x = y,
(mm2) dexp(x, y) = dexp(y, x)
(mm3) dexp(x, y) ≤ dexp(x, z).dexp(z, y)

for all x, y, z ∈ X. Also the pair (X, dexp) is said to be a multiplicative metric space.

Let α be a generator on R and Rα = {α(u) : u ∈ R}. By the injectivity of α we

have
α(u + v) = α(u) ˙+ α(v)
α(u − v) = α(u) ˙− α(v)
α(u × v) = α(u) ˙× α(v)
α(u / v) = α(u) ˙/ α(v)
u ≤ v ⇔ α(u) ˙≤ α(v)

α−1(x ˙+ y) = α−1(x) + α−1(y)
α−1(x ˙− y) = α−1(x) − α−1(y)
α−1(x ˙× y) = α−1(x) × α−1(y)
α−1(x ˙/ y) = α−1(x) / α−1(y)
x ˙≤ y ⇔ α−1(x) ≤ α−1(y)
for all x, y ∈ Rα with u, v ∈ R, x = α(u), y = α(v). Therefore, α and α−1 preserve
basic operations and order.

and

(v 6= 0)

Remark 2.1. Since the generator α and α−1 are order preserving, for any two
elements x and y in Rα, x ˙≤ y if and only if x ≤ y.

Let (X, dα) be a non-Newtonian metric space. For any ε ˙> ˙0 and any x ∈ X the

set

Bα(x, ε) = {y ∈ X : dα(x, y) ˙< ε}

is called an α-open ball of center x and radius ε. A topology on X is obtained
easily by deﬁning open sets as in the classical metric spaces.

Now, let us emphasize that former topology is obtained by real-valued metric

and vice versa.

Theorem 2.2. For any generator α on R and for any non-empty set X
(1) If dα is a non-Newtonian metric on X, then d = α−1 ◦ dα is a metric on X,
(2) If d is a metric on X, then dα = α ◦ d is a non-Newtonian metric on X.

Proof. It is obvious that α and α−1 are one-to-one and order preserving.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.3. For any generator α on R and, let dα and d be a non-Newtonian
metric and a metric on a non-empty set X, respectively, as in Theorem 2.2. If τ α
and τ are metric topologies induced by dα and d, respectively, then τ α = τ .
Proof. Since δε = α−1(ε) > 0 and εδ = α(δ) ˙> ˙0 for all ε ˙> ˙0, δ > 0, we have
Bα(x, εδ) = {y ∈ X : dα(x, y) ˙< εδ} = {y ∈ X : α (d(x, y)) ˙< α(δ)}

= {y ∈ X : d(x, y) < δε} = B(x, δε)

for all x ∈ X, ε ˙> ˙0, δ > 0. Therefore, τ α = τ .

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.4. Under the hypothesis of Corollary 2.3, the topological properties of
(X, d) and (X, dα) are equivalent. In particular, for a sequence (xn) in X and for
an element x ∈ X
(1) xn
(2) (xn) is dα-Cauchy if and only if (xn) is d-Cauchy, and
(3) (X, dα) is complete if and only if (X, d) is complete.

d→ x,

3. Conclusion

The topological results obtained by non-Newtonian metrics (particularly mul-
tiplicative metrics) as in [2-10] are equivalent the ones obtained by metrics.
In
[3-9] some results of the multiplicative metric and in [10] some results of the non-
Newtonian metric have been obtained for the ﬁxed point theory. Those results are
direct consequences of Theorem 2.2 and Corollary 2.4 since any type of contrac-
tion mapping for the non-Newtonian metric space is also a contraction mapping
for the metric space and vice versa. For example, the non-Newtonian contraction
T : X → X as in [10] is the classical Banach contraction since

dα(T (x), T (y)) ˙≤ k ˙×dα(x, y) ⇔ d(T (x), T (y)) ≤ λ.d(x, y)

(3.1)
for all x, y ∈ X where k ∈ [α(0), α(1)) is constant, d = α−1 ◦ dα and λ = α−1(k). In
particular, by Remark 2.1 and by (3.1), the multiplicative contraction T : X → X
as in [2] is the classical Banach contraction since
dexp(T (x), T (y)) ≤ dexp(x, y)λ ⇔ dexp(T (x), T (y)) ˙≤ dexp(x, y)λ = k ˙×dexp(x, y)

⇔ d(T (x), T (y)) ≤ λ.d(x, y)

for all x, y ∈ X where λ ∈ [0, 1) is constant, d = ln ◦dexp and λ = ln k.
In
this way we can obtain most of the non-Newtonian metric results and most of
the multiplicative metric results applying corresponding properties from the metric
setting.
