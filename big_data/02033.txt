Abstract

Colour-kinematics duality suggests that Yang-Mills (YM) theory possesses some hidden Lie
algebraic structure. So far this structure has resisted understanding, apart from some progress in
the self-dual sector. We show that there is indeed a Lie algebra behind the YM Feynman rules. The
Lie algebra we uncover is the Drinfeld double of the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds. More speciﬁcally,
we show that the kinematic numerators following from the YM Feynman rules satisfy a version of
the Jacobi identity, in that the Jacobiator of the bracket deﬁned by the YM cubic vertex is cancelled
by the contribution of the YM quartic vertex. We then show that this Jacobi-like identity is in fact
the Jacobi identity of the Drinfeld double. All our considerations are oﬀ-shell. Our construction
explains why numerators computed using the Feynman rules satisfy the colour-kinematics at four
but not at higher numbers of points. It also suggests a way of modifying the Feynman rules so that
the duality can continue to hold for an arbitrary number of gluons. Our construction stops short
of producing explicit higher point numerators because of an absence of a certain property at four
points. We comment on possible ways of correcting this, but leave the next word in the story to
future work.

Introduction

The Color-Kinematics duality [1] is a statement that the tree-level on-shell scattering amplitudes of
Yang-Mills (YM) theory can be written as a sum over cubic graphs, with the contribution of each
graph being a product of the group structure constants (colour), kinematic numerator depending on
the helicities and momenta of the particles being scattered (kinematics), as well as the product of
propagators, see below for a review. Moreover, the statement is that the kinematic numerators satisfy
the same Jacobi-type identity as the products of the group structure constants. The assumption
that YM amplitudes admit an expression satisfying the color-kinematics duality implies new relations
between amplitudes [1], now commonly referred to as the BCJ relations. Further, [1] conjectured that
the graviton scattering amplitudes can be obtained from the YM ones by a simple squaring procedure,
once a set of YM numerators satisfying the color-kinematics duality has been identiﬁed.

To some extent, the colour-kinematics duality can be explained by embedding YM into string
theory, as a low energy limit of the open string. One then ﬁnds that the BCJ relations follow from the
monodromy properties of the open string scattering amplitude [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Moreover, a similar
embedding of gravity as a low energy limit of the closed string proves the squaring procedure that
leads from YM to graviton amplitudes [5], [6]. Thus, the squaring procedure that allows one to obtain
graviton amplitudes from the colour-kinematic dual form of the YM amplitudes is to a large extent
equivalent to the famous KLT relation [7] between the amplitudes of the two theories. An explicit
form of the YM kinematic numerators can be obtained via the pure spinor formalism [8].

At the same time, a Lagrangian origin of the colour-kinematic dual form of the YM amplitudes
remains to a large extent obscure. Some understanding comes by considering the MHV amplitude

1

sector [9], see also [10]. It then becomes clear that for such amplitudes, the Feynman rules of Yang-
Mills theory do lead directly to amplitudes in a colour-kinematic dual form. The Jacobi identity
satisﬁed by the kinematic numerators receives the interpretation of that of the Lie algebra of area
preserving diﬀeomorphisms of a certain 2-dimensional space[9]. While this result clearly points in the
direction of some Lie algebra being also behind the general YM amplitude, little is understood in this
direction beyond the MHV case.

The purpose of this paper is to report some observations that strengthen the expectation that
there is some inﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra behind the colour-kinematics duality of YM theory. We
do not claim to have completely understood a Lagrangian origin of this duality, but facts we present
clearly point in the direction of the Lie algebra of diﬀeomorphisms, i.e. the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds
with their Lie bracket, as being behind the duality. Our considerations extend those of [9] beyond the
MHV amplitudes. Moreover, our approach also simpliﬁes the MHV story.

It is known that at 4 points the YM Feynman rules directly lead to amplitudes satisfying the
colour-kinematics duality; considerations in [1] start from this fact. We start by observing that there
is also an oﬀ-shell understanding of the 4-point case. Thus, we shall see that the cubic vertex of YM
theory deﬁnes a certain anti-symmetric bracket on vector ﬁelds, and that this bracket does not satisfy
the Jacobi identity. We then observe that raison d’ˆetre of the quartic YM vertex is to correct for
this failure of the Jacobi identity to be satisﬁed. Thus, once the quartic vertex is taken into account,
a certain version of the Jacobi identity can be established. All our considerations are completely
oﬀ-shell.

Equipped with knowledge of a certain oﬀ-shell version of the Jacobi identity as follows from the
YM Feynman rules, we search for a Lie-algebraic explanation, and ﬁnd it in the so-called Drinfeld
double of the Lie algebra of diﬀeomorphisms. Thus, we observe that a certain twist of this Drinfeld
double (which is by construction a Lie algebra) is behind the Jacobi-like identity that we derive from
the YM Feynman rules.

We also put to use the Drinfeld double interpretation at higher points. The Jacobi identity at 4
points implies a partial cancelation in the sum of numerators at higher points. But the cancelation is
only incomplete and, as is well-known, numerators following from the Feynman rules do not satisfy the
colour-kinematics duality at higher points. However, we sketch how this could be corrected by adding
new higher point interactions. Still, we can claim only a partial success in our quest for understanding
the colour-kinematics. This is because in order for our mechanism to work the YM quartic vertex
must be representable as a product of two cubic vertices, which is not the case. Thus, there is still
some key element missing from our story. We ﬁnish with some speculations as to what this can be,
but leave the next step to future work.

The organisation of this paper is as follows. We start by reminding the reader the statement of
the colour-kinematics duality, as well as the related statement that gravity is the square of YM. Then
in Section 3 we write down the YM Feynman rules. We also introduce what we call the YM bracket
in this Section. This is a bracket on vector ﬁelds that follows from the YM Feynman rules, and which
does not satisfy the Jacobi identity. However, this bracket is closely related to the Lie bracket on
vector ﬁelds, as we show. In this Section we also explain why the colour-kinematics duality works
at the level of Feynman rules for the self-dual sector of the theory. The basic reason is that in this
sector the YM bracket coincides with the Jacobi satisfying Lie bracket. We compute the Jacobiator
of the YM bracket in Section 4. The main result of this section is that the YM bracket satisﬁes a
version of the Jacobi identity, once the 4-valent YM vertex is taken into account. We review some
basic facts about Drinfeld doubles in Section 5. Most of the material here is standard, except for our
description of the twist of the double by a symmetric tensor. This is the main ingredient that we need
for the application to YM theory. We describe the Drinfeld double of the algebra of diﬀeomorphisms
in Section 6. The main result in this section is the interpretation of the Jacobi-like identity discovered
from the YM Feynman rules at 4 points as the Jacobi identity of the twisted Drinfeld double. We then
apply our methods to ﬁve point amplitudes. We see that the Jacobi identity established at four points

2

implies a partial cancelation in the sum of kinematic numerators. But this is incomplete cancelation,
and the numerators following from the YM Feynman rules do not satisfy colour-kinematics. However,
our Lie algebraic interpretation suggests a simple way to correct for this. We see that certain parts of
the Lie algebra Jacobi identity at higher points are missing from what follows from the Feynman rules.
To get colour-kinematic dual numerators one simply has to add the missing parts. However, there is
a stumbling block in doing this which is already seen at 4 points. The last section is a discussion of
how this diﬃculty may be overcome.

2 Colour-Kinematics duality

There are many good presentations of the colour-kinematics duality, to which we refer the reader for
more details. We will only need some basic information about this form of writing the YM scattering
amplitudes. We will mainly follow the original paper [1], with diﬀerences in notation.

2.1 Scattering amplitudes

The YM scattering amplitude

Aa1,...,an(k1, ǫ1; . . . ; kn, ǫn)

(1)

is an object that depends on (null k2
i ≡ (kiki) = 0) momenta ki, i = 1, . . . , n of n gluons being
scattered, as well as on the polarisation vectors ǫi. The polarisation vectors are null ǫ2
i = 0 and
transverse (ǫiki) = 0. The amplitude has free Lie algebra indices ai, allowing one to distinguish the
colour of the gluons that are scattered. As usual, using crossing symmetry it is assumed that all
particles are incoming, so that the momentum conservation reads Pi ki = 0.
The tree-level scattering amplitude is obtained by summing over all tree-level Feynman graphs
with n external legs, with the propagators for the external legs amputated. The polarisations ǫi are
inserted into the external legs. Each vertex contributes according to the Feynman rules, see below,
while each internal line contributes a factor of i/k2, where k is the momentum on that line, as well as
a factor of Kronecker delta for the Lie algebra indices.

2.2 The statement of colour-kinematics duality

The statement of duality consists of several sub statements. First, it says that it is possible to write
(1) as a sum of cubic graphs only. This part of the statement is to some extent trivial, because one
can always write the contributions from the quartic vertices in terms of some eﬀective cubic graphs,
see below on how to do this in practice. Thus, a part of the colour-kinematics duality statement is
that one can write (1) as

Aa1,...,an(k1, ǫ1; . . . ; kn, ǫn) = X

t∈ cubic trees

(kinematic factor)t Y

v

e

δaebe 1

.

(2)

Here v is the set of cubic vertices of the graph, and e is the set of internal edges. The momentum ke
is that on the internal edge e, as follows from the momentum conservation. It is a sum of a certain
subset of the external momenta ki. The quantity f abc is the Lie algebra structure constant. The Lie
algebra indices are labelled as follows. First, we have 3 Lie algebra indices av, bv, cv at each cubic
vertex v. Second, we have a pair of indices ae, be at each internal line e. The internal line indices
are to be thought of as being associated with the ends of the line. For example, all internal lines can
be oriented in some arbitrary way, and then each Lie algebra index on the internal line is either the
source of the line index or the target index. The Lie algebra indices of the structure constant are
to be taken as follows. They correspond to lines emanating from the vertex. If a line is an internal

3

line, then the Lie algebra index of the corresponding end of the line should be used. If a line is an
external line, then the corresponding index from the set a1, . . . , an should be used. All Lie algebra
indices associated to internal lines should be summed over in (2). Finally, the kinematic factor in (2)
depends on the graph topology, as well as on all the external data ki, ǫi. It is important to emphasise
that the kinematic factor does not have to be local in any sense. Thus, it is a quantity that depends
on all the external momenta and all the polarisations. Finally, our convention is that we have set the
YM coupling constant to unity (it is easy to reconstruct it by counting the vertices). We have also
omitted some factors of the imaginary unit, which are again reconstructible by counting.

As we have already said, a representation (2) can always be achieved starting from the Feynman
rules, but there are many ways of doing this. The non-trivial part of the colour-kinematics duality
statement is that it is possible to choose the kinematic factors in such a way as to satisfy an analog of
the Jacobi identity. Thus, it is clear that in (2) the kinematic factors as well as the propagators can
be stripped oﬀ, and then each graph carries the following colour factor

(colour)t = Y

where as before the sum over colour indices associated with all internal edges is assumed. These colour
factors then clearly satisfy the following Jacobi identity

(4)

The 3 graphs here can also be a part of a larger graph. The statement of the colur-kinematics duality
is then that it is possible to choose the kinematic factors (kinematic factor)t so as to satisfy the same
identity (4) as is satisﬁed by the colour factors.

2.3 Gravity as square of YM

Part of the importance of the colour-kinematic dual presentation (2) of the YM amplitudes is that, once
such a presentation is known, it is easy to obtain graviton scattering amplitudes. Thus, gravitons being
spin two particles, their polarisation vectors can be represented as squares of spin one polarisation
vectors hµν (k) = ǫµ(k)ǫν (k), where ǫµ(k) is a YM polarisation vector as is appropriate for a gluon of
momentum k. We remind the reader that for a massless particle in 4 dimensions there are two possible
polarisations both for YM and for gravitons. Thus, for either polarisation, the graviton polarisation
vectors is representable as the square of that of YM theory.

With the understanding that graviton polarisations are squares of those in YM theory, the state-
ment of gravity being a square of YM theory is as follows. The graviton scattering amplitudes can
be written in a form similar to (2), with the colour factors for each graph being replaced by another
copy of the kinematic factor

M(k1, h1; . . . ; kn, hn) = X

(5)

Once again, this formula misses the factor of Planck mass Mp to the power of the number of vertices,
as well as some factors of the imaginary unit, which are easy to reconstruct.

2.4 The puzzle of colour-kinematics

As we have already mentioned in the introduction, the fact that gravity is a square of YM theory, at
least at the level of on-shell scattering amplitudes, is to some extent explained by embedding both
theories into string theory. Gravity is then the closed string, while YM is an open string, and two
copies of the open string (disk) give the closed string (sphere).

From this perspective, the duality statement (2) with the kinematic factors satisfying the Jacobi
identity (4) is more puzzling than the statement that gravity equals YM squared. Indeed, the colour-
kinematics duality says that Yang-Mills theory itself is already a square, with its amplitudes being
formed from one copy of the kinematics and one copy of the colour factors. This statement can no
longer be explained by the open/closed string duality, as it says that in a certain sense the open string
is already is a square. The colour-kinematics duality thus seems more intriguing than its application
to gravity (5), and this is why in this paper we seek understanding of (2) rather than (5).

3 Feynman rules, YM bracket and the self-dual sector

The main point of this section is to establish notations. The novel aspects are as follows. We point
out that there is some freedom in choosing the gauge-ﬁxing term. This freedom is parametrised by an
anti-symmetric tensor. Availability of this freedom strengthens our later interpretation of structures
arising in YM theory in terms of the Drinfeld double.

Another novel aspect is our way of writing the cubic vertex (15), which makes prominent the role
of the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds with its Lie bracket. We also introduce what we refer to as the YM
bracket in this section. This is an anti-symmetric operation on vector ﬁelds that comes out from the
YM cubic vertex. This YM bracket does not satisfy the Jacobi identity (and this is why the statement
of colour-kinematics is non-trivial). In the next section we will compute its Jacobiator.

Finally, we provide a simple explanation for why the colour-kinematic duality follows from Feynman

rules for MHV amplitudes. This provides a simpliﬁed version of the story in [9].

3.1 The Lagrangian

The YM Lagrangian is

LYM =

(F a

Expanded around the trivial background (zero gauge ﬁeld) this gives

L(2) =

The quadratic part of the Lagrangian, when gauge-ﬁxed so as to cancel the second term, gives rise to
the usual Feynman gauge propagator.

3.2 Gauge-ﬁxing freedom

µ)2 to the Lagrangian so
As we have just mentioned, the usual gauge-ﬁxing is to add a multiple of (∂µAa
as to cancel the unwanted term in L(2). However, there is some freedom in the gauge-ﬁxing, which we
now exploit. Let C µν be an anti-symmetric tensor, which we assume to be independent of space-time
coordinates. We can then consider the following quantity

C = ∂µAa

(and thus the standard Feynman gauge propagator i/k2). However, this also contributes to the qubic

Below we shall see that the gauge-ﬁxing freedom (8) makes the developed below interpretation in
terms of Drinfeld double more compelling.

3.3 The cubic vertex

The cubic part of the Lagrangian (7) gives rise to 6 terms in the cubic vertex. These are most
instead of writing
conveniently written in the momentum space, and using placeholders. Thus,
1 Aµ2b
V abc
µ1µ2µ3(k1, k2, k3) for the vertex factor, we write the contraction V abc
. We
assume that all the momenta are incoming, so that the derivative gives a factor of ikµ. There is an
additional factor of i coming from in front of the action. Further, it is convenient to strip the colour,
and introduce placeholders with only a space-time index. Thus, we will write our placeholders as
Aa

µ1µ2µ3(k1, k2, k3)Aµ1a

2 Aµ3c

µ = taξµ. Then

where the kinematic factors are

v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = (ξ2k3)(ξ1ξ3) − (ξ1k3)(ξ2ξ3)
+(ξ3k1)(ξ2ξ1) − (ξ2k1)(ξ3ξ1) + (ξ1k2)(ξ3ξ2) − (ξ3k2)(ξ1ξ2).

(10)

(11)

Here (ξη) := ξµηµ ≡ ηµν ξµην is the Minkowski metric product of one-forms ξµ, ηµ. The quantity
v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) has the following properties. It is cyclically symmetric v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = v3(ξ2, ξ3, ξ1). It is
also anti-symmetric with respect to exchange of any two arguments v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = −v3(ξ2, ξ1, ξ3). It
should be kept in mind that each ﬁeld ξ comes with its associated momentum k, so when vector ﬁelds
are exchanged, so must be the momenta. Below we shall interpret the object (11) as a cochain in Lie
algebra cohomology.

3.4 Lie bracket

Because we have the Minkowski metric in our disposal, we can identify the space of 1-forms on the
manifold with the space of vector ﬁelds. We will use this identiﬁcation everywhere, thinking about
objects ξµ as either vector ﬁelds or forms, as is convenient in each particular context. We will only
diﬀerentiate between 1-forms and vector ﬁelds where this is important.

Let us consider the Lie bracket of two vector ﬁelds

Importantly, it satisﬁes the Jacobi identity

[ξ1, ξ2] := (ξ1∂)ξ2 − (ξ2∂)ξ1.

[ξ1, [ξ2, ξ3]] + [ξ2, [ξ3, ξ1]] + [ξ3, [ξ1, ξ2]] = 0.

(12)

(13)

For our purposes, it will be more convenient to write everything in momentum space. Replacing the
partial derivative with the corresponding momentum vector (and omitting a factor of imaginary unit)
we have

[ξ1, ξ2] = (ξ1k2)ξ2 − (ξ2k1)ξ1.

(14)

6

This is the expression for the Lie bracket that will be used on most occasions.

Using the momentum conservation, it is not hard to see that the kinematic factor v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) can

be written in terms of the Lie bracket in the following way

v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = ([ξ1, ξ2]ξ3) + ([ξ2, ξ3]ξ1) + ([ξ3, ξ1]ξ2).

(15)

We ﬁnd it striking that the cubic vertex of YM can be written using the ﬂat metric and the Lie bracket
of vector ﬁelds. This suggests that the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds, which is the Lie algebra of the
group of diﬀeomorphisms on our manifold, has something to do with the structure of the gauge theory.
We will work out the contribution from the quadratic vertex, as well as those from the C-dependent
gauge-ﬁxing terms below, after we introduce some additional concepts from Lie algebra cohomology
theory.

3.5 The new bracket

As we have seen above, the YM cubic vertex deﬁnes a certain kinematic factor v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3), which can
be viewed as completely anti-symmetric tensor evaluated on 3 vector ﬁelds. We would like to interpret
this kinematic factor as a new bracket. Thus, we give it a sense of direction, and view it as the result
of a certain new bracket of vector ﬁelds ξ1, ξ2, later contracted with ξ3

[, ]Y M : Λ2T M → T M,

([ξ1, ξ2]Y M ξ3) := v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3).

(16)

To write an explicit expression for the new bracket, we can use the momentum conservation

k3 = −k1 − k2 so that only the momenta k1, k2 appear. We get

[ξ1, ξ2]Y M = 2(ξ1k2)ξ2 − 2(ξ2k1)ξ1 + (k1 − k2)(ξ1ξ2) + (ξ1k1)ξ2 − (ξ2k2)ξ1.

(17)

This operation is anti-symmetric, and thus maps the anti-symmetric second power of the tangent
bundle to the tangent bundle, as indicated. However, unlike the Lie bracket, the bracket just intro-
duced does not satisfy Jacobi identity, as we will explicitly compute below. It is not obvious from the
expression (17) that the left-hand-side of (16) is totally anti-symmetric, but this is made obvious by
the expression (15).

An important property of the new bracket, obvious from its expression via (15) is its symmetry

with respect to the inner product on the Lie algebra given by the metric

([ξ1, ξ2]Y M ξ3) = ([ξ2, ξ3]Y M ξ1) = ([ξ3, ξ1]Y M ξ2).

(18)

This is a property useful in explicit computations, such as the one of the Jacobiator below.

3.6 Colour-Kinematics duality for the YM self-dual sector

Here we will give a simple explanation for why the colour-kinematics duality is true for the self-dual
sector of YM theory. The basic observation here is that in the self-dual sector, the YM bracket as
deﬁned above coincides with the Lie bracket, which does satisfy the Jacobi identity. This establishes
the colour-kinematics duality in the self-dual sector, as was also done in [9] in a related, but apparently
more involved fashion.

We now outline the main idea of our argument. It easy to show using the spinor methods, that for
polarisation vectors of gluons of the same helicity, the following statements are true. First, as for any
polarisation vectors, these polarisations are transverse (ǫk) = 0. Second, the product of any two such
polarisation vectors is zero (ǫ1ǫ2) = 0. This would not be true if we dealt with polarisation vectors
corresponding to two diﬀerent helicities. Finally, and most importantly, the Lie bracket of two such

7

polarisation vectors gives a vector with similar properties, i.e. it is transverse and orthogonal to any
other polarisation vector of the same helicity

([ǫ1, ǫ2](k1 + k2)) = 0,

([ǫ1, ǫ2]ǫ3) = 0.

(19)

The ﬁrst of these properties follows from general considerations, while the second needs a simple
computation to be proved. The ﬁrst property follows from the fact that the Lie bracket preserves the
space of transverse vector ﬁelds, i.e. the Lie bracket of two transverse vector ﬁelds is again transverse.
This is a well-known fact, which can also be conﬁrmed by a simple computation.

We now sketch a proof of the second of the properties in (19). Let us take the helicity in question

to be negative. In our conventions this means that the corresponding helicity spinor is given by

ǫAA′ =

qAkA′
(1q)

,

(20)

where (1q) ≡ 1AqA is the spinor contraction, and qA is the negative helicity reference spinor. The
quantity kA′ is the momentum spinor such that the gluon null momentum is written as kAA′ = kAkA′.
The Lie bracket of two such polarisation vectors is then computed as

[ǫ1, ǫ2]AA′ =

qB1B ′2B2B ′

(1q)

qA2A′
(2q)

−

qB2B ′1B1B ′

(2q)

qA1A′
(1q)

= qA

[12]

(1q)(2q)

(1E1A′ + 2E2A′) qE.

(21)

Here [21] ≡ 2A′
1A′ is the primed spinor contraction. We use the notation k1A ≡ 1A, and similarly
for the primed spinors. The most important thing about the bracket (21) to be noticed is that the
result is again proportional to the reference spinor qA. This immediately implies that the bracket is
orthogonal to any other helicity vector, which is the second property in (19). Let us also compute the
projection of the bracket (21) onto the momentum vector (1 + 2)AA′, to check the ﬁrst property (for
which we gave an independent argument above). We have

[ǫ1, ǫ2]AA′(1 + 2)AA′

=

[12]

(1q)(2q)

(1 + 2)EA′qE(1 + 2)AA′

qA = 0.

(22)

The last equality follows because we have the product of a primed spinor (1 + 2)EA′qE with itself.
This conﬁrms the ﬁrst property in (19).

What we have established is that the space of vectors of the type (20) is preserved by the Lie
bracket, in the sense that the Lie bracket of two such vectors is again a vector of the same type. This
immediately shows that the YM bracket (17) of two such vector ﬁelds coincides with their Lie bracket
(times two).
Indeed, the YM bracket on vector ﬁelds that are transverse and that are orthogonal
to each other (ξ1ξ2) = 0 is twice the Lie bracket. This immediately applies to vector ﬁelds that are
negative helicity polarisation vectors, and shows that on them the YM bracket reduces to the Lie
bracket. Lie bracket satisﬁes the Jacobi identity, which immediately implies that the YM bracket
evaluated on negative helicity vector ﬁelds also satisﬁes it. This establishes the colour-kinematics
duality for the YM self-dual sector (at 4 points) in a way that is analogous to arguments in [9], but
more directly.

It is easy to generalise the above argument to an arbitrary number of points. The main property
that we need is that the space of vector ﬁelds of the form ξAA′ = qAξA′, for some spinor ξA′ and with
a ﬁxed reference spinor qA is closed under the Lie bracket. This is essentially the same computation
as in (21). Thus, Lie bracket of two transverse vector ﬁelds of this form is again transverse and is of
this form. Then the YM bracket coincides with the Lie bracket, and this happens for an arbitrary
number of repeated applications of the YM bracket. Given that the Lie bracket satisﬁes Jacobi, this
establishes the property (4) for the numerators at arbitrary number of gluons.

Finally, we remark that we have justiﬁably ignored the 4-valent YM vertex in these considerations,
as it is known that this vertex cannot contribute to amplitudes when all helicities are the same. This
follows from a simple count of the number of reference spinors qA that needs to be contracted.

4 The Jacobiator of the YM bracket

The purpose of this section is to explain the colour-kinematics duality at 4 points. We provide more
information on the bracket on vector ﬁelds as deﬁned by YM theory Feynman rules, work out the
contributions from the gauge-ﬁxing terms (9) and interpret these contributions. We also work out
the contribution from the 4-valent vertex. The main result of this section is the computation of the
Jacobiator of the YM bracket, which measures the failure of the Jacobi identity to be satisﬁed. We
ﬁnd that the Jacobiator is cancelled by the 4-valent vertex, which explains why the colour-kinematics
works at 4 points. We provide a Lie-algebraic explanation of all these facts in the next section.

4.1 Metric is not diﬀ-invariant

We start by noting that the diﬀerence between the new bracket (17) and the Lie bracket (14) stems
from the fact that the ﬂat metric used in the deﬁnition (15) is not diﬀeomorphism invariant. Indeed,
an invariant metric on the Lie algebra satisﬁes

([Z, X]Y ) + (X[Z, Y ]) = 0.

(23)

If this were the case here, which it is not, then we would have all three terms in (15) equal, and
the bracket deﬁned by (15) was just three times the Lie bracket. The diﬀerence thus stems from the
non-invariance of the ﬂat metric under the diﬀeos, as claimed.

All this can be rephrased as follows. We have the Lie bracket (14) on vector ﬁelds. We build from
it (15) the kinematic factor v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) that is completely anti-symmetric in its 3 entries, as it should
be as it comes from YM Feynman rules, where it is to be multiplied by another anti-symmetric tensor
— the structure constant. We can only build v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) with the help of the metric. But this metric
is not invariant in the sense of (23), and so the kinematic invariant v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) does not coincide
with ([ξ1, ξ2]ξ3). Instead, the kinematic factor introduces a new bracket (16) satisfying (18). But this
bracket does not satisfy the Jacobi identity.

4.2 Gauge-ﬁxing part

We now perform similar operations with the cubic vertex coming from the gauge-ﬁxing, see (9). We
get the following (totally anti-symmetric in the 3 vector ﬁelds) kinematic factor

vC
3 (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = (Cξ1ξ2)(k3ξ3) + (Cξ2ξ3)(k1ξ1) + (Cξ3ξ1)(k2ξ2).

(24)

Note that this kinematic factor vanishes if all 3 vector ﬁelds are transverse (kiξi) = 0. Note also
that we do not assume this on-shell condition in what follows. For later purposes, we give another
expression for vC

3 . Using the momentum conservation, it is easy to see that

− vC

3 (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) = (C[ξ1, ξ2]ξ3) + (C[ξ3, ξ1]ξ2) + (C[ξ2, ξ3]ξ1).

(25)

Note the similar of this with (11). Thus, the anti-symmetric tensor C above plays role analogous to
the metric in (11). We will interpret this in terms of twists below.

This kinematic factor can similarly be viewed as the result of some bracket of vector ﬁelds ξ1, ξ2

contracted with ξ3

where

[, ]C : Λ2T M → T M,

([ξ1, ξ2]Cξ3) := vC

3 (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3)

[ξ1, ξ2]C = (k1ξ1)iξ2 C − (k2ξ2)iξ1C − (Cξ1ξ2)(k1 + k2),

(26)

(27)

Here (iξC)µ := ξνCνµ is the interior product. One can also view (27) as a twist of the bracket (17) by
an element C of Λ2T ∗M .

4.3 Lie algebra cohomology

It is possible to understand the expression (24) as an ”exact” expression, with an appropriate notion
of exactness. For this purpose, it is useful to introduce some basic notions of Lie algebra cohomology,
as this mathematics is very useful to understand what is happening. In our case the Lie algebra is
that of vector ﬁelds on the manifold. Introduce the notion of cochains which are multi-linear functions

Then the coboundary of an n-cochain is the (n + 1)-cochain δf given by

f : ΛnT M → R.

(δf )(ξ1, . . . , ξn+1) := X

i<j

(−1)i+jf ([ξi, ξj], ξ1, . . . , ˆξi, . . . , ˆξj . . . , ξn+1).

The hat indicates that the argument must be omitted. The coboundary operator is nilpotent

δ2 = 0

and deﬁnes the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (in our case with values in R).

4.4 Twist as a gauge transformation

Let us now consider a 2-cochain on Λ2T M constructed using C ∈ Λ2T ∗M

C(ξ1, ξ2) := (Cξ1ξ2).

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

As is easy to check, the kinematic factor vC
from the gauge-ﬁxing is then just the coboundary of C:

3 (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) that arises as a contribution to the cubic vertex

vC
3 = δC.

(32)

One needs to use the momentum conservation to check this identity.

4.5 Coboundary of constant cochains is vanishing on-shell

As we can see from (24), the coboundary of C from the above example vanishes whenever all 3 vector
ﬁelds are transverse. This is a general property, as we shall now see. As an illustration, let us compute
the coboundary of some 3-cochain f (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3). We have

(δf )(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) = −f ([ξ1, ξ4], ξ2, ξ3) + f ([ξ2, ξ4], ξ1, ξ3) − f ([ξ3, ξ4], ξ1, ξ2)
−f ([ξ1, ξ2], ξ3, ξ4) + f ([ξ1, ξ3], ξ2, ξ4) − f ([ξ2, ξ3], ξ1, ξ4).

(33)

Let us now assume that the cochain f does not contain any derivative operators in it, i.e. is just some
completely anti-symmetric rank 3 tensor with vector ﬁelds inserted into it. In this case we can use
the explicit expression for the Lie bracket and the linearity of the cochain to write

f ([ξ1, ξ4], ξ2, ξ3) = (ξ1k4)f (ξ4, ξ2, ξ3) − (ξ4k1)f (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3).

(34)

It is important that this formula would not be true if the cochain also contains derivative operators,
as such derivative operators, when acting on [ξ1, ξ4] will need to be replaced by k1 + k4 and the above
property would not hold. Keeping this in mind, collecting terms with cochains of the same arguments,
and using the momentum conservation, we get

(δf )(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) = (ξ1k1)f (ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) − (ξ2k2)f (ξ1, ξ3, ξ4)
+(ξ3k3)f (ξ1, ξ2, ξ4) − (ξ4k4)f (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3).

(35)

This vanishes when all 4 vector ﬁelds are transverse. Once again, this formula is only true if the
cochain f does not contain any derivative operators. E.g. it would not be true for the cochain v3.

10

4.6 Remark

The expression (15) for the YM cubic vertex 3-cochain v3 allows one to think about it as being the
coboundary of a function on T M ⊗S T M given by the metric

η(ξ1, ξ2) := (ξ1ξ2).

(36)

Even though the coboundary operation is only deﬁned above on cochains, which η is not, we can deﬁne

(δη)(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) := ([ξ1, ξ2]ξ3) + ([ξ2, ξ3]ξ1) + ([ξ3, ξ1]ξ2).

(37)

Thus, we have mapped a symmetric function into a completely anti-symmetric one. It is clear that
with this deﬁnition δη = v3. But because η is not a cochain we have δv3 6= 0. The fact that in this
instance δ2 6= 0 is perhaps the reason not to think of v3 as a coboundary. But we found the analogy
too strong to resist mentioning it.

This remark once again signiﬁes the fact that the only structures that go into the construction of
the YM cubic vertex are: (i) the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds with its Lie bracket (14); (ii) the ﬂat metric
η that can be used to contract two vector ﬁelds. The cubic vertex 3-cochain is then the coboundary
(37) of the metric, in the sense of Lie algebra cohomology theory.

4.7 Properties

We now list some properties of [, ]Y M . We have for the transverse part of our bracket

([ξ1, ξ2]Y M (k1 + k2)) = (ξ1k2)(ξ2k2) − (ξ1k1)(ξ2k1) + (k2

1 − k2

2)(ξ1ξ2).

(38)

This means that when ξ1, ξ2 are transverse and k2
of the bracket of two such vector ﬁelds is also transverse.

1 = k2

2 = 0 (both ﬁelds are on-shell), then the result

It is also interesting to compute the result of the bracket of one vector ﬁeld with the longitudinal

part of the other. Thus, we replace ξ1 = k1. The result is then

[k1, ξ2]Y M = −(cid:0)k2

2ξ2 − k2(ξ2k2)(cid:1) + (cid:0)(k1 + k2)2ξ2 − (k1 + k2)(ξ2(k1 + k2))(cid:1) .

(39)

The ﬁrst term here is a multiple of the orthogonal projection of ξ2 away from k2, and the second term
is a multiple of the orthogonal projection of ξ2 away from k1 + k2. In particular, if ξ2 is transverse
and on-shell, then (39) is transverse.

4.8

Interpreting the quartic vertex

The quartic part of the Lagrangian (7) gives rise to 24 terms. They can be grouped according to how
the Lie algebra structure constants contract. There are exactly 3 diﬀerent contractions, corresponding
to the s, t and u channels. We can then put the contribution of the quartic vertex into form (2)
appropriate for colour-kinematics duality. Thus, depending on how the Lie algebra indices contract,
we interpret each contribution to the quartic vertex factor as corresponding to either s, t or u channel.
We then multiply and divide by the corresponding propagator. This puts the contribution of the
quartic vertex into form of a sum over three 3-valent graphs, as in (2), with certain kinematic factors
to be spelled out below.

Above we have extracted a certain kinematic bracket (15) from the YM Feynman rules. This was
done by stripping oﬀ the colour factor of the 3-vertex. When we are to compute the Jacobiator of the
YM bracket (15), we will be adding contributions of diﬀerent 3-valent graphs, essentially doing the
sum as in (2) but with the colour and the propagator factors stripped oﬀ.

Our task here is to compare the kinematic Jacobiator (to be computed later) with the similar
object that can be extracted from the quartic vertex. To extract this we take the quartic vertex factor
and multiply and divide each term in it by an appropriate (ki + kj)2/i according to its colour factor.
We then strip both the propagator and the colour factor and add the resulting quantities. It is this
object that can be compared to the Jacobiator of the YM vertex (15).

11

4.9

4-cochain

Taking into account an extra i from in front of the action, the quartic part of the Lagrangian gives
rise to the following structure

v4(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) = (k1 + k2)2 ((ξ1ξ3)(ξ2ξ4) − (ξ2ξ3)(ξ1ξ4))
+(k2 + k3)2 ((ξ2ξ1)(ξ3ξ4) − (ξ3ξ1)(ξ2ξ4))
+(k1 + k3)2 ((ξ1ξ4)(ξ3ξ2) − (ξ3ξ4)(ξ1ξ2)) .

(40)

It is not hard to check that v4 is actually a 4-cochain, i.e. completely anti-symmetric.

4.10 An identity

Even though the 4-cochain (40) is obtained by adding 3 diﬀerent contributions of the 4-vertex factor
with colours stripped and missing propagators supplied, each term in (40) cannot be interpreted in
terms of some product of cubic vertex contributions. However, the whole object (40) can be interpreted
in such a way, and this is to play an important role in the next section.

To establish another expression for (40) we ﬁrst derive a simple consequence of the momentum

conservation. Thus, consider

(k1 + k2)2 − (k2 + k3)2 = k2

1 + 2(k1k2) − k2

3 − 2(k2k3).

(41)

Using the momentum conservation k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 0 we can write the same quantity in a diﬀerent
way as

(k3 + k4)2 − (k1 + k4)2 = k2

3 + 2(k3k4) − k2

1 − 2(k1k4).

(42)

Adding these two expressions we get

(k1 + k2)2 − (k2 + k3)2 = (k1k2) − (k2k3) + (k3k4) − (k1k4) = ((k1 − k3)(k2 − k4)).

(43)

Using this, we can rewrite (40) as follows

− v4(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) = ((k1 − k2)(k3 − k4))(ξ1ξ2)(ξ3ξ4) + ((k3 − k1)(k2 − k4))(ξ3ξ1)(ξ2ξ4)
+((k1 − k4)(k2 − k3))(ξ1ξ4)(ξ2ξ3).

(44)

The importance of this identity is that every term here can be interpreted as a product of two cubic
vertices of a new type, with each cubic vertex contributing as the bracket

[ξ1, ξ2]∗ := (k1 − k2)(ξ1ξ2).

(45)

This fact will be of importance in the next section, when we interpret the objects that we encountered
in terms of the Drinfeld double of the group of diﬀeomorphisms.

4.11 Gauge-ﬁxing 4-cochain

The gauge-ﬁxing term gives, similarly

4 (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) = (k1 + k2)2(Cξ1ξ2)(Cξ3ξ4) + (k2 + k3)2(Cξ2ξ3)(Cξ1ξ4)
vC
+(k1 + k3)2(Cξ1ξ3)(Cξ4ξ2).

(46)

It can be viewed as a twist of the quartic vertex by an element C of Λ2T ∗M .

12

4.12 Jacobiator

We now perform the computation of the left-hand-side of the would be Jacobi identity for (17). We
call this object the Jacobiator J : Λ3T M → T M

J[ξ1, ξ2, ξ3] := [ [ξ1, ξ2]Y M , ξ3]Y M + [ [ξ2, ξ3]Y M , ξ1]Y M + [ [ξ3, ξ1]Y M , ξ2]Y M

(47)

The most convenient way to represent the answer for this quantity is to take its product with some
vector ﬁeld ξ4

J(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) := (J[ξ1, ξ2, ξ3]ξ4).

(48)

The resulting object is a 4-cochain, which can be seen using the symmetry property (18) of the bracket.
We have

J(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) = ([ξ1, ξ2]Y M [ξ3, ξ4]Y M ) + ([ξ2, ξ3]Y M [ξ1, ξ4]Y M ) + ([ξ3, ξ1]Y M [ξ2, ξ4]Y M ),

(49)

which is obviously a 4-cochain.

4.13 Main result

We have come to the main result of this section, which is an explicit expression for the Jacobiator of
the YM bracket. After a somewhat laborious explicit computation we get

where δ′ is deﬁned as

J = −v4 + δ′v3,

(δ′f )(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) := (ξ1k1)f (ξ2, ξ3, ξ4) − (ξ2k2)f (ξ1, ξ3, ξ4)
+(ξ3k3)f (ξ1, ξ2, ξ4) − (ξ4k4)f (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3).

We remind the reader that on 3-cochains that do not have any derivative operators inside, this would

coincide with the result of the action of the coboundary operator δ, see (35).
are diﬀerent, and only δ is nilpotent. The importance of δ′ is that its result is always vanishing on
transverse vector ﬁelds, as is clear from the above expression.

The equality (50) is our main result in this section. In the computation that leads to this result, it
is easy to recognise the v4 part on the right-hand-side, in its form (44). It takes more work to rewrite
all other terms as δ′v3.

The formula (50) tells us that the failure of the Jacobi identity for [, ]Y M to be satisﬁed is ”cor-
rected” by the quartic vertex. It cancels the ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side, and then the Jacobi
is satisﬁed when all 4 external vector ﬁelds are transverse. This explains why the colour-kinematics
duality works at 4 points.

4.14 Jacobiator with gauge

Let us now perform a computation similar to (4) but using the cubic vertex twisted by C. Thus, we
introduce a new bracket

Y M : Λ2T M → T M,

([ξ1, ξ2]C

Y M ξ3) := v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) + vC

As before, the quartic vertex precisely cancels the nontrivial part on the right-hand-side of (53),
with all other parts vanishing on-shell. The terms in the ﬁrst line are zero on-shell being exact, while
the terms on lines 2,3,4 are zero when all the 4 momenta are null.

5 Drinfeld doubles and twists

The purpose of this section is to introduce concepts that later allow us to interpret the result (50) in
terms of a certain twist of the Drinfeld double of the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds. Thus, we review
some basics about (classical) Drinfeld doubles. Most of the material in this Section is standard. A
source on Lie bi-algebras we found useful is [11].

There is also an unconventional point about our presentation here, as we need to describe the twist
of the double by a symmetric tensor. Usually, the literature considers only twists by an anti-symmetric
tensor because these do not take one out of the setting of Lie bi-algebras. However, this is insuﬃcient
for our purposes, as we will need to twist with a metric, which is a symmetric tensor. The resulting
description is rather straightforward, but we were unable to ﬁnd it in the literature.

5.1 Two descriptions

Drinfeld’s construction arose as an axiomatisation of the quantum inverse scattering method. We refer
the reader to Drinfeld’s original papers [12], [13] for more details.

Drinfeld’s construction is quantum, but admits a classical limit. We will only need this classical
construction in the present paper. The main structure arising in the classical limit is that of what [14]
calls a double Lie algebra. This is a Lie algebra with a second bracket on it also satisfying the Jacobi
identity. One can get such double Lie algebras with the help of the classical r-matrices satisfying the
classical Yang-Baxter equation.

For our applications, and also in the construction of the Drinfeld double, it is best to think about
the second bracket as being deﬁned not on the original vector space, but on its dual. A bracket on the
dual space is then equivalent to an operation δ : g → Λ2
g on the original Lie algebra. This motivates
the notion of Lie bi-algebras that Drinfeld uses.

It is convenient to have both pictures: the Lie bi-algebra picture where one works with a single
∗ as well as brackets
space g and two operations on it, and another picture where one works with g ⊕ g
on both spaces. The later description is the Drinfeld double proper. Some computations are easier
in the Lie bi-algebras setting, some in the Drinfeld double picture. We start with the Lie bi-algebra
description.

14

5.2 Lie bi-algebras

This description interprets the bracket on the dual space g

∗ as a 1-cocycle on the original space g.

Deﬁnition 1. A Lie bi-algebra is a tuple (g, δ), where g is a Lie algebra and δ : g → Λ2
such that

g is a 1-cocycle

Alt(δ ⊗ id)δ(x) = 0.

(56)

Here the notion of 1-cocycle is as follows. It is a linear map δ : g → Λ2

g satisfying δ([x, y]) =
[x, δ(y)] − [y, δ(x)]. The operator Alt gives a sum over permutations with signs. The property (56) is
called co-Jacobi identity. The 1-cocycle condition above can be viewed as the condition of compatibility
of the bracket [, ] on g with the co-bracket δ.

5.3 Twisting

An important source of Lie bi-algebras is the twisting procedure. Thus, let r ∈ Λ2
satisfying

g be an object

Alt(δ ⊗ id)r = 0,

[r12, r13] + [r12, r23] + [r13, r23] = 0.

(57)

The second of these equations is known as the classical Yang-Baxter equation (CYBE). An object
satisfying these properties is referred to as the classical r-matrix.

Lemma 1. The object

δr(x) = δ(x) + [x ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ x, r]

(58)

is a 1-cocycle, satisfying (56), and thus deﬁnes a new Lie bi-algebra.

This Lie bi-algebra is said to be obtained from the original one by twisting via r. The 1-cocycle
condition is not hard to check. It is harder to check the co-Jacobi identity (56), and both properties
(57) are necessary for co-Jacobi to be satisﬁed.

g. This guarantees that (58) gives an operator mapping g into Λ2

Remark. It is important that r in the above construction is taken to be an anti-symmetric tensor
r ∈ Λ2
g. We could also consider
symmetric r and change the sign in (58) to continue to get an operator from g to Λ2
g. However,
it is not hard to check that this operator would fail to be a 1-cocycle, i.e.
it would not satisfy
δ[x, y] = [x, δ(y)] − [y, δ(x)]. This is why we can only deﬁne twists of Lie bi-algebras by anti-symmetric
r-matrices. This remark is important for below, because we will need to consider certain twists by
symmetric tensors.

5.4 Quasi-triangular Drinfeld doubles

One can start with a trivial Lie bi-algebra for which δ = 0, and twist this bi-algebra into a non-
trivial one with an r-matrix satisfying the CYBE. Lie bi-algebras obtained in this way are called
quasi-triangular. This is an important source of Lie bi-algebras.

5.5 The Drinfeld double description

In this description one interprets the 1-cocycle δ in terms of a bracket on the dual space g
done as follows.

∗. This is

15

Let g be a (ﬁnite-dimensional) Lie algebra, and ei ∈ g be some basis. Its Lie bracket can be written

as [ei, ej] = C k
quadratic equation satisﬁed by the structure constants

ijek, where C k

C m

il C l

jk + C m

jl C l

ki + C m

kl C l

ij = 0.

(59)

Let us now introduce the dual space g
δ : g → Λ2

g as deﬁning a bracket on the dual space g

∗ via

∗ with basis ei : ei(ej) = δi

j. We can interpret the operation

[ei, ej] = f ij

k ek

with the structure constants f ij

k being deﬁned by

δ(ei) = f kl

i ek ⊗ el.

(60)

(61)

It is not hard to see that the Jacobi identity for f is then (56). It is also not hard to check that the
1-cocycle condition becomes

f kl
m C m

ij + f km

i C l

jm − f lm

i C k

jm − f km

j C l

im + f lm

j C k

im = 0,

which can be viewed as a compatibility between the brackets in g and g

∗.

Deﬁnition 2. The space D = g ⊕ g

∗ with the bracket deﬁned by

[ei, ej] = C k

ijek,

[ei, ej] = f ij

k ek,

is called the Drinfeld double.

[ei, ej] = −C j

ikek + f jk

i ek

(62)

(63)

Lemma 2. The Drinfeld double is a Lie algebra, i.e. the bracket deﬁned in (63) satisﬁes the Jacobi
identity.

A proof is by veriﬁcation, using both Jacobi identities as well as (62).

Lemma 3. The following symmetric tensor

g = ei ⊗ ei + ei ⊗ ei ∈ D ⊗ D,

(64)

with the summation over i implied, is an invariant metric on the Drinfeld double in the sense of (23).

A proof is simple veriﬁcation. We note that the availability of an invariant metric on D, which is

not necessarily available in g, is part of the reason why the double D is an interesting object.

5.6 Twisting at the level of the Drinfeld double

To understand the meaning of the twist in (24), let us start with the trivial Drinfeld double with
commuting dual space generators [ei, ej] = 0. This trivial double exists for any Lie algebra. Let us
then take an arbitrary element r ∈ Λ2

g. We can decompose it in the basis

r = rijei ⊗ ej.

We then deﬁne a new basis in the dual space

ui := ei + rijej.

We leave the Lie algebra generators unchanged ui = ei. We have

[ui, uj] = [ei, ej + rjkek] = −C j

ik(uk − rkses) + rjkC s

ikes = −C j

ikuk + f jk

i ek,

16

(65)

(66)

(67)

where

We have used the anti-symmetry of rij here. We also have that the new generators ui no longer
commute

f jk
i = rjlC k

il − rklC j

[ui, uj] = [ei, rjkek] + [rikek, ej] + [rikek, rjlel] = rjkC i

kmem − rikC j

We now use the classical Yang-Baxter equation (57) to cancel the terms quadratic in r and get

[ui, uj] = f ij

k uk,

with f ij
δ given by the second term in (58).

k given by (68). This coincides with the bracket introduced earlier via (60), with the co-bracket

The above construction justiﬁes the earlier introduced terminology of twists. Indeed, the twist
(24) is now interpreted as a simple change of basis (66) in the Drinfeld double. The new generators ui
are then no longer commuting, but instead form a Lie algebra with structure constants f ij
k , provided
the twisting r-matrix satisﬁes the CYBE.

5.7 Twisting by a symmetric tensor

As we have already mentioned above, at the level of Lie bi-algebras the twisting (58) can only be done
by an anti-symmetric r-matrix r ∈ Λ2
∗ one
can consider changes of the basis of the type (66) generated by an arbitrary tensor. It is clear that
whatever change of basis is performed, the Drinfeld double D remains a Lie algebra. However, what
will happen in the process of such twists is that the twisted generators, in general, will not form Lie
sub-algebras. Thus, twists by arbitrary tensors take one out of the setting of Lie bi-algebras, while
preserving the fact that D is a Lie algebra.

g. However, at the level of the Drinfeld double D = g ⊕ g

Let us illustrate this for the twists that will be of importance for our construction below. Thus,
let ηij be a symmetric tensor, and ηij be its inverse. We start with a trivial Drinfeld double with
commuting dual generators [ei, ej] = 0. We then twist

The inverse of these transformations is

ui := ei + ηijej,

ui := ei − ηijej.

ei =

1
2

(ui − ηijuj),

ei =

1
2

(ui + ηijuj).

(71)

(72)

Let us compute, for future reference, the invariant metric (64) on the Drinfeld double on the new
generators. We can write the metric (64) as

with all other products being zero. This gives

hui, uji = 2ηij,

hui, uji = −2ηij,

hui, uji = 0.

hei, eji = δj
i ,

(73)

(74)

Thus, with respect to the invariant metric on D the two subspaces spanned by ui, ui are now orthog-
onal. Note that now, once embedded into the Drinfeld double, the metric ηij, which is of course not
an invariant metric on the original Lie algebra, becomes the invariant metric on generators ui, uj.

For future convenience, let us introduce a notation for the parts of D that are spanned by ui, ui

u := Span(ui),

⊥ := Span(ui).
u

(75)

The second notation here is justiﬁed, because ui are indeed orthogonal to ui with respect to the
invariant metric on D. Thus, we can write

D = u ⊕ u

⊥.

5.8 A new bracket

We now compute the brackets between the new generators. We have

[ui, uj] = [ei + ηikek, ej + ηjlel] = (cid:16)C m
ij (um − ηmnun) −
C m

ηjlC l

im(um + ηmnun) +

ij em − ηjlC l

jmηil(cid:17) , Aijk =

1
2 (cid:0)C m

ij ηmk + C m

ik ηjm − C m

jkηim(cid:1) .

Projecting the right-hand-side on the u part of D we get a new bracket

[ui, uj]η := [ui, uj](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u

= ηC k

ijuk.

(77)

(78)

(79)

5.9 A diﬀerent representation

It is useful to write the above bracket in a diﬀerent form. Thus, let us introduce vectors a = aiui. We
then have two possible ways to commute such objects. In the ﬁrst of these, we remember that ui is
a vector in the Drinfeld double given by (71), and use the Drinfeld double bracket [, ]. In the second,
we ﬁrst project the vector a onto g and then take the bracket of the result. Thus, let us deﬁne

[a1, a2]′ := [a1|g, a2|g] = ai

1aj

2C k

ijek.

(80)

We can then rewrite the bracket (79) in terms of this bracket. The bracket (79) is simply the projection
of the bracket in the double onto the u part. This can be selected by taking the product with another
element of u. Thus, we have

h[a1, a2], a3i = h[a1, a2]η, a3i = h[a1, a2]′, a3i + h[a2, a3]′, a1i + h[a3, a1]′, a2i,

(81)

where to write the second equality we have used the deﬁnition (80), as well as (78). We recognise
exactly the same structure (16), (15) as one deﬁning what we called the YM bracket above.

5.10 Jacobi identity after the twist

We have found that the bracket (81) arises in the process of twisting (71) the Drinfeld double. The
information that goes into the twist is that of a symmetric tensor ηij and its inverse. This is also
the information that is necessary to deﬁne the bracket (81). There is now no mystery as to why the
bracket (81) does not satisfy the Jacobi identity, and the Drinfeld double construction also shows that
a certain version of the Jacobi identity is still satisﬁed.

To see what happens, let us compute the Jacobiator of elements a1,2,3 with a1 = ai

1ui, etc., and
project on the fourth such element. The result is of course zero, because the original bracket satisﬁes
Jacobi. We have

0 = h[[a1, a2], a3], a4i + h[[a2, a3], a1], a4i + h[[a3, a1], a2], a4i
= h[a1, a2], [a3, a4]i + h[a2, a3], [a1, a4]i + h[a3, a1], [a2, a4]i.

(82)

We have used the invariance of the metric to obtain the second expression. As we see from (77), the
result of each bracket here contains part in the subspace spanned by ui, as well as in the subspace
spanned by ui. We now use the fact that the [, ]η bracket is just the projection of the full bracket on

18

the space spanned by ui, as well as orthogonality of the spaces spanned by ui and ui. There is also a
relative minus sign in the Drinfeld double metric (74). Dividing by 2, we get the following identity

ηC n

ηC m
ij

jlηmn
= AijmAklnηmn + AjkmAilnηmn + AkimAjlnηmn.

klηmn + ηC m
jk

ηC n

ilηmn + ηC m
ki

ηC n

(83)

The ﬁrst line here is just the Jacobiator cochain (49), while the second line is the measure of the
failure of the Jacobi identity for the bracket (81) to be satisﬁed.

It is worth representing this identity in graphical terms. Let straight lines represent the space
spanned by ui, and straight lines with a dot in the middle represent the projection onto the space
spanned by ui. The above identity then takes the form of the usual Jacobi identity (4), but one has
to keep in mind that the intermediate channel can be either in the space spanned by ui or in the
⊥ part of
orthogonal space. One also has to keep in mind a relative minus sign of the metric in the u
D. So, we get

In the next section we will compare this identity to (50) that we have derived for the YM bracket.

6 The Drinfeld double of the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds

This section interprets the result (50) in terms of the Drinfeld double of the Lie algebra of diﬀeomor-
phisms. We will see that the proper way to understand the appearance of the YM bracket, as well as
the quartic vertex and its role in making the Jacobi identity in the form (50) satisﬁed is by a twist of
the Drinfeld double. We have already identiﬁed the required twist in the previous section, see (71).
In this section we continue to work at 4 points, postponing the situation at an arbitrary number of
gluons till the next section.

We would like to point out from the outset that the Drinfeld double that we start with is the
k = 0, see previous section for details. Such

trivial one, where the bracket on the dual space is zero f ij
a double exists for any Lie algebra.

6.1 The Drinfeld double

∗ from a Lie bracket on g. To compute the bracket between g and g

Let us ﬁrst spell out what the Drinfeld double construction gives us for the case of the Lie algebra
of vector ﬁelds. As we recall from the previous section, the Drinfeld double construction gives a Lie
∗ we note that
bracket on g ⊕ g
∗. Then
the last expression in (63) is equivalent to the following deﬁnition. Let a1, a2 ∈ g and b ∈ g
∗ is deﬁned so that h[a1, b], a2i = −hb, [a1, a2]i. Note that this is simply the requirement that
[a1, b] ∈ g
∗, it is easy to see that
the metric is invariant. With this way of deﬁning the bracket between g and g
we get the following expression for the Drinfeld double bracket between vector ﬁelds and one forms

[ξ, η] = Lξη + η(∂ξ),

ξ ∈ T M,

η ∈ T ∗M.

(85)

19

In momentum space terms we have

[ξ, η] = (ξ(k1 + k2))η + (ξη)k1.

We can also write the full bracket on the Drinfeld double

D = T M ⊕ T ∗M.

A general element of D is thus a sum of a vector ﬁeld and a one-form ξ + η. We have

[ξ1 + η1, ξ2 + η2] = [ξ1, ξ2] + Lξ1η2 − Lξ2η1 + η2(∂ξ1) − η1(∂ξ2),

(86)

(87)

(88)

where [ξ1, ξ2] is the usual Lie bracket of vector ﬁelds. We have explicitly checked that this bracket
satisﬁes Jacobi identity in the sense that

[[ξ1, ξ2], η] + [[ξ2, η], ξ1] + [[η, ξ1], ξ2] = 0.

(89)

The part of Jacobi identity with two or three instances of a one-form are trivially satisﬁed because
one-forms commute. We note that the Drinfeld double bracket (88) is similar to the so-called Courant
bracket put to prominent use in [15]. Both brackets are on the sum of the tangent and cotangent
bundles. The diﬀerence is in the last two terms, and in the fact that the Courant bracket does not
satisfy Jacobi identity.

6.2 The twist

The twist that we need to consider to get to the YM bracket is essentially the same as what is used
to encode the metric in Hitchin’s generalised geometry, see [16], page 3.

Thus, we twist the Drinfeld double in the sense of (71). That is, with every vector ﬁeld ξ ∈ T M
we associate an element of the Drinfeld double ξ + ξ∗, where ξ∗ ∈ T ∗M is the one-form obtained by
lowering the index of the vector ξ using the ﬂat metric. On elements of this form, the invariant metric
on the Drinfeld double is just (a multiple of) the ﬂat metric η.

The Drinfeld double bracket of two such elements is not longer an element of this form, but it can
be projected on such elements. This deﬁnes a new bracket on vector ﬁelds, which we shall refer to as
the YM bracket, as it coincides with (17), as we will now check. We have

([ξ1, ξ2]Y M ξ3) ≡ h[ξ1 + ξ∗

1, ξ2 + ξ∗
3i + h[ξ3, ξ1], ξ∗

2], (ξ3 + ξ∗
2i + h[ξ2, ξ3], ξ∗

3)i = h[ξ1, ξ2], ξ∗

1, ξ2], ξ3i
1i = ([ξ1, ξ2]ξ3) + ([ξ2, ξ3]ξ1) + ([ξ3, ξ1]ξ2),

2], ξ3i + h[ξ∗

3i + h[ξ1, ξ∗

= h[ξ1, ξ2], ξ∗

(90)

where we have used the invariance (23) of the Drinfeld double metric to get the ﬁrst expression in
the second line. Here h, i is the invariant metric on the Drinfeld double and (ξ1, ξ2) = ηµν ξµ
2 is the
metric pairing of vector ﬁelds. We recognise here the YM bracket as deﬁned via (15), (16).

1 ξν

6.3 The modiﬁed Jacobi

Thus, we have explained the YM bracket (17) as arising via the simple twist ξ → ξ + ξ∗ of the Drinfeld
double with the bracket (88). As we also know from considerations of the previous section, the failure
of the Jacobi for the YM bracket to be satisﬁed is explained by the fact that in [[ξ1, ξ2]Y M , ξ3]Y M we
project on the u part of the Drinfeld double D before computing the second bracket. The missing
terms contain the terms in the u

⊥ part.

Let us compute these terms. Thus, we consider

([ξ1 + ξ∗

1, ξ2 + ξ∗

2](ξ3 − ξ∗

3)) = −([ξ1, ξ2]ξ∗

3) + ([ξ3, ξ1]ξ∗

2) + ([ξ2, ξ3]ξ∗

1).

(91)

20

Writing all terms here in the momentum space we get

([ξ1 + ξ∗

1, ξ2 + ξ∗

2](ξ3 − ξ∗

3)) := ([ξ1, ξ2]⊥

Y M ξ3),

where

[ξ1, ξ2]⊥

Y M = (ξ1ξ2)(k1 − k2) + (ξ1k1)ξ2 − (ξ2k2)ξ1.

Let us now compute the terms contributing to the Jacobi identity. We have

Y M ) = ((k1 − k2)(k3 − k4))(ξ1ξ2)(ξ3ξ4)
+(ξ1ξ2)((k1 − k2)((ξ3k3)ξ4 − (ξ4k4)ξ3)) + (ξ3ξ4)((k3 − k4)((ξ1k1)ξ2 − (ξ2k2)ξ1))
+ (((ξ1k1)ξ2 − (ξ2k2)ξ1)((ξ3k3)ξ4 − (ξ4k4)ξ3)) .

Y M [ξ3, ξ4]⊥

([ξ1, ξ2]⊥

(92)

(93)

(94)

The ﬁrst of the terms on the right-hand-side is what appears in (44). All other terms are vanishing
on-shell. Collecting them requires some work, but the end result is

([ξ1, ξ2]⊥

Y M [ξ3, ξ4]⊥

Y M ) + ([ξ3, ξ1]⊥

Y M [ξ2, ξ4]⊥

Y M ) + ([ξ1, ξ4]⊥

Y M [ξ2, ξ3]⊥

Y M ) = −v4 + δ′v3,

(95)

where v4 is as in (44) and δ′v3 is given by (51).

We now take into account the fact that the Drinfeld double metric (74) on elements of the form
ξ − ξ∗ is negative deﬁnite. There is thus an extra minus sign in comparing the contributions from u
and u

⊥. Thus, we see that the Drinﬂed double Jacobi identity takes the form

([ξ1, ξ2]Y M [ξ3, ξ4]Y M ) + ([ξ3, ξ1]Y M [ξ2, ξ4]Y M ) + ([ξ1, ξ4]Y M [ξ2, ξ3]Y M )
Y M ),

Y M ) + ([ξ1, ξ4]⊥

Y M ) + ([ξ3, ξ1]⊥

Y M [ξ3, ξ4]⊥

Y M [ξ2, ξ4]⊥

Y M [ξ2, ξ3]⊥

= ([ξ1, ξ2]⊥

(96)

and that this coincides with (50). This completes the interpretation of (50) that we discovered by a
computation following from the YM Feynman rules, as the Jacobi identity in the Drinﬂed double of
the Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds.

6.4 Gauge-ﬁxing freedom as twist

Here we interpret the gauge-ﬁxing freedom (8) parametrised by an anti-symmetric tensor C µν as
another type of twist of the Drinfeld double. This is the twist by an anti-symmetric tensor, and is
thus of the type that was already considered in the previous section and that by itself does not take
one out of the setting of Lie bi-algebras. Here we combine this twist with the already considered twist
by a symmetric tensor. The full twist is a twist of the Drinfeld double and does not preserve the Lie
bi-algebra setting.

Thus, let us consider the tensor

which no longer has any speciﬁc symmetry property, as a sum of the symmetric metric and anti-
symmetric C. We can use this tensor to lower the indices of vector ﬁelds

Xµν := ηµν + Cµν,

(97)

X : T M → T ∗M,

ξµ → ξX

µ := ξνXνµ.

We can then consider elements of the Drinfeld double of the form

ξ + ξX .

The orthogonal complement in D to elements of this form are elements

ξ − ξX T

,

21

(98)

(99)

(100)

where X T is the transpose X T

µν = Xνµ.

Let us consider the Drinfeld double bracket of two elements of the form (99), projected again on

an element of this form. We have

h[ξ1 + ξX

= h[ξ1, ξ2], ξX

1 , ξ2 + ξX

2 ], ξ3 + ξX
3 i + h[ξ3, ξ1], ξX

3 i = h[ξ1, ξ2], ξX
2 i + h[ξ2, ξ3], ξX

3 i + h[ξ1, ξX
1 i = v3(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) + vC

2 ], ξ3i + h[ξX

1 , ξ2], ξ3i
3 (ξ1, ξ2, ξ3),

(101)

where vC
3 is given by (25). Thus, we see that the gauge-ﬁxing freedom (8) just corresponds to the
availability of more general twists (99), where the twisting tensor is a sum of a symmetric metric and
an anti-symmetric tensor C.

7 Five points

Here we apply the structure discovered at four points to the problem of constructing a colour-
kinematics dual expression for amplitudes at 5 points. The non-triviality of this requirement will
already be seen at this level, and generalisations to higher points, if at all possible, will follow the
pattern to be identiﬁed in this case.

7.1 Feynman diagrams at ﬁve points

To be as explicit as possible, we start by drawing all (groups of) Feynman diagrams that can arise at
5 points. As in the case of four points considered above, we would like to read diagrams as maps from
a set of gluons to the ﬁnal gluon state. We take the gluon number 5 to represent the ﬁnal state. The
topology of 3-valent diagrams is such that the gluon number 5 sits either at the end of a diagram, or
in the middle, see pictures below.

Let us ﬁrst draw diagrams where gluon 5 is at the end. This can always be drawn as being at the

bottom of the diagram. We get 4 groups of 3 diagrams, each group consisting of diagrams like

plus 3×3 more diagrams like this, with gluon 4 in the bottom right being replaced by 1, 2, 3 respectively.

Then, there are 3 diagrams where the gluon 5 is in the middle of the diagram

7.2 Numerators

As is well-known, see e.g. [17], there are 15 diﬀerent numerators at 5 points. Each of these numerators
corresponds to one of the 3-valent diagrams (102), (103). Then can be labelled by specifying one
of the pairs at the sides of the diagram, together with the middle leg. Thus, e.g.
the numerator
corresponding to the ﬁrst diagram in (102) can be labelled as n3
12. We read the diagram from the top,
and so we have n3

45 = −n3

12.

Diagrams that are 3-valent correspond to a unique numerator. However, each numerator also
12 is given

receives a contribution from diagrams with 4-valent vertex. For example, the numerator n3
by

n3
12 = s12s45

(106)

Here sij = (ki + kj)2 is the (inverse of) the propagator. It is understood that each diagram is with the
colour structure constants stripped oﬀ. It is also understood that only part of the second and third
diagram with the colour contraction as in the ﬁrst diagram contribute. In the ﬁrst diagram the factor
s12s45 removes the propagators, while in the second and third diagrams one propagator (for the single
intermediate line) is removed in each, and a factor of s is introduced.

23

7.3

Identities at 4 points

To help understand the situation at 5 points, let us introduce a graphical representation of the identities
we discovered at 4 point. Thus, we have seen that the colour- and propagator- stripped 3-valent
Feynman graph have the interpretation of a successive application of the YM bracket. We continue
to denote this bracket by a cubic vertex sourced by straight lines. Thus, we have

s12

≡ ([ξ1, ξ2]Y M [ξ3, ξ4]Y M ).

(107)

Here on the left we have a colour-stripped Feynman graph, which is also multiplied by s12 to remove
the propagator. On the right we have a quantity that has the Drinfeld double interpretation, as
explained in the previous section.

We have also seen in (44) that the sum of colour-stripped contributions from the 4-valent vertex,
with missing propagators introduced can be seen as a sum over 3-valent graphs, modulo terms that
vanish on transverse vector ﬁelds

we have the following important failure of two quantities to be equal

(110)

Here e.t. stands for ”exact terms”. This failure of an equality to hold is the principal reason why we
cannot produce explicit colour-kinematics satisfying numerators beyond 4 points.

24

7.4 Sum of numerators at 5 points

We now check what the above identities at 4 points imply for the sum of numerators at 5 points. The
colour-kinematics satisfying numerators at 4 points should satisfy 3-term identities. For instance, one
12 + n1
must have n3
31 = 0. Let us compute this sum using the graphical representation of all the
quantities. We have

Unfortunately, we cannot perform a similar operation on the sum of the last term in each line in (111).
In all these terms, after the intermediate line propagator is removed, what is left is the same kinematic
factor s45 in front.

Even in the absence of the equality sign in (110) we can further simplify things by noting that the
sum of (112) and (113) vanishes by the already established property at 4 points. Indeed, since in this
⊥ that the intermediate top line can be projected, this sum equals to
sum we sum over both ways u, u
the sum of 3 Lie algebra diagrams with no projection on the top line. Thus, this is just the Jacobiator
of 3 vector ﬁelds ξ1 + ξ∗

projector on u inserted

[ξ1, ξ2, ξ3] := [[ξ1, ξ2], ξ3] + [[ξ2, ξ3], ξ1] + [[ξ3, ξ1], ξ2].

(114)

(115)

Thus, we see that the sum of the kinematic numerators in (111) equals to just the sum of the
last terms in each line. Each of these terms is proportional to s45, and so the sum of the kinematics
numerators n3
31 is also proportional to s45. This is all we can conclude from the Feynman
rules, as well as using the Jacobi identity established at 4 points.

We have thus conﬁrmed that the kinematic numerators nk
ij produced by the Feynman rules do not
satisfy the colour-kinematic duality, which is a known fact. However, our Lie-algebraic interpretation
suggests the following way to correct this.

Thus, let us assume that there is some other way of writing the Feynman rules (and perhaps some
other twist of the Drinfeld double) in which there is an equal sign in (110). We make some remarks
on how this could be possible in the last section. We could then use this property individually for the

26

last terms in each line in (111). Then the sum of these terms would be

The ”exact terms” here correspond to terms where a purely longitudinal vector ﬁeld appears on an
undotted line of a diagram. When physical transverse vector ﬁelds are inserted into the external lines
all such terms vanish, so they can be ignored for purposes of understanding of the colour-kinematics
duality.

Now comes the crucial point in our (potential) interpretation of the colour-kinematics. It is clear
that what appears on the right-hand-side of (117) fails short of giving zero because terms where both
intermediate lines are projected onto the u

⊥ are absent. Indeed, we can write

This is because the sum of all the terms on the right-hand-side here is (modulo exact terms) just the

The individual terms in (118) are various projections of this quantity on u, u
double on the intermediate lines. Summing over all possible projections is equivalent to removing the
projections, and so (118) follows from the usual Jacobi identity in the doubled space D = u ⊕ u

⊥.

Now, the last 3 terms in the right-hand-side of (118) that are needed for the colour-kinematics
duality to hold are not generated by the usual Feynman rules, even with our assumption that a
representation giving equality sign in (110) is possible. However, it is clear how to correct for this.
Indeed, one just has to add to the YM Lagrangian a new 5-valent interaction term that generates
the terms in (118). With these terms added, the equality in (118) would be the statement of colour-
kinematics. To put it diﬀerently, the colour-kinematic dual set of numerators ckn would be given
by

Here n are the numerators produced by the Feynman rules and the term represented by a picture
in the ﬁrst line is what is missing for the colour-kinematics duality to hold. Thus, we are led to the
colour-kinematic dual numerators that are given by simple successive application of the bracket in the
Drinfeld double.

This suggestion of how the kinematic factors satisfying the duality could be obtained is conﬁrmed
by the ﬁndings in [18], where the authors observe that in order to obtain the colour-kinematic dual
numerators at 5 points, one has to add to the YM Lagrangian certain non-local term, which is a total
divergence not aﬀecting the amplitudes. We propose that the term in (120) that is needed to give the
colour-kinematic dual numerators can similarly be interpreted as coming from a new 5-valent vertex
that is to be added to the Lagrangian without aﬀecting the amplitudes.

7.6 The reality

We, however, should face the reality in which, at least for the structures described in this paper, there
is no equality sign in (110). Thus, what is described in the previous subsection is only a possibility
for how the colour-kinematics could work, and for how the colour-kinematic dual numerators could
be obtained. Without having the equal sign in (110) we cannot translate the terms in the ﬁrst line of
(116) into objects having Lie algebraic interpretation. The only thing we can say about this sum is
that it is proportional to s45. Hence, the failure of the kinematic numerators in (111) to add up to
zero is a multiple of s45. It is then possible to see how the equations for the generalised Jacobi-like
identities (3.24)-(3.27) of [17] can be satisﬁed. Indeed, each X factor in these formulas is divided by
the Mandelstam variable that we have seen this factor is proportional to.

8 Discussion

Let us start by summarising what has been achieved. We have extracted from the YM Feynman rules
what we called the YM bracket, which is an anti-symmetric operation that sends a pair of vector ﬁelds
into a vector ﬁeld. This YM bracket is closely linked to the Jacobi bracket, but does not coincide with

28

it. We then saw that the Jacobiator of the YM bracket is cancelled by the contributions from the YM
quartic vertex, apart from on-shell vanishing terms. Thus, YM Feynman rules lead to a version of the
Jacobi identity at 4 points.

We then interpreted this identity as the Jacobi identity of the Drinfeld double. The Drinfeld double
is a construction that associates any Lie algebra a certain Lie algebraic structure on the sum of the
Lie algebra and its dual. Having a metric in our disposal, we can associate any vector ﬁeld its dual
one-form. We can then twist the Drinfeld double of vector ﬁelds by considering elements of the form
ξ + ξ∗. We then saw that the YM bracket is simply the projection of the bracket on the Drinfeld
double on elements of this form. The failure of the Jacobi identity to be satisﬁed is then a simple
consequence of the fact that elements of this form do not form a Lie sub-algebra. We also saw that
the Jacobi-like identity that we discovered from the YM Feynman rules is the Jacobi identity of the
Drinfeld double.

The resulting Lie-algebraic interpretation suggests how the colour-kinematics duality can work at
higher points. Thus, we were led to a very simple expression (120) for the would-be colour-kinematic
dual numerators. These should be given simply by a successive application of the Dinfeld double
bracket.

The story that we presented is only a partial success because, as we saw, to be able to convert
the numerators following from Feynman rules into quantities having Lie-algebraic interpretation we
need an equality sign in (110). Thus, we need to ﬁnd a version of the Feynman rules where individual
contributions from the 4-valent vertex are representable as coming from a product of two cubic vertices.
This is a non-trivial requirement, as is clear from inspection of these contributions.
Indeed, these
contributions are of the form

(k1 + k2)2((ξ1ξ3)(ξ2ξ4) − (ξ2ξ3)(ξ1ξ4)).

(121)

They are clearly not representable as a product of two structures coming from some cubic vertices.
Indeed, each such cubic vertex should be linear in momenta. Then, in order for the result to contain
the momentum squared, the cubic vertex on vector ﬁelds ξ1, ξ2 must be of the form k(ξ1ξ2) for some
momentum k. But in order for this to be anti-symmetric this must be (k1 − k2)(ξ1ξ2). And indeed,
we saw in (44) that the sum of contributions of the form (121) can be rewritten as the sum of squares
of quantities like (k1 − k2)(ξ1ξ2). But does not hold for individual contributions, and this is why there
is no equality sign in (110).

Before we discuss possible ways to go around this obstacle, let us further comment on our suggested
expression for the kinematic numerators (120). First, these are well-deﬁned expressions that can be
computed using the bracket in the Drinfeld double. Second, by construction they satisfy the Jacobi
identities and in this sense are colour-kinematic dual. However, if one attempts to use them to
construct the amplitudes one will not obtain those of YM theory. This is because in the construction
of the amplitudes one will be dividing the numerators by the propagators, and this produces incorrect
expressions for the parts that are graphically represented by diagrams with dots on intermediate lines.
This is because these diagrams will contain factors of the form (k1−k3)(k2−k4) = s12−s23. This is to be
divided by s13 when forming the amplitude. The denominator then does not cancel the numerator, and
this produces wrong expressions for the amplitudes. In particular, the amplitude produced according
to these rules at 4 points fails to be gauge invariant, because of the wrong contribution from the
4-valent vertex diagram.

As far as we are aware, there is no way around this obstacle in representing (121) as a square
unless one introduces some extra structure. One known to us way to obtain such a representation is
speciﬁc to four space-time dimensions, and requires the introduction of the ǫµνρσ tensor into the game.
Indeed, let us introduce the following bracket

[ξ1, ξ2]∗

µ := (ηµρηνσ − ηµσηνρ + ǫµνρσ)(k1 + k2)νξρ

1 ξσ
2 .

(122)

29

Here we assumed that the signature of the metric is Euclidean. Note that this is an anti-symmetric
operation on vector ﬁelds and in this sense can correspond to a ”bracket”. A computation gives

− ([ξ1, ξ2]∗[ξ3, ξ4]∗) = (k1 + k2)2((ξ1ξ3)(ξ2ξ4) − (ξ2ξ3)(ξ1ξ4) + (ǫξ1ξ2ξ3ξ4)).

(123)

Here (ǫξ1ξ2ξ3ξ4) := ǫµνρσξµ
4 . Apart from the last term that contracts all vector ﬁelds into the
ǫ tensor, this coincides with (121). It remains to be seen if this can be completed to some Drinfeld
double type structure with a bracket satisfying the Jacobi identity.

2 ξρ

1 ξν

3 ξσ

µν F a

The above computation suggests that it may be possible to achieve a diﬀerent representation of the
Feynman rules in which there would be an equality sign in (110) by adding an appropriate multiple of
ǫµνρσF a
ρσ into the action. Being a total derivative this would not change the amplitudes, but adds
precisely the quantity (ǫξ1ξ2ξ3ξ4) to the (colour stripped) quartic vertex. Thus, adding such a term
has a potential to make the story outlined in the main body of the paper work. We leave exploration
of this possibility, which is speciﬁc to four dimensions, to future work.

We ﬁnish by pointing out that there are similarities between the double structure that arose in this
work, and the structures one encounters in the double ﬁeld theory [19], [20]. The later also mixes the
metric and the anti-symmetric tensor similar to (97), as well as considers objects of the type ξ + ξ∗.
The structure of the double ﬁeld theory is governed by a D+D dimensional metric of signature (D, D),
as is the case also here. The main diﬀerence lies in the fact that the Courant bracket that is used
in double ﬁeld theory does not satisfy the Jacobi identity, unlike the bracket in the Drinfeld double
case. However, the Courant bracket satisﬁes Jacobi modulo exact terms, which can be suﬃcient for
the purposes of explaining the on-shell colour-kinematics duality. At the moment of writing we do not
know whether the structure encountered in double ﬁeld theory with its C-bracket has anything to do
with the colour-kinematics duality of YM theory, but the similarity with the structures that arose in
this paper are striking.
