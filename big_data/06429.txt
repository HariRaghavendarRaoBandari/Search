Dense compact objects like neutron stars or black holes have always been
one of Gerry Brown’s favorite research topics. This is closely related
to the eﬀects of strangeness in nuclear physics. Here, we review the
chiral Eﬀective Field Theory approach to interactions involving nucleons
and hyperons, the possible existence of strange dibaryons, the fate of
hyperons in nuclear matter and the present status of three-body forces
involving hyperons and nucleons.

1. Introduction

Gerry Brown was a fascinating scholar and human being with a broad
range of physics interests. One of his prime foci was the physics of dense
and compact objects like neutron stars and black holes, see e.g. Refs.1–8
With the observation of two solar mass neutron stars, this physics has taken
a new twist, commonly referred to as the “hyperon puzzle”. This puzzle
relates to the fact that the equation of state in the presence of hyperons
is generally too soft to allow for such heavy neutron stars. Some repulsive
mechanism, may it be related to the hyperon-nucleon or hyperon-hyperon
interactions, or even to more exotic three-body forces involving hyperons,
is thus required to reconcile the presence of hyperons within such dense
and compact objects with their global properties, see e.g. Refs.9,10 (and

references therein). This is were some of our recent research comes in,
namely the chiral Eﬀective Field Theory (EFT) based description of the
hyperon-nucleon (Y N ) in Sec. 2 and the hyperon-hyperon (Y Y ) interac-
tions in Sec. 3. Another related fascinating topic is the possible existence
of exotic states with baryon number two, formed from two hyperons, which
we will also discuss in Sec. 4. Next, we discuss the behavior of hyperons in
nuclear matter in Sec. 5. Last but not least, we consider the ﬁnal frontier,
namely the three-body forces involving hyperons in Sec. 6. We are quite
certain that Gerry would have loved these developments and we therefore
dedicate this paper to his memory.

2. Hyperon-nucleon interactions

The basic ingredient in hyper-nuclear physics is the hyperon-nucleon inter-
action. Conventionally, it has been studied based on meson-exchange mod-
els, however, with the advent of successfull EFT methods for the nucleon-
nucleon (N N ) interaction (see Refs.11,12 for reviews), one now has a bet-
ter and more systematic handle on these fundamental interactions, ﬁrmly
rooted in the symmetries of QCD. In contrast to the N N interaction, the
amount of data on Y N (Y = Λ, Σ) scattering is scarce, about 35 data points
supplemented by the binding energies of a few light hyper-nuclei. Therefore,
any EFT description of these data has a more exploratory character than it
is the case for the N N problem. In fact, the ﬁrst work on the Y N interac-
tion in EFT was due to Korpa et al.,13 who made use of the so-called KSW
power counting.14 In the Bonn-J¨ulich group, we already had made good
experiences with the so-called Weinberg power counting for the N N interac-
tions. In that scheme, chiral perturbation theory is utilized for calculating
the potential between two or more baryons in a systematic manner. This
potential is then used within a regularized Lippmann-Schwinger (LS) equa-
tion to generate the bound and the scattering states, T = V + V G0T , with
T the T-matrix and G0 the two-baryon propagator. The leading order (LO)
Y N → Y N calculations were performed by Polinder and the authors15 and
later, the next-to-leading order (NLO) contributions were analyzed in col-
laboration with the Munich group of Norbert Kaiser, Stephan Petschauer
and Wolfram Weise.16 For a comparison of the EFT and more conventional
approaches, see Ref.17 In what follows, we eschew models.

The EFT is constructed from the asymptotically observed particles, the
hadrons, here from the baryon octet (for short, baryons) and the Goldstone-
boson octet (for short, mesons). The basic ingredient in the EFT approach

square symbolizes a contact vertex with two derivatives. From left to right: LO contact

contributes to the potential.

to the Y N interaction is the eﬀective potential, with its various terms or-
dered according to the power counting. At leading order, O(Q0), where Q
denotes an external momentum or a Goldstone boson mass, there are two
types of contributions. First, one has one-meson-exchange graphs, with
all couplings constants expressed in terms of the pion-nucleon coupling
gπN N and the ratio of the SU(3) axial-couplings F/(F + D). Second, based
on group theory arguments, there are six four-baryon contact terms with-
out derivatives. From those, only ﬁve contribute to the scattering process
Y N → Y N while all six occur in the Y Y sector. Extending to NLO, one
has now also contributions from two-meson-exchange diagrams and further
contact interactions with two derivatives. The pertinent Feynamn diagrams
are depicted in Fig. 1. All these have been calculated and included in the
potential presented in Ref.16 However, it should be stressed that some two-
meson-exchanges like K ¯K or ηK are so short-ranged that they could be
also eﬀectively absorbed in the contact terms. The number of additional
contact interactions is large, so in general we resort to account only for
SU(3) symmetric terms and ﬁt only the low-energy constants (LECs) re-
lated to the S-wave terms and use P -wave N N phase shifts as constraints.
However, physical masses of the mesons and the baryons are used through-
out. This is needed to account properly for the fact that the pion mass is
much smaller than that of the other Goldstone bosons and also to have the
correct threshold energies for the various baryon-baryon channels, and it
introduces a certain amount of SU(3) breaking.

In Fig. 2, we show some assorted results for the reactions Λp → Λp and
Σ−p → Λn. The middle panel zooms on the region around the Σ+n and
the Σ0p thresholds for Λp scattering. In both cases, the bands at the given
order are obtained by variations of the cut-oﬀ in the LS equation, that is
applied in terms of the regulator function fR(Λ) = exp[−(p′4 + p4)/Λ4],
with Λ the cut-oﬀ. This is only a very rough estimate of the theoretical

e.g. in Refs.18,19 However, we remark that the NLO contributions improve
the description of the data and that the uncertainty bands shrink with
increasing order.

3. Strangeness S = −2, −3, −4 baryon-baryon interactions

The experimental situation in the sector with strangeness S = −2 (Y Y
and ΞN interactions), with S = −3 (ΞY interactions) and S = −4 (ΞΞ in-
teractions) is even poorer than for the hyperon-nucleon interaction. There
are some constraints on the ΛΛ interaction from double-Λ hyper-nuclei and
from ﬁnal-state interactions in production reactions. Similarly, there are
bounds on the Ξ−p elastic cross section and for Ξ−p → ΛΛ in a broad
momentum range. There are some further results on in-medium cross sec-
tions and a few constraints from production experiments. For a detailed
discussion, we refer the reader to Ref.20

It is therefore interesting to perform exploratory studies of the baryon-
baryon interaction with S = −2 and with S = −3, −4 at LO, see Refs.21,22
As already noted, at LO one has one more contact interaction in the S = −2
system compared to S = −1. Denoting the corresponding LEC by C1 and
varying its value within the natural range, given by23 |C1| = 4π/F 2
π , with
Fπ the pion decay constant, one observes that the chiral EFT predictions
are consistent with the experimental information on the S = −2 sector.

from the Σ+p cross section.

Using the LECs ﬁxed in the ﬁt to the ΛN and ΣN data, one can make
predictions for the ΞΛ, ΞΣ and ΞΞ interactions. Strong attraction is found
in some of the S = −3 and S = −4 channels, suggesting the possible
existence of bound states. However, as we will argue below, these seem to
be artefacts of the SU(3) symmetry imposed on the contact interactions.

N N = C χ

In the approximation of taking only the SU(3) symmetric contact inter-
actions, a consistent description of the N N and Y N data is not possible.
However, at NLO SU(3) breaking contact terms arise in the employed Wein-
berg power counting scheme.24 These allow one to account for the leading
SU(3) breaking terms in the 1S0 wave for the baryon-baryon channels with
maximal isospin, that contributes e.g. to nucleon-nucleon scattering via the
π)/2, see Ref.25 From a simultaneous de-
potential V I=1
scription of the pp and the Σ+p phase shifts one can pin down the LEC C χ
1
and then predict the ΣΣ interaction, see Fig. 3. In the left panel of Fig. 4
we show the LO and NLO results for Ξ−p → ΛΛ in comparison to the data
from Ahn et al.27 and Kim et al.28 Both are consistent with these data.
Note that the LO results are solely determined by the underlying SU(3)
symmetry whereas in the NLO case the aforementioned SU(3) symmetry
breaking in the 1S0 wave is taken into account. The results for Ξ−p → Ξ−p
shown in the right panel of Fig. 4 indicate that some degree of SU(3) sym-
metry breaking is also required in the 3S1 partial wave. Speciﬁcally, we
see that the inclusion of the leading SU(3) symmetry breaking term con-
siderably lowers the prediction, giving a better agreement with the upper

bound from Ref.27 (red/dark band). Relying strictly on SU(3) symmetry
would yield cross sections that are apparently too large, cf. the hatched
band. A more detailed account of these topics, including also discussions
of the pertinent baryon-baryon scattering lengths and eﬀective ranges can
be found in Ref.20 It is fairly obvious that to make further progress in this
ﬁeld, one needs more data, that are expected to come from the J-PARC
facility in Japan and from FAIR at Darmstadt (Germany).

a calculation where all LECs are taken over from the Y N ﬁt. The data can be traced
back from Ref.20

4. Exotic bound states?

Another fascinating topic related to the baryon-baryon interactions is the
possible appearance of (exotic) bound states. Historically, the so-called
dibaryons have been conceived either as tightly bound six quark objects or
as shallow bound states of two baryons. For the ﬁrst category, the recently
observed dibaryon d∗(2380) at COSY (Forschungszentrum J¨ulich)29,30 qual-
iﬁes, whereas an established loosely bound state of a proton and the neu-
tron, the deuteron, is one of the best studied nuclei. The deuteron is a
bound state in the 3S1-3D1 channel, whereas the binding of the proton-
neutron system in the 1S0 channel is just not strong enough to produce a
bound state and only a virtual state is created. May be the most famous,
– or should we say: infamous? – dibaryon is the H-particle predicted by
Jaﬀe within the bag model as a compact |uuddssi state.31 After decades
of failed experiments to establish its presence, it regained popularity a few

years ago from lattice sightings reported in Refs.,32,33 though at unphys-
ical quark masses. The quantum numbers of the H are these of the ΛΛ
system in an S-wave state, namely strangeness S = −2, isospin I = 0, and
J P = 0+. Other predicted dibaryons involving strangeness are cousins of
the d∗(2380)34 or generated from the attractive interaction between certain
baryons, e.g. in the ΞΞ but also for the ΞΣ and ΞΛ systems.22,35 Note that
the NPLQCD Collaboration reported evidence for a Ξ−Ξ− bound state.36
This list is by far not exhaustive but should merely serve as an illustration
that there might be very rich physics in systems involving strangeness -
strange exotics.

The chiral EFT discussed so far is very well suited to shed light on the
H-dibaryon, should it indeed exist. In particular, one can study the impli-
cations of the imposed (approximate) SU(3) symmetry and further explore
the dependence of its properties on the involved meson and baryon masses.
The latter aspect is important as the existing lattice QCD calculations were
not performed at the physical quark and thus hadron masses. In particular,
one can use the ﬂavor singlet LEC C1 as a dial to generate a bound state
with a given binding energy.37,38

The ﬁrst issue to be discussed in this context is the eﬀective range ex-
pansion in the 1S0 channel of the ΛΛ interaction. Let us assume that the
H is a loosely bound two-baryon state much like the deuteron. For illustra-
tion, let us ﬁx the value of the LEC C1 such that the binding momentum
of the H is the same as for the deuteron, γ = 45.7 MeV, related to the
binding energy via E = −γ2/mB, with mB either mN or mΛ. As it is
well-known, the eﬀective range expansion of Bethe and Schwinger relates
the binding momentum to the scattering length a and eﬀective range r,
1/a ≃ γ − rγ2/2. While this is very well fulﬁlled for the deuteron, the
corresponding results for the ΛΛ-system in the 1S0 wave are very diﬀer-
ent, a ≃ −0.65 fm and r ≃ 6 fm.20 Thus, the properties of the H are very
diﬀerent from the ones of the deuteron, despite the fact that both are close-
to-threshold bound states. This can also be understood from the eﬀective
potentials in the I = 0 channel, the SU(3) ﬂavor singlet ∼ C1 contributes
with a much larger strength to ΞN than to ΛΛ. This means that the H
should predominantly be a ΞN bound state. This can be sharpened by
looking at the corresponding phase shifts, the one in the ΞN channel is
rather similar to the N N 3S1 phase shift, see Refs.,37,38 see also Fig. 5.

Second, one can use the chiral EFT to vary the quark/pion mass to make
contact to the lattice QCD results. If one sticks to the SU(3) symmetric
case, one ﬁnds that for pion masses below 400 MeV, the dependence of

Fig. 5. Phase shifts for ΛΛ (1S0) (left) and ΞN (1S0) (right) as a function of the per-
tinent laboratory energies. The solid line is the result for our reference BB interaction
that produces a bound H at EH = −1.87 MeV. The other curves are results for interac-
tions that are ﬁne-tuned to the H binding energies found in the lattice QCD calculations
of the HAL QCD (dashed) and NPLQCD (dash-dotted) collaborations, respectively, for
the pertinent meson (pion) and baryon masses as given by the lattice collaborations.

the binding energy of the H on Mπ is linear, see also Ref.39 In particular,
if one adjusts the H binding energy to the value found by the NPLQCD
collaboration at Mπ = 389 MeV, it is reduced by 7 MeV when going to the
physical point. For larger pion masses, this dependence is weakened but
one should be aware that the EFT can not be trusted anymore at too large
pion masses.

A third, and much more drastic eﬀect, is caused by the SU(3) breaking
related to the three thresholds for ΛΛ, ΣΣ and ΞN , which are located at
2231.2, 2257.7, and 2385.0 MeV, in order. For physical values, the binding
energy of the H is reduced by as much as 60 MeV as compared to an
SU(3) symmetric interaction with degenerate two-baryon thresholds. For
the lattice QCD results of the HAL QCD collaboration, this means that
the bound state has disappeared at the physical point where as for the
NPLQCD case, a resonance in the ΛΛ system might survive, cf. also Fig. 5.
The intricacies of coupled channel systems at unphysical quark masses are
further discussed in the appendix.

As noted above, there have been speculations about bound states in
two-baryon systems with S = −3 and S = −4, as e.g. given by the LO
and NLO SU(3) symmetric interactions in our EFT. However, we have
rexamined the role of SU(3) breaking in Ref.25 As worked out by Kaiser
and Petschauer,24 there are 12 leading order symmetry breaking terms
with corresponding LECs, from which 6 appear in the 1S0 and 6 in the
3S1 partial wave. At present, there is simply not enough information to
determine these all. However, if we restrict ourselves to the BB systems

2 . We had already discussed in Sec. 3 how to ﬁx C χ

in the 1S0 wave with maximal isospin, only two such LECs survive, called
C χ
1 . The
other LEC can not be pinned down reliably at present, but must be varied
within a reasonable range. Including the symmetry breaking ∼ C χ
1 in the
ΣΣ channel, the scattering length and the corresponding attraction is much
reduced so that practically any bound state in this system can be ruled out.
It is reasonable to assume that C χ
1 and that the
increase in repulsion when going from N N to ΣN to ΣΣ is not reversed
for the S = −3 and S = −4 systems. In that case, bound states in these
systems are also rather unlikey. For a more detailed discussion, we refer
the reader to Ref.25

5. Hyperons in nuclear matter

Apart from the quest to ﬁnd repulsion in the Y N interaction, there are other
interesting aspects of the behavior of hyperons in nuclei or nuclear matter.
In particular, the repulsive nature of the Σ-nucleus potential40 and the weak
Λ-nucleus spin-orbit interaction41–43 are long-standing issues, on which our
calculations of hyperons in nuclear matter have shed some light.44,45

First, we consider the antisymmetric spin-orbit force. It is generated
from the NLO potential V ∼ (~σ1 − ~σ2) · (~q × ~k), in terms of the Pauli
spin matrices, the exchange momentum ~q and the total momentum ~k. This
term gives rise to (spin) singlet-triplet (1P1-3P1) transitions. In our study
of the Y N interaction in free space16 this antisymmetric spin-orbit force
was set to zero because it can not be determined from Y N scattering data.
Matters are diﬀerent in nuclei. Here, the strength of the spin-orbit inter-
action is frequently parameterized in terms of the so-called Scheerbaum
factor SY ,46 which is related to the hyper-nuclear spin-orbit potential via
Y (r) = −(π/2)SY (1/r)(dρ(r)/dr)~ℓ · ~σ, with ρ(r) the nucleon density dis-
U ℓs
tribution and ~ℓ the single-particle orbital angular momentum operator. The
EFT approach allows us to tune the LEC related to the 1P1-3P1 transition
to achieve a value of44 SΛ = −3.7 MeV fm5, in accordance with phenomeno-
logical determinations that give SΛ in the range −4.6 to −3.0 MeV fm5.47,48
The standard method to calculate the properties of hyperons in a nu-
clear medium is Brueckner theory. The Brueckner reaction matrix (G-
matrix) is determined from a solution of the Bethe-Goldstone equation,
G(ω) = V + V [Q/(e(ω) + iǫ)]G(ω), with V the pertinent free-space poten-
tial, e(ω) the energy denominator depending on the starting energy ω, and
Q is the (angle-averaged) Pauli operator. Medium eﬀects are thus generated

from the Pauli operator as well as the density-dependent single-particle po-
tential U (ω) in the energy denominator e(ω). This single-particle potential
is obtained self-consistently from the G-matrix. There are two commonly
used methods to calculate the G-matrix. In the so-called gap choice, only
the free particle energies of the intermediate states appear in the energy
denominator of the Bethe-Goldstone equation. This method was e.g. used
in Ref.44 In the so-called continuous choice, the dependence of the energy
denominator on the full single-particle energies is retained. This method
is computationally more diﬃcult but allows to reliably access the imagi-
nary parts of the single-particle potentials, which is not possible when the
gap choice is employed. The results presented in Ref.45 are based on the
continuous choice.

In Fig. 6, we show the momentum dependence of the real and the imag-
inary part of the Λ single-particle potential in isospin-symmetric nuclear
matter. The bands refer to the usual cut-oﬀ variations, using the contin-
uous choice. We ﬁnd UΛ(k = 0) = −28 . . . − 24 MeV, consistent with the
empirical value of about −28 MeV as deduced from binding energies of Λ
hyper-nuclei.49,50 The corresponding results for the neutral Σ in isospin-
symmetric matter at saturation density are shown in Fig. 7, with small
diﬀerences for the charged Σ hyperons given by the small inter-multiplet
mass splittings. In pure neutron matter, matters are very diﬀerent. Due to
the maximal asymmetry between protons and neutrons, the single-particle
potentials for the Σ+, Σ0, Σ− hyperons are rather diﬀerent. These are dis-
cussed in detail in Ref.45 As already said above, the resulting Λ-nuclear
spin-orbit potential is small, which is partly due to cancellations between
contributions from the symmetric and the anti-symmetric spin orbit forces,

and partly due to the repulsive interactions in some of the P -waves. The
corresponding Scheerbaum factors for the Σ hyperons are much bigger than
for the Λ. Speciﬁcally, for the neutral Σ we ﬁnd SΣ = −15 . . .− 18 MeV fm5
at NLO. For more details, especially also a comparison between the re-
sults obtained in the gap and the continuous choice, see Refs.44,45 Note
that the in-medium hyperon spin-orbit interaction was also investigated in
Refs.47,51,52

6. Three-baryon interactions

The need for (repulsive) three-baryon forces was already alluded to in the
introduction. Another indication that points towards the necessity of such
forces are the calculations of the binding energies of light hyper-nuclei at
NLO by Nogga.53 Here, the remaining cut-oﬀ dependence hints at missing
three-body forces. More generally, it is well established that three-body
forces are required in nuclei and nuclear matter, see e.g. Refs.54,55

In the Weinberg power counting, three-baryon forces (3BFs) appear at
next-to-next-to-leading order and are given in terms of the three topologies
shown in Fig. 8. The ﬁrst and second topology require the meson-baryon
Lagrangian at NLO. Its minimal form is given in Ref.56 (see also Refs.57,58).
The six-baryon contact terms given by the topology (3) require the gen-
eral SU(3) Lagrangian that was constructed by Kaiser and Petschauer.24
Armed with these ingredients, the leading three-baryon forces were derived
in Ref.59 within SU(3) chiral EFT. For that, the chiral Lagrangian in the
non-relativistic limit with the minimal number of terms in the full SU(3)

sector was derived. One ﬁnds that there are in total 18 diﬀerent structures
corresponding to topology (3) accompanied by 18 LECs. However, only
a limited number of combinations of these LECs are involved in a given
process. In general, one can write this local contribution to the 3BFs as

in terms of the spin matrices of the three baryons and the Ni are prefac-
tors containing LECs and kinematical factors, and we have suppressed the
corresponding isospin factors, as detailed in Ref.59 It can be shown that
in the SU(2) limit one recovers the purely nucleonic contact term that is
accompanied by the LEC E.60 The graphs corresponding to the one-meson
exchange topology (2) require the knowledge of combinations of the 14 four-
baryon-one-meson vertices listed in Ref.24 In spin-momentum space, this
translates into the following structures:

mined from single pion production.61 Finally, the diagrams corresponding
to topology (1) are the generalizations of the well-known Fujita-Miyazawa
three-nucleon force, when the decuplet is considered as very heavy. The

in the same notations as before. Again, in the SU(2) limit this expression
recovers the well-known result in terms of the pion-nucleon LECs c1,3,4, cf.
e.g. Refs.60,62 The complete expressions for the much thought after ΛN N
three-body force can be found in Ref.59

At ﬁrst sight, the large number of LECs (or combinations thereof)
seems to be discomforting.
It certainly is not possible to ﬁx all these
from data at present. However, one can use decuplet saturation for es-
timating these LECs. This is based on the successful resonance saturation
hypothesis in the pion-nucleon sector63 that has already been utilized to
estimate nucleonic three-body forces in Refs.62,64,65 For that, consider the
theory with explicit decuplet degrees of freedom. Here, the three-body
forces appear already at NLO, and the pertinent diagrams are shown in
Fig. 9. These diagrams involve two kinds of vertices. First, there is the
leading meson-baryon-baryon vertex with an octet baryon and a decuplet
baryon (graphs (a) and (b)). The corresponding LEC C (sometimes also
called hA) can be estimated from the decay width ∆ → N π, and one
ﬁnds C = 3gA/4 ≃ 1, with gA the nucleon axial-vector coupling constant.
SU(3) symmetry can then be used to ﬁx the values for all other possible
combinations of octet and decuplet baryons. The other kind of vertices
are the ones with three octet baryons and one decuplet baryon (appear-
ing in graphs (b) and (c)). Those vertices involve two new constants. In
this case the pertinent constants can not be deduced from considering the
3N -∆ vertex simply because in leading order the latter is Pauli forbidden.
That there are exactly two such terms can be easily understood from group
theoretical considerations, for details see Ref.66 Let us call the correspond-
ing LECs G1 and G2 and consider the various topologies in detail and
their behaviour in the limit of inﬁnite decuplet masses, keeping the ratio

of coupling constants over decuplet mass ﬁxed. The graph (a) is nothing
but the dominant contribution to the famous Fujita-Miyazawa force. Its
emergence in chiral EFT is discussed in detail in Ref.67 In the heavy de-
cuplet limit, this type of graphs generates the topology (1) of Fig. 8, with
the LECs in the theory without decuplet given in very symbolic notation
by C 2φ ∼ α2φC 2/∆, where α2φ is some numerical factor and ∆ denotes
the decuplet-octet mass splitting. Similarly, the one-pion exchange topol-
ogy (2) in the theory without the decuplet is generated from the terms
of the type (b) in Fig. 9, leading to LECs with their strengths given by
C 1φ ∼ α1φC(G1 + β1φG2)/∆, again with α1φ and β1φ numerical factors.
Finally, the graphs of the type (c) lead to local six-baryon contact inter-
actions with their LECs given by C ct ∼ αct(G1 + βctG2)2/∆. Explicit
expressions for the ΛN N force can be found in Ref.66 Eventually, these
LECs might also be computed directly from lattice QCD, say along the
lines of Ref.68 We are looking forward to such calculations. To end this
section, we stress that it will be of utmost interest to work out the conse-
quences of these three-baryon forces within hyper-nuclei and compact dense
objects like neutron stars.

A.1. Coupled channel dynamics on the lattice: Intricacies

Here, we brieﬂy summarize the work of Ref.69
that nicely exhibits the
intricacies one faces when one is dealing with a coupled channel system
at unphysical quark masses in a ﬁnite volume. The starting point is the
observation, ﬁrst made by the Munich group,70 that the baryon resonance
S11(1535) can be generated through coupled channel dynamics in the πN ,
ηN , KΛ and KΣ systems with total isopin I = 1/2 in the odd-parity S11
partial wave of pion-nucleon scattering. Including also NLO terms in the
interaction kernel and using a ﬁeld theoretical regularization method, this
calculation was sharpened in Ref.,71 where it was shown that also the next

resonance, the S11(1650), is generated dynamically, see also Ref.72 for a
similar conclusion.

In Ref.69 we have considered two lattice set-ups that allow to investi-
gate the rich phenomenology in the odd-parity S11 partial wave for varying
quark masses. Set A is related to the work of the European Twisted Mass
collaboration (ETMC). In this set-up the meson masses and pion decay con-
stant are taken from the recent calculation in Nf = 2 + 1 + 1 twisted mass
lattice QCD, i.e. ensemble B25.32 of Ref.73 For the lattice size of L/a = 32
and spacing a = 0.078 fm, the pion mass is ﬁxed there to Mπ = 269 MeV,
whereas the strange quark mass is held approximately at the physical value.
As the kaon and eta decay constants are not available in this calculation
at the moment, we decided to relate them to Fπ with typical ratios of 1.15
and 1.3, respectively. The baryon masses are also taken from a calculation
by the ETMC, however, with only two dynamical quarks and an older lat-
tice action, see Ref.74 Nevertheless, the strange quark mass is held again
approximately at the physical value and Mπ = 269 MeV for the identical
lattice size and comparable lattice spacing, i.e. a = 0.0855 fm. The S11
amplitude, with the masses and decay constants of the ETMC, is shown in
the left upper panel of Fig. A.1. Comparing to the physical situation, all
thresholds have moved to higher energies. The cusp at the ηN threshold
has become more pronounced, but no clear resonance shapes are visible.
The structure of the amplitude becomes clearer by inspecting the complex
energy plane on diﬀerent Riemann sheets. This is visualized in the lower
left panels of Fig. A.1. Compared to the physical point, the imaginary parts
of the pole positions became much smaller due to the reduced phase space.
Both the thresholds and the real parts of the pole positions have moved to
higher energies. However, the thresholds have moved farther than the pole
positions, such that the N (1535) and N (1650) poles are no longer situated
below the part of the respective sheet, that is connected to the physical
axis (thick horizontal lines). The poles are thus hidden and no clear reso-
nance signals are visible in the physical amplitude. Instead, the amplitude
is dominated by cusp eﬀects.

Matters are very diﬀerent for set B, that refers to calculation from
QCDSF.75 Here, baryon and meson masses are determined from an al-
ternative approach to tune the quark masses, namely to start with the
SU(3) symmetry limit and work at a ﬁxed sum of the quark masses. Most
importantly, while the lattice size and spacing are comparable to those of
the ETMC, i.e. L/a = 32 and a = 0.075 fm, the strange quark mass diﬀers
signiﬁcantly from the physical value. The latter results in a diﬀerent order-

ing of the masses of the ground-state octet mesons and, consequently, in a
diﬀerent ordering of meson-baryon thresholds. For further details we refer
the interested reader to Ref.75 The amplitude using the QCDSF parameter
set is shown in the left upper panel of Fig. A.1. In contrast to the ETMC
case, a clear resonance signal is visible below the KΛ threshold, that is the
ﬁrst inelastic channel in this parameter setup. Indeed, we ﬁnd a pole N1 on
the corresponding Riemann sheet, as indicated in the right lower ﬁrst panel.
Unlike in the ETMC case, it is not hidden behind a threshold. Between the
KΛ and the KΣ threshold, there is only the hidden pole N2 (right lower
second panel). The KΣ and ηN thresholds are almost degenerate and on
sheets corresponding to these higher-lying thresholds we only ﬁnd hidden
poles.

This shows that the extraction of the scattering amplitude from lattice
QCD data is a major challenge as we demonstrate by extrapolating the
physical S11 amplitude of pion-nucleon scattering to the ﬁnite volume and
unphysical quark masses, using a unitarized chiral framework including all
next-to-leading order contact terms. As shown, the pole movement of the
resonances N (1535)1/2− and N (1650)1/2− with varying quark masses is
non-trivial. In addition, one can also calculate the ﬁnite volume energy lev-
els. One ﬁnds that there are several strongly coupled S-wave thresholds that
induce a similar avoided level crossing as narrow resonances. Consequently,

one has to be extremely careful in comparing lattice results at unphysical
quark masses when a strong coupled channel dynamics is present. For more
details, we refer the reader to Ref.69 Finally, we note that pion-nucleon
scattering in the negative parity channel in lattice QCD was considered by
Lang and Verduci.76
