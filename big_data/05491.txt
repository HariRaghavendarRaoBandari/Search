ABSTRACT

We examine the distribution of the [O/Fe] abundance ratio in stars across the Galactic disk using H-band spectra from the Apache Point
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We minimized systematic errors by considering groups of stars with similar atmospheric
parameters. The APOGEE measurements in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 reveal that the square root of the star-to-star
cosmic variance in oxygen at a given metallicity is about 0.03–0.04 dex in both the thin and thick disk. This is about twice as high
as the spread found for solar twins in the immediate solar neighborhood and is probably caused by the wider range of galactocentric
distances spanned by APOGEE stars. We quantiﬁed measurement uncertainties by examining the spread among stars with the same
parameters in clusters; these errors are a function of eﬀective temperature and metallicity, ranging between 0.005 dex at 4000 K and
solar metallicity, to about 0.03 dex at 4500 K and [Fe/H]≃ −0.6. We argue that measuring the spread in [O/Fe] and other abundance
ratios provides strong constraints for models of Galactic chemical evolution.

1. Introduction

Cosmic variance in the chemical composition of stars in a galaxy
is a natural outcome of the discrete character of the production
and return of nucleosynthetic yields from preceding generations
of stars to the interstellar medium (ISM). At a given location
within a galaxy, slower supernova (or star formation) rates and
higher variance in the yields from diﬀerent stars will contribute
to a higher cosmic variance in chemical abundances.

If two metals are produced in the same proportions in super-
novae, their abundance ratio in the ISM will remain constant. If
they are produced at diﬀerent sites or with diﬀerent proportions,
they can be used to constrain the chemical enrichment history of
a galaxy, even without any explicit reference to time or, equiv-
alently, to the ages of the stars being analyzed. This is the case,
for example, for oxygen and iron, with the former being mainly
produced in massive stars that die as Type II supernovae, and
the latter coming chieﬂy from Type Ia supernovae, the result of
the evolution of lower mass stars. If determined observationally,
the scatter in the abundance ratios of O/Fe at any given Fe can
provide valuable information on the star formation rate and nu-
cleosynthetic yields, complementing present-day abundance dis-
tributions in stars.

For years, eﬀorts to determine the spread in oxygen abun-
dances, or [O/Fe]1, at any given [Fe/H] have been unsuccessful.
Reddy et al. (2006) found a spread of about 0.07 dex for both
thin- and thick-disk members based on abundances from the O
I triplet at 777 nm that were calibrated to other lines to mini-
mize departures from local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE).
Ramírez et al. (2013), using again the O I triplet and including
detailed non-LTE calculations for their sample, found a spread
of about 0.05 dex among kinematically high-conﬁdence mem-
bers of the thin or thick disks. Most likely, in these and other
studies, the observational and analysis uncertainties were at the
same level as the observed spread in each population.

Recent progress in diﬀerential studies of solar analogs
has shown that a precision better than 0.01 dex is possible
(Meléndez et al. 2009; Ramírez et al. 2009; Beck et al. 2015).
Nissen (2015) examined the abundances of 14 elements in about
twenty nearby stars with atmospheric parameters very close to
solar (within 100 K in Teﬀ, about 0.1 dex in log g or [Fe/H]) and
found a scatter in [Ca/Fe] or [Cr/Fe] of about 0.01 dex for the
thin-disk members in his sample. In contrast, the scatter for other

elements is several times larger and in all cases clearly higher
than the measurement uncertainties. For the α-elements Mg, Si,
S, and Ti, Nissen found a tight correlation between their abun-
dance ratio to iron and stellar age, inferred from the comparison
with models of stellar structure and evolution, and thanks to the
extreme accuracy of the atmospheric parameters provided by the
diﬀerential analysis relative to the Sun.

These results have revealed the cosmic scatter in the abun-
dance ratios of thin-disk stars and provide new strong constraints
for chemical evolution models of the solar vicinity. Obviously,
it is desirable to extend these measurements beyond the solar
neighborhood, and in particular to carry out similar analyses for
thick-disk stars. As we describe in this paper, the Apache Point
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) provides data like
this.

We present oxygen abundances from OH lines in the H band
(1.5–1.7 µm) for disk stars over a wide range of distances ob-
served by APOGEE, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS). We overcome systematic eﬀects by considering
subsamples with similar atmospheric parameters. Within these
subsamples, we show that oxygen abundances are extremely pre-
cise, as quantiﬁed by the spread observed in open clusters, about
0.005 dex at 4000 K and solar metallicity. Based on these mea-
surements, for a sample that is roughly 100 times larger than in
any previous study and extends to the inner parts of the Galaxy,
we discuss the cosmic scatter in the oxygen-to-iron abundances
for the thin- and thick-disk stellar populations.

2. Analysis

Using the SDSS 2.5m telescope (Gunn et al. 2006), APOGEE
started in 2011 to map the chemical abundances of Milky
Way stars, with an emphasis on the dust-obscured popu-
lations in the central parts of
the Galaxy and the disk
(Majewski et al. 2015). The latest data release (SDSS-III DR12;
Alam et al. (2015), Holtzman et al. (2015)) includes spectra,
atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for some
150,000 stars. We refer to Zasowski et al. (2013), Nidever et al.
(2015), García Pérez et al. (2015), Shetrone et al. (2015), and
Zamora et al. (2015) for the details of the APOGEE targeting,
data processing, and analysis pipeline. The project observations
continue and will be complemented with a second, basically
identical, instrument from the southern hemisphere, starting in
2016 (Wilson et al. 2012).

2.1. Sampleselection

We based our analysis on the stars in DR12, adopting atmo-
spheric parameters and abundances included in that data re-
lease2. Nidever et al. (2014) examined the spread in [α/Fe] for
stars in the thin disk as a function of the median signal-to-noise
ratio per pixel (S /N) in the DR10 APOGEE spectra3 (Ahn et al.
2014), ﬁnding that the value ﬂattened at about 0.025 dex for
S /N > 300 (most APOGEE targets have been observed to 100 <
S /N < 200). The APOGEE Atmospheric Parameters and Chem-
ical Abundance Pipeline (ASPCAP; García Pérez et al. (2015))
determines an ’average’ α-element to iron ratio simultaneously
with the eﬀective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and
the abundances of carbon and nitrogen. This α-abundance is de-
rived by varying in block the abundances of O, Mg, Si, S, Ca,

and Ti. At low eﬀective temperature Teﬀ < 4500 K, the inferred
[α/Fe] follows mainly [O/Fe] due to the many OH lines in the H
band, but with contributions from atomic transitions of the other
α-elements.

Instead of [α/Fe], we examined the [O/Fe] values derived
from OH lines exclusively (the ‘calibrated’ values provided
as part of the ELEM array of abundances in DR12 – see
Holtzman et al. (2015) for details). Our [Fe/H] values are from
the corresponding calibrated values in the PARAM array. In an
attempt to retain the maximum precision avoiding systematic er-
rors, we separated stars into diﬀerent Teﬀ intervals and analyzed
each bin independently.

We selected stars in the APOGEE sample observed with the
SDSS 2.5m telescope that comply with the following require-
ments: 4000 < Teﬀ < 4600 K, −0.65 < [Fe/H] < +0.25 dex,
S /N > 80, χ2
red < 25, and since we rely on the calibrated ASP-
CAP parameters, only low-gravity stars were selected (log g <
3.8). The lowest eﬀective temperature was set at 4000 K to
avoid problems with the oxygen abundances from APOGEE for
cooler stars (Mészáros et al. 2013; Holtzman et al. 2015). In ad-
dition, we avoided bulge stars by restricting the range of pro-
jected galactocentric radii to Rg > 3 kpc and with |zg| < 2.5 kpc
(distances from Hayden et al. (2015)). After applying these ﬁl-
ters, our sample contains 16,870 stars.

2.2. Chemicalsplitbetweenthethinandthickdisk

Stars in the thin and thick disks can be statistically distinguished
based on their distance to the plane, age, kinematics, or chemical
compositions. The kinematic properties of both disks overlap,
and the available distances are not very accurate. On the other
hand, the intrinsic uncertainties in the determination of abun-
dances by the ASPCAP pipeline are very small, and therefore
we prefer to use chemistry to distinguish the membership of stars
in one of the two disk populations. From all the α-element abun-
dances provided by ASPCAP, we selected oxygen because of the
large number OH lines detected in the APOGEE spectra.

We split our sample into three bins in temperature and nine
bins in metallicity, with widths of 200 K and 0.1 dex, respec-
tively. The number of stars in each bin ranges from 210 to 1100.

Stars in the thin and thick disk split quite nicely into
[α/Fe] from the APOGEE measurements (Anders et al. 2014;
Hayden et al. 2014; Nidever et al. 2014). To separate the two
components, we used a least-squares ﬁt with a double Gaussian
to the [O/Fe] distribution from each bin, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
The standard deviation of each Gaussian is taken as the measured
scatter (cosmic plus measurement uncertainties). This method
provides reliable estimates of the scatter even when the separa-
tion between disks is not clear and they overlap, as is usually the
case. In addition, we can deﬁne a chemical division between the
disks in the intersection between the two Gaussians, except at
high [Fe/H] when the two populations completely overlap (see
Fig. 1).

The uncertainty for each bin in the [O/Fe] histogram (see the
right-hand panel in Fig. 1) was taken as the square root of the
number of stars in the bin. These were considered when ﬁtting
a double Gaussian. The square root of the diagonal of the co-
variance matrix provides the errors in the mean and σ for both
Gaussians.

2.3. Estimatingthe[O/Fe]uncertainties

To measure the cosmic dispersion of a certain element, we need
to not only measure the spread, but also properly estimate the ac-
tual uncertainties in our abundance measurements. The expected
errors in abundance measurements are often underestimated be-
cause it is diﬃcult to account for all relevant contributions. For
this reason, we did not attempt to calculate the uncertainties in
the oxygen abundances, but instead derived them empirically.
Thanks to the wide sky coverage of the APOGEE survey, multi-
ple clusters are included in our sample (Frinchaboy et al. 2013;
Mészáros et al. 2015).

We assumed that the cosmic variance in a cluster is neg-
ligible and therefore the measured scatter mainly reﬂects our
analysis uncertainties. Bovy (2016) has recently shown that the
APOGEE data can be used to set tight limits to the intrinsic
spread in the abundances of carbon and iron in open clusters
at . 0.01, and at . 0.015 for oxygen, which supports this ar-
gument. Globular clusters show multiple populations and abun-
dance anomalies, and therefore the measured spread in these sys-
tems provides only upper limits to the intrinsic uncertainties, but
even these are useful for our purposes.

We selected clusters from the list of APOGEE calibration
clusters with metallicity above −1.3 dex: M5, M67, M71, M107,
NGC 2158, NGC 6791, and NGC 6819. Stars observed in the
ﬁeld of each cluster were ﬁrst selected as potential members
according to their coordinates (stars within the cluster tidal ra-
dius), radial velocity (RV) in the range of ±30 km/s around the
mean cluster value, and avoiding dwarf stars. The mean clus-
ter RV were taken from the SIMBAD astronomical database
(Wenger et al. 2000), and the cluster radii are the same as were
used in Mészáros et al. 2013. The ﬁnal sample retains stars
within a 2σ interval around the mean [Fe/H] and RV of the po-
tential members.

We explored a broader range in [Fe/H] and Teﬀ than in our
sample (Sect. 2.1) to better map the sensitivity of the uncertain-
ties to these parameters. For each cluster we divided the stars
into Teﬀ bins and measured the [O/Fe] rms scatter in those with
more than one star. Since the stars in some clusters span multi-

ple bins, we have more data points than clusters. The results are
shown in Fig. 2. We ﬁnd that the scatter is a smooth function of
eﬀective temperature and metallicity and that the polynomial
σ[O/Fe]err =

closely follows the data with an rms scatter of 0.01 dex, but we
capped the polynomial predictions (σ[O/Fe]err) to avoid values
lower than 0.005 dex, the average of the three lowest data points
in our measurements. The M67 data point at Teﬀ ∼ 4300 K is the
only one that clearly deviates from the ﬁtted polynomial. This
is due to a star, 2MASS J08493465+1151256, whose RV and
[Fe/H] values agree with the cluster mean, but which shows a
remarkable diﬀerence of 0.09 dex in [O/Fe] with respect to the
mean value of the cluster. Nevertheless, we decided to keep this
star and avoid exceptions to our cluster selection criteria, since
it has a negligible eﬀect on our derived polynomial. In addition,
we did not discard the possibility that M67 might be chemically
inhomogeneous at the level of ∼0.02 dex, as has previously been
found in other open clusters (Liu et al. 2016).

To ensure that the cluster sample is representative of the
whole sample, we also examined the S /N4 of the data. While
the mean S /N of our sample is 295, clusters have on average
lower S /N values, except for M67 (S /N ∼ 545), NGC 6819
(S /N ∼ 324), and NGC 2420 (S /N ∼ 316). The remaining clus-
ters have a S /N between 150 and 200. We study this matter in
more detail below.

2.4. [O/Fe]dispersionagainstsignal-to-noiseratio

Nidever et al. (2014) have shown that the empirical scatter in
[α/Fe] for the low-α stars in APOGEE decreases exponentially
as a function of S /N, reaching a plateau of ∼0.023 dex at
S /N &200.

4 We deﬁne S /N as the median value for a given spectrum. The re-
ported values tend to be optimistic for S /N & 300, which in this range
is limited by imperfections in the behavior of IR detectors.

Fig. 2. Spread in the ratio of oxygen to iron abundances measured in
diﬀerent clusters as a function of the mean Teﬀ and [Fe/H]. The back-
ground color indicates the variations predicted by the polynomial ﬁt to
the data (capped to have minimum value of 0.005 dex), and follows the
same color code as used for the individual data points. The error bars
shown for the data points reﬂect the standard deviation. The stars from
our sample lie in the region marked with dashed lines.

After we separated between thin- and thick-disk stars in our
sample, we calculated the dependence between the standard de-
viation in [O/Fe] as a function of the S /N. We selected stars
with 4200< Teﬀ <4600 K and 0.05<[Fe/H]<-0.45 dex. Lower
temperatures or higher metallicities were avoided to guarantee a
minimum number of 25 stars per bin for both disks. Following
the same method as was used to calculate the scatter and split
the disks, we divided our sample into bins of Teﬀ and S /N. For
each bin we ﬁt a third-order polynomial to the [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]
trend to subtract it, and then ﬁt a Gaussian proﬁle to the [O/Fe]
histogram. The scatter in [O/Fe] was taken as the standard devi-
ation of this Gaussian. Finally, we averaged the scatter found for
diﬀerent temperatures at the same S /N. As can be seen in Fig. 3,
the dispersion in [O/Fe] does indeed depend on S /N. Although
we do not reach a dispersion as small as Nidever et al. (2014),
the trends are very similar.

We also show data for the clusters, avoiding those with pa-
rameters that are very diﬀernt from those of our sample. The
scatter in this case is calculated as the standard deviation of
[O/Fe] for each bin because we do not have enough stars per
bin to perform a Gaussian ﬁt. Our cluster sample spans a wide
range in S /N, but their dispersions are still remarkably lower
than those from our sample. We therefore conclude that our es-
timates of the measurement uncertainties from clusters are not
underestimated because of the diﬀerences between clusters and
sample S /N. We note, nonetheless, that the uncertainties in the
cluster data are larger than in the sample data as a result of the
limited number of stars per cluster for each bin of stellar param-
eters.

3. Results and conclusions

ity bin. The black line shows the estimated uncertainties in the

in these uncertainties between the extreme temperature values in each

APOGEE [O/Fe] ratios from the dispersion empirically mea-
sured in open clusters, while the gray area indicates the vari-
ation between extreme temperature values in each temperature
bin. The estimated uncertainties reach a minimum value of 0.005
dex for solar-metallicity stars with Teﬀ ≃ 4000 K and increase
for warmer or more metal-poor stars.

The APOGEE measurements unambiguously detect the cos-
mic scatter in [O/Fe] at any given metallicity. The [O/Fe] scatter
is not very diﬀerent in the thin and thick disks, and the disks
show an approximately ﬂat value between 0.03–0.04 dex over
the entire range of metallicity considered.

Our APOGEE sample includes disk stars at distances of
up to 30 kpc from the Sun (75% of the sample are within
6 < Rg < 12 kpc), and therefore it is interesting to compare our
derived scatter in [O/Fe] with the value for the thin disk from
Nissen (2015), which was based on solar twins within ∼ 40 pc.
Nissen’s oxygen abundances are based on a single feature, the
weak forbidden line at 630 nm, which is blended with a Ni I
transition, and this is likely to cause part of the scatter in [O/Fe]
he reported. We therefore chose to compare our results with the
scatter he reported for other α elements that show a similar cor-
relation between abundance and age, namely Mg, Si, S, or Ti.
In these, the scatter in [X/Fe] is 0.022, 0.016, 0.021, and 0.017
dex, respectively. Taking σ[α/Fe]local = 0.02 dex as a represen-
tative value, we show it in Fig. 4 with a green solid line. The
APOGEE [O/Fe] ratios show nearly twice as much scatter as the
value found in the immediate vicinity of the Sun.

Nissen (2015) found that a signiﬁcant fraction of the scatter
in [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [S/Fe], or [Ti/Fe] among thin-disk stars in
the solar neighborhood can be attributed to chemical evolution.
These abundance ratios correlate tightly with stellar age, and

Fig. 3. 1-σ standard deviation in the ratio of oxygen to iron abundances as a function of the S/N for stars with 4200< Teﬀ <4600 K and
0.05<[Fe/H]<-0.45 dex. An exponential is ﬁtted to the data points, weighted with the corresponding uncertainties. The point at very high S /N
corresponds to the M67 bin that contains a star whose [O/Fe] is remarkably diﬀerent from the cluster average (see Sect. 2.3)

when the age trend is removed, the scatter reduces to ∼ 0.01 dex,
or about half of that before removing the trend. Obviously, this
contribution must be present in the APOGEE sample, but since
the volume probed by APOGEE observations is much larger, ad-
ditional eﬀects are likely to contribute to the scatter.

The abundance of [Fe/H] or the alpha elements [α/H] de-
creases signiﬁcantly with galactocentric distance for the thin
disk at about 0.05 dex/kpc, while variations are much smaller
for the thick disk (Hayden et al. 2014). On the other hand, at any
given [Fe/H], the changes in [O/Fe] as a function of galactocen-
tric distance are very small for both populations. If we use the
APOGEE data to evaluate how much the mean radial and vertical
gradients contribute to the scatter, we ﬁnd that its contribution is
negligible.

As a result of radial migration, stars currently in the so-
lar neighborhood were formed at a wide range of galactocen-
tric distances, between 2 and 13 kpc, with about 75% of them
formed at galactocentric distances between 3 and 9 kpc (e.g.,
Minchev et al. 2013). This range, however, is not much larger
than that spanned by the stars in the APOGEE sample, but the
latter have also been subjected to radial mixing and therefore
sample a larger volume of the disk. Spatial variations in the star
formation rate or in the gas outﬂow rate could be responsible
for the larger scatter. Indeed, limiting our APOGEE sample to
stars at less than 1 kpc from the Sun, we measure a scatter of
∼0.03 dex in the solar neighborhood. On the other hand, stars at
more than 4 kpc from the Galactic plane show a scatter that rises
to ∼0.1 dex, suggesting that the dispersion in [O/Fe] is larger in
the Milky Way halo than in the disk.

The potential use of information on the spread in abundance
ratios at any given metallicity can be illustrated with a back-of-
the-envelope calculation. With an average expansion speed of
103 km s−1 and a time for the ejecta to merge into the ISM of
about 104 years, a supernova remnant can pollute a region ∼ 10
pc in radius5. Assuming a typical mass of metals in the ejecta of
∼ 1 M⊙, a single supernova increases the density of metals in the
surrounding ISM by ∼ 5 × 1026 kg pc−3. A maximum density

currently expanding at about 900 km s−1 and has a radius of about 3 pc.

for the ISM where stars form is given by the typical density for
a molecular cloud, about 5 × 1032 kg pc−3, and therefore the ﬁrst
Galactic supernova would bring the metallicity of the surround-
ing ISM to [Fe/H]∼ −3.

The variance in metallicity across individual zones, ∼10 pc
in size, will be large in the early Galaxy, but as more and more
supernova explode, this variance will be progressively reduced.
Considering the metallicity distribution at the present time in-
volves measuring the variance both spatially (across zones) and
over time. Considering the spread in abundance ratios at any
given metallicity would be more similar to evaluating the vari-
ance across zones at a particular moment in time, but we note
that this is a rough approximation because the age metallicity
relationship in the Milky Way disk is only loosely deﬁned (e.g.,
Edvardsson et al. 1993; Haywood et al. 2013).

Based on these order-of-magnitude arguments and assuming
that low-mass stars form at a constant rate, we can show numeri-
cally that a constant supernova rate of about 0.01 to 0.1 per 10-pc
zone per million years would lead, after 1010 years, to a metallic-
ity distribution with a 1−σ dispersion across zones and over all
ages of about 0.2 dex and would at the same time produce a dis-
persion about ten times smaller over zones at any given moment
in time in the last ∼ 5 × 109 years, consistent with the spread in
the metallicity distribution in the thin or thick disks (about 0.2
dex) and with the spread in oxygen abundances that we ﬁnd at
any given metallicity (0.02–0.04 dex).

We can furthermore support this claim by assuming that the
Galactic disk is a ﬂat cylinder 30 kpc in diameter and 1 kpc
in height. The cylinder would contain some 108 zones of 10 pc
each6. A supernova rate of 0.01 per zone per million years im-
plies n = 1010 supernovae in the entire Galactic disk in 1010 yr.
The events will be distributed following a binomial distribution
with a mean of 1010×10−8 = 102 supernovae per zone and a stan-
dard deviation of p1010 × 10−8 × (1 − 10−8) ≃ 10, which leads
to a spread in metals of 10/100/ln(10.) = 0.04 dex.

6 The volume of the Galactic cylinder would be 7 × 1011 pc3, which
divided by the volume of the sphere polluted by a supernova remnant,
4 × 103 pc3, gives us the number of zones.

These simple arguments indicate that the star formation rate
must have been much higher in the past than it is now – one
supernova per century, the current rate, is roughly equivalent to
10−4 supernova per 10-pc zone per million years. A quantita-
tive discussion requires more sophisticated models. We conclude
that as the precision of our abundance analyses reaches and sur-
passes 0.01 dex, new diagnostics will become available to con-
strain models of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.
