Abstract. We study the eﬃciency of modulated laser pulses to produce eﬃcient and
fast charge localization transitions in a two-electron double quantum dot. We use a
conﬁguration interaction method to calculate the electronic structure of a quantum dot
model within the eﬀective mass approximation. The interaction with the electric ﬁeld
of the laser is considered within the dipole approximation and optimal control theory
is applied to design high-ﬁdelity ultrafast pulses in pristine samples. We assessed the
inﬂuence of the presence of Coulomb charged impurities on the eﬃciency and speed
of the pulses. A protocol based on a two-step optimization is proposed for preserving
both advantages of the original pulse. The processes aﬀecting the charge localization
is explained from the dipole transitions of the lowest lying two-electron states, as
described by a discrete model with an eﬀective electron-electron interaction.

Optimal control of a charge qubit in a double quantum dot with a Coulomb impurity 2

1. Introduction

Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are excellent candidates for realizing qubits for
quantum information processing because of the manipulability, scalability and tunability
of their electronic and optical properties [1, 2, 3, 4]. Advances in semiconductor
technology allow the preparation of complex structures and a ﬁne experimental control
of the parameters deﬁning their electrical and optical properties [5, 6, 7].

In recent years there has been an increasing interest in controlling quantum
phenomena in molecular systems and nanodevices [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], due to the
possibility to modify the wave function of the system through the appropriate tailoring of
external ﬁelds such as laser pulses. Coherent quantum control of electrons in quantum
dots exposed to electromagnetic radiation is of great interest in many technological
applications from charge transport devices to quantum information [16, 17, 18]. Several
studies in quantum control of double quantum dots (DQDs) has been performed using
gate voltages and optimized laser pulses [19, 20, 21]. In addition, the number of quantum
control experiments is rapidly rising through the improvement of laser pulse shaping and
closed-loop learning techniques[19, 20, 21].

[31] and Rabitz et al.

Among other techniques, Optimal Control Theory (OCT) [22, 23, 24, 25] has
become an eﬃcient tool for designing laser pulses able to control quantum processes.
The optimal ﬁeld is the ﬁeld employed in order to steer a dynamical system from
a initial state to a desired target state minimizing a cost functional which generally
penalizes the energy (ﬂuence) of the pulse. A great eﬀort has been invested in recent
years in the development of diﬀerent methods in order to solve the optimal equations
[26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. Monotonically convergent iterative schemes proposed by Tannor
et al.
[32] have been successfully applied to the control of
diﬀerent quantum phenomena, mainly related to chemical process [33, 34].
In the
last years, optimal control theory became a research area that has received increasing
interest from the scientists studying emerging ﬁelds within quantum information science
[35, 36]. Modern quantum devices are systems where the wave function must be
manipulated with highest possible precision using, for example, quantum gates. This
high-ﬁdelity quantum engineering needs new and eﬃcient strategies which allow an
optimal suppression of environment losses during gating or optical control. In addition,
quantum computation theoretically requires extremely high ﬁdelity in the elementary
quantum state transformations. Optical control of quantum dot based devices is
of fundamental
interest for a wide range of applications in quantum information
[35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. For example, optical manipulation is an alternative in order
to store qubits in the electron spin [35]. Hansen et. al [36] show that carefully selected
microwave pulses can be used to populate a single state of the ﬁrst excitation band in
a two-electron DQD and that the transition time can be decreased using optimal pulse
control. Heller et. al [41] show that the quality of periodic recurrence (quantum revival)
in the time evolution in a quantum well, can be restored almost completely by coupling
the system to an electromagnetic ﬁeld obtained using quantum optimal control theory.

It results clear that the study of quantum dynamics of nanodevices and the possibility of
controlling diﬀerent processes in such systems represent an important research ﬁeld with
very interesting technological applications. The implementation of numerical techniques
such as OCT allow us to analyze diﬀerent possibilities and scenarios in order to construct
and improve nanodevices based quantum bits.

It is known that the presence of impurity centers has a great inﬂuence on the optical
and electronic properties of nanostructured materials. Recent works [42, 43, 44, 45, 46,
47, 48] studied the eﬀects of having unintentional charged impurities in two-electron
laterally coupled two-dimensional double quantum-dot systems. They analyzed the
eﬀects of quenched random-charged impurities on the singlet-triplet exchange coupling
and spatial entanglement in two-electron double quantum-dots. Although there is an
enormous interest in applying these systems in quantum information technologies, there
are few works trying to quantify the eﬀect of charged impurities on this kind of tasks.
The existence of unintentional impurities, which are always present in nanostructured
devices, aﬀects seriously the possibility of using these devices as quantum bits. Although
the distribution and concentration of impurities in these systems result unknown
parameters, there are some recent works that propose the possibility of experimentally
control these issues [49, 50, 51, 52].
Impurity doping in semiconductor materials is
considered as a useful technology that has been exploited to control optical and electronic
properties in diﬀerent nanodevices.

It is worth to mention that, due to environmental perturbations, these systems
lose coherence. For example, conﬁned electrons interact with spin nuclei through the
hyperﬁne interaction leading, inevitably, to decoherence [3]. Even, having just one
charged impurity could induce qubit decoherence if this impurity is dynamic and has
a ﬂuctuation time scale comparable to gate operation time scales [42]. Decoherence is
a phenomenon that plays a central role in quantum information and its technological
applications [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]. The short transition time in optically
driven processes reduces the eﬀect of decoherence sources, such as hyperﬁne or phonon
interactions. A number of known quantum control techniques such as quantum bang-
bang control [63] or spin-echo pulses [3] allow experimentalists to ﬁght decoherence. It
seems reasonable that optimal control theory can be considered as a tool in order to
design control pulses or gates so that quantum systems can be controlled in presence of
environmental couplings without suﬀering signiﬁcant decoherence.

The aim of this work is to present a detailed analysis of the optical control of
two electrons in a two-dimensional coupled quantum dot and the eﬀect of impurities
by means of Optimal Control Theory. The paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. 2
we introduce the model for the two-dimensional two-electron coupled quantum dot and
brieﬂy describe the method used to calculate its electronic structure. In Sec. 2.2, we
describe optimal control equations for a two-dimensional two-electron coupled quantum
dot. In Sec. 3 we analize the operation of a charge qubit in presence of impurities. In
Sec. 4, we propose a protocol of initialization (Sec. 4.1) and operation (Sec. 4.2) of
the qubit using electromagnetic pulses avoiding the eﬀects of the impurities by means

Optimal control of a charge qubit in a double quantum dot with a Coulomb impurity 4

of OCT. Finally, In Sec. 5 we summarize the conclusions with a discussion of the most
relevant points of our analysis.

2. Model and calculation method

We consider two laterally coupled two-dimensional quantum dots whose centers are
separated a distance d from each other, and containing two electrons.
In quantum
dots electrostatically produced, both their size and separation can be controlled by
variable gate voltages through metallic electrodes deposited on the heterostructure
interface. The eventual existence of doping hydrogenic impurities, probably arising
from Si dopant atoms in the GaAs quantum well, have been experimentally studied
[45]. These impurities have been theoretically analyzed with a superimposed attractive
1/r-type potential [46, 47]. Furthermore, some avoided crossing and lifted degeneracies
in the spectra of single-electron transport experiments have been attributed to negatively
charged Coulomb impurities located near to the QD [48]. From ﬁtting the experimental
transport spectra to a single-electron model of softened parabolic conﬁnement with
a Coulomb charge q, a set of parameters are obtained; among them, a radius of
conﬁnement of 15.5 nm, a conﬁnement frequency ω = 13.8 meV and an impurity charge
of approximately 1 or 2 electron charges. Indeed, the uncertainty in the parameters and
the suppositions introduced in the model does not allow one to precisely ensure the
impurity charge, with the screening probably reducing its eﬀective value to less than an
electron charge. Therefore, we consider the charge of the doping atom Ze as a parameter
varying in the range 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1, in order to explore its eﬀect on the properties of the
system.

2.1. Electronic structure and dynamics

In this work we model the Hamiltonian of the two-dimensional two-electron coupled
quantum dot in presence of charged impurities within the single conduction-band
eﬀective-mass approximation [37], namely,

H0 = h(r1) + h(r2) +

e2

4πεε0r12

where ri = (xi, yi) (i = 1, 2) and

h(r) = −

2

2m∗∇2 + VL(r) + VR(r) + VA(r),

(1)

(2)

where h(r) is the single-electron Hamiltonian that includes the kinetic energy of the
electrons, in terms of their eﬀective mass m∗, and the conﬁning potential for the left
and right quantum dots VL and VR, and the interaction of the electrons with the charged
impurities, VA.

The last term of the Hamiltonian, Eq.

(1), represents the Coulomb repulsive
interaction between both electrons at a distance r12 = |r2 − r1| apart from each other,

within a material of eﬀective dielectric constant ε. We model the conﬁnement with
Gaussian attractive potentials

Vi(r) = −V0 exp(cid:18)−

(3)

where RL and RR are the positions of the center of the left and right dots, V0 denotes
the depth of the potential and a can be taken as a measure of its range. Along this work,
we will consider a single impurity atom centered at RA, and modelled as a hydrogenic
two-dimensional Coulomb potential

VA(r) = −

Ze2

4πεε0|RA − r|

(4)

Since the Hamiltonian does not depend on the electron spin, its eigenstates can be

factored out as a product of a spatial and a spin part

Ψi(r1, r2, ms1, ms2) = ΨS

i (r1, r2)χS,M ,

(5)

where S = 0, 1 for singlet and triplet states, respectively, and M = ms1 + ms2 is the
total spin projection.

The eigenstates of the model Hamiltonian can be obtained by direct diagonalization
in a ﬁnite basis set [64]. The spatial part is obtained, in a full conﬁguration interaction
(CI) calculation, as

We chose a single-particle basis of Gaussian functions, centered at the dots and

atom positions RP (P = L, R, A), of the type [65, 66]

φi(r) = N(x − Px)mi(y − Py)ni exp(cid:0)−αi|r − RP|2(cid:1) ,

(8)

where N is a normalization constant, and ℓi = mi + ni is the z-projection of the angular
momentum of the basis function. The exponents αi were optimized for a single Gaussian
well and a single atom separately, and supplemented with extra functions when used
together. For our calculations a basis set of 2s2p functions for the dots, and 5s5p1d1f
for the atom was found to achieve converged results for the energy spectrum.

The numerical results presented in this work refers to those corresponding to the
parameters of GaAs: eﬀective mass m∗ = 0.067me, eﬀective dielectric constant ε = 13.1,

[48, 42].
The depth of the Gaussian potentials modelling the dots are taken as V0 = 4
Hartree∗ = 42.4 meV, and its typical range a = √2a∗
B = 14.1 nm, with an interdot
separation 22.5 nm. Smaller interdot separations provides a high electric dipole moment
and, hence, strong coupling with the laser ﬁeld but induce delocalization of the electrons
making diﬃcult to to deﬁne the occupation on a single dot. Larger interdot separation
produces the opposite eﬀect, with the drawback of small coupling with the laser electric
ﬁeld, thus worsening the controlability of the QDs.

2.2. Optimal Control Theory for electrons interacting with a time-dependent electric
ﬁeld

Let us consider a laser ﬁeld ε(t) pointing along the line joining the QDs (x direction) and
propagating along the z direction (perpendicular to the plane of the system). The time
evolution of the electron state, assuming the dipole approximation for the interaction,
will be given by

where µ is x-component of the dipole moment operator.

Application of optimal control theory (OCT) allows to design a pulse of duration T ,
whose interaction drives the system to a state Ψ(T ), having maximum overlap to a given
state φF or, equivalently, maximizes the expectation value of the operator O = |φFihφF|
at the end of the pulse application [25]:

where J1 is known as the yield.

In order to avoid high energy ﬁelds we introduce a

(12)

where the time-integrated intensity is known as the ﬂuence of the ﬁeld, F is the ﬁxed
ﬂuence and α is a time-independent Lagrange multiplier.
In addition the electronic
wave function has to satisfy the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation, introducing a
third functional:

J3[ε, Ψ, χ] = −2ImZ T

where we have introduced the time-dependent Lagrange multiplier χ(t). Finally, the
Lagrange functional has the form J = J1 + J2 + J3. The Variation of this functional
with respect to Ψ(t), ε(t) and χ(t) allows us to obtain the control equations [30]

This set of coupled equations can be solved iteratively, for example, using the eﬃcient
forward-backward propagation scheme developed in [31]. The algorithm starts by
propagating φ(r1, r2) forward in time, using in the ﬁrst step a guess of the laser ﬁeld
ε0(t). At the end of this step we obtain the wave function Ψ(0)(r1, r2, T ), which is
used to evaluate χ(0)(r1, r2, T ) = |φFihφF|Ψ(0)(r1, r2, T )i. The algorithm continues with
propagating χ(0)(r1, r2, t) backwards in time. In this step we need to know both wave
functions (Ψ(0) and χ(0)) at the same time. In this step we obtain the ﬁrst optimized pulse
ε1(t). We repeat this operation until the convergence of J is achieved. The Lagrange
multiplier α is calculated using the ﬁxed ﬂuence following the calculation details showed
in reference[31]. The numerical integration of the forward and backward time evolution
was performed using fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithms.

As usual in this technique, we constrain the ﬁeld using an envelope function [30, 26],

in order to have a electromagnetic pulse ε(t) with a ﬁnite duration, i.e., ε(0) = ε(T ) = 0.
Furthermore, a spectral cut-oﬀ is applied to remove frequency components higher than
a prescribed threshold ωc [31].

3. Controllability of the charge qubit states in the presence of an impurity

Firstly, we will analyze the controllability of a symmetrical DQD in a clean sample.
The absence of impurities means that the only relevant potentials are those from the
conﬁning wells. Then, the electronic ground state, Ψ0(r1, r2), is spatially delocalized,
with a high density around each dot. The ﬁrst and second excited states, Ψ1 and Ψ2,
have very close energies, what allows one to deﬁne the doubly occupied states at the left
and right dots as ΨLL/RR(r1, r2) = 2−1/2 [Ψ1(r1, r2) ± Ψ2(r1, r2)]. Let us consider one
of them, say ΨRR, as the target state for optimizing the laser ﬁeld. Thus the optimal
ﬁeld will produce a delocalization-localization transition of the electron charge, which
could be detected by measuring the charge variation at the dots. Fig. 1 shows the yield
obtained in the transition Ψ0 → ΨRR where one electron is moved from the left to the
right dot. As we can observe in the lower panel of Fig. 1, for a ﬁxed ﬂuence, a high yield
is obtained by extending the pulse duration. On the other hand, for a given duration
of the pulse, the yield becomes larger as the ﬂuence increases (as shown in upper panel

Optimal control of a charge qubit in a double quantum dot with a Coulomb impurity 8

of Fig. 1). Therefore, the most convenient situation corresponds to that where a long
pulse of high intensity is applied. However, the pulse duration cannot be arbitrarily
long because the coherence time have the order of nanoseconds. So, in order to perform
operations cyclically with the qubit, the pulse has to be restricted to tens or hundreds
of picoseconds.

Figure 1. (Color online) (a) Yield as a function of ﬂuence F , for three diﬀerent values
of pulse duration T = 5, 7 and 10 ps. (b) Yield as a function of time duration of the
pulse for three diﬀerent values of ﬂuence, F = 3.7 × 10−3, 6.3 × 10−2 and 1.3 × 10−3
mV2/nm2ps.

Now consider the eﬀect produced by charged impurities. If the sample were heavily
doped, that is, it has a high impurity density or their charges are high (i.e., comparable
to the electron charge) the system is far from being controllable. Therefore, we shall
consider the situation where the density of impurities is low, such that no more than
one of them is in the neighbourhood of the DQD. We also assume that their charge
Ze is small, characterized by an eﬀective parameter Z < 0.5 (meaning that it is highly
screened), a range which has been considered suitable in a previous work [65].

Fig.

2 shows the calculated yield obtained when the pulse optimized for the
transition Ψ0 → ΨRR in the clean DQD, is applied to the doped DQD having a Coulomb
point charge Ze located at the mid point between both quantum dots. Fig. 2 shows that
for ultrashort pulses of a few picoseconds, even very small impurity charges can heavily
deteriorate the performance of the optimal pulse. The unintentional impurities act as
trapping centers for the electrons, spoiling the fast operation of the pulses optimally
designed for the clean device.

In the next section we propose and discuss a protocol for controlling the electronic

Figure 2. (Color online) Calculated yields for pulses of 5, 7 and 10 ps as a function of
the magnitude of the eﬀective charge Z of an impurity localized in the middle of the
dots. The pulses were optimized for the double quantum dot without impurity, with a
ﬂuence of F = 1.3×10−3 mV2/nm2, and applied to the system containing the Coulomb
impurity. The yield is nearly 1 for Z = 0, but it becomes strongly deteriorated even
for small values of Z.

states using OCT in order to avoid the deterioration introduced by a charge impurity
located in between the dots.

4. OCT-based two-step protocol

Although the OCT pulses produce fast transitions between localized and delocalized
states in a clean DQD, with high ﬁdelity, they fail after adding a Coulomb charge.
This is due to the fact that, in the presence of the charge, the spatial distribution of the
electron wave function of the system is not only localized around the QDs, but also in the
proximity of the center of the Coulomb potential. Nevertheless, for a proper operation
and detection of the electron charges in the QDs (e.g., using quantum point contacts) it
is desirable that both the initial and target qubit states correspond to electron densities
predominantly localized around the QDs.

Our proposed protocol consists in using OCT for tailoring two pulses, to be
sequentially applied, in order to induce the transitions Ψ0 → Ψ(0)
RR. Firstly,
an initialization pulse is designed for the transition Ψ0 → Ψ(0)
0 , i.e., a pulse by which
the electrons initially in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with the impurity (H (Z))
are set in the ground state of the Hamiltonian without impurity (H (0)). Immediately
afterwards, the second pulse drives the wave function to perform the same transition
as in the clean system, i.e., Ψ(0)
RR. This second pulse has all the previously
discussed advantages of fast and high-ﬁdelity evolution, and correspond to the desired
qubit operation, e.g., for information processing.

0 → Ψ(0)

0 → Ψ(0)

The inﬂuence of the impurity charge could, in principle, spoil and slow down the
whole process because it enters in two ways: (i) the initialization pulse introduces an
additional evolution time to set the wave function in the state Ψ(0)
0 . As a consequence,

Optimal control of a charge qubit in a double quantum dot with a Coulomb impurity 10

the operation of the device with an impurity, performed between the same pair of states,
will be necessarily slower than without impurities present, and the ﬁdelity, for a ﬁxed
pulse duration, could depend strongly on Z; (ii) although the operation pulse produces
a transition between impurity-free states Ψ(0)
RR, they are to be represented
0
in terms of states of the whole Hamiltonian as Ψ(0)
depending on the charge Z. We shall show in the following, however, that none of these
circumstances eliminates the advantages of the procedure, which holds a high ﬁdelity
with operation times lesser than the typical dephasing times.

and Ψ(0)
i = Pj cij(Z)Ψj, with coeﬃcients

4.1. Initialization of the qubit

We consider three diﬀerent values for the charge of the impurity, namely, Z = 0.1,
0.2 and 0.3, corresponding to the conditions of weak and intermediate strength of the
Coulomb potential competing with the conﬁning ones in the QDs.

Firstly, we calculated pulses by optimizing them without imposing any restriction
on the maximum allowed frequency. As a result, the yield increases monotonically with
the ﬂuence until reaching a plateau having a maximum value of 99.9% for Z = 0.1
and 99.4% for Z = 0.3. These maximum yields are reached nearly at F = 1.3 × 10−3
mV2/nm2. On the other hand, when a cut-oﬀ frequency ωc is imposed, the increase in
the yield is similar until the aforementioned value of ﬂuence. Nevertheless, instead of the
plateaus of the unconstrained pulses, the yield of frequency-constrained pulses reaches a
top and then oscillates, with a slight decrease in average. Remarkably, the use of a cut-oﬀ
frequency ωc = 20 THz, compatible with current experimental capabilities, aﬀects more
strongly the yield of the systems with smaller impurity charges. This behaviour can be
attributed to the fact that, for low ﬂuence pulses, the electron can only be promoted to
the low-lying levels having small excitation energy. On the other hand, pulses of larger
ﬂuence entail a larger amplitude and excitation energies to higher states. While the
unconstrained pulses have a suitable frequency composition to produce the excitation
to the higher levels, the frequency constrained pulses do not have the higher frequency
required to excite the electrons to the higher levels. Therefore, some transitions involving
highly excited states are inhibited, leading to a decrease in the yield. In other words,
for systems with a large impurity charge, its electronic structure is mainly determined
by the lowest lying (i.e., by the low frequency or low excitation energy) states of the
Coulomb potential. Therefore, in such cases, both pulses, with and without cut-oﬀ,
are almost equally well suited for producing the maximum yield which, nevertheless,
becomes smaller than for small impurity charges.

We assessed the approach to the target state along the time by designing a 10
ps pulse having a cut-oﬀ frequency ωmax = 20 THz for three values of Z (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 shows the result of applying OCT to initialize the DQD device. The yield
reaches a high value after about 103 iterations of the optimization procedure, although
typically 104 iterations have been used in the calculations. The Fourier spectrum of
the optimized pulses show only a few relevant frequencies giving smoothly oscillating

middle of the segment of line joining the centers of the dots. Application of this pulse

ﬁelds experimentally realizable. These initialization pulses have diﬀerent characteristics
depending on the magnitude of the impurity charge. For the system with Z = 0.1, the
electron population of the ground state is gradually transferred to the ﬁrst excited state
until approximately a half of the pulse length, when both occupations reach about 70%
and 30%, respectively. In the second half of the pulse, the electron population is again
restored to the ground state. Only the two lowest states are involved in the transition
Ψ0 → Ψ(0)
0 because, for small Z, both ground states are rather similar, and the pulse
frequency is mainly determined by the energy diﬀerence between the ground and ﬁrst
excited states of H (Z).

Fig. 4 shows the form of the optimized 10 ps pulse (upper panel) and the time
dependence of the level occupations for the low lying states for Z = 0.3 resulting from
its application (lower panel). The pulse, although quite simple, is not monochromatic;
the most relevant frequencies in its spectral composition are shifted downwards due to
the level mixing between the DQD and the charged Coulomb ion, which have a smaller
energy separation. The three dominant frequencies ωij can be identiﬁed as related to
transitions between the low-lying levels Ψi → Ψj, with the main contribution coming
from ω01 ≃ 14 THz and minor ones from ω12 ≃ 0.13 THz and ω24 ≃ 4.6 THz. The lower
panel of Fig. 4 shows the time variation of the level occupation for the ﬁrst ﬁve states
during application of the pulse. The ground state occupation n0 decreases less than
10% by the mid of the pulse duration, transferring population to the ﬁrst excited state
and, to less extent, to the second and fourth excited states. At the end of the pulse,
the population n0 remains high (close to 95%) while the rest populates the state ΨZ
3
and ΨZ
5 . In a wide range of cases studied, the pulses obtained from the OCT procedure
for initialization of the qubit, under conditions of low ﬂuence and frequency cut-oﬀ
compatible with current experimental capabilities, have been found to be rather simple,

4.2. Operation of the qubit

0 → Ψ(0)

We address now the problem of producing the transition of interest for operating the
qubit, Ψ(0)
RR, and how it is aﬀected by the presence of the Coulomb charge. Fig.
5 shows the yield for the transition from the state Ψ(0)
0 , obtained with the initialization
pulse discussed above, for Z = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, together with the Z = 0.0 case for
the sake of comparison. The pulses were optimized to induce fast transitions (10 ps
duration), yet they still hold high ﬁdelity with the desired target state. Interestingly,
Fig. 5 shows that the system, in presence of the charge, evolves to the target state faster
than the clean QDs. A yield of 90% can be reached in around 7 ps for the Z = 0.3
DQD, which is 2 ps shorter than for the clean system.

The optimal pulse for targeting the localized state Ψ(0)

RR, after the initialization
pulse, is shown at the upper panel in Fig. 6. The resulting yield and the variations of

the occupation of the lower-lying states is depicted in the lower panel of Fig. 6. As
shown, the transition mainly involves the three lowest states of the DQD, namely, the
ground state Ψ0, and ﬁrst and second excited states, Ψ1 and Ψ2. The third and forth
excited states Ψ3 and Ψ4 also gives, to a less extent, some smaller contribution during the
second half of the pulse. The yield reaches a value & 99.9% after 10 ps, with a steadily
increasing behaviour although with oscillations of ∼ 10% during the second half of the
pulse (i.e., between 5 and 10 ps). The examination of the time dependence of the state
occupations allows us to explain how the target state is built and this high ﬁdelity is
reached. During the ﬁrsts 4 ps, the population of the ground state is transferred almost
exclusively to the state |1i. In the next 4 ps (from 4 to 8 ps.) the population of the
ground state |0i continues decreasing monotonically but part of the electronic charge is
also transferred to the state |2i. As a remarkable feature of the ﬁgure, the occupations
of the states |1i and |2i show complementary peaks and dips of oscillations mounted on
a smooth variation. Peaks of one curve occurs at the dips of the other, entailing that
part of the charge is oscillating between states |1i ↔ |2i. Finally, during the last 2 ps.
the states |1i and |2i approach to be nearly equally populated in order to reach the
target state. Nevertheless, there is a small but observable diﬀerence between them due
to the occupation of higher excited states.

The dynamical process of reaching the target state described above, and the
inﬂuence of the impurity charge on the controllability, can be understood from an
analysis of the electronic structure of our system, as sketched in Fig. 7.
It shows
the two electron wave function along the x axis joining both dots, Ψi(x1, 0; x2, 0), as
a contour plot of the variables (x1, x2), for the three lowest energy levels of the DQD
without impurities (Fig. 7a) and in the presence of an impurity of charge Z = 0.3 (Fig.
7b). Positive and negative xi coordinates refer to positions of electron i close to right and
left wells, respectively. When the two-electron state corresponds to a situation where,
spatially, each electron is in a diﬀerent well, the wave function have large values along
the x1 = −x2 diagonal (ց) and represents a delocalized two-electron state. On the
other hand, high values around the diagonal x1 = x2 (ր) entails for double occupation,
i.e., when both electrons are in one of the wells. Therefore, irrespective of the presence
or not of the Coulomb charge, Figs. 7a and 7b show that the ground state |0i is a
two-electron state describing electrons delocalized at diﬀerent wells. Excited states |1i
and |2i, on the other hand, are mainly along the ր direction, i.e., they represent double
occupation of the wells. State |1i has a nodal line along direction ց while |2i has not,
meaning that |1i and |2i have ungerade and gerade symmetry under inversion through
the interdot center x = 0. The changes in the states from Fig. 7a to Fig. 7b, due to
the charge Z, are apparent; states with Z 6= 0 have a noticeable contribution from the
impurity location x1 = x2 = 0. More information, to be discussed below, is provided in
panels (c) and (d); they show the dependence of the electronic energy of the ﬁve lowest
states (Fig. 7c) and the two matrix elements of the dipole operator X = x1 + x2 that
give rise to the most relevant transitions (Fig. 7d), as a function of the Coulomb charge
Z, respectively.

Further insight can be gained by approximating the system by a two-sites Hubbard
model having hopping w, on-site Coulomb repulsion U, and one orbital per site ϕA
(A=L, R). Assuming zero on-site energies for both wells and strong repulsion (w ≪ U),
its three lowest (non-normalized) singlet states and energies are

respect to the interdot center. In the strongly correlated regime, E1 and E2 are quasi-
degenerates, as in our CI calculations (Fig. 7c). In such regime, our target state can
be approximated as ΨRR = (Ψg
D)/2 ≈ (Ψ2 − Ψ1)/2. Due to the point symmetry,
dipole matrix elements µij = hΨi|X|Ψji are such that µ02 = 0, but µ01 6= 0 6= µ12.
Hence, transitions 0 ↔ 1 ↔ 2 are allowed, but 0 ↔ 2 is not, as it is actually the case
in our CI calculations. Within this model, µ01 = (4w/U)xLL and µ12 = 2xLL, with
xLL = R ϕ2
L(r)xdr being the matrix element calculated in terms of the orbital centered
at the left well ϕL. Therefore, from this approximate model a relation µ01/µ12 = 2w/U
is expected, with a transition probability lower for 0 ↔ 1 than for 1 ↔ 2. The
corresponding resonant frequencies are in the relation ω12/ω01 ≈ 4w2/U 2 ≪ 1. The
dynamics of our system can be thought in terms of this three-levels Hubbard model as
follows: starting form the ground state |0i [eq. (19)], the external electric ﬁeld induces
transitions 0 ↔ 1 increasing the occupation of the ﬁrst excited state, while |2i remains
empty because 0 ↔ 2 is forbidden. After some time, part of the population of |1i
is transferred to |2i due to the large µ12. These processes need to be excited with
frequencies ω01 and ω12. The spectral composition of our optimally designed pulse of
length T shows two important contributions: one at ω01 ≈ 14 THz and other at a low
frequency, which cannot be resolved because is less than 2π/T , but could be related to
ω12. Since our target state |RRi requires to populate both |1i and |2i, the processes
continues until both become evenly populated. The presence, in our CI calculations, of
the state |4i and higher levels (not included in the approximate model) having a non
vanishing dipole moment matrix element µ24, produce some leakage, giving rise to the
population of |4i observed in our calculations (Fig. 6).

To some extent, the eﬀect of the low charge impurities can also be understood from
It can be shown that the eﬀect of the addition of
the approximate Hubbard model.
a one-electron operator to the Hubbard Hamiltonian (such as the Coulomb potential
of the charged impurity or the electric ﬁeld of the controlling laser) is accounted for
by a change in the hopping parameter w → w′ = w + δw, with δw ∼ −Z for the
Coulomb charge one-electron operator. The dipole moment operator X = x1 + x2 has
matrix elements hΨg
Di 6= 0. The relative contribution of
|Ψg
Di increases with w (and therefore with Z) in |0i but decreases in |2i [eqs. (19) and
(21)] while |1i is independent of w. Hence µ01 increases, while µ12 decreases, linearly
with the impurity charge Z. The energy diﬀerences ω01 and ω12 do not change (at
ﬁrst order in Z) because all three energy eigenvalues share the same dependence. In
our CI calculations, the probability of dipole transitions 0 ↔ 1 increases at a lower rate
than the decreasing of the one for transitions 1 ↔ 2 (Fig. 6d). As a consequence, if
the pulse designed for the DQD without impurity, containing frequencies ω01 and ω12,
is applied to the system doped with a charged impurity, the whole processes is slower
and, at the end of the pulse duration, the resulting ﬁnal state have a lower ﬁdelity.

In spite of the usefulness of the approximate Hubbard model for interpreting the
results, one should be warned that the detailed electronic structure of the DQD becomes
more and more relevant as higher values of ﬂuence of the ﬁeld are considered because

of the increasing inﬂuence of the higher energy levels.

The complete pulse resulting from the application of the proposed protocol and the
time evolution of the level occupation of the system with Z = 0.3 is depicted in Fig. 8.
The vertical line at t = 8 ps separates the two two steps of the process, i.e., 8 ps. for
initialization and, then, 10 ps for operation of the qubit. Although in a device running
tasks for information processing, the qubit transition will have to be run many times,
the initialization step would be required just once; thus the whole process is not strongly
aﬀected by the impurity.

5. Conclusions

We have studied the eﬃciency of OCT based pulses suitable to produce transitions
between localized and delocalized states of a double quantum dot device, with or without
unintentional impurities. Those transitions give rise to changes of the electron charge
in the individual dots, which can be detected, thus experimentally realizing a charge
qubit. The resulting fast and high-ﬁdelity tailored pulses are able to operate the qubit
in times of the order of 10 ps, shorter than the decoherence time in clean samples, but
their ﬁdelity deteriorates heavily when even small Coulomb charges are present in the
system. Therefore, we proposed and assessed the performance of applying a two-step
protocol, by ﬁrstly initializing the electronic states in the ground state of the system

without impurities, such that it compensates the changes in the electronic structure
suﬀered by the DQD, introduced by the Coulomb charge. The second pulse operates
the qubit as if it were impurity-free. Since both steps are designed in terms of the real
electronic structure of the charged qubit, we have also analyzed the inﬂuence of the
charge Z on the electronic states of the double quantum dots. We have found that the
complete two-step protocol involves mainly the lowest lying energy levels and remains
fast enough to drive the states to the desired target state with a high ﬁdelity, compatible
with the requirements for its use in information processing tasks.
