(Dated: March 17, 2016)

Using resonant Raman scattering spectroscopy with 25 diﬀerent laser lines, we describe the Raman
scattering spectra of mono- and multi-layers 2H-molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) as well as the
diﬀerent resonances aﬀecting the most pronounced features. For high-energy phonons, both A- and
E- symmetry type phonons present resonances with A and B excitons of MoSe2 together with a
marked increase of intensity when exciting at higher energy, close to the C exciton energy. We
observe symmetry dependent exciton-phonon coupling aﬀecting mainly the low-energy rigid layer
phonon modes. The shear mode for multilayer displays a pronounced resonance with the C exciton
while the breathing mode has an intensity that grows with the excitation laser energy, indicating a
resonance with electronic excitations at energies higher than that of the C exciton.

Layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (MX2) are
today the subject of intense studies because of the pos-
sibility to isolate a single monolayer, a two dimensional
crystal, out of the bulk material1,2. This family of ma-
terials includes semiconducting compounds (MX2 with
M=Mo or W and X= S, Se, or Te). They oﬀer an in-
teresting platform to explore purely two-dimensional ex-
citons, phonons, and to study the interplay between the
spin and valley physics3,4. Monolayers of these mate-
rials can be transferred on adapted substrates for opti-
cal or transport investigations.
In contrast to gapless
graphene, their band gap of 1 − 2 eV allows for the con-
struction of transistors5 and of photodetectors6. Even
though the room temperature electronic mobilities they
exhibit reach only the level of few hundreds cm2.V −1.s−1,
orders of magnitude below what is achieved in conven-
tional III-V or II-VI semiconductors quantum wells, their
ﬂexibility and transparency are extremely appealing for
future electronic and optoelectronic applications. For
instance, they are used as building blocks of van der
Waals heterostructures7–9, which cannot be controlled
without a deep knowledge of the phonon modes and of
the electron-phonon interaction in the individual layers.
It is also worth to point out that the photoluminescence
(PL) of MX2 monolayers arises from tightly bound ex-
citons10,11, with binding energies close to 400 meV, and
hence comparable to those usually observed in molecules
or in carbon nanotubes12,13.

Raman scattering plays an important role in the rapid
development of the ﬁeld of research of 2D crystals as
it provides, for most layered materials, a fast and non-
invasive tool to determine the number of layers of a given
specimen14: When the thickness of a MX2 ﬂake is re-
duced, the energy of some optical phonons changes in a
way that can be traced using standard techniques. Res-
onant Raman scattering is powerful technique to explore
electronic properties of materials. The resonant enhance-
ment of Raman scattering signals when the laser energy
is tuned to particular values corresponding to electronic

excitations of the investigated system, is a well estab-
lished tool to perform, for instance, the spectroscopy of
weakly radiative excitations. This technique has been
applied to MoS2 thin layers, probably the most explored
layered MX2 so far, and to WSe2

15–19.

The Raman spectrum of bulk 2H-MoSe2 has been mea-
sured in 198020, allowing for the identiﬁcation of the main
Raman-active phonon modes of this compound. Since
that time, only few studies reported the Raman spec-
trum of thin layers of this material21–23. Although they
provided the description of the main phonon modes, a
complete characterization of the Raman scattering spec-
trum of thin layers of MoSe2 is still lacking. The phonon
band structure of monolayer MoSe2 has recently been
calculated by ab-initio techniques24, and this compound
appears to be distinct from other member of the MX2
family. All these materials present 6 optical and 3 acous-
tical phonon branches, but, in contrast to the case of
25, according to these calculations,
MoS2, WS2 or WSe2
in MoSe2 the A’1 mode is located between the E’ and E”
modes and is not the highest Raman-active mode at the
Γ point of the phonon band structure. The phonon mode
of E symmetry around 290 cm−1, measured at 632.8 nm,
has a much weaker intensity than the A1 mode23 close to
243 cm−1. The E’ mode is split over the whole phonon
Brillouin zone, with a splitting of ∼ 4 cm−1 at the Γ
point. These two E’ phonons are of longitudinal (LO) and
of transverse character (TO), and their splitting comes
from the polar character of MoSe2.

Resonant studies with a large number of laser lines
spanning from the near infrared to the ultraviolet are sel-
dom done, and this is particularly diﬃcult and absent in
the literature when low energy excitations are involved.
It is such a systematic and comprehensive study that is
being reported here, for a model MX2 material (MoSe2)
from monolayer to multi-layer structures. We present a
resonant Raman scattering investigation of mono- and
multilayer 2H-MoSe2 using 25 diﬀerent laser excitation
lines from 458 nm (2.7 eV) to 825 nm (1.5 eV), which

span the energies of the three diﬀerent excitons A, B
and C, located close to 1.54, 1.74 and 2.61 eV, respec-
tively26, and including both high and low energy vibra-
tions.
In the ﬁrst part, we focus on monolayer MoSe2
(1L-MoSe2), discussing in particular the identiﬁcation of
the main Raman scattering features and their excitation
proﬁles. We then address the case of multilayer MoSe2
(NL-MoSe2 where N is the number of layers) and describe
the phonon modes which are only Raman-active in multi-
27–29,
layers. These modes have been observed in MoTe2
30,31, and we propose here their proper
MoS2
identiﬁcation in MoSe2, based on polarization resolved
measurement and on resonant Raman scattering experi-
ments. We present the excitation proﬁles of the main Ra-
man features, including the low energy shear and breath-
ing modes in the case of 2L-MoSe2, and provide evidence,
for some of these modes, of an increase of the scattering
eﬃciency at energies beyond that of the C exciton.

Raman scattering experiments were performed at room
temperature in the backscattering geometry with a triple-
grating spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen cooled
charge coupled device (CCD) camera. Laser excitation
was provided by a mixed Ar/Kr laser (from 458 to 676
nm) and by a Ti:Sapph laser (from 680 nm to 825 nm).
Laser lines were ﬁltered with a grating used in the Lit-
trow conﬁguration. A 50x objective was used to focus
the excitation laser down to a spot of 2 µm, with optical
power of 0.4 mW. Thin ﬂakes of MoSe2 were ﬁrst ex-
foliated from bulk MoSe2 purchased from HQ graphene
and then deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate with a SiO2
thickness of 90 nm. Flakes composed of 1 to 8 layers
were identiﬁed by their diﬀerent optical contrast contrast
(calibrated with AFM measurements on other ﬂakes) and
then by low energy Raman scattering and photolumines-
cence experiments. Raman scattering spectra were nor-
malized by the integrated intensity of the silicon peak
and by its resonant excitation wavelength dependence32,
and by the eﬀect of interferences in the SiO2 layer33 (see
appendix). The luminescence background in the case of
1L and 2L has been removed from the presented spectra.
In the following, the intensity of each mode is normal-
ized to its maximum value observed in the investigated
excitation energy range. We are interested in the inde-
pendent evolution of the diﬀerent modes and not by their
relative intensities. The vibration patterns of MX2 has
been described in many recent reports34,35. Bulk 2H-
MX2 belongs to the D6h point group, while their odd
and even few layers counterparts represent the D3h and
D3d point groups, respectively. This implies a change
of the symmetry of the phonon modes depending on the
number of layers. In what follows we will use the previ-
ously introduced notation18, indicating the symmetry of
the diﬀerent phonon modes by a double notation corre-
sponding to the odd and even number of layers.

In Fig. 1a-c we present three Raman scattering spectra
of monolayer MoSe2 measured at 465 nm (panel a), at
676 nm (panel b) and at 735 nm (panel c). The scale of
these spectra is set in order to compare the position of the

diﬀerent features and normalized spectra are presented in
Fig. 1d. With a 465 nm excitation, the most prominent
feature is the A’1 mode observed at 242 cm−1 in 1L-
MoSe2. Its intensity is 10 times bigger than the intensity
of all other Raman scattering features. The E’ mode,
predicted to be Raman-active in Ref. [24] is also observed
at 288 cm−1. These are the two main features of the
Raman scattering spectrum of 1L-MoSe2

21–23,36.

A more detailed investigation shows that, similar to
15,37–40 compounds, acoustical phonons also
other MX2
contribute to the Raman scattering spectrum of 1L-
MoSe2 and that depending on the excitation wave-
length, such contribution can be strongly enhanced (see
e.g.
the spectra measured using 676 nm and 735 nm
laser excitations). Because the dispersion of acoustical
phonons close to the M and K points is rather ﬂat24,
the associated density of states is peaked close to this
energy and defect mediated phonon scattering is fa-
vored. We observe the longitudinal acoustical phonon
from the M-K points (LA(M)) at 152 cm−1 and its
ﬁrst overtones (2LA(M), 3LA(M) and 4LA(M)). Next
we see a combination of optical and acoustical phonons
from the M point, namely A’1(M)±LA(M) at 61 and
364 cm−1, respectively, A’1(M)+2LA(M) at 518 cm−1,
and E’(M)+LA(M) as well as E’(M)+2LA(M) at 432 and
584 cm−1, respectively. One can also notice in our ex-
perimental data the TA(M)+ XLA(M) with X= 1 to 3
at 262, 414 and 568 cm−1. These acoustical phonons fea-
tures are observed on freshly exfoliated MoSe2 ﬂakes, and
also, with similar intensity, on ﬂakes produced 6 months
before.

An additional Raman scattering feature appears
at 252 cm−1 on all samples, mono- or multilayers.
Polarization-resolved measurements show that this fea-
ture is of the A-type symmetry, and it follows the same
resonances, discussed in the following, as the main A’1
feature at 242 cm−1. At high excitation energy, we also
observe some traces of the modes E” (Γ) and A”(Γ) at
170 and 354 cm−1, respectively24,25, which are normally
forbidden for mono-layers in back scattering geometry.

When decreasing the excitation energy using 676 nm
or 735 nm excitation (Fig. 1b,c), the Raman scattering
spectrum of 1L-MoSe2 changes drastically: the A’1 fea-
ture at 242 cm−1, which is prominent at higher excita-
tion energy now has an intensity comparable to that of
the acoustical phonon features and of their overtones.
The mode TA(M)+LA(M), at 262 cm−1 and the LA(M)
overtones also become particularly well visible in this ex-
citation energy regime. The E’(Γ) phonon, previously
observed at 289 cm−1 now appears at slightly higher en-
ergy 292 cm−1, which we tentatively interpret, based on
the phonon band structure calculations24, as the selec-
tive excitation, for diﬀerent excitation laser energies, of
the lower-energy TO mode or of the upper-energy LO
mode24. This crossover is presented in more details in
Fig. 2. The lower component of the split E’ mode, promi-
nent for excitation wavelengths below ∼ 500 nm, grad-
ually disappears as the excitation wavelength increases.

Figure 2. Raman scattering spectra of monolayer MoSe2 mea-
sured with 465 nm, 530 nm, 568 nm, 647 nm and 720 nm laser
excitation showing the selective excitation of the two E’ opti-
cal phonons.

E’/Eg feature for low excitation energies. We do not
have a microscopic explanation for this crossover and for
the resonant behavior. Electronic band structure calcula-
tions, together with a phonon mode analysis might help
in understanding this eﬀect. Such analysis are beyond
the scope this experimental paper.

The Raman scattering spectrum of multilayers of
MoSe2 shows some additional features. As can be seen in
Fig. 3a for 1L- to 5L-MoSe2 two additional peaks, marked
by the red boxes, appear at 170 and 354 cm−1 respec-
tively. The energy of these two modes does not depend on
the number of layers. In Fig. 3b, we present two Raman
scattering spectra measured on a 2L-MoSe2 in the co-
and cross-linear polarization conﬁgurations. In the cross-
linear conﬁguration, the A1g mode at 242 cm−1 is sup-
pressed, together with the mode observed at 354 cm−1,
showing that this mode is of A-type symmetry. The fea-
ture observed at 170 cm−1 is not aﬀected by the polar-
ization conﬁguration and exhibits hence E-type symme-
try. These two features observed at 170 cm−1 and at
354 cm−1 are then attributed to the zone center E”/E1g
and A”2/A1g, respectively, and they are not Raman-
active in monolayers (even though they show up as weak
features when using high excitation energies). Similar
Raman scattering results have been recently obtained
31.
on MoS2
These latter two modes are not observed in the MoSe2
monolayer, and, as in the case of MoS2, they only ap-
pear in multilayers for excitation energies close to the
C-exciton energy. The eﬀect have been clearly observed
18 and these authors explained this observation
in MoS2
by the fact that, in contrast to the low-energy A and B

18 and the A”2/A1g was observed in WSe2

Above ∼ 600 nm, the upper component of the split E’
phonon appears at 292 cm−1 with an intensity increasing
with the excitation wavelength. As will be conﬁrmed in
the following, this behavior suggests a preferential cou-
pling of the LO phonon with the A- and B-type excitons,
while the TO phonon can only be observed when exciting
at high-energy, in the C exciton range of energy. Such
an eﬀect, pronounced in 1L-MoSe2, is also observed in
multilayers even though they do not exhibit too strong

excitons whose wave-functions are strongly conﬁned to
individual layers, the C exciton’s wave-function is delo-
calized along the whole structure41,42. As a results, the
C exciton can eﬀectively couple to those phonon modes
which are characteristic of multilayers and a resonance of
the scattered intensity is observed for laser energies close
to the C-exciton energy. On the other hand, features of
this type do not appear at lower excitation energies, cor-
responding to the A and B excitons18. The observation
of these two Raman features can help to quickly discrim-
inate between mono- and multi-layer MoSe2 ﬂakes.

A more detailed knowledge of the number of layers
constituting the sample under investigation from Raman
scattering experiments can be grasped from the obser-
vation of the A’1/A1g feature close to 242 cm−1 (see
Indeed, as already reported22, this peak has
Fig. 3c).
an energy that depends on the number of layers, appears
in the Raman scattering spectrum as a single compo-
nent feature for 1L-MoSe2 and 2L-MoSe2, splits into two
components for 3L-MoSe2 and 4L-MoSe2 and into three

4

components for 5L-MoSe2 and 6L-MoSe2. The split-
ting, which comes from interlayer interactions in multi-
layer materials (N > 2)20,29,43, can be used to determine
the number of layers. Close to 252 cm−1, another Ra-
man scattering feature is observed with an energy that
changes with the number of layer. Even though the
proper origin of this feature is still unknown, its energy
diﬀerence with the A’1/A1g feature can provide an ad-
ditional check for the number of layers of MoSe2 (see
appendix). In NL-MoSe2, the contribution of acoustical
phonons is also observed in the Raman scattering spec-
trum in the form of a rich series of overtones, as already
discussed in the case of the monolayer.

To complete the description of the diﬀerences between
mono- and multilayers, we note that another striking
diﬀerence is seen at low vibrational frequencies, below
50 cm−1. In multilayers, as can be observed in Fig. 3a,
some additional features appear in that range with an
energy that strongly depends on the number of layers.
These modes are the shear and breathing modes of the
multilayer structure, i.e.
rigid vibrations of the whole
layers with respect to each other. The evolution of these
modes with increasing number of layers has recently been
44. One can notice from
discussed in the case of MoSe2
the spectra presented in Fig. 3a that, when measured
with a 476 nm excitation, the intensity of these modes is
comparable with that of the E”/E1g and A”2/A1g modes
discussed previously.

When changing the excitation laser energy, all the Ra-
man scattering features considered so far show particu-
lar resonances. These resonances for one- to four- layer
ﬂakes, are presented in Fig. 4 for the E”/E1g phonon at
170 cm−1 (panel a), the A’1/A1g phonon close to 242
cm−1 (panel b), the E’/Eg phonon close to 290 cm−1
(panel c), for the A”2/A1g phonon at 354 cm−1 (panel d),
and for the 3LA(M) replica (panel d). The E”/E1g and
A”2/A1g Raman modes at 170 cm−1 and at 354 cm−1,
respectively, typical for multilayers, are only observed for
excitation energies above 2.2 eV. They both exhibit a res-
onance close to 2.5 eV. For mono- and multilayers, we ob-
serve a resonance of the LO E’/Eg phonon (∼ 292 cm−1)
with the A and B excitons at 1.6 and 1.8 eV, respectively,
while the TO E’/Eg phonon (∼ 289 cm−1) has an inten-
sity that increases when exciting at higher energy,close
to the C excitons at 2.4 eV. As a results, in our experi-
ments, these two LO and TO phonons cannot be observed
simultaneously. On top of these resonances, the intensity
of the TO E’/Eg mode appears to continuously increase
when increasing the excitation laser energy. In the case of
the monolayer, for which these two features are the most
pronounced, the resonance appears at a slightly higher
excitation energy, close to 2.6 eV.

The main A’1/A1g feature close to 242 cm−1 (Fig. 4b)
is observed for all samples and shows for the 1L-MoSe2
a resonance at high energy close to 2.6 eV, which corre-
sponds to the C-exciton energy26. For higher number of
layers, this high energy resonance appears at an energy
close to 2.4 eV. A second resonance is observed at 1.8 eV

and corresponds to the B exciton. Within the resolu-
tion of our experiment, the energy of the resonance does
not seem to depend on the number of layers. Lowering
further the excitation laser energy, another resonance is
observed. As for the LO E’/Eg feature, this resonance
occurs close to 1.6 eV and its energy strongly changes
with the number of layers. The energies of the A- and
of the C- exciton energies appear to depend on the num-
ber of layers while the energy of the B excitons does not.
Such evolution for the A, B and C excitons as a function
of the number of layers has recently been observed in
45,46. These results, concerning the
WSe2 and in MoSe2
various resonances observed for all the phonon modes of
MoSe2, appear as diﬀerent as compared to the ones re-
ported for MoS2, where the A-type phonon mode shows
a resonance with the high-energy exciton only while the
E-type modes show a resonance with exclusively the low-
energy A and B excitons17. In MoSe2, the A’1/A1g mode
shows clear resonances with all three types of excitons,
while the E’/Eg LO phonon displays a resonance with
the A and B excitons and the E’/Eg TO phonon only
appears at high excitation energy.

Figure 5. a) Normalized intensity of the A1 mode at 242 cm−1
as a function of the excitation laser energy. b) Photolumines-
cence intensity, normalized to the maximum intensity of the
monolayer. Vertical dashed lines indicate the observed max-
ima of Raman intensities (panel a) and of luminescence (panel
b). Note the shift between the two maxima (highlighted with
the vertical arrow, and equal to the energy of the involved
phonon), indicative of an outgoing resonance process.

Some modes, namely the E’/Eg and the A”2/A1g, have
an intensity that, on top of the resonances observed at
the exciton energies, increases strongly when increasing
the excitation laser energy. This second resonance could
be related to the valence band, and especially the band
located ∼ 2 eV below the highest valence band at the
K point13,24,47. In this range of energy, the partial den-
sity of states shows a maximum that could explain the
resonance behavior observed in Raman scattering. This
hypothesis needs to be further clariﬁed on a theoretical
point of view and/or with Raman scattering experiments
performed in the UV range of energy. Finally, in contrast
to the case of optical phonon modes described above, the
LA phonon replicas show a pronounced resonance only
with the low energy A and B modes, and are only weakly
visible when exciting at higher energy. This behavior is
shown in Fig. 4e for the 2L and 4L-MoSe2. Similar to the
15, when using an excitation energy close to
case of MoS2
that of A or B excitons, these acoustical phonon replica
can become the dominant contribution to Raman scat-
tering spectrum of MoSe2 (see spectrum at 676 nm in
Fig. 1 and appendix).

The low-energy resonance of the A’1/A1g mode is pre-
sented in more detail in Fig. 5a for excitation energies
between 1.4 and 1.8 eV. The photoluminescence (PL)
of MoSe2 mono-layers arises from the low-energy A ex-
citon48.
In Fig. 5b, the room-temperature PL spectra
recorded on the same samples are plotted for comparison
with the data displayed in Fig. 5a.

room temperature a marked decrease of the luminescence
intensity together with a small shift of the luminescence
energy, from 1.57 eV for 1L-MoSe2, to 1.54 eV for 2L-
MoSe2, and to 1.52 eV for 3L- and 4L-MoSe2. The origin
of these two eﬀects is still debated. They could originate
(i) from a direct to indirect band gap transition when go-
ing from mono to multilayers, or (ii) reﬂect the diﬀerence
in the relative energies of the A exciton and of the single
particle indirect bandgap due to the change of dielectric
screening and the decrease of the exciton binding energy
for multilayers. The observed resonances for the A’1/A1g
Raman scattering feature are centered at 1.610 ± 0.01,
1.575 ± 0.003, 1.560 ± 0.002 and 1.560 ± 0.002 eV for
1L- to 4L-MoSe2, respectively. We interpret the energy
diﬀerence between the emission of A excitons and the
resonance in the Raman scattering as a signature of an
eﬃcient outgoing resonance. In fact, the maximum inten-
sity of the Raman scattering is observed in this material
when the incoming photon energy is equal to the sum of
the exciton and of the scattered phonon energies.

As already mentioned, layered materials also show low-
energy shear phonon modes, of the E-type symmetry, and
breathing phonon modes, of the A-type symmetry. De-
tailed investigation of these modes in few-layer samples
has recently become more accessible due to the commer-
cial development of volume Bragg grating ﬁlters allow-
ing to easily explore the low-energy range49 of the Ra-
man scattering spectrum, down to 5-10 cm−1. The shear
and breathing modes are today the subject of intense
research in the ﬁeld of MX2. Their Raman shift as a
function of the number of layers and their polarization
selection rules have been described in detail for MoS2,
29,34,35,44. Because of
WSe2, MoSe2, WS2 and in MoTe2
technical diﬃculties, such studies are usually performed
at a single excitation wavelength, and a complete picture

6

of the excitation proﬁle of such low energy modes in MX2
is still lacking. Resonant Raman spectroscopy of such
low-energy modes has been performed in semi-metallic
twisted graphene, allowing to trace the evolution of its
high-energy bands and to quantify the interlayer interac-
tion as a function of the twist angle50.

The use of a triple spectrometer and the access to large
number of laser lines has allowed us to perform such a
detailed resonant study for mono and multilayer MoSe2.
In Fig. 6a, we present Raman scattering spectra of the
shear (S) and breathing (B) modes of 2L-MoSe2 mea-
sured for excitation wavelengths from 454 nm to 647 nm.
They are observed at 21 cm−1 and 34 cm−1, respec-
tively44 and their energies do not change with the ex-
citation wavelength. Fig. 6b illustrates the evolution of
the normalized intensity of these two modes as a func-
tion of the excitation laser energy. As can be seen, they
show rather distinct resonance behaviors. The E-type
symmetry shear mode exhibits a pronounced resonance
close to ∼ 2.4 eV, similar to the resonance observed
for both high-energy A-type modes, which corresponds
to the C exciton energy in 2L-MoSe2. In contrast, the
breathing mode, of the A-type symmetry, does not show
this resonance but its intensity increases with increas-
ing excitation laser energy. At excitation energies below
2.4 eV, the intensity of the breathing mode is nearly not
observable in 2L-MoSe2, grows rapidly at higher ener-
gies, becoming stronger than that of the shear mode and
eventually representing the most pronounced low energy
feature above 2.65 eV. For excitation energies lower than
1.95 eV (647 nm), we could not observe these low-energy
modes mainly because of the strong low-energy scattering
and/or PL when approaching the energies of the A and
B excitons. Similar to the TO E’/Eg at 289 cm−1 and
to the A”2/A1g mode at 354 cm−1, the breathing mode’s
intensity seems to show a resonance with electronic exci-
tations above the energy of the C exciton. For diﬀerent
MX2 materials, depending on the excitation laser and
on the exciton energy structure, very diﬀerent intensity
ratios between the shear and breath modes have been
reported recently19,29,34,35,44. As follows from the study
reported here, these diﬀerences arise from the peculiar
resonance eﬀect aﬀecting diﬀerently the two modes.

To conclude, we have presented a comprehensive Ra-
man scattering study of MoSe2 mono- and multi-layers.
We have shown in this compound the existence of new
Raman modes which are only active in multilayers, and
described their resonances when tuning the excitation
laser energy across the three diﬀerent excitons of this
material. Resonant Raman spectroscopy appears as a
well adapted tool to study a variety of excitons in thin
layers of MX2 and their coupling to optical phonons. Our
experiments conﬁrm the lowering of the A exciton’s en-
ergy when increasing the number of layers and this result
is corroborated by the PL measurements. We also show
symmetry-dependent exciton-phonon coupling, in partic-
ular, we show experimentally that the low-energy shear
mode of a bilayer displays a a pronounced resonance with

other hand, this latter mode, together with the E’/Eg
and A”2/A1g mode have an intensity that grows with
the excitation laser energy, which is a signature of a still
unexplored resonance at higher energy, in the deep UV
range.

I. APPENDIX

A. Photograph of the diﬀerent MoSe2 specimens

Large ﬂakes of MoSe2 mono- and multi-layers have
been produced by mechanical exfoliation of bulk MoSe2.
Flakes were then deposited on a Si/SiO2 substrate with
90 nm of SiO2. The substrate had been patterned with
circular holes of 6 µm diameter, but all the results pre-
sented in the main text have been obtained on supported
regions. The following photograph in Fig. 7 present the
diﬀerent specimens that were used for the reported mea-
surements.

As stated in the main text, MoSe2 mono-layers can

C. Spectra normalization procedure

The normalization of Raman scattering intensities is
crucial for the study of resonance eﬀects. All intensi-
ties presented in the main text are normalized according
to the following procedure: We ﬁrst make a background
correction. This background is most of the case ﬂat but,
when the excitation wavelength is set close to the low en-
ergy excitons of mono or few layer MoSe2, luminescence
signals aﬀect the spectra and are removed but using stan-
dard computer tools. Spectra are then normalized by the
integrated silicon signal at 522 cm−1. The silicon ﬁrst or-
der Raman scattering peak shows a resonance when using
high excitation energies. This eﬀect was studied in detail
in Ref. [32] and has to be taken into account by nor-
malizing the measured signal by the resonance curve of
silicon (which also includes the wavelength dependance
of the Raman scattering process). Finally, the ﬂake is

on top of a SiO2/Si structure which produces optical in-
terferences which have a strong impact on the measured
Raman intensities. As it is shown in the literature17,33,51,
the Raman intensities of the Si and the MoSe2 layers are
proportional to an enhancement factor due to the opti-
cal interference existent in a multi-layered structure given
by:

IM oSe2 = Z d

|Eex(x)Esc(x)|2dx,

(1)

where Eex(x) and Esc(x) are the electrical ﬁeld’s ampli-
tude of the total incident and scattered light respectively,
and d is the thickness of the MoSe2. The enhancement
factor for the Si substrate is17,33

ISi = Z ∞

0

|Fex(x)Fsc(x)|2dx,

(2)

where Fex(x) and Fsc(x) are the electrical ﬁeld ampli-
tude of the total incident and scattered light respectively.
It is important to take into account the wavelength de-

8

 

pendence of the complex refractive index of each ma-
terials to describe the propagation of the incident and
of the scattered light.
In the experiment, the incident
wavelength is given by the exciting laser and the Raman
process deﬁnes the scattered wavelength. To correct the
data, we multiply the experimental spectra by the ratio
17,33 after performing the silicon signal nor-
ISi/IM oSe2
malization described above.

Expression (2) is calculated considering an “unidimen-
sional” problem, where the Si substrate is treated as a
half-inﬁnite media.
In the IR region, where the Si ab-
sorption is small, when using a microscope objective with
a large numerical aperture, we should take the divergence
eﬀect of the focused gaussian beam into account and cal-
culate the integral in a probed volume deﬁned by the
depth of focus. The depth of focus ∆f is deﬁned as the
distance between the points at each side of the beam-
waist where the irradiance of the beam falls to one-half
of its value52. According to Ref. [52] it is given by

∆f =

π(2w0)2

2λ

,

(3)

where w0 is the beam radius at the waist (spot size in
the focus) and λ is the wavelength within the material.
Taking that into account, the upper integral limit(∞)
must be modiﬁed to ∆f /2.

For 1L-MoSe2 sample, Fig. 9a shows the comparison
between the semi-inﬁnite integration and the ∆f /2 cor-
rection for the Si Raman intensity both as a function of
wavelength. Here we assumed a Raman shift of 520 cm−1.
The complex refractive index for Si and SiO2 as a func-
tion of the wavelength were taken from Ref. [53] and
Ref.
[54] respectively and the refractive index of 1L-
MoSe2 was taken from Ref. [26]. Fig. 9b shows the ratio
of the Si and the MoSe2 enhancement factor as a func-
tion of the wavelength for a 1L-MoSe2 and bulk MoSe2
assuming a Raman shift of 290 cm−1. The bulk MoSe2 re-
fractive index was taken from Ref. [33]. As can be seen,
the enhancement factor for 1L-MoSe2 and bulk MoSe2
are similar so that we used the refractive index of the
1L-MoSe2 for the calculations in the multi-layer samples.
