A CLASS OF ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS WITH INTERIOR DEGENERATION

PATRICK GUIDOTTI

Abstract. A class of linear degenerate elliptic equations inspired by nonlinear diﬀusions of
image processing is considered. It is characterized by an interior degeneration of the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient. It is shown that no unique interpretation of the equation is possible. This phenom-
enon is reﬂected in the behavior of numerical schemes for its resolution and points to similar
issues that potentially aﬀect its nonlinear counterpart.

The Perona-Malik equation has attracted a fair amount of interest since its introduction in the
early 1990ies mainly because of an apparent dichotomy between its mathematical ill-posedness
and its eﬃcacy as an image processing tool. In the mathematical literature regularizations and
relaxations of various kinds have be proposed and analyzed; we refer to [7] for an overview. Here
the focus is on the regularization proposed in [8] which replaces the gradient edge detection of
Perona-Malik with one using fractional derivatives. The equation reads

for a given, ﬁxed ǫ ∈ (0, 1] and an unknown curve of periodic functions u(t,·) : B → R on the
normalized unit box (of R2 in applications to image processing). The initial datum u0 is a given
corrupted image that needs to be enhanced. The classical Perona-Malik equation corresponds to
setting ǫ = 0 in (1.1) and is known for its strong edge preservation/sharpening capabilities. This is
related to its well-kown forward-backward nature (see [7] for instance). The distinguishing feature
of (1.1) is the combination of its mathematical forward parabolic character, albeit degenerate, and
its strong edge preserving properties. Latter are due to the fact that characteristic functions of
smooth sets, piecewise constant functions more in general, turn out to be stationary solutions of
(1.1). This was the motivation beyond the introduction of (1.1). A transition between non-trivial
dynamical behavior for piecewise constant initial data has been observed to occur in numerical
experiments as the parameter ǫ crosses the threshold value 1
2 . If it is smaller, such initial data
are preserved, reﬂecting their equilibrium status for (1.1).
If it is larger, however, (numerical)
solutions typically (more on this later) tend to exhibit fast convergence to a uniform state.
In
the context of smooth solutions (to necessarily smooth initial data), this transition from local to
global well-posendess was analytically conﬁrmed in [6], where global existence and convergence to
trivial steady-states are established for smooth enough initial data for a variant of (1.1) in a one-
dimensional setting. This is somewhat unsatisfactory since most interesting (numerical) solutions
of (1.1) are not smooth enough and, while piecewise constant solutions can be viewed as stationary
for the evolution, no weak solvability theory is available for any low regularity class of functions
including them. A signiﬁcant impediment to the development of a comprehensive weak solvability
theory is the (conjectured) non-existence of function spaces containing piecewise constant functions
for which weak solutions can be constructed. In this paper, starting from a modiﬁcation of (1.1)

possesses a unique solution which instantaneously regularizes and eventually converges to a trivial
steady-state. Since piecewise constant functions can also be seen as steady-states, non-uniqueness
ensues. It will furthermore be demonstrated how lack of uniqueness at the continuous level mani-
fests itself in the numerics as a grid-choice phenomenon. Observe that (1.4) with such initial data
is of weakly degenerate type for ǫ > 1
2 . In the
weakly degenerate case, it is possible to show that the degenerate elliptic operator generates an
analytic semigroup on L2. This regularizing evolution can be viewed as the vanishing viscosity
limit for the equation with diﬀusivity δ + aε(u0) for δ > 0. While this is possibly the most natural
interpretation of the degenerate equation, it is not the only one. It can indeed be shown that a
valid alternate interpretation is obtained by using the zeros of aε(u0) to split the equation into
a decoupled system for functions deﬁned on either side of the zero set evolving independently.
The lack of a unique interpretation of the equation is reﬂected in numerical approximations where
diﬀerent discretizations can produce diﬀerent solutions.

2 , while it is of strongly degenerate type for ǫ < 1

Elliptic and parabolic equations with interior degenerations have not been studied extensively
in the literature. The approach taken in this paper is most akin to that utilized by [3] in a
one-dimensional context in that it shows, in particular, generation of an analytic semigroup on
L2. Recently a general framework for linear and nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations has
been developed in [1] by diﬀerent techniques based on the concept of singular manifolds. These
techniques can be adapted to construct one of the possible solutions in a nonlinear context. This
is done in a forthcoming paper [9].

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, linear weakly degenerate equations will
be shown to generate analytic, contraction semigroups. Spectral properties related to compact
embeddings and the validity of a Poincar´e inequality for weakly degenerate equations will be
highlighted.
In Section 3 the one-dimensional case will be considered to show how numerical
implementations can produce the two types of solutions mentioned above. The vanishing viscosity
limit will be considered in section 4 via Γ-convergence.

2. Well-posedness

The focus of this section will be on linear weakly degenerate elliptic problems with diﬀusivity
belonging to a speciﬁc class of functions. Let n = 1, 2 and B = [−1, 1)n be the periodicity box.
Consider bounded periodic functions α : B → [0,∞) which vanish only on a smooth closed curve
Γ ⊂ B and satisfy

α d(x, Γ)σ ≤ α(x) ≤ α d(x, Γ)σ, x ∈ B,

for some 0 < α ≤ α < ∞, σ ∈ [0, 1), and that are otherwise smooth on B \ Γ. The function d(·, Γ)
given by

represents the distance function to the set Γ. The collection of all such functions is denoted by

π. For α ∈ Dσ

σ = 0, the diﬀusivity cannot obviously be required to vanish on Γ and this is a strongly elliptic
equation, while, for σ ∈ (0, 1), it is a so-called weakly degenerate elliptic problem. For this
nomenclature and basic results it is refered to [10], where a weakly degenerate equation of type
(2.1) is characterized in particular by the conditions that

The second condition ensures that the weighted space

As compared to [10], the diﬀusivities considered in this paper satisfy stronger conditions and yield
a variety of additional quantitative properties as detailed later. It is easy to see that

Clearly the form aα is non-negative and symmetric. Next a few properties of the space H1
π,α(B)
are collected which are important for the understanding of the weakly degenerate problem (2.1).
Notice that proofs are mostly given for n = 2 since the one dimensional case is simpler and can be
handled in a perfectly analogous manner.

is said to belong to the Muckenhoupt class A2. It is known from [11] that

0 ≤ α ∈ A2 ⇒ kM ukL2

α(B) ≤ ckukL2

(2.5)

Next take a compactly supported, radial and radially decreasing, non-negative, smooth testfunction
ϕ ∈ D(Rn) with supp(ϕ) ⊂ B and with

ˆB

ϕ(y) dy = 1.

Think of it as periodically extended to the whole space. Deﬁne an associated molliﬁer ϕn in the
usual way

ϕn(x) = n ϕ(nx) and un(x) = ϕn ∗π u(x) := ˆB

ϕn(x − y)u(y) dy, x ∈ Rn.

Then one has that un ∈ Dπ(B) and that

un → u in L2

π(B) as n → ∞.

It is also known (see e.g. [12]) that ϕn ∗π u(x) ≤ M u(x) for x ∈ B and that

for any u ∈ L1

ϕn ∗π u → u almost everywhere as n → ∞,

here.

Proof. Since Γ is assumed to be a smooth, closed curve, it possesses a tubular neighborhood TΛ(Γ)
with coordinates (y, λ) determined by

where νΛ is the unit outward normal to Γ. Then, for any x ∈ TΛ(Γ), it is possible to ﬁnd a unique

pair(cid:0)y(x), λ(x)(cid:1) ∈ Γ × (−Λ, Λ) such that

It follows that any integral with respect to the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure dxdy amounts
to an integral in the new coordinates with respect to the measure dσΓλ (y)dλ, where σΓλ is the line
measure along

Remark 2.7. Notice how a piecewise constant initial datum is instanteneously regularized in spite
of the fact that it is a steady-state of the equation. While the theorem ensures well-posedness in
the speciﬁed classes of functions, the existence of additional solutions is observed also in numerical
discretizations of the equation.

Remark 2.8. While the semigroup is analytic, it does not follow that solutions are C∞. This is
due to the fact that the eigenfunctions are not smooth where the coeﬃcient α vanishes.

3. A Numerical Remark

The non-uniqueness phenomenon highlighted above will be investigated for a spatial semi-
discretization of (2.1) in a one-dimensional setting. The observation extends to the two-dimensional
setting with the appropriate modiﬁcations. Let σ ∈ (0, 1) and take α ∈ Cσ
π(−1, 1) such that
α(x) ∼ |x ∓ 1/2|σ for x ≃ ±1/2 and such that α(x) > 0 for x 6= ±1/2. Then 1/α ∈ L1(B) and α
satisﬁes the conditions of the previous section. Choosing

This shows that both solutions can be obtained numerically and that En

Remark 3.1. Observe, however, that it is more likely (especially in higher dimensions) that a
numerical scheme will deliver the “smooth” solution of the continuous equation rather than the
stationary one (for piecewise constant initial data). This is due to the fact that latter solution can
only be captured if the jumps are on (or close enough) to the grid and Dirac delta functions at the
jump locations discretize to discrete delta functions (read natural basis vectors). This is the case
in the above example when n is even but could not hold, e.g., for centered diﬀerence scheme based
on discretizing the ﬁrst derivative by

That said, the above example is not pathological. Indeed spectral discretizations in combination
with appropriate discrete quadrature rules for the discretization of integrals (duality pairings) also
capture the “singular” rather than the regular solution. This follows again from the fact that
continuous delta functions discretize to discrete delta functions as is proved in [5].

and the solution converges to a trivial steady-state in each subdomain.

π(B) (or, more in general, u0 ∈ H−1

α,π(Ωo)),

In this interpretation, an initial datum that is constant on each of the domains Ωl, l = i, o,
is a stationary solution and won’t be regularized. This means that non-uniqueness (as observed
numerically in the previous section) stems from the fact that there is no natural interpretation of
equation (1.4) and, in fact, system (4.1) is an equally valid formulation.

Remark 4.2. Taking the system point of view, it is possible to recover the interpretation of Section
1 by deﬁning the energy functional Fα on

This means that “continuity” across the interface has to be explicitly enforced.

In spite of the fact that both the regularized problem and the limiting one generate analytic
semigroups, solutions of the ﬁrst do not converge to solutions of the latter in any strong way. This
is due to the loss of regularity in the limit, where eigenfunctions (and more general solutions) are
no longer smooth but merely H¨older continuous (on the degeneration set). In view of Proposition
5.1, however, Γ-convergence proves a useful tool for the purpose. In fact, well-known results for
gradient ﬂows showing that, if a sequence of energies Γ-converges to a limiting energy, so do the
minimizing movements of the corresponding gradient ﬂows, apply and yield the stated result.
Minimizing movements u for a, in this context, convex energy functional E on a Hilbert space H

Lemma 6.2. If n = 1, set u0 = χ[−1/2,1/2] (or the characteristic function of any interval) and,
if n = 2, let u0 = χΩ for a domain Ω ⊂ B with smooth boundary Γ (or a ﬁnite combination
of such characteristic functions of non-intersecting domains). Then, for n = 1, 2, with the same
interpretations as in the previous lemma, one has that

|∇|−ε|∇u0|(x) ∼ d(x, Γ)ε−1 for d(x, Γ) ∼ 0.

Proof. Using the kernel representation given in Lemma 6.1 and the fact that ∂u0 = δ−1/2 − δ1/2
yields that

and where νΓδΓ can be interpreted as a vector measure. Then its total variation measure |νΓδΓ| is

Next ﬁx a point x in the vicinity of Γ. Denote by yx the point on Γ closest to x. Exploiting the
fact that the manifold Γ is compact and has hence bounded geometry, it is seen that

|x − ˜y|2 = |x − yx|2 + |yx − ˜y|2 ∼ r2 + s2,

for ˜y in a small ﬁxed ball BΓ(yx, δ) uniformly in x ∈ Tδ(Γ) for a (without loss of generality) common

spanned by τ (yx) in the local coordinate system given by τ (yx) and ν(yx), the unit tangent and
