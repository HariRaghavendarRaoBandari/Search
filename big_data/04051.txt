Abstract

Many results have been established about determining whether or not an element
evaluates to zero on an irreducible character of a group. In this note it is shown that
if a group G has a normal nilpotent subgroup N , and P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G,
then no irreducible character of G vanishes on N ∩ Z(P ).

Let G be a ﬁnite group and χ ∈ Irr(G), an irreducible character of G. A classical result
of Burnside says if χ is non-linear, that is χ(1) 6= 1, then there is at least one element g
in G such that χ(g) = 0. If one considers conjugacy classes, a natural dual to irreducible
characters, then g being a central element in G implies that |χ(g)| = χ(1) and thus g
does not evaluate to zero on any irreducible character. However, a non-central element
g may also not evaluate to zero on any irreducible character, for example the 3-cycles in
Sym(3). Elements which do not evaluate to zero on any irreducible character of a group are
called non-vanishing. The study of non-vanishing elements was ﬁrst introduced in [INW99],
where the authors showed for soluble groups any non-vanishing element g in a group G must
reduce to a 2-element in G/F (G). In [DNP+10] this result was generalised to any group,
in particular it was shown that if an element g is non-vanishing in G and the order of g is
coprime to 6, then g lies in F (G).

We note that there has been a recent interest in the literature asking about how much
In particular, in
group structure is determined by the vanishing conjugacy class sizes.
[DPS10] and [Bro], the authors have generalised arithmetical results upon conjugacy classes
to vanishing conjugacy classes. Thus the determination of non-vanishing elements would
provide further machinery for this recent topic of research.

The aim of this note is to generalise one of the key results in [INW99], that is [INW99,
Theorem A], which says if a group has a normal Sylow p-subgroup P , then all the elements
in Z(P ) are non-vanishing. A variant of this result was considered in [Miy12], where the
author showed that if a group has a normal elementary abelian p-subgroup A and P is
a Sylow p-subgroup, then the elements in Z(P ) ∩ A are non-vanishing. In particular, we
ﬁrst show that the result of [Miy12] holds if A is a normal abelian subgroup. From this
we deduce the result holds if A is a normal nilpotent subgroup. Note that from this new
result, [INW99, Theorem A] follows by setting A = P .

Theorem. Let G be a ﬁnite group, which contains a non-trivial normal nilpotent subgroup
N and p a prime. Then for P ∈ Sylp(G), the elements in N ∩ Z(P ) are non-vanishing in
G.

First we give the following preliminary result which considers when a sum of roots of

unity is equal to zero.

Lemma. Let Ξ := {ξ1, . . . , ξt} be a set of pn-th roots of unity, for some number n ≥ 1, such
that ξ1 + · · · + ξt = 0. Then the sum can be split into sums of the form ξ + ξpa−1+1 + · · · +
ξ(p−1)pa−1+1, for possibly various numbers 1 ≤ a ≤ n, where ξkpa−1+1 ∈ Ξ for 0 ≤ k ≤ p − 1
and each such subsum equals zero.

Proof. Let ξ be an element in {ξi | 1 ≤ i ≤ t} of maximal order, i.e. ξ is a primitive pa-th
root of unity and ξpa
i = 1 for all i. It is enough to prove that ξ, ξpa−1+1, . . . , ξ(p−1)pa−1+1 ∈ Ξ,
as then

ξ + ξpa−1+1 + · · · + ξ(p−1)pa−1+1 = ξ(1 + ξpa−1

+ · · · + ξ(p−1)pa−1

) = 0

and inductively from Ξ\{ξ, ξpa−1+1, . . . ξ(p−1)pa−1+1} repeat the argument.

Assume ξ1 = ξ, which is a primitive pa-th root of unity, so that each ξi is a power
j=1ξbj = 0 with ξbj ∈ Ξ, where bi ≤ bi+1 ≤ pa and
j=1X bj . As Φpa(X) =

of ξ. Pick r minimal such that Σr
b1 = 1. Then it follows that ξ is a root to the polynomial Σr
1 + X pa−1

+ · · · + X (p−1)pa−1

is the minimal polynomial for ξ it follows that

Σr

j=1X bj = Φpa(X)g(X),

for some polynomial g ∈ Z[X].

For each j, bj > 0, therefore g(X) cannot have a constant term, i.e. g(X) = Xf (X) for
some f ∈ Z[X]. The polynomial f (X) must have a constant term c 6= 0, because b1 = 1.
Thus

Σr

j=1X bj = cXΦpa(X) + X 2Φpa(X)h(X),

for some h ∈ Z[X]. As bj ≤ pa, it follows that 2 + (p − 1)pa−1 + deg(h(X)) ≤ pa. Moreover,
2 ≤ deg(X 2h(X)) ≤ pa−1. If X 2Φpa(X)h(X) has a term of the form X kpa−1+1 then X 2h(X)
must have the term X or X mpa−1+1 for some positive integer m, which is a contradiction.
In particular, cXΦpa(X) has no terms in common with X 2Φpa(X)h(X). Hence XΦpa(X)
occurs as a subsum of Σr

j=1X bj . However as ξΦpa(ξ) = 0 it follows that

Σr

j=1X bj = XΦpa(X).

We can now establish the main result in the case that a group has a normal abelian
subgroup. Note that the proof makes use of the method in [Miy12] with the additional
information about roots of unity in the previous lemma.

Proposition. Let G be a ﬁnite group, which contains a non-trivial normal abelian subgroup
A and p a prime. Then for P ∈ Sylp(G), the elements in A ∩ Z(P ) are non-vanishing in
G.

Proof. Let x ∈ A ∩ Z(P ) such that there exists some χ ∈ Irr(G) for which χ(x) = 0.
By Cliﬀord’s theorem χ ↓A= eΣt
i=1ζ gi such that ζ ∈ Irr(A) and the set {gi} forms a
transversal of I := IG(ζ) in G, for IG(ζ) the inertial subgroup in G of ζ. If χ ↓A (x) = 0,
i=1ζ gi(x) = 0. Thus by the lemma we can split this sum into smaller subsums of p
then Σt
elements (which also equal zero). Let {ξj} denote a set of representatives for the distinct
subsums of p elements as in the above lemma. If kj denotes the multiplicity of ξj, then
Σjkjp = t. Hence it is enough to show that the p-part of t, denoted tp, divides kj as then
tpp divides t which is a contradiction.

The fact that the multiplicity kj is divisible by tp is in the proof of [Miy12, Theorem],

however we shall include details for completeness.

The subgroup P acts on the set of G-conjugates of ζ with the orbit size of ζ g given by

|P : P ∩ I g| = |G : P ∩ I g|p = |G : I g|p|I g : P ∩ I g|p.

Therefore |G : I|p divides the orbit size. As x ∈ Z(P ) it follows that ζ gy(x) = ζ g(x) for all
y ∈ P . Thus the value x evaluates to is constant on each P -orbit. Hence the multiplicity
of ξ in {ζ gi(x)} must be divisible by |G : I|p = tp.

This completes the proof.

From the proposition the main theorem now follows.

Proof of theorem. Let N be a non-trivial normal nilpotent subgroup of a ﬁnite group G
and P a Sylow p-subgroup of G for a prime p. Assume x ∈ N ∩ Z(P ). As N is nilpotent,
Op(N ) is the unique Sylow p-subgroup of N . Thus x ∈ Op(N ) ∩ Z(P ). As Op(N ) is a
normal p-subgroup of G, the group Op(N ) is a subgroup of P . In particular, it follows that
Op(N ) ∩ Z(P ) ≤ Z(Op(N )). Hence x ∈ Z(Op(N )) ∩ Z(P ) and the result follows from the
proposition, as Z(Op(N )) is a normal abelian subgroup of G.

Corollary (1). Let G be a ﬁnite group and F (G) the ﬁtting subgroup of G. Then for p a
prime and P ∈ Sylp(G), the elements in F (G) ∩ Z(P ) are non-vanishing in G.

In [INW99] it is conjectured that for soluble groups, all non-vanishing elements lie in
the Fitting group. This result provides a partical insight into which elements of the Fitting
subgroup would in fact be non-vanishing in a group.

In the proof of the proposition, the importance of A being abelian is that the restricted
character must be a sum of linear characters. It is therefore natural to assume that if such
a restriction was made to characters with degree not divisible by p, a similar argument
should work.
In fact this can be bypassed in a more general setting by using the Ito-
Michler Theorem, which was proven for soluble groups by N. Ito [Itˆo51] and then for any
group by G. Michler [Mic86] using the classiﬁcation of ﬁnite simple groups.

Corollary (2). Let G be a ﬁnite group and N normal in G such that no irreducible char-
acter of N has degree divisible by a prime p. Furthermore, let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of
G. Then the elements in Z(P ) ∩ N are non-vanishing in G.

Proof. As N has no irreducible characters of degree divisible by p, the Ito-Michler theorem
implies that N has a normal Sylow p-subgroup Q which is abelian. Therefore N ∩ Z(P ) =
Q ∩ Z(P ). Moreover, as Q is a normal Sylow p-subgroup of N , Q is normal in G. Hence
Q is a normal abelian subgroup of G. Thus by the theorem, the elements of Q ∩ Z(P ) are
non-vanishing in G.

Finally note that in the above corollary the condition that no irreducible character has
degree divisible by p cannot be removed. In particular, let G be a non-abelian simple group
of Lie type with order divisible by p. Then G has an irreducible character of r-defect zero
for any prime r and hence any non-trivial element in G is vanishing [Isa94, Theorem 8.17].
Thus for G = N the conclusion of the corollary cannot hold.
