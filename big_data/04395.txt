Academic Torrents: Scalable Data Distribution

Henry Z. Lo∗, Joseph Paul Cohen∗

March 15, 2016

1 Introduction

As competitions get more popular, transferring ever-larger data sets becomes
infeasible and costly. For example, downloading the 157.3 GB 2012 ImageNet
data set incurs about $4.33 in bandwidth costs per download. Downloading
the full ImageNet data set takes 33 days. ImageNet has since become popu-
lar beyond the competition, and many papers and models now revolve around
this data set. For sharing such an important resource to the machine learning
community, the sharers of ImageNet must shoulder a large bandwidth burden.
Academic Torrents reduces this burden for disseminating competition data,
and also increases download speeds for end users 1. By augmenting an existing
HTTP server with a peer-to-peer swarm, requests get re-routed to get data from
downloaders. While existing systems slow down with more users, the beneﬁts
of Academic Torrents grow, with noticeable eﬀects even when only one other
person is downloading.

comments data set. Upload calculations are for 100 downloads. Time is based
on 34 MB/s download speed.

2 Case Study

Reddit public comments2 is a 160.68 GB data set (when compressed) of text
currently linked to on Kaggle. Since being shared on Academic Torrents in May
2015, the original seeder has uploaded 366.68 GB, while the entire community
has downloaded 15.43 TB. The upload download ratio is:

U/D = 366.68 GB

/

15.43 TB

= 42.067

Sharer uploaded

Total downloaded

For every byte uploaded, the community matched that contribution 41 times.
In a standard HTTP upload / download system, sharing the same amount of
data would incur the seeder 42.067 times more bandwidth.

This U/D ratio translates to real costs. To the uploader, the Reddit data
set costs $4.42 for each download 3 For the 96 downloads, the associated HTTP
bandwidth would mean $424.32, while the bandwidth used on Academic Tor-
rents reduces the bill to $10.09.

Downloaders also get their data faster. From our university server, we are
currently downloading the entire 1.2 TB ImageNet data at 500 KB/s, resulting
in a 33-day download. On Academic Torrents, we have previously reached
speeds of 34 MB/s; a download at this speed would thus ﬁnish in 9.8 hours.
This download speed is limited only by the bandwidth of the pipe.

Using this data, we cost-project the beneﬁts of Academic Torrents with the
same U/D ratio and speeds that we saw on our previous downloads (Table 1).

3 Future

Academic Torrents is maintained by the pending-nonproﬁt Institute for Repro-
ducible Research. Support for terms of service for data sets was recently added.
Academic Torrents currently indexes 10.12 TB of data, serves 30000 unique vis-
itors a month, and facilitates over 900 GB a day. Future eﬀorts will scale up
the platform and improve its user interface to make it more accessible.
