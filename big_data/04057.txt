ABSTRACT
A prediction of the standard ΛCDM cosmological model, also conﬁrmed by N-body simula-
tions, is that dark matter (DM) halos are teeming with numerous self-bound substructure,
or subhalos. The precise properties of these subhalos represent important probes of the
underlying cosmological model. In this work, we use data from the N-body Via Lactea
II and ELVIS Milky Way-size simulations to learn about the structure of subhalos with
masses 106 − 1011 h−1M(cid:12). Thanks to a superb subhalo statistics, by taking a proﬁle-
independent approach, we study subhalo properties as a function of the distance to the
host halo center and subhalo mass, and provide a set of ﬁts that, including both depen-
dences, accurately describe the subhalo structure. With this at hand, we also investigate
the role of subhalos on the search for DM via its annihilation products. Indeed, previous
work has shown that subhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos
signiﬁcantly. Yet, these works have traditionally assumed that subhalos exhibit similar
structural properties than those of ﬁeld halos of the same mass, while it is well known
from simulations that subhalos are more concentrated. Building upon the results from
our N-body data analysis, we reﬁne the substructure boost model of S´anchez-Conde &
Prada (2014). We ﬁnd boost values that are a factor 2 − 3 higher than previous ones. We
further reﬁne our boost model to include unavoidable tidal stripping eﬀects on the subhalo
population. For ﬁeld halos, this only introduces a moderate (∼ 20% − 30%) suppression
of the boost. Yet, for subhalos like those hosting the dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky
Way, tidal stripping does play a critical role, the total boost for these objects being only
at the level of a few tens of percent in the most optimistic cases. Finally, we provide a
parametrization of the boost factor for ﬁeld halos that can be safely applied over a wide
halo mass range.

1 INTRODUCTION

Small matter density perturbations in the early Universe grow
via gravitational instability giving rise to cold dark matter
(CDM) bound structures known as halos. In the standard
ΛCDM cosmological framework (Ade et al. 2015), structure
formation proceeds hierarchically (see, e.g., Frenk & White
(2012)), with low-mass halos forming ﬁrst and then large-mass
halos resulting from the merging and accretion of those smaller
halos. Yet, not all of the smaller structures are destroyed in
this process and, indeed, the hierarchical nature of CDM struc-
ture formation implies that halos are teeming with self-bound
substructure, namely subhalos, which orbit within the poten-
tial well of a more massive host halo.

The study of the statistical and structural properties of
the subhalo population is of prime importance because sub-
halos represent important probes of the mass accretion his-
tory and dynamics of host halos and thus, ultimately, of the
underlaying cosmological model. For instance, the compari-
son between subhalo results derived from N-body simulations
and observational data has revealed potential issues in our
understanding of galaxy formation, e.g., the missing satellites
problem (Klypin et al. 1999; Moore et al. 999a) and the too-
big-to-fail problem (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2011, 2012; Tollerud
et al. 2014; Garrison-Kimmel et al. 014b). Subhalos may also
play a crucial role for indirect dark matter (DM) searches,
namely, the detection of the annihilation products of DM par-
ticles. One of the most plausible DM candidates is a weakly
interacting massive particle (WIMP), with mass lying from
the GeV to the TeV scale (see, e.g., Bertone et al. (2005)).
WIMPs are assumed to be stable in cosmological time scales
and to annihilate into Standard Model particles. Once small
density perturbations in the early Universe grow via gravita-
tional instability and halos are formed, the density of WIMPs
is orders of magnitude larger than the average matter density
and the annihilations of WIMPs occurring in halos and subha-
los, generate gamma-rays, antimatter and neutrinos. In these
searches, the signal is proportional to the square of the DM
density and hence, the presence of substructure could produce
an enhancement (or boost) over the expected signal from the
smooth distribution of DM in the host halo. Moreover, the
closest of these subhalos might represent by themselves prime
targets for indirect DM detection (Baltz et al. 2000; Tasitsiomi
& Olinto 2002; Koushiappas et al. 2004; Diemand et al. 005b;
Baltz et al. 2007; Pieri et al. 2008; Kuhlen et al. 2008; Buckley
& Hooper 2010; Belikov et al. 2012; Ackermann et al. 2012;
Mirabal et al. 2012; Zechlin & Horns 2012; Berlin & Hooper
2014; Bertoni et al. 2015; Schoonenberg et al. 2016).

Diﬀerent techniques have been proposed and used to learn
about the properties of subhalos. Observationally, most of
them are limited to our Local Group. The most massive sub-
halos host low-luminosity dwarf galaxies, so by studying the
velocity dispersion proﬁles of their stars, the underlying DM
distribution and thus, the subhalo internal structure, could
be inferred (Lokas et al. 2005; Strigari et al. 2007; Martinez
et al. 2009). Moreover, by quantifying the number, velocities
and distances to the host halo centers of these dwarf satel-
lite galaxies, it is possible to infer statistical properties of the
whole subhalo population (Prada et al. 2003; Boylan-Kolchin
et al. 2011). Another way to study smaller or more distant
subhalos is by means of gravitational lensing. The alteration
of the expected surface brightness distribution of a lensed im-

age when a subhalo-size structure is close to this arc, could
help us to shed light on the subhalo mass distribution (Suyu
& Halkola 2010).1 On the other hand, a complementary eﬀect
caused by DM substructure is the production of time delay
perturbations in gravitationally lensed systems, which are free
of the referred degeneracies (Keeton & Moustakas 2009).

Traditionally, N-body cosmological simulations have also
been used to study DM halo substructure. Although the study
of subhalo properties represents a computational challenge due
to the very large dynamic range which is required, during
the last years improved N-body cosmological simulations have
proven to be crucial for understanding the properties of sub-
structure within Milky Way-size systems in a ΛCDM Universe,
as is the case of the Aquarius Project (Springel et al. 2008), Via
Lactea (Diemand et al. 2007a), Via Lactea II (VL-II) (Die-
mand et al. 2008), Exploring the Local Volume in Simulations
(ELVIS) (Garrison-Kimmel et al. 014a) and GHALO (Stadel
et al. 2009). These simulations have revealed in great detail the
existence of a population of subhalos in larger halos, even at
high redshifts. Simulations of larger volumes have also allowed
us to study substructure properties at diﬀerent (higher) mass
scales, as Bolshoi (and BolshoiP) (Klypin et al. 2011), Mul-
tiDark (Prada et al. (2012), P12; Riebe et al. (2013); Klypin
et al. (2016); Rodr´ıguez-Puebla et al. (2016)) and, more re-
cently, Copernicus Complexio (COCO) (Hellwing et al. 2015).
Yet, as expected, all mentioned simulations are limited by the
particle mass resolution and, indeed, are far from resolving
the whole subhalo hierarchy by orders of magnitude in mass.
On the other hand, semi-analytical studies, based on the ex-
tended Press-Schechter formalism (Press & Schechter 1974;
Bond et al. 1991; Sheth et al. 2001), do not share these prob-
lems, although the relevant gravitational physics can only be
treated in an approximate way (Taylor & Babul 2001; Benson
et al. 2002; Ullio et al. 2002; Taﬀoni et al. 2003; Zentner &
Bullock 2003; Pe˜narrubia & Benson 2005; Oguri & Lee 2004;
Taylor & Babul 2005b,a,b; van den Bosch et al. 2005; Zentner
2005; Kuhlen et al. 2008; Gan et al. 2010; Pieri et al. 2011;
Purcell & Zentner 2012).

During the last two decades, N-body cosmological simula-
tions have shown that it is possible to describe the DM density
distribution of halos with a single universal parametrization
(Navarro et al. 1996, 1997; Moore et al. 999b; Klypin et al.
2001; Navarro et al. 2008).2 The DM density proﬁles can be
fully determined with a set of critical parameters. For NFW
proﬁles (Navarro et al. 1996, 1997), for instance, the halo mass
and the so-called halo concentration fully determines the halo
internal structure. In practice, NFW ﬁts to the DM distribu-
tion inside halos as measured in N-body simulations allow us
to infer the value of the halo concentration. The concentration
of ﬁeld halos has been extensively studied in the past and sev-
eral concentration-mass relations, c(M ), have been proposed
in the literature (see, e.g., Bullock et al. (2001); Hennawi et al.
(2007); Neto et al. (2007); Duﬀy et al. (2008); Macci`o et al.
(2008); Mu˜noz Cuartas et al. (2011); Prada et al. (2012); Lud-
low et al. (2014); Diemer & Kravtsov (2014); Correa et al.
(2015)). In contrast, subhalo concentrations remain more un-

1 Although due to degeneracies, measuring its density proﬁle by
only using this technique is not possible (Schneider & Sluse 2013).
2 However, see, e.g., Graham et al. (2006); Hjorth et al. (2015) for
a discussion on the non-universality of DM density proﬁles.

certain. For instance, no functional form has been proposed
for the subhalo concentration-mass relation, csub(msub), up to
now. Some of the reasons have to do with the diﬃculty in
deﬁning and assigning concentrations to subhalos in simula-
tions. As a result, for computing the substructure boost to
the DM annihilation signal, a common practice in the past
has been the use of the concentration derived from ﬁeld ha-
los as the concentration of subhalos of the same mass (see,
e.g., Lavalle et al. (2008); Kuhlen et al. (2008); Charbonnier
et al. (2011); Pinzke et al. (2011); Gao et al. (2012); Nezri
et al. (2012); Anderhalden & Diemand (2013); S´anchez-Conde
& Prada (2014); Ishiyama (2014)). Although this assumption
represents a reasonable ﬁrst order approximation, the current
status of the ﬁeld is calling for a more reﬁned substructure
boost model that relies on more accurate subhalo concentra-
tion values. Indeed, N-body simulations have unequivocally
shown that subhalos exhibit higher inner DM densities and
are on average more concentrated than ﬁeld halos of the same
mass (see, e.g., Ghigna et al. (2000); Bullock et al. (2001);
Ullio et al. (2002); Diemand et al. (2007b, 2008); Diemand &
Moore (2011)).

In this work, we address some of these questions in detail
by making use of public data from the VL-II and ELVIS N-
body cosmological simulations. Altogether, these simulations
allow us to study the subhalo internal properties over several
orders of magnitude in subhalo mass. In addition, thanks to
their superb halo statistics, they make possible a careful study
of subhalo properties as a function of the distance to the host
halo center, r. As a result, we are able to propose an accurate
ﬁt for csub(msub, r), the ﬁrst one of its kind to our knowledge.
We will then use the csub(msub, r) relation derived from the
results of the VL-II and ELVIS simulations to compute and
update the substructure boost to the total annihilation signal.
The work is organized as follows. In section 2 we start
by deﬁning the most useful halo and subhalo quantities and
by brieﬂy describing the N-body cosmological simulation data
sets that we use, i.e., VL-II and ELVIS. Later, in the same
section, we present in detail our analysis of subhalo concen-
trations and provide best ﬁts as a function of radial distance
to the host halo center and of subhalo mass. We also quantify
the associated subhalo-to-subhalo scatter found in the simu-
lations. Section 3 is devoted to the calculation of the boost to
the DM annihilation signal due to subhalos, by means of the
results found in section 2. This new substructure model should
be perceived as a reﬁnement of the one in S´anchez-Conde &
Prada (2014). We also provide accurate ﬁts to the boost. We
conclude in section 4 with a summary of our main results.

2 INFERRING SUBHALO PROPERTIES FROM

N-BODY COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS

2.1 Deﬁnition of halo and subhalo properties
A more formal deﬁnition of the halo concentration is c∆ ≡
Rvir/r−2, i.e., the ratio of the halo virial radius, Rvir, and the
radius r−2 at which the logarithmic slope of the DM density
d log r = −2. The virial radius at redshift z is deﬁned
proﬁle d log ρ
as the radius that encloses a halo mean density ∆ times the
critical (or mean, depending on the chosen convention) den-
sity of the Universe, ρc(z). This standard deﬁnition of halo
concentration, while very useful for the study of the internal

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

structure of well-resolved halos, is directly less suitable for
subhalos for several reasons. On one hand, the virial radius
of subhalos is not well deﬁned. Tidal stripping removes mass
from the outer parts of subhalos and, as a result, subhalos are
truncated at smaller radii compared to ﬁeld halos of the same
mass (Ghigna et al. 1998; Taylor & Babul 2001; Kravtsov et al.
2004; Diemand et al. 2007a,b). The subhalo DM density pro-
ﬁles thus drop very steeply near the edge of the subhalo (see,
e.g., Kazantzidis et al. (2004)). On the other hand, although
the central parts of the subhalo are expected to be unaﬀected
by mass loss (Diemand et al. 2008), the particle resolution
of current simulations does not allow for an accurate descrip-
tion of subhalo density proﬁles in the innermost regions of the
subhalos and of the host halo (see, e.g., the discussion in Die-
mand & Moore (2011)). Therefore, describing the structural
properties of a subhalo is not a trivial task and it becomes
highly desirable to ﬁnd a deﬁnition for the subhalo concen-
tration which is independent of any density proﬁle and of the
particular deﬁnition used for the virial radius.

One such way to characterize the concentration parameter
is to express the mean physical density, ¯ρ, within the radius of
the peak circular velocity Vmax, in units of the critical density
of the Universe at present, ρc, as (Diemand et al. 2007b, 2008;
Springel et al. 2008)

(cid:18) Vmax

H0 Rmax

cV =

¯ρ(Rmax)

(1)

where Rmax is the radius at which Vmax is attained and H0 is
the Hubble constant. Note that, in this way, cV can be directly
obtained independently of the assumed form for the subhalo
DM density proﬁle. At the same time, cV still fully encodes
the essential meaning attached to the traditional concentra-
tion parameter. Moreover, Vmax is less aﬀected by tidal forces
(Kravtsov et al. 2004; Diemand et al. 2007b).

Yet, ﬁnding a relation between c∆ and cV is convenient
in order to facilitate both a better intuition on subhalo con-
centration values and to compute annihilation boost factors
in Sec. 3, and ultimately, for a better comparison with previ-
ous works. This c∆ − cV relation, though, will necessarily rely
on the assumption of a particular functional form for the DM
density proﬁle.

For spherical (untruncated) subhalos, the virial mass, m∆,

at redshift z = 0, is deﬁned as

m∆ =

4π
3

r3
∆ ρc ∆ ,

(2)

where ∆ is the overdensity factor that deﬁnes the halos and r∆
is its virial radius. Note that this mass does not represent the
true subhalo mass since, as mentioned, subhalos suﬀer tidal
forces. However, it is still a good proxy for their concentra-
tion, as tidal mass losses mainly aﬀect the subhalo outskirts
and, indeed, are not expected to change the inner structure
signiﬁcantly (Kazantzidis et al. 2004; Diemand et al. 2008).

For an NFW DM density proﬁle (Navarro et al. 1996,

1997),

ρ(r) =

4 ρs

(r/rs) (1 + r/rs)2 ,

(3)

where rs ≡ r−2 is the scale radius and ρs is density at rs. It
can be shown that the relation between cV and c∆ is given by

cV =

where f (x) = ln(1+x)−x/(1+x). Note that, since for an NFW
proﬁle Vmax occurs at Rmax = 2.163 rs, the relation between
both concentration deﬁnitions just depends on ∆.

Furthermore, it is possible to rewrite the virial mass in

terms of Rmax and Vmax in the following way:

m∆ =

with G the gravitational constant.

Below, we will investigate the dependence of the subhalo
concentration on subhalo (would-be virial) mass and distance
to the host halo center. We will do so for both deﬁnitions
of the concentration, cV and c200, by making use of N-body
simulation data. As for our notation, below we use capital
(small) letters to refer to halos (subhalos) or the index h (no
index) for halos (subhalos) otherwise.

2.2 Description of the data sets

High-resolution N-body cosmological simulations are manda-
tory in order to study subhalo properties in great detail.
Ideally, these simulations should resolve the subhalo inter-
nal structure accurately down to the innermost subhalo re-
gions and should provide excellent subhalo statistics. In our
work, we have considered two N-body cosmological simula-
tions of Milky-Way-size halos: VL-II (Diemand et al. 2008) and
ELVIS (Garrison-Kimmel et al. 014a). In both cases, present-
day (z = 0) halo catalogs are available for public download3
and we use the results for Vmax and Rmax. Note that one
may also study halo substructure properties by making use
of large-scale-structure simulations such as BolshoiP (Klypin
et al. 2011), MultiDark (Prada et al. 2012; Riebe et al. 2013;
Klypin et al. 2016; Rodr´ıguez-Puebla et al. 2016), which in
turn would allow to learn about subhalo properties up to the
largest (sub)halo masses. This is left for future work.

VL-II follows the growth of a Milky Way-size system in a
ΛCDM universe from redshift 104.3 to the present time. The
simulation employs just over one billion particles of mass 4100
M(cid:12) to model the formation of a M =1.93 x 1012 M(cid:12) halo and
its substructure, where the halo and subhalo masses are ob-
tained assuming an overdensity of 200 relative to the mean
matter density of the Universe (or 47.6 with respect to the
critical density of the Universe at z = 0). More than 40000
individual subhalos within the host halo are resolved within
R = 402 kpc. Yet, the abundances and properties of many
of these subhalos are aﬀected by resolution eﬀects and, as a
result, the simulation team provides a reliable subsample of
∼ 9400 subhalos with masses above ∼ 106 M(cid:12). VL-II adopted
the cosmological parameters from the WMAP 3-year data re-
lease.

ELVIS contains 48 Milky-Way-size halos, of which half
are in paired conﬁgurations, similar to the Milky Way and
the Andromeda galaxy. The other half are isolated halos that

are mass-matched to those in the pairs. In addition, high-
resolution simulations of three isolated halos were performed.
All simulations were initialized at redshift z = 125. The mass
resolution for the 48 galaxy-size halos is about 105 M(cid:12), while
the particle mass for the higher resolution set is 2.35 x 104 M(cid:12).
The virial mass of halos and subhalos is deﬁned as the mass
within the radius enclosing 97 times the critical density of the
Universe. The distribution of the virial masses of ﬁeld halos
covers the range (1.0 − 2.85) × 1012 M(cid:12). In addition, ELVIS
resolves over 50000 subhalos with masses above ∼ 106M(cid:12).
There is no statistical correlation among the ﬁeld halos since
they were extracted from independent collisionless simula-
tions. Cosmological parameters were taken from WMAP 7-
year results.

We provide a summary of the most relevant parameters of
both simulations in Tab. 1. Let us note that the fact that Ωm
and σ8 are lower for the WMAP 3-year than for the WMAP
7-year data set, implies that halos assemble later for WMAP
3-year cosmology (see, e.g., Macci`o et al. (2008)). However,
the eﬀect is expected to be small given the relatively close σ8
values of both simulations and, indeed, as we show in the next
section, we observe a very weak dependence of the concen-
tration values on the cosmological parameters, both data sets
being in good agreement with each other within their statis-
tical dispersion. We also note that we present our results for
c∆ in the next section adopting ∆ = 200 as the value for the
overdensity to deﬁne halos and subhalos. This is diﬀerent from
the ∆ value used in each simulation, as described above and in
Tab. 1, which implies that our c∆ values are lower than those
obtained if using the overdensities adopted in the simulations
to deﬁne halos and subhalos. However, by doing so we are able
to merge the results of both simulations and treat them on the
same footing for our purposes.

2.3 Subhalo concentrations

It is well known that subhalos exhibit concentrations that dif-
fer substantially from that of ﬁeld halos of the same mass, the
latter being found to be less concentrated (Ghigna et al. 2000;
Bullock et al. 2001; Moore et al. 999a; Ullio et al. 2002; Die-
mand et al. 2007b, 2008; Diemand & Moore 2011; Pieri et al.
2011; Bartels & Ando 2015). Indeed, subhalos are subject to
tidal forces that remove material from their outskirts, making
them more compact. As a result, during this process Rmax be-
comes smaller and the enclosed mean subhalo density, codiﬁed
in cV (Eq. (1)), increases (Diemand et al. 2007a; Kuhlen et al.
2008; Springel et al. 2008).

In this section, we derive an accurate ﬁt

concentration-mass relation for subhalos using VL-II and
ELVIS simulations data. Moreover, previous work has shown
that the subhalo concentration depends not only on the mass
of the subhalo but also on the distance to the center of its
host halo (Diemand et al. 2008; Pieri et al. 2011). We quan-
tify both dependences and propose a subhalo concentration
parametrization that depends on these two quantities.4

In our analysis of VL-II data, we adopted the restriction
on the subhalo maximum circular velocity applied in Diemand
et al. (2008), i.e., only subhalos with Vmax > 3 km/s are in-
cluded to avoid resolution issues in the determination of cV.
A similar concern was addressed for ELVIS in the following
way: for the three high-resolution halos, only subhalos with
Vmax > 5 km/s were considered, whereas all subhalos in the
other 48 host halos were used (Vmax > 8 km/s).

For both simulations, we implemented three radial bins
within the virial radius of the host halo, R∆, as well as a cal-
ibration bin beyond the halo boundary. The innermost radial
bin contains subhalos at a distance Rsub from the host halo
center, xsub ≡ Rsub/R∆ < 0.1 (bin I), while the second radial
bin is deﬁned as 0.1 < xsub < 0.3 (bin II), and the third bin
contains subhalos within 0.3 < xsub < 1 (bin III). In addition,
a calibration bin has been included beyond R∆ to estimate
ﬁeld halo concentrations and to compare those with subhalo
concentrations. The calibration bin contains halos at distances
to the host halo center up to 1.5 R∆. In order to remove from
our calibration bin any possible halo that was inside R∆ in
the past (and thus was a subhalo), we only consider struc-
tures such that the maximum circular velocity achieved over
its entire existence falls within the 5% of the velocity at z = 0
(S´anchez-Conde & Prada 2014). Then, for each radial bin, we
have grouped subhalos in bins of Vmax and have obtained the
medians of cV. Diﬀerent bin sizes were chosen to cover the
entire Vmax range with a similar number of subhalos per bin.
In the top-left panels of Figs. 1 and 2, we show the median
cV(Vmax) values and 1σ errors found for VL-II and ELVIS,
respectively.
The same analysis in radial bins was performed for c200,
which was found by applying the cV−c200 relation of Eq.(4) to
the cV(Vmax) values found for every subhalo in the simulations.
In this case, the medians were obtained considering several
mass bins. The top-right panels of Figs. 1 and 2 show the
median c200(m200) values and 1σ errors for VL-II and ELVIS,
respectively, as well as the c200(m200) relation for ﬁeld halos
derived by Prada et al. (2012) from the analysis of the Bolshoi
and MultiDark simulations. In the top panels, we also depict
the results of our ﬁts (cf. Eqs. (6)-(8)).

It is also interesting to explicitly show the radial depen-
dence of the subhalo concentration, which is very similar for
all subhalo masses. The bottom panels of Figs. 1 and 2 de-
pict, for VL-II and ELVIS, respectively, the medians and 1σ
errors for cV and c200 as a function of the distance from
the center of the host halo in units of R∆, both for sub-
halos within R∆ and for the halos in the calibration bin,

4 Other possible dependences, such as the one with the host halo
mass (Dooley et al. 2014; Hellwing et al. 2015), is left for future
work. It is not possible to investigate this dependence with our
current data sets since all our host halos have comparable masses,
of the order of 1012 M(cid:12).

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

(xsub > 1).5 These bottom panels cover the entire range of
each simulation, m200 ∼ (106 − 109) h−1M(cid:12) in VL-II and
m200 ∼ (107 − 1011) h−1M(cid:12) in ELVIS.

As can be seen from Figs. 1 and 2, the median subhalo
concentration increases towards the center of the host halo and
is signiﬁcantly larger than that of ﬁeld halos, in good agree-
ment with Diemand et al. (2007b, 2008). More precisely, we
ﬁnd that c200 subhalo values can be almost a factor 3 larger
than those of ﬁeld halos of the same mass (for the innermost
radial bin and the less massive subhalos in VL-II), and it is
typically between a factor ∼ 1.5−2 (its exact number depend-
ing on the subhalo mass and distance to the host halo center).
For ELVIS, the ratio between subhalo and halo c200 values is
typically lower compared to VL-II for the same subhalo mass
and distance to the host halo center and, indeed, never reaches
a factor 2. In terms of cV, these subhalo-to-halo concentration
ratios are between a factor ∼ 2− 14 and ∼ 2− 5 for VL-II and
ELVIS, respectively, in the Vmax range where they overlap, i.e.,
Vmax ∼ (6 − 20) km/s.

For the sake of comparison, in the top panel of Fig. 3, we
show the median cV(Vmax) relation and the 1σ errors found
from the results of the VL-II and ELVIS simulations together.
They cover the range Vmax ∼ (3−100) km/s. Likewise, the me-
dian c200(m200) relation and the 1σ errors for both simulations
are also shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 3. Altogether, they
cover the subhalo mass range m200 ∼ (106 − 1011) h−1M(cid:12). It
can be seen that there is an excellent agreement between the
results from the VL-II and ELVIS data within errors.

We now provide parametrizations for the median subhalo
c200(m200) and cV(Vmax) relations, based on the results ob-
tained from both VL-II and ELVIS. In order to reduce the
uncertainties when extrapolating outside the range probed by
these simulations, we also use the results for more massive
halos obtained from the BolshoiP simulation (Klypin et al.
2011) and those for microhalos obtained by Ishiyama (2014).
Formally, the way we add these halos in our subhalo ﬁt is by
assuming the subhalo concentration at xsub = 1 to be equal to
the concentration of halos of the same mass. All these points
from the simulations, as well as our ﬁts are shown in both
panels of Fig. 3.

For the case of the median subhalo concentration-mass

relation, c200(m200, xsub), we get6

This parametrization agrees well with expectations for ﬁeld
halos beyond R∆ and, in particular, with P12. We note again
that it implicitly assumes an NFW density proﬁle for subhalos,
following the discussion in Sec. 2.1.

In the bottom panel of Fig. 3, we show the results of our
ﬁts together with the median concentration values from both

In order to compute the boost factor in Sec. 3 we also
need to have the concentration for the ﬁeld halos. In the case

mation for subhalos. Nevertheless, as we discussed above, the
concentration in the calibration bin agrees very well with the
concentration of ﬁeld halos, so we use these results along with

2.4 Scatter of the subhalo concentration

proposed to be the source of this larger value of the scatter
for subhalos (Bullock et al. 2001).

Due to the stochastic nature of structure formation in ΛCDM
cosmology, an intrinsic, irreducible scatter is expected on the
concentration of DM halos of the same mass (Jing 2000; Bul-
lock et al. 2001; Macci`o et al. 2007; Neto et al. 2007; Macci`o
et al. 2008; Dutton & Macci`o 2014), which mainly reﬂects their
slightly diﬀerent formation epochs (Wechsler et al. 2002). The
size of this halo-to-halo scatter is an important property of the
underlying cosmological model that, ideally, could be used as
an additional test for the model itself. In simulations, the mea-
surement of the scatter of the halo concentration is also subject
to other non-intrinsic eﬀects that are expected to enlarge it,
such as Poisson noise due to the limited number of halos avail-
able (especially close to the high-mass end of the halo mass
range proved by the simulation, where halos are more scarce)
and poor resolution to properly resolve the internal structure
of the smallest halos and thus to derive their concentrations,
e.g., (Bullock et al. 2001).

For the case of subhalos, the intrinsic subhalo-to-subhalo
scatter has been claimed to be larger than the halo-to-halo
scatter in ﬁeld halos. A more complex formation history and
other physical phenomena not present or negligible in the case
of distinct halos, such as interactions or stripping, has been

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

Here, we investigate the scatter of the subhalo concentra-
tions in both VL-II and ELVIS, for the three diﬀerent radial
bins we have considered. In order to do so, we also group the
data in several mass bins. As for the case of ﬁeld halos, we
consider a log-normal distribution (Jing 2000):7

where σlog10 c200 is the scatter and log10 c200,0 is the median,
which is what we have obtained and discussed in the previous
subsection.

The results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, where we depict
the probability distributions of log10 c200 for diﬀerent mass in-
tervals in each of the radial bins considered, for VL-II and
ELVIS, respectively,. In each of the panels we indicate the
mass and radial bin we consider, and indicate the scatter of
the subhalo concentration parameter found in that bin. As we
can see, the scatter does not depend on the subhalo position

within the host halo and only a very weak dependence with the
mass, not statistically signiﬁcant, is observed in VL-II (Fig. 4),
which is not observed in ELVIS (Fig. 5). We obtain a typical
subhalo-to-subhalo scatter of σlog10 c200 = 0.13 for VL-II and
σlog10 c200 = 0.11 for ELVIS. Interestingly, this is comparable
to what it has been found for ﬁeld halos in previous stud-
ies (Macci`o et al. 2007; Neto et al. 2007; Macci`o et al. 2008;
Dutton & Macci`o 2014), and seems to contradicts the idea
of subhalos exhibiting a larger scatter than ﬁeld halos. The
reasons for such a result and its implications deserve further
study, which will be done elsewhere. Note as well, that the
found values probably represent a conservative, upper limit
estimate of the intrinsic scatter for subhalos in these simula-
tions, since we did not model and subtract any of the other
possible sources of (spurious, non physical) scatter in the data
that were mentioned above.

3 HALO SUBSTRUCTURE BOOST FACTOR

FOR DARK MATTER ANNIHILATION

3.1 Context

One of the most active lines of research in DM physics is that
of indirect searches of the DM annihilation products (gamma-
rays, neutrinos and antimatter) in diﬀerent astrophysical re-
gions (Conrad et al. 2015). The ﬂux of this potential DM signal

is proportional to the square of the DM density and thus, re-
gions where the DM density is higher are, in principle, the
most promising targets.

Halo substructure is expected to play a relevant role on
this search. On one hand, some of the closest subhalos may
represent good targets by themselves (Baltz et al. 2000; Ta-
sitsiomi & Olinto 2002; Koushiappas et al. 2004; Diemand
et al. 005b; Baltz et al. 2007; Pieri et al. 2008; Kuhlen et al.
2008; Buckley & Hooper 2010; Belikov et al. 2012; Acker-
mann et al. 2012; Mirabal et al. 2012; Zechlin & Horns 2012;
Berlin & Hooper 2014; Bertoni et al. 2015; Schoonenberg et al.
2016). On the other hand, hierarchical structure formation in
the ΛCDM paradigm implies that larger halos are teeming
with smaller subhalos and this clumpy distribution is expected
to signiﬁcantly boost the DM annihilation signal (Bergstrom
et al. 1999; Calc´aneo-Rold´an & Moore 2000; Aloisio et al. 2004;
Stoehr et al. 2003; Koushiappas et al. 2004; Lavalle et al. 2008;
Kuhlen et al. 2008; Charbonnier et al. 2011; S´anchez-Conde
et al. 2011; Pinzke et al. 2011; Gao et al. 2012; Nezri et al.
2012; Anderhalden & Diemand 2013; Zavala & Afshordi 2014;
S´anchez-Conde & Prada 2014; Ishiyama 2014; Zavala & Af-
shordi 2016). In this section, we quantify the latter and discuss
about the implications a precise determination of the internal
properties of subhalos has for indirect DM searches.

During the last decade, numerous eﬀorts have being de-
voted to estimate the extent of this DM annihilation ﬂux en-

hancement due to the presence of halo substructure. Several
analytical approaches based on the extended Press-Schechter
theory have addressed the properties of the subhalo population
in larger halos (see, e.g., Pieri et al. (2008); Giocoli et al. (008a,
2009); Pieri et al. (2009)) and used results from early N-body
cosmological simulations about the distribution of subhalos
in host halos (Diemand et al. 005b,a) to estimate the impact
on gamma-ray searches. Also, more reﬁned simulations in the
past years have allowed us to better characterize the popu-
lation and the structure of DM subhalos (Kuhlen et al. 2008;
Springel et al. 2008; Diemand et al. 2008; Hellwing et al. 2015;
Rodr´ıguez-Puebla et al. 2016) and diﬀerent algorithms have
been proposed in order to identify small structures within sim-
ulated host halos (Ghigna et al. 2000; Weller et al. 2005; Shaw
et al. 2006; Springel et al. 2001; Gill et al. 004a,b; Tormen &
Moscardini 2004; Giocoli et al. 008b, 2010; Han et al. 2012;
Behroozi et al. 2013). However, the vast majority of this sim-
ulation work has been done for galaxy- and cluster-sized DM
halos and, indeed, although a few simulations of microhalos
are available (Diemand et al. 005b; Anderhalden & Diemand
2013; Ishiyama et al. 2013; Ishiyama 2014), simulating sub-
structure down to the smallest predicted halo masses and up
to the present time remains very challenging. Yet, in order to
estimate the boost factor due to DM annihilations, the contri-
bution from the smallest halos needs to be included. The mini-
mum halo mass depends on the free-streaming of DM particles
from high to low density regions (Zybin et al. 1999; Hofmann
et al. 2001; Berezinsky et al. 2003; Green et al. 2005) and on
the eﬀect of acoustic oscillations (Loeb & Zaldarriaga 2005;
Bertschinger 2006). These processes depend on the particle
physics and cosmological models (Profumo et al. 2006; Bring-
mann & Hofmann 2007; Bringmann 2009; van den Aarssen
et al. 2012; Cornell & Profumo 2012; Gondolo et al. 2012;
Cornell et al. 2013; Shoemaker 2013; Diamanti et al. 2015)
and hence, the minimum mass is very uncertain,8 with possi-
ble values within Mmin = 10−12 − 10−4M(cid:12). In what follows,
we set it to Mmin = 10−6 M(cid:12).

The luminosity from DM annihilations in a halo or sub-
halo scales as the third power of the concentration. Thus,
the substructure boost is very sensitive to the way the sub-
halos’ internal structure is modeled. Moreover, since smaller
(sub)halos possess larger concentrations, and are much more
numerous, they are expected to dominate in the computation
of the boost. However, as mentioned above, there is a lack of
simulations at small halo scales (see, e.g., the right panel of
Fig. 1 in S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014)) so only extrapola-
tions over many orders of magnitude in halo mass are pos-
sible.9 Some works have simply extrapolated the power-law

8 In the case of subhalos, additional violent processes might be also
at work during their accretion and merging into larger halos that
could signiﬁcantly alter the subhalo survival probability and set, in
practice, a minimum subhalo mass at present time diﬀerent to that
of host halos (see, e.g., Zhao et al. (2007); Berezinsky et al. (2006);
Goerdt et al. (2007)).
9 We note that the microhalo concentration results by Ishiyama
(2014), although outstanding and extremely important in this con-
text, were obtained at very high redshifts, so extrapolations of such
concentrations down to the present time were performed in Fig. 1 of
S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014). Thus, strictly speaking, we still lack
simulations that track the formation and evolution of the smallest
halos all the way down to z = 0.

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

behavior of the concentration observed above the simulation
resolution limit all the way down to the minimum halo mass.
However, these power-law extrapolations to low masses, which
tend to predict very large boost factors (Pinzke et al. 2011;
Gao et al. 2012), are at odds with recent results on microhalo
simulations (Ishiyama 2014) and are not expected either in
the ΛCDM cosmological model (Prada et al. 2012; S´anchez-
Conde & Prada 2014). Indeed, a ﬂattening of the concentra-
tion towards low halo masses is naturally expected in ΛCDM:
halo concentration is set by the halo formation time, which is
nearly the same for a broad range of halo masses in the low-
mass regime as a consequence of the power spectrum of matter
ﬂuctuations. Therefore, the natal concentrations of these small
halos are also expected to be nearly the same, and so they will
be at the current epoch. When taking into account the correct
behavior of the concentration at small halo masses, moderate
values of the substructure boost factor are found (Ishiyama
2014; S´anchez-Conde & Prada 2014).

3.2 Computation of the boost

Previous work has traditionally computed the substructure
boost to the DM annihilation signal by assuming the concen-
tration of subhalos to be the same as the one of ﬁeld halos of
the same mass. This represents a fair ﬁrst order approxima-
tion but, as we showed in the previous section, the subhalo
concentrations can diﬀer substantially from that of ﬁeld ha-
los. Here, we recompute the boost factor taking advantage of
that gained from our studies of subhalo internal properties. We
note that, in principle, the self-similarity of halo hierarchy im-
plies that one should consider several levels of substructure in
the calculation of the boost. Nevertheless, as has been shown
(Strigari et al. 2007; Martinez et al. 2009; S´anchez-Conde &
Prada 2014), only counting down to the second level (i.e., sub-
substructure) is necessary in practice.

The substructure boost factor, B(M ), is given by (Strigari

where in the last step we have assumed an NFW proﬁle and
for halos, we use the parametrization for the concentration
parameter from Prada et al. (2012) using the ﬁt obtained in
S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014).
With this at hand, the luminosity of a subhalo of mass m
at a distance Rsub from the center of the host halo, L(m, xsub),
is deﬁned as
L(m, xsub) = [1 + B(m, xsub)]Lsmooth(m, xsub) .
(12)
where now Lsmooth(m, xsub) is the luminosity for the smooth
distribution of the given subhalo and B(m, xsub) is the boost
factor due to the next level of substructure. The luminosity
of a subhalo (sub-subhalo) is given by the same functional
form as that of a ﬁeld halo, but including the dependence of
the concentration parameter on the position of the subhalo
(sub-subhalo) inside the host halo (subhalo).

In addition to the mentioned dependences, we note that
subhalos are not homogeneously distributed within the host
halo (Springel et al. 2008; Hellwing et al. 2015; Rodr´ıguez-
Puebla et al. 2016). However, we have checked that the precise
spatial distribution of subhalos inside halos has only a small
impact on our results (below 10%). Therefore, for the sake
of comparison with previous works, we do not include this
dependence here and postpone its discussion to future work.
By assuming that the subhalo mass function does not change
within the halo, we can write the boost factor as

where dN (m)/dm is the subhalo mass function for a halo of

mass M , dN (m)/dm = A/M (m/M )
factor is equal to A = 0.012 for a slope of the subhalo mass
function α = 2 and to A = 0.03 for α = 1.9 (S´anchez-Conde
& Prada 2014), and was chosen so that the mass in the re-
solved substructure amounts to about 10% of the total mass
of the halo,11 as found in recent simulations (Diemand et al.
2007b; Springel et al. 2008). Note that, as done in most of
previous works,12 we have not subtracted the subhalo mass
fraction from the smooth halo contribution, so in principle,
this leads to a slight overestimate of the smooth halo luminos-
ity, and hence, to a slight underestimate of the boost factor.
This is expected to be a small correction, though, since it ap-
plies mainly to the outer regions of the halo where the subhalos
represent a larger mass fraction and the smooth contribution
is much smaller and subdominant with respect to the contri-
bution from substructure (Palomares-Ruiz & Siegal-Gaskins
2010; S´anchez-Conde et al. 2011).

In the case of an NFW proﬁle, as the one we are using,
the luminosity from the smooth DM distribution of a ﬁeld
halo can also be expressed in terms of the maximum circular
velocity, V h

11 Extrapolating the subhalo mass function down to m/M =

total mass of the halo for α = 2 (α = 1.9).
12 See, e.g., Pieri et al. (2011) for one of the few exceptions.

Figure 6. Halo substructure boost to the DM annihilation signal as
a function of the host halo mass. We have used our c200(m200, xsub)
parametrization in Eq. (6) and adopted Mmin = 10−6 M(cid:12). We
present results for two values of the slope of the subhalo mass
function, α = 1.9 (lower, light red lines) and α = 2 (black lines).
We also show the boost obtained with the DM proﬁle-independent
deﬁnition of cV (green line), for which we have used our ﬁt for
cV(Vmax, xsub) in Eq. (7), and (Vmax)min = 10−3.5 km/s. Notably,
the cV result lies within the results found for c200 and the two slopes
of the subhalo mass function considered. Thin lines correspond to
results obtained assuming subhalos and sub-subhalos are not trun-
cated by tidal forces, while thick lines represent the more realistic
case, in which subhalos and sub-subhalos have been tidally-stripped
(see text). The dashed lines correspond to the results obtained in
S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014) when assuming that both halos and
subhalos of the same mass have the same concentration values.

and, in a similar way, by including the radial dependence of
the concentration of subhalos, one can obtain the subhalo lu-
minosity function, L(Vmax, xsub).

In this case, the boost factor for a ﬁeld halo with maxi-
max (analogously to Eq. (13)), can be

We depict the boost factor for ﬁeld halos as a function of the
halo mass and adopt Mmin = 10−6 M(cid:12) or, equivalently for an
NFW proﬁle, (Vmax)min = 10−3.5 km/s (thin solid lines). We
show the results for both cV (green line) and c200 (in this case,
for two values of the slope of the subhalo mass function, α = 2
and α = 1.9 with black and red lines, respectively). Both re-
sults are in good agreement, with the boost factor obtained
from cV lying within the boost factors obtained from c200 for
the two diﬀerent slopes of the subhalo mass functions consid-
ered. The results obtained in S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014)
are also shown (dashed lines). As done in this latter work and
discussed above, we are including only the two ﬁrst levels of
substructure, namely subhalos and sub-subhalos, as the con-
tribution of the third substructure level was found to be al-
ways less than 6%. Yet, we note that the second level (namely
B(m, xsub) in our notation) can contribute up to ∼ 40% in
some cases. As can be seen from Fig. 6, we obtain a total
boost which is a factor of 2 − 3 larger than that obtained
in S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014), where, we recall, the au-
thors assumed that halos, subhalos and sub-subhalos of the
same mass have the same concentrations. Interestingly, our
results also agree well with those recently found by Bartels
& Ando (2015) by means of a semi-analytical model for the
boost based on mass-accretion histories and subhalo accretion
rates. Similar boost values have also been reported in Zavala
& Afshordi (2016), where authors invoked the universality of
DM clustering in phase space within subhalos across a wide
range of host halo masses (Zavala & Afshordi 2014) to predict
DM annihilation signals.

We caution that, in our work and in S´anchez-Conde &
Prada (2014), an NFW DM density proﬁle is always assumed
for all virialized structures. Nevertheless, it has been recently
shown that subhalos and, very especially, microhalos with
masses close to Mmin = 10−6 M(cid:12) seem to exhibit DM den-
sity proﬁles which are cuspier than NFW in the innermost
regions (Diemand et al. 2008; Ishiyama 2014). Thus, their
concentrations do not correspond to the NFW concentration
values discussed and adopted throughout this paper. Fortu-
nately, it is possible to convert from one to another (Ricotti
2003; Anderhalden & Diemand 2013) and to perform a one-to-
one comparison among them. The result of adopting subhalo
concentrations that are corrected by the mentioned eﬀect is a
moderate increase of the boost factor, up to ∼ 30% (Ander-
halden & Diemand 2013; Ishiyama 2014).

Figure 7. Example of subhalo substructure boost to the DM anni-
hilation signal (the one expected, e.g., for dwarf satellite galaxies)

inside a host halo with mass M200 = 1012 M(cid:12) and located at a
distance of 80 kpc from the host halo center. This is approximately
the case of Draco, one of the Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites
(mDraco ∼ ×108 M(cid:12) (Lokas et al. 2005)). We show results ob-
tained assuming subhalos and sub-subhalos are not truncated (or,
in some cases, destroyed) by tidal forces (thin lines), and assuming
subhalos and sub-subhalos are tidally stripped (more realistic case;
thick lines). We have used our c200(m200, xsub) parametrization of
Eq. (6) and adopted Mmin = 10−6 M(cid:12). We also present results for
two values of the slope of the subhalo mass function, α = 1.9 (light
red lines) and α = 2 (black lines). See text for further discussion.

3.3 Eﬀect of tidal stripping on the boost

So far in the calculation of the boost factor, we have not con-
sidered the fact that subhalos suﬀer from tidal forces within
their host halos and thus, that they are expected to be trun-
cated at some radius rt < r200. As already discussed above,
this also implies that m200 is not the true mass of the subhalo
(which was nevertheless assumed to be such in the calculation
of the boost factor in Sec. 3.2, Eqs. (13) and (15)). Therefore,
a more precise value of the boost can be derived if the actual
subhalo mass m, obtained by integrating the subhalo density
distribution up to rt, was adopted instead. In a similar way,
the subhalo luminosity must be truncated at rt instead of r200,

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–??

This is the only modiﬁcation one has to include in the cal-
culation of the boost up to the ﬁrst level of substructures.
However, to compute the boost factor of subhalos (i.e., up to
the second level of halo substructure), in addition to intro-
ducing the analogous modiﬁcation in the calculation of the
sub-subhalo luminosity, the variable xsub−sub ≡ rsub/r200 (the
equivalent to xsub for sub-subhalos) must be substituted by
rsub/rt, where rsub is the distance of the sub-subhalos to the
center of the host subhalo. Moreover, we assume that tidal
forces do not modify the subhalo and sub-subhalo mass func-
tions per unit volume. This means that the number of sub-
subhalos is reduced and therefore, the boost for subhalos.

(17)

where m is the true mass of the truncated subhalo (with radius
rt) located at a distance Rsub from the host halo center and
M (< Rsub) is the enclosed mass of the host halo out to that
distance (and analogously for sub-subhalos). We have checked
that this mass, m, is on average very similar to the actual
subhalo mass found in simulations (see also, e.g., Fig. 15 of
Springel et al. (2008)).

The eﬀect of tidal mass losses on the boost factor for ha-
los is also shown in Fig. 6. As the subhalo luminosities are
mainly dominated by the annihilations occurring in the in-
nermost regions of subhalos, and these central regions are not
signiﬁcantly altered by tidal forces (Kazantzidis et al. 2004;
Diemand et al. 2007b), the impact of tidal stripping on the
boost factor is expected to be moderate. Indeed, we ﬁnd a sup-
pression of about 20%− 30%, which mainly aﬀects the second
level of iteration. As mentioned above, tidal interactions do
reduce signiﬁcantly the number of sub-subhalos which are left
inside a subhalo, thus, reducing the individual subhalo boost
(i.e., the one that would be applicable to, e.g., dwarf galaxies
satellites of the Milky Way).

We provide an example of the latter eﬀect in Fig. 7, which
shows the subhalo boost factor as a function of subhalo mass
calculated with (thick lines) and without (thin lines) tidal
stripping, for the particular case of subhalos inside a host
halo with mass M = 1012 M(cid:12), and located at a distance of
Rsub = 80 kpc (xsub = 0.39) from the host halo center. This
approximately corresponds to the case of the Draco dwarf
spheroidal galaxy, which has a mass of the order of 108 M(cid:12)
(Lokas et al. 2005). For this galactocentric distance, and with
very little dependence on the subhalo mass, the suppression of
the subhalo boost factor is very signiﬁcant, about 95%, with
respect to the case when tidal forces are not taken into ac-
count. Thus, we conclude that for the vast majority of dwarf
galaxies in the Milky Way, the eﬀect of substructure on the
expected annihilation signal is probably at the level of a few
tens of percent in the most optimistic cases, i.e., the largest
subhalos and α = 2. We note that this result is also in line
with that obtained by following the semi-analytical approach
of Bartels & Ando (2015) for these same objects.

Finally, following S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014), we also
provide a parametrization of the boost factor values found for
ﬁeld halos (cf. Fig. 6). We do so only for the most realis-
tic scenario in which subhalos (and sub-subhalos) are aﬀected
by tidal stripping as described in this section. We use the
concentration-mass relation, c200(m200, xsub), found in Sec. 2
and given by Eq. (6). Our boost factor ﬁts are valid in the
halo mass range 10−6 < M200 [M(cid:12)] < 1015 and their accuracy
is better than 5% at all masses:

4 SUMMARY

The internal structure of CDM halos, codiﬁed in the halo con-
centration parameter, has been extensively studied in the past
and, indeed, multiple parametric forms have been proposed
for the halo concentration-mass relation over a broad range of
halo masses, for diﬀerent cosmologies, etc. Yet, until now, no
functional form had been proposed for the concentration-mass
relation of subhalos, in part due to inherent diﬃculties, e.g., in
properly deﬁning and measuring subhalo concentrations and
masses. In this work, we made use of public data from two
Milky Way-size N-body cosmological simulations with a su-
perb subhalo statistics, namely VL-II (Diemand et al. 2008)
and ELVIS (Garrison-Kimmel et al. 014a), to overcome some
of such diﬃculties (Sec. 2). All together, these simulations
made possible to characterize the structural properties of sub-
halos with masses 106 − 1011 h−1M(cid:12). We ﬁrst described the
subhalo concentration cV based on a proﬁle-independent deﬁ-
nition in terms of Vmax and Rmax, and showed how this is re-
lated to the usual c200(m200) (Sec. 2.1). Then, we investigated
in detail how the concentration of subhalos varies as a function
of mass, maximum circular velocity and distance to the host
halo center, which allowed us to provide accurate ﬁts for the
subhalo concentration (the ﬁrst ones to our knowledge) encap-
sulating the mentioned dependences (Sec. 2.3). Qualitatively,
and as already shown in previous works, we found the sub-
halo concentration i) to slowly decrease with increasing mass
and ii) to signiﬁcantly increase towards the host halo center
for subhalos of the same mass. Since VL-II and ELVIS do not
provide data at the smallest and largest scales, we also made
use of the microhalo simulations by Ishiyama (2014) and the
BolshoiP large-scale structure simulation (Klypin et al. 2011),
respectively, to approximately account for the expected ﬁeld
halo and subhalo behavior at the two extremes of the full CDM
(sub)halo hierarchy. Furthermore, we studied the scatter of the
concentration of subhalos in both VL-II and ELVIS in diﬀer-
ent mass and radial bins (Sec. 2.4). Interestingly, we found the
subhalo-to-subhalo scatter to be similar to that obtained for
ﬁeld halos, i.e., of order 0.10 − 0.12 dex.

Subhalo structure and implications for DM annihilation

15

Our subhalo concentration results are particularly rele-
vant for computing the boost to the DM annihilation signal
due to the presence of halo substructure (Sec. 3). Since the
substructure boost is very sensitive to the way the structure
of subhalos is modeled at all masses (or equivalently, at all
maximal circular velocities), our detailed characterization of
subhalo concentrations is expected to have an important im-
pact on indirect DM searches. This is particularly true now
that the ﬁeld has reached maturity,14 and is therefore calling
for more accurate predictions of the expected DM annihila-
tion ﬂux from astrophysical targets (such as dwarf galaxies or
galaxy clusters). In previous works, as a ﬁrst order approxima-
tion, the concentration of subhalos was considered to be equal
to that of ﬁeld halos of the same mass. However, it was already
known that subhalos exhibit larger concentrations (Ghigna
et al. 2000; Bullock et al. 2001; Diemand et al. 2007b, 2008)
and this, in turn, implies a larger substructure boost factor.
Indeed, using our ﬁts for the subhalo concentration-mass re-
lation, we found boosts that are typically a factor of 2 − 3
larger than previous results (see Sec. 3.2 and, particularly,
Fig. 6), as those given by the model of S´anchez-Conde &
Prada (2014). Similar results have also been recently found
in Bartels & Ando (2015) and Zavala & Afshordi (2016) by
following diﬀerent but complementary approaches. In particu-
lar, Bartels & Ando (2015) adopted a semi-analytical approach
which includes information about both halo and subhalo mass-
accretion histories, subhalo accretion times, and consistently
accounts for tidal stripping in the calculation of the boost,
while Zavala & Afshordi (2016) used a novel statistical mea-
sure of DM clustering in phase space within subhalos to predict
the boosts.

This is not the end of the story though. Unavoidable tidal
forces aﬀecting the subhalo population remove mass from the
outer parts of subhalos and, as a result, they are truncated
when compared to ﬁeld halos of the same mass (Ghigna et al.
1998; Kazantzidis et al. 2004; Diemand et al. 2007a,b). When
taking tidal stripping into account (Sec. 3.3), the ﬁnal boost
factor for ﬁeld halos (such as our own Milky Way) is reduced
by a factor of about ∼ 30%. Yet, as also noticed by Bartels &
Ando (2015), this suppression is much more signiﬁcant when
considering the boost factor for subhalos (like those hosting
the dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way). In that case,
the removal of sub-substructure from subhalos results in total
boosts that are only at the level of a few tens of percent in the
most optimistic cases (we illustrated this in Fig. 7 for the case
of subhalos located at a distance of 80 kpc from the center of
their 1012 M(cid:12) host halo, similar to the case of Draco in the
Milky Way). Finally, we provided a parametrization of the
boost factor for ﬁeld halos that can be safely applied over a
wide range of halo masses, and that should be considered as
a reﬁnement of the model of S´anchez-Conde & Prada (2014).
Although this work is a necessary step towards a reliable

14 In the form of robust constraints on the DM annihilation cross
section that rule out, for the ﬁrst time using gamma rays, the so-
called thermal value for light DM masses (Ackermann et al. 2015).
Note, though, that this thermal value had already been reached
before by making use of measurements of the cosmic microwave
background anisotropy (for recent analyses, see, e.g., Lopez-Honorez
et al. (2013); Diamanti et al. (2014); Madhavacheril et al. (2014);
Ade et al. (2015); Slatyer (2016); Kawasaki et al. (2015)).

and deﬁnitive substructure boost model, some important is-
sues still remain for future work. In particular, it would be
desirable to build the model directly from simulation data at
all subhalo mass scales. Complementing the VL-II and ELVIS
results obtained here with other existent or upcoming high-
resolution N-body simulations should make possible this fur-
ther reﬁnement of the model. The precise slope of the subhalo
mass function (and its possible dependences with, e.g., host
halo mass (Hellwing et al. 2015)) is another source of uncer-
tainty that should be explored in detail in the future. Finally,
we note that ours and previous substructure boost models rely
on results from pure DM-only simulations. It is unclear at the
moment the role that baryons might have in this context (see,
e.g., the recent works by Fiacconi et al. (2016); Wetzel et al.
(2016)), and in particular their impact on the substructure
boost values.
