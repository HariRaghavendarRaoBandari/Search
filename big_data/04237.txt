OD elements of countable OD sets in the Solovay

model

Vladimir Kanovei∗

March 17, 2016

Abstract

It is true in the Solovay model that every countable ordinal-deﬁnable

set of sets of reals contains only ordinal-deﬁnable elements.

1

Introduction

It is known that the existence of a non-empty OD (ordinal-deﬁnable) set of reals
X with no OD element is consistent with ZFC; the set of all non-constructible
reals gives a transparent example in many generic models.

Can such a set X be countable?

This question was initiated and discussed at the Mathoverﬂow website 1 and at
FOM 2 . In particular Ali Enayat (Footnote 2) conjectured that the problem can
be solved by the ﬁnite-support countable product P<ω (see [2]) of the Jensen
“minimal Π 1
2 real singleton forcing” P deﬁned in [4] (see also Section 28A of
[3]). We proved in [5] that indeed, in a P<ω-generic extension of L, the set of all
reals P-generic over L is a countable Π 1
2 set with no OD elements. Moreover
there is a modiﬁcation P′ of P such that it is true in a P′-generic extension of
L that there is a Π 1
2

E0-equivalence class containing no OD reals, [7].

On the other hand, one may ask do countable non-empty OD sets without
OD elements exist in such a more typical generic extension as the Solovay model?
We partially answer this question in the negative.

Theorem 1.1. It is true in the Solovay model that every non-empty OD count-
able or ﬁnite set X of sets of reals necessarily contains an OD element, and
hence, in fact, consists of OD elements.

The Solovay model here is a model of ZFC deﬁned in [8] in which all pro-
jective (and generally all ROD, real-ordinal deﬁnable) sets of reals are Lebesgue
measurable. The case, when X is a (non-empty OD countable) set of reals
in this theorem, is well known and is implicitly contained in the proof of the
perfect set property by Solovay [8]. Hovever the proofs known for this particular
case of sets of reals (as, e. g., in [9] or [6]) do not work even for sets X ⊆ P(ωω)
(as in the theorem). In this paper, we present the proof of Theorem 1.1.

2 Notation

We consider the constructible universe L as the ground model by default. Sup-
pose that Ω is an inaccessible cardinal.

Blanket assumption 2.1. By a generic set we’ll always mean a ﬁlter , that is,
both pairwise compatible in itself and containing all weaker conditions.

Deﬁnition 2.2. We represent the Levy – Solovay forcing associated with Ω is
the set LS of all partial maps p : dom p → Ω such that dom p ⊆ Ω×ω is a ﬁnite set
and p(α, n) < α whenever hα, ni ∈ dom p. Let |p| = {α : ∃ n (hα, ni ∈ dom p)}.

If γ ≤ Ω then LSγ = {p ∈ LS : |p| ⊆ γ}; in particular LSΩ = LS.
If p ∈ LS and α < Ω then the α-component pα of p is a map deﬁned on

the set dom pα = {n : hα, ni ∈ dom p} ⊆ ω by pα(n) = p(α, n).

If G ⊆ LS is an LS-generic set over L then L[G] is the Solovay model, to

which Theorem 1.1 refers. The next lemma will be important below.

Lemma 2.3 (reduction to ROD). It is true in the Solovay model that if X is
a non-empty OD countable set and X ∈ X is ROD then X is OD.

Thus somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that it suﬃces to prove the exis-

tence of a ROD (real-ordinal deﬁnable) element X ∈ X in Theorem 1.1.

Proof. Arguing in the Solovay model, assume that

X = Xp0 = {x : ϕ(x, p0)} ,

where ϕ is a formula with a real parameter p0 ∈ ωω and hidden ordinal pa-
rameters. The set P = {p ∈ ωω : Xp ∈ X } is OD and contains p0 , and the
equivalence relation, p E q iﬀ Xp = Xq on P , is OD as well, and E has at most

2

countably many equivalence classes in P . However it is known that, in the Solo-
vay model, if an OD equivalence relation on ωω has at most countably many
equivalence classes then all its equivalence classes are OD, [6, 9]. In particular
[p0]E is OD, and hence the set X = Xp0 = {x : ∃ p ∈ [p0]E ϕ(x, p0)} is OD.

Deﬁnition 2.4 (ramiﬁed names). We’ll use the ordinary ramiﬁed system of
LS-names for diﬀerens sets in L[G], so that U [G] will be the G-interpretation
of a name U (basically, any set) deﬁned by ∈-rank induction by

U [G] = {u[G] : ∃ p ∈ G (hp, ui ∈ U )} .

Then, if G ⊆ LS is generic over L then L[G] = {U [G] : U ∈ L}.

Each set x ∈ L has a canonical LS-name ˇx ∈ L, such that ˇx[G] = x for any
generic set G ⊆ LS. Yet following common practice we shall identify ˇx with x
itself whenever possible.

Deﬁnition 2.5 (simple names). To somewhat simplify notation, we’ll make use
of a simpler system of names particularly for subsets of LS. Let N = P(LS ×
LS), and if t ∈ N and G ⊆ LS then t[G] = {q : ∃ p ∈ G (hp, qi ∈ t)} ⊆ LS.

Thus N consists of all LS-names for subsets of LS.
If γ < Ω then let Nγ = P((LSγ) × (LSγ)), so that any t ∈ Nγ is a LSγ-

name for a subset of LSγ .

The name G = {hp, pi : p ∈ LS} belongs to N, and G[G] = G.

3 Double names

In many cases below, we’ll consider pairs of LS-generic sets G, G′ ⊆ LS over L,
such that L[G] = L[G′]; note that this is not a (LS × LS)-generic pair! Similar
pairs will be considered for the forcing notions LSγ (γ < Ω) instead of LS. The
next deﬁnition introduces a useful tool related to such pairs.

Deﬁnition 3.1.
lef, ta
ta
names a = hta

rigi of names
rig ∈ Nγ will be called a double-name. Let DNγ consist of all double-

In L, if γ ≤ Ω then any pair a = hta

lef, ta

lef, ta

rigi such that ta

lef 6= ∅, ta

rig 6= ∅, and

(1) if p ∈ dom ta

lef then p LSγ-forces: (a) ta

lef[G] is LSγ-generic, and

(b) G = ta

rig[ta

lef[G]];

(2) if p ∈ dom ta

rig then p LSγ-forces: (a) ta

rig[G] is LSγ-generic, and

(b) G = ta

lef[ta

rig[G]].

Deﬁne DN = Sγ<Ω DNγ ; this is diﬀerent from DNΩ . It follows from (1) or (2)
that for any a ∈ DN there is a unique γ = |a| < Ω such that a ∈ DNγ .

Note that all sets Nγ and DNγ belong to L.

Lemma 3.2. Assume that γ ≤ Ω and a ∈ DNγ . Then:

(i) if Glef ⊆ LSγ is an LSγ-generic set and Glef ∩ dom ta

lef 6= ∅ then Grig =

ta
lef[Glef] is LSγ-generic, Grig ∩ dom ta

rig 6= ∅, and Glef = ta

rig[Grig] ;

(ii) if Grig ⊆ LSγ is LSγ-generic and Grig ∩ dom ta

rig 6= ∅ then Glef =

ta
rig[Grig] is LSγ-generic, Glef ∩ dom ta

lef 6= ∅, Grig = ta

lef[Glef] .

Thus each a ∈ DNγ induces a bijection between all LSγ-generic sets G ⊆ LSγ

satisfying G ∩ dom ta

lef 6= ∅ and those satisfying G ∩ dom ta

rig 6= ∅.

Corollary 3.3. If γ ≤ Ω, a ∈ DNγ , hq, pi ∈ ta
is a condition p′ ∈ LSγ compatible with p and such that hp′, q′i ∈ ta

rig , and q ⊆ q′ ∈ LSγ then there

lef .

Proof. Let Grig ⊆ LSγ be a generic set containing q′ , hence containing q as
well. Then Glef = ta
rig[Grig] is a LSγ-generic set containing p, and Grig =
ta
lef[Glef] by Lemmaio. As q′ ∈ Grig , there is a condition p′ ∈ Glef such that
hp′, q′i ∈ ta

lef . As p also belongs to Glef , p, p′ are compatible.

4 Full, regular, equivalent names

Recall that a set D ⊆ LSγ is dense if for any p ∈ LSγ there is q ∈ D with
p ⊆ q , and is open if (p ∈ D ∧ p ⊆ q ∈ LSγ) =⇒ q ∈ D .

Deﬁnition 4.1. Let γ ≤ Ω. A name t ∈ Nγ is full if the set dom t is dense in
LSγ . A double-name a ∈ DNγ is full if such are the names ta

lef and ta

rig .

A name t ∈ Nγ is regular , if the following holds: if p, q ∈ LSγ and p LSγ-
forces q ∈ t[G] then hp, qi ∈ t.
In particular, in this case, if hp, qi ∈ t and
p ⊆ p′ ∈ LSγ then hp′, qi ∈ t, too. A double-name a ∈ DNγ is regular , if so are
both components ta

rig . Deﬁne the regular hull

lef and ta

rht = {hp, qi ∈ LSγ × LSγ : p LSγ-forces q ∈ t[G] }.

of any t ∈ Nγ . If a ∈ DNγ then let rha = hrhta

lef, rhta

rigi.

Lemma 4.2. Assume that γ ≤ Ω and a ∈ DNγ is full. Then ran ta
lef[G] and ta
ran ta

rig = LSγ , and if G ⊆ LSγ is LSγ-generic then so are ta

lef =
rig[G].

Proof. To prove the genericity claim note that if say dom ta
lef is dense then any
generic set G ⊆ LSγ intersects dom ta
lef , then use Lemma 3.2. To prove the ﬁrst
claim, let q ∈ LSγ . Consider a generic set Grig ⊆ LSγ containing q . Then
G ∩ dom ta
rig[Grig] is generic and
Grig = ta

rig 6= ∅, see above. It follows that Glef = ta
lef[Glef] by Lemma 3.2. But q ∈ Grig , hence q ∈ ran tc

lef .

Deﬁnition 4.3. Names s, t ∈ Nγ are equivalent if s[G] = t[G] for any generic set
G ⊆ LSγ , or equivalently, if any p ∈ LSγ LSγ-forces s[G] = t[G]. Double-names
a, b ∈ DNγ are equivalent if tb

rig are equivalent to resp. ta

lef , ta

lef , tb

rig .

Lemma 4.4. Assume that γ ≤ Ω. Then:

(i) if t ∈ Nγ then rht is regular and equivalent to t ;
(ii) if a ∈ DNγ then rha ∈ DNγ , a 6 rha, and rha is equivalent to a —

therefore the set DNreg

γ = {b ∈ DNγ : b is regular} is dense in DNγ ;

(iii) if a, b ∈ DNγ then a is equivalent to b iﬀ rha = rhb.

Proof. (i) To establish the equivalence, assume that G ⊆ LSγ is generic and
q ∈ rht[G]. Then there is p ∈ G such that hp, qi ∈ rht. By deﬁnition p LSγ-
forces q ∈ t[G]. But then q ∈ t[G], as required. To establish the regularity,
assume that p, q ∈ LSγ , and p LSγ-forces q ∈ rht[G] — therefore p LSγ-forces
q ∈ t[G] by the equivalence already proved. Then by deﬁnition hp, qi ∈ rht.

(ii) follows from (i). The direction ⇐= in (iii) immediately follows from
(ii). To prove the opposite direction, it suﬃces to show that if names s, t ∈ Nγ
are equivalent then rhs = rht. Assume that hp, qi ∈ rhs. By deﬁnition p LSγ-
forces q ∈ s[G]. Then, as s, t are equivalent, p also forces q ∈ t[G]. It follows
that hp, qi ∈ rht, as required.

Example 4.5.
id[γ] = htγ, tγi. Then id[γ] ∈ DNγ is a full regular double-name and tid[γ]
tid[γ]
lef [G] = G for any LSγ-generic set G ⊆ LSγ : the identity name.

If γ < Ω then let tγ = {hp, qi : p, q ∈ LSγ ∧ q ⊆ p} and
lef [G] =

5 Double-name representation theorem

The next theorem shows that the double-name tool adequately represents the
case of a pair of LS-generic sets G, G′ ⊆ LS such that L[G] = L[G′].

Theorem 5.1. Assume that γ ≤ Ω, Glef, Grig ⊆ LSγ are LSγ-generic sets
over L, and L[Glef] = L[Grig]. Then there is a full regular double-name
c ∈ DNγ such that Grig = tc

lef[Glef], Glef = tc

rig[Grig], and tc

lef = tc

rig .

5

Proof. If Glef = Grig then it suﬃces to deﬁne c by tc
rig = id[γ].
Therefore assume that Glef 6= Grig . Then there exist conditions plef ∈ Glef
and prig ∈ Grig incompatible in LSγ . By a basic forcing theorem, there exist
names slef, srig ∈ Nγ such that Grig = slef[Glef], Glef = srig[Grig], and
every condition p ∈ dom slef satisﬁes plef ⊆ p while every condition q ∈ dom srig
satisﬁes prig ⊆ q . It is not true immediately that hslef, srigi ∈ DNγ ; we need
to somewhat modify the names by shrinking.

lef = tc

We can wlog assume that slef and srig are regular; as otherwise we can

replace them by resp. rhslef and rhsrig and use Lemma 4.4(i).

Deﬁne a = hta

lef, ta

rigi, where ta

lef consists of all pairs hp, qi ∈ slef such that

p LSγ-forces that slef[G] is LSγ-generic and G = srig[slef[G]],

and ta

rig consists of all pairs hq, pi ∈ srig such that

q LSγ-forces that srig[G] is LSγ-generic and G = slef[srig[G]];

then ∅ 6= ta

lef ⊆ slef and ∅ 6= ta

rig ⊆ srig .

We claim that a ∈ DNγ , and still Grig = ta

lef[Glef] and Glef = ta

rig[Grig].

Lemma 5.2. If Hlef is an LSγ-generic set and Hlef ∩ dom ta
lef 6= ∅ then
ta
lef[Hlef] = slef[Hlef]. Similarly if Hrig is an LSγ-generic set and Hrig ∩
dom ta

rig[Hrig] = slef[Hrig].

rig 6= ∅ then ta

Proof (lemma). By construction ta
lef[Hlef] ⊆= slef[Hlef]. Consider any q ∈
slef[Hlef], so that there is p ∈ Hlef with hp, qi ∈ slef . On the other hand, as
Hlef ∩ dom ta
lef 6= ∅, there is a condition p′ ∈ Hlef with p ⊆ p′ which LSγ-
forces that slef[G] is LSγ-generic and G = srig[slef[G]]. Then hp′, qi ∈ ta
lef by
the regularity assumption, and we have q ∈ ta
(cid:3) (Lemma)

lef[Hlef].

Now to check 3.1(1) for a let Hlef be an LSγ-generic set and Hlef ∩
lef 6= ∅. Then ta
dom ta
lef[Hlef] = slef[Hlef] by the lemma. Therefore Hrig =
lef[Hlef] is LSγ-generic and Hlef = srig[Hrig] by the deﬁnition of ta
ta
lef . Thus
srig[Hrig] is generic and slef[srig[Hrig]] = Hrig by construction. This is forced
by some q ∈ Hrig . On the other hand, as Hlef = srig[Hrig] 6= ∅, there exists
some q′ ∈ Hrig ∩ dom srig . We can assume that q′ ⊆ q . Then q ∈ dom srig , too,
by the regularity assumption, and hence q ∈ dom ta
rig 6= ∅.
We conclude that ta
rig[Hrig] = srig[Hrig] = Hlef , by the lemma. Finally
ta
rig[ta

lef[Hlef]] = Hlef ; this ends the veriﬁcation of 3.1(1) for a.

rig , and Hrig ∩ dom ta

Thus a ∈ DNγ . In addition, by the choice of slef and srig , some p ∈ Glef
forces that “slef[G] is generic and G = srig[slef[G]]”. Then p ∈ dom slef ,
p ∈ dom ta
lef[Glef] = slef[Glef] = Grig , as above.
Similarly we have Glef = ta

lef , Glef ∩ dom ta

lef 6= ∅, and ta

rig[Grig].

To ﬁx the regularity condition of the theorem, let b = rha; then still b ∈ DNγ ,

Grig = tb

lef[Glef], Glef = tb

rig[Grig], and b is regular, by Lemma 4.4.

It is not necessarily true, of course, that sets dom tb

lef and dom tb

rig are dense.

To ﬁx this shortcoming, we deﬁne

W = {p ∈ LSγ : ∀ q ∈ dom tb

lef ∪ dom tb

rig (p is incompatible with q)}

Thus indeed c ∈ DNγ , tc

b extends a, in symbol a 6 b, if just ta

Lemma 6.2 (in L). If β < γ ≤ Ω and a ∈ DNβ , then there is a double-name
b ∈ DNγ which extends a.

Proof. Let tb

lef consist of all pairs hp ∪ r, q ∪ ri, where hp, qi ∈ ta

rig be deﬁned the same way.

lef and r is a

This can be explained as follows. Suppose that Glef ⊆ LSγ is a LSγ-generic
set containing plef . Then the factors G′
lef = Glef ∩
LSγrβ are resp. LSβ-generic and LSγrβ-generic, and Glef can be identiﬁed
with G′
lef by the product forcing theorem. Then by deﬁnition the set
Grig = tb

simply G′′

lef[Glef] has the form G′

Deﬁnition 6.3 (restriction). Let α < β ≤ Ω. If t ∈ LSβ then deﬁne t↾ α =

It is not asserted that always a↾ α ∈ DNα !

Lemma 6.4. If, in L, α < β ≤ Ω, a ∈ DNα , b ∈ DNβ , and a 6 b, then

(i) if Glef ⊆ LSβ is an LSβ-generic set then (a) Hlef = Glef ∩ LSα is LSα-

rig 6= ∅ then ta

rig[Hrig] = tb

(iii) c = b↾ α belongs to DNα and a 6 c 6 b.

Proof. (i)(a) That Hlef is generic holds by the product forcing theorem.

(i)(b) If Hlef ∩ dom ta

lef 6= ∅ then Glef ∩ dom tb

lef[Glef] and Hrig = ta

Grig = tb
by Lemma 3.2, and Hrig ⊆ Grig since a 6 b. Therefore Hrig ⊆ H ′
Grig ∩ LSα . However H ′
Hrig ⊆ H ′

lef 6= ∅, and hence the sets
lef[Hlef] are generic sets in resp. LSβ and LSα
rig =
rig is LSα-generic by the product forcing. Thus both

rig are generic sets, hence easily Hrig = H ′

rig as required.

(iii) To check 3.1(1)(a) for some p ∈ dom tc

lef , consider any LSα-generic set
Hlef ⊆ LSα containing p and extend it to a LSβ-generic set Glef ⊆ LSα so
that Hlef = Glef ∩ LSα . The (generic by Lemma 3.2) sets Hrig = ta
lef[Hlef]
and Grig = tb
lef[Glef] satisfy Hrig = Grig ∩ LSβ by (i). On the other hand
Hrig ⊆ tc
lef[Hlef] = Hrig is generic, as required.
The veriﬁcation of 3.1(1)(b) also is very simple.

lef[Hlef] ⊆ Grig ∩ LSβ , hence tc

Lemma 6.5. In L, assume that α < β ≤ Ω. Then:

(i) if s ∈ Nα , t ∈ Nβ , and s ⊆ t, then rhs ⊆ rht ;
(ii) therefore if a ∈ DNα , b ∈ DNβ , and a 6 b, then rha 6 rhb ;

(iii) if b ∈ DNβ is regular and a = b↾ α ∈ DNα then a is regular, too.

Proof. (i) Suppose that hp′, qi ∈ rhs, i. e., p′, q ∈ LSα and there is a condition
p ⊆ p′ which LSα-forces that q ∈ t[G]. Prove that p also LSβ-forces q ∈ t[G].
Let a set Glef ⊆ LSβ be a set LSβ-generic over L and containing p; prove that
q ∈ Grig = t[Glef]. The set Hlef = Glef ↾ LSα is LSα-generic by Lemma 6.4
and still p ∈ Hlef , hence q ∈ s[Hlef] ⊆ t[Glef] = Grig , as required.

(iii) Assume that p, q, p′ ∈ LSα , p ⊆ p′ and p LSα-forces q ∈ ta

lef[G];
lef . As a = b↾ α, it suﬃces to show that

Lemma 7.1 (in L).

(i) If λ < Ω is a limit ordinal and {aξ }ξ<λ is a 6-

(ii) therefore the set DN = Sγ<Ω DNγ is Ω-closed in the sense of 6 ;

(iii) if {aξ }ξ<Ω is a strictly 6-increasing sequence in DN then the double-

name A = W{aξ : ξ < λ} belongs to DNΩ .

Proof. (i) Suppose that {γξ }ξ<λ is a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals

To continue with 3.1(1)(a), we prove the LSγ-genericity of Grig .
Let D ⊆ LSγ be a dense subset of LSγ , in L. Assume towards the contrary
that Grig ∩ D = ∅. Then there is a condition p ∈ Glef which LSγ-forces that

(iii) if Ξ′′ = {γ ∈ Ξ : c↾ γ is regular} is unbounded in Ω then Ξ′′ = Ξ .

Proof. (i) That Ξ is closed follows from Lemma 7.1(i). To prove that Ξ is
unbounded, let α < Ω and ﬁnd a larger ordinal β ∈ Ξ.

Recall that to decide a sentence Φ means to force Φ or to force ¬ Φ.
By basic forcing theorems, if p ∈ LS then the set

Dp = {p ∈ LS : p decides q ∈ tc

lef[G] and decides q ∈ tc

rig[G]}

is dense in LS, therefore by the ccc property of LS there is an ordinal β ,
α < β < Ω, such that Dp is dense in LSβ for all p ∈ LSβ . Then β ∈ Ξ.

(ii) easily follows from (i). To prove (iii) apply Lemma 6.5(iii).

Corollary 8.4. If γ ≤ Ω, a, c ∈ DNγ , and c is full (in the sense of Deﬁni-

Proof. By Lemma 4.2, ran tc

lef = ran tc

rig = LSγ . Now use Lemma 8.3.

In this case, consider the inverse double-name c−1 = htc

Thus if c ∈ DNγ is a full double-name then a 7→ a · c is a map DNγ →

a ∈ DNγ , and compare a with a′ = a · c · c−1 . On the one hand, we have

To ﬁx this problem, deﬁne the modiﬁed action a ∗ c = rh(a · c).

Lemma 8.5. Let γ < Ω and let c ∈ DNγ be a full double-name. If a ∈ DNγ
is regular (that is, a = rha) then b = a ∗ c ∈ DNγ , b is regular, and a = b ∗ c−1 .

Proof. That b ∈ DNγ follows from Corollary 8.4. The regularity holds by
Lemma 4.4. To prove a = b ∗ c−1 , note that both a and b ∗ c−1 are regular
double-names, and hence it suﬃces, by Lemma 4.4, to prove that a and b ∗ c−1
are equivalent. However, still by Lemma 4.4, b ∗ c−1 is equivalent to b · c−1 , and
b = a ∗ c is equivalent to a · c, hence overall b ∗ c−1 is equivalent to a · c · c−1 by
Corollary 8.2. Finally a is equivalent to a · c · c−1 , see above.

Lemma 8.6. Assume that γ < δ ≤ Ω, c ∈ DNγ and d ∈ DNδ are full
double-names, c = d↾ γ , and a ∈ DNγ , b ∈ DNδ . Then

(i) if a 6 b then a · c 6 b · d ;

(ii) if a, b are regular then a 6 b iﬀ a ∗ c 6 b ∗ d.

Proof. (i) is clear since a · c is monotone on both a and c. As for (ii), the
implication =⇒ holds by (i) and Lemma 6.5 while to prove the inverse make
use of Lemma 8.5.

9 Generic double-names and product forcing

By Lemma 7.1, we can consider the set DN = Sγ<Ω DNγ ordered by 6 as an
Ω-closed forcing notion in L (6-bigger double-names are stronger conditions).
Suppose that Γ ⊆ DN is a DN-generic set over L. Then a double-name A =
W Γ ∈ L[Γ] can be deﬁned as in Section 7; we call such double-names A = W Γ
generic over L (together with the background generic sets Γ).

Let Γ and A be canonical DN-names of resp. Γ and A = W Γ.

11

Remark 9.1. As L is our default ground model unless otherwise speciﬁed, the
sets Γ and A = W Γ do not belong to L, however all reals and generally all sets
x ⊆ γ < Ω in L[Γ] belong to L by Lemma 7.1. It follows that the deﬁnition of
DNγ (γ < Ω) in L is absolute for L[Γ]. That is, if a ∈ DNγ in L then it is
true in L[Γ] that a ∈ DNγ . And conversely, if a ∈ L[Γ] and it is true in L[Γ]
that a ∈ DNγ then a ∈ L and it is true in L that a ∈ DNγ .

Corollary 9.2. Assume that Γ is DN-generic over L and A = W Γ. Then

(i) it holds in L[Γ] that A belongs to DNΩ ;
(ii) if Glef is LS-generic over L[Γ], and Glef ∩ dom tA

LS-generic over L[Γ] and Glef = tA

rig[Grig] ;

lef 6= ∅, then Grig is

(iii) if a ∈ DN, a ⊆ A, and γ = |a| then A↾ γ ∈ DNγ ∩ Γ and a 6 A↾ γ 6 A.

Proof. (i) Remark 9.1 allows simply to refer to Lemma 7.1.

(ii) Make use of Lemma 3.2.
(iii) To prove that a′ = A↾ γ ∈ DNγ and a 6 a′ 6 A refer to Lemma 6.4(iii).
To prove that a′ ∈ Γ note that by Lemma 7.1 there is some c ∈ Γ which decides
each b ∈ LSγ to belong or not to belong to Γ; then a′ ⊆ c.

10 The ﬁrst ingredient

Generic double-names and forcing with LS × DN enable us to carry out the ﬁrst
main step towards Theorem 1.1.

In L, let HΩ be the set of all sets x such that the transitive closure TC(x)

has cardinality card(TC(x)) < Ω strictly.

Blanket assumption 10.1. Thus suppose that G0 ⊆ LS is a LS-generic set
over L, let X ∈ L[G0], and it is true in L[G0] that X is a countable OD
non-empty set of sets of reals. There is a formula ϕ(·, π) with some π ∈ Ord
as the only parameter, such that it is true in L[G0] that X is the only set x
satisfying ϕ(x, π).

There is a sequence u = {Un}n∈ω ∈ L of names Un ∈ L, such that X =
u[G0] := {Un[G0] : n ∈ ω}. Each Un can be assumed to be an LS-name of a
set of reals, that is, in L, Un ⊆ LS × T, where T is the set of all LS-names for
reals. Furthermore, according to the Ω-cc property of the forcing LS, each LS-
name for a real can be assumed to be a set in HΩ. Therefore we shall wlog
assume that Un ⊆ HΩ for all n.

Anyway there is a condition ¯p ∈ G0 which LS-forces over L that “u[G] is
the only set x satisfying ϕ(x, π), and u[G] is a set of sets of reals”. Let ¯γ < Ω
be the least ordinal satisfying ¯p ∈ LS¯γ .

12

Let a ¯p-pair be any pair hp, ai ∈ LS × DN such that ¯p ⊆ p ∈ dom ta

lef and p

LSγ-forces that ¯p ∈ ta

lef[G], where γ = |a|.

Remark 10.2. Let ¯a = id[¯γ]. Then h¯p, ¯ai is a ¯p-pair; ¯p LS¯γ-forces that
t¯a
lef[G] = G.

Lemma 10.3. Let hp, ai ∈ LS × DN be a ¯p-pair, q ∈ LS, b ∈ DN, p ⊆ q ,
a 6 b. There is a double-name c ∈ DN such that b 6 c and hq, ci is a ¯p-pair.

Proof. If q ∈ LSγ , where γ = |b|, then to deﬁne c add to tb
lef all pairs
hq, ri such that already hp, ri ∈ b. We claim that hq, ci is a ¯p-pair. Indeed if
Glef ⊆ LSγ is generic then easily (*) tc
lef[Glef], hence c ∈ DNγ .
Further ¯p ⊆ p ⊆ q ∈ dom tc
lef by construction. Finally q LSγ-forces that
¯p ∈ ta
lef[G] because so does p, and we can replace ta
lef since a ⊆ b ⊆ c.
If q /∈ LSγ then still q ∈ LSδ for some δ , γ < δ < Ω. Use Lemma 6.2 to get

lef[Glef] = tb

lef by tc

a double-name b′ ∈ DNδ with b 6 b′ , and argue as in the ﬁrst case.

Theorem 10.4. Suppose that Glef × Γ is a LS × DN-generic set over L,
A = W Γ, and hp, ai ∈ Glef × Γ is a ¯p-pair. Then

(i) p, ¯p ∈ Glef , ¯p ∈ Grig = tA

lef[Glef], and Grig is LS-generic over L[Γ] ;

(ii) u[Glef] = u[Grig] — in other words, any ¯p-pair hp, ai (LS × DN)-forces

u[G] = u[tA

lef[G]] over L.

Proof. (i) To prove the genericity apply Corollary 9.2.

To prove (ii) suppose otherwise. Then there is a pair hq, bi in LS × DN with

p ⊆ q , a 6 b, which (LS × DN)-forces u[G] 6= u[tA

lef[G]], that is

(†) if Glef × Γ is a (LS × DN)-generic set over L containing hq, bi, A = W Γ,

and Grig = tA

lef[Glef], then u[Glef] 6= u[Grig].

Let L ∈ L be an elementary submodel of a large model, such that HΩ ⊆ L,
Ω and π belong to L, card(L) = Ω in L, and L is an elementary submodel
of L v. r. t. all Σ100 formulas. Let L′ ∈ L be the Mostowski collapse of L;
still card(L′) = Ω in L. Note that L′ is a transitive model of Zermelo with
onto
−→ L′ is the identity on HΩ, hence even
choice, and the collapse map φ : L
on P(HΩ) ∩ L. In particular, φ(Ω) = Ω, φ(u) = u, φ(Un) = Un for all n,
φ(LS) = LS, φ(DN) = DN, HΩ ⊆ L′ , and even P(HΩ) ∩ L ⊆ L′ .

By the elementary submodel property, hq, bi still (LS × DN)-forces over L′

that u[G] 6= u[tA

lef[G]] — that is

(‡) if Glef × Γ is a (LS × DN)-generic set over L′ containing hq, bi, A = W Γ,

and Grig = tA

lef[Glef], then u[Glef] 6= u[Grig].

13

To infer a contradiction, note that since card(L′) = Ω in L, by Lemma 7.1 there
exists a set Γ ∈ L, DN-generic over L′ and containing b, hence containing a
as well. We underline that Γ ∈ L, and then A = W Γ belongs to L, too. Let
Glef ⊆ LS be a set LS-generic over L, hence over L′[Γ] as well, and containing
q , and then containing p. Then the set Grig = tA
lef[Glef] is LS-generic over L
and over L′[Γ] by Lemma 3.2, and in addition, u[Glef] 6= u[Grig] by (‡).

is the only set x satisfying ϕ(x, π) in L[Glef] while u[Grig]

Recall that hp, ai also belongs to Glef × A. Therefore ¯p ∈ Glef ∩ Grig
by (i). Thus Glef and Grig are LS-generic sets over L and both contain ¯p,
u[Glef]
is the
only set x satisfying ϕ(x, π) in L[Grig]. However L[Glef] = L[Grig] (because
Grig = tA
rig[Grig], and A ∈ L), while on the other hand
u[Glef] 6= u[Grig], which is a contradiction.

lef[Glef], Glef = tA

11 Stabilizing pairs and second ingredient

Let a stabilizing ¯p-pair be any ¯p-pair hˆp, ˆai ∈ LS × DN which, for some n,
(LS × DN)-forces U0[G] = Un[tA

lef[G]] over L.

Corollary 11.1. If Glef is an LS-generic set over L containing ¯p, then there
is a stabilizing ¯p-pair hˆp, ˆai ∈ LS × DN with ˆp ∈ Glef .

Proof. Let ¯a = id[¯γ], see Remark 10.2. Let Γ ⊆ DN be a set DN-generic over
L[Glef] and containing ¯a, so that Glef × Γ is (LS × DN)-generic. Let A = W Γ.
Then the set Grig = tA
lef[Glef] satisﬁes u[Glef] = u[Grig] by Theorem 10.4.
Therefore there is a number n ∈ ω such that U0[Glef] = Un[Grig]. Then there
is a stronger pair hˆp, ˆai ∈ Glef × Γ ( ¯p ⊆ ˆp and ¯a 6 ˆa) which (LS × DN)-forces
U0[G] = Un[tA

lef[G]]. We can assume that hˆp, ˆai is a ¯p-pair, by Lemma 10.3.

Proposition 11.2. Let hˆp, ˆai ∈ LS × DN be a stabilizing ¯p-pair. Assume that
Glef × Γ, G′
lef × Γ′ are sets (LS × DN)-generic over L and containing hˆp, ˆai,
A = W Γ, A′ = W Γ′ , and tA
lef].

lef]. Then U0[Glef] = U0[G′

lef[Glef] = tA′

lef[G′

Proof. By deﬁnition, U0[Glef] = Un[tA
for one and the same n.

lef] = Un[tA′

lef[G′

lef[Glef]] and U0[G′

lef]]

The second ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.1 will be the following:

Theorem 11.3. Assume that hˆp, ˆai ∈ LS × DN is a stabilizing ¯p-pair, ˆγ < Ω,
ˆa ∈ DNˆγ , ˆp ∈ LSˆγ , Glef, G′
lef ⊆ LS are LS-generic sets over L containing ˆp,
Glef ∩ LSˆγ = G′
lef].

lef ∩ LSˆγ , and L[Glef] = L[G′

lef]. Then U0[Glef] = U0[G′

Let’s show how this implies Theorem 1.1. The proof of Theorem 11.3 itself

will follow in the next sections.

14

Proof (Theorem 1.1 from Theorem 11.3). We argue in the assumptions and
notation of 10.1. Let Glef = G0 , so that ¯p ∈ Glef by 10.1. Then by Corol-
lary 11.1, there is a stabilizing ¯p-pair hˆp, ˆai ∈ LS × DN such that ˆp ∈ Glef . Pick
ˆγ < Ω such that ˆa ∈ DNˆγ and ˆp ∈ LSˆγ . Consider, in L[Glef], the set G of
all sets G ⊆ LS, LS-generic over L and satisfying L[G] = L[Glef], ˆp ∈ G, and
G ∩ LSˆγ = Glef ∩ LSˆγ . In particular Glef ∈ G . The only essential parameter
of the deﬁnition of G which is not immediately OD — is Glef ∩ LSˆγ . However
Glef ∩ LSˆγ itself, as basically any subset of any LSγ , γ < Ω, is ROD in the
Solovay model. We conclude that G is ROD in L[Glef].

On the other hand, suppose that G ∈ G . Then U0[Glef] = U0[G] by
Theorem 11.3. Therefore the set U0[Glef] can be deﬁned as U0[G] for some /
every G ∈ G . This witnesses that U0[Glef] is ROD in L[Glef], because so is G
by the above. Thus the set X = u[Glef] contains a ROD element. It follows
that X contains an OD element, by Lemma 2.3, as required.

(cid:3) (Thm 1.1 mod Thm 11.3)

12 Final

Here we prove Theorem 11.3 and ﬁnally prove Theorem 1.1. We argue in the
assumptions and notation of Theorem 11.3. That is,

(1) hˆp, ˆai ∈ LS × DN is a stabilizing ¯p-pair, ˆγ < Ω, ˆa ∈ DNˆγ , ˆp ∈ LSˆγ , the
lef ⊆ LS are LS-generic over L and both contain ˆp, and in

sets Glef, G′
addition Glef ∩ LSˆγ = G′

lef ∩ LSˆγ , L[Glef] = L[G′

lef].

In this assumption, we have to prove that U0[Glef] = U0[G′
towards this goal, our plan will be to ﬁnd:

lef]. Working

(∗) sets Γ, Γ′ ⊆ DN, DN-generic over L[Glef] = L[G′

lef], containing ˆa, and

satisfying tA

lef[Glef] = tA′

lef[G′

lef], where A = W Γ and A′ = W Γ′ ;

then the products Glef × Γ and G′
and containing hˆp, ˆai, so that U0[Glef] = U0[G′
accomplishing the proof of Theorem 11.3.

lef × Γ′ will be (LS × DN)-generic over L
lef] follows by Proposition 11.2,

By Theorem 5.1 there is a double-name C ∈ DNΩ in L, such that

(2) C is full, tC

lef = tC

rig , Glef = tC

lef[G′

lef], and G′

lef = tC

rig[Glef].

As Glef ∩ LSˆγ = G′

lef ∩ LSˆγ , we can further assume that

(3) the restricted double-name C ↾ ˆγ coincides with id[ˆγ] of Example 4.5, so
rig [G] = G for all G.

that C ↾ ˆγ ∈ LSˆγ is full and regular, and tC ↾ ˆγ

lef [G] = tC ↾ ˆγ

15

Let Γ be any set Γ ⊆ DN with ˆa ∈ Γ, DN-generic over L[Glef]. Then

A = W Γ ∈ DNΩ in L[Γ] by Corollary 9.2, and ¯p ⊆ ˆp ∈ dom A since ˆa ∈ Γ.

Corollary 12.1.

(i) The set X = {γ < Ω : A↾ γ ∈ DNγ } ∈ L[Γ] is a club in

Ω, and if γ ∈ X then A↾ γ is regular;

(ii) the set Y = {γ < Ω : C ↾ γ ∈ DNγ and C ↾ γ is full} ∈ L is a club in Ω ;

(iii) therefore Z = {γ ∈ X ∩ Y : ˆγ ≤ γ} is a club, and in addition ˆγ ∈ Z .

Proof. To prove (i) and (ii) apply Corollary 7.2; the unboundedness condition
in 7.2(iii) follows from the genericity of Γ and the density of the set of all regular
double-names a ∈ DN by Lemma 4.4(ii).
Claim ˆγ ∈ Z in (iii) follows from (3).

Now suppose that γ ∈ Y , hence C ↾ γ ∈ DNγ is full. Let a ∈ DNγ be

regular. Deﬁne a ∗ C = a ∗ (C ↾ γ) (see Section 8).

Lemma 12.2. The map a 7→ a ∗ C is a 6-preserving bijection of the set
DNY
reg = {a ∈ DN : a is regular ∧ |a| ∈ Y } onto itself, satisfying a ∗ C ∗ C = a.

Proof. If a ∈ DNY
reg and γ = |a| then a ∗ C = a ∗ (C ↾ γ) belongs to DNγ and
is regular by Lemma 8.5, hence a ∗ C ∈ DNY
reg . If δ > γ is a bigger ordinal still
in Y , and b ∈ DNY
reg , δ = |b|, then a 6 b iﬀ a ∗ C 6 b ∗ C by Lemma 8.6(ii).
Finally a ∗ C ∗ C = a holds still by Lemma 8.5, because C −1 = C (that is,
tC
lef = tC

rig ) by (2).

In particular, if γ ∈ Z then A↾ γ ∈ DNY

reg is
a regular double-name. Thus {(A↾ γ) ∗ C }γ∈Z ∈ L[Γ] is a 6-increasing sequence
of regular double-names. The following is a key fact.

reg , and hence (A↾ γ) ∗ C ∈ DNY

Lemma 12.3. The sequence {(A↾ γ) ∗ C }γ∈Z is DN-generic over L[Glef] =
L[G′
lef], in the sense that if a set D′ ⊆ DN, D′ ∈ L[Glef], is open dense in
DN then there is an ordinal γ ∈ Z such that (A↾ γ) ∗ C ∈ D′ .

Proof. The set ∆′ = D′ ∩ DNY
reg belongs to L[Glef] and still is dense in DN
by Lemma 4.4(ii). Therefore its C-image ∆ = {a ∗ C : a ∈ ∆′} still belongs to
L[Glef] and is dense in DN by Lemma 12.2. It follows by the genericity of Γ
that A↾ γ ∈ ∆ for some γ ∈ Z . Then a = (A↾ γ) ∗ C ∈ ∆′ , since a ∗ C = A↾ γ
by Lemma 12.2.

Corollary 12.4. The set Γ′ = {a ∈ DN : ∃ γ ∈ Z (a 6 (A↾ γ) ∗ C)} is DN-
generic over L[Glef] = L[G′

lef].

16

Let us check the other intended properties of Γ′ as in (∗).
To see that ˆa ∈ Γ′ , recall that ˆa ∈ Γ ∩ DNˆγ . It follows by Corollary 9.2(iii)
that ˆa 6 a = A↾ ˆγ . However ˆγ ∈ Z by Corollary 12.1(iii). We conclude that
ˆa ∗ C ∈ Γ′ . Finally ˆa ∗ C = ˆa ∗ (C ↾ ˆγ) = ˆa since C ↾ ˆγ = id[ˆγ] by (3). Thus
ˆa ∈ Γ′ , as required.

Finally prove that tA

lef[Glef] = tA′
It suﬃces to show that if γ ∈ Z then

lef[G′

lef], where A = W Γ and A′ = W Γ′ .

lef [Glef ∩ LSγ] = tA′ ↾ γ
tA↾ γ

lef [G′

lef ∩ LSγ] .

(5)

However by construction A′ ↾ γ = (A↾ γ) ∗ C = (A↾ γ) ∗ (C ↾ γ), and on the other
hand t(A↾ γ)∗(C ↾ γ)
lef [G]] for all G by Lemma 8.1, therefore (5) is
equivalent to

[G] = tA↾ γ

lef [tC ↾ γ

lef

tA↾ γ
lef [Glef ∩ LSγ] = tA↾ γ

lef [tC ↾ γ

lef [G′

lef ∩ LSγ]] ,

which obviously follows from

Glef ∩ LSγ = tC ↾ γ

lef [G′

lef ∩ LSγ] ,

and this is a corollary of the equality Glef = tC

lef[G′

lef] in (2) by Lemma 6.4(i)(b).
(cid:3) (Theorem 11.3)

This also completes the proof of Theorem 1.1 (see the end of Section 11).

(cid:3) (Theorem 1.1)

13 Conclusive remarks

Question 13.1. Is Theorem 1.1 true for arbitrary sets X , not necessarily
sets of reals? In this general case, the proof given above fails in the proof of
Theorem 10.4, since it is not true anymore that Un ⊆ HΩ and φ(Un) = Un .

It follows from Theorem 1.1 that, in the Solovay model, any OD set X of
sets of reals containing non-OD elements is uncountable. If moreover X is a
set of reals then in fact X contains a perfect subset and hence has cardinality
c by a profound theorem in [8]. Does this stronger result reasonably generalize
to sets of sets of reals and more complex sets?

Conjecture 13.2. It is true in the Solovay model that if X is an OD set then

(I) if X contains only OD elements then it is OD-wellorderable;

(II) if X contains only ROD elements, among them at leat one non-OD ele-

ment, then X includes a ROD-image of the continuum 2ω ;

17

(III) if X contains a non-ROD element then X has cardinality ≥ 2c .

The set of all LS-generic sets over L is a less trivial example of a set of type
(III) in the Solovay model.

A proof of (III) would be an alternative (and perhaps simpler) proof of

Theorem 1.1 of this paper.

It remains to note that Caicedo and Ketchersid [1] obtained a somewhat

similar trichotomy result in in a strong determinacy assumption.
