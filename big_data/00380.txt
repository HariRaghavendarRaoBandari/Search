Many-body entanglement is at the heart of the Kondo eﬀect, which has its hallmark in quantum
dots as a zero-bias conductance peak at low temperatures. It signals the emergence of a conduct-
ing singlet state formed by a localized dot degree of freedom and conduction electrons. Carbon
nanotubes oﬀer the possibility to study the emergence of the Kondo entanglement by tuning many-
body correlations with a gate voltage. Here we quantitatively show an undiscovered side of Kondo
correlations, which counterintuitively block conduction channels: inelastic cotunneling lines in the
magnetospectrum of a carbon nanotube strikingly disappear when tuning the gate voltage. Con-
sidering the global SU (2) ⊗ SU (2) symmetry of a carbon nanotube coupled to leads, we ﬁnd that
only resonances involving ﬂips of the Kramers pseudospins, associated to this symmetry, are ob-
served below the Kondo temperature. Our results demonstrate the robust formation of entangled
many-body states with no net pseudospin.

The ubiquity of Kondo resonances in quantum dots
relies on the fact that their occurrence requires only the
presence of degenerate dot states, whose degeneracy is as-
sociated to degrees of freedom which are conserved during
the tunneling onto and out of the dot [1]. Finite mag-
netic ﬁelds can be used to break time-reversal symmetry
related degeneracies and unravel the deep nature of the
Kondo state by tracking the magnetic ﬁeld evolution of
split Kondo peaks [2–11]. In a recent work [12], the strik-
ing report was made that speciﬁc transport resonances
were absent in nonlinear magnetoconductance measure-
ments of split Kondo peaks in carbon nanotubes (CNTs),
despite being expected from theoretical predictions [13–
15]. Even more intriguing is that those resonances were
observed in inelastic cotunneling measurements in the
weak coupling regime [16]. Because in [12] no compara-
tive measurement for the weak-coupling regime was re-
ported, the missing of resonances could not be unam-
bigously interpreted as a signature of the Kondo eﬀect.
From a closer inspection of other experimental reports
for the Kondo regime [5, 7, 10, 17], we notice that the
absence of some resonances seems systematic.

Motivated by these puzzling results, we have studied
low-temperature nonlinear electron transport in a very
clean CNT quantum dot [18]. By simply sweeping a gate
voltage [8, 19], we could tune the same CNT device from a
weak coupling regime, where Coulomb diamonds and in-
elastic cotunneling are observed, to a Kondo regime with
strong many-body correlations to the leads. Then, us-
ing nonlinear magnetospectroscopy, transport resonances
have been measured. The two regimes have been de-
scribed using accurate transport calculations based on
perturbative and nonperturbative approaches in the cou-
pling, respectively. The missing transitions in the Kondo
regime have been clearly identiﬁed, and their absence
fully taken into account by the transport theory. Ac-
counting for both spin and orbital degrees of freedom, we

discuss a global SU (2) ⊗ SU (2) symmetry related to the
presence of two Kramers pairs in realistic carbon nano-
tube devices with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) [20–23] and
valley mixing [16, 21, 24–26].
In virtue of an eﬀective
exchange interaction, virtual transtions which ﬂip the
Kramers pseudospins yield low-energy many-body singlet
states with net zero Kramers pseudospin. This result in
turn reveals that the blocked transport resonances in the
Kondo regime are associated to virtual processes which
do not ﬂip the Kramers pseudospin.

Measurement and modelling of transport regimes. The
device under study consists of a semiconducting CNT,
grown in-situ on top of two platinum contacts, used as
normal metal source and drain leads. Details of the de-
vice fabrication were reported previously [17] (see also
the methods section). The CNT junction is suspended
over an electrostatic gate and can be modelled as a single
semiconducting quantum dot of size imposed by the con-
tact separation (≈ 200 nm). All the measurements were
performed at a cryostat temperature of about Texp= 30
mK, with the ability to fully rotate an in-plane magnetic
ﬁeld up to 1.5 T.

The CNT level spectrum is depicted in Figs. 1a and
1b. Transverse bands, represented by the coloured hyper-
bolae in Fig. 1a, emerge from the graphene Dirac cones
as a consequence of the quantization of the transverse
momentum k⊥. Bound states (bullets) are due to the
quantization of the longitudinal momentum k(cid:107). Four-fold
spin-valley degeneracy yields the exotic spin plus orbital
SU (4) Kondo eﬀect [5, 6, 8, 13, 17, 27, 28]. The SOC
removes the spin degeneracy of the transverse bands in
the same valley (red and blue hyperbolae), and hence the
SU (4) symmetry [6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 28, 29]. Due to
time reversal symmetry, for each k(cid:107) a quartet of states
consisting of two Kramers pairs splitted by the energy
∆ = ∆SO arises.

∆ =(cid:112)∆SO

2 + ∆KK’

2.

When also valley mixing is present, Fig. 1b, orbital
states are formed which are superpositions of valley states
determined by the mixing energy ∆KK’. A quartet now
consists of two Kramers doublets separated by the energy

By sweeping the gate voltage, the chemical potential is
moved from above (electron sector) to below (hole sector)
the charge neutrality point and quadruplets of states are
thus successively ﬁlled. This pattern is visible in a typ-
ical measurement of the diﬀerential conductance dI/dV
versus the bias voltage Vsd and the gate voltage Vg, Figs.
1c, 1d, which exhibits a characteristic four-fold periodic-
ity. Figure 1c displays such a stability diagram for the
electron sector, where Coulomb diamonds and inelastic
cotunneling excitation lines are visible. Owing to signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent ratios Γ/U of the tunnel coupling to the
charging energy in the valence and conduction regimes,
Kondo physics dominates for odd hole number in the hole
sector shown in Fig. 1d. This statement is quantitatively
established in the following.

In order to investigate the dominant transport mecha-
nisms, we have performed transport calculations for both
regimes, using a standard minimal model for a longi-
tudinal mode of a CNT quantum dot with SOC and
valley mixing terms [16, 18]. The explicit form of the
model Hamiltonian ˆHCNT and the parameters used for
the transport calculations are provided in the Supple-
mentary Material. The transport calculations in the elec-
tron regime implement a perturbation theory (PT) which
is exact up to second order in the tunnel coupling Γ, and
well accounts for Coulomb blockade and cotunneling in
the presence of large charging energies U [30]. The re-
sults of the calculations for the diﬀerential conductance
are shown in Fig. 1g; a gate trace in Fig. 1e. The
perturbative theory well reproduces the position of the
inelastic cotunneling thresholds (panels 1c and 1g). The
width (and height) of the conductance trace in Fig. 1e,
however, are underestimated. The experimental peaks
in fact are wider than the nominal temperature, which
indicates that higher order terms are responsible for a
broadening of the order Γ [31–33]. Nevertheless, due to
the very small ratio Γ/U , the corresponding Kondo tem-
perature is very small, Kondo ridges have not formed yet,
and a perturbative approach still captures the dominant
tunneling mechanisms (Figs. 1c,1e,1g).

This situation radically changes in the hole sector
where the gate trace reveals Kondo ridges for odd
hole numbers. The theoretical trace is the outcome
of a nonperturbative numerical DM-NRG calculation
[34] which uses the same model Hamiltonian but with
slightly diﬀerent parameters. The strong suppression
of the conductance in the valley with even hole oc-
cupancy is an indication of broken SU (4) symmetry
in the presence of SOC and valley mixing [29, 35].
By evaluating the temperature dependence of
the
conductance in the middle of the 1h and 3h valleys,
our DM-NRG calculation, shown in Fig.
1h, yields
Kondo temperatures TK for the valleys with odd occu-

2

pation such that 0.1 < Texp/TK < 1, indicating that the
experiment is in the so-called Kondo crossover regime [1].

Selection of virtual transitions revealed by magne-
tospectroscopy. Having set the relevant energy scales for
both the electron and hole sectors, we proceed now with
the investigation of magnetotransport measurements at
ﬁnite source-drain bias, which have been performed for
diﬀerent ﬁllings. A magnetic ﬁeld (cid:126)B breaks time reversal
symmetry and thus the Kramers degeneracies. By per-
forming inelastic cotunneling spectroscopy, we can get
information on the lowest lying resonances of our inter-
acting system. The magnetospectrum corresponding to
electron ﬁlling ne = 1, 2, 3 of a longitudinal quadruplet,
as expected for the perturbative regime, is shown in Figs.
2a - 2c. For the case of odd occupancies, we call T -
transitions processes within a Kramers pair; C and P op-
erations are associated to inter-Kramers transitions, as
shown in Figs. 2a and 2c. Panels 2d-2f and 2g-2i show
magnetotransport measurements and theoretical predic-
tions for the electron and hole regimes, respectively. In
panels 2d-2f as well as 2h we have used our perturbative
approach [30]. The calculations in Figs. 2g, 2i, in con-
trast, are based on the Keldysh eﬀective action (KEA)
method [36, 37] and are non-perturbative. The nature of
the dominant inelastic transitions is clearly identiﬁed by
simply looking at the addition spectrum (dashed lines in
Figs. 2d-2i). Remarkably, all inelastic transitions from
the ground state are resolved in the cotunneling spec-
troscopy performed in the low coupling electron regime,
similar to previous reports [16]. When inspecting the hole
regime, though, it is clear that only for the 2h case, panel
2h, the experimental data can be interpreted by means
of a simple cotunneling addition spectrum; moreover, the
2e and 2h cotunneling spectra are very similar. In the 1h
and 3h cases shown in panels 2g, 2i Kondo correlations
dominate the low energy transport, and diﬀerences with
respect to the electron sector are seen. The zero-bias
Kondo peak does not immediately split as the ﬁeld is ap-
plied; rather the splitting occurs at a critical ﬁeld such
that the energy associated to the inelastic T -transition
is of the order of the Kondo temperature [1]. Conse-
quently, a Kondo revival [5, 29] is also observed in the 1h
valley at ﬁelds of about 1.2 Tesla, when the lowest pair
of levels merges. Striking here is the observation that, in
contrast to the 1e and 3e cases, only one of the two inter-
Kramers transitions is resolved in the experimental data
for the 3h and 1h valley. However, in particular for the
1h case, the P and C-excitation lines as expected from
the addition spectrum should be separated enough to be
experimentally distinguishable if both present, similar to
the 3e case. By comparing with the addition spectrum
(dashed lines in panels 2g, 2i), we conclude that it is the
P-transition which is not observed. Our KEA transport
theory qualitatively reproduces these experimental fea-
tures.
Magnetotransport measurements performed for other
quadruplets both in the conduction and valence regimes

exhibit qualitatively similar features (see Figs. S4 and S5
of the Supplement), and hence conﬁrm the robustness of
the blockade of P-transitions in the Kondo regime. Our
results naturally reconcile the apparently contradictory
observations in Refs.
[12] and [16]. Furthermore, they
suggest that the blockade of selected resonances in the
Kondo regime is of fundamental nature.

Fundamental symmetries of correlated CNTs. To un-
derstand the experimental observations microscopically,
we have analyzed those symmetries of an isolated CNT
which also hold in the presence of on-site Coulomb repul-
sion typical of Anderson models.

ˆ(cid:126)Jκ = 1

2(cid:80)j,j(cid:48)∈κ

2(cid:80)j∈κ(ˆnj− 1

In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, one ﬁnds a U (1) ⊗
U (1)⊗ SU (2)⊗ SU (2) symmetry related to the existence
of two pairs of time-reversal degenerate doublets, see
Fig. 1b, called in the following upper (u) and lower (d)
Kramers channels. The U (1) symmetries reﬂect charge
conservation in each Kramers pair with generators ˆQκ =
1
2 ) which measure the charge of the pair with
respect to the half-ﬁlling. Here is j = (1, 2) or (3, 4) for
κ = u or d. The SU (2) symmetries are generated by the
ˆd†j(cid:126)σj,j(cid:48) ˆdj(cid:48). Here (cid:126)σ is
spin-like operators
the vector of Pauli matrices. Physically, ˆJ z
u = (ˆn1− ˆn2)/2
and ˆJ z
d = (ˆn4 − ˆn3)/2 account for the charge unbalance
within the Kramers pair. Thus, an isolated CNT with
one electron or a hole only in the quadruplet has a net
Kramers spin (and charge). Fig. 3a shows the two de-
generate groundstate conﬁgurations | ⇓;−(cid:105), | ⇑;−(cid:105) of
the isolated CNT with an unpaired eﬀective spin (⇓ or
⇑) in the lowest Kramers pair and no occupation of the
upper Kramers pair. In the weak coupling regime, a per-
turbative approach to linear transport, accounting for
elastic cotunneling processes involving the doubly degen-
erate ground state pair is appropriate [38]. These virtual
transitions are denoted I or T when they involve the
same state or its Kramers partner, respectively, see Fig.
3a. A ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld breaks the SU (2) symmetries.
However, former degenerate CNT states can still be char-
acterized according to the eigenvalues of the ˆQκ and ˆJ z
κ
operators, since they commute with the single-particle
CNT Hamiltonian which has in the Kramers basis the
form (see Supplement):

where u/d = +/−, ˆNκ = 2 ˆQκ + 1, and at zero ﬁeld is
¯∆(B = 0) = ∆, ¯ε(B = 0) = εd, δε = δ∆ = 0. Hence our
ﬁnite-bias and ﬁnite magnetic ﬁeld spectroscopy allows us
to clearly identify the relevant elastic and inelastic virtual
processes according to the involved Kramers charge and
spin. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, in the weak tunneling
regime only energy diﬀerences matter, and hence both
intra-Kramers (I, T ) and inter-Kramers (P, C) transi-
tions are expected in transport. Upon increasing the
Γ/U ratio, this picture changes. As we shall demon-
strate, emerging Kondo correlations lead to the progres-

sive screening of the Kramers pseudospin of the dot by
the conduction electrons.

ˆ(cid:126)Jκ,

To this aim we observe that, when a sizeable tunnel
coupling to the leads is included, the CNT charge and
ˆ(cid:126)Jκ are no longer symmetries of
spin operators ˆQκ and
the coupled system, since the tunneling does not con-
serve the dot particle number. The occurrence of the
Kondo eﬀect, however, suggests that the CNT quantum
numbers j = 1, 2, 3, 4 are carried also by the conduction
electrons and conserved during tunneling [13]. Following
[35], we hence introduce charge, ˆQκ, and pseudospin,
operators of the coupled system. Under the assumption
that the tunneling couplings are the same within each
Kramers channel κ = u, d, the total Hamiltonian com-
mutes with the charge and pseudospin operators ˆQκ and
ˆ(cid:126)Jκ, which hence generate a U (1)⊗ U (1)⊗ SU (2)⊗ SU (2)
symmetry of the coupled CNT-plus-leads system. As
a consequence, many-body states of the coupled sys-
tems are characterized by the quadruplet of eigenvalues
(Qd,Qu;J z
κ is
indicated in the quadruplet. Such quadruplets can be nu-
merically calculated within our scheme for the Budapest
DM-NRG code [39], and yield (for the valleys with one
electron or one hole) a singlet groundstate characterized
by the quadruplet (0, 0; 0, 0) (and thus J 2
d = 0).
I.e., we ﬁnd a unique ground state with no net pseu-
dospin.

u ), where the highest eigenvalue of ˆJ z

In the standard spin-1/2 Kondo eﬀect the appearance
of a unique singlet ground state with no net spin is usu-
ally understood as the result of the screening of the quan-
tum impurity spin by the conduction electrons spins,
due to the antiferromagnetic character of the coupling
constant between such degrees of freedom [1]. To in-
terpret the spin 1/2 Kondo eﬀect in quantum dots, it
is possible to derive from an Anderson model an eﬀec-
tive Kondo Hamiltonian [40] given by the product of
the quantum dot spin and the conduction electrons spin.
The coupling constant for this product is positive and
thus antiferromagnetic. Also for the more complex case
of a CNT eﬀective Kondo Hamiltonians have been de-
rived, with positive coupling constants for Kramers chan-
nels identiﬁed by orbital and spin degrees of freedom
[13, 41]. The antiferromagnetic character of the coupling
constants remains also when, as in our case, the more
abstract Kramers pseudospin is used.

This situation is illustrated in Fig. 3c: the Kramers
channels are half-ﬁlled, whereby one charge arises from
the electron trapped in the CNT itself. For ∆ = 0
this CNT charge is equally distributed among the two
channels, while for large values of ∆/TK(∆), as in our
experiment (see Fig.
it is mainly in the lowest
Kramers channel. At zero temperature the localized
CNT pseudospin is fully screened by an opposite net
pseudospin in the leads, yielding the entangled conﬁg-
uration 1√2 [| ⇑;−(cid:105) ⊗ | ⇓;⇓,⇑(cid:105) − | ⇓;−(cid:105) ⊗ | ⇑;⇓,⇑(cid:105)] of dot
and leads pseudospins.

1h),

A natural consequence of the antiferromagnetic nature
of the correlations leading to this singlet ground state is
that only T -transitions are possible at very low temper-
atures at zero bias, as depicted in Fig. 3c.
At ﬁnite bias we use our non-equilibrium KEA ap-
proach.
Since from the (equilibrium) DM-NRG re-
sults we know that antiferromagnetic correlations of the
Kramers pseudospins rule the low energy physics, we im-
pose that this also holds at the level of the Keldysh ef-
fective action [12]. As a consequence of this assumption,
only inelastic transitions which ﬂip the Kramers pseudo-
spin, the T and C transitions, are expected, as shown in
Fig. 3d. The outcomes of the KEA approach are shown
in Figs. 2g and 2i, and well reproduce the experimental
observations.

Entanglement of Kramers pseudospins. To further
conﬁrm that it is the Kramers pseudospins and not dis-
tinct spin or orbital degrees of freedom which should
be considered in the most general situations, we report
results for the diﬀerential conductance as a function of
the angle θ formed by the magnetic ﬁeld and the CNT’s
axis. The combined action of SOC, valley mixing and non
collinear magnetic ﬁeld mixes spin and valley degrees of
freedom which, in general, are no longer good quantum
numbers to classify CNTs states. Nevertheless, the three
discrete T , P and C operations still enable us to identify
the inelastic transitions in the 1h and 3h case, indepen-
dent of the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. The angular
dependence of both energy and addition spectrum for a
ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld amplitude is shown in Figs. 4a, 4b
for the 3h and 1h ﬁllings, respectively. The corresponding
transport spectra are shown in Figs. 4c, 4d, respectively.
A perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld almost restores (for our
parameter set) Kramers degeneracy, thus revitalizing the
Kondo resonance for this angle. As the ﬁeld is more and
more aligned to the CNT’s axis, the degeneracy is re-
moved, which also enables us to distinguish between P-
and C-transitions. As in the axial case of Fig. 2, no
inelastic P-transition is resolved in both the experiment
and theory, conﬁrming antiferromagnetic correlations of
the Kramers pseudospins.

Our results clearly demonstrate that speciﬁc low-
energy inelastic processes, observed in the perturbative
cotunneling regime, are inhibited in the Kondo regime
due to the formation of many-body entangled states with
net zero Kramers pseudospin and the conservation of
the pseudospin quantum number. This signature of the
Kondo eﬀect is universal, in the sense that it does not

4

depend on the degree of the spin-orbit coupling or val-
ley mixing speciﬁc to a given CNT. As such, it is also
expected for SU (4) correlated CNTs, which explains the
missing inelastic resonance in the seminal work [5], hav-
ing up to now no consistent and complete theoretical ex-
planation. Furthermore, we believe that such pseudo-
spin selective suppression should be detectable also in a
variety of other tunable quantum dot systems with emer-
gent SU (4) and SU (2) ⊗ SU (2) Kondo eﬀects [4, 11, 42–
45].
This dark side of the Kondo eﬀect which we have un-
covered opens new potential for a selective preparation
of many-body entangled states by exploiting many-body
correlations. Usually, quantum entanglement suﬀers
from decoherence eﬀects [46, 47]. The Kondo-Kramers
singlets, however, are associated to a global symmetry of
the quantum dot-plus lead complex, and hence are robust
against decoherence arising from the electronic reservoirs.
This property may be of importance for quantum infor-
mation storage.

METHODS

Devices were fabricated from degenerately doped sil-
icon Si/SiO2/Si3N4 wafers with a 500 nm thick ther-
mally grown SiO2 layer and 50 nm Si3N4 on top. Metal
leads separated by 200 nm were ﬁrst deﬁned by electron-
beam lithography and deposited using electron-gun evap-
oration. A thickness of 2 nm Cr followed by 50 nm Pt
was used. A 200nm deep trench was created using both
dry-etching and wet-etching. A second step of electron-
beam lithography was used to design a 50 nm thin metal-
lic local gate at the bottom of the trench. Catalyst was
then deposited locally on top of the metal leads. Carbon
nanotubes were then grown by the CVD technique to
produce as clean as possible devices. Only devices with
room temperature resistances below 100 kΩ were selected
for further studies at very low temperature.
For the transport calculations, three diﬀerent approaches
have been used: a real time diagrammatic perturba-
tion theory (PT) for the dynamics of the reduced den-
sity, the density-matrix numerical renormalization group
(DM-NRG) method, and the analytical Keldysh eﬀective
action (KEA) approach. Further details are discussed in
the Supplementary Material.

FIG. 1.
Transport regimes and bound states of a CNT quantum dot. a, A CNT with spin-orbit coupling is
characterized by spin (blue, red) and valley (K,K’) resolved transverse modes (blue and red hyberbolae). The CNT chemical
potential (upper limit of the shaded regions of the Dirac cones) is adjusted by sweeping the gate voltage from positive values
(electron regime) to negative values (hole regime). Quantum conﬁnement yields the quantization of the longitudinal momentum
k(cid:107) (empty/solid bullets denote empty/ﬁlled bound states). b, A generic quadruplet of bound states is composed of two Kramers
doublets separated by the inter-Kramers splitting ∆. c and d, Experimental stability diagrams demonstrating the successive
ﬁlling of a quadruplet with electrons (panel c), and holes (panel d). On the electron side, sequential transport is exponentially
suppressed inside the Coulomb valleys; the dominant mechanism is cotunneling (panel c). The appearance of high conductance
ridges at zero bias (panel d) in valleys with odd holes is a signature of the Kondo eﬀect. e and f, Experimental gate traces
at zero bias are compared with theoretical predictions obtained with perturbative (panel e) and non-perturbative DM-NRG
(panel f ) approaches. g, Theoretical stability diagram for the electron side reproducing the experiment of panel c. h, Scaling
behaviour of the linear conductance in the middle of the valleys with odd hole numbers, G0 ≈ 2e2/h. The system lies in the
crossover regime (0.1 < Texp/TK (∆) < 1, with TK the Kondo temperature), as pointed out by the arrows.

FIG. 2. Energy spectra and magnetotransport in both cotunneling and Kondo regimes. a-c, Excitation spectra for
electron ﬁlling (ne = 1, 2, 3 from left to right). The parameters, ∆SO, ∆KK’ and J account for SOC, valley mixing and exchange
splitting, respectively. d-f, Current’s second derivative d2I/dV2 in the electron regime at gate voltages ﬁxed in the middle of
the 1e, 2e and 3e charge states, as a function of bias voltage and parallel magnetic ﬁeld. Each panel reports experimental data
(positive magnetic ﬁeld) and transport calculations (negative ﬁeld). The dotted lines correspond to the transition energies from
the ground state calculated directly from the spectra a-c. At odd ﬁlling (panels a and c), all possible ground state transitions,
denoted by C, P and T are observed in the experiment (panels d and f ). Being signalled by cotunneling steps in the current
ﬁrst derivative, they yield maxima/minima in the second derivative. Likewise for even occupation, except for the “a” transition
at high ﬁeld (marked by arrows), forbidden by selection rules. g-i, d2I/dV2 maps in the hole regime for the 1h, 2h and 3h
charge states. While the experimental results for the 2h and 2e cases are similar, the P transitions are no longer experimentally
resolved nor predicted by the transport theory, due to the Kondo eﬀect (panels g and i). These missing transitions are indicated
by arrows in panels g and i. In the Kondo-regime T and C transitions yield maxima in the diﬀerential conductance, and hence
zeroes in the second derivative. The experimental part of panels g, h and i has been adapted from [17].

FIG. 3. Ground state conﬁgurations and virtual processes of a CNT quantum dot with odd ﬁlling in the
cotunneling and Kondo regimes. a, In the cotunneling regime the ground state is doubly degenerate, with opposite values
of the Kramers pseudospin. Elastic cotunneling processes to source (S) and drain (D) leads (grey areas) involving the same
spin, I, and its Kramers partner, T , contribute to the linear transport. b, Kramers degeneracy is broken by a magnetic ﬁeld.
A ﬁnite bias allows us to identify the three inelastic processes T , P and C which connect the bound states within a quadruplet.
c, The ground state in the Kondo regime is a singlet with no net Kramers pseudospin. Only virtual T -ﬂuctuations which
involve a pseudospin-ﬂip matter at low energies. d, At ﬁnite bias voltages only the inelastic T , C transitions, which involve a
pseudospin ﬂip, are possible.

polar angle θ formed by an applied magnetic ﬁeld and the CNT axis. A classiﬁcation of the inelastic transtions according to the
T , C and P operations is still possible. c,d, As-measured and KEA transport calculations for the current’s second derivative
