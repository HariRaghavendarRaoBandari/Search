Abstract. We present a general construction of non-Gaussian proba-
bility measures on the space of distributional kernels obeying a natural
extension of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms of Euclidean quantum
ﬁeld theory in arbitrary space-time dimension d. These measures may
be interpreted as corresponding to scalar massive quantum ﬁelds with
polynomial self-interaction. As a consequence, we obtain examples of
non-free models satisfying the Haag-Kastler axioms of algebraic quan-
tum ﬁeld theory for arbitrary d. When d < 4 we are able to trans-
fer the measures to the space of distributions and verify the standard
Osterwalder-Schrader axioms, hence, by a well-known reconstruction
theorem, we also obtain quantum ﬁeld theory models satisfying the ax-
ioms of Wightman.

1. Introduction

One of the crucial diﬀerences between the axiomatic approaches to quan-
tum ﬁeld theory (QFT) due to Wightman [11] and to Osterwalder and
Schrader [8] on one hand and the algebraic QFT of Haag and Kastler [6]
on the other hand, is that while the former are stated in terms of point-like
localized objects (functions on space-time), the latter allows for notions of
extended locality. Indeed, the Wightman and Osterwalder-Schrader axioms
are formulated using a speciﬁc cosheaf of test functions and its dual sheaf of
distributions, while algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory deals with a precosheaf
of algebras of local observables and its dual presheaf of states.

One encounters an analogous pair of alternatives in diﬀerential geometry.
One can study a smooth manifold M via its de Rham complex of diﬀerential
forms or via its Alexander-Spanier cochain complex [10]. The forms of the
de Rham complex are certainly point-like localized objects (i.e. we have the
notion of a value at a point of M ), while the elements of the Alexander-
Spanier complex are not: by deﬁnition, an Alexander-Spanier k-cochain is a
function on the (k + 2)–fold product M k+2 appropriately localized near the

1

diagonal. Moreover, the de Rham complex and the Alexander-Spanier com-
plex are quasi-isomorphic and explicit maps realizing this quasi-isomophism
have been constructed in [3].

Thus it appears reasonable that while attempting to construct models of
algebraic QFT, one can take the Alexander-Spanier cochain complex rather
than the de Rham complex as a starting point and hope that in favorable cir-
cumstances a Wightman QFT may be recovered as well. The present paper
may be viewed as a realization of this idea in the special case of 0-cochains
on Rd, i.e.
scalar ﬁelds on ﬂat space-time, but we believe that the ap-
proach is worth investigating in general. For example, in order to construct
(Euclidean) quantum Yang-Mills theory, one may try to ﬁnd appropriate
measure on the dual of the space of Lie algebra valued Alexander-Spanier
1-cochains.

Our main results may be described as follows. We present a general
construction of non-Gaussian probability measures on the space of distribu-
tional kernels D′(Rd × Rd) (and hence on the Alexander-Spanier 0-chains
on Rd) obeying a natural extension of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms of
Euclidean quantum ﬁeld theory in arbitrary space-time dimension d. These
measures may be interpreted as corresponding to scalar massive quantum
ﬁelds with polynomial self-interaction. Using the main result of [9], we then
obtain examples of non-free models satisfying the Haag-Kastler axioms of
algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory for arbitrary d. When d < 4 we are able
to transfer the measures to D′(Rd) and verify the standard Osterwalder-
Schrader axioms, hence, by a well-known reconstruction theorem, we also
obtain quantum ﬁeld theory models satisfying the axioms of Wightman.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 some well-known results
on probability measures on locally convex spaces are reviewed. In Section
3 we construct a sequence of Gaussian measures supported on L2(Rd) and
converging to the free scalar quantum Gaussian measure on distributions
via approximating the standard Friedrichs molliﬁers with Hilbert-Schmidt
operators. We then extend this construction to L2(Rd × Rd) and obtain, for
every given polynomial, a sequence of non-Gaussian measures on the algebra
of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on L2(Rd) that has a subsequence converging
weakly in D′(Rd × Rd) by Prokhorov’s theorem. Since we do not deal with
point-like localized objects, it is not too surprising that problems related to
ultraviolet singularities do not arise in our approach. Imposing an infrared
cut-oﬀ and taking the inﬁnite volume limit is avoided as well, since our
measures are deﬁned directly on Rd rather than on bounded regions.

In Section 4 we prove that the limit measure so obtained satisﬁes the
analogues of the Euclidean QFT axioms, using that the sequence of mea-
sures supported in L2(Rd× Rd) satisﬁes approximately Euclidean invariance
and reﬂection positivity. In Section 5 we assume that d < 4, transfer the
measure on distributional kernels to D′(Rd) via an appropriate sequence of
localizing maps and verify the Euclidean QFT axioms. Finally, in Section
6 we show that for arbitrary d the limit measure deﬁnes a Euclidean net of

MEASURES ON HILBERT-SCHMIDT OPERATORS

von Neumann algebras in the sense of [9] and hence, by the reconstruction
theorem proved in [9], gives rise to a Minkowski space net satisfying the
Haag-Kastler axioms.

2. Preliminaries

In this section we present some well-known results on measures on locally
convex spaces; more detailed review may be found in [2, Section 7.13]. For
background on topological vector spaces the reader is referred to [12].

2.1. Characteristic functionals. In what follows by a measure on a topo-
logical space we shall always mean a ﬁnite Radon measure. Let F be a real
locally convex vector space and let F ′ be its dual space considered with the
weak* topology. The characteristic functional (or Fourier transform) of a
measure µ on F ′ is a functional on F deﬁned by

eiφ(f )dµ(φ),

f ∈ F.

(2.1)

Sµ(f ) =ZF ′

Sµ(h0) =ZH

Specializing to the case of a real Hilbert space H identiﬁed with its dual, we
obtain

eihh0,hidµ(h),

h, h0 ∈ H.

(2.2)

Note that in this case Sµ is norm continuous and if U is a unitary operator
on H one has

where U •µ is the image of µ under U .

SU •µ = Sµ ◦ U −1,

(2.3)

2.2. Tight measures. Recall that a sequence of measures µn on a topo-
logical space X converges weakly to a measure µ if

for every bounded continuous function f on X.

A sequence of probability measures µn on X is called uniformly tight if
for every ε > 0 there exists a compact K ⊂ X such that µn(X \ K) < ε for
all n. The following theorem is due to Prokhorov.

Theorem 2.1. (see e.g. [4, Chapter III, Theorem 2.1]) A sequence of prob-
ability measures µn on a completely regular space X which is uniformly tight
has a weakly convergent subsequence.

Theorem 2.2. (see [4, Chapter III, Corollary 2.4 and Theorem 2.7]) Let
F be a barrelled locally convex space and let µn be a sequence of probability
measures on F ′ with characteristic functionals Sµn.

(a) If the sequence µn is uniformly tight, the sequence Sµn is equicontin-

uous.

(b) If F is nuclear and the sequence Sµn is equicontinuous at zero, the

sequence µn is uniformly tight.

2.3. Constructing measures from functionals. The following result is
known as the Bochner-Minlos theorem.

Theorem 2.3. (see [4, Chapter III, Theorem 1.3]) Let F be a nuclear locally
convex space. For a functional on F to be the characteristic functional of
a measure on F ′ it is suﬃcient, and necessary if F is barrelled, that it be
positive deﬁnite and continuous at zero.

Analogous statement may be established for Hilbert spaces if one requires
[4, Chapter III, Section 1.3]). In

continuity in the Sazonov topology (cf.
particular, one obtains the following result.

Theorem 2.4. (cf. [4, Chapter II, Theorem 2.1]) Every nonnegative self-
adjoint trace class operator C on a real separable Hilbert space H is the
covariance of a unique Gaussian probability measure µC with mean zero on
H such that

Tr C =ZH khk2dµC (h),
SµC (h) = e− 1
h ∈ H.

2 hCh,hi,

We recall that a measure µ on a locally convex space F is called Gaussian

if for every φ ∈ F ′ the image measure φ•µ on R is Gaussian.

3. Constructing the measure on distributional kernels

3.1. A sequence of measures on L2(Rd). We ﬁrst construct a sequence of
positive selfadjoint trace class operators on L2(Rd), the space of real-valued
L2 functions on Rd, as follows. Let ϕn : Rd → [0,∞) , n = 1, 2, . . . be a
sequence of smooth functions satisfying

(2.4)

(2.5)

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

ϕn(x) = ϕn(y) if kxk = kyk,

ϕn(x)dx = 1,

ZRd
supp ϕn ⊆ B0,1/n,

where B0,1/n is the closed ball in Rd centered at 0 with radius 1/n.

We denote by Fn the operator on L2(Rd) with integral kernel ϕn(x − y)

and by An the selfadjoint operator on L2(Rd) with kernel

An(x, y) =

(1 + n−2dkxk2d)(1 + n−2dkyk2d)

ϕn(x − y)

.

Clearly An(x, y) ∈ L2(Rd × Rd), hence An is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator.
We set

where

Cn = A2

n, Rn = AnRAn,

R = (m2 + △)−1

is the covariance operator of the free Euclidean scalar quantum ﬁeld with
mass m and △ is the (positive) Laplacian on L2(Rd). Further, we denote

MEASURES ON HILBERT-SCHMIDT OPERATORS

5

by µn the centered Gaussian probability measure on L2(Rd) deﬁned by the
nonnegative selfadjoint trace class operator Rn via Theorem 2.4.

We denote by D(Rd) the space of compactly supported smooth real func-
tions on Rd equipped with the usual C ∞ topology and by D′(Rd) its topolog-
ical dual equipped with the weak* topology. Recall that D(Rd) is a barrelled
nuclear locally convex space.

The next two propositions reﬂect two basic properties of Friedrichs’ mol-
liﬁers: the operators Fn are uniformly bounded and converge strongly to the
identity operator on L2(Rd). In what follows, we denote the L2-norm of a
function f by kfk.
Proposition 3.1. One has hRnf, fi ≤ Kkfk2 for every f ∈ L2(Rd) and
some positive constant K. In particular, the sequence of the characteristic
functionals Sµn of the measures µn is equicontinuous at zero on D(Rd).

Proof. Observe that since

it suﬃces to show that

Using the inequality

one obtains

hRnf, fi = k

√RAnfk2
hCnf, fi ≤ kfk2.

An(x, y) ≤ ϕn(x − y)

hCnf, fi = kAnfk2 ≤ kFn|f|k2 = kϕn ∗ |f|k2.

Now (3.5) follows from Young’s inequality for convolutions and (3.2).

(3.4)

(3.5)

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.2. One has limn→∞hRnf, fi = k√Rfk2 for every f ∈
L2(Rd). Hence the sequence Sµn converges pointwise to the characteristic
functional of the centered Gaussian probability measure D′(Rd) with covari-
ance R.

Proof. Since the sequence Fn converges strongly to 1, one has

hence by (3.4) it suﬃces to show that

n→∞k
lim
√RFnfk − k

√RFnfk = k
√RAnfk → 0,

√Rfk,

f ∈ L2(Rd).

(3.6)

In order to prove (3.6) it is enough to verify that
k(Fn − An)fk → 0.

(3.7)
To show the latter, we ﬁx f ∈ D(Rd) and ﬁnd, applying the estimate ϕn(x) ≤
const · nd that

k(Fn − An)fk2 ≤ const ·Z (cid:18)Z αn(x, y)|f (y)|dy(cid:19)2

dx,

6

where

SVETOSLAV ZAHARIEV

αn(x, y) = nd(cid:18)1 −

(1 + n−2dkxk2d)(1 + n−2dkyk2d)(cid:19) .

1

Since αn(x, y) → 0 pointwise and αn(x, y) ≤ α1(x, y) for every n, (3.7)
follows from Lebesque’s dominated convergence theorem.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.3. According to [4, Chapter III, Corollary 2.6 and Example 2.3]
L´evy’s theorem holds for D(Rd): a sequence of measures on D′(Rd) con-
verges weakly if their characteristic functionals are equicontinuous at zero
and converge pointwise. Thus the measures µn converge weakly to the cen-
tered Gaussian probability measure with covariance R on D′(Rd).

3.2. A sequence of measures on Hilbert-Schmidt operators. We de-
ﬁne operators

ˆRn = Rn ⊗ Rn

h ˆRnf, fi ≤ constkfk2,

on L2(Rd) ⊗ L2(Rd) ∼= L2(Rd × Rd). It is easy to see that Proposition 3.1
implies
(3.8)
We denote by ˆµn the centered Gaussian probability measures on L2(Rd×Rd)
deﬁned by ˆRn. We ﬁx a polynomial of one variable P and identify L2(Rd ×
Rd) with the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on L2(Rd). Using the Ba-
nach algebra structure on the latter, we deﬁne a sequence of probability
measures on L2(Rd × Rd) by setting
ˆµP,n = Nne−kP (f )k2

f ∈ L2(Rd × Rd).

(3.9)

dˆµn

f ∈ L2(Rd × Rd),

where

N −1

n =ZL2(R2d)

e−kP (f )k2

dˆµn(f ).

In what follows, when choosing a subsequence from a sequence, we shall

always suppress the subscripts in our notation.
Proposition 3.4. The sequence of measures ˆµP,n on D′(Rd × Rd) has a
weakly convergent subsequence.

Proof. Observe that as in Remark 3.3, the measures ˆµn converge weakly to
a measure ˆµ0, hence

N −1

n =Z e−kP (f )k2

dˆµn(f ) →Z e−kP (f )k2

dˆµ0(f ) > 0

and thus

(3.10)
for some positive constants K1 and K2. By (3.8) the characteristic func-
tionals Sˆµn are equicontinuous at zero and Theorem 2.2 implies that the
measures ˆµn are uniformly tight. It follows from (3.10) that one has

K1 < Nn < K2

ˆµP,n(U ) ≤ K2 · ˆµn(U )

MEASURES ON HILBERT-SCHMIDT OPERATORS

7

for every measurable set U , therefore the measures ˆµP,n are uniformly tight
as well. Now Prokhorov’s theorem (Theorem 2.1) implies that the sequence
ˆµP,n has a weakly convergent subsequence.
(cid:3)

We ﬁx a convergent subsequence given by the above proposition and de-

note its limit by ˆµP .

4. The Osterwalder-Schrader axioms for the measure on

distributional kernels

In this section we prove that the measure ˆµP on D′(Rd × Rd) satisﬁes the

analogues of the Euclidean QFT axioms OS0-3 stated in [5, §6.1].
4.1. Euclidean invariance. We deﬁne a unitary representation of the group
Ed of Euclidean motions of Rd on L2(Rd × Rd) by setting

( ˆEf )(x, y) = f (E−1x, E−1y),

f ∈ L2(Rd × Rd), E ∈ Ed.

(4.1)

Since the operators ˆRn are clearly invariant under the action of Euclidean
rotations and reﬂections associated to this representation and the density in
(3.9) is unitarily invariant, the measure ˆµP is invariant under rotations and
reﬂections. Thus it remains to show that ˆµP is invariant under Euclidean
translations. We denote the action of a translation given by x0 ∈ Rd on an
operator L by L(x0), on a measure µ by µ(x0) and on a functional S by S(x0)
so that S(x0)

µ = Sµ(x0) by (2.3).

Lemma 4.1. One has

h ˆR(x0)

n

f, fi − h ˆRnf, fi → 0

for every x0 ∈ Rd and every f ∈ L2(Rd × Rd).
Proof. Observe that (3.6) and (3.7) together with the uniform boundedness
of the operators An and Fn imply

k(√RFn ⊗

√RFn)fk2 − k(√RAn ⊗

√RAn)fk2 → 0,

f ∈ L2(Rd × Rd).

One ﬁnds as in the proof of (3.7) that

k(F (x0)
n − A(x0)
for every x0 ∈ Rd. Hence
k(√RF (x0)
)fk2−k(√RA(x0)
n ⊗
n ⊗

√RF (x0)

)fk → 0,

n

√RA(x0)

)fk2 → 0, f ∈ L2(Rd×Rd).
and the result follows since the operators R and Fn are Euclidean invariant.
(cid:3)

f ∈ L2(Rd)

Proposition 4.2. The functional SˆµP is invariant under the action of Ed
on D(Rd × Rd) given by (4.1).

8

SVETOSLAV ZAHARIEV

Proof. As mentioned above, it remains to show that ˆµ(x0)
x0 ∈ Rd. By the proof of Proposition 3.4 ˆµn → µ0 and ˆµ(x0)
By Lemma 4.1 and (2.5) one has S(x0)
ˆµn − Sˆµn → 0, hence S
0 = ˆµ0. Thus ˆµ(x0)

Now using the unitary invariance of the density e−kP (f )k2
(4.2), (4.3) and (3.10), one ﬁnds that S(x0)

and equations
ˆµP,n −SˆµP,n → 0. Finally, Proposition

4.2. Reﬂection positivity. We ﬁrst study an abstract version of the re-
ﬂection positivity condition due to Osterwalder and Schrader on a Hilbert
space. Let Π+ and Π− be two mutually orthogonal projections in a Hilbert
space H and θ be a unitary operator on H such that θ2 = 1 and θΠ+ = Π−θ.
We set Π = Π+ + Π−.

Deﬁnition 4.3. (a) We say that a bounded positive operator A on H is
reﬂection positive with respect to the triple (Π+, Π−, θ) if Aθ = θA and
Π+AθΠ+ ≥ 0.
(b) A functional S on H is reﬂection positive with respect to (Π+, Π−, θ) if
the matrix Sij = S(hi−θhj) is positive semi-deﬁnite for every ﬁnite sequence
h1, . . . , hk ∈ Im(Π+).
(c) A measure µ on H is reﬂection positive with respect to (Π+, Π−, θ) if

(4.4)
for all f ∈ L2(Im(Π), Π•µ) satisfying f (h) = f (Π+h) for every h ∈ Im(Π).
(Here h·,·iΠ•µ is the inner product on L2(Im(Π), Π•µ) and we denote the
operator on L2(Im(Π), Π•µ) induced by θ again by θ.)

hf, θfiΠ•µ ≥ 0

Lemma 4.4. If an operator A on H is reﬂection positive, the functional
S(h) = ehAh,hi on H is reﬂection positive as well.

Proof. See [5, Theorem 6.2.2].

(cid:3)

Lemma 4.5. A measure µ on H is reﬂection positive if and only if its
characteristic functional Sµ is reﬂection positive.

MEASURES ON HILBERT-SCHMIDT OPERATORS

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that µ is reﬂection positive. We ﬁx h1, . . . , hk,∈ ImΠ+
and observe that
Sij = Sµ(hi − θhj) =ZIm(1−Π)ZIm(Π)

eihhi−θhj,hid(1 − Π)•µ(h)dΠ•µ(h)

eihhi−θhj,hidΠ•µ(h),

= KZIm(Π)
for some positive constant K, since hi − θhj ∈ Im(Π). Hence for every
sequence z1, . . . , zk ∈ C one has
(Xi
Xi,j

ziSij ¯zj = KZIm(Π)

zieihhi,hi)(θXi

zieih hi,hi)dΠ•µ(h) ≥ 0

(4.5)

which implies that Sµ reﬂection positive.

Conversely, suppose that Sµ is reﬂection positive and assume, without loss
of generality, that Im(Π) = H. Consider the following algebra of functionals
on H:

AH =(Xi

zieihhi,·i, hi ∈ H, zi ∈ C) .

Equation (4.5) implies that the positivity condition (4.4) is satisﬁed for
Im(Π+). One can show exactly as in [5, p. 93] that AH is dense in
f ∈ A
L2(H, µ) and that A
Im(Π+) is dense in the subspace of L2(H, µ) consisting
of functionals f satisfying f (h) = f (Π+h), hence µ is reﬂection positive. (cid:3)

The proof of the following is clear.

Lemma 4.6. Assume that the operators Ai on Hi are reﬂection positive with
respect to (Π+
i , θi), i = 1, 2. Then the operator A1 ⊗ A2 on H1 ⊗ H2 is
reﬂection positive with respect to (Π+

i , Π−

1 ⊗ Π+

2 , Π−

1 ⊗ Π−

2 , θ1 ⊗ θ2).

Lemma 4.7. Let µ be a measure on H that is reﬂection positive with respect
to (Π+, Π−, θ) and let F be a continuous self-map of H commuting with θ
and preserving Im(Π). Then the measure

is reﬂection positive.

e−kF (h)k2

dµ(h),

h ∈ H

Proof. This is a non-commutative analog of [5, Theorem 10.4.3]. Observe
that for h ∈ Im(Π) one has kF (h)k2 = kΠ+F (h)k2 + kΠ−F (h)k2 and that

kΠ−F (h)k = kθΠ−F (h)k = kΠ+F (θh)k.

Hence one has

e−kF (h)k2

= e−kΠ+F (h)k2

(θe−kΠ+F (h)k2

)

which easily implies (4.4).

we set

as well as for the induced operator on L2(Rd × Rd). Clearly one has

ˆΘ = Θ ⊗ Θ.

(4.6)

Lemma 4.8. There exists a sequence τn decreasing to 0 such that the oper-
ator ˆRn is reﬂection positive with respect to ( ˆΠ+

τn , ˆΠ−

τn, ˆΘ).

Proof. By (3.3) the kernels of the operators An are supported in neighbor-
hoods of the diagonal of Rd × Rd whose diameters tends to 0 as n → ∞.
(Here by diameter we mean the largest distance between a point in the
neighborhood and the diagonal.) Thus, since the free covariance R is reﬂec-
tion positive with respect to (Π+
0 , Θ) (cf. [5, Theorem 7.10.1]), one can
ﬁnd a sequence τn decreasing to 0 such that the operator Rn is reﬂection
positive with respect to (Π+
τn, Θ). Appealing to (4.6) and Lemma 4.6
concludes the proof.
(cid:3)
Proposition 4.9. The measure ˆµP is reﬂection positive with respect to ˆΘ,
i.e. its characteristic functional is reﬂection positive with respect to ˆΘ and
smooth functions supported in ˆΞ+

Proof. By Lemmas 4.8 and 4.4 the characteristic functional Sˆµn is reﬂection

L2(Rd) maps an operator of the form T ⊗ T to an operator ˆT given by

τn, ˆΠ−

ˆT (X) = T XT ∗, X ∈ HS(L2(Rd)),

MEASURES ON HILBERT-SCHMIDT OPERATORS

one easily checks that the densities in (3.9) satisfy the conditions of Lemma
4.7. Hence by Lemma 4.5 the functional SˆµP,n is reﬂection positive with
respect to ( ˆΠ+

0 , one can ﬁnd n large enough
so that f1, . . . , fk are supported in ˆΞ+
(cid:3)

τn and the result follows.

4.3. Analyticity and regularity. In what follows, we denote the complex-
iﬁcation of a real vector space F by FC. If µ is a measure on the dual of
a real locally convex space F we denote the extension of its characteristic
functional to FC by S C
µ . This extension (which may or may not exist) is

Recall that a functional on a complex locally convex space is called
(Fr´echet) analytic if it is continuous and its restrictions to ﬁnite dimensional
subspaces are analytic (see e.g. [7, Chapter 3].)

Proposition 4.10. The functional SˆµP extends to an analytic functional
SP satisfying

|SP (f )| ≤ K1 exp(K2kfk2) ,
for some positive constants K1 and K2.

f ∈ D(Rd × Rd)C

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that

n is the extension of ˆRn deﬁned as in (4.7) and h·,·i is the symmetric

bilinear form given by the inner product on L2(Rd × Rd). Indeed, the two
sides of (4.9) are analytic functionals and coincide on the real part of every
ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of L2(Rd × Rd)C by (2.5).
Now (4.9) and (3.8) imply that the functionals S C

converge uniformly on compact subsets of Ck, thus the sequence S C

verges pointwise to a functional which is analytic by Vitali’s theorem and
satisﬁes (4.8).

5. Transferring the measure to D′(Rd)

In this section we assume that d < 4 and transfer the measure ˆµP on

D′(Rd × Rd) to distributions on Rd.
5.1. The limit measure. We deﬁne linear maps Φn : D(Rd) → D(Rd×Rd)
by setting

Φn(f )(x, y) = f (x)ϕn(x − y),
Lemma 5.1. There exists K > 0 such that

f ∈ D(Rd).

h(R ⊗ R)Φn(f ), Φn(f )i ≤ Kkfk2

(5.1)

holds for every n and every f ∈ D(Rd).
Proof. We recall that for d < 4 the integral kernel r(x, y) = r(x − y) of R
considered as a function of the diﬀerence x − y is in L2(Rd) (cf. [5, Section
7.2].) It is easy to see that

h(R ⊗ R)Φn(f ), Φn(f )i = k((r ∗ ϕn ∗ ϕn)r ∗ f )fk1,

where k · k1 is the L1-norm. Using this, the Cauchy-Schwartz and Young
inequalities and (3.2), one ﬁnds that

h(R ⊗ R)Φn(f ), Φn(f )i ≤ krk2kfk2

(cid:3)

for every f ∈ D(Rd).

We denote the complexiﬁcation of Φn by ΦC

Proof. We note that S(n)

P (0) = 1 and thus, by the Bochner-Minlos theorem (Theorem 2.3)

P on D′(Rd). Further, since

Sˆµ0(f ) = e− 1

2 hR⊗Rf,f i,

f ∈ D(Rd × Rd)

we see as in the proof of Proposition 4.10 that

ˆµ0(f )| ≤ eK|hRC⊗RCf,f i|
|S C

f ∈ D(Rd × Rd)C

for some K > 0. Now (3.10) and Lemma 5.1 imply that

P (f )| ≤ K1|S(n)
|S(n)

(f )| ≤ K1 exp(K2kfk2) ,

(5.2)
for some positive K1 and K2, hence the sequence of analytic functionals S(n)
P
is uniformly locally bounded. Now [7, Theorem 3.1.5(c)] implies that S(n)
P
are equicontinuous, hence the measures µ(n)
P are uniformly tight by Theorem
2.2(b). It follows then by Theorem 2.1 that there exists a subsequence of

pointwise to the characteristic functional of µ∞
P . Finally, using (5.2), one
sees exactly as in the proof of Proposition 4.10 that the limit functional is
analytic.
(cid:3)

5.2. Veriﬁcation of the axioms. The following theorem asserts that S∞
P
satisﬁes the axioms OS0–3 from [5, Section 6.1] except the local integrability
condition in the regularity axiom OS1.

Theorem 5.3. The functional S∞

P satisﬁes:

P is an analytic functional on D(Rd)C.

(1) (Analyticity) S∞
(2) (Regularity) One has
|S∞
P (f )| ≤ K1 exp(K2kfk2)

P (Ef ) = S∞

(3) (Euclidean invariance) One has S∞

for every f ∈ D(Rd)C and some positive constants K1 and K2.
D(Rd) and every Euclidean transformation E of Rd.

P (f ) for every f ∈
(4) (Reﬂection positivity) For every f1, . . . , fk ∈ D(Rd) supported in the
P (fi − Θfj) is positive semi-deﬁnite.
Proof. Note that (1) was proved in Proposition 5.2 and that (2) follows
from (5.2). To establish (3), we observe that the maps Φp are Euclidean
equivariant and appeal to Proposition 4.2.

0 the matrix Sij = S∞

t > 0 halfspace Ξ+

To prove (4), recall that the kernels of the operators Fn are supported
in neighborhoods of the diagonal of Rd × Rd whose diameters tends to 0
as n → ∞. Thus, given f1, . . . , fk supported in Ξ+
0 one can ﬁnd n large
enough so that Φn(f1), . . . , Φn(fk) are supported in ˆΞ+
0 . Now Proposition 4.9
implies that the matrix S(n)
P (fi − Θfj) is positive semi-deﬁnite, establishing
the reﬂection positivity of S∞
P .

(cid:3)

In what follows, we write

for the second moment of a measure µ.

Cµ(f, f ) =Z φ(f )2dµ(φ)

Lemma 5.4. One has

Cµ∞

0 (f, f ) = hR(2)f, fi,

f ∈ D(Rd)

is the measure µ∞

where µ∞
0
P = 0 and R(2) denotes the integral operator with kernel r2(x, y).
Proof. We ﬁx f ∈ D(Rd) and note that since r(x − y) is in L2(Rd), the
function f (x)r(x, y)f (y) is in L2(R2d). Thus the sequence

P deﬁned in the proof of Proposition 5.2 when

ψn(x, y) =ZR2d

f (x1)r(x1, y1)f (y1)ϕn(x − x1)ϕn(y − y1)dx1dy1

converges weakly to f (x)r(x, y)f (y), i.e. one has

hψn, gi → hf rf, gi

(5.3)

14

SVETOSLAV ZAHARIEV

for every g ∈ L2(R2d). Since the supports of ψn(x, y) are contained in a
compact set V for all n, we can take g(x, y) = χV · r(x, y) in (5.3) to obtain

Cµ∞

0 (f, f ) = lim

n→∞h(R ⊗ R)Φn(f ), Φn(f )i =ZR2d

r2(x, y)f (x)f (y)dxdy.

(cid:3)

Recall that the analyticity and regularity axioms imply that the moments
of all orders of the measure µ∞
P deﬁned in the proof of Proposition 5.2 exist
and extend to continuous multilinear functionals on L2(Rd) × ··· × L2(Rd)
(cf. [5, Propositions 6.1.4 and 19.1.1]).

Lemma 5.5. Let f = χ(0,t) ⊗ h, where h ∈ D(Rd−1) and χ(0,t) is the
indicator function of the interval (0, t). Then

ZD′(Rd)

φ(f )2dµ∞

P (φ) = o(t) as t → 0.

Proof. Since the kernel r2(x, y) satisﬁes the local integrability condition in
the regularity axiom OS1 in [5, Section 6.1] one has

hR(2)f, fi = o(t) as t → 0,

(5.4)

for f = χ(0,t) ⊗ h by [5, Proposition 19.1.4]. We note that

CˆµP (Φn(f ), Φn(f )) ≤ const · Cˆµ0 (Φn(f ), Φn(f ))

by (3.10), hence

Cµ∞
P

(f, f ) ≤ const · Cµ∞

0 (f, f )

and the result follows from (5.4) and Lemma 5.4.

(cid:3)

Theorem 5.6. The functional S∞
P deﬁnes a relativistic quantum ﬁeld sat-
isfying all Wightman axioms except possibly the uniqueness of the vacuum
axiom.

Proof. It is proved in [5, Chapter 19] that the axioms OS0–3 imply the
Wightman axioms except the uniqueness of the vacuum. An inspection of
this proof reveals that the only place where the local integrability condition
in the regularity axiom is used is Proposition 19.1.4 in [5]. However, the
statement of this proposition holds for the measure µ∞
P by Lemma 5.5. (cid:3)

We remind the reader that one can obtain measures satisfying the ergod-
icity axiom in addition to axioms OS0-3 (and hence relativistic quantum
ﬁelds satisfying all Wightman axioms) by an appropriate decomposition of
the measure µ∞

P , as explained in [5, Section 19.7].

6. From Euclidean QFT to algebraic QFT

6.1. Haag-Kastler nets and Euclidean nets. In this subsection we re-
view the basic notions of algebraic QFT (see [6] and [1] for details) and state
the reconstruction theorem of [9]. Recall that a local net of C ∗-algebras over
a metric space X is an assignment U 7→ A(U ) of a unital C ∗-algebra to
every bounded open subset U of X such that there is an inclusion of unital
algebras A(U1) ⊂ A(U2) whenever U1 ⊂ U2. Local algebras A(U ) for un-
bounded U are obtained by taking the C ∗-algebraic inductive limit over all
bounded sets contained in U . (Thus, in modern terminology, a local net is
essentially a ﬂabby precosheaf respecting direct limits.)

In what follows we denote by Md the d-dimensional Minkowski space and

by P d the d-dimensional Poincar´e group.

Deﬁnition 6.1. A Haag-Kastler net is a local net A of C ∗-algebras over Md
satisfying

(1) (covariance) there is a group homomorphism α : Hom(P d, Aut(A(Md)))
such that α(g)(A(U )) = A(g(U )) for every g ∈ P d and every open bounded
U ∈ Md,
(2) (causality) [A(U1), A(U2)] = {0} whenever U1 and U2 are space-like
separated.

Deﬁnition 6.2. (a) Let A be a Haag-Kastler net. A representation π of
A(Md) on a complex Hilbert space H is called a vacuum representation if
(1) there is a strongly continuous unitary representation g 7→ U (g) of P d

on H such that

U (g)π(a)U ∗(g) = π(α(g)(a))

for every a ∈ A(Md),

(2) there is a P d-invariant non-zero vector in H.
(b) A vacuum representation satisﬁes the spectrum condition if the selfad-
joint generators of the representation g 7→ U (g) of the translation subgroup
of P d have spectrum contained in the closed forward light cone in Md.

The next two deﬁnitions are adapted from [9].

Deﬁnition 6.3. (a) A Euclidean net is a local net A of C ∗-algebras over Rd
satisfying

(1) (covariance) there is a group homomorphism α : Hom(Ed, Aut(A(Rd)))
such that α(g)(A(U )) = A(g(U )) for every g ∈ Ed and every open bounded
U ∈ Rd,

(2) (locality) [A(U1), A(U2)] = {0} whenever U1 and U2 are disjoint.
(b) A Euclidean net A satisﬁes the time-zero property if

A(Ξ+

0 ) ∩ A(Ξ−

0 ) 6= C.

Deﬁnition 6.4. (a) Let A be a Euclidean net. A vacuum functional on A
is a continuous linear functional η on A(Rd) satisfying

(1) η(1) = 1,

16

SVETOSLAV ZAHARIEV

(2) η ◦ α(g) = η for every g ∈ Ed,
(3) the map

g 7→ η(a1α(g)(a2)a3)

(b) A vacuum functional is reﬂection positive if η(α(Θ)(a∗)a) ≥ 0 for

is continuous for every a1, a2, a3 ∈ A(Rd).
every a ∈ A(Ξ+
0 ).
Theorem 6.5. (cf. [9, Theorems 3.4 and 3.7]) Every pair (A, η), where A is
a Euclidean net over Rd satisfying the time-zero property and η is a reﬂection
positive vacuum functional on A, gives rise to a Haag-Kastler net over Md
equipped with a vacuum representation satisfying the spectrum condition.

6.2. Examples of non-free algebraic QFT models in all space-time
dimensions. In this subsection we demonstrate that the measure ˆµP on
D′(Rd × Rd) constructed in Section 3 gives rise to a Euclidean net satisfying
the time-zero property as well as to reﬂection positive vacuum functionals
on this net.

For every f ∈ D(Rd × Rd) we denote by Of the bounded operator on
L2(ˆµP )C ≡ L2(D′(Rd × Rd), ˆµP )C given by multiplication with the bounded
functional eiφ(f ). We construct a local net AP of C ∗-algebras over Rd by
taking AP (U ) to be the von Neumann algebra generated by the set

for every open U . We set

{Of : f ∈ D(U × U )}

B+ =nh ∈ L2(ˆµP )C : h(φ) =Xj

zieiφ(fj ), fj ∈ D(ˆΞ+

0 ), zj ∈ Co.

Recall that since the measure ˆµP is Euclidean invariant, the action of Ed on
D′(Rd × Rd) induces a strongly continuous unitary representation g 7→ U (g)
of Ed on L2(ˆµP )C.

Proposition 6.6. The local net AP is Euclidean. Moreover, for every ω ∈
B+ which is Ed-invariant and of norm 1 (e.g. the constant functional 1),
the functional

ηω(a) = hω, aωiL2(ˆµP )C,

a ∈ AP (Rd)

is a reﬂection positive vacuum functional on AP .

(6.1)

Proof. Observe that the map

Ed ∋ g 7→ U (g)Of U ∗(g),

f ∈ D(Rd × Rd)

extends to a group homomorphism α : Hom(Ed, Aut(AP (Rd))). Further,
since the map f 7→ Of clearly is Ed-equivariant, α satisﬁes the covariance
condition in Deﬁnition 6.3. The locality condition automatically holds since
the algebras AP (U ) are commutative, thus AP is a Euclidean net.

MEASURES ON HILBERT-SCHMIDT OPERATORS

It is easy to see that ηω given by (6.1) is a vacuum functional for AP . To
0 ) one

check that ηω is reﬂection positive, we note that for every f ∈ D(ˆΞ+
has
f U ∗(Θ)Of ωi = hOΘ(f )ω, Of ωi = hU (Θ)Of ω, Of ωi ≥ 0

hω, U (Θ)O∗

since Of ω ∈ B+ and ˆµP is reﬂection positive by Proposition 4.9.
Proposition 6.7. The Euclidean net AP satisﬁes the time-zero property.

(cid:3)

Proof. We ﬁrst assume that P = 0. In this case the statement follows from
the proof of the ﬁrst part of [5, Theorem 6.2.6], however for completeness
we shall present the argument here.

A short computation employing the deﬁnition of characteristic functional
of a Gaussian measure µC on D′(Rd× Rd) with covariance operator C shows
that

Z (cid:12)(cid:12)eiφ(f ) − eiφ(g)(cid:12)(cid:12)dµC(φ) = 2(1 − e−kC1/2(f −g)k2/2),

(6.2)
where f, g ∈ D(Rd × Rd) and φ(f ), φ(g) are the corresponding functionals
on D′(Rd × Rd).
For every f ∈ D(Rd−1 × Rd−1) consider the distribution on Rd × Rd given
by

fτ (x, x′) = f (x, x′)δτ (t)δτ (t′),

where δτ (t) is the delta function centered at τ . We claim that there exists a
sequence fn in D(Rd × Rd) supported in ˆΞ+
0 converging to f0 in D′. Indeed,
consider a sequence of positive numbers τn decreasing to 0 and a sequence
gn,m in D(R) converging to δτn(t) as m → ∞. One can ﬁnd a subsequence
gn,j(n) supported on (0,∞) and converging to δ0(t) as n → ∞ from which
the claim easily follows.
Now recall that the operator ˆR1/2 = R1/2 ⊗ R1/2 maps weakly converging
sequences with support in a ﬁxed compact set to norm converging sequences.
Thus applying (6.2) to the measure ˆµ0 with covariance ˆR we see that eifn
is a Cauchy sequence in L2(ˆµ0)C, hence it has a limit in L2(ˆµ0)C which
we denote by eif0. This implies that the operator given by multiplication
with eif0 is in A0(Ξ+
0 ) and the same argument shows that this operator is
in A0(Ξ−

0 ) as well, hence A0(Ξ+

Finally, let us consider the case of a general P . Observe that by the proof

0 ) ∩ A0(Ξ−

0 ) 6= C.

of Proposition 3.4 we have

for every measurable set U and hence

ˆµP,n(U ) ≤ const · ˆµn(U )

Since ˆµP,n → ˆµP and ˆµn → ˆµ0 weakly, the last inequality and (6.2) imply

Z (cid:12)(cid:12)eiφ(f ) − eiφ(g)(cid:12)(cid:12)dˆµP,n(φ) ≤ const ·Z (cid:12)(cid:12)eiφ(f ) − eiφ(g)(cid:12)(cid:12)dˆµn(φ).
Z (cid:12)(cid:12)eiφ(f ) − eiφ(g)(cid:12)(cid:12)dˆµP (φ) ≤ const · (1 − e−k ˆR1/2(f −g)k2/2).

18

Using this, the argument above shows that AP (Ξ+

0 ) ∩ AP (Ξ−

0 ) 6= C.

(cid:3)

Theorem 6.8. Every pair (AP , ηω), where ηω is given by (6.1), gives rise
to a Haag-Kastler net over Md equipped with a vacuum representation sat-
isfying the spectrum condition.

Proof. This follows from Propositions 6.6, 6.7 and Theorem 6.5.
