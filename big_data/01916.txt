Quantum Darwinism recognizes the role of the environment as a communication channel: Decoher-
ence can selectively amplify information about the pointer states of a system of interest (preventing
access to complementary information about their superpositions) and can make records of this infor-
mation accessible to many observers. This redundancy explains the emergence of objective, classical
reality in our quantum Universe. Here, we demonstrate that the ampliﬁcation of information in real-
istic spin environments can be quantiﬁed by the quantum Chernoﬀ information, which characterizes
the distinguishability of partial records in individual environment subsystems. We show that, except
for a set of initial states of measure zero, the environment always acquires redundant information.
Moreover, the Chernoﬀ information captures the rich behavior of ampliﬁcation in both ﬁnite and
inﬁnite spin environments, from quadratic growth of the redundancy to oscillatory behavior. These
results will considerably simplify experimental testing of quantum Darwinism, e.g., using nitrogen
vacancies in diamond.

Quantum Darwinism is a framework that allows one
to understand the emergence of the objective, classical
world from within an ultimately quantum Universe [1, 2].
Objects decohere in the presence of their environment [3–
5], resulting in a mixture of pointer states. During this
process, the environment acts as an ampliﬁcation channel
[6], acquiring and transmitting redundant information
about the pointer states. This occurs via the imprinting
ˆs πˆs|ˆs(cid:105)(cid:104)ˆs|
onto conditional states, ρF|ˆs = (cid:104)ˆs|ρSF|ˆs(cid:105)/pˆs, of frag-
ments of the environment E, where ˆs = 1, . . . , DS label
the pointer states, pˆs are their probabilities, and ρSF is
the joint state of the system S and some fragment F.

The quantum mutual information

I (S : F) = HS + HF − HSF ,

(1)
where HA = −trρA log2 ρA is the von Neumann entropy,
quantiﬁes the correlations generated between the system
and the fragment. As was recently shown, it is a sum
of classical and quantum components [8], with the for-
mer being the Holevo quantity [9, 10] and the latter the
quantum discord [11–13]. The Holevo quantity [9],

bounds the amount of classical information transmittable
by a quantum channel. In our case, the classical infor-
mation is about the pointer states of the system and the
environment fragment’s state is the output of a quantum
channel. Redundant records are available when many
fragments of E contain information about S, i.e., when

is the missing information about S,
Here, HS = H
δ is the information deﬁcit (the information the observers
are prepared to forgo), and (cid:93)E is the total number of
subsystems in the environment. The average (cid:104)·(cid:105)(cid:93)Fδ is
taken over all choices of F with size (cid:93)Fδ.
The redundancy – the number of records of the infor-

mation – is just

Rδ = (cid:93)E/(cid:93)Fδ.

(4)

Redundancy allows many observers to independently ac-
cess information about a system [14, 15] and guarantees
that they will arrive at compatible conclusions about
its state. The presence of redundancy distinguishes the
preferred quantum states (that can aspire to classical-
ity) from the overwhelming majority of possible state in
Hilbert space [16–18] and explains the emergence of ob-
jective classical reality in a quantum universe.
We note that, in the context of our everyday experi-
ence, HS above is not the thermodynamic entropy of S.
Rather, it is usually the missing information about the
relevant degrees of freedom of S. This is an important
distinction: The thermodynamic entropy of a cat, for in-
stance, will vastly exceed the information the observer
is most interested in – the one bit of greatest interest in
the setting imagined by Schrödinger [19]. Moreover, only
such salient features of macrostates will usually be pre-
served or will evolve in a predictable manner under the
combined inﬂuence of the self-Hamiltonian and of the
decohering environment. The condition for the preser-
vation of macrostates under copying (or under monitor-
ing by, e.g., the environment – the cause of decoherence)
is the orthogonality of the subspaces that support such
macrostates [20].
It is reminiscent of the condition for
preservation of microstates under measurements [21], but
the degeneracy within macrostates allows for evolution

Figure 1: Record acquisition by an environment spin: Three-dimensional trajectories on the Bloch sphere that depict the
acquisition of a record by a single two-level (spin) environment subsystem. (a) A qubit system interacts with a spin environment
subsystem with ωk = 0. (See Eq. (5).) The two conditional states of an individual environment spin, ρk|↑ (green) and ρk|↓
(blue), rotate in opposite directions from the initial state (light blue sphere) due to interaction with the spin-up and spin-down
pointer states of the system. For pure states, the decoherence and completeness of the record is determined by the angle Θ
between the Bloch vectors for ρk|↑ and for ρk|↓ – the angle that appears in the quantum Chernoﬀ bound (QCB), Eq. (19). (b)
The same as (a), but with an initially mixed subsystem state. The mixedness contracts the Bloch vectors (here, to a length
a = 11/16) and reduces the ability of an environment spin to store distinguishable records of the system’s pointer states. (c)
Same as (a) but with a subsystem self-Hamiltonian, ωkσx
k /2. The latter contribution to the Hamiltonian can enhance
or reduce the susceptibility of the subsystem to be rotated by S, depending on the initial state, time, etc. While the case of
ωk = 0 gives analogous behavior to photons, the case of ωk (cid:54)= 0 is relevant for more general environments, such as the nuclear
spin environment of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) in diamond.

k = πσx

and even for the change of their thermodynamic entropy
(which would certainly occur in the example of the cat
we have just invoked).

To illustrate quantum Darwinism, we examine a deco-
hering qubit. In this case, the Hilbert space of the qubit
is of course too small to allow for the above distinction,
leaving no room for the thermodynamic entropy. We
take the interaction between the central qubit and the
environment to be the pure decoherence Hamiltonian

by taking a suitable average. In addition to giving exam-
ples of environments that are non-i.i.d. (not independent
and identically distributed) and the possibility of visual-
izing the acquisition of partial records, this class of spin
environments is the natural stepping-stone to ﬁnite, but
higher dimensional, models where the information trans-
ferred into the environment pertains to coarse-grained
observables of the system. Moreover, due to the preva-
lence of experimentally characterizable spin systems, the
models discussed here will help test the underlying ideas
of quantum Darwinism in a laboratory setting using, for
instance, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers [22–24].

Starting from the initial product state, the system and
the environment will become correlated as they interact.
Observers wanting to determine the pointer state of the
system, a σzS eigenstate in this case, need to distinguish
the messages contained in the intercepted fragment of E.
Evolution of the state, Eq. (6), generated by the Hamil-
tonian in Eq. (5) will result in the conditional states

For part of this work, we will assume an environment
with symmetric, time-independent couplings and initial
states (gk = g, ωk = ω, ρk (0) = ρr for all k). All ex-
pressions will be generalized to non-symmetric states and
non-symmetric (potentially, time-dependent) couplings

for ˆs =↑, ↓. The connection between the distinguishabil-
ity of these states and the Holevo quantity can be made

ωk = 0 & a = 1, (b) ωk = 0 & a = 11/16, and (c) ωk = π/2 & a = 1. (In all cases, t = 15π/64 and gk = 1/2.) These parameters
are the same as in Fig. 1. The white patches map a region of initial states of the spin, speciﬁed by (a, θ, φ) in the Bloch
sphere, to a region (ξQCB, θ, φ) of the central, toroidal structure. For the mixed state case, two patches are shown: (1, θ, φ)
in light pink and (a, θ, φ) in white. These structures demonstrate that there is only a single axis – an “insensitive axis” shown
as a dark purple arrow – of initial states that have no information transferred to them, and, consequently, do not contribute to
the redundancy. When ωk = 0, this axis is the z-axis – these states of the environment subsystem cannot decohere the system
and have zero susceptibility to acquire information. In a sense, they are the pointer states of the environment subsystem with
respect to decoherence induced by the system. For ωk (cid:54)= 0, the insensitive axis is time-dependent due to the intrinsic dynamics
of the environment. These structures show explicitly that redundancy is a universal feature of pure decoherence models; the
initial states that preclude the acquisition of a partial record form a set of measure zero. In other words, essentially all spins
in the environment will be imprinted with a partial record of the system’s state. (See Fig. 1 for an illustration of this process.)
These partial records can be therefore investigated experimentally by tomography of individual spins.

Chernoﬀ bound (QCB) shows that the error probability
in discriminating the two “sources” – here, the pointer
states – decays as

Pe ∼ exp(cid:0)−(cid:93)FξQCB

(cid:1)

(9)

in the asymptotic regime [26–28]. The decay rate of the
error is given by

(cid:104)

(cid:105)

ξQCB = − ln tr

(10)

which is the quantum Chernoﬀ information. The value of
c is that which maximizes this exponent and satisﬁes 0 ≤
c ≤ 1. The quantity ξQCB gives a generalized measure of
overlap between two states.

In quantum Darwinism the QCB provides the measure
of distinguishability, including the case of non-i.i.d. en-
vironment components [6]. Ampliﬁcation of information
about the pointer states is reﬂected in the rapid decay of
ignorance with the size of the fragment. Enforcing the
condition, Eq. (3), together with Fano’s inequality, Eq.
(8), gives an estimate for the redundancy [6]

Rδ (cid:39) (cid:93)E ¯ξQCB

.

(11)

This estimate stems from a lower bound on the redun-
dancy as δ → 0 [6]. The quantity ¯ξQCB is the “typical”
quantum Chernoﬀ information (for potentially non-i.i.d.
environments),

(12)

It characterizes the distinguishability averaged over con-
tributions of individual environment subsystems (i.e.,
fragments of size 1). Equation (12) can be maximized
over 0 ≤ c ≤ 1. This may not always be practical. We
shall see it can be done for spin environments. (Previ-
ously, we demonstrated it can be done for photon envi-
ronments [6].) Otherwise, though, the parameter c can
just be set to some value between 0 and 1, e.g., c = 1/2,
to get a weaker lower bound on the redundancy (and
the quantum Chernoﬀ information). As seen from Eqs.
(11) and (12), the distinguishability (alternatively, the
overlap) of the conditional states, ρk|↑ and ρk|↓ , of the
kth environment subsystem determines its contribution
to the QCB and the redundancy.

Equation (11) is an extraordinarily practical tool that
we will exploit in this work: To calculate the redundancy
(and, hence, the ampliﬁcation), one need only study indi-
vidual environment subsystems, rather than states in the

(a)(b)(c)exponentially large Hilbert space of the fragment. More-
over, the system’s probabilities appear only as small cor-
rections to Eq. (11) (except for the trivial case when p↑ is
zero or one). Thus, the quantity of interest is the typical
quantum Chernoﬀ information ¯ξQCB, which quantiﬁes
the distinguishability of the states of the environment.
This shifts the focus from the objective existence of the
state of the system to the redundancy – hence, accessi-
bility by many observers, the hallmark of objectivity – of
the records of its state in the environment. The forma-
tion and redundancy of these records depend on how the
environment responds to the presence of the system.

The quantum Chernoﬀ information allows one to arrive
at useful estimates of redundancy based on measurements
of only single subsystems of the environment rather than
tomography of whole fragments F, a task that is expo-
nentially diﬃcult in (cid:93)F. Although mathematical mod-
els of decoherence sometimes make strong assumptions
about the form of the interaction Hamiltonian, the key
prediction of these models – large redundancies – can be
tested experimentally without such assumptions. There-
fore, it is hoped that the results presented here will enable
testing of quantum Darwinism in the laboratory.

I. RESULTS

Here we set the stage by using the quantum Cher-
noﬀ information to investigate the transfer of informa-
tion between a qubit system and spins of the environ-
ment. Speciﬁcally, we obtain general formulas and then
use them to analyze paradigmatic examples of spin en-
vironments. We also elucidate the relation between the
QCB, redundancy, and decoherence.

A. Decoherence and Information

Focusing on an individual spin from the environment,
we now study the relation between decoherence and the
imprinting of a partial record. According to Eq. (5), the
interaction with the system imprints its ˆsth pointer state
on the kth subsystem, ρk|ˆs , by a controlled unitary, i.e.,
rotating it from its initial state to the state

ρk|ˆs = Vˆsρk (0)V†
ˆs ,

(13)

with

Vˆs = (cid:104)ˆs| exp (−ıHt)|ˆs(cid:105).

the decoherence factor, γ =(cid:81)

This process of controlled rotation is depicted in Fig. 1.
The oﬀ-diagonal elements of ρS (t) will be suppressed by

from each subsystem k. Each contribution to the QCB
is, ignoring the logarithm,

For a pure initial state (or a puriﬁed state where the
observer has access to the purifying system), we thus
have

¯ξQCB = − ln(cid:104)|γk|2(cid:105)1 = − ln(cid:104)cos2(Θ/2)(cid:105)1,

(16)

where the second equality is for spin environments and
the average (cid:104)·(cid:105)1 is over the individual components of the
environment, i.e., fragments of size (cid:93)F = 1. The angle
Θ is how much the conditional states of the environment
spin are separated on the Bloch sphere, as shown in Fig.
1. The redundancy is therefore

Rδ (cid:39) (cid:93)E ln(cid:104)cos2(Θ/2)(cid:105)1

ln δ

.

(17)

There is thus a direct correspondence between decoher-
ence and redundancy when the environment is initially
pure – when there is decoherence, records of the system’s
pointer states will be proliferated into the environment.
The estimate of Rδ using Eq. (11) comes from a lower
bound on the redundancy. However, in the case of an ini-
tially pure E state, Eq. (11), and hence Eq. (17), is exact
as δ → 0. This is easily shown by expansion of the mu-
tual information, as shown in the Methods. Any initial
mixedness in the relevant subspace of the environment
subsystem – in the space that acquires the record – will
decrease the information about S observers can deduce,
as we will now show.

B. The Quantum Chernoﬀ Information for Mixed

Environments

vironment, we examine tr
which appears in Eq. (12). Letting D = U†V†

This is symmetric about c = 1/2 and attains its mini-
mum there (and thus it maximizes Eq. (12)). For higher
dimensional environment subsystems the minimum will
not necessarily occur at c = 1/2, even for pure decoher-
ence. Further, without loss of generality, let ρk (0) be
along the z-axis of the Bloch sphere and D be a rotation
about an axis in the xy-plane. One then obtains

¯ξQCB = − ln(cid:2)(cid:104)1 − λ sin2 Θ/2(cid:105)1

quantities λ, Θ, etc., depend on the environment subsys-
tem k.

No External Field, ωk = 0: For ωk = 0 in the Hamil-

tonian (5), the QCB takes on the form

¯ξQCB = − ln(cid:2)(cid:104)1 − λ sin2 2gkt sin2 θ(cid:105)1

(cid:3) ,

(21)

where θ is the angle of the initial environment spin state
from the z-axis. Notice that the polar angle, φ, does not
appear in ¯ξQCB when no external ﬁeld is present, and
hence the QCB is rotationally symmetric about the z-
axis. This axis is special: It is insensitive to the state of
the system, as the z-states are eigenstates of the Hamil-
tonian and these states have zero capacity to acquire in-
formation (in some sense, they are the pointer states of
the environment spin [7]).

Figure 2(a,b) shows the QCB mapped from the Bloch
sphere for an initially pure and mixed environment spin.
The QCB forms a toroidal structure around the z-axis.
Only along this axis is the QCB zero. In other words,
all the possible initial states of the environment will pro-
liferate redundant information, except ones that have all
subsystems initially in z-eigenstates or mixtures thereof.
Redundancy is thus inevitable, as these structures show.

In this expression, we have used the eﬀective ﬁeld
k, felt by the environment spin.
The factors in the average depend on the initial state
and parameters describing the kth environment subsys-
1 − a2 is the same factor as in the case ωk =
0. The angle ˜θ (t) is the angle of the initial state of
the environment subsystem from the “insensitive axis”
at time t, which is deﬁned by the Bloch angles θ(cid:63) =
arctan [±ωk tan (˜ωkt) /˜ωk] and φ(cid:63) = π ∓ π/2 (i.e., it de-
pends on the time and parameters of the kth environ-
ment subsystem’s Hamiltonian). When the environment
subsystem initially points in the direction of this axis,
then at time t it will contain no information and there-
fore will have zero contribution to the redundancy. This
(time-dependent) axis is thus the counterpart to the z-
axis when ωk = 0.

Figures 1(c) and 2(c) show the acquisition of a record
and ¯ξQCB for ω = π/2, respectively. While the behavior
is diﬀerent – the “toroids” rotate – one still gets redun-
dancy. The shape is also still highly symmetric. This
is clear from the expression, Eq. (22), above: At any
given time, the object is rotationally symmetric about
the axis deﬁned by θ(cid:63) and φ(cid:63). Thus, Eq. (22) shows

5

that the Hamiltonian deﬁnes a unique structure on the
Bloch sphere of individual environment spins. The spa-
tial extent of the structure determines the redundancy
achievable by states on E, and there is always a zero
point deﬁned by the “insensitive axis”, around which the
structure is also rotationally symmetric. Moreover, this
demonstrates that redundancy is not fragile in the sense
of being prohibited by self-Hamiltonians of the individ-
ual environment spins. Although the ﬁeld ωσx can in-
terfere with the ability of the environment to decohere
the system, the structures in Fig. 2 show that ﬁelds
can actually enhance the ability of some states to both
decohere the system and acquire information about it.
Of course, if the ﬁeld is strong enough, the environment
spin’s state rotates so fast that it decouples, so it will
neither decohere nor acquire information about the sys-
tem (this can be seen from Eq. (23), limω→∞ f (t) = 0,
giving limω→∞ Rδ = 0). Again, this shows that only in
particular cases – cases of measure zero – can redundancy
vanish.

C. Examples

The general results presented above set the stage for a
direct application of the QCB to example spin environ-
ments. They display a variety of behaviors for the redun-
dancy and the acquisition of records about the system’s
state. Here we will discuss natural spin environments
relevant to bringing quantum Darwinism into the lab.

1. Gaussian Decoherence and Rδ ∝ t2

Spin/two-level environments typically arise in solid
state systems where a central system, such as another
spin, interacts with many environment spins/two-level
systems with a bounded total energy. Decoherence in
this paradigmatic setting was studied in Refs.
[29–31],
where it was shown that this universally results in Gaus-
sian decoherence. In this situation, the Hamiltonian is
Eq. (5) and the coupling constants are assumed to de-
pend on the environment size as
k = G2/(cid:93)E,
g2

(24)
with G implicitly dependent on k. We note that the cou-
pling constants do not actually need to depend on en-
vironment size to get Gaussian behavior. However, this
dependence is physical (and also makes a short time ap-
proximation unnecessary). We will set ωk = 0 for con-
venience. The decoherence factor of the system decays
as

|γ|2 ∼ exp(cid:2)−t2/τ 2

(cid:3) ,

D

(25)

where τD is the decoherence time. This can be derived
using already demonstrated results.

Taking the relation between the QCB and the deco-

herence factor for pure states, Eq. (16), we can write

|γ|2 (cid:39)(cid:68)|γk|2(cid:69)(cid:93)E

1

= e− ¯ξQCB

(cid:93)E ,

(26)

where the ﬁrst approximate equality becomes exact in the
limit (cid:93)E → ∞ since |γk|2 approaches 1 with corrections
that can be written in a series in 1/(cid:93)E. The ¯ξQCB is given
by Eq. (21) by letting the environment be pure (λ = 1),

¯ξQCB = − ln(cid:2)(cid:104)1 − sin2 (2gkt) sin2 θ(cid:105)1

(cid:3)

≈ (cid:104)4G2t2 sin2 θ(cid:105)1/(cid:93)E,

(24) and assumed that (cid:93)E is
where we have used Eq.
very large. Again, all environment parameters implicitly
depend on k. Equation (26) now becomes Eq. (25) with

This is the same result as in Refs. [29–31] taking into ac-

Hamiltonian is deﬁned in Refs.
[29–31] as gk/2 and
sin2 θ = 4 sin2 (θ/2) cos2 (θ/2) = 4|α|2 |β|2, with implicit
k dependence). Note that for a mixed state environment
with the same (cid:104)4G2 sin2 θ(cid:105)1 , the decoherence time will
be the same, i.e., the decoherence – in contrast to ampli-
ﬁcation and, hence, redundancy – is independent of the
mixedness of the environment.

where α = (cid:104)λ(cid:105)1 is a spin analog of receptivity (gen-
erally, receptivity is just a proportionality factor be-
tween the redundancy and the decoherence factor, α =
, see below). This indicates that

redundancy grows quadratically with time. Moreover,
for (cid:93)E → ∞, redundancy grows indeﬁnitely and without
bound, even though the interaction energy between the
system spin and the inﬁnite environment is bounded. Fi-
nite environments have similar behavior except there is
a time (determined by the inverse of the typical inter-
action strength between the system and an environment
spin), beyond which information partially ﬂows back into
the system. Figure 3 shows the growth of redundancy
with time for both ﬁnite and (eﬀectively) inﬁnite envi-
ronments. Figure 4 shows the redundancy for initially
mixed environments plotted with the results found using
numerically exact techniques for ﬁnite (cid:93)Fδ. This ﬁgure

Figure 3: The redundancy vs. time for Gaussian decoherence
with an initially pure environment. Here, the couplings G are
chosen uniformly from the interval [−2, 2], which gives τD =
√
3/4. The other parameters are p↑ = 1/2 and δ = 10−16.
The blue squares are from computing the Holevo quantity
with very large environments and the black line is the QCB
result, Eq. (29). The green star is the redundancy onset time,
Eq. (30). The three black dashed lines are for diﬀerent ﬁnite
(cid:93)E (for a ﬁxed realization of the random coupling constants).
√
For ﬁnite environments, there is a quadratic growth of the
(cid:93)E, where there is
a partial ﬂow of information from the environment back into
the system. This time for each of the ﬁnite environments
is indicated by the black dotted lines. Thus, even for ﬁnite
environments, one can expect to see signatures of Gaussian
behavior in the redundancy.

redundancy up the time, π/4(cid:112)(cid:104)g2

shows that the exact results approach the QCB as δ gets
smaller ((cid:93)Fδ gets bigger).
In addition to the long time behavior for very large (cid:93)E,
we can also determine when redundant records start to
form. From Eq. (29), the onset of redundancy, Rδ ∼ 2,
happens at

(cid:112)2 ln 1/δ.

t(cid:63) = τD

(30)

That is, it is essentially the decoherence time multiplied
by a factor weakly dependent on the information deﬁcit
δ. The latter is order one for a large range of information
deﬁcits δ. Figure 3 marks this onset time with a green
star.

Before we discuss another example, we note that the
quadratic growth in the redundancy is in sharp contrast
to its linear growth for photon environments [6, 32–34].
Photons (or photon-like environments) are also amenable
to calculations using the QCB [6]. In this case, the re-
dundancy grows as

Rδ (cid:39) αt/τD
ln 1/δ

,

(31)

where α is the receptivity of the environment to making
records, which is a dimensionless quantity determined by

the mixedness and angular distribution of the incoming
photon states [6, 32–34]. The growth of the redundancy
for photons is due to the linear increase of the environ-
ment size in time, with each individual environment com-
ponent (each photon) acquiring a partial record of ﬁxed
ﬁdelity, at least on average.

This is in contrast to the spin environment which has
a ﬁxed size and continuously interacts with the system.
The quadratic growth in redundancy for spins is due to
the increasing ﬁdelity of the partial records with time.
We will show elsewhere [35] that a ﬂux of spins can rep-
resent the same acquisition of information as photon en-
vironments – and thus be used as a stand-in for photons.
We note that there is a receptivity for both spins and
photons. However, for spins it is simply α = (cid:104)λ(cid:105)1. Other
factors that aﬀect the ability of the environment spins to
acquire information also aﬀect their ability to decohere
the system. This diﬀerent form of the receptivity is due to
the fact that we have not made the equivalent of a “weak
scattering” approximation, but rather have only made a
weak coupling approximation for each environment spin
and have allowed each spin to continuously interact with
the system.

2. Other Non-i.i.d. Environments

The Gaussian decoherence case above is not the only
possible realization of a central spin continually interact-
ing with a ﬁxed set of spins. When a large number of
environment spins couple strongly to the system, then
one can have still diﬀerent behavior. Consider, for in-
stance, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (5) with ωk = 0 and the
coupling constants gk randomly drawn from the interval
[0, W ], with W the “bandwidth”. The QCB result, Eq.
(11), readily yields

tum Chernoﬀ information. Here, the ampliﬁcation is taken
relative to a reference case, R(cid:63) ≡ limδ→0 Rδ/R(cid:48)

predicts that the relative eﬃciency is ξQCB/ξ(cid:48)
QCB with ξQCB
from Eq. (19) (black, dotted lines). The quadratic growth of
the redundancy, given by Eq. (29), is shown as black, solid
lines. For all data, the QCB prediction and quadratic growth
match well with the numerically computed results. For very
small relative eﬃciencies there is some deviation, which is due
to the ﬁnite (cid:93)Fδ obtainable numerically. The full QCB result
deviates from quadratic behavior for very long times (i.e., on
the order of the recurrence time of an individual spin inter-
(cid:93)E). The data in the ﬁgure

is as follows: The ﬁve lines are for varying haziness (the ini-
tial entropy h = H [(1 + a) /2] of a single environment spin
[36, 37]) h = 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, and 4/5 from top to bottom.

II. DISCUSSION

by averaging 1 − λ sin2 2gkt sin2 θ over the coupling con-
stants assuming that λ and θ are constant. Figure 5
shows the QCB result for the redundancy compared with
the results from averaging the Holevo quantity. As δ is
decreased, the numerical results converge to the QCB
result. Notice that the environment spins have a band
of energies, which is responsible for both the oscillation
frequency and decay.
In this setting – environment spins strongly coupled to
the system – E will often have only a ﬁnite number of
spins, i.e., (cid:93)E can not be taken to be inﬁnite. The qual-
itative features given by the QCB, however, will still be
present in the redundancy even for relatively small num-
ber of spins in the environment, as shown in the inset
of Fig. 5. Therefore, one can expect that in some set-
tings, more intricate dynamics of the redundancy will be
present.

The QCB demonstrates that redundancy is inevitable
under pure decoherence: The only way to avoid it for
a spin environment is for all spins to be in a completely
mixed state (i.e., a = 0, implying λ = 0) or for all spins to
be precisely aligned with the insensitive axis (i.e., Θ = 0).
Figure 2 shows this graphically. Pure decoherence always
gives rise to the redundant proliferation of information
except in rare – measure zero – cases. Furthermore, we
showed that the redundancy using the QCB estimate,
Eq. (11), agrees with numerically exact results, which
covers a wide variety of behavior from Gaussian deco-
herence to oscillations. We discuss further examples in a
forthcoming publication [35].

Although unavoidable imperfections ensure that real-
world systems rarely undergo pure decoherence, Eq. (5),
models like the one in Ref. [18] show that redundancy
emerges even in the presence of other types of environ-
mental interactions. The results presented here will help

a classical objective reality in our quantum Universe is
inescapable [6, 38].

III. METHODS

(cid:16) ˆΠS : F(cid:17)

The numerical computation in Fig. 3 are for a sym-
metric environment with θ = π/2 and gk = 1 for all k
in order to make use of the method of Refs.
[36, 37].
√
Since gk = 1 for all k, the decoherence time is τD = 1/2,
(cid:93)E will be zero for all prac-
which when rescaled by 1/
tical purposes (and well oﬀ the scale of the ﬁgure). We
note that R(cid:63) is found numerically by ﬁtting the decay of
HS − χ
in order to more rapidly approach the
(cid:93)Fδ → ∞ (δ → 0) limit. The numerical technique is exact
for the computation of the Holevo quantity, χ (ΠS : F),
for ﬁnite (cid:93)Fδ. Even though the QCB is the asymptotic re-
sult ((cid:93)Fδ → ∞), the numerical and analytical data match.
The data for Fig. 5 are calculated as follows: The ref-
erence case is evaluated at t → ∞. The environment is
taken to be pure. The numerical data (open blue squares)
was found by sampling the random distribution of spins
108 times to obtain δ as a function of (cid:93)F. The solid
black curve is the QCB, Eq. (32) and the dashed black
curve is from the expansion of the Holevo quantity (see
the following paragraph below). The dashed green curve
is Gaussian decoherence regime, giving R(cid:63) ∝ t2. The
information deﬁcit, δ = 10−10, is still ﬁnite and thus
there is a gap between the QCB and the exact results,
which closes as δ becomes smaller. Note that the ac-
tual redundancy is quite large, linear in the environment
size. For the inset, the numerical data was evaluated
using an exact average of the Holevo quantity over all
subsets of size (cid:93)Fδ of the (cid:93)E = 32 spins for a ﬁxed re-
alization of the random coupling constants. The dis-
cretized application of the QCB takes Rδ = (cid:93)E/(cid:100)(cid:93)F c
δ(cid:101),
where (cid:93)F c
tinuous (cid:93)Fδ and where the average is over the single re-
alization of random coupling constants. The redundancy
jumps between discrete steps since (cid:93)Fδ takes on integer
values, e.g., Rδ = 16 is for (cid:93)Fδ = 2 and Rδ = 32/3 ≈ 10
for (cid:93)Fδ = 3, etc.

δ = ln δ/ ln(cid:2)(cid:104)1 − λ sin2 2gkt sin2 θ(cid:105)1

(cid:3) is a con-

For a pure system and environment, and a decoher-
ence process due to the Hamiltonian in Eq.
(5), the
mutual information is given by I (S : F) = HSdF (t) +

(cid:2)HSdE (t) − HSd(E/F )(t)(cid:3) [37], with the term in square

brackets being the quantum discord [8, 37], and the
Holevo quantity by χ (ΠS : F) = HSdF (t). Here, the
entropies are the entropy of the system only decohered
by some component of the environment, either F, E,
or E/F. These expressions can both be generalized to
the case of the system being mixed, see Eq.
(A13) of
Ref. [37]. Expanding HSdF (t), inputing it into Eq. (3),
and using that (cid:93)E (cid:29) (cid:93)Fδ – so that each of the spins in
the fragment can be treated independently in the av-
erage – gives Rδ = (cid:93)E ln(cid:104)cos2 Θ/2(cid:105)1/ (ln δ + ln C) with
C = HS (p↑ − p↓) ln 2/ (p↑p↓ ln p↑/p↓). C → ln 4 for

δ. The
plot shows the numerical data (blue squares), QCB (black
solid line), Gaussian regime (green dashed line), and an ap-
proximation that has corrections for ﬁnite δ (black dashed
line). The red dashed line is the t → ∞ result. When the cou-
pling constants gk come from a band of energies, [0, 1], the ef-
ﬁciency of ampliﬁcation initially increases quadratically with
time – i.e., it is in the universally present Gaussian regime
– and then develops into an oscillatory behavior. The oscil-
lations appear due to drawing the coupling constants from a
ﬁnite band. The inset shows Rδ for (cid:93)E = 32 and δ = 10−1 for
a single set of spins with random coupling constants drawn
from [0, 1]. The exact numerical data, the open blue squares,
shows that the oscillatory features are still present even for
this small environment. Moreover, the black line shows a dis-
cretized application of the QCB. This shows that in potential
experiments with a very limited number of subsystems of the
environment can still display intricate dynamics of the redun-
dancy and the emergence of objective information. Moreover,
the QCB can capture this behavior and thus eliminate the
need for a full tomographic characterization of the system
and environment. The Methods section gives details of the
data in the ﬁgure.

shed light on experiments where decoherence and ampliﬁ-
cation are expected to occur for spins, such as NV-centers
immersed in an environment of nuclear spins. While the
QCB gives the exact asymptotic redundancy for the mod-
els here, two key features of the estimate, Eq.
(11),
are that (a) it does not rely on idealized initial states
or Hamiltonians when considered as a lower bound and
(b) it can be computed using only individual spin mea-
surements, with no need for complicated multipartite to-
mography. Thus, whether a system self-Hamiltonian is
present or not, and whether there are more complicated
interactions, one can demonstrate information transfer
into the environment with experimentally feasible mea-
surements. Our results, especially when conﬁrmed ex-
perimentally, further elucidate the acquisition of infor-
mation by the environment and show why perception of

p↑ = p↓ = 1/2. This equation is, for any practical δ, ex-
act and shows that the redundancy approaches the QCB
result from above as δ → 0. This equation is the black
dashed line in Fig. 5.
