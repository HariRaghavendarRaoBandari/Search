Quantum communication has historically been at the forefront of advancements, from funda-

mental tests of quantum physics to utilizing the quantum-mechanical properties of physical

systems for practical applications1,2. In the ﬁeld of communication complexity3, quantum

1

communication allows the advantage of an exponential reduction in the information trans-

mitted over classical communication to accomplish distributed computational tasks4,5. How-

ever, to date, demonstrating this advantage in a practical setting continues to be a central

challenge5–9. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a quantum ﬁngerprinting

protocol that for the ﬁrst time surpasses the ultimate classical limit to transmitted infor-

mation. Ultra-low noise superconducting single-photon detectors and a stable ﬁbre-based

Sagnac interferometer are used to implement a quantum ﬁngerprinting system that is ca-

pable of transmitting less information than the classical proven lower bound over 20 km

standard telecom ﬁbre for input sizes of up to two Gbits. The results pave the way for ex-

perimentally exploring the advanced features of quantum communication and open a new

window of opportunity for research in communication complexity and testing the founda-

tions of physics5.

Quantum-communication network10 is believed to be the next-generation platform for re-

mote information processing tasks. So far, however, only one protocol – quantum key distribution

(QKD)2 – has been widely investigated and deployed in commercial applications. The extension of

the practically available quantum communication protocols beyond QKD in order to fully under-

stand the potential of large-scale quantum communication networks is therefore highly important.

Signiﬁcant progress has been made in this direction11–16, but the rich class of quantum communi-

cation complexity (QCC) protocols3–5 remains largely undemonstrated, except for a few proof-of-

principle implementations6–9. The ﬁeld of QCC explores quantum-mechanical properties in order

to determine the minimum amount of information that must be transmitted to solve distributed

2

computational tasks4. It not only has many connections to the foundational issues of quantum

mechanics5, 17, but also has important applications for the design of communication systems, green

communication techniques, computer circuits and data structures18. For instance, QCC essentially

connects the foundational physics questions regarding nonlocality with those of communication

complexity studied in theoretical computer science5.

Quantum ﬁngerprinting, proposed by Buhrman, Cleve, Watrous and Wolf, is the most ap-

pealing protocol in QCC19. Speciﬁcally, the simultaneous message-passing model3 corresponds to
the scenario where two parties, Alice and Bob, respectively receive inputs xa, xb ∈ {0, 1}n and

send messages to a third party, Referee, who must determine whether xa equals xb or not, with a

small error probability . This model has two requirements: (i) Alice and Bob do not have access

to shared randomness; (ii) there is one-way communication to Referee only. Alice and Bob can

achieve their goal by sending ﬁngerprints of their original inputs that are much shorter than the

original inputs. It has been shown that the optimal classical protocols require ﬁngerprints of a
√
length that is at least O(
n)21, 22, while, using quantum communication, Alice and Bob need to
send ﬁngerprints of only O(log n) qubits19, 20. Therefore, when the goal is to reduce the transmit-

ted information, quantum communication provides an exponential improvement over the classical

case. Despite this advantage, demonstrating it in a practical setting continues to be a challenge5.

Recently, a coherent-state quantum ﬁngerprinting protocol for the realization using linear op-

tics was proposed by Arrazola and L¨utkenhaus23. On the basis of this protocol, Xu et al. reported

a proof-of-concept implementation that transmits less information than the best known classical

3

protocol9. Nonetheless, as noted already in ref.9, a remaining question is “whether quantum ﬁn-

gerprinting can beat the classical theoretical limit of transmitted information.” This limit has been

proven to be roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the best known classical protocol22,

and surpassing it has been a long-standing experimental challenge. In this work, a quantum ﬁn-

gerprinting system is designed and demonstrated that for the ﬁrst time beats the classical limit to

transmitted information by up to 84%.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the experiment adopted the coherent-state quantum ﬁngerprinting

protocol23. The detailed description of the protocol is presented in Table 1. It has been proven

that the quantum information Q that can be transmitted by sending the sequence of weak coherent

states satisﬁes23

Q = O(µ log2 n),

(1)

where µ is deﬁned as the total mean photon number in the entire pulse sequence. An important

feature of the protocol is to ﬁx µ to a small constant, which restricts the transmitted information

(see Methods for details). For a ﬁxed µ, Q corresponds to an exponential improvement over the
classical case of O(

√
n) bits21, 22, which precisely provides the quantum advantage.

To implement the coherent-state quantum ﬁngerprinting protocol, the experiment utilizes a

ﬁbre-based Sagnac-type interferometer, as sketched in Fig. 2 (see Methods for the details). In this

set-up, since the two pulses, sent from Referee to Alice and Bob, travel exactly the same path in

the interferometer, two remarkable features are automatic compensation of the phase differences

between the two pulses and high interference visibility. In experiment, one challenge is that Alice

4

(Bob) should ensure that her (his) phase modulator (PM) modulate only the signal pulse, i.e., the

one that returns from Bob (Alice), instead of the compensation pulse, i.e., the pulse that is sent

directly from Referee. To do so, speciﬁc lengths of ﬁbres and electrical cables are designed to sep-

arate the signal pulse from compensation pulse with 20 ns difference, and to carefully control the

electrical gating signals applied to the PMs. Another challenge is that the coherent-state quantum

ﬁngerprinting protocol23 requires the operation of the system at an ultra-low mean photon number,

which is well below 10−7 per pulse. Indeed, as can be deduced from Eq. (1), a lower mean photon

number leads to a reduction in the transmitted information, which permits the demonstration of

beating the classical limit. To properly detect such a weak signal, advanced SNSPDs with on-chip

narrow-band-pass ﬁlters25, 26 are installed. These SNSPDs have an ultra-low dark count rate of

about 0.11 Hz and a high quantum efﬁciency of 45.6% at 1532nm wavelength.

To surpass the classical limit, the losses should be carefully controlled. The overall trans-

mittance of Referee’s PBS and BS is 80.16% (78.5%) from Alice (Bob) to Referee. The system

is implemented with total distances (from Alice to Bob) of 0 km, 10 km and 20 km ﬁbre spools,

whose losses are characterised to be about 0 dB, 1.86 dB and 3.92 dB respectively. The distances

between Alice (or Bob) and the referee are 0 km, 5 km and 10 km. Under each distance, ﬁve
different message sizes n are chosen as 2 × 106, 4 × 107, 1.42 × 108, 1 × 109, and 2 × 109. For

each message, an ECC is applied based on the Toeplitz-matrices random linear code9, which has

a rate of R = 0.24 and a minimum distance of δ = 0.22. The random numbers to construct the

matrices are generated from a quantum random number generator27. Here for a message up to

two Gbits, the system requires several hours to transmit the pulses. Hence, a stable interference

5

is essential for the experiment. The stability of the system is monitored, and the result is that,

during 24 hours of continuous operation, the overall intensity ﬂuctuations are less than 3.7% and

the interference visibility remains over 96%. In the experiment, the key observation parameter is

the number of counts on detector D1. These experimental results are shown in Fig. 3. The clear

difference between the worst-case different inputs with δ = 0.22 difference (blue points) and the

identical inputs (red points) makes it possible to run the protocol (see Table 1). In all the runs of
experiments, a maximal error probability of  = 2.6 × 10−5 (See Supplementary) was achieved.

The maximum error probability was calculated from the theoretical model of the experiment9, 23.

Fig. 4a shows the experimental transmitted information at 0 km (red data points) and 20 km

(black data points) for different message sizes. The error bars come from the uncertainty in the es-

timation of the mean photon number µ. In this ﬁgure, our quantum ﬁngerprinting is compared with

the classical limit (solid-orange curve) and the best known classical protocol (dashed-blue curve).

√
The best known classical protocol needs to transmit at least 32

n bits of information22. On the ba-

sis of the references21, 22, we prove an optimized bound for the classical limit (see Supplementary)1.

This bound is given by

Fig. 4a indicates that, with the increase of input size n, the classical limit scales linearly in the

log-log plot, while the transmitted quantum information remains almost a constant. The trans-

proved independently by Dave Touchette, Juan Miguel Arrazola and Norbert L¨utkenhaus, who will post their results

soon.

mitted information is up to two orders of magnitude lower than that in the previous experiment9.

Importantly, for large n, these experimental results clearly beat the classical limit for a wide range

of practical values of the input size. To further illustrate our results, γ is deﬁned as the ratio be-

tween the classical limit Climit and the transmitted quantum information Q, i.e., γ = Climit/Q. A

value γ > 1 implies that the classical limit is surpassed by our quantum ﬁngerprinting protocol.

In Fig. 4b, γ is plotted as a function of different ﬁbre distances and input data sizes. For the input

sizes larger than one Gbit, γ is well above one. The ratio is as large as γ = 1.84, which implies

that our quantum ﬁngerprinting implementation beats the classical limit by up to 84%.

Finally, to show the ability of the quantum protocol in the real world, two video ﬁles with

sizes of two Gbits28 were experimentally ﬁngerprinted over 20 km ﬁbre. A 14% reduction in the

transmitted information was obtained, as compared to the classical limit (see Supplementary Table

4 for details).

To conclude, by using ultra-low dark count superconducting detectors (i.e., ∼ 0.1 Hz), as

well as an automatic-phase compensation Sagnac system, a quantum-enhanced method for ﬁnger-
printing to beat the ultimate classical theoretical limit was demonstrated. With ∼1300 transmitted
photons as the information carrier, two ∼2 Gbits video ﬁles were experimentally ﬁngerprinted over

20 km ﬁbres, and the potential for practical applications was thus indicated. In the future, our sys-

tem can be deployed in the metropolitan ﬁbre network for a ﬁeld test. Higher detection efﬁciency

SNSPDs29 can be exploited to increase the transmission distance and reduce the required mes-

sage length. Alice and Bob can also hold independent laser sources and apply the phase-locking

7

techniques to interfere the weak coherent pulses. Last but not least, we point that many con-

nections between communication complexity and foundational issues of quantum mechanics have

been recently discovered5. In particular, quantum communication complexity is intimately linked

to quantum nonlocality. Our experiment provides a ﬁrst step in the development of experimental

quantum communication complexity, which could even lead new proposals for experiments that

test the foundations of physics.

Here E(xa)j (E(xb)j) is the jth binary bit of Alice’s (Bob’s) codeword, α is a complex amplitude,

and θj – which is assumed to be the same for Alice and Bob – is the global phase of jth pulse. We
deﬁne µ := |α|2 as the total mean photon number in the entire pulse sequence. The states of Eq. (3)

can be understood as a coherent-state version of an encoding of m-dimensional quantum states into

states of a single photon across m modes23. Importantly, by ﬁxing µ to a small constant, we are

restricting ourselves to an exponentially small subspace of the larger Hilbert space associated with

the optical modes. This in turn restricts the capability of these systems to transmit information.

Thus, to achieve the central goal of a reduction in the transmitted information, our protocol must

8

use a number of modes that is linear in the input size n, with the signiﬁcant advantage that the

total mean photon number µ is very small.

In particular, the number of photons used is more

√
than quadratically smaller than in a classical protocol using photonic bits, where O(

n) photons

are needed compared to O(1) photons in the quantum case. This quantum advantage essentially

provides an exponential improvement over the classical case.

Experimental details. The laser source at Referee emits weak coherent pulses with 300

ps pulse-width at 1532 nm, which are ﬁltered by a tunable band-pass ﬁlter (BPF) to suppress the

spontaneous emission noise. The repetition rate of the pulsed laser is 25 MHz. In this rate, the

spontaneous emission noise is about 10 dB lower than the signal, while this noise is suppressed

down to 40 dB by the BPF. The pulses are separated by a 50/50 beam splitter (BS) into two

pulses: one pulse is measured by a power meter to monitor the light intensity and the other one

– which is called the encoding pulse – is injected into the interferometer. The encoding pulse is

ﬁrst attenuated and separated again at a polarization-maintaining BS into left pulse and right pulse.

Note that this polarization-maintaining BS allows only the light with slow-axis polarization to pass

through. We deﬁne this polarization as H. The left pulse passes through a polarization beam

splitter (PBS) and travels to Alice over a ﬁber spool. Alice uses a polarization controller (PC) to

compensate the polarization rotation (or drift) of the ﬁber spool that connects to her. After the

polarization compensation, the pulse travels out from the H port of Alice’s PBS, passes through a

phase modulator (PM) without any modulations and returns to the PBS from its V port. When the

pulse returns to Referee, the polarization of the pulse has been rotated to V. Hence the pulse passes

through the V port of referee’s PBS and travels to Bob. Note that the pulse travelling from Alice

9

to Bob does not contain any information about Alice’s codeword. This guarantees that there is no

communication between Alice and Bob. Bob uses his PC to compensate the polarization rotation

of the ﬁber spool that connects from the referee to him. Once the pulse passes through Bob’s PM

from his PBS’s V port, Bob modulates the phase of the pulse according to his codeword E(xb).

Similarly, the right pulse from the referee travels to Bob for a polarization compensation ﬁrst

and then goes to Alice for encoding according to Alice’s codeword E(xa). Finally, the left pulse

and the right pulse return simultaneously at Referee’s polarization maintaining BS, where they

interfere and are detected by two superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In

front of the SNSPD, PC is used to optimize the detection efﬁciency. A time-to-digital converter

records all the detected events and a 2.5 ns effective time window is used to detect the pulses.

The electric signals that control the optical devices are generated from a AWG70002 waveform

generator (manufactured by Tektronix).

Figure 1: (Colour online) A schematic illustration of the coherent-state quantum ﬁngerprinting

protocol. Alice and Bob use their input digital bits to modulate the phases of a sequence of weak

coherent pulses and they send the sequence to Referee over two quantum channels. The incoming

signals interfere at a beam-splitter (BS), and photons are detected in the output by two detectors

D0 and D1.

14

Alice Bob Referee D0 D1 BS 1. Preparation. Alice applies an error-correcting code (ECC) to her input xa of n bits and generates a codeword

E(xa) of m = n/R bits, with R indicating the rate of ECC. Then she prepares a sequence of m weak

coherent pulses and uses the codeword to modulate the phase of each pulse. The sequence of coherent

states can be understood as a coherent version of the encoding of a single photon across m modes. Bob

completes a process that is the same as Alice’s for his input xb.

2. Distribution. Both Alice and Bob send their pulse trains to the Referee over two quantum channels. By

using a phase interferometer, Referee interferes the individual pulses in a balanced beam-splitter (BS)

and observes the clicks at the outputs of the BS, using two single-photon detectors, which are labelled

“D0” and “D1”. This process allows Referee to verify whether the relative phases of the incoming pulses

are same or different24. In an ideal situation, a click in detector D1 will never happen if the phases of the

incoming states are equal.

3. Decision. In the presence of experimental imperfections such as detector dark counts and imperfect interfer-

ence, detector D1 may ﬁre even when the inputs are equal. However, in a case of small imperfections, the

total number of clicks on D1 for different inputs is much larger than the total number of clicks for equal

inputs. A decision rule for Referee is employed on the basis of only the total number of clicks observed

in detector D1

9. Referee sets a threshold value D1,th such that, if the number of clicks is smaller than or

equal to D1,th, he will conclude that the inputs are equal. Otherwise, he concludes that they are different.

In the protocol, the value of D1,th is chosen in such a way that an error is equally likely to occur in both

cases.
