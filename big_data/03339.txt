Abstract

We prove that the ﬁxed points of the curved 3-body problem and their associated
relative equilibria are Lyapunov stable if the solutions are restricted to S1, but un-
stable if the bodies are considered in S2.

Key words: celestial mechanics; curved 3-body problem; ﬁxed-point solutions; rel-
ative equilibria; stability.

Introduction

The curved 3-body problem is a natural extension of the classical 3-body problem to
spaces of constant nonzero Gaussian curvature. Its history, which started with Bolyai
and Lobachevsky, is outlined in [1], where it is also shown that, in the 2-dimensional
case, the study of the problem can be reduced to the unit sphere, S2, and the unit
hyperbolic sphere, H2. The equations of motion can be written as a Hamiltonian
system in extrinsic coordinates with holonomic constraints in the Euclidean space,
for positive curvature, but in the Minkowski space, for negative curvature. This
formulation led to fruitful results, especially in the study of symmetric motions, [1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16].

One class of solutions are the ﬁxed points, which occur only on spheres, [1, 2]. We
study here their stability as well as that of their associated relative equilibria for the
3-body problem on S1 and S2. Fixed points are critical points of the force function
that deﬁnes the system on the conﬁguration space. For the bodies m1, m2, m3, they
give rise to periodic relative equilibria, which in spherical coordinates (φ, θ) have the
form

θi(t) = θi, ϕi(t) = ϕi + ωt,

i ∈ {1, 2, 3},

˙θi = 0,

˙ϕi = ω,

for any ω (cid:54)= 0. There have been some previous studies of the stability of orbits in the
curved 3- and 4-body problem, [7, 9], but none of them considered ﬁxed points, so
this appears to be a ﬁrst attempt in this direction.

For ﬁxed points of the 3-body problem on S2, the masses must lie on a great
circle of S2 at the vertices of an acute triangle, [1]. In Section 2, we prove a general
criterion for the existence of ﬁxed points for n > 2 masses. It is known that not all
masses can form ﬁxed points, [4], and in Section 3 we ﬁnd all mass triples that do
so. In Section 4, we investigate the stability of ﬁxed points and of their associated
relative equilibria on S1. Since the associated relative equilibria are periodic orbits,
their stability is deﬁned as the stability of the corresponding rest points of the ﬂow in
the reduced phase space, [13]. To perform the reduction, we use coordinates similar
to the Jacobi coordinates of the classical n-body problem. By showing that the
corresponding rest points are maxima of the force function, we prove that the ﬁxed
points and the associated relative equilibria are Lyapunov stable on S1. In Section
5, we show that these solutions are unstable on S2. Their stability is deﬁned as
the stability of the corresponding rest points of the linearized system restricted to
a proper linear subspace. Using an idea from the work of Rick Moeckel, [10], we
determine this proper linear subspace and prove the instability of the solutions by
ﬁnding the normal form of the Jacobian matrix on the subspace we found.

2 Existence of ﬁxed points on S1
The goal of this section is to introduce the curved n-body problem on S2, deﬁne a
class of orbits we call ﬁxed points, and provide a criterion for the existence of these
solutions for any number n > 2 of point masses.

A Hamiltonian system is given by the triple (H, M, w), where M is an even dimen-
sional manifold, w is a symplectic form on M , and H is an inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable,
real-valued function on M . The curved n-body problem on S2, n ≥ 2, is given by a
Hamiltonian system (H, M, w) as follows. Let m1, . . . , mn be a system of n positive
point masses (bodies), whose conﬁguration is given by the vector

q = (q1,··· , qn) ∈ (S2)n,

with qi = (xi, yi, zi) = (sin θi cos ϕi, sin θi sin ϕi, cos θi) in spherical coordinates (ϕi, θi),
i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. We denote by dij the geodesic distance between the point masses mi
and mj, i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The kinetic energy has the form

and the conjugate momenta are given by

i=1

pθi = mi ˙θi, pϕi = mi sin2 θi ˙ϕi, i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

The conﬁguration space is W = (S2)n \ ∆, where ∆ is the singularity set,
∆ := {q ∈ (S2)n : ∃(i, j) with i (cid:54)= j such that dij = 0 or dij = π}.

is given by

mimj cot dij.

1≤i<j≤n

Let d denote the diﬀerential, V = −U be the force function, and T ∗W represent the
cotangent bundle of W . Then the curved n-body problem on S2 is described by the
Hamiltonian system

H = T + U = T − V, M = T ∗W, w = d

pθidθi + pϕidϕi

.

(1)

Deﬁnition 1. A conﬁguration q ∈ W = (S2)n \ ∆ is called a ﬁxed point if it is a
critical point of the force function V .

i

The terminology is justiﬁed since, once placed at such an initial conﬁguration in
S2 with zero initial velocities, the bodies don’t move, so we have a rest point of the
system. Therefore a conﬁguration of this kind can be also thought as a solution of
(1) with zero momenta.

Since in this paper we are mainly interested in ﬁxed points of the 3-body problem,
we must note that the three bodies always lie on a geodesic S1, as shown in [1]. So
for our further purposes we will assume that all n bodies lie on S1. Without loss of
generality, we can take S1 to be the equator, so a ﬁxed point has the form
i ∈ {1, . . . , n},

(2)
If we rotate a ﬁxed point uniformly about the z-axis with any angular velocity ω (cid:54)= 0,
we obtain an associated relative equilibrium:

, ϕi(t) = ϕi (constant), pθi = pϕi = 0,

θi(t) =

2

, ϕi(t) = ai + ωt, pθi = 0, pϕi = miω,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n},

(3)

where a1, . . . , an are constants.

Let us now provide a general criterion for the existence of ﬁxed points for any
number n > 2 masses. Because of the SO(2)-symmetry that acts on the bodies, we
can assume without loss of generality that

0 = ϕ1 < ϕ2 < ··· < ϕn < 2π.

Since ﬁxed points cannot lie within one hemisphere, [1], we necessarily have that

ϕi+1 − ϕi < π,

i ∈ {1, . . . , n − 1} and ϕn − ϕ1 > π.

Proposition 2. A conﬁguration q on (S1)n \ ∆ is a ﬁxed point if and only if

3 Triangular ﬁxed points
In this section we focus on the case n = 3. We set α = ϕ2 − ϕ1, β = ϕ3 − ϕ2. Then,
since ϕi+1 − ϕi < π, we obtain

0 < α < π,

0 < β < π,

π < α + β < 2π

(5)

and

d12 = α, d12 = β, d13 = 2π − (α + β).

From the point of view of Euclidean geometry, a ﬁxed point for three masses forms a
triangle in the xy-plane. We have ∠q2q1q3 = d23
2 , and, similarly, the two other
angles are acute. Thus each ﬁxed point must be an acute triangle (see Figure 1).

With the help of these equations, we can now ﬁnd all ﬁxed points. It is known on one
hand that, for any acute triangle conﬁguration, there are mass triples (m1, m2, m3)

4

that generate ﬁxed points, [4, 16]. On the other hand, not all mass triples can form
ﬁxed points. So for what mass triples, are there ﬁxed points and how many such ﬁxed
points occur in each case? We count these conﬁgurations by ﬁxing

ϕ1 = 0 < ϕ2 < ϕ3 < 2π,

since any other conﬁgurations diﬀers from this one by an isometry. It is easy to see
that for any acute triangle there are inﬁnitely many admissible mass triples,

(7)

Hence we normalize the masses by taking m1 + m2 + m3 = 1. Then the admissible
masses can be represented by (m1, m2) ∈ (0, 1) × (0, 1). Let us denote by U the open
region in R2 deﬁned by (5), i.e., 0 < α < π, 0 < β < π, π < α + β < 2π. Then (7)

Then we can formulate the question related to the admissible masses in more
precise terms: What is the image of χ? Is χ injective? Or, in other words, for
what pairs (m1, m2) can we ﬁnd an acute triangle ﬁxed-point conﬁguration? Is such
conﬁguration unique? The following result provides the answers to these questions.

Theorem 3. Let

V := {(m1, m2) ∈ (0, 1) × (0, 1) : m2

3 − 2m1m2m3 < 0},

where m3 = 1 − (m1 + m2) (see Figure 3). Then there exists an acute triangle
ﬁxed-point conﬁguration only for mass triples (m1, m2, m3 = 1 − m1 − m2) such that
(m1, m2) ∈ V. Furthermore, such a conﬁguration is unique.
Proof. Our approach is to ﬁnd the inverse mapping (α, β) = χ−1(m1, m2). Then
inequalities (5) would yield inequalities for (m1, m2), which would give V := χ(U),
and since the inverse mapping exists, χ : U → V must be bijective, so the conﬁguration
is unique.

and we obtain

To ﬁnd χ(U), note that the condition (5) is equivalent to

cos2 α < 1, cos2 β < 1,

sin(α + β) < 0.

Substituting (8) into the above inequalities and using the normalization condition
m1 + m2 + m3 = 1, we ﬁnd that the three inequalities lead to the same relationship:

m2

2 + m2

2m2

3 + m2

3 − 2m1m2m3 < 0,

which is the image of the mapping χ and it gives all admissible mass triples, a remark
that completes the proof (see also Figure 2).

We end this section with a property of the acute isosceles triangle ﬁxed-point
conﬁgurations. The result below was ﬁrst obtained in [4], so here we come up with a
simpler proof.

Corollary 4. For each acute isosceles triangle ﬁxed-point conﬁguration, if the masses
m1 and m3 are at the vertices of the base, then m1 = m3 and m1 < 4m2. Reciprocally,
if m1 = m3 and m1 < 4m2, then the only kind of ﬁxed point these three masses can
form is an acute isosceles triangle.

Proof. Let the ﬁxed-point conﬁguration be an acute isosceles triangle, for instance,
α = β, then by (7), we have m1 = m3. Consequently
3 − 2m1m2m3 = m2

(cid:1) < 0.

Therefore

which implies that

1 < 2m2(1 − m2) = 2m2 · 2m1,
m2

m1 < 4m2.

Reciprocally, if m1 = m3 and m1 < 4m2, then the bodies can form an acute isosceles
triangle ﬁxed-point conﬁguration by the ﬁrst part of this corollary. They can only
form such conﬁguration by Theorem 3.

4 Reduction and stability on S1

It is easy to see that if the initial velocity of each particle is conﬁned to the tangent
space T (S1), then the motion takes place in T ∗(S1)3 forever, where T ∗(S1) is the
In other words, T ∗(S1)3 is an invariant manifold of the
cotangent bundle of S1.
equations of motion. In this section, we are going to study the stability of all acute
triangle ﬁxed-point solutions and their associated relative equilibria on this invariant
manifold. We will ﬁrst perform the reduction of the 3-body problem to T ∗(S1)3 and
then prove that all these solutions are Lyapunov stable.

Conﬁned to T ∗(S1)3, the Hamiltonian system take the form

H(ϕi, pϕi) =

(cid:33)

(cid:32)(cid:88)

i

It is easy to see that in these coordinates, the conserved total angular momentum [1]
is given by the expression

J(ϕi, pϕi) = pϕ1 + pϕ2 + pϕ3.

We further restrict the study of the stability of relative equilibria to the quotient

space S(cid:48)

p of T ∗(S1)3, which we deﬁne using

Sp := {(q, p) ∈ T ∗(S1)3 : J = p},

and let S(cid:48)
p be the quotient space under the Lie group SO(2). For all values of p,
these spaces are always smooth manifolds and have dimension 4. We can apply this
procedure to the ﬁxed-point solutions as well. The advantage of this approach is
to eliminate the drift caused by the SO(2) symmetry on the bodies.
Indeed, by
symmetry, if we perturb a ﬁxed-point solution with some initial velocity ˙ϕi = , then
we obtain a relative equilibrium with angular velocity . We can therefore introduce
the deﬁnition below.

Deﬁnition 5. A ﬁxed-point solution (or its associated relative equilibrium) is Lya-
punov stable on S1 if the corresponding rest point of the reduced Hamiltonian system
on the quotient space S(cid:48)

p is Lyapunov stable.

Thus we need to explicitly ﬁnd the quotient manifold S(cid:48)

p and the reduced Hamil-
tonian Hp (see [14] for a theoretical approach to this kind of prolems). The angular
momentum here behaves like the linear momentum of the classical n-body problem.
Thus to perform the reduction, we introduce a type of Jacobi coordinates [15]:

˜ϕ =

1
¯m

where

(m1ϕ1 + m2ϕ2 + m3ϕ3), φ1 = ϕ2 − ϕ1, φ2 = ϕ3 − ν1ϕ1 − ν2ϕ2,

¯m = m1 + m2 + m3,

ν1 =

m1

m1 + m2

,

ν2 =

m2

m2 + m3

.

The corresponding conjugate momenta are then given by

p ˜ϕ = ¯m ˙˜ϕ,

pφ1 = ν3 ˙φ1,

pφ2 = ν4 ˙φ2,

7

where ν3 = m1m2
m1+m2

and ν4 = (m1+m2)m3

¯m

. It is easy to verify that

p ˜ϕd ˜ϕ + pφ1dφ1 + pφ2dφ2 = pϕ1dϕ1 + pϕ2dϕ2 + pϕ3dϕ3

and that the Hamiltonian is

− V (φ1, φ2),

where the new force function V (φ1, φ2) is the same as the old one. We now study the
stability of the ﬁxed-point solution. In this case, p = 0. On the quotient space S(cid:48)
0, we
have ˜ϕ = p ˜ϕ = 0, thus we use φ1, φ2, pφ1, pφ2 as the coordinates of the 4-dimensional
manifold S(cid:48)

0. Under these coordinates, we have the reduced Hamiltonian function

(cid:32) p2

(cid:33)

H0 =

− V (φ1, φ2).

Then the ﬁxed-point solution (ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3, 0, 0, 0) we want to study in T ∗(S1)3 becomes
a rest point of the reduced Hamiltonian system on S(cid:48)
0:

φ1 = α, φ2 = β − ν1α,

pφ1 = 0,

pφ2 = 0.

Let us denote this rest point by X. Our goal is to study the stability of X, a property
given by the following result.
Theorem 6. Every acute triangle ﬁxed-point solution is Lyapunov stable on S1.

Proof. We will show that the rest point X is a local minimum of the Hamiltonian H0.
Since the Hamiltonian is preserved during any motion, we can then conclude that the
rest point X is stable. The rest point X is obviously a minimum of the kinetic energy.
We will show that it is also a local maximum of V by studying its Hessian matrix.
Recall that d12 = α, d23 = β, d13 = 2π− (α + β). By straightforward computation,

we obtain that the Hessian matrix H(V ) of V at X has the form

Hence the trace of H(V ) is negative. Here we use the fact that (α, β) is in region (5),
thus sin α > 0, sin β > 0, and sin(α + β) < 0. Further straightforward computations
that the determinant of 1

2 H(V ) is

m1m2m2
3

sin2(α + β) sin2 β

> 0.

These two facts imply that the two eigenvalues of H(V ) are both negative. Then
the ﬁxed-point conﬁguration (α, β) is a local maximum of V . We can thus conclude
that the rest point X = (φ1, φ2, 0, 0) is a local minimum of H = T − V . This remark
completes the proof.

We further study the stability of the associated relative equilibria. In this case,
¯mω, we have p ˜ϕ = ¯mω, ˜ϕ = 0, thus
¯mω. Under

J = pϕ1 +pϕ2 +pϕ3 = ¯mω. On the quotient space S(cid:48)
we use φ1, φ2, pφ1, pφ2 as the coordinates of the 4-dimensional manifold S(cid:48)
these coordinates, we have the reduced Hamiltonian

H ¯mω =

Then the relative equilibrium (3) in T ∗(S1)3 becomes a rest point in S(cid:48)

¯mω,

φ1 = α, φ2 = β − ν1α, pφ1 = 0, pφ2 = 0.

Let us denote this rest point by X1. Note that H0 and H ¯mω are the same up to a
constant. Then we can conclude that X1 is also a local minimum of H ¯mω. So we have
proved the following result.

Theorem 7. Every relative equilibrium associated to an acute triangle ﬁxed-point
conﬁguration is Lyapunov stable on S1.

Remark 8. The method of proving the stability of relative equilibria by showing that
the rest points are minima of the Hamiltonian never works in the classical n-body
problem. The obstacle lies in the fact that planar central conﬁgurations of the classical
n-body problem are never maxima of the force function, [10].

Instability on S2

5
In this section we study the linear stability of the above solutions on S2. We ﬁrst
introduce rotating coordinates to treat a general relative equilibrium on S2 as rest
point, and obtain the linearized system ˙v = L(v − Xω). We then compute L for
relative equilibria associated with ﬁxed-point conﬁgurations on the equator. As in
the classical n-body problem, we study the stability of the rest points on a proper
subspace. Inspired by the work of Moeckel [10], we ﬁnd the proper linear subspace
E. In the end, we show that these solutions are unstable by ﬁnding the normal form
of L on the subspace E.

So consider a general relative equilibrium on S2 with angular velocity ω and in-

troduce the rotating coordinates
˙θi = ˙θi, ϕi = ϕi − ωt,

θi = θi,

˙ϕi = ˙ϕi − ω, pθi = pθi, pϕi = pϕi, i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}.

We can now ﬁnd the normal form of L by computing the normal forms of HM−1

and GM−1.
Lemma 10. HM−1 and GM−1 are diagonalizable. If u ∈ Cn is an eigenvector of
HM−1 (GM−1) with eigenvalue λ (cid:54)= 0, then there exist a two dimensional invariant

of HM−1 (GM−1) with eigenvalue 0, then there exist a two dimensional invariant

Proof. It is enough to prove this for HM−1. Note H is symmetric, thus HM−1 is
symmetric with respect to the inner product (cid:104)v, w(cid:105) = vT M w so it is diagonalizable
with respect to some M orthogonal basis. Now suppose HM−1u = λu, λ (cid:54)= 0. Then

Normally, a rest point Xω is called linearly stable if Xω is a stable rest point of
the linearized system (10). However, as for relative equilibria of the classical n-body
problem, the symmetries and integrals of the problem make it impossible to satisfy
this condition.

Note that V is invariant under the SO(3) action, which implies that any ﬁxed-
point conﬁguration remains a ﬁxed-point conﬁguration after any rotation. We can
ﬁnd the three vectors corresponding to the three rotations:

Then using Lemma 11, we obtain that E1 is an invariant subspace for L. The matrix
of L|E1 in this basis is

Though all eigenvalues on E1 are 0, there are three nontrivial Jordan blocks, a fact
which implies that the rest point is not linearly stable in the conventional sense. This
instability is trivial as a natural eﬀect of the symmetry of this Hamiltonian system.
Indeed, we can perturb a relative equilibrium with angular velocity ω into another

13

relative equilibrium with ˙ϕi = ω +. Then the angular positions of nearby orbits drift
away from each other, a property mathematically reﬂected by the nontrivial Jordan
blocks, as remarked in [11].

It is traditional in celestial mechanics to view the drifts in this subspace as harm-
less. Indeed, they can be eliminated by ﬁxing the angular momentum and passing to
a quotient manifold under the action of the rotational symmetry group, [12]. Thus
it is reasonable to formulate a deﬁnition of linear stability based on the behaviour of
L in a complementary subspace, [10]. To deﬁne such a subspace, it is necessary to
introduce the skew inner product of two complex vectors v, w ∈ C4n :

Ω(v, w) = vT Jw, J4n×4n =

(cid:20)0 −I

(cid:21)

I

0

.

Using the fact that L = JS, ST = S, where S is the Hessian matrix of the Hamiltonian
at Xω, we obtain that

Ω(v, Lw) = −Ω(Lv, w).

With the help of this property it is easy to show that the skew-orthogonal complement
of an invariant subspace of L is again invariant.
Indeed, let E denote the skew
orthogonal complement in C4n of E1, that is,

E = {v ∈ C4n : Ω(v, w) = 0 for all w ∈ E1}.

Then E is an L invariant subspace of dimension 4n − 6.

Deﬁnition 12. A relative equilibrium Xω associated with a ﬁxed-point conﬁguration
on the equator is called linearly stable if Xω is a stable rest point of the restriction
of the linearized equation (10) to E.

With this deﬁnition, we obtain the following result.

Corollary 13. For relative equilibria associated with ﬁxed-point conﬁgurations on the
equator, their linear stability on S2 is independent of the angular velocity ω. This is
also true for ﬁxed points, i.e. when ω = 0.

Proof. Since the matrix L does not contain ω, we conclude that the linear stability
of the solutions does not dependent on ω.

Finally we are able to state the main result of this section. For n = 3, i.e., the
relative equilibria associated with acute triangle ﬁxed-point conﬁgurations, we have
E = C6, and we can ﬁnd the normal form of L|E.
Theorem 14. For each acute triangle ﬁxed-point conﬁguration, L|E is diagonalizable
and in properly chosen basis,

where 0, 0, λ1 > 0 are the eigenvalues of HM−1, and 0, λ2 < 0, λ3 < 0 are the
eigenvalues of GM−1. All acute triangle ﬁxed-point solutions on the equator and all
associated relative equilibria are unstable on S2.

14

Proof. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the eigenvalues of HM−1 and GM−1. Recall that d12 = α, d23 =
β, d13 = 2π − (α + β). Using α, β, by direct computation, we obtain that

Lemma 11 implies that M v1 and M v2 are two eigenvectors of HM−1 with eigenvalue
0. Thus the other eigenvalue λ1 equals the trace of the matrix. Using the same idea
as in the proof of Theorem 6, we ﬁnd that the three diagonal entries are

Hence λ1 is positive since it equals the trace. Here we use the fact that (α, β) is in
region (5), thus sin α > 0, sin β > 0, and sin(α + β) < 0.
Lemma 11 also implies that G has one eigenvalue 0. Note that the proof of
Theorem 6 implies that ﬁxed-point conﬁgurations are local maxima of V on (S1)3\∆.

Thus the two other eigenvalues of G = ∂2V

the eigenvalues of GM−1 are 0, λ2 < 0, λ3 < 0.
