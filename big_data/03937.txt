ABSTRACT

We report magnetic ﬁeld measurements for κ1 Cet, a proxy of the young Sun when life arose on Earth. We carry out an analysis
of the magnetic properties determined from spectropolarimetric observations and reconstruct its large-scale surface magnetic
ﬁeld to derive the magnetic environment, stellar winds and particle ﬂux permeating the interplanetary medium around κ1 Cet.
˙M = 9.7 × 10−13 M(cid:12) yr−1, i.e., a factor 50 times larger than the
Our results show a closer magnetosphere and mass-loss rate of
current solar wind mass-loss rate, resulting in a larger interaction via space weather disturbances between the stellar wind and
a hypothetical young-Earth analogue, potentially aﬀecting the planet’s habitability. Interaction of the wind from the young Sun
with the planetary ancient magnetic ﬁeld may have aﬀected the young Earth and its life conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION

Spectropolarimetric observations allow us to reconstruct
the magnetic ﬁeld topology of the stellar photosphere and
providing us to quantitatively investigate the interactions be-
tween the stellar wind and the surrounding planetary system.
Large-scale surface magnetic ﬁelds measurements of a young
Sun proxy from Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) techniques
(Semel 1989; Donati et al. 2006) give us crucial information
about the early Sun’s magnetic activity.

A key factor for understanding the origin and evolution of
life on Earth is the evolution of the Sun itself, especially the
early evolution of its radiation ﬁeld, particle and magnetic
properties. The radiation ﬁeld deﬁnes the habitable zone, a
region in which orbiting planets could sustain liquid water at
their surface (Huang 1960; Kopparapu et al. 2013). The parti-
cle and magnetic environment deﬁne the type of interactions
between the star and the planet. In the case of magnetized
planets, such as the Earth that developed a magnetic ﬁeld at
least four billion years ago (Tarduno et al. 2015), their mag-
netic ﬁelds act as obstacles to the stellar wind, deﬂecting it and
protecting the upper planetary atmospheres and ionospheres
against the direct impact of stellar wind plasmas and high-
energy particles (Kulikov et al. 2007; Lammer et al. 2007).

et al. (2005), studied a small sample in the X-ray, EUV, and
FUV domains. However, nothing or little has been done in
this program with respect to the magnetic ﬁeld properties for
those stars. Young solar analogue stars rotate faster than the
Sun and show a much higher level of magnetic activity with
highly energetic ﬂares. This behavior is driven by the dy-
namo mechanism, which operates in rather diﬀerent regimes
in these young objects. A characterization of a genuine young
Sun’s proxy is a diﬃcult task, because ages for ﬁeld stars,
particularly for those on the bottom of the main sequence are
notoriously diﬃcult to be derived (e.g., do Nascimento et al.
2014). Fortunately, stellar rotation rates for young low mass
star decrease with time as they lose angular momenta. This
rotation rates give a relation to determine stellar age (Kawaler
1989; Barnes 2007; Meibom et al. 2015).

Among the solar proxies studied by the Sun in Time, κ1
Cet (HD 20630, HIP 15457) a nearby G5 dwarf star with V
= 4.85 and age from 0.4 Gyr to 0.6 Gyr (Ribas et al. 2010)
stands out potentially having a mass very close to solar and
age of the Sun when the window favorable to the origin of
life opened on Earth around 3.8 Gyr ago or earlier (Mojz-
sis et al. 1996). This corresponds to the period when favor-
able physicochemical and geological conditions became es-
tablished and after the late heavy bombardment. As to the
Sun at this stage, κ1 Cet radiation environment determined
the properties and chemical composition of the close plane-
tary atmospheres, and provide an important constraint of the
role played by the Earth’s magnetospheric protection at the
critical time at the start of the Archean epoch (Mojzsis et al.
1996), when life is thought to have originated on Earth. This
is also the epoch when Mars lost its liquid water inventory at
the end of the Noachian epoch some 3.7 Gyr ago (Jakosky
et al. 2001). Study based on κ1 Cet can also clarify the bio-
logical implications of the high-energy particles at this period
(Cnossen et al. 2008). Such a study requires careful analysis
based on reasonably bright stars at this speciﬁc evolutionary
state, and there are only a few number of bright solar ana-
logues at this age of κ1 Cet . Stars like Pi1 UMa and EK Dra
are bright enough but much younger.  Eri is closer to the κ1
Cet age, but deﬁnitely less massive than the Sun.

In this letter, we investigate the magnetic and particle envi-

2

ronments surrounding κ1 Cet . We also carry out a compre-
hensive analysis of κ1 Cet magnetic properties, evolutionary
state, rotation and age. Our goal is to contribute to the under-
standing of the early Sun’s magnetism at a critical time when
life arose on Earth and investigate how the wind of a young
Sun might have aﬀected the young Earth.

2. OBSERVATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS

Spectropolarimetric data of κ1 Cet were collected with the
NARVAL spectropolarimeter (Auri`ere 2003) at the 2.0-m
Bernard Lyot Telescope (TBL) of Pic du Midi Observatory.
NARVAL comprises a Cassegrain-mounted achromatic po-
larimeter and a bench-mounted cross-dispersed echelle spec-
trograph. In polarimetric mode, NARVAL has a spectral res-
olution of about 65,000 and covers the whole optical domain
in one single exposure, with nearly continuous spectral cov-
erage ranging from 370 nm to 1000 nm over 40 grating or-
ders. The data reduction is performed through Libre-ESpRIT
package based on ESPRIT (Donati et al. 1997). In the case
of κ1 Cet, Stokes I and V (circularly-polarized) spectra were
gathered. This set of κ1 Cet observations were part of TBL’s
Bcool Large Program (Marsden et al. 2014). The resulting
time-series is composed of 14 individual observations col-
lected over 53 consecutive nights, between 2012 Oct. 1st and
2012 Nov. 22th. The ﬁrst seven spectra of the time-series
were secured over 13 consecutive nights, while weather is-
sues forced a sparser temporal coverage for the second half of
the data set. The largest temporal gap between Oct. 31 and
Nov. 12, during which more than one rotation period was left
uncovered (assuming a rotation period of 9.2 d). Considered
altogether and spite of time gaps, this ensemble of data pro-
vides a dense phase coverage of κ1 Cet, with no phase gap
larger than about 0.15. Usually for cool active stars, Stokes
V spectra do not display any detectable signatures in the indi-
vidual spectral lines, even with a peak S /N in excess of 1,000
(at wavelengths close to 730 nm). In this situation, we take
advantage of the fact that, at ﬁrst order, Stokes V Zeeman sig-
natures of diﬀerent spectral lines harbor a similar shape and
diﬀer only by their amplitude, so that a multiline approach in
the form of a cross-correlation technique is able to greatly
improve the detectability of tiny polarized signatures. We
employ here the Least-Squares-Deconvolution method (LSD,
Donati et al. 1997; Kochukhov 2010) using a procedure simi-
lar to the one described in Marsden et al. (2014). Our line-list
is extracted from the VALD data base (Kupka et al. 2000)
and is computed for a set of atmospheric parameters (eﬀec-
tive temperature and surface gravity) similar to those of κ1
Cet . From a total of about 8,400 spectral lines recorded in
NARVAL spectra and listed in our line mask, the ﬁnal S /N
of Stokes V LSD pseudo-proﬁles is ranging from 16,000 to
28,000, well enough to detect Zeeman signatures at all avail-
able observations (Figure 1).

3. FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETERS AND EVOLUTIONARY STATUS
Based on our NARVAL data we performed spectroscopic
analysis of κ1 Cet to redetermine stellar parameters as in
do Nascimento et al. (2013) and references therein. We used
excitation and ionization equilibrium of a set of 209 Fe I and
several Fe II lines and an atmosphere model and mostly lab-
oratory g f -values to compute a synthetic spectra. The best
solution from this synthetic analysis was ﬁtted to the NAR-
VAL spectrum for the set of parameters Teﬀ = 5705 ± 50 K,
[Fe/H] = +0.10 ± 0.05 dex, log g = 4.49 ± 0.10

strength.

Several photometric and spectroscopic observational cam-
paigns were carried out to determine κ1 Cet fundamental pa-
rameters. Ribas et al. (2010) determined the photometric
Teﬀ of κ1 Cet from intermediate-band Str¨omgren photometry,
based on the 2MASS near-IR photometry and a ﬁt of the spec-
tral energy distribution with stellar atmosphere models. This
photometric method yielded Teﬀ = 5685 ± 45 K. Ribas et al.
(2010) also determined spectroscopic fundamental parame-
ters of κ1 Cet as Teﬀ = 5780 ± 30 K, log g = 4.48 ± 0.10 dex,
[Fe/H] = +0.07 ± 0.04 dex. Valenti & Fischer (2005) gives
Teﬀ = 5742 K, log g = 4.49 dex, [M/H] = +0.10 dex. Paletou
et al. (2015), from high resolution NARVAL Echelle spectra
(R = 65,000, S/N ∼ 1000) described in the Sect. 2, determined
Teﬀ = 5745 ± 101 K, log g = 4.45 ± 0.09 dex, [Fe/H] = +0.08
± 0.11. Spectroscopic Teﬀ values are hotter than photomet-
ric, and a possible explanation of this oﬀset could be eﬀects
of high chromospheric activity and, an enhanced non-local
UV radiation ﬁeld resulting in a photospheric overionization
(Ribas et al. 2010). The presented spectroscopic Teﬀ values
are in agreement within the uncertainty. Finally we used our
determined solution Teﬀ = 5705 ± 50 K, [Fe/H] = +0.10 ±
0.05 dex, log g = 4.49 ± 0.10. This yields a logN(Li) = 2.05,
in good agreement with Ribas et al. (2010).
To constrain the evolutionary status of κ1 Cet, we used
the spectroscopic solution within computed models with the
Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code (do Nascimento et al.
2013). We used models with an initial composition from
Grevesse & Noels (1993). Transport of chemicals and angu-
lar momentum due to rotation-induced mixing are computed
as described in Vauclair & Th´eado (2003). The angular mo-
mentum evolution follows the Kawaler (1988) prescription.
We calibrated a solar model as Richard et al. (1996) and used
this calibration to compute κ1 Cet model. These models, to-
gether with lithium abundance measurement, result in mass of
1.02 ± 0.02 M(cid:12), an age between 0.5 Gyr to 0.9 Gyr for κ1 Cet,
consistent with G¨udel et al. (1997) estimated age of 0.75 Gyr

and Marsden et al. (2014) estimated age of 0.82 Gyr using our
data and activity-age calibration.

For rotation period Prot, as in do Nascimento et al. (2014),
we measured the average surface Prot from light curves. Here
we used the MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of
Stars) (Walker et al. 2003) light curve modulation. MOST
continuously observed κ1 Cet for weeks at a time providing
a Prot (Walker et al. 2003). We extract Prot from Lomb–
Scargle periodogram (Scargle 1982) and a wavelet analysis
of the light curve. The Prot obtained was Prot = 8.77d ± 0.8
days, three times lower than the solar Prot. The Prot we have
measured from the MOST light curves allows us an indepen-
dent (from classical isochrone) age derivation of κ1 Cet using
gyrochronology (Skumanich 1972; Barnes 2007). The gy-
rochronology age of κ1 Cet that we derive range from 0.4 Gyr
to 0.6 Gyr, consistent with the predictions from Ribas et al.
(2010) and ages determined from evolutionary tracks.

4. THE LARGE-SCALE MAGNETIC FIELD TOPOLOGY

From the time-series of Stokes V proﬁles, we used the
ZDI method (Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, Semel 1989) to re-
construct the large-scale magnetic topology of the star. Our
implementation of the ZDI algorithm is the one detailed by
Donati et al. (2006), where the surface magnetic ﬁeld is pro-
jected onto a spherical harmonics frame. We assume during
reconstruction a projected rotational velocity equal to 5 km/s
(Valenti & Fischer 2005), a radial velocity equal to 19.1 km/s,
and an inclination angle of 60 degrees (from the projected ro-
tational velocity, radius and stellar rotation period). We trun-
cate the spherical harmonics expansion to modes with l ≤ 10
since no improvement is noticed in our model if we allow for
a more complex ﬁeld topology. Given the large time-span of
our observations, some level of variability is expected in the
surface magnetic topology. A fair amount of this intrinsic evo-
lution is due to diﬀerential rotation, which can be taken into
account in our inversion procedure assuming that the surface
shear obeys a simple law of the form Ω(l) = Ωeq − sin2(l)dΩ,

where Ω(l) is the rotation rate at latitude l, Ωeq is the rota-
tion rate of the equator and dΩ is the diﬀerence of rotation
rate between the pole and the equator. We optimize the two
free parameters Ωeq and dΩ by computing a 2D grid of ZDI
models spanning a range of values of these two parameters,
following the approach of Petit et al. 2002. By doing so, we
obtain a minimal reduced χ2 equal to 1.3 at Ωeq = 0.7 rad/d
and dΩ = 0.056 rad/d. These values correspond to a surface
shear roughly solar in magnitude, with an equatorial rotation
period Peq
= 8.96 d, while the polar region rotates in about

Figure 2 from top to bottom presents the inclination of ﬁeld
lines over the stellar surface and the resulting large-scale mag-
netic geometry. The surface-averaged ﬁeld strength is equal to
24 G, with a maximum value of 61 G at phase 0.1. A majority
(61%) of the magnetic energy is stored in the toroidal ﬁeld
component, showing up as several regions with ﬁeld lines
nearly horizontal and parallel to the equator, e.g. at phase 0.1.
The dipolar component of the ﬁeld contains about 47% of the
magnetic energy of the poloidal ﬁeld component, but signif-
icant energy is also seen at (cid:96) > 3, where 20% of the mag-
netic energy is reconstructed. Axisymmetric modes display
66% of the total magnetic energy. These magnetic properties
are rather typical of other young Sun-like stars previously ob-
served and modeled with similar techniques (Petit et al. 2008,
Folsom et al. 2016 and references therein).

5. STELLAR WIND OF κ1 Cet AND EFFECTS ON THE

MAGNETOSPHERE OF THE YOUNG EARTH

The spectropolarimetric observations of κ1 Cet allow us to
reconstruct its large-scale surface magnetic ﬁeld. However, to
derive the magnetic environment and particle ﬂux permeating
the interplanetary medium around κ1 Cet, one needs to rely on
models of stellar winds. The stellar wind model we use here
is identical to the one presented in Vidotto et al. (2012, 2015),
in which we use the three-dimensional magnetohydrodynam-
ics (MHD) numerical code BATS-R-US (Powell et al. 1999;
T´oth et al. 2012) to solve the set of ideal MHD equations. In
this model, we use, as inner boundary conditions for the stel-
lar magnetic ﬁeld, the radial component of the reconstructed
surface magnetic ﬁeld of κ1 Cet (Section 4). We assume the
wind is polytropic, with a polytropic index of γ = 1.1, and

Figure 4. The ram pressure of the stellar wind of κ1 Cet. The circle indi-
cates the position of the orbit of a young-Earth analogue. Red portions of the
orbit indicates regions of negative vertical component of the interplanetary
magnetic ﬁeld (Bz < 0).
consists of a fully ionised hydrogen plasma. We further as-
sume a stellar wind base density of 109 cm−3 and a base tem-
perature of 2 MK. Figure 3 shows the large-scale magnetic
ﬁeld embedded in the wind of κ1 Cet. In our model, we derive
˙M = 9.7 × 10−13 M(cid:12) yr−1, i.e., almost
a mass-loss rate of
50 times larger than the current solar wind mass-loss rate.
It is interesting to compare our results to the empirical cor-
relation between ˙M and X-ray ﬂuxes (FX) derived by Wood
et al. (2014). For κ1 Cet, the X-ray luminosity is 1028.79 erg/s
(Wood et al. 2012). Assuming a stellar radius of 0.95R(cid:12), we
derive FX (cid:39) 106 erg cm−2 s−1 and, according to Wood et al.’s
˙M to be ∼ 63 to 140 times the current solar wind
relation,
˙M derivation roughly agrees with
mass-loss rate. Thus, our
the lower envelope of the empirical correlation of Wood et al.
(2014) and derived mass-loss rate of Airapetian & Usmanov
(2016).

The enhanced mass-loss rate of the young solar analogue
κ1 Cet implies that the strengths of the interactions between
the stellar wind and a hypothetical young-Earth analogue is
larger than the current interactions between the present-day
solar wind and Earth. To quantify this, we calculate the ram
pressure of the wind of κ1 Cet as Pram = ρu2, where ρ is
the particle density and u the wind velocity (Figure 4). Pres-
sure balance between the magnetic pressure of a hypothetical
young-Earth and the ram pressure of the young Sun’s wind
allows us to estimate the magnetospheric size of the young-
Earth:

where Beq,⊕ is the equatorial ﬁeld strength of the young
Earth dipolar magnetic ﬁeld and f (cid:39) 22/6 is a correc-
tion factor used to account for the eﬀects of currents (e.g.
Cravens 2004). Figure 5a shows the stand-oﬀ distance of
the Earth’s magnetopause calculated using Eq. (1). Here,
we assume three values for Beq,⊕: (i) Beq,⊕ = 0.31G, identi-
cal to the present-day magnetic ﬁeld strength (e.g., Bagenal
1992); (ii) Beq,⊕ = 0.15G, according to measurements of the
Paleoarchean Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld (3.4Gyr ago) (Tarduno
et al. 2010); and (iii) Beq,⊕ = 0.40G, according to rotation-
dependent dynamo model theory (see Sterenborg et al. 2011).
Depending on the assumed ﬁeld strength of the hypothetical

Magnetic field and wind of Kappa Ceti

young-Earth, the average magnetospheric sizes are (i) 4.8R⊕,
(ii) 3.8R⊕ and (iii) 5.3R⊕, respectively, indicating a size that is
about 34 to 48% the magnetospheric size of the present-day
Earth (about 11R⊕, Bagenal 1992).

The relative orientation of the interplanetary magnetic ﬁeld
with respect to the orientation of the planetary magnetic mo-
ment plays an important role in shaping the open-ﬁeld-line
region (polar cap) of the planet (e.g., Sterenborg et al. 2011).
Through the polar cap, particles can be transported to/from
the interplanetary space. Tarduno et al. (2010) discusses that
the increase in polar cap area should be accompanied by an in-
crease of the volatile losses from the exosphere, which might
aﬀect the composition of the planetary atmosphere over long
timescales. In the case where the vertical component of in-
terplanetary magnetic ﬁeld Bz is parallel to the planet’s mag-
netic moment (or anti-parallel to the planetary magnetic ﬁeld
at rM), the planetary magnetosphere is in its widest open con-

magnetic moment are anti-parallel, there is no signiﬁcant po-
lar cap.

The complex magnetic-ﬁeld topology of κ1 Cet gives rise
to non-uniform directions and strengths of Bz along the plan-
etary orbit. The red (white) semi-circle shown in Figure 4
illustrates portions of the orbital path surrounded by negative
(positive) Bz. Therefore, depending on the relative orientation
between Bz and the planet’s magnetic moment, the colatitude
of the polar cap will range from 0o (closed magnetosphere)
to arcsin(R⊕/rM)1/2 (widest open conﬁguration) (e.g., Vidotto
et al. 2013). Figure 5b shows the colatitude of the polar cap
for the case where the planetary magnetic moment points to-
wards positive z. Portions of the orbit where the planet is
likely to present a closed magnetosphere (from 76 to 140 de-
grees in longitude) are blanked out.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We report a magnetic ﬁeld detection for κ1 Cet with an av-
erage ﬁeld strength of 24 G, and maximum value of 61 G.
The complex magnetic-ﬁeld topology of κ1 Cet gives rise to
non-uniform directions and strengths along a possible plane-
tary orbit. Our stellar wind model for κ1 Cet shows a mass-
loss rate factor 50 times larger than the current solar wind
mass-loss rate, resulting in a larger interaction between the
stellar wind and a hypothetical young-Earth like planet. With
1.02 M(cid:12), an age between 0.4 Gyr to 0.6 Gyr, κ1 Cet is a per-
fect target to study habitability on Earth during the early Sun
phase when life arose on Earth. An enhanced mass-loss, high-
energy emissions from κ1 Cet, supporting the extrapolation
from Newkirk (1980) and Lammer et al. (2007) of a Sun with
stronger activity 3.8 Gyr ago or earlier. Early magnetic ﬁeld
have aﬀected the young Earth and its life conditions and due
to the ancient magnetic ﬁeld on Earth four billion years ago
as measured by Tarduno et al. (2015), the early magnetic in-
teraction between the stellar wind and the young-Earth plane-
tary magnetic ﬁeld may well have prevented the volatile losses
from the Earth exosphere and create conditions to support life.
