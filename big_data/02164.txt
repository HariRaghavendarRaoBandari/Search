Dark energy equation of state w(z) parametrizations with two parameters and given monotonicity
are generically either convex or concave functions. This makes them suitable for ﬁtting either
freezing or thawing quintessence models but not both simultaneously. Fitting a dataset based on a
freezing model with an unsuitable (concave when increasing) w(z) parametrization (like CPL) can
lead to signiﬁcant misleading features like crossing of the phantom divide line, incorrect w(z = 0),
incorrect slope etc. that are not present in the underlying cosmological model. To demonstrate this
fact we generate scattered cosmological data both at the level of w(z) and the luminosity distance
DL(z) based on either thawing or freezing quintessence models and ﬁt them using parametrizations
of convex and of concave type. We then compare statistically signiﬁcant features of the best ﬁt
w(z) with actual features of the underlying model. We thus verify that the use of unsuitable
parametrizations can lead to misleading conclusions. In order to avoid these problems it is important
to either use both convex and concave parametrizations and select the one with the best Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) or use principal component analysis thus splitting the redshift range into
independent bins. In the latter case however, signiﬁcant information about the slope of w(z) at high
1+z )n
redshifts is lost. Finally, we propose a new family of parametrizations (nCPL) w(z) = w0 +wa( z
which generalizes the CPL and interpolates between thawing and freezing parametrizations as the
parameter n increases to values larger than 1.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The simplest cosmological model that is consistent
with current cosmological observations is the ΛCDM
model [1–3]. According to this model, the observed ac-
celerating expansion of the universe is attributed to the
repulsive gravitational force of a cosmological constant
which may be described as a perfect ﬂuid (dark energy
[4–7]) with constant energy density ρ and negative pres-
sure p with equation of state parameter

w =

= −1.

(1.1)

The cosmological observations that are consistent with
ΛCDM include type Ia supernovae [8, 9], baryon acous-
tic oscillations (BAO) [10], anisotropies in the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) [11–13] and large scale
structure [14–21]. These observations allow for signiﬁ-
cant deviations from ΛCDM (e.g. [22]) which are usually
parametrized through two parameter parametrizations of
the form w(z, w0, wa) where w0, wa are parameters that
estimate the deviation of the dark energy equation of
state parameter from the ΛCDM value w = −1. The
quality of ﬁt of such parametrizations may be compared
with the corresponding quality of ﬁt of ΛCDM using in-
formation criteria ([23, 24]) like the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) [25] and the Bayesian Information Crite-
rion (BIC) [26]. These are measures of the relative qual-
ity of statistical models (parametrizations) for a given set

∗ ph06767@cc.uoi.gr
† savvas.nesseris@csic.es
‡ leandros@uoi.gr

of data which penalize models for the number of their pa-
rameters.

For example the AIC which arises from a minimization
of the Kulbak-Leibler information entropy (see [27]) is
deﬁned as

AIC = 2k − 2 ln L,

(1.2)

where k is the number of of estimated parameters in
the model and L is the maximum value of the likeli-
hood function [28]. The preferred model is the one with
the minimum AIC value. Thus AIC rewards goodness
of ﬁt (through the likelihood function), including also a
penalty that is a linearly increasing function of the pa-
rameter number.

In the context of the above comparison, the following

questions arise

1. Are there generally acceptable cosmological data
that are inconsistent with ΛCDM in a statistically
signiﬁcant manner?

2. Is there a dark energy parametrization with better
AIC than ΛCDM in a consistent and statistically
signiﬁcant manner?

3. If there is, what is the class of models it corresponds

to?

At present the answer to the ﬁrst question is negative
despite the dramatic increase of accuracy of cosmological
data [12, 29–32]. In view of this fact and the simplicity of
ΛCDM there has not been signiﬁcant investigation in the
direction of the second question even though the answer
to this question is independent of the answer to the ﬁrst
question.

The standard parametrization used to compare with
the ﬁt of ΛCDM is the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)
[33, 34] which is based on a linear expansion with respect
to the scale factor around its present value a = 1 and is
of the form

w(z) = w0 + wa(1 − a) = w0 + wa

z

1 + z

,

(1.3)

where z is the redshift corresponding to the scale factor
a.

In the context of the CPL parametrization and a few
others considered in the literature there appears to be
no signiﬁcant advantage over ΛCDM [35] in the con-
text of AIC and other similar criteria [24]. However,
there is currently no systematic strategy developed to-
wards constructing parametrizations specially designed
so that they remain simple and natural while at the
same time produce a better AIC than ΛCDM. Such
parametrizations should also be designed to represent ef-
ﬁciently classes of physical models.

The simplest physical class of models which is an alter-
native to ΛCDM is quintessence [36–43] where the role
of the dark energy ﬂuid is played by a minimally cou-
pled to gravity scalar ﬁeld with dynamics determined by
a specially designed scalar ﬁeld potential. This class of
models reduces to ΛCDM for a constant potential. It also
shares the ﬁne tuning problems of ΛCDM since the en-
ergy density of the scalar ﬁeld at present is required to be
unnaturally low (ρDE (cid:39) 10−47GeV 4) which corresponds
to a scalar ﬁeld mass mφ ∼ H0 (cid:39) 10−33eV . However its
dynamical degrees of freedom have the potential to make
the recent domination of dark energy density over matter
more natural.

Quintessence models may be classiﬁed in two broad
categories [39, 44–47]: Thawing models [48–50] and freez-
ing (or tracking) models [51–54].
In the ﬁrst class the
scalar ﬁeld is frozen at early times due to the Hubble
cosmic friction term while at late times when the Hub-
ble parameter decreases, friction becomes subdominant.
The dynamics due to the scalar ﬁeld potential takes over
while a non-zero kinetic term develops, thus increasing
the equation of state parameter of the scalar ﬁeld dark
energy in accordance to the equation

w ≡ pφ
ρφ

=

˙φ2/2 − V (φ)
˙φ2/2 + V (φ)

,

(1.4)

where V (φ) is the scalar ﬁeld potential and pφ, ρφ are the
pressure and energy density of the scalar ﬁeld. Thus in
thawing models, at early times w (cid:39) −1, since the kinetic
energy term is negligible and w > −1 at late times when
the kinetic term starts to develop.
In thawing models
the function w(z) is generically a monotonic convex de-
creasing function which reaches asymptotically at high
redshifts z the value −1.

In the second class of quintessence models (freezing-
tracker models), the potential is steep enough at early
times so that a kinetic term develops but the scalar ﬁeld
gradually slows down as the potential becomes shallower

ted curves) with corresponding best CPL curves (continuous
curves). Notice that CPL can ﬁt thawing models much more
eﬃciently than freezing models.

at late times. For example, for inverse power law poten-
tials of the form V (φ) = M 4+pφ−p(p > 0) the equation
of state of the scalar ﬁeld is constant during the mat-
ter era (w ∼ 0) and decreases towards w = −1 at late
times. Thus, in freezing models the function w(z) is a
generically monotonic convex increasing function which
asymptotes towards w = −1 at late times (low z). Due
to the asymptotic approach of the value w = −1 at late
times, we have w(z) ∼ zn (n > 1) at low z for freezing
models and therefore there is no linear term in the w(z)
expansion.

We therefore have two distinct types of behavior for
w(z) which are motivated by classes of physical models:
decreasing convex function with w(z = 0) > −1 (thawing
behavior) and increasing concave function with w(z =
0) (cid:39) −1 (freezing behavior).

It is easy to see that there is no two parameter
parametrization that can capture the features of both
types of behavior. For example the CPL parametriza-
tion is convex when decreasing and therefore in can cap-
ture the features of thawing models. However, when in-
creasing it is concave and therefore it has diﬃculty to ﬁt
freezing models. This is demonstrated in Fig. 1 where
we show typical forms of w(z) corresponding to thawing
and freezing models along with the corresponding best
ﬁt CPL parametrizations. Diﬀerent types of diﬃculties
of the CPL parametrization have also been pointed out
recently in [55].

Several parametrizations have been proposed in the lit-
erature [46, 56–75]. As examples we refer to the Barboza-
Alcaniz (BA) [75] deﬁned as

w(z) = w0 + wa

develops freezing properties (convex when increasing). In
Section III we review current observational constraints
on thawing and freezing models pointing out that thaw-
ing models are signiﬁcantly more constrained observa-
tionally due to their predicted divergence of w(z) from
the ΛCDM value w = −1 at late times when there are
several datasets constraining w to be close to the ΛCDM
value −1. We also generate mock w(z) scattered data
with errorbars consistent with current observational con-
straints but with mean values obtained from the speciﬁc
thawing and freezing quintessence models of Section II.
We ﬁt the data obtained from observationally allowed
freezing models with freezing parametrizations and with
thawing parametrizations (e.g. CPL) showing that sev-
eral incorrect statistically signiﬁcant conclusions can be
obtained if the inappropriate (thawing) parametrization
is used. This analysis is repeated with data obtained from
observationally allowed thawing models even though this
class of models has small allowed deviations from ΛCDM.
In Section IV we generate scattered luminosity distance
dL(z) data consistent with Union 2.1 errorbars but with
mean values obtained from the speciﬁc thawing and freez-
ing quintessence models of Section II. We ﬁt the data ob-
tained from observationally allowed freezing models with
freezing parametrizations and with thawing parametriza-
tions (e.g. CPL) at the luminosity distance level testing
the conclusions of Section III with data at the luminosity
distance level.

Finally in Section V we conclude and summarize stress-
ing the existence of two classes of parametrizations and
the importance of identifying and using the correct class
for a given dataset. We also discuss possible extensions
of the present analysis.

w(z) = w0 + waz.

(1.7)

Interestingly, none of these parametrizations is appro-
priate for ﬁtting freezing models since they are all con-
cave when increasing as shown in Fig. 2.

In view of the existence of two classes of behaviors for
w(z) (thawing and freezing) and the fact that the cur-
rently used parametrizations appear to be suitable only
for the thawing class, the following questions arise

1. What two parameter parametrization is optimal for
ﬁtting each class of models and in particular the
freezing class?

2. What kind of misleading conclusions may arise
when using an inappropriate parametrization
to ﬁt deviations
from ΛCDM? Inappropriate
parametrization in this context is one that does
not have the concavity features corresponding to
the underlying cosmological model.

The goal of the present analysis is to address these
questions. The structure of this paper is the following:
In Section II we review thawing and freezing quintessence
models and derive w(z) in the context of a general but
simple quintessence potential for freezing and thawing
initial conditions. We also introduce a simple measure
that quantiﬁes the suitability of a parametrization for ﬁt-
ting a given quintessence model. We implement this mea-
sure and derive the suitability of a few parametrizations
for ﬁtting freezing and thawing forms of w(z). Among
the tested parametrizations is a generalized form of CPL
(called nCPL) which is equipped with one more parame-
ter (n) allowing it to interpolate between a two parameter
freezing and a thawing parametrization.

For n = 1 it reduces to the usual form of CPL (suit-
able for thawing models) while for larger values of n it

(2.11)

and the eﬀective equation of state of the scalar ﬁeld as

γφ ≡ 1 + wφ =

2x2

x2 + y2 .

(2.12)

We now assume a quintessence potential of the form

[76]

V (φ) = Vi e−cφ [1 + αφ] ,

(2.13)

where c and α are parameters. Without loss of generality
we assume an initial condition φi = 0. Given this initial
condition, it is easy to see that acceptable quintessence
behavior with positive deﬁnite potential energy during
evolution is obtained if c > α. This is shown in Fig. 3
where we show a plot of the potential for c > α and
c < α. Notice that for c < α the ﬁeld evolution starting
from φi = 0 is unbounded from below and leads to a
Big Crunch without going through an accelerating phase.
Thus, in what follows we assume c ≥ α. For c = α
the ﬁeld remains constant in unstable equilibrium and
the cosmological evolution is almost identical to ΛCDM
(hilltop quintessence [77, 78]).

FIG. 3. The assumed scalar ﬁeld potential (2.13) for param-
eter values c > α (continuous line) and c < α (dashed line).

We also assume the initial condition ˙φi = 0 since this
leads to thawing quintessence. Assuming a proper nega-
tive time derivative for the scalar ﬁeld leads to a freezing
quintessence behavior. With the thawing initial condi-
˙φi = 0, the initial condition for the dynam-
tions φi = 0,
ical variable λ becomes

λi = −V (cid:48)/V = c − a

(2.14)

and the corresponding dynamical equation for the poten-
tial (2.10) takes the form
√

dλ
dN

=

6 (λ − c)2 x

(2.15)

We now solve the dynamical system with thawing ini-
tial conditions deﬁning the present time (corresponding
to N = N0) as the time when Ωφ = 0.75 for the ﬁrst time.
Note that it is not possible to get to the present value
of Ωφ for all initial conditions. This is demonstrated in
Fig. 4 where we show the solution of the dynamical sys-
tem for various initial conditions.

The equation of state parameter w(N ) can be deter-

mined from the solution x(N ), y(N ) as
x2(N ) − y2(N )
x2(N ) + y2(N )

w(N ) =

(2.16)

while the corresponding scale factor (rescaled so that
a(N0) = 1) is of the form

a =

= eN−N0.

(2.17)

The numerically obtained form of the equation of state
parameter w(N ) may now be converted to a function
of redshift w(z) using equations (2.16), (2.17) and ﬁt
using speciﬁc parametrizations for w(z) like the CPL
parametrization.
In the context of such a ﬁt, the pa-
rameters w0 and wa of equation (1.3) are determined by

the quintessence model than the parameter values ob-
tained using the expansion up to linear order. As ex-
pected all three forms of w(z) agree in the limit of very

values of parameters of the quintessence potential. No-
tice that for zmax < 0.2 the deviation is less than a few
percent. However, for larger zmax the deviation can be
as large as 100%. It is therefore important to avoid us-
ing the linear approximation when estimating the CPL
parameter values that describe a quintessence model.

proach are shown in Fig. 7 for a wide range of param-

measure of the quality of ﬁt may be deﬁned in analogy
to the likelihood for random data as discussed below.

Previous studies [76, 79] have used an expansion of
the numerically obtained w(a) (obtained from equations
(2.16) and (2.17)) around a = 1 to ﬁnd the predicted
parameter values w0 and wa. This approach does not in-
volve a ﬁt over a ﬁnite range of redshifts (z or of scale fac-
tor a) and therefore the derived form of the parametrized
wcpl(z) agrees with the numerically obtained w(z) only
in the limit of low z) (or a = 1).

The approach of these studied involving expanding
around the present time, using equation (2.17) and the
CPL parametrization

w(N ) = w0 + wa(1 − eN−N0 ).

The nCPL parametrization interpolates between being
concave to being convex when increasing as the value of
n from n = 1 (CPL) to larger n. Therefore as discussed
in the Introduction I for larger n it is more suitable for
ﬁtting freezing models while for n = 1 it reduces to the
usual CPL parametrization which is more suitable for
ﬁtting thawing models. This is demonstrated in Fig. 8
where we show the numerically obtained w(z) for thawing
initial conditions (blue dots) along with best ﬁt forms
wbf(z) of the above parametrizations (except CPL which
is shown in Fig. 5) and the corresponding forms obtained
with the linear expansion wlin(z) as described above.

Clearly, parametrizations i-iv can provide a good ﬁt to
the thawing behavior of the numerically obtained w(z).
On the other hand the parametrization v (for n = 7) is
unable to provide a good ﬁt to the thawing quintessence

model. As it will be discussed below it is more suitable to
represent freezing quintessence and other similar models
with convex (when increasing) models.

Using the measure q deﬁned in equation (2.23) we may
quantify the quality of ﬁt of the above parametrizations
for thawing quintessence models. We thus evaluate the
mean value of q for each one of the above parametriza-
tions over several parameters c, α of the quintessence
potential using zmax = 2. We consider the parameter
range that corresponds to the region between the 1σ and
the 2σ contours of Fig. 7 so that they are consistent with
observational constraints but at the same they are not
very close to ΛCDM where all parametrizations perform
equally well since they include ΛCDM as a special case.

The mean values of q for each parametrization along
with the 1σ deviation are shown in Fig. 9. Clearly
parametrizations i-iii are well suited for representing
thawing models since they are convex when decreasing
in agreement with the thawing behavior. The Linear
parametrization iv is neither convex nor concave and
therefore it provides a worse quality of ﬁt for thawing
models (increased q). Finally, the parametrization v
(nCPL with n = 7) is concave when decreasing and is

unable to capture the thawing behavior. It has the high-
est value of q as shown in Fig. 9.

In order to test the ability of the parametrizations con-
sidered to ﬁt freezing quintessence behavior we may keep
the same potential of equation (2.13) but change the ini-
tial conditions for the ﬁeld time derivative from ˙φi = 0
to ˙φi < 0. Thus the ﬁeld is initially moving up its poten-
tial while decelerating and reducing its kinetic term. The
corresponding behavior for w(z) is to be larger than −1
at early times due to the presence of the kinetic term but
tend to −1 at late times as the kinetic term is reduced.
Even though this type of behavior is not tracking at early
times it does produce a freezing behavior for w(z) which
is analogous to the tracking-freezing form.

In Fig. 10 we show the numerically obtained w(z) with
freezing initial conditions along with the best ﬁt for each
parametrization and the corresponding linear expansion
around z = 0 obtained with each parametrization. No-
tice that the linear expansion around the present time
is practically indistinguishable from ΛCDM and is not
representative of the underlying freezing model.

Clearly, the thawing parametrizations i-iv are un-
able to properly represent the freezing behavior of the

TABLE I. A comparison of a variety of two parameter w(z) parametrizations with respect to their ability to eﬃciently ﬁt
thawing and freezing quintessence models. This eﬃciency is measures by the q−value deﬁned by equation (2.23). qth. (qfr.) is
the q−value for ﬁtting a thawing (freezing) quintessence model.

i-iii are unable to represent these freezing quintessence
models. The linear parametrization iv is unable to rep-
resent any of the two classes of models.

As it can be seen from Fig. 10, the attempt to ﬁt the
underlying freezing model with an inappropriate (thaw-
ing) parametrization like the CPL leads to misleading
conclusions. First, there is a false trend for crossing of
the phantom divide line w = −1 leading to phantom be-
havior which is not present in the underlying model (blue
dots). In addition the gradient of w(z) is signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from the gradient of the underlying model in both
low and in high redshifts indicating a false type of future
evolution for w(z).

All the parametrizations we have discussed so far with
the exception of nCPL (for n > 1) belong to the thawing
class and vary linearly with z at low z. Due to this lin-
ear dependence and the small number of parameters (2),
these parametrizations have diﬃculty to ﬁt functional
forms w(z) that vary as zn with n > 1 at low z as is the
case for freezing-tracking quintessence models. In fact all
the two parameter parametrizations that we were able to
ﬁnd in the literature are suﬀering from a similar problem
and are thus unable to eﬃciently ﬁt freezing models.

In Table I we show an extensive list of

such
parametrizations (including the ones above) appearing
in previous studies (i.e.
the Larkoz-Salzano-Sendra
sine parametrization [69], the Feng-Lu logarithmic one
[71], two models proposed by Ma-Zhang [61] and two
other models proposed by Feng-Shen-Li-Li [57]) along
with their q−value with respect to a typical thaw-
ing quintessence model (qth.) and with respect to a
typical freezing quintessence model (qfr.). Almost all
parametrizations (except nCPL) belong to the thaw-

quintessence model. In contrast the freezing parameter-
ization 7-CPL provides an excellent ﬁt to the freezing
model.

This is conﬁrmed quantitatively in Fig. 11 where we
show the value of the measure q for each parametriza-
tion, obtained for a range of potential parameter values
consistent with observations, at the 2σ level, with freez-
ing initial conditions. Clearly, q in this case behaves in
the opposite manner compared to the behavior of Fig. 9.

ity of ﬁt (lowest q) while the thawing parametrizations

ing class and are able to ﬁt well a thawing underlying
model (they have a low value of qth.). However, the only
parametrization with good ﬁt to a freezing model (low
qfr. value) is the nCPL parametrization with a high value
of n (we have used n = 7 here but other similar val-
ues of n are also providing similar good ﬁts). This is also
demonstrated in Fig. 12 where we show the best ﬁr forms
of all parametrizations to a typical freezing quintessence
model (dotted line) obtained by numerically solving the
dynamical system (2.8)−(2.10) with freezing initial con-
ditions for parameter values consistent with observations
at the 2σ level.

In view of the fact that w(z) parametrizations appear
to be divided in two distinct classes (interpolated by the
Linear parametrization iv of equation (1.7)), the follow-
ing question arises:

Given a cosmological dataset expressed as w(zi) with
1σ errors what is the optimal class of parametrizations
to use in order to avoid misleading conclusions about the
estimated behavior of the underlying cosmological model
and uncover possible improved quality of ﬁt with respect
to ΛCDM?

The answer to this question may be obtained by im-

ﬁt parametrizations in each case (one thawing (CPL)
and one freezing (7CPL)). The ﬁt was made using least
squares on the scattered Gaussian data points. Notice
that the best ﬁt parametrization is close to the underly-
ing model w(z) only in the case when the parametrization
is in the same class as the underlying quintessence model.
We next address the following question: How does the
estimated value of present day equation of state parame-
ter w(z = 0) depend on the type of parametrization used
to ﬁt the w(z) data?

In order to answer this question we ﬁt the simulated
data of Fig. 14a (thawing) and Fig. 14b (freezing) us-
ing the nCPL parametrization of equation (2.25) for dif-
ferent values of n. We have seen that for n = 1 the
parametrization reduces to the usual CPL which belongs
to the thawing class while for larger n the parametriza-
tion transforms to one in the freezing class. The best ﬁt
parameter value w0 is identical to the predicted value for
w(z = 0) in the context of the nCPL parametrization.
Thus, in Fig. 15 we plot the best ﬁt value of w0 (with 1σ
errors) as a function of n for an underlying thawing (left)
and for an underlying freezing model (right). The true
underlying value of w(z = 0) is also indicated in each plot
by a dashed line for comparison with the estimated value
of w0 as a function of n. For a thawing underlying model
(Fig. 15a) the standard CPL (n = 1) provides an excel-
lent estimate for the value of w0 = w(z = 0) while higher
values of n are less accurate. In contrast for a freezing
underlying model (Fig. 15b) the standard CPL provides
a poor estimate for the value of w(z = 0). For n = 1,
the true value is more than 2σ away from the estimated
value while for n = 7 (freezing parametrization) the es-
timated value of w0 is in excellent agreement with the
true value. We conclude that the use of a parametriza-
tion that is incompatible with the underlying model can
lead to signiﬁcant misleading conclusions regarding the
present value of the equation of state parameter.

A guide for the selection of the right parametrization
may be provided by using the AIC or the likelihood
for comparison of candidate parametrizations to be used
with a given set of w(z) data. In Fig. 16 we show a plot of
the AIC as a function of n corresponding to the quality of
ﬁt of nCPL to simulated data originating from a freezing
underlying model (blue line) and from a thawing under-
lying model (red line). For the case of a freezing underly-
ing model there is a minimum of AIC at n = 7 (preferred
value) while in the case of a thawing underlying model
the minimum of AIC is at n = 1 as expected. Therefore,
the AIC may be used as a criterion for the selection of the
suitable parametrization class corresponding to a given
dataset.

The simulated data used in this section are extensive
in redshift space and useful for testing our arguments
but they do not correspond directly to particular cosmo-
logical observations.
Instead they emerge as combined
constraints emerging from several datasets. Thus the
simulated scattered points do not correspond directly to
particular data points coming from a given cosmological

strated in the following section where we consider simu-
lated mock scattered data based on underlying thawing
or freezing models with errors corresponding to real data.

USING SIMULATED DATASETS AT THE LEVEL

OF w(z)

WMAP+SNLS+BAO+H(z) dataset [80] are shown in
Fig. 13.

equation of

As shown in Fig. 13 the constraints on w(z) are sig-
niﬁcantly more stringent for low redshifts z where there
are more data available. Since thawing models predict
more deviation from w = −1 at low z, these models are
strongly constrained to be close to ΛCDM. In contrast,
freezing models deviate from w = −1 at high z where
the constraints are weaker. Therefore this class of mod-
els is less constrained and is allowed to deviate more from
ΛCDM.

Using the errorbars in the redshift bins shown in
Fig. 13 we may generate scattered Gaussian mock data
in each redshift bin (we used 50 points in each bin)
with mean equal to the predicted value provided by a
quintessence model (thawing or freezing) and standard
deviation equal to the one indicated by the observational
constraints of Fig. 13.

These data are shown in Fig. 14 for a thawing un-
derlying model (left) and a freezing underlying model
(right) with parameters selected so that there is consis-
tency with observational constraints.
In the same ﬁg-
ure we show the numerically obtained w(z) of the un-
derlying quintessence cosmological model and two best

Besides the constraints of Fig. 13 (blue errorbars), we also include the underlying model (red line) along with the constraints

(green line) and the ΛCDM line (dashed). Notice on the left, the best ﬁt CPL is almost identical with the underlying thawing

dataset.

It would be desirable to test the two classes of
parametrizations we have proposed using simulations of
more realistic datapoints like Type Ia supernovae. Such
data points are more concentrated towards low redshifts
where the properties of the two parametrization classes
may not be as distinct. However, it is important to com-
pare parametrizations in the two classes using directly
simulated realistic data. Thus we focus on this approach
in the next section.

IV. SIMULATED DATASETS AT THE LEVEL

OF LUMINOSITY DISTANCE dL(z)

In order to compare the two classes of parametrizations
in more realistic data we construct simulated datasets
based on the Union 2.1 compilation. This compilation
consists of 580 datapoints expressed as distance moduli
in a redshift range z ∈ [0, 1.414].

There are three main signiﬁcant new features of this
compilation compared to the data used in the previous
section:

1. They are more realistic datapoints based on real
observations (SnIa) with error bars and without
the need for binning. Thus, in this case we do
not introduce a larger number of scattered points

to emulate a small number of binned data points
with errorbars. The number of the simulated data
points is the same as the number of the original
points and they have the same errorbars. Their
mean value however, is determined by the simu-
lated quintessence model.

2. Since these points originate from a single type of
cosmological observation they have a more limited
redshift range. They are more strongly biased to-
wards low redshifts (up to and z ∼ 0.8) and they
include no information from higher redshift probes
(e.g. CMB), as were the data used in the previous
section.

3. The data are presented at the level of the luminos-
ity distance dL(z), which is a directly measurable
quantity, and not at the level of the equation of
state w(z), which can only be inferred in practice
under certain assumptions, e.g. knowledge of Ωm
etc. Thus we have to convert the w parametriza-
tions w(z, w0, wa) to parametrizations of the form
dL(z, w0, wa) and for that we need to calculate the
dark energy density ρDE(z).

For a general equation of state w(z) the dark energy

density ρDE(z) is given by

With these in mind, we generate the simulated data
points by replacing each real distance modulus data by
a point with the same errorbars selected randomly using
a Gaussian probability distribution with standard devi-
ation equal to the 1σ error of the point and mean equal
to the value predicted by the quintessence model to be
simulated. In Fig. 17 we show a simulated dataset corre-
sponding to a freezing quintessence model (green points)
along with the actual Union 2.1 dataset (red points).

The theoretical distance moduli that are to be com-
pared with the observed distance moduli of the Union
2.1 compilation are written as

AIC as a function of n for an underlying freezing model

a thawing underlying model but n > 1 for a freezing
model. Thus it can be used for the selection of the pre-
ferred class of parametrizations. The AIC for the ΛCDM

pendence of AIC on n for the real Union 2.1 data is also

shown indicating a mild preference for n = 10. However,
even for n = 10 the AIC for ΛCDM is lower and therefore
ΛCDM remains a preferred model.

Notice however that ΛCDM appears to be a preferred
according to the AIC even in simulated data produced
for an underlying quintessence model. Therefore it ap-
pears that in the context of the Union 2.1 data the AIC
perhaps overpenalizes the additional two parameters and
is unable to identify the fact that the underlying model
deviates from ΛCDM.

ﬁt obtained directly with least squares from the underly-
ing curve w(z) using again nCPL with n = 1 and n = 4
(dashed and dotted lines, no simulated data in this case).
Notice that for the direct ﬁt to the underlying model the
value of the predicted value of w(z = 0) is signiﬁcantly
smaller than the true value. On the other hand the slope
of the ﬁt w(z) is roughly consistent with the true slope for
intermediate redshifts (z > 0.1). Thus, it this case where
there is uniform information over all redshifts probed,
the use of a unsuitable parametrization (n = 1) leads to
an incorrect value of w0 but approximately correct value
of the slope at intermediate z.

When the simulated Union 2.1 data are used for the ﬁt
the predicted value of w0 comes much closer to the true
value (see Fig. 19a). This result is obtained because the
SnIa data are heavily biased towards low redshifts and
any deviation from the true value of w0 is translated in
signiﬁcant increase of χ2. In this case, the error induced
by using the unsuitable parametrization is transferred
to the predicted slope of w(z) at relatively high redshift
(z ∈ [0.2, 1.2]) which is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the
true slope of w(z). Indeed for n = 1 the best ﬁt w(z) is
a decreasing function of z while the true underlying w(z)
is a rapidly increasing function (at relatively high z).

On the

suitable

contrary, when a

(freezing)
parametrization is used (n = 4), both the slope
and the value of w(z = 0) = w0 are in agreement
with the underlying freezing model as demonstrated in
Fig. 19a (left).

Corresponding conclusions for the case of a thawing
underlying model can be drawn by inspecting Fig. 19b
(right). In this case the suitable parametrization is thaw-
ing with n = 1 which provides good agreement for both
the slope and the present day value w(z = 0) = w0.
On the other hand, a freezing parametrization (n = 4)
provides approximately correct value for w(z = 0) = w0
(due to the increased density of datapoints at low z) but
an incorrect value of the slope of w(z) at high z.

Therefore, when cosmological data are biased towards

low redshifts, as is the case for the Union 2.1 data,
the basic misleading eﬀect of using an inappropriate
parametrization to ﬁt the data is not an incorrect value
for w0, but an incorrect value of the slope of w(z) at rel-
atively intermediate or high redshifts. To demonstrate
this fact, we show in Fig. 20a (left) a plot of the slope
of the best ﬁt w(z) over the true slope of the underlying
(freezing or thawing model) at z = 0.3, as a function of n.
Clearly, the best ﬁt slope deviates signiﬁcantly from the
true slope when an unsuitable parametrization is used
(n (cid:54)= 1 for thawing and n < 4 for freezing underlying
model). The best ﬁt slope of the actual Union 2.1 data
as a function of n is shown in Fig. 20b (right).

V. CONCLUSIONS-DISCUSSION

We have demonstrated that

the dark energy
parametrizations ﬁtting the equation of state parame-
ter w(z) may be divided in two classes depending on
their convexity properties. Based on these properties
we have divided these parametrizations in two classes:
thawing parametrizations and freezing parametrizations.
Each class is suitable for ﬁtting the corresponding class of
quintessence cosmological models or more general mod-
els with the same convexity. We have proposed a three
parameter parametrization (nCPL) that interpolates be-
tween the two classes of parametrizations by varying
one of its parameters (n) and reduces to the usual CPL
parametrization in its thawing limit (n = 1).

We have also shown that

the correct class of
parametrizations for a given cosmological dataset may
be identiﬁed using the nCPL parametrization for various
values of n and ploting the AIC (or the Likelihood) as
a function of n. The value of n that minimizes the AIC
can determine the correct class of parametrizations to be
used in the ﬁt and identiﬁes the most probable class of
the underlying cosmological model.

principal component analysis or null tests [92, 93]) may
be used to reconstruct w(z) using independent redshift
bins assuming that w(z) is constant in each bin. In this
case however it is more diﬃcult to extract information
about the slope of w(z) and future trends for its evolu-
tion.

Finally we have pointed out the misleading conclusions
that can be obtained if an unsuitable parametrization is
used to ﬁt a particular dataset. Such misleading conclu-
sions depend on the distribution of datapoints in red-
shift space.
If the dataset is strongly biased towards
low redshifts (like the Union 2.1 dataset) then the error
introduced on the estimated present day value of w(z)
is relatively small and depends weakly on the class of
parametrization used. However, in this case the use of
unsuitable parametrization estimate for the slope of w(z)
at relatively intermediate and leads to incorrect high red-
shifts. This error is drastically reduced with the use of a
parametrization of suitable class.

15

The Union 2.1 dataset has been shown to have a
weak minimum of the AIC for n = 10 but also better
overall agreement of the slope w(cid:48)(z = 0.3) with the
freezing quintessence mock data,
thus indicating a
mild preference for high values of n for the nCPL
parametrizations but also for the freezing quintessence
models. However the value of AIC for ΛCDM remains
signiﬁcantly lower at 568.284. This preference for a high
n nCPL parametrization and the freezing quintessence
models will become more clear in the future as the high
redshift data increase and the dataset becomes more
uniform at high z.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

On the other hand if a dataset is relatively uniform in
redshift space, then the slope of the best ﬁt w(z) depends
weakly on the class used but the estimated present value
of w(z) can be more than 2σ away from the true value if
an unsuitable parametrization is selected.
