Abstract

Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), linked with

CRISPR associated (CAS) genes, play a profound role in the interactions between

phage and their bacterial hosts.

It is now well understood that CRISPR-CAS sys-

tems can confer adaptive immunity against bacteriophage infections. However, the

possibility of failure of CRISPR immunity may lead to a productive infection by the

phage (cell lysis) or lysogeny. Recently, CRISPR-CAS genes have been implicated

in changes to group behaviour, including bioﬁlm formation, of the bacterium Pseu-

domonas aeruginosa when lysogenized. For lysogens with a CRISPR system, another

recent experimental study suggests that bacteriophage re-infection of previously lyso-

genized bacteria may lead to cell death. Thus CRISPR immunity can have complex

eﬀects on phage-host-lysogen interactions, particularly in a bioﬁlm.

In this contri-

bution, we develop and analyse a series of models to elucidate and disentangle these

interactions. From a therapeutic standpoint, CRISPR immunity increases bioﬁlm re-

sistance to phage therapy. Our models predict that lysogens may be able to displace

CRISPR-immune bacteria in a bioﬁlm, and thus suggest strategies to eliminate phage-

resistant bioﬁlms.

Introduction

The co-existence of bacteria and bacteriophage has been of prolonged interest to evolutionary

biologists [1]. Temperate phage are of particular interest as these viruses can reproduce

either through the lytic cycle, causing bacterial cell death, or the lysogenic cycle, allowing

both phage and host to survive [2, 7, 18, 56]. An important factor in this co-existence is a

mechanism known as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)

that not only provides adaptive immunity against viral infections but also helps to protect

the bacterial genome from foreign mobile elements such as phage and plasmids [11, 50].

The building blocks of CRISPR systems were ﬁrst identiﬁed thirty years ago, when inter-

spaced DNA repeats were found in speciﬁc regions of the E. coli genome [30]. Research

eﬀorts quantiﬁed the variation in these sequences, their lengths and positions, in bacterial

and archaea genomes [5, 9, 39] before the name CRISPR was ﬁrst applied [31]. CRISPR

systems have now been identiﬁed in nearly 45% of bacterial strains and have been classiﬁed

into three types that are further divided according to the phylogeny of the CRISPR sequences

and their CRISPR-associated (CAS) genes [11]. Moreover, multiple CRISPR-CAS systems

exist in several bacterial strains demonstrating that diﬀerent types are compatible with each

other within a single cell [16, 57].

The CRISPR adaptive defense mechanism proceeds in three main steps [11]. Firstly, the

CRISPR-CAS system requires a speciﬁc sequence in phage DNA known as the protospacer

that is acquired as a spacer into a designated position in the bacterial genome known as the

CRISPR-locus, which lies next to the CAS genes [8, 22]. This acquisition is made possible

by means of a short conserved sequence, present in the vicinity of protospacers, known as the

protospacer adjecent motif (PAM) [17, 42]. CRISPR-loci have the capacity to store hundreds

of spacers in the form of an array, while each spacer in the array is surrounded by short

palindromic repeats known as CRISPR-repeats [34]. In the second step, the CRISPR-locus

is transcribed and expressed as a single long mRNA that is cleaved into a single spacer and

partial repeat known as CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) [24]. Depending upon the type of CRISPR

system [11, 46], crRNA is associated with a CAS protein which provides a strong response

4

against any RNA/DNA sequences matching the protospacer and begins to cleave these viral

sequences with the help of CAS enzymes; this third step is known as interference. In the

case of subsequent infections by the same type of phage, the crRNA associated with the CAS

protein promptly responds and cleaves the phage genome. However, the presence of a limited

number of crRNA/CAS complexes inside the cell can lead to CRISPR failure in the case of

multiple simultaneous viral infections. Moreover, small variations in PAM can also lead to

immune failure resulting in phage infection. In addition, rapidly mutating phage can escape

this bacterial immunity by varying the protospacer or PAM sequences. A balance between

phage diversiﬁcation and CRISPR immunity can result in a stable co-existing community

[4, 28, 53].

Bioﬁlm formation is another protective mechanism used by bacterial colonies. For example,

P. aeruginosa preferentially exhibits an anaerobic bioﬁlm mode of growth at human body

temperature [54, 58].

In particular, when this pathogen colonizes wound infections (e.g.

suppurative or purulent bacterial infections) or the lungs of cystic ﬁbrosis patients [15, 48],

it forms micro-colony structures which exhibit extremely high levels of antibiotic resistance

[15]. Bacterial cells undergo profound phenotypic changes during the transition from free-

ﬂoating planktonic to bioﬁlm-associated cells [43].

New advancements in phage therapies are considered to be a promising way to eradicate

some otherwise untreatable bacterial infections [41, 45]. Although the therapeutic eﬀect of a

virulent phage is typically more eﬀective than a temperate phage [49], virulent phage therapy

is not always possible and therefore the use of temperate phage is sometimes inevitable

[12, 44, 47]. In particular, nearly 100% lysogenization can be achieved for P. aeruginosa when

exposed to some viruses, [36], but these lysogens are normally immune to super-infection and

plaque formation by the same phage [55].

Recent studies have revealed an eﬀect of the type-I CRISPR-CAS system on the regulation

of group behaviours in one strain of P. aeruginosa, PA14 [29, 59].

In particular, it has

been demonstrated that PA14 is unable to form bioﬁlm and loses swarming motility when

CRISPR-CAS identiﬁes a speciﬁc protospacer and PAM in a prophage sequence in the bac-

5

terial genome [29]. This result demonstrates that the CRISPR-CAS system, in addition to

its role as an adaptive immune response, can regulate the genomic content of bacteria and

help protect bacterial colonies from lysogenization; in fact, very few prophage are observed

in P. aeruginosa genomes that carry CRISPR systems [19, 37]. The regulation of bacterial

genomic content by means of the CRISPR-CAS system has been found in other bacterial

strains as well, in which not only is lysogeny prevented, but also existing prophage is tar-

geted, typically resulting in cell death due to genomic breakdown [19]. This self-destruction

of lysogens may protect colonies by reducing the chance of prophage induction.

The eﬀects of CRISPR-CAS systems on bacteria-phage interactions have been studied the-

oretically using a range of mathematical modelling approaches [14, 23, 26, 27, 35]. To date,

these models have been developed for virulent phage assuming that CRISPR systems func-

tion as adaptive immune systems, without aﬀecting other cellular processes such as bioﬁlm

formation [29, 59] or the cleavage of prophage [19]. In parallel with these eﬀorts, a number

of models have been developed to study the ecological eﬀects of bacterial group behaviours,

particularly bioﬁlm formation [6, 10, 20, 21, 33, 40]. Modelling eﬀorts directed toward phage

infection in bioﬁlms are relatively rare [1, 51].

The goal of this work is to investigate the eﬀects of a temperate phage infection in a bacterial

bioﬁlm. Our approach is to develop a series of models that help to isolate and disentangle

the roles of bacterial hosts, either with or without a CRISPR system, lysogens, and phage.

Not surprisingly, our models predict that CRISPR-immune bacteria in a bioﬁlm, such as P.

aeruginosa in cystic ﬁbrosis, will be diﬃcult to eradicate by phage therapy. However our

results suggest that lysogens without a functioning CRISPR system may in some parameter

regimes be able to invade and dominate the bioﬁlm, oﬀering a possible avenue for therapy.

2 Model

2.1 Model Formulation

We develop a series of three models to investigate the eﬀect of infection by temperate phage

on a bacterial bioﬁlm, for a host species either with or without a CRISPR-CAS system.

Motivated by predominantly single species bioﬁlms as seen in P. aeruginosa [29], all of the

models consider cells of a single bacterial species within a bioﬁlm. Each model has two

bacterial populations and a population of bacteriophage as described in the Figure 1. In the

ﬁrst model, the population dynamics of host cells, H, lysogenized host cells, HL and phage,

V , are studied in the absence of a CRISPR system. In the second model, a CRISPR system

is introduced; we consider CRISPR-immune host cells, CS, and lysogens with a CRISPR

system (but no phage-speciﬁc spacer) CL (Model 2). In the third model, CRISPR-immune

bacteria CS are considered along with lysogens without a CRISPR system. The ﬁrst case of

Model 3 describes the bioﬁlm in isolation whereas in the second case a constant population
of planktonic (free) lysogens ˆHL in the environment may join the bioﬁlm. The common

parameters of all three models are described as follows.

The bacterial populations are modelled as cell densities per unit area of bioﬁlm, cells/cm2.

These populations can increase logistically with a maximum growth rate r, but are limited

by a ﬁxed number of available attachment sites in the bioﬁlm matrix, given by carrying

capacity K cells/cm2. The bacteria leave the bioﬁlm with sloughing oﬀ rate η that may

diﬀer for CRISPR and non-CRISPR bacteria. We assume that the virus is able to diﬀuse

fairly freely through bioﬁlm channels, yielding mass action attachment kinetics. Thus, βHV

gives the number of adsorption events per unit time, and infected bacterial cells typically

undergo lysis, producing b daughter phage. The increase in the bacteriophage population is

regulated by the rate of phage dissolution, γ; it is assumed that this phage loss includes phage

particles diﬀusing from the bioﬁlm. We also impose the standard assumption that the loss of

phage via productive infection, βHV is negligible compared to the overall clearance rate γV .

Using these parameters, three systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) are analysed

7

below to predict which populations will persist at equilibrium for realistic parameter regimes.

CRISPR-CAS system, CL are lysogens with a CRISPR-CAS system. The bacterial populations H and HL
are considered in Model 1, CS and CL in Model 2 and HL and CS in Model 3.

2.2 Model 1

The ﬁrst model is comparatively simple and based on the classical phage-bacteria interaction

when there is no CRISPR system in the bacterial cells. Two bacterial populations are

considered, the wild-type H and lysogens HL, along with a phage population V . The phage

can attach to wildtype cells with adsorption rate β, aﬀecting the host cell in one of two

possible ways: (1) host cells H are lysogenized with probability pL, giving rise to lysogens
HL or (2) host cells are lysed with probability (1 − pL) which results in the production of a
burst of b phage.

In lysogens, prophage induction is possible at rate α which again results in cell lysis with

burst size b. We assume lysogenization confers complete immunity to the virus, that is, HL

8

cannot be infected. The model is represented by the following set of ODEs,

dH(t)

K (cid:19) HL + pLβHV − αHL − ηHL

dV (t)

= b (1 − pL) βHV − γV + bαHL

The purpose of this model is to study criteria for the stable existence of lysogens at equilib-

rium. This model clearly shows four steady states of which the ﬁrst is the trivial equilibrium

(TE1), in which all populations are zero. This is possible when the sloughing oﬀ rate η is

suﬃciently high to eradicate all bacteria from the bioﬁlm. The second equilibrium is the

phage free equilibrium (PFE1) in which only wild-type bacteria survive, given by

Clearly the existence criterion for steady state PFE1 is η < r. The third equilibrium is the

lysogenic equilibrium (LE1) in which lysogens survive but the wild-type bacteria die out.

These lysogens produce prophage by induction which results in the survival of the phage

population. However, these phage have no eﬀect on the bacterial population since lysogens

cannot be infected. The equilibrium LE1 is given by

where Rα = Kbα/γ. The existence condition for LE1 is η < r − α (note that PFE1 also exists
when this condition holds). Finally, there is an all existing equilibrium (AEE1) in which all

Rβ(cid:19) .

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian of each equilibrium provide stability conditions; these are

provided in detail in Appendix S1. We ﬁnd that TE1 is only stable when r < η, that is, if

the sloughing oﬀ rate exceeds the maximum growth rate of the bioﬁlm cells. For the local

stability of PFE1, the existence condition η < r ensures that the ﬁrst eigenvalue is negative.
Considering the second eigenvalue, we ﬁnd the stability condition η > r(1 − 1/Rβ ) for PFE1,
which holds when Rβ < 1. Rβ is analogous to a basic reproductive ratio for the phage, and

this result implies that when Rβ < 1, the disease-free state PFE1 is stable.

The stability conditions for LE1 are closely related to the conditions for PFE1 with an

additional dependence on the phage induction rate α; the condition for LE1 stability is
η < r(1 − 1/Rβ ) − α.
If we consider α to be suﬃciently small, then stability switches
between LE1 and PFE1 at η = r(1 − 1/Rβ ). Moreover, we see that Rβ > 1 must hold for
the stability of LE1. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian evaluated at AEE1 are complicated

analytical expressions, however, stability will be explored numerically in the next section.

The existence and stability criteria for each steady state in Model 1 are summarized in Table

2.

We note that, for biologically realistic parameter regimes, the phage induction rate α is

likely to be very small relative to r and η. Thus, AEE1 rarely exists, the existence criteria

for PFE1 and LE1 are eﬀectively identical, and their stability criteria are complementary.

The population can stably exist in three states:

if η > r the host cell population is not

determines whether the phage-free or lysogenic equilibrium is stable.

In agreement with

intuition, the PFE1 will be stable for Rβ < 1.

2.3 Model 2

In this model, we examine how the situation above might diﬀer if the bacterial strains

involved have CRISPR immunity. We thus assume that both the wild-type and lysogenized

cells have a CRISPR-CAS system, and denote these populations CS and CL respectively.

The ﬁrst population is assumed to have previously acquired the protospacer of phage DNA;

these CS cells are therefore CRISPR-immune. CRISPR-immune bacteria have the ability

to resist future infections by the same phage, however there is a small possibility of failure.

Therefore, in the case of phage adsorption by CS, the probability of CRISPR failure pF leads

the cell to lysis.

For lysogens with a CRISPR system, we note results from a recent experimental study [19]

which demonstrates that bacteriophage infection of previously lysogenized bacteria may lead

to cell death, if the CRISPR-CAS proteins acquire the protospacer of the infecting phage. In

this case, the same adsorption rate (β) is considered for the interaction between the bacterio-

phage V and lysogens CL, however this interaction is lethal to the cell with probability pD .

11

Finally, lysogens have a CRISPR-CAS system which regulates their group behaviour [29] so

that they lose the expression of polysaccharides essential for bioﬁlm formation. Therefore,

the sloughing oﬀ rate in CL increases (ηL > η). This dynamical system can be written as

dCS(t)

We begin by examining the existence conditions for equilibria of this model. Apart from

the trivial equilibrium (TE2 = (0, 0, 0)), there are four more equilibrium states: the phage

free equilibrium (PFE2) in which only CS survives, the lysogenic equilibrium (LE2) in which

CL and V survive, the CRISPR equilibrium (CE2) in which CS and V survive and the all

existing equilibrium (AEE2) in which all three populations exist. The ﬁrst three non-trivial

equilibria can be written as:

The existence conditions for the above equilibrium are quite complex as shown in Table 3,

however one necessary condition is pF > pD. Note that this is the only equilibrium whose

existence depends on the relation between the probabilities of CRISPR failure and cell death.

All these conditions admit the possibility of co-existence of equilibria and we thus consider

stability conditions from the eigenvalues of the Jacobian, as provided in Appendix S2. In

brief, for PFE2 we ﬁnd an analogous condition to that found in previous model for PFE1;

in particular, PFE2 is locally stable under the condition η > r(cid:16)1 − 1

second and third eigenvalues are complex conjugates with negative real parts whenever CE2

Rβ pF(cid:17). For CE2, the

exists, and we ﬁnd a necessary condition for the negativity of the ﬁrst eigenvalue. Similarly,

for LE2, the second and third eigenvalues are negative whenever the equilibrium exists but

we derive a condition for the negativity of the ﬁrst eigenvalue. Finally, the eigenvalues for the

Jacobian matrix of AEE2 are suﬃciently complicated expressions that we will use numerical

methods to assess stability. Table 3 shows a summary of existence and stability conditions

for Model 2.

We ﬁnd that the conditions for the stable existence of the trivial and phage-free equilibria

are identical to those described for Model 1, with Rβ replaced by Rβ pF . Thus again if the

sloughing oﬀ rate exceeds the growth rate, the bioﬁlm cannot sustain itself. If the bioﬁlm can

13

sustain itself, we ﬁnd that the phage population cannot be sustained if Rβ pF < 1. If both

the bacterial cells and phage are sustainable, however, three equilibrium states are possible.

Once again, though, we note that α is very small, and thus the lysogenic equilibrium is rarely

stable, since η < ηL by deﬁnition. The all existing equilibrium again has a possibly narrow

parameter range for existence, and thus the model predicts that for biologically relevant

parameter values, the CRISPR equilibrium is most likely to be observed. This is illustrated

further in the numerical work to follow.

2.4 Model 3

This model consists of a population of CRISPR-immune bacteria CS along with non-CRISPR

lysogens HL which continually contribute to the phage population V in the bioﬁlm via

induction. The populations and parameters are the same as described for the previous

models, with the exception of the bioﬁlm formation rate φ. The idea here is to study the

impact of a population of non-CRISPR lysogens HL on the population of CRISPR-immune

bacteria CS. This would allow us to investigate the possibility of using lysogens to deliver

phage therapy, with the long-term goal of eradicating the CRISPR-immune bacteria.

Since the lysogens HL do not have a CRISPR-CAS system, it is possible for planktonic

lysogens to express polysaccharides and join the outer layer of the bioﬁlm. The model

assumes that planktonic bacteria are present in the environment around the bioﬁlm, allowing

planktonic bacteria to form bioﬁlm at a speciﬁc rate constant of adhesion while the medium

carrying planktonic bacteria ﬂows into and out of the system, including the sloughed oﬀ

bacteria from the bioﬁlm. We use φ to denote the maximum rate of bioﬁlm formation by

planktonic bacteria; this rate is reduced by the carrying capacity such that the net bioﬁlm

formation rate depends on the attachment sites available in the bioﬁlm. We assume that

bacteria are lost from the bioﬁlm independent of the density of planktonic bacteria; this

sloughing oﬀ rate is assumed to be the same for both CS and HL. The model is represented

14

by the following equations,

dCS(t)

CS + HL

K (cid:19) CS − pF βCSV − ηCS

=(cid:18)1 −

CS + HL

K (cid:19) (rHL + φ) − αHL − ηHL

(8)

dV (t)

dt

= bpF βCSV − γV + bαHL

The above system is studied in two cases: (1) when there are no planktonic lysogens in the

environment (φ = 0) and (2) when there are lysogens in the environment that may join the

bioﬁlm (φ > 0).

Case (a): φ = 0

When the bioﬁlm formation term φ = 0, this model becomes relatively simple, yielding

four steady states, three of which are deﬁned in the previous model, i.e.

the phage-free

equilibrium (P F E3), trivial equilibrium (T E3) and CRISPR equilibrium (CE3) with the

population of lysogens HL in place of CL, while the fourth equilibrium, i.e. the lysogenic

LE3, is as deﬁned for LE1 with CS = 0 instead of H = 0.

The eigenvalues of the Jacobian evaluated at these equilibria are given in Appendix S3, and

the existence and stability conditions are summarized in Table 4. There are similarities in the

stability conditions of each equilibrium of this model with those described for the previous

models. In particular the stability conditions for the trivial and phage-free equilibria are

the same as previously described for Model 2. In this case since α is small, the CRISPR

equilibrium has a narrow range of stability, and bioﬁlms are thus most likely to exist either

at the phage-free or lysogenic equilibria.

15

2.4.1 Case (b): φ > 0

This situation changes when planktonic lysogens in the environment are able to join the

bioﬁlm. When φ > 0, only two equilibria remain. One is the lysogenic equilibrium (LEφ)

and the other is the all existing equilibrium (AEEφ). Equilibrium LEφ is given by:

It can be observed that the lysogens and phage population are always positive because the

For the stability of LEφ, a complex condition arises from the ﬁrst eigenvalue, as given in

Appendix S3. However, the following condition is suﬃcient to ensure the stability of LEφ:
Kα(r − η) − ηφ < 0 which implies that φ > Kα(r−η)

evaluated numerically

Model 3 has been developed to investigate the possibility of using lysogenized bacteria as a

delivery mechanism in phage therapy. Without the addition of lysogenized bacteria (φ = 0),

the most likely stable equilibrium for the realistic parameter values is PFE3, particularly
when Rβ < 1
pF

; this corresponds to a bioﬁlm composed of bacteria that are immune to the

phage. However the stability conditions for the two equilibria when φ > 0 imply that when

the rate of bioﬁlm formation by lysogenized bacteria is suﬃciently high, the population of

CRISPR-immune bacteria may be eliminated from the bioﬁlm.

3 Numerical Simulations

Numerical simulations for the above models have been performed to illustrate the impact

of parameter values on the existence and stability of the steady states.

In addition, the

eigenvalues for the Jacobian at two all existing equilibria (AEE1 and AEEφ) which were not

provided analytically are illustrated numerically.

17

3.1 Parameter values

Baseline parameters were obtained through a review of experimental results in the literature

as well as parameter values used in previous mathematical modeling studies (Table 2) [3, 14,

21, 32, 36, 38]. The rate of bacterial growth r = 1 hr−1 is the maximum growth rate [1, 14]

in the logistic growth term; growth slows at higher densities. The carrying capacity of the

bacterial population inside the bioﬁlm is the total attachment sites available per unit area.
We take K = 5 × 106 cells/cm2 as chosen by Freter [21] and followed by [6] and [40].

We assume lysogens leave the cell population by means of prophage induction at the rate

α = 10−5 hr−1, producing b = 200 phage copies per cell through lysis. Phage can infect

bacteria at the rate β = 10−7 cm2 phage−1 hr−1 and produce b = 200 phage copies per cell
with probability 1 − pL, where pL = 0.05 is the probability of bacteria gaining prophage.
The phage loss rate is assumed to be γ = 0.05 hr−1 which includes phage dissolution and

sloughing oﬀ from the bioﬁlm.

Bioﬁlm formation and sloughing oﬀ are frequently discussed in the literature [6, 21, 40]. In

this article, the sloughing oﬀ rate of bacteria is the same in all models, except that lysogens

in Model 2, CL, leave the bioﬁlm more rapidly due to the CRISPR response. The baseline

parameter value for the sloughing oﬀ rate for wildtype bacteria is taken to be η = 0.1
hr−1 and for lysogens with a CRISPR system is given by ηL = √η so that ηL > η when
0 < η < 1. The parameter value for the bioﬁlm formation rate φ is found from Freter’s model

by assuming that the density of bacteria present near the bioﬁlm is constant as K2 = 108
cells⁄cm3. The adhesion rate given in Freter’s model, i.e. ˜θ = 10−5 m3/hr/gram, is converted
to θ = ˜θK2 hr−1 ≈ 5.56 × 10−7/hr by assuming that 1 gram of bacterial mass can contain
N = 1.8 × 1012 cells at maximum. Therefore, the population forming bioﬁlm per hour is
given by φ = θK cells/cm2/hr, where K is the carrying capacity of the bioﬁlm.

The CRISPR-CAS eﬀects on the wild-type bacteria and lysogens are parametrised so that

they reﬂect biologically plausible dynamics. Since CRISPR immunity is considered highly

eﬃcient with a small probability of failure, we take pF = 10−4 [14]. The probability of

18

failure is a key measure in the models, allowing us to study phage infection in CRISPR-CAS

bacteria. Failure is possible since the diversity in CRISPR arrays alters the eﬀectiveness of

the CRISPR-CAS system. In particular, CRISPR spacers may become less eﬀective over time

and therefore older spacers are preferentially replaced [52, 25]. The probability of death pD

depends on the adsorption rate of lysogens in the presence of CRISPR-CAS, the presence of

repressors for the phage and the diversity of CAS proteins inside CRISPR-immune bacteria.

In this study, the same adsorption rate is assumed for lysogens and non-lysogens, while

pD = 0.1 is used to model CRISPR-CAS initiated cell death.

3.2 Baseline analysis

In Figure 2, the population dynamics of each of these models are illustrated for the same

baseline parameter values and initial conditions. The simulations are run over long times to

illustrate stable equilibrium states, and in each case the numerical results were validated by

19

comparison with the analytical expressions. We plot both population densities and time on

a log axis, such that initial transients are visible.

In the ﬁrst model, the baseline scenario produces a stable lysogenic equilibrium (without

CRISPR), in which the phage population is maintained in the bioﬁlm through induction.

This is a classical model which supports the idea of co-existence of temperate phage and

their bacterial hosts. This result should generalize to the case of many phage types, since

bacteria are capable of carrying several prophage as part of their genome.

In the second model, the CRISPR bacteria CS clearly dominate, since CRISPR immunity

makes these cells resistant to the phage. The CRISPR eﬀects on the lysogens CL, i.e. the

death of lysogens or increase in the sloughing-oﬀ rate, make it possible to eliminate these

infected bacteria from the bioﬁlm; their loss is followed by the loss of the phage population.

The second model demonstrates that CRISPR systems will disrupt the coexistence observed

in Model 1, and predicts that for bacteria with CRISPR systems, stable bioﬁlms are likely

to be composed of CRISPR-immune bacteria only.

The populations in the ﬁrst two models reach stable equilibria fairly quickly, whereas sim-

ulation results for the third model show that the populations take longer to reach their

stable states. In the absence of an external source of lysogens (Model 3a), CRISPR-immune

bacteria dominate, since the CRISPR system helps the bacteria to maintain the phage-free

equilibrium after eliminating non-CRISPR lysogens from the bioﬁlm. When the external

source of lysogens is present (Model 3b), we observe stability of the all existing equilibrium

for these baseline parameter values. This is because a high bioﬁlm formation rate is required

to meet the suﬃcient condition for the stability of LEφ, thus eliminating the CRISPR cells

from the bioﬁlm. To investigate this further, we turn to parametric analysis to explore sce-

narios in which lysogens are able to replace CRISPR-immune bacteria in the bioﬁlm. The

second goal of the parametric analysis is to ﬁnd a suitable conditions at which, after the erad-

ication of CRISPR bacteria from the bioﬁlm, the lysogens themselves could be eradicated.

(AEEφ).

3.3 Parametric analysis

In this section we illustrate several bifurcations that may occur in biologically realistic pa-

rameter regimes. We ﬁrst illustrate the changes in equilibria and stability that result from

variation in the adsorption rate, β. Variation in the prophage induction rate, α, phage loss

rate, γ, and sloughing oﬀ rate η have similar qualitative eﬀects and are shown in Appendix

S4. Finally, we examine the interesting case of variation in the bioﬁlm formation rate, φ.

21

Adsorption rate β

Variation in the adsorption rate constant aﬀects the stability of equilibrium states by varying

Rβ . Figure 3 shows that LE1 remains stable for a wide range of β values in Model 1, while the

other models each switch stability between two equilibrium states at high rates of adsorption.

In Model 2, PFE2 is replaced by CE2 at high adsorption rates. This is due to the strong

immune response of CRISPR bacteria, such that even for high adsorption rates CRISPR-

immune bacteria survive, co-existing with the phage.

In Model 3, LE2 is stable at high β, replacing PFE3 in case (a) and AEEφ in case (b). We

note that the bioﬁlm formation rate φ does not have a strong inﬂuence here, since almost

same adsorption rate β is required in both cases to eradicate CRISPR-immune bacteria.

Qualitatively, these results demonstrate that for bioﬁlms without CRISPR systems (Model

1), lysogens and phage are predicted to coexist over a wide parameter range. In contrast,

for bioﬁlms with CRISPR (Model 2), the stable equilibrium state is typically dominated by

CRISPR-immune bacteria. If CRISPR-capable lysogens are replaced by lysogens without a

functioning CRISPR system (Model 3, a and b), again CRISPR-immune bacteria typically

dominate, although for parameter regimes that are extremely favourable to phage reproduc-

tion, the lysogenic equilibrium may be stable. As shown in Appendix S4, these qualitative

conclusions also hold for variations in parameters α, η and γ.

23

Bioﬁlm formation rate φ

In Model 3, the rate of bioﬁlm formation by planktonic lysogens is an important parameter

that can be regulated either by increasing the density of lysogens near the bioﬁlm or by

increasing the adhesion rate. We illustrate the eﬀect of varying this parameter in panel

(a) of Figure 4. As the value φ increases, the lysogen population increases along with the

phage, while the population of CRISPR-immune bacteria CS decreases in the bioﬁlm, and is

eventually eliminated at high values of φ. Though a relatively large formation rate is required

to eliminate CS, this threshold value depends on other model parameters. In particular, the

critical φ value to ensure the stability of the lysogenic equilibrium in Model 3 (case (b)) is
give by φ > Kα (r−η)

. In the lower three panels of Figure 4 we plot this threshold against

η

α, η and the carrying capacity K. Clearly, an increase in the value of α and K require an

increase in the value of φ to make the lysogenic equilibrium stable, whereas an increase in

the sloughing oﬀ rate η reduces the threshold value of φ.

4 Discussion

We explore the dynamics of lysogenic phage in a bacterial bioﬁlm, for bacterial hosts both

with and without CRISPR immunity. Classical models of phage-bacteria interactions have

previously demonstrated that lysogeny can promote the stable co-existence of bacteria and

phage [13]. In agreement with these ﬁndings, Model 1 explores the baseline conditions under

which lysogeny exists in a bioﬁlm, and provides conditions for the stability of a lysogenic

equilibrium. The second and third models demonstrate the powerful eﬀect of the CRISPR-

CAS system in comparison with the non-CRISPR bacterial population in the ﬁrst model.

25

The second model predicts that at realistic parameter values, only prophage-free CRISPR-

immune bacteria stably survive in a bacterial bioﬁlm. In rare cases, the CRISPR system

stably co-exists with the phage, however the CRISPR system does not allow lysogens to

co-exist at this equilibrium.

In the third model, there is no CRISPR system present in

the lysogens. In the absence of an external source of lysogens (case (a)), CRISPR-immune

bacteria are predicted to dominate the bioﬁlm. However if an external source of planktonic

lysogens contributes to the bioﬁlm, CRISPR bacteria may co-exist with lysogens or can even

be eliminated from the bioﬁlm. This last result is of clinical relevance because CRISPR

bacteria are highly resistant to phage therapy. Once CRISPR bacteria are removed from the

bioﬁlm, phage therapy has a much higher chance of success.

The existence and stability conditions were found analytically to deﬁne the parametric re-

gions in which populations exist or remain stable.

In order to visualize the population

behaviour in the biologically meaningful parameter space, computer simulations were used

to verify the stability conditions. In addition, parametric analysis was used to explore real-

istic parameter regimes, and to deﬁne therapeutic strategies to eradicate CRISPR-immune

bacteria from the bioﬁlm. These results indicate that large magnitude changes in any one

baseline parameter value would be required to achieve that objective. This suggests that

means of varying several parameters simultaneously might hold more therapeutic promise.

In the ﬁrst model, the lysogenic equilibrium is typically stable for realistic parameter values.

This equilibrium (LE1) loses stability when β <

γr

Kb(r−η−α) .

If we consider the sloughing

oﬀ rate η and prophage induction rate α to be negligible compared to the growth rate r,

then this condition reduces to β < γ

Kb or Rβ < 1 which ensures the stability of PFE1. In
between the regions of stability of LE1 and PFE1, there is a small region of length α where

AEE1 exists. Although the biological relevance of this region is arguable, we provide some

numerical explorations in Figure S1.

The second model predicts that the CRISPR response is suﬃciently strong to eliminate

lysogens, and therefore CRISPR-immune bacteria dominate the bioﬁlm over a wide range of

parameter values. At high infection rates (i.e. β > γ

KbpF

), assuming the sloughing oﬀ rate is

26

negligible compared to the bacterial growth rate, a stable CRISPR equilibrium CE2 exists.

This predicts that the phage may exist at high adsorption rates, while lysogen survival is

unlikely unless the death probability pD goes to zero and sloughing oﬀ rates ηL and η become

equal. These two conditions would only hold in the unlikely scenario that the CRISPR system

has no eﬀect on the lysogens.

The third model explored the case of non-CRISPR lysogens and CRISPR-immune non-

lysogens. At baseline parametric values, the lysogens are predicted to go extinct, while the

CRISPR-immune bacteria stably exist inside the bioﬁlm. In some more extreme parameter

regimes, lysogens also persist at equilibrium. The corresponding eigenvalues show that the

stability of LE3 and PFE3 have almost complementary conditions, although a small region
of bi-stability exists, i.e. r − η < γr

< r − η − α.

KbβpF

Case (b) of Model 3 was speciﬁcally designed to explore the possibility of using lysogens

to penetrate the bioﬁlm and reduce the population of CRISPR-immune bacteria. A high

rate of bioﬁlm formation is necessary to eliminate CRISPR-immune bacteria CS in this

case; both lysogens and phage are always present in the bioﬁlm because of their continuous

inﬂux through ﬂow. Although our model treats only one type of virus and corresponding

prophage, an interesting possibility here is that diverse prophage could be introduced via

the lysogens joining the bioﬁlm. In this way, lysogens could produce a number of diﬀerent

viruses via induction, and this could ultimately reduce the entire bioﬁlm population. Since

older CRISPR spacers in the bacteria become less eﬃcient, the possibility of CRISPR failure

increases with phage diversity, which helps to eradicate CRISPR-immune bacteria CS. Once

CRISPR bacteria have been eliminated, the bioﬁlm can be treated by classical therapeutic

techniques.

Although the arguments above are highly speculative, the main results of our research are

summarized in Figure 5 which is divided into four panels (vertical lines). On the left, we

use Model 2 to simulate a pathogenic bioﬁlm that is resistant to phage therapy because it

consists entirely of CRISPR-immune bacteria. In the second panel, an external, possibly

therapeutic source of planktonic lysogens is applied, and the all existing equilibrium state

27

emerges. When the concentration of lysogens in the external source is further increased

(3rd panel), the CRISPR-immune bacteria are eradicated from the bioﬁlm and the model

shows the same behaviour as Model 1 with only lysogens and phage surviving. At realistic

baseline parameters, the lysogenic equilibrium emerges. Once the CRISPR population has

been eliminated, the external source of lysogens can be removed and Models 3 and 1 are

equivalent. Variations in a number of parameter values can then be used to eliminate the

lysogens (panel 4). For example, as mentioned above, diversity in the prophages carried

by lysogens could produce a number of distinct phage populations inside the bioﬁlm, which

could infect bacteria and also increase the prophage induction rate. Extending the analysis

presented here to include multiple phage types is an intriguing possibility for future work.

that there can be no oscillation. Furthermore, the ﬁrst and the third eigenvalues are always

parameter space allows for the stable existence of AEE1. Although the biological relevance

of this regime is limited, a brief numerical exploration reveals that a stable limit cycle, stable

node, or instability are all possible, depending on the initial conditions and the sloughing oﬀ

rate η (see Figure S1).

S4 Supplementary Section: Parameter values

Prophage induction rate α

The induction rate was varied to investigate its eﬀectiveness against the CRISPR and non-

CRISPR lysogens in the bioﬁlm (see Figure S2). In the case of competition between non-

CRISPR bacterial populations, i.e. Model 1, variations in α had no eﬀect; the lysogenic

equilibrium remains stable. Likewise, in the presence of a CRISPR system, Model 2, lysogens

die out due to the death and sloughing oﬀ rates regardless of the value of α; this result holds

for Model 3a as well.

In case (b) of Model 3, we see that at low rates of prophage induction, i.e. α < ηφ/K(r − η),

the lysogenic equilibrium is stable. As the lysogen lifetime is reduced due to increases in

prophage induction, the population of CRISPR-immune bacteria also emerges.

Model 2 and CS and HL in Model 3. The phage population is represented by V (red).

Rate of Phage loss γ

For the non-CRISPR populations, Model 1, the lysogenic equilibrium is stable at all bio-

logically meaningful values for the rate of phage loss, as shown in Figure S3 (top-left plot),

and the all existing equilibrium is never stable, even at very high rates of γ. On the other

hand, CRISPR immunity makes it possible for non-lysogens to stably exist at most plausible

values of γ, although for very low γ the CRISPR equilibrium (CE2) is stable in Model 2. In

Model 3a, CRISPR bacteria again dominate most of the parameter space (see Figure S3).

In case (b) of Model 3, the external lysogens joining the bioﬁlm do not stabilize LEφ sig-

41

niﬁcantly; the lysogenic equilibrium is only stable for γ < 0.01. For most values of γ, the

lysogens exist along with a population of CRISPR-immune bacteria and a decreasing density

of phage in the bioﬁlm, which is an obvious consequence of increasing phage loss.

Sloughing oﬀ rate η

The sloughing oﬀ rate is an important parameter in analyzing the stability of each model

since it weakens the bacterial population by increasing its rate of loss from the bioﬁlm.

The stability of the steady states are very similar to those observed in the above parameter

analyses. In general, we see that an increase in the sloughing oﬀ rate η reduces the population

of bacteria and phage in the bioﬁlm, leading at very high rates to the trivial equilibrium

(TE). This is because when η approaches r, all the populations go extinct as shown in Figure

S4.

The sloughing oﬀ rate η aﬀects lysogens either at the same rate as CRISPR-immune bacteria

(Model 3a) or at the higher rate (Model 2). Moreover, in case (b) of Model 3, it can be

observed that CRISPR-immune bacteria are eliminated from the bioﬁlm before η reaches

r = 1, while the lysogens persist because the planktonic lysogens are continuously joining the

bioﬁlm. Since there are only two steady states in this case, the parametric value satisfying

η > Kαr/Kα + φ is suﬃcient to eradicate the CRISPR-immune bacteria from the bioﬁlm.

Among the parameters involved in the inequality, φ seems to be an important parameter

which can be increased to eradicate CS even at comparatively low values of η.
