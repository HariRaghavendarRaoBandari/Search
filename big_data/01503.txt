A discretization of the wave-number space using a self-similar, alternating,

dodecahedral/icosahedral basis for the Navier-Stokes equation.

A discretization of the wave-number space of the Navier-Stokes equation, using a logarithmically
spaced “chain” of alternating icosa-dodeca-hedral spheres is proposed. This strange choice allows
the possibility of forming triangles using only discretized wave-vectors when the scaling between
two consecutive dodecahedra is equal to the golden ratio, and the icosahedron between the two
dodecahedra is the dual of the inner dodecahedron. Alternatively, the same discretization can
be described as a logarithmically spaced (with a scaling equal to the golden ratio) dodecahedron-
icosahedron compounds. A wave-vector which points from the origin to a vertex of such a mesh,
can always ﬁnd two other discretized wave-vectors that are also on the vertices of the mesh (which
is not true for an arbitrary mesh). For each vertex (i.e. discretized wave-vector) in this space, there
are either 9 or 15 pairs of vertices (i.e. wave-vectors) with which the initial vertex can interact to
form a triangle. This allows the reduction of the convolution integral in the Navier-Stokes equation
to a sum over 9 or 15 interaction pairs. Transforming the equation in Fourier space, to a network of
“interacting” nodes, that can be constructed as a numerical model, which evolves each component of
the velocity vector on each node of the network. Such a model gives the usual Kolmogorov spectrum
of k−5/3. Since the scaling is logarithmic, and the number of nodes for each scale is constant, a very
large inertial range (i.e. very high Reynolds numbers) can be considered with a much lower number
of degrees of freedom in such a model.

Turbulence is a complex phenomenon involving chaotic
behaviour in a range of scales. Yet, it has important
underlying symmetries and regularities. Both its unpre-
dictable nature, and its regular hierarchical structure is
a result of the form of the nonlinear interactions. There-
fore, the study of turbulence is a study of the nonlinear
interaction, and the attempt to understand the hierar-
chical structure of the underlying symmetries it implies
and their limitations[1].

While the simple picture of a turbulent cascade, in-
troduced by Kolmogorov, involves interactions between
diﬀerent “scales” (i.e. wave-number magnitudes k) of
a conserved quantity, the Navier-Stokes equation does
not readily uphold this picture. One usually has to
write down the equation for a conserved quadratic quan-
tity, such as energy or kinetic helicity, and assume
statistical isotropy, homogeneity etc.
in order to ar-
rive at a description consistent with the basic cascade
picture[2]. However, it is clear that the nonlinear cas-
cade happens in the original equation, even without
these assumptions. For instance, even without any as-
sumption of isotropy, the energy is transferred from
wave-number to wave-number.
If one uses a repre-
sentation of the wave-vector in spherical polar coor-
dinates in k-space [i.e.
using k, θk, φk, such that
(kx, ky, kz)=(k sin θk cos φk, k sin θk sin φk, k cos θk) ], one
could describe how the energy was being transfered from
k to k′, which is closely related, to what we call the “cas-
cade”, even if it is not the only thing that is implied by
the nonlinear interaction.

It is therefore tempting to imagine a discretization
of the k space using some form of spherical polar co-
ordinates, which would assign the phenomenon of non-

linear cascade to a particular direction k. Further-
more, one may introduce a logarithmic discretization
in this direction, so that with only a small number of
points, one may cover a large range in k. Cascade mod-
els that use a logaritmic discretization, or shell mod-
els (see for example Ref.
[3]), are simpliﬁed models
that try to exploit this particular aspect of the geom-
etry of the turbulent cascade. Here we present a direct
discretization of the Navier-Stokes equation in k-space
on a special mesh constructed from self-similarly scaled

dodecahedron-icosahedron compounds (i.e. Wenninger
model index 47 [4]), which has interesting properties. For
instance, as we will show below, it allows the possibility
of forming triangles using only discretized wave-vectors
when the scaling between two consecutive dodecahedron-
icosahedron compounds is equal to the golden ratio.
Consider Navier-Stokes equation in Fourier space:

We propose a discretization of the k space using a loga-
rithmic alternating icosahedral/dodecahedral basis:

icosahedron, while Nℓ=20 for the dodecahedron). This
symmetry can be used to reduce the number of degrees
of freedom by half. Otherwise, one must pay attention
that the initial conditions as well as all the terms in the
equation (such as forcing, dissipation etc.) respect this
symmetry.

Three dimensional turbulence requires solving three
vector components of the velocity. Here we use cartesian
coordinates uk = u(x)
nℓˆxi. In
kn ˆkℓ
this representation, the Navier-Stokes equation becomes:

ˆx + u(y)

where θℓ and φℓ are to be picked from the angles cor-
responding to the icosahedral and the dodecahedral ver-
tices, listed in table I.

Note that by enumerating the vertices of the icosahe-
dron and the dodecahedron, we reduce the number of
indices necessary to describe a given wave-vector from 3
to 2 (i.e. using only n and ℓ, we can deﬁne a unique
wave-vector). It is also important to mention that since
the original velocity ﬁeld v (x, t) is real, its Fourier trans-
form has the symmetry that v (k, t) = v∗ (−k, t). The
assignment of numbers to vertices are picked such that
ˆkℓ+Nℓ/2 = −ˆkℓ where Nℓ is the number of vertices of
the polyhedron in consideration (i.e. Nℓ = 12 for the

consider three consecutive spherical shells such that n′ =
n − 1 and n′′ = n + 1, and take alternating spheres to
be discretized as dodecahedrons and icosahedrons (i.e.
n = 1 is an icosahedron, n = 2 is a dodecahedron, n = 3
is icosahedron and so on), we can write:

which can be shifted in n (i.e. n → n + 1 and n →

interactions don’t correspond to grid points.

Where the coeﬃcients of ˆx and ˆy can be made to vanish

by choosing g = √ϕ = q(cid:0)1 + √5(cid:1) /2, while in order to
gnk0 as λ =q √5

make the coeﬃcient of ˆz vanish, we need to choose the
scaling of the radius of the icosahedron with respect to
3 . This way we can satisfy the condition
of the triad. One interesting point is that, the icosahe-
dron that is constructed this way is actually nothing but
the dual icosahedron of the inner dodecahedron with the
radius kn−1. While these two can be thought of as being
on separate shells in k-space, since their radii are diﬀer-
ent. They could also be thought of sampling a single shell
together in the form of a dodecahedron-icosahedron com-
pound (the shell boundary in this case would actually be
in between the two consecutive compounds).

Of course one can rotate the triangle around the
primary vector k to obtain another interacting pair.
For instance for the node ℓ = 0, the condition of
the triad will be satisﬁed by the pairs {ℓ′, ℓ′′} =

the interacting pairs of dodecahedral vertices for each
vertex of the icosahedron using the same algorithm. The
node-pair connections obtained this way are given in ta-
bles II and III.

which is automatically satisﬁed with g = √ϕ and
λ = q√5/3. Note again that the above condition
for ℓ = 0 is also satisﬁed by the pairs: {ℓ′, ℓ′′} =
[{4, 6} ,{9, 7} ,{11, 8}]. Similarly as the case where the
icosahedron was in the middle, we can ﬁnd the rest of
the interacting pairs of icosahedral vertices for each ver-
tex of the dodecahedron by rotating the mesh.

Since exchanging (n′, ℓ′) ↔ (n′′, ℓ′′), another interac-
tion is obtained, we will consider this explicitly by sym-
metrizing the equations as:

n,ℓ + iM κij

This way we can go over each node-pair connection
once, without paying attention to the sign, and all pos-
sible interactions will be covered. Deﬁning n as the
ﬂattened node number (e.g. {n, ℓ} = {3, 3} → n =
12 × 2 + 20 + 3 = 47, if the ﬁrst shell is an icosahedron),
instead of the shell number as before.

shown in ﬁgure 2). These connections can be obtained
using the tables II and III and the ﬂattening rule m =
ﬂoor (n/2)×32+(n mod 2)×Nf s +ℓ (and then m → n),
where Nf s is the number of vertices of the ﬁrst shell, and
can be thought of as a regular network model (see ﬁgure
2). Note that, in (5) the interaction matrix M κij
nℓ → M ikj
n
is also ﬂattened the same way as the vector ui
nℓ → ui
n .
The model, which consists of interacting node-pair con-
nections of the vertices of a dodecahedron-icosahedron
compound such that the wave-vectors of the three nodes
form a triangle, solves for all three components of the
velocity ﬁeld, with an interaction matrix M κij
repre-
nℓ
senting the Navier-Stokes equation.
In order to imple-
ment this model, it makes sense to use an object ori-
ented approach, where each node has a list of its con-
necting pairs, as can be inferred from Tables II and
III (as seen in ﬁgure 2), and so that a sum over these
pairs can be computed rapidly. The resulting model is
a stiﬀ set of ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs) on
an exponantially coarse grid, somewhat similar to the
2D model discussed in Ref.
[5]. We used a standard,
ﬁxed time step, 4th order Adams-Bashforth solver using
a c++ ODE library called odeint[6]. An initial sample
implementation is distributed as an open source solver
at http://github.com/gurcani/dins. The ﬁnal result

We thus conclude that the dodecahedron-icosahedron
compound discretization of the Navier-Stokes equation
that is proposed in this paper gives the expected wave-
number spectrum k−5/3 of Kolmogorov and can possi-
bly be used to study turbulence spectra in Navier-Stokes
turbulence. More careful studies as well as the ap-
plication to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence,
where the structure of turbulence is expected to be more
anisotropic, and the transition to 2D turbulence in the
limit of strong magnetic ﬁeld (or rotation) is left to future
studies. When applied to a system that supports waves
(i.e.
linearly), such a network model can be suitable to
study various phenomena including synchronization[7],
small world or scale freedom[8] since it can be thought of
a complex network of coupled oscillators[9]. The advan-
tage of a formulation based on logarithmic scaling with
a constant number of nodes per scale is that a very large
inertial range (i.e. very high Reynolds numbers) can be
considered with a much lower number of degrees of free-
dom.
