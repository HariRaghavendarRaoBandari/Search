THE MONGE-AMP`ERE EQUATION FOR

NON-INTEGRABLE ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES

JIANCHUN CHU, VALENTINO TOSATTI, AND BEN WEINKOVE

Abstract. We show existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Monge-
Amp`ere equation on compact almost complex manifolds with non-integrable
almost complex structure.

1. Introduction

Yau’s Theorem for compact K¨ahler manifolds [55] states that one can
prescribe the volume form of a K¨ahler metric within a given K¨ahler class.
This result, proved forty years ago, occupies a central place in the theory of
K¨ahler manifolds, with wide-ranging applications in geometry and mathe-
matical physics.

More precisely, Yau’s Theorem is as follows. Let (M 2n, ω, J) be a compact
K¨ahler manifold of complex dimension n, where ω denotes the K¨ahler form
and J the complex structure. Then given a smooth volume form eF ωn on
M there exists a unique smooth function ϕ satisfying

(ω + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ)n = eF ωn,
ω + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ > 0,

sup
M

ϕ = 0.

(1.1)

for K¨ahler manifolds.

as long as F satisﬁes the necessary normalization condition thatRM eF ωn =
RM ωn. The equation (1.1) is known as the complex Monge-Amp`ere equation

There has been great interest in extending Yau’s Theorem to non-K¨ahler
settings. Recall that a K¨ahler metric is a positive deﬁnite real (1, 1) form
ω, namely a Hermitian metric, which satisﬁes

dω = 0.

One extension of Yau’s Theorem, initiated by Cherrier [7] in the 1980s, is to
remove this closedness condition. This was carried out in full generality in
[45] where it was shown that (1.1) has a unique solution for ω Hermitian, up
to adding a (unique) constant to F (see also [44, 23], as well as [3, 8, 13, 28,
29, 31, 34, 39, 48, 56, 57] for later developments). A diﬀerent recent extension
on complex manifolds [40], conﬁrming a conjecture of Gauduchon [20], is
that one can prescribe the volume form of a Gauduchon metric (satisfying
∂ ¯∂(ωn−1) = 0).
In this case, (1.1) is replaced by a Monge-Amp`ere type
equation for (n − 1)-plurisubharmonic functions [25, 16, 17, 37, 49, 50].

Within this circle of ideas remain some open conjectures, such as a version
of Yau’s Theorem for balanced metrics (satisfying d(ωn−1) = 0) [16, 49,
50]. This is related to the some questions about the Strominger system of
mathematical physics, see e.g. [18, 30, 33] and the references therein.

A diﬀerent type of extension of Yau’s Theorem is to the case when J is a
non-integrable almost complex structure, and this is subject of the current
paper. Around twenty years ago, Gromov posed the following problem to P.
Delan¨oe [11]: let (M 2n, ω) be a compact symplectic manifold, J an almost
complex structure compatible with ω and F a smooth function on M with

RM eF ωn = RM ωn. Can one ﬁnd a smooth function ϕ on M such that

ω + d(Jdϕ) is a symplectic form taming J and satisfying

(1.2)

(ω + d(Jdϕ))n = eF ωn?

However, Delan¨oe [11] showed that when n = 2 the answer to this question
is negative, and this was later extended to all dimensions by Wang-Zhu [52].
The key ingredient of their results is the construction of a smooth function
ϕ0 such that ω + d(Jdϕ0) is on the boundary of the set of taming symplectic
forms (so its (1, 1) part is semipositive deﬁnite but not strictly positive), and
yet (ω+d(Jdϕ0))n > 0. This is possible because in this case the (2, 0)+(0, 2)
part of d(Jdϕ0) contributes a strictly positive amount.

This indicates that the problem with Gromov’s suggestion is that the 2-
form d(Jdϕ) is in general not of type (1, 1) with respect to J, due to the fact
that J may not be integrable (in fact, d(Jdf ) is of type (1, 1) for all functions
f if and only if J is integrable). Its (1, 1) part (up to an unimportant factor
of 2) will be denoted by

√−1∂∂ϕ =

1
2

(d(Jdϕ))(1,1),

which agrees with the standard notation when J is integrable (see also sec-
tion 2 for more explanations).

We show that an analogue of Gromov’s problem does hold after replacing

d(Jdϕ) with √−1∂∂ϕ. In fact we do not even require the manifold to be

symplectic. We obtain the following result for almost complex manifolds
equipped with an almost Hermitian metric ω.

Our main theorem is the following:

Theorem 1.1. Let (M, ω, J) be a compact almost Hermitian manifold of
real dimension 2n. Given a smooth function F there exists a unique pair
(ϕ, b) where ϕ ∈ C∞(M ) and b ∈ R, solving
(ω + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ)n = eF +bωn,
ω + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ > 0,

ϕ = 0.

(1.3)

sup
M

Namely, this says that the main result of [45] holds even when J is a
non-integrable almost complex structure. The equation (1.3) was ﬁrst con-
sidered by Harvey-Lawson [26] and Pli´s [35] in the setting of the Dirich-
let problem for J-pseudoconvex domains (see Remark 5 below). We note

THE MONGE-AMP`ERE EQUATION

3

here that there has been a renewed interest recently in the theory of J-
plurisubharmonic functions on almost complex manifolds, i.e.
functions ϕ

for which √−1∂∂ϕ > 0 (see e.g. [10, 24, 26, 27, 32, 35, 36]), and our main

theorem ﬁts well into this picture.

The key ingredients for proving Theorem 1.1 are the following new a priori

estimates:

Theorem 1.2. Let (M, ω, J) be a compact almost Hermitian manifold of
real dimension 2n. Given smooth functions F and ϕ satisfying

(1.4)

(ω + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ)n = eF ωn,
ω + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ > 0,

sup
M

ϕ = 0,

then there are uniform C∞ a priori estimates on ϕ depending only on (M, ω, J)
and bounds for F .

We make now a few remarks about our results:

1. We can also interpret the Monge-Amp`ere equation (1.3) in terms of Ricci
curvature forms. More precisely, we can associate to an almost Hermitian
[51]), whose curvature form can
metric ω a canonical connection (see e.g.
be expressed as a skew-Hermitian matrix of 2-forms {Ωi
j} (1 6 i, j 6 n) in
any local unitary frame, and deﬁning

Ric(ω) := √−1

Ωi
i,

n

Xi=1

we obtain a globally deﬁned closed real 2-form, which is cohomologous to
the ﬁrst Chern class 2πc1(M, J) in H 2(M, R).
If ϕ is a smooth function

with ˜ω := ω +√−1∂∂ϕ > 0 then (1.3) holds for some constant b if and only

if

(1.5)

Ric(˜ω) = Ric(ω) −

1
2

d(JdF ),

as follows easily from [51, (3.16)]. Note however that in general there are
representatives of the ﬁrst Chern class 2πc1(M, J) in H 2(M, R) which cannot
be written in the form Ric(ω) − 1
2 d(JdF ) for any ω and F , even when J is
integrable (cf. [44, Corollary 2]).

2. Suppose now that (M 2n, ω, J) is a compact symplectic manifold with J
an almost complex structure tamed by ω. In this case ω(1,1) is an almost
Hermitian metric. Given a smooth function F we obtain a pair (ϕ, b) solving

(1.6)

(ω(1,1) + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ)n = eF +bωn,
ω(1,1) + √−1∂ ¯∂ϕ > 0,

sup
M

ϕ = 0.

J. CHU, V. TOSATTI, AND B. WEINKOVE

If we deﬁne ˜ω = ω + 1
5]) shows that ˜ω is a symplectic form taming J and

2 d(Jdϕ), then a simple calculation (cf. [11, Proposition
˜ωn > (ω(1,1) + √−1∂∂ϕ)n = eF +bωn.

(1.7)

3. A diﬀerent extension of Yau’s Theorem to the symplectic setting was pro-
posed by Donaldson [14]. He considered a symplectic 4-manifold (M, ω, J)
with J a tamed almost complex structure, and conjectured that, given a
smooth function F , and given a symplectic form ˜ω cohomologous to ω, com-
patible with J and solving

˜ω2 = eF ω2,

then ˜ω should have uniform C∞ a priori estimates. Donaldson showed
that this conjecture and various extensions of it would have consequences
for symplectic topology. This problem is fundamentally diﬀerent from our
setup, since here the diﬀerence ˜ω − ω is not given by a simple operator
applied to a function ϕ. Donaldson’s conjecture remains open in general,
but it is known to hold in some special cases [54, 51, 46, 47, 15, 5].

4. One can also consider the parabolic Monge-Amp`ere equation

∂ϕt
∂t

= log

(ω + √−1∂∂ϕt)n

ωn

− F, ϕ0 = 0,

where we require that ω + √−1∂∂ϕt > 0. Analogously to the result proved

by Cao [6] in the K¨ahler case and Gill [22] in the Hermitian case, we expect
that the techniques developed in this paper can be used to show that a
smooth solution ϕt exists for all t > 0, and after suitable normalization
converges smoothly to the solution of (1.3).

Similarly, we can consider the equation

∂ϕt
∂t

= log

(ω − tRic(ω)(1,1) + √−1∂∂ϕt)n

ωn

, ϕ0 = 0,

where now we require that ω − tRic(ω)(1,1) + √−1∂∂ϕt > 0. This is in fact

equivalent to the evolution equation for almost Hermitian forms

∂ωt
∂t

= −Ric(ωt)(1,1), ω0 = ω,

which is the K¨ahler-Ricci ﬂow if J is integrable and ω0 is K¨ahler, and the
Chern-Ricci ﬂow [22, 48] if J is integrable. Again, using the techniques
developed in this paper one should be able to characterize the maximal
existence time of this ﬂow, exactly as in [41, 48].

5. We now discuss the proof of our main results, and relate this to the work of
Pli´s [35] who, as noted above, investigated this problem on J-pseudoconvex
domains (Harvey-Lawson [26] obtained weak solutions in the viscosity sense,
and in a more general setting). We prove the a priori estimates of Theorem
1.2 in four steps: the zero order estimate for ϕ, the ﬁrst order estimate, the
real Hessian bound and then higher order estimates.

THE MONGE-AMP`ERE EQUATION

5

For the zero order estimate we adapt an approach of Sz´ekelyhidi [39],
which in turn uses ideas of B locki [2, 3]. The idea is to work locally near
the inﬁmum of ϕ and use a modiﬁcation of the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci
maximum principle. Sz´ekelyhidi’s argument holds for a large class of equa-
tions, but assuming an integrable complex structure. We show that the extra
terms arising from the non-integrability can be controlled. This argument
is contained in Section 3.

The next step is to bound the ﬁrst derivatives of ϕ, and we carry this out
in Section 4. We use a maximum principle argument, adapted from Pli´s [35].
In particular we compute using a unitary frame e1, . . . , en, which turns out
to be quite convenient for this problem. The diﬀerence with [35] is that, as
would be expected in the compact case, we need to replace Pli´s’s auxiliary
global plurisubharmonic function with a certain choice of “barrier function”
involving ϕ itself.

The heart of the paper is Section 5, where we prove a bound on the real
Hessian of ϕ. Here, the argument diverges substantially from the study
of other similar nonlinear PDEs on complex manifolds where the approach
is to bound ﬁrst the complex Hessian of ϕ (see e.g.
[4, 23] for instances
where a real Hessian bound is obtained for the complex Monge-Amp`ere
equation, with J integrable, after having ﬁrst obtained a complex Hessian
bound). There are diﬃculties in carrying out the analogous computation for
the complex Hessian here, because of some linear third order terms which,
roughly speaking, involve three “barred” or “unbarred” partial derivatives
of ϕ and cannot be controlled by the usual squares of third order terms.
Instead, we use an important idea of Pli´s [35], which is to directly bound
the real Hessian of ϕ. Since we had some diﬃculties understanding all the
calculations of [35] (in particular, how to obtain the ﬁrst displayed equation
of page 981 from the previous lines) we take a diﬀerent approach, which turns
out to be substantially more intricate. We apply the maximum principle
to a quantity involving the largest eigenvalue λ1 (cf.
[53, 39, 40]) of the
real Hessian of ϕ. This gives us some good third order terms which are
suﬃcient, after a series of rather technical lemmas, to push the argument
through. One source of complication is the need to rule out the case when
the largest eigenvector of the real Hessian of ϕ is in a direction where the
complex Hessian is very small (see Lemma 5.6 below).

Once we have the real Hessian of ϕ bounded, it is then straightforward
to obtain the higher order estimates by applying directly an Evans-Krylov
type result from [43] and then some standard bootstrapping arguments. In
Section 6 we describe how to obtain the main result Theorem 1.1 using a
continuity argument similar to that of [44].

Before we start with the proofs of the main results, we describe ﬁrst some

basic results, and notation, on almost complex manifolds.

2. Basic results and notation

Let M 2n be a compact manifold of real dimension 2n (without boundary)
equipped with an almost complex structure J, namely an endomorphism of
the tangent bundle satisfying J 2 = −Id. The complexiﬁed tangent space
T CM can be decomposed as a direct sum of the two eigenspaces T (1,0)M
and T (0,1)M of J, corresponding to eigenvalues √−1 and −√−1 respectively.
Similarly, extending J to 1-forms α by (Jα)(X) = −α(JX), we obtain a
decomposition of T CM∗ into the √−1 and −√−1 eigenspaces, spanned by
the (0, 1) and (1, 0) forms respectively. Thus, with the obvious deﬁnitions,
any complex diﬀerential form of degree k can be expressed uniquely as a
linear combination of (p, q) forms with p + q = k.

An almost Hermitian metric g on (M 2n, J) is a Riemannian metric satis-

fying

g(JX, JY ) = g(X, Y ),

for all X, Y ∈ T M.

Such metrics always exist in abundance on almost complex manifolds. The
metric g deﬁnes a positive deﬁnite real (1, 1) form ω, given by

Conversely, such an ω deﬁnes an almost Hermitian metric g by

ω(X, Y ) = g(JX, Y ).

g(X, Y ) = ω(X, JY ).

As we have already done in the introduction, we abuse terminology by re-
ferring to the positive deﬁnite (1, 1) form ω as an almost Hermitian metric.

The exterior derivative acting on (p, q) forms splits as

d = ∂ + ∂ + T + T ,

where T changes the bidegree by (2,−1) and T by (−1, 2) (these are essen-
tially given by the Nijenhuis tensor) and so we can deﬁne

It is immediate to see that this is indeed a real (1, 1) form. A simple calcu-
lation shows that

√−1∂∂ϕ := √−1∂(∂ϕ).

√−1∂∂ϕ =

1
2

(d(Jdϕ))(1,1).

THE MONGE-AMP`ERE EQUATION

7

We also have (see e.g. [26, (2.5)]) that for any two (1, 0) vector ﬁelds V, W,

(2.1)

(∂∂ϕ)(V, W ) = V W (ϕ) − [V, W ](0,1)(ϕ).

We extend the action of J to p-forms by

(Jα)(X1, . . . , Xp) := (−1)pα(JX1, . . . , JXp),

which satisﬁes J 2 = (−1)p. If ∗ is the Hodge star operator of the Riemannian
metric g deﬁned by ω then the actions of ∗ and J on p-forms commute (see
e.g. [21, Lemma 1.10.1]). We will say that ω is Gauduchon if

(2.2)
where d∗ is the adjoint of d with respect to g. A short calculation shows
that (2.2) is equivalent to

d∗(Jd∗ω) = 0,

(2.3)

d(Jd(ωn−1)) = 0,

so we see that when J is integrable this condition reduces to the well-known
one.

Theorem 2.1 (Gauduchon [19]). Let (M 2n, ω, J), n > 2, be a compact al-
most Hermitian manifold. Then there exists a smooth function u, unique up
to addition of a constant, such that the conformal almost Hermitian metric
euω is Gauduchon.

For convenience, we will give a brief sketch of the proof of this result in

the proof of Theorem 2.2.

Let now (M 2n, ω, J) be almost Hermitian, and f a smooth function on

M . We deﬁne the canonical Laplacian of f by

(2.4)

∆Cf =

nωn−1 ∧ √−1∂∂f

ωn

=

nωn−1 ∧ d(Jdf )

2ωn

.

If ∆ denotes the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator of g then we have the
relation

(2.5)

∆f = 2∆Cf + τ (df ),

where τ is the “torsion vector ﬁeld” of (ω, J) (the dual of its Lee form), see
e.g. [42, Lemma 3.2].

For the “openness” part of the continuity method, we will need the fol-

lowing result:

Theorem 2.2 (Gauduchon [19]). Let (M 2n, ω, J), n > 2, be a compact al-
most Hermitian manifold. Fix a nonnegative integer k, and 0 < α < 1.
Given a function h ∈ C k,α(M ), there exists a function f ∈ C k+2,α(M ) solv-
ing

(2.6)

if and only if

(2.7)

∆Cf = h,

ZM

8

J. CHU, V. TOSATTI, AND B. WEINKOVE

where u is as in Theorem 2.1. In this case the solution f is unique up to
addition of a constant.

Proof. Although this result is not explicitly stated there, the proof is con-
tained in [19]. For the convenience of the reader we give a brief sketch,
referring to [19] for details. Let ∆∗ be the formal L2 adjoint of ∆C, which
is given by

∆∗f = −

1
2

d∗(Jd∗(f ω)),

where f ∈ C∞(X, R). This is an elliptic second order real diﬀerential op-
erator, whose index, like the index of ∆C, is zero. Since the kernel of ∆C
consists just of constants, it follows that dimR ker ∆∗ = 1. The strong max-
imum principle implies that the only smooth real function in the image of
∆C which has constant sign is the zero function, and this implies that every
function in the kernel of ∆∗ has constant sign. Thus we can choose a smooth
function f 6≡ 0 with ∆∗f = 0 and f > 0, and then another application of the
strong maximum principle shows that in fact f > 0. Therefore we can write
f = e(n−1)u, for some u ∈ C∞(X, R), and the fact that ∆∗f = 0 exactly
says that euω is Gauduchon.
The theorem now follows from the Fredholm alternative, since (2.7) means
that h is orthogonal to ker ∆∗, which is then equivalent to h being in the
image of ∆C.
(cid:3)

For later use, we have the following result.

Proposition 2.3. Let (M 2n, ω, J) be a compact almost Hermitian manifold,
with ω its associated real (1, 1) form. Then there is a constant C > 0
depending only on (M, ω, J) such that every smooth function ϕ on M which
satisﬁes

(2.8)

also satisﬁes

Proof. Applying Theorem 2.1 we obtain a smooth function u such that the
almost Hermitian metric ω′ = euω is Gauduchon. Let ∆′C be the canonical
Laplacian of ω′, which is an elliptic second order diﬀerential operator with
the kernel consisting of just constants. Standard linear PDE theory (see e.g.
[1, Appendix A]) shows that there exists a Green function G for ∆′C which
satisﬁes G(x, y) > −C,kG(x,·)kL1 (M,g) 6 C, for a constant C > 0, and

since ω′ is Gauduchon. For the “integration by parts” step above, we have
used the elementary pointwise equality

α ∧ (Jβ) = (−1)p(Jα) ∧ β,
which holds for any (2n − p)-form α and p-form β.
Therefore, we are free to add a large uniform constant to G(x, y) to make
it nonnegative, while preserving the same Green formula. If ϕ satisﬁes (2.8)
then we have

∆′Cϕ = e−u∆Cϕ > −ne−u,

(cid:3)

We end this section with a remark about the use of the maximum princi-

and so we immediately deduce that RM (−ϕ)ω′n 6 C, from which (2.9) fol-
ple. Consider a function f ∈ C 2(M ). Then
(2.11)

√−1∂∂f (x0) 6 0 if f has a local maximum at x0,

and the reverse inequality holds at a local minimum. Indeed, the only dif-
ference from the integrable case is a ﬁrst order term which vanishes at x0.

3. Zero order estimate

Here we follow the argument given in [39, Proposition 10] when J is
integrable, which is a modiﬁcation and improvement of an earlier argument
by B locki [2, 3].

Proposition 3.1. Let ϕ solve the Monge-Amp`ere equation (1.4). Then
there exists a constant C, depending only on (M, ω, J) and bounds for F
such that

|ϕ| 6 C.

Proof. Since supM ϕ = 0, it suﬃces to derive a uniform lower bound for
I := inf M ϕ. Let p ∈ M be a point where this inﬁmum is achieved, and
choose local coordinates {x1, . . . , x2n} centered at p deﬁned on an open set
containing the unit ball B ⊂ R2n in its interior. On B let

v(x) = ϕ(x) + ε

where ε > 0 will be chosen later. Then

We deﬁne a set P by
P = {x ∈ B | |Dv(x)| < ε/2, and v(y) > v(x) + Dv(x) · (y − x), ∀y ∈ B}.

10

J. CHU, V. TOSATTI, AND B. WEINKOVE

Note that 0 ∈ P , and that D2v(x) > 0 as well as |Dϕ(x)| 6 5
2 ε for all
x ∈ P . Now at any x ∈ B the symmetric bilinear form H(v)(X, Y ) :=
(√−1∂∂v)(X, JY ) is equal to

(3.2)

H(v) =

(D2v)J + E(v),

1
2

where (D2v)J is the J-invariant part of D2v(x),

(D2v)J (x) :=

1
2

(D2v + J T · D2v · J)(x),

and E(v) is an error matrix which depends linearly on Dv(x) (see e.g. [43,
p.443]). Therefore, using the fact that det(A + B) > det A + det B for
symmetric nonnegative deﬁnite matrices A, B, we have for all x ∈ P ,
(3.3) det(D2v)(x) 6 22n−1 det((D2v)J )(x) = 24n−1 det(H(v) − E(v))(x).
(or, one can argue as in [2]). Moreover,

(D2ϕ)J (x) > (D2v)J (x) − Cε Id > −Cε Id,

and using that |Dϕ(x)| 6 5ε/2, together with (3.2), we obtain

H(ϕ)(x) > −Cε Id,

for a uniform constant C. Therefore at any x ∈ P we have

ω + √−1∂∂ϕ >

1
2

ω,

provided ε is suﬃciently small (this ﬁxes the value of ε), but the Monge-
Amp`ere equation (1.4) then gives us

ω + √−1∂∂ϕ 6 Cω.

From this, using again (3.1) and |Dv(x)| < ε/2, we conclude that for all
x ∈ P we have

0 6 (H(v) − E(v))(x) 6 C Id,

and (3.3) gives

det(D2v)(x) 6 C.

Applying the modiﬁed Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci maximum principle in
[39, Proposition 11] we obtain

ε2n 6 C2nZP

det(D2v),

for a constant C2n which depends only on the dimension of M , and so

ε2n 6 C|P|,

where |P| denotes the Lebesgue measure of P . But for any x ∈ P we also

case by the method of Moser iteration [55], much like in [45] (where J is
integrable), but the calculations are longer. The Moser iteration method was
also used by Delan¨oe [12] for the equation suggested by Gromov (as discussed
in the introduction), but in that case the argument is more similar to that
of the K¨ahler case.

4. First order estimate

In this section, we prove a ﬁrst order a priori estimate for ϕ, which uses
the zero order estimate of Section 3. This part of the argument is similar
to [35, Lemma 3.3], except that here we replace Pli´s’s auxiliary plurisubhar-
monic function by a barrier function involving the solution ϕ.

Proposition 4.1. Let ϕ solve the Monge-Amp`ere equation (1.4). Then
there exists a constant C, depending only on (M, g, J) and bounds for F
such that

|∂ϕ|g 6 C.

Proof. We will prove this estimate by applying the maximum principle to
the quantity Q = ef (ϕ)|∂ϕ|2
g, for a function f = f (ϕ) to be determined later.
We will show that at the maximum point of Q, |∂ϕ|g is uniformly bounded
from above.
First we discuss coordinates. Let {e1, . . . , en} be a local frame for T (1,0)M
and let {θ1, . . . , θn} be a dual coframe. We write gij = g(ei, ej). The (1, 1)
form ω is given by

ω = √−1gijθi ∧ θ

j

,

˜ω = ω + √−1∂∂ϕ,

where here and henceforth, as should be clear from the context, we are
summing over repeated indices (on occasion, for clarity, we will include the
summation). We deﬁne

and write ˜gij for the associated metric, deﬁned by ˜ω = √−1˜gijθi ∧ θ

j

.

Equation (2.1) immediately implies that

and hence

(4.1)

√−1∂ ¯∂ϕ = √−1(eiej(ϕ) − [ei, ej](0,1)(ϕ))θi ∧ θ

j

,

˜gij = gij + eiej(ϕ) − [ei, ej](0,1)(ϕ).

12

We now assume for the rest of this section that our local frame {e1, . . . , en}
is unitary with respect to g, so that gij = δij. Therefore in these coordinates,
|∂ϕ|2
Fix a point x0 at which Q achieves its maximum on M . Then, after
making a unitary transformation, we may and do assume that ˜gij is diagonal
at x0.

+ ϕkeieiek(ϕ) − ϕk[ei, ei](0,1)ek(ϕ)(cid:9).

To deal with the terms involving three derivatives of ϕ, we use the equation
(1.4), which we can rewrite in our coordinates as

log det(˜gij ) = F.

Applying ek, we obtain ˜gijek(˜gij) = Fk, which at the point x0 gives us

(4.5)

˜gii(ekeiei(ϕ) − ek[ei, ei](0,1)(ϕ)) = Fk
˜gii(ekeiei(ϕ) − ek[ei, ei](0,1)(ϕ)) = Fk.

5. Second order estimate

In this section we prove:

Proposition 5.1. Let ϕ solve the Monge-Amp`ere equation (1.4). Then
there exists a constant C, depending only on (M, g, J) and bounds for F
such that

where ∇2ϕ denotes the real Hessian of ϕ with respect to the metric g (using
its Levi-Civita connection).

|∇2ϕ|g 6 C,

16

J. CHU, V. TOSATTI, AND B. WEINKOVE

Proof. We ﬁrst make the preliminary observation that

|∇2ϕ|g 6 Cλ1(∇2ϕ) + C′,

(5.1)
everywhere on M , where λ1(∇2ϕ) is the largest eigenvalue of the real Hes-
sian ∇2ϕ (with respect to the metric g).
Indeed, if we write λ1(∇2ϕ) >
λ2(∇2ϕ) > . . . > λ2n(∇2ϕ) for all the eigenvalues, then

|∇2ϕ|g =  2n

2n

(5.2)

λα = ∆ϕ = 2∆Cϕ + τ (dϕ) > −2n + τ (dϕ) > −C,

Xα=1

using Proposition 4.1. This inequality implies that λ1 > −C, and so

and it also implies that

|λ1| 6 λ1 + C,

and (5.1) follows. Therefore it suﬃces to bound λ1(∇2ϕ) from above. To
achieve this we apply the maximum principle to the quantity

|λ2n| 6 Cλ1 + C,

Q = log λ1(∇2ϕ) + h(|∂ϕ|2

g) + e−Aϕ,

on the set {x ∈ M | λ1(∇2ϕ(x)) > 0}, which we may assume is nonempty,
without loss of generality. Here h is given by

(5.3)

h(s) = −

1
2

log(1 + sup

M |∂ϕ|2

g − s),

and A > 1 is a constant to be determined (which will be uniform, in the sense
that it will depend only on the background data). Observe that h(|∂ϕ|2
g) is
uniformly bounded, and we have

(5.4)

1
2

> h′ >

1

2 + 2 supM |∂ϕ|2

g

> 0,

and h′′ = 2(h′)2,

where we evaluate h and its derivatives at |∂ϕ|2
g.
Note that Q is a continuous function on its domain, and goes to −∞ on
its boundary (if this is nonempty), and hence achieves a maximum at a point
x0 ∈ M with λ1(∇2ϕ(x0)) > 0. However, Q is not smooth in general, since
the eigenspace associated to λ1 may have dimension strictly larger than 1.
We deal with this using a perturbation argument, as in [39, 40].

First we discuss the choice of coordinate system in a neighborhood of
x0. Let V1 be a unit vector (with respect to g) corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue λ1 of ∇2ϕ, so that at x0,

∇2ϕ(V1, V1) = λ1.

THE MONGE-AMP`ERE EQUATION

17

Since g is almost Hermitian, it follows easily that we can ﬁnd a coordinate
system x1, x2, . . . , x2n centered at x0, such that in the frame ∂1, . . . , ∂2n the
almost complex structure J is standard at x0 (i.e. J∂1 = ∂2, etc.) and the
vectors ∂1, . . . , ∂2n are g-orthonormal at x0. Furthermore, after making a
quadratic change of coordinates, we assume that the ﬁrst derivatives of g
vanish at x0:

(5.5)

∂γgαβ|x0 = 0,

for all α, β, γ = 1, . . . , 2n.

If at x0 we let
(5.6)

e1 =

1
√2

(∂1−√−1∂2), e2 =

1
√2

(∂3−√−1∂4), . . . , en =

1
√2

(∂2n−1−√−1∂2n),

then these form a frame of (1, 0) vectors at x0, and we have that gij :=
g(ei, ej) = δij (i.e. the frame is g-unitary). By performing a further linear
change of coordinates at x0, which commutes with J, we may assume that
at x0 we have gij = δij and (˜gij) is diagonal with
˜g11 > ˜g22 > ··· > ˜gnn.

This does not aﬀect condition (5.5), or the fact that J is standard at x0, and
since g is almost Hermitian we see that the (new) real vectors ∂1, . . . , ∂2n
are still g-orthonormal at x0.

We extend e1, . . . , en smoothly to a g-unitary frame of (1, 0) vectors in a
neighborhood of x0. The coordinate system and the local unitary frame are
now ﬁxed. Extend V1 to an orthonormal basis V1, . . . , V2n of eigenvectors
of ∇2ϕ (with respect to g) at x0, corresponding to eigenvalues λ1(∇2ϕ) >
λ2(∇2ϕ) > . . . > λ2n(∇2ϕ). Write {V α
α=1 for the components of the
vector Vβ at x0, with respect to the coordinates x1, . . . , x2n described above.
We extend V1, V2, . . . , V2n to be vector ﬁelds in a neighborhood of x0 by
taking the components to be constant. Note that we do not assert that the
Vi are eigenvectors for ∇2ϕ outside x0.
We apply a perturbation argument. We deﬁne near x0 a smooth section
B = (Bαβ) of T ∗M ⊗T ∗M by setting its value in our coordinates x1, . . . , x2n
at x0 to be

and extending it to be constant in these coordinates nearby x0. At x0,

and B(Y, Y ) = 1 for any unit vector Y g-orthogonal to V1.

It is convenient to work with endomorphisms of T M instead of symmetric

sections of T ∗M ⊗ T ∗M . We deﬁne a local endomorphism Φ = (Φα
by

(5.7)

β = gαγ∇2

18

J. CHU, V. TOSATTI, AND B. WEINKOVE

Now instead of λ1(∇2ϕ), we consider λ1(Φ), the largest eigenvalue of the
endomorphism Φ.
Note that Bαβ is nonnegative deﬁnite and hence λ1(Φ) 6 λ1(∇2ϕ) in a
neighborhood of x0 while, by deﬁnition of B and V1, λ1(Φ) = λ1(∇2ϕ) at x0.
Moreover, at x0, the eigenspace of Φ corresponding to the largest eigenvalue
now has dimension 1, and hence λ1 = λ1(Φ) is smooth in a neighborhood of
x0.

We can now consider the perturbed quantity ˆQ deﬁned in a neighborhood

of x0 by

ˆQ = log λ1(Φ) + h(|∂ϕ|2

g) + e−Aϕ,

which still obtains a local maximum at x0. V1, . . . , V2n are eigenvectors for
Φ at x0, corresponding to eigenvalues λ1(Φ) > λ2(Φ) > . . . > λ2n(Φ). In
what follows we write λα for λα(Φ).

The ﬁrst and second derivatives of λ1 at x0 are given by the following

lemma.

˜gii.

Given this, the lemma follows, since in our coordinates, our equation (1.4)
is

Hence, recalling that gij = g(ei, ej) = δij near x0,

log det ˜g = log det g + F.

˜gijV1(˜gij) = V1(F ),

and applying V1 again,

(5.13)

˜giiV1V1(˜gii) = ˜gpp˜gqq|V1(˜gpq)|2 + V1V1(F ),

and then (5.10) follows from (5.11), (5.12) and (5.9).

We now give the proof of (5.12). We have

(5.14)

˜giieiei(ϕV1V1) = ˜giieieiV1V1(ϕ) − ˜giieiei(∇V1V1)(ϕ),

since, for any α, β,

ϕVαVβ = VαVβ(ϕ) − (∇VαVβ)(ϕ).

First we deal with the second term of (5.14). We claim that

For simplicity of notation let W = ∇V1V1. Then at x0 we have, using

= W (˜gii) + W [ei, ei](0,1)(ϕ) + [ei, W ]ei(ϕ) + ei[ei, W ](ϕ).

Applying W to (1.4) we have

and (5.15) now follows from (5.1) and (5.9).

˜giiW (˜gii) = W (F ),

Next we note that
−˜gii[ei, ei](0,1)(ϕV1V1) = −˜gii[ei, ei](0,1)V1V1(ϕ) + ˜gii[ei, ei](0,1)(∇V1V1)(ϕ)

in (5.17). We split up into diﬀerent cases. The constant ε > 0 will be
diﬀerent in each case.

Case 1. Assume that, at x0,
(a) ˜g11 < A3e−2Aϕ˜gnn, or

˜gii(|eiek(ϕ)|2 + |eiek(ϕ)|2) + (Ae−Aϕ − C)Xi

˜gii − Ane−Aϕ.
But from (5.4), we have h′′ = 2(h′)2. In case (a) note that from the equation
(1.4) we have a uniform upper bound for ˜gii (for each i) and a uniform lower
bound away from zero. Then we have

for a uniform constant CA (depending on the uniform constant A), and so

(5.21)

Xi,k
(|eiek(ϕ)|2 + |eiek(ϕ)|2) 6 CA.

But at x0 we can deﬁne the complex covariant derivatives ϕeiek and ϕeiek in
the obvious way, which satisfy

ϕeiek − eiek(ϕ) = −(∇eiek)(ϕ), ϕeiek − eiek(ϕ) = −(∇eiek)(ϕ),

24

J. CHU, V. TOSATTI, AND B. WEINKOVE

and these diﬀerences are uniformly bounded thanks to Proposition 4.1.
Therefore

(5.22)

(|ϕeiek|2 + |ϕeiek|2) 6 CA,

Xi,k

and recalling (5.6), we see that

(5.23)

|∇2

αβϕ| 6 CA,

Xα,β

and so λ1(x0) is uniformly bounded. Thanks to Propositions 3.1 and 4.1,
this shows that Q is bounded from above at x0, and hence everywhere.

On the other hand, in case (b), we obtain

0 >

h′

4 Xk

˜gii(|eiek(ϕ)|2 + |eiek(ϕ)|2) + (A − C0)Xi

˜gii − Ane−Aϕ,

for a uniform C0. Then as long as

(5.24)

A > C0 + 1,

we again see that Q is bounded from above at x0. This completes Case 1.

Case 2. Neither (a) nor (b) of Case 1 hold.

This is the diﬃcult case, and it will take up the rest of this section. Let

I = {i ∈ {1, . . . , n} | ˜gii(x0) > A3e−2Aϕ(x0)˜gnn(x0)}.

We have n 6∈ I (since A > 1), and 1 ∈ I (otherwise we are in part (a) of
Case 1). So for example when n = 2 we have I = {1}.
We will use four lemmas to complete the proof. The ﬁrst deals with the
relatively harmless part of the bad term (5.19).

Lemma 5.5. Assuming that A is larger than 6n supM |∂ϕ|2

The next lemma shows that, roughly speaking, and modulo terms of order
O(λ−1
1 ), the largest eigenvector V1 lies in the directions where the Hermitian
metric (˜gii) at x0 is not too small. More precisely, we deﬁne in our coordinate
patch a (1, 0) vector ﬁeld by

We write at x0,

The goal for our last two lemmas is to obtain a lower bound for the ﬁrst
three terms on the right hand side of (5.17), excluding those bounded by
Lemma 5.5. The ﬁrst of these two lemmas is a technical intermediate step.

assuming without loss of generality that at x0, λ1 > CA/ε for a uniform
CA > 0 depending on A. Here we are writing ˜g˜1˜1
Proof. We ﬁrst claim that

:= ˜g(˜e1, ˜e1).

(5.31)

ei(ϕV1V1) = √2Xq

νqV1(˜giq) − √−1Xα>1

µαei(ϕV1Vα) + E,

where E denotes a term satisfying |E| 6 Cλ1 for a uniform C. Deﬁning
ϕV1 ˜e1 in the obvious way, we have at x0,

(5.32)
since ˜e1 = 1√2
(5.33)

ei(ϕV1V1) = √2ei(ϕV1 ˜e1) − √−1ei(ϕV1JV1),
(V1 + √−1JV1). Next,
ei(ϕV1 ˜e1) = eiV1˜e1(ϕ) − ei(∇V1 ˜e1)(ϕ) = ˜e1eiV1(ϕ) + E,

since the error terms arising from switching the order of operators give terms
involving only two derivatives of ϕ.

With ν1, . . . , νn ∈ C as in (5.27), we have at x0,

νqV1eieq(ϕ) + E

˜e1eiV1(ϕ) = Xq

νq eqeiV1(ϕ) =Xq

νqV1(˜giq) + E.

(5.34)

Recalling (5.30),

ei(ϕV1JV1) = eiV1JV1(ϕ) − ei(∇V1(JV1))(ϕ) = JV1eiV1(ϕ) + E

= Xα>1

µαVαeiV1(ϕ) + E = Xα>1

µαei(ϕV1Vα) + E.

Combining (5.32), (5.33), (5.34) and (5.35) proves the claim (5.31).

6. Completion of the proofs of the Main Theorems

In this section, we complete the proofs of the main results stated in the

introduction.

Proof of Theorem 1.2. Thanks to Propositions 3.1 and 5.1, we can obtain
a priori C 2,α estimates from the main result of [43], for some 0 < α < 1
(and in fact for all 0 < α < 1 by [9]). Higher order estimates follow after
diﬀerentiating the equation and applying the usual bootstrapping method.
(cid:3)

Our main result now follows easily:

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Now we have Theorem 1.2, we can follow closely the
Indeed, we will see that the (1, 1) form √−1∂∂ϕ =
arguments of [44].
1
2 (d(Jdϕ))(1,1) has the right properties for this part of the proof to go through
essentially unchanged from the integrable case. We include the brief argu-
ments for the sake of completeness. Consider the family of equations

(ω + √−1∂∂ϕt)n = etF +btωn, ω + √−1∂∂ϕt > 0,

(6.1)
for t ∈ [0, 1], where bt ∈ R. For a ﬁxed α ∈ (0, 1), we deﬁne T to be the set
of t ∈ [0, 1] such that (6.1) admits a solution (ϕt, bt) ∈ C 3,α(M )× R. Clearly
0 ∈ T . We will show that T is open and closed, since this will show that
1 ∈ T , and then adding a constant to ϕ1 we will obtain a solution of (1.3).
To prove that T is open, ﬁx ˆt ∈ T , and write ˆω := ω + √−1∂∂ϕˆt. From
Theorem 2.1, there exists a smooth ˆu such that eˆu ˆω is Gauduchon, and we
may assume that RM e(n−1)ˆu ˆωn = 1. Deﬁne a map Ψ by
which takes ψ ∈ C 3,α(M ) with RM ψe(n−1)ˆu ˆωn = 0 and ˆω + √−1∂∂ψ > 0
to a C 1,α(M ) function h satisfying RM ehe(n−1)ˆu ˆωn = 1. For t close to ˆt we

e(n−1)ˆu(ˆω + √−1∂∂ψ)n(cid:19) ,

(ˆω + √−1∂∂ψ)n

wish to solve

Ψ(ψ) = log

ˆωn

(6.2)

Ψ(ψt) = (t − ˆt )F − log(cid:18)ZM

e(t−ˆt )F e(n−1)ˆu ˆωn(cid:19) .

(6.3)

Observe that Ψ(0) = 0, and that the linearization of Ψ at ψ = 0 is given by
the canonical Laplacian (see (2.4)) of ˆω,
η 7→ ∆C
ˆω η,

since RM √−1∂∂η ∧ e(n−1)ˆu ˆωn−1 = 0 (which follows from integration by

parts, as in (2.10), and the fact that eˆu ˆω is Gauduchon). By Theorem 2.2,
the operator (6.3) is an invertible map of the tangent spaces, and so by the

34

J. CHU, V. TOSATTI, AND B. WEINKOVE

Inverse Function Theorem we obtain ψt solving (6.2) for t close to ˆt. Then
ϕt = ϕˆt + ψt solves (6.1) for t close to ˆt, for bt ∈ R, showing that T is open.
To prove that T is closed we will apply Theorem 1.2. Suppose ϕt ∈
C 3,α(M ) solves (6.1). Then, as above, we can diﬀerentiate the equation and
bootstrap to obtain that ϕt is smooth. Applying the maximum principle
(2.11) to ϕt in (6.1) we obtain the bound |bt| 6 supM |F|. We may add
a t-dependent constant to ϕt solving (6.1) so that supM ϕt = 0. Now we
apply Theorem 1.2 to ϕt to obtain C 3,α (in fact, C∞) estimates which are
independent of t. This shows that T is closed. Hence we have proved the
existence of a C 3,α, and hence smooth, solution of (1.3).
It remains to prove uniqueness. Assume that we have two solutions (ϕ, b)

and (ϕ′, b′) of (1.3). Writing θ = ϕ − ϕ′, we have
(ω + √−1∂∂ϕ′ + √−1∂∂θ)n

= eb−b′

.

(ω + √−1∂∂ϕ′)n

Applying (2.11) at the extrema of θ we obtain b = b′. Then

(ω + √−1∂∂ϕ)n = (ω + √−1∂∂ϕ′)n

and so

√−1∂∂θ ∧

n−1

Xi=0

(ω + √−1∂∂ϕ)i ∧ (ω + √−1∂∂ϕ′)n−1−i = 0.

The strong maximum principle (together with the fact that supM ϕ = supM ϕ′ =
0) implies that θ = 0, namely ϕ = ϕ′. This completes the proof.
