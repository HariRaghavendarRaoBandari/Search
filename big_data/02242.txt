(Dated: March 8, 2016)

We show that one can determine both parameters of a displacement acting on an oscillator with
an accuracy which scales inversely with the square root of the number of photons in the oscillator.
Our results are obtained by using a grid state as a sensor state for detecting small changes in
position and momentum (displacements). Grid states were ﬁrst proposed in [1] for encoding a qubit
into an oscillator: an eﬃcient preparation protocol of such states, using a coupling to a qubit, was
developed in [2]. We compare the performance of the grid state with the quantum compass or cat
code state and place our results in the context of the two-parameter quantum Cram´er-Rao lower
bound on the variances of the displacement parameters. We show that the accessible information
about the displacement for a grid state increases with the number of photons in the state when we
measure and prepare the state using the phase estimation protocol in [2]. This is in contrast with
the accessible information in the quantum compass state which we show is always upper bounded
by a constant, independent of the number of photons.

It is a fact of quantum mechanics that one cannot si-
multaneously measure the position q and momentum p of
a quantum state as the position and momentum operator
do not commute [ˆq, ˆp] = i. This however does not im-
ply that every function of these operators cannot be mea-
sured simultaneously as some functions of these operators
may commute. We assume a harmonic oscillator with
mω ) with mass m,
angular frequency ω and Hamiltonian H = ω(a†a + 1
2 ).
This harmonic oscillator could physically represent an
optical or microwave cavity mode, an LC oscillator or a
nanomechanical oscillator for example.

One can deﬁne two commuting operators Sp =

. Sp acts as a shift
mω (cid:105) while Sq acts as
√
a shift in momentum, Sq |p(cid:105) = |p +
2πmω(cid:105) where |q(cid:105)
and |p(cid:105) are position and momentum eigenstates. One
can verify the commutation of these operators by using
the identity eAeB = eBeAe[A,B] for A, B linear com-
binations of ˆp and ˆq. The fact that there exist states
which are simultaneous eigenstates of Sp and Sq opens
the way for simultaneously detecting changes in position
and momentum due to a force.
In other words, such
states could be of interest as displacement sensors and
displacement sensing can be useful for detecting and mea-
suring a weak time-dependent classical force on the os-
cillator [3]. Assume that one has prepared a sensor state
in the harmonic oscillator at some initial time t = 0.
For an interval in time from t = 0 to τ a weak time-
dependent classical force acts so that during this interval

and phase of the force at frequency ω. If the harmonic
oscillator represents, say, a superconducting LC oscilla-
tor, then a capacitive coupling to a time-dependent small
classical gate voltage can similarly induce small displace-
ments that one may wish to measure.

Now imagine that this perfect grid state undergoes
a small displacement exp(−iuˆp + iv ˆq) [4] (equal to
exp(−iuˆp) exp(iv ˆq) modulo an overall phase) with un-
known parameters u, v in a small interval. The goal is
to estimate the value of the parameters u and v.
In
order to determine u and v, one measures the eigen-
values of Sp and Sq. The shifted perfect grid state
|ψgrid
u,v (cid:105) is an eigenstate of Sp and Sq with eigenvalues
Sp |ψgrid
2πu |ψgrid
u,v (cid:105).
We note that only when u and v lie in the interval

[−(cid:112)π/2,(cid:112)π/2) do the eigenvalues of Sp and Sq uniquely

u,v (cid:105) and Sq |ψgrid

√

√

determine the parameters u, v. By measuring Sp and Sq
we do not measure the value of position and momentum,
√
instead we measure the position and momentum modulo
2π, and thus the accuracy with which one determines
u and v is not immediately limited by Heisenberg uncer-
tainty or principles of ‘measurement back-action’ [3]. The
price we pay for this enhanced accuracy is that, ﬁrstly, it
is only possible to determine suﬃciently small displace-
ments. Secondly, the (perfect) grid state is a highly non-
classical state which may be hard to realize experimen-

tally. The idea behind the grid state is the idea of quan-
tum error detection: grid states were originally proposed
by Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill in [1] to represent a
qubit in a bosonic mode so that displacement errors can
be detected and corrected.

A most natural sensor state that one can consider for
displacement sensing is a coherent state |α(cid:105). For such
a coherent sensor state it is clear that the shot noise
in both quadratures, i.e. the variances Var(ˆp) = 1
2 and
Var(ˆq) = 1
2 , limits the accuracy with which one can de-
termine the parameters in a displacement D(β) mapping
|α(cid:105) onto |α + β(cid:105). Using squeezed states would improve
sensitivity for one of the shift parameters while at the
same time losing accuracy in estimating the other pa-
rameter.

A most eﬀective way of determining an unknown dis-
placement is to let such a displacement act on only one
mode of a two-mode squeezed state as in the superdense
coding protocol introduced by Kimble and Braunstein
[5]. The inﬁnitely-squeezed two-mode squeezed state –
the paradigmatic EPR state– is a simultaneous eigenstate
of both the diﬀerence of the positions of the oscillators
ˆq1 − ˆq2 and the sum of the momenta ˆp1 + ˆp2, this being
possible because these operators commute. A displace-
ment acting on one of the modes maps the inﬁnitely-
squeezed state onto a set of orthogonal states. For ﬁ-
nite amounts of squeezing one can describe the perfor-
mance of such a sensing protocol by the mutual infor-
mation obtained between the input displacement ‘signal’
β, described by some prior probability distribution, and
the estimated output signal ˜β.
In the superdense cod-
ing protocol this information is obtained through homo-
dyne measurements on the two modes and the informa-
tion that is gained has been shown to scale as Θ(log n)
with n the average number of photons [5]. Unlike the
idea of the single-mode displacement sensor based on the
grid state, this two-mode displacement sensor is also ef-
fective when the displacements are large, i.e. there is no
restriction that |β| takes values in a small interval.

Another simple method of measuring a displacement
is to have two bosonic probe modes which both undergo
the same displacement D(β). One probe mode will be
prepared in a squeezed position state, the other probe
mode in a squeezed momentum state, so that both shifts
can be determined with high accuracy bounded by the
amount of squeezing available.

The goal of this paper is to show that for small dis-
placements the use of two modes of which either only
one or both undergo the unknown displacement is un-
necessary: using a single-mode grid state sensor one can
get displacement information which also gets better with
the number of photons in the state.

[7–10]. It has been argued in [6] that this state equal to

|ψcomp(cid:105) ∝ |α(cid:105) + |−α(cid:105) + |iα(cid:105) + |−iα(cid:105) ,

has a phase space structure in the central interference
region (see Fig. (1) with interference ‘tiles’ with an area ∼
(2π)2/n, thus allowing for a sensitivity which increases
with n. The quantum compass state can also be viewed
as the state |+(cid:105) = 1√
(|0(cid:105) + |1(cid:105)) of the cat code |0(cid:105) ∝
|α(cid:105) + |−α(cid:105)) and |1(cid:105) ∝ |iα(cid:105) + |−iα(cid:105). A small |α| kitten
version of this state has been recently used to show that
one can store a qubit in a microwave cavity using error
correction via the coupling with transmon qubits [11].
When n (cid:29) |β| one can show that (cid:104)ψcomp| D(β)|ψcomp(cid:105) ∝
√
cos(αIm(β)) + cos(αRe(β)) so that if Im(β) = Re(β) =
π/(2α) ∼ π/
n, i.e. the displaced state is orthogonal to
|ψcomp(cid:105) itself. The state is thus sensitive to very small
√
displacements of strength |β| ∼ 1/
n, but that does not
imply that it performs well when |β| lies in a constant
range larger than 1/

The task of determining the displacement parameters
u and v can be viewed as a problem in quantum esti-
mation theory on which there is a comprehensive lit-
erature, e.g.
[12–16]. The relevant question here is:
given the pure state |ψu,v(cid:105) = exp(−iuˆp + iv ˆq)|ψ(cid:105) where
|ψ(cid:105) is the sensor state, how well can we estimate u, v
using a single quantum measurement? The quantum
measurement is given by operation elements {Ex} with
leading to outcomes x with probability
P(x|u, v) = TrEx |ψu,v(cid:105)(cid:104)ψu,v|. On the basis of an out-
come x one chooses an estimator for u as ˜u(x) and for v
as ˜v(x). The quantum version of the Cram´er-Rao bound
relates the covariance matrix of the estimators at a point
(u, v) to the quantum Fisher information assuming that
the estimators ˜u(x) and ˜v(x) are unbiased, meaning that
P(x|u, v)(˜v(x) − v) = 0
at the point (u, v). In the Suppl. Material we provide
a self-contained derivation of this two-parameter quan-
tum Cram´er-Rao bound for completeness. The bound
says that the estimator covariance matrix Σ ≥ F −1
where F is the 2 × 2 quantum Fisher matrix whose
2 (cid:104)ψu,v| LiLj + LjLi |ψu,v(cid:105) with Li
entries are Fij = 1
the so-called symmetric logarithmic derivative opera-
tor. For a pure sensor state undergoing a unitary dis-
placement, one can ﬁnd Li=u = −2i[ˆp,|ψu,v(cid:105)(cid:104)ψu,v|] and
Li=v = 2i[ˆq,|ψu,v(cid:105)(cid:104)ψu,v|], see the tools in [15, 17]. As
a consequence of the matrix inequality one can obtain
the following lower bound on the sum of variances (with
P(x|u, v)(˜u(x) − u)2 for an unbiased esti-

Var(˜u) = (cid:80)

mator ˜u) at a point (u, v):

x

Var(˜u) + Var(˜v) ≥ Tr(F −1).

Another state that has been suggested as a good dis-
placement sensor state is the single-mode quantum com-
pass state [6], also known as a particular cat code state

The Fisher matrix for the displacement problem can be
found to be equal to the covariance matrix of the posi-
tion and momentum observables with respect to the state

In addition,

For the quantum compass state, the grid state and a pho-
ton number state |n(cid:105) at the symmetry point u = v = 0,
this minimal lower bound holds since (cid:104)ψ0,0| ˆp|ψ0,0(cid:105) =
(cid:104)ψ0,0| ˆq |ψ0,0(cid:105) = 0 and (cid:104)ψ0,0| ˆpˆq |ψ0,0(cid:105) = 0 due to the sym-
metry of these states in phase space (see the invariance
under the phase space rotation ˆp → ˆq, ˆq → −ˆp in Fig. 1).
By contrast, for single-mode Gaussian states ((ther-
mal) squeezed or coherent states), Ref. [15] has shown
that Var(˜u) + Var(˜v) ≥ 2.
for a pure
two-mode squeezed state, in the limit of large squeez-
ing, Ref.
[15] obtains the same lower bound as in
Eq. (2), which the superdense coding protocol eﬀectively
achieves. The bound shows that it may be possible to
suppress the variances of both displacement parameters
simultaneously for increasing photon number, but there
are several caveats that make this kind of bound less
useful in practice. First of all, one wishes to perform a
quantum measurement which is independent of the value
of u and v (as one does not know u and v), thus tight-
ness results of any quantum Cram´er-Rao lower bound
by a speciﬁc u, v-dependent local measurement are not
directly interesting. Secondly, it is known that in the
two-parameter case, the matrix version of the quantum
bound is generically not tight. A version of the bound
which more directly bounds the sum of variances (see
Suppl. Mat.)
is not expected to be tight due to the
non-commutativity of Lu and Lv, which in turn is due
to the non-commutativity of ˆp and ˆq. However, between
achieving the minimal lower bound in Eq. (2) and being
stuck with variances which cannot be driven down by in-
creasing photon numbers, there is still substantial room
for interesting behavior which we will now discuss.

One can use phase estimation for the operators Sp and
Sq applied to a vacuum input state to generate a grid
state |ψgrid(cid:105): an approximate eigenstate of Sp and Sq
with a bounded number of photons. Then, after a dis-
placement with parameters u and v, one executes the
same phase estimation for Sp and Sq to measure the
change in their eigenvalues. An example of a Wigner
function of a ﬁnite photon number grid state is shown in
Fig. 1: this state has been generated by the protocol in [2]
using adaptive phase estimation for Sp and Sq applied to
a vacuum input state. The (approximate) measurement
of the eigenvalue eiθ of a unitary operator U , and the
simultaneous projection of the input state onto the cor-
responding eigenstate U |ψθ(cid:105) = eiθ |ψθ(cid:105), is called phase
estimation for U (and thus has nothing to do with es-
timating an unknown phaseshift φ in an expression like
exp(iφa†a)). Phase estimation can be executed by re-
peatedly (and sequentially) coupling the oscillator state
to a qubit as depicted in Fig. 2, where one can vary k and
(feedback) phases ϕ. The best form of phase estimation

One can ask for the minimal value of the lower bound

optimizes the accuracy on the phase, that is, minimizes
the variance of θ, given an average number of photons
n in the prepared state [18]. In this context it is impor-
tant to note that when U is a displacement operator such
as Sp or Sq, performing a controlled-U k gate adds ∼ k2
photons to a state. Sequential phase estimation protocols
which minimize the variance for a given overall running
time T have been proposed [19] (with an improved analy-
sis in [20]) under the assumption that applying U k takes
time scaling linearly with k. These protocols give no ad-
vantage in this setting as the number of photons scales
quadratically, instead of linear with k for (controlled)-U k.
Instead we have argued in [2] that for a M -round sim-
ple repeated phase estimation protocol with k = 1 (with
ﬁxed phases ϕ = 0 and ϕ = π/2) as well as for textbook
phase estimation, executed sequentially, one gets a phase
variance Var(θ) ∼ 1√

.

˜v

) with MSD(˜v) =(cid:80)

Here we go one step beyond this and explicitly show
that, using textbook phase estimation for preparing the
grid state and measuring this state after the displace-
ment, one obtains estimators ˜u and ˜v for which it holds
that the sum of the mean square deviations MSD(˜u) +
P(˜v|v)(˜v−v)2. As
MSD(˜v) = Θ( 1√
n
the estimator is slightly biased one uses the MSD instead
of the variance. Even though this choice of phase estima-
tion may not be the most eﬃcient in practice (see [2]),
the analysis of this protocol is analytically feasible and
straightforward [21]. One expects that the approximate
grid states introduced in [1] and grid states obtained via
other (phase estimation) preparation procedures to have
similar scaling with photon number. For textbook phase
estimation one can get an exact expression for the prob-
ability P(˜v|v) (and identically P(˜u|u)) (see Suppl. Mate-
rial), namely

hence scaling as ∼ 1/

I is necessary so that large errors at the boundaries are
avoided. The bias of the estimators ˜v, ˜u makes the diﬀer-
ence between the MSD and variance in fact negliglible, of
O(2−2M ) = O(n−1). Details of this derivation are given
in the Suppl. Material.

Unlike for the grid state we do not see an obvious way
to obtain such 1√
scaling for the sum of variances for a

quantum compass state nor for a photon number state
sensor [22].

S(ρ) which holds in the limit of large photon number n.
We can also compare the information in the grid state to
displacement information when we choose a photon num-
ber state |n(cid:105) as a sensor state. Again we upper bound the
accessible information about the displacement by the von

noise during the execution of the basic protocol will re-
duce the quality of the state, leading to a larger uncer-
tainty in the phases of Sp and Sq and a diminished sensi-
tivity. We expect that the practical performance of these
states will be optimal at some photon number n instead
of continuing to increase with n. The reason is that hav-
ing more photons in the sensor state implies that other
sources of noise will act as larger unwanted displacements
on this state (after all, the state is a sensitive instrument
for detecting noise), thus making it harder for the actual
signal to be detected.

Accessible Information About Displacement
Obtained by Phase Estimation on Grid State

Let the preparation of the grid state starting from the
vacuum state result in M -bit strings xp and xq for the
measurement of Sp and Sq respectively, leading to a pure
grid (cid:105). Then an unknown displacement D(β) =
state |ψxp,xq
exp(−iuˆp + iv ˆq) occurs where u, v are assumed to be uni-

formly distributed in the interval u, v ∈ [−(cid:112)π/2,(cid:112)π/2).

We then perform phase estimation measurements of Sp
and Sq again using M ancillas, giving output bitstrings
x(cid:48)
p, x(cid:48)
q. See Figs. 4,5. The accessible information of this
protocol is the mutual information between the variables
u, v and the measurement data xp, xq, x(cid:48)
p. Of course,
the data xp, xq do not depend on the displacement, but
including this data and not ﬁxing a particular input state
allows us to include the possible variation in quality of
the input state (in this analysis of phase estimation it
turns out not to matter).

q, x(cid:48)

If the preparation of the state and the measurement
are perfect quantum circuits, the process of gaining in-
formation about u is identical and independent of the
process of gaining information about v. One can com-
mute through operators as in Fig. 5 so that one ﬁrst
prepares an approximate eigenstate of Sp, the displace-
ment exp(iv ˆq) acts and one approximately measures the
eigenvalue of Sp. After this step the same process with
displacement exp(−iuˆp) happens for Sq [24].
Thus the accessible information is the sum of the mu-
tual information between u and xq, x(cid:48)
q and the mutual
information between v and xp, x(cid:48)
p. Since these two con-
tributions are identical, we can take one process, say, for
Sp and displacement eiv ˆq and compute the mutual infor-
mation for that one. We will drop the label p from x and
x(cid:48) for notational convenience from now on.
Let ˜v be the estimate for v, given the data x, x(cid:48) and let
P(˜v|v) the probability for ˜v given v. The mutual infor-
mation I(v : ˜v) = H(˜v) − H(˜v|v), with Shannon entropy
H(˜v), can be written as

P(˜v|v) log

P(˜v|v)

dv. Note that the estimates ˜v

will take a discrete set of values while v ranges in princi-
ple continuously over the allowed interval. However, as is
clear from the above expression, discretizing v is equiva-
lent to replacing the continuous integration by a Riemann
sum and hence does not eﬀect the mutual information.
We determine P(˜v|v) assuming that the phase estima-
tion protocol is executed using textbook phase estimation
[21, 25], using circuits of the form depicted in Fig. 4. Let
N = 2M . We can capture the phase estimation circuits

FIG. 4. Circuits used in the sequential implemention of textbook phase estimation for the unitary operator Sp. This sequential
realization of phase estimation is identical to normal phase estimation as it merely uses a semi-classical realization of the
quantum Fourier transform so that a single qubit is used in each round (see for example [23]). Assume that phase estimation
uses M ancillas prepared in |00 . . . 0(cid:105). The top circuit in this Figure is repeatedly executed for k = M − 1, . . . , 1 starting at
k = M − 1, each circuit using one qubit. For k = 0 we use the circuit at the bottom, i.e. we do not apply the unconditional
−1/2
displacement S
: this has no eﬀect on the phase estimation protocol, but ensures that the measurement for Sp and Sq fully
p
commute. The only reason to have the unconditional displacement in the top circuit is that one minizes the overall number of
photons used in the protocol by doing so. The phase ϕ in Rz(ϕ) will depend on the outcomes of all previously measured qubits
in accordance with the description of the semi-classical Fourier transform.

How does x, x(cid:48) → ˜v take place: this is essentially de-
scribed by the phase estimation algorithm [21, 25].
In
the usual analysis in phase estimation, the goal is to get
a ˜M -bit estimate ˜v for v where M = ˜M +(cid:100)log2(2 + 1

This shows that for ﬁnite α, the MSD scales at most as

bound the MSD by at most a constant, not decreasing
with N , due to the fact that the wrong estimates for v
at the edges of the interval can have large error.

As the phase estimation measurement for Sp commutes
with the phase estimation measurement for Sq, the prob-
ability P(˜u|u) is the same as for ˜v and v, and therefore
the MSD is identical.

Due to having a ﬁnite mesh of values for ˜v, the esti-
mator ˜v (and similarly ˜u), is not completely unbiased.

Two-Parameter Quantum Cram´er-Rao bound

We provide a self-contained derivation of the two-
parameter quantum Cram´er-Rao bound which,
in
slightly diﬀerent form, was originally derived in [12]. We
then consider this bound for the problem of displacement
sensing using a pure state. We start by deriving a weaker
bound in Eq. (8) for which we discuss the reasons why it
will not be tight. Then we derive the matrix inequality
quantum Cram´er-Rao bound which is stated in the main
text.
Let θ1 and θ2 be two (real) parameters and let
P(x|θ1, θ2) be the probability distribution over the data
x given the two parameters. Given a quantum state wich
depends on the parameters ρθ1,θ2, P(x|θ1, θ2) may be ob-
tained through a quantum measurement with outcomes
x Ex = I (and TrS is
just the trace over the system Hilbert space). We will be
interested in bounding the variance of any locally unbi-
ased estimator ˜θi(x) for θi around the point (θ1, θ2). For
such a locally unbiased estimator at (θ1, θ2) it holds that

One can examine whether one can achieve this bound
in the single or multi-parameter case; this depends on
whether inequality (I) and (II) are tight. However, as
is well known, a measurement which achieves this bound
typically depends on the parameter to be estimated and
is thus not of immediate interest (see [27] for optimal
parameter-value independent measurement in the single-
parameter case with pure states). Here we brieﬂy argue
why it is unlikely that the bound can be achieved for
the two-parameter displacement estimation problem on
pure states. We conjecture that Var(˜θ1) + Var(˜θ2) ≥
c√
n with some constant c is the best one can hope for.
This scaling of the sum of variances is precisely what
is achieved for the parameter-value independent phase
estimation measurement on a displaced grid state.

The Schwarz inequality (II) is tight when we have
∃µ,∀x, i : E1/2
. (9)
We restrict ourselves to pure states ρθ1,θ2 = |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ| where
ψ = ψ(θ1, θ2). For a pure state it can be shown that
Lθi = 2i[Kθi,|ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|] with hermitian Kθi . Let us ﬁrst re-
examine tightness in the single parameter case. One can
choose a measurement Ex which is a projective measure-
ment in the eigenbasis of Lθ. This choice then determines
the choice for ˜θ(x) as a function of x and the eigenval-
ues of Lθ. As an example let 2iKθ |ψ(cid:105) = |dψK(cid:105) and

assume that we work at a point ψ(θ) where (cid:104)dψK| ψ(cid:105) ∝
(cid:104)ψ| K |ψ(cid:105) = 0. We have

Lθ = dXK(|+K(cid:105)(cid:104)+K| − |−K(cid:105)(cid:104)−K|),

where dXK =(cid:112)(cid:104)dψK| dψK(cid:105) and |±K(cid:105) = 1√
with |ψK(cid:105) = |dψK(cid:105) /(cid:112)(cid:104)dψK| dψK(cid:105). The measurement

{Ex} in the eigenbasis of LK is a measurement in the
orthogonal basis |±K(cid:105) and states spanning the space or-
thogonal to |±K(cid:105) (the latter have zero probability given
that the inﬁnitesimal deviation of the state is only in
the direction of |ψK(cid:105)). Upon outcomes x = ±, Eq. (9)
constrains how to choose ˜θ(±), i.e.

(|ψ(cid:105)±|ψK(cid:105))

2

∃µ, ˜θ(±) − θ = ±µdXK.

Note that this last equality does not ﬁx the unbiased
estimator due to the freedom of µ. With such choice
of measurement, the ﬁrst inequality, (I), is also satisﬁed
since all quantities involved are real.

In the two-parameter case the operators Lθ1 and Lθ2
may not be commuting implying that a basis in which
both are diagonalized does not exist. Let us in par-
ticular consider the displacement case for pure states
to understand what goes wrong.
In this case we have
Kθ1 = −ˆp and Kθ2 = ˆq. For simplicity, we consider
displacement deviations of a pure state |ψ(cid:105) with the
property that (cid:104)ψ| ˆp|ψ(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ| ˆq |ψ(cid:105) = 0 and further-
more (cid:104)ψ| ˆpˆq |ψ(cid:105) = −i/2 (as (cid:104)ψ| ˆpˆq |ψ(cid:105) = −(cid:104)ψ| ˆq ˆp|ψ(cid:105)).
These properties hold for the photon number state, grid
state and quantum compass state in this paper (when
these states are symmetrically centered around the vac-
uum state in phase phase). In general the expectation
(cid:104)ψ| ˆpˆq |ψ(cid:105) equals −i/2 plus the expectation value of a
Hermitian operator and can thus never be real!

Let |ψp(cid:105) = |dψp(cid:105) /(cid:112)(cid:104)dψp| dψp(cid:105) and similarly |ψq(cid:105).
(cid:112)(cid:104)dψp| dψp(cid:105) =(cid:112)(cid:104)dψq| dψq(cid:105) =

For the states considered we have dX = dXp =
4n + 2, showing that a
small displacement leads to a change in the state which

2n+1 . If |ψp(cid:105) and |ψq(cid:105) were orthogonal it can

grows with photon number. This in turn implies that
(cid:104)ψp| ψq(cid:105) = −i
be shown that one can construct a rank-1 four-outcome
POVM measurement which saturates I and II. How-
ever, for the displacement problem ψp and ψq are non-
orthogonal, although their innerproduct vanishes as 1/n.

Matrix Inequality

We derive the more stringent matrix version of the two-
parameter quantum Cram´er-Rao bound Σ ≥ F −1. The
covariance matrix Σ of the unbiased estimators ˜θi(x) is
deﬁned as

P(x|θ1, θ2)(˜θi(x) − θi)(˜θj(x) − θj),

so that Var(˜θ1) + Var(˜θ2) = Tr(Σ). Deﬁne L(a) =

leading to Σ ≥ F −1. From Σ ≥ F −1 it follows that
Var(˜θ1) + Var(˜θ2) ≥ Tr(F −1).
