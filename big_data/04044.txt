Abstract

We use a theorem by Ding, Lubetzky and Peres describing the structure of the giant component
of random graphs in the strictly supercritical regime, in order to determine the typical size of

MAXCUT of G ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε
n (cid:1) in terms of ε. We then apply this result to prove the following
conjecture by Frieze and Pegden. For every ε > 0 there exists ℓε such that w.h.p. G ∼ G(n, 1+ε
n )
is not homomorphic to the cycle on 2ℓε + 1 vertices. We also consider the coloring properties of
biased random tournaments. A p-random tournament on n vertices is obtained from the transitive
tournament by reversing each edge independently with probability p. We show that for p = Θ( 1
n )
the chromatic number of a p-random tournament behaves similarly to that of a random graph
with the same edge probability. To treat the case p = 1+ε
n we use the aforementioned result on
MAXCUT.

Introduction

Given a graph G, a bipartition of G is a partition of V (G) into two sets, V (G) = V1⊎V2. The cut of
the partition (V1, V2) is the set of edges with one end-point in each Vi. The MAXCUT problem asks to
ﬁnd the size of a largest cut in G. We denote this number by MAXCUT(G). The problem of ﬁnding
MAXCUT(G) has been extensively studied. It is known to be very important in both combinatorics
and theoretical computer science, and has some connections to physics. The MAXCUT problem is
known to be NP-hard (see [24, 33]) and even not approximable to within a factor of 16
17 unless P = N P
(see [26]). On the other hand, as shown by Goemans and Williamson [25], there is a semideﬁnite
programming algorithm that approximates MAXCUT to a factor of 0.87856. Moreover, for dense
graphs there are polynomial time approximation schemes for MAXCUT(G), which approximate it
up to an additive factor of o(n2), as shown by Arora, Karger and Karpinski in [4], and by Frieze and
Kannan in [21].

One natural generalization of the MAXCUT problem is the MAX k-CUT problem that asks an
analogous question about k-partitions of a graph. A k-partition of G is a partition of V (G) into k

sets, V (G) = V1 ⊎ ··· ⊎ Vk. The k-cut of the partition (V1, . . . , Vk) is the set of edges connecting
vertices in diﬀerent parts. The MAX k-CUT problem asks to ﬁnd the size of a largest k-cut in G.
Extending the methods of [25], Frieze and Jerrum found in [20] an algorithm that approximates
MAX k-CUT up to a known constant factor αk < 1.

For any graph G = (V, E), ﬁnding MAXCUT(G) is clearly equivalent to ﬁnding the maximal
number of edges in a bipartite subgraph of G. The distance of G from bipartiteness is deﬁned to be
the minimal number of edges whose removal turns G into a bipartite graph. We denote the distance
by DistBP(G). Obviously, DistBP(G) = |E|− MAXCUT(G). So asking for the size of a maximum cut
in G is equivalent to asking for the distance of G from bipartiteness. In general, it is often convenient
to consider the fraction of edges that need to be removed in order to make G satisfy some graph
property (in our case bipartiteness). We say that a graph G on n vertices is δ-far from satisfying a
graph property P if its distance from P is at least δ|E(G)|. Otherwise, we say that G is δ-close to
P.

In this paper we consider the maximum cut in a random graph. We work in the binomial random
graph model G(n, p). This is the probability space that consists of all graphs with n labeled vertices,

where each one of the (cid:0)n
2(cid:1) possible edges is chosen independently with probability p. The study of
the typical value of MAXCUT in the model G(n, p) has a long history. For starters, if p is not too
small, say p ≫ n−1/2 log n, then one can check (using simple probabilistic tools) that the size of the
MAXCUT of a typical G ∼ G(n, p) is n2p
4 (1 + o(1)). The problem is more interesting for smaller p,
speciﬁcally p = Θ(cid:0) 1
n (for a large
enough constant c), does not have a cut with signiﬁcantly more than half the edges. In 2010, Bayati,
Gamarnik and Tetali ([5]) proved that for any c > 0, the random variable n−1 · MAXCUT(cid:0)G(cid:0)n, c
n(cid:1)(cid:1)

n(cid:1). It was shown in [17] that a random graph G(n, p) with p = c

converges in probability to a single value M C(c) (as n tends to inﬁnity). They also established a
similar result for the random regular graph model Gn,r. Asymptotic bounds on M C(c) were obtained
by Coppersmith et al. (see [10]), Gamarnik and Li (see [23]) and Feige and Ofek (see [18]). All these
4 + β√c + o(√c), where α, β are known
bounds are of the form c
absolute constants and the little-o notation is with respect to c. Recently, Dembo, Montanari and
Sen found the correct asymptotic behavior of M C(c) up to an error of o(√c); they proved that
4 + o(√c), where γ ≈ 0.7632. They also obtained a similar result for random
M C(c) = c
regular graphs (see [13]).

4 + α√c + o(√c) ≤ M C(c) ≤ c

4 + γp c

The above results cover the case when c is large. We, however, focus on the range around the
phase transition value p = 1
n . It is known that the typical structure of G (n, p) changes signiﬁcantly
as p increases above this value; the giant component appears together with other graph properties.
MAXCUT also has a phase transition at p = 1

|E(G)| − MAXCUT(G) is O(1) in expectation if c < 1, and typically Ω(n) if c > 1.

number of unicyclic components has a Poisson limiting distribution with an expected value of O(1)
(see section 5.4 in [8]). This means that in expectation, the distance of G from bipartiteness, which

to δ = Θ(ε3). Moreover, they showed that the expectation of DistBP(G) is O(ε3)n. We prove that

Sorkin (see [10]), who showed that if p = 1+ε

this conjecture is indeed true.

The regime p = c

Theorem 1.1. Let ε ∈ (0, 1), then G ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε

n (cid:1) is w.h.p. δ-far from being bipartite for δ = Θ(ε3).
n for c > 1, which is considered in this paper, is called the strictly supercritical
regime. We note that the problem of ﬁnding the typical distance to bipartiteness has also been
considered in the following regimes: the strictly subcritical regime p = c
n for c < 1; the subcritical
regime p = 1−µ
n for µ = Θ(cid:0)n−1/3(cid:1); the supercritical
regime p = 1+µ
for n−1/3 ≪ µ ≪ 1. For all these regimes, Daud´e, Mart´ınez, Rasendrahasina and
n
Ravelomanana found the limit distribution of a normalization of DistBP(G) (see [12] for the details).
For the subcritical regime and the scaling window, Scott and Sorkin [32] showed that a maximum
cut of a random graph can be found in linear expected time by a simple algorithm.

n for n−1/3 ≪ µ ≪ 1; the scaling window p = 1±µ

We note that the MAX k-CUT problem was also studied in several models of random graphs,

such as G(n, p), G(n, m), and the random regular graph model Gn,r (see, [7, 10, 11, 28]).

The key ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1.1 is the characterization of the giant component of

random graphs in the strictly supercritical regime, obtained by Ding, Lubetzky and Peres in [15].

We use Theorem 1.1 to address two supposedly unrelated problems. The ﬁrst problem is related
to the chromatic number of random graphs and homomorphisms of random graphs. We ﬁrst give
relevant deﬁnitions for general graphs. A graph G is called k-colorable if there exists a coloring
c : V (G) → [k] = {1, 2, . . . , k} such that if v ∼ u then c(v) 6= c(u). The chromatic number of a graph
G, denoted by χ(G), is the minimal k for which G is k-colorable. A graph homomorphism ϕ from a
graph G = (V, E) to a graph G′ = (V ′, E′), is a (not necessarily injective) mapping ϕ : V → V ′ from
the vertex set of G to the vertex set of G′ such that if {v, u} ∈ E(G) then {ϕ(v), ϕ(u)} ∈ E(G′).
We simply denote this mapping by ϕ : G → G′. By the deﬁnition, we can see that a graph G is
k-colorable if and only if there exists a homomorphism ϕ : G → Kk, where Kk is the complete graph
on k vertices. For a graph G and an integer ℓ ≥ 1, a homomorphism ϕ : G → C2ℓ+1 implies a
homomorphism ϕ′ : G → C2k+1 for every k ∈ [ℓ] = {1, ..., ℓ}, where Cr is the cycle with r vertices. In
particular, a graph G is 3-colorable if there exists a homomorphism ϕ : G → C2ℓ+1 for some integer
ℓ ≥ 1 (as this implies a homomorphism ϕ′ : G → C3). The opposite direction is not always true. For
example, the graph G = C3 is 3-colorable but is not homomorphic to any C2ℓ+1 for ℓ ≥ 2. Thus, by
considering homomorphisms from a graph G to C2ℓ+1, we can measure how “strong” the property
of 3-colorability is in a given graph G.

Here we will consider this notion in the random graph model G(n, p) (see, e.g., Chapter 7 of [27]
for a detailed overview of coloring properties of random graphs). In the case of random graphs, it is
known that for p = c
n where c > 1 we have that w.h.p. G ∼ G(n, p) is not 2-colorable, that is, w.h.p.
χ(G) ≥ 3 (see, e.g., [8, 27]). In their paper [22], Frieze and Pegden proved the following.
Theorem 1.2. For any ℓ > 1, there is an ε > 0 such that with high probability, G ∼ G(n, 1+ε
n )
either has odd-girth < 2ℓ + 1 or has a homomorphism to C2ℓ+1 (the cycle of length 2ℓ + 1).

In Theorem 1.2 the size of the cycle, 2ℓ + 1, is ﬁxed, and ε (and thus the edge probability p)
depends on ℓ. It is also natural to ask, for a ﬁxed probability, about the values of ℓ for which there is
a homomorphism from the random graph to C2ℓ+1. Frieze and Pegden conjectured that the following
is true.

Conjecture 1.3 (Conjecture 1 in [22]). For any c > 1, there is an ℓc such that with high probability,
there is no homomorphism from G ∼ G(n, c

n ) to C2ℓ+1 for any ℓ ≥ ℓc.

3

In Section 4 we give a proof of this conjecture using Theorem 1.1. We show the following.

Theorem 1.4. For any ε > 0, there is an ℓε such that with high probability, there is no homomor-
phism from G ∼ G(n, 1+ε

n ) to C2ℓ+1 for any ℓ ≥ ℓε. In fact, ℓε = O(cid:0) 1
ε3(cid:1).

The second application of Theorem 1.1 is related to colorability of biased random tournaments.
Let us look at the following random tournament model. We start with Kn and order its vertices in the
natural order (1, 2, 3, . . . , n). A p-random tournament on n vertices, T ∼ T (n, p), is a tournament for
which −→ji ∈ E(T ) with probability p and −→ij ∈ E(T ) with probability 1 − p, for every 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n
independently. Observe trivially that for p = o(1) most of the edges of T ∼ T (n, p) typically
point forward, explaining our terminology of a biased random tournament.
In some cases, it is
more natural to view this model as a perturbation of the transitive tournament: we start with the
transitive tournament on [n] and then choose each oriented edge with probability 2p and re-orient
it uniformly at random. We refer the reader to [29] for more details regarding this model and other
related models.

We say that a tournament is k-colorable if there exists a coloring f : [n] → [k] of its vertex
set V = [n] such that for every i ∈ [k] the sub-tournament induced by the vertices with color i
is transitive. The chromatic number of a tournament T , denoted by χ(T ), is the minimal k for
which T is k-colorable. In the past few years there has been extensive research into the chromatic
number of tournaments and related concepts. Much of the work dealt with the chromatic number
of tournaments with some forbidden substructure. Most notably, Berger et al. characterized the
tournaments that are heroes (see [6]). A tournament H is called a hero if there exists C > 0 such
that every H-free tournament G satisﬁes χ(G) ≤ C. See [9] for some more results of this nature.

In this paper we will show that the coloring properties of p-random tournaments are similar to
those of the random graph model G(n, p). In the case of random graphs, it is known that for k ≥ 3
we have a sharp threshold for G ∼ G(n, p) being k-colorable. In particular, it is known that for c > 0,
G ∼ G(n, c
n ) satisﬁes w.h.p. χ(G) ∈ {k, k + 1}, where k is the smallest integer such that c < 2k log k
(see [1, 2, 30]). However, in the case of 2-colorability we observe an entirely diﬀerent phenomenon
(see, e.g., Chapter 5 in [8]). For c ∈ (0, 1], one can see that a graph G ∼ G(n, c
n ) contains an odd
cycle with probability bounded away from zero (as a function of c), and therefore χ(G) > 2 with
probability bounded away from zero. On the other hand, G is acyclic with probability bounded away
from zero (as a function of c), and thus χ(G) ≤ 2 with probability bounded away from zero. Recall
that if c > 1, then for p = c
n and G ∼ G(n, p) w.h.p. χ(G) > 2. We show that in the case of p-random
tournaments the behavior is similar.
Theorem 1.5. Let ε ∈ (0, 1) and let T ∼ T (n, 1−ε
cε ≤ Pr [χ(T ) ≤ 2] ≤ 1 − c′

We actually prove something stronger. We show that one needs to reverse a linear number of
edges of a typical T ∼ T (n, 1+ε
n ) for it to become bipartite (2-colorable). The distance of T from
bipartiteness, denoted by DistTour-BP(T ), is the minimal number of edges that need to be reversed
to make T bipartite.

1.1 Notation and terminology

Our graph-theoretic notation is standard and follows that of [34]. In particular we use the follow-

ing:

For a graph G, let V = V (G) and E = E(G) denote its set of vertices and edges, respectively. We
let v(G) = |V | and e(G) = |E|. For a subset U ⊆ V we denote by EG(U ) all the edges e ∈ E with
both endpoints in U . For subsets U, W ⊆ V we denote by EG(U, W ) all the edges e ∈ E with both
endpoints in U ∪W for which e∩U 6= ∅ and e∩W 6= ∅. We simply write E(U ) or E(U, W ) in the cases
where there is no risk of confusion. We also write eG(U ) = |EG(U )| and eG(U, W ) = |EG(U, W )|.

We assume that n is large enough where needed. We say that an event holds with high probability
(w.h.p.) if its probability tends to one as n tends to inﬁnity. For the sake of simplicity and clarity
of presentation, and in order to shorten some of the proofs, no real eﬀort is made to optimize the
constants appearing in our results. We also sometimes omit ﬂoor and ceiling signs whenever these
are not crucial.

A tournament T on [n] is an orientation of the complete graph Kn. That is, V (T ) = [n] and

for every edge {i, j} of Kn either (i, j) ∈ E(T ) or (j, i) ∈ E(T ). We usually write −→ij to mean
(i, j) ∈ E(T ) (the edge {i, j} appears with the orientation from i to j). Let U, W ⊆ V (T ) be two
disjoint subsets of vertices. We write U → W to mean that for every u ∈ U and for every w ∈ W ,
−→uw ∈ E(T ). In the case that U = {u} or W = {w} we simply write u → W or U → w, respectively
(in the case that both U = {u} and W = {w}, we sometimes write u → w to mean −→uw ∈ E(T )).
keeping only ”backwards” edges, that is V (B) = [n] and E(B) = {−→ji | i < j and −→ji ∈ E(T )}. Let

For a tournament T with V (T ) = [n] we let B = B(T ) be the oriented graph obtained from T by

R be the graph obtained from B by forgetting the orientation of the edges. R is called the backedge
graph of T .

Also let eT (X, Y ) = |ET (X, Y )| and eT (X) = |ET (X, X)|.

For a tournament T and two sets X, Y ⊂ V (T ) we write ET (X, Y ) = {−→xy ∈ E(T ) : x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }.
For an ordered set of vertices V = [n], we say that I ⊆ [n] is an interval if there exist i, j ∈
[n] such that k ∈ I if and only if i ≤ k ≤ j (that is, I = {i, i + 1, . . . , j}). For an interval
I = {i, i + 1, . . . , j − 1, j}, we denote I − = {i, i + 1, . . . , j − 1}. We deﬁne the length of I to be
|I| = j − i + 1.

2.1 Binomial distribution bounds

We use extensively the following standard bound on the lower and the upper tails of the Binomial

distribution due to Chernoﬀ (see, e.g., [3], [27]):

Lemma 2.1. Let X ∼ Bin(n, p) and µ = E(X), then
1. Pr (X < (1 − a)µ) < exp(cid:16)− a2µ
2 (cid:17) for every a > 0.
2. Pr (X > (1 + a)µ) < exp(cid:16)− a2µ
3 (cid:17) for every 0 < a < 1.
Lemma 2.2. Let X ∼ Bin(n, p) and let k > 10E(X), then Pr(X ≥ k) ≤ e−k.

We will also use the following Chernoﬀ-type bound due to Hoeﬀding (see, e.g., [3]):

Lemma 2.3. Let X ∼ Bin(n, p) and µ = E(X), then

Pr (|X − µ| > tn) < 2 exp(cid:0)−2t2n(cid:1) .

2.2 The structure of the giant component in random graphs

For the proof of Theorem 1.1 we will use a theorem by Ding, Lubetzky and Peres. First we need

the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let G = (V, E) be a graph. The 2-core of G is the maximal induced subgraph of G
with minimum degree at least two.
Theorem 2.5 (Theorem 1 in [15]). Let C be the 2-core of the largest component of G(n, p) for p = λ
n ,
where λ = 1 + ε and ε ∈ (0, 1) is ﬁxed. Let µ < 1 be such that µe−µ = λe−λ. Let ˜C be the following
model:

1. Let Λ be Gaussian N (λ − µ, 1/n) and let Du ∼ P oisson(Λ) for u ∈ [n] be i.i.d., conditioned
on the event that Pn
u=1 Du1Du≥3 is even. Let Nk = #{u : Du = k} and N = Pk≥3 Nk. Select
a random multigraph K on N vertices, uniformly among all multigraphs (possibly with loops)
that have Nk vertices of degree k for every k ≥ 3.

2. Replace the edges of K by internally disjoint paths of i.i.d Geom(1 − µ) lengths.

Then C is contiguous to the model ˜C, that is, if Pr[ ˜C ∈ A] → 0 then Pr[C ∈ A] → 0 for any set of
graphs A.

We will also use the following claims.

Claim 2.6. Let ε, λ, µ, Λ be as in Theorem 2.5. Then w.h.p. we have ε ≤ Λ ≤ 3ε.
Proof. Since λ = 1 + ε and µ < 1, we have E[Λ] = λ − µ > ε. By Chebyshev’s inequality
n(1 − µ)2 = o(1).

Pr [Λ < ε] = Pr [Λ < E[Λ] − (E[Λ] − ε)] ≤

Var[Λ]

(λ − µ − ε)2 =

Moreover, since µ is such that µe−µ = λe−λ, we have that 1 − µ < 2ε. Therefore E[Λ] = λ − µ =
ε + 1 − µ < 3ε. By Chebyshev’s inequality we have

Pr [Λ > 3ε] = Pr [Λ − E[Λ] > 3ε − E[Λ]] ≤

Var[Λ]

(λ − µ − 3ε)2 =

1

n(λ − µ − 3ε)2 = o(1)

Claim 2.7. For N , ε and n as in Theorem 2.5 we have that w.h.p. N = Θ(ε3)n.

Proof. We condition on the value of Λ and assume that ε ≤ Λ ≤ 3ε, which occurs w.h.p. by Claim
2.6. We deﬁne the following probabilities: For X ∼ Poisson(Λ), let

q≥3 = Pr[X ≥ 3],

q≤2 = Pr[X ≤ 2],
Recall that N = Pn
Poisson(Λ). Let An be the event that Pn
to show that Pr(cid:2)N /∈ Θ(ε3)n | An(cid:3) = o(1). We will show that Pr[N /∈ Θ(ε3)n] = o(1) and that

u=1 1Du≥3, where D1, ..., Dn are i.i.d random variables with the distribution
u=1 Du1Du≥3 is even. In order to prove the claim we need

q≥3,even = Pr[X ≥ 3, even],

q≥3,odd = Pr[X ≥ 3, odd]

Pr[An] = Θ(1). This would imply that

Pr(cid:2)N /∈ Θ(ε3)n | An(cid:3) ≤

Pr(cid:2)N /∈ Θ(ε3)n(cid:3)

Pr[An]

= o(1).

Observe that N ∼ Bin(n, q≥3). By the deﬁnition of the Poisson distribution we have

q≥3 = 1 − e−Λ − e−ΛΛ − e−Λ Λ2

2

= e−Λ ·(cid:18)eΛ − 1 − Λ −

Λ2

2 (cid:19) = e−Λ · Θ(Λ3) = Θ(ε3),

since we conditioned on ε ≤ Λ ≤ 3ε. By the Chernoﬀ bound we get that Pr(cid:2)N /∈ Θ(ε3)n(cid:3) = o(1).

It remains to show that pn := Pr[An] = Θ(1). By conditioning on the value of D1 we get the

following recursive formula for pn.

pn = q≥3,even · pn−1 + q≥3,odd · (1 − pn−1) + q≤2 · pn,

where pn−1 is deﬁned the same way as pn, only for n−1 i.i.d Poisson(Λ) random variables. Simplifying
the recursive formula gives:

pn = (q≤2 + q≥3,even − q≥3,odd)pn−1 + q≥3,odd.

This is a recursive formula of the form pn = apn−1 + b.
solution is pn = (p1 − b
pn = Θ(1).

1−a . So pn → b

1−a )an−1 + b

It is easy to see that since a 6= 1, the
1−a as n → ∞. Also, b = q≥3,odd 6= 0. Therefore

The following claim shows that w.h.p. the number of edges in K that touch vertices of degree at

least 4 is at most O(ε4)n.

Claim 2.8. Let ε ∈ (cid:0)0, 1
and Λ as in Theorem 2.5. Then Pr(cid:2)Pn

3(cid:1) and λ, µ,K and C be as in Theorem 2.5. Let Du ∼ P oisson(Λ) for u ∈ [n]
u=1 Du1Du≥3 is even(cid:3) = o(1) (for

u=1 Du1Du≥4 > Cε4n | Pn

some absolute constant C).

Proof. We condition on the value of Λ and assume that Λ ≤ 3ε, which occurs w.h.p. by Claim
2.6. Put Xu = Du1Du≥4 and X = Pn
u=1 Du1Du≥3 is even.
We showed in the proof of Claim 2.7 that Pr[An] = Θ(1). Therefore, in order for us to show that
Pr[X > Cε4n | An] = o(1), it is enough to show that Pr[X > Cε4n] = o(1).

3 Proof of Theorem 1.1

To prove Theorem 1.1 we need to prove the following lemma.

Lemma 3.1. Let K be a multigraph satisfying e(K) ≥ 3
2 v(K) and let 0.99 ≤ µ < 1. Replace the edges
of K by paths of i.i.d. Geom(1 − µ) lengths and denote this new (multi)graph by ˜C. Then w.h.p. we
have DistBP( ˜C) ≥ Θ(v(K)).
Proof. Denote by ℓe the length of the path that replaces the edge e ∈ E(K) in ˜C, and by Pe the set
of edges of this path. Note that

∞

Xk=1

podd := Pr(ℓe is odd) =

Pr(ℓe = k, k is odd) = Xk∈Nodd
The last inequality holds by our assumption that µ ≥ 0.99. Also,
peven := Pr(ℓe is even) = 1 − Pr(ℓe is odd) = 1 −

µk(1 − µ) =

1 − µ
1 − µ2 < 0.51.

1 − µ
1 − µ2 <

1
2

< 0.51.

We infer that podd, peven ∈ (0.49, 0.51).
Observe that if DistBP( ˜C) < α · v(K), then there exists a partition V ( ˜C) = ˜V1 ⊎ ˜V2 that satisﬁes
e( ˜V1) + e( ˜V2) < α · v(K). Consider any vertex partition of K, V (K) = V1 ⊎ V2. We will bound the
probability that ˜C has a bipartition ˜V1⊎ ˜V2 that extends V1⊎ V2 (i.e. V1 ⊆ ˜V1 and V2 ⊆ ˜V2) such that
e( ˜V1) + e( ˜V2) < α · v(K). We will then take the union bound over all bipartitions of K. Since every
bipartition of ˜C extends some bipartition of K, the union bound gives a bound on the probability
that DistBP( ˜C) < α · v(K).
Note that if an edge e ∈ K lies inside V1 or inside V2 and ℓe is odd, then at least one of the edges
in Pe must lie inside one of the parts of any extension of V1 ⊎ V2 in ˜C. Also, if an edge e ∈ K is in
E(V1, V2) and ℓe is even, then at least one of the edges in Pe must lie inside one of the parts of any
extension of V1 ⊎ V2 in ˜C. We call this kind of paths bad.
Now look at a speciﬁc partition V1 ⊎ V2 of K. For any extension ˜V1 ⊎ ˜V2 of V1, V2, the number of
edges inside ˜V1 and ˜V2 is at least the number of bad paths created from the edges of K. Let us denote

8

this number by X. Then X is stochastically dominates the random variable Y ∼ Bin(e(K), 0.49).
Therefore, for α = 0.009, by Lemma 2.3 (where t = 0.481)

Pr [X < α · v(K)] ≤ Pr [X < α · e(K)] ≤ Pr [Y < α · e(K)] < 2e−2(0.481)2e(K) < 2e−0.694v(K).

In the last inequality above we used the assumption that e(K) ≥ 3
2 v(K). By the union bound over
all partitions V1 ⊎ V2 of K we get: the probability that there exists a partition ˜V1 ⊎ ˜V2 of ˜C such that
there are less than 0.009v(K) edges inside E( ˜V1) ∪ E( ˜V2) is at most

2v(K) · 2e−0.694v(K) = 2e(log 2−0.694)v(K) = o(1).

n (cid:1) we have w.h.p. DistBP(G) ≥ cε3

0). Therefore it is enough to prove Theorem 1.1 for the case that G ∼ G(n, 1+ε

Proof of Theorem 1.1. We will show that w.h.p. the distance of G ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε
n (cid:1) from bipartiteness is
at least δn for δ = Θ(ε3). This would imply the theorem as w.h.p. we have e(G) ≤ 1+ε
2 n + o(n) ≤ n.
We can assume that ε < ε0 for some small constant ε0 (this assumption is needed to apply Lemma
3.1). Indeed, if for G ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε0
0n (where c is a constant), then by
monotonicity, for every ε > ε0 and G ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε
0n ≥ c′ε3n (where
c′ = cε3
n ) and ε is
small enough. We will show that w.h.p. we have DistBP( ˜C) ≥ δn, where ˜C is from Theorem 2.5. This
would imply, by Theorem 2.5, that w.h.p. the distance of the 2-core of G(cid:0)n, 1+ε
n (cid:1) from bipartiteness
is at least δn, ﬁnishing the proof. Let K be the multigraph generated in item 1 of Theorem 2.5. By
Claim 2.7 w.h.p. K has at least Θ(ε3)n vertices. We condition on this event. Since the degree of
every vertex in K is at least 3, we get that e(K) ≥ 3
2 v(K). Our assertion now follows from combining
Lemma 3.1 and the inequality v(K) ≥ Θ(ε3)n.
Corollary 3.2. Let ε be small enough, and let G ∼ G(n, 1+ε
the vertices of G, there is a collection of Θ(ε3)n pairwise vertex-disjoint monochromatic edges.

Proof sketch. Theorem 1.1 guarantees that in every 2-coloring of a typical G ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε

at least Θ(ε3)n monochromatic edges. In fact, the proof ﬁnds Θ(ε3)n monochromatic edges, each
lying on a path which connects two vertices of the kernel of the giant component of G. By Claim 2.8,
the number of edges in the kernel that have an endpoint of kernel-degree greater than 3 is O(ε4)n.
Ignoring these ”bad” edges, we still have Θ(ε3)n monochromatic edges with both endpoints of degree
at most 3 in the 2-core. Each such edge intersects at most 6 other such edges, so there is a collection
of Θ(ε3)n pairwise vertex-disjoint monochromatic edges.

n (cid:1) there are

Remark 3.3. Using a similar technique, we can obtain an analogue of Theorem 1.1 for random
graphs in the supercritical phase, i.e. p = 1+µ
for n−1/3 ≪ µ ≪ 1. Instead of using Theorem 2.5,
n
we need to use an analogous result that describes the structure of the giant component of random
graphs in the supercritical phase, see [14]. In this manner we can prove that for µ as above, a typical

G ∼ G(cid:16)n, 1+µ

n (cid:17) satisﬁes DistBP (G) = Θ(µ3). This has already been shown (using a diﬀerent proof

technique) in [12].

Remark 3.4. We note that there is a simple deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that w.h.p.
ﬁnds in G ∼ G(n, 1+ε
n ) a cut of size (cid:0)1 − O(cid:0)ε3(cid:1)(cid:1) e(G). By Theorem 1.1 this cut is w.h.p. optimal
up to an error of O(cid:0)ε3(cid:1) · e(G). The algorithm starts by ﬁnding the connected components of G. It
is known that w.h.p. G has a single giant component, and that the expected number of cycles not

9

contained in the giant component is O(1) (see, e.g., [27]). This means that w.h.p. the number of such
cycles is, say, o(n), implying that the small components can be cut by omitting at most o(n) edges.
As for the giant component, we restrict ourselves to its 2-core (since edges outside the 2-core are not
contained in any cycle, and thus may be added to any cut). We denote the 2-core by C. Finding the
2-core of any graph can be easily done by removing one-by-one vertices of degree at most one, until
there are none left. Theorem 2.5 describes the typical structure of C. In particular, w.h.p. C contains
vertices of degree at least 3 (these are the vertices of K). By connectivity, every cycle in C contains
such a vertex. The algorithm runs over all paths in C in which all internal vertices have degree two,
and the endpoints have degree at least three (including ”paths” (cycles) in which the two endpoints
are same; this corresponds to the fact that the multigraph K may have loops). The algorithm removes
one edge from each such path. The remaining edges form the required cut. Indeed, the remaining
graph is a forest (as it contains no cycles), and hence bipartite. The number of edges that we removed

is precisely e(K). From Theorem 2.5 we have e(K) ≤ Pu Du1Du≥3. It is not hard to check that
E [Du1Du≥3] = Θ(ε3). So by the Central Limit Theorem, w.h.p. we have Pu Du1Du≥3 ≤ Θ(ε3)n. In
conclusion, the cut produced by the algorithm misses O(cid:0)ε3(cid:1) n = O(ε3)e(G) edges.

4 A solution for Conjecture 1.3

Now we can deduce the following easily for ℓε = O(cid:0) 1
ε3(cid:1).

Theorem 4.1 (Conjecture 1 in [22]). For any ε > 0, there is an ℓε such that with high probability,
there is no homomorphism from G(n, 1+ε

n ) to C2ℓ+1 for any ℓ ≥ ℓε.

Proof. Observe that if G is homomorphic to C2ℓ+1 then one can make G bipartite by removing e(G)
2ℓ+1
edges. Indeed, assume that there exists a homomorphism ϕ : G → C2ℓ+1. Let v1, . . . v2ℓ+1 be the
vertices of C2ℓ+1 and let e1, . . . , e2ℓ+1 be the edges of C2ℓ+1 such that ei = {vi, vi+1} for every i ∈ [2ℓ]
and e2ℓ+1 = {v2ℓ+1, v1}. Since every edge of G maps into one of the ei-s, there exists a set F of
at most e(G)
2ℓ+1 edges of G, and there exists i0 such that the edges that ϕ maps to ei0 are the edges
of F . Now if we erase the edges of F from G, the homomorphism ϕ is now a homomorphism from
G′ = G \ F to a path of length 2ℓ, so G′ is 2-colorable and therefore bipartite. Thus G is
2ℓ+1 -close
to being bipartite.

2ℓ ≤ δ, so w.h.p.

Theorem 1.1, w.h.p. G is δ-far from being bipartite. Since ℓ ≥ 1
G is 1
This completes the proof.

5 Proof of Theorem 1.5

Let T ∼ T (cid:0)n, 1−ε

n (cid:1). For the lower bound, we use the following result about G(n, p): For p = 1−ε
we have Pr(cid:2)χ(cid:0)G(n, p)(cid:1) ≤ 2(cid:3) ≥ cε > 0 (see, e.g., [1, 8]). Recall that the backedge graph of T is
the graph R on the vertices [n] in which ij ∈ E(R) if and only if i < j and j → i in T .
It is
not hard to see that if R is k-colorable then so is T .
Indeed, an independent set in R spans a
transitive subtournament in T , since all the edges in it go in the same direction (forward). Moreover,

n

R ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1−ε

n (cid:1). So Pr[χ(T ) ≤ 2] ≥ Pr[χ(R) ≤ 2] ≥ cε.

10

Using the backedge graph of T ∼ T (n, p) we can also explain Remark 1.9. Indeed, for p = o(cid:0) 1
n(cid:1),
R ∼ G(n, p) and therefore w.h.p. R does not contain any odd cycle (or any cycle at all), so R is
w.h.p. 2-colorable, and so is T .

We now prove the upper bound in the theorem. Our strategy is to show that with probability at

ε (for c′

ε to be determined later) T ∼ T (cid:0)n, 1−ε

least c′
n (cid:1) contains a small non-2-colorable subtourna-
ment. Let H be the tournament on the vertices x1, ..., x7 with following edges:
x1 → x2 → x3 → x1, x4 → x5 → x6 → x4, {x1, x2, x3} → {x4, x5, x6} → x7 → {x1, x2, x3}. It is
not hard to check that H is not 2-colorable. Let j1, ..., j7 ∈ [n] such that j1 < ... < j7. We say that
(j1, ..., j7) is an ordered copy of H in T if the map xi → ji is an embedding of H into T . If T contains
an ordered copy of H then T is not 2-colorable. So let X be the number of ordered copies of H in T .
Our goal from now on is to show that Pr[X = 0] ≤ 1− c′
ε < 1. We use the Paley-Zygmund inequality
that states that

for every θ ∈ [0, 1]. Setting θ = 0 gives

For a 7-tuple J = (j1, ..., j7), let IJ be the indicator of the event that (j1, ..., j7) is an ordered
copy of H.
It is easy to see that H has 5 backedges in the order x1, ..., x7. Therefore we have

Pr [IJ = 1] = p5(1 − p)(7

2)−5 = p5(1 − p)16, where p = 1−ε

n . Therefore

E[X] = (cid:18)n

where the sum goes over all (ordered) pairs of 7-tuples. Fix two 7-tuples J1 and J2. Put k = |J1∩ J2|.
Clearly 0 ≤ k ≤ 7. Observe that there is at most one way to orient the edges inside J1 ∪ J2 so that
both J1 and J2 would be ordered copies of H. Let ℓ be the number of backedges inside J1 ∩ J2 in
this orientation (if it exists). It is not hard to check that every subset of k vertices of H contains at
most k backedges in the ordering x1, ..., x7. Therefore ℓ ≤ k. The probability that both J1 and J2

6 Proof of Theorem 1.7

In order to prove Theorem 1.7 we need some auxiliary claims about random graphs and tourna-

ments. The following is a simple fact about the maximal degree in G(n, p) where p = Θ(cid:0) 1
n(cid:1).
Claim 6.1. Let G ∼ G(n, p) where p = c
G is O(log n).

n (c > 0 is a constant). Then w.h.p. the maximal degree in

Proof. For every v ∈ V (G), let d(v) be the degree. Since d(v) ∼ Bin(n− 1, p) we have by Lemma 2.2

Pr(d(v) ≥ 5 log n) ≤ e−5 log n.

Then by the union bound, we have that for every vertex v ∈ V (G),

Pr(d(v) ≥ 5 log n) ≤ n · e−5 log n = o (1) .

Recall that the p-random tournament T (n, p) is on the (ordered) vertex set [n], and for every

B = B(T ) is the oriented graph obtained from T by keeping only backward edges, that is, V (B) = [n]

1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, −→ji ∈ E(T ) independently with probability p. For a tournament T , recall that
and E(B) = {−→ji | i < j and −→ji ∈ E(T )}. Let α > 0 be ﬁxed. We say that an edge −→ji ∈ E(B)
is α-long if j − i ≥ αn, otherwise we say that the edge is α-short. Denote the set of α-short
edges in B by Bα-short and the set of α-long edges by Bα-long. For an interval I ⊆ [n], let BI
(respectively, BI
α-long) be the set of edges e ∈ Bα-short (respectively, e ∈ Bα-long) with both endpoints
in I. Throughout this section we assume that ε is small enough.

Claim 6.2. Let T ∼ T (cid:0)n, 1+ε
n (cid:1). Let α ∈ (0, 1) be a constant. Then w.h.p. |Bα-short| ≤ 2α(1 + ε)n.
Proof. The total number of pairs {i, j} such that i < j ≤ i + αn is at most αn2. Since every
edge appears independently and with probability p = 1+ε
n , the number of α-short backedges is
stochastically dominated by a random variable distributed binomially with parameters (cid:0)αn2, 1+ε

By Chernoﬀ’s inequality (see Lemma 2.1) we have that

6 . Every vertex i in
I participates in at most αn pairs {i, j} with i < j ≤ i + αn. So the total number of possible

of possible long-edges inside I is at least (cid:0)βn
6 n2. Let mI be the size of the largest
collection of vertex-disjoint α-long backedges inside I. Fix any t ≤ cβ2n (we choose c later). We
will bound the probability that mI = t. Observe that if mI = t, then there is a collection e1, ..., et
of α-long pairwise vertex-disjoint edges, such that every other α-long edge intersects one of the ei’s.
For ﬁxed e1, ..., et, there are at least β2n2/6 − 2t · n possible α-long edges that do not intersect any
of the ei’s. Indeed, every vertex in St
i=1 ei participates in at most n possible edges; therefore there
are at most 2t · n α-long edges that interesect one of the ei’s. Hence, the probability that such a

13

Fix γ such that 2γ(1 + ε) < δ

Proof of Theorem 1.7. Let ε > 0 and let T ∼ T (n, 1+ε
n ). Let B, Bshort and Blong be deﬁned as in
Claim 6.2. Let R be the backedge graph of T (as deﬁned in Section 1.1), that is, the graph obtained
from B by forgetting the orientation of the edges. Then R ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε
n (cid:1). By Corollary 3.2, w.h.p. in
every 2-coloring of R there are δn monochromatic pairwise vertex-disjoint edges, where δ = Θ(ε3).
4 . We assume from now on that the assertions of Corollary 3.2
and of Claims 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 hold, and show that this implies that DistTour-BP(T ) ≥ ηn (where
η := η(ε)). All these events hold w.h.p. so they also hold simultaneously w.h.p. This will imply that
w.h.p. DistTour-BP(T ) ≥ ηn. We apply Claim 6.3 with β0 = γ.

Our goal is to show that for every bipartition V1 ⊎ V2 of T , one must reverse at least ηn edges
to make both parts transitive. Let V1 ⊎ V2 be some partition of V (T ) = [n]. We think of it as a
2-coloring of [n] with colors 1 and 2. By Corollary 3.2, there are δn monochromatic pairwise vertex-
disjoint backedges. WLG, at least δ
2 n of these edges are colored with color 1. By Claim 6.2 (for
α = γ) we have that |Bγ-short| ≤ 2γ(1 + ε)n < δ
4 n (where the last inequality follows from our choice
of γ). Hence there is a collection L1 of at least δ
4 n γ-long pairwise vertex-disjoint edges, with both
endpoints colored by 1.
Now let L2 be the set of all edges −→vu = e ∈ L1 for which there exists w ∈ V (T ) such that
u < w < v, −→uw ∈ E(T ), −→wv ∈ E(T ), and w is colored with color 1. We consider two complementary
cases.
2|L1|. By deﬁnition, every edge −→vu ∈ L2 lies in a monochromatic cyclic triangle,
Case I: |L2| ≥ 1
namely the triangle u → w → v → u. Denote the set of these triangles by T r. Then |T r| = |L2|.
Observe that each triangle in T r shares an edge with at most one other triangle in T r (this follows
from the fact that the edges in L2 are vertex-disjoint). Therefore, there is a subset T r1 ⊆ T r of size at
least |T r|
2 of pairwise edge-disjoint cyclic triangles. By assumption, the vertices of all triangles in T r1
are colored with 1. Clearly one needs to reverse one edge from each triangle in T r1 to make V1 (the
set of vertices with color 1) transitive. By the edge-disjointness of the triangles, one needs to reverse

Case II: |L2| < 1

of intervals: Jk = (cid:2)2kγn, 2k+1γn(cid:1) for 0 ≤ k ≤ ℓ− 1 and Jℓ = (cid:2)2ℓγn, n(cid:3). By the Pigeonhole Principle,
there is some k = 0, ..., ℓ such that at least |L1\L2|

Let us ﬁrst complete the proof of the theorem based on Claims 6.4 and 6.5, and then proceed to
prove these claims. Let e1, ..., et be the collection of edges from Claim 6.4. For every i = 1, ..., t, let
i=1 T r(ei). Then
the triangles in T r are pairwise edge-disjoint and monochromatic (this follows from Claim 6.5 and

of the triangles, one needs to reverse at least |T r| edges. So DistTour-BP(T ) ≥ |T r| = Ω(cid:16) ε3
Proof of Claim 6.4. We ﬁnd e1, ..., et greedily. Let e1 = −−→v1u1 ∈ L3 be the edge with the leftmost
left-end-point among all edges in L3. Put β = |Ie1|n . By the deﬁnition of L3 we have βn ≥ ρ−n ≥ γn,

and so we can apply Claim 6.3 to Ie1. By Item 2 in Claim 6.3 we have:

that Ie ∩ Ie1 6= ∅ (including e1 itself). Let e2 be the edge with the leftmost left-end-point among the

have the edges e1, ..., et. At each step we removed at most 8ρ2

Proof of Claim 6.5. Put β = |Ie|
6 . By the deﬁnition of L3 we have: β ≥ ρ− ≥ γ. By Item
1 in Claim 6.3, there is a collection Se of size |Se| ≥ cβ2n of α-long pairwise vertex-disjoint edges
inside Ie. Recall that by deﬁnition, every w ∈ Ie which satisﬁes −→uw,−→wv ∈ E(T ) is colored with color
2. Let Y be the set of all w ∈ Ie for which either −→wu ∈ E(T ) or −→vw ∈ E(T ). By Claim 6.1, the
degrees of u, v in R are at most 5 log n, and so |Y | ≤ 10 log n. Let BY be the set of edges in Se with
at least one endpoint in Y . Since the edges in Se are vertex disjoint, we get |BY | ≤ |Y | ≤ 10 log n.
Therefore L′ = Se \ BY satisﬁes |L′| ≥ 1
Let −→yx ∈ L′. Then x, y are colored with color 2 because x, y /∈ Y . We claim that there is a vertex
z ∈ [x, y] that is colored with color 2 and satisﬁes −→xz ∈ E(T ) and −→zy ∈ E(T ). To see this, notice that
|[x, y]| ≥ αn (because −→yx is α-long). All but at most |Y | ≤ 10 log n of the vertices z ∈ Ie are colored
with color 2. Moreover, the number of vertices z ∈ [x, y] that satisfy either −→zx ∈ E(T ) or −→yz ∈ E(T )
is at most dR(x) + dR(y) ≤ 10 log n (by Claim 6.1). So there are at least αn − 20 log n ≥ 1 vertices z
that satisfy our requirements. Fix one such z and consider the cyclic triangle x → z → y → x. Set
T r′ to be the collection of all these triangles, one for each edge −→yx ∈ L′. Observe that each triangle
in T r′ shares an edge with at most one other triangle in T r′ (this follows from the fact that the edges
in L′ are vertex-disjoint). Therefore, there is a subset T r(e) ⊆ T r′ of size at least |T r′|
of pairwise
edge-disjoint monochromatic cyclic triangles. Recall that |T r′| = |L′| and |L′| ≥ c

7 Proof of Theorem 1.8

We will use the following fact in the proof of Theorem 1.8.

Lemma 7.1. [Theorem 2 from [16]] The largest collection of edge-disjoint triangles in Kn is of size
at least n2

6 − n
3 .

Let k ≥ 3 and let C = C(k) to be chosen later. Let T ∼ T (n, C

n ). If T is k-corolable, then there
exists a transitive sub-tournament of size at least n
k . We will show that w.h.p. this is not the case.
Let T ′ be a ﬁxed sub-tournament on n0 = n
k vertices (keeping the order of the vertices of T ). By
Lemma 7.1, there is a set of size n2
in T ′ such that for
every i 6= j we have |{xi, yi, zi} ∩ {xj, yj, zj}| ≤ 1. If T ′ is transitive, then every triangle from S has
to be transitive. Moreover, the probability that a triangle on a vertex set {x, y, z} ∈ S is transitive
is 1 − (1 − p)2p − (1 − p)p2 ≤ 1 − 0.9C

7 of triples of vertices S = {{xi, yi, zi}}n2

n . Therefore,

Pr(T ′ is transitive) ≤ Pr(every triangle in S is transitive) ≤ (cid:18)1 −

Now, using the union bound, the probability that there exists a transitive sub-tournament of size

n0 is at most

(cid:18) n

0.9C

n (cid:19)|S|

n |S|/n0(cid:17)n/k
n )2n0/7(cid:17)n/k
k (cid:17)n/k

0.9C

.

Thus, if we set C = 8k log k (and thus p = 8k log k/n) we have that the probability that there

exists a transitive sub-tournament of size n0 is o(1) and therefore w.h.p. T is not k-colorable.

For the lower bound, we show that for every k ≥ 3, there exists a constant c := c(k) such that
if p ≤ c(k)
n , then for T ∼ T (n, p) w.h.p. χ(T ) ≤ k. Indeed, recall that R is the graph on the vertex
set [n] where for every i < j, ij ∈ E(R) if and only if −→ji ∈ T , then R ∼ G(n, p). Recall also that

if R is k-colorable then T is also k-colorable. Indeed, an independent set in R is transitive in T ,
It is known (see, e.g., [2]) that for every k, if
since all the edges in it go in the same direction.
c(k) < 2(k − 1) log(k − 1) then for p ≤ c(k)
n , R ∼ G(n, p) is w.h.p. k-corolable, and therefore T is also
w.h.p. k-colorable.

8 Concluding Remarks and Open Problems

In this paper we dealt with two seemingly unrelated topics: homomorphisms of sparse random
graphs and coloring properties of biased random tournaments. We attacked both problems using an
upper bound on the maximum cut in sparse random graphs. We improved on previous known upper
bounds and obtained a sharp upper bound for the latter problem. This was made possible by the
deep result of Ding, Lubetzky and Peres [15] about the typical structure of the giant component in
sparse random graphs.

Using the aforementioned result on MAXCUT, we immediately obtained a solution to a conjecture

ℓ(ε) with this property.

of Frieze and Pegden. The conjecture stated that w.h.p. the random graph G ∼ G(cid:0)n, 1+ε
n (cid:1) does not
have a homomorphism into a suﬃciently large odd cycle. We actually showed for ℓ = Θ(cid:0)ε−3(cid:1), there
is no homomorphism from a typical G(cid:0)n, 1+ε
n (cid:1) to C2ℓ+1. It would be interesting to ﬁnd the minimal
Regarding random tournaments, we investigated the typical chromatic number of T ∼ T (n, p)
(the biased p-random tournament) for p = Θ(cid:0) 1
n(cid:1). We showed that this chromatic number behaves
similarly to the typical chromatic number of G ∼ G(n, p) for the same values of p. In particular, if
k ≥ 3, then there is a threshold for k-colorability of order k log k
(and it would be nice to ﬁnd the exact
threshold function, i.e. to calculate the “right” multiplicative constant before k log k). On the other
hand, there is a coarse threshold for 2-colorability: if p = c
n for c < 1, then the probability of being
2-colorable is bounded away from 0 and 1; if p = c
n for c > 1 then a typical T (n, p) is not 2-colorable.
In fact, we proved something stronger: for p = 1+ε
n , a typical T ∼ T (n, p) has linear distance from
log(1/ε)(cid:17)n.
being 2-colorable. More precisely, we showed that this distance is DistTour-BP(T ) ≥ Ω(cid:16) ε3
On the other hand, DistTour-BP(T ) ≤ DistBP(R), where R is the backedge graph of T (see Section
1.1). We showed (see Theorem 1.1 and Remark 3.4) that the typical distance of R ∼ G(n, p) from
bipartiteness is Θ(ε3)n. Hence we have the upper bound DistTour-BP(T ) ≤ Θ(ε3)n.
It would be
interesting to close the gap between the lower and upper bounds for DistTour-BP(T ).
