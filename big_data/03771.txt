Abstract

In this paper, we prove that the “conformal collider bounds” originally proposed in [1]
hold for any unitary parity-preserving conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) with a unique stress
tensor in dimensions d ≥ 3. In particular this implies that the ratio of central charges
for a unitary 4d CFT lies in the interval 31
3 . For superconformal theories this is
further reduced to 3
2 . The proof relies only on CFT ﬁrst principles - in particular,
bootstrap methods - and thus constitutes the ﬁrst complete ﬁeld theory proof of these
bounds. We further elaborate on similar bounds for non-conserved currents and relate
them to results obtained recently from deep inelastic scattering.

Introduction

It is an extremely important open problem to understand the full set of constraints that
ultraviolet consistency places on the infrared behavior of quantum ﬁeld theories. Conformal
ﬁeld theories provide an exciting arena for probing this question, in part due to the existence of
powerful additional symmetry, the availability of experimental data in condensed matter and
statistical systems, and deep connections with quantum gravity through holography. The recent
striking success of the conformal bootstrap in isolating and solving the low-lying spectrum of
the 3d Ising model [2–5] gives us reason to think that such constraints may be even more
restrictive in d > 2 than previously thought.

One powerful example of such constraints was given in [1], where it was argued that the
coeﬃcients appearing in the three-point functions between currents and stress tensors, (cid:104)JJT(cid:105)
and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105), are bounded to a ﬁnite region of parameter space. These constraints are particularly
striking in superconformal ﬁeld theories where these coeﬃcients are often calculable. The basic
argument in [1] behind these bounds is that for any initial state the energy ﬂux measured at
inﬁnity integrated over time should be positive. In other words, calorimeters in a “conformal
collider experiment” should pick up positive energies. Notice that the positivity of the spectrum
of energy ﬂux operators was not proved in [1], but was only postulated.

These “conformal collider bounds” were originally conjectured in 4d, where even in non-
supersymmetric theories they place highly nontrivial bounds on the central charges a and
c appearing in the trace anomaly, while their generalizations to other dimensions was given
in [6, 7]. For example in 4d, for any CFT (with or without supersymmetry) the central charges
must lie in the region:

(1.1)

Since [1], it has been an open question whether these constraints are consequences of CFT
ﬁrst principles, such as unitarity, associativity of the operator algebra, and causality. Moreover
in [8] it was recently questioned whether there may exist consistent theories that violate these
constraints but satisfy a weaker set of conditions.

While a full proof of these bounds has not been available, signiﬁcant progress on this issue
has been made on a number of diﬀerent fronts. In [9, 10] it was argued that such constraints
follow from causality in holographic large N theories by using and extending preliminary results
in [11, 12].1 Also in [10], a CFT argument was presented by making assumptions on the
behavior of lightcone operator product expansions and unitarity bounds on non-local operators.
Furthermore, in [14] some suggestive (but incomplete) arguments were given that the bounds
were related to unitarity when the CFT is placed at ﬁnite temperature. More recently, the
bounds and some generalizations to non-conserved operators have been derived in the context
of deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in [15] after making the assumption that the DIS amplitude is
bounded by a certain power of the kinematical invariant given by limx→0 A(q2, x) < x−2. While
all these results are extremely interesting, it is important to stress that there was always some
important assumption made that went beyond basic CFT principles.

1For a very interesting discussion of the origins and consequences of these constraints in the language of bulk

AdS physics, see [13].

Another perspective comes from analytical studies of the bootstrap in the lightcone limit,
which reveal a direct relation between couplings of low-twist operators and the asymptotic
behavior of CFT spectra at large spin [16, 17], extended further in [18–28]. In particular, in [27]
analytic lightcone bootstrap arguments were given for correlation functions containing global
symmetry currents and the stress tensor, where a direct connection was found between the 3d
conformal collider bounds for (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) and negativity of the anomalous dimensions
of large spin double-twist operators.

Finally, another important development occurred in [29], where it was demonstrated that
CFT unitarity/reﬂection positivity implies both causality and sum rules leading to constraints
on the signs of products of OPE coeﬃcients. These constraints are closely related to the bound
on chaos [30, 31] as discussed in the context of CFT correlators in [32–35]. The argument
was made for scalar 4-point functions in [29] and was recently generalized to spinning 4-point
functions in [36]. In the latter work a set of constraints, somewhat weaker than the conformal
collider bounds, were derived for the coeﬃcients in (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) for CFTs in general
dimensions. The argument in [36] additionally assumed the absence of scalar operators in the
J × J and T × T OPEs with dimensions d

2 − 1 < ∆ < d − 2.

In the present work we will give a complete proof that the conformal collider bounds must
hold in any unitary, parity-preserving conformal ﬁeld theory with a unique stress energy tensor.
We combine the basic argument of [29] with the reﬁned understanding of positivity conditions
obtained from generalizing the lightcone bootstrap arguments of [27] to general dimensions.
We will additionally explain why the bounds hold even in the presence of light scalar operators.
Generalizing our argument to non-conserved operators, we reproduce the constraints obtained
in the context of deep inelastic scattering in [15]. Throughout, we assume the CFT preserves
parity and has a unique conserved, spin two operator, which is the stress tensor.

Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we give a brief sketch of our argument. In
section 3 we review the argument of [29] in the context of operators with spin. In sections 4
and 5 we give our argument for the conformal collider bounds as well as derivations of large
spin anomalous dimensions for CFTs in general dimensions.
In section 6 we describe the
generalization to 3-point functions between non-conserved spinning operators. Finally,
in
section 7 we summarize our results and discuss future directions. Details and extensions of
our computations are presented in appendices A, B, and C.

2 Overview

In this section, we start by providing a sketch of the derivation of the conformal collider bounds
on the coeﬃcients in (cid:104)J µJ νT ρσ(cid:105) in a unitary conformal ﬁeld theory. We will make our argument
for CFTs with a unique stress tensor and no conserved currents with spin (cid:96) > 2.2

In [29], it was demonstrated that very general bounds on the OPE coeﬃcients in unitary
CFTs can be derived from the analyticity of the 4-point function (cid:104)φ(0)O(z, ¯z)O(1)φ(∞)(cid:105). This
4-point function can be expanded in diﬀerent OPE channels. In the lightcone limit of ¯z → 1,
2It was shown in [37, 38] that the presence of higher spin symmetry forces (cid:104)J µJ νTρσ(cid:105) to saturate the conformal

collider bounds for unitary CFTs in d ≥ 3.

where we show the contribution from the identity operator and the stress tensor T in the t-
channel. Using analyticity, the t-channel coeﬃcients λOOT λφφT can be related to an integral
of Re(G(z, ¯z) − G(ze−2πi, ¯z)) over a domain where z, ¯z are real and positive. This integrand is
positive because reﬂection positivity implies ah,¯h ≥ 0. This leads to a bound on the t-channel
OPE coeﬃcients: λOOT λφφT ≥ 0.

We apply the same argument now to the 4-point function Gµν

J ≡ (cid:104)J µφφJ ν(cid:105) and derive
bounds on the coeﬃcients of (cid:104)J µJ νT ρσ(cid:105) which appear in the t-channel of this 4-point function.
There are two independent coeﬃcients CJ and λJJT , where CJ is the current central charge.
We move the 4 points to a common 2d plane with conformal transformations and use {+,−, t}
to represent the two lightcone directions on this plane and an arbitrary perpendicular direction.
(x± are related to the usual Cartesian coordinates of Euclidean space by x± = x1 ± ix0.)

We focus ﬁrst on (cid:104)J +φφJ +(cid:105). In the t-channel, the dominant contributions in the lightcone
limit come from the identity operator and the T−− component of the stress tensor. In the J +×φ
channels, only symmetric traceless tensors (STTs) contribute at leading order:

J (z, ¯z) ∼ −2 + λJ +J +T−−λφφT g++

Next, we focus on (cid:104)J tφφJ t(cid:105). We will show that in the J t × φ channel, two families of
operators contribute in the leading lightcone limit, the STTs and the mixed symmetry tensors
denoted as A, which have a pair of antisymmetrized indices while the rest of the indices are
symmetrized:

The same argument will apply, except here the power series coeﬃcients of Gtt
J are positive,
h,¯h ≥ 0. This implies λJ tJ tT−−λφφT ≥ 0 or λJ tJ tT−− ≤ 0. However this bound is not optimal,
att
which is expected since we have two analytic functions of z, ¯z on the right hand side and each
has a power series with positive coeﬃcients. Indeed, we can get a stronger bound by subtracting
Gtt
J,ST T (z, ¯z) from both sides of the crossing equation (2.4), leading to:

(2.6)

This bound is saturated in a theory of free bosons. Together with (2.3), we have obtained the
conformal collider bounds on (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) that imply energy ﬂux positivity.

The derivation of the conformal collider constraints for (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) from (cid:104)T φφT(cid:105) exactly mirrors
that of (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105). The main diﬀerence is that for d ≥ 4, (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) depends on three parameters and
we will need to consider three crossing relations, corresponding to (cid:104)T ++φφT ++(cid:105), (cid:104)T +3φφT +3(cid:105),
and (cid:104)(T 33 − T 44)φφ(T 33 − T 44)(cid:105). Due to extra degeneracies, (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) in d = 3 depends on two
parameters (assuming parity), so we will only need to consider the ﬁrst two equations. In both
cases we will re-derive the full conformal collider bounds.

In the remainder of the paper we will give the above argument in more detail.

3 Scalar Correlators

In this section we review the constraints obtained by analyzing the 4-point function of scalar
operators, following [29]:

G(z, ¯z) = (cid:104)φ(0)O(z, ¯z)O(1)φ(∞)(cid:105).

(3.1)
In the Euclidean region where ¯z = z∗, this 4-point function may only have singularities as
z → 0, 1,∞, as pairs of operators approach each other. They are generically branch points that
make the 4-point function multi-valued for independent complex z and ¯z. The ﬁrst sheet of
G(z, ¯z) embeds the Euclidean region. The second sheet, G(ze−2πi, ¯z), is obtained from the ﬁrst
sheet by taking z around the branch point at 0.

In this work, we will use the properties of this 4-point function in a very small region near

(z, ¯z) ∼ (1, 1). Following the notation of [29], let us deﬁne

(3.2)
(3.3)
where σ is complex with Im(σ) ≥ 0 and |σ| ≤ R, while η is real and satisﬁes 0 < η (cid:28) R (cid:28) 1.
On the σ plane, this is a small half disc above σ = 0 and we exclude the origin from it. We refer
to this as region D. We deﬁne the normalized 4-point functions on the ﬁrst and the second
sheet:

z = 1 + σ,
¯z = 1 + ησ,

Gη(σ) ≡ (cid:104)φ(0)O(z, ¯z)O(1)φ(∞)(cid:105)
(cid:98)Gη(σ) ≡ (cid:104)φ(0)O(ze−2πi, ¯z)O(1)φ(∞)(cid:105)

(cid:104)φ(0)φ(∞)(cid:105)(cid:104)O(z, ¯z)O(1)(cid:105) = (ησ2)∆OG(1 + σ, 1 + ησ),
(cid:104)φ(0)φ(∞)(cid:105)(cid:104)O(z, ¯z)O(1)(cid:105) = (ησ2)∆OG((1 + σ)e−2πi, 1 + ησ).

Figure 1: The region D is a small half disc on the complex σ plane above the origin (which is
excluded). Here 0 < η (cid:28) R (cid:28) 1.

We will show that both Gη(σ) and (cid:98)Gη(σ) are analytic in D and ﬁnite at σ = 0.

On the ﬁrst sheet, we can expand G(z, ¯z) in three diﬀerent OPE channels:

s-channel:

t-channel:

u-channel:

G(z, ¯z) = (z ¯z)− 1

2 (∆O+∆φ)(cid:88)

The positions of the singularities indicate that these expansions converge for |z| < 1, |1−z| < 1,
and |z| > 1 respectively. The analyticity of Gη(σ) in D is a direct consequence of the convergence
of the t-channel OPE expansion. In terms of σ and η, we have

where the sum runs over all operators appearing in the t-channel expansion, including descen-
dants. It is also obvious from this convergent expansion that Gη(0) = 1 is ﬁnite since unitarity
constrains ∆ to be positive.

Convergence of the t-channel expansion is not enough to guarantee analyticity on the second
sheet. This is because taking z → ze−2πi can have a nontrivial eﬀect on the t-channel sum. For
example, we can consider the sum in the lightcone limit with η → 0 and σ ﬁnite. The t-channel
expansion becomes

where λm = λOOOmλφφOm denotes the coeﬃcient of the contributions of minimal twist operators
Om. We have omitted higher order terms in η. The lightcone conformal block ˜g∆m,(cid:96)m(1 − z)
is regular on the ﬁrst sheet around z = 1, but develops singularities on the second sheet. For

7

R0σexample, the lightcone conformal block for the stress tensor in 4-dimensions is given by

˜g4,2(1 − z) = −15 [3(1 − z2) + (1 + 4z + z2) log(z)]

2(1 − z)2

.

(3.11)

It is easy to see that this function is regular as z → 1, but a pole emerges from the log term as
z → ze−2πi.

More generally, using the t-channel conformal blocks, (cid:98)Gη(σ) in the limit η (cid:28) |σ| (cid:28) 1 takes

the form

(cid:98)Gη(σ) = 1 − iˆλm

(3.13)

The appearance of singularities in the conformal blocks indicate that individual terms in the
t-channel sum may increase as we move to the second sheet. So convergence on the ﬁrst sheet
does not imply convergence on the second sheet. These singularities, however, do not indicate

that (cid:98)Gη(0) is divergent. In fact, when σ < η, similar contributions from the omitted terms in
We will show that (cid:98)Gη(σ) is analytic in D and (cid:98)Gη(0) is ﬁnite using positivity and convergence

of the s- and u-channel expansions. The 4-point function is reﬂection positive in the s-channel
and this implies that the expansion of the 4-point function around (z, ¯z) ∼ (0, 0) has positive
coeﬃcients:

G(z, ¯z) = (z ¯z)− 1

ah,¯hzh ¯z¯h,

ah,¯h ≥ 0.

(3.14)

This was shown in [29] by considering the following state in a radially quantized Hilbert space:

arbitrary f (r, θ) implies ah,¯h ≥ 0.

In fact, this positivity condition can be further reﬁned. Following [16], [39], and [40], we

|α(cid:105)(cid:104)α| and still have positivity:

(cid:104)f|O|f(cid:105) ≥ 0.

(3.16)

This implies that each partial wave contribution in the s-channel has positive coeﬃcients in its
z, ¯z expansion:

where the powers a, b are related to the scaling dimensions.

In the Euclidean region where ¯z = z∗, the s-channel expansion converges for |z| < 1. The
positivity of ah,¯h immediately implies that for independent complex numbers z, ¯z satisfying
|z|,|¯z| < 1, the sum still converges since

|G(ze−2πi, ¯z)| ≤ G(z, ¯z).

This in turn yields the inequality

σ ∈ [−R, 0).

In fact, using radial coordinates [41], the region of convergence for the s-channel expansion can
be expanded to the whole complex plane excluding [1, +∞). As detailed in [29], the bounds
the same argument in the u-channel implies analyticity in D/[−R, 0]. Combining these two

analogous to (3.18) in the radial coordinate implies that (cid:98)Gη(σ) is analytic in D/[0, R], while

4The branch cuts of G(z, ¯z) with respect to z are chosen in the following way. The ﬁrst branch cut originates
from z = 1 and lies in the lower half plane. The second branch cut originates from z = 0 and goes along the
negative real axis to connect to the branch point at z = ∞. There are no other branch cuts on the z plane. The
branch cuts on the ¯z plane are chosen in the same way.

5Note that we cannot choose (cid:96)m = 0, 1 here, otherwise the integral may not be well deﬁned.

where ˆλm ∝ λOOOmλφφOm. If Om is the stress tensor, then we have derived constraints on the
OPE coeﬃcients of (cid:104)φφT(cid:105) and (cid:104)OOT(cid:105) using reﬂection positivity. The condition we get here
is trivial and can also be obtained easily using the Ward identity. In future sections, we will
generalize this analysis to 4-point functions involving spinning operators, leading to nontrivial
constraints on (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105).

Here we would like to emphasize that scalar operators in the t-channel with dimension
2 < ∆ < d − 2 will not change the result. To see this we note that that the discontinuity of
d−2
the t-channel conformal block along the branch cut z ∈ (−∞, 0] is purely imaginary. Therefore
the integral (3.23), due to the Kronecker δ function in (3.22), serves as a projector onto blocks
of deﬁnite spin (cid:96)m.6 This projection is reminiscent of the simpliﬁed lightcone OPE structure
presented in [10], where the scalar contributions dropped out after integration.

As detailed in [29], one can show using (3.12) that a ﬁnite number of conserved higher spin

currents in the t-channel will contradict the analyticity of (cid:98)Gη(σ) in the region D. If there are
an inﬁnite number of higher spin currents the analytic structure of (cid:98)Gη(σ) can be changed so

(3.24) no longer applies. Therefore, among the possible conserved currents, (3.24) is only useful
for bounding the OPE coeﬃcients involving the stress tensor T .

It has been proven in d = 3 [37] and in d ≥ 4 [38] that in a unitary CFT with a ﬁnite central
charge and a unique stress tensor satisfying the cluster decomposition principle, the presence of
one conserved higher spin current forces the three point functions of the conserved operators to
coincide with a free ﬁeld theory expression. Specializing to our case, this means the conformal
collider bounds are saturated for (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105). Therefore, although our methods will not
apply if the theory contains higher spin currents, with our set of assumptions, the conformal
collider bounds also hold for CFTs with a higher spin symmetry.

Finally, one can consider how to derive constraints on the coupling to an exchanged non-
conserved higher spin operator. Exactly analogous to how one can isolate the stress tensor
block even in the presence of a light scalar, one can use (3.23) to isolate the contribution of a
higher spin operator and derive constraints on the relevant OPE coeﬃcients. In particular, for
each choice of spin, the operator with the smallest twist can be isolated. It would be interesting
to compare the constraints from reﬂection positivity to those derived recently in the context of
deep inelastic scattering [15], but we postpone this analysis to future work.

4 Bounds on (cid:104)JJT(cid:105)
the analyticity of (cid:98)Gη(σ) is ensured by reﬂection positivity and convergence of the s- and u-
channel OPEs. Using the t-channel spinning conformal blocks, we will compute (cid:98)Gη(σ) for

The above analysis carries over almost verbatim for the case of spinning operators. Again,
the t-channel OPE guarantees that the ﬁrst sheet correlator Gη(σ) is analytic in D, while

0 < η (cid:28) |σ| (cid:28) 1 and the result takes the same functional form as in (3.12). We can then use

6For d > 6, a ﬁnite number of subleading η orders in the conformal block for scalar exchange could also
dominate over the contribution from the stress tensor. But their σ dependence is the same as the leading order.
So they cannot be picked up in (3.22) either.

the contour integral of (cid:98)Gη(σ)−Gη(σ) along ∂D to relate these coeﬃcients to positive quantities.

We will see that this reproduces the conformal collider bounds.

In this section, we ﬁrst elucidate the structures of the three conformal block decompositions
of (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105) and explicitly work out the consequence of reﬂection positivity in the t- and s-
channel. We then demonstrate the extraction of the bounds by applying the contour argument
to (cid:104)J +φφJ +(cid:105) and (cid:104)J tφφJ t(cid:105).

4.1 Crossing Symmetry

Let us consider the correlator

J (z, ¯z) ≡ (cid:104)J µ(0)O(z, ¯z)O(1)J ν(∞)(cid:105).
Gµν

This 4-point function can be expanded in s-, t- and u-channel conformal blocks. In general,

where we have absorbed the tensor structures Qp into the conformal blocks, since in our
conﬁguration they will also become functions of z and ¯z. This will not be true for generic
conﬁgurations. J is a conserved current, so ∆J = d − 1. In the J × φ OPE there are in general
two families of operators, corresponding to symmetric traceless tensors ST T ≡ {O[(cid:96)], (cid:96) ≥ 0}
and mixed symmetry tensors A ≡ {O[(cid:96),1], (cid:96) ≥ 1}, where the latter has a pair of indices
antisymmetrized and the other ((cid:96) − 1) indices symmetrized.

The case d = 3 is special since all irreducible tensors are equivalent to symmetric traceless
tensors through the use of the  tensor. Since we assume that the theory preserves parity we
can still distinguish two families of operators by their parity. In this case we use the label ST T
for operators that are parity even and A for operators that are parity odd. In both d = 3 and
d ≥ 4, each class of operators has a unique tensor structure in the J × φ OPE.

11

In the J × J OPE, operators with spin can appear with two independent parity-preserving
JJO is

tensor structures, while scalars have a unique tensor structure. The index b on λb
introduced to account for the generic appearance of multiple 3-point function structures.

In the lightcone limit where ¯z → 1 and z is ﬁnite, the t-channel expansion is organized by
the twist ∆−(cid:96). The leading order contribution is given by the identity operator, which has twist
zero. The identity contribution has a power law singularity (1 − ¯z)−∆φ in the lightcone limit,
while each single conformal block in the s-channel contains at most a log(1 − ¯z) singularity.
Therefore, as established in [16], leading terms in the t-channel can only be reproduced via
In the present case,
inﬁnite sums over the spins of families of operators in the s-channel.
n,(cid:96) ∈ ST T , with the schematic form J µ1∂(µ2 . . . ∂µ(cid:96))∂2nφ, and
there are two such families: [Jφ][(cid:96)]
n,(cid:96) ∈ A, with the schematic form J [µ1∂(µ2]∂µ3 . . . ∂µ(cid:96))∂2nφ. As (cid:96) → ∞, the anomalous
[Jφ][(cid:96),1]
dimensions of these operators vanish as a power law in (cid:96) and their twists approach d−2+∆φ+2n
and d − 1 + ∆φ + 2n, respectively.

We will work with two polarizations of the 4-point function, G++

J . As demonstrated
0,(cid:96) contributes in
n,(cid:96) and

The next-to-leading order contribution in the t-channel comes from the stress tensor confor-
mal block, which will contain a log(z) term.8 It is this log(z) that eventually leads to the σ−1
enhancement of the correlator on the second sheet when we take z → ze−2πi. In the s-channel,
this term is reproduced via the anomalous dimensions of the large-spin double-twist operators.
The s-channel conformal blocks are proportional to z τ

does not change the result of our analysis. So to simplify the discussion we ignore their possible contributions.
We assume that the CFT we are considering has no higher spin symmetries.

4.2 Reﬂection Positivity

To elucidate the consequences of reﬂection positivity, we consider the following states in the
Hilbert space of radial quantization

r→∞ f (rˆx1) where ˆx1 is the unit vector pointing at the direction

2(x+ + x−). Note that the inversion tensor,
I µν(x) = ηµν − 2

xµxν
(4.9)
x2 ,
appears in the deﬁnition of (cid:104)f, ∗|, and in particular I−
+ (∞ˆx1) = −1, which will lead to some
additional signs compared to the scalar case. Namely, for µ pointing in the + or the t direction,
positivity (cid:104)f, ∗| f, (cid:105) ≥ 0 will imply that the power series coeﬃcients of −G++
J (z, ¯z)
will be positive semideﬁnite when expanded around (z, ¯z) ∼ (0, 0). Setting z = 1 + σ and
¯z = 1 + ησ, we deﬁne the following normalized correlation functions:

J (z, ¯z) or Gtt

J,η(σ) ≡ (ησ2)∆φGµν

J (1 + σ, 1 + ησ),
J ((1 + σ)e−2πi, 1 + ησ).

As in the scalar case, these positivity conditions lead to the analyticity of (cid:98)G++
J,η(σ) − (cid:98)Gtt

in region D as well as the positivity of −G++
line segment σ ∈ [−R, R].

We can sharpen these conditions by inserting the projector |O| into the norm. Since
(cid:104)f, ∗|α(cid:105)(cid:104)α|f, (cid:105) ≥ 0 for any state α in the conformal multiplet of O, we see that each conformal
block λJφOλφJOGµνO has negative coeﬃcients in the z, ¯z expansion if µ = ν = + and positive
coeﬃcients if µ = ν = t. Therefore, the analyticity and boundedness still holds on the second
sheet for this partial contribution to the 4-point function.

Finally, we note that the results in this subsection do not depend on taking the lightcone

limit. In particular, they hold when |σ| < η.

Comparing with the inequalities (4.15) and (4.18), this proves that in the large (cid:96) limit, the
symmetric traceless double-twist states [Jφ][(cid:96)]
0,(cid:96) and the mixed symmetry double-twist states
[Jφ][(cid:96),1]

0,(cid:96) have negative anomalous dimensions arising from the exchange of the stress tensor.
In fact, extending these formulas to all γ[Jφ][(cid:96)]

in the regime when (cid:96) (cid:29) n ≥ 0,
the anomalous dimensions are always proportional to the same linear combination of t-channel
OPE coeﬃcients. We have explicitly computed these anomalous dimensions in appendix B.
We ﬁnd that they are all negative semideﬁnite because of the conformal collider bounds. In
a quantum gravitational theory in AdS dual to a CFT, the double-twist states correspond
to two-particle bound states and the anomalous dimensions from T exchange correspond to
the gravitational binding energy between the particles. We have therefore proven that due to
unitarity and crossing symmetry of the CFT, gravity must be attractive in AdS between a
scalar particle and a gauge boson separated at super-horizon distances. Note that this result
does not rely on any large N limit.

The universal attractive character of gravity at long distances is precisely violated by Gauss-
Bonnet theories of AdS gravity with large higher derivative corrections. It was precisely this
fact that led originally to bounds on shear viscosity in [11, 12] which were later generalized
and reinterpreted in terms of conformal collider bounds in [1, 9, 10]. The argument above
establishes universal attractiveness of gravity as an inevitable consequence of the holographic
principle.

5 Bounds on (cid:104)T T T(cid:105)

In this section, we apply a similar argument to what was used in section 4 to a 4-point function
containing two scalars φ and two stress tensors T :

Gµνρσ

(z, ¯z) ≡ (cid:104)T µν(0)φ(z, ¯z)φ(1)T ρσ(∞)(cid:105).

T

(5.1)
We will show that the conformal collider bounds on the coeﬃcients in (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) follow from
crossing symmetry and reﬂection positivity. We will parametrize (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) in general dimensions
by CT , t2, and t4, where CT is the central charge which appears in the 2-point function of the
stress tensor. The relation between t2, t4 and the basis used in [42] is given in appendix C.

5.1 Crossing Symmetry

The 4-point function can be expanded in three diﬀerent OPE channels. The s- and t- channel
are:

(z, ¯z) = (z ¯z)− 1

2 (∆φ−∆T )(cid:88)
(z, ¯z) = [(1 − z)(1 − ¯z)]−∆φ(cid:88)

(1 − z, 1 − ¯z),

where ∆T = d. We’ve absorbed the tensor structures into the conformal blocks, since in our
conﬁguration they become functions of z and ¯z. The u-channel is similar to the s-channel but
we will not need it explicitly. In general d ≥ 4, there are three types of operators in the T × φ
OPE, each with a unique 3-point structure: symmetric traceless tensors ST T = {O[(cid:96)], (cid:96) ≥ 0},
tensors A = {O[(cid:96),1], (cid:96) ≥ 1} with a pair of indices antisymmetrized and the other ((cid:96) − 1) indices
symmetrized, and tensors B = {O[(cid:96),2], (cid:96) ≥ 2} two pairs of indices antisymmetrized and the
other ((cid:96) − 2) indices symmetrized.

When d = 3 we once again assume the theory preserves parity and use the label ST T for
operators of even parity and the label A for operators of odd parity. Finally, we use the index
b in (5.4) to take into account that operators with spin in the T × T OPE can in general have
three diﬀerent parity-preserving 3-point structures in d ≥ 4 and two in d = 3. Scalar operators
appear with a unique tensor structure in the T × T OPE.

Similar to what happened for (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105), we show in appendix A that at the leading order in

the lightcone limit, the s-channel expansion has the following structure:

Each of the bounds (5.9), (5.11), and (5.13) corresponds to a conformal collider bound in general
dimensions as can be seen by comparing with [6, 54]. Furthermore, in d = 3, due to the extra
degeneracy in tensor structures t2 = 0, and the third bound becomes equivalent to the second.
Alternatively one can work in d = 3 directly and use the ﬁrst two crossing equation to rederive
the d = 3 collider bounds.
In ﬁgure 2 we illustrate the bounds in t2, t4 in a few diﬀerent
dimensions.

These bounds are also strengthened in the presence of SUSY. In a 4d N = 1 SCFT we have

which yields a stronger lower bound than what we obtained from applying the (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) bound
to U (1)R currents, as pointed out earlier.

In a 4d N = 2 SCFTs the lower bound is identical to the one in (4.21) but the upper bound
is weaker [10], so there are no new constraints from (cid:104)T T T(cid:105). These bounds are also trivially
satisﬁed in a 4d N = 4 SCFT where a = c.

5.5 Anomalous Dimensions

In the lightcone limit, the t-channel sum is dominated by the large spin double-twist operators.
The large spin ST T operators have the following schematic form: [T φ][(cid:96)]
n,(cid:96) = T µ1µ2∂(µ3 . . . ∂µ(cid:96))∂2nφ.
The large spin A operators [T φ][(cid:96),1]
n,(cid:96) has one index on T antisymmetrized with a ∂µ, while the
large spin B operators [T φ][(cid:96),2]
n,(cid:96) have both indices on T antisymmetrized with ∂µ’s. We will now
show that the large (cid:96) anomalous dimension asymptotics for [T φ][(cid:96)]
0,(cid:96) are
negative.

Because of (5.9), (5.11), (5.13), and λφφT < 0 due to the Ward identity, these anomalous
dimensions are negative. We ﬁnd that this behavior also extends to n > 0 in the (cid:96) (cid:29) n limit
(see appendix B). For a quantum gravity theory in AdS dual to a unitary CFT, we have proven
that gravity must be attractive in AdS between a scalar particle and a graviton separated by
super-horizon distances. Once again, this result does not make any assumption about being in
a large N limit.

6 Non-Conserved Currents

We will now generalize the above discussion to external non-conserved operators. In particular
V (z, ¯z) = (cid:104)V µ(0)φ(z, ¯z)φ(1)V ν(∞)(cid:105) where
we will be interested in the correlation function Gµν
V µ is a generic vector with dimension ∆V > d − 1 and φ is a scalar of arbitrary dimension. In
[15] it was observed that the bounds derived via deep inelastic scattering (DIS) are weaker than
the bounds derived from positivity of the energy one point function (cid:104)E((cid:126)n)(cid:105). Here we will ﬁnd
that the bounds we obtain from reﬂection positivity and crossing symmetry for this correlation
function coincide with the results of the DIS argument.

The general 3-point function (cid:104)V φO(cid:105), where O is a symmetric traceless tensor primary, using

the formalism of [55, 56], takes the form

(6.1)

When O is in the [(cid:96), 1] representation of SO(d) for d ≥ 4, or a parity odd operator in d = 3,
the 3-point function (cid:104)V φO(cid:105) is uniquely determined up to a single overall OPE coeﬃcient. The
corresponding conformal block is the same as when V is a conserved current and is written in
appendix A.1.1

Matching the identity block in the t-channel we ﬁnd that the double-twist operators [V φ][(cid:96)]
n,(cid:96)
and [V φ][(cid:96),1]
n,(cid:96) with twist τV + ∆φ + 2n and τV + 1 + ∆φ + 2n, respectively, must be present in the
regime (cid:96) (cid:29) n. Moreover the eﬀect of the b1 term is necessarily subleading at small (1 − ¯z). We
then deﬁne the OPE coeﬃcient λV φ[V φ][(cid:96)]
to be equal to b2. We will also canonically normalize
the 2-point function as

n,(cid:96)

(cid:104)V µ(x)V ν(0)(cid:105) =

I µν(x)

(6.2)

Once again, we ﬁnd that in reproducing the divergences in the t-channel, the ST T operators
will contribute to both the ++ crossing equation and the tt crossing equation, while the [(cid:96), 1]
operators will only contribute to the tt equation. The ratio between the ST T contribution in
the tt polarization and the ++ polarization is −1

e2 = −2a2 − a3,

e3 = a1 − 2(d/2 − 1)a2 + a3(1 − d),

where the Ward identity additionally imposes the condition

a1 = −(∆V − d + 1)(a2 + a3).

(6.5)

Similar to the case of conserved vectors, we will be interested in the following two functions:

7 Discussion

In this work, we have proven that the “conformal collider bounds” originally proposed in [1]
hold for any unitary parity-preserving conformal ﬁeld theory (CFT) with a unique stress tensor
in dimensions d ≥ 3. This presents the ﬁrst complete ﬁeld theory proof of the “conformal
collider bounds” conjectured in [1]. While there was a large amount of evidence suggesting the
result was indeed correct, as reviewed in the introduction, until now it had remained remarkably
diﬃcult to obtain a full proof purely based on unitarity, conformal symmetry, and quantum ﬁeld
theory axioms. Due to the ubiquitous relevance of the energy momentum and current 3-point
functions and their relation to anomalies, it is reassuring to ﬁnd that the basic principles of
conformal ﬁeld theory imply these constraints.

Our result also shows the power of the bootstrap methods, ﬁrst championed by [57–59]
and revived more recently in [60]. In its strongest form, unitarity and crossing symmetry may
contain all necessary information to classify the whole landscape of conformal ﬁeld theories
without any extra input. Numerical results in recent years certainly point in this direction (e.g.
[2–5, 61–72]). If it is possible to deﬁne all CFTs through the bootstrap method, it would be a
signiﬁcant step forward in the understanding of strongly coupled quantum ﬁeld theory as they
are connected to CFTs by renormalization group ﬂows. This work adds to the list of positive
results by tackling a problem that had resisted attacks from other methods.

In parallel to the numerical approach, there is an important line of research that uses
analytic methods to explore the consequences of the crossing symmetry [16–28]. This approach
has opened up regimes of the CFT data that are diﬃcult to probe numerically, but which
have clear and crucial relevance to quantum gravitational theories in AdS. For example, AdS

23

observables such as binding energies [16, 17, 25, 27] and Eikonal phases [73–75] are directly
related to the anomalous dimensions of classes of CFT operators with large dimensions and
large spin, which are more accessible with the analytic bootstrap methods.

More generally, once we understand CFTs, we can use them as starting points to answer
important questions in quantum gravity. An especially exciting question is the quantum
origin of universal features of gravitational interactions, such as causality, (non-)locality and
attractiveness [16–18, 32, 76–78]. The bounds proved in this paper are directly related to
properties of 3-particle vertices in the bulk, including at least one graviton [1]. These bounds
also imply that the gravitational interaction is attractive between two particles separated by
super-horizon distances in AdS, as a direct consequence of the unitarity of the underlying
quantum theory. It would be interesting to apply the bootstrap method to other questions in
quantum gravity, for instance: ﬁnding all CFTs dual to approximate Einstein gravity in AdS,
where a = c. It was shown in [13] using bulk causality that | a−c
related to the dimension of the lightest higher spin single particle operator. Establishing this
result within the CFT would be a solid step towards understanding the most general UV
completions of Einstein gravity in AdS.

c | satisﬁes a bound directly

Another important direction is to prove a much stronger positive energy condition from
CFT principles. It is possible that unitarity and consistency require the energy ﬂux operators
constructed in [1] to have only positive semi-deﬁnite eigenvalues, so they acquire positive
expectation values in any state, not just the ones created by conserved local operators. This
result is not only important theoretically, but is also relevant in experimental setups where
energy correlation functions are used because of their IR ﬁniteness properties. The obvious
ﬁrst step is to understand the conformal collider bounds involving non-conserved currents.
The results in section 6, being the same as the corresponding bounds obtained from the Deep
Inelastic Scattering approach in [15], are weaker than the conformal collider bounds and still
allow for negative energy ﬂux.
It would be interesting to see whether the full energy ﬂux
positivity conditions can be derived by considering more complicated 4-point functions.

In this work we have assumed that the stress tensor is the unique conserved, spin-2 operator.
One may ask what happens if there are many such operators in the spectrum. If the theory is a
product of CFTs, each with a unique stress tensor, then our arguments will go through for each
sector of the theory.11 In general, the number of conserved, spin-2 operators does not necessarily
correspond to the number of mutually decoupled sectors in the theory [37]. Another simple
example is a CFT with non-Abelian global symmetries. The current OPE J a × J b may contain
diﬀerent conserved spin-2 currents in diﬀerent representations. However, as long as the stress
tensor is the unique singlet spin-2 conserved current, our argument applies after projecting this
OPE to the singlet sector. In more general cases, direct application of our method leads to
bounds on certain linear combinations of OPE coeﬃcients involving multiple spin-2 conserved
currents. It is interesting to see whether there is a method that selects the stress tensor from
this group, leading to the conformal collider bounds for generic CFTs with multiple spin-2
conserved currents.

Last but not least, eﬀorts in the modern conformal bootstrap program have largely focused

11The result of [37, 38] also holds for each sector and the conformal collider bounds are satisﬁed where there

is higher spin symmetry in a subset of the decoupled sectors.

on the 4-point function of scalar operators. This is primarily due to limited knowledge of
spinning conformal blocks. However, it was already demonstrated in [27, 36, 69] and this
work that the crossing symmetry of 4-point functions involving spinning operators harbors rich
information inaccessible from scalar 4-point functions. Fortunately, much progress has taken
place in the last year on spinning conformal blocks. For example, the work in [27, 40, 55, 56,
79, 80] was of crucial importance to develop the results in this paper. Other important progress
on spinning blocks includes [81–83]. These results are extremely valuable and could lead to
new breakthroughs for the bootstrap, both on the numerical and analytical front. Extending
these ideas to include the energy-momentum tensor would also open up new opportunities to
understand universal physics in CFTs and the bulk properties of their holographic duals.

A Spinning Conformal Blocks at Large Spin

In this appendix we derive the relevant s-channel spinning conformal blocks in the lightcone
limit. We ﬁnd that they can be written as (derivatives of) a single scalar conformal block. This
simpliﬁcation occurs because the sum over spins in the s-channel is performed via

so that terms with higher powers in 1/(cid:96) result in subleading terms in (1 − ¯z), for (1 − ¯z) (cid:28) 1
and (cid:96) (cid:29) 1 with (1 − ¯z)(cid:96)2 (cid:46) 1. Therefore the idea is to count the relative powers of 1/(cid:96), where
(1 − ¯z) has a weight of O(1/(cid:96)2).

Our strategy will be to write the conformal blocks as diﬀerential operators acting on a
basic set of ‘seed’ blocks, following the general approach developed in [56, 69, 79–83]. For the
seed blocks we expect, motivated by the results in [79], that they can be written as gseed ∼
gscalar + (. . . ), where the term (. . . ) includes ST T conformal blocks of higher-spin correlators
(see for example Eq. (4.87) in that paper). Moreover one can check, using the results of [56],
that the spinning blocks in (. . . ) are sub-leading in 1/(cid:96) with respect to gscalar.12 For blocks that

12The diﬀerential operators are constructed in such a way that the spin is increased while maintaining the
dimensions of the original three-point function. Thus there are no relative powers of (1 − ¯z) coming from
the diﬀerence in external dimensions (see (A.16)). The sub-leading powers of (cid:96) then come from the matrix
transforming the diﬀerential basis to the standard one.

can be derived from seed blocks, the simpliﬁcations can be inferred by looking at the diﬀerential
operators of [56] when acting on seeds.

The projection of these results into diﬀerent polarizations gives an explicit check of the
the triangular structure (5.5) for ﬁnite z. Furthermore, contributions from each irreducible
representation are related by a z-independent factor, at each order in (1 − ¯z).

A.1 Seed Blocks

First we look at the seed conformal blocks for the [(cid:96), 1] and [(cid:96), 2] representations that appear
in (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105) and (cid:104)T φφT(cid:105) respectively.

Notice that the simpliﬁcation for [(cid:96), 1] can be easily obtained by taking the ¯z → 1, (1−¯z)(cid:96)2 (cid:46)
1 limit in the expressions for gA given in (4.87)–(4.91) of [79]. Nonetheless we include this
calculation given that the logic is the same as for the [(cid:96), 2] blocks, where the explicit expressions
are not known yet.

A.1.1 [(cid:96), 1] Seed
The integral representation of the [(cid:96), 1] conformal block in (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105) is given by

Here k and m are given in (A.3) and (A.4) of [79] respectively, ˜A is a shadow operator, and the
integral has an implicit monodromy projection (as discussed in [40]). Using the results of [84]
we can write this tensor as

(A.5)
Notice that derivatives acting on P [(cid:96)] are structures that appear in ST T spinning blocks, and
thus sub-leading with respect to scalar blocks. Therefore keeping only the ﬁrst term in (A.4)
leads to a single scalar block times a tensor structure,

A.2 Derived Blocks

Now we turn to the conformal blocks that can be obtained from seeds, by acting with the
diﬀerential operators Dij of [56].13 The ST T exchange in both (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105) and (cid:104)T φφT(cid:105) can be
computed from the lightcone approximation to the scalar block [16]

This limit holds for even d ≥ 2 as long as the sum over (cid:96) only receives contributions in the
region where the product (cid:96)2(1− ¯z) is kept ﬁxed. For the [(cid:96), 1] exchange in (cid:104)T φφT(cid:105) the procedure
is completely analogous given that its seed is also a scalar conformal block, as shown in (A.8).
In both cases one can analyze the diﬀerential operators and drop derivatives as well as powers
of (cid:96) and (1 − ¯z) that produce subleading terms. The results are summarized below.

B Anomalous Dimensions for Non-Zero n

In this appendix we generalize our results for anomalous dimensions to n > 0 in the regime
(cid:96) (cid:29) n.

B.1 (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105)

In order to match the identity at all orders in z, we use the summation formula

(1 − x)b =

xn(b)n(c)n

n!(b + c + n − 1)n

2F1(b + n, b + n; b + c + 2n; x)

n = 0 result:

Now we split the anomalous dimensions as

(B.11)

Notice that for [(cid:96)] and [(cid:96), 1], the n-dependence is the same as in (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105). Finally, we deﬁne
anomalous dimensions for n ≥ 0 as

C Correlation Functions of Conserved Operators

In this appendix we will provide more details on the 3-point functions (cid:104)JJJ(cid:105) and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105).

C.1 Tensor Structures

We follow the notation and techniques of [55, 56]. See also [27] for more details on the diﬀerential
representation on the 3-point functions.

We start by lifting the points xµ and polarizations µ in Rd−1,1 to vectors P µ and Z µ,
respectively, in Rd,2. This lifting allows us to linearize the action of the conformal group. The
projection from embedding space to the Poincar´e section is explicitly given by,

Px = (P +, P −, Pµ) = (1, x2, xµ),

Z = (0, 2x · , µ)

(C.1)

33

The metric on the embedding space is given by P · P = −P +P − + δabP aP b. The basic buildings
blocks are given by
Hij = −2[(Zi · Zj)(Pi · Pj − (Zi · Pj)(Zj · Pi))],

(Zi · Pj)(Pi · Pk) − (Zi · Pk)(Pi · Pj)

Vi,jk =

.

Pj · Pk

(C.2)

We will use the shorthand V1 = V1,23, V2 = V2,31, and V3 = V3,1,2.

C.2 (cid:104)JJT(cid:105)

We will normalize the operators as follows:

(cid:104)J(P1, Z1)J(P2, Z2)(cid:105) = CJ

H12
P d
12

,

(cid:104)T (P1, Z1)T (P2, Z2)(cid:105) = CT

H 2
12
P d+2

.

(C.3)

The general form of the (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) 3-point function, after imposing symmetry under 1 ↔ 2, is

given by
(cid:104)J(P1; Z1)J(P2; Z2)T (P3; Z3)(cid:105) =

The relation between our basis and that used in [42], see Eqs. (3.11-3.14) is given by14

(C.5)

They also found that the Ward identity for the stress energy tensor implies

2Sd(˜c + ˜e) = dCJ .

(C.6)
. So (cid:104)JJT(cid:105) is ﬁxed up to
Where Sd is the volume of a (d − 1)-dimensional sphere, Sd = 2π
one OPE coeﬃcient, ˜c, and CJ . We labeled the parameter ˜c as λJJT in the body of the paper,
following the conventions of [27]. In the rest of this appendix we will also adopt this convention.
To construct the conformal block corresponding to T µν exchange in the s-channel of (cid:104)JJφφ(cid:105)
we apply the following diﬀerential operator on the scalar partial wave,

(cid:20)(cid:18)

(cid:19)

(cid:19)

14We add tildes to the variables to avoid confusion between these variables, the conformal anomalies a and c,

and the (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) OPE coeﬃcients.

34

The conformal block for T µν exchange in the t-channel of (cid:104)JφφJ(cid:105) is then found by letting 2 ↔ 4
everywhere in the resulting expression.

Finally, in [1] the parameter a2 was introduced, distinct from the a2 OPE coeﬃcient used

in (cid:104)V V T(cid:105), which gives the energy distribution for a state created by a conserved current:

(cid:18)

d − 1

(cid:104)E(n)(cid:105)·j =

(C.8)

where θ is the angle between the spatial polarization i and the point on Sd−1 labelled by ni.
Requiring that the energy one point function be positive yields the bounds

− d − 1
d − 2

≤ a2 ≤ d − 1.

(C.9)

The upper bound is saturated in a theory of free bosons and the lower bound is saturated in a
theory of free fermions. The relation between λJJT and a2 is given by

λJJT = −CJ (d − 2)dπ− d

C.3 (cid:104)T T T(cid:105)
In this section we will review the connection between the parametrization of (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) in terms
of the variables ˆc, ˆe, and CT as deﬁned in [42], the t2, t4, CT parametrization used in studies of
the energy one point function [6], and the free ﬁeld theory results.

We start by deﬁning the following basis of parity-even tensor structures for (cid:104)T T T(cid:105),

In [42] they parametrized the correlation function in general dimensions in terms of 8
variables: ˆa, ˆb, ˆb(cid:48), ˆc, ˆc(cid:48), ˆe, ˆe(cid:48), and ˆf . Labeling the coeﬃcients of Qi by xi, the relation between
the bases is given by

x1 = 8(ˆc + ˆe) + ˆf ,

x4 = −8ˆb(cid:48),

x2 = −4(4ˆb(cid:48) + ˆe(cid:48)),
x5 = 8ˆb + 16ˆa,

x7 = 2ˆc(cid:48),

x3 = 4(2ˆc + ˆe),
x6 = 2ˆc,
x8 = 8ˆa.

which is consistent with the conservation constraints of [42]. Finally, they found that solving
the Ward identity yields

x6 = x7,

(d − 2)(d + 3)ˆa − 2ˆb − (d + 1)ˆc

(C.24)
In d > 3 dimensions we can parametrize the parity-even structures in (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) by ˆc, ˆe, and CT ,
while in d = 3 the H12H13H23 structure is not linearly independent and (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) is ﬁxed up to
two parameters, 2ˆa − ˆc and CT .

d(d + 2)

= CT .

The relation between this basis and the t2 and t4 basis is given by

2 Γ(cid:0) d
2 + 2(cid:1) [(d (−3d2 + d + 2) + 4) t4 + (d + 1) (2d4 − d3(t2 + 4) + d2 + d + 3t2)]

Finally, as noted in [6], in even dimensions we can parametrize (cid:104)T T T(cid:105) by its expressions in

free ﬁeld theories of conformally coupled scalars, fermions, and ( d

2 − 1)-forms:

(cid:104)T T T(cid:105) = ns(cid:104)T T T(cid:105)s + nf(cid:104)T T T(cid:105)f + nt(cid:104)T T T(cid:105)t,

(C.27)

where ns, nf , and nt give the eﬀective number of real scalars, Dirac fermions, and ( d
forms, although there may not necessarily be any connection to the actual ﬁeld content. The
conformal collider constraints can then be written as [6, 54],

sidering (cid:104)T ++φφT ++(cid:105), (cid:104)T +3φφT +3(cid:105), and (cid:104)(T 33 − T 44)φφ(T 33 − T 44)(cid:105), respectively.
In three
dimensions t2 = 0 and the second and third constraints are redundant. Finally in four
dimensions we have [1, 42]

a

2ns + 124nt + 22nf

(C.31)

where nt now counts the number of real free vectors, a is the Euler anomaly, and c is related
to central charge CT as c = π4
