THE LOWER RANK OF DIRECT PRODUCTS OF

HEREDITARILY JUST INFINITE GROUPS

BENJAMIN KLOPSCH AND MATTEO VANNACCI

Qn

Abstract. We prove, in particular, that the direct product G =
i=1 Gi of ﬁnitely many pairwise non-commensurable hereditar-
ily just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups of ﬁnite lower rank has lower
rank lr(G) = max{lr(Gi) | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

1. Introduction

For any prime p, the theory of p-adic analytic pro-p groups plays
a central part in the study of pro-p groups and has interesting ap-
plications in inﬁnite group theory; see [6, 2]. A well-known algebraic
characterisations of p-adic analytic groups states: a pro-p group G is
p-adic analytic if and only if G has an open subgroup of ﬁnite rank.
Here the rank of G is deﬁned as

rk(G) = sup{d(H) | H ≤o G},

where d(H) denotes the minimal number of topological generators of
an open subgroup H ≤o G.
Indeed, Lubotzky and Mann [7] even
established the following reﬁnement: a pro-p group G is p-adic analytic
if and only if Ld(G) = lim sup{d(H) | H ≤o G} is ﬁnite, in which case
Ld(G) is equal to the dimension dim(G) of G as a p-adic manifold.
Lubotzky and Mann also introduced, for a general proﬁnite group G
the lower rank

lr(G) = Ld(G) = lim inf{d(H) | H ≤o G}.

They proved that the lower rank of a compact p-adic analytic group co-
incides with the number of generators of its associated Qp-Lie algebra.
By a classical theorem of Kuranishi [5], this implies that the lower rank
of any compact p-adic analytic group with semi-simple Qp-Lie algebra
is equal to 2.

Lubotzky and Shalev [8] continued the study of the lower rank and
showed, for instance, that there exist non-analytic pro-p groups of ﬁ-
nite lower rank. Reﬁning their techniques, Barnea [1] established, for
instance, that the lower rank of the Fp[[t]]-analytic group SL2(Fp[[t]]) is
equal to 2. On the other hand, Ershov and Jaikin proved that there

exist hereditarily just inﬁnite pro-p groups of inﬁnite lower rank; see [3,
Corollary 8.10]. More recently, the second author of the present paper
analysed the lower rank in a family of non-(virtually pro-p) hereditar-
ily just inﬁnite groups and conjectured that there exist such groups
of any given lower rank in N≥2 ∪ {∞}; see [9]. Computing the lower
ranks of proﬁnite groups is usually rather challenging and producing
new families of groups of ﬁnite lower rank is of considerable interest.

In this paper we are interested in the lower ranks of ﬁnite direct
products of hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups. We recall that a
proﬁnite group G is just inﬁnite if G is inﬁnite and every non-trivial
closed normal subgroup N Ec G is open in G. The group G is heredi-
tarily just inﬁnite if every open subgroup H ≤o G is just inﬁnite.

Theorem A. Let G = Qn
neighbourhood Qn

i=1 Gi be a ﬁnite direct product of ﬁnitely
many hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups of ﬁnite lower rank. Set
d = max{lr(Gi) | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Suppose that for every basic open
i=1 Ui of the identity element in G, with Ui ⊆o Gi,

there exist open subgroups Hi ≤o Gi, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, such that

(1) Hi ⊆ Ui and d(Hi) ≤ d for 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
(2) Hi 6∼= Hj for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n.

Then the lower rank of G is lr(G) = d.

Corollary B. The direct product G = Qn

i=1 Gi of ﬁnitely many pair-
wise non-commensurable hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups of
ﬁnite lower rank has lower rank lr(G) = max{lr(Gi) | 1 ≤ i ≤ n}.

Theorem A can be regarded as a generalisation the aforementioned
result, due to Kuranishi, Lubotzky and Mann, that compact p-adic
analytic groups with semi-simple Qp-Lie algebras have constant lower
rank 2. Furthermore, one should contrast our theorem with the fact
that, in general, the lower rank of a direct product of proﬁnite groups
can be as large as the sum of the lower ranks of the factors. For
instance, the lower rank of a free abelian pro-p group Z n
p is clearly
lr(Z n

p ) = n. Theorem A also highlights the following question.

Problem. Let G be a hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite group of ﬁnite
lower rank d that is not virtually abelian. Does G contain a neighbour-
hood base of the identity element consisting of pairwise non-isomorphic
d-generated open subgroups?

For p-adic analytic groups the answer is known to be positive; see
[4, Chapter III]. If the answer was yes more generally, this would lead
to a strengthening of our theorem.

Finally, we remark that Theorem A can be applied to the family of
hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups of ﬁnite lower rank described
in [9]. In this way we obtain many new examples of proﬁnite groups of
ﬁnite lower rank.

2. Preliminaries

Clearly, proﬁnite groups of ﬁnite lower rank are ﬁnitely generated
and thus countably based. Restricting to the latter class of proﬁnite
groups, we can avoid using the general notion of the limes inferior of a
net. The lower rank of a countably based proﬁnite group G is

lr(G) = minn sup(cid:8) inf{d(Hi) | i ≥ N} | N ∈ N(cid:9) | (Hi)i∈N ∈ C(G)o

∈ N0 ∪ {∞},

where

C(G) = n(Hi)i∈N | G = H1 o≥ H2 o≥ . . . and \i∈N

Hi = 1o

is the collection of all descending chains of open subgroups of G that
form a neighbourhood base for the identity element.

In other words, a countably based proﬁnite group G has lower rank at
most r if there exists a descending chain of r-generated open subgroups
of G that form a neighbourhood base for the identity.

In preparation for the proof of Theorem A we collect two basic lem-
mata. Recall that a (topological) group G is said to possess virtually
a property ℘ if G has a ﬁnite-index (open) subgroup H that has ℘.

Lemma 2.1. Let G be a virtually-abelian hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁ-
nite group. Then there exists a prime p such that G is virtually-Zp.

Proof. Let A be an open abelian subgroup of G. As A is just inﬁnite
it is a pro-p group for some prime p and inﬁnite pro-cyclic. Thus A is
isomorphic to Zp.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.2. Let H be a hereditarily just inﬁnite proﬁnite group that
is not virtually abelian, and let L ≤o H. Then there exists x ∈ H such
that L is not contained in CH (x).

Proof. For a contradiction, assume that L ⊆ CH (x) for all x ∈ H.
Then L is contained in the centre Z(H) = 1, hence L = 1.
(cid:3)

3. Proof of Theorem A

Let G = Qn
of Theorem A are satisﬁed. Let U = Qn

i=1 Gi be a direct product of ﬁnitely many hereditarily
just inﬁnite proﬁnite groups of ﬁnite lower rank. Set d = max{lr(Gi) |
1 ≤ i ≤ n}, and suppose that conditions (1) and (2) in the statement
i=1 Ui be a basic open neigh-
bourhood of the identity element in G, with Ui ⊆o Gi. We need to ﬁnd
a d-generated open subgroup K ≤o G with K ⊆ U.

Without loss of generality, the ﬁrst m factors G1, . . . , Gm are not vir-
tually abelian, while the remaining n−m factors Gm+1, . . . , Gn are vir-
tually abelian. By Lemma 2.1, there exists, for each i ∈ {m+1, . . . , n},
a prime pi such that Gi is virtually-Zpi. By virtue of hypothesis (2),

these primes are distinct. Consequently, Qn
cyclic. Descending to an open subgroup C ≤o Qn
arrange that C = hyi is pro-cyclic and C ⊆ Qn
in the group Qm

i=1 Gi × C ≤o G.

i=m+1 Gi is virtually pro-
i=m+1 Gi, we can
i=m+1 Ui. We now work

For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, we choose subgroups Hi ≤o Gi, with generators

hi1, . . . , hid, such that

Hi = hhi1, . . . , hidi ⊆ Ui

and

Hi 6∼= Hj

for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m.

We write H = Qm

i=1 Hi for the internal direct product of H1, . . . , Hn.
Observe that it suﬃces to produce a d-generated open subgroup K ≤o
H × C ≤o G. We consider

K = hg1, g2, . . . , gdi ≤c H1 × · · · × Hm × C = H × C,

where

g1 = h11h21 · · · hm1y

and

gi = h1ih2i · · · hmi

for 2 ≤ i ≤ d.

Clearly, K is d-generated. We claim that K is open in H × C.

For j ∈ {1, . . . , m}, let πj : H × C → Hj denote the projection onto
Hj and let πC : H ×C → C denote the projection onto C. For later use,
we observe that K is a sub-direct product of the groups H1, . . . , Hm, C,
i.e., πj(K) = Hj for all j ∈ {1, . . . , m} and πC(K) = C.

We claim that it is suﬃcient to show that, for each j ∈ {1, . . . , m},
there exist an open subgroup Kj ≤o Hj with Kj ≤ K. For then we

h = h N

11h N

get eK = K1 × · · · × Km ≤o H, and with N = |H : eK| we obtain
1 h−1 ∈ K.
Now C = hyi implies that eK ×hyN i ≤o H ×C, and hence K ≤o H ×C.

m1 = (h11h21 · · · hm1)N ∈ eK so that yN = g N

It remains to construct the aforementioned subgroups Kj ≤o Hj with

21 · · · h N

Kj ≤ K. By symmetry, it is enough to manufacture K1.

Recursively we construct, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ m, a subgroup K (i) ≤c K

such that

K (i) ≤ H1 × Hi+1 × Hi+2 × · · · × Hm

and

π1(K (i)) ≤o H1.

Then we can take K (m) for K1, and the proof is complete.

Clearly, we can set K (1) = K. Now suppose i ∈ {2, . . . , m} such
that K (i−1) is already available and build K (i) as follows. Let F = Fd
denote the free proﬁnite group on d generators a1, . . . , ad and deﬁne
proﬁnite presentations

1 → Ri → F

ϕi−→ Hi → 1,

1 ≤ i ≤ m,

with ϕi(aj) = hij for 1 ≤ j ≤ d.

Recall that F/R1

∼= H1 and F/Ri

∼= Hi are non-isomorphic just
inﬁnite groups. This gives Ri 6⊆ R1, and RiR1/R1 is a non-trivial closed
∼= H1. This implies ϕ1(Ri) Eo H1, and we
normal subgroup of F/R1
obtain ϕ1(Ri) ∩ π1(K (i−1)) ≤o π1(K (i−1)). By Lemma 2.2, there exists
xi−1 ∈ K (i−1) such that ϕ1(Ri) ∩ π1(K (i−1)) 6≤ Cπ1(K (i−1))(π1(xi−1)).

Consequently, we ﬁnd a word wi ∈ Ri such that wi(h11, . . . , h1d) /∈
Cπ1(K (i−1))(π1(xi−1)). Using the properties of K (i−1) and wi ∈ ker(πi),
it follows that zi = [wi(g1, . . . , gd), xi−1] ∈ K satisﬁes
(3.1)
Set K (i) = hziiK ≤c K. Visibly zi ∈ H1 × Hi+1 × · · · × Hm, hence
K (i) ≤ H1×Hi+1×· · ·×Hm. Moreover, π1(K (i)) = hbiH1 is a non-trivial
closed normal subgroup of the just inﬁnite group H1, so π1(K (i)) ≤o H1.

(mod Hi+1 × · · · × Hm), where 1 6= b ∈ H1.
