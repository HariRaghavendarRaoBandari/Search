ABSTRACT
Despite intensive searches, the only pulsar within 0.1 pc of the central black hole in our
Galaxy, Sgr A*, is a radio-loud magnetar. Since magnetars are rare among the Galactic neu-
tron star population, and a large number of massive stars are already known in this region,
the Galactic centre (GC) should harbor a large number of neutron stars. Population syntheses
suggest several thousand neutron stars may be present in the GC. Many of these could be
highly energetic millisecond pulsars which are also proposed to be responsible for the GC
gamma-ray excess. We propose that the presence of a neutron star within 0.03 pc from Sgr A*
can be revealed by the shock interactions with the disk around the central black hole. As we
demonstrate, these interactions result in observable transient non-thermal X-ray and gamma-
ray emission over timescales of months, provided that the spin down luminosity of the neutron
star is Lsd ∼ 1035 erg s−1. Current limits on the population of normal and millisecond pulsars
in the GC region suggest that a number of such pulsars are present with such luminosities.

1 INTRODUCTION

The compact radio source Sgr A* is believed to be the location
of the massive black hole in the Galactic centre (GC) of mass
MBH = 4.3 × 106 M⊙ (and corresponding gravitational radius
Rg = GMBH/c2 ≃ 6.4 × 1011 cm). Chandra has resolved the hot gas
surrounding Sgr A* at a scale of 1017 cm (Baganoﬀ et al. 2001).
Bremsstrahlung emission from this region accounts for much of
the observed quiescent soft (T ∼ 1 keV) X-rays of luminosity
Lx ∼ 2 × 1033 erg s−1. The inferred gas density at this distance
n ∼ 100 cm−3 (Baganoﬀ et al. 2003). Accretion onto the black hole
is likely to power an IR source of luminosity ∼ 1036 erg s−1 (Gen-
zel et al. 2010). Both IR and X-ray ﬂaring is observed on timescales
ranging from minutes to hours. Flares are believed to be associated
with processes that take place at the inner accretion disk, close to
the black-hole horizon (Baganoﬀ et al. 2001; Ghez et al. 2004).

Discovering radio pulsars in the GC is one of the holy grails
in astrophysics due to their promise as probes of the central super-
massive black hole (see, e.g., Psaltis et al. 2015), and in decipher-
ing the nature of the interstellar medium in its vicinity (Cordes &
Lazio 1997). The inner pc in the GC is expected to have hundreds
of radio emitting pulsars (see, e.g., Pfhal & Loeb 2004; Wharton et
al. 2012). The discovery of a magnetar within ∼ 0.1 pc srengthens
the case for their presence (Mori et al. 2013; Eatough et al. 2013).
In addition, some 20 massive stars are known to orbit Sgr A* within
1017 cm (Ghez et al. 2004). Such stars are expected to give birth to

pulsars. Further evidence for a signiﬁcant population of millisec-
ond pulsars (MSPs) in the GC region was recently presented by
Brandt & Kocsis (2015). These authors demonstrate that the 2 Gev
excess gamma-ray emission from the GC detected by Fermi is con-
sistent with an ensemble of order 1000 MSPs in this region. Similar
conclusions were also reached by other authors (Qiang & Zhang
2014). It should be noted, however, that the Fermi results can also
be explained by a dark matter model (e.g., Hooper & Goodenough
2011). A signiﬁcant eﬀort is being invested into further searches
for dark matter in the GC (see, e.g., van Eldick 2015).

One way to discriminate between the MSP and dark matter
scenarios would be the detection of MSPs in the GC. Macquart &
Kanekar (2015) predict optimal results for future radio surveys in
the 8 GHz band. Although such searches are now being carried out,
their success is strongly dependent on the scattering environment
in the GC region which is still not well understood. The principle
focus of this paper is to develop a new approach to constraining the
pulsar population in the GC. As shown schematically in Fig. 1, we
propose that when a neutron star (NS) approaches within ∼ 0.03 pc
from Sgr A*, the ram pressure from the accretion disk shocks the
pulsar wind fairly close to the NS. Pairs accelerated at the termi-
nation shock power a non-thermal, synchrotron ﬂare that will last
for months to years and can be detected in the X-ray band and,
possibly, at other wavelengths.

This Letter is organized as follows. In §2 we detail the emis-
sion processes of our model. In §3 we review the evidence for a sig-
niﬁcant number of NS in the GC region. In §4 we discuss prospects
for observing this population via our proposed mechanism.

Figure 1. Sketch showing the essence of our model. A NS passing through
the accretion disk around Sgr A*, with pericentre distance Rp, has a wind
that is suﬃciently energetic to produce a synchrotron emitting, bow-shock
region with termination distance rt which can be observable at X-ray ener-
gies.

2 TRANSIENT X-RAY EMISSION FROM GALACTIC

CENTRE NEUTRON STARS

NSs residing in the inner 0.1 pc of the GC are characterized by
fast motions with the winds undergoing strong interactions with
the gas surrounding Sgr A* and its accretion disk. Here we demon-
strate that when the NS dives into the accretion disk, its relativistic
wind is shocked, giving a powerful nonthermal X-ray and gamma-
ray transient that lasts from ∼ 1 month to years. Pulsar winds are
known to be bright X-ray and γ-ray sources when they interact with
an ionized medium (e.g., Romani et al. 1997). These interactions
are particularily intense in systems where the pulsar has a close,
massive star companion (Paredes et al. 2013; Dubus 2013). The in-
teraction model we propose, shown schematically in Fig. 1, is based
on earlier work by Giannios & Sironi (2013) can be applied to any
type of spin-powered pulsar.

We consider a NS with spin down luminosity Lsd in an eccen-
tric orbit around the central supermassive black hole with pericentre
passage at distance Rp ≪ 1 pc as shown in Fig. 1. At R ∼ 1017 cm,
the gas density is probed by its bremsstrahlung emission to be of
order n ∼ 100 cm−3 assuming a modest gas ﬁlling factor of ∼ 1/4 at
this scale (Baganoﬀ et al. 2003). At R < 1017cm, the gas may have
suﬃcient angular momentum to form an accretion disk. Because
of the low accretion rate to the black hole, the accretion is likely
to take place through a geometrically thick disk with its density
proﬁle being rather model dependent. Possible scalings range from
n ∝ R−3/2 as, e.g., motivated by the advection dominated accre-
tion ﬂow solution (Narayan et al. 1995) or n ∝ R−1 as, e.g., mo-
tivated by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations
(Tchekhovskoy & McKinney 2012). In the case of a convection
dominated accretion ﬂow solution, the density proﬁle is shallower
(n ∝ R−1/2; Quataert & Gruzinov 2000). For the estimates that fol-
low we adopt an intermediate proﬁle n = 1000/R16 cm−3, where
R = 1016R16 cm. A similar density proﬁle is expected if one al-
lows for moderate mass-loss in the disk through winds (Blandford
& Begelman 1999).

At the termination shock, pairs are expected to be accelerated
to provide a non-thermal particle distribution. We set the particle
distribution N(γ) ∝ γ−2 for γ > γmin ∼ 105 up to a maximum
synchrotron burnoﬀ limit (de Jager et al. 1996). The magnetic ﬁeld
pressure at the shocked region can be parameterized as a fraction
ǫB of the gas pressure. Assuming rough equipartition between par-
ticles and magnetic ﬁeld at the shock downstream (see, e.g., Porth,
Komissarov & Keppens 2014): B ∼ 0.04ǫ

In this framework, the emission from a pulsar of Lsd ∼ 1035 erg s−1
at a pericentre passage of Rp 6 1017 cm powers detectable X-ray
ﬂares because: (i) their X-ray luminosities are comparable to the
quiescent emission from Sgr A*; (ii) their spectra are distinctly
non-thermal extending into the hard X-ray band.

Figs. 2 and 3 show the synchrotron emission spectra at peri-

For E >

luminosity of the pulsar for the adopted particle power-law slope of
−2. This estimate is likely to be optimistic for the γ-ray emission
from the transient since, for a steeper particle index p < −2, the
γ-ray emission is weaker. The luminosity from the shocked wind
at pericentre can easily exceed that of the quiescent X-ray emis-
sion and, under favorable conditions, be comparable to that in the
Fermi-LAT band.

The pericentre passage of the pulsar takes place over a

timescale

(6)

This is also the characteristic timescale over which the pulsar wind
undergoes the most intense interaction with the surrounding accre-
tion disk and, as a result, marks the duration of the ﬂares. Whether
one expects a single ﬂare or a pair of ﬂares, depends on the relative
inclination of the orbit of the neutron star with respect to that of
the accretion disk (see Giannios & Sironi 2013). If the disk is co-
planar with the stellar orbit (e.g., they are co- or counter-rotating)
the emission from the bow shock will peak at pericentre. For large
inclination of the two orbital planes, two ﬂares are expected: one
before and one after the pericentre passage. Since for thick disks,

where the height is comparable to the radius, the timescale for each
crossing of the midplane of the disk is similar to the duration of
the pericentre passage tp (for lightcurve examples, see Giannios &
Sironi 2013).

The previous estimates of the synchrotron emission from the
shocked pulsar wind are based on a simple one-zone model. The
shocked ﬂuid follows a bow shock structure. The accelerated par-
ticles radiate substantially close to the termination shock but they
continue to radiate further back in the tail. The pulsar spends at
pericentre much longer the time it takes for the shocked ﬂuid to
leave the termination shock: tp/texp ∼ 104R1/2
. In the tail of
the bow shock, the shocked ﬂuid is still conﬁned by the thermal
pressure from the accretion disk. The pressure of the disk is not
negligible Pd ∼ 0.5ρdv2
k ∼ Pram/4; containing substabtial turbulent
magnetic ﬁeld of strength Bd ∼ 0.02ǫ
16 G. Therefore, after
a modest initial expansion, the shocked wind will undergo a much
longer process of mixing with the disk material. Substantial emis-
sion for the ultrarelativistic particles is expected at this stage pos-
sibly enhancing the power of the transient. The calculation of the
emission from this region requires a more detailed hydrodynamical
calculation that is beyond the scope of this Letter.

3 NEUTRON STARS WITHIN 0.1 PARSEC OF SGR A*

As demonstrated above, pulsars and MSPs with spin down lumi-
nosity Lsd ∼ 1035 erg s−1 and with orbit with pericentre distance
of rp ∼ 0.01 pc from Sgr A* make promising sources for an ob-
servable transient. Given the highly elliptical orbits of the stars
observed in the region (see next Section for details), these NS
are expected to spend most of their orbit at apocentre distance of
rapp ∼ 0.1pc. As can be seen from the current sample of pulsars
shown in Fig. 4, a signiﬁcant fraction, approximately 7% of all
observed pulsars, have Lsd > 1035 ergs s−1. For MSPs, the corre-
sponding fraction is 8%. It is important to note, however, that these
estimates are based on observationally selected samples of radio
pulsars which are necessarily biased towards bright objects. As we
show below, the true fraction of pulsars and MSPs in the population
will be less. In the following we estimate, using various arguments
how many pulsars and MSPs, may reside in the region of interest.

3.1 The young NS population

A simple argument can be made by noting that we have observed
one magnetar with projected distance of ∼ 0.1 pc from Sgr A*
(Mori et al. 2013; Eatough et al. 2013). In total there are 26 mag-
netars currently known in the Milky Way (for a complete list,
see Olausen & Kaspi 2014 and the McGill Magnetar Catalog1).
Their typical lifetime from spin-down age arguments is 104 yr,
giving a crude estimate on the magnetar birthrate to be one ev-
ery 104/26 ∼ 400 yr. When compared to the pulsar birthrate of
2–3 per century (Vranesevic et al. 2004; Faucher-Giguere & Kaspi
2006), we conclude that for every 10 NS born, one of these will
be a magnetar. The existence of one magnetar in Sgr A* therefore
suggests the existence of ∼ 10 NS younger than 104 yr. Most of the
pulsars in Fig. 4 with characteristic ages below 104 yr have Lsd >
1035 ergs s−1. Interestingly, those pulsars with ages below 104 yr but
Lsd < 1035 ergs s−1 are thought to be associated with the magnetar
population: J1550−5418 (Camilo et al. 2007), J1622−4950 (Levin
et al. 2010), J1734−3333 (Espinoza et al. 2011).

An independent check on this simple estimate of ∼ 10 NS
with Lsd > 1035 ergs s−1 can be made from the results of Chen-
namangalam & Lorimer (2014) who found an upper bound of 200
radio pulsars in the GC region that are beaming towards the Earth.

4

Giannios & Lorimer

Assuming a beaming fraction of 10% the total number of radio-
loud pulsars in this region is <
∼2000. Making use of the PsrPopPy
simulation software (Bates et al. 2014), we generated a sample of
radio pulsars which evolve with time according to the prescrip-
tion described in detail by Faucher-Giguere & Kaspi (2006). Un-
der these assumptions, we ﬁnd that the fraction of pulsars with
Lsd > 1035 ergs s−1 is approximately 0.5%. The results of Chen-
namangalam & Lorimer (2014) therefore limit the population of
Lsd > 1035 ergs s−1 to be < 10. Relaxing the assumption of spin-
down such that Lsd > 1034 ergs s−1 would raise this limit by a fur-
ther factor of three. Given the uncertainties involved in both these
estimates, we conclude that one can reasonably expect of the order
of several to a dozen non-recycled pulsars of substantial spin down
luminosity in the region of interest.

3.2 Millisecond pulsars

In their population study, making use of the diﬀuse gamma-
ray emission observed by Fermi, Hooper & Goodenough (2011),
Wharton et al. (2012) estimated the number of millisecond pul-
sars in the central 150 pc of Sgr A* to be < 5000. Similar re-
sults were also found using earlier EGRET observations by Wang
et al. (2005). To estimate the fraction of millisecond pulsars po-
tentially visible as X-ray transient sources, we again used the Psr-
PopPy package to simulate a population of pulsars spinning down
from a spin period distribution recently derived by Lorimer et
al. (2015) assuming a log-normal distribution of magnetic ﬁeld
strengths with a mean of 108 Gauss and a standard deviation of
0.5 in the log. The fraction of sources with Lsd > 1035 ergs s−1 is
approximately 0.1%, suggesting a population of < 5 sources. The
corresponding fraction above 1034 ergs s−1 is about 3%, implying a
population of < 150 millisecond pulsars.

4 DISCUSSION

So far one magnetar is known within 0.1 pc from the GC. There is
also evidence that the source G359.95–0.04 at a projected distance
of 0.3 pc from the GC is powered by the wind of an energetic pulsar
(Wang, Lu & Gotthelf 2006). We demonstrated above that N ∼
∼ 1035 ergs s−1 may be expected to
10 MSPs and pulsars with Lsd >
orbit arround Sgr A* within ∼ 0.1pc. These pulsars spend most of
their orbit at apocentre distance that determines their orbital period
of T ≃ 450(rapp/0.1pc)3/2 years. Depending on the ellipticity of
their orbit, they can have brief excursions close to Sgr A*. The
stars observed at this scale – the S cluster– are characterized by
highly elliptical orbits of median eccentricity e ≃ 0.8 (Genzel et
al. 2010). If the pulsars have similar orbits, their pericentre is rp =
(1 − e)rapp/(1 + e) ≃ 0.01 pc; well within the distance of interest
here. The rate at which pulsars have their pericentre passage may
be estimated to be ∼ N/T ∼ 2.2N1(rapp/0.1pc)−3/2 per century.

The relatively large gas density in this region, in connection
with the large pulsar velocities results in strong interactions of the
pulsar wind with the ambient gas. Pairs accelerated at the shocked
pulsar wind are strong synhrotron emitters. Given its high spatial
resolution, Chandra is well positioned to observe these interactions
in the X-ray band, Fermi-LAT may also be able to detect the source.
Characteristic signatures include a ﬂaring, non-thermal source with
luminosity >

∼1033 ergs s−1 that lasts for months or years.

Other observed sources within the Chandra PSF at SGR A *
are the steady bremsstrahlung emission from ∼ 1 keV gas and ﬂares
from the black-hole vicinity (Baganoﬀ et al. 2001). The ﬂares last

for minutes to hours and are clearly distinct from the ∼ month−year
long ﬂares that are discussed here. Month long ﬂares from the same
region may originate from the interaction on non-relativistic winds
of massive stars with the disk (Giannios & Sironi 2013). In this
case, however, the ﬂares are expected to be thermal and with their
emission peaking in the soft x-ray band, in contrast to the non-
thermal transients discussed here.

The interaction can serve as a probe of the density, temper-
ature and thickness of the accretion disk that surrounds Sgr A *
at a scale that is hard to probe otherwise (see also Nayakshin,
Cuadra & Sunyaev 2004; Giannios & Sironi 2013). The duration
of the event directly contrains the pericentre distance of the source
tp ∼ 3×107R3/2
16 s. Depending on the inclination of the NS orbit with
respect to that of the accretion disk, one or two ﬂares are possible.
We encourage Chandra archival searches for such long transients
as well as systematic monitoring of Sgr A*.
