(Dated: March 23, 2016)

To deepen the search for beyond the Standard Model physics, the Large Hadron Collider is pushing
to higher and higher luminosity. At high luminosity, precision physics becomes increasingly diﬃcult
due to contamination from additional proton collisions per bunch crossing called pile-up. In recent
years, many methods have been developed to cull this excess mostly low-energy radiation away from
important signal regions, but it has been unclear if these methods were amenable to systematically-
improvable theoretical understanding. In this paper, it is shown that one such method, soft drop
jet grooming, has excellent theoretical properties:
it is ultra-local, depending on only radiation
within a jet, and it is free of non-global logarithms. Calculations of the soft drop jet mass and
related observables are presented at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy matched to next-
to-next-to-leading ﬁxed-order in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. Once measured at the
Large Hadron Collider, precision comparisons between theory and data can be made, essentially
independent of the amount of pile-up contamination.

As the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN pushes
to higher luminosity, precision comparisons between data
and theory become more challenging. Observables which
might be computable if only two protons were colliding
become smeared, sometimes beyond recognition, by ra-
diation from the dozens of protons colliding in the same
bunch crossing, known as “pile-up” (see Fig. 1). A re-
lated smearing comes from the interaction of multiple
partons within the same proton collision, called “under-
lying event”.

One approach to handle this extra radiation is to model
it, tune the model with data, and incorporate it into
theory predictions. Another approach is to calculate it
from ﬁrst principles. In particular, the underlying event,
which entails violation of the simplest form of factoriza-
tion, is growing as an active area of research in Quan-
tum Chromodynamics (QCD) [1–4]. A third approach
is to remove it altogether. Techniques such as jet trim-
ming [5], pruning [6], jet area subtraction [7], jet cleans-
ing [8], PUPPI [9], etc., have already proved essential
for many new physics searches. Indeed, pile-up removal
is necessary for new physics bump-hunts, either data-
driven or Monte-Carlo based. Such searches typically do
not require extreme precision since backgrounds can be
modeled by smooth distributions ﬁt in side-band regions.

There are many situations, however, in which we want
to be able to compare data directly to theory, such as
in the precision measurement of a coupling or mass.
Then, we need to know exactly how the pile-up re-
moval algorithms treat all forms of radiation produced
in the ﬁnal state. From the point of view of perturba-
tive QCD, these algorithms are extremely complicated:
many involve iterative methods, non-local sampling, and
infrared-unsafe information such as the energy in charged
particles, and are therefore not well-suited to precision
theory. So the natural question is: is there an algorithm
which is both useful and amenable to precision theoreti-
cal study? Reasonable criteria for an aﬃrmative answer

FIG. 1. Comparison of the distribution of the jet mass to

bias events in Herwig++.

are the explicit calculation of an observable beyond the
level of Monte-Carlo event generators and a demonstra-
tion that the calculation can be systematically improved.
In this paper, we show that the soft drop grooming al-
gorithm [10] and modiﬁed mass drop groomer (mMDT)
[11] has these desired properties. We calculate some
soft drop groomed observables to next-to-next-to-leading
order (NNLO) with next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic
(NNLL) resummation and provide an all-orders factor-
ization theorem within the framework of soft-collinear
eﬀective theory [12–15].

From an experimental point of view, the key to soft
drop is the observation that the contamination radia-
tion is almost entirely of low energy (soft), relative to

��-��������������������������������������������������������������������������������++��������→�+�����>��������=����������������=����β=���������������+��������������������������������+��the energy of the radiation we want to keep, say, in a
jet. The algorithm is very simple. We start with a jet,
deﬁned according to an infrared and collinear safe al-
gorithm, then recluster the constituents of the jet with
the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm [16, 17]. We then step
through the reconstructed branching history, and at a
given branching with branches i and j, if

then the softer branch is removed, and the procedure
continues to the next branching that remains. The al-
gorithm terminates when a hard branching failing Eq. 1
is found. Here, Ei is the energy of branch i, θij is the
relative angle between the branches, and R is the original
jet algorithm’s radius. zcut and β are the parameters of
the soft drop groomer, where zcut ∼ 0.1 and β = 0 or 1
are typical choices. For β = 0 (corresponding to mMDT)
the constraint is based solely on energy, so all soft radi-
ation, including soft-collinear radiation is dropped. For
β > 0, soft radiation is not dropped if it is suﬃciently
collinear. By discarding low energy radiation, soft drop
makes observables almost entirely insensitive to pile-up
and underlying event (cf. Fig. 1).

From a theoretical point of view, the key to soft drop
is that it manages to make observables local – depending
on radiation only in the jets, not throughout the event –
without introducing the dangerous non-global logarithms
[18] that can spoil factorization and plague many jet ob-
servables. To understand how this happens, let us ﬁrst
review an observable that does not factorize nicely: jet
mass with an energy veto. The out-of-jet veto scale Ω and
the jet mass m must be small compared to the center-
of-mass collision energy Q to ensure factorization of the
cross section. For an event with n jets, the diﬀerential
cross section dσ of the n jet masses {mj} factorizes into
a convolution dσ ∼ H × S ⊗ J ⊗ ··· ⊗ J with H a hard
function, S a soft function and J a jet function. The hard
function only depends on the jet energies {Qj} and the
angles between the jets. Each jet function depends on one
jet mass, and the soft function S depends on Ω as well as
the small light-cone momentum component of radiation
within each jet. Because the soft function depends on
multiple kinematic quantities, and hence multiple scales,
one cannot easily resum all of its large logarithms with
the renormalization group. It has what are called non-
global logarithms. Moreover, one cannot simply ignore
Ω, being inclusive over out-of-jet radiation. Small Ω is
required for the factorized form of the cross section to be
valid and ensure agreement with full QCD in the thresh-
old limit.

Now consider measuring jet masses after soft drop
grooming the jets.
In the limit that the masses are
small, the cross section again factorizes into hard, jet,
and soft functions. Say a jet has energy Qj and mass
mj after grooming. Consider some particle within the

2

j (cid:28) zcutQ2

jet of energy E and at an angle θ to the jet axis.
The invariant mass of this particle and the jet is then
j = 4QjE sin2 θ
m2
2 . Thus, for the groomed jet mass to
be small (mj (cid:28) Qj), the particle can either be soft and
wide angle (E ∼ m2
j /Qj, θ ∼ 1), collinear (θ (cid:28) 1), or
both soft and collinear. However, for any ﬁxed zcut, in
the limit mj (cid:28) Qj where the factorization theorem ap-
plies, all the soft wide-angle radiation must fail soft drop
(EQj ∼ m2
j ). It therefore only contributes a
zcut-dependent normalization factor, SG(zcut). Thus af-
ter soft drop, the only radiation which contributes to the
mass is collinear and the factorization theorem reduces to
dσ = H({Qj})×SG(zcut)×J(zcut, m1)⊗···⊗J(zcut, mn).
This is a key result. It implies that the soft drop mass
distribution in each jet is universal: it only depends on
the jet direction and ﬂavor, not on any other jet in the
event, the underlying event, or any other source of soft
radiation such as pile-up.

We can go further. The jet function J(zcut, m) depends
on both the soft drop scale zcut and the jet mass. Thus
it could have dangerous non-global logarithms. However,
assuming that zcut (cid:28) 1, collinear radiation which is not
soft must be insensitive to zcut, so we can pull an inclu-
sive zcut-independent jet function J(m) out of J(zcut, m).
The remaining dependence of J(zcut, m) on zcut and m is
due to radiation that is both soft and collinear to the jet
direction nµ. Being collinear, its momentum q satisﬁes
q− = q · ¯n (cid:29) q · n = q+, where ¯nµ is the direction back-
wards to the jet. Thus q− ≈ 2q0 = 2E and q+ ≈ m2/Q.
In the case of β = 0, in which Eq. 1 is simply an energy
requirement, Lorentz invariance then implies that the re-
maining dependence of J(zcut, m) is only on the combi-
nation m2zcut. For β > 0, a similar argument shows that
the soft and collinear radiation depends on the combina-
tion m2z
cut . Therefore the cross section fully factorizes

ation that is both soft and collinear to the jet direction.
The hard function H IJ and the global soft function
SIJ
G are complicated: they depend on the number of hard
directions in the event and the color structures. Criti-
cally, however, neither of these two functions depend on
the observables {mj}. Thus they only contribute to the
overall normalization. Because of this, we can compute
the product HSG by matching to ﬁxed-order QCD. The
remaining soft-collinear functions SC and jet functions
J depend only on a single infrared scale. Thus all of
the logarithms of the {mj} can be resummed using the

side (calculated in full QCD) can be computed using
the program Event2 [25]. The right-hand side depends
on 1-loop results and 2-loop anomalous dimensions. A
comparison between the two predictions for the heavy-
hemisphere soft drop groomed mass is shown in Fig. 2;
note the excellent agreement in the singular region. In
this ﬁgure, we plot the diﬀerence between Event2 out-
put and our NNLL result in the three diﬀerent color chan-
nels at order α2
s.
For soft drop parameter β (cid:54)= 0, we cannot directly re-
late the anomalous dimension of the global soft function
to calculations in the literature. Nevertheless, again ex-
ploiting renormalization group invariance of Eq. 2, we
can use Event2 to extract the 2-loop non-cusp anoma-
lous dimension of the collinear-soft function. Subtracting
all known terms at order α2
s and ﬁtting the zcut power
corrections, for β = 1, we ﬁnd

The quoted uncertainties are in part statistical, and in
part due to numerical imprecision as Event2 probes the
deep infrared. Our method of extraction is validated by
comparing ﬁt values to the exact results for β = 0.

With the complete 2-loop anomalous dimensions, we
can compute the soft drop mass distribution to NNLL
s results from Event2,
accuracy. Given also the order α2
we can predict the distribution at NNLL+NNLO order.
The resulting calculation is shown in Fig. 3 and com-
pared to Herwig++ 2.7.1 [26, 27] analyzed in FastJet
3.1.3 [28]. The green bands represent estimates of the-
ory uncertainties by varying scales of the functions in
the factorization theorem. For β = 1, we also include
the variation of the 2-loop non-cusp anomalous dimen-
sion in Eq. 4. We see very good agreement. Also note
that hadronization has a large eﬀect on the distribution,
but only for very small groomed jet masses. This is simi-
lar to how hadronization aﬀects the ordinary ungroomed
heavy jet mass distribution, but pushed to lower scales.
Hadronization can be included in the theory prediction
using a model shape function [29, 30].
Next, let us turn to hadron collisions. The same fac-
torization theorem applies at proton colliders as at e+e−
colliders, with the usual modiﬁcations of replacing en-
ergy E by transverse momentum pT and polar angle
θ by pseudorapidity η. Conveniently, the collinear-soft
functions and jet functions are exactly the same, assum-
ing central narrow jets. Indeed, the distribution of each
jet mass is nearly the same as well, up to the normal-
ization factors encoded in the HSG product in Eq. (2).
The main substantive change is that at hadron colliders
there is a mixture of quark and gluon jets. At leading
power, that is, in the limit that the jets are very jet-
like (mJ (cid:28) pT J ), the fraction of jets which are quark or
gluon is well-deﬁned. Technically, this can be seen from

FIG. 2. By comparing to the exact 2-loop result, we check
that the singular terms in the heavy hemisphere soft drop
groomed mass are reproduced by the factorization theorem.

free of non-global logarithms. Moreover, the collinear-
soft and jet functions only depend on jet ﬂavor (quark
or gluon), and not on any global structure of the event
or on a matrix in color space. So one can even sum over
contributions to the cross section with diﬀerent numbers
of jets and still have a precision prediction for the soft
drop groomed jet mass.

To resum the cross section, we need the anomalous
dimensions of the various objects. The resummation of
logarithms of the groomed jet masses requires the anoma-
lous dimensions only of the inclusive jet function J, which
is known to at least 2-loops [19, 20], and of the collinear-
soft functions SC. Thus, from a practical perspective,
we do not need to separate the hard and global soft func-
tions.
Instead we can compute their product to ﬁxed-
order then evolve the jet and collinear-soft functions up
to the renormalization group scale at which the ﬁxed or-
der results are computed. The anomalous dimension of
SC can be computed directly, but it is simpler to derive
it using renormalization group invariance of Eq. (2)
For the simplest case of e+e− → dijets events, H and
its anomalous dimension are known to 3 loops [21, 22].
For soft drop with β = 0, the anomalous dimension of
SG in this case is closely related to the 2-loop anomalous
dimension of the soft function with a global energy veto
extracted in Ref. [23] from the calculation in Ref. [24]. By
calculating additional eﬀects associated with the Cam-
bridge/Aachen reclustering step of the soft drop algo-
rithm, we ﬁnd the non-cusp part of the anomalous di-
mension of the collinear-soft function at 2-loops:

the lack of mixing between operators with diﬀerent types
of jets (see Ref. [31] for some discussion). However, one
normally cannot compute this fraction in perturbative
QCD simply by counting the number of quarks minus
the number of antiquarks in the jet. Such a procedure
is infrared unsafe: adding a soft quark to the jet and a
soft anti-quark outside of it would change this counting.
However, with soft drop, adding an arbitrarily soft quark
to a jet has no eﬀect. Collinear splittings do not change
the number of quarks in a jet either. Thus at leading
power for any ﬁnite zcut, one can classify the ﬂavor of a
jet in an infrared safe way by its quark number.

We are therefore led to a simple procedure:

com-
pute the relative fractions of quark and gluon soft drop
groomed jets at ﬁxed order, and use it to weight the

resummed distributions. For example, the mass of the
highest pT jet in some event class is given by

(cid:88)

Dk SC,k ⊗ Jk +

(5)

Here Dk is the cross section of soft drop groomed quark
or gluon jets produced, as extracted from a ﬁxed-order
code. dσﬁn. is the ﬁnite matching correction, given by
the diﬀerence between the ﬁxed-order prediction and the
ﬁxed-order expansion of the factorized result.
As an example application we compute the soft drop
groomed mass of the hardest jet in pp → Z + j events at
the 13 TeV LHC. We require pT Z > 300 GeV, pT J > 500
GeV, |ηZ| < 2.5 and |ηJ| < 2.5. We ﬁnd the jets using

jets with soft drop. We use MCFM [33, 34] to compute
the ﬁxed order distribution and accomplish full NNLO
accuracy by demanding that the jets have non-zero mass
and using the NLO pp → Z + 2j event generation. Using
MCFM, we can determine the Dk normalization factors
and match our NNLL resummed result to NNLO.

The resulting predictions for soft drop groomed jet
mass for both β = 0 and β = 1 is shown in Fig. 4. Be-
cause the shape of the distribution is purely determined
by collinear emissions in the jet, we have normalized the
distributions to integrate to the same value on the range
T J ∈ [0.001, 0.1]. We include both NLL+NLO
m2/p2
and NNLL+NNLO predictions and their associated un-
certainty bands, demonstrating that scale uncertainties
decrease in going to higher order.
In these plots, we
compare to Herwig++ and Pythia 8.210 [35, 36] run
with default settings, which includes underlying event
and hadronization. Agreement with our analytic calcu-
lation is generally good, though some diﬀerences exist.

In conclusion, we have shown how precision jet physics
can persist even in the regime of ultra-high luminosity. A
particular jet grooming algorithm, soft drop, is not only
eﬃcacious, removing essentially all pile-up, but also lends
to remarkable factorization properties. In particular, the
factorization formulas for soft drop observables like jet
mass are free of non-global logarithms to all orders. The
calculation becomes ultra-local:
involving only physics
within the jet; the global structure, such as the other jets
in the event, only aﬀects the overall normalization. This
opens the door for detailed comparisons between theory
and data even at the ultra-high luminosities planned for
the LHC and future colliders. Calculational details will
be presented in a future publication.
