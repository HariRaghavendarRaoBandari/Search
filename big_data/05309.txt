ABSTRACT

Aims. We report the discovery of a young lithium rich giant, HD 16771, in the core-helium burning phase that does not seem to ﬁt
existing proposals of Li synthesis near the luminosity function bump or during He-core ﬂash. We aim to understand the nature of Li
enrichment in the atmosphere of HD 16771 by exploring various Li enhancement scenarios.
Methods. We have collected high-resolution echelle spectra of HD 16771 and derived stellar parameters and chemical abundances
for 27 elements by either line equivalent widths or synthetic spectrum analyses.
Results. HD 16771 is a Li-rich (log (Li)=+2.67 ± 0.10 dex) intermediate mass giant star (M = 2.4 ± 0.1 M(cid:12)) with age∼ 0.76 ± 0.13
Gyr and located at the red giant clump. Kinematics and chemical compositions are consistent with HD 16771 being a member of the
Galactic thin disk population. The non-detection of 6Li (< 3%), a low carbon isotopic ratio (12C/13C=12±2), and the slow rotation
(v sini=2.8 km s−1) all suggest that lithium might have been synthesized in this star. On the contrary, HD 16771 with a mass of
2.4 M(cid:12) has no chance of encountering luminosity function bump and He-core ﬂash where the possibility of fast deep-mixing for Li
enrichment in K giants has been suggested previously.
Conclusions. Based of the evolutionary status of this star, we discuss the possibility that 7Li synthesis in HD 16771 is triggered by
the engulfment of close-in planet(s) during the RGB phase.

1. Introduction

Lithium depletion in giants is a natural consequence of stellar
evolution. Soon after stars leave the main sequence the outer
layers expand and cool, a star’s rotation rate slows, the convec-
tion zone deepens and sweeps to the surface material from inter-
nal layers. This ﬁrst dredge-up causes an overall dilution of Li
abundance by about 1-2 dex (Iben 1967a,b). Indeed, abundance
analysis of G and K giants (Brown et al. 1989) even show much
lower Li abundances in many giants than the expectations of
standard stellar models (Iben 1967a,b) indicative of signiﬁcant
Li depletion during the pre-main and/or main sequence phases,
and to some extent due to non-canonical mixing on the red giant
branch (RGB). At the end of ﬁrst dredge-up, signiﬁcant abun-
dance alterations to the giant’s atmosphere are the depletion of
fragile Li, increase in 4He, 14N, 13C, and dilution of 12C thereby
lowering the 12C/13C ratio down to ∼ 20−30 from its initial value
of 90 on the main sequence (Charbonnel et al. 1998).

In spite of this convective mixing, a fraction of giants in the
Galactic disk exhibit abnormally high Li abundances exceeding
by nearly 2-3 orders of magnitude the standard model predic-
tions for stars on the RGB1 (Brown et al. 1989; Charbonnel
& Balachandran 2000; Kumar et al. 2011), and a few of
them present rapid rotation (see Carlberg et al. 2012 and ref-
erences therein), strong infrared (IR) excesses (de La Reza
et al. 1996), and anomalously low 12C/13C ratios (Sneden et al.
1986). Proposals that giants synthesize 7Li via Cameron-Fowler
(Cameron & Fowler 1971) 7Be-transport mechanism near RGB

1 K giants with log (Li)> 1.5 dex are treated as Li-rich while those
with Li abundances exceeding the present interstellar medium abun-
dance, log (Li)> 3.1 dex, are termed as super Li-rich.

bump in low mass stars (Charbonnel & Balachandran 2000)
and/or during the He-core ﬂash in stars of M<2.2 M(cid:12) (Kumar
et al. 2011) have been challenged by the discovery of super
Li-rich giants at magnitudes that span the RGB (Monaco et al.
2011; Martell & Shetrone 2013). These observations imply that
Li enrichment may not be limited to speciﬁc stellar evolutionary
stages. Numerous models proposed hitherto are far from reach-
ing a consensus on the synthesis of Li in K giants which may
partly be attributed to the paucity of data on Li-rich K giants (see
e.g. Monaco et al. 2011 and Carlberg et al. 2012 and references
therein).

Here we report the detection of a warm Li-rich clump-giant,
a few of them found previously by Brown et al. (1989) and
Martell & Shetrone (2013), whose mass and location in the
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram is incompatible with an en-
counter with the luminosity function bump (LFB) or He-core
ﬂash where the internal production of Li in giants was pro-
posed previously (Charbonnel & Balachandran 2000; Kumar
et al. 2011). Here, we restrict ourselves to discussing the chem-
ical composition of HD 16771 and its evolutionary state in the
HR diagram with an emphasis on providing a plausible scenario
for the observed Li enrichment.

2. Observations and data reduction
The sample red giant star HD 16771 analysed in this letter was
selected as a part of the program dedicated to measure chem-
ical abundances for red giants in open clusters (OCs; Reddy
et al. 2012, 2013, 2015). High-resolution (R ∼ 60,000) and high
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio optical spectra of HD 16771 were
acquired during the night of 2013 November with the Robert
G. Tull coud´e cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph (Tull et al.

1995) at the 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith reﬂector of the McDonald
observatory. The spectra were reduced to 1D in multiple steps
using various routines available in the standard spectral reduc-
tion software IRAF2.
The wavelength range 3600 − 9800 Å spread across various
echelle orders covered in a single 1200 s exposure is suﬃcient to
perform an abundance analysis of many elements. The spectrum
has a S/N ratio of about 220 as measured around 6000 Å re-
gion and about 250 near the lithium resonance doublet at 6707.8
Å, while at wavelengths shorter than 4000 Å the S/N ratio de-
creases and falls to 35 around 3600 Å region. We measured a
heliocentric radial velocity (RV) of +6.9±0.1 km s−1 which is in
fair agreement with Mermilliod et al. (2008) value of +7.1±0.3
km s−1. The methods of data reduction and RV measurements
are described in detail in Reddy et al. (2012, 2013, 2015).

Although HD 16771 as mentioned in the SIMBAD3 astro-
nomical database is a member of the OC NGC 1039/M 34, both
the proper motions (µαcosδ, µδ) and RV measurements of the
star diﬀer by (+38, -11) mas/yr and 16 km s−1 from those values
measured for the cluster dwarfs (Jones & Prosser 1996). Hence,
we consider the star as a member of the Galactic disk in the clus-
ter ﬁeld.

3. Abundance analysis
We performed a diﬀerential abundance analysis relative to the
Sun by running the abﬁnd driver of MOOG(Sneden 1973) adopt-
ing the 1D model atmospheres (Castelli & Kurucz 2004) and the
iron line equivalent widths (EWs) following our local thermo-
dynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundance analysis technique de-
scribed in Reddy et al. (2012, 2013, 2015). The atmospheric
parameters are derived by force-ﬁtting the model generated
iron line EWs to the observed ones by imposing the excita-
tion and ionization equilibrium and the independence between
the iron abundances and EWs. The ﬁnal stellar parameters of
HD 16771 derived using the iron lines are: eﬀective temperature
(Teﬀ)= 5050±50 K, surface gravity (log g)= 2.7±0.1 cm s−2, mi-
croturbulence (ξt)= 1.35±0.08 km s−1 and the iron abundance
[Fe/H]=−0.12 ± 0.05 dex.
In most cases, the abundances are derived from the mea-
sured EWs but a few lines were analysed with synthetic spectra.
We used a standard synthetic proﬁle ﬁtting procedure (Reddy
et al. 2015) and smoothed the computed proﬁles before match-
ing to the observed ones with Gaussian proﬁles representing the
instrumental proﬁle, and then macroturbulence (Vmacro) and the
rotation (v sini) proﬁle of the star. The instrumental broadening
was measured as the average of widths of three thorium-argon
lines in the same echelle order as the stellar feature analysed by
spectrum synthesis. We derived an average v sini of 2.8 ± 0.6
km s−1 and Vmacro =3.0 ± 0.4 km s−1 by ﬁtting relatively isolated
iron lines at 5307.4, 5141.7, 5466.9, 6187.9, 6705.1, 6739.5 and
6750.1 Å following the procedure described in Carlberg et al.
(2012).

3.1. Li, CNO abundances and 12C/13C ratios
The abundances of lithium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen as well as
the carbon 12C/13C isotopic ratios were derived by ﬁtting syn-

thetic spectra to selected regions of observed spectrum. As the
Li resonance doublet at 6707.8 Å is blended with several weak
CN, Si, Ca, V and Fe features (Ghezzi et al. 2009), it is necessary
to predetermine their abundances before analysing the lithium
feature.
We obtained a carbon abundance of [C/H]= −0.32 ± 0.06
from the analysis of C2 Swan (1,0) lines at 5135 Å and the
permitted carbon line at 5380 Å. The nitrogen abundance of
[N/H]= +0.25 ± 0.06 was derived by modelling of several
12C14N lines in the 6332 Å and 7938 Å regions and, the oxy-
gen abundance of [O/H]= −0.08 ± 0.05 from the analysis of IR
triplet (7772, 7774 and 7775 Å) and the forbidden line at 6300
Å. The oxygen abundance derived from the IR triplet was ad-
justed for the non-LTE eﬀects by adopting empirical non-LTE
corrections from Afs¸ar et al. (2012). Here, we referred the C,
N and O abundances of HD 16771 to the solar abundances of
log (C)= 8.37 dex, log (N)= 7.98 dex, and log (O)= 8.83 dex
derived using our linelists.

The carbon 12C/13C isotopic ratio, which is an informative
diagnostic of mixing processes (Charbonnel et al. 1998) oper-
ating in the stellar atmospheres during the evolution of red gi-
ants, was measured from the synthesis of 12CH and 13CH fea-
tures (Lambert & Dearborn 1972) at 4231 Å (Figure 1). We
derived a 12C/13C ratio of 12±2, indicating that the dredge-up
episodes have thoroughly mixed the surface material with the
stellar interior. The molecular data for C2 comes from Ram et al.
(2014), CH and CN data are taken from Masseron et al. (2014)
and Sneden et al. (2014), respectively.

Thereafter, we measured the lithium abundance from the
synthesis of resonance doublet at 6707.8 Å adopting the hyper-
ﬁne structure data from Ghezzi et al. (2009). A ﬁt to the observed
lithium proﬁle without the need for 6Li, as shown in Figure 2, is
obtained for a LTE abundance of log (Li)= +2.67 ± 0.10 dex.
Our LTE lithium abundance was corrected for the non-LTE cor-
rections provided by Lind et al. (2009) for a star of given Teﬀ,
log g, ξt and [Fe/H].

As HD 16771 has no measured stellar parallax (π), initial
guess of π was made by incorporating the derived spectroscopic
atmospheric parameters into the known relation

log π= 0.5 [log(g/g(cid:12))−log(M/M(cid:12))−4 log(Teﬀ/Teﬀ(cid:12))]

− 0.2(V − AV + BCV + 0.25)

where AV is the interstellar extinction in V band and the bolo-
metric correction BCV is estimated from the spectroscopic Teﬀ
and [Fe/H] using Alonso et al’s (1999) calibration. Here we
adopt log g(cid:12)= 4.44 cm s−2 and Teﬀ,(cid:12)= 5777 K and assume that
HD 16771 has a mass of M= 2.0 M(cid:12).

Using the Johnson V magnitude along with the spectroscopic
Teﬀ and [Fe/H], our guess of π = 4.6 mas is varied until the sur-
face gravity estimate from the PARAM4 code (da Silva et al.
2006) and PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks (Bressan et al.
2012) matches our spectroscopically determined value of log g,
i.e., 2.7 cm s−2. We adopted the stellar mass and age of HD
16771 from the isochrone that corresponds to our best measured
value of π = 3.95 ± 0.15 mas.
The spatial velocities (ULS R, VLS R, WLS R)=(-24.9, -29.8,
10.0) km s−1, distance away from the Galactic plane z=0.07 kpc,
and a thin disk membership probability (Reddy et al. 2015) of
98% along with the chemical composition (see Table 1) of HD
16771 agree well for an object typical from the Galactic thin
disk. A summary of stellar parameters of HD 16771 is presented
in Table 2.

4. Discussion
According to the PARSEC evolutionary tracks (Bressan et al.
2012) and a Bayesian estimation method (da Silva et al. 2006),
HD 16771 at a distance of 253 ± 10 pc from the Sun (see Table
2), and with a mass M = 2.4 ± 0.1 M(cid:12) and age = 0.76 ± 0.13
Gyr shares the region enjoyed by the He-core burning clump
giants that have evolved to the clump via the RGB tip in the
HR−diagram. The position of HD 16771 (large red dot) and the
other Li-rich giants extracted from Adam´ow et al. (2014, 2015,
green), Silva Aguirre et al. (2014, magenta), Jofr´e et al. (2015,
purple), and from Kumar et al. (2011, blue) and additional stars
collected by Kumar et al. from the literature (black squares) are
shown in the HR−diagram (Figure 3) along with the PARSEC
evolutionary tracks computed for stars in the mass range from
0.9 to 3.8 M(cid:12) from Bressan et al. (2012).

The lithium content of log (Linon−LT E)= +2.64 dex in the
atmosphere of HD 16771 declares the star to be a Li-rich gi-
ant but can not be readily explained with Li synthesis occur-

ring during the LFB or at the He-core ﬂash. HD 16771 with
a mass M = 2.4 ± 0.1 M(cid:12) has no chance of encountering the
LFB as the RGB ﬁnishes (Sackmann & Boothroyd 1999) be-
fore the H-burning shell reaches the µ-barrier and thus no extra-
mixing process is expected to trigger Li production via cool bot-
tom process (Sackmann & Boothroyd 1999). Also it should not
have experienced He-core ﬂash at the RGB tip as the star with
mass M≥ 2.2 M(cid:12) starts burning He in its core (Charbonnel &

that have evolved through both the LFB and He-core ﬂash
stages. However, for high mass stars (M> 2.2 M(cid:12)) with non-
degenerate He cores, Li evolution ceases once the star completes
ﬁrst dredge-up.

If fresh 7Be is synthesized via Cameron-Fowler mechanism
in the interior of a star like HD 16771, the mixing should be fast
enough to carry 7Be (and 7Li) to cool layers where it decays to
7Li. Indeed, Denissenkov (2012) proposed a stirring mechanism
in the RGB phase of low-mass stars with fast internal rotation
which leads to a temperature gradient between the hydrogen-
burning shell and the envelope that permits enhanced mixing
across the radiative zone. As a consequence, a low-mass star
make extended zigzags toward the position of the red-clump
star, before resuming its ascent along the RGB. As the theo-
retical models do not predict Li production during the He-core
ﬂash, Denissenkov (2012) proposed that the red-clump stars in
the study of Kumar et al. (2011) are LFB low-mass stars which
had made their excursion in the HR-diagram towards luminosi-
ties compatible with the expected location of red-clump stars.
However, our star has a very low probability to encounter such
scenario and sits on the high temperature side and far away from
the LFB found for low mass stars (Figure 3).

Several other sources of enhanced extra-mixing have been
suggested to explain the presence of Li-rich giants all along
the RGB. Among those are Denissenkov & Weiss (2000) and
Denissenkov & Herwig (2004) models of activation of 7Be-
transport mechanism followed by the engulﬁng of a giant planet
(Alexander 1967). The engulﬁng of close-in planets might cause
shear instabilities at the base of the convective envelope that
could turn-on the dynamo action (Siess & Livio 1999). The as-
sociated thermohaline (Charbonnel & Zahn 2007) and magneto-
thermohaline mixing (Denissenkov et al. 2009) could circulate
the material fast enough to replenish Li in the stellar envelope
that also lowers the 12C/13C ratio from its ﬁrst dredge-up value.
Exoplanets observations show deﬁciency of close-in planets
around evolved stars compared to their main sequence counter-
parts, for which planet engulfment is likely a plausible explana-
tion (Villaver et al. 2014). In principle, HD 16771 has evolved
enough to engulf a putative close-in planet, as in known hot
Jupiter systems, for which the semi major axis is usually less
than 0.05 AU (Adam´ow et al. 2015). On the account of posi-
tive detection of Li excess in HD 16771 at the red-clump phase,
we speculate that the engulﬁng of planet would have occurred
during RGB stage, where the giant’s outer envelope expands
and reaches to its maximum stellar radius at the RGB tip. And
for stars with M = 2.4 M(cid:12) the critical initial semi-major axis
for engulfment is ∼ 0.12-0.18 AU and for giant stars in the age
range 620−650 Myr (Delgado Mena et al. 2016). Therefore, HD
16771 with an age of 760±130 Myr would have undergone extra-
mixing triggered by the engulfment of planet(s) probably 100
Myr ago and yet the observed Li overabundance suggest that the
elapsed time is insuﬃcient for Li dilution. Also the rapid evo-
lution from the RGB to red-clump phase and the shallow con-
vective envelope of the He-core burning stars could aid in pre-
serving Li as the envelope material hardly circulates to the hot
internal layers where Li is promptly destroyed (Delgado Mena
et al. 2016).

Siess & Livio (1999) have suggested that engulfment of sub-
stellar objects not only raise the star’s 7Li abundance but could
also trigger a prompt mass-loss, spin-up of the star, and the pos-
sible generation of magnetic ﬁelds, depending on the masses of
both star and planet and on the planets orbital parameters. The
slow rotation of 2.8 km s−1, typical for an evolved giant, suggest
that HD 16771 could have undergone eﬃcient rotational brak-

Lagarde 2010) while on the RGB. Moreover, the star can not
have operated the hot bottom burning mechanism (Sackmann &
Boothroyd 1992) probably responsible for Li production in stars
high on the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Even allowing for
errors in the ingredients used in the estimation of stellar mass,
the location of HD 16771 on the HR diagram supports these con-
clusions.

In this vein, we note the detection of warm Li-rich clump-
giants with masses above 2.2 M(cid:12) in two diﬀerent studies: Martell
& Shetrone (2013) have identiﬁed a sample of clump-giants
with the combination of Teﬀ=5000-5200, log g=2.6-3.1 and
12C/13C≤15. The study of Brown et al. (1989) has included
a clump-giant HD 120602 with Teﬀ=5000, log g=3.00 whose
12C/13C has been measured at 16 (Berdyugina & Savanov 1994).
HD 16771 with 12C/13C=12±2 is another such example whose
Li enrichment is not linked to the episode of extra-mixing near
the LFB or He-core ﬂash as suggested previously for stars of
mass M<2.2 M(cid:12) (Charbonnel & Balachandran 2000; Kumar
et al. 2011). Here, we avoid plotting the sample of Martell &
Shetrone (2013) in Figure 3, as they have no measured paral-
laxes or V magnitudes.
the observed low values of C/N∼0.7 and
12C/13C∼12, although far from the predictions of conventional
mixing (Charbonnel et al. 1998), clearly show that HD 16771
has experienced non-canonical mixing and thus the possibility
of preserving initial main-sequence lithium content and external
pollution from a companion is excluded. Moreover, the external
pollution from an evolved Li-rcih AGB companion is associated
with the enhancements in the s-process elements, characteristics
not carried by HD 16771. Together ﬁve epochs of RV observa-
tions collected from Mermilliod et al. (2008) show no sign of
binarity.

However,

Thus, the lithium overabundance in HD 16771 requires an
alternative to models of extra-mixing (see Carlberg et al. 2012
and references therein) that invoke destruction of µ-barrier in
solar metallicity stars with degenerate He cores (M< 2.2 M(cid:12))

ing in this time frame and carried away most of the envelope’s
angular momentum in a mass-loss event. Others who have con-
sidered planet accretion as the solution to Li enhancement in
some giant stars include Adam´ow et al. (2012), Carlberg et al.
(2012) and Delgado Mena et al. (2016). A major fraction of Li-
rich giants with planets in those studies present v sini < 4 km
s−1, and our giant would be one such candidate showing a slow
rotational velocity. These results, as previously noted by Fekel
& Balachandran (1993), weaken the claim that planet ingestion,
high lithium abundance and rapid rotation are related inextrica-
bly, as the timescales for Li enrichment are not necessarily the
same as the timescales for rotational spin-up and spin-down, or
for increased or decreased Ca II H and K emission.

A thorough investigation of IR ﬂuxes extracted from 2MASS
(Cutri et al. 2003) and WISE (Wright et al. 2010) reveals no sign
of IR excess at short wavelengths (i.e., J, K, and WISE[3.4, 4.6,
12 and 22 µm]). Using the test given by de La Reza et al. (1996),
which makes use of the [60-25] and [25-12] IRAS data, we con-
ﬁrm that HD 16771, in common with BD+48 740 (Adam´ow
et al. 2012), shows IR excess at 60 µm, suggesting that the en-
gulfment happened some time ago allowing the shell time to ex-
pand and cools down. Supporting this assertion are the lack of
observations of asymmetric Hα and irregular Na D lines in our
spectra, which are expected as a result of very recent event of
intense mass-loss. Computations show that the dust shell expan-
sion to produce excess emission at 60 µm will take about 104 yr
(de La Reza et al. 1996), which is consistent with the proposal
that mass-loss would have carried away most of the envelope’s
angular momentum and, eventually, slow down HD 16771 to the
observed value of v sini =2.8 km s−1 in the red-clump phase.
Along these lines we speculate that HD 16771 is in the cool ex-
tended dust shell and high lithium abundance phase of Siess &
Livio’s (1999) scenario.

Another signature of planet engulfment is the detection
of 9Be enrichment in stars. A search for beryllium enhance-
ments in a limited sample of Li-rich and Li-normal giants with
Teﬀ= 3900−4800 K and masses in the range 1.4-3.2 M(cid:12) pro-
vides no detection of the 9Be line at 3131 Å (Melo et al. 2005).
Although, the Be II line at 3131 Å falls outside our spectral
range to measure its abundance, its usefulness for deriving Be
abundances decreases with temperature below 5400 K to a point
where it will be useless (Santos et al. 2004). The source of diﬃ-
culty arises from the severe blending of Be line with other atomic
lines and their dominance at low temperatures around 3131 Å,
and the missing near-UV opacity which is not needed at the so-
lar eﬀective temperature (see Santos et al. 2004 and references
therein). Therefore, the Be abundance determinations requires
further scrutiny.

We note here that engulﬁng a putative close-in planet(s) with
an equivalent mass of 30 Jupiters (using equation 2 in Siess
& Livio 1999), whose atmosphere was hydrogen-poor (say by
about 1.5 dex) due to the evaporation of hydrogen atoms by
the sustainable radiation pressure from the host star (Alexander
1967; Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003), into a reasonable convective
envelope of 80% the mass of the red giant (Brown et al. 1989)
would raise the lithium abundance of HD 16771 to 2.8 dex and
the beryllium abundance by 1.0 dex without aﬀecting apprecia-
bly the abundances of other elements. The above calculations
are made for a giant star whose convective envelope is void of
both the lithium and beryllium abundances. However, the true
enhancement in the beryllium abundance would be much smaller
(about 0.4 dex if we assume a beryllium abundance of 0.8 dex on
the RGB) and probably undetectable because of severe blending

of Be line with other atomic lines and the diﬃculty in contin-
uum placement in those crowded regions of the spectra. Then a
prompt depletion of 6Li and a progressive dilution of 7Li would
naturally explain Li overabundance and IR excess in HD 16771
without any need for Cameron-Fowler mechanism. Therefore,
the absence/presence of 9Be overabundance in HD 16771 would
not necessarily contradict the engulfment scenario, as the close-
in planets are fated to undergo regular radiational harassment
from their host stars which would eventually evaporate hydro-
gen much faster than other elements (Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003;
Bourrier et al. 2014).

The puzzling overabundance of lithium in HD 16771 makes
it an oustanding prospect for future studies to set strong con-
straints on the role of planet engulfment and the episode of Li
synthesis for stars that neither experience LFB nor the He-core
ﬂash, and on the timescales for Li dilution, rotational spin-up
and spin-down of stars.
