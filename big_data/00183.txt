Abstract. In this paper, in the line of Aytar[1] and C¸ olak [2], we introduce the
notion of rough statistical convergence of order α in normed linear spaces and study
some properties of the set of all rough statistical limit points of order α.

Key words and phrases : Rough statistical convergence of order α, rough statistical

limit points of order α,

AMS subject classiﬁcation (2010) : 40A05, 40G99 .

1. Introduction:

The concept of statistical convergence was introduced by Steinhaus [9] and Fast [3]
and later it was reintroduced by Schoenberg [8] independently. Over the years a lot
of works have been done in this area. The concept of rough statistical convergence of
single sequences was ﬁrst introduced by S. Aytar [1]. Later the concept of statistical
convergence of order α was introduced by R. C¸ olak [2].

If x = {xn}n∈N is a sequence in some normed linear space (X, k . k) and r is a
nonnegative real number then x is said to rough statistical convergent to ξ ∈ X if for
any ε > 0,

n |{k ≤ n :k xk − ξ k≥ r + ε}| = 0, [1].

n→∞

For r = 0, rough statistical convergence coincides with statistical convergence.
In this paper following the line of Aytar [1] and C¸ olak [2] we introduce the notion
of rough statistical convergence of order α in normed linear spaces and prove some
properties of the set of all rough statistical limit points of order α.

2. Basic Deﬁnitions and Notations

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let K be a subset of the set of positive integers N. Let Kn = {k ∈
|Kn|
K : k ≤ n}. Then the natural density of K is given by lim
n , where |Kn| denotes
n→∞
the number of elements in Kn.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let K be a subset of the set of positive integers N and α be any real
number with 0 < α ≤ 1. Let Kn = {k ∈ K : k ≤ n}.Then the natural density of order
α of K is given by lim
n→∞

|Kn|
nα , where |Kn| denotes the number of elements in Kn.

Note 2.1. Let x = {xn}n∈N be a sequence. Then x satisﬁes some property P for all k
except a set whose natural density is zero. Then we say that the sequence x satisﬁes P
for almost all k and we abbreviated this by a.a.k.

Note 2.2. Let x = {xn}n∈N be a sequence. Then x satisﬁes some property P for all k
except a set whose natural density of order α is zero. Then we say that the sequence x
satisﬁes P for almost all k and we abbreviated this by a.a.k(α).

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let x = {xn}n∈N be a sequence in a normed linear space (X, k . k)
and r be a nonnegative real number. Let 0 < α ≤ 1 be given. Then x is said to be
st−rα
−→ ξ if for any ε > 0,
rough statistical convergent of order α to ξ ∈ X, denoted by x
nα |{k ≤ n :k xk − ξ k≥ r + ε}| = 0, that is a.a.k.(α) k xk − ξ k< r + ε for every
lim
n→∞
ε > 0 and some r > 0. In this case ξ is called a rα-st-limit of x.

The set of all rough statistical convergent sequences of order α will be denoted by

rSα for ﬁxed r with 0 < r ≤ 1.

Throughout this paper X will denote a normed linear space and r will denote a

nonnegative real number and x will denote the sequence x = {xn}n∈N in X.

In general, the rα-st-limit point of a sequence may not be unique. So we consider
st−rα
−→ ξ}.

The sequence x is said to be rα-statistical convergent provided that st-LIM rα
For unbounded sequence rough limit set LIM r
But in case of rough statistical convergence of order α st-LIM rα
sequence is unbounded. For this we consider the following example.

x 6= ∅.

Example 2.1. Let X = R. We deﬁne a sequence in the following way,

xn = (−1)n : i 6= n2, α = 1

= n, otherwise

Then

st-LIM rα

x

= ∅, if r < 1
= [1 − r, r − 1], otherwise.

and LIM rα

x = ∅ for all r ≥ 0.

Deﬁnition 2.4. A sequence {xn}n∈N is said to be statistically bounded if there exists
a positive real number M such that lim
n→∞

n |{k ≤ n :k xk k≥ M }| = 0

3. Main Results

Theorem 3.1. Let x be a sequence in X. Then x is statistically bounded of order α if
and only if there exists a nonnegative real number r such that st-LIM rα

x 6= ∅.

Proof. The condition is necessary.

Since the sequence x is statistically bounded, there exists a positive real number M

Choose j ∈ {k ≤ n :k xk − yk0 k< r + ε

k xj − y∗ k≤k xj − yk0 k + k yk0 − y∗ k< r + ε which implies j ∈ {k ≤ n :k xk − y∗ k<

From (1) we can say that the set on the right hand side of(2) has natural density 1.
Then the set on the left hand side of (2) must have natural density 1. Hence we get

This completes the proof.

Theorem 3.5. Let x be a sequence in X and r > 0. Then the sequence x is rough
statistical convergent of order α to ξ ∈ X if and only if there exists a sequence y =
{yn}n∈N in X such that y is statistically convergent of order α to ξ and k xn − yn k≤ r
for all n ∈ N.

Proof. The condition is necessary.

Let xn

nα |{k ≤ n :k xk − ξ k≥ r + ε}| = 0 for some r > 0.

Then we can write

k yn − ξ k = 0, if k xn − ξ k≤ r

= k xn − ξ k −r, otherwise

and by deﬁnition of yn, we have k xn − yn k≤ r for all n ∈ N. Hence by (3) and the
nα |{k ≤ n :k yk − ξ k≥ ε}| = 0. Which implies that the
deﬁnition of yn we get lim
n→∞
sequence {yn}n∈N is statistically covergent of order α to ξ.

The condition is suﬃcient.

Since {yn}n∈N is statistically convergent of order α to ξ, we have

1

nα |{k ≤ n :k yk − ξ k≥ ε}| = 0 for all ε > 0. Also since for a given r > 0 and for
lim
n→∞
the sequence x = {xn}n∈N k xn − yn k< r, the inclusion {k ≤ n :k xk − ξ k≥ r + ε} ⊆
{k ≤ n :k yk − ξ k≥ ε} holds. Hence we get lim
n→∞
This completes the proof.

nα |{k ≤ n :k xk − ξ k≥ r + ε}| = 0.

Theorem 3.6. For an arbitrary c ∈ Γx, where Γx is the set of all rough statistical
cluster points of a sequence x ∈ X, we have for a positive real number r, k ξ − c k≤ r
for all ξ ∈ st-LIM rα
x .

Proof. Let 0 < α ≤ 1 be given. On the contrary let assume that there exists a point
c ∈ Γx and ξ ∈ st-LIM rα

such that k ξ − c k> r. Choose ε = kξ−ck−r

. Then

x

{k ≤ n :k xk − ξ k≥ r + ε} ⊇ {k ≤ n :k xk − c k< ε}

n→∞

nα |{k ≤ n :k xk − c k< ε}| 6= 0. Hence by (4)
nα |{k ≤ n :k xk − ξ k< r + ε}| 6= 0. This is a contradictin to the fact
(cid:3)

we have lim

ξ ∈ st-LIM rα

Theorem 3.7. Let x be sequence in the strictly convex space. Let r and α be two
positive real numbers. If for any y1, y2 ∈ st-LIM rα
x with k y1 − y2 k= 2r, then x is
statistically convergent of order α to y1+y2

Proof. Let z ∈ Γx. Then for any y1, y2 ∈ st − LIM rα

x

implies

k y1 − z k≤ r and k y2 − z k≤ r.

On the other hand we have

2r =k y1 − y2 k≤k y1 − z k + k y2 − z k .

Hence by (5) and (6) we get k y1 − z k=k y2 − z k= r. Since

[(z − y1) + (y2 − z)]

2 (y1 − y2) = z − y1 = y2 − z, which implies that z = 1

and k y1 − y2 k= 2r, we get k 1
2 (y2 − y1) k= r. By strict convexity of the space and from
the equality(7) we get 1
2 (y1 + y2).
Hence z is unique statistical cluster point of the sequence x. On the other hand, from
the assumption y1, y2 ∈ st-LIM rα
x 6= ∅. So by Theorem 3.1 the
x
sequence x is statistically bounded of order α. Since z is the unique statistical cluster
point ot the statistically bounded sequence x of order α we have the sequence x is
statistically convergent to z = 1
(cid:3)

implies that st-LIM rα

Theorem 3.8. Let 0 < α ≤ 1 and x and y be two sequences. Then
(i) if rα-st- lim x = x0 and c ∈ R, then rα-st- lim cx = cx0
(ii)if rα-st- lim x = x0 and rα-st- lim y = y0 then rα-st- lim(x + y) = x0 + y0.

Proof. (i) If c = 0 it is trivial. Suppose that c 6= 0. Then the proof of (i) follows from
nα |{k ≤ n :k cxk − cx0 k≥ r + ε}| ≤ 1

nα |{k ≤ n :k

It is easy to see that every convergent sequence is rough statistical convergent of

order α, but the converse is not true always.

Example 3.1. Let us consider the following sequence of real numbers deﬁned by,

xk = 1, if k = n3
= 0, otherwise

Then it is easy to see that the sequence is rough statistical convergent of order α with
rSα- lim xk = 0 for α > 1

3 , but it is not a convergent sequence.

Theorem 3.9. Let 0 < α ≤ β ≤ 1. Then rSα ⊆ rSβ, where rSα and rSβ denote the
set of all rough statistical convergent sequence of order α and β respectively.

Proof. If 0 < α ≤ β ≤ 1 then

nβ |{k ≤ n :k xk − l k≥ r + ε}| ≤

nα |{k ≤ n :k xk − l k≥ r + ε}|

for every ε > 0 and some r > 0 with limit l.
Clearly this shows that rSα ⊆ rSβ.

(cid:3)

We do not know whether for a sequence x in X, r > 0 and for 0 < α < 1,

diam(st-LIM rα

x ) ≤ 2r is true or not.

So we leave this above fact as an open problem.

Open Problem 3.1. Is it true for a sequence x in X, r > 0 and 0 < α < 1,
diam(st-LIM rα

x ) ≤ 2r.
