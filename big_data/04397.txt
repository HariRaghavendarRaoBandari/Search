Optically generated electron-hole plasma in high-index dielectric nanostructures was demonstrated
as a means of tuning of their optical properties. However, until now an ultrafast operation regime
of such plasma driven nanostructures has not been attained. Here, we perform pump-probe exper-
iments with resonant silicon nanoparticles and report on dense optical plasma generation near the
magnetic dipole resonance with ultrafast (about 2.5 ps) relaxation rate. Basing on experimental
results, we develop an analytical model describing transient response of a nanocrystalline silicon
nanoparticle to an intense laser pulse and show theoretically that plasma induced optical nonlin-
earity leads to ultrafast reconﬁguration of the scattering power pattern. We demonstrate 100 fs
switching to unidirectional scattering regime upon irradiation of the nanoparticle by an intense fem-
tosecond pulse. Our work lays the foundation for developing ultracompact and ultrafast all-optical
signal processing devices.

INTRODUCTION

Silicon presents a versatile and low-cost platform for
data processing at speeds of 100 Gbit/s and beyond.1
This is possible thanks to a broad range of inherent opti-
cal nonlinearities such as stimulated Raman scattering,2
Kerr eﬀect,3 two-photon absorption,4 thermo-optical
eﬀect,5 and electron-hole plasma (EHP) generation.6
However, the relatively large size of such devices and their
high power consumption have remained an obstacle.

Miniaturization of an optical device is possible with
use of high-index dielectric (including silicon) nanopar-
ticles which due to their Mie resonances enhance light-
matter interaction at the nanoscale.7–13 Recently, such
all-dielectric nanostructures have been studied in the con-
text of huge enhancement of optical nonlinearities.14–18
The ability to control the scattering behavior of nanopar-
ticles via nonlinear eﬀects may open unique opportunities
for eﬀective light manipulation by using only a single di-
electric nanoparticle.

The choice of optical nonlinearity for data process-
ing is an important factor, which determines the ulti-
mate performance of a photonic device. Refractive in-
dex change induced by EHP nonlinearity can be signif-
icantly larger than that of Kerr nonlinearity,1 avoiding
the necessity to use high-Q large resonators and pho-
tonic crystals. The generation of EHP was employed
for tuning of silicon nanoantenna optical properties in
the IR and visible regions.15,16 However, in contrast to
the instantaneous Kerr mechanism, EHP relaxation pro-
cess at low-intensity photoexcitation is relatively slow
(tens-hundreds of picoseconds), being comparable with
the fastest electronic devices. Such slow EHP relaxation
in silicon-based nanoantennas was demonstrated in pre-
vious studies,17,18 where ultrafast (sub-picosecond) re-
conﬁguration of resonant silicon (Si) nanoparticles was
achieved only via relatively weak Kerr-type optical non-

linearity. Therefore, for achieving eﬀective all-optical sig-
nal processing by means of a single dielectric nanoparti-
cle, two basic problems should be solved: (i) achieving of
a few picosecond time of EHP relaxation, and (ii) opti-
mization of the modulation depth and time of switching.
In this Paper, we report on experimental observation
of ∼2.5 ps operation regime of a nonlinear all-dielectric
nanoantenna, which is one order of magnitude faster than
previously reported for resonant Si nanoparticles. Bas-
ing on the pump-probe experiments, we build an ana-
lytical model describing the transient dynamics of opti-
cal scattering on a dielectric nanoparticle with magnetic
and electric optical responses. The developed model al-
lows us to analyze the excitation and radiation of the

which usually results in the formation of completely
amorphous Si:H material with typical broad maximum
at 480 cm−1 in Raman spectrum [Fig. 2(b), black curve].
However, at the ﬁnal stage of the lithographical pro-
cedure the resulting nanoparticles represent partially
recrystallized state with the narrow Raman peak at
501 cm−1 with asymmetric shape caused by inﬂuence
of the remain amorphous component19 [Fig. 2(b), red
curve]. According to our Raman micro-spectroscopy
measurements (for details see Supplementary materials),
the amount of crystalline fracture Ic/(Ic + Ia) is about
0.45, where Ic and Ia are the integrated intensities of the
crystalline and amorphous phases. The partial recrystal-
lization of initially amorphous Si:H ﬁlm is supposed to be
caused by electron-beam processing step with 25 kV ac-
celeration voltage.20 The resulting pertially recrystalized
material has average grain size about d ≈ 2 nm, according

to the expression d = 2π(cid:112)B/∆ω, where ∆ω is the peak

changes at high laser intensity were performed for test-
ing the nonlinear properties of the nanoparticles. The
experimental results are presented in Fig. 3(a), where
the relative transmittance change ∆T /T0 of the probe
beam through the array is shown as a function of the de-
lay between two pulses ∆τ with respect to the pump
beam. Pulse duration of the pump beam is 220 fs,
intensity is 200±100 GW/cm2, and repetition rate is
1 kHz. This measurement at the highest possible inten-
sity in the non-damage regime provides us the informa-
tion on EHP relaxation time. Fitting the transmission
transient in Fig. 3(a) results preferably in decay time
of ≈ 2.5 ± 0.5 ps. Relatively small values of modula-
tion depth is described by slight mismatching of pump
and probe beam on 15×15 µm2 nanoparticle array. We
did not observe sharp two-photon absorption peak re-
ported previously,17,18 probably, due to crossed polariza-
tions of the pump and probe pulses excluding any in-
terference eﬀects. Nevertheless, the observed value of
2.5 ps is the smallest observed for EHP decay in silicon-
based resonant nanoparticles, compared to ≈30 ps17 and
≈25 ps18 [Fig. 3(b)]. The comparison of the results for
the nanoparticles with those for bulk amorphous and
nanocrystalline silicon phases is given in Supplementary
materials.

III. ANALYTICAL THEORY

Now we derive the master equations describing tem-
poral response of a Si nanoparticle exposed to a short
optical pulse. We model a spherical nanoparticle as a
combination of electric (p) and magnetic (m) dipoles
which are related to incident monochomatic electromag-
netic ﬁelds via p = αeE and m = αmH. The correspond-

electric and magnetic dipole modes in strongly nonlinear
regime of EHP generation and ultrafast relaxation.
In
particular, we describe reconﬁguration of radiation pat-
tern during the pulse action from dipole-like to unidi-
rectional regime mediated by generation of EHP in the
nanoparticle, schematically shown in Fig. 1.

II. PUMP-PROBE MEASUREMENTS

In order to demonstrate the regime of ultrafast sil-
icon nanoantenna operation, we performed a series
of pump-probe experiments with an array of silicon
nanoparticles supporting magnetic optical response. The
cylindrical nanoparticles have bottom/top diameters of
140 nm/40 nm, a height of 220 nm, and a period of
600 nm. Results of linear optical measurements [see
Fig. 2(a)] show pronounced resonance near 500 nm which
is attributed to magnetic dipole Mie resonance of a sin-
gle nanoparticle. The resonance response is conﬁrmed by
our numerical modeling in CST Microwave Studio, re-
vealing typical ring-like electric ﬁeld distribution within
the nanoparticle [see inset in Fig. 2(a)].

The nanoparticles were fabricated by means of plasma-
enhanced chemical vapour deposition in SH3 atmosphere,

The above equations fully describe dynamics of the
electric and magnetic dipole moments provided that
EHP density, which determines dipole polarizabilities, is
known at all times. However, in our case the ﬁeld inten-
sity itself describes EHP generation, which we address
below.

In order to describe dynamics of laser induced EHP,
we employ the rate equation which can be found in
literature.24–26 For the sake of simplicity, we will de-
scribe volume averaged concentration ρeh(t) neglecting
its spatial distribution and therefore diﬀusion of car-
riers across the particle volume.
Indeed, at ρeh >
1020 cm−3 thermal velocity of hot free electrons is about
ve ≈ 5 × 105 cm/s,27 whereas corresponding electron-
electron scattering time is about ∼100 fs. Tacking into
account, the ring-like magnetic dipole mode structure,
the characteristic EHP homogenisation time governed
by a ballistic motion of electrons can be estimated as
τhom ∼ R/2ve ∼ 100 fs, where R is the nanoparticles
radius. We also ignore thermal eﬀects, because of their
negligible inﬂuence on epsilon at ps-timescale under non-
damage irradiation conditions.

The rate equation for EHP therefore takes the form

˜E (t) and ˜H (t) denote slowly varying amplitudes of elec-

moments read p (t) = ˜p (t) exp (−iω0t) and m (t) =

material.29 Therefore the resulting relaxation rate is rep-
resented via following terms: ΓTR = 1.5 · 1011 s−1
(Ref.22), ΓBM = 1.1 · 10−10 ρeh cm3s−1 (Ref.22) and
ΓA = 4 · 10−31 ρ2
eh s−1 (Ref.29). The resulting depen-
dence of relaxation time on EHP density is shown in
Fig. 3(c), demonstrating good agreement with the ex-
perimental values.

The last essential element of our dynamical model is
the expression relating permittivity of excited silicon ε
to EHP density ρeh. Generally, this dependence is repre-
sented as a following expression:16,25

ε (ω, ρeh) = εSi + ∆εbgr + ∆εbf + ∆εD

(3)

where εSi
is the permittivity of non-excited material,
whereas ∆εbgr, ∆εbf, and ∆εD are the contributions
from band gap renormalization, band ﬁlling, and Drude
term. The Drude contribution strongly dominates the
others in the IR range and at relatively low intensities.1
Band ﬁlling is important when EHP density becomes
comparable with the capacity of the conduction band
(ρeh > 1020 cm−3). Band gap renormalization plays sig-
niﬁcant role at wavelengths where permittivity dispersion
dε/dω is considerable (< 800 nm for Si). The detailed
expressions for all contributions in Eq. (3) are given in
Supplementary materials.

In the simulations, ε(ρeh) becomes time-dependent and
determines inverse dipole polarizabilities entering elec-
tromagnetic part of our model, Eq. (1). The system of
equations (1) and (2) allow to completely determine tran-
sient behavior of a silicon nanoparticle under action of an
intense optical pulse of an arbitrary shape.

IV. RESULTS

We now apply our model to study the interplay of ex-
cited electric and magnetic dipoles, leading to directional
scattering.30 We illustrate the dynamical reconﬁguration
of the scattering pattern for the R = 75 nm radius sil-
icon particle in air. The particle is driven by a Gaus-
sian pulse at wavelength λ = 600 nm which is tuned

to magnetic dipole resonance, where β of silicon has the
highest values,28 allowing to reduce incident pulse inten-
sity. In Fig. 4 we present detailed transient optical re-
sponse for a few peak incident intensities I0 determined
as I0 = (c/8π)|E|2. Pulse duration is taken as τ = 200 fs,
pulse center position is t0 = 400 fs.

dip near the pulse center around t = 500 ps, where
EHP density is maximal. Electric dipole (ED) and mag-
netic dipole (MD) phases for the largest peak intensity
(I0 = 40 GW/cm2) are shown in Fig. 4(b). The phase
of MD abruptly jumps around the pulse center in such a
way so that ED and MD oscillate almost in phase. The
corresponding MD and ED amplitudes are shown in the
inset in Fig. 4(b). While the ED amplitude smoothly
follows the incident pulse shape, the MD amplitude also
experiences sharp change at the pulse maximum. At this
moment, due to large EHP density the particle is detuned
from the MD resonance condition, resulting in abrupt de-
crease of the MD amplitude. At this point transition to
unidirectional scattering during the rest of the pulse may
be expected.

In order to address radiation directivity evolution, we
calculate the angular emitted power distribution created
by perpendicular electric and magnetic dipoles in E- and
H-plane as8

SE (θ) = | ˜m + ˜p cos θ|2, SH (θ) = |˜p + ˜m cos θ|2,

with θ = 0 being the forward direction and θ = π back-
ward direction. Fig. 4(c) shows the Front-to-Back ratio
(FBR) deﬁned as FBR = SE (0)
SE (π) as well as the scattering
power patterns for the largest pulse intensity before and
after the pulse center arrival.
In the regime of weak intensity (I0 ∼ 10 GW/cm2)
EHP density is not enough to cause signiﬁcant refractive
index change, so that scattering is dominated by mag-
netic dipole excitation with low FBR. However, as the
pulse intensity increases, EHP creates larger refractive
index change. As a result, MD resonance shifts to shorter
wavelengths causing signiﬁcant decrease of the magnetic

dipole resonance is barely aﬀected by EHP-induced re-
fractive index change. This results in a Huygens-like be-
havior with FBR as high as 100 for 40 GW/cm2 incident
pulse, Fig. 4(c).
Remarkably,

switching to unidirectional Huygens
regime under irradiation by a strong pulse occurs at 100 fs
scale time, Fig. 4(c). Such fast reconﬁguration occurs
due to intense EHP generation via two-photon absorp-
tion, whose rate scales quadratically with I0. In order to
quantitatively describe this feature of transient nanopar-
ticle response, we introduce the switching time τswitch
as the minimal duration of a Gaussian pulse with given
peak intensity I0 required to achieve FBR = 5 during the
pulse action.

This switching time τswitch is shown in Fig. 5(a) as a
function of peak intensity and excitation wavelength as-
suming that nanoparticle radius obeys the MD resonance
conﬁguration with τswitch ≤ 100 fs can be achieved in
the wavelength range 550 − 650 nm where high one- and
two-photon absorption in silicon enables dense enough
EHP generation at the ultrashort time scale (see Supple-
mantary material for a 2D plot of EHP density). It also
shows that the switching time gradually reduces with in-
creasing wavelength in the IR despite very low one- and
two-photon absorption of Si in this range. This occurs
due to λ2 scaling of Drude contribution to the permittiv-
ity of photoexcited silicon.

Required intensity and pulse duration depend on the
value of desired FBR of a silicon nanoparticle in the
switched state. In the regime of exact Huygens source,
when αe = αm, backward scattering cancels completely,
but it would require larger ﬂuences. However, ﬁnite-FBR
although highly directional regimes can be obtained at
lower EHP densities and therefore smaller ﬂuence.
In
Fig. 5(b) we show the switching intensity assuming con-
stant 200 fs pulse duration for a series of desired FBR
values. We also derive a useful analytical estimation of

switching intensity for inﬁnitely large FBR (see Supple-
mentary materials):

The estimated value of switching intensity reduces with
increasing Imχ(3) and Re (εSi). Therefore, using high-
index dielectrics with high third-order nonlinearity is
preferable for the optical switching. Particularly, as
Fig. 5(a) suggests, a laser pulse with λ = 550–700 nm
and I0 > 15 GW/cm2 is the most optimal for the ultra-
fast reconﬁguration of the nc-Si nanoantenna.
In practice, achieving of FBR=∞ is not necessary,
whereas FBR=3–5 is suﬃcient for signiﬁcant change of
the transmitted optical signal through the nanoswitch,
yielding relatively low range of
incident intensities
I0 = 15–60 GW/cm2 at λ = 500–1500 nm [see Fig. 5(b)].
Particularly, at I0 = 15 GW/cm2, λ = 550–700 nm,
τ = 100 fs, and realistic focal spot area ≈ 1 µm2, 15 pJ
pulse is suﬃcient for considerable switching (FRB≈3) at
the ultrafast time. Such energy and intensity levels are
far below the damage threshold of Si (Idamage ∼ 102–
103 GW/cm2, Refs.16,17) for such type of nanoparticles.
Interestingly, our simple expression for Iswitch gives the
same ∼ τ−1/2 scaling as the damage threshold Idamage ∼
τ−1/2.31 Therefore, the ratio Iswitch/Idamage is approx-
imately constant in a broad range of pulse durations,
simplifying the system optimization.

In order to evaluate the ultimate performance of the
proposed nanostructure, we note that its bandwith is
mainly limited by reverse switching from the photoex-
cited unidirectional state to dipole-like one during the
EHP relaxation. Numerical simulations indicate that
such switching from FBR = 3 to its initial state occurs
during approximately 4 ps yielding the maximum band-
width of about 250 Gbit/s. Our pump-probe measure-
ments conﬁrm the possibility of device operation at this
speed.

To summarize, we have shown that generation and
relaxation of EHP in a silicon nanoparticle under non-
damage regime of photoexcitation can be as fast as 2.5 ps,
being promising for ultrafast all-optical data processing.
Basing on the developed model, we have analyzed tran-
sient optical dynamics of the nanoparticle, demonstart-
ing accelerated scattering pattern reconﬁguration from
a dipole-like to a Huygens element-like pattern during
laser-nanoantenna interaction. Our results provide a gen-
eral strategy for the experimental parameters optimiza-
tion for achieving eﬀective all-optical signal processing
by using a single dielectric nanoparticle.
(i) The ma-
terial should have high third order nonlinearity and re-
fractive index at pump wavelength; (ii) Provided that (i)
is satisﬁed, longer wavelengths of the signal are prefer-
able; (iii) The use of nanocrystalline or amorphous state
is favorable due to faster relaxation rate as compared to

6

pure crystalline state; (iv) Irradiation in the vicinity of
the Kerker condition gives the most dramatic change of
the scattering properties. We envision that the proposed
approach for ultrafast tuning of Huygens source will be
useful for the development of novel ultrafast nonlinear
optical nanodevices, where interplay between electric and
magnetic modes plays the crucial role in scattering be-
havior.

Calculation of the one- and two-photon absorption rates W1,2 requires knowing of the electric ﬁeld value averaged

over the nanoparticle volume,

and

. We should relate these values to the instantaneous amplitudes of

electric and magnetic dipole moments, whose dynamics is governed by Eq. (1) in the main text. To do that, we assume
that at each moment electric ﬁeld inside the particle can be represented as a sum of electric dipole and magnetic
dipole modes:

(cid:35)

The values AMD and AED are found by integrating the near-ﬁeld current of the ﬁeld distribution E and equating

the resulting dipole moments to known values of ˜p and ˜m:

Now, volume-averaged electric ﬁeld can be directly calculated by integrating expression (1) over the nanoparticle

where the above mentioned ρeh-dependent bandgap shrinkage eﬀect on interband transitions is accounted by in-
troducing eﬀective photon frequency ω∗ = ω + Θρeh/ρbgr. Here, the characteristic renormalization EHP density
ρbgr ≈ 1 × 1022 cm−3, the factor Θ is typically about 5% of the total valence electron density (≈ 2×1023 cm−3 in
Si) to provide the ultimate 50% electronic direct bandgap renormalization, i.e., ¯hΘ ≈ 1.7 eV of the eﬀective minimal
gap ≈ 3.4 eV in silicon, and ρbf is the characteristic band capacity of the speciﬁc photo-excited regions of the ﬁrst
Brillouine zone in the k-space (e.g., ρbf (L) ≈ 4 × 1021 cm−3 for L-valleys and ρbf (X) ≈ 4.5 × 1022 cm−3 for X-valleys
in Si), aﬀecting interband transitions via the band-ﬁlling eﬀectS1. The bulk EHP frequency ωpl is deﬁned as

the screening density ρscr ≈ 1 × 1021 cm−3 was chosen to provide εhf → 1 in dense EHP. The electronic damping
time τe in the regime of dense EHP at the probe frequency ωpr was taken, similarly to metals, in the random phase
approximation as proportional to the inverse bulk EHP frequency ω−1
pl . Here, τe is evaluated for ¯hω > kBTe in the
form τe(ρeh) ≈ 3 × 102/(ωpl(ρeh)), accounting multiple carrier scattering paths for the three top valence sub-bands,
and multiple X-valleys in the lowest conduction band of silicon.

III. OPTICAL CHARACTERISATION

The broadband spectral measurements of the reﬂected signal from a single nanoparticle (Rs) were carried out by
means of strong focusing and collection of light (λ=400–900 nm) to a spectrometer (Horiba LabRam HR) through an
achromatic objective with a numerical aperture NA=0.95.

Raman scattering data were measured by a micro-Raman apparatus (Raman spectrometer HORIBA LabRam HR,
AIST SmartSPM system). As a source 632.8-nm HeNe laser were used. The Raman spectra were recorded through
the 100× microscope objective (NA=0.9) and projected onto a thermoelectrically cooled charge-coupled device (CCD,
Andor DU 420A-OE 325) with a 600-g/mm diﬀraction grating. Individual nanoparticle spectrum was recorded by a
commercial spectrometer (Horiba LabRam HR) when the nanoparticle was precisely places (accuracy about 100 nm)
in the center of the laser beam (0.86-µm diameter) focused on the substrate.

IV. TIME-DOMAIN TRANSMITTANCE MEASUREMENTS

We exploit a laser pulses at 515 nm wavelength and 1 kHz repetition rate, which are split by two pulses with
orthogonal linear polarizations and have 10-times diﬀerence between their intensities. Maximum energy of the pump
pulse in non-damage regime is about 10 nJ. The pulses are focused by a NA=0.25 objective onto the nanoparticles
array, providing focused laser spot size of about r1/e ≈ 2.5 µm. The energy of the transmitted probe pulse is measured
by a GaP photodetector, whereas the pump pulse is ﬁltered by a polarizer.

V. RECOMBINATION

For silicon, the carrier trapping (ΓTR) on point defectsS3 and self-trappingS4 is well known to be the dominating
mechanism at low EHP densities (< 1020 cm−3) and low crystallinity. So-called bi-molecular (ΓBM) non-radiative and
radiative recombination (both resonant and non-resonant) processes govern relaxation dynamics mostly in amorphous

VII. ESTIMATION OF SWITCHING INTENSITY

√

(cid:46)

Developed theory allows us to obtain an evaluation of the threshold pulse intensity Iswitch necessary for transition
to the unidirectional scattering regime. Assume that pulse wavelength λ is tuned to the magnetic dipole resonance
of unexcited particle. The ﬁrst Kerker condition, when αe = αm, is satisﬁed at λKerker ≈ 2.2R
S14. Given the
constant excitation wavelength, we conclude that refractive index of the photoexcited silicon should be decreased

by 10% to achieve the Kerker’s condition: δn ≈ −0.1n, δε = δ(cid:0)n2(cid:1) ≈ −0.2ε0. The main contribution to modiﬁed

opt ≈ 0.18me and high-frequency electronic dielectric constant εhf → 1 in dense
To estimate peak EHP density ρ0 created by the incident pulse, we note that during a typical 100 − 200 fs pulse
duration EHP relaxation can be neglected as it occurs on a ps scale. Further, we notice that two-photon absorption is
more eﬃcient at characteristic intensities required for activation of Huygens regime. Therefore we integrate the EHP
rate equation (Eq. (2) of the main text) and estimate peak EHP density as ρ0 ≈ τ
16π¯h Im χ(3)|Ein|4. Finally, recalling
that at magnetic dipole resonance αm = 3i
2k3 , and that electric ﬁeld inside the particle is enhanced by a factor of
F ∼ 6αm/(kR4ε), we substitute this formula into expression for δε and arrive at the desired evaluation of threshold
intensity:
