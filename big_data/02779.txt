Spherical averages in the space of marked lattices

Jens Marklof∗

Ilya Vinogradov†

March 10, 2016

Abstract

A marked lattice is a d-dimensional Euclidean lattice, where each lattice point is
assigned a mark via a given random ﬁeld on Zd. We prove that, if the ﬁeld is strongly
mixing with a faster-than-logarithmic rate, then for every given lattice and almost every
marking, large spheres become equidistributed in the space of marked lattices. A key
aspect of our study is that the space of marked lattices is not a homogeneous space,
but rather a non-trivial ﬁber bundle over such a space. As an application, we prove
that the free path length in a crystal with random defects has a limiting distribution
in the Boltzmann-Grad limit.

Introduction

Consider a Lie group G, a non-compact one-parameter subgroup ΦR and a compact sub-
group K. Let λ be a probability measure on K that is absolutely continuous with respect
to Haar measure on K. Given a measure-preserving action G × X → X, (g, x) 7→ xg on a
probability space (X, A , µ), it is natural to ask under which conditions the “spherical” aver-

age Pt deﬁned by Ptf :=RK f (x0kΦt)dλ(k) converges weakly to µ, or any other probability

measure. In general the best one can hope for is convergence for µ-almost all x0. Proofs
typically require an additional average over Φt, and may be viewed as generalizations of the
classic Wiener ergodic theorem; see Nevo’s survey [21] and references therein. If the space
X is homogeneous, then the weak convergence of the spherical average Pt can be proved
for all x0, with a complete classiﬁcation of all limit measures, by means of measure rigidity
techniques that are based on Ratner’s measure classiﬁcation theorem for subgroups gener-
ated by unipotent elements [22]. There is now a large body of literature on this topic, see
for instance [24, 8, 7, 16, 17, 19]. In some settings, spherical equidistribution may also be
deduced directly from the mixing property of ΦR [10]. The ﬁrst example of spherical equidis-
tribution in the non-homogeneous setting for all (and not just almost all) x0 is given in [9],
where the analogue of Ratner’s theorem is proved for the moduli space of branched covers
of Veech surfaces, which is a ﬁber bundle over a homogeneous space. A major advance in

this direction is the recent work by Eskin and Mirzakhani [11] and Eskin, Mirzakhani and
Mohammadi [12], who prove a Ratner-like classiﬁcation of measures in the moduli space of
ﬂat surfaces that are invariant under the upper triangular subgroup of SL(2, R). This is used
to prove convergence of spherical averages in that moduli space, with an additional t average
as above, which yields an averaged counting asymptotics for periodic trajectories in general
rational billiards.

The goal of the present study is to construct a natural example of a non-homogeneous
space (the space of marked Euclidean lattices), which is a ﬁber bundle over a homogeneous
space (the space of Euclidean lattices), and to prove spherical equidistribution for every
point in the base and almost every point in the ﬁber. Our ﬁndings complement a theorem
of Brettschneider [3, Theorem 4.7], who proves uniform convergence of Birkhoﬀ averages for
ﬁber bundles with uniquely ergodic base under technical assumptions on the test function
and ﬁber transformation.

This paper is organized as follows. We introduce the space of lattices in Section 2, then
the space of marked lattices in Section 3, where the marking is produced by a random ﬁeld
on Zd. The main results of this study, limit theorems for spherical averages in the space of
marked lattices, are stated and proved in Section 4 and 5. The former deals with convergence
on average over the ﬁeld, the latter with a ﬁxed realization of the random ﬁeld. Section 6
applies these results to the setting of defect lattices, where lattice points are either randomly
removed, or shifted from their equilibrium position. Section 7 explains how these ﬁndings can
be used to calculate the limit distribution for the free paths lengths in the Boltzmann-Grad
limit of a Lorentz gas for such scatterer conﬁgurations.

2 Spherical averages in the space of lattices

Let G0 = SL(d, R) and let Γ0 = SL(d, Z). We represent elements in Rd as row vectors,

and deﬁne a natural action of G0 on Rd by right matrix multiplication. The map

Γ0M 7→ ZdM

(2.1)

gives a one-to-one correspondence between the homogeneous space Γ0\G0 and the space of
Euclidean lattices in Rd of covolume one. The Haar measure µ0 on G0 is normalized, so that
it projects to a probability measure on Γ0\G0 which will also be denoted by µ0.

Let G = G0 ⋉ Rd be the semidirect product with multiplication law

(2.2)
where ξ, ξ′ are viewed as row vectors. The group G is a bundle over G0 with ﬁber Rd. The
subgroup Γ = Γ0 ⋉ Zd is a lattice in G. The Haar measure on G is µ = µ0 × LebRd. It induces

(M, ξ)(M ′, ξ′) = (MM ′, ξM ′ + ξ′)

2

a probability measure on Γ\G which will also be denoted by µ. The groups G0 and G act on
Rd by linear and aﬃne transformations, respectively, which are given by

and

Rd x G0
(v, g) 7→ vg

Zd x Γ0
(v, g) 7→ vg

Rd x G

(v, (M, ξ)) 7→ vM + ξ =: v(M, ξ),

Zd x Γ

(v, (M, ξ)) 7→ vM + ξ = v(M, ξ),

(2.3)
(2.4)

(2.5)
(2.6)

where concatenation denotes matrix multiplication. We embed G0 ֒→ G by M 7→ (M, 0),
and identify G0 with its image under this embedding.

As in the linear case, the map

Γg 7→ Zdg

(2.7)

gives a one-to-one correspondence between the homogeneous space Γ\G and the space of
aﬃne Euclidean lattices in Rd of covolume one.

We will need other subgroups of G in addition to G0. For ξ ∈ Rd, put

Gξ =(G

(1, ξ)G0(1, ξ)−1

if ξ ∈ Rd \ Qd,
if ξ ∈ Qd.

(2.8)

The subgroup Γξ = Γ ∩ Gξ is a lattice in Gξ. We denote by µξ be the Haar measure on Gξ,
normalized so that a fundamental domain of the Γξ-action in Gξ has measure 1. We denote
the induced probability measure on Γξ\Gξ also by µξ. When ξ /∈ Qd, we put Γξ = Γ and
µξ = µ. Thus, when ξ ∈ Qd, µξ can be identiﬁed with a singular measure on Γ\G supported
on the closed subspace Γ\ΓGξ ≃ Γξ\Gξ of X. Deﬁne the translate

Xξ := Γ\ΓGξ(1, ξ),

(2.9)

again a closed subspace of X, which we equip with the subspace topology. Note that Xξ =

Γ\Γ(1, ξ)G0. The measure eµξ on Xξ deﬁned as the translate of µξ,

eµξA = µξ(A(1, ξ)−1)

(2.10)

(2.11)

for any Borel set A ⊂ Xξ. For t ∈ R and u ∈ U ⊂ Rd−1, with U open and bounded, deﬁne
the matrices

, u 7→ e1R(u)−1, where e1 is the ﬁrst standard basis vector, is a diﬀeo-
morphism onto its image if U is suﬃciently small; cf. Remark 5.5 in [17]. More generally, we
can take any smooth map E : U → SO(d) such that

following that the closure of eE(U) is contained in the hemisphere {v ∈ Sd−1

For a given absolutely continuous probability measure λ on U, t > 0 and ξ ∈ Rd, M ∈ G0,

and that Leb(U. ) = 0.

Ptf =Z f dPt = Zu∈U

f (Γ(1, ξ)ME(u)Φt)λ(du)

(2.13)

for any bounded continuous f : Xξ → R. Note that the restriction to maps E : U → SO(d) is
purely for technical convenience. There is no loss of generality, since M is arbitrary and the
maps U 7→ Sd−1
, u 7→ e1E(u)−1M −1 cover the sphere for ﬁnitely many choices of M ∈ SO(d);
cf. [17].

Theorem 2.1 ([17, Sec. 5]). For t → ∞,

Recall the above weak convergence means that for every bounded continuous f : Xξ → R,

limt→∞ Ptf =eµξf .

We will now show how the space of lattices can be viewed as a subspace of the space of
point processes in Rd. The extension of this to marked point processes will be a key element
in this paper.

Let M(Rd) be the space of locally ﬁnite Borel measures on Rn, equipped with the vague

topology. The vague topology is the smallest topology such that the function

(2.14)

bf : M(Rd) → R,

µ 7→ µf

(2.15)

is continuous for every f ∈ Cc(Rd) (the space of continuous functions Rd → R with compact
support). The space M(Rd) is Polish in this topology [13, Theorem A 2.3]. We embed the
space of aﬃne lattices in M(Rd) by the map

ι : X → M(Rd),

x 7→ Xy∈Zdx

δy.

(2.16)

For technical reasons (which will become clear in Corollary 2.4) we will need to treat the
space of lattices X0 slightly diﬀerently; deﬁne

ι0 : X0 → M(Rd),

x 7→ Xy∈Zdx\{0}

δy.

(2.17)

Proposition 2.2. The maps ι and ι0 are topological embeddings.
Proof. To establish the continuity of ι, we need to show that, for every f ∈ Cc(Rd), xj → x
in X implies ι(xj)f → ι(x)f . By the Γ-equivariance of ι, it is suﬃcient to show that gj → g
in G implies

f (y).

fk,δ(y) =
ι(x)fk,δ = Xy∈Zdg

Let A be the compact support of f . Since gj → g, the closure of A′ = ∪j(Ag−1
j ) is compact.
Hence Zd ∩ A′ is ﬁnite. For a ∈ Zd \ A′ we have f (agj) = f (ag) = 0, and for the ﬁnitely
many a ∈ Zd ∩ A′ we have f (agj) → f (ag).

The map ι is injective, since the lattice Zdx uniquely determines x ∈ Γ\G. Let ˜ι : X →
ι(X), x 7→ ι(x). To establish the continuity of ˜ι−1, we need to show that ι(xj)f → ι(x)f for
every f ∈ Cc(Rd) implies xj → x in X. Fix g = (M, ξ) ∈ Γx. Then e1M, . . . , enM forms
a basis of ZdM, where ek are the standards basis vectors of Zd. Set e0 = 0 and deﬁne for
k = 0, 1, . . . , n,

δ ky − ekgk if δ

6 ky − ekgk < δ

(2.19)

if ky − ekgk < δ
2

if ky − ekgk > δ.

Note that fk,δ ∈ Cc(Rd). By the discreteness of Zdg, there is δ0 > 0 such that for all δ ∈ (0, δ0],
all k = 0, 1, . . . , n,

fk,δ(y) = fk,δ(ekg) = 1.

(2.20)

Since by assumption ι(xj)fk,δ → ι(x)fk,δ = 1, given δ > 0, there is j0 ∈ N such that for every
j > j0 and for every k, there is at least one element in Zdxj within distance δ to ekg. Call
this element y(j)

k . Then

y(j)

k → ekg = ekM + ξ for every k = 0, 1, . . . , d,

and therefore

y(j)
k − y(j)

0 → ekg − e0g = ekM for every k = 1, . . . , d.

(2.21)

(2.22)

Because of this and the fact that the lattices Zdxj − y(j)
one, the vectors y(j)
j). Then

0 , . . . , y(j)

1 − y(j)

n − y(j)

0 and Zdx − ξ both have covolume

ξj := y(j)

(2.23)

Now (2.21) implies gj = (Mj, ξj) → g = (M, ξ) and thus xj → x.

The proof for ι0 is almost identical.

Every random element ζ in X deﬁnes a point process Θ = ι(ζ) in M(Rd). Let ζt be the

random element distributed according to Pt, and ζ according toeµξ, with ξ /∈ Zd. Theorem 2.1

d−→ ζ. In view of Proposition 2.2 and the continuous mapping
can then be rephrased as ζt
theorem [13, Theorem 4.27], this is equivalent to the following convergence in distribution for
the point processes Θt = ι(ζt) and Θ = ι(ζ) in the case ξ /∈ Zd, Θ0,t = ι0(ζt) and Θ0 = ι0(ζ)
for ξ ∈ Zd. To simplify notation we suppress the dependence on ξ; Θ depends on the choice
of ξ ∈ Rd \ Zd.

Theorem 2.3. For t → ∞,

Θt

d−→ Θ (ξ /∈ Zd),

Θ0,t

d−→ Θ0

(ξ ∈ Zd).

(2.24)

We now turn to the ﬁnite-dimensional distribution of the above point processes, cf. [17,

Sec. 5].

Corollary 2.4. Let n ∈ N and A1, . . . , An ⊂ Rd bounded Borel sets with Leb(A. i) = 0 for all
i. Then, for t → ∞,

(ΘtA1, . . . , ΘtAn)

d−→ (ΘA1, . . . , ΘAn)

(ξ /∈ Zd),

(Θ0,tA1, . . . , Θ0,tAn)

d−→ (Θ0A1, . . . , Θ0An)

(ξ ∈ Zd).

(2.25)

(2.26)

In view of [13, Theorem 16.16], the main ingredient in the derivation of Corollary 2.4
from Theorem 2.3 is to show that Leb(A. i) = 0 implies that ΘA. i = 0 almost surely, and
Θ0A. i = 0 almost surely. This follows from Siegel’s integral formula [25, 26], which says
that E Θ0B = Leb(B), E ΘB = Leb(B) for every B ∈ B(Rd) (note that this identity is
straightforward for ξ /∈ Qd, since it follows directly from the translation invariance of Θ).
Note that ΘA. i = 0 fails for ξ ∈ Zd if 0 ∈ A. i. This is the reason for removing 0 in the
deﬁnition (2.17) of ι0. But Siegel’s formula implies Leb(A. i) = 0 if and only if Θ0A. i = 0
(resp. ΘA. i = 0) almost surely. Therefore the statement of Corollary 2.4 is in fact equivalent
to Theorem 2.3 via [13, Theorem 16.16]. We will exploit the analogue in the treatment of
marked lattices.

The following lemmas will be useful below.

Lemma 2.5. For A ∈ B(Rd),

P(ΘA > 1) 6 Leb A (ξ /∈ Zd),

P(Θ0A > 1) 6 Leb A.

(2.27)

Proof. This follows from Chebyshev’s inequality followed by Siegel’s formula.

Lemma 2.6. For A ∈ B(Rd) and L ∈ Z>0,

P(ΘA > L) ≪A,ξ((1 + L)−d−1

(1 + L)−d

(ξ /∈ Qd),
(ξ ∈ Qd \ Zd),

and

P(Θ0A > L) ≪A (1 + L)−d.

Proof. See [15, Theorems 4.3, 4.5].

3 Marked lattices and marked point processes

We will now extend the discussion in the previous section to the space of marked lattices,
which is deﬁned as a certain ﬁber bundle over the space of lattices. The key point is now to
identify this space with a marked point process.

Each map ω : Zd → Y , where Y is the set of marks, produces a marking of the aﬃne
lattice Zdg with g ∈ G: the point y ∈ Zdg has mark ω(yg−1). A Y -marked aﬃne lattice is
thus the point set

{(mg, ω(m)) | m ∈ Zd}

(3.1)

in Rd × Y , and can be parametrized by the pair (g, ω) ∈ G × Ω, where Ω = {ω : Zd → Y } is
the set of all possible markings. Note that, for γ ∈ Γ, the point y = mγg ∈ Zdg has mark

ω(yg−1) = ω(mγ) = ωγ(y(γg)−1),

(3.2)

where ωγ(m) := ω(mγ). Hence (g, ω) and (γg, ωγ) yield the same marked aﬃne lattice. This
motivates the deﬁnition of the left action of Γ on G × Ω by γ(g, ω) := (γg, ωγ). We deﬁne a
right action of G on G × Ω by (g, ω)g′ := (gg′, ω). In analogy with the homogeneous space
setting we deﬁne

and

For the case ξ ∈ Zd, we have

X := Γ\(G × Ω)

Xξ := Γ\Γ(Gξ × Ω)(1, ξ).

(3.3)

(3.4)

Xξ = Γ\Γ((1, ξ)G0 × Ω) = Γ\Γ(G0 × (1, −ξ)Ω) = Γ\Γ(G0 × Ω) = X0.

(3.5)

which in turn can be identiﬁed with the space Γ0\(G0 × Ω) via the map Γ((M, 0), ω) 7→
Γ0(M, ω). Note that the point Γ((1, ξ)M, ω) = Γ(M, ω(1,−ξ)) is mapped to Γ0(M, ω(1,−ξ))
under this identiﬁcation.

Lemma 3.1. The map

Γ(g, ω) 7→ {(mg, ω(m)) | m ∈ Zd}

(3.6)

yields a one-to-one correspondence between X and Y -marked aﬃne lattices of covolume one.

Proof. For (g, ω) and (g′, ω′) to yield the same marked lattice, it is necessary that Zdg = Zdg′.
Hence g′ = γg for some γ ∈ Γ. But this implies ω′ = ωγ and hence (g′, ω′) = γ(g, ω).

We now extend the above correspondences to the topological setting. Let Y be a topo-
logical space, and endow the space of all markings Ω = Y Zd with the product topology.
Deﬁne the topology of G × Ω by the product topology, and on X , Xξ by the quotient and
subspace topology, respectively. If Y is locally compact second countable Hausdorﬀ (lcscH),
then Rd × Y is lcscH. Consider the measurable space (Y, B(Y )) with Borel σ-algebra B(Y ),
and deﬁne M(Rd × Y ) as the space of σ-ﬁnite Borel measures on Rd × Y equipped with the
vague topology. Under these assumptions, M(Rd × Y ) is Polish [13, Theorem A 2.3].

(3.8)

These maps are well-deﬁned and injective by Lemma 3.1. Note that κ0 maps the point

(cid:18)δω(−ξ), Xm∈Zd\{0}

δ(mM,ω(m−ξ)(cid:19).

(3.9)

Proposition 3.2. The maps κ and κ0 are topological embeddings.

Proof. To prove continuity of κ, we need to show that (gj, ωj) → (g, ω) in G × Ω implies

Xy∈Zdgj

f (y, ωj(yg−1

j )) → Xy∈Zdg

f (y, ω(yg−1))

(3.10)

for every f ∈ Cc(Rd × Y ). As in the proof of Proposition 2.2, the compact support of f
reduces the problem to showing that f (agj, ωj(a)) → f (ag, ω(a)) for ﬁnitely many a ∈ Zd.
The latter follows from the continuity of f .

Let ˜κ : X → κ(X ), x 7→ κ(x). To establish the continuity of ˜κ−1, we need to show that
κ(xj)f → κ(x)f for every f ∈ Cc(Rd × Y ) implies xj → x in X . We already know from
Proposition 2.2 that gj → g. Fix m ∈ Zd, and deﬁne for g ∈ G, h ∈ Cc(Y ),

if ky − mgk < δ

if ky − mgk > δ.

6 ky − mgk < δ

(3.11)

Note that fh,δ ∈ Cc(Rd × Y ). By the discreteness of Zdg, there is δ0 > 0 such that for all
δ ∈ (0, δ0],

fh,δ(y, ω(yg−1)) = fh,δ(mg, ω(m)) = h(ω(m)).

(3.12)

fh,δ(y, t) =
κ(x)fh,δ = Xy∈Zdg
κ(xj)fh,δ = Xy∈Zdgj

Since gj → g, for given δ > 0, there is j0 ∈ N such that for all j > j0,

fh,δ(y, ωj(yg−1

j )) = fh,δ(mgj, ωj(m)) = h(ωj(m)).

(3.13)

Now κ(xj)f → κ(x)f for every f ∈ Cc(Rd × Y ) implies h(ωj(m)) → h(ω(m)) for every ﬁxed
h ∈ Cc(Y ) and m ∈ Zd. That is, δωj (m) → δω(m) in M(Y ). Any open set B containing ω(m)

8

satisﬁes δω(m)B = 1 and δω(m)∂B = 0. Thus δωj (m)B → 1 for any open set B containing
ω(m) [13, Theorem A 2.3], and therefore ωj(m) → ω(m). This implies ωj → ω in the
product topology of Ω.

The proof for κ0 is similar to the above, with the following modiﬁcations. Eq. (3.10) is

replaced by

(cid:18)f1(ωj(0gj

−1)), Xy∈Zdgj\{0}

f2(y, ωj(yg−1

j ))(cid:19) →(cid:18)f1(ω(0g−1)), Xy∈Zdg\{0}

f2(y, ω(yg−1))(cid:19),

(3.14)

for every (f1, f2) ∈ Cc(Y ) × Cc(Rd × Y ), which is seen to hold as in the argument for κ.

Let ˜κ0 : X → κ0(X ), x 7→ κ0(x). To establish continuity of ˜κ−1

0 , it is enough to show

that

[κ0(xj)(f1, f2) → κ0(x)(f1, f2), for all (f1, f2) ∈ Cc(Y ) × Cc(R2 × Y )] ⇒ [xj → x].

(3.15)

We know from Proposition 2.2 that gj → g, and need to show that ωj → ω. For any
m ∈ Zd \ {0}, deﬁne fh2,δ as in (3.11). It follows from discreteness of Zdg that there is δ0 > 0
such that for all δ ∈ (0, δ0],

κ0(x)(h1, fh2,δ) =(cid:18)h1(0), Xy∈Zdg\{0}

fh2,δ(y, ω(yg−1))(cid:19)

= (h1(ω(0)), fh2,δ(mg, ω(m)))
= (h1(ω(0)), h2(ω(m))) .

Since gj → g, we have

κ0(xj)(h1, fh2,δ) = (h1(ωj(0)), h2(ωj(m)))

for all j > j0. Thus, we have

(3.16)

(3.17)
(3.18)

(3.19)

(h1(ωj(0)), h2(ωj(m))) → (h1(ω(0)), h2(ω(m)))

(3.20)

for all bounded continuous functions h1, h2 and m ∈ Zd \ {0}, inasmuch as (δωj (0), δωj (m)) →
(δω(0), δω(m)) in M(Y ) × M(Rd × Y ) for each m ∈ Zd \ {0}. This implies that ωj → ω in
the product topology on Ω, as needed.

To deﬁne probability measures on the space Xξ of aﬃne marked lattices, let us ﬁx a
random ﬁeld η : Zd → Y , m 7→ η(m) deﬁned by the probability measure ν on the measurable
space (Ω, B) (where B = B(Ω) is the Borel σ-algebra on Ω = Y Zd with respect to the product
topology) via

P(η(m1) ∈ A1, . . . , η(mk) ∈ Ak) = ν{ω ∈ Ω | ω(m1) ∈ A1, . . . , ω(mk) ∈ Ak}

(3.21)

9

for all A1, . . . , Ak ∈ B(Y ). In other words, η is a random element in Ω distributed according
to ν.

We deﬁne the mixing coeﬃcient of order k of the random ﬁeld η by

ϑk(s) = sup(cid:8)ϑk(m1, . . . , mk)(cid:12)(cid:12)m1, . . . , mk ∈ Zd, kmi − mjk > s if i 6= j(cid:9),

where k · k is the Euclidean norm, and

ϑk(m1, . . . , mk) :=

sup

A1,...,Ak∈B(Y )(cid:12)(cid:12) P(η(m1) ∈ A1, . . . , η(mk) ∈ Ak)

− P(η(m1) ∈ A1) · · · P(η(mk) ∈ Ak)(cid:12)(cid:12).

We say η is mixing of order k if

lim
s→∞

ϑk(s) = 0,

and mixing of all orders if it is mixing of order k for all k ∈ N. Note that mixing of order
two need not imply mixing of order three; cf. Ledrappier’s “three dots” example [14, 6].

Given ξ ∈ Rd and a probability measure ρ on Y , we also deﬁne

(3.22)

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

βξ(s) = sup

km+ξk>s

sup

A∈B(Y )(cid:12)(cid:12) P(η(m) ∈ A) − ρ(A)(cid:12)(cid:12).

If lims→∞ β0(s) = 0, we say η has asymptotic distribution ρ. The presence of ξ in (3.25) is
purely for notational convenience further on.

The above mixing conditions will be suﬃcient for the results in Section 4. We will need

the following stronger variant for our main results in Section 5.

Given a non-empty subset J ⊂ Zd and a map a : J → Y , we deﬁne the cylinder set

Ωa = {ω ∈ Ω | ω(m) = a(m) ∀m ∈ J}.

(3.26)

The subalgebra generated by all cylinder sets Ωa for a given J is denoted by BJ . The
separation of two non-empty subsets J1, J2 ⊂ Zd is deﬁned as

We deﬁne the strong-mixing coeﬃcient of the random ﬁeld η by

sep(J1, J2) = min(cid:8)km1 − m2k : m1 ∈ J1, m2 ∈ J2(cid:9).
α(s) = sup(cid:8)α(J1, J2)(cid:12)(cid:12)J1, J2 ⊂ Zd non-empty, sep(J1, J2) > s(cid:9),
α(J1, J2) := sup(cid:8)(cid:12)(cid:12)ν(cid:0)A1 ∩ A2(cid:1) − ν(A1)ν(A2)(cid:12)(cid:12) : A1 ∈ BJ1, A2 ∈ BJ2(cid:9).

We say η is strongly mixing if

where

lim
s→∞

α(s) = 0.

(3.28)

(3.29)

(3.30)

Note that, in the case of singleton sets, we have

α({m1}, {m2}) = ϑ2(m1, m2).

(3.31)

Thus strong mixing implies mixing of order two. In fact, strong mixing implies mixing of
any order. This follows from the following observation. For k > 2, put

where

αk(s) := sup(cid:8)αk(J1, . . . , Jk)(cid:12)(cid:12)J1, . . . , Jk ⊂ Zd non-empty, sep(Ji, Jj) > s for i 6= j(cid:9),
ν(Ai)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) : Ai ∈ BJi(cid:27).

αk(J1, . . . , Jk) := sup(cid:26)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ν(cid:0)A1 ∩ · · · ∩ Ak(cid:1) −

Lemma 3.3. If α(s) → 0 then αk(s) → 0 and ϑk(s) → 0 for all k > 2.

kYi=1

(3.32)

(3.33)

Proof. Note that αk(s) → 0 implies ϑk(s) → 0, since

αk({m1}, . . . , {mk}) = ϑk(m1, . . . , mk).

(3.34)

We will show that αk(s) → 0 implies αk+1(s) → 0. The claim then follows by induction on
k. We have BJi ⊂ BJ for J := J1 ∪ · · · ∪ Jk and therefore

A := A1 ∩ · · · ∩ Ak ∈ BJ .

(3.35)

This in turn implies

ν(Ai)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) : Ai ∈ BJi(cid:27)
ν(Ai)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) : Ai ∈ BJi(cid:27).

αk+1(J1, . . . , Jk+1) = sup(cid:26)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ν(cid:0)A ∩ Ak+1(cid:1) −

6 sup(cid:26)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ν(cid:0)A ∩ Ak+1(cid:1) − ν(A)ν(Ak+1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) : A ∈ BJ , Ak+1 ∈ BJk+1(cid:27) (3.37)

because ν(Ak+1) 6 1. Therefore αk+1(s) 6 αk(s) + α(s), which yields the desired conclusion.

The ﬁrst term equals α(J, Jk+1), and the second satisﬁes

An important example of a (strongly) mixing random ﬁeld is the case when η is a ﬁeld
of i.i.d. random elements with law ρ, and thus α(s) = 0 for all s.
In this case we write
ν = νρ. Note that νρ is invariant under the Γ-action on Ω. Given such νρ, consider the
product measure µξ × νρ on Gξ × Ω. We denote the push-forward of this measure (restricted
to a fundamental domain for the Γ-action) under the projection map

Gξ × Ω → Xξ,

(g, ω) 7→ Γ(g, ω)(1, ξ)

(3.40)

by eµξ,ρ. Recall µξ is normalized so that it projects to a probability measure on Xξ, which
implieseµξ,ρ is a probability measure. Note thateµξ,ρ is well deﬁned thanks to the Γ-invariance

A random element ζ in Xξ deﬁnes a point process Ξ = κ(ζ) in M(Rd × Y ). The Siegel

of νρ.

formula for the space of lattices yields:

Lemma 3.4. Let ξ /∈ Zd. For D ∈ B(Rd × Y ),

E ΞD = (Leb ×ρ)D.

(3.41)

Proof. It suﬃces to consider D = A×B with A ∈ B(Rd) and B ∈ B(Y ). Since the η(m) are
independent with law ρ, we have ΞD = Θ(A)ρ(B). The expectation is E ΞD = E(ΘA)ρ(B) =
Leb(A)ρ(B) by Siegel’s formula.

A further special case is when {η(m), m ∈ Zd} is a collection of independent random
variables with η(0) distributed according to ρ0 and η(m) distributed according to ρ when
m 6= 0. In this case we write ν = νρ0,ρ. Note that νρ0,ρ is now invariant under the Γ0-action
on Ω. Given such νρ0,ρ, consider the product measure µ0 × νρ0,ρ on G0 × Ω. We denote the
push-forward of this measure (restricted to a fundamental domain for the Γ0-action) under
the projection map

G0 × Ω → X0,

(g, ω) 7→ Γ(g, ω)

(3.42)

by eµ0,ρ0,ρ. Since µ0 is normalized so that it projects to a probability measure on X0, also
eµ0,ρ0,ρ is a probability measure. Here eµ0,ρ0,ρ is well deﬁned because of the Γ0-invariance

of νρ0,ρ. A random element ζ in X0 deﬁnes a random product measure (ϕ, Ξ0) = κ(ζ) in
M(Y ) × M(Rd × Y ), where ϕ is a point mass and Ξ0 a point process.

Lemma 3.5. For D ∈ B(Y × Rd × Y ),

E(ϕ, Ξ0)D = (ρ0 × Leb ×ρ)D.

(3.43)

Proof. It is suﬃcient to consider D = B0 × A × B with A ∈ B(Rd) and B0, B ∈ B(Y ).
Since the η(m), η(0) are independent with law ρ and ρ0 respectively, we have ΞD =
ρ0(B0)Θ0(A)ρ(B). The expectation is E ΞD = ρ0(B0) E(Θ0A)ρ(B), and the claim follows
from Siegel’s formula E Θ0A = Leb A.

Theorem 4.2 (and hence Theorem 4.1) follows from the convergence of ﬁnite-dimensional

Proposition 4.3. Let ξ /∈ Zd, and assume η is mixing of all orders with asymptotic distri-
bution ρ. Let n ∈ N, D1, . . . , Dn ∈ B(Rd × Y ) bounded with ΞD. i = 0 almost surely for all i.
Then, for t → ∞,

Proposition 4.4. Let ξ ∈ Zd, and assume η is mixing of all orders with asymptotic distri-
bution ρ. Let n ∈ N, D1, . . . , Dn ∈ B(Rd × Y ) bounded with Ξ0D. i = 0 almost surely for all
i, and B0 ∈ B(Y ) with ϕB. 0 = 0 almost surely. Then, for t → ∞,

(ϕtB0, Ξ0,tD1, . . . , Ξ0,tDn)

d−→ (ϕB0, Ξ0D1, . . . , Ξ0Dn).

(4.6)

Proof of Proposition 4.3. It is suﬃcient to consider test sets of the form Di = Ai × Bi with
Ai ∈ B(Rd) bounded and Bi ∈ B(Y ) such that Ξ(.Ai × Bi) = 0 almost surely. In view of
Lemma 3.4 the latter is equivalent to (Leb ×ρ)(.Ai × Bi) = 0. We also assume without loss
of generality that Ai are pairwise disjoint.

Corollary 2.4, Lemma 2.5 and the Chebyshev inequality imply that for every bounded

D0 = A0 × B0 we have

lim sup

t→∞

P(ΞtD0 > 1) 6 lim sup

t→∞

P(ΘtA0 > 1) 6 P(ΘA0 6 1) 6 Leb A0.

(4.7)

Hence sets D0 = A0 × B0 where the closure of A0 has small Lebesgue measure have small
probability, and we can thus remove such sets from the Di. This explains why, without loss
of generality, we may assume from now on that the Ai are convex and that the hyperplane
{x1 = 0} does not intersect the closure A of A := ∪n

i=1Ai. Set

Lt,u = Zd(1, ξ)ME(u)Φt,

(4.8)

and write q = m(1, ξ)ME(u)Φt ∈ Lt,u with m ∈ Zd uniquely determined by q. Writing
e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0) for the ﬁrst standard basis vector in Rd, we have

q · e1 = m(1, ξ)ME(u)Φt · e1 = e−(d−1)t(m + ξ)ME(u) · e1

(4.9)

and hence for some constants cM > 0, cA,M > 0 (depending only on M resp. A and M)

(cid:13)(cid:13)m + ξk > cM(cid:13)(cid:13)(m + ξ)Mk > cM e(d−1)t(cid:12)(cid:12)q · e1(cid:12)(cid:12) > cA,M e(d−1)t,

uniformly for all q ∈ A, t > 0.

For a small parameter ε > 0 to be chosen later write U = U (ε)

1 ∪ U (ε)

2 , where

(4.10)

U (ε)

1 = {u ∈ U : ∃q1 6= q2 ∈ A ∩ Lt,u s.t. |(q1 − q2) · e1| < ε}

(4.11)

2 = U \ U (ε)

1 . The set U (ε)

and U (ε)
comprises directions corresponding to lattice points m ∈ Zd
that are εe(d−1)t-separated. That is, for q1 = m1(1, ξ)ME(u)Φt and q2 = m2(1, ξ)ME(u)Φt
with u ∈ U (ε)

2

2 , we have

(q1 − q2) · e1 = (m1 − m2)ME(u)Φt · e1 = e−(d−1)t(m1 − m2)ME(u) · e1

(4.12)

and hence

(cid:13)(cid:13)m1 − m2k > cM(cid:13)(cid:13)(m1 − m2)Mk > cM e(d−1)t(cid:12)(cid:12)(q1 − q2) · e1(cid:12)(cid:12) > cM εe(d−1)t.

(4.13)

We will use the higher-order mixing property to show that markings at such points become
independent. The set U (ε)
includes directions in which there are some lattice points that are
1
close. We will show that the measure of such directions tends to zero as ε → 0.

Since A is bounded, the number of non-zero terms in this sum is O(1/ε), where the implied
constant depends only on A (not on t). Taking the limit t → ∞ yields (Corollary 2.4)

Because we have assumed that the closure of A does not meet the hyperplane {x1 = 0}, for

E(ε) 6Xk∈Z

P(cid:0)Θ(cid:0)A ∩(cid:0)[kε, kε + 2ε] × Rd−1(cid:1)(cid:1) > 2(cid:1).
each k > 0 the set A ∩(cid:0)[kε, kε + 2ε] × Rd−1(cid:1) is contained in the cylinder

Z(c1, c2, C) =(cid:8)(x1, . . . , xd) ∈ Rd : c1 < x1 < c2, k(x2, . . . , xd)k < C(cid:9)

form some c1 > 0, c2 > c1 + 2ε, and C suﬃciently large in terms of A. (The case of negative
k is analogous.) Therefore, when d = 2 and ξ ∈ Q2, we have [17, Lemma 7.12]

(4.35)

(4.36)

P(cid:0)Θ(cid:0)A ∩(cid:0)[kε, kε + 2ε] × Rd−1(cid:1)(cid:1) > 2(cid:1) = O(ε2 log ε),

17

(4.37)

and so E(ε) = O(ε log ε) → 0 as ε → 0. In all other cases we have (use [17, Lemmas 7.12] for
ξ ∈ Qd, d > 3, and [17, Lemmas 7.13] for ξ /∈ Qd, d > 2)

P(cid:0)Θ(cid:0)A ∩(cid:0)[kε, kε + 2ε] × Rd−1(cid:1)(cid:1) > 2(cid:1) = O(ε2),

that is E(ε) = O(ε) → 0 as ε → 0.

(4.38)

Proof of Proposition 4.4. The proof is almost the same as that of Proposition 4.3. We have
that Ξ0,t is a random point process on Rd that is jointly measurable with a random variable
on Y whose marginal is ϕt. We follow the steps of the previous proof until (4.14). For
ri ∈ N ∪ {0}, i > 1, we have

5 Spherical averages in the space of marked lattices: almost

sure convergence

Let us now turn to the main result of this paper. We say the random ﬁeld η is slog-mixing

(slog stands for strongly super-logarithmic), if for every δ > 0

This holds for instance when

α(eδt) < ∞.

Main Theorem 5.1. Fix ξ ∈ Rd and M ∈ G0. Assume the random ﬁeld η is slog-mixing
with asymptotic distribution ρ. Then there is a set Ω0 ⊂ Ω with ν(Ω0) = 1, such that for

The proof of these two propositions will require the following lemma. For each ζ > 0,

deﬁne Cζ ⊂ B(Rd × Y ) as the collection of sets D = A × B with the following properties:

(i) A ∈ B(Rd) is convex and contained in the ball of radius 1/ζ around the origin,

19

(ii) B ∈ B(Y ) such that (Leb ×ρ)(.A × B) = 0,
(iii) ([−ζ, ζ] × Rd−1) ∩ A = ∅.

Lemma 5.5. Given ε > 0, ζ < ∞, there are constants s0, t0 such that for all t > t0, |s| 6 s0,
ω ∈ Ω, and every D ∈ Cζ (in fact we only require property (i) in the deﬁnition of Cζ),

e1E(u2)−1k > θ0. Recall that for every i, the closure of Ai does not intersect a ζ-neighborhood
of the hyperplane {x1 = 0}, and Ai is contained in a ball of radius 1/ζ. This implies
that the set AiΦ−tE(u)−1 asymptotically aligns in direction ±e1E(u)−1, avoiding a e(d−1)t-
neighborhood of the origin. More precisely, there is a constant Cζ > 0 such that

km1 − m2k > cM k(m1 − m2)Mk > cM Cζθ0e(d−1)t.

are at distance at least cM Cζθ0e(d−1)t apart. Thus, by strong mixing,

6 Random defects

Spherical averages were used in [17] and [19] to establish the limit distribution for the
free path length in crystals and quasicrystals, respectively. The plan for the remainder of
this paper is to explain how spherical averages on marked lattices can be exploited to yield
the path length distribution for crystals with random defects. The idea is to start with a
perfect crystal, whose scatterers are located at the vertices of an aﬃne Euclidean lattice
L = Zd(1, ξ)M, and then remove or shift each lattice point with a given probability. This
can be encoded by a marking of L as follows. The set of marks is Y = {0, 1} × Rd, where the
ﬁrst coordinate describes the absence or presence of a lattice point, and the second its relative
shift measured in units of r = e−t. The corresponding marking is denoted by ω = (a, z) with
a : Zd → {0, 1} and z : Zd → Rd. The defect aﬃne lattice is thus

{(m + ξ)M + rz(m) : m ∈ Zd s.t. a(m) = 1}.

(6.1)

In the case when ξ ∈ Zd, it is natural to shift the above point set by −rz(−ξ) so that the
shifted set contains the origin. To unify notation, let us therefore deﬁne the ﬁeld zξ by

zξ(m) =(z(m) − z(−ξ)

z(m)

(ξ ∈ Zd)
(ξ /∈ Zd).

(6.2)

24

In fact, for our application to the Lorentz gas, it will be convenient to shift the point set by a
more general vector rβ, where β is a ﬁxed bounded continuous function U → Rd; we denote
the shifted set (for all ξ ∈ Rd) by

As in the case of lattices (4.8), we are interested in the rotated-stretched point set Pt,u =

ePr,u = {(m + ξ)M + r[zξ(m) − β(u)] : m ∈ Zd s.t. a(m) = 1}.

(6.3)

ePr,uE(u)Φt, which reads explicitly (for r = e−t)

Pt,u = {(m + ξ)ME(u)Φt + ([zξ(m) − β(u)]E(u))⊥

+ e−dt(e1 · [zξ(m) − β(u)]E(u))e1 : m ∈ Zd s.t. a(m) = 1},

(6.4)

where ( · )⊥ is the orthogonal projection onto the hyperplane perpendicular to e1.

We map the marked aﬃne lattice (viewed as an element in X ) to a defect lattice (viewed

as an element in M(Rd)) by

σ : X → M(Rd),

σ0 : X0 → M(Rd),

We will ﬁrst discuss the relevant spherical averages in Xξ, and then show they map to

the above point processes.

Theorem 6.1. Assume η is slog-mixing with asymptotic distribution ρ, and ρ has compact
support. Fix M ∈ G0 and ξ ∈ Rd. Then there exists a set Ω0 ⊂ Ω with ν(Ω0) = 1, such that
for every ω = (a, z) ∈ Ω0, every a.c. λ and every bounded continuous f : Rd−1 × Xξ → R,

deµ0,ρ0,ρ(g, (a′, z′))

25

(ξ /∈ Zd)
(ξ ∈ Zd),

(6.11)

where ρ0 = δω(−ξ).

Proof. Since ρ has compact support and β is bounded,

sup
u∈U

sup
m∈Zd

|e1 · [zξ(m) − β(u)]E(u)| < ∞,

(6.12)

and hence Jt(a, [zξ − β(u)]E(u))(m) → J∞(a, [zξ − β(u)]E(u))(m) uniformly in u ∈ U,
m ∈ Zd. The claim now follows from Corollary 5.7.

The following is the key to translate the above convergence into the setting of point

processes.

Lemma 6.2. The maps σ and σ0 are continuous.

Proof. The proof is similar to that of Proposition 2.2; we sketch it in the case of σ.

We need to show that xj → x ∈ X implies that, for every f ∈ Cc(Rd),

Xy∈Zdgj

aj(yg−1

j )f (y + zj(yg−1

j )) → Xy∈Zdg

a(yg−1)f (y + z(yg−1)).

(6.13)

Since f is of compact support, the sums above are ﬁnite, and we can rewrite the left hand
side as

Xy∈Zdgj

aj(yg−1

j )f (y + zj(yg−1

j )) = Xm∈Zd

aj(m)f (mgj + zj(m)),

(6.14)

which is another ﬁnite sum. In particular, for all m in the support, we have that aj(m) =
a(m) and |zj(m)−z(m)| < ε once j > j0. The statement (6.13) now follows from continuity
of f .

For u randomly distributed according to λ, we deﬁne the random point processes

for ξ /∈ Zd and ξ ∈ Zd, respectively. If ξ /∈ Zd, we furthermore set

with (g, (a, z)) distributed according toeµξ,ρ and u distributed according to λ. That is,eΞ is a

random aﬃne lattice Zdg distributed according to µ, where each lattice point is removed, or
shifted in the hyperplane V⊥ = {0} × Rd−1, according to the push-forward of the probability
measure λ × ρ on U × {0, 1} × Rd under the map (u, a, z) 7→ (a, (zE(u))⊥). If ρ is rotation-
invariant, then this measure is independent of λ. In the case ξ ∈ Zd, we put

eΞ0 = σ0(cid:0)Γ(cid:0)g, J∞(a, [zξ − β(u)]E(u))(cid:1)(cid:1)

26

(6.17)

with (g, (a, z)) distributed according toeµ0,ρ0,ρ and u distributed according to λ. This means
that eΞ0 is a random lattice Zdg \ {0} distributed according to µ0, where each lattice point

is removed, or shifted in the hyperplane V⊥ = {0} × Rd−1, according to the push-forward of
the probability measure λ × ρ on U × {0, 1} × Rd under the map

(u, a, z) 7→ (a, ([z − z(−ξ) − β(u)]E(u))⊥).

(6.18)

This measure depends on λ even if ρ is rotation invariant.

Theorem 6.1 implies via Lemma 6.2 and the continuous mapping theorem the following

convergence in distribution.

7 Free path lengths in the Lorentz gas

For a given point set P ⊂ Rd, center an open ball Bd

r + y of radius r at each of the points
y in P. The Lorentz gas describes the dynamics of point particle in this array of balls, where
the particle moves with unit velocity until it hits a ball, where it is scattered according to a
given scattering map. The conﬁguration space for the dynamics is thus Kr = Rd \ (Bd
r + P).
Given the initial position q ∈ Kr and velocity v ∈ Sd−1
, the free path length is deﬁned as
the travel distance until the next collision,

1

τ (q, v; r) := inf{t > 0 : q + tv /∈ Kr}.

(7.1)

The distribution of the free path length is well understood for random [2], periodic [1, 5, 17]
and quasiperiodic [19, 20] scatterer conﬁgurations. We will here consider the periodic Lorentz
gas with random defects introduced in the previous section, where the scatterers are placed
at the defect lattice

Pr = {mM + rz(m) : m ∈ Zd s.t. a(m) = 1}.

(7.2)

Note that the papers [4, 23] discuss the convergence of a defect periodic Lorentz gas to
a random ﬂight process governed by the linear Boltzmann equation in the limit when the
removal probability of a scatterer tends to one. In this case the free path length distribution
is exponential, whereas for a ﬁxed removal probability < 1 the path length distribution has
a power-law tail; cf. (7.13).

As in [17], we will consider more general initial conditions, which for instance permit
us to launch a particle from the boundary of a scatterer (which is moving as r → 0). Let
β : Sd−1
1 → Rd be a continuous function, and consider the initial condition q + rβ(v). If
q ∈ ZdM and the initial condition is thus very near (within distance O(r)) to a scatterer, we
will avoid initial conditions inside the scatterer, or those that immediately hit the scatterer,
by assuming that β is such that the ray β(v) + R>0v lies completely outside Bd
1, for each
v ∈ Sd−1

.

The following theorem proves the existence of the free path length distribution for (a)
random initial data (q + rβ(v), v) for q /∈ ZdM ﬁxed, and v random with law λ, and (b)
random initial data (q + rβ(v) + rz(qM −1), v) for q ∈ ZdM ﬁxed, and v random with law
λ.

Theorem 7.1. Assume η is slog-mixing with asymptotic distribution ρ, and ρ has com-
pact support. Fix M ∈ G0 and q ∈ Rd. There exist continuous, non-increasing functions
Fs : R>0 → R with Fs(0) = 1 (s ∈ Z>0) and a set Ω0 ⊂ Ω with ν(Ω0) = 1, such that the
following hold for every T > 0, every (a, z) ∈ Ω0 and every absolutely continuous Borel
probability measure λ on Sd−1

(7.5)

Proof. The proof follows from Corollary 6.5 in the case of one-dimensional distributions
(n = 1) by the same arguments as in [17]. This proves the existence of the limits with

F0(T ) = P(cid:0)eΞZ(T, 1) = 0(cid:1) with ξ /∈ Qd,
Fs(T ) = P(cid:0)eΞZ(T, 1) = 0(cid:1) with ξ = s−1m,
F1(T ) = P(cid:0)eΞ0Z(T, 1) = 0(cid:1) with ξ ∈ Zd,

where

Z(T, R) :=(cid:8)(x1, . . . , xd) ∈ Rd : 0 < x1 < T, k(x2, . . . , xd)k < R(cid:9).

is independent of ξ ∈ Zd.

Note that the limit processeΞ is independent of the choice of ξ when ξ /∈ Qd, and only depends
on the denominator of ξ when ξ ∈ Qd \ Zd; cf. [17] for a detailed discussion. FurthermoreeΞ0

Let rmax be the inﬁmum over the radii of balls centered at the origin that contain the
support of ρ(1, · ) (which we have assumed to be compact). Then the maximal distance

between a point in the random aﬃne lattice Θ and its displacement in eΞ is rmax. Denote by

F s the corresponding path length distribution

F s(T ) = P(cid:0)ΘZ(T, 1) = 0(cid:1)

Lemma 7.2. For T > 0,

(s 6= 1),

F 1(T ) = P(cid:0)Θ0Z(T, 1) = 0(cid:1).

Fs(T ) > F s(cid:0)(1 + rmax)d−1T(cid:1).

Proof. We have

P(cid:0)eΞZ(T, 1) = 0(cid:1) > P(cid:0)ΘZ(T, 1 + rmax) = 0(cid:1) = P(cid:0)ΘZ((1 + rmax)d−1T, 1) = 0(cid:1),

where the last equality follows from the G0-invariance of Θ.

This lemma allows us to obtain lower bounds for the tails of Fs(T ) in terms of the free
path length asymptotics derived in [18]. In particular, Theorem 1.13 in that paper implies
the power-law lower bound

Note that this bound becomes ineﬀective in the limit of large rmax. The bound is also
consistent with the exponential distribution in the limit of removal probability → 1 discussed
in [4, 23], if the free path length is measured in units of the mean free path length, which
diverges as the removal probability tends to one.
