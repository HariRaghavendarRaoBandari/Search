ABSTRACT
Alhena (γ Gem) was observed in the frame of the BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer)
spectropolarimetric survey, which gathers high resolution, high signal-to-noise, high
sensitivity, spectropolarimetric observations of all stars brighter than V=4 to combine
seismic and spectropolarimetric studies of bright stars.

We present here the discovery of a very weak magnetic ﬁeld on the Am star Alhena,
thanks to very high signal-to-noise spectropolarimetric data obtained with Narval at
Télescope Bernard Lyot (TBL). All previously studied Am stars show the presence of
ultra-weak (sub-Gauss) ﬁelds with Zeeman signatures with an unexpected prominent
positive lobe. However, Alhena presents a slightly stronger (but still very weak, only a
few Gauss) ﬁeld with normal Zeeman signatures with a positive and negative lobe, as
found in stronger ﬁeld (hundreds or thousands of Gauss) stars. It is the ﬁrst detection
of a normal magnetic signature in an Am star.

Alhena is thus a very interesting object, which might provide the clue to under-

standing the peculiar shapes of the magnetic signatures of the other Am stars.

INTRODUCTION

1.1 Magnetism in hot stars

Over the last decades, magnetic ﬁelds have been discovered
in a signiﬁcant number of hot (A, B, and O) stars, and
these ﬁelds probably play a signiﬁcant role in their evolution.
However, the detailed properties of hot star magnetism are
not well understood yet. About 7% of hot stars are found to
be magnetic (Grunhut & Neiner 2015) with dipolar magnetic
ﬁelds above 300 G. The detection rate for the A-type stars is
similar (∼10%, Wolﬀ 1968; Power et al. 2007). In addition,
sub-Gauss longitudinal magnetic ﬁelds have recently been
discovered in a few A and Am stars.

The normal A star Vega was the ﬁrst ultra-weak ﬁeld
star discovered (Lignières et al. 2009). Its spectropolari-
metric time series was interpreted in terms of an ultra-
weak surface magnetic ﬁeld using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging
(ZDI).The results of this study support the fact that Vega
is a rapidly rotating star seen nearly pole-on. The recon-
structed magnetic topology revealed a magnetic region close
to the pole with radial ﬁeld orientation.

In addition, ultra-weak magnetic ﬁeld signatures have

been detected in three Am stars: Sirius A (Petit et al. 2011),
β UMa, and θ Leo (Blazère et al. 2016), thanks to very pre-
cise spectropolarimetric observations. For these objects, the
signature in circular polarization is not of null integral over
the line proﬁle but exhibits a positive lobe dominating over
the negative one. This peculiar signal, although not expected
in the standard Zeeman eﬀect theory, was demonstrated to
follow the same dependence on spectral line parameters as a
signal of magnetic origin and has been conﬁrmed to be mag-
netic (Blazère et al. 2016). Preliminary explanations are be-
ing proposed to explain the peculiar shape of the signatures.
In Am stars, high-resolution spectra have revealed stronger
microturbulence compared to normal A stars (Landstreet
et al. 2009). The very shallow convective shell producing
this turbulent velocity ﬁeld may host supersonic convection
ﬂows (Kupka et al. 2009). This could provide the source of
sharp velocity and magnetic gradients needed to produce
strongly asymmetric proﬁles. Shocks traveling in this su-
perﬁcial turbulent zone may also contribute to amplify any
existing magnetic ﬁeld.

Vega, Sirius A, β UMa, and θ Leo may well be the ﬁrst
conﬁrmed members of a new class of magnetic hot stars: the
ultra weakly magnetic hot stars. Such ultra weak magnetic
ﬁelds are diﬃcult to detect due to the weak amplitude of
their Zeeman signatures and may exist in other hot stars.

However, ultra weakly magnetic stars are considered a sepa-
rate class of magnetic stars compared to the ∼7% of stronger
ﬁeld stars, because no magnetic stars exist with a polar ﬁeld
strength between ∼300 G and the Gauss-level ﬁelds observed
in ultra weak magnetic stars.

To explain this dichotomy between strong and weak
magnetic ﬁelds in hot stars, Aurière et al. (2007) proposed
a new scenario based on the stability of a large scale mag-
netic conﬁguration in a diﬀerentially rotating star: strong
magnetic ﬁelds correspond to stable conﬁgurations and weak
magnetic ﬁelds to unstable conﬁgurations. Another theory
to explain the dichotomy is the failed fossil theory (Braith-
waite & Cantiello 2013): strong magnetic ﬁelds rapidly reach
an equilibrium whereas weak magnetic ﬁelds are still dynam-
ically evolving towards the equilibrium and decreased due to
the instability.

1.2 The Am star Alhena

Alhena was observed in the frame of the BRITE (BRIght
Target Explorer) spectropolarimetric survey. The BRITE
constellation of nano-satellites performs asteroseismology
of stars with V≤4 (Weiss et al. 2014). In this context,
we are performing a high resolution, high signal-to-noise
(S/N), high sensitivity, spectropolarimetric survey of all
stars brighter than V=4, with the ultimate aim to combine
seismic and spectropolarimetric studies of bright stars.

Alhena is a bright (V=1.90) spectroscopic binary, in
which the primary is a subgiant A0IVm star (Gray 2014) and
the secondary is a cool G star (Thalmann et al. 2014). The
orbital elements of the binary have been measured thanks
to interferometry (Drummond 2014). The orbital period is
12.63 years and the orbit is very eccentric with e=0.89. The
mass of the primary is estimated to 2.84 M(cid:12) and the one
of the secondary to 1.07 M(cid:12). The primary, Alhena A, is a
weakly Am star (Adelman et al. 2015b), similar to the three
known magnetic Am stars. The stellar parameters of Al-
hena A are actually very close to the ones of θ Leo, which
exhibits peculiar magnetic signatures in its Stokes V pro-
ﬁles (see Table 1).

2 OBSERVATIONS

Data were collected with the NARVAL spectropolarimeter
(Aurière 2003, Silvester et al. 2012), installed at the 2-meter
Bernard Lyot Telescope (TBL) at the summit of Pic du
Midi Observatory in the French Pyrénées. Narval is a high-
resolution spectropolarimeter, very eﬃcient to detect stellar
magnetic ﬁelds thanks the polarization they generate in pho-
tospheric spectral lines. It covers a wavelength domain from
about 375 to 1050 nm, with a resolving power of ∼ 68000.
We used the polarimetry mode to measure the circular
polarization (Stokes V). The 4 sub-exposures are construc-
tively combined to obtain the Stokes V spectrum in addition
to the intensity (Stokes I) spectrum. The sub-exposures are
also destructively combined to produce a null polarization
(N) spectrum to check for spurious detection due to e.g.,
instrumental eﬀects, variable observing conditions, or non-
magnetic physical eﬀects such as pulsations. Alhena was ob-
served on October 27, 2014, and September 18 and 19, 2015.
The journal of observations is provided in Table 2.

We used the Libre-Esprit reduction package (Donati
et al. 1997) to reduce the data. We then normalized each
of the 40 echelle orders of each of the 3 Stokes I spectra
with the continuum task of IRAF1. We applied the same
normalization to the Stokes V and N spectra.

3 MAGNETIC ANALYSIS

To test whether Alhena is magnetic, we use the Least Square
Deconvolution (LSD) technique. It is a cross-correlation
technique for computing average pseudo-line proﬁles from a
list of spectral lines in order to increase the S/N ratio. Under
several rough approximations (additive line proﬁles, wave-
length independent limb-darkening, self-similar local proﬁle
shape, weak magnetic ﬁelds), stellar spectra can indeed be
seen as a line pattern convolved with an average line proﬁle.
We ﬁrst created a line mask corresponding to the pri-
mary component of Alhena. We started from a list of lines
extracted from VALD (Piskunov et al. 1995; Kupka &
Ryabchikova 1999) for an A star with Teﬀ=9250 K and log
g=3.5, with their Landé factors and theoretical line depths.
We then cleaned this line list by removing the hydrogen
lines, the lines that are blended with hydrogen lines, as well
as those that are not visible in the spectra. We also added
some lines visible in the spectra that were not in the original

observations, with a false alarm probability always smaller
than 1.117×10−7 inside the stellar line. Therefore, we have a
deﬁnite detection of a magnetic ﬁeld in all 3 nights. We note
that the magnetic signatures are strong enough to be de-
tected in individual LSD Stokes V proﬁles, while for other
magnetic Am stars co-addition of many Stokes V proﬁles
were necessary to extract a magnetic signature (Blazère
et al. 2016). Outside the stellar line, we obtained a detection
probability between 20% and 40% and a false alarm proba-
bility between 7.356×10−1 and 5.351×101, that corresponds
to a non detection outside the stellar lines.

Since the diameter of the ﬁbre of Narval is 2.8 arcsec,
the two components of the binary have been recorded in
the observations. However, the secondary is 5-6 magnitudes
fainter than the primary, so only ∼2% of the received light
comes from the secondary component. Moreover, the sec-
ondary is not visible in the spectra. Thus, the contribution
of the lines of the secondary are considered negligible unless
its radial velocity is very close to the one of the primary. In
addition, we ran the LSD analysis with a mask correspond-
ing to a main sequence G star and the signatures in the
Stokes V proﬁles disappeared (see Fig. 2). We thus conﬁrm
that the signatures in the Stokes V proﬁles come from the
primary star, i.e. that the Am star is magnetic.

Using the centre-of-gravity method (Rees & Semel
1979) with a mean wavelength of 500 nm and a mean Landé
factor of ∼ 1.46 corresponding to the normalization param-
eters used in the LSD, we calculated the longitudinal ﬁeld
value (Bl) corresponding to these Zeeman signatures over
the velocity range [-40:8] km s−1.

The shape of the Zeeman signatures in the Stokes V
proﬁles slightly changed between the observation obtained
in 2014 and the ones from 2015. This could be due to a
rotational modulation of the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld, if
the ﬁeld is oblique compared to the rotation axis, as observed
in most hot stars (Grunhut & Neiner 2015). In 2014, the
signature would look like a cross-over signature, while in
2015 the negative pole may be observed.

On the contrary, the signatures obtained over two con-
secutive nights in 2015 did not change. This suggests that
either Alhena is an intrinsically slow rotator, or the rota-
tional modulation is small because the star is seen under
a speciﬁc geometrical conﬁguration with an inclination or
obliquity angle close to 0.

velocity and magnetic gradients producing strongly asym-
metric Zeeman proﬁles. Alhena A may have a too weak mi-
croturbulence to undergo this eﬀect.

Another diﬀerence between Alhena and θ Leo is that
Alhena is a binary star with a G-type companion, while
θ Leo is a single star. However, Sirius is also a binary star
and Sirius A does present peculiar magnetic signatures like
θ Leo. The distance between the two components of Sirius is
larger (Porb=50.1 years) than the one of Alhena, nevertheless
Alhena is a wide binary as well (Porb=12.63 years). However,
the orbit of Alhena B is more eccentric (e=0.89) than the
orbit of Sirius B (e=0.59), and there could thus be more
tidal interactions between the 2 components of Alhena than
between the components of Sirius.

Alhena is thus a very interesting star to understand the
magnetism of Am stars and ultra-weak magnetic ﬁelds in
general. We will continue to observe Alhena in the frame
of the BRITE spectropolarimetric survey to obtain more
information about its magnetic ﬁeld. In particular, the com-
parison between the observations obtained in 2014 and 2015
indicate that the Stokes V proﬁle could be rotationally mod-
ulated, although either the rotation period is long or the
geometrical conﬁguration leads to only weak modulation.
This could be tested, and the geometrical conﬁguration con-
strained, thanks to more spectropolarimetric observations
spread over the rotation period of Alhena A.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The observations presented in this paper correspond to the
ﬁrst detection of a magnetic ﬁeld in an Am star with a nor-
mal Zeeman signature, i.e. with a positive and negative lobe
as seen in the ultra-weakly magnetic A star Vega and in all
strongly magnetic hot stars. On the contrary, all the other
Am stars studied in spectropolarimetry with a high accuracy
exhibit peculiar magnetic signatures with only a prominent
positive lobe.

The diﬀerence between the ﬁeld of Alhena and the other
Am stars is thus puzzling. In particular, Alhena has very
similar stellar parameters as the ones of the magnetic Am
star θ Leo. However, the signatures in the Stokes V proﬁles
are very diﬀerent. θ Leo shows peculiar signatures, while Al-
hena shows normal signatures. Considering the oblique ro-
tator model, the dipolar magnetic ﬁeld Bd is at least 3.3
times the maximum observed Bl value (?Aurière et al. 2007).
Therefore, the longitudinal ﬁeld values measured for Alhena
point towards a polar magnetic ﬁeld strength of the order of
15 G, i.e. weak but much stronger than what is observed in
θ Leo and the other magnetic Am stars.

An explanation to the diﬀerence between the character-
istics of the magnetic ﬁeld observed in Alhena and in other
Am stars may be found in their microturbulence value. The
microturbulence of Alhena A is ∼ 1 km s−1(Adelman et al.
2015b), while the one of θ Leo, β UMa, and Sirius A is ∼ 2
km s−1(Adelman et al. 2015a, 2011; Landstreet et al. 2009).
Indeed, the peculiar shape of the magnetic signatures of the
latter 3 Am stars is thought to be related to their stronger
microturbulence, compared to normal A stars (Blazère et al.
2016). The very shallow convective shell producing this tur-
bulent velocity ﬁeld may host supersonic convection ﬂows
(Kupka et al. 2009), which could be the source of sharp
