Precision Muonium Spectroscopy

Netherlands

The muonium atom is the purely leptonic bound state of a positive muon and an electron. It
has a lifetime of 2.2 µs. The absence of any known internal structure provides for precision
experiments to test fundamental physics theories and to determine accurate values of funda-
mental constants. In particular groun dstate hyperﬁne structure transitions can be measured by
microwave spectroscopy to deliver the muon magnetic moment. The frequency of the 1s-2s
transition in the hydrogen-like atom can be determined with laser spectroscopy to obtain the
muon mass. With such measurements fundamental physical interactions, in particular Quan-
tum Electrodynamics, can also be tested at highest precision. The results are important input
parameters for experiments on the muon magnetic anomaly. The simplicity of the atom en-
ables further precise experiments, such as a search for muonium-antimuonium conversion for
testing charged lepton number conservation and searches for possible antigravity of muons
and dark matter.

1.

Introduction
Muonium (M = (µ+e−)) has been discovered by Hughes and collaborators in 1960,1–3
some 26 years after the ﬁrst muon had appeared in a Wilson cloud chamber.4 M consists of
two leptons from two diﬀerent particle generations. The particles are bound by the electro-
magnetic force. The positive muon (µ+) is an antiparticle from the second generation. The
electron (e−) is the lightest charged lepton and from the ﬁrst generation. Leptons are not di-
rectly subject to the strong force and they are point-like, i.e., to the best of our knowledge
they have no inner structure and all their known structure arises from well calculable virtual
ﬁelds in their vicinity.5
The lifetime τM of the exotic atom is essentially given by the free muon lifetime τµ.6 With the
presently achievable precision they diﬀer insigniﬁcantly by relative ≈ 6 · 10−10, which is due
to time dilation in the bound state.7 The lifetime,

τM = τµ = 2.196 980 3(2 2) µs ,

is suﬃciently long to enable a number of precision experiments in various ﬁelds of physics,
including atomic, particle and general physics as well as applications in, e.g., condensed mat-
ter and life sciences.8
Precision experiments on M, such as on the hyperﬁne splitting ∆νHFS , its Zeeman eﬀect, the
1s-2s frequency diﬀerence ∆ν1s2s and a search for spontaneous muonium to antimuonium
(MM) conversion, could not be performed in this millennium, yet. All the measurements,
which have been conducted to date, are essentially statistics limited.9 They had in their preci-
sion stage a necessity for long, extended beam time periods. For a number of such precision
experiments on M the intense µ+ beams at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex
(J-PARC), Tokai, Japan, have opened new and important possibilities for which the com-
munity has been waiting.10–12 Reﬁned precision experiments on M and muonic atoms are
needed in particular, because of the puzzling results reported from muonic hydrogen (µ−H)
spectroscopy,13–15 where the extracted value for the proton charge radius diﬀers from values
obtained by electron scattering. An explanation is still pending.
The success of ongoing research concerning the muon magnetic anomaly aµ in g-2 experi-
ments at Fermi National Accelerator center (FNAL), Batavia, U.S.A.,16 and at J-PARC17, 18
will depend on reliable values of fundamental constants,19 in particular on the muon magnetic
moment µµ and the muon mass mµ. These parameters are related through

where eµ is the muon electric charge, c the speed of light, B the magnetic ﬁeld in which
the experiment takes place, ωa the anomaly frequency measured in a muon g-2 experiment,
µp the proton magnetic moment and ωp the proton NMR frequency, if B is measured using
proton NMR, typically in water. In a system of measurements the inﬂuence of imperfections
in the magnetic ﬁeld measurement devices can be arranged to largely cancel, if both aµ and µµ
are determined with the magnetic ﬁeld measured by the very same devices and procedures.
Such an arrangement, which is limited in principle by statistical uncertainties and external
factors aﬀecting reproducibility only, has been in in place for the latest muon g-2 experiment
at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, U.S.A., and the measurements of the
Zeeman eﬀect of the ground state hyperﬁne structure (HFS) in M at the Los Alamos Meson
Physics Facility (LAMPF), Los Alamos, U.S.A. The experiments shared the very same
ﬁeld measurement system based on pulsed proton NMR in water, which provides for ﬁeld
measurements at absolute precision 3.4 · 10−8.20, 21

For a new round of precision experiments improvement of the B ﬁeld measurement can
be achieved with optically pumped, hyperpolarized 3He.22, 23 In this case the sensitivity to
the NMR sample container shape would be decreased by some three orders of magnitude,
reﬂecting the density ratio of the NMR samples.
Besides spectroscopy on M there is a particularly rich ﬁeld of fundamental precision
measurements on simple muonic atoms. They have potential to advance QED, electroweak
physics and nuclear physics.24, 25 Precision laser and microwave spectroscopy experiments
on M, (µ−4He), (µ−3He), and (µ−H) are underway and already produced puzzling results,
e.g., concerning the extracted proton (p) radius.13 Furthermore, in the past decade new and
novel experimental research has been suggested beyond optical and microwave spectroscopy
conducted to date.

2. Theory

M can be considered a light hydrogen (H) isotope. With the masses of µ+ and e− diﬀering
signiﬁcantly, the theoretical treatment of M is analogous to atomic H, except nuclear structure
is absent in M. E.g., in H this structure limits the comparison of experiment and theory for
the HFS in the n=1 state at relative precision ppm. While experiments achieved relative un-
certainty 10−13, theory is hindered by the knowledge of nuclear structure and polarizability.26
In view of some 7 orders of magnitude diﬀerence in accuracy, little progress has been made
in the past 3 decades. The M atom consists exclusively of leptons without inner structure, a
comparison of theory and experiment concerning ∆νHFS is possible at one order of magnitude
higher precision than for H. The limits on a comparison arise here from the knowledge of mµ+
and µµ, respectively, which in reverse both can be improved by more precise measurements.
The level energies of the isotopes hydrogen H, deuterium D, tritium T, as well as M (Fig. 1),
are given by26, 27

Additional corrections are due to QED eﬀects, the hyperﬁne interaction (EHFS (n, j, l, F)), the
weak interaction (Eweak), and possibly from exotic processes (Eexotic), which are not yet pro-
vided in the Standard Model. The QED corrections to the gross structure in M have been
subject to constant reﬁnement and they are very similar to natural atomic H and its isotopes.
The QED contributions consist of one- and two-loop corrections, relativistic and radiative
recoil corrections. For M there are no nuclear ﬁnite size eﬀects.
The interaction of the magnetic moment µN of the nucleus with spin I and the electron mag-
netic moment µe causes HFS. To good approximation the corresponding contribution to the

The QED corrections to ∆νHFS include radiative, recoil and combined radiative recoil correc-
tions. The calculations have been reﬁned recently.29 Weak interactions30 and possible exotic
eﬀects have been included. The weak interactions arise from Z boson exchange and yield a
contribution to Etot(n, j, l, F). Due to the short range of weak interactions associated with the
Z boson mass (≈91 GeV/c2) they can be modeled as a point current-current interaction with
an eﬀective vector-axial vector (V-A) type Hamiltonian. In the M atom with the coupling

resolution for the foreseeable future. For H the corresponding shift is 190 Hz; it is signiﬁ-
cantly larger, because of the diﬀerence in the axialvector - axialvector coupling contribution
to ∆νHFS . The hyperﬁne splitting of H and of M are aﬀected diﬀerently by the weak interac-
tions due to the diﬀerent muon - electron and nucleus - electron couplings. For M we have

As the µ+ is an antiparticle there are opposite signs for the eﬀect in M and in H, because the
latter consists of particles only. The size of δνM
HFS ,weak is about the size of the uncertainty in
the most recent measurement of ∆νHFS at LAMPF.31
Potential MM oscillations would inﬂuence the energy levels in M. The ground state of the
coupled MM system has eight energy eigenstates which are diﬀerent in energy from the four
eigenstates of the uncoupled M and M atoms. In the absence of external B ﬁelds the MM
mixing causes for s state HFS levels a splitting

near future possible experiments, in particular since MM conversion is suppressed in external
magnetic ﬁelds.34

3. Muonium Production

Polarized muons are available from intense muon channels at several accelerator centers.
For precision M experiments µ+ beams at surface muon momentum (≈29 MeV/c) and below
are particularly important. Such beams originate from pion decays at rest at (or near) the

surface of a muon production target in an intense proton beam. The µ+ are highly polarized
(up to 100%) due to parity violation in the decay π+ → µ+ + νµ from which µ+ are collected
and transported in a beam line.56 Production of M atoms can occur by e− capture, when µ+ are
stopped in matter.36 For precision fundamental experiments several diﬀerent methods exist:
(i) M is formed after µ+ are stopped and thermalized in gases with suited electron binding
energies such as N2, Ar and Kr. The µ+ are slowed down by collisions with gas atoms. In
the ﬁnal stages of the stopping process frequent e− capture and re-stripping occur. In the end
M can be formed by e− capture. In inert gases, i.e. in such with ionization energies above
13.55 eV no further chemical reactions take place.36 Production yields for cases of practical
importance are 65(5) %for Ar, 80(10) % for Kr and 100 % for Xe.57, 58 Due to collisional
quenching the atoms are in the n=1 state. The muon polarization in the sample of M atoms
depends on the magnitude of an external magnetic ﬁeld B.59 In high B ﬁelds (x ≫ 1), for
µ+ polarization P and for unpolarized electrons in the target the four hyperﬁne states are
populated with fractions fi, i = 1, ..., 4, (see Fig. 2)

where s = sin( 1
2arc cotx) for the ﬁeld parameter x from eq. 18. In
collisions with paramagnetic gases such as O2 the muon polarization is destroyed. Contam-
inations of the noble gas targets with paramagnetic atoms need to be kept below the some
10 ppm level.57 This M production method is the default for measuring the ground state hy-
perﬁne interval ∆νHFS in M.31
(ii) M in vacuum has been produced by shooting µ+ at keV energies through thin foils. In
this case electron transfer can result in M atoms in the ground state,60 M atoms in an excited
state,61, 62 including the metastable 2s state, and M− ions.62 The process is most probable, if
the velocity of the incoming µ+ matches the electron orbital velocity in the target atoms.
(iii) M in vacuum has been formed by stopping a µ+ beam in hot metal foils, e.g. tungsten,
from where M emerges at thermal energies. The µ+ thermalize in the foil, diﬀuse to the sur-
face, and leave the solid surface after capturing an e− from the solid.63 This method has found
applications in producing slow muon beams by photoionization of M.64–67
(iv) M in vacuum is formed, if µ+ are stopped near the surface of a SiO2 ﬂuﬀy powder tar-
get.68 The M atoms diﬀuse to the surface and leave it with thermal velocities. For the atoms
in vacuum a signiﬁcant polarization of 39(9) % has been found,69 which agrees with the

expected maximum fraction of 50 % according to eq. 19. The ﬂuﬃness of the powder is es-
sential and the production targets appear to loose eﬃciency on a timescale of approximately
one week. This is simmilar to the time scale that was found for H2O molecules leaving the
SiO2 targets after they are placed into a vacuum chamber.70 For typical µ+ beam momentum
bite ∆p/p = 5 % typical average yields of up to 2-5 % have been achieved in precision ex-
periments.71 For this the targets had to be replaced twice a week.33 SiO2 powder targets have
been employed for a number of precision experiments on M, including searches for MM con-
version33, 72 and laser spectroscopic measurements of ∆ν1s2s.73–76
(v) M atoms have been produced in SiO2 aerogel targets.71 A fraction of the atoms has been
observed to leave the SiO2 aerogel into the surrounding vacuum, if the stopping of the µ+
beam occurs close to the target surface. The yield of M in vacuum has been found to increase
for an increased area of the SiO2 target surface.71, 77 Recently research on this topic has been
intensiﬁed. A signiﬁcantly enhanced fraction of M that leaves the sample has been reported
for low density SiO2 aerogels. For these samples the surface had been enhanced by drilling
holes with depth comparable to the width of the µ+ stopping distribution and their separa-
tion and diameter of order M diﬀusion distance within τµ.78–81 A yield of 38(4)% was found
for mesoporous silica78, which is one order of magnitude above the yields achieved for SiO2
powder targets.
The recent progress in the production of M in vacuum from low density aerogels is very en-
couraging. These ﬁndings can be expected to boost new experiments for which M atoms in
vacuum are essential. Among those are improved laser spectroscopy of M,25 a search for MM
conversion with increased sensitivity82 and investigations of the gravitational interaction of
M.83, 84The proposed experiment at J-PARC for measureing the muon g-2 value also draws
on M atom production from aerogels and their subsequent photoionization.17, 18

4. Ground State Hyperﬁne Structure

The HFS in the n=1 state in M has been measured in a series of experiments with increas-
ing accuracy. The latest and most accurate results were achieved by the Yale-Heidelberg-
Syracuse collaboration at LAMPF. The experiment used the technique of old muonium.31 For
this the atoms were produced with a pulsed µ+ beam and signals were recorded from M atoms
that had lived and coherently interacted with an rf-ﬁeld driving the HFS transitions signiﬁ-
cantly longer than the free muon lifetime τµ+. This results in a resonance lineshape with a
central feature that is narrower than the natural linewidth δνHFS ,nat = 1/(2π· τµ+) = 144kHz.85
This feature provides for a better determination of the line center.

Fig. 3. For the latest M hyperﬁne structure experiment at LAMPF the quasi continuous beam from the accel-
erator was modulated to produce δT = 4 µs long pulses with T=10 µs separation. Signals were recorded after
a waiting time ∆T. The produced M atoms interacted constantly and coherently with the microwave ﬁeld in a
cavity.

sweeping the magnetic ﬁeld with microwave frequency kept constant, on the right are signals from sweeping

the second and third row correspond to old muonium resonances with the delay time indicated.

In order to obtain a time structure suited for an old muonium experiment the cw surface µ+
beam at LAMPF was chopped using an electrostatic deﬂector. The time structure is shown
in Fig. 3. The beam had an average particle rate of some 107µ+/s with close to 100 % po-

larization and ∆p/p = 10% momentum bite. It was stopped in a Kr gas target to produce
M. The O2 contamination in the target was minimized and kept below 5 ppm by circulat-
ing the gas constantly through a purifying system. The gas temperature was kept stable to
0.1 ◦C and its pressure was measured to 0.5 mbar. Data taking took place at p1=800 mbar
and p2=1500 mbar. The lowest possible pressure was determined by the stopping distribution
inside the microwave cavity and had been chosen to keep the fraction of muons stopping in
the walls of the cavity low.
The experiment was conducted in the homogeneous ﬁeld of a large bore superconducting
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) magnet at 1.7 T ﬁeld. The magnet was equipped with a
warm coil that provided for magnetic ﬁeld modulation. The microwave cavity had a quality
factor around 25 000 and it was operated in TM110 mode for transitions at frequency ∆ν12 and
TM210 mode for transitions at ∆ν34 (Fig. 2). Its resonance frequencies could be tuned with a
movable quartz tuning bar.
For the measurements magnetic ﬁeld scans as well as microwave frequency sweeps were con-
ducted in order to enable cross checks for various systematics. In both cases conventional and
narrowed spectra were recorded (Fig. 4). After correction for a small quadratic pressure shift
at the pressures p1 and p2 an extrapolation to zero pressure was performed. The magnetic
ﬁeld B had been calibrated and monitored with the very same magnetic ﬁeld measurement
concept and devices20, 21 which also have been employed in the measurement of the muon
magnetic anomaly aµ at BNL.86

The LAMPF experiment has been analyzed for a potential sidereal variations of the mea-
sured frequencies. No signal was found and thereby stringent limits for second generation
particles could be set.89 Based on a Standard Model extension model, further stringent tests
of Lorentz and CPT invariance in muon physics have been suggested.90 This theoretical
framework has no predictive power and it involves a multitude of potential parameters,
which all could indicate potential Lorentz and CPT violation. However, it provides a robust
theoretical framework for a quantitative evaluation and comparison of all experiments in the
area.

From earlier measurements in gases91, 92 the pressure dependence of ∆νHFS at pressures p

up to about 100 bar has been reported as

∆νHFS (p) = (1 + ap + bp2) · ∆νHFS ,

(25)

where ∆νHFS is the vacuum value. For Kr the coeﬃcients are aKr = 7, 996(8) · 10−6/ bar and
bKr = 5.5(1.1) · 10−9/ bar2. The term quadratic in p has been veriﬁed by ﬁtting data obtained
in measurements at pressures up to about 100 bar. For p=1 bar the quadratic shift amounts
to 25(5) Hz. This calls for attention in the next round of precision experiments which aim to
improve the LAMPF result by one order of magnitude.93, 94 In particular, experiments which
determine ∆νHFS have been conducted all at gas pressures where many-body collisions
dominate. Note, in the regime, where two-body collision dominate, deviations from mostly
linear behaviour have been observed for, e.g. atomic H, and hyperﬁne decoupling could be
established at p < 1 mbar.95
At J-PARC a new experiment to measure ∆νHFS and µµ is in progress.93, 94 It uses a concept
similar the latest LAMPF experiment, however, with signiﬁcantly improved technology. In
particular, a new and intense beam line96 will be employed. The microwave cavity will have
an extended length to reduce µ+ stopping in the cavity walls and to enable measurements at
lower gas pressures. New B ﬁeld calibration by proton NMR will be used and 3He based
ﬁeld calibration is considered. The project is well underway and aims for gaining one order
of magnitude over the latest measurement. A new directly measured value for µµ is urgently
needed. The new experiments to measure aµ require such a value which is independent of
elaborate QED theory and which has not been extracted from ∆νHFS . Note, here QED theory
is exploited to extract µµ, the theory which is stringently tested by aµ.

Fig. 5. Signal of M ground state hyperﬁne structure in vacuum.97 Thermal M atoms from a SiO2 powder
target emerged into a microwave cavity where they interacted with a microwave ﬁeld.

The observation of polarized M in vacuum69 has also enabled spectroscopy of n=1 state
HFS transitions in vacuum. An advantage arises from the absence of buﬀer gas related
corrections in such an experiment. A ﬁrst experiment has been conducted using a cw µ+
beam at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland,97 to measure ∆νHFS . An
obstacle to overcome is the ﬁnite average velocity of the atoms. Whereas in a gas the atoms
eﬀectively do not move, atoms emerging from a solid state surface have thermal velocity
distribution. In the experiment the average velocity was vM,therm = 7.4(1) mm/µs,69 which
corresponds to T = 296(10) K temperature. The atoms have in vacuum an average range of
16.3(2) mm. They had 39(9) % polarization and were entering a microwave cavity located in
less than 0.6 µT background magnetic ﬁeld. Inside the cavity transitions could be induced
between the 12S1/2,F=1,mF=1 and 12S1/2,F=1,mF=0 levels. They were signaled by a change
of the µ+ decay asymmetry (see Fig. 5). The resonance frequency was determined as ∆νHFS
= 1 463 310(25) kHz. The signal width was δνHFS = 215(50) kHz, which is consistent with
the natural linewidth δνnat = 144 kHz, microwave power broadening δνHFS ,power= 85(11) kHz
and Doppler broadening δνD = 45(10) kHz.
At an intense pulsed µ+ source and with modern decay positron tracing, the Doppler eﬀect
could be signiﬁcantly reduced, in particular, if the experiment were conducted with the old
muonium technique. Since studies for pressure shifts are obsolete, an experiment on ∆νHFS
in vacuum requires less µ+ from a beam than experiments which use µ+ stopping in a gas.

photo-ionization of the excited state and particle detection of the released µ+.

5. 1s-2s Transition

The gross structure splitting ∆ν1s2s in M has was measured in a pioneering experiment73, 98
at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK), Tsukuba, Japan, and in a
series of measurements with increasing accuracy75, 76, 99 at the Rutherford Appleton Labo-
ratory (RAL), Chilton, U.K., using Doppler-free two-photon laser spectroscopy. M atoms
were produced from SiO2 powder targets (see sec.3.). Laser induced two-photon transitions
12S1/2,F=1-22S1/2,F=1 could be detected via photo-ionization of the excited state by a third
photon from the same laser ﬁeld and the subsequent particle detection of the released µ+. The
early experiments used excimer laser pumped dye lasers with pulse lengths of order 15 ns.73, 99
Their light was frequency doubled in an electro-optical crystal to obtain light at wavelength
244 nm (see Fig. 1). Doppler-free two-photon signals were achieved by retro-reﬂecting the
laser beam onto itself. At the high pulsed laser intensities frequency chirping occurs at sev-
eral 10 MHz due to rapid optical phase changes in the pulsed optical ampliﬁers.100 This eﬀect
limits the accuracy to which the transition frequencies can be measured with fast pulsed laser
systems.
The most recent experiment employed a cw dye laser seeded pulsed alexandrite laser am-
pliﬁer at wavelength 732 nm the light of which was frequency tripled. The frequency chirp
of the alexandrite laser ampliﬁer during 100 ns long pulses could be compensated to below
10 MHz.101 The chirp was measured pulse by pulse76, 100 and it was correlated with individual
observed photoionization events. The signal analysis was based on a line shape model102, 103

Frequency chirping in the pulsed laser ampliﬁers100 were the main systematics in the
experiments on ∆ν1s2s to date. Therefore, signiﬁcant progress can be expected only from
future experiments with cw laser systems, where frequency chirps are absent. The intensity of
cw laser light can be enhanced signiﬁcantly in an optical cavity. Eﬀective photoionization for
the detection of the excited state requires an intense second light ﬁeld. For this step resonance
enhancement can be exploited. Along these lines an experiment has been proposed107 which
has a potential to achieve almost ∆νnat linewidth. The atoms are produced with a pulsed
µ+ beam from porous silica targets. They interact in a suited enhancement cavity for about
τM with a standing wave light ﬁeld at 244 nm wavelength. The n=2 state population is
detected via excitation to the 15P state with light at 368 nm wavelength and subsequent
photoionization of the atom and detection of the µ+. An event rate of 104 per day is predicted.
Such an experiment is expected to provide for a measurement of ∆ν1s2s to about 1 kHz
(≈10ppt). With such precision the knowledge of mµ can be improved over the presently best
value19 by one order of magnitude.

6. Future Possibilities

The increased M production yields reported for SiO2 aerogel targets together with the
upcoming intense µ+ sources suggest also to consider a new search for MM conversion. For
neutral kaons K0K0 oscillations are a well established reality in the hadron sector. In the lep-

ton sector the process involving the leptons e− and µ+, which correspond to the quarks in K0
and K0, has not been observed, yet. The last experiment33 was statistics limited by the avail-
able µ+ ﬂux. For a new experiment 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher sensitivity is within
reach through exploiting the time evolution of the MM conversion process (Fig. 7). For this,
at a pulsed µ+ source the ratio of the potential M signal to µ+ and M decay related background
could be signiﬁcantly reduced, in particular if a N-fold coincidence signal signature is em-
ployed. In this case the muon related background is expected to drop exponentially with a
time constant τµ/N = λ−1
A clear status assignment matter or antimatter is not obvious for the M atom. Firstly, the µ+
is an antiparticle. With mµ ≈ 207me potential antigravity can be expected to dominate for M.
Secondly, as far as lepton numbers are concerned, we have one particle and one antiparticle
which puts the status of M right in between such as it is the case also for positronium. At
present we do not have any proven theory that can reliably rule out antigravity for M. The
question needs to be investigated experimentally. For this, recently a new idea has been pro-
posed at PSI to search for potential antigravity using a Mach Zehender interferometer.83, 84
With intense muon beams suﬃcient statistics can be expected to ﬁnd a potential diﬀerence
in the free fall component of free moving M atoms. Such an experiment is particularly inter-

esting, because its interpretation is expected to be rather straightforward, unlike comparable
experiments with protons and antiprotons, which are in progress at the CERN AD facility.
For protons and anti-protons the inner structure of the particles contains next to three quarks
and three antiquarks primarily gluons, the energy of which is responsible for most of the mea-
sured mass. They are the same in protons and antiprotons which lets us expect at most a small
diﬀerence in the behaviour and all properties of both particles at all.108 One would therefore
rather expect a small diﬀerence in the hadron and antihadron gravitational interaction.
Next to the decay of M via Standard Model allowed µ+ decays and MM conversion, M
could decay also via a rare muon decay. Among the possible decays of the atom its possible
disintegration into 4 neutrinos has been theoretically studied.109 Yet, present and near future
source strengths at existing muon facilities as well as achievable detector eﬃciencies prohibit
experiments. More realistic is the exploitation of precision spectroscopy experiments for dark
matter searches. Here already constraints could be imposed recently from the results of HFS
measurements.35

Fig. 7. The probability to observe an M decay increases with time to a maximum after some 2τµ. The ratio
of M over µ+ decays increases further towards later times. This provides for a possible enhanced signal to
background ratio in an experiment where the time between M formation and M or M decay is recorded.82

7. Conclusions

Muonium has not yet decayed is the title of an article by Hughes and zu Putlitz in
1984.110 The statement is still true today, because at now available intense muon sources
such as at J-PARC precision experiments can enter a next level of accuracy, where the
Standard Model theory can be stringently tested, important fundamental constants19 can be
accurately measured, and powerful searches for new and exotic interactions can be con-
ducted. Every forefront precision experiment puts the hypothesis of lepton universality to test.

Klaus P. Jungmann was born in Heidelberg, Germany, in 1955. He received a diploma in
Physics in 1981 and a doctoral degree in 1985 from the University of Heidelberg, Germny.
Between 1985-1987 was postdoc at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Cal-
ifornia, U.S.A. From 1987-2001 he was at the Physikalisches Institut at the University of
Heidelberg as postdoctoral researcher, research assistant, University Docent and Extraordi-
nary Professor of Physics. From there he conducted precision experiments in muon physics at
the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory, United King-
dom, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, U.S.A., and the Brookhaven National Laboratory,
U.S.A. This included a search for muonium-antimuonium conversion, laser spectroscopy of
muonium , and measurements of the muonium hyperﬁne structure and the muon magnetic
anomaly. Since 2001 he is professor at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, where
he leads precision experiments on trapped radioactive and stable isotopes.
