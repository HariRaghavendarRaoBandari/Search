The QCD axion couplings of various invisible axion models are presented.

In particular, the
exact global symmetry U(1)PQ in the superpotential is possible for the anomalous U(1) from string
compactiﬁcation, broken only by the gauge anomalies at one loop level, and is shown to have
the resultant invisible axion coupling to photon, caγγ ≥ 8
aγγ ≃ 2. However, this
3
bound is not applicable in approximate U(1)PQ models with suﬃciently suppressed U(1)PQ-breaking
superpotential terms. We also present a simple method to obtain c0
aγγ which is the value obtained
above the electroweak scale.

INTRODUCTION

The detection possibility of the invisible axions [1–3] chieﬂy relies on its appreciable couplings to photon caγγ which

appears in the Lagrangian as

The axionic domain-wall number [4] is |c3 + c2| where c2 is the contribution from the standard model quarks [5]. With
this normalization from the QCD sector, the coupling caγγ is deﬁned and is composed of two parts,

caγγ = c0

aγγ + cch br

aγγ ≃ c0

(3)

aγγ is the one obtained above the electroweak scale and cch br

where c0
aγγ is the contribution obtained below the QCD
chiral phase transition scale. Since the mass ratio of up and down quarks is very close to 0.5 [6], we use the value
mu/md = 0.5 below. In this case, cch br
aγγ is –2 (a bit smaller value –1.98, including the strange quark contribution) [7].
The early summary on the axion–photon–photon couplings were summarized in [5, 8].1

An invisible axion is a pseudo-Goldstone boson whose mother symmetry is the Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry
[10]. The symmetry breaking scale relevant for the axion detection experiments [11, 12] are the intermediate scale
1010 GeV . fa . 1012 GeV, which can be achieved by the vacuum expectation value(VEV) of an SU(2)×U(1)Y sin-
glet σ [1]. But, the global symmetry which is broken at the intermediate scale has to be ﬁne-tuned to avoid the gravity
spoil of global symmetries. This diﬁculty has been appreciated [13] after realizing that even the classical gravity does
not necessarily preserve global symmetries due to the topology change via wormholes [14, 15]. The wormhole taking
out gauge charged is depicted in Fig. 1. An observer in the almost ﬂat space O notices that some gauge charges
are ﬂown to the shadow world S. To see the eﬀect in his own space only, he cuts the wormhole, then notices that
the escaped gauge charges are recovered to O. This conservation of gauge charges in the space O is due to the long
range electrix ﬂux lines. For the global charges, there is no such ﬂux lines and hence the escaped global charges
are not considered to be recovered to O if he cuts the wormhole. Thus, global charges are broken if we consider
the topology change. Related to this eﬀect, at ﬁeld theory level within supersymmetric(SUSY) framework, a host
of discrete symmetries are considered [16–20]. Some discrete symmetries can lead to acceptable approximate global
symmetries [21, 22].

1 The earlier uniﬁcation value was given in [9].

In this paper, we attempt to obtain a region of the parameter space from string compactiﬁed 4-dimensional(4D)
eﬀective ﬁeld theory. The 4D models from string compactiﬁcation do not allow global symmetries but allow some
discrete symmetries [23]. The minimal supersymmetric standard model supplied with singlets σ (to house the invisible
axion as pointed out in [1]) will be called σMSSM. In the σMSSM, we calculate the couplings between axion and
photon.

II. GAUGE TRANSFORMATION OF MODEL-INDEPENDENT AXION

Four dimensional pseudoscalars in the σMSSM from string compactiﬁcation appear from BMN (=10D antisymmetric
tensor ﬁeld with M, N ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 10}) and from the matter super-multiplets in the σMSSM. In 10D, BMN is a gauge
ﬁeld satisfying the gauge transformation,

BMN → BMN − ∂M ΛN + ∂N ΛM ,

(4)

where ΛM are gauge functions. If both M and N take the internal space coordinates i, j = {5, 6, · · · , 10}, Bij is a
pseudoscalar in 4D. From the 4D point of view, the original gauge transformation is not local, not carrying the 4D
index µ = {1, 2, 3, 4}. These pseudoscalars are the model-dependent (MD) axion [24], which is known to generate
superpotential terms [25]. So, the MD axions are not the useful candidates for solutions of the strong CP problem.
On the other hand the model-independent(MI) axion [26, 27], where both M and N of BMN take 4D indices µ, ν, is
a good candidate of 4D gauge transformation. Namely, the gauge transformation (4) is still a gauge transformation
in 4D. So, Bµν is not spoiled by gravity after the compactiﬁcation.

A. Anomaly-free U(1) gauge symmetry

If the MI axion is not behaving as a longitudinal degree of a gauge boson, then the axion potential is generated
and the bosonic collective motion behaves as cold dark matter (CDM) [12]. But, then the axion decay constant is
near the string scale, fa > 1016 GeV [28], and a ﬁne-tuning is needed, or the anthropic scenario must be invoked [29].
The coupling caγγ is the same as the one considered in the following subsection with anomalous U(1) without extra
charged singlets.

B. Anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry

If the compactiﬁcation produces an anomalous U(1)anom gauge symmetry, the corresponding U(1)anom gauge boson
obtains a large mass, at a slightly lower scale than the string scale. The presence of a Fayet-Illiopoulos D-term connects

3

the MI axion with the anomalous U(1)anom gauge boson [30], which is a kind of the Higgs mechanism providing the
longitudinal degree of the gauge boson. The generator of the anomalous U(1)anom belongs to the E8 × E8 algebra,
and matter ﬁelds have the U(1)anom charges. The ﬁeld Bµν or the MI axion does not couple to matter ﬁelds. So
below the U(1)anom gauge boson mass scale, the U(1)anom charge of matter ﬁelds becomes a global charge which
can be called a U(1)PQ charge. In this way, a global symmetry free of the gravity obstruction is created below the
U(1)anom gauge boson mass scale. Since the mother U(1)anom is a gauge symmetry, there is no gravity obstruction
of this U(1)PQ global symmetry. In string compactiﬁcation, it has been explicitly shown that the anomalies are the
same for all gauge groups both for non-Abelian and (properly normalized) Abelian gauge ﬁelds [31, 32]. Thus, the
compactiﬁcation of anomalous U(1) gauge symmetries can be gates to low energy gravity-safe global symmetries. In
the compactiﬁcation of Type-I and Type-IIB string, there can be three anomalous U(1)’s [38], where however the full
phenomenologically acceptable σMSSM spectrum of matter ﬁelds are not presented, which forbids us from calculating
caγγ. Here, we restrict to the case of Bµν from the heterotic string.

Let the anomalous gauge symmetry be U(1)anom.

Its charge operator and the coupling constant be Γ and eΓ,
respectively. The potential which is invariant under U(1)anom is also invariant under the global symmetry U(1)Γ
whose charge generator is also Γ. To see the eﬀective global symmetry below the anomalous scale, therefore, it is
suﬃcient to see how the local transformation is described. Since the longitudinal degree of the U(1)anom gauge boson
is solely provided by Bµν , matter scalars having the nonvanishing Γ charge do not develop VEVs. To see the U(1)anom
gauge transformation of a complex scalar Φ, consider the kinetic energy term (DµΦ)∗(DµΦ) where Dµ = ∂µ − ieΓΓAµ.
The gauge transformation Φ → eiα(x)Φ leads the kinetic energy term to

(∂µΦ∗ + ieΓΓAµΦ∗)(∂µΦ − ieΓΓAµΦ) + (eiα∂µe−iα)Φ∗(∂µΦ − ieΓΓAµΦ)
+ (e−iα∂µeiα)(∂µΦ∗ + ieΓΓAµΦ∗)Φ + (∂µe−iα)(∂µeiα)Φ∗Φ.

(5)

If we consider the global transformation U(1)Γ below the anomalous scale, only the ﬁrst term survives in the above
equation,

U(1)Γ Φ :

(∂µΦ∗ + ieΓΓ ˜Z µΦ∗)(∂µΦ − ieΓΓ ˜ZµΦ)

(6)

where we expressed the U(1)anom gauge boson as ˜Z. Below the anomalous scale, it describes a global symmetry
U(1)Γ coupling with the heavy anomalous gauge boson with the same charge Γ. In the potential V , this gauge boson
coupling respects the global symmetry also. Thus, we obtain an exact global symmetry U(1)Γ below the anomalous
scale.

Thus, an intermediate scale global symmetry is from the anomalous U(1)anom in the compactiﬁcation process of
the heterotic string. Since the anomalous U(1)anom has the same coupling to gauge ﬁelds, we have the following MI
axion coupling,

C. The weak mixing angle in GUTs with extra U(1)’s

If the electromagnetic charge operator is embedded in a simple GUT group SU(N ), the charge operator on the

fundamental representation is a traceless matrix,

Qem(N) = diag. (a, a, a, 0, −1, b6, · · · ), 3a − 1 +Xi

bi = 0.

(10)

In the Georgi-Glashow (GG) SU(5) model [36], a = 1
3 and bi = 0. If Qem is completed by the simple SU(N ) generators,
the information on the fundamental representation is enough since the other higher dimensiomnal representations can
be constructed in terms of direct products of fundamentals. At the GUT scale three gauge couplings are the same,
and the mixing angle is deﬁned as sin θW = e/g2. For properly normalized generators Q1 and T3 in the fundamental
representation, the trace is 1

2 , and we have

where g1 = g2 at the GUT scale. Thus, we obtain

Tr (eQem)2 = Tr (g1Q1)2 = Tr (g2T3)2,

sin2 θW =

e2
g2
2

=

Tr (T3)2
Tr (Qem)2 .

(11)

(12)

For the SU(5) model, it is (1/2)/(4/3) = 3/8. For the electromagnetic charge (10) in SU(N ), the mixing angle is

The SU(7) model of Ref. [37] gives sin2 θW = 3/20.

sin2 θW =

1/2

3a2 + 1 +Pi b2

i

.

(13)

If electromagnetically neutral SU(3)c × SU(2)W × U(1)Y singlets are added to the ﬁfteen chiral ﬁelds of SU(5),
the weak mixing angle presented in Eq. (12) remains the same. We can present the following general statement.
Suppose that a GUT group breaks at one scale MGUT and matter ﬁelds breaks down to 45 chiral ﬁelds of the SM
plus SU(3)c × SU(2)W × U(1)Y singlets,

(14)

L, dc

L, ℓL, νL, eL, ec

3(cid:8)qL, uc

L(cid:9) + singlets, at MGUT.

Then, Eq. (12) can be applied. Therefore, the SO(10) GUT has the weak mixing angle sin2 θW = 3
8 . It does not
depend on how the symmetry breaking chain takes, through the GG SU(5) or through the ﬂipped SU(5) [35, 39],
because there is only one scale MGUT. In the ﬂipped-SU(5), there are three fermionic representations, 10+1/5, 5−3/5,
and 1+1. If we consider all representations, Eq. (12) is still applicable.

However, if there are two scales for the symmetry breaking pattern such as SO(10) → ﬂipped-SU(5) → SM, the
weak mixing angle at the lower GUT scale has a logarthmic correction because U(1)em is composed of two U(1)’s. For
the electromagnetic charge operator composed of two U(1) couplings, i.e. e2
(1′) from U(1)′
part, the electromagnetic charge is given by

N from SU(N ) part and e2

(15)

If a vectorlike representation of the form 5−a + 5a is present in the model, then Eq. (12) is still applicable [32]. But,
if 5 or 5 does not appear in the anomaly-free combination as that from 16, that fundamental representation cannot
be used in Eq. (12). The Higgs 5−2/5 and 52/5 in the ﬂipped-SU(5) gives sin2 θW = 3

8 via Eq. (15).

The deﬁnition of c3 and c0

aγγ given in Eq. (1) dictates that fa is the vacuum expectation value hσi divided by the
domain wall number NDW. c0
aγγ is deﬁned relative to c3 with c3 taking into account NDW. For three fundamental
representations, c3 is three times that of one fundamemental, and also c0
aγγ is three times that of one fundamemental.
The color coupling deﬁnes fa as hσi/NDW. Thus, c0
aγγ = Tr (Qem)2/Tr (F3)2 where
F3 is one generator of color gauge group SU(3)c. For a fundamental representation, Tr (F3)2 = Tr (T3)2 where T3 is
one generator of weak gauge group SU(2)W , and we obtain

aγγ is deﬁned relative to c3, i.e. c0

c0
aγγ =

Tr (Qem)2
Tr (T3)2 =

(16)

6

if one fundamental representation is enough to calculate c0
contribution from three families

aγγ. Because the SM, represented in Eq. (14), has the

Tr (Qem)2
Tr (F3)2 =

,

the extra charged singlets will make this contribution larger. Therefore, GUTs predict

c0
aγγ ≥

.

(17)

(18)

Thus, we have the excluded region for the case of anomalous U(1) being U(1)PQ in Fig. 2. However, if U(1)PQ is
approximate as calculated in a string compactiﬁcation [34], this bound does not apply.

III. A SIMPLE CALCULATION OF c0

aγγ FROM QUANTUM NUMBERS

In this section, we show a simple method for calculating the entries in the DFSZ models in Table I. Let the invisible
axion is housed in the complex singlet σ [1]. The DFSZ model connects the PQ charges of Hu and Hd to that of σ.
One possible connection is

and the PQ charge Γ of σ is assigned to be +1. The mass terms of the up- and down- type quarks are

HuHd σ2,

H †

u ¯uRqL, H †

d

¯dRqL,

(19)

(20)

where qL and ℓL are SU(2)W doublets.

If the charged leptons obtain mass by Hd via H †

d ¯eRℓL, we can assign the charges of Hu, qL, ℓL, and uR zero. Then,
Hd carries −2 units of the charge. The charges of dR and eR are +2. Certainly, this deﬁnition is free of gauge charges
since fermions dR and eR, having diﬀerent SM gauge charges, have the same charge. Namely, these charges do not
contain gauge charges. So, −2 is wholely the global PQ charge. Thus, Γ − Qem − Qem anomaly is proportional to
+2e2[3(−1/3)2 + (−1)2] = 8e2

3 , which is used in the table for (dc, e) uniﬁcation.

If the charged leptons obtain mass by Hu via ˜H †

u¯eRℓL, we can assign the PQ charges of Hd, qL, ℓL, and dR zero.
Since Hu carries −2 units of the PQ charge, the PQ charge of uR is +2, and the PQ charge of eR is −2. Thus,
Γ − Qem − Qem anomaly is proportional to +2e2[3(+2/3)2 − (−1)2] = 2e2
3 , which is used in the table for (uc, e)
uniﬁcation. In SUSY models, Hu cannot be used for the electron mass due to the holomorphic condition and the
weak hypercharge.

IV. CONCLUSION

For the exact global symmetry U(1)PQ from string compactiﬁcation, we obtained the lower bound, 8

aγγ ≃ 2. This bound is free from the gravity obstruction of global
