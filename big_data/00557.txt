We propose a general theory for surface patterning in many diﬀerent biological systems, including
mite and insect cuticles, pollen grains, fungal spores, and insect eggs. The patterns of interest are
often intricate and diverse, yet an individual pattern is robustly reproducible by a single species
and a unique set of developmental stages produces a variety of patterns. We argue that the pattern
diversity and reproducibility may be explained by interpreting the pattern development as a ﬁrst-order
phase transition to a spatially modulated phase. Brazovskii showed that for such transitions on a
ﬂat sheet, the patterns are uniform-striped or hexagonal. Biological objects, however, have ﬁnite
extent and oﬀer diﬀerent topologies, such as the spherical surfaces of pollen grains. We consider
Brazovskii transitions on spheres and show that the patterns have a richer phenomenology than
simple stripes or hexagons. We calculate the free energy diﬀerence between the unpatterned state
and the many possible patterned phases, taking into account ﬂuctuations and the system’s ﬁnite
size. The proliferation of variety on a sphere may be understood as a consequence of topology, which
forces defects into perfectly ordered phases. The defects are then accommodated in diﬀerent ways.
We also argue that the ﬁrst-order character of the transition is responsible for the reproducibility
and robustness of the pattern formation.

these counter-intuitive features relies upon ﬂuctuation
eﬀects leading to global pattern nucleation.

We focus on a class of biological surface patterns ob-
served in many disparate taxa (fungi, arachnids, insects,
angiosperms) consisting of spikes, hexagons and stripes of
cross-linked polysaccharide material uniformly tiled on a
spherical cell. The surface pattern formation of these bio-
logical systems typically involves many cell components,
including the cytoskeleton, plasma membrane, and cell
wall (callose wall in pollen, cuticle in arthropod cuticles
and fungal spores) [23, 24, 29]. Without some physical
coupling, coordination among these many parts would
require complex biological signalling across large regions
of the organism. Hence, the patterns seem more plausibly
to develop via a simple physical process. We are already
familiar with complex, self-organized patterning via rela-
tively simple processes in the natural world: convection
cells at a Rayleigh-B´enard instability [15], the patterning
of pigments in animals [18], and hexagonal patterning of
dried mud or the basalt columns of the Giant’s Causeway
[13].

While patterning on ﬂat, planar substrates is expected
to yield striped or hexagonal patterns [5], we will demon-
strate that the analogous transition on a sphere has a
much richer phenomenology. The spherical geometry
introduces topological defects, yielding a varied set of pat-
tern possibilities. Also, since the transition we describe
here has a ﬁrst-order character, it is possible to produce
a particular pattern by templating a small patch, which
would then induce pattern growth over the entire surface
via nucleation dynamics [15]. The patterning inside the
nucleation region itself could be controlled by local surface
chemistry of the plasma membrane, allowing for pattern
reproducibility within a species.

While our theory may be applicable in any of the bio-
logical cases stated above, for simplicity we consider the
biochemical details of pollen below, as shown in Fig 1(a),

FIG. 1.
(a) Electron micrographs of pollen grains. The surface
coat of the pollen, called exine, exhibits diﬀerent patterns,
ranging from stripes and many diﬀerent patchy arrangements.
Appearing below each micrograph is a corresponding height
function representation constructed from our theory with the
indicated spherical harmonics. (b) The left panel shows a
micrograph of pollen grain cells early in development. The
plasma membrane of the cells undulates (yellow arrow) with a
length-scale consistent with the ﬁnal patterning of the mature
pollen grain shown in the right panel.

Surface patterning in many animal and plant species,
including insect eggshells, pollen grains, fungal spores,
and mite carapaces, may be extremely diverse. Stripes,
spikes, pores, ridges, and other decorations [2, 20], illus-
trated for pollen in Fig. 1(a), all present very diﬀerent
geometries. Paradoxically, the distinct morphologies may
develop via the same sequence of developmental stages
[3, 9–11], though the patterns are distinctive enough to
be used for taxonomic classiﬁcation over aeons. In this
paper, we propose a general model of the formation of
these patterns, and speculate that the origin of some of

and will refer to the general case of such decorated cells
as pollen. The earliest indication of patterning in pollen
begins with plasma membrane undulations [24], as shown
in Fig. 1(b). This distortion of the local membrane curva-
ture is also implicated in other iterations of this pattern
forming process, such as insect and arachnid cuticle de-
velopment [12, 23]. Here, we present a model for pattern
formation via a phase transition at the plasma membrane.
We show that the characteristic size of the membrane
undulations, λ, is a function of physical parameters of the
membrane. Hence, the membrane tension and elasticity,
lipid and protein density, or osmolarity of the surround-
ing ﬂuid could all vary among species and contribute
to diversity in the ﬁnal, observed cuticle and cell wall
patterns.

Mechanical buckling is another microscopic mechanism
that may plausibly cause surface patterns in the biological
systems. However, we believe our model of pattern forma-
tion may be especially applicable to systems like pollen,
since the transition to patterning may occur locally, with-
out the homogeneous long-range forces in existing models
of elastic buckling [8]. Another characteristic suggestive
of a phase transition is that all these systems have a
cross-linked polymeric layer secreted on the surface of the
cell membrane.

We will derive from the microscopic model a more gen-
eral, coarse-grained description, which will turn out to
be the spherical analog of the Brazovskii model [5]. Such
models describe a wide variety of systems [28], including
block copolymer assembly [4], crystallizing Bose-Einstein
condensates in optical cavities [14], and cholesteric and
smectic liquid crystals [6]. Such systems on a sphere might
also be excellent experimental test-beds for our theory.
Though there have been recent numerical investigations
of copolymer assembly on a sphere via self-consistent
ﬁeld theory [7], our analysis goes beyond self-consistent
ﬁeld theory by incorporating ﬂuctuations and provides a
broader understanding of such transitions through ana-
lytical methods.

I. A MICROSCOPIC MODEL

As a microscopic model, consider a concentration ﬁeld Ψ
on the plasma membrane that might describe, for example,
the concentration of a compound (or a deviation above or
below some baseline value) that eventually coordinates the
deposition of the tough sporopollenin exterior, e.g., the
underlying primexine matrix [29]. The pattern formation
will be driven by phase separation of the concentration
Ψ at the plasma membrane surface. Hence, we have a
general Landau-Ginzburg free energy for Ψ:
HΨ =

where K0, and λ3,4 are coupling constants that depend
on the speciﬁc compound and associated biochemistry

(1)

2

and we assume that K0, λ4 > 0. The temperature-like
parameter τ0 is quenched from positive to negative values
(or below some critical value) during pattern formation.
Since the ﬁeld Ψ lives on a spherical surface, we employ

spherical coordinates Ψ = Ψ(θ, φ). The integration(cid:82) d2x
in Eq. 1 is the appropriate spherical measure (cid:82) d2x =
R2(cid:82) dθdφ sin θ where R is the radius of the sphere. We

expand Ψ(θ, φ) (where θ ∈ [0, π] and φ ∈ [0, 2π) are,
respectively, the colatitude and longtiude):

Ψ(θ, φ) =

where Y m
(cid:96) (θ, φ) are the spherical harmonics, and
(cid:96) = ((cid:96), m) is a convenient notation for their indices. Since
the scalar ﬁeld Ψ is real, the expansion coeﬃcients satisfy
the property [Ψm
. The Landau-Ginzburg
theory in Eq. 1 favors modes with (cid:96) = 0, which correspond
to uniform states. A patterned phase would prefer to
have some (cid:96) (cid:54)= 0 that minimizes the free energy. The
key ingredient will be the coupling of the ﬁeld Ψ to the
membrane curvature. The ﬂat, inﬁnite membrane analog
of our model is studied in detail in [19], which we will
follow closely for our spherical model.

(cid:96)

The membrane itself ﬂuctuates away from its spherical
shape, so that the radius varies with θ and φ, r(θ, φ) =
R[1 + u(θ, φ)]ˆr. The ﬂuctuation ﬁeld u may also then
be expanded in spherical harmonics with modes um
(cid:96) , as
in Eq. 2. Though there are many possible models for
spherical lipid membranes, outlined in [27], for example,
the speciﬁc form does not matter for our purposes, since
the result will be general. All models will typically have
a bending term with a bending rigidity κ and a surface
tension σ. Generically, the ﬁeld Ψ couples to the ﬁeld u
by introducing a spontaneous curvature: it is reasonable
that the inhomogeneity introduced by a local excess of Ψ
causes the membrane to bulge in or out locally. Apart
from an irrelevant additive constant, a particular bending
energy and the membrane coupling term look like
Hmem =

where the (cid:96) = 0 mode is removed by constraining the
total volume of the vesicle and the (cid:96) = 1 mode is removed
because it corresponds to translations of the entire mem-
brane. The coupling µ will depend on the microscopic
details of how the spontaneous curvature is induced by
the inhomogeneity.
Our total, microscopic free energy is Htot = Hmem+HΨ.
We can calculate thermal averages of interest using the
standard Boltzmann weights. Moreover, we can generate
an eﬀective free energy for the density ﬁeld Ψ by integrat-
ing out the membrane degrees of freedom. Fortunately,
because those degrees of freedom only appear quadrat-
ically in Htot, we can perform this integration exactly,

leaving an eﬀective free energy (cid:101)H for just the ﬁeld Ψ:

where ω((cid:96)) is now a function of the mode number (cid:96) and
the λ3,4 coupling terms Hint are inherited from Eq. 1.

√

Crucially, ω((cid:96)) develops a minimum at a non-zero value
of (cid:96) whenever the spontaneous curvature term is strong
enough: µ >
K0σ. Thus, this simple coupling to
membrane ﬂuctuations leads to a spatially modulated
phase with a characteristic mode number (cid:96) = (cid:96)0 ≈

R[(µ(cid:112)σ/K0 − σ)/κ]1/2. The number (cid:96)0 = 0, 1, 2, . . .

approximately describes the number of pattern oscilla-
tions/wavelengths that ﬁt in a sphere circumference. As
we can see from Fig. 1, we will typically have (cid:96)0 (cid:29) 1.
We may also relate (cid:96)0 to the characteristic wavelength
λ of the pattern, since (cid:96)0 ≈ 2πR/λ. A rough estimate
of λ using typical parameters for lipid membranes gives
the right order of magnitude for pollen pattern features
(λ ∼ 0.1 − 1 µm) [19, 25].

The preceding discussion shows that the eﬀective free
(cid:96) near (cid:96) ≈ (cid:96)0 has the general

energy for the ﬁeld modes Ψm

where K and τ are new coupling constants that depend
on the microscopic parameters in Eq. 1 and Eq. 3 [19].
The interaction terms Hint continue to be inherited from
Eq. 1. The key feature of the eﬀective free energy in Eq. 6
is the gradient term (the term depending explicitly on (cid:96))
that is minimized when Ψ is modulated on the lengthscale
λ ≈ 2πR/(cid:96)0. This means that the physics of the pattern
formation will be dominated by ﬂuctuations at a non-zero
momentum.

Before continuing, we note that the precise microscopic
model for pollen is not known, and there are many pos-
sibilities [26, 29]. However, our ﬁnal result in Eq. 6 is
not contingent on the particular details of our phase sep-
aration model, and we expect that the coarse-grained
features of many microscopic models will obey Eq. 6, but
with diﬀerent dependencies of the coupling constants K,
τ , and λ3,4 on the microscopic parameters. In any case,
the ﬁeld Ψ will describe the pattern template on which
the tough sporopollenin material is deposited. Hence, a
height function representation of this ﬁeld away from a
reference sphere conﬁguration may qualitatively describe
the ﬁnal deposited pattern, as shown in Fig. 1(a). We
will now use the ﬁnal result in Eq. 6 to demonstrate that
robustness and variability are general features of the pat-
tern formation. In the following, we set K = 1 without
loss of generality. We begin by showing that the model

indicate, respectively, regions of maximal and minimal values
of the ordered state ¯Ψ. For this table, we have chosen a linear
combination of cm’s with m = 4, 5, 7 and phases determined
by the triple (θ4, θ5, θ7) appearing above each plot. In the
bottom row, we highlight a particular region of the pattern as
we vary one of the phases. We expect these multi-mode states
to be metastable. Changing the phases substantially alters
the pattern.

generically has a ﬁrst-order transition, as in the ﬂat case
[5].

As in the ﬂat case [5], ﬂuctuations will induce phase
transitions to ordered states. In preparation, we expect
ordered states of the form

where a ≥ 0 is an overall amplitude and cm are (generally
complex) functions of m that indicate the direction of
the ordered state in the 2(cid:96)0 + 1-dimensional space of
m’s. An ordered state consisting of a single spherical
harmonic mode contribution (cm (cid:54)= 0 for a single m) is
ˆk · x) considered
the analog of the striped phase cos(k0
by Brazovskii. The spherical harmonics encode the non-
trivial topological features of the sphere. For example, any
kind of striped ordering on a sphere must have defects
according to the Poincar´e-Brouwer theorem [17]. The
spherical harmonics naturally include these defects. For
example, the m = 0 harmonics have latitudinal stripes
with +1 defects at the poles. Although some progress
has been made in identifying what spatially modulated
patterns can form on a sphere at some ﬁxed (cid:96)0, those
analyses have been largely limited to looking at particular
lower order modes (cid:96)0 <∼ 12 [7, 21]. We will consider the
problem for general (cid:96)0. The sphere radius R will introduce
a new lengthscale into the problem and ﬁnite size eﬀects
at small R. In the following we will construct ﬁnite-size
crossover scaling functions which capture both the large
and small R behavior at ﬁxed pattern wavelength.

II. FLUCTUATION-INDUCED FIRST ORDER

TRANSITION

Consider the transition to an ordered state in our gen-
eral free energy in Eq. 6. The interaction terms Hint
include both a cubic and a quartic term. A cubic term
alone would induce a ﬁrst-order transition to an ordered
phase, which would likely be mediated via a nucleation
process. However, when λ3 = 0 (see Eq. 1), we expect
a second-order transition. This λ3 = 0 case may be es-
pecially important for our systems because it is known
that the plasma membrane may tune itself to a special
critical point which does not have a cubic term [31]. If
we set λ3 = 0 and pick some λ4 > 0, mean-ﬁeld theory
predicts a change in the character of the potential energy,
τ Ψ2/2 + λ4Ψ4/4!, when τ changes signs. When τ > 0, the
potential has a minimum at Ψ = 0. However, when τ < 0,

the minimum shifts to a non-zero Ψ ∝(cid:112)−6τ /λ4. This

is where we expect the ordered state to appear. Such a
transition is second-order in nature because the amplitude
of the ﬁeld changes continuously as we vary τ . In this situ-
ation, the patterned and un-patterned state minima never
coexist and the pattern would have to develop homoge-
neously over the entire sphere surface, with no nucleation
process. However, we shall see that ﬂuctuations modify
this picture and instead induce a ﬁrst-order transition.

To facilitate computations, it is convenient to deﬁne a

for which rapid evaluation algorithms are available [16].
We will follow Brazovskii’s calculation and make use of a
Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation in which the corrections
due to ﬂuctuations are calculated self-consistently using
a particular subset of Feynman diagrams. The details
of the calculation are given in the appendices. We will
always work in the limit that the coupling coeﬃcients
λ3,4 are small.

The HF approximation of the renormalized propaga-
tor is written as a self-consistency condition on td, the
ﬂuctuation-renormalized value of τ in the disordered state:

The summation over (cid:96) in Eq. 13 is the discrete analog
of an integration of the propagator over all modes (i.e.,
a one-loop correction). The prime on the sum indicates
a regularization procedure where the divergence associ-
ated with large (cid:96) is removed. The speciﬁc regulariza-
tion procedure only modiﬁes the short wavelength (large
(cid:96)) physics, and is irrelevant for the coarse-grained fea-
tures of the pattern formation. Also, the contribution
from the cubic interaction is negligible for (cid:96)0 (cid:29) 1 (see
Appx. B). Note that the function in Eq. 13 captures both
td (cid:29) 1 and a small radius
a large radius regime, πR
td (cid:28) 1. Thus, the correction crosses over
regime πR
√
to a ﬁnite-size dominated behavior when the correlation
length ξ ≈ 1/
td of ﬂuctuations becomes large enough
to sense the ﬁnite size of the system: ξ (cid:29) πR. The
cross-over length πR is the sphere’s pole-to-pole distance.
Equation 13 admits only positive solutions for td for any
value of τ . Hence, ﬂuctuations prevent the temperature-
like term from changing sign. If a cubic term were present,
then a ﬁrst-order transition is possible if λ3 < 0 and td is
suﬃciently small. However, if λ3 = 0, then the only possi-
bility for any transition is if the quartic term proportional
to λ4 is driven negative. We must therefore consider the
λ3 = 0 case in more detail to ﬁnd which modes have a
ﬂuctuation-induced sign change in the quartic term.

The three m-dependent Gaunt coeﬃcient terms in
Eq. 14 are three diﬀerent angular momentum “channels”
which contribute to the vertex. A single momentum chan-
nel contributes whenever m1 (cid:54)= ±m2, so that the two
terms in the second line of Eq. 14 vanish. Then, the
renormalized vertex Γ(4)
has the same sign as the bare
(cid:96)0
vertex γ(4) in Eq. 10 (since λ4Π((cid:96)) > 0 for all (cid:96)). However,
if m1 = ±m2, then one of the other two channels start to
contribute. There is also a special case for which all three
channels contribute: m1 = m2 = m3 = m4 = 0. Note
from the second line of Eq. 14 that if two or more channels
contribute and if λ4Π((cid:96)) > 1, the renormalized vertex
function changes sign! This indicates the possibility of
a ﬁrst order transition for these m1 = ±m2 modes with
(cid:96) = (cid:96)0. They are, in fact, the modes we have considered
already in Eq. 7 and are the spherical analogs of the cosine
standing waves of the ﬂat space Brazovskii analysis.

We now examine the most divergent piece of the ﬂuctu-
ation correction Π((cid:96)) to see if we generically expect that
λ4Π((cid:96)) > 1. The most divergent part of the correction
occurs when (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 ≈ (cid:96)0 in Eq. 15. Setting (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2,
we ﬁnd that Π((cid:96)) diverges as td → 0 as Π((cid:96)) ∼ t

since Π((cid:96)) → ∞ as td → 0, the vertex function for the

ﬂuctuations, consistent with the Brazovskii result.

We have now shown that our model generically exhibits
a ﬁrst-order transition to a patterned phase. In the ab-
sence of a cubic term in the terms Hint, this transition
is particularly interesting as the ﬁrst-order character is
induced by ﬂuctuations. We will now calculate the free
energies of the ordered states. We will ﬁnd that diﬀer-
ences between plane waves in the plane and spherical
harmonics on the sphere lead to a much richer variety of
possible states – the zoo of pollen patterns!

III. PATTERNED STATES

(cid:96) = ψm

We now consider an ordered state ¯Ψ that minimizes the
thermodynamic potential with non-vanishing spherical
harmonic coeﬃcients ¯Ψm
(cid:96) . We expand our ﬁeld around
(cid:96) + ¯Ψm
this state, Ψm
(cid:96) , where ψm
(cid:96) are the ﬂuctuations
around the potential minimum ¯Ψ, i.e., (cid:104)ψm
(cid:96) (cid:105) = 0. In order
to determine whether an ordered state is more stable than
a disordered state, we need to generate the eﬀective free
energy as a function of the average ﬁeld conﬁguration,
W [ ¯Ψ]. To do this, we add an external ﬁeld h to H, and
calculate the partition function as a function of h to
generate the free energy, F [h]. A Legendre transform

5

W [ ¯Ψ] = F [h] +(cid:82) d2x h ¯Ψ, where h satisﬁes ¯Ψ = −δF/δh,

generates W [ ¯Ψ] – from this we can calculate the free
energy of various states ¯Ψ. This is diﬃcult to implement,
so we follow Brazovskii’s ingenious approximation method
for calculating the free energy diﬀerence per unit area,
∆Φ, between the ordered and disordered states.
Through a change of variables in the functional integral
for the partition function, we expand H in powers of ψ
around ¯Ψ resulting in a theory for the modes ψm
(cid:96) , the
ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom. We then relate h to ¯Ψ to
lowest order, leading to a linearized theory for h [5]. Since
the unstable modes have (cid:96) = (cid:96)0, we may parameterize
≡ ¯Ψm = acm. We are now
the modes as in Eq. 7: ¯Ψm
(cid:96)0
set to calculate the free energy change ∆Φ between the
disordered and patterned states. To do this, we start in
the disordered state where ¯Ψ = 0 and apply an external
ﬁeld h to tilt the potential so that, for h large enough, the
ordered state becomes the minimum and then return h
to 0. During this process, the amplitude a changes from
a = 0 to a ﬁnal a = ¯a. The ﬁnal state must also be an
extremum of the free energy at h = 0 – another minimum.
The diﬀerence in free energy then tells us whether the
ordered state is more or less stable than the disordered
state.

A ﬁeld h in the direction of the state ¯Ψ will have
spherical harmonic modes hm (with (cid:96) = (cid:96)0) that couple
linearly to ¯Ψm in the free energy. An equation of state
for hm is constructed by diﬀerentiating the average free
energy per unit area Φ with respect to ¯Ψm and averaging
(cid:96) (cid:105) = 0,
over the ﬂuctuations ψ. Dropping terms using (cid:104)ψm
(cid:105), which we
as well as terms of the form (cid:104)ψm1
expect to be small for similar reasons as in the Brazovskii
analysis [5], we have:

where the average is taken with respect to the Hamilto-
nian without an applied ﬁeld. A detailed expansion in
terms of ¯Ψ can be found in the appendices, Eq. C22. To
simplify calculations and facilitate analytic solutions, we
consider the states which satisfy this condition by pair-
wise cancellation of two of the modes, e.g., via m1 = −m2
and m3 = 0.
Calculating the ﬂuctuation-corrected free energy re-
quires the ﬂuctuation-corrected two-point function g ≡
g((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2) = (cid:104)ψm1

The major diﬀerence between this propagator and the

¯Ψ = acm through an amplitude a that will increase from
a = 0 to a = ¯a. Since the ﬁnal state must correspond
to a free energy minimum after the ﬁeld h is turned oﬀ,
¯Ψm = ¯acm must satisfy Eq. 18 with hm = 0 for all m. A
convenient choice for the ﬁnal amplitude is ¯a2 = 4πto/λ4.
The coeﬃcients cm are calculated by setting hm = 0
and ¯Ψm = ¯acm in Eq. 18.
In the absence of a cubic
term (λ3 = 0), the solution is particularly simple. Either
cm = 0 or

|cm|2 =

(3 − δm)α(cid:96)0

.

(20)

Note that only the magnitude |cm| of the mode directions
is speciﬁed. Thus, ordered states with diﬀerent relative
phases in the cm’s all have the same energy, as shown in
Fig. 2. Other ordered states are shown in Fig. 1(a). When
λ3 (cid:54)= 0, the coeﬃcients cm may be solved for numerically,
but we again ﬁnd that only the magnitudes |cm| are
speciﬁed for the m > 0 coeﬃcients. Hence, there remains
a large degeneracy of possible patterns due to the relative
phase freedom even when the cubic term is included: the
presence of explicit symmetry breaking does not alter
the conclusion that pattern formation on the sphere is
diﬀerent than that on the plane.

That being said, we may construct ordered states with
arbitrary numbers of non-zero cm’s but only those com-
binations with ∆Φ < 0 for some negative value of τ
correspond to stable patterns. Integrating up the free
energy changes, we ﬁnd

where ∂a ¯Ψm = cm for our parameterization of the ordered
states. Substituting Eq. 16 into Eq. 21 yields a complex
expression for ∆Φ (shown in Appx. C, Eq. C32) – ﬁnding
the values of cm for which ∆Φ is negative allows us to
ﬁnd preferred ordered states. As an example, we plot ∆Φ
for diﬀerent ordered states with (cid:96)0 = 12 in Fig. 3.

vored ordered states are ones for which(cid:80)

Roughly speaking, we ﬁnd that when λ3 = 0 the most fa-
m |cm|2 >∼ 2. For
modest (cid:96)0 ∼ 10, we ﬁnd that single mode solutions with
m ≈ (cid:96)0/2 work best, as illustrated in Fig. 3. At higher
values (cid:96)0 >∼ 30, the latitudinal and longitudinal striped
solutions with two modes (m ≈ 0, 1 and m = (cid:96)0− 1, (cid:96)0, re-
spectively) work best. For even larger (cid:96)0, the coeﬃcients
m,m ∼ ln (cid:96)0. This means
α(cid:96)0
m,m in Eq. 20 behave like α(cid:96)0
that the ordered states include more modes, allowing for
the possibility of diﬀerent patterns with equivalent energy
(see Fig. 2). In the presence of a cubic term, however,
hexagonally-patterned states are favored, as shown for the
|m| = 0, 10 case in Fig. 3. Note that these states also have
defects. In any case, choosing diﬀerent values for (cid:96)0 yields
qualitatively diﬀerent stable patterns. This is in marked
contrast to the planar case, where the uniform striped
or hexagonal solutions are favored for any k0. Also note
from Fig. 3 that many diﬀerent ordered states yield a
negative ∆Φ, i.e., many diﬀerent patterns are metastable.

FIG. 3. Plot of the free energy diﬀerence ∆Φ between various
ordered, striped states and the disordered phase as a function
of the reduced temperature τ < 0 for (cid:96)0 = 12, R = 10, and
λ4 = 0.01. The plot legend shows which combination of m’s is
used. The cubic term coeﬃcient is set to zero except for the
|m| = 0, 10 case, for which λ3 = 0.015. When λ3 = 0, single
|m| ≈ (cid:96)0/2 modes are favored for these modest values of (cid:96)0. At
higher values of (cid:96)0, however, we ﬁnd that linear combinations
are more favorable, instead. The presence of a cubic term
favors the formation of phases with hexagonal patterns. As we
decrease the temperature (increasing −τ ), the ordered states
become more favorable. There are a wide variety of possible
ordered states, each corresponding to a local minimum in the
thermodynamic potential. Note that when ∆Φ > 0, there is
coexistence between the patterned phase and the disordered
one.

introduces a dependence on the directions m1,2. There
are also oﬀ-diagonal terms with m1 (cid:54)= −m2. These contri-
butions may be ignored as long as τ is suﬃciently small
[5], which we will assume in the following.
Substituting Eq. 17 into Eq. 16 and making an isotropic
approximation to the propagator g−1 [22], we eliminate
the τ -dependence in Eq. 16, leaving the following equation
of state:

This means that a pollen may, for example, locally ap-
ply an appropriate ﬁeld h via a biochemically-controlled
templating process to force the pattern into a particular
metastable ordered state. The pollen may then “quench”
this pattern, forcing it to spread over the surface via a
nucleation process.

In conclusion, we have developed a phenomenological
theory of pattern formation on a sphere. This theory
provides a plausible explanation of the physical origins
of micron-scale surface textures found on cell walls and
cuticles of distantly related taxa such as plants, mites,
fungi and insects. We showed how this mechanism may
originate in plasma membrane undulations that are cou-
pled to the phase separation of polysaccharide materials,
such as primexine in pollen development, which later co-
ordinate the deposition of a tough exterior wall. Our
theory predicts that the pollen grain surface is quenched
below a ﬁrst-order transition point during development,
and have argued that a patterned phase can spread after
the quench via a nucleation process. A given species may
specify one of these many patterned modes via a localized
nucleation site deﬁned by one or more of several possi-
ble cell-biological mechanisms. For example, a localized
nucleation site could be designated by the local surface
chemistry of the plasma membrane relative to one pole of
the cell, or by local crowding at the cell surface of nascent
pollen caused by ordered packing in the developing anther.
We showed that the ﬁrst-order character of the transition
will be maintained even when the free energy has no cubic
term. We also argued that the theory without a cubic
term may be particularly relevant because the plasma
membrane composition in vivo may be tuned to a critical
point.

While the ﬁrst-order character of this transition may
explain the reproducibility of a pattern in one species,
the theory may also provide an answer to why there is so
much pattern variability among diﬀerent species. First,
a wide variety of patterns is possible by modifying the
nucleation pattern, which, once formed, allows the rest
of the pattern to propagate rapidly and robustly across
the surface. Second, pattern formation on a sphere is
intrinsically varied because, in contrast to the planar
case, the ordered states on the sphere must accommodate
topological defects, providing a larger space of possible
patterns. By contrast, butterﬂy wing scale development
may be an example of patterning on a ﬂat substrate via
this mechanism; the distal surface of the wing scale forms
exclusively striped patterns and the plasma membrane
has also been implicated in the initial pattern templating
here [12].

There is much room for future work. For example,
it is not clear how to recover the single-mode, uniform
stripe solutions of the original Brazovskii theory in the
planar limit (leading to large pollen with many stripes)
in a transparent manner. The spherical harmonics always
have defects induced by the sphere topology, and we do
not understand their inﬂuence on the planar limit. It
would also be helpful to study the nucleation dynamics in

7

more detail in order to understand how a nucleation region
might be speciﬁed, leading to a particular global pattern.
There has already been progress on this in the planar case
[15], providing a starting point for the spherical case.

Appendix A: Useful Identities and Relations

In this Appendix we collect all the relevant Gaunt
coeﬃcient identities used in the calculations. Recall that
the Gaunt coeﬃcients in the main text were deﬁned as
follows

where the 2 by 3 matrices are the Wigner 3j-symbols,
which are related to the Clebsch-Gordon coeﬃcients used
for adding angular momenta in quantum mechanics [1].
We will now derive various identities for the Gaunt co-
eﬃcients from the known properties of the Wigner 3j-
symbols, which are familiar from the quantum mechanics
literature.

The Gaunt coeﬃcients which appear in Eq. A1 satisfy

triangle relations given by

m1,m2,m3

Υ(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2,(cid:96)3
Υ(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2,(cid:96)3

m1,m2,m3

= 0 if (cid:96)3 > |(cid:96)1 + (cid:96)2| or (cid:96)3 < |(cid:96)1 − (cid:96)2|
= 0 if m1 + m2 + m3 (cid:54)= 0

(A2)

(A3)

Furthermore, because the 3j-symbol is invariant under an
even permutation of its columns, and an odd permutation
generates an overall factor of (−1)(cid:96)1+(cid:96)2+(cid:96)3, the presence of
two such symbols in the Gaunt coeﬃcients means that the
latter coeﬃcients are invariant under any permutation of
the indices, i.e. Υ(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2,(cid:96)3
=
. . .. The second 3j-symbol in Eq. A1 has a special from
and implies the following selection rule:

= Υ(cid:96)1,(cid:96)3,(cid:96)2

= Υ(cid:96)3,(cid:96)2,(cid:96)1

m1,m2,m3

= 0 if (cid:96)1 + (cid:96)2 + (cid:96)3 is odd.

(A4)

The Gaunt coeﬃcients also obey a reﬂection property
(again due to a similar property of the 3j-symbol):

Υ(cid:96)1,(cid:96)2,(cid:96)3

m1,m2,m3

To expand the cubic and quartic terms in our Hamilto-
nian H (terms proportional to λ3,4 in Eq. 1 in the main
text), it is necessary to compute the integral of a product
of three and four spherical harmonics Y m
(cid:96) (θ, φ)
((cid:96) = 0, 1, 2, . . .; m = −(cid:96),−(cid:96) + 1, . . . , (cid:96)) over the spherical
coordinates θ (longitude) and φ (colatitude). To make our
notation more compact, we introduce a vector of indices
(cid:96) ≡ ((cid:96), m), so that summations over the indices may be

We now calculate the 2-point correlation function or
propagator gd and 4-point vertex function Γ(4) in the
disordered phase. We’ll put a subscript on the propagator
to distinguish it from the propagator in the ordered phase,
go, calculated in the next section. In the following we will
use standard diagrammatic techniques (see, e.g. [30]). To

parameter td (instead of τ ), where the subscript reminds
us that we are in the disordered state. Hence, when calcu-
lating the loop in Eq. B9, we have to replace the τ in the
original propagator with td. Using our Feynman rules,
this yields the following term:

To simplify formulae that appear throughout the rest of
this text, we make the deﬁnition M ((cid:96), τ ) = ((cid:96)−(cid:96)0)2 +τ R2.

Finally, we will sum over the angular momentum indices
(cid:96)i and mi of any internal lines (i.e., lines which connect
two vertices or the same vertex to itself). We can use
these simple diagram elements to construct a perturbation
expansion in the couplings λ3,4, which we take to be small.
Let’s begin with corrections to the inverse propagator.
Using the geometric series for the propagator [30], it is
possible to write the fully renormalized inverse propagator
diagramatically as follows:
d ((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2) ≡ (
g−1

)−1 − 1PI

)−1 = (

, (B7)

where the fully renormalized propagator is denoted by a
double line, and the second term on the right-hand side
is the sum of all the two-point amputated one-particle ir-
reducible (1PI) graphs. These are the graphs that cannot
be cut into two sub-graphs by removing a single prop-
agator link. There are many of these graphs that one
would have to calculate. However, we simplify the calcu-
lation by looking at just the one-loop correction. If we
include the cubic term, there are two diﬀerent kinds of
loop corrections:

+

(B8)

In Brazovskii’s analysis [5], he argues that the ﬁrst loop
correction may be neglected relative to the second in
Eq. B8 because the loop integration in the ﬁrst diagram
only contributes over a narrow set of directions. This is
more diﬃcult to see in our spherical harmonic expansion,
but we may neglect this diagram in our analysis, as well.
We shall return to this point later (see Eq. B23).

We can actually include an even larger set of diagrams
if we replace the propagator in the loop with the renor-
malized propagator g to yield a self-consistent equation:

(

)−1 ≈ (

)−1 −

,

(B9)

where we have neglected the ﬁrst loop diagram in Eq. B8
which we expect to be small. The renormalized propaga-
tor g in this approximation has a new temperature-like

where M (x, y) ≡ (x − (cid:96)0)2 + y. Note that the factor of
two which appears in Eq. B10 comes from the symmetry
factor of the diagram. Using Eq. A7 to sum on m, we

(B11)

where we used the special value of the Gaunt coeﬃcient
in Eq. A6 and identiﬁed L1 as the divergent summation
to be performed.

Now we must grapple with the sum L1 in Eq. B11.
There is a logarithmic divergence that occurs for large
(cid:96). To remedy this divergence, we introduce a large mo-
mentum cutoﬀ Λ. The summation over (cid:96) may then be
regularized using the Pauli-Villars technique [30] by in-
troducing a modiﬁed propagator:

gd((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2) → (−1)m1Λ2δ(cid:96)1−(cid:96)2δm1+m2

M ((cid:96)1, td)M ((cid:96)1, Λ2/R2)

.

(B12)

Note that we will take Λ (cid:29) (cid:96)0 to be very large, so that the
relevant physics around (cid:96) ≈ (cid:96)0 is not modiﬁed. With this
propagator, the summation in Eq. B11 is convergent and,
with some assistance from a computer algebra system
(Mathematica v10.1, Wolfram Research, Inc., Champaign,
IL), we compute

regularize L1 by subtracting oﬀ the logarithmic divergence,

introducing an appropriate counterterm [30]. Next, we
assume that (cid:96)0 (cid:29) 1, so that the argument of the digamma
functions in Eq. B13 is large and we may make use of an
asymptotic series for ψ(0)(z). This yields the regularized

Note that there are two important dimensionless parame-

td/(cid:96)0. When we take the
R → ∞ limit, we want to be sure to recover the correct
planar limit described by the original Brazovskii analysis
(adapted to two dimensions) [5]. To do this, we must take
(cid:96)0 → ∞ as R → ∞ such that (cid:96)0/R = k0 remains con-
stant. Recall that k0 = 2π/λ0 corresponds to the special
wavevector associated with the unstable wavelength λ0.
Moreover, since we are interested in small td where we
ﬁnd the largest contributions from ﬂuctuations, we may

Substituting Eq. B15 into Eq. B11 and evaluating the
latter equation at (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 = (cid:96)0 yields the self-consistent
equation for td in the main text (Eq. 13) via Eq. B9.
Alternatively, Eq. B9 may be written as an equation for
the ﬂuctuation-renormalized propagator gd ≡ gd((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2).
Note that this propagator is diagonal, i.e., it vanishes

The most divergent contribution to the sums over (cid:96)1,2 in
Eq. B19 comes from (cid:96)1 ≈ (cid:96)2 ≈ (cid:96)0. The Gaunt coeﬃcient
in Eq. B19 contains no divergences, so we will set (cid:96)1 =
(cid:96)2 = (cid:96)0 in this coeﬃcient. This leaves us with the single

Finally, let us return brieﬂy to our neglected loop cor-
rection to the propagator. Now that we have calculated

Appendix C: The Ordered State and ∆Φ

In this Appendix, we calculate the free energy change
∆Φ between the disordered state and the ordered one.
We’ll also develop our perturbation theory around the
ordered state ¯Ψ. Recall that in the ordered state, we have
to expand around a new potential minimum, so that our
Hamiltonian has a diﬀerent form and a diﬀerent set of
Feynman rules. First, instead of the ﬁelds Ψmi
, our new
(cid:96)i
ﬂuctuating ﬁelds are the modes ψmi
of the ﬂuctuations
(cid:96)i
ψ away from the ordered state ¯Ψ. The Hamiltonian
for these ﬂuctuating modes includes all of the terms in
the Hamiltonian in Eq. B1. However, there are new
cross terms coming from powers of the expanded modes
, which we will denote by ∆H. These
Ψmi
(cid:96)i
new terms are all non-linear in ψmi
, because the linear
(cid:96)i
terms vanish: The ﬁelds ψ describe ﬂuctuations away
from the potential minimum. So, we have

Note that we have also ignored all the terms that do not
depend on ψ, as these do not contribute to any correlation
functions of the ψ ﬁelds. These new terms introduce three
new kinds of vertices, with three or two legs which we
may contract. We denote these vertices as follows:

this scaling may be complicated by the presence of the
cubic term). Then, we may verify that the contribu-
tion from the three-point function λ4(cid:104)ψψψ(cid:105) is small rel-
ative to the two point function contribution λ4(cid:104)ψψ(cid:105) ¯Ψ:

is possible that this particular scaling fails if the cubic
coupling λ3 is suﬃciently large. We still expect to be
able to neglect the three-point function, because both
the leading order contribution to (cid:104)ψψψ(cid:105) and (cid:104)ψψ(cid:105) ¯Ψ are
proportional to the ordered state amplitude within our
approximation, so the three-point function should still
be relatively small. However, a detailed check is beyond
the scope of this analysis. So, following Brazovskii, we
now neglect the three-point function contribution, and
calculate the equation for the magnetic ﬁeld h:

where in the second line we retain just the terms in the
Hamiltonian expanded around the ordered state, H[ψ+ ¯Ψ],
which retain at least a single power of ¯Ψ, since we take
a functional derivative with respect to the ordered state
modes ¯Ψm. We also drop all terms that are linear in
the ﬂuctuations ψ, since (cid:104)ψ(cid:105) = 0 as discussed in the
main text. Our task now is to write hm just in terms
of the ordered state modes ¯Ψm and the renormalized
value of τ in the ordered state, to. Before proceeding,
we will make an approximation (partially justiﬁed below)
that only the diagonal components m1 = −m2 = m

ﬁelds will have (cid:96)i = (cid:96)0, so we may omit the index (cid:96) of
these modes in the following. When calculating averages
of the ﬁelds ψ, these two new vertices must be included in
the Feynman rules already deﬁned in the previous section.
The vertex in Eq. C2 is the next-lowest order con-
tribution to the three-point function (cid:104)ψψψ(cid:105) (after the
bare contribution from the cubic term which vanishes for
any (cid:96)0 > 0, anyway), while the vertex in Eq. C3 con-
tributes a new term to the propagator equation. Before
calculating any loop corrections, let’s study the scaling
properties of these two new vertices for small λ3. Re-
call from the main text that the ordered state ampli-
tude ¯a satisﬁes ¯a2 ≈ 4πto/λ4 when λ3 = 0 (see also
Eq. C23 below). Hence, the circles in the new vertices

will bring in scaling factors of ¯Ψ ∼ (cid:112)to/λ4 (although

approximation, however, must be justiﬁed as the ordered

where the external legs have indices (cid:96)1,2. This contribu-
tion is called the ordered state term in the main text (see
Eq. 17). As usual, this contribution will be important for
the special modes with (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 = (cid:96)0. A scaling analysis
at λ3 = 0 reveals that Eq. C9 is the most important
diﬀerence between the propagators in the ordered and
disordered states. The contribution from Eq. C9 scales
like λ4R2¯a2 ∼ R2to due to the presence of the ordered
−1/2
state legs. The loop corrections scale like λ4(cid:96)0Rt
for
o
to (cid:29) 1 and λ4(cid:96)0t−1
√
the planar limit R
for the ﬁnite
to (cid:28) 1 . So, loop corrections are
size scaling regime R
suppressed by the coupling constant λ4 relative to the
correction without any loops, and the latter is the largest
correction in this perturbative analysis. As discussed in
more detail below, we expect a similar suppression when
λ3 (cid:54)= 0, but will make no detailed checks.

The cubic term, Eq. C8, also contributes. However,
note that by the property of the Gaunt coeﬃcients, it
only contributes for a single, special non-zero ordered
state mode ¯Ψm with m = m1 + m2. Conversely, the term
in Eq. C9 will have contributions from all ordered state
modes. So, we will neglect this cubic term contribution
for now, and then check that this is reasonable approxi-
mation within our isotropic approximation (see Eq. C26).
The same argument applies for the last loop correction
in Eq. C7, which is also generated by the cubic term.
We expect it to be negligible relative to the other loop
contributions. For now, we focus on the contribution in
Eq. C9.
For ordered states with a single mode, ¯Ψm, the contribu-
tion in Eq. C9 vanishes except when m1 = −m2. We also
expect terms with m1 (cid:54)= −m2 to be suppressed because,

12

in the absence of a cubic term, they will only contribute
when they satisfy the sum rule m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 = 0
where m3,4 are indices which contribute to the ordered
state ¯Ψ. So, we will assume that our ordered state prop-
agator is diagonal, i.e., vanishes whenever m1 (cid:54)= −m2.
This approximation has an analogy in the Brazovskii anal-
ysis: the propagator corrections with external momenta
not adding up to zero (pointing in opposite directions)
are thrown out. So, our contribution of interest is

Let us now move on to the loop corrections.

The ﬁrst loop correction in Eq. C7 is the same Hartree-
Fock contribution we found for the disordered state in
Eq. B11. So, there is nothing new here except for a
replacement of td by to. However, we may rewrite the
contribution in a convenient way as follows:

γ(4)((cid:96)1, (cid:96)2, (cid:96)3, (cid:96)4)go((cid:96)3, (cid:96)4).

The ﬁrst new loop contribution in the ordered state is

We will now explicitly show that this loop correction
is negligible compared to Eq. C12 when λ3 = 0. First,
we look at the largest contribution from this term, which
happens near the region ¯(cid:96)1,2 ≈ (cid:96)0 in Eq. C13. As discussed
in the main text and above, we neglect the oﬀ-diagonal
contributions to the two-point function, so we may set the
external leg indices (cid:96)1,2 to (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 = (cid:96)0 and m1 = −m2.
We then ﬁnd an expression similar to the one for the
vertex correction in Eqs. B18, B20:

to >∼ 1 in the last line. In
where we have assumed πR
to (cid:28) 1, the expression in the last
the ﬁnite-size limit πR
line simply gets multiplied by a factor of 2. We plot this
ratio in Fig. 4(a) for a single non-zero ordered state mode
¯Ψm2 = ¯acm, for which ∆L = ∆L(m1, m2). To facilitate
rapid computation of the Gaunt coeﬃcients, we use a
fast numerical algorithm [16]. We ﬁnd that the ratio is
quite small (∆L (cid:28) 1) for most values of m1,2, except for
values of m1 that are close to −m2. This condition is the
analog of the special directions discussed by Brazovskii [5],
where the external momenta of the loop contribution in
Eq. C13 are aligned with the reciprocal lattice vectors of
the patterned phase. To check that ∆L indeed decreases
rapidly away from these special directions, we plot in
Fig. 4(b) the ratio of scattering functions A(cid:96)0(m1,−m1 +
∆m)/A(cid:96)0(m1,−m1), where ∆m is the distance away from
the special direction. We ﬁnd that as |∆m| increases, we
get a rapid decay in the scattering function A(cid:96)0. When
λ3 (cid:54)= 0, the ordered state amplitudes in the loop correction
might have a diﬀerent scaling, as discussed previously.
The particular directions cm will also change. However,
since the summations over the internal propagators in
the loops remain the same, we again expect to be able
to neglect the loop in Eq. C14 relative to Eq. C12 even
when λ3 (cid:54)= 0, but a detailed check is beyond the scope of
this paper.

Thus, we have (partially) justiﬁed our neglect of the
loop correction in Eq. C13 when computing the propagator
in the ordered state. This is also consistent with the
Brazovskii analysis. So, going back to our equation for
the propagator, we ﬁnd

where we have used Eq. C12 for the loop correction. It is
clear that Eq. C17 reduces to Eq. 17 in the main text if we
substitute in the expression for the bare vertex function
γ(4) in Eq. C17. Finally, we may evaluate the inverse
propagator at (cid:96)1 = (cid:96)2 = (cid:96)0 so that the inverse propagator
just picks out the ﬂuctuation-renormalized value of τ ,

that this factor is small for all directions except when m1 =
−m2. (b) The plotted ratio shows that the scattering function
A(cid:96)0 decays rapidly with increasing distance |∆m| away from
the special direction m1 = −m2.

where we have indicated the appropriate m indices on the
external legs of the diagram. This contribution includes
a special function A(cid:96)0(m1, m2) that introduces an m-
dependence to the diagram:

(C15)

Recognizing that | ¯Ψm2|2 ∼ ¯a2 ∼ to/λ4 in Eq. C14, it is
easy to see that this new loop correction scales in the same
way as the loop correction in Eq. C12. So, we will have
to analyze the function A(cid:96)0 in some detail to prove that,
much like in the Brazovskii analysis, Eq. C14 contributes
signiﬁcantly only for special values of m1: when m1 is
equal to one of the m’s that contributes to the ordered
state ¯Ψ.

We can check explicitly that Eq. C14 does not con-
tribute signiﬁcantly. The ratio of the two loop contri-
butions for an arbitrary state ¯Ψ with modes ¯Ψm = ¯acm
(where ¯a2 = 4πt0/λ4 and cm is given in Eq. 20 in the

o = (−1)m1R2to(m1)δm1+m2 . Note
denoted by to: g−1
that to will depend on the index m1, due to the ordered
state term in Eqs. C10. So, Eq. C17 reduces to:

The ordered state solutions in the presence of a cubic
term are more complicated, but we may still choose the
amplitude normalization ¯a2 = 4πto/λ4 without loss of
generality. The ordered state amplitudes in Eq. C23 de-
pend on the function to(m), which must be solved for
using Eq. C19. This could be done numerically, but we
will be interested in an analytically tractable approxima-
tion. Hence, to make progress, we look for an isotropic
approximation to Eq. C19 and replace to(m) with a con-
stant to. To do this, we must ﬁnd some m-independent
approximation to the coeﬃcient α(cid:96)0
m1,m in Eq. C19. The
simplest solution is to average α(cid:96)0
m1,m over all external
directions m1:

It is also worth noting that the ¯(cid:96) = 0 term in the
sum in the deﬁnition of α(cid:96)0
m1,m (Eq. C11) contributes
the most, as can be veriﬁed numerically. Then, since
4π(−1)m1+m2 Υ(cid:96)0,(cid:96)0,0
m2,−m2,0 = 1 for any m1,2, re-
placing α(cid:96)0
m1,m with 1 in Eq. C19 is a reasonable approx-
imation. After regularizing the propagator sum as in
the disordered state calculation (Eq. B15), we ﬁnd an
m-independent solution for to:

A similar neglect of the angular depedence of the mass
term occurs in the Brazovskii analysis, where it has been
shown that including the angular dependence does not
substantially change the results [22]. Finally, note that
the cubic term we have already thrown out (Eq. C8)
vanishes in this approximation because it contributes the
following to the renormalized parameter to:
¯Ψ0 ∝ δ(cid:96)0,

(cid:96)3,m1

which vanishes for any (cid:96)0 > 0. Similarly, the last loop
contribution in Eq. C7 vanishes in this isotropic approxi-
mation.

We now calculate the change in potential energy per
unit area ∆Φ in going from the disordered to the ordered
state. We recall that we “turn on” the ordered state
by applying the ﬁeld h, so that the ordered state modes
¯Ψm = acm have their amplitudes a increase from 0 to ¯a.
In a similar way, the renormalized parameter t changes

After some rearrangement and relabelling of indices, we
ﬁnd the loop correction term that may be conveniently
substituted into Eq. C6:

In the second equality of Eq. C22 we assumed the ordered
state modes ¯Ψmi cancel in pairs, so that mi = m for one
of the three modes in the summations over m1,2,3. Note
that this covers many possible cases because the sums
are constrained so that m1 + m2 + m3 = −m. Note that
cubic term cannot be neglected in this equation. It will
inﬂuence the nature of the ordered states chosen by the
system.

It is clear from Eq. C22 that ¯Ψm = 0 is a possible
solution to the equation hm = 0. However, there are
m (cid:54)= 0, corresponding
also the non-trivial solutions with ¯Ψ∗

from td to to. So, from Eq. 21 in the main text and
Eqs. C22, C23, we ﬁnd

which may be compared to Eq. 19 in the main text. We

In the planar limit, the free energy change in Eq. C32

because it depends on the directions cm of the spherical

that ∆Φ becomes negative for a suﬃciently negative pa-

with the solutions for the ordered states ¯Ψ to ﬁnd the
