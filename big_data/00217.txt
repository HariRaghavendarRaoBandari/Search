A CLASS OF GLOBALLY SOLVABLE MARKOVIAN QUADRATIC BSDE SYSTEMS

AND APPLICATIONS

HAO XING AND GORDAN ŽITKOVI ´C

ABSTRACT. We establish existence and uniqueness for a wide class of Markovian systems of back-
ward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) with quadratic nonlinearities. This class is character-
ized by an abstract structural assumption on the generator, an a-priori local-boundedness property,
and a locally-Hölder-continuous terminal condition. We present easily veriﬁable sufﬁcient condi-
tions for these assumptions and treat several applications, including stochastic equilibria in incom-
plete ﬁnancial markets, stochastic differential games, and martingales on Riemannian manifolds.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1. Backward Stochastic Differential Equations. Having appeared ﬁrst in their linear variant
in [Bis73], backward stochastic differential equations (BSDE) have been a subject of extensive
study since the seminal paper [PP90]. Given a time horizon T ∈ (0,∞) and a ﬁltered probability
space (Ω,F ,{Ft}t∈[0,T ], P) which satisﬁes the usual conditions, these equations take the following
form

Yt = G +ˆ T

t

f (s, Ys, Zs) ds +ˆ T

t

Zs dWs,

(1.1)

where W is a d-dimensional {Ft}t∈[0,T ]-Brownian motion, G ∈ FT an N-dimensional random
vector and f a (possibly random) function, called the generator. A solution to such an equation is a
pair (Y , Z) consisting of an N-dimensional semimartingale Y and an N × d-dimensional adapted
process Z which, together, satisfy (1.1) pathwise, a.s.

The existence- and uniqueness theory is well developed in the scalar (N = 1) setting. It origi-
nated with the Lipschitz-generator case treated in [PP90], continued in [LSM97] for merely contin-
uous generators with linear growth, and culminated with the treatment of quadratic nonlinearities
in [Kob00] and superquadratic nonlinearities in [DHB11]. A host of extensions, simpliﬁcations,
and applications, too numerous to list here, appeared in the literature since.

On the other hand, systems (N > 1) of BSDE - the focus of the present paper - pose a greater
challenge. Their successful treatment is one of the most important (and long-standing) open prob-
lems in the entire theory, as mentioned already by Peng in [Pen99]. While the case of a Lipschitz
generator was treated already in [PP90], the general, nonlinear, quadratically-growing case is still
open. One of the most well-known general-purpose results has been established in [Tev08], where

the generator has general quadratic growth, but the terminal condition is subject to a restrictive
“smallness” assumption imposed on its L∞-norm. As is the case in the theory of systems of par-
abolic PDEs with quadratic nonlinearities, a smallness assumption is often made and seems to
be necessary for existence in full generality, in absence of any further, structural assumptions; cf.
[Str81] and [CDY92]. A simple nonexistence example given in [FdR11] illustrates this point quite
effectively.

Positive results without any smallness assumptions have been established in some special cases.
Focusing only on the general existence results in the multidimensional case pertinent to our ﬁnd-
ings, let us mention just a few: [Tan03] deals with linear-quadratic systems, [CN15] builds a struc-
ture around the ability to change the probability measure in the Markovian case, and in [HT15], a
slightly less general, “diagonally”-quadratic case is treated, but without the Markovian assumption.
Our present work was motivated not only by the unresolved status of the basic existence and
uniqueness problems for quadratic systems of BSDE, but also by a number of applications such
systems have. Indeed, in addition to their innate mathematical interest, BSDE appear in numerous
applications, including stochastic representations for partial differential equations, optimal stochas-
tic control and stochastic games (see, e.g. [EKH03], [CHKP14], [ET15], and [KP16]). Moreover,
as has been shown in [KXŽ15], arguably the most important open problem in stochastic ﬁnancial
economics - namely, the so-called incomplete-market equilibrium problem - can be reduced to a
quadratic system of BSDE (which we solve in the present paper). Quadratic systems of BSDE also
appear in geometry, most prominently in the study of harmonic functions between manifolds and
the construction of martingales on curved spaces, (see, e.g., [Dar95], [Bla05] and [Bla06]).

1.2. Our contributions - the main result. We focus on a Markovian framework, where the ran-
domness in the generator and the terminal condition is supplied by a (forward) d-dimensional
non-degenerate diffusion X. Our terminal condition is of the form G = g(XT ) and the generator
f (t, Xt, Yt, Zt) grows at most quadratically in Z. We formulate and work with a novel structural
condition on f which requires the existence of what we term a Lyapunov function. Loosely speak-
ing, a Lyapunov function h has the property that h(Y ) is a “strict” submartingale, a-priori, for any
solution Y of (1.1) (actually, we consider a pair of functions, but we focus on only one of them in
this introduction). Under the quadratic-growth assumption, Lyapunov functions always exist in the
1-dimensional case and can be found in the class of exponential functions; this explains the success
of the exponential transform in the 1-dimensional setting. The multidimensional case appears to
be much more difﬁcult, but as we show, widely applicable sufﬁcient conditions can be given.

Our main result states that when a Lyapunov function exists and an additional a-priori local-
boundedness condition holds, the equation (1.1) admits a Markovian solution as soon as g belongs
to an appropriately-deﬁned local Hölder space, without any assumptions of the “smallness” type
on the terminal condition, the driver, or the time horizon. Moreover, under an additional mild
assumption, this solution turns out to be unique in a wide class of stochastic processes.

In contrast to the bulk of the literature on multidimensional BSDE, we rely on deep analytic
results for systems of PDEs and combine them with probabilistic techniques. More precisely, we
use powerful ideas ﬁrst introduced to study regularity theory for systems of parabolic PDEs, most

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

notably the so-called partial-regularity estimates and the hole-ﬁlling technique of [Wid71], ini-
tially developed for elliptic systems and later extended to parabolic systems of PDEs in [Str81].
We represent this analytic theory entirely in a probabilistic fashion. This not only reduces some
technical estimates in the analytic counterpart, but also allows us to treat systems which are not
necessarily of divergence form. Partial-regularity and hole-ﬁlling techniques can be seen as a re-
placement for order-based arguments involving, for instance, the maximum principle (comparison
principle) or the related notion of a viscosity solution; such methods, unfortunately, fail miserably
in the multidimensional case (see [HP06]).

A major difﬁculty in adopting the techniques from the theory of systems of PDE lies in the choice
of the regularity class of the Markov representatives, i.e., functions v such that Yt = v(t, Xt) is a
solution. On one hand, the classical notion of a weak solution - typically a starting point for any
regularity analysis in the PDE world - is too weak for us; indeed, the very deﬁnition of a solu-
tion to a BSDE requires Y to be a semimartingale (see, however, [BL97], [BM01], [Lej02], and
[MX08] for developments in Lipschitz systems). On the opposite end of the spectrum, a classical
C 1,2-solution would, indeed, guarantee the semimartingale property of v(t, Xt), but one can hardly
expect that kind of regularity from a solution to a nonlinear system. In the one-dimensional case,
the situation is fully understood - Markov representatives of solutions to Markovian BSDE in di-
mension 1 are viscosity solutions to the associated quasilinear PDEs (see [PP92], [Kob00], [BH08]
or [DHB11]). The multidimensional case, again, presents major difﬁculties: unless the system is
very weakly coupled (only in its zero-th order terms), there is no natural notion of a viscosity so-
lution and there is no corresponding characterization of the class of semimartingale functions (see,
however, [CM97] for a related result in the Brownian case). However, in many applications, the
automatic semimartingale property is especially useful, as it allows us to perform so-called “veriﬁ-
cation” directly and without additional assumptions or the invocation of the dynamic-programming
principle.

The way we overcame these difﬁculties in the present paper is by: 1) approximating our system
by a sequence of well-behaved systems, 2) combining analytic methods described above with
probabilistic ones to obtain adequate uniform estimates on these approximations, and 3) showing
that the passage to the limit preserves the semimartingale property (as well as the equation itself),
while relying mostly on probabilistic arguments. This way, we obtain a solution of the form Yt =
v(t, Xt), Zt = w(t, Xt), where v is locally Hölder continuous, v(t, Xt) is a semimartingale,
and w is the weak Jacobian of v. While we are still far from a complete understanding of the
appropriate class of functions to replace viscosity solutions in the multidimensional case, we feel
that the functions with above properties constitute a promising ﬁrst step.

1.3. Our results - sufﬁcient conditions and examples. As a complement to our main existence/uniqueness
theorem, we provide a a sufﬁcient condition for the existence of Lyapunov functions - termed the
Bensoussan-Frehse (BF) condition - as well as a somewhat simpler sufﬁcient condition for a-priori
boundedness. The names of Bensoussan and Frehse are associated to this condition due to a set
of assumptions these authors place on the Hamiltonian of a particular system of parabolic PDE in
[BF02a]. A generalized version of these assumptions became our condition (BF) - a list of alge-
braic conditions on various terms in the generator. While one of them allows for any function of

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

4

sub-quadratic growth, all the others deal with quadratic expressions with a speciﬁc structure (we
even allow for a small “error” around the condition (BF), thus incorporating both “smallness” and
structural requirements into a single condition.) To the best of our knowledge, generators in all
solvable Markovian BSDE systems described in the literature so far satisfy our condition (BF).

We illustrate our main results and the sufﬁcient conditions with a number of examples. Our
ﬁrst example shows that the stochastic equilibria exist and are unique in a class of incomplete
ﬁnancial market models, with heterogeneous “exponential” agents. Next, we construct a class of
martingales on differential manifolds with connections under fewer assumptions than before. Then,
we treat two non-zero sum stochastic games, namely, a game with “cooperation and hindrance”,
and a risk-sensitive stochastic differential game; we show that Nash equilibria exist in both. Our
ﬁnal example focuses on a different aspect of our results and treats a one-dimensional equation.

1.4. Structure of the paper. After this introduction, we describe the setting and state our main
theorem and various sufﬁcient conditions for its assumptions in section 2. Section 3 contains exam-
ples, while the proofs are divided between two sections: section 4 deals with Hölder boundedness
and contains the bulk of the partial-regularity and hole-ﬁlling estimates, while all the other proofs
are collected in section 5.

ent, interpreted as a row vector, while D2u denotes its (spatial) Hessian matrix. Individual spatial

We will also have occasion to evaluate bilinear forms on function gradients; for a d× d matrix S
we write hDu, DwiS = Pij DiuDjwSij = DuSDw⊤. More generally, for a square matrix S and
two matrices A and B of appropriate dimensions, we write hA, BiS for the matrix ASB⊤. The
Frobenious product of matrices is denoted by A : B, i.e., for square matrices A and B of the same
dimension, we deﬁne A : B = Pij AijBij = Tr(A⊤B). The Frobenius norm of a square matrix A
is given by √A : A.
The notation |·| is used both for the Lebesgue measure of a subset of Rd, as well as for the
Euclidean norm in any Euclidean space; it should be interpreted as the Frobenius norm, in case
its argument is a matrix. For (t, x) ∈ R × Rd, we use an anisotropic norm, namely, we set
|(t, x)| = max(q|t|,|x|). The ball of radius R around x in Rd is denoted by BR(x). In the special
case when x = 0 and R = n ∈ N, we use simply Bn.
The notation || · || will be reserved for inﬁnite-dimensional spaces. More speciﬁcally, unless
deﬁned otherwise, || · || stands for the L2-norm, both on the underlying probability space, and on
an appropriate domain.

2.1. The setup, standing assumptions and key concepts.
2.1.1. The driving diffusion. We work on a probability space (Ω,FT , P), on which a d-dimensional
Brownian motion (Wt)t∈[0,T ] is deﬁned. With F = (Ft) denoting the argumented ﬁltration gener-
ated by W , we consider the stochastic differential equation

dXt = b(t, Xt)dt + σ(t, Xt)dWt,

(2.1)

where

(1) the drift vector b : [0, T ] × Rd → Rd is uniformly bounded,
(2) the dispersion matrix σ : [0, T ]× Rd → Rd×d is symmetric and there exist a constant Λ > 0
(3) there exists a constant L such that, for all t ∈ [0, T ], x, x′ ∈ Rd, we have

Λ |z|2, for all (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd and all z ∈ Rd, and

such that Λ |z|2 ≥ |zσ(t, x)|2 ≥ 1

These conditions ensure, in particular, that for each (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd, there exists a unique
strong solution (X t,x
t = x. For notational reasons,
we extend X t,x by setting X t,x
u = x, for u ∈ [0, t), and denote by Pt,x its law on the canonical
space C d[0, T ].
2.1.2. Markovian and Hölderian Solutions. Given a sequence {αn} in (0, 1], a sequence {vm} is
said to be bounded in C {αn}
([0, T ] × Rd) if there exists a sequence {cn} of positive constants,
such that, for all m, n ∈ N,

ious spaces of continuously (non-fractionally) differentiable functions are deﬁned in the standard

A Markovian solution (v, w) to (2.2) is said to be bounded if v is bounded, continuous if v is
continuous, locally Hölderian if v ∈ C {αn}
, for some sequence {αn} in (0, 1], and a bmo-solution
if Z t,x ∈ bmo for all (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd.
Remark 2.2. For Markovian BSDE, it is customary to consider the generator ˜f (t, x, y, zσ) in-
stead of our f (t, x, y, z). Due to our assumptions on σ, these are equivalent and we maintain the
generator as f for notational convenience later on.

2.1.3. Lyapunov functions. The key condition in our main result below concerns the existence of
sequence of functions which we term the Lyapunov functions. We abbreviate a = σσ⊤, deﬁne
hz, zia(t,x) = zσ(t, x)(zσ(t, x))⊤, and remind the reader that Bn = {x ∈ Rd : |x| ≤ n}.
Deﬁnition 2.3 (Lyapunov functions). Let f : [0, T ]× Rd× RN × RN ×d → RN be a Borel function
and let c > 0 be a constant. A pair (h, k) of nonnegative functions, with h ∈ C 2(RN ) and k Borel,
is said to be a c-Lyapunuov pair for f if h(0) = 0, Dh(0) = 0, and

1

2D2h(y) : hz, zia(t,x) − Dh(y)f (t, x, y, z) ≥ |z|2 − k(t, x),

(2.3)

for all (t, x, y, z) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd × RN × RN ×d, with |y| ≤ c. We write (h, k) ∈ Ly(f , c).
Given a sequence {cn} of positive constants, a pair ({hn},{kn}) of sequences of nonnegative
functions, with hn ∈ C 2(RN ) and kn Borel, is called a local {cn}-Lyapunov pair for f , if hn(0) =
0, Dhn(0) = 0 and

1

2D2hn(y) : hz, zia(t,x) − Dhn(y)f (t, x, y, z) ≥ |z|2 − kn(t, x),

(2.4)
for all n ∈ N, (t, x, y, z) ∈ [0, T ] × Bn × RN × RN ×d, with |y| ≤ cn. We write ({hn},{kn}) ∈
Lyloc(f ,{cn}).
Remark 2.4.

(1) Suppose that the process Y has a semimartingale decomposition as in (2.2) (i.e., solves
the BSDE system) and satisﬁes the bound |Y | ≤ c. A function h for which (2.3) holds
has the property that h(Yt) is a semimartingale with the ﬁnite variation part dominating
(in the increasing order) the process ´ ·
0(cid:16)|Zu|2 − k(u, Xu)(cid:17) du. The function k will often

be constant, but certain applications require more ﬂexibility. If one wants to deal with

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

7

unbounded Y , a layer of localization - expressed through the dependence on n and the
sequence {cn} in the local version - is necessary.
(2) It is interesting to note that in the scalar case (N = 1), and when the generator f grows at
most quadratically in z, it is essentially sufﬁcient to look for Lyapunov pairs with h(y) =
exp(αy), for large enough α. As we shall see below, this no longer works in the vector
case, which leads to nontrivial constructions of Lyapunov pairs under speciﬁc structural
conditions.

2.2. A uniform estimate. The ﬁrst main result of the paper, contained in Theorem 2.5 below,
provides an abstract stencil for a uniform estimate for a family of BSDE systems under several
assumptions, most notable of which is the existence of a Lyapunov pair, uniform for all systems in
the family. Sufﬁcient conditions for these assumptions and examples will be given shortly.
Theorem 2.5 (Uniform estimate). Let {f m} and {gm} be sequences of Borel functions f m :
[0, T ] × Rd × RN × RN ×d → RN and gm : Rd → RN such that, for each m ∈ N, the BSDE
system

dYt = −f m(t, Xt, Yt, Zt) dt + Ztσ(t, Xt) dWt, YT = gm(XT ),

admits a Markovian solution (vm, wm).

Remark 2.6.

(1) The sequence {hn} in condition (4) above is chosen uniformly for all {f m}. Therefore the

inequality (2.4) is satisﬁed for all f m and km
on the right-hand side of (2.4), since any positive constant δn before |z|2 can be normalized
to 1 after scaling hn and km
(2) Applying the uniform estimate in Theorem 2.5 to a constant sequence (i.e. all {f m} and
{gm} are the same for different m), we obtain an a priori estimate for a continuous Mar-
kovian solution of a single system: let (v, w) be a continuous Markovian solution to (2.7)
whose data f and g satisfy assumptions in Theorem 2.5, then v is locally Hölderian.

2.3. Existence, uniqueness, and bmo-regularity. A direct consequence of the uniform estimate
in Theorem 2.5 is the existence of a Markovian solution to the system (2.7), whose data (f , g) are
approximated by a sequence {f m, gm}.
Theorem 2.7. (Existence by approximation) Let f :
[0, T ] × Rd × RN × RN ×d → RN and
g : Rd → R be a pair of Borel functions. Assume that there exist sequences {f m} and {gm}
which satisfy the assumptions of Theorem 2.5 and

lim
m→∞

f m(t, x, ym, zm) = f (t, x, y, z)

(2.6)
for all (t, x, y, z) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd × RN × RN ×d and all sequences ym → y and zm → z. Then the
system

gm(x) = g(x),

lim

and

dYt = −f (t, Xt, Yt, Zt) dt + Ztσ(t, Xt) dWt, YT = g(XT ),

(2.7)

admits a locally Hölderian solution (v, w) such that v is a locally uniform limit of a subsequence
of {vm} in Theorem 2.5, and w is the weak Jacobian of v on (0, T ) × Rd.

The solutions produced in Theorem 2.7 are not necessarily unique, even when the solutions to
the approximating equations are. Moreover, their local-martingale parts are not necessarily (true)

sequence of bounded and smooth approximations to the function g appearing in Tychonov’s non-
uniqueness theorem (see [Joh78, p. 171]) for the heat equation.

As we shall see below, these pathologies disappear under appropriate conditions on f and g. For
example, when there exist a Lyapunov pair (h, k) with bounded k, martingality (bmo-martingality,
in fact) is obtained for bounded solutions. When the generator does not depend on y and satisﬁes
additional regularity assumption in z, uniqueness is also recovered. Two Markovian solutions,
(v, w) and (v′, w′), are considered equal if v(t, x) = v′(t, x) for all (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd and
w = w′, a.e., with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [0, T ] × Rd.
Theorem 2.8 (Uniqueness and bmo-regularity). Given a constant c > 0, suppose that there exists
a (global) Lyapunov pair (h, k) ∈ Ly(f , c) with k bounded. Furthermore, suppose that there exist
a sequence {αn} in (0, 1] and a constant M > 0 such that

g ∈ C {αn}

for all (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd, |y| ≤ c, and z ∈ RN ×d. Then

(1) each continuous solution (v, w) of (2.2) with ||v||L∞ ≤ c is a bmo-solution, and
(2) if, additionally, f is continuous, does not depend on y, and there exists ˜M ≥ 0 such that

|f (t, x, z) − f (t, x, z′)| ≤ ˜M (|z| + |z′|) |z − z′| ,

for all t, x, z, z′,

then (2.2) admits at most one continuous solution (v, w) with ||v||L∞ ≤ c.

2.4. A sufﬁcient condition for existence and uniqueness. As we will see in Section 3, the gener-
ator f is independent of y in many applications. In this case, the following result provides explicit
conditions on the generator f and the terminal condition g such that assumptions in Theorems 2.5,
2.7, and 2.8 hold for the following system

While the proof depends on the abstract Theorem 2.5 above, we state it in a self-contained form to
make it more accessible to a reader interested in its applications.

We start with a structural condition on the generator f . To the best of our knowledge, a version
of it was ﬁrst formulated in [BF02b]. We present here a generalization including a subquadratic
term; a further generalization will be discussed in Remark 2.14 below. We interpret z ∈ RN ×d as
an N × d-matrix, and use zj to denote its j-th row, j = 1, . . . , N. In the vector case the superscript
j denotes the j-th component.

f (t, x, z) = diag(z l(t, x, z)) + q(t, x, z) + s(t, x, z) + k(t, x),

Deﬁnition 2.9 (The Bensoussan-Frehse (BF) condition). We say that a continuous function f :
[0, T ] × Rd × RN ×d → RN satisﬁes the condition (BF) if it admits a decomposition of the form
(2.9)
such that the functions l : [0, T ] × Rd × RN ×d → Rd×N and q, s, k : [0, T ] × Rd × RN ×d → RN
have following property:
there exist two sequences {Cn} and {qn} of positive constants with
qn > 1+d/2, and a sequence {κn} of functions κn : [0,∞) → [0,∞) with limw→∞ κn(w)/w2 = 0
such that, for each n ∈ N and all (t, x, z) ∈ [0, T ] × Bn × RN ×d we have

In that case, we write f ∈ BF({Cn},{κn},{qn})

The (BF) conditions are simple enough to be easily checked in applications, but also strong
enough to yield the following result which will play a major role in the existence theorem below:
Proposition 2.10 (Existence of Lyapunov pairs under condition (BF)). Let {cn} is an arbitrary
sequence of positive constants, and f a function in BF({Cn},{κn},{qn}).
(1) There exists a local {cn}-Lyapunov pair ({hn},{kn}) for f . Furthermore, the same pair
(2) If, additionally, the sequences {Cn}, {qn} and {κn} are constant (in n), then, for each c, a

({hn},{kn}) is a local {cn}-Lyapunov pair for any other function f ′ ∈ BF({Cn},{κn},{qn}).
(global) c-Lyapunov pair for f exists.

Another ingredient necessary to guarantee the existence of a solution to (2.8) is a-priori bound-
edness. We remind the reader that a set of non-zero vectors a1, . . . , aK in RN (with K > N) is
said to positively span RN, if, for each a ∈ RN there exist nonnegative constants λ1, . . . , λK such
that

λ1a1 + · · · + λKaK = a.

The following two well-known characterization (see [Dav54]), presented here for reader’s conve-
nience, make positively-spanning sets easy to spot: (1) Non-zero vectors a1, . . . , aK positively
(2)
span RN if for every a ∈ RN \ {0} there exists k ∈ {1, . . . , K} such that a⊤ak > 0.
If non-zero vectors a1, . . . , aK already span RN, then they positively span RN if 0 admits a
nontrivial positive representation, i.e., if there exist nonnegative λ1, . . . , λK, not all 0, such that
λ1a1 + · · · + λK aK = 0.

Deﬁnition 2.11 (The a-priori boundedness (AB) condition). We say that f satisﬁes the condition
(AB) if there exist a deterministic function l ∈ L1[0, T ], and a set a1, . . . , aK which positively
spans RN, such that

a⊤
k f (t, x, z) ≤ l(t) + 1

for all (t, x, z) and k = 1, . . . , K.

k zLk(t, x, z),

We say that f satisﬁes the weak condition (AB) - abbreviated as (wAB) - if there exist Borel
functions Lk : [0, T ] × Rd × RN ×d → Rd, for k = 1, . . . , K, such that |Lk(t, x, z)| ≤ C(1 + |z|)
for some constant C and

k f (t, x, z) ≤ l(t) + 1

2|a⊤
k z|2 + a⊤
2 in (2.10) is simply a convenient choice for later use; it can easily be
Remark 2.12. The constant 1
replaced by any other constant by scaling. Furthermore, conditions (AB) and (wAB) are invariant
under invertible linear transformation of RN. More precisely, suppose that f satisﬁes (wAB) with
l ∈ L1[0, T ], the positively-spanning set a1, . . . , aK and the functions {Lk}, and that Σ : RN →
RN is an invertible linear map. Then the generator of the transformed system, namely ˜f (t, x, ˜z) :=
Σf (t, x, z), satisﬁes (wAB) with the same l, ˜Lk(t, x, ˜z) = Lk(t, x, z), and transformed (but still
positively spanning) set (Σ−1)⊤ak, k = 1, . . . , K.

for all (t, x, z) and k = 1, . . . , K.

(2.11)

Theorem 2.13 (Existence and uniqueness under (BF)+(AB)). Suppose that f satisﬁes conditions
(BF) and (AB), and that g ∈ C {αn}
satisﬁes lim|x|→∞ |g(x)| / |x|2 = 0. Then the system (2.8)
admits a locally Hölderian solution (v, w). When g is bounded, the condition (AB) can be replaced
by (wAB) and (v, w) is a bounded bmo-solution.

loc

This solution (v, w) is unique in the class of bounded continuous solutions if the following,

additional, assumptions are met:

(a) the functions f (·,·, 0) and g are bounded,
(b) the constants {Cn} and functions {κn} in the (BF) condition do not depend on n, and
(c) there exists a constant M such that |f (t, x, z) − f (t, x, z′)| ≤ M(|z| + |z′|) |z − z′| for

all t ∈ [0, T ], x ∈ Rd, z, z′ ∈ RN ×d.

Remark 2.14. Here are two extensions of Theorem 2.13 which, for the sake of simplicity of presen-
tation, we did not put into its statement. They will be proved, however, along with Theorem 2.13,
below.

(1) When g is bounded, the conclusions of Theorem 2.13 hold if the equality in (2.9) holds
only approximately, namely if, for each n ∈ N, there exists a sufﬁciently small εn such that
f (t, x, z) − diag(zl(t, x, z)) − q(t, x, z) − s(t, x, z) − k(t, x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ εn |z|2
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(2.12)
holds on [0, T ]×Bn× RN ×d. How small this εn needs to be depends on the constants {Cn}
in the condition (BF), on ||v||L∞ (which, in turn, depends on ||g||L∞ and the functions and
constants appearing in condition (wAB)), as well as the universal constants (Λ, T, d, N,
etc.). In general, it is possible to obtain an explicit expression for an estimate of εn by
keeping track of the explicit values of the constants involved in the proof, but we do not
pursue that here. The case in which such an explicit expression may prove to be useful
is when l = 0, q = s = 0 and k = 0, i.e. when f is of general structure, but satisﬁes

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

a smallness assumption. This case allows for an especially simple treatment; indeed, to
construct a global Lyapunov pair, it sufﬁces to pick

h(y) = 1

2 |y|2 , k ≡ 0, so that D2h = Id and Dh(y) = y.

Then,
2 D2h : hz, zia = 1
Therefore, it sufﬁces to require ε < (4Λ||v||L∞)−1 so that (h, 0) ∈ Ly(f , 2kvkL∞). This
recovers the situation in [Str81] where solutions to parabolic systems of PDEs were con-
structed under a parallel “smallness” condition.

(2) Suppose that some component of g(XT ), say the j-th, has a bounded Malliavin derivative
and f j does not depend on zi for i 6= j. It is known then (see [BE13] and [CN14] for
sufﬁcient conditions on X, f j and gj) that the j-th component Z j of the solution is bounded,
too. In this case, Theorem 2.13 still holds if any locally bounded function of zj is added to
the right-hand side of (2.10) and (2.11).

3. EXAMPLES

We illustrate the strength of our results by considering four different classes of BSDE systems
arising from game theory, geometry, mathematical economics and mathematical ﬁnance. Proofs
of all statements are postponed until section 5.

3.1. Incomplete stochastic equilibria. The existence and properties of equilibrium (market-clearing)
asset-price dynamics in ﬁnancial markets is one of the central problems in ﬁnancial economics and
mathematical ﬁnance. While the so-called complete market case has been fully understood, the
incomplete market case has been open since early 1990s. A stochastic equilibrium among N het-
erogeneous agents in incomplete markets has been considered in [KXŽ15]. There the ﬁltration is
generated by a 2-dimensional Brownian motion W = (B, B⊥), where the ﬁrst component drives
the price of a tradable asset but both components can determine the size of agents’ random endow-
ment. Preference of agents are modeled by exponential utilities with heterogenous risk-tolerance
coefﬁcients. An equilibrium is a pair consisting of an asset-price process and agents’ trading strate-
gies such that every agent maximizes the expected utility from trading and random endowment,
meanwhile supply equals to demand (market clears), cf. [KXŽ15, Deﬁnition 1.1].

In this setting, [KXŽ15] considered the following system of quadratic BSDE:

t − 1

t +(cid:16) 1
2 ν2

dYt = µtdBt + νtdB⊥

2 A[µt]2 + A[µt]µt(cid:17) dt, YT = G,
i=1 αiµi for a sequence of constants (αi) with αi ∈ (0, 1) and PN

where A[µ] = PN
i=1 αi = 1.
It is proved in [KXŽ15, Theorem 1.6] that equilibria one-to-one correspond to solutions of (3.1)
with (µ, ν) ∈ bmo. Moreover in an equilibrium, each component of Y represents the certainty
equivalence of each agent. However, when it comes to the existence and uniqueness of solutions,
certain “smallness-type" of conditions need to be assumed; either ||G||L∞ is sufﬁciently small or
T is sufﬁciently small, cf. [KXŽ15, Corollaries 2.6 and 2.7]. In the Markovian setting, existence
of solutions was also established for sufﬁciently small T in [Žit12] in a similar model, and [Zha12]
and [CL15, Theorem 3.1].

The following result establishes global existence and uniqueness of equilibrium in a Markovian
setting with bounded random endowment. Here, X is the solution of (2.1) with W = (B, B⊥),
b : [0, T ] × Rd → Rd, and σ : [0, T ] × Rd → Rd×2 satisfying conditions (1)-(3) after (2.1).
Theorem 3.1 (Existence and uniqueness of incomplete stochastic equilibria). Suppose that the
terminal condition is of the form G = g(XT ) for some g ∈ C {αn}
loc ∩ L∞. Then the system (3.1)
admits a unique bounded continuous solution. Consequently, an incomplete stochastic equilibrium
in the setting of [KXŽ15] exists and is unique in the class of equilibria in which each agent’s
certainty-equivalence process is a continuous function of time and the state X.

Remark 3.2. When g is of merely subquadratic growth, the system (3.1) still admits a locally Hölde-
rian solution, but the martingale part associated to this solution may not have enough integrability
to be identiﬁed with an equilibrium.
3.2. Martingales on manifolds. It is well-known that semimartingales can be deﬁned on arbi-
trary differentiable manifolds, but that martingales require additional structure, namely that of a
connection (if one wants a Brownian motion, one needs a full Riemannian metric). We refer the
reader to the books [Éme89] and [Hsu02] for more details.

In the ﬂat (Euclidean) case, martingales are easily constructed from their terminal values by a
simple process of ﬁltering, i.e., computing conditional expectation. When the underlying ﬁltration
is Brownian, one can, additionally, build this martingale from the given Brownian motion via the
martingale representation theorem; this amounts to a solution to a linear system of BSDE.

If the geometry is not ﬂat, one cannot simply ﬁlter anymore, but, as it turns out, the problem can
still be formulated in terms of a system of BSDE. This system, however, is no longer linear and
the existence of its solution has been a subject of extensive study (see, e.g., [Dar95], [Bla05] and
[Bla06]).

Before we write down this system, we set the stage by assuming that a d-dimensional Brown-
ian motion W is given, and that the target space is an N-dimensional differentiable manifold M,
without boundary, endowed with an afﬁne connection. This connection, Γ, is described in coordi-
nates by its Christoffel symbols Γk
ij; we assume these are all Lipschitz on compact sets, but not
necessarily differentiable (as we will not be needing the concept of curvature).

The martingale property on a manifold with a connection Γ can be formulated in many ways -
we prefer to give the one that resembles a characterization in the ﬂat case; we say that a continuous
M-valued semimartingale Y is a Γ-martingale (with respect to the natural ﬁltration of W ) if

f (Yt) − 1

2 ˆ t

0

Hess f (dYt, dYt), t ∈ [0, T ],

is a local martingale for each smooth real-valued f. Here Hess f is the (covariant) Hessian of f,
i.e., a (0, 2)-tensor, given in our coordinate chart by

(Hess f )ij(y) = Dijf (y) − Γk

ij(y)Dkf (y).

We refer the reader to [Éme89, p. 23] for the deﬁnition of quadratic variation with respect to a
(0, 2)-tensor ﬁeld (such as Hess) on a manifold. Itô’s formula immediately implies that Y is a
Γ-martingale if its coordinate representation admits the following semimartingale decomposition

where, as usual, Z j denotes the j-th row of the N × d-matrix-valued process Z.
For simplicity, and without too great a loss of generality, we assume that the given terminal value
G of the martingale we want to construct is of the form g(WT ). Furthermore, we assume that the
image of g is localized in the following way: there exists a convex and compact set M0, covered
by the image V ⊆ M of a single chart, with coordinates y = (y1, . . . , yN ), such that g(x) ∈ M0,
for all x ∈ Rd. This way, we can work in a single coordinate chart, as if M itself were an open
set of RN and, in fact, assume that M = RN. Also since we only care about the connection in a
neighborhood of M0, we assume that the Christoffel symbols are globally Lipschitz.

As in [Dar95], we make the following assumption on the geometry of M around the image of g:

Assumption 3.3 (Double convexity). There exists a convex function φ ∈ C 2(RN ) such that

(1) M0 = φ−1((−∞, 0]), and
(2) Hess φ is nonnegative deﬁnite (φ is geodesically convex), and strictly positive deﬁnite on
some neigborhood of M0.

Applying Theorem 2.7 to the current setting, we obtain the following result.

Proposition 3.4. If g ∈ C {αn}(Rd) and Assumption 3.3 holds, there exists a Γ-martingale {Yt}t∈[0,T ]
with YT = g(WT ) which takes values in M0, for all t ∈ [0, T ].
Remark 3.5.

(1) While the detailed proof of Proposition 3.4 above is postponed until Section 5, we com-
ment, brieﬂy, on the interpretation of Lyapunov pairs in this, special, case. What makes it
especially convenient is the fact that the driver f depends on Z only through the symmetric
matrix Z ⊤Z. A simple computation shows that (h, 0) is a c-Lyapunov pair if (and only if)
the matrix

(cid:16)D2
ijh(y) −Pk Dkh(y) Γk

ij(y)(cid:17)ij

, i, j = 1, . . . , d

is strictly positive deﬁnite for all |y| ≤ c. Equivalently, Hess h(y) (cid:23) 0, i.e., h is (geodesi-
cally) strictly convex (see, e.g., Chapter 3 of [Udr94] for a detailed discussion of convexity
on Riemannian manifolds). This characterization ﬁts perfectly with our interpretation of
Lyapunov functions as “submartingale” functions.

(2) Unlike in the ﬂat case, where convex functions abound, the very existence of (geodesically)
convex functions depends on geometric properties on M. We do not go into details, but note
that smooth nontrivial global convex functions always exist on complete, simple-connected
Riemanninan manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature (Cartan-Hadamard manifolds);
cf. [Ken90]. In the general case, one can always ﬁnd a convex function locally, but it is
not hard to see that compact Riemannian manifolds, e.g., never admit nonconstant global
convex functions. We refer the reader to [Udr94] for a thorough treatment of geodesic
convexity.

(3) The condition of double convexity has been imposed in [Dar95] to construct not-necessarily-
Markovian martingales with values in manifolds with connections. Our construction not
only recovers some of the results from [Dar95] in the Markovian case, but also gives a par-
tial positive answer to Conjecture 7.2., p. 1257. Indeed, Proposition 3.4 does not require

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

14

M0 to have doubly convex geometry, i.e., does not assume conditions 5.1 and 6.1 in [Dar95,
Theorem 7.1].

(4) Without too much work, Proposition 3.4 can be extended in several directions. First, the
ﬂat Brownian motion W can be replaced by a Brownian motion on a Riemannian manifold
(with metric g); indeed, one simply needs to solve a modiﬁed version of BSDE 3.2 driven
by a driftless diffusion whose dispersion coefﬁcient σ relates to the underlying metric as
σσ⊤ = g−1. Moreover, under appropriate growth conditions, the linear connection Γ can
be replaced by a nonlinear one, of the form Γ = Γ(y, Z ⊤Z).

(5) Seen as a map between manifolds, a function which transforms a Browninan motion into
a martingale is called harmonic. Our BSDE (3.2) corresponds to the parabolic system
introduced by [ES64] in order to show that, under certain geometric conditions, harmonic
maps exist within each homotopy class (see [Aub98, Chapter 10] for a detailed treatment
of this fascinating problem).

3.3. A Stochastic Game with Cooperation or Hinderance. Our next example concerns a ﬁnite-
horizon stochastic differential game which is inspired by a bounded-domain discounted game
treated in [BF00]. For simplicity of presentation, we assume there are only 2 players whom we call
Player 1 and Player 2. On a d-dimensional Brownian ﬁltration, these players choose two Rd-valued
processes, namely µ and ν in bmo, as their respective controls. These affect the state X through
its drift in the following way:

dX (µ,ν)

t

= (cid:16)b(X (µ,ν)

t

) + µt + νt(cid:17)dt + dW (µ,ν)

t

where b : Rd → Rd is a bounded Lipschitz vector ﬁeld, and W (µ,ν) = W − ´ ·
0(µu + νu)du
is a Brownian motion under the probability measure P(µ,ν) deﬁned via d P(µ,ν)/d P = (´ (µu +
νu)⊤dWu)T . Given a constant θ - which we term the cooperation penalty - and integrable-enough
functions hi, gi : Rd → R, i = 1, 2, the cost of player i with the initial state x at time t = 0 is
deﬁned as

J i(0, x, µ, ν) = E(x,µ,ν)(cid:20)ˆ T

0 (cid:16)hi(Xu) + 1

2|µu|2 + θµ⊤

u νu(cid:17)dt + gi(XT )(cid:21),

i = 1, 2,

where the expectation is taken with respect to P(x,µ,ν). It is clear from its form how large positive
values of the parameter θ incentivize the players to push in opposing directions, while the large
negative values motivate them to cooperate. A Nash equilibrium between these two players is a
pair ( ˆµ, ˆν) of controls with the property that, for any µ, ν ∈ bmo, we have

J 1(0, x, ˆµ, ˆν) ≤ J 1(0, x, µ, ˆν)

and J 2(0, x, ˆµ, ˆν) ≤ J 2(0, x, ˆµ, ν),

(3.3)

and (J 1, J 2)(·,·, ˆµ, ˆν) is called the value of this equilibrium.

We recast the problem as a BSDE system by introducing the Lagrangians of the two players:
2|ν|2 + θµ · ν + p2(µ + ν),

L1(µ, ν, p) = 1
where pi is i-th row vector of p. When θ 6= ±1, the minimizers are given by

2|µ|2 + θµ · ν + p1(µ + ν)

and L2(µ, ν, p) = 1

ˆµ(p) =

θ

(1+θ)(1−θ) (p1 + p2) − 1

1−θ p1

and

ˆν(p) =

(1+θ)(1−θ) (p1 + p2) − 1

1−θ p2.

(3.5)

Setting Li(p) = Li( ˆµ(p), ˆν(p), p) and L = (L1, L2)⊤, we pose the following BSDE:
dYt = −f (Xt, Zt)dt + ZtdWt, YT = g(XT ), where f (x, z) = h(x) + L(z),

with the state process given by dXt = b(Xt)dt + dWt on the (augmented) ﬁltration generated by
W . The following result establishes a unique bounded Hölderian solution, which corresponds to a
Nash equilibrium.
Proposition 3.6. Assume that h ∈ L∞ and g ∈ C {αn}
loc ∩ L∞. When −1 6= θ ≤ 1/2 or θ >
1, the equation (3.5) admits a unique bounded continuous solution (v, w). Moreover the pair
( ˆµ(Z), ˆν(Z)), where Z = w(·, X), is in bmo and enacts a Nash equilibrium with the value v.
3.4. Risk-sensitive nonzero-sum stochastic games. Next, we consider a risk-sensitive stochastic
game between 2 players studied in [EKH03]. Let U and V be two compact metric spaces. Player
1 (resp. player 2) chooses a U-valued (resp. V -valued) control process µ (resp. ν), which affects
the state X in the following way:

dX (µ,ν)

t

= b(t, X (µ,ν)

t

, µt, νt) dt + σ(t, X µ,ν

where b : [0, T ] × Rd × U × V → Rd is a bounded measurable vector ﬁeld, σ satisﬁes conditions
(2) and (3) after (2.1), and X is understood as the unique weak solution of the previous stochastic
differential equation. Given measurable functions hi : [0, T ]× Rd × U × V → R and gi : Rd → R
with enough integrability, the cost of player i with the initial state x at time t = 0 is deﬁned as

J i(0, x, µ, ν) = E(x,µ,ν)(cid:20) exp(cid:18)ˆ T

0

hi(u, Xu, µu, νu) du + gi(XT )(cid:19)(cid:21),

i = 1, 2.

The problem is to ﬁnd a Nash equilibrium ( ˆµ, ˆν) satisfying (3.3). To solve it, we deﬁne the
Hamiltonian function

H 1(t, x, µ, ν) = µσ−1(t, x)b(t, x, µ, ν) + h1(t, x, µ, ν)
H 2(t, x, µ, ν) = νσ−1(t, x)b(t, x, µ, ν) + h2(t, x, µ, ν),

and

and assume the generalized Issac’s condition holds, i.e., there exists two measurable functions
ˆµ(t, x, z) and ˆν(t, x, z) such that

H 1(t, x, z1, ˆµ(t, x, z), ˆν(t, x, z)) ≤ H 1(t, x, z1, µ, ˆν(t, x, z))
H 2(t, x, z2, ˆµ(t, x, z), ˆν(t, x, z)) ≤ H 2(t, x, z2, ˆµ(t, x, z), ν),

and

for any (t, x, z, µ, ν) ∈ [0, T ]×Rd×R2×d×U×V . Denote ˆH 1(t, x, z) = H 1(t, x, z1, ˆµ(t, x, z), ˆν(t, x, z))
and ˆH 2(t, x, z) = H 2(t, x, z2, ˆµ(t, x, z), ˆν(t, x, z)). We consider the following system of BSDE:

dY i

t = −(cid:16) ˆH i(t, Xt, Zt) + 1
2|Z i
Proposition 3.7. Assume that gi ∈ C {αn}
loc ∩ L∞, hi ∈ L∞, and ˆH i is continuous, for i = 1, 2.
Moreover b has at most linear growth in (µ, ν), and ( ˆµ, ˆν) has at most linear growth in z, both
uniformly in (t, x). Then (3.6) admits a unique bounded continuous solution (v, w). Moreover
( ˆµ(·,·, w), ˆν(·,·, w)) is a Nash equilibrium with value (exp(v1), exp(v2)).

Remark 3.8. A solution to (3.6) was constructed in [EKH03, Theorem 5.3] in the case of a bounded
b and a bounded (but not necessarily continuous) terminal condition g. When g is locally Hölder,
our result shows that the solution is also locally Hölder (cf. Remark 2.6 part (2)). Moreover
when g is of merely subquadratic and b is bounded, our result still ensures the existence of locally
Hölderian solution to (3.6).

The system (3.6) belongs to the diagonally quadratic class studied recently in [HT15], whose
Theorem 2.7 implies the existence of a unique bounded solution of (3.6) with non-Markovian
bounded terminal condition.
3.5. A scalar example with unbounded coefﬁcients. Given continuous functions f, g : Rd → R,
with g ∈ C {αn}

loc ∩ L∞, but f possibly unbounded, we consider the BSDE
YT = g(XT ).

(3.7)

dYt = − 1

2f (Xt)|Zt|2dt + Zt dWt,

An equation of this type played a central role in a recent solution [CD15] of a long-standing open
problem of [Sub91]. Since the “coefﬁcient” f in front of the quadratic nonlinearity is unbounded,
the generator of (3.7) does not satisfy the standard quadratic growth bound in z (as presented, e.g.,
in [Kob00]).

Our Theorem 2.7 implies that (3.7) admits a bounded locally Hölderian solution. Indeed, con-
sider a sequence {f m} of bounded Lipschitz approximations of f such that limm→∞ f m(x) = f (x)

Standard Lipshitz theory implies that (3.8) admits a unique bounded continuous solution (vm, wm).
Moreover, the generator of (3.8) satisﬁes the condition (BF) of Deﬁnition 2.9 with lm = sm =
km = 0; the component qm satisﬁes the quadratic-triangular growth condition on each Bn uni-
formly in m. By Proposition 2.10 above, f admits a local {cn}-Lyapunov sequence, for each {cn}.
To establish a-priori boundedness, we rewrite (3.8) as
t |2∧m
|Zm|2 (Z m

2 f m(Xt) |Zm

Y m
T = g(XT ).

t = Z m

dY m

Since f m and g are bounded, a simple measure-change argument implies that kvmkL∞ ≤ kgkL∞.
Therefore it is enough to pick a local (||g||L∞)-Lyapunov pair to establish the existence of a
bounded locally Hölderian solution by Theorem 2.7. It is worth noting that our uniqueness re-
sults do not apply in this case. In fact, as far as we know, no general-purpose uniqueness result is
known for BSDE of this type.

Remark 3.9. The techniques of the present paper, geared towards systems of equations, have lim-
ited impact in the one-dimensional case where powerful methods based on comparison principle
apply. To illustrate that point, we note that the existence of a Markovian solution for (3.7) can
also be established using a localization technique of [BH06] or from a forward point of view, as in
[BEK13], as follows. With f m,p(x) = (−p) ∨ f (x) ∧ m for m, p ∈ N, the approximating BSDE

4. PROOF OF THEOREM 2.5

Within this proof, all the constants Λ, T, d, N, etc., and functions {hn}, {km

n } which deﬁne the
setting or appear in the assumptions of Theorem 2.5 will be thought of as global variables; any
function of them will be treated as a constant, which we call an universal constant. For quantities
dependent on additional parameters, we write, e.g., C = C(ψ) to signal that, in addition to the
global variables mentioned above, C also depends on ψ. In Hardy’s manner, universal, constants
will always be denoted by the letter C which may change from line to line, and they are always
positive. To increase readability, we use the notation ≤C as follows
‘a ≤ C b′.

‘a ≤C b′

Furthermore, we ﬁx both m and n ∈ N, and removing them almost entirely from the notation
throughout this section. It is important to note, however, that our treatment of m and n will be
different. One one hand, since we are after uniform estimates on the entire sequence {vm}, we
do not allow any of our constants to depend on m. (We will see later that the dependence on
n } is through its L∞-norm which is assumed to be bounded uniformly in m.) On the other
{km
hand, all our analysis in this section will be restricted locally to the ball Bn. Therefore n is be
added, temporarily, to the list of universal constants and all the estimates below will depend on it
implicitly. Hence, for the time being, the conditions of Theorem 2.5 is localized to x ∈ Bn and
we simply assume, for the reminder of this section, that conditions of (1) - (4), with indices m
and n removed, are satisﬁed. In particular, we assume that there exists constants α, b, c, ℓ > 0 and
q > 1 + d/2 such that

stands for

||v||L∞([0,T ]×Bn) ≤ c

and ||g||Cα(Bn) ≤ b.

(4.1)

There exists a Lyapunov pair (h, k) ∈ Ly(f , 2c) on Bn such that

(4.2)
for all (t, x) ∈ [0, T ]× Bn and z ∈ RN ×d. The α, b, c, ℓ and q are also added to the list of universal
constants.

|f (t, x, y, z)| ≤ M(|z|2 + k(t, x)),

kkkLq([0,T ]×Bn) ≤ ℓ

and

4.1. A “testing” Lemma. As we already mentioned, for each initial condition, the SDE (2.1)
admits a unique strong solution X t,x = (X t,x
u )u∈[t,T ]. For notational convenience in several proofs
below, we allow X to start from negative time, i.e. t ≤ 0. Therefore we extend b and σ via

b(t, x) = b(0, x)

and

σ(t, x) = σ(0, x)

for t ≤ 0.

These extended coefﬁcients still satisfy conditions (1)-(3) after (2.1), ensuring the existence of he
unique strong solution, which is still denoted by X t,x = (X t,x
u )u∈[t,T ]. Its inﬁnitesimal generator is
given by

Parameterized by (t, x), the laws of these solutions constitute a Markov family (Pt,x)(t,x)∈(−∞,T ]×Rd
of probability measures on C([0, T ] → Rd). (Even through the canonical process may start from
negative time, we only focus on its trajectory on [0, T ].) In a minimal notational overload, we use
X for the coordinate map on C([0, T ] → Rd) and set throughout

Yu = v(u, Xu)

and Zu = w(u, Xu)

for u ∈ [t ∨ 0, T ].

(4.4)
A C 1,2-function ϕ : [0, T ] × Rd → [0, 1] is said to be testable if its support is contained in
[0, T ] × Bn and we have Γϕ < ∞, where

Proof. We overload the notation by writing ϕ for both the process ϕ(·, X) and the function ϕ;
similarly, having ﬁxed c ∈ RN with |c| ≤ c, we write hc both for the function h(· − c) and the
process h(Y − c). We deﬁne the product process F = ϕhc = ϕ(·, X)h(Y − c) and write down
the semimartingale decompositions (under any Pt,x)

for all y with |y| ≤ c.

(4.7)
The fact that (h, k) ∈ Ly(f , 2c) coupled with the boundedness of a and the fact that |Y − c| ≤ 2c,
imply that the right-hand side of (4.6) above is bounded from below by

4.2. First consequences of the regularity of transition densities. It follows from the conditions
imposed on σ and b (see [SV06, Theorem 3.2.1, p. 71]) that the Markov family (Pt,x) admits a
family of transition densities

p(t, x; t′, x′),

t′ ∈ [t, T ], x′ ∈ Rd.

Moreover, they satisfy the following fundamental estimate (known as the Aronson’s estimate):
there exist constants σ, σ > 0, as well as C, C > 0, depending only on the L∞- and ellipticity
bounds on b and σ, such that, for all 0 ≤ t < t′ ≤ T and all x, x′ ∈ Rd, we have

Remark 4.2. Under our assumptions (cf. conditions (1)-(3) after (2.1)), the upper bound in (4.8)
can be obtained by the parametrix method (see [Fri64, equation (6.12), p. 24]). The lower bound
was ﬁrst obtained in the paraboloid |x′ − x|2 ≤ const(t′ − t) by [IKO62, equation (4.75)], then
extended globally by a standard chaining argument. When b and σ are only measurable and L is
in the divergence form, (4.8) was obtained by [Aro67, Theorem 1].

The ﬁrst consequence of the estimates (4.8) is the following uniform boundedness result:

Lemma 4.3. There exists a universal constant C > 0 such that

Et,x"ˆ T

t (cid:16) |Zu|2 + k(u, Xu)(cid:17)1{Xu∈Bn} du# ≤ C,

for all t, x ∈ [0, T ] × Rd.
Proof. Let χ be a testable function, such that, for all t ∈ [0, T ], χ(t, x) = 1 for x ∈ Bn−1 and
n. According to Lemma 4.1 and the boundedness of v on [0, T ] × Bn, there
χ(t, x) = 0 for x ∈ Bc
exists a universal constant C = C(χ) such that, uniformly over (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd we have

The uniform bound of Lemma 4.3 helps provide the following fundamental relation between w

and v.

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

20

Lemma 4.4. w is the weak (spatial) Jacobian Dv of v on (0, T ) × Rd.
Proof. Given ǫ ∈ (0, T /2) and the testable function χ from the proof of Lemma 4.3, we deﬁne

ˆv(t, x) = v(t, x)χ(t, x)

for t, x ∈ [0, T ] × Rd,

and let the sequence {ˆv(l)} (with l ≥ 1/ǫ) of approximations to ˆv be given by

ˆv(l)(t, x) = lˆ t+1/l

t

Et,x[ˆv(u, Xu)] du

for t, x ∈ [0, T − ǫ] × Rd.

The functions (ˆv(l)) are uniformly bounded (by c, in fact), and, thanks to smoothness of the transi-
tion densities of X, each ˆv(l) is C 1,2-differentiable. Moreover, as one readily checks, we have

( d

dt + L)ˆv(l)(t, x) = l(cid:18)Et,x[ˆv(t + 1/l, Xt+1/l)] − ˆv(t, x)(cid:19).

Having ﬁxed a pair (t, x) ∈ [0, T − ǫ] × Rd, we apply Itô’s formula to ˆv(·, X t,x), use the bounded-
ness of v on [0, T ]× Bn in the second inequality below, and recall the second inequality in (4.2) in
the last inequality, to obtain

where the last inequality follows from Lemma 4.3; the constant C obtained above is also uniform
for all t, x ∈ [0, T − ǫ] × Rd.
For any ˜ǫ > 0, there exists δ = δ(˜ǫ, n) ∈ (0, 1) such that

Continuity of v implies that ˆv is also continuous, and, hence, uniformly continuous on compacts.

|ˆv(t, x) − ˆv(t′, x′)| ≤ ˜ǫ

if

|(t, x) − (t′, x′)| ≤ δ and |x| ≤ n + 1.

The difference above vanishes if |(t, x) − (t′, x′)| ≤ δ and |x| > n + 1, since, in that case, x, x′ /∈

last expression is less than 2˜ǫ, for sufﬁciently large l, uniformly for t, x ∈ [0, T − ǫ] × Rd. Since
the choice of ˜ǫ is arbitrary, the previous estimates implies the uniform convergence of {ˆv(l)} to ˆv
on [0, T − ǫ] × Rd.
Setting ˆY (l) = ˆv(l)(·, X 0,x) and ˆY = ˆv(·, X 0,x), we use the uniform convergence of {ˆv(l)} to
obtain ˆY (l) → ˆY , uniformly. Applying Itô’s formula to | ˆY − ˆY (l)|2 and using (4.9), we obtain

By the lower bound in (4.8), the density p(0, x;·,·) is bounded away from 0 on [ǫ, T − ǫ]× Bn and
σ is uniformly elliptic. Therefore, D ˆv(l) → χw + vDχ in L2([ǫ, T − ǫ]× Bn), as l → ∞. Coupled
with the fact that ˆv(l) → ˆv also in L2([ǫ, T − ǫ] × Bn), this implies that χw + vDχ is the weak
Jacobian of vχ. The statement follows by noting that for each compact K ⊆ Rd, χw + vDχ = w
and vχ = v on [0, T ] × K, for large enough n, and the choice of ǫ is arbitrary.
4.3. Uniform local estimates. We now choose and ﬁx R ∈ (0, 1/4] and a pair (t0, x0) ∈ [0, T ] ×
Bn−1. It is important to note that none of the constants in the sequence of lemmas in the next two
subsections depends on the choice of (t0, x0) and R.

(cid:3)

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

22

We will use the point (t0, x0) (or only x0) as the origin throughout the proof and dilate the

coordinate system around it with the change of variables (t, x) → (τ, ξ), given by

x = x0 + Rξ

and

t = t0 + R2τ.

Most balls, cylinders, etc. in the sequel will be centered around (t0, x0) (or x0) and their dimen-
sions (radius, etc) will have much nicer expressions in the (τ, ξ)-coordinates, so we introduce the
following notation:

β(ρ) = {x ∈ Rd : |x − x0| ≤ ρR}, and
γ(θ; ρ) = (cid:26)(t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd : t0 ≤ t ≤ t0 + θR2,|x − x0| ≤ ρR(cid:27),

for the ball β and the parabolic cylinder γ.

Typically, a function ˜ϕ : R × Rd → R will be deﬁned in (τ, ξ)-coordinates, and then its counter-

part

R (cid:17) ,
R2 , x−x0

ϕ(t, x) = ˜ϕ(cid:16) t−t0

(4.10)
restricted to [0, T ] × Rd, is used in computations. A similar notation will be used for functions of
x only or for subsets of [0, T ] × Rd or Rd (identiﬁed with their indicators). In the same spirit, we
set ˜T = (T − t0)/(R2).
Within this proof,´ denotes the integral over Rd, while˜ stands for the integral over [t0, T ]×Rd.
If the domain of integration is notationally further restricted, as e.g., in ˜D, the integral is taken
over ([t0, T ]× Rd)∩ D (or Rd∩ D in the spatial case). Similarly, in order to avoid repeated explicit
minimization with T , we assume that temporal variables cannot take values above T , so that, for
example, the interval [t0, t0 + 4R2] coincides with [t0, T ], when t0 + 4R2 > T . Meanwhile, as we
mentioned before, t in Pt,x is allowed to be negative.

We continue with some consequences of (4.8) which will be used in the sequel. Given the origin

(t0, x0) and the radius R ﬁxed above, we introduce the following shortcut
for ε ≥ 0,

pε(t, x) = p(t0 − εR2, x0; t, x),

(4.11)

for the transition density, and state several useful estimates where the functions ∆σ, δσ are given
by

(4.12)
and extended to ε = 0, ε = +∞ by continuity. We also deﬁne the positive (universal) constant ε0
by

∆σ(ε) = exp(− 1

δσ(ε) = ε−d/2∆σ(ε),

2σ2 ε−1)

and

ε0 = inf{ε > 0 : δσ(ε) = 1/2} ∧ min(1, (σ2d)−1).

(4.13)
Note that δσ(ǫ) is increasing on [0, (σ2d)−1] and decreasing on [(σ2d)−1,∞) with δσ(0) = 0.
Therefore the deﬁnition of ǫ0 implies δσ(ǫ) ≤ δσ(ǫ0) ≤ 1/2 for ǫ ∈ [0, ǫ0]. The role of ǫ0 will be
clear in Proposition 4.16 below.

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

Lemma 4.5. There exists a universal constant C > 0 such that, for all (t, x) ∈ γ(4, 4) and
ε ∈ (0, ε0/2], we have
pε(t, x) ≤C R−d
pε(t, x) ≥C R−d δσ/4(ε0/2 + ε)
pε(t, x) ≤C R−d δσ(ε0/2 + ε)

when (t, x) 6∈ γ(1/4; 1/2),
when t ≥ t0 + ε0R2/2,
when t < t0 + ε0R2/2 and x 6∈ β(1).

(4.16)
Proof. We set ¯τ = ε + (t − t0)/R2 > 0, ξ = (x − x0)/R and r = ¯τ / |ξ|2 ∈ (0,∞], and note
that the bounds in the density estimates (4.8) can be represented in two forms (with the outer one
holding only for ξ 6= 0):

2 ∆σ(r) = |ξ|−d δσ(r),

(4.17)

which will be used throughout the proof.

- Inequality (4.14): Both δσ and ∆σ are bounded by a constant C on [0,∞], so, by the right-hand

side of (4.17), we have

Rdpε(t, x) ≤C max(|ξ| ,√¯τ )−d,

which, in turn, implies (4.14) since max(|ξ| ,√¯τ ) ≥ 1/2 on γ(1/4; 1/2)c.
- Inequality (4.15): Under the conditions of (4.15), we have r ≥ ¯τ /16, and so, by monotonicity

of ∆σ and (4.17), we have

Rd pε(t, x) ≥C ¯τ −d/2∆σ(r) ≥C δσ(¯τ /16) ≥C δσ/4(¯τ ).

The function δσ/4 attains it maximum at 16(σ2d)−1, and is nondecreasing to the left of it and
nonincreasing and positive to the right. Since ε0/2 + ε ≤ ¯τ, in the case that ¯τ ≤ 16(σ2d)−1, we
have δσ/4(¯τ ) ≥ δσ/4(ε0/2 + ε). On the other hand, if ¯τ ∈ (16(σ2d)−1, 4 1

2], we have

δσ/4(ε0/2 + ε) ≤ δσ/4(16(σ2d)−1) ≤C δσ/4(4 1

2) ≤ δσ/4(¯τ ).

Both alternatives lead to (4.15).

- Inequality (4.16): The conditions of (4.16) translate into ¯τ ≤ ε0/2 + ε ≤ (σ2d)−1, as well as

r ≤ ¯τ (since |ξ| ≥ 1). The function δσ is nondecreasing on [0, (σ2d)−1], so the (4.17) implies

Rd pε(t, x) ≤C δσ(r) ≤ δσ(ε0/2 + ε).

(cid:3)

An operational form of Lemma 4.1, stated in Proposition 4.7 below, employs a particular testing
function ϕ, obtained via (4.10) from a function ˜ϕ : R × Rd → [0, 1] in the class C 1,2(R × Rd)
satisfying

˜ϕ(τ, ξ) = 1, when τ ≤ 1 and |ξ| ≤ 1, ˜ϕ(τ, ξ) = 0, when τ ≥ 4 or |ξ| ≥ 2,

and ˜ϕ(τ, ξ) ∈ (0, 1) otherwise. By making sure that the ˜ϕ decreases fast enough (quadratically,
for example) towards its 0-level set, one can also guarantee the boundedness of |D ˜ϕ|2 / ˜ϕ. For the
corresponding function ϕ, expressed in the original coordinates (as deﬁned in (4.10)), we easily
check that, relative to the set [t0, T ] × Rd,
{ϕ = 1} = γ(1; 1)

{ϕ = 0} = γ(4; 2)c,

and

and that the quantity Γϕ is independent of the choice of (t0, x0). Due to R ≤ 1/4, we have
|Dϕb| ≤C

R2|D ˜ϕb|. Therefore Γϕ satisﬁes

(4.18)
Finally, the support of ϕ(t,·) is a subset of Bn, this follows from x0 ∈ Bn−1, supp ˜ϕ(τ,·) = B2,
and R ≤ 1/4.

4.4. A weighted Poincaré inequality and Struwe’s lemma. Next we state a weighted Poincaré
inequality in Lemma 4.8 below. Let ˜D be a Lipschitz domain (nonempty open connected set) in Rd,
and let D be its translate/dilate as described around (4.10). Similarly, let ˜χ be a weight function,

i.e., such that ˜χ ∈ L∞( ˜D) and ´ ˜D ˜χ > 0, and let χ be its translated/dilated version. Given a
function u ∈ L1(D), we deﬁne its χ-average
¯uχ
D =

uχ.

1

The special case χ = 1 is denoted simply by ¯uD. For a vector-valued function u, the same notation
is used, but with averaging is applied component-wise. When the domain D is omitted, it is
assumed that D = Int supp χ.

In keeping with the notational philosophy of the proof, ˜D and ˜χ are thought of as prototypes,
and D and χ as the family of their homothetic copies, indexed by t0, x0, and R. As above, the

´D χ ˆD

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

25

main message behind our results below is that estimates can be made independently (or explicitly
dependently) of those indices. Here, || · || denotes the L2-norm on D and H 1(D) the Sobolev space
W 1,2 on D.

Lemma 4.8. Given ˜D and ˜χ as above, there exists a universal constant C = C( ˜D, ˜χ) such that
for all u ∈ H 1(D) we have

||u − ¯uχ

D||2 ≤C R2 ||Du||2,

Proof. For w ∈ L2( ˜D), by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have
| ˜D| ´ ˜D w´ ˜D ˜χ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

| ˜D| ´ ˜D ˜χ|| ≥ (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)´ ˜D w ˜χ − 1

| ˜D| ´ ˜D w|||| ˜χ − 1

||w − 1

If, additionally, w ∈ H 1( ˜D), then, combining the previous inequality and Poincaré’s inequality,
we have

w ˜χ

˜D − w ˜D(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
˜D)2 + 2||w − w ˜D||2 ≤ C||w − w ˜D||2 ≤ C||∇w||2,

≤ 2(w ˜D − w ˜χ

(cid:3)

(4.21)

with C depending only on ˜D and ˜χ. It remains to set w(ξ) = u(x0 + Rξ).

Next, let us pick a (weight function) ˜ψ : Rd → [0, 1] such that

˜ψ(ξ) = 0, for |ξ| ≤ 1

2 or |ξ| ≥ 4,

˜ψ(ξ) = 1, for 1 ≤ |ξ| ≤ 2,

and ˜ψ(ξ) ∈ (0, 1), otherwise, and consider its version ψ in the x-coordinates.
Lemma 4.9. When d ≥ 2, there exists a universal constant C = C( ˜ψ) such that, for any u ∈
loc(Rd) we have
H 1

ˆβ(2)\β(1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

u − uψ(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

≤C R2 ˆβ(4)\β(1/2) |Du|2 .

The same inequality holds when the domain of the left integral is replaced by β(2) and that of right
one is replaced by β(4), but d is allowed to be 1 in this case.
Proof. With ˜D such that D = β(4)\β(1/2), we observe that supp ψ ⊆ D and that β(2)\β(1) ⊆ D.
Therefore, applying Lemma 4.8, we have

≤C R2ˆD |Du|2 .
D(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

The proof is the same when β(2) \ β(1) is replaced by β(2) and D = β(4).
Remark 4.10. When d = 1, the set β(4)\ β(1/2) = [−4,− 1
2, 4] is not connected, and, in fact,
the statement of Lemma 4.9 does not hold. To see that, it is enough to consider u = 1 on [−4,− 1
2]
2]. Then ´β(4)\β(1/2) |Du|2 = 0, but 1 < uψ < 2 implies ´β(2)\β(1) |u − uψ|2 > 0.
and u = 2 on [4, 1
On the other hand, let us argue that we can assume, without loss of generality, that d ≥ 2 in
Theorem 2.5. Indeed, suppose that we have established Theorem 2.5 for d ≥ 2, but we are facing
a situation where d = 1. In this case, we simply embed our one-dimensional problem into a two-
dimensional one. More precisely, we deﬁne the new state process, perhaps on an enlarged proba-
bility space, as ˆX = (X, B), where B is a Brownian motion independent of W . The so-obtained
coefﬁcients ˆb = (b, 0) and ˆσ = diag(σ, 1) satisfy all the necessary assumptions. Furthermore, the

2 ]∪ [ 1

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

26

functions ˆvm(t, x, x′) = vm(t, x) and ˆwm(t, x, x′) = (wm(t, x), 0) is a Markovian solution to
the system (2.5) on the enlarged probability space. The similarly deﬁned ˆf m and ˆgm satisfy the
assumptions of Theorem 2.5. In particular, for the Lyapunov pair in condition (4), the inequality
(2.4) (with f and kn replaced by f m and km
n respectively) is satisﬁed for all ˆz = (z, 0) ∈ RN ×2.
Therefore Theorem 2.5 implies that {ˆvm} is uniformly locally Hölderian in its ﬁrst two variables.
As a result, Theorem 2.7 produces a locally Hölderian solution (ˆv, ˆw) on the extended space. It
remains to use locally uniform convergence and Lemma 4.4 to conclude that ˆv does not depend on
the additional coordinate x′ and that the second column of ˆw vanishes. Therefore Y = ˆv(·, X, 0)
and Z = ˆw1(·, X, 0) are adapted to the original ﬁltration and solves the original system.

We consider ˜ψ as a global variable for the remainder of the proof. Consequently, the dependence
of universal constants on it will be suppressed in sequel. The following Lemma generalizes an
important result of Struwe (see [Str81, Lemma 4., p. 134])

Proof. We ﬁx ε ∈ (0, 1], and, reminding the reader that pε = p(t0 − εR2, x0,·,·), set η = ψ/pε.
Itô’s formula and Lemma 4.4, applied to the product Ft = η(t, Xt)vi(t, Xt) (with X = X t0−εR2,x0)
yields

5. ADDITIONAL PROOFS

5.1. Proof of Theorem 2.7. Thanks to our notational convention at the beginning of Section 4,
the index m was suppressed in the statement of Corollary 4.17. The dependence on km
n is through
its Lq-norm on [0, T ] × Bn, which is assumed to be bounded uniformly in m. With the condi-
tions (1)-(4) of Theorem 2.5 holding uniformly in m, we have a universal constant C such that
[vm]α0;Bn ≤ C, for all m. Combining this uniform Hölder estimate and the uniform bound in con-
dition (2) of Theorem 2.5, we apply Arzelá-Ascoli theorem on [0, T ]×Bn to extract a subsequence
of {vm} which converges uniformly. A diagonal procedure then produces another subsequence -
still denoted by {vm}, as well as a continuous function v : [0, T ] × Rd → RN such that vm → v,
locally uniformly. Thanks to the preservation of Hölder continuity under uniform convergence, the
function v belongs to the local Hölder space C {α′

n}, for some sequence {α′

n} in (0, 1].

Having picked and ﬁxed n ∈ N and the initial condition (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd, we set X = X t,x

and deﬁne the exit time

as well as the following two sequences of processes

τn = inf{u ≥ t : Xu 6∈ Bn},

Y (m)

u = vm(u, X τn
u )

and Z (m)

u = wm(u, Xu)1{u<τn},

u ∈ [t, T ].

Z (m).
It is straightforward now to let n → ∞ and conclude that the pair (v, w) is a Markovian solution
to (2.7). To show that w = Dv in the weak sense, we simply note that the proof of Lemma 4.4
applies verbatim.

We say that w ∈ uBMOloc if limδց0 ||w||bmo(δ,K) = 0 for any K; this, stronger, notion of bmo-
regularity will play a role in the uniqueness proof below. We start with a well-known estimate
whose proof we include for the reader’s convenience:
Lemma 5.1. For all (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × Rd, t′ ∈ [t, T ], and α ∈ (0, 1] we have

(5.4)

Et,x[|Xt′ − x|α] ≤ C (t′ − t)α/2,

where C depends only on α, d, ||b||L∞ and ||σ||L∞.
Proof. Using the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality, we obtain

2(cid:21) ≤C (t′ − t)1/2.

The inequality (5.4) now follows from the fact that Et,x[|Xt′ − x|α] ≤ Et,x[|Xt′ − x|]α.
Proposition 5.2. Suppose that, for some c > 0, there exists (h, k) ∈ Ly(f , c) with k ∈ L∞.
Then w ∈ uBMOloc and w(·, X) ∈ bmo for any locally Hölderian solution (v, w) to (2.2) with
||v||L∞ ≤ c.
Proof. Given (h, k) ∈ Ly(f , c), we apply Itô’s formula to h(Yu), where Yu = v(u, Xu), between
t and t′. With the boundedness of v guaranteeing that the expectations of the local-martingale parts
vanish, we obtain

Et,x(cid:20)h(v(t′, Xt′)) − h(v(t, x))(cid:21) ≥ Et,x"ˆ t′

t

|w(u, Xu)|2 du# − M(t′ − t),

where M is an upper bound for k. Boundedness of h on the image of v implies immediately that
w(·, X) ∈ bmo.
To derive a uBMOloc-estimate, let L be the Lipschitz constant of the function h on Bc. Recall
from Remark 2.6 part (2) that the restriction of a continuous v to each compact subset of [0, T ]×Rd

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

is (uniformly) Hölder-continuous. Given n ∈ N, the Markov inequality coupled with Lemma 5.1
imply that

Et,x(cid:20)h(v(t′, Xt′)) − h(v(t, x))(cid:21) ≤ L Et,x[|v(t′, Xt′) − v(t, x)|]

≤C Et,x[|v(t′, Xt′) − v(t, x)| 1|Xt′ −x|≤n] + 2||v||L∞ Pt,x[|Xt′ − x| > n]

≤C Et,x[max(|Xt′ − x|αn , (t′ − t)αn/2)] + (t′ − t)1/2 ≤C (t′ − t)αn/2,

where the constants C and αn above can be chosen uniformly for any x in a compact subset of Rd.
The statement then follows from combining the two displayed estimates.
(cid:3)

The uniqueness part of the proof is based on a result [Fre14, Proposition 2.1] of Frei, which, in
turn extends [Tev08, Proposition 1] from BSDE whose generator does not depend on y and the
terminal condition is small in L∞-norm, to those whose terminal condition is small in the BMO-
norm (see, also, [KP16, Theorem A.1] for a similar result). We now work with f which does not
depend on y and derive a consequence of Proposition 5.2 above.
Corollary 5.3. Let F : [0, T ] × Rd → RN be continuous and bounded, and let g ∈ C {αn}
The linear system

loc ∩ L∞.
(5.5)
admits a solution (v, w), which is unique in the class of bounded solutions. Furthermore, this
solution is locally Hölderian and w ∈ uBMOloc.
Proof. Let {f m, gm} be a sequence of smooth approximations obtained by molliﬁcation of the
functions F and g, respectively. This sequence of approximation does not depend on (y, z) and
can be constructed so that ||f m||L∞ + ||gm||L∞ ≤ 1 + ||F||L∞ + ||g||L∞ for all m, with {gm}
bounded in C {αn}
Thanks to their boundedness and independence of z, these functions are easily seen to satisfy
the conditions of Theorem 2.5. In fact, they admit a common c-Lyapunov pair for any c - indeed, it
is enough to choose a quadratic h and large-enough constant k. Thanks to the Lipschitz continuity
of its coefﬁcients, the equation

dYt = −f m(t, Xt, Zt) dt + ZtσtdWt, YT = gm(XT ),

admits a continuous Markovian solution (vm, wm) for each m, with {vm} uniformly bounded.
Therefore, by Theorem 2.7, there exists a locally Hölderian solution to (5.5), i.e., a Markovian
solution (v, w) with v ∈ C {α′
It is straightforward to see that this solutions is unique in the class of all bounded solutions.
Moreover, thanks to the existence of a Lyapunov pair mentioned above, the conditions of Proposi-
tion 5.2 are satisﬁed, and, so, w ∈ uBMOloc.
(cid:3)

To complete the proof of Theorem 2.8, part (2), we pick that we pick two bounded-v continuous
solutions (v, w) and (v′, w′). By Remark 2.6 part (2), both of them are locally Hölderian - we can
assume, without loss of generality, that they both belong to some C {αn}
, with the same exponent
sequence {αn}. We deﬁne t0 ∈ [0, T ] by

loc

t0 = inf{t ∈ [0, T ] : v(u, x) = v′(u, x) for all x ∈ Rd, u ∈ [t, T ]}.

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

35

Let us assume - contrary to the conclusion of the theorem - that t0 > 0. When restricted to [0, t0],
both (v, w) and (v′, w′) are bounded Markovian solutions to (2.2) with the terminal condition
g = v(t0,·) = v′(t0,·). They differ, however, on each interval of the form [t0 − δ, t0], δ > 0.
Since f (·,·, 0) is bounded by assumption, we can apply Corollary 5.3 above with F = f (·,·, 0),
g = v(t0,·) to conclude that the pair (˜v, ˜w), which solves the auxiliary equation (5.5) on [0, t0],
has the property that

lim
tրt0

Et,x"ˆ t0

t

| ˜w(u, Xu)|2 du# = 0, for all x ∈ Rd.

(5.7)

At this point, everything is ready for the application of the aforementioned local uniqueness re-
sult of Frei, which we summarize for the reader’s convenience: it describes a class of stochastic
processes (let us call it C) such that the solutions to (2.2) are unique in C under the conditions of
Theorem 2.8, provided that ˜M Et,x[´ t0
| ˜w(u, Xu)|2du] is small enough. Among the members of
the class C, as it turns out, are those pairs (ˆv, ˆw) for which the quantity
˜M Et,x(cid:20)ˆ t0
| ˆw(u, Xu)σ(u, Xu)|2 du(cid:21)

t

t

is small enough.

Thanks to (5.7), Frei’s result applies when t ∈ [0, t0) is chosen close enough to t0. By making it
even closer, if necessary, we can use Proposition 5.2 to make sure that both of our solutions (v, w)
and (v′, w′) belong to the class C. Therefore, thanks to the fact that Xu has a full support under
Pt,x for u ∈ (t, t0], we conclude that v(u,·) = v′(u,·) for each u ∈ (t, t0] - a contradiction with
our deﬁnition of t0. To show that w = w′, a.e., we simply appeal to Lemma 4.4 above.

5.3. Proof of Theorem 2.13. Our proof of Theorem 2.13 proceeds in two steps. In the ﬁrst step,
we construct a sequence of Lipschitz approximations to the generator f and the terminal condition
g, making sure there is enough uniformity for the construction of a uniform Lyapunov pair. Next,
we observe that those approximation satisfy the condition (AB) or (wAB), producing a uniform,
a-priori bound in L∞. Lastly, we apply the approximation Theorem 2.5.

5.3.1. Lipschitz approximations. We start by outlining a Lipschitz-approximation procedure that
will be used in the sequel. We extend slightly the notation for the class of functions satisfying the
condition (BF) from Deﬁnition 2.9, by including a general, but small, quadratic term; its signiﬁ-
cance is explained in Remark 2.14 and the additional term corresponds to the ‘error’ in (2.12). If a
function f : [0, T ] × Rd × RN ×d → RN admits the following decomposition

f (t, x, z) = diag(zl(t, x, z)) + q(t, x, z) + s(t, x, z) + e(t, x, z) + k(t, x),

(5.8)

where l, q, s, k satisfy the conditions of Deﬁnition 2.9, and for each n ∈ N we have

|e(t, x, z)| ≤ ǫn(1 + |z|2), for some ǫn > 0 and all (t, x, z) ∈ [0, T ] × Bn × Rd,

then we say that f satisﬁes the approximate condition (BF), and write f ∈ BFe({Cn},{κn},{qn},{εn}).
As Proposition 5.4 below shows, a pleasant feature of the condition (BF) (and its approximate
version) is that it allows for approximation by more regular functions, in a uniform way. More
precisely, f can be approximated by a sequence of regular functions {f m}, such that, even though
the functions l, q, s, k and e in the decomposition of f m may depend on m, the constant sequences

with the C is chosen so that ´ η(x)dx = 1. We use the same notation η (and the same formula) for
For each m ∈ N, we set ηm(x) = mdη(mx) and ηm(t, x, z) = m1+d+N ×dη(mt)η(mx)η(mz),

and use the standard notation for molliﬁcation, namely,

(g ∗ η)(x) = ˆ g(x − ¯x)η(¯x) d¯x,

as well as for its η(t, x, z)-version. We refer the reader to [Eva98, Appendix C.4, Theorem 6] for
standard properties of molliﬁcation.

We also deﬁne the partial-truncation function Πm(w) = |w|∧m

|w| w, with Πm(0) = 0; clearly, Πm
is Lipschitz and |Πm(w)| = |w| ∧ m. Most of the approximations in this proof will be of the form

in the Rd case and

gm(x) = (g ∗ ηm)(Πm(x))

(5.9)
in the R1+d+N ×d-case after extending the domain of f via f (t, x, z) = f (0, x, z) for t < 0, and
f (t, x, z) = f (T, x, z) when t > T . The same, superscript-m, notation will be used without
explicit mention, when this operation is applied to other functions below.

f m(t, x, z) = (f ∗ ηm)(t, Πm(x), Πm(z))

, one easily checks that each gm is Lipschitz, the sequence (gm) is bounded

(1) For g ∈ C {αn}

, and the convergence gm → g follows from the standard properties of molliﬁcation.

(2) Given a function f satisfying the assumptions in part (2), since the convolution f ∗ ηm is
smooth, and Πm is Lipschitz and bounded, each approximation f m is globally Lipschitz in all of
its variables. Furthermore, when zm → z, we have Πm(zm) = zm for sufﬁciently large m and,
so, using the properties that molliﬁcations of a continuous function converge locally uniformly, we
have f m → f locally uniformly in z.

GLOBALLY SOLVABLE BSDE SYSTEMS

37

To verify the condition BFe for f m, we ﬁx n ∈ N, and start with the quadratic-triangular com-
ponent q. Thanks to the fact that η is of compact support, all components qm,i of the approximation
qm have the following property

|qm,i(t, x, z)| ≤ Cn(2 +Pi

j=1 |zj|2) ≤ 2Cn(1 +Pi

Therefore qm is quadratic-triangular as well, with C ′
n = 2Cn. A similar argument can be applied
to e. For k, it follows from [Eva98, Appendix C.4, Theorem 6 (iv)] that km converges to k in
Lqn([0, T ] × Bn) for each n; in particular, the sequence ||km||Lqn ([0,T ]×Bn), which differs from
||f m(·,·, 0)||Lqn ([0,T ]×Bn) only by a constant, is bounded in m.
For l, a direct approximation of d(t, x, z) = diag(zl(t, x, z)) does not produce the function in
the same class; it needs an adjustment by a subquadratic term. To see that we note that

j=1 |zj|2) on [0, T ] × Bn × RN ×d.

dm(t, x, z) = diag(z lm(t, x, z)) − Lm(t, x, z),

where dm(t, x, z) = (d ∗ ηm)(t, Πm(x), Πm(z)) and

(Li)m(t, x, z) = Pd

j=1(lji ∗ ˆηm

ij )(t, Πm(x), Πm(z)) and (ˆηm)ij(t, x, z) = zijηm(t, x, z).

The function lm grows at most linearly, with the constant C ′
n bounded from above by Cn multiplied
by a constant which depends only on d and N. On the other hand, the components of Lm are
molliﬁcations of linearly-growing functions by kernels ˆηm
ij , all of which are dominated by ηm in
absolute value. Therefore, the functions Lm are of subquadratic growth, uniformly in m.

The subquadratic growth of s ensures the same property for sm, uniformly in m, perhaps with
n. Therefore, each f m admits a decomposition as in (5.8) into the
(cid:3)

a different growth bound κ′
functions dm + Lm, qm, sm − Lm, em and km which have all the required properties.
5.3.2. Existence of Lyapunov pairs. Proposition 5.5 below conﬁrms Proposition 2.10 and Remark
2.14 part (1). Its proof is partially based on a construction in [BF02b, Proposition 3.1, p. 174].
Proposition 5.5. Let {f m} be a sequence in BFe({Cn},{κn},{qn},{εn}) with ||f m(·,·, 0)||Lqn ([0,T ]×Bn)
bounded, for each n ∈ N. Then, for each sequence {cn} of positive numbers, there exists a
sequence {¯εn} in (0,∞) such that if εn ≤ ¯εn for all n, there exists families {hn} and {km
n }
such that, for each m, ({hn},{km
n }) is a local {cn}-Lyapunov pair for f m. In particular, when
{Cn},{κn},{qn} and {εn} are constants in n, there exists a c-Lyapunov pair for f , for any c > 0.
Proof. We restrict the spatial domain to Bn and suppress the subscript n throughout the proof.
When {Cn},{κn},{qn} and {εn} are constants in n, the spatial domain is Rd. Since {f m} satisﬁes
the approximate condition (BF ) with uniform growth sequences {Cn}, {κn}, {qn} and {εn}, we
suppress the superscript m as well. For y = (y1, . . . , yN ) ∈ RN and k = 1, . . . , N, we deﬁne

Gk(y) = cosh(αkyk)

and

Sk(y) = sinh(αkyk),

with α1, . . . , αN > 0 to be determined later. Recursively, we set

that the left-hand side of the previous inequality is positive, and continue this process recursively

smaller than ε0, we pick ε′ < ε0 − ε and set

5.3.3. Conclusion of the Proof of Theorem 2.13. Let g and f be two functions which satisfy the
conditions of Theorem 2.13, namely g is in C {αn}
and of subquadratic growth, f satisﬁes the
conditions (AB) and the approximate condition (BF). We start by picking a sequence (f m, gm)
of Lipschitz approximations constructed in Proposition 5.4. Thanks to the Lipschitz property of
all ingredients, each approximate system (2.5) admits a continuous Markovian solution (vm, wm)
(see, e.g., [EKPQ97, Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.1]). Moreover, the Lipschitz approximations
f m satisfy the condition (AB), of Deﬁnition 2.11, possibly with the same positively-spanning
set a1, . . . , aK, and a possibly different, but m-independent, L1-function l. The existence of the
latter - as the supremum of a family of ﬁner and ﬁner molliﬁcations of an integrable function -
is guaranteed by the Hardy-Littlewood maximal theorem. Similarly, the approximations gm of
the terminal condition g satisfy the inequality |gm(x)| ≤ ζ(x) uniformly in m, for some smooth
function ζ with lim|x|→∞ ζ(x)/ |x|2 = 0.
Let a1, . . . , aK be a positive spanning set from condition (AB). Given k ∈ {1, . . . , K}, we

It remains to use the following fact: a sequence {vm} in RN for which the
sequence {a⊤vm} is bounded from above for each a in some positive spanning set of RN, is
itself bounded in RN. Indeed, since the i-th canonical base ei for RN can be positively spanned
by ei = λi
i vm =

Moreover, using only the function l and the positive spanning set a1, . . . , aK of condition

way we obtain a sequence - namely {cn} with each cn = c - independently of the other constants

larity in the deﬁnition the sequence {¯εn} of Proposition 5.5, that enforces the ‘smallness’ condition
on the ‘error’ term in the (BF)-decomposition of f .
Whether g is bounded or unbounded, we have produced a sequence {cn} of a-priori bounds
that can be used together with the sequences {f m} and {gm} in Proposition 5.5 to construct local

(both in n and m) under the condition (a) of Theorem 2.13. Moreover, due to the absence of
dependence on n in (b), a c-Lyapunov pair (h, k) with constant k can be constructed for any c. The
fact that any bounded continuous solution is a-priori bounded by the constant c constructed above,
together with the local Lipschitz condition in (c), is enough to apply the abstract uniqueness result
Theorem 2.8, part (2).

5.4. Proofs for examples.

5.4.1. Proof of Theorem 3.1. Consider the following system of BSDE

d ˜Yt = ˜f (t, Xt, ˜Zt) dt + ˜Ztσ(t, Xt) dWt,

˜YT = g(XT ),

(5.11)

where

˜f (t, x, ˜z) = f ( ˜zσ(t, x))

and

f (z) = − 1

2 ν2 + 1

2 A[µ]2 − A[µ]µ with z = (µ, ν).

We will use Theorem 2.13 to establish the existence of a Höldearian solution (˜v, ˜w). Then (˜v, ˜wσ)
is a Höldearian solution of (3.1).

Let us ﬁrst verify the condition (AB). Let σi, i = 1, 2, be the i-th column vector of σ. Denote

˜µ = ˜zσ1 and ˜ν = ˜zσ2. Then

˜f = − 1

2 ˜ν2 + 1

Let (e1, . . . , eN ) be the standard Euclidean basis of RN , and aN +1 = (α1, . . . , αN ) where the
sequence of constants {αi} appears after (3.1). Then the set (−e1, . . . ,−eN , aN +1) positively span

and µ, ν, and g in a similar manner. A simple calculation reveals the dynamics of Y as

Y i = ˜Y i − ˜Y N ,

j=1 αjµj + µN(cid:17).

Using this, explicit, expression, one easily checks that f satisﬁes the condition (BF) of Deﬁnition
2.9. On the other hand, since ˜f already satisﬁes the condition (AB), after the linear transforma-
tion of RN, f satisﬁes (AB) as well (cf. Remark 2.12). Therefore the existence and uniqueness
of a bounded continuous solution to (5.12) (hence (5.11) and (3.1)) follows from Theorem 2.13.
Finally, when the terminal condition is bounded, combining Theorem 2.8 part (1) and [KXŽ15,
Theorem 1.6 (2)→(1)], we conﬁrm the existence of an equilibrium. Conversely any equilibrium

with continuous certainty equivalence functions corresponds to a continuous Markovian solution
of (3.1), which is already proven to be unique.

5.4.2. Proof of Proposition 3.4. We deﬁne the approximated driver f m by

(f m(y, z))k = 1

2 Pi,j Γk

ij(y)(cid:18)Πm(z)⊤Πm(z)(cid:19)ij

, for y ∈ RN, z ∈ RN ×d,

where Πm(z) = |z|∧m
|z| z for m ∈ N. Also, we construct a sequence (gm) of Lipschitz approxi-
mation of g as in Proposition 5.4. Molliﬁcation does not increase the L∞-norm and the set sub-
level set M0 = φ−1((−∞, 0]) is convex; therefore, the images of all gm remain inside M0, i.e.,
φ−1(gm(x)) ≤ 0, for all x and m.

The globally-Lipschitz structure of its ingredients implies that the approximated system

Once the a-priori boundedness of the approximating sequence {vm} is established, we can use
the strict geodesic convexity of φ on some neighborhood of M0 to conclude that φ can be suitably
redeﬁned on a complement of a neighborhood of M0 to serve, together with k = 0, as a c-Lyapunov
pair, for large enough c. Then the existence of a locally Hölderian solution to (3.2), with YT =
g(WT ), readily follows from Theorem 2.7.
5.4.3. Proof of Proposition 3.6. Let us ﬁrst argue that a solution (Y , Z) with ( ˆµ(Z), ˆν(Z)) ∈
bmo2 to (3.5) corresponds to a Nash equilibrium. For a given µ ∈ bmo, we consider the process

Thanks to the fact that h1 and g1 are both bounded and µ, ˆν ∈ bmo, ˜Y 1 is bounded. Since X
generates the same ﬁltration as W , the martingale representation implies the existence of a process

yields ˜Y 1

the second player as well.

0 ≥ ˆY 1

For the existence and uniqueness of (Y , Z), we verify all conditions in Theorem 2.13. Introduce
an invertible linear transformation on R2 via ˜y1 = y1 − y2 and ˜y2 = y2. Deﬁne ˜z, ˜g similarly, and
consider the BSDE
(5.13)

˜YT = ˜g(XT ),

where

˜f 1(x, ˜z) =

d ˜Yt = − ˜f (Xt, ˜Zt) dt + ˜Zt dWt,
2(1+θ)(1−θ) ˜z1 · ( ˜z1 + 2 ˜z2) + h1(x) − h2(x)

2θ−1

Using this explicit expression, one easily checks that ˜f satisﬁes the condition (BF).

Next we show that f satisﬁes the condition (wAB), hence ˜f satisﬁes the same condition as well.

To this end, calculation shows that

L1(z) = −

A similar inequality holds for L2(z). Therefore using the fact that h is bounded, we obtain func-
tions Li such that e⊤

When θ ≤ 1/2, using the ﬁrst identity above, we obtain

(1+θ)2(1−θ)2|z1 + z2|2.

As a result, f satisﬁes the condition (wAB) with the positively spanning set (e1, e2, a3).

When θ > 1, consider a3 = (−θ, 1) and a4 = (1,−θ). We have from (3.4) that

5.4.4. Proof of Proposition 3.7. It is clear that the generator of system (3.6) satisﬁes the condition
(BF) and (wAB) when g is bounded ((AB) when g is unbounded). Then the existence (and unique-
ness for bounded g) readily follows from Theorem 2.13. Given the bounded continuous solution,
Z = w(·, X) ∈ bmo, hence [EKH03, Proposition 5.1] concludes that ( ˆµ, ˆν) is a Nash equilibrium
with value (exp(v1), exp(v2)).
