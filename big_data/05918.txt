We calculate the ﬁrst two moments and full probability distribution of the work performed on
a system of bosonic particles in a two-mode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian when the self-interaction
term is varied instantaneously or with a ﬁnite-time ramp. In the instantaneous case, we show how
the irreversible work scales diﬀerently depending on whether the system is driven to the Josephson
or Fock regime of the bosonic Josephson junction. In the ﬁnite-time case, we use optimal control
techniques to substantially decrease the irreversible work to negligible values. Our analysis can be
implemented in present-day experiments with ultracold atoms and we show how to relate the work
statistics to that of the population imbalance of the two modes.

INTRODUCTION

Thermodynamics survived all the scientiﬁc revolutions
we witnessed in the last centuries. In the early days, ther-
modynamics has been applied to macroscopic systems
with a number of particles of the order or larger than
the Avogadro number. This implies that when repeat-
ing a thermodynamic process under the same conditions,
the observed values of thermodynamic quantities such as
work, entropy and heat would always be the same. Re-
cently, motivated by experiments in mesoscopic systems
in solid state physics, molecular biology and in optical
and atomic physics, attention has been turned to the
ﬂuctuations of thermodynamic quantities satisfying fun-
damental theorems [1, 2]. Such ﬂuctuations can have a
two-fold origin: they can be merely due to the smallness
of mesoscopic systems giving rise to classical statistical
ﬂuctuations; or, they can be intrinsically quantum ﬂuc-
tuations.

In the context of work in quantum mechanics, it has
been shown that work cannot be identiﬁed with a single
observable but rather to a generalised measurement [3–
8]. Quantum ﬂuctuations of work, in contrast to classical
thermal ﬂuctuations, survive when the temperature is
lowered close to the absolute zero. Their origins can be
traced to the non-commutativity of operators in quantum
mechanics: they emerge when driving a system with a
sequence of Hamiltonians that do not commute with each
other [9]. Such observation leaves an open question: how
can one access the quantum ﬂuctuations of work for a
quantum mesoscopic system?

The aim of this paper is to answer positively to this
question by studying the ﬂuctuations of work generated
by or made on a system of ultracold atoms in a double
well potential. Recent technological and experimental
progress in the ﬁeld of cold atomic gases has triggered
an enormous research activity towards the realisation of
quantum simulators of condensed matter physics models,

quantum metrology and quantum information processors
[10–12]. Far less attention has been devoted to applica-
tions of out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics in ultracold
atoms [7] with the exception of the issue of thermalisation
in closed quantum systems [13, 14].

Here, we consider a zero-temperature bosonic gas sub-
ject to a double-well potential. In the so-called two-mode
approximation, the system can be regarded as a bosonic
Josephson junction [15, 16] and its physics has been ex-
tensively studied both theoretically [17–20] and exper-
imentally [21–26]. We calculate the work ﬂuctuations
in such setup after changing the inter-particle interac-
tion strength by means of a Feshbach resonance. Simi-
lar eﬀects could be obtained by changing the potential,
raising or lowering the barrier separating the two wells.
For slow adiabatic changes of the interaction, the work
needed to drive the system is approximately given by the
free energy diﬀerence ∆F of the initial and ﬁnal equilib-
rium states. However for fast driving the average work
is always larger than ∆F and their diﬀerence gives the
irreversible work. We analyse the dependence of the ir-
reversible work on the initial and ﬁnal values of the self-
interaction constant spanning the Rabi, Josephson and
Fock regime of the double-well system.

Furthermore, with the aim of reducing the irreversible
work production, we employ optimal control methods
to ﬁnd a tailored time-dependence of the self-interaction
[27]. We ﬁnd that the irreversible work can be eﬀectively
reduced to a negligible value even if driving the system
at a ﬁnite speed, challenging the minimal work principle
[28]. We test the robustness of our protocol to imperfec-
tions in the values of the self-interaction.

Our results can be tested in present-day experiments
with ultracold atoms in double-well potentials [21–26] or
realising instances of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG)
[29, 30] as for instance Bose-Einstein condensates in op-
tical cavities [31]. In the conclusions, we discuss a scheme
to estimate work ﬂuctuations in such systems.

II. MODEL

The system considered is a zero-temperature Bose-
Einstein condensate in a double-well potential. For our
study we use the two-mode Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian

where J and U are respectively the tunneling and the
self-interaction energies and the number of particles N is
assumed to be constant. The operators ˆaL and ˆaR are
the particle annihilation operators in the left and right
well, respectively, and ˆnL and ˆnR are the corresponding
number operators.

We analyse the system by using both a numerical and
an analytical approach in order to ﬁnd the eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian. The analytical results are obtained
by mapping the double-well to a quantum harmonic os-
cillator (QHO). In order to do that, we introduce the
Schwinger operators

We now map Hamiltonian (5) into that of a QHO em-
ploying the Holstein-Primakoﬀ approximation, valid in
the Josephson and Rabi regimes [22]. We remind that the
system is in the Rabi and the Josephson regimes respec-

population imbalance, is related to the position opera-

ˆJy = −(cid:112)N/2 ˆp. Hence the double-well system can be

including all the regimes for N = 100. In the bottom panel,
the dashed line corresponds to the QHO analytical predic-

and similarly for other high order moments.

Within this framework, knowing the eigenstates of the
QHO, we are able to compare both numerical and an-
alytical results of the statistics of work which we now
deﬁne. Suppose that we prepare a quantum system in
the ground state |ψ0(cid:105) of an initial Hamiltonian ˆHi with
energy E0. The Hamiltonian is then changed in time,
not necessarily in an adiabatic fashion, reaching at time
τ the Hamiltonian ˆHf with eigenvalues and eigenstates:

10-21100104(Uf-Ui)/J1100104WquantJ10-21100104Uf-UiJ0.11001051081011ΔW2/J210-21100104(Uf-Ui)/J10-40.1100105Wirr/J(cid:88)

{ ˜Eq,| ˜ψq(cid:105)}. The change in the Hamiltonian induces an
evolution operator that maps the initial state into |ψ(τ )(cid:105).
Then, the probability density function of the work done
on the system is:

P (W ) =

|(cid:104) ˜ψq|ψ(τ )(cid:105)|2δ(W − ˜Eq + E0).

(10)

q

A similar distribution can be analogously deﬁned for an
arbitrary initial state and for non unitary evolutions.

The average work done for the quench in a ﬁnite time,

is then obtained as the ﬁrst moment of P (W ):
(cid:104)W(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ(τ )| ˆHf|ψ(τ )(cid:105) − (cid:104)ψ0| ˆHi|ψ0(cid:105) .

(11)

The variance of the work, deﬁned as

∆W 2 = (cid:104)W 2(cid:105) − (cid:104)W(cid:105)2 ,

(12)
with (cid:104)W 2(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ(τ )|( ˆHf − E0)2|ψ(τ )(cid:105), is useful because
it gives information about the ﬂuctuations of the work.
Thanks to the Jarzynski relation, it holds the relation
(cid:104)W(cid:105) ≥ ∆F , where ∆F = ˜E0 − E0 is the ﬁnal-initial
ground state energy diﬀerence. Since the equality holds
in case of an adiabatic process, in the following we study
the irreversible work Wirr = (cid:104)W(cid:105) − ∆F which measures
the amount of wasted work during the transformation.

III.

INSTANTANEOUS QUENCH

We start our analysis with an instantaneous quench in
which we vary either the self-interaction energy U or the
tunneling J. Under this assumption, |ψ(τ )(cid:105) = |ψ0(cid:105) and
the expectation value of (11) is reduced to the evaluation
on the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian, hence

(cid:104)W(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ0|( ˆHf − ˆHi)|ψ0(cid:105) = (cid:104)ψ0| ˆHf|ψ0(cid:105) − E0.

(13)

We evaluate the work done on the system going
through all the regimes by keeping ﬁxed Ui and changing
Uf and vice versa. By using the mapping to the QHO
as shown in Eq. (6) and the results in Eqs. (7-9), we ﬁnd
the following analytical results for the average work done
on the system, its variance and the irreversible work

Wirr =

(16)
where ∆U = Uf − Ui and ωi, ωf are the initial and ﬁnal
plasma frequencies.

Analogously, in Fig. 2 we study the case in which we
keep ﬁxed the ﬁnal parameter Uf and vary the initial
one Ui going through every of the three regimes of the
bosonic Josephson junction. Analogously to the previous
case, for the average work, we consider only its quantum
component (18).

As expected, the analytical results (green dotted lines)
given by Eqs.
(18), (15), (16) ﬁt the numerical ones
(blue dots) for Ui < 103J, because for larger values of
Ui, with the parameters used here, the system is in the
Fock regime. This limitation of the analytical approach is
due to the fact that in this regime the Holstein-Primakoﬀ
approximation does not work anymore and the eigen-
states of the initial Hamiltonian can not be described
as the ones of the QHO. In order to show the results on a
log-log graphic, we considered the absolute values of the
analysed quantities, since for Ui > Uf , i.e. at the right
of the grey dotted line in the graphics, the average work
has a negative value, corresponding to work extraction.
Furthermore, as done for the previous case in which we
change Uf , we analyse the limiting cases for UiN

So far we have limited our analysis to the ﬁrst two mo-
ments of work and the irreversible work. The full distri-
bution of work can calculated in a similar way. As shown
in Eq. (18), the quantum part of the work is propor-
tional to the square of the population imbalance. Since
this quantity is approximately Gaussian in the Rabi and
Josephson regime, we expect Wquant to be distributed
according to an exponential function:

(cid:115)

(26)

where σ = J∆U N/ωi. The relation (26) works quite well
in the Josephson regime as shown in Fig. 3. As it can
be noticed from this plot, for higher values of the work,
the analytical and numerical results present a progressive
slight shift. This is probably due to the fact that in
the Holstein-Primakoﬀ approximation we are neglecting
higher-order terms, hence the spacing between the energy
levels in the Bose-Hubbard model may not be exactly the
same as in the QHO.

5

We now turn to a transformation in which we vary the
work parameter U in a ﬁnite time τ . As we saw in the
previous sections, the properties of the bosonic Josephson
junction are well captured by the QHO away from the
Fock regime. We thus expect that even for the dynamics
such mapping still holds. In our analysis, we compare the
numerical results obtained for the work ﬂuctuations by
using the Bose-Hubbard model with the semi-analytical
results obtained from the approach of Ford et al. [32] for
the evolution of the ground state in a QHO with a time-
dependent frequency (see Appendix A for the detailed
calculations). Previous works have investigated the work
distribution of a QHO, for the case of a linear ramp for
the squared frequency [33], i.e. ω2(t) = ω2
1)t/τ ,
and for a generic ramp [32].

0−(ω2

0−ω2

We start our analysis with a linear ramp for U (t):

Ulin(t) = Ui + (Uf − Ui)

t
τ

.

(27)

The results for the variance of work and irreversible work
are shown in Fig. 4. In order to compare the numerical
results with the time evolution of the QHO, we notice
that since the plasma frequency squared is a linear func-
tion of U (t), for the ramp in Eq. (27), we are considering
the same case of [33]. The results show that both irre-
versible work and variance of work decay with the ramp
duration τ . This is analogous to the analysis in [33] with
the adiabaticity parameter Q. Moreover we observe oscil-
lations in both quantities as a function of τ . These can be
associated with parametric time oscillations of the vari-
ance of the population imbalance around the variance of
the instantaneous ground state. Thus, the irreversible
work is directly related to squeezing and anti-squeezing
of the population imbalance in time. Such conjecture is
conﬁrmed in Appendix A.

Furthermore, having a semi-analytical form of the
transition probability pτ
q,0 (A10), we obtain both numer-
ical and analytical results for the probability distribution
of the work, deﬁned as

P (W ) =

|pτ
q,0|2δ(W − qωi).

q

Even in this case, we obtain a shift between numerical
and analytical results similar to the one obtained for a
sudden quench, shown in Fig. 3.

V. OPTIMAL CONTROL

It is natural to expect that for a given duration τ , the
irreversible work should depend on the actual time de-
pendence of the self-interaction U (t). The aim of this sec-
tion is to ﬁnd the best ramp U (t) that minimises Wirr for
ﬁxed τ . Previous attempts to reduce irreversible work in
quantum harmonic oscillators [34, 35] and systems within

(cid:88)

the linear response regime [36] have been reported. Our
goal is a standard optimal control problem [37] which
we approach considering two types of chopped basis: the
ﬁrst a linear ramp plus a truncated Fourier expansion,
similar to [27], and a polynomial.

For these functions we impose the boundary conditions
U (0) = Ui and U (τ ) = Uf and we enforce the plasma
frequency ω(t) = 2J
2J + 1 to be real for every t.
We optimized the free parameters of every kind of ramp
and compared the results of the irreversible work with
the case of the linear ramp Ulin(t), Eq. (27).

In a ﬁrst attempt, we use one ramp from each class
with four parameters of which, given the boundary con-
ditions, two are free. The ﬁrst one is a linear ramp with
two sinusoidal terms, having the form

of the oscillating terms is chosen to have at least one
oscillation during the ramp. The second kind of ramp
analysed is a cubic polynomial:

the linear ramp for every τ . The most eﬃcient optimiza-
tions are obtained with the 4-parameters ramps U2LCS(t)
and Uq(t), for which the irreversible work reaches a value
smaller than 10−4J after a time τ = 0.1/J. For the other
ramps the value of the dissipated work is always larger
and approaches zero for much higher values of τ . In par-
ticular, for smaller values of the duration of the quench,
i.e. 0 < Jτ < 0.08, the ramp ULCS is more eﬃcient than
the cubic, but for 0.08 < Jτ < 0.3, the best optimization
is granted by the cubic and the quintic, which reach a zero
value of the dissipated work respectively from τ = 0.08/J
and τ = 0.1/J.

For the case examined above,

On the basis of these results regarding the eﬃciency of
the optimization process, we analysed the stability of the
optimal parameters obtained for every ramp. In order to
do that, for every ansatz, we associate a relative percent-
age error to each parameter, we evaluate the work done
on the system for random variations of the parameters
inside the range given by the errors, and we consider the
average and standard deviation of the irreversible work.
i.e. Ui = 0.2J and
Uf = 0.8J, we obtain the maximum stability for the
ansatz ULCS, where variations up to the 20% of the op-
timal parameters give variations on the irreversible work
between the 0.2% and the 8%, except for the cases of
τ = 0.08/J and τ = 0.1/J for which the variations are
higher, respectively of the 13.6% and the 11.4%. The re-
sults of this tolerance analysis are shown in Fig. 7. For
the cubic ramp, in order to obtain the same kind of re-
sults gained for the ramp ULCS, we consider ﬂuctuations
of the parameters up to the 5% of their value, obtaining
variations in the irreversible work between the 0.5% and
the 14%, with higher peaks of the 61.5% and the 40% re-
spectively for τ = 0.1J and τ = 0.3J. The enhancement
in the stability obtained with the ansatz ULCS is due to
the fact that, as shown in Fig. 5, variations of A1 tend
to leave the irreversible work in a minimum, hence the
major contribution to changes in the value of the work
is given by B1. On the other hand, for the cubic ramp,
the minima of the oscillations cross diﬀerent values of
both A2 and A3, hence both the oscillations contribute
to the variations of the irreversible work. Although the
ansatz U2LCS gives the best eﬃciency, for the values of U
analysed, it is the most unstable. It would probably be
possible to minimize the work analysing a diﬀerent range
of parameters, reducing the eﬃciency of the optimization
in order to enhance its stability, but the lack of a graph-
ical representation for the case of four free parameters
analysis makes it harder to ﬁnd a stable range.

We also examine transitions in diﬀerent regimes, going
from an initial value Ui = 0.8J in the Josephson regime to
a ﬁnal one Uf = 40J in the Fock regime. In this case, the
most eﬃcient ansatz are ULCS and U2LCS, whose results
of the irreversible work are the same from τ = 0.02/J and
for which a zero dissipated work is reached at τ = 0.04/J.
It is observed that with the cubic and the quintic the
stability is enhanced, although the eﬃciency is lower, i.e.
with the quintic ramp we ﬁnd a dissipated work equal to

FIG. 5: (Color online) Irreversible work vs the parameters A1
and B2 calculated for the ansatz ULCS(t) (Linear+Cos+Sin
ramp) for the values Ui = 0.2J, Uf = 0.8J and τ = 0.1/J.

where the free parameters A2 and A3 are optimized. For
this case the boundary conditions impose A0 = Ui and
A1 = Uf − Ui − A2 − A3.

For comparison we consider also other ramps with four
free parameters. In the ﬁrst one we add two frequencies
to the ramp ULCS(t), hence we consider A1, B1, A2 and
B2 as free parameters in

In each of these cases, the condition of reality imposed
on ω(t) gives a restriction on the possible values of one
of the free parameters, depending on the values of the
other ones. The choice of the parameters range analysed
is done on the basis of both eﬃciency and stability, by
observing the dependence of the irreversible work on the
free parameters which, for the ansatz having two free pa-
rameters, can be represented graphically as in Fig. 5. The
plot of the irreversible work versus the free parameters
for the ramp ULSC(t) in Fig. 5 shows oscillations of the
irreversible work, whose amplitudes increase for larger
values of the parameter B1. Nevertheless, this kind of
considerations derived from a graphical representation is
hard to extend to the case of more than two free param-
eters, but we expect a similar potential landscape [38].

The optimized results of the irreversible work obtained
for every ramp as a function of the ramp duration τ
are compared in Fig. 6 and reported in Fig. I for con-
venience. With each of these ramps we obtain a sub-
stantial decrease in the dissipated work with respect to

zero at τ = 0.1/J and for the cubic this is obtained at
τ = 0.4/J, hence in this case a good compromise between
optimization eﬃciency and stability would be the quintic
ramp.

For the two cases examined we have found diﬀerent re-
sults regarding the eﬃciency and the stability of the op-
timization, and this can be probably due to the fact that
diﬀerent boundary conditions give diﬀerent constraints
to the values that the parameters can assume. For this
reason, we do not expect the kind of parameters land-
scape such as the one represented in Fig. 5 to be the
same in that range of parameter values for transitions
with diﬀerent values of Ui and Uf .

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have analysed the ﬂuctuations of the
work done on an ensemble of ultracold atoms in a two-site
Bose-Hubbard model. We have carefully shown analyt-
ical predictions for the ﬁrst two moments of work and
the irreversible work for instantaneous quenches. In this

values Ui = 0.2J and Uf = 0.8J. The blue line corresponds
to the linear ramp, the orange crosses to the linear+Sin+Cos
ramp, the triangles to the ramp U2LCS(t), the green points
and the diamonds respectively to the cubic and quintic ones.

parameters (orange dots) and as an average for random ﬂuc-

optimal values for A1 and B1 respectively (blue dots). These
results are obtained for Ui = 0.2J and Uf = 0.8J.

regime we have predicted that the probability distribu-
tion of work is well described by an exponential function
in agreement with that of a quantum harmonic oscillator.
For ﬁnite time ramps, we have analysed the case of a
linear ramp in time demonstrating oscillations of the ir-
reversible work that are synchronous with the squeezing
oscillations of the population imbalance distribution. Fi-
nally we have used simple optimal control techniques to
minimise the irreversible work to negligible values. This
result might have applications in the realisation of quan-
tum thermal machines with ultracold atoms and in the
quest to maximise their eﬃciencies.

It is natural to expect further decrease of the irre-
versible work using a larger chopped basis for the time-
dependent ramp. Moreover, one could use more sophisti-
cated schemes as the one in [27], in which the frequencies
of the oscillating terms are chosen random, or the Kro-
tov’s method [37]. Our analysis is therefore a starting
point for a more systematic study.

Finally, let us discuss possible experimental veriﬁca-
tions of our analysis. The two-site Bose-Hubbard model
can be realised in diﬀerent setups with ultracold atoms

species, in self-organised condensates in optical cavities
[21, 24, 31, 39]. It is worth to stress the fact that (18)
is an interesting result because it shows that we can re-
construct the statistics of the work, at least the ﬁrst two
moments, experimentally by measuring only one observ-
able, i.e. the square of the population imbalance, rather
than doing two measurements on the energy of the sys-
tem or by coupling the system to an external quantum
probe.

Appendix A: Work distribution of a QHO

In this section we revise the dynamics of the paramet-
rically driven quantum harmonic oscillator and how to
calculate the work distribution. Let us assume the QHO
to be driven with Hamiltonian Eq. (6) from an initial fre-
quency ω(0) = ωi to a ﬁnal one ω(τ ) = ω1. An initial
energy eigenfunction of a QHO evolves into [32, 40]

where in the last passage we used the Gaussian integral
It can be noticed that in
the case of an adiabatic ramp, since the evolved state
at the time τ is an eigenstate of the ﬁnal Hamiltonian,
(cid:104)x2(cid:105) will be the variance of the ground state for the ﬁnal
Hamiltonian.

In Fig. 8 ,we compare the analytical result from (A5)
with the one we obtained numerically by using a Trotter
expansion of the evolution operator and to the instanta-
neous variance, deﬁned as (cid:104)x2(t)(cid:105) = J/ω(t). As the fre-
quency ω(t) is increased, the system wavefunction tries
to catch-up with the instantaneous value of the variance
and start oscillating around it. The slower is the driving
the smaller is the amplitude of these squeezing oscilla-
tions.

To calculate the probability distribution of the work

we need the transition probability
