The recent announcement of the detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration
has opened a new window to test the nature of astrophysical black holes. Konoplya & Zhidenko
have shown how the LIGO data of GW 150914 can constrain possible deviations from the Kerr
metric. In this letter, we compare their constraints with those that can be obtained from accreting
black holes by ﬁtting their reﬂected X-ray spectrum, the so-called iron line method. We simulate
observations with eXTP, a next generation X-ray mission, ﬁnding constraints much stronger than
those obtained by Konoplya & Zhidenko. Our results can at least show that, contrary to what is
quite commonly believed, it is not obvious that gravitational waves are the most powerful approach
to test strong gravity. In the presence of high quality data and with the systematics under control,
the iron line method may provide competitive constraints.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Ref. [11]. The line element reads

In the past 50 years, Solar System experiments and
radio observations of binary pulsars have tested general
relativity in the weak ﬁeld limit [1]. The focus of cur-
rent experiments has now shifted to testing the theory in
other regimes. In this context, an important line of re-
search is devoted to conﬁrm the nature of astrophysical
black holes [2–6]. In 4-dimensional general relativity, an
uncharged black hole is described by the Kerr solution,
which is completely characterised by the mass M and the
spin angular momentum J of the compact object. The
spacetime geometry around astrophysical black holes is
expected to be very close to the Kerr metric and there-
fore possible deviations from the Kerr solution could only
arise from new physics [2].

The LIGO/Vigo collaboration has recently announced
the detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence
of two stellar-mass black holes [7]. The event was named
GW 150914. The mass of the ﬁnal black hole is esti-
mated to be M = 62+4−4 M(cid:12) and its dimensionless spin
parameter would be a∗ = 0.67+0.05−0.07. The possibility of
detecting gravitational waves opens now a new window
to study general relativity in the strong ﬁeld regime and
to test the nature of astrophysical black holes [8, 9].

In Ref. [10], Konoplya & Zhidenko have employed a
parametrised approach to get a simple estimate on how
the data of GW 150914 can test the nature of black holes
and constrain possible deviations from the Kerr solu-
tion. Their parametrisation is based on the proposal of

ds2 = − N 2(r, θ) − W 2(r, θ) sin2 θ

and a = J/M is the rotation parameter. The deformation
parameter η can be written as

η = r0

(3)

where r0 is the radial coordinate of the event horizon of
the black hole metric in (1). If we write

r0 = rKerr + δr = M +

M 2 − a2 + δr ,

(4)

(cid:112)

we can use δr as the deformation parameter to quantify
possible deviations from the Kerr spacetime. If δr = 0,
r0 reduces to the radial position of the event horizon of
a Kerr black hole. In the general case, δr measures the
diﬀerence of the radial coordinate of the event horizon

with respect to that of a Kerr black hole with the same
mass and spin.

The choice of the metric in Eq. (1) is somewhat ar-
bitrary, but it posses some nice properties.
It signif-
icantly simpliﬁes the calculations of the quasi-normal
modes, it is close to the Kerr metric at large distances
(it has the post-Newtonian parameters β = γ = 1 as the
Schwarzschild solution and the same mass quadrupole
moment as the Kerr spacetime Q = −a2M ), and it is
quite diﬀerent near the horizon [10].

In the case of the coalescence of two black holes in
the post-
a binary, we can distinguish three stages:
Newtonian inspiral, the merger, and the ringdown.
In
their analysis, Konoplya & Zhidenko only study the ring-
down phase, arguing that it is the most suitable to test
strong gravity. The post-Newtonian inspiral can indeed
be the same in many alternative theories of gravity, and
their metric is as the Kerr metric in the asymptotic re-
gion. The merger is a very short and complicated stage.
As a further simpliﬁcation, they study the quasi-normal
frequencies of a scalar ﬁeld in the deformed background.
In general relativity and in other theories of gravity, these
frequencies are not much diﬀerent from those of the grav-
itational waves derived from the ﬁeld equations. How-
ever, this is not always true and there are also examples
of gravity theories in which the scalar ﬁeld quasi-normal
frequencies can be quite diﬀerent from those of the grav-
itational waves. With such a simpliﬁcation, the quasi-
normal frequencies ω only depend on the background
metric and on the quantum numbers l and m; that is [10]

ω2 = ω2(M, a, δr, m, l) .

(5)

Within the WKB approximation [12, 13], the m =
l = 2 mode scalar ﬁeld quasi-normal frequency in a Kerr
background with a∗ = 0.65 is

ωM = 0.635 − 0.0901 i .

(6)

Fig. 1 in Ref. [10] shows that there is a degeneracy be-
tween the spin a∗ and possible deviations from the Kerr
metric δr.
In other words, the same quasi-normal fre-
quency may be associated either to a Kerr black hole
with spin a∗ = 0.65 or to a non-Kerr black hole with a
diﬀerent spin. Under this scope, the seminal detection of
GW 150914 does not seem so strong and large deviations
from the Kerr solution, at the level of δr/rKerr ≈ −0.8,
cannot be ruled out.

Generally speaking, the frequency of a quasi-normal
mode is characterised by a real and an imaginary part,
namely two parameters.
If we measure only one fre-
quency (as in the case of GW 150914) and we assume
the Kerr metric, this is enough to estimate M and a∗. If
we relax the Kerr black hole hypothesis, we have at least
one deformation parameter, and there may be a degen-
eracy. In the case of gravitational waves, the degeneracy
may be broken with the measurement of other modes,
but it depends on the metric. For instance, the measure-
ment of other modes does not seem to be very helpful to
distinguish Kerr and Kerr-Sen black holes [10].

2

Here we want to compare these constraints from grav-
itational waves from those that can be obtained from
X-ray data of accreting black holes. In particular, we are
interested in constraints from the iron line method [14].
Broad iron Kα lines are commonly observed in the X-ray
spectrum of black holes of all masses. They are gener-
ated by illumination of a cold accretion disk by a hot
corona. The analysis of the iron line actually involves
the ﬁtting of the whole reﬂected component of the disk,
but eventually the feature that can probe the spacetime
geometry in the strong gravity region is mainly the iron
Kα line. Studies to test the Kerr metric with the iron line
have been reported in [15–20], where it is shown that this
technique is potentially more powerful than the analysis
of the thermal spectrum to test black holes [21–23]. For
a review on the use of the two techniques to test the Kerr
metric, see e.g. Ref. [3].

II. X-RAY REFLECTION SPECTROSCOPY

A.

Iron line method

With the same spirit as the authors of Ref. [10], here we
perform a simpliﬁed analysis to compare the constraining
capability of gravitational waves and iron line to test the
nature of black holes. Since we want to compare our
results with those in Ref. [10], we use the metric in Eq. (1)
and the deformation parameter δr. Roughly speaking, we
can expect that current iron line measurements are at
the same level as the LIGO data of GW 150914, because
the spin parameter measurement of the ﬁnal black hole
in GW 150914 has an uncertainty comparable to that
obtainable from iron line measurements. However, the
two techniques are sensitive to quite diﬀerent relativistic
eﬀects.

As a very preliminary study, we follow the approach
of Ref. [18]. We compute the photon ﬂux of the iron
line proﬁle in diﬀerent background metrics over a grid of
energy bins with resolution ∆E = 100 eV in the range
1-9 keV. For simplicity, we ﬁx the emissivity index q, for
both the simulations and the model ﬁtting, to 3, which
corresponds to the Newtonian limit for lamppost coronal
geometry. The iron line proﬁle is added to a power-law
continuum, which is normalised to include 100 times the
number of iron line photons when integrated over the
energy range 1-9 keV. The photon index of the continuum
is Γ(cid:48) = 2. Depending on the line shape, this corresponds
to a line equivalent width of EW ≈ 370-440 eV.

Our simulated spectra include Poisson noise, are then
binned to achieve a threshold of counts n = 20, and ﬁtted
employing χ2 analysis. Fig. 1 shows the results of these
simulations. The reference model is a Kerr black hole
with spin parameter a(cid:48)
∗ = 0.65, as in the study in [10],
and observed from a viewing angle i(cid:48) = 45◦. We assume
that the number of photon counts in the iron line photon
is Nline = 104 (left panel) and Nline = 105 (right panel).
In these ﬁts, we have ﬁve free parameters: the spin pa-

black hole simulated using an input spin parameter a(cid:48)
∗ = 0.65 and an inclination angle i(cid:48) = 45◦ vs a set of non-Kerr black holes
with spin parameter a∗ and deformation parameter δr/rKerr. The red dot indicates the reference black hole. See the text for
more details.

B. Simulation of an observation with eXTP

To do a step further, we constrain the deformation
parameter δr/rKerr by simulating an observation with
eXTP, which is a China-Europe proposal for a next gen-
eration X-ray mission [24]. For this purpose, we have cho-
sen the stellar-mass black hole XTE J1752-223. The spin
parameter of this object was measured via the iron line
method in Ref. [25] and was found to be a∗ = 0.52± 111.

range 2-10 keV was ∼ 1.1 · 10−8 erg s−1 cm−2 [25]. Our
simulations are based on the parameters reported in [25].
In particular, we use their equivalent width of EW ≈
221 eV. While eXTP spectra are simulated with same
source brightness and same exposure time (42 ks), they
are able to reach a much higher total photon count, about
8 · 109 during the whole exposure. The photon count in
the iron line is Nline ∼ 107, and this explains why we
obtain much better constraints than those in Fig. 1 (see
below).

The results of these simulations are shown in Figs. 2

and 3. We have used Xspec with the model [26, 27]

TBabs*(powerlaw+relconv*xillver+NKL)

where NKL is the iron line in the non-Kerr metric in (2)
from our code [15, 22]. xillver already includes the
iron line, but we have kept its normalisation low to have
a reasonable equivalent width in the iron line produced

1 Among the spin measurements reported in the literature of
stellar-mass black holes, there is no source with a spin estimate
very close to a∗ = 0.65, see e.g. Tab. 1 in Ref. [3]. The spin
measurement of XTE J1752-223 is not too far.

rameter a∗, the deformation parameter δr, the viewing
angle i, the ratio between the continuum and the iron
line photon ﬂux K, and the index of the continuum Γ.

These plots can be compared with the plot presented
in Ref. [10]. Both our analysis and that in Ref. [10] are
based on a simple model, so the constraints should be
taken as a general guide. Nevertheless, it is remarkable
that the constraining capability seems to be comparable.
In our case, EW ≈ 400 eV is quite an optimistic observa-
tion. For a bright AGN, current observations may have
Nline ≈ 103, but in the case of a bright black hole binary
we may already have Nline ≈ 105 or more.

the models

TBabs*(powerlaw+relconv*pexrav+NKL)

without ﬁnding substantial diﬀerences. The model with-
out reﬂection component and only our NKL clearly pro-
vides stronger constraints, which are likely too optimistic.
In the other two cases (xillver and pexrav), without
a correct non-Kerr reﬂected component, the ﬁnal con-
straint may be slightly worse than what we can actually
obtain, as other features should also change in a non-
Kerr background and provide some help to constrain the
spacetime geometry. We have not added any thermal
component to our model because the range of our spec-
trum is 2-10 keV (LFA) and 2-20 keV (LAD). The spectra
are rebinned to have a minimum count of 20 photons per
bin. The plots in Fig. 3 are also rebinned to have nicer
pictures.

The constraints in Fig. 2 look quite strong and, unlike
the constraints in Fig. 1 in [10] from GW 150914 and
those in Fig. 1 in our paper, they exclude the possibil-
ity of large deviations from Kerr.
In the eXTP simu-
lations, the allowed area is only that around a∗ = 0.52
and δr/rKerr = 0. While these simulations include the
noise of the instruments, the high ﬂux of XTE J1752-223
and the large eﬀective area of eXTP lead to Nline ∼ 107,
which is much higher than Nline used in Fig. 1.

III. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The aim of this letter was to compare the constrain-
ing power from the detection of gravitational waves and
the analysis of the iron Kα line to test the nature of
astrophysical black holes. The gravitational wave case
was discussed in Ref. [10] and here we have employed
the same set-up to study the iron line method. As we

have already stressed, both studies should be seen as a
preliminary work to provide a rough estimate of the ac-
tual capabilities of the two techniques. They both adopt
several simpliﬁcations that must be removed in future
studies.

Our results can at least show that, in the presence of
high quality data and with the systematics under control,
the iron line method can compete with the gravitational
wave approach to test black holes.
It is possible that
some kinds of deformation can be better constrained by
a technique and other kinds of deformations by the other
method. Research along these lines is currently under-
way.

Generally speaking, the observation of a single quasi-
normal mode, typically the l = m = 2 mode, provides
two parameters, and we can thus only measure two phys-
ical quantities. This is enough to infer the mass M and
the spin parameter a∗ if we assume the Kerr metric, but
it is not if we want to test the nature of a black hole. Even
if the accurate measurement of a single quasi-normal fre-
quency could constrain very well some kinds of deforma-
tions, it cannot surely do it for others. An accurate mea-
surement of more quasi-normal frequencies may break
this parameter degeneracy.

The proﬁle of the iron line has a complicated structure.
If properly understood, an accurate measurement of its

shape can provide much more details than the measure-
ment of a single quasi-normal mode. However, it is cru-
cial to use the correct astrophysical model. Current mod-
els are typically too simple to be considered realistic. For
instance, the emissivity proﬁle is usually modelled by two
power-law and a breaking radius, which is clearly an ap-
proximation. The next generation of X-ray missions, like
eXTP, will be able to provide unprecedented high quality
data, but it is necessary that at that time we have more
sophisticated astrophysical models than the phenomeno-
logical ones available today. The weak point of the iron
line method with respect to gravitational waves is mainly
related to the complication of the astrophysical system.
In the case of gravitational waves, the measurement can
be relatively clean [9].
