Abstract

Graphs embedded into surfaces have many important applications, in particular, in
combinatorics, geometry, and physics. For example, ribbon graphs and their counting
is of great interest in string theory and quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). Recently, Koch,
Ramgoolam, and Wen [Nuclear Phys. B 870 (2013), 530–581] gave a reﬁned formula
for counting ribbon graphs and discussed its applications to several physics problems.
An important factor in this formula is the number of surface-kernel epimorphisms from
a co-compact Fuchsian group to a cyclic group. The aim of this paper is to give an
explicit and practical formula for the number of such epimorphisms. As a consequence,
we obtain an ‘equivalent’ form of the famous Harvey’s theorem on the cyclic groups of
automorphisms of compact Riemann surfaces. Our main tool is an explicit formula for
the number of solutions of restricted linear congruence recently proved by Bibak et al.
using properties of Ramanujan sums and of the ﬁnite Fourier transform of arithmetic
functions.

Introduction

A surface is a compact oriented two-dimensional topological manifold. Roughly speaking, a
surface is a space that ‘locally’ looks like the Euclidean plane. Informally, a graph is said to
be embedded into (or drawn on) a surface if it can be drawn on the surface in such a way
that its edges meet only at their endpoints. A ribbon graph is a ﬁnite and connected graph
together with a cyclic ordering on the set of half edges incident to each vertex. One can
see that ribbon graphs and embedded graphs are essentially equivalent concepts; that is, a
ribbon graph can be thought as a set of disks (or vertices) attached to each other by thin
stripes (or edges) glued to their boundaries. There are several other names for these graphs
in the literature, for example, fat graphs, or combinatorial maps, or unrooted maps. For a

thorough introduction to the theory of embedded graphs we refer the reader to the lovely
book by Lando and Zvonkin [13].

Graphs embedded into surfaces have many important applications, in particular, in com-
binatorics, geometry, and physics. For example, ribbon graphs and their counting is of great
interest in string theory and quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). Here we quote some of these
applications and motivations from [11, 12]:

• Ribbon graphs arise in the context of MHV rules for constructing amplitudes.

In
the MHV rules approach to amplitudes, inspired by twistor string theory, amplitudes
are constructed by gluing MHV vertices. Counting ribbon graphs play an important
role here in ﬁnding diﬀerent ways of gluing the vertices which contribute to a given
amplitude.

• The number of ribbon graphs is the fundamental combinatorial element in perturbative
large N QFT computations, since we need to be able to enumerate the graphs and then
compute corresponding Feynman integrals.

• In matrix models (more speciﬁcally, the Gaussian Hermitian and complex matrix mod-
els), which can be viewed as QFTs in zero dimensions, the correlators are related very
closely to the combinatorics of ribbon graphs. There is also a two-dimensional structure
(related to string worldsheets) to this combinatorics.

• There is a bijection between vacuum graphs of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and
ribbon graphs. In fact, the number of QED/Yukawa vacuum graphs with 2v vertices
is equal to the number of ribbon graphs with v edges. This can be proved using
permutations. Note that QED is an Abelian gauge theory with the symmetry circle
group U(1).

Mednykh and Nedela [18] obtained a formula for the number of unrooted maps of a given
genus. Recently, Koch, Ramgoolam, and Wen [12] gave a reﬁnement of that formula to
make it more suitable for applications to several physics problems, like the ones mentioned
above.
In both formulas, there is an important factor, namely, the number of surface-
kernel epimorphisms from a co-compact Fuchsian group to a cyclic group. A formula for
the number of such epimorphisms is given in [18] but that formula does not seem to be very
applicable, especially for large values, because one needs to ﬁnd, as part of the formula, a
challenging summation involving the products of some Ramanujan sums and for each index
of summation one needs to calculate these products. The aim of this paper is to give a very
explicit and practical formula for the number of such epimorphisms. Our formula does not
contain Ramanujan sums or other challenging parts, and is really easy to work with. As a
consequence, we obtain an ‘equivalent’ form of the famous Harvey’s theorem on the cyclic
groups of automorphisms of compact Riemann surfaces.

In the next section, we review Fuchsian groups and Harvey’s theorem. Our main tool in
this paper is an explicit formula for the number of solutions of restricted linear congruence
recently proved by Bibak et al.
[2] using properties of Ramanujan sums and of the ﬁnite
Fourier transform of arithmetic functions, which is reviewed in Section 3. Our main result
is presented in Section 4.

2 Fuchsian groups and Harvey’s theorem

A Fuchsian group Γ is a ﬁnitely generated non-elementary discrete subgroup of PSL(2, R),
the group of orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane H2. Fuchsian groups
were ﬁrst studied by Poincar´e in 1882 in connection with the uniformization problem (later
the uniformization theorem), and he called the groups Fuchsian after Lazarus Fuchs whose
paper (1880) was a motivation for Poincar´e to introduce this concept. By a classical result
of Fricke and Klein (see, e.g., [24]), every such group Γ has a presentation in terms of
the generators a1, b1, . . . , ag, bg (hyperbolic), x1, . . . , xk (elliptic), y1, . . . , ys (parabolic), and
z1, . . . , zt (hyperbolic boundary elements) with the relations

1 = · · · = xnk
xn1

k = x1 · · · xky1 · · · ysz1 · · · zt[a1, b1] · · · [ag, bg] = 1,

(2.1)

where k, s, t, g ≥ 0, ni ≥ 2 (1 ≤ i ≤ k), and [a, b] = a−1b−1ab. The integers n1, . . . , nk are
called the periods of Γ, and g is called the orbit genus. The Fuchsian group Γ is determined,
up to isomorphism, by the tuple (g; n1, . . . , nk; s; t) which is referred to as the signature of
Γ. If k = 0 (i.e., there are no periods), Γ is called a Fuchsian surface group. If s = t = 0,
the group is called co-compact (or F-group, or proper). Some authors by a Fuchsian group
mean a co-compact Fuchsian group. In this paper, we only work with co-compact Fuchsian
groups.

We denotes by Hom(Γ, G) (resp., Epi(Γ, G)) the set of homomorphisms (resp., epimor-
phisms) from a Fuchsian group Γ to a ﬁnite group G. There is much interest (with many
applications) in combinatorics, geometry, algebra, and physics, in counting homomorphisms
and epimorphisms from a Fuchsian group to a ﬁnite group. For example, Liebeck and Shalev
[14, 15] obtained good estimates for |Hom(Γ, G)|, where Γ is an arbitrary Fuchsian group
and G is a symmetric group or an alternating group or a ﬁnite simple group.

An epimorphism from a Fuchsian group to a ﬁnite group with kernel a Fuchsian surface
group is called surface-kernel (or smooth). Harvey proved that an epimorphism φ from a
co-compact Fuchsian group Γ to a ﬁnite group G is surface-kernel if and only if it preserves
the periods of Γ, that is, for every elliptic generator xi (1 ≤ i ≤ k) of order ni, the order of
φ(xi) is precisely ni. The above-mentioned equivalence appears in Harvey’s inﬂuential 1966
paper [10] on the cyclic groups of automorphisms of compact Riemann surfaces. The main
result of this paper is the following theorem which gives necessary and suﬃcient conditions
for the existence of a surface-kernel epimorphism from a co-compact Fuchsian group to a
cyclic group.

Theorem 2.1. ([10]) Let Γ be a co-compact Fuchsian group with signature (g; n1, . . . , nk),
and let n := lcm(n1, . . . , nk). There is a surface-kernel epimorphism from Γ to Zn if and
only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) lcm(n1, . . . , ni−1, ni+1, . . . , nk) = n, for all i;
(ii) n | n, and if g = 0 then n = n;
(iii) k 6= 1, and, if g = 0 then k > 2;
(iv) if n is even then the number of periods ni such that n/ni is odd is also even.

By a result of Burnside [6], and of Greenberg [8], every ﬁnite group G acts as a group
of automorphisms of a compact Riemann surface of genus at least two. The minimum

3

genus problem asks to ﬁnd, for a given ﬁnite group G, the minimum genus of those compact
Riemann surfaces on which G acts faithfully as a group of conformal automorphisms. Harvey
[10], using Theorem 2.1, solved the minimum genus problem when G is the cyclic group Zn;
in fact, he gave an explicit value for the minimum genus in terms of the prime factorization
of n. Then, as a corollary, he obtained a famous result of Wiman [23] on the maximum
order for an automorphism of a compact Riemann surface of genus γ by showing that this
maximum order is 2(2γ + 1).

Harvey’s paper [10] played a pioneering role in studying groups of automorphisms of
compact Riemann surfaces and also has found important applications in some other areas of
mathematics like combinatorics. See, for example, the survey by Bujalance et al. [5] on the
“research inspired by Harvey’s theorem”, in which the authors describe many results about
the actions of several classes of groups, including cyclic, Abelian, solvable, dihedral, etc.,
along with the minimum genus and maximum order problems for these classes.

3 Ramanujan sums and restricted linear congruences

Throughout the paper we use gcd(a1, . . . , ak) and lcm(a1, . . . , ak) to denote, respectively,
the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of integers a1, . . . , ak. Also, for
a ∈ Z \ {0} and a prime p we use the notation pr k a if pr | a and pr+1 ∤ a. A function
f : Z → C is called periodic with period n (also called n-periodic or periodic modulo n)
if f (m + n) = f (m), for every m ∈ Z.
In this case f is determined by the ﬁnite vector
(f (1), . . . , f (n)).

Let e(x) = exp(2πix) be the complex exponential with period 1. For integers m and n

with n ≥ 1, the quantity

cn(m) =

n

Xj=1

(j,n)=1

e(cid:18) jm
n (cid:19)

(3.1)

is called a Ramanujan sum, which is also denoted by c(m, n) in the literature. From (3.1) it
is clear that cn(m) is a periodic function of m with period n.

Clearly, cn(0) = ϕ(n), where ϕ(n) is Euler’s totient function. Also, cn(1) = µ(n), where

µ(n) is the M¨obius function deﬁned by

µ(n) = 


1,
0,
(−1)κ,

if n = 1,
if n is not square-free,
if n is the product of κ distinct primes.

(3.2)

The classical version of the M¨obius inversion formula states that if f and g are arithmetic

functions satisfying g(n) = Pd | n f (d), for every integer n ≥ 1, then

f (n) =Xd | n

µ(cid:16)n
d(cid:17) g(d),

(3.3)

4

for every integer n ≥ 1.

Let a1, . . . , ak, b, n ∈ Z, n ≥ 1. A linear congruence in k unknowns x1, . . . , xk is of the

form

a1x1 + · · · + akxk ≡ b

(mod n).

(3.4)

By a solution of (3.4), we mean an ordered k-tuple x = hx1, . . . , xki ∈ Zk

n that satisﬁes (3.4).
The solutions of the above congruence may be subject to certain conditions, such as
gcd(xi, n) = ti (1 ≤ i ≤ k), where t1, . . . , tk are given positive divisors of n. The number of
solutions of these kinds of congruences, which were called restricted linear congruences in [2],
was ﬁrst considered by Rademacher [19] in 1925 and Brauer [4] in 1926, in the special case of
ai = ti = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k) (see Corollary 3.3 below). Since then, this problem has been studied,
in several other special cases, in many papers (for example, Cohen [7] dealt with the special
case of ti = 1, ai | n, ai prime, for all i) and has found very interesting applications in number
theory, combinatorics, computer science, and cryptography, among other areas; see [1, 2, 3]
for a detailed discussion about this problem and a comprehensive list of references. Recently,
Bibak et al.
[2] dealt with the problem in its ‘most general case’ and using properties of
Ramanujan sums and of the ﬁnite Fourier transform of arithmetic functions gave an explicit
formula for the number of solutions of the restricted linear congruence

a1x1 + · · · + akxk ≡ b

(mod n),

gcd(xi, n) = ti (1 ≤ i ≤ k),

(3.5)

where a1, t1, . . . , ak, tk, b, n (n ≥ 1) are arbitrary integers.

Theorem 3.1. ([2]) Let ai, ti, b, n ∈ Z, n ≥ 1, ti | n (1 ≤ i ≤ k). The number of solutions
of the linear congruence a1x1 + · · · + akxk ≡ b (mod n), with gcd(xi, n) = ti (1 ≤ i ≤ k), is

(3.7)

While Theorem 3.1 is useful from several aspects (for example, we use it in the proof
of Theorem 4.3), for many applications (for example, the ones considered in this paper) we
need a more explicit formula.

If in (3.5) one has ai = 0 for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k, then clearly there are solutions hx1, . . . , xki if
and only if b ≡ 0 (mod n) and ti | n (1 ≤ i ≤ k), and in this case there are ϕ(n/t1) · · · ϕ(n/tk)
solutions.

Consider the restricted linear congruence (3.5) and assume that there is an i0 such that
ai0 6= 0. For every prime divisor p of n let rp be the exponent of p in the prime factorization
of n and let mp = mp(a1, t1, . . . , ak, tk) denote the smallest j ≥ 1 such that there is some i

5

with pj ∤ aiti. There exists a ﬁnite mp for every p, since for a suﬃciently large j one has
pj ∤ ai0ti0. Furthermore, let

ep = ep(a1, t1, . . . , ak, tk) = #{i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k, pmp ∤ aiti}.

By deﬁnition, 1 ≤ ep ≤ the number of i such that ai
6= 0. Note that in many situa-
tions instead of mp(a1, t1, . . . , ak, tk) we write mp and instead of ep(a1, t1, . . . , ak, tk) we write
ep for short. However,
it is important to note that both mp and ep always depend on
a1, t1, . . . , ak, tk, p.

Theorem 3.2. ([2]) Let ai, ti, b, n ∈ Z, n ≥ 1, ti | n (1 ≤ i ≤ k) and assume that ai 6= 0
for at least one i. Consider the linear congruence a1x1 + · · · + akxk ≡ b (mod n), with
gcd(xi, n) = ti (1 ≤ i ≤ k). If there is a prime p | n such that mp ≤ rp and pmp−1 ∤ b or
mp ≥ rp + 1 and prp ∤ b, then the linear congruence has no solution. Otherwise, the number
of solutions is

(p − 1)ep(cid:19) ,

(3.8)

where the last two products are over the prime factors p of n with the given additional
properties. Note that the last product is empty and equal to 1 if b = 0.

Interestingly, if in Theorem 3.2 we put ai = ti = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k) then we get the following

result ﬁrst proved by Rademacher [19] in 1925 and Brauer [4] in 1926.

Corollary 3.3. Let b, n ∈ Z and n ≥ 1. The number of solutions of the linear congruence
x1 + · · · + xk ≡ b (mod n), with gcd(xi, n) = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is

ϕ(n)k

(p − 1)k−1(cid:19) Yp | n, p ∤ b

(cid:18)1 −

(−1)k

(p − 1)k(cid:19) .

(3.9)

Proof. Since ai = ti = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k), for any prime divisor p of n we have mp = 1 and
ep = k. So, for any prime divisor p of n we also have mp = 1 ≤ rp. Clearly, the ﬁrst part
of Theorem 3.2 does not hold in this special case, that is, there is no prime p | n such that
mp ≤ rp and pmp−1 ∤ b or mp ≥ rp + 1 and prp ∤ b. Furthermore, we have

Yp | n, p | b

prp Yp | n, p ∤ b

prp = n.

Thus, the result follows by a simple application of the second part of Theorem 3.2, (3.8).

We note that, while Theorem 3.2 may seem a bit complicated, it is in fact easy to work

with; see [2, Ex. 3.11] where we show, via several examples, how to apply Theorem 3.2.

Theorem 3.2 is the only result in the literature which gives necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for the (non-)existence of solutions of restricted linear congruences in their most

6

general case (see Corollary 3.4 below) and might lead to interesting applications/implications.
For example, see [3] for applications in computer science and cryptography, and [2] for
connections to the generalized knapsack problem proposed by Micciancio. In this paper, we
give more applications for this result.

Corollary 3.4. ([2]) The restricted congruence given in Theorem 3.2 has no solutions if and
only if one of the following cases holds:

(i) there is a prime p | n with mp ≤ rp and pmp−1 ∤ b;
(ii) there is a prime p | n with mp ≥ rp + 1 and prp ∤ b;
(iii) there is a prime p | n with mp ≤ rp, ep = 1 and pmp | b;
(iv) n is even, m2 ≤ r2, e2 is odd and 2m2 | b;
(v) n is even, m2 ≤ r2, e2 is even and 2m2−1 k b.

4 Counting surface-kernel epimorphisms from Γ to Zn

In this section, we obtain an explicit formula for the number of surface-kernel epimorphisms
from a co-compact Fuchsian group to a cyclic group. First, we need a formula that connects
the number of epimorphisms to the number of homomorphisms as, generally, enumerating
homomorphisms is easier than enumerating epimorphisms.

The M¨obius function and M¨obius inversion were studied for functions over locally ﬁnite
partially ordered sets (posets) ﬁrst by Weisner [22] and Hall [9], motivated by group theory
problems. Later, Rota [20] extended this idea and put it in the context of combinatorics.
Following the argument given in [9], we prove the following simple result.

Theorem 4.1. Let Λ be a ﬁnitely generated group. Then

|Epi(Λ, Zn)| =Xd | n

µ(cid:16)n
d(cid:17) |Hom(Λ, Zd)|,

(4.1)

where the summation is taken over all positive divisors d of n.

Proof. Clearly, for a ﬁnitely generated group Λ and a ﬁnite group G we have

|Hom(Λ, G)| =XH≤G

|Epi(Λ, H)|,

because every homomorphism from Λ to G induces a unique epimorphism from Λ to its
image in G.

Taking G = Zn, and since the cyclic group Zn has a unique subgroup Zd for every positive

divisor d of n and has no other subgroups, we get

|Hom(Λ, Zn)| =Xd | n

|Epi(Λ, Zd)|.

Now, by applying the M¨obius inversion formula, (3.3), the theorem follows.

7

We also need the following well-known result which gives equivalent deﬁning formulas for

Jordan’s totient function Jk(n) (see, e.g., [17, p. 13-14]).

Lemma 4.2. Let n, k be positive integers. Then

Jk(n) =Xd | n

d(cid:17) = nkYp | n

pk(cid:19) ,

(4.2)

where the left summation is taken over all positive divisors d of n, and the right product is
taken over all prime divisors p of n.

Now, using the above results, we obtain an explicit formula for the number |EpiS(Γ, Zn)|
of surface-kernel epimorphisms from the co-compact Fuchsian group Γ to the cyclic group
Zn.

Theorem 4.3. Let Γ be a co-compact Fuchsian group with signature (g; n1, . . . , nk), and let
n := lcm(n1, . . . , nk). If n ∤ n then there is no surface-kernel epimorphism from Γ to Zn.
Otherwise, the number of surface-kernel epimorphisms from Γ to Zn is

|EpiS(Γ, Zn)| = n2g

that there is some i with pj ∤ n

, and ep = #{i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k, pmp ∤ n/ni}.

Proof. By Theorem 4.1, we have

|EpiS(Γ, Zn)| =Xd | n

µ(cid:16)n
d(cid:17) |HomS(Γ, Zd)|,

(4.4)

where |HomS(Γ, Zd)| is the number of surface-kernel homomorphisms from Γ to Zd. It is
easy to see that for every positive divisor d of n we have |HomS(Γ, Zd)| = d2gNd, where Nd
is the number of solutions of the restricted linear congruence x1 + · · · + xk ≡ 0 (mod d),
with gcd(xi, d) = d
(1 ≤ i ≤ k). Suppose that D := {d > 0 : d | n and n | d}. Clearly,
ni
if D is empty then |HomS(Γ, Zd)| = 0, for every divisor d of n, which then implies that
|EpiS(Γ, Zn)| = 0, by (4.4). Let n ∤ n. Then n ∤ d, for every divisor d of n. Thus, D is
empty which then implies that |EpiS(Γ, Zn)| = 0, by (4.4). Now, let n | n. Then there exists
at least one divisor d of n such that n | d. So, D is non-empty. Now, for every d ∈ D, by
Theorem 3.2, we have

Nd =

that there is some i with pj ∤ d

Now, since the Ramanujan sum cn(m) is a periodic function of m with period n, it is easy
to see (from the above equivalent expressions) that the value of Nd will remain the same if
we replace d with n in (4.5). Consequently, we obtain the following explicit formula for the
number of surface-kernel homomorphisms from Γ to Zd,

, and ep = #{i : 1 ≤ i ≤ k, pmp ∤ n/ni}.

Remark 4.4. In the proof of Theorem 4.3 we have used only a special case of Theorem 3.2
where ai = 1 (1 ≤ i ≤ k) and b = 0. But there may be other generalizations/variants of
these or other groups so that for counting the number of surface-kernel epimorphisms (or
other relevant problems) we have to use the ‘full power’ of Theorem 3.2.

Remark 4.5. In order to get explicit values for |EpiS(Γ, Zn)| from Theorem 4.3, we only
need to ﬁnd the prime factorization of n, of n, and of the periods n1, . . . , nk. Then we can
easily compute rp, mp, ep, etc. In fact, even for Harvey’s theorem (Theorem 2.1) we need to
ﬁnd these prime factorizations! So, Theorem 4.3 has roughly the same computational cost
as Harvey’s theorem.

For a co-compact Fuchsian group with all periods equal to each other, we get the following

simpler formula from Theorem 4.3 and Corollary 3.3.

Otherwise, the number of surface-kernel epimorphisms from Γ to Zn is

Interestingly, using Theorem 4.3, we can obtain an ‘equivalent’ form of Harvey’s theorem

(Theorem 2.1). See also [16].

Corollary 4.7. Let Γ be a co-compact Fuchsian group with signature (g; n1, . . . , nk), and let
n := lcm(n1, . . . , nk). There is a surface-kernel epimorphism from Γ to Zn if and only if the
following conditions are satisﬁed:

(i) n | n;
(ii) if n > 1 then g > 0;
(iii) for every prime p | n with mp ≤ rp, we have ep > 1;
(iv) if n is even and m2 ≤ r2, then e2 is also even.

Proof. The proof simply follows by using the ﬁrst part of Theorem 4.3 and examining the
conditions under which the factors of the products in (4.3) do not vanish.

It is an interesting problem to develop these counting arguments for the classes of non-
cyclic groups. Such results would be very important from several aspects, for example, may
lead to more extensions of Harvey’s theorem and new proofs for the existing ones, and also
may provide us new ways for dealing with the minimum genus and maximum order problems
for these classes of groups. So, we pose the following question.

Problem 1. Give explicit formulas for the number of surface-kernel epimorphisms from a
co-compact Fuchsian group to a non-cyclic group, say, Abelian, solvable, dihedral, etc.
