PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS AND HOLONOMIES FOR

HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL MAPS

HEE OH AND DALE WINTER

Abstract. We discuss analogues of the prime number theorem for a
hyperbolic rational map f of degree at least two on the Riemann sphere.
More precisely, we provide counting estimates for the number of prim-
itive periodic orbits of f ordered by their multiplier, and also obtain
equidistribution of the associated holonomies; both estimates have power
savings error terms. Our counting and equidistribution results will fol-
low from a study of dynamical zeta functions that have been twisted
by characters of S1. We will show that these zeta functions are non-
vanishing on a half plane ℜ(s) > δ−ǫ, where δ is the Hausdorﬀ dimension
of the Julia set of f .

1. introduction

The prime number theorem states that the number of primes of size at
t
most t grows like
log t . It was proved by Hadamard and de la Valle´e Poussin
in 1896, and is equivalent to the non-vanishing of the Riemann zeta function
ζ(s) on the line ℜ(s) = 1.

Geometric analogues of this profound fact have been of great interest
over the years, and our aim in this work is to understand a reﬁned version
of the theorem for hyperbolic rational maps, providing both a power savings
error term and equidistribution of holonomies. These counting questions are
studied through their associated dynamical zeta functions, which in our case
must be twisted by characters of S1 to encode the holonomy information. We
establish that these zeta functions are non-vanishing (except for a necessary
pole at s = δ) on a half plane ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ for some ǫ > 0, where δ is the
Hausdorﬀ dimension of the Julia set of the rational map.

More precisely let f : ˆC → ˆC be a rational map on the Riemann sphere
and assume that f is hyperbolic, that is, the post critical orbit closure of
f is disjoint from the Julia set J. We seek to understand the dynamics of
iterates of f acting on ˆC.

For a primitive periodic orbit ˆx = {x, f x, f 2x, . . . , f n−1x} of period n,

the multiplier is given by

λ(ˆx) := (f n)′(x)

and the holonomy is given by

λθ(ˆx) :=

λ(ˆx)
|λ(ˆx)|

∈ S1.

Primitive periodic orbits naturally play the role of primes in our prime
number theorem, while the multiplier will be a measure of the size of the
periodic orbit (or “prime”).

We denote by P the set of all primitive periodic orbits of f . The hyper-
bolicity assumption implies that for a given t > 1, there are only ﬁnitely
many primitive periodic orbits of multiplier bounded by t, i.e,

Nt(P) := #{ˆx ∈ P : |λ(ˆx)| < t} < ∞.

We will prove the following estimate which both provides asymptotics for
Nt(P) and establishes equidistribution of their holonomies. As usual, we

write Li(t) =R t

log s .

Theorem 1.1. Let f : ˆC → ˆC be a hyperbolic rational map of degree at least
2.

(1) Suppose f is not conjugate to a monomial f (x) = x±d (by a M¨obius

transformation) for any d ∈ N. Then there exists ǫ > 0 such that

#{ˆx ∈ P : |λ(ˆx)| < t} = Li(tδ) + O(tδ−ǫ)

where 0 < δ < 2 is the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the Julia set of f .

(2) Suppose that the Julia set of f is not contained in any circle in ˆC.

Then there exists ǫ > 0 such that for any ψ ∈ C 4(S1),

Xˆx∈P:|λ(ˆx)|<t

ψ(λθ(ˆx)) =Z 1

0

ψ(e2πiθ) dθ · Li(tδ) + O(tδ−ǫ)

where the implied constant depends only on the Sobolev norm of ψ.

The special case of f (x) = x2 + c with c ∈ (−∞, −2) was studied by Naud
[10], who proved Theorem 1.1(1) in that setting. By conjugation, Naud’s
work covers all quadratic maps with Julia set contained in a circle.

We reduce the study of periodic orbits to the study of appropriate zeta
functions.
If x is a periodic point of period n, the multiplier λ(x) and
holonomy λθ(x) of x are deﬁned to be the multiplier and holonomy of the
orbit ˆx = {x, f (x), · · · , f n−1(x)} respectively. For each character χ of S1,
deﬁne the weighted dynamical zeta function twisted by χ:

(1.1)

(1 − χ(λθ(ˆx))|λ(ˆx)|−s)−1

ζ(s, χ) = Yˆx∈P

which is holomorphic and non-vanishing on ℜ(s) > δ. Note that this reduces
to the usual dynamical zeta function

(1.2)

(1 − |λ(ˆx)|−s)−1

ζ(s) = Yˆx∈P

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

when the character is trivial. The point is to establish a zero free half plane
beyond the critical line ℜ(s) = δ as follows.

Theorem 1.2. Let f be a hyperbolic rational map of degree at least 2.

(1) If f is not conjugate to x±d for any d ∈ N, then there exists ǫ > 0
such that ζ(s) is analytic and non-vanishing on ℜ(s) ≥ δ − ǫ except
for the simple pole at s = δ.

(2) If the Julia set of f is not contained in a circle, then there exists
ǫ > 0 such that for any non-trivial character χ of S1, ζ(s, χ) is
analytic and non-vanishing on ℜ(s) ≥ δ − ǫ.

1.1. On the proof of Theorem 1.1(2). We identify the group of all char-
acters of S1 with Z via the map χℓ(α) = αℓ. By the arguments of [9], The-
orem 1.1 follows from Theorem 1.2. Theorem 1.2 then follows from spectral
bounds for a family of Ruelle transfer operators

{Ls,ℓ : s ∈ C and ℓ ∈ Z}

which act on C 1(U ) for some neighbourhood U of the Julia set; see Theorem
2.7. These spectral bounds will be our main object of study.

Our approach is based on Dolgopyat’s ideas from his work on exponential
mixing of Anosov ﬂows [5]. A similar approach was carried through by
Pollicott-Sharp [9] for negatively curved compact manifolds, and by Naud
[10] for convex cocompact hyperbolic surfaces as well as for some class of
quadratic polynomials as remarked above.

In our setting of hyperbolic rational maps, the main technical diﬃculties

in implementing this approach arise from verifying the Non-Local-Integrability
(NLI) condition, the introduction of holonomy parameters, the fractal na-
ture of the Julia set, and understanding how all of these interact with the
intricate Dolgopyat machinery.

Here is a rough outline of our proof of the spectral bounds for Ls,ℓ.

(1) For a test function φ, the transfer operator (Ls,ℓφ)(x) is given as a

sum of complex valued summand functions (see subsection 2.3).

(2) Each of the summand functions has two sources of oscillation, coming
from b := ℑ(s) and ℓ respectively; using the Non-Local-Integrability
condition for f (see Section 3) we see that these two sources of
oscillation are complimentary rather than cancelling each other out,
so the summand functions are rapidly oscillating.

(3) When we add up our collection of rapidly oscillating summand func-
tions we expect to get cancellation, at least away from some smooth
curve where all the summand functions might line up perfectly.

(4) Since the Julia set J of a hyperbolic rational map does not concen-
trate near smooth curves (see the Non-Concentration-Property in
Section 4) it must meet the set where we have cancellation in the
sum.

(5) Since the sum deﬁning the transfer operator always experiences can-
cellation, its spectral radius must be smaller than expected; see Sec-
tion 5.

2. Hyperbolic rational maps and Ruelle operators

2.1. Iterates of rational maps. Let f : ˆC → ˆC be a rational map of
degree d at least two. Below we list some basic deﬁnitions and facts on
dynamics of the iterates of f . Useful references are [17], [4] and [16].

The domain of normality for the collection of iterates {f n : n = 1, 2, · · · }
is called the Fatou set for f , and its complement is called the Julia set, which
we will denoted by J = J(f ). The post critical set P = P (f ) means the
union of all forward images of the critical points of f .

A periodic orbit ˆx is called repelling, attracting or indiﬀerent according

as its multiplier satisﬁes |λ| > 1 or |λ| < 1 or |λ| = 1.

Throughout the paper, we assume f is hyperbolic, that is, f is eventually
expanding on the Julia set J in the sense that there are constants κ1 > κ > 1
such that

(2.1)

c0 · κn ≤ |(f n)′(x)| ≤ κn
1

for all x ∈ J and for all n ≥ 1. Equivalently, f is hyperbolic if the post
critical closure P is disjoint from the Julia set J, or if the orbit of every crit-
ical point converges to an attracting periodic orbit. Julia sets of hyperbolic
rational functions are known to have zero area. The Generic Hyperbolicity
Conjecture says that every rational map can be approximated arbitrarily
closely by a hyperbolic map.

Every periodic orbit of a hyperbolic map is either attracting or repelling
and there are at most 2d − 2 attracting periodic cycles [17, Coro. 10.16].
Repelling cycles, on the other hand, are dense in the Julia set. For this
reason we are interested exclusively in repelling cycles for the rest of the
paper.

We will say that two rational functions are conjuagate if they are conju-
gate by a holomorphic automorphism of ˆC, that is, an element of PSL2(C).

2.2. Markov partitions and symbolic dynamics for rational maps.
Replacing f by a conjugate we may assume that ∞ /∈ J. We will identify
ˆC − {∞} with C throughout.

It is well understood that hyperbolic rational maps can be studied by
means of symbolic dynamics. We now recall the essential features of this
approach, and refer to [12] for further details. For any small ǫ > 0, we can

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

ﬁnd a Markov partition P1, . . . , Pk0 for J, that is, Pi’s are compact subsets
of J of diameter at most ǫ such that

• J = ∪k0
• each Pi is the closure of its interior (relative to J), that is intJ Pj = Pj

j=1Pj,

for each j;

• the interiors are disjoint in the sense that intJ Pi ∩ intJ Pj = ∅ when-

ever i 6= j;

• for each j, the image f (Pj) is a union of partition elements Pi.

In fact, f (Pi) is given as the union of all Pj with intJ Pj ∩ f (Pi) 6= ∅. Fixing
a Markov parition P1 . . . Pk0 of a small diameter, we may also assume the
existence of open neighbourhoods Uj of Pj such that:

(1) the map f is injective on the closure of Uj for each j;
(2) f is injective on the union Ui ∪ Uj whenever Ui ∩ Uj 6= ∅;
(3) for every j, Pj is not contained in ∪k6=jUk;
(4) for every pair i, j with f (Pi) ⊃ Pj we have a local inverse gij : Uj →

Ui for f .

Associated to f we have the k0 × k0 transition matrix

Mij =(cid:26) 1 if f (Pi) ⊃ Pj,

0 else.

Note that M is topologically mixing, as f images of any open set meeting J
eventually cover J (see [17, Corollary 14.2]). Denote by Σ+ the shift space
of admissible sequences

Σ+ = {ω = (ω1, ω2, . . .) ∈ {1, . . . , k0}N : Mωk,ωk+1 = 1 for all k},

and by σ : Σ+ → Σ+ the shift map (σω)k = ωk+1. The relationship between
this symbolic space (Σ+, σ) and the complex dynamics of (J, f ) is described
by [12, Proposition 2.2]; there is a bounded to one surjective continuous map

Σ+ → J

given by

This map intertwines σ and f .

(ω1, ω2, . . .) 7→ ∩∞

1 f 1−kPωk .

Notation 2.1. For an admissible multi-index I = (ir, . . . i1) ∈ {1, . . . , k0}r
we write

gI := gir,ir−1 ◦ . . . ◦ gi2,i1 : Ui1 → Uir .

We record two elementary remarks about Markov partitions for later use.

Lemma 2.2. If f (x) = y and y is in the interior of some Pk, then x is in
the interior of some Pj.

Proof. Suppose that x ∈ Pj. Consider any sequence xℓ → x in Uj ∩ J. Then
f (xℓ) → y, so for some ℓ0, f (xℓ) ∈ Pk for all ℓ > ℓ0. As f (Pj) ⊃ Pk, there
exists zℓ ∈ Pj such that f (xℓ) = f (zℓ) for all ℓ > ℓ0. And since f is injective

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

on Uj we have that xℓ = zℓ ∈ Pj eventually. Therefore x is in the interior of
Pj.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.3. Suppose that we have two admissible sequences I, J of same
length m ≥ 2 and that i1 = j1 = j. If I 6= J then gI (Uj) ∩ gJ (Uj) = ∅.

Proof. We argue by induction on m. Suppose ﬁrst that m = 2. Choose a
point z in the interior of Pj. Note that gj2,j(z) and gi2,j(z) are in the interiors
of Pj2, Pi2 respectively. If they are equal, then we conclude Pj2 = Pi2 and
j2 = i2. If they are unequal, then we see that f is not injective on Uj2 ∪ Ui2,
and so that Uj2 ∩ Ui2 = ∅ by condition (2) on the Ui in Subsection 2.2. This
provides our base case.

Now suppose that we have the lemma for sequences of length m − 1.
Let I, J be sequences of length m ≥ 3 as above, and suppose that x ∈
gI (Uj) ∩ gJ (Uj). Then

f (x) ∈ gim−1,...,i2,j(Uj) ∩ gjm−1,...,j2,j(Uj) ⊂ Uim−1

hence (im−1, . . . , i2, j) = (jm−1, . . . , j2, j). Thus

x ∈ gjm,jm−1(Ujm−1) ∩ gim,jm−1(Ujm−1)

and so im = jm again by the inductive assumption. This completes the
proof.
(cid:3)

Associated to f , we have the distortion function

and a rotation

τ (z) = log |f ′(z)|

θ(z) = arg(f ′(z)) ∈ R/2πZ,

which are both deﬁned and analytic away from the critical set. We write

τN (z) :=

N −1

Xj=0

τ (f jz) and θN (z) :=

θ(f jz),

N −1

Xj=0

and denote α(z) = eiθ(z) and αN (z) = eiθN (z). Note that τ is eventually
positive on J, that is τN > 0 for some N .

We denote by δ = δ(f ) the unique positive zero of the pressure

P (−sτ ) := sup

{hf (ν) −Z sτ dν}

ν

where the supremum is taken over all f invariant probability measures on J
and hf (ν) is the measure-theoretic entropy of f .

There exists a unique f -invariant probability measure ν = ν−δτ on J,
called the equilibrium state of the potential −δτ , such that P (−δτ ) =

hf (ν) − δR τ dν = 0. The measure ν is equivalent to a δ dimensional Haus-

dorﬀ measure on J (see [2, 18]). It follows that δ is the Hausdorﬀ dimension
of the Julia set, and that 0 < δ < 2.

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Notation 2.4. We write U for the disjoint union of the Uj’s. Abusing
notation we regard τ and θ as functions on U . We regard ν as a measure

on U by taking ν = P νj where νj is the restriction of ν to the copy of Pj

sitting inside Uj. Since the boundary points of ν have zero mass this gives
a probability measure on U .

2.3. Ruelle transfer operators. Our main results will follow from spec-
tral estimates on twisted transfer operators, which we now introduce. We
write C 1(U ) for C 1(U, C). For a character χ : S1 → S1 and a complex
number s ∈ C, we consider the following transfer operators

Ls,χ : C 1(U ) → C 1(U )

(Ls,χh)(x)

:= Xi:Mij=1

e−sτ (gijx)χ(α(gij x))h(gij x) when x ∈ Uj.

We will sometimes write χℓ for the character χℓ(α) = αℓ, and

Ls,ℓ := Ls,χℓ.

We will denote Ls := Ls,0.

Our main technical result in this paper is the following:

Theorem 2.5.

(1) Suppose that f is not conjugate to a monomial. Then,
for any ǫ > 0, there exist Cǫ > 0, 0 < ǫ0 = ǫ0(ǫ) < 1 and 0 < ρǫ < 1
such that for all ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ0 and |ℑ(s)| > 1,

kLn

s kC1 ≤ Cǫ|ℑ(s)|1+ǫρn
ǫ .

(2) Suppose that the Julia set of f is not contained in a circle. Then,
for any ǫ > 0, there exist Cǫ > 0, 0 < ǫ0 = ǫ0(ǫ) < 1 and 0 < ρǫ < 1
such that for all ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ0 and |ℑ(s)| + |ℓ| > 1,

kLn

s,ℓkC1 ≤ Cǫ(|ℑ(s)| + |ℓ|)1+ǫρn
ǫ .

Notation 2.6. For a holomorphic function g : C → C we denote the deriv-
ative by g′ as usual.

Often we will have to deal with real valued functions instead, in which
case we denote the gradient of h : C = R2 → R by ∇h : C = R2 → R2. We
will denote the Euclidean norm in R2 by | · |.

Sometimes we will be driven to consider functions that are complex valued
but not necessarily holomorphic. For these we use the notation ∇h to mean
the Jacobian of h regarded as a map R2 → R2, and write |∇h| to mean the
operator norm of the matrix ∇h. We write ||h||C1(W ) for the supremum of
|∇h(u)| as u ranges over W .

In two instances we shall be forced to consider C 2 norms of a function h.
By this we simply mean the max of the C 1 norm and the supremum of X 2h
as X ranges over unit tangent vectors.

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

We deﬁne a modiﬁed C 1 norm on C 1(U ) by taking

(2.2)

||h||r :=(||h||∞ + ||∇h||∞

r

||h||∞ + ||∇h||∞ if 0 < r < 1.

if r ≥ 1

(The point of this is that the operators Ls,ℓ are uniformly bounded in
|| · |||b|+|ℓ| norm at least for large |b| + |ℓ|, whereas they are not uniformly
bounded in the usual C 1 norm.)

By the arguments of Ruelle, Theorem 2.5 is a consequence of the following

estimates (see [9] and [10, Section 5] for readable accounts).

Theorem 2.7.

(1) Suppose that f is not conjugate to a monomial. Then
there exist C > 0, ρ ∈ (0, 1) and ǫ0 > 0 such that for any h ∈ C 1(U )
and any n ∈ N,

(2.3)

||Ln

s h||L2(ν) ≤ Cρn||h|||ℑ(s)|

for all s ∈ C with ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ0 and |ℑ(s)| ≥ 1.

(2) Suppose that the Julia set of f is not contained in a circle. Then
there exist C > 0, ρ ∈ (0, 1) and ǫ0 > 0 such that for any h ∈ C 1(U )
and any n ∈ N,

(2.4)

||Ln

s,ℓh||L2(ν) ≤ Cρn||h||(|ℑ(s)|+|l|)

for all s ∈ C and ℓ ∈ Z with ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ0 and |ℑ(s)| + |ℓ| ≥ 1.

After preparations in Sections 3 and 4, the proof of Theorem 2.7 will be

completed in Section 5.

3. Non-Local-Integrability and hyperbolic rational maps

The goal of this section is to establish the Non-Local-Integrability con-
dition for hyperbolic rational maps which are not conjugate to monomials:
see Theorem 3.4. We begin with a precise formulation of the NLI condition.

3.1. The NLI condition. We retain the notation of subsection 2.2. Let
f be a hyperbolic rational map of degree d ≥ 2. Consider an admissible
sequence (. . . ξ−2, ξ−1, ξ0) with local inverses gξ−k,ξ−(k+1) : Uξ−k → Uξ−(k+1),
k ≥ 0. For any ﬁxed n ≥ 0, we have the section

gn
ξ := g(ξ−n,...,ξ−1,ξ0) : Uξ0 → Uξ−n

as a consequence of the eventual positivity of τ . On the other hand

ξ (x)) always diverges for any x ∈ Uξ0

of f n deﬁned on Uξ0. The sum P τn(gn
X1 (cid:0)τ (gn

τ∞(ξ, x, y) :=

ξ (x)) − τ (gn

ξ (y))(cid:1)

always converges for any pair x, y ∈ Uξ0, just using the contraction properties
of gn

ξ and the Lipschitz property of τ .

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

Deﬁnition 3.1 (Non-Local-Integrability). The function τ satisﬁes the NLI
property if there exist j ∈ {1, . . . , k0}, points x0, x1 ∈ Pj, and admissible
sequences (. . . ξ−2, ξ−1, j), (. . . ˆξ−2, ˆξ−1, j) with property that the gradient of

(3.2)

ˆτ (x) := τ∞(ξ, x, x0) − τ∞(ˆξ, x, x0)

is non-zero at x1; note if this holds for any single choice of x0 ∈ Pj, it must
hold for all choices of x0 ∈ Pj.

In fact it will be more convenient to use the following reformulation of

the NLI property.

Lemma 3.2 (Non-Local-Integrability II). Suppose that τ satisﬁes the NLI
property with respect to sequences ξ, ˆξ and the points x0, x1 ∈ Pj. Then there
exists an open neighbourhood U0 of x1 and constants δ2 ∈ (0, 1), N ∈ N such
that the following holds: for any n ≥ N , the map

(3.3)

(˜τ , ˜θ) := (τn ◦ gn

Proof. Deﬁne

(3.4)

θ∞(ξ, x, y) :=

θ(gn

ξ (x)) − θ(gn

ξ (y)) ∈ R/2πZ,

X1

which is again convergent on Uξ0 × Uξ0.

Since f is holomorphic we see that h := eˆτ +iˆθ is holomorphic. The NLI
property for τ implies then that the derivative of h is non-zero, and so that
h deﬁnes a local diﬀeomorphism from a neighbourhood of x1 to some open
subset of C. Since the derivatives of (3.3) converge locally uniformly and in
C 1 norm to log h, we are ﬁnished.
(cid:3)

We will also need the following observation later:

Proposition 3.3. If the Julia set J of f is contained in R, then

˜τ |U0∩R : U0 ∩ R → R

is a local diﬀeomorphism satisfying k˜τ |U0∩RkC2 < 1
2δ2
U0 ∩ R .

and |∇˜τ | > δ2 on

Proof. Since f preserves J ⊂ R, it also preserves R. Thus α := e2πiθ is
locally constant on R away from the critical set and takes values only in
{1, −1}. Hence θ is locally constant on R ∩ J. It follows that

∂
∂x

˜τ

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

10

is non-vanishing at some point of J; in the notation of Lemma 3.2, this
means that

˜τ : U0 ∩ R → R

is a local diﬀeomorphism with controlled C 2-norm as above.

(cid:3)

For a hyperbolic rational map conjugate to f (x) = x±d, τ is cohomologous
to a constant function on J, and hence does not have the NLI property. We
show that this is the only obstruction:
Theorem 3.4. For a a hyperbolic rational function f : ˆC → ˆC of degree at
least 2, the distortion function τ = log |f ′| on J satisﬁes the NLI property if
and only if f is not conjugate to f (x) = x±d for any d ∈ N.

Remark 3.5. In the above theorem, x1 can be chosen to be any point of
Pj with at most ﬁnitely many exceptions. This is because of the fact that
he collection of critical points for ˆτ is either discrete or everything, since ˆτ
is the real part of a holomorphic function. Thus if the NLI property holds
for some x1 in Pj it holds for almost every x1 in Pj.

The rest of this section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 3.4. Through-

out we assume that

f is not conjugate to x±d for any d ∈ N.

3.2. Inverse branches for f and universal covers. Recall that the hy-
perbolicity of f implies that the post critical closure P of f is equal to the
union of the countable set P of the forward orbits of critical points with the
ﬁnite set A of attracting critical points for f . Note also that P contains at
least three points; otherwise f is conjugate to a map x±d for some d ∈ N.
We write

Ω := ˆC − P

and note that Ω is a connected Riemann surface, admitting a hyperbolic
metric.

Let ˜Ω be the universal cover of Ω. We write ˜d for the hyperbolic metric

on ˜Ω, and π : ˜Ω → Ω for the covering map.
Deﬁnition We say that a holomorphic function ˜g : ˜Ω → ˜Ω is an inverse
branch for f if

f (π(˜g(z))) = π(z)

(3.5)
Lemma 3.6. For any pair ˜z1, ˜z2 ∈ ˜Ω with the property f (π(z1)) = π(z2)
there exists a unique inverse branch ˜g of f with ˜g(˜z2) = ˜z1. The image of
any inverse branch is ˜Ω − π−1(f −1(P )).

for all z ∈ ˜Ω.

Proof. We note that the maps

f : Ω − f −1(P ) → Ω

and

π : ˜Ω − π−1(f −1(P )) → Ω − f −1(P )

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

11

are covering maps. It follows that their composition is also a covering map,
and the lemma follows by universality of π : ˜Ω → Ω.
(cid:3)

If ˜g is an inverse branch for f , then it is a strict contraction for the
hyperbolic metric ˜d and has a unique ﬁxed point ˜β in ˜Ω by [17, Theorem
5.2]. Note that the projection π( ˜β) of a ﬁxed point of an inverse branch is
necessarily a ﬁxed point of f .

3.3. Normalized distortion functions and the π1 action. For inverse
branches ˜g0, ˜g1 of f with ﬁxed points ˜βi and βi := π( ˜βi), we form normalized
distortion functions ˜h0, ˜h1 on ˜Ω as follows:

˜hj(z) :=

.

This is the moment at which NLI comes into play.
Lemma 3.7. Suppose that NLI fails. Then ˜h0 satisﬁes both of these func-
tional equations:

(3.7)

˜h0(z)

˜h0(˜gj(z))

=

f ′(π(˜gj z))

λ(βj)

for j = 0, 1.

Proof. It suﬃces to show that the ratio H(z) := ˜h0(z)/˜h1(z) is constant on
˜Ω. We work with the contrapositive. Assume H(z) is non-constant. As H is
holomorphic and J is a perfect set, it follows that there exists a point, say z0,
in the cover π−1(J) where H ′(z0) 6= 0. It will be convenient to renormalize
once more and choose

ˆH(z) :=

H(z)˜h1(z0)

.

˜h0(z0)

Note that ˆH ′(z0) 6= 0, too.

Without loss of generality we may assume that π(z0) is in the interior
of some element Pi of the Markov partition. Now the sequence π(˜gk
0 z0) is
a sequence of pre-images for π(z0) under f and lands in the interior of a
partition element Pξ−k . Similarly we choose ˆξ such that π(˜gk
1 z0) ∈ Pˆξ−k
.
Unwrapping the deﬁnitions we have that

(3.8)

(3.9)

ˆH(z) = exp(τ∞(ξ, π(z), β0) − τ∞(ˆξ, π(z), β1))

× exp(2πiθ∞(ξ, π(z), β0) − 2πiθ∞(ˆξ, π(z), β1)).

The left hand side of this equation is a holomorphic function with non-zero
derivative at z = z0, and hence automatically a local diﬀeomorphism of a
small neighbourhood of z0 into a small neighbourhood of it’s image 1 ∈ C.

This contradicts the assumption that NLI fails and hence completes the
proof.
(cid:3)

Fix an inverse branch ˜g0 for f and write ˜h0, ˜β0, β0 for the associated
normalized distortion function, ﬁxed point in ˜Ω and projected ﬁxed point
in Ω respectively. The fundamental group π1(Ω) has a tautological action
on the universal cover ˜Ω; this extends to an action on the set of inverse
branches for f by choosing

(α · ˜g)(z) := α(˜g(z)).

Proposition 3.8. Suppose that N LI fails. Then

(1) |˜h0| is invariant for the π1(Ω)-action on π−1(J);
(2) If |h0| denotes the projection of |˜h0| to J, then

|h0(x)||f ′(x)|

|h0(f (x))|

= d1/δ

for all x ∈ J.

That is, τ is cohomologous to the constant function log d1/δ on J.

Proof. Let α ∈ π1(Ω). We denote the ﬁxed point of α · ˜g0 by ˜β(α) and write
β(α) := π( ˜β(α)). By considering the functional equations (3.6) for ˜g0 and
α · ˜g0 we deduce from Lemma 3.7 that for all z ∈ ˜Ω,

(3.10)

˜h0(α˜g0(z))
˜h0(˜g0(z))

=

λ(β(α))
λ(β0)

.

We claim now that |˜h0| is invariant for the π1(Ω) action on ˜Ω; if not then
> 1. By Lemma

we may choose α ∈ π1(Ω) and z ∈ ˜Ω such that (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

3.6, ˜g0 is surjective, and hence we can choose zj ∈ ˆΩ such that

˜h0(˜g0(z)) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˜h0(α˜g0(z))

˜g0(zj) = αj−1˜g0(z).

But then for any k ≥ 1,

The ﬁnal terms here clearly converges to ∞ with k → ∞, but the collec-
tion of ﬁxed points for f is ﬁnite, so there are ﬁnitely many multipliers to
choose from for λ(β(αk)); this is contradiction, proving the claim (1).

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

To prove (2), choose x ∈ J and set y = f x. Choose lifts ˜x, ˜y of x, y to
π−1(J) and an inverse branch ˜g of f such that ˜g(˜y) = ˜x. Let ˜β be the ﬁxed
point of ˜g and β := π( ˜β). Then

|f ′(x)| = |f ′(π(˜g(˜y))|
|λ(β)||˜h0(˜y)|

|˜h0(˜g ˜y)|

|λ(β)||˜h0(˜y)|

|˜h0(˜x)|

|h0(x)|

by (3.6)

by (1)

=

=

=

=

|λ(β)||h0(f (x))|

|h0(x)|

.

In other words, for any x ∈ J,

|λ(β)| =

|h0(x)||f ′(x)|

|h0(f (x))|

.

Therefore

log |f ′(x)| = log |h0(f (x))| − log |h0(x)| + log |λ(β)|,

that is, τ = log |f ′| is cohomologous to the constant log |λ(β)|. Since the
equilibrium state ν for −δτ must be the measure of maximal entropy for f ,
and the topological entropy of f is given as the logarithm of the degree of
f , it follows that log |λ(β)| = log d1/δ. This ﬁnishes the proof.
(cid:3)

We now recall work of Zdunik [19, Corollary in section 7 and Proposition

8].

Theorem 3.9. Suppose that f is hyperbolic and δτ is cohomologous to log d.
Then f is conjugate to the map x±d.

Proof of Theorem 3.4. Suppose f is a hyperbolic rational function with de-
gree at least 2 and not conjugate to z±d. If NLI fails then Proposition 3.8
shows that δτ is cohomologous (on J) to log d; however this is impossible
by Zdunik’s result.
(cid:3)

4. Non-Concentration and doubling for hyperbolic Julia sets

4.1. Non-concentration. As before, let f be a hyperbolic rational map of
degree d ≥ 2, and keep the notation from Section 2.2. In this section we
shall address non-concentration properties for hyperbolic Julia sets. We will
also recall that the associated measures have the doubling property on each
cylinder.

Notation 4.1. We write cylinders of length r ∈ N as

(4.1)

C([i1, . . . , ir]) := {x ∈ J : f j−1x ∈ Pij for 1 ≤ j ≤ r}.

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

14

Note that we can regard cylinders either as subsets of J or as subsets of

Pi1 ⊂ Ui1 ⊂ U .

Let J denote the Julia set of f .

Deﬁnition 4.2 (The Non-Concentration Property). The Julia set J has
the Non-Concentration Property (NCP) if, for each cylinder C of J, there
exists 0 < δ1 < 1 such that, for all x ∈ C, all w ∈ C of unit length, and all
ǫ ∈ (0, 1) ,

(4.2)

Bǫ(x) ∩ {y ∈ C : |hy − x, wi| > δ1ǫ} 6= ∅

where ha + bi, c + dii = ac + bd for a, b, c, d ∈ R.

It is clear that the NCP must fail whenever J is contained in a circle, in

which case we refer to Theorem 4.3(2) for the required modiﬁcation.

The NCP is a consequence of quasi-self-similarity of the Julia set: in some
precise sense J looks the same at every length scale. We will describe the
required aspects of this notion as they appear.

We start by choosing some constants to be used for the rest of the section.
For each partition element Pj ⊂ Uj, choose a neighbourhood Pj ⊂ Ωj ⊂ Uj
with Ωj ⊂ Uj. Note that we can ﬁnd positive integers K1, K2, K3, K4, L
such that

(1) for any x ∈ J and any ǫ ∈ (0, 1), there exists k ∈ N with

1

K1ǫ

≤ |(f k)′(x)| ≤

;

(2) for any j and any x ∈ Pj, we have B3/K2(x) ⊂ Ωj;
(3) for any j and any x ∈ Ωj, we have B3/K2(x) ⊂ Uj;
(4) for any admissible sequence I = (i1, . . . , ir) and associated map gI :

Uir → Ui1, we have
I (x)|
I (y)|

|g′
|g′

≤ K3

for all x, y ∈ Ωir ;

(5) for any x ∈ Ωj, any r ∈ (0, 1/K2), and any univalent map T : Uj →

C, we have that

B|T ′(x)|r/K4(T (x)) ⊂ T (Br(x)) ⊂ B|T ′(x)|rK4(T (x));
1

(6) every cylinder of length L has diameter less than

2K1K2K3K 2
4

.

The statement (1) follows from the hyperbolicity of f , and the statements (4)
and (5) follow from Koebe’s Distortion theorem (cf. [4]). Other statements
are clear.

Theorem 4.3 (NCP).

(1) If J is not contained in a circle, then the

NCP holds for J.

(2) If J is contained in R, then for each cylinder C of J, there exists

0 < δ1 < 1 such that, for all x ∈ C, and all ǫ > 0,

Bǫ(x) ∩ {y ∈ C : |y − x| > δ1ǫ} 6= ∅.

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

15

Proof. We address part (1) ﬁrst. Suppose that J is not contained in a circle.
Fix now some cylinder C = C([i1, . . . , ir]) of length r and we assert that the
outcome of NCP holds for C. If not, we may choose xn ∈ C, ǫn → 0 and
wn ∈ C of modulus one with which the NCP property fails , that is

1
ǫn

hyn, −xn, wni → 0

for any sequence yn ∈ Bǫn(xn) ∩ C. Without loss of generality, we assume
that ǫn ∈ (0, 1). Choose kn ∈ N such that
. We
may also assume that kn > r + 1.

≤ |(f kn)′(xn)| ≤ 1
ǫn

K1ǫn

1

Let C(In) = C([in

1 , . . . , in
kn

]) be a length kn-subcylinder of C containing

xn, and set yn = f kn−1(xn) ∈ Pikn . We renormalize via the map

φn : Bǫn(xn) → B1(0),

y 7→

y − xn

ǫn

.

Now choose a subcylinder Dn of length L in Pikn containing yn. We then
have that gIn maps yn ∈ Dn ⊂ B1/(K1K2K4)(yn) to xn ∈ C ∩ Bǫn/K2(xn)
which then maps via φn to B1(0).

We now consider the composition

φn ◦ gIn : B1/(K1K2K4)(yn) → B1(0).

Note that the derivative of φn ◦ gIn at yn is bounded both above and below
independent of n. Now, by passing to a subsequence, we may assume that
Dn is constant independent of n, that yn converges to some y∞ ∈ Dn, that
wn converges to some w∞ ∈ S1 and that φn ◦ gIn converges locally uniformly
to a non-constant univalent function

g∞ : B1/(2K1K2K4)(y∞) → B1(0).

We see that the non-empty open subset Dn ∩ B1/(2K1K2K4)(y∞) is con-
tained in the smooth curve g−1
∞ (L∞ ∩ Image(g∞)) where L∞ is the perpen-
dicular line to w∞. But then for some N ≥ 1, f N (Dn ∩ B1/(2K1K2K4)(y∞))
contains J [17, Corollary 14.2]. Therefore J is contained in a smooth curve.
Work of Eremenko-Von Strien [14] implies that J must then be contained
in a circle.

Now address part (2). Now suppose J is contained in the real line. Then
the above argument shows that the failure of (2) implies that x is an isolated
point in J, which is a contradiction as J is a perfect set.
(cid:3)

4.2. Doubling of the conformal measure on cylinders. Recall the
equilibrium measure ν on J and its restriction νj to Pj for each j from
(2.4). The doubling property for ν itself is a straightforward consequence of
the fact that for all small ǫ > 0, ν(Bǫ(x)) is equivalent to ǫδ up to bounded
constants [18]. It is however important for later arguments that the mea-
sures νj also have the doubling property.

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

16

Proposition 4.4 (Doubling). For each j, the measure νj has the doubling
property. That is, there exists C > 1 (called the doubling constant) such that
for any x ∈ Pj and any ǫ > 0:
(4.3)

νj(B2ǫ(x)) ≤ C · νj(Bǫ(x)).

It does not seem clear a priori that the doubling property of ν descends
to the restrictions νj. For this reason we provide an argument which, again,
is based on quasi self similarity of the Julia set. Proposition 4.4 follows from
the following:

Proposition 4.5. There is a constant c > 0 with the following property.
For any j, any x ∈ Pj and any ǫ > 0, we have

ν(Bǫ(x) ∩ Pj)

ν(Bǫ(x))

> c

In particular, each νj inherits the doubling property from ν itself.

Proof. We retain our choices of constants K1, K2, K3, K4, and L. Fix 1 ≤
j ≤ k0, x ∈ Pj and ǫ > 0. We choose k = k(x, ǫ) such that

1

2K1K2K3K4ǫ

≤ |(f k)′(x)| ≤

1

2K2K3K4ǫ

.

We claim that this k satisﬁes a Goldilocks property: it is neither too large
nor too small.
Claim 1: k is not too large in the sense that
Bǫ(x) ⊂ gI (Ωik+1)

for every length k + 1 cylinder C(I) = C([i1, . . . , ik+1]) meeting Bǫ(x). In
particular f k is injective on Bǫ(x).

This follows from the following calculation: suppose y ∈ C(I) ∩ Bǫ(x),

and let ˆy = f ky ∈ Pik+1, then

gI (Ωk+1) ⊃ gI (B3/K2(ˆy))

I (ˆy)|/(K2K4)(y)

⊃ B|g′
⊃ B1/(K2K4|(f k)′(y)|)(y)
⊃ B1/(K2K3K4|(f k)′(x)|)(y)
⊃ B2ǫ(y)
⊃ Bǫ(x).

The fourth inclusion here requires some comment: we want to use condition
(4), that is

|g′

I (f ky)/g′

I (f kx)| < K3;

this only makes sense if C(I) contains x. To get around this we ﬁrst run
the argument for y′ = x contained in some cylinder C(J) and so obtain
Bǫ(x) ⊂ gJ (Ωjk+1). For any y ∈ Bǫ(x) we then have that

|(f k)′(x)/(f k)′(y)| = |g′

J (f ky)/g′

J (f kx)| < K3,

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

17

as required.
Claim 2: k is not too small in that sense that any subcylinder C(I) of Pj
of length k + L that contains x is contained in Bǫ(x).

For the proof, suppose I = (i1, . . . , ik+L). Note that f k(C(I)) is a length
L cylinder, so has small diameter by the choice of L, and the statement
follows by applying condition (5) to gI ′ where I ′ = (i1, . . . , ik+1).
Claim 3: If r is the number of length k cylinders meeting Bǫ(x), then
r ≤ k0, the number of elements in our Markov partition

Let I1, . . . , Ir be the length k cylinders meeting Bǫ(x). The claim follows
from the pigeonhole principle, injectivity of f k on Bǫ(x), and injectivity of
f k on each set gIj (ΩIj k+1
If r > k0 then we may assume without loss
of generality that f k−1(C(I1)) = f k−1(C(I2)) both give the same parti-
tion element. Choose y ∈ Bǫ(x) to be an interior point for C(I1). Then
f k−1(y) ∈ f k−1(C(I1)). But it is then an easy exercise in injectivity to see
that f k−1(y) /∈ f k−1(C(I2)) . This gives the required contradiction.

We are now ready to prove our Proposition . Let C(I) be a length k + L

subcylinder of Pj contained in Bǫ(x). Then

5. Spectral bounds for transfer operators

In the entire section, we assume that f is a hyperbolic rational function
of degree at least 2 and that f is not conjugate to x±d for any d ∈ N. Our
goal in this section is to prove Theorem 2.7.
Spectral bounds for the transfer operators

(Ls,ℓh)(x)

:= Xi:Mij=1

e−sτ (gij x)χℓ(α(gij x))h(gij x),

s ∈ C, ℓ ∈ Z

on C 1(U ) will follow from the oscillatory nature of the summand terms. The
role of the NLI condition is to ensure that the summand terms are rapidly
oscillating (relative to one another). This ensures that we will see some
cancellation in the summation for (Ls,ℓh)(x) at least for many x ∈ U . We
then need to ensure that some of this cancellation happens on the Julia set;
that follows from the NCP, which says that the Julia set is ’too big’ to avoid

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

18

the cancellation. Finally this cancellation on the Julia set must be used to
prove spectral bounds for ˆL; that is the topic of this section.

Our task for this section is to make the heuristic above precise.

5.1. Setup for the construction of Dolgopyat operators. The aim of
this subsection is to establish notation and to recall some standard results
that will be needed to prove Theorem 2.7. We retain the notation of the
previous sections.

By the NLI property of τ shown in Theorem 3.4 and Remark 3.5, we may
choose constants as in Lemma 3.2; in other words we ﬁx a partition element
Pj, points x0, x1 ∈ Pj, admissible sequences ξ, ˆξ, a neighbourhood U0 of
x1, and δ2 > 0 satisfying the conditions of that Lemma. As a notational
convenience we shall assume that the x1, U0 described above satisfy that U0
is an open disc,

x1 ∈ P1 and U0 ⊂ U1 with U0 ∩ Uk = ∅ for all k 6= 1.

It will be convenient to normalize our transfer operators. Ruelle showed
in [12, Theorem 3.6] that Lδ,0 has leading eigenvalue 1 with associated pos-
itive C 1 eigenfunction hδ. We choose to work with the normalised transfer
operator

(5.1)

( ˆLs,ℓh)(x)

:=

Ls,ℓ(h · hδ)

hδ

.

The convenience of this setup is that we get to assume ˆLδ,01 = 1. We note
that it suﬃces to prove Theorem 2.7 for the operators ˆLs,ℓ. When χ = 0 is
the trivial character, we sometimes write ˆLs for ˆLs,0.

Our next task is to ﬁx a large number of parameters which will be needed
throughout the rest of the argument. Though some of these parameters
will not appear in our proofs for a good while yet, it is not an arbitrary
choice to ﬁx them now; almost the entire technical diﬃculty of this proof
is to understand how to ﬁx coherent choices of these parameters, and to
understand that they can be chosen independent of the variables s, ℓ that
we are studying.

All constants we choose below are positive real numbers. Recall the ex-

pansion constants 1 < κ < κ1 and c0 from (2.1).

Without loss of generality we assume that κ < 2. Choose now n1 ∈ N
and, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k0, a length n1 + 1 cylinder Xi contained in U0 such
that

f n1Xi = Pi.

Let δ1 ∈ (0, 1) be a constant with respect to which the cylinders X1, . . . , Xk0
satisfy the NCP as in Deﬁnition 4.2 and Theorem 4.3. Denote the minimal
doubling constant for any νj by C3 > 1 given by Proposition 4.4.

of the way we now proceed to construct our Dolgopyat operators. Through-
out this section, we ﬁx a complex number s = a + ib and a character χℓ with
ℓ ∈ Z. We assume that

|a − δ| < a0

and

|b| + |ℓ| ≥ 1,

and write ˜ǫ = ǫ1/(|b| + |ℓ|).

In order to prove Theorem 2.7, there are two cases depending on whether

by conjugation with a fractional linear transformation, which does not eﬀect
holonomies or periods), and will specialize to the case ℓ = 0 for the entire
remaining argument and hence prove Theorem 2.7 for ℓ = 0. When J is not
contained in any circle, we deal with an arbitrary integer ℓ as required in
Theorem 2.7.

Fullness implies that the set of xk

r ’s indicated by Λ forms a 100˜ǫ

net for Xk.

Deﬁnition 5.5. Set N := N0+n1. For each Λ ∈ F, we deﬁne the Dolgopyat
operator MΛ,a on C 1(U ) by

MΛ,ah := ˆLN

a,0(hβΛ).

5.4. Properties of the Dolgopyat operators. Our next task is to estab-
lish two key properties of the Dolgopyat operators.

Theorem 5.6. Fix Λ ∈ F. If H ∈ KE(|b|+|ℓ|)(U ), then

(1) MΛ,aH ∈ KE(|b|+|ℓ|)(U ) and
(2) ||MΛ,aH||L2(ν) ≤ (1 − ǫ2)||H||L2(ν).

Proof. Suppose that H ∈ KE(|ℓ|+|b|)(U ). Then direct calculation yields that

By our choice of η, we therefore have βΛH ∈ K2(E+1)(|b|+|ℓ|)(U ).
In con-
junction with Lemma 5.1 and the deﬁnition of the Dolgopyat operator, this
yields that for all u ∈ U ,

(5.10)

|∇MΛ,aH(u)| ≤ A0(cid:18)1 +

2(E + 1)(|b| + |ℓ|)

(cid:19) |MΛ,aH(u)|.

Our choices of N and E now yield

(5.11)

as desired in (1).

MΛ,aH ∈ KE(|b|+|ℓ|)(U )

We now address part (2). We work ﬁrst with the case that a = δ, and

then use continuity in a to conclude the result; details are below.

A direct calculation in Cauchy Schwartz gives
δ (HβΛ))2 ≤ ( ˆLN

We are therefore interested in ﬁnding a large subset of U where ˆLN

union of

{xk

r ∈ Xk : vj(xk

and

{yk

r ∈ Xk : vj(yk

r ) ∈ Λ for some j = 1, 2}.

Recall that f n1Xk = Pk. Write Sk = f n1 ˜Sk ⊂ Pk. Consider the following

doubling properties of the measure νj (Theorem 4.5) to bound the integral

5.5. The iterative argument. Our ﬁnal technical challenge is to relate
the Dolgopyat operator to the twisted transfer operators in preparation for
an iterative argument.

Theorem 5.7. There exists a0 > 0 such that for all |δ − a| < a0, we have
the following: for every h ∈ C 1(U ) and H ∈ KE(|ℓ|+|b|)(U ) satisfying

|h| ≤ H and |∇h| ≤ E(|ℓ| + |b|)H pointwise on U ,

there is a choice of Λ ∈ F such that

(5.18)

and

(5.19)

| ˆLN

s,ℓh| ≤ MΛ,aH

|∇( ˆLN

s,ℓh)| ≤ E(|ℓ| + |b|)MΛ,aH

both hold pointwise on U (here s = a + ib).

The second part, (5.19) is a direct calculation using the Lasota-Yorke
bounds (Lemma 5.1). We now address the ﬁrst part. The actual procedure
is to make a clever choice of Λ such that
a+ib,ℓh| ≤ ˆLN0

a (βΛH)

(5.20)

| ˆLN0

pointwise. Once we do this, it will be easy to deduce (5.18) by applying ˆLn1
a
to both sides, recalling N = N0 + n1. The next Lemma will guide us in
that choice. Recall the sections v1, v2 of f N0 chosen in (5.2).

Lemma 5.8. Deﬁne ∆1 and ∆2 on U0 as follows:
(5.21)

−(δ+s)τN0

(vk (x))+iℓθN0

(vk (x))

−(δ+a)τN0

(v1(x))

H(v1(x))hδ (v1(x))+e

−(δ+a)τN0

e

H(v1(x))hδ (v1(x))+(1−k0η)e

H(v2(x))hδ (v2(x))
For each (r, k) ∈ {1, . . . , r0} × {1, . . . , k0}, at least one of ∆1, ∆2 is less than
or equal to one on at least one of the discs B2˜ǫδ3(xk
Proof. Fix (r, k) ∈ {1, . . . , r0} × {1, . . . , k0}, and consider the alternative
described in Lemma 5.3 for the sections v1, v2. If the ﬁrst alternative holds
on B10˜ǫ(xk
r ) for either v1 or v2, then we are ﬁnished, so we shall assume the
converse. For x ∈ B10˜ǫ(xk
r ), we write Arg(x) for the argument (taking values
in [−π, π) of the ratio of the summands in the numerator of ∆j:

r ) or B2˜ǫδ3(yk

r ).

with s = a + ib. Our aim is to exclude the possibility that Arg(x) is small
both near xk
r ; that will imply some cancellation in the numerator
and give the lemma.

Remark A priori one might worry that the arg(x) function has discontinu-
ities where it jumps from −π to π. However, a straightforward calculation
using the Lipschitz bound (5.27) and the small diameter of B10˜ǫ(xk
r ) estab-
lishes that the required bound (5.28) follows immediately if |Arg(x)| > π
2
anywhere on B10˜ǫ(xk

r ).

We therefore assume that |Arg(x)| ≤ π/2 on that ball, and that the arg func-
tion is correspondingly continuous. Recall the functions ˜τ , ˜θ from Lemma
3.2 and calculate

(5.24)

Arg(x) = b˜τ (x) + ℓ˜θ(x) + arg(cid:18) h(v1(x))
h(v2(x))(cid:19)

= b˜τ (x) + ℓ˜θ(x) + arg(h(v1(x))) − arg(h(v2(x)))

(5.25)
where we think of these numbers as elements of S1 = R/2πZ where neces-
sary. Direct calculation yields

(5.26)

|∇ arg(h(vj (x)))| ≤

4E(|b| + |ℓ|)

c0κN0

for j = 1, 2.

Applying Taylor’s expansion to the map y 7→ b˜τ (y) + ℓ˜θ(y) at xk
using the condition k(˜τ , ˜θ)kC2 ≤ 1/(2δ2) by the NLI condition, we get

where we used the NCP condition (5.8) for the third inequality.

The next step is to show that |Arg(y) − Arg(x)| > δ1δ2ǫ1 for every x ∈

B2δ3˜ǫ(xk

r ) and y ∈ B2δ3˜ǫ(yk

r ). First estimate the C 1 norm of Arg(x):

(5.27)

|∇Arg(x)| ≤ A0(|b| + |ℓ|) +

8E(|b| + |ℓ|)

c0κN0

≤ E(|b| + |ℓ|).

PRIME NUMBER THEOREMS FOR HYPERBOLIC RATIONAL FUNCTIONS

27

This gives

|Arg(xk

.

A similar calculation shows |Arg(yk
for every x ∈ B2δ3˜ǫ(xk

r ) and y ∈ B2δ3˜ǫ(yk

r ), we have

|Arg(y) − Arg(x)|
r ) − Arg(xk

> |Arg(yk
≥ δ1δ2ǫ1

r )| − |Arg(y) − Arg(yk

r )| − |Arg(x) − Arg(xk

r )|

as expected. We now claim that one of the following holds:

(1) Arg(x) > δ1δ2ǫ1
(2) Arg(y) > δ1δ2ǫ1
To see this, suppose that the ﬁrst statement fails; but then we may choose

on B2δ3˜ǫ(xk
r ) or
on B2δ3˜ǫ(yk
r ).

x ∈ B2δ3˜ǫ(xk

has
|e−(δ+a)τN0 (v2(x))h(v2(x))hδ(v2(x))| ≤ |e−(δ+a)τN0 (v1(x))h(v1(x))hδ(v1(x))|,
and that

where η′ := (1 − 4k0η). Now we notice that the logarithmic derivative of

therefore obtain a full set Λ ∈ F. The inequality (5.20) then follows from

Proof of Theorem 2.7. The deduction of Theorem 2.7 from Theorems 5.6
and 5.7 is now standard as in [10, Section 5]. For completeness we recall the
argument. Fix a, b ∈ R and ℓ ∈ Z with |a − δ| < a0 as in Theorem 5.7 and
|b| + |ℓ| > 1. Let h ∈ C 1(U ) .

Using Theorems 5.6 and 5.7 we inductively choose functions

Hk ∈ KE(|b|+|ℓ|)(U ) ⊂ C 1(U, R)

with the properties:

(1) H0 is the constant function ||h||(|b|+|ℓ|),
(2) Hk+1 = MΛk,aHk for some Λk ∈ F,
(3) | ˆLkN
(4) |∇ ˆLkN

s,ℓ h| ≤ Hk pointwise, and

s,ℓ h| ≤ E(|b| + |ℓ|)Hk pointwise.

From this it follows by Theorem 5.6 that

|| ˆLkN

s,ℓ h||L2(ν) ≤ (1 − ǫ2)k||h||(|b|+|ℓ|)

for any h ∈ C 1(U ) and any k ≥ 0. For general n = kN +r with 0 ≤ r ≤ N −1,

6. L-functions, transfer operators and counting estimates for

hyperbolic polynomials

In this section we describe the relationship between transfer operators
and zeta functions. This relationship, together with the bounds we have
established, will allow us to deduce our main equidistribution theorem. The
approach described in this section is well established; the interested reader
can ﬁnd a clear account in [9]. We include an outline of the argument for
the convenience of readers.

We recall the shift space Σ+ from Section 2 together with its shift operator

σ. We have a map π : Σ+ → J given by

x = (i0, i1, i2, · · · ) 7→ ∩∞

j=0f −j(Pij );

it is a semiconjugacy between σ and f . Abusing notation we think of
τ, τn, α, αn as functions on Σ+ by pulling them back via π.

Deﬁne the symbolic zeta function, also called the Ruelle zeta function for

Σ+, by

˜ζ(s) = exp  ∞
Xn=1

n Xσnx=x

e−sτn(x)! = Yˆx∈ ˜P

(1 − e−|λ(ˆx)|s)−1

where ˜P is the collection of primitive periodic orbits of σ. This is convergent
and analytic for ℜ(s) > δ.

For each ℓ ∈ Z, let χℓ(x) = xℓ be a unitary character S1 → S1, and deﬁne

˜ζ(s, ℓ) = exp  ∞
Xn=1

n Xσnx=x

χℓ(αn(x))e−sτn(x)! .

By comparison with ˜ζ(s), ˜ζ(s, ℓ) converges for ℜ(s) > δ.

Let

so that

˜Zn(s, ℓ) := Xσnx=x
˜ζ(s, ℓ) = exp  ∞
Xn=1

χℓ(αn(x))e−sτn(x)

n

˜Zn(s, ℓ)! .

These functions ˜Zn are related to our transfer operators by the following
proposition, which is originally due to Ruelle [13] (see also [9], [10, Appen-
dix]).

For each 1 ≤ j ≤ k0, let φj ∈ C 1(U ) be the characteristic function of Uj,

recalling that U is the disjoint union of Uj.

Proposition 6.1. Fix a0 > 0, b0 > 0. There exists xj ∈ Pj, j = 1, · · · , k0,
such that for any ǫ > 0, there exists Cǫ > 0 such that for all n ≥ 2 and for
any ℓ ∈ Z,

for all |ℑ(s)| + |ℓ| > b0 and |ℜ(s) − δ| ≤ a0 (here κ > 1 is the expansion rate
of f ).

In the rest of this section, suppose that f is not conjugate to a monomial
x±d for d ∈ N. If the Julia set of f is contained in a circle, we only consider
ℓ = 0; and otherwise, ℓ is any integer.

Fix ǫ > 0. Let ǫ0 = ǫ0(ǫ) > 0 be as given by Theorem 2.5. Then by

Proposition 6.1 and Theorem 2.5, we have, for some Cǫ > 1,

| ˜Zn(s, ℓ)| ≤ Cǫ(|ℑ(s)| + |ℓ|)2+ǫρn
ǫ

for all |ℑ(s)| + |ℓ| > 1 and |ℜ(s) − δ| < ǫ0; here we adjust ρǫ and ǫ0 slightly
if needed.

Since

log ˜ζ(s, ℓ) =

Xn=1

we deduce that for all |ℑ(s)| + |ℓ| > 1 and |ℜ(s) − δ| < ǫ0,

(6.1)

for some Cǫ > 1.

| log ˜ζ(s, ℓ)| ≤ Cǫ(|ℑ(s)| + |ℓ|)2+ǫ

The following follows from the estimates (6.1) for ℓ = 0 (cf. [10]):

Corollary 6.2. The zeta function ˜ζ(s) is non-vanishing and analytic on
ℜ(s) ≥ δ except for the simple pole at s = δ.

Proof. The estimates (6.1), together with the RPF theorem, implies that the
non-lattice property holds for τ , in the sense that there exist no function
L : J → mZ for some m ∈ R and a Lipschitz function u : J → R such that

(6.2)
Indeed, if τ satisﬁes (6.2), than ˜ζ has poles at δ + 2pπi/m for all p ∈ Z,
which contradicts (6.1) (see [10] for details). The claim then follows from
[8].
(cid:3)

τ = L + u − u ◦ f.

In view of this corollary, by making ǫ0 smaller if necessary, we deduce

from (6.1):

Proposition 6.3.

(1) For ℓ = 0, ˜ζ(s) = ˜ζ(s, 0) is analytic and non-

vanishing on ℜ(s) ≥ δ − ǫ0 except for the simple pole at s = δ.

(2) For ℓ 6= 0, ˜ζ(s, ℓ) is analytic and non-vanishing on ℜ(s) ≥ δ − ǫ0.
(3) For any ǫ > 0, there exists Cǫ > 1 such that for any ℓ ∈ Z, we have

log |˜ζ(s, ℓ)| ≤ Cǫ · (|ℓ| + 1)2+ǫ · |ℑ(s)|2+ǫ

for all ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ0 and |ℑ(s)| ≥ 1.

Due to a result of Manning [15], these analytic properties of ˜ζ(s, ℓ) can

be transferred to those of ζ(s, ℓ):

ζ(s, ℓ) = exp


∞

Xn=1

1

n Xf nx=x

χℓ(αn(x)) · e−sτn(x)
 .

Theorem 6.4 (Manning [15]). There exists ǫ1 > 0 such that for any ℓ ∈ Z,
the ratio

˜ζ(s, ℓ)
ζ(s, ℓ)

is holomorphic, bounded, and non-vanishing on ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ1.

Therefore Proposition 6.3 holds for ζ(s, ℓ) as well as for ˜ζ(s, ℓ), which

ﬁnishes the proof of Theorem 1.2.

We can convert this into a bound on the logarithmic derivative of ζ(s, ℓ).
By an extra application of Phragmen-Lindenlof theorem (as in [9]), for any
ǫ > 0, there exist Cǫ > 1, 0 < ǫ1 < ǫ0, and 0 < β < 1 such that for all
ℜ(s) > δ − ǫ1 and |ℑ(s)| ≥ 1,

(6.3)

≤ Cǫ · (|ℓ| + 1)2+ǫ · |ℑ(s)|β.

Deﬁne the counting function:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ζ(s, ℓ)′

ζ(s, ℓ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

πℓ(t) := Xˆx∈Pt

χℓ(λθ(ˆx))

where Pt is the set of all primitive periodic orbits of f with e|λ(ˆx)| < t in the
Julia set J.

Now using Proposition 6.3 and (6.3), the arguments of [9] deduce the

following from (6.3):

Proposition 6.5. There exists η > 0 such that

(1)

π0(t) = Li(eδt) + O(e(δ−η)t);

(2) for any ǫ > 0 and any ℓ 6= 0, we have

πℓ(t) = O((|ℓ| + 1)2+ǫe(δ−η)t)

where the implied constant depends only on ǫ.

Now let ψ ∈ C 4(S1). Then we can write ψ = P aℓχℓ by the Fourier
expansion where a0 = R ψdm, and aℓ = O(|ℓ|−4). Then we deduce from

Proposition 6.5 that

(6.4)

ψ(λθ(ˆx)) =Z ψdm · Li(eδt) + O(e(δ−η)t).

Xˆx∈Pt

Recalling that there are at most 2d − 2 periodic orbits of f which do not lie
on J, Proposition 6.5 and (6.4) provide Theorem 1.1.

Remark on equidistribution We remark that the arguments of Bowen
[1], Parry [7], and Parry-Pollicott [8] can be used to obtain the main terms
of our result in slightly stronger form. Their results imply that the col-
lection of pairs {(ˆx, λθ(ˆx)) : ˆx is a primitive periodic orbit with |λ(ˆx)| < T }
equidistributes in J × S1 with respect to the product measure ν × m. It
is likely that a combination of our approach with their techniques would
provide an eﬀective joint equidistribution theorem, but we shall not address
that here.
