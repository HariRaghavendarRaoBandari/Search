PIERRE ALBIN

Dedicated to Steven Zucker on the occasion of his 65th birthday

Abstract. This article is a survey of recent work of the author, together with Markus
Banagl, Eric Leichtnam, Rafe Mazzeo, and Paolo Piazza, on the Hodge theory of stratiﬁed
spaces. We discuss how to resolve a Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space to a manifold with corners
with an iterated ﬁbration structure and the generalization of a perversity in the sense of
Goresky-MacPherson to a mezzoperversity. We deﬁne Cheeger spaces and their signatures
and describe how to carry out the analytic proof of the Novikov conjecture on these spaces.
Finally we review the reductive Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation of a locally symmetric space
to a stratiﬁed space and describe its resolution to a manifold with corners.

1. Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to describe some recent advances in the Hodge theory of

pseudomanifolds.

Algebraic varieties and L2-metrics have been integral aspects of Hodge theory from the
very beginning. Hodge appealed to the Dirichlet principle [60] and the Levi parametrix
method [61, 62] to ﬁnd harmonic forms in each de Rham cohomology class and used these
forms to study the cohomology of complex projective algebraic varieties. Weyl [116] referred
to [62] as “one of the great landmarks in the history of our science in the present century”
(and corrected Hodge’s existence proof in [115]). An existence proof using purely Hilbert
space methods was carried out by Gaﬀney [47, 48] who, for instance, considered the exte-
rior derivative d on a smooth manifold X as an unbounded operator on square integrable
diﬀerential forms with domain

Dmax(d) = {ω ∈ L2(X; Λ•T ∗X) : dω ∈ L2(X; Λ•T ∗X)},

where dω is computed distributionally. This domain forms a complex whose cohomology,
known as the L2-cohomology of X, was introduced independently in [118] on a complete
manifold and in [36] on an incomplete manifold.

Algebraic varieties are often singular but Whitney [67,117] showed that they are stratiﬁed
spaces. This means that they can be decomposed into smooth manifold pieces of various
dimensions, called strata, in such a way that diﬀerent points on the same stratum have sim-
ilar neighborhoods in the variety. In particular one of these pieces is an open dense smooth
manifold. Endowing this ‘regular part’ with a conic-type Riemannian metric, Cheeger stud-
ied the de Rham complex of diﬀerential forms in L2. He singled out a topological condition
that guaranteed that the exterior derivative had an unambiguous deﬁnition as an unbounded
operator, every cohomology class had a harmonic representative, and the resulting cohomol-
ogy groups satisfy Poincar´e duality. In the case of conic singularities he explained how, if
this topological condition failed, one can choose ideal boundary conditions and still establish

these results. In this note I will review recent work [1, 3–5] extending Cheeger’s results to
general stratiﬁed ‘pseudomanifolds’.

Speciﬁcally, let (cid:98)X denote a pseudomanifold (a stratiﬁed space ‘without boundary’) and
endow its regular part (cid:98)X reg with a ‘wedge metric’ g. The exterior derivative d and its formal
There are two canonical extensions of ðdR to a closed operator on L2((cid:98)X reg; Λ•T ∗(cid:98)X reg). The

ðdR = d + δ : C∞

ﬁrst has domain

Dmax(ðdR) = {ω ∈ L2((cid:98)X reg; Λ•T ∗(cid:98)X reg) : ðdRω ∈ L2((cid:98)X reg; Λ•T ∗(cid:98)X reg)}

where ðdRω is computed distributionally, and the second has domain

Dmin(ðdR) = {ω ∈ L2((cid:98)X reg; Λ•T ∗(cid:98)X reg) : ∃(ωn) ⊆ C∞

c ((cid:98)X reg; Λ•T ∗(cid:98)X reg) s.t. ωn → ω in L2

and (ðdRωn) is L2-Cauchy}

and ðdRω can be computed both distributionally and as lim ðdRωn.

Cheeger [36] singled out a class of spaces, now known as Witt spaces [106], where for a

suitably chosen metric we have

This implies that many of the classical Hodge theory results will hold on (cid:98)X. For example, the

Dmin(ðdR) = Dmax(ðdR).

L2-cohomology is ﬁnite dimensional, represented by harmonic forms, and satisﬁes Poincar´e
duality. Moreover, Cheeger showed that this cohomology coincides with the (middle perver-
sity) intersection homology of Goresky-MacPherson and so in particular one can study the
signature of intersection homology using analytic tools.

The signature is an important invariant of smooth manifolds, e.g., in [56], Gromov says
that it is “the invariant, which can be matched in the beauty and power only by the Euler
characteristic”. The bordism invariance of the signature implies that it is a polynomial in
the rational Pontryagin classes, and Hirzebruch’s signature theorem identiﬁed the polyno-
mial with the ‘L-class’. The signature is also invariant under (oriented) homotopies and
Novikov proved that, for a simply connected oriented manifold, the only rational Pontryagin
characteristic class that is (oriented) homotopy invariant is the ‘top order part’ of the L-class.
He deﬁned ‘higher signatures’ on non-simply connected manifolds and the celebrated, still
open, Novikov conjecture claims that these are homotopy invariant and they are the only
ones.

Due to the importance of the conjecture and the ubiquity of singular spaces, it is natural
to study the Novikov conjecture on pseudomanifolds. A fruitful approach due to Lusztig [82],
Mishchenko [93], and Kasparov [69] involves the Atiyah-Singer index theorem for families of
operators but with C∗-algebra bundles (see [100] for a recent survey of the Novikov conjec-
ture). In [3] we carried out this approach to the Novikov conjecture on Witt spaces. In the
process we established Cheeger’s results on Witt spaces by an approach that lent itself to
allowing C∗-algebra bundles.

In [4,5] we carried out the analytic approach to the Novikov conjecture on a larger class of
stratiﬁed spaces. In [36], Cheeger considered non-Witt spaces with isolated conic singularities
and explained that one could still deﬁne an L2 cohomology theory satisfying Poincar´e duality
by choosing ‘ideal boundary conditions’ at the cone points. In [4] we explain how to use ideal

boundary conditions on a general pseudomanifold to deﬁne a self-adjoint Fredholm domain
for the de Rham operator, and an associated L2-de Rham cohomology complex. We call
the spaces that admit ideal boundary conditions for the signature operator Cheeger spaces
in recognition of Cheeger’s contributions. In [5] we carry out the analytic approach to the
Novikov conjecture on Cheeger spaces.
Our ﬁrst step, described in §6, is to resolve the geometry in the sense of Melrose (e.g., [91])

by replacing a stratiﬁed space (cid:98)X with a smooth manifold with corners (cid:101)X, so that the regular
part of (cid:98)X becomes the interior of (cid:101)X. The idea of resolving a stratiﬁed space goes back at

from the singular one. Having replaced one compactiﬁcation (cid:98)X of the regular part by another
one (cid:101)X, we next replace the cotangent bundle T ∗(cid:101)X by a ‘rescaled bundle’, the wedge cotangent
bundle wT ∗(cid:101)X, that reﬂects the original degeneration of (cid:98)X. This replacement brings out the

Collapsing the ﬁbers of these ﬁbrations in the appropriate order recovers the singular space
from the smooth space, while ‘blowing-up’ the singular strata constructs the smooth space

least as far as Thom [111] and continues to be an object of study [9]. In our formulation
the stratiﬁcation is replaced by a boundary ﬁbration structure: each boundary hypersurface

iterative structure of the de Rham operator as we describe fully in §3.1. A key fact is that
these replacements do not change the regular part of the stratiﬁed space nor the cotangent
bundle over the regular part; since analysis on a stratiﬁed space means analysis on the regular
part, these convenient replacements have not changed the problem we wish to solve.
Once these changes are made, ðdR is amenable to study using the microanalytic tools
developed in, e.g., [76, 85, 87, 90, 92, 105]. We explain how to use these tools ﬁrst in the case
of a single singular stratum in §3 and then for an arbitrary pseudomanifold in §4. One of the
features of our approach is to take advantage of the iterative structure of the space and the
operator which means that most of the analytic diﬃculties are already present for a single
singular stratum.

If (cid:98)X has a single singular stratum Y, then (cid:101)X is a smooth manifold with boundary and its

boundary participates in a ﬁber bundle of smooth closed manifolds

Z − ∂(cid:101)X

φ−−→ Y

with base Y and typical ﬁber Z. Using the microlocal tools mentioned above, we see in §3.3
that elements in Dmax(ðdR) have (distributional) asymptotic expansions as they approach

ω ∈ Dmax(ðdR) =⇒ ω ∼ r−v/2(α(ω) + dr ∧ β(ω)) +(cid:101)ω as r → 0

the boundary of (cid:101)X,
where(cid:101)ω is a ‘remainder’ and α(ω), β(ω) are distributional forms on Y,
α(ω), β(ω) ∈ C−∞(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ Hdim Z/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y )),
with coeﬃcients in Hdim Z/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ) the vertical Hodge cohomology of the boundary ﬁbration.

These forms serve as ‘Cauchy data’ for ω. For example we show that the minimal domain is
determined by the vanishing of the Cauchy data. Thus if v is odd or Hdim Z/2
(Z) = 0 (which
is the ‘Witt condition’ in this context) then the maximal domain is the same as the minimal

domain. Otherwise Hdim Z/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ) is a ﬂat bundle and for every ﬂat subbundle W,

we deﬁne a domain for ðdR by
DW (ðdR) = {ω ∈ Dmax(ðdR) :

α(ω) ∈ C−∞(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ W ),

β(ω) ∈ C−∞(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ W ⊥)}.
We refer to W as a mezzoperversity and to DW (ðdR) as imposing Cheeger ideal boundary
conditions. With this domain, we see in §3.4 that ðdR is a self-adjoint Fredholm operator with
compact resolvent and hence the Hodge cohomology groups H∗
In section 3.5 we explain how W determines a domain for the exterior derivative, DW (d), and
a Fredholm Hilbert complex in the sense of [31]. The corresponding de Rham cohomology

In §4 we explain how these constructions can be carried out on a general pseudomanifold.
This involves an inductive procedure: assuming we have carried out this analysis of Hodge
and de Rham cohomology on pseudomanifolds of depth less than k, we can carry out it out
on spaces of depth k. A mezzoperversity in this context consists of system of ﬂat bundles,
W = (W1, . . . , W(cid:96)), one over each non-Witt stratum, satisfying a compatibility condition at

the corners of (cid:101)X. To each mezzoperversity we assign ﬁnite dimensional de Rham and Hodge

yielding a generalized Poincar´e duality in the sense of [53]. This will be a ‘true’ Poincar´e
duality if W = DW but there are topological obstructions to the existence of such self-dual
mezzoperversities, notably the signatures of the ﬁbers of the boundary ﬁbrations. We refer
to a pseudomanifold with a self-dual mezzoperversity as a Cheeger space.

Section 5 is devoted to explaining that these cohomology theories share many interesting
properties with the usual cohomology theories of smooth manifolds. For example we show
that the de Rham cohomology is independent of the metric used to deﬁne it. The key fact is
that the boundary conditions can be deﬁned using de Rham cohomology instead of Hodge
cohomology, allowing us (inductively) to deﬁne the boundary conditions without reference
to a metric.

We also show that the cohomology is invariant under stratiﬁed homotopy equivalences.
This is a bit tricky since pull-back by a homotopy equivalence need not deﬁne a bounded
operator on L2. We make use of a clever construction of Hilsum and Skandalis [59] to de-
ﬁne a bounded pull-back map, and then explain how it acts on mezzoperversities and on
cohomology.

On Cheeger spaces self-dual mezzoperversities deﬁne, through the quadratic form (1.1), a
signature. In §5.3 we explain how a self-dual mezzoperversity determines a domain for the
signature operator on which it is Fredholm with index the signature of (1.1). If two Cheeger
spaces, endowed with self-dual mezzoperversities, are bordant (with a Cheeger space bordism
and an extension of the self-dual mezzoperversities) then the signature does not change.
Together with a theorem of Banagl [11], this implies that the signature of (1.1) depends only

on (cid:98)X and not on the self-dual mezzoperversity! Thus every Cheeger space has a signature

that is invariant under Cheeger space bordism and stratiﬁed homotopy equivalences.

A beautiful approach to characteristic classes of Thom [110] allows us to use this signature
to deﬁne an L-class in homology. (This same approach was used by Goresky-MacPherson [53]
and Banagl [11]; Cheeger [38] used η-invariants of the links to give a combinatorial formula
for the L-class of a Witt space.) In §5.4 we deﬁne the L-class of a Cheeger space and use
it to deﬁne the higher signatures. In [5] we carry out the analytic approach to the Novikov
conjecture and prove that these higher signatures are stratiﬁed homotopy invariant for a
large class of Cheeger spaces.

these sheaf complexes. Also self-dual mezzoperversities precisely correspond to the self-dual
sheaves studied by Banagl. This yields the ‘de Rham theorem’ to complement our ‘Hodge
theorem’ and completes the analogy between our new cohomology theories and the classical
cohomology of closed manifolds.
The ﬁnal two sections discuss the geometry of stratiﬁed spaces. Most of §6 is devoted to
showing the equivalence of Thom-Mather stratiﬁed spaces and manifolds with corners and
boundary ﬁbration structures. To exemplify the usefulness of this equivalence we include
a description of a smooth de Rham complex that computes the intersection cohomology
of any (Goresky-MacPherson) perversity function. One of the most interesting sources of
stratiﬁed spaces is the reductive Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation of a locally symmetric space,
introduced by Zucker in [122], which we discuss in the ﬁnal section, §7. By resolving this
stratiﬁed space we obtain a new compactiﬁcation, the resolved Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation,
of a locally symmetric space to a manifold with corners and a boundary ﬁbration structure.

of algebraic varieties developed intersection homology.

• Goresky and MacPherson while working to develop a theory of characteristic classes
• Cheeger’s proof of the Ray-Singer conjecture on the equality of analytic torsion and
Reidemeister torsion inspired his study of the L2-cohomology of diﬀerential forms on
the regular part of a variety.
• A generalization by Deligne of work of Zucker on extending a variation of Hodge
structure from the complement of a divisor to the entirety of a nonsingular complex
algebraic variety.

The very fruitful history of this development is discussed in detail through 1989 in [72] and
has continued apace. Our focus in this expository paper is on the L2 cohomology of singular
spaces, continuing the work of Cheeger [36–38, 41].

2.1. Stratiﬁed spaces. Let us start by considering a particular example of the general
situation we will be studying. Whitney’s umbrella is given by

W = {(x, y, z) ∈ R3 : x2 − zy2 = 0}.

The gradient of the deﬁning polynomial is (2x,−2yz,−y2), so the critical points make up the
{z-axis}. At every point p ∈ W \{z-axis}, the inverse function theorem guarantees that there
is a neighborhood of p in W that is diﬀeomorphic to an open ball in R2. Thus, this ‘regular
part’ of W , W reg, forms a two dimensional smooth manifold and we have a decomposition
of W into two smooth manifolds

W = {z-axis} ∪ W reg.

This is the ﬁrst feature we will ask of a stratiﬁed space: it is a union of smooth manifolds,
often of diﬀerent dimensions. Each of these manifolds is called a stratum and we talk about
the collection of strata.

Manifolds have a local homogeneity: every point has a neighborhood diﬀeomorphic to the
same Euclidean ball. Local homogeneity is a second feature we will require of each stratum
of a stratiﬁed space. Of course every point on the z-axis has a neighborhood on the z-axis
diﬀeomorphic to an interval, but what we want is to look at neighborhoods of points on the
z-axis as subsets of W . The intersections of W with the planes z = c consist of

 two lines: x = cy, x = −cy

one line: x = 0
one point: x = y = 0

if c > 0
if c = 0
if c < 0

so we see that a point on the negative z-axis has a neighborhood in W homeomorphic to
an interval, while a point on the positive z-axis has a neighborhood in W homeomorphic to
an interval (on the z-axis) times a small cross, which we think of as a truncated cone on
four points, (0, 1) × C({ four points }). Thus to have local homogeneity we have to reﬁne
the decomposition of W to

W = { origin } ∪ { negative z-axis } ∪ { positive z-axis } ∪ (W \ {z-axis}).

This exhibits W as a disjoint union of four strata: one 0-dimensional, two 1-dimensional,
and one 2-dimensional, and each stratum is locally homogeneous.

We defer the formal deﬁnition of a stratiﬁed space to §6 and meanwhile content ourselves
with an informal description and some examples. For us a stratiﬁed space will always mean a

“Thom-Mather stratiﬁcation”; for other notions of stratiﬁcation we refer the interested reader
to the excellent surveys [64, 73]. Roughly speaking this means that we have a topological

space (cid:98)X with a decomposition into smooth manifold pieces called strata. The stratum of
largest dimension, (cid:98)X reg, is called the regular part and is assumed to be dense; the other
neighborhood in (cid:98)X homeomorphic to Bh × C(Z), for some stratiﬁed space Z called the link
of Y in (cid:98)X. Moreover each stratum Y has a ‘tubular neighborhood’ T in (cid:98)X that is the total

strata are called singular. Each stratum Y is ‘locally homogeneous’ in that each point has a

space of a ﬁber bundle

C(Z) — T −→ Y.

A stratiﬁed space is called a pseudomanifold if all of the singular strata have codimension at
least two. (The Whitney umbrella is a stratiﬁed space but not a pseudomanifold.)

A key feature of stratiﬁed spaces is that they show up even when our main object of

interest is smooth.

{f1, . . . , fk}. The Jacobian matrix of F = (f1, . . . , fk) has rank in {0, . . . , k} at each point in

Example 1 (Algebraic varieties). Suppose (cid:98)X is the zero set of a ﬁnite set of polynomials
(cid:98)X. The sets
partition (cid:98)X into smooth manifolds, but do not always form a stratiﬁcation. Nevertheless,

Yk = {ζ ∈ (cid:98)X : rank(DF )(ζ) = k}

Whitney [117] showed that this partition can always be reﬁned to yield a stratiﬁcation (see
[67]).

Example 2 (Group Actions). Another common example of a stratiﬁed set is the orbit space
of a smooth manifold under the action of a compact Lie group. Suppose that M is a smooth
manifold with an action of the compact Lie group G, meaning a homomorphism G −→
Diﬀ(M ). Recall that to each point ζ ∈ M we associate an orbit G · ζ and a stabilizer Gζ,

G · ζ = {g(ζ) ∈ M : g ∈ G} ⊆ M, Gζ = {g ∈ G : g(ζ) = ζ} ⊆ G.

Note that the stabilizer group changes along an orbit since

Gg(ζ) = gGζg−1,

suggesting that a better invariant is the conjugacy class of the stabilizer. This is borne out by
a classical result of Borel: the orbit space M/G = {G· ζ : ζ ∈ M} inherits a smooth manifold
structure along the projection M −→ M/G if all of the stabilizer groups Gζ are conjugate to
each other in G.

In general the space M/G is a stratiﬁed space. Given a subgroup H of G, let [H] denote

its conjugacy class in G, and let

M[H] = {ζ ∈ M : Gζ ∈ [H]}.

It’s clear from the above that M[H] is closed under the action of G and Borel’s theorem implies
that M[H]/G is a smooth manifold. This exhibits M/G as a union of smooth manifolds.
The fact that this decomposition is a stratiﬁcation follows from the fact that the M[H] have
equivariant tubular neighborhoods in M.

(In [6] we discuss the resolution of a group action. The minimal isotropy type X can be
identiﬁed with the interior of a smooth manifold with corners Y (M ) endowed with a G-action
and an equivariant map

β : Y (M ) −→ M.

The manifold Y (M ) has an iterated ﬁbration structure in the sense of §6.4 where all spaces
have G-actions and all maps are equivariant. Moreover Y (M ) and the bases of its boundary
ﬁbrations have unique isotropy types and hence manifold orbit spaces. The orbit space of
Y (M ) thus inherits an iterated ﬁbration structure and can be identiﬁed with the resolution
of the stratiﬁed space M/G.)

As explained in [64], If M and G are not smooth, or the action of G on M is not smooth,
then the orbit space M/G need not admit a Thom-Mather stratiﬁcation. This is the case
even for a ﬁnite group and was one of the main motivations for introducing more general
notions of stratiﬁcation.

Example 3 (Moduli spaces). A moduli space is a space, usually an open manifold, whose
points represent (isomorphism classes of ) geometric objects of some ﬁxed kind. Moduli spaces
often involve singular spaces in two ways. On the one hand natural compactiﬁcations of
moduli spaces are often singular. On the other hand, points in the boundary of the compact-
iﬁcation can often be interpreted as moduli of singular versions of the original objects.

For example, let Σg be a smooth oriented surface of genus g, say g > 1, and let Cg
denote the space of complex structures on Σg. The orientation preserving diﬀeomorphisms
of Σg, Diﬀ +(Σg), act naturally on Cg and Teichm¨uller space is the quotient by the subgroup
Diﬀ +

0 (Σg) of diﬀeomorphisms isotopic to the identity,

a gradient-like function on M (e.g., the gradient of f with respect to a Riemannian metric)
and let Φt denote the ﬂow generated by −V. The stable/unstable manifolds associated to this

Example 5 (Homology classes). If X is a topological space, we say that a homology class
h ∈ H∗(X) is realizable by a smooth manifold if there is a closed orientable manifold M and
a continuous map f : M −→ X such that

h = f∗[M ].

Steenrod’s problem consists of describing the realizable homology classes when X is a smooth
manifold. Thom [109] proved that all classes are realizable with Z2 or Q coeﬃcients. He
showed that all elements of Hj(X; Z) are realizable for j ≤ 6 and for dim X − 2 ≤ j < dim X
and provided an explicit example of a non-realizable class. Goresky showed that you can
represent every homology class of a smooth manifold by a stratiﬁed subset [52, 95].
(Thom’s results do not hold if we impose conditions on f beyond being continuous, e.g., [55]
shows that there are homology classes with Z2 coeﬃcients that can not be realized by immersed
submanifolds. See also [22, 29, 99, 101].)

Example 6 (Locally symmetric spaces). Let G be a connected semisimple algebraic group
deﬁned over Q, G(R) its real points, regarded as a Lie group, K a maximal compact subgroup
of G, Γ a torsion-free arithmetic subgroup, and

X = Γ(cid:31)G(R)(cid:30)K

the corresponding locally symmetric space. This is generally non-compact but there are many
natural compactiﬁcations of X, see [25]. The reductive Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation (see
[122]) is a stratiﬁed space obtained by adding one stratum per Γ-conjugacy class of rational
parabolic subgroups P of G. We will review this and related compactiﬁcations in §7.
2.2. Intersection homology and Witt spaces. One of the primary motivations for [53]
was a question of Sullivan: what is the largest class of spaces with singularities to which the
signature of manifolds extends as a cobordism invariant?

Recall that on a smooth oriented manifold Poincar´e duality deﬁnes a non-degenerate
pairing on (co)homology whose signature is the signature of the manifold. The singular
homology of a stratiﬁed space does not satisfy Poincar´e duality.

Example 7. If M is a smooth manifold, its (unreduced) suspension is the quotient space

SM = (M × [0, 1])/{(m1, 0) ∼ (m2, 0) and (m1, 1) ∼ (m2, 1) for all mi ∈ M}

which is naturally a pseudomanifold with singular stratum the two cone points. A Mayer-
Vietoris argument shows that

(cid:101)Hk(SM ) ∼= (cid:101)Hk−1(M ), k ≥ 0.

In particular if M is a two dimensional torus,

H0(SM ) = Z, H1(SM ) = Z, H2(SM ) = Z ⊕ Z, H3(SM ) = Z

and we see that Poincar´e duality can not hold.

Goresky-MacPherson came up with the brave idea of redeﬁning homology to recover
Poincar´e duality. The key is to keep track of the failure of transversality of the chains with
the singular set. We keep track of this with a perversity function p, a function from {2, 3, . . .}
to N0 such that p(c) and q(c) = 2 − c − p(c) are both non-negative and non-decreasing. The
perversity q is known as the dual perversity to p. (For more general perversity functions,
see [44].)

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

Intersection homology can be deﬁned analogously to singular homology but maintaining

control of the dimensions of the intersections of chains and singularities [70]. Let (cid:98)X be a
i ((cid:98)X), be the free group with generators

stratiﬁed space of dimension n and let Yk be the union of the strata of dimension k. Given
a perversity function p let the admissible chains, AC p
the singular i-simplices

f : ∆i −→ (cid:98)X s.t. f−1(Yn−j) ⊆ i − j + p(j)-skeleton of ∆i for all j,

i ((cid:98)X) : ∂f ∈ AC p
i ((cid:98)X) = Hi(SC p∗ ((cid:98)X)).

The intersection homology groups of perversity p are the homology groups of the complex

(For the deﬁnition of intersection homology through complexes of sheaves see our §5.5 below.)
Example 8. Consider again the suspension of a smooth m-dimensional manifold M, SM.
Here Y0 consists of two points and the regular part is

X = SM \ Y0 = M × (0, 1).

A perversity consists of a single integer p(m + 1) ∈ [0, m− 1], and the intersection homology
is given by

IHp

k(SM ) =

k < m − p(m + 1)
k = m − p(m + 1)

Hk−1(M ) k > m − p(m + 1)

i ((cid:98)X) −→ Z.

The intuition is that allowable chains avoid the suspension points in low dimensions, and so
really map into X, but not in high dimensions (cf. [71, proof of Proposition 4.7.2]).

Goresky-MacPherson proved that the intersection pairing induces a non-degenerate pairing

In general diﬀerent perversities give rise to diﬀerent groups. The closest dual perversities,

m

m = (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, . . .), n = (0, 1, 1, 2, 2, . . .),

More generally, Siegel [106, Theorem I.3.4] showed that if every even dimensional link Z

are known respectively as the upper and lower middle perversities and diﬀer only with respect

to strata of odd codimension. Thus if (cid:98)X has only even codimensional strata (e.g., a complex
variety) then IHm∗ ((cid:98)X) is dually paired with itself.
(Z) = 0, then IHm∗ ((cid:98)X) is dually paired with itself. He called these spaces

satisﬁes IHdim Z/2
Witt spaces and proved that the signature is a Witt-bordism invariant, i.e., if two Witt spaces
are cobordant via a Witt space (with boundary) then their signatures coincide. Banagl [10]
managed to extend Poincar´e duality to stratiﬁed spaces that are not necessarily Witt by
studying the category of sheaves that are self-dual and compatible with the sheaf-theoretic
approach to intersection homology (see §5.5). Spaces that carry a self-dual sheaf of this type
(not every space does) are known as L-spaces. Banagl mentions in [10] that the ‘idea of
employing Lagrangian subspaces in order to obtain self-duality’ is invoked in unpublished
work of Morgan and is also present in Cheeger’s ideal boundary conditions. Indeed in [1] we
show that a Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space is an L-space if and only if it is a Cheeger space.

2.3. L2 cohomology. If (M, g) is a Riemannian manifold, the metric deﬁnes a volume form
and a bundle metric on the exterior powers of the cotangent bundle, Λ•T ∗M. The space of
L2 diﬀerential forms can be deﬁned to be the closure of C∞
c (M ; Λ•T ∗M ) with respect to the
norm

(cid:90)

M

and is then a Hilbert space. The exterior derivative is an unbounded operator

d : C∞

c (M ; Λ•T ∗M ) −→ C∞

c (M ; Λ•T ∗M )

and its formal adjoint is the operator

δ : C∞

c (M ; Λ•T ∗M ) −→ C∞

c (M ; Λ•T ∗M )

characterized by

(cid:104)dω, η(cid:105)L2 = (cid:104)ω, δη(cid:105)L2.

If ω and η are L2 diﬀerential forms we say that the dω = η holds weakly (or distribution-

ally) if

(cid:104)ω, δα(cid:105)L2 = (cid:104)η, α(cid:105)L2 for all α ∈ C∞

c (M ; Λ•T ∗M ).

The maximal domain of d is

Dmax(d) = {ω ∈ L2(M ; Λ•T ∗M ) : dω ∈ L2(M ; Λ•T ∗M )

where dω is computed distributionally. If we denote the k-forms in the maximal domain of
d by

Dmax(d)k = Dmax(d) ∩ L2(M ; ΛkT ∗M )

then we obtain a complex

0 −→ Dmax(d)0

d−−→ Dmax(d)1

d−−→ . . .

d−−→ Dmax(d)dim M −→ 0.

The cohomology of this complex is the L2-cohomology of M (see, e.g., [34] for an introduction
to L2-cohomology).
If (M, g) is not complete then typically there are many closed domains for d other than
Dmax(d). A Hilbert complex for d consists of a choice of domains D such that (d,D) is a
closed operator and

0 −→ D(d)0

d−−→ D(d)1

d−−→ . . .

d−−→ D(d)dim M −→ 0

forms a complex. An excellent study of Hilbert complexes is carried out in [31].

One of the motivations behind [1,4,5] was to ﬁnd an analytic version of Banagl’s cohomol-
ogy groups by deﬁning appropriate Hilbert complexes. As mentioned above, Cheeger showed
in [37, §6] that the L2-cohomology groups coincide with intersection cohomology with per-
versity m. He also came across the Witt condition independently in [36] and described ideal
boundary conditions for isolated conic singularities as a way of recovering Poincar´e duality.
We explain below (§3.4) how to use the analytic properties of the de Rham operator ðdR
to impose ideal boundary conditions, and then how to use the Kodaira decomposition and
these ideal boundary conditions to deﬁne Hilbert complexes (§3.5).

Let us mention some related but diﬀerent approaches. Signatures for general pseudoman-
ifolds are deﬁned in [15, 45, 65]. These can not be bordism invariant (since the cone over a
smooth manifold would make the manifold bordant to a point) and it would be interesting
to understand their relation with Cheeger spaces. There are also analytic studies of other

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

13

perversity functions in, e.g., [14, 65].

We mention a few instances of the vast literature on the L2 cohomology of complete met-
rics. Already in [8], Atiyah, Patodi, and Singer explain that the ‘correct analytical context’
for their signature theorem is the signature of the L2 harmonic forms on a manifold with
a cylindrical end. Zucker [119], in order to analyze the variation of Hodge structure on a
degenerating family of curves, worked out the L2 cohomology on a manifold with ends mod-
eled on the Poincar´e metric of a punctured disk; this is the intersection cohomology with
coeﬃcients. Still in the setting of complete metrics, Zucker [120] conjectured that the L2
cohomology of a Hermitian locally symmetric space arising from the real points of a semisim-
ple connected algebraic group deﬁned over Q would equal the intersection homology of its
Baily-Borel-Satake compactiﬁcation (see [25]), which is a singular space. This celebrated
conjecture was veriﬁed independently by Looijenga and Saper-Stern [81, 103]. Among many
others, let us list some of the results which are closest in spirit to the subject and methods
here

Phillips,

Melrose [90],

• the L2 cohomology of spaces with asymptotically cylindrical ends was determined by
• cusp ends by M¨uller [94],
• asymptotically geometrically ﬁnite hyperbolic quotients in [84, 86] by Mazzeo and
• ﬂat ends by Carron [35],
• asymptotically ﬁbered cusp ends and asymptotically ﬁbered boundary ends by Hausel,
• foliated analogues of the latter by Gell-Redman and Rochon [49], and
• iterated ﬁbered cusp metrics on stratiﬁed spaces by Hunsicker and Rochon [66].

Hunsicker, and Mazzeo [58],

Finally we point out that closely related to the L2-cohomology is the study of index
theorems. Cheeger’s study of L2-cohomology was part of his wider study of the spectral
geometry of singular spaces in [38] and found application to index theory problems even on
smooth spaces cf. [17–20, 39]. There has been a lot of work on index theory on spaces with
isolated conic singularities e.g., [32, 42, 43, 79] and recently also on index theory on spaces
with a single singular stratum [2, 7, 30, 40].

3. Depth one stratifications

a point in Y by Z, and we will denote dimensions by

A pseudomanifold (cid:98)X is said to have depth one if there is a single singular stratum. Thus
there is one regular stratum, (cid:98)X reg, and one singular stratum, Y. We denote the link of (cid:98)X at
related by n = h + v + 1. We assume that (cid:98)X is compact and, for notational convenience, also
that (cid:98)X reg, Y, and Z are connected. This situation presents most of the analytic complications
Our main object of study is the operator d + δ on diﬀerential forms on (cid:98)X reg. We will see

of the general case but has the advantage that the geometry is much simpler than the general
case. There are many treatments of analysis in this setting, for example [50, 74, 75, 77, 78, 87,
104].

n = dim (cid:98)X reg,

h = dim Y,

v = dim Z

The interior of (cid:101)X is naturally identiﬁed with (cid:98)X reg and so (cid:101)X is a compactiﬁcation of (cid:98)X reg to
a smooth manifold with boundary. A key fact for us is that analysis on (cid:98)X refers to analysis
on (cid:98)X reg and hence can equally well be carried out on (cid:101)X, with the advantage that this is a
A rigid wedge metric is a Riemannian metric on (cid:98)X reg = (cid:101)X◦ that, in a collar neighborhood

way to resolve this. Let us denote the induced bundle metric on the cotangent bundle still
by g, and deﬁne

E = {ω ∈ C∞((cid:101)X; T ∗(cid:101)X) : |ω|g is bounded }.

It turns out that the space E is the space of sections of a new bundle and g deﬁnes a
non-degenerate bundle metric on this bundle.

Precisely, there is a bundle which we call the wedge cotangent bundle and denote wT ∗(cid:101)X,

together with a map

such that

j : wT ∗(cid:101)X −→ T ∗(cid:101)X,

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

In local coordinates trivializing the ﬁber bundle φ in a neighborhood of a point q ∈ ∂(cid:101)X,
a section of T ∗(cid:101)X is locally spanned by dr, dyi, dzj, while a section of wT ∗(cid:101)X is locally spanned
Crucially, r dzj does not vanish at ∂(cid:101)X as a section of wT ∗(cid:101)X since it is not equal to r times
a section of wT ∗(cid:101)X.
The replacement of T ∗(cid:101)X by wT ∗(cid:101)X is very convenient. On the one hand, as anticipated
above, the deﬁnition of E implies that the metric g extends from (cid:101)X◦ to a non-degenerate
metric over all of (cid:101)X. On the other hand, let us consider the eﬀect of this change on the
behavior of d + δ near (cid:101)X. For simplicity of comparing d + δ in these two settings, let us

Vertical vector ﬁelds are the sections of a vector bundle T H/B −→ H, which participates in
a short exact sequence of bundles

0 −→ T H/B −→ T H −→ ϕ∗T B −→ 0.

The Lie bracket of two vertical vector ﬁelds is again a vertical vector ﬁeld and hence the

where the ﬁrst summand is the vertical exterior derivative, the second summand extends the

from the curvature of ϕ. In the special case where H = F × B and ϕ is the projection onto

Near ∂(cid:101)X we have a splitting

The local coordinate expression exhibits ðdR as an example of a wedge diﬀerential operator

algebra is the space of edge diﬀerential operators [85]. Put another way, a diﬀerential operator

(cid:88)

of order m is an edge diﬀerential operator if in every choice of local coordinates like (3.1) it
has the form

aj,α,β(r, y, z)(r∂r)j(r∂y)α∂β
z

where α and β are multi-indices and the coeﬃcients aj,α,β are smooth on all of (cid:101)X. A diﬀer-

j+|α|+|β|≤m

ential operator L of order m is a wedge diﬀerential operator if rmL is an edge diﬀerential
operator. Thus, since the above expression shows that rðdR can be written in terms of the
vector ﬁelds r∂r, r∂y, ∂z, we can conclude that ðdR is ﬁrst order wedge diﬀerential operator.
As such, its analysis proceeds by understanding three model operators known as the (wedge)
principal symbol, the normal operator, and the indicial operator.
Just as the principal symbol of a diﬀerential operator on a closed manifold is a section
deﬁned on the cotangent bundle, the principal symbol of ðdR as a wedge diﬀerential operator
standard ways, given ξ ∈ wT ∗
deﬁne

will be a section of End(Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) over wT ∗(cid:101)X. We can ﬁnd this symbol in one of the
p (cid:101)X choose a function f ∈ C∞((cid:101)X) such that df (p) = ξ and

σ(ðdR)(ξ) = [ðdR, f ](p) ∈ End(Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)).
g Id ∈ End(Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X))

(σ(ðdR)(ξ))2 = |ξ|2

It is easy to see that

so we see that ðdR is uniformly elliptic on (cid:101)X as a wedge diﬀerential operator.

The normal operator of ðdR is a family of operators parametrized by q ∈ Y. At each point
r × Zq × TqY with the metric dr2 + r2gZq + gTqY
q ∈ Y we look at then model wedge R+
obtained from g by freezing coeﬃcients at q. The de Rham operator of this metric is given
by

(3.3)
known as the normal operator of ðdR at q ∈ Y , and it is these operators that model the be-
is that the link Zq only enters through its de Rham operator, ðZq
dR.
The ﬁnal model operator, the indicial family, determines the leading order behavior of
elements in the null space of ðdR. Assume that we have an element of the null space that in
local coordinates has the form rζa(y, z) + O(rζ+1) for some ζ ∈ C. Applying ðdR yields

3.3. The maximal and minimal domain. The model operators described above can
be used to understand the behavior of ðdR on various diﬀerent function spaces. For our
purposes the most important will be (a) the L2 space of diﬀerential forms determined by the
Riemannian metric and (b) the edge Sobolev spaces. The latter are deﬁned by

e ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) = {ω ∈ L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) :

H m

P ω ∈ L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) for every edge diﬀerential operator P of order m}.

In fact an elliptic edge diﬀerential operator has a unique (closed) domain as an operator on
L2, namely the appropriate edge Sobolev space. As we will now explore, this is usually not
true for wedge diﬀerential operators such as ðdR.

The de Rham operator unambiguously deﬁnes an operator

c ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) −→ C∞

c ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)),

ðdR : C∞

Dmin(ðdR) = {ω ∈ L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) :

but if we wish to study ðdR as an operator on L2-diﬀerential forms we need to be careful
about its domain. Recall that an unbounded operator is said to be closed if its graph is a
closed set, and that a well-behaved operator (e.g., Fredholm or even non-empty resolvent
set) is necessarily closed. There are two canonical closed extensions of ðdR from smooth
compactly supported forms. First there is the minimal domain,

∃(ωn) ⊆ C∞

c ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) s.t. ωn → ω in L2 and ðdRωn is L2-Cauchy},
c ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X))). Secondly,
where ðdRω is computed distributionally. Clearly, if D ⊆ L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) is a closed

on which we deﬁne ðdRω = lim ðdRωn. This domain is characterized by the fact that the
graph of (ðdR,Dmin(ðdR)) is the closure of the graph of (ðdR,C∞
there is the maximal domain,

Dmax(ðdR) = {ω ∈ L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) : ðdRω ∈ L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X))}

c ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) then it must satisfy

domain for ðdR containing C∞

Dmin(ðdR) ⊆ D ⊆ Dmax(ðdR)

justifying the labels ‘minimal’ and ‘maximal’.

These domain are related to the edge Sobolev space of order one by the fact that rðdR is

an elliptic edge operator. In fact this yields that

e ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) ⊆ Dmin(ðdR) ⊆ Dmax(ðdR) ⊆ H 1

e ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)).

rH 1

It turns out that the key to distinguishing between closed extensions of ðdR lies in the
indicial operator. To see intuitively why this happens, suppose we have a diﬀerential form
supported near the boundary of the form rζa(y, z). The volume form of a wedge metric in
local coordinates is essentially of the form rv drdydz so that

rζa(y, z) ∈ L2 ⇐⇒ Re ζ + 1

2(v + 1) > 0.

Now if we also want to have

ðdR(rζa(y, z)) = rζ−1Iy(ðdR; ζ)a(y, z) + O(rζ)

in L2 we will need to have

Re ζ + 1

2(v + 1) > 1

or Re ζ + 1

2(v + 1) > 0 and Iy(ðdR; ζ)a(y, z) = 0.

20

PIERRE ALBIN

This suggests that a key rˆole will be played by

specb(ðdR; q) ∩ {ζ : 0 < Re ζ + 1

2(v + 1) ≤ 1},

and we now make an extra assumption on the metric in order to make this set as simple as
possible. Directly from (3.4) it is easy to see that the set specb(ðdR; q) can be determined
from the spectrum of ðZq
dR, the de Rham operator on Zq with respect to the metric gZq . By
rescaling this metric, we can assume that there is an interval around zero with no non-zero
eigenvalues of ðZq

dR for any q ∈ Y. We will say that a wedge metric is suitably scaled if

(cid:40){− 1

{− 1

2(v)}

if v is even
if v is odd

specb(ðdR; q) ∩ {ζ : 0 ≤ Re ζ + 1

2(v + 1) ≤ 1} ⊆

partial distributional asymptotic expansion

r1−εH−1

ε>0

These are the indicial roots that come from the null space of ðZ
dR and can not be removed
by scaling the metric. Note that the null space of the indicial operator at these roots is
cohomological, e.g.,
ker(Iq(ðdR;− v

2 )) = Hv/2(Zq) ⊕ Hv/2(Zq) = {harmonic forms on Zq of degree v/2}2,

and so these null spaces ﬁt together to form a bundle over Y, isomorphic to two copies of
the ﬂat bundle described in §3.2.1.

The intuitive analysis about the leading terms of elements in the maximal domain from the
last paragraph can be made precise, but it requires distributional asymptotic expansions [4,
Lemma 2.1], cf. [85, Theorem 7.3], [74, §5], [92]:

where α, β ∈ H−1/2(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y )),

Lemma 3.1. If g is a suitably scaled wedge metric on (cid:101)X, then any ω ∈ Dmax(ðdR) has a
ω ∼ r−v/2(α(ω) + dr ∧ β(ω)) +(cid:101)ω
e ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X))
dR (Z) = 0 (i.e., if (cid:98)X is Witt) then this

(cid:101)ω ∈(cid:92)
expansion is just ω ∼(cid:101)ω and our convention is that α(ω) = β(ω) = 0.
Proposition 3.2. If g is a suitably scaled wedge metric on (cid:101)X and ω ∈ Dmax(ðdR) then
In particular, if (cid:98)X is a Witt space then the minimal and maximal domains of ðdR coincide

in the sense that the L2-pairing of ω with a suﬃciently regular form is equal to the distribu-
tional pairing with this expansion. If v is odd or Hv/2

As anticipated, we can use this lemma to distinguish between the domains of closed ex-

ω ∈ Dmin(ðdR) ⇐⇒ α(ω) = β(ω) = 0.

tensions of ðdR [4, Proposition 2.2].

so we say that ðdR is essentially closed (in fact essentially self-adjoint since this closed
extension will necessarily be self-adjoint). On a non-Witt space, this proposition shows that
domains between the minimal and the maximal are determined by the coeﬃcients α and
β. We can think of these as being Cauchy data on which we can impose ideal boundary
conditions.

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

3.4. Cheeger ideal boundary conditions. Given an element ω ∈ Dmax(ðdR) of the maxi-
mal domain, its ‘Cauchy data’ consists of two distributional sections α(ω), β(ω) of the vector
bundle

Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ) −→ Y.

This vector bundle has a canonical ﬂat structure reviewed in §3.2.1. We say that its sub-
bundle W,

Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y )

W

Y

is a mezzoperversity if it is parallel with respect to the ﬂat connection of Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ). Note
that the bundle Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ) inherits a bundle metric (from the L2 metric on harmonic

forms); we denote the orthogonal complement of W by W ⊥. To each mezzoperversity we
associate Cheeger ideal boundary conditions to deﬁne the domain
DW (ðdR) = {ω ∈ Dmax(ðdR) :

α(ω) ∈ H−1/2(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ W ), β(ω) ∈ H−1/2(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ W ⊥)}.
Note that mezzoperversities always exist: two canonical choices are W = {0} and W =

Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ).

To avoid having to continually distinguish between the Witt and non-Witt cases, let us

adopt the convention of writing the unique closed domain of d + δ on a Witt space by

DW (ðdR)

with W = ∅, and refer to this as the empty mezzoperversity.

Theorem 3.3. Let (cid:98)X be a stratiﬁed space of depth one endowed with a suitably scaled wedge

metric g and let DW (ðdR) ⊆ Dmax(ðdR) be the domain corresponding to a (possibly empty)
mezzoperversity. The operator (ðdR,DW (ðdR)) is closed, self-adjoint, and Fredholm with
compact resolvent, and

DW (ðdR) ⊆(cid:92)

e ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)).

r1/2−εH 1

ε>0

This theorem is proved in [4, §4]. The fact that the domain is closed follows easily from
Lemma 3.1 and continuity of the Cauchy data map. The proof that the operator (ðdR,DW )
is Fredholm and has compact resolvent uses the normal operators Nq(ðdR) deﬁned in §3.2.2.
The domain DW determines a domain for Nq(ðdR) as an unbounded operator on the ap-
propriate L2 space. With this domain Nq(ðdR) is invertible and we can put these inverses
together to construct a parametrix for (ðdR,DW ). This parametrix shows that (ðdR,DW )

is Fredholm and also that DW is compactly contained in L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) which implies

that the resolvent will be compact. Finally the proof of that this operator is self-adjoint in
the non-Witt case follows from facts about domains of d that we will discuss in the next
subsection (Theorem 3.4(iii)).
An important consequence of the theorem is that the null space of (ðdR,DW (ðdR)) is
ﬁnite dimensional. We refer to this null space as the Hodge cohomology with Cheeger ideal

With this theorem we have established the most important analytic properties of ðdR and

Hodge cohomology. We next look for a corresponding de Rham theory.

3.5. De Rham cohomology. The operators d and δ individually deﬁne unbounded oper-

Dmin(d) ⊆ Dmax(d), Dmin(δ) ⊆ Dmax(δ).
Since d and δ are formally adjoint, these domains are related by

(d,Dmin(d))∗ = (δ,Dmax(δ)),

(d,Dmax(d))∗ = (δ,Dmin(δ))

as follows directly from the deﬁnition of adjoint and the distributional action of a diﬀerential
operator.

Given a domain D for d, let us denote

Dp = D ∩ L2((cid:101)X; Λp(wT ∗(cid:101)X)).

It is easy to see that

0 −→ Dmax(d)0

d−−→ Dmax(d)1

Dmax(d) = Dmin(d).

(3.5)

If (cid:98)X is a Witt space, then ðdR is essentially self-adjoint and [31, Lemma 3.8] shows that
dR((cid:98)X) then Theorem 3.3 and [31,
Consider next the situation when (cid:98)X is not a Witt space. Since d is not elliptic, we can not
expansion at (cid:101)X. However there is a way around this using the Kodaira decomposition (see,
L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) = d(Dmin(d)) ⊕ δ(Dmax(δ)) ⊕ ker(d,Dmin(d)) ∩ ker(δ,Dmax(δ)).

expect arbitrary elements in the maximal domain of d to have a distributional asymptotic
e.g., [31, Lemma 2.1]) corresponding to (d,Dmin(d)),

dR((cid:98)X) ∼= Hp((cid:98)X).

Hp

Given ω ∈ Dmax(d), let ωδ be the projection onto δ(Dmax(δ)), and notice that

so (d + δ)ωδ ∈ L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) and hence

dωδ = dω,

δωδ = 0,

ωδ ∈ Dmax(ðdR).

In particular Lemma 3.1 determines Cauchy data α(ωδ) and β(ωδ), and given a mezzo-
perversity W we deﬁne

DW (d) = {ω ∈ Dmax(d) : α(ωδ) ∈ H−1/2(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ W )}.

It turns out that [4, Lemma 5.3]

α((dω)δ) = ∇Hα(ωδ)

where ∇H is the ﬂat connection on Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ), and hence the fact that W is a ﬂat bundle

i) DW (d) is the closure of DW (ðdR) with respect to the graph norm of d.
ii) If ω ∈ Dmax(δ) and ωd is its projection onto d(Dmax(d)) then ωd is an element of

DW (δ) = {ω ∈ Dmax(δ) : β(ωd) ∈ H−1/2(Y ; Λ•T ∗Y ⊗ W ⊥).

iii) DW (ðdR) = DW (d) ∩ DW (δ) and hence

Directly from the deﬁnition of the ﬂat connection ∇H we see that
dQ(η, ω) = Q(∇Hη, ω) ± Q(η,∇Hω).

This shows that if W −→ Y is a ﬂat subbundle of Hv/2(∂(cid:101)X/Y ) and DW −→ Y is the

Q-orthogonal complement of W, then DW is also a ﬂat subbundle. We call DW the dual
mezzoperversity to W. We can rewrite Q using the Hodge star (on Z) and see that

DW = ∗W ⊥.

In turn this makes it easy to see that the Hodge star deﬁnes a map

∗ : DW (ðdR) −→ DDW (ðdR)

and that B descends to non-degenerate pairing on cohomology,

W,dR((cid:98)X) × H•

which is a generalization of Poincar´e duality to this setting.

If W = DW we say that W is a self-dual mezzoperversity. There are topological obstruc-
tions to the existence of a self-dual mezzoperversity, for example the existence of a self-dual
mezzoperversity implies that the signature of the link Z vanishes. If a space admits a self-
dual mezzoperversity (or is a Witt space) then we say that it is a Cheeger space. If W is
a self-dual mezzoperversity then B descends to a non degenerate form on H•
these groups satisfy Poincar´e duality and deﬁne a signature.

W,dR((cid:98)X) and so

In §5.3 we will explain why this signature is independent of the choice of self-dual mezzo-
perversity and hence only depends on the Cheeger space. Also in this section we describe
this signature as the Fredholm index of the signature operator with an appropriate domain.

4. General stratified spaces

Now we consider the general case where (cid:98)X is a union of several smooth manifolds,
For simplicity let us assume that, for each k, the closure Y k of Yk in (cid:98)X is (cid:98)Yk = Yk ∪ Yk+1 ∪
is that there is a single chain of strata. The points of depth zero, Y0, form (cid:98)X reg, the regular
part of (cid:98)X, while the other strata form the singular part of (cid:98)X. We denote the link of (cid:98)X at
points in Yk by (cid:98)Zk, these are themselves stratiﬁed spaces (of depth k − 1). We denote the

. . .∪ Y(cid:96). It is always true that the closure of a stratum is a union of strata, so our assumption

(cid:98)X = Y0 ∪ Y1 ∪ . . . ∪ Y(cid:96).

dimensions of these spaces by

n = dim (cid:98)X reg,

hk = dim Yk,

vk = dim(cid:98)Z reg

k .

Note that hk is a decreasing function of k. We assume throughout that all strata and links
are connected. (Neither of these assumptions is signiﬁcant and they mainly serve to simplify
the notation.)

for our purposes, explain how to resolve (cid:98)X to a smooth manifold with corners (cid:101)X. For

In Section 6 we will recall the precise deﬁnition of a stratiﬁed space and, more importantly

now we content ourselves with describing the structure of the resolved space where our
analysis is carried out. The resolved structure is called a boundary ﬁbration structure. The

correspondence with the singular strata. Indeed, each Mk is the total space of a ﬁber bundle,

boundary hypersurfaces of (cid:101)X, which we denote M1, . . . , M(cid:96), are embedded and in one to one
with base (cid:101)Yk the resolution of Y k, and typical ﬁber (cid:101)Zk, the resolution of (cid:98)Zk. If Mj ∩ Mk (cid:54)= ∅,

a rigid wedge metric by ðdR = d+δ. Its minimal and maximal domains Dmin(ðdR), Dmax(ðdR)
are deﬁned just as in the case of a single singular stratum.
Our plan will be to study ðdR one stratum at a time. For this purpose, a useful class of

functions on (cid:101)X is given by
kC∞((cid:101)Yk)}.
Note that any such function descends to a continuous function on (cid:98)X, so we can think of
Φ ((cid:101)X) then df extends from
Φ ((cid:101)X) as providing a notion of smooth function on (cid:98)X. If f ∈ C∞
(cid:101)X◦ to a smooth section of wT ∗(cid:101)X and this can be used to show

Φ ((cid:101)X) ( [1, Lemma 5.2]). This allows us to focus on elements of Dmax(ðdR) supported on a
distinguished neighborhood of a point in a singular stratum q ∈ Yk = (cid:101)Y ◦

carried out in §3. Thus if g is suitably scaled then u has a partial distributional asymptotic
expansion as in Lemma 3.1. If Y1 is not a Witt stratum then we choose W1, a ﬂat subbundle
of Hv/2(M1/Y1), and we deﬁne
Dmax,W1(ðdR) = {u ∈ Dmax(ðdR) :

If Y1 is a Witt stratum, then there is no need to choose boundary conditions at Y1. For
notational consistency, when Y1 is a Witt stratum we set W1 = ∅ and deﬁne Dmax,W1(ðdR) =
Dmax(ðdR).

Having chosen W1, we can apply Theorem 3.3 (or rather its proof) and see that

domains for d and δ by

DW(d) = d-graph closure of DW(ðdR), DW(δ) = δ-graph closure of DW(ðdR).

To see that these form complexes and that their intersection is DW(ðdR), it is important to
characterize these domains in terms of distributional asymptotic expansions.

Let Y be a stratum of (cid:98)X of depth k, and assume inductively that we have carried out the

analysis of Hodge and de Rham cohomology on all space of depth less than k. The domain

Dmax,(W1,...,Wk−1)(d)

forms a Hilbert complex and so we have a Kodaira decomposition

L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) = d(Dmax,(W1,...,Wk−1)(d)) ⊕ δ(Dmax,(W1,...,Wk−1)(d)∗)

Given ω ∈ Dmax,(W1,...,Wk−1)(d), let ωδ denote the orthogonal projection onto the second

ωδ ∈ Dmax,(W1,...,Wk−1)(ðdR).

5. Properties of cohomology

5.1. Metric independence of de Rham cohomology. Our deﬁnition of a mezzoperversity
uses Hodge cohomology groups and hence is metric dependent. In this section we will explain
how to deﬁne mezzoperversities in a metric-independent way, and why this leads to metric
independent de Rham cohomology groups. For this section we will incorporate the metric
into the notation of the domain, e.g.,

To start with, note that if g and g(cid:48) are two iterated wedge metrics on the same pseudo-

manifold (cid:98)X then they both induce bundle metrics on wT ∗(cid:101)X over (cid:101)X and, since (cid:101)X is compact,

Dmax(d; g).

these must be quasi-isometric. That is, there is a positive constant C such that

It follows that L2 norms deﬁned by g and g(cid:48) on C∞

L2((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X))

Cg(·,·) ≤ g(cid:48)(·,·) ≤ 1

c ((cid:101)X; Λ•(wT ∗(cid:101)X)) are equivalent and hence

as a set is independent of the choice of metric and inherits equivalent norms from g and g(cid:48).
Then directly from the deﬁnitions of the minimal and maximal domains we see that

this shows that its de Rham cohomology is independent of the choice of metric.

Dmin(d; g) = Dmin(d; g(cid:48)), Dmax(d; g) = Dmax(d; g(cid:48))

so we can denote these unambiguously as Dmin(d) and Dmax(d). If (cid:98)X is a Witt space, then
ﬁrst assume that (cid:98)X is a pseudomanifold of depth one and adopt the notation of Section

For domains deﬁned by Cheeger ideal boundary conditions, we proceed inductively. So
3. A mezzoperversity is a ﬂat subbundle W of Hv/2(M/Y ) −→ Y and hence depends on
the metric. Let us emphasize this by referring to W as a Hodge mezzoperversity or even
a g-Hodge mezzoperversity. Analogously a de Rham mezzoperversity will refer to a ﬂat
dR (M/Y ) −→ Y. Using the Hodge isomorphism on the smooth manifold Z,
subbundle of Hv/2
we can associate a de Rham mezzoperversity to each Hodge mezzoperversity. We denote the
de Rham mezzoperversity corresponding to W by [W ]. The advantage is that the bundle
dR (M/Y ) −→ Y and, from §3.2.1 its ﬂat connection, are deﬁned independently of the
Hv/2
metric. Thus it makes sense to compare the two domains,
D[W ](d; g) and D[W ](d; g(cid:48)).

Consider the subspace Dreg
asymptotic expansion near Y,

max(d) ⊆ Dmax(d) consisting of wedge diﬀerential forms with an

χω = r−v/2(α(ω) + dr ∧ β(ω)) +(cid:101)ω, for all χ ∈ A(Y ),

where(cid:101)ω ∈ Dmin(d) and α(ω), β(ω) are smooth diﬀerential forms deﬁned near ∂(cid:101)X, of vertical

degree v/2, in the null space of dZ. This decomposition when it exists is not unique, since
elements of Dmin(d) may themselves have asymptotic expansions, but one can show that the
de Rham cohomology class of α(ω) is well-deﬁned. It turns out [4, §5] that Dreg
max(d) is dense
in Dmax(d) with respect to the graph norm of d, and

Dreg
[W ](d; g) = D[W ](d, g) ∩ Dreg

max(d)

30

PIERRE ALBIN

is dense in D[W ](d; g) with respect to the graph norm of d. Moreover, if ω is in Dreg
max(d) then
ω ∈ D[W ](d) precisely when the vertical de Rham cohomology class of α(ω) as a section over
Y is in [W ]. Thus Dreg
[W ](d; g(cid:48)) and, since taking the closure in L2 with respect
to g is the same as taking the closure with respect to g(cid:48), we have
D[W ](d; g) = D[W ](d; g(cid:48)).

[W ](d; g) = Dreg

It follows that on a pseudomanifold of depth one, the domain of the exterior derivative
corresponding to a de Rham mezzoperversity is independent of the choice of rigid suitably
scaled wedge metric and hence

[W ],dR((cid:98)X) is independent of the choice of g.

This is proved in [4, Theorem 5.4], we do not go into the details as in the next section we

5.2. Stratiﬁed homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology. If X and N are smooth
closed manifolds and F : X −→ N is a smooth homotopy equivalence between them, then
F deﬁnes a pull-back map of diﬀerential forms that commutes with the exterior derivative.
Thus F ∗ descends to a map on de Rham cohomology which is necessarily an isomorphism,

We want to prove an analogous statement for the L2-de Rham cohomology of a pseudoman-
ifold corresponding to a mezzoperversity.

One problem is that, even on smooth Riemannian manifolds, the pull-back by a smooth
homotopy equivalence need not induce a bounded map on L2-diﬀerential forms. For example,
if F is an embedding and uε ∈ C∞(N ) is the indicator function of an ε-ball around F (X),
then the L2-norm of uε goes to zero with ε, while F ∗uε = 1 has constant L2 norm. Thus

F ∗ : { step functions } ⊆ L2(N ) −→ L2(X)

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

31

is not even closable. There is a clever way around this, developed by Hilsum-Skandalis [59]
for smooth manifolds, and extended in [3, 5] to pseudomanifolds. We replace F ∗ by a map
on L2-diﬀerential forms called the Hilsum-Skandalis replacement and denoted HS(F ).

First let us explain our assumptions on maps between stratiﬁed spaces. By a smooth map

between stratiﬁed spaces we mean a continuous map (cid:98)F : (cid:98)X −→ (cid:98)N that lifts to a smooth map
between the resolutions of the stratiﬁed spaces, F : (cid:101)X −→ (cid:101)N . Equivalently, these are the
smooth maps (cid:101)X −→ (cid:101)N such that

We denote these maps by

We say that (cid:98)F ∈ C∞((cid:98)X, (cid:98)N ) is stratum-preserving if the inverse image of a stratum is a union
of strata, and strongly stratum preserving if the codimension of a stratum of (cid:98)N coincides
with the codimension of its inverse image in (cid:98)X. We say that (cid:98)F ∈ C∞((cid:98)X, (cid:98)N ) is a stratiﬁed
homotopy equivalence if there is a smooth strongly stratum preserving map (cid:98)G ∈ C∞((cid:98)N , (cid:98)X)
such that (cid:98)F ◦ (cid:98)G and (cid:98)G ◦ (cid:98)F are smoothly connected to the identity through smooth strongly

stratum preserving maps.

We will assign a Hilsum-Skandalis replacement HS(F ) to a smooth strongly stratum
preserving map. These replacements will descend to cohomology and only depend on the
homotopy class of F within smooth strongly stratum preserving maps. The construction of
HS(F ) is slightly complicated, but the main idea is that we want to ‘spread out’ the image
of F to avoid precisely the sort of counterexample above. In [59] this ‘spreading out’ is done
by embedding N into a Euclidean space and averaging among nearby points. We will do
something similar using the geodesic ﬂow of a wedge metric.

but as mentioned above, this map need not be bounded in L2. To construct a replacement,

let us start with wB(cid:101)N πN−−−→ (cid:101)N , the ball subbundle of the dual bundle to wT ∗(cid:101)N , wT (cid:101)N −→ (cid:101)N ,

wedge metric from (cid:101)N◦ to (cid:101)N . Then we set

One of the most important properties of the signature of a smooth manifold is that it is
unchanged under oriented bordism. That is, if X and N are oriented smooth manifolds, and
there is an oriented smooth manifold with boundary M such that

∂M = X (cid:116) (−N ),

with collared boundary,

then sign(X) = sign(N ).

(cid:98)X and (cid:98)N , respectively. A bordism between ((cid:98)X, W(cid:98)X) and ((cid:98)N , W(cid:98)N ) is a Cheeger space (cid:99)M
Now suppose that W(cid:98)X, W(cid:98)N are self-dual mezzoperversities on the oriented Cheeger spaces
together with a mezzoperversity W (cid:99)M that restricts to W(cid:98)X in a collar of (cid:98)X and restricts to
W(cid:98)N in a collar of (cid:98)N . By showing that the signature operator of a Cheeger space deﬁnes a
Proposition 5.6. If there is a bordism between ((cid:98)X, W(cid:98)X) and ((cid:98)N , W(cid:98)N ) then

K-homology class and then applying K-homology theory, we proved in [5, Theorem 4.7] the
bordism invariance of the signature.

∂ (cid:99)M = (cid:98)X (cid:116) (−(cid:98)N )

sign((cid:98)X, W(cid:98)X) = sign((cid:98)N , W(cid:98)N ).

A clever observation of Banal [11] (in the context of L-spaces and self-dual sheaves, cf. [5,
Theorem 4.8]) is that any two mezzoperversities on a single Cheeger space are bordant. Thus
this proposition shows that the signature of a Cheeger space is independent of the choice of
self-dual mezzoperversity! We can restate the results so far in a more satisfying fashion:

Theorem 5.7. The signature of an oriented Cheeger space is unchanged under stratiﬁed
homotopy equivalences or Cheeger space bordism.

5.4. L-class and higher signatures. Let (cid:98)X be a Cheeger space, W a self-dual mezzo-
that (cid:98)X can be embedded into Rm for m (cid:29) 1 and any
F : (cid:98)X −→ S2q

perversity, and let S(cid:96) denote the (cid:96)-dimensional sphere. Goresky-MacPherson [53] showed

can be arranged via homotopy to be the restriction of a map deﬁned on all of Rm and to be
transverse to a given point pt ∈ S2q.
Lemma 5.8. The inverse image of pt under F is a Cheeger space and hence has a signature.
Homotopic maps produce cobordant Cheeger spaces and hence the same signature.

A trick due to Thom [108, 110] uses this construction to deﬁne an L-class in homology.

Namely, if 4q > n + 1, then we have

and so we have a map

H2q((cid:98)X; Q) ∼= [(cid:98)X, S2q] ⊗ Q
H2q((cid:98)X; Q)

which deﬁnes an element in H2q((cid:98)X; Q). If 4q ≤ n + 1, we choose any (cid:96) > n + 1 such that
4(q + (cid:96)) > n + (cid:96) + 1, and then (cid:98)X × S2(cid:96) is a Cheeger space and
H2q+2(cid:96)((cid:98)X × S2(cid:96); Q) ∼= H2q((cid:98)X; Q)

35

so we can proceed as before.

The homology class deﬁned in this way is called the L-class and denoted

L((cid:98)X) ∈ Heven((cid:98)X; Q).
Now let r : (cid:98)X −→ Bπ1(cid:98)X be the classifying map for the universal cover of (cid:98)X. The higher
signatures of (cid:98)X are deﬁned to be the rational numbers
where (cid:104)·,·(cid:105) denotes the pairing between cohomology and homology of Bπ1(cid:98)X.
The Novikov conjecture for (cid:98)X is the statement that the higher signatures are stratiﬁed
homotopy invariant (see, e.g., [100]). The strong Novikov conjecture for π1(cid:98)X states that an

{(cid:104)γ, r∗L((cid:98)X)(cid:105) : γ ∈ H•(Bπ1(cid:98)X; Q)}

‘assembly map’ between two K-homology groups is rationally injective. The latter conjecture
is known for many classes of groups. The analytic approach to the Novikov conjecture is
to use index theory to ‘reduce’ it to the strong Novikov conjecture. This reduces stratiﬁed
homotopy invariance to the homotopy invariance of the index of a ‘higher’ signature operator
and, by using the Hilsum-Skandalis replacement construction, we were able to prove this
analytically on both the Witt and Cheeger space settings. (For Witt spaces the index of this
higher signature can also be computed topologically, at least after changing coeﬃcients to
Q, as a ‘symmetric signature.’ There are now two constructions of the symmetric signature
of a Witt space, [13,46], and the latter is stratiﬁed homotopy invariant.) In [5, Theorem 5.8]
we carry out the analytic approach to the Novikov conjecture for Cheeger spaces.

Theorem 5.9. Let (cid:98)X be a Cheeger space. If the strong Novikov conjecture is true for π1X,
then the higher signatures of (cid:98)X are stratiﬁed homotopy invariants.

5.5. Reﬁned intersection (co)homology. In this subsection we explain a ‘de Rham the-
orem’ showing that the de Rham cohomology groups deﬁned analytically above have sheaf-
theroretic descriptions. Thus we will shift gears and work more topologically. We will show
that the cohomology corresponding to a mezzoperversity lies ‘in between’ the two middle per-
versities. To make this precise we will ﬁrst recall the sheaf-theoretic approach to intersection
homology.

It is convenient to use a notation that emphasizes dimension as opposed to depth. So

given (cid:98)X, an n-dimensional pseudomanifold, let

∅ = X−1 ⊆ X0 ⊆ . . . ⊆ Xn−2 ⊆ Xn = (cid:98)X

be an increasing sequence of closed subsets such that the stratum

Sk = Xk \ Xk−1

is either empty or a smooth manifold of dimension k. The regular part of (cid:98)X is equal to
Sn = (cid:98)X \ Xn−2. Let
be the increasing sequence of open subsets of (cid:98)X, starting with V2 = Sn = (cid:98)X reg and satisfying

Vk = (cid:98)X \ Xn−k

Vk+1 = Vk ∪ Sn−k.

associated to it a derived sheaf: the sheaﬁﬁcation of the presheaf

Let Sh((cid:98)X) denote the category of sheaves of R-vector spaces on (cid:98)X. A constructible diﬀer-
ential graded sheaf is a complex A• such that A•|Sk has locally constant cohomology sheaves
ential graded sheaves by Sh•((cid:98)X). The derived category of bounded constructible complexes,
D((cid:98)X), has as objects the cochain complexes of bounded constructible sheaves but quasi-
and has ﬁnitely generated stalk cohomology. We denote the category of constructible diﬀer-

The sheaf theoretic formulation of intersection cohomology in [54] assigns to each perversity

Now let us modify this theory to admit mezzoperverisites. Say that a constructible

and so is a reﬁnement of Deligne’s construction in which we truncate the cohomology not
just at a given degree but at a given locally constant sheaf. We prove [1, Theorem 2.2]
that every reﬁned middle perversity complex of sheaves is given by IC•
L for some topological
mezzoperversity L.

Now endow (cid:98)X with a rigid suitably scaled iterated wedge metric g, and let W be a de
Rham mezzoperversity. Deﬁne a presheaf on (cid:98)X by assigning to each open set U ⊆ (cid:98)X the

DW(U) = {ω ∈ DW(d) : supp ω ⊆ (U ∩ (cid:98)X reg)}

vector space

and assigning to each inclusion j : U ⊆ V the restriction map

j∗ : DW(V) −→ DW(U).

The exterior derivative makes this into a complex of presheaves. Denote the sheaﬁﬁcation
by

PIERRE ALBIN

Theorem 5.10. Let (cid:98)X be a pseudomanifold endowed with a rigid suitably scaled iterated
RP ((cid:98)X), and hence we have an equality in D((cid:98)X),
wedge metric. Given any de Rham mezzoperversity W, the sheaf L2WΩ• deﬁnes an object in
L2WΩ• ∼= IC•

for some topological mezzoperversity L(W). This establishes a one-to-one correspondence
between de Rham mezzoperversities and topological mezzoperversities

L(W)

W ↔ L(W).

Thus we have an equivalence between the hypercohomology of a reﬁned middle perversity
complex of sheaves and the L2-de Rham cohomology with Cheeger ideal boundary conditions,

W,dR((cid:98)X) = H•((cid:98)X; IC•

H∗

L(W)).

On any pseudomanifold there are two canonical choices of mezzoperversity. Indeed, given
a ﬂat bundle H −→ Y, two canonical ﬂat subbundles are the zero bundle and the entire
bundle H itself. Let W0 be the mezzoperversity corresponding to always choosing the zero
bundle, and Wmax the mezzoperversity corresponding to always choosing the entire bundle
of vertical cohomology. This theorem shows that

W0,dR((cid:98)X) = IH∗

m((cid:98)X), H∗

Wmax,dR((cid:98)X) = IH∗

n((cid:98)X).

H∗

(The latter can be identiﬁed with the cohomology of Dmax(d) and the former with the
cohomology of Dmin(d), so in these cases the isomorphisms follow from the work of Cheeger
described in §2.)

The deﬁnition of RP ((cid:98)X) only requires a topological stratiﬁcation. In this generality, in [10],
Banagl studied a category SD((cid:98)X) deﬁned just like RP ((cid:98)X) but with the extra requirement
of self-duality. Spaces (cid:98)X with SD((cid:98)X) non-empty are called L-spaces. We show in [1] that a

Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space is an L-space if and only if it is a Cheeger space.

6. Stratified spaces and their resolutions

In this section we will review the relation between stratiﬁed spaces and manifolds with

corners.

6.1. Thom-Mather stratiﬁed spaces. We follow [83, 114], see also [97]. Our aim in this
section is to discuss the deﬁnition and some basic concepts culminating in the ‘local cone
structure’ of a Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space.

All topological spaces will be ‘nice’ meaning Hausdorﬀ, locally compact topological space
with a countable basis for its topology. A subset A of a topological space V is locally closed
if every point a ∈ A has a neighborhood U in V such that A ∩ U is closed in U. A collection
S of subsets of V is locally ﬁnite if every point v ∈ V has a neighborhood that intersects
only ﬁnitely many sets in S.

Deﬁnition 1. A (Thom-Mather) stratiﬁed space is a triple ((cid:98)X, S , T ) in which (cid:98)X is the
space, S is a decomposition of (cid:98)X into ‘strata’, and T is a collection of ‘tubes’, one per

stratum. Speciﬁcally:

• (cid:98)X is a ‘nice’ topological space.

• S is a locally ﬁnite collection of locally closed subsets of (cid:98)X. Each Y ∈ S is a

39

topological manifold in the induced topology and is provided with a smooth structure.
The family S satisﬁes the frontier condition

Y, Y (cid:48) ∈ S and Y ∩ Y (cid:48) (cid:54)= ∅ =⇒ Y ⊆ Y (cid:48).

(6.1)

• T contains, for each Y ∈ S , a triple (TY , πY , ρY ) in which TY is an open neighbor-

hood of Y in (cid:98)X, and
TY is known as a tubular neighborhood of Y in (cid:98)X and the triple (TY , πY , ρY ) as the
control data of Y in (cid:98)X.

πY : TY −→ Y,
are continuous functions such that πY

Y (0) = Y. The neighborhood

ρY : TY −→ R+

(cid:12)(cid:12)Y = idY and ρ−1

The control data are compatible in that if Y, Y (cid:48) ∈ S are distinct strata such that TY ∩ Y (cid:48) (cid:54)= ∅
then

(πY , ρY )(cid:12)(cid:12)TY ∩Y (cid:48) : TY ∩ Y (cid:48) −→ Y × (0,∞)

(6.2)

is a smooth submersion, and

πY ◦ πY (cid:48) = πY ,
(6.3)
when both sides are deﬁned (i.e., on TY ∩ π−1

ρY ◦ πY (cid:48) = ρY

Y (cid:48) (TY ∩ Y (cid:48))).

A stratiﬁed space is a pseudomanifold if the codimension of each singular stratum is at

least two.

If ((cid:98)X, S , T ) is a stratiﬁed space and L is a smooth manifold then (cid:98)X × L is naturally a
If ((cid:98)X, S , T ) is a stratiﬁed space and A ⊆ (cid:98)X is either an open subset or a closed subset

stratiﬁed space with strata Y × L, Y ∈ S .
that is a union of strata, then A is naturally a stratiﬁed space with strata Y ∩ A, Y ∈ S .
Example 10 (Whitney stratiﬁed spaces). Let L be a smooth manifold and let R, S be smooth
submanifolds of L. We say that (R, S) satisﬁes Whitney’s condition (B) if for every

• x ∈ R
• sequence (yk) ⊆ S such that yk → x and TykS → τ ⊆ TxL (as sections of a Grass-
manian bundle over L),
• sequence (xk) ⊆ R such that xk → x, xk (cid:54)= yk and the secant lines xkyk (deﬁned in a
coordinate chart) converge to (cid:96) ⊆ TxL

we have (cid:96) ⊆ τ.
A Whitney stratiﬁcation of a subset A ⊆ L is a locally ﬁnite collection S of pairwise
disjoint smooth submanifolds of L covering A, such that any Y, Y (cid:48) ∈ S satisfy the frontier
condition (6.1) and Whitney’s condition (B). Spaces admitting a Whitney stratiﬁcation in-
clude algebraic subvarieties of Rn or Cn [117], semianalytic and sub analytic sets [80], and
‘o-minimal structures’ [113].

Whitney stratiﬁed spaces are intimately connected to Thom-Mather stratiﬁed spaces. Mather
proved [83] that every Whitney stratiﬁed space admits a Thom-Mather stratiﬁcation. More-
over, Teufel [107] showed that every Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space can be embedded into a
Euclidean space so that its image is Whitney stratiﬁed.

PIERRE ALBIN

Given Y, Y (cid:48) ∈ S we write

Y < Y (cid:48) ⇐⇒ Y ∩ Y (cid:48) (cid:54)= ∅ ⇐⇒ Y ⊆ Y (cid:48).

This is an order on S and (6.2) shows that Y < Y (cid:48) =⇒ dim Y < dim Y (cid:48). Another useful
consequence of (6.1) is that the closure of a stratum is a union of strata. Indeed, this is
equivalent to the frontier condition (6.1).

The depth of a stratum is

depth(Y ) = sup{n ∈ N0 : ∃Yi ∈ S s.t. Y = Y0 < Y1 < . . . < Yn}

and the depth of a stratiﬁcation is

depth(S ) = sup{depth(Y ) : Y ∈ S }.

The regular part of (cid:98)X consists of those strata of depth zero,
(cid:91){Y ∈ S : depth(Y ) = 0}.
Two stratiﬁed spaces ((cid:98)X, S , T ) and ((cid:98)X(cid:48), S (cid:48), T (cid:48)) are equivalent if (cid:98)X = (cid:98)X(cid:48) with the same

(see also [83, Corollary 10.2, Proposition 11.1], [97, 3.9.2]).
The main tool in the proof of Theorem 6.1 is the notion of a controlled vector ﬁeld on a
stratiﬁed space (see [83, §9], [114, §2]). A collection of smooth vector ﬁelds, one per stratum,

ξ = {ξY ∈ C∞(Y, T Y ) : Y ∈ S }

is a controlled vector ﬁeld if whenever Y, Y (cid:48) ∈ S , Y < Y (cid:48), and ζ ∈ TY ∩ Y (cid:48) is suﬃciently
close to Y,

DπY (ξY (cid:48)(ζ)) = ξY (πY (ζ)),

ξY (cid:48)ρY = 0.

These are analogous to smooth vector ﬁelds on a smooth manifold in at least two ways: First,
the ﬂow of a controlled vector ﬁeld generates a (local) one parameter group of stratiﬁed space

morphisms from an open subset Dξ ⊆ (cid:98)X × R to (cid:98)X. Secondly, if L is a smooth manifold and
f : (cid:98)X −→ L is a submersive morphism, then every vector ﬁeld on L has a lift to a controlled

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

Hence for many purposes working on (cid:98)X is equivalent to working on [(cid:98)X; (cid:98)X∗] together with
its boundary ﬁbration ψ(cid:98)X∗. The resolution of (cid:98)X is the result of iterating this process to

replace strata by boundaries.
6.3. Stratiﬁcations with collared corners. In this section we summarize part of §5
of [114] (where the terminology ‘abstract stratiﬁcations with faces’ is used). By a man-
ifold with corners we mean a smooth manifold locally modeled on (R+)(cid:96) with embedded
boundary hypersurfaces, e.g., see [89]. (For notational convenience, we allow the empty set
as a boundary hypersurface.) A manifold with corners always has (compatible) collar neigh-
borhoods of its boundary hypersurfaces (see e.g., [6, Proposition 1.2]). By a manifold with
collared corners we mean that we have ﬁxed a choice of collars.

Deﬁnition 2. A stratiﬁed space with collared corners is a quintuple ((cid:98)X, S , T , F , C ) in
which (cid:98)X is the space, S is a decomposition of (cid:98)X into ‘strata’, T is a collection of ‘tubes’,
one per stratum, F are the ‘boundary hypersurfaces’ of (cid:98)X, and C is a collection of ‘collars’,
• (cid:98)X is a ‘nice’ topological space.
• F is a collection of closed subsets of (cid:98)X and S is a locally ﬁnite collection of locally
closed subsets of (cid:98)X.
• C consists, for each K ∈ F , of an open neighborhood UK ⊆ (cid:98)X of K and a homeo-

one per boundary hypersurface. Speciﬁcally:

morphism

such that ΘK

(cid:12)(cid:12)K = idK, and

ΘK : UK −→ K × R+

ΘK(Y ∩ UK) ⊆ (Y ∩ K) × R+ for every Y ∈ S .

The pair (UK, ΘK) is known as a collar of K. We denote the composition of ΘK with
the projection onto K by θK and the composition with the projection onto R+ by xK,
so that

ΘK(ζ) = (θK(ζ), xk(ζ)).

• Each Y ∈ S is a topological manifold with boundary in the induced topology and
is provided with the structure of a smooth manifold with corners whose boundary
hypersurfaces are Y ∩ K for K ∈ F . These are collared by ΘK∩Y = ΘK
. The
family S satisﬁes the frontier condition

Y, Y (cid:48) ∈ S and Y ∩ Y (cid:48) (cid:54)= ∅ =⇒ Y ⊆ Y (cid:48).

• T contains, for each Y ∈ S , a triple (TY , πY , ρY ) in which TY is an open neighbor-

hood of Y in (cid:98)X, and
TY is known as a tubular neighborhood of Y in (cid:98)X and the triple (TY , πY , ρY ) as the
control data of Y in (cid:98)X.

The control data are compatible in that if Y, Y (cid:48) ∈ S are distinct strata such that TY ∩ Y (cid:48) (cid:54)= ∅
then

Y (0) = Y. The neighborhood

The depth, dimension, and regular part of a stratiﬁed space with collared corners are
deﬁned as before. The interior of a stratiﬁed space with collared corners is the complement
of the boundary hypersurfaces and is itself a stratiﬁed space.

strata are Y × L, Y ∈ S , and its boundary hypersurfaces are K × L◦, K ∈ F , and (cid:98)X◦ × H,

the control data coincide in a neighborhood of each stratum, and the collar data coincide in
a neighborhood of each boundary hypersurface. Up to equivalence we can assume that

If ((cid:98)X, SX, TX, FX, CX) and ((cid:98)N , SN , TN , FN , CN ) are stratiﬁed spaces with collared cor-

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

A continuous map f : (cid:98)X −→ (cid:98)N is a morphism between stratiﬁed spaces with collared corners,
((cid:98)X, SX, TX, FX, CX) and ((cid:98)N , SN , TN , FN , CN ), if it is compatible with faces, sends strata

to strata smoothly and intertwines control data (as in §6.1). A morphism is submersive if
its restriction to each stratum is a submersion. A morphism is an isomorphism if it is a
bijection and a morphism whose inverse is a morphism.
For example, if Y, Y (cid:48) are strata of a stratiﬁed space with collared corners with Y < Y (cid:48)
then, after potentially shrinking TY , the maps

45

(cid:12)(cid:12)TY ∩Y (cid:48) : TY ∩ Y (cid:48) −→ R

ρY

(cid:12)(cid:12)TY ∩Y (cid:48) : TY ∩ Y (cid:48) −→ Y,

πY

are compatible with faces, with all of the faces being vertical for πY and horizontal for ρY .
If K is a boundary hypersurface of a stratiﬁed space with collared corners and (UK, ΘK)
is its collar then, after potentially shrinking UK, the collar map

ΘK : UK −→ K × R+

is an isomorphism of stratiﬁed spaces with collared corners.

The notions of trivial ﬁbration and locally trivial ﬁbration are entirely analogous to §6.1.

Theorem 6.2 (Thom’s ﬁrst isotopy lemma for stratiﬁed spaces with collared corners [114,

Corollary 5.8]). If f : (cid:98)X −→ L is a proper submersive morphism between a stratiﬁed space
with collared corners (cid:98)X and a smooth manifold with collared corners L, then f is a locally

trivial ﬁbration.

Proceeding as in §6.1, Thom’s ﬁrst isotopy lemma applied to the control data of a stratiﬁed
space with collared boundary implies that such a space is, locally near each stratum, a
bundle of cones over simpler stratiﬁed space with collared boundary. As anticipated above,
this structure allows us to iterate the radial blow-up construction from §6.2. Starting from
a stratiﬁed space, blowing-up the strata of greatest depth produces a stratiﬁed space with
collared boundary, and iterating produces a stratiﬁed space with collared corners. For spaces
of ﬁnite depth this leads to what Verona called a ‘total decomposition’ [114, §6.3.1] and we
call a resolution [3, 6].

6.4. The resolution of a stratiﬁed space. In [3], we used Verona’s constructions to prove
an equivalence between the class of Thom-Mather stratiﬁed spaces and the class of manifolds
with corners and iterated ﬁbration structures, as introduced by Melrose. This resolution is
already claimed in Thom [111] but was not phrased in this way. As explained above, we have
found the presentation of a stratiﬁed space as a manifold with corners and iterated ﬁbration
structures very useful for carrying out analysis.

By a collective boundary hypersurface we mean a ﬁnite union of non-intersecting boundary

hypersurfaces.

Deﬁnition 3 (Melrose [3,6]). A manifold with corners with an iterated ﬁbration structure if
a triple (L, F , Φ) where L is a smooth manifold with corners, F consists of disjoint collective
boundary hypersurfaces with every boundary hypersurface of L occurring in some element of
F , and Φ is a collection of locally trivial ﬁbrations, one per element H ∈ F ,

where ZH and YH are smooth manifolds with corners. These satisfy:

ZH — H

φH−−−→ YH

46

PIERRE ALBIN

• If H, K ∈ F intersect then dim YH (cid:54)= dim YK and we write

H < K if dim YH < dim YK.

• if H < K then YK has a collective boundary hypersurface YHK participating in a ﬁber

bundle φHK : YHK −→ YH such that the diagram

H ∩ K

φH

commutes.

Two useful properties of these structures are: (a) a manifold with corners and an iterated
ﬁbration structure admits collar neighborhoods compatible with the boundary ﬁbrations,
see [6, Proposition 3.7], and (b) the bases of the boundary ﬁbrations inherit iterated ﬁbration
structures [6, Lemma 3.4].

If L is a smooth manifold with corners and H is a boundary hypersurface then, since H

is embedded, there exists a smooth function

xH : L −→ [0, 1]

with H = x−1
deﬁning function for H.

H ({0}) such that dxH has no zeroes on H. We call any such a function a boundary
Let L and M be smooth manifolds with corners and let {xHi}, {(cid:101)xGj} be complete sets of

deﬁning functions for the boundary hypersurfaces of L and M respectively. A smooth map
f : L −→ M is a b-map if for each boundary hypersurface Gj ⊆ M,

(cid:89)

f∗(cid:101)xGj = aGj

either f∗(cid:101)xGj = 0 or
with aGj ∈ C∞(L, (0,∞)) and e(i, j) ∈ N0.

,

The ﬁrst alternative occurs only if f (L) ⊆ ∂M, in which case we say that f is a boundary
b-map; otherwise we say that f is an interior b-map.

A morphism between manifolds with corners and boundary ﬁbration structures, (L, FL, ΦL)

and (M, FM , ΦM ) is a b-map

f : L −→ M

that sends the collective boundary hypersurface in FL to collective boundary hypersurfaces
in FM such that, whenever H ∈ FL and G ∈ FM are such that f (H) ⊆ G, we have

A smooth action of a Lie group on a compact manifold gives rise to a manifolds with
corners and boundary ﬁbration structures, see [6], but for us the main class of examples
comes from resolving a stratiﬁed space. Let us work out in detail how a stratiﬁed space
gives rise to a manifold with corners and a boundary ﬁbration structure in the two simplest

non-trivial cases:

If (cid:98)X has a single singular stratum Y, then blowing-up Y as described in §6.2 produces
a smooth manifold with boundary [(cid:98)X; Y ] with a boundary ﬁbration over Y. (Note that the
boundary of [(cid:98)X; Y ] need not be connected, which is why the deﬁnition involves collective
boundary hypersurfaces.) We denote the blown-up space by (cid:101)X and call it the resolution of (cid:98)X.
If (cid:98)X has two singular strata Y1 < Y2 (assumed connected) then blowing-up Y1 results in
[(cid:98)X; Y1], a depth one stratiﬁed space with boundary K1 and a locally trivial ﬁbration

Z1 — K1

in §6.3 allows us to blow-up Y in [(cid:98)X; Y1] resulting in a manifold with corners [[(cid:98)X; Y1];Y].

has as base the resolution of Y2 and as ﬁber the link of Y2 in (cid:98)X.
The other boundary hypersurface of (cid:101)X is [K1; K1 ∩ Y]. The set K1 ∩ Y is transverse to

sets with the corresponding resolutions,(cid:101)Z1 — (cid:101)K1
Finally note that the two boundary hypersurfaces (cid:101)K1, K2 intersect

φY1−−−→ Y1.

(cid:101)K1 ∩ K2 = ∂(cid:101)K1 = ∂K2.

The boundary ﬁbrations restricted to this intersection satisfy

β : (cid:101)X −→ (cid:98)X

a) Let (cid:98)X be a compact Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space. Iteratively blowing-up the deep-
est stratum produces a manifold with corners with an iterated ﬁbration structure (cid:101)X,
known as the resolution of (cid:98)X, together with a continuous map
i) β restricts to a diﬀeomorphism between the interior of (cid:101)X and the regular part of
(cid:98)X,
ii) β determines a bijection between the collective boundary hypersurfaces F ((cid:101)X)
and the singular strata of (cid:98)X,
iii) the boundary ﬁbration on β−1(Y ) ∈ F ((cid:101)X) has base space the resolution of Y ,
(cid:101)Y , and ﬁber over a point q ∈ Y equal to the resolution of the link of q in (cid:98)X.
b) Let (cid:101)X be a manifold with corners with an iterated ﬁbration structure. Choosing com-
ﬁbration with largest dimensional base produces a Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space (cid:98)X,
called the blow-down of (cid:101)X.
c) These procedures are mutually inverse: the blow-down of the resolution of (cid:98)X is iso-
morphic to (cid:98)X, and the resolution of the blow-down of L is isomorphic to L.
Resolution of stratiﬁed spaces is a functor (cf. [3, Propositions 2.6, 2.7]): If (cid:98)X and (cid:98)N
are stratiﬁed spaces with resolutions (cid:101)X and (cid:101)N , then any morphism f : (cid:98)X −→ (cid:98)N lifts to a
morphism (cid:101)f : (cid:101)X −→ (cid:101)N and compositions lift to compositions. Blow-down is also a functor

patible collar neighborhoods and then iteratively collapsing the ﬁbers of the boundary

but from manifolds with corners and iterated ﬁbration structures to isomorphism classes of
stratiﬁed spaces because we do not ﬁx collar neighborhoods of the boundary hypersurfaces.
‘Controlled’ objects on a stratiﬁed space correspond to objects on the resolution that are
compatible with the boundary ﬁbration structure. For example given a controlled vector

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

we get a vector ﬁeld on (cid:101)X by lifting ξ(cid:98)X reg and taking the unique continuous extension from
(cid:101)X◦ (which exists by the control conditions on ξ). Conversely, given a vector ﬁeld η on (cid:101)X,

Let us mention another approach to obtaining the resolution of a stratiﬁed space. After
blowing-up the deepest stratum as in §6.2, one can make use of the collar of the bound-

ary to deﬁne the double of [(cid:98)X; (cid:98)X∗]. This will be a Thom-Mather stratiﬁed space (without
boundary) whose depth is now less than the depth of (cid:98)X. It comes equipped with an action
of Z2 and a fundamental domain for this action recovers [(cid:98)X; (cid:98)X∗]. Inductively one can show
fundamental domain yields (cid:101)X. This doubling technique is developed in [28] where it is called

that the double can be resolved consistently with the Z2 action and then restricting to a

d´eplissage. This approach to resolution was carried out in [3].

Finally let us comment on the use of collective boundary hypersurfaces in Deﬁnition 3.
A stratiﬁed space if called normal [53, §4] if all of its links are connected. In the resolution
of a normal stratiﬁed space it is not necessary to use collective boundary hypersurfaces and
each boundary hypersurface is endowed with a boundary ﬁbration. On the other hand, given
a boundary ﬁbration structure with collective boundary hypersurfaces, one can restrict the
boundary ﬁbrations to the individual boundary hypersurfaces. This corresponds to switching

from the resolution of (cid:98)X to the resolution of its normalization (as in [53, §4.1]). For the
purposes of carrying out analysis on the regular part of (cid:98)X, normalization makes only a

notational diﬀerence and so for simplicity we often assume that the collective boundary
hypersurfaces consist of a single boundary hypersurface. This is the approach taken in [3].

6.5. A smooth de Rham complex computing intersection cohomology. In [33],
Brylinski introduced a de Rham complex due to Goresky-MacPherson on the regular part of
a stratiﬁed space that computed the intersection cohomology (cf. [27, 28, 98]). This complex
has a very natural description once we are working on the resolution of the stratiﬁed space.
We give a brief description of this complex as an example of the usefulness of resolving a
stratiﬁed space.

First, given a locally trivial ﬁber bundle of smooth manifolds with corners

let us say that a diﬀerential form ω on H has ϕ-vertical degree at most p if

7. Borel-Serre compactifications and their resolutions

The Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation and what is now known as the reductive Borel-Serre
compactiﬁcation of a locally symmetric space into a manifold with corners and a stratiﬁed
space, respectively, were introduced in [23] and [120]. In this section we will deﬁne another
compactiﬁcation of a locally symmetric space into a manifold with corners, the resolved
Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation. We will show that while the Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation does
not have an iterated ﬁbration structure, the resolved Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation does and
that it can be obtained by resolving the reductive Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation in the sense
of Theorem 6.3.

It may be interesting to compare the resolved Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation to other com-

pactiﬁcations of locally symmetric spaces.

7.1. Linear algebraic groups. We review enough of the theory of linear algebraic groups
to describe compactiﬁcations of locally symmetric spaces. We follow [23, 25] to which we
refer for proofs and longer explanations; see also, e.g., [51, 102, 121].
A linear algebraic group is a Zariski-closed subgroup of some GLn(C). If it can be deﬁned
by polynomials with Q-coeﬃcients we say that it is deﬁned over Q. We will denote such
groups by bold letters such as G. Their real points are then denoted by G(R) or the non-
bold letter G and form a real Lie group. The connected component of the identity will be
denoted G◦.
copies of C∗. If the isomorphism is deﬁned over a ﬁeld F, we say that it is split over F.

A linear algebraic group T is called an algebraic torus if it is isomorphic to a product of
An element r ∈ G is unipotent if some positive power of (r − Id) is equal to the identity,
and a linear algebraic group is called unipotent if all of its elements are unipotent. Every
unipotent group is solvable.

The radical R(G) of an algebraic group G is the maximal connected normal solvable
subgroup of G, and the unipotent radical, RU(G), is the maximal connected unipotent
normal subgroup of G. If G is deﬁned over Q, then so are R(G) and RU(G). We say that G
is semisimple if R(G) is trivial and reductive if RU(G) is trivial. We denote the real points
in RU(G) by RU G.
A Levi subgroup L of G is a maximal reductive subgroup; any two such are conjugate
under RU(G) and G = L (cid:110) RU(G). By a Levi subgroup L of G = G(R) we will mean the
real points of a Levi subgroup L of G. Every compact subgroup of G is the group of real
points of a reductive R-group and is hence contained in a Levi subgroup.

The maximal tori of G, split over a ﬁeld F, are all conjugate over F, and their common
dimension is called the F-rank of G, rkF(G). A group G is split over Q if its Q-rank coincides
with its C-rank. A group G is anisotropic over Q if it is of Q-rank zero.

A closed subgroup P of a connected linear algebraic group G is called a parabolic subgroup
if G/P is a projective variety or if P contains a maximal connected solvable subgroup (known
as a Borel subgroup). By a parabolic subgroup P of G we will mean the real points of a
parabolic subgroup P of G, deﬁned over Q. A subgroup H of G is parabolic if and only if
G/H is compact. We denote the set of proper parabolic subgroups of G by P(G).
KP = K ∩ P is a maximal compact subgroup of P and G = K · P.

If K is a maximal compact subgroup of G and P is a parabolic subgroup of G then

If G is reductive and K is a maximal compact subgroup of G, there exists one and only
one involutive automorphism θK of G whose ﬁxed point set is K and which is algebraic (in

52

PIERRE ALBIN

a suitable sense [23, Proposition 1.6]). This automorphism is called the Cartan involution of
G with respect to K.
If N is a normal subgroup of G deﬁned over R, then θK(N(R)) = N(R). If P is a parabolic
subgroup of G and L a Levi subgroup of G containing K, then L∩ P contains a unique Levi
subgroup of P stable under θK.

We will assume from now on that G is a connected reductive linear algebraic group deﬁned

over Q whose center is (deﬁned and) anisotropic over Q.

For any parabolic subgroup P of G deﬁned over Q both UP, the unipotent radical of P,
and LP = P/UP, the Levi quotient of P, are also deﬁned over Q. Let χ(LP) denote the
group of algebraic rationally deﬁned characters of LP and

(cid:92)

MP =

ker α2.

α∈χ(LP)

Then MP is a reductive algebraic group deﬁned over Q whose center is anisotropic over Q
(it may fail to be connected but see [24, Remark 2.10]). Let SP be the maximal Q-split torus
in the center of LP, and denote

UP = UP(R), LP = LP(R), MP = MP(R), SP = SP(R), AP = S◦
P .

There is a canonical isomorphism

AP = (R∗

+)parkG(P)

where parkG(P), the parabolic rank of P in G, is the length of a maximal chain

P = PparkG(P) ⊂ PparkG(P)−1 ⊂ ··· ⊂ P1 ⊂ G

of proper parabolic subgroups deﬁned over Q. The real points of the Levi quotient admit a
decomposition

LP = APMP

∼= AP × MP.

For each choice of maximal compact subgroup K of G, there is a unique lift LP,θK ⊆ P of

LP to a subgroup of P stable under θK. This lift splits the exact sequence

1 −→ UP −→ P −→ LP −→ 1.

It is possible to choose K so that LP,θK is deﬁned over Q, and then so are the images AP,θK
and MP,θK of its subgroups AP and MP. This yields the rational Langlands decomposition
of P :

P = UP AP,θK MP,θK

∼= UP × AP,θK × MP,θK .

The intersection of K and P, KP = K ∩ P is a maximal compact subgroup of P. Its
image under the map P (cid:55)→ LP is a maximal compact subset of MP and the lift of this image
coincides with KP .
Next, let us consider the parabolic subgroups of G, deﬁned over Q, contained in P. These
are the parabolic subgroups of P and [23, §4.1] are in one-to-one correspondence with the
parabolic subgroups of LP (in fact MP) by the projection P −→ P/UP. If P, Q ∈ P(G)
and Q ⊆ P then

QP = Q ∩ MP,θK ∈ P(MP).

The Langlands decompositions of Q (with respect to θK) and QP (with respect to θK∩P ),

Q = UQAQ,θK MQ,θK , QP = UQPAQP,θK∩P MQP,θK∩P ,

ON THE HODGE THEORY OF STRATIFIED SPACES

53

are related by

UQ = UP (cid:111) UQP , AQ,θK = AP,θK × AQP,θK∩P , MQ,θK = MQP,θK∩P .

(7.1)
Note that KQ = K ∩ MQ,θK = KQP . Below we will omit the Cartan involution θ in the
notation for the Langlands decompositions.

The notion of an arithmetic subgroup of G(Q) is a sort of ‘substitute’ for G(Z). Given
a representation ρ : G −→ GLn deﬁned over Q with discrete null space (i.e., an ‘almost
faithful’ representation), we can set

G(Z)ρ = ρ−1(GLn(Z)).

If ρ(cid:48) is any other almost faithful representation then G(Z)ρ(cid:48) is commensurable with G(Z)ρ,
meaning that the intersection of these two groups is of ﬁnite index in either one. We call
any group Γ < G(Q) commensurable with G(Z)ρ an arithmetic subgroup.
An arithmetic subgroup Γ is neat if, whenever H2 < H1 is a pair of algebraic Q-subgroups

of G,

ΓH1/H2 = (Γ ∩ H1(Q))/(Γ ∩ H2(Q))

is torsion-free (and arithmetic). Every arithmetic group contains a neat normal subgroup of
ﬁnite index.

7.2. The partial compactiﬁcation of a symmetric space to a manifold with corners.
As above, we assume that G is a connected reductive linear algebraic group deﬁned over Q
whose center is (deﬁned and) anisotropic over Q. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup of
G and let

X = G/K

be the corresponding symmetric space. In this section we describe the Borel-Serre partial
compactiﬁcation [23] of X to a non-compact manifold with corners, X. We will also describe

a ‘resolution’ of X to a non-compact manifold with corners (cid:101)X with a boundary ﬁbration

structure.

Given P ∈ P(G), the group KP = K∩P is a maximal compact subgroup of P. It coincides

with K ∩ MP and is also a maximal compact subgroup of MP. The quotient space

XP = MP/KP = P/KP APUP

is a symmetric space of non-compact type for MP called the boundary symmetric space
associated to P.

For each P ∈ P(G) let

eG(P ) = UP × XP .

X = X ∪ (cid:71)

eG(P ),

P∈P(G)

The Borel-Serre partial compactiﬁcation of X, as a set, is

(7.2)

where eG(P ) is attached to X using the horospherical decomposition X = UP × AP × XP
(see [23, 25]) and is a paracompact Hausdorﬀ manifold with corners. Each eG(P ) is the

54

interior of a boundary face of X, with codimension equal to the parabolic rank of P, and
with closure in X given by

eG(P ) = eG(P ) ∪ (cid:71)

eG(Q).

Q∈P(G)
Q⊆P

(7.3)

Note that KQ = K ∩ MQ = KQP , and hence the boundary symmetric space associated to
Q as a subgroup of G is the same as the boundary symmetric space associated to QP as a
subgroup of MP ,

XQ = MQ/KQ = MQP /KQP = XQP .

Proposition 7.1 (Boundary ﬁbrations of the partial Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation). Let X
be the symmetric space of the real points of a connected reductive group G as above and let
X be its Borel-Serre partial compactiﬁcation to a manifold with corners. Each boundary face
of X is of the form

eG(P ) = UP × XP

where P ∈ P(G), UP is the unipotent radical of P, XP is the boundary symmetric space
corresponding to P and XP is its Borel-Serre partial compactiﬁcation. Let φP : eG(P ) −→
XP denote the natural projection.

If P, Q ∈ P(G) then the boundary faces eG(P ), eG(Q) intersect if and only if

in which case eG(P ) ∩ eG(Q) = eG(R) and we have a commutative diagram,

where eMP (RP ) = URP × XRP . Thus to each R ∈ P(G), R ⊆ P, we assign a boundary face

eG(R) = UR × XR = UP × URP × XR,
eMP (RP ) = URP × XRP = URP × XR.

φP (eG(R)) = URP × XR = eMP (RP ).

commutes, and by symmetry so does the left half.
(cid:3)

Proposition 7.1, particularly diagram (7.4), shows that the Borel-Serre partial compacti-
ﬁcation X does not have the structure of a manifold with corners with an iterated ﬁbration
structure (except when it is a manifold with boundary). It is always possible to modify X
to obtain an iterated ﬁbration structure.
Recall (e.g., [88, Chapter 5], [6]) that if M is a manifold with corners and F ⊆ M is a

boundary face, then

[M ; F ],

the radial blow-up of M along F is a manifold with corners in which F is replaced by
its inward-pointing spherical normal bundle, forming a new boundary hypersurface (i.e., a
boundary face of codimension one). There is a natural ‘blow-down map’ β : [M ; F ] −→ M
which collapses the new boundary hypersurface back to F.
Consider the simple case of two maximal proper parabolic subgroups P and Q such that
R = P ∩ Q is itself parabolic. The space [X; eG(R)], replaces eG(R) with a new boundary
hypersurface

The blow-down map β : [X; eG(R)] −→ X restricts to EG(R) to a (trivial) ﬁber bundle

EG(R).

since EG(R) is the total space of the inward pointing spherical normal bundle of eG(R) in X.
We can relabel this in terms of the rational Langlands decomposition of P. Indeed, recall [23],
that eG(R) has a neighborhood of the form

X(R) = X ×AR AR

For each k ∈ N, let X tb>k denote the space obtained from X by blowing-up all of the

boundary faces of codimension greater than k and let

denote the blow-down map. Thus

(cid:101)X = X tb = X tb>1.

Consider P ∈ P(G) of parabolic rank (cid:96). The face eG(P ) has codimension (cid:96) in X, so if

then FG(P ) is obtained from eG(P ) by blowing-up all of its boundary faces in order of
increasing codimension. Thus we have

FG(P ) = eG(P )tb = UP × (XP )tb = UP × (cid:102)XP .

When we pass to X tb>(cid:96)−1, the boundary face FG(P ) itself gets blown-up so it lifts to a

In particular, we can identify

Then using the short exact sequence

we can further identify this with

We deﬁne the resolved Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation of Γ(cid:31)X to be

Theorem 7.4 (Boundary ﬁbrations of the resolved Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation). Let X be
the symmetric space of the real point of a connected reductive group G as above, let Γ be a

neat arithmetic subgroup of G(Q), and let Γ(cid:31)(cid:101)X be the resolved Borel-Serre compactiﬁcation

There is one boundary hypersurface E(cid:48)

G(P ) for each Γ-conjugacy class of Q-parabolic sub-

groups of G. Each of these boundary hypersurfaces is the total space of a ﬁber bundle

Proof. In terms of the rational Langlands decomposition of a parabolic subgroup

the face EG(P ) of (cid:101)X is obtained by taking the quotient of AP by a diagonal R∗

+-action and
the quotient of MP by the action of a maximal compact subgroup. It is this decomposition
of P that induces the decomposition

P = UP APMP

EG(P ) = UP × (AP /R∗

+)tb × (cid:102)XP .

Thus if we take a quotient of this face by ΓUP = Γ∩ UP it will act entirely on the ﬁst factor,

(cid:31)UP ) × (AP /R∗
Subsequently taking the quotient by the action of ΓMP yields

(cid:31)EG(P ) = (ΓUP

with the group ΓMP acting on the ﬁrst factor by conjugation. However, since AP is in the
