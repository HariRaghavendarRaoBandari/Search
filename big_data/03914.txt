A Note on Skew Characters of Symmetric Groups

Jay Taylor

In previous work Regev used part of the representation theory of Lie superalgebras to
Abstract.
compute the values of a character of the symmetric group whose decomposition into irreducible
constituents is described by semistandard (k, ℓ)-tableaux. In this short note we give a new proof
of Regev’s result using skew characters.

1.

Introduction

1.1. For any partition α ∈ P(n) of an integer n > 0 we have a corresponding irreducible character
χα of the symmetric group Sn; we assume this labelling is as in [Mac95, 7.4]. In [Reg13] Regev observed
that the values of the character Γn = ∑n
a=0 χ(a,1n−a) obtained by summing over all hook partitions were
particularly simple. Speciﬁcally if ν ∈ Pr(n) is a partition of length r then we have

Γn(ν) = 


2r−1

if all parts of ν are odd,

0

otherwise.

Here we write Γn(ν) for the value of Γn at an element of cycle type ν.

1.2. To prove this result Regev considered a more general but related problem which we now recall.
For any integers k, ℓ > 0 and any partition α ∈ P(n) we denote by sk,ℓ(α) the number of all semistan-
dard (k, ℓ)-tableaux of shape α, see 2.6 for the deﬁnition. Motivated by the representation theory of Lie
superalgebras Regev considered the following character of Sn

Λk,ℓ

n = ∑

sk,ℓ(α)χα.

α∈P(n)

The main result of [Reg13] is the following.

Theorem 1.3 (Regev). If ν = (ν1, . . . , νr) ∈ Pr(n) is a partition of length r then

Λk,ℓ

n (ν) =

r
∏
i=1

(k + (−1)νi−1ℓ).

Remark 1.4. Note that sk,ℓ(α) 6= 0 if and only if α is contained in the (k, ℓ)-hook, as deﬁned in [BR87, 2.3].
In particular, we have Λk,ℓ

n is the same as the character χϕ∗

deﬁned in [Reg13].

1.5. Using formulas for the coefﬁcients sk,ℓ(α) obtained in [BR87] Regev deduces that Λ1,1

n = 2Γn from
which the statement of 1.1 follows immediately. To prove Theorem 1.3 Regev used results of Berele–Regev
on representations of Lie superalgebras [BR87]. However, Regev asks whether this result can be proven
entirely in the setting of the symmetric group. The purpose of this note is to provide such a proof. Our
proof is based on a description of the character Λk,ℓ
n as a sum of skew characters. With this we can use the
Murnaghan–Nakayama formula to compute the values of Λk,ℓ
n and thus prove Theorem 1.3. As a closing
remark we use our description in terms of skew characters to show that Λ1,1

n = 2Γn using Pieri’s rule.

Remark 1.6. The idea we use in this paper was prompted by a recent question of Marcel Novaes on
MathOverﬂow [Nov16], which is where we also ﬁrst learned of Regev’s work.

2. The Result

2.1. Let N = {1, 2, . . . } be the natural numbers and N0 = N ∪ {0}. Throughout we use the term
diagram to mean a subset of N2. The notion of connected diagram and connected components of a
diagram have their usual natural meanings, see [Mac95, I, §1] for details. A diagram T will be called a
horizontal line, resp., vertical line, if for any (i, j), (i′, j′) ∈ T we have i = i′, resp., j = j′.

2.2. For any k ∈ N0 we denote by Ck the set of all compositions α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ Nk

0 of length k; we
call αi a part of α. For such a composition we denote by |α| the sum α1 + · · · + αk and by α◦ the composition
obtained from α by removing all parts equal to 0 but maintaining the original order. If n ∈ N0 then we
denote by Pk(n) the set of all α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ Ck such that α1 > · · · > αk > 0 and |α| = n, which are the
partitions of n of length k. Moreover we denote by P(n) the set Sk∈N Pk(n) of all partitions of n. To each
partition α ∈ P(n) we have a corresponding diagram Tα = {(i, j) | 1 6 j 6 αi} called the Young diagram of
α. A diagram S is then called a skew diagram if S = Tα \ Tβ for some Young diagrams Tβ ⊆ Tα. We recall
that if S is a skew diagram with |S| = n then we have a corresponding character ψS of Sn called a skew
character, c.f., [Mac95, §7, Example 3]. The following property of these characters is well known.

Lemma 2.3 (see [Mac95, 5.7]). If S and S′ are skew diagrams with the same connected components then ψS = ψS′.

2.4. For any k, ℓ, n ∈ N0 we denote by Bk,ℓ(n) ⊆ Ck × Cℓ the set of all pairs (λ | µ) of compositions
such that |λ| + |µ| = n; we call these bicompositions of n. Now for each bicomposition (λ | µ) ∈ Bk,ℓ(n)
we denote by S(λ|µ) some (any) skew diagram whose connected components H1, . . . , Hr, V1, . . . , Vs ⊆
S(λ;µ) are such that Hi is a horizontal line, resp., Vj is a vertical line, and (|H1|, . . . , |Hr|) = λ◦, resp.,
(|V1|, . . . , |Vs|) = µ◦. It is easy to see that such a diagram exists. By Lemma 2.3 we then get a well deﬁned
character ψ(λ|µ) := ψS(λ|µ) of Sn.

Example 2.5. Consider the bicomposition (4, 0, 5; 2, 3) ∈ B3,2(14) then an example of a corresponding
skew diagram S(4,0,5;2,3) is given by

2.6. We now prove Theorem 1.3 but before proceeding we recall some deﬁnitions from [BR87, 2.1].
Speciﬁcally, let D = {1, . . . , k, 1′, . . . , ℓ′} be a totally ordered set with 1 < · · · < k < 1′ < · · · < ℓ′. If
α ∈ P(n) is a partition and (λ | µ) ∈ Bk,ℓ(n) is a bicomposition then we say a function f
: Tα → D
f (x) = i}| for any 1 6 i 6 k
is a (k, ℓ)-tableau of shape α and weight (λ | µ) if λi = |{x ∈ Tα |
and µj = |{x ∈ Tα |
is semistandard if
Tf = f −1({1, . . . , k}) is a Young tableau whose rows are weakly increasing and whose columns are
strictly increasing and Tα \ Tf is a skew tableau whose columns are weakly increasing and whose rows
are strictly increasing. If s(λ|µ)(α) is the number of semistandard (k, ℓ)-tableaux of shape α and weight
(λ | µ) then sk,ℓ(α) := ∑(λ|µ) s(λ|µ)(α) is the number of all semistandard (k, ℓ)-tableaux of shape α.

f (x) = j′}| for any 1 6 j 6 ℓ. As in [BR87, 2.1] we say f

Lemma 2.7. For any k, ℓ, n ∈ N0 we have

Λk,ℓ

n = ∑

ψ(λ|µ).

(λ|µ)∈Bk,ℓ(n)

Proof. It follows from [Mac95, 3.4, 5.1, 5.4, 7.3] that for any bicomposition (λ | µ) ∈ Bk,ℓ(n) we have

ψ(λ|µ) = IndSn

Sλ×Sµ

(χ(λ1) b · · · b χ(λk) b χ(1µ1 ) b · · · b χ(1µℓ )),

where Sλ × Sµ is the Young subgroup determined by the parts of λ and µ. By [BR87, Lemma 3.23] we
have the decomposition of this character into irreducibles is given by

ψ(λ|µ) = ∑

s(λ|µ)(α)χα.

α∈P(n)

Note that when ℓ = 0 this statement is just Young’s rule and as in [BR87] the general case can be proved
easily by induction on ℓ using the deﬁnition of (k, ℓ)-tableaux. With this we obtain the desired statement

∑

ψ(λ|µ) = ∑

∑

s(λ|µ)(α)χα = ∑

sk,ℓ(α)χα.

(λ|µ)∈Bk,ℓ(n)

(λ|µ)∈Bk,ℓ(n)

α∈P(n)

α∈P(n)

Proof (of Theorem 1.3). Choose a part a of ν and let ˆν ∈ P(n − a) be the partition obtained by removing
the part a from ν but maintaining the original order. If λ ∈ Ck is a composition such that λi > a then we
denote by λ ↓i a ∈ Ck the composition obtained by replacing λi with λi − a. By the Murnaghan–Nakayama
formula for skew characters, see [JK81, 2.4.15], we have that

ψ(λ|µ)(ν) = ∑
λi>a

ψ(λ↓ia|µ)( ˆν) + ∑
µj>a

(−1)a−1ψ(λ|µ↓ja)( ˆν)

where the ﬁrst, resp., second, sum is over all 1 6 i 6 k, resp., 1 6 j 6 ℓ, such that λi > a, resp., µj > a.
Indeed, the connected component of the skew diagram S(λ|µ) labelled by λi, resp., µj, has an a-hook
of leg length 0, resp., (−1)a−1, if and only if λi > a, resp., µj > a. Now clearly every bicomposition
(λ′ | µ′) ∈ Bk,ℓ(n − a) arises from exactly k + ℓ bicompositions (λ | µ) ∈ via the process ↓i a and so by
Lemma 2.7 we have

Λk,ℓ

n (ν) = ∑

ψ(λ|µ)(ν) = (k + (−1)a−1ℓ)Λk,ℓ

n−a( ˆν).

(λ|µ)∈Bk,ℓ(n)

An easy induction argument completes the proof.

(cid:4)

Remark 2.8. Recall that the decomposition of ψ(λ|µ) into irreducible characters is given by the Littlewood–
Richardson coefﬁcients, see [Mac95, 5.3]. If k = ℓ = 1 then a simple application of Pieri’s rule shows that

ψ(a|n−a) =

χ(1n)
χ(a,1n−a) + χ(a+1,1n−a−1)

χ(n)

if a = 0,

if 0 < a < n,

if a = n.

This gives an alternative way to see that Λ1,1

n = 2Γn.
