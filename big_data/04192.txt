About the mass corrections in an abelian Higgs model

(Dated: March 15, 2016)

We study the corrections to the scalar boson mass in an abelian Higgs model by considering the
global properties of the partition function. We ﬁnd that although the two point function for the
Higgs boson receives quantum corrections, the mass of the scalar remains unaltered and thus the
physical mass is equal to the bare one.

INTRODUCTION

In the context in which the Higgs boson of the standard model has been at the forefront of both theoretical and
experimental search for decades and the corrections to the Higgs boson mass or more exactly the issues associated
to them have triggered a ﬂurry of theoretical papers it is important to study the problems associated with scalars
and their masses in smaller set-ups or more amenable models. The simple Φ4 theory has been the subject of many
investigations [1]-[13] in the last few decades, especially with regard to the behavior of the renormalized coupling
constant λR in the limit of large cut-oﬀ, the so-called ”triviality” problem. Recent studies suggest that indeed the Φ4
theory is trivial not only in the regime of large bare coupling constant [6], [7] but also for the full range of values of
this [13]. It is important to analyze if the same conclusions can be found in slightly more complicated theories that
include scalars.

In this work we extend the approach employed in [13] to study the two point correlator and the corrections to the
Higgs mass in an abelian Higgs model with spontaneous symmetry breaking. In section II we present the model and
also its counterpart in the Fourier space on a lattice. In section III we analyze the corrections to the propagator in
the approach introduced in [13]. Section IV is dedicated to conclusions.

We consider the abelian Higgs model with the Lagrangian:

III. QUANTUM CORRECTIONS TO THE SCALAR PROPAGATOR

In [13] we showed that in a simple Φ4 theory with a real scalar ﬁeld there is no correction to the all orders two
point function and thus to the scalar mass, hence the Φ4 theory is trivial. We shall apply the method presented there
to the abelian Higgs model. We start with the expression for the two point Higgs scalar function in the path integral
formalism:

hΩ|T h(x1)h(x2)|Ωi =
We ﬁrst write in the Fourier space:

lim

T →∞(1+iε) R dAµ(x)dh(x)dφ(x)d¯c(x)dc(x)h(x1)h(x2) exp[iR d4xL]

R dAµ(x)dh(x)dφ(x)d¯c(x)dc(x) exp[iR d4xL]

h(x1)h(x2) =

1

V 2 Xm

exp[−ikmx1]h(km)Xl

exp[−iklx2]h(kl),

and furthermore:

hΩ|T h(x1)h(x2)|Ωi =

exp[−ikmx1 − iklx2] ×

Qn,p,r,s,tR dAµ(kn)dh(kp)dφ(kr)d¯c(ks)dc(kt) exp[iR d4xL]

lim

where the exponent should be expressed also in the Fourier space.

Next we consider the function:

,

exp[−ikm(x1 − x2)]hh(km)h(−km)i =

1

V Xm
exp[−ikm(x1 − x2)]

Ix−y =

lim

T →∞(1+iε) Qn,p,r,s,tR dAµ(kn)dh(kp)dφ(kr)d¯c(ks)dc(kt)h(km)h(−km) exp[id4xL]

Qn,p,r,s,tR dAµ(kn)dh(kp)dφ(kr)d¯c(ks)dc(kt) exp[id4xL]

.(10)

The relation between Eq. (9) and Eq. (10) is given by:

1

Ix−y =

exp[−ikm(x1 − x2)]hh(km)h(−km)i =

V Xm
exp[−ikm(x1 − x2)]Z d4z1 exp[ikmz1]Z d4z2 exp[−ikmz2]hh(z1)h(z2)i =

Z d4z1d4z2δ(x1 − x2 − z1 + z2)hh(z1)h(z2)i =
Z d4z2hh(z2 + x1 − x2)h(z2)i.

But according to the deﬁnition of the two point function the following relation holds:

hh(z2 + x1 − x2)h(z2)i = Z
hΩ|T h(x1)h(x2)|Ωi,

d4p

(11)

(12)

where M (p2) is the all order correction to the two point function in the Fourier space of the scalar h. From Eqs. (11)
and (12) we then infer on the lattice:

Ix1−x2 = Z d4z2hΩ|T h(x1)h(x2)|Ωi = V Z

d4p

where V is the volume of space time. Here it is understood that:

in the continuum limit.

This shows that in order to determine the two point function for the Higgs boson it is suﬃcient to evaluate Ix1−x2.

In order to do that we ﬁrst separate from the Lagrangian the quadratic part as in Eq.(6). We then write:

hh(km)h(−km)i =
−2iV δ

−hφ(km)φ(−km)i + 2hc(km)¯c(−km)i + hAµ(km)Aµ(−km)i,

−

(15)

where the quantities in the brackets are deﬁned similarly with the deﬁnition for the Higgs boson.

One can compute the full partition function (in which no additional measure of integration is introduced) to extract

the dependence on the momenta [13], +[14], [15], [16]:

(16)

where the ﬁrst factor corresponds to the Higgs boson, the second to the gauge boson, the third to the Goldstone
boson and the last one to the ghosts. The Eqs. (15) and (16) lead to:

(17)

Here all the masses are bare masses and the quantities M (p2), ΣA(p2), Σ1(p2) and Σ2(p2) are the corrections to the
two point functions for the Higgs boson, gauge boson, Goldstone boson and ghost respectively. We can further write
Eq. (17) as:

(18)

Here in writing the right hand side of Eq. (18) we took into account two important facts:

4

1) The actual bare masses ξm2

A for the Goldstone boson and the ghost is gauge dependent and both the gauge

parameter and the mass can receive quantum correction.

2) The full propagator in the Feynman gauge has apart from the correction to the mass the same expression as the

bare one since in the model there are no derivative interactions pertaining to the gauge boson.

The full propagator for a boson particle X has a pole of the form:

Propagator ≈

1
X − ΣX (p2)

p2 − m2

,

(19)

where mX is the bare mass and ΣX is the all order correction to the two point function.
It is known that this
propagator has a pole at the physical mass of the particle and also weaker singularities in the form of branch cuts.
We expand the denominator in the right hand side of Eq. (19) to obtain:

p2 − m2
p2 − m2
(p2 − m2
(p2 − m2
where we deﬁne:

X − ΣX (p2) =
X − ΣX (p2 = m2
Xphys)(1 − Σ′(p2)|p2=m2
Xphys)SX (p2) − Σ′′(p2)|p2=m2

Xphys) − Σ′(p2)|p2=m2

In consequence:

and there are no other poles on the right hand side of Eq.
intermediate states do not produce other poles.

(22)

(22) since contributions from two or more particles

The same expansion can apply to all the quantities on the right hand side of Eq. (18) and leads to:

(23)

Then by comparing the pole structure on the right hand side and left hand side of the Eq. (23) and considering the
fact that the quantities SA, S1, S2 have no zeroes we conclude that:

hphys

h = m2
A = m2
Aphys
1phys = m2
2phys = m2

Aphys = m2

(24)

Note that at ﬁrst glance there are other possible combinations of results but by considering the possible gauge
dependence and the fact that the results should be correct no matter the gauge chosen and also the residue structure
for this case it is clear that the possibility outlined in Eq. (24) is the only choice. A ﬁnal remark is in order: these
results cannot be generalized easily and may lead to diﬀerent result for a nonabelian gauge theory due to the presence
of the derivative terms in the Lagrangian.

The renormalizability of the spontaneously broken gauge theories was treated in series of groundbreaking papers
[17]-[23]. The abelian Higgs model has been discussed in detail in [24]. It is this latter model that we study in the

IV. CONCLUSIONS

present work. Based on the approach initiated in [13] we analyzed the pole structure of the derivative δZ
δp2 where Z is
the partition function and p2 is the squared momentum, to ﬁnd that the pole of the Higgs boson all order propagator
is situated at the bare mass. The same result is obtained for the massive gauge boson. However these ﬁndings do not
imply that the respective propagators do not receive quantum corrections but just that these quantum corrections do
not displace the poles from the bare masses. In our study we made the underlying assumption that the the cut-oﬀ of
the theory goes to ∞.
The method employed in this work cannot be extended without complication to more complex models like the
non-abelian gauge theory or the standard model due to the presence of derivative interactions and of the fermion
mass terms in these theories. A detailed analysis of these cases will be performed in a separate work.
