BESOV SPACES ON OPEN SETS

TSUKASA IWABUCHI, TOKIO MATSUYAMA AND KOICHI TANIGUCHI

Abstract. This paper is devoted to giving deﬁnitions of Besov spaces on an arbi-
trary open set of Rn via the spectral theorem for the Schr¨odinger operator with the
Dirichlet boundary condition. The crucial point is to introduce some test function
spaces on Ω. The fundamental properties of Besov spaces are also shown, such as
embedding relations and duality, etc. Furthermore, the isomorphism relations are
established among the Besov spaces in which regularity of functions is measured by
the Dirichlet Laplacian and the Schr¨odinger operators.

1. Introduction

In 1959–61 Besov introduced the Besov spaces in his papers [2, 3]. There are a lot
of literatures on characterization of Besov spaces, and we refer to the books of Triebel
[37,38,40] for history of Besov spaces. It was by Peetre that the Fourier transform was
employed to study the Besov spaces on Rn (see [27–29], and also Frazier and Jawerth
[11, 12]). On a general domain, if the boundary is bounded and smooth, the theory
of Besov spaces is well established by extending functions on the domain to those on
Rn. Otherwise, the situation is quite diﬀerent as is indicated in previous studies (see
e.g. [37, 39]), and there appear to be considerable diﬃculties to construct such theory.

Let Ω be an open set of Rn with n ≥ 1. Our aim is to deﬁne the Besov spaces on Ω
based on the spectral theory by referring to Peetre’s idea. If the boundary ∂Ω of Ω is
smooth, then some basic notions are available; the restriction method of the function
on Rn to Ω, the zero extension to the outside of Ω, and certain intrinsic characteri-
zation (see [25, 32, 33, 36–41]). Recently, Bui, Duong and Yan introduced some test
function spaces to deﬁne the Besov spaces ˙Bs
p,q on an arbitrary open set, where s, p
and q satisfy |s| < 1 and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞ (see [4]). They also proved the equivalence
relation among the Besov spaces generated by the Laplacian and some operators,
including the Schr¨odinger operators, on the whole space Rn, n ≥ 3 with some addi-
tional conditions such as H¨older continuity for the kernel of semi-group generated by
them. As to the results on the Besov spaces generated by the elliptic operators on
manifolds, or Hermite operators, we refer to [1, 4–7, 10, 23] and the references therein.
To the best of our knowledge, it is necessary to impose some smoothness assumptions
on the boundary ∂Ω in order to deﬁne the Besov spaces Bs
p,q with all indices
s, p, q satisfying s ∈ R and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞.

p,q and ˙Bs

In this paper we shall deﬁne the Besov spaces Bs

p,q generated by the
Schr¨odinger operator −∆ + V with the Dirichlet boundary condition for all indices
s, p, q without any geometrical and smoothness assumption on the boundary ∂Ω, and
shall prove the fundamental properties such as embedding relations and lifting, etc.
Furthermore, regarding the Besov spaces generated by the Dirichlet Laplacian as the
2 ,∞(Ω),
standard one, and adopting the potential V belonging to the Lorentz space L
we shall establish the equivalence relation between the Besov spaces generated by the
Dirichlet Laplacian −∆|D and Schr¨odinger operator −∆|D + V . The motivation of
the study of such properties and equivalence relation comes from their applications to
partial diﬀerential equations, and one can consult the papers of D’Ancona and Pierfe-
lice (see [9]), Georgiev and Visciglia (see [14]) and Jensen and Nakamura (see [21,22]).

(1.1)

Here, the negative part V− of V is said to belong to the Kato class Kn(Ω) if V−
satisﬁes

Then −∆+V has a self-adjoint realization on L2(Ω) (see Lemma A.2 in appendix A).
Throughout this paper, we use the following notation:

Due to such a spectral resolution, we can deﬁne the Sobolev spaces H s(AV ) by letting

(1.3)

Then, the regularity and boundary value of functions in H s(AV ) are determined by
AV . Hereafter, we call H s(AV ) the Sobolev spaces by AV -regularity.
In particular
case Ω = Rn and V = 0, the Sobolev spaces deﬁned in (1.3) coincide with the
Bessel-potential spaces deﬁned via the Fourier transform.

We shall apply the above characterization of H s(AV ) to those of the inhomoge-
neous and homogeneous Besov spaces (see Theorem 2.5 below). For the Besov spaces
by this characterization, we obtain fundamental properties of the spaces (see Propo-
sitions 3.1–3.4 below) and ﬁnd a suﬃcient condition on the integrability of V such
that the isomorphism holds between the Besov spaces by A0 and AV -regularity (see
Proposition 3.5 below). It should be noted that our framework on open sets Ω of Rn
is the most general setting. The crucial point is to introduce test function spaces on Ω.

p,q and ˙Bs

Let us recall the deﬁnitions of the test function spaces on Rn and the classical
Besov spaces, i.e., spaces when Ω = Rn and V = 0.
It is well known that the
inhomogeneous Besov spaces and homogeneous ones are characterized as subspaces
of S ′(Rn) and Z ′(Rn) by the Littlewood-Paley dyadic decomposition of the spectrum
of √−∆, namely, Bs

respectively, for some smooth functions ψ, φ with compact supports. Here S ′(Rn)
is the space of the tempered distributions on Rn, which is the topological dual of
the Schwartz space S(Rn). The space S(Rn) consists of rapidly decreasing functions
equipped with the family of semi-norms

by the quotient space of S ′(Rn) modulo polynomials, i.e.,

where P(Rn) is the set of all polynomials of n real variables (see e.g. [16, 37]).

When Ω 6= Rn, a question naturally arises what the spaces corresponding to S ′(Rn)

we will encounter with two problems in the formulations:

V (Ω) and Z ′

(a) To handle the neighborhood of zero spectrum in the deﬁnition of the homo-

geneous Besov spaces;

(b) To develop the dyadic resolution of identity operators on our spaces X ′
Let us explain the problem (a). Looking at the deﬁnition (1.5) of Z(Rn), one

and Z ′

understands that the low frequency part of f is treated by

V (Ω)

However, when Ω 6= Rn it seems diﬃcult to get an idea corresponding to (1.6). To
overcome this diﬃculty, instead of (1.6), we propose

xαf (x)dx = 0

for any α ∈ (N ∪ {0})n.

This is probably a main novelty in our work. The condition (1.7) seems one of im-
portant ingredients to introduce test function spaces not only for Besov spaces but
also for other spaces of homogeneous type. We note that a kind of the problem of
zero spectrum does not appear in the inhomogeneous Besov spaces, and hence, our
spaces XV (Ω) and X ′
V (Ω) may be analogous to the test function spaces and their
duals introduced by Kerkyacharian and Petrushev [23] (see also Ruzhansky and Tok-
magambetov [31] who treat H s(AV ) on a bounded open set, and the operator AV
does not have to be self-adjoint).

We turn to explain the problem (b). For the sake of simplicity, let us consider the
case when V = 0. Clearly, in this case, AV becomes the Dirichlet Laplacian A0. As
is well-known, the identity operator is resolved by the dyadic decomposition of the
spectrum for the Dirichlet Laplacian in L2(Ω), namely,

Thanks to these resolutions (1.8) and (1.9), the well known methods in the classical
Besov spaces on Rn work well also in the present case. The starting point of this
argument is to extend the spectral restriction operators φj(√A0) on L2(Ω) to those
on L1(Ω). There, the uniform boundedness on L1(Ω) of {φj(√A0)}j, i.e.,

sup

j kφj(pA0)kL1(Ω)→L1(Ω) < ∞

(1.10)

plays a crucial role in proving (1.8) in X ′
0(Ω), respectively. For
the proof, see Proposition A.1 in appendix A (see also [19, 20]). Furthermore, (1.10)
guarantees the independence of the choice of {φj}j∈Z ∪ {ψ}, when we deﬁne spaces
X0(Ω), X ′

0(Ω), Z0(Ω), Z ′

This paper is organized as follows.

In §2, we state a main result on the Besov
spaces by AV -regularity. §3 is devoted to stating some fundamental properties of
Besov spaces. In §4, we introduce key lemmas and fundamental properties of test
function spaces on Ω, which are essential for our theory. §5–§9 are devoted to the
proof of our results. In appendix A, we show the uniform Lp-boundedness of φ(θAV ),
the self-adjointness of AV and the pointwise estimate for the kernel of e−tAV which
are veriﬁed with some modiﬁcations of our previous work [19]. Finally, we prove in
appendix B that zero is not an eigenvalue of AV under some smallness condition on
the negative part of V .

2. Statement of results

In this section we shall state several results on the Besov spaces by AV -regularity.
We divide this section into two subsections: the introduction of test function spaces,
and statement of the result.

2.1. Deﬁnitions of test function spaces on Ω. In this subsection we shall deﬁne
“test function spaces” consisting of functions smooth and integrable on Ω and spaces
of a kind of “tempered distributions” as follows:

Let φ0(·) ∈ C ∞

0 (R) be a non-negative function on R such that

supp φ0 ⊂ { λ ∈ R | 2−1 ≤ λ ≤ 2 }, Xj∈Z

φ0(2−jλ) = 1

for λ > 0,

and {φj}j∈Z is deﬁned by letting

We notice from assumption (2.3) that AV is non-negative on L2(Ω) and that zero
is not an eigenvalue of AV as well as the Dirichlet Laplacian. In fact, these results
hold for a weaker assumption (B.1) in appendix B. We also note that assumption
(2.3) excludes the potential V like

(2.6)

It is shown in Lemma 4.2 below that XV (Ω) and ZV (Ω) are complete, and hence,
they are Fr´echet spaces. Needless to say, it is not possible to deﬁne an operator √AV
if the spectrum of AV contains negative real numbers. However, since φj(λ) = 0 for
λ ≤ 0, we deﬁne φj(√AV ) as

φj(pAV ) =Z ∞

0

φj(√λ)dEAV (λ).

Let us give a few remarks on properties of X0(Ω) and Z0(Ω) as follows:

• When Ω = Rn and V = 0, the Schwartz space S(Rn) is contained in X0(Rn),
and the inclusion for tempered distributions are just opposite. Namely, it can
be readily checked from Deﬁnition 2.1 that

S(Rn) ֒→ X0(Rn) ֒→ X ′
Z(Rn) ֒→ Z0(Rn) ֒→ Z ′
0 (Rn) ⊂ X0(Rn), C ∞
C ∞

0(Rn) ֒→ S ′(Rn),
0(Rn) ֒→ Z ′(Rn),
0 (Rn) 6⊂ Z0(Rn).

(2.7)

• When Ω = Rn and V = 0, the restriction of low frequency in the deﬁnition
(2.4) of q0,M (f ) is natural, since one can show that any element f ∈ S(Rn)
belongs to Z(Rn) if and only if q0,M (f ) < ∞ for M = 1, 2, . . . .

• When Ω 6= Rn, any f ∈ X0(Ω) or Z0(Ω) satisﬁes

f ≡ 0 on ∂Ω,

since f ∈ H 1
0 (Ω). Hence, the condition p0,M (f ) < ∞ not only determines
smoothness and integrability of f but also assures the Dirichlet boundary
condition. Also, such an f contacts with ∂Ω of order inﬁnity in the following
way:

AM
0 f ≡ 0 on ∂Ω, M = 0, 1, 2,· · · .
The same assertion holds for XV (Ω), ZV (Ω) and AV .
• In order to simplify the argument, instead of the polynomial weights appearing
on semi-norms (1.4) in S(Rn), we adopted the integrability condition on f .
Based on Deﬁnitions 2.1–2.3, we establish the deﬁnition of Besov spaces on an

arbitrary open set of Rn in §§2.2.

2.2. Statement of the main result. We are in this subsection to state the result.
Let {φj}j∈Z ∪ {ψ} be the Littlewood-Paley dyadic decomposition, namely, the se-
quence {φj}j∈Z is deﬁned by (2.2), and ψ is a smooth function with compact support
around the origin. Here, we note that if V satisﬁes assumption (1.1), then the spec-
trum of AV may admit to be negative. It is shown in Lemma A.2 in appendix A that
there exists a positive constant λ0 such that
AV ≥ −λ2
0I.
Then we need to choose the function ψ such that
ψ(λ2) +Xj∈N

φj(λ) = 1 for λ ≥ 0.

for λ ∈ [−λ2

Based on this choice of ψ, let us introduce the deﬁnition of the Besov spaces by
AV -regularity.
Deﬁnition 2.4. For s ∈ R and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞, we deﬁne the inhomogeneous and
homogeneous Besov spaces as follows:
p,q(AV ) is deﬁned by letting

p,q(AV ) :=(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:8)2sjkφj(pAV )fkLp(Ω)(cid:9)j∈Z(cid:13)(cid:13)ℓq(Z).

Our main result can now be formulated in the following way:

Theorem 2.5. For any s, p, q with s ∈ R and 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞, the following assertions
hold:
(i) (Inhomogeneous Besov spaces) Assume that the measurable potential V satis-

ﬁes (1.1). Then:
(i-a) Bs

p,q(AV ) is independent of the choice of {ψ} ∪ {φj}j∈N satisfying (2.1),
(2.2) and (2.9), and enjoys the following:

Let us give a remark on the theorem. It is meaningful to consider the space X ′

0 (Rn) is dense in the classical Besov spaces Bs

Since C ∞

p,q for s ∈ R and 1 ≤ p, q < ∞,
0(Rn) are isomorphic to those as subspaces of S ′(Rn). Similarly,
0(Rn) are isomorphic to those as subspaces of Z ′(Rn).
3. Dual spaces, embedding relations, lifting properties and

isomorphic properties

In this section, we shall introduce important properties of Besov spaces. Let us
consider the dual spaces of Besov spaces, lifting properties and embedding relations.

The following proposition is concerned with the dual spaces.

Proposition 3.1. Assume that V satisﬁes the same assumptions as in Theorem 2.5.
Let s ∈ R, 1 ≤ p, q < ∞, 1/p + 1/p′ = 1 and 1/q + 1/q′ = 1. Then the dual spaces of

As was stated in §1, the classical homogeneous Besov spaces are considered as
subspaces of quotient space S ′(Rn)/P(Rn). The following proposition states that the
homogeneous Besov spaces with some indices s, p, q are characterized by subspaces

of X ′
of Ω = Rn (see, e.g. [24]).

Proposition 3.4. Assume that V satisﬁes (1.1) and (2.3). Let s ∈ R and 1 ≤
p, q ≤ ∞. If either s < n/p or (s, q) = (n/p, 1), then the homogeneous Besov spaces
˙Bs
p,q(AV ) are regarded as subspaces of X ′

(iii) If V is smooth more and more, then, s can be taken bigger and bigger so that
the isomorphism holds. For instance, this comes from the following identity:

(−∆ + V )2f = (−∆)2f + (−∆)(V f ) + V (−∆)f + V 2f

when we consider the case s = 4. In fact, the term (−∆)(V f ) requires the
diﬀerentiability of V .

4. Key lemmas

In this section we introduce some tools and prove fundamental properties of XV (Ω)
and ZV (Ω), which are important in later arguments. Here and below, we denote by
k · kLp the norm of Lp(Ω) and k · kLp(Rn) the norm of Lp(Rn).
φj(√AV ) for 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. In the previous work [19] we have established such kind of
estimates for some potential V when n ≥ 3. We improve them by some slight modi-
ﬁcations, and obtain Lp-estimates under more general conditions on our potential V
in all space dimensions (see Proposition A.1 in appendix A).

We start with the functional calculus; Lp-boundedness of operators ψ(AV ) and

Based on Proposition A.1, we have the following useful lemma.

Lemma 4.1. Let 1 ≤ r ≤ p ≤ ∞. Assume that the measurable potential V satisﬁes
(1.1). Then we have the following assertions:

(i) For any φ ∈ C ∞

0 (R) and m ∈ N ∪ {0} there exists a constant C > 0 such that

Proof. Let m ∈ N ∪ {0} and α ∈ R. To begin with, we note that the following
inequality
(4.4)

kAm

V φ(AV )gkLp ≤ CkgkLp

holds for any g ∈ Lp(Ω). In fact, writing
V φ(AV ) = {Am

V eAV φ(AV )}e−AV ,

and noting

we conclude from Proposition A.1 that (4.4) holds. In a similar way, we get

V φ(2−jpAV )gkLp ≤ C22αjkgkLp

(4.5)

for any j ∈ N and g ∈ Lp(Ω), provided that φ ∈ C ∞
Taking account of these considerations, we show (4.1). Let Gt(x) be the function
of Gaussian type appearing in the pointwise estimate (A.5) of kernel of e−tAV from
Lemma A.4, i.e.,

0 ((0,∞)).

where C is a certain positive constant. We write

By using pointwise estimate (A.5) for e−tAV , we have

φ(2−jpAV )f = e−2−2j AV(cid:8)e2−2j AV φ(2−jpAV )(cid:9)f.

where ˜f is a zero extension of f outside of Ω. Let r0 be such that 1/p = 1/r0 +1/r−1.
Then we conclude from the estimates (4.4), (4.6) and Young’s inequality that

j ∈ N,

x ∈ Ω,

This proves (4.1).

As to (4.2), again by using (4.5), (4.6) and Young’s inequality, we get

for any j ∈ N, which proves (4.2). The estimate (4.3) is also proved in the analo-
gous way to the above argument by applying (A.2) in Proposition A.1 and (A.6) in
Lemma A.4 instead of (A.1) in Proposition A.1 and (A.5) in Lemma A.4, respectively.
The proof of Lemma 4.1 is ﬁnished.
(cid:3)

The second lemma concerns with the completeness of test function spaces.

Lemma 4.2. Assume that the measurable potential V satisﬁes (1.1). Then XV (Ω)
is complete. In addition to the assumption (1.1), if V satisﬁes (2.3), then ZV (Ω) is
complete.
Proof. We ﬁrst show the completeness of XV (Ω). Let {fN}∞
in XV (Ω). Then, for M = 1, 2, . . . , there exists CM > 0 such that

N =1 be a Cauchy sequence

pV,M (fN ) ≤ CM for all N ∈ N.

(4.7)
Since {fN} is a Cauchy sequence in L1(Ω), there exists a function f ∈ L1(Ω) such
that
Combining this convergence with the boundedness of 2M jφj(√AV ) from L1(Ω) to
itself, which is assured by (4.2) for α = 0 and (4.7), we have

in L1(Ω) as N → ∞.

pV,M (f ) ≤ CM

for M = 1, 2, . . . . Hence we get f ∈ XV (Ω). We next show the convergence of fN to
f in XV (Ω). For each M, let us take a subsequence {fN (k)}∞

k=1 such that

where we put fN (0) = 0. Hence we have

pV,M (fN (k) − fN (k−1)) ≤ 2−k,

pV,M (fN (k) − fN (k−1)) < ∞.

(4.8)

∞Xk=1

LXk=1

Since {fN (k)}∞

k=1 is a Cauchy sequence in L1(Ω), f is written by

f = lim
L→∞

fN (L) = lim
L→∞

(fN (k) − fN (k−1))

in L1(Ω).

(4.9)

Then (4.8) and (4.9) yield the convergence of pV,M (fN (L) − f ) to zero as L → ∞, and
hence,

pV,M (fN − f ) → 0 as N → ∞ for M = 1, 2,· · · .

We next show the completeness of ZV (Ω). Let {fN}∞

Therefore, XV (Ω) is complete.
N =1 be a Cauchy sequence in
ZV (Ω). Since ZV (Ω) is a subspace of XV (Ω) and XV (Ω) is complete, {fN}∞
N =1 is also
a Cauchy sequence in XV (Ω) and there exists an element f ∈ XV (Ω) such that fN
converges to f in XV (Ω) as N → ∞. In order to prove f ∈ ZV (Ω), we show that

(4.10)

sup
j≤0

2M |j|kφj(pAV )fkL1 < ∞ for M = 1, 2,· · · .

lim

Since fN converges to f in L1(Ω) as N → ∞ and φj(√AV ) is bounded on L1(Ω) for
each j ∈ Z by (4.3) for α = 0, it follows that

Since {fN}∞
for each M and there exists a constant CM > 0 depending only on M such that

N→∞kφj(pAV )fNkL1 = kφj(pAV )fkL1
N =1 is a Cauchy sequence in ZV (Ω), {qV,M (fN )}∞
2M |j|kφj(√−∆)fNkL1 ≤ CM for all j ≤ 0 and N = 1, 2,· · · .

for any j ∈ Z.
N =1 is a bounded sequence

By taking the limit as N → ∞ in the above inequality, we conclude that f satisﬁes
(4.10), and hence, f ∈ ZV (Ω). Finally, the convergence of fN to f in ZV (Ω) follows
from the analogous argument to (4.8) and (4.9):

∞Xk=1

qV,M (fN (k) − fN (k−1)) < ∞,

LXk=1

(fN (k) − fN (k−1))

in L1(Ω),

f = lim
L→∞

which imply that

qV,M (fN − f ) → 0

as N → ∞ for M = 1, 2,· · · .

Thus we conclude that ZV (Ω) is complete. The proof of Lemma 4.2 is ﬁnished. (cid:3)

14

The third lemma is useful in proving Lemma 4.5.

Lemma 4.3. Assume that the measurable potential V satisﬁes (1.1). Then the fol-
lowing assertions hold:
(i) For any f ∈ X ′

V (Ω), there exist a number M0 ∈ N and a constant Cf > 0

such that

(ii) In addition to the assumption (1.1), if V satisﬁes (2.3), then for any f ∈

Z ′
V (Ω), there exist a number M1 ∈ N and a constant Cf > 0 such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′
V hf, giXV(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cf pV,M0(g)
(cid:12)(cid:12)Z ′
V hf, giZV(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ Cf qV,M1(g)

for any g ∈ XV (Ω).

for any g ∈ ZV (Ω).

Proof. Suppose that (i) is not true. Then for any m ∈ N there exists gm ∈ XV (Ω)
such that
(4.11)

Put

gm

V hf, gmiXV(cid:12)(cid:12) > mpV,m(gm).
(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′
egm :=
pV,k(egm) ≤ pV,m(egm) =

mpV,m(gm)

.

Noting that pV,k(egm) is monotonically increasing in k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m}, we have

for k = 1, 2,· · · , m.

1
m

Hence it follows that for any ﬁxed k ∈ N

thus we ﬁnd that

The above convergence yields that

However, the assumption (4.11) implies that

in XV (Ω) as m → ∞.

pV,k(egm) → 0 as m → ∞;
egm → 0
(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′
V hf,egmiXV(cid:12)(cid:12) → 0 as m → ∞.
(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′
V hf,egmiXV(cid:12)(cid:12) > 1 for all m ∈ N;

(4.12)

therefore this inequality contradicts (4.12). Thus the assertion (i) holds. The asser-
tion (ii) follows analogously. This ends the proof of Lemma 4.3.
(cid:3)

The following lemma states that the mapping φ(AV ) is well-deﬁned on XV (Ω),

ZV (Ω) and their duals.
Lemma 4.4. Assume that the measurable potential V satisﬁes (1.1). Then the fol-
lowing assertions hold:
(i) For any φ ∈ C ∞
0 (R), φ(AV ) maps continuously from XV (Ω) into itself, and
maps continuously from X ′
(ii) In addition to the assumption (1.1), if V satisﬁes (2.3), then for any φ ∈
C ∞
0 ((0,∞)), φ(AV ) maps continuously from ZV (Ω) into itself, and maps con-
tinuously from Z ′

V (Ω) into itself.

V (Ω) into itself.

Proof. First we prove the assertion (i). Let f ∈ XV (Ω).
Lemma 4.1 that

It follows from (4.1) in

Am
V φ(AV )f ∈ D(AV ),

(4.13)
for m = 0, 1, 2, . . .; M = 1, 2, . . . . This proves that φ(AV ) is continuous from XV (Ω)
into itself. The continuity of φ(AV ) from X ′
V (Ω) into itself follows from the deﬁnition
(2.5).

pV,M (φ(AV )f ) ≤ CpV,M (f )

As to the assertion (ii), since V satisﬁes (1.1), φ(AV ) enjoys the assertion (i), and

hence, we conclude that

We show that

φ(AV )f ∈ XV (Ω)

for any f ∈ ZV (Ω).

for M = 1, 2, . . .. Indeed, recalling the deﬁnition (2.4) of qV,M (f ) and noting that

qV,M (φ(AV )f ) ≤ CqV,M (f )

(4.14)

qV,M (φ(AV )f ) ≤ pV,M (φ(AV )f ) + sup

j≤0

we apply (4.13) to the ﬁrst term to obtain

2M |j|kφj(pAV )φ(AV )fkL1,

For the second term in qV,M (φ(AV )f ), again applying (4.1) for m = 0, we estimate

pV,M (φ(AV )f ) ≤ CpV,M (f ) ≤ CqV,M (f ).

2M |j|kφj(pAV )φ(AV )fkL1 ≤C sup

for M = 1, 2, . . . . Therefore, the above two estimates imply (4.14), which concludes
the continuity of φ(AV ) from ZV (Ω) into itself. Finally, the continuity of φ(AV )
from Z ′
V (Ω) into itself follows from the deﬁnition (2.6). The proof of Lemma 4.4 is
ﬁnished.
(cid:3)

The approximation of identity is established by the following lemma.

Lemma 4.5. Assume that the measurable potential V satisﬁes (1.1). Then the fol-
lowing assertions hold:

(i) For any f ∈ XV (Ω), we have

f = ψ(AV )f +Xj∈N

φj(pAV )f

in XV (Ω).

(4.15)

Furthermore, for any f ∈ X ′
and ψ(AV )f and φj(√AV )f are regarded as elements in L∞(Ω).

V (Ω), we have also the identity (4.15) in X ′

V (Ω),

(ii) In addition to the assumption (1.1), if V satisﬁes (2.3), then for any f ∈

f =Xj∈Z

in ZV (Ω).

(4.16)

Furthermore, for f ∈ Z ′
φj(√AV )f are regarded as elements in L∞(Ω).

V (Ω), we have also the identity (4.16) in Z ′

V (Ω), and

16

T. IWABUCHI, T. MATSUYAMA, K. TANIGUCHI

Proof. First we prove the assertion (i). Let f ∈ XV (Ω). Then we have f ∈ L2(Ω),
and f is written as

f = ψ(AV )f +Xj∈N

φj(pAV )f

in L2(Ω).

It is suﬃcient to verify that the series in the right member is absolutely convergent
in XV (Ω). Let M ∈ N be arbitrarily ﬁxed. Applying (4.2) for α = 0, 1 from Lemma
4.1, we have

which imply that

pV,M(cid:0)ψ(AV )f(cid:1) ≤ CpV,M (f ),
≤C2−2jpV,M +2(f ),

pV,M(cid:0)φj(pAV )f(cid:1) ≤C2−2jpV,M(cid:0)AV φj(pAV )f(cid:1)
Xj∈N
pV,M(cid:0)φj(pAV )f(cid:1) ≤ CpV,M +2(f )Xj∈N

2−2j < ∞.

Hence (4.15) holds for f ∈ XV (Ω). As to the expansion (4.15) for f ∈ X ′
V (Ω),
applying the identity (4.15) for g ∈ XV (Ω), we have formally the following identity:

X ′

V hf, giXV = X ′

V hf, ψ(AV )giXV +Xj∈N
V hψ(AV )f, giXV +Xj∈N

= X ′

X ′

X ′

V hf, φj(pAV )giXV
V hφj(pAV )f, giXV ,

where the second equality is valid due to the deﬁnition (2.5). We must prove the
absolute convergence of the series in (4.18). By Lemma 4.3 (i), there exist M0 ∈ N
and C > 0 such that

(4.17)

(4.18)

V hφj(pAV )f, giXV(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′
(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′

V hf, φj(pAV )giXV(cid:12)(cid:12)
≤Cf pV,M0(φj(pAV )g).

Then, the above estimate and (4.17) yield the absolute convergence of the series in
(4.18).

For the proof of ψ(AV )f ∈ L∞(Ω), we begin by proving that

for all g ∈ XV (Ω).

(4.19)

By the deﬁnition (2.5), Lemma 4.3 (i) and (4.1) for m = 0, there exist M0 ∈ N and
Cf , Cf,ψ > 0 such that

V hψ(AV )f, giXV(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ CkgkL1
(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′
(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′
V hψ(AV )f, giXV(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)X ′

V hf, ψ(AV )giXV(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤Cf pV,M0(ψ(AV )g)
≤Cf,ψkgkL1,

which proves (4.19). Thanks to (4.19), the Hahn-Banach theorem allows us to deduce
that the mapping

X ′

V hψ(AV )f,·iXV : XV (Ω) → C

BESOV SPACES

17

is extended as a mapping from L1(Ω) to C. Since L1(Ω)∗ = L∞(Ω), there exists a
function F ∈ L∞(Ω) such that

V hψ(AV )f, giXV =ZΩ

X ′

F (x)g(x) dx for all g ∈ XV (Ω).

Then we conclude that ψ(AV )f ∈ L∞(Ω). In a similar way, it is possible to prove
that φj(√AV )f ∈ L∞(Ω). The proof of (i) is now complete.
As to the assertion (ii), noting that any f ∈ ZV (Ω) is in L2(Ω), we ﬁrst prove that
(4.20)

in L2(Ω)

for any f ∈ L2(Ω). Put

f =Xj∈Z
φj(pAV )f
gL :=Z ∞
−∞(cid:16)1 −Xj≥L

φj(√λ)(cid:17)dEAV (λ)f.

(4.21)

It is readily checked that {gL} is a Cauchy sequence in L2(Ω), so we put

g := lim

gL

L→−∞

in L2(Ω).

Noting that AV is non-negative on L2(Ω) and that the support of 1 −Pj≥L φj(√λ)

is contained in the interval (−∞, 22L], we ﬁnd that

kAV gLk2

Hence we deduce that

g ∈ D(AV ),

AV g = 0 in L2(Ω)

by the fact that gL ∈ D(AV ), the deﬁnition of g, and the closeness of AV on L2(Ω).
Since zero is not an eigenvalue of AV by Lemma B.1, we conclude that g = 0, which
proves (4.20) for any f ∈ L2(Ω).
Now, as in the previous argument, it is suﬃcient to show that the series in the
right member of (4.20) is absolutely convergent in ZV (Ω). For the series (4.20) with
j ≥ 1, the absolute convergence is obtained by the same argument as (4.17). For the
case j ≤ 0, it follows from (4.3) for α = ±1 that

qV,M(cid:0)φj(pAV )f(cid:1) ≤ C22jqV,M(cid:0)A−1

V φj(pAV )f(cid:1) ≤ C22jqV,M +2(f ),

which imply that

Xj≤0

qV,M(cid:0)φj(pAV )f(cid:1) ≤ CqV,M +2(f )Xj≤0

22j < ∞

for all M ∈ N. Therefore, (4.16) is veriﬁed for f ∈ ZV (Ω).
Finally, as to the identity (4.16) for f ∈ Z ′
V (Ω), we proceed the analogous argument
to that with replacing the assertion (i) for pV,M and Lemma 4.3 (i) by qV,M and
Lemma 4.3 (ii), respectively. The proof of φj(√AV )f ∈ L∞(Ω) also follows from the

analogous argument to that of the assertion (i) as above. So we may omit the details.
The proof of Lemma 4.5 is complete.

As a consequence of Lemmas 4.1 and 4.5, we have:

Lemma 4.6. The following inclusion relations hold:

XV (Ω) ⊂ L1(Ω) ∩ L∞(Ω),

Lp(Ω) ⊂ X ′

V (Ω)

for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.

As a consequence, we have

ZV (Ω) ⊂ L1(Ω) ∩ L∞(Ω),

Lp(Ω) ⊂ Z ′

V (Ω)

for any 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞.

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

Proof. Once (4.22) and (4.23) are proved, (4.24) and (4.25) hold, since

ZV (Ω) ⊂ XV (Ω)

and X ′

V (Ω) ⊂ Z ′

V (Ω).

We show the inclusion relation (4.22). Put

Φj := φj−1 + φj + φj+1.

Let f ∈ XV (Ω). Then it follows from the deﬁnition of semi-norms pV,M (·) that

kfkL1 ≤ pV,0(f ).

As to the L∞-norm, we deduce from the identities (4.15), φj = Φjφj and the estimate
(4.2) for α = 0 that

kfkL∞ ≤kψ(AV )fkL∞ +Xj∈N kΦj(pAV )φj(pAV )fkL∞
2−j · 2j2njkφj(pAV )fkL1

≤CpV,0(f ) + CXj∈N

≤CpV,n+1(f ).

2−j sup
k∈N

2(n+1)kkφk(pAV )fkL1

Summarizing the above estimates now, we conclude the inclusion relation (4.22).

Finally, we prove the inclusion relation (4.23). Let f ∈ Lp(Ω) and g ∈ XV (Ω).

Then it follows from H¨older’s inequality and the above two estimates that

ZΩ |f (x)g(x)|dx ≤kfkLpkgkLp′

≤kfkLpkgkL1∩L∞
≤CkfkLppV,n+1(g),

where p′ is the conjugate exponent of p. This estimate means that f ∈ Lp(Ω) belongs
to X ′

V (Ω). Hence we conclude (4.23). The proof of Lemma 4.6 is complete.

In this section we prove Theorem 2.5.

Proof of independence of the choice of ψ and {φj}. The proof of the indepen-
dence in (i-a) and (ii-a) is similar to that of Triebel [37]. As to (i-a), let us take
ψ = ψ(k), φj = φ(k)
(k = 1, 2) satisfying (2.1), (2.2) and (2.9). Since ψ(1) and φ(1)

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:8)2sjkφ(1)

This proves the independence in (i-1) for the inhomogeneous Besov spaces.

As to (ii-a), we use the identity (5.1) for all j ∈ Z and apply (4.3) for α = 0 in

Lemma 4.1 to get

This ends the proof of the required independence of the choice of ψ and {φj}.
Proof of inclusion relations (2.10) and (2.11). Let p′ and q′ be such that 1/p +
1/p′ = 1 and 1/q + 1/q′ = 1. First we prove the embedding (2.10), namely,

(cid:3)

XV (Ω) ֒→ Bs

p,q(AV ) ֒→ X ′

V (Ω).

Take Ψ and Φj such that

Ψ := ψ + φ1, Φ1 := ψ + φ1 + φ2, Φj := φj−1 + φj + φj+1 for j = 2, 3,· · · .

Let M ∈ N be such that M > s + n(1 − 1/p). Then, for any f ∈ XV (Ω), we deduce
from the identities φj = Φjφj and the estimate (4.2) for α = 0 in Lemma 4.1 that

replaced by −s, p′, q′, i.e.,
we have, for f ∈ Bs

7. Proof of Proposition 3.2

In this section we prove Proposition 3.2. The embedding relations are immediate

consequences of Lemma 4.1. The main point is to prove the lifting properties.

First we prove the homogeneous case, namely,

As0/2

f ∈ ˙Bs−s0

for any f ∈ ˙Bs

To begin with, we show that

As0/2

is a continuous operator from Z ′

V (Ω) to itself.

(7.1)

By the deﬁnition (2.6), it is suﬃcient to verify that As0/2
is the continuous operator
from ZV (Ω) to itself. Let us take M0 ∈ N such that M0 > |s0|. It follows from (4.3)
for α = s0/2 and (4.16) that

In fact, let

Φj := φj−1 + φj + φj+1.

We note that Φj(λ)λs0 ∈ C ∞

0 ((0,∞)). Writing

Φj(λ)λs0 = 2s0j · Φj(λ) · (2−s0jλs0),

g ∈ ZV (Ω). This proves (7.1). Hence, all

(7.2)

we get

kφj(pAV )As0/2

≤C2s0jkφj(pAV )fkLp.

V (cid:9)φj(pAV )f(cid:13)(cid:13)Lp

Hence, multiplying 2(s−s0)j to the above inequality and taking the ℓq(Z)-norm, we
obtain the required inequality (7.2).

As to inhomogeneous case, we have to consider the operators

(λ2

0 + 1 + AV )s0/2φj(pAV ).

The only diﬀerent point from the homogeneous case is to show the following estimates:

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(λ2
0 + 1 + AV )s0/2φj(pAV )f(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Lp ≤ C2s0j(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)φj(pAV )f(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)Lp

Since θ is small compared with the spectrum of 2−2jAV φj(√AV ), θ is able to be
neglected. Hence, the proof of estimate (7.4) is done by the argument of our paper
[19]. So, we may omit the details. Summarizing the estimates obtained now, we
conclude the estimate (7.3). The proof of Proposition 3.2 is ﬁnished.

T. IWABUCHI, T. MATSUYAMA, K. TANIGUCHI

Proof. Since e2−2j λ2φj(λ) is in C ∞

0 ((0,∞)), it follows from (4.2) for α = 0 that

for any j ∈ N. Then, taking the ℓ2(N)-norm, we obtain (8.1). As to the homogeneous
case, thanks to (4.3) for α = 0, inequality (8.3) is also valid for any j ∈ Z, and hence,
taking the ℓ2(Z)-norm, we conclude (8.2).

Taking the limit as N → ∞ in the above inequality, and combining the resultant with

get the embedding (8.5).

We must show (8.7). Let ef be the zero extension of f to the outside of Ω. Recall

that Gt(x) is the function of Gaussian type in the right member of (A.6). Noting

Hence the required inequality (8.7) is a consequence of (8.8) and the above estimate.
Therefore, the proof of the embedding (8.5) is completed.

the high frequency part of qV,M (·) is equivalent to that of pV,M (·), it follows that

In this section we prove Proposition 3.5. We utilize the theory of Lorentz spaces
[15, 42]). Let f be a measurable

and introduce the following notations (see e.g.
function on Ω. We deﬁne the non-increasing rearrangement of f as

f ∗(t) := inf{ c > 0 | mf (c) ≤ t },

where mf (c) is the distribution function of f which is deﬁned by the Lebesgue measure
of the set { x ∈ Rn | |f (x)| > c }. We deﬁne a function f ∗∗(t) on (0,∞) as

Note that

Lp,1(Ω) ֒→ Lp,q(Ω)
Lp(Ω) = Lp,∞(Ω)

necessity arises.

We prove Proposition 3.5 only for the homogeneous Besov spaces ˙Bs

p,q(AV ), since

the inhomogeneous case is proved in an analogous way.

We prepare the following four lemmas.

Lemma 9.1. Let 1 ≤ p0 < p < ∞ and 1 ≤ q ≤ ∞. Assume that V satisﬁes (1.1)
and (2.3). Then there exists a constant C > 0 such that

for all j ∈ Z and f ∈ Lp0(Ω).
Proof. It is suﬃcient to consider the case q = 1 due to the embedding (9.1). Let p1
be such that 1/p = 1/p0 + 1/p1 − 1. Then it follows from the Young inequality (9.4)
and the same argument as Lemma 4.1 that

for p1 > 1.

Here we note that the above constant C = C(p1) is ﬁnite if and only if p1 > 1, and
hence, we have to assume that p1 > 1, namely, p0 < p. The estimate for φj(√A0)f is
obtained in the same way. Thus the proof of of Lemma 9.1 is completed.
Lemma 9.2. Let {φj}j∈Z be deﬁned by (2.2). Assume that V satisﬁes (1.1), (2.3)
and (3.1). Let 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞. Then

Assume that V satisﬁes (1.1), (2.3) and (3.1). Then the following assertions hold:

Proof. We prove only (i), since the estimates (9.9) and (9.10) are obtained by the
duality argument for (9.8) and (9.7), respectively.

We ﬁrst consider the case n = 2 and p = 1. We note from Lemma 9.2 that

Φk(pA0)f = A−1

Thanks to the estimate (4.3) for α = 1 and the assumption (3.1) on V , a formal

This proves (9.8). Thus the estimate (i) for n = 2 and p = 1 is obtained.

T. IWABUCHI, T. MATSUYAMA, K. TANIGUCHI

In the case when n ≥ 3, we estimate by the use of the Lorentz spaces. As to the

(9.12) we estimate

kφk(pA0)Φj(pAV )fkLp ≤ C2−2kn22jkfkLp + kV Φj(pAV )fkLpo.

Here, it follows from the same argument as (9.14) and (9.15) that

Then, (9.8) is a consequence of the above two estimates. The proof of Lemma 9.3 is
complete.
(cid:3)

kV Φj(pAV )fkLp ≤ C22jkfkLp.

Lemma 9.4. Under the same assumptions as Lemma 9.3, the following assertions
hold:

(i) Let 1 ≤ p < ∞ and 0 ≤ α < min{2, n/p}. Then we have

for any j, k ∈ Z and f ∈ Lp(Ω).

(ii) Let 1 < p ≤ ∞ and 0 ≤ α < min{2, n(1 − 1/p)}. Then we have

kφj(pAV )Φk(pA0)fkLp ≤ C2−α(j−k)kfkLp,
kφk(pA0)Φj(pAV )fkLp ≤ C2−α(k−j)kfkLp.
kφj(pAV )Φk(pA0)fkLp ≤ C2−α(k−j)kfkLp,
kφk(pA0)Φj(pAV )fkLp ≤ C2−α(j−k)kfkLp.

for any j, k ∈ Z and f ∈ Lp(Ω).

Proof. The strategy of the proof is to apply the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem
to the estimates in Lemma 9.3 and the following uniform estimates:

kφj(pAV )Φk(pA0)fkLq ≤ CkfkLq,
kφk(pA0)Φj(pAV )fkLq ≤ CkfkLq,

for all j, k ∈ Z, which are proved by (4.3) for α = 0.

Let 0 ≤ α < min{2, n/p}. Then the proof of (9.16) for 1 ≤ p < n/2 is performed

This proves (9.16). In a similar way, by using (9.8) and (9.21), we get the estimate
(9.17). When n/2 ≤ p ≤ ∞, we apply the Riesz-Thorin interpolation theorem to
(9.20) with q = ∞ and the estimate (9.7) together with the argument (9.22).
Finally, estimates (9.18) and (9.19) are proved in analogous way as in (9.16) and
(9.17), if we divide the cases into n/(n − 2) < p ≤ ∞ and 1 ≤ p ≤ n/(n − 2). The
proof of Lemma 9.4 is complete.

(cid:3)

Remark. When (2.3) is not imposed on V , which is the assumption on the inhomo-
geneous Besov spaces, the same estimates in Lemmas 9.1–9.4 also hold for j, k ∈ N,
since the proof is done analogously by applying (4.2), (A.5) instead of (4.3), (A.6),
respectively.

In what follows, we prove the equivalence relation between ˙Bs

Summarizing (9.30)–(9.33), we conclude that the series (9.26) is absolutely conver-

In this case, the argument for s > 0 works well. The only diﬀer-

Let us now prove the inhomogeneous case.

The proof of (9.35) is similar to the homogeneous case. Indeed, as to the proof of

and (9.33) by taking the sum over j, k ∈ N. So we may omit the details. Thus we
conclude (9.35).

Appendix A. (Lp-boundedness, self-adjointness and pointwise

is very interesting. However, it is excluded from assumption (2.3) on V . The reason
is that the uniform boundedness in Proposition A.1 would not be generally obtained,
since

The proof of Proposition A.1 is similar to that of our previous works [19, 20] by us-
ing Lemmas A.2–A.4 below and we may omit the complete proof of Proposition A.1.
So, we shall concentrate on the proof of the self-adjointness of AV and the pointwise
estimate of integral kernel of e−tAV , which need certain adjustment to the method in
[20].

Let us prove that AV is self-adjoint on L2(Ω). Following the argument in [30] (see

also [19]), we consider the quadratic form q deﬁned by letting

q(u, v) :=ZΩ ∇u(x) · ∇v(x) dx +ZΩ
0 (Ω) | √V+u ∈ L2(Ω)}.

where Q(q) := {u ∈ H 1
Lemma A.2. Assume that the measurable potential V satisﬁes (1.1). Then there
exists a self-adjoint operator AV on L2(Ω) such that

V (x)u(x)v(x) dx,

u, v ∈ Q(q),

D(AV ) =(cid:26)u ∈ Q(q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ∃wu ∈ L2(Ω) s.t. ZΩ


for u ∈ D(AV ).

AV u = wu

AV ≥ −λ2
0I.

wuv dx = q(u, v) for all v ∈ Q(q)(cid:27) ,

Moreover, AV is semi-bounded, i.e., there exists a constant λ0 > 0 such that

Remark. We deﬁne AV u ∈ L2(Ω) for u ∈ Q(q) if u ∈ D(AV ). Then D(AV ) is
simply rewritten as

D(AV ) = {u ∈ Q(q) | AV u ∈ L2(Ω)}

= {u ∈ H 1

0 (Ω) |pV+u ∈ L2(Ω), AV u ∈ L2(Ω)}.

This is nothing but the identity (1.2) given in §1.

To prove Lemma A.2, we need the following lemma.

Lemma A.3. ([9, 19, 34]) Assume that V− is in the Kato class Kn(Ω). Then for any
ε > 0 there exists λ0 > 0 such that

0 (Ω).

for any f ∈ H 1
Proof. By the density argument, we may take f ∈ C ∞
zero extension of f and V− to Rn, respectively. Then (A.3) is equivalent to

0 (Ω). Let ˜f and ˜V− be the

ZRn

˜V−(x)| ˜f (x)|2 dx ≤ εk∇ ˜fk2

L2(Rn) + λ2

0k ˜fk2

L2(Rn).

Since this inequality is proved in [9, 34], we may omit the details. The proof of
Lemma A.3 is ﬁnished.
(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma A.2. It suﬃces to show that the quadratic form q is closed and
semi-bounded by Theorem VIII.15 in [30] (see also Lemma 2.3 in [19]). We ﬁrst show
that q is closed. Put

q1(u, v) =ZΩ ∇u(x) · ∇v(x) dx −ZΩ
q2(u, v) =ZΩ

V+(x)u(x)v(x) dx,

Then we get

V−(x)u(x)v(x) dx,

u, v ∈ Q(q1) := H 1
u, v ∈ Q(q2) := {u ∈ L2(Ω) |pV+u ∈ L2(Ω)}.

0 (Ω),

q(u, v) = q1(u, v) + q2(u, v),

u, v ∈ Q(q) = Q(q1) ∩ Q(q2).

Since q1 is closed (see Proposition 2.1 in [19]) and the sum of two closed quadratic
forms is also closed, it is enough to show that q2 is closed.

We show that q2 is closed. Put q2(u) = q2(u, u) for simplicity. Assume that
u ∈ L2(Ω),

kuj − ukL2 → 0 as j, k → ∞,

q2(uj − uk) → 0,

uj ∈ Q(q2),

and we prove that

u ∈ Q(q2)

(A.4)
j=1 is a Cauchy sequence in L2(Ω), there exists v ∈ L2(Ω) such that

and q2(uj − u) → 0

in L2(Ω).

j=1 converges to v almost everywhere along a subse-

pV+uj → v

quence denoted by the same, namely,

Since {√V+uj}∞
Hence the sequence {√V+uj}∞
pV+uj(x) → v(x)
pV+uj(x) →pV+u(x)

for almost every x ∈ Ω as j → ∞.

On the other hand, since any convergent sequence in L2(Ω) contains a subsequence
which converges almost everywhere in Ω, it follows that

for almost every x ∈ Ω as j → ∞.

Summarizing three convergences obtained now, we get √V+u = v ∈ L2(Ω). This
Finally we prove that q is semi-bounded. Let u ∈ D(AV ). By the estimate (A.3),

proves (A.4).

for any ε > 0 there exists λ0 > 0 such that

Taking ε = 1, we obtain

which implies that q is semi-bounded. This ends the proof of Lemma A.2.

(cid:3)

As to the pointwise estimate on the kernel of e−tAV , we have the following.

Lemma A.4. The integral kernel e−tAV (x, y) of the semi-group {e−tAV }t≥0 enjoys
the following estimates:

(i) Assume that V satisﬁes (1.1). Then there exist constants ω, C > 0 such that

|e−tAV (x, y)| ≤ Ceωtt− n

Ct (cid:17)
2 exp(cid:16) − |x − y|2
Ct (cid:17) if 0 < t ≤ 1.

2 exp(cid:16) − |x − y|2

for any t > 0 and x, y ∈ Ω. In particular, we have

|e−tAV (x, y)| ≤ Ct− n

(A.5)

(A.6)

(ii) Assume that V satisﬁes (1.1) and (2.3). Then there exists C > 0 such that

|e−tAV (x, y)| ≤ Ct− n

Ct (cid:17)
2 exp(cid:16) − |x − y|2

for any t > 0 and x, y ∈ Ω.

Proof. Since the assertions (i) with n ≥ 1 and (ii) with n = 1, 2 were already proved
in [26], it is enough to show (ii) in the case when n ≥ 3. We prove the lemma for
n ≥ 3 in a formal way for the sake of simplicity. For more rigorous argument, see
[19, 20].

Put

It is proved in Proposition 3.1 from [19] that if V∗ satisﬁes assumption (2.3), then

V∗ := −V−.

|e−tAV∗ (x, y)| ≤ Ct− n

2 e− |x−y|2

Ct

for t > 0,

x, y ∈ Ω.

Once the following inequality

is proved, the proof of the lemma is complete. So, we prove (A.7). Let

|e−tAV (x, y)| ≤ |e−tAV∗ (x, y)|

(A.7)

u(1)(t) := e−tAV∗ f,
u(t) := u(1)(t) − u(2)(t),

u(2)(t) := e−tAV f,
u−(t) := − min{u(t), 0},

− (t) = 0 in L2(Ω)

− (0) = 0. Therefore, we get
0 ≤ e−tAV f ≤ e−tAV∗ f.

For each point x0 ∈ Ω, by taking f = fk (k = 1, 2,· · · ) which tend to the delta
function supported at x0, we see that the kernel of e−tAV is bounded by that of
e−tAV∗ . Thus (A.7) is proved. This ends the proof of Lemma A.4.

In this appendix we prove that zero is not an eigenvalue of AV .

To prove Lemma B.1, we need the following lemma.

(B.3)

f ∈ D(AV ) and AV f = 0 in L2(Ω),

then f = 0. Indeed, we ﬁnd from Lemma B.2 and assumption (B.3) that

0 (Ω). Finally, the above inequality
also implies that AV is non-negative on L2(Ω). When n = 1, 2, it follows that V− = 0,
and hence, we conclude from (B.4) that k∇fkL2 = 0. Thus we get f = 0 also in this
case. This ends the proof of Lemma B.1.
