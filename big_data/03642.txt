Abstract

In this paper, we are concerned with sample path properties of isotropic
spherical Gaussian ﬁelds on S2. In particular, we establish the property of
strong local nondeterminism of an isotropic spherical Gaussian ﬁeld based
on the high-frequency behaviour of its angular power spectrum; we then
exploit this result to establish an exact uniform modulus of continuity for
its sample paths. We also discuss the range of values of the spectral index
for which the sample functions exhibit fractal or smooth behaviour.

Key words: Spherical Gaussian ﬁelds, strong local nondeterminism, uni-

form modulus of continuity, spherical wavelets.

1 Introduction and Overview

1.1 Motivations

The analysis of sample path properties of random ﬁelds has been considered by
many authors, see, for instance, [4, 7, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 30, 31] and their

combined references. These papers have covered a wide variety of circumstances,
including scalar and vector valued random ﬁelds, isotropic and anisotropic be-
haviour, analytic and geometric properties. The parameter space of the random
ﬁelds in these references, however, has been typically considered to be Euclidean,
i.e., Rk, for k ≥ 1.
From the point of view of applications, however, there is of course a lot
of interest in investigating sample path properties of random ﬁelds deﬁned on
manifolds. In particular, we shall focus here on isotropic random ﬁelds deﬁned
on the unit sphere S2; these ﬁelds have considerable mathematical interest by
themselves, and arise very naturally in a number of scientiﬁc areas, i.e., geo-
physics, astrophysics and cosmology, athmospheric sciences, image analysis, to
name only a few, see [17] for a systematic account. To the best of our knowl-
edge, very little is currently known on the sample path properties of these ﬁelds,
even under Gaussianity and Isotropy assumptions; the only currently available
references seem to be [11, 13], which investigate diﬀerentiability and H¨older
continuity properties of the sample functions in terms of the so-called spectral
index, to be deﬁned below.

Our aim in this paper is to pursue this line of investigation further and to
provide two main results. The ﬁrst of these results is to establish a property
of strong local nondeterminism for a large class of isotropic spherical Gaussian
ﬁelds. In the Euclidean setting, the notion of strong local nondeterminism has
played a pivotal role to establish a number of characterizations for sample tra-
jectories, see again [22, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32] for more discussions and review of
recent papers; we thus believe that our result will open a way for similar de-
velopments in the area of spherical Gaussian ﬁelds. In particular, by exploiting
this property, we are able to establish our second main result, i.e. the exact
uniform modulus of continuity for isotropic spherical Gaussian ﬁelds. The ex-
act form of the scaling depends in a very explicit way on the behaviour of the
angular power spectrum (to be recalled below) of the ﬁeld, and we can hence
identify the class of models that lead to fractal properties. In oder to state more
precisely these results, we need to introduce however some more notation and
background material, which we do in the following subsection.

1.2 Background and notation

We start by recalling some background from [17] on second order spherical
random ﬁelds, by which we mean as usual measurable applications T : Ω× S2 →
R, where {Ω,ℑ, P} is some probability space, such that for all x ∈ S2,

E(cid:0)T 2(x, ω)(cid:1) =ZΩ

T 2(x, ω)dP(ω) < ∞.

Without loss of generality, in the sequel we shall always assume the ﬁeld to

that the random ﬁelds T = {T (x), x ∈ S2} and T g = {T (gx), x ∈ S2} have
the same law, for all rotations g ∈ SO(3). T is called 2-weakly isotropic if

have zero-mean, E(cid:0)T (x, ω)(cid:1) = 0. Also, as usual, by (strong) isotropy we mean
E(cid:0)T (x)T (y)(cid:1) = E(cid:0)T (gx)T (gy)(cid:1) for all g ∈ SO(3).

2

Given a 2-weakly isotropic random ﬁeld T = {T (x), x ∈ S2}, the following

spectral representation is well known to hold (cf. [17, Theorem 5.13 ]):

T (x; ω) =

∞Xℓ=0

ℓXm=−ℓ

aℓm(ω)Yℓm(x),

(1)

where {Yℓm, ℓ ≥ 0; m = 0,±1, . . . ,±ℓ} are the spherical harmonic functions on
every ﬁxed x, and in L2(Ω × S2), i.e.

S2 and aℓm = RS2 T (x)Yℓm(x) dx. The equality in (1) holds both in L2(Ω) at

lim
L→∞

E(cid:20)T (x) −
E(cid:20)ZS2(cid:18)T (x; ω) −

LXℓ Xm
LXℓ Xm

aℓm(ω)Yℓm(x)(cid:21)2
aℓm(ω)Yℓm(x)(cid:19)2

dx(cid:21) = 0.

and

lim
L→∞

matically entails the mean-square continuity; the spectral representation hence
follows without further assumptions, see [17, 18].

We recall that the ﬁnite-variance condition E(cid:0)T 2(x)(cid:1) < ∞ under isotropy auto-
If T = {T (x), x ∈ S2} is a Gaussian random ﬁeld, then its strong isotropy
and 2-weak isotropy are equivalent. The distribution of an isotropic zero-mean
Gaussian ﬁeld T = {T (x), x ∈ S2} is fully characterized by the covariance func-
tion E(cid:0)T (x)T (y)(cid:1). By a theorem of Schoenberg [24], the latter can be expanded
as follows:

E(cid:0)T (x)T (y)(cid:1) =

∞Xℓ=0

2ℓ + 1

CℓPℓ(hx, yi);

(2)

4π

[−1, 1] → R, for ℓ = 1, 2, ..., denote the Legendre
here, P0 ≡ 1 and Pℓ :
polynomials, which satisfy the normalization condition Pℓ(1) = 1 and can be
recovered by Rodrigues’ formula as

Pℓ(t) =

1

2ℓℓ!

dℓ
dtℓ (t2 − 1)ℓ,

ℓ = 1, 2, ...

On the other hand, the sequence {Cℓ, ℓ = 0, 1, ...} of nonnegative weights repre-
sents the so-called angular power spectrum of the ﬁeld, and the ℓ’s are referred to
as frequencies (also labelled multipoles). In terms of the spectral representation,
we have the identiﬁcation

E(cid:0)aℓmaℓ′m′(cid:1) = Cℓδℓ′

ℓ δm′
m ,

(3)

so that the angular power spectrum provides the variance of the (uncorrelated)
Gaussian random coeﬃcients {aℓm, ℓ = 0, 1, 2, ...; m = −ℓ, ..., ℓ} . By standard
Fourier arguments, the small scale behaviour of the covariance is determined
by the behavior of the angular power spectrum at high frequencies; namely, the
behavior of Cℓ for as ℓ → ∞.

3

It is known that for ℓ = 0, Y00(x) in (1) is a constant function on S2, which
does not aﬀect the sample path regularity of T (x). Hence, for simplicity of
notation, we will remove the term for ℓ = m = 0 from (1) and (2) (i.e., we
consider T (x) − a00Y00(x)) throughout the rest of this paper. Furthermore,
we shall impose the following condition on the behavior of the angular power
spectrum, which we consider in every respect as minimal.

Condition (A): The random ﬁeld T = {T (x) , x ∈ S2} is zero-mean, Gaussian
and isotropic, with angular power spectrum such that:

Cℓ = G (ℓ) ℓ−α > 0, ∀ ℓ = 1, 2, ...,

(4)

where α > 2 is a constant and, moreover, there exists a ﬁnite constant c0 ≥ 1,
such that

c−1
0 ≤ G (ℓ) ≤ c0.

(recall the identity E(cid:0)T 2(x)(cid:1) =Pℓ

The assumption α > 2 is necessary to ensure that the ﬁeld has ﬁnite variance
2ℓ+1
4π Cℓ). On the other hand, we stress that
we are imposing no regularity condition on the function G(ℓ), on the contrary
of much of the literature on spherical random ﬁelds, which typically requires
limℓ→∞ G(ℓ) = const. or other forms of additional regularity conditions (see
i.e., [3, 12, 19, 20]). We believe that Condition (A) covers the vast majority
of models which seems of interest from a theoretical or applied point of view;
for instance, it ﬁts very well with the theoretical and observational evidence on
Cosmic Microwave Background radiation data (see [5, 6, 23]), which has been
one of the main motivating areas for the analysis of spherical ﬁelds over the last
decade. Most of our results to follow will depend in a simple analytic way from
the value of the parameter α, which we refer to as the spectral index of T .

1.3 Statement of the Main Results

To introduce our ﬁrst main result (on strong local nondeterminism), we need
ﬁrst to introduce some more notation. In particular, for α > 2, let ρα : R+ → R+
be the continuous function deﬁned by

ρα (t) =

t(α−2)/2,

tp| log t|,

t,

if 2 < α < 4,
if α = 4,
if α > 4

(5)

and ρα(0) = 0 for all values of α. In the above and in the sequel, log x = ln(x∨e)
for all x > 0. As we shall show later, up to a constant factor the functions ρα
can be related to the canonical (Dudley) metric for the Gaussian processes to
be investigated; it is important to note the explicit dependence on the spectral
index α. As usual, we take

dS2 (x, y) = arccos(hx, yi)

4

as the standard spherical (or geodesic) distance on S2. The following result
establishes the property of strong local nondeterminism for spherical Gaussian
ﬁelds satisfying Condition (A) with 2 < α < 4.

Theorem 1 Let T = {T (x), x ∈ S2} be an isotropic Gaussian ﬁeld that satis-
ﬁes Condition (A) with 2 < α < 4. There exist positive and ﬁnite constants
c2 and ε0 such that for all integers n ≥ 1 and all x0, x1, ..., xn ∈ S2 with

min1≤k≤n dS2(cid:0)x0, xk(cid:1) ≤ ε0 we have

Var (T (x0)|T (x1) , ..., T (xn)) ≥ c2 min

1≤k≤n

ρα (dS2 (x0, xk))2 .

(6)

The proof of Theorem 1 is presented in Section 3. The argument does not
seem to work for the critical case of α = 4, we expect that (6) still holds, but a
new method may be needed.

In the following we simply note how the strong local nondeterminism prop-
erty can be exploited to develop a number of nontrivial characterizations for
the sample path behaviour of spherical random ﬁelds. Among these characteri-
zations, in this paper we shall focus on the uniform modulus of continuity, for
which we shall establish the following result, which signiﬁcantly improves the
H¨older continuity established by Lang and Schwab [13, Theorem 4.5].

Theorem 2 Let T = {T (x), x ∈ S2} be an isotropic Gaussian ﬁeld that satisﬁes
Condition (A).

(i). If 2 < α < 4, then there exists a positive and ﬁnite constant K1 such that,

with probability one

lim
ε→0

sup

x,y∈S2,

dS2 (x,y)<ε

|T (x) − T (y)|

ρα (dS2 (x, y))q(cid:12)(cid:12) log ρα (dS2 (x, y))(cid:12)(cid:12)

= K1.

(7)

(ii). If α = 4, then there exists a positive and ﬁnite constant K2 such that, with

probability one

lim
ε→0

sup

x,y∈S2,

dS2 (x,y)<ε

|T (x) − T (y)|

dS2 (x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) log dS2 (x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ K2.

(8)

The proof of Theorem 2 will be given in Section 4.

In the following, we

provide some remarks.

• In terms of the geodesic distance, the results (7) and (8) can be clearly

written as

ε→0

sup

x,y∈S2,

dS2 (x,y)<ε

K1, for 2 < α < 4.

• It is important to note the fractal behaviour that occurs for 2 < α < 4,
when the modulus of continuity decays slower than linearly with respect to
the angular distance (hence the sample function T (x) is nondiﬀerentiable).
We note that this range of values of α is typical for many applied ﬁelds, for
instance for Cosmic Microwave Background data α is known to be very
close to 2, from theoretical arguments and from experimental data (see
e.g., [23]).

• For the case of α = 4, (8) implies that the sample function T (x) is almost
Lipschitz. We believe the equality in (8) actually holds and the sample
function presents subtle fractal properties. However, we have not been
able to prove these results, due to the unsolved case in Theorem 1.

2 − k.

Next we consider the case of α > 4. Let k ≥ 1 be the unique integer such
that 2 + 2k < α < 4 + 2k. It follows from Lang and Schwab [13, Theorem 4.6]
that T = {T (x), x ∈ S2} has a modiﬁcation, still denoted by T , such that its
sample function is almost surely k-times continuously diﬀerentiable. Moreover,
the k-th (partial) derivatives of T (x) are H¨older continuous on S2 with exponent
γ < α−2

In the following, we adapt the approach of Lang and Schwab [13] (see also
[11]) to study the regularity properties of higher-order derivatives of T based
on pseudo-diﬀerential operators, as described in the classical monograph [27].
In particular, for real k ∈ R introduce (1 − ∆S2 )k/2 as the pseudo-diﬀerential
operator whose action on functions T (·) ∈ L2(S2) is deﬁned by
aℓm(1 + ℓ(ℓ + 1))k/2Yℓm,

(9)

(1 − ∆S2 )k/2T :=Xℓm

provided the right-hand side converges in L2(Ω× S2). In the above, {aℓm} is the
same sequence of random variables as in (1), and ∆S2 is the spherical Laplacian,
also called Laplace-Beltrami operator which, in spherical coordinates (ϑ, ϕ), is
deﬁned by 0 ≤ ϑ ≤ π, 0 ≤ ϕ < 2π,

∆S2 =

sin ϑ

∂ϑ(cid:26)sin ϑ

∂ϑ(cid:27) +

sin2 ϑ

∂ϑ2 .

(10)

Recall that for every x ∈ S2, it can be written as x = (sin ϑ cos ϕ, sin ϑ sin ϕ, cos ϑ).
In this paper, with slight abuse of notation, we always identify the Cartesian
and angular coordinates of the point x ∈ S2.
It is shown in [27, Chapter XI] that the Sobolev space W k,2(S2) of func-
tions with square-integrable k-th derivatives can be viewed as the image of
L2(S2) under the operator (1 − ∆S2 )−k/2; this and related property are ex-
ploited by Lang and Schwab [13] to prove their Theorem 4.6 on regularity of
higher-order derivatives. More precisely, consider the Gaussian random ﬁeld
T (k) = {T (k)(x), x ∈ S2} deﬁned by

T (k) := (1 − ∆S2 )k/2T.

6

Lang and Schwab [13] study the almost-sure H¨older continuity of T (k). We are
able to improve their results by considering the exact modulus of continuity, for
which we provide the following result.

Theorem 3 If in Condition (A), 2 + 2k < α ≤ 4 + 2k for some integer k ≥
1, then T (k) = {T (k)(x), x ∈ S2} satisﬁes the following uniform modulus of
continuity:

(i). If 2 + 2k < α < 4 + 2k, then there exists a positive and ﬁnite constant K3

such that

lim
ε→0

sup

x,y∈S2,

dS2 (x,y)≤ε

|T (k)(x) − T (k)(y)|

ρα−2k (dS2 (x, y))q(cid:12)(cid:12) log ρα−2k (dS2 (x, y))(cid:12)(cid:12)

= K3,

a.s.

(ii). If α = 4 + 2k, then there exists a positive and ﬁnite constant K4 such that

lim
ε→0

sup

x,y∈S2,

dS2 (x,y)<ε

|T (k)(x) − T (k)(y)|

dS2 (x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) log dS2 (x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ K4,

a.s.

1.4 Plan of the Paper

The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we introduce some auxiliary
tools that will be instrumental for our proofs to follow; in particular, a careful
analysis of the variogram/covariance function on very small scales, and the con-
struction of the so-called spherical bump function, i.e. a compactly supported
function on the sphere satisfying some required smoothness conditions. The
latter construction builds upon ideas discussed by Geller and Mayeli [8, 9] in
the framework of spherical wavelets. In Section 3, we exploit these results to es-
tablish the property of strong local nondeterminism for a large class of isotropic
spherical Gaussian ﬁelds. In Section 4, by applying Gaussian techniques and
strong local nondeterminism we prove Theorem 2 on the exact uniform modu-
lus of continuity; while an extension to higher-order derivatives is discussed in
Section 5. Some auxiliary results are collected in the Appendix.

2 Technical Tools

2.1 The Variogram

It is well-known that, for the investigation of sample properties of Gaussian ﬁeld
T = {T (x), x ∈ S2}, it is important to introduce the canonical metric

dT (x, y) =qE(cid:0)|T (x) − T (y)|2(cid:1),

see for instance [1, 16] or any other monograph on the modern theory of Gaussian
processes. The square of the canonical metric is also known as the variogram of

7

T . Our ﬁrst technical result is a careful investigation on the behaviour of this
metric for pairs of points that are very close in the spherical distance dS2 (·,·);
more precisely, we have the following upper and lower bounds, in terms of the
function ρα which was introduced in (5).

Lemma 4 Under Condition (A), there exist constants 1 ≤ c1 < ∞ and 0 <
ε < 1, such that for all x, y ∈ S2 with dS2 (x, y) ≤ ε, we have

c−1
1 ρ2

α (dS2 (x, y)) ,

α (dS2 (x, y)) ≤ d2

T (x, y) ≤ c1ρ2

where ρα (·) : [0, π] → R+ is deﬁned in (5).
Proof. From (2), it is readily seen that

d2

T (x, y) = E(cid:0)|T (x) − T (y)|2(cid:1) =

Cℓ

∞Xℓ=1

2ℓ + 1

2π (cid:0)1 − Pℓ (cos θ)(cid:1),

where we write for notational convenience θ = θxy = dS2 (x, y). Let

(12)

Qα (θ) =

∞Xℓ=1

ℓ−α(cid:16)ℓ +

1

2(cid:17)(cid:0)1 − Pℓ (cos θ)(cid:1).

Schoenberg’s theorem in [24] implies that, for every ℓ ≥ 1, Pℓ(hx, yi) is a co-
variance function on S2. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives |Pℓ (cos θ)| ≤
Pℓ (1) = 1. Hence, it follows from Condition (A) that

c−1
0
π

Qα (θ) ≤ d2

T (x, y) ≤

π

Qα (θ) .

(13)

The statement is then derived by exploiting Lemma 10 in the Appendix, which
provides a full characterization on the small scale behaviour of Qα (θ) as θ → 0.

Remark 5 Anticipating some results to follow, it is important to stress the
phase transition that occurs in the behaviour of the canonical metric as a func-
tion of α. For α > 4, the canonical metric is proportional to the standard geodesic
distance; for 2 < α < 4, on the contrary, the ratio between geodesic and canon-
ical distance diverges on small scales and fractal behaviour occurs. The case of
α = 4 is, in some sense, critical and an extra logarithmic factor appears in the
bounds for the variogram in Lemma 4.

2.2 The Construction of the Spherical Bump Function

In this section, we work with spherical coordinates (ϑ, ϕ), 0 ≤ ϑ ≤ π, 0 ≤ ϕ <
2π, and we review the construction of a family of zonal functions δε : S2 →
R, ε > 0, which shall vanish outside a spherical cap around the North Pole
ϑ = ϕ = 0 (we recall that a zonal function satisﬁes by deﬁnition the identity

8

δε(ϑ, ϕ) = δε(ϑ, ϕ′) for all ϕ,ϕ′ ∈ [0, 2π)). The construction follows a proposal
by Geller and Mayeli ([8], Lemma 4.1, pages 16-17), see also [9]; we introduce
some minimal modiﬁcations, to ensure a suitable rate of decay in the spherical
harmonic coeﬃcients. More precisely, we shall show that for all ε > 0, there
exists a zonal function

δε(ϑ, ϕ) :=

∞Xℓ=1

bℓ(ε)

2ℓ + 1

4π

Pℓ(cos ϑ) =

∞Xℓ=1

ℓXm=−ℓ

κℓm(ε)Yℓm(ϑ, ϕ)

(14)

such that for some positive and ﬁnite constants c2 and c3, we have

ε2δε(ϑ, ϕ) ≤ c2
δε(ϑ, ϕ) = 0 for all ϑ > ε

for all 0 ≤ ϑ ≤ π, 0 ≤ ϕ < 2π;

and

δε(0, 0) ∼ c3ε−2 as ε → 0.

(15)

(16)

Moreover the coeﬃcients {bℓ(ε), κℓm(ε)} can be taken such that they satisfy

|bℓ(ε)| ≤ c4,
|κℓ0(ε)| ≤ c5 √2ℓ + 1

κℓm(ε) = 0 for m 6= 0, and

(17)

for all integers ℓ ≥ 1, where c4 and c5 are positive and ﬁnite constants.
It is natural to label δε(·,·) a spherical bump function, in analogy with the
analogous constructions on the Euclidean domains. On the other hand, up to
a diﬀerent normalization factor the function δε(·,·) is just a special case of the
so-called Mexican needlet frame by [8], in the special case where the latter has
bounded support in the real domain. We hence follow as much as possible the
notation by these authors.

(ii). It is piecewise continuously diﬀerentiable up to order M , where M is large

In particular, we choose a function bG(·) : R → R such that it satisﬁes the
(i). suppbG(·) ⊆ (−1, 1),
(iii). Its inverse Fourier transform G satisﬁes 0 <R ∞
For example, we can take bG(·) = p ⋆ p(·), where p(s) = max{0, 1 − 2|s|}. Then
bG(·) is piecewise smooth and its inverse Fourier transform is G(u) = ( 2
π )2(1 −
cos(u/2))2u−4. Functions G(u) with faster decay rate of as u → ∞ can be
constructed by convoluting more times.
As in Geller and Mayeli [8], we consider the operator G(ε√−∆S2 ) : L2(S2) →

0 G(u)udu < ∞.

following conditions:

L2(S2) deﬁned by

G(εp−∆S2 ) :=Z ∞

−∞ bG(s) exp(−isεp−∆S2) ds;

recall that ∆S2 is the spherical Laplacian in (10). The action of this operator is
described as usual by means of the corresponding kernel; i.e., for any f ∈ L2(S2)
we have

where

Kε(x, y) :=

for ℓ = 1, 2, . . . and m = −ℓ, . . . , ℓ.; see i.e, [17], Chapter 3.
(ϑ, ϕ) an arbitrary point on the sphere, and deﬁne

Under this assumptions, we take x = N = (0, 0) (the “North Pole”), y =

δε(ϑ, ϕ) := Kε(N, y).

Then the ﬁrst inequality in (15) follows from an application of Lemma 4.1 in
[8] to the case of M = S2 (hence n = 2, d(x, y) = dS2 (N, y) = ϑ), t = ε and
j, k, N = 0. The second statement in (15), namely, suppδε ⊆ {(ϑ, ϕ) : ϑ ≤ ε}
follows from Huygens’ principle as in the proof of Lemma 4.1 in [8, page 911].
To verify (16), we use the deﬁnition of K in (18) to verify that as ε → 0,

with c3 = (2π)−1R ∞

which gives the desired representation in (14).

We end this section with some further properties of the spherical bump

3 Strong Local Nondeterminism: Proof of The-

orem 1

We are now in the position to prove Theorem 1. Recall that T = {T (x), x ∈
S2} is an isotropic Gaussian random ﬁeld with mean zero and angular power
spectrum {Cℓ} . We prove the following more general theorem which implies
Theorem 1 when 2 < α < 4. For α ≥ 4, the lower bound given by (22) is
strictly smaller than ρ2
α(ε). Lemma 4 indicates that (22) can be improved if
n = 1. However, it is not known if one can strengthen (22) for all n ≥ 2.

11

Theorem 6 Under Condition (A), there exist positive and ﬁnite constants ε0
and c2 such that for all ε ∈ (0, ε0], all integers n ≥ 1 and all x0, x1, ..., xn ∈ S2,
satisfying dS2 (x0, xk) ≥ ε, we have

Var (T (x0)|T (x1) , ..., T (xn)) ≥ c2εα−2.

(22)

Proof. As before, we work in spherical coordinates (ϑ, ϕ) and we take without
loss of generality x0 = (0, 0) to be the North Pole, and xk = (ϑk, ϕk) so that
dS2 (x, xk) = ϑk. To establish (22), it is suﬃcient to prove that there exists a
positive constant c2 such that for all choices of real numbers γ1, ..., γn, we have

E(cid:26)(cid:18)T (0) −
nXj=1
γjT (xj)(cid:19)2(cid:27) = E(cid:26)(cid:18)Xℓm

It follows from (1), (2) or (3) that

Hence, (23) is a consequence of Proposition 7 below.

Proposition 7 Assume Condition (A) holds. For all ε ∈ (0, ε0], there exists
a constant c2 > 0 such that for all choices of n ∈ N, all (ϑj, ϕj) : ϑj > ε, and
γj ∈ R, j = 1, 2, ..., n, we have

Proof. For any ﬁxed ε > 0, let δε(·,·) be deﬁned as in (14), with the cor-
(17), (19), (20) and (21) hold. Now we consider

responding coeﬃcients(cid:8)bℓm(ε)(cid:9) and(cid:8)κℓm(ε)(cid:9) such that conditions (15), (16),

Remark 8 At this stage we can draw an analogy between the isotropic spherical
random ﬁelds satisfying Condition (A) with 2 < α < 4 and a fractional Brown-
ian ﬁeld with self-similarity parameter H. The analogy can be made clearer by
setting the parameter values so that 2H + 2 = α, and Lemma 4 shows that the
variogram of T = {T (x), x ∈ S2} is of the order dS2 (x, y)2H = dS2 (x, y)α−2. This
indicates that T shares many analytic and fractal properties with a fractional
Brownian ﬁeld with parameter H. Indeed, by applying Lemma 4 and Theorem
1, we can prove that, for any u ∈ R, the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the level set
T −1(u) is given by

dimH T −1(u) = 2 −

α − 2

2

,

a.s.,

which shows that for 2 < α < 4 we have a fractal curve of Hausdorﬀ dimension
∈ (1, 2).
Notice that, dimH T −1(u) = 1 when α ≥ 4, but the nature of the level curve
is diﬀerent for α > 4 and α = 4, respectively. For α > 4, the sample function
T (x) is diﬀerentiable. Thus its level curve T −1(u) is regular. While for α = 4
we believe that the level curve is not diﬀerentiable and possesses subtle fractal
properties. Investigation of the topological and geometric properties of T −1(u)
and more general excursion sets in more details is left for future research.

4 Modulus of continuity: Proof of Theorem 2

We start by state 0-1 laws regarding the uniform and local moduli of continuity
for an isotropic spherical Gaussian ﬁeld T = {T (x), x ∈ S2}. It is a consequence
of the representation (1) and Kolmogorov’s 0-1 law. We ﬁrst rewrite Lemma
7.1.1 in Marcus and Rosen [16] as follows.

Lemma 9 Let {T (x), x ∈ S2} be a centered Gaussian random ﬁeld on S2. Let
ϕ : R+ → R+ be a function with ϕ(0+) = 0. Then

|T (x) − T (y)|
ϕ(dS2 (x, y)) ≤ K, a.s.

ϕ(dS2 (x, y))

for some constant K ′ < ∞.

Proof of Theorem 2. Because of Lemma 9, we see that (7) in Theorem 2
will be proved after we establish upper and lower bounds of the following form:
If 2 < α < 4, then there exist positive and ﬁnite constants K5 and K6 such that

lim
ε→0

sup

x,y∈S2,
d(x,y)≤ε

dS2 (x, y)(α−2)/2q(cid:12)(cid:12) log dS2 (x, y)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≥ K6,

a.s.

(29)

We divide the rest of the proof of Theorem 2 into three parts.
Step 1: Proof of (28). We introduce an auxiliary Gaussian ﬁeld:

Y = {Y (x, y), x, y ∈ S2, dS2(x, y) ≤ ε}

deﬁned by Y (x, y) = T (x) − T (y), where ε > 0 is small so that (11) in Lemma
4 holds. The canonical metric dY on Γ := {(x, y) ∈ S2 × S2 : dS2 (x, y) ≤ ε}
associated with Y satisﬁes the following inequality:

dY ((x, y), (x′, y′)) ≤ min{dT (x, x′) + dT (y, y′), dT (x, y) + dT (x′, y′)}.
Denote the diameter of Γ in the metric dY by D. Then, by (30), we have

(30)

D ≤ sup

(x,y)∈Γ

(dT (x, y) + dT (x′, y′)) ≤ 2ε.

For any η > 0, let NY (Γ, η) be the smallest number of open dY -balls of radius
η needed to cover Γ. It follows from (30) that for 2 < α < 4,

NY (Γ, η) ≤ K7η− 4

α−2 ,

for some positive and ﬁnite constant K7, and one can verify that

Z D
0 plog NY (T, η) dη ≤ K εplog(1 + ε−1).

Hence, by Theorem 1.3.5 in [1], we have

S2 (x,y)≤ε

|T (x) − T (y)|

ε(α−2)/2p| log ε| ≤ K,

a.s.

for some ﬁnite constant K. One can verify (cf. Lemma 7.1.6 in [16]) that this
implies (28).

Step 2: Proof of (29). For any n ≥ ⌊| log2 ε0|⌋ + 1, where ε0 is as in Theorem
6, we chose a sequence of 2n points {xn,i, 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n} on S2 that are equally
separated in the following sense: For every 2 ≤ k ≤ 2n, we have
dS2 (xn,k, xn,i) = dS2 (xn,k, xn,k−1) = 2−n.

(31)

There are many ways to choose such a sequence on S2. Notice that

It is suﬃcient to prove that, almost surely, the last limit in (32) is bounded
below by a positive constant. This is done by applying the property of strong
local nondeterminism in Theorem 6 and a standard Borel-Cantelli argument.

Let η > 0 be a constant whose value will be chosen later. We consider the

and write

where eA2n−1 =(cid:8) max2≤k≤2n−1(cid:12)(cid:12)T (xn,k) − T (xn,k−1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ η2−n(α−2)/2√n(cid:9). The

Step 3: Proof of (8) for α = 4. This is similar to the proof in Step 1, except

P(cid:0)An(cid:1) <
By taking η > 0 small enough such that c2η2 < 2, we have P∞
that the diameter D of Γ in the metric dY is now comparable to Kεp| log ε|

Theorem 2.

5 Higher-Order Derivatives: Proof of Theorem

3

Now we consider the case of α > 4. Let k ≥ 1 be the integer such that 2 + 2k <
α ≤ 4 + 2k, and let T (k) = {T (k)(x), x ∈ S2} be the Gaussian random ﬁeld
deﬁned by T (k) = (1 − ∆S2 )k/2T. It follows from (9) that T (k) is again isotropic
and its angular power spectrum is given by

eCℓ = E(cid:0)|aℓm|2(cid:1)(1 + ℓ(ℓ + 1))k = Cℓ(1 + ℓ(ℓ + 1))k,

Under Condition (A), we have eCℓ = eG (ℓ) ℓ2k−α for all ℓ = 1, 2, ..., where

ℓ = 1, 2, ...

c−1

6 ≤ eG (ℓ) ≤ c6

for some ﬁnite constant c6 ≥ 1. It follows from Theorem 1 that, for all n ≥ 1
and all x0, x1, . . . , xn ∈ S2 such that min1≤i≤n dS2 (x0, xi) ≤ ε0, we have

Var(cid:16)T (k) (x0)|T (k) (x1) , ..., T (k) (xn)(cid:17) ≥ c2 min

Hence the conclusions of Theorem 3 follow from Theorem 2.

instrumental to investigate the behaviour of the canonical Gaussian metric at
small angular distances, in terms of the spectral index α.
