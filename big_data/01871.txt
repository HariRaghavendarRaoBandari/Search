Abstract: Consider two diﬀerent portfolios which have claims triggered by the same events. Their corresponding
collective model over a ﬁxed time period is given in terms of individual claim sizes (Xi, Yi), i ≥ 1 and a claim counting
random variable N . In this paper we are concerned with the joint distribution function F of the largest claim sizes
(XN :N , YN :N ). By allowing N to depend on some parameter, say θ, then F = F (θ) is for various choices of N a
tractable parametric family of bivariate distribution functions. We present three applications of the implied paramet-
ric models to some data from the literature and a new data set from a Swiss insurance company 1. Furthermore, we
investigate both distributional and asymptotic properties of (XN :N , YN :N ).

Key Words: Largest claims; copula; loss and ALAE; max-stable distribution; estimation; parametric family.

1. Introduction

Consider the classical collective model over a ﬁxed time period of two insurance portfolios with (Xi, Yi) modelling
the ith claim sizes of both portfolios and N the total number of such claims. If N = 0, then there are no claims,
so the largest claims in both portfolios are equal to 0. When N ≥ 1, then (XN :N , YN :N ) denotes the maximal claim
amounts in both portfolios. Commonly, claim sizes are assumed to be positive, however here we shall simply assume
that (Xi, Yi), i ≥ 1 are independent with common distribution function (df) G and N is independent of everything
else. Such a model is common for proportional reinsurance. In that case Yi = cXi with c being a positive constant.
Another instance is if Xi’s model claim sizes and Yi’s model the expenses related to the settlement of Xi’s, see [5] for
statistical treatments and further applications. The df of (XN :N , YN :N ) denoted by F ∗ is given by

x, y ≥ 0,
(1)
with LN the Laplace transform of N . Clearly, F ∗ is a mixture df given by
F ∗(x, y) = P{N = 0} + P{N ≥ 1} F (x, y),

F ∗(x, y) = LN (− ln G(x, y)),

x, y ≥ 0,

with Λ = N|N ≥ 1 and LΛ its Laplace transform.
Since both distributional and asymptotic properties of F ∗ can be easily derived from those of F , in this paper we shall
focus on F assuming throughout that Λ ≥ 1 is an integer-valued random variable.
When the df G is a product distribution, F above corresponds to the frailty model, see e.g., [5], whereas the special
case that Λ is a shifted geometric random variable is dealt with in [19]. We mention three tractable cases for Λ:
Model A: In [19], Λ is assumed to have a shifted Geometric distribution with parameter θ ∈ (0, 1) which leads to

Model B: Λ has a shifted Poisson distribution with parameter θ > 0, i.e., Λ = 1 + K with K being a Poisson random
variable with mean θ > 0, which implies

(4)
Model C: Λ has a truncated Poisson distribution with P{Λ = k} = e−θθk/(k!(1 − e−θ)), k ≥ 1 and thus

F (x, y) = G(x, y)e−θ[1−G(x,y)],

x, y ≥ 0.

F (x, y) =

e−θ
1 − e−θ [eθG(x,y) − 1],

x, y ≥ 0.

In this contribution we investigate ﬁrst some basic distributional properties of F for general Λ. With some motivation
from [19], which investigates Model A and its applications, in this paper, we shall discuss parameter estimation and
Monte Carlo simulations for parametric families of bivariate df’s induced by F . In particular, we apply our results to
actuarial modelling of concrete data sets from actuarial literature. Moreover we shall consider the implications of our
ﬁndings for a new real data set from a Swiss insurance company. In several cases Model B and Model C give both
satisfactory ﬁt to the data. For the case of Loss and ALAE data set we model further the stop loss and the excess of
loss reinsurance premium. As it will be shown in Section 5, interestingly the extremal properties of F are similar to
those of G.
Organisation of the rest of the paper. We discuss next some basic distributional properties of F . Section 3 is dedicated
to parameter estimation and Monte Carlo simulation with special focus on the cases covered by Model A-C above.
We present four applications to concrete insurance data set in Section 4 followed by an investigation of the coeﬃcient
of upper tail dependence and the max-domain of attractions of F . All the proofs are relegated to Section 6.
In
Appendix we display some details on copulas.

Let G denote the df of (X1, Y1) and write G1, G2 for its marginal df’s. Suppose that Gi’s are continuous and thus the
copula Q of G is unique. For Λ = N|N ≥ 1, we have that the marginal df’s of F are

2. Basic Properties of F

is the generalised inverse of Gi, i ≤ d. Consequently, since the continuity of Gi’s implies that of Fi’s, the

To this end, we brieﬂy discuss the correlation order and its implication for the dependence exhibited by F . Clearly,
for any x, y non-negative

F (x, y) ≤ G(x, y).

INSURANCE APPLICATIONS OF SOME NEW DEPENDENCE MODELS DERIVED FROM MULTIVARIATE COLLECTIVE MODELS 3

Consequently, in view of the correlation order, see e.g., [5] we have that Kendall’s tau τ (XΛ:Λ, YΛ:Λ), Spearman’s rank
correlation ρS(XΛ:Λ, YΛ:Λ) and the correlation coeﬃcient ρ(XΛ:Λ, YΛ:Λ) (when it is deﬁned) are bounded by the same
dependence measures calculated to (X1, Y1) with df G, respectively.
Moreover, if E{Λ} < ∞, then by applying Jensen’s inequality (recall Λ ≥ 1 almost surely) for any x, y non-negative

E{Λ} ln G(x,y) ≤ E(cid:110)

eΛ ln G(x,y)(cid:111) ≤ F (x, y),

Ga(x, y) ≤ G

E{Λ}(x, y) = e

(8)
with a the smallest integer larger than E{Λ}. Since Ga is a df, say of (S, T ), then again the correlation order implies
that τ (XΛ:Λ, YΛ:Λ) ≥ τ (S, T ), and similar bounds hold for Spearman’s rank correlation and the correlation coeﬃcient.
In the following we shall write also τ (C) and τ (Q) (if a = 1) instead of τ (XΛ:Λ, YΛ:Λ) and τ (S, T ), respectively. Simi-
larly, we denote ρS(C) and ρS(Q) instead of ρS(XΛ:Λ, YΛ:Λ) and ρS(S, T ), respectively.
In order to compare the dependence properties of both C and Q, we simulate random samples from both copulas and
compute the empirical dependence measures. In this respect, we generate a random sample from C in which Step
1-Step 4 in Subsection 3.2 are repeated 10(cid:48)000 times. Also, we simulate Λ from Model B and two cases of Q namely, a
Gumbel copula with parameter 10 and a Clayton copula with parameter 10. Table 1 describes the simulated empirical
Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho for the random samples generated from C and Q.

The table above shows that for the Gumbel copula case, the level of dependence of a bivariate risk governed by C is
lower or approximately equal to the one corresponding to Q when E{Λ} increases. For the case of Clayton copula,
the bigger E{Λ}, the weaker the dependence associated with C. In particular, for a copula Q with no upper tail
dependence, Clayton copula in our example, it can be seen that when E{Λ} increases, C tends to the independence
copula. However, when Q is an extreme value copula, Gumbel copula in our illustration, the rate of decrease in
the level of dependence with respect to E{Λ} is small. These empirical ﬁndings are due to the correlation order
demonstrated in (8). The results of the simulations can be better understood under the following setup:
Assume that Λ = Λn depends on n and write Cn instead of C. Suppose for simplicity that E{Λn} = n and G has
unit Fr´echet margins. Assume additionally the following convergence in probability

(9)

p→ 1, n → ∞.

Λn
n

The above conditions can be easily veriﬁed in concrete examples, in particular it holds if Λn = n almost surely.
In order to understand the dependence of Cn, we can calculate Kendall’s tau τ (Cn) as n → ∞. The simulation results
suggest that limn→∞ τ (Cn) = 0 if the copula Q of G has a coeﬃcient of upper tail dependence µQ = 0. Note that by
deﬁnition if µQ exists, then it is calculated by

(10)

µQ = 2 − lim
u↓0

u−1[1 − Q(1 − u, 1 − u)] ∈ [0, 1].

The following result establishes the convergence of both Kendall’s tau for Cn and Spearman’s rank correlation ρS(Cn)
to the corresponding measures of dependence with respect to an extreme value copula QA which approximates Q, i.e.,

for any (u1, u2) ∈ (0, 1]2 \ (1, 1), with A : [0, 1] → [1/2, 1] a convex function which satisﬁes

(13)

max(t, 1 − t) ≤ A(t) ≤ 1,

∀t ∈ [0, 1].

In the literature, see e.g., [9, 16, 3, 1, 2], A is referred to as the Pickands dependence function.

Proposition 2.1. If the copula Q satisﬁes (11) and further (9) holds, then

(14)

n→∞ τ (Cn) = τ (QA),
lim

lim
n→∞ ρS(Cn) = ρS(QA).

It is well-known that for Clayton copula (11) holds with QA being the independence copula, hence for this case by
(14) we have limn→∞ τ (Cn) = 0, which conﬁrms the ﬁndings in Table 1.
If QA is diﬀerent from the independence copula, and therefore A(t) < 1 for any t ∈ (0, 1), then we have (see e.g., [16])

(15)

τ (QA) =

For the Gumbel copula, the Pickands dependence function can be written as follows
t ∈ (0, 1), α ∈ (0, 1)

A(t) = (t1/α + (1 − t)1/α)α,

leading to a closed form for τ (QA) given by

τ (QA) = 1 − 1
α

.

In the case where α = 10, we obtain τ (QA) = 0.9 and ρS(QA) = 0.9855 which are in line with the simulation results
presented in Table 1.

3. Parameter Estimation & Monte Carlo Simulations

3.1. Parameter Estimation. This section focuses on the estimation of the parameters of the new copula C i.e., θ
of N and α of the copula Q. Hereafter, we denote Θ = (θ, α). There are three widely used methods for the estimation
of the copula parameters. The classical one is the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Another popular method
is the inference function for margins (IFM), which is a step-wise parametric method. First, the parameters of the
marginal df’s are estimated and then the copula parameter Θ are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function of
the copula with the marginal parameters replaced by their ﬁrst-stage estimators. Typically, the success of this method
depends upon ﬁnding appropriate parametric models for the marginals, see [14].
Finally, the pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML) method, introduced by Oakes [17] consists also of two steps. In the
ﬁrst step, the marginal df’s are estimated non-parametrically. The copula parameters are determined in the second
step by maximizing the pseudo log-likelihood function. Speciﬁcally, let X ∼ G1 and Y ∼ G2 where G1 and G2 are
the unknown marginals df’s of X and Y . For instance, if the data is not censored, a commonly used non-parametric
estimator of G1 and G2 is their sample empirical distributions which are speciﬁed as follows

Therefore, in order to estimate the parameter Θ, we maximize the following pseudo log-likelihood function

the pseudo log-likelihood function in (17) as (cid:99)G1(xi) or (cid:99)G2(yi) tends to 1, see [10].

where cΘ denotes the pdf of the copula. This rescaling is used to avoid diﬃculties arising from the unboundedness of

Kim et al. [14] show in a recent simulation study that the PML approach is better than the well-known IFM and MLE
methods when the marginal df’s are unknown, which is almost always the case in practice. Moreover, it is shown by
Genest et al. [10] that the resulting estimators from the PML approach are consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed.
Therefore, for our study, we shall use the PML method for the estimation of Θ which takes into account the empirical

counterparts of the marginal df’s to ﬁnd the parameter estimators.
As described in the Introduction, we consider three types of distributions for the random variable Λ:

• Model A: Λ follows a shifted Geometric distribution with parameter θ ∈ (0, 1).

The pdf of the Geometric copula is given by

(cid:32)

cΘ(u1, u2) = W (v1, v2)

(1 − (1 − θ)v1)2(1 − (1 − θ)v2)2

which yields the following pseudo log-likelihood function

l(Θ) =

(cid:17)

.

• Model B: Λ follows a Shifted Poisson distribution with parameter θ > 0.

The pdf of the shifted Poisson copula is of the form

(cid:32)

(18)

cΘ(u1, u2) = W (v1, v2)

(cid:33)

,

eθ(Qα(v1,v2)+1−v1−v2)

where vj = f−1(uj) with f (x) = x exp(θ(x − 1)) and

W (v1, v2) = (1 + θQα(v1, v2))

+ θ(2 + θQα(v1, v2))

The corresponding pseudo log-likelihood of the above copula is thus given by

(19)

l(Θ) =

θ(Qα(v1i, v2i) + 1 − v1i − v2i) − ln(1 + θv1i) − ln(1 + θv2i) + ln W (v1i, v2i)

In this section, we generate random samples from the proposed copula models C.

3.2. Monte Carlo Simulations. Based on the distributional properties of F derived in Section 2, we have the
following pseudo-algorithm for the simulation procedure which depends on the choice of Λ and Q:

• Step 1: Generate a value λ from Λ.
• Step 2: Generate λ random samples (U1,i, U2,i), i = 1, . . . , λ, from the original copula Q.
• Step 3: Calculate (M1, M2) as follows

• Step 4: Return (V1, V2), such that

Mj = max

i=1,...,λ

Uj,i,

j = 1, 2.

Vj = LΛ(− ln Mj),

j = 1, 2.

Simulation results are important for exploring the dependence of F . The simulation results in the table below complete
those presented already in Table 1.
In this regard, we generate random samples from the Joe copula with parameter
α = 10.

For the Joe copula, the Pickands dependence function can be written as follows

A(t) = 1 − ((ψ1(1 − t))−α + (ψ2t)−α)− 1

α

where ψ1, ψ2 ≤ 1 , t ∈ (0, 1) and α ∈ (0, 1).
By using (15) and for α = 10 and ψ1 = ψ2 = 1, we obtain τ (QA) = 0.9066 and ρS(QA) = 0.9874 which are in line
with the simulations results observed in Table 2 for τ (C) and ρS(C) as E{Λ} increases.

Another beneﬁt of our simulation algorithm is that we can assess the accuracy of our estimation method proposed
above. Therefore, we simulate random samples of size n from the copula C with diﬀerent distributions for Λ: Model
A, Model B and Model C and two types of copula for Q: the Gumbel copula and the Joe copula. Hereof, the
parameters θ of Λ and α of Q are estimated from the dataset described in Subsection 4.1 and are presented in Table

It can be seen from Table 4 and Table 5 that the estimated parameters from the simulated samples tend to the true
value of the parameters as the sample size n increases, thus indicating the accuracy of our proposed models.

4. Real insurance data applications

In this section, we illustrate the applications of the new copula families in the modelling of four real insurance data.
Speciﬁcally, we shall consider four copula families for Qα: Gumbel, Frank, Student and Joe and three mixture copulas
in which Λ with parameter θ follows one of the three distributions: Shifted Geometric, Shifted Poisson and Truncated
Poisson. The AIC criteria is used to assess the quality of each model ﬁt relative to each of the other models.

4.1. Loss ALAE from accident insurance. We shall model real insurance data from a large insurance company
operating in Switzerland. The dataset consists of 33’258 accident insurance losses and their corresponding allocated
loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) which includes mainly the cost of medical consultancy and legal fees. The observa-
tion period encompasses the claims occuring during the accident period 1986-20142.

Let Xi be the ith loss observed and Yi its corresponding ALAE.
Some statistics on the data are summarised in Table 6.

Table 6. Statistics for Loss ALAE data from accident line.

The scatterplot of (ALAE, loss) on a log scale is depicted in Figure 1. It can be seen that large values of loss is likely
to be associated with large values of ALAE. In addition, the empirical estimator of some dependence measures in
Table 7 suggests a positive dependence between Xi and Yi. For instance, the empirical estimator of the upper tail
dependence of 0.6869 indicates that there is a strong dependence in the tail of the distribution of Xi and Yi.

Table 8. Copula families parameters estimates.

It can be seen that the model which best ﬁts the data is the Student Geometric copula followed by the Joe Geometric
copula. We note in passing that the Student copula Qα has an additional parameter m which is the degree of freedom.

4.2. Loss ALAE from general liability insurance. This data set describes the general liability claims associated
with their ALAE retrieved from the Insurance Services Oﬃce available in the R package. In this respect, the sample
consists of 1’466 uncensored data points and 34 censored observations. We refer to [6] for more details on the description
of the data. Let Xi be the ith loss observed and Yi the ALAE associated to the settlement of Xi. Each loss is associated
with a maximum insured claim amount (policy limit) M . Thus, the loss variable Xi is censored when it exceeds the
policy limit M . We deﬁne the censored indicator of the loss variable by

Since the Joe Shifted Poisson copula has the the smallest AIC it represents the best model for describing the dependence
in the dataset followed by the Gumbel Shifted Poisson copula.

4.3. Loss ALAE from medical insurance. In this section, we will be working on the SOA Medical Group Insur-
ance datasets3 describing the medical claims observed over the years 1991 − 1992. The 171(cid:48)236 claims recorded in
both datasets are part of a larger database that includes the losses of 26 insurers over the period 1991-1992, see [11]
for more description on the data.
The two components which are of interest to us, are the hospital charges , corresponding to the loss variable Xi, and
the other charges corresponding to the ALAE variable Yi associated to the settlement of Xi.
The same dataset has been explored in [4] where claims occurring during the accident year 1991 have been considered.
For our study, we are going to work with claims occurring during the accident year 1992. The sample comprises of
75(cid:48)789 claims. There are 4 diﬀerent medical group plan types. Each policyholder belongs to one of these medical

In this respect, we consider the accident year 1992 records relating to Plan type 4, the loss variable Xi
exceeding 25(cid:48)000 in order to have a positive dependence between the loss and the ALAE, and strictly positive ALAE.

4.4. Danish ﬁre insurance data. The corresonding data set describes the Danish ﬁre insurance claims collected
from the Copenhagen Reinsurance Company for the period 1980-1990. It can be retrieved from the following website:
www.ma.hw.ac.uk/ ∼ mcneil/. This data set has ﬁrst been considered by Embrechts et al. [8] (Example 6.2.9) and
explored by Haug et al.
[13]. It consists of three components: loss to buildings, loss to contents and loss to proﬁt.
However, in this case, we model the dependence between the ﬁrst two components. The total number of observations
is of 1’501. We only consider the observations where both components are non-null. As indicated by the empirical
dependence measures in Table 13, the level of dependence between these two losses is low.

Table 14. Copula families parameters estimates.

It can be seen that the model that best ﬁts the data is the Joe copula followed by the Joe Truncated Poisson copula.
The Frank mixture copulas and Student mixture copulas are not a good ﬁt for the data as their AIC is higher by far
compared to the Gumbel and Joe mixture copulas families.

4.5. Reinsurance premiums. In this section, we examine the eﬀects of the dependence structure on reinsurance
premiums by using the proposed copula models. In practice, it is well known that insurance risks dependency has an
impact on reinsurance. For instance, Dhaene and Goovaerts [7] have shown that stop loss premium is greater under
the dependence assumption than under the independence case. In what follows, we consider the insurance claims data
described in Subsection 4.1 where we denote X the loss variable, Y the associated ALAE and K the number of claims
for the next accident year. In addition, two types of reinsurance treaties are analyzed namely:

• Excess-of-loss reinsurance, where the claims from Yi ’s are attributed proportionally to the insurer and the

reinsurer. For a given observation (Xi, Yi) the payment for the reinsurer is described as follows, see [4]

g(Xi, Yi, r) =

Xi − r +

Xi−r
Xi

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

if Xi (cid:54) r,
if Xi > r

(21)

(22)

leading to a reinsurance premium of the form

κ(r) = E{K} E{g(Xi, Yi, r)} ,

where r > 0 is the retention level.

• Stop loss reinsurance, where the premium is given by

(cid:40)(cid:16) K(cid:88)

π(d) = E

(Xi + Yi) − d

(cid:17)

(cid:41)

and d is a positive deductible.

i=1

In order to calculate the reinsurance premiums deﬁned above, Monte Carlo simulations have been implemented.
Hereof, we assume that K is Poisson distributed with a mean of 156.2, representing the expected number of claims
estimated by the insurance company. Additionally, we use the empirical distributions of Xi and Yi for the simulation
of the claims amount. Regarding the dependence model, the following copulas are considered: independent copula, Joe
copula, Geometric Joe Copula, Truncated Poisson Joe copula and the Shifted Poisson Joe copula where the parameters
are summarized in Table 8. The following steps summarize the implemented pseudo-algorithm:

• Step 2: Simulate (ui, vi), i = 1, . . . , K from the considered copula C.

Table 15. Reinsurance premiums with respect to copula models.

Table 13 shows that the reinsurance premiums ˆκ(r) and ˆπ(d) are lower under the independence hypothesis. Hence, the
portfolio is less risky when the loss variable Xi and the ALAE variable Yi are assumed to be independent. Furthermore,
when the retention limit r increases for the excess of loss treaty, the reinsurance premiums estimates ˆκ(r) under the
Joe mixture copula models tend to the estimated values under the independence assumption. Conversely, for the stop
loss treaty, the higher the deductible d the higher the deviation from the independence hypothesis.
Furthermore, by comparing the results for each copula model, it can be seen that the Joe copula generates the highest
reinsurance premiums. This result is expected given that the strongest dependence structure is obtained under the Joe
copula. On the other hand, the weakest dependence model for this data is observed under the Joe truncated Poisson
copula as the reisurance premiums ˆκ(r) and ˆπ(d) are the smallest for diﬀerent values of r and d.

5. Extremal Properties of F

This section is concerned with the extremal properties of the df F introduced in (1) in terms of G and Λ. The natural
question which we want to answer here is whether the extremal properties of G and F are the same. Therefore, we
shall assume that G is in the max-domain of attraction of some max-stable bivariate distribution H. Without loss of
generality we shall assume that H has unit Fr´echet marginal df’s. Hence, our assumption is that

(23)

n→∞ Gn(nx, ny) = H(x, y),
lim

x, y ∈ [0,∞).

The max-stability of H and the fact that its marginal df’s are unit Fr´echet imply

(24)

H t(tx, ty) = H(x, y),

∀x, y, t ∈ (0,∞)

see e.g., [9]. In case Λ is a shifted geometric random variable as in Model A, then the above assumptions imply for
any x, y non-negative (set q := 1 − θ)

(cid:104)

(cid:105)

n[1 − F (nx, ny)] = n

1 − θG(nx, ny)
1 − qG(nx, ny)

Hence

1 − qG(nx, ny)

→ − 1
θ

ln H(x, y), n → ∞.

n→∞ F n(nx, ny) = H 1/θ(x, y)
lim

or equivalently, using (24)

(26)

n→∞ F n(nx/θ, ny/θ) = H 1/θ(x/θ, y/θ) = H(x, y),
lim

x, y ∈ (0,∞)

and thus F is also in the same max-domain of attraction as G.
Our result below shows that the extremal properties of G are preserved for the general case when E{Λ} is ﬁnite. This
assumption is natural in collective models, since otherwise we cannot insure such portfolios.
Proposition 5.1. If E{Λ} is ﬁnite then µQ = µC. Moreover, if (23) holds, then
x, y ∈ (0,∞),

n→∞ F n(anx, any) = H(x, y),
lim

(27)
where an = E{Λ} n.

Remarks 5.2. i) It is well-known, see e.g., [9] that if G is in the max-domain of attraction of H, then the coeﬃcient
of upper tail dependence µQ of G with copula Q exists and

µQ = 2 + ln H(1, 1) = 2 − 2A(1/2).

By the above proposition, F is also in the max-domain of attraction of H, and thus

(28)

µC = 2 − 2A(1/2) = µQ ∈ [0, 1].

ii) Although F and G are in the same max-domain of attraction, the above proposition shows that the normalising
constant an = E{Λ} n for F is diﬀerent that for G (here an = n) if E{Λ} (cid:54)= 1.

We derive next the pdf cΘ in (18): In this case, Λ follows a shifted Poisson distribution. In view of (7), we need to
compute at ﬁrst the following components:

Λ(− ln Qα(v1, v2)) = −e−θ(1−Qα(v1,v2))Qα(v1, v2)(1 + θQα(v1, v2)),
L(cid:48)
Λ(− ln Qα(v1, v2)) = e−θ(1−Qα(v1,v2))Qα(v1, v2)(1 + 3θQα(v1, v2) + θ2Q2

Next, we show (20): Since Λ follows a truncated Poisson distribution, in light of (7), the joint density cΘ is expressed
in terms of (set ηθ = e−θ/(1 − e−θ))

hence the ﬁrst claim follows. Next, in view of (23) we have

n→∞ n[1 − G(nx, ny)] = − ln H(x, y),

x, y ∈ (0,∞),

hence as n → ∞

n[1 − G(nx, ny)] ∼ 1 − G(nx, ny)

∼ − ln H(x, y),

x, y ∈ (0,∞).

Let an, n ≥ 1 be non-negative constants such that limn→∞ an = ∞. By the above and (31)

n[1 − F (anx, any)] = n[1 − LΛ(− ln G(anx, any))] ∼ E{Λ} n(− ln G(anx, any))

as n → ∞. Setting now an = E{Λ} n we have thus as n → ∞
