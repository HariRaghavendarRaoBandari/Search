ABSTRACT
The formation and evolution of galaxies with low neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) masses,
MHI<108h−2M(cid:12), are aﬀected by host dark matter halo mass and photoionisation feed-
back from the UV background after the end of reionization. We study how the physical
processes governing the formation of galaxies with low HI mass are imprinted on the
distribution of neutral hydrogen in the Universe using the hierarchical galaxy forma-
tion model, GALFORM. We calculate the eﬀect on the correlation function of changing
the HI mass detection threshold at redshifts 0 (cid:54) z (cid:54) 0.5. We parameterize the clus-
tering as ξ(r) = (r/r0)−γ and we ﬁnd that including galaxies with MHI<108h−2M(cid:12)
increases the clustering amplitude r0 and slope γ compared to samples of higher HI
masses. This is due to these galaxies with low HI masses typically being hosted by
haloes with masses greater than 1012h−1M(cid:12). This is in contrast to optically selected
galaxy surveys for which the inclusion of faint, blue galaxies lowers the clustering am-
plitude. We show the HI mass function for diﬀerent host dark matter halo masses and
galaxy types (central or satellite) to interpret the values of r0 and γ of the clustering
of HI-selected galaxies. We also predict the contribution of low HI mass galaxies to the
21cm intensity mapping signal. We calculate that a dark matter halo mass resolution
better than ∼1010h−1M(cid:12) at redshifts higher than 0.5 is required in order to predict
21cm brightness temperature ﬂuctuations that are well converged.

Key words: galaxies: formation – evolution – large-scale structure of the Universe

1 INTRODUCTION

In hierarchical structure formation theory, the distribution
of galaxies is related to the distribution of dark matter in
the Universe. Studies of the spatial distribution of galaxies
as a function of colour, luminosity, type and stellar mass
therefore give important information about where galaxies
form and which halos host them (Brown et al. 2000; Norberg
et al. 2002; Madgwick et al. 2003; Loh et al. 2010; Zehavi
et al. 2011; Campbell et al. 2015).

Neutral hydrogen is a key ingredient of galaxy forma-
tion as it traces the processes of gas accretion, outﬂow from
galaxies and star formation. It is therefore important to un-
derstand the relation between neutral hydrogen and dark
matter haloes. However, understanding galaxy formation
and evolution using neutral hydrogen observations is ham-

pered by the weakness of the signal compared to optical ob-
servations. The last decade has seen improvements in both
the volume and ﬂux limit of surveys that probe the HI con-
tent of galaxies from the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS,
Zwaan et al. 2005), the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (AL-
FALFA, Martin et al. 2010) and the Arecibo Ultra-Deep
Survey (AUDS, Hoppmann et al. 2015). Studies of the dis-
tribution of HI-selected galaxies in the local Universe have
shown that these galaxies are an unbiased (weakly clustered)
galaxy population (Meyer et al. 2007; Martin et al. 2012; Pa-
pastergis et al. 2013).

There have been some studies of the large scale struc-
ture of galaxies based on their neutral hydrogen using
the halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism (Wyithe
et al. 2009) and hierarchical galaxy formation models (Kim
et al. 2011, 2013). These works have focused on high HI
mass galaxies (MHI> 109.25h−2M(cid:12)), which are mainly cen-
tral galaxies located in dark matter haloes of masses ∼

1012h−1M(cid:12). In contrast, red massive galaxies have either
consumed most of their gas (neutral hydrogen) in forming
stars or have expelled it by feedback processes (Power et al.
2010; Kim et al. 2011; Lagos et al. 2011), as shown by their
very low neutral gas content (Young et al. 2011; Serra et al.
2012; Boselli et al. 2014). HI deﬁcient galaxies also result
from ram pressure stripping by hot gaseous atmospheres
around satellite galaxies in groups and clusters, and tidal
interactions between galaxies in high density environments
(McCarthy et al. 2008; Font et al. 2008; Cortese et al. 2012;
Boselli et al. 2014; Bah´e & McCarthy 2015). These processes
all aﬀect the distribution of satellite galaxies in groups and
clusters.

Kim et al. (2015) demonstrated the importance of pho-
toionisation feedback for galaxy formation and evolution in
low mass dark matter haloes, and the low-mass end of the
HI mass function in the local Universe (see also Lagos et al.
2011; Kim et al. 2013). Kim et al. (2015) showed that the
contribution of low mass dark matter haloes to the low-mass
end of the HI mass function changes dramatically when dif-
ferent photoionisation feedback modelling schemes are ap-
plied. Therefore, it is natural to expect these models to aﬀect
the predicted clustering of low HI mass galaxies.

The number of individual galaxies detected in HI will
greatly increase through ongoing and upcoming large vol-
ume HI-selected galaxy surveys using the SKA (Square Kilo-
motre Array; e.g. Baugh et al. 2004; Power et al. 2010;
Kim et al. 2011) and its pathﬁnders, such as ASKAP
(Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathﬁnder; cf. John-
ston et al. 2008), and MeerKAT (Meer Karoo Array Tele-
scope; cf. Jonas 2007) in the southern hemisphere, FAST
(Fivehundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope)1, and
APERTIF (APERture Tile In Focus)2 in the northern hemi-
sphere. In addition, the BINGO (the BAO in Neutral Gas
Observations; Battye et al. 2012), CHIME (the Canadian
Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment; Bandura et al.
2014), and SKA are expected to detect the distribution of
neutral hydrogen at 0.5<z<3 in the Universe using the 21cm
intensity mapping technique which does not require individ-
ual HI-selected galaxies to be resolved (Wyithe & Loeb 2007;
Wolz et al. 2014; Santos et al. 2015). Here, we show the im-
portance of the contribution of galaxies with low HI masses
to the large scale distribution of neutral hydrogen in the
Universe.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In §2, we pro-
vide a brief overview of the hierarchical galaxy formation
models used. In §3 we show the clustering of HI selected
galaxies from the models and the comparison between the
models and observations. In §4 we extend predictions of HI
galaxy clustering to higher redshifts and show predictions
for 21cm brightness ﬂuctuations at diﬀerent redshifts in §5.
We ﬁnish with a summary of our results in §6.

2 THE GALAXY FORMATION MODEL

We use the semi-analytical galaxy formation model GAL-
FORM (cf. Cole et al. 2000; Baugh 2006; Lacey et al. 2015)

1 details at http://fast.bao.ac.cn/en/
2 details at www.astron.nl/jozsa/wnshs

described in Lagos et al. (2012) and Kim et al. (2015) to
predict the properties of galaxies which form and evolve in
the ΛCDM cosmology. GALFORM models the key phys-
ical processes involved in galaxy formation, including the
gravitationally driven assembly of dark matter halos, ra-
diative cooling of gas and its collapse to form centrifugally
supported discs, star formation, feedback from supernovae
(SNe) and active galactic nuclei (AGN), and photoionisa-
tion. We implement GALFORM in halo merger trees ex-
tracted from the Millennium-II cosmological N-body simu-
lation3 which has a 100h−1Mpc box size (Boylan-Kolchin
et al. 2009); see Jiang et al. (2014) for a description of the
construction of the merger trees. The particle mass of the
simulation is 6.89×106h−1M(cid:12) and we retain haloes down to
20 particles.

Lagos et al. (2011) extended GALFORM by modelling
the splitting of cold gas in the interstellar medium (ISM)
into its HI and H2 components and by explicitly linking star
formation to the amount of H2 present in a galaxy. Lagos
et al. (2011) compared empirically and theoretically derived
star formation laws (cf. Blitz & Rosolowsky 2006; Krumholz
et al. 2009) with a variety of observations and found that the
empirical law of Blitz & Rosolowsky (2006) (see also Leroy
et al. 2008) is favoured by these data.

Another important physical process aﬀecting HI masses
in galaxies is reionization. The standard reionizaton model
in GALFORM suppresses cooling in galaxies with host halo
circular velocity Vcirc below a threshold Vcut below redshift
zcut (see Benson et al. 2002). Lagos et al. (2011) adopted
Vcut=30 km/s and zcut=10. Lagos et al. (2012) changed two
parameters corresponding to the star formation timescale
during starbursts, τmin=100 Myr and fdyn=50 when the
star formation timescale is calculated as τSF =min(fdyn ×
τdyn,bulge, τmin), to better match the observed rest-frame
UV luminosity function over the redshift range z=3-6 (here-
after Lagos2012). Here τdyn,bulge is the dynamical timescale
of the bulge.

Kim et al. (2015) introduced a new model for photoion-
isation feedback in order to correctly describe the low-mass
end of the HI mass function (106h−2M(cid:12)<MHI<108h−2M(cid:12))
estimated from the ALFALFA survey at z=0 (hereafter
Kim2015). In contrast to the Lagos2012, Kim et al. (2015)
adopted the redshift-dependent photoionisation feedback
model (Dijkstra et al. 2004) described in Sobacchi &
Mesinger (2013). Kim et al. (2015) use a redshift dependent
Vcut given by:

(cid:34)

1 −

(cid:18) 1 + z

1 + zIN

(cid:19)2(cid:35)2.5/3

,

(1)

Vcut(z)[km/s] = Vcut0(1 + z)αv

where zIN is the redshift of UV background exposure, Vcut0
is the circular velocity of dark matter halos at z=0 be-
low which photoionisation feedback suppresses gas cooling
and αv parameterises the redshift dependence of the veloc-
ity cut. We use the best ﬁtting set of parameters in Kim

3 The cosmological parameters adopted for the Millennium Sim-
ulations are a total matter density ΩM = 0.25, baryon density
Ωb = 0.045, dark energy density ΩΛ = 0.75, Hubble parame-
ter H0 = 73 kms−1 Mpc−1, the primordial scalar spectral index
ns = 1 and the ﬂuctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.9.

et al. (2015), (Vcut0, αv)=(50 km/s,-0.82) at zIN=10, which
was found by comparing the predicted HI mass function
to the measurements by the ALFALFA survey. The pre-
dicted HI mass function using this set of parameters shows
an improved match with observations compared to the La-
gos2012 model. Note that Sobacchi & Mesinger (2013) sug-
gested αv=-0.2 and a critical halo mass that is ten times
larger that the one we used for a UV background intensity
of 1×1021erg/s/Hz/cm2/sr (for more details see Kim et al.
2015).

3 LARGE SCALE DISTRIBUTION OF

NEUTRAL HYDROGEN IN THE LOCAL
UNIVERSE

We show clustering predictions for galaxies selected using
diﬀerent HI mass thresholds in § 3.1. To compare the spa-
tial distributions of galaxies selected by diﬀerent HI mass
criteria, we investigate the contributions of diﬀerent host
dark matter halo masses and types of galaxies to the HI
mass function in § 3.2.

We quantify the large scale distribution of galaxies using
the two point correlation function. This is written in terms of
the excess probability, compared to a random distribution,
of ﬁnding another galaxy at a separation r,

dP = ¯n2[1 + ξ(r)]δV1δV2,

(2)

where ¯n is the mean number density of the galaxy sample
and δV1, δV2 are volume elements. In the case of an HI-
selected galaxy catalogue produced from a galaxy formation
model combined with a periodic N-body simulation, we can
measure the correlation function using

1 + ξ(r) = DHIDHI/(¯n2

HIV dV ),

(3)

where DHIDHI is the number of pairs of HI-selected galaxies
with separations in the range r to r+δr, ¯nHI is mean num-
ber density of HI-selected galaxies, V is the volume of the
simulation, and dV is the diﬀerential volume corresponding
to r to r+δr.

The correlation function can be described by a power

law using two parameters as

ξ(r) = (r/r0)

−γ,

(4)

where r0 indicates the correlation length at which ξ(r0)=1,
corresponding to twice the probability relative to random
distribution. The value of r0 is related to the typical host
dark matter halo mass of the selected galaxies, and γ is
related to the number of satellite galaxies in a host dark
matter halo.

3.1 HI mass dependent clustering

The ALFALFA survey measures the HI mass function down
to HI masses of ∼106h−2M(cid:12). This low mass limit pro-
vides an important test for galaxy formation models. The
Kim2015 model is able to reproduce the observed HI mass
function from ALFALFA by adopting a redshift-dependent
photoionisation feedback model (see §2 and also Fig. 2).

In Fig. 1, we show clustering predictions for galax-
ies selected using diﬀerent HI mass thresholds. The clus-
tering predictions for the two highest HI mass thresholds

for diﬀerent HI mass thresholds using the Kim2015 model, as
labelled.

(MHI>108h−2M(cid:12) and MHI>109h−2M(cid:12)) are very similar,
both in shape (γ) and the correlation length (r0). However,
the two lowest HI mass thresholds (MHI>106h−2M(cid:12) and
MHI>107h−2M(cid:12)) show larger correlation lengths (larger r0)
and also steeper correlation functions (larger γ) than the two
high HI mass samples (see values of r0 and γ in Table 1 and
Fig. 6 at z=0). Overall, the trend of clustering as a func-
tion of HI mass threshold shows that galaxies become more
clustered as the HI mass threshold decreases.

3.2 Understanding the HI mass-dependent

clustering in the Kim2015 model

The clustering of galaxy samples can be broken down into
the contribution of the host dark matter haloes (Berlind
& Weinberg 2002; Kravtsov et al. 2004; Kim et al. 2011,
2012). We therefore investigate the contributions to the HI
mass function from diﬀerent galaxies and diﬀerent mass host
dark matter haloes.

The top-left panel of Fig. 2 shows the contribution of
diﬀerent types of HI-selected galaxies (black solid line for all
galaxies, blue dotted line for central galaxies, and red dashed
line for satellite galaxies) to the HI mass function. Central
galaxies are the dominant (over 90%) type of galaxy when we
focus on galaxies with HI masses MHI>108.5h−2M(cid:12). How-
ever, the contributions of central galaxies and satellite galax-
ies to the HI mass function are similar for MHI<108h−2M(cid:12).
The top-right panel of Fig. 2 shows the HI mass func-
tions for galaxies in diﬀerent bins of host dark matter halo
mass. Most galaxies with HI masses >107.5h−2M(cid:12) reside in
dark matter haloes with masses between 1010h−1M(cid:12) and
1012h−1M(cid:12). Dark matter haloes with mass <1010h−1M(cid:12)
mainly contribute to the low-mass end of the HI mass
function, MHI<107h−2M(cid:12), while making a negligible con-
tribution to the HI mass function at HI masses higher
than 108h−2M(cid:12). The most massive dark matter haloes

Figure 2. The predicted HI mass function in the Kim2015 model. The top-left panel shows the contribution of central and satellite
galaxies to the HIMF. The top-right panel shows the contribution of diﬀerent masses of dark matter haloes. The bottom panels show the
contribution of diﬀerent masses of dark matter haloes for central galaxies (left panel) and satellite galaxies (right panel). The symbols
correspond to observational estimations from the local Universe from HIPASS (open triangles; cf. Zwaan et al. 2005) and ALFALFA
(ﬁlled squares; cf. Martin et al. 2010).

(>1014h−1M(cid:12)) contribute less than 10% to the abundance
of galaxies at all HI masses.

We show dark matter halo contributions divided into
central (bottom-left panel of Fig. 2) and satellite galax-
ies (bottom-right panel of Fig. 2). For central galax-
ies, the dominant contribution to the HI mass function
at MHI>107.5h−2M(cid:12) is from dark matter haloes with
masses 1010h−1M(cid:12)<Mhalo<1012h−1M(cid:12). Central galaxies
which reside in higher mass host dark matter haloes
(1012h−1M(cid:12)<Mhalo<1014h−1M(cid:12) and >1014h−1M(cid:12)) repre-
sent a very small fraction of HI-selected galaxies. Dark mat-
ter haloes with masses less than 1010h−1M(cid:12) mainly host
central galaxies with MHI<107h−2M(cid:12).

We ﬁnd that the number of HI-selected galaxies that
are satellites increases with decreasing HI mass for all host
dark matter halo mass. Furthermore, at MHI<107h−2M(cid:12),
HI satellite galaxies dominate the number density. These
satellite galaxies tend to lie in dark matter haloes of mass
Mhalo>1012h−M(cid:12).

In Fig. 1, we found that the correlation length r0 be-
comes larger as the HI mass threshold decreases for the se-
lected galaxy samples. This is due to the larger contributions
of high mass host dark matter haloes (Mhalo>1012h−1M(cid:12))
to the HI mass function (see top-right panel of Fig. 2) at
MHI<108h−2M(cid:12). In addition, the contribution of satellite
galaxies residing in the highest mass host dark matter haloes

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–12

The spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen as traced by low HI mass galaxies

(Mhalo>1014h−1M(cid:12)) at MHI<108h−2M(cid:12) leads to a boost in
the clustering amplitude at small separations (see Fig. 1).
We also ﬁnd that the slope of the correlation function de-
creases with increasing HI mass due to the reduced contri-
bution of satellite galaxies.

We show the distribution of host dark matter halo mass
as a function of HI mass in galaxies in the left panel of Fig. 3.
The symbols show the median dark matter halo mass as a
function of HI mass for central galaxies (blue squares), satel-
lite galaxies (red triangles) and all galaxies (black circles).
The bars show the 10th-90th percentile range of the distribu-
tion of host dark matter halo masses. The host dark matter
halo mass of central galaxies increases as the HI mass in-
creases. In contrast, the median host dark matter halo mass
for satellite HI-selected galaxies is constant over the entire
range of HI masses (median value ∼1013h−1M(cid:12)).

We also show in the right panel of Fig. 3 the total HI
mass contained in all galaxies within a halo. The symbols
show the median total HI mass as a function of dark mat-
ter halo mass, for central galaxies (open blue squares), all
satellite galaxies (open red triangles) and all galaxies (open
black circles) in a halo. The bars show the 10th-90th per-
centile range of the distribution of total HI masses. The to-
tal HI mass in a halo is contributed mainly by the central
galaxy for dark matter haloes less massive than 1012h−1M(cid:12)
and satellite galaxies for dark matter haloes more massive
than 1012h−1M(cid:12). Note that these measurements have not
been done with observations yet and thus these are model
predictions that need to be veriﬁed by observations. In this
model there is very little HI gas in the central galaxy haloes
more massive than this due to the shut down of the cooling
ﬂow by AGN heating (Kim et al. 2011). The total HI mass
of satellites (adding all HI masses of satellites together in
a halo) increases as the halo mass increases. This predicted
relation between total HI mass in a dark matter halo and
dark matter halo mass would be the physically motivated in-
put to make HI intensity mapping mock observations based
on dark haloes using large volume dark matter only simula-
tions.

3.3 Imprinted photoionisation feedback on HI

clustering

In the previous subsection we presented predictions for HI
galaxy clustering and the mass function. By comparing these
predictions with the observed HI mass function and clus-
tering of HI-selected galaxies from HIPASS (Meyer et al.
2007) and ALFALFA (Martin et al. 2012) (see Kim et al.
2011, 2013, 2015) we can test the galaxy formation model.
Martin et al. (2012) showed that HI-selected galaxies dis-
play an anisotropic clustering pattern, and are less clustered
than dark matter on scales < 5Mpc. Furthermore, Papaster-
gis et al. (2013) found no evidence for HI mass-dependent
clustering over the HI mass range between 108.5M(cid:12) and
1010.5M(cid:12). Meyer et al. (2007) used 4315 sources from the
HIPASS survey to measure the clustering of HI-selected
galaxies. Martin et al. (2012) used a sample of ∼10150 galax-
ies (MHI>106.2h−2M(cid:12)) and Papastergis et al. (2013) used a
sample of ∼6000 galaxies detected by the ALFALFA 21cm
survey (MHI>107.5h−2M(cid:12)), to measure the clustering prop-
erties of HI-selected galaxies. Whilst these surveys represent
a tremendous step forwards in terms of blind surveys of the

c(cid:13) 2016 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1–12

HI content of galaxies, it is important to bear in mind when
considering clustering measurements made from them that
they contain orders of magnitudes fewer galaxies and sam-
ple smaller volumes than local optical surveys, such as the
two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (Colless, M. et al.
2001), or Sloan Digital Sky Survey (York & et al. 2000).

The left panel of Fig. 4 shows the HI mass functions pre-
dicted by the Lagos2012 (red dotted line) and the Kim2015
(black solid line) models. The Kim2015 model applied a new
scheme for photoionisation feedback in order to improve the
agreement of the predicted low-mass end of the HI mass
function with the estimation from the ALFALFA survey at
z=0.

The right panel of Fig. 4 shows the correlation func-
tions for diﬀerent HI mass thresholds in the Kim2015 model,
compared with observations from Meyer et al. (2007) using
the best ﬁtting r0 and γ values for galaxies with HI masses
>109.25h−2M(cid:12). The right-sub panel shows the ratio between
the predictions of the Lagos2012 and the Kim2015 models,
for the same HI mass thresholds used in the second top-sub
panel. These models diﬀer in their treatment of photoioni-
sation feedback as described in §2. The right panel of Fig. 4
shows that HI-selected galaxies down to MHI>107h−2M(cid:12)
could constrain the properties of photoionisation feedback
(which is also imprinted on the HI mass function, Kim et al.
2015), and the contribution of satellite galaxies to the distri-
bution of HI-selected galaxies from HI clustering measure-
ments through the γ value of the correlation function.
Fig. 4 illustrates that observational HI clustering mea-
surements which contain HI galaxies with MHI<108h−2M(cid:12)
are necessary to constrain the modelling of galaxy forma-
tion, particularly how photoionisation aﬀects small galaxies
(Kim et al. 2015), and the contribution of satellite galaxies
to the distribution of HI galaxies.

4 DISTRIBUTION OF NEUTRAL HYDROGEN

AT HIGH REDSHIFTS

We now investigate the predicted clustering of HI selected
galaxies at high redshift in ongoing and future HI galaxy
surveys.

Power et al. (2010) showed that the HI mass function
undergoes little evolution from z=1 to z=0 (see also, Kim
et al. 2011; Lagos et al. 2011). This is due to a competi-
tion between gas cooling, the transition from HI to H2 and
star formation, together with mass ejection by winds. This
is a generic feature predicted by galaxy formation models for
high HI mass galaxies (see Power et al. 2010). However, this
picture could break down for HI-poor galaxies, which reside
in low mass dark matter haloes. These haloes are more sensi-
tive to photoionization feedback, which hampers gas cooling.
Here, we investigate the evolution of the HI mass function.
The left panel of Fig. 5 shows the predicted HI mass func-
tions at z=0, 0.2, and 0.5 (corresponding to maximum red-
shifts expected to be observed by the WALLABY4(z∼0.2),

function of the HI mass of galaxies, for central galaxies (blue squares), satellite galaxies (red triangles) and all galaxies (black circles).
The bars show the 10th-90th percentile ranges of the distributions of dark matter halo masses. The right panel shows the total HI mass
contained in a halo. The symbols show the median total HI mass as a function of dark matter halo mass, for central galaxies (open blue
squares), all satellite galaxies (open red triangles) and all galaxies (open black circles) in a halo. The bars show the 10th-90th percentile
ranges of the distributions of total HI masses. In this ﬁgure we include all galaxies which have HI mass larger than 104h−1M(cid:12).

Figure 4. The left panel shows the HI mass function at z=0 predicted by the Lagos2012 (red dotted line) and the Kim2015 (black solid
line) models. The right panel shows the correlation function of diﬀerent HI mass threshold samples at z=0 for the Kim2015 model. The
right bottom-sub panel shows the ratio between the predictions of the Lagos2012 model and the Kim2015 models for the same HI mass
thresholds samples labelled in the right top-sub panel. The magenta ﬁlled squares connected by the solid line in the right top-sub panel
show the measurement of Meyer et al. (2007) using their best ﬁt r0 and γ values for galaxies with HI masses >109.25h−2M(cid:12).

correlation length (r0) and slope (γ) increase as redshift de-
creases from z=0.5 to z=0. This implies that galaxies at
low redshift are more clustered than higher redshift galaxies
selected above the same HI mass threshold, which is con-
sistent with the hierarchical growth of structures. For com-
parison, the symbols with errorbars show the best ﬁt value
of r0 (the left panel of Fig. 6) and γ (the right panel of
Fig. 6) estimated from observations in the local Universe
of HI-selected for galaxies with MHI>109.25h−2M(cid:12) (Meyer
et al. 2007), MHI>106.2h−2M(cid:12) (Martin et al. 2012), and
MHI> 108, 108.5, and 109h−2M(cid:12) (Papastergis et al. 2013).
Note that the predictions are in reasonable agreement with
the observations for MHI >108h−2M(cid:12). However, the model
does not reproduce the clustering estimated by Martin et al.
(2012) for samples with MHI >106.2h−2M(cid:12). The values of
r0 do not change signiﬁcantly if the value of γ is held ﬁxed
at the value found in the observational study. On the other
hand, we remind the reader that the observational cluster-
ing measurements come from small volumes, which can be
aﬀected by large cosmic variance. Although Martin et al.
(2012) attempted to correct for the selection function of the
sample, to account for the fact that low HI mass galaxies are
seen over a much smaller volume than high HI mass galaxies,
the clearest approach for measuring galaxy clustering is to
use volume limited samples. However, this is not yet feasible
with the current HI surveys as it requires many galaxies to
be omitted from the analysis (see for example the volume
limited samples used in an optical galaxy survey by Norberg
et al. 2001).

these galaxies are between ∼ 30 km/s and ∼ 50 km/s in
the Kim2015 model. These velocities correspond to galaxies
which become aﬀected by photoionization feedback between
z=0.5 and z=0.

The right panel of Fig. 5 shows the predicted correla-
tion functions at z=0, 0.2 and 0.5 for two diﬀerent HI mass
thresholds (MHI >106h−2M(cid:12) and MHI >108h−2M(cid:12)). The
correlation functions at higher redshift have lower correla-
tion length (r0) and slope (γ) than at lower redshift for
the same HI mass thresholds (see Table 1). The parameters
r0 and γ were derived by ﬁtting the predicted correlation
functions (Eq. 4) over separations between 1 and 10h−1Mpc
(This range was chosen based on the approach in Meyer et al.
(2007) and Martin et al. (2012) who used the projected sep-
aration <10h−1Mpc and Papastergis et al. (2013) used the
projected separation between 0.5h−1Mpc and 10h−1Mpc)
and considering γ values between 0 to 5.

In the left panel of Fig. 6, we show variations on the
predicted correlation length (r0) at diﬀerent redshifts and
HI mass thresholds. In agreement with the z=0 predictions,
we ﬁnd that lower HI mass threshold samples show a larger
correlation length than higher HI mass threshold samples at
all redshifts in contrast to optically selected galaxy samples
(c.f, red galaxy samples show an increasing r0 at faint lumi-
nosities). This is because the contribution of galaxies hosted
by high mass dark matter haloes increases with decreasing
HI mass threshold (see Fig 2).

In the right panel of Fig. 6, we show the predicted corre-
lation function slope (γ) for diﬀerent redshifts and HI mass
thresholds. γ displays similar trends with redshift and HI
mass threshold to r0 (left panel of Fig. 6). Samples selected
using lower HI mass thresholds show steeper correlation
functions compared to samples using higher HI mass thresh-
olds due to the contribution of satellite galaxies hosted by
dark matter haloes of Mhalo>1014h−1M(cid:12). In addition, the

5 EFFECT OF GALAXIES WITH LOW HI

MASSES ON THE SIGNAL FOR 21CM
INTENSITY MAPPING

As noted above, clustering studies of low HI mass-selected
galaxies will be restricted to z ∼ 0.5, even within the deep-
est HI surveys planned (e.g., DINGO). An alternative way
to study the clustering of galaxies down to low HI masses
and at high redshifts (0.5<z<3) is through 21cm intensity
mapping, which measures the ﬂuctuation in the 21cm sig-
nal from unresolved HI-selected galaxies (Wyithe & Loeb
2007). This is a new strategy to economically map much
larger volumes of the Universe, by measuring the collective
21cm emission from all galaxies within some volume set by
the angular resolution of the telescope and the frequency
interval samples.

We predict the 21cm intensity mapping signal using the
Kim2015 model. First, we divide the volume of the simula-
tion into 2563 cells (0.39Mpc/h cell size corresponds to ∼ 1
arcmin at z=1). We then sum the mass of all HI in galaxies
in each cell, and measure the resulting ﬂuctuations of 21cm
intensity.

The power spectrum of 21cm brightness ﬂuctuations is

deﬁned in Wyithe & Brown (2010) as

ture contrast between the mean intergalactic medium (IGM)
and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at redshift
z. The term <b(z)> is the HI mass-weighted halo bias,
PDM(k, z) is the power spectrum of the dark matter, and
xHI(z) is the fraction of neutral atomic hydrogen xHI(z) =
ΩHI(z)/0.76/Ωb where ΩHI(z) is the neutral atomic hydro-
gen density and Ωb the baryon density of the Universe.
Equivalently, we can predict the intensity mapping signal us-
ing the power spectrum of the HI mass of galaxies, PHI(k, z),

Fig. 7 shows the predicted 21cm brightness temperature
power spectrum predicted by the Kim2015 model for four
diﬀerent HI mass thresholds. The amplitude of the 21cm
brightness temperature power spectrum decreases as the
HI mass threshold increases, while the slope of the 21cm
power spectrum increases with increasing HI mass thresh-
old. We ﬁnd that the 21cm intensity mapping power spec-
trum converges for MHI>107h−2M(cid:12). We also show the ra-

P21cm,G6 is the 21cm power spectrum using all galaxies with

tra of larger mass threshold and P21cm,G6.

ference between a 21cm power spectrum using the galaxies
above a given HI mass threshold and the 21cm power spec-
trum using all galaxies with MHI(cid:62)106h−2M(cid:12) (P21cm,G6).
Note that we choose the P21cm,G6 to compare with other HI
mass thresholds because MHI∼106h−2M(cid:12) is the minimum
HI mass which can be trusted in the Kim2015 model based
on the Millennium-II simulation (which has a minimum halo
mass of few times 108h−1M(cid:12)).

We extend the prediction of the 21cm brightness tem-
perature ﬂuctuation to higher redshifts in Fig. 8. There are
two main factors driving the evolution of the 21cm bright-
ness temperature power spectrum. One is ΩHI(z), which is
the neutral hydrogen density, and the other is the bias gov-
erned by the mass of dark matter haloes hosting the HI-
selected galaxies (r0 and γ). The predicted value of ΩHI(z)
at z=1 is larger than at z=0.5 and z=0 (see Fig 9 in Kim
et al. 2015). However, the clustering of dark matter haloes
hosting the HI-selected galaxies at z=0 is stronger, partic-
ularly at small separations (compare Fig. 1 to Fig. 5 and
see Fig. 6). Thus, these competing drivers lead to diﬀer-
ent amplitudes and slopes for the predicted 21cm brightness
temperature power spectra at diﬀerent redshifts.

We now focus on the contribution of unresolved galax-
ies. Power et al. (2010) showed that in the Millennium sim-
ulation, galaxies with MHI<108h−2M(cid:12) cannot be properly
resolved (and so the completeness of the simulation drops
below this HI mass). We explore the eﬀect of unresolved
galaxies on the 21cm signals from intensity mapping (Fig. 9).
We ﬁrst ignore HI masses in galaxies that reside in the dark
matter haloes less massive than 1.72× 1010h−1M(cid:12) in the
Millennium-II simulation (corresponding to the dark matter
halo mass resolution of the larger Millennium simulation).

The diﬀerence in 21cm brightness temperature ﬂuctuations
increases at higher redshifts (see long dashed lines in sub-
panels of Fig. 9). This shows that low HI mass galaxies can-
not be ignored if we aim to provide accurate predictions
of the 21cm brightness temperature ﬂuctuations at higher
redshifts.

The GBT (Green Bank telescope) has pioneered the de-
tection of the large scale structure using the technique of 21
cm intensity mapping (Chang et al. 2010; Masui et al. 2013;
Switzer et al. 2013). In the near future, more sensitive ex-
periments will improve upon this work, including BINGO,
CHIME, and the SKA which will carry out 21cm intensity
mapping measurements at diﬀerent redshifts. We show the
predicted sensitivity of SKA in the second and third panels
of Fig. 9 at k ∼ 0.1hMpc−1 based on calculations of San-
tos et al. (2015). This predicted sensitivity of the SKA is
one of main drivers of the eﬀort behind the modelling of
the HI content of galaxies down to low HI mass galaxies
(MHI<107h−2M(cid:12)) using a high enough resolution simula-
tion to properly include these low HI mass galaxies.

6 SUMMARY

We have predicted the clustering of HI galaxy samples as a
function of HI mass threshold. The clustering of HI-selected
galaxies is very similar for HI-selected galaxies with masses
greater than 108h−2M(cid:12). This similarity can be explained in
terms of the contribution of host dark matter haloes to the
HI mass function. We estimate power-law ﬁts for the pre-
dicted correlation functions and derive the correlation length
r0 and slope γ, as a function of redshift. We ﬁnd that r0 and
γ increase as the HI mass threshold decreases, which is the
contrary to the expectations for optically selected galaxy
samples. In addition, the predictions of clustering for dif-
ferent redshifts show that the correlation length and slope
increase as redshift decreases from z=0.5 to z=0.
We calculate the contribution of low HI mass galaxies
to 21cm intensity mapping (z=0, ∼0.5, and ∼1). We ﬁnd
that it is important to model the HI mass function down to
low HI masses of ∼ 107h−2M(cid:12) in order to correctly predict
shape and amplitude of forthcoming observations of power
spectra of 21cm intensity ﬂuctuations. We also show that the
importance of low HI mass galaxies to the 21cm brightness
ﬂuctuations increases at higher redshifts. Dark matter halo
mass resolution in simulations must be suﬃcient (at least
better than ∼1010h−1M(cid:12)) in order to properly predict the
21cm brightness temperature signal. With correct modelling
of the distribution of HI-selected galaxies, 21cm intensity
mapping surveys will provide a window to understanding of
the small mass galaxy formation physics.
