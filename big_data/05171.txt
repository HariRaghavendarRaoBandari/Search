COALESCENCE OF EUCLIDEAN GEODESICS ON THE

POISSON-DELAUNAY TRIANGULATION

DAVID COUPIER AND CHRISTIAN HIRSCH

Abstract. Let us consider Euclidean ﬁrst-passage percolation on the Poisson-Delaunay tri-
angulation. We prove almost sure coalescence of any two semi-inﬁnite geodesics with the same
asymptotic direction. The proof is based on an adapted Burton-Keane argument and makes
use of the concentration property for shortest-path lengths in the considered graphs. Moreover,
by considering the speciﬁc example of the relative neighborhood graph, we illustrate that our
approach extends to further well-known graphs in computational geometry. As an application,
we show that the expected number of semi-inﬁnite geodesics starting at a given vertex and
leaving a disk of a certain radius grows at most sublinearly in the radius.

1. Introduction and main results

1.1. Introduction. In the seminal papers [13, 14] Licea and Newman have shown coalescence
of a large class of geodesics with the same direction in the standard two-dimensional lattice ﬁrst-
passage percolation (FPP) model. To be more precise, for Lebesgue-almost every direction, any
two geodesics with this direction starting from diﬀerent initial points coalesce with probability
1. Later, Howard and Newman have investigated an isotropic ﬁrst-passage percolation model
based on the homogeneous Poisson point process in the plane [9, 10]. Due to the property of
isotropy, they could derive an analogous coalescence statement for any ﬁxed direction.

As of today, the coalescence of geodesics has been extended to further isotropic models of
continuum percolation. For instance, in [15] a Euclidean FPP model is considered on the
Poisson-Delaunay triangulation, where the edge weights are independent and identically dis-
tributed according to an absolutely continuous distribution on [0,∞). In the present paper, we
extend the coalescence result to the case where the edge weights are dependent and given by
the Euclidean length ν1(e) of the corresponding edge e. Due to the strong dependence between
edge weights and the underlying graph structure, local modiﬁcation arguments that have been
successfully applied in [15] do not carry over to the setting of Euclidean edge weights. We there-
fore develop a novel adaptation of the Burton-Keane argument. In our approach, a central role
is played by a modiﬁed FPP model, where geodesics are forbidden to backtrack behind certain
vertical lines. Moreover, we show that our general approach is not restricted to the Delaunay
triangulation, but can also be applied to other graphs of interest in computational geometry.
As a speciﬁc example, we provide explicitly the adaptations that are needed to deal with the
Poisson relative neighborhood graph.

In order to state our main results precisely, we ﬁrst recall the deﬁnitions of the Delaunay
triangulation and the relative neighborhood graph and refer the reader to [11] for further prop-
erties. Let us start with a set of vertices in R2 given by a homogeneous Poisson point process X
whose intensity is assumed to be equal to 1. Then, the Delaunay triangulation Del(X) on X, is
the geometric graph on the vertex set X, where an edge is drawn between two vertices x, y ∈ X
if and only if there exists a disk whose intersection with the vertex set X consists precisely of
the points x and y. The relative neighborhood graph Rng(X) on X, is the geometric graph on

the vertex set X where an edge is drawn between two vertices x, y ∈ X if and only if there does
not exist a vertex z ∈ X such that max{|x − z|,|y − z|} < |x − y|. In particular, almost surely,
the relative neighborhood graph is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation. In the following,
many results hold for both Del(X) and Rng(X). Hence, we write G(X) as notation to represent
either of these graphs. Also, letters x, x′, y, z will refer to elements of X.

Next, let us introduce a Euclidean FPP model on G(X) and explain the notion of geodesics.
Let P, P ′ ∈ R2 be points that are contained on the edge set of G(X). Then, we denote by
ℓ(P, P ′) = ℓG(X)(P, P ′) the Euclidean length ν1(γ) of the shortest Euclidean path γ on G(X)
connecting P and P ′. That is,

ℓ(P, P ′) = inf{ν1(γ) : γ is a path on G(X) connecting P and P ′} .

(1)
For any path γ on G(X) and P, P ′ ∈ γ, we write γ[P, P ′] for the subpath of γ starting at P
and ending at P ′. When the (possibly inﬁnite) path γ satisﬁes ℓ(P, P ′) = ν1(γ[P, P ′]) for all
P, P ′ ∈ γ, then γ is called geodesic.
The present paper investigates geodesics γ on G(X) that are semi-inﬁnite in the sense that
γ emanates from a certain starting point but consists of inﬁnitely many vertices. Moreover,
writing S1 = {P ∈ R2 : |P| = 1} for the unit circle, we say that a semi-inﬁnite path γ on G(X)
admits an asymptotic direction ˆu ∈ S1 if and only if

= ˆu .

Let ˆu ∈ S1 be an arbitrary direction. Based on the classical arguments developed in [9, 13],
it is proved in [8] that almost surely, for every point x ∈ X, there exists a unique semi-inﬁnite
geodesic starting at x and with asymptotic direction ˆu. Using the terminology of [13], this
geodesic is called ˆu-unigeodesic and will be denoted by γx in the following. Note that, γx
obviously depends on the direction ˆu, but since in our paper this direction will always be clear
from the context, we adhere to the simpliﬁed notation.

1.2. Coalescence of geodesics. The ﬁrst main result of our paper establishes the coalescence
of ˆu-unigeodesics.
Theorem 1. Consider Euclidean FPP on G(X). Then, for any given direction ˆu ∈ S1, with
probability 1 any two geodesics with asymptotic direction ˆu eventually coalesce. That is, γx ∩
γx′ 6= ∅ for all x, x′ ∈ X.

On a very general level, the proof of Theorem 1 is based on the Burton-Keane technique that
has emerged as a powerful tool in the analysis of random planar trees [5, 9, 13, 15]. However,
the implementation of the Burton-Keane argument for Euclidean FPP on the Poisson-Delaunay
triangulation Del(X) and the Poisson relative neighborhood graph Rng(X) is markedly diﬀerent
from the examples that have been discussed in the literature so far. Let us explain why.

The classical argument of Burton-Keane starts by assuming that there exist ˆu-unigeodesics
that do not coalesce. Then, a local modiﬁcation argument is used to show that each of these
geodesics has a positive probability to be surrounded by a protective shield. This shield prevents
that distant geodesics coalesce with it. In particular, the expected number of shielded – and
therefore non-coalescent – geodesics in a bounded box grows as the box area. This contradicts
the fact that the expected number of edges of G(X) crossing the box boundary grows as the
box perimeter, i.e., as the square root of the box area. In a given FPP model, the diﬃculty of
carrying out this program lies in the local modiﬁcation step.

For instance, in the setting of iid edge weights [13, 15], a simple modiﬁcation of edge weights
makes it possible to generate shields that are avoided by the geodesics starting outside such
obstacles. Indeed, by choosing suﬃciently large weights, these geodesics are forced to circumvent
the shielded area. Conversely, in Euclidean FPP models such as the ones considered in [9] and
the present paper, the weights are determined by the locations of the vertices given by a Poisson
point process. There is no additional source of randomness on which one could rely. Hence, any
local modiﬁcation step must modify the Poisson point process itself. The classical Euclidean

2

FPP model considered in [9] is based on the complete graph on a Poisson point process where
weights are given by certain powers of the Euclidean distance. In particular, the absence of
a graph topology entails a powerful monotonicity property: removing Poisson points can only
increase shortest-path lengths. This makes it possible to create obstacles by deleting Poisson
points in a large region without modifying the geodesics.

The main challenge in analyzing Euclidean FPP on the Delaunay triangulation Del(X) and
the relative neighborhood graph Rng(X) lies in the lack of a related monotonicity property.
Indeed, in both models, the removal of Poisson points has two opposite eﬀects. First, this
invalidates paths passing through a deleted vertex, and then increases shortest-path lengths (as
in the previous Euclidean FPP models). Second, deleting vertices also has the possibility of
unblocking certain edges which can potentially decrease shortest-path lengths when they ap-
pear. This self-healing property makes it much harder to describe the eﬀect of removing points.
Therefore, Euclidean FPP on the Delaunay triangulation Del(X) and the relative neighbor-
hood graph Rng(X) are markedly diﬀerent from the FPP models previously considered in the
literature [9, 13, 15] and requires us to give to the Burton-Keane approach of [9, 13] a new twist.
The key idea for the proof of Theorem 1 is to consider a modiﬁed Euclidean FPP model in
which geodesics are preserved under certain local modiﬁcations. More precisely, this modiﬁed
FPP model forbids geodesics to backtrack behind a given vertical line. This allows us to im-
plement local modiﬁcations to the left of that line without inﬂuencing geodesics to the right
of it. Hence, we are able to construct in the modiﬁed FPP model a family of non-coalescent
geodesics whose mean number grows as the box area. However, in general these new geodesics
are no longer geodesics in the original FPP model.

In order to illustrate the generality of our approach, we stress that shortest-path lengths on
the Delaunay triangulation may behave quite diﬀerently to shortest-path lengths on the relative
neighborhood graph. Indeed, it is known that the Delaunay triangulation is a spanner [7, 12].
That is, when constructing the Delaunay triangulation from an arbitrary locally ﬁnite set, any
two vertices can be connected by a path whose length is at most 4√3π/9 times the Euclidean
distance between these vertices. In contrast, starting from an arbitrary inﬁnite set, the relative
neighborhood even need not necessarily be connected. Nevertheless, using a Poisson point
process as vertex set, Euclidean FPP both on the Delaunay triangulation and the relative
neighborhood graph are well-behaved asymptotically. More precisely, as a key tool in the proof
of Theorem 1, we leverage recently established results on concentration of shortest-path lengths
on the Poisson-Delaunay triangulation and the Poisson relative neighborhood graph [8]. Even if
the spanner-property of the Delaunay triangulation makes it impossible to punish the passage
through obstacles by arbitrarily high costs, the strong concentration of shortest-path lengths
implies that creating obstacles with moderately high costs is suﬃcient for achieving the desired
shielding eﬀect.

1.3. Sublinearity of the number of geodesics leaving large disks. Let x⋆ be the closest
Poisson point to the origin o ∈ R2. We denote by Tx⋆ the collection of geodesics γx⋆,x, for
any x ∈ X, where γx⋆,x is the shortest Euclidean path on G(X) connecting x⋆ and x. The
continuous nature of the underlying Poisson point process X ensures the a.s. uniqueness of
geodesics. Hence, Tx⋆ is a.s. a tree rooted at x⋆, called the shortest-path tree on the graph G(X)
w.r.t. the root x⋆.
From the moderate deviations result obtained in [8, Theorem 2] for the geodesics γx,x′
(w.r.t. the straight line segment connecting x and x′) and the general method developed in [10,
Proposition 2.8], the following statement holds with probability 1: for every direction ˆu ∈ S1,
there exists at least one semi-inﬁnite geodesic in Tx⋆ starting from x⋆ with asymptotic direction
ˆu. As a consequence, the tree Tx⋆ a.s. admits an inﬁnite number of semi-inﬁnite geodesics (in
all the directions).
As the second main result of this paper, we show that this (expected) number is asymp-
totically sublinear. To do it, let us denote by χr the number of semi-inﬁnite geodesics in Tx⋆

3

crossing the circle Sr(o) = rS1. Since these geodesics may cross various times any given circle,
we have to be more precise. Let us consider the graph obtained from Tx⋆ after deleting any
geodesic (x⋆, x2, . . . , xn) with n ≥ 2 (except the endpoint xn) such that the Poisson points
x⋆, x2, . . . , xn−1 belong to the disk Br(o) = {P ∈ R2 : |P| ≤ 1} but not xn. Then, χr counts the
unbounded connected components of this graph. Thus, let us consider a direction ˆu ∈ S1 and
a real number c > 0. Among the previous unbounded connected components, the ones coming
from an edge (xn−1, xn) whose segment [xn−1; xn] crosses the arc of the circle Sr(o) centered at
rˆu and with length c, are counted by χr(ˆu, c). Using this notation, we state:
Theorem 2. Let ˆu ∈ S1 and c > 0. Then,

(2)

lim
r→∞

r−1Eχr = 0 and

Eχr(ˆu, c) = 0 .

lim
r→∞

The ﬁrst limit of (2) can be understood as follows. Among all the edges of Tx⋆ crossing
the circle Sr(o), whose mean number is of order r, a very small number of them belong to
semi-inﬁnite geodesics.

The ﬁrst limit r−1Eχr → 0 immediately follows from the directional result Eχr(ˆu, c) → 0,
since by isotropy Eχr = rEχr(ˆu, 2π), for any ˆu ∈ S1. To state a null limit for the expectation
of χr(ˆu, 2π) we follow the general method developed in [4]. This method essentially relies on
two ingredients: a local approximation (in distribution) of the tree Tx⋆ far away from its root
by a suitable directed forest and the a.s. absence of bi-inﬁnite geodesics in this directed forest.
Actually, this absence of bi-inﬁnite geodesics is a consequence of the coalescence of all the
semi-inﬁnite geodesics having the same asymptotic direction, i.e., Theorem 1.

Observe that thanks to the translation invariance of the graph G(X), Theorem 2 remains

true whatever the Poisson point x of X at which the considered tree is rooted.

Finally, although the product r−1χr is conjectured to converge to 0 almost surely, we can
prove following ideas of [4, Section 3.2] that χr(ˆu, c) does not tend to 0 with probability 1. More
precisely, for any ˆu ∈ S1 and c > 0:

a.s.

lim sup
r→∞

χr(ˆu, c) ≥ 1 .

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2.1, the modiﬁed Euclidean FPP
model is deﬁned. Existence and uniqueness of its geodesics are discussed. Section 2.2 is devoted
to the outline of the proof of Theorem 1: the Burton-Keane argument is applied to the modiﬁed
FPP model. But the heart of the proof, i.e., Proposition 4, is proved in Section 3. Finally,
Section 4 provides a proof of Theorem 2.

2. The adapted Burton-Keane argument

In this section, G(X) still denotes the Delaunay triangulation Del(X) and the relative neigh-
borhood graph Rng(X) deﬁned on the Poisson point process X. Our goal is to apply the
Burton-Keane argument to a modiﬁed Euclidean FPP model deﬁned as follows.
2.1. The modiﬁed Euclidean FPP model. Let r ∈ R and let us consider a modiﬁed FPP
model on the graph G(X) in which the length of an oriented path is given by its Euclidean
length, unless it crosses the vertical line lv
r = {r} × R from right to left. In the latter case,
its length is deﬁned to be inﬁnite. This is the reason why from now on, we have to consider
oriented paths.

Let γ = (x1, . . . , xk) be an oriented path in G(X) where x1, . . . , xk are Poisson points. We

set

1 (γ) =(∞

ν1(γ)

if π1(xj) ≥ r ≥ π1(xj+1) for some j ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1},
otherwise,

where π1 : R2 → R denotes the projection onto the ﬁrst coordinate. As before, an oriented path
γ = (xj)1≤j≤k with k ∈ N ∪ {∞} on G(X) is called geodesic with respect to ν(r)

where γ[xi, xj] denotes the (oriented) sub-path of γ from xi to xj. We also make the convention
that an oriented path crossing the vertical line lv

r from right to left cannot be a geodesic.

Let us remark that geodesics of the modiﬁed FPP model, that is, w.r.t. ν(r)

r only one time. Besides, the geodesic w.r.t. ν(r)

1 , can be markedly
diﬀerent from the ones of the original FPP model. To see it, let us consider x, x′ ∈ X such that
π1(x) < r < π1(x′) and let γ be the geodesic connecting x and x′ in the original FPP model.
Then, the geodesic w.r.t. ν(r)
from x to x′ is equal to γ (up to the orientation) if and only if γ
1
from x′ to x do not
crosses the vertical line lv
exist. Also, let us remark in the relative neighborhood graph Rng(X) it can happen that the
only edge starting from x crosses the vertical line lv
r from right to left. In this case, there is no
(ﬁnite or not) geodesic starting at x in the modiﬁed FPP model. Such pathological situations
do not occur in the Delaunay triangulation Del(X). Besides, in the modiﬁed FPP model on
Del(X), it should be possible to prove existence of ˆu-unigeodesics for any asymptotic direction
ˆu such that hˆu, e1i ≥ 0 and starting from any vertex x, using [10, Proposition 2.8]. However,
this would still require some eﬀort and will not be needed in the following.
Unlike existence, uniqueness of ˆu-unigeodesics – when they exist – in the modiﬁed FPP model
is established fairly easily. Indeed, the classical argument due to Licea and Newman [13] shows
that if ˆu ∈ S1 is chosen suitably, then for each vertex x ∈ G(X) there exists at most one
semi-inﬁnite geodesic w.r.t. ν(r)
1 with asymptotic direction ˆu and starting point x. When it
exists, it will be denoted γ(r)
x .

1

To make the presentation self-contained, we reproduce from [13, Theorem 0] the original
argument for the uniqueness of ˆu-unigeodesics. See also [9, Lemma 6] for another account. Let

1

Dr(ˆu) be the event that for every x ∈ X there exists at most one ˆu-unigeodesic w.r.t. ν(r)
starting from x. By stationarity, the probability of the event Dr(ˆu) does not depend on the
value of r ∈ R.
Lemma 3. It holds that RS1 P(D0(ˆu)c)dˆu = 0 where dˆu denotes the Lebesgue measure on S1.
In other words, for almost every ˆu ∈ S1, P(D0(ˆu)) = 1.
Proof. If D0(ˆu) does not occur, then there exists some point x ∈ X featuring two ˆu-unigeodesics
γ1 and γ2 that have x as their only common point. Let x1, x2 be the respective successors of x
in these geodesics. Writing γ+(x), γ−(x) for the trigonometrically highest and lowest geodesics
w.r.t. ν(0)
in G(X) starting from x ∈ X, we conclude from the planarity of G(X) that at least
1
one of γ+(x1), γ+(x2), γ−(x1) and γ−(x2) is trapped between γ1 and γ2. Hence, its asymptotic
In other words, we have D0(ˆu)c ⊂ H(ˆu), where H(ˆu) denotes
direction is also given by ˆu.
the event that there exists x ∈ X such that γ−(x) or γ+(x) has asymptotic direction ˆu. Since
in each realization, the event H(ˆu) can occur only for two directions of S1, we deduce that
RS1 1{H(ˆu)}dˆu = 0. Hence, by Fubini’s theorem,

ZS1

P(D0(ˆu)c)dˆu ≤ZS1

P(H(ˆu))dˆu = EZS1

1{H(ˆu)}dˆu = 0,

(cid:3)

as required.

In the following, we choose a direction ˆu0 ∈ S1 such that P(D0(ˆu0)) = 1 and the absolute
value of the angle of ˆu0 with the x-axis is at most δ, where δ > 0 is assumed to be the inverse
of a suﬃciently large integer, which is ﬁxed in the entire manuscript.

2.2. Outline of the proof of Theorem 1. Next, we introduce an event FM to describe the
existence of a distinguished geodesic in the modiﬁed FPP model that is protected from coalescing
with other distinguished geodesics. To make this precise we require additional notations. Given
a semi-inﬁnite path γ of G(X) and a point P ∈ γ, we denote by γ[P ] the semi-inﬁnite subpath of
γ starting at P . Let H− = (−∞, 0]×R and H + = [0,∞)×R be the negative and positive vertical
half-plane, respectively. We also denote by Cδ(P ) the cone with apex P ∈ R2, asymptotic
direction ˆu0 and opening angle δ.

We now consider the family of ˆu0-unigeodesics {γx}x∈X in the original FPP model on G(X).
This family can be used to deﬁne a forest F = Fˆu0 with vertex set X by drawing an edge
from x to y if [x, y] is the ﬁrst edge in the geodesic γx. If N denotes the number of connected
components in this forest, then Theorem 1 is equivalent to the assertion that P(N ≥ 2) = 0.
Of course, by isotropy, we could choose ˆu0 = e1, but for our argument it will be notationally
convenient to have a certain ﬂexibility in the choice of the direction. We will always assume
that the angle between ˆu0 and e1 is at most δ.

The heart of our paper is to show that the event FM occurs with positive probability if the

event {N ≥ 2} does so. Its proof is devoted to Section 3.
Proposition 4. If P(N ≥ 2) > 0, then P(FM ) > 0 for M large enough.

The ﬁnal part of the proof of Theorem 1 is to prove that P(FM ) = 0. In contrast to Proposi-
tion 4, the classical argument [13, Theorem 1] applies without substantial further complications.

Proposition 5. It holds that P(FM ) = 0, for M large enough.

6

Proof of Proposition 5. By Lemma 4, we may ﬁx M ≥ 1 such that P(FM ) > 0. For L ≥ 1 let
f (L) denote the number of z ∈ (4Z ∩ [−4L, 4L]) × (2Z ∩ [−2L, 2L]) such that (X − M z) ∈ FM .
Then, by stationarity of G(X) and the choice of M , the ﬁrst moment of f (L) grows quadratically
in L. On the other hand, let f′(L) denote the number of edges in G(X) intersecting the boundary
of [−8LM, 8LM ] × [−4LM, 4LM ]. Then Ef′(L) grows linearly in L. Hence, it suﬃces to show
that if L is suﬃciently large, then f (L) ≤ f′(L) holds almost surely.
In order to prove this claim, let z, z′ ∈ (4Z∩ [−4L, 4L])× (2Z∩ [−2L, 2L]) be such that z 6= z′,
and γz ′,m = γ(M π1(z ′))
(X − M z) ∈ FM and (X − M z′) ∈ FM . Furthermore, let γz,m = γ(M π1(z))
denote the geodesics that are guaranteed by the events (X − M z) ∈ FM and (X − M z′) ∈ FM .
Then, we claim that γz,m and γz ′,m do not leave the rectangle [−8LM, 8LM ]×[−4LM, 4LM ] via
the same edge. Indeed, without loss of generality, we may assume that π1(z) ≤ π1(z′). If π1(z) =
π1(z′), then we know from the deﬁnition of FM that γz,m and γz ′,m are disjoint. Hence, we may
assume that π1(z) < π1(z′). Since X − M z ∈ FM , the geodesic γz,m is contained in the cone
Cδ(Q) ⊕ BδM (o), where {Q} = [x−z,m, x+
z,m] ∩ lv
M z. Hence, we conclude that the last intersection
point P of γz,m with the vertical line lv
M z ′ is contained in [−8LM, 8LM ]× [−4LM, 4LM ]. Now,
the occurrence of the event FM implies that γz,m[P ] and γz ′,m are disjoint, so that they leave
the rectangle [−8LM, 8LM ] × [−4LM, 4LM ] via diﬀerent edges.

3. Proof of Proposition 4

Since the proof of Proposition 4 is rather long, we provide the reader with a brief outlook.
We are going to deﬁne three events EM , A′M and A′′M such that their intersection implies FM
and occurs with positive probability, therefore proving Proposition 4.

The event EM mainly ensures the existence of three disjoint geodesics γu, γm and γd, all
starting from the segment {0} × [−δM, δM ] and included in H +. As in the classic Burton-
Keane argument, the role of γu and γd is to protect γm from above and below, respectively.
In Lemma 6, it is proved that the event {X ∈ EM} occurs with high probability whenever
P(N ≥ 2) > 0.
To protect γm from the left, we turn the (4M × 2M )-box RM = [−4M, 0] × [−M, M ] into
an obstacle. To do it, we ﬁrst assume that the Poisson point process X does not contain any
points in the (3M × 2M )-box R−M = [−4M,−M ]× [−M, M ]. This results in a structural change
of the Delaunay triangulation inside R−M , which is illustrated in Figure 2. To ensure that the
sketch in Figure 2 is accurate, we need to make some assumptions on the conﬁguration of X
outside R−M . This is the role of the event A′M . Let us set X (1) = X \ R−M . Lemma 11 says
that P(X (1) ∈ A′M ) tends to 1 as M → ∞. Moreover, under the event {X (1) ∈ A′M}, the events
{X (1) ∈ EM} and {X ∈ EM} are equivalent.

{X (1) ∈ A′M}.

Third, we need a certain control over lengths of geodesics in G(X). This property will be
encoded in an event A′′M that only depends on the conﬁguration of X in R2 \ R−M . We will see
in Lemma 13 that P(X (1) ∈ A′′M ) tends to 1 as M → ∞.

Finally, we will show in Lemma 14 that X (1) ∈ EM ∩ A′M ∩ A′′M almost surely implies that

X (1) ∈ FM . Hence, the following computation proves Proposition 4:

0 < P(X (1) ∈ EM ∩ A′M ∩ A′′M )P(X ∩ R−M = ∅)
= P(X (1) ∈ EM ∩ A′M ∩ A′′M , X ∩ R−M = ∅)
≤ P(X (1) ∈ FM , X ∩ R−M = ∅)
≤ P(X ∈ FM ).

3.1. The event EM . In this section, using the assumption that P(N ≥ 2) > 0, we explain how
to protect the geodesic γm from above and below by two semi-inﬁnite geodesics γu and γd which
do not coalesce with γm.

As the main result of this section, we can construct the desired distinguished geodesics. For

M ≥ 1, we let EM denote the event that there exist

Pu, Pm, Pd ∈ G(X) ∩ ({0} × [−δM, δM ]),

such that

(i) π2(Pu) > π2(Pm) > π2(Pd), and
(ii) γu, γm and γd exist and are disjoint, where we put γu = γ(0)

and γd = γ(0)

Now, we show that the event EM occurs with high probability.
Lemma 6. If P(N ≥ 2) > 0, then limM→∞ P(EM ) = 1.
Proof. As a ﬁrst step, we consider geodesics that do not backtrack behind the vertical line lv
0.
More precisely, we deﬁne the linear point process Y to consist of those P ∈ lv
0 that can be
0, where x−, x+ ∈ X are assumed to be connected by an edge in
represented as P = [x−, x+] ∩ lv
G(X). Moreover, we put γP = γx+, where we assume that x+ is chosen such that π1(x+) > 0.
Then, we let Y ′ ⊂ Y denote the thinning of Y consisting of all P ∈ Y for which the geodesic γP
is contained in the positive half-plane H +. In the following, it will play an important role that if
γP is a geodesic in G(X) with respect to ν1 and P ∈ Y ′, then γP is also a geodesic with respect
to ν(0)
0 with the real line, we think of Y ′ as one-dimensional
stationary and ergodic point process. Since γP has asymptotic direction ˆu0, the intensity of Y ′
is positive when regarded as one-dimensional point process.

1 , i.e., γP = γ(0)
P .

Identifying lv

In the following, it will be important to exert some control over the amount of ﬂuctuation of
the distinguished geodesics. More precisely, the deﬁnition of asymptotic direction shows that
for every P = [x−, x+] ∩ lv
0 ∈ Y ′ there exists a random k > 0 such that |x− − x+| ≤ k and
γP ⊂ Cδ(P ) ⊕ Bk(o). In particular, there exists a deterministic K0 > 0 such that the thinning
0 ∈ Y ′ such that |x− − x+| ≤ K0 and γP is contained
Y ′′ of Y ′ consisting of all P = [x−, x+] ∩ lv
in the dilated cone Cδ(P ) ⊕ BK0(o) forms a stationary and ergodic point process with positive
intensity. The retention condition for Y ′′ is illustrated in Figure 3.

First, we claim that for every t ∈ R the probability that the geodesics γP coalesce for all
P ∈ Y ′′ ∩ ({0} × [t,∞)) is equal to 0. Indeed, otherwise stationarity and planarity would imply
that P(N ≥ 2) = 0. In particular,

P(E′M ) = 1,

where E′M denotes the event that there exist P, P ′, P ′′ ∈ Y ′′ ∩ ({0} × R) such that

(ii) the geodesics γP , γP ′ and γP ′′ are pairwise non-coalescent.

(cid:3)

The following result shows that Lemma 6 allows us to restrict our attention to potential
coalescence of γm with geodesics that cross the segment {0} × [−δM, δM ]. Recall that if γ is
an arbitrary oriented path in G(X) and P ∈ γ, then γ[P ] denotes the oriented subpath of γ
starting at P .
Lemma 7. Let z ∈ 4Z × 2Z be such that z 6= o and π1(z) ≤ 0. Then, almost surely under the
event EM , the following assertion holds. If x− ∈ X ∩ (M z + H−) and x+ ∈ X ∩ (M z + H +)
are such that

(i) [x−, x+] forms an edge in G(X) that is contained in BM/2(M z),
(ii) γ = γ(M π1(z))
(iii) γ[P ] ∩ γm 6= ∅, where P denotes the last intersection point of γ and lv
0,

exists, and

x+

u ] ∪ γu and [x−d , x+

then |π2(P )| ≤ δM .
Proof. In order to derive a contradiction, we assume that |π2(P )| > δM . Since γm is enclosed
by the union of {0} × [−δM, δM ], [x−u , x+
d ] ∪ γd, we deduce that γ[P ] has a
common vertex with γu or γd. We let x be the last such point and assume that it lies on γu.
Then, γ[x] and γu[x] are two distinct ˆu0-geodesics in G(X) with respect to ν(0)
1 , contradicting
Lemma 3 and the choice of ˆu0.
(cid:3)
Remark 1. Note that if π1(z) = 0, then it is impossible to obtain |π2(P )| ≤ δM . Hence, in this
case the event EM already suﬃces to ensure that γ[P ] ∩ γm = ∅.
3.2. The event A′M . The second part of the shield is obtained by changing the Poisson point
process in (3M × 2M )-box R−M = [−4M,−M ] × [−M, M ] so as to increase the cost of passing
through the rectangle RM . An important feature in our choice of the event EM is that it only
involves geodesics in G(X) with respect to ν(0)
1 , but not ν1. Hence, if the modiﬁcations in
R−M are organized such that they do not inﬂuence the conﬁguration of G(X) in H +, then the
occurrence of the event EM is not inﬂuenced by this modiﬁcation. We stress that the latter
implication was false if we considered geodesics in G(X) with respect to ν1 and not ν(0)
1 .

First, we introduce a family of events {A′M,1}M≥1 guaranteeing that changes of the Poisson
point process within R−M do not inﬂuence the Delaunay triangulation or the relative neighbor-
hood graph outside the dilated rectangle R−M ⊕ Q8εM (o). Here we put ε = ε(M ) = M−31/32
and Q8εM (o) = [−4εM, 4εM ]2. To be more precise, we subdivide (R−M ⊕ QM (o)) \ R−M into

KM = (4ε−1)(3ε−1) − (3ε−1)(2ε−1) = 6ε−2

congruent subsquares Qi = QεM (vi) of side length εM , where we assume that ε−1 is an integer.
Then, we write {X (1) ∈ A′M,1} if #(X (1) ∩ Qi) ∈ (0, 2ε2M 2) holds for all 1 ≤ i ≤ KM . Since
#(X (1) ∩ Qi) is Poisson-distributed with parameter ε2M 2, the probability of the event A′M,1
tends to 1 as M → ∞. Next, we show that under {X ∈ A′M,1} the Delaunay triangulation and
the relative neighborhood graph exhibit stabilization outside R−M ⊕ Q8εM (o).
Lemma 8. If X (1) ∈ A′M,1, then

G(X (1) ∪ ψ) \ (R−M ⊕ Q8εM (o)) = G(X (1)) \ (R−M ⊕ Q8εM (o))

holds for every ﬁnite subset ψ of R−M .
Proof. We only provide the proof for the Delaunay triangulation, since the case of the relative
neighborhood graph is similar but easier. In order to derive a contradiction, assume that we
could ﬁnd ﬁnite subsets ψ, ψ′ ⊂ R−M and an edge e in Del(X (1) ∪ ψ) such that i) at least one

9

end point of e is outside R−M ⊕ Q8εM (o) and ii) e is not an edge in Del(X (1) ∪ ψ′). Then, there
exists a disk D containing e and no points of X (1) ∪ ψ in its interior. Note that D does not
intersect R−M , since otherwise it would cover one of the cubes Qi, contradicting the assumption
that X (1) ∩ Qi 6= ∅. Hence, D ∩ R−M = ∅ and therefore e is also an edge in Del(X (1) ∪ ψ).

(cid:3)

Moreover, we show that under the event {A′M,1}M≥1 the sketch provided in Figure 2 is

accurate.
Lemma 9. If X (1) ∈ A′M,1, then

(i) there exists an edge [x, y] in Del(X (1)) with max{|π1(x) + 2M|,|π1(y) + 2M|} ≤ 8√εM ,
(ii) for every ρ ∈ [8ε, 1 − 8ε] there exists an edge [x, y] in Del(X (1)) such that

π2(x) ≥ M and π2(y) ≤ −M ,
(a) max{|π1(x) − (−1 − ρ)M|,|π2(y) − (1 − ρ)M|} ≤ 8√εM , and
(b) 0 ≤ π2(x) − M ≤ 8εM and 0 ≤ π1(y) + M ≤ 8εM .

Proof. Fix P0 = ((−2 − 8ε)M, 0) and consider the disk D = B(1+8ε)M (P0) of radius M + 8εM .
First, by the choice of the subsquares Qi, there exist x′, y′ ∈ X (1) ∩ D with π2(x′) ≥ M and
π2(y′) ≤ −M . Conversely, we claim that if x ∈ X (1) ∩ D and |π2(x)| ≥ M , then |π1(x) + 2M| ≤
8√εM . Indeed,

(π1(x) − (−2 − 8ε)M )2

3M

,

8εM ≥ |x − P0| − M =
so that

(π1(x) − (−2 − 8ε)M )2 + π2(x)2 − M 2
p(π1(x) − (−2 − 8ε)M )2 + π2(x)2 + M ≥

|π1(x) + 2M| ≤ |π1(x) − (−2 − 8ε)M| + 8εM ≤ 2√6εM + 8εM,

which is smaller than 8√εM if M is suﬃciently large. In particular, shrinking the disk D until
it contains precisely one x ∈ X (1) with π2(x) ≥ M and one y ∈ X (1) with π2(y) ≤ −M proves
the ﬁrst claim.
For the second claim, we proceed similarly, but for the convenience of the reader, we provide
some details. For ρ ∈ [8ε, 1 − 8ε], we ﬁx P0 = ((−1 − ρ)M, (1 − ρ)M ) and consider the disk
D = BρM +8εM (P0) of radius ρM + 8εM centered at P0. Again, the choice of the subsquares Qi
implies that there exist x′, y′ ∈ X (1) ∩ D with π2(x′) ≥ M and π1(y′) ≥ −M . Conversely, we
claim that if x ∈ X (1) ∩ D and π2(x) ≥ M , then |π1(x) + (1 + ρ)M| ≤ 4√εM . Indeed, as before,

8εM ≥

so that

(π1(x) − (−1 − ρ)M )2 + (π2(x) − (1 − ρ)M )2 − ρ2M 2
p(π1(x) − (−1 − ρ)M )2 + (π2(x) − (1 − ρ)M )2 + ρM ≥

|π1(x) − (−1 − ρ)M| ≤ 4√εM.

(π1(x) − (−1 − ρ)M )2

,

2M

By an analogous computation, we see that if y ∈ X (1) ∩ D and π1(y) ≥ −M , then |π2(y) −
(1 − ρ)M| ≤ 4√εM . Similar as in the previous case, shrinking D until it contains precisely one
x ∈ X (1) with π2(x) ≥ M and one y ∈ X (1) with π1(y) ≥ −M constructs the desired edge. (cid:3)
Remark 2. In particular, under the event A′M,1, if γ is a path in G(X) that starts in H− \ RM ,
intersects the segment {0}× [−δM, δM ] but does not intersect the area [−(1 + 8√ε)M, 0]× (R\
[−M, M ]), then γ intersects the union of segments [(−2 − 8√ε)M, (−1 + 8√ε)M ] × {±M}.

Moreover, we obtain very precise control over the behavior of edges in Del(X (1)) intersecting

the horizontal segment [−2M,−M ] × {M}.
Corollary 10. Assume X (1) ∈ A′M,1 and that e is an edge of Del(X (1)) intersecting the segment
[(−2 + δ)M, (−1 − δ)M ] × {M} at some point P1 and write π1(P1) = (−1 − ρ)M . Then, e
intersects the vertical segment

and therefore the length of e is bounded below by (√2ρ − 32√ε)M .

{−M} × [(1 − ρ − 32√ε)M, (1 − ρ + 32√ε)M ],

10

Proof. By Lemma 9 there exist x, x′, y, y′ ∈ X such that [x, y] and [x′, y′] are edges in Del(X)
with the following properties.

(i) max{|π1(x) − (−1 − ρ − 16√ε)M|,|π2(y) − (1 − ρ − 16√ε)M|} ≤ 8√εM ,
(ii) max{|π1(x′) − (−1 − ρ + 16√ε)M|,|π2(y′) − (1 − ρ + 16√ε)M|} ≤ 8√εM ,
(iii) π2(x), π2(x′) ∈ [M, (1 + 8ε)M ] and π1(y), π1(y′) ∈ [−M, (−1 + 8ε)M ].

If we let P2 denote the intersection point of [x, y] with the horizontal segment [−2M,−M ]×{M},
then

|π1(P2) − (−1 − ρ)M| ∈ [−26√εM,−6√εM ].

Similarly, if P ′2 denotes the intersection point of [x′, y′] with the horizontal segment [−2M,−M ],
then

|π1(P ′2) − (−1 − ρ)M| ∈ [6√εM, 26√εM ].

As similar relations can be obtained for the intersections P3, P ′3 of [x, y] and [x′, y′] with the
vertical segment {−M}×[0, M ], we see that e is trapped between [x, y] and [x′, y′]. In particular,
e intersects the vertical segment {−M} × (π2(P3), π2(P ′3)). Since,

(1 − ρ − 26√ε)M ≤ π2(P3) ≤ π2(P ′3) ≤ (1 − ρ + 26√ε)M

this completes the proof.
Remark 3. A similar result holds if e intersects the segment [(−2 − δ)M, (−2 + δ)M ] × {M}.
However, for those edges there are two options. Either they intersect the vertical segment
{−M}× R close to the point (−M, 0) or they intersect the horizontal segment R×{−M} close
to the point (−2M,−M ).
Remark 4. Since the relative neighborhood graph is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation,
Corollary 10 and the previous remark can be used to show that if X (1) ∈ A′M,1, then Rng(X (1))
does not contain an edge intersecting the segment [(−2 − δ)M, (−1 − δ)M ] × {M}.

(cid:3)

In addition to the stabilization property, it will also be important to know that shortest path-
lengths of G(X (1)) in the annulus (R−M ⊕ QM (o)) \ R−M are not too long. Since shortest-path
lengths in the relative neighborhood graph are closely related to descending chains [1, Lemmas
10], we ﬁrst recall the notion of descending chains from [6]. For b ≥ 1 we say that a sequence
of distinct vertices Xi1, . . . , Xin ∈ X (1) forms a b-bounded descending chain if

b ≥ |Xi1 − Xi2| ≥ ··· ≥ |Xin−1 − Xin|.

Now, we say that the event A′M,2 occurs if every 16εM -bounded descending chain of X (1)
starting in R−M ⊕ QM (o) consists of at most 104ε2M 2 hops. Finally, we put A′M = A′M,1 ∩ A′M,2.
Using the results from [6], we show that the events A′M occur with high probability.
Lemma 11. It holds that limM→∞ P(X (1) ∈ A′M ) = 1.
Proof. Since we have already seen that P(A′M,1) tends to 1 as M → ∞, it suﬃces to show
that limM→∞ P(A′M,2) = 1. First, monotonicity of descending chains allows us to prove this
result when X is replaced by X (1). But then the computations in [6, Section 3.2] show that
the probability of obtaining a 16εM -bounded descending chain of X (1) starting in R−M ⊕ QM (o)
and consisting of more than 104ε2M 2 hops is at most

(104ε2M 2)!
By Stirling’s formula, this expression tends to 0 as M → ∞.

.

(cid:3)

We show now that under the event A′M,2 shortest-path lengths in the annulus (R−M ⊕QM (o))\

R−M are not too long.
Lemma 12. If X (1) ∈ A′M,2 and x, x′ ∈ X (1) ∩ (R−M ⊕ QM/2(o)) are such that |x − x′| ≤ 16εM ,
then x and x′ can be connected by a path in Rng(X (1)) of length at most √M .

11

Proof. Since X (1) ∈ AM , there does not exist a 16εM -bounded descending chain starting from
x and consisting of more than 104ε2M 2 hops. Hence, proceeding as in [1, Lemmas 10], we see
that x and x′ can be connected by a path in Rng(X (1)) that is contained in B106ε3M 3(x). Since
X (1) ∈ A′M , the total number of Poisson points in B106ε3M 3(x) is at most 1013ε6M 6. Using
that the maximum degree of the relative neighborhood graph is at most 6, it follows that x
and x′ can be connected by a path in Rng(X (1)) of length at most 1020ε9M 9. By the choice of
ε = ε(M ), this quantity is less than √M , provided that M is suﬃciently large.
(cid:3)
3.3. The event A′′M . The event A′′M has to encode a certain control over shortest-path lengths
on G(X).

For any P, P ′ ∈ G(X) recall that we let ℓ(P, P ′) = ℓG(X)(P, P ′) denote the Euclidean length of
the shortest path on G(X) connecting P and P ′. It is shown in [2] for the Delaunay triangulation
and in [1] for the relative neighborhood graph that there exists a deterministic value µ ∈ [1, 4/π],
called time constant, such that almost surely

µ = lim
n→∞

n−1Eℓ(o, ne1) .

If o or ne1 are not contained on G(X), then we put ℓ(o, ne1) = ℓ(q(o), q(ne1)), where q(o)
and q(ne1) denote the closest points of X to o and ne1, respectively. In the following, we put
µ− = (1 − δ′)µ and µ+ = (1 + δ′)µ, where δ′ ∈ (0, 1) is a small number that will be ﬁxed
in the proof of Lemma 14 below. First, we construct a family of events {A′′M}M≥1 such that
limM→∞ P(X (1) ∈ A′′M ) = 1 and, almost surely, if X (1) ∈ A′′M , then the following properties
are satisﬁed, where we consider the subsquares QεM (vi), i ∈ {1, . . . , KM} introduced in the
paragraph preceding Lemma 8:
(D1) if QεM (vi) ∩ QεM (vj) 6= ∅, QεM (vi) ∩ (R−M ⊕ Q16εM (o)) = ∅ and QεM (vj) ∩ (R−M ⊕
(D2) if r ≥ M and P, P ′ ∈ G(X (1)) ∩ Br(o) are such that |P − P ′| ≥ δr, then the following

Q16εM (o)) = ∅ then ℓG(X (1))(vi, vj) ≤ µ+|vi − vj|

properties are satisﬁed:
(a) if ([P, P ′] ⊕ Br7/8(o)) ∩ R−M = ∅, then ℓG(X (1))(P, P ′) ≤ µ+|P − P ′|,
(b) if the geodesic from P to P ′ in G(X (1)) does not hit the set R−M ⊕ Q8εM (o), then

ℓG(X (1))(P, P ′) ≥ µ−|P − P ′|,

Lemma 13. There exists a family of events {A′′M}M≥1 such that limM→∞ P(X (1) ∈ A′′M ) = 1
and for which conditions (D1) and (D2) are satisﬁed.
Proof. Suppose that we could construct a family of events {A∗M}M≥1 such that limM→∞ P(X ∈
A∗M ) = 1 and such that if X ∈ A∗M , then the following condition is satisﬁed:
(D1’) if QεM (vi)∩ QεM (vj) 6= ∅, then q(vi) and q(vj) are connected by a path γ in G(X) such
that ν1(γ) ≤ µ+|vi − vj| and γ is contained in (QεM (vi) ∪ QεM (vj)) ⊕ B3εM (o).
(D2’) for all integers n ≥ M and all P, P ′ ∈ G(X)∩ B2n(o) with |P − P ′| ≥ 1
2 δn it holds that
(a) P and P ′ can be connected by a path γ in G(X) such that ν1(γ) ≤ µ+|P − P ′|
(b) ℓG(X)(P, P ′) ≥ µ−|P − P ′|,

and γ is contained in [P, P ′] ⊕ Bn7/8/2(o).

As in [9, Lemma 8], Fubini’s theorem produces a conﬁguration ϕ ⊂ R−M such that P(ϕ∪X (1) ∈
A∗M ) ≥ P(X ∈ A∗M ). Then, we let {X (1) ∈ A′′M} denote the event that ϕ ∪ X (1) ∈ A∗M
In particular, limM→∞ P(X (1) ∈ A′′M ) = 1. Moreover, we claim that if
and X (1) ∈ A′M .
X (1) ∈ A′′M , then conditions (D1) and (D2) are satisﬁed. Regarding condition (D1) let vi
and vj be subsquare centers satisfying the desired conditions. Then, by (D1’), q(vi) and q(vj)
are connected by a path γ in G(X (1) ∪ ϕ) such that ν1(γ) ≤ µ+|vi − vj| and γ is contained in
(QεM (vi) ∪ QεM (vj)) ⊕ B3εM (o). Since we know that X (1) ∈ A′M,1, we conclude from Lemma 8
that γ is also a path in G(X (1)), so that ℓG(X (1))(vi, vj) ≤ µ+|vi − vj|. For condition (D2) we
may argue similarly. Indeed, let r ≥ M and P, P ′ ∈ G(X (1)) ∩ Br(o) be as in condition (D2).

12

If ([P, P ′] ⊕ Br7/8(o)) ∩ R−M = ∅, then, by condition (D2’) for n = ⌈r⌉, the points P, P ′ can
be connected by a path γ in G(X (1) ∪ ϕ) such that ν1(γ) ≤ µ+|P − P ′| and γ is contained in
[P, P ′] ⊕ Bn7/8/2(o). Moreover, by Lemma 8, γ is also a path in G(X (1)). Next, we assume that
the geodesic from P to P ′ in G(X (1)) does not hit the set R−M ⊕ Q8εM (o). In particular, again
using Lemma 8, we deduce that this geodesic is also a path in G(X (1) ∪ ϕ). Therefore, condition
(D2’) implies that

ℓG(X (1))(P, P ′) ≥ ℓG(X (1)∪ϕ)(P, P ′) ≥ µ−|P − P ′|.

Hence, it remains to construct the family {A∗M}M≥1 with the desired properties. Let z, z′ ∈
Zd ∩ B3n(o) be arbitrary. Then, it is shown in [8, Theorems 1 and 2] that the probability that
there exist P ∈ G(X) ∩ Q1(z) and P ′ ∈ G(X) ∩ Q1(z′) such that
(i) P and P ′ cannot be connected by a path γ in G(X) such that ν1(γ) ≤ µ+|P − P ′| and
(ii) ℓG(X)(P, P ′) < µ−|P − P ′|

γ is contained in [P, P ′] ⊕ Bn7/8/2(o), or

decays at stretched exponential speed in |z − z′|. Since the total number of z, z′ ∈ Z2 such
that Q1(z) ∩ B2n(o) 6= ∅ and Q1(z′) ∩ B2n(o) 6= ∅ grows polynomially in n, this completes the
proof.
3.4. How A′M ∩ A′′M ∩ EM implies FM . Now, we put AM = A′M ∩ A′′M ∩ EM and provide a
key deterministic argument which shows that X (1) ∈ AM implies X (1) ∈ FM .
Lemma 14. Let AM = A′M ∩ A′′M ∩ EM . Then {X (1) ∈ FM} holds almost surely under the
event {X (1) ∈ AM}.

(cid:3)

As noted in the beginning of this section, once Lemma 14 is established, the proof of Propo-

sition 4 is complete.

To prove Lemma 14, we proceed by contradiction. Hence, using Lemma 7, we assume that

there exists z ∈ 4Z × 2Z, x− ∈ X (1) ∩ (M z + H−) and x+ ∈ X (1) ∩ (M z + H +) such that

(i) n = π1(z) < 0 and [x−, x+] forms an edge in G(X (1)) that is contained in BM/2(M z),
(ii) γ = γ(nM )
exists, γ[P ] coalesces with γm and |π2(P )| ≤ δM , where P denotes the last

x+

intersection point of γ and lv
0.

Note that the reduction to the case n < 0 is a consequence of the remark after Lemma 7.

Now, we distinguish several cases. First, assume that there exists ξ ∈ [0, 1 − δ] such that γ
intersects the union of rays {−ξM}×(R\[−M, M ]) at some point P1. Without loss of generality,
we assume that π2(P1) ≥ M and that P1 is the last such intersection point. Furthermore, let
Q denote a point of γ[P ] satisfying π1(Q) = mπ2(P1) − ξM . Here, m ≥ 2 is a suﬃciently large
integer that will be ﬁxed in the course of the proof. Figure 4 provides a rough illustration. In
particular, it does not show edges crossing R−M .

In order to derive lower bounds for ℓ(nM )(P1, P ) we need to further decompose the event

A(1)
M occurs and that γ[P1] stays within the
vertical half-plane [−ξM,∞) × R. Then, we have the following lower bounds for ℓ(nM )(P1, P ).

Conversely, we put A(1,b)

Before we provide proofs of Lemmas 15–18, we show to deduce from them a contradiction.
Lemma 19. There exists m0 ≥ 1 such that for all m ≥ m0, all suﬃciently small δ, δ′ ∈ (0, 1)
and all suﬃciently large M ≥ 1 it holds that P(cid:0)A(1)

respect to ν(nM )

, so that
ℓ(−M )(P1, Q) ≥ ℓ(nM )(P1, Q) = ℓ(nM )(P1, P ) + ℓ(nM )(P, Q).

Hence, Lemmas 15, 16 and 17 give that

µ−π2(P1)(m + √2 − 1 − 18δm) ≤ µ+((m + m−1)π2(P1) + 16δmπ2(P1)),

so that

µ−(√2 − 1) ≤ m(34µ+δ + µ+ − µ−) + m−1µ+.

Since √2 > 1 this yields a contradiction if ﬁrst m ≥ 1 is chosen suﬃciently large and then
δ, δ′ ∈ (0, 1) are chosen suﬃciently small.
To show P(A(1,b)

M ) = 0, we proceed similarly. Using Lemmas 15, 16 and 18, we obtain that

which gives that

µ−((m + 1)π2(P1) − 2M +p1 + η2M ) + (1 − η)M

Now a quick computation shows that the right-hand side is bounded below by 1/4, which gives
the desired contradiction.
(cid:3)

Now, we prove Lemmas 15–18.

Proof of Lemma 15. Condition (D2) gives the upper bound ℓ(−M )(P1, Q) ≤ µ+|P1−Q|, so that
we obtain that

ℓ(−M )(P1, Q) ≤ µ+(pm2 + 1π2(P1) + |π2(Q)|)
≤ µ+(cid:0)mπ2(P1) +
m + √m2 + 1
≤ µ+((m + m−1)π2(P1) + |π2(Q)|).
Now, by uniqueness of ˆu0-geodesics in G(X (1)) with respect to ν(0)
between γu and γd. Therefore, an argument based on elementary geometry shows that

|π2(Q)| ≤ tan(4δ)mπ2(P1) +

cos(4δ) ≤ 16δmπ2(P1),

so that

ℓ(−M )(P1, Q) ≤ µ+(m + m−1)π2(P1) + 16δmµ+π2(P1),

as required.
Proof of Lemma 16. Let Q′ denote the point with coordinates (mπ2(P1) − ξM, 0). Then, con-
dition (D2) gives that

(cid:3)

ℓ(nM )(P, Q) ≥ µ−|P − Q| ≥ µ−(|Q′| − |P| − π2(Q)) ≥ µ−(mπ2(P1) − ξM − 17δmπ2(P1)),

as required.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 17. Since γ[P1] is contained in [−ξM,∞) × R, condition (D2) shows that

ℓ(nM )(P1, P ) ≥ µ−(|P1| − |P|) ≥ µ−(pπ2(P1)2 + ξ2M 2−δM ) ≥ µ−((√2−1)π2(P1)+(ξ−δ)M ),
where the last inequality follows from the observation that the function x 7→pπ2(P1)2 + x2− x
Proof of Lemma 18. Let P ′2 denote the ﬁrst point on γ[P1, P ] with π2(P ′2) = (1 + δ)M .
π2(P1) ≤ (1 + δ), we put P ′2 = P1. Now, condition (D2) allows us to conclude that

is decreasing.

If

(cid:3)

ℓ(nM )(P1, P2) ≥ µ−|P1 − P ′2| + |P ′2 − P2| ≥ µ−(π2(P1) − M − δM ) + (1 − η)M.

Similarly,

In particular, combining the lower bounds above yields

ℓ(nM )(P2, P ) ≥ µ−|P2 − P| ≥ µ−(|P2| − δM ).

ℓ(nM )(P1, P ) ≥ µ−(π2(P1) − M +pξ2 + η2M − 2δM ) + (1 − η)M

≥ µ−(π2(P1) + (ξ − 2)M +p1 + η2M − 2δM ) + (1 − η)M,

as required.

(cid:3)

Hence, in the following we may assume that γ does not hit the area [(−1 + δ)M, 0] × (R \
[−M, M ]). In particular, it crosses the union of segments [(−2− δ)M, (−1 + δ)M ]×{±M}. We
let P1 = (−ξM, π2(P1)) denote the last such intersection point and assume that π2(P1) = M .
Next, we let Q denote a point on γ[P ] satisfying π1(Q) = (m − 1)M , where m ≥ 3 will again
be a suﬃciently large integer. We refer the reader to Figure 5 for an illustration.
The proof of Lemma 14 in the current setting is similar to what we have seen above, but for the

convenience of the reader, we include some details. More precisely, putting A(2)
we derive contradictory upper and lower bounds on the shortest-path length ℓ(−M )(P1, Q).

To derive the lower bounds we introduce a further auxiliary point P2 = (π1(P2), ηM ) as last
point of γ[P1] satisfying π1(P2) = −(1 − δ)M . First, we provide lower bounds for ℓ(nM )(P1, P2)
and ℓ(nM )(P2, Q).

ℓ(nM )(P1, P2) ≥ (1 − η)M,

If we let A(2,a)

M denote the event that A(2)

M occurs and ξ ≤ 1 + 4δ, then the lower bounds
derived in Lemma 21 are suﬃcient to arrive at the desired contradiction. However, if the event

It is important to
observe that by Remark 4 this case cannot occur if G(X (1)) = Rng(X (1)), so that we may

M occurs, then a more reﬁned reasoning is necessary.

distinguish between the three cases i) |η| ≥ 1/4 ii) ξ ≥ 5/4 and iii) |η| ≤ 1/4 and ξ ≤ 5/4 to see
that the right-hand side remains bounded away from 0.

Finally, we provide the proofs of Lemmas 20–22.

Proof of Lemma 20. Choose a subsquare center vi such that π2(vi) = M + 5.5εM and |π1(vi) +
ξM| ≤ εM . Then, by Lemma 12, we obtain that ℓ(−M )(P1, P ′1) ≤ √M , where P ′1 = q(vi). Next,
choose a subsquare center vj such that π2(vj) = π2(vi) and

Then putting P3 = q(vj), condition (D1) implies that ℓ(−M )(P ′1, P3) ≤ µ+(ξ − 1 + δ + 2ε)M .
Finally, an application of (D2) results in

|π1(vj) − (−1 + δ)M| ≤ εM.

ℓ(−M )(P3, Q) ≤ µ+(pm2 + 1 + 18δ)M ≤ µ+(m + m−1 + 18δ)M,

as required.
Proof of Lemma 21. First, note that η ≤ 1 as γ does not hit the set [−(1 − δ)M, 0] × (R \
[−M, M ]). In particular,

(cid:3)

ℓ(nM )(P1, P2) ≥ (1 − η)M,

which proves the ﬁrst claim.

Second, proceeding as in Lemma 16, condition (D2) implies that

and

Hence,

ℓ(nM )(P2, P ) ≥ µ−(pη2 + 1 − 2δ)M
ℓ(nM )(P, Q) ≥ µ−(m − 1 − 18δm)M.

ℓ(nM )(P2, Q) = ℓ(nM )(P2, P ) + ℓ(nM )(P, Q) ≥ µ−(m − 1 +pη2 + 1 − 20δm)M,

as required.

(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 22. First, Corollary 10 and Remark 3 show that the ﬁrst edge in γ[P1] is one
of the diagonal edges shown in Figure 2. Hence by Corollary 10, writing P ′1 for intersection
point of this edge with the vertical line lv

−M , we arrive at

ℓ(nM )(P1, P2) ≥ ℓ(nM )(P1, P ′1) + ℓ(nM )(P ′1, P2) ≥

Since the right-hand side is at least (√2(ξ − 1) +|2− ξ − η| − 2δ)M , we conclude the proof. (cid:3)

√2(ξ − 1)M + |π2(P ′1) − π2(P2)| − δM.

4. Proof of Theorem 2

The proof of Theorem 2 follows the method developed in [4]. In order to make the paper
self-contained, we recall the main steps of the method and insist on the new parts which are
proper to the context G(X) = Del(X) or Rng(X).

To begin with, we provide an overview for the proof of Theorem 2. Let ˆu ∈ S1 be a given
direction. By isotropy, it suﬃces to prove that the expectation of χr(ˆu, 2π) tends to 0 as r tends
to inﬁnity. The proof works as well when 2π is replaced with any c > 0.

The spirit of the proof of Theorem 2 is the following. First, a uniform moment condition
reduces the proof to the convergence in probability of χr(ˆu, 2π) to 0. Thus, far away from the
origin, the radial character of the geodesics of tree Tx⋆ vanishes. In other words, when r is large,
with high probability, the shortest-path tree Tx⋆ locally looks like to a directed forest around
rˆu. This directed forest is in fact made up of all the semi-inﬁnite geodesics γx with direction
−ˆu starting from all the Poisson points x ∈ X. Let us denote this forest by F−ˆu. Henceforth,
to a semi-inﬁnite geodesic in Tx⋆ crossing the arc of Sr(o) centered at rˆu and with length 2π, it
corresponds a bi-inﬁnite geodesic in the directed forest F−ˆu. Now, Theorem 1 states that this
event should not occur.

STEP 1: A classical use of Fubini’s theorem– see [9, Lemma 6], [13, Theorem 0] or Lemma
3 above –ensures the existence with probability 1 of exactly one semi-inﬁnite geodesic, say γx,
with direction −ˆu starting from every Poisson point x ∈ X. The collection of these semi-inﬁnite

17

geodesics provides a directed forest F−ˆu. The goal of this ﬁrst step is to approximate the
shortest-path tree Tx⋆ inside the disk BL(rˆu) by the directed forest F−ˆu: see (3) below.
Let us remark that the graphs Tx⋆ and F−ˆu can be built simultaneously on the same vertex set
X. Except for the root x⋆ in Tx⋆, all their vertices are with outdegree 1. A measurable function
F is said local if there exists a deterministic real number L > 0 such that, for any z ∈ R2,
the quantities F (z,Tx⋆) and F (z,F−ˆu) are equal whenever each Poisson point x ∈ X ∩ BL(z)
admits the same outgoing vertex in Tx⋆ and F−ˆu. Our local approximation result is written
through the use of local functions: for any local function F ,

where dTV denotes the total variation distance.

lim
r→∞

dTV(cid:16)F (rˆu,Tx⋆), F (rˆu,F−ˆu)(cid:17) = 0 ,

(3)

Let F be a local function with local parameter L. Then, by translation invariance of the

directed forest F−ˆu,

dTV (F (rˆu,Tx⋆), F (rˆu,F−ˆu)) = dTV (F (rˆu,Tx⋆), F (rˆu,F−ˆu))
≤ P (F (rˆu,Tx⋆) 6= F (rˆu,F−ˆu)) .

(4)

The event F (rˆu,Tx⋆) 6= F (rˆu,F−ˆu) implies the existence of a Poisson point x in BL(rˆu) whose
outgoing vertices in Tx⋆ and F−ˆu are diﬀerent. So, by uniqueness, the geodesics γx⋆,x (in Tx⋆)
and γx (in F−ˆu) have only x in common. Hence, for ε ∈ (0; 1),

dTV (F (rˆu,Tx⋆), F (rˆu,F−ˆu)) ≤ P(cid:18)

γx⋆,x ∩ γx = {x} and x⋆ ∈ Brε(o) (cid:19) + o(1) .
∃x ∈ X ∩ BL(rˆu) such that

Thus, because of translation invariance and the identity γx⋆,x = γx,x⋆, we can bound the term
dTV(F (rˆu,Tx⋆), F (rˆu,F−ˆu)) by

P(cid:18) ∃x ∈ X ∩ BL(o), ∃x′ ∈ X ∩ Brε(−rˆu)

such that γx,x′ ∩ γx = {x}

(cid:19) + o(1) .

Figure 6. This picture represents the event appearing in (5) with ˆu = (1, 0).
Poisson points x and x′ respectively belong to the disks BL(o) and Brε(−rˆu).
The shortest-path tree Tx contains a semi-inﬁnite geodesic γx with asymptotic
direction −ˆu and a geodesic γx,x′ whose endpoint is in Brε(−rˆu). Furthermore,
γx and γx,x′ have only the vertex x in common.

Besides, we can require that the geodesics γx and γx,x′ belong to a thin cone with direction
−rˆu. For η > 0 and z ∈ R2, let C(z, η) be the cone with apex o, direction the vector z and
opening angle η: C(z, η) = {z′ ∈ R2, θ(z, z′) ≤ η} where θ(z, z′) is the absolute value of the
angle (in [0; π]) between vectors z and z′. On the one hand, the semi-inﬁnite geodesic γx has
asymptotic direction −ˆu. So, with high probability, for any η > 0 and M large enough, its
restriction to the outside of the disk BM (o) is included in the cone C(−ˆu, η). See [4, Lemma
13] for details. On the other hand, the same statement holds for the geodesic γx,x′ using the
moderate deviations result [8, Theorem 2]. See [4, Lemma 14] for details. Consequently, for

18

any η > 0 and M, r large enough, the term dTV(F (rˆu,Tx⋆), F (o,F−ˆu)) is bounded by

P


∃x ∈ X ∩ BL(o), ∃x′ ∈ X ∩ Brε(−rˆu)

(γx,x′ ∪ γx) ∩ BM (o)c ⊂ C(−ˆu, η) 

such that γx,x′ ∩ γx = {x} and

 + o(1) .

(6)

On the event described in (6), the shortest-path tree Tx contains two disjoint (except the root
x) geodesics with direction −ˆu which are as long as we want. However, with probability 1, Tx
contains at most one semi-inﬁnite geodesic with (deterministic) asymptotic direction −ˆu. So
(6) is a o(1) which leads to (3).

STEP 2: The goal of this second step is to state that the directed forest F−ˆu does not contain
any bi-inﬁnite geodesic with probability 1. This is a consequence of coalescence of semi-inﬁnite
geodesics (i.e. Theorem 1).

Let ˆv ∈ S1 be orthogonal to ˆu. Let ℓ be the line spanned by the vector ˆv and, for any m > 0,

let ℓm = ℓ − mˆu. For x < y, we also denote by ℓm(x, y) the subset of ℓm deﬁned by

ℓm(x, y) = {−mˆu + bˆv ∈ R2; x ≤ b < y} .

Thus, we denote by K[ℓ0(x, y)] the number of elements P ∈ ℓ0(x, y) which are deﬁned as the
last intersection point between a bi-inﬁnite geodesic of the directed forest F−ˆu and the line ℓ0.
In the same way, we denote by K[ℓ0(x, y), ℓm] the number of elements P ∈ ℓm which are deﬁned
as the last intersection point between a bi-inﬁnite geodesic γ of F−ˆu and the line ℓm, and whose
the last intersection point between γ and ℓ0 belongs to ℓ0(x, y).

ℓm

−ˆu

Figure 7. The thick segment on the line ℓ0 represents ℓ0(x, y). The two
black points on ℓm are elements counted by K[ℓ0(x, y), ℓm]. On this picture,
K[ℓ0(x, y), ℓm] equals 2 whereas K[ℓ0(x, y)] equals 3: two bi-inﬁnite geodesics
counted by K[ℓ0(x, y)] merge before the line ℓm.

However only the inequality K[ℓ0(0, L)] ≥ K[ℓ0(0, L), ℓm] holds a.s. (see Figure 7), by sta-

tionarity of the directed forest F−ˆu, it is possible to prove the identity

EK[ℓ0(0, L)] = EK[ℓ0(0, L), ℓm]

(7)

for any integers L, m > 0. See [4, Section 6] for details. Now, thanks to the coalescence of the
semi-inﬁnite geodesics of F−ˆu, the non-increasing sequence (K[ℓ0(0, L), ℓm])m≥0 a.s. converges
to a limit smaller than 1. By the Lebesgue’s Dominated Convergence Theorem, we get for any
integer L > 0:

LEK[ℓ0(0, 1)] = EK[ℓ0(0, L)] = lim
m→∞

19

EK[ℓ0(0, L), ℓm] ≤ 1 .

This forces EK[ℓ0(0, 1)] to be null. So, a.s. there is no bi-inﬁnite geodesic crossing the vertical
segment ℓ0(0, 1). We conclude by stationarity.

STEP 3: This third step consists in combining the results of the two previous ones in order

to establish the convergence in probability of χr(ˆu, 2π) to 0.

Let a(r) be the arc of the circle Sr(o) centered at rˆu and with length 2π. When r is large,
a(r) becomes close (for the Hausdorﬀ distance) to the segment I(r) centered at rˆu and with
length 2π which is orthogonal to ˆu. With high probability, the event χr(ˆu, 2π) ≥ 1 implies the
existence of a geodesic in the shortest-path tree Tx⋆ crossing I(r) and exiting the disk BR(rˆu),
for any R– when one walks away from the root x⋆. Precisely, for any R > 0, P(χr(ˆu, 2π) ≥ 1)
is smaller than

P


∃x1, x2, x3 ∈ X such that

γx1,x3 = γx1,x2 ∪ {(x2, x3)} , x3 ∈ B2R(rˆu) \ BR(rˆu) 

γx1,x2 ∩ I(r) 6= ∅ , γx1,x2 ⊂ BR(rˆu) ,

 + o(1) ,

as r tends to inﬁnity. This latter inequality relies on the fact that, with high probability when
R tends to inﬁnity, the graph G(X) contains no edge whose endpoints respectively belong to
BR(rˆu) and the outside of B2R(rˆu). In both cases G(X) = Rng(X) or G(X) = Del(X), this
would imply the existence of a random disk avoiding the Poisson point process X, overlapping
BR(rˆu) and with diameter larger than R. Let κ = ⌊6π⌋ + 1. There exists a deterministic
sequence u1, . . . , uκ of points of the circle S3R/2(rˆu) such that |ui − ui+1| ≤ R/2 for i = 1, . . . , κ
(where the index i is taken modulo κ). Then, at least one of the deterministic disks BR/2(ui)
would avoid the Poisson point process X. Such an event should not occur with high probability
as R tend to inﬁnity (uniformly in r).

Since the geodesic γx1,x3 is included in B2R(rˆu) then the event written in (8) can be described
using a local function with local parameter 2R. So, we can apply the result of Step 1. Let I(0)
be the segment centered at the origin o and with length 2π which is orthogonal to ˆu. For any
R > 0, the probability P(χr(ˆu, 2π) ≥ 1) is bounded by

(8)

whose semi-inﬁnite geodesic γx in F−ˆu

∃x ∈ X with x /∈ BR(o)

P


as r tends to inﬁnity. Now, thanks to Step 2, there is no bi-inﬁnite geodesic in the directed forest
F−ˆu with probability 1. So we can choose the radius R large enough so that the probability in
(9) is as small as we want.

STEP 4: It then remains to state the following uniform moment condition to strengthen

the convergence of χr(ˆu, 2π) to 0 in the L1 sense:

∃r0 > 0, sup
r≥r0

Eχr(ˆu, 2π)2 < ∞ .

(10)

See [4, Section 3.1] for details. Let ψr be the number of edges of the shortest-path tree Tx⋆
crossing the arc a(r). Of course, χr(ˆu, 2π) is smaller than ψr and it suﬃces– to get (10) –to
prove that P(ψr > n) decreases fast enough and uniformly on r.

First, the number of Poisson points inside the disk BR(rˆu) is controlled by [16, Lemma 11.1.1]:

for any n, r, R,

P(#(X ∩ BR(rˆu)) > n) ≤ e−n ln(cid:16) n

eπR2 (cid:17) .

(11)

[Note that (11) can also be obtained from Stirling’s formula when R and n are large.] From
now on, we assume that there are no more than n Poisson points inside BR(rˆu). Since, the tree
Tx⋆ admits more than n edges crossing the arc a(r), i.e. ψr > n, then necessarily one of these
edges has (at least) one of its endpoints outside BR(rˆu). In both cases G(X) = Rng(X) or
G(X) = Del(X), this implies the existence of a random disk avoiding the Poisson point process
X, overlapping the arc a(r) and with diameter larger than R − 2π. It is not diﬃcult to prove

20

that the probability of such an event decreases exponentially fast with R and uniformly on r
and ˆu. That is to say there exist positive constants c, c′ such that for R large enough,

The searched result follows from (11) and (12) by taking for example R = n1/4.

P(#(X ∩ BR(rˆu)) ≤ n , ψr > n) ≤ ce−c′R .
