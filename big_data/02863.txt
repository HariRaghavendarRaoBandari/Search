Abstract

This paper deals with Low-Density Construction-A (LDA) lattices, which are obtained via
Construction A from non-binary Low-Density Parity-Check codes. More precisely, a proof is pro-
vided that Voronoi constellations of LDA lattices achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel under
lattice encoding and decoding. This is obtained after showing the same result for more general
Construction-A lattice constellations. The theoretical analysis is carried out in a way that allows
to describe how the prime number underlying Construction A behaves as a function of the lattice
dimension. Moreover, no dithering is required in the transmission scheme, simplifying some previous
solutions of the problem. Remarkably, capacity is achievable with LDA lattice codes whose parity-
check matrices have constant row and column Hamming weights. Some expansion properties of
random bipartite graphs constitute an extremely important tool for dealing with sparse matrices and
allow to ﬁnd a lower bound of the minimum Euclidean distance of LDA lattices in our ensemble.

information with lattices over the AWGN channel with satisfactory performance is due to de
Buda and dates back to 1975 [7]. He showed how lattice codes whose shaping region is a ball
2 log2(SNR) under lattice decoding. This
can be reliably decoded at any asymptotic rate up to 1
decoding strategy does not take into account the shaping region that deﬁnes the constellation.
In other words, a lattice decoder simply returns the lattice point closest to the decoder input,
regardless of whether it belongs to the constellation or not. As a consequence, the decoding
decision regions are all equivalent and coincide with the Voronoi regions of the lattice points.
Of course, this method is suboptimal with respect to the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder.
Nevertheless, its easier algorithmic nature makes it appealing for both theoretical analysis
and practical implementation.

The work by de Buda continued [8] and was partially corrected by Linder, Schlegel and
Zeger [25]. They were able to prove that lattice codes can attain the capacity of the AWGN
channel under optimal decoding, with shaping determined by “thin” spherical shells. This
peculiar shaping region actually makes the code lose most of its lattice structure and look
similar to a random code on a sphere. Urbanke and Rimoldi [40] completed this work with
the proof that lattice codes made up of the intersection between a ball and a lattice are
capacity-achieving under optimal nearest-codeword decoding.

Thus, it was shown that lattice codes are capacity-achieving. Nonetheless, the question of
whether this result can be obtained under (a priori non-optimal) lattice decoding remained
2 log2(SNR) with
answerless. In 1997, Loeliger [27] proved the achievability of the rate 1
Construction-A lattices over non-binary alphabets and conjectured that this limit could not
be overcome with lattice decoding. It has been necessary to wait for Erez and Zamir’s
solution to the problem [17], based on the Modulo-Lattice Additive Noise (MLAN) channel
and Voronoi constellations with Construction-A lattices. More recently, Belﬁore and Ling
[26] proposed a solution that involves an inﬁnite (but energetically ﬁnite) codebook.

Once the theoretical problem of non-constructively achieving capacity with ML decoding
was solved, it left the place also to the challenge of designing some constructive families of
lattices adapted to iterative decoding with close-to-capacity performance. The intention was,
and still is, to translate into concrete evidence the theoretical effort of showing that lattices
are adequately suited to block coding in high dimensions for the AWGN channel. Most of
the proposed families are inspired by LDPC and turbo codes [1], [34]–[37], [39] and an
interesting work on lattices based on polar codes exists [43]–[45]; the latter are also shown
to be capacity-achieving.

The authors of this paper have contributed to this ﬁeld with the introduction of two lattice

families: the most recent are the Generalized Low-Density (GLD) lattices [3], [4]. They
show great performance under iterative decoding and numerical simulations have been run in
remarkably high dimensions (up to one million). Moreover, a theoretical analysis about the
possibility of achieving the so called Poltyrev capacity with inﬁnite GLD-lattice constellations
is provided in [13].

The second family consists of Low-Density Construction-A (LDA) lattices, to which this
paper is entirely devoted. LDA lattices put together the strength of Construction A [24]
and LDPC codes (over a non-binary prime ﬁeld) [21]. Their main feature is that their
corresponding parity-check matrix is sparse. As one can guess, this is the key idea to redirect
their decoding to well-performing, implementable LDPC decoding algorithms. LDA lattices
were ﬁrst envisaged in [16] and were referred to with this name and reintroduced by di
Pietro et al. [9], together with an efﬁcient iterative algorithm to decode them. A theoretical
analysis of the Poltyrev-capacity-achieving qualities of inﬁnite LDA constellations was carried
out by the same authors [10], [11], whereas the “goodness” properties of LDA lattices are
studied in [41], [42]. The problem of attaining the real capacity of the AWGN channel with
ﬁnite LDA constellations was addressed and a solution was developed in the ﬁrst author’s
dissertation [12]. The main purpose of this work is to give a detailed account of this solution:
improvements will also be provided along the way.

A. Original contributions and main features of this paper

Defoliated of all technical hypotheses, our main accomplishment can be stated as follows:

Theorem 1. For every SNR > 1, there exists a random ensemble of LDA lattices that achieves
capacity of the AWGN channel under lattice encoding and decoding.

One may question the point of proving this kind of result for lattices that are designed for
iterative decoding in high dimensions, knowing well that it will be impractical to implement
a lattice decoder. Historically, lattice decoding has been considered conceptually simpler than
ML decoding for constellations of points in Rn with little structure, and therefore as a possible
intermediate step towards polynomial-time and more practical decoding algorithms. For us,
knowing that the LDA family has the potential to reach capacity justiﬁes and encourages
further research into the design and study of practical iterative techniques for this family of
lattices or some of its subfamilies.

The more precise version of Theorem 1 is Theorem 3 of Section XII-D and all the other
results of this dissertation are intermediate steps to reach its proof. The most relevant of

these is Theorem 2 of Section VIII-D, which is the analogue of Theorem 1 or 3 for more
general, non-LDA Construction-A ﬁnite lattice constellations. The capacity of the AWGN
channel was previously shown to be achievable by lattice decoding of lattice code ensembles
by Erez and Zamir [17], Ordentlich and Erez [30], Ling and Belﬁore [26], and recently for
polar decoding by Yan et al. [45]. The additional insight provided by our proof techniques
includes the following:

• We are able to prove the capacity-achieving properties of Construction-A lattices without
using the theoretical tool of the MLAN channel [17], [30]; in particular, we do not assume
that the sender and the receiver share the common randomness known as dither, even if
we apply Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimation of the channel output. This
solves a problem raised by Forney [20] who points out that in this context avoiding the
use of a dither has to be possible, but no proof had ever been provided, to the best of
our knowledge.

• We still rely on Voronoi lattice constellations and do not need to introduce Gaussian

coding [26], [45].

• We follow the work of [17] and [30] in that we use Construction A together with
randomly chosen p-ary codes. As before, p has to be a growing function of the lattice
dimension n: however, we are able to reduce its growth rate.

• Last, but not least, this proof technique adapts to the case of LDA lattices, whereas how

to adapt previous proofs to the LDA case is to us very much unclear.

Among the main aspects that characterise our work, it is important to remark that the row
and column Hamming weights of the parity-check matrices of the non-binary LDPC codes
that underlie our construction are reasonably small constants and do not need to tend to
inﬁnity with the lattice dimension. This is an appreciable feature, because the complexity of
the LDA decoding algorithm is directly proportional to those numbers. The minimum value
of the constant row weight as a function of the parameters of the construction is explicitly
given in Theorem 3 (compare also with [11]). Notice that for binary LDPC codes to achieve
the capacity of any memoryless binary symmetric channel or of the binary erasure channel,
asymptotically inﬁnite row weights are mandatorily required [21], [28], [38]. Some graph-
based, capacity-achieving binary codes with bounded decoding complexity in spite of their
unbounded maximum row weight are instead Pﬁster et al.’s IRA codes [31].

Our LDA ensemble is based on random bipartite graphs. These graphs are known to have
some particular expansion properties that, qualitatively speaking, say that all “small enough”

sets of nodes have “large enough” neighborhoods. We exploit intensively these properties,
formally made explicit in Lemma 9 and Corollary 1 of Section IX; they turn out to be two of
the most important theoretical pillars of our analysis. Lemma 10 and Corollary 2 of Section
XI consist of a lower-bound of the minimum Euclidean distance and fundamental gain of
our LDA ensemble and are an example of how expansion properties are used in our setting.
As a ﬁnal comment, notice that our capacity-achieving result for LDA lattices does not
hold for SNR ≤ 1. Nevertheless, this is not a very constraining restriction: for very small
SNR there is no need for using lattice constellations for communications over the AWGN
channel and classical coded binary modulations are already known to work in a more than
satisfactory way [33].

B. Structure of the paper

Our paper is structured as follows: Section II contains a list of deﬁnitions about lattices
and lattice constellations. In Section III, we state four useful lemmas, which will be often
employed in the following. Section IV recalls the main features of Theorem 2, which shows
how and under what conditions random Construction-A lattice constellations achieve the
capacity of the AWGN channel. Section V and Section VI provide a formal deﬁnition of
those constellations and of the information transmission scheme that we consider. In Section
VII, we give a general description of the main ideas that lead to the proof of Theorem 2 and
Theorem 3. The complete detailed proof of Theorem 2 is provided in Section VIII. Section
IX is an independent section which presents the expansion properties of bipartite graphs.
Section X is an introduction to the LDA setting, to which the second part of the paper is
entirely devoted. Our random LDA-lattice constellations are presented in Section XI, which
contains also a result on the minimum distance of their underlying LDPC codes and Hermite
constants. The detailed proof of Theorem 3 on the capacity-achieving properties of LDA
lattices is provided in Section XII. Section XIII recalls the main results of this paper and
contains some concluding remarks. Finally, the appendices contain the proofs of most of the
lemmas which are not treated in detail in the other sections.

C. Notation

Throughout the whole paper we will very often use asymptotic relations between functions
of the lattice dimension n. As usual, the symbol ∼ indicates the “asymptotic equality”:
f (n) ∼ g(n) if limn→∞ f (n)/g(n) = 1. The notation f (n) (cid:46) g(n) indicates that f (n) ∼
s(n) ≤ g(n) for some s(n); or, equivalently, that f (n) ≤ t(n) ∼ g(n), for some t(n). With

analogous meaning, we can write g(n) (cid:38) f (n). The symbols o(·) and O(·) refer to the
standard Bachmann-Landau notation in the variable n.

We say that a function f (n) grows subexponentially fast in n if f (n) = O(exp(nβ)) for

some 0 < β < 1. Observe that nnγ is subexponential for every 0 < γ < 1.

We will very often deal with balls and spheres and we will denote Bc,n(ρ) ⊆ Rn the

n-dimensional ball centered at c with radius ρ.

A crucial parameter of our analysis is the prime number p that underlies Construction A
(cf. Deﬁnition 6). It needs to tend to inﬁnity when the lattice dimension n grows and we
are interested in describing the growth of p as a function of n. For this reason, p is deﬁned
as p = nλ for some positive constant λ. It is clear that if n changes and λ is ﬁxed, then in
general nλ is not a prime number. It would be more precise to say that p(λ) is the closest
prime number to nλ, or that p = nλ(n) for some λ(n) assuming values in an interval properly
centered at our ﬁxed value λ. Nevertheless, it is possible to show that this variation of λ(n)
concerns a range which is narrow enough not to impact any of the asymptotic estimations
that we compute letting n tend to inﬁnity. In other words, there always exists a prime number
p close enough to nλ to make accurate the approximation p = nλ (for example, we can apply
Bertrand’s Postulate [15]). Despite the slight abuse of notation, we prefer to keep it that
way from now on, in order to write the proofs in the clearest way possible and avoid the
overabundance of symbols.

II. LATTICES AND LATTICE CODES FOR THE AWGN CHANNEL

We assume that the reader is already familiar with lattices as mathematical objects and
constellations for the transmission of information; excellent references are [6], [14], [46]. We
recall here some deﬁnitions that we will need in the following, mainly with the purpose of
ﬁxing our notation.

In this paper we exclusively deal with real lattices, i.e., discrete additive subgroups of the
Euclidean vector space Rn. They are always full-rank and the letter n indicates the lattice
rank and the dimension of the Euclidean space as well.

Deﬁnition 1 (Voronoi region). We call Voronoi region of a lattice point x ∈ Λ the set

V(x) = {y ∈ Rn : (cid:107)y − x(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)y − z(cid:107), ∀z ∈ Λ (cid:114) {x}}.

We call Voronoi region of the lattice, and denote it V(Λ), the Voronoi region of 0.

Deﬁnition 2 (Effective radius). The effective radius of a lattice Λ is the radius of the ball
whose volume is equal to the volume of V(Λ).

Deﬁnition 3 (Volume of a lattice). The volume of a lattice Λ is deﬁned as

Vol(Λ) = Vol (V(Λ)) .

Deﬁnition 4 (Minimum Euclidean distance and fundamental gain). The minimum Euclidean
distance of a lattice Λ ⊆ Rn is deﬁned as

dEmin(Λ) = min
x,y∈Λ
x(cid:54)=y

(cid:107)x − y(cid:107) = min
x∈Λ(cid:114){0}

(cid:107)x(cid:107).

The fundamental gain of Λ is

dEmin(Λ)2
Vol(Λ) 2
It is also known as the Hermite constant of the lattice.

γ(Λ) =

.

n

(1)

Deﬁnition 5 (Voronoi constellation). Consider two lattices Λ and Λf; we say that they are
nested if Λ ⊆ Λf. We call Voronoi constellation [5], [19] of two nested lattices the lattice
code

C = Λf ∩ V(Λ).

In this context, Λ is often called the shaping lattice and Λf the ﬁne lattice.

We can deduce from the previous deﬁnition that the Voronoi constellation has cardinality
Vol(Λ)/ Vol(Λf ) and its elements are the representatives of the congruence classes of Λf /Λ
with minimum norm. More precisely, if some points of Λf lie exactly on the boundary of
V(Λ), we are implicitely assuming that only one of them is taken for each congruence class.
Equivalently, we can modify the deﬁnition of the Voronoi region to design its boundary in
such a way that the lattice code consists precisely of one representative for each congruence
class.

Deﬁnition 6 (Construction A [24]). Let C = C[n, k]p be a p-ary linear code of length n
p (cid:44)→ {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}n. We say that the
and dimension k and let us embed C into Zn via Fn
lattice Λ ⊆ Rn is built with Construction A from C when

Λ = C + pZn = {x ∈ Rn : x = c + pz, ∃c ∈ C, z ∈ Zn} ⊆ Zn.

If H is a parity-check matrix of C, we call it also the parity-check matrix of Λ = C + pZn,
because

Λ = {x ∈ Zn : HxT ≡ 0T mod p}.

TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL., NO., MONTH YEAR

Notice that the deﬁnition of Construction A could be made more general [6], but we stick

here to the one that will give rise to our lattice code ensembles in the following sections.

Deﬁnition 7 (Capacity-achieving family). Let C be the capacity of our channel. We say that
a family of lattice codes is capacity-achieving under some decoding procedure if for every
δ > 0 and for every ε > 0 there exists a lattice code in the family with rate at least C − δ
and decoding error probability at most ε.

Deﬁnition 8 (Wiener coefﬁcient). Let x be the random variable that represents the AWGN
channel input and let y = x + w be its random output, then the Wiener coefﬁcient [22,
Chap. 2] is

α = arg min
β∈R

E[(cid:107)x − βy(cid:107)2].

The minimum in the previous formula is usually called Minimum Mean Squared Error and
the Wiener coefﬁcient is also called MMSE coefﬁcient.

It is well known that, if E[(cid:107)x(cid:107)2] = nP and wi ∼ N (0, σ2) for every i, then [12, Lemma 4.1]

α =

P

P + σ2 .

Deﬁnition 9 (Lattice quantizer). We denote QΛ(·) the quantizer of a lattice Λ associated with
V(Λ):

QΛ(y) = arg min
x∈Λ

(cid:107)y − x(cid:107).

Notice that the quantizer is a priori not deﬁned for the points of the boundary of V(Λ);
this will never be a problem for us, basically because those points belong to a region of the
space of measure 0. If needed, the previous deﬁnition can be made more formal with little
effort to avoid any kind of ambiguity.

Deﬁnition 10 (MMSE lattice decoder). Let x be the AWGN channel input and y its random
output. We call MMSE lattice decoder the decoder that proposes the point ˆx = QΛ(αy) as
the channel input guess, where α is the Wiener coefﬁcient.

Notice that multiplication by α is essential for achieving capacity with a lattice decoder,
as it was for Erez and Zamir [17], [20]. We will give a geometrical explanation of this in
Section VII-A.

III. SOME USEFUL LEMMAS

This section contains some lemmas that deal with probability theory, combinatorics and
geometry. They are quite classical and will be often applied in the sequel, sometimes even
implicitly, when the context will be clear enough. The ﬁrst one describes the “typical” norm of
a random additive white Gaussian noise vector in very high dimension. For constant standard
deviation σ, the statement is simply the weak law of large numbers; in Appendix A we give
a proof that works also for σ = σ(n).

IV. RANDOM CONSTRUCTION-A LATTICES ACHIEVE CAPACITY

The ﬁrst main result of this paper is Theorem 2 of Section VIII-D, which consists of a new
proof that there exists a random ensemble of Construction-A lattices that achieves capacity
under MMSE lattice decoding when SNR > 1. Our work preserves the main advantages of
the already known results on Construction-A lattices, while overcoming some of their less
attractive aspects. The main features of our proof are:

• Our family is similar to the one proposed by Ordentlich and Erez [30], but our approach
is dual with respect to theirs: our Construction-A ensemble is deﬁned via a set of parity-
check matrices (cf. Section V), whereas they employ generator matrices.

• We still adopt the technique of Voronoi constellations for shaping.
• We do not need dithering anymore. This meets the purpose of Ling and Belﬁore [26]
of avoiding the unpractical sharing of common randomness between the sender and
the receiver. However, they pay the price of a non-constructive encoder. Our proof
instead does not need lattice Gaussian distribution and we still have an a priori uniform
distribution over the lattice constellation. Moreover, an explicit bijection exists that maps
messages to constellation points (cf. (5)). This is desirable when we think of practical
implementations of our encoding and decoding scheme. Our transmission scheme is
summarized in Fig. 1 and treated in detail in Section VI.

• We still rely on the idea of scaling the AWGN channel output by the Wiener coefﬁcient,

before performing lattice decoding. This enhances the strength of the decoder.

• We restrict our construction to the case SNR > 1. The reasons of this choice will be

explained in Section VII-A.

• With respect to Ordentlich and Erez’s construction, we decrease the size of the prime
number needed for Construction A as a function of n, still attaining capacity (recall that
they have p ≈ n3/2). Again, this has practical advantages.

Most of the previously listed features will concern Theorem 3, too. Sections from IV to
IX, although they are self-contained and relevant on their own, can be also considered as
an essential and detailed introduction to the proof of Theorem 3, which restricts the random
Construction-A ensemble to a Low-Density Construction-A (LDA) ensemble. Presenting ﬁrst
Theorem 2 allows the reader to understand the strategy and the tools required to show how
capacity is achieved independently from the problems that arise from other less general
constructions. Consequently, when moving to the proof of Theorem 3, we will be able to
focus more on those technicalities that strictly belong to the low-density structure associated

V. THE RANDOM CONSTRUCTION-A ENSEMBLE

Our random Construction-A ensemble is simply given by a random parity-check matrix,
whose entries are independent random variables uniformly distributed over {0, 1, . . . , p−1} (cid:39)
Fp. In particular, let H be this matrix, of dimension n(1 − R) × n for some 0 < R < 1 and
let Hf be its lower submatrix formed by the last n(1− Rf ) rows of H for some R < Rf < 1:

 H(cid:48)

Hf

 .

H =

(3)

The submatrix Hf deﬁnes a linear code Cf over Fp and the whole matrix H deﬁnes a subcode
C of Cf. The two lattices Λ and Λf, obtained with Construction A respectively from C and
Cf are nested:

Λ = {x ∈ Zn : HxT ≡ 0T mod p} ⊆ {x ∈ Zn : Hf xT ≡ 0T mod p} = Λf .

The Voronoi constellation that we consider is then given by Λf ∩ V(Λ) (see Deﬁnition 5).
If we suppose that all the rows of H are linearly independent, then R and Rf are the real
rates of the codes C and Cf respectively. It is known that

Vol(Λ) = pn(1−R) and Vol(Λf ) = pn(1−Rf ),

from which we deduce that the cardinality M of the lattice constellation is

M = |Λf /Λ| =

Vol(Λ)
Vol(Λf )

= pn(Rf−R).

Notice that the probability that the rank of H is strictly smaller than n(1− R) can be shown
to decrease to 0 very fast when n tends to inﬁnity; hence we will work as if H always had
full rank.

VI. ENCODING AND DECODING

The points of the constellation (or equivalently the cosets of Λf /Λ) are indexed by the
pn(Rf−R) different syndromes of the form (s1, s2, . . . , sn(Rf−R), 0, . . . , 0) associated with the
matrix H, where all the si ∈ Fp. More explicitly, let (cid:96) = n(Rf − R) and let F(cid:96)
p be (in 1-1
correspondence with) the set of the messages; the bijection

ϕ : Λf ∩ V(Λ) → F(cid:96)
x (cid:55)→ H(cid:48)xT mod p

p

(5)

makes a constructive encoding possible (recall that H(cid:48) is the upper submatrix of H). Our
transmission scheme works as follows:

1) The sender pairs up a message and a syndrome and transmits x, the corresponding

constellation point obtained via ϕ−1, over the AWGN channel.

2) The receiver gets the channel output y = x + w and multiplies it by the Wiener

coefﬁcient α.

3) Then, he performs lattice decoding of αy and gets ˆx = QΛf (αy).
4) The decoded message will be the one associated with ϕ(ˆx).

A ﬁnal remark on the bijection ϕ: for every s(cid:48) ∈ F(cid:96)

and the encoding operation can be substantially performed thanks to a lattice decoder, too.

VII. HOW TO ACHIEVE CAPACITY - OVERVIEW AND DISCUSSION ON OUR PROOF

We will now give a general description of our proof, by the means of a heuristic argument
that does not take into account all the probabilistic and asymptotic aspects of the rigorous
demonstration.

A. Geometric description

Our result is based on the following facts:

• The points of the constellation typically have the same norm and lie very close to the

surface of a sphere of a given radius (cf. Lemma 6).

DRAFT

13

• The AWG noise is typically almost orthogonal to the sent vector, in the sense that, if x
is our transmitted constellation point and w is the noise, then the scalar product xwT
has a “small enough” absolute value (cf. Lemma 7).

• The effective noise due to MMSE scaling and the sent point are not decorrelated.
Consequently, it is not possible to show that MMSE lattice decoding works with very
high probability independently of the sent point. Nevertheless, Theorem 2 is based on
the fact that the number of points for which this does not happen is not big enough to
perturb the average error probability of the family.

• For a certain MMSE-scaled channel output, we look for lattice points inside a sphere
centered at it and with a typical radius to be speciﬁed later. Basically, there will be no
decoding error if the only lattice point in this decoding sphere is the transmitted one. In
a few particular cases, we will need to show explicitly that even if there is more than
one lattice point in the decoding sphere, the decoder output will still be the channel
input.

√

Consider that when we use the adverb “typically”, we mean “with probability tending to
1 when n tends to inﬁnity”. The accurate proof will be treated in all detail in the sequel,
but let us try to understand the geometric sense of the elements that we have just listed. So,
suppose that the channel input is a point x whose norm is ﬁxed to be (cid:107)x(cid:107) =
nP , for some
P > 0, which will turn out to be the average (and asymptotically maximum) power of the
constellation. Suppose also that xwT = 0 (this is a stronger hypothesis than the statement
of Lemma 7, but it helps to understand the more general scenario); if y = x + w is the
channel output, then (cid:107)y(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 +(cid:107)w(cid:107)2. Now, let us multiply y by the scalar value α that
minimizes the distance between x and αy. If σ2 is the AWG noise variance per dimension,
basic Euclidean geometry (see Fig. 2) tells us that if (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 = nσ2, then α = P/(σ2 + P ) is
precisely the Wiener coefﬁcient. This lets us guess that MMSE scaling helps in bringing the
decoder input closer to the sent point.

The receiver passes αy to the lattice decoder and there will be no decoding error if there
is no other lattice point closer to αy than x. We will show that this typically happens when

1) SNR > 1.
2) P ≈ p2(1−R)/2πe;
3) (cid:107)αy − x(cid:107)2 < np2(1−Rf )/2πe.

Figure 2. Geometric interpretation: x is the transmitted constellation point; (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 = nP . The AWG noise vector is w,
with (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 = nσ2. The AWGN channel output is y = x + w. The Wiener coefﬁcient is α = P
P +σ2 and αy is the lattice
decoder input. h is the effective noise corresponding to MMSE scaling.

Notice that the latter bound concretely means that our constellation tolerates an “effective”
noise after MMSE scaling whose variance per dimension is less than

σ2
Pol =

p2(1−Rf )

2πe

.

This value is far from being fortuitous: it is precisely the so called Poltyrev limit or Poltyrev
capacity of the random inﬁnite constellation Λf [12, Deﬁnition 2.19], [27], [32]. We intu-
itively understand that this is the good condition on the maximum bearable noise, admitting
that no problem comes from the fact that the “effective” noise and the sent point x are not
decorrelated (incidentally, this would be the case if we used dithering).

The condition on the signal-to-noise ratio can be simply understood with the following
argument: let us call h = αy − x and suppose that it takes the maximum value according
to the third condition above here, (cid:107)h(cid:107)2 = np2(1−Rf )/2πe = nσ2
dec. We drop the index “Pol”
and use “dec” instead, to indicate that the quantity corresponds to the (upper bound of the)
reliably decodable effective noise and to the decoding sphere deﬁned in the proof of Theorem
2. If we want good decoding, we need αy to be closer to x than to 0, because the latter
deterministically belongs to any Voronoi constellation; in other terms, it is necessary that
(cid:107)αy(cid:107)2 > (cid:107)h(cid:107)2. Again, a Euclidean geometry argument based on Fig. 2 shows that (always

that is P > σ2 or, equivalently, SNR > 1. This gives a ﬁrst explanation why we do not treat
the case SNR ≤ 1.

Taking (cid:107)h(cid:107)2 = nσ2

dec corresponds to a maximum rate for the constellation that equals
capacity, as can be understood from the following calculation: from (6) we can derive that

2 log2(SNR),
This heuristically explains how we manage to gain the “plus 1” in the formula 1
which was the conjectured maximum achievable rate in this context, before the introduction
of MMSE scaling [27]. The same argument was pointed out in Erez and Zamir’s work [17].
To conclude, recall that we make the hypothesis that P ≈ p2(1−R)/2πe; this and (4) can be
used to show that the AWGN capacity is

B. Originality of our proof and lattice decoding of αy

What we have explained till now gives an intuitive description of the typical geometry
that characterises the AWG noise and the random Voronoi constellations of Construction-A
nested lattices. Nevertheless, it does not directly drop a hint on the original idea behind our
proof that allows to avoid dithering. It is worth the effort of spending some words about that
now, before moving on to the detailed proof.

The main argument is the following: if αy is the real point that the receiver passes to the
√
nσdec), which we call
lattice decoder, we ﬁx as our working environment the sphere Bαy,n(
the decoding sphere. After ensuring that the sent point x lies in it, our general strategy aims
to prove that it is the only lattice point inside the decoding sphere. This would imply that
lattice decoding does not fail, but unfortunately this does not happen for every instance of
the AWG noise and may not happen for every point of the constellation. Hence, we apply
an averaging argument that leads among other things to the estimation of (a more elaborate

version of) the following sum: (cid:88)

√
z∈Bαy,n(

nσdec)(cid:114){x}

P{z ∈ Λf | x ∈ Λf}.

Showing that this sum vanishes when n tends to inﬁnity will be our main goal. It will be
clear later that the best situation possible is when the two events {z ∈ Λf} and {x ∈ Λf} are
independent; but, in principle, they may not be, also because the multiplication by α adds
some correlation between x and the “effective” noise αy − x. One can interpret Erez and
Zamir’s dithering technique as a method of eliminating this correlation. We do not use dither
and consequently there will be a priori some x for which the probability in the previous sum
takes a “big” value, while at the same time we need to show that the whole sum is “small”.
The originality of our analysis consists of deducing that the proportion of this kind of points
in the constellation is very small and the total error decoding probability still goes to 0 when
n tends to inﬁnity (see Lemma 8 and its application to (45) in the proof of Theorem 2).

VIII. THE DETAILED PROOF

From now on, we will go into all the technical aspects of our proof that there exists a
random capacity-achieving Construction-A lattice family. This result will be formally stated
and proved in Theorem 2. For the sake of clearness, we have taken out of its proof a certain
number of lemmas, that we present below here. Except for Lemma 6, their proofs are in the
appendices, because they do not rely on coding or information-theoretical techniques.

A. The typical norm of a constellation point

We now evaluate precisely the typical norm of a constellation point. Let ρ(n)

eﬀ be the effective
radius of the n-dimensional shaping lattice Λ (see also Deﬁnition 2 and 5). It is the radius
of the ball which has the same volume as V(Λ), the Voronoi region of the shaping lattice:

We claim that for n large enough almost all the points of the constellation lie very close
to the surface of the ball B0,n(ρeﬀ). Before formally proving this, we need the following
lemma, whose proof is in Appendix C.
Lemma 5. Let B = Bc,n(ρ) and let x be any point of B ∩ Zn. If p is a prime number and
µ ∈ Fp, then

2) If x ≡ az mod p for some a ∈ Fp (cid:114) {1}, let i be an index such that si (cid:54)= 0 (there
always exists, since s (cid:54)= 0). Hence, either ahizT ≡ si mod p or hizT ≡ si mod p, with

B. A property of the Gaussian noise

The following lemma formally explains in what probabilistic, asymptotic sense the typical
AWG noise vector is almost orthogonal to constellation points (see also the comments in
Section VII-A). Explicitly, we bound their scalar product by a quantity that in the proof of
Theorem 2 turns out to be negligible with respect to their squared norms. Hence, (cid:107)x + w(cid:107)2
can be accurately enough approximated by (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 + (cid:107)w(cid:107)2. The proof of the lemma is written
in Appendix D.
Lemma 7 (Orthogonal noise). Let x ∈ Rn and let w = (w1, w2, . . . , wn) be a random AWG
noise vector with i.i.d. components: wi ∼ N (0, σ2). Then, for every function f (n) such that

D. The proof that capacity is achieved

We are now ready to state and prove the main result of this section:

Theorem 2. The random ensemble of nested Construction-A lattices introduced in Section
V achieves capacity of the AWGN channel under MMSE lattice decoding, when SNR > 1,
R > 1/2 and p = nλ for some constant λ > (1 + R)−1.

Proof: The AWGN channel is deﬁned by the SNR = P/σ2 > 1, for some AWG noise
variance per dimension σ2 and some power constraint P . The capacity is then known to be

C =

1
2

log2(1 + SNR).

Let us call M = 2nRC the cardinality of our Voronoi constellation; we would like to show
that for every ﬁxed rate RC smaller than capacity, the random ensemble of Section V
corresponding to that rate can be reliably decoded. Namely, suppose that RC = γC, for
some constant 0 < γ < 1. Then, we ﬁx the rates of the Fp-linear codes generating the nested
lattice ensemble: 1/2 < R < Rf < 1, such that the constellation C = Λf ∩ V(Λ), whose
cardinality is pn(Rf−R), has rate

log2(1 + SNR) = γC = RC =

messages are supposed to be a priori equiprobable. Let x be the random coded point

(with coordinate-wise variance σ2) and α = P/(P + σ2) = (1 + SNR−1)−1 is the Wiener
coefﬁcient, we claim that for every ε > 0,

n→∞P{(cid:107)αy − x(cid:107)2 ≤ αnσ2(1 + ε)2} = 1.

lim

If s = 0, then x = 0 and y = w. The claim is a straightforward consequence of Lemma 1
(the fact that α < 1 is also used). If instead s (cid:54)= 0, let ε(cid:48) < ε be a positive constant, let f (n)
be a function such that limn→∞ f (n) = +∞ (to be speciﬁed later) and let E1 be the event

E1 = {(cid:107)x(cid:107)2 ≤ nP (1 + ε(cid:48))2} ∩ {(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≤ nσ2(1 + ε(cid:48))2} ∩ {|xwT| ≤ f (n)σ(cid:107)x(cid:107)}.

Note that, provided that ε(cid:48) is small enough, the event E1 is (asymptotically) contained in the
event {(cid:107)αy − x(cid:107)2 ≤ αnσ2(1 + ε)2}: indeed, E1 implies

by Lemma 6, Lemma 1 and Lemma 7. Notice also that taking into account (21) and (22), a

We have just shown that with very high probability when n is big enough, the sent point x
lies inside a sphere of radius ρdec =
2πe centered at αy. We call
this sphere the decoding sphere B = Bαy,n(ρdec) and no decoding error occurs if the only
point of Λf ∩ B is x (see the related comments in Section VII-B).

√
np(1−Rf )(1− δ)(1 + ε)/

Let us call the “good decoding” event E2 = {Λf ∩ B = {x}} and E c

2 its complement. To
prove the theorem, we will show that for every syndrome s, the probability that αy is not
well decoded tends to 0 for a randomly chosen lattice constellation in the ensemble. Let us
call Pe(s) this probability and let Xs be the random variable that represents the constellation
point associated with s; Xs takes a priori a different value x ∈ Zn for every different choice
of a random constellation.

Let us start with s = 0. In this case, P{Xs = 0} = 1. To begin, we claim that for every

z ∈ pZn (cid:114) {0},

n→∞P{(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≥ (cid:107)w − z(cid:107)2} = 0.

lim

In other words, the random noise produces a channel output which is typically closer to 0
(the channel input in this case) than to any other point of pZn. From the point of view of the
lattice decoder, this means that the points of pZn do not typically induce any decoding errors.
Let us prove the claim: since z belongs to pZn, a necessary condition when (cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≥ (cid:107)w−z(cid:107)2
is that at least one of the coordinates of w is bigger than p/2 in absolute value. Hence

P{(cid:107)w(cid:107)2 ≥ (cid:107)w − z(cid:107)2} ≤ P{|wi| ≥ p/2,∃i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}}

P{|wi| ≥ p/2}.

which decreases to 0 because p = nλ.

The claim is proved and we are implicitely saying that with probability tending to 1 no
point of pZn different from 0 inside B can lead to bad decoding. Hence we will restrict our
error probability analysis only to points not belonging to pZn and, with the help of Lemma
2 and 3, we obtain

which tends to 0 because (1 − δ)(1 + ε) < 1 (notice that for every ﬁxed δ, we can choose ε
as small as needed).

Now, let us pass to the case s (cid:54)= 0. Notice that, choosing ω as in (8), Lemma 6 implies
that Xs lies inside the shaping sphere Beﬀ = B0,n(ρeﬀ(1 + 1/nω)) with probability tending

P{ decoding error | Xs (cid:54)∈ Beﬀ}P{Xs (cid:54)∈ Beﬀ}
∼ P{ decoding error | Xs ∈ Beﬀ}P{Xs ∈ Beﬀ}
= P{Xs ∈ Beﬀ, decoding error}.

For this reason, observing that no point of pZn can be the codeword associated with s, we

We will separately show that (30) and (31) tend to 0 when n tends to inﬁnity, which is
enough to conclude.

Estimation of (30). By the deﬁnition of conditional probability,

(30) =

x∈(Zn∩Beﬀ )(cid:114)pZn

P{x (cid:54)∈ B | Xs = x}P{Xs = x}.

(27) tells us that the term P{x (cid:54)∈ B | Xs = x} is a vanishing term T (n), independently of
x. Hence,

(cid:88)

(cid:88)

(30) = T (n)

n→∞

P{Xs = x,∃z ∈ Λf ∩ B and z (cid:54)= x} = 0.

(32)

Before going on, let us start by making some considerations in a number of particular
cases about the error probability, the existence of some z as in (32), and the corresponding
x:

1) First of all, does the point z = 0 ∈ Λf typically induce a decoding error? Actually not,

since we claim that

n→∞P{(cid:107)αy(cid:107)2 > αnσ2(1 + ε)2} = 1.

lim

27

This and (25) mean that, given any non-zero point x of the constellation,

n→∞P{(cid:107)αy − x(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:107)αy(cid:107)2} = 1.

lim

Thus, x is asymptotically closer to αy than 0 and the lattice decoder cannot give 0
as an output. Now, let us prove the claim: the condition (cid:107)αy(cid:107)2 > αnσ2(1 + ε)2 is
equivalent to

(cid:107)y(cid:107)2 >

SNR

< n(P + σ2)(1 − ε(cid:48))2,

which is true because SNR is bigger than 1 by hypothesis and (1 + ε)2/(1 − ε(cid:48))2 can
be taken to be as close to 1 as wanted, then a fortiori smaller than SNR.

2) The previous argument states that 0 asymptotically almost never causes a decoding
error. We would like to treat now the case of all the other points z ∈ pZn. Notice that
one of these points can be the lattice decoder output only if it is closer to αy than
0 itself. That is, dangerous points z ∈ pZn (cid:114) {0} are such that (cid:107)αy − z(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)αy(cid:107).
This implies that there exists i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} such that |αyi − zi| ≤ |αyi| and zi (cid:54)= 0;
moreover, the fact that z ∈ pZn means that |zi| ≥ p. Consequently, |αyi| has to be
bigger than p/2 and, a fortiori, |yi| > p/2, too, because α < 1. Now, yi = xi +wi and a
necessary condition for having |xi + wi| > p/2 is that at least one between |xi| and |wi|

March 10, 2016

DRAFT

28

TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY, VOL., NO., MONTH YEAR

is bigger than p/4. The probability that |wi| > p/4 can be shown to decrease to 0 when
n tends to inﬁnity with the same argument used to treat (28). Hence, asymptotically
speaking, there can be a decoding error due to points z ∈ pZn (cid:114) {0} only for the x
such that |xi| > p/4 for some i. Let us show that also this case does not represent a
real problem: recall that H is the random parity-check matrix of the shaping lattice Λ

Some simple computations show that the product ΨΘ is very similar to (13) and (14)

On the other hand, Φ can be shown to be O(exp(−Dn2λR)) for some constant D.

Hence the whole product tends to 0 as n grows to inﬁnity when 2λR > 1 − ω, that is
ω > 1 − 2λR. The hypotheses R > 1/2 and λ > (1 + R)−1 > 1/2 guarantee that we
can take ω to satisfy the previous condition without contradicting (8). Thus, we can
state that (34) tends to 0 when n goes to inﬁnity.

3) We separately treat also the case of the z such that z ≡ 2x mod p. Does this kind of
z induce any decoding error? For what x? The strategy to answer these questions is
the same that we have adopted in the previous two points. Let us start by considering
z = 2x. There is no decoding error due to z if (cid:107)αy− 2x(cid:107)2 > (cid:107)αy− x(cid:107)2. Recalling that
y = x + w, this is equivalent to 3(cid:107)x(cid:107)2 − 2αxyT = (3− 2α)(cid:107)x(cid:107)2 − 2αxwT > 0. Since
α < 1, in order to show that z = 2x does not induce any error, it is thus sufﬁcient to
show that (cid:107)x(cid:107)2 − 2|xwT| > 0 with probability tending to 1 when n tends to inﬁnity.
If (23) and (33) occur,

(cid:107)x(cid:107)2 − 2|xwT| ≥ nP (1 − ε(cid:48))2 − 2f (n)σ(cid:107)x(cid:107)

where the last inequality is due to the fact that SNR = P/σ2 > 1; taking f (n) = o(
the lower bound is clearly asymptotically positive and we are done.
We have proved that z = 2x typically does not induce any error. Can we say the same
for all the other z ≡ 2x mod p? The only case that could lead to bad decoding is the
one of z ≡ 2x mod p such that (cid:107)αy − z(cid:107)2 < (cid:107)αy − 2x(cid:107)2 (otherwise, the previous
computation concerning z = 2x is sufﬁcient). Let z = 2x + pk for some k ∈ Zn (cid:114){0}.
Then z can be closer to αy than 2x only if there exists i such that

n),

|αyi − 2xi − pki| < |αyi − 2xi|,

for some ki ≥ 1. This is possible only if |αwi − (2− α)xi| = |αyi − 2xi| > p/2, which
in turn implies that at least one between |αwi| and (2 − α)|xi| has to be greater than
p/4. Now, one can use basically the same argument as the one applied for the z of
pZn above, and conclude that P{|αwi| > p/4} tends to 0, as does this sum:

P{Xs = x,∃z ∈ Λf ∩ B and z (cid:54)= x}.

4) Finally, what about the z such that z ≡ x mod p? Even if a z of this kind is closer
than x to αy, its syndrome HzT is equal to s, the syndrome of x, and this does not
give a decoding error. For this reason, we can actually omit these z from the total sum
and not consider them.

Concretely, with the previous four points we have shown that

P{Xs = x,∃z ∈ Λf ∩B inducing an error, z ≡ µx, ∃µ ∈ {0, 1, 2}} = 0.

choice of Hf and the event related to the random noise are independent.

Recall that B is a random object, that depends on x and w. We have already observed
that x lies inside it with very high probability. Given this, z cannot be simultaneously inside

IX. INTERLUDE: EXPANSION PROPERTIES OF BIPARTITE GRAPHS

We have achieved our main result on random Construction-A Voronoi constellations. Before
moving to the low-density construction, we need to treat in this self-contained section a graph-
theoretical problem that will have relevant applications in the sequel. Let G = (VL, VR, E)
be an undirected bipartite graph; VL ∪ VR is its set of (left and right) vertices and E its set
of edges. Let |VL| = n and |VR| = f n, for some constant fraction f ∈ Q (cid:114) {0} (that can
be bigger than 1). Parallel edges are accepted: there might be two or more edges connecting
the same two vertices.
Deﬁnition 12 (Neighborhood). If S is a subset of vertices of a graph G, its neighborhood
N (S) is deﬁned as the set of vertices of the graph that are incident to a vertex of S.

In a bipartite graph G = (VL, VR, E), it is clear that N (S) ⊆ VR for every S ⊆ VL and

vice versa N (T ) ⊆ VL for every T ⊆ VR. See Fig. 3 for a simple example.

From now on, we will consider only graphs with the following variation of the biregularity
property: the number of edges incident to any single vertex of VR (resp. VL) has constant
cardinality ∆ (resp. f ∆). Consequently, the neighborhood of any single vertex of VR (resp.
VL) has cardinality at most ∆ (resp. f ∆). If the graph has no parallel edges, these cardinalities
are exactly ∆ and f ∆ and the graph is biregular, according to the standard deﬁnition. Denote
by F(n, f, ∆) the family of graphs just deﬁned.

We are interested in some particular expansion properties of this kind of graph. In other
words, we are interested in studying what graphs are such that any “small” set of vertices
has a “big enough” neighborhood. Thus we give the following deﬁnition:

S

Figure 3. A bipartite graph with an example of neighborhood of a subset of vertices. VL is the set of round vertices, VR
is the set of square vertices. Observe that S ⊆ N (N (S)) and the inclusion is generally strict.

Deﬁnition 13 (D-good graphs). Let D > 0 be a constant. We say that a bipartite graph of
F(n, f, ∆) is D-good from left to right if

∀S ⊆ VL such that |S| ≤ n

Important remark: notice that the two conditions above imply that every subset of nodes

graph, has a neighborhood at least as big as a fraction of D/(D + 1) of the number of nodes
on the other side.

The proof of the previous lemma can be found in Appendix F and uses the same main
ideas that Bassalygo applies in [2]. Nevertheless, our statement is slightly different and some
elements of the proof are modiﬁed with respect to Bassalygo’s one. The reader may also be
interested in comparing this lemma with Theorem 8.7 of [33, p. 431] and reading therein
about the construction of expander codes.

Proof: Lemma 9 states that G is D-good from left to right (asymptotically, with proba-
bility tending to 1). We only need to prove that it is also D-good from right to left. But this
is simply the application of Lemma 9 to the family F(m, f(cid:48), ∆(cid:48)) with m = f n, f(cid:48) = f−1,
and ∆(cid:48) = f ∆, which represents F(n, f, ∆) with the nodes and their degree distributions
switched from left to right and vice versa.

X. ACHIEVING CAPACITY WITH LDA LATTICES

From now on, we will adapt the results of the previous sections to the family of LDA

lattices:
Deﬁnition 14 (LDA lattice). A lattice Λ ⊆ Rn is called a Low-Density Construction-A (or
brieﬂy LDA) lattice if it is built with Construction A from an LDPC code.

We recall that Low-Density Parity-Check codes are linear codes whose parity-check matrix

is sparse, i.e., whose great majority of the entries is equal to zero [21].

As we have anticipated in Section I, inﬁnite constellations of LDA lattices have already
been shown to be very well-performing under iterative decoding [9]. An example of their
performance, obtained with the decoding algorithm presented in [9], can be found in Fig. 4.
The possibility of achieving Poltyrev limit with LDA lattices was shown in [10] and [11].
Our main goal here is to prove that they can achieve capacity of the AWGN channel under
MMSE lattice decoding with similar hypotheses to the ones of Theorem 2. The geometrical
approach to demonstrate our result, as well as the encoding and decoding scheme, will be the
very same that we have used for the more general Construction-A ensemble in the previous

sections. Therefore, we will go once again along the same steps that have led to the proof
of Theorem 2. Nevertheless, some of these will need to be modiﬁed and adapted to the
low-density structure of the parity-check matrices of the LDA lattices. In particular, we will
extensively employ the expansion properties of the random Tanner graphs [33] associated
with them. We strongly emphasize this point: the D-goodness hypothesis (cf. Deﬁnition 13)
of our Tanner graphs has to be considered one of the most novel tool of this entire work.
It is used here in a clearer, more complete, and more elegant way than in the preliminary
versions [11], [12].

Finally, we point out that for this ﬁnite-constellation result the degree of the parity-check
nodes of the Tanner graphs associated with our LDA lattices is constant. As said in Section
I, this is not a negligible detail, since the complexity of the iterative decoding algorithm
is proportional to the parity-check degree and it is important to keep it bounded. This also
contrasts sharply, and somewhat surprisingly, with the behavior of binary LDPC codes that
need growing row weights to achieve capacity.

XI. THE RANDOM LDA ENSEMBLE

Once again, our lattice codes are given by Voronoi constellations of nested Construction-A
lattices. However, this time we restrict our construction to LDA lattices. The random ensemble
of ﬁne lattices (cf. Deﬁnition 5) is built as follows:

1) Fix some constant 0 < Rf < 1.
2) Consider a bipartite graph with n left nodes (variable nodes) and n(1− Rf ) right nodes

(check nodes).

3) The check nodes have degree ∆P , the variable nodes have degree ∆P (1 − Rf ).
4) The edges are ﬁxed once for all by taking a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n(1 − Rf )∆P}
at random and connecting the left n(1 − Rf )∆P sockets to the right n(1 − Rf )∆P
sockets according to the permutation.
5) Contingent parallel edges are uniﬁed.
6) Consider the binary parity-check matrix that has this graph as its Tanner graph.
7) Substitute each 1 in the binary matrix with a random variable with uniform distribution
over {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}; notice that this is equivalent to assigning to every edge of the
Tanner graph a random label chosen in {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}.

8) Our random LDA ﬁne lattice Λf will be the lattice obtained with Construction A from
the p-ary LDPC code deﬁned by the previous random p-ary parity-check matrix and
associated with the previous Tanner graph.

We emphasize that the positions of the random entries in the parity-check matrix is determin-
istically ﬁxed by the permutation. The randomness in the matrix is only given by its random
non-zero entries.

Now, let us build the random ensemble of LDA shaping lattices:

1) Fix some constant R such that 0 < R < Rf.
2) Use the same procedure as before to build a graph with n(Rf − R) check nodes of

degree ∆P and n variable nodes of degree ∆P (Rf − R).

3) Put some random p-ary labels on the deterministically ﬁxed edges of the graph and

associate with it a random parity-check matrix of dimension n(Rf − R) × n.

4) Our random LDA shaping lattice Λ will be the lattice obtained with Construction A
from the LDPC code whose random p-ary parity-check matrix of dimension n(1−R)×n
is the superposition of the matrix built at step 3 and the previously created ﬁne-lattice-
generating matrix.

The deterministic part of the construction is represented by the following binary matrix of

dimension n(1 − R) × n:

 H(cid:48)

Hf

 ;

H =

Hf is the lower submatrix formed by the last n(1 − Rf ) rows and corresponding to the
(unlabeled) Tanner graph of the ﬁne lattice. H is ﬁxed once for all, according to the choice
of the permutations that create the corresponding graphs. It has ∆P non-zero entries in each
row and ∆V = ∆P (1−R) non-zero entries in each column (explaining why the associated p-
ary codes are LDPC). Substituting to each 1 in H a random variable which takes equiprobable
values in {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}, we obtain the random matrix

 H(cid:48)

Hf

 .

H =

Deﬁnition 15 (Skeleton matrix). In this context, we call the binary matrix H (resp. Hf) the
skeleton of the random matrix H (resp. Hf).

The random ﬁne lattice of our ensemble is Λf, generated by Hf, while the random shaping
lattice is Λ, generated by H. They are nested lattices (Λ ⊆ Λf) and the Voronoi constellations
that we will deal with are given by Λf /Λ. Observe the numerous similarities with respect to
the construction of the random ensemble of Section V.

As we have already anticipated, the proof of Theorem 3 is strongly based on the fact
that the graph that underlies our random ensemble of lattices has some particular expansion
properties: Corollary 1 of Section IX guarantees that (for n tending to inﬁnity and with
probability tending to 1) the Tanner graph associated with Λf is D-good for every D ≥ 1
such that:

this implies that (49) is a sufﬁcient condition for the asymptotic D-goodness of the family
F(n, 1 − R, ∆P ) (cf. the notation of Section IX). A simple application of Stirling’s formula
shows that the number of graphs in F(n, 1 − R, ∆P ) and the number of possible Tanner
graphs associated with H are asymptotically the same:

(n(1 − R)∆P )! ∼ (n(1 − Rf )∆P )! (n(Rf − R)∆P )!.

DRAFT

March 10, 2016

DI PIETRO et al.: LDA LATTICES ACHIEVE CAPACITY

39

For this reason, (49) is also sufﬁcient to claim that the graph associated with H is D-good
with probability tending to 1 when n tends to inﬁnity.

Remark: from now on, we will always assume that the Tanner graphs associated with the
skeleton matrices H and Hf are D-good, neglecting the probabilistic aspect of this assertion.
When n is big enough, this will be almost always the case and we can assume that good
permutations in the graph construction are chosen. Moreover, this is not a loss in generality
for the construction of the lattice ensemble, since its randomness comes from the random
entries of the matrices and not from the position of these entries in the matrix, which are
ﬁxed once for all.

A consequence of the D-goodness of the Tanner graphs is that we can ﬁnd a lower bound
of the minimum Hamming distance of the LDPC codes underlying our LDA construction:

Lemma 10 (Asymptotic goodness of non-binary LDPC codes). Let Λf be our random n-
dimensional LDA ﬁne lattice (p = nλ) with

Moreover, for every x ∈ Λf, let w(x) = |{i : xi (cid:54)= 0}|. Then, for every δ < D(1−Rf )/(D+1),

In other words, the minimum Hamming distance of the LDPC code underlying our construc-
tion is typically lower bounded by D(1 − Rf )n/(D + 1) − o(1).

Remark: we invite the reader to pay particular attention to the proof of this lemma. The
argument used here is a prototype of the application of expansion properties to the more
general techniques utilized in Lemma 12 and Theorem 3. In what follows, it is easy to
understand how the probability of an integer point to belong to an LDA lattice (or an LDPC
code) is estimated thanks to the D-goodness of the associated graphs, in spite of the difﬁculties
arising from the low density.

Proof: Let Λf = Cf + pZn, where Cf is the random LDPC code associated with the
random parity-check matrix Hf. Let X be the random variable that counts the number of

Case 1: w(x) ≤ n/(D + 1). By deﬁnition of parity-check matrix,

P {x ∈ Cf} = P(cid:8)Hf xT ≡ 0T mod p(cid:9) .

Let us call Supp(x) = {j : xj (cid:54)= 0} and, if hi = (h1, . . . , hn) is a row of Hf, let us deﬁne
Supp(hi) = {j : hj is a random variable}. Then, since hj = 0 for every j (cid:54)∈ Supp(hi), we
deduce that

P(cid:8)hixT ≡ 0 mod p(cid:9) =

Now, the rows of Hf such that Supp(x) ∩ Supp(hi) (cid:54)= ∅ are exactly |N (Supp(x))| and the

XII. LDA LATTICES ACHIEVE CAPACITY - DETAILED PROOF

A. The encoding and decoding scheme

The encoding and decoding scheme that we apply to LDA Voronoi constellations is the
same that we have described in Section VI and summarized in Fig. 1 of Section IV for the
case of more general Construction-A lattices. Nothing changes at all and the fact that the
lattices that we deal with now are LDA does not affect the information transmission scheme.

B. A useful lemma

In the sequel we will often need to compare the volumes of two spheres with the same
radius, but different dimensions. This lemma contains once for all the computation that leads
to this comparison and its simple proof is in Appendix G.

Lemma 11. Consider the two balls Bc,n(ρ) and Bc(cid:48),n−m(ρ), with the same given radius
ρ, but with different dimensions n and n − m. Suppose also that 0 ≤ m ≤ n/2. Then, if

C. The typical norm of a constellation point

The next lemma states that our Voronoi LDA constellation points have the same typical
norm of the more general Construction-A constellation points of Section VIII. The proof of
the lemma follows that of Lemma 6, but needs to be adapted to the LDA setting in which we
work. This requires some tricky combinatorial analysis of the structure of the Tanner graphs
associated with the random lattices. The most interesting argument is probably the variance
estimation that starts from (65) and goes on till the end of the proof. Similar reasonings will
be used in the proof of Theorem 3.

Like in Section VIII, let ρeﬀ denote the asymptotic effective radius of the shaping lattice

associated with the parity-check matrix H:

with a message and a constellation point. Suppose that p = nλ for some λ > 0 and let

Remark: the hypotheses of the lemma imply that the Tanner graphs associated with both
the ﬁne and the shaping (random) lattices can be assumed to be D-good. Moreover, the
hypotheses of Lemma 10 are met. Finally, if we compare this statement to Lemma 6, notice
that (8) reduces to ω < 1 because of (53).

Proof: First of all, let us consider the Tanner graph associated with H and see what
properties derive from its D-goodness. If V is its set of variable nodes (of cardinality n) and
P its set of check nodes (of cardinality n(1 − R)), (46) and (47) with f = (1 − R) imply:

We will extensively use these expansion properties in this proof.

Now, let Xρ be the random variable that counts the number of points with syndrome s in
the n-dimensional ball B0,n(ρ). For any ρ ≥ 0 and for any x ∈ Zn ∩ B0,n(ρ), consider the
random variable

x∈Zn∩B0,n(ρ)

x∈Zn∩B0,n(ρ)(cid:114)pZn

because the probability that the points of pZn have syndrome s (cid:54)= 0 is 0. Let us also deﬁne
the support of x:

Supp(x) = {j : xj (cid:54)≡ 0 mod p}

(56)

and, if h is a row of H,

Supp(h) = {j : hj is a random variable}.

If we call hi the i-th row of H and si is the i-th coordinate of s, supposing that x is a given
point of Zn ∩ B0,n(ρ) (cid:114) pZn, we can deduce that:

• If Supp(x) ∩ Supp(hi) (cid:54)= ∅, then P{hixT ≡ si mod p} = 1/p.
• If Supp(x) ∩ Supp(hi) = ∅ and si = 0, then P{hixT ≡ si mod p} = 1.
• If Supp(x) ∩ Supp(hi) = ∅ and si (cid:54)= 0, then P{hixT ≡ si mod p} = 0.

In order to quantify P{Xx = 1}, it is then important to know the size of the set

Tx = {i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n(1 − R)} : Supp(hi) ∩ Supp(x) (cid:54)= ∅}.

Tx is identiﬁed with the set of the parity-check equation nodes of the Tanner graph associated
with H whose support intersects the support of x, then Tx ⊆ P . Let us suppose for a moment

Now notice that for any ﬁxed x, all its coordinates that belong to N (P (cid:114) Tx) ⊆ V have to
be equal to 0 (modulo p) by deﬁnition of Tx, because all the non-zero coordinates of x are
connected via an edge in the Tanner graph to an equation of Tx. Therefore,

By Lemma 10, we can assume without loss of generality that there is no point of the ﬁne

P{Xx = 1} = P{HxT ≡ sT mod p} ≤ P{Hf xT ≡ 0T mod p} = P{x ∈ Λf} = 0.

This means that once P (cid:114) Tx is ﬁxed, at least D|P (cid:114) Tx|/(1− R) coordinates of x are equal

Now, let h be a generic row of H; it represents a parity-check equation and we also write
h ∈ P . For a given x ∈ Zn ∩ B0,n(ρ) (cid:114) pZn, let xh be the subvector of x made only of the
coordinates of x that belong to the neighborhood N (h) of h in the graph. In other words,
these are the coordinates of x that correspond to ones in the row of the skeleton matrix H
of H corresponding to h.

Let us ﬁx x, z ∈ Zn ∩ B0,n(ρ) (cid:114) pZn and a row h of H and consider the vector space
generated by xh and zh, which can have dimension 0, 1, or 2 over R. We call the latter
dim(x, z|h). Hence, denoting s the syndrome coordinate corresponding to h, we have:

• if dim(x, z|h) = 0 and s = 0, then P{hxT ≡ s mod p, hzT ≡ s mod p} = 1;

• if dim(x, z|h) = 1 and s = 0, then P{hxT ≡ s mod p, hzT ≡ s mod p} = 1/p;
• if dim(x, z|h) = 1 and s (cid:54)= 0, then P{hxT ≡ s mod p, hzT ≡ s mod p} = 1/p if

zh ≡ xh mod p, otherwise it is 0;

• if dim(x, z|h) = 2, then P{hxT ≡ s mod p, hzT ≡ s mod p} = 1/p2.

Summarizing, given x, z ∈ Zn ∩ B0,n(ρ) (cid:114) pZn, we can consider the partition of the set of
parity-check equations P given by the following three sets:

Jx,z = {h ∈ P : dim(x, z|h) = 0},
Ix,z = {h ∈ P : dim(x, z|h) = 1},
Tx,z = {h ∈ P : dim(x, z|h) = 2};

Notice that the coordinates of x and z that belong to N (Jx,z) have to be equal to 0 (modulo
p). Hence, if we suppose that

|Jx,z| ≥ n(1 − R) − A(n),

(69)
we can use the very same argument used before in the study of |P (cid:114) Tx| (from (58) on), to
prove that

P{HxT ≡ sT mod p, HzT ≡ sT mod p} ≤ P{Hf xT ≡ 0T mod p, Hf zT ≡ 0T mod p}

Instead, for the x and z that satisfy the opposite of (69), recalling that H has n(1− R) = |P|

Before estimating the sum, we will need to investigate the structure of Ix,z and its neigh-
borhood. For this purpose, consider the graph G(cid:48)
x,z that consists of the bipartite subgraph
of the whole Tanner graph (called G) given by the parity-check equation nodes of Ix,z, the
variable nodes of N (Ix,z), and the edges connecting them. A priori, G(cid:48)
x,z can be made of
many different (bipartite) connected components, depending for example on the size of Ix,z
(even if G is connected with very high probability, tending to 1 when n tends to inﬁnity).
The set of vertices of each one of these components is made of a subset of N (Ix,z) (variable
nodes) and a subset of Ix,z (parity-check equation nodes). The connected components can be
(trivially) partitioned into two kinds: the ones whose set of parity-check equations has size
bigger than n(1 − R)/(D + 1) and the ones for which this does not hold. So, if C is the
x,z and PC ⊆ P is its set of parity-check equation nodes,
generic connected component of G(cid:48)
let us deﬁne:

(cid:26)
(cid:26)

Kx,z =

C ⊆ G(cid:48)

Mx,z =

C ⊆ G(cid:48)

(cid:27)
(cid:27)

x,z : |PC| ≤ n(1 − R)
D + 1
n(1 − R)
x,z : |PC| >
D + 1

and

.

(73)

Of course, G(cid:48)

x,z = Kx,z ∪ Mx,z and the union is disjoint. If we deﬁne

(cid:91){PC : C ∈ Kx,z} ⊆ P and
(cid:91){PC : C ∈ Mx,z} ⊆ P,

Kx,z =

Mx,z =

then we can also write Ix,z = Kx,z ∪ Mx,z and again the union is disjoint.

Now, by deﬁnition and by the expansion properties, every PC ⊆ Kx,z is such that |N (PC)| ≥

D|PC|/(1 − R), so this holds for the whole Kx,z, too (in G(cid:48)

x,z and a fortiori in G):

|N (Kx,z)| ≥ D|Kx,z|
1 − R

.

(74)

Another useful observation is that |Mx,z| ≤ 1; in other words, there cannot be more than one
connected component whose parity-check equation set is “big”. Indeed, each one of these
sets is such that its neighborhood has size at least Dn/(D + 1). If there were two (or more)
connected components in Mx,z, the union of these neighborhoods would exceed the size of
the whole set of variable nodes of the Tanner graph itself, which is impossible.

A small remark before proceeding with the estimation of (75) and (76): a priori, we are
summing also over the x and z such that |Ix,z| = 0 = |Jx,z|. This implies that |Tx,z| =
n(1 − R) and that
P{HxT ≡ sT mod p, HzT ≡ sT mod p} = P{HxT ≡ sT mod p}P{HzT ≡ sT mod p}.

The consequence is that in this particular case Cov(Xx, Xx) = 0 and the actual contribution
to the variance of these couples of x and z is null. Consequently, when needed and without
loss of generality, we will restrict the sum to the case |Ix,z| + |Jx,z| (cid:54)= 0. We will recall this
observation in the sequel.

1) If |Mx,z| = 0, then Ix,z = Kx,z and |N (Ix,z)| = |N (Kx,z)| ≥ D|Ix,z|/(1 − R).
Let us estimate in this context the number of x and z for a given value of |Jx,z| ≤
n(1− R)− A(n) ≤ n(1− R)/(D + 1) in this case. |Jx,z| is “small” and the expansion
properties imply that

|N (Jx,z)| ≥ D|Jx,z|
1 − R

.

By deﬁnition of Jx,z, this implies that at least D|Jx,z|/(1−R) coordinates of x and z are
ﬁxed to 0 (modulo p). Fixing these coordinates is equivalent to ﬁxing the parity-check
equations of Jx,z inside P .
On the other hand, what can we say about z? Observe that, by deﬁnition, xh and zh
are multiple modulo p for every parity-check equation h that corresponds to a vertex
of Ix,z. Moreover, the condition λ > 2R, contained in (53), implies that 2ρ = o(p),
which in turn implies that are no couples of integer points of B0,n(ρ) that are equivalent
modulo p (a shift of a simple coordinate modulo p from a value to a different value in
the same equivalence class is a shift of more than the diameter of the ball and brings

the point out of it). Hence, for a ﬁxed x, the z that we take into account cannot take
more than p different values with respect to x in the coordinates that correspond to
N (Ix,z) (and we know that these coordinates are at least D|Ix,z|/(1− R)). Fixing them
is the same as ﬁxing the parity-check equations of Ix,z inside P .
Putting together all of these observations, we obtain that when |Mx,z| = 0,

|{x, z ∈ Zn ∩ B0,n(ρ) (cid:114) pZn : |Ix,z| = i,|Jx,z| = j}|

never equal to 1 under our assumption that i + j (cid:54)= 0. As a consequence,

f (n)p−D(2j+i)n(j+i)p2(i+j) = fj(n)fi+j(n)n−jλDn(j+i)(1−λ(D−2)) = o(1).

Furthermore, we will not perform it here in all details, but a more precise analysis of
the series in (81) shows that (82) is actually sufﬁcient to conclude that

We will need this inequality later, after the estimation of the variance for the case
|Mx,z| = 1.

2) If |Mx,z| = 1, then the graph G(cid:48)

x,z contains a “big” connected component and |Mx,z| >

n(1 − R)/(D + 1), which implies by the expansion properties that
|N (Ix,z ∪ Jx,z)| ≥ |N (Ix,z)| ≥ |N (Mx,z)| ≥ Dn
D + 1

(84)
If we call Rx,z = V (cid:114) N (Ix,z ∪ Jx,z), we have that |Rx,z| ≤ n/(D + 1). Moreover,
N (Rx,z) ⊆ Tx,z and the expansion properties of the graph guarantee that |N (Rx,z)| ≥
D(1 − R)|Rx,z|, from which we deduce that

.

|Tx,z| + |Jx,z| ≥ |Tx,z| ≥ |N (Rx,z)| ≥ D(1 − R)|Rx,z|.

These considerations will help us in counting the number of x and z such that |Jx,z| ≤
n(1− R)− A(n) ≤ n(1− R)/(D + 1) and |Mx,z| = 1. First of all, the same argument
of the case |Mx,z| = 0 holds: at least D|Jx,z|/(1 − R) of the coordinates of x and z
are ﬁxed to be 0 (modulo p) and these coordinates are identiﬁed by the parity-check
equations in Jx,z. Concerning z, given a ﬁxed x, its coordinates are ﬁxed to 0 in the
neighborhood of Jx,z and can take up to p different values in the neighborhood of Ix,z
(these values are the multiples modulo p of the coordinates of x). This allows us to
conclude that

(cid:18)n(1 − R)
(cid:19)

We are always implicitly using the fact that 2ρ = o(p) and that a ﬁxed coordinate of an
integer point inside a ball of radius ρ cannot take more than p different values (from
which we get, for example, the crude estimation: |Zr ∩ B0,r(ρ)| ≤ pr).

Now, we would like to estimate k = |Kx,z|. By deﬁnition of Kx,z and Mx,z, we have
that N (Kx,z) ⊆ V (cid:114) N (Mx,z); moreover, (84) tells us that |N (Mx,z)| ≥ Dn/(D + 1).
This implies that |N (Kx,z)| ≤ n − |N (Mx,z)| ≤ n/(D + 1). Then, by the expansion
properties, |N (N (Kx,z))| ≥ D(1− R)|N (Kx,z)|. Notice that Kx,z is “small” by deﬁni-
tion and, thanks to the expansion properties, we have that |N (Kx,z)| ≥ D|Kx,z|/(1−R).
Since N (N (Kx,z)) ⊆ P (cid:114) Mx,z = Jx,z ∪ Kx,z ∪ Tx,z, we deduce that

|Jx,z| + |Kx,z| + |Tx,z| ≥ |N (N (Kx,z))| ≥ D(1 − R)|N (Kx,z)| ≥ D2|Kx,z|,

or, equivalently,

|Kx,z| ≤ |Jx,z| + |Tx,z|

If we apply this estimation to (85), also recalling that |Jx,z| +|Tx,z| ≥ D(1− R)|Rx,z|,

D. The proof that capacity is achieved with LDA lattices

Now that we have proved that in the case of LDA Voronoi constellations the sent point
has the same typical norm of the constellation points of the more general Construction A,
we are ready to prove the result that LDA lattices can achieve the capacity of the AWGN
channel under MMSE lattice decoding. We repeat that the transmission scheme is the same
of Section VI and the proof of the theorem is then very similar to the one of Theorem 2.
Nevertheless, we will have to adapt it to the LDPC structure that gives rise to LDA lattices,
just like we had to adapt the proof of the previous lemma.

then the random ensemble of nested LDA lattices presented in Section XI achieves capacity

Remark: the proof of this theorem strongly relies on the techniques that we have already
applied in the proofs of Theorem 2 and Lemma 12. For this reason, we will skip some
details and some technical computations that would have the disadvantage of making it much
longer and less readable. Everything which is not completely developed is a straightforward
modiﬁcation of some well-referenced computations that were previously carried out. We
strongly recommend to get familiar with the arguments used in the demonstrations of Theorem
2 and Lemma 12 before reading the sequel in depth.

Proof: The geometric and probabilistic strategy to prove this theorem is the same that we
have applied to prove Theorem 2. Namely, the beginnings of the two proofs are identical and
almost everything coincides; the small differences can be easily solved by a slight adaptation
of what is done in the proof of Theorem 2. For this reason, we claim that the only thing that
we need to prove is that

where the deﬁnition of dim(x, z|h) is the same that we have given in the proof of Lemma
12 (see also (66), (67), and (68)). We will employ the very same expansion arguments used
in the proof of Lemma 12, but this time applied to the D-good Tanner graph associated with
Hf, instead of H. From now on, we will call V its set of variable nodes and P its set of
check nodes. Furthermore, notice that (49) is assumed in order to guarantee that both of them
are D-good, as anticipated in Section XI. First of all, we can argue like we did from (69) to
(70) to claim that

P{Hf xT ≡ 0T mod p, Hf zT ≡ 0T mod p} = 0

for every couple of x and z such that

|Jx,z| ≥ n(1 − R) − B(n), with B(n) = n(1 − Rf )

Z = {z ∈ B(cid:48) ∩ Zn : z (cid:54)≡ µx mod p,∀µ ∈ {0, 1, 2}, and |Jx,z| ≤ n(1 − R) − B(n)},

we can compute P{Hf xT ≡ 0T mod p, Hf zT ≡ 0T mod p} analogously to (71) and obtain
that the sum in (91) is equal to

and do not need to be repeated.

used in this proof to show that (99) converges to 0 when n tends to inﬁnity.

Conclusion. The sum of (93), (97), and (98) is a vanishing upper bound of (92). Therefore,

the limit in (91) holds true and the theorem is proved.

XIII. CONCLUSIONS

In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we have given a new proof that random Construction-A
Voronoi constellations achieve the capacity of the AWGN channel with lattice encoding
and decoding. We have obtained this result without employing the dithering technique, thus
simplifying the information transmission scheme with respect to other solutions proposed
in the literature. Also, we have explicitly shown how the prime number p that underlies
Construction A has to grow as a function of the lattice dimension n: it is of the same order

as nλ, for a positive constant λ whose lower bound varies between 1/2 and 2/3 depending
on the rate of the linear code involved in the construction. The proof of this capacity result
is also based on a lemma which states the sphericity of our Voronoi random constellation:
its points typically lie very close to the surface of a ball, called the shaping sphere, whose
radius is the effective radius of the shaping lattice.

The second part of the paper is dedicated to LDA lattices. We have adapted the arguments
used in the case of random Construction A to show the novel result that there exists a
family of LDA Voronoi constellations which is capacity-achieving under lattice encoding and
decoding. Again, we have expressed in formulae the dependence of p on n, ﬁnding lower
bounds of λ that are still constant, but larger than the ones of the random-Construction-A
case. Furthermore, we have shown the sphericity of LDA Voronoi constellations, too. One
important feature of our LDA ensemble is that the row and column Hamming weights of
the associated parity-check matrices are well-determined constants and do not need to grow
with n.

The probabilistic arguments used for dealing with the technical difﬁculties that arise from
the low density of the LDA parity-check matrices are based on what we have called the D-
goodness of the associated Tanner graphs. This property is a crucial tool in our analysis and
has also made possible an estimation of the minimum Hamming distance and the fundamental
gain of our LDA-lattice family.

The analysis of lattice decoding of capacity-achieving LDA lattices that we carried out
relies on ML/MAP block-wise decoding of the embedded LDPC ensemble. Modern coding
theory offers low-complexity iterative decoding methods for LDPC codes which make LDA
decoding practically feasible. For this reason, it could be interesting in the future to investigate
theoretically the performance of LDA lattices under iterative decoding. Nevertheless, at the
present moment and to the best of our knowledge, no theoretical tools are available to prove
that LDA ensembles are capacity-achieving with iterative message-passing decoding. The
latter attains the MAP performance of an LDPC ensemble when applied to the associated
spatially-coupled ensemble for binary codes and binary symmetric memoryless channels [23].
Hence, in practical applications non-binary spatial coupling is a potential way to enhance
the performance of LDA lattices. However, any future theoretical breakthrough on iterative
LDA decoding is conditioned on ﬁnding an exact solution of density evolution for non-binary
codes on graphs.

APPENDIX E

PROOF OF LEMMA 8

Proof: If z ∈ Z we denote by z ∈ Z the element of the class of z modulo p with
the smallest absolute value; that is, z ≡ z mod p and z is the class representative lying in
{−(p − 1)/2,−(p − 3)/2, . . . , (p − 1)/2}. The notation adapts to integer vectors, too.

First of all, notice that z ≡ µx mod p means z = µx + pk, for some k ∈ Zn. Hence, if

we call ν = 1 − µ,

(cid:107)x − z(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)x − µx − pk(cid:107)2
≥ (cid:107)(1 − µ)x − pk(cid:107)2
= (cid:107)(1 − µ)x(cid:107)2
= (cid:107)νx(cid:107)2.

If (cid:107)νx(cid:107)2 > 4ρ2, then (cid:107)x − z(cid:107)2 > 4ρ2, too. In other words, z lies outside Bx,n(2ρ) and x
does not have to be counted among the ones contributing to N (µ). That is,

N (µ) ≤ |{x ∈ Zn ∩ Beﬀ : (cid:107)νx(cid:107)2 ≤ 4ρ2}| = N(cid:48)(µ).

Now, let C ≥ 3 be a ﬁxed constant and, given x, consider

which is a nonsense (notice that the second - strict - inequality is true for n large enough).
Before going on, for a given x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) and for a subset of indices I ⊆

{1, 2, . . . , n} we deﬁne x(I) to be the vector (x(I)1, x(I)2, . . . , x(I)n) such that

First estimate: |ν| ≤ √

p. When ν is “small”, denoting J c = {1, 2, . . . , n} (cid:114) J, we have

(cid:107)νx(cid:107)2 ≥ (cid:107)νx(J c)(cid:107)2 = (cid:107)νx(J c)(cid:107)2 ≥ 4(cid:107)x(J c)(cid:107)2;

the equality holds by deﬁnition of J and because |ν| ≤ √
p, whereas the second inequality
comes from the hypothesis on the range of µ, that implies |ν| ≥ 2. Now, if (cid:107)x(J c)(cid:107)2 > ρ2,
then the previous chain of inequalities gives (cid:107)νx(cid:107)2 > 4ρ2. Hence,

N(cid:48)(µ) ≤ |{x ∈ Zn ∩ Beﬀ : (cid:107)x(J c)(cid:107)2 ≤ ρ2}|

Notice that the binomial coefﬁcient is upper bounded by the subexponential function nnγ
and, similarly,

|Z(cid:98)nγ(cid:99) ∩ B0,(cid:98)nγ(cid:99)(ρeﬀ(1 + 1/nω))| ≤ |Z(cid:98)nγ(cid:99) ∩ [−ρeﬀ(1 + 1/nω), ρeﬀ(1 + 1/nω)](cid:98)nγ(cid:99)|

for some constant D and γ < 1. We can conclude that

for some subexponential function f (n).

√

Second estimate: |ν| >

p. Let η be a constant such that 0 < η < 1. We say that
x ∈ Zn ∩ Beﬀ is heavy if for all K ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} such that |K| ≤ (1 − η)n, we have

(cid:107)x(K)(cid:107)2 > 4ρ2/C 2. Qualitatively speaking, a heavy x is such that every “quite small”
subset of coordinates still gives a “big enough” contribution to the total norm of x itself.

Now, consider

I = {i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} : |νxi| < C|xi|}.

Suppose that x is heavy, then, if |I| ≤ (1 − η)n,

(cid:107)νx(cid:107)2 ≥ (cid:107)νx(I)(cid:107)2 ≥ C 2(cid:107)x(I)(cid:107)2 > 4ρ2,

where the second inequality is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition of I. This means that
in this case
N(cid:48)(µ) ≤ |{x ∈ Zn ∩ Beﬀ : x is not heavy}| + |{x ∈ Zn ∩ Beﬀ : x is heavy, |I| > (1 − η)n}|.

Let us call N1(µ) the ﬁrst addend and N2(µ) the second one and estimate them.

Estimation of N1(µ). If x is not heavy, there exists K ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} such that |K| ≤
(1−η)n and (cid:107)x(K)(cid:107)2 ≤ 4ρ2/C 2. Notice that if this is true for K = ∅, then the same property
holds a fortiori for a bigger K. Then, if h(·) is the binary entropy funcion and supposing
without loss of generality that (1 − η)n is integer,
N1(µ) ≤ |{x ∈ Zn ∩ Beﬀ : ∃K ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} with |K| ≤ (1 − η)n,(cid:107)x(K)(cid:107)2 ≤ 4ρ2/C 2}|

Let S ⊆ Beﬀ be the set of integer points whose cardinality is N2(µ) and that we have to
estimate. We will create a relation φ : S → Beﬀ (a “function” with more than one image
per point), as follows: if x ∈ S, ﬁx |I(cid:48)|/2 coordinates of I(cid:48) and add to each of them 1 or
−1, in such a way that the new point is still inside Beﬀ. The set of images of x is made of

(cid:1) new points that we obtain with the(cid:0) |I(cid:48)|

(cid:1) different choices of coordinates to

all the(cid:0) |I(cid:48)|

modify. We denote it by φ(x) ⊆ Beﬀ. We have implicitly supposed that |I(cid:48)|/2 is integer, but
nothing would substantially change if |I(cid:48)| were odd. Observe that the number of images of
each single x is bounded from below by

Now, let

S(cid:48) = {x(cid:48) ∈ Beﬀ : x(cid:48) ∈ φ(x),∃x ∈ Beﬀ} ⊆ Beﬀ.

It is possible that a certain x(cid:48) ∈ S(cid:48) has more than one counterimage in S. We would like to
estimate how many they can be. In order to count them, pay attention to the following facts:
given an x in S, for all i ∈ I(cid:48) = I ∩ J we have that

√

• |xi| <
p/C 2 (by deﬁnition of J),
• |νxi| < C|xi| (by deﬁnition of I).

The two conditions together say that |νxi| <

With the same argument, we also have that for a negative xi,

|ν(xi + 1)| > C|xi + 1|.

Now, consider x(cid:48) ∈ φ(x) for some x ∈ S; what we have just shown implies that all the
i of x(cid:48) that are equal to a coordinate of x plus or minus 1 (i.e., all the “modiﬁed”
coordinates x(cid:48)
i|. As a consequence and by deﬁnition of I, every
coordinates of x), are such that |νx(cid:48)
x(cid:48) ∈ S(cid:48) has between |I(cid:48)|/2 and |I(cid:48)|/2 + (cid:98)ηn(cid:99) coordinates such that |νx(cid:48)
i|. On the
other hand, every x ∈ S has between 0 and (cid:98)ηn(cid:99) of them. This means that an upper bound of
the number M of counterimages of x(cid:48) ∈ S(cid:48) is given by the number of possible modiﬁcations
of plus or minus 1 (now only towards the surface of Beﬀ, since φ always “pushes” a point

PROOF OF LEMMA 9

Proof: First of all, let us order the set VL (putting it in bijection with {1, 2, . . . , n}) and
the set VR (in bijection with {1, 2, . . . , f n}); let us also order the set E of edges and call
e1, e2, . . . , ef ∆ the edges linked to the ﬁrst element of VL, ef ∆+1, ef ∆+2, . . . , e2f ∆ the edges
linked to the second element of VL, and so on. At the same time, call f1, f2, . . . , f∆ the
edges linked to the ﬁrst element of VR, f∆+1, f∆+2, . . . , f2∆ the edges linked to the second
element of VR, and so on. Then, a graph is determined by a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , ∆f n}
that assigns to every em exactly one of the fl.

By deﬁnition,

P{G is not D-good from left to right} ≤ P{G does not satisfy (46)}.

Evaluating this probability corresponds to counting the number of possible permutations of
