DESINGULARIZING SPECIAL GENERIC MAPS INTO

3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE

MASAYUKI NISHIOKA

Abstract. A smooth map between smooth manifolds is called a special
generic map if it has only deﬁnite fold points as its singularities. In this
paper, we study the desingularization problem of special generic maps
of closed orientable n-dimensional manifolds M into R3 for n ≥ 5. We
: M → Rp is lifted to an immersion or an
say that a smooth map f
embedding F : M → Rk (k > p) if f is factorized as f = π ◦ F for
the standard projection π : Rk → Rp. In this paper, we ﬁrst prove that
if n = 5 or 6 and M is simply connected, then a special generic map
f : M → R3 can be lifted to an embedding into Rn+1 if and only if the
normal bundle ν f of the singular point set of f in M is trivial as a vector
bundle. Second, we prove that for a special generic map f : M → R3 of
a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold M, if n ≥ 5, k ≥ (3n + 3)/2
and ν f is trivial, then f can be lifted to an embedding into Rk.

1. Introduction

Haeﬂiger [8] proved that for a generic smooth map f

: M → R2 of a
closed surface, there exists an immersion F : M → R3 such that f = π ◦ F
for the standard projection π : R3 → R2 if and only if the number of cusps
on each component C of the singular point set of f is even or odd according
as the tubular neighborhood of C in M is orientable or non-orientable. Here,
a smooth map f : M → R2 is generic if it has only fold points and cusp
points as its singularities. In particular, not every generic smooth map can
be so lifted.

Based on Haeﬂiger’s result mentioned above, let us consider the follow-
ing problem: “Given a smooth map f : M → Rp of a closed n-dimensional
manifold and an integer k with k > n ≥ p, determine whether or not f can
be factorized as f = π ◦ F for an immersion or embedding F : M → Rk and
for the standard projection π : Rk → Rp.” Such a non-singular map F is
called a lift of f . We can consider F as a desingularization of f . This lifting
problem has been studied in various situations.

Yamamoto [19] proved that a generic smooth map of a closed surface
into R2 can always be lifted to an embedding into R4. Saito [16] proved that
: M → Rn of a closed orientable n-dimensional
a special generic map f
manifold can always be lifted to an immersion into Rn+1. Here, special
generic maps are smooth maps with only deﬁnite fold points as their sin-
gularities. Blank and Curley [1] studied the condition for a generic smooth
map f : M → N between smooth manifolds of the same dimension to be

lifted to an immersion into a line bundle π : E → N. Note that these re-
sults concern the desingularization of generic maps between manifolds of
the same dimension.

Let us recall the deﬁnition of a special generic map. A smooth map f :
M → Rp of a closed n-dimensional manifold with n ≥ p is called a special
generic map if it has only deﬁnite fold points as its singularities (for details,
see Section 2). Note that a special generic map into the line is nothing but a
Morse function with only critical points of minimum or maximum indices;
in particular, the source manifold of such a map is homeomorphic to the
sphere if it is connected.

Special generic maps were ﬁrst deﬁned by Burlet and de Rham [3], who
showed that a closed 3-dimensional manifold M admits a special generic
map into the plane if and only if M is diﬀeomorphic to the 3-sphere or to
the connected sum of a ﬁnite number of total spaces of S 2-bundles over
S 1. Porto and Furuya [12] studied the condition for a closed n-dimensional
manifold M to admit a special generic map into the plane. Saeki [13] proved
that a closed n-dimensional manifold M with n ≥ 3 admits a special generic
map into the plane if and only if M is diﬀeomorphic to the n-dimensional
homotopy sphere (n-dimensional standard sphere for n ≤ 6) or to the con-
nected sum of a ﬁnite number of total spaces of homotopy (n − 1)-sphere
bundles ((n −1)-sphere bundles for n ≤ 6) over S 1 and a homotopy n-sphere
(for n ≥ 7).

`Eliaˇsberg [7] proved that a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold ad-
mits a special generic map into Rn if and only if M is stably parallelizable,
that is, the Whitney sum of the tangent bundle of M and the trivial line
bundle over M is trivial as a vector bundle.

Let us now return to the lifting problem. Let us ﬁrst review some results
about the lifting problem for smooth functions. Burlet and Haab [4] proved
that a Morse function f : M → R of a closed surface can always be lifted to
an immersion into R3. Saeki and Takase [15] proved that a special generic
map f : M → R of a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold with n ≥
1 can always be lifted to an immersion into Rn+1. They also proved that
a special generic map f
: M → R of a closed connected n-dimensional
manifold with n ≥ 2 can be lifted to an embedding into Rn+1 if and only if
M is diﬀeomorphic to the n-dimensional sphere with the standard smooth
structure. Yamamoto [20] gave a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a
Morse function on the circle to be lifted to an embedding into R2.

Let us now review some results about the lifting problem for smooth
maps into the plane. Kushner, Levine and Porto [10] studied the lift-
ing problem for generic smooth maps of 3-dimensional manifolds into R2.
Levine [11] gave a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a generic smooth
map f : M → R2 of a closed orientable 3-dimensional manifold to be lifted
to an immersion into R4. Saeki and Takase [15] proved that a special generic
map f : M → R2 of a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold with n ≥ 2
can always be lifted to an immersion into Rn+1. They also proved that a

DESINGULARIZING SPECIAL GENERIC MAPS INTO 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE

special generic map f : M → R2 of a closed non-orientable n-dimensional
manifold with n ≥ 2 can be lifted to an immersion into Rn+1 if and only if
n = 2, 4 or 8, and the tubular neighborhood of the singular point set in M is
orientable. On the other hand, they also proved that a special generic map
f : M → R2 of a closed connected n-dimensional manifold with n ≥ 3 can
be lifted to an embedding into Rn+1 if and only if M is diﬀeomorphic either
to S n or to the connected sum of a ﬁnite number of copies of S 1 × S n−1.
Note that this result does not hold for n = 2. Actually, in [15], it is proved
that there exists a special generic map f : S 2 → R2 which cannot be lifted
to any embedding F : S 2 → R3 (but which can be lifted to an immersion
F : S 2 → R3, since S 2 is orientable).

When n − p = 1, Saeki and Takase [15] proved that a special generic
: M → Rp of a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold can
map f
be lifted to an immersion into Rn+1 if and only if the homology class
[S ( f )] ∈ Hp−1(M; Z) represented by S ( f ) vanishes. Here, S ( f ) is the
set of all singular points of f in M. Note that for a special generic map
: M → Rp, the Z2-homology class [S ( f )]2 ∈ Hp−1(M; Z2) is Poincar´e
f
dual to the Stiefel-Whitney class wn−p+1(M) (see [18]). Therefore, if f can
be lifted to an immersion into Rn+1, then M is spin, that is, the second
Stiefel-Whitney class w2(M) ∈ H2(M; Z2) of M vanishes.

When (n, p) = (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4) or (7, 4), Saeki and Takase [15] proved
that a special generic map f : M → Rp of a closed orientable n-dimensional
manifold can be lifted to an immersion into Rn+1 if and only if M is spin.
They also showed that one can take an embedding as a lift if (n, p) = (6, 3).
In this paper, we study the lifting problem for special generic maps of
closed n-dimensional manifolds into R3 for n ≥ 5. First, we prove that a spe-
cial generic map f : M → R3 of a closed simply connected n-dimensional
manifold M, n = 5 or 6, can be lifted to an embedding into Rn+1 if and only
if the singular point set of f has a trivial normal bundle in M. Second, we
: M → R3 of a closed orientable
show that for a special generic map f
n-dimensional manifold with n ≥ 5, the map f can be lifted an embedding
into Rk, if k ≥ (3n + 3)/2 and the normal bundle of the singular point set
S ( f ) of f in M is trivial.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review various topo-
logical properties of special generic maps. In Section 3, we give a nec-
essary condition for a special generic map to be lifted to a codimension
two immersion in terms of the normal bundle of the singular point set. In
Section 4, we construct an embedding lift F : M → Rn+1 for a special
generic map f : M → R3 of a closed simply connected n-dimensional man-
ifold (n = 5, 6) with trivial normal bundle of S ( f ) in M, by using the fact
that O(n − 2) is a deformation retract of Diﬀ(S n−3), where Diﬀ(S n−3) is the
space of all self-diﬀeomorphisms of S n−3. This last fact has been proved by
Smale [17] (n = 5) and Hatcher [9] (n = 6). By using a similar method,
we construct an embedding lift F : M → Rk for a special generic map
: M → R3 of a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold (n ≥ 5 and

k ≥ (3n + 3)/2) with trivial normal bundle of S ( f ) in M, by using the fact
that Emb(S n−3, Rk−3) is 2-connected, where Emb(S n−3, Rk−3) is the space of
all embeddings of S n−3 into Rk−3. This last fact has been proved by Budney
[2].

Throughout this paper, all manifolds and maps are of class C∞, unless
otherwise indicated. For groups G1 and G2, “G1 (cid:27) G2” means that they
are isomorphic; for smooth manifolds M1 and M2, “M1 (cid:27) M2” means that
they are diﬀeomorphic; and for vector bundles E1 and E2, “E1 (cid:27) E2” means
that they are isomorphic. The symbol Rn denotes the n-dimensional Eu-
clidean space; Dn denotes the closed unit disk in Rn; and S n denotes the
n-dimensional unit sphere in Rn+1. For a manifold M with boundary, Int M
and ∂M denote the interior and the boundary of M, respectively.

2. Preliminaries

In this section, we review several results about topological properties of
special generic maps and their Stein factorizations, which will be necessary
in the proof of our main theorems.

2.1. Special generic maps. Let f : M → Rp be a smooth map of a closed
n-dimensional manifold, n ≥ p. A point q ∈ M is called a singular point
of f if the rank of the diﬀerential d fq : TqM → T f (q)Rp is strictly less
than p. We denote by S ( f ) the set of all singular points of f and call it the
singular point set of f . A point q ∈ M is called a deﬁnite fold point if there
exist local coordinates x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) around q and y = (y1, y2, . . . , yp)
around f (q) such that

( yi ◦ f = xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ p − 1,

yp ◦ f = x2

p + x2

p+1 + · · · + x2
n.

When f has no singular points except for deﬁnite fold points, f is called a
special generic map.

When p = 1, special generic maps are nothing but Morse functions with

only critical points of indices 0 or n.

Note that for a special generic map f : M → Rp, the singular point set
S ( f ) is a closed (p − 1)-dimensional submanifold of M and the restriction
of f to S ( f ) is a codimension one immersion into Rp.

2.2. Stein factorization. Let f
: X → Y be a continuous map between
topological spaces. For two points x1 and x2 in X, we deﬁne x1 ∼ x2 if x1
and x2 are in the same connected component of the pre-image f −1(y) for a
point y in Y. This relation “∼” is an equivalence relation, and therefore, we
can take the quotient space W f and the quotient map q f
: X → W f with
respect to this relation. Then it is not diﬃcult to prove that there exists a

unique continuous map ¯f : W f → Y such that the diagram

W f

❅

❅

commutes. The above diagram is called the Stein factorization of f .

In general, the quotient space in the Stein factorization of a smooth map
is not always a topological manifold. However, for a special generic map
: M → Rp of a closed n-dimensional manifold, n > p, we can give a
f
structure of a smooth p-dimensional manifold with boundary to W f so that
¯f : W f → Rp is an immersion and q f : M → W f is a smooth map.

Note that for a special generic map f

: M → Rn of a closed n-
dimensional manifold into the Euclidean space of the same dimension, we
have M = W f , since the pre-image f −1(y) is a ﬁnite set for any y ∈ Rn. So
the Stein factorization does not give any new information. The following
result is very useful to study special generic maps (see [3, 13]).

: M → Rp be a special generic map of a closed
Theorem 2.1. Let f
connected n-dimensional manifold M into Rp, n > p. Then the following
holds.

(1) The quotient space W f has the structure of a smooth p-dimensional

manifold with non-empty boundary.

(2) The map q f : M → W f is a smooth map.
(3) The map ¯f : W f → Rp is a smooth immersion.
(4) The singular point set S ( f ) is a closed (p − 1)-dimensional subman-
ifold of M, and the restriction of q f to S ( f ) is a diﬀeomorphism onto
∂W f .

(5) The induced map (q f )∗ : π1(M) → π1(W f ) is a group isomorphism.
(6) We have q f (M \ S ( f )) = Int W f and q f |M\S ( f ) : M \ S ( f ) → Int W f

is a smooth S n−p-bundle over Int W f .

The above theorem is essentially proved for (n, p) = (3, 2) in [3]. We can

prove it for general (n, p), n > p, by using a similar method.

We say that a Dn-bundle (or an S n-bundle) is linear if its structure group
can be reduced to the orthogonal group O(n). Saeki [13] proved the follow-
ing theorem about the topology of the source manifolds of special generic
maps.

Theorem 2.2. Suppose a closed n-dimensional manifold M admits a spe-
cial generic map into Rp with n > p. Then there exists a topological Dn−p+1-
bundle E over W f with M being homeomorphic to ∂E. Furthermore, if
n − p ≤ 3, then we can arrange so that E is a linear Dn−p+1-bundle over W f
and that M is diﬀeomorphic to ∂E.

By using Theorem 2.2, Saeki [13, 14] classiﬁes the diﬀeomorphism types
of the simply connected n-dimensional manifolds (n = 5, 6) which admit
special generic maps into R3. That is, the following result holds.

Theorem 2.3. Let M be a closed simply connected n-dimensional manifold
with n = 5, 6. Then M admits a special generic map into R3 if and only if
M is diﬀeomorphic to S n or to the connected sum of S n−2-bundles over S 2.

3. Normal bundle of the singular point set

In this section, we give a necessary condition for a special generic map
f : M → Rp of a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold M with n > p
to be lifted to a codimension two immersion.

Proposition 3.1. Let M be a closed orientable manifold of dimension n and
let F be an immersion of M into Rn+2 such that f = π◦F is a special generic
map, where π : Rn+2 → Rp is the standard projection, n > p ≥ 1. Then the
normal bundle ν f of S ( f ) in M is stably trivial. Furthermore, if n > 2p − 2,
then ν f is trivial.

Here, a vector bundle E over a topological space B is said to be stably
trivial if the Whitney sum of E and a ﬁnite dimensional trivial vector bundle
over B is trivial as a vector bundle.

Proof of Proposition 3.1. Let i∗(T M) be the pullback of T M induced by the

subbundle of i∗(T M).

On the other hand, since ¯f

inclusion map i : S ( f ) → M and letei : i∗(T M) → T M be the natural map
over i. Then ν f is identiﬁed with ker(d f ◦ei), which is an (n − p + 1)-plane

: W f → Rp is an immersion of a p-
dimensional manifold and q f |S ( f )
is a diﬀeomorphism,
we have that S ( f ) is orientable. Therefore, since M is orientable and
i∗(T M) (cid:27) T S ( f ) ⊕ ν f , we have that ν f is orientable.

: S ( f ) → ∂W f

Let G be the restriction of dF ◦ei to ν f . Since f = π ◦ F and F is an

immersion, G is a ﬁberwise monomorphism of the (n − p + 1)-plane bundle
ν f into the (n − p + 2)-plane bundle ker(dπ), which is trivial. Note that
G is a bundle morphism over F ◦ i. Therefore, ν f is a subbundle of ζ =
(F ◦ i)∗(ker(dπ)). By using an inner product on ζ, we ﬁnd a 1-dimensional
subbundle ξ of ζ such that ν f ⊕ ξ (cid:27) ζ. Since ν f is an orientable (n − p + 1)-
plane bundle and ζ is the trivial (n − p + 2)-plane bundle, we have that ξ is
an orientable line bundle and hence is trivial. This means that ν f is stably
trivial.

Furthermore, if n > 2p − 2, i.e. if n − p + 1 > p − 1, then the dimension
of the base space of ν f is strictly less than the dimension of the ﬁbers of
ν f . Therefore, the stable triviality of ν f implies the triviality of ν f . This
completes the proof.

4. Lifting problems for special generic maps

In this section, we consider the problem of lifting special generic maps
into R3 to codimension one embeddings. Recall that if n = 5 or 6, a closed
simply connected n-dimensional manifold M admits a special generic map
f : M → R3 if and only if M is diﬀeomorphic to S n or to the connected sum
of S n−2-bundles over S 2 (see Theorem 2.3). Now we prove the following
theorem.

Theorem 4.1. Let f : M → R3 be a special generic map of a closed simply
connected n-dimensional manifold, n = 5 or 6, such that the singular point
set S ( f ) of f has trivial normal bundle in M. Then there exists an embed-
ding F : M → W f × Rn−2 such that P ◦ F = q f , where P : W f × Rn−2 → W f
is the projection to the ﬁrst factor.

We use the following terminologies in the proof of Theorem 4.1.

Deﬁnition 4.2. Let X, Y and Z be smooth manifolds and let f : X → Y,
F : X → Z and P : Z → Y be smooth maps. We say that F is a lift of f
with respect to P if f = P ◦ F. In this case, we also say that f is lifted to F
with respect to P.

Proof of Theorem 4.1. We may assume that M is connected. Then, by The-
orem 2.1, the quotient space W f has the structure of a smooth compact
simply connected 3-dimensional manifold with non-empty boundary, since
M is simply connected. By the solution to the Poincar´e conjecture, this
implies that W f is diﬀeomorphic to the 3-manifold obtained by removing
the interior of the union of mutually disjoint ﬁnitely many 3-balls from the
3-sphere.

So we have a handle decomposition of W f as follows:

W f = (∂W f × [0, 1]) ∪  s[i=1

i! ∪ h3,

h1

where h1
i , i = 1, 2, . . . , s, are 1-handles and h3 is a 3-handle. Let C (= ∂W f ×
[0, 1]) be the collar neighborhood of ∂W f in W f , where ∂W f corresponds to
∂W f × {0}.

Fix orientations of M and R3. Since ¯f : W f → R3 is an immersion, we
can orient W f in such a way that ¯f is orientation preserving. Then, for each
w ∈ Int W f , we can orient q−1
f (w)((cid:27) S n−3) in such a way that if U is a small
open neighborhood of w in Int W f , and φ : q−1
f (w) is a local
trivialization with φ(x) = (w, x) for every x ∈ q−1
f (w), then φ is orientation
preserving, where the orientations of q−1
f (U) and U are induced from those
of M and W f , respectively.

f (U) → U × q−1

By the assumption that S ( f ) has trivial normal bundle in M, the compo-

sition of the restriction q f |q−1

is a trivial Dn−2-bundle. Therefore, we have a bundle trivialization

HC : q−1

f (C) → ∂W f × Dn−2.

We ﬁx an orientation of Rn−2, which induces an orientation for Dn−2. Then,
it induces an orientation for S n−3 = ∂Dn−2. We may assume that the re-
striction of HC to q−1
f (w) is an orientation preserving diﬀeomorphism onto
{w′} × S n−3 for every w ∈ ∂W f × {1}, where w′ is the point in ∂W f such that
w = (w′, 1). Then the map

e1 : q−1

f (C) → C × Rn−2

deﬁned by e1(x) = (q f (x), pr2 ◦ HC(x)), x ∈ q−1
the map

f (C), is a smooth map, where

pr2 : ∂W f × Dn−2 → Dn−2 ⊂ Rn−2

is the projection to the second factor.

Note that e1 is an embedding lift of q f |q−1

f (C) with respect to the restriction
of P to C × Rn−2. This is proved as follows.
It is clear that e1 is a lift
f (C) with respect to P|C×Rn−2 by the construction of e1. Therefore, we
of q f |q−1
have only to prove that e1 is an embedding. Note that the following diagram
commutes:

maps (x, y) to (x, K(x, y), y) for every x ∈ ∂W f and y ∈ Dn−2, where K is a
smooth map of ∂W f × Dn−2 into [0, 1]. This implies that e1 is an embedding.

equivalent to SO(n − 2), which is connected.

where X = (D2 × {−1, +1}) ∪ ({0} × D1). By composing this with the natural

Now, let us extend the lift e3 to the whole W f . Since the 3-handle h3 is

contractible, we have a bundle trivialization

H3 : q−1

f (h3) → h3 × S n−3

which induces an orientation preserving diﬀeomorphism of q−1
{w} × S n−3 for every w ∈ h3.

f (w) onto

We deﬁne the continuous map ρ1 : ∂h3 ×S n−3 → S n−3 by the composition

∂h3 × S n−3 → q−1

f (∂h3) → ∂h3 × S n−3 → S n−3,

to ∂h3 × S n−3, the second map is
where the ﬁrst map is the restriction of H−1
3
the restriction of e3 to q−1
f (∂h3), and the last map is the projection to the sec-
ond factor. Note that ρ1 induces an orientation preserving diﬀeomorphism
of {w} × S n−3 onto S n−3 for every w ∈ ∂h3.

Recall that Diﬀ+(S n−3) is homotopy equivalent to SO(n − 2) (see [9, 17]);
hence, it is 2-connected. Therefore, the continuous map ρ1 extends to a con-
tinuous map ρ2 : h3 × S n−3 → S n−3 which induces an orientation preserving
diﬀeomorphism of {w} × S n−3 onto S n−3 for every w ∈ h3. Then a smooth
approximation ρ3 : h3 × S n−3 → S n−3 of ρ2 such that ρ3|∂h3×S n−3 = ρ2|∂h3×S n−3
induces a diﬀeomorphism of {w} × S n−3 onto S n−3 for every w ∈ h3. So we
have a smooth homeomorphism

ρ4 : h3 × S n−3 → h3 × S n−3

given by ρ4(x, y) = (x, ρ3(x, y)) for x ∈ h3 and y ∈ S n−3.

Since the derivative of ρ4 at each point is a linear isomorphism, by the
inverse function theorem, we have that ρ4 is a diﬀeomorphism. Then the
composition

e4 : q−1

f (h3)(= h3 × S n−3) → h3 × S n−3 → h3 × Rn−2

f (h3) with respect to the restriction of P to h3 ×
is an embedding lift of q f |q−1
Rn−2, where the ﬁrst map is ρ4 and the second map is the product of the
identity map of h3 and the standard inclusion. Since e3 and e4 coincide on
the intersection of their sources, by gluing the two maps e3 and e4, we have
an embedding lift of q f with respect to P. This completes the proof.
Remark 4.3. Note that the key ingredient in the proof of Theorem 4.1 is
that π2Diﬀ+(S n−3) = 0 for n = 5, 6. On the other hand, Crowley–Schick [6]
proved that for every j ≥ 1, we have

(cid:3)

π2Diﬀ(D8 j−1, ∂) , 0,

where Diﬀ(D8 j−1, ∂) is the space of diﬀeomorphisms of D8 j−1 which are the
identity on some neighborhood of ∂D8 j−1. It is known (see Proposition 4
of Appendix in [5], for example) that the following homotopy equivalence
holds:

Diﬀ+(S n) ≃ Diﬀ(Dn, ∂) × SO(n + 1).

Therefore, the result mentioned above implies that

π2(Diﬀ+(S 8 j−1)) , 0,

DESINGULARIZING SPECIAL GENERIC MAPS INTO 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE

11

for every j ≥ 1. This means that the method in the proof of Theorem 4.1
does not work in higher dimensions in general.

As a consequence of Theorem 4.1, we have the following result.

Theorem 4.4. Let f : M → R3 be a special generic map of a closed simply
connected n-dimensional manifold with n = 5, 6 and let π : Rn+1 → R3 be
the standard projection. Then the following conditions are all equivalent to
each other:

(1) There exists an embedding F1 : M → Rn+1 such that π ◦ F1 = f .
(2) There exists an immersion F2 : M → Rn+1 such that π ◦ F2 = f .
(3) The singular point set S ( f ) of f has a trivial normal bundle in M.
(4) The manifold M is spin.

Proof. Assume that there exists an immersion F : M → Rn+1 such that
π ◦ F = f . Then the map F ′ : M → Rn+1 × R deﬁned by F ′(x) = (F(x), 0),
x ∈ M, is also an immersion lift of f . Therefore, by Proposition 3.1, we
conclude that the singular point set S ( f ) of f has a trivial normal bundle in
M.

Now, suppose that S ( f ) has a trivial normal bundle in M. Then by Theo-
rem 4.1, we get an embedding lift e : M → W f ×Rn−2 of q f . Since W f can be
embedded into Rn−2, by using an embedding ¯e : W f → Rn−2 and the immer-
sion ¯f : W f → R3, we get an embedding G = ( ¯f , ¯e) : W f → Rn+1 such that
G is an embedding lift of ¯f with respect to the natural projection Rn+1 → R3.
Since W f is compact, there exists an embedding H : W f × Rn−2 → Rn+1 such
that H(x, 0) = G(x) for every x ∈ W f and the diagram

W f × Rn−2

H /

/ Rn+1

commutes. Then the composition of e with H is an embedding lift of f .

It is trivial that the ﬁrst condition implies the second one. Thus, the ﬁrst

three conditions in Theorem 4.4 are equivalent to each other.

Saeki–Takase proved that the second and the last conditions are equiva-
lent to each other (see Theorem 6.1 in [15]). This completes the proof of
Theorem 4.4.

(cid:3)

Remark 4.5. Note that we can directly prove that items 3 and 4 in Theorem
4.4 are equivalent to each other without using a result of Saeki–Takase [15]
as follows. Recall that M is diﬀeomorphic to ∂E for some linear Dn−2-
bundle E over W f by Theorem 2.2. Since W f is simply connected, we have

W f (cid:27) W1♮W2♮ · · · ♮Wb,

where the symbol “♮” denotes boundary connected sum, Wi (cid:27) S 2 × [0, 1]
(i = 1, 2, . . . , b) and b ≥ 0 (when b = 0, W f (cid:27) D3). Let Ei (i = 1, 2, . . . , b)

be the Dn−2-bundle over Wi induced from the inclusion Wi ֒→ W f . Then,
we have

M (cid:27) ∂E1 ♯ ∂E2 ♯ · · · ♯ ∂Eb.

Note that the manifold ∂Ei is the total space of an S n−2-bundle over S 2.
This is a spin manifold if and only if the bundle Ei is trivial. Therefore, the
manifold M is spin if and only if all the bundles Ei are trivial. Finally, it is
easy to see that this last condition is equivalent to the triviality of the normal
bundle ν f of S ( f ) in M.

The following proposition shows that for n ≥ 4, there exist special
generic maps of closed simply connected n-dimensional manifolds into R3
with trivial normal bundle of the singular point set. By virtue of Theo-
rem 4.4, such special generic maps for n = 5, 6 can be lifted to embeddings
in codimension one.

Proposition 4.6. For n ≥ 3, there is a special generic map f : S n−2 × S 2 →
R3 such that the normal bundle ν f of S ( f ) in S n−2 × S 2 is trivial.
Proof. Let h : S n−2 → R be the Morse function given by

for (x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) ∈ S n−2 ⊂ Rn−1. Then the composition

h(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = xn−1

S n−2 × S 2 h×id

−−−→ R × S 2 → R3

is a special generic map, where id is the identity map of S 2, and the last
map is the composition of a trivialization of the open tubular neighborhood
of S 2 in R3 with the inclusion map. Note that S ( f ) = {(0, 0, . . . , 0, ±1)} × S 2
is the disjoint union of two 2-spheres and it has trivial normal bundle in
S n−2 × S 2.

(cid:3)

On the other hand, the following proposition implies that there exist spe-
cial generic maps of closed simply connected n-dimensional manifolds into
R3 with non-trivial normal bundle of the singular point set. By virtue of
Theorem 4.4, such special generic maps for n = 5, 6 cannot be lifted to
embeddings in codimension one.

Proposition 4.7. For n ≥ 4, there is a special generic map f : M → R3
such that the normal bundle ν f of S ( f ) in M is non-trivial, where M is a
non-trivial S n−2-bundle over S 2.

Proof. For real numbers t with 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π, we deﬁne the diﬀeomorphism
gt : S n−2 → S n−2 by
gt(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = (x1 cos t − x2 sin t, x1 sin t + x2 cos t, x3, x4, . . . , xn−1)
for (x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) ∈ S n−2. Note that we have g0 = g2π. By using this map,
we deﬁne the diﬀeomorphism Φ : S n−2 × ∂D2 → S n−2 × ∂D2 by

Φ(x, (cos t, sin t)) = (gt(x), (cos t, sin t))

DESINGULARIZING SPECIAL GENERIC MAPS INTO 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE

13

for x ∈ S n−2 and 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Pasting S n−2 × D2 and its copy along the
boundary by Φ, we obtain the closed n-dimensional manifold M. It is easy
to see that M is a non-trivial S n−2-bundle over S 2.

Now, we deﬁne the special generic map h : S n−2 → R by

for (x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) ∈ S n−2. Then we have

h(x1, x2, . . . , xn−1) = xn−1

(h × id) ◦ Φ = h × id : S n−2 × ∂D2 → R × ∂D2.

Therefore, the map
(h × id) ∪ (h × id) : M = (S n−2 × D2) ∪Φ (S n−2 × D2) → (R × D2) ∪ (R × D2)
is well-deﬁned, where

(R × D2) ∪ (R × D2) = R × S 2

is the space obtained by pasting R × D2 and its copy along the boundary by
the identity map. So we obtain the composition map

f : M −→ R × S 2 → R3,

where the last map is the composition of a trivialization of the open tubular
neighborhood of S 2 in R3 with the inclusion map. Since the second Stiefel-
Whieney class of ν f does not vanish, we see that the map f : M → R3 is
a special generic map and that S ( f ) is the disjoint union of two 2-spheres
with non-trivial normal bundle in M

(cid:3)

The map f in the following proposition cannot be lifted to an embedding
into Rn+1 by a result in [15]. So Theorems 4.1 and 4.4 do not hold if we
drop the condition that M should be simply connected.

Proposition 4.8. For n = 5, 6, there exists a special generic map f : M →
R3 of a closed orientable n-dimensional manifold M such that the normal
bundle ν f of S ( f ) in M is trivial and that M is neither spin nor simply
connected.
Proof. Let π1 : E1 → S 2 be the projection of the non-trivial orientable linear
Dn−2-bundle over S 2 (such a bundle uniquely exists up to isomorphism since
π1(SO(n − 2)) = Z2). Then the product map π2 = π1 × idS 1 : E1 × S 1 →
S 2 × S 1 is a non-trivial orientable linear Dn−2-bundle over S 2 × S 1. Set
W = S 2 × S 1 \ Int D1, E = π−1
2 (W) and π = π2|E : E → W, where D1 is a
3-ball in S 2 × S 1. Then, π : E → W is a non-trivial orientable linear Dn−2-
bundle over W. It is clear that W can be immersed in R3. Then, by using the
same method used in the proof of [13, Proposition 2.1], we can construct
: M → R3 such that M = ∂E, W f = W and
a special generic map f
q f : M → W f coincide with π over q−1
f (C) for some collar neighborhood C
of ∂W f in W f . Note that the normal bundle ν f of S ( f ) in M is trivial, since
π : E → W is trivial over ∂W. This completes the proof.

(cid:3)

The following theorem is proved by a method similar to that used in the

proofs of Theorems 4.1 and 4.4.

Theorem 4.9. Let f
orientable n-dimensional manifold, n ≥ 5. Then the quotient map q f
:
M → W f lifts to an embedding into W f × Rk−3 with respect to the projection
P : W f × Rk−3 → W f if the normal bundle ν f of the singular point set S ( f )
in M is trivial and k ≥ (3n + 3)/2.

We need the following proposition to prove Theorem 4.9.

Proposition 4.10 (Budney, [2]). The embedding space Emb(S n, Rk) is
min{2k − 3n − 4, k − n − 2}-connected if k ≥ n + 2 ≥ 3.

Proof of Theorem 4.9. By Proposition 4.10, since k ≥ (3n + 3)/2 and n ≥ 5,
we have that the embedding space Emb(S n−3, Rk−3) is 2-connected. This is
a key to proving Theorem 4.9.

We may assume that M is connected. Then, by Theorem 2.1, the quo-
tient space W f has the structure of a smooth compact orientable connected
3-dimensional manifold with non-empty boundary. So we have a handle
decomposition of W f as follows:

W f = (∂W f × [0, 1]) ∪  s[i=1

j! ∪ h3,

h2

i , i = 1, 2, . . . , s, are 1-handles, h2

where h1
j, j = 1, 2, . . . , t, are 2-handles,
and h3 is a 3-handle. Let C(= ∂W f × [0, 1]) be the collar neighborhood of
∂W f in W f . Here, ∂W f corresponds to ∂W f × {0}.

By using the same method used in the proof of Theorem 4.1, we can

construct an embedding lift e1 of q f |q−1

f (C) with respect to P|C×Rk−3.

We will extend e1 to an embedding lift of the restriction of q f to q−1

embedding into Rk−3 on each S n−3-ﬁber. Then a smooth approximation ρ3 :
h3 × S n−3 → Rk−3 of ρ2 such that ρ3|∂h3×S n−3 = ρ2|∂h3×S n−3 induces a smooth

DESINGULARIZING SPECIAL GENERIC MAPS INTO 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE

embedding on each S n−3-ﬁber, since so does ρ2. So we have a smooth
injection

ρ4 : h3 × S n−3 → h3 × Rk−3

deﬁned by ρ4(x, y) = (x, ρ3(x, y)) for x ∈ h3 and y ∈ S n−3.

Since the derivative of ρ4 at each point is injective and h3 × S n−3 is com-
pact, we have that ρ4 is a smooth embedding. Put e6 = ρ4. Then, since e5
and e6 coincide on the intersection of their sources, by gluing the two maps
e5 and e6, we have an embedding lift of q f with respect to P. This completes
the proof.

As a consequence of Theorem 4.9, by using the same method as that in

the proof of Theorem 4.4, we have the following result.

: M → R3 be a special generic map of a closed
Theorem 4.11. Let f
orientable n-dimensional manifold, n ≥ 5. Then f lifts to an embedding
into Rk with respect to the natural projection π : Rk → R3 if the normal
bundle ν f of the singular point set S ( f ) in M is trivial and k ≥ (3n + 3)/2.

Furthermore, Theorem 4.11 can be generalized as follows.

: M → Rp be a special generic map of a closed
Theorem 4.12. Let f
orientable n-dimensional manifold with n > p ≥ 1. Then f lifts to an
embedding into Rk with respect to the natural projection π : Rk → Rp
if the normal bundle ν f of the singular point set S ( f ) in M is trivial and
k ≥ max{(3n + 3)/2, n + p + 1}.

This is proved by the (almost) same method as that in the proofs of The-
orems 4.9 and 4.11. The key ingredient to proving Theorem 4.12 is that
Emb(S n−p, Rk−p) is (p − 1)-connected.
