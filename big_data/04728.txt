ABSTRACT

We present results based on observations of SN 2015H which belongs to the small group of objects similar to SN 2002cx, otherwise
known as type Iax supernovae. The availability of deep pre-explosion imaging allowed us to place tight constraints on the explosion
epoch. Our observational campaign began approximately one day post-explosion, and extended over a period of about 150 days post
maximum light, making it one of the best observed objects of this class to date. We ﬁnd a peak magnitude of Mr = −17.27±0.07, and a
(∆m15)r = 0.69±0.04. Comparing our observations to synthetic spectra generated from simulations of deﬂagrations of Chandrasekhar
mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, we ﬁnd reasonable agreement with models of weak deﬂagrations that result in the ejection of
∼0.2 M(cid:12) of material containing ∼0.07 M(cid:12) of 56Ni. The model light curve however, evolves more rapidly than observations, suggesting
that a higher ejecta mass is to be favoured. Nevertheless, empirical modelling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve suggests that
(cid:46)0.6 M(cid:12) of material was ejected, implying that the white dwarf is not completely disrupted, and that a bound remnant is a likely
outcome.

1. Introduction
The use of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as standardizable can-
dles and cosmological distance indicators (Perlmutter et al.
1999; Riess et al. 1998) has meant that they are among the
best studied transient phenomena in the Universe. In spite of
this however, identifying the nature of the underlying progen-
itor system(s) remains a key challenge. While it is generally
agreed that SNe Ia result from the thermonuclear explosion of
a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD), the explosion mech-
anism and scenarios leading to explosion remain unclear (e.g.
Hillebrandt et al. 2013). During the course of transient surveys,
some of which are dedicated to searching for SNe Ia, many pe-

(cid:63) E-mail: mmagee37@qub.ac.uk

culiar transients have been discovered. A small subset of these
show similarities to SNe Ia, but also striking diﬀerences. If these
also result from thermonuclear explosions, then they may prove
to be an excellent opportunity to test the extreme boundaries of
explosion models.

One such class of peculiar SNe Ia are the SN 2002cx-like ob-
jects, that have recently been dubbed ‘SNe Iax’ (Li et al. 2003;
Foley et al. 2013). The ﬁrst examples of this group included
SN 2002cx which was immediately recognized as being diﬀerent
from SNe Ia (Li et al. 2003). A few years later, it was followed by
SN 2005hk (Phillips et al. 2007). Both objects showed similari-
ties to each other, but diverged from usual SNe Ia behaviour. A
subsequent search yielded ∼25 objects that were deemed to ex-
hibit properties in common with SNe 2002cx and 2005hk (Foley

et al. 2013). This sample contains some very well observed SNe
Iax such as SN 2012Z, for which a pre-explosion point source
coincident with the supernova (McCully et al. 2014a). However,
it also necessarily included some objects with incomplete data
sets. The main observational properties that link SNe Iax in-
clude slow expansion velocities – roughly half that of normal
SNe Ia at similar epochs, – spectra that are dominated by inter-
mediate mass (IME) and iron-group elements (IGE) (Li et al.
2003; Branch et al. 2004), and peak absolute brightnesses that
span about ﬁve magnitudes: (−14 (cid:38) MV (cid:38) −19; Li et al. 2003;
Branch et al. 2004; Foley et al. 2009, 2013).

Despite the fact that SNe Iax are generally sub-luminous
compared to normal1 SNe Ia, their early-time spectra (i.e., be-
fore or around maximum light), are intriguingly similar to those
of over-luminous SNe Ia such as SN 1991T (Filippenko et al.
1992). Indeed, the prototypical member of the SN Iax class,
SN 2002cx, exhibited features of Fe iii in pre-maximum spectra
(Li et al. 2003), similar to SN 1991T-like objects (Li et al. 1999).
Spectral features due to Si ii, S ii, and Ca ii, that are prominent in
the spectra of normal SNe Ia, have been shown to be present in
SNe Iax (Branch et al. 2004). However, it is at later epochs still,
that the diﬀerences between SNe Ia and the SNe Iax become
most pronounced. While spectra of the former are dominated by
forbidden emission lines of IGEs, spectra of the latter exhibit
a forest of permitted lines from IGEs. This may indicate that
the ejecta density is higher compared to SNe Ia at comparable
epochs (Sahu et al. 2008).

Given that SNe Iax diﬀer markedly in their properties when
compared to SNe Ia, alternative explosion mechanisms, and/or
progenitor systems are probably necessary. A possible explosion
model for SNe Iax that has been widely considered since the
early discoveries is that of pure deﬂagrations of white dwarfs
(Branch et al. 2004; Phillips et al. 2007). These models diﬀer
from contemporary explosion models proposed for normal SNe
Ia in that they do not involve a detonation phase (Hillebrandt
& Niemeyer 2000). Deﬂagration models could naturally explain
some of the observed aspects of SNe Iax such as their lower
kinetic energy and lower luminosity compared to normal SNe
Ia.

Indeed, synthetic observables obtained from deﬂagration
models presented by Fink et al. (2014), Kromer et al. (2013,
2015), and Long et al. (2014) have shown broad agreement with
SNe Iax observables at early times. Nevertheless, the models di-
verge from observations at later times, indicating that we are
missing key pieces in the puzzle that are the SNe Iax. Alternative
models to pure deﬂagrations have also been proposed for SNe
Iax; in particular Stritzinger et al. (2015) have shown good agree-
ment for a pulsational delayed detonation model with a bright
SN Iax, SN 2012Z. In the context of such models, the range in
parameter space spanned by the observations may be attributed
to variations in a combination of the details of the ignition as
well as inherent diversity in the progenitor systems. It neverthe-
less remains to be seen whether a single class of model is able to
account for the full brightness range spanned by SNe Iax.

We also note in passing that non-thermonuclear explosion
scenarios have also been invoked for SNe Iax, in particular, for
SN 2008ha. The apparent similarities between SN 2008ha, and
some faint core-collapse (II-Plateau) SNe has led to suggestions
of a core-collapse origin (Valenti et al. 2009; Moriya et al. 2010),
usually attributed to stars more massive than ∼8 M(cid:12). Neverthe-
less, the undisputed presence of spectral lines due to hydrogen in

mately one week post r–band maximum with the LCOGT (Table
A.4). The position of SN 2015H is indicated by red dashes, and

brate the LCOGT imaging.

these type II-Plateau SNe, and the conspicuous absence of these
in SNe Iax, including SN 2008ha, poses problems for this sce-
nario. Recent studies that have considered the location of SNe
Iax within their host galaxies have shown that SNe Iax tend to
favour late-type galaxies with higher local star formation rates,
which could indicate that they result from younger stars (Ly-
man et al. 2013). Some progenitor channels involving WDs in
binary systems are, however, consistent with the relatively young
ages inferred for SNe Iax progenitors (Wang et al. 2014; Kromer
et al. 2015) implying that environmental factors alone cannot
be used as a discriminating factor. In what follows, we do not
consider the core-collapse scenario further, but focus our discus-
sion around thermonuclear explosions, speciﬁcally that of a pure
delfagration of a CO white dwarf.

In what follows, we begin by presenting our observations of
SN 2015H. In §3.2 and §3.3, we present our analysis of the pho-
tometric and spectroscopic evolution, respectively. We compare
our data with two well-observed SNe Iax in §4, and to deﬂagra-
tion models involving Chandrasekhar mass CO WDs in §5. We
summarize our ﬁndings in §6.

1.1. SN 2015H
One of the most recent additions to the SN Iax class is SN 2015H
(also known as LSQ15mv; Parker 2015). SN 2015H was discov-
ered in an unﬁltered CCD image as part of the Backyard Ob-
servatory Supernova Search2 (BOSS), on 2015 Feb. 10 with an
apparent magnitude of +16.9. In Fig. 1 we show an image of

SN 2015H within its host galaxy, NGC 3464, along with se-
quence stars used to calibrate LCOGT photometry. A classiﬁ-
cation spectrum obtained by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Sur-
vey of Transient Objects (PESSTO, Smartt et al. 2015) on 2015
Feb. 11 showed SN 2015H to be a Type Iax SN approximately
a few days post-maximum light, with good matches provided
by SN 2005cc at +5 d and SN 2002cx at +10 d (Zelaya-Garcia
et al. 2015). In what follows, we adopt the distance modulus for
NGC 3464 provided by NED3 of 33.91±0.07, which is based on
the Tully-Fisher relation (Tully & Fisher 1977), and derived by
Springob et al. (2009). In Table 1 we list the basic characteristics
of SN 2015H and its host galaxy, and our derived parameters for
SN 2015H resulting from our analysis in § 3.

2. Observations & Data Reduction
2.1. Optical & near-IR imaging
A follow-up monitoring campaign for SN 2015H was initiated
immediately following the discovery by BOSS and subsequent
classiﬁcation by PESSTO. Although ﬁrst reported by BOSS,
SN 2015H had been serendipitously observed by the La Silla-
Quest Variability survey (LSQ, Baltay et al. 2013) with images
of the ﬁeld containing SN 2015H extending to approximately
three years prior to this date. Incorporating these LSQ images
into our analysis of SN 2015H, our full light curve across all
ﬁlters extends from shortly after explosion (see §3.2 for discus-
sion on the explosion date of SN 2015H) to approximately 160 d
later, making it one of the best sampled light curves to date for
SNe Iax.

Optical imaging in the gri ﬁlters was provided by the Las
Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope 1-m network (LCOGT,
Brown et al. 2013). We also include the seven V–band acqui-
sition images obtained with the 3.58-m New Technology Tele-
scope (NTT) + EFOSC2, as part of the PESSTO spectroscopic

monitoring campaign for SN 2015H. The LSQ survey makes use
of the 40-inch ESO Schmidt telescope and a ‘wide’ ﬁlter ap-
proximately covering both the SDSS g– and r–bands. This ﬁlter
function is shown in Fig. 10(e), along with standard ﬁlters. Three
epochs of dithered near-IR J– and H–band imaging were ob-
tained with NTT+SOFI, ranging from approximately one week
post-maximum to over three weeks later, while time constraints
limited us to a single Ks–band observation at one week post max-
imum.

LSQ and LCOGT images are automatically reduced using
their respective pipelines (Baltay et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2013).
NTT images were reduced using the custom-built PESSTO
pipeline Smartt et al. (2015). All of these included standard re-
duction procedures.

Photometry on all images was performed using SNOoPY4, a
custom IRAF package designed for point spread function (PSF)
ﬁtting photometry. For each image, a collection of stars in the
ﬁeld is used to build up a reference PSF. We began by subtracting
the sky background. The reference PSF was then used to subtract
the SN signal, and a new background estimate was derived from
the residual image. This process was then repeated in an iterative
fashion to ﬁnally obtain the SN magnitude. Given the availabil-
ity of pre-explosion imaging from LSQ, we opted to measure the
SN brightness from template-subtracted images. For all imaging
data, zero points were calculated by calibrating the instrumental
magnitudes of the PSF stars to either SDSS magnitudes for opti-
cal images, or 2MASS magnitudes for near-IR images. V–band
magnitudes of the sequence stars were obtained via transforma-
tions from SDSS gri (Jester et al. 2005). We transformed the
LSQ photometry directly into the SDSS r–band by calculating
zero points to SDSS r–band as a function of g − r colour. The
diﬀering ﬁelds-of-view of the instruments necessitated the use of
diﬀerent sets of sequence stars to calibrate the photometry. These
are shown in Fig. 1 for LCOGT, and listed in Tables A.1, A.2,

available both through ESO and WISeREP (Yaron & Gal-Yam
2012).

3. Analysis
3.1. Reddening
A commonly used method to estimate extinction for normal SNe
Ia relies on the expected colour evolution ("Lira relation", Lira
1996). For SNe Iax, there is currently no evidence of uniform
evolution (Foley et al. 2013), so we cannot use this technique.
We note however, that the colours of SN 2015H are relatively
blue (Fig. 3). The presence of interstellar lines due to Na i, is
another sign of material in the line-of-sight. Numerous caveats
notwithstanding, if Na i features are observed in absorption, one
can nevertheless correlate the equivalent width of these with the
extinction (Richmond et al. 1994; Munari & Zwitter 1997; Poz-
nanski et al. 2012). In the case of SN 2015H, the spectra show
no sign of the Na i D features. Taking both of the above points
together, we deem the extinction to be low, and in what follows,
we correct the data for Milky Way extinction in the direction of
NGC 3464 only. For this, we adopt the value provided by NED,
of E(B− V) = 0.048 (Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011) with RV = 3.1
(Fitzpatrick 1999).

3.2. Photometry
Fig. 2 shows the full light curve for SN 2015H. Our light curve
coverage extends from approximately two weeks before r–band
maximum (a time we estimate to be shortly after explosion) to
almost 150 days post-maximum. As described in detail below,
we are thus in the fortuitous position to be able to place con-
straints on a full set of light curve parameters: explosion epoch,
peak magnitude, epoch of maximum light, the rise time to maxi-
mum, and decline rate, which has thus far been unusual for SNe
Iax.

Beginning with our earliest images, we do not detect any
source at the site of SN 2015H in images taken on or before
MJD = 57045.14 (2015 Jan. 23) i.e., two days before our re-
ported earliest detection, and over two weeks before discovery
(2015 Feb. 10). In order to place a limit on the brightness of
SN 2015H at this epoch, we recovered the ﬂux from progres-
sively fainter artiﬁcial stars placed in the surrounding region.
We ﬁnd that SN 2015H would have had a magnitude of mr >∼
20.2 at this epoch. Studies of SNe Ia have shown that at early
times the luminosity can be described by a simple power law,
relating to time since explosion (L ∝ tn; e.g. Riess et al. 1999;
Firth et al. 2015). In order to estimate the date of explosion, we
ﬁt the pre-maximum magnitudes of SN 2015H using the simple
logarithmic function m = a log(t) + b, and ﬁnd a likely date of
MJD = 57046±0.5 (Fig. 4). This date is consistent with our non-
detection approximately one day earlier, despite the relatively
shallow limit at that epoch. Excluding later points has no eﬀect
on our derived explosion date. Following the same method as
Firth et al. (2015), we ﬁnd a rise index n of ∼1.3. This is compa-
rable to the broad range of values reported by Firth et al. (2015)
(∼1.5 to ∼3.5). Only a handful of SNe Iax have constraints on
their explosion epoch (e.g. Phillips et al. 2007; Foley et al. 2009;
Narayan et al. 2011; Yamanaka et al. 2015, for SNe 2005hk,
2008ha, 2009ku, and 2012Z, respectively), with SN 2015H be-
ing perhaps the most well-constrained to date.

in the SN magnitude are estimated by recovering the magnitudes
of artiﬁcial stars placed in the region surrounding the SN. In Ta-
bles A.4 and A.5 we present the full set of optical and IR photo-
metric observations obtained for SN 2015H, respectively. Fig. 2
shows our complete light curve.

2.2. Optical & near-IR spectroscopy
We present a log of our instrumental conﬁgurations and spec-
troscopic observations in Table A.6. We obtained seven opti-
cal spectra using NTT + EFOSC2 and three near-IR spectra
using NTT + SOFI. The spectra range from a few days post-
maximum to approximately 50 days post-maximum light. We
were also able to obtain an optical spectrum using the Gran Tele-
scopio Canarias (GTC) + OSIRIS at approximately 113 days
post-maximum light.

All NTT spectra were reduced in a standard fashion using the
PESSTO pipeline (Smartt et al. 2015). For spectroscopic data,
this includes standard procedures for ﬂux and wavelength cal-
ibration. Flux calibration is performed against a spectroscopic
standard star observed on the same night, and with the same
instrumental set-up. Our GTC spectrum was taken with Grism
R500R and reduced using standard IRAF routines. Additionally,
we estimated synthetic magnitudes from our spectra using SMS
(Synthetic Magnitudes from Spectra), as part of the S3 pack-
age (Inserra et al. in prep). All spectra are then calibrated such
that synthetic magnitudes match the photometric observations
taken on the same night. We note that all raw data taken via
the PESSTO programme on the NTT are publicly available in
the ESO archive immediately. The reduced data are released on
an annual basis in formal data releases via the Science Archive

Fig. 3: Colour evolution of SN 2015H compared to other SNe Iax
and the normal SN Ia, SN 2011fe (Richmond & Smith 2012). In
panel (a) we show the g − r colour while panel (b) shows the
r − i colour. SN 2005hk is shown assuming negligible host ex-
tinction (Foley et al. 2013). SN 2012Z and SN 2011fe have been
corrected for host extinction, with data taken from Stritzinger
et al. (2015) and Richmond & Smith (2012), respectively. Note
that the colour of SN 2011fe is derived from BVRI magnitudes
(Jester et al. 2005). Maximum refers to the date of r–band max-
imum.

To estimate the date of maximum and peak magnitude of
SN 2015H, we ﬁt the LSQ photometry with a low-order polyno-
mial (Fig. 2). From this, we estimate that SN 2015H reached
a peak absolute magnitude of Mr = −17.27±0.07 on MJD =
57061.9±0.4; placing it at an intermediate brightness among the
range displayed by SNe Iax, and approximately two magnitudes
fainter than normal SNe Ia. Phases of SNe Iax are usually given
relative to the date of either B– or V–band maximum. As we lack
observational data in these bands around maximum, throughout
this study, all references to the epoch of maximum of SN 2015H
refer to the above r–band date. Our light curves for SN 2015H
show no signs of a secondary maximum in the SDSS r– and
i–bands, consistent with what has been previously reported for
other SNe Iax (e.g. Li et al. 2003; Phillips et al. 2007).
The colour evolution of SN 2015H (in g− r and r − i) is very
similar to both SN 2005hk and SN 2012Z (Fig. 3). SN 2015H
shows an increase in g − r and r − i colour much sooner than
normal SNe Ia, similar to both SN 2005hk and SN 2012Z. In ad-
dition, SN 2015H is redder than normal SNe Ia at all observed
epochs. Beginning approximately 6 d post-maximum (the start
of our g–band coverage), SN 2015H shows a >0.5 magnitude
increase in g − r colour over a period of approximately 10 days.
After this point, the g − r colour shows a steady decrease but re-
mains redder than normal SNe Ia by at least ∼0.2 magnitudes at
all epochs. Similarly, the r − i colour of SN 2015H closely fol-
lows that of other SNe Iax; it increases slowly until a few weeks
post maximum, at which point the colour remains approximately
constant with r−i (cid:39)0.2. The r−i colours of SNe Iax do not show
the decrease and subsequent increase observed in normal SNe Ia
at early times, and are consistently redder by ∼0.2 magnitudes
after approximately 40 days post–r–band maximum.

Motivated by our well-constrained explosion epoch and
epoch of maximum light, we now investigate the rise time dis-

Fig. 4: Logarithmic ﬁt to the rise of SN 2015H. Our pre-
explosion limit is from approximately 48 hours before our ﬁrst
detection. Blue points indicate points that are not included in the

tribution of SNe Iax. For normal SNe Ia, the rise times are de-
termined by the rate at which energy is deposited by radioactive
56Ni and diﬀusion through the ejecta. Most SNe Iax, however,
are not well observed at these early epochs and therefore rise
times exist for only a few events. We determine a rise time to
r–band maximum for SN 2015H of 15.9±0.6 d. As described
below, for other SNe Iax, we either take the value of the rise
time quoted in the literature, or estimate a value based on avail-
able data. For SN 2005hk, Phillips et al. (2007) estimate that
the explosion occurred approximately 15±1 d before B–band
maximum, which was approximately one week before r–band
maximum. We therefore estimate that SN 2005hk took approxi-
mately three weeks (21.8±1.2 days) to reach r–band maximum.
Narayan et al. (2011) ﬁnd that SN 2009ku had a rise time of
18.2±3.0 d6

For SNe 2008A and 2012Z, we use the pre-maximum r–band
photometry presented in Hicken et al. (2012) and Stritzinger
et al. (2015), respectively, and ﬁnd rise times of 16.8±1.8 d
for SN 2008A, and 17.3±1.1 d for SN 2012Z, respectively.
SN 2010ae was undetected up to ﬁve days before discovery
(Stritzinger et al. 2014). Using this limit, combined with data
from Stritzinger et al. (2014), we estimate a rise time to r–band
maximum of 10±2 d. Based on limited pre-maximum detections
of SN 2007qd (McClelland et al. 2010), we estimate a rise time
to r–band maximum of 11±5 d. In addition to the above ob-
jects, we examined the unﬁltered light curve of SN 2004cs pre-
sented by Foley et al. (2013) and found a rise time of ∼9.0±1.1
days. In order to estimate the rise time of SN 2008ha, Foley et al.
(2009) stretched the light curve of SN 2005hk, and found a rise
time of ∼10 days to B–band maximum. R–band maximum oc-
curred a further four days later, and we therefore assume a rise
time for SN 2008ha of 14±1 d. Finally, we estimate rise times
to R–band maximum for PTF 09ego (23±1 days) and PTF 09eoi
(28±2 days), based on data from White et al. (2015). As shown
in Fig. 5, those SNe Iax that are brighter, tend to exhibit longer

and peak absolute magnitude for SNe Iax in the r–band. For
comparison, we also show the region occupied by a few nor-
mal SNe Ia, using the estimated explosion epochs and data from
sources listed in table A.8. There is no clear demarcation be-
tween the SNe Ia and the SNe Iax at the bright end. Note that
values shown for SN 2005cf and SN 2011fe are based on ﬁlter
transformations (Jester et al. 2005). Unﬁlled circles denote mea-
surements taken in the R–band, with the exception of SN 2004cs,
which is based on unﬁltered imaging. The data sources for all
objects are listed in table A.8. Grey crosses denote the models
discussed in § 5.

nitude for SNe Iax. As in Fig. 5, unﬁlled circles are SNe Iax
in the R–band, again with the exception of SN 2004cs, which
is based on unﬁltered imaging. Grey crosses denote the mod-
els discussed in § 5. Black points are values typical of normal

shown in Fig. 5 as they lack good pre-maximum coverage are:

rise times to peak than those that are fainter. The rise times and
peak luminosities of SNe Iax in the r–band show a range of val-
ues up to what is typical for normal SNe Ia, with PTF 09eoi
being a clear outlier.

We now turn our attention to the post-maximum evolution of
SN 2015H. In Fig. 6, we show the relation between peak mag-
nitude and decline rate observed in SNe Iax and normal SNe Ia
which has also been considered in previous studies (e.g. Narayan
et al. 2011; Foley et al. 2013; Stritzinger et al. 2014). We use the
standard deﬁnition of decline rate: i.e., the change in observed
magnitude in a given ﬁlter between maximum light and 15 d
thereafter. For SN 2015H, we ﬁnd (∆m15)r = 0.69±0.04 which
is similar to that observed in some normal SNe Ia, despite be-
ing approximately two magnitudes fainter. It is also consistent
with the roughly linear relation observed in SNe Iax (Fig. 6), al-
though PTF 09eoi is again a clear outlier, as is SN 2007qd in this
instance. Together, Figs. 5 and 6 show that SNe Iax with longer
rise times show slower decline rates, indicating that the width of
a SN Iax light curve is indeed linked with its absolute magnitude
and tied to 56Ni production.

We test whether the trends observed in Figs. 5 and 6 repre-
sent statistically signiﬁcant correlations via the use of the Pear-
son correlation coeﬃcient, which is a measure of whether a lin-
ear correlation exists between two variables. A value of ±1 rep-
resents a complete correlation, while 0 indicates no correlation.
For the decline rate versus peak absolute magnitude, we ﬁnd a
correlation coeﬃcient of 0.39 (p-value ∼0.09) when consider-
ing the entire sample. Excluding SN 2007qd and PTF 09eoi8 we

ﬁnd this value increases to 0.72 (p-value ∼0.001). For the rise
time versus peak absolute magnitude distribution of SNe Iax, we
ﬁnd a correlation coeﬃcient of −0.52 (p-value ∼0.08) when in-
cluding all objects, and −0.71 (p-value ∼0.02) if PTF 09eoi and
SN 2007qd are excluded. Thus, our ﬁndings are suggestive of the
existence of correlations between the absolute (r–band) magni-
tude of SNe Iax with both rise time and decline rate.

Using the parameters derived from our light curve, we now
seek to constrain the amount of 56Ni produced during the ex-
plosion, and the total amount of material ejected. Our maxi-
mum light coverage of SN 2015H unfortunately only includes
one ﬁlter, so we are unable to construct a bolometric light
curve. We note however, that the colour and decline rates of
SN 2015H and SN 2005hk, are very similar (see Figs. 3 and
6), and SN 2005hk has extensive pre-maximum coverage in
numerous ﬁlters. We therefore stretched the light curves of
SN 2005hk from Stritzinger et al. (2015) and scaled them to
match SN 2015H, allowing us to use these values to construct
a pseudo-bolometric light curve for SN 2015H across ugriJH
ﬁlters. Applying Arnett’s law (Arnett 1982), and the descrip-
tions provided by Stritzinger & Leibundgut (2005) and Gane-
shalingam et al. (2012), we estimated the 56Ni and ejecta masses.
By taking a peak bolometric luminosity of log(L/L(cid:12)) = 8.6, and
a rise time to bolometric maximum of ∼14.5 days, we ﬁnd that
SN 2015H produced ∼0.06 M(cid:12) of 56Ni. Using an average ejecta

worsen with time (White et al. 2015). SN 2007qd does not have spectra
beyond ∼15 d post B–band maximum (McClelland et al. 2010). Both
PTF 09eoi and SN 2007qd lie in a region of Mr vs. (∆m15)r separate
from the rest of the sample. Given the lack of data for these objects, we
are not able to make deﬁnitive statements about their nature.

Fig. 7: Spectroscopic sequence of SN 2015H. Spectra have been corrected for redshift and galactic extinction. Epochs are given
relative to maximum light at MJD = 57061.9. Regions showing strong telluric features in the NIR have been omitted. Near-IR
spectra have also been smoothed, to highlight the features present. We also highlight the features discussed in Section 3.3 and those
present throughout the spectroscopic evolution which were used for velocity measurements in Fig. 9. Arbitrary vertical oﬀsets, and
diﬀerent colours for alternating spectral phases have been used for clarity.

velocity of ∼5500 km s−1 (§3.3, Fig. 9) we estimate an ejecta
mass of ∼0.50 M(cid:12). These values are based on simple scaling
laws appropriate for normal SNe Ia. As a test of the validity of
our estimates, we used the light curve model described in Inserra
et al. (2013) to ﬁt our pseudo-bolometric light curve; we ﬁnd that
it is best matched by ∼0.06 M(cid:12) of 56Ni and ∼0.54 M(cid:12) of ejecta.
Thus, for SN 2015H, we ﬁnd our values for the 56Ni mass and
the ejecta mass to be consistent both with other estimates for
SNe Iax (see Fig. 15 of McCully et al. 2014b) and the fact that it
is of intermediate brightness among this class.

3.3. Spectroscopy

In Fig. 7 we show the full series of optical and IR spectra for
SN 2015H. Our ﬁrst spectrum is from approximately three days
post r–band maximum, while our last spectrum is 110 days later.
The spectra of SN 2015H show features typical of SNe Iax i.e.,
dominated by IGEs with line velocities lower than those typi-
cally measured in normal SNe Ia by a factor of ∼2.

In order to facilitate line identiﬁcations, we compare our
spectra to calculations made with the 1D Monte Carlo radia-
tive transfer code TARDIS9 (Kerzendorf & Sim 2014). For a
given set of input model parameters, TARDIS computes a self-
consistent description of the SN ejecta and emergent spectrum.
TARDIS is described in detail by Kerzendorf & Sim (2014),
while details of the model adopted here are discussed in Ap-
pendix B.

We note that the photospheric approximation employed by
TARDIS (i.e. a sharp boundary between optically thick and thin
regions) is often used to describe optical wavelengths and leads
to synthetic spectra in reasonable agreement to results of other,
more sophisticated, radiative transfer codes (Kerzendorf & Sim
2014). This approximation however, is limited when describ-
ing the IR regime where opacities are substantially lower. Ac-
cordingly, we limit our TARDIS comparison to optical wave-
lengths. We carry out our TARDIS modelling on our +6 d spec-
trum only: between +3 d to ∼+30 d, the spectral features show
little evolution in shape and strength, possibly indicating that

Fig. 8: In the bottom panel of this plot, we show a comparison of our model TARDIS spectrum, in blue, to a spectrum of SN 2015H,
in black, at 6 days post r–band maximum. Our TARDIS model provides good agreement with many of the features observed in
SN 2015H. In the top panel, we colour code a histogram of luminosity per wavelength bin to the atomic number of the element
responsible for the last interaction with an escaped Monte Carlo packet. Features below/above the dashed line show the relative
contribution of these elements in removing from or adding to the observed ﬂux during the simulation (based on the analysis of
interaction histories of escaping MC packets). Packets that do not experience line interactions within the SN ejecta are shown in
either black or grey. Black indicates where packets have passed through the entire model region with no interaction, while grey
packets have only experienced scattering via free electrons. Dotted vertical lines indicate features for which we measure a velocity,
(shown in Fig. 9). Dashed vertical lines show features that are discussed further in the main text.

the ejecta is well mixed; furthermore, our +6 d spectrum has a
higher signal-to-noise compared to the earlier (+3 d, classiﬁca-
tion) spectrum. Beyond epochs of ∼30 d, the assumptions inher-
ent in the TARDIS model (e.g. deﬁnition of the photosphere) are
no longer robust, so we do not attempt to model spectra taken at
these epochs.

In Fig. 8 we show a synthetic spectrum that indicates the
elements responsible for producing the main spectral features.
In order to interpret the spectrum, we show a histogram colour-
coded by the atomic number of the element responsible for the
last interaction experienced by Monte Carlo packets that escaped
from the model region (i.e., those packets that are responsible
for contributing to the emergent spectrum). Fig. 8 shows that
the synthetic spectrum is able to reproduce many of the features
observed in SN 2015H. From the colour-coded histogram, it is
clear that the spectrum is dominated by interactions with IGEs.

Below we discuss a few speciﬁc cases of elements that have been
reported in other SNe Iax.

Si ii λ6355, one of the characteristic features of normal SNe
Ia, has been reported in a number of SNe Iax (e.g. Phillips et al.
2007; McClelland et al. 2010; Stritzinger et al. 2014) at epochs
extending from pre-maximum to approximately two weeks post
V–band maximum. Other features attributed to Si have also been
reported in some SNe Iax at early times (e.g. Si iii λ4553 and Si ii
λ5972; Branch et al. 2004; Foley et al. 2010; Yamanaka et al.
2015). About two weeks post-maximum however, the Si ii fea-
tures blend with features due to Fe ii and cannot be easily dis-
tinguished (Branch et al. 2004). As our spectroscopic campaign
only began post–r–band maximum we cannot identify clear fea-
tures due to Si ii in our spectra. This is borne out in Fig. 8, where
the complex broad feature around ∼6300 Å is a likely blend of

Magee et al.: SN 2015H

Iax: SNe 2004cs10 (Foley et al. 2013) and 2007J11 (Foley et al.
2009), although whether these two objects are bona ﬁde mem-
bers of this class is contentious (White et al. 2015).

The atomic energy levels associated with the optical tran-
sitions of He i are diﬃcult to excite, so the lack of strong He i
features in optical spectra is not surprising, and does not neces-
sarily imply that it is not present in the progenitor system (e.g.
Hachinger et al. 2012). Currently, we cannot comment further
on optical features (due to the lack of a suﬃciently sophisticated
treatment of non-thermal excitation/ionization of He in our mod-
els), but we note that at the epoch under consideration, features
due to IGEs dominate the spectrum.

Strong He i transitions do exist however, at near-IR wave-
lengths e.g., the 1s2s 3S – 1s2p 3P transition at 10830 Å. Many
SNe Iax lack observations at these wavelengths; for SN 2015H,
not only do we cover this region, but our three near-IR spectra
were taken at epochs comparable to those of SN 2007J for which
the putative He i feature was reported to be growing stronger
with time (Filippenko et al. 2007b). In SN 2015H, we ﬁnd a
broad feature around ∼10700 Å, but the inferred velocities are
too low when compared with other species to plausibly identify
this feature as He i. Based on models described in §5, we ﬁnd
good agreement for this feature with Fe ii, and consider this to
be a more plausible identiﬁcation.

We estimated the ejecta velocity by ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles
to the blueshifted absorption minima of features that show mini-
mal blending. Velocities observed in SNe Iax at maximum light
range from ∼2000 km s−1 to ∼8000 km s−1 (Foley et al. 2013),
and are consistently lower than observed in normal SNe Ia by a
factor of ∼2. Fig. 9 shows the velocity evolution of SN 2015H as
measured from a selection of atomic lines that exhibit minimal
blending. These velocities show a range from ∼5000 km s−1 to
∼6000 km s−1 at approximately 3 d post-maximum. Fe ii λ6149
and λ6247 Å in particular show a roughly linear decrease from
∼5000 km s−1 to ∼1500 km s−1 over the observed time frame.
In Fig. 9, we also show the velocity evolution as measured from
Fe ii λ6149 for SNe 2002cx and 2005hk; both display higher ve-
locities than SN 2015H, which is consistent with the latter hav-
ing a slightly fainter peak absolute brightness. For the ﬁrst 50 d
post-maximum light, SN 2015H displays a velocity gradient of
∼40 km s−1 d−1. SN 2002cx and SN 2005hk show gradients of
∼45 km s−1 d−1 and ∼50 km s−1 d−1, respectively (Fig. 9 and
§4). These values are similar to those seen in low-velocity gra-
dient SNe Ia (Benetti et al. 2005).

4. Comparison with SN 2002cx and SN 2005hk
In Fig. 10 we show a selection of SN 2015 spectra spanning ∼ +6
to +113 d and compare these to two other well-observed SNe Iax
(SNe 2002cx and 2005hk) at similar epochs, with comparable
peak absolute brightnesses and decline rates.

Fig. 10 shows that many of the spectral features present in
both SN 2002cx and SN 2005hk are also present in SN 2015H.
The most noticeable diﬀerence between these objects is their ex-
pansion velocities, with SN 2015H having a slightly lower veloc-
ity (by approximately 1000 – 2000 km s−1, see Fig. 9). Indeed,
the somewhat narrower spectral features of SN 2015H allows for

10 SN 2004cs was originally classiﬁed as a SN II (Rajala et al. 2005).
11 SN 2007J was originally classiﬁed as being similar to SN 2002cx
(Filippenko et al. 2007a). The subsequent development of He i features
caused this classiﬁcation to be revised to a SN Ib (Filippenko et al.
2007b). Foley et al. (2009) however, consider SN 2007J to be a member
of the SNe Iax class.

Fig. 9: Evolution of absorption minima for SN 2015H for a se-
lection of lines that show minimal blending. For comparison, we
show velocities measured for Fe ii λ6149 for both SN 2002cx
and SN 2005hk. Given in black is a typical error bar for mea-
sured velocities. Points marked with grey crosses indicate veloc-
ities of Fe ii λ6247 measured for the N3def model (see § 5), at
the three epochs shown in Fig. 12. Measurements of velocity will
be aﬀected, to some degree, by Monte Carlo noise present in the
model. We, therefore, estimate a median velocity of these three
epochs ±2 d, with the uncertainty given by the standard deviation
of these measurements.

Fe ii and Si ii. Features near 4550 and 5970 Å can be attributed
solely to IGEs for the spectrum under consideration.

Unburned oxygen in the ejecta has been predicted by models
of deﬂagrations of WDs (Gamezo et al. 2004; Jordan et al. 2012;
Fink et al. 2014). Features reported as O i λ7773 have been iden-
tiﬁed in some SNe Iax (Jha et al. 2006; Sahu et al. 2008; Foley
et al. 2009; Narayan et al. 2011). It has also been claimed how-
ever, that similar features in the early spectra of SN 2005hk and
late time spectra of SN 2002cx and SN 2008A can be explained
by Fe ii (Phillips et al. 2007; McCully et al. 2014b). Our spec-
tra show a broad absorption feature around ∼7600 Å, which our
model indicates can be explained by a strong blend of Fe ii and
O i. Similar to the case of Si ii λ6355 above, we do not identify
this feature as being solely due to O i, but instead favour an in-
terpretation where Fe ii is the main contributor. We reiterate that
features such as Si ii and O i may well be easier to identify at
earlier epochs.

Having identiﬁed the dominant ions shaping our optical
spectrum, we now wish to identify the dominant species respon-
sible for the near-IR ﬂux. While the TARDIS model discussed
above is unsuitable for this purpose, the more sophisticated sim-
ulations discussed further in §5 can be used for this purpose.
Based on comparing our spectra to these models, we ﬁnd that as
for the optical spectrum, our 1 − 1.6 µm spectrum taken at +16 d
is dominated by IGEs, in particular Fe ii features and weak Co ii
(Fig. 7).

As with SNe Ia, the detection of H or He in spectra of SNe
Iax could be key to shedding light on the progenitor channel(s).
Indeed, the recent intriguing detection of the progenitor of the
SN Iax 2012Z, has characteristics reminiscent of that of some
He novae (McCully et al. 2014a). Possible detections of He i
(λ5876, λ6678, λ7065) have in fact been reported for two SNe

corrected for galactic extinction. In panel (e) we show the ﬁlter function for the LSQ wide ﬁlter, along with standard ﬁlters SDSS g
and r, and V. Note the we scale each ﬁlter such that peak transmission has a value of 1. Spectra of SN 2002cx and SN 2005hk were
obtained from WISeREP12 (Yaron & Gal-Yam 2012) and originally from the following sources: SNe 2002cx: Li et al. (2003); Jha
et al. (2006). 2005hk: Blondin et al. (2012); Phillips et al. (2007); Silverman et al. (2012).

the identiﬁcation of features that were blended in SN 2002cx and
SN 2005hk. Notably, the broad feature around 6300 Å (which we
believe to be dominated by Fe ii, see § 3.3) in our +6 and +16
day spectra shows clear signs of a double (and possibly triple)
peak, while both SNe 2002cx and 2005hk show smoother fea-
tures at these epochs. The spectra also contain permitted lines
e.g., Ca ii IR triplet, which could easily be identiﬁed throughout
the SN evolution. It appears as a single, broad absorption feature
in this region for SN 2002cx and SN 2005hk, while in SN 2015H
clear multiple absorption features belonging to this transition are
evident. The lower expansion velocities measured in SN 2015H,
together with the fact that it was fainter than both comparison
SNe indicates that it was likely a less energetic explosion.

The similarity between the spectra of all three objects, shown
in Fig. 10(a), (b), and (c), indicates that, despite the diﬀerent
explosion strengths and luminosities, they evolve at a roughly
similar rate. Additionally, the similarities between our +115 d
spectrum, and the much later spectra of SNe 2002cx and 2005hk
(+226 and +371 d post maximum, respectively) are shown in

Fig. 10(d)13. The similarities between these spectra at such dif-
ferent epochs for objects of a similar decline rate indicates that
the spectral features of SNe Iax do not undergo much evolution
throughout this period. These late phase spectra show a complex
blend of forbidden lines at ∼7300 Å speciﬁcally due to [Fe ii],
[Ca ii], and [Ni ii] (Jha et al. 2006).

5. Comparison to Deﬂagration Models
Having shown the similarities of SN 2015H to other SNe Iax,
we now further investigate whether deﬂagration models pro-
posed for this class of object are also consistent with observa-
tions of SN 2015H. In particular, we compare our observations
to the models published by Fink et al. (2014) and Kromer et al.
(2013), which have been shown to provide a reasonable match

13 We have chosen to compare spectra at these epochs, as no spectra of
SNe 2002cx and SN 2005hk are available at comparable epochs. The
spectrum presented here for SN 2002cx is the earliest spectrum avail-

in the redder bands. Consequently, we focus our comparisons on
the angle-averaged observables only.

In Fig. 11, we compare the light curves of SN 2015H to syn-
thetically generated ones from the N1def, N3def, and N5def ex-
plosion models. These are the faintest models produced by the
sequence and therefore provide the best chance of matching the
lower luminosities exhibited by SNe Iax. We ﬁnd that of the 3
models considered here, the best agreement is with the N3def
model. In particular, there is excellent agreement between the
model and observations in the g– and V–band ﬁlters, matching
both the observed peak brightness and decline rate. The agree-
ment with the peak brightness observed in the r–band is also rea-
sonable. The ability of the N3def model to reproduce the bright-
ness observed in SN 2015H indicates that the amount of 56Ni
during the explosion is similar to that inferred from the obser-
vations. In §3.2, we discussed estimates for the amount of 56Ni
and ejecta mass produced by SN 2015H; by ﬁtting the pseudo-
bolometric light curve, we found values of 0.06 and 0.54 M(cid:12),
respectively. The N3def model is consistent with our estimate
of the 56Ni mass in that it yielded ∼0.07 M(cid:12) of 56Ni. The cor-
responding ejecta mass is 0.2 M(cid:12). We discuss reasons for this
mismatch below.

We compare the spectra of SN 2015H to synthetic spectra
generated from the N1def, N3def, and N5def explosion mod-
els in Fig. 12. As with the light curves (Fig. 11), N3def again
provides the best overall match to the brightness of SN 2015H.
Indeed, this model is able to match many of the broader features
observed in the spectra of SN 2015H e.g. the features around
∼5200 Å and ∼6300 Å as well as many of the narrower features
e.g. Fe ii ∼λ6050 Å. ∼λ6150 Å, and ∼λ5500 Å.

Despite the relatively good agreement around maximum
light, there are, however, notable discrepancies between the
models and the data that become increasingly apparent at later
epochs. This is particularly evident in the light curves around
three weeks post-explosion, when the synthetic ﬂux in the red-
der ﬁlters (i.e., redward of ∼6700 Å), drops oﬀ too rapidly, as
shown in Fig. 11; in other words, the N3def model shows a de-
cline rate that is too fast ((∆m15)r ∼1.1) compared to the ob-
servations ((∆m15)r = 0.69±0.04). This mismatch feeds into the
ejecta mass estimate resulting from the N3def model resulting
in a mismatch of close to a factor of three. This is not surpris-
ing as a model with higher ejected mass would have a longer
diﬀusion timescale and is likely to more eﬀectively trap γ-rays
for longer, resulting in a broader light curve with a shallower de-
cline rate. A full exploration of ignition conditions has not been
carried out. Indeed, somewhat tweaked initial conditions such as
the WD central density, could potentially yield a better match to
the decline rate while yielding roughly the same amount of 56Ni;
this warrants further investigation.

6. Summary
We presented optical and infrared photometric and spectroscopic
observations of a peculiar Type Ia SN, 2015H. Through our ex-
tensive photometric coverage of SN 2015H, we found that it
peaked with an absolute magnitude of Mr = −17.27±0.07. Pre-
explosion imaging allowed us to constrain the epoch of explo-
sion, and consequently, the rise time to maximum to approxi-
mately two weeks. The decline rate of SN 2015H is similar to
that observed in some normal SNe Ia, in spite of being approxi-
mately two magnitudes fainter.

SN 2015H shows many of the spectroscopic features typi-
cal of the SN Iax class and similarities to two of the best stud-

to SN 2005hk. These models describe the pure deﬂagration of
Chandrasekhar mass CO WDs with hydrodynamics followed
from the onset of thermonuclear runaway, which is initiated by
inserting multiple spherical ignition spots positioned oﬀ-centre
within the WD. The subsequent propagating ﬂame is treated as
a sharp boundary separating the burned and unburned regions
using a levelset approach (Osher & Sethian 1988). The hydrody-
namic simulation of the explosion is followed until t = 100 s by
which point the ejecta are close to following homologous expan-
sion. Ejecta density and abundances are then used in the radiative
transfer calculation with the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code ARTIS (Sim 2007; Kromer & Sim 2009). Full details of the
hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, and radiative transfer calcula-
tions are given by Fink et al. (2014).

Fink et al. (2014) found that the energy released during the
explosion and the luminosity scale as a function of the number of
ignition spots used in the model; more ignition spots lead to the
release of more energy. The number of ignition spots in a simu-
lation can therefore be used as a numerical parameter to control
the strength of the explosion in the model sequence (but we note
that the number of ignition points used should not necessarily
be taken literally as a requirement on the ignition conﬁguration).
Given that SN 2015H was at least half a magnitude fainter than
SN 2005hk, we limit our model comparison to those models with
only a few ignition spots, as was done for SN 2005hk by Kromer
et al. (2013).

Each model is named corresponding to the number of igni-
tion spots (e.g. N10def uses 10 spots) used to initiate the explo-
sion. Fink et al. (2014) used a total of 14 models, from a single
ignition spot up to 1600 spots. Models with few ignition spots
(≤100) do not release suﬃcient energy during the explosion to
completely unbind the WD. This results in those models leaving
behind a (potentially massive) bound remnant, up to ∼1.3 M(cid:12). In
addition, those models show more complex ejecta structures due
to the asymmetric ﬂame propagation. These eﬀects, however, are
relatively minor: for those objects with only a few ignition spots,
there is only a modest ((cid:46)0.2 magnitude) scatter in the synthetic
V–band light curves across the entire range of observer orienta-
tions (Fink et al. 2014). Furthermore, this scatter is even smaller

ied members: SNe 2002cx and 2005hk. Speciﬁcally, spectra at
all epochs show low-velocity features (velocities approximately
half what is observed in normal SNe Ia) and our radiative trans-
fer modelling suggests that many of the features present in the
spectra of SN 2015H can be explained by, or at least involve a
signiﬁcant degree of blending with, IGEs.

We compared our observations with the deﬂagration models
of MCh CO WDs published by Fink et al. (2014) and found good
agreement, the best match being with one of their fainter models
(N3def). For epochs up to approximately 50 d post-explosion,
this model accounts for the luminosity observed in the g– and
V–bands for SN 2015H. We ﬁnd good agreement between the
amount of 56Ni produced by this best-matching model (0.07
M(cid:12)) and our estimate, based on ﬁtting the pseudo-bolometric
light curve of SN 2015H, (∼0.06 M(cid:12)). This model is also able
to reproduce many of the spectroscopic features observed in
SN 2015H.

The agreement between the model and observations, how-
ever, begins to deteriorate at approximately three weeks post-
explosion, particularly at wavelengths longer than ∼6700 Å.
While we ﬁnd that N3def provides good agreement with the peak
luminosity in the r–band, the light curve evolution of the model
it too rapid; the rise time of N3def is shorter than SN 2015H

Article number, page 12 of 19

while the decline rate is faster (see Figs. 5 and 6). Kromer et al.
(2013) found similar results when comparing the N5def model
to SN 2005hk. The most likely cause of faster evolution is that
the ejecta mass in the models is too low. Indeed, N3def produces
only 0.20 M(cid:12) of ejecta, while our ﬁt to the pseudo-bolometric
lightcurve of SN 2015H suggests a value close to ∼0.54 M(cid:12). In-
creasing the ejecta mass would increase the diﬀusion time and
slow the evolution, as required by the data. Within the current
(Fink et al. 2014) sequence of models, adopting a model with
higher ejecta mass would also result in increased 56Ni mass.
However, the Fink et al. (2014) simulations were not intended
as a systematic exploration of the full parameter space for deﬂa-
gration models, and there is scope for considerable further study.
We note, in particular, that Jordan et al. (2012) presented models
adopting a lower WD central density and diﬀerent ignition con-
ditions from the Fink et al. (2014) simulations, and obtained a
lower fraction yield of IGE to total ejecta mass, suggesting that
it might be possible to develop models with higher ejecta mass,
without a corresponding increase in the mass of 56Ni. We note
that such a model would also be likely to have lower speciﬁc
kinetic energy and thus lower line velocities, which may further
improve the agreement with key spectral features (see e.g. the
Ca ii near-IR triplet in Fig. 12.

A full study testing the parameter space of MCh WDs is
needed to explore this further. Similar model exploration should
also be considered for alternative scenarios, such as the pulsa-
tional delayed detonation scenario: as discussed by Stritzinger
et al. (2015), this may be a good match for events as bright as
SN 2012Z, but it remains to be seen whether events as faint as
SN 2008ha and SN 2010ae, or indeed even SN 2015H, can be
comfortably ﬁt within such a framework.

An interesting prediction from the deﬂagration model we
have considered is that the SN explosion will leave behind a
massive (∼1.2 M(cid:12) for N3def) bound14 remnant. Our own esti-
mate for the ejecta mass of SN 2015H (∼0.54 M(cid:12)) suggests a
smaller, but still substantial, remnant mass of ∼0.85 M(cid:12) (assum-
ing a MCh progenitor). It may be possible that such a remnant
already contributes a non-negligible fraction to the observed ﬂux
(Kromer et al. 2013). Indeed, this contribution may be more sig-
niﬁcant for N3def than brighter models, such as N5def, as the
fraction of 56Ni contained within the bound remnant compared
to the ejecta is much higher (by ∼40% compared to N5def). In-
terestingly, the detection of a point-source at the location of one
of the faintest SNe Iax, 2008ha has been reported over four years
after the SN discovery (Foley et al. 2014), by which time, the SN
should have faded away. It is conceivable that an explosion rem-
nant may contribute to this emission, but further investigation is
needed.

Models involving the deﬂagration of CO WDs have previ-
ously been shown to be broadly consistent with those SNe Iax
that are bright (e.g. SN2005hk, Kromer et al. 2013). In this
study, we have shown that models of weaker deﬂagrations in
MCh CO WDs producing ∼0.07 M(cid:12) of 56Ni are able to repro-
duce the features observed in fainter events such as SN2015H.
Combined with the hybrid CONe WD deﬂagration model pro-
posed for the very faintest members of the class (e.g. SN2008ha
Kromer et al. 2015), this suggests that deﬂagrations of WDs are
able to account for SNe Iax across the entire brightness range
of SNe Iax. Whether such deﬂagrations are the sole or domi-
nant channel giving rise to SNe Iax requires further investiga-
tion, but we conclude that the models discussed here do show
promise, and merit continued investigation and reﬁnement. We
also stress the need for further observations of this class of su-
pernova, including objects that are discovered post-peak, such as
SN 2015H.

Appendix B: Example TARDIS model for SN 2015H
Here we describe the TARDIS model used to generate a syn-
thetic spectrum of SN 2015H, as shown in Fig. 8. We stress that
the model presented here provides a good match to the observed
spectrum, but is not a unique solution given the inevitable de-
generacy between the input parameters.

TARDIS is a 1D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code that
assumes the SN ejecta are spherically symmetric. The model
domain is divided into a number of equally spaced concentric
zones, deﬁned by an inner and an outer boundary. A TARDIS
calculation consists of an iterative sequence of Monte Carlo ra-
diative transfer simulations. Each Monte Carlo packet, repre-
senting a bundle of identical photons, has frequency randomly
selected from a blackbody distribution and is injected into the
model at the inner boundary and propagated through the model
region. Once all packet propagation is complete, the packet ﬂight
histories are used to estimate local ionization/excitation con-
ditions in each zone, and to compute an emergent spectrum.
The escaping packets are also used to make an improved es-
timate of the input blackbody temperature required to match a
user-speciﬁed value for the total emergent luminosity. The new
ionization/excitation conditions and blackbody temperature are
adopted in the next iteration, duly leading to a consistent model.
The ﬁnal emergent spectrum can then be analysed and compared
to the observations.

In the model adopted here, we use a uniform composition

and exponential density proﬁle for the SN ejecta

where v is the velocity, texp is the time since explosion, and v0 and
t0 are a reference velocity and time, respectively. The boundaries
of the model are set in velocity space at values guided by the
velocities measured in SN 2015H as shown in Fig. 9. Values
for the emergent luminosity and texp are chosen based on our
photometric measurements (see Section 3.2 for discussion on the
explosion date of SN 2015H).

In Table B.2 we compare the composition of the ejecta in
our TARDIS model to the deﬂagration models N3def (Fink et al.
2014) and 2D70 (Jordan et al. 2012). We developed the model
ejecta composition by initially including only Ca and ﬁtting
the Ca ii IR triplet proﬁle. Having obtained good agreement, we
progressively added the elements expected in SNe Iax spectra
guided by explosive nucleosynthesis models (Fink et al. 2014).
Some elements (such as Ne, Al, etc.) were found to have a neg-
ligible eﬀect on our model spectrum we therefore do not in-

Notes. N3def values are taken from the N3def model published by Fink
et al. (2014). 2D70 values are taken from Jordan et al. (2012). Val-
ues given here represent mass fractions of each model. Values given
in parentheses are mass fractions of the N3def model in the region with
velocities between 5500 km s−1 and 7500 km s−1, the range of velocities
covered in our TARDIS calculations. Here, we deﬁne IMEs as elements
with atomic number between Z = 11 and Z = 20 (sodium to calcium),
while IGEs refers to elements with Z = 21 to 28 (scandium to nickel).
Elements not included in the TARDIS model were found to have neg-
ligible impact on the spectrum, and are therefore unconstrained by our
modelling.

clude them in the TARDIS model, despite them having signif-
icant abundances in explosive nucleosynthesis models. In such
cases the abundances should be regarded as unconstrained by
our TARDIS model.

We ﬁnd that our preferred ejecta composition is broadly con-
sistent with that of the N3def model published by Fink et al.
(2014). However, there are some notable diﬀerences: in particu-
lar, compared to the N3def (Fink et al. 2014) and 2D70 (Jordan
et al. 2012) models, our empirically derived composition favours
a lower mass fraction of IMEs. This may be due to the relatively
late epochs of our observed spectra, where any strong signatures
of IMEs are masked by IGEs. Earlier spectra may have provided
more robust constraints on the abundance of IMEs, and/or any
potential stratiﬁcation in the ejecta.
