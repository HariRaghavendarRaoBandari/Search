Abstract

We discuss the observability of neutrino-induced sphaleron transitions in the IceCube detector,

encouraged by a recent paper by Tye and Wong (TW), which argued on the basis of a Bloch wave

function in the periodic sphaleron potential that such transitions should be enhanced compared

to most previous calculations. We calculate the dependence on neutrino energy of the sphaleron

transition rate, comparing it to that for conventional neutrino interactions, and we discuss the

observability of tau and multi-muon production in sphaleron-induced transitions. We use IceCube

4-year data to constrain the sphaleron rate, ﬁnding that it is comparable to the upper limit inferred
previously from a recast of an ATLAS search for microscopic black holes at the LHC with ∼ 3/fb of
collisions at 13 TeV. The IceCube constraint is stronger for a sphaleron barrier height ESph (cid:38) 9 TeV,
and would be comparable with the prospective LHC sensitivity with 300/fb of data at 14 TeV if
ESph ∼ 11 TeV.

Introduction

The recent discovery of the Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV by ATLAS and CMS [1, 2]
completes the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. Ongoing measurements of interac-
tions of Higgs and gauge bosons ﬁnd good agreement with perturbative predictions of the
Standard Model with its spontaneously broken SU (2) × U (1) gauge group [3–8]. A direct
consequence of the SU (2) gauge group, beyond the perturbative regime, is the existence of
non-perturbative topological eﬀects. Field conﬁgurations with ﬁnite Euclidean action are
classiﬁed by an integer topological winding number, namely the Chern-Simons number NCS.
Topologically distinct ground states are separated by an energy barrier, and the sphaleron
[9] is an extremal saddle point on top of the barrier with half-integer NCS and an energy
ESph (cid:39) 9 TeV. Owing to the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, transitions through sphaleron
conﬁgurations would lead to striking (B+L)-violating processes. Direct observation of such
interactions can be of capital importance in explaining the mechanism underlying the cosmo-
logical baryon asymmetry [10–14], which might arise from the transmutation of a primordial
lepton asymmetry.

While the energy of the sphaleron is directly linked to the shape of the eﬀective potential
for the Chern-Simons number and is thus rather undisputed, its production rate is subject
to large theoretical uncertainties [15–17]. Over the years, there have been many estimates
of the rate of sphaleron transitions in high-energy collisions, most of them with discouraging
results for the prospects for experimental searches. However, a new approach [9], exploiting
the periodicity of the Chern-Simons potential, has challenged this paradigm and argued in
favour of enhanced sphaleron-induced transition rates.

The authors indicate that, since the eﬀective Chern-Simons potential is periodic, it is
appropriate to use a Bloch wave function to estimate the sphaleron-induced transition rate.
They ﬁnd that, although the transition rate is still strongly suppressed at energies below the
sphaleron threshold energy, the rate may not be suppressed at higher energies above ESph.
Motivated by this suggestion, two of us (JE and KS) have analyzed the observability
of sphaleron-induced transitions at the LHC and possible future higher-energy pp colliders,
and recast a recent ATLAS search for microscopic black holes using ∼ 3/fb of data at
In this way, expanding on
13 TeV in the centre-of-mass as a search for sphalerons [18].
previous proposals [19, 20], we were able to establish for the ﬁrst time a signiﬁcant direct
experimental constraint on sphaleron-induced transitions, assess the potential improvement
in sensitivity of future LHC runs with higher integrated luminosities and possibly energy,
and preview the corresponding prospects for possible future higher-energy pp colliders.

In this connection, it is important to remember that cosmic rays provide collisions with
centre-of-mass energies beyond those attainable with the LHC. However, the low fraction of
ultra-high-energy pp collisions that would produce sphaleron transitions, combination with
the limitations of the Auger experiment [21] for extracting detailed information from air
showers renders challenging this avenue in searches for sphalerons [22].

Better prospects may be oﬀered by ultra-high-energy neutrino events [23–27], which
could be observed in a cubic-kilometer neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube [28, 29] and
KM3NeT [30]. As we discuss in more detail below, the estimates of TW suggest that the
rate of sphaleron-induced transitions in the highest-energy cosmic-ray collisions observed by
IceCube could be comparable to the conventional neutrino cross section, and might even
dominate the interactions of cosmogenic neutrinos [31] produced by the Greisen-Zatsepin-
Kuzmin (GZK) process [32, 33]: p + γCMB → π+ → ν.

Accordingly, in this paper we extend the analysis of ES to ultra-high-energy neutrino
interactions, estimating the upper limit on sphaleron transitions obtainable from present
IceCube results and considering the implications for GZK neutrinos. Remarkably, we ﬁnd
that the present IceCube sensitivity is very similar to that of the ﬁrst LHC data at 13 TeV.
If the rate of sphaleron transitions were to saturate the present LHC limit, the rate of
GZK neutrino interactions would be signiﬁcantly higher than is conventionally estimated,
improving signiﬁcantly the prospects for their future detection with IceCube or a cubic-
kilometre detector.

2 Neutrino-Nucleon Cross-Section Calculations

The analysis of [9] is based on the idea that sphaleron transitions changing the Chern-
Simons number n can be modelled by considering a Bloch wave function for an eﬀective
one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation

The sphaleron barrier height ESph is the maximum value of the eﬀective potential V (Q),
which is ESph = 9.11 TeV in a pure SU (2) theory, and is estimated to be reduced by ∼ 1%

when the U (1) of the Standard Model is included. Following [9], we assume ESph = 9 TeV
as a nominal value, but present some numerical results for ESph ∈ [8, 11] TeV.

transitions in neutrino collisions for a barrier height ESph = 9 TeV, c = 2 and p = 1 in Eq. (2.5)
with S given by (2.4) (red solid curve) and, for comparison, choices ESph = 8 and 10 TeV (red
dot-dashed and dashed lines, respectively). The variations in the sphaleron curves for 1 ≤ c ≤ 4 are
within the widths of the lines, but we recall that the overall normalization factor p is quite uncertain.

ESph = 9(8)(10) TeV, and the black dashed line is the sum of the conventional charged-
and neutral-current neutrino cross sections. We see that the sphaleron-induced cross section
would dominate for Eν (cid:38) 2 × 108 TeV if p = 1, but recall that this factor is quite uncertain.
The cross section estimates in Fig. 1 can be convoluted with the cosmogenic neutrino ﬂux,
d2Φ/(dEνdtdΩ) [GeV−1 cm−2 s−1 sr−1], to calculate the event rates. We use the cosmogenic
neutrino ﬂux estimated in [36] throughout this paper. The event rate in the IceCube detector
also depends on the energy-dependent eﬀective neutrino detection area, Aeﬀ(Eν), which
has been evaluated by the IceCube collaboration [37] using conventional neutrino-nucleon
interaction. Assuming the same detection eﬃciency, we estimate the sphaleron-induced
IceCube event rate as

strongly by a possible energy dependence in the overall factor p, but depend essentially only
on the value of p at the sphaleron threshold energy.

3 Leptons in Sphaleron-Induced Transitions

In the IceCube detector [29], neutral current interaction and charged current interaction of
electron neutrinos leave a shower-like signature, whilst high energy muons and very high
energy taus (Eτ > 107 GeV) leave a track-like signature. IceCube expects to be able to see
a ‘double-bang’ signature for τ leptons with energies ∈ [106, 107] GeV.

We simulate distributions of leptons (µ and τ ) produced by the sphaleron-induced
neutrino-quark collision events in parton level. We consider the simplest possibility of such
events: qν → 8¯q2¯(cid:96) induced by the gauge invariant (¯q ¯q ¯q)1(¯q ¯q ¯q)2(¯q ¯q ¯q)3(¯(cid:96)1
¯(cid:96)3) operator, where
the suﬃx denotes the generation. We assume equal ﬂux for each ﬂavour of cosmogenic neu-
trinos. Leptons can be produced either directly from the primary interaction, qν → 8¯q2¯(cid:96), or
secondarily from the decay of the heavy particles (t and W ).

¯(cid:96)2

The left panel of Fig. 4 displays the primary and secondary µ and τ energy distributions
(which are identical) normalised to a single sphaleron-induced event. We see that the primary
lepton energies are peaked just below 108 GeV, whereas the secondary lepton energies are
peaked closer to 107 GeV. IceCube expects to be able to see a ‘double-bang’ signature for
τ leptons with energies ∈ [106, 107] GeV. We see that sphaleron-induced transitions would
produce some primary and secondary τ leptons in this energy range. However, we ﬁnd only

opening angles in the laboratory frame between pairs of leptons in sphaleron transitions in neutrino

5% of the sphaleron-induced events have τ leptons in this energy range.

Since the sphaleron-induced interaction can produce multiple leptons, IceCube might
be able to see multiple tracks in the event if those tracks are separated more than 17 m.
This separation typically requires the opening angle of the leptons to be (cid:38) 2 · 10−2. The
right panel of Fig. 4 displays histograms of the (cid:96)− (cid:96) opening angles in the laboratory frame,
colour-coded for the diﬀerent combinations of primary and secondary leptons, and again
normalised to a single sphaleron-induced event. We see that the opening angles are in all
cases much smaller than the IceCube angular resolution, so we do not expect multiple lepton
tracks to be distinguished.

IceCube Constraints on Sphaleron-Induced Transitions

In the absence of a distinctive leptonic signature, we use the generic IceCube search for
which detection eﬃciency is encoded in the eﬀective neutrino detection area given in [37].
Moreover, we assume in the absence of a detailed simulation of the IceCube eﬃciency for
detecting sphaleron-induced ﬁnal states that it is the same as that for conventional ﬁnal
states, and that the neutrino spectrum keeps falling at energies above 1011 GeV. Fig. 5
compares the upper limit on the overall cross-section factor p obtained in this way from

ATLAS Run 2 search for microscopic black holes with ∼ 3/fb of data at 13 TeV [39] (solid
blue lines). The upper panel of Fig. 5 is for ∆n = −1 transitions, which yield ﬁnal states
with 10 energetic particles at the LHC, and the lower panel is for ∆n = +1 transitions,
which yield 14-particle ﬁnal states at the LHC.

The LHC constraints in Fig. 5 are diﬀerent for the 10- and 14-particle ﬁnal states, and
quite sensitive to the assumed value of the sphaleron energy ESph.
(We recall that our
nominal value is ESph = 9 TeV, but we display results for ESph ∈ [8, 11] TeV.) This is
because the rate for sphaleron-induced transitions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy
of 13 TeV is quite sensitive to ESph. In contrast, the IceCube 4-year limit is quite insensitive
to ESph over the range studied, because of the larger range of neutrino energies. Within our
assumptions, the IceCube eﬃciencies and hence limits for ∆n = ±1 transitions are the same,
whereas the LHC limits are stronger for ∆n = +1 transitions, for which we estimated in [18]
a greater detection eﬃciency.

By a remarkable coincidence, we see that the LHC and IceCube constraints are almost
identical for the nominal value ESph = 9 TeV, but the IceCube limits are stronger for larger
ESph, becoming some 3 orders of magnitude stronger for ESph = 11 TeV.

We also display in Fig. 5 the prospective future LHC exclusion sensitivities for higher
integrated luminosities (dashed and dot-dashed blue lines) and energy (dashed and dot-
dashed green lines). We see that 300/fb of luminosity at 14 TeV would be needed for the
LHC sensitivity to surpass the IceCube constraint for ESph = 11 TeV. We anticipate that
the IceCube sensitvity will also be improved by longer operating time and/or eﬀective size,
and note that an order-of-magnitude improvement in the IceCube sensitivity would make it
highly competitive with the LHC with 3000/fb for ESph = 11 TeV, with both being able to
reach p (cid:39) 10−2. On the other hand, for the nominal value ESph = 9 TeV, the LHC would
have a greater reach than IceCube, down to p < 10−4.

5 Summary and Conclusions

We have shown that IceCube could have a sensitivity to spahaleron-induced transitions that
is comparable to that of the LHC. For a cross-section prefactor p = 1, the rate of such
transitions in neutrino collisions would exceed the sum of conventional charged- and neutral-
current interactions for Eν (cid:38) 2×108 GeV, as seen in Fig. 1, yielding a larger number of events
for a neutrino threshold energy above Eν = 107 GeV, as seen in Fig. 2. Our simulations
of neutrino-induced sphaleron transitions do not reveal any distinctive leptonic signatures,

multilepton bundles that are probably not resolvable, as seen in the right panel of Fig. 4.

Remarkably, the prospective IceCube constraints on sphaleron-induced transitions are
comparable to those from the LHC, as seen in Fig. 5, with IceCube having an advantage for
large sphaleron energies ESph and the LHC at small ESph. The crossover is currently close
to the nominal value ESph = 9 TeV.

Our estimates need to be validated by dedicated experimental simulations for IceCube
as well as for the LHC, but our results indicate that both have interesting sensitivities for
sphaleron-induced transitions, able to probe signiﬁcantly below p = 1, and hence able to test
or constrain the suggestion by Tye and Wong [9] that sphaleron transitions may be much
less suppressed than commonly thought previously.
