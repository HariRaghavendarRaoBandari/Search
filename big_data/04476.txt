Introduction

The aim of this text is to present, in a concise manner, a set of open questions relating to
operators on symmetric functions that are relevant to rectangular Catalan combinatorics. In
some form or another, some of these questions have already been considered, but we thought
it good to have them all state together. For sure, several questions are new. On top of giving
proofs for several of their specializations, the identities and properties considered here have
been thoroughly checked for as large as possible a set of special cases. Hence they are stated
with a good degree of conﬁdence.

The eﬀect of these operators appears to be elegantly linked to the combinatorics of
rectangular Dyck paths, and associated parking functions. This is explicitly made evident
when one specializes one of the parameters, say t, to be equal to 1.

1. Elliptic Hall Algebra

In a fashion somewhat similar to how creation operators are used in quantum mechanics,
the main actors of our story are operators on symmetric functions that we eventually apply to
the simplest symmetric function 1, aiming at constructing interesting symmetric functions.

Date: March 20, 2016. This work was supported by NSERC.

These operators belong to a realization of the “positive part” E of the “elliptic Hall algebra”
(see below for more details) as a subalgebra of End(Λ), where

Λ =Xd≥o

Λd,

is the degree-graded algebra of symmetric functions over the ﬁeld Q(q, t). In this context,
they are generated by two families of “well-known” operators. The ﬁrst of these is the set
of operators that correspond to multiplication by symmetric functions.

(−) · f : Λd −→ Λd+k,

(that is g 7→ g · f , for f ∈ Λk);

(1.1)

while the second is a family {Dn}n∈Z of operators considered (see [3]) in the study of Mac-
donald polynomials. Let us recall that these operators Dn, send degree d symmetric function
to degree d + n

They are jointly deﬁned by the generating function equality

Dk : Λd −→ Λd+k.

∞Xk=−∞

Dk(g(x)) zk := g[x + M/z]Xn≥0

en(x) (−z)n,

(1.2)

here written using plethystic notation (see [3] for more on this), for any g(x) ∈ Λd, and
writing M = M(q, t) for (1 − t)(1 − q). It may be shown that D0 is a Macdonald eigen-
operator. This is to say that it aﬀords the (combinatorial) Macdonald polynomials as joint
eigenfunctions. It may also be worth recalling that, for all k, we have

Dk+1 =

1
M

[Dk, p1],

(1.3)

with [−, −] standing for the usual Lie bracket of operators, and e1 correspond to multipli-
cation by the degree 1 elementary symmetric function. In other words, all of the Dk (for
k > 0) are obtained as order k Lie-derivatives, with respect to the operator of multiplication
by p1/M. Maybe even better for calculation purposes, we have

Dk+j =

(1 − tj)(1 − qj)

1

[Dk, pj],

(1.4)

for all k and j. Indeed, considering the above operator generating series D(z) =P∞

one may check that

zj[D(z), pj(x)] = (1 − tj)(1 − qj) D(z),

k=−∞ Dk zk,

simply by calculating that1

zj[D(z), pj] g(x) =

[Dk, pj](g(x)) zk

∞Xk=−∞
= zj(cid:16)g[x + M/z] pj[x + M/z] − g[x + M/z] pj(x)(cid:17)Xn≥0
= zj(cid:16)g[x + M/z] (1 − tj)(1 − qj)/zj(cid:17)Xn≥0

en(x) (−z)n

= (1 − tj)(1 − qj) D(z) g(x).

1Recall that, in plethystic notation, one has pj[x + M/z] = pj(x) + (1 − tj)(1 − qj)/zj.

en(x) (−z)n

In particular, we get (1 − tj)(1 − qj)Dj = [D0, pj], reducing the calculation of Dj to that of
D0, modulo a single bracket operation.

We recall from [15] that the positive part E of the elliptic Hall algebra2 may be realized

as a (N × N)-graded algebra of operators on Λ

E = M(m,n)∈N2

Em,n,

with the operators in the homogeneous component Em,n sending Λd to Λd+n. Special cases
of these operators were introduced in [3, see Thm 4.4], where relevant properties were also
stressed out. As mentioned previously, generators for E include the Dk operators, which are
considered to be of degree (1, k), as well as the operators of multiplication by symmetric
functions lying in Λd, which are considered to be of degree (0, d). It is also established in
[15] that, for each pair of coprime integers (a, b), there are ring monomorphisms

Θa,b : Λ −→ E,

explicitly described below, such that Θa,b(Λd)) ⊆ E(ad,bd). In particular, this says that one
has commutation of operators belonging to the image of Θa,b, for any given coprime pair
(a, b). Following [7], the easiest way to give an explicit description of these monomorphisms,
is to ﬁx the Θa,b-image of the functions

qd = qd(x; q, t) := Xj+k=d−1

(−qt)−j s(j | k)(x),

(1.5)

where s(j | k)(x) stands for the hook indexed Schur symmetric functions, where the hook has
one part of size j + 1, and k parts of 1. Hence, we clearly have

q1(x) = s1(x),

q2(x) = s11(x) −

s2(x),

q3(x) = s111(x) −

s21(x) +

Observe that, when the parameters q and t are such that qt = 1, then qd(x) specialize
to the classical power sum symmetric functions pd(x). Hence the set {qd((x)}d forms an
independent algebraic generator set for Λ. It will be useful to consider the linear basis of Λd
which is made up of the functions

with µ = µ1µ2 · · · µk running over the set of integer partitions of d.

qµ(x) := qµ1(x)qµ2(x) · · · qµk (x),

2The full algebra is Z2-graded, but we only need the positive components for our purpose.

For each degree d symmetric function fd, and any coprime pair (a, b), we consider oper-
ators Θa,b(fd) ∈ Ead,bd. In other words, assuming that we have described3 Θa,b(qd), and that
the expansion of fd in the basis {qµ(x)}µ⊢d is

fd(x) =Xµ⊢d

cµ(q, t) qµ(x),

then we clearly have

Θa,b(fd) :=Xµ⊢d

cµ(q, t) Θa,b(qµ),

with

Θa,b(qµ) = Θa,b(qµ1) · · · Θa,b(qµk),

(1.6)

observe that we do not worry here about the order in which the operators Θa,b(qµi) should
be applied, since they commute. This fact is assured by the general properties of the elliptic
Hall algebra established in [15] and related papers. These properties insure that all the
construction described here make sense. One of the striking implications of the properties of
E, see [4], is that, for all (a, b) coprime, all d ∈ N, and all fd, one has the operator identity

∇ Θa,b(fd) ∇−1 = Θa+b,b(fd).

Hence, using the inverse relation,

∇−1 Θa,b(fd) ∇ = Θa−b,b(fd),

one may extend Θa,b to negative values of a. It may then be checked that

(−qt) ω∗ Θa,b(fd) ω∗ = Θ−a,b(ω∗ fd).

(1.7)

(1.8)

(1.9)

Here ∇ stands for the much-discussed Macdonald eigenoperator, which is such that ∇(en)
gives the bigraded Frobenius characteristic of the diagonal coinvariant space of Sn (see [2]
for more on this). We also denoted by ω∗ is the involutive operator that sends fd(x; q, t) to

(−1/qt)d−1 ωfd(x; 1/q, 1/t).

Because of ties with representation theory, we are interested in functions fd such that the
application of the operators Θa,b(fd) to the constant symmetric function 1 gives Schur-
positive4 symmetric function, for any coprime a, b ≥ 1. When this is so, we say that fd
gives rise to Schur-positive operators, and denote by f (a,b)
(x; q, t) the symmetric function
Θa,b(fd)(1).

d

Deﬁnition of the basic operators. For coprime a, b ≥ 1, we now describe how to recur-
sively construct5 basic operators Θa,b(qd) as degree (ad, bd) (non commutative) polynomials
in the D0 and multiplication by e1, respectively considered to be of degree (1, 0) and (0, 1).
We start by writing Q0k for the operator of multiplication by the symmetric function qk(x),
and Qk0 for the operator (−1)k Dk. For m, n ≥ 1, we then recursively deﬁne operators Qmn
by the Lie bracket formula

Qmn :=

1
M

[Quv, Qkl],

(1.10)

3See formula (1.11).
4Recall that this means that its Schur function expansion has coeﬃcients in N[q, t]. See Appendix ??.
5This essentially comes from [7], which in turn is a translation of the results presented in [15] and related

papers.

where we choose (k, l) such that (m, n) = (k, l) + (u, v), with (k, l) and (u, v) lying in N2,
l − (kn/m) is minimal, and such that

det(cid:18)u v

k l(cid:19) = d,

with d standing for the greatest common divisor of m and n. Moreover, if (m, n) = (ad, bd),
we ask that (k, l) be chosen to be the same as it would for (a, b). For example, we get the
Lie bracket expressions

or

Q43 =

1
M 6 [[e1, D0], [[e1, D0], [[e1, D0], D0]]],

Q63 =

1
M 8 [[e1, D0], [[[e1, D0], D0], [[[e1, D0], D0], D0]]].

For sure, the monomials that occur in the expansion of Qmn involve m copies of D0, and n
copies of e1. We these operators at hand, we my now deﬁne the monomorphisms Θa,b by
setting

In particular, our above notation convention makes it so that we may write q(a,b)
Qad,bd(1).

2. Schur Positive Operators

More generally, we are interested in symmetric functions fd, here called seeds, such that
we get Schur-positive operators Θa,b(fd). Recall that this means that the symmetric function
f (a,b)
(x; q, t) (which is just another way of writing Θa,b(fd)(1)) expands with coeﬃcients in
d
N[q, t] in the Schur function basis. In other terms, we want

Chief among the interesting operators of this kind are those for which the seed fd(x) is
chosen to be

0 (cid:22)s f (a,b)

d

(x; q, t).

(2.1)

(1) the elementary symmetric functions ed(x);
(2) the suitably normalized complete homogeneous symmetric functions (−qt)1−khd(x);
(3) or more generally, the renormalized Schur functions (−qt)−ι(µ)sµ(x) where, for an

integer partition µ of d, we set

ι(µ) :=

χ(µ(i) − i);

ℓ(µ)Xi=1

(4) for any partition µ, the monomial symmetric functions (−1)n−ℓ(µ) mµ(x).

Observe that all the above operators coincide for d = 1, since there is essentially but one seed
of degree 1, up to a constant factor. In other words, the operators only become diﬀerent
when one considers d > 1. It immediately follows from the deﬁnitions that the resulting
operators are linked by the same relations as those between their seeds.

The compositional (ad, bd)-shuﬄe conjecture. Recall from [4] the conjectured combi-
natorial formula for the eﬀect on 1 of the operators having as seed the symmetric function
Cα := Cα(1), where one sets Cα := Ca1 Ca2 · · · Caℓ, for any composition α = a1a2 . . . aℓ of d,
with the individual operators Ca speciﬁed by the formula

Caf [x] := (−t)1−af [x − (t − 1)/(tz)] Xm≥0

,

zmhm[x](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)za

where (−)(cid:12)(cid:12)za means that we take the coeﬃcient of za in the series considered. In our current

notations the compositional (ad, bd)-shuﬄe conjecture (of [4]) states that

tdinv(π)scomp(π)(x),

(2.2)

C (a,b)

α

(x; q, t) =Xγ

qarea(γ)Xπ

where the ﬁrst sum is over all (ad, bd)-Dyck paths that return to the diagonal at positions
speciﬁed by the composition α, and the second is over parking functions whose underlying
path is γ (Necessary concepts and notations are deﬁned in the appendix).
It is known
(see [8]) that for any given (ad, bd)-Dyck path γ, the summation

tdinv(π)scomp(π)(x),

Xπ

is a LLT-polynomial, which is Schur positive, hence it follows from (2.2) that C (a,b)
is Schur positive, that is

α

(x; q, t)

(2.3)
It is also known that this LLT polynomial specializes to eρ(γ)(x) at t = 1, so that proving
(2.2) would also show that, for all α and all coprime (a, b),

(x; q, t).

In a similar vein, our ﬁrst open question is:

(2.5)

for all partition µ of d, and all coprime a, b ≥ 1? Can we explain this in terms of bigraded
subrepresentations6 of the Sn-module of generalized diagonal harmonics?

For example, we have

(−qt)−1s(1,2)

(x; q, t) = (q + t) s222 + s321 +(cid:0)q2 + qt + t2 + q + t(cid:1) s2211

+(cid:0)q4 + q3t + q2t2 + qt3 + t4 + q2t + qt2(cid:1) s111111,
(x; q, t) = (cid:0)q2 + qt + t2(cid:1) s222 + (q + t)(cid:0)q2 + t2 + q + t(cid:1) s2211
+ (q + t) s3,21 +(cid:0)q2 + qt + t2(cid:1) s3111
+(cid:0)q4 + q3t + q2t2 + qt3 + t4 + q3 + 2 q2t + 2 qt2 + t3(cid:1) s21111
+(cid:0)q2 + qt + t2(cid:1)(cid:0)q3 + t3 + qt(cid:1) s111111.

Answering Question-1 in the positive would settle many previous conjectures. The special
case µ = 1d (which coincides for both this open question and the one below) corresponds
to the known Schur positivity of ∇(en); and for general b = 1, it is implied by the Shuf-
ﬂe Conjecture [10, Conjecture 3.1]. For µ = (d), it corresponds to a special case of [11,
Conjecture 3.3]. For general µ, and b = 1, it corresponds to [3, Conjecture I]. Indeed, this
last assertion follows from (1.7). To see it, we apply the operators of identity (1.7) to the
constant symmetric function 1, to get

f (a+b,b)
d

(x; q, t) = Θa+b,b(fd)(1)

= ∇ Θa,b(fd)∇−1(1)
= ∇ Θa,b(fd)(1)
= ∇f (a,b)

(x; q, t),

d

(2.6)

for all (a, b) and any seed fd. Then, using the fact that Θ01 = IdΛ, one needs only choose
(a, b) = (0, 1) and fd = (−qt)−ι(µ)sµ to get back the relevant conjecture. It follows that

and in particular, that

f (r,1)
d

(x; q, t) = ∇r(fd).

e(r,1)
d

(x; q, t) = ∇r(ed).

Clearly, if a seed fd expands positively in the basis

(−qt)−ι(µ)sµ(x; q, t),

(2.7)

(2.8)

then the associated f (a,b)
tively. Obvious cases include ed(x), (−qt)1−dhd(x), qd(x) (in view of (1.5)), and

(x; q, t) will perforce be s-positive if Question-1 is answered posi-

d

(−1)k−1pk(x) = Xj+k=d−1

(qt)j(cid:16)(−qt)−j s(j | k)(x)(cid:17).

Another general family of cases goes as follows,

Question. 2. Can we prove that

for all partition µ of d, and all coprime a, b ≥ 1?

0 (cid:22)s (−1)d−ℓ(µ) m(a,b)

µ

(x; q, t),

(2.9)

Preferably, this would be explained by introducing adequate bigraded Sn-modules whose
bigraded Forbenius characteristic would correspond to these Schur positive expressions. For
example, we have

−m(1,1)

21

(x; q, t) = 2 s3 +(cid:0)q2t + qt2 + 2 q2 + 2 qt + 2 t2 + 2 q + 2 t(cid:1) s21

+(cid:0)q3t + q2t2 + qt3 + 2 q3 + 2 q2t + 2 qt2 + 2 t3 + 2 qt(cid:1) s111.

Once again Question-2 relates to previous conjectures. For instance, the case b = 1 corre-
sponds to Conjecture IV of [3], which asserts the Schur-positivity of ∇a((−1)d−ℓ(µ) mµ). For
both Inequalities (2.5) and (2.9), we have explicitly checked by explicit computer algebra
calculations that we do indeed have Schur-positivity for all possible cases of µ ⊢ d with
1 ≤ ad, bd ≤ 12.

3. Schur Inclusions

The following considerations (greatly) extend the second observation of [3, Conjecture
III]. We now consider s-positive diﬀerence of operators. From the point of view of repre-
sentation theory, this corresponds to inclusion of graded Sn-modules. For our current pur-
pose, it is convenient to denote by fm,n(x; q, t) the symmetric function f (a,b)
(x; q, t), when
(m, n) = (ad, bd) and d = gcd(m, n). Then, let us write fm,n(x; q, t) (cid:22)s gm,n(x; q, t), if and
only if the diﬀerence gm,n(x; q, t) − fm,n(x; q, t) is Schur-positive. Our ﬁrst observation7 is
that

d

qα em−1,n(x; q, t) (cid:22)s em,n(x; q, t),

(3.1)

where α = α(m, n) is the number of cells between the corresponding staircase paths (see (5.9)
for the deﬁnition of the (m, n)-staircase path). At t = 1, we may explain combinatorially
that

em,n(x; q, 1) − qα em−1,n(x; q, 1) ∈ N[q][e1, e2, . . .],

(3.2)

since the diﬀerence between the right-hand side and left-hand side corresponds to a weighted
enumeration of the (m, n)-Dyck paths that cannot be obtained from (m − 1, n)-Dyck paths
by the simple addition of a ﬁnal horizontal step. On the other hand, the Schur-positivity
of (3.1) is surprising, since suggests that there is some “dinv” weight-correcting injection
between (m − 1, n)-Dyck paths and (m, n)-Dyck paths. Such a correction seems far from
obvious.

To state our next observed property, we need to introduce the following linear operator.
For a partition µ, let us denote by µ the partition obtained by removing the ﬁrst column
of µ. Then, we set sµ(x) := sµ(x), and extend linearly to all symmetric functions. We this
notation at hand, we have observed that, similarly to (3.2), we have

qα′

em,n−1(x; q, t) (cid:22)s em,n(x; q, t).

(3.3)

In this case, much as before, α′ = α′(m, n) is the number of integer points between the
(m, n − 1)-staircase path and the minimal (m, n)-staircase. For example, we have

e4,6(x; q, t) − q2 e4,5(x; q, t) = (qt7 + t8 + q2t5 + qt6 + q4t2 + q3t3 + 2 q2t4 + qt5) s0(x)

+t (q + t)(cid:0)t5 + qt3 + t4 + q3 + q2t + 2 qt2 + t3 + qt(cid:1) s1(x)
+t(cid:0)qt3 + t4 + q3 + q2t + 2 qt2 + t3 + q2 + 2 qt + t2(cid:1) s2(x)
+t (q + t) s3(x) + (q + t)(cid:0)t3 + q2 + qt + 2 t2 + q + t(cid:1) s21(x)

+ (q + t) s31(x) +(cid:0)q2 + qt + t2(cid:1) s22(x)

+4 qt3 + 2 t4 + q2t + qt2) s11(x)

Among other interesting inequalities, we have

q (−1)js(a,b)

(−1)j−1s(a,b)

(j | k)(x; q, t),

correspond to the Schur-positive diﬀerences

The compositional (ad, bd)-shuﬄe conjecture implies inequality (3.4). Indeed, we have the
identity (shown in [3])

(−q)j−1Xα⊢k

CjCα(1) = s(j | k)(x) +

1
q

s(j+1 | k−1)(x).

This also shows that settling the compositional (ad, bd)-shuﬄe conjecture would answer in
the aﬃrmative the ﬁrst part of Question-1 for any hook shapes (see [11, Proposition 5.3]).

For all (m, n), we have also observed (calculating all cases for m, n ≤ 8) that the following

inequality seems to hold

qβ em−1,n(x; q, t) (cid:22)s (−qt)1−dhm,n(x; q, t),

(3.5)

with β = α(m, n) − d + 1, for d = gcd(m, n). In other words, this is the number of points
that lie between the diagonal avoiding (m, n)-staircase path, and the (m − 1, n)-staircase
path. Once again, there seems to be a transpose version of this

(3.6)
with β′ deﬁned suitably. Together with (3.4), inequality (3.5) reﬁnes the inequality in (3.1).
Hence we are led to ask the following:

em,n−1(x; q, t) (cid:22)s (−qt)1−d hm,n(x; q, t),

qβ ′

Question. 3. Can we prove that, for all coprime a, b ≥ 1, all j and k, and all m, n ≥ 1,
inequalities (3.4) and (3.5) hold?

As well as

Question. 4. Can we prove that, for all pair m, n ≥ 1, inequalities (3.3) and (3.6) hold?

Preferably, these “facts” would be explained in terms of inclusion of bigraded representations.
Observe that, up to applying a sequence of such inclusions, we may include any of the relevant
expressions as subexpressions of ∇a(en) = ean,n(x; q, t) (see (2.8)) which is conjectured to

n of the generalized diagonal
coinvariant Sn-module9. Hence, Schur-positivity of the above diﬀerences would imply that

we have bigraded-monomorphism between associated Sn modules, all of which included in
C(a)
n , for a large enough. Experiments suggest that these modules are ideals, generated by
correctly chosen lowest degree components.

Transpose sub-symmetry. Following a somewhat diﬀerent track, we have another kind
of inclusion involving a matrix like “transposition”. This seems to be a very general phe-
nomenon that we have checked for all positive seeds considered here, as well as in the cases
that correspond to the compositional (ad, bd)-shuﬄe conjecture (see [4]). The most general
question may be coined as follows:

Question. 5. Can we prove that

(3.7)

We underline that the functions f (b,a)
(x; q, t) are of diﬀerent degrees; equal
to ad in the ﬁrst case, and bd in the second. Hence they can only be compared after
applying the (−) operator, which results in a symmetric function having components of
various degrees. For example, we have

(x; q, t) and f (a,b)

As alluded to above, statement (3.7) has been checked by explicit computer algebra
calculations for all cases involving either (−qt)−ι(µ)s(a,b)
(x; q, t), or
C (a,b)
(x; q, t), for all partitions µ, all compositions α, and all coprime pairs (a, b) for which
the overall degree of the resulting function is at most 12. Hence it holds for all situations
that can be expressed as positive linear combinations of these.

4. e-Positivity and Specializations at t = 1, and t = 1 + r

Our next considerations concern an interesting feature of the specialization of the oper-
ators at t = 1. Indeed, the resulting operators appear to be much simpler operators than
their general counterpart. Indeed, one observes experimentally10 that

= f (a,b)

d

(x; q, 1) · g(x).

(4.1)

10This will be supported by actual results in the sequel.

Θa,b(fd)(g(x))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1

10

responds to multiplication of g(x) by the ﬁxed symmetric function f (a,b)
(x; q, 1). In other
words, at t = 1, the monomorphism Θa,b may be considered as graded-algebra homomor-
phism

d

This states that the eﬀect of the operator Θa,b(fd)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1
Λd −→Md≥0

:Md≥0

on any symmetric function g(x) cor-

sending fd to (multiplication by) f (a,b)
grading, d 7→ bd. Implicit in statement (4.1) is the “multiplicativity”

d

(x; q, 1). Notice here the “multiplicative” shift in

Θa,b(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1

Λbd.

(fd gk)(a,b)(x; q, 1) = f (a,b)
Thus all of this would follow from the following:

d

k

(x; q, 1).

(4.2)

f (a,b)

operates by multiplication by

Observe that it is clearly suﬃcient to answer this question for any given family of algebraic

Question. 6. Can we prove that the operator Θa,b(fd)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1
generators of Λ, say {qd}d∈N or {ed}d∈N. Recall also from [3] that e∇, the linear operator
(x; q, 1), then Θa+b,b(fd)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1
Proposition 1. If Θa,b(fd)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1

obtained from ∇ by specializing t to 1, is multiplicative. Hence, we get the following.

(x; q, 1).

d

d

Proof. Using (1.7) and (2.6) specialized at t = 1, we calculate that, for any symmetric
function g(x),

Θa+b,b(fd)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1(g(x)) = e∇Θa,b(fd)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1e∇−1(g(x))

which shows the required property.

Observe also that, to answer Question-6 positively in all instances, we need only show

that Θa,b(ed)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1 operates by multiplication. To this end, let us recall the following conjec-
(zi − qzj)(zi − tzj)!
Θa,b(ed)(g(x)) = CT g[x + M Pm

(zi − zj)(zi − qtzj)

We use here the notation

for the dual Cauchy kernel11.

Ω′[x; z] :=Xn≥0

en(x) zn

Specializing at t = 1 this constant term formula, one ﬁnds the following further support

for the “fact” that our operators have this multiplicative property at t = 1.

Proposition 2. Let (m, n) be equal to (ad, bd), with d = gcd(m, n), then Negut’s conjecture
implies that

Θa,b(ed)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=1(g(x)) = CT  1

zm,n

It is noteworthy that a combinatorial argument, discussed in [4], shows that the constant
term involved in the right-hand side of (4.3) corresponds to the enumeration of (m, n)-Dyck
paths by area and risers, that is

em,n(x; q, 1) = CT  1

with the sum running over the set of (ad, bd)-Dyck paths. One easily gets a similar constant
term formula for the enumeration of (m, n)-Dyck paths with no return to the diagonal,
except at both ends. To this end, one simply replaces zm,n by zm,n/(z1z2 · · · zm), and it
corresponds (conjecturally) to the specialization at t = 1 of a constant term formula for
(−q)1−dh(a,b)

(x; q, t).

d

Another interesting feature of this specialization at t = 1 is made apparent for special
seeds. Indeed, for these special cases, the symmetric function f (a,b)
(x; q, 1) appears to expand
with coeﬃcients in N[q] in the basis of elementary symmetric functions eµ, for µ partitions
of bd. It is usual to say that they are e-positive. If f is e-positive, we write 0 ≤e f . This is
clearly stronger than Schur-positivity, since it is classical that each eµ is itself Schur-positive.
In fact, an even stronger version of e-positivity seems to be at play here, as stated by the
following, which has been checked explicitly for all j + k = d − 1, and all a, b such that
1 ≤ ad, bd ≤ 8.

d

Question. 7. Can we prove that

0 ≤e (−1)1−kh(a,b)
q (−1)js(a,b)

d

(x; q, 1 + r),

and

(j+1 | k−1)(x; q, 1 + r) ≤e (−1)j−1s(a,b)

(j | k)(x; q, 1 + r),

for all j + k = d − 1, and all coprime a, b ≥ 1?

Exploiting the transitivity of the order, this implies that (−1)j−1s(a,b)
e-positive, since hd(x) = s(d−1|0)(x). This also implies (setting r = 0) that

(j | k)(x; q, 1 + r) itself is

0 ≤e e(a,b)

d

(x; q, 1),

and

0 ≤e q(a,b)

d

(x; q, 1),

11The Cauchy kernel Ω[x; z], obtained by replacing en(x) replaced by hn(x), is naturally related to the

standard scalar product of symmetric functions.

are

(x; q, 1) = q3 e6(x) + q2e51(x) + q e42(x) + e33(x),
(x; q, 1) = q6 e6(x) + q4 (q + 1) e51(x) + q2 (q2 + 2) e42(x)

+q3e411(x) + q3e33(x) + q (q + 2) e321(x) + e222(x),
(x; q, 1) = q8 e6(x) + q5 (q2 + q + 1) e51(x) + q4(q2 + 2) e42(x)

+q3(q2 + q + 1) e411(x) + q2 (q3 + 2 q2 + 2 q + 1) e33(x)
+q (q3 + 3 q2 + q + 2) e321(x) + q2e3111(x)
+q2e222(x) + (q + 1) e2211(x)2.

Now, as discussed in [4], the e-positive symmetric functions f (a,b)
(x; q, 1) considered often
appear to expand as a weighted sum, over combinatorial objects, of powers of q multiplied
by some elementary symmetric function, giving a combinatorial explanation why they are
e-positive. The relevant combinatorial objects are discussed in Appendix A.

d

It is interesting to underline the following fact, which reduces the proof of e-positivity

to the cases where a ≤ b.

Proposition 3. If f (a,b)

d

(x; q, 1) is e-positive, then so is f (a+b,b)

d

(x; q, 1).

Proof. Recall from [3] that on top of e∇ being is multiplicative, we have that e∇(ek) is e-
positive. Hence, e∇(eλ) = Qk∈λe∇(ek) is e-positive for all λ, and we get the announced

(x; q, 1) by applying e∇ to the e-positive expression f (a,b)

(x; q, 1).
(cid:3)

property since we get f (a+b,b)

d

d

Many other instances of e-positivity seem to occur, but they still have to be explained
combinatorially. A tantalizing fact along these lines, discussed in [9, see Prop 2.3.4], is that
the expression

hp1(x)n, en,n(x, 1, 1 + r)i

enumerates connected graphs, r-weighted by the number of edges. Extensive experiments,
including all cases of degree ≤ 8, lead to the following.

Question. 8. Can we prove that, for any partition µ of d, and any coprime a, b ≥ 1, that

0 ≤e (−1)d−ℓ(µ) m(a,b)

µ

(x; q, 1 + r),

(4.5)

in other words, that the symmetric functions are e-positive? Furthermore, can we explain
this e-positivity in terms of a combinatorial enumeration in the style of (4.4)?

For example, we have

−m(1,1)

21

(x; q, 1 + r) = 2 e1(x)3 +(cid:0)q2r + qr2 + 3 q2 + 4 q r + 2 r2 + 5 q + 6 r(cid:1) e1(x)e2(x)

+(cid:0)q3r + q2r2 + qr3 + 3 q3 + 3 q2r + 4 qr2 + 2 r3 + 5 q r + 4 r2(cid:1) e3(x).

13

Positive answers to these and Question-6 would imply many relations between e-positive
expression. For instance, one obtains Bizley-like formulas in the form

e(a,b)
d

h(a,b)
d

Xd≥0

and

(4.6)

(4.7)

Other interesting observations concern the compositional (ad, bd)-shuﬄe conjecture of [4],
specialized at t = 1. Indeed, as discussed in [11], the evaluation at 1 of the operator Cα
specializes, at t = 1, to the product of the (−1)k−1hk with k running over parts of α, where
α is a composition of d. Hence, modulo our above observations and if (2.2) holds, we should
have

qarea(γ)eρ(γ),

(4.8)

C (a,b)

α

(x; q, 1) =Xγ

where γ runs over the set of (m, n)-Dyck paths that return to the diagonal at the points

(a αi, b αi),

for αi = k1 + . . . + ki,

with i varying between 0 and ℓ. Thus, some cases that are common to (4.5) and (4.8) are
consequences of the (2.2), in particular this is so for em,n(x; q, 1).

Using the combinatorial interpretation (4.8), we may readily see that the specialization
at t = 1 of (3.1) and (3.5) hold. In fact, the relevant diﬀerences are in fact e-positive, since
we have inclusion between the sets of paths enumerated by each expression. Hence we get
the following.

Proposition 4. For all m and n,

qα em−1,n(x; q, 1) ≤e em,n(x; q, 1),
qβ em−1,n(x; q, 1) ≤e

and
(−qt)1−dhm,n(x; q, 1).

(4.9)

(4.10)

This raises the question of whether we have the stronger e-positivity property considered

earlier in other instances, namely

Question. 9. Can we prove that

qα em−1,n(x; q, 1 + r) ≤e em,n(x; q, 1 + r),
qβ em−1,n(x; q, 1 + r) ≤e

and
(−qt)1−dhm,n(x; q, 1 + r).

(4.11)

(4.12)

for all m, n ≥ 1, and explain this combinatorially?

These statements have been explicitly checked to hold for all m, n ≤ 8.

5. Specialization at q = t = 1

to the number of copies of the alternating representations in Mfd. In other words, it is the

Other specializations. Some other possibilities of specializing q and t have been considered
in the “classical” context of en,n(x; q, t), and then taking scalar product with pn
1 . For instance,
in [13], the authors set t = −1 and q = 1, for which they get interesting combinatorial
considerations. A similar specialization, followed by a scalar product with pn
1 , seems to give
rise to many interesting combinatorial questions when one considers f (a,b)
(x; q, t) for seeds
such as considered here.

Appendix A: Combinatorics of (m, n)-Dyck paths

Recall that an (m, n)-Dyck paths is a south-east lattice path, going from (0, n) to
(m, 0), which stays above the (m, n)-diagonal. This is the line segment joining (0, n) to
(m, 0). See Figure 1 for an example.

Figure 1. The (10, 5)-Dyck path encoded as 00367.

We encode such paths as (weakly) increasing integer sequences (words)

γ = a1a2 · · · an,

with 0 ≤ ak ≤ (k − 1) m/n.

Each ak gives the distance between the y-axis of the (unique) south step that starts at level
n + 1 − k. If d = gcd(m, n), we may only have equality ak = (k − 1) m/n when k = j b + 1,
for 0 < j < d. If this is the case, we say that we have a return to the diagonal at position k.
The set of such return positions may be encoded as a composition of d. This uses the classical
correspondence between subsets of {1, . . . , d − 1} and compositions α of d. To a composition
α = (c1, . . . , ck) this correspondence associates the set of partial sums S(α) = {s1, s2, . . . , sk},
where

si = c1 + c2 + · · · + ci,

with

1 ≤ i < k.

The (m, n)-Dyck that stays “closest” to the diagonal is called the (m, n)-staircase path

δm,n := d1d2 · · · dn,

with

dk := ⌊(k − 1) m/n⌋.

(5.9)

For example, we have

δ4,4 = 0123,
δ1,4 = 0000,
δ5,4 = 0123,
δ8,4 = 0246,
δ9,4 = 0246, δ10,4 = 0257, δ11,4 = 0258, δ12,4 = 0369.

δ3,4 = 0012,
δ7,4 = 0135,

δ2,4 = 0011,
δ6,4 = 0134,

It is easy to check that δkn,n = δkn+1,n. We denote by Dm,n, the set of (m, n)-Dyck paths,
and by Cm,n its cardinality. For example, we have

D5,4 = {0000, 0001, 0002, 0003, 0011, 0012, 0013, 0022, 0023, 0111, 0112, 0113, 0122, 0123}.

It follows from the observation that δkn,n = δkn+1,n, that we have the set equality

Dkn,n = Dkn+1,n.

(5.10)

When m and m are coprime, the enumeration of (m, n)-Dyck path is given by the “well”
known formula

Cm,n =

1

n (cid:19).
m + n(cid:18)m + n

For the more general situation, when m and n have greatest common divisor d ≥ 1, the
formula was obtained by Bizley [6] in 1954. His argument may be given a more general
understanding, using a symmetric function encoding of the multiplicities of parts in (m, n)-
Dyck paths. To this end, we consider the riser composition ρ(γ) of a path γ, which is
simply the sequence of multiplicities of the entries of γ. We may then count (m, n)-paths
with weight eρ(γ)(x) := er1(x)er2(x) · · · erk (x), if ρ(γ) = r1r2 · · · rk.

Let (m, n) = (ad, bd), with a and b coprime. It may be shown that (see [4])

q(a,b)
d

(x; 1, 1) :=

d
m

en[m, x],

in which one considers m as a constant13 for the pletystic evaluation of the right-hand side.
Then, a symmetric function version of Bizley’s formula may be written as

eρ(γ)(x).

Recall that, for a partition µ of d having ci parts of size i, the integers zµ are deﬁned as

Expressed in generating function terms, formula 5.11 takes the form

For example, we have

One obtains Bizley’s formula as the coeﬃcient of en(x) in the resulting elementary symmetric
function expansion. Bizley also obtained a formula for the number of primitive (ad, bd)-
Dyck paths. These are the paths that remain strictly above the diagonal (except at both

From this, we may easily enumerate (m, n)-Dyck paths with speciﬁed return positions to the
diagonal.

Area of (m, n)-Dyck paths. The area of an (m, n)-Dyck path α is the number of cells14
lying entirely between the path α and the (m, n)-staircase:

aream,n(α) :=

dk − ak,

(5.14)

nXi=k

where the δm,n = d1 · · · dn is the (m, n)-staircase. In particular, δm,n is the unique (m, n)-
Dyck path having area zero.

Parking functions, and dinv statistic. An (m, n)-parking function is simply a permuta-
tion of the entries of an (m, n)-Dyck path. It may be represented as a labeling of the south
steps of the path. To this end, a step is labeled i if the corresponding entry appears in the
ith-position in a parking function π. If this step starts at (x, y), we write π(x, y) = i. In
other words, i appears in the cell having coordinates (x, y). This is illustrated in Figure 3,
for the parking functions such that π(0, 0) = 2, π(0, 1) = 4, π(3, 2) = 3, π(6, 3) = 1, and
π(7, 4) = 5.

As illustrated in Figure 4, the (m, n)-rank of a cell (x, y) is deﬁned as being equal to
rank(x, y) := n m − y m − x n. The descent set des(π) of a parking function π is the set
of i (< n) for which i + 1 sits in a cell of lower or equal rank to that of the cell in which i
appears, hence

des(π) := {i | π(x, y) = i, π(u, v) = i + 1, rank(x, y) ≥ rank(u, v)}.

14These are the 1 × 1 squares in the N × N-grid, and they are labeled by their southwest corner.

We write comp(π) for the composition of n that encodes this subset of {1, . . . , n − 1}. In
the next section, we will need to consider composition indexed Schur functions. These are
obtained by extending to compositions the classical Jacobi-Trudi formula. More explicitly,
for a composition α = (c1, · · · , ck), one sets

sα(x) := det(hci−i+j(x))1≤i,j≤k.

It may easily be seen that this evaluates either to 0, or to a single Schur function up to a
sign.
