Bifurcation of Transition Paths Induced by Coupled Bistable Systems

Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, Blegdamsvej 17, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark

Chengzhe Tian∗ and Namiko Mitarai†

(Dated: March 16, 2016)

We discuss the transition paths in a coupled bistable system consisting of interacting multiple
identical bistable motifs. We propose a simple model of coupled bistable gene circuits as an exam-
ple, and show that its transition paths are bifurcating. We then derive a criterion to predict the
bifurcation of transition paths in a generalized coupled bistable system. We conﬁrm the validity of
the theory for the example system by numerical simulation. We also demonstrate in the example
system that, if the steady states of individual gene circuits are not changed by the coupling, the
bifurcation pattern is not dependent on the number of gene circuits. We further show that the
transition rate exponentially decreases with the number of gene circuits when the transition path
does not bifurcate, while a bifurcation softens this decrease. Finally we show that multiplicative
noises facilitate the bifurcation of transition paths.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Bistable systems are widely utilized to model the bio-
logical processes which exhibit distinct phenotypes under
homogeneous conditions [1–3]. Switching between phe-
notypes (stable states) is facilitated by the stochasticity
arising from molecular noise [4]. The paths of switching
have been studied in various systems, such as the λ-phage
lysis-lysogeny decision [5] and cellular development and
diﬀerentiation [6], to gain insights into the molecular pro-
cesses of biological decision making.

In nature, we sometimes observe situations where mul-
tiple bistable systems are coupled. For example in bacte-
rial quorum sensing, every cell produces small signaling
molecules whose production is regulated by a positive
feedback to synchronize the population. This positive
feedback may induce bistability between the high and
low concentrations of the signaling molecules. The cells
are further coupled by secreting and sensing the signal-
ing molecules in the medium[7, 8]. Another example is
the Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) loci in Escherichia coli, where
there are 10 known mRNase toxins and every pair may
act as a bistable system allowing the cells to switch be-
tween the normal growing state and the dormant state
which exhibits antibiotic persistence [9–11]. The TA sys-
tems may interact each other by interfering the protein
synthesis and the cellular growth.

Motivated by these systems, in this paper we analyze a
coupled bistable system that consists of interacting iden-
tical bistable motifs. We consider the case where coupling
is such that the coupled system itself is also bistable and
for each stable state the individual motifs are in the same
steady state. In other word, the coupling is positive to
allow all the bistable motifs to jointly switch from one
state to the other state. While the individual bistable
systems without coupling show the same pattern of tran-
sition paths by deﬁnition, the switching properties of the

∗ chengzhe@nbi.dk

coupled system remain unclear. The individual systems
may transit synchronously at the same pace, resulting in
one transition path. However, it is also possible that in-
dividual systems lead the switching process. As a result,
the transition paths of the coupled system are split into
multiple ones, a phenomenon which we call ”bifurcation
of transition path”. Since many properties of the coupled
system, such as the transition rates between the steady
states, are dependent on the transition paths, it is inter-
esting to study whether the transition paths of a given
coupled bistable system bifurcate and how this bifurca-
tion relates to the individual bistable systems and their
coupling.

In this work, we ﬁrst construct a model of coupled
bistable gene circuits in Section II. Then we demonstrate
that the transition paths bifurcate with appropriate pa-
rameter sets. In Section III, we construct a general for-
mulation of coupled bistable systems. We consider the
transition of this general model between its steady states
as a noise-induced exit process from a metastable state
and propose a criterion for the bifurcation of transition
paths by extending the previous works on the Maier-Stein
model [12]. In Section IV, we apply our criterion to the
model of coupled bistable gene circuits. We conﬁrm the
theory numerically and discuss the transition rates. Fi-
nally in Section V, we show that the additive and mul-
tiplicative noise in the model give diﬀerent bifurcation
pattern of transition paths.

II. MODEL OF COUPLED BISTABLE GENE

CIRCUITS

Consider a model of coupled bistable gene circuits (Fig.
1a). First we restrict our attention to one gene. The
promoter of the gene is weak and the proteins of this gene
bind to the promoter in the form of tetramers to activate
the gene expression. We may model the proteins of this
gene using

dx
dt

= k0 + k1

x4

x4 + S 4 − γx

(1)

where x is the concentration of the protein, k0 refers to
the basal synthesis rate of the protein, the Hill term de-
scribes the activation of gene expression by the tetramers
and the last term models the linear degradation. With
appropriate parameter values, the positive feedback on
gene expression allows Eq. 1 to show bistability.

We now couple n such genes in one cell and we assume
that all these genes (and their promoters and proteins)
have the same kinetic properties. The genes are coupled
in a way that the proteins of the genes are well-mixed in
the cells and the mixture activates a cell by binding to a
promoter in a tetramer. Multiple coupling strategies may
be used. For example, if the proteins of the n genes are
identical, any four monomers may bind a promoter and
we may model the coupled bistable gene circuits using

dxi
dt

= k0 + k1

(x1 + ··· + xn)4

(x1 + ··· + xn)4 + S 4

1 − γxi

(2)

where xi is the concentration of the products of the i-th
gene and S1 is the Hill constant for the coupled system.
Meanwhile, if the genes are equipped with identical pro-
moters but encode diﬀerent proteins, and the tetramer
activating the gene expression consists of four monomers
from the same gene, we model the coupled system using

dxi
dt

= k0 + k1

x4
1 + ··· + x4
x4
1 + ··· + x4

n

n + S 4

2 − γxi

(3)

We then generalize these examples and we propose the

following model of coupled bistable gene circuits

dxi
dt

= k0 + k1

¯x4

¯x4 + S 4 − γxi, ¯x =  1

n

xα

i!1/α

n

Xi=1

(4)

where the parameter α, called the conﬁguration parame-
ter, governs the general coupling strategy. It is straight-
forward that α = 1 corresponds to Eq. 2 and α = 4
corresponds to Eq. 3. Here we allow α to be arbitrary
positive values, though not all coupling strategies are bi-
ologically plausible. We also choose the values of the Hill
constants (S1 in Eq. 2 and S2 in Eq. 3) such that the
steady states of every individual gene are not aﬀected
by the coupling.
If the model for one gene (Eq. 1) is
bistable, it is straightforward that the general model of
coupled bistable gene circuits (Eq. 4) is also bistable and
contains three steady states: two stable ones and one sad-
dle. Furthermore, one can show that x1 = x2 = ··· = xn
holds at every steady state. For convenience, throughout
this work we call the stable state where the concentra-
tions of all gene products are low the ”lower stable steady
state” xl and the other stable steady state the ”higher
stable steady state” xh.

If we set the volume of the cell to be V , the concentra-
tions of proteins xi can be converted to the absolute num-
bers of molecules (= V xi, should be an integer) and the
coupled system is governed by the chemical master equa-
tion. One may then sample the transition paths between
the two steady states using the Gillespie algorithm [13].

FIG. 1. (Color online) Model of coupled bistable gene circuits.
a. A schematic illustration of the model. A cell contains n
genes with weak promoters and their products mix in the cell
and activate the gene expression by binding to the promot-
ers in the form of tetramers. b. Distribution of transition
paths from the lower stable steady state (xl) to the higher
one (xh). We set V = 30 and we carry out 200 simulations
using Gillespie algorithm. The distribution of the last in-
stanton trajectories, i.e. the trajectories associated with the
successful escapes, is calculated and plotted in the form of
heat plots. Red indicates high frequency and blue indicates
low frequency. The parameter values are k0 = 0.1, k1 = 1,
S = 1 and γ = 0.5.

Here we restrict our attention to n = 2 and the transi-
tion from the lower stable steady state to the higher one.
As illustrated in Fig. 1b, when α = 1, the transition
paths are narrowly distributed around the diagonal (the
line satisfying x1 = x2), suggesting that the switching of
the two genes is synchronized. The distribution becomes
wider as the value of α increases, and at α = 8, the
transition paths exhibit a visible bifurcation. Therefore,
coupled bistable systems are capable of exhibiting both
bifurcating and non-bifurcating transition paths, and we
can modulate the bifurcation pattern for the model of
coupled bistable gene circuits with the parameter α.

III. THEORY

In this section we develop a criterion for coupled
bistable systems to predict whether the transition paths
bifurcate or not. To formulate a general model for cou-
pled bistable systems, we notice that in the model of
coupled bistable gene circuits (Eq. 4), every gene is gov-
erned by the concentration of its own protein (xi, in the
degradation term) and the average concentration of all
proteins (¯x, in the production term). Here for a general
coupled bistable system, we may model the determinis-
tic drifts of the individual bistable systems in the same
fashion and describe the eﬀect of noises using

dxi
dt

i=1 xα

= f (xi, h(x)) + √ǫpg(xi, h(x))ξi, i = 1, 2,··· , n

function h, deﬁned as h(x) = (Pn

(5)
which is interpreted as an Ito-type stochastic diﬀerential
equation. Here xi is the state of the i-th bistable sys-
tem and n is the number of systems to be coupled. The
i /n)1/α, computes
the average state. We choose this formulation because
it allows modulating of α and n without changing the
steady states. Obviously, the state of every individual
bistable system is governed by its own state and the av-
erage state of all bistable systems, as modeled by the
deterministic drift f . The second term of Eq. 5 arises
from expanding the chemical master equation in the con-
tinuous limit and serves as the noise term for the cou-
pled bistable systems. Here ξi are independent Gaussian
white noise sources (hξi(t)ξj (t′)i = δi,jδ(t − t′)) and we
assume the multiplicative noise g(xi, h(x)) for the i-th
system is also a function of its own state and the av-
erage state. The overall noise is modulated by a small
parameter 0 < ǫ ≪ 1 in order to keep the validity of the
continuous limit. We assume that the deterministic drift
with n = 1 gives three steady states - two stable ones
and an unstable one. We further assume the coupled
system also allows three steady states - two stable ones
and a saddle point. At each steady state, the states of all
bistable systems are assumed to be equal. A wide range
of coupled bistable systems may be modeled in the fash-
ion of Eq. 5. For example, the model of coupled bistable
system, as mentioned in Section II, corresponds to

f (u, v) = k0 + k1v4/(v4 + S 4) − γu

and a noise amplitude of the form

g(u, v) = k0 + k1v4/(v4 + S 4) + γu

(6)

(7)

[14]. The parameter α in h(x) corresponds to the cou-
pling mode of the genes and the small ǫ corresponds to
a cell with a large volume V (in the large volume limit,
ǫ ∝ V −1).
We derive our criterion by performing linear perturba-
tion analysis in the zero-noise limit. When the noise level
of a system reaches zero (ǫ → 0), the transition between
stable steady states is dominated by the path(s) associ-
ated with the lowest energy cost (or ”action” in standard

3

terminology). This path is called the Most Probable Es-
cape Path (MPEP)[15]. The MPEP can be quantiﬁed
analytically since it is governed by the Freidlin-Wentzell
Hamiltonian [16], allowing ones to use the tools of ana-
lytical mechanics for derivation.

One property of MPEP in conventional cases is that
the MPEP of transition passes through the saddle of the
system (refer to [17]) and after that the system follows
the deterministic ﬂow to the ﬁnal stable steady state [15].
In our formulation of coupled bistable systems Eq. 5, the
individual bistable systems are always driven by the same
deterministic drift after passing the saddle. We then con-
clude that no bifurcation of transition paths will occur
between saddle and the ﬁnal steady state. Therefore, the
transition capable of bifurcation is the one from the ini-
tial stable steady state to the saddle, and we may restrict
our attention to this exit process.

The exit process may be studied with the approach of
linear perturbation. To be precise, we ﬁrst assume that
the MPEP does not bifurcate, i.e. all the bistable sys-
tems take the same state during the transition. We then
perturb the shape of MPEP by allowing some bistable
systems to be in diﬀerent states from the others during
transition and we examine how the associated actions for
the perturbed MPEP change. If the actions always in-
crease regardless of the perturbation, the non-bifurcating
path is locally energetically favorable. For the model of
coupled bistable gene circuits, we conﬁrm by numerical
simulation that this path is indeed the MPEP. Mean-
while, if any perturbation leads to a decreased action, the
non-bifurcating path is energetically unfavorable. The
MPEP should then be some other paths. Due to the
symmetry of the coupled system, multiple paths must
exist. Therefore, the coupled system exhibits a bifurca-
tion of transition paths.

We now follow this approach and we begin our analysis
by deriving the equation governing the MPEP, closely
following the procedure found in previous work[12, 17].
The model of the coupled bistable system Eq. 5, viewed
as a stochastic diﬀerential equation, gives the Fokker-
Planck equation [18]

∂
∂t

P (x, t) = −∇ · (FP (x, t)) +

ǫ
2∇ · [∇ · (GP (x, t))] (8)
where P (x, t) denotes the probability of the coupled
system at state x and time t. The drift vector F =
[F1, F2,··· , Fn]′ satisﬁes Fi = f (xi, h(x)) and the covari-
ance G is a diagonal matrix satisfying Gi,i = g(xi, h(x)).
As the initial condition, we use a delta function at the
initial stable steady state. The separatrix of the basins
gives an absorbing boundary condition. In the zero-noise
limit, ∂P (x, t)/∂t ≈ 0 and we replace P (x, t) by the
quasi-steady state distribution Pss(x) governed by [19]

− ∇ · (FPss(x)) +

ǫ
2∇ · [∇ · (GPss(x))] = 0

(9)

We further assume the quasi-steady state distribution
to take an Arrhenius form Pss(x) ∝ exp{−W (x)/ǫ},

where W (x) is the quasi-potential[20]. We perform a
WKB expansion by plugging the form into Eq. 9 and
keeping the terms of the lowest order of ǫ. One can
show that the MPEP of the transition is a classical zero-
energy trajectory of the Freidlin-Wentzell Hamiltonian
2 pT G(x)p + F(x)T p, where the momentum
H(x, p) = 1
vector can be computed by p = ∇W (x)[17]. The equa-
tion H = 0 can be viewed as the equation governing the
MPEP, but it is worth noting that not all trajectories
satisfying H = 0 are the MPEPs, as one has to examine
the associated actions.
We now determine whether the MPEP of the transi-
tion bifurcates or not by linearly perturbing the non-
bifurcating path and examining the actions. We can
show that the non-bifurcating path is a zero-energy tra-
jectory of the Freidlin-Wentzell Hamiltonian (Appendix
A). The action associated with the non-bifurcating path
¯x = [¯x, ¯x,··· , ¯x]T can then be computed by the quasi-
potential W (x) and one may quantify how the actions
change with perturbations to this path by considering
the expansion W (¯x + ∆x) = W (¯x) + ∇W (¯x) · ∆x +
2 ∆xT∇∇W (¯x)∆x. Due to symmetry, the ﬁrst-order
term vanishes if the system is perturbed in the direc-
tions perpendicular to the non-bifurcating path. Note
that these directions are of our primary interest, and
we then discuss the second-order term and examine the
eigenvalues of the hessian matrix Z(¯x) = ∇∇W (¯x). The
equation governing the hessian matrix, computed by dif-
ferentiating the H = 0 twice over x and making use of
the Hamiltonian equation dxi/dt = ∂H/∂pi (also refer
to Ref. [12]), is

(10)

where Bi,j = ∂Fi/∂xj is a linearization of the drift
vector. The linearization of the variances gives Ci,j =
pi∂Gii/∂xj.

We may simplify Eq. 10 signiﬁcantly (details in Ap-
pendix B). By utilizing the fact that all the bistable sys-
tems share the same state along the non-bifurcating path,
we may express the hessian matrix Z = z1In×n + z21n×n,
where In×n is an n × n identity matrix and 1n×n is an
n × n one matrix. We can further express the remaining
terms, namely B, C, ∇∇Fk and ∇∇Gk,k, in a similar
fashion. By plugging the new forms into Eq. 10, we ob-
tain the equations governing z1 and z2: z1 is shown to
follow

and z2 is shown to follow Eq. A1. Here f ′

∂ 2f (u, v)/∂u2 and similar for g.
In Eq. 11, x and p
refer to the state and the momentum of every bistable
system. The two arguments to the function f and g are
x.

Here we analyze the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix
Z, namely z1 (repeat n − 1 times) and z1 + nz2, and we
need to determine the eigenvalues corresponding to per-
turbations that break the non-bifurcating assumption. In
the Appendix C we show that the eigenvalue z1 + nz2 is
only governed by one individual bistable system and it
represents the change in action along the non-bifurcating
path. So this eigenvalue is not relevant in our context
and we focus on the directions perpendicular to the non-
bifurcating path, which is given by the eigenvalue z1. We
should examine the sign of z1 along the non-bifurcating
path from the initial stable steady state to the saddle.
If z1 is always positive, the perturbation is energetically
unfavorable and the non-perturbing path is locally sta-
ble. If z1 is negative somewhere, the MPEP bifurcates
into multiple paths.

Sometimes it is convenient to express z1 as a function
of x rather than time. Based on the Freidlin-Wentzell
hamiltonian for the coupled bistable system, we have that
the momentum vector may be computed by p = G−1( ˙x−
F). In addition, the transition for the individual bistable
system satisﬁes that dx/dt = −f (x, x) since it is moving
against the deterministic drift [12]. By plugging these
relations into Eq. 11, we show that

Usually we assume that the system is equipped with a
constant, non-zero noise at the initial stable steady states
[12]. We may then solve the equation dz1/dx = 0 at
the initial stable steady states and we set the nontrivial
solution to be the initial condition, which is z1 = −2f ′
1/g.
We can integrate Eq. 12 from the initial stable steady
state to the saddle and determine whether the MPEP
bifurcates or not by looking at the sign of z1.

11 and g′′

Eq. 12 generates several insights. The ﬁrst line of Eq.
12 illustrates that the nonlinearity induces the bifurca-
tion of MPEP: f ′′
11 gives information about the
nonlinearity for a bistable system without coupling, while
α 6= 1 gives the nonlinearity created by the coupling of
the bistable system. We also notice that Eq. 12 contains
no terms of n, indicating that the bifurcation of MPEP
is not dependent on the number of bistable systems to
be coupled.

IV. APPLICATION

In this section we apply our theoretical criterion to the
model of coupled bistable gene circuits (Eq. 6-7), and we
ﬁrst consider the MPEP of the model with two coupled

genes. For the forward transition from the lower stable
steady state xl to the higher one xh, if we choose α = 1,
i.e. no nonlinearity is generated from the coupling of
the genes, and integrate Eq. 12 from xl to the saddle,
we ﬁnd that the eigenvalue z1 monotonously decreases
along the path (Fig. 2a, left panel). z1 remains positive
throughout the path, indicating that at α = 1 the MPEP
does not bifurcate. For α = 2, the nonlinearity from the
coupling of the genes drives z1 to a lower value, but z1
remains positive and the MPEP does not bifurcate as
well. For α = 3 and 4, the coupling is highly nonlinear
and z1 reaches negative values and diverges, suggesting
that the MPEP bifurcates. Meanwhile, for the backward
transition from the higher stable steady state xh to the
lower one xl, we may integrate Eq. 12 from xh to the
saddle and we ﬁnd that the eigenvalue z1 remains pos-
itive regardless of the values of α (Fig. 2b, left panel),
suggesting that the MPEP never bifurcates.

To verify our prediction, we use the geometric Mini-
mum Action Method (gMAM) [21, 22] to compute the
MPEP numerically (Fig. 2ab, right panels). As pre-
dicted, the MPEP for the forward transition with α = 1
and 2 do not bifurcate, the one with α = 3 and 4 bifur-
cate to two symmetric ones with equal actions and no
bifurcation can be observed for the backward transition.
Therefore, the predictive power of the theoretical crite-
rion is conﬁrmed and this bifurcation pattern can explain
the distribution of transition paths illustrated in Fig. 1b.
We then examine the transition rates of two coupled
genes. The action associated with the MPEP (∆W )
is deﬁned as the diﬀerence in the quasi-potential be-
tween the initial and ﬁnal stable steady states, and
one can show that the transition rate is proportional to
exp{−∆W/ǫ} [17]. We sample the conﬁguration α in a
wide range and compute the actions. In accordance with
the Maier-Stein model [12], the actions for the model of
coupled bistable gene circuits are not modulated by the
value of α if no bifurcation of MPEP exists (Fig. 3a,
n = 2). Meanwhile, in the presence of bifurcation, the
actions are driven to a lower value by this conﬁguration
parameter and the transition rates increase. In short, the
bifurcation of transition paths facilitates transition.

Finally we examine the coupling of more genes. As
predicted by the theory, the bifurcation in the transition
paths is not dependent on the number of genes and the
actions ∆W exhibit a similar dependency on α (Fig. 3a,
upper panels). Numerical simulation reveals that bifur-
cated MPEP has an interesting shape. As illustrated in
Fig. 3b for n = 5 and α = 4, we plot how the states
of individual genes diﬀer from the arithmetic average of
all states, and it shows that only one gene is in the lead-
ing position (blue curve) and the remaining ones follow
with the same states (other curves). We numerically ver-
ify that the pattern of one leading/the rest following is
the optimal one and other patterns are associated with a
higher action. This ﬁnding is consistent with the proba-
bilistic view that transient alternation in the state of one
gene against the drift is more probable than alternating

multiple simultaneously. Numerical analysis also shows
that the actions associated with non-bifurcated MPEP
scale linearly with the number of genes n, suggesting an
exponential scaling law in the transition rate. The ac-
tions for bifurcated MPEP scales sublinearly with n (Fig.
3c). This pinpoints that the bifurcation in MPEP leads
to a softer dependency between the transition rate and
the size of the system.

V. BIFURCATION AND NOISE COLOR

Throughout this work we consider the transition of
coupled bistable systems with multiplicative noise, as
the chemical Langevin equation arising from the chemical
master equation of a reaction system gives a noise vari-
ance proportional to its reaction rate [23]. Since manip-
ulating the noises is possible to sheer the MPEP [24, 25],
it is tempting to discuss how this colored noise facilitates
the transition, especially the critical α inducing bifur-
cated MPEP for forward transition, compared to white
noise.

We consider the forward transitions driven by white
noises (by setting g = 1) and numerically compute the
actions (Fig. 3a, bottom panels). We show that the

FIG. 3. (Color online) Analysis of the coupling of multiple
genes. a. The actions ∆W (deﬁned as the diﬀerence in the
quasi-potential between the initial stable steady state and the
saddle) are computed numerically for both forward transitions
(left panels) and backward transitions (right panels) and for
both colored noises (upper panels) and white noises (lower
panels). We consider the coupling of two to ﬁve genes and
sample the conﬁguration α in a wide range (the sampled val-
ues are shown in dots). The purple dashed line represents
the predicted critical α for systems with colored noises and
the red line represents the prediction for white noises. The
theory predicts that the transition paths for systems with
α = 2.5 and colored noise are bifurcated and the action be-
comes smaller. With the present numerical accuracy, we are
able to show that the transition paths are bifurcated, but not
able to ﬁnd the correct action. b. The most probable escape
path of the forward transition for systems with n = 5 and
α = 4. The horizontal axis represents the arithmetic aver-
age of the genes’ states (x = Pn
i=1 xi/n) and the vertical axis
represents the diﬀerence between the state of individual genes
and the average state (∆xi = xi − x). c. The actions ∆W of
forward transitions for multi-dimensional systems with α = 1
(no bifurcation) and 4 (bifurcation).

actions ∆W show a similar dependency on α, but the
critical α (≈ 3.3, red dashed line) is higher than the
one (around 2.4, purple dashed line) when the colored
noise is used. The diﬀerence in critical values allows us
to partition α into three ranges: in the zero-noise limit,
systems with a conﬁguration α < 2.4 show no bifurcation
in transition paths for both colored and white noises. In
conﬁgurations with 2.4 < α < 3.3, only colored noises
can induce a bifurcated MPEP. In conﬁgurations with
α > 3.3, both types of noises may induce bifurcation in
transition paths (arrow in Fig. 4). We further simulate

6

the Langevin equation with both types of noises with
typical values of α in every range and the distributions
of transition paths (heat plots) are in agreement with
the criticality in α and the zero-noise limit MPEP (black
lines). Therefore, we conclude that in the model of cou-
pled bistable gene circuits, the white and colored noises
give diﬀerent bifurcation patterns of forward transition.

VI. DISCUSSIONS

In this work, taking the model of coupled bistable gene
circuits as an example, we consider a general model of
coupled bistable systems and derive a criterion to de-
termine whether the most probable escape paths of the
transition bifurcate or not. We show that in the present
setup where the steady states are not modulated by α
and n, this criterion is independent on the number of
individual bistable systems. Furthermore, we apply our
criterion to the model of coupled bistable gene circuits
and verify the theory’s predictive power numerically. Nu-
merical analysis reveals that only one bistable system
takes the leading position in the bifurcated MPEP. We
also show that the transition rates associated with non-
bifurcated MPEP scale exponentially with the number
of bistable systems while the coupled systems with bifur-
cated MPEP exhibit a softer scaling behavior. We also
show how noise color modulates the bifurcation pattern
of transition paths.

The theoretical criterion in this work is developed for a
restricted class of systems satisfying the conditions that
every individual system is bistable and its steady states
are not aﬀected by the coupling and the MPEP passes
through the saddle of the coupled system. One may study
bifurcation of a wide range of systems by following our
procedures and making appropriate changes. For exam-
ple, it is possible to study the coupling of identical sys-
tems where every individual system is not bistable but
the coupled system is, as well as to study the coupled
systems whose the steady states are dependent on the
coupling. The saddle point could also be replaced by
the ”global maximum along the dominant path” deﬁned
by the point along the MPEP where the drift along the
path changes its sign (refer to [26]). Finally, one may
extend the theory to study the coupling of multidimen-
sional bistable systems, though one needs to numerically
search for the optimal transition path for one bistable sys-
tem and integrate z1 (now a matrix rather than a scalar)
along this path. In summary, our work provides with a
convenient method to study the bifurcation of transition
paths of coupled bistable systems and may lead to wide
range of practical insights.

in black lines. We set the time step to be 0.01 second, the ǫ of the system with colored noise to be 1/30 and the ǫ for white
noise to be 1/147.5. The noise level for systems with white noise equals to twice of the level of colored noise at lower stable

APPENDIX: DETAILED DERIVATIONS IN

THEORY

A. Non-bifurcating Path Is A Zero-Energy Path of

the Freidlin-Wentzell Hamiltonian

Here we show that the non-bifurcating path of a cou-
pled bistable system is a zero-energy trajectory of the
corresponding Freidlin-Wentzell Hamiltonian. First we
restrict our attention to one bistable system. Since it
is one-dimensional, there exists only one transition path
in the zero-noise limit and it is obviously a zero-energy
path of the corresponding Freidlin-Wentzell Hamiltonian
H1 = 1
2 p2g(x, x) + pf (x, x) = 0 where we write the
drift and variance explicitly. We then discuss the non-
bifurcating path of a coupled bistable system. Note that
at every point along the non-bifurcating path, x1 = x2 =
··· = xn = h(x) and p1 = p2 = ··· = pn hold, and we

2 pT G(x)p + FT p = n(cid:0) 1

have that the drifts for every individual bistable systems
are the same and the diagonal elements of the covariance
matrix G are equal as well. One may then express the
corresponding Freidlin-Wentzell Hamiltonian in the form
that H = 1
where we use x and p to represent the state and mo-
mentum of every bistable system.
In other words, the
coupling vanishes eﬀectively and the Hamiltonian is only
dependent on the transition of every individual bistable
system. Since the transition path of every individual sys-
tem is zero-energy, we can claim that the non-bifurcating
path of the coupled system should satisfy H = 0.

B. Computation of the Hessian Matrix Z

We compute the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix
Z = ∇∇W along the non-bifurcating path. The element
zi,j in the matrix Z contains information about the in-
teraction between the i-th and the j-th bistable systems.
Recall that all the bistable systems take the same state
along the non-bifurcating path, and we have that all the
diagonal elements should take the same value (denoted

as z1 + z2) and same for the oﬀ-diagonal elements (de-
noted as z2), though we should notice that the diagonal
elements may not equal to the oﬀ-diagonal ones. The
hessian matrix Z then takes the form of z1In×n + z21n×n
and it is straightforward to show that the eigenvalues are
z1 (repeat n − 1 times) and z1 + nz2.
The non-bifurcating path also allows us to simplify the
computation of the drifts and the noise levels in Eq. 10.
Take the drifts as an example. Since all the bistable sys-
tems take the same state, for any bistable systems i, j, k
and l (i 6= j, k 6= l), we have xi = xj = xk = xl and there-
fore Fi = Fj = Fk = Fl. The linearization of the drifts is
then Bi,j = ∂f (xi, h(x))/∂xj = f ′
2(xi, h(x))∂h(x)/∂xj .
Note that the function h is symmetric for all individual
bistable systems, and we have ∂h(x)/∂xj = ∂h(x)/∂xl.
We then show that Bi,j = f ′
2(xk, h(x))∂h(x)/∂xl =
∂f (xk, h(x))/∂xl = Bk,l. In other words, the oﬀ-diagonal
elements of the linearization matrix B take the same
value. Similarly, one can prove that the diagonal ele-
ments also take the same value and we can express B in
the form of B = f ′
2h′1n×n where the arguments
to the functions are x and h′ is deﬁned as ∂h(x)/∂xi.
Meanwhile, we may also simplify the hessian of the drift
∇∇Fk. By noticing that p1 = p2 = ··· = pn, we have
that

that C = g′

We are readily to obtain the eigenvalues of the hes-

10. By making use the facts that h′ = 1/n,
Eq.

C. Analysis of z1 + nz2

we show that this eigenvalue follows

11 + 2g′′
g′′
22 is equivalent to d2g(x, x)/dx2 and simi-
lar for the terms of f . Since f (x, x) and g(x, x) are the
drift and noise induced by one bistable system, we claim
that the eigenvalue z1 + nz2 corresponds to the direction
of perturbation where the coupling of multiple bistable
systems eﬀectively vanishes. The only possible direction
is the one along the non-bifurcating path. Therefore, the
eigenvalue z1 + nz2 should not be considered in our con-
text as it does not break the non-bifurcating assumption.
We should then focus on the eigenvalue z1, as discussed
in Section III.

[14] In fact the chemical Langevin equation derived from the
master equation contains the sum of two noises term:
one for production √ǫpk0 + k1v4/(v4 + S 4)ξi and one
for degradation √ǫ√γu ˜ξi [23], and this formulation is
used in Fig. 4. However, the theoretical criterion still ap-
plies since the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations for
the two formulations are identical.
