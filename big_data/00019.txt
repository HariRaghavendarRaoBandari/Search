ABSTRACT

X–shaped or peanut–shaped (X/P) bulges are observed in more than 40% of
(nearly) edge-on disc galaxies, though to date a robust method to quantify them is
lacking. Using Fourier harmonics to describe the deviation of galaxy isophotes from
ellipses, we demonstrate with a sample of 11 such galaxies (including NGC 128)
that the sixth Fourier component (B6) carries physical meaning by tracing this X/P
structure. We introduce ﬁve quantitative diagnostics based on the radial B6 proﬁle,
namely: its ‘peak’ amplitude (Π max); the (projected major-axis) ‘length’ where this
peak occurs (RΠ ,max); its vertical ‘height’ above the disc plane (zΠ ,max); a measure
of the B6 proﬁle’s integrated ‘strength’ (SΠ ); and the B6 peak ‘width’ (WΠ ). We also
introduce diﬀerent ‘classes’ of B6 proﬁle shape. Furthermore, we convincingly detect
and measure the properties of multiple (nested) X/P structures in individual galaxies
which additionally display the signatures of multiple bars in their surface brightness
proﬁles, thus consolidating further the scenario in which peanuts are associated with
bars. We reveal that the peanut parameter space (‘length’, ‘strength’ and ‘height’)
for real galaxies is not randomly populated, but the three metrics are inter-correlated
(both in kpc and disc scale-length h). Additionally, the X/P ‘length’ and ‘strength’
appear to correlate with (vrot/σ(cid:63)), lending further support to the notion that peanuts
‘know’ about the galactic disc in which they reside. Such constraints are important
for numerical simulations, as they provide a direct link between peanuts and their
host disc. Our diagnostics reveal a spectrum of X/P properties and could provide a
means of distinguishing between diﬀerent peanut formation scenarios discussed in the
literature. Moreover, nested peanuts, as remnants of bar buckling events, can provide
insights into the disc and bar instability history.

1 INTRODUCTION

Quite apart from the spheroid-shaped bulges observed at
the cores of many disc galaxies, some galaxy bulges display
a characteristic bi-lobed, boxy or X-like shape if viewed in
projection close to edge-on (for example, the famous IC 4767
– ‘the X-galaxy’; Whitmore & Bell 1988). Shortly after this
class of galaxy was noticed (Burbidge & Burbidge 1959) they
were coined ‘peanut’ bulges by de Vaucouleurs & de Vau-
couleurs (1972), and have since been found to occur in a
signiﬁcant fraction of galaxies (e.g., L¨utticke, Dettmar &

Pohlen 2000 found that > 40% of disc galaxies in close
to edge-on orientation and ranging from S0 to Sd have
(peanut/X)-shaped bulges; see also Jarvis 1986 and Buta
et al. 2015). Additionally, more recent works suggest that
the bulge of our own Galaxy is peanut-shaped ( Sellwood
1993; Dwek et al. 1995; Ness et al. 2012; Wegg, Gerhard &
Portail 2015).

The early analyses (based on N –body simulations) of
Combes & Sanders (1981), Combes et al. (1990) and Raha
et al. (1991), suggested that peanuts arise naturally from
the thickening and/or buckling of galactic bars, or vertical
resonance mechanisms, such as the Inner Lindblad Reso-
nance (ILR). Observational support for the peanut–bar link

quickly followed (e.g., Shaw 1987; Dettmar & Barteldrees
1990; Kuijken & Merriﬁeld 1995; Bureau & Freeman 1999;
Bureau & Athanassoula 2005), the fraction of barred disc
galaxies (∼45%; Aguerri, M´endez-Abreu & Corsini 2009)
being found to be close (within a few per cent) to that
of X/P hosts. Other than their characteristic morphology,
X/P bulges also exhibit speciﬁc kinematic signatures in face-
on orientation (Debattista et al. 2005, M´endez-Abreu et al.
2008), as well as cylindrical rotation, i.e., almost constant
rotational velocity in the direction perpendicular to the disc
plane (e.g., Molaeinezhad et al. 2016 and references therein).
The ﬁeld has advanced signiﬁcantly, with three–dimensional
simulations becoming ever more reﬁned (e.g., Quillen et al.
2014; Athanassoula et al. 2015; Li & Shen 2015) and peanuts
being detected at lower inclinations (e.g., Erwin & Debat-
tista 2013). For a more in-depth overview we refer the reader
to the review articles of Laurikainen & Salo (2016) and
Athanassoula (2016), and references therein.

Quantifying X/P structures in real galaxies has proved
a challenging feat, with most observational studies relying
on qualitative methods, such as visual inspection. Several
quantitative diagnostics have been attempted, particularly:
determining whether isophotes crossing the minor axis are
‘pinched’ or concave (Williams, Bureau & Cappellari 2009),
examining one–dimensional cuts parallel to the disc plane
(D’Onofrio et al. 1999; Athanassoula 2005) or looking for
the peanut imprint in the fourth Fourier component (B4) of
isophotes (Beaton et al. 2007; Erwin & Debattista 2013).
However, all of these approaches are problematic. As we
will show in Section 4, many peanut galaxies do not exhibit
a very prominent X/P feature compared to the disc and
spheroid. As such, their photometric structure is dominated
by the combination of the latter two, thus most often result-
ing in straight (parallel to the disc plane) or even convex
isophotes which cross the minor axis1 (where the shape is
dominated by the spheroid), despite the presence of an X/P.
Taking cuts parallel to the disc plane also works best only
for strong peanuts, and further suﬀers from noise from, e.g.,
substructure, seeing, etc. Finally, B4 usually measures the
boxyness or discyness of isophotes. However, X/P structures
are believed to be diﬀerent to boxy ellipticals (Combes et al.
1990), and in fact for edge-on galaxies the disc makes the
isophotes discy, i.e., when the isophote crosses the major
axis, it is highly convex (not concave, as would be the case
for boxy isophotes).

In this work we propose a method which is more accu-
rate, easy to automate, can probe fainter peanuts and is well
suited to compare observations (galaxy isophotes) with sim-
ulations (projected isodensity contours). Ciambur (2015),
hereafter C15, recently suggested that, just as B4 quantiﬁes
boxyness or discyness, so the sixth Fourier component of
isophotes (B6) carries physical meaning, capturing the X/P
feature. In this paper we show that B6 does trace X/peanut
structures remarkably well and provides a wealth of infor-
mation about them.

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we de-
ﬁne our ﬁve diagnostics, based on the radial B6 proﬁle, and

1 There are of course exceptions, most notably NGC 128, in
which the peanut is the dominant component, and the isophotes
crossing the minor axis are highly concave.

we additionally present them in the context of peanut for-
mation theory. Section 3 details our sample of eleven galax-
ies with known X/P structures, obtained from the litera-
ture. Section 4 provides a detailed demonstration of X/P
structure quantiﬁcation using a well known peanut galaxy,
NGC 128, as well as the results for the full sample. We in-
terpret and discuss our results in Section 5, and ﬁnally, we
re-iterate our main ﬁndings and conclude with Section 6.
Throughout this paper, we assume a ﬂat Universe cosmol-
ogy with Ωm = 0.27 and H0 = 70 km s−1 Mpc−1.

2 THEORY AND QUANTITATIVE X/P

PARAMETERS

Bars in discs are dynamically unstable, and are suscepti-
ble to buckling outside of the disc plane. Numerical simula-
tions have shown that bar buckling is one channel through
which disc galaxies can develop X/P structures (Raha et al.
1991; Merritt & Sellwood 1994). In such cases, the bar buck-
les and forms a peanut in the inner regions (Athanassoula
& Martinez-Valpuesta 2009) and the stronger the buckling,
the more pronounced is the resulting peanut. Another sce-
nario which also arose from N−body simulations is that
the peanut is actually due to a resonance mechanism (e.g.,
Combes & Sanders 1981; Combes et al. 1990), in particular
a vertical Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR). The X/P shape
is given by stellar orbits undergoing a 2:1 vertical Lindblad
Resonance:

Ωp,b = Ω − νz
2

,

(1)

where Ωp,b is the pattern rotation frequency of the bar,
Ω is the circular rotation frequency of stars in the disc, and
νz is their vertical oscillation frequency. Essentially, there
is a ‘sweet spot’ in radius where the vertical component of
stellar orbits is resonant with the bar’s pattern speed, and
for the 2:1 resonance, the stellar orbits oscillate twice per
bar rotation (i.e., each time the two ends of the bar pass
underneath). As this is a resonance, this vertical motion
enhancement causes the orbits of these stars to ‘puﬀ’ out
of the disc plane at these two points, thus leading to the
observed peanut shape in an edge-on projection. Finally,
Patsis et al. (2002) explore N -body simulations where X/P
bulges develop without a bar at all.

In order to disentangle the various mechanisms and
thus constrain galaxy dynamics, it is obviously interest-
ing to measure a number of peanut properties: the radius
where it is most prominent, how high above the disc plane
it reaches, and how strong it is, in real galaxies. Our method-
ology provides a framework for measuring these quantities
and thus allows to probe the theory via direct observa-
tions, as well as comparing real X/P galaxies among them-
selves. This framework is based on the azimuthal proﬁles of
galaxy isophotes. Throughout our work, we employed the
quasi-elliptical isophote ﬁtting software Isofit, introduced
in C15. As detailed in C15, Isofit provides a superior de-
scription of isophote deviations from pure ellipses (which
real galaxy isophotes are observed to have), than its pre-
decessor, Ellipse. These deviations are mathematically ex-
pressed as Fourier harmonics, and in Isofit, they are ex-

ure 1 for the deﬁnition of RΠ ), which illustrates the main el-
ements used in deﬁning the ﬁve X/P metrics, i.e., the peanut
‘peak’ (Πmax), the projected ‘length’ (RΠ ,max), the peak ‘width’
(WΠ ). The peanut ‘strength’ (SΠ ) is the area under the pro-
ﬁle enclosed by R1 and R2. As with the X/P length, the peanut
‘height’ (zΠ ,max) also corresponds to the isophote with maximum
B6 amplitude (Πmax).

shaped features. C15 already suggested that B6 may trace
the X/P feature in galaxies, and qualitatively explored this
possibility (see e.g., their Fig. 4). Here we demonstrate that
this is indeed the case, and we deﬁne the following peanut
diagnostics, derived from the B6 proﬁle (see Figure 2):

(i) Πmax(= B6,max) – the X/P peak, equal to the maxi-
mum B6 amplitude. The quantity B6, like all the An and Bn
coeﬃcients, is a function of radius, such that each isophote
has its own value.

(ii) RΠ ,max – the projected X/P length, equal to the
(major-axis) radius where Πmax occurs. Note that the true
length of a peanut (lΠ ,max) is only measurable from a galaxy
image when the bar is viewed perfectly side-on. As the bar’s
viewing angle (α in our notation) is unknown, we can only
calculate a lower limit of the peanut length, that is, the pro-
jected radius RΠ ,max = lΠ ,max sin(α) (α = 0◦ for end-on and
90◦ for side-on orientation). This latter quantity is straight-
forward to compute from Equation 2:

calculated at the isophote with maximum B6 amplitude,
and where ψΠ is the eccentric anomaly angle of the peanut,
given by:

with  being the isophote ellipticity.
(iii) zΠ ,max – the X/P height, equal to the vertical ex-
tent above the disc plane computed from the isophote where
Πmax occurs:

where R(ψ) is the angle-dependent radial co-ordinate of
a pure ellipse, n is the harmonic order and ψ is the azimuthal
angular co-ordinate (see Figure 1). The angle ψ is related to
the usual polar co-ordinate φ as follows. If a point on a circle
is deﬁned in polar co-ordinates (r, φ), and the circle is ‘ﬂat-
tened’ in one direction such that it becomes an ellipse, then
the same point has the new co-ordinates (R(ψ), ψ). By us-
ing the eccentric anomaly as the angular co-ordinate, Isofit
drastically improves on previous isophote-ﬁtting algorithms,
such as Ellipse.

Note that generally the harmonic coeﬃcients (An, Bn)
can have either units of length (assumed in Equation 2),
or intensity (as Isofit uses and outputs), or they can be
dimensionless. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to alternate
between units if the isophote semi-major axis and local in-
tensity gradient are known. As usually done in the literature,
we plot the dimensionless coeﬃcients (i.e., Bn in units of in-
tensity, re-normalised by the isophote semi-major axis (a)
and local intensity gradient −∂I/∂a), as given by:

In the past, quantitative studies of galactic bars have
been performed on similar principles, most notably in Ohta,
Hamabe & Wakamatsu (1990), Regan & Elmegreen 1997
and Aguerri, Beckman & Prieto 1998 (the latter in particular
use diagnostics for bar length and strength derived from
isophotal n = 2 Fourier terms), but see also Schwarz (1984)
and Buta, Laurikainen & Salo (2004). Out of all the Fourier
coeﬃcients of Equation 2, the sixth cosine coeﬃcient B6
is of particular interest in our work quantifying X/peanut–

where ZΠ ,max is the projected height and i is the inclina-
tion angle of the galaxy’s disc (such that 90◦ corresponds
to edge-on). Since X/P structures arise from vertical oscil-
lations (⊥ to the disc plane), the observed vertical extent
is diminished in proportion to the observed disc inclination.
We correct for this eﬀect for non edge-on galaxies in our

sample through the use of Equation 6, thus recovering the
true vertical extent of the peanut, zΠ ,max. We illustrate how
RΠ ,max and ZΠ ,max are derived from an isophote in Figure
1.

which we deﬁne as:

where R1 and R2 are the (major-axis) radii enclosing
the part of the B6(R) proﬁle higher than the peak half-
maximum2 (Πmax/2).

(v) WΠ – the X/P peak width, is the radial extent R2−R1.
Although the harmonic proﬁles are typically plotted as
a function of the isophotal semi-major axis, i.e., ‘a’ in Figure
1, we plot B6 as a function of RΠ (see Equation 4 and Figure
1).

In our analysis, an X/P feature can be ‘strong’ in two
ways: when it displays a high B6 amplitude, or if the peak
in the B6 proﬁle is extended over a large radial range (i.e., a
large WΠ ). This will be more clear when we present actual
B6 proﬁles in the following sections, and is illustrated here
schematically in Figure 2. Both of these cases are accounted
for in our deﬁnition of the peanut strength diagnostic, SΠ .
We chose to perform the integral in Equation 7 within the
half-maximum limits so that the X/P feature is well sepa-
rated from other potential components or the noise in the
B6 proﬁle, as B6 approaches zero. Throughout this work,
we provide the X/P length, height, strength and peak width
both in the usual angular units (arcsec), in kiloparsecs and
in units of the disc exponential scale length h. We prefer
the latter, since it is more insightful from a galaxy struc-
ture perspective, and is independent of the distance to the
galaxy.

Perhaps the most important advantage of our method
is that it is simple, practical, and constitutes an objective
and accurate way of measuring X/P structures. Moreover,
it is not restricted to the strongest and most visibly obvious
X/P bulges, but can detect and measure weaker structures,
in regions of the galaxy where additional components (such
as the bulge or the disc) dominate the isophotes.

3 DATA

It is diﬃcult to decide upon the optimal observational data
for edge-on peanut galaxies. An important consideration is
dust obscuration, which is likely to be a problem for peanut
galaxies because they are disc galaxies viewed, in the major-
ity of cases, at high inclination or close to edge-on. There-
fore, were their discs to have embedded dust lanes (which
is quite common in actively star-forming spirals), the unde-
sired obscuration would have a maximal impact. Opting for
near-infrared (NIR) imaging has the advantage of reveal-
ing X/P structures which may be contaminated (or even
completely obscured) in the visible bands by dust (Quillen

2 Variations of this can readily be envisaged, and we tested a few
but preferred Πmax/2.

et al. 1997). However, the disadvantage of NIR data is a
broader point spread function (PSF), often with strong Airy
rings. Should a galaxy contain a large number of point-like or
(small) resolved objects (such as a bright AGN, star clusters,
etc.), their light is spread by the instrumental PSF into the
diﬀuse galaxy light (i.e., the peanut, bulge, disc) and thus
introduces noise/bias in the true shape of these components.
To diminish this eﬀect, shorter wavelengths are preferable,
particularly since determining the shape of the peanut ac-
curately makes it possible to detect weak or nested peanuts,
which would otherwise be lost in the noise.

We compiled a sample of 11 nearly edge-on galaxies
with known X/P structures from the literature (Sandage
1961; Tsikoudi 1980; Jarvis 1986; de Souza & Dos Anjos
1987; Shaw 1987; Shaw, Dettmar & Barteldrees 1990). We
sourced the imaging for our sample from three archives,
namely i) the Hubble Legacy Archive3 for visible and NIR
imaging taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) ii)
Data Release 9 (DR9, Ahn et al. 2012) of the Sloan Digi-
tal Sky Survey4 (SDSS), where we generally opted for the
redder bands (r, i, z) and iii) the Spitzer Survey of Stellar
Structure in Galaxies5 (S4G, Sheth et al. 2010, Buta et al.
2015) for NIR imaging (3.6µ and 4.5µ). We decided on the
optimal source on a case-by-case basis, depending on the im-
age availability, level of dust obscuration and ﬁeld of view
size. For NGC 128 and NGC 2549, we made use of more
than one image.

Table 1 lists the full sample, together with the source
archive and bandpass (ﬁlter), as well as the morphological
classiﬁcation from the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright
Galaxies6 (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991), hereafter RC3. The
inclination angle i of each galaxy is also listed, and was cal-
culated from the axis ratio reported in Salo et al. (2015)
for the S4G galaxies, and in RC3 for the remainder, while
assuming an intrinsic thickness of an edge-on disc of 0.22
(Unterborn & Ryden 2008). The intrinsic thickness is degen-
erate with the inclination: when a disc approaches an edge-
on viewing angle, its axis ratio is dominated by its natural
thickness. For this reason, all our galaxies with an RC3 value
of b/a < 0.22 are assumed to be exactly edge-on (i = 90◦).
Additionally, Table 1 lists the physical scale (pc arcsec−1)
of each image, corrected for infall into the Virgo Cluster and
the Great Attractor, as provided by the NASA/IPAC Extra-
galactic Database7 (NED), plus the 2M ASS8 K–band mag-
nitude (MK ) of each galaxy, as listed in NED. Finally the gas
rotational velocity (vrot) and the stellar velocity dispersion
(σ(cid:63)) were retrieved from the HyperLeda9 (Makarov et al.
2014) database and are also listed in Table 1 for each galaxy.
We used the vrot of the gas reported by Giovanelli et al.
(1986), Giovanelli et al. (2007), Haynes et al. (2011) and
Braun, Thilker & Walterbos (2003) for NGC 678, NGC 4710,
NGC 4469 and NGC 7332, respectively; the stellar rota-
tional velocity reported by Bertola & Capaccioli (1977) and
Simien & Prugniel (1997) for NGC 128 and NGC2549; and

geometric parameters, such as centre position, ellipticity ()
and position angle (P A). Isofit distorts the purely elliptical
shapes at each radial location through Fourier terms (Equa-
tion 2) whose number (1 to n) are chosen at the start of the
run. The modes chosen for our analysis were n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
and 10. Brieﬂy, n = 2, 3, and 4 are the standard harmonics
used in the literature (n =2 ﬁts the  and P A, n =3 ﬁts
for asymmetry and n =4 for boxyness/discyness), whereas
n = 6, 8, 10 are higher order terms which in general are neg-
ligible but for peanut galaxies are relevant (n = 6 is in fact
crucial since this is the harmonic which describes the X/P
feature, as we will show). Because odd-numbered harmon-
ics capture ever more complicated asymmetries, we did not
include n > 3 odd terms.

The ﬁrst aspect analysed from our isophotal study was
the major axis surface brightness proﬁle µ(Rmaj), which we
subsequently decomposed into galaxy components. There
is a long history of using analytical functions to describe
the radial surface brightness proﬁles of galaxies and their
components (see Graham 2013 for a review), with multi-
component (≥ 2) decompositions routinely ﬁt these days
(e.g., Laurikainen et al. 2014; Savorgnan & Graham 2016).
The decomposition was performed with the software pro-
filer (Ciambur in prep.). profiler constructs a model
µ(Rmaj) from user-deﬁned analytical
functions (such as
S´ersic, exponential, Gaussian, etc.) each of which is intended
to describe a particular photometric component (e.g., the
disc, the bulge). The model is built by adding together all the
components and then convolving the resulting proﬁle with
the instrumental point spread function (PSF). This process
is iterated until the best-ﬁtting solution is found. profiler
employs the Levenberg-Marquardt (Marquardt 1963) min-

form -based + direct) convolution scheme. Profiler has
many desirable features, such as a fast minimisation process
(chieﬂy due to its eﬃcient convolution scheme), an intuitive
graphical user interface, and several options for the choice
of PSF proﬁle, speciﬁcally Gaussian or Moﬀat (Moﬀat 1969)
functions, or any user-provided proﬁle in the form of a ta-
ble of values. For NGC 128, the PSF was characterised by

4 ANALYSIS

4.1 Methodology: Modelling a Strong Peanut –

NGC 128

Here we demonstrate our analysis of X/P bulges on the in-
teresting, well known peanut galaxy NGC 128. This peculiar
lenticular galaxy displays a very pronounced X/P structure
(Figure 3) and is in fact the ﬁrst galaxy where such a feature
was noted (Burbidge & Burbidge 1959).
The ﬁrst image that we modelled was the SDSS r−band
image. Using Isofit, nested isophotes were ﬁt at increasing
major-axis steps, each having full freedom in varying their

tracted from the SDSS r–band image, and decomposed into its
constituent components: spheroid (red), edge-on disc (blue) and
two bars (cyan). The dashed vertical lines correspond to the semi-

ﬁtting Gaussian proﬁles to bright unsaturated stars in the
image, with the IRAF task Imexamine.

The decomposition of NGC 128’s surface brightness
proﬁle is shown in the top panel of Figure 4. In addition to
the spheroid component (red curve) and inclined disc com-
ponent (blue curve), the proﬁle also displays the signatures
of two bar components, plotted in cyan. While multiple,
nested, bars are known to occur in some galaxies (Friedli
et al. 1996, Erwin et al. 2001, Erwin 2011), this instance is
particularly interesting as the bulge of NGC 128 is peanut-
shaped, and X/P structures are known to be associated with
bars. Martinez-Valpuesta, Shlosman & Heller (2006) show
how, in their simulations, bars can undergo recurrent buck-
ling events, each giving rise to a progressively longer peanut-
shaped structure, but the X/P structures themselves do not
co-exist (they occur as single structures at diﬀerent times,
not a nested structure). For NGC 128 though, as we will
show below, each of the two co-existing bars has its own
corresponding peanut.
The second image that we investigated was a higher-
resolution image of NGC 128, taken with the N ICM OS − 3
(N IC3) instrument on board the HST . While the ﬁeld-of-
view is small, the better spatial resolution at smaller radii is
ideal to showcase the X/P feature of this galaxy, and mea-
sure it more accurately than from the SDSS r–band. Again,
the modelling was performed with Isofit, and additionally,
a two-dimensional reconstruction of the image was gener-
ated with the IRAF task Cmodel (also introduced in C15).
NGC 128 and the reconstructed image are displayed in Fig-

Figure 5. The HST /N IC3 image of NGC 128 (top) and the re-
construction with Isofit/Cmodel (bottom). The residual image
resulting from subtracting the reconstruction from the image can
be seen in the lower panel of Figure 6. Both panels have contours
overlayed (at the same intensity levels), to highlight the isophote
shapes. The two solid thick contours represent the isophotes cor-
responding to the two peaks in the B6 harmonic amplitude (see
Figure 7), while the thick dashed contours represent the isophote
with the minimum B6 amplitude between the two peaks.

ure 5. The residual image (data minus reconstruction) is
shown in Figure 6.

If we were to generate a perfect model of the galaxy,
then subtracting it from the image would produce a resid-
ual map in which the distribution of pixel values is centred
on zero, and has some inevitable dispersion due to the noise
in the data. However, failing to adequately capture a given
photometric component leads to systematics in the residual,
which broaden the pixel distribution and cause it to depart
from a (narrow) Gaussian shape. We can discern which is
the harmonic that captures the X-shape/peanut-shape from
Figure 6. The ﬁgure shows the distribution of pixel values in
the residual image (left-hand panels) and the residual image
itself (right-hand panels), for ﬁve values of the maximum
harmonic order chosen in Isofit. The ﬁrst (top) case corre-
sponds to purely elliptical isophotes (n = 0)10, for which the
residual image displays obvious (and essentially expected)
X-shaped systematics. The latter are reﬂected in the rel-
atively broad dispersion of the pixel distribution (the red
curve), which also appears to be bi-modal: the bright fea-
tures are compensated by dark features, each giving rise
to its own peak. It is notable that upgrading the model’s

10 Strictly speaking, Isofit does use the n = 2 harmonic to
adjust the ellipticity () and position angle (P A) of ellipses as
they are ﬁtted. However, once adjusted, the old ellipses distorted
by n = 2 become new ellipses with no distortions (n = 0) but
updated  and P A.

red curves represent the pixel distribution in the residual image for ﬁve upper limits in the number of harmonic terms, from top to
bottom: n = 0, i.e., no harmonic terms, purely elliptical isophotes (top), n ≤ 4 (middle), n ≤ 6, n ≤ 8 and our preferred model, n ≤ 10
(bottom). The black curve is the same in all ﬁve panels, and represents the pixel distribution corresponding to the residual image from
the highest-quality model (i.e., the bottom panel), which corresponds to the reconstruction in Figure 5 and is adopted troughout our

level of sophistication to the use of n ≤ 4, i.e., the standard
boxyness/discyness terms, does little to nothing to improve
the ﬁt. The dispersion is just as broad, still bi-modal, and
the X-shape just as pronounced (Figure 6, middle panels).
This clearly shows that, for edge-on galaxies, the X/P fea-
ture cannot be quantiﬁed with the B4 harmonic term. It
is only when the sixth harmonic is included that the pixel
distribution suddenly approaches a Gaussian shape, with a
dispersion 2.3 times narrower than the n ≤ 4 case (2.5 times
narrower than for the pure ellipse model), and the X-shaped
feature is adequately captured. The pixel distribution re-
sulting from our highest-quality model (corresponding to

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

n ≤ 10) is overplotted in black in all panels of Figure 6.
In passing, we note how Isofit/Cmodel enable the easy vi-
sual identiﬁcationof a background spiral galaxy in the image
of NGC 128.

The role played by B6 is even more apparent when we
plot the radial proﬁles of the harmonic coeﬃcients. We show
the even-n cosine coeﬃcients output by Isofit in Figure 7,
for the range of harmonic orders 4 (cid:54) n (cid:54) 10.

In Figure 7, B4 (which models boxyness/discyness, as
usual) contributes signiﬁcanly to the isophote shape. The B4
proﬁle indicates a transition from discy (B4 > 0) to boxy
(B4 < 0) to discy again with increasing Rmaj. However, it

Figure 8. Extended B6 proﬁle of NGC 128, derived from the
SDSS r−band image (Figure 3).

Curiously, a faint 8-prong pattern is evident in the cen-
tral ∼ 6(cid:48)(cid:48) of the residual image, when employing the n ≤ 6
model (Figure 6, third panel down). As the n = 6 harmonic
describes the X/P shape, the n = 8 term then captures this
fainter 8-spoked feature (see Figure 7, third panel down).
One can speculate that the latter pattern may reﬂect that
in the central ∼ 6(cid:48)(cid:48), the spheroid component contributes
to the isophote shapes along the minor-axis, and thus the
spheroid, disc an peanut together induce a total of eight
‘bumps’ in the shapes of the inner isophotes: two from the
disc (along the major-axis), two from the bulge (along the
minor-axis) and four from the peanut’s X-like ‘arms’. This
pattern might also be caused by the fact that the two nested
X shapes are slightly oﬀset from each other, i.e. they do not
necessarily have the same point of origin and certainly do
not have the same opening angle ψ of the X ‘arm’ relative to
the major-axis (see Table 2). This oﬀset may therefore cause
these low-level, leftover systematics, which are corrected by
the higher order harmonics.

The ﬁve X/P diagnostics of NGC 128 were computed
from both the HST - and SDSS- derived B6 proﬁles (Figures
7 and 8). This was necessary because, due to the small ﬁeld
of view of the HST image, the integrated strength of the
main (outer) peanut could not be measured reliably (R2
from Equation 7 corresponds to an isophote semi-major axis
of ∼ 38(cid:48)(cid:48), outside of the N IC3 CCD). It also provided a
consistency check for Πmax, RΠ ,max and zΠ ,max from two
diﬀerent images of the same galaxy. In addition to the main
outer peanut, we also measured the ﬁve quantities for the
inner peanut. The results are tabulated in Tables 2 and 3.

Figurs 4 and 7 nicely show how the two X/P struc-
tures of NGC 128 are associated with its two bars. This is
indicated through the major-axis radii of the isophotes cor-
responding to the two peanuts of this galaxy, namely Rmaj,a
for the inner peanut and Rmaj,b for the outer. We draw the
reader’s attention to the fact that, for a given isophote, the
projected peanut radius RΠ is diﬀerent to the isophote’s
major-axis radius Rmaj, the latter being always longer than
the former (see Figure 1). In Figures 4 and 9 we follow the
standard practice of plotting the surface brightness proﬁle
as a function of isophote semi-major axis, i.e., Rmaj. For
consistency, we indicate in these two plots the Rmaj of the
isophotes having the maximum B6 value, corresponding to
the two peanuts. These two radii clearly correspond visually
to approximately the ends of the inner and outer bars (i.e.,
the radii where the bar proﬁles cease to be ﬂat and start
to drop oﬀ in surface brightness), respectively, though we

coeﬃcients (Bn) of order 4 ≤ n ≤ 10, plotted as a function of
isophote semi-major axis. B4 represents boxyness/discyness while
B6 captures the peanut shape and dominates in amplitude over
the other harmonic orders at Rmaj ∼ 10 − 25 arcsec (see also
Figure 8), where the X/P feature is most prominent. The higher
orders have comparatively low amplitudes, and serve to reﬁne the
ﬁnal isophote shape through small peturbations to the elliptical
shape. Data extracted from the N IC3 image (Figure 5).

is not this harmonic which captures the X/P feature, but in
fact the B6 harmonic (Figure 6). It is clear that B6 domi-
nates over all other coeﬃcients at Rmaj (cid:38) 20(cid:48)(cid:48). This is in fact
the locus where the peanut is most prominent, as we show in
Figure 5 through the outer thick contour (which corresponds
to Πmax) overlayed on the data and the reconstructed im-
age. As Rmaj decreases, so does the B6 amplitude, mirroring
the isophotes becoming more elliptical (slightly boxy) and
the peanut shape less and less apparent. The higher-order
harmonics are comparatively low-level, and most likely only
serve to reﬁne the ﬁnal isophote shape, as we shall discuss
below.
It is worth noting that at Rmaj ∼ 5(cid:48)(cid:48) there is another
peak in the B6 proﬁle. While this is a radius where the
isophote has contributions from other harmonic orders, it is
likely that there is in fact a second, nested X/P structure in
these inner regions. The use of Isofit, therefore, is essential
in identifying and measuring very faint X/P structures that
would otherwise not be detected.

4.2 The Full Galaxy Sample

Having now detailed the analysis and quantiﬁcation of X/P
structures in our case-study of NGC 128, we now present
the remaining galaxies. While NGC 128 hosts a remark-
ably strong and obvious peanut structure, this is not nec-
essarily the case for all such galaxies (moreover, its inner
peanut was hidden under the luminosity of the bulge and
disc). Peanut bulges come in a wide range of shapes and
sizes: some puﬃng up strongly outside the disc plane and
showing a clear X-shape (e.g., NGC 3628, ESO 443-042),
others (e.g., NGC 2654, NGC 2683) displaying so-called
spurs (Erwin & Debattista 2013), some barely perturbing
the discy/lenticular shape of their host (e.g. NGC 2549 (b))
while others showing peanut-like isophotes ‘pinched’ along
the minor axis (e.g., NGC 128, NGC 4469). Nevertheless,
our method of isophotal analysis proved robust for all of
these cases, as the peanut invariably left its imprint on the
radial B6 proﬁles of these galaxies.

The results of the isophotal analysis (image, reconstruc-
tion, residual and B6 proﬁle) for each individual galaxy are
shown in Appendix A (Figure A1), while we report the
peanut diagnostics in Table 2. Before proceeding, provide
some additional remarks concerning some of the galaxies in
our sample.

(i) NGC 2549 – This is the second galaxy where we detect
both an inner and an outer X/P structure. As for NGC 128,
we denote the inner peanut with (a) and the outer with (b).
Also similarly to NGC 128, we measured the diagnostics for
(a) from an HST image, this time taken with the Wide
Field (WF) + Planetary Camera (PC), WFPC 2. We refer
the reader to Fig. 8 in C15 to see the image, reconstruc-
tion and residual, and their Fig. 10 to see the B6 proﬁle.
However, because the peak in the outer peanut coincided
spatially with the gap between the WF and PC chips, we
again opted to model peanut (b) using the SDSS r–band
image. We show the latter in Figure A1 with an increased
number of contours overplotted, to aid the eye in making
out the inner peanut. Although we also see the signature
of peanut (a) in the SDSS B6 proﬁle, we prefer the higher
spatial resolution (and lower seeing) of the HST image for
measuring it, since poorer seeing smears out and systemat-
ically underestimates the X/P peak (we see this in Table
2, where the B6 proﬁle of NGC 128 has lower amplitude for
both peanuts in the SDSS data compared to the HST data).
Again, we indicate the major-axis radii of peanuts (a) and
(b) on the surface brightness proﬁle decomposition (Figure
9), and again we see that both radii match approximately
the ends of the two bars: ∼ 10(cid:48)(cid:48) for bar (a) (in good agree-
ment with the range 8 − 10(cid:48)(cid:48) reported in Laurikainen et al.
2011) and ∼ 30(cid:48)(cid:48) for bar (b).

(ii) NGC 2654 and NGC 2683 – Both of these galaxies
display regions of comparatively low brightness, bordered
by ‘spurs’, along the major axis on either side of the ‘bulge’,
suggesting that they are boxy/peanut (Erwin & Debattista

an exponential (disc) component, the proﬁle also shows the sig-
natures of two bars, modelled with S´ersic functions of low n
(∼ 0.1 − 0.2), and plotted as the cyan curves. As in Figure 4, the

soula et al. 2015) viewed close to, but not exactly, edge-on,
with a thin bar aligned such that its viewing angle α < 90◦
(i.e., not exactly side-on).
(iii) NGC 4111 – This galaxy appears to host an inner
peanut as well, at ∼ 2(cid:48)(cid:48), in the SDSS i–band image. How-
ever, a closer inspection reveals an edge-on dust torus per-
pendicular to the disc plane at precisely this spatial scale.
The obscuration which this induces causes the isophotes to
appear ‘pinched’, just as they would if an inner peanut were
there. Therefore, we chose to not classify this as an inner
peanut, at least not until higher-resolution NIR imaging is
available (NB: The ‘inner peanut’ does not show at all in the
B6 proﬁle extracted from the Spitzer imaging, both 3.6µ
and 4.5µ).

(iv) NGC 4469 – The major axis of this galaxy is heav-
ily obscured by dust. As there is no NIR image available,
we used the reddest SDSS passband (z) image, which has
relatively poor S/N, and still shows the dust slightly, in the
inner regions (see residual map). Nevertheless, the B6 pro-
ﬁle, though noisy, is robust and very nicely shows the peanut
signature.

(v) NGC 4710 – The image of this galaxy (and, much
more obviously, the residual image) shows two pronounced
stripes, which were attributed to dark stripes on the CCDs
caused by a bright star (there are two because the image is
a mosaic of diﬀerent individual exposures).

For each galaxy in the sample, we extracted the major-
axis surface brightness proﬁle, µ(Rmaj), and decomposed it

with profiler to obtain the disc scale length. As we have
discussed above, X/P structures are closely associated with
the galactic discs in which they are embedded. If a disc buck-
les and gives rise to a bar, which also buckles and gives rise
to a peanut, the peanut may reﬂect the disc’s fundamen-
tal properties. A pertinent question, therefore, is: are the
peanut’s metrics (size, shape) random, or do they depend
on their host disc’s properties? We address this question
by measuring the disc’s scale length h, and expressing the
peanut height, projected length, peak width and integrated
strength in units of h, as well in kiloparsecs. Because our
test-case galaxy, NGC 128, displays very unusual (warped)
morphology, and the surface brightness proﬁle of its disc is
not exponential, but S´ersic (n ∼ 0.4; see Figure 4), it is
not meaningful to assign it a scale length. As such, we only
report values of h for the rest of the galaxies in our sample.

The PSF proﬁles used to convolve the model µ(Rmaj)

were always characterised from bright stars in the image of
each galaxy. A second example of a profiler decomposition
is shown for NGC 2549 in the top panel of Figure 9, where
the model consisted of a bulge (S´ersic function, red curve), a
disc (exponential, blue curve) and a bar associated with each
of the two peanuts (Ferrers functions – Ferrers 1877, cyan
curves), once again nicely conﬁrming the bar-peanut connec-
tion in this second galaxy with a nested peanut structure.

4.3 Scaling Relations

The data shows a remarkably tight correlation between
RΠ ,max and the integrated peanut strength SΠ (i.e., the
area under the B6 curve). We display this relationship in
the upper panels of Figure 10. As B6 is dimensionless, with
any radial dependence normalised out through Equation 3,
it is independent of RΠ ,max, and therefore so is SΠ , which is

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

derived from the proﬁle. This relation implies that stronger
peanuts are located further out in a galaxy, and it is further
surprising that, while reasonably tight in units of kpc, it also
holds when expressing both quantities in units of the disc
scale length h (Figure 10, top-left panel). This suggests that
when a disc deﬁned by a scale length h buckles and forms
a bar, which in turn gives rise to a peanut, the resulting
peanut still retains the information about its parent disc’s
scale length. This is consistent with the scenario proposed
by Bureau et al. (2006), who suggest that the diﬀerent com-
ponents of galaxies with X/P features (including the peanut
component itself) are dynamically coupled, and most likely
all originated from the disc material.

We performed basic linear ﬁts to all the trends plotted
in Figure 10, which we show as Equations 8, 9, 10 and 11. As
NGC 128 (b) appears to be an outlier from all the trends, we
excluded it from the ﬁts. The fact that this galaxy is an out-
lier is not entirely surprising considering its peculiarity. More
speciﬁcally, in addition to its visibly distorted morphology,
there is also evidence that it hosts a counter-rotating gas
disc, tilted at ∼ 26◦ from its major axis (Emsellem & Arse-
nault 1997). Perhaps NGC 128 is an example of the scenario
proposed by Binney & Petrou (1985), who argue that galaxy
interactions (slow accretion: galactic cannibalism) may if not
generate, then at least enhance the peanut shape. NGC 128
is just such a galaxy, and we deliberately show its compan-
ion NGC 127 in Figure 3, which visibly exchanges material
with it. In fact, several of our galaxies display somewhat
distorted (S-shaped) disc planes, possibly indicating insta-
bility due to tidal interaction (e.g., NGC 7332). Note that
we expect non-symmetric harmonics (both An and Bn coef-
ﬁcients) in galaxies observed in the process of bar-buckling.
For such cases, the dominant shape of the instability would
be a strong banana shape, which would likely be described
by, e.g., n = 3 or, if the disc is comparatively bright at those
radial scales, by n = 5 (in edge-on disc projection, side-on
bar projection).

All the linear regressions were performed with the bi-
sector method. The ﬁt uncertainties were computed through
bootstrap re-sampling (10 000 samples), which is best suited
for such sparse data.

That the peanut strength correlates with both its height
and its length is not surprising given that the latter two
appear to be correlated to each other. As shown in Figure
11, the shorter (RΠ ,max (cid:46) 2.5 kpc) X/P structures follow
a characteristic height-to-length ratio of ∼ 0.5 - 0.6, which
breaks down for the longer X/P structures. While the bar

ratio of zΠ ,max/RΠ ,max of ∼ 0.5 − 0.6, while the larger peanuts
appear to deviate from this. As in Figure 10, the green symbols

orientation (the sin(α) term mentioned prior to Equation 4)
may impact this trend, driving down the observed projected
length if not viewed perfectly side-on, the discrepancies can
be perhaps also understood from the point of view of the
peanut’s age or additional, non-secular processes, as we will
speculate in Section 5.

In terms of the peanut height above the disc (zΠ ,max),
we found that for all galaxies in our sample this lies in the
range 0.1h ≤ zΠ ≤ 0.5h, or equivalently, within ∼ 2.6 kpc.
The stronger peanuts also seem to reach greater heights
above the disc plane, though this trend is not as tight as
the location–strength relation.

4.3.1 Peanut–Disc Scaling Relations

Just as ‘bar strength’ has been tested for correlations with
properties of the host disc, such as star formation (e.g., Mar-
tinet & Friedli 1997; Aguerri 1999), nuclear activity (e.g.,
Laurikainen, Salo & Rautiainen 2002; Laurikainen, Salo &
Buta 2004; Cisternas et al. 2013), central velocity dispersion
(Das et al. 2008), various gaseous features (e.g., Peeples &
Martini 2006; Kim, Seo & Kim 2012; see also Athanassoula,
Machado & Rodionov 2013), etc., we can now test for cor-
relations between peanut strength and the physical charac-
teristics of the host disc. It is hoped that this will provide
a further quantitative setting for testing the diﬀerent mech-
anisms proposed for peanut formation, and thus a deeper
understanding of their evolutionary path.

We observed a positive, though weak, correlation of the
galaxy’s vrot/σ(cid:63) (Figure 12). This trend shows, in essence,
that peanuts are more pronounced in faster rotating galax-
ies, once more pointing towards their link with the host disc.
As before, we performed linear (bisector method) ﬁts to the
relations in Figure 12, and estimated the uncertainties via
bootstrap re-sampling. We show the relations as Equations
12 and 13. We note, however, the exclusion of 5 data points

5 DISCUSSION

Having diagnosed and quantiﬁed the X/P features in our
galaxy sample, we now shift the focus of the paper to dis-
cussing the information encoded in our peanut diagnostics.
Most studies in the literature invoke either the buckling
of bars (Raha et al. 1991) or vertical Lindblad Resonances
(Combes et al. 1990) to describe essentially the same class
of objects. While numerical simulations have been resound-
ingly successful at reproducing, visually, X/P-like struc-
tures, direct comparisons between observations and simu-

lations have seldom been performed. As such, it remains an
open question which physical mechanism is responsible for
which type of X/P structure. Our study aims, among other
things, to provide a set of useful measurements from real
X/P galaxies which can act as constraints for N -body sim-
ulations of galactic dynamics (e.g., Saha & Gerhard 2013).
The ﬁrst point to note is that our sample galaxies are
remarkably heterogeneous in terms of their radial B6 proﬁle
shape. While all show an unambiguous peak in B6, which is
the mark of the peanut, the peak can be shaped like a hump
(e.g., NGC 128a, NGC 2549a and b, NGC 4111), hump-on-
plateau (NGC 128b, NGC 2654, NGC 4710, ESO 443-042),
top-hat (NGC 3628), saw-tooth (steady rise followed by sharp
decline; NGC 2683, NGC 4469) or even pyramid (NGC 678).
This is not very surprising since bars (and triaxial ellip-
soids in general) can host a large variety of orbit families
(Patsis, Skokos & Athanassoula 2002, Patsis & Katsanikas
2014a, Patsis & Katsanikas 2014b, Valluri et al. 2015), each
of which potentially leaving its characteristic imprint on the
photometric morphology of the host galaxy.

If a bar buckles, it forms a peanut in the inner re-
gions (Raha et al. 1991, Athanassoula & Martinez-Valpuesta
2009), and one would expect a relatively ﬂat B6 proﬁle
(e.g., top-hat) along the entire peanut length. On the other
hand, a resonance mechanism usually occurs in a narrow ra-
dial range, thus corresponding to a comparatively sharper
peanut peak (e.g., hump or pyramid). It would be interesting
to see from simulations i) whether there is a characteristic
B6 shape for each of the two phenomenologies and ii) how
the shape evolves with time.

We might be observing peanuts at diﬀerent stages of

their lifetime, i.e., newly-formed or old. As these features
have been shown to drift outwards with time (Quillen et al.
2014), the radial
length RΠ ,max, coupled with the peak
width, WΠ , of the B6 proﬁle, might be an indicator of
their age. The latter point is supported by noticing that
for the two galaxies which host nested peanuts (NGC 128
and NGC 2549), the inner peanut (which is presumably the
younger) has a narrower span than the outer, presumably
older X/P structure. For this work, however, we are lim-
ited by projection eﬀects and can only measure the pro-
jected peanut length, RΠ ,max = lΠ ,max sin(α). This aspect
is a strong restriction to any conclusions we may draw from
Figures 10 to 12. For now we speculate that we may see ten-
tative evidence of radial drift (starting from the ‘character-
istic ratio’ and moving out in radius while keeping the same
height) or length/height enhancements due to external, non-
secular processes, such as tidal interactions), though we re-
quire additional information on the bar’s orientation in the
disc plane to draw any conclusions. The key to constraining
α may lie in applying our method to edge-on (disc) pro-
jections of simulated galaxies viewed at diﬀerent bar angles
α, ranging from side-on to end-on. The B6 proﬁles, which
may contain information about α, could easily be recov-
ered from isodensity contours of the simulation projections

c(cid:13) 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000

(rather than isophotes). Such a study excedes the scope of
this paper, however, and we defer it for future works.

6 CONCLUSIONS

In this work we deﬁne ﬁve quantitative diagnostics of X/P
structures in edge-on galaxies, based of the sixth Fourier
mode (B6) of their isophotes: i) the peak amplitude of the B6
radial proﬁle, Πmax, ii) its projected length along the major-
axis, RΠ ,max, iii) its height above the disc plane, zΠ ,max, iv)
the integrated strength, SΠ (Equation 7) and v) the width
of the B6 peak, WΠ . Additionally, we introduce a qualitative
classiﬁcation of X/P galaxies, based on the shape of the B6
proﬁle.

We demonstrate our methodology on NGC 128, a
galaxy with a very strong peanut, and extend our analy-
sis to a sample of eleven other galaxies known to host such
structures. This technique is accurate, easy to implemented
and automate, and it performs best when using imaging with
low dust obscuration (dust-free galaxies or NIR wavelegths).

Our main ﬁndings can be summarised as follows:

• The n = 4 Fourier harmonic of isophotes (B4) does
not describe the X/peanut–shaped structure. Out of all the

Fourier harmonics tested (0 ≤ n ≤ 10), it is the n = 6 order
(B6 term) which captures the peanut.
• We detect, for the ﬁrst time, nested peanuts (one inner
and one outer) in two of the eleven galaxies of our sample,
namely NGC 128 and NGC 2549.
• The galaxies in our sample are quite heterogeneous in
terms of their B6 proﬁle shapes (which range from hump-
shaped, hump-on-plateau, top-hat, saw-tooth and pyra-
mid, in our classiﬁcation scheme). We speculate that these
may provide insight into disentangling between the various
peanut formation scenarios in the literature.
• We identiﬁed trends between peanut projected length
and strength, and between peanut height and strength. The
stronger peanuts are located at larger radii and reach greater
heights above the disc plane. These trends hold when ex-
pressed in units of kpc and disc scale length, indicating that
peanuts ‘know’ about the disc in which they live. Together
with an apparently characteristic height-to-length ratio for
small peanuts, this constitutes valuable constraints for sim-
ulations.
• We additionally identiﬁed a positive, though weak, cor-
relation between peanut parameters (length and strength)
and the galaxy’s vrot/σ(cid:63), such that faster-rotating galaxies
tend to host larger and more pronounced X/P structures.
This provides yet more support for the peanut–host disc
link, but would beneﬁt from more data.

There are many catalogues of edge-on disc galaxies (e.g.,
Dalcanton & Bernstein 2002; Kregel, van der Kruit & Free-
man 2005; Kautsch et al. 2006; Yoachim & Dalcanton 2006;
Comer´on et al. 2011; Bizyaev et al. 2014) including even
the late-type ultra-ﬂat galaxies (Karachentseva et al. 2016)
that can now be quantitatively analysed for the presence of
X-shaped features. Isofit is also well placed to both search
for and quantify, in addition to cataloguing, banana-shaped
(in projection) bars in the act of buckling in real galaxies,
through non-symmetric harmonic terms.

Additionally, kinematic follow-up of nested peanuts
may be insightful, and several integral ﬁeld spectrographs
such as the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA;
S´anchez et al. 2012); the Sydney-AAO Multi-object Integral
ﬁeld spectrograph (SAMI; Croom et al. 2012), the Mapping
Nearby Galaxies survey (MaNGA; Bundy et al. 2015), or
the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE; Bacon et al.
2010) are ideal for this task (see for example Gonzalez et al.
2016, who study the X/P galaxy NGC 4710 with the MUSE
instrument).

Furthermore, this method allows for direct comparisons
between real, observed galaxies and simulations. Used in
conjunction, an observational approach, coupled with N -
body simulations, have the potential to disentangle the var-
ious X/P formation mechanisms proposed in the literature.
Such studies, however, are beyond the scope of this pa-
per and, along with a study of the Milky Way’s own peanut–
shaped bulge, we defer them for future works.

APPENDIX A: MODELLING THE GALAXIES

In this section we show the results of our Isofit/Cmodel
analysis for each of the galaxies in our sample. Speciﬁcally,
in each panel of Figure A1, we show the galaxy image and its
orientation, the image reconstruction made with Cmodel,

16

Ciambur & Graham

the residual image obtained by subtracting the reconstruc-
tion from the original image and, at the bottom, the B6 pro-
ﬁle as a function of peanut radius (see Figure 1). The image
and its reconstruction both have their respective isophote
contours overlayed (at identical levels), and the thicker con-
tour corresponds to the maximum B6 amplitude (Πmax).

Figure A1. Each quadrant, from top to bottom panel: image, model, residual and B6 proﬁle. Thick contours corespond to Πmax (the
isophote with maximal B6 amplitude).
