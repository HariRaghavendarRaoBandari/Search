The period ratio P1/P2 of torsional Alfv´en waves with
steady ﬂows in spicules

H. Ebadi • S. Shahmorad • S. Vasheghani Farahani

Abstract The aim here is to model the standing tor-
sional oscillations in solar spicules in the presence of
density stratiﬁcation, magnetic ﬁeld expansion, and
steady ﬂows. By implementing cylindrical geometry,
the eigenfrequencies, eigenfunctions, and the period ra-
tio P1/P2 of these waves is obtained for ﬁnite plasma-
β. The shifts created by the steady ﬂow justiﬁes the
divergence of the observed period ratio for the ﬁrst and
second periods from the number 2.

1 Introduction

loops, arcades, ﬁlaments,

The solar atmosphere is designed by beautiful mag-
netic structures e.g.,
jets,
spicules, etc. The evolution in the observational in-
struments and satellites has made the observation
of these magnetic structures more and more possi-
ble over the years (Golub et al. 2007; Pesnell et al.
2012). But the concept that is of our interest is the
oscillations guided by these magnetic structures. Due
to the transverse structuring in the solar atmosphere

caused by these plasma eruptions, magnetohydrody-
namic (MHD) waves are bound to propagate along
them (Van Doorsselaere et al. 2008).
In the present
study the magnetic structures under consideration are
the spicules. Spicules are one of the most observed
phenomena in the solar atmosphere especially in the
chromosphere. Although spicules look very similar
to coronal jets, but they are usually smaller, cooler,
and denser. The chromospheric spicules observed at
the solar limb are reported to have speeds around
1 propagating out towards the solar
20 − 25 km s−
corona (Zaqarashvili and Erd´elyi 2009). The diame-
ter of spicules ranges from 400 km to 1500 km, and
their lengths ranges from 5000 km to 9000 km. The
typical lifetime of spicules is between 5 and 15 minutes,
with densities between 3.5 × 1016 and 2 × 1017 m−
3.
Their temperatures are estimated between 5000 and
8000 K (Beckers 1968; Sterling 2000). In the context
of the present study, it is the wave dynamics in spicules
which is to be taken under consideration. Spicules ex-
perience transverse oscillations which have already been
observed by both, spectroscopic and imaging devices.
Ground based coronagraphs (Nikolsky and Sazanov
1967; Kukhianidze et al. 2006; Zaqarashvili et al. 2007)
together with SOHO proved adequate for the detec-
tion of Doppler shift oscillations in spicules (Xia et al.
2005). With the enhancement of observational devices
(Hinode/SOT) periodic displacements of the spicule
axis became more and more pronounced, where some
where interpreted as kink (Kim et al. 2008; He et al.
2009; Ebadi and Ghiassi 2014; Ebadi et al. 2012; Ebadi
2013) and some as Alfv´enic waves (De Pontieu et al.
2007; Ebadi and Khoshrang 2014). However, the sta-
tistical study carried out by Okamoto and De Pontieu
(2011) using Hinode/SOT showed that 59% percent of
the waves guided by spicules propagate upward, 21% of
the waves propagate downward, and 20% of the waves
In the present study the
are standing oscillations.

MHD wave under consideration is the torsional Alfv´en
wave. Out of all the MHD waves (Edwin and Roberts
1983), only the torsional Alfv´en wave is completely in-
compressible (Van Doorsselaere et al. 2008). However
Vasheghani et al. (2010) showed that in the presence
of an equilibrium magnetic twist, the torsional wave
becomes compressible. Observation wise, there is still
vague indirect evidence of the detection of torsional
Alfv´en waves in the solar chromosphere and corona.
This is due to lack of spatial resolution in solar observa-
tions. However, Zaqarashvili (2003); Zaqarashvili et al.
(2007) studied the non-thermal broadening of the green
line in a coronal loop and came to the conclusion that
they are standing torsional waves. In the photosphere-
chromosphere region, Jess et al. (2009) reported the
periodic variations of the spectral line widths as detec-
tion of torsional waves.
One of the features of coronal seismology is the pe-
riod ratio, P1/P2, of the waves, where P1 represents
its fundamental period and P2 represents its ﬁrst har-
monic. In this line Ebadi and Khoshrang (2014) ana-
lyzed the time series of oxygen line proﬁles obtained
from SUMER/SOHO on the solar south limb spicules.
They calculated the Doppler shifts and consequently
Doppler velocities in the coronal hole region. Their
wavelet analysis determined periods of the fundamen-
tal mode and ﬁrst harmonic. The calculated period
ratios showed departures from the canonical value of 2.
The reason for this deviation could be due to two is-
sues. One is density stratiﬁcation (Andries et al. 2009),
the other is magnetic twist (Karami and Bahari 2009,
2012). In other words, Van Doorsselaere et al. (2007)
analyzed active region observations based on TRACE
instrument and detected two periods with high con-
ﬁdence and calculated P1/P2 as 1.8. Nonetheless,
Ebadi and Shahmorad (2014) studied the competitive
eﬀects of density stratiﬁcation and magnetic ﬁeld ex-
pansion on torsional Alfv´en waves in solar spicules.
They showed that under some circumstances this ra-
tio can approach its observational value even though it
departs from its canonical value of 2.

In the present study, in addition to the density strat-
iﬁcation and magnetic ﬁeld expansion of the cylin-
drical structure which resembles a solar spicule, a
steady ﬂow parallel to the vertical magnetic ﬁeld is
also taken in to account. Prior to this work the eﬀects
of steady ﬂows where studied in cylindrical structures
by Goossens et al. (1992); Terra-Homem and Erd´elyi
(2003); Vasheghani et al. (2009) where it was shown
how the steady ﬂow makes the frequencies undergo a
Doppler shift as well as shifting the cut-oﬀ frequencies.
The consequence of this could be reﬂected in the pe-
riod ratios of the oscillations in the wave guiding struc-
ture Ruderman (2010). Ebadi et al. (2012) analyzed

the observational data obtained from Hinode/SOT and
performed time slice diagrams shedding more light on
the spicule oscillations. In the present study the MHD
waves in the presence of steady ﬂow inside solar spicule
is studied. The model is discussed in the next section.

2 Model and equilibrium conditions

Consider an expanding untwisted magnetic ﬂux tube
with varying density along its axis.
If a steady ﬂow
along the axis of this tube is present, a solar spicule
is resembled.
It is now clear that the geometry im-
plemented will be cylindrical with coordinates (r, ϕ, z).
Note that the cylinder axis is aligned with the z-axis
and the equilibrium magnetic ﬁeld components are Br
and Bz with no azimuthal ﬁeld, (Bϕ = 0). The equi-
librium magnetic ﬁeld, B, could be written in terms of
the vector potential (A) as

A =

ψ(r, z)

where we have

Br = −

(2)

Note that ψ is taken constant along the ﬁeld lines.
Since the aim here is to study standing torsional Alfv´en
waves, we consider one node on the foot point of the
spicule at z = 0 and the other node on the extent of
the spicule at z = L. Note that L is the spicule length.
The dynamics of such oscillations are well described by
the model proposed by Ruderman (2011). If the steady
ﬂow inside the spicule is parallel to the spicule axis and
represented by v0, we have

where the plasma displacement is ξ = (0, ξϕ, 0), and the
magnetic ﬁeld perturbation is b = (0, bϕ, 0). By con-
sidering the perturbations proportional to exp(−iωt),
Eqs. (3) and (4) would become

In the long-wavelength limit where, R, the radius of ex-
panding spicule is much smaller than the spicule length

3 Numerical results and Discussions

Now by diﬀerentiating the identities ψ = ψ(r(ψ, z), z)
and r = r(ψ(r, z), z) with respect to z, and making use

The numerical study carried out here is based on
the diﬀerential transform method (DTM (Erturk et al.
2012; Nazari and Shahmorad 2010)). This method is
applied to Equation (11) which gives the eigenfrequen-
cies and eigenfunctions of standing torsional Alfv´en
waves in stratiﬁed and expanding solar spicules, see
Ebadi and Shahmorad (2014) for detailed description
of this method.

see Ruderman et al. (2008); Verth et al. (2010); Karami and Bahari
(2011) for details. Equation (7) is a generalization of
the analysis presented by Morton et al. (2011).

In the context of coronal seismology, it would be
more realistic to use the background magnetic ﬁeld,
plasma density, and spicule radius inferred from the
actual magnetoseismology of observation (Verth et al.
2011)

Bz(z) = B0 exp(−z/HB)
ρ(z) = ρ0 exp(−z/Hρ)
R(z) = R0 exp(z/2HB).

(10)

The third expressio of Equation 10 is due to the conser-
vation of the magnetic ﬂux, where HB and Hρ are the
magnetic and density scale heights, respectively. sub-
stituting Eqs. (10) in Equation (7) gives

We use the rigid boundary conditions and assume
that ξϕ(0) = ξϕ(L) = 0. In the top panel of Figure 1
the fundamental frequency (n = 1) of the torsional
Alfv´en wave is plotted with respect to the parameter
α for various Mach numbers. This has been repeated
for the second harmonic and shown in the middle panel
of Figure 1. It could be readily noticed by comparing
the corresponding curves of the top and middle panels
of Figure 1 that their ratios are away from number 2.
Now to give an exact ﬂavor, the period ratios of the
ﬁrst and second harmonics, P1/P2, are plotted in the
bottom panel of Figure 1.

As it is expected, the frequencies are shifted not only
because of the ﬂow, but also because of stratiﬁcation
and tube expansion (Ebadi et al. 2012). In other words,
their variations respect to α are very moderate. Both
the eﬀects of stratiﬁcation as well as the tube expan-
sion are quite strong. However they act in the opposite
directions. While the stratiﬁcation results in the re-
duction of the ratio P1/P2, the tube expansion leads to
the increase of this ratio. As a result, the two eﬀects
almost cancel each other. We can observe that they
exactly cancel each other when HB = 2Hρ.

frequency for Mach numbers equal to MA = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4
plotted against the parameter α. Middle panel, the second
harmonic frequency plotted against the parameter α . The
bottom panel, the period ratio P1/P2 of the fundamental P1
and second harmonic period P2 of the torsional wave against
the parameter α. Note that the colors black, blue, red, and
green correspond to MA = 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, respectively.

It could be noticed that slower steady ﬂows create
higher frequencies and consequently lower periods with
respect to those of static medium. An interesting result
which is obtained by looking at the bottom panel of
Figure 1 is that the period ratio, P1/P2, is very close
to the observed values. This is due to the consideration
of the steady ﬂows in the analysis. As a matter of fact,
in the case of Mach numbers equal to 0.2 and 0.3 the
results are in very good agreement with observational
results. It should be emphasized that steady ﬂows have
already been reported in observations carried out on
spicules.

Eigenfunctions of the fundamental and ﬁrst har-
monic torsional Alfv´en modes with respect to the nor-
malized height along the spicule are presented in Fig-
ure 2. We plotted eigenfunctions for HB = 0.1135,
Hρ = 0.094, and MA = 0.25 which is determined by
observations.

4 Conclusion

In the context of coronal seismology the aim is to un-
derstand the aspects of a phenomenon taking place in
the corona by means of waves. The phenomenon under
consideration in this study is the solar spicules and the
wave for studying it is the torsional Alfv´en wave. The
models that we implemented to study the spicule is an
expanding untwisted magnetic ﬂux tube with varying
density along its axis with a steady ﬂow. The coordi-
nates implemented for modeling the spicule was cylin-
drical (r, ϕ, z).

By implementing cylindrical geometry, the eigenfre-
quencies, eigenfunctions, and the period ratio P1/P2
of standing torsional waves was obtained based on the
observational data provided by Verth et al. (2011) for
ﬁnite plasma-β. The shifts created by the steady ﬂow
justiﬁes the divergence of the observed period ratio for
the ﬁrst and second periods from the number 2. By
plugging in the model, actual observed data of the back-
ground magnetic ﬁeld, plasma density, and spicule ra-
dius; the eigenfrequencies, eigenfunctions, and the pe-
riod ratio P1/P2 of standing torsional waves were esti-
mated. An interesting result obtained is that the period
ratio, P1/P2, is very close to the observed values. This
is because of taking in to account the eﬀects of steady
ﬂows in the analysis. As a matter of fact, in the case
of Mach numbers equal to 0.2 and 0.3 the results get
very close to observations. The interplay of stratiﬁca-
tion and equilibrium steady ﬂow proved that the steady
ﬂow is something not to neglect. The good agreement
of the numerical results obtained in this study with ob-
servations proof the eﬃciency of the steady ﬂow eﬀects
compared to stratiﬁcation.
