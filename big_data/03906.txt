Abstract

Discovery of gravitational waves by LIGO team [1] bring a new era for observation of black
hole systems. These new observations will improve our knowledge on black holes and gravitational
physics. In this study, we present angular momentum loss mechanism through gravitational radia-
tion for selected X-ray binary systems. The angular momentum loss in X-ray binary systems with
a black hole companion due to gravitational radiation and mass loss time-scales are estimated for
each selected system. In addition, their gravitational wave amplitudes are also estimated and their
detectability with gravitational wave detectors has been discussed.

Introduction

In astrophysics, binary stars provide an excelent laboratory to study stellar properties. Analysis
of a double-lined spectroscopic binary with an eclipsing light variation gives information about mass,
radius, luminosities and the distance of the system. Most of the stars whose masses and other physical
parameters are known, are member of binary systems. It has been discovered observationally Cyg X-1
to have a black hole companion, because of its binary property [2].

Massive stars at the end of their evolution following a core collapse/supernova, they leave behind
either a neutron star or a black hole. The processes may diﬀer in a single star and in a star that
is a member of a binary system. In binary systems the massive component evolve faster to form an
X-ray binary system. One of the component in an X-ray binary system is a black hole or a neutron
star. X-ray binaries can be divided into three subclasses according to the masses of the companion
stars: (i) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), (ii) intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB), (iii) high-
mass X-ray binary (HMXB). After discovery of gravitational wave event by LIGO team (Abbott et
al. 2006) signiﬁcance of compact binary systems is increased. Especially those close binary systems
with a black hole components, since they could be the progenitor of binary black hole systems and
therefore candidates for gravitational wave astronomy.
In this project, X-ray binary systems with
black hole components have been studied. Physical and orbital parameters of the binary systems have
been collected from the literature to study their long-term light variations and angular momentum
loss mechanisms.

2 Angular Momentum Loss Mechanisms in Binary Star Systems

Angular momentum loss mechanisms in a binary system depend on the systems type and its geometric
structure. For instance, in main sequence stars angular momentum loss via stellar wind is dominant
(see [3], [4], [10]) while in cataclysmic variables and in some other X-ray binaries both mass loss by
stellar activity and angular momentum via gravitational radiation is important (see [6], [5] and refer-
ences therein). If both stars are compact and the orbital period is short enough, gravitational radiation
is the main mechanism of angular momentum loss. One of the predictions of the general relativity is
the energy loss caused by perturbation in space-time of binary stars that releases gravitational waves
[7], [8], [9].

3 Angular Momentum Loss Mechanisms in Binary Systems with a

Black Hole Components

In this study, observational results of 27 binary systems with black hole components have been cata-
logued. Orbital period of these systems vary from 0.2 to 34 days while black hole masses vary from
4 to 23 solar masses. Most of the binary systems have circular orbits (e=0) while a few of them
have eccentric orbits. In X-ray binary systems, mass loss via both late type and early type stellar
activities are observed. This is even more important in systems where the separation of the compo-
nents decreases. Angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation present in addition to the angular
momentum loss via mass loss. Angular momentum loss time scale via stellar wind and gravitational
radiation are given by [4] as

Angular momentum loss rates and time scales of the selected systems are estimated by using

Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). The results are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.

Binary systems consisting of black hole components with short orbital periods are candidates for
gravitational-wave sources. GW observation is a tools for detecting double black hole binaries, which
is already observed by LIGO [1]. GW amplitude (h) of these systems are compared with the limit of
gravitational wave interferometers (e.g. LISA, LIGO, VIRGO). Starting from the linearized Einstein
ﬁeld equation one can calculate the GW amplitude (h) as is given in Eq. (3) [11]. In Eq. (3) f is the
frequency, D is the distance of source in Mpc, and M is the total mass in solar unit. The gravitational
wave amplitudes of the selected systems are shown in Fig. 3. In the ﬁgure we plotted selected binary
systems with black holes within the observation limit of LISA satellite.
