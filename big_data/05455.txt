The micromechanics of nonlinear plastic modes

Edan Lerner

Nonlinear plastic modes (NPMs) are collective displacements that are indicative of imminent
plastic instabilities in elastic solids. In this work we formulate the atomistic theory that describes
the reversible evolution of NPMs and their associated stiﬀnesses under external deformations. The
deformation-dynamics of NPMs is compared to those of the analogous observables derived from
atomistic linear elastic theory, namely destabilizing eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix and their
associated eigenvalues. The key result we present and explain is that the dynamics of NPMs and of
destabilizing eigenmodes under external deformations follow diﬀerent scaling laws with respect to
the proximity to imminent instabilities. In particular, destabilizing modes vary with a singular rate,
whereas NPMs’ exhibit no such singularity. As a result, NPMs converge much earlier than desta-
bilizing eigenmodes to their common ﬁnal form at plastic instabilities. This dynamical diﬀerence
between NPMs and linear destabilizing eigenmodes underlines the usefulness of NPMs for predicting
the locus and geometry of plastic instabilities, compared to their linear-elastic counterparts.

I.

INTRODUCTION

When a disordered elastic solid is subjected to ex-
ternal deformation, particle-scale plastic instabilities are
inevitably encountered [1], each accompanied by a re-
arrangement of a small set of particles conventionally
coined as a ‘shear transformation’, and some degree of
energy dissipation [2–4]. The occurrence rate, microme-
chanical consequences, and interactions between these
instabilities determine the macroscopic rate of plastic
deformation, which is a key rheological observable that
controls important material properties such as toughness
and elastic limit [5].

The micromechanical process that takes place as plas-
tic instabilities are triggered under athermal conditions
has been thoroughly studied in the framework of atom-
istic linear elasticity [6–8]. In this framework, plastic in-
stabilities are reﬂected by the continuous vanishing of the
lowest eigenvalue λp of the dynamical matrix M ≡ ∂2U
∂(cid:126)x∂(cid:126)x
(see Appendix for tensoric notation conventions) as the
imposed shear strain γ approaches an instability strain
γc. Here and in what follows, (cid:126)x denotes the multidimen-
sional coordinate vector of all particles’ positions, and
U ((cid:126)x) denotes the potential energy. In the potential en-
ergy landscape (PEL) picture, plastic instabilities are un-
derstood as the coalescence and mutual annihilation of
a local minimum and a nearby ﬁrst-order saddle point,
a process known as a saddle-node bifurcation, at some
critical instability strain γc. This implies that asymptot-
ically close to the instability strain, i.e. as γ → γc, the
depends on the strain as λp ∼ √
eigenvalue associated with the destabilizing eigenmode
γc − γ. In Fig. 1 key mi-
cro and macroscopic aspects of the mechanics of plastic
instabilities are reviewed.

Plastic instabilities are cleanly captured by destabiliz-
ing eigenmodes only very close (in strain) to instability
strains, and more so as larger systems are considered, due
to hybridization processes of destabilizing eigenmodes
with low-energy plane waves. This is not the case, how-

ever, with nonlinear plastic modes (NPMs), introduced
ﬁrst in [9]. NPMs are collective displacement directions
which are indicative of the spatial structure and geometry
of imminent plastic instabilities. Their deﬁnition, which
is solely based on inherent structure information, hinges
on properly accounting for the relevant anharmonicities
of the potential energy landscape, as shown in [9] and ex-
plained in what follows. In this work we show that NPMs
closely resemble plastic instabilities well away from in-
stability strains, and well before destabilizing modes do.
This is the case since NPMs do not ‘compete’ with other
low-frequency modes for their identity as the lowest-lying
normal mode. They therefore do not suﬀer hybridizations
with other modes, which leads to the preservation of their
spatial structure remarkably far (in strain) from plastic
instabilities. This superior robustness of NPMs identities
renders their spatial distribution useful as means for a
microstructural characterization of disordered solids that
controls plastic deformation rates.

In this work we present a complete micromechanical
theory for the deformation-dynamics of NPMs (i.e. their
evolution under imposed deformations) and their asso-
ciated stiﬀnesses upon approaching plastic instabilities.
The latter are compared to the deformation-dynamics of
the conventional set of ‘linear’ observables, namely the
destabilizing eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix and
their associated eigenvalues. In addition to demonstrat-
ing the persistence of NPM’s identities over very large
strain scales away from plastic instabilities, we further
show that NPMs converge much faster scaling-wise to
their form at the instability strains, compared to desta-
bilizing eigenmodes. We present a scaling analysis that
explains the qualitative diﬀerences observed between the
deformation-dynamics of these two types of modes.

This manuscript is organized as follows: in Sect. II we
brieﬂy describe the numerical methods and models used
in this work. Further details about the numerics and
algorithms used are provided in the Appendix, as are ex-
planations of the tensor notations used throughout our

work. In Sect. III we review the conventional microme-
chanical theory of plastic instabilities, discuss its range of
applicability, and validate the theory against numerical
simulations. In Sect. IV we reintroduce the barrier func-
tion, put forward ﬁrst in [9], from which the deﬁnition
of NPMs emerges. We present results from a numerical
investigation of the spatial properties of NPMs which are
important for understanding NPMs deformation dynam-
ics. We further present the micromechanical theory that
describes the deformation dynamics of stiﬀnesses associ-
ated with NPMs. In Sect. V we derive the micromechan-
ical theory for the deformation dynamics of destabilizing
modes and NPMs, and present data from numerical sim-
ulations that validate the theory’s predictions. We end
with a summary and discussion in Sect. VI.

II. METHODS AND MODELS

We provide here a brief overview of the numerics used
in our work; a complete and detailed description is pro-
vided in the Appendix. We employed a simple glass for-
mer in two dimensions that consists of point-like particles
interacting via inverse power-law purely repulsive pair-
wise potentials. We expect our results to be independent
of this particular choice of model. An example of a snap-
shot of our model glass with N = 1600 is displayed in
Fig. 1a. We investigated systems of N = 402, 802, 1602
and 3202 particles; for each system size, we selected a sin-
gle realization for which the ﬁrst plastic instability upon
shearing occured at a strain γc (cid:38) 10−3. No other consid-
erations were used when selecting each realization for the
subsequent analyses carried out. All deformation simula-
tions were carried out under athermal, quasi-static con-
ditions, and the imposed deformation was simple shear

III. PLASTIC INSTABILITIES AS REFLECTED

BY ATOMISTIC LINEAR ELASTICITY

In this Section we review the conventional atomistic
theory of plastic instabilities in disordered elastic solids.
The majority of the formalism presented in this Section
appears in e.g. [7, 8, 10, 11]; it is summarized here for
the sake of completeness.

We consider a disordered system of N particles in ¯d di-
mensions, enclosed in a box of volume Ω under periodic
boundary conditions, and interacting via some potential
energy U ((cid:126)x) which is a function of the particles’ coor-
dinates (cid:126)x. Here and in all that follows, we restrict the
discussion to the athermal limit T → 0, with T denot-
ing the temperature. In the athermal limit, as long as
it is mechanically stable, the system resides in a local
minimum of the potential energy, i.e. in a state (cid:126)x0 of me-
chanical equilibrium. This means that (i) ∂U
= 0 and
∂(cid:126)x
(ii) all eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix M ≡ ∂2U
are non-negative (see Appendix for tensoric notation con-
ventions).

We next consider what happens when we deform our
solid under quasi-static shear deformation, and in partic-
ular, we study how the eigenvalues of M vary as defor-
mation is imposed. We start by writing the eigenmode
decomposition of the dynamical matrix as

M =

where the orthonormal eigenmodes ˆΨ(cid:96) satisfy the eigen-
value equation

(2)
and therefore λ(cid:96) = M : ˆΨ(cid:96) ˆΨ(cid:96). We aim to spell out
the deformation-dynamics of the eigenvalues, namely to
derive an equation for dλ(cid:96)
dγ . In the athermal limit, total
derivatives with respect to strain are taken according to

ing that mechanical equilibrium is preserved under the

with the boundary condition λp(γc) = 0, can be trivially

Let us review two important consequences of Eq. (9),
demonstrated in Fig. 1. First, on the macroscopic level,
the shear stress and modulus also show signatures of plas-
tic instabilities, that are derivable from Eq. (9); in the
athermal limit, the shear modulus is given by [7, 8, 12]

Consequently, the departure of the stress from its value

(12)

as illustrated in the cartoon in Fig. 1b, and shown in
e.g. [7].

Eq. (9) also leads to insights on the microscopic me-
chanics; we deﬁne δU ˆΨ(s) as the variation of the potential
energy upon displacing the particles about the inherent
state (cid:126)x0 according to δ(cid:126)x ≡ (cid:126)x − (cid:126)x0 = s ˆΨp. For small
distances s we can expand δU ˆΨ(s) as

(13)

Fig. 1d displays the energy variations δU ˆΨ(s) obtained at
various strains approaching a plastic instability strain γc.
The softening of the stiﬀness λp = d2U
ds2 upon approaching
the instability, as predicted by Eq. (9), is apparent, as is
the decreasing of the saddle point. From Eq. (13) we
deduce that the saddle point occurs at s(cid:63) = −2 λp
, with
a magnitude of δU ˆΨ(s(cid:63)) = 2
Eq. (9), as shown in [10, 11].

How far away from the instability strain γc is Eq. (9)
valid? This depends on the strain scale in which the de-
hybridization of the destabilizing mode from the lowest
plane-waves occurs, which can be estimated by compar-
ing the stiﬀness associated with the lowest energy shear-
wave in a system of linear size L, to the stiﬀness of the
destabilizing mode λp. The former is expected to scale

Eq. (9) is therefore expected to hold at up to strain in-
tervals γc − γ (cid:46) 1/(τpνpL4), as indeed shown to hold
numerically in Fig. 2. In what follows we will show that
this strain scale is central to the deformation dynamics
of destabilizing modes.

A.

Introduction and deﬁnitions

The strain scale 1/(τpνpL4) below which plastic insta-
bilities are robustly reﬂected by the destabilizing mode
quickly vanishes for large systems. An important ques-
tion is therefore whether modes that are indicative of
imminent plastic instabilities can be deﬁned and de-
tected away from instability strains, at scales γc − γ (cid:29)
1/(τpνpL4). In other words, is it possible to overcome the
diﬃculties associated with the hybridization of destabiliz-
ing modes with plane waves in the detection of imminent

to the aﬃrmative:
it was shown that nonlinear plastic
modes (NPMs) exhibit remarkable resemblance to dehy-
bridized destabilizing modes, and can be detected well
before plastic instabilities, deep in the regime where the
destabilizing mode is fully hybridized with plane waves.
The theoretical framework within which the deﬁnition
of NPMs emerges is constructed as follows: consider the
variation δUˆz(s) of the potential energy upon displacing
the particles about the inherent state (cid:126)x0, but this time
along a general collective displacement direction (mode)
ˆz (which may or may not be an eigenmode of M), namely
according to δ(cid:126)x = sˆz. For small s, it writes

δUˆz(s) (cid:39) 1

where we have introduced the stiﬀness κˆz ≡ M : ˆz ˆz and
the asymmetry τˆz ≡ U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) .
: ˆz ˆz ˆz associated with the collec-
tive displacement direction ˆz. Notice that the ﬁrst order
term in Eq. (14) is absent due to mechanical equilibrium,
and ˆz is dimensionless and normalized, i.e. ˆz· ˆz = 1. In its
truncated form Eq. (14), δUˆz possesses stationary points
at s = 0 and s(cid:63) = − 2κˆz
, corresponding respectively to
a minimum and maximum of the truncated potential en-

phasize that Eq. (14) diﬀers from Eq. (13) by describing
the energy variation upon displacing the particles along
a general direction ˆz in the former case, as oppose to
along the eigenmode ˆΨp in the latter.

We next deﬁne the truncated energy variation at the

maximum s(cid:63) as the ‘barrier function’ b(ˆz), namely

b(ˆz) ≡ 1

(15)

Notice that b(ˆz) is not a function of the reaction coordi-
nate s, but instead a function of the multi-dimensional
collective displacement direction ˆz. By construction,
modes ˆz for which b(ˆz) is small are characterized by
small stiﬀnesses κˆz and large asymmetries τˆz. This, in
turn, implies that the displacement distance s(cid:63) for those
modes is small, and therefore the cubic expansion at dis-
tances s ∼ s(cid:63) should be a faithful representation of the
actual variation of the potential energy upon displacing
the particles along ˆz, as demonstrated e.g. for destabi-
lizing modes in Fig. 1d. Thus, small enough b’s should
pertain to actual saddle points (energy barriers) that sep-
arate between the inherent structure in which the system
resides, and neighboring ones.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:126)z=ˆπ = 0, and all eigenvalues of the linear operator
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:126)z=ˆπ are non-negative. Local minima of b do not

NPMs are therefore deﬁned as modes ˆπ for which b at-
tains a local minimum. This means that modes ˆπ satisfy
∂b
∂(cid:126)z
∂2b
∂(cid:126)z∂(cid:126)z
guarantee the smallness of b, and therefore do not nec-
essarily faithfully indicate an actual instability direction.
Nevertheless, modes ˆπ that pertain to low-lying minima
of b are indicative of directions that take the system over
saddle points of the potential energy, and in particular
indicate imminent plastic instabilities, as shown in [9].

At this point it is useful to note that the barrier func-
tion is invariant to variations of the norm of its vector
argument, i.e. b(ˆz) = b(cˆz) for any ﬁnite c. This means
that the barrier function can be equivalently expressed
as a function of a set of N ¯d independent variables (cid:126)z, as

b((cid:126)z) =

In turn, this allows us to meaningfully take partial deriva-
tives with respect to those variables, and in particular

Eq. (18) tells us that the linear and nonlinear coeﬃcients
of the force response expansion are parallel N ¯d dimen-
sional vectors.

of a NPM ˆπ and of a destabilizing eigenmode ˆΨp calculated in a
system of N = 102400 at a distance γc − γ ∼ 10−14 away from a
plastic instability. Also plotted is the decay proﬁle of the response
δ (cid:126)R = M−1 (cid:126)d to a local dipolar force (cid:126)d. All these modes are found
to decay as r−1 (notice that C scales as the magnitude squared
of a mode’s components). b) The nonlinear force responses of
the same modes analyzed in panel a) decay as r−4. We verify
that the double contraction of a spatially-decaying mode with U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48),
e.g. U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48)
: ˆΨp ˆΨp, picks up the square of the spatial gradient of
that mode, in consistency with Eq. (20). Notice that the linear
and nonlinear force responses of the NPM ˆπ are parallel, therefore
|M · ˆπ|(r) ∼ r−4 as well, while |M · ˆΨ|(r) ∼ r−1.

What is the spatial structure of the said force response,
and in particular of the parallel vectors M · ˆπ and U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) :

of a disordered, localized core, decorated by long-range
largely-aﬃne displacement ﬁelds that decay away from
the core as |ˆπ|(r) ∼ r1− ¯d, where r denotes the distance
from the NPM’s core center. The force response (cid:126)Fˆπ is

tensor U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48); we therefore expect the relative magnitude of
the force response away from the NPM’s core to scale as
the gradient squared of ˆπ, namely

| (cid:126)Fˆπ|(r) ∼ |∇ˆπ|2(r) ∼ r−2 ¯d .

(20)

This relation is further motivated in the Appendix, for
the simple case of pairwise central-force potentials.
To verify Eq. (20) numerically, we deﬁne the spatial de-
cay proﬁles C(cid:126)v(r) which are calculated on a vector (cid:126)v by
taking the median over the square of all components of
the normalized ˆv that are situated at a distance ≈ r away
from the core of a plastic instability, see [9] for further
details. In Fig. 3a we plot the decay proﬁles of a NPM ˆπ
(calculated as explained in the Appendix) and a desta-
bilizing mode ˆΨp measured close to a plastic instability.
These decay proﬁles are compared to that calculated for
the displacement response δ (cid:126)R = M−1 (cid:126)d to a local dipo-
lar force (cid:126)d (as described in e.g. [14]) in an undeformed
solid. All three modes are found to decay as r−1 (in
our two-dimensional simulations). In Fig. 3b we plot the
spatial decay proﬁles of the double contractions of these
three modes with the third-order tensor U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48). We indeed
ﬁnd that Cˆπ ∼ r−2 and CM·ˆπ ∼ CU(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48):ˆπ ˆπ ∼ r−8 implying
that |ˆπ|(r) ∼ r−1, and |M· ˆπ|(r) ∼ |U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) : ˆπˆπ|(r) ∼ r−4,
supporting Eq. (20).

The above discussion and the data plotted in Fig. 3
lead to an interesting conclusion: although destabilizing
modes and NPMs share the same spatial decay proﬁles,
the linear force responses M−1 · ˆΨp and M−1 · ˆπ do not;
the former decay away from the disordered core as r1− ¯d
(just as the destabilizing modes themselves), whereas the
latter decay as r−2 ¯d.

B. Dynamics of NPM stiﬀnesses

We next show that the deformation dynamics of NPMs
stiﬀnesses κˆπ = M : ˆπˆπ and of the eigenvalues λp =
M : ˆΨp ˆΨp obey the same equation of motion close to
plastic instabilities. The total derivative with respect to
deformation of the stiﬀness reads

The vanishing of κˆπ upon plastic instabilities also implies
dγ | (cid:46) |M · ˆπ|−1 as
that |M · ˆπ| → 0. Assuming that | dˆπ
plastic instabilities are approached (an assumption that
will be established in the following Section), and recalling
that ∂M
∂γ is always regular, the last two terms in the RHS
of the above equation can be neglected close to plastic
instabilities, and we are left with

This limiting diﬀerential equation is identical in structure
to Eq. (9) for the deformation dynamics of the eigenval-

therefore solved by

the κˆπ’s as γ → γc. b) Rescaling the stiﬀnesses by their asymptotic
form κˆπ (cid:39) √
γc − γ veriﬁes Eq. (24), and shows that this
scaling breaks down at a strain scale with no clear system-size
dependence, in stark contrast with the eigenvalues λp shown in
Fig. 2. Nevertheless, up to strain intervals γc − γ (cid:46) 10−3, we
ﬁnd that the deviations from the asymptotic form remain less than
roughly 50%.

One important observation to note is that Eq. (24) is
followed over large strain intervals γc− γ, without a clear
system-size dependence, as can be seen in Fig. 4. This

of destabilizing modes as described by Eq. (9), which
is only valid over scales γc − γ (cid:46) L−4. This diﬀerence
arises since NPMs do not ‘compete’ for their identity with
other low-frequency normal modes, i.e. they do not suﬀer
hybridizations.

One obvious limitation on the range over which
Eq. (24) is valid is the extent of typical elastic branches
between consecutive plastic instabilities, which has been
shown to vanish as N−β with β ≈ 2/3 [1, 15]. We there-
fore assert that above some system size the deformation
dynamics of NPMs associated with imminent plastic in-
stabilities will always be described by Eq. (24).

Finally, we underline an important consequence of the
simultaneous vanishing of the eigenmode λp and the stiﬀ-
ness κ at the same instability strain: both the destabiliz-
ing mode ˆΨ and the NPM ˆπ must converge to a common
ﬁnal form at the instability strain, since at that point
they both satisfy M· ˆΨp = M· ˆπ = 0 and must therefore
be equal. This convergence of the two modes at a plastic
instability is validated in Fig. 5.

FIG. 5. a) The NPM ˆπ and the destabilizing mode ˆΨp converge to
a common ﬁnal form at the instability strain γc, as indicated by the
vanishing of 1−ˆπ· ˆΨp. b) We ﬁnd that 1−ˆπ· ˆΨp ∼ γc−γ, see Sect. V
for a theoretical explanation of this scaling. We also ﬁnd that the
same strain scale δγ ∼ 1/(τpνpL4) controls the convergence of both
modes to their common ﬁnal form.

V. DEFORMATION DYNAMICS OF LINEAR

AND NONLINEAR MODES

We have seen theoretically and numerically that the
stiﬀnesses associated with destabilizing modes and NPMs
are enslaved to the same equation of motion at scales

7
γc − γ (cid:46) L−4 away from to plastic instabilities. Is there
a similar equivalence between the deformation-dynamics
of the destabilizing mode and that of the NPM? In this
section we derive exact equations of motion for the NPM
and destabilizing mode associated with a plastic insta-
bility. A scaling analysis close to the instability reveals
the surprising ﬁnding that the deformation-dynamics of
these two mode types follow diﬀerent scaling laws, both
with respect to the distance to the instability strain, and
with respect to system size. In particular, we ﬁnd that

destabilizing eigenmodes,(cid:12)(cid:12) d ˆΨp

text) reveals that the same strain scale δγ ∼ 1/(τpνpL4) controls
the deformation dynamics of destabilizing modes, as well as their
associated eigenvalues.

We begin the exploration of the modes’ deformation

dynamics by constructing the stiﬀness function

˜κ((cid:126)z) ≡ M : (cid:126)z(cid:126)z
(cid:126)z · (cid:126)z

,

(26)

which is a function of a general N ¯d-dimensional vec-
tor (cid:126)z, whose single global minimum occurs at ˆΨp, and
˜κ( ˆΨp) = λp is the lowest eigenvalue of M. Notice that
˜κ((cid:126)z) as deﬁned above and κ(cid:126)z ≡ M : (cid:126)z(cid:126)z diﬀer by the
normalization that appears in the former but not in the
latter. The gradient of ˜κ with respect to (cid:126)z reads

The analysis of the scaling properties of Eqs. (34) and
(35) with respect to γc − γ starts with realizing that ˆΨp
and ˆπ are zero modes of ∂(cid:126)Γ

∂γ are expected to con-
verge to regular values at plastic instabilities as well. We
conclude thus that any singularity that d ˆΨp
dγ might
possess can only be inherited from the singularity of d(cid:126)x

(recall that | d(cid:126)x

dγ| ∼ (γc − γ)−1/2).

The deformation dynamics of the destabilizing mode

U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) : ˆΨp ˆΨp − τp ˆΨp as appears in Eq. (36), at large r.
This diﬀerence therefore couples strongly to the lowest-
lying eigenmodes of M−λpI in Eq. (36), which are plane
waves with frequencies of order L−1. This is further cor-
roborated in Fig. 8, where we plot the ﬁeld d ˆΨp

frequency plane waves of the system. We thus expect

derivatives of the potential energy. It is clear that the
last two terms on the RHS of the above equation are
not singular (they are proportional to κˆz/λp which ap-
proaches unity at the instability strain). We therefore
focus for a moment on the ﬁrst two terms on the RHS of
Eq. (38); notice that

the instability strain is approached ∆ ≡ |(cid:126)∆| → 0, then
we can express (cid:126)∆ as the solution to either one of the

The two above equations are nothing more than the linear
expansion of the respective gradients of ˜κ and b about
their minima at ˆΨp and ˆπ, respectively.

We focus on Eq. (40) since it is simpler in structure;
taking the partial derivatives, inverting in favor of (cid:126)∆, and
using Eq. (18), we ﬁnd

(cid:126)∆ (cid:39) κˆπ

Furthermore, as Eq. (42) is similar in structure to
Eq. (36), similar considerations as previously spelled out
for d ˆΨp
dγ apply here as well, and in particular that the far
ﬁeld of U(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) : ˆπˆπ − τˆπ ˆπ is dominated by the slow decay
of ˆπ (∼ r1− ¯d see Fig. 3).
It therefore couples strongly
to the lowest-lying eigenmodes of M − λpI, leading to
the prediction ∆ ∼ L2λp, shown to hold numerically in
Fig. (10). By directly comparing Eqs. (36) to (42), we
conclude that as γ → γc

(cid:126)∆ ≡ ˆπ − ˆΨ (cid:39) λ2

(43)

which means that (cid:126)∆ has the structure of the lowest-
frequency plane-wave, as can be seen in Fig. 8.

C. Predictiveness of NPMs

In the previous two subsections we have shown that
there is a dramatic diﬀerence between the deformation-
dynamics of destabilizing modes compared to that of
NPMs. Although their associated stiﬀnesses share the
same scaling with γc−γ close to instabilities (see Eqs. (9)
and (24)), the two types of modes exhibit diﬀerent scal-
ing laws in their variation rate as an instability is ap-
proached, and in particular

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) d ˆΨp

but

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) dˆπ

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)2 ∼ constant .

To what degree do destabilizing modes and NPMs in-
dicate their common ﬁnal form away from the instability

strain? This can be quantiﬁed by considering the diﬀer-
ences 1− ˆπ(γ)· ˆπ(γc) and 1− ˆΨp(γ)· ˆΨp(γc) for the NPM
and the destabilizing mode cases, respectively. The for-
mer can be easily estimated by Taylor expanding ˆπ(γ)
around γc (which is possible due to its regularity), lead-
ing to the prediction

1 − ˆπ(γ) · ˆπ(γc) ∼ (γc − γ)2 ,

(44)

where we have used that dˆπ

dγ · ˆπ = 0.

FIG. 11. 1− ˆπ(γ)· ˆπ(γc) (outlined symbols) and 1− ˆΨp(γ)· ˆΨp(γc)
(solid symbols) vs. γc − γ. NPMs converge must faster scaling-wise
to their ﬁnal form at instabilities compared to destabilizing modes,
and are therefore better predictors of imminent plastic instabilities.

The destabilizing mode case is slightly more subtle due
to the singularity in its derivative as seen in Eq. (36).
However, since the said singularity is integrable, we can
deﬁne

with the norm |δ(cid:126)Ψ| ∼ L2√
γc − γ following Eq. (37). No-
tice that |δ(cid:126)Ψ|2 = 2−2 ˆΨp(γc)· ˆΨp(γ), therefore we predict

1 − ˆΨp(γc) · ˆΨp(γ) ∼ L4(γc − γ) .

(45)

The scaling laws Eqs. (44) and (45) are veriﬁed numer-
ically in Fig. 11. They further explain the observation
that away from instabilities the overlaps 1 − ˆπ · ˆΨp ∼
L4(γc − γ), as seen in Fig. 5:
since NPMs converge
very quickly to their ﬁnal forms at the instability, ˆπ · ˆΨp
is bounded by the convergence rate of the destabilizing
mode, as given by Eq. (45).

Besides the diﬀerence in convergence rates between the
two mode types as seen in Fig. 11, perhaps the most
striking feature of this data is the typical value measured

δ(cid:126)Ψ ≡ ˆΨp(γc) − ˆΨp(γ) =

scales on the order of 10−3 away from the instability. At
these strains the overlaps with the ﬁnal form of the NPMs
agree up to a few tenths of a percent, indicating that once
detected, NPMs are nearly perfect indicators of the locus
and geometry of imminent plastic instabilities.

VI. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

We have carried out a comparative theoretical and nu-
merical analysis of the deformation dynamics of nonlin-
ear plastic modes and destabilizing eigenmodes upon ap-
proaching plastic instabilities. We have found that al-
though the stiﬀnesses associated with these two mode
types follow the same scaling with strain, the modes
themselves vary with vastly diﬀerent rates as instabilities
are approached. Not only do NPMs not suﬀer from hy-
bridizations with low frequency normal modes as destabi-
lizing modes do, but their variation rate is regular upon
approaching plastic instabilities, in stark contrast with
the singular variation rate of destabilizing modes. These
results add substantial support to the usefulness of NPMs
as robust plasticity predictors, and to the role NPMs’
spatial distribution may play as a state variable that con-
trols the rate of plastic deformation in glasses subjected
to external loading.

The picture that emerges from our study is that the
system size and strain dependence in the deformation dy-
namics of destabilizing mode stems from the dehybridiza-
tion process that continues to take place all the way up to
the instability strain. We ﬁnd that close to plastic insta-
bilities the destabilizing mode can be obtained by adding
a plane-wave-like mode with an amplitude proportional
γc − γ to the NPM. This interpretation suggests
that the most relevant objects to plastic ﬂow in disor-
dered solids are NPMs, and that research eﬀorts should
be focused on studying their statistics and dynamics.

2νˆπτˆπ

Our analysis reveals that a NPM ˆπ is characterized
by three key physical parameters: the stiﬀness κˆπ, the
asymmetry τˆπ, and the shear-force coupling νˆπ. A local
instability strain can be deﬁned using these parameters
as δγˆπ ≡ κ2
, following Eq. (24). While similar modes
are expected to form local minima of δγˆz (written as a
function of a general N ¯d-dimensional displacement direc-
tion ˆz) and of the barrier function b(ˆz) reintroduced in
this work, the deformation dynamics as presented in this
work do not strictly speaking hold for minima of δγˆz.
One can nevertheless use δγˆπ (i.e. evaluated at NPMs
ˆπ calculated using the barrier function) as an indicator
of the proximity of an individual NPM to its particular
plastic instability strain.

samples of the prefactors of the scaling κˆπ ∼ √

that destabilized. In other words, can the post-instability
consequences be predicted based on pre-instability infor-
mation? Considering e.g. the observed variance between
γc − γ,
and of the variation rates dˆπ
dγ , it is possible that besides
predicting the strain at which an NPM would destabilize,
this information might be indicative of post-instability
mechanics.

In this work we did not touch upon the important task
of a-priori detecting of the entire ﬁeld of NPMs of a solid.
The usefulness of the NPM framework clearly hinges on
the availability of computational methods that are able to
robustly detect this ﬁeld and monitor its statistics and
dynamics. Such methods are currently under develop-
ment, and are left for future studies.

In this work we omit particle indices with the goal of
improving the clarity and readability of the text. We de-
note N ¯d-dimensional vectors as (cid:126)v, each component per-
tains to some particle index i and a particular Carte-

Appendix B: Models and numerical methods

We employ a 50:50 binary mixture of ‘large’ and ‘small’
particles of equal mass m in two dimensions, interacting
via radially-symmetric purely repulsive inverse power-law
pairwise potentials, that follow

One important question we leave for future research
is whether correlations exist between the amount of en-
ergy dissipated in an elementary shear transformation,
and the parameters τˆπ and νˆπ associated with the NPM

distance for which ϕIPL vanishes continuously up to q
derivatives. Distances are measured in terms of the in-
teraction lengthscale a between two ‘small’ particles, and
the rest are chosen to be aij = 1.18a for one ‘small’ and
one ‘large’ particle, and aij = 1.4a for two ‘large’ parti-
cles. The coeﬃcients c2(cid:96) are given by

We chose the parameters xc = 1.48, n = 10, and q = 3.
The density was set to be N/V = 0.86a−2. This model
undergoes a computer-glass-transition around the tem-
perature Tg ≈ 0.5ε/kB. Solids were created by a fast
quench from the melt to a target temperature T (cid:28) Tg,
followed by an energy minimization using a standard non-
linear conjugate gradient algorithm. Systems were de-
formed by imposing simple shear, meaning that the co-
ordinates xi, yi of each particle were displaced according
to

xi → xi + δγyi ,
yi → yi ,

(B3)
(B4)

where δγ is the strain increment, chosen to be smaller
than 10−3. 128-bit numerics were employed, which en-
abled us to approach instabilities up to γc − γ ≈ 10−14.
Once each system was brought as closely as possible
to the ﬁrstly encountered plastic instability, the lowest
eigenmode of M was calculated by minimizing the stiﬀ-
ness function ˜κ((cid:126)z) as given by Eq. (26) over directions
(cid:126)z. The minimization was carried out via a standard non-
linear conjugate gradient algorithm, while the norm of (cid:126)z

12

was monitored and maintained during the minimization.
˜κ has a single minimum at the lowest eigenmode ˆΨp of
M, which is uncovered upon convergence of the mini-
mizer. This allows us to start this minimization with
any random initial conditions ˆzini; the minimization is
guaranteed to terminate with ˆΨp.

Once calculated, the eigenmode ˆΨp found close to an
instability strain γc is then used for all subsequent calcu-
lations of nonlinear plastic modes away from the insta-
bility strain. This is done at each strain by minimizing
the barrier function b((cid:126)z) as given by Eq. (16), with the
eigenmode ˆΨp
as the initial conditions for the min-
imization. The same minimization code for ˜κ((cid:126)z) is used
for minimizing b((cid:126)z).

(cid:12)(cid:12)γ→γc

Derivatives with respect to strain of eigenmodes ˆΨp
and NPMs were calculated by ﬁnite diﬀerences. The re-
sults were validated close to the instability strains by
directly solving Eqs. (34) and (35).

∂(cid:126)x∂(cid:126)x∂(cid:126)x with a ﬁeld characterized by some
