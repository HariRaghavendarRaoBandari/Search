Abstract

This paper deals with the steady-state polytropic ﬂuid accretion
onto a higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr¨om black hole. We formu-
late the generalized mass ﬂux conservation equation, energy ﬂux con-
servation and relativistic Bernoulli equation to discuss the accretion
process. The critical accretion is investigated by ﬁnding critical ra-
dius, critical sound velocity and critical ﬂow velocity. We also explore
gas compression and temperature proﬁles to analyze the asymptotic
behavior. It is found that the results for Schwarzschild black hole are
recovered when q = 0 in four dimensions. We conclude that accretion
process in higher dimensions becomes slower in the presence of charge.

Introduction

Black hole (BH) is one of the celestial objects having strong gravitational pull
that the nearby matter even light cannot escape from its gravitational ﬁeld.
There are diﬀerent ways to detect BH in binary systems and center of galaxies

as it cannot be observed directly. The detection of its eﬀect on the nearby
matter is the one way and the most promising is accretion. In astrophysics,
accretion is deﬁned as the inward ﬂow of matter surrounding a compact
object under the inﬂuence of gravitational ﬁeld. Recent developments in the
study of quasars luminosity, relationship among masses of massive BHs and
the properties of their host galaxies motivated the idea of accretion onto BHs
[1].

Like most of the substances in the universe, all accreting matter is in
gaseous form. The problem of gas accretion by a star was ﬁrst studied by
Hoyle and Lyttleton [2] and later by Bondi and Hoyle [3]. The steady-state
spherically symmetric accretion was considered by Bondi [4] in which star
was considered at rest at inﬁnite gas cloud. In his classical model, he studied
the ﬂow of a barotropic ﬂuid in the context of Newtonian gravity. Michel
[5] extended this work in the framework of GR by investigating steady-state
spherically symmetric inﬂow of gas onto Schwarzschild BH. Other important
studies in this context are luminosity and frequency spectrum, the eﬀect of
magnetic ﬁeld on accreting ionized gases and accretion onto a rotating BH
[6]. Malec [7] investigated relativistic spherically symmetric accretion onto a
BH with and without back reaction. He found that relativistic eﬀects raise
accretion mass in the absence of back reaction.

Shatskiy and Andreev [8] studied accretion onto a non-rotating compact
object in comoving frame and explored dynamics of event horizon formation.
Jamil et al. [9] analyzed the eﬀect of phantom like dark energy onto Reissner-
Nordstr¨om (RN) BH and found that accretion is possible only through outer
horizon. Jamil and Akbar [10] investigated accretion of exotic phantom en-
ergy onto (2 + 1)-dimensional Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) BH and
showed that mass accretion due to phantom energy is independent of BH
mass. Babichev et al. [11] described steady-state spherically symmetric ac-
cretion of a perfect ﬂuid as well as scalar ﬁeld onto RN BH and found the
formation of static atmosphere of ﬂuid around naked singularity. The same
authors [12] studied accretion of spherically symmetric metric with back re-
action and showed that the metric is of Vaidya form near the horizon using
perturbation. de Freitas Pacheco [13] examined relativistic as well as non-
relativistic accretion onto RN BH using two equations of state (EOS) and
found that accretion was slightly aﬀected in the ﬁrst case while in the second
case it reduced upto 60% then the schwarzschild BH (for extreme RN case).
Sharif and Abbas [14] investigated phantom accretion onto a magnetically
stringy charged BH and found that BH does not transform into extremal BH

or naked singularity.

Recently, Park and Ricotti [15] studied the increase in luminosity and
growth rates of BHs moving at super sonic speed. Gaspari et al.
[16]
suggested that cooling rates are tightly linked to the BH accretion rates
( ˙MBH ≈ ˙Mcool,core) in the galactic core. Karkowski and Malec [17] studied
steady accretion onto BH that is immersed in a cosmological universe and
found that dark energy may halt this type of accretion. Babichev et al.
[18] investigated the interaction of dark energy with Schwarzschild as well
as RN BH and gave physical reasons of decrease in mass due to accretion of
phantom energy. Ganguly et al.
[19] examined the process of accretion on
4-dimensional string cloud and found an increase in the accretion rate with
respect to string cloud parameter.

The study of gravity in a theory such as braneworld (which implies the
existence of extra dimensions) has attracted many people from the last few
decades. This theory is based on the fact that (3 + 1)-dimensional brane
is embedded in a (4 + n)-dimensional spacetime with n compact space-
like dimensions [20]. It is suggested that in braneworld theory, the eﬀects
of quantum gravity can be observed in laboratory at TeV energies. Also,
these theories recommend that higher-dimensional BHs can be produced in
large hadron colliders and cosmic ray experiments. With the development of
higher-dimensional theories [21], it would thus be interesting to study BHs
in higher-dimensions

Tangherlini [22] was the pioneer in generalization of Schwarzschild BH in
higher dimensions. Dadhich et al. [23] found the ﬁrst static spherically sym-
metric BH solution in higher dimensions in the context of braneworld, which
has the same structure as 4-dimensional RN BH. The physics of higher dimen-
sional BH is much diﬀerent and richer than in 4-dimensions [24]. Accretion
in higher-dimensions onto TeV-scale BHs was ﬁrst studied by Giddings and
Mangano [25] in Newtonian background. Sharif and Abbas [26] investigated
phantom energy accretion onto a 5-dimensional charged BH and found the
validity of cosmic censorship hypothesis. John et al.
[27] examined steady
state accretion onto higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH and found decrease
in accretion mass. Debnath [28] studied accretion onto higher-dimensional
charged BTZ BH assuming modiﬁed Chaplygin gas as accreting matter and
found that initially BH mass increases and then decreases to a certain ﬁnite
value for phantom stage.

In this paper, we study steady-state accretion onto a D-dimensional RN
BH using the technique of Michel [5] as well as Shapiro and Teukolsky [29].

The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we study analytic relativistic
perfect ﬂuid accretion onto RN BH in higher dimensions. Section 3 inves-
tigates accretion on critical points. We also study critical accretion with
polytropic EOS and obtain expressions for gas compression and temperature
proﬁle near horizon. Finally, we summarize and discuss the results in the
last section.

2 General Formalism for Spherical Accretion

In this section, we develop a general framework for accretion onto a higher-
dimensional spacetime and study laws of conservation of mass and energy.
The static spherically symmetric higher-dimensional RN BH is given by [30]

ds2 = −f (r)dt2 + f −1(r)dr2 + r2(dΩ2

D−2),

(1)

where D is the spacetime dimension and

respectively. When q2 > µ2, this solution develops singularity at r = 0 while
for q2 ≤ µ2, f (r) has two real roots

r± = (µ ± µs1 −

where r+ is the outer horizon and r− is the Cauchy horizon.

We consider steady-state inﬂow of gas onto central mass of BH in radial
direction. The gas is assumed to be a perfect ﬂuid speciﬁed by the energy-
momentum tensor

T συ = (ρ + p)uσuυ + pgσυ.

(2)

Here p and ρ are the pressure and energy density of the ﬂuid and uσ = dxσ
ds is
the ﬂuid D-velocity which satisﬁes the normalization condition uσuσ = −1.
We also deﬁne the baryon number ﬂux J σ = nuσ, where n is the proper
baryon number density. The accretion process depends upon two laws of
conservation. If no particles are created or destroyed then the particle number
is conserved, i.e.,

The law of conservation of energy-momentum tensor gives

∇σJ σ = ∇σ(nuσ) = 0.

3 Critical Accretion

This section is devoted to study the solutions passing through critical points
that describe the material falling into BH with increasing velocity. The
behavior of falling ﬂuid at critical points can express a variety of changes
close to the compact objects. The speed of sound in the medium is also
very important for a ﬂuid as shown in the classical paper by Bondi [4]. We
consider an adiabatic ﬂuid for which there is no entropy production, hence
the law of conservation of mass energy is deﬁned as [29]

T dS = 0 = d(

ρ
n

) + pd(

where S is the entropy per baryon and T is the temperature.

For large values of r (r → ∞), the ﬂow satisﬁes ν2 ≪ 1 and is subsonic
(ν2 < α2) while the sound speed must be sub-luminal (α2 < 1), thus Eq.(15)
implies that

At the event horizon, we have

X =

under the causality constraint α2 < 1. It is mentioned here that Eq.(17) is
possible only for the extreme RN case, i.e., for q = µ. From Eq.(16) and (17),
we see that X must pass through zero at r = rc. A ﬂow with constant energy
and entropy must be smooth at every point. Thus, if denominator vanishes
at some point, the numerator must also vanish at that point, so for a smooth
ﬂow we must have X1 = X2 = X = 0 at r = rc [29]. From Eqs.(13)-(15), we
obtain a relationship between ﬂow and sound velocity as

In the absence of charge parameter in
four-dimensions, the above relation is exactly the same as obtained in [27].

the generalization of the Bondi’s accretion rate in higher-dimensions. For
q = 0 and D = 4, it reduces to the Schwarzschild case.

This equation leads to two possible solutions for the critical radius corre-

the event horizon which is a physically acceptable solution. The second pos-
sibility shows the critical radius between inner and outer horizons [9].
In
the present analysis, we are interested only in the ﬁrst solution. In the limit
D = 4, our results correspond to [13, 18].

The physical state of homogeneous substance can be described by EoS. In
˙M as well as all the fundamental
order to determine an explicit value of
characteristics of ﬂow, Eqs.(19) and (21) must be analyzed using EoS. We
consider the polytropic EoS

For large values of r (r > rc), the baryons are expected to be non-

3.2 Asymptotic Analysis

Here we estimate the ﬂow parameters for rH < r ≪ rc as well as r = rc.
The gas passes through supersonic ﬂow at distance below Bondi radius, i.e.,
ν > α when rH < r ≪ rc. We ﬁnd an upper bound of the radial dependence
of gas velocity [27, 29]

expressions correspond to the spherical accretion onto Schwarzschild BH [29].

4 Concluding Remarks

It is believed that matter accreting onto a gravitating body is the source of
power supply in closed binary systems, galactic nuclei and quasars [31]. There
has been a growing interest to study theories which predict gravity in extra
dimensions such as string theories and braneworld cosmology. This paper
provides the eﬀect of steady-state spherically symmetric adiabatic accretion
onto a charged D-dimensional BH and explores critical accretion following
Michel [5] as well as Shapiro and Teukolsky [29]. The critical radius and
mass accretion rate as well as the gas compression and temperature proﬁle
(below the critical radius and at the event horizon) are found. It turns out
˙M
that mass accretion rate depends upon BH mass and dimensions. Also,
is modiﬁed by the term f (e) which continuously decreases as the dimension
increases and the accretion rate for large values of charge is less than that
of small values. We observe that accretion rate decreases gradually but the
process is slower than the higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH [27]. We
conclude that the accretion rate of charged BH slows down in higher dimen-
sions.
It is interesting to mention here that all our results for q = 0 and
D = 4 correspond to accretion rate of Schwarzschild BH. This leads to the
generalization of the results presented in [5, 29] in terms of accretion onto a
charged BH in higher-dimensions.
