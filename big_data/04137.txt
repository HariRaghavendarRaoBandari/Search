Abstract

It is known that BMS symmetry is the asymptotic symmetry of the asymptotically ﬂat

spacetimes at null inﬁnity. There are some proposals which extend this symmetry to spatial

inﬁnity. In this paper we propose appropriate boundary conditions at spatial inﬁnity of four

dimensional spacetimes which result in BMS4 symmetry. Then we propose a holographic dual

theory which lives at spatial inﬁnity. The correlation functions of this theory are given by

contraction of a conformal ﬁeld theory. Thus we call it contracted conformal ﬁeld theory

(CCFT). As the ﬁrst step, we ﬁnd a stress tensor for the Kerr black hole written in the Boyer-

Lindquist coordinate. To do so, we use the dictionary of the Flat/CCFT correspondence and

take the ﬂat-space limit from the quasi-local stress tensor of the four-dimensional Kerr-AdS

black hole. The proposed stress tensor yields the correct values for the mass and angular

momentum of the Kerr black hole at spatial inﬁnity.

Introduction

Taking the ﬂat-space limit from the calculations of gravity side in the AdS/CFT correspondence

can be used to make some progress in the ﬂat-space holography. The main question is the

corresponding operation of the ﬂat-space limit in the boundary theory. There is a proposal in

[1],[2] that connects the ﬂat-space limit of asymptotically AdS spacetimes in the bulk side to the

ultra-relativistic contraction of the boundary CFT. This proposal is based on the observation

that asymptotic symmetry of asymptotic ﬂat spacetimes at null inﬁnity (which is known as BMS

symmetry[3]-[7]) is isomorphic to an Inono-Wigner contraction of conformal symmetry.

It is known that the original coordinates in which the asymtotically AdS spacetimes are

written are important in taking the ﬂat-space limit. In three dimensions, one can use a BMS

coordinate for writing generic asymptotically AdS spacetimes and take the ﬂat-space limit [8]. The

ﬁnal spacetimes are appropriate for studying problems at null inﬁnity. Using these spacetimes, it

has been shown in [8] that the BMS3 symmetry which is the asymptotic symmetry at null inﬁnity

of three dimensional spacetimes is given by taking suitable limit from the conformal symmetry.

One may expect the same story in four dimensions and start with a generic solution of

asymptotically AdS spacetimes in four dimensions written in the BMS gauge. One would then

take the ﬂat space limit and ﬁnd the generic asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes. As it was reviewed

in paper [9], the angular part of metric in the asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes, expanded in powers

of radial coordinate, has some terms which are absent for the asymptotically AdS case (see

formula (2.54) and (2.103) of [9]). Thus, it seems that the BMS gauge is not appropriate in

four dimensions when one wants to study asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes by taking ﬂat space

limit from the asymptotically AdS spacetimes. However this is not the end of story and it is

straightforward to check that the ﬂat-space limit of the Kerr-AdS black hole written in the Boyer-

Lindquist coordinates yields the Kerr solution in the same coordinate. Therefore we expect that

holographic calculations for the Kerr-AdS black hole in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence

can be well-deﬁned in the ﬂat-space limit when one uses the proposal in [2].

However, for the ﬁnite time the radial coordinate of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate at inﬁnity

ends on spatial inﬁnity rather than null inﬁnity. On the other hand, it is known that the BMS

symmetry is the asymptotic symmetry of the asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes at null inﬁnity. Thus,

performing holographic calculations in the Boyer- Lindquist coordinate requires extension of the

BMS symmetry to spatial inﬁnity. It was argued in [7],[16] that by deﬁning a modiﬁed bracket,

the BMS symmetry makes sense every where in the spacetime. Thus one can conclude that the

BMS symmetry is also the asymptotic symmetry at spatial inﬁnity of the asymptotically ﬂat

spacetimes. In fact the same result was established in [2] for spatial inﬁnity by taking the ﬂat

2

limit from the asymptotic killing vectors of AdS spacetimes written in the global coordinate. In

this paper we complete the calculation of [2] and propose appropriate boundary conditions at

spatial inﬁnity which result in generators of BMS symmetry.

Using this symmetry, we can propose a holographic dual for the asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes

at spatial inﬁnity. The correlators of the dual ﬁeld theory are given by the contraction of a
CFT. Thus we call it contracted CFT (CCFT)1. The correspondence between asymptotically ﬂat

spacetimes and CCFTs can be used to propose a quasi local stress tensor for asymptotically ﬂat

spacetimes [10]. This proposal has also been checked for three dimensional Rindler space times

[11] , three dimensional hairy black holes [12] and the derivation of ultra-relativistic conformal

anomaly in [13]. The proposed stress tensor also generates the correct values for the conserved

charges. In this paper, we also use the proposal of [10] to ﬁnd a stress tensor for the Kerr black

hole in four dimensions. The starting point is the standard calculation of AdS/CFT for the quasi

local stress tensor of the Kerr-AdS written in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate. We take the limit

from this stress tensor and ﬁnd a stress tensor that yields correct values of mass and angular

momentum of the Kerr black hole .

To ﬁnd charges, we use the Brown and York’s method [14] which requires a timelike hy-

persurface. The charges are given by integrating over this timelike surface. For the Kerr-AdS

this hypersurface is the boundary of the spacetime, but choosing this hypersurface for the Kerr

solution is challenging. We use a method that was previously tested in [10]-[13] and relate this hy-

persurface to the three dimensional spacetime in which the dual contracted conformal ﬁeld theory

lives on. It was proposed in [10] that the geometry of spacetimes, in which contracted CFT lives

on, is the same as original CFT but with a contracted time coordinate. For the asymptotically

ﬂat spacetimes, this approach deﬁnes a conformal inﬁnity that is given by anisotropic scaling of

the metric components. This may have some roots in the connection between the BMS symmetry

as asymptotic symmetry of asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes and the contraction of conformal sym-

metry. The analysis of [15] might be helpful for further study of this problem. The calculation

we present in this paper is another conﬁrmation for the Flat/CCFT proposal.

In section two we review the results of [2] and introduce the generators of BMS4 symmetry

at the spatial inﬁnity by proposing appropriate boundary conditions. In section three we propose

a stress tensor for the Kerr black hole by taking the limit of the Kerr-AdS case and observe

that its conserved charges have holographic description in terms of a ﬁeld theory that is given by

contraction of the CFT. The last section is devoted to the discussion and future directions.

1In the original proposal of [1] this correspondence was named BMS/GCA. However, in four dimensions the

symmetry algebra which is given by contraction of conformal algebra does not have Galilean subalgebra. Thus we

will call the ﬁeld theories which are dual of asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes contracted conformal ﬁeld theories.

2 BMS4 at Spatial inﬁnity

The BMS group also acts at spatial inﬁnity of the asymptotically ﬂat four dimensional spacetimes.

In order to ﬁnd the generators of this symmetry we start with the isometries of AdS4 in the global

coordinate

ds2 = −(cid:18)1 +

r2

ℓ2(cid:19) dt2 +

dr2

ℓ2(cid:17)
(cid:16)1 + r2

+ r2(cid:0)dθ2 + sin2 θdφ2(cid:1) ,

(2.1)

and take ℓ → ∞, which yields the Poincare symmetry. This limit has been taken in the appendix
B of [2]. The ﬁnal generators are

Ln =

¯Ln =

1

2 (cid:18)xy − 1
2 (cid:18)xy − 1

xy + 1 − n(cid:19) xn (t∂t − r∂r) − xn+1∂x,
xy + 1 − n(cid:19) yn (t∂t − r∂r) − yn+1∂y,

for m, n = −1, 0, 1 and

x = eiφ cot

θ

y = e−iφ cot

.

The generators (2.2) satisfy the following algebra,

[Lm, Ln] = (m − n)Lm+n,
[Ll, Mm,n] = (cid:18) l + 1

2 − m(cid:19) Mm+l,n,

[ ¯Lm, ¯Ln] = (m − n) ¯Lm+n,
[ ¯Ll, Mm,n] = (cid:18) l + 1

[Lm, ¯Ln] = 0,
2 − n(cid:19) Mm,n+l.

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

This algebra can be given an inﬁnite dimensional lift by deﬁning n, m and l as any integer. We

propose the generators (2.2) for any n and m as the generators of BMS4 symmetry at spatial

inﬁnity. We also introduce the appropriate boundary conditions which results in (2.2) as the

asymptotic symmetry of four dimensional Minkowski spacetimes.

In other words, we want to

forget the ﬂat-space limit and ﬁnd proper boundary functions which results in (2.4).To do so, we

start with four dimensional Minkowski spacetime and write it in the following way:

ds2 = g(0)

µν dxµdxν = −dt2 + dr2 +

4r2

(1 + xy)2 dxdy.

(2.5)

We deﬁne asymptotically ﬂat spcatimes at spatial inﬁnity by imposing boundary conditions

htt = O(1),
hrr = O(1),
hxx = O(1),

htr = 0,

htx = O(1),
hry = O(r),
hxy = O(1),

hrx = O(r),
hyy = O(1),
h = gµν(0)hµν = O(1/r).

hty = O(1),

(2.6)

The asymptotic Killing vector which preserve (2.6) is given by

ξ = [T (x, y) + tf (x, y)] ∂t − rf (x, y)∂r + X(x)∂x + Y (y)∂y,

where T (x, y), X(x) and Y (y) are arbitrary functions and

f (x, y) =

∂xX + ∂yY

xY + yX

1 + xy

Using (2.2), it is clear that

Ln = ξ(cid:0)T (x, y) = 0, X(x) = −xn+1, Y (y) = 0(cid:1) ,
¯Ln = ξ(cid:0)T (x, y) = 0, X(x) = 0, Y (y) = −yn+1(cid:1) ,
xmyn, X(x) = 0, Y (y) = 0(cid:19) .

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

The algebra (2.4) for m, n, l = −1, 0, 1 can be generated by contraction of conformal algebra
in three dimensions [17],[1],[2]. This is a good hint to ﬁnd the corresponding operation of ﬂat

space limit in the boundary side. We propose it as a contraction of three dimensional boundary

CFT. To make this proposal more concrete we should contract n-point functions of operators in

the boundary CFT. The simplest case is one point function of energy-momemntum tensor which

corresponds to the quasi local stress tensor of the bulk geometry. We expect that the ﬂat space

limit of the stress tensor in the bulk side corresponds to the contraction of one point function of

energy momentum tensor in the boundary theory. However, the ﬂat space limit in the boundary

side is not well-deﬁned in all cases and we should use lessons of contraction of the boundary theory.

In the next section we perform such a procedure for the simplest case which is Kerr black hole

in the bulk side. We write the metric of the Kerr black hole in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates
which yields spatial inﬁnity at r → ∞. Since BMS4 symmetry also acts at spatial inﬁnity, the
calculation of the next section make sense in the context of Flat/CCFT correspondence.

3 A quasi local stress tensor for the Kerr black hole

In this section we want to propose a quasi-local stress tensor for the Kerr black hole. We start

with the Kerr-AdS black hole which is given by

(3.3)

M is the mass of the black hole and a = J/M where J is the angular momentum of the black

hole. This black hole is asymptotically AdS with radius ℓ. The line element (3.1) is the solution

of the following theory:

S0 =

1

16πG Z d4x√−g(cid:18)R +

6

ℓ2(cid:19) .

(3.4)

We want to calculate the quasi-local stress tensor of the Kerr-AdS (3.1) by using Brown and York’s

method [14]. According to the dictionary of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the components of

this tensor correspond to the expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor of the boundary

CFT. According to [18]-[19], the quasi-local stress tensor is given by

T µν =

2

√−γ

δS
δγµν

,

(3.5)

where γµν = gµν − nµnν is the boundary metric and nµ is the outward pointing normal vector to
the boundary ∂M . S is given by

S = S0 −

1

8πG Z∂M

d3xK + Sct,

(3.6)

where K is extrinsic curvature of the boundary and Sct is added to remove divergent terms at
the boundary. One can check that for the Kerr-AdS metric written in the form (3.1), there is no

divergent term if Sct is chosen as

Sct = −

d3x√−γ(cid:18)1 −

ℓ2

R(3)(cid:19)

(3.7)

where R(3) is the Ricci scalar of γµν. Calculation of the quasi-local stress tensor for the Kerr-AdS,

Tij, has been done in papers [20]-[22] and the non-zero components (up to 1/r order) are given

by

(3.8)

One can use (3.8) and compute the conserved charges of Kerr-AdS black hole. This method was

introduced by Brown and York [14] which deﬁnes charge Qξ associated to symmetry generator ξ

as

Qξ = ZΣ

dσ√σvµξνTµν ,

(3.9)

6

where Σ is a t-constant surface in ∂M ,σab is metric of Σ and vµ is the unit timelike vector normal

to Σ. For the Kerr-AdS black hole given by (3.1), the metric of the boundary ∂M is given by

ds2 =

2a sin2 θ

Ξ

dtdφ +

ℓ2
∆θ

dθ2 +

ℓ2 sin2 θ

(3.10)

It is clear that (3.10) does not describe a R × S2 boundary. In order to change the metric of ∂M
to the standard form of the boundary of the global AdS we use of a coordinate transformation

This transformation yields,

φ = ϕ −

(3.11)

(3.12)

Tϕϕ is the same as Tφφ and the other components remain unchanged.

Now we want to use (3.8) and (3.12) in order to take the ﬂat-space limit to introduce a quasi
local stress tensor for the Kerr black hole. It is clear from (3.8) and (3.12) that for ℓ → ∞ some
of the components of the stress tensor are zero and some of them diverge. Therefore at ﬁrst

look, using this approach, while deﬁning ﬂat spacetime stress tensor by taking ﬂat space limit,

is not well-deﬁned. However, there is a proposal in [10] that tackles this problem and results in

well-deﬁned components for the stress tensor of the asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes. According to

[10] if one accepts the correspondence of the ﬂat space limit in the bulk as the contraction of the

CFT at the boundary, it is possible to use one point functions of the CCFT energy momentum

tensor.There also exists a method to ﬁnd a correct deﬁnition of ﬂat space stress tensor. This

method has been established in [10] for three dimensions. The ﬁnal result was interesting and

its extension to higher dimensions is plausible. The lessons of [10] show that in order to ﬁnd

the ﬂat space stress tensor from the AdS counterparts, one must apply proper powers of ℓ to

the components of the stress tensor, so that the ﬂat limit is well deﬁned. This factors must be
dimensionless, so we construct them in four dimensions by using ℓ/√G. Keeping this proposal in
mind and using (3.8) and (3.12) we introduce the Kerr black hole stress tensor, τij as

8πτtt =

8πτθθ =

8πτϕϕ =

sin2 θ.

We can use (3.13) and calculate conserved charges of Kerr black hole by using (3.9). However,

in this case the hypersurface ∂M is not the boundary and it is necessary that we determine this

hypersurface and its t-constant surface Σ carefully. We found (3.13) by taking limit and we also

expect to ﬁnd Σ by taking limit from the Kerr-AdS counterpart. The proposal has also been

established in [10] for the three dimensioanl asymptotically ﬂat solutions. We plan to use this

proposal for the current problem. The key point is if we assume the ﬂat space limit of the bulk

theory as a contraction of the boundary theory, the metric of spacetimes, which the boundary

theories lives on , are related before and after contraction. They are the same with a diﬀerence

that one of the coordinates of the spacetime, which contracted theory lives on, is contracted

coordinate of the original theory before contraction. To be precise, let us use (3.10) and try to

understand the role of ℓ in the deﬁnition of the conformal boundary. According to the AdS/CFT

correspondence, the conformal boundary is used for ﬁnding the spacetime in which the dual CFT

lives on . After applying coordinate change (3.11), the boundary metric (3.10) is written as

ds2 =

r2

G (cid:20)−(cid:18)1 +

a2 sin2 θ

Ξℓ2 (cid:19) G

ℓ2 dt2 +

G
∆θ

dθ2 +

G sin2 θ

Ξ

dϕ2(cid:21) ,

(3.14)

where we have used Newton constant G to make the conformal factor dimensionless. If we deﬁne
a new time ˜t as

√G
ℓ

t,

˜t =

(3.15)

(3.16)

the ﬂat limit, ℓ → ∞ is well-deﬁned and yields

r2

d˜s2 =

G (cid:2)−d˜t2 + Gdθ2 + G sin2 θdϕ2(cid:3) .

It is clear from (3.15) that ˜t only make sense for ﬁnite ℓ, but as ℓ → ∞ it is nothing other than the
contraction of time for the boundary theory. We assume that the dual theory of asymptotically

ﬂat spacetimes lives on a spacetime where its time is given by contraction of the time coordinate

of original CFT. In other words the dual of Kerr black hole must live on a spacetime with a metric
given by (3.16) and ˜t is the time coordinate of the Kerr. Returning ˜t to t and deﬁning ∂M in

(3.9) as (3.16), we can use (3.13) and calculate the conserved charges of Kerr black hole. It is not

diﬃcult to check that

Q∂ϕ = −aM,
are the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr black hole.

Q∂t = M,

(3.17)

4 Discussion

In this paper we checked the proposal of [10] in four dimensions. The main results of [10] are based

on the correspondence between asymptotically ﬂat space times and contracted CFTs. Thus, in

8

this view we started establishing a holographic picture for four dimensional asymptotically ﬂat

spacetimes. The main cavity for the generalizing method of [10] was that deﬁning four dimensional

asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes in the BMS gauge is not appropriate when one wants to use the

ﬂat-space limit technique. However, in this paper we argue that using another coordinates system

can solve this problem. As our ﬁrst example, we used the Kerr-AdS black hole written in the

Boyer-Lindquist coordinate. Using this coordinate and taking the ﬂat space limit requires the

dual boundary theory of Kerr to live on spatial inﬁnity rather than null inﬁnity. This requirement

necessitates an asymptotic symmetry group at spatial inﬁnity. We proposed that this symmetry

is still BMS symmetry and introduced the boundary condition and the symmetry generators.

The calculations of this paper are the ﬁrst step in this direction. The next step will be

generalizing this method for arbitrary asymptotically ﬂat spacetimes in four dimensions. The

boundary conditions, which these spacetimes must satisfy at spatial inﬁnity, were introduced in

this paper but the generic solution to the ﬁeld equations, which obey these boundary conditions,

must be explored. Using the generic solution one can calculate the charges of the asymptotic

killing vectors and see whether they are ﬁnite, conserved and integrable.
