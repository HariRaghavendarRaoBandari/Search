Abstrakt: Teorie funkcionálu hustoty je preferovaná mikroskopická metoda pro výpočet
vlastností jader napříč celou tabulkou nuklidů. Vedle vlastností základního stavu, které
se počítají Hartreeho-Fockovou metodou, vzbuzené stavy jader se dají popsat pomocí
metody Random Phase Approximation (RPA). Hlavním cílem předkládané práce je po-
dat formalismus RPA metody pro sféricky symetrická jádra, s použitím technik skládání
momentu hybnosti. Probírají se také různá pomocná témata, jako Hartreeho-Fockova
teorie, Coulombův integrál, těžišťové korekce a párování. Metoda RPA je odvozená
rovněž pro axiálně deformovaná jádra. Odvozené vzorce byly zabudovány do počí-
tačových programů a použity pro výpočet některých fyzikálních výsledků. Po zevrub-
ném prozkoumání výpočtů z hlediska numerické přesnosti byla probrána tyto témata:
toroidální povaha nízko-ležící části E1 rezonance („pygmy“), gigantické rezonance různé
multipolarity v deformovaném jádře 154Sm a magnetické dipólové (M1) přechody v de-
formovaném 50Cr.

Abstract: Density functional theory is a preferred microscopic method for calculation of
nuclear properties over the whole nuclear chart. Besides ground-state properties, which
are calculated by Hartree-Fock theory, nuclear excitations can be described by means
of Random Phase Approximation (RPA). The main objective of the present work is
to give the RPA formalism for spherically symmetric nuclei, using the techniques of
angular-momentum coupling. Various auxiliary topics, such as Hartree-Fock theory,
Coulomb integral, center-of-mass corrections and pairing, are treated as well. RPA
method is derived also for axially deformed nuclei. The derived formulae are then
implemented in the computer code and utilized for calculation of some physical results.
After thorough investigation of the precision aspects of the calculation, the following
topics are treated as examples: toroidal nature of the low-energy (pygmy) part of the
E1 resonance, giant resonances of various multipolarities in deformed nucleus 154Sm,
and magnetic dipole (M1) transitions in deformed 50Cr.

Keywords: Random Phase Approximation, Skyrme functional, giant resonances in nu-
clei, reduced matrix elements

1. Introduction

Microscopic quantum-theoretical description of nuclei (in terms of their ground-
state and excited-state properties, transition probabilities and nuclear reactions)
is a diﬃcult task, due to poor knowledge of the nuclear interaction (as compared
to electronic systems) and various other obstacles. Although the main features
of the nucleon-nucleon interaction can be deduced from the scattering data, their
straightforward application for a product wavefunction (Slater determinant) of
the Hartree-Fock method, which is numerically the simplest approach to a quan-
tum many-body problem, runs into the problem of strongly repulsive short-range
part of the N-N interaction. This obstacle can be circumvented by utilizing
renormalized in-medium interaction, thus giving rise to Brückner-Hartree-Fock
method [1]. However, such approach did not give satisfactory results, also due
to the need of three-body interactions, which are diﬃcult to measure. The BHF
method has currently attracted revived attention [2], due to the fact that its
relativistic version [3] does not need the three-body interaction.

An alternative approach is to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the full conﬁgu-
ration space of many-body wavefunctions, constructed from a given single-particle
basis, and the resulting method is called large-scale shell model [4]. Because the
numerical cost grows exponentially with the basis, the shell model either has
to use strongly truncated model space with phenomenological corrections to the
interaction (usable for A < 100), or restrict itself to very light nuclei (up to
12C), giving rise to ab-initio no-core shell model. The convergence and reach of
the no-core shell model can be somewhat improved either by softening of the
interaction (based on chiral forces) by similarity renormalization group [5], or by
group-theoretical preselection of the basis in the symmetry-adapted no-core shell
model [6].

Shell model is not suitable for heavier nuclei, which are therefore most often
treated by the density functionals. These were at ﬁrst inspired by the Brückner-
Hartree-Fock method, so they are mean-ﬁeld methods, based on a product wave-
function determined in an iterative way, but the interaction is phenomenological
and no longer derived from the bare N-N data. Energy density functional in
nuclear physics is then a self-consistent microscopic approach to calculate nu-
clear properties and structure over the whole periodic table (except the lightest
nuclei) [7]. The method is analogous to Kohn-Sham density functional theo-
ry (DFT) used in electronic systems. Three types of functionals are frequent-
ly used nowadays: non-relativistic Skyrme functional [8, 9, 10] with zero-range
two-body and density dependent interaction, ﬁnite-range Gogny force [11, 12]
and relativistic (covariant) mean-ﬁeld [13, 14, 15]. Typical approach employs
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov or HF+BCS calculation scheme to obtain ground state
and single-(quasi)particle wavefunctions and energies. These results are then
utilized to ﬁt the parameters of the functional to experimental data, thus ob-
taining various parametrizations suitable for speciﬁc aims, such as: calculation of
mass-table, charge radii, ﬁssion barriers, spin-orbit splitting and giant resonances.
Mean-ﬁeld calculation can be extended by taking a superposition of more Slater
determinants and by restoration of broken symmetries (particle number, angular
momentum), leading to the generator coordinate method, which is suitable for de-

2

scription of shape coexistence and low-energy excited states (including rotational)
[16, 17].

Random Phase Approximation (RPA) is a textbook standard [1] to calculate
one-phonon excitations of the nucleus, suitable also for the mean-ﬁeld functionals.
In practice, it is a method widely utilized for calculation of giant dipole resonances
and other strength functions (giant monopole, quadrupole and M1 spin-ﬂip reso-
nances). Increasing computing power has enabled to employ fully self-consistent
residual interaction derived from the same density functional as the underlying
ground state. While the spherical nuclei can be treated directly (by matrix di-
agonalization) [18, 19, 20], axially deformed nuclei still pose certain diﬃculties
due to large matrix dimensions [21, 22]. Our group developed a separable RPA
(SRPA) approach for Skyrme functional [23, 24], which greatly reduces the com-
putational cost for deformed nuclei by utilizing separable residual interaction,
entirely derived from the underlying functional by means of multi-dimensional
linear response theory.

Skyrme RPA is used in our group mainly in its separable form and assuming
the axial symmetry. Therefore, the primary aim of my work was a derivation
and implementation of RPA in the spherical symmetry. To clarify the remaining
issues, I developed also the full RPA in axial symmetry and a spherical Hartree-
Fock for closed-shell nuclei.

The present work gives a derivation of convenient formalism for rotationally-
invariant treatment of spherical Skyrme RPA (both full and separable). Both
time-even and time-odd terms of Skyrme functional are employed, so the method
is suitable for various electric and magnetic multipolarities. Then, the correspond-
ing computer codes were constructed. Programs sph_qrpa and sph_srpa take
wavefunctions from Reinhard’s haforpa, which is a grid-based Skyrme HF+BCS
code. Due to a restricted model space in haforpa (22–23 major shells), I wrote al-
so a Skyrme Hartree-Fock code (without pairing) based on the spherical-harmonic-
oscillator (SHO) basis, which allows to extend the model space to over 100 major
shells. Subsequent RPA then leads to almost complete elimination of the spurious
center-of-mass contribution in E1 transitions.

Detailed expressions for matrix elements, applicable to full RPA, were also
derived for axial symmetry. RPA code skyax_qrpa was written to deal with
wavefunctions of Reinhard’s skyax, a Skyrme HF+BCS code for deformed nuclei
working with a cylindrical coordinate grid. Due to large computational demands,
special care was taken to vectorize and parallelize the code, to make it suitable
for routine calculations on the available multi-processor workstations (with 12
CPU cores and more than 32 GB of RAM).

The new codes were ﬁrst tuned with respect to the basis parameters and the
size of the conﬁguration space, with the aim of consistent RPA results. Then,
full and separable RPA are compared to get a set of the most eﬃcient input
operators. Selected nuclear properties were then calculated and compared to the
experimental data, such as giant electric dipolar (E1) resonance (GDR) with its
low-energy “pygmy” part, isoscalar giant monopolar (E0) resonance (GMR), M1
and E2 strength functions in spherical and deformed nuclei. The importance of
spin and tensor terms of Skyrme functional is demonstrated for M1 and toroidal
E1 resonances. Since the strength functions are calculated in the long-wave ap-
proximation, a comparison with exact transition operator is presented as well.

3

Finally, a toroidal nature of the low-energy E1 (pygmy) transitions is demon-
strated, as was also published in our recent papers [25, 26].

The thesis is organized as follows. First, I give a detailed treatment of various

terms of the nuclear density functional in chapter 2 Theoretical formalism.

where the densities (ρ, τ) will be deﬁned in (2.11). Skyrme functional HSk, in-
cluding its implementation in RPA, is treated for spherical symmetry in section
2.2 and for axial symmetry in section 2.3.
Its derivation from the two-body
interaction is given in appendix A. Direct Coulomb interaction and numerical

2. Theoretical formalism

This chapter gives a detailed account of the calculation of Skyrme Hartree-Fock
and RPA (i.e., nuclear ground state and small-amplitude excitations) [1] by means
of single-particle (s.p.) wavefunctions decomposed by assuming rotational sym-
metry – either spherical or axial (cylindrical). Besides Skyrme functional, it was
necessary to treat also the Coulomb interaction, pairing interaction, transition
operators, and kinetic center-of-mass term [10]. The derived formulae were im-
plemented in the computer programs as mentioned in the introduction, with the
exception of Coulomb integral in cartesian coordinates, which is given only as
a kind-of toy-model. More speciﬁcally, the programs included: spherical closed-
shell HF in SHO basis, spherical full and separable RPA in SHO basis and on the
radial grid, and axial full RPA on the 2D grid – the results of these calculations
are given in chapters 3 and 4. Separable RPA, which is a numerically eﬃcient
method based on the linear response theory [23, 24], is treated only in appendix
C, to avoid unnecessary details in this chapter.

Since the primary aim was to derive the spherical RPA, the formalism given
below is optimized in this direction. Particular attention was given also to the
precise evaluation of the Coulomb integral by means of Euler-Maclaurin correc-
tions, and to the evaluation of kinetic center-of-mass term for HF and RPA. Both
of these topics seem to have little coverage in the literature on nuclear density
functionals.

Notation of Clebsh-Gordan coeﬃcients and most of the formulae used in the
derivation are taken from the book of Varshalovich [28]. Detailed derivation of
the utilized formulae can be found also in my notes about special functions in
quantum mechanics [29] (in Slovak).

Before coming to the theory itself, a few preliminary comments are given here
in order to clarify the further utilization of a bra-ket notation. When applying
single-particle expressions to a many-body system, it is necessary to distinguish
whether the bra-ket formulation of matrix elements is understood as in the anti-
symmetrized many-body system, described by the Slater determinants (or equiv-
alently by creation and annihilation operators; P is a permutation of indices)

In most cases below, the bra-ket notation is meant as (2.2), with the exception of
sections 2.2.4 Full RPA and 2.5 Pairing, where many-body Slater states (2.1) or
their linear combinations are used. Many-body matrix element is presumed also
in the following shortcut for commutators, which is evaluated in Hartree-Fock (or
HF+BCS) ground state:

2.1 Skyrme interaction and density functional
Skyrme interaction is a phenomenological approach to nuclear potential, which
includes spatial derivatives in addition to the local densities. Its deﬁnition usually
starts with a two-body density-dependent interaction [9]

Spin-orbital current Jjk and current ∇jsk have two indices, so they can be
interpreted as spherical tensor operators and then decomposed into scalar, vector
and (symmetric) rank-2 tensor part, using orthogonality of Clebsch-Gordan co-
eﬃcients, with components corresponding to angular quantum numbers 0, 1 and
2 (i.e., total number of components is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 32).

2.2 Skyrme RPA in the spherically symmetric

case

The complete treatment of various terms of Skyrme density functional, and the
residual interaction derived from it, is given below for spherical symmetry. Some
of these concepts are valid also for the axial symmetry, so the corresponding
section will be accordingly shorter.

2.2.1 Notation for one-body matrix elements
Spherical decomposition of a single-particle wavefunction (spin 1/2) is
2 ,ξYlαν(ϑ, ϕ) χξ

jαmα(ϑ, ϕ) = Rα(r)X

h~r|αi = ψα(~r) = Rα(r) Ωlα

C jα,mα
lα,ν, 1

νξ

(2.19)

with Ωlα
jαmα denoting spin-orbitals and χξ are spinors. Greek letters will be used
for labeling of single-particle and single-quasiparticle states and should not be
later confused with creation and annihilation operators for quasiparticles which
are always denoted by a hat (i.e. ˆαα, ˆα+
β ).

Time reversal of a nucleon wavefunction is deﬁned as
α(~r) = (−1)lα+jα+mαψ−α(~r),
ψ¯α(~r) = ˆT ψα(~r) = iσyψ∗

ˆT|¯αi = −|αi

where −α ≡ {nα, jα, lα,−mα}. Time-parity of an operator ˆA, denoted as γA
deﬁned by the relation

(2.20)
T , is

ˆT −1 ˆA ˆT = γA

T

T =

time-even

(2.21)

(cid:26) +1 :

Single-particle matrix elements then satisfy

h¯α| ˆA| ¯βi = h¯α| ˆA ˆT|βi = hα| ˆT −1 ˆA ˆT|βi∗ = γA
hα| ˆA| ¯βi = hα| ˆA ˆT|βi = −h¯α| ˆT −1 ˆA ˆT|βi∗ = −γA

(2.22a)
(2.22b)
To account for pairing (treated in more detail in section 2.5 Pairing interac-

tion), quasiparticles are introduced by Bogoliubov transformation [1, p. 234]

{ˆαα, ˆα+
{ˆαα, ˆαβ} = 0

(2.23)

with real positive coeﬃcients uβ, vβ satisfying u2
β = 1. States α, β, . . . are
obtained from Skyrme Hartree-Fock iteration, which is appended by a solution
of BCS equations to obtain uβ, vβ. The HF+BCS groud state of an even-even
nucleus is then a vacuum with respect to quasiparticle annihilation operators ˆαβ.
One-body operator can be expressed as

β + v2

ˆA =X

α ˆaβ =X

αδαβ

(cid:17)

(2.24)

In the RPA, the operators are evaluated only in the commutators in the ground
state, h[ ˆA, ˆB]i, and here, the non-zero contributions come only from ˆααˆαβ, ˆα+
α ˆα+
β .
So I will drop all other terms and symmetrize according to (2.22) to obtain

where the pairing factors were abbreviated as
αβ = uαvβ − vαuβ

αβ = uαvβ + vαuβ,
u

The sums are not restricted with respect to double counting, so the diagonal
matrix elements are treated correctly. Ordering of the pairs αβ with properly
included diagonal matrix elements will be discussed at (2.59).

Vector hermitian operators can be rewritten as tensor operators of rank 1

√
ˆA1 = (− ˆAx − i ˆAy)/

2,

ˆA0 = ˆAz,

√
ˆA−1 = ( ˆAx − i ˆAy)/
2

I therefore deﬁne hermiticity of the tensor operator by a condition

m = (−1)m ˆA−m
ˆA†

The same rule applies also to higher-rank tensor operators. Besides scalars and
vectors, I will use rank-2 tensors (denoted by boldface, A). When the rank is not
speciﬁed, I will use upright bold symbols (A). By the term “rank”, I refer to the
“spin” part of an operator (i.e., to its multi-component nature; but its meaning
is closer to a photon spin, and not a nucleon spin).

Since the density and current operators depend on position, their angular
part will be decomposed by orbital angular momentum (L) and total angular

momentum (J or λ) in terms of scalar (YLM), vector (~Y L
spherical harmonics, whose decomposition in terms of Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients

When ˆA is a tensor operator with multipolarity λ, µ, then, according to
Wigner-Eckart theorem, I can factorize a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient from hα| ˆA|βi,
and obtain a reduced matrix element, which will be denoted by Aαβ (including
the pairing factor), instead of bra-ket, not to cause confusion in many-body quasi-
particle formalism.

The formalism of reduced matrix elements needs to be generalized to density
and current operators (2.12), which are position-dependent, in contrast with usual
tensor operators (2.31). The outcome will be ﬁrst demonstrated for ordinary
density, by using (7.2.40) in [28]:

As can be seen, besides Clebsh-Gordan coeﬃcient and numerical factors, there
is a radial-dependent function and the complex-conjugated spherical harmonics
(appearance of Y ∗ can be understood as coming from the multipolar decom-
position of the delta function to δ(r)Y (ˆr)Y ∗(ˆr)).
In the generalization of the
Wigner-Eckart theorem (2.31), I will absorb the radial dependence into the re-
duced matrix element, which will be denoted like ρL
αβ(r). In general (see appendix
B), the multipolar expansion of the density and current operators, ˆJd(~r) (2.12),
contains spherical harmonics in its scalar, vector or tensor form: YL∗

2.2.2 Reduced matrix elements of densities and currents
To simplify the expressions for reduced matrix elements, it is convenient to absorb

certain numerical factors to the radial wavefunctions, e.g. factorq(2j + 1)(2l + 1)

in ordinary density (2.34). Other densities and currents will employ also deriva-
tive operators and the following shorthand notation of radial wavefunctions turns
out to be convenient

(2jα + 1)(2lα + 1) Rα(r)

An example of the derivation of vector spin-orbital current J JL
αβ (r) is given
in appendix B, which illustrates main steps involved in the remaining densi-
ties/currents.
Precise diﬀerentiation of the wavefunctions in (2.38), which are deﬁned on an
equidistant grid (with spacing ∆, going from −n∆ to n∆), is achieved through
their discrete Fourier transformation.

In practice, the convolution matrix (in large parentheses) is calculated in advance
for two cases, even and odd R(r), and then applied to functions Rα(r). Alterna-
tively, expressions (2.38) can be calculated analytically, if the radial wavefunctions
are expressed in the basis of spherical harmonic oscillator (see later (2.49)).

simply related to ~j and J (2.12) and diﬀer only in the relative sign and the

even nuclei only in their monopole component (J = 0) and for time-even case.
They can be calculated from the reduced matrix elements of the previous section,
re-evaluating (2.35), assuming ja = jb = j, la = lb = l, ma = mb = −mβ, or,

in the coupling of orbital and spin angular momentum). Index (HF) and latin

Skyrme HF calculation then proceeds by a straightforward iterative way:
1. HF wavefunctions Rα(r) are evaluated on the radial grid from the orthogo-
(j,l)
aα in each subspace of j and l (index a is essentially equiv-

nal matrices U
alent to ν in spherical-harmonic-oscillator basis).

2. Ground state densities are calculated from Rα(r), taking into acount pair-
ing factors v2
α (given by the separate BCS step, or taken as 0/1 according
to occupancy). Densities from the previous iteration are admixed to the
new densities (by 50%) to stabilize the convergence. Coulomb potential is
calculated by folding with 1/|~r1 − ~r2| according to section 2.4.1. The total
energy can be calculated here as well.

3. Matrix elements of single-particle HF Hamiltonian are calculated by radi-
al integration of a product of the ground-state densities and the matrix
elements of densities (2.46) in SHO basis. Kinetic term (2.50) is shown
separately from H in the formula below. Moreover, it is possible to in-
clude center-of-mass correction for the kinetic energy (see section 2.6), if
correction-before-variation is needed – this option requires also the calcu-
(j,l)
bα , which is (2j + 1)-times
lation of density matrix D
degenerated in quantum number m.

The iterations are repeated until the relative diﬀerence in the total energy be-
comes lower than 10−14 (it takes from 50 iteration for Ca up to 90 iterations for
Pb). Then, four iterations are done without admixing previous densities.

where the index 2qp means that I take only the two-quasiparticle portion of
the commutator (after normal ordering). Although all commutators should be
evaluated in the RPA ground state, I evaluate them in the HF+BCS ground state
(i.e., I am using quasi-boson approximation), which is a common practice, as the
contribution of 4qp and higher correlations in the ground state to the expectation
value of commutators is assumed to be low [1].

The Hamiltonian is taken as a sum of mean-ﬁeld part (HF+BCS) and the

second functional derivative of the energy density functional (1.1).

Quantity k is not a constant:
it depends on the particular transition, and also
changes sign under hermitian conjugation. For this reason, the electric operators
containing an odd power of k (including jλ(kr)) are time-even, despite the time-
odd nature of the current ˆ~jnuc (please notice that ˆM E
tor;λµ in our deﬁnition is
(strictly speaking) time-odd and non-hermitian, because it was stripped of k).

The constant involved in magnetic and toroidal/compression transition oper-

ators is

and the elementary charge e (as a symbolical parameter without a speciﬁc unit
system) is usually excluded from the numerical evaluation. Then the matrix
element is said to be in units [e.fmλ] (or [e.fmλ+1] for ˆM E
vtc;λµ, or [e.fmλ+2] for
ˆM E 0
com;λµ). Magnetic transitions are often enumerated excluding the whole µN /c
factor, and are then reported as being in units [µN .fmλ−1] (because µN /c in SI
units is equivalent to µN in cgs units).

Gamma absorption cross section is related to the transition probability

where the Lorentz function

accounts for a ﬁnite half-life, but in practice, other eﬀects are included by choos-
ing a larger width ∆ (such as ﬁnite experimental energy resolution, inability to
calculate fragmentation of the states due to complex conﬁgurations etc.). The
observed absorption cross-section is mostly dominated by long-wave isovector E1

transitions, so the larger multipolarities (and also monopole and isoscalar transi-
tions) can be measured only indirectly, for example by electron or alpha scatter-
ing. The individual states are usually not distinguishable, and the distribution
of the transition probability is depicted by means of a strength function

Center-of-mass correction essentially integrates and removes the contribution of

It is not necessary to apply these corrections, if the spurious mode is suﬃciently
well separated (e.g. by employing a large SHO basis), but then the spurious state
has to be excluded from the calculation of the strength function.

The accuracy of the calculation for electric transitions can be checked by
evaluation of the energy-weighted sum rule m1 (EWSR), which relates certain

2.3 Skyrme RPA in the axially deformed case
Full RPA was derived also for the axial symmetry, and the corresponding formal-
ism is given below. Some of the concepts are similar to the spherical case (such
as pairing factors, transition operators), so the reader is referred to the previous
sections.

Cylindrical coordinates are

 =

x2 + y2, z, ϕ = arctg y
x

;

x =  cos ϕ, y =  sin ϕ

(2.91)

Calculations in axially deformed nuclei don’t conserve total angular momentum,
nevertheless, they conserve its z-projection and parity, so it is convenient to pre-
serve part of the formalism from the spherical symmetry, namely the convention
of m-components in vector and tensor operators, and the rule (2.28) for their
hermitian conjugation:

Removal of the duplicate 2qp pairs (such as (2.59) in the spherical case) is
done by omitting states α with mα < 0, but including pairs α ¯β with mα+mβ = µ
and α > β in some ordering (and with omission of the Pauli-violating case α¯α).
The equivalent duplicates are then αβ ↔ ¯β ¯α and α ¯β ↔ β ¯α. The case µ = 0

the RPA equations anyway): αβ, ¯β ¯α, βα, ¯α ¯β.

2.4 Coulomb integral
In the following text, I will analyze the correct way of integration for direct two-
body Coulomb interaction. The discussion deals also with accuracy of numerical
integration in general, which is an important aspect of nuclear calculations, due to
the rapid increase of computational cost in reduced symmetry (axial and triaxial
nuclei). No further physical questions are treated in this section.

The calculation of Coulomb potential involves a problem of integrable singu-
larity (1/r) during the evaluation of discretized integrals in axial and cartesian
coordinates. Even the spherical case contains a kink for r1 = r2, which prevents
from the accurate application of Gaussian quadrature. One possible solution em-
ploys Talmi-Moshinski transformation to center-of-mass coordinates [37], which
shifts the singularity to r = 0, where it can be integrated easily (it is cancelled
by r2 in spherical Jacobian). However, this method is not suitable for DFT, since
the calculation of coeﬃcients becomes unfeasible for higher shells (N ≥ 12).

It turns out that Gaussian quadrature is not necessary, and very precise results
can be obtained also with equidistant lattice, as follows from Euler-Maclaurin
summation formula for a smooth function f(x) [38]

The Euler-Maclaurin formula (further abbreviated as E-M) is an asymptotic se-
ries, which doesn’t have to converge, and its error is similar to the last included
term (which is usually small, since the growth begins only in high-order terms,
which are diﬃcult to calculate anyway). When the integration grid is suﬃcient-
ly large, the harmonic oscillator wavefunction (including its derivatives) on the
boundaries is negligible, so the error of integration by simple summation rapid-
ly vanishes, provided the oscillation wavelength λ is suﬃciently larger than grid
spacing ∆. Nyquist limit is λ < 2∆, while the double precision accuracy can be

reached already with λ < 4∆ for harmonic oscillator basis. However, due to un-
certainities arising from numerical diﬀerentiation and its use in E-M corrections
in Coulomb integral (2.119), it is advisable to shift the limit to λ < 6∆ in HF and
λ < 8∆ in RPA. Together with the appropriate integration boundary, it gives

mω is the oscillator length and N = 2νmax + l is the number of major
shells. These choices correspond to 2.5N integration points in HF for spherical
symmetry, or 3.3N in RPA.

In fact, the methods like Simpson and Romberg integration take advantage
of cancellation of the boundary terms in (2.108) by admixing sums with larger
spacing (2∆, 4∆, etc.). Such approach is not suitable here, due to oscillatory
character of the wavefunctions, which make the wider-spaced sums incorrect. It
is much better to include E-M corrections directly, if needed.

The value of the integrand is then ﬁnite for all r1, r2, and has a kink in r1 = r2.
To get an acceptable accuracy of the result, evaluation of the Coulomb integral
on equidistant grid needs a correction in r1 = r2 coming from Euler-Maclaurin
(E-M) series (2.108). Let’s suppose that the grid spacing is ∆ and the kink is
located at r = n∆. Then, E-M series has the form:

There is no correction in r1 = 0 or r2 = 0 due to the presence of only even powers

obtain an eﬀective value of f0 = f(0, 0, 0) to be plugged into sum (2.121) instead
of the inﬁnite value.

be approximated by Taylor expansion, where only even terms contribute to the

As can be seen, taking higher orders of E-M corrections does not increase the order
of integral convergence due to a divergent nature of the integrand. Nevertheless,
the accurate value of needed coeﬃcients can be obtained by empirical evaluation
of the convergence of Coulomb integral for various charge distributions. Such
approach gives

and the Coulomb integral then converges as O(∆8) – assuming that the charge
density vanishes near the integration boundary, or the E-M corrections up to
third order are included there.

Since the calculation of Coulomb potential is a convolution, it would be natural
to apply Fourier transformation during the process. Convolution with 1/r is then
replaced by a multiplication of the frequency domain by 4π/k2 (derived by taking
the limit µ → 0 in e−µr/r, whose Fourier transformation is 4π/(µ2 + k2)). Again,

Convolution array obtained by this method should include derivative corrections
to all orders, as compared to (2.132), which includes only up to fourth deriva-
tive. However, this method of Fourier-like array is probably not usable due to
computational cost of calculating all N 3 coeﬃcients, which have to be calculat-
ed accurately, and their integration time grows rapidly for large n. At least it
provides a comparison with the convolution coeﬃcients obtained by the previous
methods, see Table 2.2.

One can also use Fourier method directly: by appling direct and then inverse
fast Fourier transformation (FFT) to the density, which should reduce compu-
tational cost from O(N 6) to O((N log N)3). However, there is a problem of the
potential leaking from the periodic boundary (due to discretized momentum),
and inability to apply the corrections beyond the ﬁrst term in (2.134). Both diﬃ-
culties may be solved by placing proper compensating charges on the boundary of
the coordinate grid (e.g., employing a multipolar expansion of the nuclear charge
distribution, where the main contribution comes from the ﬁrst few terms [39]).

As can be seen, the reformulation of integral (2.135) did not remove the singular-
ity in 1 = 2, z1 = z2, and the result of integration remains ﬁnite only due to the
ﬁnite number of integration points of the subsequent Gauss-Legendre quadrature
(e.g. 20-point quadrature gives around two-fold overestimation). A correct re-
moval of this singularity (i.e., its analytical integration) has to take into account
the value of a ﬁnite grid spacing ∆, as was demonstrated in the previous section
for cartesian coordinates (and will be done also for axial case later in this section,
see (2.150)).

However, the representation (2.142) enables to precisely evaluate the Coulomb
integral in certain circumstances. Namely, by assuming a ﬁnite charge distribu-

tion of proton, here taken asqhr2i = 0.87 fm (which is larger than the usual grid

spacing 0.4–0.7 fm). I will assume Gaussian distribution in the following treat-
ment, instead of usually employed exponential distribution, since the physical
properties should not depend very much on the type of the distribution [42].

It has to be noted that Skyrme functionals were usually ﬁtted assuming point-
like charges, and also Hartree-Fock calculation is done this way. So the usage of
smeared charge in RPA can be considered as a violation of self-consistency, and is
therefore disabled in the presented calculations (its usage almost doesn’t change
the results, only a slight downshift (ca. 0.1 MeV) of spurious state is observed).
Finally, it is also possible to employ empirical procedure similar to (2.132),

which gives the following replacement of the divergent point in (2.137):

where ∆ = dz = d. For the point on the axis (z1 = z2 and 1 = 2 = 0,
assuming m = 0, otherwise the contribution is zero), the ﬁrst term in (2.136) is
replaced as

(2.151)
For all other points, the integral in the function gm(x) (2.138) can be calculated
by a simple summation on equidistant points, which converges rapidly (due to
periodicity); or by Taylor series (2.139) for small x and m > 0, where the direct
integration runs into numerical problems (subtraction of large numbers to get
a small number).
It is also advisable to use extended precision (long double)
internally during the calculation of gm(x), to get an accurate result in double
precision.

2.5 Pairing interaction
Short-range part of the nuclear interaction gives rise to a superﬂuid phase tran-
sition in open-shell nuclei. This interaction gives rise to even-odd staggering of
the nuclear masses and separation energies, and is therefore denoted as pairing.
Pairing was implemented on the BCS level, so that the HF+BCS ground state is

|BCSi =

(uβ + vβˆa+

β ˆa+

¯β )|0i,

where u2

β + v2

β = 1.

Since Skyrme interaction is assumed only in the ph channel, pairing interaction
is added separately and acts only in the pp channel, either as a “volume pairing”
( ˆVpair) or as a “surface pairing” ( ˆV 0
pair):

In the pairing channel, the wavefunctions are coupled to pairs (αβ) and (γδ), and
the δ-interaction doesn’t depend on spin, so it useful to decompose the spin part
of the 2-body wavefunction to triplet and singlet. The matrix element can be
then decomposed schematically as

state (2.152).

In fact, δ-interaction gives rise to a diverging pairing energy. This problem
can be circumvented by using ﬁnite-range pairing interaction, as is done in Gogny
force, or by applying a cutoﬀ weight fβ to the pairing density, as is usually done
for Skyrme [43]:

(usually in the range of 5-9 MeV) is adjusted during the HF+BCS iterations,
according to the actual level density, to yield

SLy6.

2.6 Center-of-mass correction of the kinetic en-

ergy

Many-body wavefunction in the form of Slater determinant does not guarantee
that the center of mass is ﬁxed in the center of coordinates. In fact, it has certain
distribution around the center, and the expectation value of linear momentum
is ﬂuctuating as well. In this way the main-ﬁeld theory breaks the translational
symmetry, which can be approximately restored by subtraction of the center-of-
mass kinetic energy from the total ground-state energy [10].

The ﬁrst term in (2.170) is similar to single-particle kinetic energy and can be
included by rescaling of the nucleon mass (before or after variation). The second
term looks like a two-body interaction, for which the direct term is zero in spher-
ical symmetry (operator ˆp shifts the angular momentum l by ±1 and changes the
parity), and only the exchange term contributes.

where the 1/4 in the ﬁrst line is due to summation over positive and negative m,
the exchange term is absorbed to the direct term by

ψ ¯β(~r1)ψβ(~r2) = −ψ−β(~r1)ψ−β(~r2),

and the summation in (2.180) doesn’t run over m, as it was already included like
in (2.173).
It is possible also to include Hc.m. in the residual interaction of RPA, which
seems necessary for the self-consistency, when starting with a ground state cal-
culated in variation-after-projection (VAP) approach. RPA already restores the
symmetry to a certain degree, mainly limited by the size of the model space,
and it can be expected that the includion of Hc.m. will make the separation of
the spurious motion even better. The derivation of the residual interaction from
the two-body part of Hc.m. is a bit cumbersome, as it requires to take into ac-
count both direct and exchange terms, which in the spherical symmetry require
recoupling of the angular momenta.

The exchange kinetic c.m. term was not implemented in axial HF nor in SRPA
(which would be too much complicated). However, in both cases the direct term
can be included alone in E1, providing somewhat similar eﬀect to full approach

3. Numerical codes

The following computer programs dealing with Skyrme functional were developed
and utilized in the calculations:

• spherical HF in SHO basis (sph_hf) – applicable only for closed-shell nuclei.

The main parameters are oscillator length b =q/mω (2.48) and the basis

size – as a number of SHO major shells NHF (understood as N = 2νmax + l,
where ν is the radial quantum number).

• spherical full RPA (sph_qrpa) in SHO basis or with wavefunctions given on
equidistant grid (provided by HF+BCS in Reinhard’s haforpa). The main
input parameters are the multipolarity and parity of the transition (and
corresponding transition operator), and the number of major shells NRPA
(with the lowest energy) passed from HF to RPA.

• spherical separable RPA (sph_srpa) – same as before, but taking also the
input operators, which induce the separable form of the residual interaction.
• axial full RPA (skyax_qrpa), taking the single-particle HF+BCS basis from
axial Hartree-Fock (skyax_hfb, provided by Paul-Gerhard Reinhard). Sep-
arable axial RPA (skyax_me and sky_srpa) was provided by Wolfgang
Kleinig. These programs will be utilized only in the next chapter. They
were used with a ﬁxed grid spacing of 0.4 fm (the smallest allowed value).
This chapter will give an analysis of various factors inﬂuencing the accuracy
of calculation in the spherical symmetry for SHO and grid-based codes. These
calculations were done on 2.5 GHz Intel i5 (Sandy Bridge) processor using single
thread (with vectorization in the matrix algorithms), for which the computation
times are given.
Most of the calculations below were done with SLy7 parametrization [31] of
Skyrme functional, which contains both J 2 (tensor) term and center-of-mass
correction. The mass of proton and neutron are taken as equal with 2/2m =
20.73553 MeV.fm2. Calculations with large spherical-harmonic-oscillator (SHO)
basis were done for double-magic nuclei, due to absence of pairing in my Skyrme
HF program. Parametrization SGII [30], which includes J 2 term (and no c.m.c.;
2/2m = 20.7525 MeV.fm2), was used for some calculations of magnetic tran-
sitions, because it was ﬁtted on Gamow-Teller transitions (therefore, a better
agreement with experiments on M1 is expected).

Strength functions S0(E) (2.82) will be given only for one component λµ, so
the results should be multiplied with 2λ + 1 to get the total strength, except the
plots of σγ(E1) (2.80) which already have the correct scaling.

3.1 Eﬀects of the basis parameters
As will be shown below, utilization of the SHO basis has certain advantages.
First, it allows to employ approximate restoration of the translational symmetry
in HF by subtraction of the center-of-mass kinetic energy before variation (section
2.6) at almost no cost. Second, it allows to push E1 spurious state to almost zero

energy and reduce the amount of center-of-mass contribution to the time-even
transition density of the remaining states. This section gives an analysis with the
aim of proper choice of parameters of the basis, and its relation to the kinetic
center-of-mass correction and to the separation of E1 spurious mode (i.e., the
translational motion of the nucleus as a whole).

The center-of-mass correction in Hartree-Fock can be applied either after diag-
onalization, to get corrected total energy only (variation before projection, VBP),
or already in the HF Hamiltonian (variation after projection, VAP). Comparison
of both approaches is shown in Table 3.1, giving important contributions to the
total energy. As can be seen, the eﬀect of VBP/VAP on the total energy is below
0.1 MeV and decreases for heavier nuclei. For further RPA calculations, when
Hc.m. is not explicitly mentioned, I will use HF VBP approach with no Hc.m. in
RPA residual interaction.

The calculation with the SHO basis has one free parameter – oscillator length
b (2.48) – which takes the role of grid size from grid-based HF solvers. As a ﬁrst
estimate of b, I looked for the value which minimizes the ground state energy for
the given basis size (Table 3.2, Fig. 3.1). To exclude any possible bias due to a
discrete integration grid, I employed the following integration parameters instead
of (2.110):

rmax = 1.4b

∆grid = 0.05 fm,

(3.1)
The ground state energy is converging rapidly with increasing basis. The upshift
of the energy minimum in comparison to NHF = 120 was from 1 keV (Ca) to 15
keV (Pb) for NHF = 30, from 0.05 keV (Ca) to 2 keV (Pb) for NHF = 40, and
from 2 meV (Ca) to 60 meV (Pb) for NHF = 100. Although such a large basis
is certainly not needed for the evaluation of the ground-state energy, it becomes
important in subsequent RPA step, where it helps to separate center-of-mass

MeV / major shell for calcium and 5 MeV / major shell for 208Pb).

In further calculations, parameter b is chosen close to the minimum in energy
at N = 120, and the number of major shells is chosen separately for protons and
neutrons in order to minimize the oscillations on the logarithmic plot of ground-
state proton and neutron densities (Fig. 3.2), and for the linear part of log10 ρ
to reach certain reasonable level (-18 for Ca, -15.5 for Pb). It was found that
this criterion leads also to consistent RPA results, i.e., that the strength function
doesn’t depend much on the number of major shells passed to RPA (assuming
NRPA ≥ 40). This fact is demonstrated for 40Ca in Fig. 3.2 where the deviations
in RPA results are found for the cases of b shifted by ±0.1 fm. As can be seen,
the converged shape of the strength function depends somewhat on b – this eﬀect

* Collective state, which has not yet the second lowest energy due to a small basis.

is probably a consequence of particular discretization of the continuum (i.e., the
nodal structure of the wavefunctions). The dependence of shape and convergence
of the strength function on b is not so pronounced for heavier nuclei. The choice
of b and NHF (see Table 3.3) deduced in this way for 40,48Ca and 208Pb will be
used also in the following sections.

Table 3.3 gives the results of long-wave isoscalar electric dipole RPA calcu-
lation (zp = zn = 1) for the nuclei 40, 48Ca and 208Pb, where the whole strength
should be accumulated in the spurious state close to zero energy. Hc.m. was ei-
ther included (VAP) or not included (VBP) in the self-consistent interaction.
The calculation time is very similar for VBP and VAP, when using SHO basis.
It was found that the good separation of the spurious state in E1 in the more
physically appropriate choice of HF VAP and RPA with Hc.m. can be achieved
also by using HF VBP and E1 RPA including only the direct term Hdir
c.m. (2.189)
– this approach is suitable for SRPA (where the full Hc.m. is very cumbersome
to apply) and for axial nuclei (there, its application was not found to be much
beneﬁcial, apparently due to low precision of the HF results). However, such a
trick doesn’t oﬀer much advantage (besides shifting Espurious closer to zero) over a
simple elimination of the E1 spurious contribution by the proper eﬀective charges

47

c.m. approach.

(zp = N/A, zn = −Z/A) or by the cmc term in E1 tor/com operators (2.84).

Hdir
c.m. was also used for the grid-based calculation starting with haforpa (given
under VAP column in table 3.3), because there the rigorous HF VAP approach
leads to a crash of the full RPA calculation for calcium, while 208Pb succeeds only
with a smaller basis (20+21 major shells), and then the results are even slightly
worse than with a simple HF VBP + Hdir

Table 3.3 shows also a signiﬁcant decrease of the energy of the ﬁrst E1 state
(after the spurious one), which has isoscalar character, with the increasing basis.
Low-lying states are an important component of the so-called pygmy resonance
[47], although in the case of lead, the most of strength is concentrated in the
second lowest state, whose downshift is not so dramatic (going as 7.913, 7.798,
7.697, 7.641, 7.637, 7.636 for VAP approach with NRPA = 20−120; or as 7.901,
7.788, 7.691, 7.636, 7.633, 7.633 for VBP approach). Accurate determination of
the energy of low-lying pygmy mode is probably guaranteed only with continu-
um RPA [48] (although still on the one-phonon level, which underestimates the
fragmentation).
The inﬂuence of the kinetic center-of-mass term Hc.m. (only direct term was
used in the grid-based calculation) and the cmc correction in the transition opera-
tors (2.83) is depicted in ﬁg. 3.3 for E1 transitions. Smaller basis (NRPA = 40) was
used to demonstrate the eﬀect. Eﬀective charges were zp = N/A, zn = −Z/A for
long-wave E1 and zp = zn = 0.5, gp = gn = 0.88 × 0.7 for toroidal/compression
E1.
It is clear that VAP approach has certain inﬂuence on the overall shape

of the strength function, but it doesn’t seem to be very important (Fig. 3.3a-
c). Term Hc.m. in RPA has one interesting property: It removes the isoscalar
center-of-mass strength in the transition operators with time-even densities (see
the exhaustion of EWSR by spurious state in Table 3.3), but doesn’t have such
eﬀect on the time-odd current.
In fact, the strength of the spurious state for
toroidal/compression transition is almost 100-times larger than for VBP (with
no Hc.m. in RPA), and the same behavior is found for VBP+Hdir
c.m. (so the “cmc”
in transition operator must be included in such cases). The reason can be traced
acquire a sign opposite to
down to the structure coeﬃcients: coeﬃcients c(ν+)
, so only the time-even quantities are reduced. When Hc.m. is omitted (VBP
c(ν−)
have the same sign, and the opposite
approach), the coeﬃcients c(ν+)
eﬀect is observed: spurious time-odd strength is reduced as ∼ 1/E, while the
time-even strength keeps the sum-rule. Again, disappearance of the isoscalar E1
EWSR contribution of the spurious state with VAP can be related to cancellation
of the mass constant (coming from the double commutator of kinetic term and
rY1µ) by Hc.m., which was not included in the ground-state EWSR estimate, so
the total relative EWSR of E1 RPA states goes down to 0% in Table 3.3.

Finally, a comparison of the calculation times for particular RPA procedures is
given in table 3.4. Calculation of the matrix elements scales like O(N 2). Matrix
algorithms scale like O(N 3) and consist of the following steps: square root of
the matrix P (2.65), matrix multiplication to calculate C T QC (2.67) and its
diagonalization in two steps – Householder transformation (bringing the matrix
to tri-diagonal form) and Householder-like iterations (gradually decreasing the oﬀ-
diagonal elements) – and ﬁnally, the conversion of eigenvectors ~Rν to structure
constants c(ν±)

Inﬂuence of tensor and spin terms

3.2
Full Skyrme functional (2.9) contains also the time-odd terms which are not
active in the calculation of the ground state of an even-even nucleus. Especially
the spin terms (˜b0, ˜b0
3) are diﬃcult to estimate experimentally, since
they are not coupled to other time-even terms by Galilean invariance [49]. We
can ﬁx these terms by a condition that the functional is fully equivalent to the
density-dependent two-body interaction (2.7). For this reason, the present work
is restricted mainly to parametrizations, which include the J 2 (tensor) term

0, ˜b2, ˜b0

2, ˜b3, ˜b0

49

(parameters ˜b1, ˜b0
1, containing both time-even and time-odd parts) – SLy7 [31]
and SGII [30] – and which don’t apply tweaking of the individual parameters, as
is done for b0
4 in SkI3 and SkI4 [50], although the tweaked functionals sometimes
better describe the M1 resonance [51, 52].

Figure 3.4: Strength functions for E1, toroidal E1 (with natural charges and cmc)
and M1 transitions in 48Ca and 208Pb, giving also the cases with omitted spin or
tensor terms in the residual interaction, and the experimental data for 48Ca M1
[53] and 208Pb M1 [54]

The importance of spin and tensor terms is demonstrated in Fig. 3.4, which
shows the calculations with omitted spin or tensor terms. In electric dipole tran-
sitions, the impact is clearly visible only in the higher order term, represented
here by toroidal strength function, calculated with natural charges. Unfortunate-
ly, this quantity (being mostly isovector) is probably not measurable. However,
magnetic dipole transitions are experimentally accessible, and conﬁrm the neces-
sity of inclusion of the spin terms, as was also found previously [35]. With regard
to accuracy of M1 for the given parametrizations, SLy7 appears to provide slightly
better agreement with experiment, although the second peak in 208Pb is beyond
the experimental range [54]. On the other hand, the ﬁrst peak according to SGII
may be identiﬁed with the 1+ state at 5.8445 MeV, having isoscalar nature with
B(M1)↑ = 1.0(4) µ2
N [55], which is however too weak to explain the calculated
B(M1)↑ = 5.7 µ2
N. Tensor term was found to have a minor inﬂuence in all cases.

The transition probabilities and strength functions are usually evaluated with
long-wave versions of the transition operators (2.72). It is therefore instructive
to give a comparison to the results obtained with the exact transition operators
(2.76), which can be calculated easily in the case of full RPA.

Figure 3.5: Comparison of electric dipole strength functions for 40,48Ca and
208Pb obtained with usual long-wave and exact transition operators (with natural
charges). The overall strength of the exact s.f. is found to be uniformly reduced
due to usage of the bare mass.

As can be seen in Fig. 3.5 (calculated here with inclusion of the kinetic center-
of-mass term), “exact” strength function has signiﬁcanly reduced amplitude (1.4-
times). This fact can be explained by the inadequate use of bare mass in the
nuclear current (2.73). Eﬀective mass is smaller, but only in isovector transi-
tions, as was mentioned also in the explanation of EWSR (2.87), and can be
demonstrated for E1 compression transitions. These can be calculated either by
current-based transition operator ˆMcom or by the density-based ˆMcom0, which are
related by the continuity equation. Isoscalar transition (zp = zn = 1) shows nearly
equal results for both choices, while isovector transition (zp = N/A, zn = −Z/A)
gives reduced strength for current-based operator.

Comparison with exact operators is also done for M1 and E2 transitions of
208Pb in Fig. 3.7. Quadrupole resonance was calculated with the natural charges
(zp = 1, zn = 0), so the resulting strength function is a superposition of both
isoscalar and isovector component.

tion of the ﬁrst two 2+ states [56] and the centroid and width of isoscalar giant

A closer look on the presented results also shows that the eﬀective mass is not
a constant, but depends on multipolarity and also on energy (except long-wave
E1). This point was not further studied here, and the remaining sections present
only the results involving long-wave or toroidal/compression operators.

3.4 Full RPA versus SRPA
Faster calculation of the strength function can be achieved through separable RPA
[23, 24], whose spherical formulation is described in appendix C, and the main
features will be summarized also here. SRPA requires a set of input operators
which provide generating ﬁelds for nuclear excitation, and the resulting responses
are giving rise to a separable form of the residual interaction. The accuracy
of the separable interaction is proportional to the number of input operators,
which have to be chosen by a clever way to cover the most important aspects of
the full interaction. The following time-even operators were utilized for electric
transitions:

ˆQ2 =
d3r ˆρ(~r) rλYλµ,
d3r ˆρ(~r) jλ(0.9xλr/rdiﬀ),

d3r ˆρ(~r) rλ+2Yλµ,

The operators were used in consecutive order, so, e.g., the 2-operator SRPA means
that ˆQ1 and ˆQ2 were used. Accurate description of toroidal transitions required
also additional operators containing spin

Separate operators were used for protons and neutrons. Moreover, another

time-conjugate operators were created as

ˆPk = i[ ˆH, ˆQk]

or

ˆQk = i[ ˆH, ˆPk]

(3.5)

so the total number of input operators and the dimension of separable interaction
is 4-times larger than the numbers given here.

Figure 3.8 shows the results for electric dipole strength functions. Toroidal
and compression transitions were calculated with natural charges and center-of-
mass correction in operators (2.84). As can be seen, one operator already gives
correct position of giant dipole resonance (GDR). The second operator corrects
also the compression strength function, but much more operators (containing also
spin) are needed for accurate reproduction of the toroidal s.f. Even in that case,
the calculation time for 208Pb is reduced from one hour (full RPA) to around 2
minutes (SRPA with 4000-point strength function).

Other multipolarities are satisfactorily described already with fewer opera-
tors. Figure 3.9 shows results for electric quadrupole (with natural charges; using
ˆQ1, ˆQ2, ˆQ5) and M1 transitions. Magnetic transition were calculated with up to
three operators:

ˆP1 = ~σ · r0 ~Y 0
1µ,

ˆP2 = ~σ · r2 ~Y 0
1µ,

ˆP3 = ~l · r2 ~Y 0
1µ.

(3.6)

The 48Ca M1 s.f. experienced a large shift for 2 input operators, demonstrating
that SRPA is prone to instabilities. Such occasional deviations show that a perfect
description by means of SRPA cannot be guaranteed a priori, and this method
remains mainly an interesting mathematical tool to provide a ﬁrst estimate of
the strength function, when full RPA is numerically not feasible.

Physical results

This chapter will present selected results, either published or submitted for publi-
cation, calculated mostly with full RPA in the axial (cylindrical) symmetry, with
exception of the ﬁrst part dealing with pygmy resonance in spherical nuclei. The
programs described in this work were utilized in the following areas of research:

• toroidal nature of the low-energy (pygmy) E1 mode [25, 26, 58]
• vortical, toroidal and compression transitions by spherical SRPA in tin iso-

topes [59] (not given here)

• low lying 2+ states in rare earths [60] (not given here)
• monopole transitions in spherical nuclei [61, 62] and in deformed 24Mg [63]

(not given here)

• description of axial full RPA with a sample calculation of 154Sm E1, E2, M1

[64]

• magnetic (M1) transitions in deformed 50Cr [65]
Strength functions displayed in this chapter employ a double-folding proce-
dure, which makes the Lorentz-smoothing parameter ∆ energy-dependent. For-
mula (2.82) is then replaced by

Transition densities and currents (2.70,2.71) are calculated either for one state,
or are averaged over multiple states in the given energy interval. In this averaging,
there is an ambiguity in the overall phase factors of the structure constants. For
this reason, the transition currents are weighted by transition matrix elements
[25], which also somewhat suppress the non-collective states, so that the resulting
density better expresses the nature of the excitations in a given energy region.

4.1 Toroidal nature of low-energy E1 mode
Figure 4.1 shows the E1 strength functions, calculated with full RPA for spherical
nuclei with large SHO basis (NRPA = 80 for 40Ca and NRPA = 100 for 48Ca
and 208Pb) and with all center-of-mass corrections (kinetic + operator). Double
folding was done with (4.3). The inset in Fig. 4.1g shows that the (one-phonon)
RPA cannot reproduce the experimentally observed fragmentation in 208Pb [66].

Figure 4.1: Double-folded strength functions of 40,48Ca, 208Pb for E1 transi-
tions: GDR, and isoscalar toroidal and compression. Experimental data are
given for photoabsorption cross section:
40Ca [67], 48Ca [68], 208Pb [69], for
(p, p0)-deduced B(E1) in 208Pb (exp. 2) [66]; and for isoscalar E1 [57]. The tran-
sitions were calculated with full RPA with Skyrme parametrization SLy7 and
including Hc.m. (with HF VAP). Isoscalar transition operators were taken with
zp = zn = 0.5, gp = gn = 0.88 × 0.7

Giant dipole resonance (GDR) of heavy neutron-rich nuclei contains a low-
energy branch, around the nucleon emission threshold (Fig. 4.1g), which is called
“pygmy” mode and is mostly interpreted as oscillation of the neutron skin with
respect to proton-neutron core [47]. To conﬁrm this assumption, I calculated
transition densities (Fig. 4.2) and transition currents (Fig. 4.3) of 208Pb in the
pygmy region (here chosen as 6-8.5 MeV). Weighting operator in (4.4) was long-
wave (isovector) E1 operator to avoid any bias in the interpretation by “forcing”
certain type of motion due to the operator choice.

Although the transition densities appear to conﬁrm the “pygmy” picture of
oscillating neutron skin, we should be careful at this interpretation due to the
fact that the transition density is not sensitive to vortical motion according to
the continuity equation (divergence of curl is zero):
− ikcδρ = −∂tδρ = ~∇ · δ~j

(4.5)
And indeed, Figures 4.3ab and 4.4 indicate toroidal ﬂow, together with the larger
amplitude of the toroidal s.f. in comparison with compression s.f. In fact, a motion

reminiscent of skin vibration appears to be present in the high-energy area of the
compression resonance (Fig. 4.1i, Fig. 4.3ef).

We can therefore assume the following interpretation of the increased low-
energy strength of the photoabsorption cross section with increasing neutron ex-
cess: The low-energy E1 states have mostly isoscalar toroidal nature with some
compression component, and the electromagnetic strength is related to the com-
pensating center-of-mass motion of the protons in response to the compressional
component of the neutron skin. Isoscalar nature of the low-lying E1 states was
also experimentally conﬁrmed in 40Ca [70] and 48Ca [71]. Calcium isotopes were
theoretically analyzed also with second-RPA [72], which includes two-phonon
conﬁgurations, increasing the strength and fragmentation of the low-lying E1
strength, and the characteristic neutron-skin vibration was not conﬁrmed.

The EWSR of the long-wave isovector E1 is exhausted by 0.35%, 0.24% and
1.08% in the selected intervals for 40,48Ca (Fig. 4.4) and 208Pb (Fig. 4.3ab), re-
spectively.

4.2 Deformed 154Sm: E0, E1, E2
Calculation of giant resonances was performed also for deformed nucleus 154Sm,
which has experimental data available for isovector E1 (by photoabsorption) [73]
as well as isoscalar E0 and E2 (by α-scattering) [57]. Parametrization SLy6 [31]
was utilized, which was ﬁtted without the tensor term (tensor term was found
to cause certain problems in axial E1 RPA – too high spurious state and broken
rotational symmetry for spherical nuclei – related probably to the Hartree-Fock).
Equilibrium deformation β = 0.341 was determined by HF. Strength functions of
E0, E1, E2, as well as M1, are depicted in Fig. 4.5. They were calculated by full
RPA and SRPA with 5 input operators

ˆQ1 = rλYλµ,

ˆQ2 = rλ+2Yλ+2,µ,

ˆQ3 = jλ(0.6r . . .)Yλµ,

ˆQ4 = jλ(0.9r . . .)Yλµ,

ˆQ5 = jλ(1.2r . . .)Yλµ

(4.6)

and the single-particle levels were taken up to 40 MeV. In the case of E2 (µ = 0),
the second operator was replaced by r2Y00. The calculation time was around
24 hours for the most demanding full RPA cases (E1, µ = 1, 22570 2qp pairs,
using 8 threads on 12-core 1.6 GHz Intel Xeon workstation and 23 GB of RAM,
spurious state was at 2.102 MeV; and E2, µ = 1, 22558 2qp, with spurious state
at 0.962 MeV), while SRPA calculation took 1 hour for E1, and 2 hours for
E2, respectively, on 2.5 GHz Intel i5 Sandy Bridge laptop (using one thread).
However, the results of full RPA calculation for E2 could be reused to evaluate also
M1 at almost no cost (λ is not a good quantum number in the body-ﬁxed system,
so the multipolarity is provided only by the transition operator). Double folding
parameters were chosen as (4.3), isoscalar transition used zp = zn = 1, isovector

charges were zp = N/A, zn = −Z/A and magnetic transition was calculated with
natural charges. The ﬁrst state of E2 (µ = 1) and M1 (µ = 1) is spurious and
corresponds to rotation of the nucleus.

Isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance (IS GQR) is clearly up-shifted in energy,
compared to the experimental data [57]. This shift is caused by eﬀective mass
smaller than 1 (m∗/m ≈ 0.7 for SLy-forces), while GQR can be accurately repro-
duced with parametrizations having m∗/m ≈ 1 [24] (e.g. SkT6 [32]) – however,
these forces fail to describe the GDR. There was an attempt to resolve such ten-
sions by a new parametrization SV-bas (m∗/m ≈ 0.9) [74], which however fails in
the calculation of M1 transition (due to non-positive-deﬁnite matrix P). For this
reason, and also due to omission of the tensor term and due to the tuning of b0
4
term – which is inconsistent with 2-body Skyrme interaction (2.7) – the SV-bas
force was not used in the present work.

It is instructive to show the transition currents corresponding to individual

branches of the GQR (Fig. 4.6). K π = 0+ branch has a character of β-vibration
and the lowest energy, and mixes with E0 resonance. On the contrary, K π = 2+
branch has the highest energy and a character of γ-vibration, and is relative pure,
so that also separable RPA describes it accurately (Fig. 4.5c).

Finally, two more pictures are given: for the scissor mode of M1 resonance
(Fig. 4.7) and for low-energy mode of the E1 resonance (Fig. 4.8). The ﬁrst case
is not present in spherical nuclei, and the second case shows a clear diﬀerence
between the two components (µ = 0, 1) of toroidal resonance caused by broken
spherical symmetry.

4.3 Scissor and spin-ﬂip parts of M1 resonance

in 50Cr

Recent experimental data on M1 transitions in deformed nucleus 50Cr [65] allow
to investigate accuracy of theoretical predictions for this light deformed nucleus.
Full quasiparticle RPA calculation utilized Skyrme force SGII [30], which was
developed with aim to reproduce the Gamow-Teller transitions. Equilibrium
deformation was β = 0.314. Figure 4.9 gives the comparison of M1 (µ = 1)
transition probabilities, calculated by full RPA (s.p. basis up to 50 MeV), with
the experiment. The scissor mode (see also Fig. 4.10) is concentrated in one state,
in agreement with the experiment, and the spin-ﬂip mode is spread in multiple
states of higher energy. Skyrme calculation underestimates the energy of both
modes, while the weak fragmentation of calculated spin-ﬂip mode is caused by
one-phonon nature of RPA.

Orbital motion of the states beyond 3 MeV is mostly isoscalar, except the
strongest 7.65 MeV spin-ﬂip state, as can be demonstrated by evaluating the
electric quadrupole transition probabilities (Fig. 4.11). The µ = 0 branch of M1
transitions gives minor contribution, and becomes important only in the higher-
energy region (9-12 MeV; see Fig. 4.12).

Summary

Skyrme Random Phase Approximation was successfully implemented for spheri-
cal and axially symmetric nuclei, including the Coulomb and pairing interaction.
Spherical formalism involved advanced angular-momentum-coupling techniques
and enabled to formulate the results in a convenient and rotationally-invariant
way of density/current reduced matrix elements, in contrast with previous for-
mulations, which were either not manifestly invariant [18] or too cumbersome
[19, 20].

Kinetic center-of-mass term was implemented in Hartree-Fock before varia-
tion, as well as in RPA, and led to an interesting behavior with respect to removal
of the spurious motion. Nevertheless, this term can be safely omitted due to rela-
tivelly small inﬂuence on the giant resonances. In the axial case, the logarithmic
singularity of the Coulomb integral was correctly removed by a procedure inspired
by the cartesian case, which can be treated analytically (to a certain degree).
Large-basis calculation on the spherical closed-shell nuclei 40,48Ca and 208Pb
was used to demonstrate the inﬂuence of the oscillator length, tensor (J 2) and
spin terms in Skyrme functional, accuracy of the long-wave transition operators
and separable RPA method. Last chapter gives an analysis of selected physical
topis, such as isoscalar toroidal character of the low-energy (“pygmy”) E1 mode,
electric multipolar resonances in deformed 154Sm and demonstration of scissor
and spin-ﬂip M1 transitions in 50Cr. All these calculations are restricted to one-
phonon excitations with a discrete basis of s.p. states, so the fragmentation due
to coupling with complex conﬁgurations and escape width are simulated only by
Lorentz smoothing of the strength functions. Better description should include
multi-phonon conﬁgurations, however, it is not clear whether such methods are
physically valid for density functionals. For example, the zero-range interaction
leads to divergent correlation energy [75]. If we stay in the present one-phonon
RPA framework, there is still a possibility of extension to β-transitions.

The results of calculations with the methods described in this work were
published in [25, 26, 58, 59, 61, 62] and submitted for publication in [60, 63, 64, 65].

C. Separable RPA in the
spherical symmetry

Calculation demands of the full RPA can grow rapidly as one increases the 2qp
basis. Although in the spherical case the computional load is not so dramatic,
I present here also the separable RPA [23, 24], as a more eﬃcient calculation
scheme, useful mainly for a quick calculation of the strength functions. SRPA is
outlined here according to my master thesis [76], where it was derived for general
wavefunctions, whereas here I assume spherical symmetry, and the ﬁnal formulae
are given in a fully rotationally invariant form.

Residual interaction is ﬁrst approximated by a sum of separable terms

where k labels one of K separable one-body operators ˆX (time-even) and ˆY
(time-odd). These operators will be obtained by means of the linear response
theory from given input operators ˆQqk (time-even) and ˆPqk (time-odd) acting on
nucleons q. I choose a perturbed ground state:

(C.2)

This form was chosen on the basis of Thouless thorem [1], so that it remains a
Slater state, and therefore it makes sense to use mean-ﬁeld density functional.
Eﬀective one-body part of (C.1) in the perturbed ground state becomes

In terms of reduced matrix elements:

(C.6a)

(C.6b)

(C.7a)

(C.7b)

where large parentheses indicate responses of the operators ˆQqk and ˆPqk and they
need to be calculated only once (this is one of the numerical advantages of SRPA;
the second one is the reduction of matrix dimension, see (C.13)). It should be
emphasized that the index q in ˆXqk and ˆYqk denotes the origin of of these operators
(i.e. it labels the corresponding generating operators ˆQqk, ˆPqk), and not the type
of the nucleons on which they act, as it was used in the operators ˆJd;q, ˆQqk, ˆPqk;
the operators ˆXqk, ˆYqk act on both protons and neutrons.

To better approximate the residual interaction, input operators ˆQqk, ˆPqk come
in pairs, where only one of them is given a priori, and the second one is deﬁned
by relations

ˆPqk = i[ ˆH, ˆQqk]

or

ˆQqk = i[ ˆH, ˆPqk],

which in terms of reduced matrix elements turn into

Pqk;αβ = iεαβQqk;αβ − Yqk;αβ

or

Qqk;αβ = iεαβPqk;αβ − Xqk;αβ.

The calculation of the matrix elements then proceeds as

Q → Y → P → X

P → X → Q → Y

Matrices D and F, and the vector ~R are not constant, but depend on the
chosen RPA state ν (or its energy, Eν, respectively), nevertheless, I omit the
index ν, not to increase clutter. SRPA equations are therefore not an usual
eigenvalue problem, since the number of their solutions can be much higher than
the matrix dimension (number of solutions is equal to the number of αβ pairs).
Moreover, during the calculation of the strength function, the matrix D becomes
a continuous function of energy, D(E), so the persistence of the index ν would
cause confusion.

I will evaluate matrix ~R ~R† using (C.16). I will use singularity of the matrix D
(det D(Eν) = 0) and expand it by j-row into algebraic supplements djk (D(jk) is
a submatrix of D with omitted j-th row and k-th column)

(C.20)
where the penultimate equality follows from invariance of det D against addition
of j0 6= j-th row to the j-th row. The previous equation says that djk is a solution
of the equation D ~R = 0 where vector ~R was created from djk using k as a vector
index and any ﬁxed j. So vector components Rk are proportional to djk:

Symbol ∆ is used for two diﬀerent purposes which may cause confusion: ei-
ther as an energy-smoothing parameter (in the units of MeV), or as a grid spacing
(lattice parameter) in the units of fm. There are also some other possible colli-
sions, such as α, b, δ, J, j, Q, P, p, but hopefully all of them should be clear by
the context or by the attributes (index, hat).
