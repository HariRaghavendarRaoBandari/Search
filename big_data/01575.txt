Recent applications of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) technique to Fe-based superconductors
opened a way to directly verify the applicability of the itinerant scenario for these systems. Fe-based
superconductors undergo various instabilities upon lowering temperature (magnetism, superconduc-
tivity, nematicity/orbital order), and one can check whether the hierarchy of instabilities obtained
within the itinerant approach is the same as in unbiased QMC simulations.
In a recent paper
[arXiv:1512:08523] the authors considered the simplest two-band model with interaction tailored to
favor orbital order. The type of the orbital order found in QMC is diﬀerent from the one found in
earlier itinerant analysis. We report the results of our calculations within the itinerant scenario and
argue that they are in perfect agreement with QMC.

I.

INTRODUCTION.

The issue whether Fe-based (FeSCs) can be viewed as
fully itinerant electronic systems, or electrons from some
of the orbitals are localized, has been at the center of the
debates on FeSCs right from their discovery[1–16]. The
itinerant scenario is justiﬁed when the interactions are
smaller than the fermionic bandwidth, and it treats vari-
ous instabilities in FeSCs, such as magnetism, supercon-
ductivity (SC), Ising-nematic spin order and spontaneous
orbital order, as low energy instabilities are determined
by carriers located near hole and/or electron Fermi sur-
faces (FSs) (Refs. [3–8]). Localized scenario, on the other
hand, is justiﬁed when the density-density (Hubbard) in-
teractions are larger than the bandwidth, and within this
scenario instabilities in FeSCs involve carriers from ev-
erywhere in the Brillouin zone [9–15]. The third, Hund
metal scenario, has also been put forward [16] – it as-
sumes that Hund interaction is large enough, in which
case the system retains a metallic behavior but becomes
a bad metal.

The FeSCs are metals for all dopings and composi-
tions, and this would generally place them in the cate-
gory of itinerant systems. At the same time the values of
the Hubbard and Hund interactions in FeSCs, obtained
from ﬁrst-principle calculations, are comparable to the
bandwidth, and some measurements of magnetic exci-
tations in parent compounds have been reasonably well
reproduced in calculations based on both itinerant [17]
and localized [18] scenario. Measurements of the spe-
ciﬁc heat in strongly hole-doped FeSCs (speciﬁcally in
Kx Ba1−x Fe2 As2 for x → 1, Refs.
[19]) have been in-
terpreted both within the itinerant scenario [20], and by
assuming that electrons on some of the Fe-orbitals get lo-
calized [14, 15], and mid-infrared optical data have been
interpreted within the Hund metal scenario [21]. Fur-
thermore, weak coupling and strong coupling scenarios
for FeSCs yield the same set of ordered states – mag-
netism, SC, etc. This all makes it diﬃcult to settle on the
approach. It also raises the fundamental issue whether
FeSCs can be viewed as the ”systems in the intermediate

regime”, which can be gradually reached starting from
weak coupling, but some of the features they display are
inherently strong coupling and are completely missed in
weak coupling calculations.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no experi-
mental data for weakly/moderately doped Fe-pnictides,
which could not be reproduced, at least qualitatively,
within the weak coupling scenario. In Fe-selenades, the
situation is a bit more involved as magnetism in FeTe
– the parent compound of FeTe1−xSex family, is quali-
tatively diﬀerent from that in other parent compounds
of FeSCs (double stripe or plaquette [23] in FeTe vs sin-
gle stripe in other systems [22]) and is only reproduced
within the localized scenario [23]. Still, an orbital order
at x ≈ 1 and SC at x ≥ 0.5 in this material and also in
245 family of FeSCs are all reproduced within the itin-
erant approach [8, 24–27]. This is in line with the idea
that FeSCs, with the exception of FeTe, can be viewed as
itinerant systems, adiabatically extended to intermediate
coupling.

However, the ability to qualitatively explain the data
may be misleading and one needs another tool to ver-
ify whether the behavior of a given FeSC, particularly
the hierarchy of the instabilities upon lowering temper-
ature or changing parameters, diﬀers in any fundamen-
tal way from that in a weakly coupled metal with the
same topology of the FS as in a FeSC. Recent applica-
tion of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to FeSCs
(Refs. [28, 29]) provide such a tool as they allow one
to compare the actual behavior in a fermionic system
with comparable strength of kinetic and potential ener-
gies with the one obtained by using weak coupling per-
turbative schemes for various topologies of Fermi surfaces
and structures of multi-band excitations.
In Ref. [29],
Dmitriesku et al applied QMC to the simplest toy model
for FeSCs – the two band model with Fe dxz and dyz
orbitals, ﬁrst considered by Raghu et al [30]. Although
this model does not reproduce the correct topology of
low-energy electronic states in FeSCs (one of the two hole
FSs is in wrong place in the 1 Fe Brillouin zone), it nev-
ertheless is the simplest toy model with two hole and
two electron Fermi surfaces. Dmitriesku et al further tai-

lored 4-fermion interaction to be local and in the form
†
−g(nxz − nyz)2, where ni = d
i di is fermionic density on
a given orbital, and g > 0. This last condition is diﬃcult
to justify on microscopic grounds because it implies that
intra-orbital Hubbard interaction is attractive, in vari-
ance with ﬁrst-principle calculations [32]. Nevertheless,
the model considered in [29] and in earlier works [33] is
quite interesting for our purpose to compare QMC and
perturbation theory as it favors an orbital order (a spon-
taneous development of a non-zero < nxz − nyz >). An
orbital order is a threshold phenomenon, i.e., it appears
only when g exceeds a certain critical value gc, which is
generally of order of the bandwidth, W. Weak coupling
analysis is an expansion in g, and there is no a’priori
guarantee that the type of orbital order obtained by using
weak coupling approximation and extending g to critical
gc will be the right one.

Diﬀerent types of orbital order in the two-pocket model
include ferro-orbital (FO) order (a Pomeranchuk insta-
bility), which can be in s−wave or d−wave channel,
antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with momentum (π, π),
and stripe-type orbital order with momentum (0, π) or
(π, 0). Dmitriesku et al argued that strong coupling anal-
ysis (an expansion in 1/g) favors AFO order, and they
did ﬁnd the same type of order in QMC. Earlier itiner-
ant calculations, on the other hand found numerically a
diﬀerent, FO order (Ref. [33]).

A. Summary of our results

In this paper we report the results of our analytical
analysis of the orbital order and SC within the itinerant
scenario.

In the particle-hole channel we found that weak cou-
pling calculation shows that the system chooses to de-
velop AFO order, the same one as found in QMC calcula-
tions. Moreover, we argue that some of the particle-hole
polarization bubbles involved in the renormalizations of
the orbital order parameters are logarithmical at interme-
diate energies and, as a result, the critical coupling g = gc
for the orbital instability is small compared to fermionic
bandwidth, W, and is within the range of applicability
of weak coupling expansion. The smallness of gc/W is
due to small sizes of hole and electron pockets and holds
0 , where 0 is of order of Fermi energy. We
in 1/ log W
found logarithms in both AFO and FO channels, but the
prefactor in the AFO channel is larger, hence the leading
instability is towards AFO order.
In the particle-particle channel we found the leading
instability in s++ channel (ordinary s−wave) and sub-
leading instability in the d−wave channel. The renormal-
izations in both channels contain series of conventional
T terms, but also contain terms of
Cooper-type g
order g/0, due to the presence of two weakly dispers-
ing bands, whose energies remain of order 0 over a wide

W log W

2
range of momenta. S-wave channel wins over d−wave
both at truly weak coupling, when Tc (cid:28) 0 and only the
conventional logarithmical terms matter, while at larger
g, terms of order g/0 play the leading role.

We compared critical g for the instabilities in the
particle-hole and particle-particle channels. Within
the ladder approximation, when particle-particle and
particle-hole channels do not couple to each other, the
comparison of the eigenvalues in the AFO and s++ chan-
nels shows that the overall prefactor in the AFO channel
is larger than in s++ channel, but the combination of
polarization operators is larger in the SC channel. We
went beyond the ladder approximation and used renor-
malization group (RG) to include the ﬂow of the intra-
orbital and inter-orbital interactions between high and
low energies due to the actual presence of the couplings
between particle-hole and particle-particle channels. We
found that, due to the ﬂow, the overall prefactor in the
AFO channel is reduced and becomes the same as in s++
channel. Because polarization operator is larger in the
SC channel, the leading instability upon, e,g., increasing
g at a certain non-zero temperature is deﬁnitely towards
s++ SC. The AFO order develops, but at a larger g. This
fully agrees with QMC calculations.

Another result of RG is that couplings in both s++
and AFO channels get enhanced by coupling to stripe
magnetic ﬂuctuations. This enhancement is the strongest
around half-ﬁlling, when there is nesting between hole
and electron pockets [4]. Accordingly, both s++ SC and
AFO order are the strongest near half-ﬁlling. This again
agrees with QMC results.

The structure of the paper is the following.

II. THE MODEL

works, with hoping between dxz and dyz orbitals at near-
est and next-nearest neighbors. The kinetic energy is

where the summation over spin components is assumed
and

Ax,k = A0 + t1 cos kx + t2 cos ky + t3 cos kx cos ky,
Ay,k = A0 + t2 cos kx + t1 cos ky + t3 cos kx cos ky,
Vk = V sin kx sin ky.

The dispersions Ax,k and Ay,k along diﬀerent directions
in momentum space are presented in Fig. 1. The two dis-
persions are obviously degenerate at (0, 0) and at (π, π).
The V term does not remove the degeneracy, but it mixes
dxz and dyz orbitals away from these points. The kinetic
energy in the presence of the V term can be easily diag-
onalized. Near (0, 0) and (π, π) there are two low-energy
modes, each with mixed dxz/dyz character. Out of two
low-energy modes near (0, 0), one crosses the chemical
potential and creates a hole pocket, while the other re-
mains above the chemical potential. The same holds near
(π, π), where the second hole pocket develops.

Near k = 0, Ax,k, Ay,k and Vk are approximated by

Ax,k = 0 − ak2 − c(k2

works we set 0 > 0, a > 0, and a ∼ |c|. For these
parameters, Ea crosses zero at k = kF = (0/(a+|c|))1/2,
while Eb remains approximately equal to E0 at small k.
A similar analysis for k ≈ (π, π) yields the similar form

rections. We used t1 = 2.0, t2 = −2.4, t3 = 4.8, V = 3.8

the chemical potential and forms a hole pocket, while
the energy of the ˜b band remains approximately equal to
˜0. The dispersions near (π, π) become identical to those
near (0, 0) when t1 + t2 = 0. The transformation from
dxz/dyz orbital operators to ˜a and ˜b band operators is

ing φ by 90o, one needs to invoke an additional reﬂection
around, say, x axis.

Near(0, π) ((π, 0)), only Ax,k (Ay,k) becomes soft,
other branch has a larger gap, comparable to the full
bandwidth. The hybridization term Vk vanishes at
(π, 0) and (0, π), hence low-energy excitations near (0, π)
((π, 0)) can be safely approximated as pure dxz (dyz).
These pure excitations form two electron pockets (see
Fig. 1). We label corresponding low-energy fermions as
f1,k (f2,k) with momentum counted from (0, π) ((π, 0)).

where nxz,α(r) = d†
xz,α(r)dxz,α(r) and nyz,α(r) =

yz,α(r)dyz,α(r). This interaction can be cast into more
familiar U − U0 Hubbard form with intra-pocket and
inter-pocket terms:

with U = −2g and U0 = 2g. Like in earlier works, we
set g to be positive, in which case the interaction favors
orbital order with nxz,α(r) 6= nyx,α(r). The model with
a positive g is somewhat artiﬁcial as it implies that intra-
orbital Hubbard interaction U is attractive, but, like we
said, this model allows one to compare QMC results with
analytical results at weak and strong coupling.

The interaction (4) is momentum independent in the
orbital basis, but acquires the dependence on cos θ and

H = X

sin θ of individual fermions, when re-expressed in the
band basis. Namely, each time dxz or dyz operator is
re-expressed in terms of a, b, ˜a, or ˜b fermions, the inter-
action term acquires the corresponding coherence factor
from the transformation from orbital to band basis.

INSTABILITIES IN THE PARTICLE-HOLE

AND PARTICLE-PARTICLE CHANNELS
WITHIN THE ITINERANT APPROACH

A. Orbital ordering

xz − n2

At large g, the potential energy well exceeds the ki-
netic energy. The −g(n2
yz) is minimized when all
fermions accumulate in one band, breaking the orbital
symmetry. However, the potential energy is local and
it alone does not specify the momentum of the orbital
order. To understand what kind of orbital ordering de-
velops, one needs to include the leading corrections in
t/g. These terms favor a checkerboard, AFO order with
momentum (π, π) (Ref.[35]). The same AFO order has
been found in QMC analysis [29]. Like we said, our goal
is to understand what kind of orbital order emerges at
weaker couplings, when potential energy can be treated
as a perturbation and the instability comes from low-
energy fermions, located near the Fermi surfaces.

We compare two types of orbital orders ∆(r) =
q ∆(q)eiqr: uniform FO order ∆(q) = ∆f oδ(q) and

where the integration over k is conﬁned to the FS and
this reduces the integration over position of k on the FS
speciﬁed by θk. In both terms the summation is restricted
to small k. There is no contribution to ∆af o from elec-
tron pockets because out of two fermions from the same
orbital, one has high energy.

To understand when (and if) the system develops an

instability towards any of these orbital orders, we add
to the Hamiltonian inﬁnitesimally small order parame-
ters ∆(0)
af o and compute the full susceptibilities.
The divergence of a certain susceptibility would signal an
instability towards the corresponding spontaneous order.

f o and ∆(0)

We ﬁrst do calculations in the ladder approximation
and then include RG renormalizations of U and U0. In
the ladder approximation (also often called random phase
approximation) one assumes that the dominant contri-
bution to the renormalization of ∆(0)
af o comes
from series of ladder and bubble diagrams with repeated
insertions of the interactions in the same channel,
in
our case particle-hole channel with momentum transfer
either zero or (π, π), while coupling to other channels
(e.h., particle-particle channel) are neglected. Within
this approximation, the fully renormalized order param-
eters ∆f o and ∆af o are expressed via the bare ones as
af o/(1 − Iaf o). The
∆f o = ∆(0)
instability in a given channel develops when the corre-
sponding I = 1. To obtain when (and if) this condition
is satisﬁed, one can neglect the bare values, ﬁnd eigen-
values of the self-consistent equations for ∆f o and ∆af o
and check when the highest eigenvalue reaches one.

f o /(1 − If o) and ∆af o = ∆(0)

The set of self-consistent equations for ∆f o is presented
in Fig. 2. Because coherence factors depends separately
on cos θ and sin θ, one has to introduce a more generic
q = 0 order parameter with components

λaf o would vanish, while λf o would be positive, but of
order g/W, i.e., there would be no instability at g (cid:28) W,
where weak coupling approach is justiﬁed. Because of
cross-terms, the situation is quite diﬀerent in two aspects.
0 (cid:28) W,
First, the instability occurs at g ∼ W/ log W
where calculations are under control. Second, the pref-
actor for the logarithm is by a factor of two larger in
λaf o than in λf o, hence the leading orbital instability
is actually towards the AFO order. That λaf o > λf o
is consistent with QMC results [29]. QMC calculations
show that susceptibility in both channels increases as g
increases and, at a critical gc, diverges in the AFO chan-
nel, while the susceptibility in the FO channel remains
ﬁnite at gc. The QMC study also found that AFO order
develops only at ﬁlling when hole pockets are small but
ﬁnite, and disappears at higher and smaller ﬁllings. This
is also consistent with our analysis because at larger elec-
tron ﬁlling electron pockets grow, and the range where a
and ˜b dispersions have opposite sign shrinks, hence Πa˜b
decreases. At large hole doping, 0 and ¯0 increase and
Πa˜b again decreases, this time because logarithmic en-
hancement gets weaker.

B. Superconductivity

The same interaction Hamiltonian, Eq. (4), also gives
rise to the SC instability, and it becomes an issue whether
this instability develops before or after AFO order sets
in.

The dominant contribution to SC at weak coupling,
when Tc is small enough, comes from states immedi-
ately close to the Fermi surface, i.e., from a, ˜a, f1 and
f2 fermions. However, when Tc is higher, one needs to
include the contributions to the pairing from b and ˜b
fermions, i.e., particle-particle polarization bubbles Πbb,
Πa,b and other terms of the same type. In the analysis
below we keep all contributions in the SC channel. The
calculations are performed in the same way as before(Fig.

and so on, where ∆aa
SC in the
before, we derive self-consistent equations on ∆ij
ladder approximation and obtain eigenvalues. Only the
U term contributes to the renormalization of the pairing
vertex, U0 term doesn’t play a role. In total, there are
16 gap components (if we count ∆ab and ∆ba as separate
variables), i.e., there are 16 coupled equations. By ob-
vious reasons, the equations decouple between s−wave
and d−wave channels. With our choice of variables in

af o = ∆1a,
af o = ∆2a.

The coupled equations on ∆1a and ∆2a are

∆1a = [− (U − 2U0) ∆1a + (U − 2U0) ∆2a] Πa˜b
∆2a = − [− (U − 2U0) ∆1a + (U − 2U0) ∆2a] Πa˜b

where we used that Πa˜b = Π˜ab. Like before, we deﬁned
polarization operator such that Πa˜b > 0. For U < 0 and
U0 > 0 the only positive eigenvalue is

λaf o = 2 (−U + 2U0) Πa˜b

(11)
The corresponding eigenfunction has ∆1a = −∆2a = ∆a.
Substituting into (6) we obtain ∆af o = 8∆a. For U =
−2g, U0 = 2g, λaf o = 12gΠa˜b
We now compare λf o and λaf o. The point for compar-
ison is that for small hole pockets, i.e., for small ratios
Ea,b;0/W = 0/W and E˜a,˜b;0/W = ˜/W, polarization op-
erators Πab, Π˜a˜b, and Πa˜b are logarithmically enhanced
as log W/0 ∼ log W/˜0, because they are made out of
fermions which over wide momentum range have oppo-
site signs of dispersion, i.e., a particle-hole bubble ef-
fectively behaves as a particle-particle bubble, up to an
overall sign. As a result, each of these bubbles behaves
as log W/0. At the same time, Πaa and Πf f are or-
dinary zero-momentum polarization bubbles, and both

i.e., the leading instability in the particle-particle channel
is towards s++ state. The dx2−y2 channel is attractive,
but subleading to s++. This result holds when we in-

Interplay between AFO order and s-wave SC,

the role of RG

Comparing λaf o and λs++ we ﬁnd that at the smallest
g the system only develops an instability towards s++ SC
at an exponentially small Tc. If the system is probed by
varying g at a given T ∼ 0, the selection is less obvious
because the prefactor −2U + 4U0 in the AFO channel
(11)) is larger than −2U for λs++ in (13), while
(Eq.
the combination of the polarization operators is obvi-
ously larger in the SC channel. This uncertainty goes
away once we include the renormalizations neglected in
the ladder approximation. Speciﬁcally, if we apply par-
quet RG technique for multi-band superconductors [4],
we ﬁnd that inter-orbital repulsion U0 > 0 gets renormal-
ized in the particle-particle channel (but not in particle-
hole channel) and ﬂows to zero under RG. This is similar
to McMillan-Tolmachev renormalization in conventional
phonon superconductor [36]. As the consequence, the
prefactor in λaf o becomes the same −2U as in λs++. The
polarization operators are larger in the SC channel, hence
in the ladder approximation, but with running U and U0,
s−wave pairing instability has to develop ﬁrst, i.e., at a
smaller g than AFO order. This is consistent with the
results of QMC analysis. Another result of RG is that U,
and, hence, the couplings in both s++ and AFO channels
get enhanced by the coupling to (π, 0)/(0, π) magnetic
ﬂuctuations [4, 34]. This enhancement is the strongest
in the doping range when both hole and electron pockets
are small in size. Hence, the instability temperatures are
maximized in this region. This again agrees with QMC
results. We caution, however, that using Eqs. (11) and
(13) with the running couplings is an approximation not
controlled by a small parameter. [25].

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper we analyzed instablities towards orbital
order and superconductivity within the two-orbital model
for FeSCs, which has been recently studied in detail by
QMC. We used itinerant approach and argued that it
is applicable because critical coupling g for orbital and
superconducting instabilities is parameterically smaller
than the bandwidth. We found that the leading insta-
bility in the orbital channel is towards AFO order with

parameters ∆bb

The presence of large number of components normally
implies that there exist non-zero eigenvalues in diﬀer-
ent subsets of s−wave and dx2−y2 channels (e.g., s++
and s+−), and one has to verify which sub-channel wins.
However, we found that in in our case there is no such
competition as eigenvalues are non-zero only in the s++
and dx2−y2 channels. These two non-zero eigenvalues are

momentum (π, π), while the one in the pairing channel
is towards s++ SC, while dx2−y2 SC is close second. We
argued that, as g increases at a ﬁxed T, the system ﬁrst
develops s++ SC order and then, at a larger g, develops
AFO order. The latter is conﬁned to the range of ﬁllings
when hole and electron pockets are small in size. The
same two orders and the same phase diagram has been
recently detected in QMC studies. We view the agree-
ment with unbiased QMC as the indication that orbital
and superconducting orders in FeSCs can be properly ac-
counted for within the itinerant scenario.
