THE TRANSFER IS FUNCTORIAL

JOHN R. KLEIN AND CARY MALKIEWICH

Abstract. We prove that the Becker-Gottlieb transfer is functo-
rial up to homotopy, for all ﬁbrations with ﬁnitely dominated ﬁbers.
This resolves a lingering foundational question about the transfer,
which was originally deﬁned in the late 1970s in order to simplify
the proof of the Adams conjecture. Our approach is a direct gen-
eralization of the functoriality argument for smooth ﬁber bundles
with compact manifold ﬁbers.
It leads to a “multiplicative” de-
scription of the transfer, diﬀerent from the standard presentation
as the trace of a diagonal map.

1. Introduction

A transfer is a construction that takes a map X → Y to some “wrong
way” map from Y to X. The prototype of a transfer was probably ﬁrst
deﬁned by Schur in 1902 as a construction in group theory [S]. A half a

century later, the transfer idea was imported into the ﬁeld of algebraic
topology as a wrong way map in cohomology.

In 1972, Roush deﬁned a transfer for ﬁnite covering spaces X →
Y as a stable wrong way map Σ∞Y+ → Σ∞X+ [R].
In 1975, this
idea was expanded on by Becker and Gottlieb to deﬁne transfers for
smooth ﬁber bundles with compact ﬁber [BG1]. This was used to give
a “remarkably simple proof”1 of the Adams conjecture. In 1976, Becker
and Gottlieb produced a purely homotopy theoretic construction of the
transfer using ﬁberwise S-duality, thereby extending the deﬁnition to
the class of Hurewicz ﬁbrations with ﬁnitely dominated ﬁbers [BG2].
For a history of such constructions and their applications, see [BG3].

The transfer is most elementary to describe for a smooth ﬁber bundle
p : E → B with compact ﬁbers and compact base B. We ﬁrst observe
that p admits a ﬁberwise smooth embedding E ⊂ B × Rn for n suit-
ably large. Let τ and ν be the vertical tangent and vertical normal
bundles of p, respectively. The Pontryagin-Thom construction gives a
map Σn(B+) → Eν, where Eν denotes the Thom space of ν. Compos-
ing this with the inclusion of the zero section of the tangent bundle, we
get a map of spaces

Σn(B+) → Eν ⊂ Eν⊕τ = Σn(E+) .

This deﬁnes a stable map p! : Σ∞B+ → Σ∞E+, which is the transfer. It
is well-deﬁned up to contractible choice as n tends to ∞.

As the Pontryagin-Thom construction is functorial on compositions
of embeddings, it is straightforward to deduce that for any composition
of smooth ﬁber bundles with compact ﬁbers

X

p
−→ Y

q
−→ Z

the transfer is functorial up to homotopy, (q ◦ p)! ≃ p! ◦ q! (cf. §3).

Given that the transfer is deﬁned for a larger class of ﬁbrations, it is
reasonable to ask how much more generally functoriality holds. Lewis,
May and Steinberger give a functoriality statement in the context of
ﬁber bundles with a compact Lie group G as the structure group where
the ﬁbers have the structure ﬁnite G-CW complex [LMS, th. IV.7.1].
In [D, thm. 8.7] functoriality is proven for “parametrized Euclidean
neighborhood retracts,” a condition with strong ﬁniteness assumptions.

1In the words of Peter May [M].

THE TRANSFER IS FUNCTORIAL

Essentially, the objects Dold considers are C 0-submersions with com-
pact base and ENR ﬁbers (this in particular includes the case of ﬁber
bundles with ENR ﬁbers).

In the general case of (Hurewicz) ﬁbrations, the question of functo-
riality remains open, even though four decades have transpired since
the homotopy-theoretic transfer was deﬁned.

The purpose of this paper is to settle this question in the aﬃrmative.

Theorem A. Suppose p : X → Y and q : Y → Z are ﬁbrations with
ﬁnitely dominated ﬁbers. Then the transfer (q ◦ p)! coincides with the
composite of transfers p! ◦ q! in the stable homotopy category.

Remark 1.1. The existence of the transfer always assumes a ﬁniteness
condition on the ﬁbers. In the algebraic topology community, the most
common condition is that of homotopy ﬁniteness, i.e., spaces which are
homotopy equivalent to a ﬁnite CW complex. However, for applications
to manifold theory, it is more useful to work with the larger class of
ﬁbrations having ﬁnitely dominated ﬁbers. Recall that a space is ﬁnitely
dominated if it is a retract up to homotopy of a ﬁnite complex.

Remark 1.2. The proof of Theorem A employs the dualizing spectrum
of [K]. Our argument starts with a very explicit proof of functorial-
ity in the smooth ﬁber bundle case, and carefully builds a homotopy-
theoretic analog of each of the terms. The result is a framework for the
homotopy-theoretic transfer which is more “multiplicative” than the
usual construction as the trace of a diagonal map [DP], [MS, ch. 15].
Our point of view seems to be the most natural for the question of
functoriality. It would not be surprising if it had other applications as
well.

There are two other approaches which come to mind in trying to
establish the functoriality of the transfer. The ﬁrst of these is induc-
tive and runs as follows:
for simplicity, consider the special case in
which Z = ∗ is a point and Y as being built up from a point by cell
attachments. Assume Y = Y0 ∪ Dj and functoriality holds for

X0 → Y0 → ∗ ,

where X0 = Y0 ×Y X is the ﬁber product. Let U = Dj ×Y X. Then,
X = X0 ∪ U and as U → Dj → ∗ is trivially functorial, we appeal to
the additivity of the transfer to conclude that the transfer is functorial
for X → Y → Z. Unfortunately, there are technical problems with

4

JOHN R. KLEIN AND CARY MALKIEWICH

this argument since additivity of the transfer is known to hold only up
to homotopy and there is therefore a homotopy gluing problem to deal
with. One way around this might be to prove a stronger statement that
additivity of the transfer holds in the A∞-sense. Unfortunately, we are
not aware of how to prove this.

The other approach which comes to mind arises from considerations
of Casson and Gottlieb [CG]: we attempt to thicken the ﬁbrations to
smooth ﬁber bundles with compact manifold ﬁbers and then appeal
to functoriality in the smooth case. The problem with this approach
is that the existence of such thickenings is generally obstructed.2 To
kill the obstruction one has to take the cartesian product of the total
space with a circle, and taking such a product is known to trivialize the
transfer.

Remark 1.3. Theorem A is a vast generalization of the well-known
statement that the Euler characteristic is multiplicative for ﬁbrations
of ﬁnitely dominated spaces.

To see that, we take Z = ∗ to be a point. In this case denote the
transfer of the map Y → ∗ by χY : S → Σ∞Y+. The map χY represents
the Euler characteristic of Y in the sense that composing it with the
map Σ∞Y+ → S that collapses Y to a point yields a stable map S → S
whose degree coincides with the Euler characteristic of Y .
In what
follows we assume without loss in generality that Y is connected.

In this case, Theorem A shows that χX ≃ p!(χY ), for a ﬁbra-
tion p : X → Y with ﬁnitely dominated ﬁbers. Applying the map
p+ : Σ∞X+ → Σ∞Y+ to both sides yields the equation p+(χX) = p+ ◦
p!(χY ). But one of the basic properties of the transfer is that p+ ◦
p! : Σ∞Y+ → Σ∞Y+ is given by multiplication by the Euler-characteristic
of the ﬁber F of p on singular homology. The multiplicativity of the
Euler characteristic immediately follows.

Outline. §2 is about language.
In §3 we exhibit functoriality in the
case of smooth ﬁber bundles. §4 gives a deﬁnition of the transfer which
involves viewing a space as a module over its Spanier-Whitehead dual
and conversely viewing the Spanier-Whitehead dual as a comodule over
the space; our deﬁnition coincides with the one of Becker and Gottlieb
in [BG2]. In §5 we reduce the problem of checking functoriality to the

twisted by the Whitehead spectrum of the ﬁbers; this is the Converse Riemann-Roch
Theorem of [DWW].

case when q is either 1-connected or a ﬁnite-sheeted covering space. In
§6 we deal with the case when q is 1-connected and in §7 we handle the
case when q is a ﬁnite-sheeted cover. §§6-7 form the technical heart of
the paper and contain large diagrams. We have chosen to include these
diagrams in the interest of transparency, so that an interested reader
may check them directly. This is particularly important because there
have been previous unsuccessful attempts by other authors to prove
Theorem A.

2. Notation and conventions

The spaces in this paper are taken in the compactly generated sense.
Most of our work takes place in the stable homotopy category, so
it does not matter which model of spectra we use, so long as they
form a symmetric monoidal model category. All of our constructions
are derived, unless otherwise noted. We assume throughout that ev-
ery topological group G has a nondegenerate basepoint and has the
homotopy type of a CW complex.

When we must pick representatives for maps in the stable category,
we will use the category of orthogonal spectra from [MMSS], although
this choice is not essential for our arguments to work. We let S denote
the sphere spectrum. We will frequently suppress the symbol Σ∞ for
suspension spectrum, so E+ will almost always mean Σ∞(E+).

When we mention the category of G-spectra, we always mean the
most na¨ıve theory possible. That is, the objects are spectra with an
action of the topological group G, and the weak equivalences are de-
termined by forgetting the G-action.

When we deﬁne point-set maps between mapping spectra F (X, Y ),
we will insist that X is coﬁbrant up to homotopy equivalence, but we
will not take a ﬁbrant replacement of the target Y . This will not get
us into trouble, because X will always be a suspension spectrum of
some ﬁnitely dominated space. Similarly, when we consider a point-
set model for the spectrum of G-ﬁxed maps F G(X, Y ), X will be a
suspension spectrum of a G-ﬁnitely dominated space, and so we will

6

JOHN R. KLEIN AND CARY MALKIEWICH

not need to make Y ﬁbrant. This convention will simplify some of the
more complicated proofs.

3. The fiber bundle case

As motivation for our argument, we consider the case in which
p : E → B is a submersion of compact smooth manifolds and q : B → ∗
is the trivial bundle over a point. Let τ f denote the tangent bundle
along the ﬁbers of p. Then the Whitney sum p∗τB ⊕ τ f is identiﬁed
with τE. Let D+(p) denote the S-dual of the map p+ : E+ → B+; this
is a Pontryagin-Thom collapse map B−τB → E−τE by Atiyah duality.
Similarly, we have the Thomiﬁcation map p−τB : E−p∗τ B → B−τB , which
dualizes to a collapse map D(p−τB ) : B+ → E−τ f. We also have the unit
1B : S → B−τB (the map representing the fundamental class), which is
just the S-dual of the counit B+ → S. Denote the transfer of q by
χB : S → B+; this is the composite (⊕τB) ◦ 1B.

The key observation is that every subdiagram of following diagram

of Thom spectra commutes:

(1)

S

1B

1E

$❏❏❏❏❏❏❏❏❏❏

D+p

B−τB

E−τE

/ E−τB

⊕τB

⊕p∗τB

⊕p∗τB

B+

/ E−τ f

D(p−τB )

/ E+

⊕τ f

The transfer p! of p is the bottom horizontal composite. Hence

p!(χB) = p!((⊕τB) ◦ 1B)

= (p∗τB) ◦ ⊕τ f ◦ D+p ◦ 1B
= (p∗τB) ◦ ⊕τ f ◦ 1E
= (⊕τE) ◦ 1E
= χE .

One can then pass to the case of a smooth ﬁber bundle q : Y → Z
with ﬁber B by performing this construction for each point of Z in a
continuous fashion.

The idea in what follows is to construct an analogue of the above
diagram in in the case of a general ﬁbration of ﬁnitely dominated spaces.

These maps all have explicit geometric interpretations. The maps la-
beled “col” are Pontryagin-Thom collapses. The maps labeled ∆ are
the evident diagonal maps or duplication maps. The map ∇B is a scan-
ning map, which collapses away all pairs of points whose images in B
are too far apart. On nearby points, ∇B thinks of the diﬀerence be-
tween the two points as a tangent vector in B, and uses that tangent
vector to cancel out the −τB. The scanning maps ∇E, ∇M , and ˜∇B
are deﬁned similarly.

It is a pleasurable exercise to check that diagram (2) is a subdivision
of diagram (1) in which all the regions commute, up to homotopies with
reasonable geometric interpretations. Therefore the Becker-Gottlieb
transfer is functorial, for smooth ﬁber bundles. Our proof in the next
few sections will generalize this approach to the case of ﬁbrations with
ﬁnitely dominated ﬁbers.

4. Homotopy theoretic definition of the transfer

In this section we recall the deﬁnition of the Becker-Gottlieb trans-
fer. We describe a “multiplicative” factorization of the transfer that
corresponds to the geometric factorization from the previous section.

Deﬁnition 4.1. For an unbased space X, we write D+X for the func-
tion spectrum F (X+, S). When X is ﬁnitely dominated, this gives the
Spanier-Whitehead dual to X+.

Of course, D+X is a ring spectrum, with multiplication D(δX ) and
unit 1 coming from the dualization of the diagonal δX : X → X ×X and

collapse X → ∗. When X is ﬁnitely dominated, there are evaluation
and coevaluation maps in the homotopy category

eX : D+X ∧ X+ → S

cX : S → D+X ∧ X+

which give the duality between X+ and D+X. The evaluation map is
easy to deﬁne, but coevaluation is slightly subtle. Since X is dualizable,
we allow ourselves to use the isomorphism in the homotopy category

D+X ∧ Y ∼= F (X+, Y )

Under this isomorphism, the coevaluation map is the lift of the identity
map S → F (X+, X+). More generally, the smash product of coevalua-
tion with the identity of Y is the lift of the map

Y → F (X+, X+ ∧ Y )

which smashes Y with the identity map of X.

We deﬁne two maps ∇X and ∆X by the composites

D+X ∧ D+X ∧ X+

D+X ∧ X+ ∧ X+

We use δX to refer to the diagonal map of spaces X → X × X, to
distinguish it from the map of spectra ∆X we are deﬁning above. We
observe that ∇X gives X+ the structure of a D+X-module, and dually,
∆X gives D+X the structure of a X+-comodule. In fact, D+X ∧ X+ is
self-dual and the map ∆X is just the dual of the map ∇X .

If X has an action by a topological group G, then all the maps
above are G-equivariant. To be more precise, we always take G to act
on a mapping spectrum by conjugation, so that the action on D+X is
given by (gf )(x) = f (g−1x). We also take the diagonal G-action on the
smash product of two G-spectra. We emphasize that the equivariant
version of the coevaluation map cX must be the lift of the identity
S → F (X+, X+), in the homotopy category of G-spectra.

Given a ﬁbration p : E → B, with B connected and based, we can
functorially identify B with BG for a suitable topological group G. (For
example, we can take G to be the geometric realization of the Kan loop
group of SB where the latter is the simplicial total singular complex of
B). Hence, without loss in generality, we take B = BG.

Deﬁne a G-space

F := lim
←

(EG → B ← E)

where F is given the G-action induced by the inclusion F ⊂ EG × E in
which G acts on the ﬁrst factor. Then F is a G-equivariant model for
the homotopy ﬁber of p, and E is identiﬁed with the Borel construction
EG ×G F . We adopt the convention that G acts on both F and EG
on the left, and ×G divides out the diagonal G-action.

Deﬁnition 4.2. For any ﬁbration p : E → B with B path connected,
the pretransfer χF : S → F+ is the stable G-equivariant composition

S

1F−→ D+F ∆F−−→ D+F ∧ F+

∇F−−→ F+ .

The transfer p! : B+ → E+ is obtained from the pretransfer by taking
the homotopy orbits:

p! : B+ ≃ EG+ ∧G S

(χF )hG−−−−→ EG+ ∧G F+ ≃ E+ .

When B is not path connected, we perform this operation on each
component of B and add the resulting maps together.

It is easy to observe that our pretransfer gives the same equivariant

map as the composition

S

c−→ D+F ∧ F+

id ∧δF−−−→ D+F ∧ F+ ∧ F+

e∧id−−→ F+ .

Therefore our deﬁnition agrees with the usual one. This deﬁnition pre-
serves weak equivalences, in the sense that weakly equivalent ﬁbrations
are sent to equivalent maps in the stable homotopy category. Therefore
we may assume throughout that F has been made coﬁbrant as a space
with a left G-action.

5. Reduction to special cases

We begin the proof of Theorem A by reducing to two special cases,

which we handle in the next two sections.

Let X

p
→ Y

q
→ Z be ﬁbrations with ﬁnitely dominated ﬁbers F
and B, respectively. Our goal is to show that the transfer for q ◦ p
agrees with the composite of the transfers for q and for p, in the stable
homotopy category. By standard additivity properties of the transfer,
it suﬃces to consider the case where both Z and Y are path-connected.

Let G → P be a homomorphism of topological groups, each homotopy
equivalent to a CW complex, whose classifying spaces are equivalent to
Y → Z. Without loss of generality, the homomorphism is a ﬁbration
(one can for instance use the mapping-path construction on G), and we
let H be the kernel. We remark that G/H has the homotopy type of a
cell complex, and so G has the homotopy type of a free H-cell complex.
Under our assumptions, π0G must have ﬁnite index in π0P ∼= π1Z.
Therefore it corresponds to a ﬁnite-sheeted cover ˜Z → Z, through
which q factors. By an easy diagram-chase, if we can prove functoriality
in the special cases where q is either 1-connected or a ﬁnite-sheeted
covering space, the general case follows.

6. The case of q a 1-connected fibration

In this case we may assume that G → P is surjective. We have a

short exact sequence of nonabelian topological groups

1 → H → G → P → 1

We replace q : Y → Z by BG → BP . Then we pull back p : X → Y
to BG, and replace it by the equivalent ﬁbration EG ×G F → BG.
It suﬃces to prove functoriality for our new ﬁbrations, whose ﬁbers
may be arranged in the homotopy-commuting diagram of homotopy
pullback squares

We recall that H is a normal subgroup of G, and both F and BH =
EG ×H ∗ are ﬁnitely dominated spaces. To set up the rest of our
argument, we recall the notion of the dualizing spectrum from [K].

Deﬁnition 6.1. The dualizing spectrum DH is deﬁned as the derived
homotopy ﬁxed point spectrum

S[H]hH = F H(EG+, S[H]) ,

The H superscript denotes maps which are H-equivariant. As before,
EG has a free left G-action, and H acts on S[H] = Σ∞H+ by left
translation. We make DH a G-spectrum by the action

(gf )(s) := gf (g−1s)g−1

For any G-spectrum E, one has a G/H-equivariant norm map

DH ∧hH E → EhH,

given explicitly by a composite of assembly, cancellation, and the col-
lapse of EG to a point:

F H(EG+, S[H]) ∧H (EG+ ∧ E) ∼→ F H(EG+, S[H] ∧H (EG+ ∧ E))

∼=→ F H(EG+, EG+ ∧ E)
∼→ F H(EG+, E)

In the top-right mapping space, the maps are equivariant with respect
to the left H-action acting only on S[H] by left translation. The ∧H is
then formed from the right translation action, and the remaining action
on EG+ ∧E. Under these conventions, the norm map is a map of G/H-
spectra, and it is an equivalence because BH is ﬁnitely dominated ([K],
Theorem D).

Next we deﬁne the homotopy theoretic analog of the maps ∆B and
∇B from §3. We continue to assume that BH is ﬁnitely dominated and
H ≤ G is a normal subgroup.

Deﬁnition 6.2. For any G-spectrum X, deﬁne two natural G/H-
equivariant maps in the homotopy category

/H
→ F H(EG+, EG+ ∧ EG+ ∧H X)
∼← F H(EG+, EG+) ∧ EG+ ∧H X
µ
→ EG+ ∧H X

The map µ is the action of self-maps of EG on EG+ ∧H X. The G-
actions are the usual conjugation actions.

Remark 6.3. The map /H is only deﬁned when BH is ﬁnitely domi-
nated, while µ has no such restriction. Although /H needs to be deﬁned
as a zig-zag, if we model X hH by DH ∧hH X, then the zig-zag is no longer
necessary.

Proposition 6.4. When X = S, the maps /H and µ coincide in the
G/H-equivariant homotopy category with ∆BH and ∇BH, respectively.

Proof. We begin by comparing /H with the deﬁnition of ∆BH , from
§4. Since coevaluation is given by the unit u of an adjunction, we can
write ∆BH as the composite

throughout this section.) The right-hand rectangle easily commutes,

prove the commutativity of the upper-left triangle in this diagram:

But the lower-right triangle commutes by a straightforward diagram

We conclude that the maps /H and µ are natural variants of ∆B
and ∇B for spectra parametrized over B ≃ BH. In fact, when B is
a compact manifold, they agree with the ﬁberwise variants of ∆B and
∇B that we alluded to at the end of §3. We omit the proof since we
will not use this directly.

This motivates us to draw the following homotopy theoretic analog of
the geometric diagram from §3. Rather than proving the commutativity
of this diagram in a parametrized fashion over Z ≃ BP , we will show
that it commutes in the homotopy category of spectra with an action

All of these maps have been deﬁned as P -equivariant maps, except for
the map f/H, which we will deﬁne when we check that the diagram
commutes.

Proposition 6.5. The diagram (4) commutes in the homotopy category
of P -equivariant spectra.

Proposition 6.5 will immediately imply Theorem A in the 1-connected
case, because we may take the homotopy P -orbits of diagram (4) and
use the natural equivalence

The bottom composite is by deﬁnition the transfer map p! : Y+ → X+.
The diagonal composite is the transfer (q ◦p)! : Z+ → X+, so long as we
are careful to make sure that ∆E and ∇E have the correct equivariant
deﬁnitions. The left-hand composite agrees with the transfer q! : Z+ →
Y+ using Proposition 6.4.

THE TRANSFER IS FUNCTORIAL

Proof. (of Proposition 6.5) In diagram (4), the units easily commute,
and naturality of /H and µ take care of both the left-hand rectangle
and the large square on the right. We are left with a small triangle and
a trapezoid. To check these commute in the homotopy category, we
expand out our deﬁnitions of ∆(−) and ∇(−) as equivariant maps, and
reduce to checking that various strict maps of spectra strictly commute.
By our deﬁnition of ∆(−) as an equivariant map, the small triangle

expands to

We get to pick the map f/H. We deﬁne it just as /H was deﬁned earlier,
the only diﬀerence being that the source in the mapping spectrum is
EG+ ∧ F+ instead of EG+.

It remains to check the trapezoid-shaped region on the right-hand

pands as

For the ﬁnal trapezoid of (7), it seems essential to use the dualizing
spectrum DH from Deﬁnition 6.1, so that both /H and µ can be written
as strict maps and not zig-zags. The maps /H and f/H can be deﬁned
on the source of the norm map η just as easily as they can be deﬁned
on the target, for instance:

F H(EG+, EG+ ∧ F+)

has been made coﬁbrant, and we deﬁne maps out of the coﬁbrant ap-
proximation by deﬁning them on DH itself. This transforms the ﬁnal

We have used the labels F (1) and F (2) to denote the same space F ,
emphasizing that the two copies play diﬀerent roles. One checks that
both routes from the top of the diagram to the bottom commute as
strict maps of spectra, and so the parallelogram in (8) commutes in the
homotopy category. This ﬁnishes the proof of Proposition 6.5.

7. The case of q a finite covering space

In this case, instead of P = G/H, the homomorphism G → P is
an inclusion of connected components with ﬁnite index n. The ﬁber of
the covering map q : Y → Z is the ﬁnite P -set P/G with cardinality
n. The space F still has a G action, and E = P ×G F , which is
non-canonically equivalent to n disjoint copies of F . The diagram of

equivalence, so our usual form for the diagram can be made simpler.

We explain a few conventions for this section. It is desirable to have
P ×G F formed from the left G-action on F and the right G-action on
P , so we also adopt this convention for EP ×G F as well, and assume
that P acts on EP on the right. To accommodate an isomorphism of
P -spectra

(10)

F G(P+, D+F ) ∼= F G(P+ ∧ F+, ∗+) ∼= F (P+ ∧G F+, ∗+)

we give the P in the source a left G-action by multiplication on the
right by the inverse. If X is any G-spectrum, we let F G(P+, X) refer
to maps that send this left G-action on P to the left G-action on X:

f (pg−1) = gf (p)

Then F G(P+, X) has a left P -action given by
(pf )(p′) = f (p−1p′)

It is then straightforward to verify the isomorphism (10).

We freely use the following variant of the Wirthm¨uller isomorphism.

For any G-spectrum X, deﬁne a map

P+ ∧G X ∼→ F G(P+, X)

sending p, x to a map which vanishes outside the left coset of G con-
taining p, and on that left coset it sends pg−1 to gx. This deﬁnes a
P -equivariant map, which is nonequivariantly the inclusion of a ﬁnite
wedge into a ﬁnite product, and is therefore an equivalence. At one
point, we will also use a reﬁnement of this equivalence

P+ ∧G F (X, Y ) ∼→ F G(P+ ∧ X, Y )

which sends p, f to a map that takes pg−1, x to gf (g−1x).

Proposition 7.1. The diagram (9) commutes in the homotopy category
of P -equivariant spectra.

Again, we have set this up so that when we take homotopy P -orbits,
the left-hand column gives q!, the bottom row gives p!, and the diagonal
gives (q ◦ p)!. Therefore the proof of this proposition will conclude the
proof of Theorem A.

Proof. Throughout this proof, p and q will refer to elements of P , not
the ﬁbrations X → Y → Z. As before, only the trapezoid in the middle
and the triangle in the lower-right of (9) pose any diﬃculty. We expand
the trapezoid as (11) and the triangle as (12) on the next two pages.
Let G2 = G × G. Then when we write spectra such as

P 2

+ ∧G2 (X ∧ Y )

or

P 2

+ ∧G2 F (X, Y )

we adopt the convention that the ﬁrst copy of P acts only on X, and
the second copy of P acts only on Y . Each map labeled ∆P duplicates
the P coordinate. The maps labeled |∆P restrict from P 2
+ ∧G2 (X ∧Y ) to
P+ ∧G (X ∧ Y ), by collapsing to the basepoint each summand in which
the pair of elements in P are not identical, up to the right action of G2.
The equivalences are all assembly maps and Wirthm¨uller isomorphisms.
In diagram (11), the three regions making up the big square in the
top-right commute easily. Of the remaining regions, from left to right,
in the ﬁrst both branches are given by the formula

p, f 7→ (pg−1, x 7→ p, f (g−1x), g−1x)

where the map on the right vanishes on q, x when q is in a diﬀerent left
G-coset from p. The function f is a function from F+ into some level

THE TRANSFER IS FUNCTORIAL

21

of the sphere spectrum, and the notation f (x), x refers to the a point
in the same level of the sphere spectrum smashed with F+. The next
region has both branches given by

p, pg−1, q, f1, f2, x 7→ p, q, (y 7→ f1(y), f2(gy), x)

Here we mean that if the ﬁrst two coordinates in the source are in
diﬀerent G-cosets then the map vanishes, and otherwise it is given by
this formula. The last region has both branches given by

p, q, f, x 7→ (pg−1, y 7→ q, f (g−1y), x)

Again, the map we get at the end is nonzero only on the coset of p.

In diagram (12), all regions commute easily, except for the right-

hand region, where both branches have the formula

This ﬁnishes the proof.
