Background: In the last few decades quantum phase transitions have been of great interest in Nuclear Physics. In this context,
two-ﬂuid algebraic models are ideal systems to study how the concept of quantum phase transition evolves when moving
into more complex systems, but the number of publications along this line has been scarce up to now.

Purpose: We intend to determine the phase diagram of a two-ﬂuid Lipkin model, that resembles the nuclear proton-neutron
interacting boson model Hamiltonian, using both numerical results and analytic tools, i.e., catastrophe theory, and to
compare the mean-ﬁeld results with exact diagonalizations for large systems.

Method: The mean-ﬁeld energy surface of a consistent-Q-like two-ﬂuid Lipkin Hamiltonian is studied and compared with exact
results coming from a direct diagonalization. The mean-ﬁeld results are analyzed using the framework of catastrophe
theory.

Results: The phase diagram of the model is obtained and the order of the diﬀerent phase-transition lines and surfaces is

determined using a catastrophe theory analysis.

Conclusions: There are two ﬁrst order surfaces in the phase diagram, one separating the spherical and the deformed shapes,
while the other separates two diﬀerent deformed phases. A second order line, where the later surfaces merge, is found.
This line ﬁnishes in a transition point with a divergence in the second order derivative of the energy that corresponds to
a tricritical point in the language of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for phase transitions.

INTRODUCTION

The study of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) is a hot topic in diﬀerent areas of quantum many-body physics. In
Nuclear Physics many aspects of QPTs have been studied [1–3], both theoretically and experimentally. Also in other
ﬁelds such as Molecular Physics [4, 5], Quantum Optics [6, 7] or Solid State Physics [8] studies related to relevant
QPTs have been recently presented.

QPTs are phase transitions analogous to the classical ones but occurring at zero temperature. QPTs appear when
the Hamiltonian has two (or more) parts with diﬀerent structures (symmetries) and there is one (or several) control
parameter that drives the system from one structure to the other. The phase transition is characterized by an abrupt
change in an observable (called order parameter) that is zero in one phase and diﬀerent from zero in the other. The
value of the control parameter for which the structural change appears is known as critical value. Schematically a
Hamiltonian undergoing a QPT is written as

H(ξ) = ξ · H(symmetry1) + (1 − ξ) · H(symmetry2).

(1)

For a particular value of the control parameter, ξc, which is the critical value, the system undergoes a structural QPT
from symmetry 1 to symmetry 2.

One interesting extension of the QPT concept appears when treating with composed systems, as in the case of
lattice systems [9]. The simplest case is a quantum two-ﬂuid system in which there are two kind of particles (bosons
in the case presented here) with creation (and annihilation) operators that commute among them. Some pioneering
studies on two-ﬂuid systems [10–12] were carried out for the proton-neutron interacting boson model, IBM-2, and
the authors managed to construct the phase diagram for a restricted Hamiltonian and classiﬁed the diﬀerent phase
transitions that the system undergoes. Other models that can be considered as two-ﬂuid systems are the Dicke [13]
and the Jaynes-Cumming [14] models for which the two ﬂuids correspond to photons and atoms. Note that in this case

2

the role of both ﬂuids is not symmetric, photons fulﬁll a hw(1) (Heisenberg-Weyl) algebra while atoms are governed
by a su(2) algebra. In the case of IBM-2, both ﬂuids are connected with a u(6) algebra.

The aim of this work is to study a simple two-ﬂuid Lipkin model, which corresponds to a su(2) ⊗ su(2) algebra.
One of the main motivations for carrying out this study is to treat with a model somehow similar to IBM-2 (except
for the γ−degree of freedom) but simpler. In Refs. [10, 11], when discussing QPTs in IBM-2, because of the large
dimensions involved, exact results (obtained from a direct diagonalization) were only obtained for small values of the
boson number. Thus, a comparison with the corresponding mean-ﬁeld results, valid for N → ∞, was not possible.
Therefore, it is of interest to carry out such a comparison for a model with similar physics content than IBM-2. In
particular, it has been shown that the IBM-1 and the Lipkin energy surfaces are equal [15] and then, their phase
diagrams are fully equivalent. The advantage of the two-ﬂuid Lipkin model with respect to IBM-2 is the smaller
dimensions involved, which allows one to perform exact calculations with much larger boson numbers. Consequently,
this study will allow us to establish a proper comparison with the mean-ﬁeld results. Finally, it is worth noting that
Dicke and Jaynes-Cumming models correspond to a given limit of the two-ﬂuid Lipkin model, in which a contraction
from u(2) to hw(1) is performed [16].

The paper is organized as follows: in Section II the algebraic structure of the model is outlined, while in Section II A
the particular case of the consistent-Q like Hamiltonian is worked out. Section III is devoted to study the classical limit
of the model (mean ﬁeld). In Section IV a numerical study of the phase diagram is presented. Section V is devoted
to the application of the catastrophe theory in the study of the phase diagram and the unambiguous determination
of the order of the diﬀerent phase transitions. Finally, Section VI stands for the summary and the conclusions.

II. THE LIPKIN MODEL AND ITS TWO-FLUID EXTENSION

The Lipkin model was proposed by Lipkin, Meshkov, and Glick in [17] as a toy model that is exactly solvable
through a simple diagonalization and appropriated to check the validity and limitations of diﬀerent approximation
methods used in many-body physics (in particular in Nuclear Physics). Since then, a plethora of applications have
appeared in the literature. Using a boson representation, the model is built in terms of scalar bosons that can occupy
two non-degenerated energy levels labeled by s and t. In the simplest case, the building blocks are the creation s†, t†,
and annihilation s, t, boson operators. The four possible bilinear products of one creation and one annihilation boson
generate the u(2) algebra. If one combines two coupled Lipkin structures, one obtains the two-ﬂuid Lipkin model. In
this model, there are two boson families identiﬁed by a subindex, s†
2, and the corresponding dynamical
algebra will be u1(2) ⊗ u2(2), whose generators are: s†
i ti, for i = 1, 2. If the boson number in each
ﬂuid is conserved, it is also of interest to consider the dynamical subalgebra su1(2) ⊗ su2(2) with generators

therefore, s bosons preserve the parity while t bosons do not, i.e., s has positive parity while t has negative one. In
u(2) this assignment is arbitrary, but in higher-dimensional models appears from physical considerations.

A detailed description of the u1(2) ⊗ u2(2) algebraic structure can be found in [18]. Here, we will present just an
abridged version of that analysis. Starting from the dynamical algebra u1(2) ⊗ u2(2), the possible subalgebras chains
are four: two of them correspond to an early coupling of the dynamical algebras into the direct-sum subalgebra u12(2)
(or su12(2)),

A. The Consistent-Q-like Hamiltonian

A more restricted Hamiltonian, which is inspired in the consistent-Q-formalism of the IBM [19], will be used along
the rest of the paper. This Hamiltonian resembles the schematic one used in many IBM-2 calculations, it was studied
in detail in [10, 20] and will be the reference Hamiltonian in this work. The Hamiltonian can be written as,

H = x (nt1 + nt2) −

1 − x

Q(y1,y2) · Q(y1,y2)

nti = t†

(15)

(17)

(18)

Due to the behavior of the bosons under parity (4), the Hamiltonian (15) is in general non-parity conserving, except
for y1 = y2 = 0. This Hamiltonian (15) can be obtained from the general one (9,13,14) with the following relations

This Hamiltonian is a mixture of dynamical symmetries of the problem, particularly u1(1) ⊗ u2(1) for x = 1, and
su1(2) ⊗ su2(2) for x = 0 and y1 = y2 = 0. This form is specially suitable to study QPTs, because one can associate
a symmetric (spherical) phase to the ﬁrst term of the Hamiltonian and a non-symmetric (deformed) shape to the
second term. Moreover, depending on the values of y1 and y2 diﬀerent kinds of deformation are produced.

III. THE CLASSICAL LIMIT

The study of QPTs should be strictly done in the thermodynamic limit, i.e.

for an inﬁnity number of particles.
Fortunately, this kind of calculation can be easily performed through the use of the mean-ﬁeld approximation which,
indeed, coincides with the exact result in the large particle number limit [21]. The mean-ﬁeld analysis of the model
starts considering the product of two boson condensates, one for each ﬂuid,

where |0i is the boson vacuum and Γ†

i the boson creation operator for the i ﬂuid deﬁned as

The coeﬃcients β1 and β2 are variational parameters associated to each ﬂuid that, in turn, become order parameters.

It could be also of interest to write down the energy for the non-symmetric case for analyzing how the diﬀerence in

model are also indicated in the diagram.

IV. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PHASE DIAGRAM

In order to study the structure of the two-ﬂuid Lipkin model phase diagram as a function of the control parameters,

(x, y1, y2), we have found appropriate to introduce alternative control parameters, (y, y′), deﬁned by,

y =

y1 + y2

2

,

y′ =

y1 − y2

2

.

With this change, we can study the phase diagram in terms of the coordinates,

ρ = 1 − x;

θ =

π
24

(y1 − y2) =

π
12

y′;

φ =

π
24

(y1 + y2) =

π
12

y.

(29)

(30)

Where we have assumed a maximum value for |y1| and |y2| equal to 2 so as the angles θ and φ are deﬁned between
−π/6 and π/6 (see Fig. 1).
The geometric representation of the two-ﬂuid consistent-Q-like Lipkin Hamiltonian will be, therefore, a pyramid in
this phase space. One vertex corresponds to the u12(1) limit of the model (x = 1). The bottom plane, y1 = y2 ⇒

6

y′ = 0, corresponds to the u12(2) dynamical algebra (both ﬂuid are combined symmetrically into a single u(2)) algebra,
which is equivalent at the mean-ﬁeld level to the single Lipkin model (in the IBM-2 case, the equivalent horizontal
plane represents the IBM-1, i.e., a symmetric combination of the two boson ﬂuids). In this plane, the line y1 = y2 = 0
(y = y′ = 0) goes from the so12(2) to the u12(1) limit. As soon as one considers y1 6= y2 (y′ 6= 0) one moves in the
vertical direction of the pyramid and any present symmetry will become broken. Of special interest is the vertical
plane y1 = −y2 (y = 0, y′ 6= 0) because, for this combination of parameters, the mean-ﬁeld energy is invariant under
the transformation β1 → −β2. Note that the two remaining vertexes do not correspond to any symmetry of the model
(in the case of IBM-2 they correspond to the su(3) and su(3)∗ symmetries).
As a ﬁrst step to establish the phase diagram of the model, in the following of this section we will present numerical
studies of diﬀerent trajectories within the phase space of the model (ρ, y, y′) in order to identify the diﬀerent phases
and phase transition surfaces/lines.

To get a geometrical idea about system shapes in the diﬀerent regions of the phase space, we note that the region
around the u12(1) vertex corresponds to values of the variational parameters β1 and β2 equal to zero. Since β
parameters give the weight of the t bosons in the boson condensate, β = 0 implies a condensate of spherical s bosons.
Consequently the phase around the u12(1) vertex is called symmetric or spherical. The corresponding spectrum will
become nearly harmonic. When the system goes well apart of the u12(1) vertex, both variational parameters, β1 and
β2 become diﬀerent from zero. This makes that the boson condensate in both ﬂuids has a fraction of t bosons. Thus,
this phase is called non-symmetric or deformed. The horizontal plane corresponds to β1 = β2 which implies equal
deformations for both ﬂuids what bring us back to the single Lipkin model.

To study the possible phase transitions that occur in the phase diagram we have performed numerical analysis
through selected straight trajectories in the phase space. For each of them the equilibrium energy, the derivatives of
the energy functional, and also the equilibrium values of the variational parameters have been analyzed. All exact
calculations presented in this section correspond to N1 = N2 = 500 but similar studies can be done for N1 6= N2 and
other boson numbers.

FIG. 2: (Color online) Transition line for y = 0 and y ′ = 0 changing the control parameter x. In the diﬀerent panels we plot
as a function of x: panel (a) the energy per boson (in arbitrary units), panel (b) the order parameter β1 (dimensionless), panel
(c) the order parameter β2 (dimensionless), panel (d) dE/dx in arbitrary units, and panel (e) representation of the trajectory
in the control parameter space. Full thin black lines correspond to the mean-ﬁeld results while dashed thick red lines are the
exact calculation with N1 = N2 = 500.

A. Plane y ′ = 0

First, we start analyzing the bottom plane that corresponds to y1 = y2 = y and y′ = 0, therefore an energy surface
fully equivalent to the single Linkin case is reproduced. In Fig. 2 the line y1 = y2 = y = 0 and y′ = 0 is studied (see
panel e), in the ﬁgure the energy per particle (panel a), as well as, the deformation parameters (panels b and c) as

7

a function of the control parameter x are plotted. We have also included the function dE/dx in panel (d). One can
clearly see how a phase transition setups around x = 4/5. At the mean ﬁeld level the phase transition is established
as second order since a discontinuity appears in the second derivative of the energy (see panel (d) where dE/dx is
continuous but not its derivative) and in the ﬁrst derivative of the order parameters. Note that due to symmetry
arguments β1 = β2 over the whole plane. In Fig. 2 the mean-ﬁeld results (black full line) are shown together with the
exact result coming from direct diagonalization (red dashed line) for N1 = N2 = 500. In the exact calculation, the
values of the order parameters are extracted using this relationship,

βi =s hntii
Ni − hntii

.

(31)

Excellent agreement is found between mean-ﬁeld and exact results since the number of bosons considered in the exact
diagonalization is large enough.

In Fig. 3 we repeat the same calculation but for the line y1 = y2 = y = 1 and y′ = 0 (see panel e).

In this
case, a ﬁrst order phase transition is observed for xc = 5/6 = 0.833. The order of the phase transition is clear from
the discontinuity in the value of the order parameter at the mentioned phase transition point, as well as for the
discontinuity in dE/dx (see panel (d)). In general, for y1 = y2 = y 6= 0 the phase transition is of ﬁrst order and the
critical point is located at [15]

Consequently, the location of the critical point is shifted to slightly larger values of x as y increases, while the jump
of the order parameter at the phase transition point becomes larger.

B. Volume region inside the pyramid: y 6= 0 and y ′ 6= 0

Now a trajectory going through the inner part of the pyramid is analyzed.

In particular, the case y1 = 1 and
y2 = −1/2, i.e., y = 1/4 and y′ = 3/4, is presented in Fig. 4 (panel e). From this ﬁgure, it is clear that a ﬁrst order
phase transition is observed at around xc = 0.0.805. Several trajectories inside the pyramid have been studied with
similar results (the dependence on y and y′ of xc is involved and cannot be obtained in a closed form). The size of
the discontinuity depends on how far the values of y and y′ are from y = 0 and y′ = 0.

C. The vertical plane: y = 0

The vertical plane corresponds to y1 = −y2, what means y = 0 and y′ = y1 = −y2 and, as we are showing below,
is the most interesting case. Several trajectories inside this plane will be presented and one crossing the plane from
positive to negative β-values.

The ﬁrst trajectory is the line y1 = −y2 = y′ = 1/2 (panel e) and the results are depicted in Fig. 5. A second
order phase transition at xc = 0.8 is observed. The order parameters, coming from the exact diagonalization, show
an oscillatory pattern due to the degeneracy of two states that are related with the two minima present in the β1 − β2
plane of the mean-ﬁeld energy (see Fig. 9). The degeneracy of two states with diﬀerent deformation makes that
the order parameter obtained from the diagonalization may jump from one minimum to the other (between the two
degenerate mean-ﬁeld values). Indeed, for a given value of x the equilibrium value of one of the order parameters
will correspond to β1 = βx and β2 = β′
x and β2 = −βx. Note that we have taken the
absolute value of |βi| for a better comparison with the exact results, which are, by deﬁnition, positive.
In Fig. 6 a calculation along the line y1 = −y2 = y′ = 1 and y = 0 is presented. In this case is diﬃcult to disentangle
the order of the phase transition just looking at the energy and the order parameters, however, in the inset panel it is
clear that a discontinuity in the second derivative of the energy exists, which, once more, happens at around xc = 0.8.
In Section V B we will see in detail that, indeed, a divergence in d2E/dx2 exists and we will try to understand the
reason why there is a divergence in the second derivative. Note that dE/dx becomes vertical at x = 4/5 from the left
side.

x, while the other to β1 = −β′

Finally, in Fig. 7 the calculation along the line y1 = −y2 = y′ = 3/2 and y = 0 is shown. In this calculation, it
is easily appreciated the onset of a ﬁrst order phase transition at around xc = 0.81, i.e., discontinuity in the ﬁrst
derivative of the energy and in the value of the order parameters.

After the analysis of the diﬀerent paths in the plane y = 0, corresponding to diﬀerent y′ values, one is tempted to
conclude that there is a line of phase transition for values of x around xc = 0.8. However, the value y′ = 1 separates
this line into two parts: for values y′ ≤ 1 the line corresponds to a second order phase transition, while for values
y′ > 1 the line is of ﬁrst order. This weak conclusion, based on numerical calculations, will be conﬁrmed in Section
V B through an analytic study.

It is worth noting that the vertical plane y = 0, for x < 4/5 separates two deformed regions. In order to study the
transition between both deformed regions, ﬁnally, a line crossing this vertical surface is analyzed. Here, because of
the presence of two degenerated minima a ﬁrst order phase transition for the whole vertical surface in the deformed
phase is expected. This is fully conﬁrmed in Fig. 8 (parameters x = 0.5, y = 1), where the ﬁrst order phase transition
appears for y2 = −1. Please, note that in Fig. 8 we have changed by hand the value of β coming from the exact
calculation (it is, by deﬁnition, always positive) for a better comparison with the mean-ﬁeld results.
Combining all the preceding evidences one gets the phase diagram depicted in Fig. 9, where one can appreciate a
ﬁrst order phase transition surface separating the symmetric (spherical) and non-symmetric (deformed) phases and

that the intersection line between both surfaces, from y′ = 0 up to y′ = 1 is a second order phase transition line,
while for larger values of y′ it becomes ﬁrst order. Note that the phase diagram can be extended to negative values
of y and y′, with the ﬁrst order phase transition surface separating spherical and deformed phase extended to four
quadrants and the vertical ﬁrst order phase transition surface and the second order phase transition line extended to
negative values of y′.

V. LOCAL TAYLOR EXPANSION AND CATASTROPHE THEORY

A. Fundamentals

Once the main structure of the phase diagram of the model is known numerically, it is necessary to perform an
analytic study to determine unambiguously the order of the phase transitions of surfaces and lines appearing in the
phase diagram and to understand why the QPT areas are precisely located there. To carry out this task we will make
use of catastrophe theory (CT) [22], which is an ideal tool for such an end.

11

FIG. 9: (Color online) Phase diagram of the consistent-Q like two-ﬂuid Lipkin model. In the diagram the diﬀerent phases
are represented: spherical and deformed, the ﬁrst order QPT surfaces and the second order QPT line. Moreover, the relevant
control parameters and dynamical symmetries also are shown.

In general, the aim of CT is to study a given potential, V (~x, ~λ) ∈ ℜ (in our case the mean-ﬁeld energy surface of
the model) or a family of potentials that are function of a set of order parameters, ~x ∈ ℜn and that depend on a set
of control parameters, ~λ ∈ ℜr, and to study the qualitative behavior of the potential, e.g., number of minima and
maxima, as a function of the control parameters. To proceed one should start looking for the stationary points (also
known as critical points), i.e., those whose gradient vanish and classify them according to their stability:
i) points
where the determinant of the Hessian matrix is diﬀerent from zero, called isolated, non-degenerated or Morse points,
and ii) points where the determinant of the Hessian matrix is zero, called non-isolated, degenerated or non-Morse
points. In summary, points of a family of smooth potentials can be classiﬁed according to their gradient and Hessian
matrix H as:

• Regular points: ∇V 6= 0.
• Morse points (isolated critical points): ∇V = 0 and |H| 6= 0.
• Non-Morse points (degenerated critical points): ∇V = 0 and |H| = 0.
Morse theorem [23, 24] guarantees that around a Morse point, a smooth potential is equivalent to a quadratic form,
performing a smooth non-linear change of variables. Therefore, the potential is stable under small perturbations
around Morse points. At non-Morse points the potential cannot be written as a quadratic form because the Hessian
matrix has at least one zero eigenvalue. Around non-Morse points CT will provide useful information on how the
qualitative shape of the potential will evolve under small variations of the order parameters.

In the case of several order parameters, Thom’s splitting lemma [22] guarantees that a smooth potential at non-
Morse points can be written as a sum of a quadratic form, associated to the subspace with nonzero eigenvalues, plus
a function containing the variables associated to the zero eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix.

The ﬁrst step in the CT program is to ﬁnd out the critical points of the energy surface (∇E = 0). Among them,
the most important is the most degenerate one, i.e., the point where most successive derivatives vanish. This point
is the fundamental root taking place at deﬁnite values of the control parameters which we will call critical values.
We next proceed making use of a Taylor expansion of the energy surface around the fundamental root. A Taylor

12

expansion around such a point is also valid for the critical points that arise from the fundamental root when the
degeneracy is broken. Depending on the degeneracy of the fundamental root the number of extremes that can be
analyzed simultaneously will change. It is worth to note that the diﬀerent minima related with the appearance of a
critical phenomenon arise from a degenerated non-Morse point.

When the potential depends on several variables, as the case for the two-ﬂuid Lipkin model is, it is important to
separate the variables into two sets, depending on how Hessian eigenvalues behave. On one hand, one has the variables
associated to the subspace with vanishing Hessian eigenvalues, called bad or essential variables, while, on the other
hand, there is a set of variables related to the non-vanishing Hessian eigenvalues, called good or non-essential variables.
Therefore, as a consequence of the splitting lemma [22], the potential could be separated into a part depending on
the essential variables and into another part depending on the non-essential ones by rewriting it in terms of the
eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix [24]. The appearance of critical phenomena will be associated exclusively with the
behavior of the essential variables, i.e., the variables that can be identiﬁed as order parameters of the system.

B. Application to the two-ﬂuid Lipkin model

According to Eqs. (27) and (28) the most degenerated critical point for the two-ﬂuid Lipkin model (15) corresponds
to β1 = 0 and β2 = 0 (all derivatives up to fourth order vanish for an appropriated set of parameters) and, taking
into account the shape of the phase diagram, all the critical points that can eventually arise in the energy surface are
born from this most degenerated critical point. Since there are two shape variables it is necessary to construct, ﬁrst,
the Hessian matrix associated to the energy surface (27),

The eigenvalue associated to βa vanishes for x = 4/5 while the one associated to βb only vanishes for the trivial case
x = 0. Therefore, the essential variable turns out to be βa, while βb becomes the non-essential one, i.e., the origin in
this variable behaves as a Morse point.

Next step is to carry out a Taylor expansion in βa and βb around zero. Because we use βa and βb, the quadratic

term βaβb will not be present in the Taylor expansion. Note that we are considering the case N1 = N2.

The number of lower order terms that are kept in the Taylor expansion without loosing substantial information with
respect to the original function (problem of determinacy) is determined studying the terms in the Taylor expansion
that can be canceled out with appropriated particular values of the control parameters. For Eq. (37) the values of
the control parameters, x = 4/5, y = 0 and y′ = 1 cancel all terms up to β5
a. Therefore, the dominant remaining
term is β6
a and it is said that the function is 6 − determined. Hence, the number of essential parameters will be 3.
Consequently, the relevant elementary catastrophe of this model is the butterﬂy (A+5) [24]. It is worth mentioning
that the butterﬂy has a codimension equal to 4, i.e., the number of essential parameters is 4. In our case, due to
the function symmetry, the number of parameters is only 3. In general, depending on the values selected for the
control parameters, the potential energy may have three, two, or one local minima. Please note that Eq. (37) does
not correspond to the canonical form of the butterﬂy because it presents a ﬁfth order term instead of the ﬁrst order
one. However, one always can perform a shift transformation in the βa variable to recover the canonical form.

In order to determine the order of the phase transitions, already studied numerically in the preceding section, we
can take advantage of Eq. (37). In general, for any situation with y 6= 0 the cubic (and ﬁfth) term always survives
for any value of y′ and, therefore, the phase transition will become ﬁrst order. The reason is simple, the presence of a
cubic (and ﬁfth) term guaranties the possible appearance of several critical points (i.e., a region of coexistence), three
critical points (two minima and one maximum) when the β2
a coeﬃcient are positive and ﬁve
critical points (three minima and two maxima) when the β2
a coeﬃcient is negative
(see below for more details). Note that in our case, the β6

situation is precisely the one necessary to develop a ﬁrst order phase transition. This happens in almost the whole
surface separating the symmetric (spherical) and non-symmetric (deformed) phases.

a coeﬃcient is always positive.

a with negative coeﬃcient and β4

To know the character of the vertical surface, y = 0 (with x < 4/5), one can note that the lowest leading terms
are: β2
a with positive coeﬃcient. This potential gives rise to two degenerated minima
symmetric with respect to the origin, βa = 0. As soon as one perturbs the system, changing y (to either positive
or negative values) the degeneracy is broken and one of the deformed minima is lower in energy. Therefore, this
situation corresponds to a ﬁrst order phase transition since the order parameter will jump suddenly from one to the
other minimum.

It is also of interest to see how one can recover the case corresponding to the single Lipkin, i.e., y′ = 0. For this

case (horizontal plane) the energy surface reads as,

E(x, y, y′, βa, βb)

= (5x − 4)β2

(38)

where one can easily single out that for the line x = 4/5, values y 6= 0 produce a ﬁrst order phase transition since
the cubic term is present. For the particular value y = 0 the cubic term vanishes and, therefore, the transition is no
longer of ﬁrst order, but of second order.

Finally, a most interesting case is the intersection line between the surfaces y = 0 (vertical plane, separating two
regions of diﬀerent deformation) and x ≈ 4/5 (spherical surface separating spherical from deformed shapes). For this
situation, the energy functional is written as,

(39)

This situation looks like the case y = y′ = 0, because no odd terms appear in the expansion and only the onset of a
second order phase transition is expected. However, there are fundamental diﬀerences. The key point to disentangle
the stability structure of the energy surface is the sign of the fourth order coeﬃcient. The phase transition at x = 4/5
is indeed of second order if the fourth order coeﬃcient remains positive but will change to ﬁrst order otherwise. There
is a critical value for y′ for which the fourth order coeﬃcient vanishes, i.e., y′ = 1 and x = 4/5. At this point, the
only term that survives in the energy functional is the sixth order term. The most important consequence is that at
this point the energy surface is very ﬂat (as β6
a). Going to values with y′ > 1, the fourth order coeﬃcient changes to
negative sign, which implies that there is no longer a second order phase transition, but a ﬁrst order one since, in this
case, there is a sudden change in the order parameter when crossing the QPT point. To understand this fact let us
write in a more compact form the Taylor expansion (39) as,

where C > 0. According to Eq. (39): A > 0 for x > 4/5, A < 0 for x < 4/5 and A = 0 for x = 4/5; at x = 4/5,
B > 0 for y′ < 1, B < 0 for y′ > 1, and B = 0 for y′ = 1; for x ≈ 4/5 C is always positive. Equation dE/dβ = 0 has

(41)

The spherical solution (β = 0) corresponds to a minimum if A > 0, i.e., x > 4/5 (to a maximum if A < 0, i.e.,
x < 4/5 ), irrespective of the B sign, i.e., independently of the y′ value. For A < 0 and B > 0 (which occurs for
|y′| < 1) two deformed critical points exist (symmetric with respect to the origin), which correspond to minima since,
as discussed above, β = 0 corresponds, in this case, to a maximum. Note that for A = 0 the two deformed minima
merge into a ﬂat spherical one, never coexisting several minima. Therefore, the line y = 0 and A = 0 corresponds to
a second order phase transition while |y′| < 1.
For A & 0 and B < 0 (which occurs for y′ > 1 and x & 4/5) ﬁve critical points coexist for B2 > 4AC, one
corresponds to the spherical minimum, and other two correspond to two deformed minima (symmetric with respect
to the origin, βa = 0). The other two extremes correspond to maxima (symmetric with respect to the origin). The
particular region y = 0, A = 0 (x = 4/5) for values y′ > 1, is a region of coexistence of three minima, one spherical
and two deformed. At the critical point all three minima are degenerated. As a consequence, a ﬁrst order phase
transition develops around this line. The ﬁrst order phase transition line is deﬁned then by

and is bounded by the spinodal ((∂2E/∂β2)β=0 = 0) and the antispinodal ((∂2E/∂β2)β=βc6=0 = 0) lines given by,

For the case B2 < 4AC only the spherical minimum exists.

It is worth analyzing what happens at the special line y = 0 and y′ = 1. For this line B = 0 and the energy surface

presents three critical points when A < 0 (x < 4/5),

The ﬁrst one, spherical, corresponds to a maximum and the second and the third, deformed and symmetric with
respect to the origin, correspond to minima. For A > 0 (x > 4/5) only the minimum at β = 0 survives. In order to
study the QPT at x = 4/5, one can write the energy at the equilibrium β−value (46) that is,

deformed side the second derivative diverges to −∞.
In Fig. 10 we show, once more, the phase diagram, but in this case plotting the corresponding energy curves as a
function of the value of the essential variable. In this ﬁgure one can appreciate in a cleaner way how the ﬁrst order
vertical plane is related to two symmetric degenerated minima, symmetric with respect to βa = 0, while the ﬁrst
order surface separating spherical and deformed phases corresponds also to two degenerated minima, spherical and
deformed. The line x = 4/5, y = 0, y′ < 1 corresponds to a β4
1 energy curve, i.e., to a cusp line. The point x = 4/5,
y = 0, y′ = 1 corresponds to a β6
1 energy curve and, ﬁnally, a ﬁrst order phase transition line appears for x ≈ 4/5,
y = 0, y′ > 1 with three degenerated minima. The behavior of this ﬁrst order phase transition area is explained in
detail in Fig. 11, where as a function of the control parameters A and B is depicted the phase diagram, separating
the areas corresponding to spherical (blue area), deformed shapes (red area) or coexistence area (yellow area). Also
spinodal, antispinodal and ﬁrst order line are shown.

Indeed in the

control parameters A and B. The energy curves that characterize every region are depicted, besides, the curves corresponding
to lines/points with degenerated critical points are also depicted.

At the point A = 0, B = 0, i.e., x = 4/5, y = 0, and y′ = 1 the second order phase transition line (B > 0) and the
spinodal, antispinodal and ﬁrst order phase transition merge. This point is known as tricritical point while the ﬁrst
order phase transition line corresponds to a triple point curve where three minima are degenerated and coexist.

16

The inclusion of a third (and a ﬁfth) order term in the potential (40) will break the symmetry of the function.
The consequence will be the appearance of a coexistence region for the cusp line and, therefore its transformation in
a ﬁrst order phase transition line. In the case of the coexistence area with B < 0 the asymmetry generated in the
energy curves will make impossible the degeneracy of three minima, but however, will continue being possible the
degeneracy of the spherical and one of the deformed minima. Moreover the spinodal line is still at A = 0 too, though
the antispinodal one will be shifted. As a consecuence, in this case, the phase transition is still of ﬁrst order.

VI. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work the mean-ﬁeld energy surface of the consistent-Q like double Lipkin Hamiltonian has been studied.
The analyzed Hamiltonian resembles the IBM-2 Hamiltonian of interest in Nuclear Physics. The phase diagram of
the model has been established both numerical and analytically. The mean-ﬁeld numerical calculations have been
compared with direct diagonalizations and good agreement has been reached. The analytical study has been performed
using the catastrophe theory and it has been found that the energy can be successfully described by the butterﬂy
catastrophe.

Therefore, the phase diagram of the model has been obtained, including phases, locations of the QPT phase
transitions and their orders. In particular, there are three phases: spherical and two diﬀerent deformed ones. The
surface separating spherical and both deformed phases is of ﬁrst order: two minima, one spherical and one deformed,
which are degenerated at the phase transition point. Moreover, the vertical plane separating both deformed phases is
also of ﬁrst order: two deformed minima with diﬀerent deformations are degenerated and separated by a maximum at
βa = 0. These two surfaces intersect in the line (x = 4/5, y = 0), this is of second order for 0 < y′ ≤ 1 and transforms
to a ﬁrst order phase transition for y′ > 1. The part of the line (x = 4/5, y = 0, 0 < y′ < 1) corresponds to a ﬂat
surface (goes as β4
a. Finally,
in the part of the line (x ≈ 4/5, y = 0, y′ > 1) three degenerated minima coexist (one spherical and two deformed
ones). The point x = 4/5, y = 0 and y′ = 0 corresponds to a tricritical point in the language of the Ginzburg-Landau
theory for phase transitions.

a). At the point (x = 4/5, y = 0, y′ = 1) the energy surface is even ﬂatter, goes as β6
