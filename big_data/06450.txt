DOUBLY QUENCHED CONVERGENCE AND THE ENTROPY OF ALGEBRAIC

ACTIONS OF SOFIC GROUPS

BEN HAYES

Abstract. Let G be a soﬁc group and X a compact group with G y X by automorphisms. Using (and

reformulating) the notion of doubly-quenched convergence developed by Austin, we show that in many

cases the topological and the measure-theoretic entropy with respect to the Haar measure of G y X agree.

Our method of proof recovers all known examples. Moreover, the proofs are direct and do not go through

explicitly computing the measure-theoretic or topological entropy.

1. Introduction

This paper is concerned with studying entropy for actions of soﬁc groups on compact groups by automor-

phisms. Entropy for probability measure-preserving actions of soﬁc groups was initiated in ground-breaking

work of Bowen in [2] under the assumption of a ﬁnite generating partition. Work of Kerr-Li in [14] removed

this assumption, deﬁned topological entropy for actions of soﬁc groups and proved a variational principle for

entropy. The work of Bowen, Kerr-Li thus extended the classical notion of entropy for actions of amenable

groups to the vastly larger class of soﬁc groups.

One class of actions whose entropy theory has received much interest is the case of automorphsims on

compact groups. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group, let X be a compact group and suppose that

G y X by automorphisms. One can think of this as a topological dynamical system and also a probability

measure-preserving system giving X the Haar measure (which we denote by mX ). When G is amenable

Deninger proved (see [5] Theorem 3) that the topological and measure-theoretic entropy coincide.

While such a general equality of entropies is impossible in the nonamenable case (e.g. if X is ﬁnite and G

is the free group on two generators there always soﬁc approximations for which the entropy of G y (X, mX )

is −∞), certain cases of such an equality have been proved for general soﬁc groups. Let f ∈ Mm,n(Z(G))
and deﬁne r(f ) : Z(G)⊕m → Z(G)⊕n by

(rf )ξ)(j) =

mXl=1

ξ(l)flj, for 1 ≤ j ≤ m.

Let Xf be the Pontryagin dual of Z(G)⊕n/(r(f )(Z(G)⊕n)) (i.e. the space of continuous homomorphisms
Z(G)⊕n/(r(f )(Z(G)⊕m)) into T = R/Z) and let G y Xf by

(1)

(gχ)(a) = χ(g−1a), a ∈ Z(G)⊕n/(r(f )(Z(G))⊕m).

When m = n = 1 this is called a principal algebraic action. Work of Bowen-Li [16], as well Kerr-Li and

Bowen ([14],[3]) proved equality of topological and measure-theoertic entropy for certain principal algebraic

actions when G is residually ﬁnite and under some restrictions f. Speciﬁcally [14],[3] require that f has
a convolution inverse in ℓ1 (though the computation of topological entropy in [14] only requires that f is
invertible in the full C∗-algebra of G). Whereas [16] require that f is (up to multiplicative constant) a

Laplace operator (which, if G is nonamenable, imply that f is invertible in the group von Neumann algebra

of G). We mention our previous work in [7], for which we need more notation. For a countable, discrete
group G and f ∈ C(G), deﬁne λ(f ) : ℓ2(G) → ℓ2(G) by

(λ(f )ξ)(g) = Xh∈G

f (h)ξ(h−1g), for all g ∈ G

For A ∈ Mm,n(C(G)) we deﬁne λ(A) : ℓ2(G)⊕n → ℓ2(G)⊕m by

(λ(A)ξ)(l) =

nXj=1

λ(Alj )ξ(j) for 1 ≤ l ≤ n.

Our previous work in [7] proved equality of measure-theoretic and topological entropy for G y Xf under

the assumption that f ∈ Mm,n(Z(G)) and that λ(f ) has dense image for completely general soﬁc groups

(additionally it is not required that m = n = 1, though it is implied that m ≤ n). Each of these works

proved this result indirectly, by explicitly computing both the topological and measure-theoretic entropy

to be equal to the Fuglede-Kadison determinant. Kerr-Li in [14], Problem 7.7 asked if there is a direct

way to see this equality without having to compute both entropies. Progress on this problem was made by

Gaboriau-Seward in [6] who gave the ﬁrst general results on equality of topological and measure-theoretic

entropy without directly computing either entropy. Speciﬁcally, they showed equality of the entropies when

G y X by automorphisms, where X is any proﬁnite group and when the homoclinic group of G y X is

dense.

In this paper, we present a proof of this equality under fairly general hypotheses. Our work uses the notion

of doubly-quenched convergence in [1]. We brieﬂy describe doubly-quenched convergence. By deﬁnition,

soﬁcity of G allows one to ﬁnd maps σi : G → Sdi (here Sn is the group of permutations of {1, . . . , n}), for

some sequence of integers di, which give good ﬁnitary models of the action of G on itself. These maps are

not assumed to be homomorphisms, but this defect of not being a homomorphisms only occurs on a small

portion of {1, . . . , di}. Moreover, if one pretends that these maps give actions of G, then for any g ∈ G the

DOUBLY QUENCHED CONVERGENCE AND THE ENTROPY OF ALGEBRAIC ACTIONS OF SOFIC GROUPS

3

set of points in {1, . . . , di} which are ﬁxed by σi(g) again only occupies a small portion of {1, . . . , di}. Brieﬂy,

we can then think of these maps as giving “almost free almost actions.” Now ﬁx a compact space X and

let G y X by homeomorphisms ﬁxing a probability measure µ. The soﬁc entropy of G y (X, µ) counts the

exponential growth rate of “how many” maps φ : {1, . . . , di} → X there are which are almost equivariant

for the almost action of G on {1, . . . , di} and approximately pushforward the uniform measure to the Haar

measure. We will call these maps “microstates” (this is a heuristic term that will not be deﬁned precisely).

Typically these microstates for G y (X, µ) are produced by a probabilistic argument. In many cases this

probabilistic argument is no accident:

if G is residually ﬁnite, if G y (X, µ) is ergodic and has a ﬁnite

generating parition, Bowen in [3] shows how one can compute soﬁc entropy in terms of certain probability
measures on X di which in some sense model the µ. Moreover, the proof in [3] easily extends to the case that

G is merely soﬁc instead of residually ﬁnite. Austin’s work in [1] modiﬁes the methods in [3], considering
a slightly diﬀerent way to say that a sequence of measures µi ∈ Prob(X di) models µ. Roughly, the main

diﬀerence is that Bowen requires that for all f ∈ C(X)

and that Austin requires

and for every f ∈ C(X). Thus Bowen’s approach is to require convergence of RX di f (x(j)) dµi(x) to R f dµ
on average and Austin’s reuqirement is that RX di f (x(j)) dµi(x) is close to R f dµ with high probability in

j. This is what Austin in [1] calls the quenched convergence of µi to µ. Strictly speaking, this is not the
deﬁnition Austin gives in [1]. Austin works with invariant measures on the left shift space X G for some

compact, metrizable space X. We shall spend much of Section 2 translating between the version of quenched

convergence describe above and the version given in [1]. Also considered in [1] is the notion of doubly-

quenched convergence which requires that µi ⊗ µi quenched converges to µ ⊗ µ. The work in [1] connects

doubly-quenched convergence in an important way to various additivity properties of entropy and also gives
a new approach to soﬁc entropy, based directly on the consideration of measures µi ∈ Prob(X di) which

quenched converge to µ. Doubly-quenched convergence of measures ends up being the right tool to prove the

equality of measure-theoretic and topological entropy.

To state our results, we need the notion of entropy in the presence. Suppose that G y (X, µ) is a

probability measure-preserving action and that G y (Y, ν) is a factor of G y (X, µ) with factor map π.

Entropy in the presence, denoted h(σi)i,µ(Y : X, G), measures “how many” microstates for G y (Y, ν) there
are which lift to microstates for G y (X, µ). Entropy in the presence stands in contrast to the usual entropy

which just measures “how many” microstates for G y (Y, ν) there are (with no regard as to whether or

not the come from microstates for G y (X, µ) or not). Note that h(σi)i,µ(X : X, G) is just the entropy of
G y (X, µ), which we denote by h(σi)i,µ(X, G). Entropy in the presence was implicitly deﬁned by Kerr in
[12] and our previous work in [9] showed how one can compute entropy in the presence in terms of a given

topological model. Suppose that we have a compact space and an action G y X by homeomorphisms, given

a topological factor G y Y one can also consider the topological entropy in the presence which we denote by

h(σi)i,top(Y : X, G). Again in the case that Y = X this is just the topological entropy, which we denote by
h(σi)i,top(X, G). Topological entropy in the presence was deﬁned in [18] Deﬁnition 9.3 and the formulation
of topological entropy in the presence is close to what we have developed in [9] (see also Deﬁnitions 3.3 and

3.4 in this paper). In [18], Li-Liang use the term “entropy relative to an extension,” but we will use the term

“entropy in the presence” to be consistent with our earlier terminology. Additionally, in later work we will

develop relative entropy for actions of soﬁc groups and we do not want to confuse “entropy in the presence”

with relative entropy. Note that, as we showed in [9], if G is amenable, h(σi)i,µ(Y : X, G) = hµ(Y, G) where
hµ(Y, G) is the classical entropy deﬁned for amenable groups. We now state the main theorem of the paper.

Theorem 1.1. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be
a compact, metrizable group with G y X by automorphisms. Suppose that there exists µi ∈ Prob(X di) with
µi →dq mX . Then for any closed, normal, G-invariant subgroup Y ⊆ X we have

h(σi),top(X/Y : X, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X/Y : X, G).

In particular, (taking Y = {1}) the topological entropy (with respect to (σi)i) of GyX and the measure-

theoretic entropy (with respect to (σi)i) of Gy(X, mX ) agree.

It is shown in [1] Corollary 5.18 that for a probability measure-preserving action G y (X, µ) the existence

of a sequence of measures which doubly quenched converge to µ is preserved under measure-theoretic factors.

It follows that in Theorem 1.1 we in fact have

h(σi)i,top(X/Y, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X/Y, G)

for every closed, normal, G-invariant subgroup Y ⊆ X. The ability to take factors by normal subgroups

in Theorem 1.1 will be important in our follow-up paper where we will use Theorem 1.1 and our prevous

results in [8] to give new examples of algebraic actions of nonamenable groups which have completely positive

entropy in the presence. This will require an investiagation of the strucutral properties of the Outer Pinsker

factor for soﬁc groups (whose deﬁntion is folklore, but was ﬁrst written down in [9]).

We remark that the existence of a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) which doubly-quenched converge to µ is
automatic in the amenable case. Thus our results recover the result of Deninger in [5] on equality of

topological and measure-theoretic entropy for actions on compact groups. Moreover, the existence of a
sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) which quenched converge to µ is implicitly shown in every case where entropy has

been computed. Speciﬁcally we have the following proposition.

Proposition 1.2. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. For
each of the following probability measure-preserving actions G y (X, µ) there is a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di)
with µi →dq µ:

(i) G y (X, µ) any Bernoulli action (implicitly shown in [2] and explicitly shown in [1]),

DOUBLY QUENCHED CONVERGENCE AND THE ENTROPY OF ALGEBRAIC ACTIONS OF SOFIC GROUPS

5

(ii) X = Xf , µ = mXf for some f ∈ Mm,n(Z(G)), with action given by (1) and with λ(f ) having dense

image (implicit in [7]),

(iii) X = Xf , µ = mXf for some f ∈ Mn(Z(G)), with action given by (1 and with λ(f ) injective (implicit

in [7]),

(iv) when X, µ = mX is a proﬁnite group, G y X by automorphisms, and G y X has a dense homoclinic

group (implicit in [6]).

Thus in cases (ii) − (iv), we have that for every closed, normal, G-invariant subgroup Y ⊆ X,

h(σi)i,µ(X/Y : X, G) = h(σi)i,top(X/Y : X, G).

Consequently, we will see in 1.4 that Theorem 1.1 recovers all previously known results on equality

of topological and measure-theoretic entropy in the nonamenable case.

In the ergodic case we can say

more about the entropy of G y (X, mX ) and show that the doubly-quenched model-measure soﬁc entropy

introduced in [1] agrees with the topological entropy and measure-theoretic entropy previously deﬁned in
[2],[14]. We use hdq

(σi)i,µ(X, G) for the doubly-quenched model-measure soﬁc entropy deﬁned in [1].

Theorem 1.3. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be

a compact, metrizable group with G y X by automorphisms. If G y (X, mX ) is ergodic and there exists a
sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) with µi →q mX , then

hdq
(σi)i,mX

(X, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X, G) = h(σi)i,top(X, G).

The above theorem says, under the assumption of ergodicity, once one knows the existence of some

sequence of measures which doubly quenched converge to the Haar measure, then we are able to promote

this sequence to a sequence of measures which doubly quenched converge to the Haar measure and have

good enough separation properties to compute the doubly-quenched entropy. We brieﬂy outline the proof.
Consider a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) which quenched converges to the Haar measure. One ﬁrst makes a minor
observation that our ergodicity assumption shows that under our assumptions we in fact have µi →dq mX

(this is because ergodicity and weak mixing are equivalent for actions on compact groups). We consider a
convolution of µi with the uniform measure of a well separated subset of Si ⊆ X di where each element of Si

is a good microstate for the topological entropy. As is typical with convolution arguments, this new sequence

inherits the good properties of each measure. This new sequence of measures has the separation properties

that uSi has and Austin’s results in [1] on behavior under products then shows that the convolution of

µi with the uniform measure of Si still doubly-quenched converges to the Haar measure. Using the good

separation properties of uSi and this doubly-quenched convergence allows us to show the equality of all the

entropies involved.

Using Proposition 1.2, we have the following corollary which reproves all previously known results regard-

ing equality of topological and measure-theoretic entropy for actions on compact groups. Moreover, we can

also equate these entropies to Austin’s doubly-quenched model-measure entropy.

Corollary 1.4. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be

a compact, metrizable group with G y X by automorphisms. Suppose that one of the following cases hold:

(i): X = Xf for some f ∈ Mm,n(Z(G)) with λ(f ) having dense image,

(ii): X = Xf for some f ∈ Mn(Z(G)) with λ(f ) injective,

(iii): X is a proﬁnite group and G y X has a dense homoclinic group,

then

hdq
(σi)i,mX

(X, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X, G) = h(σi)i,top(X, G).

The examples listed in Corollary 1.4 constitute many of the main examples where soﬁc entropy has been

computed and Corollary 1.4 computes the doubly-quenched model-measure soﬁc entropy introduced in [1]

for each of these examples. Hence this Corollary brings the computation of doubly-quenched model-measure

soﬁc entropy up to date with that of the entropy deﬁned by [14],[2]. Moreover we are able to do this in a

relatively painless manner without having to essentially reproduce the work in [7],[6],[14],[16],[3].

We make a few remarks about the organization of the paper. Section 2 reformulates Austin’s quenched

convergence and his doubly-quenched model-measure entropy so that one does not have to work with invariant

measures on a shift space, but only with invariant measures on a compact space. In this section, we also prove

Proposition 1.2 and explains how it implicitly follows from [2],[7],[6],[1]. In Section 3, we prove Theorems

1.1 and 1.3 (which are the main theorems in the paper). The proofs in this section are basically convolution

arguments combined with simple applications of Fubini’s theorem.

2. Reformulation of Doubly Quenched Convergence

In [1], Austin deﬁned the notion of quenched convergence for invariant measures of G y X G where G is a

countable, discrete group, X is a compact metrizable space and the action is by left shifts. In this section, we

explain how to modify the deﬁnition so that it works for invariant measures for an arbitrary action G y Y

where Y is any compact, metrizable space. We begin by recalling some necessary deﬁntions and notation.
For a set A and n ∈ N, we identify An with all functions {1, . . . , n} → A. For a ﬁnite set A, we use uA for
the uniform measure on A and if A = {1, . . . , n} for some n ∈ N we use un instead of u{1,...,n}. We use Sn
for the group of all bijections {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n}.

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G be a countable, discrete group. A sequence of maps σi : G → Sdi is said to be a soﬁc

approximation if:

• for every g, h ∈ G we have udi({j : σi(g)σi(h)(j) = σi(gh)(j)}) → 1,

• for every g ∈ G \ {e} we have udi({j : σi(g)(j) = j}) → 1.

We saythat G is soﬁc if it has a soﬁc approximation.

DOUBLY QUENCHED CONVERGENCE AND THE ENTROPY OF ALGEBRAIC ACTIONS OF SOFIC GROUPS

7

The ﬁrst item in the deﬁnition of soﬁc approximation may be thought of as saying that G has an “almost

action” on the ﬁnite set {1, . . . , di} (in the sense that the points on which the action axiom σi(gh)(j) =

σi(g)σi(h)(j) fails is neglible) the second item says that this action is “almost free.” Thus soﬁc groups may

be regarded as a pertubation of ﬁnite groups in the sense that ﬁnite groups are precisely the groups which

have free actions on ﬁnite sets.

We recall the deﬁnition of the topological and measure-theoretic microstates space. Suppose we are given

a countable, discrete group G and a compact, metrizable space X with G y X by homeomorphisms. A

pseudometric ρ on X is said to be dynamically generating if for all x 6= y with x, y ∈ X there is a g ∈ G
with ρ(gx, gy) > 0. If ρ is as above and n ∈ N, we deﬁne ρ2 on X n by

ρ2(x, y)2 =

1
n

nXj=1

ρ(x(j), y(j))2.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let G be a countable, discrete, sofc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Suppose

that X is a compact, metrizable space with G y X by homeomoprhisms and let ρ be a dynamically
generating pseudometric. For ﬁnite F ⊆ G and δ > 0 we let Map(ρ, F, δ, σi) be all φ ∈ X di so that

ρ2(gφ, φ ◦ σi(g)) < δ.

We think of Map(ρ, F, δ, σi) as a space of “topological microstates” in the sense that φ ∈ Map(ρ, F, δ, σi)

gives a ﬁnitary model of G y X (i.e.

it is approximately equivariant with approximate being measured

in the topology on X.) Let X be a compact, metrizable space. We use Prob(X) for the space of Borel

probability measures on X. For a ﬁnite L ⊆ C(X) and δ > 0, set

UL,δ(µ) = \f∈L

(cid:26)ν ∈ Prob(X) :(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ZX

f dµ −ZX

f dν(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) < δ(cid:27) .

Note that UL,δ(µ) ranging over all L, δ gives a basis of neighborhoods of µ in the weak-∗ topology on Prob(X).

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let G be a countable, discrete, sofc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Suppose

that X is a compact, metrizable space with G y X by homeomoprhisms and let ρ be a dynamically

generating pseudometric. For ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(X) and δ > 0, set

Mapµ(ρ, F, L, δ, σi) = {φ ∈ Map(ρ, F, δ, σi) : φ∗(udi) ∈ UL,δ(µ)}.

We think of Map(ρ, F, L, δ, σi) as a space of “measure-theoretic microstates” for G y (X, µ).

Given a compact, metrizable space X and a countable discrete group with G y X by homeomorphisms,

we let ProbG(X) be the set of all µ ∈ Prob(X) which are G-invariant.

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let G be a countable, discrete, sofc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let

X be a compact, metrizable space with GyX by homeomorphisms and let ρ be a dynamically generating
pseudometric on X. We say that a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) quenched converges to µ ∈ ProbG(X) if for all

ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(X) and δ > 0, we have

µi(cid:0)Mapµ(ρ, F, L, δ, σi)(cid:1) → 1,

We give a proposition which states a few equivalent ways to say that a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) quenched

converges to µ. This proof is simple and is left to the reader, we will not actually need it in this paper and

mainly state it to give the reader added intuition as to the signﬁcance of quenched convergence. Let X be
a set and n ∈ N, for 1 ≤ j ≤ n we deﬁne Ej : X n → X by Ej (x) = x(j).

Proposition 2.5. Let G be a countable, discrete, sofc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let

X be a compact, metrizable space with GyX by homeomorphisms and ﬁx a µ ∈ ProbG(X). Suppose that
µi ∈ Prob(X di). Fix a dynamically generating pseudometric ρ on X. The following are equivalent:

(i) µi →q µ,

(ii) For any neighborhood O of µ in the weak-∗ topology and for any neighborhood V of the diagonal in

X × X and any g ∈ G we have

udi({j : (Ej )∗µ ∈ O}) → 1,

µi({x : x∗(udi) ∈ O}) → 1,

µi ⊗ udi({(x, j) : (gx(j), x(σi(g)(j)) ∈ V}) → 1.

(iii) For any neighborhood O of µ in the weak-∗ topology and for any g ∈ G we have

udi({j : (Ej )∗µ ∈ O}) → 1,

µi({x : x∗(udi) ∈ O}) → 1,

Z ρ(gx(j), x(σi(g)(j))) dµi ⊗ udi(x, j) → 0.

A priori the deﬁnition of quenched convergence depends upon a choice of dynamically generating pseu-

dometric (the preceding proposition actually shows independence but we will give a diﬀerent proof). We

will ignore this because we will show that our deﬁnition of doubly quenched convergence agrees with that

of [1].

It is clear that the deﬁnition of quenched (resp. doubly quenched convergence) given in [1] only

depends upon the topology of X, but in Corollary 5.18 of [1] it is in fact shown that it only depends upon

the measure-theoretic nature of G y (X, µ). We now restate the deﬁnition of doubly quenched convergence

deﬁned in [1]. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group G with a soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. For
x ∈ X di we deﬁne φx : {1, . . . , di} → X G by

(φx(j))(g) = x(σi(g)−1(j)), for 1 ≤ j ≤ di, g ∈ G.

Deﬁnition 2.6 ([1] Deﬁnition 5.3). Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation
σi : G → Sdi. Let X be a compact, metrizable, space and GyX G the left shift action given by (gx)(h) =
x(g−1h). Fix a µ ∈ ProbG(X G). We say that a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) quenched converges to µ (in the
sense of [1]) if given any neighborhood O of µ in the weak∗ topology on Prob(X G) we have

µi({x : (φx)∗(udi) ∈ O}) → 1,

udi ({j : (Ej )∗(µi) ∈ O}) → 1.

We show that our notion of doubly quenched convergence is related to that of [1]. We need the following

lemma (which will also be used later).

Lemma 2.7. Let G be a countable discrete soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be a

compact, metrizable space with GyX by homeomorphisms and ρ a dynamically generating pseudometric on
X. Let Ψ : X → X G be the map deﬁned by Ψ(x)(g) = g−1x.

(i): For any neigbhorhood O of Ψ∗(µ) in the weak-∗ topology on Prob(X G), there exists ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆
C(X) and δ > 0 so that for all suﬃciently large i and all x ∈ Mapµ(ρ, F, L, δ, σi) we have (φx)∗(udi) ∈ O.
(ii): Given any ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(X) and δ > 0, there is a neighborhood O of Ψ∗(µ) in the
weak∗-topology so that if i is suﬃciently large, then for every x ∈ X di with (φx)∗(udi) ∈ O, we have
x ∈ Mapµ(ρ, F, δ, L, σi).

Proof. (i): For g ∈ G, let ιg : C(X) → C(X G) be the map deﬁned by ιg(f )(x) = f (x(g)). Let E ⊆ G be
ﬁnite, let (fg)g∈E ∈ C(X)E and ε > 0 be given. It is enough to handle the case that

(cid:3)

Because of the above lemma, and the fact that context will make it clear which soﬁc approximation we
are using, if σi, X, µi are as in the theorem we use µi →q µ to mean that µi quenched converges to µ in the

sense of Deﬁnition 2.4. By the results in [1], it follows that the existence of a sequence of measures which

quenched converge to µ is independent of the topological model. Note that Lemma 2.8 implies an obvious

analogue of Lemma 2.8 for doubly quenched convergence. By the results of [1], it follows that existence of

a sequence of meaures which doubly quenched converge to µ is independent of the topological model and is

preserved under measure-theoretic factor maps.

We reformulate a few of the results from [1] in our framework. Given sets X, Y a natural number n, and

φ ∈ X n, ψ ∈ Y n, we deﬁne φ ⊗ ψ ∈ (X × Y )n by (φ ⊗ ψ)(x, y) = (φ(x), ψ(y)).

Corollary 2.9. Let G be a countable discrete soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be a

compact, metrizable space with GyX by homeomorphisms and ρ a dynamically generating pseudometric on

X. Fix a µ ∈ ProbG(X).

(i) Suppose that µi ∈ Prob(X di) and µi →dq µ. Let Y be a compact, metrizable space, let G y Y by
homeomorphisms and let ν ∈ ProbG(X). Then for any dynamically generating pseudometrics ρ′, ρ on
X × Y, Y and for any ﬁnite F ′ ⊆ G, L′ ⊆ C(X × Y ) and δ′ > 0, there exists ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(Y )

and a δ > 0 so that

and that for any weak-∗ neigbhorhood O of µ in Prob(X) we have

then µi →q µ. If in addition G y (X, µ) is weakly mixing, then µi →dq µ.

udi({j : (Ej )∗µi ∈ O}) → 1,

Proof. Once we know Lemmas 2.8 and 2.7 these all follows from some of the main results in [1]. Speciﬁcally,

part (i) follows from Theorem A of [1] and part (ii) follows from Corollary 5.7 and Lemma 5.15 of [1].

For later use we also give the following reformulation of Austin’s dq-entropy. Let X be a compact,

metrizable space, let ρ be a continuous pseudometric on X and µ ∈ Prob(X). We let Sε,δ(µ, ρ) be the

smallest cardinality of A ⊆ X whose ε-neighborhood with respect to ρ has µ-measure at least 1 − δ. We

remark that the roles of ε, δ are switched in page 7 of [1], we have elected to do this to stay close the notation

in [13].

Deﬁnition 2.10. Let G be a countable discrete soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X

be a compact metrizable space, let G y X by homemorphisms and ﬁx a µ ∈ ProbG(X). Suppose that din
is a subsequence of di and that µin ∈ Prob(X di) have µin →dq µ. Set

Proposition 2.12. Let G be a countable discrete soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation Σ = (σi : G → Sdi).

Let X be a compact metrizable space, let G y X by homemorphisms and ﬁx a µ ∈ ProbG(X). The doubly-
quenched entropy hdq
(σi)i,µ(ρ) as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.10 agrees with hΣ(µ) as deﬁned in Section 6 of [1].
Hence hdq

(σi)i,µ(ρ) does not depend upon the dynamically generating pseudometric.

Because of the preceding proposition we will use hdq

(σi)i,µ(X, G) instead of hdq

(σi)i,µ(ρ) whenever ρ is a

dynamically generating pseudometric on X.

We will show in Section 3 that the existence of a sequence which doubly quenched converges to the

Haar measure implies equality of topological and meausre-theoretic entropy for actions by automorphisms

on compact groups. In order to illustrate the beneﬁt of these results, we close this section by giving many

examples of actions on compact groups which have measures which doubly quenched converges to the Haar

measure. In order to prove these results, we need to know the following simple fact about weak mixing for

actions on compact groups. This fact is well-known and we only include the proof for completeness. For

Hilbert spaces H, K we use B(H, K) for the space of bounded, linear operators H → K. For a Hilbert space

H, we use U(H) for the unitary operators on H. Given a countable, discrete group G and Hilbert spaces

H, K and two representations π : G → U(H), ρ : G → U(K), we set

Hom(π, ρ) = {T ∈ B(H, K) : T π(g) = ρ(g)T for all g ∈ G}.

Lemma 2.13. Let G be a countable, discrete group and let X be a compact, metrizable group with GyX

by continuous automorphisms. If Gy(X, mX ) is ergodic, then Gy(X, mX ) is weakly mixing.

Proof. For g ∈ G, we use αg for the action of g on X. We prove that Gy(X × X, mX ⊗ mX) is ergodic. If this

is not the case, then by [20] Lemma 1.2 we can ﬁnd a nontrivial irreducible representation π : X × X → U(H)
for some ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space H so that Gπ = {g ∈ G : π ◦ αg ∼= π} has ﬁnite index in G. By [15]
Proposition 2.3.23, we may write H = H1 ⊗H2 for Hilbert space Hj , j = 1, 2 and we may ﬁnd representations

πj : G → U(Hj ), j = 1, 2 so that

π(x, y) = π1(x) ⊗ π2(y).

Since π is not trivial, we have that one of π1, π2 is not trivial. Without loss of generality, we assume that π1

is not trivial. Suppose g ∈ Gπ and let U ∈ U(H1 ⊗ H2) be such that

π(x, y) = U∗π(αg(x), αg(y))U for all (x, y) ∈ X × X.

For ζ, ζ′ ∈ H2, deﬁne Uζ,ζ′ ∈ B(H1) by

hUζ,ζ′(ξ), ξ′i = hU (ξ ⊗ ζ), ξ′ ⊗ ζ′i.

Since U is a unitary, we may ﬁx a choice of ζ, ζ′ so that Uζ,ζ′ 6= 0. We have that Uζ,ζ′ ∈ Hom(π1, π1 ◦ αg).

By Schur’s Lemma we have

So there is a c ∈ C with

U∗ζ,ζ′Uζ,ζ′ ∈ Hom(π1, π1) = C id .

U∗ζ,ζ′Uζ,ζ′ = c id .

16

BEN HAYES

Note that we must have that c is a positive real number. It follows that by rescaling Uζ,ζ′ by 1√c gives us an
isometric, equivariant map isomorphism π1 ∼= π1 ◦ αg and this proves that Gπ ⊆ {g ∈ G : π1 ◦ αg ∼= π1}. By
[20] Lemma 1.2 it follows that Gy(X, mX ) is not ergodic, a contradiction.

(cid:3)

Corollary 2.14. Suppose that G is a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi.

Let X be a compact, metrizable group with GyX by automorphisms. If Gy(X, mX ) is ergodic and µi ∈
Prob(X di) with µi →q µ, then µi →dq µ.

Proof. This is a simple combination of Lemma 2.13 and Corollary 2.9.

(cid:3)

We can now list many examples of actions on compact groups which have a sequence of measures which

doubly quenched converge to the Haar measure. Recall that if X is a compact, metrizable group and G is a

countable, discrete group with G y X by automorphisms, then the homoclinic group of G y X is deﬁned

by

∆(X, G) = {x ∈ X :

gx = 1}.

lim
g→∞

Proposition 2.15. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. The

following actions have nonnegative lower doubly quenched entropy:

(i) Bernoulli shifts actions of G,

(ii) G y (X, mX ) where X is a proﬁnite group, the action is by continuous automorphisms and G y X

has a dense homoclinic group,

(iii) G y (Xf , mXf ) where f ∈ Mm,n(Z(G)) is such that λ(f )(ℓ2(G)⊕n) is dense,
(iv) G y (Xf , mXf ) where f ∈ Mn(Z(G)) is such that λ(f ) is injective.

Proof. (i): This is implicitly due to Bowen in [2] (see the proof of Theorem 8.1 therein) and was shown

explicitly by Austin (see Lemma 5.11 of [1]).

(ii): It is known that density of the homoclinic group implies that G y (X, mX ) is ergodic (see e.g.

Theorem 4.1 of [16]). So by Corollary 2.14, it is enough to shown that G y (X, mX) has nonnegative lower

quenched entropy and this is implicit in the proof of Theorem 8.2 of [6].

(iii): By the arguments of [11], we know that G y (Xf , mXf ) is ergodic. It is implicit in the proof of
f ) with

Theorem 5.9 of [7] that the G y (Xf , mXf ) that there is a sequence of measures µi ∈ Prob(X di
µi →q mXf , so applying Corollary 2.14 completes the proof.

(iv) From the rank-nullity theorem for von Neumann dimension (see [19] Lemma 1.13) we know that λ(f )

is injective if and only if λ(f ) has dense image for f ∈ Mn(Z(G)).

3. Equalilty of Topological and Measure-Theoretic Entropy

To prove the equality of topological and measure-theoretic entropy we will need a convolution argument

for which we establish the following preliminary (and well-known) fact.

Lemma 3.1. Let X be a compact, metrizable group. Given a neighorhood O in Prob(X) of mX in the
weak∗-topology, there is a neighborhood V of Prob(X) of mX in the weak∗ topology so that µ ∗ ν ∈ O for all

µ ∈ V, ν ∈ Prob(X).

Proof. Since Prob(X) is compact, and µ ∗ mX = mX for any µ ∈ Prob(X), to prove the Lemma it is enough
to show that convolution is continuous in both variables in the weak∗-topology. Let p : X × X → X be the

multiplication map: p(x, y) = xy. Then

As the maps

µ ∗ ν = p∗(µ ⊗ ν).

Prob(X) × Prob(X) → Prob(X × X), (µ, ν) 7→ µ ⊗ ν,

Prob(X × X) → Prob(X), ζ 7→ p∗ζ

are continuous in the weak∗-topology, it follows that the map (µ, ν) 7→ µ ∗ ν is continuous in the weak∗-

topology.

(cid:3)

The following Lemma contains the main convolution argument we will need to establish Theorem 1.1. If

X is a compact group and φ, ψ ∈ X n for some n ∈ N, we deﬁne φψ ∈ X n by φψ(j) = φ(j)ψ(j).

Lemma 3.2. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be a
compact, metrizable, group with GyX by continuous automorphisms. Let µi ∈ Prob(X di) with µi →dq mX .

Let ρ be a dynamically generating pseudometric on X. Then, for any ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(X) and δ, ε > 0,
there is a F ′ ⊆ G and δ′ > 0 and an I ∈ N so that for any i > I and any ψ ∈ Map(ρ, F ′, δ′, σi) we have

µi({φ : ψφ ∈ MapmX (ρ, F, L, δ, σi)}) ≥ 1 − ε.

Proof. Fix ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(X) and δ, ε > 0. Let F ′n be an increasing sequence of ﬁnite subsets of G
whose union is G and let δ′n be a decreasing sequence of positive real numbers converging to 0. If the claim
is false, then we can ﬁnd an increasing sequence of integers in → ∞ and a ψin ∈ Map(ρ, F ′n, δ′n, σin ) so that

Passing to a subsequence we may assume that

Let p : X × X → X be the multiplication map p(x, y) = xy. Let L′ = {f ◦ m : f ∈ L}. Let eρ be the metric

By continuity of the map p, we may ﬁnd a δ′ > 0 and ﬁnite L′ ⊆ C(X), F ′ ⊆ G so that if Φ ∈

Mapν⊗mX (eρ, F, L′, δ′, σin ), then p ◦ Φ ∈ MapmX (ρ, F, L, δ, σi). By Corollary 2.9 (i) we have that for all

large n,

Our choice of F ′, L′, δ′ imply that

µin ({φ : ψin ⊗ φ ∈ Mapν⊗mX (eρ, F ′, L′, δ′, σin )}) ≥ 1 − ε.

µin ({φ : ψin φ ∈ MapmX (ρ, F, L, δ, σin )}) ≥ 1 − ε

a contradiction.

(cid:3)

We now proceed to showing that topological soﬁc entropy and measure-theoretic soﬁc entropy agree if
there is a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di) so that µi →dq mX . We recall the deﬁnition of topological entropy in

the presence. This was deﬁned in [18] Deﬁnition 9.3 under the name “entropy relative to an extension,” we

will use the term entropy in the presence to coincide with the terminology set out in [9] Deﬁnition 2.7.

Let (X, d) be a pseudometric space. For A, B ⊆ X and δ > 0 we say that A is δ-contained in B and write

A ⊆δ B if for every a ∈ A, there is a b ∈ B with d(a, b) < δ. We say that A ⊆ X is δ-dense if X ⊆δ A. We
say that A ⊆ X is δ-separated if for all a 6= a′ with a, a′ ∈ A we have d(a, a′) > δ. We let Sδ(X, d) be the

smallest cardinality of a δ-subset of X and Nδ(X, d) be the largest cardinality of a δ-separated subset of X.

Note that

Sδ(X, d) ≤ Nδ(X, d) ≤ Sδ/2(X, d).

Deﬁnition 3.3 (Deﬁnition 9.3 in [18]). Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation

σi : G → Sdi. Let X be a compact, metrizable space with GyX by homeomorphisms. Let GyY be a

topological factor with factor map π : X → Y (i.e. GyY by homeomorphisms and π is a G-equivariant

surjective map). Let ρX , ρY be dynamically generating pseudometrics on Y, X respectively. For a ﬁnite

F ⊆ G and δ > 0 we set

We deﬁne

Map(Y : ρX , F, δ, σi) = {π ◦ φ : φ ∈ Map(ρX , F, δ, σi)}.

h(σi)i,top(ρY : ρX , ε).

Note that if Y = X with factor map id, then this is just the topological entropy. We also recall the

formulation of measure-theoretic entropy in the presence we formulated in [9].

Deﬁnition 3.4 (Deﬁnition 2.7 in [9]). Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation

σi : G → Sdi. Let X be a compact, metrizable space with GyX by homeomorphisms and ﬁx a µ ∈ ProbG(X).

Let GyY be a topological factor with factor map π : X → Y (i.e. GyY by homeomorphisms and π is a
G-equivariant surjective map) and set ν = π∗µ. Let ρX , ρY be dynamically generating pseudometrics on
Y, X respectively. For ﬁnite F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(X) and δ > 0 we set

Mapµ(Y : ρX , F, L, δ, σi) = {π ◦ φ : φ ∈ Mapµ(ρX , F, L, δ, σi)}.

We deﬁne

h(σi)i,µ(ρY : ρX , F, L, δ, ε) = lim sup

i→∞

h(σi)i,µ(Y : X, G) = sup
ε>0

h(σi)i,µ(ρY : ρX , ε).

Again if Y = X with factor map id, this is just the measure-theoretic entropy. Recall that if X is a

compact group then it has a compatible bi-invariant metric (i.e. there is a metric d on X giving the topology

and such that d(axb, ayb) = d(x, y) for all a, b, x, y ∈ X).

Theorem 3.5. Let G be a countable, discrete group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be

a compact, metrizable group with GyX by continuous automorphisms. Suppose that there exists µi ∈
Prob(X di) with µi →dq mX . Let Y be a closed, normal, G-invariant subgroup of X, then

h(σi),top(X/Y : X, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X/Y : X, G).

Proof. We use the formulation of entropy in the presence given in [9] (see Deﬁnition 2.7 and Theorem 2.10).
By assumption we may ﬁnd a µi ∈ Prob(X di) with µi →dq mX . Fix compatible bi-invariant metrics ρX , ρX/Y
on X, X/Y. Let π : X → X/Y be the quotient map. It is clear that

h(σi),top(X/Y : X, G) ≥ h(σi)i,mX (X/Y : X, G).

For the reverse inequality, ﬁx ε, δ > 0 and F ⊆ G, L ⊆ C(X) ﬁnite. By Lemma 3.2 we may ﬁnd a δ′ > 0 and
ﬁnite F ′ ⊆ G so that for every ψ ∈ Map(ρ, F ′, δ′, σi) we have

µi({φ : ψφ ∈ MapmX (ρ, F, L, δ, σi)}) ≥ 1 − ε.

Choose a S ⊆ Map(ρ, F ′, δ′, σi) so that ρ2(π ◦ ψ, π ◦ ψ′) ≥ ε for ψ, ψ′ ∈ S with ψ 6= ψ′ and such that

|S| = Nε(Map(X/Y : ρX , F ′, δ′, σi), ρ2).

By Fubini’s theorem we then have

uS ⊗ µi({(ψ, φ) : ψφ ∈ Map(ρX , F, L, δ, σi)}) ≥ 1 − ε.

20

BEN HAYES

By Fubini’s theorem again we may ﬁnd a φ ∈ X di so that

uS({ψ : ψφ ∈ Map(ρX , F, L, δ, σi)}) ≥ 1 − ε.

Let

For ψ, ψ′ ∈ S0 with ψ 6= ψ′ translation-invariance of ρX/Y implies that:

S0 = {ψ : ψφ ∈ Map(ρX , F, L, δ, σi)}.

ρ2,X/Y ((π ◦ ψ)(π ◦ φ), (π ◦ ψ′)(π ◦ φ)) = ρ2,X/Y (π ◦ ψ, π ◦ ψ′) ≥ ε.

Hence

Nε(MapmX (X/Y : ρX , F, L, δ, σi), ρ2,X/Y ) ≥ |S0| ≥ (1−ε)|S| = (1−ε)Nε(Map(X/Y : ρX , F ′, δ′, σi), ρ2,X/Y ).

It follows that

h(σi)i,mX (ρX/Y : ρX , F, L, δ, ε) ≥ h(σi)i(ρX/Y : ρX , F ′, δ′, ε) ≥ h(σi)i(ρX/Y : ρX , ε).

Inﬁmizing over F, L, δ proves that

h(σi)i,mX (ρX/Y : ρX , ε) ≥ h(σi)i (ρX/Y : ρX , ε).

Taking the supremum over all ε > 0 completes the proof.

A special case is when Y = {1} which gives us the following (compare [6] Theorem 8.2).

Corollary 3.6. Let G be a countable, discrete group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be

a compact, metrizable group with GyX by continuous automorphisms. Suppose that there exists µi ∈
Prob(X di) with µi →dq mX , then

(cid:3)

h(σi),top(X, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X, G).

In the ergodic case we can see even more, due to the following lemma.

Lemma 3.7. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be a

compact, metrizable, group with GyX by automrophisms. Assume that G y (X, mX ) is ergodic. Suppose
that µi ∈ Prob(X di) with µi →q mX . Suppose that νi ∈ Prob(X di) is such that for all F ⊆ G ﬁnite and

δ > 0 we have

Then νi ∗ µi →dq mX .

νi(Map(ρ, F, δ, σi)) → 1.

Proof. Let ρ be a bi-invariant metric on X. By Corollary 2.14 we know that µi →dq mX . For 1 ≤ j ≤ di we

have

(Ej )∗(νi ∗ µi) = (Ej)∗(νi) ∗ (Ej)∗µi.

DOUBLY QUENCHED CONVERGENCE AND THE ENTROPY OF ALGEBRAIC ACTIONS OF SOFIC GROUPS

21

Hence, for any neighborhood O in Prob(X) of mX in the weak∗-topology Lemma 3.1 implies that

Fix a ﬁnite F ⊆ G and a δ > 0. We have

udi({j : (Ej)∗(νi ∗ µi) ∈ O}) → 1.

(νi ∗ µi)(Map(ρ, F, δ, σi)) = νi ⊗ µi({(φ, ψ) : φψ ∈ Map(ρ, F, δ, σi)}).

By bi-invariance of ρ we have for any g ∈ G

ρ2((φ · ψ) ◦ σi(g), g(φ · ψ)) ≤ ρ2(φ ◦ σi(g), gφ) + ρ2(ψ ◦ σi(g), gψ).

Thus

(νi ∗ µi)(Map(ρ, F, δ, σi)) ≥ νi(Map(ρ, F, δ/2, σi))µi(Map(ρ, F, δ/2, σi)) → 1

and the lemma now follows from Corollary 2.9 (ii).

We now relate, in the erogdic case, the topological entropy due to Kerr-Li, the measure-theoretic entropy

due to Bowen, Kerr-Li and the doubly-quenched entropy due to Austin.

Theorem 3.8. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be

a compact, metrizable, group with GyX by automrophisms. Assume that G y (X, mX ) is ergodic and that
there exists µi ∈ Prob(X di) and µi →q mX . Then

hdq
(σi)i,mX

(X, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X, G) = h(σi)i,top(X, G).

(cid:3)

Proof. Let ρ be a bi-invariant metric on X. It is enough to show that h(σi)i,top(X, G) ≤ hdq
an increasing sequence of ﬁnite subsets Fn of G whose union is G and let δn be a decreasing sequence of

(X, G). Fix

(σi)i,mX

positive real numbers tending to zero. Fix ε > 0. Find a strictly increasing sequence in of natural numbers

with

1
din

log Nε(Map(ρ, Fn, δn, σin ), ρ2) ≥ −2−n + h(σi)i (ρ, ε/2).

Let Sin be an ε
3.7 we have that

2 -separated subset of Map(ρ, Fn, δn, σin ) with respect to ρ2 of maximal cardinality. By Lemma

uSin ∗ µin →dq mX .

Fix ε, δ > 0 and suppose that Ai ⊆ X din has uSin ∗ µin (A) ≥ 1 − δ. Note that

uSin ∗ µin (A) = uSin ⊗ µin ({(φ, ψ) : φψ ∈ A}.

Hence we may ﬁnd a ψ ∈ X di so that

uSin ({φ : φψ ∈ A}) ≥ 1 − δ.

Let S0

in = {φ : φψ ∈ A}, by bi-invariance of ρ we have that S0

in ψ is ε

2 -separated and contained in A. So

Sε(A, ρ2) ≥ Nε/2(A, ρ2) ≥ |S0

in | ≥ (1 − δ)Nε/2(Map(ρ, Fn, δn, σin ), ρ2).

22

BEN HAYES

So we have shown that

Sε,δ(uSin ∗ µin , ρ2) ≥ (1 − δ)Nε/2(Map(ρ, Fn, δn, σin ), ρ2) ≥ exp(din (−2−n) + din h(σi)i (ρ, ε/2)).

We thus have that

Taking the supremum over ε, δ > 0 completes the proof.

lim sup
n→∞

1
din

log Sε,δ(uSin ∗ µin , ρ2) ≥ h(σi)i (ρ, ε/2).

We now close with a concrete list of actions for which measure-theoretic (as deﬁned either by Bowen,

Kerr-Li or by Austin) and topological entropy agree.

Corollary 3.9. Let G be a countable, discrete, soﬁc group with soﬁc approximation σi : G → Sdi. Let X be

a compact, metrizable, group with GyX by automrophisms. Suppose that one of the following cases hold:

(cid:3)

(i) X = Xf for some f ∈ Mn(Z(G)) with λ(f ) injective,

(ii) X is a proﬁnite group and Gy(X, mX ) has a dense homoclinic group,

then

hdq
(σi)i,mX

(X, G) = h(σi)i,mX (X, G) = h(σi)i,top(X, G).

Proof. We saw in Proposition 2.15 that each of these actions is ergodic and has a sequence µi ∈ Prob(X di)
with µi →q mX , so this follows from Theorem 3.8.
