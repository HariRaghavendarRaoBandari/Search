1. Introduction

1.1. Overview. In the seminal paper [21], M. Struwe obtained a very useful global compactness
result for Palais-Smale sequences of the energy functional

in the sense that critical points of I are weak solutions of (1.1). Due to the presence of the
term with critical growth in its deﬁnition, the functional I does not satisfy the Palais-Smale
condition. In other words, sequences {un}n∈N ⊂ D1,2

bounded energy are not necessarily precompact in D1,2
0 (Ω). Struwe’s result gives a precise
description of what happens when compactness fails at an energy level c. Roughly speaking, in
this case there exists a (possibly trivial) solution v0 to (1.1) and k proﬁles vk solving solving the
purely critical problem on the whole space

(1.2)
such that the sequence {un}n∈N can be “almost” written as a superposition of v0, . . . , vk. More
precisely, there exist {zi

This kind of result is very useful to study the existence of ground states for nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equations, Yamabe-type equations or various classes of minimization problems.

Since then, several extensions of Struwe’s result appeared in the literature for semi-linear
elliptic problems. We refer the reader to [12, Lemma 5] for the case of the bilaplacian operator
∆2 with both Navier or Dirichlet boundary conditions and to [18, Theorem 1.1] for nonlocal
problems involving the fractional Laplacian (−∆)s for s ∈ (0, 1). However, the linearity of the
operator does not seem essential in the derivation of this type of results. In fact in [16, Theorem
1.2] (see also [1, 25]) a similar result was obtained for signed Palais-Smale sequences of the
functional associated with the problem

(−∆pu + a |u|p−2 u = µ |u|p∗−2 u in Ω

u = 0

on ∂Ω,

where a ∈ LN/p(Ω), µ > 0, ∆p is the p−Laplacian operator and p∗ = N p/(N − p).

Applications of these results are provided to constrained minimization problems, to Br´ezis–
Nirenberg type problems (see [16]) and to Bahri–Coron type problems (see [15]), namely the
existence of positive solutions to the purely critical problem

−∆pu = µ |u|p∗−2u,

in Ω,

when the domain Ω has a nontrivial topology. For the aforementioned results in the semi-linear
case p = 2, we also refer to the monograph [24].

1.2. Main results. Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1). The aim of this paper is to obtain a
global compactness result for Palais-Smale sequences of the C 1 nonlocal energy functional I :

that {un}n∈N ⊂ Ds,p

(NA) Nonexistence Assumption. If H is a half-space, then (1.7) has the trivial solution

Our main result is the following

Theorem 1.1. We assume hypothesis (NA). Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1) be such that
s p < N . Let Ω ⊂ RN be an open bounded set with smooth boundary. Let {un}n∈N ⊂ Ds,p
0 (Ω) be
a Palais-Smale sequence at level c for the functional I deﬁned in (1.4).

Then there exist:

• a (possibly trivial) solution v0 ∈ Ds,p

0 (Ω) of

(−∆)s

p u + a |u|p−2 u = µ |u|p∗

• a number k ∈ N and v1, v2 · · · , vk ∈ Ds,p

for a constant C = C(N, p) > 0, original Struwe’s result formally corresponds to p = 2 and s = 1
in Theorem 1.1.

Remark 1.2 (About the Nonexistence Assumption). The nonexistence of solutions to prob-
lem (1.7) for half-spaces is already changelling in the local case, for p 6= 2. Indeed, without sign
hypothesis on the solution, this is still open for the p−Laplacian. The situation is made unclear
due to absence of a suitable Pohoˇzaev type identity for p 6= 2, as well as of a unique continuation
result up to the boundary. On the contrary, if we assume solutions to have constant sign, in
the local case then this has been proved in [16, Theorem 1.1]. For 0 < s < 1 and p = 2, the
non-existence of signed continuous solutions was obtained in [10, Corollary 1.6].

Next we formulate the global compactness result for radially symmetric functions in a ball
B ⊂ RN . Due to the geometric restrictions, the ﬁnal outcome is more precise and free of
Assumption (NA).

Theorem 1.3 (Radial case). Let N ≥ 2, 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1) be such that s p < N . Let
B ⊂ RN be a ball centered at the origin and assume that a ∈ LN/sp
0,rad(B)
be a Palais-Smale sequence for I at level c. Then there exist:

rad (B). Let {un}n∈N ⊂ Ds,p

• a (possibly trivial) solution v0 ∈ Ds,p

0,rad(B) of

(−∆)s

and conclusions (1.9) and (1.10).

Remark 1.4 (Radial case for N = 1). The previous results guarantees that, under the standing
assumptions, a radial Palais-Smale sequence can concentrate only at the origin. This is due to
the fact that functions in Ds,p
0,rad verify some extra compactness properties on annular regions
AR0,R1 = {x : R0 < |x| < R1}, which go up to the exponent p∗
s (and even beyond). More
precisely, we have compactness of the embeddings
0,rad(B) ֒→ Lq(AR0,R1),

s ≤ q < p#
p∗
s ,

Ds,p

s is the critical Sobolev exponent in dimension N = 1. As for N = 1 we have p∗

s = p#
where p#
s ,
compactness ceases to be true for s p < N = 1 (see Proposition 4.1 and Remark 4.2). In the
one-dimensional case, in Theorem 1.3 one would need (NA) as above.

GLOBAL COMPACTNESS FOR NONLOCAL PROBLEMS

We point out that, contrary to [16, 24], on the weight function a we merely assume it to be
in LN/sp(Ω), avoiding an additional coercivity assumption (see [24, condition (B), p.125]) which
was used in [16, 24] to get the boundedness of the Palais-Smale sequence {un}n∈N.

The proof by Struwe in [21] is essentially based upon iterated rescaling arguments, jointly with
an extension procedure to show the non-triviality of the weak limits. The latter seems hard to
adapt to the nonlocal cases, namely when s > 0 is not integer. Thus we prove Theorem 1.1
by basically following the scheme of Clapp’s paper [7]. A delicate point will be proving that
the weak limits appearing in the construction are non-trivial. As a main ingredient, we use a
Caccioppoli inequality for solutions of (−∆)s

pu = f (see Proposition 2.9 below).

Remark 1.5 (The case p = 2). In the Hilbertian setting, namely for p = 2 and 0 < s < N/2,
Theorem 1.1 has been recently proved in [18] by appealing to the so-called proﬁle decomposition
of Gerard, see [13]. The latter is a general result describing the compactness defects of general
bounded sequences in Ds,2
0 (RN ), which are not necessarily Palais-Smale sequences of some energy
functional. See also [17, Theorem 1.4], where some improved fractional Sobolev embeddings are
obtained. We point out that for p 6= 2 such an approach does not seem feasible. Indeed, the paper
[14] suggests that the decomposition (1.8) should not be expected for a generic bounded sequence
in Ds,p
0 (RN ) (see [14, page 387]). We also observe that some form of the global compactness
result of [18] was also derived in [20] in the study of Coron-type results in the fractional case.

Remark 1.6. We also consider a version of the above theorem stated for Palais-Smale sequences
with sign, namely Palais-Smale sequences {un}n∈N with the additional property that the negative
parts {(un)−}n∈N converges to zero in Lp∗
s . This is particularly interesting if c is a minimax
type level (i.e. with mountain pass, saddle point or linking geometry). Indeed, in this case it is
often possible to obtain a Palais-Smale sequence with sign at level c via deformation arguments
of Critical Point Theory, see [24, Theorem 2.8].

1.3. Notations. For 1 < p < ∞ we consider the monotone function Jp : RN → RN deﬁned by

Jp(ξ) := |ξ|p−2 ξ,

ξ ∈ RN .

We recall that this satisﬁes

(1.12)

|Jp(ξ) − Jp(η)| ≤

|ξ − η|p−1,

if 1 < p ≤ 2,

Cp (|ξ| + |η|)p−2 |ξ − η|,

if p > 2.

We denote by Br(x0) the N −dimensional open ball of radius r, centered at a point x0 ∈ RN .
The symbol k · kLp(Ω) stands for the standard norm for the Lp(Ω) space. For a measurable
function u : RN → R, we let

[u]Ds,p(RN ) :=(cid:18)ˆR2N

|u(x) − u(y)|p

|x − y|N +sp dxdy(cid:19)1/p

be its Gagliardo seminorm. For s p < N , we consider the space

2.1. Br´ezis-Lieb type properties. We ﬁrst recall the following result (see [6, Theorem 1]
and [16, Lemma 3.2]).

2. Preliminary results

The previous result implies the following splitting properties.

Lemma 2.3. Let a ∈ LN/sp(Ω), assume that {un}n∈N is bounded in Lp∗
almost everywhere in Ω. Then

s (Ω) and that un → u

Proof. Let us set

and

It is not diﬃcult to see that {φn}n∈N is bounded in Lσ/(σ−1)(Ω) and converges to 0 almost

and the last limit is zero. Indeed, by Young inequality and Fatou Lemma for every 0 < τ ≪ 1,

and by the arbitrariness of τ > 0, we get the conclusion.

Next we produce a Palais-Smale sequence for I∞ from a Palais-Smale sequence for I.
Lemma 2.4. Let {un}n∈N ⊂ Ds,p
that

0 (Ω) be a Palais-Smale sequence for I at the level c. Assume

un ⇀ u in Ds,p

un → u a. e. in Ω.
(2.2)
Then, passing if necessary to a subsequence, {vn}n∈N := {un−u}n∈N ⊂ Ds,p
sequence for the functional I∞ at the level c − I(u). Moreover, we have
Ds,p(RN ) + on(1).

Ds,p(RN ) = [un]p

(2.3)

and

0 (Ω) is a Palais-Smale

8

L. BRASCO, M. SQUASSINA, AND Y. YANG

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that (2.2) readily gives that I ′(u) = 0, i.e. u is a critical point of I. By
deﬁnition and hypothesis (2.2), we have that {|vn|p}n∈N is bounded in Lp∗
s/p(Ω) and vn → 0 a.e.
on Ω. Thus it follows that |vn|p converges weakly in Lp∗
(Ω), we
can infer

s/p(Ω) to 0. Since a ∈ L(p∗

s /p)′

lim

n→∞ˆΩ

a |vn|pdx = 0.

A similar argument, shows that

By (i1) of Lemma 2.2 we also get

ˆΩ

a |un|pdx = ˆΩ

a |u|pdx + on(1).

[un]p

Ds,p(RN ) − [vn]p

Ds,p(RN ) = [u]p

Ds,p(RN ) + on(1),

which is (2.3). By using the three previous displays and Lemma 2.1 for Lp∗

s (Ω), we have

I∞(vn) = I(vn) + on(1) = I(un) − I(u) + on(1) = c − I(u) + on(1).

Finally, by virtue Lemma 2.3 applied to the sequence un − u, we have

and thus

lim

n→∞(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)a Jp(un − u)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)L(p∗

I ′
∞(vn) = I ′(vn) + ˆon(1),

= 0,

s )′ (Ω)

where ˆon(1) denotes a sequence going to zero in D−s,p′
Lemma 2.3 we further get

(Ω). By using assertions (i2), (i3) and

I ′
∞(vn) = I ′(vn) + ˆon(1) = I ′(un) − I ′(u) + ˆon(1) = ˆon(1),

and ˆon(1) still denotes a sequence going to zero in D−s,p′

(Ω). This concludes the proof.

2.2. Scaling invariance and related facts. The following result follows from a direct com-
putation, we leave the veriﬁcation to the reader.

Lemma 2.5 (Scaling invariance). For z ∈ Ω and λ > 0, we set

Ωz,λ :=

.

Then, the following facts hold:

• if u ∈ Ds,p

0 (Ω) and we set

then [vz,λ]Ds,p(RN ) = [u]Ds,p(RN ) and kvz,λkLp∗

Proof. Let us assume (2.4), under this assumption the sets Ωn converges to RN . Thus, for every
0 (RN ) with compact support, we can assume that Ωn contain the support of ϕ for n

By arbitrariness of ϕ ∈ C ∞

By recalling the deﬁnitions of Zn and Vn, we get that the ﬁrst term is uniformly bounded, while
the second one coincides with

[v ζ(λn/̺n·) − v]p′

Ds,p(RN ),

which converges to 0 thanks to Lemma A.2. This proves (2.9) and by using it in conjunction
with Lemma 2.2, we get

hI ′
(cid:3)

∞(v), ϕni = 0 by the ﬁrst part of the proof. This allows us to conclude.

Lemma 2.7 (Scalings, case II). Under the assumptions of Lemma 2.6, if

then z0 ∈ ∂Ω, v ∈ Ds,p

hI ′

0 (H),

0 (H), i.e.

where H is a half-space.

Proof. Under the assumption (2.10), the proof is the same as in the ﬁrst part of Lemma 2.6, we
only have to observe that in this case the sets Ωn converge to a half-space H.
(cid:3)

Next we prove that nonsingular scalings of weakly vanishing sequences are weakly vanishing.

2.3. Estimates for solutions. Next we prove a Caccioppoli inequality, which will turn out to
be the main technical tool in order to handle Step 3 in the proof of Theorem 1.1.

Proposition 2.9 (Caccioppoli inequality). Let F ∈ D−s,p′

(Ω) and let u ∈ Ds,p

0 (Ω) with

Then for every open set Ω′ such that Ω′ ∩ Ω 6= ∅ and every positive ψ ∈ C ∞

Proof. The proof is the same as that of Caccioppoli inequality [5, Proposition 3.5]. The only
diﬀerences are that here F is not necessarily (represented by) a function and that the test

GLOBAL COMPACTNESS FOR NONLOCAL PROBLEMS

function ψ can cross the boundary ∂Ω. We insert the test function2 ϕ = ψp u, where ψ ∈ C ∞
is as in the statement. Then we get
Jp(u(x) − u(y))

(u(x) ψ(x)p − u(y) ψ(y)p) dx dy = hF, u ψpi.

|x − y|N +s p

We now split the double integral in three parts:

I1 = ˆΩ′×Ω′

Jp(u(x) − u(y))

|x − y|N +s p

(u(x) ψ(x)p − u(y) ψ(y)p) dx dy,

and

I2 = ˆΩ′×(RN \Ω′)
I3 = −ˆΩ′×(RN \Ω′)

|x − y|N +s p

u(x) ψ(x)p dx dy,

Jp(u(x) − u(y))

|x − y|N +s p

u(y) ψ(y)p dx dy

The ﬁrst integral I1 can be estimated exactly as in [5, Proposition 3.5], with the choices

v = u,

g(t) = t = G(t),

there. This gives

(2.12)

c ˆΩ′×Ω′(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u(x) ψ(x) − u(y) ψ(y)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|ψ(x) − ψ(y)|p

|x − y|N +s p (cid:16)|u(x)|p + |u(y)|p(cid:17) dx dy.

For the estimate of I2 we proceed similarly to [5], by observing that the positivity assumption
on u can be dropped. Namely, we simply observe that by monotonicity of τ 7→ Jp(τ ), for x ∈ Ω′
we have

or

Jp(u(x) − u(y)) ≥ Jp(−u(y)),

if u(x) ≥ 0

Jp(u(x) − u(y)) ≤ Jp(−u(y)),

if u(x) < 0.

Thus in both cases we get

Jp(u(x) − u(y)) u(x) ≥ Jp(−u(y)) u(x).

Then we obtain

(2.13)

I2 ≥ −ˆΩ′×(RN \Ω′)

|u(x)| ψ(x)p dx.

The third integral can be estimated in a similar fashion. By inserting the above estimates in
(2.11), we get the conclusion.

Proof. For p = 2, see [20, Lemma 2.5]. In the general case, the heuristic idea is to exploit the
fact that u± := max{±u, 0} ∈ Ds,p
0 (E) \ {0} are both positive subsolutions of (2.15). Thus the
above universal estimates hold for both of them separately. More precisely, it is readily seen
that for a.e. (x, y) ∈ R2N the following inequalities hold

Jp(u(x) − u(y))(u+(x) − u+(y)) ≥ |u+(x) − u+(y)|p,
Jp(u(x) − u(y))(u−(y) − u−(x)) ≥ |u−(x) − u−(y)|p.

Then, testing equation (2.15) by u+ (respectively −u−) yields

In turn, by H¨older inequality and (3.2), with simple manipulations it follows

where C > 0 depends on N, s, p, µ, c and the norm of a, but not on n. Whence, from (3.1), (3.2)
and (3.3), we infer, as n → ∞

[un]p

Ds,p(RN ) ≤ C + on(1)[un]Ds,p(RN ),

which shows the boundedness in Ds,p

Ds,p(RN ) = [un]p
[u1

0 (Ω). Hence, passing if necessary to a subsequence, we
0 (Ω) and un → v0 almost everywhere in Ω. By Lemma 2.4, it follows that
0 (Ω) is a Palais-Smale sequence for I∞ at level c − I(v0), and
Ds,p(RN ) − [v0]p

as n → ∞.

For all n ∈ N, the function r 7→ Qn(r) is continuous on R+ (see Lemma 3.1 below). This and

Moreover, by recalling (3.5), we obtain that

20

L. BRASCO, M. SQUASSINA, AND Y. YANG

In Step 2 above we used the following result, which is well-known. We record its proof for the
sake of completeness.

Lemma 3.1. Let f ∈ L1(RN ), then its Levy concentration function

Qf (r) := sup

ξ∈RN ˆBr(ξ)

|f | dx,

r ≥ 0,

is a continuous function. If f ≡ 0 outside a bounded set K with smooth boundary, then for every
r ≥ 0 the supremum in the deﬁnition of Qf (r) is actually a maximum. More precisely, we have

Qf (r) := max

ξ∈KrˆBr(ξ)

|f | dx,

with Kr = {x ∈ RN : dist(x, K) ≤ r}.

Proof. The function Qf is monotone non decreasing. Observe that for every ξ ∈ RN , the function

r 7→ ˆBr(ξ)

|f | dx

is continuous, then Qf is lower semicontinuous as a supremum of continuous functions. Let us
suppose that there exists r0 > 0 such that

ℓ+ := lim
r→r+
0

Qf (r) 6= lim
r→r−
0

Qf (r) =: ℓ−.

By monotonicity and lower semicontinuity of Qf , this means that ℓ+ > ℓ− = Qf (r0). Let us set
ε = ℓ+ − Qf (r0), then for every r > r0 we have

By deﬁnition of Qf , we can then choose ξ0 = ξ0(ε, r) ∈ RN such that

Qf (r) − Qf (r0) ≥ ε.

ε
2

≤ ˆBr(ξ0)

|f | dx − ˆBr0 (ξ0)

|f | dx = ˆBr(ξ0)\Br0 (ξ0)

|f | dx.

Since the measure of the annulus Br(ξ0) \ Br0 (ξ0) converges to 0 as r ց r0, this gives the desired
contradiction. Let us now assume that f = 0 almost everywhere in RN \ K. For every r > 0
the function

ξ 7→ ˆBr(ξ)

|f | dx,

is continuous and it vanishes if Br(ξ) ⊂ RN \ K. This happens if dist(ξ, K) > r and we conclude
the proof.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.2. We observe that if the level c satisﬁes

(3.10)

c < 2

s
N

µ(cid:18) Sp,s

µ (cid:19)N/sp

.

then k in Theorem 1.1 is either 0 (compactness holds) or k = 1 (compactness fails). In the second
case, the unique function v1 must have constant sign and be diﬀerent from 0 almost everywhere.
Indeed, let us assume (3.10) and observe that I(v0) ≥ 0, since v0 is a critical point of I. If we
suppose that v1 is sign-changing, from Lemma 2.10 and the decomposition (1.10) we would get

c = I(v0) + I∞(v1) ≥ 2 µ

s

N (cid:18) Sp,s

µ (cid:19)N/sp

thus contradicting (3.10). This implies that v1 has constant sign and we can conclude that
v1 6= 0 almost everywhere, thanks to Proposition B.3.

GLOBAL COMPACTNESS FOR NONLOCAL PROBLEMS

We say that {un}n∈N ⊂ Ds,p

Palais-Smale sequence and

0 (Ω) is a Palais-Smale sequence with sign for I at level c if it is a

lim
n→∞

k(un)−kLp∗

s (Ω) = 0.

With minor modiﬁcations in the proof of Theorem 1.1, we can get the following variant for
Palais-Smale sequences with sign. We leave the details to the reader.

Theorem 3.3. We assume hypothesis (NA). Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1) be such that
N > s p. Let Ω ⊂ RN be an open bounded set with smooth boundary. Let {un}n∈N ⊂ Ds,p
0 (Ω) be
a Palais-Smale sequence with sign for the functional I deﬁned in (1.4) at level c.

Then there exist:

• a (possibly trivial) non-negative solution v0 ∈ Ds,p
s −1,

p u + a |u|p−2 u = µ up∗

(−∆)s

0 (Ω) of

in Ω,

• a number k ∈ N and v1, v2 · · · , vk ∈ Ds,p(RN ) \ {0} positive solutions of

s−1,

in RN .

• a sequence of positive real numbers {λi

n}n∈N ⊂ R+ with λi

n → 0 and a sequence of points

{zi

n}n∈N ⊂ {x ∈ Ω : dist(x, ∂Ω) ≥ λi

n}, for i = 1, . . . , k;

such that, up to a subsequence, conclusions (1.8), (1.9) and (1.10) follow.

The positivity of the limiting proﬁles v1, . . . , vk in the result above can be obtained by ap-

pealing again to the minimum principle of Proposition B.3.

4. Radial case

4.1. Improved embeddings for radial functions. In the proof of Theorem 1.3, we need the
following embedding result for the space Ds,p
0,rad(B). In what follows, by K ⋐ E we mean that
K is an open bounded set with compact closure contained in E.

Proposition 4.1 (Compact embeddings). Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1), we set

s =(

p#

p

,

1 − s p
+∞,

if s p < 1,

if s p ≥ 1.

Then we have the compact embedding

Ds,p

0,rad(BR) ֒→ Lq(K),

for every 1 ≤ q < p#

s and every K ⋐ RN \ {0}.

0 (BR) ֒→ Lp

Proof. Let us start with the case s p > 1. We remark that we already know that the embedding
Ds,p
loc(RN ) is compact (for example, see [3, Theorem 2.7]). A simple interpolation
argument permits to infer the desired conclusion. Indeed, let us take q > p, a set K ⋐ RN \ {0},
for every u ∈ Ds,p

(q−p) dx

0,rad(BR) by using Lemma 4.3 and (4.1) we obtain

N −s p

|u|(cid:17)q−p

Thanks to this we can get the desired conclusion.

22

L. BRASCO, M. SQUASSINA, AND Y. YANG

As far as the case sp ≤ 1 is concerned, we still use that Ds,p

0 (BR) compactly embeds into
Lp(BR) and then the assertion follows by Lemma 4.3 jointly with a standard interpolation
argument in Lebesgue spaces.
(cid:3)
Remark 4.2 (The exponent p#
s coincides with the one-dimensional
Sobolev exponent. In the case s p < 1 it is not possible to go beyond this exponent in Propo-
sition 4.1. Indeed, for s p < 1 it is not diﬃcult to construct a bounded sequence {un}n∈N ⊂
Ds,p

0,rad(B1(0)) such that for a suitable compact set K ⊂ RN \ {0} we have

s ). We observe that p#

lim
n→∞

kunkLq(K) = ∞,

for p#

s < q ≤ ∞.

Let us consider the spherical shells

An = {x ∈ RN : 1 − rn < |x| < 1},

with rn = n− p

1−s p .

If we denote by 1E the characteristic function of a set E, we observe that the functions un = n 1An
belong to Ds,p
0,rad(B1(0)). Indeed, if P (E) denotes the perimeter of a smooth set E ⊂ RN , we
have

[un]p

Ds,p(RN ) = np [1An]Ds p,1(RN ) ≤ C np |An|1−s p P (An)s p,

where the last inequality is [3, Corollary 4.4]. It is not diﬃcult to see that

|An|1−s p P (An)s p ≃ r(1−s p)

n

= n−p,

which implies that

[un]p

Ds,p(B1(0)) ≤ [un]p

Ds,p(RN ) ≤ C.

On the other hand, for q > p/(1 − s p) we have

kunkq

Lq(RN ) = nq |An| ≃ nq rn = nq− p

1−s p ,

which diverges.

We also point out that the very same example shows that in the limit case q = p#
s

the

embedding is continuous, but not compact.

The previous result was based on the following Radial Lemma for fractional Sobolev spaces.
We give the proof for the reader’s convenience. For more general results valid in Besov and
Triebel spaces, we refer the reader to [19] and [22, Chapter 6].

Lemma 4.3 (A nonlocal Radial Lemma). Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1). Let BR be the ball
centered at the origin with radius R > 0. Then we have the continuous embeddings:

• if s p > 1

• if s p < 1

• if s p = 1

for every 1 ≤ t < ∞.

Proof. We divide the proof in three cases.

Case s p > 1. Let 0 < ̺ < R, since u is a radial function we get

ˆ∂B̺

|u|p dHN −1 = N ωN ̺N −1 |u(x)|p,

for |x| = ̺.

GLOBAL COMPACTNESS FOR NONLOCAL PROBLEMS

We observe that the integral is well-deﬁned, since u has a trace in Lp(∂B̺) thanks to the
hypothesis s p > 1. We can now use the trace inequality for Ds,p(B̺) (see [23, Section 3.3.3]),
so to obtain

0 < |x| < 0,

We now take K ⋐ RN \ {0}. Then, there exists 0 < R0 < R1 such that

From (4.1) we directly get

4.2. Proof of Theorem 1.3. The proof is the same as that of Theorem 1.1, we only need to
modify Step 4 and Step 5 as follows. With the previous notations, as in the proof of Theorem
1.1 we already know that λ1

n → 0 as n goes to ∞. We now show that this implies that

Indeed, if this was not the case, up to a subsequence, one would have |z1
for some τ0 > 0. Taking into account Proposition 4.1, observing that p∗
and recalling that u1
K ⋐ RN \ {0}. Then, for 0 < τ < τ0, we conclude

n converges to 0 almost everywhere, we have u1

thus we do not need Assumption (NA) this time.

Then, in order to prove (1.11), we need to remove the translations by zi

done by appealing to (4.7) and continuity of Lp norms with respect to translations. Indeed, by

The following result has been curcially exploited in the proof of Theorem 1.1, in order to

localize the rescaled sequences.

Lemma A.2 (Truncation Lemma). Let ζ ∈ C ∞
on B1(0). Then

0 (B2(0)) be a positive function such that ζ ≡ 1

(A.1)

for any v ∈ Ds,p

0 (RN ) ∩ Lq(RN ) with q < p∗

s and {µn}n∈N ⊂ R+ such that µn → 0.

Proof. We rewrite the term in (A.1) as [v ψn]Ds,p(RN ), where ψn(x) := ζ(µn x) − 1. We have
v ψn ∈ Ds,p

0 (RN ) thanks to Lemma A.1 and

|v(x) ψn(x) − v(y) ψn(y)|p

|x − y|N +s p

Then, since kψnkL∞ ≤ 1 and v ∈ Ds,p

|ψn(x)|p |v(x) − v(y)|p

|x − y|N +s p

|x − y|N +s p dx dy = 0.

.

For the second term, we observe that ψn(x) − ψn(y) = ζ(µn x) − ζ(µn y), introduce

IRN (y) = ˆRN

Appendix B. Some regularity estimates

We collect in this Appendix some basic regularity results for nonlocal equations needed in the

paper.

Proposition B.1. Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1) be such that s p < N . Let E ⊂ RN be an open
set with |E| = +∞ and let V ∈ Ds,p

0 (E) be a weak solution of

(B.1)

Then we have

Proof. We ﬁrst observe that |V | ∈ Ds,p

0 (E) is a positive subsolution of (B.1), in the sense that

for every ϕ ∈ Ds,p
|V |. For 0 < α < 1 and ε > 0, we introduce the Lipschitz increasing function

ψε(t) = ˆ t

where in the second inequality we used that 0 < α < 1. We insert in (B.3) the test function

for every 0 < α < 1. By taking the limit as ε goes to 0, we get the desired integrability (B.2). (cid:3)

Next we state a variant of an estimate proved by Di Castro, Kuusi and Palatucci in [8].

Lemma B.2 (Logarithmic estimate). Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1) be such that s p < N . Let
Ω ⊂ RN be an open bounded set, a ∈ LN/sp(Ω) and let u ∈ Ds,p

0 (Ω) \ {0} be such that

((−∆)s

u = 0,

p u + a up−1 ≥ µ |u|q−2 u,

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

for some µ ∈ R and p ≤ q ≤ p∗

s. That is, for every ϕ ∈ Ds,p

0 (Ω) with ϕ ≥ 0, we have
a up−1ϕ dx ≥ µ ˆΩ

|u|q−2 u ϕ dx.

Let us suppose that u ≥ 0 in B2 r(x0) ⋐ Ω. Then for every 0 < δ < 1 there holds

where u− = max{−u, 0} and C = C(N, p, s) > 0 is a constant.

Proof. The proof is exactly the same of that of the Logarithmic Lemma for supersolutions in
the case a ≡ 0, see [8, Lemma 1.3]. We take a test function φ ∈ C ∞

0 (B3/2 r(x0)) such that

0 ≤ φ ≤ 1,

φ ≡ 1 on Br(x0),

|∇φ| ≤

Then we insert the test function ϕ = φp (δ + u)1−p in the equation. By using that

and proceeding exactly as in the proof of [8, Lemma 1.3] to estimate the nonlocal term, we end
up with inequality (B.5).
(cid:3)

Proposition B.3 (Minimum principle). Let 1 < p < ∞ and s ∈ (0, 1) be such that s p < N .
Let Ω ⊂ RN be an open bounded connected set, a ∈ LN/sp(Ω) and let u ∈ Ds,p
0 (Ω) \ {0} be a non
negative function such that

((−∆)s

u = 0,

p u + a up−1 ≥ µ uq−1,

in Ω,
in RN \ Ω,

for some µ ∈ R and p ≤ q ≤ p∗

s. Then we have u > 0 almost everywhere in Ω.

Proof. The proof is the same of that for the case a+ ≡ 0 and µ ≥ 0, which is contained
in [2, Theorem A.1]. It is suﬃcient to replace the logarithmic estimate there with the one of
Lemma B.2 and use that u ∈ Lp∗
(cid:3)

s (Ω). We leave the details to the reader.
