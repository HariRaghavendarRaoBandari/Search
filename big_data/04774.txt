The Helstrom Bound

Bernhard K. Meister∗

Department of Physics, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China 100872

(Dated: March 16, 2016)

Quantum state discrimination between two wave functions on a ring is considered. The optimal
minimum-error probability is known to be given by the Helstrom bound. A new strategy is intro-
duced by inserting instantaneously two impenetrable barriers dividing the ring into two chambers.
In the process, the candidate wave functions, as the insertion points become nodes, get entangled
with the barriers and can, if judiciously chosen, be distinguished with smaller error probability. As
a consequence, the Helstrom bound under idealised conditions can be violated.

INTRODUCTION

Experimental design and data analysis are common
challenges in science, and particular acute in quantum
mechanics.
In the literature diﬀerent approaches are
discussed. Here the Bayes procedure for state discrim-
ination with the aim to minimise the expected cost is
employed. The existence of a prior associated with the
states to be distinguished is assumed.

Two disparate concepts are combined in the paper.
These are quantum state discrimination and the modiﬁ-
cation of the quantum potential resulting in a transfor-
mation of the wave function. Bayesian hypothesis test-
ing, the particular form of quantum state discrimination
investigated here, was developed by Helstrom and others
[1–3]. For a recent paper on the topic of state discrimi-
nation between two possible states with given prior and
transition probability see Brody et al. [4]. It is generally
accepted, but will be challenged in the paper, that the
optimal Bayes cost in the binary case, is given by the
Helstrom bound, which only depends on the prior and
the transition probability between the states and can be
written in a simple closed form. The second concept is
the ability to modify wave functions in a beneﬁcial way,
if one inserts impenetrable barriers corresponding to a
potential spike in a simple conﬁguration space, here cho-
sen to be a ring. In earlier papers [5, 6] these two ideas
were applied to study the insertion of one barrier into a
ring or a one-dimensional inﬁnite square well both adi-
abatically and instantaneously. The current approach is
simpler by exploiting the existing nodes of the candidate
wave functions and by focusing on the link between the
energy required to insert the barrier and the candidate
wave functions.

Next, a description of the setup and the procedure to
be analysed. The following decision problem is presented.
With equal probability, prior of 1/2, one of two quantum
states is put into the conﬁguration space - a ring. Our
challenge is to determine with the smallest possible error,
which state has been selected. Two strategies for calcu-

lating the Bayes cost are proposed. In the ﬁrst strategy,
the combination of prior and transition probability be-
tween the two quantum states alone is suﬃcient to cal-
culate the conventional optimal minimum error probabil-
ity, i.e. the Helstrom bound, prior to the insertion of any
barrier. The standard procedure, reliant on the optimal
POVM as described in the book by Helstrom[1], results
in the following binary decision cost

2 −

2p1 − cos2(α),

where cos2(α) is the transition probability between the
two candidate states, and cost 1 is assigned to an incor-
rect and cost 0 for a correct decision.

The second strategy for calculating the error proba-
bility is novel. The wave function is ﬁrst modiﬁed by
the simultaneous insertion of two barriers breaking the
symmetry of the conﬁguration space. The insertion of
the barrier can be carried out with diﬀerent speeds. We
consider an extreme case: instantaneous insertion. This
insertion can require energy and can modify the wave
function, since its amplitude at the impenetrable barrier
location will be zero and the expansion in the new bases
to reproduce the original amplitude, except at the inser-
tion points, is accompanied with a change of energy. The
modiﬁed candidate wave function, now entangled with
the barriers, is probed and the new binary decision cost
estimated. It is shown that the extended wave functions
incorporating the barriers can be orthogonal, even if the
original overlap was non-zero.

Two motivations for this research stand out. On the
one hand it sheds some light on foundational issues in
quantum measurement theory, and on the other hand
a plethora of problems in quantum information theory
depend on optimal state discrimination.

Quantum mechanics on the ring is speciﬁed by the
Hamiltonian and boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian
of a particle trapped on a ring of radius one is

function is deﬁned for θ ∈ [0, 2π].

The structure of the rest of paper is as follows.

2

Due to the pre-insertion symmetry both candidate
wave functions are eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of
a particle on a ring. The symmetry is only broken by
the barriers. The barriers are inserted at the point 0 and
α at time t = 0. The barrier inserted at point 0 leaves
φ unchanged, but the second barrier at point α hits a
non-nodal point. The situation is the reverse for ψ, since
it lacks a node at α, but has a node at 0. As explained
before, at nodal points no energy transfer occurs, but a
barrier at a non-nodal point is associated with a change
of energy.

An instantaneous insertion requires, due to the change
of the conﬁguration space, an expansion of the original
wave functions into the energy basis of the two separate
one dimensional inﬁnite wells. This will be carried out
next. The ﬁrst expansion is in the interval (0, α) with
the discrete energy levels Eα
2M α2 and the second
expansion is for the interval (α, 2π) with the discrete en-
ergy levels E2π−α
2M(2π−α)2 such that the ﬁrst can-
didate wave function has directly after the insertion the
following form

INSTANTANEOUS INSERTION OF A

BARRIER

In this section the barrier insertion, considered to be
instantaneous, at both nodal and non-nodal points is re-
viewed. The nodal point insertion is dealt with ﬁrst. This
is easier, since the particle wave function and energy is
left unchanged - for background material see section II of
Bender et al. [7], where a series of results for a particle
in a one dimensional box, directly applicable to quantum
mechanics on a ring, were established. As an aside, we
only call a point a node, or more correctly a ‘ﬁxed node’,
if the amplitudes at this point stays zero at all times.
Wave functions that are superposition of eigenfunctions
of H can have zero amplitude points that change with
time. These we do not consider, since an insertion at a
‘transitory node’ can require energy.

The situation is more intricate for an insertion at a
non-nodal point. Energy is needed to modify the wave
function.
In the idealised setting considered here the
required energy is inﬁnite. The energy localised in the
barrier point inserted at t = 0 propagates through the
system at t > 0 and increases the energy on the ring.
The result is a fractal wave function. The details of the
calculation can be found in sections IV & VI of Bender
et al. [7] or in section II of [5] & [6].

III. THE INSTANTANEOUS INSERTION OF

TWO IMPENETRABLE BARRIERS ON A RING

The case of two simultaneous insertions changing the
ring into two separate inﬁnite square wells is considered
in this section. In the following paragraphs the cost is
evaluated before and after the insertion of two barriers for
distinguishing the following two candidate wave functions
deﬁned, at t = 0, as

Diﬀerent elements in the expansion are associated to
diﬀerent energies. Due to energy conservation there has
to be a source for this change of energy, which will be
always positive for a value of α of π/4. This additional
energy can only come from the barrier inserted at the
non-nodal point. A laser beam could be a possible re-
alisation of the barrier. The photons of the laser beam,
or any other realisation of the barrier, have an energy
dependent entanglement with the expanded wave func-
tion on the ring, where each combination of energy levels
in the two chambers is associated with a complementary
state for the barriers to achieve energy conservation. The
energy transfer is to φ from the barrier at α and to ψ
from the barrier at 0, since each candidate wave function
has its energy only modiﬁed through one speciﬁc barrier
corresponding to the initial non-nodal point.

The extended wave function including the barrier can

be written before the insertion as either

n,m (0) and ωaf ter

respond to barriers that transferred ∆Enm to the candi-
date wave functions Φaf ter and Ψaf ter respectively. The

It follows from the association of the diﬀerent barrier
states, e.g. photon states representing a laser beam,
with diﬀerent energies.

After the insertion, the entanglement of the two can-
didate wave functions with the respective barriers results
in two states, which are orthogonal. As a consequence, as
an improvement from the conventional Helstrom bound,
the associated binary decision cost reduces to zero. In
the upcoming conclusion the result is reviewed and some
comments added.

IV. CONCLUSION

The aim of the paper was to show that the Helstrom
bound in the binary quantum discrimination setting can
be breached. Inserting a barrier instantaneously in a ring
at a non-nodal point always requires energy, whereas an
insertion at a nodal point leaves the energy unchanged. If
two barriers are inserted, one at a node and one at a non-
nodal point, then there is only energy-level dependent
entanglement of the wave function on the ring with the
barrier at the non-nodal point. Furthermore, by having
the node of one candidate wave function to be the non-
nodal point of the other, one can ensure that the energy
transfer in the two cases is to barriers at distinct points.
This can be used to help distinguish between diﬀerent
states. An extension beyond an instantaneous insertion
should be possible, since any non-adiabatic insertion at
a non-nodal point needs energy. Nevertheless, a careful
analysis of the ﬁnite speed case is required. The exact
cost reduction depends on how precisely one can place the
barrier, the width of the barrier, the speed of insertion,
i.e. three issues related to time evolution of the potential
associated with the barrier. If each of these points can
be addressed satisfactorily, then not only in the idealised
situation can one obtain an improvement of the optimal
cost beyond the Helstrom bound.

Naturally, one can criticise the failure to provide a re-
alistic time evolution; only the inﬁnitely fast insertion
was examined. In defence, one can point to the idealised
nature of the proposal and the statement that more real-
istic examples can be viewed as an extrapolation of the
procedure under consideration.

The following Gedankenexperiment might be instruc-
tive, because it shows that it is possible to construct an

example were no information is transferred to the exper-
imenter, when the potential representing the barrier is
altered. Imagine an experimenter doing a ﬁxed amount
of work per unit of time to insert the barrier, i.e. pushes
in the barrier with constant power. Dependent on the
test wave function the change of the potential is either
larger or smaller. The potential takes on diﬀerent shapes
and aﬀect the states in diﬀerent ways, ergo can change
the distance between the states, without direct, energy
based, leakage of information to the outside.

Questions about the possibility of superluminal com-
munication can be raised, but one should keep in mind
that the Schr¨odinger equation, a diﬀusion equation with-
out a propagation speed limit, has its limitations.

Almost without fail quantum algorithms can be viewed
as procedures to distinguish between diﬀerent states.
The method described above works for states with ar-
bitrary overlap and should ﬁnd application in the area of
quantum algorithm.

Experimental implementation, for example in the area
of Bose-Einstein condensate or ion traps, with a laser
beam as a barrier, should be of interest.
