ABSTRACT

High-precision kinematic studies of globular clusters require an accurate knowledge of all possible sources
of contamination. Amongst other sources, binary stars can introduce systematic biases in the kinematics. Using
a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations with different concentrations and binary fractions, we investigate the
effect of unresolved binaries on proper-motion dispersion proﬁles, treating the simulations like HST proper-
motion samples. Since globular clusters evolve towards a state of partial energy equipartition, more massive
stars lose energy and decrease their velocity dispersion. As a consequence, on average, binaries have a lower
velocity dispersion, since they are more massive kinematic tracers. We show that, in the case of clusters with
high binary fraction (initial binary fraction of 50%) and high concentration (i.e., closer to energy equipartition),
unresolved binaries introduce a color-dependent bias in the velocity dispersion of main-sequence stars of the
order of 0.1-0.3 km s−1 (corresponding to 1 − 6% of the velocity dispersion), with the reddest stars having a
lower velocity dispersion, due to the higher fraction of contaminating binaries. This bias depends on the ability
to distinguish binaries from single stars, on the details of the color-magnitude diagram and the photometric
errors. We apply our analysis to the HSTPROMO data set of NGC 7078 (M15) and show that no effect
ascribable to binaries is observed, consistent with the low binary fraction of the cluster. Our work indicates that
binaries do not signiﬁcantly bias proper-motion velocity-dispersion proﬁles, but should be taken into account
in the error budget of kinematic analyses.

1. INTRODUCTION

Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest stellar sys-
tems in the universe and provide crucial information on the
early phases of galaxy formation and assembly. In order to
constrain their formation, a growing focus has been devoted to
the study of their internal kinematics, which provides a long-
lasting fossil record of their formation and dynamical evolu-
tion.

Typical kinematic studies of Galactic GCs are based on
line-of-sight velocities, from spectroscopic measurements ei-
ther of resolved stars, or of (partially) unresolved stars
through integrated-light spectroscopy. These measurements
are limited by the fact that only one component of the
velocity-vector is observed and only for the brightest sources,
i.e., giant stars all with similar mass. However, a signif-
icant improvement was recently possible thanks to high-
precision Hubble Space Telescope (HST) proper motions
(HSTPROMO, Bellini et al. 2014; Watkins et al. 2015a,b),
providing velocity measurements on the plane-of-the-sky for
22 GCs, with a median of ∼60,000 stars per cluster, and
thanks to other proper-motion samples dedicated to single
GCs (e.g., McLaughlin et al. 2006; Richer et al. 2013 for
NGC 104, McNamara et al. 2003 for NGC 7078, McNamara
& McKeever 2011; McNamara et al. 2012 for NGC 6266, and
Anderson & van der Marel 2010 for NGC 5139).

Proper-motion samples provide two-dimensional velocity
information (the two components on the plane-of-the-sky) and
sample both bright giant and fainter stars along the main se-
quence, allowing to measure the motion of stars with differ-
ent masses. Moreover, since they provide large samples of
stars, they are ideal to study the detailed internal kinematics
of a GC, reaching low levels of random errors, and possibly
allowing the coupling of the kinematics with color and chem-
ical information.

An accurate kinematic analysis requires that any bias
present in the observed kinematics should be well understood.
A common source of contamination is binaries. Binaries
can contaminate line-of-sight measurements, due to the mo-
tions of the stellar components around their mutual barycen-
ter adding to the systemic motion of the binary system (e.g.,
Minor et al. 2010). Unidentiﬁed binaries can cause an overes-
timate of the measured line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Un-
fortunately, their identiﬁcation is challenging, even for bright
stars, since it requires repeated spectroscopic measurements.
The resulting bias is negligible in typical GCs, characterized
by a low binary fraction (lower than that of ﬁeld stars, Milone
at al. 2012), but it can be crucial for faint stellar systems (e.g.,
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies) with low velocity dispersion and
small data samples (McConnachie & Cote 2010; Bradford et
al. 2011).

In the case of proper motions, binaries can affect the data in
three ways. First, the internal binary motion can produce an
effect on the astrometric measurements, adding scatter to the
proper-motion determination; this is, however, negligible.5

5 The effect is proportional to a/(σ T ), with a major axis of the binary, σ
typical velocity dispersion, T time-baseline of the proper-motion measure-
ments; this effect is maximum for face-on orbits and epochs separated by a
half-integer of the orbital period.

NOTE. — Properties ofthe simulations for a 11 Gyr snapshot observed at 5 kpc. The name of the simulation is followed by the primordial binary fraction
finitial, the global binary fraction at 11 Gyr fﬁnal, the binary fraction within the FoV of 4 arcmin and magnitude cut between 17 and 24 r-band mag, and the binary
fraction within the core radius Rc. The concentration c = log(Rt /Rc), the core radius Rc, and the half-light radius Rh are also provided.

Second, semi-resolved binaries seen as astrometric blends,
can be characterized by poor-quality astrometry (because of
the difﬁculties in centroiding the PSF), that translates to bi-
ased proper-motion measurements. This effect can be reli-
ably mitigated using quality selection criteria on the proper-
motion samples (see the discussion for NGC 7078; Bellini et
al. 2014). Third, unresolved binaries can bias the kinemat-
ics since they are a more-massive kinematic tracer than single
stars at a given magnitude. In fact, due to two-body interac-
tions, GCs evolve towards a state of partial energy equipar-
tition (Trenti & van der Marel 2013; Bianchini et al. 2016).
This means that while more massive stars lose energy and
sink towards the center, less massive stars gain energy and
move outwards, leading to a mass-dependent kinematics.

Unresolved binaries, being more massive kinematic tracers,
will be characterized by a lower velocity dispersion.6 The ef-
fect of binaries on proper-motions samples would therefore
be to systematically decrease the velocity dispersion other-
wise measured from single stars alone. Moreover, since unre-
solved binaries are seen as a single star with ﬂux given by the
sum of the ﬂuxes of the two components, they are redder in
color along the main sequence. Their kinematic effect could
therefore introduce a subtle color-dependence on the kinemat-
ics, that must be disentangled from any other possible color-
dependent kinematic effects (e.g., the kinematic differences
expected from different multiple stellar population scenarios,
Henault-Brunet et al. 2015 and the observations presented in
Richer et al. 2013 for NGC104 and Bellini et al. 2015 for
NGC2808).

The aim of this letter is to understand and quantify the kine-
matic effect of unresolved binaries connected to partial energy
equipartition. We use a two step approach: ﬁrstly, we ana-
lyze a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations (Downing et al.
2010) spanning a realistic range of concentrations and binary
fractions, treating them as mock HST proper-motion samples
to look for the kinematic effects of binaries (Section 2 and
3). Secondly, we apply the same analysis to the HSTPROMO
data of NGC 7078 (M15) for a comparison to observations
(Section 4).

2. SIMULATIONS

We consider a set of Monte Carlo cluster simulations, de-
veloped by Downing et al. (2010) with the Monte Carlo code
by Giersz (1988). The simulations have an initial number of
particles of N = 500000, an initial mass function (IMF), stel-
lar evolution, and primordial binaries, providing a realistic
description of the long-term evolution of GCs with a single
stellar population.

6 Such mass-dependent kinematics can also be observed by comparing

blue straggler stars against evolved stars (Baldwin et al. submitted).

All simulations have initial conditions drawn from a Plum-
mer (1911) model, a Kroupa (2001) IMF, [Fe/H]=−1.3, and
an initial tidal cut-off at 150 pc (making them relatively iso-
lated). We consider 6 simulations, characterized by 3 values
of initial concentration with binary fraction of 10% or 50%.
The initial binary parameters are described in Downing et al.
(2010) and are based on the eigenvalue evolution and feeding
algorithms of Kroupa (1995). These prescriptions use birth
mass ratios drawn at random from the Kroupa (1993) IMF.
After 11 Gyr of dynamical evolution, the distribution of the
mass-ratio q is ﬂat for q > 0.5 (consistent with observations,
e.g., Milone et al. 2016), decreasing for q < 0.5, and with an
excess of binaries at q ≈ 1. The output of each simulation
consists of the three-dimensional position and velocity vec-
tors, the stellar mass and the magnitude for each star (in r and
i Sloan bands).

We treat our simulations similarly to real observations
(in particular to HSTPROMO proper motions, Bellini et al.
2014), considering the properties of an 11 Gyr snapshot, pro-
jected along the line-of-sight at 5 kpc distance (typical of a
Galactic GC). Furthermore, we consider stars in a ﬁeld-of-
view (FoV) of 4 arcmin around the center of the cluster, and
within the magnitude range of mr = 17 (just below the turnoff)
to mr = 24. The properties of our simulations are reported in
Table 1.

The simulations span a range of concentrations7 c = 1.12 −
2.06 similar to typical Galactic GCs, with a range of ﬁnal bi-
nary fractions from (cid:39) 5% to (cid:39) 30% (consistent with observa-
tions, e.g., Milone at al. 2012; Sollima et al. 2007). Note that
we aim to explore a signiﬁcant range of the parameter space
without tuning our simulations to any speciﬁc GC.

Since the binary fraction is a radially-dependent quantity, in
Table 1 we report three values for the 11 Gyr snapshots: the
global binary fraction, the one within the FoV of 4 arcmin and
with a magnitude cut between 17 and 24 r-band magnitudes,
and the one within the core radius Rc. Note that, interestingly,
the binary fraction within the core radius for the simulations
with 50% primordial binaries settles to the value of (cid:39) 30%,
independent of the concentration of the cluster.

In a separate paper (Bianchini et al. 2016), we investigate in
detail the state of partial energy equipartition reached by our
simulations and its relation to the clusters properties. Here
we focus on the fact that all the simulations display mass-
dependent kinematics.

2.1. Incorporating errors in the simulation output

To enable a comparison with observations, we add realis-
tic errors to the simulations. The errors for each star are se-

7 Deﬁned as c = log(Rt /Rc), with Rt the tidal and Rc the core radius.

3

We analyze the differences in kinematics between binaries
and single stars, using the proper-motion samples extracted
from our simulations, restricted within the FoV of 4 arcmin
with added velocity errors.

FIG. 1.— Left: Color magnitude diagrams of Simulation 1, with and without artiﬁcial errors. Binaries (orange) are in a redder sequence parallel to the main
sequence. Note that the simulated r vs. r-i diagram does not match closely the typical observed r v. r-i diagram. Right: Velocity-dispersion proﬁles for single
and binaries separately. The top panel refers to bright stars only, for which typical measurements of line-of-sight velocities are available, while the bottom panel
refers to a typical magnitude range sampled by proper motions. Binaries show a lower velocity-dispersion proﬁle (globally, 8% lower than single stars) because
of the effect of partial energy equipartition.
lected to reproduce the trends of the errors in HSTPROMO
data (e.g., Figure 18 from Bellini et al. 2014). For both proper
motions and magnitudes, the errors are modeled to be mag-
nitude dependent by assigning larger errors to fainter stars.8
The errors are drawn at random from a Gaussian distribution9
with standard deviation increasing with stellar magnitude, fol-
lowing a growth a/(b − mag), where a and b are such that the
errors increase asymptotically for mag=25.5 in the i−band,
and produce an average magnitude error (average for all the
stars) of ≈ 0.02 and of ≈ 0.1 mas yr−1 for proper motions
(corresponding to ≈ 2 km s−1 at the distance10 of 5 kpc). Fig-
ure 1, shows an example of a color-magnitude diagram with
and without errors. Note that the detailed shape of the color-
magnitude diagram does not reproduce the typical observed r
vs. r-i diagram.

First, we assume that we are able to distinguish single
stars from binaries and construct separately their velocity-
dispersion proﬁles. In the right panel of Figure 1, we show the
result for Simulation 1, where binaries show a lower velocity-
dispersion proﬁle than single stars. For completeness, we
show the velocity dispersion calculated for the magnitude
range typically measured in line-of-sight velocity samples
(bright stars), and for typical proper-motion samples. Note
that, for line-of-sight measurements, the main bias introduced
by binaries is an overestimate of the velocity due to the mo-
tions of the stellar components around their mutual barycen-
ter (e.g., Minor et al. 2010). Here we focus only on the effect
on proper-motion samples, which so far has remained unex-
plored.

2.2. Construction of kinematic proﬁles

We construct kinematic proﬁles by dividing the projected
data into concentric radial bins each containing an equal num-
ber of stars. For every bin, a maximum-likelihood estimator
(Pryor & Meylan 1993) is used to obtain the velocity disper-
sion and the associated error, taking into account the individ-
ual measurement errors. The proper motions are decomposed
into radial and tangential components on the plane-of-the-sky

and the average dispersion σ =(cid:112)(σ2

T )/2 is used.

3. THE EFFECT OF UNRESOLVED BINARIES ON KINEMATICS

8 In real HST proper-motion observations, the errors are also radial de-
pendent, with higher errors for stars in the crowded center; this effect is not
considered here.

9 In the observations, photometric errors are non-symmetric; this can make
some main-sequence stars appear as red as binaries. In our simulations we do
not consider this possibility, assuming that these apparent binaries are reliably
rejected from observations (Bellini et al. 2014).

10 The proper motion are reported in mas yr−1; assuming a distance d in

kpc, a multiplication of 4.74d yields the values in km s−1.

For each simulation we calculate the global value of veloc-
ity dispersion for binaries and single stars within the FoV and
their percentage difference. The differences range between
(cid:39) 5% and (cid:39) 9%. The values are reported in Table 2.

We now consider the more realistic case in which we cannot
distinguish binaries from single stars. Since unresolved bina-
ries are seen as single stars with ﬂuxes given by the sum of
two stellar components, we expect them to be located prefer-
entially on the redder side of the main sequence (see Figure 1).
We divide the main sequence into three color bins restricted
to the FoV of 4 arcmin and with r-band magnitudes between
17 and 24 mag. We label them as left, center, and right bins,
each containing 1/3 of the stars (≈ 20,000-50,000 stars each,
depending on the simulation). We calculate the fraction of
binaries contaminating each color bin and the corresponding
velocity dispersion without distinguishing binaries from sin-
gle stars. We report the values in Table 2.

Velocity-dispersion proﬁles for the left, center and right color bins (blue, yellow, red, respectively). The proﬁles are constructed without distinguishing between
single stars and binaries. The velocity-dispersion proﬁles for single stars and for binaries are shown by dashed and solid black lines, respectively. The vertical
dotted lines indicate the core radii Rc and the half-light radii Rh. Simulations 1, 2 and 6 are shown. The ﬁrst shows no difference in velocity dispersion with
color, while the second and the last, characterized by a high binary contamination (cid:39) 50% in the right bins (see Table 2), show signiﬁcant kinematic differences
(up to 0.35 km s−1, corresponding to 6% of the central velocity dispersion) that become more pronounced in the center due to increasing binary fractions due to
mass segregation.

As expected, the right (redder) bins have a higher contam-
ination of binaries, up to (cid:39) 60%. However, the velocity dis-
persions for the different color bins are consistent with each
other, except for Simulation 2 and Simulation 6. These two
simulations are, in fact, characterized by high binary con-
tamination in the right color bin (54.4% and 45.7%, respec-
tively) and show a small ((cid:39) 0.1 km s−1, 1.5% of the veloc-
ity dispersion) but signiﬁcant difference in the global velocity
dispersion at the 2σ level.
In contrast, Simulation 4, even
though characterized by a 59.0% binary contamination in the
right bin, does not display color-dependent kinematic differ-
ences. This is explained by the fact that this simulation is the
least concentrated (c = 1.12) and reaches a low level of partial
energy equipartition, and hence displays a weak kinematic-
dependence on stellar mass (see Bianchini et al. 2016).

We note that the differences obtained in the velocity disper-
sion depend on the assumption for the photometric errors: as-
suming a more accurate photometry would enable us to distin-
guish binaries from single stars more efﬁciently. This would
allow us to measure larger differences in velocity dispersion
between the color bins.

Figure 2 shows a comparison between the velocity-
dispersion proﬁles of the three color bins, and the correspond-
ing proﬁles for single stars and binaries only. For Simulations
2 and 6, the kinematic difference becomes larger in the central
region, where the binary fraction increases. In particular, in
the central region of Simulation 6, the right color bin differs
from the left and the center bins by ≈ 0.015 mas yr−1 (0.35
km s−1 at 5 kpc, corresponding to ≈ 6% of the central veloc-
ity dispersion), with a signiﬁcance of 3.5σ.

4. APPLICATION TO HST PROPER MOTIONS OF NGC 7078

We apply the analysis described above to the HSTPROMO
proper motions of NGC 7078 (M15, Bellini et al. 2014), con-
sisting of 74,831 stars in a ﬁeld of ≈ 180×195 arcsec2 around
the center of the cluster, for which color information from the
F606W and F814W bands are available. We choose NGC
7078, since a detailed understanding of the sample’s quality
is already available and discussed in Bellini et al. (2014).

We perform the analysis on a high-quality subsample of the
data in which the contaminant stars and mismatched proper
motions are rejected, and only highly-accurate proper motions
are considered. We follow the selection criteria outlined in
Section 7.5 of (Bellini et al. 2014) and restrict our analysis
to the main-sequence stars between 19.5-22.5 F606W magni-
tude. The ﬁnal sample consists of 12,027 stars with an aver-
age proper-motion error of 0.07 mas yr−1 (corresponding to
3.4 km s−1 at 10.4 kpc, Harris 1996, 2010 edition).
Figure 3 shows the velocity-dispersion proﬁles for the color
bins. The global velocity dispersions are 0.214 ± 0.003,
0.207 ± 0.003, 0.213 ± 0.003 mas yr−1, for the left, central,
and right bins respectively, measured with an accuracy of
∼ 1.5%. The maximum difference is found between the cen-
tral and left bin, corresponding to 2% of the velocity disper-
sion, and the velocity dispersions are still consistent within
less than 2σ. Therefore, we do not detect any signiﬁcant dif-
ference between the proﬁles, ascribeble to the presence of
binaries. This is consistent with the low binary fraction of
3± 1% measured in NGC 7078 (Milone at al. 2012) similar
to our Simulation 1, where binaries do not lead to any kine-
matic signatures.

Finally, we note that NGC 7078 is known to host at least
three stellar populations (e.g. Piotto et al. 2015) differing

in helium abundances (and therefore main-sequence colors).
The lack of velocity dispersion differences between the color
bins (Fig. 3) can be interpreted in the context of multiple stel-
lar populations as an indication of the absence of signiﬁcant
kinematic differences among them, in the inner (cid:39) 2 arcmin.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We investigated and quantiﬁed the effect of unresolved bi-
naries on GC proper-motion dispersion proﬁles using Monte
Carlo cluster simulations. The simulations cover a large range
of concentrations and binary fractions (from (cid:39) 5% to (cid:39) 30%)
and reach a state of partial energy equipartition that imprints
a lower velocity dispersion on binary stars (that are, on av-
erage, more massive kinematic tracers than the single stars).
From the analysis of the simulations, treated similarly to HST
proper-motion samples, we conclude the following:

• Binaries can introduce a color-dependent bias in the
velocity dispersion calculated for the main sequence,
with the reddest stars showing a lower velocity disper-
sion, due to the higher fraction of contaminating bi-
naries. Only simulations with a high binary fraction
(initial binary fraction of 50%) and a high concentra-
tion (i.e., more efﬁcient in reaching a state closer to
energy equipartition, hence displaying a stronger mass-
dependence of their kinematics, Bianchini et al. 2016)
show a signiﬁcant difference in velocity dispersion, of
the order of 0.1-0.3 km s−1 (Simulation 2 and Simu-
lation 6), corresponding to 1-6% of the velocity dis-
persion. The effect is larger in the center where the
binary fraction increases. The low level of the bias in-
dicates that proper-motion data are less affected by bi-
naries than typical line-of-sight samples. Note that the
color-dependent bias due to the presence of binaries is
a generic result, merely due to the presence of a stel-
lar component more-massive than average on the red
side of the main sequence; however, the quantitative
details could depend on the speciﬁc initial conditions
adopted, in particular on the ability of efﬁciently distin-
guish binaries from single stars, the shape of the color-
magnitude diagram, and the photometric errors.

• With state-of-the-art HST proper-motion data (Bellini
et al. 2014; Watkins et al. 2015a,b) it is possible to
measure such low kinematic differences since sufﬁcient
stars are available to achieve low random errors. How-
ever, at this very low error level, other systematic ef-
fects can inﬂuence the measurements (e.g., contami-
nant stars, mismatched proper motions, or astrometric
blends, Bellini et al. 2014), making the detection of the
kinematic effects of binaries challenging. This suggests
that the kinematic impact of binaries, quantiﬁed in our
work, must be taken into account in the error budget
of any proper-motion analysis of HST data. This is
particularly important in the context of multiple stel-
lar populations, where different color bins could con-
tain different stellar populations, with possible intrin-
sically different kinematics (see Henault-Brunet et al.
2015; Bellini et al. 2015; Richer et al. 2013).

• We applied our analysis to the high-quality HST-
PROMO dataset of NGC 7078. The velocity disper-
sions are measured with an accuracy ∼ 1.5% and we
conﬁrm that no kinematic effects due to unresolved

binaries is detectable, consistent with the predictions
from our simulations for a low binary fraction GC
(< 5%). This analysis can be interpreted in the con-
text of multiple stellar populations as an indication of
the lack of signiﬁcant kinematic differences among the
stellar populations of NGC 7078.
