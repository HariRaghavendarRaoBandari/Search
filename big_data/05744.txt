Abstract

Numerous studies have examined the growth dynamics of Wolbachia within populations and the resultant

rate of spatial spread. This spread is typically characterised as a travelling wave with bistable local growth

dynamics due to a strong Allee eﬀect generated from cytoplasmic incompatibility. While this rate of spread

has been calculated from numerical solutions of reaction-diﬀusion models, none have examined the spectral

stability of such travelling wave solutions. In this study we analyse the stability of a travelling wave solution

generated by the reaction-diﬀusion model of Chan & Kim [4] by computing the essential and point spectrum

of the linearised operator arising in the model. The point spectrum is computed via an Evans function using

the compound matrix method, whereby we ﬁnd that it has no roots with positive real part. Moreover, the

essential spectrum lies strictly in the left half plane. Thus, we ﬁnd that the travelling wave solution found

by Chan & Kim [4] corresponding to competition between Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes

is linearly stable. Moreover, we employ a dimension counting argument to suggest that, under realistic

conditions, the wavespeed corresponding to such a solution is unique.

1 Introduction

Wolbachia are common endosymbiotic bacteria that are estimated to infect up to 66% of all insect species
[10]. They are primarily vertically transmitted and can induce reproductive phenotypes in its host to confer

a reproductive advantage and hence improve chances of persistence. A well studied induced reproductive phe-

notype is cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), whereby oﬀspring of infected males and uninfected females have an

increased probability of death. This has lead to the proposal of a deliberate Wolbachia introduction into wild

mosquito populations to reduce transmission of vector-borne diseases, since particular CI-inducing Wolbachia

strains have been shown to reduce proliferation of various viruses (see Brelsfoard & Dobson [3] and references

therein). Two particular CI-inducing strains of Wolbachia, WMel and WMelPop, have received much attention

due to evidence of these strains inhibiting dengue transmission in Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes.

Although CI has been proposed as a key mechanism for the success of Wolbachia-based strategies, ﬁtness

reducing phenotypes are also a result of certain Wolbachia strains. For example, both WMel and WMelPop re-

duce both fecundity and lifespan of infected females [15, 22, 23]. Turelli [20] ﬁrst showed that the amalgamation

of these Wolbachia-induced eﬀects result in a strong Allee eﬀect for an invasion, that is, infection is only success-

ful if initial infection densities are above the critical Allee threshold. This threshold has been found by various

modelling studies to be dependent on the fecundity cost of infection, the strength of CI in reducing oﬀspring from

infected males and uninfected females, and the probability of successful Wolbachia transmission [4, 8, 12, 16, 21].

Many studies have analysed the growth dynamics of a deliberate Wolbachia introduction via non-spatial mod-

els, but relatively few studies have studied the dynamics of the spatial spread (see Hancock & Godfray [9] and

Barton & Turelli [2] for examples). This study is motivated by the reaction-diﬀusion model of Chan & Kim

[4], who examine the spatial spread of Wolbachia in a homogeneous environment by incorporating slow and

fast compartments in their model. Chan & Kim [4] numerically show that there exists a travelling wave solu-

tion corresponding to a Wolbachia invasion, that is, competition between Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected

mosquitoes, and estimate the wavespeed corresponding to this solution. A simpliﬁed model which uses a

weighted average of the slow and fast diﬀusion coeﬃcients was found to yield similar wavespeeds. This model

assumes perfect vertical transmission of Wolbachia, an increased fecundity for infected individuals, longevity

reducing eﬀects of 10% and that Wolbachia infection induces CI. Here we perform a spectral stability analysis
by examining the linearised operator arising in this simpliﬁed model. We show that the essential spectrum is

bounded to the left-half plane for all relevant biological parameter values and show that the point spectrum

contains no elements in the right-half plane. Moreover, we show that there exists a travelling wave solution for

only a unique wavespeed.

2 Problem setup

The non-dimensionalised system of partial diﬀerential equations from Chan & Kim [4] is given by

ut = uxx − ρux + u(1 − S) − αµu,

vt = vxx − ρvx + F v(1 − S)(1 − shA) − µv,

(2.1)

where S = u + v and A = u/S. Following Chan & Kim [4], we let sh = 0.45, F = 1.0526, c = 0.027 and
µ = 0.0162, which correspond to parameter values for Aedes aegypti at 30◦C. The parameters F −1, µ and sh
correspond to the relative fecundity of infected females to uninfected females, mortality rate and probability of

embryo death due to cytoplasmic incompatibility, respectively. Additionally, we let α = 1.1, which reﬂects the

10% relative reduction in lifespan associated with the WMel strain of Wolbachia.

Converting to travelling wave coordinates z = x − (c + ρ)t , we have that (u(x, t), v(x, t)) = (u(z, t), v(z, t)).

To assess the stability of travelling wave solution ˆu and ˆv we need to locate the spectrum of the linearised
operator L.
If (L − λ)−1 does not exist or is unbounded for λ ∈ C, then λ is in the spectrum σ(L) of the
operator L. The complement of the spectrum in C is the resolvent set of L. Following Kapitula & Promislow
[11], we deﬁne ind(L) = dim[ker(L)] − codim[R(L)] as the Fredholm index of L, where R(L) denotes the range
of L. The spectrum of a Fredholm operator L is decomposed into two sets:

3

(i) The essential spectrum, deﬁned by

σess(L) = {λ ∈ C | λ − L is not Fredholm or λ − L is Fredholm, but ind(λ − L) (cid:54)= 0}.

(ii) The point spectrum, deﬁned by

σpt(L) = {λ ∈ C | ind(λ − L) = 0, but λ − L is not invertible}.

3 Essential spectrum

The PDE given in (2.2) is autonomous, and so the only non-constant coeﬃcients are due to the functions ˆu(z)
and ˆv(z) in the reaction terms. These are heteroclinic orbits in phase space (connecting e− = (1 − αµ, 0) and
e+ = (0, 1 − µ
F )) which decay exponentially as z → ±∞ as shown in Section 5. This shows that L is exponen-
tially asymptotic. From Kapitula & Promislow [11] it follows that L is a relatively compact perturbation of the
asymptotic operator L∞, deﬁned as the limit of L as z → ±∞ and equivalent to the operator T∞(0). Then by
Weyl’s Essential Spectrum Theorem, we have that σess(L) = σess(L∞), or equivalently σess(T ) = σess(T∞) [11].

A crucial concept behind the spectrum of an operator is the existence of an exponential dichotomy. Essen-

tially, this states that each solution to (2.6) decays exponentially either in forward or backward z. For spatially
constant matrices, the existence of an exponential dichotomy simply means that the matrix is hyperbolic. We

deﬁne the Morse index of a constant matrix A to be the dimension of the unstable subspace associated with A,
and let i±(λ) denote the Morse indices of the asymptotic matrices A±, given by Eq. (2.8) and Eq. (2.9). It can
be shown [11] that for λ ∈ C such that T∞ is Fredholm, we have ind(T∞ − λ) = i−(λ) − i+(λ). Thus, we can
characterise the essential spectrum of L∞ as

σess(L∞) = {λ ∈ C | i−(λ) (cid:54)= i+(λ)} ∪ {λ ∈ C | dim(Ec(A±(λ))) (cid:54)= 0} ,

(3.1)

4

where Ec denotes the center subspace associated with the asymptotic linearised system.

The spatial eigenvalues of A−(λ) and A+(λ) are respectively given by

These spatial eigenvalues are non-hyperbolic when η± = ik. Substituting this into Eq. (3.2) and (3.3) respec-
tively yields the dispersion relations

These form four parabolas in the complex plane parametrised by k. For λ in between the region bounded by
λ1,2− (k), A−(λ) has three stable eigenvalues and one unstable eigenvalue; to the left of the region A−(λ) has four
stable eigenvalues and to the right of the region A−(λ) has two stable and two unstable eigenvalues. This is
also true for λ1,2
+ (k) and A+(λ). Thus the essential spectrum is given by the region bounded between λ1− and
+, and also between λ2− and λ2
λ1

+; this is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1: The essential spectrum of L is given by λ in the shaded regions. The blue dashed and solid lines represent
λ1,2− and λ1,2
+ respectively. The red line indicates the absolute spectrum given by Eq. (3.6) and the red dot at the origin
represents an eigenvalue. Note that these are not drawn to scale for visualisation purposes.

It will be convenient for us later on to know the location of the so-called absolute spectrum. The absolute

spectrum is not spectrum per se, but its location characterises the breakdown of the analytic continuation (in
terms of the spectral parameter λ) of the stable and unstable eigenspaces of the matrices A±(λ). It thus follows
that the absolute spectrum coincides with a branch cut of the Evans function [11]. For the case at hand, the

5

ReλImλabsolute spectrum can be deﬁned [19] as the set in the complex plane where a pair of the eigenvalues of A+(λ)

have equal real parts. This is the set (cid:26)

We note that from Eq. (3.6), (3.4) and (3.5), the continuous and absolute spectrum are always bounded to the
left-half plane for biologically relevant parameter constraints F > 1, µ > 0, sh > 0 and α > 1.

4 Point spectrum

The existence of a travelling wave solution implies a heteroclinic connection in (2.4) between the equilibria
e− = (1− αµ, 0) and e+ = (0, 1− µ
F ). We denote the unstable subspace of the matrix A− by U− and the stable
subspace of the matrix A+ by S+. To the right of the essential spectrum, we have that the dimension of U−,
which we denote by k, and dimension of S+ sum to 4, the dimension of the entire phase space. For our case, k = 2.

The unstable eigenvalues of A− are given by

which has the property that D(λ) = 0 if and only if λ is in the point spectrum of the operator L. Roots of
the Evans function correspond to solutions of the boundary value problem deﬁned by Eq. (2.6), which decay
appropriately as z → ±∞.

4.1 Compound matrix method

The Evans function is numerically diﬃcult to compute due to the stiﬀness of the problem stemming from
the diﬃculty of resolving diﬀerent modes of growth and decay. For example, since we have that η−
1 > η−
2 ,
any numerical errors occurring when solving for w−
2 (0, λ) will grow at a rate proportionate to exp(η−
1 z). Thus,
2 (z, λ) are linearly independent at z = −∞, they quickly become numerically
although the solutions w−
linearly dependent. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this issue such as the method of continuous

1 (z, λ), w−

orthogonalisation, the compound matrix method, Magnus methods and Grassmanian spectral shooting [6, 7, 13,

17, 18]. Following Allen & Bridges [1], we employ the compound matrix method which converts the problem into
the six-dimensional wedge product space ∧2(C4), with basis B = {e1∧e2, e1∧e3, e1∧e4, e2∧e3, e2∧e4, e3∧e4},
where {e1, e2, e3, e4} is the standard basis for C4. The numerical advantage of this approach is that the

To check for eigenvalues of L with positive real part, we set up a closed semi-circle contour C excluding
the origin, as shown below in Figure 2. We let rs and rb denote the radius of the smaller and larger circular arc
respectively.

Figure 2: The contour C.

We compute the image of C under D(λ), which we denote as D[C], and show D[C] in Figure 3-4 for (rs, rb) =
(0.1, 10) and (0.001, 500). By the Argument Principle, the number of times f [C] winds around the origin is

equal to the number of zeroes of D(λ) in the interior of the region enclosed by C. Figures 3-5 show that the

winding number of D[C] around the origin is zero and thus there are no zeroes of the Evans function in the

respectively. The only roots of the Evans function are at λ = 0 and λ ≈ −0.0026075, the latter being the edge
of the absolute spectrum, which we denote by γA. The former is due to translational invariance of the travelling
wave solution (ˆu, ˆv), while the latter is due to γA being a branch point of D(λ). We note that the root at λ = 0
is simple, and because of translational invariance must persist throughout all nearby parameter regimes. We

have already shown that the root of the Evans function at the branch point is in the left half plane and thus

we conclude that no new eigenvalues can be introduced by perturbation.

Since system (2.1) has no spectrum in the right half plane, the solution given by ˆu and ˆv is spectrally sta-
ble. Moreover, as the linearised operator L is an exponentially asymptotic operator, we have that it is also a
sectorial operator [5, 11]. Thus, spectral stability of the travelling wave solution ˆu and ˆv also implies linear

stability. We refer the reader to Section 5 for details on computing ˆu and ˆv.

α = 1.1 and α = 1 respectively. The dashed lines in plot (a) mark the edge of the absolute spectrum corresponding to
each α. For α = 1.1, the only roots are at λ = 0 and at the edge of the absolute spectrum λ = −0.002607, whereas for
α = 1 we were unable to detect a zero at the edge of the absolute spectrum due to its proximity to the origin.

We note that for parameter values such that γA lies closer to the origin, for example α = 1 (corresponding to
γA ≈ −0.001435), the method described above fails to detect a zero for the Evans function evaluated at γA,
although the qualitative behaviour in the right-half plane remains the same. We show this in Figure 6.

To compute A(z, λ) explicitly at any z requires either a numerical or exact solution for ˆu(z) and ˆv(z) satisfying
Eq. (2.1). We use MATLAB’s bvp4c solver to ﬁnd a numerical solution corresponding to the case where the
populations represented by ˆu and ˆv are in competition. The boundary conditions listed in (2.6) are not suﬃcient
for bvp4c to ﬁnd a unique solution. We note that since the linearisation of (2.2) as z → ±∞ is given by
y(cid:48) = A∞(0)y, we have

respectively.

Due to the bistability in the system, and from the spatial dynamics of the PDE ut = uxx + u(1 − u)(u − a)
(essentially the Fisher-KPP equation with a strong Allee eﬀect in the growth dynamics, see Lewis & Kareiva
[14]), we expect that there is a unique wavespeed c = c∗ ≈ 0.027 for which there is a heteroclinic connection
between e− and e+ in system (2.2).

Linearising about e− and e+ shows that the dimensions of W u(e−) (the unstable manifold of e−) and W s(e+)
(the stable manifold of e+) are both equal to 2. We assume that these two manifolds are generic and in-
tersect tranversely, which we interpret as a biologically realistic assumption. Then we consider extending
system (2.2) with c(cid:48) = 0. Due to transversality, we have that codim(W u(e−) ∩ W s(e+)) = codim(W u(e−)) +
codim(W s(e+)) = 2 + 2, which leads to dim(W u(e−) ∩ W s(e+)) = 1. Figure 8 provides a schematic of this
argument.

6 Discussion

In this study we have shown the linear stability of a travelling wave solution to a model for Wolbachia spread.

This is achieved by computing the essential, point and absolute spectrum of the linearised operator and showing

the absence of spectrum in the right-half plane. We prove that the essential and absolute spectrum is bounded

to the left-half plane for all biologically relevant parameter settings. Due to the numerical nature of locating the

point spectrum, we only show that there is no point spectrum in the right-half plane for ﬁxed parameter values.

Our results suggest that although Wolbachia may be diﬃcult to establish in a local area due to a CI-induced

strong Allee eﬀect in the growth dynamics, once it is established the spread of infection is a stable phenomenon.

In addition to our study being an investigation of Wolbachia spread dynamics, we present our study as an

example of determining stability of travelling wave solutions in a system of PDEs. Models demonstrating such

solutions are ubiquitous, particularly as mathematical modelling is becoming increasingly integrated with the

scientiﬁc method. The tools we have used in this study can be applied to a wide variety of models currently

used in mathematical biology; we believe that their application will improve understanding of the dynamics

generated by a model and motivate research in more complicated biological models.

One of the key obstacles impeding the wider use of the tools in this study is the diﬃculty in computing the

point spectrum via the Evans function. There are two key diﬃculties regarding this. Firstly, numerical methods

for evaluating the Evans function sometimes fail, due to the evaluation requiring the solution to a stiﬀ problem.

Although in this study we have successfully used the compound matrix method, it is not guaranteed to work

for all cases. Secondly, evaluating the Evans function requires the solution whose stability we are interested

in. While obtaining such a solution is straightforward when the system of PDEs is exactly solvable, in many

cases it is not exactly solvable and instead one must rely on a numerical solution obtained through solving a

boundary value problem (see Section 5). Depending on the dimensionality of the problem and the dimensions

of the stable and unstable subspaces at the equilibria, this can be a non-trivial numerical problem.
