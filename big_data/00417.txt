DEGREE BOUNDS FOR SEMI-INVARIANT RINGS OF QUIVERS

HARM DERKSEN AND VISU MAKAM

Abstract. We use recent results on matrix semi-invariants to give degree bounds on gen-
erators for the ring of semi-invariants for quivers with no oriented cycles.

1. Introduction

In [3], we studied the left-right action of SLn × SLn on m-tuples of n× n matrices. Among
other things, we proved bounds for the degree of generators for the invariant ring. This ring
of invariants can be seen as the ring of semi-invariants for the m-Kronecker quiver for the
dimension vector (n, n). In this paper, we obtain bounds for the degree of generators for the
ring of semi-invariants for a quiver with no oriented cycles.

1.1. Quiver representations. A quiver is just a directed graph. Formally, a quiver Q is a
pair (Q0, Q1), where Q0 is a ﬁnite set of vertices, and Q1 is a ﬁnite set of arrows. For each
arrow a ∈ Q1, we denote its head and tail by ha and ta respectively. We ﬁx an inﬁnite ﬁeld
K. A representation V of Q over K is a collection of ﬁnite dimensional K-vector spaces
V (x), x ∈ Q0 together with a collection of K-linear maps V (a) : V (ta) → V (ha), a ∈ Q1.
The dimension vector of V is the function α : Q0 → Z≥0 such that α(x) = dim V (x) for all
x ∈ Q0.
≥0, we
deﬁne its representation space by:

Let Matp,q denote the set of p × q matrices over K. For a dimension vector α ∈ ZQ0

Rep(Q, α) = Ya∈Q1

Matα(ha),α(ta).

If V is a representation with dimension vector α and we identify V (x) ∼= K α(x) for all x, then
V can be viewed as an element of Rep(Q, α). Consider the group GL(α) = Qx∈Q0 GLα(x)
and its subgroup SL(α) =Qx∈Q0 SLα(x). The group GL(α) acts on Rep(Q, α) by:
(A(x) | x ∈ Q0) · (V (a) | a ∈ Q1) = (A(ha)V (a)A(ta)−1 | a ∈ Q1).
For V ∈ Rep(Q, α), choosing a diﬀerent basis means acting by the group GL(α). The GL(α)-
orbits in Rep(Q, α) correspond to isomorphism classes of representations of dimension α.

1.2. Invariants for quiver representations. The group GLn acts by simultaneous con-
jugation on Matm
n,n, the space of m-tuples of n × n matrices. Artin conjectured that in
characteristic 0, the invariant ring is generated by traces of words in the matrices. Procesi
proved this conjecture, and also showed that invariants of degree ≤ 2n − 1 generate the ring
of invariants (see [25]). It was shown by Razmyslov that invariants of degree ≤ n2 suﬃce
(see [26, ﬁnal remark]). A concise account of the above results can also be found in [11].

Le Bruyn and Procesi generalized the results to arbitrary quivers. They proved that the
ring of invariants K[Rep(Q, α)]GL(α) is generated by traces along oriented cycles. Using the
aforementioned bound, they showed that the invariants of degree ≤ N 2 generate the ring,
where N =Pi αi (see [21]).

1.3. Semi-invariants for quiver representations. From Le Bruyn and Procesi’s results
described above, we see that a quiver with no oriented cycles has no non-trivial invariants.
However, the ring of semi-invariants SI(Q, α) = K[Rep(Q, α)]SL(α) could still be interesting.

A multiplicative character of the group GLα is of the form

χσ : (A(x) | x ∈ Q0) ∈ GLα 7→ Yx∈Q0

det(A(x))σ(x) ∈ K ⋆,

where σ : Q0 → Z is called the weight of the character χσ. Deﬁne

SI(Q, α)σ = {f ∈ K[Rep(Q, α)] | ∀A ∈ GL(α) A · f = χσ(A)f}.

Then the ring of semi-invariants has a weight space decomposition

SI(Q, α) =Mσ

SI(Q, α)σ.

If σ · α = Px∈Q0 σ(x)α(x) 6= 0, then SI(Q, α)σ = 0. Assume that σ · α = 0. We can
write σ = σ+ − σ− where σ+(x) = max{σ(x), 0} and σ−(x) = max{−σ(x), 0}. Deﬁne
|σ|α = σ+ · α = σ− · α.
Now we deﬁne an n × n linear matrix

A : Mx∈Q0

V (x)σ+(x) → Mx∈Q0

V (x)σ−(x)

where each block Hom(V (x), V (y)) is of the form t1V (p1) + · · · + trV (pr), t1, t2, . . . , tr are
indeterminates and p1, p2, . . . , pr are all paths from x to y. We use diﬀerent indeterminates
for the diﬀerent blocks, so the linear matrix has m =Px∈Q0Py∈Q0 σ+(x)bx,yσ−(y) indeter-
minates where bx,y is the number of paths from x to y. We can write A = t1X1 +· · · + tmXm
with X1, . . . , Xm ∈ Matn,n. We have the following result (see [4, Corollary 3], [10] and [27]).
Theorem 1.1. The space SI(Q, α)σ is spanned by det(t1X1+· · ·+tmXm) with t1, . . . , tm ∈ K.
The ring SI(Q, α) is the ring of invariants for the action of the reductive group SLα on
the vector space Rep(Q, α). The ring of regular functions on Rep(Q, α) is a polynomial ring,
and has a natural grading by total degree. The group SLα acts on each graded piece, and
thus the ring SI(Q, α) inherits the grading:

SI(Q, α) = Md∈Z≥0

SI(Q, α)[d].

Note that we use SI(Q, α)[d] to denote the dth graded piece with respect to the total degree
grading, whereas we use SI(Q, α)σ to denote the weight space corresponding to the weight
σ. Theorem 1.1 gives a determinantal description for the semi-invariants of a given weight.
However, such a description of the invariants in terms of the total degree grading is not readily
available. On the other hand, several results in Computational Invariant Theory apply to
the total degree grading, and not directly to the weight space decomposition. The null cone
N ⊆ Rep(Q, α) is deﬁned as the zero set of the non-constant homogeneous invariants. From

2

the description in Theorem 1.1, it follows that the null cone is the zero set of the semi-
invariants for all nonzero weights. The null cone is an important tool in Computational
Invariant Theory.

Recall that ||α||1 = Pi∈Q0 |αi| and ||α||2 = (Pi∈Q0
Theorem 1.2. Let Q = (Q0, Q1) be a quiver with no oriented cycles, and let |Q0| = n. Then
the null cone for the action of SLα on Rep(Q, α) is deﬁned by semi-invariants for nonzero
weights σ such that |σ|α ≤

In characteristic 0, bounds on the degree of the invariants deﬁning the null cone can be

translated into bounds for the degree of generating invariants.

Theorem 1.3. Let Q = (Q0, Q1) be a quiver with no oriented cycles, and let |Q0| = n.
Assume char K = 0 and let r be the Krull dimension of SI(Q, α). The ring SI(Q, α) is

Note that dim(SI(Q, α)) ≤ dim Rep(Q, α), which depends on Q0 and Q1. We show that

using a theorem of Weyl, we can give a bound that depends only on n = |Q0| and α.

Even though our bounds are not polynomial in n = |Q0|, we give an example to show that
it is not possible to obtain general bounds that are polynomial. Indeed consider the quiver

Proposition 1.5. For the quiver Qn, and dimension vector α = (2, 3, . . . , 3, 1), the semi-
invariants of weights σ with |σ|α < 2n − 2 do not deﬁne the null cone, and hence do not
generate SI(Qn, α).

1.4. Organization. In Section 2, we describe a result in linear algebra that will be very
useful to get bounds. We recall relevant results from Computational Invariant Theory in
Section 3 and some recent results from [3] in Section 4.
In Section 5, we recall King’s
criterion for semi-stability and stability. We then use the King’s criterion and the result
from Section 2 to get bounds for the null cone in Section 6. We use the bounds on the
null cone to generate bounds for the degree of generators in Section 7, and in Section 8, we
remove the dependence on dim(SI(Q, α)). Finally in Section 9, we prove Proposition 1.5.

2. A result from linear algebra

For any vector w = (w1, w2, . . . , wn) ∈ Qn, recall that

Let ~v1, ~v2, . . . , ~vn−1 ∈ Zn
≥0 be linearly independent over Q, with ~v1 + ~v2 + · · · + ~vn−1 = ~v ∈
≥0. Considering each ~vi as a row vector, we can write a (n− 1)× n matrix M whose ith row
Zn
is ~vi. Since the ~vi are linearly independent over Q, the rank of this matrix is n− 1. Hence it
has a 1-dimensional kernel. The following proposition bounds the smallest nonzero integral
vector on this 1-dimensional kernel:

Proposition 2.1. Let ~v1, ~v2, . . . , ~vn−1, ~v and M be as above. Then there is a nonzero integral

vector ~u = (u1, u2, . . . , un) ∈ Ker(M) such that |ui| ≤(cid:18) ||~v||1
Proof. Let cM (i) denote the (n−1)×(n−1) minor of M obtained by removing the ith column.
Then deﬁne ui = (−1)icM (i). It is clear that ~u = (u1, u2, . . . , un) is an integral vector and

that it is in the kernel of M. Further, we have

3. Computational Invariant Theory

Let V be a rational representation of a linearly reductive group G. Then K[V ] is a
polynomial ring, and has a natural grading by total degree. The ring of invariants K[V ]G
inherits this grading. Further, we know that it is ﬁnitely generated since G is reductive
(see [13, 14, 22, 12]).

Deﬁnition 3.1. We deﬁne β(K[V ]G) to be the smallest integer D such that invariants of
degree ≤ D generate K[V ]G.

A set of homogeneous invariants f1, f2, . . . , fr is called a homogeneous system of pa-
rameters (hsop) if they are algebraically independent, and K[V ]G is a ﬁnite module over
K[f1, f2, . . . , fr]. In particular, the number of invariants in any hsop must be equal to the
Krull dimension of K[V ]G. The invariant ring K[V ]G is Cohen-Macaulay by the Hochster-
Roberts theorem, which implies that K[V ]G is in fact a free module over any hsop.

4

Deﬁnition 3.2. Null Cone : The null cone N is the zero set of all homogeneous invariant
polynomials of positive degree

N = {v ∈ V |f (v) = 0 f or all f ∈ K[V ]G
+}.

A set of algebraically independent homogeneous invariants f1, f2, . . . , fr form a hsop if and
only if their zero set coincides with the null cone (see [2, Lemma 2.4.5]). Kempf showed that
the Hilbert series of K[V ]G is a rational function of degree ≤ 0 (see [16]). From this, one can
deduce that if deg(fi) = di, then β(K[V ]G) ≤ d1 + d2 + · · · + dr. In [19, 20] Knop further
proved that the degree of the Hilbert series is in fact ≤ −r if G is a semisimple connected
group in characteristic 0 (see also [2, Theorem 2.6.2]).

Deﬁnition 3.3. We deﬁne γ(K[V ]G) to be the smallest integer D such that the non-constant
homogeneous invariants of degree ≤ D deﬁne the null cone.

Popov argued that one could use bounds for γ(K[V ]G) to get bounds for β(K[V ]G). Hence
one can use Kempf and Knop’s results on the Hilbert series to get bounds for β(K[V ]G) given
bounds on γ(K[V ]G). The ﬁrst author in [1] improved these bounds to one that is polynomial
in γ(K[V ]G).

Theorem 3.4 ([1]). For a rational representation V of a linearly reductive group G, we have

β(K[V ]G) ≤ max{2, 3

8r(γ(K[V ]G))2}.

Note that in characteristic 0, linearly reductive groups are precisely the reductive groups.
A more detailed treatment of the above results, as well as several other techniques for ﬁnding
degree bounds can be found in [2], see also [23, 24].

4. Degree bounds on matrix semi-invariants

In [3], we studied the left-right action of SLn × SLn on m-tuples on n × n matrices. Let
n,n]SLn×SLn be the ring of invariants. Studying linear subspaces of matrices,

R(n, m) = K[Matm
and the behaviour of ranks in tensor blow-ups, we proved:

Theorem 4.1 ([3]). We have the following bounds for invariants deﬁning the null cone:

√n2 − 1⌋ ≤ γ(R(n, m)) ≤ n(n − 1).
n⌊

In characteristic 0, we show the existence of a hsop in degree n(n − 1), and using the

bounds on Hilbert series given by Knop, we get bounds for β(R(n, m)).

Theorem 4.2 ([3]). Let char K = 0. We have:

(1) β(R(n, m)) ≤ mn4;
(2) For all m, β(R(n, m)) ≤ n6.
The second result follows from the ﬁrst using Weyl’s theorem on polarization of invariants

(see [18, Section 7.1, Theorem A]).

Given a character σ : Q0 → Z, we can consider the subring of semi-invariants SI(Q, α, σ) =
Ld∈Z≥0
SI(Q, α)dσ. The projective variety Proj(SI(Q, α, σ)), if non-empty, is a moduli space
for α-dimensional representations of Q (see [17]). A representation V ∈ Rep(Q, α) is called
σ-semistable if there exists an semi-invariant f ∈ SI(Q, α)dσ with f (V ) 6= 0 (see [17]).
The results on matrix semi-invariants mentioned above readily generalize to the subrings
SI(Q, α, σ).

5

Proposition 4.3 ([3]). Let Q = (Q0, Q1) be a quiver with no oriented cycles. Let σ ∈ ZQ0
be a weight. Then

SI(Q, α)dσ with f (V ) 6= 0;

(1) If V is σ-semistable, and d ≥ |σ|α − 1, then there exists a semi-invariant f ∈
(2) If char K = 0, then the ring SI(Q, α, σ) is generated in degree ≤ |σ|5
α.
Even though we know the bounds for these subrings, they do not immediately give bounds
on entire ring of semi-invariants, since there is no universal bound for |σ|α. Such a bound
does not exist even if we restrict to indivisible dimension vectors. In the next two sections,
we rectify this by showing that it suﬃces to consider only a ﬁnite subset of the dimension
vectors.

5. Stability conditions and the null cone

Fix a quiver Q = (Q0, Q1) with no oriented cycles and let |Q0| = n. There is a criterion
for deciding σ-semistability of a representation in terms of the dimension vectors of subrep-
resentations due to King (see [17]). We use the conventions in [6]. Given a weight σ and a
dimension vector β, we deﬁne σ(β) =Pi∈Q0

Theorem 5.1 ([17]). Let Q = (Q0, Q1) be a quiver with no oriented cycles, α be a dimension
vector, and σ be a weight. Then we have:

σiβi.

(1) A representation V ∈ Rep(Q, α) is σ-semistable if σ(dimV ) = 0 and σ(dimW ) ≤ 0
(2) A representation V ∈ Rep(Q, α) is σ-stable if σ(dimV ) = 0 and σ(dimW ) < 0 for

for all subrepresentations W ⊂ V ;
all proper subrepresentations 0 6= W ( V .

The set of σ-semistable representations form an abelian subcategory of the category of
ﬁnite dimensional representations of a quiver Q. The simple objects in the category are
precisely the stable representations. If V is σ-semistable and σ(dimW ) = 0 for some non-
zero proper subrepresentation W of V , then W and V /W are also σ-semistable. In fact, we
have a Jordan-H¨older ﬁltration 0 = V0 ( V1 ( · · · ( Vm = V . The composition factors
Vi/Vi−1 are unique upto rearrangement and isomorphism. Further these composition factors
are σ-stable representations. We can deﬁne grσ(V ) =Li
Remark 5.2. Let d ∈ Z>0. From Theorem 5.1, it follows that a representation V is σ-
semistable (resp. stable) if and only if V is dσ-semistable (resp. stable). Hence, in particular,
we have grσ(V ) = grdσ(V ).
Lemma 5.3. A representation V ∈ Rep(Q, α) is not in the null cone if and only if there
exists a nonzero weight σ such that V is σ-semistable.

Vi/Vi−1.

Proof. We have already remarked that the null cone is the zero set of the semi-invariants of
nonzero weights. Thus if a representation V is not in the null cone, then there is a semi-
invariant f ∈ SI(Q, α)σ for some nonzero weight σ such that f (V ) 6= 0. Consequently for
this σ, f is σ-semistable. Conversely, if V ∈ Rep(Q, α) is σ-semistable for some nonzero
weight σ, then there is an invariant f ∈ SI(Q, α)dσ such that f (V ) 6= 0 for some d ∈ Z>0.
Hence V is not in the null cone.

(cid:3)

6. Bounds for the null cone

Given a representation V ∈ Rep(Q, α), we denote by C(V ), the set of weights σ for which

V is σ-semistable, i.e,

C(V ) = {σ|V is σ-semistable}.

Notice that C(V ) ⊂ ZQ0 is cut out by a linear equation σ(α) = 0 and by linear inequalities
σ(dimW ) ≤ 0 for proper subrepresentations W of V . Let L be an extremal ray of C(V ). It
is clear that this extremal ray is deﬁned by degenerating a subset of the linear inequalities
to equalities. Hence, there exists a set of subrepresentations Wi, i ∈ I of V such that QL is
deﬁned by σ(α) = 0 and σ(dimWi) = 0 for i ∈ I.
Let σ be the smallest integral weight on L. Then since σ ∈ C(V ), we have that V is
σ-semistable. We can look at a Jordan-H¨older series 0 = V0 ( V1 ( · · · ( Vm = V . The
composition factors Vi/Vi−1 are σ-stable representations, and let αi := dimVi/Vi−1. Thus,
in particular we have σ(αi) = 0 for all i. It is easy to see that the inequalities σ(αi) = 0
will deﬁne QL. However, some of these linear equalities may be redundant. Since these
equalities deﬁne a 1-dimensional subspace, we can ﬁnd a subset of the αi’s of size n − 1, say
{β1, β2, . . . , βn−1}, such that σ(βi) = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 deﬁnes QL.
Proposition 6.1. Given a representation V ∈ Rep(Q, α) such that C(V ) is non-empty, V
is σ-semistable for some weight σ such that each coordinate of σ has size ≤(cid:18) ||α||1
Proof. Observe that QL is the kernel of the (n− 1)× n matrix whose rows are the dimension
vectors βi. Since σ is the smallest integral vector in QL, we have that each coordinate of σ
is bounded by (cid:18) ||α||1
We can now translate this into a bound for |σ|α.

2M||α||1. (cid:3)
that since σ(α) = 0, we have
Proof of Theorem 1.2. Given V ∈ Rep(Q, α) which is not in the null cone, we have that
C(V ) is nonzero by Lemma 5.3. Hence there exists some σ with |σ|α ≤ ||α||n
2(n−1)n−1 , such
that V is σ-semistable. Then by the ﬁrst part of Proposition 4.3, there is an semi-invariant
f ∈ SI(Q, α)dσ that does not vanish on V for each d ≥ |σ|α − 1. Observe that |dσ|α = d|σ|α.
Taking d = |σ|α gives the required conclusion.
Remark 6.3. It might seem very wasteful to ﬁnd bounds using an extremal ray L, as it
is very likely that smaller weights lie in the interior of C(V ). However, observe that if σ is
an integral weight on an extremal ray L of C(V ), then for grσ(V ) we have C(grσ(V )) = L.
Hence these extremal rays cannot be avoided.

7. Bounds for generating semi-invariants

The ring SI(Q, α) has two natural gradings. We have the weight space decomposi-

tion SI(Q, β) = Lσ SI(Q, α)σ. We also have the natural grading inherited from viewing

K[Rep(Q, α)] as a polynomial ring. While the weight space decomposition is the more inter-
esting one, all the results from Computational Invariant Theory hold for the latter grading.
In the previous section, we found bounds for invariants deﬁning the null cone in terms of
the weight space decomposition. In order to use Theorem 3.4, we must switch to the latter
grading.
Lemma 7.1. Let f ∈ SI(Q, α)σ, then its homogeneous components are non-trivial only for
degrees between |σ|α and n|σ|α.
Proof. A set of semi-invariants spanning f ∈ SI(Q, α)σ was given in Theorem 1.1. A semi-
invariant in this set is given by the determinant of a matrix, whose size is |σ|α. The matrix
is described in block form, where each block deﬁnes a linear combinations of paths between
two diﬀerent vertices. Such paths have length at least 1 and at most n. Hence the entries of
this matrix are polynomials whose homogeneous components are non-trivial only for degrees
between 1 and n.
(cid:3)

The above lemma can then be used to convert the bounds given in Theorem 1.2 with

respect to weight spaces to one in the total degree grading.

Corollary 7.2. The null cone for the action of SLα on Rep(Q, α) is deﬁned by homogeneous
invariants of degree ≤

Remark 7.4. The bounds given in Theorem 1.3 depend on dim(SI(Q, α)). Kac gave a
formula (see [15]) for dim(SI(Q, α)) in terms of the canonical decomposition. There is in
fact an eﬃcient algorithm to compute the canonical decomposition due to the ﬁrst author
and Weyman, see [5]. More importantly, as remarked in the introduction, dim(SI(Q, α)) is

bounded by dim(Rep(Q, α)) =Pa∈Q1 α(ha)α(ta).

8. Removing dependence on dim SI(Q, α)

The bounds in Theorem 1.3 depend on |Q0| = n, α and dim(SI(Q, α)). Note that
dim(SI(Q, α)) depends on Q1. We now show how one can use Weyl’s theorem on polar-
ization of invariants to remove the dependence on dim(SI(Q, α)), and get a bound which is
purely in terms of |Q0| = n and α.

8

Given a quiver Q = (Q0, Q1) with no oriented cycles, we can label the vertices 1, 2, . . . , n
so that for every arrow, ta < ha. Let n(i, j) denote the number of arrow with tail i and head
j. Fix a dimension vector α = (α1, α2, . . . , αn). Now, observe that

Rep(Q, α) =Mi<j

Matn(i,j)
αj ,αi .

Observe further that each Matαj ,αi is a representation of GLα as well as SLα. Observe
that dim Matαj ,αi = αiαj. Hence, as a consequence of Weyl’s theorem on polarization of
invariants (see [28, II.5, Theorem 2.5A] and [18, Section 7.1,Theorem A]), we can obtain the
αj ,αi]SLα. See also

semi-invariant ring SI(Q, α) by the process of polarization from K[Li<j

[7, Theorem 0.1] for a version that is better suited to our situation. In other words, for the
purposes of ﬁnding a bound on the generating invariants, we can assume n(i, j) = αiαj.

Matαiαj

Deﬁne a quiver eQ whose vertex set is 1, 2, . . . , n, and has αiαj arrows from i to j. The

above discussion can be summarized as follows:

Proposition 8.1. Assume char K = 0, then we have

Proof of Corollary 1.4. For eQ, we have:

β(SI(Q, α)) ≤ β(SI(eQ, α)).

We look at two particular indecomposable representations. The representation

V = K

( 0

K 2

is an indecomposable representation for the dimension vector (1, 2). It is easy to check

that V is σ-semistable precisely when σ ∈ Z>0(2,−1). Similarly, the representation

( 1 0 )

W =K 2

K

( 0 1 )

is an indecomposable representation for the dimension vector (2, 1). Once again, it is easy

to check that W is σ-semistable precisely when σ ∈ Z>0(1,−2).
Proof of Proposition 1.5. Consider the quiver Qn, and observe that the odd vertices are
sources and the even vertices are sinks. For any i ∈ {1, 2 . . . , n − 1}, one of i and i + 1 is a
source and the other is a sink. Let ψi be the embedding of the 2-Kronecker quiver, that maps
the vertices to i and i + 1, with source begin mapped to source and sink to sink. Under this
embedding, we see that ψi(V ) and ψi(W ) are indecomposable representations of the quiver
Qn. We consider the representation

R = ψ1(V ) ⊕ ψ2(W ) ⊕ ψ3(V )· · ·
= Mi odd

ψi(V ) ⊕ Mi even

ψi(W ).

We have dim(R) = (2, 3, 3, . . . , 3, 1). Moreover, R is σ-semistable for the indivisible inte-
gral weight σ = (−1, 2,−4, 8, . . . ). Since R is a direct sum of indecomposables, it suﬃces
to check σ-semistability of these indecomposables. That each of these indecomposables is
σ-semistable follows from the above discussion above on 2-Kronecker quivers. Thus, in par-
ticular, C(R) is non-empty, and R is not in the null cone.

Moreover, we have that R is a direct sum of n − 1 indecomposables, and their dimension
vectors are linearly independent vectors, and hence it follows from King’s stability conditions
that C(R) is at most 1-dimensional. Since C(R) is non-empty, and (−1, 2,−4, 8, . . . ) is indi-
visible, we have that C(R) = Z≥0(−1, 2,−4, 8, . . . ). More concretely, we have the condition
that σ ∈ C(R), then σ is in the kernel of

The kernel of the above matrix is precisely Q-span of (−1, 2,−4, 8, . . . ), and the smallest
integral vector in this 1-dimensional subspace is (−1, 2,−4, 8, . . . ) by virtue of being indivis-
ible. For the weight σ = (−1, 2,−4, 8, . . . ), we get |σ|α = 2n − 2 by computation. Thus in
this case, the semi-invariants of weights σ with |σ|α < 2n − 2 do not deﬁne the null cone.

Remark 9.1. For any given quiver, one might be able to generate stronger bounds by
improving the estimates we make at various stages of obtaining our bounds.
