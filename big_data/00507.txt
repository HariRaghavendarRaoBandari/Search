Abstract

In this paper, we give a classiﬁcation of orientation reversing periodic
automorphisms on closed surfaces which generalizes the theory of Nielsen
for the orientation preserving periodic automorphisms.

On one hand, we give a group of data for each orientation reversing
periodic map such that two periodic maps with the same data must be
conjugate with each other. On the other hand, we give the criterion to
judge when two diﬀerent groups of data correspond to the same conjugate
class.

As an application of the results of this paper, we will show that a given
orientation reversing periodic map on Σg with period larger than or equal
to 3g must be conjugate with the power of a list of particular types of
periodic maps.

Homology and orientation reversing periodic

maps on surfaces

Haibin Hang

March 7, 2016

1 Introduction

A natural idea to consider about the conjugate class of periodic map f with
period n on compact surface Σ is to consider about its induced branched cov-
ering πf from Σ to the orbit space Σ/f . Let Bf be the set of branch points,
there is a well-deﬁned homomorphism ωf : H1(Σ/f − Bf ) → Zn. In a paper
of Nielsen [5], he proved that if f is orientation preserving, the conjugate class
of f is determined by the values of ωf at the boundary loops of Σ/f − N (Bf ),
where N (Bf ) is a tubular neighborhood of Bf .

Afterwards, the classiﬁcation of symmetries on surfaces is encompassed in
the study of the structure of NEC groups, which is based on the classiﬁca-
tion theorem of A.M. Macbeath [1] and his approach to surface automorphisms
as explained in his paper [2]. This approach was used by E. Bujalance and
D. Singerman [3] to classify period 2 orientation reversing automorphisms on
Riemann surfaces. Then in E. Bujalance and A.F. Costa’s paper [4], they char-
acterized the conjugacy classes of orientation reversing periodic automorphisms
on Riemann surfaces with period 2p, here p a prime integer.

Some other facts we know is given by J.J. Etayo [9] and S.C. Wang [8]: If
g ≥ 2 is even, the largest possible period of an orientation reversing periodic
map on Σg is attainable by 4g + 4; If g ≥ 2 is odd, the largest possible period
of an orientation reversing periodic map on Σg is attainable by 4g − 4.

In this paper we ﬁnd out that when f is orientation reversing and we look
at the value of ωf not only at the boundary loops of Σ/f − N (Bf ) but also at
a set of one-sided loops (since Σ/f may be nonoreintable), then the conjugate
class of f is determined. From this point of view, we build up a complete theory
about orientation reversing periodic maps. Particularly, the corollary 5.14 would
greatly generalize the results in the paper [3] and [4] mentioned above. And in
section 6, we would give a detailed depict of orientation reversing periodic maps
with period n > 2(g − 1) and give a list of all those with period n ≥ 3g up to
conjugacy. An interesting result I would like to mention here is corollary 6.10:
if g > 3 is odd, all the possible orientation reversing periodic maps with period
n ≥ 3g are conjugate with a particular map with period 4g − 4.

2 Preliminaries

Along this paper, we use symbols like Σ, Σg and Στ,e to represent a oriented
compact surface, an oriented closed surface with genus g and an oriented com-
pact surface with genus g and boundary components number e. We use symbols
like Nτ,e to represent a non-orientable compact surface with genus τ and bound-
ary components number e. And we use N (·) to denote a tubular neighborhood
of some subset on the underground surface.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A homeomorphism f from a compact surface Σ to itself is said
to be a periodic map of period n if f n = idΣ and n is the smallest positive integer
that satisﬁes this condition.

Deﬁnition 2.2. A point x on Σ is called a multiple point of f if there is an
integer 0 < t < n such that f t(x) = x. If t is the smallest possible integer then
t|n. We call t the orbit length of x and we call n/t the multiplicity of x.
In the following, we denote the set of points with orbit length t by W t

f . And

let Wf be the set of all multiple points of f , then Wf = ⊔t<nW t
f .

It’s well-known that f can be realized as an isometry under some constant
curvature metric on the surface Σ, then locally at each ﬁxed point, f is a rotation
or reﬂection and we have the following two lemmas:

Lemma 2.1. If f preserves orientation and Fix(f ) 6= ∅, then each point of
Fix(f ) is isolated and # Fix(f ) is ﬁnite.

Lemma 2.2. If f reverses orientation and Fix(f ) 6= ∅, then Fix(f ) is disjoint
union of simple curves and the period of f must be 2.

Given a multiple point x ∈ W t

f , it’s clear that x is a ﬁxed point of n/t-

periodic map f t. Thus we have:

Corollary 2.3. If f preserves orientation and Wf 6= ∅, then Wf contains only
ﬁnite number of points.

If f reverses orientation, then f t preserves (reverses) the orientation when t

is even (odd). Thus we have:

Corollary 2.4. Suppose that f reverses orientation. If t is even and W t
then it contains only ﬁnite number of points; If t is odd and W t
disjoint union of simple curves and the period of f must be 2t.

f 6= ∅,
f 6= ∅, then it is

Deﬁnition 2.3. For two periodic maps f on Σ and f ′ on Σ′, if there exists
an orientation preserving homeomorphism h : Σg → Σ′
g such that h(Wf ) = Wf ′
and f ′ ◦ h = h ◦ f holds on a nonempty tubular neighborhood N (Wf ∪ ∂Σ), we
say that f and f ′ are locally conjugate. If furthermore, f ′ ◦ h = h ◦ f holds on
Σ, we say that f and f ′ are conjugate.

The quotient space Σ/f obtained by identifying x with f (x) is also a compact
surface. Let πf : Σ → Σ/f be the quotient map. Then πf is an n-fold branched
covering ramiﬁed at Bf = πf (Wf ).

Deﬁnition 2.4. For any simple loop γ on Σ/f − Bf , π−1
f (γ) is disjoint union
of simple loops and we call the components number t the orbit length of γ.
Then each component ˜γ ⊂ Σ is an n/t covering of γ and we call q = n/t the
multiplicity of the loop γ or ˜γ. The map f t restricted on ˜γ is conjugate with
eiθ 7→ ei(θ+2π p
q ) for some p, here up − vq = 1 for some u = p−1 mod q. We
call p/q the rotation number of f t. And [t, q, u] is call the the valency of γ or ˜γ.

We choose a point x in Σ/f − Bf and a point ˜x in π−1

f (x), then deﬁne a

homomorphism Ωf : π1(Σ/f − Bf , x) → Zn as follows:

For any loop γ ⊂ Σ/f − Bf with the base point x, let [γ] be the element of
π1(Σ/f − Bf , x) represented by γ. Let ˜γ be the lift of γ on Σ which begins from
˜x. There is a positive integer r less than or equal to n such that the terminal
point of ˜γ is f r(˜x). We deﬁne Ωf ([γ]) = r mod n. Since Zn is an abelian group,
the homomorphism Ωf induces a homomorphism ωf : H1(Σ/f − Bf ) → Zn.

Lemma 2.5. For any simple loop γ ⊂ Σ/f − Bf with valency [t, q, u], we have
t = gcd{ωf (γ), n}, q = n/t, u = ωf (γ)

.

t

Proof. Since f t restricted on ˜γ has rotation number p/q and up−vq = 1, we have
utp − vn = t and t = gcd{ut, n}. Then f tu restricted on ˜γ has rotation number
1/q and maps ˜γ(0) to ˜γ(1). Hence ωf (γ) = ut and the statement follows.

In the following sections we would show how a group of data derived from

homomorphism ωf can determine the conjugate class of f .

3 The conjugate class of orientation preserving

periodic maps

In this section we look at the case when f preserves orientation of a bounded
oriented surface Σ. In this case, Σ/f is also a bounded surface with induced
orientation from Σ.

By lemma 2.3, Bf = πf (Wf ) is ﬁnit. We let Bf = {q1, q2, · · · , qb} and let
∂(Σ/f ) = ⊔c
j=1δj. Then Σ/f − N (Bf ) has b + c boundary loops, each of which
has induced orientation. We use Sqi to denote each boundary loop around qi.

Deﬁnition 3.1. For each branch point qi, we refer the valency of qi to be the
valency of the simple loop Sqi around qi.

Lemma 3.1. Given two orientation preserving periodic maps f on Σ and f ′ on
Σ′. If Bf ∪ ∂(Σ/f ) 6= ∅ and there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism
¯h : Σ/f → Σ′/f ′, such that

1. ¯h(Bf ) = Bf ′

4

2. for each qi ∈ Bf , qi and ¯h(qi) have the same valency
3. for each δj ⊂ ∂(Σ/f ), δj and ¯h(δj) have the same valency

Then f and f ′ are locally conjugate.

Theorem 3.2. [5] If two homeomorphic compact oriented surfaces undergo
periodic, orientation preserving transformations f and f ′, respectively, of the
same period, then f and f ′ are conjugate if and only if they are locally conjugate.

Let h = genus(Σ/f ), θi = ωf (Sqi ) and ηj = ωf (δj ). By lemma 2.5, lemma
3.1 and theorem 3.2, the data [h, n; (θ1, · · · , θb); (η1, · · · , ηc)] determines a peri-
odic map up to conjugacy. The Hurwitz realization problem for cyclic branched
covering gives us the following suﬃcient and necessary condition for the data
[h, n; (θ1, · · · , θb); (η1, · · · , ηc)] to correspond to an orientation preserving peri-
odic map.

Theorem 3.3. There is an orientation preserving periodic map of period n on
compact orientable surface of genus τ with the data [h, n; (θ1, · · · , θb); (η1, · · · , ηc)]
if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

1. θi 6= 0 mod n, i = 1, · · · , b

2. θ1 + · · · + θb + η1 + · · · + ηc = 0 mod n

3. If h = 0, then gcd{θ1, · · · , θb, η1, · · · , ηc} = 1 mod n

4. 2τ − 2 = n(cid:16)2h − 2 +Pb

In particular, for orientation preserving periodic map f on a closed surface

Σg, we have c = 0. Then

Deﬁnition 3.2. For each qi ∈ Bf , let [ti, qi, ui] be its valency, then the expres-
sion V = (n, u1/q1 + · · · + ub/qb) is called the total valency of f .

Corollary 3.4. Suppose that f has total valency V = (n, u1/q1+· · ·+ub/qb) and
Σg/f is a sphere, then for each 1 ≤ i ≤ b, lcm{q1, · · · , qi−1, ˆqi, qi+1, · · · , qb} = n,
here ˆqi means qi is omitted.

Proof. By theorem 3.3, gcd{θ1, · · · , θb} = 1 mod n. By lemma 2.5, we have

θi = ui

4 The data for orientation reversing periodic

maps

In the following sections we will consider orientation reversing periodic map f
of period n = 2m on closed surface Σg. Similar to the method for the orienta-
tion preserving case, we intend to ﬁnd a group of data derived from the map
ωf : H1(Σg/f − Bf ) → Zn to depict the conjugate class of f .

Since f 2 preserves the orientation, the quotient map πf 2 : Σg → Σg/f 2
which identiﬁes x with f 2(x) on Σg gives us a closed oriented quotient surface.
And f induces a 2-periodic orientation reversing map ¯f : Σg/f 2 → Σg/f 2 such
that ¯f ◦ πf 2 = πf 2 ◦ f . Then we have a quotient map π ¯f : Σg/f 2 → Σg/f . In
particular, π ¯f ◦ πf 2 = πf .

Following lemma 2.2, we suppose that Fix( ¯f ) (if not empty) is disjoint union

of k simple circles σ1, · · · , σk. Let δj = π ¯f (σj ), we have ∂(Σg/f ) = ⊔k

j=1δj.

Following corollary 2.4, we suppose the isolated branch points of πf to be

{q1, · · · , qb}, which is exactly π ¯f (Bf 2 ).

Then Bf = π ¯f (Fix( ¯f )) ⊔ π ¯f (Bf 2 ) = ⊔k

j=1δj ⊔ {q1, · · · , qb}. We denote the
boundary components of Σg/f − N (Bf ) by Sqi , i = 1, · · · , b and Sδj , j =
1, · · · , k.

As what we did for orientation preserving periodic maps, we can look at
the value of ωf at each Sqi and Sδj . But the problem is that Σg/f may be
non-orientable, which means we do not have well-deﬁned orientations for Sqi
and Sδj . Correspondingly, we can not decide the signs of ωf (Sqi ) and ωf (Sδj )
in Zn.

But we can cut Σg/f along a sequence of disjoint one-sided simple closed
curves ιl, l = 1, · · · , s (the tubular neighborhood of each ιl is homeomorphic
to M¨obius band), such that the result surface, denoted by Σh,k+s is orientable.
We can give Σh,k+s an arbitrary orientation, which induces orientation on each
of the boundary components of Σh,k+s − N (Bf ). Now Σg/f − N (Bf ) is the
quotient space of Σh,k+s − N (Bf ), where the quotient map is 2-fold covering
when restricted on the preimage of each ιl and is one-to-one elsewhere. Hence
we would have induced orientation on each ιl, Sqi and Sδj . Now we reverse the
order of this procedure and give the following two deﬁnitions:

Deﬁnition 4.1. When Σg/f is non-orientable, a sequence of disjoint, simple
and one-sided loops ιl : {eiθ} → Σg − Bf , l = 1, · · · , s are said to be co-oriented
if

1. when we cut Σg/f along ⊔s

l=1ιl, we get an orientable surface Σh,k+s

2. we can give Σh,k+s an orientation such that the induced orientation on

each of ιl is the same as their induced orientation from {eiθ}.

Deﬁnition 4.2. Given co-oriented one-sided loops {ι1, · · · , ιs} on Σg/f , where
s = 0 if Σg/f is orientable. We can apply the map ωf : H1(Σg/f − Bf ) → Zn
and obtain well-deﬁned data [h, n; (· · · , ωf (Sqi ), · · · ); (· · · , ωf (Sδj ), · · · ); (· · · , ωf (ιl), · · · )],

6

which we call the data of f based on co-oriented one-sided loops {ι1, · · · , ιs}, or
simply the data of f .

The main theorem of this section is:

Theorem 4.1. For any two orientation reversing periodic maps, if we choose
a set of co-oriented one-sided loops for each of them and get exactly the same
data, then these two maps must be conjugate with each other.

Before giving the proof of this theorem, we need to do much preparatory

work.
Lemma 4.2. When we cut Σg/f 2 along Fix( ¯f ) = ⊔k
connected if and only if Σg/f is non-orientable.

j=1σj, the result surface is

Proof. If the result surface is connected, we choose an arbitrary point x ∈
Σg/f 2 − Fix( ¯f ) and a simple path α : [0, 1] → Σg/f 2 − Fix( ¯f ) from x to ¯f (x).
Since ¯f is orientation reversing, we are able to go around the loop π ¯f (α) on
Σg/f and come back to π ¯f (x) with the opposite orientation. Hence Σg/f is
non-orientable.

If the result surface is disconnected, then ¯f permutate its components. Hence
the components number is two and each of the components is homeomorphic to
Σg/f . Hence Σg/f is orientable.

For each one-sided loop ιl, let σk+l = π−1

¯f (ιl) be its lift on Σg/f 2. Fol-
lowing lemma 4.2, we cut Σg/f 2 along Fix( ¯f ) ⊔ π−2
j=1 σj and
get two oriented compact components denoted by Σ+
h,k+s. Each of
these components is homeomorphic to the result surface obtained when we cut
Σg/f along ⊔s
l=1ιl. And they induce opposite orientations on their common
boundaries, correspondingly on each ιl, l = 1, · · · , s. In the following we always
suppose that the induced orientation of each loop ιl from Σ+
h,k+s is the same as
their given orientation.

¯f (⊔s
h,k+s and Σ−

l=1ιl) = ⊔k+s

Lemma 4.3. The orbit length tj of σj, j = 1, · · · , k + s is odd.
Proof. It’s clear that πf 2 : π−1
f 2 (σj ) → σj is an m-fold covering, then we know
f 2 (σj ) is disjoint union of simple circles on Σg. From ¯f (σj) = σj , we know
that π−1
that for each circle ∆ ⊂ π−1
r=1f r(∆).
Because the orbit space of these circles f r(∆), r = 1, 2, · · · , tj under the action
of f 2 has only one component, we can deduce that tj must be an odd integer.

f 2 (σj), f (∆) ⊂ π−1

f 2 (σj ). Thus π−1

f 2 (σj ) = ⊔tj

Lemma 4.4. If Fix( ¯f ) 6= ∅ (k > 0), then m is odd.

Proof. Similar to the proof of the lemma 4.3, we suppose that x ∈ Fix( ¯f ) and
π−1
f 2 (x) = {˜x1, · · · , ˜xm}. The orbit space of {˜x1, · · · , ˜xm} under the action of
f 2 is x ∈ Σg/f 2, hence m must be odd.

Theorem 4.5. When we cut Σg along the circles in π−1
surface has exactly 2 components.

f 2 (⊔k+s

j=1 σj), the result

7

Proof. We know that each component is a compact surface and f induces a
permutation among these components {Σ(λ)}. Choose one of these components,
denoted by Στ,e. Consider the set ⊔d
i=1f i(Στ,e), with d the smallest positive
integer such that f d(Στ,e) = Στ,e.

Choose a circle ∆j ⊂ π−1

f 2 (σj ) and its tubular neighborhood N (∆j) = S1 ×
(−1, 1) in Σg. When we cut along ∆j, we get S1 × [0, 1) and S1 × (−1, 0], each
of which is the neighborhood of a boundary of some component Σ(λ).

f tj is a rotation when restricted on ∆j. By lemma 4.3, tj is odd and f tj (S1 ×
(−1, 0]) = S1 ×[0, 1). Hence if S1 ×[0, 1) ⊂ ⊔d
i=1f i(Στ,e), we have S1 ×(−1, 0] =
i=1f i(Στ,e). This tells us that all the boundary circles of
f tj (S1 × [0, 1)) ⊂ ⊔d
i=1f i(Στ,e) can be paired with each other, such that if we glue each pair into
⊔d
one circle properly, we get a both open and closed subset of Σg, hence this
subset is Σg itself.

By the above analysis, in particular, we know that each component contains
equal number of circles from the set of 2tj circles, generated when we cut Σg
along π−1
f 2 (σj ). This implies that d|2tj. Again, tj must be an odd integer, then:
If d is an odd integer, we have d|tj and f tj = (f d)aj for some integer aj. This
implies that if S1 × [0, 1) ⊂ Στ,e, we have S1 × (−1, 0] = (f d)aj (S1 × [0, 1)) ⊂
(f d)aj (Στ,e) = Στ,e. And all the circle boundaries of Στ,e can be paired with
each other, such that when we glue each pair into one circle properly, we get
a both open and closed subset of Σg and we know that it is Σg itself. This
means that d = 1. Then Στ,e/f 2 = Σ+
h,k+s, which contradicts to the
continuation of quotient map πf 2 .

h,k+s ⊔ Σ−

Hence d is even and we have (d/2)|tj. Then f tj = (f d/2)aj for some odd
integer aj. This implies that if S1 × [0, 1) ⊂ Στ,e, we have S1 × (−1, 0] =
(f d/2)aj (S1 × [0, 1)) ⊂ f d/2(Στ,e). In general, each circle boundary of Στ,e can
be paired with the one in f d/2(Στ,e), such that when we glue each pair into one
circle properly, we get a both open and closed subset of Σg and we know that
it is Σg itself. This means that d = 2.

By the above theorem, we will get two components Σ+

τ,e and Σ−

τ,e when we

cut Σg along π−1

pre-data of f .

Proof. For σj, j = 1, · · · , k, we pick x ∈ σj and choose ˜x ∈ π−1
f 2 (x). Then there
are m points in the orbit of ˜x under the action of f and there are m/tj points
in the orbit of ˜x under the action of f tj , thus qj = m/tj. We can take a tubular
neighborhood of a loop ∆j ⊂ π−1
f 2 (σj ), homeomorphic to S1 × [−1, 1]. Then the
map f tj on this neighborhood is conjugate with

odd and gcd{2pj, qj} = 1. Since f 2tj has rotation number 2pj/qj, suppose
i 2π
u(2pj) − vqj = 1, we have f 2utj (ei0, 1) = (e

ωf (Sδj ) = 2utj. From pj(2utj) − vm = tj we have tj = gcd{ωf (Sδj ), m}. From

qk+l = n/tk+l. We can choose a suﬃciently small neighborhood of a circle

Based on the proof of the above lemma, we also have:

Lemma 4.8. The data of f and the pre-data of f based on co-oriented one-
sided loops {ι1, · · · , ιs} satisfy: ωf (Sqi ) = 2θi, i = 1, 2, · · · , b; ωf (Sδj ) = 2ηj,
j = 1, 2, · · · , k; ωf (ιl) = ηk+l mod m, l = 1, 2, · · · , s.
Proof of theorem 4.1. Suppose that after cutting Σg/f and Σ′
chosen two sets of co-oriented one-sided loops we obtain Σ+
same data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ1, · · · , ζs)].

For each boundary component σj ⊂ Σ+

h,k+s, ¯h+(σj ) is the boundary com-
h,k+s. By lemma 4.7, we can ﬁnd out the components number tj
f 2 (σj ) and the rotation number pj/qj of the map f tj restricted on a loop

f 2 (σj ). Then the map πf 2 : ∆j → σj is an m/tj-fold covering.

For convenient, we give these boundary loops ∆j, h+(∆j ), σj and ¯h+(σj )

Then we can make an isotopy of ¯h+ on the tubular neighborhood of σj on

Theorem 4.9. There is an orientation reversing periodic map of period n = 2m
on closed orientable surface of genus g with data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ1, · · · , ζs)]
if and only if the following conditions are satisﬁed:

1. k + s > 0

2. When m even, k = 0

3. ζl is odd for l = 1, 2, · · · , s

4. [h, m; (θ1, · · · , θb); (η1, · · · , ηk, ζ1, · · · , ζs)] is the data of an orientation pre-

Let tj, pj and qj , j = 1, 2, · · · , k + s be given by formulas in lemma 4.7.
When k > 0, m is odd and tj = gcd{2ηj, m} is odd. Since ζl is odd, we have
tk+l = gcd{ζl, n} to be odd.

For each boundary component σj of Σh,k+s = Στ,e/ψ, by lemma 2.5, there
are tj components in π−1

5 The equivalent relations of the data

Given data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ1, · · · , ζs)] satisfying the con-
ditions listed in the theorem 4.9.

Let d = 1 if h > 0 and d = gcd{θ1, · · · , θb, η1, · · · , ηk} if h = 0.
Suppose that τ , ρ and σ are permutations of {1, 2, · · · , b}, {1, 2, · · · , k} and

{1, 2, · · · , s}.

Now we deﬁne the following equivalent relations:

(R0)[h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ1, · · · , ζs)] is equivalent with

[h, 2m; (2θτ (1), · · · , 2θτ (b)); (2ηρ(1), · · · , 2ηρ(k)); (ζσ(1), · · · , ζσ(s))]

(R1)[h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ1, · · · , ζs)] is equivalent with

[h, 2m; (−2θ1, · · · , −2θb); (−2η1, · · · , −2ηk); (−ζ1, · · · , −ζs)]

(R2)[h, 2m; (· · · , 2θi, · · · ); (· · · , 2ηj, · · · ); (· · · , ζl, · · · , ζs)] (s > 0) is equivalent with

[h, 2m; (· · · , −2θi, · · · ); (· · · , 2ηj, · · · ); (· · · , ζl, · · · , ζs + 2θi)], 1 ≤ i ≤ b and
[h, 2m; (· · · , 2θi, · · · ); (· · · , −2ηj, · · · ); (· · · , ζl, · · · , ζs + 2ηj)], 1 ≤ j ≤ k and
[h, 2m; (· · · , 2θi, · · · ); (· · · , 2ηj, · · · ); (· · · , −ζl, · · · , ζs + 2ζl)], 1 ≤ l ≤ s − 1

(R3)[h, 2m; (· · · ); (· · · ); (· · · , ζs−2, ζs−1, ζs)] (s ≥ 3) is equivalent with

[h + 1, 2m; (· · · ); (· · · ); (· · · , ζs−2 + ζs−1 + ζs)]
(R4)[h, 2m; (· · · ); (· · · ); (ζ1, ζ2)] is equivalent with

[h, 2m; (· · · ); (· · · ); (ζ1 + 2d, ζ2 − 2d)]

The main result of this section is:

Theorem 5.1. Two groups of data for the orientation reversing periodic maps
determine the same conjugate class if and only if they are equivalent under the
relations (R0)∼(R4).

The proof of the above theorem is lengthy, hence we decompose it into the

the following theorems 5.3, 5.6 and 5.12.

In this section we keep using the notations of section 4:
Let f be the orientation reversing periodic map on Σg which is a representa-

tive of the conjugate class determined by data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ1, · · · , ζs)].
Let ιl ⊂ Σg/f − Bf , l = 1, · · · , s be the corresponding co-oriented one-sided
loops and when we cut Σg/f along ⊔s

l=1ιl we get oriented surface Σ+

h,k+s.

Lemma 5.2. Two groups of data which are equivalent under (R0) and (R1)
determine the same conjugate class.

Proof. The order of branch points, boundary components and co-oriented one-
sided loops do not really matter. And when we reverse the orientations of each
ιl we get a new set of co-oriented one-sided loops which change the sign of ωf
value in the data.

In particular, when s = 0, we have:

g, if Σg/f and Σ′

Theorem 5.3. Given two orientation reversing periodic maps f on Σg and f ′
g/f ′ are both orientable, then f and f ′ are conjugate with
on Σ′
each other if and only if they have data which are equivalent under (R0) and
(R1).

When Σg/f is non-orientable, the choosing of one-sided loops is kind of
arbitrary. Therefore, the cases of s > 0 are a little complicated. In order to
prove that the later group of data in R(2), R(3) and R(4) determine the same
conjugate class as the former group of data, we need to prove that we can
choose the co-oriented one-sided loops on Σg/f − Bf diﬀerently to obtain the
later group of data.

Lemma 5.4. Two groups of data which are equivalent under the relation (R2)
determine the same conjugate class.

Proof. For boundary component Sqi of Σg/f − N (Bf ), let γ be the loop which
is parallel with Sqi and ωf (γ) = ωf (Sqi ) = 2θi. Join the point x = ιs(0) to a
point y ∈ γ(0) by a simple path α ⊂ Σg/f − N (Bf ) − ⊔s−1

l=1 ιl.

A small isotopy of the loop ιs · α · γ · ¯α supported on the tubular neigh-
borhood of α would give us a new simple one-sided loop ι′
It’s easy to
s.
see that {ι1, · · · , ιs−1, ι′
s} is co-oriented and induces the same orientations as
{ι1, · · · , ιs−1, ιs} does on all boundary components of Σg/f − N (Bf ) except for
Sqi . Hence ωf would change sign at Sqi and ωf (ι′
s) = ωf (ιs) + ωf (γ), which
gives us the later group of data in the ﬁrst case of (R2).

13

The second case of (R2) is quite the same as the ﬁrst case. The third case of
(R2) is similar, we only need to set γ to be the boundary of a tubular neighbor-
hood of ιl, 1 ≤ l ≤ s−1. Then we isotope ιs ·α·γ · ¯α in the tubular neighborhood
of α and get a new one-side simple loop ι′
s} would
be co-oriented. Since γ goes around ιl twice, we have ωf (ι′
s) = ωf (ιs) + 2ωf (ιl).
Then we have the later group of data in the third case of (R2).

g, if Σg/f and Σ′

Theorem 5.6. Given two orientation reversing periodic maps f on Σg and f ′
on Σ′
g/f ′ are both non-orientable and both have data with s = 1,
then f and f ′ are conjugate with each other if and only if the corresponding data
are equivalent under (R0) and (R2).

Proof. By lemma 5.2 and lemma 5.4, we know that two groups of data which
are equivalent under (R0) and (R2) determine the same conjugate class. Now
we suppose that f on Σg and f ′ on Σ′
g are conjugate with each other, which
g such that f ′ = h ◦
means there exists orientation preserving h : Σg → Σ′
f ◦ h−1. Then we have an induced homeomorphism ¯h : Σg/f → Σ′
g/f ′. And
for any qi ∈ Bf , we have h(qi) ∈ Bf ′ and ωf (Sqi ) = ±ωf ′(Sh(qi)), here the

14

sign is determined by the choice of co-oriented one-sided loops. Similarly,
we have ωf (Sδj ) = ±ωf ′(Sh(δj )) for δj ⊂ ∂(Σg/f ). Hence if f has data
[h, 2m; (· · · , 2θi, · · · ); (· · · , 2ηj, · · · ); (ζk+1)], then the data of f ′ is equivalent
to [h, 2m; (· · · , 2θi, · · · ); (· · · , 2ηj, · · · ); (ζ′
k+1)] under (R0) and (R2). Notice
that [h, 2m; (· · · , 2θi, · · · ); (· · · , 2ηj, · · · ); (ζk+1)] is also the data of f ′ based
on co-oriented one-sided loop {¯h(ι1)}. By lemma 5.5, we have ζ′
k+1 = ζk+1
mod n.

Lemma 5.7. Two groups of data which are equivalent under the relation (R3)
determine the same conjugate class.

Proof. In this case we have s ≥ 3 co-oriented one-sided loops. By the knowledge
of elementary topology, we can replace three of them by one one-sided loop and
one handle body.

After the operation above, the data [h, 2m; (· · · , 2θi, · · · ); (· · · , 2ηj, · · · ); (· · · , ζs−2, ζs−1, ζs)]

By relation (R2), these data determine the same conjugate class with [h +

Lemma 5.8. Suppose that {ι1, ι2} is a set of co-oriented loops. Then for any
simple loop γ ⊂ Σg/f −Bf −ι1−ι2 which does not separate ι1 and ι2, we can ﬁnd
a new simple one-sided loop ι′
1) = ωf (ι1) + ωf (γ).

1 ⊂ Σg/f − Bf such that ωf (ι′

Proof. Join the point ι1(0) to the point γ(0) by a simple path α ⊂ Σg/f − Bf −
ι1 − ι2. If ι1 · α · γ · ¯α is isotopy to a simple loop ι′
1 on Σg/f − N (Bf ), we have
ωf (ι′
1) = ωf (ι1) + ωf (γ). Otherwise, since γ does not separate ι1 and ι2, we
can join ι1(0) to γ(0) by simple path α ⊂ Σg/f − Bf which intersects ι2 exactly
once. Then ι1 · α · γ · ¯α is isotopy to a simple one-sided loop ι′
1 on Σg/f − Bf
and ωf (ι′

1) = ωf (ι1) + ωf (γ).

Lemma 5.9. Suppose that {ι1, ι2} is a set of co-oriented loops. We cut Σg/f
along ι1, ι2 and obtain Σ+
h,k+2. Then if h > 0, we can ﬁnd a simple loop γ on
Σg/f −Bf −ι1 −ι2, which satisﬁes: (1)γ does not separate ι1 and ι2; (2)ωf (γ) =
2. If h = 0, we can ﬁnd several disjointed simple loops γi, i = 1, 2, · · · , r on
Σg/f − Bf − ι1 − ι2, which satisﬁes: (1)⊔r
i=1Si does not separate ι1 and ι2;

i=1 ωf (γi) = 2 gcd{θ1, · · · , θb, η1, · · · , ηk}.

(2)Pr

Proof. Case 1: h > 0

We can ﬁnd a simple loop l on Σ+

π−1
¯f (ι2). Then we cut Σ+
the two new boundaries with induced orientation by l+, l−.

¯f (ι1),
h,k+2 along l and obtain a new surface Σh−1,k+4. Denote

h,k+2, such that l does not separate π−1

Because θ1 + · · · + θb + η1 + · · · + ηk + ζ1 + ζ2 = θ1 + · · · + θb + η1 + · · · + ηk +
ζ1 + ζ2 + 1 − 1, by theorem 3.3, there exists a periodic map ϕ on Στ −1,e+2 with
data [h − 1, m; (θ1, · · · , θb); (η1, · · · , ηk, ζ1, ζ2, 1, −1)]. And the branch covering
is πϕ : Στ −1,e+2 → Σh−1,k+4. Here ωϕ(l+) = 1

15

By lemma 2.5, the components number of π−1

ϕ (l−) are both one.
If we glue these two boundaries of Στ −1,e+2 properly we can obtain a new surface
Στ,e with an induced periodic map ϕ′ on it with data [h, m; (θ1, · · · , θb); (η1, · · · , ηk, ζ1, ζ2)].
And the branch covering is πϕ′ : Στ,e → Σh,k+2.

ϕ (l+) and π−1

By lemma 4.6, there is an orientation preserving homeomorphism h : Στ,e →
+ = h ◦ ϕ′ ◦ h−1. Then there is an induced homeomorphism
◦h = ¯h◦πϕ′. Hence γ = ¯h(l+) is the required
h,k+2 such that πf 2

Let gcd{θ1, · · · , θb, η1, · · · , ηk} = u1θ1 + · · · + ubθb + v1η1 + · · · + vkηk for
integers u1, · · · , ub, v1, · · · , vk. Then we can ﬁnd |ui| circles around qi for each
i = 1, 2, · · · , b with proper orientation and |vi| circles parallel with σj for each
j = 1, 2, · · · , k with proper orientation. It’s easy to see that they are the required
simple loops.

Lemma 5.10. Two groups of data which are equivalent under the relation (R4)
determine the same conjugate class.

Proof. Suppose that {ι1, ι2} is a set of co-oriented loops which gives us the
former group of data in (R4). We cut Σg/f along ι1, ι2 and obtain Σ+

h,k+2.

If h > 0 and d = 1, by lemma 5.8 and lemma 5.9, we can ﬁnd a new simple

one-sided loop ι′
non-orientable surface, we can always ﬁnd another simple one-sided loop ι′
that {ι′
later group of data in (R4) under relation (R2).

2} is co-oriented. And data based on {ι′

1, ι′

1, ι′

If h = 0 and d = gcd{θ1, · · · , θb, η1, · · · , ηk}, we only need to repeat the

above process ﬁnite times to get the new set of co-oriented one-sided loops.

Lemma 5.11. Suppose that {ι1, ι2} is a set of co-oriented loops. Then for an
arbitrary one-sided loop ι ⊂ Σg/f − Bf , we always have ωf (ι) = ±ωf (ι1) + 2rd
or ωf (ι) = ±ωf (ι2) + 2rd for some integer r.

Proof. We can suppose that Σg/f is triangulated with ι1 and ι2 to be sub-
complexes. Make a small isotopy, such that ι is properly embedded. Then we
can give each 2-simplex an orientation such that they are compatible everywhere
except along ι1 and ι2. Since each time ι passes through ι1 or ι2 the orientation
of nearby 2-simplexes would change once and ι has non-orientable neighborhood,
we know that ι passes through ι1 ⊔ι2 odd times. In other words, ι1 and ι2 divide
ι into odd pathes.

Then one of these pathes, denoted by α1, must have end points both in,
say ι1. Suppose that the end points of α1 divide ι1 into two pathes β1 and β2,
with β1(0) = ¯β2(0) = α1(1). And suppose that ι = α1 · α2. Then an isotopy
of α1 · β1 supported on the tubular neighborhood of ι1 would give us a loop
γ which is disjoint with ι1 ⊔ ι2. And an isotopy of α2 · β2 supported on the
tubular neighborhood of ι1 would give us a new one-sided loop ι′ which has
fewer intersections with ι1 ⊔ ι2. If γ separate ι1 and ι2, the isotopy of α1 · ¯β2

16

Now we have ωf (ι) = ωf (ι′) + ωf (γ). Since γ is a loop on Σ+

would give us a new loop which does not separate ι1 and ι2. We name this new
loop by γ, then the isotopy of α2 · ¯β1 would give us the new one-sided loop ι′.
h,k+2, ωf (γ) =
2ωf 2(γ) is even in Zn. If h = 0, since γ does not separate ι1 and ι2, γ and some
other boundary loops of Σg/f − N (Bf ) would bound a punctured sphere. Then
ωf (γ) is the sum of the value of ωf at these boundary loops of Σg/f − N (Bf ).
Hence we always have 2d|ωf (γ).

Repeat this process ﬁnite times, we would obtain a one-sided loop ι′′ which
intersects with ι1 ⊔ ι2 once. Suppose ι′′ intersects with ι1 once and the intersec-
tion is ι′′(0) = ι1(0). Then an isotopy of ι′′ · ι1 supported on the neighborhood
of ι1 would give us a loop γ which is disjoint with ι1 ⊔ ι2. If this loop separate ι1
and ι2, we let γ be the isotopy of ι′′ · ¯ι1. Hence we have ωf (ι′′) = ±ωf (ι1)+ωf (γ)
and 2d|ωf (γ).

g, if Σg/f and Σ′

Theorem 5.12. Given two orientation reversing periodic maps f on Σg and f ′
g/f ′ are both non-orientable and both have data with s = 2,
on Σ′
then f and f ′ are conjugate with each other if and only if the corresponding data
are equivalent under (R0), (R2) and (R4).

Now we ﬁnish this section by some considerations about the relation between

conjugacy and local conjugacy.

Lemma 5.13. The following numbers or facts are determined by local conju-
gacy:

1. Number n, b and k

2. χ(Σg/f )

3. Σg/f is orientable or not

4. The genus of Σg/f − N (Bf )

5. Number d in relation (R4).

Proof. The orbit length of x ∈ N (Wf ) − Wf equals the period n. b and k are
determined by local conjugacy in an obvious way. Since χ(Σg − N (Wf )) is n
times χ(Σg/f − N (Bf )), then χ(Σg/f − N (Bf )) + b = χ(Σg/f ).

Σg/f is orientable iﬀ. Wf separates Σg, which is determined by local con-

jugacy.

The genus of Σg/f equals h when s = 0 and equals 2h + s when s 6= 0.

Hence it can be derived from 2 − 2h − k − s = χ(Σg/f ).

In particular if f has data with s = 2, then h in this data is also determined.
If h = 0, d = 1. Otherwise, since the value of |ωf | at boundary loops of Σg/f −
N (Bf ) is determined by local conjugacy, then d = gcd{θ1, · · · , θb, η1, · · · , ηk} is
determined.

Corollary 5.14. If f and f ′ are locally conjugate, then Σg/f is homeomorphic
to Σ′

g/f ′ and

17

1. If Σg/f is orientable, then f must be conjugate with f ′

2. If Σg/f is non-orientable with genus number odd, then

(a) If m is odd, f must be conjugate with f ′
(b) If m is even, f must be conjugate with with f ′ or f ′m+1

3. If Σg/f is non-orientable with genus number even, then f may belongs to

at most gcd{d,m}+1

2

diﬀerent conjugate classes.

Proof. The ﬁrst case is immediate from theorem 5.3.

If s = 1 and f has data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ)]. Since f ′

and f are locally conjugate, by (R2), f ′ has data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ′)].
By theorem 4.9, ζ′ = ζ mod m, hence ζ′ = ζ or ζ′ = ζ + m. When m is even,
f m+1 has data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ + m)]; when m is odd,
ζ + m is even, by theorem 4.9, [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ + m)] will
not correspond to any periodic map. Then (2) is immediate.

If s = 2 and f has data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ1, ζ2)]. Since

f ′ and f are locally conjugate, by (R2), f ′ has data [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (ζ′
By theorem 4.9, ζ1 + ζ2 = ζ′
conjugate if (ζ′

6 The orientation reversing periodic maps with

large period

As an application of our theory, we study the orientation reversing periodic
maps with period n > 2(g − 1). In particular we will give a list of all possible
conjugate classes of those with period n ≥ 3g.

Lemma 6.1. If the pre-data of f is the data of ϕr, where ϕ is an orientation
preserving periodic map of period m and r is an integer satisfying ur − vm = 1.
Then

1. If u is odd, f is the power of f u, whose pre-data is the data of ϕ

2. If u is even, f is the power of f u+m, whose pre-data is the data of ϕ.

Proof. By the deﬁnition of pre-data, f 2
ur − vm = 1, (f 2

+ on Σ+
+)u is conjugate with (ϕr)u = ϕ.

τ,e is conjugate with ϕr. Since

If u is odd, f u is an orientation reversing periodic map whose pre-data is
the data of ϕ. From ur − vm = 1 and u is odd, we know that gcd{u, n} = 1.
Thus f is a power of f u.

If u is even, from ur − vm = 1 we know that m is odd. Then u + m is
odd and f u+m is an orientation reversing periodic map whose pre-data is the
data of ϕ. From (u + m)r − (v + r)m = 1 and u + m is odd, we know that
gcd{u + m, n} = 1. Thus f is a power of f u+m.

Lemma 6.2. Given data [h, m; (θ1, · · · , θb); (η1, · · · , ηc)] of an orientation pre-
serving periodic map on compact oriented surface. It is the pre-data of some
orientation reversing periodic map on a closed surface if and only if:

1. c > 0

2. tj = gcd{ηj, m} is odd, j = 1, 2, · · · , c

Proof. Suppose that the above conditions are true.

If m is even, we set k = 0 and s = c. Since tj = gcd{ηj, m} is odd, we
know that ηj is odd. Now we set ζl = ηl, l = 1, · · · , s. By theorem 4.9,
[h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (−−); (ζ1, · · · , ζs)] is the data for some orientation revers-
ing periodic maps.

If m is odd, we set k = c and s = 0. Then by theorem 4.9, [h, 2m; (2θ1, · · · , 2θb); (2η1, · · · , 2ηk); (−−)]

is the data for some orientation reversing periodic maps.

The necessity follows from lemma 4.3.

Given a group of pre-data, it’s easy to list all possible associated data of
some orientation reversing maps. For simplicity, in the following discussion we
only use pre-data.

Lemma 6.3. If n > 2(g − 1) and yj = 1, for some j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , c}, then f
must be conjugate with the power of a map of the following types:

1.
2.

g = m − 1, m is odd,
g = m − 2, m is odd,

pre-data [0, m; (m − 1, 1); (m)]
pre-data [0, m; (m − 1); (1, m)]

Proof. Since yj = 1 for some j, we know that gcd{ηj, m} = m for some j. Then
by theorem 4.9, m should be an odd integer.

From n > 2(g − 1) and formula (3) we have

m > g − 1 = 2τ − 2 + Σc

j=1 gcd{ηj, m} ≥ 2τ − 2 + m + (c − 1)

Hence 2 > 2τ + (c − 1), which implies that τ = 0, c = 1, 2.

If τ = 0, c = 1, we have g − 1 = −2 + m. It’s easy to see that f 2

+ : Σ0,m →
Σ0,m is a rotation on the punctured 2-sphere with two ﬁxed point. Then f 2
+ is
the is the power of a map with data [0, m; (m − 1, 1); (m)]. By lemma 6.1, f is
the power of a map with pre-data [0, m; (m − 1, 1); (m)].

If τ = 0, c = 2, we have m > g−1 = −2+m+gcd{η2, m}. Thus gcd{η2, m} =

1. Similarly, f is the power of a map with pre-data [0, m; (m − 1); (1, m)].

Lemma 6.4. If n > 2(g−1), we must have h = 0 and the following possibilities:

1.
2.

c = 2, b = 0, 1
c = 1, b = 1, 2, 3

Proof. First of all we would show that b + c ≥ 2: Assume that b + c < 2, by
c > 0 we have b = 0, c = 1. From theorem 4.9 we have m|η1 and y1 = 1. By
lemma 6.3, we know that b + c = 3, which contradicts with the assumption.

Then by n > 2(g − 1) and formula (2), we have 1 > g−1

m = 2h − 2 + c +

Since k + s = c, we easily have:

Theorem 6.5. If f is an orientation reversing periodic map of period n on
closed surface Σg and n > 2(g − 1), then Σg/f is homeomorphic to Σ0,2, N1,1,
N2,0, Σ0,1 or N1,0.

Lemma 6.6. If h = 0, b + c = 2 and yj > 1 for each j = 1, 2, · · · , c, then f is
conjugate with the power of some map with the following pre-data:

1.
2.

g = 0, pre-data [0, m; (m − 1); (1)]
g = 1, pre-data [0, m; (−−); (m − 1, 1)]

Proof. By the formula (1) we have 2τ −2 = −Σb

j=1 gcd{m, ηj}.
Then we obtain τ = 0 and each term of the right side of this equation has

i=1 gcd{m, θi}−Σc

value 1, which implies that

b = 1, c = 1
b = 0, c = 2

f 2
+ : Σ0,1 → Σ0,1 is conjugate with a rotation on a disc
f 2
+ : Σ0,2 → Σ0,2 is conjugate with a rotation on a annulus.

The rest of the proof is trivial.

Lemma 6.7. If n > 2(g − 1), b + c = 4 and yj > 1 for each j = 1, 2, · · · , c,
then f is conjugate with the power of some map with the following pre-data:

1. n = 2g, pre-data [0, 2k; (k, k, 2k − 1); (1)]
2. n = 2g, pre-data [0, 6; (3, 4, 4); (1)]

know that g −1 is odd. From x3 −1|g −1, we know that x3 = 2k for some integer
k ≥ 1. By corollary 3.4, m = 2k. Since m
is odd and lcm{x1, x2, y1} = m, we

Now we introduce a result of Hirose [7]. (In his article, the condition for the
following lemma is τ ≥ 3 and m ≥ 3τ , but it’s well-know that results for the
situation τ < 3 are also contained in his conclusion as long as h = 0 and the
branch points number is 3. In fact the proof in his article also applied for this
general case.)

Lemma 6.8. If m ≥ 3τ , h = 0 and the branch points number is 3, then the
genus τ , the period m and the multiplicity Q = (q1, q2, q3) of the branch points
of periodic map ϕ : Στ → Σh with q1 ≤ q2 ≤ q3 should be one of the following.
And for each case, ϕ must be conjugate with the power of periodic map with

Now under the condition n > 2(g − 1), the only unclear cases are:

1. h = 0, b = 1, c = 2, xi > 1 for i = 1, · · · , b, yj > 1 for j = 1, · · · , c and

n < 3g

2. h = 0, b = 2, c = 1, xi > 1 for i = 1, · · · , b, yj > 1 for j = 1, · · · , c and

n < 3g.

Corollary 6.10. If g > 3 is odd, all the possible orientation reversing periodic
maps with period larger than or equal to 3g must have period 4g − 4 and be
conjugate with the power of some orientation reversing periodic map with data
[0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (2k − 1, 1)].

Proof. It’s easy to see that the only possible case is in theorem 6.9: g = 2k + 1,
n = 4g − 4, b = 1, c = 2, pre-data [0, 4k; (2k); (2k − 1, 1)].
The possible data corresponding to this pre-data are:

D1 = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (2k − 1, 1)], D2 = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (2k − 1, 4k + 1)],
D3 = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (6k − 1, 1)], D4 = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (6k − 1, 4k + 1)].

23

By the equivalent relations listed in section 5, we have:

D1 = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (2k − 1, 1)] ∼R(1) [0, 8k; (−4k); (−−); (−2k + 1, −1)]
∼R(2) [0, 8k; (−4k); (−−); (−2k−1, 1)] = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (6k−1, 1)] = D3 and
D2 = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (2k−1, 4k+1)] ∼R(1) [0, 8k; (−4k); (−−); (−2k+1, −4k−
1)]
∼R(2) [0, 8k; (−4k); (−−); (−10k − 1, 4k + 1)] = [0, 8k; (4k); (−−); (6k − 1, 4k +
1)] = D4.

It’s easy to verify that if the map corresponding to D1 is f , then f 4k+1 is

exactly corresponding to D4.
