Fractional perimeter from a fractal perspective

Luca Lombardini

Universit`a degli Studi di Milano

Via Cesare Saldini, 50
20133, Milano, Italia

Following [15], we exploit the fractional perimeter of a set to give a

deﬁnition of fractal dimension for its measure theoretic boundary.

Abstract

We calculate the fractal dimension of sets which can be deﬁned in a
recursive way and we give some examples of this kind of sets, explaining
how to construct them starting from well known self-similar fractals.
In particular, we show that in the case of the von Koch snowﬂake S ⊂ R2
this fractal dimension coincides with the Minkowski dimension, namely

Ps(S) < ∞

⇐⇒

s ∈(cid:16)

0, 2 − log 4
log 3

(cid:17)

.

We also study the asymptotics as s → 1− of the fractional perimeter

of a set having ﬁnite (classical) perimeter.

Introduction and main results

It is well known (see e.g.
ﬁnite s-fractional perimeter for every s ∈ (0, 1).

[2] and [6]) that sets with a regular boundary have

In this paper we show that also sets with an irregular, “fractal”, boundary

can have ﬁnite s-perimeter for every s below some threshold σ < 1.
Actually, the s-perimeter can be used to deﬁne a “fractal dimension” for the
measure theoretic boundary

∂−E := {x ∈ Rn | 0 < |E ∩ Br(x)| < ωnrn for every r > 0},

of a set E ⊂ Rn. Indeed, in [15] the author suggested using the index s of the
seminorm [χE]W s,1 as a way to measure the codimension of ∂−E and he proved
that the fractal dimension obtained in this way is less or equal than the (upper)
Minkowski dimension.

We give an example of a set, the von Koch snowﬂake, for which these two

dimensions coincide.

Moreover, exploiting the roto-translation invariance and the scaling property
of the s-perimeter, we calculate the dimension of sets which can be deﬁned in a
recursive way similar to that of the von Koch snowﬂake.

On the other hand, as remarked above, sets with a regular boundary have
ﬁnite s-perimeter for every s and actually their s-perimeter converges, as s tends
to 1, to the classical perimeter, both in the classical sense (see [6]) and in the
Γ-convergence sense (see [2]).
As a simple byproduct of the computations developed in this paper, we exploit
Theorem 1 of [7] to prove this asymptotic property for a set E having ﬁnite
classical perimeter in a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary.
This last result is probably well known to the expert, though not explicitly
stated in the literature (as far as we know).
In particular, we remark that this lowers the regularity requested in [6], where
the authors asked the boundary ∂E to be C 1,α.

We begin by recalling the deﬁnition of s-perimeter.

Let s ∈ (0, 1) and let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open set. The s-fractional perimeter of

a set E ⊂ Rn in Ω is deﬁned as

Ps(E, Ω) := Ls(E ∩ Ω,CE ∩ Ω) + Ls(E ∩ Ω,CE \ Ω) + Ls(E \ Ω,CE ∩ Ω),

for every couple of disjoint sets A, B ⊂ Rn. We simply write Ps(E) for
Ps(E, Rn).
We can also write the fractional perimeter as the sum

Ps(E, Ω) = P L

s (E, Ω) + P N L

s

(E, Ω),

where

s (E, Ω) := Ls(E ∩ Ω,CE ∩ Ω) =

s (E, Ω) as the local part of the fractional perimeter, in the

s (F, Ω) = P L

s (E, Ω).

We say that a set E has locally ﬁnite s-perimeter if it has ﬁnite s-perimeter

We can think of P L
sense that if |(E∆F ) ∩ Ω| = 0, then P L
in every bounded open set Ω ⊂ Rn.

Now we give precise statements of the results obtained, starting with the

fractional analysis of fractal dimensions.

1.1 Fractal boundaries

First of all, we prove in Section 3.1 that in some sense the measure theoretic
boundary ∂−E is the “right deﬁnition” of boundary for working with the s-
perimeter.

To be more precise, we show that
∂−E = {x ∈ Rn | P L

s (E, Br(x)) > 0, ∀ r > 0},

and that if Ω is a connected open set, then

s (E, Ω) > 0 ⇐⇒ ∂−E ∩ Ω (cid:54)= ∅.
P L

This can be thought of as an analogue in the fractional framework of the fact
that for a Caccioppoli set E we have ∂−E = supp |DχE|.

Now the idea of the deﬁnition of the fractal dimension consists in using the

index s of P L

s (E, Ω) to measure the codimension of ∂−E ∩ Ω,
DimF (∂−E, Ω) := n − sup{s ∈ (0, 1)| P L

s (E, Ω) < ∞}.

As shown in [15] (Proposition 11 and Proposition 13), the fractal dimension

DimF deﬁned in this way is related to the (upper) Minkowski dimension by

DimF (∂−E, Ω) ≤ DimM(∂−E, Ω),

(1.1)

3

(for the convenience of the reader we provide a proof in Proposition 3.4).
If Ω is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary, this means that

for every s ∈(cid:0)0, n − DimM(∂−E, Ω)(cid:1),

Ps(E, Ω) < ∞

(1.2)

since the nonlocal part of the s-perimeter of any set E ⊂ Rn is

P N L

s

(E, Ω) ≤ 2Ps(Ω) < ∞,

for every s ∈ (0, 1).

We show that for the von Koch snowﬂake (1.1) is actually an equality.

Figure 1: The ﬁrst three steps of the construction of the von Koch snowﬂake

Namely, we prove the following

Theorem 1.1 (Fractal dimension of the von Koch snowﬂake). Let S ⊂ R2 be
the von Koch snowﬂake. Then

and

Therefore

DimF (∂S) = DimM(∂S) =

log 4
log 3

.

Actually, exploiting the self-similarity of the von Koch curve, we have

DimF (∂S, Ω) =

log 4
log 3

,

for every Ω s.t. ∂S ∩ Ω (cid:54)= ∅. In particular, this is true for every Ω = Br(p) with
p ∈ S and r > 0 as small as we want.

We remark that this represents a deep diﬀerence between the classical and

the fractional perimeter.
Indeed, if a set E has (locally) ﬁnite perimeter, then by De Giorgi’s structure
Theorem we know that its reduced boundary ∂∗E is locally (n − 1)-rectiﬁable.
Moreover ∂∗E = ∂−E, so the reduced boundary is, in some sense, a “big”
portion of the measure theoretic boundary.

On the other hand, there are (open) sets, like the von Koch snowﬂake, which
have a “nowhere rectiﬁable” boundary (meaning that ∂−E∩Br(p) is not (n−1)-
rectiﬁable for every p ∈ ∂−E and r > 0) and still have ﬁnite s-perimeter for
every s ∈ (0, σ0).

Moreover our argument for the von Koch snowﬂake is quite general and can
be adapted to calculate the dimension DimF of all sets which can be constructed
in a similar recursive way (see Section 3.4).
Roughly speaking, these sets are deﬁned by adding scaled copies of a ﬁxed
“building block” T0, that is

∞(cid:91)

abk−1(cid:91)

T :=

T i
k,

k=1

i=1

where T i
below for an example). We also assume that log b

k := F i

k(T0) is a roto-traslation of the scaled set λ−kT0 (see Figure 2

log λ ∈ (n − 1, n).

Theorem 3.8 shows that if such a set T satisﬁes an additional assumption,
k(S0) contained in CT ,

namely that “near” each set T i
then the fractal dimension of its measure theoretic boundary is

k we can ﬁnd a set Si

k = F i

DimF (∂−T ) =

log b
log λ

.

(1.5)

Many well known self-simlar fractals can be written either as (the boundary
of) a set T deﬁned as above, like the von Koch snowﬂake, or as the diﬀerence
E = T0 \ T , like the Sierpinski triangle and the Menger sponge.
However sets of this second kind are often s.t. |T ∆T0| = 0.

Since the s-perimeters of two sets which diﬀer only in a set of measure zero are
equal, in this case the s-perimeter can not detect the “fractal nature” of T .
Consider for example the Sierpinski triangle, which is deﬁned as E = T0 \ T

with T0 an equilateral triangle.
Then ∂−T = ∂T0 and Ps(T, Ω) = Ps(T0, Ω) < ∞ for every s ∈ (0, 1).

Roughly speaking, the reason of this situation is that the fractal object is
the topological boundary of T , while its measure theoretic boundary is regular
and has ﬁnite (classical) perimeter.

Still, we show how to modify such self-similar sets, without altering their
“structure”, to obtain new sets which satisfy the hypothesis of Theorem 3.8.
However, the measure theoretic boundary of such a new set will look quite
diﬀerent from the original fractal (topological) boundary and in general it will
be a mix of smooth parts and unrectiﬁable parts.

The most interesting examples of this kind of sets are probably represented
by bounded sets, like the one in Figure 2, because in this case the measure
theoretic boundary does indeed have, in some sense, a “fractal nature”.
Indeed, if T is bounded, then its boundary ∂−T is compact. Nevertheless, it
has inﬁnite (classical) perimeter and actually ∂−T has Minkowski dimension
strictly greater than n − 1, thanks to (1.1).

However, even unbounded sets can have an interesting behavior. Indeed we

obtain the following

5

Figure 2: Example of a “fractal” set constructed exploiting the structure of
the Sierpinski triangle (seen at the fourth iterative step), which satisﬁes the
hypothesis of Theorem 3.8

Proposition 1.2. Let n ≥ 2. For every σ ∈ (0, 1) there exists a Caccioppoli
set E ⊂ Rns.t.

Ps(E) < ∞

∀ s ∈ (0, σ) and Ps(E) = ∞

∀ s ∈ [σ, 1).

Roughly speaking, the interesting thing about this Proposition is the following.
Since E has locally ﬁnite perimeter, χE ∈ BVloc(Rn), it also has locally ﬁnite
s-perimeter for every s ∈ (0, 1), but the global perimeter Ps(E) is ﬁnite if and
only if s < σ < 1.

1.2 Asymptotics as s → 1−

We have shown that sets with an irregular, eventually fractal, boundary can
have ﬁnite s-perimeter.
On the other hand, if the set E is “regular”, then it has ﬁnite s-perimeter
for every s ∈ (0, 1).
Indeed, if Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary (or Ω = Rn),
then BV (Ω) (cid:44)→ W s,1(Ω). As a consequence of this embedding, we obtain

P (E, Ω) < ∞

=⇒

Ps(E, Ω) < ∞ for every s ∈ (0, 1).

(1.6)

Actually we can be more precise and obtain a sort of converse, using only

the local part of the s-perimeter and adding the condition

lim inf

s→1− (1 − s)P L

s (E, Ω) < ∞.

Indeed one has the following result, which is just a combination of Theorem

3’ of [4] and Theorem 1 of [7], restricted to characteristic functions,
Theorem 1.3. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary.
Then E ⊂ Rn has ﬁnite perimeter in Ω if and only if P L
s (E, Ω) < ∞ for every
s ∈ (0, 1), and

(1 − s)P L

s (E, Ω) < ∞.

In this case we have

(1 − s)P L

s (E, Ω) =

K1,nP (E, Ω).

(1.8)

We brieﬂy show how to get this result (and in particular why the constant looks
like that) from the two Theorems cited above.

We compute the constant K1,n in an elementary way, showing that

nωn

2

K1,n = ωn−1.

(1.9)

Moreover we show the following

Remark 1.4. Condition (1.7) is necessary. Indeed, there exist bounded sets
(see the following Example) having ﬁnite s-perimeter for every s ∈ (0, 1) which
do not have ﬁnite perimeter.

This also shows that in general the inclusion BV (Ω) ⊂(cid:84)
for every k ∈ N. Deﬁne E :=(cid:83)

s∈(0,1) W s,1(Ω) is strict.

Example 1.5. Let 0 < a < 1 and consider the open intervals Ik := (ak+1, ak)

that E has ﬁnite s-perimeter for every s ∈ (0, 1). We postpone the proof to
Appendix A.

k∈N I2k, which is a bounded (open) set.

The main result of Section 2 is the following Theorem, which extends the
asymptotic convergence of (1.8) to the whole s-perimeter, at least when the
boundary ∂E intersects the boundary of Ω “transversally”.
Theorem 1.6 (Asymptotics). Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set with Lipschitz
boundary. Suppose that E has ﬁnite perimeter in Ωβ, for some β ∈ (0, r0), with
r0 > 0 small enough. Then

(1.10)

In particular, if P (E, ∂Ω) = 0, then

(1 − s)Ps(E, Ω) = ωn−1P (E, Ω).

s→1

Moreover, there exists a set S ⊂ (−r0, β), at most countable, s.t.

s→1
for every δ ∈ (−r0, β) \ S.

(1 − s)Ps(E, Ωδ) = ωn−1P (E, Ωδ),

(1.11)

(1.12)

Roughly speaking, the second part of this Theorem says that even if we do
not have the asymptotic convergence of the s-perimeter in Ω, we can slighltly
enlarge or restrict Ω to obtain it. Actually, since S has null measure, we can
restrict or enlarge Ω as little as we want.

In [6] the authors obtained a similar result for Ω = BR a ball, but asking
C 1,α regularity of ∂E in BR. They proved the convergence in every ball Br
with r ∈ (0, R) \ S, with S at most countable, exploiting uniform estimates.
On the other hand, asking E to have ﬁnite perimeter in a neighborhood (as

7

small as we want) of the open set Ω is optimal.

In [2] the authors studied the asymptotics as s −→ 1− in the Γ-convergence
sense. In particular, for the proof of a Γ-limsup inequality, which is typically
constructive and by density, they show that if Π is a polyhedron, then

(1 − s)Ps(Π, Ω) ≤ Γ∗

nP (Π, Ω) + 2Γ∗

lim sup

s→1

n lim
ρ→0+

P (Π, Nρ(∂Ω)),

which is (1.10), once we sum the local part of the perimeter.

Their proof relies on the fact that Π is a polyhedron to obtain the convergence
of the local part of the perimeter, which is then used also in the estimate of the
nonlocal part. Moreover they need an approximation result to prove that the
constant is Γ∗

n = ωn−1.

They also prove, in particular

Γ − lim inf
s→1

(1 − s)P L

s (E, Ω) ≥ ωn−1P (E, Ω),

which is a stronger result than the ﬁrst part of Theorem 1.3.

1.3 Notation and assumptions

• All sets and functions considered are assumed to be Lebesgue measurable.
• We write A ⊂⊂ B to mean that the closure of A is compact and A ⊂ B.
• In Rn we will usually write |E| = Ln(E) for the n-dimensional Lebesgue

measure of a set E ⊂ Rn.

• We write Hd for the d-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure, for any d ≥ 0.
• We deﬁne the dimensional constants
π d

d ≥ 0.

Γ(cid:0) d

ωd :=

In particular, we remark that ωk = Lk(B1) is the volume of the k-
dimensional unit ball B1 ⊂ Rk and k ωk = Hk−1(Sk−1) is the surface
area of the (k − 1)-dimensional sphere

Sk−1 = ∂B1 = {x ∈ Rk ||x| = 1}.

• Since

|E∆F| = 0 =⇒ P (E, Ω) = P (F, Ω)

and Ps(E, Ω) = Ps(F, Ω),

in Section 2 we implicitly identify sets up to sets of negligible Lebesgue
measure.
Moreover, whenever needed we can choose a particular representative for
the class of χE in L1
We will not make this assumption in Section 3, since the Minkowski con-
tent can be aﬀected even by changes in sets of measure zero, that is, in
general

loc(Rn), as in the Remark below.

|Γ1∆Γ2| = 0

• We consider the open tubular ρ-neighborhood of ∂Ω,

Nρ(∂Ω) := {x ∈ Rn | d(x, ∂Ω) < ρ} = {| ¯dΩ| < ρ} = Ωρ \ Ω−ρ

(see Appendix B).

Remark 1.7. Let E ⊂ Rn. Up to modifying E on a set of measure zero, we
can assume (see Appendix C) that

E1 ⊂ E,

E ∩ E0 = ∅

and ∂E = ∂−E = {x ∈ Rn | 0 < |E ∩ Br(x)| < ωnrn, ∀ r > 0}.

(1.13)

2 Asymptotics as s → 1−
We say that an open set Ω ⊂ Rn is an extension domain if ∃C = C(n, s, Ω) > 0
s.t. for every u ∈ W s,1(Ω) there exists ˜u ∈ W s,1(Rn) with ˜u|Ω = u and

(cid:107)˜u(cid:107)W s,1(Rn) ≤ C(cid:107)u(cid:107)W s,1(Ω).

Every open set with bounded Lipschitz boundary is an extension domain (see
[8] for a proof). For simplicity we consider Rn itself as an extension domain.

We begin with the following embedding.

Proposition 2.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an extension domain. Then ∃C(n, s, Ω) ≥ 1
s.t. for every u : Ω −→ R

(cid:107)u(cid:107)W s,1(Ω) ≤ C(cid:107)u(cid:107)BV (Ω).

In particular we have the continuous embedding
BV (Ω) (cid:44)→ W s,1(Ω).

(2.1)

(2.2)

Proof. The claim is trivially satisﬁed if the right hand side of (2.1) is inﬁnite,
so let u ∈ BV (Ω). Let {uk} ⊂ C∞(Ω) ∩ BV (Ω) be an approximating sequence
as in Theorem 1.17 of [12], that is

(cid:90)

Ω

(cid:107)u − uk(cid:107)L1(Ω) −→ 0

and

lim
k→∞

|∇uk| dx = |Du|(Ω).

We only need to check that the W s,1-seminorm of u is bounded by its BV -norm.
Since Ω is an extension domain, we know (see Proposition 2.2 of [8]) that
∃C(n, s) ≥ 1 s.t.

(cid:107)v(cid:107)W s,1(Ω) ≤ C(cid:107)v(cid:107)W 1,1(Ω).

Then

[uk]W s,1(Ω) ≤ (cid:107)uk(cid:107)W s,1(Ω) ≤ C(cid:107)uk(cid:107)W 1,1(Ω) = C(cid:107)uk(cid:107)BV (Ω),

and hence, using Fatou’s Lemma,

[u]W s,1(Ω) ≤ lim inf

k→∞ [uk]W s,1(Ω) ≤ C lim inf

k→∞ (cid:107)uk(cid:107)BV (Ω) = C lim

k→∞(cid:107)uk(cid:107)BV (Ω)

= C(cid:107)u(cid:107)BV (Ω),

proving (2.1).

(iv) The nonlocal part of the s-perimeter is ﬁnite thanks to (iii). As for the

local part, remind that

2.2.2 Estimating the nonlocal part of the s-perimeter

We prove something slightly more general than (1.10). Namely, that to estimate
the nonlocal part of the s-perimeter we do not necessarily need to use the sets
Ωρ: any “regular” approximation of Ω would do.
Let Ak, Dk ⊂ Rn be two sequences of bounded open sets with Lipschitz
boundary strictly approximating Ω respectively from the inside and from the
outside, that is

(i) Ak ⊂ Ak+1 ⊂⊂ Ω and Ak (cid:37) Ω, i.e. (cid:83)
(ii) Ω ⊂⊂ Dk+1 ⊂ Dk and Dk (cid:38) Ω, i.e. (cid:84)

k Ak = Ω,
k Dk = Ω.

We deﬁne for every k

k := Dk \ Ω,

k := Ω \ Ak
Ω−

Tk := Ω+
dk := min{d(Ak, ∂Ω), d(Dk, ∂Ω)} > 0.

In particular we can consider Ωρ with ρ < 0 in place of Ak and with ρ > 0 in
place of Dk. Then Tk would be Nρ(∂Ω) and dk = ρ.
Proposition 2.5. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary
and let E ⊂ Rn be a set having ﬁnite perimeter in D1. Then

Since this holds true for any k, we get the claim.

2.2.3 Convergence in almost every Ωρ

Having a “continuous” approximating sequence (the Ωρ) rather than numerable
ones allows us to improve the previous result and obtain the second part of
Theorem 1.6.

We recall that De Giorgi’s structure Theorem for sets of ﬁnite perimeter (see

e.g. Theorem 15.9 of [13]) guarantees in particular that

|DχE| = Hn−1(cid:120)∂∗E

and hence

P (E, B) = Hn−1(∂∗E ∩ B)

for every Borel set B ⊂ Rn,

where ∂∗E is the reduced boundary of E.

Now suppose that E has ﬁnite perimeter in Ωβ. Then
P (E, ∂Ωδ) = Hn−1(∂∗E ∩ { ¯dΩ = δ}),

for every δ ∈ (−r0, β). Therefore, since

M := Hn−1(∂∗E ∩ (Ωβ \ Ω−r0 )) ≤ P (E, Ωβ) < ∞,

the set

S := {δ ∈ (−r0, β)| P (E, ∂Ωδ) > 0}

is at most countable.

Indeed, deﬁne

Since

the number of elements in each Sk is at most

As a consequence, S =(cid:83)

This concludes the proof of Theorem 1.6.

Irregularity of the boundary

3.1 The measure theoretic boundary as “support” of the

local part of the s-perimeter

First of all we show that the (local part of the) s-perimeter does indeed measure
a quantity related to the measure theoretic boundary.
Lemma 3.1. Let E ⊂ Rn be a set of locally ﬁnite s-perimeter. Then

∂−E = {x ∈ Rn | P L

(3.1)
Proof. The claim follows from the following observation. Let A, B ⊂ Rn s.t.
A ∩ B = ∅; then

s (E, Br(x)) > 0 for every r > 0}.

Ls(A, B) = 0 ⇐⇒ |A| = 0

|B| = 0.

or

Therefore

x ∈ ∂−E ⇐⇒ |E ∩ Br(x)| > 0 and |CE ∩ Br(x)| > 0 ∀ r > 0

⇐⇒ Ls(E ∩ Br(x),CE ∩ Br(x)) > 0 ∀ r > 0.

This characterization of ∂−E can be thought of as a fractional analogue of

(C.8). However we can not really think of ∂−E as the support of

s (E,−) : Ω (cid:55)−→ P L
P L

s (E, Ω),

in the sense that, in general

∂−E ∩ Ω = ∅

(cid:54)⇒ P L

s (E, Ω) = 0.

For example, consider E := {xn ≤ 0} ⊂ Rn and notice that ∂−E = {xn = 0}.
Let Ω := B1(2en) ∪ B1(−2en). Then ∂−E ∩ Ω = ∅, but

s (E, Ω) = Ls(B1(2en), B1(−2en)) > 0.
P L

On the other hand, the only obstacle is the non connectedness of the set Ω

and indeed we obtain the following
Proposition 3.2. Let E ⊂ Rn be a set of locally ﬁnite s-perimeter and let
Ω ⊂ Rn be an open set. Then

∂−E ∩ Ω (cid:54)= ∅ =⇒ P L

s (E, Ω) > 0.

Moreover, if Ω is connected

Therefore, if (cid:98)O(Rn) denotes the family of bounded and connected open sets, then

∂−E ∩ Ω = ∅ =⇒ P L

s (E, Ω) = 0.

∂−E is the “support” of

s (E,−) : (cid:98)O(Rn) −→ [0,∞)

P L

Ω (cid:55)−→ P L

s (E, Ω),

in the sense that, if Ω ∈ (cid:98)O(Rn), then

s (E, Ω) > 0 ⇐⇒ ∂−E ∩ Ω (cid:54)= ∅.
P L

15

Proof. Let x ∈ ∂−E ∩ Ω. Since Ω is open, we have Br(x) ⊂ Ω for some r > 0
and hence

s (E, Ω) ≥ P L
P L

s (E, Br(x)) > 0.

Let Ω be connected and suppose ∂−E ∩ Ω = ∅. We have the partition of Rn as
Rn = E0 ∪ ∂−E ∪ E1 (see Appendix C). Thus we can write Ω as the disjoint
union

Ω = (E0 ∩ Ω) ∪ (E1 ∩ Ω).

However, since Ω is connected and both E0 and E1 are open, we must have
E0 ∩ Ω = ∅ or E1 ∩ Ω = ∅. Now, if E0 ∩ Ω = ∅ (the other case is analogous),
then Ω ⊂ E1 and hence |CE ∩ Ω| = 0. Thus

s (E, Ω) = Ls(E ∩ Ω,CE ∩ Ω) = 0.
P L

3.2 A notion of fractal dimension
Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open set. Then
=⇒

t > s

W t,1(Ω) (cid:44)→ W s,1(Ω),

(see e.g. Proposition 2.1 of [8]). As a consequence, for every u : Ω −→ R there
exists a unique R(u) ∈ [0, 1] s.t.

that is

[u]W s,1(Ω)

(cid:26) < ∞, ∀ s ∈ (0, R(u))
R(u) = sup(cid:8)s ∈ (0, 1)(cid:12)(cid:12) [u]W s,1(Ω) < ∞(cid:9)
= inf(cid:8)s ∈ (0, 1)(cid:12)(cid:12) [u]W s,1(Ω) = ∞(cid:9) .

= ∞, ∀ s ∈ (R(u), 1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

In particular, exploiting this result for characteristic functions, in [15] the

author suggested the following deﬁnition of fractal dimension.
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open set and let E ⊂ Rn. If ∂−E ∩ Ω (cid:54)= ∅,
we deﬁne

DimF (∂−E, Ω) := n − R(χE),

the fractal dimension of ∂−E in Ω, relative to the fractional perimeter.
If Ω = Rn, we drop it in the formulas.

Notice that in the case of sets (3.2) becomes

R(χE) = sup(cid:8)s ∈ (0, 1)(cid:12)(cid:12) P L
= inf(cid:8)s ∈ (0, 1)(cid:12)(cid:12) P L

s (E, Ω) < ∞(cid:9)
s (E, Ω) = ∞(cid:9) .

In particular we can take Ω to be the whole of Rn, or a bounded open set

with Lipschitz boundary.
In the ﬁrst case the local part of the fractional perimeter coincides with the whole
fractional perimeter, while in the second case we know that we can bound the
nonlocal part with 2Ps(Ω) < ∞ for every s ∈ (0, 1). Therefore in both cases in

16

(3.4) we can as well take the whole fractional perimeter Ps(E, Ω) instead of just
the local part.

Now we give a proof of the relation (1.1) (obtained in [15]).

For simplicity, given Γ ⊂ Rn we set

ρ (Γ) := Nρ(Γ) ∩ Ω = {x ∈ Ω| d(x, Γ) ≤ ρ},
¯N Ω

(3.5)

for any ρ > 0.
Proposition 3.4. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set. Then for every E ⊂ Rn
s.t. ∂−E ∩ Ω (cid:54)= ∅ and DimM(∂−E, Ω) ≥ n − 1 we have
DimF (∂−E, Ω) ≤ DimM(∂−E, Ω).

(3.6)

Proof. By hypothesis we have

DimM(∂−E, Ω) = n − inf(cid:8)r ∈ (0, 1)|Mn−r

(∂−E, Ω) = ∞(cid:9),

and we need to show that

inf(cid:8)r ∈ (0, 1)|Mn−r

(∂−E, Ω) = ∞(cid:9) ≤ sup{s ∈ (0, 1)| P L

s (E, Ω) < ∞}.

Up to modifying E on a set of Lebesgue measure zero we can suppose that
∂E = ∂−E, as in Remark 1.7. Notice that this does not aﬀect the s-perimeter.

This implies

Thus for  > 0 very small, we have

inf(cid:8)r ∈ (0, 1)|Mn−r

(∂−E, Ω) = ∞(cid:9) −  ≤ sup{s ∈ (0, 1)| P L

s (E, Ω) < ∞}.

Letting  tend to zero, we conclude the proof.

In particular, if Ω has Lipschitz boundary we obtain

Corollary 3.5. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. Let
E ⊂ Rn s.t. ∂−E ∩ Ω (cid:54)= ∅ and DimM(∂−E, Ω) ∈ [n − 1, n). Then

for every s ∈(cid:0)0, n − DimM(∂−E, Ω)(cid:1) .

Ps(E, Ω) < ∞

(3.9)

Remark 3.6. Actually, previous Proposition and Corollary still work when
Ω = Rn, provided the set E we are considering is bounded.
Indeed, if E is bounded, we can apply previous results with Ω = BR s.t. E ⊂ Ω.
Moreover, since Ω has a regular boundary, as remarked above we can take
the whole s-perimeter in (3.4), instead of just the local part. But then, since
Ps(E, Ω) = Ps(E), we see that

DimF (∂−E, Ω) = DimF (∂−E, Rn).

3.2.1 The measure theoretic boundary of a set of locally ﬁnite s-

perimeter (in general) is not rectiﬁable

These results show that a set E can have ﬁnite fractional perimeter even if its
boundary is really irregular, unlike what happens with a Caccioppoli set and its
reduced boundary, which is locally (n − 1)-rectiﬁable.
Indeed, if Ω ⊂ Rn is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary and E ⊂ Rn
is s.t. ∅ (cid:54)= ∂−E ∩ Ω is not (n − 1)-rectiﬁable, with DimM(∂−E, Ω) ∈ (n − 1, n),
thanks to previous Corollary we have Ps(E, Ω) < ∞ for every s ∈ (0, σ).

18

We give some examples of this kind of sets in the following Sections.

In particular, the von Koch snowﬂake S ⊂ R2 has ﬁnite s-perimeter for every
s ∈ (0, σ), but ∂−S = ∂S is not locally (n − 1)-rectiﬁable.
Actually, because of the self-similarity of the von Koch curve, there is no part
of ∂S which is rectiﬁable (see below).

On the other hand, De Giorgi’s structure Theorem (see e.g. Theorem 15.9
and Corollary 16.1 of [13]) says that if a set E ⊂ Rn has locally ﬁnite perimeter,
then its reduced boundary ∂∗E is locally (n − 1)-rectiﬁable.
Moreover the reduced boundary is dense in the measure theoretic boundary,
which is the support of the Radon measure |DχE|,

∂∗E = ∂−E = supp |DχE|.

This underlines a deep diﬀerence between the classical perimeter and the

s-perimeter, which can indeed be thought of as a “fractional” perimeter.
Namely, having (locally) ﬁnite classical perimeter implies the regularity of an
“important” portion of the (measure theoretic) boundary. On the other hand,
a set can have a fractal, nowhere rectiﬁable boundary and still have (locally)
ﬁnite s-perimeter.

3.2.2 Remarks about the Minkowski content of ∂−E

In the beginning of the proof of Proposition 3.4 we chose a particular represen-
tative for the class of E in order to have ∂E = ∂−E. This can be done since it
does not aﬀect the s-perimeter and we are already considering the Minkowski
dimension of ∂−E.
|E∆F| = 0, we can use the

On the other hand, if we consider a set F s.t.

same proof to obtain the inequality

DimF (∂−E, Ω) ≤ DimM(∂F, Ω).

It is then natural to ask whether we can ﬁnd a “better” representative F , whose
(topological) boundary ∂F has Minkowski dimension strictly smaller than that
of ∂−E.

First of all, we remark that the Minkowski content can be inﬂuenced by
changes in sets of measure zero. Roughly speaking, this is because the Minkowski
content is not a purely measure theoretic notion, but rather a combination of
metric and measure.
For example, let Γ ⊂ Rn and deﬁne Γ(cid:48) := Γ ∪ Qn. Then |Γ∆Γ(cid:48)| = 0, but
Nδ(Γ(cid:48)) = Rn for every δ > 0.

In particular, considering diﬀerent representatives for E we will get diﬀerent

topological boundaries and hence diﬀerent Minkowski dimensions.

However, since the measure theoretic boundary minimizes the size of the

topological boundary, that is

∂−E =

(cid:92)

∂F,

|F ∆E|=0

(see Appendix C), it minimizes also the Minkowski dimension.

19

Indeed, for every F s.t. |F ∆E| = 0 we have

∂−E ⊂ ∂F =⇒ ¯N Ω
=⇒ Mr
=⇒ DimM(∂−E, Ω) ≤ DimM(∂F, Ω).

ρ (∂−E) ⊂ ¯N Ω
ρ (∂F )
(∂−E, Ω) ≤ Mr

3.3 Fractal dimension of the von Koch snowﬂake
The von Koch snowﬂake S ⊂ R2 is an example of bounded open set with
fractal boundary, for which the Minkowski dimension and the fractal dimension
introduced above coincide.
Moreover its boundary is “nowhere rectiﬁable”, in the sense that ∂S ∩ Br(p)
is not (n − 1)-rectiﬁable for any r > 0 and p ∈ ∂S.

First of all we construct the von Koch curve. Then the snowﬂake is made of

three von Koch curves.

Let Γ0 be a line segment of unit length. The set Γ1 consists of the four
segments obtained by removing the middle third of Γ0 and replacing it by the
other two sides of the equilateral triangle based on the removed segment.
We construct Γ2 by applying the same procedure to each of the segments in Γ1
and so on. Thus Γk comes from replacing the middle third of each straight line
segment of Γk−1 by the other two sides of an equilateral triangle.

As k tends to inﬁnity, the sequence of polygonal curves Γk approaches a

limiting curve Γ, called the von Koch curve.
If we start with an equilateral triangle with unit length side and perform the
same construction on all three sides, we obtain the von Koch snowﬂake Σ.
Let S be the bounded region enclosed by Σ, so that S is open and ∂S = Σ. We
still call S the von Koch snowﬂake.

Now we calculate the (Minkowski) dimension of Γ using the box-counting

The key observation is that Γ can be covered by three squares of length 1/3

dimensions (see Appendix D).
The idea is to exploit the self-similarity of Γ and consider covers made of squares
with side δk = 3−k.
(and cannot be covered by only two), so that N (Γ, 1/3) = 3.
Then consider Γ1. We can think of Γ as being made of four von Koch curves
starting from the set Γ1 and with initial segments of length 1/3 instead of 1.
Therefore we can cover each of these four pieces with three squares of side 1/9,
so that Γ can be covered with 3 · 4 squares of length 1/9 (and not one less) and
N (Γ, 1/9) = 4 · 3.
We can repeat the same argument starting from Γ2 to get N (Γ, 1/27) = 42·3,

and so on. In general we obtain

N (Γ, 3−k) = 4k−1 · 3.

Then, taking logarithms we get

Notice that the Minkowski dimensions of the snowﬂake and of the curve are

Now we explain how to construct S in a recursive way and we prove that

∂−S = ∂S = Σ.

As starting point for the snowﬂake take the equilateral triangle T of side 1,
with baricenter in the origin and a vertex on the y-axis, P = (0, t) with t > 0.
Then T1 is made of three triangles of side 1/3, T2 of 3 · 4 triangles of side 1/32

3.4 Self-similar fractal boundaries

The von Koch curve is a well known example of a family of rather “regular”
fractal sets, the self-similar fractal sets (see e.g. Section 9 of [11] for the proper
deﬁnition and the main properties).

Many examples of this kind of sets can be constucted in a recursive way
similar to that of the von Koch snowﬂake.
To be more precise, we start with a bounded open set T0 ⊂ Rn with ﬁnite
perimeter P (T0) < ∞, which is, roughly speaking, our basic “building block”.
Then we go on inductively by adding roto-translations of a scaling of the

building block T0, i.e. sets of the form

k(T0) := Ri

T i
k = F i

k,
k ∈ SO(n) and xi
where λ > 1, k ∈ N, 1 ≤ i ≤ abk−1, with a, b ∈ N, Ri

For example, the von-Koch snowﬂake is obtained by adding pieces.
the Sierpinski triangle E ⊂ R2 and Menger sponge E ⊂ R3.

Examples obtained by removing the T i

k’s are the middle Cantor set E ⊂ R,

We will consider just the set T and exploit the same argument used for the
von Koch snowﬂake to compute the fractal dimension related to the s-perimeter.
However, the Cantor set, the Sierpinski triangle and the Menger sponge are s.t.
|E| = 0, i.e. |T0∆T| = 0.
Therefore both the perimeter and the s-perimeter do not notice the fractal
nature of the (topological) boundary of T and indeed, since P (T ) = P (T0) < ∞,
we get Ps(T ) < ∞ for every s ∈ (0, 1). For example, in the case of the Sierpinski
triangle, T0 is an equilateral triangle and ∂−T = ∂T0, even if ∂T is a self-similar
fractal.

Roughly speaking, the problem in these cases is that there is not room

enough to ﬁnd a small ball Bi

Therefore, we will make the additional assumption that

∃ S0 ⊂ CT s.t. |S0| > 0

and Si

k := F i

k(S0) ⊂ CT ∀ k, i.

(3.14)

We remark that it is not necessary to ask that these sets do not overlap.

Below we give some examples on how to construct sets which satisfy this
additional hypothesis starting with sets which do not, like the Sierpinski triangle,
without altering their “structure”.

Now suppose that T does not satisfy (3.14). Then we can obtain a set T (cid:48)

which does, simply by removing a part S0 of the building block T0.

To be more precise, let S0 ⊂ T0 be s.t. |S0| > 0, |T0\S0| > 0 and P (T0\S0) < ∞.

Therefore, even if the Sierpinski triangle and the Menger sponge do not
However, we remark that the new boundary ∂−T (cid:48) will look very diﬀerent
from the original fractal. Actually, in general it will be a mix of unrectiﬁable
pieces and smooth pieces. In particular, we can not hope to get an analogue
of Corollary 3.7. Still, the following Remark shows that the new (measure
theoretic) boundary retains at least some of the “fractal nature” of the original
set.

Remark 3.10. If the set T of Theorem 3.8 is bounded, exploiting Proposition
3.4 and Remark 3.6 we obtain

DimM(∂−T ) ≥ log b
log λ

> n − 1.

Moreover, notice that if Ω is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary, then

P (E, Ω) < ∞ =⇒ DimF (E, Ω) = n − 1.

(3.16)

25

Therefore, if T ⊂⊂ BR, then

P (T ) = P (T, BR) = ∞,
even if T is bounded (and hence ∂−T is compact).

3.4.1 Sponge-like sets
The simplest way to construct the set T (cid:48) consists in simply removing a small
ball S0 := B ⊂⊂ T0 from T0.

In particular, suppose that |T0∆T| = 0, as with the Sierpinski triangle.

∞(cid:91)

|T0∆T| = 0 =⇒ |T (cid:48)∆(T0 \ S)| = 0.

(3.17)
Now the set E := T0 \ S looks like a sponge, in the sense that it is a bounded
open set with an inﬁnite number of holes (each one at a positive, but non-ﬁxed
distance from the others).
From (3.17) we get Ps(E) = Ps(T (cid:48)). Thus, since T (cid:48) satisﬁes the hypothesis

of previous Theorem, we obtain

DimF (∂−E) =

As an example we consider the Sierpinski triangle E ⊂ R2.
It is of the form E = T0 \ T , where the building block T0 is an equilateral

The pieces T i

Proposition 3.11. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open set.

Let E, F ⊂ Rn s.t. |E ∩ F| = 0. Then

(i) (Subadditivity)

Ps(E ∪ F, Ω) ≤ Ps(E, Ω) + Ps(F, Ω).

(3.19)

(ii) (Translation invariance)

Let E ⊂ Rn and x ∈ Rn. Then

(iii) (Rotation invariance)

Ps(E + x, Ω + x) = Ps(E, Ω).

(3.20)
Let E ⊂ Rn and R ∈ SO(n) a rotation. Then

Ps(RE,RΩ) = Ps(E, Ω).

(iv) (Scaling)

Let E ⊂ Rn and λ > 0. Then

Ps(λE, λΩ) = λn−sPs(E, Ω).

(3.21)

(3.22)

Proof. (i) follows from the following observations. Let A1, A2, B ⊂ Rn.
|A1 ∩ A2| = 0, then

If

Ls(A1 ∪ A2, B) = Ls(A1, B) + Ls(A2, B).

Moreover

and

A1 ⊂ A2 =⇒ Ls(A1, B) ≤ Ls(A2, B),

(3.23)

Ls(A, B) = Ls(B, A).

Therefore
Ps(E ∪ F, Ω) = Ls((E ∪ F ) ∩ Ω,C(E ∪ F )) + Ls((E ∪ F ) \ Ω,C(E ∪ F ) ∩ Ω)

= Ls(E ∩ Ω,C(E ∪ F )) + Ls(F ∩ Ω,C(E ∪ F ))

+ Ls(E \ Ω,C(E ∪ F ) ∩ Ω) + Ls(F \ Ω,C(E ∪ F ) ∩ Ω)

≤ Ls(E ∩ Ω,CE) + Ls(F ∩ Ω,CF )

+ Ls(E \ Ω,CE ∩ Ω) + Ls(F \ Ω,CF ∩ Ω)

= Ps(E, Ω) + Ps(F, Ω).

29

(ii), (iii) and (iv) follow simply by changing variables in Ls and the following

observations:

(x + A1) ∩ (x + A2) = x + A1 ∩ A2,
RA1 ∩ RA2 = R(A1 ∩ A2),
(λA1) ∩ (λA2) = λ(A1 ∩ A2),

R(CA) = C(RA),
λ(CA) = C(λA).

x + CA = C(x + A),

B Signed distance function
Given ∅ (cid:54)= E ⊂ Rn, the distance function from E is deﬁned as
for x ∈ Rn.

|x − y|,

dE(x) = d(x, E) := inf
y∈E

The signed distance function from ∂E, negative inside E, is then deﬁned as

¯dE(x) = ¯d(x, E) := d(x, E) − d(x,CE).

(B.1)

For the details of the main properties we refer e.g. to [1] and [3].

We also deﬁne the sets

Er := {x ∈ Rn | ¯dE(x) < r}.

Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. By deﬁnition
we can locally describe Ω near its boundary as the subgraph of appropriate
Lipschitz functions. To be more precise, we can ﬁnd a ﬁnite open covering
{Cρi}m
−→ R s.t.
Ω ∩ Cρi is the subgraph of ϕi. That is, up to rotations and translations,

i=1 of ∂Ω made of cylinders, and Lipschitz functions ϕi : B(cid:48)

ρi

Cρi = {(x(cid:48), xn) ∈ Rn ||x(cid:48)| < ρi, |xn| < ρi},

and

Ω ∩ Cρi = {(x(cid:48), xn) ∈ Rn | x(cid:48) ∈ B(cid:48)

, −ρi < xn < ϕi(x(cid:48))},

ρi

∂Ω ∩ Cρi = {(x(cid:48), ϕi(x(cid:48))) ∈ Rn | x(cid:48) ∈ B(cid:48)

}.

ρi

Theorem 4.1 of [10] guarantees that also the bounded open sets Ωr have

Let L be the sup of the Lipschitz constants of the functions ϕi.
Lipschitz boundary, when r is small enough, say |r| < r0.
Moreover these sets Ωr can locally be described, in the same cylinders Cρi used
for Ω, as subgraphs of Lipschitz functions ϕr
i which approximate ϕi (see [10] for
the precise statement) and whose Lipschitz constants are less or equal to L.
Notice that

∂Ωr = { ¯dΩ = r}.

Now, since in Cρi the set Ωr coincides with the subgraph of ϕr
i|2 dx(cid:48) ≤ Mi,

Hn−1(∂Ωr ∩ Cρi) =

1 + |∇ϕr

i , we have

Proposition B.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary.
Then there exists r0 > 0 s.t. Ωr is a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary
for every r ∈ (−r0, r0) and

Hn−1({ ¯dΩ = r}) < ∞.

|r|<r0

(B.2)

C Measure theoretic boundary

Since

|E∆F| = 0 =⇒ P (E, Ω) = P (F, Ω)

and Ps(E, Ω) = Ps(F, Ω),

(C.1)

we can modify a set making its topological boundary as big as we want, without
changing its (fractional) perimeter.
For example, let E ⊂ Rn be a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary. Then,
if we set F := E∪(Qn\E), we have |E∆F| = 0 and hence we get (C.1). However
∂F = Rn \ E.

For this reason one considers measure theoretic notions of interior, exterior
and boundary, which solely depend on the class of χE in L1
In some sense, by considering the measure theoretic boundary ∂−E deﬁned
below we can also minimize the size of the topological boundary (see (C.7)).
Moreover, this measure theoretic boundary is actually the topological boundary
of a set which is equivalent to E. Thus we obtain a “good” representative for
the class of E.

loc(Rn).

We refer to Section 3.2 of [15] (see also Proposition 3.1 of [12]). For some
details about the good representative of an s-minimal set, see the Appendix of
[9].
Deﬁnition C.1. Let E ⊂ Rn. For every t ∈ [0, 1] deﬁne the set

(cid:26)

x ∈ Rn(cid:12)(cid:12)∃ lim

r→0

E(t) :=

(cid:27)

|E ∩ Br(x)|

ωnrn

= t

,

(C.2)

of points density t of E. The sets E(0) and E(1) are respectively the measure
theoretic exterior and interior of the set E. The set
∂eE := Rn \ (E(0) ∪ E(1))

(C.3)

is the essential boundary of E.

Using the Lebesgue points Theorem for the characteristic function χE, we

see that the limit in (C.2) exists for a.e. x ∈ Rn and

|E ∩ Br(x)|

ωnrn

=

lim
r→0

a.e. x ∈ E,
0, a.e. x ∈ CE.

(cid:26) 1,

34

So

|E∆E(1)| = 0,

|CE∆E(0)| = 0

and |∂eE| = 0.

In particular every set E is equivalent to its measure theoretic interior.
However, notice that E(1) in general is not open.

We have another natural way to deﬁne a measure theoretic boundary.

Deﬁnition C.2. Let E ⊂ Rn and deﬁne the sets

E1 := {x ∈ Rn |∃r > 0, |E ∩ Br(x)| = ωnrn},
E0 := {x ∈ Rn |∃r > 0, |E ∩ Br(x)| = 0}.

Then we deﬁne

∂−E := Rn \ (E0 ∪ E1)

= {x ∈ Rn | 0 < |E ∩ Br(x)| < ωnrn for every r > 0}.

Notice that E0 and E1 are open sets and hence ∂−E is closed. Moreover,

E0 ⊂ E(0)

and

E1 ⊂ E(1),

(C.4)

∂eE ⊂ ∂−E.

since

we get

We have

F ⊂ Rn s.t. |E∆F| = 0 =⇒ ∂−E ⊂ ∂F.

(C.5)
Indeed, if |E∆F| = 0, then |F ∩ Br(x)| = |E ∩ Br(x)| for every r > 0. Thus for
any x ∈ ∂−E we have

0 < |F ∩ Br(x)| < ωnrn,

which implies

F ∩ Br(x) (cid:54)= ∅

and CF ∩ Br(x) (cid:54)= ∅

for every r > 0,

and hence x ∈ ∂F .

In particular, ∂−E ⊂ ∂E.
Moreover

∂−E = ∂E(1).

(C.6)
Indeed, since |E∆E(1)| = 0, we already know that ∂−E ⊂ ∂E(1). The converse
inclusion follows from (C.4) and the fact that both E0 and E1 are open.
From (C.5) and (C.6) we obtain

∂F,

(C.7)

(cid:92)

F∼E

∂−E =

where the intersection is taken over all sets F ⊂ Rn s.t. |E∆F| = 0, so we can
think of ∂−E as a way to minimize the size of the topological boundary of E.
In particular

F ⊂ Rn s.t. |E∆F| = 0 =⇒ ∂−F = ∂−E.

From (C.4) and (C.6) we see that we can take E(1) as “good” representative

for E, obtaining Remark 1.7.

35

Recall that the support of a Radon measure µ on Rn is deﬁned as the set

supp µ := {x ∈ Rn | µ(Br(x)) > 0 for every r > 0}.

Notice that, being the complementary of the union of all open sets of measure
zero, it is a closed set. In particular, if E is a Caccioppoli set, we have

supp |DχE| = {x ∈ Rn | P (E, Br(x)) > 0 for every r > 0},

(C.8)

and it is easy to verify that

∂−E = supp |DχE| = ∂∗E,

where ∂∗E denotes the reduced boundary. However notice that in general the
inclusions

∂∗E ⊂ ∂eE ⊂ ∂−E ⊂ ∂E

are all strict and in principle we could have

Hn−1(∂−E \ ∂∗E) > 0.

D Minkowski dimension
Deﬁnition D.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be an open set. For any Γ ⊂ Rn and r ∈ [0, n] we
deﬁne the inferior and superior r-dimensional Minkowski contents of Γ relative
to the set Ω as, respectively

Mr(Γ, Ω) := lim inf
ρ→0

ρ (Γ)|
| ¯N Ω
ρn−r

, Mr

(Γ, Ω) := lim sup

ρ→0

ρ (Γ)|
| ¯N Ω
ρn−r

.

Then we deﬁne the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions of Γ in Ω as

DimM(Γ, Ω) := inf(cid:8)r ∈ [0, n]|Mr(Γ, Ω) = 0(cid:9)
(Γ, Ω) = ∞(cid:9)
DimM(Γ, Ω) := sup(cid:8)r ∈ [0, n]|Mr

= n − sup(cid:8)r ∈ [0, n]|Mn−r(Γ, Ω) = 0(cid:9),
= n − inf(cid:8)r ∈ [0, n]|Mn−r
(Γ, Ω) = ∞(cid:9).

If they agree, we write

DimM(Γ, Ω)

for the common value and call it the Minkowski dimension of Γ in Ω.
If Ω = Rn or Γ ⊂⊂ Ω, we drop the Ω in the formulas.
Remark D.2. Let DimH denote the Hausdorﬀ dimension. In general one has

DimH(Γ) ≤ DimM(Γ) ≤ DimM(Γ),

and all the inequalities might be strict. However for some sets (e.g. self-similar
sets with some symmetric and regularity condition) they are all equal.

We also recall some equivalent deﬁnitions of the Minkowski dimensions, usually
referred to as box-counting dimensions, which are easier to compute. For the
details and the relation between the Minkowski and the Hausdorﬀ dimensions,
see [14] and [11] and the references cited therein.
For simplicity we only consider the case Γ bounded and Ω = Rn (or Γ ⊂⊂ Ω).

36

Deﬁnition D.3. Given a nonempty bounded set Γ ⊂ Rn, deﬁne for every δ > 0

(cid:110)
k ∈ N(cid:12)(cid:12) Γ ⊂ k(cid:91)

Bδ(xi), for some xi ∈ Rn(cid:111)

,

N (Γ, δ) := min

the smallest number of δ-balls needed to cover Γ, and

P(Γ, δ) := max(cid:8)k ∈ N|∃ disjoint balls Bδ(xi), i = 1, . . . , k with xi ∈ Γ(cid:9),

i=1

the greatest number of disjoint δ-balls with centres in Γ.

Then it is easy to verify that

N (Γ, 2δ) ≤ P(Γ, δ) ≤ N (Γ, δ/2).

(D.1)

Moreover, since any union of δ-balls with centers in Γ is contained in Nδ(Γ), and
any union of (2δ)-balls covers Nδ(Γ) if the union of the corresponding δ-balls
covers Γ, we get

P(Γ, δ)ωnδn ≤ |Nδ(Γ)| ≤ N (Γ, δ)ωn(2δ)n.

(D.2)

Using (D.1) and (D.2) we see that

(cid:110)
r ∈ [0, n](cid:12)(cid:12) lim inf
(cid:110)
r ∈ [0, n](cid:12)(cid:12) lim sup

δ→0

N (Γ, δ)δr = ∞(cid:111)

N (Γ, δ)δr = 0

δ→0

DimM(Γ) = inf

DimM(Γ) = sup

Then it can be proved that

DimM(Γ) = lim inf
δ→0

log N (Γ, δ)

− log δ
,
log N (Γ, δ)

− log δ

DimM(Γ) = lim sup

δ→0

.

(D.3)

Actually notice that, due to (D.1), we can take P(Γ, δ) in place of N (Γ, δ) in
the above formulas.
It is also easy to see that if in the deﬁnition of N (Γ, δ) we take cubes of side δ
instead of balls of radius δ, then we get exactly the same dimensions.
Moreover in (D.3) it is enough to consider limits as δ → 0 through any
decreasing sequence δk s.t. δk+1 ≥ cδk for some constant c ∈ (0, 1); in particular
for δk = ck. Indeed if δk+1 ≤ δ < δk, then
≤ log N (Γ, δk+1)
≤ log N (Γ, δk+1)

− log δk+1 + log(δk+1/δk)

log N (Γ, δk+1)

log N (Γ, δ)

so that

log N (Γ, δ)

δ→0

The opposite inequality is clear and in a similar way we can treat the lower
limits.
