The experimental observation of the renormalization of the Fermi velocity vF as a function of
doping has been a landmark for conﬁrming the importance of electronic interactions in graphene.
Although the experiments were performed in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld B, the
measurements are well described by a renormalization-group (RG) theory that did not include it.
Here we clarify this issue and show that for the weak magnetic ﬁelds at which the experiments are
performed, there is no change in the renormalization-group functions. Our calculations are carried
out in the framework of the Pseudo-quantum electrodynamics (PQED) formalism, which accounts
for dynamical interactions. We include only the linear dependence in B, and solve the problem
using two diﬀerent parametrizations, the Feynman and the Schwinger one. We conﬁrm the results
obtained earlier within the RG procedure and show that, within linear order in the magnetic ﬁeld,
the only contribution to the renormalization of the Fermi velocity arises due to interactions.

INTRODUCTION

The synthesis of graphene, a two-dimensional mate-
rial composed of carbon atoms organized in a honeycomb
lattice, had a huge impact in condensed-matter physics.
Due to the lattice geometry, this material has two in-
equivalent Dirac points (K and K ′), each one associated
to a valley degree of freedom.
In the vicinity of these
points, the free electrons exhibit a linear dispersion re-
lation, i.e., E ∝ vF|k|, where vF is the Fermi velocity,
which has a bare value three hundred times smaller than
the speed of light.

Even before the isolation and characterization of
graphene [1], ﬁeld-theoretical studies have predicted the
eﬀect of interactions in two-dimensional Dirac systems,
where the electrons and the photons can live in diﬀerent
dimensions [2, 3]. Indeed, in graphene and other 2D sys-
tems, such as silicene or phosphorene, e.g., the electrons
are constrained to move on a plane, while the mediators
of the interaction (photons) can propagate in a three-
dimensional space. Diﬀerent from usual quantum elec-
trodynamics (QED) in (2+1) dimensions, these kind of
eﬀective theories generate a Coulomb potential between
the electrons proportional to the inverse of the distance,
similar to QED in (3+1)D. An important question in the
description of the Dirac electrons in graphene is how the
Fermi velocity renormalizes due to interactions.

A renormalization-group study predicted logarithmic
corrections to the Fermi velocity as a function of dop-
ing (or energy) [3–7], which were later observed in many
experiments [8–10].
In addition, the renormalized vF
also depends strongly on the dielectric constant of the
medium surrounding the graphene sample.

The experimental conﬁrmation of this renormaliza-
tion called the attention to the role of interactions in
graphene. Moreover, since the Fermi velocity is the char-

acteristic velocity of the system, all the physical observ-
ables carry this information and this eﬀect is also seen
in indirect measurements, e.g., in the quantum capaci-
tance [20] and in the spin g-factor [12, 13]. A theoretical
description of the corrections to the g-factor due to inter-
actions can only account for the experimental data upon
insertion of the renormalized Fermi velocity and dielec-
tric constant as a function of doping [14].

Although theoretical studies have clariﬁed the role of
interactions in renormalizing the Fermi velocity, most of
the experiments verifying this behavior are performed
in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. The remaining
question, to be answered theoretically, is then whether
the renormalization-group functions are modiﬁed or not
due to a magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicularly to the
graphene plane.

A study of the Schwinger-Dyson equations in the static
limit in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld suggests a renor-
malization of the Fermi velocity in each of the Landau
levels due to electron-electron interactions [15]. On the
other hand, the experimental ﬁndings are well ﬁtted by a
renormalization-group description that ignores the mag-
netic ﬁeld. An important issue in this comparison is the
intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld. Although the calcula-
tions in Ref. [15] are made in the “weak” ﬁeld approxima-
tion [? ], they cannot describe the experiments detecting
the renormalization of the Fermi velocity [8–10] because
these experiments are not in the Landau-level, but in the
Shubnikov-de Haas regime.

Here, we investigate this problem within the Pseudo-
quantum electrodynamics (PQED), which accounts for
dynamical interactions, using a ﬁeld-theoretical method.
Since PQED is a renormalizable theory, i.e., the coupling
constant is dimensionless, we use perturbation theory up
to one-loop order to obtain the ﬁrst correction to the
fermionic propagator due to interactions, and under the

presence of a weak external magnetic ﬁeld. We show that
in the weak-ﬁeld approximation, we may separate the
electron self-energy in two pieces: one at zero magnetic
ﬁeld, and another with a linear dependence on the ﬁeld.
Focusing only on the B-ﬁeld term, through two diﬀerent
parametrizations, Feynman’s and Schwinger’s, we com-
pute the contribution due to the magnetic ﬁeld, which
happens to be ﬁnite. Within the renormalization group
equations, we show that the neither the weak magnetic
ﬁeld nor any ﬁnite contribution modify the renormaliza-
tion of the Fermi velocity.

The paper is divided as follow. In Sec. II, we intro-
duce the PQED model used in our calculations, and the
Feynman rules associated with it, in the presence of an
external magnetic ﬁeld B. In Sec. III, we compute the
electron self-energy in the weak-ﬁeld approximation, us-
ing two diﬀerent parametrizations. In Sec. IV, we outline
the renormalization-group equations for the model in or-
der to investigate the eﬀect of the weak magnetic ﬁeld
and we present the conclusions of our work in Sec. V.
The details of the calculations are given in the appen-
dices.

II. THE MODEL

The particular system of our interest is illustrated in
Fig. 1. There are electrons propagating with a Fermi ve-
locity vF in a two-dimensional space, under the inﬂuence
of an external magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicularly to
it. Moreover, the photons through which the electrons in-
teract are not conﬁned to the plane, and can propagate
in a three-dimensional space.

FIG. 1. Illustrative picture of the system studied.

Mathematically, the dimensional mismatch illustrated
above can be described by imposing a constraint in the
matter current, and the result is a projected theory called
Pseudo-QED [2]. This eﬀective theory works in (2+1)D,
and the term “pseudo” originates due to the pseudo-
diﬀerential operator that now appears in the Maxwell
Lagrangian (see Eq. (1)).

The Pseudo-QED Lagrangian, in the presence of an

external magnetic ﬁeld, is given by

where (cid:3) = c2∆−∂2/∂t2, γµ = (γ0, βγi), ¯∂µ = (∂0, vF ∂i),

Aµ = (A0, Ai), Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ and the dimension-
less parameter β = vF /c. Now, the minimal coupling is
µ and a classical A(e)
written as a sum of a quantum A(q)
µ
µ + A(e)
contributions, i.e., Aµ = A(q)
µ . The ﬁrst term is
the vector potential associated to the quantized dynami-
cal electromagnetic ﬁeld, which describes the interaction
between the photon and the fermion ﬁelds, whereas the
second is due to the external magnetic ﬁeld. In this work,
we adopt the Landau gauge A(e)
µ = (0, 0, Bx), with B de-
noting a constant magnetic ﬁeld that couples minimally
to the free-fermion momentum to generate the discrete
Landau levels.

The Schwinger’s proper-time representation of the
fermion propagator in (2+1)D in momentum space k is

ℓ = pc(|eB|)−1 (we assume  = 1). The γ1,2 and the

k1,2 are the spatial components of the γ-matrices and the
momentum, respectively. Here, we neglect ﬁnite-density
contributions because we are interested in the behavior
of the system near the Dirac points. Perturbative cal-
culations in QED taking into account these extra contri-
butions were performed in the Refs. [17, 18]. The poles
of the fermionic propagator yield the energy dispersion

relation p0 = ±En = ±p2|eB|n, where n is the quan-

tum number associated with the discrete Landau levels
[17]. The photon propagator in the Landau gauge and
the interaction vertex are deﬁned, respectively, as

III. ELECTRON SELF-ENERGY

The electron self-energy Σ, represented by the Feyn-
man diagram given in Fig. 2, carries the information
about the propagation of the electron under the eﬀect of
interactions. Therefore, to investigate the possible renor-
malization of the parameters contained in the Dirac La-
gragian, i.e., the Fermi velocity, the electron mass and
the fermionic ﬁeld itself, one needs to calculate Σ.

Until now, we considered the full Landau-levels con-
tribution to the one loop self-energy. Nonetheless, to
solve analytically the parametric integrals and proceed
with a more intuitive expression for the self-energy, it
is necessary to examine some approximations. The ﬁrst
useful one is to consider only terms up to linear order in
β = vF /c. Since linear terms in β are already of order
of 1/300, second- or higher-order terms would generate
negligible contributions that can be discarded. Hence,

which are up to linear order in the B-ﬁeld. In this case,

We observe in Eqs. (11) and (12) that the linear in B term
gives only an extra contribution to the p0 component
because I2 does not depend on B [see also Eq. (8)]. The
remaining integrals are just the eﬀect of interactions, as
we expect for zero magnetic ﬁeld. The same result can
be obtained if one starts with the fermionic propagator
already in the weak ﬁeld approximation [18], i.e.,

Therefore, within these approximations, the additional
contribution to the electron self-energy due to the mag-
netic ﬁeld can be computed separately. In other words,

Σ(¯p) = Σ(0)(¯p) + Σ(1)(¯p) + . . . ,

where Σ(0) is the self-energy in the absence of magnetic
ﬁeld, and the expansion follows with the dependence on
the B-ﬁeld, as for the propagator in Eq. (13).

Now, starting from the propagator in the weak-ﬁeld
approximation, and performing the integrals in two dif-
ferent parametrizations in order to double check our re-
sults, we ﬁnd (see Appendix A for details)

where Eqs. (14) and (15) are equivalent. Although the
results obtained for the two parametrizations may seem
diﬀerent at ﬁrst glance, below we plot both trigonometric
functions together to show their qualitative behavior, and
illustrate that the result is indeed independent of the
parametrization scheme in the regime of validity of the
theory.

In the y-axis in Fig. 3, we represent

y(x) = sin−1h(cid:0)x2 − 1(cid:1)−1/2i ,

with a black solid line, and

y(x) = coth−1(x),

with a red dashed line, for a given value of x = vF|p|/|p0|.
Both trigonometric functions are only valid for Re [|x|] ≥
1.
These results show that in linear order the magnetic
ﬁeld gives a ﬁnite contribution to the electron self-energy.
Although this result suggests that the magnetic ﬁeld will
not modify the ﬂow of the Fermi velocity, in the next
section we explicitly calculate the renormalization-group
equations to show that this is indeed the case.

IV. RENORMALIZATION-GROUP STUDY

In order to use the renormalization-group functions,
ﬁrst we need to deﬁne the expression for the inverse of
the free-fermion propagator in the presence of the mag-
netic ﬁeld. This turns out not to be a problem because
the information about the B-ﬁeld is contained within the
Schwinger’s phase factor [16] and the inverse of the prop-
agator happens to be the same as in the case of zero B-
ﬁeld [18, 19]. Based on this statement, we can start from
the propagator as in Eq. (2), without any approxima-
tions, and obtain an expression for the self-energy with
all the possible contributions coming from the magnetic
ﬁeld. Hence, the case of a weak magnetic ﬁeld would only
be considered in the approximation for the self-energy.

The renormalization-group equation is given by

(16)

where Γ(NF ,NA) represent the vertex functions, with NF
and NA the number of fermion and photon external lines,
respectively, in the Feynman diagrams. The functions
γψ and γA are the respective anomalous dimension of
the fermion and photon ﬁelds, and βi (i = e, vF , c) are
the beta-functions associated to the parameters of the
Pseudo-QED Lagrangian. We use dimensional regular-
ization to obtain the vertex functions in Eq. (16).

In the case of the fermion two-point function, we have

(18)

Γ(2,0) = −i(cid:0)γ0p0 + vF γipi(cid:1) − iΣ.

Here, we write the self-energy Σ in a general form, where
all the possible contributions of an external magnetic ﬁeld
could be included.

self-energy can then be written as

According to our approximation Σ ≈ Σ(0) + Σ(1), the
− iΣ = e2(cid:16)ﬁnite(2,0) + ln µRes(2,0)(cid:17) + e3f (B),

(19)

where we divide the zero magnetic ﬁeld part into a ﬁnite
and a divergent contribution, with

velocity changes with respect to the energy scale of the
theory.

5

Res(2,0) = A1γ0p0 + A2γipi,

(20)

representing the pole term proportional to 1/ǫ. For the
RG purposes, here, the explicit form of the ﬁnite(2,0) con-
tribution is irrelevant. The coeﬃcients A1 and A2 are
determined in Eqs. (8) for B = 0, and the function f (B)
is the ﬁnite result obtained in Eq. (14) or (15).

Now, expanding each one of the parameters in Eq. (17)

in terms of the coupling constant e, e.g.,

βvF = β(1)

vF e + β(2)

vF e2 + β(3)

vF e3 + . . . ,

ψ = β(1)

A = β(1)

going up to third order, and applying Eq. (17), we ﬁnd
that γ(1)
vF = 0. Moreover, performing the same
analysis for the other two vertex functions, Γ(2,1) and
Γ(0,2), we ﬁnd that γ(1)
e = 0 (for more
details of the calculations see Appendix C). In second
order in the coupling constant, for β(2)
vF , we obtain the
well-known renormalization of the Fermi velocity solely
due to interaction eﬀects [3]. This is expected because
the magnetic-ﬁeld term enters in Eq. (19) as e3, hence,
the only possible contribution should be seen in this order
of the coupling constant. At third order in e, we observe
that the corrections to β(3)
vF , depending on the ﬁnite part
of the self-energy, would appear for β(2)
6= 0. However,
e ∝ γ(1)
β(2)
A , and as the photon self-energy has no diver-
gences in one-loop order, using dimensional regulariza-
tion, its anomalous dimension is null (γ(1)
A = 0).
Thus, β(3)
vF = 0, and no additional renormalization term
is generated due to the presence of an external magnetic
ﬁeld. This is the main result of this paper.

A = γ(2)

c = β(1)

e

It has been observed in Ref. [20], through measure-
ments of quantum capacitance, that the Fermi velocity
displays the same indistinguishable logarithmic renor-
malized behavior as a function of doping both in the ab-
sence or in the presence of a weak magnetic ﬁeld. Our
results conﬁrm that, from a theoretical perspective, this
should be indeed the case.

A simple analysis of the perturbation theory shows
that our results hold also for high-order loops due to
the fact that the theory is renormalizable. Therefore,
in the weak-ﬁeld expansion, any contribution depending
on the magnetic ﬁeld B would generate additional ﬁnite
terms to the electron self-energy, which do not change
the renormalization-group functions.

Even though the weak magnetic ﬁeld has no eﬀect
in the renormalization-group functions, ﬁnite tempera-
tures could aﬀect this renormalization. In addition, for
stronger magnetic ﬁelds, it was shown theoretically using
the Schwinger-Dyson equations that within the static ap-
proximation the interactions renormalize the Fermi veloc-
ity with a factor that depends on the Landau-level index
[15]. The generalization of this theory to the dynamical
case and stronger magnetic ﬁelds, however, remains to
be done.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Motivated by the fact that most of the experiments of
the Fermi velocity renormalization in graphene are per-
formed in the presence of a weak external magnetic ﬁeld
[8–10], whereas the ﬁeld-theoretical models either ignore
the latter [3] or study the problem in the (strong ﬁeld)
Landau-level regime [15], we decided to revise the topic.
Our starting point is the Pseudo-QED formalism,
interactions, under the
which accounts for dynamical
presence of a weak perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld. The
magnetic ﬁeld contribution to the self-energy was ob-
tained using two diﬀerent but equivalent parametriza-
tion schemes. The analysis of the renormalization group
shows that a weak magnetic ﬁeld has no additional eﬀect
in the renormalization of the Fermi velocity, within linear
order in B. In this particular theory, because the photon
ﬁeld has null anomalous dimension, up to third-order in
the coupling constant e, no ﬁnite contributions coming
from the electron self-energy can modify this renormal-
ization. Hence, in this approximation, it is suﬃcient to
consider only the eﬀect of interactions to observe how the

The integrals over k are Gaussian, and to solve them
we ﬁrst introduce a regulator Λ2 to avoid high-energy

momentum contributions, e.g., exp(cid:0)−k2Λ−2(cid:1). Then, we

combine separately the terms proportional to k0 and k
to complete the square for each of them as in Eq. (7).

APPENDIX B: GAUSSIAN REGULATOR

In a scenario where the Lorentz symmetry is broken,
we show the relation between the Gaussian regulator and
the generated Gamma functions. The result is slightly
diﬀerent from the isotropic situation, as we discuss later.
Let us explore a simple, but useful and illustrative ex-
ample in d-spatial dimensions. We start with a common
integral over the momentum q,

where m is a mass term, and we added a Gaussian func-
tion for each integral over the q-components, with a cutoﬀ
Λ to suppress the large-momentum contribution. Here, v
is the characteristic velocity, d stands only for the spatial
dimensions, i.e., d = 1, 2 or 3, and we consider the regime
m2 ≪ Λ2. Now, introducing Schwinger’s parametriza-

and the B-ﬁeld term in the self-energy reads

where we used the properties of the γ-matrices, e.g.,

Now, to calculate the integrals over the loop mo-
mentum k in Eq. (22), we deﬁne which one of the
two parametrizations (Feynman’s or Schwinger’s) will be
used. Here, we use Schwinger’s parameterization as in
Eq. (6). Nevertheless, if one chooses to use Feynman’s
parameters, like

(26)

Since d is a positive and integer number associated to the
number of spatial dimensions, according to Eq. (26) the
poles of the Gamma function will appear for odd values
of d.

Now, in the isotropic case, following the same steps for

the function integrated in Eq. (24), we ﬁnd

Id′ (m2) =

(m2)−1+d′/2

(2π1/2)d′ Γ(cid:18)1 −

d′

2(cid:19) ,

(27)

where the poles of the Gamma function are slightly diﬀer-
ent. Since d′ ∈ N∗ (not including zero), the poles will be
encountered for even values of d′. However, the Gamma
functions in Eqs. (26) and (27) are essentially the same,
and they contain poles for even space-time dimensions
(or odd spatial dimensions, i.e., d′ = d + 1). The impor-
tant point to be made here is the presence of the (−1)d/2
factor in Eq. (26), because this gives the diﬀerence of i-
or sign-factors between the anisotropic and the isotropic
integrations.

APPENDIX C: RG CALCULATIONS

In this appendix, we show more details of the calcu-
lations concerning the renormalization-group equations.
As usual, the scaling parameter µ is introduced through
µǫ/2, where ǫ will be taken to zero in the end. Hence,
applying Eq. (18) in Eq. (17), with Σ given by Eq. (19),

˜f + ln µ∂vF

(28)

where ∂j is a partial derivative with respect of one of
the parameters j = c, vF , e. We expand each of the βj-
functions and γψ in terms of e up to third-order, e.g.,

βvF = β(1)

vF e + β(2)

vF e2 + β(3)

vF e3 + . . . ,

and we unite the elements that share the same depen-
dence on the coupling constant e.
In this manner, we
obtain three equations, one for each diﬀerent order in e.

a. Order of e
− iγlplβ(1)

vF + 2iγ(1)
ψ (γ0p0 + vF γlpl) = 0,

vF = 0.

∴

b. Order of e2
˜R − iγlplβ(2)

∴

vF + 2iγ(2)

ψ (γ0p0 + vF γlpl) = 0,

vF + 2ivF γ(2)

ψ i + γ0p0hA1 + 2iγ(2)

ψ i = 0,

and γ(2)

ψ =

A1.

β(2)
vF = −i (A2 − vF A1)

Here, we replaced ˜R as in Eq. (20), and we used that
β(1)
e = 0, which can be obtained by doing the same
procedure for the other two Γ-functions, i.e, Γ(0,2) and
Γ(2,1). Note that ˜R only contains the divergent part of
the electron self-energy. In other words, it is suﬃcient
to compute Σ(0) to ﬁnd β(2)
vF , which is precisely the func-
tion associated to the renormalization of the Fermi veloc-
ity. This is a second-order eﬀect in the coupling constant
e, and the magnetic ﬁeld neither adds an extra term,
nor changes this renormalization. Moreover, within the
renormalization-group scheme seen in Eq. (16), no ﬁnite
contributions are encountered in this renormalization.

c. Order of e3

where we used the results β(1)
ψ = 0. The mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬁnite contribution would only be possible if
β(1)
6= 0. However, as the polarization tensor is ﬁnite
e

j = γ(1)

in one-loop order, using dimensional regularization, its
anomalous dimension is null, γ(1)
A = 0, and this
implies that both β(1)
ψ = 0,
then β(3)
vF = 0. Therefore, neither the linear magnetic
ﬁeld nor the other ﬁnite contributions change the Fermi-
velocity renormalization.

A = γ(2)
are zero. Since γ(3)
