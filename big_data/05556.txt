SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND

SQUARE SEQUENCES

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

Abstract. We investigate the relationship between weak square prin-
ciples and simultaneous reﬂection of stationary sets.

1. Introduction

The investigation of the tension between compactness and incompactness
phenomena in set theory has been a fruitful line of research, touching on
aspects of large cardinals, inner model theory, combinatorial set theory, and
cardinal arithmetic. Prominent among incompactness principles in set theory
are square principles. Square principles were ﬁrst introduced by Jensen,
and variations have been deﬁned by a number of researchers since then. A
notable weakening, which we study here, is due to Todorcevic. On the other
hand, stationary reﬂection is an important compactness phenomenon.
It
was known early on that Jensen’s original square principle is incompatible
with stationary reﬂection. Subsequent work, particularly [1], indicates that
weakenings of Jensen’s square principle are compatible with some amount of
stationary reﬂection but preclude stronger forms of simultaneous stationary
reﬂection.
In this paper, we continue this vein of research by considering
the relationship between a hierarchy of weakenings of Todorcevic’s square
principle and simultaneous stationary reﬂection.

Our notation is for the most part standard. We use [6] as a standard
reference for undeﬁned terms. If A is a set of ordinals, then otp(A) denotes
the order type of A and acc(A) denotes the set of accumulation points of A
below the strong supremum of A, i.e. the set {β | β < sup({α + 1 | α ∈ A})
and β = sup(A ∩ β)}. If κ < λ are inﬁnite cardinals, with κ regular, then
κ = {α < λ | cf(α) = κ}. Sλ
Sλ
≥κ, and similar expressions are interpreted
in the obvious way.

<κ, Sλ

We start by recalling the deﬁnition of Jensen’s original square principle.

Deﬁnition 1.1. [7] Let κ be a cardinal. We say that hCα | α < κ+i is a (cid:3)κ
sequence if the following hold.

(1) For all α < κ+, Cα is a club in α.
(2) (Coherence) For all β < κ+ and all α ∈ acc(Cβ), Cβ ∩ α = Cα.

This research was undertaken while the second author was a Lady Davis Postdoctoral
Fellow. The author would like to thank the Lady Davis Fellowship Trust and the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem.

(3) For all α < κ+, otp(Cα) ≤ κ.

(cid:3)κ is the assertion that a (cid:3)κ sequence exists. We say that a sequence is
coherent if it satisﬁes (1) and (2). In this case we say that κ+ is the length
of the sequence.

Remark 1.2. For our purposes, we may assume that, for every α < κ+,
Cα+1 = {α}.

We can think of (cid:3)κ as a coherent way of witnessing the singularity of
every ordinal between κ and κ+. This coherence allows us to build various
objects by induction. It also witnesses the incompactness of κ+, since it is
impossible to extend the sequence to a coherent sequence of length κ+ + 1
without collapsing κ+. From (cid:3)κ, one can obtain more natural incompactness
phenomena, such as the existence of a non-free Abelian group of cardinality
κ+ such that all smaller subgroups are free [15], the existence of a non-
metrizable ﬁrst-countable topological space such that all smaller subspaces
are metrizable (see [14]), and others.

Square sequences appear naturally in core models. In fact, the square prin-
ciple was isolated from the investigation of the structure of the constructible
universe.

Theorem 1.3. [7] Assume V = L. For every cardinal κ, (cid:3)κ holds.

This result was widely generalized, and the best known result today is the

following, due to Zeman.

Theorem 1.4. [22] Assume V = K, where K is the Mitchell-Steel core
model. Then, for every cardinal κ, (cid:3)κ holds.

These results can be stated abstractly (see [19]). Also the square sequences
from these results are global, which means that one can deﬁne a coherent
sequence over all the singular ordinals and derive from it the square sequences
for each cardinal κ. The existence of a global square sequence in the core
model implies that, in order to get a model in which (cid:3)κ fails, we need a model
in which the set of K-singular ordinals below (κ+)V does not contain a club,
or, in other words, that (κ+)V is a Mahlo cardinal in K. Solovay proved that,
indeed, for regular κ, this is the exact large cardinal axiom needed (see [5]).
On the other hand the situation at successors of singular cardinals is more
complex. In the absence of Woodin cardinals, the Weak Covering Lemma,
which states that, for every singular cardinal κ, (κ+)V = (κ+)K , holds, and
therefore (cid:3)κ holds for every singular κ. Some stronger results appear in
[17]. The upper bound for the failure of (cid:3)κ for singular κ is a subcompact
cardinal, which was deﬁned by Jensen as a weakening of a supercompact
cardinal, and this is believed to be optimal (see [4]).

Square principles have many combinatorial consequences; the one that

will be most relevant for us is the failure of stationary reﬂection.

Deﬁnition 1.5. Let λ be a regular cardinal.

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

(1) Suppose S ⊆ λ is a stationary set and α < λ. S reﬂects at α if
cf(α) > ω and S ∩ α is stationary in α. S reﬂects if there is α < λ
such that S reﬂects at α.

(2) Suppose S be a collection of stationary subsets of λ and α < λ. S
reﬂects simultaneously at α if, for all S ∈ S, S reﬂects at α. S reﬂects
simultaneously if there is α < λ such that S reﬂects simultaneously
at α. If S0 and S1 are stationary sets, then we say S0 and S1 reﬂect
simultaneously if {S0, S1} reﬂects simultaneously.

(3) Suppose S ⊆ λ is stationary and κ is a cardinal. Reﬂ(< κ, S) is
the statement asserting that, whenever S is a collection of stationary
subsets of S and |S| < κ, S reﬂects simultaneously. Reﬂ(< κ+, S)
will typically be written as Reﬂ(κ, S), and Reﬂ(1, S) will be written
as Reﬂ(S).

Note that, if S ⊆ λ does not reﬂect at stationarily many ordinals below
λ, then there is a club C ⊆ λ such that C ∩ S does not reﬂect. Thus, if
Reﬂ(< κ, S) holds, then every collection S of stationary subsets of S with
|S| < κ reﬂects simultaneously at stationarily many α < λ.

The following well known theorem demonstrates the connection between

square principles and stationary reﬂection (see [1]).

Theorem 1.6. Assume (cid:3)κ. Then Reﬂ(S) fails for every stationary S ⊆ κ+.

Proof. Let hCα | α < κ+i be a (cid:3)κ sequence and ﬁx a stationary S ⊆ κ+.
Using Fodor’s Lemma, ﬁnd a stationary S′ ⊆ S and δ ≤ κ such that, for
every α ∈ S′, otp(Cα) = δ. For every β < κ+, S′ ∩ acc(Cβ) contains at
most one point, since if α ∈ S′ ∩ acc(Cβ), then Cβ ∩ α = Cα, and therefore
otp(Cβ ∩ α) = δ. Thus, S′ does not reﬂect, so Reﬂ(S) fails.
(cid:3)

The following generalization of Jensen’s square principle is due to Schim-

merling [18]:

Deﬁnition 1.7. Let κ and η be cardinals. A sequence C = hCα | α < κ+i is
a (cid:3)κ,<η sequence if:

(1) For all α < κ+, Cα is a non-empty set of clubs in α and |Cα| < η.
(2) For all β < κ+, C ∈ Cβ, and α ∈ acc(C), C ∩ α ∈ Cα.
(3) For all α < κ+ and C ∈ Cα, otp(C) ≤ κ.

(cid:3)κ,<η is the assertion that there is a (cid:3)κ,<η sequence. We say that C is a
coherent sequence of width < η and length κ+ if it satisﬁes conditions 1 and
2.

This deﬁnition provides us a strict hierarchy of combinatorial principles.
(cid:3)κ,<η =⇒ (cid:3)κ,<η′ for every 1 ≤ η < η′, but it is consistent, relative to
large cardinals, that ¬(cid:3)λ,<η ∧ (cid:3)λ,<η′ holds (See Jensen [8] for successors of
regular cardinals, and Cummings, Foreman, and Magidor [1] for successors
of singulars). We denote by (cid:3)λ,η the principle (cid:3)λ,<η+, so (cid:3)λ is the same as
(cid:3)λ,1.

4

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

The principle (cid:3)λ,λ is called weak square and is equivalent to the existence
of a special λ+-Aronszajn tree. The principle (cid:3)λ,λ+ is called silly square and
is provable in ZFC (see [20, Chapter 2]).

These weaker square principles also have an impact on stationary reﬂec-

tion. The following theorems are from [1].

Theorem 1.8. If κ is an inﬁnite cardinal and (cid:3)κ,<cf(κ) holds, then Reﬂ(S)
fails for every stationary S ⊆ κ+.

Theorem 1.9. If cf(κ) = ω and (cid:3)κ,<κ holds, then Reﬂ(ℵ0, S) fails for every
stationary S ⊆ κ+.

Another way of weakening the deﬁnition of square, due to Todorcevic,
is to replace condition (3), the restriction on order types, with its non-
compactness consequence:

Deﬁnition 1.10. [21] Let λ be a regular cardinal. A coherent sequence
C = hCα | α < λi is a (cid:3)(λ) sequence if there is no club D ⊂ λ such that, for
every α ∈ acc(D), D ∩ α = Cα.

A club D such that D ∩ α = Cα for every α is called a thread through C.
Note that this deﬁnition can be understood as asserting that there is no
way to extend C to a coherent sequence of length λ + 1. Unlike with (cid:3)κ, it is
consistent that one can enlarge the universe and add a thread to some (cid:3)(λ)
sequence without changing the coﬁnality of λ.

As in the case for (cid:3)κ, we are interested in weaker versions of this principle.

Deﬁnition 1.11. Let λ be a regular cardinal, and let η ≤ λ. C = hCα | α <
λi, is a (cid:3)(λ, < η) sequence if it is a coherent sequence of width < η and
there is no club D ⊂ λ such that, for every α ∈ acc(D), D ∩ α ∈ Cα.

In this paper, we investigate the extent to which (cid:3)(λ) and its weakenings
place restrictions on simultaneous reﬂection. In Section 2, we present some
generalizations of a folklore result that (cid:3)(λ) implies the failure of Reﬂ(2, A)
for every stationary S ⊆ λ to square sequences of larger width. In the rest of
the paper, we show that these generalizations are close to sharp. In Section
3, we introduce some of the forcing technology that will be used for this
purpose. In Section 4, we produce models of ZFC in which square principles
and some amount of simultaneous stationary reﬂection hold together. We
conclude with some unresolved questions.

2. ZFC Results

In this section, we prove various results indicating that square principles
place limitations on the extent of simultaneous stationary reﬂection. We ﬁrst
present a folklore result.

Theorem 2.1. Suppose λ is a regular, uncountable cardinal and (cid:3)(λ) holds.
Then every stationary set S ⊆ λ can be partitioned into two stationary sets
that do not reﬂect simultaneously.

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

A proof of Theorem 2.1 can be found in [12]. A stronger version of this
theorem, in which the stationary set is partitioned into λ stationary sets such
that no two reﬂect simultaneously, can be found in [16]. We will present a
diﬀerent proof of Theorem 2.1 that can be modiﬁed to prove a generalization.
We start with some useful deﬁnitions and lemmas, beginning with a result
of Kurepa from [9].

Lemma 2.2. Suppose κ < λ are cardinals, with λ regular, and suppose that
T is a tree of height λ, all of whose levels have size less than κ. Then T has
a coﬁnal branch.

Deﬁnition 2.3. Let C = hCα | α < λi be a coherent sequence of length
λ and any width. A club E ⊆ λ is a weak thread through C if, for every
α ∈ acc(E), there is a C ∈ Cα, such that E ∩ α ⊆ C.

Lemma 2.4. Suppose λ is a regular, uncountable cardinal, κ < λ, and C is
a coherent sequence of length λ and width < κ. If C has a weak thread, then
C has a thread.

Proof. Suppose E is a weak thread through C. We deﬁne the tree of attempts
to construct a thread through C which contains E. Let {γα | α < λ} be an
increasing enumeration of acc(E). Let T = {C | for some α < λ, C ∈ Cγα
and E ∩ γα ⊆ C}, ordered by end-extension. T is then a tree of height λ,
and, for α < λ, the elements of the αth level of T are exactly the members
of T ∩ Cγα. Thus, since C has width < κ, all levels of T are of size < κ.
Since κ < λ, Lemma 2.2 implies that T has a coﬁnal branch. If b is a coﬁnal
branch through T , then S b is a thread through C.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.5. Suppose λ is a regular, uncountable cardinal and C is a coherent
sequence of length λ. Suppose T0 and T1 are unbounded subsets of λ such
that, for every α ∈ T1, there is C ∈ Cα such that T0 ∩ α ⊆ C. Then C has a
weak thread.

Proof. Let E = acc(T0) ∩ acc(T1). We claim that E is a weak thread for C.
To see this, ﬁx α ∈ acc(E), and let β = min(T1 \(α+1)). By our assumption,
there is C ∈ Cβ such that T0 ∩ β ⊆ C. In particular, acc(T0) ∩ β ⊆ acc(C),
which implies that C ∩ α ∈ Cα and E ∩ α ⊆ C ∩ α, as desired.
(cid:3)

We thus obtain the following corollary, which we will often use to prove

that certain coherent sequences have threads.

Corollary 2.6. Suppose λ is a regular, uncountable cardinal, κ < λ, C is
a coherent sequence of length λ and width < κ, and there is an unbounded
A ⊆ λ such that, for all α ∈ A, there is C ∈ Cα such that A ∩ α ⊆ C. Then
C has a thread.

We are now ready to prove Theorem 2.1,

Proof of Theorem 2.1. Let C = hCα | α < λi be a (cid:3)(λ) sequence, and let
S ⊆ λ be a stationary set. We start by splitting λ into two sets according to

6

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

the behaviour of C. Let Tbd = {α < λ | otp(Cα) < α} and Tubd = {α < λ |
otp(Cα) = α}.

Suppose ﬁrst that S ∩ Tbd is stationary. In this case, by Fodor’s Lemma,
we can ﬁnd a stationary S′ ⊆ S ∩ Tbd and a ﬁxed ordinal δ < λ such that,
for all α ∈ S′, otp(Cα) = δ. Then, by the argument in the proof of Theorem
1.6, S′ does not reﬂect. Thus, if S = S0 ˙∪ S1 is any partition of S into
stationary sets with S0 ⊆ S′, then S0 and S1 do not reﬂect simultaneously.
Thus, we may assume that S ∩ Tbd is non-stationary. Let D ⊆ λ be a
club such that D ∩ S ∩ Tbd = ∅. For all β < λ, deﬁne a function pβ :
(D ∩ S) \ (β + 1) → λ by letting pβ(α) be the βth member of Cα, i.e. the
unique γ ∈ Cα such that otp(Cα ∩ γ) = β.

Claim 2.7. There are β, γ0, γ1 < λ such that p−1
stationary.

β (γ0) and p−1

β (γ1) are both

Proof. Suppose not. Then, for every β < λ, ﬁx a club Eβ and an ordinal
γβ < λ such that p−1
β (γβ) ⊇ Eβ ∩ S. If β0 < β1 < λ are limit ordinals and
α ∈ Eβ0 ∩ Eβ1 ∩ S, then γβ0, γβ1 ∈ acc(Cα), so Cγβ1
. Then
S{Cγβ | β < λ, β limit} is a thread through C, which is a contradiction. (cid:3)

∩ γβ0 = Cγβ0

Fix such a β, γ0, and γ1. Let S0 = p−1

β (γ0) and S1 = S \ S0. We claim
that S0 and S1 do not reﬂect simultaneously. To see this, ﬁx α < λ of
uncountable coﬁnality. If otp(Cα) ≤ β or pβ(α) 6= γ0, then acc(Cα)∩ S0 = ∅.
If pβ(α) = γ0, then acc(Cα) \ (γ0 + 1) ∩ S1 = ∅. In either case, S0 and S1 do
not reﬂect simultaneously at α.
(cid:3)

2.1. Finite width. We now generalize Theorem 2.1 to square sequences of
larger width. We start by considering sequences of ﬁnite width.

Theorem 2.8. Suppose λ is a regular, uncountable cardinal and (cid:3)(λ, < ω)
holds. Then, for all stationary S ⊆ λ, Reﬂ(2, S) fails.

Proof. Let C = hCα | α < λi be a (cid:3)(λ, < ω) sequence. For each α < λ, we
let Cα = {Cα,i | i < nα} and, for convenience, we assume that the clubs are
enumerated so that, for all i0 < i1 < nα, otp(Cα,i0) ≤ otp(Cα,i1). For all
α ∈ S, let mα ≤ nα be least such that either otp(Cα,mα) = α or mα = nα.
By shrinking S if necessary, we may assume that there are m ≤ n < ω and
hηi | i < mi such that, for all α ∈ S, mα = m, nα = n, and, for all i < m,
otp(Cα,i) = ηi. We may also assume that S consists only of indecomposable
ordinals, i.e. α such that, for all β, δ < α, we have β + δ < α.

Case 1: m = n. In this case, S itself does not reﬂect. To see this, ﬁx
δ < λ with cf(δ) > ω, and let C ∈ Cδ. If α ∈ S ∩ acc(C), then C ∩ α ∈ Cα,
so otp(C ∩ α) ∈ {ηi | i < m}. Thus, |S ∩ acc(C)| ≤ m. In particular, a
ﬁnal segment of acc(C) is disjoint from S and thus witnesses that S does
not reﬂect at δ.

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

Case 2: m = 0. For each α ∈ S and i < n, let Cα,i be enumerated in
| β < α}. For each β < λ, deﬁne a function pβ on

increasing order by {ξα,i
β
S \ (β + 1) by letting pβ = {ξα,i
β

| i < n}.

Lemma 2.9. Suppose that, for every β < λ, there is a club Eβ ⊆ λ and an
ordinal γβ < λ such that pβ(α) ∩ γβ 6= ∅ for every α ∈ Eβ ∩ S. Then there
is a club F ⊆ λ such that, for every α ∈ S ∩ acc(F ), F ∩ α ⊆ S Cα.

Proof. Let D be the club of all limit ordinals δ < λ such that, for all β < δ,
γβ < δ. Let F = D ∩ △β<λEβ. We claim that F is as desired. To this end,
let α ∈ S ∩ acc(F ), and let δ ∈ F ∩ α. Since α ∈ S ∩ Tβ<δ Eβ, we have that,
α,iβ
for all β < δ, there is iβ < n such that β ≤ ξ
β < δ. Fix i < n such that
iβ = i for unboundedly many β < δ. Then δ ∈ Cα,i, so F ∩ α ⊆ S Cα.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.10. Suppose there is a club F ⊆ λ such that, for every α ∈
S ∩ acc(F ), F ∩ α ⊆ S Cα. Then C has a thread.

Proof. For every α ∈ S ∩ acc(F ), let kα be the size of the smallest subset
C′
α ⊆ Cα that covers F ∩ α up to a bounded error, i.e. such that there is
βα < α such that F ∩ (βα, α) ⊆ S C′
α. By Fodor’s Lemma, there is k∗ < ω,
β∗ < λ, and a stationary T ⊆ S ∩ acc(F ) such that, for all α ∈ T , kα = k∗
and βα = β∗ (in particular, α > β∗).
Claim 2.11. For all α ∈ T and all C ∈ C′

α, T ∩ α ⊆ acc(C).

Proof. Fix α ∈ T and δ ∈ T ∩ α, let Dα = {C ∈ C′
α | δ 6∈ acc(C)}, and
suppose for sake of contradiction that Dα 6= ∅. Fix β such that β∗ ≤ β < δ
and, for all C ∈ Dα, C ∩ (β, δ) = ∅.
It must therefore be the case that
F ∩ (β, δ) ⊆ S(C′
δ | < k∗
δ , contradicting the fact that kδ = k∗ (since δ ∈ T ). (cid:3)
and F ∩ (β, δ) ⊆ S C′′
(cid:3)

Thus, by Corollary 2.6 applied to T , C has a thread.

α \ Dα}. Then |C′′

α \ Dα). Let C′′

δ = {C ∩ δ | C ∈ C′

Combining these two lemmas, we see that there must be an ordinal β < λ
such that, for every γ < λ, there are stationarily many α ∈ S such that
pβ(α) ∩ γ = ∅. Fix such a β. By shrinking S if necessary, we may assume
S ⊆ λ \ (β + 1). For a ﬁnite set of ordinals below λ, v, let Sv = p−1

β (v).

Lemma 2.12. Let ℓ < ω and suppose that, for all k < ℓ, vk is a ﬁnite set
of ordinals below λ. If Tk<ℓ vk = ∅, then S = {Svk | k < ℓ} does not reﬂect
simultaneously.

Proof. Let β < δ < λ with cf(δ) > ω, let C = T Cδ, and let pβ(δ) = u. Note
that, for every γ ∈ S ∩ acc(C), pβ(γ) ⊇ u. This is because D ∩ γ ∈ Cγ for
every D ∈ Cδ, and the βth element of D ∩ γ is the same as the βth element
of D. Since T vi = ∅, there is k < ℓ such that vk 6⊇ u, and this implies that
Svk does not reﬂect at δ.
(cid:3)

By Fodor’s Lemma, we can ﬁnd a stationary set S0 ⊆ S and a ﬁnite set
v0 ⊆ λ such that pβ“S0 = {v0}. Let γ0 = max(v0). By our choice of β, there

8

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

are stationarily many α ∈ S such that pβ(α) ∩ (γ0 + 1) = ∅, so, through
another application of Fodor’s Lemma, we can ﬁnd a stationary S1 ⊆ S and
a ﬁnite v1 ⊆ λ such that pβ“S1 = {v1} and v1 ∩ (γ0 + 1) = ∅. In particular,
v1 ∩ v0 = ∅, so we can apply Lemma 2.12 and conclude that S0 and S1 do
not reﬂect simultaneously.

Case 3: 0 < m < n. We will reduce this case to Case 2. Recall that
hηi | i < mi is such that, for all α ∈ S and all i < m, otp(Cα,i) = ηi. For each
α < λ and each C ∈ Cα, deﬁne C ∗ as follows. If otp(C) ≤ η0, let C ∗ = C.
Otherwise, let iC < m be greatest such that ηiC < otp(C), let ξ ∈ C be such
that otp(C ∩ ξ) = ηiC , and let C ∗ = C \ (ξ + 1). Deﬁne C∗ = hC∗
α | α < λi by
α = {C ∗ | C ∈ Cα}. It is routine to check that C∗ is a
letting, for all α < λ, C∗
(cid:3)(λ, < ω) sequence. Suppose α ∈ S and i < n. If i < m, we have arranged
β, C ∗ ∩ α 6= C ∗
that, for all α < β < λ and all C ∗ ∈ C∗
α,i. If m ≤ i < n,
then, since α is indecomposable, otp(C ∗
α,i) = α. For α < λ, deﬁne Dα by
letting Dα = C∗
α,i | m ≤ i < n} for α ∈ S. Then
D = hDα | α < λi is a (cid:3)(λ, < ω) sequence and, for all α ∈ S and all D ∈ Dα,
otp(D) = α. We may thus proceed as in Case 2, using D in place of C. (cid:3)

α for α 6∈ S and Dα = {C ∗

The proof of Theorem 2.8 uses the fact that the width of the square
sequence is ﬁnite in two places. The ﬁrst is in ﬁnding a value v ∈ κ<ω such
that p−1
β (v) is stationary, and the second is in the proof of Lemma 2.10. We
will see later that the generalization of Lemma 2.10 to coherent sequences of
inﬁnite width is false. In fact, we will see that, if κ < λ are inﬁnite, regular
cardinals, then there is consistently a (cid:3)(λ, κ) sequence C = hCα | α < λi
such that, for every limit ordinal α < λ, α = S Cα.

2.2. Inﬁnite width. We move on now to consider square sequences of possi-
bly inﬁnite width. We ﬁrst show that the existence of such square sequences
necessarily implies the failure of some simultaneous reﬂection for stationary
sets consisting of ordinals of suﬃciently high coﬁnality.

Theorem 2.13. Suppose κ < λ are cardinals, λ is regular, and (cid:3)(λ, < κ)
holds. Then Reﬂ(< κ, S) fails for all stationary S ⊆ Sλ

≥κ.

Proof. Suppose for sake of contradiction that S ⊆ Sλ
≥κ is stationary and
Reﬂ(< κ, S) holds. Let C = hCα | α < λi be a (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-sequence. For
≥κ and C is a (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-
all β ∈ S, let Dβ = TC∈Cβ
sequence, Dβ is club in β for all β ∈ S. For all α < λ, let Sα = {β ∈ S | α ∈
Dβ}. Let A = {α < λ | Sα is stationary}.

acc(C). Since S ⊆ Sλ

Claim 2.14. A is unbounded in λ.

Proof. Fix α0 < λ. For β ∈ S \ (α0 + 1), let f (β) = min(Dβ \ α0). f is
regressive, so, by Fodor’s Lemma, we can ﬁnd α and a stationary S′ ⊆ S
such that f (β) = α for all β ∈ S′. Then α ∈ A \ α0. Since α0 was arbitrary,
A is unbounded in λ.
(cid:3)

Claim 2.15. Suppose γ ∈ A and X ∈ [A ∩ γ]<κ. Then there is C ∈ Cγ such
that X ⊆ C.

Proof. By assumption, S = {Sα | α ∈ X ∪ {γ}} reﬂects simultaneously.
Suppose S reﬂects simultaneously at δ. Fix E ∈ Cδ. For every α ∈ X ∪ {γ},
let βα ∈ acc(E) ∩ Sα. Then, since α ∈ Dβα and E ∩ βα ∈ Cβα, we have
α ∈ acc(E). In particular, E ∩ γ ∈ Cγ and X ⊆ E ∩ γ.
(cid:3)

Claim 2.16. Suppose γ ∈ A. Then there is C ∈ Cγ such that A ∩ γ ⊆ C.

Proof. Suppose not. For every C ∈ Cγ, ﬁnd αC ∈ (A ∩ γ) \ C. Let X =
{αC | C ∈ Cγ}. Then X ∈ [A ∩ γ]<κ, so, by Claim 2.15, there is C ∈ Cγ such
that X ⊆ C. In particular, αC ∈ C, contradicting our assumption.
(cid:3)

By Corollary 2.6 applied to A, C has a thread, contradicting the assump-
(cid:3)

tion that C is a (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-sequence.

We now introduce a dichotomy for square sequences and show that, in

each case, we get further failure of simultaneous stationary reﬂection.

Deﬁnition 2.17. Suppose λ is a regular, uncountable cardinal and C = hCα |
α < λi is a coherent sequence of any width. Let AC be the set of α < λ such
that there is a club Dα ⊆ λ such that, for every β ∈ Dα, α ∈ SC∈Cβ
acc(C).
C is full if AC is unbounded in λ.

Theorem 2.18. Suppose κ < λ are uncountable cardinals, with λ regular,
and suppose there is a full (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-sequence. Then Reﬂ(< κ, S) fails for
all stationary S ⊆ λ.

Proof. Suppose C = hCα | α < λi is a full (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-sequence, and let S ⊆ λ
be stationary. Let AC be as given in the deﬁnition of fullness. Find an
unbounded A ⊆ AC and a ﬁxed µ < κ such that, for all α ∈ A, |Cα| = µ.
For each α ∈ A, let Cα = {Cα,i | i < µ}, and let Dα be club in λ such that,
for all β ∈ Dα, α ∈ SC∈Cβ

acc(C).

For all α ∈ A and i < µ, let Sα,i be the set of β ∈ S such that, for all

C ∈ Cβ, C ∩ α 6= Cα,i.

Claim 2.19. For all but boundedly many α ∈ A, for all i < µ, Sα,i is sta-
tionary.

Proof. Suppose for sake of contradiction that there is an unbounded B ⊆ A
and, for all α ∈ B, an iα < µ such that Sα,iα is non-stationary. For all
α ∈ B, ﬁx a club Eα in λ such that Eα ∩Sα,iα = ∅. Deﬁne a tree T as follows.
Elements of T are clubs Cα,iα for α ∈ B. Order T by end-extension, i.e., for
all α0 < α1, both in B, let Cα0,iα0

∩ α0 = Cα0,iα0

<T Cα1,iα1

This deﬁnition clearly makes T a tree, and |T | = λ. We claim that T
has no antichain of size κ. To see this, let T ′ be a subset of T of size κ.
Suppose T ′ = {Cαξ ,iαξ
| ξ < κ}. Find β ∈ S ∩ Tξ<κ Eαξ . For all ξ < κ,
β ∈ S \ Tαξ,iαξ
. Since

, so there is C ∈ Cβ such that C ∩ αξ = Cαξ,iαξ

iﬀ Cα1,iα1

.

10

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

|Cβ| < κ, there are ξ < ζ < κ and C ∈ Cβ such that C ∩ αξ = Cαξ,iαξ
C ∩ αζ = Cαζ ,iαζ
have Cαζ ,iαζ

and
. Assuming without loss of generality that αξ < αζ, we then

∩ αξ = Cαξ,iαξ

, so T ′ is not an antichain.

In particular, every level of T has size < κ. T is thus a tree of height λ
with levels of size < κ, so, by Lemma 2.2, T has a coﬁnal branch, b. But
then S b is a thread for C, which is a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Fix α ∈ A such that, for all i < µ, Sα,i is stationary. For i < µ, let
Si = Sα,i ∩ Dα. We claim that {Si | i < µ} does not reﬂect simultaneously.
To see this, suppose for sake of contradiction that {Si
| i < µ} reﬂects
simultaneously at δ. Since each Si is a subset of Dα, we must have δ ∈ Dα.
There is thus C ∈ Cδ such that α ∈ acc(C). Fix i∗ < µ such that C ∩ α =
Cα,i∗. Let D = acc(C) \ (α + 1). Then D is club in δ and, for all β ∈ D,
C ∩ β ∈ Cβ, so D ∩ Si∗ = ∅. In particular, Si∗ does not reﬂect at δ, which is
a contradiction.
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.20. Suppose κ < λ are regular, uncountable cardinals and there
is a (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-sequence that is not full. Then Reﬂ(2, λ) fails.

Proof. Let C = hCα | α < λi be a (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-sequence that is not full. Then
AC is bounded in λ, so there is α′ < λ such that, for all α′ ≤ α < λ, there
is a stationary Sα ⊆ λ such that, for all β ∈ Sα, α 6∈ SC∈Cβ
acc(C). For
acc(C)}. Let B = {α < λ | Tα is
each α < λ, let Tα = {β < λ | α ∈ TC∈Cβ
stationary}.

Claim 2.21. B is unbounded in λ.

acc(C) is club in β. Deﬁne a function f : Sλ

Proof. Fix α0 < λ. We will ﬁnd α ∈ B \ α0. Note that, for all β ∈ Sλ
≥κ,
≥κ \ (α0 + 1) → λ by
TC∈Cβ
acc(C)) \ α0). f is a regressive function on a
letting f (β) = min((TC∈Cβ
stationary set, so there is a stationary T and a ﬁxed α such that, for all
β ∈ T , f (β) = α. Then α ∈ B \ α0.
(cid:3)

Fix α ∈ B \ α′. We claim that Sα and Tα do not reﬂect simultaneously.
To see this, ﬁx δ < λ of uncountable coﬁnality, and ﬁx C ∈ Cδ. Let D =
acc(C) \ (α + 1). If α ∈ acc(C), then D ∩ Sα = ∅, so Sα does not reﬂect at
δ. If α 6∈ acc(C), then D ∩ Tα = ∅, so Tα does not reﬂect at δ.
(cid:3)

Using the ideas of the previous proofs we can show that proper forcing

cannot add a thread to any narrow square sequence.

Corollary 2.22. Let κ < λ be cardinals, with λ uncountable and regular. A
proper forcing cannot add a thread to a (cid:3)(λ, < κ) sequence.

Proof. Let C = hCα,i | α < λ, i < µα < κi be a (cid:3)(λ, < κ) sequence. For
α < λ and i < µα, let Sα,i = {β ∈ Sλ
ω | ∀j < µβ, Cβ,j ∩ α 6= Cα,i}. By the
proof of Theorem 2.18, we know that, for all suﬃciently large α < λ, for all
i < µα, Sα,i is stationary.

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

11

Let P be a forcing notion and let us assume that P adds a thread through C.
In V P, let D be this thread, and let α < λ be a suﬃciently large accumulation
point of D. Then there is i such that D∩α = Cα,i. Sα,i ∩acc(D)\(α+1) = ∅,
and therefore Sα,i is non-stationary in V P. In particular, P does not preserve
stationary subsets of Sλ
(cid:3)

ω and therefore is not proper.

Remark 2.23. A (cid:3)(λ, < λ)-sequence can be λ-c.c. and, in particular, its
threading forcing (which will be introduced in Section 3) can preserve any
stationary subset of λ. It can also be σ-closed (unless there is µ < λ such
that µω ≥ λ), and in this case the threading forcing will be proper.

3. Forcing preliminaries

3.1. Adding a square sequence. In this subsection we will describe the
standard forcing for adding a (cid:3)(λ) sequence. This forcing notion (in a
slightly diﬀerent form) is due to Jensen, who used it in order to separate
the combinatorial principles (cid:3)ω1 and (cid:3)ω1,2. We will state but not prove the
basic properties of the forcing notion and refer the reader to [12] for further
information and discussion.

Throughout this subsection, λ is an arbitrary uncountable regular cardinal

such that λ<λ = λ.

Deﬁnition 3.1. S(λ, 1) is the forcing notion for adding a (cid:3)(λ) sequence
with bounded approximations. A condition s ∈ S(λ, 1) is a sequence of the
form s = hsi | i ≤ γi where:

(1) γ < λ;
(2) for all α ≤ γ, if α is a limit ordinal then sα is a closed unbounded

subset of α;

(3) for all α < β < λ, if α ∈ acc(sβ), then sα = sβ ∩ α.

The elements of S(λ, 1) are ordered by end-extension.

By genericity arguments, if S ⊆ S(λ, 1) is a generic ﬁlter, then C = S S
is a (cid:3)(λ) = (cid:3)(λ, 1) sequence (thus the index 1). In this case, we do not
distinguish between C and S and say that C is a generic (cid:3)(λ) sequence.

Deﬁnition 3.2. Let C be a (cid:3)(λ)-sequence. Then T(C) is the threading
forcing for C. The elements of T(C) are the members of C and the order of
the forcing is end-extension.

When C is clear from the context, we omit it. Let us remark that, if C is a
generic (cid:3)(λ) sequence, then TC is non-atomic and, if T ⊆ T(C) is a generic
ﬁlter, then S T is a thread through C. In this case, the forcing S(λ, 1) ∗ T(C)
contains a dense λ-directed closed subset.

Deﬁnition 3.3. Let T be a forcing notion, and let S ⊆ λ. S is T-fragile if
(cid:13)T “ ˇS is non-stationary.”
Lemma 3.4. Let S be a forcing notion and let T be a forcing notion in V S.
Assume that S ∗ ˙T contains a λ-directed closed dense subset.

12

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

Let P be an iteration (of any length), taken with supports of size < λ, in
V S, and assume that every step in the iteration consists of shooting a club
through the complement of a T-fragile subset of λ. Then S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T contains a
λ-directed closed dense subset. Moreover, after forcing with S ∗ ˙T, P contains
a dense λ-directed closed subset.
Proof. In V S, let hPα, ˙Qβ | α ≤ µ, β < µi be an iteration as described in the
statement of the Lemma, with P = Pµ. For β < µ, let ˙Sβ be the Pβ-name for
a T-fragile subset of λ used to deﬁne ˙Qβ. Let ˙Cβ be a Pβ ∗ T-name for a club
in λ disjoint from ˙Sβ. Working in V , we will abuse notation and interpret ˙Sβ
and ˙Cβ as S ∗ ˙Pβ and S ∗ ˙Pβ ∗ ˙T-names, respectively. Let U0 be the λ-directed
closed subset of S ∗ ˙T. Let U be the set of (s, ˙p, ˙t) ∈ S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T such that:

• (s, ˙t) ∈ U0;
• there is a ∈ V such that s (cid:13)S “ dom( ˙p) = ˇa”;
• for all α ∈ a, there is a closed, bounded cα ⊂ λ such that (s, ˙p ↾

α) (cid:13)S∗ ˙Pα

“ ˙p(α) = ˇcα”;

• for all α ∈ a, (s, ˙p ↾ α, ˙t) (cid:13)S∗ ˙Pα∗ ˙T “ max(ˇcα) ∈ ˙Cα.”

The proof that U is a dense, λ-directed closed subset can be found in [10].
The ﬁnal sentence in the statement of the Lemma follows immediately. (cid:3)

Corollary 3.5. There is a forcing notion Q such that:

(1) |Q| = 2λ and Q is λ+-c.c.
(2) There is T ∈ V Q of cardinality λ such that Q∗ ˙T contains a λ-directed

closed dense subset.

(3) (cid:13)Q “(cid:3)(λ).”
(4) In V Q, there are no T-fragile stationary subsets of λ.

Proof. We apply Lemma 3.4 for S = S(λ, 1), T = T(C), (where C is the
generic (cid:3)(λ) sequence added by S), and P the iteration of length 2λ, taken
with supports of size < λ, killing all T-fragile stationary subsets of λ (with
appropriate bookkeeping). Let Q = S ∗ ˙P.

The only part of the corollary that requires further argument is (3). It
suﬃces to show that the iteration P cannot add a thread through the (cid:3)(λ)
sequence C generically added by S. By Lemma 3.4, after forcing over V S
with T, P has a λ-directed closed dense subset. In particular, forcing with
P × P in V S preserves the regularity of λ. But if P adds a thread through C,
then P × P will add two distinct threads to C, thus forcing cf(λ) = ω.
(cid:3)

The discussion above translates with minimal changes to the case of square

sequences with arbitrary width.

Deﬁnition 3.6. Let λ be a regular cardinal, and let κ ≤ λ. S(λ, < κ) is the
forcing notion for adding a (cid:3)(λ, < κ) sequence using bounded approxima-
tions. A condition s ∈ S(λ, < κ) is a sequence of the form s = hsi | i ≤ γi
where

(1) γ < λ.

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

13

(2) For all α ≤ γ, if α is a limit ordinal, then sα is a non-empty set of

closed, unbounded subsets of α, and |sα| < κ.

(3) For all α < β ≤ γ and all C ∈ sβ, if α ∈ acc(C), then C ∩ α ∈ sα.

The elements of S(λ, < κ) are ordered by end-extension.

Deﬁnition 3.7. Let C be a (cid:3)(λ, < κ)-sequence. Then T(C) is the threading
forcing for C. The elements of T(C) are the members of S C, and the order
of the forcing is end-extension.

For a forcing P and a cardinal ν, let Pν denote the full-support product

of ν copies of P.
Lemma 3.8. For every ρ < κ the forcing S(λ, < κ) ∗ ˙T(C)ρ has a κ-directed
closed dense subset.

Corollary 3.9. Let λ be a regular cardinal, and let κ ≤ λ. There is a forcing
notion Q such that:

(1) |Q| = 2λ and Q is λ+-c.c.
(2) There is T ∈ V Q of cardinality λ such that Q ∗ ˙Tρ has a λ-directed

closed dense subset for all ρ < κ.

(3) (cid:13)Q “(cid:3)(λ, < κ).”
(4) In V Q, there are no T-fragile stationary subsets of λ.

3.2. Adding an indexed square sequence. We now introduce an indexed
strengthening of (cid:3)(λ, κ).

Deﬁnition 3.10. Let κ < λ be inﬁnite regular cardinals. C = hCα,i | α <
λ, i(α) ≤ i < κi is a (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence if the following hold.

(1) For all α < λ, i(α) < κ.
(2) For all limit α < λ and i(α) ≤ i < κ, Cα,i is club in α.
(3) For all limit α < λ and i(α) ≤ i < j < κ, Cα,i ⊆ Cα,j.
(4) For all limit α < β < λ and i(β) ≤ i < κ, if α ∈ acc(Cβ,i), then

i(α) ≤ i and Cβ,i ∩ α = Cα,i.

(5) For all limit α < β < λ, there is i(β) ≤ i < κ such that α ∈ acc(Cβ,i).
(6) There is no club D ⊆ λ such that, for all α ∈ acc(D), there is

i(α) ≤ i < κ such that D ∩ α = Cα,i.

(cid:3)ind(λ, κ) holds if there is a (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence.

µ,cf(µ) studied in [1] and [2].

Remark 3.11. (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) is a generalization of the indexed square notion
(cid:3)ind
In the forcing constructions used in those
papers to add (cid:3)ind
µ,κ sequences, it is important that µ is singular and κ = cf(µ).
Removing the order-type restriction and moving to (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) gives us much
more freedom with regards to the width and length of our indexed square
sequences, and this freedom will be exploited in consistency results later in
the paper.

It is clear that a (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence is a full (cid:3)(λ, κ) sequence and so, by
Theorem 2.18, (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) implies the failure of Reﬂ(κ, S) for every stationary

S ⊆ λ. We will see in Section 4 that this is sharp. The following is easily
seen. A proof can be found in [11].

Lemma 3.12. Let κ < λ be regular cardinals. The above deﬁnition of a
(cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence is unchanged if item (6) is replaced by the following seem-
ingly weaker condition:

There is no club D ⊆ λ and i < κ such that, ∀α ∈ acc(D), D ∩ α = Cα,i.

We now deﬁne a forcing poset designed to add an indexed square sequence.

Deﬁnition 3.13. Suppose κ < λ are inﬁnite regular cardinals. Sind(λ, κ) is
a forcing poset whose conditions are all p = hC p
α,i | α ≤ γp, i(α)p ≤ i < κi
satisfying the following conditions.

(1) γp < λ is a limit ordinal and, for all α ≤ γp, i(α)p < κ.
(2) For all limit α ≤ γp and all i(α)p ≤ i < κ, C p
(3) For all limit α ≤ γp and all i(α)p ≤ i < j < κ, C p
α,j.
(4) For all limit α < β ≤ γp and all i(β)p ≤ i < κ, if α ∈ acc(C p

α,i is a club in α.

α,i ⊆ C p

β,i), then

i(α)p ≤ i and C p

β,i ∩ α = C p

α,i.

(5) For all limit α < β ≤ γp, there is i(β)p ≤ i < κ such that α ∈

acc(C p

β,i).

If p, q ∈ Sind(λ, κ), then q ≤ p iﬀ q end-extends p.

The following is proven in [11].

Lemma 3.14. Let κ < λ be regular cardinals, and let S = Sind(λ, κ).

(1) S is κ-directed closed.
(2) S is λ-strategically closed.
(3) If G is S-generic over V and C = S G, then C is a (cid:3)ind(λ, κ)-sequence

in V [G].

We now introduce a family of forcings designed to thread an indexed

square sequence.

Deﬁnition 3.15. Let κ < λ be regular cardinals, let C = hCα,i
| α <
λ, i(α) ≤ i < κi be a (cid:3)ind(λ, κ)-sequence, and let i < κ. Ti(C) is the forcing
poset whose conditions are all Cα,i such that α < λ is a limit ordinal and
i(α) ≤ i. Ti(C) is ordered by end-extension.

Lemma 3.16. Let κ < λ be regular cardinals, and let S = Sind(λ, κ). Let
˙C = h ˙Cα,i | α < ˇλ, ˙i(α) ≤ i < ˇκi be a canonical S-name for the generically-
introduced (cid:3)ind(λ, κ)-sequence and, for i < κ, let ˙Ti be an S-name for Ti( ˙C).

(1) For all i < κ, S ∗ ˙Ti has a dense λ-directed closed subset.
(2) Let i < j < κ and, in V S, deﬁne πi,j : Ti → Tj by letting, for all

Cα,i ∈ Ti, πi,j(Cα,i) = Cα,j. Then πi,j is a projection.

Proof. We ﬁrst establish (1). The proof is standard but included for com-
pleteness. Fix i < κ, and let Ui be the set of (p, ˙t) ∈ S ∗ ˙Ti such that

γ,j = C p0

γp0 ,j ∪ {γp0 + n | n < ω}. Let t = C p

p (cid:13) “˙i(γp) ≤ i and ˙t = ˙Cγp,i”. We ﬁrst show that Ui is dense. To this end,
ﬁx (p0, ˙t0) ∈ S ∗ ˙Ti. By strengthening p0 if necessary, we may assume that
there is α < λ such that p0 (cid:13) “ ˙t0 = ˙Cα,i” and that γp0 ≥ α. Let γ = γp0 + ω.
We will deﬁne p ≤ p0 with γp = γ. To do this, we need only specify i(γ)p
and C p
γ,j for i(γ)p ≤ j < κ. Let i(γ)p = i. Let j∗ < κ be least such that
α ∈ acc(C p0
α,j ∪ {α} ∪ {γp0 + n | n < ω}. If
i, j∗ ≤ j < κ, let C p
γ,i, and let ˙t
be an S-name forced to be equal to t. Then (p, ˙t) ≤ (p0, ˙t0), and (p, ˙t) ∈ Ui.
We next show that Ui is λ-directed closed. Note ﬁrst that Ui is tree-like,
i.e. if u, v, w ∈ Ui and w ≤ u, v, then u and v are comparable.
It thus
suﬃces to show that Ui is λ-closed. Thus, let η < λ be a limit ordinal, and
let h(pξ, ˙tξ) | ξ < ηi be a strictly decreasing sequence of conditions from
Ui. Let γ = sup({γpξ | ξ < η}). We ﬁrst deﬁne p ∈ S so that γp = γ. It
suﬃces to deﬁne i(γ)p and C p
γ,j for i(γ)p ≤ j < κ. Let i(γ)p = i and, for
i(γ)p ≤ j < κ, let C p
γ,i, and let ˙t be an S-name
forced to be equal to t. It is easily veriﬁed that (p, ˙t) is a lower bound for
h(pξ, ˙tξ) | ξ < ηi and that (p, ˙t) ∈ Ui.

γξ ,j. Let t = C p

γ,j = C p0

γ,j = Sξ<η C

We ﬁnally show (2). Let G be S-generic over V , and, in V [G], let C =
hCα,i | α < λ, i(α) ≤ i < κi be the generically added (cid:3)ind(λ, κ)-sequence.
Fix i < j < κ. It is clear that πi,j is order-preserving. It thus suﬃces to show
that, for all t0 ∈ Ti and s ≤ πi,j(t0) in Tj, there is t ≤ t0 in Ti such that
πi,j(t) ≤ s. Fix such a t0 and s. Let t0 = Cγ0,i and s = Cγ1,j. By an easy
density argument, we can ﬁnd γ2 < λ such that i(γ2) ≤ i, γ0 ∈ acc(Cγ2,i),
and γ1 ∈ acc(Cγ2,j). Let t = Cγ2,i. Then t ≤ t0 and πi,j(t) ≤ s.
(cid:3)

An argument similar to that in the proof of Lemma 3.4 yields the following

Lemma.

Lemma 3.17. Suppose κ < λ are inﬁnite, regular cardinals, S = Sind(λ, κ),
and, in V S, C is the generically-added (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence. In V S let T =
Li<κ Ti (the lottery sum of all the threading forcings Ti(C) for i < κ). Also
in V S, let P be an iteration, taken with supports of size < λ, destroying the
stationarity of T-fragile subsets of λ. Then for every i < κ, S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙Ti has a
dense λ-directed closed subset and, in V S∗ ˙Ti, P has a dense λ-directed closed
subset.

3.3. Indestructible Stationary Reﬂection. In this subsection we gather
a few theorems of similar ﬂavour which are independent from the other parts
of this paper.

These theorems show that, given large cardinals, one can force simulta-
neous stationary reﬂection at many cardinals. The large cardinals that are
required depend on the nature of the cardinal at which we force the station-
ary reﬂection. These results will be used in Section 4, in which our forcing

16

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

arguments will require that simultaneous stationary reﬂection is indestruc-
tible under suﬃciently closed forcing. For notational ease, we thus make the
following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.18. Suppose λ is a regular, uncountable cardinal, κ ≤ λ, and
S ⊆ λ is stationary. Then Reﬂ∗(< κ, S) is the statement that, whenever P
is a λ-directed closed forcing poset and |P| ≤ λ, then (cid:13)P “ Reﬂ(< κ, ˇS)”.
Reﬂ∗(κ, S) is given the obvious meaning.

Remark 3.19. Since the trivial forcing is λ-directed closed, Reﬂ∗(< κ, S)
implies Reﬂ(< κ, S).

The next theorem is well known, but since we require Reﬂ∗(ω1, Sω2

ω ) rather

than the more standard Reﬂ(ω1, Sω2

ω ), we give a detailed proof.

Theorem 3.20. The following are equiconsistent over ZFC.

(1) There is a weakly compact cardinal.
(2) Reﬂ∗(ω1, Sω2

ω ).

Proof. The equiconsistency of a weakly compact cardinal and Reﬂ(2, Sω2
ω )
is proven in [13]. Thus, it will suﬃce to show that, starting with a weakly
compact cardinal, we can force Reﬂ∗(ω1, Sω2

ω ).

Let κ be a weakly compact cardinal and assume GCH. We deﬁne an
iteration hLα, ˙Cβ | α ≤ κ, β < κi, taken with countable supports. For
α < κ, let ˙Cα be an Lα-name for a two-step iteration, where the ﬁrst iterand
is the lottery sum of all α-directed closed forcing notions of size |α| from
V Lα
α+ω and the second iterand is Col(ω1, α). Let L = Lκ.
L is κ-c.c. and σ-closed.

It is clear that every cardinal ω1 < β < κ is
collapsed, so (cid:13)L ˇκ = ℵ2. We claim that Reﬂ∗(ω1, Sω2
ω ) holds in V L. To see
this, let P be an ω2-directed closed forcing of size ω2 in V L. Let { ˙Si | i < ω1}
be a collection of names for stationary subsets of Sω2

ω in V L∗P. Let

j : hVκ, L ∗ P, { ˙Si | i < ω1}, ∈i → hM, j(L) ∗ j(P), {j( ˙Si) | i < ω1}, ∈i
be a weakly compact embedding (we assume, for simplicity, that P ⊆ κ).

Let G be a V -generic ﬁlter for L, let H be a V [G]-generic ﬁlter for P, and
let C be a V [G][H]-generic ﬁlter for Col(ω1, κ). We now build in V [G][H][C]
an M -generic ﬁlter K ∗ J for j(L) ∗ j(P) such that j“G ∗ H ⊆ K ∗ J.

Since L is an iteration with bounded support at κ, for every q ∈ L,
j(q) = q. Thus, we can let the portion of K up to stage κ to be equal to G.
Moreover, since P ∈ M , we can pick the κth stage of the iteration j(L) to
be P ∗ Col(ω1, κ) and take H ∗ C to be the portion of K at stage κ. For the
stages strictly between κ and j(κ), we claim that we can ﬁnd an M [G][H][C]-
generic ﬁlter in V [G][H][C]. This is true because the forcing is σ-closed,
V [G][H][C] |= |M [G][H][C]| = ω1 and ωM [G][H][C] ⊆ M [G][H][C]. Thus,
can we enumerate the dense open sets of the tail of the iteration that lie in
M [G][H][C] in a sequence of length ω1 and build a suitable generic ﬁlter.
This completes the construction of K.

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

17

Finally, since j(P) is j(κ)-directed closed and j“H = H ∈ M [G][H] (since
we assumed that P ⊂ κ and therefore its conditions do not move under j),
there is a condition p⋆ ∈ j(P) such that p⋆ ≤ j(p) for every p ∈ H. We build
in V [G][H][C] an M [K]-generic ﬁlter, J, below this master condition. Thus,
in V [G][H][C], there is an elementary embedding
˜j : Vκ[G][H] → M [K][J].

Since Col(ω1, κ) is σ-closed, for each i < ω1, V [G][H][C] |= “Si is stationary.”
In particular, M [K][J] |= “Si is stationary, ” and therefore, since, for all
i < ω1, ˜j(Si) ∩ κ = Si, we have M [K][J] |= “j({Si | i < ω1}) reﬂects simul-
taneously at κ.” Since ˜j is elementary, {Si | i < ω1} reﬂects simultaneously
in Vκ[G][H].
(cid:3)

We quote the following theorem from [1, Section 6.3].

Theorem 3.21. If the existence of inﬁnitely many supercompact cardinals
ℵω+1
is consistent, then it is consistent that, for all n < ω, Ref l∗(< ℵω, S
)
≤ℵn
holds.

The indestructibility of the stationary reﬂection at ℵω+1 is not mentioned

explicitly in [1], but it follows easily from the proof of the theorem.

Theorem 3.22. If the existence of an inaccessible limit of supercompact
cardinals is consistent, then it is consistent that, letting κ be the least inac-
cessible cardinal, Reﬂ∗(< κ, κ) holds.

Proof. Let κ be the least inaccessible limit of supercompact cardinals, and
let {µi | i < κ} be a continuous, increasing sequence of cardinals coﬁnal in
κ such that:

(1) µ0 = ω;
(2) for all limit ordinals i < κ, µi+1 = µ+
i ;
(3) for all successor ordinals i < κ, µi+1 is supercompact.

Let P be the Easton-support iteration of Col(µi+1, < µi+2) for i < κ. In V P,
we have µi = ℵi for all i < κ and κ is the least inaccessible cardinal. We
claim that Reﬂ∗(< κ, κ) holds in V P. To see this, let Q be a κ-directed closed
forcing in V P, let η < κ, and let {Sξ | ξ < η} be a sequence of stationary
subsets of κ in V P∗Q.

Since κ is non-Mahlo, by thinning out the stationary sets if necessary,
we can assume without loss of generality that there is a successor ordinal
i < κ such that η < µi and, for all ξ < η, Sξ ⊆ Sκ
<µi. Let j : V → M be a
κ-supercompact embedding with critical point µi+1.

P can be written as Pi ∗ Col(µi, < µi+1) ∗ Pi+1, where Pi is the ﬁrst i steps
in the iteration and Pi+1 is µi+1-directed closed, so we can write j(P ∗ Q)
as Pi ∗ Col(µi, < j(µi+1)) ∗ j(Pi+1) ∗ j(Q). By standard techniques, if G is
P-generic over V and H is Q-generic over V [G], there is a µi-closed poset R
in V [G][H] such that, if I is R-generic over V [G][H], then, in V [G][H][I],
we can lift j to an elementary embedding j : V [G][H] → M [G][H][I]. Since

µi-closed forcing preserves stationary subsets of Sκ
<µi when κ is inacces-
sible, we have that, for all ξ < η, Sξ is stationary in V [G][H][I]. Since
j“κ ∈ M [G][H][I] and is (< µi)-club in δ = sup(j“κ), we conclude that, for
all ξ < η, M [G][H]i |= “j(Sξ) ∩ δ is stationary in δ.” In particular, since
j({Sξ | ξ < η}) = {j(Sξ) | ξ < η}, M [G][H][I] |= “j({Sξ | ξ < η}) reﬂects
simultaneously.” By elementarity, {Sξ | ξ < η} reﬂects simultaneously in
V [G][H].

4. Consistency results

In this section, we will apply the methods of Section 3 to show that some
of the results from Section 2 are optimal. We start by separating principles
of simultaneous reﬂection of ﬁnitely many stationary sets. In what follows,
I[λ] denotes the approachability ideal on λ. For information on I[λ], we
direct the reader to [3].

Theorem 4.1. Let µ < λ be regular cardinals with λ<λ = λ, and let n be a
natural number. Assume that Reﬂ∗(n, Sλ
µ ∈ I[λ]. Then there is
a generic extension preserving cardinals and coﬁnalities in which Reﬂ(n, Sλ
µ)
holds and Reﬂ(n + 1, Sλ

µ) holds and Sλ

µ) fails.

Proof. Let S be the forcing that adds n + 1 disjoint subsets of Sλ
µ that do not
reﬂect simultaneously using bounded conditions. More precisely, conditions
in S are functions s : (n + 1) × γs → 2 satisfying the following conditions,
where, for i < n + 1, si : γs → 2 is deﬁned by si(α) = s(i, α) and, in a
slight abuse of notation, we will also think of si as the subset of γs whose
characteristic function is si.

(1) γs < λ.
(2) For all i < n + 1, si ⊆ Sλ
µ.
(3) For all i < j < n + 1, si ∩ sj = ∅.
(4) For all ordinals β ≤ γs with cf(β) > ω, there is i < n + 1 such that

si ∩ β is not stationary in β.

If s, t ∈ S, then t ≤ s iﬀ t ⊇ s. Standard arguments show that S is λ-
strategically closed and hence λ-distributive. Let G be S-generic over V ,
and, in V [G], let {Si | i < n + 1} be the generic sets, i.e., for i < n + 1,
Si = Ss∈G si. Clearly, {Si | i < n + 1} does not reﬂect simultaneously. Also,
a simple genericity argument shows that, for every i < n + 1, Si is stationary
in λ. Thus, Reﬂ(n + 1, Sλ

µ ) fails in V [G].

For i < n + 1, let Ti be the forcing that adds a club in λ disjoint from Si.
Conditions of Ti are closed, bounded subsets of λ disjoint from Si, and Ti is
ordered by end-extension. By arguments similar to those found in Section
3, in V , for each i < n + 1, S ∗ ˙Ti contains a dense λ-directed closed subset,
namely the set of (s, ˙t) ∈ S ∗ ˙Ti such that:

(1) there is t ∈ V such that s (cid:13)S “ ˙t = ˇt”;
(2) γs = max(t) + 1.

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

19

Let us work in V [G] and show that Reﬂ(n, Sλ

µ) holds there. Fix n sta-
tionary subsets of Sλ
µ, A0, . . . , An−1. Since {Si | i < n + 1} are pairwise
disjoint, there is i < n + 1 such that, for all j < n, Aj \ Si is stationary in
λ. Otherwise, by the pigeonhole principle, there would be i < i′ < n + 1
and j < n such that Aj \ Si and Aj \ Si′ are both non-stationary and hence
Si ∩ Si′ is stationary. Since, in V , S ∗ ˙Ti has a dense λ-directed closed subset
and Reﬂ∗(n, Sλ
µ) holds
in V [G ∗ H].

µ) holds, if H is Ti-generic over V [G], then Reﬂ(n, Sλ

Claim 4.2. For all j < n, Aj is stationary in V [G ∗ H].

µ ∈ I[λ] in V and S preserves all coﬁnalities, Sλ

Proof. Work in V [G]. Fix j < n, t ∈ Ti, and ˙C, a Ti-name forced by t to be
a club in λ. Since Sλ
µ ∈ I[λ]
in V [G]. In particular, Aj \ Si ∈ I[λ]. Thus, letting θ be a suﬃciently large,
regular cardinal and ⊳ a ﬁxed well-ordering of H(θ), we can ﬁnd an internally
approachable chain hNη | η < µi of elementary substructures of (H(θ), ∈, ⊳)
such that:

(1) Ti, t, ˙C ∈ N0;
(2) for all η < µ, |Nη| < µ;
(3) letting N = Sη<µ Nη and δ = sup(N ∩ λ), we have δ ∈ Aj \ Si.

Since Ti is µ-closed, it is now straightforward to build a decreasing sequence
htξ | ξ < µi of conditions from Ti satisfying the following.

(1) t0 = t;
(2) for all ξ < µ, tξ ∈ Nξ+1;
(3) for all η < µ, sup(Nη ∩ λ) < max(tη+1);
(4) for all η < µ, there is α > sup(Nη ∩ λ) such that tη+1 (cid:13) “ˇα ∈ ˙C.”

Since δ 6∈ Si, we have t∗ := {δ} ∪ Sξ<µ tξ ∈ Ti. Moreover, t∗ forces δ ∈ ˙C; in
particular, t∗ (cid:13)Ti “ ˙C ∩ ˇAj 6= ∅.” Thus, Aj remains stationary in V [G∗H]. (cid:3)

Since Reﬂ(n, Sλ

simultaneously in V [G ∗ H] and hence also in V [G].

µ) holds in V [G ∗ H], we obtain that {Aj | j < n} reﬂects
(cid:3)

Remark 4.3. The assumption that Sλ
µ ∈ I[λ] occurs naturally in many cases.
For example, for any regular, uncountable cardinal λ, Sλ
ω ∈ I[λ]. Also, if λ
is strongly inaccessible, then λ ∈ I[λ] and if λ = µ+ and µ is regular then
Sλ

<µ ∈ I[λ].
In addition, starting with inﬁnitely many supercompact cardinals, iterat-
ing Levy collapses, and then forcing to shoot a club through the set of ap-
proachable points will yield a model in which Reﬂ∗(< κ, Sλ
µ ∈ I[λ]
both hold, where µ < κ, µ is regular, κ is singular, and λ = κ+.

µ) and Sλ

Let us show next that Reﬂ∗(< κ, S) actually implies the indestructibility
of Reﬂ(< κ, S) under a wider class of forcings. This fact will be useful in the
results to follow. We ﬁrst recall the following deﬁnitions.

20

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

Deﬁnition 4.4. Suppose P is a forcing poset, λ is a cardinal such that
λ<λ = λ, and θ is a suﬃciently large regular cardinal. For M ≺ H(θ), let
PM = P ∩ M .

(1) Suppose M ≺ H(θ). A condition p ∈ P is strongly (M, P)-generic
if p forces that GP ∩ M is a PM -generic ﬁlter over V . Equivalently,
every dense, open subset of PM is pre-dense below p in P.

(2) Suppose M ≺ H(θ). M is λ-suitable for P if:

• P ∈ M ;
• |M | = λ;
• <λM ⊆ M .

(3) Let λ be a regular cardinal. P is strongly λ-proper if, whenever
M ≺ H(θ) is λ-suitable for P and p ∈ M ∩ P, there is q ≤ p such
that q is strongly (M, P)-generic.

Theorem 4.5. Suppose λ is a regular cardinal, λ<λ = λ, S ⊆ λ is station-
ary, and κ ≤ λ. Then the following are equivalent:

(1) Reﬂ∗(< κ, S);
(2) Reﬂ(< κ, S) holds in any forcing extension by a λ-directed closed,

strongly λ-proper forcing poset.

Proof. If P is a forcing poset and |P| ≤ λ, then P is trivially strongly λ-
proper, so (2) easily implies (1). Thus, assume Reﬂ∗(< κ, S) holds, and
let P be a λ-directed closed, strongly λ-proper forcing poset. Suppose for
sake of contradiction that there is p ∈ P, µ < κ, and a set of P-names
˙S = { ˙Sη | η < µ} such that p (cid:13)P “ ˙S is a set of stationary subsets of ˇS
that does not reﬂect simultaneously.” We may thus ﬁx a set of P-names
˙C = { ˙Cβ | β ∈ Sλ
>ω, p (cid:13)P “ ˙Cβ is club in β and
there is η < µ such that ˙Cβ ∩ ˙Sη = ∅.”

>ω} such that, for all β ∈ Sλ

Let θ be a suﬃciently large regular cardinal, let ⊳ be a ﬁxed well-ordering
of H(θ), and let M ≺ (H(θ), ∈, ⊳) be λ-suitable for P with p, S, ˙S, ˙C ∈ M .
Let PM = P ∩ M . Since P is λ-directed closed and <λM ⊆ M , PM is a
λ-directed closed forcing of size λ. Thus, since Reﬂ∗(< κ, S) holds, (cid:13)PM
“ Reﬂ(< κ, S).”

>ω, p (cid:13)PM “ ˙Cβ,M is club in ˇβ.”

For η < µ, we may form a PM -name ˙Sη,M for a subset of S such that,
for all α ∈ S and all q ∈ PM , q (cid:13)PM “ˇα ∈ ˙Sη,M ” iﬀ q (cid:13)P “ˇα ∈ ˙Sη”. Let
˙SM = { ˙Sη,M | η < µ}. We may similarly deﬁne PM names ˙Cβ,M for β ∈ Sλ
>ω.
Claim 4.6. For all β ∈ Sλ
Proof. For α < β, let Dα = {q ∈ P | for some α∗ ∈ (α, β), q (cid:13)P “ˇα ∈ ˙Cβ.”}
For limit ordinals γ < β, let Eγ = {q ∈ P | q (cid:13)P “ˇγ ∈ ˙Cβ” or, for some
α < γ, q (cid:13)P “ sup( ˙Cβ ∩ ˇγ) < ˇα.”}. Since p (cid:13)P “ ˙Cβ is club in ˇβ, ” each Dα
and Eγ is dense below p in P. In addition, each Dα and Eγ is in M and
hence, by elementarity, is dense below p in PM . The claim follows.
(cid:3)
>ω, p (cid:13)PM “There is η < ˇµ such that ˙Cβ,M ∩ ˙Sη,M =
Claim 4.7. For all β ∈ Sλ
∅.”

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

21

Proof. Suppose for sake of contradiction that β ∈ Sλ
>ω, q ∈ PM , q ≤ p, and
˙Cβ,M ∩ ˙Sη,M 6= ∅.” Since PM is λ-directed closed and
q (cid:13)PM “For all η < ˇµ,
<λM ⊆ M , we may assume that there is a sequence hαη | η < µi ∈ M such
that, for all η < µ, q (cid:13)PM “ˇαη ∈ ˙Cβ,M ∩ ˙Sη,M .” But then, for all η < µ,
q (cid:13)P “ˇαη ∈ ˙Cβ ∩ ˙Sη, ” contradicting the assumption that p (cid:13)P “There is
η < ˇµ such that ˙Cβ ∩ ˙Sβ = ∅.”
(cid:3)
Therefore, if p (cid:13)PM “ ˙SM is a set of stationary sets, ” then p forces ˙SM to
be a counterexample to Reﬂ(< κ, S), which is a contradiction. Thus, it must
be the case that p (cid:13)PM “For some η < ˇµ,

˙Sη,M is non-stationary.”

Fix η < µ and q ∈ PM such that q ≤ p and q (cid:13)PM “ ˙Sη,M is non-
˙D be a PM -name such that q (cid:13)PM “ ˙D is club in ˇλ and
stationary.” Let
˙D ∩ ˙Sη = ∅.” Find r ∈ P such that r ≤ q and r is strongly (M, P)-generic,
and let G be P-generic over V with r ∈ G.

Then GM := G ∩ M is PM -generic over V and V [GM ] ⊆ V [G]. Note that
˙Sη,M in V [GM ] and of ˙Sη in V [G] are equal. Call this
the interpretations of
interpretation Sη. Since p ∈ G, Sη is a stationary subset of S in V [G] and
˙D in V [GM ]. Since
hence also in V [GM ]. Let D be the interpretation of
q ∈ GM , D is club in λ and D ∩ Sη = ∅, contradicting the fact that Sη is
stationary in V [GM ].
(cid:3)

Let λ<λ = λ, let S = S(λ, 1), and, in V S, let C be the generic (cid:3)(λ)
sequence added by S and T = T(C). In V S, let P be the iteration of length
2λ, taken with supports of size < λ, destroying the stationarity of T-fragile
subsets of λ. For each α < 2λ, let ˙Sα be a Pα-name for the T-fragile subset
of λ destroyed by the αth iterand of P, and let ˙Cα be a Pα ∗ T-name for a
club in λ disjoint from ˙Sα.
Lemma 4.8. S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T is strongly λ-proper.

Proof. Let θ be a suﬃciently large regular cardinal and let M ≺ H(θ) be
λ-suitable for S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T. We claim that the empty condition is strongly
(M, S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T)-generic. To see this, let (s, ˙p, ˙t) ∈ S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T, and let D be a
dense, open subset of (S∗ ˙P∗ ˙T)∩M . By extending (s, ˙p, ˙t) if necessary, we may
suppose that (s, ˙p, ˙t) is in U, the λ-directed closed subset of S∗ ˙P∗ ˙T described
in the proof of Lemma 3.4. Let a ∈ V be such that s (cid:13)S “ dom( ˙p) = ˇa” and,
“ ˙p(α) = ˇcα”. Let t ∈ V
for α ∈ a, let cα ∈ V be such that (s, ˙p ↾ α) (cid:13)S∗ ˙Pα
be such that s (cid:13)S “ ˙t = ˇt.”

Let (s′, ˙p′, ˙t′) ∈ (S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T) ∩ M satisfy the following requirements.
(1) s′ = s and s′ (cid:13)S “ ˙t′ = ˇt.”
(2) s′ (cid:13) “ dom(p′) = ˇa ∩ M.”
(3) For all α ∈ a∩M , ˙p′(α) is forced by s′ to have the following property:
“ˇcα ∩ ˙Sα = ∅, ” then (r, ˙q) (cid:13)S∗ ˙Pα
“ˇcα ∩ ˙Sα 6= ∅, ” then (r, ˙q) (cid:13)S∗ ˙Pα

if (r, ˙q) ∈ S ∗ ˙Pα and (r, ˙q) (cid:13)S∗ ˙Pα
“ ˙p′(α) = ˇcα” and, if (r, ˙q) (cid:13)S∗ ˙Pα
“ ˙p′(α) = ∅.”

22

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

Such an (s′, ˙p′, ˙t′) can be deﬁned, as <λM ⊆ M . Find (s′′, ˙p′′, ˙t′′) ≤ (s′, ˙p′, ˙t′)
in D. It is routine to verify that (s′′, ˙p′′, ˙t′′) and (s, ˙p, ˙t) are compatible in
S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T. This shows that D is pre-dense below the empty condition and
hence that the empty condition is strongly (M, S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T)-generic.
(cid:3)

Note that, by essentially the same proof, Lemma 4.8 remains true if S is
any forcing of the form S(λ, < κ) and T is the associated threading forcing or
if κ < λ is an inﬁnite, regular cardinal, S = Sind(λ, κ), i < κ, and T = Ti(C),
where C is the generic (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence added by S.

Theorem 4.9. Suppose λ is an uncountable, regular cardinal, λ<λ = λ,
S ⊆ λ is stationary, and Reﬂ∗(S) holds. Then there is a forcing extension
preserving all coﬁnalities and cardinalities ≤ λ in which (cid:3)(λ) and Reﬂ(S)
both hold.

Proof. Let S = S(λ, 1). Let G be S-generic over V and, in V [G], let C =
hCα | α < λi be the generically-added (cid:3)(λ) sequence. Let T = T(C), and let
P be an iteration of length 2λ, taken with supports of size < λ, destroying
the stationarity of all T-fragile subsets of S. Let H be P-generic over V [G].
We claim that V [G ∗ H] is the desired model.

We ﬁrst argue that (cid:3)(λ) holds. In fact, C remains a (cid:3)(λ) sequence in
V [G ∗ H]. Work in V [G], and suppose for sake of contradiction that there is
p ∈ H and a P-name ˙t such that p (cid:13)P “ ˙t is a thread through ˇC.” By Lemma
3.4, P has a dense λ-directed closed subset in V [G]T. In particular, P × P
is λ-distributive in V [G], so λ remains regular after forcing with P × P. Let
H0 × H1 be P × P-generic over V [G], with (p, p) ∈ H0 × H1. For i < 2, let
ti be the interpretation of ˙t in V [G ∗ Hi]. By mutual genericity, t0 6= t1. In
V [G ∗ (H0 × H1)], ﬁnd α ∈ acc(t0) ∩ acc(t1) such that t0 ∩ α 6= t1 ∩ α. Then
Cα = t0 ∩ α 6= t1 ∩ α = Cα, which is a contradiction. Thus, C remains a
(cid:3)(λ) sequence in V [G ∗ H].

Next, we show that Reﬂ(S) holds. Let T ∈ V [G ∗ H] be a stationary
subset of S. By our deﬁnition of P, T is not T-fragile, so there is t ∈ T such
that t (cid:13)T “T is stationary.” Let I be T-generic over V [G ∗ H] with t ∈ I.
Since S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T is strongly λ-proper and has a dense λ-directed closed subset,
Reﬂ(S) holds in V [G ∗ H ∗ I]. Thus, T reﬂects in V [G ∗ H ∗ I] so, a fortiori,
T reﬂects in V [G ∗ H] as well.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.10. Suppose λ is an uncountable, regular cardinal, λ<λ = λ,
S ⊆ λ is stationary, and Reﬂ∗(2, S) holds. Then there is a forcing extension
preserving all coﬁnalities and cardinalities ≤ λ in which:

(1) (cid:3)(λ, 2) holds;
(2) for every T ⊆ S such that T and S \ T are both stationary, {T, S \ T }

reﬂects simultaneously.

Proof. Let S = S(λ, 2). Let G be S-generic over V and, in V [G], let C = hCα |
α < λi be the generically added (cid:3)(λ, 2) sequence. Let T = T(C), and let P
be an iteration of length 2λ, taken with supports of size < λ, destroying the

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

23

stationarity of all T-fragile subsets of S. Let H be P-generic over V [G]. We
claim that V [G ∗ H] is the desired model.

We ﬁrst show that C remains a (cid:3)(λ, 2) sequence in V [G ∗ H]. Work in
V [G], and suppose for sake of contradiction that there is p ∈ H and a P-name
˙t such that p (cid:13)P “ ˙t is a thread through C.” By arguments as in the proof of
Theorem 4.9, P3 is λ-distributive in V [G]. Let H0 × H1 × H2 be P3-generic
over V [G] with (p, p, p) ∈ H0×H1×H2. For i < 3, let ti be the interpretation
of ˙t in V [G ∗ Hi]. In V [G ∗ (H0 × H1 × H2)], let α ∈ Ti<3 acc(ti) be such that
t0∩α, t1 ∩α, and t2∩α are pairwise distinct. Then {t0 ∩α, t1∩α, t2 ∩α} ⊆ Cα,
contradicting the fact that |Cα| ≤ 2.

We next show that (2) holds in V [G ∗ H]. First note that, as S ∗ ˙P ∗ ˙T2
has a dense λ-directed closed subset, S remains stationary in V S∗ ˙P∗ ˙T2
. In
V [G ∗ H], let T ⊆ S be such that T and S \ T are both stationary. Let
T0 = T and T1 = S \ T . We ﬁrst claim that there is i < 2 such that (cid:13)T “Ti
is stationary.” To see this, suppose to the contrary that there are t0, t1 ∈ T
such that, for i < 2, ti (cid:13)T “Ti is non-stationary.” Let I0 × I1 be T × T-generic
over V [G ∗ H] with (t0, t1) ∈ I0 × I1. Then, in V [G ∗ H ∗ (I0 × I1)], T0 and
T1 are both non-stationary, contradicting the fact that T0 ∪ T1 = S and S is
stationary.

Without loss of generality, suppose (cid:13)T “T is stationary.” Since S \ T is
not T-fragile, there is t ∈ T such that t (cid:13)T “S \ T is stationary.” Let I be
T-generic over V [G ∗ H] with t ∈ I. In V [G ∗ H ∗ I], T and S \ T are both
stationary and Reﬂ(2, S) holds. Thus, {T, S \ T } reﬂects simultaneously in
V [G ∗ H ∗ I] and hence in V [G ∗ H] as well.
(cid:3)

Theorem 4.11. Suppose λ is an uncountable, regular cardinal, κ < λ is an
inﬁnite, regular cardinal, S ⊆ λ is stationary, and Reﬂ∗(< κ, S) holds. Then
there is a forcing extension preserving all coﬁnalities and cardinalities ≤ λ
in which (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) and Reﬂ(< κ, S) both hold.

Proof. Let S = Sind(λ, κ). Let G be S-generic over V and, in V [G], let C =
hCα,i | α < λ, i(α) ≤ i < κi be the generically-added (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence.
For i < κ, let Ti = Ti(C), and let T = Li<κ Ti.
In V [G], let P be a
forcing iteration of length 2λ, taken with supports of size < λ, destroying
the stationarity of all T-fragile subsets of S. Let H be P-generic over V [G].
We claim that V [G ∗ H] is the desired model.

We ﬁrst show that C remains a (cid:3)ind(λ, κ) sequence in V [G ∗ H]. Work in
V [G] and suppose to the contrary that there is p ∈ H, i < κ, and ˙D such
that p (cid:13)P “ ˙D is a club in ˇλ and, for all α ∈ acc( ˙D),
˙D ∩ α = ˇCα,i.” By
Lemma 3.17, P × P is λ-distributive in V [G]. Let H0 × H1 be P × P-generic
over V [G] with (p, p) ∈ H0 × H1. For i < 2, let Di be the interpretation
˙D in V [G ∗ Hi]. In V [G ∗ (H0 × H1)], ﬁnd α ∈ acc(D0) ∩ acc(D1) such
of
that D0 ∩ α 6= D1 ∩ α. Then Cα,i = D0 ∩ α 6= D1 ∩ α = Cα,i, which is a
contradiction.

YAIR HAYUT AND CHRIS LAMBIE-HANSON

We next show that Reﬂ(< κ, S) holds in V [G ∗ H]. Thus, let µ < κ, and
let {Sη | η < µ} be a family of stationary subsets of S. For all η < µ, Sη is
not T-fragile, so there is iη < κ and tη = Cγη,iη ∈ Tiη such that tη (cid:13)Tiη “ ˇSη is
stationary.” Fix a limit ordinal γ∗ < λ such that sup({γη | η < µ}) < γ∗. Fix
i∗ < κ such that sup({iη | η < µ}) < i∗ and, for all η < µ, γη ∈ acc(Cγ ∗,i∗).
Recall that, for i < i∗, the function πi,i∗ : Ti → Ti∗ sending Cγ,i ∈ Ti
to Cγ,i∗ ∈ Ti∗ is a projection. Thus, for all η < µ, πiη,i∗(tη) (cid:13)Ti∗ “ ˇSη is
stationary.” Let t∗ = Cγ ∗,i∗ and note that t∗ ∈ Ti∗ and, for all η < µ,
t∗ ≤ πiη,i∗(tη). Thus, for all η < µ, t∗ (cid:13)Ti∗ “ ˇSη is stationary.” Let I be
Ti∗-generic over V [G ∗ H] with t∗ ∈ I. Then, in V [G ∗ H ∗ I], Reﬂ(< κ, S)
holds and {Sη | η < µ} is a collection of stationary subsets of S. Thus,
{Sη | η < µ} reﬂects simultaneously in V [G ∗ H ∗ I] and therefore also in
V [G ∗ H].

Examples of results that can be obtained by combining these theorems

with the results from Subsection 3.3 include the following.

Corollary 4.12. Suppose there is a weakly compact cardinal.

(1) There is a forcing extension in which (cid:3)(ℵ2) and Reﬂ(Sℵ2
) both hold.
ℵ0
(2) There is a forcing extension in which (cid:3)(ℵ2, 2) holds and, for all sta-
\ S} reﬂects

\ S is stationary, {S, Sℵ2
ℵ0

such that Sℵ2
ℵ0

tionary S ⊆ Sℵ2
ℵ0
simultaneously.

(3) If i < 2, there is a forcing extension in which (cid:3)ind(ℵ2, ℵi) and Reﬂ(<

ℵi, Sℵ2
ℵ0

) both hold.

Corollary 4.13. Suppose there are inﬁnitely many supercompact cardinals.
(1) There is a forcing extension in which (cid:3)(ℵω+1) and Reﬂ(ℵω+1) both

hold.

(2) There is a forcing extension in which (cid:3)(ℵω+1, 2) holds and, for all
\S is stationary,

such that Sℵω+1

n < ω and all stationary S ⊆ Sℵω+1
{S, S

\ S} reﬂects simultaneously.

ℵn

ℵn

ℵω+1
ℵn

(3) If m < ω, there is a forcing extension in which (cid:3)ind(ℵω+1, ℵm) holds

and, for all n < ω, Reﬂ(< ℵm, Sℵω+1
≤ℵn

) holds.

5. Open questions

Question 1. Let κ < λ be uncountable cardinals, with λ regular, and sup-
pose (cid:3)(λ, < κ) holds. Must it be the case that Reﬂ(< κ, S) fails for every
stationary S ⊆ κ?

A case of particular interest is the following.

Question 2. Can (cid:3)(ω2, ω) and Reﬂ(ℵ0, Sω2
ously?

ω ) consistently hold simultane-

Question 3. Let κ < λ be uncountable cardinals, with λ regular, and suppose
(cid:3)(λ, < κ) holds. Must there be a full (cid:3)(λ, < κ) sequence?

SIMULTANEOUS STATIONARY REFLECTION AND SQUARE SEQUENCES

Note that a positive answer to Question 3 would imply a positive answer

to Question 1 (and hence a negative answer to Question 2).

Question 4. Is there an analogue of Theorem 2.18 dealing with (cid:3)(µ+, < µ)
when µ is singular?
