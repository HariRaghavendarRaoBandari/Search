Abstract

The primordial massive gravitational waves are placed in the squeezed vacuum state
and corresponding BB-mode correlation angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave
background is obtained for various slow roll inﬂation models. The angular power spectrum
is compared with the limit of BICEP2/Keck and Planck joint analysis data and the hybrid
inﬂation model is found favorable.

Introduction

According to the standard model of cosmology, the dark energy accounts for the current ac-
celerating expansion phase of the universe. However, several alternative ideas have also been
proposed to explain this accelerated expansion, and granting mass to graviton is one of them
[1, 2]. The idea of massive graviton was initiated with the linear theory for a non-zero rest mass
particle with spin-2 [3], but endowed with mass, the graviton acquires two additional vector
modes and a scalar mode compared to its massless counterpart. The parameters in the mass
term are carefully tuned, otherwise a sixth degree of freedom with the ghost mode would ap-
pear. In the zero mass limit, all these degrees of freedom due to the mass term are supposed
to decouple and it is expected to recover the general relativistic (GR) case. However, it is
found that the vector modes decouple from the tensor perturbations in the massless limit, while
the scalar mode retains a strong coupling to the trace of stress-energy tensor, thus causing a
discontinuity called the vDVZ discontinuity [4, 5]. The discontinuity problem can be resolved
in the non-linear approach to massive gravity [6]. But it is found that the non-linear theory
reintroduces the ghost mode [7], however the non-linear solutions to this problem are found very
useful [8, 10].

There are several approaches to massive gravity [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In the present work,
we consider a particular model of the massive gravity in which GR is modiﬁed by the Lorentz-
violating mass terms [11, 15, 16], but still maintaining the 3D Euclidean symmetry. This model
is proposed as an analog of the Higgs mechanism in GR where the graviton acquires mass as a
result of spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. The advantage of this theory is that it
is free from the ghost modes, vDVZ discontinuity and at low strong coupling scale. Further, the

vector and scalar modes behave exactly like in GR case and hence the modiﬁcation to gravity
arises only from the two tensor modes whose dispersion relation is massive and relativistic.

The primordial gravitational waves were created during inﬂationary period of the universe
due a mechanism known as parametric ampliﬁcation of the zero-point quantum oscillations
[17, 18]. Hence, the primordial gravitational waves can be placed in a particular quantum state
called squeezed vacuum state [19]. It is possible that the initial vacuum state with no graviton
can be evolved into multi-particle quantum state through the parametric ampliﬁcation process.
Further, the primordial gravitational waves created during the inﬂationary period can also be
ampliﬁed by stimulated emission process thus there is a possibility of existing gravitons with
thermal distribution [20]. Therefore the combined eﬀects of squeezing and thermal features
may be observed for the primordial gravitational waves.
It is believed that the primordial
gravitational waves have left its own signature on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in
the form of a polarization, called the B-mode polarization of CMB [21, 22, 23, 24]. Thus, if the
primordial gravitational waves are considered as massive, then its eﬀect is expected to reﬂect
on the various angular power spectra of CMB (see, for instance [12]) and in particular on the
BB-mode correlation angular power spectrum of CMB [13]. Recently, the angular power spectra
of CMB for the massive primordial gravitational waves are studied without taking into account
of the thermal feature and the existence of these waves in the squeezed vacuum state, but similar
study for the massless counterpart is carried out and are compared with various observational
results of CMB [25, 26]. Hence, in the present work the primordial massive gravitational waves
are placed in the squeezed vacuum state with thermal feature and their eﬀects on the BB-mode
correlation angular power spectrum of CMB for various slow roll inﬂationary models are studied.
The obtained results are compared with the joint analysis data of the BICEP2/Keck Array 150
GHz and Planck 353 GHz maps [27, 28].

2 Massive Gravitational Waves and Power Spectrum

The action for massive gravity is given by [16]

AMG = AEH + AGS

= Z d4x√−g[−m2

plR + Λ4F (Z ij )],

(1)

where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the Einstein-Hilbert action and the second term is the
Goldstone action which leads to the violation of the Lorentz symmetry.
In eq (1), F is an
arbitrary function of the metric components, their derivatives and the Goldstone ﬁelds. Z ij can
be constructed as follows.

Z ij = X βW ij ,
X = Λ−4gµν∂µϕ0∂ν ϕ0,
W ij = Λ−4gµν∂µϕi∂νϕj −
V i = Λ−4gµν∂µϕ0∂ν ϕi,

V iV j

X

,

where β is a constant free parameter, Λ characterizes the cutoﬀ energy scale for low energy
eﬀective theory and ϕ0(x), ϕi(x) are the four scalar ﬁelds.

The vacuum solution corresponding to the ﬂat FLRW metric for the equation (1) is given by

φ0 = Λ2t, φi = Λ2xi,

(2)

2

where ηµν is the ﬂat space metric with the signature -2. The perturbations after the spontaneous
Lorentz symmetry breaking can be written as

gµν = S2ηµν + δgµν ,

(3)

where S is the scale factor and δgµν is the metric perturbation whose components are given by

δg00 = 2S2φ,
δgij = S2(−hij − ∂iQj − ∂jQi + 2(ψδij − ∂i∂jE)).

δg0i = S2(Ni − ∂iB)

(4)
(5)

Here hij is tensor ﬁeld, Ni, Qi are vector ﬁelds and φ, ψ, B, E are scalar ﬁelds.

The Lagrangian for the second-order perturbation can be obtained by expanding √−g + δg, X(g+

δg), V i(g+δg), W ij (g+δg) and F (g+δg) in terms of metric perturbation, then using the unitary
gauge eq.(2) and eq (1) we get

(23)

At the time of horizon re-entry, denoted by ζre, the mass term mgw is dominant for the long
wavelength modes, hence the dispersion relation becomes

The frequency for these modes is less than that at horizon crossing, i.e., k ≪ khc. The time of
re-entry ζre is independent of the momentum and all modes re-enter the horizon simultaneously
when the cosmic expansion rate is comparable to the eﬀective mass of the gravitational waves,

wk ≃ mgw(ζre).

(24)

H(ζre) ≃ mgw(ζre).

Hence, we have ζre ≃ ζhc, are ≃ ahc, Hre ≃ H and whc ≃ mgw(ζhc) = khc

Several attempts have been made to constrain the mass of gravitational waves. For example,
the analysis of coupling between bound galaxy clusters gives an upper bound of the gravitational
wave mass, 2 × 10−62 g (≡ 2.713 × 10−15 Hz) [31]. The analysis of the dynamics of the solar
system estimated the mass of gravitational wave as 7.68 × 10−55 g (≡ 1.0417 × 10−7 Hz) [32].
The observations of stellar-mass compact inspiral and supermassive black hole binary inspiral
have also estimated the upper limit for gravitational wave mass and are respectively given
by 3.678 × 10−62 g (≡ 4.988 × 10−15 Hz) and 3.678 × 10−65 g (≡ 4.988 × 10−18 Hz) [33]. The
observations of the orbital decay of binary pulsars PSR B1913+16 and PSR B1534+12, estimated
the GW mass as 1.4 × 10−52 g (≡ 1.898 × 10−5 Hz) [34]. By considering the arrival times of
gravitational waves and optical light from white dwarf binaries, the gravitational wave mass is
estimated to be less than 10−56 g (≡ 1.356 × 10−9 Hz) [35]. From the cosmological parameters,
the upper limit on the GW mass has been obtained as 4.5 × 10−66 g (≡ 6.10376 × 10−19 Hz)
[36].

3 Massive GWs and BB-mode angular power spectrum of

CMB

Cosmic inﬂation is the most widely known scenario proposed for resolving certain problems and
issues associated with the standard model of cosmology [37, 38]. Several inﬂationary models have
been proposed [39, 40, 41]. It is believed that inﬂation gave rise to density perturbations and
tensor perturbations. Density perturbations seeded the formation of the large scale structures
in the universe and the tensor perturbations represent the gravitational waves which propagate
as ripples in the fabric of space time.

The inﬂaton, a homogeneous scalar ﬁeld, is considered as responsible for cosmic inﬂation in

most models of inﬂation. The equation of motion of the inﬂaton ﬁeld φ is given by

¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V ′ = 0,

(27)

where V is the potential of the inﬂation and H =
determined in terms of the energy density of the inﬂaton ﬁeld

˙S
S is the Hubble parameter, which can be

ρφ =

with the Friedmann equation

H 2 =

3m2

pl (cid:18) 1

˙φ2 + V (φ)(cid:19) .

Under the slow-roll limit,

˙φ2
2 ≪ V , the Hubble parameter can be written as

H 2 ≃

V
3m2

.

(28)

(29)

The slow roll condition is usually characterized by the slow-roll parameters ǫ and η and are
deﬁned as

(30)

Inﬂation persist as long as the slow-roll conditions are satisﬁed, ǫ ≪ 1 and |η| ≪ 1. The tensor
spectral index is related to the slow-roll parameter as

and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is given in terms of the parameter ǫ as [42, 43, 44]

nT ≃ −2ǫ,

PT
PS ≃ 16ǫ,

r ≡

(31)

(32)

its value depends up on the inﬂation model and the above relation with eq.(31) is known as the
consistency relation [45, 46, 47]. In the above expression PT and PS are respectively the power
spectrum of the tensor and scalar perturbations and they can be expressed in terms of inﬂaton
potential as

here k = SH implies that H and V are computed at the time when the mode with wave number
k crosses the horizon. The scalar power spectrum is taken to be PS ≃ 2.43 × 10−9.

The quadratic chaotic inﬂation model can be described with potential for the scalar ﬁeld

given by [48],

V (φ) =

1
2

m2φ2,

(35)

where m is the mass of the scalar ﬁeld. The value of slow-roll parameter for this model is
ǫ = 8.26 × 10−3 and the tensor spectral index is nT ≃ −1.65 × 10−2. The tensor-to-scalar ratio
is r = 0.132.

The quartic chaotic inﬂation model is usually characterized by the potential [49],

V (φ) =

1
4

λφ4,

7

(36)

where λ is the self-coupling of the scalar ﬁeld. The slow roll parameter for this model is ǫ =
1.626 × 10−2 and the tensor spectral index is nT = −3.25 × 10−2. Thus the tensor-to-scalar
ratio is r = 0.26.

The potential for the new inﬂation model is given by

V (φ) =

1
4

λφ4(cid:18)ln

φ
σ0 −

1

4(cid:19) +

λσ4

16

,

(37)

and is known as the Coleman-Weinberg potential [50, 51, 52]. Here λ is the quadratic self-
coupling of the ﬁeld and σ0 is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar ﬁeld at minimum.
The slow roll parameter for this model is ǫ = 1.16 × 10−2 and the tensor spectral index is
nT = −2.32 × 10−2. Hence the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r = 0.186.

The hybrid inﬂation model is a multi-ﬁeld model where inﬂation is driven by two scalar

ﬁelds. The potential for this model is [53, 54],

V (φ) =

1
4λ

(M 2 − λρ2)2 +

1
2

m2φ2 +

1
2

g2φ2ρ2,

(38)

where the φ ﬁeld is responsible for the normal slow-roll inﬂation while the ﬁeld ρ triggers the
end of inﬂation. The parameters g and λ are self-coupling constants of the inﬂaton ﬁeld and the
triggering ﬁeld respectively and m and M are the masses of the ﬁelds. The slow roll parameter
for this model is ǫ = 2.65 × 10−4 and the tensor spectral index is nT = −5.3 × 10−4. The
tensor-to-scalar ratio is r = 4.24 × 10−3.

It is believed that the primordial gravitational waves have left its imprint on the cosmic
microwave background which is to be observed through the B-mode polarization of CMB. Thus
if we consider the primordial gravitational waves as massive then it is expected to have left its
eﬀect on the CMB polarization. Considering the mass limit set up by Ref.[14] for gravitational
wave mass, mgw = 10−66 g (≡ 1.356 × 10−19 Hz), any gravitational wave mass equal to or less
than this mass limit would have indistinguishable eﬀects compared to its massless counterpart.
On the other hand gravitational waves with mass 10−26 cm−1 (≡ 2.997× 10−16 Hz) is expected
to exhibit a signature on the BB-mode correlation angular power spectrum of CMB, especially
at lower multipoles.

The BB-mode correlation angular power spectrum of CMB is given by [23, 55]

(39)

where jl(x) is the spherical Bessel function and g(ζ) = κ e−κ is the probability distribution of
the last scattering with κ as the diﬀerential optical depth for the Thomson scattering.

The tensor power spectrum PT (k) corresponding to each model of inﬂation depends on the
tensor spectral index nT , which varies according to the eﬀective potential of each inﬂation model.
The tensor power spectrum for the massive gravitational waves can be written as

PT (k) = AT (k0)(cid:18) k

k0(cid:19)nT

Z 2(ko).

(40)

where AT (k0) is the normalization constant and Z(ko) is the enhancement factor in terms of
the wavenumber given by eq (25).

The primordial gravitational waves are quantum mechanical in origin [17], during inﬂation,
due to the parametric ampliﬁcation of the zero-point quantum oscillations [19]. Hence, the
massive gravitational waves can also be placed in the squeezed vacuum state and its eﬀect on
the BB mode correlation angular power spectrum of CMB can be studied. The tensor power
spectrum for the massive gravitational waves in the squeezed vacuum state is obtained with help
of the result given in Appendix, and eq (40). Thus, the tensor power spectrum for the massive
gravitational waves in the squeezed vacuum state is obtained as

PT (k) = AT (k0)(cid:18) k

k0(cid:19)nT (cid:20)1 + 2 sinh2 rs + sinh 2rs cos(cid:18)γ +(cid:18)ϑ −

1

2(cid:19) π(cid:19)(cid:21) Z 2(ko).

(41)

Hence, using Refs. [20], [25] and [26] the tensor power spectrum for the massive gravitational

waves in the squeezed vacuum state with thermal eﬀect is obtained as

PT (k) = AT (k0)(cid:18) k

k0(cid:19)nT (cid:20)1 + 2 sinh2 rs + sinh 2rs cos(cid:18)γ +(cid:18)ϑ −

1

2(cid:19) π(cid:19)(cid:21) coth(cid:20) k

2T (cid:21) Z 2(ko). (42)

Next, we obtain the BB-mode correlation angular spectrum of CMB for primordial massive
gravitational waves for quadratic chaotic inﬂation, quartic chaotic inﬂation, new inﬂation and
hybrid inﬂation models with lensed and unlensed eﬀects. The BB mode angular power spectrum
for each inﬂation model is generated using the CAMB code with its corresponding nT value. For
all the cases, the pivot wave number for tensor mode is taken as k0 = 0.002 Mpc−1, for scalar
mode it is k0 = 0.05 Mpc−1 and the optical depth is taken as κ = 0.08. The angular power
spectrum is recomputed for the massive gravitational waves for the aforementioned slow-roll
inﬂationary models for various values of the squeezing parameter and angle with lensed and
unlensed eﬀects for the non-thermal as well as thermal cases.

The obtained BB mode correlation angular power spectra for various inﬂationary modes
for the lensed eﬀect are compared with the joint analysis of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck
data [27, 28]. Note that implemented limit here, that is (BK x BK - α BK x P)/(1 - α)
at α = αf id = 0.04 is computed from the cross-spectra and auto-spectra of the combined
BICEP2/Keck 150 GHz and Planck 353 GHz maps to remove the dust contribution. And BK x
P indicates the cross-spectra of BICEP2/Keck maps at 150 GHz and Planck maps at 353 GHz
and BK x BK indicates the BICEP2/Keck auto-spectra at 150 GHz. (see Ref.[28] for the details
of the implementation of this combination for the limit taken).

The BB-mode correlation angular power spectrum for the massive GWs with mass mgw =
2.9979 × 10−16 Hz for the various slow roll inﬂationary models with unlensed and lensed eﬀects
for various values of squeezing parameter and angle for non-thermal case are given in Figs.1,
3, 5, and 7. The angular power spectrum with unlensed and lensed eﬀects with squeezing and
thermal features for the various inﬂationary models are given in Figs. 2, 4, 6, and 8.

The BB-mode correlation angular power spectrum of the CMB is obtained for the massive
gravitational waves in the squeezed vacuum state for the various slow roll inﬂationary models
with lensing, non-thermal and thermal eﬀects. The corresponding angular spectra are compared
with their massless counter parts as well as the joint analysis of BICEP2/Keck and Planck
data (bottom panels of Figs.1-8). Notice that the angular power spectrum with respect to
the higher multipoles are excluded in current analysis due to contamination from gravitational
lensing eﬀect. It can be seen that the angular power spectrum of massive gravitational waves
exhibits more power, for all the slow roll models of inﬂation under the present work, compared

to their massless counterpart. Thus the BB mode correlation angular power spectrum for the
primordial massive gravitational waves get enhanced due to the squeezing and thermal eﬀects.
From the analysis of the results, it can be observed that the BB-mode angular power spectrum,
for primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed vacuum state and thermal state, for all the
inﬂationary models are out of the limit of the BICEP2/Keck and Planck joint analysis result
except the hybrid inﬂation model (Fig. 9).

4 Conclusion

The BB-mode correlation angular power spectrum of CMB for the primordial massive gravita-
tional waves is studied with squeezing and thermal eﬀects for various slow roll inﬂationary models
and are compared with its massless counterpart and the joint analysis of the BICEP2/Keck and
Planck data.
It can be seen that the angular correlation power spectrum for the primordial
massive gravitational waves for the quadratic, quartic and new inﬂation models are out of the
limit of the joint analysis of the BICEP2/Keck and Planck data. The BB-mode correlation
angular power spectrum for massive gravitational waves in the squeezed vacuum state as well
in thermal state for the hybrid inﬂation model is found with the BICEP2/Keck and Planck
joint analysis data. Thus it may be concluded that the hybrid inﬂation model is most favorable
model in comparison with the other slow roll inﬂationary models under the present study by
considering the primordial massive gravitational waves in squeezed vacuum state with thermal
eﬀect. The present results do not rule out the existence of the primordial massive gravitational
waves in squeezed vacuum and thermal states. Further, the BB mode correlation angular power
spectrum corresponds to massless case can be recovered in absence of the massive gravity.

A Tensor power spectrum in squeezed vacuum state

The squeezed vacuum state is deﬁned as [56, 57]

where Σ(ξ) is the squeezing operator which can be written as

|ξi = Σ(ξ)|0i,

Σ(ξ) = exp(cid:20) 1

ξ∗c2 −

1
2

ξc†2(cid:21) ,

(43)

(44)

where c, c† are respectively the annihilation and creation operators, ξ = rseiγ, rs is the squeezing
parameter with range 0 ≤ rs < ∞ and the squeezing angle γ take values − π

2 ≤ γ ≤ π
2 .

The application of the squeezing operator Σ on the creation and annihilation operators lead

19

to:

c = Σ†(ξ)cΣ(ξ) = c cosh rs − c†eiγ sinh rs,
c† = Σ†(ξ)c†Σ(ξ) = c† cosh rs − ce−iγ sinh rs.

(45)

One can ﬁnds the mean value for the creation and annihilation operators in the vacuum state

and are given by:

h0|ck(ζ)|0i = h0|c†

k(ζ)|0i = 0,

h0|ck(ζ)ck′ (ζ)|0i = uk(ζ)vk′ δ3(k + k′),
h0|c†

k′ δ3(k + k′),
h0|ck(ζ)c†
k′ δ3(k − k′),

k(ζ)vk′ δ3(k − k′).

k′ (ζ)|0i = u∗
k(ζ)v∗
k′ (ζ)|0i = uk(ζ)u∗

k(ζ)ck′ (ζ)|0i = v∗

Where the complex functions uk(ζ) and vk(ζ) are given by

uk = eiθs cosh rs,
vk = e−i(θs−2γ) sinh rs,

here rs, γ and the rotation angle θs are real functions. The equations of motion of these complex
functions are :

The power spectrum for the tensor perturbations can be obtained from the two point correlation
function:

(50)

where PT is called the tensor power spectrum and the angle bracket denotes ensemble average.

The gravitational wave ﬁeld can be written in terms of the mode function and the annihilation

and creation operators, taking the contribution from each polarization to be the same,

h(x, ζ) =

√16πlp

The tensor power spectrum can be expressed in terms of the tensor spectral index, nT , in

squeezed vacuum state, as

PT (k) = AT (k0)(cid:18) k

This can be used to obtain the BB mode correlation angular power spectrum of CMB for

the gravitational waves in the squeezed vacuum state.
