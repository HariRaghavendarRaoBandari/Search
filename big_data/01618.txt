Signatures of Gravitational Instability in Resolved Images of

Protostellar Disks

Hauyu Baobab Liu6,8

ABSTRACT

Protostellar (class 0/I) disks, having masses comparable to those of their
nascent host stars, and fed continuously from their natal infalling envelopes, are
prone to gravitational instability (GI). Motivated by advances in near-infrared
(NIR) adaptive optics imaging and mm-wave interferometry, we explore the ob-
servational signatures of GI in disks, using hydrodynamical and Monte Carlo
radiative transfer simulations to synthesize NIR scattered light images and mm
dust continuum maps. Spiral arms induced by GI, located at disk radii of hun-
dreds of AUs, are local overdensities and have their photospheres displaced to
higher altitudes above the disk midplane; arms therefore scatter more NIR light
from their central stars than inter-arm regions, and are detectable at distances
up to 1 kpc by Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE, and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO. By
contrast, collapsed clumps formed by disk fragmentation have such strong local
gravitational ﬁelds that their scattering photospheres are at lower altitudes; such
fragments appear fainter than their surroundings in the NIR. Spiral arms and
streamers recently imaged in four FU Ori systems at NIR wavelengths resemble
GI-induced structures and support the interpretation that FUors are gravitation-
ally unstable protostellar disks. At mm wavelengths, both spirals and clumps
appear brighter in thermal emission than the ambient disk and can be detected

Introduction

Both stellar and substellar companions can be spawned within gaseous accretion disks
around newly born stars. At early times, the mass of the disk can be signiﬁcant compared
with the still-forming central star, and the mass infall rate from the disk’s natal envelope can
be larger than the accretion rate through the disk. Such young and unsteady disks experience
gravitational instability (GI) if they satisfy the Q criterion (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965):

Q =

csΩ
πGΣ

(cid:46) unity,

(1)

where cs, Ω, and Σ are the disk’s sound speed, orbital frequency, and surface density. Gravi-
tationally unstable disks have been simulated extensively (e.g., Vorobyov & Basu 2005, 2006,
2010b; Boley et al. 2010; Machida et al. 2011b; Tsukamoto et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2012a).
The disks may also fragment if they cool suﬃciently fast (e.g., Gammie 2001; Rice et al.
2003; Raﬁkov 2009; Shi & Chiang 2014):

β = tcoolΩ (cid:46) a few,

(2)

where tcool is the cooling timescale. Disk fragmentation can result in bound self-gravitating
objects, and is thought to be a channel for the formation of giant planets, brown dwarfs, or
stars.

We can enumerate a number of observational consequences of GI in protostellar/protoplanetary

disks:

1. GI excites large-scale spiral arms, which may be visible in resolved observations at
near-infrared (NIR; e.g., Dong et al. 2015a; Pohl et al. 2015) and mm wavelengths
(e.g., Cossins et al. 2010; Vorobyov et al. 2013; Dipierro et al. 2014).

2. At large orbital distances from the star, disk fragmentation may form bound objects
such as giant planets, brown dwarfs, or stellar mass companions (e.g., Boss 1997;

– 3 –

Rice et al. 2005; Raﬁkov 2005; Stamatellos & Whitworth 2009; Kratter et al. 2010;
Meru & Bate 2011; Machida et al. 2011b; Vorobyov & Basu 2010a; Vorobyov 2013).
These objects, or their circumsecondary disks (e.g., Kraus et al. 2015; Caceres et al.
2015), may be detectable by adaptive optics (AO) imaging (e.g., Kraus & Ireland 2012;
Bowler et al. 2013; Kuzuhara et al. 2013).

3. GI (possibly in combination with other disk instabilities such as the magnetorotational
instability) can trigger outbursts (e.g., Vorobyov & Basu 2005, 2006, 2010b; Zhu et al.
2009; Machida et al. 2011b; Bae et al. 2014; Vorobyov & Basu 2015), detectable as
abrupt and possibly repetitive surges in the accretion luminosity. The accretion out-
bursts in FU Orionis objects (FUor; Hartmann et al. 1998; Audard et al. 2014) and in
some EX Orionis objects (EXor; Herbig 2008) have been suggested to be triggered by
GI.

4. The gas kinematics in self-gravitating disks deviates from Keplerian. These deviations

may be detectable in molecular line observations (e.g., Rosenfeld et al. 2014).

Historically, program 1 — resolved imaging — has been diﬃcult to pursue. Young
disks are often embedded in and highly extincted by gaseous envelopes at optical to NIR
wavelengths. FUors and EXors are rare and typically found in distant clusters of young
stellar objects (e.g., Orion at ∼400 pc). To resolve GI-induced spiral arms and fragments
at these distances demands 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) or better angular resolution, and sub-arcsec inner working
angles. Observations of possibly GI-unstable class 0/I objects (Andre & Montmerle 1994)
have so far been mostly indirect/photometric.

The situation, however, has been recently evolving, thanks to technological advances in
both NIR direct imaging and mm-wave interferometry. At NIR wavelengths, a ﬂeet of new in-
struments equipped with extreme adaptive optics and polarimetric diﬀerential imaging (PDI;
e.g., Perrin et al. 2004; Hinkley et al. 2009) has been deployed, including VLT/SPHERE
(Beuzit et al. 2008), Gemini/GPI (Macintosh et al. 2008), and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO
(Jovanovic et al. 2015). At mm wavelengths, the new interferometers ALMA and JVLA are
probing young stellar objects with unprecedentedly high sensitivity and resolution. Liu et al.
(2016b) directly imaged four FUors using Subaru/HiCIAO with sub-0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) angular resolution:
FU Ori, V1735 Cyg, V1057 Cyg, and Z CMa (see also the VLT/NaCo observation of Z CMa
by Canovas et al. 2015). Polarization vector analysis conﬁrmed that these objects contain
disks. Large-scale asymmetric structures such as spirals and streamers, possibly produced
by GI, were discerned at stellocentric distances of hundreds of AU. With its sub-0.05(cid:48)(cid:48) resolu-
tion, ALMA resolved the class 0/I disk HL Tau (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015), which has
an estimated mass of (cid:38) 0.1M(cid:12) ((cid:38) 0.2 times the mass of its central star M(cid:63); Greaves et al.

– 4 –

2008; Kwon et al. 2011) and whose self-gravity may be signiﬁcant (Takahashi & Inutsuka
2014; Jin et al. 2016).

Looking ahead, we anticipate a great many images of class 0/I disks to become avail-
able at high angular resolution in the next decade. These new data will help to answer
key questions in disk evolution and planet formation: How long is the GI-unstable phase?
Do companions form through disk fragmentation? What are the nature of FUor and EXor
outbursts? Motivated by these upcoming observations, in this paper we synthesize images
of gravitationally unstable protostellar/protoplanetary disks at early times (cid:46) 0.5 Myr, when
infall from the envelope is still occurring. We employ the Vorobyov & Basu (2015) hydro-
dynamics code to simulate the formation and evolution of a disk-star system directly from
the collapse of a rotating, initially starless cloud core. The results of the hydro code are
fed into the Whitney et al. (2013) Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code to produce
synthetic images of the disk. We focus on direct imaging of the NIR polarized intensity
(PI), and on interferometric maps of the mm-wave dust thermal emission. The goal is to
make predictions for future resolved observations, and in particular to answer the question
of whether GI-induced spiral arms and fragments are detectable in NIR imaging observa-
tions using Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE, and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO, and in mm dust
continuum observations using ALMA.

Some groundwork on synthesizing images has been laid. Vorobyov et al. (2013) carried
out semianalytic calculations to create mock ALMA observations of GI-unstable disks. They
did not examine the properties of the disk in scattered light, nor did they consider non-face-
on viewing angles. These limitations are removed in our work. Stamatellos et al. (2011)
simulated ALMA observations of GI-unstable disks produced by their smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code. We relax their assumptions that dust has a constant temperature and
is optically thin. The appearance of GI-induced spiral arms and clumps has been studied by
Cossins et al. (2010), Douglas et al. (2013) and Mayer et al. (2016) at mm wavelengths and
by Dong et al. (2015a) at NIR wavelengths; these works focused on isolated systems (i.e.,
those without infalling envelopes) and on small scales (∼100 AU); moreover, the systems
were only evolved for a few tens of thousand years or less.

The structure of our paper is as follows. We introduce our hydrodynamics simulation in
Section 2.1 and our MCRT simulations in Section 2.2. The results of the hydro simulation
are presented in Section 3.1, and synthetic images are shown in NIR scattered light in
Section 3.2 and in the mm-wave thermal continuum in Section 3.3. In Section 4.1 we discuss
the limitations of our models, and in Section 4.2 we review the near-term prospects for
observing GI-unstable young disks. Section 5 summarizes.

2. Simulations

We carry out a 2+1D hydrodynamics simulation to model the formation and evolution
of a disk-star system directly from the collapse of an initially starless, rotating molecular
cloud core. The hydro code (Section 2.1) is adopted largely from Vorobyov & Basu (2015)
with a few improvements as described below. The gas surface density is calculated from
the hydro simulation at 6 epochs. For insertion into the Whitney et al. (2013) MCRT code
(Section 2.2), the 2D surface density from the hydro model is “puﬀed up” vertically into
a 3D density ﬁeld by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, using an approximate temperature
and vertical scale height inferred from the hydro model. The MCRT code produces both
scattered light and thermal emission maps; the latter are computed from dust temperatures
calculated in detail from the MCRT model.

2.1. Hydrodynamical Simulation

We start our numerical simulation from the gravitational collapse of a starless cloud core,
continue into the embedded phase of star formation — during which a star, disk, and envelope
are formed — and terminate our simulations at t ∼ 0.5 Myr when the envelope dissipates
after accreting onto the star+disk system. Long integration times are made possible by
the use of the thin-disk (2D) approximation. This approximation enables us to follow the
evolution of the disk for many orbital periods and its justiﬁcation is discussed in Vorobyov
& Basu (2010b). Once formed, the protostellar disk occupies the inner part of the numerical
polar grid (usually, several hundreds of AU), while the contracting envelope occupies the
rest of the grid (which may extend to several thousands of AU).

To avoid time steps that are too short, we introduce a “sink cell” at rsc = 10.0 AU
and impose a free outﬂow boundary condition so that matter is allowed to ﬂow out of
the computational domain but is prevented from ﬂowing in. During the early stages of
core collapse, we monitor the gas surface density in the sink cell; when its value exceeds
a critical value for the transition from isothermal to adiabatic evolution, we introduce a
ﬁrst hydrostatic core (FHSC) with a size equal to that of the sink cell. The parameters of
the FHSC are calculated assuming a simple polytropic sphere model with index n = 2.5
(γ = 7/5). When the temperature in the center of the FHSC exceeds 2000 K (triggering the
dissociation of molecular hydrogen) or its mass exceeds 0.05 M(cid:12) (as suggested by radiation
transfer calculations of Masunaga & Inutsuka 2000), we assume that the second collapse
ensues and a central protostar forms. In the subsequent evolution, 90% of the gas that crosses
the inner boundary is assumed to land on the protostar. The other 10% of the accreted gas
is assumed to be carried away by protostellar jets. The FHSC stage is usually short (tens of

– 6 –

thousands of years) compared to the protostellar stage (several hundred thousand years).

where subscripts p and p(cid:48) refers to the planar components (r, φ) in polar coordinates, Σ is the

gas pressure calculated via the ideal equation of state as P = (γ − 1)e, vp = vrˆr + vφ
ˆφ
is the velocity in the disk plane, and ∇p = ˆr∂/∂r + ˆφr−1∂/∂φ. Turbulent viscosity is
taken into account via the viscous stress tensor Π, the expression for which is provided in
Vorobyov & Basu (2010b). We parameterize the magnitude of kinematic viscosity ν using
the α-prescription with a spatially and temporally uniform α = 0.01. The ratio of speciﬁc
heats is calculated by assuming that γ = 5/3 below 100 K and γ = 7/5 above 100 K. We
apply a smooth transition at the critical temperature to avoid sharp changes in the values
of γ. This form of γ takes into account the fact that the rotational and vibrational degrees
of freedom of molecular hydrogen are excited only above 100 K.

The gravitational acceleration in the disk plane, gp = grˆr + gφ

ˆφ, takes into account the
self-gravity of the disk and the gravity of the central protostar when formed. The former
component is found by solving for the Poisson integral

where rout is the radial position of the computational outer boundary (equivalently, the initial
radius of the cloud core). This integral is calculated using a FFT technique which applies the
2D Fourier convolution theorem for polar coordinates (see Binney & Tremaine 1987, Sect.
2.8).

An approximate expression for the radially and azimuthally varying vertical scale height
h is determined in each computational cell via the equation of local vertical pressure balance

where Tbg is the uniform background temperature (set to the initial temperature of the natal

absorbed by the disk surface from the central star. The latter quantity is calculated as

Firr(r) =

L∗
4πr2 cos γirr,

(15)

where γirr is the incidence angle of radiation arriving at the disk surface (with respect to
the normal). The incidence angle is calculated using the disk vertical scale height h, as
described in Vorobyov & Basu (2010b); disk self-shielding is not taken into account in the
present study.

The stellar luminosity L∗ is the sum of the accretion luminosity L∗,accr = (1−)GM∗ ˙M /2R∗
arising from the gravitational energy of accreted gas and the photospheric luminosity L∗,ph
due to gravitational contraction and deuterium burning in the stellar interior. The stellar
˙M are determined from the amount of gas passing
mass M∗ and accretion rate onto the star
into the sink cell. The properties of the forming protostar (L∗,ph and radius R∗) are calculated
using the Lyon stellar evolution code described in Baraﬀe & Chabrier (2010). As in Baraﬀe
et al. (2012), we assume that a fraction  of the accretion energy GM∗ ˙M /(2R∗) is absorbed
by the protostar, while the remaining fraction (1 − ) is radiated away and contributes to
the accretion luminosity of the star L∗,accr. Despite many eﬀorts, the exact value of  in
low-mass star formation is not known.
In the present calculations, we adopt a so-called
“hybrid” scheme (for details, see Baraﬀe et al. 2012) with  = 0 when accretion rates remain
smaller than a critical value ˙Mcr = 10−5 M(cid:12) yr−1, and  = 0.2 when ˙M > ˙Mcr. The stellar
evolution code is coupled with the main hydrodynamical code in real time. Because of the
heavy computational load, the stellar evolution code updates the properties of the protostar
only every 20 yr, while the hydrodynamical time step may be as short as a few months.

Equations (3)–(5) are solved in polar coordinates on a numerical grid with 512 × 512
grid zones. The radial grid zones are logarithmically spaced, while the grid spacing in the
azimuthal direction is uniform. The details of the solution procedure are given in Vorobyov
& Basu (2010b). For initial conditions, we considered a gravitationally unstable pre-stellar

region of size r0 = 2400 AU which transitions to an r−1 proﬁle; they are representative of
a wide class of observations and theoretical models (Basu 1997; Andre et al. 1993; Dapp &
Basu 2009). The initial radius of the core is 0.07 pc and its initial temperature is uniform
at 10 K. The total mass of the core is 1.08 M(cid:12).

2.2. Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer Simulations

The MCRT simulations largely follow the procedures in Dong et al. (2015b), and are
summarized below. We construct a 3D grid in the radial (r), azimuthal (φ), and polar
(θ) directions. The grid covers from the dust sublimation radius rsub to an outer radius
rout = 1000 AU, 0 − 2π in φ, and 0 − π in θ (θ = π/2 is the disk midplane), and has
419× 512× 200 cells in r× φ× θ. At r ≥ rin the r× φ grid is identical to the polar grid in the
hydro model, while from rsub ≤ r < rin (a region not covered by the hydro model) the grid
is logarithmic in r. The sublimation radius rsub is determined for each epoch of the hydro
model as where the dust temperature reaches 1600 K (rsub ∼ 0.1 AU). The grid spacing δθ
is linearly proportional to θ to better resolve the disk midplane. At 1000 ≥ r(AU) ≥ 20,
Σgas is set by the hydro model; at 20 AU ≥ r ≥ rsub, Σgas follows a 1/r radial proﬁle. We
note that the envelope at r > 1000 AU in the hydro simulation is not included in the MCRT
calculations; this omission will be discussed in Section 4.2. To construct 3D disk models
from 2D hydro Σgas maps, we assume hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction z, and
puﬀ up the 2D disk according to a Gaussian proﬁle,

ρgas(z) =

√
Σgas
2π
h

e−z2/2h2,

(18)

where ρgas is the gas volume density and the scale height h is computed from the hydro
simulation (Equation 11). The central star in MCRT simulations has the same temperature,
mass, and luminosity (photospheric+accretion) as determined in the hydro simulation at
each epoch (Table 1). All simulations are run with at least 2 billion photon packets.

Millimeter observations have shown evidence of grain growth in class 0/I objects. For
example, the ∼1 Myr old HL Tau disk is very bright at mm wavelengths, indicating the
presence of large grains (ALMA Partnership et al. 2015). Also, Miotello et al. (2014) and
Chiang et al. (2012) found low values of the mm spectral index in class I objects. To take grain
growth into account, we include two populations of dust grains in the MCRT simulations:
small and big grains. Small grains are standard interstellar medium (ISM) grains (Kim
et al. 1994) made of silicate, graphite, and amorphous carbon. Their size distribution obeys
a power law in the size range of 0.02 (cid:46) s (cid:46) 0.25 µm, followed by an exponential cut oﬀ at
larger sizes. Big grains have identical composition, but have grown to a maximum size of
1 mm with a power law size distribution dn(s)/ds ∝ s−3. The optical properties of both
populations can be found in Figure 2 of Dong et al. (2012). The opacity of the big grains is
13 cm2 g−1 at 1.3 mm (dust only, not dust+gas). The scattering phase function of the small
grains is approximated using the Henyey & Greenstein (1941) function, and a Rayleigh-like
phase function is assumed for the linear polarization (White 1979).

Dust grains dominate the opacity in disks. Speciﬁcally, NIR scattered light arises from
the disk surface, and mainly probes the distribution of small grains (both their surface
density and vertical distribution). Mm continuum emission is sensitive to the surface den-
sity distribution of big grains. To convert ρgas into ρgrains, we assume a total dust-to-gas
mass density ratio of 1:100 and a small-to-big dust mass density ratio of 1:9. We as-
sign ρsmall grains = 10−3ρgas (small grains are well-mixed with gas). For the big grains, we
take Σbig grains = 9 × 10−3Σgas and distribute them vertically according to a Gaussian with
scale height hbig grains = 0.5h to mimic vertical settling. We note that the speciﬁc ratio of
hbig grains/h is not important as long as it is less than 1; the NIR scattered light is more
sensitive to the small grains, and the mm continuum emission is not sensitive to the vertical
distribution of the big grains.

Full resolution synthesized PI images at λ = 1.6 µm (H-band) and mm continuum maps
at 1.3 mm (230 GHz; ALMA band 6) and 0.87 mm (345 GHz; ALMA band 7) are produced
from the MCRT simulations.1 Full resolution H-band images are then convolved by a Gaus-
sian PSF with a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 0.04(cid:48)(cid:48), to simulate the diﬀraction
limited angular resolution of Subaru, VLT, and Gemini. Full resolution mm images are
transformed to simulated ALMA observations using the simobserve and simanalyze tools
under Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA). A full array of 50 12-meter an-
tennas is used.2 Throughout the paper, we use a blue-hot color scheme at H-band and a

3. Results

In this section, we examine the outcomes from both the hydro and MCRT simulations.
The general evolution of the disk, the behavior of episodic accretion, and the formation and
properties of fragments in the hydro simulations have been explored extensively in the series
of papers by Vorobyov et al. In this work we focus on the visibility of GI-induced fragments
and spiral arms in resolved images. To reiterate some of the global model parameters from
Section 2.1, the initial radius of the core is 0.07 pc, its total mass is 1.08M(cid:12), and the ratio
of its initial rotational energy to its gravitational potential energy is 0.68%.

3.1. Hydro Models

Figure 1 shows Σgas at t = 0.12, 0.19, 0.23, 0.28, 0.34, and 0.43 Myr in the hydro
simulation. Time here is counted from the formation of the protostar (and not from the
onset of molecular cloud collapse). A rotating disk component emerges around the protostar
at ∼0.016 Myr. The disk mass grows from 0.13M(cid:12) at t=0.12 Myr to 0.18M(cid:12) at t=0.32 Myr;
at the meantime the stellar mass increases from 0.37M(cid:12) to 0.61M(cid:12) (the disk-to-star mass
ratio gradually declines with time). Soon after the disk forms, it undergoes GI as driven by
ongoing mass loading from the infalling envelope, and fragments. The disk radius increases
from ∼300 AU at ∼0.1 Myr to a maximum of ∼700 AU at ∼0.3 Myr, and afterwards shrinks.
At the 6 epochs, 3–7 fragments are present at stellocentric distances between 100–600 AU.
The fragments are generally smaller than 40 AU (0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) at 400 pc), and are characterized by
surface densities of ∼50–2000 g cm−2. Spiral arms and lobes are present at all epochs. These
structures are located at hundreds of AUs from their central stars, and can often extend over
π in the azimuthal direction. The surface density Σgas of the arms is usually 2.5–20× higher
than the azimuthal average of the background disk at the same radius.

Figures 2 and 3 show Thydro and h/r from the hydro simulation. As derived in Section 2.1,
h follows from gravity (from both the central star and disk) balancing pressure P in the
vertical direction, where P is set by the hydro disk temperature Thydro. Azimuthally averaged
Thydro vary from ∼ 80 K at 10 AU to ∼ 30 K at 100 AU. In high density regions such as spiral

arms and fragments, Thydro increases to up to 230 k because P dV work is done to compress
the gas, increasing h. On the other hand, in these same overdensities, the local gravity is
stronger, decreasing h. Our results show that the latter eﬀect dominates the former so that
h decreases in high density regions. In most spiral arms, h drops by (cid:46) 20%. Such a drop
does not necessarily imply that the NIR scattering surface is lower inside arms than outside
arms; we will ﬁnd in Section 3.2 that the scattering surface is actually higher inside the arms
because they contain more material. In fragments, the collapse of the local scale height is
more dramatic: h drops by factors of 3–30.

3.2. NIR Images

Full resolution and convolved H-band PI images of disks at a distance of 400 pc are
shown in Figure 4 for all 6 epochs and 2 viewing angles (face-on and 45◦ inclination). A
detailed comparison between these images at t = 0.34 Myr and the raw Σ image is made in
Figure 5. At all epochs the disk is bright and shows complicated structures. We note that
the current detection limit (noise level) in NIR PI imaging observations lies at about 0.1
mJy arcsec−2, if not lower (e.g., Hashimoto et al. 2012; Mayama et al. 2012; Kusakabe et al.
2012; Grady et al. 2013; Follette et al. 2013).3 This corresponds to the transition between
blue (undetectable) and red (detectable) in our NIR color scheme. Our assumed angular
resolution (0.04(cid:48)(cid:48)) is small enough to resolve most spiral arms. As a result, the convolved
images are quite similar to the full resolution images.

Most spiral arms appear as prominent bright features, while all fragments appear as
depressions in surface brightness (see the 6 fragments marked in Figure 5). These brightness
variations are caused by variations in the height of the scattering photosphere, deﬁned as
the surface where the optical depth τ(cid:63) to the star is 1. This τ(cid:63) = 1 surface is determined by
Σ and h. As shown in Juh´asz et al. (2015), a change in h of at least 20% is required for a
structure to be visible in current NIR observations. In our simulated spiral arms, the drop
in h due to self-gravity is generally (cid:46) 20% and therefore insigniﬁcant;4 thus, the increase in
surface density within the arms pushes the local τ(cid:63) = 1 surface higher than the surrounding
background. Spirals arms are therefore illuminated by the star and appear brighter. By
contrast, in fragments, the drop in h due to self-gravity is so signiﬁcant that these regions

30.1 mJy arcsec−2 is the detection limit for AO188+HiCIAO onboard Subaru. Detection limits for the

newer generation of instruments, such as Gemini/GPI and VLT/SPHERE, are expected to be better.

4There are a few, extremely dense spiral arms for which the depression in h is severe; an example is

indicated by the arrow in Figure 3.

– 13 –

are shadowed and appear as holes in NIR images.

Figure 5 also demonstrates the eﬀect of increasing the distance to the object to 1 kpc
(roughly the distance to FUors V1735 Cyg and Z CMa). The major spirals at r (cid:38) 200 AU
remain visible as their physical sizes (in particular their widths) are comparable to the
resolution.

The spiral arms appear similar when viewed face-on or at 45◦ inclination (see the right
two columns of Figure 4). The edge of the nearside of the disk (the bottom side) is not
always parallel to the (horizontal) major axis because of variations in disk surface density
and scale height. At 0.28 Myr the disk is so asymmetric that even when viewed face-on, it
appears nearly one-sided.

3.3. Millimeter Images

Figure 6 shows full resolution MCRT dust continuum images and simulated ALMA
images at 1.3 mm (230 GHz; ALMA band 6). Full resolution images closely trace the
surface density at all 6 epochs. Figure 7 provides a closer look at 0.34 Myr, at which time
all 6 fragments and major spiral arms identiﬁed in Σ (panel a) are clearly visible in the full
resolution image (panel b). By contrast to the NIR, both spiral arms and fragments in the
thermal continuum appear as local maxima, despite the fact that the surface temperatures
of the fragments are lower than their surroundings because they are shadowed. Fragments
appear bright in the mm because they are optically thick, whereas the ambient disk is
optically thin, with vertical optical depths (cid:46) 0.05.

The simulated ALMA images in Figure 6 are produced with array conﬁguration #19
and integration times of 1 hour. The 3σ detection limit is 34 µJy beam−1 as calculated
by the ALMA sensitivity calculator;5 in our color scheme this noise ﬂoor corresponds to
the transition between black (undetected) and red (detected). The synthetic beam size is
∼0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) (40 AU at 400 pc).6 Evidently, 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) angular resolution is suﬃcient to resolve most
fragments and spiral arms at 400 pc. This can be further illustrated by comparing panels
(a) and (e) in Figure 7. Among the 6 fragments in (a), F1, F2, F3, and F6 are clearly visible
and distinguishable in (e), while F4 and F5 may be diﬃcult to separate because of their

umn density, Tsky, and Tsys are adopted.

small separation (∼50 AU). The sensitivity is suﬃcient to detect emission from all major
structures out to hundreds of AUs. Figure 8 shows the signiﬁcance of detections for face-on
ALMA images in Figure 6. The masses of fragments, determined using the fragment tracking
algorithm of Vorobyov (2013), are 33, 1.0, 2.7, 2.7, 1.9, and 2.5 MJ, respectively (note that
F2 is likely still in the process of formation and will continue growing in the subsequent
evolution). All fragments are signiﬁcantly detected in (c) by at least 40σ, even for the lowest
mass fragment F2 of 1MJ (also the lowest mass fragment among all epochs). Spiral arms are
generally detected at (cid:38) 10σ except in the outer regions beyond ∼700 AU. Simulated ALMA
observations using the parameters underlying Figure 6 recover > 70% of the total mm ﬂux
density, as listed in Table 1. These conclusions are consistent with those of Vorobyov et al.
(2013).

The angular resolution and the total integration time are two key parameters in ALMA
observations. Figure 7 illustrates the eﬀects of varying these two parameters. Panels (c) and
(e) demonstrate the diﬀerence between an integration time of 10 minutes (c) and 60 minutes
(e), while the resolution is ﬁxed at 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48). Since the sensitivity is inversely proportional to
√
integration time, the noise level in (c) is 2.4 times higher than in (e). The uv sampling of
the 10-minute snapshot observation is less complete, and thus side lobes are more prominent
in (c). Nevertheless, qualitatively the two panels are quite similar to each other. Fragments
F1, F2, F3, F4+F5, and F6 are all signiﬁcantly detected in (c), with the the least massive
fragment F2 (1 MJ) detected at 17σ. Most spiral arms are also visible in (c), though some
are only marginally detected.

Panels (d), (e), and (f) demonstrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent angular resolutions, achieved
by varying the array conﬁguration: (d) has an angular resolution of 0.22(cid:48)(cid:48) (88 AU at 400 pc,
or 2.2 times larger than (e)), while (f) has an angular resolution of 0.06(cid:48)(cid:48) (24 AU at 400 pc,
or 40% smaller than (e)).7 The integration time is ﬁxed (1 hour) so that their sensitivities
are the same in units of mJy beam−1. The impact of angular resolution is dramatic. In (d),
F4, F5, and F6 merge into a larger clump, and F3 is absorbed into the central peak. Spiral
arms that are close together also merge to form larger (wider) arms. In (f), although all 6
fragments are resolved by the small beam, their detection signiﬁcance drops: the weakest
source F2 is now a 10σ detection. At small angular resolution, large-scale structures, such
as most spiral arms, are severely resolved out and not visible. As a result, (f) only recovers
about 40% of the total ﬂux density in the original full resolution image, while (d) recovers
90% and (e) recovers 72% of the total ﬂux density.

4. Discussion

4.1. Limitations of Our Models

4.1.1. Gas-Dust Decoupling

Grains in disks are subject to both gravity and gas drag (e.g., Weidenschilling 1977;

Birnstiel et al. 2010). Particles with dimensionless stopping times (a.k.a. Stokes numbers)

τs =

πsρbulk
2Σgas

(19)

approaching unity drift the most quickly toward gas pressure maxima (e.g., Rice et al. 2006;
Zhu et al. 2012b). Here ρbulk ∼ 1 g/cm3 is the internal bulk density of a grain, and s is the
grain size. In our models, big grains with sizes s ∼ 1 mm at r (cid:38) 300 AU can have τs ∼ 1
in low-density inter-arm regions. As a result, our models may be overestimating the surface
density of the big grains in low density regions at large distances, as big grains may actually
be accumulating in high pressure regions such as spiral arms and fragments. Consequently,
we may be underestimating the contrast of the arms and fragments at r (cid:38) 300 AU in mm
images relative to the surrounding background. Nevertheless, fragments and spiral arms
are already detected with high signiﬁcance in our simulated ALMA images, even without
this further concentration; properly taking this eﬀect into account can only enhance their
visibilities.

4.1.2. Thydro vs. TMCRT

There are two versions of disk temperature in our models. The temperature from our
hydro code, Thydro, takes into account both radiation from the central star and hydrody-
namical processes such as P dV work, viscous and shock heating, and is computed assuming
the radiation ﬁeld is diﬀusive (Appendix). On the other hand, the MCRT simulation cal-
culates its own temperature, TMCRT, which takes into account scattering, absorption, and
re-emission of starlight in 3D, but does not include hydrodynamical processes. We expect
TMCRT to be more accurate than Thydro, everywhere except in regions where hydrodynamical
processes are signiﬁcant, such as inside fragments.

– 16 –

Figure 10 compares the midplane temperatures calculated by the two methods at 0.34
Myr. For the most part, except in fragments, Thydro is lower than TMCRT by (cid:46) 40%. Since
h ∝ √
T , the inaccuracy in h as propagated from Thydro is expected to be (cid:46) 20%. This is
not a major source of error; Juh´asz et al. (2015) found that abrupt changes in h of (cid:38) 20%
are needed to generate discernible eﬀects in current NIR direct imaging observations.

More serious is the discrepancy between temperatures calculated within dense frag-
ments.
In fragment centers, Thydro can exceed TMCRT by up to one order of magnitude
(Figure 10). The mm-wave thermal ﬂuxes of fragments may therefore be underestimated by
our MCRT simulations (the NIR images are more reliable insofar as they depend on vertical
scale heights calculated from the more realistic hydro simulation). To assess the error in
the mm-wave images, we re-calculate the mm ﬂuxes by inserting the Thydro data into the
3D ray-tracing module of the NATALY radiative transfer code described in Pavlyuchenkov
et al. (2011). In these ray-tracing calculations, the disk temperature is set by Thydro and is
vertically uniform; the disk is puﬀed up in the vertical direction in the same way as for the
MCRT simulations (see equation 18 and related text); and the (big) dust grains are assumed
well mixed with gas with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.9 : 100 and an opacity identical to
that of big dust in the MCRT simulations. To simulate the inner disk in these ray-tracing
calculations, we ﬁll the inner 30 AU8 with H2 (number density 1010 cm−3 and temperature
50 K).

Figure 11 compares the ray-traced mm images with the MCRT images at 0.34 Myr. The
ray-traced images are dimmed by a factor of 3 to ﬁt within the same color scheme used for
the MCRT images. Qualitatively the morphology of the disk in the two sets of images are
similar, with the peak MCRT ﬂuxes lower by a factor of ∼3. This factor of 3 diﬀerence in
ﬂux is less than the factor of 10 diﬀerence in midplane temperature because the fragments
are optically thick.
In the end, the MCRT and ray-traced images agree that GI-induced
spirals and fragments in class 0/I disks at 400 pc can be detected and resolved by ALMA
with 1-hour integration times at 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) angular resolution.

4.2. Near-Term Prospects for Observing GI in Disks

Disks with Q < 1 fragment on dynamical, i.e., orbital timescales. Fragments produced
by GI may appear quickly, within ∼104 years, reducing the disk mass and stabilizing the
system against further activity (e.g., Stamatellos et al. 2011). Thus GI may be a short-lived

8The radius of the ray-traced inner disk is larger than the sink cell radius rin = 20 AU used in the hydro

simulations to ensure a smooth gas surface density proﬁle.

– 17 –

phenomenon that is diﬃcult to observe. However, GI can be recurring and prolonged if
fresh gas is supplied to the disk from its natal envelope, on timescales up to a few × 105
yr. Similarly, individual fragments may be lost (or downsized) as they get shredded by tidal
forces, migrate into the central star, or get ejected from the system (e.g., Vorobyov & Basu
2010a; Boley et al. 2010; Nayakshin 2010; Machida et al. 2011b; Zhu et al. 2012a; Basu &
Vorobyov 2012; Tsukamoto et al. 2015); but fragments can be recurring as well.

At mm wavelengths, envelopes do not much obscure our view of embedded disks. Con-
tamination from envelope emission is on the order of ∼30% in dust continuum emissions for
class 0 sources, and ∼10% for class I sources (Jørgensen et al. 2009). At NIR wavelengths,
the situation is more challenging, as disks can be heavily extincted by envelopes. Our MCRT
calculations ignore envelopes and should therefore be applied to systems in kind (i.e., late
stage I), or to disks with envelopes viewed nearly face-on with large opening angles for their
bipolar cavities.

We may search for GI in (1) disks with Mdisk (cid:38) 0.3M(cid:63), and (2) disks undergoing
accretion outbursts. Millimeter observations of class 0/I disks have conﬁrmed the presence
of large (> 100 AU) disks in a few systems (Tobin et al. 2015; Yen et al. 2015a; Choi et al.
2007), and have suggested a number of candidates with Mdisk (cid:38) 0.1M(cid:12) (Jørgensen et al.
2007, 2009; Eisner et al. 2008), modulo the usual uncertainties in gas-to-dust ratio and
dust opacity (e.g., Dunham et al. 2014). A particularly interesting case is HL Tau (ALMA
Partnership et al. 2015), which has an estimated disk mass of about 0.1M(cid:12), or 20% of the
stellar mass (Greaves et al. 2008; Kwon et al. 2011). Jin et al. (2016) have suggested that the
disk is marginally GI-unstable, and that disk self-gravity facilitates the formation of gaps by
relatively low-mass planets (e.g., Dong et al. 2015b; Dipierro et al. 2015).

Young stellar objects undergoing accretion outbursts, such as FUors and EXors, are
thought to be GI-unstable disks. Measuring their disk masses (e.g., Liu et al. 2016a) will
be crucial for validating this interpretation. These objects are excellent targets for future
high angular resolution observations to detect GI-induced spiral arms. In pioneering work,
Liu et al. (2016b) directly imaged spiral arms and streams in four FUors with Subaru. The
structures seen in the Subaru images resemble those in our NIR model images, supporting
the idea that FUors are GI-unstable protostellar/protoplanetary disks (e.g., Vorobyov &
Basu 2005, 2010b, 2015).

What are the implications if the clumps and spiral arms predicted by our synthetic

images are not seen?

1. If mm continuum observations do not detect the disk while NIR imaging observations
do, it may imply that we have overestimated the mm-wave dust opacity. In our model,

– 18 –

the mm opacity of the big grains (up to 1 mm in size) is about 13 cm2 g−1, consistent
with the results found by Draine (2006) to within factors of a few for grains of similar
sizes, and about two orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding opacity for
ISM grains. If substantial grain growth has not occurred in class 0/I disks, the mm
ﬂuxes of our models could be overestimated by up to two orders of magnitude.

2. If mm observations reveal no Keplerian disk beyond a few tens of AU (e.g., as suggested
in B335 by Yen et al. 2015b), it may imply the action of strong magnetic braking
(Krasnopolsky & K¨onigl 2002; Li et al. 2011; Machida et al. 2011a), enabled perhaps
by very small grains ∼10–100 ˚A in size that can couple magnetic ﬁelds to matter (Zhao
et al. 2016). NIR imaging observations may not see these small disks at all if they lie
inside the inner working angle (a few tens of AU at a few hundred pc).

3. If observations at both NIR and mm wavelengths show a large but featureless (i.e.,
axisymmetric) disk on scales (cid:38) 100 AU, the disk may either be insuﬃciently massive
to be GI-unstable (equation 1 is not satisﬁed) or cool on timescales so long that GI-
induced activity is too anemic to be detected (tcoolΩ (cid:29) 1; cf. equation 2).

5. Summary

Using 2+1D hydrodynamics simulations, we modeled the formation and subsequent
evolution of a protostellar disk starting from a molecular cloud core, for times ranging up
0.5 Myr. The disk, fed by an infalling envelope, experiences gravitational instability.
It
develops large-scale spiral arms, portions of which fragment. The resulting density structures
at six epochs spanning 0.12–0.43 Myr after the formation of the protostar are transformed
into NIR scattered light images and simulated ALMA dust continuum maps using a Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code. Our main conclusions are as follows.

1. As long as they are not obscured by an intervening envelope, GI-induced spiral arms
viewed at modest inclinations ((cid:46) 45◦) are visible at distances up to 1 kpc with the
current suite of NIR imaging instrumentation (including Gemini/GPI, VLT/SPHERE,
and Subaru/HiCIAO/SCExAO).

2. The spiral arms and streamers in four FU Ori objects recently revealed by Subaru (Liu
et al. 2016a,b) resemble GI-induced structures in our models, supporting the idea that
FUors represent GI-unstable disks (e.g., Vorobyov & Basu 2005, 2010b, 2015).

3. Clumps formed by disk fragmentation have such small vertical scale heights that they

are shadowed and appear as surface brightness depressions in NIR scattered light.

– 19 –

4. Both spiral arms and fragments in GI-unstable disks can be resolved and readily de-
tected (by ∼10σ for arms and by (cid:38) 40σ for fragments) in ALMA dust continuum
observations of sources at 400 pc with an angular resolution of 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48) and one-hour inte-
gration times. The minimum detectable fragment mass is ∼1 MJ under these observing
conditions.

Future work can focus on developing a 3D code that treats the hydrodynamics and
radiative transfer of self-gravitating disks self-consistently, and on allowing dust and gas to
slip past each other. Although our work is deﬁcient in these regards, it points robustly to
the observability of gravitational instability in protostellar disks, given the powerful instru-
mentation available today.

Appendix: Relation between the emergent radiative ﬂux and midplane

temperature

Let us consider a locally isothermal disk in vertical hydrostatic equilibrium.

In the
plane-parallel approximation, the thermal structure of the disk can be described by the
following system of radiative transfer moment equations:
= cρκP (B − E)
= −ρκRF ,

(20)

dF

dE

where c is the speed of light, ρ the gas volume density, κP and κR the Planck and Rosseland
mean opacities, E the radiation energy density, F the radiative ﬂux, B = aT 4 the radiation
energy density in thermal equilibrium (a = 4σ/c the radiation constant, T the gas tempera-
ture). Equation (20) indicates that the radiative ﬂux F depends on the diﬀerence between
emission and absorption in the vertical column of the disk. Equation (21) expresses the

(21)

– 20 –

relation between the radiative ﬂux and radiation energy density in the Eddington approxi-
mation.

This system of equations is closed with the following equation:

dF
dz

= ρS,

(22)

which states that the radiative ﬂux F is actually produced by a non-radiative heating source
ρS. Here, S is deﬁned as the heating rate per unit mass. It is convenient to rewrite these
equations using the integrated surface density from the midplane to a given vertical distance
ρ(z(cid:48))dz(cid:48). We note that Σ(h) ≡ Σ1/2 ≡ Σ/2 is the gas surface density from the

midplane to the disk surface. The resulting equations take the following form:

= −κRF

cκP (B − E) = S

(23)

(24)

(25)

We now assume that S is constant in the vertical direction, meaning that ρS is proportional
to the mass in the vertical column of the disk. Given that the radiative ﬂux is zero at the
midplane, the integration of equation (25) yields:

F = SΣ.

(26)

After substituting equation (26) into equation (24) and integrating equation (24) from the
midplane to the surface of the disk, we obtain:

E(Σ1/2) = E(0) − 3κRS

(27)

where E(0) and E(Σ1/2) are the radiation energy densities at the midplane and at the disk
surface, correspondingly. Now, let us adopt the following boundary condition at the disk
surface:

F (Σ1/2) =

cE(Σ1/2),

which assumes that radiation escapes from the disk surface isotropically. Using equation (26)
we obtain:

S =

Finally, substituting S in equation (27), we obtain the relation between the radiation energy
density at the disk surface surface and midplane:

Using equations (23) and (29), E(0) can be rewritten in the following form:

E(0) = B(0) − E(Σ1/2)

(31)

where τP = κP Σ1/2 is the Planck optical depth from the midplane to the disk surface and
B(0) the Planck radiation energy density at the midplane. Substituting equation (31) into
equation (30), we obtain:

Note. — Properties of the models. L(cid:63) includes both the photospheric and accretion luminosities. F0◦,FR
and F45◦,FR are the total spectral ﬂux densities from full-resolution 1.3 mm (ALMA band 6) MCRT images
at 0◦ and 45◦ viewing inclinations, respectively. F0◦,ALMA and F45◦,ALMA are the corresponding total
ﬂux densities in simulated ALMA observations using array conﬁguration #19 (beam size ∼ 0.1(cid:48)(cid:48)) and an
integration time of one hour (see also Figure 6). See Section 3 for details.
