We consider a mechanical resonator made of diamond, which contains a nitrogen-vacancy center
(NV center) locating at the end of the oscillator. A second order magnetic gradient is applied
and inducing coupling between mechanical modes and the NV center. By applying proper external
magnetic ﬁeld, the energy diﬀerence between NV center electron spin levels can be tuned to match
the energy diﬀerence between two mechanical modes a and b. A laser is used for continuously
initializing the NV center electron spin. The mode a with lower frequency is driven by a thermal
bath. We ﬁnd that the temperature of the mode b is signiﬁcantly cooled when the heating bath
temperature is increased. We discuss the conditions that quantum regime cooling requires, and
conﬁrm the results by numerical simulation. Finally we give the intuitive physical explanation on
this unusual eﬀect.

Cooling and manipulating the motion of mechanical
resonator is widely studied now [1].
It has wide ap-
plications in quantum information science [2–6], testing
quantum eﬀects in macroscopic systems [7–12], ultra-
sensitive sensing [13–18], etc. In order to cool mechan-
ical resonator, we should couple it to other cold sys-
tems such as cavity mode (optomechanics) [19–21], elec-
tronic spin (Nitrogen-vacancy centers) [22], etc. In op-
tomechanics, laser cooling of mechanical resonators is a
typical method.
Intuitively, this is not hard to under-
stand. A laser produces coherent light, which is well or-
dered (cold), and will make the mechanical system cou-
ples with a colder cavity bath [19, 20]. However, counter-
intuitively, recent research showed that a thermal light,
which is very hot, can also cool an opto-mechanical sys-
tem [23]. In this system, the mechanical resonator to be
cooled is coupled with two optical modes [24]. The low
frequency mode is in contact with a hot thermal light
while the high frequency mode is not, acting as an auxil-
iary part. After the system reaches the equilibrium state,
the thermal phonon number in the mechanical mode will
be smaller.

In a hybrid system that contains a NV center and a
mechanical resonator, a magnetic gradient is applied to
couple the NV center with the resonator. The NV center
is continuously initialized by a laser, and could be used
for cooling the mechanical resonator to the ground state
[22]. In previous literatures, the ﬁrst order magnetic gra-
dient was used for inducing coupling between the NV
center and the mechanical mode [22, 25–30]. It is quite
naturally to ask whether the higher order magnetic gra-
dient could be useful for coupling the NV center and the
mechanical resonator and cooling it.

In this letter, we studied how to cool a hybrid mechan-

ical resonator with the second order magnetic gradient.
We consider a hybrid system that contains a mechani-
cal cantilever and a NV center [30]. We apply a second
order magnetic gradient to induce the coupling between
NV center and the two mechanical modes a and b. The
electron spin transition frequency of the NV center is
tuned to match the mechanical modes frequencies dif-
ference. The NV center is continuously resetted to the
ground state by a laser. In this way, the NV center acts
as an eﬀective vacuum bath to cool the mode b. An in-
coherent driving (thermal bath) is applied on the lower
frequency mode a, and resulting a higher temperature of
it. The incoherent driving on mode a also increases the
eﬀective coupling between mode b and the NV center,
and cools the mode b. Unlike the Ref.
[23], where heat
was directly injected to cavity mode and indirectly cool-
ing the mechanical mode, here the mechanical resonator
is cooled by directly heating it. In addition, the quantum
regime cooling is possible under the current experimental
conditions.

The scheme As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a dia-
mond cantilever resonator that contains a NV center at
the end of it. Two mechanical modes a and b are under
consideration, with frequencies ωa < ωb. Two spin states
of the NV center electron are relevant here, | − 1i and
|0i. By applying proper magnetic ﬁeld, the energy split
between the two states of the NV center, ωz, is equal
to the energy diﬀerence of the two mechanical modes,
∆ = ωb − ωa. Due to the second order magnetic gradient
G2 = ∂2B/∂x2, the two mechanical degrees of freedom
will couple with the spin degrees of freedom.

Initially, both of the mechanical vibration states are in
the thermal state, where phonon occupation number dis-
tribution is determined by the average phonon number ¯na

or ¯nb in the respective environment. The NV center elec-
tron spin is initialized to the |0i state at the beginning.
We are going to demonstrate that, after the whole system
evolves to a stationary state, the phonon number of the
higher mechanical mode will be signiﬁcantly smaller than
the average phonon number of the environment around
it, that is, mode b has been eﬀectively cooled.

FIG. 1: A nano-diamond is fabricated as a thin membrane
which can oscillate along the x axis, while the defect of an
NV center is at the corner. A magnetic tip pointing along
the z axis is placed below the membrane, which can generate
second order magnetic gradient along the x axis. And an
external static magnetic ﬁeld Bext is added along the z axis
to induce Zeeman split in order to drive away the NV center
spin | + 1i state and keep the |0i and | − 1i state closer.

The Hamiltonian of the whole system can be expressed
as H = H0 + H1, where H0 is the non-interaction part
and H1 describes the interaction between the mechanical
resonator and the NV center electron spin.

perimentally, ωz ∼ 107 Hz, ga, gb, gab ∼ 10 Hz can be
realized (see Appendix).
Under the rotating wave approximation which shift the
energy zero point by ωa(a†a+b†b), we can change H0 into

Unavoidably, the system will go through some intrinsic
loss. The intrinsic decay rate Γ0 for NV center is much
less than 1 Hz at low temperature. By adding initial-
izing laser, the decay rate Γ for the NV center electron
spin would be much larger than the decay rates for the
mechanical modes γa and γb. The dephasing of NV cen-
ter is neglected, as it could be eliminated by continuous

2

dynamical decoupling [31]. However, as we will use the
same model to describe the decay of the spin and the
vibration, here we should make sure that Γ, γa, γb ≪ ωz.
As the evolution of the system contains decay and damp-
ing, it is convenient to describe it with quantum master
equation [32], which can be written out explicitly as

˙ρ = −i[H, ρ] + (La + Lb + Ls)ρ
La = (1 + ¯na)γaDa + ¯naγaDa†
Lb = (1 + ¯nb)γbDb + ¯nbγbDb†
Ls = ΓDσ−

Dx refers to the notation in Lindblad form, which is
Dx(ρ) = 2xρx† − x†xρ− ρx†x. The Eq.(3) will be solved
in both analytical and numerical methods. The results
of the both methods will be compared and discussed.

Analytical Solution. As mentioned above, the
phonon bath for mode a is very large, so the average
phonon number of mode a is almost always equal to the
average phonon number in the bath, that is, ha†ai = ¯na.
Moreover, as the phonon number of mode b is much
smaller than that of mode a, it is safe to drop the term
b†b in H1. If we denote δ = a†a− ¯na as the phonon occu-
pation number ﬂuctuation of mode a, under the rotating
wave picture, H1 can be simpliﬁed to

With the help of the projection operators tech-
niques [33], and after an approximation to the second
order expansion of ga, gb and gab, we can get the reduced
master equation for mode b and the electron spin mode s
after we adiabatically eliminate mode a (see Appendix )

The stationary phonon number of mode b can be plot-
ted as a function of the average phonon number of mode
a. The ﬁgure is shown in Figure 2. The trend of cooling
for the higher frequency vibration mode is quite obvious.
And for physical reasonable values of Γ (e.g. Γ ≫ γa, γb),
the cooling eﬀect is increasing if ¯na becomes larger.
We can further look at how diﬀerent values of Γ can
change the eﬀect of cooling. The qualitative trend can
be seen clearly from Figure 3. For a given value of ¯na,
when Γ increases from a small value to a relative large
value, there exists a certain Γ for which the cooling eﬀect
is the largest. Before the optimal cooling point, Γ is not
large compared with the eﬀective coupling (e.g., ga√¯na),

are shown. Blue dot line is for Γ = 20, black solid line is for
Γ = 80, red dash line is for Γ = 150. For a typical setup, we
can let ωz = 106, ga = √2, gb = 1, gab = 1, γa = 1, γb = 1,
¯nb = 10 after the original parameters are renormalized. The
value of ¯na changes from 0 to 3000.

so increase Γ will beneﬁt the cooling process. However,
after that, larger Γ will result in smaller cooling rate.
When ¯na increases, the optimal Γ will increase, too. In
the limit of ¯na → ∞, we can get a simple expression for

As shown in Fig. 3, such an approximation is quite rea-
sonable. In the limit of ¯na → ∞, the condition for quan-
tum regime cooling (hˆnbi < 1) is

Γ > 3γb(¯nb − 1),

which can be fulﬁlled by tuning Γ with laser. Unlike the
previous Ref.
[23], where there was an optimal heat-
ing bath temperature, here increasing heating hath tem-
perature will always cooling the resonator, which is an
outstanding property.

Numerical Simulation. In this part we discuss the
numerical simulation of the cooling process, and com-
pare the result with the analytical ones in the above
section. The idea is simple. We expand the quantum
operators and quantum states in the uncoupled repre-
sentation, that is, the Kronecker tensor product of the
occupation number representations for the three modes
involved. The matrix forms of Equation (3) can then
be calculated step by step with the classical four-order
Runge-Kutta method. The average phonon number for
mode b is equal to tr(ρNb), where Nb is the phonon num-
ber operator of mode b in the whole Hilbert space for
the system, namely, Nb = Is ⊗ Ia ⊗ (b†b).
It should
be pointed out, however, as the dimension of a matrix
cannot be too large for a numerical simulation, the re-
quirement ¯na ≫ ¯nb is not able to be satisﬁed here. As

a result, H1 in Equation (1) should be inserted in the
equation of motion Equation (3) instead of H

′

1.

We present several numerical results of the stationary
phonon number hˆnbi with the results we get from Equa-
tion (10), which is plotted in Figure 4. As can be seen
from the ﬁgure, when Γ ≫ γa, γb is satisﬁed, the analyti-
cal results match the numerical ones perfectly. But when
γa and γb is comparable with Γ, the two results no longer
agree with each other quantitatively. However, it is quite
reasonable, because in this case several approximations
for the analytical results are not valid any more. When
Γ is not very large, the term Ls = ΓDσ− does not dom-
inate over H in Equation (3). As ¯na is also at the same
scale with ¯nb in this case, now neglecting the back action
on mode a is not a good approximation. When mode
b is being cooled, mode a is being heated unavoidably,
thus lowering the eﬀect of cooling. The analytical results
which neglect the back action thus exaggerate the cool-
ing eﬀect. This trend is shown clearly from the ﬁgure.
But the analytical conclusions are still valid qualitatively.
For instance, if we ﬁx Γ, the larger ¯na is, the larger the
cooling eﬀect will be. And if we ﬁx ¯na, there exists a
¯na-dependent value of Γ where the cooling eﬀect is max-
imum.

Discussion and conclusion.

From the above
derivation and calculation, it is clear the lower frequency
mechanical mode will be signiﬁcantly cooled by heating
the higher frequency mechanical mode. In fact, this trend
can be seen directly from the Eq. (8), where L1 acts as
the cooling term. As the electron spin is much more
likely to be in the spin state |0i due to the continuous
initialization, the eﬀect of σ+ should be much larger than
that of σ−. So Dbσ+ is the dominant operator for evolu-
tion, and the mode b will be cooled. This can be under-
stood that mode a facilitate the energy transfer between
mode b and the spin. Quantized energy ﬂows from the
vibration mode to the NV center. Soon after that the

FIG. 4: Comparison of analytical and numerical eﬀects of
cooling. Here solid lines show analytical results, and points
show numerical results. Pink ones are for Γ = 120, black ones
are for Γ = 50, red ones are for Γ = 5, blue ones are for
Γ = 1.5. For a typical setup, we let ga = √2, gb = 1, gab = 1,
γa = 1, γb = 1, ωz = 500 after the original parameters are
renormalized. The initial phonon number for mode b is ¯nb =
1.

excitation in the NV center electron spin decays into the
environment through light. As this process is repeated,
the energy of the mechanical mode is gradually removed.
It should be noted that by tuning the external magnetic
ﬁeld, the NV center electron spin levels splitting could
match arbitrary mechanical modes frequencies diﬀerence.
Therefore, the scheme could be used for cooling all the
mechanical modes except the lowest one.

In conclusion, we studied the second order magnetic
gradient induced coupling between NV centers and the
mechanical mode. We proposed to drive one mechanical
resonator mode with thermal bath to cool the other mode
of the resonator. We solved the motion of the system
analytically under the weak coupling assumption. It is
found that ﬁnal thermal phonon number of the resonator
approach to a minimum as the thermal bath tempera-
ture increases. The quantum regime cooling is feasible
under the current experimental conditions. We numer-
ically solved the equations, and found that the results
ﬁtted precisely with the analytic results. The cooling by
heating phenomena does not violate the laws of thermo-
dynamics. This scheme can be understood as a thermal
machine or a heat engine [37, 38]. The mode a is an ”en-
gine”, and the NV center electron spin takes the role of
a ”condenser”. This work opens up the possibility that
cooling the mechanical mode in solid systems by injecting
the thermal phonon, which usually heats the system.

Experimentally realized paramters

In this section we discuss the values of parameters ωz,
ωa, ωb, ga, gb, gab, γa, γb, Γ that can be realized in
experiments.

As in former experiments (e.g. [22] for a Si cantilever),
the size of the resonator can be taken as 3µm× 0.05µm×
0.05µm. Considering that the density of diamond is
around 1.5 times the density of silicon [35], and the fact
that the eﬀective mass of a solid and normal shaped os-
cillator doing simple oscillation is of the same order as its
mass [1], we can estimate that ma = mb = 6.3 × 10−18
kg. The fundamental frequency of such a mechanical
resonator is around 10 MHz [22]. Although the zero-ﬁeld
splitting of the NV center is around 2.88 GHz [34], after
an external magnetic ﬁeld is exerted, the separation be-
tween |0i and | − 1i states can be reduced to the order
of tens of MHz. As a result, it is possible to fulﬁll the
requirement ωb−ωa = ωz. Here we choose ωa = 10 MHz,
ωb = 30 MHz for convenience. The quality factor of the
resonator is around Q = 106. Second-order magnetic gra-
dient G2 can realize several times of 1013 T · m−2 in ex-
periment [36]. By using ﬁnite element simulation, we got
that the maximum G2 could be around 5× 1014 T · m−2,
if the distance between NV center and the magnetic par-
ticles is 50 nm.

It G2 is set to be 1014 T · m−2, we will have ga = 15 Hz,
gb = 5 Hz, gab = 8.7 Hz. The decay rates of the mechan-
ical resonator can be estimated by γa = γb = ωa/Q =
10 Hz. Usually, the decay rate of the NV center is much
larger than the mechanical decay rate, for instance, Γ can
equals to 500 Hz.

Derivation of the Reduced Master Equation

Here we provide a derivation of Equation (5).

The reduced density matrix of mode b and mode s after

mode a is eliminated is

ρb,s = tra(ρ)

(13)

As in [33], we can use the projection operator to get

the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix

Derivation of the Adjoint Equations for the Number

In this part, the equations of motion for the number

operators ˆnb and ˆns, Equation (9), is derived.
The adjoint equations for Equation (8) are

It deserves notice that here we only keep the slow-
time-varying term, so we neglect a†2 and a2 above. Now
we come back to Equation (17), which can be simpliﬁed
term by term. As tra means taking the average on a, the
trace of odd multiples of a and a† equals to zero. Terms
containing iωz are neglected here because their eﬀect is
just changing the energy zero point.

Detail of the Numerical Simulation

In this section, we discuss in detail the numerical sim-

ulation.

For Figure 4, we control the accuracy so that all num-
bers are accurate until the order of 0.001. The evolution
time is t = 3, after which the state is sure to be at the
stationary state up to the accuracy. As very large num-
bers and very small numbers are not good choices for

numerical simulation, we renormalize the parameters as
gab = gb = 1, ga = √2, γa = γb = 1. As we want to cover
a wide range of results, four values for Γ are chosen: 1.5,
5, 50 and 120. Small values for the phonon numbers
¯na and ¯nb should be chosen due to the calculation cost.
Here we always choose ¯nb = 1 as the initial condition.
As to ¯na, we choose ¯na = 1, 2, 3. The dimensions of the
matrices in the Hilbert space are chosen to balance the
accuracy and the cost of calculation resource. For the
Hilbert space where the initial phonon number equals to
1, the dimension is chosen as 15 × 15. For the Hilbert
space where the initial phonon number equals to 2, the
dimension is chosen as 27 × 27. For the Hilbert space
where the initial phonon number equals to 3, the dimen-
sion is chosen as 40× 40. Obviously, the dimension of the
Hilbert space for mode s is always 2 × 2. The steplength
for the Runge-Kutta method is chosen to be 0.01/50.
Figure 4 shows the results of only the ωz = 500 case.
However, for each given value of Γ and ¯na, we choose two
values of ωz in the calculation. Please see the following
tables for the data. It is obvious that the diﬀerence be-
tween the results from two ωz is very small. So we are
safe to use smaller ωz here considering the stability of
the simulation even if the real renormalized value for ωz
should be on the order of 106. This deduction also agrees
with the analytical result because Equation (10) does not
contain ωz as long as ωz is large enough for n

FIG. 5: The time evolution of the phonon number of mode
b. The renormalized parameters for the black line this ﬁgure
are: ωz = 500, ga = √2, gb = gab = 1, γa = γb = 1, Γ = 50,
¯na = 4, ¯nb = 1. The matrix dimension of the operators and
states for mode a is taken to be 80×80, for mode b it is 20×20.
For the red line which is the solution of diﬀerential equation
Equation (9), standard solver ode45 in Matlab is used.

The time evolution of one set of parameters from nu-
merical simulation is shown in Figure 5. The phonon oc-
cupation number hˆnbi gradually goes down as the system
evolves towards the stationary state. The cooling eﬀect
indeed happens. Also shown in the ﬁgure is the time evo-
lution starting from the analytical result, Equation (9).
The two lines are very similar with the cooling eﬀect of
the analytical one a little bit more obvious, which also
supports our ﬁndings.
