In self assembled III-V semiconductor quantum dots, valence holes have longer spin coherence
times than the conduction electrons, due to their weaker coupling to nuclear spin bath ﬂuctuations.
Prolonging hole spin stability relies on a better understanding of the hole to nuclear spin hyperﬁne
coupling which we address both in experiment and theory in the symmetric (111) GaAs/AlGaAs
droplet dots.
In magnetic ﬁelds applied along the growth axis, we create a strong nuclear spin
polarization detected through the positively charged trion X+ Zeeman and Overhauser splittings.
The observation of four clearly resolved photoluminescence lines – a unique property of the (111)
nanosystems – allows us to measure separately the electron and hole contribution to the Overhauser
shift. The hyperﬁne interaction for holes is found to be about ﬁve times weaker than that for
electrons. Our theory shows that this ratio depends not only on intrinsic material properties but
also on the dot shape and carrier conﬁnement through the heavy-hole mixing, an opportunity for
engineering the hole-nuclear spin interaction by tuning dot size and shape.

Introduction.(cid:22) The spin coherence of carriers in semi-
conductor quantum dots (QDs) is limited by interactions
with the nuclear spin bath ﬂuctuations because the car-
rier and nuclear spins are eﬃciently coupled through the
hyperﬁne interaction [1–3]. In III-V semiconductors the
strength of the hyperﬁne interaction for valence holes is
about one order of magnitude weaker than that for the
conduction electrons due to the diﬀerent symmetry of
the Bloch amplitudes [4, 5]. This results in longer hole
spin coherence times and makes the hole spin in QDs
an excellent candidate for quantum state manipulations
[6–11]. Further engineering of the hole hyperﬁne interac-
tion is needed to achieve even longer spin coherence times
[12], both for epitaxially grown and gate deﬁned quan-
tum dots that conﬁne single holes [13]. However, the hole
hyperﬁne coupling is experimentally diﬃcult to access,
the challenge is to separate spectroscopically the weaker
hole-nuclear spin interaction from the stronger electron
hyperﬁne interaction [14]. Measurements of heavy hole
hyperﬁne constants for holes were performed on QD en-
sembles [6, 15, 16] and for individual QDs in several
material systems, namely, InP/GaInP [12, 17] and In-
GaAs/AlGaAs QDs [12, 18], as well as in GaAs/AlGaAs
interface ﬂuctuation dots [12]. In these experiments, the
hole hyperﬁne coupling constant was measured only in
particular QDs with very low point symmetry using “for-
bidden” transitions to detect the Overhauser splittings of
dark exciton states.

Here we propose a new approach to measure and even-
tually engineer the hyperﬁne interaction for the heavy
hole spins in QDs. As a model system we use the strain
free GaAs/AlGaAs QDs grown by the droplet epitaxy
on (111)A substrates, in contrast to conventional [001]-
grown samples used in all the previous studies on the
hole hyperﬁne interaction. As a result of the speciﬁc
trigonal C3v symmetry of the dots four diﬀerent exciton
states are observed in the magneto-photoluminescence
(magneto-PL) as well-separated lines [19, 20] of the pos-

itively charged trion X+, a complex formed of two holes
with antiparallel spins and an unpaired electon, in a mag-
netic ﬁeld applied along the growth axis [111], see Fig. 1.
The presence of four lines allows one to separately mea-
sure the electron and hole Overhauser shifts for every
QD in our system. For the investigated dots we extract
a ratio of the heavy hole to electron hyperﬁne interac-
tion constants Ceﬀ/A ≈ 0.2, which is diﬀerent in both
amplitude and sign compared to the recent studies on
[001]-grown GaAs dots [12]. For the standard (001) QDs
the heavy hole hyperﬁne coupling with a given nucleus is
determined by a single constant, mainly determined by
the Bloch amplitude [5, 12, 21]. As we theoretically show,
this is not the case for the (111) QDs: Here the heavy
hole hyperﬁne interaction is governed by two constants
and the eﬀective Overhauser splitting is strongly aﬀected
by the envelope function. Hence, the hyperﬁne interac-
tion for holes can be engineered by growing dots with
diﬀerent size and shape [22]. An additional advantage of
(111) QDs is very strong dynamic nuclear polarization
(DNP) [23] in this strain free system [24]: In particu-
lar, the induced Overhauser splitting of the electron spin
sublevels largely exceeds their Zeeman splitting.

Samples and Experimental Set-up.(cid:22) The sample we
study is the same as in Ref. 25.
It was grown by
droplet epitaxy using a standard molecular beam epitaxy
system [19, 26–28]. Starting from the n+-GaAs(111)A
substrate, the sample consists of 50-nm n-GaAs (Si:
1018 cm−3), 100-nm n-Al0.3Ga0.7As (Si: 1018 cm−3),
20-nm Al0.3Ga0.7As tunnel barrier, GaAs QDs, 120-nm
Al0.3Ga0.7As, 70-nm Al0.5Ga0.5As, and 10-nm GaAs cap.
In this model system dots are truly isolated as they are
not connected by a 2D wetting layer [23, 26], contrary
to Stranski-Krastanov dots and dots formed by quantum
well interface ﬂuctuations [29]. A semitransparent Ti/Au
layer with a nominal thickness of 6 nm serves as a Schot-
tky top gate.

The single dot PL is recorded at T=4 K with a home

build confocal microscope with a detection spot diameter
of (cid:39) 1 µm [20, 23]. The detected PL signal is dispersed by
a double spectrometer and detected by a Si-CCD cam-
era with the spectral precision of 1 µeV. Nonresonant
optical excitation used for initial dot characterization is
achieved by pumping the AlGaAs barrier with a HeNe
laser at 1.96 eV. For intra-dot quasi-resonant excitation
typically 1 LO-phonon above the transition energy, a tun-
able cw Ti-Sa laser (nominal laser FWHM=40 µeV) is
used. The laser polarization control and PL polarization
analysis are performed with Glan-Taylor polarizers and
liquid crystal waveplates. Magnetic ﬁelds up to 9 T can
be applied parallel to the growth axis [111] which is also
the angular momentum quantization axis and the light
propagation axis (Faraday geometry). All results pre-
sented here apply to the positively charged trion X+.

Results and Discussion.(cid:22) Using a charge tunable de-
vice, one can study independently positively charged tri-
ons X+, neutral excitons X0 and negatively charged tri-
ons X−, see Fig. 1a and Refs. [25, 30] for details. The
carrier-nuclear spin interaction is probed through the X+
radiative recombination with the PL circular polariza-
tion Pc = (Iσ+ − Iσ−)/(Iσ+ + Iσ−) directly proportional
to the average spin z-component of the unpaired elec-
tron, Pc = −2Sz. Here Iσ+, Iσ− are the integral intensi-
ties of the circularly polarized components of the X+ PL
emission. Performing LO-phonon assisted excitation of
the trion ground state with a σ+ polarized laser, we ob-
serve a highly σ+ polarized emission of the X+ trion with
Pc > 80% [31]. Application of a longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld Bz || [111] results in four optically allowed emission
lines, two lines per each circular polarization [19, 20], see

scheme in Fig. 1c. A typical evolution of the four opti-
cal transitions with the ﬁeld Bz is presented for linearly
polarized laser excitation in Fig. 1b. Under the linearly
polarized excitation, no DNP is achieved and the lines
evolve continuously with increasing the applied magnetic
ﬁeld, Fig. 1b.

A completely diﬀerent behaviour of the PL lines is ob-
served for the circularly polarized excitation which re-
sults in optical pumping of carrier and nuclear spins,
see Fig. 1e. First of all, we observe an additional Over-
hauser shift (OHS) of the PL lines proportional to the
eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld Bn (cid:107) z experienced by the carri-
ers due to the nuclear spin polarization [32]. Secondly,
at Bz = Bcr ≈ 3.4 T the order of the four transitions
changes abruptly: at Bz < Bcr the outer spectral lines
are substantially weaker than the inner lines (Fig. 1d),
whereas for Bz > Bcr the strong intensity lines become
the outer ones (Fig. 1f), as in the case of linearly polar-
ized laser excitation. The abrupt jumps of the PL lines
at Bz = Bcr indicate the nuclear spin polarization col-
lapse and ineﬃciency of DNP. This is a direct signature
of the non-linear carrier-nuclear spin interaction observed
already in other QD systems [2, 33–36] and illustrated in
more detail in the supplement [31]. Moreover, according
to Fig. 1d, at Bz < Bcr the eﬀective nuclear ﬁeld Bn,e
acting on the electron spin is larger in magnitude and
opposite in sign to Bz. As a result, the order of electron
spin-up and spin-down levels is reversed compared to the
case where the DNP is absent, Figs. 1b,f. At Bz = Bcr

the DNP collapses and the normal order of the four op-
tically allowed transitions is restored. The critical ﬁeld
Bcr for the nuclear polarization collapse varies from dot
to dot and, in this nanosystem, takes values between 2 T
and 4 T.

Next we show that the hole hyperﬁne interaction con-
stant can be measured by analysing the four well sep-
arated lines due to the X+ optical recombination. We
recall that the four emission lines rather than two ap-
pear in magneto-PL from magneto-induced heavy-hole
mixing, the eﬀect related with the trigonal, C3v, point
symmetry of (111) QDs [19]. The Zeeman eﬀect for heavy
holes is thus governed by two g-factors, gh1 and gh2, de-
scribing the diagonal and oﬀ-diagonal contributions to
the eﬀective Hamiltonian in the basis of | ± 3/2(cid:105) states,

(cid:17)

,

where σ(h)
are the eﬀective heavy-hole spin ma-
trices [19, 20]. Due to nonzero value of gh2, the hole
states are mixtures of the | ± 3/2(cid:105) basic states enabling
four radiative recombination channels for the X+ trion,
see Fig. 1c. As a result, the QD symmetry provides a
natural optical access to all four exciton states and al-
lows us to measure precisely the separate heavy-hole and
electron contributions to the Overhauser shifts. In con-
trast, the [001]-grown dots with the C2v symmetry show
only two emission lines for excitons in a magnetic ﬁeld
applied in the Faraday geometry [37, 38].

metry of [001]-grown dots is reduced to Cs or C2, e.g.,

lines appear allowing one to separate the hole and elec-
tron Overhauser shifts in these very particular dots, as in
Refs. [12, 17]. On the other hand, a deviation from the
C3v symmetry of many [111]-grown dots in our samples
is negligible and they are excellent sources of entangled
photon pairs (biexciton-exciton cascade) [39]. The four
transitions that we use here are all optically allowed for
perfectly symmetric C3v dots and therefore the hole and
electron Overhauser shift determination does not rely on
ﬁnding an exotic dot with reduced symmetry. Further
details of the electron and hole OHS extraction are pre-
sented in the Supplementary information [31]. Particu-
larly, the hole contribution to the OHS is clearly seen for
the two typical dots from diﬀerent samples, see Fig. 2. In
the presence of DNP the electrons and holes experience
Overhauser shifts quantiﬁed as additional contributions
∆hy,e = A(cid:104)Iz(cid:105) and ∆hy,h = Ceﬀ (cid:104)Iz(cid:105) to the electron and
hole Zeeman splittings, respectively, Fig. 2(e). Here (cid:104)Iz(cid:105)
is the average nuclear spin projection on the z-axis [2], A
and Ceﬀ are the eﬀective electron and hole hyperﬁne cou-
pling constants. The experiment allows us to extract the
ratio Ceﬀ/A ≈ 20% for typical dots, see Fig. 2, which is
the average value taken from measurements in the mag-
netic ﬁeld range where the Overhauser ﬁeld is fairly con-
stant. An eventual weak dependence of the coeﬃcient
Ceﬀ on Bz is discussed in the supplement [31]. Surpris-
ingly, our measured ratio Ceﬀ/A ≈ 20% is about four
times larger than the value reported for GaAs/AlGaAs
interface ﬂuctuation dots [12] and, moreover, in InGaAs
dots the values of about one tenth with the opposite sign
were reported [12, 18].

This unexpected result is due to the C3v point symme-
try of the (111) dots which dictates the following form of
the hole-nuclei interaction Hamiltonian [31]

Like the Zeeman Hamiltonian (1), the hyperﬁne interac-

For suﬃciently strong external magnetic ﬁelds such as
h2, the
heavy-hole spin states are deﬁned by the Zeeman eﬀect,
and the hyperﬁne Hamiltonian (2) can be treated as a
small perturbation with respect to Eq. (1). In this case
one has

It follows then that the heavy-hole hyperﬁne interaction
in the dots under study is deﬁned not only by the mate-
rial constants C1 and C2 but also, through the eﬀective g-
factors gh1 and gh2, by the dot size and shape. A possible
origin of C2 can be the cubic anisotropy contributions to
the hyperﬁne coupling [12] as well as orbital contributions
caused by an admixture of light-hole to heavy-hole states
(further analysis is beyond the scope of this paper) [31].
We stress that this is a major diﬀerence compared to the
previous studies on hole-nuclear spin interaction which
used the [001]-grown QDs, where the size and shape of
the QD only weakly aﬀects the Ceﬀ /A ratio.

Conclusion.(cid:22) In summary,

in the symmetric [111]-
grown GaAs droplet dots we measure, without the need
in symmetry breaking, the hole hyperﬁne constant to be
∼5 times smaller than the electron one. Using symmetry
considerations we have shown that the sign and ampli-
tude of the hole hyperﬁne interaction constant in the dots
of the C3v symmetry reveal an important advantage as
compared to the standard (001) QD systems investigated
so far. The hole hyperﬁne constant in the (111) quantum
dots is sensitive to the dot geometry through the light-
heavy-hole mixing opening the way for engineering the
hole-nuclear spin interaction [22, 40].

I. EFFICIENT OPTICAL PUMPING OF

NUCLEAR SPINS IN (111) GaAs QUANTUM

DOTS

Experimentally,

for optical orientation of charge-
carrier and nuclear spins we use quasi-resonant, circu-
larly polarized excitation. In our charge tunable device,
we select a bias region where the positively charged trion
X+ emission dominates. As the two holes form a spin
singlet, the average polarization Pc of the X+ PL emis-
sion is determined by the electron spin projection Sz as
Pc = −2Sz. This allows us to measure the electron spin
polarization via the circular polarization degree of the
PL and the nuclear spin polarization via the Overhauser
shift [33]. If we plot both quantities as a function of the
applied magnetic ﬁeld Bz we see the bistable behaviour
typical of the charge carrier spin system coupled to the
nuclear spins via the hyperﬁne interaction [2, 33–36]. In
Fig. 1 of the main paper we only plot the sweep with
increasing ﬁeld direction, which shows the dynamic nu-
clear polarization (DNP) collapse at Bz = 3.4 T . The
measurements of the hole and electron contribution to
the hyperﬁne interaction are carried out well before the
collapse, at magnetic ﬁelds Bz around 2 T in Fig. 2 of
the main text.

Figure 3: Upper panel: The total Overhauser shift (electron
+ hole contribution) is plotted as a function of magnetic ﬁeld
Bz for diﬀerent sweep directions. Lower Panel: The PL po-
larization of the X+ emission is plotted, showing a bistability
of the electron spin polarization as Pc = −2Sz.

II. HEAVY-HOLE AND ELECTRON

HYPERFINE HAMILTONIANS IN (111)

QUANTUM DOTS

A. General symmetry analysis

z

We recall that in the (111) QDs with the C3v point
symmetry the electron Kramers doublet transforms ac-
cording to the two-dimensional irreducible representation
Γ4, while the heavy-hole doublet transforms according to
the reducible representation Γ5 ⊕ Γ6 [? ]. As a result,
the eﬀective Hamiltonians of hyperﬁne interaction can
be conveniently expressed via the corresponding electron
spin-1/2 and hole-pseudospin-1/2 operators represented
by the sets of the Pauli matrices σ(e) = (σ(e)
y , σ(e)
z ),
σ(h) = (σ(h)
). Hereafter we use the frame
x (cid:107) [11¯2], y (cid:107) [¯110], z (cid:107) [111] related to the growth axis
of the dots.

The Ga and As isotopes have nuclear spins I = 3/2.
Therefore, nuclear states transform according to the re-
ducible representation Γ4 ⊕ Γ5 ⊕ Γ6. The splittings of
nuclear states with |Iz| = 1/2 and |Iz| = 3/2 are con-
trolled by quadrupolar interactions, which are expected
to be minor in our strain-free QDs. Hence, it is con-
venient to describe the nuclear spin as a pseudovec-
tor I = (Ix, Iy, Iz) composed of the angular momen-
tum 3/2 matrices and treat quadrupolar eﬀects for nu-
clei separately. By contrast, in our QDs the splitting
between the heavy- and light-hole states is substantial,
(cid:38) 10 meV [20, 25], therefore it suﬃces to focus on the
heavy-hole doublet only. Table I presents the combina-
tions of basic matrices of angular momentum 3/2 trans-
forming according to the irreducible representations of
the C3v point group. Additionally, we marked the com-
binations in accordance to their parity under the time-
reversal.

In the isotropic approximation A(cid:107) = A⊥ and other

in general, the bulk
hyperﬁne Hamiltonian for the electron has the form
σ(e) · (AI + A(cid:48)I 3)/2 described by two constants, with
z(cid:48)) in the cubic axes frame x(cid:48), y(cid:48),
the I 3 = (I 3
z(cid:48). The second contribution nonlinear in I is small and
usually disregarded. The terms with A(cid:107), A⊥, A(cid:48)
(cid:107) and
A(cid:48)
⊥ are allowed in the uniaxial approximation. The re-
maining terms (with A(cid:48)(cid:48)
⊥) result from the trigo-
nal symmetry of the quantum dot. These terms describe
noncollinear coupling of the electron and nuclear spins,
which may result, e.g., in the nuclear spin relaxation and
“dragging” of QD transition with the laser at a resonant
excitation [2]. Note, that the light-hole hyperﬁne interac-
tion is described by the Hamiltonian of the same form as
Eq. (4) because the light hole states transform according
to the two-dimensional irreducible representation Γ4.

It is noteworthy that all coeﬃcients Cl (l = 1..7) except
for C1 and C3 are related with the trigonal symmetry of

7

the dot; particularly the terms proportional to C2 and C4
may result in the hyperﬁne-coupling induced heavy-hole
spin relaxation. Noncollinear terms, as corresponding
terms in the electron Hamiltonian (4), may be derived
in the high-order perturbation theory. In the following
we focus on the coeﬃcients C1 and C2 involved in the
description of the optical orientation of spins along the z
axis in the longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld B.

B. Relation with the bulk hyperﬁne coupling

The hyperﬁne interaction of the electron (hole) and
nuclear spins is dominated by the Bloch functions of the
charge carriers in the vicinity of the nucleus [41? ? ].
Therefore, it could be expected that the main contribu-
tions to the hyperﬁne interaction Hamiltonians, Eqs. (4),
(5), result from the averaging of the bulk Hamiltonian
over the charge carriers wavefunctions.
In particular,
the heavy-hole hyperﬁne coupling is described in the Td
point symmetry relevant to the bulk GaAs by the general
Hamiltonian where we retain only linear in nuclear spin
I terms:

hy,h =

(6)
where we use the coordinate frame x(cid:48) (cid:107) [001], y(cid:48) (cid:107) [010],
z(cid:48) (cid:107) [001] related to the cubic crystallographic axes, and,
to shorten the notations, J 3 = (J 3
z(cid:48)), A is the
isotropic hyperﬁne coupling constant for the electron, M1
and M2 are dimensionless parameters. To derive this
Hamiltonian we use the fact that the pseudovectors J,
I, J 3 transform according to the same F1 irreducible
representation of the Td point group.
In the Hamilto-
nian (6) we leave only contributions, which are odd in
components of J and I and lead to the splitting of the
hole spin sublevels. In bulk semiconductors, the isotropic
part of the hole hyperﬁne interaction, proportional to the
M1, has been addressed in a number of works, see, e.g.,
Refs. [5, 21, 41], microscopically it can be derived tak-
ing into account the dipole-dipole interaction of nuclear
spins with the hole states assuming atomic-like p-shell or-
bital Bloch functions X (r), Y(r) and Z(r) of the valence
band. In Ref. [12] it has been pointed out that the Td
symmetry allowed admixture of d-shell atomic orbitals to
p-shell in orbital functions yields M2 (cid:54)= 0.

C. Account for the heavy-light-hole mixing

known for standard (001) QDs [12, 21], but also in an ap-
pearance of nonzero C2, even neglecting cubic anisotropy
terms in the bulk Hamiltonian (6). We stress that this
eﬀect is absent in standard (001) QDs where Q vanishes
from the symmetry arguments.

8

The values of C1 and C2 are modiﬁed if one takes
into account the heavy-light-hole mixing in the studied
dots. The two ground spin states of the heavy-hole in
the C3v dots can be presented as linear combinations of
the |±3/2(cid:105) and |±1/2(cid:105) Bloch functions [20]
∓(r)|∓1/2(cid:105) .

III. HEAVY-HOLE OVERHAUSER SHIFT IN

EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD

A.

Interplay of Overhauser and Zeeman eﬀects

We will now analyze the heavy-hole Overhauser shift in
the presence of external longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld B =
(0, 0, Bz). A heavy-hole localized in a C3v dot experiences
a joint action of the hyperﬁne ﬁeld described by Hhy,h
[see Eq. (5)], and the external magnetic ﬁeld described
by the Zeeman Hamiltonian [19]

(cid:18)gh1

.

(11)

Here gh1 and gh2 are the two eﬀective heavy-hole g-
factors; the microscopic theory of these parameters is
developed in Ref. [20]. We note that at at the nonzero
magnetic ﬁeld Bz and average value (cid:104)Iz(cid:105) (cid:54)= 0, both the
hyperﬁne (Hhy,h) and the Zeeman (HZ) Hamiltonians
couple the heavy holes with the ±3/2 angular momen-
tum projections onto the z-axis.

(12)
It is worth to mention that, for the optical transitions
from the initial X+ state with the electron spin s = ±1/2
to the ﬁnal single-hole state ±, the Zeeman and hyperﬁne
contributions to the photon energy is given by sµBBz +
ε∓.

We deﬁne the Overhauser shift as the diﬀerence:

∆OS = (ε+ − ε−) − ghµB|Bz|

(13)

(cid:113)

=

(gh1µBBz + C1 (cid:104)Iz(cid:105))2 + (gh2µBBz + C2 (cid:104)Iz(cid:105))2 − ghµB|Bz|.

els, i.e., the splitting at (cid:104)Iz(cid:105) = 0, gh =(cid:112)g2

Here ghµBBz is the Zeeman splitting of the hole spin lev-
h2. Un-
der experimental conditions the Zeeman splitting caused
by the external ﬁeld exceeds by far the Overhauser shift

h1 + g2

for holes making it possible to reduce Eq. (13) to

∆OS = Ceﬀ (cid:104)Iz(cid:105) ,

with

(15)

in agreement with Eq. (3) of the main text. In this limit
the hole spin states are ﬁxed by the magnetic ﬁeld and the
nuclear eﬀect can be evaluated in the ﬁrst-order pertur-
bation theory. Interestingly, the eﬀective hyperﬁne cou-
pling constant depends both on the magnitude and sign
of gh2. Note that, contrary to conventional [001]-grown
quantum dots, the eﬀective hyperﬁne constant Ceﬀ in the
(111) dots depends not only on the material character-
istics C1 and C2, but also, through gh1 and gh2, on the
particular dot size and shape.

It is worth to mention that, as it follows from Eq. (13),
the Overhauser shift is a nonlinear function of the nuclear
spin polarization (cid:104)Iz(cid:105) and depends on the external ﬁeld
Bz for ﬁxed (cid:104)Iz(cid:105). This results in a weak dependence of
Ceﬀ deﬁned by Eq. (14) on the magnetic ﬁeld as demon-
strated in Fig. 2 of the main text.

B. Numeric estimations of hyperﬁne constants and

comparison with experiments

9

The hole hyperﬁne coupling constants are still debated in
the literature. The detailed ﬁtting of the present exper-
imental data and the data of Ref. [12] should be carried
out in a consistent manner and it is beyond the scope of
the present work. Here, to illustrate that such the ﬁt-
ting may result in an agreement we take, for instance,

Figure 4: The measured Zeeman splitting and Overhauser
shifts are plotted for OD II for the valence holes (left panel)
and conduction electrons (right panel)

N /B(e)

N /B(e)

Let us introduce the eﬀective nuclear ﬁelds B(e)

N =
N = |Ceﬀ(cid:104)Iz(cid:105)|/(ghµB) acting on an
A(cid:104)Iz(cid:105)/(geµB) and B(h)
electron and a hole. Their ratio is given by B(h)
N =
(|Ceﬀ|/A)(ge/gh). The analysis of intensities of lines gives
ge > 0 and gh1 < 0 in our dots [42], moreover, as fol-
lows from Fig. 1(b) of the main text, ge/gh ∼ 0.1. As-
N ∼ 0.02. In
suming |Ceﬀ|/A = 0.2 we obtain B(h)
the studied range of external magnetic ﬁelds we have
N | ∼ (1 ÷ 1.5)Bz, in agreement with Fig. 1(e) and
|B(e)
N |/Bz ∼ 0.1÷0.15
Fig. 2 in the main text. Therefore, |B(h)
N | which is conﬁrmed by comparison of the
and Bz (cid:29) |B(h)
Zeeman splitting and the Overhauser shift presented in
Fig. 4. This justiﬁes the validity of Eqs. (14) and (15).
Now we turn to estimating the values of the hole hy-
perﬁne constants C1 and C2 given by Eq. (8) and Ceﬀ
given by Eq. (15). A hole in the dot experiences interac-
tion with both Ga and As nuclei, therefore the hyperﬁne
constants should be averaged over the spin polarization
of two nuclei species. Assuming equal spin polarizations
of the Ga and As nuclei, we obtain

C1,2
A

=

1,2 + C (As)
C (Ga)

.

(16)

The values of the electron hyperﬁne constants are well
established [2]: A(Ga) = 42 µeV and A(As) = 46 µeV.

which results in the somewhat smaller absolute value of
the C (Ga)/A(Ga) = −0.045 and the larger value of the
C (As)/A(As) = 0.19 in the (001) QDs, which are still in-
side the error bounds of Ref. [12]. For this choice of
parameters and gh2 > 0 we have the |Ceﬀ /A| ≈ 0.06 for
both trigonal QDs. This value is slightly smaller than
the experimentally extracted ratio |Ceﬀ /A| = 0.2 ± 0.1
but, given the error margin of the current data and the
data of Ref. [12], such an agreement can be considered as
satisfactory. Further, the agreement may be improved by
taking into account the orbital contribution to C2 caused
by the heavy-light hole mixing, Eq. (10b).

To provide a complete description the further experi-
mental and theoretical studies are needed. Particularly,
on experimental side element-sensitive measurements on
the (111) QDs will provide an additional information on
the signs and magnitudes for the ratio Ceﬀ /A for Ga and
As isotopes. This, together with the data of Ref. [12],
would provide a more complete picture of the hyperﬁne
coupling for holes and establish stronger restrictions on
the model parameters. As for the theory, a simultaneous
ﬁtting of data on (001) and (111) quantum dots taking
into account also the orbital contribution to C2 is chal-
lenging.
