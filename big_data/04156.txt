The interpretation of searches for Dark Matter (DM) (or any other LHC physics result)
requires that one assumes a model leading to the signal under consideration. This is nec-
essary to compare searches across channels, searches at other center-of-mass energies or at
other collider experiments. The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC coordinated in
2015 a joint forum to address this issue, in collaboration with theorists. This ATLAS/CMS
DM Forum produced a report [1], providing a ﬁrst set of concrete simpliﬁed DM models
used by ATLAS and CMS to interpret their searches for missing transverse energy (MET)
signatures.

At the end of the DM forum’s activities, a formal LHC Dark Matter WG (LHCDMWG)
was created, to continue the discussion and harmonisation of the way in which the LHC DM
results are interpreted, reported and compared to those of other experimental approaches.
This document provides the LHCDMWG recommendations on how to present the
LHC search results involving the s-channel models considered in [1] and how to compare
these results to those of direct (DD) and indirect detection (ID) experiments. This doc-
ument is the result of the discussions that took place during the ﬁrst public meeting of

– 1 –

the LHCDMWG [2], and it is intended to provide a template for the presentation of the
LHC results at the winter conferences in 2016. It reﬂects the feedback obtained from the
participants and in subsequent iterations with members of the experiments and of the the-
ory community and it is based on work described recently in [3–9]. For earlier articles
discussing aspects of simpliﬁed s-channel DM models, see also [10–21].

The relevant details of simpliﬁed DM models involving vector, axial-vector, scalar
and pseudo-scalar s-channel mediators are ﬁrst reviewed in Section 2. Section 3 presents a
recommendation for the primary treatment of LHC DM bounds and introduces all of the
basic assumptions entering the approach. Section 4 describes a well-deﬁned translation
procedure, including all relevant formulas and corresponding references, that allows for
meaningful and fair comparisons with the limits obtained by DD and ID experiments.

2 Models considered

The recommendations in this proposal, adopt the model choices made for the early Run-2
LHC searches by the ATLAS/CMS DM Forum [1]. In this document we discuss models
which assume that the DM particle is a Dirac fermion χ and that the particle mediating
the interaction (the “mediator”) is exchanged in the s-channel.1 After simplifying assump-
tions, each model is characterised by four parameters: the DM mass mDM, the mediator
mass Mmed, the universal mediator coupling to quarks gq and the mediator coupling to
DM gDM. Mediator couplings to leptons are always set to zero in order to avoid the strin-
gent LHC bounds from di-lepton searches. In the limit of large Mmed, these (and all) models
converge to a universal set of operators in an eﬀective ﬁeld theory (EFT) [13, 14, 26–29].
In this section, we review the models and give the formulas for the total decay width of
the mediators in each case.

2.1 Vector and axial-vector models
The two models with a spin-1 mediator Z(cid:48), have the following interaction Lagrangians

Note that the universality of the coupling gq guarantees that the above spin-1 simpliﬁed
models are minimal ﬂavour violating (MFV) [30], which is crucial to avoid the severe
existing constraints arising from quark ﬂavour physics.

The minimal decay width of the mediator is given by the sum of the partial widths for
all decays into DM and quarks that are kinematically accessible. For the vector mediator,

is left for future iterations and will thus not be discussed in the following.

Note that fscalar(τ ) and fpseudo-scalar(τ ) are still deﬁned for τ < 1, but in this case the form
factors are complex. The tree-level corrections to the total widths of the mediator again
do not contribute if Mmed < 2mDM,q, meaning that the corresponding ﬁnal state cannot
be produced on-shell. Decays to gluon pairs are only relevant for mediator masses between
roughly 200 GeV and 400 GeV and if invisible decays are kinematically forbidden.

3 Presentation of LHC results

The simpliﬁed DM models deﬁned in the last section aim at capturing accurately the
characteristics of MET production at high-energy colliders. They can be understood as a
limit of a more general new-physics scenario, where all but the lightest dark-sector states
are assumed to be suﬃciently decoupled, so that only the interactions that are relevant at
LHC energies are interactions between the mediator and DM as well as the SM quarks.
Aside from this important caveat, a presentation of collider bounds in the simpliﬁed model
framework requires no further assumptions, meaning that LHC searches can be used to
set model-independent bounds on the parameter space of a simpliﬁed model, and that the
constraints arising from diﬀerent channels — e.g. mono-jets and di-jets — can be directly
compared (see for instance [31]). In this section, we spell out the model choices underlying
the LHC limits and the relic density calculations. Issues arising in the DD and ID context
are discussed in subsequent sections.

3.1 Mass-mass plane

The advocated plots represent only two dimensional slices of the full four dimensional
parameter space of the proposed simpliﬁed models. To allow for a qualitative understanding
of the dependence of the results on the mediator couplings gq and gDM, we advocate
an auxiliary ﬁgure that shows the limit on the “signal strength” µ, i.e. the ratio of the
experimental limit to the predicted signal cross section for ﬁxed masses or ﬁxed coupling
scenarios. We recommend however to clarify that a limit on µ must not be confused with a
bound on a rescaling factor for the couplings and thus in general cannot be used to translate
the exclusion limit in the mass-mass plane from one set of couplings to another. The reason
is that changing gq and gDM typically modiﬁes the total width of the mediator, which can
change the kinematic distributions of the signal and thus the exclusion bounds in a non-
trivial way. Furthermore, for scenarios where the mediator widths varies signiﬁcantly as the
function of the considered parameter (e.g. mass-mass plane), we suggest to add supporting
material that illustrates the variation of the width in these parameters.

The primary presentation recommended for LHC results in the simpliﬁed model lan-
guage are plots of the experimental conﬁdence level (CL) limits on the signal cross sections
as a function of the two mass parameters mDM and Mmed for a ﬁxed set of couplings gq
and gDM. An example of such a “mass-mass” plot is given in Figure 1. It shows 95% CL
exclusion limits (black and yellow curves) for the case of a vector mediator. The limits
are derived from a hypothetical LHC mono-jet measurement. The particular choice of
axes, with Mmed on the x-axis and mDM on the y-axis, follows the convention adopted

– 4 –

Figure 1: 95% CL exclusion contours in the mass-mass plane for a simpliﬁed model with a
vector mediator, Dirac DM and couplings gq = 0.25 and gDM = 1. The black solid (dashed)
curve shows the median of the observed (expected) limit, while the yellow curves indicate
an example of the uncertainties on the observed bound. A minimal width is assumed and
the excluded parameter space is to the bottom-left of all contours. The dotted magenta
curve corresponds to the parameters where the correct DM relic abundance is obtained
from standard thermal freeze-out for the chosen couplings. DM is overproduced to the
bottom-right of the curve. The shown LHC results are intended for illustration only and
are not based on real data.

when interpreting supersymmetry searches at the LHC. The parameter space shown in the
mass-mass plots can be divided into three regions:

On-shell region: The on-shell region, Mmed > 2mDM, is the region where LHC searches
for MET signatures provide the most stringent constraints. The production rate
of the mediator decreases with increasing Mmed and so does the signal strength in
mono-jet searches. In this region the experimental limits and the signal cross sections
depend in a complex way on all parameters of the simpliﬁed model, and it is therefore
in general not possible to translate the CL limit obtained for one ﬁxed set of couplings
gq and gDM to another by a simple rescaling procedure.

Oﬀ-shell region: In the oﬀ-shell region, Mmed < 2mDM, pair-production of DM parti-
cles turns oﬀ and the constraints from MET searches rapidly lose power. The cross
sections become proportional to the combination g2
DM of couplings, so that in prin-
ciple the LHC exclusions corresponding to diﬀerent coupling choices can be derived by
simple rescalings. Deviations from this scaling are observed on the interface between
on-shell and oﬀ-shell regions Mmed (cid:39) 2mDM [32]. Note that for Mmed < 2mDM an

region can be probed by non-MET searches such as di-jets or di-tops. We also note
that if the mediator is light and very weakly coupled to the SM quarks, constraints
from DD and/or ID on these models may be typically stronger than those from the
LHC.

Heavy mediator limit: The DM EFT limit is approached as the mediator mass Mmed
becomes large. In this limit the mono-jet cross sections scale with the fourth inverse
√
power of the eﬀective suppression scale M∗ = Mmed/
gq gDM. For perturbative
gq gDM (cid:28) 4π), the EFT results apply to mediators with masses in
couplings (i.e.
the multi-TeV range.

√

As in the template plot, any presentation of the LHC limits has to clearly state the
model assumptions made to obtain the exclusion contours. We thus advocate to explicitly
specify on the ﬁgure the simpliﬁed model, including the mediator and DM type, and the
choices of couplings. Besides the observed exclusion bound, the median of the expected
limit and uncertainties (e.g. those arising from scale variations or ambiguities related to the
choice of parton distribution functions, as well as experimental uncertainties) are useful
information that can be added to these plots. All these ingredients have been included
in Figure 1.

The usefulness of the bound on µ is thus limited to cases where kinematic distributions
are the same for diﬀerent realisations of the simpliﬁed model. Such a situation is realised for
example in the on-shell region if all couplings are suﬃciently small, so that the total decay
width of the mediator obeys Γmed (cid:46) 0.3Mmed. Under these circumstances, one can use
the narrow-width approximation (NWA) to show, for example, that in the case of a spin-1
mediator the mono-jet cross section σ(pp → χ ¯χ + j) factorises into mediator production
σ(pp → Z(cid:48) + j) and the invisible branching ratio Br(Z(cid:48) → χ ¯χ). This factorisation implies
that a bound on µ can be used to infer a limit on the invisible branching ratio Br(Z(cid:48) → χ ¯χ)
of the spin-1 mediator relative to the one in the benchmark model without regenerating the
underlying signal Monte Carlo (MC). Since the NWA can be an imperfect approximation
even for weak couplings gq and gDM (see for instance [32]), we recommend that care is
taken if relying on this argument.

If readers would like to reinterpret experimental limits for diﬀerent coupling choices,
it is their responsibility to ensure that kinematic distributions remain unchanged. To make
this issue clear, we recommend that captions of plots showing limits on µ include a state-
ment along the lines of “Note that the bound on µ only applies to coupling combinations
that yield the same kinematic distributions as the benchmark model.”.

3.2 Choice of couplings for presentation of results in mass-mass plane

At present, we recommend that mono-jet-like searches produce limits for a single choice of
couplings. The ATLAS/CMS DM Forum report [1] forms the basis of our recommendations
for the simpliﬁed models given in Section 2.
In particular, we advocate the following
coupling values to produce the limits on signal strengths:

– 6 –

Vector mediator: gDM = 1 and gq = 0.25.

Axial-vector mediator: gDM = 1 and gq = 0.25.

Scalar mediator: gq = 1 and gDM = 1.

Pseudo-scalar mediator: gq = 1 and gDM = 1.

The quark coupling gq should be universal in all cases and the width of the mediator
should be set to the minimal width, meaning that it is assumed that the mediator has no
couplings other than gq and gDM.2 The choices above provide for a consistent comparison
across collider results within a given simpliﬁed model. They ensure that the mediator has
Γmed/Mmed (cid:46) 10% and that the theory is far from the strong coupling regime. The choice
of gq = 0.25 for spin-1 mediators is furthermore motivated by the requirement to avoid
di-jet constraints from the LHC and earlier hadron colliders (see e.g. [31]). When readers
are interested in extrapolating the provided results to other coupling values, it is their re-
sponsibility to understand how changing gq and gDM will aﬀect the kinematics of the signal
and therefore the experimental CL limits. To facilitate such an extrapolation, ATLAS and
CMS could provide additional information (e.g. tables of acceptances, eﬃciencies, number
of events generated, total experimental uncertainty, number of events passing analysis cuts
for benchmark signals) corresponding to the recommended coupling choices as supplemen-
tary material, as detailed in Appendix B of [1]. As discussed in [1], the kinematics of vector
and axial-vector models is very similar in the case of jet radiation. The same consideration
applies for the scalar and pseudo-scalar models in the mono-jet channel, while diﬀerences
are seen for heavy ﬂavour ﬁnal states.

3.3 Overlaying additional information on LHC results

Fixing both gq and gDM has the advantage that, in a given model, one can compare the
LHC results to relic density calculations or the limits obtained by DD and ID experiments.
Nevertheless, such comparisons typically require additional assumptions and should be
done carefully. We discuss a few possibilities below. In all cases, we recommend to keep
the plots simple, and to specify the assumptions clearly or to produce several variations to
indicate the impact that diﬀerent assumptions have on the ﬁnal results.

3.3.1 Relic density

Relic density calculations can be overlaid on the mass-mass plot to indicate where the
particles and interactions of a speciﬁc simpliﬁed model are by themselves suﬃcient for
explaining the observed DM abundance. For the simpliﬁed models recommended by the
ATLAS/CMS DM Forum, this curve corresponds to the parameters for which the observed

2Using the same value of gq for all quarks is theoretically well motivated for the vector, scalar and
pseudo-scalar mediator. For the axial-vector mediator, it would also be interesting to consider gu = gc =
gt = −gd = −gs = −gb, which arises naturally if the vector mediator corresponds to the massive gauge
boson of a new broken U (1)(cid:48) and the SM Yukawa couplings are required to be invariant under this additional
gauge symmetry. The relative sign between the coupling to up-type and down-type quarks is important if
interference plays a role and aﬀects the comparison between LHC and DD results.

– 7 –

relic abundance is compatible with a single species of DM Dirac fermion and a single
mediator that couples to all SM quarks with equal strength. One should not conclude that
a simpliﬁed model is ruled out for values of model parameters that are inconsistent with
the relic density overlay. Rather, one should conclude that additional physics beyond the
simpliﬁed model was relevant for determining the DM abundance in the early Universe.

When calculating the relic density, we recommend to include all tree-level processes
relevant for the DM annihilation.
In particular, when Mmed < mDM, annihilation into
on-shell mediators are typically active, and are particularly important when gDM (cid:29) gq
(e.g. [21]), for which cross sections are typically insensitive to gq, unlike LHC processes.

Numerical tools, such as micrOMEGAs [33] and MadDM [34], can be used to calculate the
regions of relic overproduction or underproduction for the simpliﬁed models recommended
by the ATLAS/CMS DM Forum. We provide the results of MadDM calculations for the
models described in Section 2 at [35]. These results were obtained using the coupling
values speciﬁed in Section 3.2. The reader should be aware that the axial-vector calculation
does not include an explicit constraint from perturbative unitarity (described below). The
provided curves correspond to Ωχh2 = 0.12 (the relic DM density observed by WMAP [36]
and Planck [37]) for the models considered. Larger mediator masses as well as smaller DM
masses (below the curves) correspond to larger values of Ωχh2 (and conversely for smaller
mediator masses and larger DM masses).

3.3.2 Perturbativity limits, anomalies and issues with gauge invariance

The couplings recommended by the ATLAS/CMS DM Forum have been ﬁxed to values
which are perturbative, with the mediator width always suﬃciently smaller than the medi-
ator mass. However, it was shown in [31, 38] that perturbative unitarity is violated in the
axial-vector model due to the DM Yukawa coupling becoming non-perturbative, even for
perturbative values of gq and gDM, if mDM is signiﬁcantly larger than Mmed. It was argued
that this consideration implies m2
for the recommended value gDM = 1. It is therefore proposed to indicate the line corre-

med) < 1/2, which yields mDM <(cid:112)π/2Mmed
sponding to mDM =(cid:112)π/2Mmed in the mass-mass plot for the axial-vector case in a similar

DMg2

DM/(πM 2

style as for the relic density constraint (i.e. just a line, no shading).

Another potential problem of the vector and axial-vector model is that they are not
anomaly free if the Z(cid:48) boson couples only to quarks but not to leptons. This implies that
the full theory that ultraviolet completes (2.1) and (2.2) must include new fermions to
cancel the anomalies. While these fermions can be vector-like with respect to the SM,
they will need to be chiral with respect to the new gauge group that gives rise to the Z(cid:48).
In consequence, the additional fermions must have masses of the order of the symmetry-
breaking scale, which is at most a factor of a few above Mmed [38]. While the existence of
additional fermions will lead to new signatures, the precise impact on LHC phenomenology
depends on the speciﬁc way the anomalies are cancelled. The resulting model dependence
is diﬃcult to quantify and we thus propose to ignore the issue of anomalies until it has
been studied in detail by theorists.

The interactions between the spin-0 mediator and the quarks present in the simpliﬁed
scalar model are not SU (2)L invariant. As a result, these interactions will violate pertur-

– 8 –

bative unitarity at high energies in tree-level process like pp → W + φ (φ → χ ¯χ). The cor-
responding amplitudes are however proportional to the squares of the light-quark Yukawa
couplings, so that in practice unitarity-violating eﬀects are expected to have a negligible
impact on the outcome of MET searches at the LHC. Still in SU (2)L invariant theories
that provide speciﬁc realisation of the s-channel scalar mediator interactions (2.7), like for
instance the fermion singlet DM model (see e.g. [9]), the resulting LHC phenomenology
can be modiﬁed by the new ﬁelds that are needed to make the full theory gauge invariant.
These modiﬁcations are again model dependent and lacking detailed theoretical studies,
their eﬀect on the LHC bounds cannot yet be quantiﬁed.

3.3.3 Additional plots

Above, we recommend that LHC searches present the mass-mass plot, ﬁxing both gq and
gDM, as the primary result. If desired, additional information on the coupling dependence
of the results can be conveyed by producing a related set of limits where one of the mass
parameters and one of the couplings has been ﬁxed, and the other mass parameter and
coupling are varied. As discussed in the previous section, a correct treatment of varying
couplings is one which correctly accounts for the varying acceptance of the search.

3.3.4 Non-collider DM searches

Interpreting non-collider results in the simpliﬁed model framework involves additional as-
sumptions, and generally requires detailed knowledge of how the non-collider results were
produced. For example, as discussed above, the relic density predicted by the simpliﬁed
model varies from point to point on the mass-mass plot, whereas non-collider results are
typically presented under the assumption that the density of the DM particle under con-
sideration saturates the cosmological density (i.e. that there is just one species of DM).
These assumptions may be consistent if there is additional physics (not captured by the
simpliﬁed model) that aﬀects the relic density calculation but is irrelevant to the LHC
signals (see e.g. [39]). However, it is also a possibility that the DM particle probed by
non-collider experiments constitutes only a certain component of the DM density, so their
results would have to be rescaled accordingly (see for instance [31]). Because of the am-
biguity of this rescaling, we do not recommend mapping from non-collider results onto
the LHC mass-mass plots. The following section addresses the comparison of LHC and
non-collider results.

4 Comparison to non-collider results

Although we advocate mass-mass plots as the primary presentation of LHC results, it is
nevertheless interesting and informative to compare the LHC limits with the results from
other DM searches. To avoid the diﬃculties associated with reinterpreting the results of
non-collider experiments, we recommend translating the LHC results onto the plots of non-
collider experiments, rather than the reverse procedure. When performing a translation to
the non-collider planes, it is important to bear in mind the diﬀerent underlying assumptions.
While the DD or ID bounds may be valid for multiple DM models, the LHC limits hold

– 9 –

exclusively for the mediator under investigation and for the speciﬁc choices of the couplings
used in the simpliﬁed model.

For a given mediator the translation procedure is well-deﬁned.

In this section, we
explain all of the ingredients needed for a correct translation into the cross section-mass
planes in which DD and ID experiments present their results. As input, we use LHC
bounds in the mass-mass plane for ﬁxed couplings gq and gDM (see Section 3). To compare
with DD experiments, these limits are translated into the planes of the DM mass mDM
versus the spin-independent (SI) or spin-dependent (SD) DM-nucleon cross section, σSI
or σSD. For a comparison with ID experiments, the limits are instead converted into the
plane deﬁned by mDM and the DM annihilation cross section (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105).

4.1 DD experiments

DD experiments search for the recoil of a nucleus scattering oﬀ a DM particle traversing
the detector. Since the DM particle is non-relativistic, the dominant interactions between
DM and nuclei can be described by two eﬀective parameters, namely the SI and SD DM-
nucleon scattering cross sections. DD experiments present their limits as bounds on these
cross section as a function of mDM, where common units for the cross section are either
cm2 or pb. The bounds are presented at 90% CL, as opposed to the 95% CL limits that
are the standard in the collider community. For the sake of comparison, we recommend to
present the LHC limits on the mDM–σSI/SD planes at 90% CL.

SI/SD and the DM-neutron scattering cross sections σn

In principle, it is necessary to distinguish between the DM-proton scattering cross
sections σp
SI/SD. For SI interactions,
however, DD bounds are always shown under the assumption that σp
SI, which also
holds for the simpliﬁed models proposed here. For SD interactions it is common to present
separate bounds on σp

SI = σn

SD and σn

SD and it is possible to compare LHC results with both.

There are currently a rather large number of DD experiments that have diﬀerent tar-
get nuclei and use diﬀerent detection technologies. For SI interactions, the most sensitive
experiments for DM particles heavier than O(10 GeV) are two-phase xenon experiments.
There are two large competing collaborations employing this technology, LUX [40] and
XENON1T [41] (previously XENON100). LUX has published results from its ﬁrst run
and is currently collecting more data to improve its sensitivity. XENON1T will soon begin
its ﬁrst run and aims to have ﬁrst results in late 2016. For DM particles lighter than
O(10 GeV), solid state cryogenic detectors as used by the SuperCDMS [42] and CRESST-
II [43] collaborations are more constraining than xenon experiments as their energy thresh-
old is lower.

As mentioned above, for SD interactions, separate bounds are published on σp
SD
and σn
SD. This is because DM scatters with the spin of the isotope which is approxi-
mately due to an unpaired neutron or unpaired proton. In practice this means that DD
experiments have good sensitivity to σp
SD but not both. The strongest DD limits
on σp
SD are
from LUX [46].3

SD are from the PICO collaboration [44, 45], while the strongest limits on σn

The simpliﬁed models with a vector and scalar mediator lead to a SI interaction,
while the axial-vector and pseudo-scalar mediator induce SD interactions. The pseudo-
scalar interaction has additional velocity-suppression in the non-relativistic limit, which is
not present in the other interactions. In practice this means that pseudo-scalar interactions
are only very weakly testable with DD experiments. For this reason, we will only describe
the translation procedure into the mDM–σSI/SD plane for vector, axial-vector and scalar
interactions.

Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 detail procedures for translating LHC limits onto to the
mDM–σSI/SD planes. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate the conventions recommended for the
presentation of results obtained from these procedures. These plots show the minimum
number of DD limits that we recommend to show. Bounds from other experiments may
also be included. As in the mass-mass plots, we recommend to explicitly specify details of
the mediator and DM type, the choices of couplings and the CL of the exclusion limits. It
may also be useful to show theoretical and experimental uncertainties. Generally, the LHC
searches exclude the on-shell region in the mass-mass plane such that for a ﬁxed value of
mDM, the exclusion contour passes through two values of Mmed. This means that when
translating into the mDM–σSI/SD planes, for a ﬁxed value of mDM, the exclusion contour
must pass through two values of σSI/SD. This explains the turnover behaviour of the LHC
contours observed in Figures 2a and 2b.

SD and the SD DM-neutron scattering cross section σn

We emphasise that the same result is obtained both for the SD DM-proton scattering
cross section σp
SD. Using (4.10) it is
therefore possible to map collider results on both parameter planes conventionally shown
by DD experiments. Should only one plot be required, we recommend comparing the LHC
results to the DD bounds on σp

SD, which is typically more diﬃcult to constrain.

In the future, it is desirable to consider not only the case gu = gd = gs, but also the
case gu = −gd = −gs, which is well-motivated from embedding the simpliﬁed model in the
SM gauge group and can be included without much additional eﬀort. For gu = −gd = −gs
one obtains approximately f p(gq) = 1.36 gu and f n(gq) = −1.18 gu, i.e. the DM-neutron
cross section is slightly smaller than the DM-proton cross section.4

4.1.3 Neutrino observatories: IceCube and Super-Kamiokande

The IceCube [53] and Super-Kamiokande [54] neutrino observatories are also able to con-
strain the SI and SD cross sections. When DM particles elastically scatter with elements in
the Sun, they can lose enough energy to become gravitationally bound. Self-annihilation of
the DM particles produces neutrinos (either directly or in showering) that can be searched
for in a neutrino observatory. When the DM capture and annihilation rates are in equilib-
rium, the neutrino ﬂux depends only on the initial capture rate, which is determined by
the SI or SD cross section [55].

The IceCube and Super-Kamiokande limits on σp

SD are of particular interest as they
can be stronger than the corresponding bounds from DD experiments. The former bounds
are however more model dependent, since they depend on the particular DM annihilation
channel. For annihilation only into light quarks, the limits are weaker than DD experiments.
For mb < mDM < mt, on the other hand, the dominant annihilation channel of the axial-
vector model is to b¯b and Super-Kamiokande sets more stringent constraints than DD
experiments for mDM < 10 GeV. For mDM > mt, the dominant annihilation channel is
to t¯t and the resulting constraints from IceCube are stronger than DD experiments. Both
the Super-Kamiokande and IceCube limits can be shown together with other bounds on
the SD DM-proton scattering cross section.

4LHC searches are only sensitive to the relative sign between gu and gd if both types of quarks are present
in a single process (e.g. u ¯d → u ¯d + χ ¯χ or u¯u → d ¯d + χ ¯χ). Such processes give a subleading eﬀect in mono-jet
searches and are presently not included in the signal computation. As a result, the signal prediction for
mono-jets turns out to be independent of the relative sign between the individual quark couplings [52].

– 13 –

While strong bounds are obtained for annihilation into bosons or leptons, these cou-
plings are not present in the simpliﬁed models considered here. Therefore, we do not
recommend showing the IceCube or Super-Kamiokande limits for annihilation into bosons
or leptons. Note also that the IceCube bounds may be further modiﬁed if the DM particles
can directly annihilate into the mediator (see the discussion in [56]). For mDM (cid:46) 4 GeV, the
eﬀects of DM evaporation from the Sun are important, so placing limits on σp
SD and σSI from
neutrinos coming from the Sun becomes very diﬃcult in this low-mass regime (see e.g. [57]).

4.2

ID experiments

For a pseudo-scalar mediator, the rate at DD experiments is suppressed by additional
velocity-dependent terms entering the cross section. As a result, DD experiments have very
little sensitivity for this scenario and it is not worthwhile to compare LHC results to the
usual bounds on SI and SD cross sections. Instead, LHC bounds can be compared against
the limits from ID experiments. For example, Fermi-LAT places 95% CL constraints on the
self-annihilation cross section from observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies [58].5 Limits
are set on the cross section (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) to annihilate to a single particle-anti-particle ﬁnal state.
There are a number of subtleties when dealing with these limits. Firstly, all of the
bounds shown in [58] are for a Majorana fermion. ID annihilation cross section limits for
a Dirac fermion are larger by a factor of two and therefore need to be rescaled before they
can be compared to the Dirac DM simpliﬁed model considered here. Secondly, the limits
are for single particle-anti-particle ﬁnal states while models typically include more than one
ﬁnal state. For the pseudo-scalar model, for example, DM annihilates to all quarks with
branching ratios approximately proportional to m2
In practice, however, the gamma-
q.
ray ﬂux that is observed from annihilating to diﬀerent quarks (or gluons) is small [60].
The Fermi-LAT limits [58] also demonstrate that there is a negligible diﬀerence between
the limits on (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) in u¯u and b¯b ﬁnal states. We therefore suggest to only show the bound
on u¯u from Fermi-LAT in comparison with the calculated bound on the total annihilation
cross section, as representative of the limits to ﬁnal states involving linear combinations of
diﬀerent quarks or gluons.

The annihilation cross section into a q ¯q ﬁnal state is (see e.g. [61] for a recent example)

5The galactic center is also potentially a promising DM target. Current observations show an excess
of gamma rays which are roughly consistent with a DM signal, but cannot be conclusively identiﬁed as
such due to poorly understood astrophysical backgrounds [59]. The regions of simpliﬁed models capable of
reproducing this excess are currently regions of particular interest for collider and direct searches.

Figure 3: A comparison of the LHC result to the Fermi-LAT limit in the mDM–(cid:104)σvrel(cid:105)
plane. Both limits are at 95% CL. The Fermi-LAT limit is for Dirac DM and assumes that
the only annihilation channel is to u¯u quarks. The Fermi-LAT limits to other quark-anti-
quark annihilation channels will be similar. The LHC exclusion contour is for a pseudo-
scalar mediator, Dirac DM and couplings gq = 1 and gDM = 1. The shown LHC results
are intended for illustration only and are not based on real data.

where fpseudo-scalar(τ ) has been deﬁned in (2.16) and αs is the strong coupling constant,
which we recommend to evaluate at the scale µ = 2mDM. The total cross section is
then given by the sum of the quark and gluon channels (4.11) and (4.12) as well as any
annihilation channels into on-shell mediators which are kinematically allowed and are not
suppressed by the small relative velocities of DM in the galactic halo.

Figure 3 depicts the translation of LHC bounds for a pseudo-scalar mediator to the
mDM–(cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) plane. As with the other plots, we recommend to specify explicitly details
including the mediator and DM type, the choices of couplings and the CL of the exclusion
limits.
It is also important to emphasise that the ID limit is for Dirac DM instead of
Majorana DM as assumed in the Fermi-LAT publication. Since the LHC exclusion contour
in the mass-mass plane passes through two values of Mmed, the LHC limit shows a similar
turnover behaviour in the mDM–(cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) plane. In Figure 3 we have depicted both branches
of the exclusion contour that are obtained for ﬁxed DM mass mDM. It may also be desirable
to show the values of (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) in Figure 3 that produce the observed relic density. A standard
reference providing the values of (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) as a function of mDM is [62]. We reemphasise the
point made in [62] that their displayed values of (cid:104)σvrel(cid:105) should be multiplied by a factor of
two for Dirac DM.

on the DM-nucleon scattering cross section or the DM self-annihilation cross section plane
always require an assumption on the density of DM particles. In particular, it is always
assumed that the particle under consideration constitutes all of the DM in the Universe.
If χ is only one out of several DM sub-components, bounds from DD and ID experiments
would become weaker, while the LHC bounds remain unchanged.
