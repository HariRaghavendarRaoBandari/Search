Abstract

Based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, we ﬁnd that LiZnBi, a metallic hexagonal ABC compound,

can be driven into a Dirac semimetal with a pair of Dirac points by strain. The nontrivial topo-

logical nature of the strained LiZnBi is directly demonstrated by calculating its Z2 index and the

surface states, where the Fermi arcs are clearly observed. The low-energy states as well as topologi-

cal properties are shown to be sensitive to the strain conﬁgurations. The ﬁnding of Dirac semimetal

phase in LiZnBi may intrigue further researches on the topological properties of hexagonal ABC

materials and promote new practical applications.

INTRODUCTION

Ferroelectrics have been studied for decades for their unique properties and technical

potentials1. Ferroelectric hysteresis, one of the features of ferroelectrics, can be used in infor-

mation storage, similar to ferromagnetic hysteresis. Several years ago, hexagonal ABC semi-

conductors were proposed as a new family of materials exhibiting proper ferroelectricity2.

This new family of ferroelectric materials takes a diﬀerent lattice structure from that of

the well-studied ABO3 perovskite oxides, which greatly enhances the lattice compatibility

of ferroelectrics with other functional materials. Moreover, it is found that some materi-

als of this family are hyperferroelectrics3. Diﬀerent from other known proper ferroelectrics,

the polarization in hyperferroelectrics persists regardless of depolarization ﬁelds, which are

common in surfaces or interfaces.

When spin-orbit coupling eﬀect is considered, more interesting phenomena emerge out in

this family of compounds. Topological insulators have attracted much interest due to their

thrilling properties such as dissipationless metallic surface states and potential techniqual

applications in spintronics and quantum computations4,5. Recent theoretical calculations

including spin-orbit coupling eﬀect indicate that KMgBi is a three dimensional (3D) strong

topological insulator6. Recently, as another kind of exotic quantum matter with nontrivial

topology, Dirac semimetal, whose valence bands and conduction bands only touch at isolated

points (Dirac points), also becomes a hot topic because of its own novel features including

Fermi arcs7 and large linear magnetoresistance8, as well as its close relationship with other

topologically nontrivial phases (such as Weyl semimetal). Na3Bi9 and Cd3As2

10 are two

well-studied 3D Dirac semimetal systems. As for the search of more realistic materials, a

natural question to ask is whether Dirac semimetal phase can also be found in hexagonal

ABC compounds.

In this work, based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, we show that LiZnBi is a 3D Dirac

semimetal under proper strain conﬁgurations. By analyzing the components of low-energy

electronic states, we ﬁnd that there exists band inversion at the Γ point in strained LiZnBi.

We further identify the nontrivial topological nature of the system by both the topological

index and nontrivial surface states. Finally, we study the response of low-energy states to

diﬀerent strain conﬁgurations and provide the phase diagram of Dirac semimetal in strained

LiZnBi.

while Li atoms are located at 2a. (b) The ﬁrst Brillouin zone and its projections on (100) and

II. METHODS

The ﬁrst-principles calculations are carried out by using density functional theory (DFT)

with the projector augmented wave method11,12, as implemented in the Vienna ab initio

simulation package13. Plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoﬀ of 300 eV are used.

The atomic structure is fully relaxed with 10 × 10 × 6 Monkhorst-Pack k points and the

local-density approximation (LDA)14,15 for the exchange-correlation interactions between
electrons, until the residual forces are less than 1 × 10−3 eV/˚A. Then the electronic struc-

ture is calculated with a modiﬁed Becke-Johnson exchange potential16 where the spin-orbit

coupling is included. The maximally localized Wannier functions are obtained by the pro-

gram Wannier9017. The Green’s function method18 is used to calculate the surface electronic

spectrum and surface states.

III. RESULTS

The lattice structure of LiZnBi, shown in Fig. 1 (a), belongs to the space group P 63mc.

Li+ ions occupy the interstitial sites of the wurtzite lattice of ZnBi−19. The calculated lattice

3

constants of the stable structure are a0 = 4.47˚A and c0 = 7.28˚A, close to those experimental
values (a0 = 4.58˚A and c0 = 7.38˚A) reported in the Inorganic Crystal Structural Database20.

The ﬁrst Brillouin zones of the bulk, (001) surface and (100) surface are shown in Fig. 1

(b).

Figure 2 shows the calculated band structure of LiZnBi in its stable (unstrained) and

strained structures with spin-orbit coupling considered.

In both cases, besides the low

conduction bands along the M-L line, the low-energy states are mainly located along the A-

Γ line and around the Γ point. Notice that even though inversion symmetry is broken in the

lattice structure, all the bands along the A-Γ are doubly degenerate. The double degeneracy

is protected by the combination of C6 rotation symmetry and σ mirror symmetry. The

rotation axis is along (001) direction and the reﬂection plane includes the rotation axis. The

key reason is that these two symmetry operators doesn’t commute with each other along

the A-Γ when the spin freedom is considered. For the states at the Γ point labelled by their

representations, our calculations indicate that the Γ7 (s) and Γ8 states are dominated by s

orbitals. In contrast, the Γ9 and Γ7 (p) states are mainly contributed by px ± ipy orbitals of

Bi atoms and pz orbitals of Bi atoms, respectively. For the four corresponding bands along

the A-Γ line, we ﬁnd that the main components remain the same for Γ9 and Γ8. For the

rest two bands, the varying sizes of red dots imply that the relative ratios of s orbitals from

Zn and Bi atoms change as k moves along the A-Γ. The two bands belonging to the same

representation Γ7 strongly couple with each other.

For the unstrained structure, the band order at the Γ point is Γ7 (p) > Γ9 > Γ8 > Γ7 (s).

In conventional semiconductor LiZnSb, Γ7 (p), Γ9 are in valence bands and Γ8, Γ7 (s) are in

conduction bands21. Therefore, compared to LiZnSb, LiZnBi has two sets of band inversion:

both Γ7 (s) and Γ8 fall below Γ7 (p) and Γ9. The substitution of Sb atoms by Bi atoms

increases the energy of p orbitals from the nitrogen family, pushing up Γ7 (p) and Γ9. The

Γ7 (p) (Jz = ± 1

2) [see Fig. 2 (a)] due to the p-d hybridization
induced negative spin-orbit coupling22. Herein Jz denotes the total angular momentum

2) state is above Γ9 (Jz = ± 3

in the z [or (001)] direction. The strong coupling between Γ7 (s) and Γ7 (p) pushes their

corresponding bands away from the Fermi level along the A-Γ. And the crossing (Dirac

point) between the rest two bands is at the Fermi level. Unfortunately, there is no global

gap at Γ − K − M plane [see the inset of Fig. 2 (a)] and neither Z2 index nor mirror Chern

number can be well-deﬁned.

FIG. 2. (Color online). Band structure along high-symmetry lines of LiZnBi in its unstrained

structure (a) and strained structure (b). For (b), a = 0.98a0 and c is tuned to keep the volume

of the unit cell. In both cases, spin-orbit coupling is included and the Fermi energy is set to zero.

The size of red dots along the A-Γ is proportional to the relative ratio of s orbitals from Zn and

Bi atoms. At the Γ point, four low-energy states are labelled by their representations. The inset

in (a) shows the band structure near the Γ point. In (b), the 3D Dirac point is pointed out by the

green arrow.

5

On the other hand, the relative positions of the four energy levels are very sensitive to

strain.

If the lattice constant c is enlarged and a is reduced, the band order changes as

shown in Fig. 2 (b) with the new lattice constants presented in the caption. Compared

to those in Fig. 2 (a), the relative positions of Γ7 (p) and Γ8 are exchanged. As the p-d

hybridization here mainly involves pz orbital from Bi atoms, the increased lattice constant

along the z direction weakens this eﬀect. So Γ7 (p) falls below Γ9. At the same time, Γ8 is

pushed above Γ9. It is reasonable because for Zn-Bi interactions, the bonding feature along

z direction is found in Γ8, similar to the case of LiZnSb21. Accompanied by the change of

band order near the Γ point, a global gap at the Γ-K-M plane emerges. The band inversion

between Γ7 (s) and Γ9 is found to be topologically nontrivial from the calculated Z2 index

at the Γ-K-M plane23 (shown in Appendix A). The crossing at (0,0,kD

z ), pointed by the

green arrow in Fig. 2(b), is protected by C6v symmetry and the band dispersions around

the crossing point are linear in all momentum directions, leading to a 3D Dirac semimetal.

Time-reversal symmetry ensures that the same crossing (Dirac point) also occurs at (0,0,-

kD
z ). Therefore, LiZnBi in the strained structure is a Dirac semimetal with a pair of Dirac

points near the Fermi level.

To further conﬁrm its nontrivial topological nature, we calculate the surface states on
(001) and (100) surfaces. Figure 3 (a) shows surface states on (001) surface along eK-eΓ- fM.
Near the eΓ point, the linear Dirac cone is from the band dispersion in the x-y plane of the
3D Dirac cones. The two bulk Dirac points are projected onto the eΓ point in the constant

energy contour (see Fig. 3 (c)). For the (100) surface, the band dispersion along the z

direction of the 3D Dirac cones is projected onto Γ-Z and the nontrivial surface states along

the Y -Γ is consistent with the nonzero Z2 index at the Γ-K-M plane (see Fig. 3 (b)). But

as k moves from Γ to Z, the band inversion decreases and ﬁnally disappears at the projected

Dirac points. Correspondingly, the nontrivial surface states exist only within two 3D Dirac

points and merge into bulk states beyond that region. As shown in Fig. 3 (d), both the

Fermi arcs contributed by the surface states connect the two projected Dirac points and

vanish elsewhere, manifesting themselves as a signature of nontrivial topology.

Inspired by the change of band order in Fig. 2 (b), we further explore the phase boundary

of Dirac semimetal by studying the low-energy states under diﬀerent strain conﬁgurations.

As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the eﬀective spin-orbit coupling strength ∆SOC = E[Γ9]−E[Γ7 (p)] is

inclined to turn positive as a decreases or c increases, which may give rise to the appearance

of Dirac semimetal phase. Either the smaller in-plane lattice constant a or the larger out-

of-plane lattice constant c can weaken the tetrahetral crystal ﬁeld splitting of d orbitals of

Zn and lower the energy levels of t2g orbitals, which plays an important role in the negative

eﬀective spin-orbit coupling22. Moreover, Γ7 (p), mainly consisting of the anti-bonding state

of pz orbitals from Bi atoms and the shallow d orbitals from Zn atoms, gets even lower as the

increasing c reduces the bond strength. This trend is consistent with the results shown in Fig.

2 where the strained LiZnBi has been proved to be in Dirac semimetal phase. However, since

the existence of other low-energy states can aﬀect the occupation of bands, the band order

E[Γ9] > E[Γ7 (p)] itself doesn’t ensure the Dirac semimetal phase. In Fig. 4 (b), we present

the phase boundary of Dirac semimetal (indicated by a black dotted line), which corresponds

to zero points of min{E[Γ8], E[Γ9]} − max{E[Γ7 (p)], E[Γ7 (s)]}. It is reasonable because we

ﬁnd that Γ8 is always higher than Γ7 (s) near the gap closing point (E[Γ9] − E[Γ7 (p)] ≈ 0).

In fact, various phases can be realized in LiZnBi under diﬀerent strain conﬁgurations. For

example, according to our calculations at a = 0.97a0 and c = 0.98c0 (shown in Appendix

7

phase is in the region where min{E[Γ8], E[Γ9]}−max{E[Γ7 (p)], E[Γ7 (s)]} is positive. The phase

boundary is shown by the black dotted line. The atomic coordinates are relaxed before electronic

structure calculations in all cases.

B), the strained LiZnBi becomes a conventional semiconductor, suggesting that a strain can

induce topological phase transition in LiZnBi.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, our ﬁrst-principles calculations indicate that LiZnBi is a 3D Dirac semimetal

when both in-plane compressive strain and out-of-plane tenssile strain are applied. We ﬁnd

that there exists band inversion in LiZnBi in both the unstrained and strained structures.

But only when a proper strain is applied, the band order changes at the Γ point and the

band inversion can give rise to nontrivial topology, which is conﬁrmed by the nonzero Z2

index. Surface states of the strained LiZnBi are also calculated and Fermi arcs are observed

on the (100) surface, connecting the two projected Dirac points. Furthermore, we show the

phase boundary of Dirac semimetal phase under diﬀerent strain conﬁgurations. Importantly,

the critical strain of driving LiZnBi into Dirac semimetal is small and may be realized in

8

experiments by epitaxial growth on proper substrates. For instance, LiZnSb in wurtzite

structure can be a good choice for its similar lattice constants and chemical components20.

Our results enrich the topological phases that hexagonal ABC compounds can host and

consequently broaden their application potentials.

Appendix A: Z2 index of the strained LiZnBi in Dirac semimetal phase

Besides the discussion of band inversion shown in Fig. 2 (b), the evaluation of the Z2

index can directly prove the nontrivial topology in the strained LiZnBi. Since the inversion

symmetry is absent, its Z2 index at Γ-M-K plane is determined by calculating the Wannier

Charge Centers (WCCs). The results are shown in Fig. A.1. The total number of WCC

bands which the gap center jumps over is seven. It is odd, conﬁrming the nonzero Z2 index

in the strained LiZnBi.

Appendix B: Topological phase transition in strained LiZnBi

To drive the topological phase transition from 3D Dirac semimetal to convention semicon-

ductor, both Γ8 and Γ7 (s) should be in the conduction bands. Since there is anti-bonding

feature in basal plane (along z direction) for Γ8 (Γ7 (s)), decreasing a and c at the same time

can push up these two energy levels. In fact, when a = 0.97a0 and c = 0.98c0, we indeed

acquire a global gap across the ﬁrst Brillouin zone and the band structure near the Γ point

is shown in Fig. B.1 (a). In order to calculate the Z2 index, the WCCs along the Γ-M line

at the Γ-M-K plane are calculated and presented in Fig. B.1 (b). The gap center (red dots)

cross 6 WCC bands in total as k moves from Γ to M. Since the crossing number is even,

the Z2 index equals zero and the strained LiZnBi is topologically trivial.
