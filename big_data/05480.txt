The properties of AMO3 perovskite oxides, where M is a 3d transition metal,

depend strongly on the level of covalency between the metal d and oxygen p orbitals.

With their complex spin orders and metal-insulator transition, rare-earth nickelates

verge between dominantly ionic and covalent characters. Accordingly, the nature of

their ground state is highly debated. Here, we reconcile the ionic and covalent visions

of the insulating state of nickelates. Through Ô¨Årst-principles calculations, we show

that it is reminiscent of the ionic charge disproportionation picture (with strictly

low-spin 4+ and high-spin 2+ Ni sites) while exhibiting strong covalence eÔ¨Äects with

oxygen electrons shifted toward the depleted Ni cations, mimicking a conÔ¨Åguration

with identical Ni sites. Our results further hint at strategies to control electronic

and magnetic phases of transition metal oxide perovskites.

Transition metal oxides with an AMO3 perovskite structure have attracted widespread

interest over the last decades, both from academic and industrial points of view. This can

be ascribed to their wide range of functionalities that originates from the interplay between

lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom [1]. Among all perovskites, rare-earth

nickelates R3+Ni3+O3 (R=Lu-La, Y) might be considered as a prototypical case because

they posses almost all possible degrees of freedom present in these materials. Nickelates

were intensively studied during the nineties [2, 3] and have regained interest in the few last

years due to their great potential for engineering novel electronic and magnetic states [4‚Äì11].

Except for R=La, all rare-earth nickelates undergo a metal-insulator phase transition

(MIT) at a temperature TMI, accompanied by a symmetry lowering from P bnm to P 21/n [2,

3]. In this P 21/n phase, a Ni-site splitting is observed; this is usually associated with the
appearance of charge disproportionation [12‚Äì14] from 2Ni3+ to Ni(3+Œ¥)+ + Ni(3‚àíŒ¥)+ and/or
a breathing distortion of O6 octahedra that leads to a rock-salt-like pattern of small and
large NiO6 groups [13]. At TN ‚â§ TMI, nickelates undergo an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
phase transition yielding a quadrupling of the magnetic unit cell ((cid:126)k=( 1
2) with respect
to the P bnm primitive cell) and possible collinear or non collinear spin orderings [15‚Äì18].

The electronic structure is also characterized by strong overlaps between O-2p and Ni-3d

states leading to large covalent eÔ¨Äects [2]. As a consequence, external stimuli, such as

temperature, or chemical or hydrostatic pressure, can modify the electronic bandwidth and

inÔ¨Çuence the MIT [19‚Äì22]. EÔ¨Äorts have thus been devoted to search for novel electronic

phases in nickelates, mainly using strain engineering or conÔ¨Ånement [10, 11, 23‚Äì25].

In spite of all these research eÔ¨Äorts, the structural, electronic and magnetic properties

of the bulk ground state are still under debate. This can be ascribed to the scarcity of

systematic bulk studies, from both the experimental and theoretical sides. On one hand,

bulk nickelates are hard to synthesize and mainly thin Ô¨Ålms have been studied [3]. On the

other hand, no theoretical systematic studies have been performed due to the diÔ¨Éculty of

reproducing the RNiO3 ground state using density functional theory (DFT). In the context

of DFT-based calculations, the choice of the Hubbard U correction for Ni-3d levels remains

ambiguous;

indeed, a great diversity of values, ranging from very weak to quite strong

corrections, have been proposed and argued for in diÔ¨Äerent works [5, 24, 26‚Äì29]. Moreover,

the identiÔ¨Åed ground state is usually ferromagnetic [24, 26, 30], in contrast to the established

antiferromagnetic ordering.

cations are not displayed for clarity. The dashed lines represent the size of the crystallographic

unit cell.

Here we performed a systematic study of various representative nickelates using the stan-

dard DFT+U formalism. We Ô¨Ånd that a small Coulombian correction on Ni-3d states is

appropriate to reproduce the key ground state properties of these compounds. We then use

this theory to discuss the electronic ground state of the nickelates, revealing the co-existence

of ionic (Ni electronic states featuring a complete and strict charge disproportionation) and

covalent (oxygen-p electrons shared with the charge-depleted Ni cations) features, and pro-

viding an uniÔ¨Åed picture of these materials that is easy to reconcile with existing (and

apparently conÔ¨Çicting) proposals in the literature. Finally, we unveil a new pathway to

control electronic and magnetic phases in perovskites by tuning the level of covalency.

RESULTS

Structural properties

First, we performed full geometry relaxations considering 80-atom supercells of both

possible P bnm and P 21/n structures with diÔ¨Äerent magnetic orderings: ferromagnetic (FM)
as well as complex E-, S-, and T-type AFM orderings [5] based on ‚Üë‚Üë‚Üì‚Üì spin chains in
the (ab)-plane with diÔ¨Äerent stackings along the (cid:126)c axis (see Figures 1.a, b and c). We

employed the PBEsol functional [31] in combination with a U correction [32] of 2 eV on

Ni-3d states in order to account for electronic correlations. Several nickelates (R=Y, Dy,

Tb, Gd, Eu, Sm, Nd, and Pr) were considered, covering the phase diagram as a function

of rare-earth radius. All nickelates relax to a P 21/n insulating ground state with complex

antiferromagnetic structures (S- or T-type depending on the rare-earth) and band gaps

compatible with experiments [33, 34] (see Table I). All our P bnm phases favor a metallic

FM solution [35]. We checked the reliability of our DFT+U calculations by changing the U

correction to either 0 eV or 5 eV in SmNiO3. While the ground state is unchanged when no

U-correction is applied [36], imposing U = 5 eV yields a P 21/n ferromagnetic and insulating
solution that is much more stable than the considered complex AFM orderings (‚àÜE (cid:39) 160
meV per 80-atom unit cell). This further supports our choice of a relatively small Hubbard

correction for the Ni-3d electrons.

Our optimized ground state structures are characterized by three main lattice distortions.

First, they feature two antiferrodistortive (AFD) modes that can be described, respectively,
as a‚àía‚àíc0 and a0a0c+ patterns using Glazer‚Äôs notation [37]. These AFD modes are the

main features of the phase with P bnm symmetry. Second, we have a breathing of the O6

octahedra, Boc (see Figures 2.a, b and c). The breathing mode only appears in the P 21/n

symmetry and produces a rock-salt pattern of small and large NiO6 groups, automatically

resulting in two diÔ¨Äerent Ni sites (see Figure 2.c). In the following we will use the nota-

tion NiS and NiL to refer to the Ni cations belonging to the small and large NiO6 groups,

respectively.

As usual in perovskites, the magnitude of the metal-oxygen-metal bond angles associated

with the O6 rotations is governed by steric eÔ¨Äects (see Figures 2.d and e), and nickelates

with low tolerance factors (i.e., smaller R cations) [38] are more distorted. The alternating

expansion/contraction pattern of the oxygen cage associated with the Boc breathing also

appears to be modulated by the rare earth (see Figure 2.f), as smaller R cations yield larger

distortions. Finally, we observe a Jahn-Teller distortion in the ground state that is one to

two orders of magnitude smaller than the breathing mode or the two AFD motions. Hence,

the relaxed structures indicate that there is no signiÔ¨Åcant orbital order in these systems,

although the 3d7 t6

is nominally Jahn-Teller active [28].

The electronic structure of the optimized ground states is characterized by strong hy-

bridizations between O-2p and Ni-3d levels, as inferred from the projected density of states

(pDOS, see Figure 3.a for the representative case of SmNiO3). Comparing the pDOS corre-

sponding to the 3d levels of the two diÔ¨Äerent Ni sub-lattices reveals some small diÔ¨Äerences,

likely reÔ¨Çecting weak disproportionation eÔ¨Äects and a small charge ordering (see Figure 3.b).

Although atomic charges are not uniquely deÔ¨Åned in DFT calculations [39], sphere integra-

tions around the Ni cations can provide some insight into the possible charge ordering.

Figure 3.c reports the occupancy of both Ni sites as a function of the rare earth. A weak

and rather constant charge ordering is observed between the Ni sites, going from Œ¥=0.13

(YNiO3) to Œ¥=0.11 (PrNiO3), but the sign of Œ¥ is opposite to what is expected. Indeed, the

NiS cations, sitting at the center of the smallest O6 octahedra, appear to hold more electrons

than the NiL cations, located in the largest oxygen cages. Since the breathing mode Boc

enhances the crystal Ô¨Åeld splitting at the small NiO6 groups, the eg levels of NiS lie higher

in energy than those of NiL [28, 40] and therefore NiS should have fewer electrons than NiL

associated to it.

Let us now consider better deÔ¨Åned ‚Äì and experimentally measurable ‚Äì quantities, such

as Born eÔ¨Äective charges (BECs) that measure the amount of charge displaced upon the

movement of individual atoms. Figure 3.d reports the average of the diagonal components

of the tensor for the diÔ¨Äerent nickelates (see the Supplementary Material for the full ten-
sors). In the representative case of SmNiO3, we obtain ZNiL ‚âà +2.5, which is not far from
the nominal oxidation state of 2+ that this Ni site is associated with in the complete-charge-
disproportionation picture. However, we Ô¨Ånd a similar ZNiS ‚âà +2.1, which sharply deviates
from the expectation value (4+) in the charge-disproportionation picture. As shown in

Figure 3.d, we observe the same behavior across the various studied compounds; an approx-

imately constant diÔ¨Äerence of Born charges, of about 0.4 electrons, is found across the whole

series. Hence, from the point of view of the eÔ¨Äective charges, the two Ni sites behave in

a rather similar fashion, the disproportionation eÔ¨Äects being weak and not complying with

the usual picture.

However, our computed magnetic moments on both Ni sites appear to be in contradiction

with the conclusion of the charge analysis. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3.e, we observe a

large diÔ¨Äerence between NiL ‚Äì with a moment larger than 1 ¬µB ‚Äì and NiS ‚Äì for which the

magnetic moment is null ‚Äì, which suggests two very diÔ¨Äerent electronic states.

Wannier analysis

The conclusion of the previous discussion is that, in the RNiO3 compounds, all Ni atoms

seem to display a similar oxidation state. Yet, the presence of a signiÔ¨Åcant breathing dis-

tortion, and of the drastic diÔ¨Äerence in the local magnetic moments, clearly suggest two

markedly diÔ¨Äerent electronic states. Note that similar results have been reported in previ-

ous theoretical works using a variety of methods [25, 26, 30], but in our opinion a convincing

explanation for this apparent contradiction is still missing. Here we ran a Wannier function

(WF) analysis of our Ô¨Årst-principles results, which allowed us to resolve this pending issue.

We used the Wannier90 package [41‚Äì43] to determine the maximally-localized WFs that

reproduce the occupied electronic manifold. More precisely, our purpose was to count how

many occupied WFs are centered at the diÔ¨Äerent Ni cations, and how many at the sur-

rounding oxygen anions, and to characterize them. Further, we wanted to run our analysis

without having to make any assumption on the precise character of the occupied Ni and O

orbitals, which complicated the choice of the seed functions that are needed for an eÔ¨Écient

maximal-localization calculation. Nevertheless, we found the following robust strategy to

proceed. We considered the whole occupied manifold and sought to extract from it (i.e., to
disentangle) a set of 2√ó(144+10) WF functions, where 2√ó144 = 2√ó3√ó48 is the total num-
ber of O-2p orbitals available in our 80-atom supercell and 2√ó10 = 2√ó5√ó2 is the number
of Ni-3d orbitals corresponding to two speciÔ¨Åc Ni atoms. (Note that we ran separate WF

optimizations for the spin-up and spin-down channels.) Hence, for our initial WF seeds,

we used 3 generic p orbitals centered at each of the O anions in our cell, and 5 generic d

orbitals centered at two neighboring Ni cations; this couple of Ni cations were chosen to be

Ô¨Årst-nearest neighbors, so that we considered one NiL and one NiS. The basic qualitative

results of this optimization were the same for all the nickelates considered, and thus the

following discussion is not compound speciÔ¨Åc.

Our optimization renders 2√ó3 WFs centered at each oxygen anion (i.e., 3 spin-up WFs
and 3 ‚Äì very similar ‚Äì spin-down WFs), suggesting that all oxygens in our nickelates are
in a 2‚àí oxidation state. The oxygen-centered WFs have a clear p character, as can be

9

appreciated in Figures 4.c and d. We also obtained 2√ó3 t2g-like WFs centered at each of
the two considered Ni atoms, indicating that the t2g states are fully occupied and there

is no magnetic moment associated to them. Further, we obtained 2 eg-like spin-up WFs

centered at the NiL site (see Figures 4.a and b), indicating that this cation is in a 2+

oxydation state and has a signiÔ¨Åcant magnetic moment associated to it. Finally, as regards
the other seed functions centered at the chosen NiL (2 spin-down d orbitals) and NiS (2√ó2 d
orbitals) atoms, they did not lead to any WF centered at those sites. Instead, the maximal-

localization procedure resulted in WFs centered at Ni and R cations in the vicinity of the

considered NiL‚ÄìNiS pair. Thus, in particular, it was impossible to localize any eg-like WFs at

a NiS site, which strongly indicates that these Ni cations are in a 4+ oxidation state. These

conclusions were ratiÔ¨Åed by considering larger clusters of Ni sites for the WF optimization,

as well as individual Ni‚Äôs and/or optimizations in which the oxygen bands were not included.

Hence, the Wannier analysis yields a picture of strong charge disproportionation between

the Ni sites, which is clearly at odds with the quantitatively similar behavior discussed in

the section above. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we need to inspect in more detail

the obtained oxygen-centered WFs.

Figures 4.c and d report representative results, for SmNiO3, of the O-2p-like Wannier

functions oriented along the Ni‚ÄìO‚ÄìNi bonds. As it is clearly visible in the Ô¨Ågures for both

spin channels, these WFs have their centers signiÔ¨Åcantly shifted towards the NiS cations

and away from the NiL sites. The shift ‚Äì as quantiÔ¨Åed by the distance between the oxygen
position and WF center ‚Äì is ‚àº 0.231 ÀöA in average. Hence, while the NiS cations appear
to be in a 4+ state when we count how many WFs are centered at them, they also receive

a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of electrons coming from the surrounding oxygens, with which they

are strongly hybridized. Hence, this is the explanation why quantititative measures of the

charge around the NiS ions renders results that are similar to those of the NiL and suggest

valence state much more reduced than the expected 4+. Across the series, we observe that

O-2p centers get closer to the NiS cations for smaller rare earths, increasing the localization

of the charge on NiS. Additionally, the O-2p WFs behave similarly irrespective of their spin

polarization, so that their shifting does not result in any magnetic moment at the NiS sites.

The Wannier analysis therefore leads to the conclusion that a full disproportionation

occurs in the system, with clearly distinct Ni4+
S

(low-spin, non-magnetic) and Ni2+
L

(high-

spin, magnetic) sites. Simultaneously, the O-2p WFs approach the Ni4+
S

sites, ultimately

yielding NiS and NiL that are nearly equivalent from the point of view of the charge (static

and dynamics) around them.

10

DISCUSSION

Our results thus appear to be compatible with the disproportionation eÔ¨Äects originally

proposed to occur at the MIT [12‚Äì14]. While for a long time the nickelates were believed to

possess an orthorhombic P bnm symmetry in the insulating phase [2], it is now established

that they adopt a monoclinic P 21/n phase at low temperatures [12, 13]. This phase exhibits

a breathing distortion whose magnitude decreases with increasing the tolerance factor of the

perovskite [13], concomitantly accompanied by a charge disproportionation Œ¥ between the
two Ni sites, leading to a Ni(3+Œ¥)+

conÔ¨Åguration [14]. Our results are reminiscent

S

+Ni(3‚àíŒ¥)+

L

of this picture, with the observation of a subsequent breathing distortion modulated by the

rare earth and a charge disproportionation between Ni sites.

Nevertheless, they are also compatible with the model of Mizokawa et al [44], as well

as with recent Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) studies [29, 30, 45‚Äì47], proposing a

ligand-hole structure in rare-earth nickelates. Indeed, our Wannier analysis indicates that

we have a 3d8 electronic conÔ¨Åguration for the NiL cations. More importantly, it is also
compatible with the 3d8L2 conÔ¨Åguration proposed for the NiS sites. More precisely, the
notation L2 stands for the two oxygen holes that are shared by the oxygens in the O6

octahedron surrounding a NiS cation. According to our Wannier analysis, such a situation

would correspond to having all six oxygens around NiS sharing the 2p electrons that occupy

orbitals along the Ni‚ÄìO‚ÄìNi bonds. Further, given that our integrated and dynamical Born

charges suggest that the NiS and NiL sites host a similar number of electrons, our results do

in fact point to a situation in which each O6 cage shares approximately two electrons with

the NiS at its center, exactly as in the ligand-hole picture.

As regards the magnetic moments at the diÔ¨Äerent Ni sites, our results are also clear and

compatible with both proposed pictures: NiL bears a magnetic moment approaching 2 ¬µB,
as it corresponds to having Ni2+ in a high-spin conÔ¨Åguration. Then, NiS has no magnetic
moment associated to it, as it would correspond to a nominal Ni4+ low-spin conÔ¨Åguration.

The latter result is partly a consequence of the fact that the oxygen‚ÄìNiS shared electrons

are spin paired, which can be interpreted as a ligand-hole screening.

11

Our Ô¨Årst-principles calculations therefore reconcile the two visions proposed to occur

in the ground state of rare-earth nickelates. The electronic structure is summarized in

Figure 4.e and is based on having i) a full charge disproportionation between NiL and

NiS sites accompanied by a breathing mode and ii) 2 electrons from surrounding oxygens
shared with the depleted NiS site, leaving the impression of two similar Ni2+ sites in the

system. Finally, this electronic structure lifts the orbital degeneracy appearing in the high

temperature phase and is compatible with the small Jahn-Teller distortion observed in our

computed ground states.

Although the electronic structure is similar between all nickelates, the rare-earth cation

does have an impact on the level of covalency of the system through their induced lattice

distortions. An example is their inÔ¨Çuence on the magnetic moment of the NiL cations. Note

that our computed NiL magnetic moments are always far from the nominal value of 2¬µB,

as a consequence of the the hybridization between Ni-3d and O-2p states. This can be seen

in Figures 4.c and d where slightly larger overlaps between O-2p orbitals over the NiL site

arise in the spin up channel (this NiL site has a net spin up). From Figure 3.e, the level

of covalency clearly increases with the tolerance factor (a ferromagnetic calculation yields

similar conclusion, see Supplementary Material). This is further conÔ¨Årmed by the increase

of the average BECs on both NiS and NiL following their interprettion of such eÔ¨Äects in

other perovskite oxides [48]. We also observe increasing O-2p overlaps with NiL sites going

from R=Y to Pr.

The level of covalency seems to correlate with the stability of the magnetic ordering and

the insulating phase (see Table I). On one hand, with increasing covalency, the energy dif-

ference between the AFM (S or T) and FM solutions increases strongly. On the other hand,

the insulating gap decreases. In order to further corroborate these trends, we performed ad-
ditional calculations on SmNiO3 by applying a hydrostatic pressure of ¬±8% on the ground
state volume and relaxed the atomic positions for each magnetic ordering. Under compres-

sion, we Ô¨Ånd a sizable enhancement of the covalent character as ¬µNiL decreases to 1.103 ¬µB.

The stability of the S-AFM ordering with respect to the FM solution is therefore doubled

(‚àÜE=-293 meV per 80-atom cell). Eventually, the band gap is decreased by 0.11 eV with

respect to the ground state value. Under expansion, we observe a weakening of the covalent

character of the system with ¬µNiL increasing to 1.308 ¬µB; simultaneously, the stability of

the complex AFM ordering is roughly reduced by a factor of 2 (‚àÜE =-67 meV per 80-atom

Finally, the rare-earth atom is known to play key role in the nature of the MIT. Experi-

mentally it is observed that TMI is diÔ¨Äerent from the magnetic-ordering transition tempera-

ture TN for all nickelates except for those in which the rare earth is Pr or Nd. Interestingly,

our calculations reÔ¨Çect this diÔ¨Äerentiated behavior. As already mentioned, we obtain an

insulating solution for the AFM monoclinic ground state of all considered nickelates. Then,

when we consider the P 21/n structure with a ferromagnetic spin arrangement, we also ob-

tain an insulating phase for all R cations ranging from Y to Sm; the corresponding band

gaps range from 77 to 41 meV and we observe a relatively large energy gain with respect to

the orthorhombic phase (see Figures 5.a and b). Thus, the breathing distortion and dispro-

portionation eÔ¨Äects seem suÔ¨Écient to open the band gap in these compounds, irrespective

of the spin arrangement. As a consequence, our results indicate that these nickelates can

potentially present an insulating, spin-disordered phase, as they indeed do experimentally.

In contrast, for the monoclinic phase of NdNiO3 and PrNiO3, the FM spin conÔ¨Åguration is

found to be metallic; further, the stability of the low-symmetry strucure with respect to the

orthorhombic one drastically decreases. The complex antiferromagnetic ordering therefore

appears to be a necessary condition for the MIT to occur in these two compounds.

Considering the case of SmNiO3 under 8% of compression, we unveil a similar behaviour

to bulk PrNiO3 and NdNiO3, since the level of covalency increases. These results suggest

that it is possible to control of the electronic and magnetic structures of these compounds

by tuning the level of covalency in the system. We also emphasize that these observations

again support our choice of a small Hubbard U correction on Ni-3d sites and demonstrate

that DFT+U methods can capture the key physical properties of correlated systems.

In summary, we have used Ô¨Årst-principles methods to investigate the ground state elec-

tronic structure of rare-earth nickelates. Our DFT simulations using a small Hubbard cor-

rection on Ni-3d states reproduce all features reported from experiments (insulating charac-

ter, disproportionation eÔ¨Äects, covalency, complex antiferromagnetic structures, structural

trends). In particular, we show that the insulating phase is characterized by a clear-cut split

of the electronic states of the two Ni sites, which can be strictly described as being low-spin

4+ and high-spin 2+. At the same time, our simulations reveal a shift of the oxygen-p

orbitals toward the depleted Ni cations, so that, ultimately, from the point of view of the

integrated charge, the two Ni sites appear to be nearly identical. These Ô¨Åndings are clearly

reminiscent of the various pictures proposed in the literature to explain the ground state of

these compounds, which can thus be reconciled according to our results. Finally, we unveil

that a control of the level of covalency between oxygens and transition metal ions provides

an alternative pathway to tune the electronic and magnetic phases in late transition-metal

oxide perovskites.

METHODS

First-principles calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Pack-

age (VASP) package [49, 50]. Magnetism was treated only at the collinear level. We used a
3√ó6√ó2 Œì-centered K-point mesh. The cut-oÔ¨Ä was set to 500 eV. We used PAW pseudopo-
tentials [51] with the following electron conÔ¨Ågurations: 4s23d8 (Ni), 2s22p4 (O), 4s24p65s24d1

(Y), 4s24p65s24f1 (Pr, Nd, Sm), 4p65s24f1 (Gd, Eu, Tb, Dy). We did not treat explicitly the

f electrons as they order at very low temperature [52] and they were included in the pseu-

dopotential. Full geometry relaxations were performed until forces were lower than 0.001
eV/ÀöA and energy was converged to 1√ó10‚àí7 eV. Born EÔ¨Äective Charges were computed
using density functional perturbation theory [53]. Symmetry adapted modes allowing the

extraction of lattice distortion amplitudes were performed using the Bilbao crystallographic

server [54, 55]. The results presented in Figures 2.d, e and f have been obtained by freezing

single lattice distortion in a cubic reference that has the same lattice parameters for all

reported compounds. This allows to extract quantities that are strain independent for all

nickelates. Wannier functions reported in Figures 4.a and b are plotted for isosurfaces equal

to 2. Wannier functions reported in Figures 4.c and d are plotted for isosurfaces equal to 9.
