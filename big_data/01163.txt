ABSTRACT

Aims.Observations of 28SiO v=0 J=1−0 line emission (7-mm wavelength) from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars show in some
cases peculiar proﬁles, composed of a central intense component plus a wider plateau. Very similar proﬁles have been observed in
CO lines from some AGB stars and most post-AGB nebulae and, in these cases, they are clearly associated with the presence of
conspicuous axial symmetry and bipolar dynamics. We aim to systematically study the proﬁle shape of 28SiO v=0 J=1−0 lines in
evolved stars and to discuss the origin of the composite proﬁle structure.
Methods. We present observations of 28SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission in 28 evolved stars, including O-rich, C-rich, and S-type Mira-type
variables, OH/IR stars, semiregular long-period variables, red supergiants and one yellow hypergiant. Most objects were observed in
several epochs, over a total period of time of one and a half years. The observations were performed with the 40 m radio telescope of
the Instituto Geográﬁco Nacional (IGN) in Yebes, Spain.
Results. We ﬁnd that the composite core plus plateau proﬁles are systematically present in O-rich Miras, OH/IR stars, and red
supergiants. They are also found in one S-type Mira (χ Cyg) and in two semiregular variables (X Her and RS Cnc) that are known
to show axial symmetry. In the other objects, the proﬁles are simpler and similar to those observed in other molecular lines. The
composite structure appears in the objects in which SiO emission is thought to come from the very inner circumstellar layers, prior to
dust formation. The central spectral feature is found to be systematically composed of a number of narrow spikes, except for X Her
and RS Cnc, in which it shows a smooth shape that is very similar to that observed in CO emission. These spikes show a signiﬁcant
(and mostly chaotic) time variation, while in all cases the smooth components remain constant within the uncertainties. The proﬁle
shape could come from the superposition of standard wide proﬁles and a group of weak maser spikes conﬁned to the central spectral
regions because of tangential ampliﬁcation. Alternatively, we speculate that the very similar proﬁles detected in objects that are known
to be conspicuously axisymmetric, such as X Her and RS Cnc, and in O-rich Mira-type stars, such as IK Tau and TX Cam, may be
indicative of the systematic presence of a signiﬁcant axial symmetry in the very inner circumstellar shells around AGB stars; such
symmetry would be independent of the presence of weak maser eﬀects in the central spikes.

1. Introduction

SiO rotational line emission is often detected in evolved stars.
These lines are particularly intense in O-rich Asymptotic Giant
Branch (AGB) circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), but they are also
detected in C-rich objects and other evolved stars. The low-J vi-
brationally excited (v≥1) lines present intense maser emission in
AGB stars, particularly in O-rich Mira-type variables (Buhl et al.
1974; Bujarrabal et al. 1987; Alcolea et al. 1990; Jewell et al.
1991; Deguchi et al. 2010; Cho & Kim 2012, etc.). Their proﬁles
present some narrow spikes, distributed over a spectral band of
a few km s−1. The maser emitting region is very small, consist-
ing of a number of spots in a ring-like structure with a radius of
few stellar radii that are centered on the star (e.g. Diamond et al.
1994; Gonidakis et al. 2013; Desmurs et al. 2014), this structure
is due to the dominant tangential ampliﬁcation. The variability
of these masers is very strong and, at least in regular pulsators,
tightly follows the stellar IR variability cycle (similar to the op-
tical variability cycle, but with a phase shift of about 0.1–0.2);
see e.g. Pardo et al. (2004).

The v=0 J=2−1 and higher-J lines have also been observed
in AGB and post-AGB CSEs. It seems to be a typical thermal
emission, which is much weaker than the v>0 masers and shows
wider proﬁles that are more or less comparable to those ob-
served in lines of other standard molecules, such as CO, HCN,
etc. (e.g. González Delgado et al. 2003; Bujarrabal et al. 1989;
Schöier et al. 2011). In O-rich AGB stars, the v=0 J=2−1 line
probably originates in very inner shells, within about 1015 cm,
as shown by interferometric maps (Lucas et al. 1992), see also
González Delgado et al. (2003). In this region, grains are still
being formed and the velocity gradient is still noticeable, which
explains the presence of silicon in the gas, not yet fully locked
into grains, as well as the observed triangular line proﬁles (e.g.
Bujarrabal et al. 1989). On the contrary in C-rich AGB stars this
line seems to come from more extended shells and the proﬁles
are very similar to those of the standard molecules arising from
the bulk of the envelope.

The v=0 rotational lines of the rare isotopes, 29SiO and
30SiO, sometimes present spiky proﬁles that are attributed to

maser emission. These lines are weaker than 28SiO v>0 masers,
but are stronger than the 28SiO v=0 lines (Alcolea & Bujarrabal
1992).

The 28SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission from evolved stars, at 7-
mm wavelength, has been scarcely studied so far, since it is
relatively weaker than the v>0 masers. In some objects, it was
found to show very peculiar composite proﬁles (Jewell et al.
1991) with a wide and smooth plateau and a central spiky com-
ponent that was proposed to be due to weak maser emission
(Boboltz & Claussen 2004). Remarkably, similar composite pro-
ﬁles have been observed in standard thermal lines, particularly
in CO, coming from a rare class of objects, most of which
are semiregular variables; see Knapp et al. (1998), Libert et al.
(2010) and Castro-Carrizo et al. (2010). In contrast to the case
of the majority of AGB shells, in these objects the whole cir-
cumstellar envelope is strongly axisymmetric; it is an hourglass-
like structure that consists of a slowly expanding equatorial disk
∼ 5 km s−1) that is responsible for the central spectral fea-
(at <
ture, plus a somewhat faster bipolar outﬂow (expanding at ∼
10 km s−1). The axial structure and line proﬁles found in these
semiregular stars is very similar to what is typical of young plan-
etary and protoplanetary nebulae ( PNe, PPNe; see CO emis-
sion data in e.g. Bujarrabal et al. 2001; Alcolea et al. 2007) al-
though in post-AGB nebulae the involved velocities are signif-
icantly higher. The mechanism responsible for the spectacular
evolution from AGB CSEs to form PPNe and PNe is still un-
der debate. It is thought to involve the eﬀects of a companion on
the inner circumstellar regions (see Blackman & Lucchini 2014,
and references therein). In this scenario, the companion should
also aﬀect (at least) the inner shells in the AGB phase, yielding
some kind of axisymmetric structure. In some objects, binarity is
known to yield a large-scale axial symmetry in AGB CSEs (e.g.
Ramstedt et al. 2014), which seems to be the case for the above
mentioned semiregular variables but certainly not for most AGB
stars.

In this paper, we present a wide survey of 28SiO v=0 J=1−0
emission from evolved stars of diﬀerent kinds which also in-
cludes observations in diﬀerent epochs of a number of sources;
we show that such composite proﬁles systematically appear in
O-rich and S-type sources. We will suggest that the 28SiO v=0
line in O-rich AGB stars is formed, as the other SiO lines, in
very inner circumstellar shells, and that the observed composite
proﬁles may reﬂect the systematically axisymmetric structure of
these regions, although at large scales such eﬀects would in some
way disappear or be more diﬃcult to detect.

2. Observations

The observations were performed with the 40 m radio telescope,
operated by the National Geographic Institute (IGN) in Yebes
Observatory (Spain). The telescope is located at 40◦ 31′ 28′′.78
north, 03◦ 05′ 12′′.71 west and 980 m above sea level. Weather
conditions are typically dry; the amount of precipitable water
toward the zenith ranges between 4 mm in winter to 14 mm in
summer. The antenna has an homological design and operates
in Nasmyth focus. The primary mirror backstructure is covered
with a cladding and has a forced air ﬂow to keep the temperature
homogeneous, but since it is not hermetically isolated from the
outside and temperature controlled, it suﬀers some astigmatism
when temperature along the day changes more than 10 degrees.
This has a relevant eﬀect at frequencies above 70 GHz. The Half
Power Beam Width (HPBW) at 43 GHz is 44 arcsecs.

The antenna is equipped with a dual-polarization (LCP and
RCP) single-pixel 45 GHz cryogenic receiver mounted in a Nas-

myth focus. During the observations described in this paper the
receiver was upgraded and its location moved to a new position
in the Nasmyth cabin. Observations from the ﬁrst epoch, those
performed in 2013 and 2014, have a higher receiver noise tem-
perature than those in the second epoch. Since the beginning of
2015 the receiver was improved and the system noise tempera-
ture dropped approximately by 30 K in both polarization chan-
nels, to about 90 K.

Calibration at 43 GHz is carried out using the chopper wheel
method. A hot load at ambient temperature and the sky as cold
load were used to calibrate the data. Opacity was estimated the-
oretically using the ATM code (Pardo et al. 2001, 2002) and
weather conditions measured at a metereological station 400 m
away from the antenna. The error in the determination of the
sky opacity was estimated comparing the results from ATM with
those obtained from skydip measurements, from which the for-
ward eﬃciency of the antenna (90%) was also estimated. In all
cases the error was always below 10%. We also tested the va-
lidity of the sky as cold load by comparing the receiver temper-
ature determined using this same chopper wheel method with a
hot and cold load method using liquid nitrogen. The diﬀerence

is also 10% at most. All together, we estimate that the total cali-
bration uncertainty of our observations is ± 20%.

The conversion between antenna temperature (T ∗

a) and ﬂux
scales, 0.16 K/Jy, was obtained using observations toward
sources with well-known ﬂux and size, such as the planets
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, which were scheduled in all
observing runs. The conversion depends mainly on the aperture
eﬃciency of the telescope, which we have estimated to be 30%
± 10% in an elevation range between 20 and 80 degrees. Sys-
tematic variations of the eﬃciency with elevation were param-
eterized and taken into account. Small variations (10%) in the
eﬃciency can be seen between epochs with very diﬀerent ambi-
ent temperatures, but this variability is included in the calibration
error budget explained earlier.

The 45 GHz receiver has an instantaneous 8 GHz bandwidth.
The signal is downconverted and the Intermediate Frequency
(IF) split into 2 GHz bands, and later the IF split into 0.5 GHz
wide bands. The bands are fed into a fast Fourier transform spec-
trometer with several modules, which can be conﬁgured to pro-
vide diﬀerent band widths and spectral resolutions. The observa-
tions described in this article used two 500 MHz modules, one
per circular polarization, with 16384 channels per module and a
spectral resolution of 30 kHz (approximately 0.21 km/s at this
frequency).

In order to keep a good pointing and focus, pseudo-
continuum observations were performed every one or two hours
toward sources with SiO v=1 J=1−0 maser emission. Pseudo-

continuum observations consist in subtracting the summed spec-
tral emission from the SiO maser from the rest of the spectrum
while performing a pointing drift, or a focus scan. This is a use-
ful technique since local atmospheric conditions have a small
inﬂuence on the results and the baselines obtained are rather ﬂat.
Pointing errors were always kept within 5′′ in both axes.

Observations consisted of spatial on-oﬀ scans with an inte-
gration time of 60 seconds, using a spatial reference 400′′ away
in azimuth to subtract the atmospheric emission correctly. Cal-
ibration scans were performed every 20 minutes. The resulting
baselines are good, and only simple ﬁrst order baselines were
removed from the observed proﬁles.

The calibration of observations previous to April 2014 was
only approximate at ﬁrst because before that date, the antenna
eﬃciency and ﬂux-to-temperature conversion were not system-
atically measured (using planets and other well-known sources).
The absolute calibration of those observations was checked by

comparing the intensities of the wide spectral components and,
in particular, of the plateau (see Sect. 3.1) with observations of
the same sources performed later, since these wide features are
assumed to be constant. As discussed in Sect. 3.2, those sources
in which the plateau is identiﬁed well (IK Tau, GX Mon, χ Cyg,
etc) show signiﬁcantly constant plateau emission, at least within
the calibration uncertainties. The corrections applied to those
preliminary data were always moderate, within the general cali-
bration uncertainty mentioned above. The narrow intense spikes,
very clearly detected in many sources (Sect. 3.1), show strong
variations (as described in Sect. 3.2).

P. de Vicente et al.: 28SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission from evolved stars

acterized by their intense OH maser emission, show proﬁles that
are very similar to those of standard (optically brighter) O-rich
Miras. That proﬁle structure is particularly clear in IRC +10011
(Fig. 4) and OH 44.8-2.3 (Fig. A.10). OH 26.5+0.6 (Fig. A.9)
seems to show similar proﬁles, but with a low S/N ratio that ham-
pers our interpretation.

The observed SiO v=0 J=1−0 proﬁles of the O-rich red su-
pergiants NML Cyg and VX Sgr (Figs. 7 and A.20 respectively)
show properties that are very similar to those of most O-rich
Mira-type variables, except for the width of the proﬁles, which
is wider than ∼ 50 km s−1. In the O-rich red supergiant VY CMa
(Fig. A.18), we ﬁnd a very intense and complex line proﬁle, with
many spikes occupying a very wide spectral region similar to the
v>0 masers. Finally, the red supergiant S Per (Fig. A.19) shows
a complex and spiky proﬁle, which is similar to that of VY CMa,
but the line is less intense and narrower. In all monitored super-
giant stars, the proﬁles are relatively constant with time (Sect.
3.2), even those with narrow spikes. The proﬁles observed in
the yellow hypergiant IRC +10420 (Fig. 8) are wide and fea-
tureless, and very similar to those observed in other molecules
(Quintana-Lacaci et al. 2007).

The C-rich Mira-type variables IRC +10216 (CW Leo, Fig.
5), LP And (Fig. A.11) and CIT 6 (RW LMi, Fig. A.12) show
wide proﬁles with the standard shapes that are often found in
AGB CSEs (and, in particular, in C-rich stars). However, the SiO
v=0 J=1−0 line is weak in these Mira-type variables compared
with emission from other sources and with lines of C-bearing
molecules observed in these sources.

We observed six O-rich semiregular variables,

three of
which, RX Boo, RS Cnc, and X Her, are known to present ax-
isymmetric circumstellar shells; see Sect. 1. In all six cases, the
SiO v=0 J=1−0 proﬁles are comparable to those observed in
CO. In X Her (Fig. 6), the SiO v=0 J=1−0 proﬁle is compos-
ite, which is similar to those we obtained in O-rich Miras, but
with no sign of the spiky structure in the central spectral fea-
ture found in Miras. In this source, the composite CO proﬁle is
known to be due to the axial symmetry observed in interfero-
metric maps (Castro-Carrizo et al. 2010), and the spectral cen-
tral component comes from a very slow expanding disk or torus.
RX Boo (Fig. A.13) shows axial symmetry in CO maps, but the
single-dish CO proﬁles are simple and very similar to our fea-
tureless SiO v=0 J=1−0 line. RS Cnc (Fig. A.14) shows CO
spectra and shell structure similar to those of X Her; our data
also show composite proﬁles similar to those of CO and to those
found in X Her. In two other semiregular variables, R Crt and RT
Vir (Figs. A.15 and A.17), the SiO v=0 J=1−0 and CO proﬁles
are also wide and mostly featureless; no evidence of axial sym-
metry has been found so far in these sources. Finally, W Hya
is often catalogued as a semiregular variable, but its intensity
curves are relatively regular both in the optical and SiO maser
emission (Pardo et al. 2004). The SiO v=0 J=1−0 proﬁles in W
Hya (Fig. A.16) vaguely show a composite structure that is sim-
ilar to that of O rich Miras which could be related to the fact that
W Hya is considered almost a regular variable in some aspects.

3.2. Timevariabilityofthe v=0 J=1−0SiOproﬁles

In order to check the time variability of the SiO v=0 J=1−0
emission, line proﬁles were obtained several times in a num-
ber of stars, during a time period of longer than one year be-
tween about November 2013 and April 2015. We systematically
monitored the stars TX Cam, R Cas, o Cet, IK Tau, χ Cyg,
IRC +10216, VY CMa, NML Cyg, and X Her. As many as six

3. Results

We have observed a total of 28 stars in 28SiO v=0 J=1−0 emis-
sion (with rest frequency 43.423853 GHz), see data in Figs.
1 to 8 and A.1 to A.20. Our sample includes O-rich, S-type,
and C-rich Mira-type variables, OH/IR stars, which are highly-
obscured O-rich Miras with strong OH maser emission, O-rich
super, and hypergiants and semiregular variables. Source prop-
erties are summarized in Table 1 and the diﬀerent kinds of ob-
served spectra are discussed in Sect. 3.1. A summary of the ob-
servational parameters is shown in Table A.1. Most objects were
observed several times, and some of them were more systemat-
ically monitored; see detailed discussion on the observed vari-
ability in Sect. 3.2.

3.1. GeneralpropertiesofSiO v=0 J=1−0emissionfrom

evolvedstars

The O-rich and S-type Mira-type stars systematically show com-
posite spectra, with a wide plateau plus more intense narrow
spikes. This is conspicuously the case of, for instance, TX Cam
(Fig. A.2), GX Mon (Fig. A.7), IK Tau (Fig. 2), R Leo (Fig.
A.5), and the S-type star χ Cyg (Fig. 3). The plateau occupies
a spectral range similar to that of the lines of CO, HCN, SiO
v=0 J=2−1, etc., and shares the same centroid. The total proﬁle
width is expected to give the ﬁnal expansion velocity, while the
centroid would indicate the stellar systemic velocity, see discus-
sion in Sect. 1. The spikes are very narrow and in most cases
occupy a relatively small total range also centered on the sys-
temic velocity. In some stars, notably in TX Cam (Fig. A.2), R
Cas (Fig. A.3), and probably in χ Cyg (Fig. 3), spikes also ap-
pear at more extreme velocities. The narrow spikes tend to show
signiﬁcant variability, contrary to the case of the plateau, which
is remarkably constant; see discussion in Sect. 3.2.

o Cet (Mira) is a peculiar case (Fig. 1). It shows a narrow SiO
v=0 J=1−0 proﬁle, 2–3 km s−1 wide (and some variability in the
whole spectrum). The proﬁles observed in CO from this source
are about twice as wide (Planesas et al. 1990; Ramstedt et al.
2014) and show the same centroid. The CO proﬁles are known
to come from a complex shell, which is probably aﬀected by the
presence of a stellar companion.

We have observed three OH/IR stars. These objects, which
are thought to be very obscured O-rich Mira-type variables char-

A&Aproofs:manuscript no. devicente_aa_2015_27174

independent observations were obtained in the best cases; other
sources were observed two or three times.

As mentioned, the proﬁles in most O-rich and S-type Mira
variables are composite with a wide plateau plus narrow spikes
that often occupy the central parts of the proﬁles. The wide
plateau is remarkably constant, within the uncertainties (Sect.
2). We can see this clearly in the cases of IK Tau, TX Cam,
and the S-type star χ Cyg. The spikes, however, signiﬁcantly
vary, showing clear changes in their relative intensities. In any
case, the overall variations of the SiO v=0 J=1−0 is much more
moderate than in the very strong v≥1 masers; see for example,
Pardo et al. (2004). Those strong maser lines can vary by orders
of magnitude in both line peak and area, while these parameters
rarely vary by a factor of two in our v=0 J=1−0 observations
(see, however, the exceptional cases of χ Cyg and R Cas in Figs.
3 and A.3, respectively).

In two cases, namely TX Cam (Fig. A.2) and R Cas (Fig.
A.3), some spikes appear at more extreme velocities but not in
all epochs. The variability of these satellite peaks is, in the few
observed cases, signiﬁcantly higher than for the rest of the ob-
served features. In the case of χ Cyg (Fig. 3), there is a relative
maximum at about 15 km s−1 LS R, which could be one of these
moderate velocity spikes. However its low intensity and lack of
signiﬁcant variability (at our detection levels) prevent any con-
clusion in this respect. The variability of the particularly narrow
proﬁle found in o Cet (Fig. 1) is noticeable but moderate, and we
can see changes in the proﬁle shape.

In general, the variability of the spikes seems to be chaotic,
without any obvious dependence on the optical or IR phase. Only
the moderate velocity spike in R Cas could be associated with
the phase, appearing more or less at the same time as the optical
maximum of 2014. However, the moderate velocity peaks seen
in TX Cam, between 20 and 25 km s−1, are not correlated with
the optical phase. We conclude that there is no clear association
between the optical or IR cycle and the variations found in the
v=0 J=1−0 spikes.

Some time variability is observed in the red supergiants, but
this vairability is weaker than in the previously mentioned ob-
jects and much weaker than the very large variations found in
their strong v>0 maser emission (Pardo et al. 2004). In these ob-
jects the structure of the proﬁles is kept signiﬁcantly constant
with time. The SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission from other sources
observed several times (semiregular variables and C-rich Mi-
ras) do not show any clear variability. The proﬁles of the O-rich
semiregular variable X Her, which are composite and similar to
those of O-rich Miras (except for the spiky structure of the Mi-
ras), are remarkably constant within the uncertainties, see Fig.
6.

4. The origin of the two-component proﬁles of the

28SiO v=0 J=1−0 line

The relatively intense spikes that form the central spectral fea-
ture systematically observed in SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission from
O-rich and Miras and the S-type Mira χ Cyg are very narrow and
time variable, suggesting that they are the result of maser emis-
sion (Boboltz & Claussen 2004). Their intensity is higher than
that of the surrounding plateau; but it is much weaker, typically
a hundred times weaker in ﬂux units, than the intensity of the
SiO v≥1 masers observed in these sources. We recall that the
vibrationally excited levels are expected to be strongly under-
populated. The energy of the v=1 levels is about 1800 K higher
in energy than the ground v=0 levels (and the v=2 levels are at

Article number, page 6 of 12

about 3600 K from the ground). Moreover, the vibrational exci-
tation temperature is expected to be of just some hundred Kelvin,
even for high kinetic temperatures, since the very fast sponta-
neous decay of the vibrationally excited levels (faster than 5 s−1)
prevents thermalization (in fact the v>0 levels are mostly popu-
lated by the stellar IR radiation, see for example Bujarrabal et al.
1996) Therefore, the relative population of the vibrationally ex-
cited rotational levels must be smaller than 10%.

From their VLA maps, Boboltz & Claussen (2004) conclude
that these spikes come from relatively wide spots, the strongest
spike of each source is about 0.′′2-0.′′4 wide, in which the bright-
ness is moderately high, 104-105 K. Meanwhile, the v>0 maser
spots are really tiny, at a few mas wide, and show a very high
∼ 109 K (Diamond et al. 1994; Desmurs et al. 2014).
brightness >
In both cases, the maser spots are placed at a few stellar radii
from the star, and the v=0 J=1−0 emission is somewhat more
extended; in angular units, the total extent is typically found to
be ∼ 0.′′2 for v=0 J=1−0 emission and <

∼ 0.′′1 for v>0 masers.

The only way to explain the low brightness of the v=0 J=1−0
spikes relative to the v>0 masers, is to assume that the ampliﬁ-
cation of the maser eﬀect responsible for the v=0 J=1−0 (weak)
masers is much lower than that of the strong masers. From the
above mentioned brightness levels, we expect |τ(v=0 J=1−0)| ∼
|τ(v=1 J=1−0)| – 10; in a rough estimate, |τ(v=0 J=1−0)| must
be of just a few units.

xu

∼

xl−xu

It is surprising that, in spite of the much higher popula-
tion of the v=0 rotational levels, the opacity modulus is so low,
particularly compared with those of the v>0 masers. We re-
call that τ ∝
∼ x/Tex, where x is the relative population per mag-
netic sublevel (i.e., the average of the upper and lower levels,
x=(nu/gu + nl/gl)/2) and Tex is the excitation temperature of the
maser transition. Therefore, Tex (∝
) must be very high in ab-
solute value, i.e. the population inversion must be extremely low
with xu practically identical to xl and xu − xl ≪ x. The inversion
of the v>0 masers is already not very high in the intense spots,
with Tex ∼ −100 K (since the maser is probably saturated). In
the v=1 J=1−0 maser, for instance, the inversion is just of about
2%, x(J=1) ∼ x(J=0)×1.02. Hence we ﬁnd a conservative up-
per limit of 0.1% on the v=0 J=1−0 population inversion in the
maser clumps that would be responsible for the observed narrow
spikes in our proﬁles. Such a ﬁne tuning of the level population
leading to a very slight population inversion seems improbable
and able to operate only in very peculiar conditions, but the v=0
J=1−0 spikes are ubiquitous in O-rich Mira-type stars. The in-
version of this transition would be due to an ineﬃcient pump-
ing mechanism, leading to very easily saturated maser emission
with relatively low brightness levels. This is a situation that, to
our knowledge, has only been found in this case. We think that
the actual origin of the v=0 J=1−0 spikes is not well understood
yet.

4.1. SpectralfeaturesinO-richMira-typeandsemiregular

variables

The proﬁle structures found in O-rich Mira-type variables (in-
cluding the S-type star χ Cyg) and in the semiregular variables X
Her and RS Cnc are remarkable. In all cases, the line is compos-
ite, with a central stronger feature plus a wider plateau. The cen-
tral feature is, however, diﬀerent. While in Miras variables that
component is composed of a number of narrow time-variable
spikes, in the semiregulars it is smooth and does not show sig-
niﬁcant variability in our observations; this is probably because
of thermal emission instead of population inversion. The plateau

P. de Vicente et al.: 28SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission from evolved stars

is in all cases constant with time and seems to be due to thermal
emission.

The origin of the composite structure of the line proﬁles in X
Her and RS Cnc (found not only in v=0 J=1−0, but also in the
other molecular lines, Sect. 1) is known to be due to the over-
all CSE structure, which is also complex. In contrast to what
happens in most Miras, whose shells show a signiﬁcant spheri-
cal symmetry at scales larger than 1′′, (Sect. 1) the CSEs around
these semiregular variables show an equatorial slowly expanding
disk and a bipolar low-collimation outﬂow, which are responsi-
ble for the central component and the plateau of the lines of SiO
(and other molecules), respectively. This shell structure is sim-
ilar, although with lower velocities, to that commonly observed
in protoplanetary nebulae, which is the obvious precedent of the
strong axial symmetry found in planetary nebulae (often show-
ing torus-like or double-bubble structures).

As we have seen, we also ﬁnd in Mira-type O-rich stars two-
component proﬁles, in which the central spikes seem to show
weak maser eﬀects. The simplest explanation of these compos-
ite proﬁles is to assume that they come from the superposition of
a standard wide proﬁle, due to thermal emission from expanding
shells, and a group of weak maser spikes, whose low projected
velocity would be due to a predominantly tangential ampliﬁca-
tion (as found in the very intense v>0 masers, Sect. 1). As an al-
ternative, we speculate that the similar v=0 J=1−0 proﬁle shapes
shown by these objects and by the above mentioned semiregular
variables could indicate that, independent of the maser or ther-
mal nature of the emission, the line shapes in both kinds of ob-
jects have a common origin: the presence of axial symmetry in
the emitting region. In O-rich Miras, such an asymmetry would
only appear in the very compact SiO emitting region, and at large
scale would in some way disappear or be more diﬃcult to detect,
but would become dominant in later evolutionary phases. We ﬁ-
nally note that clear composite structures are not usually found
in higher-J v=0 SiO proﬁles (Sect. 1). The reason for this could
be that the maser eﬀect found in v=0 J=1−0, which is certainly
very peculiar, does not appear in other v=0 transitions and/or
that absorption by outer regions is very high in those lines; the
opacity of high-J lines is expected to be high, since it increases
roughly proportionally to J2 under these conditions of high ex-
citation. The lack of maps with high sensitivity (allowing good
images of the whole proﬁles) and angular resolution (allowing
images at 0.′′1 scales) prevents any ﬁrm conclusion at the mo-
ment. We hope that future high-quality observations will throw
light on this topic.

The two-component proﬁles also found in (at least some) red
supergiants could also indicate that phenomena similar to those
described above are present in their inner shells. The SiO v=0
proﬁles of C-rich AGB stars (and some S-type objects) are, how-
ever, smooth and wide, which is very similar to those observed
in the emission of other molecules. Maps of v=0 J=2−1 emis-
sion (Sect. 1) show that its extent is signiﬁcantly larger than for
O-rich Miras, which is attributed to the diﬀerent grain formation
processes, but with a relatively low SiO abundance. The diﬀer-
ence in the v=0 proﬁles of C-rich and O-rich Mira-type stars
would be due to these properties.

5. Summary and conclusions

We present observations of SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission from 28
evolved stars, including O-rich, S-type and C-rich Mira-type
variables, OH/IR (O-rich) stars, O-rich semiregular long-period
variables, red supergiant stars, and one yellow hypergiant star.
All these stars are more or less regular pulsators with long

periods of about one year or more and are known to be sur-
rounded by thick circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) emitting in
maser and thermal (not masing) molecular lines; see Sect. 1. We
performed studies of the emission variability in about one half
of the sources, spanning over more than one year.

In most O-rich and S-type Mira-type stars (including the
OH/IR objects), the observed proﬁles are composite, with a wide
spectral feature or plateau and a set of narrow, relatively intense
spikes in the line center (Sect. 3.1). The plateau occupies roughly
the same velocity range as the smooth proﬁles characteristic of
thermal molecular lines (CO, HCN, SiO v=0 J=2−1, etc). The
spikes occupy a central narrower spectral region and are prob-
ably the result of weak maser eﬀects (see below). A peculiar
case is o Cet, (Mira, a binary O-rich star showing an asymmetric
shell), which shows narrow spiky proﬁles of SiO v=0 J=1−0.

The SiO v=0 J=1−0 line in C-rich stars shows smooth fea-
tureless proﬁles, very similar to those of the other molecules and
probably due to thermal emission.

The observed supergiants also show complex proﬁles with
many spikes. NML Cyg, S Per, and VX Sgr show two-
component proﬁles similar to those observed in O-rich Mi-
ras (except for the larger total width). The yellow hypergiant
IRC +10420 shows a smooth proﬁle, which is very similar to
those of standard lines.

The SiO v=0 J=1−0 proﬁles of the selected semiregular gi-
ants are smooth, except for the spiky proﬁles found in W Hya
(a source that shows a very regular variability and is sometimes
catalogued as Mira-type variable). Two semiregulars, X Her and
RS Cnc, show composite proﬁles including a wide plateau plus
a central stronger feature, but this proﬁle is not composed of nar-
row spikes. Remarkably, the proﬁles of standard lines observed
in X Her and RS Cnc, e.g., CO J=1−0 and J=2−1 (see Sects.
1, 3.1), are practically identical to those we ﬁnd and are known
to be associated with a signiﬁcant axial symmetry of the circum-
stellar envelope.

Signiﬁcant variability was found in the narrow spikes we de-
tect in SiO v=0 J=1−0 emission, mostly in the O-rich regular
pulsators and the S-type Mira-type star χ Cyg (Sect. 3.2). How-
ever, the wide features, including the plateaus clearly identiﬁed
in many sources, the two spectral components observed in X Her
and RS Cnc, and the whole proﬁles of C-rich objects, are signif-
icantly constant within the calibration uncertainties. The vari-
ations of the narrow spikes are not clearly correlated with the
stellar pulsation cycle.

The relatively intense spikes that form the central spectral
feature systematically observed in O-rich and Miras and the S-
type Mira χ Cyg are very narrow and time variable, suggesting
that they are the result of maser emission (Sect. 3). Their in-
tensity is higher than that of the surrounding plateau, but it is
much lower, typically by a hundred times, than the intensity of
the SiO v>0 masers observed in these sources. The low ﬂux and
brightness characteristic of these spikes, despite the high relative
population of the v=0 rotational levels (Sect. 4), indicates that
probably the maser pumping of the v=0 J=1−0 spikes is very
peculiar and much less eﬃcient than that of the v>0 masers.

The simplest explanation of the two-component v=0 J=1−0
proﬁles observed in O-rich and S-type regular pulsators is that
they are due to the superposition of standard wide proﬁles and a
group of weak maser spikes coming from very inner layers, for
which, as happens for the v>0 strong masers, tangential ampli-
ﬁcation leads to a relatively narrow total dispersion in velocity;
see Sect 4.1. We speculate that it would be useful, if conﬁrmed,
to study the onset of axial structures in the post-AGB evolution,
and that the similar proﬁles found in O-rich and S-type regular

pulsators and in semiregular variables may have a similar origin
(regardless of possible maser eﬀects in the narrow spikes), indi-
cating the systematic presence of axial symmetry in the inner-
most layers of most AGB CSEs. The CSEs of O-rich and S-type
Miras are known to be spherical and isotropical at scales >
∼ 1′′;
their SiO thermal emission comes precisely from regions ∼ 1′′
wide. Future high-quality maps at this frequency are expected to
solve this question.
