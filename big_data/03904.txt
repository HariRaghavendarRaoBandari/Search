ABSTRACT
We detect the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (kSZ) effect with a statistical signiﬁcance of
4.2σ by combining a cluster catalogue derived from the ﬁrst year data of the Dark Energy Sur-
vey (DES) with CMB temperature maps from the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel’dovich
(SPT-SZ) Survey. This measurement is performed with a differential statistic that isolates
the pairwise kSZ signal, providing the ﬁrst detection of the large-scale, pairwise motion of
clusters using redshifts derived from photometric data. By ﬁtting the pairwise kSZ signal to
a theoretical template we measure the average central optical depth of the cluster sample,
¯τe = (3.75 ± 0.89) · 10−3. We compare the extracted signal to realistic simulations and ﬁnd
good agreement with respect to the signal-to-noise, the constraint on ¯τe, and the correspond-
ing gas fraction. High-precision measurements of the pairwise kSZ signal with future data
will be able to place constraints on the baryonic physics of galaxy clusters, and could be used
to probe gravity on scales (cid:38) 100 Mpc.

INTRODUCTION

Galaxy clusters, as the largest gravitationally-bound structures in
the Universe, are important probes of cosmology and astrophysics.
These massive systems imprint their signature on the cosmic mi-
crowave background (CMB) through both the thermal Sunyaev-
Zel’dovich (tSZ) effect — in which (cid:46) 1% of CMB photons pass-
ing through the centre of a massive cluster inverse-Compton scatter

well as the kinematic SZ effect (kSZ) in which the bulk motion of
clusters imparts a Doppler shift to the CMB signal (Sunyaev & Zel-
dovich 1972, 1980). The kinematic and thermal SZ effects can also
be thought of as ﬁrst- and second-order terms of the same phys-
ical process: the scattering of photons with a Planck distribution
on moving electrons. The ﬁrst-order kSZ effect leaves the CMB
spectrum unaffected, whereas the second-order tSZ imparts spec-
tral distortions. Because the thermal electron velocities within the
cluster are much larger than its bulk velocity, the second-order ef-
fect dominates here: for typical cluster masses and velocities, the

amplitude of the kSZ effect is an order of magnitude smaller than
its thermal counterpart (e.g. Birkinshaw 1999).

The tSZ effect has been well characterized, both through its
contribution to the CMB temperature power spectrum (see e.g. Das
et al. 2014; George et al. 2015), and via measurements on individ-
ual clusters (e.g. Plagge et al. 2010; Planck Collaboration 2013;
Bonamente et al. 2012; Sayers et al. 2013a). The kSZ signal, how-
ever, has proved to be more elusive, both because of its smaller am-
plitude and its spectrum identical to that of primary CMB tempera-
ture ﬂuctuations. While challenging to measure, the kSZ effect has
great potential for constraining both astrophysical and cosmologi-
cal models (see e.g. Rephaeli & Lahav 1991; Haehnelt & Tegmark
1996; Diaferio et al. 2005; Bhattacharya & Kosowsky 2007, 2008).
From an astrophysical point of view, the kSZ signal can be used
to probe so-called ‘missing baryons’ (e.g. Hernández-Monteagudo
et al. 2015; Schaan et al. 2015) — i.e. those baryons that reside
in diffuse, highly ionized intergalactic media (see e.g. McGaugh
2008). Conversely, peculiar velocities estimated from the kSZ ef-
fect, together with external constraints on cluster astrophysics, pro-
vide independent measurements of the amplitude and growth rate
of density perturbations. The latter in turn can be used to test mod-
els of dark energy, modiﬁed gravity (Keisler & Schmidt 2013; Ma
& Zhao 2014; Mueller et al. 2015b; Bianchini & Silvestri 2015)
and massive neutrinos (Mueller et al. 2015a).

The ﬁrst detection of the kSZ signal was reported in Hand
et al. (2012) (H12 henceforth), using high-resolution CMB data
from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT, Swetz et al. 2011)
in conjunction with the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey
(BOSS) spectroscopic catalogue (Ahn et al. 2012). To isolate the
kSZ signal, H12 applied a differential (or pairwise) statistical ap-
proach, which we also adopt in this paper. H12 rejected the null hy-
pothesis of zero kSZ signal with a p-value of 0.002. Subsequently,
the Planck collaboration (Planck Collaboration 2015a) used the
Central Galaxy Catalog derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(Abazajian et al. 2009) to report 1.8 − 2.5σ evidence for the pair-
wise kSZ signal with a template ﬁt. Other recent detections (∼3σ)
of the kSZ signal have been obtained via cross-correlation of CMB
maps with velocity ﬁelds reconstructed from galaxy density ﬁelds
(Planck Collaboration 2015a; Schaan et al. 2015); see also Li et al.
(2014) for a demonstration of this method using simulations. Indi-
rect evidence for a kSZ component in the CMB power spectrum
was also seen in power spectrum measurements from the South
Pole Telescope (SPT, George et al. 2015). Finally, the kSZ signal
has been measured locally for one individual cluster by Sayers et al.
(2013b).

In this work, we measure the pairwise kSZ signal by com-
bining a catalogue of galaxy clusters derived from the Dark En-
ergy Survey (DES; The Dark Energy Survey Collaboration 2005,
Dark Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2016) Year 1 data with a
CMB temperature map from the 2,500 square degree South Pole
Telescope Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SPT-SZ) Survey. Our paper is or-
ganised as follows: in Section 2 we brieﬂy review the kSZ effect
and the theory of pairwise velocities, and derive an analytic tem-
plate for the pairwise kSZ effect. Section 3 introduces the two in-
put data sets from DES and SPT and in Section 4 we detail the
analysis methods. In Section 5 we brieﬂy describe the new suite of
realistic high-resolution kSZ simulations by Flender et al. (2015)
and validate the pairwise kSZ template and the analysis methods
on these simulations. We proceed by showing our main results and
comparing them both to analytic theory and the expectation from
simulations in Section 6. The various checks and different null tests
that we perform to demonstrate the robustness of our results against

systematic uncertainties are described in Section 7. Finally, we dis-
cuss the implications of our detection for cluster astrophysics in
Section 8.

Unless otherwise speciﬁed, we use the Planck 2015
TT+TE+EE+lowP cosmological parameters, i.e. the Hubble pa-
rameter H0 = 67.3 km s−1 Mpc−1, cold dark matter density
Ωch2 = 0.1198, baryon density Ωbh2 = 0.02225, current root
mean square (rms) of the linear matter ﬂuctuations on scales of
8 h−1Mpc, σ8 = 0.831, and spectral index of the primordial scalar
ﬂuctuations ns = 0.9645 (Planck Collaboration 2015b), to com-
pute theoretical predictions and to translate redshifts into distances.

2 THEORY
2.1 The pairwise kSZ effect

In the non-relativistic limit and assuming only single scatterings for
individual photons, the kSZ effect produced by a galaxy cluster i
observed in the angular direction ˆni corresponds to a change in the
CMB temperature TCMB given by

ˆri · vi

,

c

(ˆni) = −τe,i

∆T
(1)
TCMB
(Sunyaev & Zeldovich 1980). Here ˆri · vi is the projection of the
cluster velocity vi along the line of sight ˆri, and c is the speed of
light. The Thomson optical depth τe,i for CMB photons passing
through a cluster i is given by the line-of-sight integral of the free
electron number density ne,i,

(cid:90)

τe,i =

dl ne,i(r)σT ,

(2)

where σT is the Thomson cross section. Therefore the kSZ effect
probes the bulk momentum of the ionized cluster gas projected onto
the line of sight.

Measuring the velocities of individual clusters is currently
only possible in rare exceptions (e.g. in the detection by Sayers
et al. 2013b) since the kSZ signal has the same spectral shape as the
primary CMB, and its amplitude is small compared to the tSZ am-
plitude. This has motivated alternative methods of isolating the kSZ
signal. On scales smaller than the homogeneity scale, clusters will
— on average — fall towards each other under their mutual grav-
itational attraction (e.g. Bhattacharya & Kosowsky 2007, 2008).
Because of the kSZ effect, this pairwise motion creates a partic-
ular pattern in the CMB, consisting of temperature increments and
decrements at the locations of clusters moving towards and away
from the observer, respectively (e.g. Diaferio et al. 2000). The CMB
pattern caused by such motion of cluster pairs is called the pairwise
kSZ signal.

Whereas the kSZ signal from one individual cluster is sensi-
tive to the line-of-sight velocity of that cluster, the amplitude of the
pairwise kSZ signal from a sample of clusters at comoving pair sep-
aration r can be related to the mean relative velocity v12(r) of the
clusters (independent of the line-of-sight). We write the pairwise
kSZ amplitude as
TpkSZ(r) ≡ ¯τe

v12(r)

where ¯τe is the average optical depth of the cluster sample.1 In our
sign convention TpkSZ < 0 indicates that clusters are on average

1 Note that with equation 3 we implicitly make the ansatz (cid:104)τev(cid:105) (cid:39)
(cid:104)τe(cid:105)(cid:104)v(cid:105). We further discuss this assumption in Section 7.5.

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2016)

approaching each other (v12 < 0). We ﬁrst build a model for v12(r)
in Section 2.2, then relate the line-of-sight velocities inferred from
the data to the total signal TpkSZ(r) in Section 4.2.

2.2 Modelling the pairwise velocity of clusters

Clusters of galaxies — or, more generally, the dark matter haloes
that host them — are located at the peaks of the cosmic density
ﬁeld. The latter is described by the overdensity δ(x) ≡ ρ(x)/¯ρ− 1
with the matter density ρ(x) and its mean ¯ρ. Similarly, the overden-
sity of haloes is δh(x) ≡ n(x)/¯n − 1, where n(x) is the number
density of haloes and ¯n their mean density. At linear level, and un-
der the assumption of deterministic, local bias (Fry & Gaztanaga
1993), δh(x) can be related to δ(x) as δh(x) = bh δ(x), where bh
is the linear halo bias.

The total apparent velocity v(x) of a dark matter particle can
be decomposed into the Hubble ﬂow and a peculiar velocity u(x)
as v(x) = aHx + u(x), where H is the Hubble constant. In linear
perturbation theory, the velocity ﬁeld is completely described by
its divergence ϑ(x) ≡ ∇· u(x). The linearised continuity equation
relates the density and velocity ﬁelds (Bernardeau et al. 2002):
ϑ(x) = − ˙δ(x) = −aHf δ(x) ,
where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to conformal time
and a is the scale factor in the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-
Walker metric. Furthermore, f is the growth rate of density pertur-
bations deﬁned as f ≡ d ln D/d ln a, where D is the linear growth
factor.

(4)

If the density and velocity ﬁelds are assumed to be Gaus-
sian, their statistical properties are speciﬁed completely by their
two-point statistics. The two-point correlation function of the mat-
ter density perturbations at comoving separation r is given by
ξ(r) ≡ (cid:104)δ(x) δ(x + r)(cid:105), while the power spectrum P (k) in Fourier
space is deﬁned as (cid:104)δ(k) δ(k(cid:48))(cid:105) = (2π)3δD(k + k(cid:48))P (k), where
δD is the Dirac delta distribution. Using equation 4 and the relation
between the power spectrum and the two-point correlation func-
tion, the density-velocity correlation function can be written as

ξδv(r, a) ≡ (cid:104)δ(x) ˆr·v(x+r)(cid:105) = − aHf

where jn are the spherical Bessel functions.

The mean pairwise velocity of haloes, v12(r), is a measure of
the relative velocities of density peaks (e.g. Davis & Peebles 1977;
Peebles 1980). Following Schmidt (2010), we now write v12(r) as

v12(r) =

(cid:104)n(x1) n(x2) ˆr · (v2 − v1)(cid:105)

(cid:104)n(x1) n(x2)(cid:105)

.

(6)

Assuming that the velocities of haloes are unbiased2, equation 6
becomes

(cid:104)[1 + bhδ(x1)] [1 + bhδ(x2)] ˆr · (v2 − v1)(cid:105)

,

(7)

v12(r) =

1 + ξh(r)

where ξh(r) is the two-point correlation function of haloes. For
comparison with observations and simulations, we are interested in
the mean pairwise velocity of a cluster sample within a given mass

2 This assumption will eventually become inaccurate for small pair sep-
arations (r (cid:46) 50 Mpc), where haloes are found to have biased velocities
(Baldauf et al. 2015). However, these scales do not contribute signiﬁcantly
to our analysis as a result of the photometric redshift uncertainties.

which on the scales of interest here is a good approximation for the
halo bias moments of Bhattacharya & Kosowsky (2008); Mueller
et al. (2015b). To evaluate equation 8, for n(M ) we use the halo
mass function of Tinker et al. (2008) computed with the HMF code
(Murray et al. 2013), and for bh(M ) the halo bias model by Tinker
et al. (2010).

As a consistency check, we note that this expression is equiv-
alent to previous derivations of the mean pairwise velocity from
the pair conservation equation (e.g. Peebles 1980): Here the mean
pairwise streaming velocity can be written as (Sheth et al. 2001;
see also Bhattacharya & Kosowsky 2008; Mueller et al. 2015b)

,

where ¯ξ(r, a) is the correlation function averaged within a sphere of
comoving radius r and b is again an averaged bias. In linear theory,
ξδv(r, a) = −arHf ¯ξ(r, a)/3, demonstrating the equivalence of
equations 9 and 10.

We now use equation 9 to predict the mean pairwise velocity
in our theoretical template. For the computation of ξ and ξδv we
evaluate P (k) using the PYCAMB3 interface to the CAMB4 code
(Lewis et al. 2000). As we are interested only in the large-scale
behaviour of the pairwise velocities, we remove small-scale ﬂuctu-
ations by smoothing the power spectrum with a spherical top-hat
ﬁlter of radius R = 3 h−1Mpc. This procedure ensures that there
are no unphysical oscillations in the theory prediction for v12(r),
which would otherwise be caused by a sharp cut-off of the highest-
k modes. We have checked that our results are insensitive to the
exact choice of the smoothing scale. We demonstrate with the use
of mocks in Section 5.2 below that the model of equations 3, 9 de-
scribes the simulations well on scales r (cid:38) 40 Mpc in the absence
of redshift uncertainties.

2.3 Modelling the photo-z uncertainties

tance to a cluster at redshift z is given by dc(z) =(cid:82) z

To account for the uncertainty in the photometric cluster redshift
(photo-z), we modify the pairwise kSZ template (equations 3, 9) to
model the dilution of the signal on small scales. The comoving dis-
0 dz(cid:48) c/H(z(cid:48)),
so uncertainties in cluster redshifts are converted to errors in their
distances by ∆dc (cid:39) c∆z/H(z). Using the redshift errors from
the cluster catalogue described in Section 3.1 below and assum-
ing they follow a roughly Gaussian distribution (see Rykoff et al.
2016), we compute an rms uncertainty in the comoving distance,
σdc. For the sample used in this work we ﬁnd σdc (cid:39) 50 Mpc. The
corresponding uncertainty in the separation of the cluster pairs af-
fects the recovered pairwise kSZ signal: redshift errors completely

dilute the signal at r (cid:28) σdc, the signal is signiﬁcantly reduced
on scales r ∼ σdc, and only the signal from cluster pairs with
r (cid:29) σdc remains unaffected. Given that the pairwise kSZ signal is
strongest at small separations (r (cid:46) 50 Mpc), this poses one of the
main challenges for our analysis.

We account for this effect heuristically by multiplying the tem-
plate with a smoothing factor which models the dilution of the pair-
wise kSZ signal on small scales. The ﬁnal template is thus:

TpkSZ(r, a) = ¯τe

(11)

The pair separation smoothing scale σr — i.e. the rms uncer-
tainty in cluster pair separation — can be inferred from the red-
√
shift errors of the cluster sample; here we approximate it by setting
2σdc.5 We demonstrate in Section 5.2 below that the full
σr =
model of equation 11 provides a good ﬁt to realistic simulations
that include photometric redshift errors.

2.4 Dependence on astrophysics and cosmology

Equation 11 shows that the pairwise kSZ signal constrains a combi-
nation of cluster astrophysics (b¯τe) and cosmology (ξδv, ξ). While
the signal shape is mostly speciﬁed by the cosmology, the ampli-
tude is scaled by b and ¯τe; by ﬁxing the cosmological parameters
and the bias prescription, a pairwise kSZ measurement can con-
strain the mean optical depth of the cluster sample. This argument
can also be turned around: given measurements of b (e.g. from the
cluster auto-correlation) and ¯τe (e.g. from X-ray or tSZ observa-
tions), constraints on cosmology can be derived. To illustrate the
parameter dependence, we consider large scales (r (cid:38) 60 Mpc, see
Section 5.2 below). Here b2ξ(r) (cid:28) 1 so that
TpkSZ(r) ∝ b ¯τe ξδv(r) ∝ b ¯τe f σ2
and hence the shape of the signal is completely speciﬁed by the cos-
mology via ξδv(r). From a cosmological perspective, the depen-
dence on f σ2
8 is particularly interesting. Other dynamical probes
like redshift space distortions constrain primarily the combina-
tion f σ8 (see e.g. Percival & White 2009), so a measurement of
the pairwise kSZ could be used to break the degeneracy between
growth and initial amplitude. The resulting constraints on f could
in turn be used as a probe of dark energy or modiﬁcations of gravity
(Keisler & Schmidt 2013).

3 DATA
3.1 DES redMaPPer cluster catalogue

The Dark Energy Survey is an ongoing 5-band grizY photometric
survey of 5, 000 deg2 of the Southern sky that uses the Dark Energy
Camera (Flaugher et al. 2015) on the 4-metre Blanco Telescope at
Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). At full depth,
DES will allow the extraction of cluster catalogues that are com-
plete for clusters with M500c (cid:38) 1014M(cid:12) — where M500c is the
mass within a spherical region with an average density of 500 times
the critical density — out to redshifts z < 0.9 (Rykoff et al. 2016).

5 This is a reasonable approximation because the pairwise estimator as-
signs the highest weights to cluster pairs with separation along the line of
sight and σz is a relatively slowly growing function of z.

The sky footprint of DES was chosen to have almost com-
plete overlap with the SPT-SZ survey region. This has already en-
abled several studies cross-correlating DES Science Veriﬁcation
data with SPT-SZ (Giannantonio et al. 2016; Saro et al. 2015; Kirk
et al. 2015; Baxter et al. 2016). Here we use data from the full ﬁrst
year of DES observations (Y1) that overlap with ∼1, 400 deg2 of
the SPT-SZ footprint. The area in which clusters can be identiﬁed
is reduced by 10 − 15% because of boundary effects and masking
of bright stars (Rykoff et al. 2016). Thus the effective sky area for
this analysis is ∼1, 200 deg2, which we show in Fig. 1.

This work uses a cluster catalogue constructed from DES data
using the red-sequence Matched-ﬁlter Probabilistic Percolation
(redMaPPer) algorithm ﬁrst described by Rykoff et al. (2014)
and subsequently developed and tested against X-ray and SZ-
based cluster catalogues (Rozo & Rykoff 2014; Rozo et al. 2015).
RedMaPPer is a photometric red-sequence based cluster ﬁnder that
is trained on a sub-sample of clusters with spectroscopic redshifts
to calibrate the red sequence model. The cluster ﬁnder provides 3D
cluster positions, where the angular coordinates are taken to be at
the algorithm’s best estimate for the central galaxy position and the
redshifts are estimated photometrically.

RedMaPPer also provides an optical richness estimate, λ,
which is a low-scatter optical proxy for the cluster mass (Rykoff
et al. 2012; Saro et al. 2015). To account for partially masked
clusters or member galaxies fainter than the limiting magnitude,
redMaPPer applies a correction factor s to the optical richness, such
that λ = s˜λ where ˜λ are the raw galaxy counts. Because a sample
with more uniform noise properties is obtained if cuts are applied in
˜λ (see Rykoff et al. 2014; Rozo & Rykoff 2014; Rozo et al. 2015;
Rykoff et al. 2016, for details), we apply richness cuts using this
quantity.

The full DES Y1 redMaPPer ‘gold’ catalogue spans the photo-
z range 0.1 < z < 0.95. As both completeness and photo-z ac-
curacy degrade at high redshift, for the main result of this work
we use only clusters at z < 0.8. This z < 0.8 sample is still
not entirely pure (due to scatter in the richness estimate), nor is it
complete to the same richness at high redshift due to depth limita-
tions: the effective richness threshold grows with redshift, reaching
λmin (cid:39) 40 at z = 0.8. To test for a potential bias caused by this
evolution, we repeat the analysis with a more conservative redshift
cut of z < 0.65, obtaining consistent results.
We use all clusters in the richness range 20 < ˜λ < 60 —
where λ (cid:39) 20 broadly corresponds to M500c (cid:39) 1014M(cid:12) — for
the main analysis, while also considering a larger catalogue ex-
tended to lower richness 10 < ˜λ < 60 in Section 6.4. The low-˜λ
cutoff is driven by several competing factors. As the mass func-
tion grows exponentially at the low-mass end, so does the number
of clusters (and hence the number of pairs). On the other hand,
low richness clusters are more susceptible to errors in redshift and
centring, which washes out the signal. The high-λ cutoff is set be-
cause the tSZ strongly dominates the signal in high-mass clusters.
Including these rare, heavy objects in the sample could result in an
insufﬁcient cancellation of the tSZ signal and could therefore bias
the pairwise kSZ measurement. We have found with the simula-
tions that the upper cut chosen here maximizes the signal-to-noise,
while not introducing a signiﬁcant bias into the pairwise kSZ am-
plitude. A potential contamination by tSZ is further investigated in
Section 7.2 below.

We ﬁnally remove clusters that fall within masked regions sur-
rounding point sources detected in the SPT-SZ maps (see next sec-
tion). After these cuts, the catalogue contains 6,693 (28,760) clus-
ters in the SPT-SZ footprint for the ˜λ > 20 (˜λ > 10) sample; the

the 150 GHz data6 in the region that overlaps with the DES Y1
cluster catalogue (∼1, 200 deg2, see Fig. 1).

The survey was observed in 19 sub-patches, or ﬁelds. Each
ﬁeld was observed in at least 200 individual observations, and maps
from individual observations are coadded into a single map for each
ﬁeld. The detector time-ordered-data are ﬁltered, then projected
using the telescope pointing model into maps with the Sanson-
Flamsteed projection (Calabretta & Greisen 2002). In an update
from B15, absolute calibration of the maps was derived using the
2015 release of the Planck 143 GHz data (Planck Collaboration
2015c). Emissive point sources are masked as follows: a 4(cid:48) (10(cid:48))
radius mask is applied to all sources detected at ≥ 5σ (≥ 20σ) in
the 150 GHz maps (see, e.g. Mocanu et al. 2013), removing ∼7%
((cid:28) 1%) of the initial 2,500 deg2 survey area. Any clusters within
these masks are removed from the kSZ analysis.

4 ANALYSIS METHODS
4.1 Matched ﬁltering and temperature estimates

(13)

Since we have prior knowledge about the shape of the expected SZ
signal from clusters, we can improve the signal-to-noise by ﬁltering
the CMB maps to suppress noisy modes and enhance modes with
high expected signal. We use a matched ﬁlter technique (see e.g.
Haehnelt & Tegmark 1996; Melin et al. 2006) identical to that used
in B15. The observed temperature in a direction x can be written
as
T (x) = B(x) ∗ [Tclust(x) + nastro(x)] + nnoise(x) .
Here B(x) characterises the effect of the instrumental beam and
data ﬁltering and the asterisk denotes a convolution. The SZ signal
from clusters Tclust(x) is comprised of tSZ and kSZ components
and nastro(x) characterises the noise contribution from astrophys-
ical sources that include the lensed primary CMB, emission from
dusty extragalactic sources, as well as the kinematic and thermal SZ
background; all components are treated as Gaussian noise and mod-
elled from previous SPT power spectrum measurements (Keisler
et al. 2011, Shirokoff et al. 2011). Emission from cluster members
and the effect of lensing of dusty background galaxies by the clus-
ter is removed on average by the pairwise estimator (see Section 4.2
below); radio sources below the SPT detection threshold contribute
negligibly to the maps, and are ignored. Finally, noise from the in-
strument and the atmosphere is given by nnoise(x).

For the purposes of ﬁltering, we model the SZ signal from a
single cluster as an amplitude T0 times an azimuthally symmetric
real-space proﬁle ρ(θ), where θ is the angle from the cluster centre.
For the cluster proﬁle template ρ(θ), we use a projected isothermal
β-model (Cavaliere & Fusco-Femiano 1976) with β = 1 given by

(cid:0)1 + θ2/θ2

c

(cid:1)−1

T (θ) = T0

,

(14)

where T0 is the normalisation, and the core radius θc controls the
size of the expected signal. This choice of proﬁle does not affect
the detection signiﬁcance of the analysis, see Section 6.2. Although
the tSZ and kSZ components are expected to follow slightly differ-
ent proﬁle shapes, here we assume for simplicity this single model

6 In principle, it would be possible to combine the three SPT frequencies
to reduce sensitivity to noise and tSZ signal in the CMB maps; however,
the 90 and 220 GHz data are signiﬁcantly noisier than the 150 GHz band,
so that combining them would introduce additional complexity without a
substantial gain.

purposes) in the overlapping regions of the DES Y1 cluster catalogue and

of the SPT-SZ survey footprint. The effective sky are for this analysis is
∼1, 200 deg2.

corresponding surface density is 5.6 deg−2 (24 deg−2). We have
tested the robustness of the results with respect to the applied cuts.
We show in Fig. 2 the distribution of clusters in redshift and
optical richness, as well as the associated errors, for both the high-
and low-richness samples. The left panel of Fig. 2 shows that the
photo-z errors vary for both cluster samples as a function of red-
shift; there are two redshift ranges where the photo-z quality is
signiﬁcantly degraded: around z (cid:39) 0.4 and z (cid:39) 0.7. This is
due to the typical red-sequence galaxy spectral feature, the 4000
Å-break, transitioning between the DES photometric bands. Over
the whole redshift range, we observe that the photo-z errors of the
high-richness sample are σz/(1+z) ∈ [0.005, 0.015], signiﬁcantly
smaller than in the low-richness case, for which σz/(1 + z) ∈
[0.005, 0.025]; see also the bottom left panel of Fig. 2. As the pair-
wise kSZ signal is smoothed at cluster separations comparable with
the photo-z errors (see Section 2.3), this motivates our choice of the
˜λ > 20 sample for the main analysis.

3.2 SPT-SZ temperature maps

The CMB data consist of temperature maps made from the SPT-SZ
observations. This analysis uses the same CMB maps as were used
by Bleem et al. (2015) (hereafter B15); we summarise the salient
points here, and refer the reader to B15 for a complete description.
The SPT is a 10 m-diameter millimeter-wave telescope lo-
cated at the National Science Foundation Amundsen-Scott South
Pole Station in Antarctica. Between 2008 and 2011, the SPT was
used to observe a contiguous ∼2, 500 deg2 region of sky at 90 GHz,
150 GHz, and 220 GHz at arcminute resolution to approximate map
depths of 40, 18, and 70 µK-arcmin, respectively. The survey cov-
ers a region from 20h to 7h in right ascension (R.A.) and −65◦ to
−40◦ in declination (see e.g. Story et al. 2013). This analysis uses

between the g and r (r and i) bands. Right: We show in the upper panel the richness distribution, and in the lower panel the fractional uncertainty on the

for both components. Averaging over multiple pairs with the pair-
wise estimator (see Section 4.2 below), the tSZ signal will average
to zero (ignoring redshift dependence), allowing the kSZ signal to
be singled out. The kSZ contribution to the proﬁle normalisation,

their individual line-of-sight velocities ˆri · vi with the estimator

Here the geometrical factor cij accounts for the projection of the
pair separation rij ≡ ri − rj onto the line of sight, and the sum is
taken over all cluster pairs with i < j and distances |rij| = r. As a
reminder, v12(r) < 0 for clusters moving towards each other.

As the kSZ effect correlates the line-of-sight velocity of a clus-
ter with the CMB temperature T (ˆn) at its angular position ˆn, we
can combine equations 1 and 18 to form the pairwise kSZ estima-
tor (H12):

The Fourier-domain noise covariance N(l) includes the contri-
butions from nastro(x) and nnoise(x). The instrument and residual
atmosphere noise nnoise(x) is calculated by differencing pairs of
observations, then coadding the resulting difference-maps in each
ﬁeld of sky. The expected signal Sﬁlt(l) is calculated as the product
of the Fourier-domain cluster proﬁle template ρ(l) with B(l).
We explore ﬁlter sizes in the range θc ∈ [0.25(cid:48), 10(cid:48)]. For
the main analysis we adopt θc = 0.5(cid:48); the temperature estimates
obtained with this ﬁlter are shown in Fig. 3. This choice is well
matched to the average cluster extent (see Sections 5.3 and 6.2 be-
low). Furthermore, we have found it to yield the maximum signal-
to-noise ratio when extracting the pairwise kSZ signal from the
simulated CMB maps described in Section 5. The signiﬁcance of
our main result is relatively insensitive to the exact details of the
theoretical cluster proﬁle: the ﬁlter shape is dominated by CMB
confusion at large scales and the ∼1(cid:48) instrumental beam at small
scales, thus the cluster proﬁle impacts Ψ(x) over a relatively small
range of scales. We demonstrate the robustness of our detection to
the proﬁle size and shape in Section 6.2 below.

Residuals of the primary CMB, foreground and noise ﬂuctuations
are uncorrelated with cluster positions and hence add noise, but
average out in the pairwise measurement. The tSZ signal, as well
as cosmic infrared background (CIB) emission correlated with the
clusters, are also removed on average, thus adding noise but not
bias for clusters in a narrow redshift range.

Over a larger redshift range, however, any evolution of these
contributions with redshift would result in a bias. Indeed, we have
several known redshift-dependent components in our sample and
analysis: as discussed in Sections 3.1 and 6.3, the mass-selection
threshold of our sample evolves with redshift. Furthermore, the
adopted constant ﬁlter scale cannot match the average angular scale
of a cluster at all redshifts and so, even in the absence of a change
in the average cluster mass with z, the recovered temperature sig-
nal at the cluster positions will depend on redshift. These redshift-
dependent effects need to be subtracted to obtain an unbiased esti-
mate of the separation-dependent pairwise kSZ signal (H12, Planck
Collaboration 2015a). We estimate and remove this bias by calcu-
lating the mean measured temperature as a function of redshift and

The smoothed temperature at zi is calculated from the weighted
sum of contributions of clusters at redshift zj using a Gaussian ker-

nel G(zi, zj, Σz) = exp(cid:2)−(zi − zj)2/(cid:0)2Σ2

(cid:1)(cid:3). Here, we choose

z

Σz = 0.02, which results in smooth temperature evolution; we
have checked that our results are insensitive to this choice. We show
in Fig. 3 the smoothed temperature as a function of redshift, i.e. the
second term on the right-hand side of equation 20.
For the main sample analysed in this work, we ﬁnd only a
weak trend with redshift in the range 0.2 (cid:46) z (cid:46) 0.7; this is mainly
an effect of two competing processes: at low redshift, our sample is
nearly volume-limited, and as such it contains a higher number of
more massive clusters due to the progress of structure formation;
at higher redshift, our sample becomes ﬂux-limited, and by effect
of sample selection, more massive clusters are more likely to be
included in the sample. However, the amplitude of the kSZ signal
we are measuring is of the order of a few µK — much smaller than
the range of temperatures shown in Fig. 3. We show for clarity in
the bottom panel of Fig. 3 that the change in the mean tempera-
ture with z appears more considerable (∼15 µK) when drawn on a
temperature range that is closer to that of the kSZ measurements;
even such a weak trend with redshift could bias the results, if not
appropriately subtracted. The smoothed temperature is negative at
all redshifts due to thermal SZ, but removing an overall negative
offset does not affect the pairwise estimator.

After correcting for these redshift dependent effects as de-
scribed above, we measure the pairwise kSZ signal in 15 bins of
comoving pair separation linearly spaced between 0 and 300 Mpc.

4.3 Covariance estimates

The covariance of the pairwise kSZ measurement can be estimated
in a number of different ways. Analytic approaches for the covari-
ance of pairwise cluster velocities were presented by Bhattacharya
& Kosowsky (2008) and Mueller et al. (2015b), but further work is
necessary to realistically include contamination by primary CMB
anisotropies and the tSZ signal; the same holds true for the pairwise
velocity covariance that Ma et al. (2015) compute from simulations.
On the other hand, covariances derived from multiple mock realisa-
tions of the pairwise kSZ measurement generated from simulations
would be the most reliable technique, but this method becomes
computationally expensive for surveys that sample large volumes:
when preserving the survey geometry, only four independent pro-
jections of the DES-Y1×SPT-SZ footprint can be generated from
one full-sky kSZ simulation. Hence an unfeasibly large number of
simulated kSZ skies (and therefore N-body simulations) would be
required to obtain a reliable covariance estimation.

For these reasons, we adopt resampling techniques as our
baseline choice for computing the covariance matrix; this approach
also has the advantage of being model-independent. We create jack-
knife (JK) resamples of the pairwise kSZ measurement by splitting
the cluster catalogue into NJK subsamples, removing one of them,
and recomputing the pairwise kSZ amplitude from the union of the
remaining NJK−1 subsamples. This process is repeated until every

is the pairwise kSZ signal in separation bin i and JK re-

samples; we have checked that the covariance is stable when further
increasing NJK. In addition, we have also tested a JK approach us-
ing sky patches and bootstrap resampling from the cluster catalogue
and sky patches. We ﬁnd that all four techniques give comparable
results.

For the inverse of the covariance, we use the estimator

4.4 Amplitude ﬁts and statistical signiﬁcance

We ﬁt the pairwise kSZ signal measured with the estimator of equa-
tion 19 with a one-parameter template given by equation 11; the av-
erage optical depth of the cluster sample is ﬁt as a free parameter.
We then compute the statistical signiﬁcance of our measurement in
two different ways.

The statistical signiﬁcance of the template ﬁt is then computed as

In most of this paper, we treat the optical depth ¯τe as the effec-
tive amplitude of the extracted pairwise kSZ signal. We show in
Section 5.3 below that at our ﬁducial ﬁltering scale it can however
be interpreted as the physical optical depth along a line of sight
through the cluster centre.

Secondly, we also assess the signal signiﬁcance by calculating

the χ2 with respect to the no-signal hypothesis:

From the cumulative distribution function of the χ2 distribution
with the same number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) as our signal,
we infer the probability to exceed (PTE) the measured χ2
0 with a
purely random signal. Assuming Gaussian uncertainties, we then
translate the PTE into the signiﬁcance of the rejection of the no-
signal hypothesis.

We expect the template ﬁt to yield a higher statistical signif-
icance than the χ2
0 procedure: the template ﬁt includes the addi-
tional information of our analytic template, whereas the χ2
0 pro-
cedure makes no assumptions about the expected signal shape. As
there is a clear theoretical expectation for the pairwise kSZ signal,
we adopt the template ﬁt as our baseline choice, but also report the

5 SIMULATIONS
5.1 kSZ simulations

We use realistic mock data in order to demonstrate the accuracy of
our pairwise kSZ model and to estimate the impact of systematic
effects such as redshift errors and mis-centring. For these purposes,
we use the simulated tSZ and kSZ maps by Flender et al. (2015)
(hereafter F15). In the following we will brieﬂy summarise how
these maps were generated, and we refer the reader to F15 for de-
tails. We will further describe the post-processing steps that lead
from the full-sky maps and cluster catalogue to the realistic mock
data used in this analysis.

The CMB maps and cluster catalogue in F15 were generated
using the output from an N-body simulation that was run using
the N-body code framework HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Acceler-
ated Cosmology Code; Habib et al. 2016). This N-body simulation
is part of a suite of ∼100 simulations that are being carried out
under the Mira-Titan Universe project (Heitmann et al. 2015). The
initial conditions in this particular run adopt the cosmological pa-
rameters Ωc = 0.22, Ωbh2 = 0.02258, σ8 = 0.8, and h = 0.71,
which are consistent with the best-ﬁtting ΛCDM cosmology from
WMAP7 (Komatsu et al. 2011). When analysing the pairwise kSZ

7 We note that our approach to compute the S/N ratio of the measurement
is different from the one adopted by Keisler & Schmidt (2013), who deﬁne

the signiﬁcance as S/N = (cid:112)χ2. The latter is only a good approxima-

tion in the limit of very large χ2 per degree of freedom and signiﬁcantly
overestimates the S/N ratio if this assumption is not fulﬁlled.

signal from the simulations, we use these parameters to avoid bi-
ases due to an incorrect cosmological model.

F15 presented several models for the kSZ signal, all of which
were generated via post-processing of the N-body simulation out-
put, based on different assumptions about the intra-cluster gas.
Here, we use their “Model III”, which they consider to be the most
realistic model. It is created as follows: the cluster component of
the kSZ signal is generated by adding a gas component to each
halo, following the semi-analytic model of Shaw et al. (2010),
which takes into account star formation, feedback effects, as well
as non-thermal pressure. A diffuse gas component is added using
the positions and velocities of all particles outside haloes, assum-
ing that baryons trace the dark matter. The tSZ signal is modelled
in a similar way as the cluster component of the kSZ signal, using
the same semi-analytic model. We note that whereas in principle
the SZ maps could also be generated from a full hydrodynamical
simulation (e.g. Dolag & Sunyaev 2013; Dolag et al. 2015), cur-
rently available hydro-simulations do not provide the box size and
resolution required for our purposes.

In addition to the SZ maps, we generate a random realisa-
tion of the primary CMB anisotropies based on their angular power
spectrum computed with CAMB (using the same cosmological pa-
rameters as those used in the N-body simulation). We further
model Poisson noise from radio galaxies and dusty star-forming
galaxies, as well as the clustered component of the cosmic infrared
background as Gaussian random realisations, using the best-ﬁtting
model for their power spectra presented by George et al. (2015).

In order to generate realistic mock data we apply the following

post-processing steps to the full-sky maps from F15:

primary CMB, and foregrounds) onto the SPT ﬁelds.

• We project the full-sky CMB map (consisting of the SZ signal,
• We convolve each ﬁeld with the corresponding SPT beam and
ﬁlter transfer function (note that the SPT beam and ﬁltering de-
pends on the ﬁeld and the observation year).
• Finally, we add to each ﬁeld a random realisation of the instru-
mental noise in that ﬁeld. The noise realisations for each ﬁeld are
calculated directly from the data by randomly pairing all observa-
tions, subtracting one observation from the other in each pair, then
coadding the resulting difference maps.

We generate a mock cluster catalogue by applying the DES
mask to the full-sky cluster catalogue from F15. We further ap-
ply the same point-source mask as applied to the SPT-SZ data. For
choosing the appropriate mass range to match the redMaPPer cat-
alogue, we use the mass-richness relation that Saro et al. (2015)
infer from clusters found in both DES-SV and SPT: We compute
P (Mi|λi, zi) for every cluster i in the redMaPPer catalogue. Based
on the average mass distribution (cid:104)P (Mi|λi, zi)(cid:105)i, we then choose
a mass range of 0.9 < M500c/1014M(cid:12) < 4; this results in a
mock cluster catalogue with 6, 015 clusters in the redshift range
0.1 < z < 0.8. The latter is comparable to the number found in
the DES data with the corresponding richness range (6,693). The
number of clusters in the simulation and data catalogues are not
expected to match exactly both because of potential differences be-
tween the true and simulated cosmology and Poisson noise, as well
as some idealities we assume in our simulated cluster catalogue: in
our main analysis we apply a cut in mass in the simulation cata-
logue rather than explicitly modelling the purity and completeness
of the optically-selected cluster catalogue, and we ignore the scat-
ter in the mass-richness relation. We note that a substantial scatter-
ing of low-mass haloes into the sample could potentially bias our
results towards low optical depth. Therefore we test the impact of

MNRAS 000, 1–21 (2016)

mass scatter on our results by selecting an alternative sample where
we model this effect explicitly; see further discussion in Section 7.4
below.

5.2 kSZ model validation with simulations

Before proceeding to measure the pairwise kSZ on the data, we ap-
ply the estimators of equations 18, 19 to the kSZ simulations intro-
duced in Section 5.1, in order to validate the theoretical modelling
introduced in Section 2.

We ﬁrst show in Fig. 4 the mean pairwise velocity computed
from the cluster line-of-sight velocities with the estimator of equa-
tion 18, compared with the mean pairwise velocity model v12(r)
(equation 9) evaluated at the median redshift of zm (cid:39) 0.5. The in-
dividual r-bins of the simulation result are signiﬁcantly correlated,
especially for r (cid:38) 80 Mpc, where the elements of the correla-
(cid:46) 70 Mpc. We ﬁnd good agreement between our model and sim-
ulations for large and intermediate scales, i.e. for pair separations
r (cid:38) 40 Mpc (linear and mildly non-linear scales). Although the
template tends to marginally (∼10%) underestimate the pairwise
velocities on intermediate scales (r ∼ 100 Mpc), it is consistent
with the simulation result computed from the true line-of-sight ve-
locities within the statistical uncertainties. As presented below, the
uncertainties in the pairwise kSZ measured from current data are
several times larger, so that this level of accuracy does not intro-
duce a signiﬁcant bias into our results.
We note that at scales r (cid:46) 60 Mpc linear theory (the numer-
ator of equation 9) starts deviating from the full model, which pro-
vides a marginally better match to the shape of the signal measured
from simulations down to scales r ∼ 40 Mpc. At even smaller
scales, the model does not describe the simulation result accurately,
as also shown by Bhattacharya & Kosowsky (2008). This is not
surprising: we are probing the velocities of the highest peaks of
the density ﬁeld, so that perturbation theory cannot be expected to
provide accurate answers at small scales. We account for this by
excluding the separation bins r < 40 Mpc, where our template
deviates from the simulation result by more than 2σ, from the re-
mainder of this analysis. This exclusion is mainly relevant for the
simulation results that use the true redshifts, but has only small im-
pact when adding redshift uncertainties to the simulations or when
analysing the real data. The redshift errors in the latter completely
erase the signal at scales r (cid:46) 50 Mpc (see section 2.3 and below),
so that on the scales of interest for our analysis equation 9 provides
a good representation of the pairwise velocities.

We proceed by measuring the pairwise kSZ amplitude on the
simulations, applying the estimator of equations 19 and 20. To
disentangle the effect of photo-zs from other sources of uncer-
tainty, we ﬁrst demonstrate this procedure using kSZ-only simu-
lations. We ﬁt the pairwise kSZ signal measured from the simu-
lations with our template of equation 11 and show the results in
Fig. 5. Without added redshift errors — i.e. using the exact pair
separation — our template provides an excellent ﬁt to the mea-
sured signal; the best-ﬁtting amplitude is given by an optical depth
of ¯τe = (3.79 ± 0.26) · 10−3.
We next add photometric redshift uncertainties with rms σz =
{0.01, 0.015, 0.02}. This corresponds to an rms error in the co-
moving distance of σdc (cid:39) {35, 50, 65} Mpc; the central value is
comparable to the distance uncertainty of the typical DES cluster,
for which σdc (cid:39) 50 Mpc. Adapting the pair separation smooth-
ing scale accordingly (see Section 2.3), we repeat the kSZ template
ﬁt; these results are also displayed in Fig. 5. In all three cases, the

template, and hence our simple model for the effect of redshift un-
certainties (equation 11), provides a good ﬁt to the results com-
puted from simulations. Increasing the redshift errors signiﬁcantly
suppresses the signal on small scales (see Section 2.3), but with
the adapted template our estimates of ¯τe remain consistent with the
‘true-z’ result within the errors.

We ﬁnally show in Fig. 6 the kSZ results from the full sim-
ulations including noise, primary CMB, and tSZ. The individual
measurements and theory curves refer to, in order: the kSZ-only
simulation, a simulation with added primary CMB, noise, and fore-
grounds (but no thermal SZ8), our full mock catalogue (including
tSZ), and the full mock with added redshift uncertainties. This com-
parison serves two purposes: ﬁrstly, it shows that within the cur-
rent measurement uncertainties we recover an unbiased estimate
of the kSZ amplitude in the presence of potential contaminants.
Secondly, by adding a random realisation of the redshift uncertain-
ties, we obtain a realistic mock analogue of our measurement on
real data. From the latter, we obtain a best-ﬁtting optical depth of
¯τe = (4.34± 1.17)· 10−3, corresponding to a 3.7σ detection from
the mock catalogue. As we discuss in Section 6.1 below, the pair-
wise kSZ amplitude measured from the mocks is therefore con-
sistent with our main result obtained from the real data, although
with slightly higher uncertainties. This minor difference can be ex-
plained by the lower number of clusters compared to the real data,
in addition to other effects such as the difference between a richness
cut and a mass cut.

tion 7.2 below.

Figure 5. The effect of photo-z uncertainties on simulations: We show the
pairwise kSZ amplitude measured from kSZ-only simulations and the tem-
plate ﬁts including the photo-z model. The recovered pairwise kSZ signal
is shown for several levels of redshift errors; the corresponding solid line
and shaded region are the template ﬁt and its uncertainty. In all cases the
two lowest-separation points are excluded from the ﬁt as on these scales
perturbation theory is not valid (denoted by the open symbols in this and all
subsequent ﬁgures). The results for the optical depth in the ‘photo-z’ cases
are consistent with the ‘true-z’ results, demonstrating that redshift uncer-
tainties reduce the signiﬁcance but do not bias our results.

Figure 6. Pairwise kSZ measurements on realistic simulations: We show the
pairwise kSZ amplitude for mock clusters with 9 · 1013M(cid:12) < M500c <
4 · 1014M(cid:12), roughly corresponding to the DES 20 < ˜λ < 60 sample.
The black points are from a kSZ-only simulation, the blue colour shows the
results with added primary CMB, foregrounds and noise (but no tSZ) and
green refers to the full simulation. In the red case we additionally add red-
shift errors at a similar level as in the real data. Once again the best-ﬁtting
optical depth values remain consistent within the uncertainties, demonstrat-
ing that our estimate is unbiased.

We calculate ¯τ true

that a β-ﬁlter scale of θc = 0.5(cid:48) maximizes the detection S/N in the
simulations; thus this scale should roughly match the actual scale
in our cluster sample. Therefore, the matched ﬁlter with this scale
should return a reasonable estimate of the peak kSZ temperature
T0, which can be translated into the central optical depth. We test
this hypothesis by comparing the ‘true’ central optical depth, ¯τ true
to the match-ﬁltered central optical depth, ¯τ ﬁlt
, as explained below.
from equation 1. For every cluster in the
mock catalogue, we use the true amplitude T0 of the kSZ temper-
ature proﬁle computed as described in section 2.2 of F15, and the
proper line-of-sight velocity from the underlying N-body simula-
tion; ¯τ true
is then the slope of the best-ﬁt linear scaling relation be-
tween the two quantities. This approach is similar to the technique
proposed by Li et al. (2014) and used by Schaan et al. (2015); how-
ever, instead of reconstructing velocities from the observed density
ﬁeld, we use the actual velocities from the simulations, and further-
more the true kSZ signal instead of a ﬁltered CMB map. We obtain

We note that the changes in ¯τe appear instead more signiﬁ-

signiﬁcance measurements will require further work to improve the
pairwise kSZ modelling beyond the present accuracy level. A fur-
ther discussion of potential systematic uncertainties is given in Sec-
tion 7.

5.3 Physical interpretation of ¯τe

Throughout this paper, ¯τe is primarily used as an effective parame-
ter to characterize the amplitude of the measured signal and its de-
tection signiﬁcance. However, if the matched ﬁlter proﬁle is indeed
a good match to the average proﬁle of the clusters in the sample,
then ¯τe can potentially be interpreted as a physically meaningful
quantity: the average central optical depth. In Section 4.1 we found

estimated as described in Section 4.3. We show the corresponding
correlation matrix, which we ﬁnd to be nearly diagonal, in Fig. 8.
The signiﬁcance of this detection is estimated as described in
Section 4.4. Fitting the pairwise velocity template of equation 11 to
the measured data points yields an average optical depth of
¯τe = (3.75 ± 0.89) · 10
corresponding to a 4.2σ detection of the pairwise kSZ effect. This
measurement represents the ﬁrst detection of the kSZ using pho-
tometric redshift data. The signal is consistent with that obtained
from simulations: see Section 5.2 and Fig. 6. We discuss the impli-
cations of this result for cluster astrophysics in Section 8 below.

a lower signiﬁcance than the template ﬁt, which includes additional
information about the predicted shape of the pairwise kSZ signal.
However, even with the agnostic approach of the χ2

supports the (cid:39)4σ signiﬁcance of the template ﬁt.

6.2 Dependence on ﬁltering scale and proﬁle

In this section we explore how the detection signiﬁcance depends
on the details of the CMB ﬁltering we introduced in Section 4.1.
The top panel of Table 1 shows the dependence of the best-ﬁtting
optical depth on the ﬁlter scale, θc. A signiﬁcant (> 3σ) signal is
detected for ﬁlter scales up to θc = 2(cid:48); this is expected since the
instrumental beam dominates the ﬁlter shape for these small ﬁlters.
The recovered amplitude ¯τe drops monotonically with increasing
θc: in this sense ¯τe can be seen as an ‘effective parameter’ that
is sensitive to the ﬁltering scale. A physical interpretation of ¯τe is
nevertheless possible by using a ﬁltering scale that is matched to
the actual angular size of the cluster; in our case, this choice corre-
sponds to the θc = 0.5(cid:48) ﬁlter.9 We have established this possibility
of a physical interpretation in Section 5.3 and will discuss the im-
plications for cluster astrophysics in Section 8 below.

We further test whether the signal depends on the ﬁlter proﬁle
shape by replacing the β-proﬁle from equation 14 with a projected
Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) density proﬁle (Navarro et al.
1996). The 3D NFW proﬁle is given by

1

r/rs (1 + r/rs)2 ,

(28)
ρ(r) = ρ0
where r is the (3D) radius from the cluster centre and rs ≡
R500/c500 is the scale radius. Here, R500 is the radius inside which
the mass density of the halo is equal to 500 times the critical density
at the cluster redshift, and c500 is the dimensionless concentration
parameter. We set the latter to c500 = 3 based on the typical clus-
ter mass and redshift and the mass-concentration relation of Bhat-
tacharya et al. (2013). We use the analytic 2D projection of this
proﬁle given by Wright & Brainerd (2000), and parametrize the
angular scale in terms of θ500, the angular counterpart to R500. For
the clusters in our sample, we ﬁnd the mean θ500 to be around 2’.
In the bottom panel of Table 1 we show the optical depth mea-
sured using the NFW-proﬁle ﬁlter as a function of ﬁlter scale, θ500.
The signal behaves in essentially the same way as for the β-ﬁlter:
the amplitude decreases monotonically with increasing θ500. We
have tested NFW ﬁlters with θ500 ∈ [0.75(cid:48), 3.5(cid:48)], and obtain a sig-
niﬁcant detection with all of them. The relative size of the optical
depths obtained with the β- and NFW proﬁles is roughly consistent
with the expectation based on θ500 ∼ 5θc (e.g. Plagge et al. 2010;
Liu et al. 2015). Additionally, the maximum signiﬁcance for either
ﬁlter proﬁle is identical (4.4σ).

Finally, we have also investigated using an adaptive ﬁlter scale
based on the cluster radius and its angular diameter distance, and
have detected the signal at a comparable signiﬁcance. The results
of this section demonstrate that our detection signiﬁcance is not
sensitive to the details of the assumed cluster proﬁle.

6.3 Redshift dependence

At large scales, where linear perturbation theory holds, the pairwise
kSZ signal can be written as TpkSZ ∝ b ¯τe ξδv. The redshift evo-

a projected NFW proﬁle with concentration c200 (cid:39) 3.5 and θ200 (cid:39) 3(cid:48),
which are the mean NFW-parameters from the clusters in our main sample.

lution of the signal is thus driven by the evolution in bias, average
optical depth, and peculiar velocities of the cluster sample.
From the linearised continuity equation 4, it follows that pe-
culiar velocities grow as v ∝ a1/2 during matter domination. In
the standard cosmological model, this growth slows down and the
velocity ﬁeld decays at late times, where the cosmological constant
dominates. With our analysis, we are probing the redshift range in
the transition between these two regimes. To ﬁrst approximation,
we can thus assume that the peculiar velocities do not evolve sig-
niﬁcantly with redshift. This simple argument is conﬁrmed by eval-
uating the full redshift dependence of ξδv(r, z) from equation 5.
On large scales, and in the redshift range considered here, we ﬁnd
ξδv(r, z) to be within ∼20% from its value at the median redshift
of zm (cid:39) 0.5.

Secondly, the growth of clusters leads to an increased mean
optical depth towards low redshifts. On the other hand, if we ap-
ply a constant mass threshold to a sample that is entirely complete
and pure, we would be selecting objects that are more strongly bi-
ased at high redshift. In this somewhat idealistic case, these differ-
ent effects inﬂuence the pairwise kSZ amplitude in opposite direc-
tions and would therefore partially cancel, leading to a relatively
weak redshift evolution. However, as explained in Section 3.1, the
high-redshift end of the cluster sample is still partially affected by
Malmquist bias (increasing the effective richness threshold) and
Eddington bias (decreasing the effective threshold by scattering
lower-richness objects into the sample). Furthermore, the richness-
mass relation can also evolve with redshift. A better theoretical un-
derstanding of the redshift evolution of the measured pairwise kSZ
signal would require a detailed modelling of all of these effects,
which is beyond the scope of this work.

We ﬁrst test our expectation for the redshift evolution with our
mock catalogue, i.e. for the case of a complete and pure sample. For
this purpose, we split the sample at the median redshift of zm (cid:39) 0.5
and recompute the pairwise kSZ amplitude from the two bins. In-
deed we ﬁnd that the two measured amplitudes are comparable. We
then proceed to the measurement on real data, where additionally
the sample selection effects mentioned above could inﬂuence the
redshift dependence. We show in Fig 10 the results for the two red-
shift bins: we obtain ¯τe = (4.44 ± 1.54) · 10−3 (2.9σ template
ﬁt signiﬁcance) from the low-redshift bin, whereas from the high-
redshift bin we ﬁnd ¯τe = (3.71 ± 1.63) · 10−3 (2.3σ template
ﬁt signiﬁcance). The amplitudes from the two bins are comparable
and in good agreement with our main result of equation 27. We
further note that the combined signiﬁcance of the two bins (3.7σ)
is slightly lower than the main result with only one redshift bin be-
cause the redshift split removes all pairs with radial separations that
cross the redshift boundary.

Given the measurement uncertainties on our data, there is no
evidence that ¯τe evolves signiﬁcantly with redshift. If future data
(see also Section 9 below) provides sufﬁciently large, volume-
limited cluster catalogues, the signal could be measured in multiple
redshift bins with higher precision. This would yield signiﬁcantly
tighter constraints on the redshift evolution of the pairwise kSZ,
and hence of the peculiar velocity ﬁeld, than currently possible.

6.4 Richness limits
In general, the mean optical depth should scale roughly as ¯τe ∝
¯M ∝ ¯λ, where ¯M and ¯λ are the mean mass and richness of
the cluster sample. Including clusters with lower richness into the
sample increases the number counts signiﬁcantly, but at the price
of a higher uncertainty in purity, centring, and photometric red-

sponding to 10 < ˜λ < 20) separately, we ﬁnd a similar behaviour.
These observations support the hypothesis that mis-centring and
imperfections in the cluster catalogue are non-negligible at the low-
mass end. Additionally, given the increased level of redshift uncer-
tainty in the 10 < ˜λ < 60 sample, it is not surprising that we do
not ﬁnd a more signiﬁcant detection from these clusters.

We have also explored other lower richness limits, such as ˜λ >
15, which approximately splits the 10 < ˜λ < 60 sample into a low-
richness and high-richness half. Our ﬁndings are consistent with
the trend we have observed from the two main samples: including
clusters with ˜λ < 20 signiﬁcantly reduces the optical depth and
does not improve the overall S/N ratio.

Finally, we have explored raising the lower richness thresh-
old and found that this also does not enhance the overall S/N ratio,
mainly because of the signiﬁcant reduction in cluster number. As
an example, we have measured the kSZ signal from the 2,324 clus-
ters with 30 < ˜λ < 60. We ﬁnd ¯τe = (5.16 ± 2.20) · 10−3, corre-
sponding to a 2.3σ detection. The optical depth is about 40% higher
than in our main sample; the change is consistent with the expecta-
tion based on the increased mean cluster mass. This indicates that
imperfections in the cluster catalogue such as mis-centring do not
further decrease signiﬁcantly when increasing the lower richness
threshold beyond ˜λ = 20. Also, the photo-z performance does not
improve signiﬁcantly any more; we ﬁnd only a ∼10% decrease in
the rms distance uncertainty compared to the main sample. Fur-
thermore, we have studied the 20 < ˜λ < 30 sample containing
4,369 clusters. Again we obtain a relatively weak detection, but
the change in the optical depth is consistent with the expectation.
Overall, the results of this section demonstrate that ˜λ = 20 is as
good choice for the lower richness limit for kSZ studies with cur-
rent cluster data.

7 TESTS FOR SYSTEMATICS

In this section, we perform multiple tests to estimate the effects of
potential systematics on our result. First we carry out a set of null
tests using the real data. Subsequently, we test for contamination
by thermal SZ, centring uncertainties and mass scatter using the
simulations. We show a compilation of the test results in Table 2.
Finally, we brieﬂy list and discuss other potential systematics, such
as position-dependent foregrounds in the optical catalogue. Over-
all, we ﬁnd that none of the systematic candidates considered has
a signiﬁcant effect on our results, given the current measurement
uncertainties.

7.1 Null tests

We ﬁrst produce null tests by modifying the pairwise estimator
(equation 19) in three simple ways. The results of these null tests

ters in the sample. In this case, the result of the template ﬁt is
¯τe = (1.37 ± 0.41) · 10−3. The best-ﬁtting optical depth has de-
creased by a factor of (cid:39)3 compared to the ﬁducial 20 < ˜λ < 60
sample, which is a stronger trend than one would expect based on
the simple scaling given above. This steeper decrease could point
to mis-centring or impurities in the cluster catalogue being more
pronounced in the low-mass sample. On the other hand, as the
number of clusters is larger, the error on ¯τe is smaller as well, so
that the overall signiﬁcance (3.4σ) is broadly comparable to the
higher-mass sample. Despite the large increase in number counts,
the low-λ sample does not add to the detection signiﬁcance of
the main sample, and indeed there is only marginal signal in the
10 < ˜λ < 20 range: here we ﬁnd ¯τe = (0.77 ± 0.39) · 10−3.
To compare the 10 < ˜λ < 60 sample from the DES data
to simulations, we select a sample with 4 · 1013M(cid:12) < M500c <
4 · 1014M(cid:12) from our mock catalogue. It contains ∼28, 000 clus-
ters, which is comparable to the number in the 10 < ˜λ < 60 sam-
ple. We further simulate photometric redshifts by adding random
errors with rms σz = 0.02, which is comparable to the photo-z un-
certainty in the real data. From this sample we obtain a best-ﬁtting
optical depth of ¯τe = (2.66±0.68)·10−3, corresponding to a ∼4σ
detection. While the detection signiﬁcance is comparable to the real
data, the value of ¯τe from the simulations is somewhat higher, and
consistent with the expectation based on the mass limits. When
analysing the 4 · 1013M(cid:12) < M500c < 9 · 1013M(cid:12) range (corre-

measurement is small given the present statistical uncertainties.

of random positions. For this purpose, we use random points pro-
duced with the redMaPPer algorithm by creating random {z, λ}
pairs from the real catalogue and assigning random positions on
the sky to them, while ensuring that they cover the same volume
and have the same distribution in richness and redshift as the origi-
nal catalogue (Rykoff et al. 2016). We then apply the same cuts and
process the random points with the same analysis steps as for the
real data before estimating the pairwise kSZ amplitude. This test
0 ≈ 4 (15 d.o.f.), so it is fully consistent with a null signal.
yields χ2
The success of these three null tests demonstrates that there are no
obvious systematic contaminants affecting our measurement.

7.2 Contamination by the tSZ effect

On individual clusters the kSZ signal is only a subdominant contri-
bution to the millimeter-wave signal, which is instead dominated by
primary CMB, noise residuals, and the thermal SZ component. The
primary CMB and noise are uncorrelated with cluster positions, and
they would therefore already average out in a stacking analysis,
whereas the thermal SZ component is only removed by the pair-
wise estimator (equation 19). This cancellation might however be
insufﬁcient for the most massive clusters, as these are rare objects
and have the highest tSZ temperature decrement. For this reason we
have excluded the most massive clusters (˜λ > 60) from the sample
and hence we do not expect a high degree of tSZ contamination.
Nonetheless, we test for this possible systematic by processing a
mock CMB data set with all components except for the tSZ com-
ponent through the same pipeline as before, in order to estimate the
impact of the tSZ to our measurement.

The comparison of the result from the ‘kSZ-only’, the ‘full
CMB’ and the ‘no tSZ’ mocks were shown in Fig. 6 above, and
are summarised in Table 2 for convenience. Here we ﬁnd that the
measured optical depth from the ‘no tSZ’ case is in excellent agree-
ment with the ‘kSZ-only’ model, whereas the full mock yields a
marginally higher result (0.8σ using the true redshifts, reducing to
0.5σ when adding redshift uncertainties); nevertheless all three are

are shown in Fig. 11: in all three cases, the best-ﬁtting optical depth
is consistent with zero within the 1σ uncertainties.

(1) We replace the minus sign in the estimator with a plus to
remove the sensitivity to the pairwise kSZ signal (H12). The result
is consistent with a null signal (χ2

0 ≈ 15 for 15 d.o.f.).

(2) We randomly shufﬂe the clusters before estimating the
pairwise kSZ amplitude, but keep the same weights cij as in the
unshufﬂed case (see H12). We have already shown in Fig. 9 a his-
togram of the best ﬁtting amplitude of 1,000 realisations of this
shufﬂing; the results are consistent with a null signal. Furthermore,

tested the impact of including the high-mass clusters on the degree
of tSZ contamination. We ﬁnd that including them reduces the over-
all signal-to-noise, but still tSZ contamination does not cause our
result for the optical depth to be substantially biased. Therefore we
conclude that, with the currently available data, tSZ contamination
is not a signiﬁcant issue for the pairwise kSZ measurement.

7.3 Centring uncertainties

Offsets between the cluster centre derived from optical data and the
centre of the SZ emission have the potential of diluting the pairwise
kSZ signal. This mis-centring can happen for clusters in which the
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is not at the location of the potential
minimum, such as in unrelaxed or merging clusters. Furthermore,
there are cases where the galaxy labelled as the central galaxy by
the redMaPPer algorithm is not truly the BCG. Here, we test the
impact of mis-centring on the measurement of ¯τe by introducing
random offsets into the mock cluster catalogue.

Following F15, we consider here two different mis-centring
models. Our ﬁrst mis-centring model follows Johnston et al. (2007),
where we assume that a fraction fJ = 0.75 of clusters in the
sample have the correct centre, and a fraction 1 − fJ of clusters
are mis-centred, following a 2D-Gaussian distribution with width
σJ = 300 h−1kpc (see F15 for a discussion of the choice of the
parameters fJ and σJ). The second mis-centring model adopts the
best-ﬁtting parameters of the model by Saro et al. (2015), which
characterises the offset distribution as a 2-component Gaussian dis-
tribution. We show in Table 2 the best-ﬁtting optical depth mea-
sured from simulations where we have introduced random offsets
in the cluster positions according to these two mis-centring models.
In agreement with F15, we ﬁnd that for both models mis-centring
reduces the pairwise kSZ amplitude by (cid:46) 10%, which is not sig-
niﬁcant given the error bars in our measurement. We therefore con-
clude that mis-centring at the level suggested by the models con-
sidered here is not a signiﬁcant problem for our analysis. We note
however that for more precise measurements of the pairwise kSZ
amplitude in the future, a better understanding of the mis-centring
distribution and potentially a correction of this small bias will be
necessary.

7.4 Mass scatter

In order to obtain a good match between the optical cluster cat-
alogue (selected in richness) and the mock catalogue (selected in
mass), an accurate knowledge of the mass range and average mass
of the cluster sample is required. Furthermore, the calculation of the
theory template also requires a mass range. If incompleteness and
impurities in the catalogue or a large scatter in the mass-richness
relation substantially affect the typical cluster mass in the optical
catalogue, the inferred optical depth could be biased, both with re-
spect to the true value and the simulations. In this work we have
selected our sample based on the mass-richness relation calibrated

10 We note that this small, but non-zero degree of tSZ contamination could
also be caused by a chance correlation in our particular simulated realisa-
tion. This could be studied in more detail only with multiple independent
realisations of simulated tSZ and kSZ signals, which is computationally ex-
pensive, and beyond the scope of the present work (see also Section 4.3).

Detection of the kSZ effect with DES and SPT

by Saro et al. (2015), who also accounted for scatter in the rela-
tion, ﬁnding good agreement between the optical depth from the
real data and simulations.

To further test for the impact of scatter in the mass-richness
relation, we use an alternative approach for selecting our mock
sample: here we explicitly model the scatter by adding a loga-
rithmic mass error drawn from a normal distribution with width
σln M = 0.3 to the masses in our catalogue and selecting the
sample based on this ‘observed’ mass. We use a mass range of
1 < M500c/1014M(cid:12) < 3, where the lower and upper limits cor-
responds roughly to λ = 20 and λ = 60, respectively (e.g. Rykoff
et al. 2012). We then recompute the pairwise kSZ amplitude from
the alternative sample. To be able to disentangle the effect of the
mass scatter from the photometric redshift uncertainties, we do not
add additional photo-z errors here. Averaging over several realisa-
tions of the mass scatter, we ﬁnd ¯τe = (3.56± 0.86)· 10−3, which
is ∼1σ lower than the result with our main sample. However, when
adding redshift errors, the uncertainties on the pairwise kSZ am-
plitude increase, so that the difference between the two samples
reduces to ∼0.7σ (see Table 2).

We further note that our main sample was not selected in the
richness λ, but in the galaxy counts ˜λ (see Section 3.1). This more
conservative cut tends to remove clusters with large richness un-
certainties even if they have λ > 20 (see top right panel of Fig. 2).
Therefore it is not surprising that our result for the optical depth
slightly decreases if we directly translate a lower richness bound of
λ = 20 into a mass limit. Finally, our result for ¯τe from the data
is consistent with both the main and the alternative mock sample
within the uncertainties. Therefore, we conclude that given the cur-
rent measurement uncertainties mass scatter does not introduce a
statistically signiﬁcant bias into our results.

7.5 Other potential systematics

We ﬁnally discuss other systematic effects that could potentially
affect the pairwise kSZ measurement and bias our estimate of ¯τe.

(1) The calculation of the pairwise velocity template relies on
several assumptions, such as the validity of the model in the quasi-
linear regime, a prescription for the halo bias, and a negligible ve-
locity bias. We have shown that our theory template is accurate to
within ∼10% (see Fig. 4), signiﬁcantly below the current measure-
ment uncertainties, so that we discard remaining model inaccura-
cies as a potential source of signiﬁcant bias.

(2) Additionally, when relating the mean pairwise velocity to
the pairwise kSZ signal in equation 3, we implicitly assume that
there are no strong correlations between the velocities and optical
depths of individual clusters, such that the average (cid:104)vτe(cid:105) effectively
reduces to (cid:104)v(cid:105)×(cid:104)τe(cid:105). We have shown in Section 5.3 that the optical
depth measured from the pairwise kSZ is consistent with the true
optical depth of the cluster sample. Therefore this assumption does
not bias our results given the current measurement uncertainties.

(3) As described in Section 2.3, we have heuristically mod-
elled the effect of photometric redshift uncertainties on the pairwise
kSZ signal. We have shown in Section 5.2 that given the current
measurement uncertainties this simple model is sufﬁcient to obtain
results that are unbiased within the uncertainties.

(4) Finally, position-dependent foregrounds of the optical cat-
alogue, such as Galactic extinction, seeing, airmass and sky bright-
ness, can contaminate the cluster sample, thus potentially affecting
the results. We describe in Appendix A a number of tests we have
performed on these potential systematics, and we demonstrate that
their impact is negligible.

16

B. Soergel, S. Flender, K. Story et al.

We therefore conclude that at the signiﬁcance level reported
here, these potential systematics are not signiﬁcant. With the pre-
cision measurements that are likely to be achieved with future data
however (see e.g. F15 for a forecast), more careful quantiﬁcations
and corrections will be required.

8 IMPLICATIONS FOR CLUSTER ASTROPHYSICS

As described in Section 2.4, the pairwise kSZ amplitude is sensi-
tive to a combination of astrophysical and cosmological parame-
ters, namely b¯τe × f σ2
8, where b is the cluster bias, ¯τe is the mean
central optical depth of the cluster sample, f is the growth rate
of density perturbations, and σ8 is the current rms linear matter
ﬂuctuation on scales of 8 h−1Mpc. In principle, it is possible to
combine a measurement of the pairwise kSZ amplitude with ex-
ternal constraints on b (e.g. from a clustering measurement) and
¯τe (from the thermal SZ signal or X-ray observations) to derive
constraints on f σ2
8. The latter could be used as a test of gravity,
complementary to other probes such as redshift-space distortions.
At the current detection signiﬁcance, however, the resulting cos-
mological constraints would be weak and strongly degenerate with
the still relatively uncertain cluster astrophysics. We have therefore
ﬁxed the cosmological parameters to the ﬁducial Planck 2015 val-
ues of the base ΛCDM model11 and have used the measurement of
the pairwise kSZ signal to place constraints on the average optical
depth of the cluster sample, ¯τe. As discussed in Section 5.3, physi-
cal interpretations of ¯τe are only considered at the ﬁducial ﬁltering
scale θc = 0.5(cid:48).

We ﬁrst compare our results for the optical depth to those ob-
tained by Planck Collaboration (2015a) when extracting the kSZ
signal by cross-correlation with reconstructed velocities. For our
ﬁducial ﬁltering scale of θc = 0.5(cid:48), we have obtained a value
of ¯τe = (3.75 ± 0.89) · 10−3. This is signiﬁcantly larger than
¯τe = (1.4 ± 0.5) · 10−4 found by Planck Collaboration (2015a).
The difference is however not surprising: the Planck analysis uses
a catalogue of around 260,000 central galaxies, whose typical host
halo masses are signiﬁcantly below the mass range used in this
work. Furthermore, the authors of Planck Collaboration (2015a)
used aperture photometry (as opposed to a matched ﬁlter), thus the
signiﬁcantly broader beam of Planck (FWHM 5(cid:48) − 7(cid:48) for the maps
used) dilutes the SZ signal over a much larger area, resulting in a
lower effective optical depth.

Next, we study the behaviour of ¯τe as a function of the
matched-ﬁlter scale; this probes the spatial extent of the average
cluster proﬁle. Our main result, ¯τe = (3.75 ± 0.89) · 10−3, is de-
rived using a matched ﬁlter that follows a β-proﬁle with θc = 0.5(cid:48),
which corresponds roughly to the average cluster proﬁle in our
sample. Here we vary the ﬁlter scale and plot the best-ﬁtting ¯τe
as a function of ﬁlter scale in the top panel of Fig. 12. As already
demonstrated in Section 6.2, the pairwise kSZ amplitude decreases
with increasing ﬁlter scale as the ﬁlter essentially averages over a
region larger than the cluster. This trend ﬂattens off at θc ≈ 1(cid:48); for
larger θc we measure a roughly constant value of ¯τe (cid:39) 2 · 10−3.

The signal-to-noise ratio of the measurement is displayed in
the bottom panel of Fig. 12, where the shaded band indicates the
uncertainties caused by the random realisations of the photometric
redshift errors. We detect the signal with S/N ≥ 3 out to θc = 3(cid:48);

11 We have tested that the change of the theory template when varying
the cosmology is subdominant compared to the measurement uncertainties.
Therefore there is no need to marginalise over the cosmological parameters.

measurement from DES×SPT (red) and our mock catalogues (blue). The
dashed vertical line marks our ﬁducial ﬁltering scale of θc = 0.5(cid:48). Top: We
show the best-ﬁtting optical depth, in the case of the simulations averaged
over 40 random realisations of the photo-z errors. Bottom: The lines rep-
resent the detection signiﬁcance ¯τe/σ¯τe for both data and simulations. For
the latter we additionally show the scatter caused by the random realisations
of the photo-z errors: the shaded regions in dark (light) blue are the 68%
(95%) conﬁdence regions estimated from the scatter of the realisations.

even at θc = 10(cid:48) there is still a marginal detection (S/N (cid:39) 2).
The behaviour of the signal-to-noise as a function of ﬁlter scale is
consistent with the expectations from the simulations, i.e. there is
no evidence in the data for an additional ionized gas component
that is not included in the astrophysical model.

As shown in the Section 5.3, our result for ¯τe is a good es-
timate of the true average optical depth when using our ﬁducial
ﬁltering scale of θc = 0.5(cid:48). Therefore we can convert it into the av-
erage gas fraction fgas as follows: the matched ﬁlter estimates the
central amplitude of the temperature proﬁle, hence ¯τe corresponds
to the optical depth along a line of sight through the centre of the
cluster. The central electron density ne,0 is therefore related to ¯τe

As ne(r) ∝ r−3 for large r, this integral has a logarith-

for the NFW proﬁle). The number of electrons associated with
a cluster is of course ﬁnite; the divergence merely reﬂects the
fact that for sufﬁciently large radii the gas proﬁle will deviate
from the simple functional form of the β-proﬁle. Here we trun-
cate the integrals in equations 29 and 30 at a ﬁxed physical ra-
dius given by the mean R500 (w.r.t. critical density) of our mock
cluster sample, (cid:104)R500(cid:105) (cid:39) 0.65 Mpc. The gas fraction within
R500 is then computed as fgas = Neµemp/ ¯M, where mp is the
proton mass and the mean particle weight per electron is given
by µe = 1.17 assuming primordial abundances. We further use
¯M = (cid:104)M500(cid:105) (cid:39) 1.4 · 1014M(cid:12), which is the mean mass of the
clusters in our mock catalogue.

which is in good agreement with the values suggested by X-ray ob-
servations of clusters in a similar mass range (e.g. Vikhlinin et al.
2006; Arnaud et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2009; Giodini et al. 2009) and
recent results from hydrodynamical simulations (e.g. McCarthy
et al. 2016). From the simulations by F15 analysed in this work,
gas = 0.086 ± 0.027 (stat.). In addi-
we infer a gas fraction of f 500
tion to these statistical errors, systematic uncertainty arises from
determining the central optical depth ¯τe via the pairwise kSZ mea-
surement, and from converting the latter into the gas fraction. Con-
cerning the former, Section 5.3 demonstrated that in simulations,
we recover the ‘true’ optical depth to within statistical uncertain-
ties. Regarding the conversion to gas fraction, the ‘true’ value of
fgas in the simulations is given by the ﬁducial model of Shaw et al.
(2010), which was used to generate the kSZ simulations used here;
gas (cid:39) 0.09 for the clusters in the mass range
this model predicts f 500
considered here (see Fig. 4 in that work). Our results from simula-
tions and also from the real data are in good agreement with this
value.
However, our choice of proﬁle and integration radius are
somewhat arbitrary. Integrating to R = (cid:104)R200(cid:105) (cid:39) 1 Mpc, and
using ¯M = (cid:104)M200(cid:105) (cid:39) 2.2 · 1014M(cid:12), we obtain f 200
gas = 0.070 ±
gas = 0.076±0.023 (stat.) from
0.016 (stat.) from the data and f 200
the simulations. These values are slightly smaller than the corre-
sponding results for f 500
gas . This is against the expectation of a grow-
ing gas fraction with increasing R, and could indicate that the sim-
ple β-proﬁle does not describe the kSZ signal from the cluster out-
skirts accurately (see also Vikhlinin et al. 2006 for similar ﬁndings
from X-ray data). Our results for f 200
gas are also in some tension with
simulation results by Battaglia et al. (2013) and extrapolations from
X-ray observations of clusters (Mantz et al. 2014), which points to
the limitations of our simple calculation of fgas. We reiterate here
that the assumed proﬁle shape is a signiﬁcant source of systematic
uncertainty in our measurement of fgas, and extracted fgas values
are only valid where the proﬁle is a good match to the actual cluster
proﬁle. An alternative, equally valid choice would be to replace the
β-proﬁle with the appropriate NFW proﬁle matched to our sample
(see Section 6.2); however, the NFW proﬁle diverges for r → 0, so
that the simple integration of equation 29 would require a further
regularisation in the cluster centre.

Future kSZ studies with improved CMB and/or cluster data
will need to address these limitations, but have the potential to
study cluster astrophysics in signiﬁcantly more detail. In particu-
lar, high-signiﬁcance kSZ detections would allow to place tighter
constraints on the gas fraction, both as a function of cluster mass
and distance from the cluster centre.

9 CONCLUSIONS

The pairwise kSZ signal is a probe of the mean relative velocities of
galaxy clusters and, as such, it has the potential to provide impor-
tant information about both cosmology and cluster astrophysics. In
this work, we have presented a detection of the pairwise kSZ signal
with a statistical signiﬁcance of 4.2σ by combining a cluster sam-
ple obtained from the ﬁrst year of DES data with CMB temperature
maps at 150 GHz from the SPT-SZ survey. This is the ﬁrst detection

of the kSZ effect using cluster redshifts derived from photometric
data.12
Our main results are based on a catalogue of galaxy clus-
ters selected with the redMaPPer algorithm on the ∼1,200 deg2 of
DES-Y1 data that overlap with the SPT-SZ survey. We have used
clusters within the richness range 20 < ˜λ < 60 and redshift range
0.1 < z < 0.8, in combination with CMB temperature maps from
the SPT that have been match-ﬁltered to extract an estimate for the
SZ signal at the position of the clusters. In parallel to the measure-
ment on these data, we have repeated the analysis on a set of mock
cluster catalogues and CMB maps derived from a new suite of high-
resolution kSZ simulations, introduced by Flender et al. (2015).

In both data and simulations, the temperature estimates at the
positions of individual clusters are dominated by thermal SZ and
primary CMB, foregrounds and noise residuals. We have removed
these contaminants statistically with a differential measurement
that isolates the pairwise kSZ signal. We have then ﬁt the recovered
signal with an analytic template that models the mean pairwise ve-
locity on linear and mildly non-linear scales and incorporates the
effect of photo-z uncertainties. Given a set of cosmological param-
eters and a prescription for the halo bias, this template completely
speciﬁes the shape of the pairwise kSZ signal. Its amplitude, the
only free parameter, is given by the average central optical depth of
the cluster sample under consideration. For the main sample used
in this work, we have measured ¯τe = (3.75 ± 0.89) · 10−3, corre-
sponding to a 4.2σ detection of the pairwise kSZ signal. Using the
simulations, we have validated this procedure, ﬁnding that it recov-
ers the ‘true’ mean optical depth within the statistical uncertainties.
We have tested the robustness of the signal to the details of the
analysis: we have detected the signal at comparable signiﬁcance
over a broad range of ﬁltering scales, and for two different assump-
tions about the cluster gas proﬁle. Furthermore, we have split the
main sample into two redshift bins and have detected the pairwise
kSZ effect in both of them, with no evidence of an evolution of
the kSZ amplitude with redshift. When extending the sample to
lower-richness clusters, we have obtained a detection at a slightly
lower signiﬁcance despite the much larger number of clusters. This
is likely caused by the higher level of impurities and incomplete-
ness in the optical catalogue, as well as higher centring uncertain-
ties and photometric redshift errors in this sample. The combination
of these effects is currently the main limitation for the statistical
signiﬁcance of our measurement.

Additionally, we have demonstrated with an extensive set of
null tests that our result is not signiﬁcantly affected by systematic
uncertainties. We have explicitly tested for the effect of extinction
by Galactic dust and for a range of spatially varying DES observing
conditions. Based on the simulated catalogues, we have also inves-
tigated the effect of centring errors, thermal SZ contamination and
mass uncertainties, ﬁnding that they do not cause any signiﬁcant
bias for our main result.

As an astrophysical application of our measurement, we have
studied the optical depth as a function of the scale of the matched
ﬁlter and found a consistent behaviour between the data and the
simulations, indicating that the data are in agreement with the as-
trophysical model used in the simulations. At our ﬁducial ﬁltering
scale of θc = 0.5(cid:48), we have translated the central optical depth into

On-going and upcoming observational campaigns will pro-
vide larger and deeper cluster catalogues, as well as CMB maps
to higher sensitivity, with which the pairwise kSZ signal will be
detectable at high signiﬁcance: a cluster catalogue corresponding
to our current 10 < ˜λ < 60 sample, but with spectroscopic red-
shifts, would result in a ∼9σ detection of the pairwise kSZ effect
with current CMB data. A more accurate modelling of v12(r) on
smaller scales (see e.g. Sugiyama et al. 2015), enabling the use of
separations r < 40 Mpc, would further enhance the detection sig-
niﬁcance. Another potential analysis improvement, relevant for fu-
ture data sets, would be an additional weighting of clusters pairs in
the pairwise estimator, based on their expected contribution to the
signal given their two masses. The extra weighting could reduce
the scatter in the estimated pairwise signal caused by large vari-
ations in cluster masses, which would be particularly relevant for
future analyses pushing towards lower mass thresholds and hence
spanning a broader range in cluster masses.

Future spectroscopic cluster catalogues with lower mass lim-
its (and thus larger sample sizes) will enable a vast increase in
the kSZ detection signiﬁcance. The possibilities for photo-z cata-
logues, however, are currently limited by the redshift uncertainties,
but could improve substantially if deeper imaging data (from e.g.
the full depth DES survey or, in the longer term, the Large Syn-
optic Survey Telescope; LSST Science Collaboration et al. 2009)
also leads to improved photo-z performance. An interesting mid-
dle ground between high-resolution spectroscopic and broad-band
photometric surveys will be covered by narrow-band photometric
surveys such as PAU (Martí et al. 2014) and J-PAS (Benitez et al.
2014) and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys such as SPHEREX
(Doré et al. 2014). However, kSZ analyses from future photometric
or low-resolution spectroscopic data might require a more sophisti-
cated modelling of the effect of photo-z uncertainties to ensure that
the results stay unbiased within their signiﬁcantly reduced uncer-
tainties.

Next-generation CMB experiments like SPT-3G (covering the
same region as SPT-SZ, but to much lower noise levels; see Ben-
son et al. 2014) and AdvACTPol (covering ∼15, 000 deg2, but
not as deeply as SPT-3G; see e.g. Calabrese et al. 2014) should
measure the kSZ signal with dramatically increased precision. In
contrast to the single-frequency analysis presented here, the deep
multi-frequency data of these experiments could be combined to
further isolate the kSZ signal from noise and tSZ contamination.
F15 forecast that by combining AdvACTPol with spectroscopic
clusters from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI,
Levi et al. 2013), the pairwise kSZ could be detected at the 20σ
level; this number increases to 27 − 57σ in the optimistic sce-
nario where the kSZ can be separated from the other components.
Similar signiﬁcances are possible when SPT-3G is combined with
a cluster catalogue reaching down to M500c ∼ 3 · 1013M(cid:12) and
σz/(1 + z) (cid:39) 0.003, which could be achieved by narrow-band
photometric surveys (see e.g. Martí et al. 2014; Benitez et al. 2014).
If the potential systematic uncertainties (such as tSZ contam-
ination, mis-centring and mass-scatter) that we have discussed in
Sections 7.2 to 7.5 can be accurately determined and modelled,
these future measurements will allow for a ∼5% (∼2% optimisti-
cally) constraint on the cosmological and astrophysical parameters
that determine the pairwise kSZ amplitude. A joint analysis of pair-
wise kSZ measurements with other probes would then be a valu-
able ingredient for precision cosmology and cluster astrophysics:
the combination of kSZ with X-ray and tSZ data could provide

valuable insight into cluster proﬁles and the gas fraction, whereas
a combination of the kSZ signal with other cosmological observ-
ables such as galaxy clustering and redshift-space distortions could
measure the growth rate with high precision and hence tighten the
constraints on dark energy or modiﬁed gravity.

APPENDIX A: TESTS FOR POSITION-DEPENDENT
OBSERVATIONAL SYSTEMATICS

In this appendix, we test for spatially-varying systematics in the
optical catalogue that could bias the kSZ measurement. Although
these are taken into account during the production of the cluster cat-
alogue, there could be residual correlation of these systematics with
properties of the catalogue, which could cause a contamination of
the signal. Given that the pairwise kSZ estimation is most sensitive
to pairs along the line of sight, we expect a possible contamination
by these effects to be small. Nevertheless, here we test the stability
of our results with respect to a selection of these contaminants, to
ensure the robustness of our signal. In particular, we consider: ex-
tinction by Galactic dust as quantiﬁed by the EB−V map produced
by Planck Collaboration (2014), seeing, airmass, and sky bright-
ness. For the latter three we use the i-band systematics maps pro-
duced within the DES collaboration using the approach described
by Leistedt et al. (2015) for the SV area.

To test for a correlation of our results with these system-
the cluster posi-
atic candidates, we measure their values at
tions. We then recompute the pairwise kSZ amplitude from the
{98%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 50%} of the clusters with the best value in
the systematic candidate under consideration. The results are given
in the left panel of Table A1. Additionally we show in Fig. A1 the
results for the 90% cuts in all four systematic candidates.

When using only a subset S of the full data set, we expect the

e − ¯τe)2(cid:105) = (σS

(A1)

inferred value of ¯τe to change on average by
(cid:104)(∆¯τe)2(cid:105) = (cid:104)(¯τ S
¯τe )2 − (σ¯τe )2
due to purely statistical scatter, even if there is no effect of the given
systematic (e.g. Planck Collaboration 2015c). We show the results
for the change in our estimation of ¯τe in units of the expected mean
scatter in the right panel of Table A1. We ﬁnd that the results are
mostly consistent with purely statistical scatter. The only exception
is a weak trend of increasing ¯τe when cutting in seeing full width at

half maximum (FWHM): ¯τe changes by (cid:39)1.4×(cid:112)(cid:104)(∆¯τe)2(cid:105) when

using the 80% clusters with the best seeing. Nevertheless the result
for this particular cut is still consistent with the main result within
the measurement uncertainties. We further note that results from
different cuts in the same systematic candidate are correlated due
to the overlap in samples, so a weak ‘trend’ should not be over-
interpreted. Furthermore, if testing for several systematic candi-
dates one should not be surprised if one of them shows correlation

with the data at the ∼1σ level. We therefore conclude that at the
level of precision reported here, there is no signiﬁcant contamina-
tion by spatially varying observing conditions or extinction.
