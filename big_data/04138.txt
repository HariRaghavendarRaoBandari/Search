Abstract. The ratio of the Zeeman splitting to the cyclotron energy (M =
∆EZ /ωc), which characterizes the relative strength of the spin-orbit interaction in
crystals, is examined for the narrow gap IV-VI semiconductors PbTe, SnTe, and their
alloy Pb1−xSnxTe on the basis of the multiband k · p theory. The inverse mass α, the
g-factor g, and M are calculated numerically by employing the relativistic empirical
tight-binding band calculation. On the other hand, a simple but exact formula of M
is obtained for the six-band model based on the group theoretical analysis. It is shown
that M < 1 for PbTe and M > 1 for SnTe, which are interpreted in terms of the
relevance of the interband couplings due to the crystalline spin-orbit interaction. It
is clariﬁed both analytically and numerically that M = 1 just at the band inversion
point, where the transition from trivial to nontrivial topological crystalline insulator
occurs. By using this property, one can detect the transition point only with the bulk
measurements. It is also proposed that M is useful to evaluate quantitatively a degree
of the Dirac electrons in solids.

The spin-orbit interaction (SOI) aﬀects the eigenstate of electrons in solids in a
variety of ways.
It strongly depends on the crystal structure and the momentum of
the carrier. One of the most fundamental such eﬀects is the modiﬁcation of the band
structure. For example, in semiconductors of the diamond and zincblende structures,
the band modiﬁcation can be characterized by the spin-orbit splitting energy. But this
is not the whole information of the crystalline SOI. Another important information can
be obtained under a magnetic ﬁeld, where we cannot attain to only with the band
calculations. The one-body Hamiltonian under the magnetic ﬁeld can be separated into
two part in general: the symmetric and the antisymmetric part with respect to the
commutation of the kinematical momentum operator[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The eigenenergy
of the symmetric part is given in terms of the cyclotron energy as ωc(n + 1/2) with
an anisotropic cyclotron mass. The eigenenergy of the antisymmetric part is given
by the Zeeman energy with an anisotropic g-factor. This Zeeman energy does not
originate from the bare electron spins, but originates from the orbital motion of electrons.
The antisymmetric part is relevant only in the case with the sizable crystalline SOI.
Therefore, the eﬀect of the crystalline SOI is clearly reﬂected by the antisymmetric
part, whose relative strength is characterized by the ratio of the Zeeman splitting to

the cyclotron energy, M = ∆EZ/ωc. What is important here is that the ratio M is an
intrinsic value, which is not aﬀected by impurities or vacancies, and it can be accurately
determined by the quantum oscillation measurements.

So far, the ratio M has been determined repeatedly by experiments in strongly
spin-orbit coupled materials, such as Bi[6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and Bi2Se3[11, 12, 13]. On the
other hand, however, the clear theoretical understandings of M has been pushed aside
except for the two-band Dirac electron systems[3, 14, 5]. Actually, the anisotropic and
large M in Bi has been a puzzle for more than half a century[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Very recently,
this long-standing puzzle was eventually solved based on the multiband k· p theory[15].
It was newly clariﬁed that the ratio M contains the information of the interband eﬀects
due to the crystalline SOI. The formula of the ratio M given there is so general that it
is applicable for various systems where the SOI plays an important role. Therefore, we
can henceforth obtain new and rich informations of the crystalline SOI by measuring
the ratio M in various systems.

As another strongly spin-orbit coupled systems, the family of narrow-gap IV-VI
semiconductors with rock-salt structure, such as PbTe, SnTe, GeTe, PbSe and SnSe,

is of prime importance well recognized in the ﬁeld of thermoelectronics[17] but newly
interested in spin-orbit physics. Their alloy Pb1−xSnxTe is the ﬁrst known band inverted
materials[18, 19, 16](Fig. 1). The band inversion occurs since the ways of the band
modiﬁcation due to SOI are diﬀerent between PbTe and SnTe.
Interestingly, the
system turns from trivial to nontrivial topological crystalline insulators at this band
inversion[20, 21]. Such a band inversion can aﬀect the ratio M through the interband
eﬀect of SOI, which has never been recognized in other strongly spin-orbit coupled
systems.

In this paper, we report for the ﬁrst time the intimate properties of the ratio M in
the band inverted system of Pb1−xSnxTe based on the multiband k · p theory with the
relativistic empirical tight-binding band calculation. We show how the ratio M changes
by the band inversion. The obtained results establish the validity of the universal
understandings obtained in Ref. [15]. As a by-product, it reveals that M is useful not
only to obtain the information of the crystalline SOI eﬀect, but also to detect the band
inversion point only by the bulk measurement of quantum oscillations. Furthermore, M
can be also used to evaluate quantitatively the “Diracness” of the materials.

the velocity operator between the 0-th and n-th band for the same (opposite) spins as
tn = hψ0↑|v|ψn↑i (un = hψ0↑|v|ψn↓i). Equations (1)-(3) are general formulas to be valid
for various materials. For the rocksalt structure of Pb1−xSnxTe, we take the longitudinal
axis (z) parallel to (111)-direction and the transverse axis (x and y) perpendicular to
it. The ratios are then given by

where Mk and M⊥ are for the magnetic ﬁeld along the longitudinal and transverse

For two-band Hamiltonian only with E0 and E1, which is equivalent to the Dirac
Hamiltonian, Eqs.
(1)-(3) yields Mk = M⊥ = 1, the common result of the two-
band model[3, 14, 5]. If we further take into account the contributions form the other
band (i.e, more than three-band model), it was shown that the interband contributions
from the higher (lower) energy bands decrease (increase) the ratio M from unity for

valence band[15]. Based on this, we can immediately speculate the behaviors of M for
Pb1−xSnxTe without any speciﬁc calculations; this is a merit of the multiband k · p
theory. For PbTe, the top valence band of even parity (L+
6 ) has ﬁnite matrix elements
only between odd parity bands (L−
45), all of which locate above the valence band,
so that M should be less than unity. (The symmetry of each band at the L point are
shown in Fig. 1 (c).) For SnTe, on the other hand, the top valence band has odd parity
(L−
45). Then, the contribution from
the lower energy bands become relevant resulting in M larger than unity. It is naively
expected that M keeps unity for ﬁnite region in x, where the two band approximation
is valid, but no one has examined both theoretically and experimentally.

i.e., 18 band model.

First, we see the properties of M calculated by the numerical band calculations.
[16].
Here we adopt the relativistic empirical tight-binding model by Lent et al.
s-, p-, and d-orbitals are taken as the basis,
(The number
of the eigenenergy is 36 including the spin.) The band structures for PbTe and
SnTe so obtained are shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b).
In order to obtain the band
structure of Pb1−xSnxTe alloy, we employ the virtual crystal approximation, which
demonstrates correctly the band inversion between conduction and valence bands[16].
The energy levels at the L point are shown in Fig. 1 (c) as a function of the alloy
composition x. The band inversion occurs at x = 0.381, which quantitatively agrees
with the experimental observation[18]. The matrix elements tn and un are calculated
for six bands [L+
2)] from the tight binding
Hamiltonian. Then, M is calculated just by substituting tn, un, and En into Eqs. (1)-
(3). Hereafter we focus on the properties of the top valence band assuming the p-type
carries. Almost the same properties was obtained for the bottom conduction band.

The resultant α, g, and M are shown as a function of the Sn content x in Fig. 2.
The results: αk = −3.40, α⊥ = −40.4, gk = 65.7, and g⊥ = 19.1 are in good agreement
with the experimental values for PbTe[22, 23]. There are four signiﬁcant features of M:
(i) Mk,⊥ < 1 for PbTe and Mk,⊥ > 1 for SnTe; (ii) Mk,⊥ = 1 just at the band inversion
point; (iii) M is very isotropic for PbTe side while it is anisotropic for SnTe side, and
(iv) M⊥ diverges in the SnTe side. The property (i) is consistent with the anticipation
above, whereas properties (ii)-(iv) are the results that are ﬁrstly revealed by the present
calculation. These properties can be clearly interpreted based on the group theoretical
analysis in the following.

For PbTe, the matrix elements with the L+

where ∆n = E0 − En and ∆3 < ∆2 < ∆1 < 0 for PbTe. Here, although we take into
account whole six bands originating from the p-orbitals, only the contributions from
the four bands (E0∼3) are ﬁnite. We obtain Mk = M⊥ = 1 if we take into account the
contributions only from E0 and E1.

(i) The contributions from the higher energy bands, En≥2, lowers both Mk and M⊥.
For example, with the three-band model (taking into account E0, E1, and E2 bands),
we obtain very simple but exact formulas as

M⊥ =

(10)
where X = √2c/a and λ = ∆1/∆2 is a positive small value for PbTe. These results
show that both Mk and M⊥ decrease from unity due to the third band (E2) contribution.
For SnTe, the analytic forms for αij, Gii, and M are the same as Eqs. (5)-(8) except
for the diﬀerent values of a ∼ e. In the SnTe case, however, ∆1 < 0 < ∆2 < ∆3 due to
the band inversion, so that λ becomes negative resulting in the increase of M. These
results verify the general understandings of M[15] in a clearer manner.

(ii) Furthermore, Eqs.

(9) and (10) give an exact proof of another important
property of M — both Mk and M⊥ cross unity just at the band inversion point (λ = 0).
This is rather surprising since it is naively believed so far that M = 1 (or the nontrivial
Berry’s phase[25, 26, 27]) is something “quantized” value and so it should hold for a ﬁnite
range where the band gap is small and the two-band approximation is valid. However,
Eqs. (9) and (10) prove that M is a continuous value and not quantized for the actual
materials, where there are always small but ﬁnite contributions from the other bands.
M = 1 is true only when the band gap ∆1 is zero.

(iii) Figure 3 shows the Sn content dependence of αk/α⊥, gk/g⊥, and Mk/M⊥, which
represents their anisotropy. It is clearly seen from Fig. 3 that M in the PbTe side is very
isotropic, while it is highly anisotropic in the SnTe side. From the three-band analysis
of Eqs. (9) and (10), the anisotropy of M is

Mk
M⊥

=

1 − λ|X|2

p1 + λ|X|2 ≃ 1 −

λ|X|2.

(11)

The anisotropy Mk/M⊥ should deviate from unity away from the band inversion point,
which is incompatible with the numerical result. If we further take into account the
whole six bands, we obtain in the exact forms as

Mk =

M⊥ =

1 − λ|X|2 + λ′|Y |2
1 + λ|X|2 + λ′|Y |2 ,
p(1 + λ′|Z|2)(1 + λ|X|2 + λ′|Y |2)

(12)

(13)

where Y = e/a, Z = d∗/b∗, and λ′ = ∆1/∆3. For small λ- and λ′-terms, the anisotropy
of M can be written up to the six-band model as

Mk
M⊥ ≃ 1 −

λ′|Y + Z|2.

(14)

Hence, the contributions from E3 can compensate with that from E2, so that M of PbTe
should be considerably isotropic, though the surprisingly isotropic M of the present
result will be due to an accidentally perfect compensation. Actually, if we calculate M
from other tight-binding model by Lach-hab et al.[28], we obtained Mk/M⊥ = 0.909;
still isotropic, but not so perfectly. (Note that the expansion of Eq. (14) is valid for
PbTe side, but invalid for SnTe side, where M⊥ diverges. )

(iv) Equations (12) and (13) also prove that Mk,⊥ can diverge at some point of
λ, λ′ < 0, i.e., in the SnTe side and never diverge in the PbTe side. There are two
possibilities: (1) both Mk and M⊥ diverge due to 1 + λ|X|2 + λ′|Y |2 → 0; (2) only
M⊥ diverges due to 1 + λ′|Z|2 → 0. In the present calculation, only M⊥ diverges at
x = 0.938, which means 1 + λ′|Z|2 diverges (i.e., αzz → 0). By analyzing the properties
of both Mk and M⊥, we can obtain the detailed informations of the interband matrix
elements due to the crystalline SOI.

One of the most useful and practical aspects of the ratio M is to be able to compare
diﬀerent materials through the common index M. It is worth noting that, for the holes
at T point in Bi, M ∼ 2 for one direction of the magnetic ﬁeld, and M = 0 for the
perpendicular direction[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15]. These properties are very diﬀerent from the
isotropic M ∼ 1 in PbTe, although the T point of rhombohedral Bi has the equivalent
symmetries to the L point of rocksalt PbTe[24]. This diﬀerence can be interpreted as
the diﬀerence of the order of the band: the hole band of Bi has the T −
45 symmetry,
which is equivalent to L−
6 . Only this diﬀerence causes
the signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the property of M. In other words, M is very sensitive to
the symmetry of the band and the interband matrix elements that is crucial for the
crystalline SOI.

45, whereas that of PbTe has the L+

The initial purpose of the present work was to study the ratio M for the speciﬁc
model of Pb1−xSnxTe alloys and enrich the understanding of the general properties of M.
The present results, however, give rise to byproducts. First, by using the property (ii),
we can detect the exact point of the band inversion through the “bulk” measurement
of M, such as the quantum oscillation measurements. This means the bulk detection of
the transition from the trivial to the non-trivial topological crystalline insulator[20, 21].
This approach will be a complement to the optical spectroscopy measurements.

Second, we can quantitatively evaluate the “Diracness” in terms of M. Nowadays
various type of materials have been recognized as the Dirac electron systems, whose
eﬀective Hamiltonian is given by the Dirac Hamiltonian, e.g., Bi[14, 5], PbTe,
Ca3PbO[29] etc. Naively, when the band dispersion of the candidate material looks
like Dirac dispersion, one may call it Dirac electron systems. But the judgment of this
kind is too sensual. If one uses M as the indicator of the Dirac electrons, one can make
a quantitative comparison of the Diracness between diﬀerent materials. For example,
M = 1.00-1.02 for electron carrier in Bi with the ﬁeld along the bisectrix axis[10], while
M = 0.834 for PbTe.

In summary, we studied the ratio of the Zeeman splitting to the cyclotron energy,
M = ∆EZ/ωc, for Pb1−xSnxTe based on the multiband k · p theory. By employing
the tight-binding band calculation, We calculated α, g, and M numerically. Based on
the group theoretical analysis, we obtained the simple but exact formulas of M, (12)
and (13), which deepen the understandings of M. We certiﬁed that M < 1 for PbTe
and M > 1 for SnTe. It is rather surprising that the band 2 eV far from the Fermi
energy gives a sizable contribution to M; a strong indication of the large interband
coupling due to the crystalline SOI. We found that M crosses unity just at the band
inversion point. By using this property, we can detect the transition to the topological
crystalline insulator only from the bulk measurement of quantum oscillation. We can
obtain detailed informations of the interband matrix elements due to the crystalline
SOI by analyzing both Mk and M⊥. Also, M can be used as a good indicator that can
quantitatively evaluate how the electrons in crystal is close to the Dirac electrons.
