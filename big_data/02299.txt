Quantitative h-principle for isotropic embeddings and

applications in C0-symplectic geometry

Lev Buhovsky1 and Emmanuel Opshtein, with an appendix by Jaime Bustillo

March 9, 2016

Abstract

We proceed here with the investigation of so-called quantitative h-principle state-
ments in symplectic geometry and their consequences in C 0-symplectic geometry, as
initiated in [BO14]. We prove a non-squeezing statement for the reduction of symplec-
tic homeomorphisms which preserve a co-isotropic submanifold. We also prove ﬂexibility
of isotropic discs in dimension 6. The main tool is a quantitative h-principle statement
for subcritical isotropic submanifolds.

Introduction

Gromov’s h-principle lies at the core of symplectic topology, by bringing many questions of
existence of embeddings or immersions to the ﬁeld of algebraic topology. Symplectic topol-
ogy therefore generally focuses on the other problems, that do not abide by an h-principle :
Lagrangian embeddings, existence of symplectic hypersurfaces in speciﬁc homology classes,
. . . Recently, we established that a reﬁned version of h-principle, which we call quantitative
h-principle, is suitable for the purposes of understanding C0-symplectic geometry. For in-
stance, we proved in [BO14] that C0-close symplectic 2-discs of the same area are isotopic
by a small symplectic isotopy in dimension at least 6, while it does not hold in dimen-
sion 4. Rigidity/ﬂexibility statements in C0-symplectic geometry follow. Let us say that
a map f : (M, ω) → (M ′, ω′) satisﬁes the non-squeezing property if for all symplectic ball
B2n(a) ⊂ M (of capacity a), the image f (B(a)) ⊂ M ′ can be embedded into a cylinder
Z(A) := D(A) × C2n−2 only if A > a. The main results from [BO14] can be summarized as
follows:

Theorem. If a symplectic homeomorphism preserves a symplectic submanifold Q ⊂ M , its
restriction to Q satisﬁes the non-squeezing property if Q has codimension 2, while it can
arbitrarily contract the symplectic form in higher codimension. If, instead of preserving a
symplectic submanifold, it preserves a hypersurface, it also preserves its characteristic folia-
tion [Ops09, HLS15], and the map it induces at the level of the reduction of the hypersurface
satisﬁes the non-squeezing property.

The object of this note is to go further in the understanding of symplectic homeomor-
phisms. Our main technical result is a quantitative h-principle statement for subcritical
isotropic embeddings in a symplectic manifold.

Theorem 1 (Quantitative h-principle for subcritical isotropic embeddings). Let V be an
open subset of Cn, k < n, u0, u1 : Dk ֒→ V be isotropic embeddings of discs. We assume
that there exists a homotopy F : Dk × [0, 1] → V between u0 and u1 (so F (·, 0) = u0,
F (·, 1) = u1) of size less than ε (Diam F ({z} × [0, 1]) < ε for all z ∈ Dk).

Then there exists a Hamiltonian isotopy (Ψt)t∈[0,1] such that Ψ1 ◦ u0 = u1, of size less

than Cε for a constant C that depends only on k (in particular, dC0(Ψ1, Id ) < Cε).

We show here that C < 4k2

, but a much better estimate is certainly true. The proof
moreover shows that the theorem holds in the relative case, provided u0, u1 are symplec-
tically isotopic, relative to the boundary. The method of the proof of theorem 1 follows a
very similar track as the quantitative h-principle for symplectic discs that we established in
[BO14]. Paralleling the construction of a symplectic homeomorphism whose restriction to a
symplectic disc is a contraction in dimension 6, we can deduce from theorem 1 the following
statement:

Theorem 2. There exists a symplectic homeomorphism with compact support in C3 which
takes a symplectic disc to an isotropic one.

Of course, by considering products, we infer that there exists symplectic homeomor-
phisms that take some codimension 4 symplectic submanifolds to submanifolds which are
nowhere symplectic.

As hinted in the ﬁrst version of [BO14], theorem 1 implies a rigidity statement for the
action of symplectic homeomorphisms on coisotropic submanifolds. Recall that if a symplec-
tic homeomorphism f takes a smooth coisotropic submanifold N to a smooth submanifold
N ′, then N ′ is also coisotropic, and f conjugates the characteristic foliations of N and N ′
[HLS15]. It therefore descends at the level of the reductions to a map ˆf : ˆN → ˆN ′.
It
was proven in [BO14] that when N is a hypersurface, ˆf abides by the non-squeezing prop-
erty. We use here quantitative h-principle for isotropic discs to prove a similar result in full
generality (see also [HLS14] for a related result).

Theorem 3. Let h be a symplectic homeomorphism which sends a co-isotropic submanifold
N to a smooth submanifold N ′, and ˆh : ˆN → ˆN ′ its action at the level of the reduc-
tion. Then, ˆf veriﬁes the polydisc non-squeezing property: if P (a) = D(a)k ∈ Red N , and
h(P (a))

ω
֒→ Z 2k(A), then A ≥ a.

Of course, since P (a) contains a ball of capacity a, this polydisc non-squeezing is slightly
weaker than the usual non-squeezing property. However, it is still very related to the
symplectic structure: a smooth map which veriﬁes this polydisc non-squeezing is symplectic.

The note is organized as follows. We prove theorem 1 in the next section. The construc-
tion of a symplectic homeomorphism that takes a symplectic disc to an isotropic one is

2

explained in section 3, where we also explain a relation to relative Eliashberg-Gromov type
questions, as posed in [BO14]. We then prove theorem 3 in section 4, modulo a Lagrangian
Camel statement (theorem 4.2), in the spirit of [Th´e99b]. We prove this theorem in section
5 via Eliashberg’s theory of ﬁlling with holomorphic discs. In appendix B, J. Bustillo gives
an independent proof of the same result, via Viterbo’s theory of generating functions.

Conventions and Notations We convene the following in the course of this paper:

• All our homotopies and isotopies have parameter space [0, 1]. For instance (gt) denotes

an isotopy (gt)t∈[0,1].

• Similarly, by concatenation of homotopies we always mean reparametrized concatena-

tion.

• If F : [0, 1] × X → Y is a homotopy with value in a metric space, Size (F ) :=

sup{Diam(cid:0)F ([0, 1] × {x})(cid:1), x ∈ X}.

• For A ⊂ B, Op (A, B) stands for an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of A in B. To

keep light notation, we omit B whenever there is no possible ambiguity.

2 Quantitative h-principle for isotropic discs

The aim of this section is to prove theorem 1, or rather the following slighlty stronger result,
which will be useful for theorem 3:

Theorem 2.1. Let V be an open subset of Cn, k < n, l = n − k, u0, u1 : Dk × [−1, 1]l ֒→ V
be two isotropic embeddings of discs. Call bs u0, bs u1 the restriction of these embeddings to
Dk × {0}. We assume that there exists a homotopy F : Dk × [0, 1] → V between bs u0, bs u1
of size less than ε.

Then there exists a Hamiltonian isotopy (Ψt)t∈[0,1] such that Ψ1 ◦ u0 = u1 on Dk ×

Op Rl(0), of size Cε, where C depends only on k.

2.1 Standard h-principle for subcritical isotropic embeddings

We recall in this section the main properties of the action of the Hamiltonian group on
isotropic embeddings, as described in [Gro86, EM02]. To this purpose, we ﬁrst ﬁx some
notations. In all this paper, the discs Dk will always be closed, unless explicitely stated
(hence an embedding of D inside an open set is always compactly embedded). Since we
only deal with isotropic embeddings, the reader can consider that Dk stands for the k-
dimensional ball (of any size), or for [−1, 1]k. The set of isotropic framings Giso(k, n) is
the space of (k, 2n)-matrices of rank k whose columns span an isotropic vector space in
(R2n, ωst).

Fix an open subset V ⊂ R2n, l1, l2 ∈ N, l1 + l2 ≤ n, l1 < n. For an isotropic embedding
u : Dl1 × [−1, 1]l2 ֒→ V , denote by bs u : Dl1 ֒→ V the restriction of u to Dl1 × {0} (we
think at these embeddings as framed isotropic embeddings of Dl1). For two such isotropic
embeddings u0, u1 which coincide on Op (∂Dl1) × [−1, 1]l2 , we construct a continuous map
γ01 : Sl1 → Giso(l1 + l2, n) in the following way. Consider a covering of Sl1 by two embedded
discs ϕ0, ϕ1 : D

l1 → Sl1, with ϕ0|∂D = ϕ1|∂D, and deﬁne

γ01

0(ϕ−1
1(ϕ−1

0 (x), 0) if x ∈ ϕ0(Dl1)
1 (x), 0) if x ∈ ϕ1(Dl1)

.

We will call this map by γ(u0, u1) when the precision is needed. The homotopy class of this
map is an element [γ01] ∈ πl1(Giso(l1 + l2, n)), which is clearly trivial when u0 and u1 are
homotopic through isotropic embeddings.

Theorem 2.2 (Parametric C0-dense relative h-principle for isotropic embeddings [EM02,
Theorem 12.4.1]). Recall that l1 < n, l1 + l2 ≤ n, and V ⊂ R2n is an open subset.

(i) Let u0 : Dl1 × [−1, 1]l2 ֒→ V be an isotropic embedding, and a ∈ πl1(Giso(l1 + l2, n)).
There exists another isotropic embedding u1 : Dl1 × [−1, 1]l2 ֒→ V , which coincides
with u0 on Op (∂Dl1) × [−1, 1]l2 , and such that [γ01] = a.

(ii) Let u0, u1 : Dl1 × [−1, 1]l2

֒→ V be two isotropic embeddings which coincide on
Op (∂Dl1) × [−1, 1]l2 . Assume that u0, u1 are homotopic in V , relative to Op (∂Dl1) ×
[−1, 1]l2 , and that [γ01] = 1 ∈ πl1(Giso(l1 + l2, n)). Then there exists a smooth ho-
motopy (ut) of isotropic embeddings between u0, u1, relative to Op (∂Dl1) × [−1, 1]l2 .
Moreover, if it is any homotopy between bs (u0), bs (u1) relative to Op (∂Dl1), and

δ > 0, the isotopy ut can be chosen so that dC0(cid:0)bs (ut), it(cid:1) < δ.

Recall that any smooth isotropic homotopy ut : Dl1 × [−1, 1]l2 ֒→ V is of the form
H ◦ u0, where H : V × [0, 1] → R is a smooth function with compact support in V . We

Proposition 2.3. Let V ⊂ R2n be an open bounded subset, u0, u1 :

4

Op (∂Dl1 ) × [−1, 1]l2 in V , and [γ01] = 1. If l1 = 1, we further assume that for a 1-form λ

Then there exists a Hamiltonian isotopy (ψt) with compact support in V , such that ψ1 ◦u0 =
u1.

We will also need the following lemma, which allows to achieve general positions by

Hamiltonian perturbations.

Lemma 2.4. Let V ⊂ Cn be an open set, Σ1, Σ2 be two submanifolds of V , which are
transverse in a neighbourhood of ∂V . Then there exists a small Hamiltonian perturbation
ϕ with compact support in V , such that ϕ(Σ1) ⋔ Σ2.

Finally, we need the following consequence of theorem 2.2.

Corollary 2.5. Let u0 : Dl1−1 × [−1, 1] × [−1, 1]l2 ֒→ V ⊂ Cl1+l2 × Cn−l1−l2 be the standard
isotropic inclusion, a ∈ πl1(Giso(l1 + l2, n)), 0 < δ ≪ 1. There exists an isotropic embedding
ua : Dl1−1 × [−1, 1] × [−1, 1]l2 ֒→ V such that :

(i) The embeddings ua, u0 coincide except on B(0, δ) × [−1, 1]l2 , and they coincide as well

on a neighbourhood of Dl1−1 × {0} × [−1, 1]l2 ,

(ii) Denoting by uℓ

a their restrictions to Dl1−1 × [0, 1]× [−1, 1]l2 ), we have [γℓ

(iii) u0 and ua are homotopic relative to Op(cid:0)∂(Dl1−1×[−1, 1])(cid:1)×[−1, 1]l2 via isotropic em-

beddings. Moreover, there exists a Hamiltonian isotopy (ϕt) with support in B(0, δ) ⊂
Cn, such that ϕ1 ◦ u0|Op (Dl1−1×[−1,1]×{0}) = u1.

Proof: Let Dℓ, Dr ⊂ Dl1−1 × [−1, 1] be the discs of size δ/4, centered at (0, −δ/2), (0, δ/2)
respectively. If ν is small enough, u0(Dℓ × [−ν, ν]l2) ⊂ Bℓ
theorem 2.2 (i), there exists an isotropic embedding ˜uℓ : Dℓ × [−ν, ν]l2 ֒→ Bℓ
δ, such that
˜uℓ|Op (∂Dℓ)×[−ν,ν]l2 = u0, and γ0ℓ = a. Moreover, by lemma 2.4, we can assume that Im ˜uℓ
does not meet Im u0 away from Op (∂Dℓ)×[−ν, ν]l2. Extending ˜uℓ by u0 on Dl1−1 ×[−1, 0]×
[−ν, ν]l2, we therefore get an isotropic embedding uℓ : Dl1−1 × [−1, 0] × [−ν, ν]l2 ֒→ V , with
[γ0ℓ] = a, which coincides with u0 outside Dℓ × [−ν, ν]l2, and such that uℓ(Dℓ × [−ν, ν]l2) ⊂
δ. Proceed similarly to get ur : Dl1−1 × [0, 1] × [−1, 1]l2 with the same property, except
Bℓ
that [γ0r] = a−1, and deﬁne

δ := B(cid:0)(0, −δ/2), δ/3(cid:1) ⊂ Cn. By

.

This is an isotropic embedding which obviously veriﬁes (i) and (ii). Moreover, u0 and ua
coincide outside B(0, 5δ/6) × [−ν, ν]l2, verify u0, ua(B(0, 5δ/6) × [−ν, ν]l2) ⊂ B(0, δ) ⊂ Cn,
and [γ0a] = [γ0ℓ] · [γ0r] = 1. The point (iii) therefore holds by theorem 2.2 (ii).

2.2 Proof of theorem 2.1

Let k < n, Dk := [0, 1]k, Dk(µ) := [−µ, 1 + µ]k, u0, u1 : Dk × [−1, 1]n−k ֒→ V ⊂ Cn
be smooth lagrangian embeddings, and F : Dk × [0, 1] → V a smooth homotopy between
bs (u0), bs (u1) with Size F < ε. We need to prove that there exists a Hamiltonian isotopy
of size Cε, which takes u0 to u1 on Op (Dk × {0}, Dk × [−1, 1]n−k), for some constant C
that depends only on k. To avoid heavy notation, for any subset A ⊂ Dk, by Op (A) we
mean Op (A × {0}, Dk × [−1, 1]n−k) throughout this section.

Before getting to the proof, we need to modify slightly the framework. First, extend
the isotropic embeddings and the homotopy to slightly larger discs: u0, u1 : Dk(µ) ×
[−1, 1]n−k ֒→ V , F : Dk(µ) × [0, 1] → V . By lemma 2.4, we do not lose generality if
we assume that the images of u0, u1 are disjoint (since k < n), which we do henceforth.
Next, the homotopy F can turned into a more convenient object:

Lemma 2.6 (see [BO14, lemma A.1]). There exists an embedding ˜F : Dk(µ) × [0, 1] ֒→ V ,
with ˜F (x, 0) = u0(x), ˜F (x, 1) = u1(x), with Diam ( ˜F ({x} × [0, 1])) < 2ε for all x ∈ Dk(µ).
In other words, ˜F has size 2ε when considered as a homotopy between u0, u1.

Now ˜F can be further extended to an embedding, still denoted ˜F ,

˜F : Dk(µ) × [−µ, µ]2n−k−1 ֒→ V.

Consider now a regular grid of Dk(µ), of step ν = 1/K, K ∈ N, K ≫ 1 (to be speciﬁed

later):

Γ := νZk ∩ Dk

Γ′ := νZk ∩ Dk(µ).

This grid generates a cellular decomposition of Dk, whose l-skeleton Γl is the union of
the l-faces. The set of k-faces has a natural integer-valued distance, given by the minimal
number of k − 1-cell one has to cross to go from one such face to another one. If x is a
k-face of Γ, we denote by Ux the η-neighbourhood of x in Dk (η ≪ ν will be chosen later),
Wx := ˜F (Ux × [−η, 1 + η] × [−η, η]2n−k−1), and W (n)(x) := ∪W (x′), where the union is over
all the k-faces x′ of γ at distance at most n from x.

We will prove theorem 1 by successively isotopying the l-skeleton with a control on the

size of each isotopy. Precisely, arguing by induction on l, we prove the following:

Proposition 2.7. There exists Hamiltonian isotopies (Ψt
and modiﬁed embeddings v0 := Ψ1

0 ◦ u0, vl := Ψ1

l ◦ vl−1, such that

l), l ∈ [0, k] with support in V ,

(I1) vl ≡ u1 on a neighbourhood of the l-skeleton Γl,

(I2) vl(xk) ⊂ W 2l(xk) for each k-face xk ⊂ Γk and each l ∈ [0, k − 1],

(I3) Size (Ψt

l) < 2ε for all l ∈ [0, k − 1], Size (Ψt

k) < 2(2k + 1)kε,

(I4) vl(

◦
xl+1) ∩ u1(

◦
x′
l+1) = ∅ for all pair of distinct l + 1-faces of Γ, ∀l ∈ [0, k − 1].

6

Remark 2.8. Notice that (I2) implies the same control for vl(Op (xk)). Similarly, coupling
◦
x′
l+1 ×[−εl, εl]n−l) = ∅ for some εl > 0.
(I1) and (I4), we get that vl(

◦
xl+1 ×[−εl, εl]n−l)∩u1(

Of course, this proposition proves theorem 1 because concatenation Ψ := (Ψt

k)∗· · ·∗(Ψt
0)
deﬁnes a Hamiltonian isotopy with support in V , of size at most 4k2
ε (in fact much less if we
analyze the proof carefully, but we do not need it here), such that Ψ1◦u0 = vk = u1 on Dk.(cid:3)

Proof of proposition 2.7: As already explained, the proof goes by induction over the dimen-
sion of the skeleton Γl. Recall that W (x) is a neighbourhood (whose width is controlled by
η), of the trajectory of a k-face x of Γ under the isotopy ˜F . Since Size ( ˜F ) < 2ε, if the size
ν of the k-face and the width η of the neighbourhood are small enough, we have

Diam W 2k

(x) < 2ε for all k-face x of Γ.

(2.2.1)

We assume henceforth that this requirement on (ν, η) is met.

The 0-skeleton: Let x be a 0-face of Γ, ρ < η, and Dρ(x) the ρ-neighbourhood of x in
Dk(µ) × [−1, 1]n−k. Then u0(Dρ(x)), u1(Dρ(x)) both lie in Wx, and ˜F provides an isotopy
between u0|Dρ(x) and u1|Dρ(x) in Wx. There therefore exists a Hamiltonian isotopy (ψt
x) with
support in Wx, such that ψ1
x ◦ u0 = u1 on Dρ(x). Since Wx ∩ Wx′ = ∅ for diﬀerent 0-faces
x, x′, the isotopies ψx have pairwise disjoint supports.

0(x1) ⊂ Wxk .

The isotopy ψt

0) along at most one (ψt

0 := ◦ψt
x, where the composition runs over all 0-faces x of Γ, veriﬁes (I1)
It satisﬁes (I2) because if xk is a k-face of Γ, a point p ∈ xk veriﬁes
by construction.
0(p) 6= p only if p ∈ Ux0 for a 0-face x0 of Γ with x0 ⊂ ∂xk, and then ψ1
ψ1
0(p) ∈ Wx0 ⊂ Wxk ,
so ψ1
It satisﬁes (I3) for the same reason: a point p ∈ V is moved under
(ψt
x), which has support in Wx, and Wx has diameter less than
2ε. Finally, ψ1
0 ◦ u0 might not verify (I4). However, since ψ0 ◦ u0 coincides with u1 on a
neighbourhood of Γ0, there exist balls B(u1(x0), r) for each 0-face x0 of Γ, such that (I4) is
0 ◦ u0(x1) and u1(x′
veriﬁed inside these balls. Therefore the traces of the submanifolds ψ1

inside V \ ∪
1. Thus,
there is a C1-small Hamiltonian perturbation ( ˜ψt) with support in V \ ∪ B(u1(x), r/2), such
that ˜ψ1 ◦ ψ1
1 of diﬀerent 1-faces of Γ (hence these
0) veriﬁes (I1),(I4) by construction of ˜ψt,
intersections are empty). Now Ψt
and still veriﬁes (I2),(I3) provided that ˜ψt is C0-small enough.

0 := ( ˜ψt) ∗ (ψt

The l-skeleton (l < k or k < n − 1): We now assume that Ψ1, . . . , Ψl−1 have been
constructed, and we proceed to the induction step. Recall that vl−1 = Ψ1
0 ◦ u0
coincides with u1 on Op (Γl−1), and that vl−1(Op (xk)) ⊂ W 2l−1
(xk) for all k-face xk of Γ.
Our aim is now to ﬁnd a Hamiltonian isotopy Ψl such that Ψ1
l ◦ vl−1|Op (xl) = u1|Op (xl) for
all l-face xl of Γ.

l−1 ◦ · · · ◦ Ψ1

For each l-face xl of Γ, parametrize a small neighbourhood of xl in Dk(µ)×[−1, 1]n−k by
xl×[−ζ, ζ]n−l. Then, vl−1|Op (xl) and u1|Op (xl) are two isotropic embeddings of xl×[−ζ, ζ]k−l,
which coincide on Op (∂xl). Consider the corresponding element

a(xl) := [γ(u1|Op (xl), vl−1|Op (xl))] ∈ πl(Giso(n, n)).

7

Step I: killing the formal obstructions. As explained in the previous section, those elements
a(xl) which do not vanish prevent us from ﬁnding a relative isotopy ψt
xl that would bring
vl−1 to u1 on a neighbourhood of xl. Before isotopying the l-skeleton, we therefore per-
form a small Hamiltonian perturbation, not relative to Op (Γl−1), which removes all these
obstructions.

Step III: Isotopying the l-skeleton. Fix an l-face xl of Γ. By (i), there exists a compact

l−1(Op (ˆxl)) both lie in the topological balls W 2l−1

there exists a homotopy

(xl)

such that σxl(·, 0) = v′
l−1, σxl(·, 1) = u1 and σxl(x, t) = u1(x) ∀x ∈ Op (∂ ˆxl). Since ˆxl ⋐ xl
and l < k < n, (iv) allows to use a general position argument to ensure moreover that
the diﬀerent sets Im σxl, where xl runs over the l-faces of Γ, are pairwise disjoint (this
is the only point in the proof where we need that l < k, or k < n − 1). Consider now
regular neighbourhoods Vxl of Im σxl, which are disjoint. By construction, v′
l−1|Op (ˆxl) is
homotopic to u1|Op (ˆxl) in Vxl, relative to Op (∂ ˆxl), on Vxl, by (ii), [γ(v′

ˆvl|Op (xl) = u1|Op (xl) for all l-face xl of Γ. Hence ˆvl and u1 coincide on a neighbourhood of

along at most one of the (ψt

3 Action of symplectic homeomorphisms on symplectic sub-

manifolds

3.1 Taking a symplectic disc to an isotropic one

We aim now at proving theorem 2. Although it is completely similar to the proof of the
ﬂexibility of the disc area provided in [BO14] once theorem 1 is established, we rewrite
below the argument in our situation for the convenience of the reader. Recall that theorem
1 holds for symplectic embeddings of discs in C3 [BO14, Theorem 2].

Theorem 3.1. Theorem 1 holds when the isotropic embeddings u0, u1 are replaced by sym-
plectic embeddings u0, u1 : D ֒→ W such that u∗

0ω = ωst.

1ω = u∗

10

Proof of theorem 2: Let

i0

: D

(x, y)

−→ C × C × C = C3,
7−→ (x, y, 0)

u0

: D −→ C × C × C

z

7−→ (z, 0, 0)

be the standard isotropic and symplectic embeddings of D into C3. Let also fk : D(2) →
D1/2k be an area-preserving immersion and

uk

: D

(x, y)

−→ C × C × C
7−→ (x, y, fk(x + iy)).

Then, uk is a symplectic embedding of D into C3 with dC0(uk, i0) < 1
2k . Let ﬁnally consider
an isotropic embedding il
2l . Although less explicit than
the previous embedding in dimension 6, it certainly exists because one can approximate the
standard symplectic embedding u0 by isotropic ones of the form z 7→ (z, fl(z), 0). We also
deﬁne

k of D into C3 with dC0(il

k, uk) < 1

Wk(δ) := {z ∈ C3 | d(z, Im uk) < δ}
and W 0(δ) := {z ∈ C3 | d(z, Im i0) < δ}.

Since there exists a symplectic diﬀeomorphism ϕ0 with compact support in C3 with ϕ0◦u0 =
uk1 (k1 arbitrary), it is enough to construct a sequence ϕi such that ϕi ◦ uki = uki+1 with
ki+1 > ki, which converges C0 to a homeomorphism ϕ.

Choose a decreasing sequence of open sets U1 ⊃ U2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ uk1(D), with ∩Ui = uk1(D).
Choose l1 such that Im il1
⊂ U2 ∩ W 0(ε1) (ε1 := 1/2k1, so that Im uk1 ⊂ W 0(ε1)), δ1 =
k1
1/2l1 < ε1. Then dC0(il1
, i0) < 2ε1, so theorem 1 ensures that there exists a hamiltonian

where C is a universal constant.

Now, ψ′

1(Wk1(δ1)). Then, both ψ′

2k2 , W 0(ε2) ⊂ ψ′

1, Id ) < Cε1, dC0(ψ′

1 ◦ uk1, uk2) < dC0(ψ′

1 ◦ ψ′

1 ◦ ψ′

Thus ψ1 := ψ′′

1 is a Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism with support in W 0(ε1) ⊂ U1, such
that ψ1(U2) ⊃ W 0(ε2) ⊃ uk2(D), uk2 = ψ1 ◦ uk1, and dC0(ψ1, Id ) < C ′′ε1 (C ′′ := C + C ′ is
a universal constant, which will be refered to as C in the sequel).

The same induction as in [BO14, §2.1] yields a sequence of Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphisms

ψi with support in U1, such that:

(i) ψi has support in W 0(εi) ⊂ ϕi−1(Ui) where ϕi := ψi−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ψ1,

(ii) dC0(Id , ψi) < Cεi = C
2ki ,

(iii) uki+1 = ϕi ◦ uki.

It follows by (ii) that ϕi is a Cauchy sequence in the C0 topology, hence uniformly
converges to some continuous map ϕ : C3 → C3. Next, since uki+1 = ϕi ◦ uki for every

11

(x) 6= i0 ◦ u−1
k1

i > 1, we have i0 = ϕ ◦ uk1. Finally, we claim that ϕ is an injective map, hence a home-
omorphism. To see this, consider two points x 6= y ∈ U1. If x, y ∈ uk1(D), then by (iii),
ϕ(x) = i0 ◦ u−1
(y) = ϕ(y). If x, y /∈ uk1(D), then x, y ∈ cUi for i large enough,
k1
so by (i), ϕi(x) = ϕi+1(x) = ϕi+2(x) = ... = ϕ(x), and similarly ϕi(y) = ϕ(y) (because
the supports of ψi, ψi+1, . . . are contained in ϕi−1(Ui)), so ϕ(x) = ϕi(x) 6= ϕi(y) = ϕ(y).
Finally, if x ∈ uk1(D) and y /∈ uk1(D), y ∈ cUi for i large enough, so ϕ(y) = ϕi(y) ∈
ϕi(cUi) ⊂ ϕi(cUi+1) ⊂ cW 0(εi) by (i). Since ϕ(x) ∈ Im i0 ⊂ W 0(εi), we conclude that in
this case also ϕ(x) 6= ϕ(y).

3.2 Relative Eliashberg-Gromov C0-rigidity

In this paragraph, we deal with the following question:

Question 1. Assume that a symplectic homeomorphism h sends a smooth submanifold N
to a submanifold N ′ and that h|N is smooth. Under which condition h∗ω|N ′ = ω|N ?

Of course this question is non-trivial only when dim N is at least 2, which we assume
henceforth. In [BO14], we asked the question, answered it in several cases and conjecture
answers in other cases. Theorem 2 allows to prove all the conjectural statements of [BO14].
In order to state the result in the most clear way, we set the following convention. A sub-
manifold N ⊂ (M, ω) is called pre-symplectic if ω has constant rank on M . The symplectic
dimension of a pre-symplectic submanifold N is the minimal dimension of a symplectic sub-
manifold that contains N . One checks immediately that dimω N = dim N + Corank ω|N .

Theorem 4. Let N ⊂ (M, ω) be a pre-symplectic disc of arbitrary dimension, h : M → M ′
a symplectic homeomorphism which coincides with a diﬀeomorphism on N , and N ′ = h(N ).
Then the answer to question 1 is

• Negative If dimω N 6 2n − 4, or if dimω N = 2n − 2 and Corank ω|N > 2,

• Positive if dimω N = 2n, or if dimω N = 2n − 2 and Corank ω|N = 0.

We do not know the answer of this question when dimω N = 2n − 2 and Corank ω|N = 1
(i.e. dim N = 2n − 3, Corank ω|N = 1).

Proof: When dimω N ≤ 2n − 4 and N is not isotropic, the answer is negative because we
can ﬁnd a symplectic homeomorphism that ﬁxes N and contracts the symplectic form (by
[BO14]). When dimω N 6 2n − 2 and r := corankω|N > 2, there is a local symplectomor-
phism that takes N to [0, 1]r × Dk × {0} ⊂ Cr
(w), where m ≥ 1 and r ≥ 2. By
theorem 2, we can ﬁnd a symplectic homeomorphism f (z1, z2, w1) of C2 × C which takes
[0, 1]2 × {0} to a symplectic disc. The induced map

(z′) × Cm

(z) × Ck

is obviously a symplectic homeomorphism which takes N to a submanifold on which the
co-rank of the symplectic form is reduced by 2. Note that this argument also works when
dimω N ≤ 2n − 4 and N is isotropic. The second item of the proposition was proved in
[BO14].
(cid:3)

4 The action of a symplectic homeomorphism on the reduc-

tion of a coisotropic manifold

We now prove theorem 3. We ﬁrst show in section 4.1 that it is a straightforward conse-
quence of two points. One that reduces the framework to a standard situation (lemma 4.1,
proved in section 4.3), and a general result on the width of Lagrangian cylinders, which we
call a Lagrangian camel theorem (theorem 4.2, for which we give two independant proofs in
sections B and 5).

4.1 Proof of theorem 3

Theorem 3 states that under the hypothesis

(H) There exists a symplectic homeomorphism h that takes two coistropic submanifolds
ω
N 2m+l, N ′ one to another, and its reduction ˆh : ˆN → ˆN ′ veriﬁes ˆh(P m(a))
֒→ Z 2m(A),

we can conclude that A > a.

The ﬁrst point is to turn the general assumption (H) into a more speciﬁc one.

Its
proof relies on an approximation of homeomorphisms by diﬀeomorphisms (lemma 4.8), for
which we could ﬁnd a reference only in high dimensions. As a consequence, the proof of
theorem 3 which we present below only works when the dimension l of the characteristic
foliation is at least 6, which we assume henceforth in all this section. This however does not
aﬀect the generality of the theorem since, if l ≤ 5, we can consider the product symplectic
homeomorphism ˜f := f × Id : M × C6 → M ′ × C6, which takes the coisotropic ˜N := N × R6
to N ′ × R6. The reduction of ˜f and f coincide, but the corank of ω| ˜N is l + 6 ≥ 6.
Lemma 4.1. Under the assumption (H), for any a′ < a, there exists a symplectic embedding
f : P m(a′) × Rl ֒→ Cn = Cm+l such that

1. f is standard at inﬁnity: outside a compact set of P (a′) × Rl, f coincides with the

standard inclusion i(z, t) := (z, t) ∈ Cm × Cl for z ∈ P (a′) ⊂ Cm, t ∈ Rl.

2. f (P (a′) × Rl) ∩ {xm+1 = . . . = xn = 0} ⊂ Z(A) × i[−1, 1]l ⊂ Cm × Cl.

To be completely precise, we mean by this lemma that there exists a symplectic embedding
of a neighbourhood of P (a′) × Rl ⊂ Cm × Cl which veriﬁes the properties (1) and (2).
Focusing on the image of the distinguished boundary S1(a′)m ×Rl by f , we get a Lagrangian

13

embedding of a tube with Liouville class a′ into Cm × Cl which is standard at inﬁnity, and
crosses the wall Cm × iRl inside Z(A) × i[−1, 1]l.

The second point is a Lagrangian version of the Camel theorem:

Theorem 4.2 (Lagrangian Camel theorem). Let L be a Lagrangian embedding of (S1)m×Rl
into Cn with the following properties:

(i) L is properly embedded, standard at inﬁnity: there is a compact set K ⊂ Cn such that

L ∩ cK = S1(a)m × Rl ∩ cK = {π|zi|2 = a, i = 1 . . . m} × Rl ∩ cK ⊂ Cm × Cl.

(ii) L ∩ (Cm × iRn−m) ⊂ Z(A) × i[−1, 1]n−m.

Then a 6 A.

Applying this theorem to our situation, we get A > a′ for all a′ < a, so A > a.

(cid:3)

4.2 The reduction of a coisotropic submanifold

Here we extend basic deﬁnitions and properties of a (topological) reduction of a hypersurface
from [BO14] to the general case of a coisotropic submanifolds.
In fact, such notion of
reduction is quite general, if we forget the symplectic structure, and remember only the
smooth structure on Σ, together with the characteristic foliation. Hence we will deﬁne the
notion of a (topological) reduction for any manifold Σ endowed with a smooth foliation
F. The reduction carries a natural smooth structure, and moreover in case that Σ is
coisotropic and the foliation is the characteristic foliation on Σ, the reduction in addition
carries a natural symplectic structure.

Deﬁnition 4.3. Let Σm be a smooth manifold endowed with a foliation F, where dimension
of each leaf of the foliation equals r.

1. We say that an open topological submanifold 1 U m−r ⊂ Σ is (topologically) transverse
to the foliation F on Σ if U has a neighbourhood V ⊂ Σ such that U intersects exactly
once each leaf of V (where by a leaf of V we mean a connected component of the
intersection of V with a leaf of F).

2. Let U, U ′ ⊂ Σ be (m − r)-dimensional topological submanifolds, that are transverse
to the foliation F. We say that U and U ′ are equivalent (denoting U ∼ U ′) if there
exists a (continuous) homotopy G : W × [0, 1] → Σ, t ∈ [0, 1], of a topological manifold
W m−r, such that G|W ×{0} is a homeomorphism onto U , G|W ×{1} is a homeomorphism
onto U ′, and such that for each x ∈ W , the trajectory t 7→ G(x, t) goes along a leaf of
F.

1Recall that a topological submanifold of a topological manifold X is a subset Y ⊂ X, such that there
exists a topological manifold Z and a map i : Z → X which is a homeomorphism onto the image i(Z) = Y .

14

3. The reduction of a smooth manifold Σ endowed with a foliation F, denoted by Red (Σ, F),

is deﬁned as the set of open topological submanifolds U m−r ⊂ Σ which are transverse
to the characteristic foliation of Σ, considered modulo the above equivalence relation.
If Σ is a coisotropic (or, more generally, a pre-symplectic) submanifold of a symplectic
manifold M , and F is the characteristic foliation on Σ, then we simplify the notation
for the reduction to Red (Σ).

Now let us address several points:

4.2.1 Smooth and symplectic structures

On a topological submanifold U ⊂ Σ which is transverse to the foliation F, we have a
natural structure of a smooth manifold. Moreover, if Σ is a coisotropic (or, more generally,
a pre-symplectic) submanifold of a symplectic manifold, and F is the characteristic foliation
on Σ (we will call such situation a “symplectic setting”), then U moreover inherits a natural
symplectic structure. Indeed, let V be a neighbourhood of U in Σ such that U intersects
exactly once each characteristics of V , as in deﬁnition 4.3. Then any point z ∈ U has a
neighbourhood U1 ⊂ U such that U1 lies inside a (smooth) ﬂow-box Φ : W1 × (0, 1)r → Σ,
where Im Φ ⊂ V . Then the map ϕ := π ◦ Φ−1 : U1 → W1 is injective and hence, by
the Invariance of Domain theorem, is a homeomorphism onto the open image ϕ(U1) ⊂ W1
(here π : W1 × (0, 1)r → W1 is the natural projection). The map ϕ induces natural smooth
structure on U1, in case of a general foliation, and moreover induces natural symplectic
structure in U1 if we are in a symplectic setting.

4.2.2 Naturality of the structures

If two topological submanifolds U, U ′ ⊂ Σ are equivalent (U ∼ U ′), then they are dif-
feomorphic (and moreover symplectomorphic if we are in a symplectic setting) via a ho-
motopy G : W × [0, 1] → Σ, as in deﬁnition 4.3. Let us describe explicitly the diﬀeo-
morphism (resp. symplectomorphism) between U and U ′. By continuity of G and since
U is topologically transverse to leaves of the foliation F, for any point z ∈ W and any
t ∈ [0, 1] there exists a neighbourhood W1 ⋐ W of z such that the closure of the image
G(W1 × {t}) lies inside a (smooth) ﬂow-box Φ : W2 × (0, 1)r → Σ, and moreover the map
ϕt := π ◦Φ−1 ◦G : W1 ×{t} → W2 is injective (here π : W2 ×(0, 1)r → W2 is the natural pro-
jection, as before). Then, by the Invariance of Domain theorem, ϕt is a homeomorphism onto
the open image W3 := ϕt(W1) ⊂ W2. This induces a smooth (resp. symplectic) structure
on W1 ×{t}. Moreover, since W1 ⋐ W and G(W1 ×{t}) ⋐ Φ(W2 ×(0, 1)r), it follows that we
also have G(W1 × {t′}) ⋐ Φ(W2 × (0, 1)r) as well and moreover ϕt′ (z, t′) = ϕt(z, t) for every
z ∈ W1, whenever t′ ∈ [0, 1] is suﬃciently close to t (here ϕt′ = π◦Φ−1◦G : W1×{t′} → W2).
Hence the induced smooth (resp. symplectic) structures on W1 × {t} and on W1 × {t′} co-
incide, when t′ is suﬃciently close to t.

15

4.2.3 The induced map

Let h : Σ → Σ′ be a homeomorphism between smooth manifolds Σ and Σ′ which are en-
dowed with foliations F and F ′, such that h maps F to F ′. Then h deﬁnes a natural map
ˆh : Red (Σ, F) → Red (Σ′, F ′) by ˆh([U ]) := [h(U )] ⊂ Σ′. Clearly, the deﬁnition does not
depend on the representative U of [U ]. Recall that by a theorem of Humili`ere, Leclercq and
Seyfaddini [HLS15], if h : M → M ′ is a symplectic homeomorphism and if h maps a smooth
coisotropic submanifold Σ onto a smooth submanifold Σ′, then Σ′ is coisotropic, and the
restriction h|Σ : Σ → Σ′ preserves the characteristic foliation, and hence we get a natural
induced map ˆh : Red (Σ) → Red (Σ′).

Proposition 4.4. Let ϕ : W m−r → Σ be a topological embedding of a topological manifold
W without boundary, ϕ(W ) = U ⊂ Σ, such that the image U = ϕ(W ) ⊂ Σ is (topolog-
ically) transverse to a foliation F of Σ, and let V ⊂ Σ be its neighbourhood such that U
intersects exactly once each leaf of F in V . Consider on U the natural smooth structure as
in section 4.2.1, and the smooth structure on W induced by the map ϕ. Let A ⊂ W be a
closed subset such that ϕ is smooth in a neighbourhood of A. Then there exists a smooth
embedding ˜ϕ : W → V such that:

1. eU = ˜ϕ(W ) is transverse (in the standard smooth sense) to F,
2. U and eU are equivalent in V (in particular, eU intersects exactly once each leaf of F

in V ),

3. ˜ϕ = ϕ on A.

This proposition in particular implies that any element of the reduction of a hypersurface

admits a globally smooth representative (by considering A = ∅).

Proof of proposition 4.4: For any open W ⊂ W , we say that a ﬂow-box Φ : W × (0, 1)r →
V ⊂ Σ is admissible if for any y ∈ W we have ϕ(y) ∈ Φ({y} × (0, 1)r).

Around each x ∈ W , there exists an open neighbourhood Wx ⊂ V of x and a smooth
ﬂow-box Φx : Wx × (0, 1)r → V ⊂ Σ which is admissible. After shrinking each Wx if
necessary, we can assume that for some sequence of points x1, x2, . . . ∈ W , the union
∪∞
i=1Wxi is a locally ﬁnite covering of W . Denote Wi := Wxi and Φi := Φxi. In each Wi we

can ﬁnd an open subset cWi, compactly contained in Wi, such that cW1,cW2, . . . still cover

We consequently change ϕ and our cover {Wj} of W in an inﬁnite number of steps, such
that in the limit we get a smooth embedding ϕ. Let i ∈ N, and let us describe the step i.
For any j = 1, 2, . . . we choose some relatively open W ′
j ⋐ Wj. We
have

W .

Φ−1

i (U ∩ Im Φi) = {(y, gi(y)) | y ∈ Wi},

j in W with cWj ⋐ W ′

where gi : Wi → (0, 1)r is a continuous map. By a convolution argument there exists a

continuous map ˜gi : Wi → (0, 1)r which is smooth on cWi, and which coincides with gi on

16

on W \ Wi, and such that ϕ′(y) = Φi(y, ˜gi(y)) for every y ∈ Wi. Due to the local ﬁniteness
of the cover {Wj} of W , if we choose ˜gi to be close enough to gi, we can assume that the
restriction of Φj to W ′
j × (0, 1)r is admissible (in the sense that is described at the beginning

(Op (A)∩cWi)∪(Wi\cWi). Now deﬁne a topological embedding ϕ′ : W → V , such that ϕ′ = ϕ
i+1i → V , such

each x ∈ W , the trajectory t 7→ G(x, t) goes along a leaf of F. Now replace ϕ by ϕ′, and
for each j replace Wj by W ′
j.

It is clear that along the steps, the map ϕ stabilises on compact subsets of W , and
that the “limiting” ϕ is a smooth embedding into V which is transverse to F (in the usual
smooth sense), and which is equivalent to the embedding ϕ via the constructed homotopy
G.

Given a topological submanifold U m−r ⊂ Σ transverse to the foliation F of Σ, choose

some neighbourhood V of U in Σ, and then pick a smooth submanifold eU ⊂ Σ, as in propo-
sition 4.4. Then eU carries the ”normal vector bundle N (eU , F) tangent to the foliation F”.
More precisely, N (eU , F) is the union of TxF , where x ∈ eU , F is a leaf of F, and x ∈ F .
Naturally, N (eU , F) is a smooth vector bundle over eU , and we will consider it as a vector
bundle over U , via the natural identiﬁcation between eU and U given by the homotopy
sition 4.5 below, that all N (eU , F) are isomorphic, via isomorphisms that commute with
natural projections N (eU , F) → U . We denote by bN (U, F) the corresponding isomorphism

between them (constructed in the proof of proposition 4.4). It readily follows from propo-

class given by these vector bundles.

Proposition 4.5. Let U, U ′ ⊂ Σ be (m-r)-dimensional smooth submanifolds transverse (in
the standard smooth sense) to the foliation F of Σ, such that U and U ′ are equivalent,
i.e. there exists a (continuous) homotopy G : W × [0, 1] → Σ as in deﬁnition 4.3. Then
N (U, F) and N (U ′, F) are isomorphic, via an isomorphism that commutes with the natural
projections N (U, F) → U , N (U ′, F) → U ′ (where U and U ′ are identiﬁed via the homotopy
G).

Another immediate corollary from proposition 4.5 is that the isomorphism class bN (U, F)

depends only on the element of the equivalence class deﬁned by U (i.e. depends only on
the corresponding element of the reduction).

Proof of proposition 4.5: Consider on W the smooth structure induced by the smooth
structure on U via the map G(·, 0) : W → U . Then G(·, 0) : W → U and G(·, 1) : W → U ′
are diﬀeomorphisms. Pick a Riemannian metric g on Σ. It is clear that in any open subset
V compactly contained in Σ, any two suﬃciently close points y and y′ lying on the same
leaf F of F, can be joined by a unique minimal geodesic γy,y′ in F , such that γy,y′ depends

17

smoothly on the points y, y′ (and does not depend on V). We call such y, y′ F-geodesically
close.

Now, choose a monotone non-decreasing sequence of smooth compactly supported func-
tions ui : W → [0, 1], i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., such that u0 ≡ 0 on W , and such that on any compact
subset of W we have ui ≡ 1 for large i. Then, by the latter observation, we can add func-
tions to the sequence (ui) if necessary, such that denoting Ui = {G(x, ui(x)) | x ∈ W } for
i > 0, each Ui is suﬃciently close to Ui+1, and in particular each Ui admits a neighbourhood
Vi in Σ, such that any y ∈ Vi and y′ ∈ Vi+1 lying on the same leaf of F are F-geodesically
close. Choose an exhaustion W0 ⋐ W1 ⋐ W2 ⋐ . . . of W by non-empty open sets, such that
ui ≡ 1 on Wi for each i. Denote ψi(x) = G(x, ui(x)), x ∈ W , i > 0.

Let i > 1. We have ψi|Wi ≡ G(·, 1)|Wi , hence ψi|Wi : Wi → ψi(Wi) is a smooth embed-
ding. Moreover, Wi−1 ⊂ Wi. Therefore, by proposition 4.4 there exists a smooth embedding

˜ψi : W → Vi, such that eUi := ˜ψi(W ) is transverse (in the standard smooth sense) to F,
such that Ui and eUi are equivalent in Vi, and such that ˜ψi = ψi on Wi−1. In addition, put

For each i > 0, the map τi := ˜ψi+1 ◦ ˜ψ−1

: Wi → Wi+1 is a diﬀeomorphism. Moreover,
we can use the Levi-Civita connection of the metric g on each leaf F of F, to deﬁne linear

˜ψ0 = ψ0.

i

contains x and τi(x), and Ti,x is the parallel transport along the curve γx,τi(x). The inﬁ-

isomorphisms Ti,x : TxFi,x → Tτi(x)Fi,x, x ∈ eUi, i > 0, where Fi,x is the leaf of F that
nite composition of T0,x, T1,x, T2,x, . . . stabilises for each x ∈ eU0 = U , and deﬁnes a desired

smooth bundle isomorphism between N (U, F) and N (U ′, F).

(cid:3)

Proposition 4.6. Let U ⊂ Σ be a topological submanifold transverse to a foliation F on Σ,
endowed with the smooth structure deﬁned in section 4.2.1. Consider a smooth Riemannian

metric h on any representative of bN (U, F) which by abuse of notation we denote by N (U, F).

Then there exists a (smooth) ﬂow-box Φ : N1(U, F) → Σ, where N1(U, F) is the open unit
disc tangent bundle of the metric h on N (U, F), and such that:

1. U ⊂ Im Φ,

2. Φ−1(U ) ⊂ N1(U, F) deﬁnes a continuous section of the disc bundle N1(U, F) → U .

Proof of proposition 4.6: Pick a Riemannian metric g on Σ. For any leaf F of the foliation
F and any x ∈ F , denote by expx : TxF → F the exponential map of g on F , and denote
by BF (x, ρ) ⊂ TxF the g-ball of radius ρ, for ρ > 0.

Let V ⊂ Σ be an open neighbourhood of U as in deﬁnition 4.3. One can easily ﬁnd a
smaller open neighbourhood V ′ of U , and a smooth function ε : V ′ → R, such that for any
y ∈ V ′, if F is the leaf of F that contains y, the restriction ψy = exp|BF (y,ε(y)) : BF (ε(y)) →
F is a smooth embedding, Im ψy ⊂ V , and if x ∈ U is the unique point lying on the same
leaf F , then we have x ∈ Im ψy. By proposition 4.4 there exists a smooth submanifold

eU ⊂ V ′ such that eU is transverse (in the standard smooth sense) to F, and U and eU are

equivalent in V .

Now denote by h the metric on the bundle N (eU , F) induced by g, and deﬁne Φ :
N1(eU , F) → Σ by Φ(x, v) = expx(ε(x)v), v ∈ BF (x, 1), x ∈ eU . Then Φ is a desired
resentative bN (U, F) and a Riemannian metric h on the bundle N (eU , F), the proposition

follows.

4.3 From local to global

The aim of this section is to establish lemma 4.1, which states that under an assumption

(H) There exists a symplectic homeomorphism h that takes two coistropic submanifolds
ω
N 2m+l, N ′ one to another, and its reduction ˆh : ˆN → ˆN ′ veriﬁes ˆh(P m(a))
֒→ Z 2m(A),

one can construct a certain symplectic embedding of P (a′)m × Rl into Cm+l (for any a′ < a).
The proof consists in modifying in successive stages our symplectic homeomorphism, or its
smooth approximations, turning them into more and more standard objects, so that the
ﬁnal extension becomes almost straightforward. We ﬁx in the following a′ < a. Moreover,
we consider coordinates (z, x, y) on Cn = Cm+l ∼= Cm × Rl × Rl. Hence x, y stand for
elements of Rl throughout this section. Finally, for a point p ∈ Cm+l, we denote by px its
x-coordinates.

Section 4.2 explains the actual content of our assumption (H).

It means that there
exists a topological submanifold U 2m ⊂ N 2m+l, transverse to the characteristic foliation F
of N , such that:

• When endowed with its structure of smooth symplectic manifold (see §4.2.1), U is

symplectomorphic to a polydisc P m(a),

• W = h(U ) ⊂ N ′ is then topologically transverse to the characteristic foliation by
[HLS15], and again endowed with its structure of smooth symplectic manifold, W
symplectically embeds into Z 2m(A). In particular, W can be seen as an open subset
of (R2m, ωst).

Since U, W are contractible, it is clear from the deﬁnition that bN (U, F) and bN (W, F ′) are

trivial vector bundles. Thus, proposition 4.6 ensures that U, W lie in smooth ﬂow-boxes
of the characteristic foliations: U ⊂ Im ϕ, W ⊂ Im ϕ′, where ϕ : P m(a) × (−1, 1)l ֒→ N ,
ϕ′ : W × (−1, 1)l ֒→ N ′. By reducing the ﬂow boxes (by decreasing slightly a and reducing
the ﬁbers of the foliation), we can even assume that the ﬂow box ϕ is deﬁned on U ×[−2, 2]l,
and we have h(ϕ(U × [−2, 2]l)) ⊂ ϕ′(W × (−1, 1)l). Considering ﬁnally symplectic extension
Φ, Φ′ of these ﬂow boxes to small neighbourhoods V and V ′ respectively, such that h(Φ(V)) ⊂
Φ′(V ′) and deﬁning h1 := (Φ′)−1 ◦ h|Im Φ ◦ Φ, we therefore get:

Lemma 4.7. Under the assumption (H), for any 0 < a′ < a there exist an open subset W ⊂
Z 2m(A), neighbourhoods V, V ′ of P (a′) × [−2, 2]l, W × (−1, 1)l in Cm+l, and a symplectic

19

homeomorphism h1 : V → V ′, such that:

h1(P m(a′) × [−2, 2]l) ⊂ W × (−1, 1)l ⊂ Z(A) × (−1, 1)l ⊂ Cm+l.

Lemma 4.8. Let us ﬁx ε > 0. Under the assumption (H), for any 0 < a′ < a there exist
W, V, V ′ as in lemma 4.7 and a symplectic homeomorphism h2 : V → V ′, such that:

( h2(P (a′) × [−1, 1]l) ⊂ W × (−2, 2)l ⊂ Z(A) × (−2, 2)l,

kh2(z, t, y)x − tk < ε

∀(z, t, y) ∈ V ⊂ Cm × Cl ≈ Cm × Rl × Rl.

Proof: Choose some a′ < a′′ < a, and consider a symplectic homeomorphism h1 : V → V ′
associated by lemma 4.7 to the value a′′. By [HLS15], the restriction of h1 to P m(a′′) ×
[−2, 2]l is of the form (ˆh1(z), ϕ1(z, t)). Denote W ′ = ˆh1(P (a′′)), W = h1(P (a′)), and denote
ϕ1,z(t) := ϕ1(z, t). The map (z, t) 7→ ϕ1(z, t) is continuous, and its restrictions ϕ1(c, ·) to
slices z = c are topological embeddings of [−2, 2]l into (−1, 1)l.

Since h1 is a homeomorphism, we can clearly assume that ε is small enough so that
dC0(ϕ1(z, t), ϕ1(z, t′)) < ε =⇒ dC0(t, t′) < 1/3, ∀z ∈ P (a′), t, t′ ∈ [−2, 2]l. By the same
reason, there exists 0 < δ < ε such that dC0(ϕ1(z, t), ϕ1(z, t′)) < δ =⇒ dC0(t, t′) < ε,
∀z ∈ P (a′), t, t′ ∈ [−2, 2]l.

By theorem A.1, since l ≥ 6, there exists a smooth slice embedding:

Φδ

: W ′ × [−5/3, 5/3]l

(z, t)

֒−→ W ′ × (−2, 2)l
7−→ (z, ϕδ(z, t)),

such that ∀z ∈ W ′, t ∈ [−5/3, 5/3]l, we have dC0(cid:0)ϕδ(z, t), ϕ1(ˆh−1

ϕδ(z, t). First of all, by our choice of ε, we have ϕδ,z((−4/3, 4/3)l) ⊃ ϕ1,z′([−1, 1]l), when
z′ = h−1

1 (z), t)(cid:1) < δ. Put ϕδ,z(t) :=

1 (z) ∈ P (a′). Indeed, for t ∈ [−1, 1]l we have

dC0(t, ∂[−4/3, 4/3]l) > 1/3 =⇒ dC0(ϕ1,z′(t), ϕ1,z′(∂[−4/3, 4/3]l)) > ε,

and then, from dC0(ϕ1,z′, ϕδ,z) < δ < ε we conclude ϕ1,z′(t) ∈ ϕδ,z((−4/3, 4/3)l). We conclude
that Φδ(W × (−4/3, 4/3)l) ⊃ h1(W × [−1, 1]l). The restriction Φδ|W ×[−4/3,4/3]l extends to a
symplectic diﬀeomorphism ˜Φδ : V ′ → V ′ (with compact support in V ′).

Putting h2 := ( ˜Φδ)−1 ◦ h1, we get a symplectic homeomorphism h2 : V → V ′.

It
veriﬁes h2(P m(a′) × [−1, 1]l) ⊂ W × (−2, 2)l. Moreover, writing h2(z, t) = (ˆh2(z), ϕ2(z, t)),
we have ˆh2 = ˆh1, and ϕ2(z, t) = ϕ−1
◦ ϕ1,z(t) for (z, t) ∈ P (a′) × [−1, 1]l. We claim
that we moreover have dC0(ϕ2(z, t), t) < ε for all z ∈ P (a′), t ∈ [−1, 1]l. Indeed, denote
t′ = ϕ2(z, t) = ϕ−1

◦ ϕ1,z(t). Then ϕδ,ˆh1(z)(t′) = ϕ1,z(t), hence

δ,ˆh1(z)

δ,ˆh1(z)

dC0(ϕ1,z(t′), ϕ1,z(t)) = dC0(ϕ1,z(t′), ϕδ,ˆh1(z)(t′)) < δ =⇒ dC0(t, t′) < ε,

by our choice of δ.

We conclude that ˆh2(P (a′)) = W , and d(ϕ2(z, t), t) < ε for (z, t) ∈ P (a′) × [−1, 1]l. Now
shrink V to a suﬃciently small neighbourhood of P (a′)× [−1, 1]l, and replace V ′ accordingly
by h2(V).

Lemma 4.9. Let us ﬁx ε > 0. Under the assumption (H), there exist W, V, V ′ as in lemma
4.7, with 0 ∈ W and a symplectic diﬀeomorphism f3 : V → V ′ such that

f3(P (a′) × [−1, 1]l) ⊂ Vε(W × [−1, 1]l),
f3 ≡ Id in a neighbourhood Op (0 × [−1, 1]l) in Cm+l,
kf3(z, t, y)x − tk < ε

∀(z, t, y) ∈ V.

(4.3.1)

(4.3.2)

Proof: Let h2 : ˜V → ˜V ′ be the symplectic homeomorphism associated by lemma 4.8 to values
a′′ ∈ (a′, a), and ε′ < ε to be deﬁned precisely later on in the proof . Call W ′ := ˆh2(P (a′′))
and W := ˆh2(P (a′)). Obviously, we can act by translation on Cn to ensure that 0 ∈ W ,
and that ˆh2(0) = 0. We therefore have:

h2(P (a′′) × [−1, 1]l) = W ′ × [−1, 1]l ⊂ Z(A) × [−1, 1]l,
kh2(z, t, y)x − tk < ε′ ∀z, t, y ∈ ˜V,
h2(0 × [−1, 1]l) = 0 × [−1, 1]l and dC0(h2|0×[−1,1]l, Id ) < ε′.

Since h2 is a symplectic homeomorphism, it can be ε′-approximated in the C0-distance by
a symplectic diﬀeomorphism f : V → V ′, where V is an arbitrary interior approximation of
˜V (in particular P (a′) × [−1, 1]l ⋐ V). Hence, the restriction of f to 0 × [−1, 1]l veriﬁes:

dC0(f|0×[−1,1]l, Id ) < 2ε′.

By theorem 2.1, there exists a Hamiltonian isotopy (ϕt) with support in V ′, of size 2Cε′,
where C depends only on the dimension, such that ϕ1 ◦ f|(−δ,δ)m×[−1,1]l = Id , for some
small δ > 0. This implies that (ϕ1 ◦ f )′(p) = Id at any point p ∈ 0 × [−1, 1]l (because
(ϕ1 ◦ f )′(p) is a symplectic linear map which equals the identity on the Lagrangian subspace
Rm × Rl ⊂ Cn). The following claim is a direct consequence of Moser’s continuity method:

Claim 4.10. There exists a symplectic diﬀeomorphism f3 : V → V ′ which is arbitrarily
C1-close to ϕ1 ◦ f (say ε′), and equals the identity in a neighbourhood of {0} × [−1, 1]l in
Cn.

Then f3 veriﬁes (4.3.1) by deﬁnition. Moreover,

dC0(f3, h2) ≤ dC0(f3, ϕ1 ◦ f ) + dC0(ϕ1 ◦ f, h2) < (2 + 2C)ε′,

and

kf3(z, t, y)x − tk ≤ kf3(z, t, y)x − h2(z, t, y)xk + kh2(z, t, y)x − tk

≤ (2 + 2C)ε′ + ε′ = (3 + 2C)ε′.

Choosing ε′ so that ε = (3 + 2C)ε′, we get all the desired estimates.

(cid:3)

For the sake of completeness, we justify now our claim 4.10. It is a particular case of a more
general lemma:

Lemma 4.11. Let V, V ′ ⊂ R2n, f : V → V ′ a symplectic diﬀeomorphism, K ⋐ V a compact
submanifold ﬁxed by f , and such that f ′
|K = Id , and δ > 0. There exists a symplectic
diﬀeomorphism F : V → V ′, which coincides with f outside an arbitrary neighbourhood of
K, with dC0(F, f ) < δ, and F ≡ Id in Op (K).

21

Of course, in this lemma, the fact that V, V ′ are open subset of R2n is completely
irrelevant, although it helps in writing down a proof. Since it suﬃces for our claim, we
choose to present this particular case. Also, the fact that K is a submanifold is not so
important: we only need that the distance to K is smooth in Op (K)\K, and even this
might be dropped by a more carefull proof.

Proof: Let r : V → R+ denote the distance to K: r(·) := d(·, K). Since K is a submanifold,

this function is smooth on Op (K)\K. Since K is compact, r is even smooth on r−1(cid:0)(0, α)(cid:1),

for some α > 0. Let now δ < α/2, intended to be small, and ρ : [0, α] → [0, 1] be a smooth
function with ρ ≡ 1 on r < δ, ρ ≡ 0 on r > 2δ, and kρ′k∞ < 2/δ. Deﬁne now the smooth
map g : V → R2n by g := ρ ◦ r Id + (1 − ρ ◦ r)f on r < α and g = f on r > α. Then g ≡ Id
near K, coincides with f on the complement of {r < 2δ} ⋐ V, and dC1(f, g) < Cδ for some
constant C that might depend on f but not on δ. Indeed,

f (z) − g(z) = ρ ◦ r(z)(cid:0)f (z) − z(cid:1)
f ′(z) − g′(z) = ρ ◦ r(z)(cid:0)f ′(z) − Id(cid:1) + (ρ ◦ r)′(z)(cid:0)f (z) − z(cid:1).

The estimate therefore follows from the facts that ρ ◦ r vanishes on r > 2δ, f (z) − z ∈
O(r(z)2), f ′(z) − Id ∈ O(r(z)).

As a consequence, g is a diﬀeomorphism for δ small enough, g : V → V ′, and ω1 := g∗ω

is a symplectic form on V with the following properties:

• ω1 = ω on {r < δ} ∪ {r > 2δ},
• kω1 − ωk∞ ∈ O(δ) because g′ − f ′ ∈ O(δ) and f ′ is symplectic,
• ω1 − ω is exact because it does not vanish only on a regular neighbourhood of K

(which retracts on K), but vanishes on K.

Therefore, the classical Moser’s method, applied to the family ωt := tω1 + (1 − t)ω, provides
a C0-small diﬀeomorphism Φ : V → V with Φ∗ω1 = ω, and Φ ≡ Id on the complement of
{δ < r < 2δ}. The map F := g ◦ Φ satisﬁes the requirement of our lemma.
(cid:3)

Proof of lemma 4.1: Let f3 be the symplectic diﬀeomorphism provided by lemma 4.9, for
a value a′′ ∈ (a′, a), ε = 1/20. Our aim is to construct, out of f3, a symplectic embedding
f : Op (P m(a′) × Rl) ֒→ Cm+l which is the identity in the complement of a compact set, and
veriﬁes f (P (a′) × Rl) ∩ {x = 0} ⊂ Z(A) × i[−1, 1]l. By standard neighbourhood theorems
(P (a′) × Rl is coisotropic), it is moreover enough to deﬁne our embedding on P (a′) × Rl,
since such a symplectic embedding will automatically extend to a neighbourhood .

On Cn ⊃ P (a′′) × [−1, 1]l, still with coordinates (z, x, y), we consider the contracting

Indeed, the vector ﬁeld Xst is deﬁned on the whole of Cm+l, while f3∗X0 is deﬁned on
Im f3 ⊂ Cm+l, which is contractible (in particular simply connected). The forms λst :=
ωst(Xst, ·) and λ := ωst(f3∗X0, ·) therefore diﬀer on Im f3 by the diﬀerential of a function

5 The Lagrangian camel theorem: Eliashberg’s approach

Let L be the image of a Lagrangian embedding of S1(a)m × Rn−m into Cn, that veriﬁes the
hypothesis of theorem 4.2:

23

(i) For some compact set K ∩ Cn, L coincides with S1(a)m × Rn−m ⊂ Cm × Cn−m on cK,

(ii) L ∩ Cm × iRn−m ⊂ Z(A) × iRn−m.

We need to show that a 6 A. We consider the coordinates (z, q + ip) on Cn, where z ∈ Cm,
q ∈ Rn−m, p ∈ Rn−m. We also decompose z = (z1, z′), where Z(A) = D(A)z1 × Cm−1

.

z′

The idea is to ﬁll Γ := ∂Z(A) × iRn−m by holomorphic discs for convenient almost
complex structures J, all with symplectic area A. Since L is knotted with Γ, one of the
discs (say D(J)) of the ﬁlling must intersect L. If this procedure is done for a family Jε
of almost complex structures that ”stretch the neck” of L, the discs D(Jε) degenerate in
the sense of Symplectic Field Theory to a holomorphic building [BEH+03]. The exterior
component is a disc with punctures, exactly one positive and at least one negative. The
action of the positive puncture is A, and the action of the negative puncture is an integer
multiple of a, and their diﬀerence must be positive.

Proof of theorem 4.2: It is clear that the Lagrangian subamnifold L can be used to produce
a Lagrangian embedding of S1(a)m × Tn−m into Cm × T ∗Tn−m, still denoted L, which
veriﬁes:

(i) The natural projection of L to Tn−m has degree 1,

(ii) L ∩ Cm × T ∗
0

Tn−m ⊂ Z(A) × T ∗
0

Tn−m ≃ Z(A) × Rn−m.

By (ii), and since L is now compact, there exists ε > 0 such that the intersection of L with
Cm × T ∗
0

Tn−m lies inside the large ellipsoid

π(cid:18) |z1|2

A

+ ε(kz′k2 + kpk2(cid:19) ,

and L lies in the domain Ω := {χ(z, p, q) < 1}, where

χ(z, p, q) = πt(q)(cid:18) |z1|2

A

+ ε(kz′k2 + kpk2)(cid:19) ,

and t is a radial positive function of q, that equals 1 on a neighbourhood of 0 and decreases
very fast to ε. The domain Ω is compact and ωst-convex because its boundary is transverse
to the Liouville vector ﬁeld

with Γ.

Tn−m. By assumption (i), L is knotted

Step I: Filling by holomorphic discs. Since Ω is ωst-convex,
it is J-convex for a
compatible almost complex structure, which can be assumed to coincide with Jst near Γ.

24

We ﬁx from now on such an almost-complex structure J∂Ω, a neighbourhood V of ∂Ω in Ω
which does not meet L, and we deﬁne

J (∂Ω) := {J ω-compatible, J|V = J∂Ω}.

The aim of this ﬁrst step is the following lemma:

Lemma 5.1. For all J ∈ J (∂Ω), there exists a J-disc uJ : (D, ∂D) → (Ω, Γ), with
Aω(uJ ) 6 A, and Im uJ ∩ L 6= ∅.

By the linking assumption (i), this is a straigthforward consequence of the ﬁlling of Γ

with J-discs, exactly as for Eliashberg-Gromov’s proof of the Camel theorem [EG91]:

Lemma 5.2. Let ∆k denote the standard k-dimensionnal simplex, and let W := D ×
∆n+m−2. For generic J ∈ J (∂Ω), there exists a continuous application σ : (W, ∂W ) →
(Ω, Γ), such that deg(∂σ : ∂W → Γ) = 1, σ|D×{∗} is J-holomorphic and has symplectic area
at most A.

The argument in [EG91] refers to [Gro85], and may be considered sketchy. The proof
of lemma 5.2 has been cautiously written in dimension 4 in [MT93], and the part of the
argument that we need here (in order to ﬁll Γ by a non-necessarily embedded topological
ball) generalizes without diﬃculty to arbitrary dimension. For the sake of completeness, we
review the argument in higher dimension, refering to [MT93] when possible, or to the very
good exposition paper [Nie14].

For c ∈ Rm, kck 6 1/ε, denote Sc := Γ ∩ {Re z′ = c}. This is a totally real sphere
with elliptic singularities along the codimension 2 submanifold {z1 = 0}. Notice that since

J ∈ J (Ω), J = Jst near Γ, so the discs Dz′,p := D(cid:0)A(1 − ε(kz′k2 + kpk2))(cid:1) × {(z′, p, 0)}

(with Re z′ = c) have boundaries on Sc, are J-holomorphic for k(z′, p)k ≫ 1 (hence near
Sc ∩ {z1 = 0}). They represent a class [D] ∈ H2(Ω, Sc\{z1 = 0}). We deﬁne

Mc(J) := {u : (D, ∂D) → (Ω, Sc), du ◦ j = J ◦ du, [u] = [D] ∈ H2(Ω, Sc)},
M(J) := ∪cMc(J).

Since [D] is a primitive class, the elements of M(J) are somewhere injective. Moreover, no
element of M can remain in V because ∂Ω is J-convex, so standard Fredholm theory ensures
that for generic J ∈ J (∂ω), M(J) is a smooth manifold (see [MT93, §4]). It is explained
in full detail in [Nie14, Proposition II.2.6] that any J-holomorphic disc with boundary in
Sc, that intersects some neighbourhood of Sc ∩ {z1 = 0} has to be one of the discs Dz′,p (up
to coverings). This ensures that the issue of non-compactness of the moduli-space M(J)
can only be caused by bubbling of spheres (this is impossible because π2(Ω) = 0), or side-
bubbling. In order to discard the latter, we have to introduce the so-called ”characteristic
foliation” F of the sphere Sc, deﬁned as the integral foliation of the distribution

D := T C∂Ω ∩ T Sc,

where T C∂Ω = T ∂Ω ∩ JstT ∂Ω. Since (ω, J) are standard near Γ, T C∂Ω = h ~N , J ~N i⊥,
where ~N is the normal to ∂Ω with respect to the standard euclidean scalar product g, and

25

the orthogonal complement is to be understood with respect to g also. Thus, a deﬁning
1-form for D is simply α := g(J ~N , ·)|T Sc = hJ ~N , ·i|T Sc. What prevents disc-bubbling is the
so-called ”Hopf’s lemma”: if u : (D, ∂D) → (Ω, ∂Ω) is a holomorphic disc, the derivative ∂u
∂r
∂θ projects positively to J ~N (see [Nie14, corollary II.1.7,II.1.11]).
is transverse to ∂Ω, and ∂u

Lemma 5.3. If u : (D, ∂D) → (Ω, Sc) is J-holomorphic for some J ∈ J (∂Ω), then γ(θ) :=
∂u(θ) veriﬁes:

α( ˙γ(θ)) = hJ ~N (γ(θ)), ˙γ(θ)i > 0.

Note that when ε ≪ 1, the leaves of F are C1-close to the n − 1-dimensional aﬃne
subspaces (z1, Re z′, q) = ({∗}, c, 0) on compact sets. Thus lemma 5.3 guarantees that every
holomorphic disc with boundary on Sc represents a positive multiple of [D] in H2(Ω, Sc) (we
recall that such a disc cannot approach Sc ∩ {z1 = 0}). But disc bubbling would provide
a representation of the class [D] as a bunch of J-discs with boundaries on Sc, which is
therefore impossible.

Once compactness has been dealt with, the argument to get the ﬁlling is word for word
the same as [MT93, §4]. We get that for generic J ∈ J (∂Ω), Sc is ﬁlled by J-holomorphic
discs in class [D]: there exists σc : (D × ∆n−1, ∂(D × ∆n−1) → (Ω, Sc) with σc|D×{∗} is
J-holomorphic, and such that deg ∂σc = 1. The map σ(c, x) 7→ σc(x) then veriﬁes that
σD×{∗} is J-holomorphic, that deg(∂σ : W → Γ) = 1. It only remains to prove that the
symplectic areas of the discs σ|D×{∗} do not exceed A.

Lemma 5.4. Let u : (D, ∂D) → (Ω, Sc) be a J-holomorphic disc, which represents the class
[D]. Then, Aω(u) 6 A.

Proof: Recall that in a neighbourhood of Cm × T ∗

∂Ω =(cid:26)π(cid:18) |z1|2

c = 0 and any almost complex structure J ∈ J (∂Ω), because the translation by c preserves
the symplectic structure, Jst and send S0 to Sc. At a point of S0, the normal vector is

that:

Deﬁne now ~Z := ∂/∂r1 and ~Z(θ) := ~Z(γ(θ)) (so ω( ~Z(θ), ˙γ(θ)) > 0). Let now f : [0, 2π] → R+
be such that the points ˜γ(θ) := γ(θ)+ f (θ) ~Z(θ) belong to π|z1|2 = A. Then, ˜γ(θ) belongs to
the Lagrangian cylinder {π|z1|2 = A, Re z′ = 0, q = 0}, so the action of ˜γ equals A(˜γ) = A.
Let now w(s, θ) := γ(θ) + sf (θ) ~Z(θ). Then,

Aω(u) = A(γ) = A(˜γ) − Aω(w) = A − A(w),

and we claim that w is symplectic (which clearly concludes our proof). Indeed,

Step II: Stretching the neck. Recall now that L is the image by an exact lagrangian
embedding ι of L0 := S1(a)n−m × Tm. Consider on L the metric g := ι∗gst where gst
is the restriction of the euclidean metric in Cn to L0. As usual in SFT, we consider a
neighbourhood U of L symplectomorphic to a neighbourhood of the zero section in T ∗L,
endow it with the metric g induced canonically from g|L, and consider Σ := {g = ε0} ⊂ U .
For small enough ε0, this is a contact type hypersurface which splits Ω into two pieces
Ω− ∪ Ω+, where Ω− has concave boundary at Σ (and contains ∂Ω), and Ω+ has convex
boundary (and contains L). Now we consider a neck-stretching along Σ. Notice that since
L ⋐ Ω, the same holds for Σ provided ε0 is small enough, so we can consider a degeneration
Jε of the complex structure with the following properties.

• Jε = J∂Ω near ∂Ω. So Ω is Jε-convex, and the procedure of the second step can be
carried on, to produce a Jε-disc uε : (D, ∂D) → (Ω, Γ), with area A and Im uε ∩ L 6= ∅.

• Jε stretches the neck of Σ when the parameter ε goes to +∞.

Since the discs uε remain in the compact domain Ω, the compactness theorem in SFT
implies that there is some εn such that un := uεn converge to a holomorphic building B
[BEH+03], whose main features are summarized below:

•

∞ : S → Ω−,
It has a main component, in Ω−, which is a J∞-holomorphic map umain
where S is a punctured discs (with p punctures, p > 1 because un intersects L, hence
Ω+), and whose boundary is sent to Γ and has action A.

27

• All other components on Ω−, Ω+ are J∞-holomorphic maps whose domains are punc-

tured spheres (because the un are discs).

• The components of the building in Ω− are asymptotic at each puncture to a negative
Reeb orbit of ∂Ω− = Σ (the boundary of the image is oriented by the opposite of the
Reeb ﬂow). Similarly, the components in Ω+ are asymptotic to positive Reeb orbits
of Σ.

• There might be intermediate layers: components of B in Σ × R (the symplectization
of Σ). These components are J-holomorphic for some cylindrical almost complex
structure, again punctured spheres, asymptotic to positive Reeb orbits of Σ × {+∞}
and negative Reeb orbits at Σ × {−∞}.

• The total symplectic area of these components is A, and they glue together to form a
topological disc (see ﬁgure 1). We will refer to this last property by saying that the
building B forms a disc.

Ω−

L

Figure 1: A holomorphic building.

In the following, we neglect the intermediate layers, and argue as if there were none.
This simpliﬁcation only avoids extra-notations, and a general proof can easily been extracted
from the argument given. Denote by −γ1, . . . , −γp the (negative) Reeb orbits to which umain
is asymptotic. Since B forms a disc, its other components glue together to form p discs
asymptotic to γ1, . . . , γp. Since the γi are Reeb orbits, they project to closed geodesics of
L under the natural projection π : Ω+ ≃ T ∗
ε0L → L (recall that Ω+ ≃ {g < ε0}). We write
ℓ eℓ ∈ H1(L) for the homology classes of these geodesics, where eℓ is the class
ℓ ∈ Z. Observe at this point that since γi bounds
ℓ = 0 for ℓ > m − n (because Ω ⊂ Cn−m × T ∗Tm). We will use the

of the ℓ-th S1-factor in L ≃ (S1)n, and k(i)
a topological disc, k(i)
following obvious fact:

∞

[πγ] =P k(i)

Lemma 5.6. For each i,P k(i)

Observe that πSi provides a chain whose boundary is [πγi] +P[πγj

Proof: Denote by Si the connected component of B in Ω+ which is glued to umain
∞ along γi.
This components cannot be a disc because πγi is non-contractible in Ω+ ⊂ T ∗Tn. Therefore,
Si has boundary components asymptotic to positive Reeb orbits γi, γ1

But since B forms a disc, there is a disc with positive area - composed of a gluing of diﬀerent
components of B - which is asymptotic to each −γj
i . Gluing to these discs the cylinders ργj

we get discs with positive area, whose boundaries lie in L and represent the class −[πγj

A Approximation of homeomorphisms by diﬀeomorphisms

Given a parameter space ∆, which will always be a ball in our case, and two manifolds
M, W , a slice map F : ∆ × M → ∆ × W is a map of the form (t, x) 7→ (t, f (t, x)). The aim
of this section is to provide a proof of the following:

Theorem A.1. Let ∆ be a ball of dimension n, l ≥ 6, Bl the closed euclidean ball of radius
1, let B′ be an open ball containing Bl, and H : ∆ × B′ → ∆ × Rl be a slice topological
embedding. For any ε > 0, there exists a slice smooth embedding ˜H : ∆ × Bl ֒→ ∆ × Rl with
dC0(H|Bl×∆, ˜H) < ε.

29

We should emphasize that we present only a formal proof, based on [KS77]. Theorem
A.1 will be deduced from the concordance implies isotopy theorems, as they are stated in
[KS77, Essay I,II]. Before we get into the proof, we should introduce some vocabulary and
notation. A topological manifold W being given, we deﬁne the following:

• A diﬀerentiable structure γ on W is an equivalence class of smooth atlases of W .

• A concordance between diﬀerentiable structures γ0, γ1 on W is a diﬀerentiable struc-
ture Γ on [0, 1] × W whose restriction to {0} × W and {1} × W are γ0, γ1 respectively.

A.1 The absolute case

We consider here the non-parametric case - ∆ = {∗}, and prove a preliminary approximation
result.

Proposition A.2. Let l ≥ 5 and h : Rl → Rl be a compactly supported homeomor-
phism. For any ε > 0, there exists a compactly supported diﬀeomorphism ˜h : Rl ֒→ Rl
with dC0(h, ˜h) < ε.

Proof:

Deﬁne

Φ : Rl × [0, 1] −→ Rl × [0, 1]
t ), t),

7−→ (th( x

(x, t)

and let Γ be the smooth structure on Rl × [0, 1] obtained by pulling-back the standard
smooth structure Γst by Φ, γ0 := Γ|Rl×{0} and γ1 := Γ|Rl×{1}. Then,

(i) γ0 = γst on Rl, since Φ|Rl×{0} = Id ,

(ii) h : (Rl, γst) → (Rl, γ1) is a diﬀeomorphism,

(iii) Γ is a concordance between γ0 = γst and γ1.

By the concordance implies isotopy theorem [KS77, Essay I, p.3], there exists a diﬀeo-
morphism Θ : (Rl × [0, 1], Γ) → (Rl × [0, 1], Γst = γst × [0, 1]), with dC0(Θ, Id ) < ε, and
Θ|Rl×{0} = Id . In particular, θ := ΘRl×{1} is a diﬀeomorphism between (Rl, γ1) and (Rl, γst)
with dC0(θ, Id ) < ε. Thus, θ ◦ h : Rl → Rl is a diﬀeomorphism, and dC0(θ ◦ h, h) < ε. Hence
˜h := θ ◦ h is a desired approximation.
(cid:3)

A.2 Proof of theorem A.1

Let H : B′ × ∆ → Rl × ∆ be a slice topological embedding, with l ≥ 6, where ∆ is a
ball, 0 ∈ ∆ (so that 0 is a topological retract of ∆). Denote by Ht := H|B′×{t}, seen as a
topological embedding B′ → Rl.

30

By Kirby’s Annulus Theorem, H0|Bl extends to a compactly supported homeomorphism

ˆH0 : Rl → Rl [Kir69]. Denote by δ the modulus of continuity of ˆH0, deﬁned by

δ(ε) := max{δ | d(x, y) < δ =⇒ d( ˆH0(x), ˆH0(y)) < ε}

(since ˆH0 is compactly supported in Rl, δ(ε) > 0). By proposition A.2, there exists an
ε/2-approximation ˜h of ˆH0, which is a compactly supported homomorphism of Rl. We have
dC0(˜h, ˆH0) < ε/2. Deﬁne now Φ : Bl × ∆ → Rl × ∆, Φ(t, x) := (t, ˆH −1
0 ◦ Ht(x)), which is
a slice embedding with Φ0 = Id . By [KS77, Essay II, theorem 2.7], there exists a smooth,
slice embedding ˜Φ : Bl ×∆ → Rl ×∆ with dC0( ˜Φ, Φ) < δ(ε/2), ˜Φ0 = Id . The slice embedding
˜H(t, x) := (t, ˜h ◦ ˜Φt(x)) veriﬁes dC0( ˜H, H) = max{dC0( ˜Ht, Ht), t ∈ [0, 1]}, and :

dC0( ˜Ht, Ht) = dC0(˜h ◦ ˜Φt, ˆH0 ◦ Φt)

≤ dC0(˜h ◦ ˜Φt, ˆH0 ◦ ˜Φt) + dC0( ˆH0 ◦ ˜Φt, ˆH0 ◦ Φt)
< ε/2 + ε/2 = ε

(notice that ˜Φ is a δ(ε/2)-approximation of Φ, so the last inequality holds by deﬁnition of
the modulus of continuity).
(cid:3)

B The Lagrangian Camel theorem: Viterbo’s approach. By

Jaime Bustillo.

We provide here a proof of theorem 4.2 which depends on Viterbo’s spectral invariants,
hence on generating functions instead of holomorphic curves. In fact, the Lagrangian Camel
theorem that we prove in this section is slightly weaker than theorem 4.2.

Theorem B.1. Let L := S1(a)m × Rn−m ⊂ Cm × Cn−m be a standard Lagrangian tube.
Assume that there is a compactly supported Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism ψ of Cn such that
ψ(L) ∩ (Cm × iRn−m) ⊂ Z(A) × iRn−m. Then, a 6 A.

This theorem is however enough to prove theorem 3. Indeed, section 4.3 shows that
the symplectic embedding f : P m(a′) × Rn−m ֒→ Cn provided by lemma 4.1 is in fact
the image of the standard P m(a′) × Rn−m ⊂ Cn by a compactly supported Hamiltonian
diﬀeomorphism. And the proof of theorem 3 modulo lemma 4.1 and theorem 4.2 - provided
in section 4.1 - is also a proof modulo this strenghtened version of lemma 4.1 and weakened
version of theorem 4.2.

B.1 Generating functions and spectral invariants.

The classical setting. To a compactly supported Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism ψ of R2n
one associates a Lagrangian submanifold Lψ ⊂ T ∗S2n in the following way. The graph

to the diagonal ∆ := {(x, x); x ∈ R2n} ⊂ R2n × R2n. Identifying R2n × R2n and T ∗R2n via
the symplectic isomorphism

and noting that Γ(ψ) and ∆ coincide at inﬁnity, we can produce a compact version of the
Lagrangian submanifold Γ(ψ) ⊂ R2n × R2n, which is a Lagrangian sphere Lψ ⊂ T ∗S2n. This
Lagrangian submanifold Lψ is Hamiltonian isotopic to the 0-section and coincides with it
on a neighborhood of the north pole, so it has a generating function quadratic at inﬁnity
(called g.f.q.i. in the following) by [LS85]. This is a function S : S2n × RN → R which
coincides with a quadratic form Q : RN → R at inﬁnity:

∃C > 0 | S(x, ξ) = Q(ξ) ∀x ∈ S2n, |ξ| > C,

and such that

Lψ =n(x,

∂S

), (x, ξ) ∈ S2n × RN ,

∂S
∂ξ

(x, ξ) = 0o ⊂ T ∗S2n.

with 0 being a regular value of (x, ξ) 7→ ∂S
∂ξ (x, ξ). A direct consequence of the deﬁnition
is that ΣS := {(x, ξ) | ∂S
∂ξ (x, ξ) = 0} is a submanifold and that the map iS : ΣS → T ∗S2n
given by (x, ξ) 7→ (x, ∂S
∂x (x, ξ)) is an immersion. When S is a g.f.q.i. that generates an
embedded submanifold one can prove that iS is a diﬀeomorphism between ΣS and Lψ,
so every S has a unique critical point associated to (N, 0) given by i−1
S (N, 0). Denote by
T −1
Eλ := {S ≤ λ}, iλ : (Eλ, E−∞) ֒→ (E+∞, E−∞), H ∗(E+∞, E−∞)
≃ H ∗(S2n) (T is the
Thom isomorphism). One can select some spectral values c(α, S) for α ∈ H ∗(S2n) by:

c(α, S) := inf{λ | i∗

λ(T α) 6= 0}.

Although the g.f.q.i. associated to ψ is not unique, there is a natural normalization (re-
quiring that S(i−1
S (N, 0)) = 0) that ensures that the value c(α, S) does not depend on the
g.f.q.i. , so we denote it henceforth c(α, ψ) [Vit92, Th´e99a]. It is a symplectic invariant in
the sense that if Φ ∈ Symp(R2n) then c(α, Φ ◦ ψ ◦ Φ−1) = c(α, ψ). Taking for α generators 1
and µ of H 0(S2n) and H 2n(S2n) respectively, we therefore get two spectral invariants c(1, ψ)
and c(µ, ψ) of Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphisms, and a spectral norm γ(ψ) := c(µ, ψ) − c(1, ψ).
These invariants can be used in turn to deﬁne symplectic invariants of subsets of R2n:

c(X) = inf{c(U ), U open, X ⊂ U },

c(U ) = sup{c(µ, ψ), ψ ∈ Hamc(U )}

(2.1.1)

γ(X) = sup{γ(Y ), Y ⊂ X, Y ⋐ R2n},

γ(Y ) = inf{γ(ψ), ψ ∈ Hamc(R2n), ψ(Y )∩Y = ∅}.

The reductive setting [Vit92, §5]. Let us ﬁrst state a general result for the spectral
invariants of the reduction of some Lagrangian submanifolds. This is proposition 5.1 in
[Vit92]. We include a proof for the sake of completeness.

Proposition B.2. Let N and B be two connected compact manifolds, S a g.f.q.i. for a
Lagrangian submanifold in T ∗(N × B), b a point in B and Sb := S(·, b, ·). Let α ∈ H ∗(N )
and µB ∈ H ∗(B) the orientation class of B. Then,

c(α ⊗ 1, S) ≤ c(α, Sb) ≤ c(α ⊗ µB, S).

Moreover, if ˜K(x, b, ξ) = K(x, ξ) for all (x, b, ξ) ∈ N × B × RN , c(α ⊗ 1, ˜K) = c(α, K) =
c(α ⊗ µB, ˜K).

Proof: Let as before Eλ := {S 6 λ}, and Eλ

b := {Sb 6 λ}. Consider the commutative

where the map H ∗(N × B) → H ∗(N ) is induced by the injection N → N × {b} → N × B,
and coincides with the composition of the projection on H ∗(N ) ⊗ H 0(B) and the obvious
identiﬁcation H ∗(N ) ⊗ H 0(B) → H ∗(N ). Since the diagram is commutative, i∗
λT (α) 6= 0
implies i∗
λT (α ⊗ 1) 6= 0, so c(α ⊗ 1, S) ≤ c(α, Sb). To get the second inequality, we need
to introduce spectral invariants deﬁned via homology. The Thom isomorphism is now
T : H∗(S2n)

∼→ H∗(E+∞, E−∞), and

c(A, S) = inf{λ | T A ∈ Im (iλ∗)}.

The homological and cohomological invariants are related by c(α, S) = −c(PD(α), −S)
[Vit92, Proposition 2.7]. In the homology setting, the commutative diagram becomes

As before, if A ∈ H∗(N ) veriﬁes T (A) ∈ Im (iλ∗), then T (A⊗[b]) ∈ Im (iλ∗), so c(A⊗[b], S) 6
c(A, Sb) for all A ∈ H∗(N ) (and all S). Thus,

c(α, Sb) = −c(PD(α), −Sb) 6 −c(PD(α) ⊗ [b], −S) = −c(PD(α ⊗ µB), −S) = c(α ⊗ µB, S).

Finally, if ˜K(x, b, ξ) = K(x, ξ) for all (x, b, ξ) ∈ N × B × RN then Eλ = Eλ

Remark B.3. To understand the context of the previous statement, notice that when a
Lagrangian submanifold L ⊂ T ∗N × T ∗B has a g.f.q.i. S, and has transverse intersection
with a ﬁber T ∗N × T ∗
b B for some b ∈ B, the function Sb is a g.f.q.i. for the reduction Lb
of L ∩ T ∗N × T ∗

Following [Vit92, §5], we work on R2m×T ∗Tk ≃ R2m×Rk×Tk endowed with coordinates
(z, p, q). Let π : R2m×Rk×Rk → R2m×Rk×Tk be the projection and consider a Hamiltonian
diﬀeomorphism ψ ∈ Hamc(R2m × T ∗Tk) with coordinates (ψz, ψp, ψq) generated by Ht. It
is easy to see that Ht ◦ π generates a lift ˜ψ ∈ Ham(R2m × Rk × Rk) such that

˜ψz(z, p, ˜q + 1) = ˜ψz(z, p, ˜q) = ψz(z, p, q)
˜ψp(z, p, ˜q + 1) = ˜ψp(z, p, ˜q) = ψp(z, p, q)
˜ψ˜q(z, p, ˜q + 1) = ˜ψ˜q(z, p, ˜q) + 1

(with (z, p, q) = π(z, p, ˜q))



Again, the graph of ˜ψ is a Lagrangian submanifold Γ( ˜ψ) ⊂ R2m × R2k × R2m × R2k that
under I becomes a Lagrangian submanifold of T ∗R2m × T ∗R2k parametrized by

Γ ˜ψ(z, p, ˜q) =(cid:0)I(z, ψz(z, p, q)),

p + ψp(z, p, q)

˜q + ˜ψ˜q(z, p, ˜q)

,

, ˜q − ˜ψ˜q(z, p, ˜q), ψp(z, p, q) − p(cid:1).

Now ˜ψ˜q(z, p, ˜q + 1) = ˜ψ˜q(z, p, ˜q) + 1 implies that Γ ˜ψ descends to an embedding ˜Γψ : R2m ×
Rk × Tk → T ∗R2m × T ∗Rk × T ∗Tk, given by

˜Γψ(z, p, q) =(cid:0)I(z, ψz),

p + ψp

2

, q − ψq,

q + ψq

2

, ψp − p(cid:1).

This embedding ˜Γψ is Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero-section, and coincides with the zero-
section at inﬁnity. As in the classical situation, ˜Γ(ψ) := Im ˜Γψ can be compactiﬁed to a
Lagrangian submanifold

Lψ ⊂ T ∗(S2m × Sk × Tk),

which is Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero-section, and coincides with the zero-section on
a neighbourhood of {N } × Sk × Tk and of S2m × {N } × Tk. After normalization (by
S(i−1
S (N, N, 0, 0)) = 0), the g.f.q.i. of Lψ provides spectral invariants c(α ⊗ β ⊗ γ, ψ) for
α ∈ H ∗(S2m), β ∈ H ∗(Sk) and γ ∈ H ∗(Tk). As in (2.1.1 ), these invariants can be used to
deﬁne c(α ⊗ β ⊗ γ, X), for subsets X ⊂ R2m × T ∗Tk.

Proposition B.4. If X is a compact subset of R2m then c(X) ≤ c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, X × {0} × Tk).

Proof: Let U be a bounded neighbourhood of X, ϕ ∈ Hamc(U ). By deﬁnition of the spectral
capacities c, it is enough to ﬁnd, for any neighbourhood V of 0 in Rk, a Ψ ∈ Hamc(U ×V ×Tk)
such that c(µ, ϕ) 6 c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, Ψ).

Let H : R × R2m → R be a generator of ϕ, and χ ∈ C ∞

c (V) with χ(0) = 1 and
∂χ
∂p (0) = 0. The Hamiltonian χH of R2m × Rk × Tk generates a compactly supported
Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism that we will note Ψ = (ψz, ψp, ψq). It is easy to see that

Ψ(z, p, q) = (ψz(z, p), p, q + C(z, p))

with C(z, p) =R 1

0

ΓΨ : R2m × Rk × Tk → T ∗R2m × T ∗Rk × T ∗Tk it thus given by

∂χ
∂p (p)H(t, z)dt, and that C(z, 0) = 0 and ψz(z, 0) = ϕ(z). The embedding

˜ΓΨ(z, p, q) = (I(z, ψz(z, p)), p, −C(z, p), q +

1
2

C(z, p), 0).

34

By deﬁnition, when we compactify Im ˜ΓΨ we get LΨ which, by the previous expression, is
easily seen to be transverse to T ∗S2m × T0Sk × T ∗Tk. Now

˜ΓΨ(z, 0, q) = (I(z, ϕ(z)), 0, 0, q, 0).

so LΨ ∩ T ∗S2m × T0Sk × T ∗Tk = Lϕ × {(0, 0)} × 0Tk and the reduction is Lϕ × 0Tk which
is also Hamiltonian isotopic to the zero-section. Therefore, by remark B.3, if S is a g.f.q.i.
for LΨ, S0 is a g.f.q.i. for Lϕ × 0Tk . On the other hand, if K is a g.f.q.i. for Lϕ then
˜K(z, q, ξ) = K(z, ξ) is also a g.f.q.i. for Lϕ × 0Tk . Moreover, both S0 and ˜K have 0 as the
critical value associated to {N } × {q}, so by uniqueness of g.f.q.i. c(µ ⊗ 1, ˜K) = c(µ ⊗ 1, S0).
By proposition B.2,

c(µ, K) = c(µ ⊗ 1, ˜K) = c(µ ⊗ 1, S0) ≤ c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, S),

which precisely means that c(µ, ϕ) ≤ c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, Ψ).

(cid:3)

The next proposition is taken from [Vit92, proposition 5.2]. Since the proof is a bit ellip-
tical, (it refers to the proofs of several other propositions of the same paper) we give more
indications in section B.3 below.

Proposition B.5. Consider a compact set Z ⊂ R2m × Rk × Tk, a point w ∈ Tk and the
reduction Zw := (Z ∩ {q = w})/Rk. Then

c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, Z) ≤ γ(Zw).

B.2 Non-squeezing in a reductive setting

Together, propositions B.4 and B.5 provide the non-squeezing statement we are looking for.

Theorem B.6. Let X be a compact set and consider X × Rn−m ⊂ Cm × Cn−m. Assume
that there is a compactly supported Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism ψ of Cn such that ψ(X ×
Rn−m) ∩ (Cm × iRn−m) ⊂ Z × iRn−m. Then c(X) ≤ γ(Z).

Proof: Since ψ has compact support, we can view it as a symplectomorphism of Cm ×
T ∗Tn−m ≃ R2m × Rn−m × Tn−m.
In this setting X × Rn−m is X × {0} × Tn−m and
ψ(X × {0} × Tn−m) ∩ {q = 0} ⊂ Z × Rn−m × {0} so ψ(X × {0} × Tn−m)0 ⊂ Z. Now
applying proposition B.4, invariance, proposition B.5 and monotonicity we get the chain of
inequalities:

c(X) ≤ c(µ⊗µ⊗1, X×{0}×Tk) = c(µ⊗µ⊗1, ψ(X×{0}×Tk)) ≤ γ(ψ(X×{0}×Tk)0) ≤ γ(Z).(cid:3)

Corollary B.7 (Lagrangian Camel theorem). Let L := S1(a)m × Rn−m ⊂ Cm × Cn−m
be a standard Lagrangian tube. Assume that there is a compactly supported Hamiltonian
diﬀeomorphism ψ of Cn such that ψ(L) ∩ (Cm × iRn−m) ⊂ Z(A) × iRn−m where Z(A) is a
symplectic cylinder of capacity A. Then a ≤ A.

Proof: By theorem B.6, c(S1(a)m) 6 γ(Z(A)) = A, and c(S1(a)m) = a by [Th´e99b, remark
1.5].
(cid:3)

B.3 Proof of proposition B.5.

Let Z ⊂ R2m×Rk ×Tk and Zw :=(cid:0)Z ∩{q = w}(cid:1)/Rk. We need to show that c(µ⊗µ⊗1, Z) 6

γ(Zw). Let V ⊂ R2m be an arbitrary neighbourhood of Zw, and

U := (R2m × Rk × Tk \ {w}) ∪ (V × Rk × Tk).

Obviously, Z ⊂ U and Uw = V , so by monotonicity of c, it is enough to prove that
c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, U ) 6 γ(Uw). Notice moreover that any Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism of R2m
that displaces V = Uw also displaces its ﬁlling ˜Uw := R2m\F ∞
w is the unbounded
connected component of R2m\Uw. Thus γ(Uw) = γ( ˜Uw), so we may as well assume that
R2m\Uw is connected and unbounded, which we do henceforth. Let ψ ∈ Hamc(U ) and
ϕ ∈ Hamc(Cm) be such that ϕ(Uw) ∩ Uw = ∅. We need to prove that

w , where F ∞

c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, ψ) ≤ γ(ϕ).

We know that the Lagrangian submanifold Lϕ in T ∗S2m is isotopic to the zero section by
a Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism Φ and has a g.f.q.i. K : S2m × Rd → R. This diﬀeomorphism
Φ induces a Hamiltonian diﬀeomorphism ˜Φ := Φ × Id on T ∗S2m × T ∗Sk that veriﬁes
˜Φ(0) = Lϕ × 0 and ˜K(x, y, η) := K(x, η) (deﬁned on S2m × Sk × Rd) is a g.f.q.i. for this
submanifold. Now for a g.f.q.i. S of Lψ we have

c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, ψ) = c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, S) 6 c(µ ⊗ µ, Sw) 6 c(µ ⊗ µ, Sw − ˜K) − c(1 ⊗ 1, − ˜K).

The ﬁrst inequality above follows from proposition B.2, while the second one is the triangle
inequality for spectral invariants [Vit92, proposition 3.3] (because (µ ⊗ µ) ∪ (1 ⊗ 1) = µ ⊗ µ).
The following lemmas ensure that c(µ⊗µ, Sw − ˜K) = c(µ⊗µ, − ˜K), so (applying proposition
B.2):

c(µ ⊗ µ ⊗ 1, ψ) 6 c(µ ⊗ µ, − ˜K) − c(1 ⊗ 1, − ˜K) = c(µ, −K) − c(1, −K) = γ(ϕ−1) = γ(ϕ),

which is the desired inequality.

Consider a Hamiltonian path ψt from the identity to ψ in Hamc(U ) and a Hamiltonian
path Ψt of T ∗S2m × T ∗Sk × T ∗Tk such that Ψt(0) = Lψt. This path gives rise to a family
of g.f.q.i. St, continuous in t, that generate Lψt for all t and that coincide with a ﬁxed
quadratic form Q outside a compact set independent of t [LS85]. The ﬁrst lemma ensures
that we can further assume St normalized.

Lemma B.8. Gt := St − c(µ ⊗ 1 ⊗ γ, St) is a continuous family of normalized generating
functions for Lψt. Moreover there exists a family of ﬁber preserving diﬀeomorphisms ϕt
such that Gt ◦ ϕt is a continuous family of normalized g.f.q.i. for Lψt.

N (z, q, ξ) = St(z, N, q, ξ)
Proof: To start with, we know that St
generate the zero sections so they have just one critical value. Since St(i−1
St (N, N, q, 0)) is
a common critical value we ﬁnd that they are both the same. Using proposition B.2 we

N (p, q, ξ) = St(N, p, q, ξ) and St

36

get c(1 ⊗ γ, St
determines continuously the critical value at inﬁnity.

N ) ≤ c(µ ⊗ 1 ⊗ γ, St) ≤ c(µ ⊗ γ, St

N ) so c(µ ⊗ 1 ⊗ γ, St) = St(i−1

St (N, N, q, 0))

For the second part, deﬁne ct := c(µ ⊗ 1 ⊗ γ, St) and recall that St equals Q outside
a compact set. Let χ : RN → [0, 1] be a compactly supported function with χ ≡ 1 in a
~∇Q(ξ)
neighbourhood of 0, and Xt(ξ) := (1 − χ(ξ))ct
k ~∇Q(ξ)k2 , seen as an autonomous vector ﬁeld
(t is not the parameter of integration). This vector ﬁeld Xt is well-deﬁned and complete
because Q is non-degenerate, so ϕt := Φ1
is well-deﬁned. Moreover, if ξ lies far away in
Xt
RN , Φr
(ξ) = Q(ξ) + rct.
Xt
As a consequence, (Q − ct) ◦ ϕt = Q outside a compact set, so Gt ◦ ϕt := Gt(z, p, q, ϕt(ξ))
is a g.f.q.i. for Lψt. Since moreover Gt is normalized, so is Gt ◦ ϕt. Finally, the family ϕt
is obviously continuous in the t variable.
(cid:3)

(ξ) remains on the set {1 − χ = 1} for all r ∈ [0, 1], so Q ◦ Φr

Lemma B.9. Let St be a continuous family of normalized g.f.q.i. for Lψt. Then c(µ ⊗
w − ˜K) is a critical value of − ˜K and as a consequence c(µ ⊗ µ, Sw − ˜K) = c(µ ⊗ µ, − ˜K).

notation St
to prove that all critical points (z, p, ξ, η) of St
of − ˜K, while (z, p, ξ) is a critical point of St
a critical point veriﬁes

w. Recall that the
w − ˜K stands for the function (z, p, ξ, η) 7→ St(z, p, w, ξ) − K(z, η). It is enough
w − ˜K are such that (z, η) is a critical point
w with critical value 0. Letting x := (z, p), such

∂St

so it is associated to an intersection point of Lt

w and Lϕ × 0 in the ﬁber of (z, p). This

q − ψt

and

q + ψt

q = w),

or will be on the zero section coming from critical points of St at inﬁnity. We claim that such
a point of intersection must lie on I(Uw ×Uw)c ×T ∗Sk. Indeed, if I(Uw ×Uw)×T ∗Sk ∩(Lϕ ×
0) 6= ∅, then Φ−1(I(Uw × Uw)) ∩ 0 6= ∅. But Φ−1(I(Uw × Uw)) = I(ϕ−1(Uw) × Uw) does not
intersect the zero section because ϕ displaces Uw. This in turn implies that the intersection
z) ∈ (Uw × Uw)c
point is in the zero section: if a point of Lt

w is in I(Uw × Uw)c × T ∗Sk, (z, ψt

37

z /∈ Uw. In both cases, ψt(z, p, w) = (z, p, w) because q = ψt

so z /∈ Uw or ψt
q = w, and ψt
has support in U , which intersects {q = w} along Uw × Rk. Thus, the point ˜Γψt (z, p, w) is
on the zero section, (z, p, w, ξ) is indeed a critical point of St and as a consequence (z, η) is
a critical point of − ˜K. In addition (z, p, w) is in U c because z /∈ Uw.

Now we prove that all the points in U c have critical value 0. Since Supp ψt ⋐ U and U c
is connected, there is an open connected set W that contains U c and that does not intersect
Supp ψt (for all t). Then 0W ⊂ Lt so if j : W ֒→ Lt is the inclusion on the zero section,
f := i−1
St ◦ j : W → ΣSt is an embedding into the set of critical points. The open set W is
connected so St ◦ f is constant and all the points in W have the same critical value. The
fact that St is normalized now implies that this value is zero.

Finally, Sard’s theorem ensures that the set of critical values of − ˜K has measure zero,
w − ˜K) is therefore
(cid:3)

so it is totally disconnected. By continuity of the invariants, c(µ ⊗ µ, St
constant, so c(µ ⊗ µ, − ˜K) = c(µ ⊗ µ, S1

w − ˜K).
