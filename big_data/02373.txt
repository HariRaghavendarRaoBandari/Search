Abstract—The ﬁnite-set statistics (FISST) approach to multi-
target tracking—random ﬁnite sets (RFS’s), belief-mass func-
tions, and set derivatives—was introduced in the mid-1990s.
Its current extended form—probability generating functionals
(p.g.fl.’s) and functional derivatives—dates from 2001. In 2008,
an “elementary” alternative to FISST was proposed, based on
“ﬁnite point processes” rather than RFS’s. This was accom-
panied by single-sensor and multisensor versions of a claimed
generalization of the PHD ﬁlter, the “multitarget intensity ﬁlter”
or “iFilter.” Then in 2013 in the Journal of Advances in
Information Fusion (JAIF) and elsewhere, the same author went
on to claim that the FISST p.g.fl./functional derivative approach
is actually “due to” (a “corollary” of) a 50-year-old pure-
mathematics paper by Moyal; and described a “point process”
p.g.fl./functional derivative approach to multitarget
tracking
supposedly based on it.
In this paper it is shown that: (1)
non-RFS point processes are a phenomenologically erroneous
foundation for multitarget tracking; (2) nearly every equation,
concept, discussion, derivation, and methodology in the JAIF
paper originally appeared in FISST publications, without being
so attributed; (3) FISST cannot possibly be “due to Moyal”;
and (4) the “point process” approach described in JAIF differs
from FISST only in regard to terminology and notation, and
thus in this sense appears to be an obscured, phenomenologically
erroneous, and improperly attributed copy of FISST. The paper
concludes with the following question: Given the above, do the
peer-review standards of the Journal of Advances in Information
Fusion rise to the level expected of any credible scientiﬁc journal?
It is also shown that the derivations of the single-sensor and
multisensor iFilter appear to have had major errors, as did
a subsequent recasting of the multisensor iFilter as a “trafﬁc
mapping ﬁlter.”

I. INTRODUCTION

The ﬁnite-set statistics (FISST) approach to multitarget
tracking and information fusion—random ﬁnite sets (RFS’s),
belief-mass functions, and set derivatives—was introduced in
the mid-1990s [8].
Its current extended form—probability
generating functionals (p.g.fl.’s) and functional derivatives—
dates from 2001 [23]. It was ﬁrst systematically described in
2007 in the book [26]. See [28] for a tutorial introduction.

Since 2007,

the approach has inspired a considerable
amount of research, conducted by many dozens of researchers
in at
least 19 nations, reported in well over a thousand
publications. As a result, progress has been rapid and has
proceeded in diverse and sometimes unexpected directions,
propelled by many clever new ideas.

These include algorithms for: simultaneous multitarget
tracking and sensor registration; multitarget tracking and com-
prehensive clutter estimation in unknown, dynamic clutter;
provably Bayes-optimal and tractable exact closed-form mul-
titarget tracking; uniﬁed multitarget track-to-track fusion in
ad hoc sensor networks; and uniﬁed, provably Bayes-optimal
“hard + soft” information fusion.

In addition, FISST-based algorithms have been shown
to signiﬁcantly outperform traditional methods,
including:
single-target
track-before-detect
(TBD) in pixelized images; simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) in robotics; and multitarget tracking using
superpositional sensors.

tracking in heavy clutter;

See [15] for a short survey of these advances, or [13] for

detailed coverage of most of them.

The purpose of this paper is to address the following
issues—and, in the process, correct many scientiﬁc miscon-
ceptions.
In 2008 in [50] and [45], a claimed alternative to
FISST was proposed, which was (1) based on “ﬁnite point
processes” rather than RFS’s; and (2) “elementary” because
(unlike the FISST p.g.fl./ functional derivative approach) it
required only “familiarity with single target Bayesian ﬁltering
and with PPP’s [Poisson point processes] at an elementary
level.” In particular, a claim was made for an “elementary”
derivation of the probability hypothesis density (PHD) ﬁlter.
Also proposed were single-sensor [50] and multisensor [45]
versions of a claimed generalization of the PHD ﬁlter, the
“multitarget intensity ﬁlter” (later renamed “iFilter”).

At the time, the “point process” approach was celebrated by
some because it seemed to offer an “elementary” alternative
to FISST. Given this, one might have expected to see
concrete evidence justifying such expectations—for example,
an “elementary” derivation of the cardinalized PHD (CPHD)
ﬁlter, or a CPHD generalization of the iFilter. However, no
such work seems to have appeared.

In 2012 [47] and 2013 [43], [48], [2], the author of [50],
[45] appeared to abandon the “elementary” approach in favor
of the FISST p.g.fl./ functional derivative approach. He did
so, however—and most notably in the Journal of Advances
in Information Fusion paper [48]—by claiming that FISST
is actually “due to” (a “corollary” of) a 50-year-old pure-
mathematics paper [33] by Moyal. Then—allegedly directly
applying Moyal’s paper (substituted in place of its mere
“corollary,” FISST)—he outlined an alleged “point process”
formulation of the p.g.fl./functional derivative approach; and
used it to produce allegedly new p.g.fl./functional derivative
derivations of the PHD ﬁlter and iFilter [48]. In 2013, he and
two co-authors [2] employed this formulation, while citing
[48] rather than FISST as its source.

This history is recounted in greater detail in Section IV.
Given that the “elementary” approach sufﬁced (“multitarget
intensity ﬁlters can be understood in essentially elementary
terms” [50, p. 1]), the need for either Moyal’s paper or such
rederivations is not altogether clear.

Be this as it may, when distilled to their essence the claims

in [50], [45], [48], [2] appear to be as follows:

1) 2008: Mahler’s p.g.fl./functional derivative approach

to multitarget tracking is unnecessary because “single
target Bayesian ﬁltering and with PPP’s at an elementary
level” sufﬁce.

2) 2012-2013: Mahler’s p.g.fl./functional derivative ap-
proach to multitarget tracking is necessary, but is ac-
tually “due to Moyal” rather than Mahler.

Strong scientiﬁc claims such as these require strong sci-
entiﬁc scrutiny. This paper will investigate their validity in a
systematic and detailed manner, hopefully clarifying a number
of technical issues about “ﬁnite point processes” along the
way. The following major points will be demonstrated:

1) Section III: A non-RFS point process is—unlike an
RFS–a phenomenologically erroneous model of a mul-
titarget system. Moreover, any point process becomes
an RFS when it
is applied to practical multitarget
tracking. Therefore, the “point process” approach in
[50], [45] differed from the FISST RFS approach only in
terminology and notation and thus, in this sense, appears
to have been an obscured and erroneous copy of it.

2) Sections V, VIII: The Journal of Advances in Informa-
tion Fusion paper [48] was accepted, and is being cited,
as original research. Yet nearly every equation, concept,
discussion, derivation, and methodology in it appeared
earlier in the FISST publications [3], [22], [23], [24],
[25], [26], [27]—but without being so attributed. A few
examples (to be discussed in more detail shortly):

a) Section V-A: FISST notation and terminology was
systematically changed without attribution. For
example, the FISST “cardinality distribution” was
changed to “cardinal number density” in [46, p.
45] and then to “canonical number distribution” in
[48, p. 128].

b) Section V-B: In [48], the “point process” derivation
of a central FISST equation (the p.g.fl. version of
Bayes’ rule, [26, Eq. (G.427)]) was (except for
notation) identical to the 2007 FISST derivation
in [26, Eqs. (G.428-G.438)]—but without being so
attributed. Yet, in [48] the original FISST equation
[26, Eq. (G.427)] was claimed to be a mere special
case of this identical “point process” copy.

c) Sections V-B through V-F: In [48], the “point pro-
cess” approach for applying p.g.fl.’s and functional
derivatives to multitarget tracking was (except for
terminology and notation) identical to the FISST
approach, without being so attributed.

d) Section V-F:

In particular, the “point process”
derivation of the PHD ﬁlter in [48] was (except for
terminology and notation) identical to the FISST
derivation described in 2004 in [25], without being
so attributed.
It was also a special case of the
FISST derivations of the CPHD ﬁlter in [24] and
the “general PHD ﬁlter” in [3]. The corresponding
“point process” rederivation of the iFilter in [48]
employed the same basic FISST derivation, without
being so acknowledged.

no practical applications at all, and which appeared at
the same time as the Kalman ﬁlter and nearly 20 years
In particular:
before Reid’s seminal MHT paper, [36].
a) Sections IX-C, IX-D: The FISST p.g.fl./functional
derivative approach is neither “due to Moyal” nor
“has exactly the same meaning” as in [33]—
because it cannot be found anywhere in [33].

b) Section IX-B5, IX-C: FISST allows one to ex-
plicitly construct concrete formulas for the density
functions of RFS’s (as is required for practical
application), using Volterra’s concept of the func-
tional derivative of a p.g.fl.

c) Section IX-A2: But the paper [33] merely deﬁned
abstract multivariate measures in terms of Gˆateaux
derivatives of p.g.fl.’s, with no means of construct-
ing their density functions. Neither functional
derivatives nor the term “functional derivative”
appear anywhere in [33].

d) Section VI-D: Reverse-engineering is fundamen-
tally different than engineering. It is easy to know
the right things to do—and even easier to claim
that these things are actually obvious—if someone
else has previously shown you how to do it all in
complete detail.

4) Sections X, XI: The derivations of both the single- and
multisensor iFilters in [50], [45] had major mathematical
errors; and the key concept underlying the iFilter appears
to be phenomenologically questionable. Moreover, the
PHD ﬁlter is not a special case of the iFilter; and the
multisensor iFilter appears to have demonstrably poorer
performance than the RFS alternatives.

5) Sections XI-E, XI-F, XI-G: A subsequent recasting [46]
of the multisensor iFilter, as a “multisensor trafﬁc map-
ping ﬁlter,” also appears to have had major mathematical
and conceptual errors.

The paper begins with a short refresher on proper scientiﬁc
discourse (Section II) and ends with a summary and conclu-
sions (Section VII) in which the following question is posed:
• Do the peer-review standards of the Journal of Advances
in Information Fusion rise to the level expected of any
credible scientiﬁc journal?

To achieve a more streamlined exposition, four systematic
supporting analyses have been placed as Appendices:
a
comparison of the contents of the Journal of Advances in
Information Fusion paper [48] with earlier FISST publications
(Section VIII); a comparison of FISST with Moyal’s paper
[33] (Section IX); the iFilter (Section X); and the multisensor
iFilter (Section XI).

II. PREAMBLE: ON SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE

It is necessary to begin with the following reminders:
1) Scientiﬁc critique is essential

to scientiﬁc discourse.
Technical error can seriously undermine a scientiﬁc
discipline if it is propagated unnoticed and unremarked.1

3) Sections VI, IX: It is impossible for the FISST approach
to multitarget tracking to be “due to,” or a mere “corol-

1For an instructive cautionary tale, see K. Kelley and C. Moody, “The

booms and busts of molecular electronics,” IEEE Spectrum, Oct. 2015.

2) A scientiﬁcally valid but critical argument is still a
scientiﬁcally valid argument. In particular, any factually
true statement is a scientiﬁcally valid statement.

3) To accuse the author of a scientiﬁc critique of being “un-
professional,” simply because s/he has written a critique,
is itself unprofessional. The proper scientiﬁc response to
open scientiﬁc critique is more open scientiﬁc critique—
not ad hominem attacks.

III. RFS’S VS. “POINT PROCESSES”

In this section, the RFS and “point process” formulations
of multitarget tracking theory are summarized (Section III-A).
The latter is shown to be, for purposes of practical multitarget
tracking, mathematically identical
to the RFS formulation
(Section III-B); (2) phenomenologically erroneous in general
(Section III-C); and (3) not theoretically general enough to
address “hard + soft” fusion (Section III-D).

A. The “point process” formulation

As previously noted, in 2008 in [50] and [45], an allegedly
new approach to multitarget tracking was proposed, based on
“ﬁnite point processes.”
In particular, in [50], Kingman’s
well-known book Poisson Processes [11] was cited as an
authoritative text on point processes.2

However, Kingman employed an RFS formulation of point
process theory.3 That is, let X be a target state space. Then
a point process in X is a random variable whose realizations
are ﬁnite sets—that is, unordered lists {x1, ..., xn} such that
x1, ..., xn ∈ X and n ≥ 0, and {x1, ..., xi, ..., xj, ..., xn} =
{x1, ..., xi, ..., xn} if xi = xj.

Despite Kingman’s RFS formulation, in [50] the realizations
of a “point process” were deﬁned in non-RFS terms—that is,
as vectors (n, x1, ..., xn) or, alternatively, (n, {x1, ..., xn})
for any n ≥ 0—where (at variance with standard modern
notation) {x1, ..., xn}
here denotes a ﬁnite unordered list
rather than a ﬁnite set.4

B. RFS’s vs. “point processes” in practical tracking, 1

is the multiplicity of xi
The number ni of copies of xi
in (n, {x1, ..., xn}).
for
every realization, then the point process is simple. Since an
ﬁnite unordered list with distinct elements is the same thing
as a ﬁnite set, a simple point process is an RFS.

If ni = 1 for any i = 1, ..., n,

To be of practical use,

the probability density function
(p.d.f.) f (n, {x1, ..., xn}) of a point process must exist—
i.e., be ﬁnite-valued. However, a basic result of point process
theory is the following. Let X = L×S (S ⊆ RN , L ﬁnite).
Then the p.d.f. exists only if the point process is simple—i.e.,
only if it is an RFS ([4], p. 134, Prop. 5.4.IV). That is:

2To wit:

“For further background on PPP’s from a multidimensional

perspective, see Kingman [6]”—[50], ﬁrst paragraph of Section 2.

• When a point process is applied to practical multitarget

tracking, it becomes an RFS.

• Consequently, any claimed “point process” alternative
to the FISST RFS formulation differs from it only in
terminology and notation, and so is in this sense an
obscured copy of it.

C. RFS’s vs. “point processes” in practical tracking, 2

In practical multitarget tracking, a target-state must have
the form x = (ℓ, u), where u is the kinematic state and
is a unique track-label—for example, ℓ = ‘Bob’. As a
ℓ
consequence, any realization (n, x1, ..., xn) of a point process
that is not a ﬁnite set cannot correctly model the state of a
multitarget system. This is because

(n, x1, ..., (Bob, u), ..., (Bob, u), ..., xn)

indicates that there are two or more copies of ‘Bob’ in the
scene—a physical impossibility. That is:

• A non-RFS point process is a phenomenologically invalid

model of a random multitarget state.

• Consequently, RFS theory (and not general point process
theory) is the theoretically correct foundation for practi-
cal multitarget tracking.

• Therefore, any “point process” alternative to the RFS

formulation is, in this sense, an erroneous copy of it.

Thus when it is stated that “Mahler...refers to ﬁnite point
processes as random ﬁnite sets...” [43, p. 2], it appears that
the reverse is true. In [43] and elsewhere, it is RFS’s that are
being misleadingly referred to as “ﬁnite point processes.”

D. RFS’s vs. “point processes” in information fusion

In addition, FISST is central for the provably Bayes-optimal
uniﬁcation of “hard + soft” information fusion—see Chapter
22 of [13]. Since this uniﬁcation requires general random
closed sets and not just random ﬁnite sets, “point processes”
are not theoretically general enough to address such issues.

IV. FISST IS “DUE TO MOYAL”

The history of “point process” claims about FISST was
sketched in the Introduction. The purpose of this section is
to recount those claims in greater detail.

In 2012, in a tutorial [47, p. 87] at the International Confer-
ence on Information Fusion in Singapore, it was claimed that
a central equation of the FISST p.g.fl./functional derivative
approach—the p.g.fl. version of Bayes’ rule (see Eq. (4)
or Eq. (64))—is a mere “corollary” of a 50-year-old pure-
mathematics paper [33] by Moyal.5

In 2013, this claim was expanded in a paper at the Workshop

on Sensor Data Fusion in Bonn, Germany [43, p. 2]:

• “Mahler’s tracking contributions are [limited to] the use
of the PGFL to derive the Bayes posterior process and the
repeated use of the summary statistic called the intensity
(or, equivalently, the PHD) to approximate the Bayes

posterior point process and thereby close the Bayesian
recursion.”

Given that (1) Mahler’s only “tracking contributions” are the
PHD ﬁlter and the application of the p.g.fl. Bayes’ rule to it,
but (2) the p.g.fl. Bayes’ rule itself is merely a “corollary” of
Moyal’s paper [33], it follows that the PHD ﬁlter is Mahler’s
only signiﬁcant “tracking contribution.”
In particular, the
FISST p.g.fl./multitarget calculus, and the methodologies for
applying it to multitarget tracking, are not.

This thesis was elaborated at length in 2013 in a paper [48]
published in the Journal of Advances in Information Fusion
(JAIF):6 There it was claimed that:

• “The ﬁnite-set statistics (FISST) concerns functional dif-
ferentiation of PGFLs, where functional differentiation
has exactly the same meaning as in the calculus of
variations” [48, p. 121]—where in this respect the paper
[33] by Moyal was cited.

• The functional calculus used in FISST is “due to Moyal”

[48, p. 121] (and thus, by implication, not to Mahler).

As previously noted, what followed was a p.g.fl./functional
calculus approach to multitarget tracking, allegedly based on
Moyal’s paper [33] (substituted in place of its mere “corollary,”
FISST); and it was employed to produce allegedly new “point
process” p.g.fl./functional derivative derivations of the PHD
ﬁlter and iFilter. Furthermore, the p.g.fl. Bayes’ rule was now
claimed to be a signiﬁcant new result, original with the same
author who had previously characterized it [47, p. 87] as a
mere “corollary” of Moyal’s paper (see Section V-B).

A sequel [2] presented at the 2013 International Conference
on Information Fusion in Istanbul, Turkey, cited the yet-
to-be-published [48], rather than FISST, as the source of
the p.g.fl./functional derivative approach employed in it.
In
particular, its authors explicitly cited (see [2, Eq. (28)]) the
“point process” derivation of the PHD ﬁlter in [48, Eqs.
(42-52)] rather than any FISST derivation—despite the fact
that (see Section V-F) the “point process” derivation was
mathematically identical to the FISST derivation described in
[25] as well as a special case of the FISST derivations of the
CPHD ﬁlter in [24] and the “general PHD ﬁlter” in [3].

V. A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF [48]

The Journal of Advances in Information Fusion paper [48]
was accepted, and is being cited, as original research. The
purpose of this section is to demonstrate that nearly every
equation, concept, discussion, derivation, and methodology in
it appeared earlier (in all cases but one, at least ﬁve years
earlier) in the FISST publications [3], [22], [23], [24], [25],
[26], [27]—but without being so attributed. As per the claims
made in [47, p. 87] and [43, p. 2], its only explicit reference
to FISST was in regard to the PHD ﬁlter [48, p. 120] (this
being, after all, Mahler’s only actual “tracking contribution”).
[48, Eqs. (1-17,18-22)] were claimed to be “due to Moyal,”7

6Statements of fact: JAIF is the house journal of the International Society
of Information Fusion (ISIF)—the organization of which the author of [48]
was President when it was submitted for publication.

7To wit:

“The results presented in this section [Section 3] are due to

4

even though [48, Eqs. (6-10,12-17,22)] cannot be found in
[33]—but did appear in earlier FISST publications.

An equation-by-equation demonstration of these claims can
be found in Section VIII. What follows is an examination of
some of the more obvious instances:

1) “Point process” notation/terminology (Section V-A).
2) “Point process” derivation of the p.g.fl. Bayes’ rule

(Section V-B). This is of special signiﬁcance.

3) “Point process” z-transforms (Section V-C).
4) “Point process” state estimators (Section V-D).
5) “Branching processes” (Section V-E).
6) “Point process” derivation methodology (Section V-F).
7) Other issues (Section V-G).

A. “Point process” notation and terminology

In [48], well-known FISST terminology was systematically

changed, usually without attribution. A few examples:

1) “random ﬁnite set”—changed to “ﬁnite point process,”8
even though (as was shown in Sections III-B and III-C),
a “ﬁnite point process” is actually an RFS when applied
to practical multitarget tracking.

2) set-theoretic union of RFS’s—changed to “superposi-

tion” of “point processes.”

3) “probability hypothesis density (PHD)”—changed to
“intensity function”9
(even though the terminology
“PHD” is a historical10 and widely accepted usage in
multitarget tracking).

4) “cardinality distribution”—changed to “cardinal number
density”11 in [46, p. 45] and subsequently to “canonical
number distribution” in [48, p. 128].

Also in [48], well-known FISST notation was systematically

changed, without attribution. A few typical examples:

1) The FISST Ξk+1|k (random target state-set) and Σk+1

(random measurement-set)—changed to Ξ, Υ.

2) The FISST (n!)−1 · fΞ({x1, ..., xn})—changed to

pΞ
N X (n, x1, ..., xn) = pΞ

N (n) pΞ

X|N (x1, ..., xn|n).

(1)

3) The FISST multitarget likelihood function

fk(Z|X)
and multitarget posterior distribution fk|k(X|Z (k)) at
time tk—changed to

pΥ|Ξ(m, y1, ..., ym|n, x1, ..., xn)
pΞ|Υ(n, x1, ..., xn|m, y1, ..., ym).

4) The FISST notation

fk+1(Z|X) · fk+1|k(X) =
fk+1(Z, X), for the joint probability distribution of
Σk+1 and Ξk+1|k—changed to

M N (m, n) pΞ
pΥΞ
M Y N X (m, y1, ..., ym, n, s1, ..., sn).

Y X|M N (y1, ..., ym, s1, ..., sn|m, n)

8To wit: “Mahler...refers to ﬁnite point processes as random ﬁnite sets...”

[43, p. 2]

9To wit: “In tracking applications, [the intensity function] is sometimes
called the probability hypothesis density (PHD)” (emphasis added) [49, p. 5].
10The terminology “probability hypothesis density” was coined by Stein

and Winter, not Mahler—see [22].

11This terminology is inappropriate because,

in mathematics,

the term

Moyal” [48, p. 120]

“density” is reserved for continuously inﬁnite spaces.

5) The FISST p.g.fl.’s Fk+1[g, h], Gk+1|k+1[h], and
Gk+1[g|X]—changed to GΥΞ[g, h], GΞ|Υ[h], and
GΥ|Ξ[g|s1, ..., sn].

6) The FISST notation R fΞ(X)δX for a set integral of

f (X)—changed to

pΞ
N X(n, s1, ..., sn)ds1 · · · dsn.

(3)

7) The FISST notation hX for the power functional—

∞

Xn=0ZSn
changed to Qn

j=1 h(sj).

5

2) Given this, it is unclear how Eq. (4) could be asserted
to be a mere “specialized version” of Eq. (6). Eq.
(4) was derived in “[10,p.757]” as a general theorem
of probability, and the allegedly fully general “point
process” derivation in [48, Eqs. (23-27)] is identical to it.
A general theorem of probability does not become less
general because it is subsequently applied to multitarget
tracking.12

3) It is equally unclear how Eq. (6) could be claimed as a
signiﬁcant original contribution in [48] given that, earlier
in [47, p. 87], this same equation had been characterized
by the same author as a mere “corollary” of Moyal’s
theoretically general paper [33].

B. “Point process” derivation of p.g.fl. Bayes’ rule

Special attention should be paid to this section. The FISST
p.g.fl. version of Bayes’ rule was derived in Eqs. (G.428-
G.438) on p. 757 of [26] and is [26, Eq. (G.427)]:

where [26, Eqs. (G.428,G.429)]

is the joint p.g.fl. of the joint distribution fk|k−1(Z, X) =
fk(Z|X) · fk|k−1(X).

An alleged “point process” derivation of Eq. (4) was pre-
sented in [48, Eqs. (23-27)], leading to a “point process”
version of Eq. (4) [48, Eq. (28)]:

GΥ|Ξ[h|y1, ..., ym] =

• Eq. (6) is “valid for general point processes...[whereas
a]...specialized version...for multitarget tracking applica-
tions is derived in [10,p.757], where it is described as the
PGFL ‘form of the multitarget corrector’” [48, p. 124]
and is “speciﬁc to the tracking application” [48, p. 2].

Here, “[10,p.757]” refers to p. 757 of the 2007 FISST

textbook [26], where Eq. (4) was derived.

The following should be pointed out:
1) The “point process” derivation [48, Eqs.

(23-27)]
was (except for notation and terminology) identical
to the FISST derivation [26, Eqs. (G.428-G.438)] in
“[10,p.757]”—but not so attributed. For example, Eq.
(7) is identical to Eq. (5)—but not so attributed.

(4)

In [48, p. 123] the following was stated:
• “In the signal processing literature, F Ξ(z−1) is called
N (n) :

the z-transform of the sequence of probabilities pΞ
n = 0, 1, ...”

(5)

Notation aside, this is an abbreviated version of the FISST
discussions in [26, pp. 343-344, 372]—but not so attributed.

D. “Point process” multitarget state estimators

In [48, Eq. (32)], a Bayes-optimal multitarget state estimator
was deﬁned to minimize the posterior multitarget Bayes risk:

ˆξBayes = arg min
ζ∈E(S)

R(ζ).

(8)

Notation and terminology aside, this discussion is identical to
the FISST discussions in [8, pp. 189-190], [22, p. 1159, Sec.
II-B.7], and [26, p. 63]—but not so attributed. The rigorous
deﬁnition of Bayes-optimal multitarget state estimators was
original with FISST—see [13, pp. 110-111].

In particular, in [48, Eq. (32)] the following is claimed:
• “The MAP estimate is undeﬁned for the posterior pdf
pΞ|Υ(ξ|υ). To see this, it is only necessary to observe
that pΞ|Υ(ξ1|υ) and pΞ|Υ(ξ2|υ) have different units
when the realizations ξ1 and ξ2 have different numbers
of points.”

Notation and terminology aside,

this is identical to the
FISST discussions in [8, pp. 189-190], [26, pp. 494-495], [27,
p. 59], and [22, p. 1159, Sec. II-B.7]—but not so attributed.
The failure of the classical state estimators in the multitarget
It was
case was an early FISST insight [21, pp. 299-300].
by no means obvious at the time—consider, for example,
the following doubly erroneous statement by Stone et al. in
1999 [41, pp. 162-163]: “The [multitarget] posterior distri-
bution...represents our knowledge of the number of targets
present and their state...From this...we can compute point
estimates...such as maximum a posteriori probability estimates
or means” (emphasis added).

12Does Eq. (6 ) itself become “speciﬁc to the tracking application” because

it is subsquently so applied?

E. “Branching processes”

In [48, Eqs. (37,38)], Eq. (7) is rewritten in “branching
to

process form,” which in turn is described as “central
multitarget tracking applications”:

GΥΞ[g, h] = GΞ[hT [g|·]]

(9)

where T [g|s] = GΥ[g|s]
is the p.g.fl. of the measurement
process for a target with state s. Except for notation, Eq. (9)
is identical to the no-clutter special case of the FISST equation
[3, Eq. (68,71)],

Fk+1[g, h] = κk+1[g] · Gk+1|k[h · Tk+1[g]],

(10)
but is not so attributed.13 Moreover, the equations [48, Eqs.
(34,35)] used to derive it are identical to to the FISST [24,
Eqs. (45,44)]—or, alternatively, to the ﬁfth and sixth equations
from top in the second column of the FISST [22, p. 1173].

An allegedly original “point process,” p.g.fl./functional cal-
culus derivation of the measurement-update for the PHD ﬁlter
was described in [48, Eqs. (42-52)].
It was then modiﬁed
(i.e., PHD ﬁlter state-transition model replaced by the inter-
mixing model of Section X-C) to produce a “point process,”
p.g.fl./functional calculus derivation of the iFilter.

However, it is demonstrated in this section that the “point
process” PHD ﬁlter derivation was, without being so at-
tributed: (1) identical to the one described in 2004 in [25]; (2)
the Poisson (PHD ﬁlter) special case of the 2007 derivation
of the CPHD ﬁlter in [24]; and (3) a special case of the 2012
derivation of the “general PHD ﬁlter” in [3].

The “point process” derivation in [48, Eqs. (42-52)] begins
with the formula for the p.g.fl. for the measurement process
of a system of targets with states s1, ..., sn [48, Eq. (42)]:

n

GΥ|Ξ[g|s1, ..., sn] = GΨclutter[g]

GΥtarget [g|si]

(11)

where the “PGFL of target-originated measurements” [48, Eq.
(43)] for a target with state s is:

GΥtarget [g|s] = 1 − pD(s) + pD(s)ZY

g(y)p(y|s)dy.

(12)

Eqs. (11,12) were asserted without proof. However, they are
due to the FISST RFS measurement modeling methodology
(see Section IX-B3), without being so attributed. Notation
aside, Eq. (11) is identical to the second equation from the
bottom in the second column of p. 1173 in the FISST [22]:

Gk+1[g|X] = G[g|x1] · · · G[g|xn] · GΘ[g]

(13)

where GΘ[g]
the FISST [3, Eq. (68)]:

is the p.g.fl. of the clutter process; and also to

Gk+1[g|X] = κk+1[g] · Tk+1[g]X .

(14)

Likewise, Eq. (12) is identical to the third equation from
bottom in the second column of p. 1173 in the FISST [22]:

G[g|x] = 1 − pD(x) + pD(x) pg(x)

Eq. (6)—the “point process” copy of the FISST p.g.fl.
Bayes’ rule, Eq. (4)—is then applied. First, the functional

[g, h] = Fk+1[g, h]Yz∈Z(cid:0)λc(z) + Dk+1|k[hpDLz](cid:1) .

It is also the Poisson (PHD ﬁlter) special case of the FISST

The following is then used to derive the PHD ﬁlter
measurement-update equation—see Eq. (76)—from Eq. (21)
[48, Eq. (29)]:

f Υ|Ξ(x) =

where pg(x) =R g(z) · fk+1(z|x)dz.

From this point on in [48], the FISST derivation method-
ology (see Section IX-B6)—and, in particular, the speciﬁc
FISST derivation decribed in 2004 in [25, Eqs. (20,21)]—is
employed without attribution. To wit:

In [48, Eq. (46)], Eqs. (11,12) are used to derive a formula

for the joint p.g.fl.:
GΥΞ[g, h]

−RS h(s)pD(s)f Ξ(s)ds

+RSRY g(y)h(s)p(y|s)P D(s)f Ξ(s)dyds

Notation aside, this is identical to the seventh equation from
the top in the ﬁrst column of p. 1174 in the FISST [22]:

F [g, h] = exp (λc[g] − λ + µs[hqD] + µs[hpDpg] − µ)

s[hqD] = Z h(x)(1 − pD(x))s(x)dx
s[hqD] = Z h(x)pD(x)pg(x)s(x)dx
pg(x) = Z g(z)fk+1(z|x)dz.

The numerator of Eq. (24) is computed in [48, Eq. (49)]. As
was noted in 2004 in the FISST [25, Eq. (22)], this follows
easily from Eq. (25) and Eq. (33) below—without being so
attributed.
It is also the Poisson (PHD ﬁlter) special case of
the FISST [24, Eq. (139)]—but not so attributed.

G. Other issues

This section addresses erroneous claims that were made
in [48] regarding (1) the origin of p.g.fl.’s (Section V-G1);
(2) formulas for the posterior p.g.f. (Section V-G2); (3) a
“point process” formula for the p.g.f. corresponding to the
PHD ﬁlter (Section V-G3); and (4) a statement about “ﬁnite
point process” state models (Section V-G4).

1) The origin of p.g.fl.’s : In [48, p. 119] it is stated that:
• “PGFLs for ﬁnite point processes were introduced in

1962 by Moyal.”

False.

In the introduction of his paper, Moyal clearly
stated that “...generating functionals were introduced in this
connection [point process theory] by Kendall [9] and Bartlett
and Kendall [3]...” [33, p. 2]—citing papers published by those
authors in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
(See also [33],
footnote 1 on p. 13.) Daley and Vere-Jones attribute the
ﬁrst use of the p.g.fl. to Bogoliubov in 1946 [5, p. 15].14
In addition, the p.g.fl. was a point process application of
Volterra’s “functional power series” concept, which dates from
the late 1920’s [51, p. 21].

2) The “canonical number distribution” : Following [48,

Eq. (21)] it is stated that:
• “The probability pΞ

N (n)

[“canonical number distribu-
times the integral of the ordered pdf

tion”] is n!
pΞ(n, x1, ..., xn) over all x1, ..., xn.” That is:

pΞ

N (n) = n!Z pΞ(n, x1, ..., xn)dx1 · · · dxn.

(26)

(27)

False.

For,

pΞ
N (n)

is the marginal distribution of

pΞ(n, x1, ..., xn) after integrating out x1, ..., xn:

pΞ

N (n) = Z pΞ(n, x1, ..., xn)dx1 · · · dxn

=

1

n!Z pΞ(n, {x1, ..., xn})dx1 · · · dxn (28)

where Eq. (28) follows from [48, Eq. (15)]. Eq. (26) is
an erroneous version of the FISST integral formula for the
cardinality distribution, [24, Eq. (6)] or [26, Eq. (11.115)]:

pΞ(n) =

1

n!Z fΞ({x1, ..., xn})dx1 · · · dxn.

(29)

A related error is the following formula for the “posterior

pdf of the canonical number”15 [48, Eq. (31)]:

pΞ|Υ
N (n) =

1
n!

dn
dxn F Ξ|Υ[0].

(30)

14Statement of fact: The author of [48] was aware of Daley & Vere-
Jones’ attribution, since I quoted it to him during his tutorial [47] at the 2012
International Conference on Information Fusion.

15It is inappropriate to call pΞ|Υ

N (n) a “pdf” since, in standard mathe-

matical usage, this terminology is reserved for continuous spaces.

7

Since F Ξ|Υ[0]
is a constant, its n’th derivative is 0 and so
pΞ|Υ
N (n) = 0 for n > 0.16 Eq. (30) is an erroneous version
of the FISST [24, Eq. (168)]:

pk+1|k+1(n) =

1
n!

G(n)

k+1|k+1(0).

(31)

3) A “point process” p.g.f. formula : In [48, Eq. (54)], it is
stated that the following formula (for the posterior probability
generating function (p.g.f.)), “appears to be new to the PHD
literature”:

F Ξ|Υ
PHD (x)

(32)

.

= exp(cid:20)(x − 1)ZS

(1 − P D(s)f Ξ(s)ds(cid:21)
λ(yi) + xRS p(yi|s)P D(s)f Ξ(s)ds
λ(yi) +RS p(yi|s)P D(s)f Ξ(s)ds

Yi=1

In 2004 in [25, Eq. (21)], the posterior p.g.fl. for the

PHD ﬁlter was identiﬁed as:

Gk+1|k+1[h] = eDk+1|k[(h−1)(1−pD)]

(33)

λc(z) + Dk+1|k[hpDLz]
λc(z) + Dk+1|k[pDLz]

.

· Yz∈Z

Eq. (32) trivially follows from the substitution h = x. Eq.
(32) is also the Poisson (PHD ﬁlter) special case of the well-
known FISST formula for the posterior p.g.f. of the CPHD
ﬁlter [24, Eq. (61)], [26, Eq. (16.326)].

4) “Finite point process” state models : In [48, p. 130] the

following is stated:

• “Finite point process models...are only approximate mod-
els for multitarget state. Accepting the point process
model for the multitarget state as a given, the PHD ﬁlter
and iFilter are good applications...”

False, in multiple respects. First, an RFS Ξ ⊆ X is
an exact model of the random multitarget state. Second, the
statement appears to repeat a common misconception: that the
Poisson (PHD ﬁlter) approximation of Ξ is “the” unique RFS
“model” of the random multitarget state. Not only is Ξ the
actual RFS model, there is a progression of successively more
accurate approximations of Ξ:
the i.i.d.c. approximation (for
CPHD ﬁlters), the multi-Bernoulli approximation (for multi-
Bernoulli ﬁlters), and the generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli
(GLMB) approximation (for GLMB ﬁlters). See [28] for a
tutorial summary or [13] for deep detail.

Third, and as was noted in Section III-C, a non-RFS “ﬁnite
point process” is a phenomenologically erroneous model of the
random multitarget state. Thus the very phrase “ﬁnite point
process models for multitarget state” is misleading at best and
an oxymoron at the worst.

VI. REVERSE-ENGINEERING VS. ENGINEERING

In Section V (and as documented in equation-by-equation
detail in Section VIII), it was shown that the selection of equa-
tions, concepts, discussions, derivations, and methodologies
chosen in [48] is a subset of FISST’s—while not being so
attributed.

In Section IX, it is demonstrated that:

16The same error occurs in [48, Eq. (36)].

1) Sections IX-C, IX-D:

The alleged “point process”
p.g.fl./functional calculus approach in [48] is neither
“due to Moyal” nor “has exactly the same meaning” as
in [33]—because it cannot be found anywhere in [33].
It is, however, identical to the heuristic
version of the p.g.fl./functional derivative approach used
in FISST—but without being so attributed.

2) Section IX-C:

The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that the FISST
p.g.fl./functional calculus could not be “due to Moyal” even
if it could be found in [33].

Let us begin with an example.

In Section V-G1 it was
pointed out that Bartlett’s and Kendall’s p.g.fl. was an adapta-
tion of Volterra’s “functional power series” (f.p.s.) [51, p. 21].
Could we—in imitation of the “point process” insinuations of
[47, p. 87], [43, p. 2], [48]—claim that the p.g.fl. is actually
“due to Volterra”—a mere “corollary” of [51]? And that we
could thereby bypass Bartlett and Kendall by purporting a
p.g.fl. theory based only on [51]? Clearly we could not.
Bartlett and Kendall devised a novel application of the f.p.s. to
point process theory—an application Volterra could not have
even known about. Only perfect hindsight would allow us
to retroactively declare the f.p.s. to be the ﬁrst p.g.fl. This
observation leads us to the following point:

• The contents of the JAIF paper [48] can be portrayed
as obvious implications or applications of Moyal’s paper
[33] only with the beneﬁt of perfect hindsight gained
from pre-existing knowledge of FISST—i.e., only with
recourse to reverse engineering.

Three speciﬁc instances of such hindsight will be examined
as case studies:
the p.g.fl. (Section VI-A), the functional
derivative (Section VI-B), and the FISST derivation method-
ologies (Section VI-C).

Consider the following analogy:

the reverse-engineering
of an electronic device. Any particular component of the
device might be easily found in one of any number of
parts catalogues. Unacknowledged reverse-engineering has
occurred if one:
(1) copies the parts list, (2) copies the
schematic for assembling the parts into a functional device, (3)
builds the device according that schematic; and (4) portrays
the resulting device as either original or obvious.

In like manner, thousands of equations, concepts, discus-
sions, and methodologies (the “parts”) can be found in various
publications in the point process literature (the “catalogues”).
None of these publications addressed multitarget detection and
tracking prior to the appearance of FISST.

A. The p.g.fl.

the p.g.fl. and c.fl. are not

Moyal mentioned two point process “generating function-
the p.g.fl. and the characteristic functional (c.fl.).
als”:
However,
the only possible
generating functionals. Daley and Vere-Jones [4] describe
many others, including the factorial moment-generating func-
tional (f.m.g.fl.), the factorial cumulant generating functional
(f.c.g.fl.), and the Laplace functional (L.fl.).

The p.g.fl. is not specially privileged—different purposes
require different generating functionals. Snyder and Miller
[40] apply point process theory to imaging applications. They

8

employ only the c.fl.—the p.g.fl. is never even mentioned. The
well-known textbook [10] by Karr employs only the L.fl.—
and, once again, the p.g.fl. is never mentioned.

Out of all of the generating functionals, in [48] it was the
p.g.fl. that was selected as the proper choice for multitarget
tracking. This insight could not be “due to Moyal” since
Moyal’s paper did not address even Bayes ﬁltering, let alone
multitarget tracking.
It is the case, however, that when [48]
was submitted for publication the p.g.fl. had been a prominent
“part” in the FISST “parts list” for over a decade—see [23],
[22], [24], [26], and Section IX-B4.

B. The functional derivative

Given the p.g.fl., there are many possible functional calculi
from which one can choose: Gˆateaux differentials, chain dif-
ferentials, Gˆateaux derivatives, Hadamard derivatives, Frech´et
derivatives, functional derivatives, etc.

Out of all of the possible calculi, in [48] it was the heuristic
functional derivative—see Section IX-C—that was selected as
the proper choice for multitarget tracking. This insight could
not be “due to Moyal,” since neither the functional derivative
(heuristic or otherwise) nor the term “functional derivative”
can be found in Moyal’s paper—see Sections IX-A2 and IX-D.
Indeed, Moyal employed Gˆateaux derivatives, not functional
derivatives—see Section IX-A2.
It is the case, however, that
when [48] was submitted for publication both the functional
derivative and its heuristic version had been prominent “parts”
in the FISST “parts list” for over a decade—see [23], [22],
[24], [26], and Section IX-B5.

C. The FISST derivation methodologies

Given the p.g.fl. and functional derivative, one also needs
systematic methodologies for successfully applying them to
multitarget tracking. Out
the thousands of point process
concepts and methodologies available in point process “cat-
alogues,” it was the concepts of the FISST derivation method-
ology of Section IX-B6 that were selected in [48] as the proper
choice for multitarget tracking (Section V-F).
In addition, in
[48] the end-results of the FISST modeling methodology of
Section IX-B3 were assumed without attribution.

None of these could be obvious extrapolations of Moyal’s
paper to multitarget tracking, given that it appeared at the
same time as the Kalman ﬁlter and nearly 20 years before
Reid’s seminal MHT paper, [36].
It is the case, however,
that when [48] was submitted for publication these concepts
and methodologies had been highly visible components of the
FISST “schematic” for over a decade—see [23], [22], [24],
[26], and Sections IX-B3 and IX-B6.

D. Reverse-engineering

As was noted in the Introduction:
• Reverse-engineering is fundamentally different than en-
gineering.
It is easy to know the right things to do
(e.g., to know what “parts” to look for in point process
“catalogues”)—and even easier to claim that these things
are actually obvious—if someone else has shown you
how to do it all (i.e., has speciﬁed the “parts list” and
the “schematic”) in complete detail.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper the following claims were demonstrated:
1) The “point process” alternative to the FISST RFS for-
mulation of multitarget tracking, originally described in
2008 in [50], [45], appears to have been an obscured
and phenomenologically erroneous copy of the RFS
approach (Section III). Moreover, [50], [45] appear
to have had major mathematical and conceptual errors
(Sections X, XI).

2) The 2013 Journal of Advances in Information Fusion
(JAIF) paper [48] was accepted, and is being cited, as
original research. Yet nearly every equation, concept,
discussion, derivation, and methodology in it ﬁrst ap-
peared in earlier FISST publications—but without being
so attributed (Sections V, VIII).

3) In particular, in [48] it was claimed that a central FISST
formula, the p.g.fl. version of Bayes’ rule, is a mere
special case of an alleged “point process” version of
that same formula—even though the derivation of the
“point process” formula was mathematically identical
to the FISST derivation of the original FISST formula,
without being so attributed (Section V-B).

4) The contents of the JAIF paper [48] can be portrayed as
obvious implications or applications of the paper [33]
by Moyal only with the beneﬁt of perfect hindsight
gained from pre-existing knowledge of the FISST “parts
list” and “schematic”—i.e., only with recourse to reverse
engineering (Section VI).

5) Consequently,

the “point process” p.g.fl./functional
derivative approach to multitarget tracking described
in [48] and subsequently in [2] appears to be an ob-
scured, phenomenologically erroneous, and improperly
attributed copy of FISST.

Given these facts, the following question seems reasonable:
• Do the peer-review standards of the Journal of Advances
in Information Fusion rise to the level expected of any
scientiﬁcally credible journal?

It seems otherwise.

It is unclear how, in any competent
review, the errors identiﬁed in Section V-G could have been
overlooked. The one in V-G4 was obvious; those in Eqs.
(26,30) were glaring; and the one in Section V-G3 should
have been blinding to anyone who actually examined Moyal’s
paper. It is unclear how other facts could have evaded notice:
that almost the entirety of [48] had previously appeared in
FISST publications; that this went unacknowledged in [48];
and that FISST could not possibly be “due to Moyal.”

One explanation: JAIF does not require reviewers to be
in a paper’s subject, but merely “respected scien-
expert
tists/mathematicians.”17 Thus:
eminences who know little
about FISST are, regardless, JAIF-qualiﬁed to review papers
about FISST. This elevation of uninformed eminence over
actual expertise suggests a deep misunderstanding at JAIF
of what proper scientiﬁc peer review is all about. The
substitution of an appearance of scientiﬁc rigor in place of
the reality seems almost guaranteed to proliferate scientiﬁc

misconception and error, or worse—and not just in regard to
“ﬁnite point processes” vis-a-vis multitarget tracking.

VIII. APPENDIX: CONTENT ANALYSIS OF [48]

Here it is demonstrated that nearly all of the equations,
concepts, discussions, derivations, and methodologies in the
Journal of Advances in Information Fusion paper [48] are,
except for notation and terminology, identical to those in the
earlier FISST publications [8], [23], [27], [22], [25, Sec. 3.4],
[24], [26], and [3].18 The phrase “is identical to” is shorthand
for “is identical to except for notation and terminology.”

1) [48, Eq. (1)]: identical to [22, Eq. (44)] or [24, Eq. (15)]

or [26, Eq. (11.154)].

2) [48, Eq. (2)]:

identical to the result in [22, p. 1165,
Prop. 5c] or to the ﬁfth equation from the top in the
ﬁrst column of [22, p. 1174].

identical to [22, Eq. (47)] or [3, Eq. (3)].

3) [48, Eq. (3)]:

IX. APPENDIX: FISST VS. MOYAL

In this section it will be demonstrated that:
1) The alleged “point process” p.g.fl./functional calculus
approach in [48] is neither “due to Moyal” nor “has
exactly the same meaning” as in [33]—because it cannot
be found anywhere in [33].

2) It is, however, identical to the heuristic version of the
p.g.fl./functional derivative approach used in FISST—
but without being so attributed.

The section is organized as follows: a summary of Moyal’s
functional calculus (Section IX-A); a summary of the FISST
calculus and methodologies (Section IX-B); heuristic func-
tional derivatives (Section IX-C); and a discussion of “secular
functions” (Section IX-D).

A. Summary of Moyal’s calculus

In [33, p. 2-3], Moyal formulated three versions of point
process theory and showed them to be equivalent. For our
purposes we need only consider one of them, which was
discussed in Section III-A. The statistics of a point process P
are speciﬁed by its probability measure P (O) = Pr(P ∈ O)
where O is a measurable subset of the space X of
all ﬁnite unordered lists22 {x1, ..., xn}
of arbitrary length
n ≥ 0 [33, Eq. (2.5)]. The measure P
induces, and is
completely determined by, symmetric multivariate measures
P (n)(S1, ..., Sn) for all measurable S1, ..., Sn ⊆ X (known
in modern parlance as “Janossy measures” [4]).

1) Measure-theoretic p.g.fl.’s : Let h(·) be a bounded,
complex-valued integrable function with norm [33, Eq. (4.1)]

khk = sup
x∈X

|h(x)|.

(34)

Then the p.g.fl. of P is ([33, Eq. (4.11)] with k = 0):

G[h] =

h(x1) · · · h(xn) · P (n)(dx1 · · · dxn)

(35)

∞

Xn=0ZXn

where the integrals are taken with respect to the measures
P (n)(S1, ..., Sn), and where the summation converges for
those h such that G[khk] < ∞.

2) Gˆateaux differentials and derivatives : Moyal employs

the “n -th order variation” [33, Eq. (4.11)]

δn

w1,...,wnG[h] ="

∂n

∂ε1 · · · ∂εn

G"h +

n

Xi=1

εiwi##ε1=...=εn=0

(36)
where w1(x), ..., wn(x) are bounded, complex-valued func-
tions. The ﬁrst-order variation is, therefore,

δwG[h] = (cid:20) d

dε

= lim
ε→0

G [h + εw](cid:21)ε=0

G [h + εw] − G [h]

ε

.

(37)

(38)

In the modern mathematical literature, Eq. (38) is known as a
Gˆateaux differential, and is not speciﬁc to functionals.

If

δwG[h]

is linear and continuous in w,

then δwG[h]
is known as the Gˆateaux derivative of G[h] at h and is
often denoted as (DhG)[w]

[7].

Now suppose that the p.g.fl. G[h] of P is known. Then
the multivariate measures of P can be recovered via iterated
Gˆateaux differentials [33, Eq. (4.14)]:

P (n)(S1, ..., Sn) =

1
n!

· δn

1S1 ,...,1Sn

G[0]

(39)

where 1S(x) denotes the indicator function of S ⊆ X.
(Since the left side is presumed to be a measure, Moyal
implicitly assumes that the right side is an iterated Gˆateaux
derivative.) The multivariate factorial moment measures of P
can similarly be recovered as [33, Eq. (4.16)]:

M(n)(S1, ..., Sn) = δn

1S1 ,...,1Sn

G[1].

(40)

22Moyal used the notation {x1, ..., xn} to denote a ﬁnite unordered list,

not (as is now standard practice) a ﬁnite set.

11

In particular, the ﬁrst factorial moment measure—i.e., the
measure corresponding to the PHD if the PHD exists—is:

M(1)(S) = δ1S G[1].

(41)

Moyal does not provide or suggest any methodology for
deriving concrete formulas even for his multivariate measures
in Eqs. (39-41)—let alone for their corresponding density
functions (as would be required for application). A less
abstract and more practically useful approach is required.
FISST was speciﬁcally designed to be such an approach.

B. Summary of FISST

This section is organized as follows: belief measures (Sec-
tion IX-B1); set derivatives (Section IX-B2); RFS motion and
measurement modeling(Section IX-B3); the FISST approach
to p.g.fl.’s (Section IX-B4); functional derivatives (Section
IX-B5); the FISST derivation methodology (Section IX-B6);
and heuristic functional derivatives (Section IX-C).

1) Belief measures : As was noted in Sections III-B and
III-C, when applied to practical multitarget tracking: (1) a
“point process” is the same thing as an RFS and (2) a non-RFS
“point process” is phenomenologically erroneous. Moyal’s
measure-theoretic framework is therefore an unnecessary ob-
fuscation and so FISST employs RFS’s from the very outset.
If Ξ is an RFS then the Janossy measures P (n)(S1, ..., Sn)
have Janossy densities

pn(x1, ..., xn) =

1
n!

· fΞ({x1, ..., xn}),

(42)

where
probability density function.

fΞ(X)

is the FISST notation for a multitarget

Moreover, FISST speciﬁcally avoids more complicated for-
mulations of RFS theory by adopting the stochastic geometry
formulation [42].
In this case the statistics of Ξ are
characterized by its belief measure [26, pp. 711-716]:

βΞ(S) = Pr(Ξ ⊆ S),

(43)

which is not only far more physically intuitive than Moyal’s
measures {P (n)(S1, ..., Sn)}∞
n=0, but also allows direct set-
theoretic access to the RFS Ξ.

2) Set derivatives : Moreover, the Janossy densities can be
constructed from βΞ(S). Deﬁne the ﬁrst-order set derivative
of βΞ(S) at the point x ∈ X to be [8, pp. 144-151], [26,
pp. 380-381], [28, Eqs. (54,55)]

Given this, fΞ(X) can be computed as a set derivative:

fΞ(X) =

(46)

Similarly,
M(n)(S1, ..., Sn)
as set derivatives of belief measures:

can be computed directly

and M(1)(S)

MΞ(X) =

δβΞ

DΞ(x) =

(X).

(47)

3) RFS modeling methodology : Belief measures and set
derivatives form the basis of a rigorous, systematic methodol-
ogy for multitarget motion and measurement modeling.

The simplest RFS motion model has the form

n′ ) ∪ Bk|k−1

Ξk|k−1 = Tk|k−1(x′
1..., x′

1) ∪ ... ∪ Tk|k−1(x′
n′ } with |X ′| = n′

where X ′ = {x′
is the multitarget
state-set at time tk−1; where Tk|k−1(x′) is the RFS model
of the survival or disappearance of a target with state x′ at
time tk−1; Bk|k−1
is the RFS model for newly-appearing
targets; and Ξk|k−1 is the predicted multitarget state-set.

(48)

Likewise, the simplest RFS measurement model is

Σk|k = Υk(x1) ∪ ... ∪ Υk(xn) ∪ Ck

(49)

|X| = n is the multi-
where X = {x1..., xn} with
target state-set at time
is the random
measurement-set generated by a target with state x at time
tk; Ck|k−1
is the RFS modeling the clutter process at time
tk; and Σk|k is the random measurement-set at time tk.

tk; where Υk(x)

The statistics of Ξk|k−1

and Σk|k

are completely

characterized by their belief measures

βk|k−1(S) = Pr(Ξk|k−1 ⊆ S)

βk|k(S) = Pr(Σk|k ⊆ S).

(50)
(51)

Once concrete formulas have been derived for βk|k−1(S)
and βk|k(S),
formulas for the multitarget Markov density
and multitarget likelihood function can be derived using set
derivatives:

fk|k−1(X|X ′) =

fk|k(Z|X) =

δβk|k−1

δX
δβk|k
δZ

(∅|X ′) =(cid:20) δβk|k−1

δX

δZ

(S|X)(cid:21)S=∅

(S|X ′)(cid:21)S=∅

(52)

.

(53)

4) RFS formula for p.g.fl.’s : In 2001 in [23], the belief
measure and set derivative were generalized to, respectively,
the probability generating functional (p.g.fl.) and the func-
tional derivative.

In FISST the p.g.fl. is deﬁned as:

δβΞ
δX
where the set integral is deﬁned by:23

GΞ[h] =Z hX ·

(∅)δX

(54)

∞

1

Xn=0

and where the power functional hX is deﬁned by hX = 1

n!Z f ({x1, ..., xn})dx1 · · · dxn

Z f (X)δX =
if X = ∅ and hX =Qx∈X h(x) if otherwise. Following

modern practice [4], in FISST it is assumed that 0 ≤ h(x) ≤ 1
identically—in which case 0 ≤ GΞ[h] ≤ 1.

(55)

23The factor (n!)−1 is important, because it results in greatly simpliﬁed
It is also often assumed in physics—see [9,

multitarget calculus formulas.
pp. 234, 266].

12

5) Rigorous functional derivatives : The functional deriva-
tive of a functional F [h] was introduced by Volterra
[51, pp. 22-23, 75] and is commonly denoted [7, Eqs.
(A.15,A.23,A.24)]:24

δF

δh(x)

[h] abbr.=

δF
δx

[h]

(56)

where the right side is the abbreviation used in FISST. Note
the following:

• The functional derivative is not the Gˆateaux differential

δwF [h] used by Moyal, Eq. (35).25

• Neither the functional derivative nor the terminology
“functional derivative” occur anywhere in Moyal’s paper.
is linear and continuous in w(·) then
the following gives the relationship between the functional
derivative and the Gˆateaux derivative [51, p. 24, Eq. (3)]:

Rather, if δwF [h]

Z w(x) ·

δF
δx

[h]dx =

∂F
∂w

[h]

(57)

where the right side is the FISST notation26 for a Gˆateaux
derivative (DhF )[w].

The p.g.fl. is a generalized belief measure and the functional

derivative is a generalized set derivative since [26, p. 373]

βΞ(S) = GΞ[1S]

δβΞ
δX

(S) =

δGΞ
δX

[1S].

(58)

(59)

From Eqs. (46,47), it follows that the density functions of
Moyal’s measures P (n)(S1, ..., Sn), M(n)(S1, ..., Sn), and
M(1)(S) can be computed as functional derivatives—which,
rigorously speaking, are set derivatives:27

(∅) = fΞ(X)

(X) = MΞ(X)

(X) = DΞ(x).

(60)

(61)

(62)

6) FISST derivation methodology : This methodology is
based on the p.g.fl. versions of the multitarget prediction
integral and the multitarget Bayes’ rule [26]:

Gk|k−1[h] = Z Gk|k−1[h|X ′] · fk−1|k−1(X)δX (63)

Gk|k[h] =

δFk
δZk
δFk
δZk

[0, h]

[0, 1]

(64)

24This meaning of the term “functional derivative”—i.e., as Volterra’s
derivative—is the established usage in the mathematical literature. Besides
[7, p. 35], see the entry for “functional derivative” in both Wikipedia and the
online Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

25See [7, Eqs. (A.15,A.23,A.24)] or the entry for “Gˆateaux differential” in

Wikipedia or the online Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

26This notation, which is deliberately imitative of undergraduate calculus,

is unique to FISST—but was not so attributed in [48].

27The theoretically rigorous functional derivative

for a
general h(·) is also a set derivative (see [28, Eq. (78)]), but the speciﬁcs
are unnecessary for current purposes.

(δGΞ/δx)[h]

JF,h(α; x) = lim
n→∞

GΞ[h + α · wx,n]

where (without being so identiﬁed in [49]) wx,n are “good
functions” [12, p. 16] such that

lim

n→∞Z wx,n(y) · w(y)dy = w(x)

for any “good function” w. Speciﬁcally in [49] the functional
derivative is recast as:

13

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

where

as follows [49, Eq. (6)]:28

Fk[g, h] = Z hX · Gk[g|X] · fk|k−1(X)δX (65)

Gk|k−1[h|X ′] = Z hX · fk|k−1(X|X ′)δX

Gk[g|X] = Z gZ · fk(Z|X)δZ.

(66)

(67)

Given this, approximate RFS ﬁlters, such as PHD, CPHD, or
multi-Bernoulli ﬁlters, can be derived from the formulas for
Gk|k−1[h] and Gk|k[h].

C. Heuristic Functional Derivatives

Suppose, as is commonly done in physics [38, pp. 173-174],
that we substitute w = δx. Then from Eq. (57) we could
compute the functional derivative directly:

∂F
∂δx

[h] = lim
εց0

GΞ[h + εδx] − GΞ[h]

ε

=

δF
δx

[h].

(68)

However, this substitution is mathematically erroneous in both
Moyal’s and the FISST frameworks. This is because δx(·) is
not only unbounded, it is not even a function since δx(x) =
∞. Nevertheless, in FISST it is employed as a purely heuristic
adjunct to the rigorous deﬁnition, Eq. (44).

In any case, Eq. (68) is not “due to Moyal” or “has exactly
the same meaning as in” Moyal’s [33] because it cannot
be found anywhere in [33]. This, in turn, is because it is
mathematically erroneous in Moyal’s framework.

D. Functional derivatives and “secular functions”

In the paragraph following [48, Eq. (6)], this difﬁculty was

addressed as follows. There it was stated that:

• “Alternatively, specifying the variation to be a function
in a test sequence for the delta function and taking the
limit gives the same result.”

That is, if wx,n → δx (in some sense that is not explained)

then the Gˆateaux derivative in the direction of δx is:

∂GΞ
∂δx

[h] def.= lim
n→∞

∂GΞ
∂wx,n

[h].

(69)

Eq. (69) cannot be “due to Moyal” because it cannot be found
anywhere in Moyal’s paper. This, in turn, is due to the fact
that it is erroneous within the mathematical theory described
therein.
If wn → δx then, for every number ε > 0, there
must exist an integer N > 0 such that kwn − δxk < ε for
all n ≥ N , where k · k is Moyal’s norm, Eq. (34). However,
kwn−δxk is mathematically undeﬁned—and would be inﬁnite
(and therefore always larger than ε) even if deﬁned.

However, the phrase “a test sequence for the delta function”
appears to be an unstated reference to Lighthill’s theory of
“generalized functions” [12]. For, in a subsequent paper [49],
Eq. (69) was recast in terms of the “secular function” deﬁned

J (1)

F,h(0; x) = (cid:20) d

= lim

n→∞(cid:20) d

= lim

where the ﬁrst part of Eq. (74) results from Eq. (37).

However this may be, it is irrelevant. Eq. (69) still cannot
be “due to Moyal” because Moyal neither cites [12] nor makes
any reference to generalized function theory. Indeed, he may
have been unaware of [12] at the time, since it had appeared
only four years earlier.

X. APPENDIX: THE “IFILTER”

In this section, the iFilter is described (Section XI), along
with major mathematical (Section X-B) and phenomenological
(Section X-C) issues in its derivation, as well as various claims
made for it (Section X-D).

A. iFilter: Concept

the “multitarget

Introduced in 2008 in [50],

intensity
ﬁlter”—subsequently renamed the “iFilter”—was promoted as
a signal achievement of the “elementary,” “point process”
approach to multitarget tracking. A two-step process was
adopted in [50]. First, an alleged “elementary” re-derivation
of the PHD ﬁlter was devised. Then, after replacing the PHD
ﬁlter’s clutter and target-appearance models with different
ones, this derivation was refashioned into a derivation of the
iFilter. Consequently, any error in the derivation of the PHD
ﬁlter propagates into an error in the derivation of the iFilter.
We begin with summaries of the PHD ﬁlter (Section X-A2)

and the iFilter (Section X-A1).

1) PHD ﬁlter models and equations : At any prediction
the target-appearance process is assumed to be

time tk−1,
Poisson with known PHD N B
k|k−1
is the expected number of appearing targets and sB
k|k−1(x) is
the spatial distribution of those appearances. The probability
that a target with state x′ at time tk−1 will persist into time
tk is pS(x′) abbr.= pS,k|k−1(x′).
If it persists, the probability

k|k−1(x), where N B

k|k−1sB

28The claimed purpose of “secular functions” is to transform functional
derivatives into ordinary Newtonian derivatives, so that conventional computer
algebra algorithms can be used to construct explicit formulas for functional
derivatives. However, an arsenal of FISST calculus identities (e.g., the general
the derivation of extremely complicated
product and chain rules) permit
functional derivatives (see Chapters 3, 4 of [13]).
It was not explained in
[49] why conventional computer algebra—even if up to the task, which is
questionable—would be more advantageous than the FISST calculus.

Likewise,

any time

with newly-collected
measurement-set Zk,
the clutter process is assumed to be
Poisson with known PHD (intensity function) λkck(z) where
λk is the expected number of clutter measurements (“clutter
rate”) and
is the clutter spatial distribution. The
probability that a target with state x generates a measurement
pD(x) abbr.= pD,k(x), and the probability (density) that
is
this measurement will be z is fk(z|x). The PHD ﬁlter
measurement-update is:

ck(z)

Dk|k(x)
Dk|k−1(x)

= LZk (x)

(76)

pD(x) · fk(z|x)
λkck(z) + τ k(z)

(77)

= 1 − pD(x) + Xz∈Zk

where τ k(z) =R pD(x) · fk(z|x) · Dk|k−1(x)dx and where

LZk (x) is called the “pseudolikelihood.”

2) iFilter models and equations : The following material
In [50] the target state space
ﬁrst appeared in 2012 in [16].
X is replaced by X+= X ⊎ Xφ where Xφ
is a space
of “clutter targets” from which all clutter measurements are
generated. The probability that a “clutter target” will generate
a clutter measurement is pD(φ), and the probability (density)
that it will generate z is ck(z).

The appearance of a new target with state x at time tk
is modeled as the transition of some clutter target to x, as
described by

ψk(x|φ) = (1 − ψk(φ|φ)) · sB

k+1|k(x),

(78)

where ψk(φ|φ)
is the probability that a clutter target will
transition to another clutter target. Analogously, clutter at time
tk is modeled as the transition of a target at time tk−1 with
state x′
to to some clutter target, with probability ψk(φ|x′).
Thus an actual target with state x′ at time tk−1 transitions
to an actual target with state x at time tk according to

ψk(x|x′) = (1 − ψk(φ|x′)) · fk+1|k(x|x′).

(79)

The iFilter propagates not only the PHD Dk|k(x) but also,
˙Nk|k of clutter targets. It was

implicitly, the expected number
claimed in [50, p. 1] that:

• “[T]he target birth and measurement clutter processes that
are assumed speciﬁed a priori in [Mahler’s PHD papers]
are estimated here.”

This is untrue.

In actuality, ck(z) and sB

assumed known a priori (in fact,
sB
k|k−1(x)
assumed to be constant29) and thus only λk
k|k−1
are estimated. However, even this turns out to be untrue in
general, see Section X-D.

(83)

where ˆλk = pD(φ) ·

˙Nk|k−1 is a claimed estimate of λk.

B. iFilter: Mathematical issues

In [50, Eq. (27)], the authors introduce c > 0 such that

m

Xj=1

To reverse-engineer Eq. (76), they must show that c = m,
where m is the current number of measurements. Without
proof, they claimed that (1) c is a random variable whose
L(c) ∝ e−ccm [50, Eq. (28)];
probability distribution is
and (2) c can be determined by applying the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) estimator to e−ccm, resulting in c = m.
This argument contains three major errors of basic statistical
reasoning, ﬁrst pointed out in 2010 [18]:

1) c is not a random variable.

It is actually equal to m,
which—since it is a ﬁxed realization of a random integer
M —is a constant. Thus c is also a constant.

2) The probability distribution of

is, therefore, not
L(c) ∝ e−ccm but rather a Dirac delta L(c) = δm(c)
(which, of course, cannot be legitimately assumed since
this would require knowing a priori that c = m—the
very thing that is to be proved).

c

3) Why a MAP estimator rather than, say, the expected

value estimator—in which case we get c 6= m?

Thus, unfortunately, the “elementary” derivation of the PHD
ﬁlter is erroneous. Consequently, so is the “elementary”
derivation of the iFilter.30

C. iFilter: Phenomenological issues

There is a more fundamental difﬁculty:

the iFilter appears
to be questionable from a phenomenological point of view
[16]. The key concept underlying it is the notion of modeling
clutter (and target disappearances) as transitions of actual
targets to “clutter targets,” and modeling target appearances
as transitions of “clutter targets” to actual targets.

30The above major errors are not the only ones in [50], just the ones that

are most easily explained and understood.

However, an effective multitarget tracker must be able to
accurately distinguish targets from background clutter.
It is
therefore crucial to efﬁciently exploit differences between (1)
clutter versus target measurement-generation statistics, and (2)
clutter versus target motion (i.e., state-transition statistics).

But when targets are allowed to become clutter and/or vice-
versa, clutter statistics and target statistics become intertwined.
This will make it more difﬁcult to distinguish targets from
clutter—e.g., when a jet ﬁghter can transition to a radar false
alarm or vice-versa. Such difﬁculties will be even more
pronounced when the statistics of the targets depend on target
identity—e.g., when a helicopter can transition to a windmill
or a tank to a shed, or vice-versa.

In a correct model, actual targets must transition only to
actual targets and “clutter targets” only to “clutter targets.”
This issue is discussed at length in pp. 558-560 of [13].

D. iFilter: Other issues

k|k−1 might be.

R ψk(x|φ)dx = 1 − ˙pT

The following claims were made in [50]:
1) Claim 1: The iFilter can always estimate the target-
appearance rate ˆN B
k|k−1 : False, as is shown by the following
counterexample [16]. Suppose that there is no clutter, in which
case there can be no “clutter targets.” In this case ˙Nk−1|k−1—
the expected number of “clutter targets”—must be zero, so that
ˆN B

k|k−1 = 0 regardless of what N B
2) Claim 2: The iFilter can always estimate the clutter
rate λk : False, as is shown by the following counterexample.
Assume that pD(x) = pD(φ) = 1 and that the probability
of target disappearance is constant, ψk(φ|x) = 1 − pT . Let
be the total probability that a single
target will appear. Finally, suppose that these happen to be
“conjugate” in the sense that pT + ˙pT = 1. Then it is easily
shown [16] that
and therefore that the
estimated clutter rate is ˆλk = ˙Nk|k−1 = ˙pT · mk for any k.
That is, ˆλk
is a always a ﬁxed fraction of the current number
of measurements, regardless of what λk might actually be.
the
iFilter31
: False, because the PHD ﬁlter time-update is not a
special case of the iFilter time-update. As a counterexample,
once again assume that
there is no clutter and therefore
no clutter generators. Since
the iFilter
target-appearance term in Eq. (80) vanishes—whereas the
corresponding PHD ﬁlter term in Eq. (75) does not.

˙Nk+1|k = ˙pT · mk

3) Claim 3:

The PHD ﬁlter is a special case of

˙Nk−1|k−1 = 0,

Furthermore, it is the reverse claim that is true:

the iFilter
is actually a PHD ﬁlter with a questionable state-transition
model. Speciﬁcally, and has been shown in [16] or Section
631-636 and p. 644 of [13],
the iFilter can—using only
straightforward algebra—be directly derived as an ordinary
PHD ﬁlter under the following assumptions: (i) the state space
is X ⊎ Xφ; and (ii) the state-transition model on X ⊎ Xφ is
the questionable iFilter intermixing model.

Moreover, and as is shown in [30], [32], [6] and pp. 560-593
of [13], straightforward algebra can be used to derive a “κ-
CPHD ﬁlter” that can estimate not only λk but also ck(z); as
well as a “λ-CPHD ﬁlter” special case that estimates only λk.

31To wit: “Replacing the estimated clutter intensity with the a priori clutter

intensity gives the PHD ﬁlter...” ([50], p. 6, 1st paragraph).

15

4) Claim 4:

k|k−1(x) in addition to λk, ck(z), and pκ

FISST p.g.fl. methods can additionally be applied to estimate
the probability distribution pκ
k(m) on the number m of
clutter measurements at time tk (see [31] or p. 592 of [13]).
This approach can be further extended to estimate N B
and sB

k|k−1
k(m) [17].
Finally, suppose that there are few target appearances or
disappearances. Then it can be shown that the questionable
intermixing state-transition model will be approximately dis-
abled and that, as a consequence, the iFilter will behave like
the λ-PHD ﬁlter special case of the λ-CPHD ﬁlter (see [16]).
“Intensity ﬁlters” can be understood in
essentially elementary terms: False—even if the derivations
of the PHD ﬁlter and “intensity ﬁlter” in [50] were not
erroneous. Reverse-engineering of the PHD, CPHD, and other
RFS ﬁlters has become something of a subspeciality—see pp.
200-201 of [13]. However, the following questions must be
posed whenever some claim of engineering superiority vis-a-
vis FISST is asserted or implied in any such exercise: Would
its authors have been able to independently come up with the
correct answer if they had not been able to (so to speak) look
it up in the back of the FISST textbook? What does their
method accomplish other than re-inventing the wheel?

In the speciﬁc case of the “elementary,” “point process”
approach:
it has apparently not been possible to reverse-
engineer the CPHD ﬁlter using only “single target Bayesian
ﬁltering and with PPP’s at an elementary level”—or to devise
a CPHD ﬁlter generalization of the iFilter.

XI. APPENDIX: THE MULTISENSOR IFILTER

This section begins with a background summary of mul-
tisensor PHD and CPHD ﬁlters (Section XI-A). Then the
multisensor version of the iFilter is described (Section XI-B),
along with major mathematical issues in its derivation (Section
XI) and performance issues (Section XI-D). The “multisensor
trafﬁc mapping ﬁlter” is discussed in Section XI-E), along with
major mathematical (Section XI-F) and conceptual (Section
XI-G) issues in its derivation.

A. Multisensor PHD and CPHD ﬁlters

The PHD and CPHD ﬁlters, like the iFilter, presume the
existence of a single sensor. Shortly after its introduction, the
PHD ﬁlter was heuristically extended by several authors to
the multisensor case using the “iterated corrector” approach—
i.e., by sequentially applying the PHD ﬁlter update equation,
Eq. (76), once for each sensor. However, the output of this
ﬁlter depends on sensor order. While this has little effect
on performance when sensor probabilities of detection are
approximately equal, performance can be signiﬁcantly affected
otherwise (see [34] or pp. 288-289 of [13]).

An exact multisensor PHD ﬁlter was introduced in 2009 (see
[19] and pp. 283-287 of [13]), but is computationally chal-
lenging. Three “parallel combination” (PCAM) PHD/CPHD
ﬁlters, which are computationally tractable and independent
of sensor order, were introduced in 2010 (see [14] and pp.
289-300 of [13]). The simplest and least accurate of these is

a “product pseudolikelihood” PHD ﬁlter. That is, the pseu-
dolikelihoods of Eq. (77) are constructed for each sensor and
then multiplied together to create a joint pseudolikelihood.32

B. Multisensor iFilter: Concept

At the same time that the iFilter was introduced in 2008,
a “Bayesian” attempt was made to extend both it and the
PHD ﬁlter to the multisensor case [45]. Speciﬁcally, the
predicted PHD Dk|k−1(x)
is updated using each sensor,
and the resulting PHDs are averaged. This is equivalent to
an “averaged-pseudolikelihood” approach. That is, for the
PHD ﬁlter, the pseudolikelihoods of Eq. (77) are constructed
for each sensor and then averaged (rather than multiplied) to
create a joint pseudolikelihood:

C. Multisensor iFilter: Mathematical issues
in 2009 [20],

As was ﬁrst pointed out

the averaged-
pseudolikelihood approach appears to be conceptually ques-
tionable and, from a Bayesian point of view, mathematically
erroneous.
Its performance is also demonstrably worse than
RFS multisensor PHD/CPHD ﬁlters. The discussion ﬁrst
appeared in [28] and is excerpted from pp. 300-309 of [13].
a single target is
present and the sensors have no clutter and no missed detec-
tions. The predicted and updated PHDs are then probability
density functions and Eq. (85) becomes

Consider the following special case:

2) Since the track distribution

f k|k(x) is a mixture distri-
bution, it will cause localization accuracy to decrease
(as compared to the single-sensor track distributions
fk|k(x| ℓ
z)); and localization accuracy will decrease fur-
ther with the number of sensors.

The second point

is most easily demonstrated using a
two bearing-only sensors in the plane, with

simple example:
respective likelihood functions

Lz(x, y) = Nσ2 (z − x)

(90)

2

Lz(x, y) = Nσ2 (z − y)

(91)
where Nσ2(z) denotes a one-dimensional Gaussian distribu-
tion with variance σ2. That is, the sensors are oriented so as
to triangulate the position of a target located at (x, y). For
conceptual clarity, let the prior distribution be

fk|k−1(x, y) = Nσ2

(92)

where σ2

tion of the third sensor was decreased to pD = 0.85 and
again to pD = 0.7.

E. The “multisensor trafﬁc mapping ﬁlter”

In [45], the “multisensor multitarget intensity ﬁlter” was ex-
plicitly identiﬁed as a multitarget tracking ﬁlter. As previously
noted, the theoretically problematic nature of this multisensor
tracking ﬁlter was pointed out in 2009 [20] and its poor
tracking performance in 2011 [35].

A year later, the following revelation appeared:

the “mul-
tisensor multitarget intensity ﬁlter” in [45] had not only been
“misidentiﬁed there as a multisensor target ﬁlter” (emphasis
added), it was actually something quite different: a “multi-
sensor trafﬁc mapping ﬁlter” [45, p. 1]. Which is to say:
it
appears that the “elementary,” “point process” derivation of the
“multisensor multitarget intensity ﬁlter”—i.e., as a multitarget
tracking ﬁlter—had to have been erroneous at a fundamental
conceptual level.

The purpose of the “multisensor trafﬁc mapping ﬁlter” is as
follows: “estimate, or map, the mean rate at which different
regions of a state space generate target detection opportunities
in a ﬁeld of distributed sensors” [45, p. 1].
It was further
claimed to be “practical for applications with large numbers
of sensors because [its] computational complexity is linear in
the numbers of sensors and measurements” [45, p. 1].

Eq. (95) is erroneous, unfortunately. As a consequence,
the claimed computational linearity of the “multisensor trafﬁc
mapping ﬁlter” is spurious since Eq. (95) is not a theoretically
valid measurement-update equation.

The proof of Eq. (95) was based on the following p.g.fl.

identity (asserted without proof) [46, Eq. (20)]:

However, even given these “trafﬁc process” assumptions, Eq.
(96)—and thus Eq. (95)—is true only if ∗n = 1 (i.e., only for
a single sensor).

A detailed counterexample under such assumptions can
be found in Appendix K.3 of [13]. However, a simpler
counterexample is more informative. Assume that Eq. (96)
is true.
a
single target, and two sensors with no missed detections or
false alarms. Under these assumptions, Eq. (96) reduces to

If so, it is true for the following special case:

z) · 2g( 2

z|x) · fk( 2

z|x)

z) · h(x) · fk( 2

z|x) · fk|k−1(x)d 2

zdx(cid:19)
zdx(cid:19) .

If this is true, it must be true for the following special case:
fk( 1
z) identically—in which
case Eq. (96) reduces to

z) and fk( 2

z|x) = fk( 1

z|x) = fk( 2

Z h(x) · fk|k−1(x)dx =(cid:18)Z h(x) · fk|k−1(x)dx(cid:19)2

. (101)

If this is true, it must be true when h(x) = 1/2 identically—
in which case Eq. (96) reduces to 1/2 = 1/4, a contradiction.
The source of the error appears to have been a mistaken

presumption that Eq. (96) is true because Eq. (99) is true.

G. “Trafﬁc mapping ﬁlter”: Conceptual issues

When closely examined, the “multisensor trafﬁc mapping

ﬁlter” appears to be a multitarget tracking ﬁlter in disguise.

ℓ

First, it is not clear what real-world problem “trafﬁc map-
β(x) are claimed to model
ping” is meant to solve. The
“geometrical considerations concerning the point [x] and the
entire sensor ﬁeld” [45, p. 46]. But what are these “geometri-
cal considerations,” and what is the precise physical meaning
of
in regard to them? How might one construct a
concrete formula for

β(x)

β(x)?

ℓ

ℓ

Second, the term “target detection opportunity” is never
deﬁned in a precise manner, mathematically or physically. We
are informed only that such “opportunities” are “correlated
with regions containing targets” [45, p. 48] and that they
include “both detections and missed detections” [45, p. 45].

Given this, it is unclear why “target detection opportunity”
is not just a synonym for “target.” It is unclear how to count
a missed detection as a “target detection opportunity,” unless
one has previously established the existence of a target, which
should have been detected but was not.
It is unclear how to
count a detection as a “target detection opportunity,” unless
one has ﬁrst determined that it was caused by an established
(or new) target rather than clutter. That is: not only is a target
a “target detection opportunity,” one cannot have a “target
detection opportunity” in the absence of a target. The two
concepts appear to be synonymous.
