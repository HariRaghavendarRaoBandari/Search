There is still no general consensus on how one can describe the out-of-equilibrium phenomena in
matter induced by an ultrashort light pulse. We investigate the pulse-induced dynamics in a layered
Dirac semimetal SrMnBi2 by pump-and-probe photoemission spectroscopy. At .1 ps, the electronic
recovery slowed upon increasing the pump power. Such a bottleneck-type slowing is expected in
a two-temperature model (TTM) scheme, although opposite trends have been observed to date in
graphite and in cuprates. Subsequently, an unconventional power-law cooling took place at ∼100 ps,
indicating that spatial heat diﬀusion is still ill deﬁned at ∼100 ps. We identify that the successive
dynamics before the emergence of heat diﬀusion is a canonical realization of a TTM scheme. Criteria
for the applicability of the scheme is also provided.

When founding the

Dirac fermions in matter, as realized in graphene [1]
and on surface of topological insulators (TIs) [2], yield
intriguing properties: Dirac fermions are highly mo-
bile [1, 3] and can tunnel through inﬁnitely high bar-
riers [4, 5]; in magnetic ﬁelds, they can gain non-trivial
Berry’s phase [6, 7]; when contacted to a superconduc-
tor, Majorana modes may emerge [8, 9]. Dirac materials
are also usable as wide-band mode lockers that create ul-
trashort laser pulses of any color, owing to an ability to
absorb light over a broad range of wavelengths [10–12];
Broad-band lasing may also be realized [12–15]. Inves-
tigations of the optical responses of Dirac fermions have
opened pathways to take control of their charge [16–18],
spin [19–21] and topological properties [22, 23] by light.
functions of optically non-
equilibrated Dirac materials [10–23], it becomes impor-
tant to understand how the energy of light is transferred
to matter and converted thereafter. In fact, there is still
no counterpart for the well-established 2-, 3-, or 4-level
rate equations that nicely describes the population in-
versions in conventional lasers. Applying the concepts
in two-temperature model (TTM) [24] and Rothwarf-
Taylor model (RTM) [25] can be a viable approach. How-
ever, there is no general consensus to what extent, if at
all, the models are suited for the description. Whether
to approach from the metal side (TTM) or from the
semiconductor side (RTM) is also a question, because
Dirac materials are semimetals.
Indeed, there are dis-
cussions that the TTM scheme is broken in graphite [26]
as well as in cuprates [27], while extensions of TTM
also exist [28, 29]. Meanwhile, continuous progress in
pump-and-probe methods allows us to investigate the
ultrafast phenomena in depth, thereby allowing us to
test and develop our understandings from the experi-
mental side. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) implemented by the pump-and-probe method
enables us to resolve the carrier dynamics in energy
(E) and momentum (k) space, as done on TIs [15–17],
graphene [14], and cuprates [29–33], to mention a few.

By means of time-resolved ARPES (TARPES), we
study the ultrafastly-induced dynamics in SrMnBi2,
which is a new type of Dirac materials that has layers
of quasi-two-dimensional Dirac fermions [34–38]. Utiliz-
ing the high energy resolution and stability of our ap-
paratus [39], we investigated the carrier dynamics in-
duced by various pump-power values (P ’s). We also
looked into the 100-ps time region, which has not been
investigated in detail because the pump-induced varia-
tions become small. Around 1 ps, the electronic recovery
slowed upon the increase of P . This is the behavior of the
phonon-bottleneck eﬀect expected in the TTM scheme,
although opposite trends have been observed to date in
graphite [26] and in cuprates [31, 32]. In the 100-ps time
region, an unconventional power-law cooling took place,
indicating that the spatial diﬀusion of heat is still ill de-
ﬁned. Based on the results, we discuss that the chronol-
ogy of the Dirac-fermion dynamics before the emergence
of heat diﬀusion is a nice realization of the TTM scheme.
Our study provides criteria for the applicability of the
TTM scheme as well as its solid realization, and lays a
basis for understanding the ultrafast dynamics in matter.
SrMnBi2 consists of alternate stacks of MnBi layers
and Bi square nets separated by Sr ions [Fig. 1(a)].
The Bi square net has two Bi sites in its unit cell
and hosts four anisotropic Dirac cones in the Brillouin
zone [34, 40, 41]. The charge dynamics around EF is
governed by the Bi electrons in the square net and is vir-
tually decoupled from the Mn moments in the MnBi lay-
ers [34, 37]. Because the Dirac fermions exist in volume,
the Dirac-related properties manifest as a bulk, such as
the high bulk mobility and non-zero Berry’s phase in the
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations [34]. Recent studies sug-
gest that the Dirac fermions can be manipulated magnet-
ically [42, 43] and even modiﬁed into Weyl fermions [44]
by replacing the Sr ions for other species.

SrMnBi2 single crystals were grown by the self-ﬂux
method [43]. The temperature proﬁles of the in-plane
(ρxx) and interlayer (ρzz) resistivity [Fig. 1(b)] dis-

played anisotropic metallic behavior characterized by
ρxx(300 K)/ρxx(2 K) = 17.5 and ρzz(8 K)/ρxx(8 K) =
623. TARPES apparatus consisted of a hemispherical
analyzer and a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser system de-
livering 1.48-eV pump and 5.92-eV probe pulses at 250-
kHz repetition [39]. Time and energy resolutions were
270 fs and 18 meV, respectively. Samples were cleaved in
the spectrometer at .5 × 10−11 Torr. By utilizing a pin
hole attached next to the sample, we estimated the spot
diameters of the pump and probe beams to be 250 and
85 µm, respectively, and also checked that the movement
of the pump beam was less than 5 µm when the delay
stage was shifted for 600 ps pump-probe delay. Samples
were held at T0 = 8 K during the measurements.

Figure 1(c) shows the results of the Fermi surface map-
ping. A crescent-like distribution is observed in the map
as reported in previous ARPES studies [34, 40, 41]. Pan-
els in Fig. 1(d) show band dispersions along Γ - M [indi-
cated by an arrow in Fig. 1(c)] recorded before (-0.80 ps)
and upon (0.17 ps) the arrival of the pump pulse. In the
latter, the unoccupied side is transiently populated. To
highlight the bands [40, 41], we present second deriva-
tive images with respect to k in Fig. 1(e). We observe a
conical band extending into the unoccupied side, which
is attributed to the lower Dirac cone (LDC) crossing EF ;

images. Top panels show band dispersions, and bottom panels
show diﬀerence to the averaged image before pumping. (b,
c) Mappings of angle-integrated photoemission intensity (b)
and its pump-induced diﬀerence (c) as functions of energy
and delay time for three pump-power values P = 30, 60, and
90 mW (top to bottom). P = 30 mW corresponds to the
pump ﬂuence of 0.24 mJ/cm2. (d) Photoemission intensity
variation as functions of t for the three pump-power values.

That is, the Dirac cone is p-type doped. The cone has
a summit at 0.35 ˚A−1 away from Γ . The observed band
nicely matched to the calculated LDC [46] which has
anisotropic band velocities of 2.1 and 2.8 eV ˚A in the
Γ and M sides, respectively, and that is gapped from the
upper Dirac cone (UDC) due to spin-orbit interaction;
see Fig. 1(e). Here, the calculated bands are overlaid on
the image without any shift in E and k. Pump-induced
ﬁlling of UDC was negligibly small [45], whose implica-
tion will be described later.

The electronic dynamics induced by the pump pulse
was investigated by recording TARPES images along Γ -
M at various delays; see Fig. 2(a).
In order to show

clearly the pump-induced variations, we subtracted an
average of 10 images recorded before the pumping (t <
-0.5 ps) from the TARPES images, and displayed the
diﬀerence images in the lower panels. Upon the arrival
of the pump pulse, the spectral intensity is spread into
the unoccupied side. The changes are conﬁned within
∼0.2 eV around EF . Subsequent recovery is mostly ac-
complished within ∼2 ps, which is typical to the re-
sponses of metals [47]. However, we also observe that
the pump-induced changes remain even at >100 ps.

The dynamics is thus characterized by the following
three stages: (1) A rapid pump-induced redistribution of
electrons in a narrow energy range of ∼0.2 eV around
EF ; (2) an initial recovery occurring within ∼2 ps; (3)
a prolonged recovery of >100 ps. Below, we investigate
the three stages step by step.

First, we look into the electron redistribution upon the
arrival of the pump pulse. Panels in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c)
respectively show angle-integrated photoemission inten-
sity (I) and its pump-induced variation (∆I = I − I0)
mapped in ω - t plane (ω ≡ E − EF ). Here, I0(ω) is
the average of I(ω, t) at t < -0.5 ps and represents the
spectrum before pumping. At all pump power values in-
vestigated, we do not observe any delayed response, and
the distribution nicely obeys the Fermi-Dirac function;
See, supplementary movie ﬁle [45]. Shown in Fig. 2(d)
are the intensity variation as functions of t at various en-
ergy regions. Irrelevant to the pump power, we observe
time-resolution-limited rise of intensity at E > EF .

The quasi-instantaneous realization of thermal elec-
tron distribution is typically observed in metals [47]. The
low-energy excitations across EF can screen the direct
excitation, which, in eﬀect, smears out the direct excita-
tion and results in the electron redistribution around EF
within our time resolution. In the case for TIs, there is
a strong indirect-and-delayed ﬁlling of the surface Dirac
bands, which is attributed to a process where electrons
are ﬁrst excited in the bulk across the band gap and then
transferred into the surface bands [17]. Apparently, such
a delayed channel does not exist in SrMnBi2, and there-
fore, the metallic response dominated in the p-type-doped
Dirac band. The absence of the ﬁlling into the UDC [45]
further shows that the number of the electrons excited
into the UDC was negligibly small. If such electrons had
existed, they would have piled up at the bottom of the
UDC to exhibit an inverted population, as observed in
the surface Dirac bands of a p-type TI Sb2Te3 [15].

Next, we investigate the initial electronic recov-
ery within ∼2 ps.
Here, we evaluate ∆U (t) ≡
Rω≥0 ω∆I(ω, t) dω, which is a good measure of the ex-
cess electronic energy [26]. Figure 3(a) displays ∆U (t)
normalized to the pump power P for three representa-
tive P ’s. The peak height of ∆U (t)/P around t = 0 is
overlapped, indicating that the excess electronic energy
deposited by the pump pulse is linear to P . Moreover,
we ﬁnd that the recovery slows upon the increase of P ,
as opposed to the case in graphite [26]. The slowing is a
piece of evidence for the phonon bottleneck eﬀect taking

place in the TTM scheme, which we describe below.

The TTM scheme is often a starting point to under-
stand the ultrafast dynamics in metals [24, 29]. In this
scheme, the pump pulse ﬁrst raises the electronic tem-
perature Te while leaving the lattice temperature Tp low.
Subsequently, the heated electrons transfer energy to the
lattice. The conductance of the energy ﬂow from the
hot electrons to the coupled optical phonons is described
by the coupling constant λ [24, 29].
In applying the
TTM scheme, we have derived Te(t) by ﬁtting I(ω, t) to
a Fermi-Dirac function multiplied by a linear density of
states [45]. We set that 3f phonon modes are coupled to
the electronic system. The heat capacity of the coupled

phonon modes Cp(Tp) = f ˜Cp ( ˜Cp is the heat capacity for
one atom per unit cell) is described by the Debye tem-
perature TD = 310 K [48]. The use of Einstein model
for ˜Cp did not change the discussion below [45]. We also
treat the uncoupled phonons as a heat bath held at T0 =
8 K, to which the coupled phonons transfer energy with
a characteristic time τ . The energy rate equation of the
extended TTM [29] reads,

Here, kB and  are Boltzmann and Planck constants, re-
spectively; Ce/Te = 36.5 mJ/mol K2 [49] is the electronic
speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient; G(t) is a Gaussian function rep-
resenting the temporal proﬁle of the pump pulse; ω0 =
3pπ/6 × kBTD = 21 meV is the Einstein optical-mode
energy corresponding to the vibrations of Bi atoms [45].
The set of Te(t) for three values of P is displayed in
Fig. 3(b). The proﬁles of Te(t) are nicely reproduced by
the theoretical curves of (λ, f ) = (0.06, 1.5). f is smaller
than the number of the atoms in the unit cell [8; see Fig.
1(a)], indicating that only a portion of the phonon modes
are heated up by the hot electrons within ∼2 ps. The
coupled modes are naturally attributed to some optical
modes [29], while the rest are the cold phonons composed
of acoustic modes and the uncoupled optical modes. In
the inset to Fig. 3(b), we display the excess electronic
energy ∆Ue calculated by the model through the rela-
tionship ∆U ∝ ∆T 2
e . The recovery of ∆Ue slows upon
the increase of P , and the model semi-quantitatively re-
produces the pump-power dependence of ∆U displayed
in Fig. 3(a). The slowing occurs because the heat transfer
is bottlenecked by the small coupling constant λ = 0.06
≪ 1. We note that a so-called ballistic diﬀusive term [50]
was not needed to describe the dynamics at .2 ps.

We thus demonstrated the match between the exper-
iment and theoretical model not only for a particular P
but for a set of P ’s, and hence, the phonon-bottleneck
eﬀect manifesting in the pump-power dependency. The
analysis showed that the Dirac fermions are weakly cou-
pled into some optical modes. Whether the bottleneck ef-
fect appears in the pump-power dependency or not can be
a good measure of the applicability of the TTM scheme.
Finally, we investigate the prolonged recovery after
∼2 ps (≡ t0) detected by our apparatus. Figure 3(d)
shows double-logarithmic scale plots of the electronic
temperature variations ∆T = Te − T0 versus t. For
all the pump power values investigated, we observe that
the cooling after t = t0 obeys a power-law behavior
∆T ∝ t−α with α = 0.21 ± 0.02. The power-law ex-
ponent is diﬀerent from what is expected in a diﬀusive-
type cooling: If lateral heat diﬀusion out of the pumped
region was taking place [two-dimensional diﬀusion; see
upper schematic of Fig. 3(e)], α = 1, whereas in the
case for one-dimensional diﬀusion of heat into bulk, α =

4

1/2 [45]. If we force to ﬁt the cooling behavior by tak-
ing into account the spatial spread of ∆T at t = t0, the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient became unphysically large [45]. The
results indicate that the spatial diﬀusion of heat is still
ill deﬁned at ∼100 ps.
In the TTM scheme, the cool-
ing can nevertheless occur without violating the energy
conservation law, because the composite of the electrons
and coupled phonons can transfer the excess energy to
the cold phonons [Fig. 3(c)] still existing in the pumped
region; That is, a local cooling can occur, see Fig. 3(e).
The power-law exponent provides constraints to the mi-
croscopic mechanism of the unusual cooling, such as an-
harmonic decays of optical phonons into acoustic modes.
The hot spot created by the pump should eventually
cool down by transferring heat to the surroundings, so
that the unusual cooling at ∼100 ps should subsequently
crossover into the usual ones accompanying spatial ﬂow
of heat. Generally, heat ﬂow is carried by the acoustic
modes, because their group velocities (vg ∼ 1 - 5 km/s)
are larger than those of the optical modes. The grad-
ual population of the acoustic modes through the anhar-
monic decay at ∼100 ps will gradually trigger the heat to
ﬂow out of the hot spot. The ﬂow into bulk will predomi-
nate the initial cooling, because the temperature gradient
is steepest in the depth direction: Typical depth of the
hot spot L ∼ 100 nm (equivalent to the optical pene-
tration depth of the pump [51]) is smaller than the spot
diameter of 250 µm. Once the acoustic modes are pop-
ulated, subsequent drop of temperature will prevail with
the time scale L/vg ∼ 20 - 100 ps; Therefore, the ∼100-
ps time region can be regarded as the transient where
the heat is starting to ﬂow, cross-overing into the &1000-
ps time region where cooling can indeed occur through
various types of heat ﬂows including the ballistic trans-
mission of acoustic phonons [52–54].

We demonstrated that the ultrafastly induced dynam-
ics in SrMnBi2 exhibits the bottleneck eﬀect (slowing
of the electronic recovery upon increasing P ) at ∼1 ps
and subsequent unconventional power-law cooling in the
100-ps time region. These characteristics were nicely de-
scribed by a TTM scheme, in which the Dirac fermions
are weakly coupled into some optical phonons. Our study
provides a starting point to understand the ultrafast dy-
namics under stronger couplings and excitations: The
strong couplings may result in the breakdown of the TTM
scheme [26–28, 55, 56] or the band structures [14, 31, 57]
and concepts of quasi-particles may have to be seriously
taken into account [30, 33]; A warm-dense matter will
be reached at stronger excitations [58–60]. A variety of
pump-and-probe methodologies are needed to deepen in-
sights into the strongly-correlated ultrafast phenomena.
