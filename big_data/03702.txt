WEAK CAYLEY TABLE GROUPS OF SOME

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC GROUPS

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

Abstract. For a group G, a weak Cayley isomorphism is a bijection f : G →
G such that f (g1g2) is conjugate to f (g1)f (g2) for all g1, g2 ∈ G. They form
a group W(G) that is the group of symmetries of the weak Cayley table of
G. We determine W(G) for each of the seventeen wallpaper groups G, and for
some other crystallographic groups.

Keywords: Weak Cayley table groups, wallpaper groups, conjugacy class.

§1 Introduction

For a group G the weak Cayley table group W(G) is the set of bijections f : G →
G such that f (g1g2) ∼ f (g1)f (g2) for all g1, g2 ∈ G. Here ∼ denotes conjugacy in
G. An element of W(G) is called a weak Cayley table isomorphism (of G).

It is easy to see that W(G) is a group that contains Aut(G) and the inverse map
ι = ιG : G → G : ι(g) = g−1. We let W0(G) = hAut(G), ιi, the subgroup of trivial
weak Cayley table isomorphisms. We note that W0(G) = Aut(G) × hιGi.

If G = {g1 = 1, g2, . . . }, then the group W(G) acts naturally on the weak Cayley
table, this being the |G| × |G| matrix whose ij entry is the conjugacy class of gigj.
It is well-known that two ﬁnite groups have the same weak Cayley table if and only
if they have the same 1- and 2-characters, in the sense of Frobenius [JMS]. Here,
for a character χ, the corresponding 1-character is χ(1) = χ, and the 2-character is
χ(2) : G2 → C, χ(2)(x, y) = χ(x)χ(y) − χ(xy).

We note that the notion of k-character only makes sense in the situation where
G is ﬁnite; however the weak Cayley table is deﬁned for any countable group, and
the group W(G) makes sense for any group.

In previous papers [Hu, HN, HN2] we have determined classes of groups that
have the property W(G) = W0(G); these include ﬁnite symmetric groups, some free
groups and free products, Coxeter groups, P SL(2, pn) and some sporadic groups.
Groups with this property are termed trivial. Elements of W(G) \ W0(G) are called
non-trivial.

In this paper we consider the seventeen wallpaper groups G, and determine the
group W(G) explicitly; while doing so we determine which are trivial. We recall
the standard notation and deﬁnitions for these crystallographic groups [Ja, Iv]: a
wallpaper group is a discrete group of isometries of the plane whose subgroup, A,
of translations is isomorphic to Z2. Two such are considered equivalent if they are
conjugate by an aﬃne transformation. Such a group contains only translations,
rotations, reﬂections and glide reﬂections as symmetries. We use the Hermann-
Mauguin notation for wallpaper groups. We note that the automorphism group
Aut(G) of each wallpaper group G has been determined in [GW], however we do

not make use of their result in this paper, and so our classiﬁcation will give an
independent proof of their result.

One consequence of what we do is:

Theorem 1.1. Let G be one of the 17 wallpaper groups. Then we have W(G) 6=
W0(G) if and only if either
(i) G is a direct product of non-abelian groups, or
(ii) G contains only translations and rotations, with some rotation of order greater
than two.

If G has rotations of order at least four then there is a subgroup N (G) ⊳ W(G),

all of whose non-identity elements are non-trivial, such that

W(G) = N (G) ⋊ W0(G).

More detailed descriptions of the groups W(G) will be given later.

Let Cm denote the cyclic group of order m. Many crystallographic groups in

higher dimensions have the form Zn ⋊ Cm; for groups of this type we have:

Theorem 1.2. The semi-direct product Zn ⋊ C2, n ≥ 0, has trivial weak Cayley
table group.

Theorem 1.3. Let p be an odd prime and let G = Zn ⋊ Cp, n ≥ 1, be a non-abelian
semi-direct product. Then G has a non-trivial weak Cayley table map.

In §2 we recall some facts about elements of W(G), describe properties of wall-
paper groups, and explain the strategy for ﬁnding W(G) for each wallpaper group
G. In the remaining sections we prove the various steps outlined in the strategy.

§2 Weak Cayley table maps and wallpaper groups

We collect together some results on weak Cayley table isomorphisms taken from
[JMS]. A weak Cayley table map is a function ϕ : G → H such that f (g1g2) ∼
f (g1)f (g2), for all g1, g2 ∈ G, where ∼ denotes conjugacy in H.

Lemma 2.1. [JMS] Let ϕ : G → G be a weak Cayley table isomorphism and let
g ∈ G, N ⊳ G. Then,
(1) ϕ(e) = e and ϕ(g−1) = ϕ(g)−1, where e denotes the identity element of G.
Further, if g2 = e, then ϕ(g)2 = e.
(2) ϕ(N ) ⊳ G.
(3) ϕ(gN ) = ϕ(g)ϕ(N ).
(4) ϕ induces a weak Cayley table map ˜ϕ : G/N → G/ϕ(N ).
(5) ϕ−1 : G → G is a weak Cayley table isomorphism.
(6) If a, b ∈ G, then a ∼ b if and only if ϕ(a) ∼ ϕ(b).

We have already remarked that a wallpaper group G contains a translation sub-
If G = A, then certainly
group A. Also G = A if and only if G is abelian.
W(G) = W0(G), so we will assume that G is not abelian from now on. The follow-
ing is well-known:

Lemma 2.2. Let G be a non-abelian wallpaper group. Then

(i) [G : A] < ∞;
(ii) g ∈ G has a ﬁnite conjugacy class if and only if g ∈ A.

Here we list presentations for each wallpaper group. We also, for each of the

seventeen wallpaper groups, identify a set F of coset representatives for G/A:

In these presentations translation generators are denoted by x, y, rotation genera-
tors by ρs, reﬂection generators by σs, and glide reﬂection generators by γs.

Fundamental to what we do is the following, which is the ﬁrst step in the strategy

for determining W(G):

Lemma 2.3. If ϕ ∈ W(G), then ϕ(A) = A. In particular, for g ∈ G we have
ϕ(gA) = ϕ(g)A.

Proof Since ϕ preserves the size of a conjugacy class (Lemma 2.1 (6)), the ﬁrst
statement follows from Lemma 2.2 (iii). The rest follows from Lemma 2.1 (3). (cid:3)

The following indicates the rest of the strategy for determining W(G) (we call

these items the Steps of the proof):

(1) Show that ϕ|A : A → A is an automorphism.
(2) Show that we can compose ϕ with an element of W0(G) so that the resulting
element of W(G) is the identity on A.
(3) Show that we can then compose ϕ with an element of W0(G) so that the resulting
element of W(G) (which we still call ϕ) satisﬁes ϕ(Ag) = Ag for all g ∈ G. This is
the same as showing that ˜ϕ : G/A → G/A is the identity.
(4) Show that we can assume that ϕ ﬁxes each of the elements in F .
(5) Show that for every t ∈ F there is some f = ft ∈ F such that ϕ(at) = af t for
all a ∈ A,
(6) Complete the description of W(G).

The wallpaper group G acts by isometries on the Euclidean space E2; we think
of a wallpaper pattern corresponding to G as a subset of E2 (containing (0, 0)). In
the given presentation of G we have generators x, y of A. Further, for any a ∈ A
there is a translation of E2 by a vector va ∈ E2 (say) corresponding to a. Thus
vx, vy span a lattice L ⊂ E2. We will think of A as identiﬁed with the lattice L:
a = xiyj ∈ A corresponds to va = ivx + jvy ∈ E. The natural action of G on E2
satisﬁes (va)g = vag for a ∈ A, g ∈ G.

Now relative to the metric on E2 we have (closed) balls Br of radius r ≥ 0
centered at (0, 0). Further, each f ∈ F determines an element of the orthogonal
group O(E2), where a 7→ af , and so each conjugacy class aF , a ∈ A, is contained in
the boundary of the ball B|a|.

For any reﬂection or glide reﬂection r ∈ G there is a line of reﬂection L(r) ≤

A, L(r) = {a ∈ A|ar = a}. Given G we let

H = H(G) = {a ∈ A||aG| 6= [G : A]}.

It is easy to see that H is the union of the lines of reﬂection for all reﬂections and
glide reﬂections in G. Since ϕ ∈ W(G) respects the sizes of conjugacy classes we
have:

Lemma 2.4. For any ϕ ∈ W(G) we have ϕ(H) = H.

(cid:3)

Suppose that r ∈ G is a reﬂection or a glide reﬂection. Let L⊥(r) = {a ∈ A|ar =

a−1}. We have:

Lemma 2.5. Suppose r ∈ G is a reﬂection or a glide reﬂection. Let β = r2. Then
for a ∈ A we have (ar)2 = β if and only if a ∈ L⊥(r). In particular, if σ ∈ G is a
reﬂection, then (aσ)2 = 1 if and only if a ∈ L⊥(σ).

Proof. We have (ar)2 = β if and only if ar2 · r−1ar = aβar = β if and only if
aar = 1 if and only if a ∈ L⊥(r).
(cid:3)

For G of type p2mg let β1 = γ2 = 1, β2 = (ργ)2 = y.
For G of type p2gg let β1 = γ2 = x, β2 = (ργ)2 = y.
For G of type p4mg let β1 = γ2 = x, β2 = (ρ2γ)2 = y.
For G of any other type let β1 = β2 = 1.
Let ρθ denote rotation by θ about (0, 0).
Our convention for the commutator (g, h) is g−1h−1gh. For f ∈ G we deﬁne
Kf = {(a, f ) : a ∈ A}. Since (ab, f ) = (a, f )(b, f ) it is easy to see that Kf is a
subgroup of A.

Lemma 2.6. Let f ∈ F . Then
(i) Kf = h(x, f ), (y, f )i.

(ii) [G : Kf ] is ﬁnite if and only if f is a non-trivial rotation. Also Kf = {1} if
and only if f = 1.
(iii) Kf is a non-trivial cyclic group if and only if f is a reﬂection or glide reﬂection
and if f, f ′ are reﬂections or glide reﬂections, then Kf = Kf ′ if and only if f = f ′.

f where C is the centralizer of f in F.
(v) If f is a rotation, then (iv) gives the following:

if G contains ρπ/2;
if G is of type p2mm, p2mg or p2gg;
if G is of type c2mm;
if f = ρπ in G of type p4mg;
otherwise.

if G contains ρπ;
otherwise.

If G has no glide reﬂections this becomes

(af )G ∩ Af =(aKf f ∪ a−1Kf f

if G contains ρπ;
otherwise.

Proof Since A is abelian the Witt-Hall identities ([MKS] p. 290) show that if
a, b ∈ A, then (ab, f ) = (a, f )(b, f ), from which (i) follows. Now (ii) and (iii) follow
from consideration of the speciﬁc groups.

Then (iv) follows because conjugates of the element af result from conjugating
by something in A or something in F. Conjugating by elements in A gives us Kf af .
If (f ′, f ) /∈ A, then (af )f ′
/∈ Af. Thus we only need to conjugate by those f ′ that
satisfy (f ′, f ) ∈ A.

Most of the rest is left to the reader. We will do two cases. First, consider
the group of type p4mm, which contains ρπ/2. The conjugacy class of aρ con-
tains (aρ)x = a(x, ρ−1)ρ and (aρ)y = a(y, ρ−1)ρ, as well as (aρ)ρ = aρρ. Since
(aρ)σ /∈ Aρ we see (aρ)G ∩ Aρ = aKρρ ∪ aρKρρ. Likewise the conjugacy class of
aρ2 contains (aρ2)x = a(x, ρ2)ρ2 and (aρ2)y = a(y, ρ2)ρ2, as well as (aρ2)ρ = aρρ2.
Since (aρ2)σ ∈ aKρ2ρ2 we have (aρ2)G ∩ Aρ2 = aKρ2ρ2 ∪ aρ2
Kρ2 ρ2, proving the
ﬁrst line of (v).

For a second example, suppose γ is a glide reﬂection in a group with a gener-
ator ρ = ρπ. Recall that we deﬁned β1 = γ2, β2 = (ργ)2. Then (aγ)G will in-
clude (aγ)x = a(x, γ−1)γ and (aγ)y = a(y, γ−1)γ, thus it includes aKγγ. Note
that (a, γ) ∈ Kγ implies that (aγ)γ ∈ aKγγ. Lastly we consider (aγ)ρ. Since
γρ = β−1
2 )−1γ. But since β2
2 ∈ Kγ we see that
(aβ1β2)−1Kγγ ⊂ (aγ)G. Thus (aγ)G = aKγγ ∪ (aβ1β2)−1Kγγ.
(cid:3)

1 β2γ, we have (aγ)ρ = (aβ1β−1

§3 Steps (1), (2)

Let ϕ ∈ W(G) where G is a wallpaper group. In this section we will denote A
additively, so that the action of g ∈ G on A by conjugation is denoted (a)g, a ∈ A.
Then for all a, b ∈ A there is some g = ga,b ∈ F such that

(3.1)

Thus

(3.2)

ϕ(a + b) = (ϕ(a) + ϕ(b))ga,b.

ϕ(b) = ϕ(a + b − a) = (ϕ(a + b) + ϕ(−a))ga+b,−a

= (ϕ(a + b) − ϕ(a))ga+b,−a.

Lemma 3.1. For all a, b ∈ A there is f ∈ F such that

ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b)f.

Proof From equation (3.2) we see that f = g−1

a+b,−a will work.

(cid:3)

Let a, b ∈ A. We wish to show that ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b). From equation (3.1)

and Lemma 3.1 we see that

(3.3)

ϕ(a + b) ∈ (ϕ(a) + ϕ(b))F ∩ (ϕ(a) + ϕ(b)F ) ∩ (ϕ(a)F + ϕ(b)).

Since F acts by orthogonal matrices we see that

WEAK CAYLEY TABLE GROUPS OF SOME CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC GROUPS

(i) any point of the form (ϕ(a) + ϕ(b))F is on the circle C1 of radius |ϕ(a) + ϕ(b)|
centered at (0, 0);
(ii) any point of the form ϕ(a) + ϕ(b)F is on the circle C2 of radius |ϕ(b)| centered
at ϕ(a);
(iii) any point of the form ϕ(a)F + ϕ(b) is on the circle C3 of radius |ϕ(a)| centered
at ϕ(b).

The intersection C1 ∩ C2 ∩ C3 certainly contains the point p1 = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b), and
any other possibility for ϕ(a + b). If p1 is the only such point of C1 ∩ C2 ∩ C3, then
by equation (3.3) we must have ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b), and we are done.

So now assume that C1 ∩ C2 ∩ C3 also contains p2 6= p1; then the arc p1p2 has a
perpendicular bisector, L say, that contains the centers of each of C1, C2 and C3.
Thus ϕ(a), ϕ(b) and (0, 0) are on this line, and so p1 = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b) is also on L.

But p1 was on a line perpendicular to L that also contains p2, where the distance
from p1 to L was the same as the distance of p2 to L. It follows that p1 = p2, and
we have a contradiction. Thus ϕ|A is a homomorphism; however ϕ is a bijection,
and so we have shown Step (1):

Lemma 3.2. For any ϕ ∈ W(G) we have ϕ|A : A → A is an automorphism.

(cid:3)

So we may now assume that ϕ|A : A → A is an automorphism. Relative to the
basis vx, vy the matrix representing ϕ|A is an integer matrix, M (ϕ) say, and since
it is invertible M (ϕ) must have determinant ±1. We ﬁrst show:

Lemma 3.3. If G does not have type p1,p2, then ϕ|A has ﬁnite order.

Proof First assume that there is some a ∈ A such that (a)F does not span a cyclic
subgroup of A. Let a1, a2 ∈ (a)F generate a Z2 subgroup. If ϕ|A has inﬁnite order,
then for every N > 0 there is k ∈ N such that some point of ϕk((a)F ) is outside BN .
But all the elements of (a)F are conjugate, and so all the elements of ϕk((a)F ) are
conjugate by Lemma 2.1. Thus if one of the points of ϕk((a)F ) is outside BN , then
they are all outside of BN . Thus ϕ(a1), ϕ(a2) are both on the boundary of the ball
B|ϕ(a1)| ⊃ BN . Now the triangle with vertices (0, 0), a1, a2 is sent to the triangle
with vertices (0, 0), ϕ(a1), ϕ(a2), however (as the distance between ϕ(a1), ϕ(a2) is
at least 1, and we can choose N arbitrarily large) the latter triangle clearly has
larger area than the former, contradicting the fact that M (ϕ) has determinant ±1.

Now one can check (i) and (ii) of the following result:

Lemma 3.4. (i) Every wallpaper group G other then p1 and p2 has some a ∈ A
where (a)F does not span a cyclic group.

(ii) If τ is some isometry of the wallpaper paper pattern in E2 corresponding to
the wallpaper group G and τ ((0, 0)) = (0, 0), then there is some element of W0(G)
whose action on A is equal to that of τ on E2.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.3 now follows from Lemma 3.4 (i).

(cid:3)

Thus by Lemma 3.3 we see that if G is not of type p1,p2, then M (ϕ) is an
integer matrix of ﬁnite order. This order is well-known to be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6, and
the element is an orthogonal rotation or a reﬂection. This matrix also preserves
It thus corresponds to the action of some element of W0(G), by
the lattice L.
Lemma 3.4 (ii). Composing ϕ with the inverse of this element gives a new ϕ where
ϕ|A = IdA, as required for Step (2).

8

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

Thus we now assume that G has type p2.

In this case it is easy to see that

whenever a, b, c, d ∈ Z satisfy ad − bc = ±1, then the assignments

x 7→ xayb,

y 7→ xcyd,

r 7→ r,

determine an automorphism of G. Thus we can compose ϕ with some element of
W0(G) to obtain a new ϕ satisfying ϕ|A = IdA. This gives Step (2):

Proposition 3.5. For ϕ ∈ W(G) there is ϕ′ ∈ W0(G) with (ϕ′ ◦ ϕ)|A = IdA. (cid:3)

§4 Step (3)

Since A ⊳ G we see from Lemma 2.1 that ϕ induces a weak Cayley table iso-
morphism ˜ϕ : G/A → G/A. Now G/A is one of the groups C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, D4 =
C2 × C2, D6, D8, D12. It is known ([Hu]) that each of these groups has trivial weak
Cayley table group.

Lemma 4.1. If G is a wallpaper group having no glide reﬂections in F , with
presentation as given in §2 with generators x, y, ρ, σ, then the assignments

determine an automorphism of G that we denote by ιA.

x 7→ x−1, y 7→ y−1, ρ 7→ ρ, σ 7→ σ,

Proof This follows from the fact that each relation involving x, y has the form (x, y)
or xρ = w = w(x, y) ∈ A, this latter type being equivalent to (x−1)ρ = w(x, y)−1 =
w(x−1, y−1).
(cid:3)

Since ˜ϕ : G/A → G/A is an automorphism or antiautomorphism, we see that if
ρ ∈ G is a rotation that generates the subgroup of rotations ﬁxing (0, 0), then we
must have ˜ϕ(Aρ) = Aρ±1, and so ϕ(ρ) ∈ Aρ±1. If ϕ(ρ) ∈ Aρ−1, then we compose
ϕ with ι and then with ιA, to give a new ϕ which is still the identity on A, but
which satisﬁes ϕ(ρ) ∈ Aρ.

If |G/A| = 2, then ˜ϕ is the identity. So assume that |G/A| > 2.
If G does not have reﬂections or glide reﬂections, then the above shows that ˜ϕ

is the identity.

So now we assume that G has reﬂections, but does not have glide reﬂections.
Then we have G/A ∼= D4 = C2 × C2, D6, D8, D12.
In particular, G has at least
two reﬂection cosets: there are σ1, σ2 ∈ G, Aσ1 6= Aσ2, where σi, i = 1, 2, are
reﬂections. Assume that ϕ(σ1) = aσ2. Since σ1 is a reﬂection, then a ∈ L⊥(σ2)
by Lemma 2.5 and Lemma 2.1 (1). Also, L⊥(σ1) 6= L⊥(σ2), since Aσ1 6= Aσ2.
Then there is b ∈ L⊥(σ1) such that ab /∈ L⊥(σ2). But bσ1 has order 2, however
ϕ(bσ1) ∼ ϕ(b)ϕ(σ1) = baσ2; since ab /∈ L⊥(σ2) we see that abσ2 does not have
order 2, a contradiction. Thus we have proved Step (3) for groups without glide
reﬂections:

Lemma 4.2. If G does not have glide reﬂections in F , then we can assume (by
composing with a trivial weak Cayley table map if necessary) that ϕ|A = IdA and
that ˜ϕ : G/A → G/A is the identity.
(cid:3)

So now assume that G has a glide reﬂection in F. There are four wallpaper groups

of this type which we now consider individually.

If G is of type pg, then |G/A| = 2 and so we certainly have ˜ϕ = IdG/A.
If G is of type p2mg, then G/A ∼= C2

2 , and the cosets are A, Aρ, Aσ, Aρσ. Here
Aρ consists entirely of rotations; if xiyjσ ∈ Aσ, then (xiyjσ)2 = x2i; and if xiyjρσ ∈

WEAK CAYLEY TABLE GROUPS OF SOME CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC GROUPS

9

Aρσ, then (xiyjρσ)2 = y2j+1. This shows that ϕ(Aρ) = Aρ. If we have ϕ(σ) =
xiyjρσ, then σ2 = 1 gives (xiyjρσ)2 = 1, so that y2j+1 = 1, a contradiction. Thus
we have ˜ϕ = IdG/A.

If G is of type p2gg, then G/A ∼= C2

2 , and the cosets are A, Aρ, Aγ, Aργ. Again
Aρ consists entirely of order 2 rotations, while each element of Aγ, Aργ is a glide
reﬂection and so not of order 2. Thus we have ϕ(Aρ) = Aρ. If ϕ(γ) = xiyjργ, then

x = ϕ(x) = ϕ(γ2) ∼ (xiyjργ)2 = xiyjργxiyjργ

= xiyjργρx−iy−jγ = xiyjyγ−1x−iy−jγ = y2j+1.

Thus y2j+1 ∈ xG = {x, x−1}, a contradiction. Thus we have ˜ϕ = IdG/A.

If G is of type p4mg, then G/A ∼= D8. We describe W(G/A). Order the cosets

of G/A as

A, Aρ2, Aρ2γ, Aγ, Aργ, Aρ3γ, Aρ3, Aρ.

Then relative to this ordering the action of W(G/A) is given by the permutation
group h(3, 5, 4, 6), (3, 4), (7, 8)i ∼= D8 × C2.

Thus the possibilities for ˜ϕ(Aρ) are Aρ, Aρ3; we also see that ϕ(Aρ2) = Aρ2, and
that {Aγ, Aργ, Aρ2γ, Aρ3γ} are permuted by ˜ϕ. If ϕ(Aρ) = Aρ3, then composing
with ι and then ψ2 shows that we can assume ϕ|A = IdA, ˜ϕ(Aρ) = Aρ, ˜ϕ(Aρ2) =
Aρ2, ˜ϕ(Aρ3) = Aρ3.

Considering the other cosets we have:

(xiyjγ)2 = x2i+1;
(xiyjρ2γ)2 = y2j+1;

(xiyjργ)2 = xi−j yj−i;

(xiyjρ3γ)2 = (xy)i+j+1.

This shows that Aργ, Aρ3γ are the only cosets that contain involutions, so that
we must have {ϕ(Aργ), ϕ(Aρ3γ)} = {Aργ, Aρ3γ}. This shows that the action of ˜ϕ
is given by some element of the group h(3, 4), (5, 6)i. If ˜ϕ 6= 1, then we must either
have ϕ(Aγ) = Aρ2γ or ϕ(Aργ) = Aρ3γ.
CASE 1: We ﬁrst show that we cannot have ϕ(Aγ) = Aρ2γ. So assume that this
is the case, and that ϕ(γ) = xuyvρ2γ. Since γ2 = x we have

x = ϕ(x) = ϕ(γ2) ∼ (xuyvρ2γ)2 = xuyvρ2γ · xuyvρ2γ

= xuyv(ρ2γρ2)x−uy−vγ = xuyv(yγ−1)x−uy−vγ = xuyvyx−uyv = y2v+1.

Since xG = {x, y, x−1, y−1} we see that 2v + 1 ∈ {1, −1}, so that v ∈ {0, −1}.

The next result follows from the presentation for G of type p4mg:

Lemma 4.3. Let G have type p4mg. Let X = hx2i, Y = hy2i. For a ∈ A we have

(aρ2γ)G = yY aρ3

γ ∪ x−1Y aργ ∪ Xaρ2γ ∪ xy−1Xaγρ2γ. (cid:3)

Now (xγ)2 = x3, giving x3 = ϕ(x3) = ϕ((xγ)2) ∼ ϕ(xγ)2 ∼ (ϕ(x)ϕ(γ))2, so that
x3 ∼ (xu+1yvρ2γ)2. Lemma 4.3 shows that (xu+1yvρ2γ)G has one of the following
forms, for some k ∈ Z:

(i) y2k+1y−u−1xvγ;
(iii) x2kxuyvρ2γ;

(ii) x−1y2kyu+1x−vγ;

(iv) x2k+1y−1xu+1y−vρ2γ.

If we have (i), then
x3 ∼ (y2k+1y−u−1xvγ)2 = y2k−uxvγ · y2k−uxvγ = y2k−uxvγ2y−2k+uxv = x2v+1,

which is a contradiction since v ∈ {0, −1}.

10

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

If we have (ii), then x3 ∼ (y2k+u+1x−v−1γ)2, where

(y2k+u+1x−v−1γ)2 = y2k+u+1x−v−1γ · y2k+u+1x−v−1γ

= y2k+u+1x−v−1γ2 · y−2k−u−1x−v−1 = x−2v−1,

which is a contradiction since v ∈ {0, −1}.

If we have (iii), then x3 ∼ (x2k+uyvρ2γ)2, where

(x2k+uyvρ2γ)2 = x2k+uyvρ2γ · x2k+uyvρ2γ = x2k+uyvρ2γρ2x−2k−uy−vγ

= x2k+uyvyγ−1x−2k−uy−vγ = y2v+1,

which is a contradiction since v ∈ {0, −1}.

If we have (iv), then x3 ∼ (x2k+2+uyvρ2γ)2, where

(x2k+2+uyvρ2γ)2 = x2k+2+uyvρ2γ · x2k+2+uyvρ2γ = x2k+2+uyvρ2γρ2x−2k−2−uy−vγ

= x2k+2+uyvyγ−1x−2k−2−uy−vγ = y2v+1,

which is a contradiction since v ∈ {0, −1}. Thus CASE 1 does not happen.

CASE 2: Here we assume that ϕ(Aργ) = Aρ3γ and write ϕ(ργ) = bρ3γ, b = xuyv.
Since (ργ)2 = 1 we must have (bρ3γ)2 = 1. But

(bρ3γ)2 = xuyvρ3γ · xuyvρ3γ = xuyvρ3γρ3y−uxvσ = xuyvyγy−uxvσ

= xuyv+1s2yuxv = (xy)u+v+1,

so that u + v + 1 = 0.

Now (xyργ)2 = 1, and so 1 = ϕ((xyργ)2) ∼ ϕ(xyργ)2, so that ϕ(xyργ)2 = 1.
But ϕ(xyργ) ∼ xy · xuyvρ3σ, and so we must have (xu+1yv+1ρ3σ)2 = 1. One ﬁnds
that (xu+1yv+1ρ3σ)2 = (xy)u+v+3, so that u + v + 3 = 0, a contradiction.

Thus CASE 2 does not happen either, and we have proved Step (3).

§5 Step (4)

We need to show that we can assume (after possibly composing ϕ with an element
of W0(G) or a known non-trivial weak Cayley table isomorphism) that ϕ ﬁxes each
element of F . We do this in such a way as to preserve the fact that ϕ|A is the
identity on A, and that ˜ϕ is the identity map on cosets of A. We consider each
type of wallpaper group.

p2, p3, p4, p6 cases: Here we have ϕ(ρ) = aρ, a ∈ A; however the assign-
ment (x, y, ρ) 7→ (x, y, aρ) determines an automorphism of G in this case. To see
this we note that, by the classiﬁcation of isometry types, aρ is either a rotation,
a translation, a reﬂection or a glide reﬂection, the last three options not being
possible. We thus compose ϕ with the inverse of this automorphism to obtain
ϕ(ρ) = ρ, ϕ(ρ−1) = ρ−1. This then does the cases p2, p3.

xiyj ∈ A. But then composing ϕ with τ −i

x τ −j

For p4 we note that ϕ(ρ2) ∼ ϕ(ρ)2 = ρ2, which shows that ϕ(ρ2) = (ρ2)a, a =
y will then give ϕ(ρi) = ρi, 0 ≤ i < 4.
For p6 we note that ϕ(ρ2) ∼ ϕ(ρ)2 = ρ2, which shows that ϕ(ρ2) = (ρ2)a, a =
xiyj ∈ A. Thus ϕ(ρ2) = (xy)k(xy−2)mρ2 for some k, m ∈ Z. But now we can
compose ϕ with τ −k
xy−2 so as to be able to assume ϕ(ρ2) = ρ2, ϕ(ρ−2) = ρ−2.
Now ϕ(ρ3) ∼ ϕ(ρ)ϕ(ρ2) = ρ3, so that ϕ(ρ) = x2iy2jρ3, i, j ∈ Z. Now one can use
x2 µ−j
µ−i

y2 so as to be able to assume ϕ(ρ3) = ρ3. This does the p6 case.

cm, pm cases: Here we must have ϕ(σ) = aσ, a ∈ A, where (aσ)2 = 1 since σ2 = 1;
however the assignment (x, y, σ) 7→ (x, y, aσ) determines an automorphism of G in
these cases, and we are done.
pg case: Here we note that x = γ2 is central in G, so that we must have ϕ(γ)2 = x;
one ﬁnds that if ϕ(γ) = xuyvγ, then u = 0. Thus we can compose with a power of
the automorphism ψy of G so as to get ϕ|A = Id and ϕ(γ) = γ.

We will ﬁnd the following useful in what follows:

Lemma 5.1. Suppose that ϕ|A = IdA and that ϕ(ρ) = ρ for a rotation ρ. Suppose
that σ, σρ are distinct reﬂections in G with ϕ(Aσ) = Aσ. Then ϕ(σ) = σ.

Proof Since ϕ(Aσ) = Aσ we can write ϕ(σ) = aσ, a ∈ A. Since σ2 = 1 we must
have a ∈ L⊥(σ). Now ϕ(ρ · σ) ∼ ρaσ = aρ−1
∈ L⊥(ρσ). But then
a ∈ L⊥(σρ). Since σ 6= σρ we have a ∈ L⊥(σ)∩L⊥(σρ) = {1}, and we are done. (cid:3)

ρσ and so aρ−1

Lemma 5.2. Let ϕ|A = Id|A and assume ϕ(Aγ) = Aγ for some glide reﬂection
coset Aγ. Then ϕ(γ) = aγ implies that a ∈ L⊥(γ).

Let β = γ2, so that β ∈ L(γ), β 6= 1. Squaring both sides of ϕ(γ) = aγ
Proof.
gives us β ∼ βaaγ. Since β and aaγ both lie on L(γ), this implies that βaaγ = β±1.
Then we have two possibilities: either aaγ = 1 which implies that a ∈ L⊥(γ), or
aaγ = β−2 in which case a ∈ β−1L⊥(γ). Now let L⊥(γ) = hαi, α ∈ A, and suppose
we have a = β−1αk. Then ϕ(β · γ) ∼ β · aγ = αkγ. Since (βγ)2 = β3, squaring both
sides gives β3 ∼ β which is a contradiction. Thus we must have a ∈ L⊥(γ).
(cid:3)

Lemma 5.3. Let G be a wallpaper group with a reﬂection or glide reﬂection coset
Ar. Assume ϕ|A = IdA and ϕ(Ar) = Ar. Suppose that for ar ∈ Ar, we have
ϕ(ar) ∼ ar. Then ϕ(ar) ∈ Krar. In particular, ar = ϕ(r) ∼ r implies that a ∈ Kr.

If ρπ /∈ G, then by Lemma 2.6 we have (ar)G ∩ Ar = Krar and we are
Proof.
done, so suppose ρπ ∈ G. Let λ = (ρπ, r−1), so that λ ∈ A and rρπ = λr. Let
β = r2 so that r = βr−1. (If r is a reﬂection then β = 1.) Thus, again by Lemma
2.6 we have

(ar)G ∩ Ar = Krar ∪ Kr(ar)ρπ = Krar ∪ Kra−1λr.

First we note that if λ = 1 and a2 ∈ Kr, then we have nothing to prove; so
suppose that this is not the case. Since ϕ(Ar) = Ar it suﬃces to show that
ϕ(ar) /∈ Kr(ar)ρπ . Now Kr is a cyclic group: Kr = hαi, where α ∈ A. Also in this
case one sees that Kr ≤ L⊥(r). Suppose to the contrary that ϕ(ar) = αi(ar)ρπ for
some αi ∈ Kr. Then for any b ∈ A we have

ϕ(b · ar) ∼ bαia−1λr.

Squaring both sides we have

ϕ(bar)2 ∼ ϕ((bar)2) = ϕ(baβ(ba)r) = baβ(ba)r ∼ (bαia−1λβ)(bαia−1λ)r.

Reordering the elements this becomes

βaarbbr ∼ βαi(αi)ra−1(a−1)rbbrλλr.

(5.1)
Recall that L(r) is the line ﬁxed by the action of r. Note that aar is in L(r) (since
(aar)r = ara = aar.) Similarly bbr, λλr ∈ L(r). Recall that α ∈ Kr ≤ L⊥(r), so that
αr = α−1. So we know αi(αi)r = 1. Also, β ∈ L(r) (since βr = (r2)r = r2 = β).

12

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

Thus Equation (5.1) is stating that two elements of L(r) are conjugate to each
other. This implies that they are equal or they are inverses. If they are inverses of
each other, Equation (5.1) becomes b−2(b−2)r = β2λλr which can’t be true for all
b ∈ A. If they are equal to each other, we have a2(a2)r = λλr. We can assume λ
is not trivial in this case because if λ = 1, then a2 ∈ Kr, and we assumed both of
those cannot be true together.

So assume λ 6= 1. Now the fact that G has a reﬂection or glide reﬂection r,
contains ρπ, and λ = (ρπ, r−1) 6= 1, restricts us to the groups of type p2mg, p2gg,
p4mg. In these cases one checks that a2(a2)r ∈ hx4, y4i. However (looking at the
possible λs in each of these three groups) we ﬁnd that λλr /∈ hx4, y4i. This is a
contradiction. Thus ϕ(ar) /∈ Kr(ar)r.
(cid:3)

c2mm case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ, ϕ(σ) = xiyjσ. Then the fact that (ρσ)2 =
1 implies that 1 = ϕ((ρσ)2) = ϕ(ρσ)2 = (ϕ(ρ)ϕ(σ))2 = (xuyvρxiyjσ)2, which is
only true when u + j = i + v, so that we can compose ϕ with the inverse of ψu,v,i,j
to get ϕ(ρ) = ρ, ϕ(σ) = σ. To get ϕ(ρσ) = ρσ we now apply Lemma 5.1, and we
are done.

p2mm case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ, ϕ(σ) = xiyjσ. We can compose ϕ with
the inverse of ψu,v to get ϕ(ρ) = ρ. To get ϕ(σ) = σ and ϕ(ρσ) = ρσ we now apply
Lemma 5.1, and we are done.

p2mg case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ. Composing with a power of ψy and then
a power of ψx we can arrange that v = 0 and u = 0. Let ϕ(σ) = aσ. The fact that
σ2 = 1 gives a ∈ L⊥(σ). In this group this implies ϕ(σ) ∼ σ and we may apply
Lemma 5.3 to give a ∈ Kσ. If ϕ(ρσ) = bρσ, then Lemma 5.2 gives b ∈ L⊥(ρσ).
Since (cρσ)G = hx2iacρσ ∪hx2i(cy)−1ρσ, L⊥(ρσ) = hx2i and bρσ = ϕ(ρ·σ) ∼ aρρσ,
we see aρ lies on L⊥(ρσ) ∪ y−1L⊥(ρσ). Thus a lies on (L⊥(ρσ) ∪ yL⊥(ρσ)) ∩ Kσ.
Hence a = 1, which gives us ϕ(ρσ) ∼ ρσ, and so by Lemma 5.3 we know b ∈ Kρσ.
Now σ = ϕ(ρ · ρσ) ∼ bρσ which tells us b ∈ L⊥(σ), and so b is also trivial.

p2gg case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ. By using ψx, ψy we can arrange that
u = v = 0. Let ϕ(γ) = aγ, ϕ(ργ) = bργ. By Lemma (5.2) a ∈ L⊥(γ). Note that
L⊥(γ) contains elements from only two conjugacy classes, namely γG and (yγ)G. If
aγ ∼ yγ then we may compose with ψ◦ι. So now we have ϕ(γ) ∼ γ and so by Lemma
5.3 a ∈ Kγ. Lemma 5.2 gives us b ∈ L⊥(ργ) and thus bργ = ϕ(ρ · γ) ∼ ρaγ = a−1ργ
implies that a ∈ L⊥(ργ) ∪ yL⊥(ργ). This intersects Kγ trivially hence ϕ(γ) = γ.

Now ϕ(ρ · γ) ∼ ργ so we may apply Lemma 5.3 which gives us b ∈ Kργ. We also
know γ = ϕ(ρ · ργ) ∼ b−1γ which tells us b ∈ Kγ ∪ xyKγ. The only possibility then
is that b = 1.

p3m1 case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ. Composing with an element of hψ1, Ixi
we can arrange that ϕ(ρ) = ρ. Thus ϕ(ρ) = ρ, ϕ(ρ2) = ρ2. We now apply Lemma
5.1 to conclude that ϕ(σ) = σ, ϕ(ρσ) = ρσ, ϕ(ρ2σ) = ρ2σ, and we are done.

p31m case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ, ϕ(σ) = xiyjσ. Here we note that by
composing with an element of hIx, Iyi we can arrange that ϕ(ρ) = ρ, so that
ϕ(ρ2) = ρ2. From Lemma 5.1 we obtain ϕ(ρkσ) = ρkσ, k = 0, 1, 2, as required.

p4mm case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ, ϕ(σ) = xiyjγ. Then acting by some
Ib, b ∈ A, we can assume ϕ(ρ) ∈ {ρ, yρ}. If we have ϕ(ρ) = yρ, then acting by

13

the automorphism ψ−1
ϕ(ρkσ) = ρkσ, 0 ≤ k ≤ 3.

1 we see that ϕ(ρ) = ρ, ϕ(ρ3) = ρ3. Now Lemma 5.1 gives

Let ϕ(ρ2) = xiyjρ2. Then for any reﬂection t ∈ {σ, ρσ, ρ2σρ3σ} we have ρ2t =
ϕ(ρ2t) ∼ ϕ(ρ2)ϕ(t) = xiyjρ2t, from which we see that xiyj ∈ L⊥(ρ2t) for all t.
This gives i = j = 0 and so we have ϕ(ρ) = ρ, ϕ(ρ2) = ρ2, ϕ(ρ3) = ρ3, ϕ(σ) = σ.
By Lemma 5.1 we have ϕ(ρσ) = ρσ, ϕ(ρ2σ) = ρ2σ, ϕ(ρ3σ) = ρ3σ.

So let ϕ(ρ2σ) = xaybρ2σ. Then ρ2+kσ = ϕ(ρ2+kσ) = ϕ(ρ2 · ρkσ) ∼ xaybρ2+kσ
gives xayb ∈ L⊥(ρ2+kσ) for 0 ≤ k < 4. It follows that a = b = 0, and this concludes
this case.
p6m case: Suppose that ϕ(ρ) = xuyvρ, ϕ(σ) = xiyjγ. Then acting by some Ib, b ∈
A, we can assume that ϕ(ρ) = ρ. Now Lemma 5.1 gives ϕ(ρkσ) = ρkσ, 0 ≤ k ≤ 5,
and the rest of the proof follows as in the previous case. This completes this case
and concludes the proof of Step (4).

§6 Steps (5) and (6)

Lemma 6.1. Suppose that ϕ|A = IdA and t ∈ G where ϕ(t) = t. If a ∈ A where
ϕ(at) = bt, then a ∼ b.

Proof Given the hypotheses we have:

a ∼ at = ϕ(at) = ϕ(t−1 · at) ∼ ϕ(t−1) · ϕ(at) = t−1bt ∼ b. (cid:3)

Recall that F is a set of coset representatives for G/A. In the situation of Lemma

6.1 we will write ϕ(at) = arat, where ra ∈ F .

Proposition 6.2. Suppose that ϕ|A = IdA and t ∈ G where ϕ(t) = t. Then there
is f ∈ F such that ϕ(at) = af t for all a ∈ A.

Proof From Lemma 2.1 we see that ϕ(At) = At. Now for a, b ∈ A we have
ab−1 = at(bt)−1 = ϕ(at · (bt)−1) ∼ arat · t−1(brb)−1 = ara(brb )−1.

Thus there is some f ∈ F such that ab−1 = (ara(brb )−1)f , so that letting α =
raf, β = rbf we have

(6.1)

a(a−1)α = b(b−1)β.

For a ∈ A we let Ca denote the circle in E2 that contains the origin and that is
centered at va, and let Sa = {va(a−1)f : f ∈ F }. Then Sa consists of |aG| points
that lie on Ca. Note that (0, 0) ∈ Sa for all a ∈ A. Since two distinct circles can
meet in at most two points equation (6.1) gives |Sa ∩ Sb| ∈ {1, 2}.

Lemma 6.3. (i) If |Sa ∩ Sb| = 1, then there is δ ∈ F such that ara = aδ, brb = bδ.
(ii) If (0, 0), va, vb are collinear, then there is a δ ∈ F such that ara = aδ, brb = bδ.

Proof (i) If |Sa ∩ Sb| = 1, then Sa ∩ Sb = {(0, 0)} and so from equation (6.1)
we get a(a−1)α = b(b−1)β = 1, so that a = aα, b = bβ. From this we obtain
af −1

= brb, so that we can let δ = f −1.

= ara, bf −1

(ii) We may assume that a 6= b. Since (0, 0), va, vb are collinear the centers of the
circles Ca, Cb are on the line through these points. Since a 6= b we have Ca 6= Cb;
since (0, 0) is common to Ca and Cb we see that Ca 6= Cb implies Ca ∩ Cb =
{(0, 0)}. This gives a = aα, b = bβ, which then implies af −1
= brb, as
required.
(cid:3)

= ara, bf −1

14

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

Lemma 6.4. Let b /∈ H. Then for all a ∈ A there is a unique f = fa,b ∈ F such
that ϕ(at) = af t, ϕ(bt) = bf t.

Proof Recall that b /∈ H means that |bG| = |F |. If (0, 0), va, vb are collinear, then
the existence of such a δ ∈ F follows from Lemma 6.3 (ii), while the uniqueness
follows from the fact that b /∈ H.

Now assume that (0, 0), va, vb are not collinear. If |Sa ∩ Sb| = 1, then by Lemma
6.3 (i) there is δ ∈ F such that ara = aδ, brb = bδ, and the fact that δ is unique
follows from b /∈ H. So now assume that |Sa∩Sb| = 2. Then by Lemma 6.3 (ii) there
is some f ∈ F such that for all k ∈ N we have (bk)f = (bk)rbk . Since b /∈ H this
element f is unique. Since Sa is ﬁnite there is some k ∈ N such that |Sa ∩ Sbk | = 1;
, ara = ah′
then we have h, h′ ∈ F with brb = bh, brbk = (bk)h and brbk = (bk)h′
.
Since b /∈ H we again see that h, h′ are unique, so that h = h′. Thus we have
ara = ah and brb = bh, as required.
(cid:3)

Now let a, b, c ∈ A where b /∈ H. Then by Lemma 6.4 there are unique f, h ∈ F
such that ϕ(at) = af t, ϕ(bt) = bf t and ϕ(bt) = bht, ϕ(ct) = cht. Since f, h are
unique and ϕ(bt) = bf t, ϕ(bt) = bht we must have f = h; it follows (by ﬁxing a and
varying c) that for all d ∈ A we must have ϕ(dt) = df t for this value of f ∈ F that
is completely determined by b /∈ H. This concludes the proof of Proposition 6.2,
and so completes Step (5).

For the remainder of this section we assume that ϕ|A = IdA and that ϕ(f ) = f
for all f ∈ F . We also assume that for all f ∈ F there is rf such that ϕ(af ) = arf f
for all a ∈ A. Our goal will be to reduce to the situation where ϕ(af ) = af for all
f ∈ F, a ∈ A. We start with:

Lemma 6.5. For all a ∈ A and all reﬂections or glide reﬂections r ∈ F we have
ϕ(ar) ∈ {ar, arr}.

Since ar ∼ ϕ(a · r) we may apply Lemma 5.3. This gives us ϕ(ar) = atr ∈
Proof.
Krar for some t ∈ F. This implies that a−1at ∈ Kr for all a ∈ A. But a−1at = (a, t)
and Kt = {(a, t) : a ∈ A} shows that Kt ⊂ Kr. From Lemma 2.6 (iii) it follows
that either Kt = {1} or Kt = Kr, from which we see that either t = 1 or t = r. (cid:3)

The following applies to the groups of type p4mm, p4mg, p31m, p3m1, p6m.

Theorem 6.6. Let G be a wallpaper group having a nontrivial rotation ρ 6= ρπ, and
distinct reﬂection or glide reﬂection cosets Ar, Arρ. Suppose we have ϕ|A = IdA,
ϕ(r) = r, ϕ(rρ) = rρ, and ϕ(ρ) = ρ. Then ϕ|Ar = IdAr .

Proof. Recall from Lemma 2.6 that for any of these ﬁve groups we have

(ar)G ∩ Ar ⊆ Krar ∪ Kr(aβ1β2)−1r,

where β1β2 = xy when G is of type p4mg, but is trivial otherwise. Suppose to the
contrary that ϕ|Ar 6= IdAr. Then by Lemma 6.5 we must have ϕ(ar) = arr for all
a ∈ A. Now rρ is also a reﬂection or a glide reﬂection, and so we have:

arr · ρ ∼ ϕ(ar · ρ) = ϕ(a · rρ) ∼ arρ.

Thus for all a ∈ A we must have (i) ara−1 ∈ Krρ, or (ii) ara ∈ Krρ(β1β2)−1. Since
r and rρ are distinct reﬂections, case (i) is only true for a which satisfy ara−1 = 1.
Any such a ∈ A must lie on L(r). Since ρ 6= ρπ, L(r) and Krρ are not parallel.
Hence L(r) ∩ Krρ(β1β2)−1 is exactly one point. (If G is of type p4mg and r = ργ
this point is xy−1, when r = ρ2γ it is y−2, and when r = ρ3γ it is x−1y−1. In all

WEAK CAYLEY TABLE GROUPS OF SOME CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC GROUPS

15

other cases, this point is trivial.) Thus case (ii) is only true for a ∈ L⊥(r)y−1 or
a ∈ L⊥(r). This shows that the only a ∈ A that satisfy arrρ ∼ arρ are in the union
of two lines (either L(r) ∪ L⊥(r) or L(r) ∪ L⊥(r)y−1) which is not all of A. Thus
ϕ(ar) = arr is not possible. We conclude that ϕ|Ar = Id.
(cid:3)

The following applies to the eight groups c2mm, p2mm, p2mg, p2gg, p4mm,

p4mg, p31m, p3m1, and p6mm.

Theorem 6.7. Let G be a wallpaper group having at least two cosets that are
reﬂection or glide reﬂection cosets. Suppose we have ϕ|A = IdA and ϕ|Aσ = Id
for all reﬂection cosets Aσ as well as ϕ|Aγ = Id for all glide reﬂection cosets Aγ.
Assume ϕ(t) = t for all t ∈ F . Then ϕ = Id.

Proof Let Ar denote a reﬂection or glide reﬂection coset. Let Aρk be a rotation
coset. We know by Proposition 6.2 that there is some t ∈ F such that ϕ(aρk) = atρk
for all a ∈ A. By hypothesis we have ϕ(ra−1) = ra−1 which gives

r · ρk ∼ ϕ(r · ρk) = ϕ(ra−1 · aρk) ∼ ra−1 · atρk = (a−1at)r · rρk.

(The last equality is true because the action of r is the same as the action of r−1.)
This gives (a−1at)r ∈ Krρk ∪ Krρk (β1β2)−1 for all a ∈ A. Write βr = ((β1β2)−1)r−1
so that (a, t) ∈ Kρkr ∪ Kρkrβr for all a ∈ A. Now the element t ∈ F depends upon
k and not on r. Then the fact that we have at least two reﬂection or glide reﬂection

cosets, say r, r′ ∈ F means that (a, t) ∈ (cid:0)Kρkr ∪ Kρkrβr(cid:1) ∩(cid:0)Kρkr′ ∪ Kρkr′βr′(cid:1).

This intersection is trivial if neither r nor r′ are glide reﬂections. Otherwise, this
intersection is ﬁnite and therefore bounded. Thus there exists a t ∈ F such that
for all a ∈ A, we must have (a, t) in this small intersection. This can only be true
if t is trivial. So ϕ(aρk) = aρk. This completes the proof.
(cid:3)

The group of type c2mm By Lemma 6.5 there are s ∈ {1, σ}, u ∈ {1, ρσ}, where
ϕ(aσ) = asσ, ϕ(aρσ) = auρσ for all a ∈ A. If we have u = ρσ, we may compose
with ψ ◦ ι so that we have u = 1. If s = σ, then we have

xyρ ∼ ϕ(xy · ρ) = ϕ(xσ · xρσ) ∼ yσxρσ = y2ρ.

Since xyρ ≁ y2ρ, this is not possible so we must have s = 1. Theorem 6.7 now shows
that ϕ(aρ) = aρ for all a ∈ A, and so G has trivial weak Cayley table group.
(cid:3)

The group of type p2mm

By Lemma 6.5 there are s ∈ {1, σ}, u ∈ {1, ρσ}, where ϕ(aσ) = asσ, ϕ(aρσ) =
auρσ for all a ∈ A. If we have s = σ, we may compose with τ so that we have s = 1.
Now note that τ ψ is the identity on A ∪ Aσ and conjugates elements of Aρ ∪ Aρσ
by ρσ. This, if we now have u = ρσ, then we compose with τ ψ to obtain s = 1, u = 1.
Theorem 6.7 now shows that ϕ(aρ) = aρ for all a ∈ A. This shows that groups G
of type p2mm have weak Cayley table group generated by W0(G) and τ .
(cid:3)

The group of type p2mg By Lemma 6.5 we know that ϕ(aσ) = asσ, and ϕ(aρσ) =
auρσ for some s ∈ {1, σ}, u ∈ {1, ρσ}, for all a ∈ A. Now if s = σ, then

ρσ = ϕ(ρσ) = ϕ(yσ · ρ) ∼ ysσρ = ysy−1ρσ = y−2ρσ,

which contradicts Lemma 2.6. Thus s = 1.

Next, if u = ρσ, then

xσ = ϕ(xσ) = ϕ(xσρ · ρ) = ϕ(xy−1ρσ · ρ) ∼ (xy−1)uρσρ = (xy−1)uyσ,

16

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

so that (xy−1)uy = x−1y−1y = x−1 has the form xy2k or x−1y2ky−1, both of which
are not possible. Thus u = 1. Theorem 6.7 now shows that ϕ(aρ) = aρ for all
a ∈ A, and so G has trivial weak Cayley table group.
(cid:3)

The group p2gg By Proposition 6.2 there are s, u ∈ F = {1, ρ, γ, ργ} such that
ϕ(aγ) = asγ, and ϕ(aργ) = auργ for all a ∈ A. By Lemma 6.5 we know s ∈
{1, γ}, u ∈ {1, ργ}. Let X = hx2i, Y = hy2i. Then for G a group of type p2gg we
have

Lemma 6.8. Let a, b ∈ A. Then
(i) aγ ∼ bγ if and only if ab−1 ∈ Y or ab ∈ x−1yY .
(ii) aργ ∼ bργ if and only if ab−1 ∈ X or ab ∈ xy−1X.
(iii) If v ∈ F and a ∈ A, then aav /∈ x−1yY ∪ xy−1X.

Proof (i) and (ii) follow from the presentation. For (iii) note that for a = xiyj we
have aρ = a−1, aγ = xiy−j, aργ = x−iyj, which gives (iii).
(cid:3)

Now for all a ∈ A we have:

(a−1)γuργ = aργuργ = ϕ(aργ ργ) = ϕ((aργ)ργ ) ∼ ϕ(aργ) ∼ ϕ(ργ · a)

= ϕ(ρaγ−1

γ) = ϕ(ρ · aγγ) ∼ ρ(aγ)sγ = aγsρργ = (a−1)γsργ.

From Lemma 6.8 (ii), (iii), we thus get as(a−1)u ∈ X for all a ∈ A. Let a = xiyj,
and recall that u ∈ {1, ργ}. We show that this implies s = 1, for if s = γ, then
the possibility u = 1 gives as(a−1)u = (xiy−j)(x−iy−j) = y−2j /∈ X; while u = ργ
gives as(a−1)u = (xiy−j)(xiy−j) = x2iy−2j /∈ X. Thus we have s = 1.

Similarly, for all a ∈ A we have:

aγγ = ϕ(aγγ) = ϕ(ρ · aργργ) ∼ ρaργuργ = aγuγ,

from which we obtain (a−1)γaγu ∈ Y for all a ∈ A; or a−1au ∈ Y for all a ∈ A.
However, if u = ργ, then x−1xργ = x−2, a contradiction. Thus u = 1.
(cid:3)

Theorem 6.7 now shows that ϕ(aρ) = aρ for all a ∈ A, and so any G of type
(cid:3)

p2gg has trivial weak Cayley table group.

Using the above cases, Theorem 6.6 and Theorem 6.7 we see that

Corollary 6.9. Each group of type c2mm, p2mg, p2gg, p4mm, p31m, p3m1,
p6mm has trivial weak Cayley table group.
(cid:3)

The group p2

We have ϕ|A = IdA and that there is some t ∈ F such that ϕ(aρ) = atρ for all

a ∈ A. If t = 1, then ϕ = id, while if t = ρ, then ϕ = Iρι, and we have proved

Corollary 6.10. The group of type p2 has trivial weak Cayley table group.

(cid:3)

Lemma 6.11. Let G be one of the groups of type p3, p4, p6 (respectively), and
let d = 3, 4, 6 (respectively). Suppose that ρ ∈ F is a rotation of order d, and that
there are s, t ∈ F with ϕ(aρ) = atρ, ϕ(ar−1) = asρ−1 for all a ∈ A. Then s = t.

Proof Given a ∈ A, let aρd−1 = (bρ)−1, b ∈ A. Then solving gives b = (a−1)ρ2
Since (t, ρ) = 1 we have:

.

ϕ(aρd−1) = ϕ(bρ)−1 = (btρ)−1 = ρ−1(b−1)t = ρ−1(aρ−1

)t = atρd−1 (cid:3)

The group p3

WEAK CAYLEY TABLE GROUPS OF SOME CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC GROUPS

17

We know that ϕ|A = IdA and that there is t ∈ F = {1, ρ, ρ2} such that ϕ(aρ) =
atρ for all a ∈ A. By Lemma 6.11 we have ϕ(aρ2) = atρ2 for all a ∈ A. Thus ϕ is
a power of the weak Cayley table isomorphism τ deﬁned in §2, and we have proved

Corollary 6.12. The group of type p3 has weak Cayley table group generated by
W0(G) and τ .
(cid:3)

The group p4

We know that ϕ|A = IdA and that there is some t ∈ F = hρi such that ϕ(aρ) =
atρ for all a ∈ A. By Lemma 6.11 we have ϕ(aρ3) = atρ3 for all a ∈ A. If t = 1,
then ϕ|Aρ∪Aρ3 = id. If t = ρk, then composing with µ−k
reduces to the case where
ϕ|Aρ∪Aρ3 = id, also.

Now there is u ∈ F such that ϕ(aρ2) = auρ2 for all a ∈ A. If u = ρ2, then we can
compose with τρ2 to obtain ϕ = id. Thus the remaining case reduces to u = ρ. In
this situation one has ϕ(x2ρ2) = (x2)ρρ2 = y2ρ2, while ϕ(x·xρ2) ∼ x·xρρ2 = x·yρ2,
giving y2ρ2 ∼ xyρ2, a contradiction. This gives

ρ

Corollary 6.13. The group of type p4 has weak Cayley table group generated by
W0(G) and τx, τy, τρ2 , µρ.
(cid:3)

The group p6

We know that ϕ|A = IdA and that there is some t ∈ F = hρi such that ϕ(aρ) =
atρ for all a ∈ A. By Lemma 6.11 we have ϕ(aρ5) = atρ5 for all a ∈ A. Similarly,
there is s ∈ F such that if ϕ(aρ2) = asρ2 for all a ∈ A, then we also have ϕ(aρ4) =
asρ4 for all a ∈ A. Lastly, assume that ϕ(aρ3) = auρ3 for all a ∈ A.

Now using an element of hτρ2 Iρ2 , µρ3 Iρ3 i we can reduce to the case where t = 1

while preserving the conditions ϕ|A = IdA, ϕ(ρk) = ρk, 0 ≤ k < 6.

Lemma 6.14. Assume that for some t ∈ hρi we have a−1at ∈ Kρ2 ∩ Kρ3 for all
a ∈ A. Then t = 1.

Proof If a = y then {a−1av : v ∈ hρi} = {1, x−1, x−1y−1, xy−2, xy−1, y−2}. Now

Kρ2 = h(x, ρ2), (y, ρ2)i = hx−2y, xyi and Kρ3 = hx2, y2i,

so that Kρ2 ∩ Kρ3 = hx2y2, x2y−4i. But the only element of {1, x−1, x−1y−1, xy−2,
xy−1, y−2} that is also in Kρ2 ∩ Kρ3 is the identity, and so we are done.
(cid:3)

Now

(i) asρ2 = ϕ(aρ2) = ϕ(aρ · ρ) ∼ aρ2 gives a−1as ∈ Kρ2 ;
(ii) asρ4 = ϕ(aρ3 · ρ) ∼ auρ4 gives (a−1)sau ∈ Kρ2 ;
(iii) auρ3 = ϕ(aρ3) = ϕ(aρ · ρ2) ∼ aρ3 gives a−1au ∈ Kρ3 ;
(iv) auρ3 = ϕ(aρ2 · ρ) ∼ asρ3 give au(a−1)s ∈ Kρ3 .

Since Kρ2 , Kρ3 are subgroups (i) and (ii) give a−1au ∈ Kρ2 for all a ∈ A. Thus

by (iii) we have a−1au ∈ Kρ2 ∩ Kρ3, so that Lemma 6.14 tells us that u = 1.

Similarly, (iii) and (iv) give a−1as ∈ Kρ3 , which combined with (i) gives a−1as ∈
Kρ2 ∩ Kρ3 , from which we obtain s = 1, using Lemma 6.14. Thus we now have
ϕ = IdG. This gives:

Corollary 6.15. The group of type p6 has weak Cayley table group generated by
W0(G) and τρ2 , µρ3 , µx2, µy2.
(cid:3)

The groups cm, pm, pg

18

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

Here we have t ∈ F such that ϕ(aσ) = atσ.

If t = 1, then we are done.
So assume that t 6= 1, t ∈ F .
In each such group we have the automorphism
ψ : (x, y, r) 7→ (x−1, y−1, r−1), where r is σ, σ, γ respectively, for the three groups.
Then composing ψ with ι gives ϕ, and we have proved:

Corollary 6.16. The groups of type cm, pm, pg have trivial weak Cayley table
groups.
(cid:3)

§7 The groups of type p4mg

We note that much of what we have done in other cases does not apply to a

group of type p4mg.

Here we start by assuming ϕ|A = IdA and ϕ(At) = At for all t ∈ F . Let

U = hxy, x2i, X = hx2i, Y = hy2i, V = hxyi, W = hxy−1i.

In the next two results we list the conjugacy classes and involutions:

Lemma 7.1. Let a = xiyj ∈ A. Then
(xiyj)G = {x±iy±j, x±iy±j};

(aρ)G = U aρ ∪ U axρ3;
(aρ2)G = U aρ2;
(aρ3)G = U aρ3 ∪ U axρ;
(aγ)G = Y aγ ∪ Y a−1x−1yγ ∪ Xaρxρ2γ ∪ Xaρ3
(aργ)G = V aργ ∪ V a−1ργ ∪ W y−1aρρ3γ ∪ W x−1(a−1)ρρ3γ;
(aρ2γ)G = Xaρ2γ ∪ Xa−1xy−1ρ2γ ∪ Y aρ3
(aρ3γ)G = W aρ3γ ∪ W x−1y−1a−1ρ3γ ∪ V xaρ3

yγ ∪ Y aρx−1γ;

y−1ρ2γ;

ργ ∪ V x−1aρργ. (cid:3)

Lemma 7.2. Any involution in G is in one of the cosets:

(a) Aρ2;

(b) V ργ;

(c) x−1W ρ3γ. (cid:3)

Now assume that ϕ(ρ) = aρ, a ∈ A. Note that Ix(ρ) = (xy)−1ρ, Iy(ρ) = xy−1ρ,
so that by acting by some Ib, b ∈ A, we can assume ϕ(ρ) ∈ {ρ, xρ}. If we have
ϕ(ρ) = xρ, then composing with the automorphism ψ1 we see that ϕ(ρ) = ρ. Now
let ϕ(γ) = aγ. Lemma 5.2 gives a ∈ hyi. Note that (ργ)2 = 1 and Lemma 7.2
implies that ϕ(ργ) ∼ ργ. So Lemma 7.2 (b) with ϕ(ρ · γ) ∼ ρaγ tells us aρ3
∈ V ,
so a ∈ V ρ = W. We conclude that a ∈ hyi ∩ W is trivial. Thus we now have
ϕ(ρ) = ρ, ϕ(γ) = γ, so that ϕ(ρ3) = ρ3.

Now let ϕ(ρ2γ) = bρ2γ, b ∈ A. Lemma 5.2 gives b ∈ hxi. Then using Lemma
7.2 (b) again, (ργ)2 = 1 and ϕ(ργ) = ϕ(ρ−1 · ρ2γ) ∼ ρ−1bρ2γ = bρργ gives bρ ∈ V,
hence b ∈ W ∩ hxi. Thus b = 1 and ϕ(ρ2γ) = ρ2γ.

γ implies that cρ3

Assume that ϕ(ρ3γ) = cρ3γ, c ∈ A. By Lemma 5.2 we have c ∈ W. Note that γ =
ϕ(ρ·ρ3γ) ∼ ρcρ3γ = cρ3
∈ Y ∪Y x−1y, and so c ∈ X ∪Xxy−1. But
also, ρ2γ = ϕ(ρ3 ·ρ3γ) ∼ cρρ2γ implies that cρ ∈ X ∪Xxy−1, so that c ∈ Y ∪Y x−1y.
As c ∈ W ∩ (X ∪ Xxy−1) ∩ (Y ∪ Y x−1y) we see that c = 1, and so ϕ(ρ3γ) = ρ3γ.
The above shows that ϕ(v) = v for all v ∈ F \ {ρ2, ργ}. Thus by Proposition
6.2, for v ∈ F \ {ρ2, ργ} there is tv ∈ F \ {ρ2, ργ} such that for all a ∈ A we have

WEAK CAYLEY TABLE GROUPS OF SOME CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC GROUPS

19

ϕ(av) = atv v. Let t, u, w ∈ F satisfy ϕ(aρ) = atρ, ϕ(aγ) = auγ, and ϕ(aρ−1γ) =
awρ−1γ. By Lemma 6.5 we have u ∈ {1, γ} and w ∈ {1, ρ−1γ}.

Now let ϕ(ργ) = aργ, a ∈ A. Then Lemma 7.2 (b) gives a ∈ V , while ϕ(ρ · ργ) ∼
ρ2γ tells us a ∈ Y ∪ Y xy. Therefore we know a ∈ {1, xy}. However if we write

aρ−1
tργ = s, and assume ϕ(ργ) = xyργ, then

x2γ ∼ ϕ(x3 · x−1γ) = ϕ(x3ργρ) = ϕ(ργ · (x3)ργ ρ)

∼ xyργ(x3)ργtρ = xy(x3)sργρ = xy(x3)sγ−1 = y(x3)sγ.

This gives a contradiction unless s ∈ {ρ2, ρ2γ} which corresponds to t ∈ {ρ2, γ}. But
since (y−1)ρ2
= (y−1)γ = y and (x−1)γ = x−1 for any combination of t ∈ {ρ2, γ}
and u ∈ {1, γ} we have

ργ ∼ ϕ(ργ) = ϕ(y−1ρ · x−1γ) ∼ (y−1)tρ(x−1)uγ = yρ(x−1)γ = y2ργ,

which is a contradiction. Thus ϕ(ργ) = ργ.

Now we have ϕ(ρkγ) = ρkγ for k ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}, and we may apply Theorem 6.6
four times to get ϕ = Id on both reﬂection cosets and both glide reﬂection cosets.
Let ϕ(ρ2) = bρ2, b ∈ A. Since ϕ(ρ2 · γ) ∼ bρ2γ we see b ∈ X ∪ Xxy−1. By
considering ϕ(ρ2 · ρ2γ) ∼ bγ we know b ∈ Y ∪ Y x−1y. Thus b ∈ {1, x−1y−1}.
Assume b = x−1y−1. Since ρ2γ = x−1yγρ2 this gives

ρ2γ = ϕ(x−1yγ · ρ2) ∼ x−1yγx−1y−1ρ2 = x−2y2γρ = x−1yρ2γ

which is a contradiction according to Lemma 7.1. Thus ϕ(ρ2) = ρ2. We may now
apply Theorem 6.7 to obtain ϕ = IdG. Thus the groups of type p4mg have trivial
weak Cayley table group.
(cid:3)

Thus we have found generators for W(G) for each wallpaper group G. Presenta-
tions for W(G) can now be obtained; however in the trivial cases one can ﬁnd such
a presentation in [GW]. We thus only give presentations in the non-trivial cases:
Groups G of type p3 Here we have

W(G) = (hψx, ψyi ⋊ hτ, Iri) × hιi ∼= (Z2 ⋊ (C3 × C3)) × C2.

Note that Ix = ψ−1
are determined by:

x ψ−1

y , Iy = ψxψ−2

y . Here the actions for the semi-direct product

x = I −1
ψIr

y , ψIr

y = ψxψ−1

y , τ ψx = τ ψxψy, τ ψy = τ ψ−1

x ψ2
y.

Groups G of type p4 Let ψ1 : x 7→ x, y 7→ y−1, r 7→ r−1. Then we have

W(G) = (hτx, τy, τr2, σx, σy, σri ⋊ (hIx, Iyi ⋊ hIr, ψ1i)) × hιi

∼=(cid:0)(cid:2)(Z2 ⋊ C2) × (Z2 ⋊ C4)(cid:3) ⋊ (Z2 ⋊ D8)(cid:1) × C2

x τy, τ ψy
Here Z2 ⋊ C2 = hτx, τy, τr2i where τ ψx
direct product, and Z2 ⋊ C4 = hσx, σy, σri, where σσr
semi-direct product.

r2 = τr2τ −1

r2 = τr2τxτ −1
x = σ−1
y , σσr

y , gives this semi-
y = σx gives this

Next, the subgroup Z2 ⋊ D8 is Aut(G) = hψx, ψyi ⋊ hIρ, ψ1i. To see that Z2 ⋊ D8

acts on Z2 ⋊ C2 and Z2 ⋊ C4 we note that for µ ∈ Aut(G) we have

(τu)µ = τµ−1(u),

(σu)µ = σµ−1(u).

Thus for G of type p4 we can take N (G) = hτx, τy, τr2, σx, σy, σri in Theorem 1.1.

STEPHEN P. HUMPHRIES, REBECA A. PAULSEN

Groups G of type p6 Let α = xy, β = xy−2 and ψ : x 7→ y, y 7→ x, r 7→ r−1. Here
we have

W(G) = (hτx2 , τy2 , τr3, σα, σβ, σr2 i ⋊ (hIx, Iyi ⋊ hIr, ψi)) × hιi

with the details being similar to the last case.

∼=(cid:0)(cid:2)(Z2 ⋊ C2) × (Z2 ⋊ C3)(cid:3) ⋊ (Z2 ⋊ D12)(cid:1) × C2,

(cid:3)

Groups G of type p2mm We note that if G = H × J is a direct product of non-
abelin groups, then G always has a non-trivial weak Cayley table isomorphism: just
take ϕ × ψ, where ϕ ∈ Aut(H) and ψ ∈ W(J) is an anti-automorphism. A group
of type p2mm is a direct product. In this case we have

W(G) = ((hψ1,0, ψ0,1i ⋊ hτsσrs, i) ⋊ hIr, Is, ψi) × hιi

∼= ((Z ⋊ (C2 × C2)) ⋊ D8) × C2. (cid:3)

§8 The semi direct product cases: H = Zn ⋊ C2

So let H = A ⋊θ C2, where A = ha1, . . . , ani ∼= Zn and θ ∈ Aut(A). Let C2 = hri
and Z = Z(H). We write elements of H as arε, a ∈ A, ε ∈ {0, 1}. We also assume
that H is not abelian. This allows us to assume that ai /∈ Z(H) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n,
since if ai ∈ Z(H) and aj /∈ Z(H), then we just replace ai by aiaj. We further note
that a ∈ A is in Z(H) if and only if ar = a.

Let Ai = haii, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

Lemma 8.1. (i) For a ∈ A we have aH = {a, ar}.

(ii) For h = ar ∈ H \ A we have hH = H ′h.

Proof (i) is clear since A is abelian of index 2.

For (ii) we note that ra = a−1arr, so that for b ∈ A we have (br)am

= b(a−1ar)mr

for all m ∈ Z. Let

Let Bi = hβii ≤ H ′, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and note that

βi = a−1

i ar

i ∈ H ′,

1 ≤ i ≤ n.

(a−1

Also for a ∈ A we have (ar)Ai = aBir and so (ar)A = ahB1, . . . , Bnir.
Also

(ar)Ar = (hB1, . . . , Bniar)r = hB1, . . . , Bnirarr = hB1, . . . , Bniarr

= hB1, . . . , Bni(ara−1) · ar.

Here we note that ara−1 ∈ H ′ and the result will follow upon showing that

H ′ = hB1, . . . , Bni. Now for b ∈ A we have

(ai, br) = a−1

i rb−1aibr = a−1

i rair = a−1

i ar

i ∈ Bi,

and

Proof From Lemma 8.1 we see that (ar)H is inﬁnite for any a ∈ A. Thus only
the elements of A have ﬁnite conjugacy classes, and so ϕ(A) = A. Now from
aH = {a, ar} we have ϕ(a) ∼ ϕ(ar) = ϕ(a)r. Thus ϕ({a, ar}) = {ϕ(a), ϕ(a)r}.

Lemma 8.3. For all n ∈ Z and a ∈ A we have ϕ(an) = ϕ(a)n.

Proof We have aH = {a, ar}. Let ϕ(a) = α, so that ϕ(ar) = αr. We then have
ϕ(aε) = αε for ε = 0, ±1. So now assume (inductively) that ϕ(ai) = αi for |i| < n
for some n ≥ 2 and that ϕ(an) 6= αn. Then

ϕ(an) = ϕ(a · an−1) ∼ ααn−1 ∈ {αn, (αn)r},

which shows that ϕ(an) = (αn)r. In particular we have ϕ(an) = (αn)r 6= αn.

Now α = ϕ(a) = ϕ(an · a1−n) ∼ (αr)nα1−n. Thus we must have either

(a) (αr)nα1−n = α; or
(b) (αr)nα1−n = αr.

If we have (a), then (αr)n = αn, from which we get (since A is a free abelian

group) αr = α, giving a contradiction.

If we have (b), then we get (αr)n−1 = αn−1, which again gives αr = α, since
(cid:3)

n ≥ 2. This gives another contradiction and we have completed the proof.

For any a ∈ A we can write a = aλ1

Lemma 8.4. (1) For any b ∈ A such that br has order 2 the homomorphism
determined by a 7→ a, (a ∈ A), r 7→ br is an automorphism of H.

(2) Let ψ ∈ Aut(A) where ψ commutes with θ. Then the homomorphism deter-

mined by a 7→ ψ(a), (a ∈ A), r 7→ r is an automorphism of H.

Proof (1) is clear since r and br have order 2 and abr = ar.

(2) The relations in H have the form ar = aθ and r2 = 1. We have ψ(ar) =
(cid:3)

ψ(θ(a)) = θ(ψ(a)) = (ψ(a))r, and we are done.

Since ϕ(Ar) = Ar we can assume that ϕ(r) = br for some b ∈ A. Further, we

know that br has order 2, since ϕ is a weak Cayley table map.

By Lemma 8.4 we can assume (by composing ϕ with the inverse of such an

automorphism) that b = 1 i.e. that ϕ(r) = r.

Lemma 8.5. Suppose that a ∈ A. Then ϕ(ar) = ϕ(a)r.

Proof We know that ϕ(ar) ∈ {ϕ(a), ϕ(a)r}; however if ϕ(ar) = ϕ(a), then ar = a
(so that a = ar and ϕ(a) = ϕ(ar) are central), and otherwise we have ϕ(ar) =
ϕ(a)r.
(cid:3)

This lemma shows that the automorphism of A determined by the action of ϕ
commutes with the action of θ. Since ϕ|A is a automorphism of A we can now use
Lemma 8.4 (2) and Lemma 8.5 so as to be able to assume that ϕ|A = id|A.

Thus we can now assume: ϕ|A = Id|A and ϕ(r) = r.
By Lemma 6.1 we know that if a ∈ A and ϕ(ar) = br, b ∈ A, then b ∈ {a, ar}.

Thus if ϕ(ar) 6= ar, then ϕ(ar) = arr = ra.

Now assume that there are a, b ∈ A \ {1} such that ϕ(ar) = ar 6= arr, ϕ(br) =

brr 6= br. Then

bar = ϕ(bar) = ϕ(br · ar) ∼ ϕ(br)ϕ(ar) = brrar = brar.

It follows that either bar = brar or bar = ab, each possibility giving a contradic-

tion.

Thus there is ε ∈ {0, 1} such that ϕ(ar) = arε

the identity map on H.

So now assume that ε = 1, so that ϕ satisﬁes

r for all a ∈ A. If ε = 0, then ϕ is

ϕ(a) = a, ϕ(ar) = arr,

for all a ∈ A.

Then for all a, b ∈ A we have: rab = (ab)rr = ϕ(a · br) ∼ abrr = arb, so that either
(i) rab = arb; or (ii) rab = (arb)r. But (i) gives (a, r) = 1, and (ii) gives (b, r) = 1.
Since (i) and (ii) are true for all a, b ∈ A we have a contradiction, and we have
proved Theorem 1.2.
(cid:3)

Theorem 8.6. Let p be an odd prime, A an abelian group and let G = A ⋊θ Cp be
a semi direct product. We assume that θ is not trivial. Then G has a non-trivial
weak Cayley table map.

Proof This will also give a proof of Theorem 1.3. Let Cp = hri.

Lemma 8.7. (i) Let 1 ≤ k < p. Then every g ∈ G′ has the form (a, rk) for some
a ∈ A.

(ii) For any 1 ≤ k < p and g ∈ G′ there is a ∈ A such that (rk)a = grk.

WEAK CAYLEY TABLE GROUPS OF SOME CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC GROUPS

23

Proof The proof of (i) is standard, using the Witt-Hall identities [MKS, p. 290].

(ii) Now let g ∈ G′ and ﬁx 1 ≤ k < p. Then by (i) there is a ∈ A such that

g = (a, r−k) = a−1rkar−k, so that grk = (rk)a.

This concludes the proof of Lemma 8.7.

Now deﬁne a bijection ϕ : G → G by

(cid:3)

ϕ(a) = ar for a ∈ A, ϕ(g) = g for g ∈ G \ A.

Since θ is not trivial there is some a ∈ A such that ar 6= a. Thus ϕ(a)ϕ(r) =
ar · r 6= ar = ϕ(ar), so that ϕ is not a homomorphism. Similarly we have, using
the fact that p > 2,

so that ϕ is not an antihomomorphism.

ϕ(ar)ϕ(r) = arr 6= rar = ϕ(r · ar),

We now show that ϕ is a weak Cayley table isomorphism. We need to show that
ϕ(g1g2) ∼ ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2) for all g1, g2 ∈ G, and we do this by considering the following
situations:
CASE 1: g1, g2 ∈ A. Here we have ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2) = gr
CASE 2: g1 ∈ A, g2 /∈ A. Here we write g1 = a, g2 = brk, a, b ∈ k, 1 ≤ k < p.
Then

2 = (g1g2)r = ϕ(g1g2).

1gr

ϕ(g1g2) = ϕ(abrk) = abrk, ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2) = ϕ(a)ϕ(brk) = (arb) · rk.

Now by Lemma 8.7 there is c ∈ A such that

(arb)(ab)−1 = ara−1 = (c, r−k) = (rk)c · r−k.

Then we have

ϕ(g1g2)c = (abrk)c = (ab)(rk)c = (ab) · (arb)(ab)−1rk

= ar(brk) = ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2).

This does this case and a similar argument does the case where g1 /∈ A, g2 ∈ A.

CASE 3: g1 /∈ A, g2 /∈ A, g1g2 /∈ A. Here we have ϕ(g1) = g1, ϕ(g2) = g2, ϕ(g1g2) =
g1g2 and so ϕ(g1g2) = g1g2 = ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2), which does this case.
CASE 4: g1 /∈ A, g2 /∈ A, g1g2 ∈ A. Here we have ϕ(g1g2) = (g1g2)r and
ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2) = g1g2, from which it follows that ϕ(g1g2) = (ϕ(g1)ϕ(g2))r.

This concludes the proof that ϕ is a weak Cayley table isomorphism.
