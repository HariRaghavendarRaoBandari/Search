Abstract—The paper addresses distributed multi-target track-
ing in the framework of generalized Covariance Intersection
(GCI) over multistatic radar system. The proposed method is
based on the unlabeled version of generalized labeled multi-
Bernoulli (GLMB) family by discarding the labels, referred as
generalized multi-Bernoulli (GMB) family. However, it doesn’t
permit closed form solution for GCI fusion with GMB fam-
ily. To solve this challenging problem, ﬁrstly, we propose an
efﬁcient approximation to the GMB family which preserves
both the probability hypothesis density (PHD) and cardinality
distribution, named as second-order approximation of GMB (SO-
GMB) density. Then, we derive explicit expression for the GCI
fusion with SO-GMB density. Finally, we compare the ﬁrst-
order approximation of GMB (FO-GMB) density with SO-GMB
density in two scenarios and make a concrete analysis of the
advantages of the second-order approximation. Simulation results
are presented to verify the proposed approach.

I. INTRODUCTION

Due to their scalability, ﬂexibility, robustness and fault-
tolerance, distributed signal processing methods provide
unique advantages over similar but centralized techniques. A
particular family of such methods are the distributed sensor
fusion techniques used for multi-object estimation, or more
speciﬁcally, multi-target tracking (MTT). These techniques are
at the core of various distributed multi-sensor MTT systems
such as multistatic radar systems. Those systems have received
signiﬁcant attention in the last decade, and have been used
in a wide range of applications from trafﬁc monitoring to
battleﬁeld surveillance.

A distributed sensor fusion solution for multi-target tracking
usually includes two major components: (i) an efﬁcient and
robust multi-target ﬁlter to run locally in each node of the
sensor network, independent of the network structure, and
(ii) an algorithm for distributed fusion of the information
received by each node from multiple other nodes, that includes
unknown level of correlation.

In terms of choosing the multi-target ﬁlter component of an
optimal distributed multi-sensor multi-target tracking system,
we note the recent development of the notion of labeled
random ﬁnite sets and their associated ﬁlters [1]. Filters such
as Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (LMB) ﬁlter [2] and Vo-Vo ﬁlter
(also called Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB)
ﬁlter)1 have been of signiﬁcant interest due to their superior

time.

performance in terms of accuracy of cardinality and state
estimation as well as tracking multiple trajectories. Vo-Vo
ﬁlter [1], [4] provides a closed-form solution to the optimal
Bayesian ﬁlter, and has shown to outperform the well-known
Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) ﬁlter and its cardinal-
ized version, CPHD ﬁlter, and the multi-Berboulli (MB) ﬁlter
in challenging multi-target tracking scenarios.

This paper focuses on the sensor fusion component of the
distributed MTT solution, with particular interest in Vo-Vo ﬁl-
ter to be chosen as the local multi-target ﬁlter running in each
node of the sensor network. An effective information fusion
algorithm is expected to combine the information generated by
a number of sensor (e.g. radar) nodes and to achieve state esti-
mates and target tracks that are in maximum consistence with
all the information obtained from multi-sensor measurements.
Because of the unacceptable cost of computing the common
information between nodes, optimal fusion [5] is ruled out
and one needs to resort to robust suboptimal fusion rules.
Mahler [6] proposed the Generalized Covariance Intersection
(GCI) fusion rule based on Exponential Mixture Densities
(EMDs). Using this rule, both Gaussian and non-Gaussian
formed multi-target distributions from different radars with
completely unknown correlation, can be fused sub-optimally.
Following the introduction of GCI fusion rule by Mahler,
Clark et al. [7] developed tractable formulations for GCI-based
fusion of multi-target posteriors. This work was followed by
particle implementation [8] and Gaussian mixture implementa-
tion [9] of distributed fusion of Poisson posteriors (suitable for
solution designs involving PHD ﬁlters working in each node),
then a distributed track-before-detect (TBD) solution based on
using local Bernoulli ﬁltering of measurements provided by a
Doppler-shift sensor network [10]. Wang et al. [11] recently
presented a distributed fusion method with multi-Bernoulli
(MB) ﬁlters [12]–[18] working in each node, based on GCI
rule.

With the recent development of labeled set ﬁlters and their
advantageous performance compared to previous (unlabeled)
random set ﬁlters, the design of new distributed sensor fusion
systems (with labeled set ﬁlters working in each node) is
of both fundamental and practical interest. The major task
here is to develop tractable algorithms for sufﬁciently accurate
GCI-based fusion of labeled random set posteriors. This is
a challenging task because of the label space mismatching
phenomenon; the same realization can be drawn from label
spaces of different sensor nodes, which do not have the same

implication. To tackle this problem, based on the assumption
that all the sensor nodes share the same label space for the birth
process, Fantacci et al. [19] implementes the GCI fusion with
labeled set ﬁlters by using the consistent label directly. In [19],
analytic formulas for distributed fusion using labeled RFSs are
presented and the approach performers well in the situation
where the label spaces of each radar node are matching.

An alternative approach is to perform GCI-based fusion
with the unlabeled versions of the distributions in the GLMB
family, named as generalized multi-Bernoulli (GMB) family.
Wang et al. [20], [21] proposed a tractable solution to the
GCI fusion of GMB posteriors via approximating each with a
multi-Bernoulli (MB) distribution that matches its ﬁrst-order
moment (its PHD). The approximate MB distribution was also
referred to as the ﬁrst-order approximation of GMB (FO-
GMB) distribution.

In this paper, we focus on the second fusion approach
and address the problem of the distributed GCI-based fusion
with labeled set ﬁlters. Inspired by the approach through
which PHD ﬁlter was extended to CPHD, and LMB to Mδ-
GLMB, we present a second order approximation to a GMB
density (SO-GMB) that matches not only its PHD but also
its cardinality distribution. Just as the CPHD and Mδ-GLMB
ﬁlters perform better than PHD and LMB ﬁlters (because
both preserve the second-order characteristics), we expect that
distributed fusion of SO-GMBs performs better than FO-
GMBs. We formulate a tractable GCI-based fusion rule for
SO-GMB densities. The fused posterior turns out to be another
GMB distribution, and the formula enables sequential fusion
within a network of more than two radar nodes. We analyze the
performance of GCI-based fusion with SO-GMB densities in
different application scenarios. The simulation results indicate
that while the performance of SO-GMB fusion is slightly
better than FO-GMB fusion in simple tracking scenarios, in
challenging situations where the targets are crossing and move
in close proximity, SO-GMB fusion signiﬁcantly outperforms
FO-GMB fusion.

II. BACKGROUND

This section provides a brief review of GLMB RFS, GMB
RFS and GCI fusion necessary for the results of this paper.
For further details, we refer the reader to [20].

A. Notation

In this paper, we adhere to the convention that single-target
states are denoted by the small letters, e.g.,x, x while multi-
target states are denoted by capital letters, e.g.,X, X. Symbols
for labeled states and their distributions/statistics (single-target
or multi-target) are bolded to distinguish them from unlabeled
ones, e.g., x, X, π, etc. To be more speciﬁc, the labeled single
target state x is constructed by augmenting a state x ∈ X
with a label ℓ ∈ L. Observations generated by single-target
states are denoted by the small letter, e.g., z, and the multi-
target observations are denoted by the capital letter, e.g., Z.
Additionally, blackboard bold letters represent spaces, e.g., the
state space is represented by X, the label space by L, and the
observation space by Z. The collection of all ﬁnite sets of X

is denoted by F (X) and Fn(X) denotes all ﬁnite subsets with
n elements.

Moreover, in order to support arbitrary arguments like sets,
vectors and integers, the generalized Kronecker delta function
is given by

and the inclusion function is given by

δY (X) ,(cid:26) 1,

if X = Y
0, otherwise

1Y (X) ,(cid:26) 1,

if X ⊆ Y
0. otherwise

B. GLMB RFS

The GLMB multi-object distribution was recently formu-
lated and introduced by Vo and Vo [1]. Approximating the
prior by this general type of distribution for labeled multiple
objects forms the basis of an analytic solution to the Bayes
multi-object ﬁlter. Under the standard multi-object model, the
GLMB is closed under the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation
and is also a conjugate prior with the well-known point mea-
surement likelihood. Thus, with a GLMB prior, the predicted
and posterior densities are guaranteed to be GLMB as well.
Let L : X × L → L be the projection L((x, ℓ)) = ℓ, and
∆(X) = δ|X|(|L(X)|) denote the distinct label indicator. A
GLMB is a RFS on X × L distributed according to

π(X) = ∆(X)Xc∈C

w(c)(L(X))[p(c)]X

(3)

where C is a discrete index set. The weights w(c)(L) and the
spatial distributions p(c) satisfy the normalization conditions

(1)

(2)

(4)

(5)

w(c)(L) = 1

XL⊆LXc∈C
Z p(c)(x, ℓ)dx = 1.

The GLMB density (3) can be interpreted as a mixture of
multi-object exponentials.

C. GMB RFS

The unlabeled version of GLMB, called Generalized Multi-
Bernoulli (GMB) is a multi-object distribution deﬁned in the
state space X and given by [20]:

π({x1, . . . , xn}) =

Xσ X(I,φ)∈Fn(I)×Φ

w(I,φ)

n

Yi=1

(6)

p(φ),I v(i)(cid:0)xσ(i)(cid:1)

where the summation Pσ is taken over all permutations on

the number 1, · · · , n, Φ is a discrete space, I is the index set
of densities, I v ∈ I|I| is a vector constructed by sorting the
elements of set I, w(I,φ) and p(φ),ı(x) satisfy

X(I,φ)∈F (I)×Φ

w(I,φ) = 1

Z p(φ),ı(x)dx = 1, ı ∈ I.

(7)

(8)

The cardinality distribution of GMB RFS is given by

ρ(n) = X(I,φ)∈Fn(I)×Φ

Accordingly, the PHD becomes

w(I,φ).

D. GCI Fusion Rule

The GCI fusion rule was proposed by Mahler [6] specif-
ically to enable the fusion of FISST densities in distributed
multi-sensor fusion applications. In a network of sensors (e.g.
a radar network), consider the point measurement sets returned
by the sensors at two nodes, and denote them by Z k
1 and
time. Let us also denote the
Z k
i ), and
measurement history at node i by Z 1:k
the current multi-object state by X k = {xk

2 where k is the current

i = (Z 1

i , . . . , Z k

1, . . . , xk

n}.

At

time k, node 1 maintains computes its own local
multi-object posterior π1(X k|Z 1:k
1 ) through an update step,
and receives the locally updated posteriors from a number
of other (probably neighboring) nodes in the network. The
fusion problem is how to optimally combine the multiple
posteriors so that maximum information is preserved in the
fused posterior. We are specially interested in a fusion rule
that can be implemented in a sequential way. Thus, if one
of the nodes communicating its local posterior with node 1
is node 2, the fusion problem is reduced to the problem of
combining π1(X k|Z 1:k

1 ) and π2(X k|Z 1:k

According to the GCI fusion rule, a sub-optimal fused
distribution is given by the following geometric mean (or
exponential mixture) of the local posteriors,

2 ).

each node of the network. To fuse the posteriors coming
from neighboring sensor nodes, we assume that local GLMB
posteriors are turned into unlabeled GMB densities before
fusion. As it was mentioned earlier, Wang et al. [20] proposed
an approximate solution in which each GMB distribution
was replaced with an MB density with the same ﬁrst-order
statistical moment. The approximate MB density was called
a ﬁrst order approximation to the GMB density (FO-GMB
density) and a closed-form GCI rule-based fusion formula was
derived to combine two FO-GMB densities. The fused density
was shown to turn into a GMB itself.

In this paper, we follow the same approach explained
above, however, we introduce the novel idea that instead of
approximating a GMB with an MB density with matching
PHD, a better approximation can achieved when both the ﬁrst
moment and the entire cardinality distribution are matched. We
call such an approximate density as the second-order GMB
(SO-GMB) approximate.

Deﬁnition 1. Consider the GMB density π given in (6). A
SO-GMB density ˆπ corresponding to π is given by:

ˆπ({x1, . . . , xn}) =Xσ XI∈Fn(I)

where

ˆpı (x) =

w(I,φ)p(φ),ı(x)

(14)

(15)

Proposition 1. The SO-GMB density in (13)-(15) preserves
both PHD and cardinality distribution of the original GMB
density in (6).

It has been shown that among all exponential mixture densities
(EMDs), the density given by equation (11) minimizes the
following weighted sum of distances,

where D denotes Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) [9]. For
convenience, in what follows we omit the conditioning on the
observations and time index k.

III. GCI-BASED DISTRIBUTED FUSION

Consider a sensor network used in a multi-target track-
ing application, and a distributed sensor fusion and tracking
algorithm in which a Vo-Vo ﬁlter (with GLMB assumption
for underlying multi-target distributions) is run locally in

ˆpI v(i)(cid:0)xσ(i)(cid:1)) = Pφ′′∈Φ w(I,φ′′)p(φ′′),I v(i)(xσ(i))

and some algebraic manipulations (reordering the sums and
factoring out some terms), the PHD of the SO-GMB turns out
to simplify as follows:

(17)

which matches the PHD of original GMB density given by
equation (10).

¯w(I,τ )

Remark 1. PHD is usually perceived as the density of
targets, visualizing how their likely places are scattered in the
single-target state space. This makes the PHD an instrumental
characteristic of multi-target distributions, to the extent that
the closest Poisson density to any given density (in terms of
Kullback-Leibler distance) is the Poisson density that matches
the PHD of the original density. Furthermore, cardinality
distribution characterizes the entire probability distribution of
the number of targets, using which an EAP or MAP estimate
of cardinality can be directly computed [22]. Matching the
cardinality distributions of two multi-object densities means
that they share the same EAP and MAP cardinality estimates.
Hence, matching both the PHD and cardinality distributions of
two multi-object densities is expected to result in densities that
are sufﬁciently close to each other for estimation and tracking
purposes.

Remark 2. Note that the SO-GMB density (13) is also a
GMB RFS, especially in the form of the unlabeled version
of LMB RFS [20], and provides the prerequisite condition
for distributed fusion with GMB distribution. But the num-
ber of terms in SO-GMB distribution is substantially lower
than GMB distribution. Indeed, the number of components

puted is |F (I)| which is substantially smaller than the number

(cid:0) ˆw(I), ˆpı (x)(cid:1) in SO-GMB which need to be stored and com-
of components (cid:0)w(I,φ), p(φ),ı(x)(cid:1) in the original GMB given

by |F (I) × Φ| for w(I,φ) plus |Φ| for p(φ),ı(x).

Before the implementation of the GCI fusion, one need to
ﬁrstly compute the ˆw(I) and ˆpı (x) under each hypothesis I
according to (14) and (15), which is similar to the marginal-
ization with respect to the association histories performed in
Mδ-GLMB .

A. GCI Fusion Based on SO-GMB Density
Deﬁnition 2. A fusion map (for the current time) is a function
τ : I1 → I2 such that τ (i) = τ (i∗) implies i = i∗, the set of
all such fusion maps is called fusion map space denoted by
T . The subset of τ with domain I is denoted by T (I).

Remark 3. The fusion maps play the same role of the
measurement-track association map in the Vo-Vo ﬁlter [4], but
note that the fusion maps require one set of tracks in radar
node 2 has the same cardinal number in radar node 1.

butions in (13), can be approximated as a GMB distribution

Fig. 1. Distributed fusion with SO-GMB ﬁlter schematic.

Finally, by substituting (26) and (27) into (11), we obtain the
fused density as the form of (18).

Remark 4. The EMD of the two SO-GMB distributions turns
out to be another GMB distribution, which can allow the
subsequent fusion with another radar node. However, it can be
seen from (18) that after fusion, each hypothesis I ∈ Fn(I)
generates a set of |T (I)| fusion maps and then we perform
all permutations on the number of targets n, resulting in an
approximate computational complexity of O (|T (I)| × n!). In
order to reduce the cost of computation, one can perform
truncation of fused GMB density using the ranked assignment
strategy [4], [24].

The schematic diagram shown in Fig. 1 shows a graphical
representation of the overall distributed fusion process as
proposed in this paper. Assuming that at each node of the
sensor network, a Vo-Vo ﬁlter is locally run, at each time k,
a local GLMB posterior is computed in each node using the
measurement (e.g. the radar scan) acquired by the sensor in
that node. Each node also receives GLMB posteriors from the
other nodes which are connected to it in the network. The
proposed method is then applied locally in each node to fuse
the local and all received posteriors.

The ﬁrst step of the distributed fusion procedure involves
turning all the GLMB posteriors to their equivalent GMBs by
marginalizing the labels. Each GMB density is then replaced
with its second-order approximation (SO-GMB) which pre-
serves both the PHD and cardinality distribution. The local
and incoming posteriors are then sequentially fused using to
the GCI-rule formulated for two GMB densities (see Propo-
sition 2). The resulting GMB is expected to sub-optimally
encapsulate all the complementary information provided by
the neibouring sensors. Thus, a highly accurate multi-object
state estimate (MAP or EAP) can be obtained from the
cardinality probability mass function and the location PDFs.
As implied by Fig. 1, in our experiments we computed MAP
estimates.

produce trajectories. Once we choose a local radar node and
use its label space as pre-image in the fusion map, the fused
SO-GMB distribution can inherit and reserve its labels.

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In two challenging scenarios, we examined the performance
of the proposed GCI-based fusion using SO-GMB distribu-
tions, and compared the tracking outcomes (in terms of the
resulting OSPA errors [25]) with the recent GCI-based fusion
rule using FO-GMB approximations. With both methods, the
local ﬁlters are Vo-Vo ﬁlters and the fusion weight of each
node ω1, ω2 in (11) are both chosen as 0.5. All performance
metrics are averaged over 100 Monte Carlo runs.

In both scenarios, the single target state includes planar

position and velocity,

xk = [px,k py,k

˙px,k

˙py,k]⊤

and each non-clutter point measurement is a noisy version of
the planar position of a single-target,

zk = [zx,k zy,k]⊤.

Thus, the single-target measurement model is given by

gk(zk|xk) = N (zk; Hkxk, Rk)

where In and 0n denote the n × n identity and zero matrices,
respectively, and ∆ = 1 s is the sampling period.

are ﬁxed parameters. In our simulations the chosen values are
σv = 5 m/s2 and σε = 14 m. The survival probability is
PS,k = 0.98; target detection in each sensor is independent
of the others, and probability of detection at all sensors is
PD = 0.9. The number of clutter reports in each scan is
Poisson distributed with λc = 15. Each clutter report is
sampled uniformly over the whole surveillance region.

A. Scenario 1

A set of targets move in the two dimensional region
[0, 10000 m]×[0, 10000 m], all traveling in straight paths with
different but constant velocities. The number of targets is time
varying due to births and deaths. Trajectories of two targets
intersect at location (4000 m, 2200 m) and time k = 5 s, three
targets meet at location (6000 m, 4900 m) and time k = 20 s.
The region and tracks are shown in Fig. 2.

The birth model

is a LMB RFS with four compo-
nents, all sharing the same probability of existence of
r(i)
B = 0.06, but having four different Gaussian densities.
The Gaussians have the same covariance matrix of PB =
diag(1002, 1002, 202, 202) but different means,

Comparative results in terms of cardinality statistics and
OSPA error (with parameters c = 200 m, p = 2) are shown
in Figs. 3 and 4. In each plot, the results returned by each
of the two local Vo-Vo ﬁlters are presented along with those
resulted from GCI-fusion of FO-GMB densities and from our
proposed GCI-based fusion of SO-GMB densities.

From Fig. 3, we observe that

the
ﬁlters (both local and fusion-based ones) perform similarly
in terms of cardinality estimation errors. Figure 4 shows that
the advantage of sensor fusion is more evident in OSPA errors

which are substantially smaller with GCI-based fusion meth-
ods. However, in this scenario, no substantial improvement
seems to be obtained with GCI-based fusion of SO-GMB
densities (proposed in this paper) compared to fusion of FO-
GMBs. Indeed, a closer look at Fig. 4 would reveal that OSPA
errors returned by fusion of SO-GMBs are visibly lower than
the ones returned by FO-GMBs at the times of death or when
the targets intersect (are located in close proximity of each
other).

B. Scenario 2

In order to signify the advantages gained by SO-GMB
fusion, triggered by the observation exclaimed in the previous
paragraph, scenario 2 was designed to include tracks that are
in close proximity most of the times, and include deaths and
births, as shown in Fig. 5.

The true and estimated cardinalities by the FO-GMB fusion
method, along with the standard deviation of the estimates over
100 Monte Carlo runs, are together presented in Fig. 6. Similar
plots for SO-GMB fusion cardinality estimates are shown
in Fig. 7. Comparing the standard deviations of cardinality

estimates in the two ﬁgures would lead to observation that
our proposed distributed sensor fusion method outperforms the
recent FO-GMB fusion method in terms of having a smaller
standard deviation.

Figure 8 shows the average OSPA errors returned by the two
fusion methods in this challenging scenario. Again, substantial
reduction in estimation error is observed with SO-GMB fusion
compared to FO-GMB fusion. Overall, the fusion method
proposed in this paper appears to perform with better stability
and more accurately and is more suited to tackle the problems
introduced by the cardinality changes.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we address the problem of distributed multi-
target tracking with labeled set ﬁlters in the framework of GCI
with consideration of label space mismatching phenomenon.
Based on the notation of GMB family, ﬁrstly, we propose
an efﬁcient approximation to the GMB family which pre-
serves both the PHD and cardinality distribution, referred to
as second-order approximation of GMB (SO-GMB) density.
Then, we derive the explicit formula for GCI-based fusion of
SO-GMB densities and devise a sequential fusion method for

distributed target tracking in sensor networks such as bistatic
radar networks. Finally, we compare the recently developed
method of GCI-based fusion of ﬁrst-order approximation
GMB (FO-GMB) densities with our proposed method in two
scenarios. The results show that while both methods perform
similar in simple tracking situations with no frequent targets
deaths and intersections between target trajectories, the SO-
GMB fusion method is advantageous in more challenging ap-
plications where targets move in close proximity with frequent
deaths.
