Pulsars orbiting around the black hole at our galactic center provide us a unique

testing site for gravity. In this work, we propose an approach to probe the gravity

around the black hole introducing two phenomenological parameters which char-

acterize deviation from the vacuum Einstein theory. The two phenomenological

parameters are associated with the energy momentum tensor in the framework of

the Einstein theory. Therefore, our approach can be regarded as the complement to

the parametrized post-Newtonian framework in which phenomenological parameters

are introduced for deviation of gravitational theories from general relativity. In our

formulation, we take the possibility of a relativistic and exotic matter component

into account. Since the pulsar can be regarded as a test particle, as the ﬁrst step,

we consider geodesic motions in the system composed of a central black hole and

a perfect ﬂuid whose distribution is static and spherically symmetric. It is found

that the mass density of the ﬂuid and a parameter of the equation of state can be

determined with precision with 0.1% if the density on the pulsar orbit is larger than

10−9 g/cm3.

I.

INTRODUCTION

After the invention of general relativity, through 100 years, a lot of veriﬁcation tests have
been done and it passed all of them starting from weak ﬁeld solar system tests until the
recent great discovery of gravitational waves from a binary black hole system[1]. Then, we
have entered into the next 100 years for the challenge to the discovery of an edge of general
relativity.

Binary pulsar systems, such as the Hulse-Taylor binary[2], have been used to test the
gravitational theories in the strong gravitational region compared to the solar system obser-
vations. Black hole (BH)-pulsar systems can be also powerful tools for testing the theories,
and the pulsar can be used as a unique probe for the environment around a BH. While
they have not been found yet, there are indirect evidences of the existence of BH-pulsar
systems in our galaxy[3]. One promising system is a pulsar orbiting around Sgr A∗ BH. Re-
cent simulations indicate that 200 pulsars exist within 4000 au from Sgr A∗ and the closest
one probably has semi-major axis 120 au[4]. In this paper, taking a pulsar orbiting around
Sgr A∗ BH into consideration, we propose an approach to test gravity around a BH with
two phenomenological parameters which characterize deviation from the vacuum Einstein
gravity.

Since the post-Newtonian(PN) approximation is still valid for pulsar motion with the
semi-major axis 120 au, we rely on the PN formalism throughout this paper. The
parametrized post-Newtonian(PPN) formalism is an extension of the PN formalism, and
the most popular phenomenological approach for test of gravitational theories. This formal-
ism contains ten free parameters, PPN parameters, which appear as coeﬃcients of potentials
in the metric and represent deviation from general relativity(GR). Observational constraints
on these parameters are summarized in Ref. [5]. If the deviation from GR is found in the
PPN framework, it may support modiﬁed gravity theories. However, in the PPN framework,
since matter eﬀects are not usually taken into account, one may suspect a possible matter
eﬀect. Then, the story of the Vulcan might be repeated not for the solar system but for
our galactic center. Possibility of unknown matter eﬀects might not be excluded using the
PPN framework alone. Therefore, as a complement to the PPN framework, we introduce
phenomenological parameters to see how it deviates from the vacuum.

In a phenomenological point of view, we do not necessarily persist in ordinary healthy
matters. As for the dark energy problem in cosmology, an energy component with an exotic
equation of state could play crucial role to explain actual phenomenon even if its origin
is not revealed.
In the case of the dark energy problem, there are a lot of attempts to
explain the accelerated expansion of our universe by using modiﬁed gravity theories instead
of introducing an extra-ordinary matter component.
In other words, the evidence of the
exotic equation of state might imply modiﬁcation of the gravitational theory rather than
the existence of matter ﬁelds. Therefore, it is interesting to consider a relativistic exotic
matter component around a BH with GR to be valid. For this purpose, diﬀerently from
the conventional PN formalism, we keep our formalism general enough so that relativistic
matter components can be treated. In analogy with the dark energy problem, we introduce

3

an extra-ordinary matter ﬁeld with the equation of state p = wε, where p and ε are the
pressure and energy density, respectively and w is a constant.
It should be noted that,
although we introduce the extra-ordinary matter component in analogy with the dark energy,
it is not necessarily identical to the dark energy which causes the accelerated expansion of
our universe. ε and w should be regarded as purely phenomenological parameters which
characterize deviation of the geometry from the Kerr BH.

For Sgr A∗ BH, a pulsar around it can be treated as a test particle. Therefore we focus on
geodesic motion in this spacetime described by the PN approximation. In the conventional
PN scheme, mass density of ﬂuid contributes from Newtonian order while the pressure does
only PN orders. However, as is mentioned above, we also consider relativistic ﬂuid, in which
the mass density and the pressure may contribute to the geometry at the same order. We
introduce the ﬂuid component as a small perturbation from the vacuum Einstein theory.
Thus, the mass density and the pressure of the ﬂuid are assumed to equally make only
post-Newtonian contributions. This prescription enable us to describe the geodesic motion
around a BH with surrounding relativistic ﬂuid.

This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we derive the PN metric in the situation of
our interest. In Sec. III we focus on the geodesic equation and show the diﬀerence from it
without a ﬂuid component. We give an estimate of the eﬀect of the surrounding ﬂuid to the
pericenter shift in Sec. IV. Sec. V is devoted to a summary and discussion.

In this paper, the speed of light and the Newton’s gravitational constant are denoted by

c and G, respectively.

II. METRIC

In this section, we derive the metric of spherically symmetric system composed of a BH

and a surrounding matter component. The Einstein equations are given by

Rµν −

1
2

gµνR =

8πG
c4 T µν,

(1)

where Rµν and R are the Ricci tensor and scalar, respectively, gµν is the spacetime metric
and T µν is the energy-momentum tensor. We consider a central BH and static spherically
symmetric perfect ﬂuid distribution having the energy-momentum tensor

T µν = (ρ +

p
c2 )uµuν + pgµν,

(2)

where ρ and p are the mass density and the pressure, respectively, and uµ is the four velocity
of the ﬂuid element. Hereafter, we use a Cartesian coordinate system given by (t, x) or (t, xj),
and r := |x|. In this notation, the four velocity can be described by uµ = γ(c, 0), where γ
is determined by the normalization condition: gµνuµuν = −c2.
Since we perform PN expansion, in our approximation, the matter density can be de-
scribed as follows:

ρ =

ρ∗
•(r)

γ√−g

+

ε
c2

(3)

4

with ρ∗
•(r) := M•δ(r), where M• is the mass of BH and g is the determinant of the metric
gµν, and ε is the surrounding ﬂuid energy density. The equation of state of the surrounding
ﬂuid is assumed to be p = wε, where w is a constant.
It should be noted that, in a
phenomenological point of view, global distribution of the ﬂuid is not necessarily needed but
local distribution near the pulsar trajectory may be enough. Therefore, in this paper, we
regard the equation of state as an approximate one valid only near the pulsar trajectory.
Then, we do not take the global distribution into account.

Let us introduce expansion parameters. In the situation of our interest, a PN expansion

parameter ǫ can be deﬁned by

ǫ :=

GM•
c2R

,

(4)

where R is the reference radius given by a characteristic distance scale of the test particle
orbit. We introduce another expansion parameter deﬁned by

α :=

MR
M•

:=

4π
3

(εR/c2)R3

M•

,

(5)

where εR is the energy density of the matter at the radius R from the BH. We consider
that the surrounding ﬂuid is sparse enough for α to be regarded as a small quantity. Since
we have two expansion parameters, for convenience, we introduce the following notation
O(ǫn, αm) which denotes higher order terms of O(ǫn) or O(αm). We consider the geodesic
equation up to the order of αǫ compared to the Newtonian order. The order α2 term does not
appear in the geodesic equation. Although the order ǫ2 terms give usual 2PN contributions,
for simplicity, we neglect them by assuming ǫ < α in this paper. In summary, we neglect
O(ǫ2, α2) terms in the geodesic equation.
Following the method given in Ref. [6], neglecting the terms proportional to G3 in g00 and
G2 in gjk, we obtain the following expressions for a spherically symmetric static near-zone
metric in the standard harmonic gauge:

case of the Hadamard regularization. This prescription yields same outer metric as that of
treating the BH as a ﬁnite size object.

For later convenience, we consider the following coordinate transformation:

¯xj = xj(cid:0)1 −

where A is a constant, which will be determined later. The metric after the transformation

(14)

Finally we determine the distribution of the perfect ﬂuid by solving the Euler equation.

In our case, it leads to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation:

ε(r) = εR(cid:26)1 +

1 + w

r − 1(cid:17)ǫ + O(ǫ2)(cid:27) .

(15)

(16)

We ﬁnd that this solution is nonzero at spatial inﬁnity unless εR = 0. The near zone metric
cannot be deﬁned for the ﬂuid not having a compact support. However, as is mentioned
before, we consider the equation of state p = wε is approximately valid only in the vicinity of
the test particle orbit, we do not care about the distribution beyond the region of our interest.

6

Furthermore, due to the spherical symmetry, the motion of test particle is independent of
the distribution outside the orbit. We see this fact in the next section. For the same reason,
we do not care about the singular behaviour of ε for r → 0 in this paper. In this viewpoint,
the parameters εR and w should be regarded as just phenomenological parameters which
characterize the deviation of the local geometry from the vacuum GR case. It is worthy to
note that, even if we consider these parameters are not really matter eﬀects but eﬀective
description of some modiﬁed gravity theory, since the eﬀective energy momentum tensor
must be equal to the Einstein tensor, it must be compatible with the Bianchi identity.
Therefore, the hydrostatic equilibrium condition must be, at least locally, imposed in any
case.

before.

The ﬁrst term of the equation is the Newtonian term, the second one is 1PN term and others
are the terms describing the contribution from the ﬂuid. The values of expansion parameters
are estimated as

where ρR = εR/c2 is the mass density of the ﬂuid. α and w are the phenomenological
parameters, which describe the deviation from the vacuum GR.

Let us consider how the orbital radius and phase deviate from the vacuum GR case.
In our setting, the orbital motion is restricted within a ﬁxed orbital plane as well as the
Keplerian case. The 1PN term and the terms proportional to α in the geodesic equation
cause deviation from the Keplerian motion. The orbital radius of the full system ¯rﬂuid is

8

FIG. 1: The vertical axis is the logarithm of |¯rﬂuid − ¯r0|,|φﬂuid − φ0| and ¯r is the dimensionless
quantities, which are normalized by the reference radius R. The horizontal axis is the time t which is

presented in units of tr = pR3/GM . The value of parameters of red line correspond to

ρR = 10−9 g/cm3, w = −2/3 and that of blue one correspond to ρR = 10−12 g/cm3, w = −2/3.

diﬀerent from that without ﬂuid ¯r0 and the orbital phase φ := arctan(y/x) also diﬀers from
each other. The deviation from the vacuum case is explicitly shown in Fig. 1 for two speciﬁc
parameter sets. In Fig. 1, the unit time tr is given by

tr = 0.1 yr(cid:18) M•

106M⊙(cid:19)−1/2(cid:18) R

100 au(cid:19)3/2

.

(25)

The initial condition is set so that the orbit is the circle with the radius R in the Newtonian
order. While the diﬀerence of orbital radius is periodic, that of the orbital phase increases
monotonically.

IV. PERICENTER SHIFT

When we evaluate values of model parameters in a theoretical model by using obser-
vational signals from a pulsar, the parametrized post-Keplerian (PPK) formalism[8–11] is
used. In the PPK formalism, deviation from the Kepler motion is characterized by the PPK
parameters. Therefore, we extract the values of PPK parameters from observational signals
ﬁrst. Then, comparing those observational values with theoretical values, we can determine
the model parameters.
In our case, ρR, w are the model parameters characterizing the
system.

We roughly estimate the range of ρR in which the model parameters can be determined
from the future SKA observation[12]. For this purpose, we focus on precession of pericenter,
which is contained in the PPK parameters. In our setting, if we take an average for one
period, change of other Keplerian parameters vanish. We use the osculating method(see
Appendix A) to calculate the pericenter shift due to the surrounding ﬂuid. Setting R = a,
where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit, the pericenter shift due to the existence of the

ﬂuid can be calculated as

∆ωα = −3πα√1 − e2(1 + 3w),
∆ωαǫ = 5παǫ√1 − e2(cid:16)1 +
w(cid:17),

11
5

9

(26)

(27)

where e is the eccentricity of the orbit, and the detailed calculation is given in Appendix A.
Therefore, we obtain

∆ωα ∼ −6 × 10−5 (1 + 3w)(cid:18)1 − e2
w(cid:17)(cid:18)1 − e2
∆ωαǫ ∼ 1 × 10−5(cid:16)1 +

In order to evaluate detectable values of ∆ωα and ∆ωαǫ, we compare these values with
the eﬀect of BH spin. For the BH having a spin vector S, the spin parameter χ is deﬁned
by χ := c|S|/GM 2. The spin vector is assumed to be parallel to the angular momentum
of the test particle. Then, we can calculate the acceleration due to the spin eﬀect(see, e.g.
Ref. [7]) in the same way adopted in Sec. III as follows:

d¯v
d¯t

= 2ǫ3/2χ

(¯v · λ)n − (¯v · n)λ

(30)

where λ is the unit vector with λ ⊥ n, S.

The pericenter shift due to the spin eﬀect ∆ωspin is derived in the osculating method:

∆ωspin = −

.

(31)

The spin parameter of Sgr A∗ could be measured with precision of ∼ 0.1% after ﬁve years
of observations with SKA[12]. Comparing ∆ωα and ∆ωspin, we can conclude that if ρR ∼
10−12 g/cm3, the value of ρR(1+3w) can be measured with precision of ∼ 0.1% but the value
of ρR and w cannot be measured independently. For much denser ﬂuid, ρR ∼ 10−9 g/cm3,
we can expect to measure the value of ρR and w with precision of ∼ 0.1%. We need to
perform detailed simulation as is done in Ref. [12] to accurately estimate detectability of ρR
and w.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS

In this work, we have proposed another approach to test the gravity around a BH with a
surrounding matter component. We have treated the BH as a point-like mass and consider
relativistic perfect ﬂuid, whose pressure can make the same order contribution to the ge-
ometry as that from the mass density. For simplicity, we have assumed a static spherically

10

symmetric system. Adopting the PN approximation, we have derived the geodesic equation
up to the desired order. We have estimated the pericenter shift due to the eﬀects of the
ﬂuid and shown that the mass density and the parameter of the equation of state w can
be determined with the precision of ∼ 0.1% if the mass density around the pulsar orbit is
∼ 10−9 g/cm3.

Our analysis may be aﬀected by environmental eﬀects around BH[13]. Signiﬁcance of
the eﬀects due to baryonic gas and stars around BH is summarized in Ref. [14]. Especially
the perturbation due to stellar distribution is discussed in Ref. [15]. The results in Ref. [15]
show that the pericenter shift due to the stellar distribution is given by ∆ωα with w = 0.
Thus, the eﬀect of star distribution can be taken into account within our formulation. The
dynamical friction from the interstellar gas for pulsar motion is discussed in Ref. [16]. The
dynamical friction from the relativistic ﬂuid yields an extra advance of pericenter and it is
order of (Mp/M•)α, where Mp is the mass of the pulsar and Mp/M• ∼ 10−6. For an orbit
with ǫ ∼ 10−4, the dynamical friction contribution is two orders of magnitude smaller than
the contribution of the order of αǫ.

If we observe deviation from the vacuum GR, there are two possibilities to explain the
deviation; one is the existence of unknown mater components and the other is an alternative
theory to GR. In our formulation, the observed value of w < 0 indicates that some exotic
matter exists around the BH with GR to be valid. In other words, we are confronted with
a choice of accepting the exotic matter or modifying gravity theory from GR.

It would be interesting to consider extension of our formulation to, for example, stationary
systems, BH-pulsar systems and non-spherically symmetric systems. They are left as future
work.

Appendix A: Pericenter Shift with the Osculating Method

In this Appendix, we calculate the pericenter shift based on the usual perturbation scheme
known as the method of osculating orbital elements[17, 18]. Here we consider the terms
proportional to α in the geodesic equation (20) as perturbing forces. Let us start with a
general form of the geodesic equation:

dv
dt

GM
r2

= −

n + f ,

(A1)

where M is the mass of the central object and f is a perturbing force per unit mass. We
take the orbital plane to coincide with x-y plane and the direction of the angular momentum
is z-direction. We introduce base vectors n := x/|x| and λ such that λ ⊥ n, ez and |λ| = 1.

Then, the velocity v and the angular momentum h can be expressed as follows:

v = (v · n)n + (v · λ)λ,
h : = x × v := hez,

where h = |h|. The perturbing force can be decomposed as

f = An + Bλ,

11

(A2)

(A3)

where we have assumed that the force along ez is zero for simplicity.

Through a conventional method(see, e.g. Ref. [7]), we can derive the following expression
for the derivative of the longitude of pericenter ω with respect to the true anomaly ν(the
angle between the pericenter and the position vector x):

This function for n = 2 and 3 is given by

Therefore, ﬁnally we obtain

∆ωα = −2πα√1 − e2(1 + 3w),
∆ωαǫ = 5παǫ√1 − e2(cid:16)1 +
