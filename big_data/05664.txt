FULL-DEPTH COADDS OF THE WISE AND FIRST-YEAR NEOWISE-REACTIVATION IMAGES

Aaron M. Meisner1,2, Dustin Lang3,4, and David J. Schlegel2

Draft version March 21, 2016

ABSTRACT

The Near Earth Object Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) Reactivation mission
released data from its ﬁrst full year of observations in 2015. This data set includes ∼2.5 million expo-
sures in each of W1 and W2, eﬀectively doubling the amount of WISE imaging available at 3.4µm and
4.6µm relative to the AllWISE release. We have created the ﬁrst ever full-sky set of coadds combining
all publicly available W1 and W2 exposures from both the AllWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation
(NEOWISER) mission phases. We employ an adaptation of the unWISE image coaddition framework
(Lang 2014), which preserves the native WISE angular resolution and is optimized for forced pho-
tometry. By incorporating two additional scans of the entire sky, we not only improve the W1/W2
depths, but also largely eliminate time-dependent artifacts such as oﬀ-axis scattered moonlight. We
anticipate that our new coadds will have a broad range of applications, including target selection
for upcoming spectroscopic cosmology surveys, identiﬁcation of distant/massive galaxy clusters, and
discovery of high-redshift quasars. In particular, our full-depth AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds will
be an important input for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) selection of luminous
red galaxy and quasar targets. Our full-depth W1/W2 coadds are already in use within the DECam
Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) reduction pipelines. Much more
work still remains in order to fully leverage NEOWISER imaging for astrophysical applications beyond
the solar system.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE;
Wright et al. 2010) has performed a full-sky imaging sur-
vey in four broad mid-infrared bandpasses centered at
3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns, labeled W1-W4 from blue
to red. WISE has dramatically enhanced our knowledge
of the mid-infrared sky, and publicly released numerous
catalog and imaging data products of high value to the
astronomical community.

WISE launched in December 2009, and undertook a
seven month, full-sky survey in all of W1-W4 from Febru-
ary 2010 through August 2010.
In September 2010,
the solid hydrogen cryogen used to cool the W3 and
W4 instrumentation was depleted, signiﬁcantly reducing
the quality of W3 imaging and rendering W4 unusable.
Nevertheless, WISE continued surveying the sky from
September 2010 to February 2011 in W1 and W2, includ-
ing a portion of the mission referred to as NEOWISE
(Mainzer et al. 2011).
In February 2011 WISE was
placed in hibernation. In October 2013, WISE was reac-
tivated, and recommenced surveying the sky in W1 and
W2. This W1/W2 survey is referred to as NEOWISE-
Reactivation (NEOWISER) and is expected to continue
until 2017. The ﬁrst-year NEOWISER data products, in-
cluding all single-exposure images, were publicly released
in March 2015. Importantly, the NEOWISER images are
of very nearly the same high quality as those of the pre-

hibernation WISE mission (Mainzer et al. 2014).

Several data products consisting of full-sky, stacked
WISE imaging are currently available for the ﬁrst 13
months of data. The WISE team has created a set of
“Atlas” coadds smoothed by the point spread function
(PSF) using the ﬁrst 7 months of data (the All-Sky re-
lease), and the ﬁrst 13 months of data (the AllWISE re-
lease). In an independent processing eﬀort, Lang (2014)
has produced custom “unWISE” stacks analogous to the
AllWISE Atlas images, but at the full spatial resolution
of the instrument. These unWISE stacks are optimized
for forced photometry, and have proven to be an impor-
tant input for eBOSS target selection (Lang et al. 2014;
Myers et al. 2015; Prakash et al. 2015).

However, until now, no full-sky set of W1/W2 coadds
combining all pre and post reactivation exposures has
existed. The primary motivation for such a data prod-
uct is the enhanced depth achieved relative to AllWISE-
only coadds. Among other beneﬁts, this added depth
will improve the utility of WISE for selecting higher-
redshift spectroscopic targets, in particular for the up-
coming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI,
Levi et al. 2013). Furthermore, folding in two additional
scans of WISE data at each sky location allows time-
dependent artifacts to be nulled, largely eliminating spa-
tial nonuniformities in image quality and derivative cat-
alogs.

Here we present a new set of full-sky coadds gener-
ated by combining all publicly available W1/W2 expo-
sures from the AllWISE and NEOWISER programs, us-
ing an adaptation of the Lang (2014) unWISE method-
ology. These ‘full-depth’ coadds are publicly available
online.5

In §2 we brieﬂy describe the W1/W2 single-exposure
data set from which our coadds are constructed. In §3,
we review the important aspects of the unWISE coad-
dition framework we employ and list the processing fea-
tures which are newly introduced in this work. In §4 we
describe an empirical photometric calibration we derived
in order to combine pre and post reactivation WISE im-
ages. In §5 we describe our rejection of time-dependent
artifacts, particularly scattered moonlight. In §6 we de-
scribe our procedure for recovering Moon-contaminated
exposures.
In §7 we highlight some important aspects
of the full-sky set of full-depth coadds generated by our
processing. In §8 we present a catalog-level validation of
the improvements in WISE depth that result from dou-
bling the amount of W1/W2 imaging. We conclude in §9
with a brief discussion of the work which still remains to
be done with existing and future NEOWISER imaging.

2. DATA

The WISE single-exposure “L1b” images represent the
input data for our W1/W2 coadds. Speciﬁcally, for each
L1b frameset, we make use of the per-band -int-, -msk-
and -unc- images, which respectively give the measured
sky intensity and associated per-pixel bitmask values and
uncertainty estimates. We have obtained a local copy of
these ﬁles for every publicly available frameset, including
those from the AllWISE release (∼2.8M framesets) and
ﬁrst-year NEOWISER release (∼2.5M framesets). In all
we have analyzed ∼5.3M framesets in each of W1 and
W2, corresponding to a total of ∼32M L1b image ﬁles,
∼71TB of input image data and ∼33×1012 pixels.

In addition to L1b images, we also make use of sev-
eral catalog-level WISE data products. During the pho-
tometric calibration described in §4, we select sources
to photometer based on the AllWISE Source Catalog
(Cutri et al. 2013). Also, to ﬂag and reject bright solar
system planets (§5), we employ the WISE Known Solar
System Object Possible Association List for each mission
phase (Cutri et al. 2012, 2013, 2015).

IMAGE COADDITION METHODOLOGY

To stack the W1/W2 single exposures, we make use
of the Lang (2014) unWISE coaddition framework, and
perform our image processing with an adaptation of the
codebase from that work. We brieﬂy mention a few of the
salient aspects of the unWISE coaddition methodology
here; for a full discussion see Lang (2014).

Like the oﬃcial WISE Atlas coadds, unWISE process-
ing divides the sky into a set of 18,240 1.56◦×1.56◦ tiles
arranged along iso-declination rings. Whereas the At-
las images are smoothed by the WISE PSF, the un-
WISE code uses Lanczos interpolation to preserve the
native WISE angular resolution during coaddition, cre-
ating stacked outputs which are 2048 pixels on a side,
with 2.75′′ pixels.

During the course of this work, various modiﬁcations
have been made to the unWISE codebase and methodol-
ogy. Here we highlight the important updates/changes:

• We include all publicly available NEOWISER W1
and W2 exposures, approximately doubling the
number of input L1b frames relative to the Lang
(2014) processing.

• We adopt custom zero points based on repeat pho-
tometry at the ecliptic poles. In contrast, the Lang
(2014) unWISE processing adopted zero points ex-
tracted from the L1b header metadata.

• We explicitly reject exposures contaminated by the
Moon and/or solar system planets. No such re-
jection was included in the Lang (2014) unWISE
W1/W2 coadds, although these and other artifacts
were addressed to some extent via general-purpose
outlier rejection.

• In this work we attempt to recover Moon-aﬀected
frames by applying polynomial background level
corrections to the contaminated exposures.

The outputs generated in this work follow the same
data model as those of Lang (2014). For each tile, a
stacked intensity image is created, as well as auxiliary
maps of useful quantities such as the per-pixel inverse
variance and integer coverage. Like those of Lang (2014),
our coadds have units of Vega nanomaggies.

4. CUSTOM PHOTOMETRIC CALIBRATION

In order to combine frames across multiple mission
phases, it is necessary to place all exposures on a com-
mon photometric calibration so that the multiplicative
scalings of all input images are consistent. Each L1b
image includes a MAGZP header keyword which gives the
nominal Vega zero point of that exposure. These zero
points are essentially predictions of system throughput
based on predictors such as beam splitter assembly tem-
perature, and have been found to diﬀer by up to several
percent relative to zero point variations measured em-
pirically with single-exposure photometry of calibrator
sources (e.g. Cutri et al. 2013, §V.3.a.iii.1).

We therefore sought to derive an empirical relative
photometric calibration across all mission phases accu-
rate at the sub-percent level. To do so, we analyzed
repeat measurements of compact sources near the eclip-
tic poles, where WISE has gathered data every ∼95 min-
utes throughout the entire mission. Speciﬁcally, our sam-
ple consists of moderately bright, unsaturated compact
sources with |β| > 85◦, avoiding a wedge deﬁned by
−90◦<λ< 25◦ near the south ecliptic pole to exclude
the LMC. The positions and average magnitudes of our
moderately bright source sample were drawn from the
AllWISE Source Catalog, selecting W1 sources with 10.6
< w1mpro < 13.1 and W2 sources with 9.2 < w2mpro <
11.7, always requiring w?cc_map=0 in the band of inter-
est.

These spatial, magnitude and ﬂag cuts yield samples
of ∼109,000 (∼27,000) unique calibrator sources in W1
(W2). We perform aperture photometry using djs_phot
with a 27.5′′ radius for each calibrator source in every L1b
exposure in which it appears suﬃciently far from the im-
age boundary. This results in a catalog of ∼45M (∼15M)
W1 (W2) single-epoch aperture ﬂuxes (in units of DN),
which will form the basis for our derived time-dependent
zero points. The typical calibrator source contributes
&400 epochs of photometry.

We desired a photometic calibration with time res-
olution of one day. To achieve this, we grouped our
single-exposure aperture photometry measurements in
two ways. First, for each unique source, we lumped all

Fig. 1.— Summary of our custom photometric calibration. In each panel, the red dashes give the per-day photometric zero points we
derived based on repeat measurements of stars near the ecliptic poles, as described in §4. The gray lines show the MAGZP zero point values
provided by the L1b header metadata. The magenta (green) dashes represent the zero point time trends which would have resulted had

of its All-Sky phase measurements together to obtain its
median ﬂux (DN) in our aperture photometry system
during this phase. This is justiﬁed because the All-Sky
release photometric zero points are known to be remark-
ably stable (Jarrett et al. 2011). Indeed, using our eclip-
tic pole single-exposure photometry database, we were
able to conﬁrm that the All-Sky phase zero point was
stable at the ≤2 mmag level in both bands. Next, for ev-
ery aperture ﬂux after the All-Sky phase, we calculated
a multiplicative enhancement factor implied by the ratio
of that measurement to the appropriate source’s median
All-Sky phase ﬂux. We then grouped these ﬂux enhance-
ment factors into one-day bins, and quote the median per
bin as the change in multiplicative image scaling relative
to the All-Sky zero point. For the All-Sky phase zero
points, we adopted the MAGZP values of 20.752 in W1
and 19.596 in W2.

Figure 1 shows our derived zero points for each WISE
mission phase as compared to the MAGZP values obtained
from the L1b headers. In general, our per-day zero points
agree reasonably well with the MAGZP values, although
there are often percent-level diﬀerences, and at times
disagreement at the several percent level. In some cases
the empirically measured time trends within a partic-
ular mission phase show qualitative disagreement with
the header metadata (e.g. both the W1 and W2 zero
points during the NEOWISE mission phase). When scal-
ing each L1b image according to its zero point during
coaddition, we employ an interpolation scheme meant to
avoid directly using our somewhat noisy per-day mea-
surements. Speciﬁcally, we create a smooth approximate
representation of the measured per-day zero point time-

series, based on a series of polynomials and error func-
tions, tapering between segments such that the resulting
curve is smooth.

5. REMOVING TIME-DEPENDENT ARTIFACTS

The WISE scan strategy is such that a typical sky lo-
cation will be observed at approximately six month in-
tervals, with each six-monthly “visit” yielding a series of
∼12 exposures over a ∼1 day time span. Within the All-
WISE release, most of the sky contains just two visits of
W1/W2 imaging. Incorporating exposures from both the
AllWISE and NEOWISER phases eﬀectively doubles this
value to four visits everywhere on the sky. If we coadded
the AllWISE+NEOWISER data naively, without con-
cern for time dependent artifacts, we would risk corrupt-
ing regions of the sky that were pristine during the All-
WISE phase.
Instead, we have found that by leverag-
ing the added redundancy of extra NEOWISER visits
while carefully addressing time-dependent artifacts, we
can create full-depth coadds which are nearly artifact-
free over the entire sky.

The dominant time-dependent artifact in W1/W2 im-
ages is oﬀ-axis scattered light from the Moon, which can
signiﬁcantly contaminate images at angular separations
of up to many tens of degrees. This contamination man-
ifests itself in L1b exposures as a strongly spatially vari-
able background level, which in certain images can be
smooth, but in others can show a very complex mor-
phology.

In the Lang (2014) unWISE processing, no steps were
taken speciﬁcally to mitigate scattered moonlight in W1
and W2. However, that analysis did address Moon con-

Meisner et al.

Fig. 2.— Tile 3433p000, a 1.56◦×1.56◦ region of sky at low ecliptic latitude which experienced strong Moon contamination during the
AllWISE mission phase. Rejecting Moon-contaminated frames as described in §5 while including two extra visits worth of NEOWISER
data has dramatically improved the background level uniformity relative to the Lang (2014) version of this tile. For this tile, we were able
to recover 58% (18%) of Moon-contaminated frames in W1 (W2).

tamination in W3 and W4. Lang (2014) inspected all
W3/W4 exposures ﬂagged with the MOON_MASKED bit,
and discarded those frames with abnormally large pixel
value standard deviations, indicative of a strongly vary-
ing background level (see Lang 2014 §2 for full details).
In the present work we have applied this same Moon
rejection criterion to W1 and W2 frames. Because of
the added redundancy of two extra NEOWISER scans,
we are thus able to reject many W1/W2 frames which
are contaminated by moonlight, while still retaining suf-
ﬁcient artifact-free coverage everywhere on the sky to
avoid leaving any holes in the stacks.

Figure 2 shows the dramatic improvement achieved to-
ward maintaining a consistent coadd background level
by virtue of folding in NEOWISER data and applying
the frame-level Moon rejection cut, for a tile with severe
Moon contamination during the AllWISE phase.

A second, less common type of time-dependent artifact
results when bright solar system planets (Mars, Jupiter
and Saturn) pass through the WISE ﬁeld of view. These
planet sightings are prominent in the Lang (2014) un-
WISE stacks, as no steps were taken to address such
occurrences. In constructing our new full-depth coadds,
we have used the Known Solar System Possible Associa-

AllWISE+NEOWISER Coadds

5

tion List to identify all exposures in which Mars, Jupiter
or Saturn fall within the WISE ﬁeld of view. We discard
such frames completely during coaddition and make no
attempt to recover them.

Bright planets are also accompanied by scattered light
halos a few degrees in size. Therefore, we additionally
use ephemerides to identify all frames within 2.5◦ of these
planets. During coaddition, such frames are initially ig-
nored. However, we later attempt to recover such frames
according to the procedure described below in §6.

6. RECOVERING CONTAMINATED FRAMES

Although we are able to dramatically reduce the im-
pact of Moon contamination on our coadds with the ex-
posure rejection procedure of §5, we would ideally like
to recover as much Moon-contaminated data as possible,
rather than simply discard it all outright. To that end,
we have added an after-burner step to our coaddition
procedure, during which we attempt to salvage frames
that were ﬂagged with MOON_MASKED and displayed ab-
normally large pixel value standard deviations. The pro-
cedure we employ is a variant of that described in §6.4.1
of Meisner & Finkbeiner (2014).

The ﬁrst two rounds of unWISE coaddition still pro-
ceed exactly as described in Lang (2014). These steps
yield a Moon-free stack which we subsequenty use as a
reference image to compare against, and derive low-order
corrections for, each Moon-contaminated frame.

For each frame initially rejected on the basis of Moon
contamination, we ﬁrst resample the exposure onto the
coadd astrometry. We then divide the exposure into
quadrants which we analyze separately. For each quad-
rant, we will attempt to model the Moon contamination
with a polynomial oﬀset as a function of L1b x, y pixel
coordinates. We begin by masking out the brightest and
faintest 5% of pixels in the reference coadd, since pixels
with bright compact sources will not be very informative
for background level modeling. We then ﬁt the diﬀerence
between the masked L1b quadrant and masked reference
coadd with a fourth order polynomial in L1b x, y coordi-
nates. We evaluate the chi-squared of this model, using
the reference coadd’s per-pixel standard deviation values
to construct per-pixel uncertainty estimates.

For each quadrant, we deem the polynomial correction
to be a satisfactory description of the scattered moon-
light if the mean per-pixel chi-squared is less than 2.5.
In that case, we then subtract the polynomial correction
from the quadrant, and consider the quadrant “recov-
ered”. Quadrants with poor chi-squared are discarded
and remain excluded from the coadd. Once a list of all
recovered quadrants has been assembled, these are accu-
mulated into the existing reference coadd to produce a
ﬁnal set of outputs for the tile under consideration.

Figure 3 provides an illustration of our polynomial
background modeling procedure applied to a single L1b
quadrant. We were able to recover 54% of Moon-
contaminated data in W1 and 33% in W2. We also apply
this polynomial correction procedure to frames that we
ﬂagged as potentially aﬀected by scattered light halos
from bright solar system planets. We categorically ex-
clude qual_frame=0 exposures, making no attempt to
recover such frames.

Figures 4 and 5 show large-scale renderings of our full-
depth coadds over portions of south Galactic cap. It is
apparent that the Moon contamination has been com-
pletely eliminated in W1 and dramatically reduced in
W2. It is possible that simply folding in additional NE-
OWISER W2 frames from forthcoming data releases will
diminish the remaining Moon imprint to such an extent
that no additional processing modiﬁcations will be re-
quired to address this issue.

Figure 6 shows zoom-ins of a low ecliptic latitude ﬁeld,
illustrating visually the reduction in statistical noise
which has been achieved by doubling the number of input
exposures.

Given that we imposed various frame-level cuts to elim-
inate time-dependent artifacts, it is reasonable to ask
whether we have created any zero-coverage holes as a re-
sult. We have checked all 18,240 of our integer coverage
maps, and ﬁnd that every pixel has ≥18 epochs in W1
and ≥15 epochs in W2.

8. CATALOG-LEVEL VALIDATION

It is important to quantify the eﬀect of increased cov-
erage on the W1/W2 depths achieved by catalogs based
on our AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds relative to those
based on the AllWISE-only coadds of Lang (2014). A
complete characterization should systematically explore
a range of ecliptic and Galactic latitudes, to consider the
full spectrum of interplay between decreased statistical
noise and confusion. For isolated sources in the sky noise
limit, we would expect a doubling of the W1/W2 imaging
data to increase the depth in each band by 0.38 mag.

The only existing catalogs based on our All-
WISE+NEOWISER coadds are those from DR2 of the
DECam Legacy Survey6 (DECaLS, Schlegel et al. 2015),
which include W1-W4 forced photometry for all optically
detected sources. On the other hand, optical sources in
DECaLS DR1 are accompanied by forced photometry of
the Lang (2014) unWISE coadds. Therefore, comparing
the uncertainties on W1/W2 ﬂuxes in DR2 versus DR1
can allow us to obtain estimates of the forced-photometry
depth increases for regions of low ecliptic and high Galac-
tic latitude.

To make such a comparison, for each of W1 and W2,
we select a sample of isolated DECaLS DR2 sources
with type=‘PSF’, wise_fracflux<0.1, more than one
DECam observation, and WISE S/N within the range
10±1. We then obtain a DR1-DR2 comparison sample by
cross-matching these DR2 objects with DR1 type=‘PSF’
sources, using a 1′′ matching radius. The resulting com-
parison samples have ∼415,000 objects. For such sources,
we ﬁnd median reductions in forced photometry ﬂux un-
certainties of 1.38× (1.30×) in W1 (W2). The corre-
sponding median increase in coverage is 1.9× in both
bands, leading us to expect a factor of 1.38× decrease
in ﬂux uncertainties based purely on reduced statistical
noise.

These values are not intended to represent the en-
hanced depths that would result from comparing WISE-
only catalogs which begin with a source detection step on
the WISE coadds. Since the DR2 forced photometry does
not attempt to account for faint, infrared-only sources
which are newly revealed in the AllWISE+NEOWISER

Fig. 3.— Illustration of the procedure by which we recover Moon-contaminated exposures, as described in §6. Shown here is quadrant
2 of W1 exposure 05245b140. This quadrant was successfully recovered. The polynomial background correction is subtracted from every
pixel in the L1b quadrant, but is shown masked for the sake of comparison to the masked L1b quadrant.

stacks, the photometric uncertainty reduction factors we
have derived serve mostly as quantitative conﬁrmation
of the decreased statistical noise shown in Figure 6.

Much more work is needed to characterize the in-
creased sensitivity of WISE to faint infrared-only sources
due to the inclusion of NEOWISER imaging, as this will
inform forecasts about the ﬁnal 3.4µm and 4.6µm depths
expected upon WISE’s permanent retirement.

9. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK

We have created a full-sky set of W1/W2 coadds
which combine all publicly available exposures from both
the AllWISE and NEOWISER releases. Doubling the
amount of WISE imaging relative to the AllWISE re-
lease has resulted in improved W1/W2 depths and al-
lowed for the elimination of nearly all time-dependent ar-
tifacts. Our new AllWISE+NEOWISER W1/W2 coadds
are publicly available via http://unwise.me.

Although the present analysis constituted a signiﬁcant
data processing endeavor, it represents only a small frac-
tion of the work that must be done to maximize science
return from the NEOWISER imaging data set. Creation
of time-resolved coadds spanning the ∼5 year AllWISE-
NEOWISER time baseline would enable a wealth of im-
portant time-domain projects, ranging from brown dwarf
searches to infrared quasar variability studies. As addi-
tional years of NEOWISER data become publicly avail-
able, it will be necessary to continue updating the full-
depth AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds to maximize the
achieved W1/W2 depths. Finally, the creation of WISE-
only (as opposed to forced photometry) catalogs based
on deep coadds which incorporate NEOWISER images
will be needed to enable a variety of exciting discoveries.

Fig. 4.— A large portion of the south Galactic cap near the ecliptic plane is shown in W2. Top: Lang (2014) unWISE coadds
based on the AllWISE release imaging and without rejection of Moon-contaminated frames. Bottom: same region of sky in our new
AllWISE+NEOWISER stacks, with double the redundancy in sky coverage and rejection/recovery of Moon-contaminated frames. It is
clear that the scattered moonlight, which appears as a series of vertical streaks, has been largely removed in W2, although some traces
still remain. The two dotted red boxes show locations where Jupiter passed through the WISE ﬁeld of view. The imprints of such planet
sightings have now been removed.
