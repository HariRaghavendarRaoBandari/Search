Switchable Topological Interface State in Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 Heterojunctions

(Dated: March 7, 2016)

Strain can induce a topological phase transition in bismuth dichalcogenides. We present the phase
diagram for 3D topological insulators Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 with uniaxial and biaxal
strain, which show metallic and insulating phases, both topologically trivial and non–trivial.
In
particular, uniaxial tension can drive Sb2Te3 into a topologically trivial insulating phase. Thus,
we propose a Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 heterojunction in which a topological interface state arises in the
common gap of this topological insulator–normal insulator heterojunction that can be switched on
or oﬀ by means of uniaxial strain. This interface state is conﬁned in the Sb2Te3 subsystem and is
physically protected from ambient impurities. Therefore, Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 heterojunctions can host
robust helical interface states with promising spintronic applications.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

II. METHODS AND CRYSTAL STRUCTURE

Topological insulators (TIs) are a novel quantum phase
invariant1–3
of matter characterized by a topological
that exhibit topologically protected states at the bound-
ary with a trivial insulator4.
In particular, the three–
dimensional (3D) TIs Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 have
been extensively studied during the last few years as
paradigmatic TIs that show an inverted band gap due
due to a strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC)5. At the
surface, these materials exhibit a Dirac cone–like heli-
cal state with a circular skyrmionic spin texture6, and
the topological protection ensures the robustness of these
states as long as time–reversal symmetry is maintained
and the gap is preserved.

In this article we study the role of combined uniaxial
and biaxial tension on the Bi2Se3 family of compounds,
namely Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3. Several
works have already assessed the importance of purely
uniaxial strain in these materials and its inﬂuence on
the topological character of these materials7–13, but, to
our knowledge, no study has systematically addressed
the combined eﬀect of both uniaxial and biaxial strain
in the topology of these systems. Being the four com-
pounds narrow gap semiconductors, small strain ﬁelds
can strongly aﬀect their electronic properties, and, conse-
quently, their topological nature. We calculate the phase
diagram for the four materials in terms of uniaxial and
biaxial strain, and we show the band inversion process
that governs their topology. The article is structured as
follows: in Section II we describe the methods employed
for the calculations along with the crystal structure of the
Bi2Se3 family of compounds. Section III is devoted to the
eﬀect of uniaxial and biaxial strain in bulk and thin ﬁlms
of the studied compounds. Next, we propose two topo-
logically distinct heterojunctions of Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3
and address their electronic properties in Section IV. Fi-
nally, Section V includes a summary of the results and
conclusions.

The bismuth dichalcogenides studied in this work show
a rhombohedral crystal structure with a ﬁve atom basis
that constitute a quintuple layer (QL) –see Figure 1–.
The four studied systems belong to the R3m (D5
3d) crys-
tallographic group. Along the [111] direction each atomic
layer is formed of only one element and is hexagonally
compact. The stacking pattern along this direction is
...AbCaB... where capital (small) letters indicate the po-
sition of Se or Te (Bi or Sb) atoms. Within a QL, in-
teractions among the atoms are strong, while inter–QL
bonding is of the weaker van der Waals (vdW) kind.

To model the systems we employed the Vienna ab-
initio simulation package (VASP)14 DFT code for the
atomic relaxations and electronic structure calculations
of bulk materials. The SIESTA code15, through its im-
plementation in the GREEN package16, was additionally
used for electronic structure calculations of the Bi2Te3–
Sb2Te3 heterojunctions. In all the calculations we used
the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof17 implementation of the
generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The semi–
empirical pair–potential vdW correction of Grimme18
was used in the atomic relaxations as implemented in the
VASP code to correctly account for the weak inter-QL
interaction. The spin–orbit coupling was included self–
consistently in both VASP19 and SIESTA–GREEN20 cal-
culations. A 340 eV energy cut–oﬀ was employed for
the plane wave basis set in VASP calculations, while a
double ζ-polarized scheme with conﬁnement energies of
100 meV was used for the numerical atomic orbital basis
set in SIESTA. Three–center integrals in SIESTA were
computed using an hyperﬁne mesh cut–oﬀ of 1200 Ry,
equivalent to a real space grid resolution below 0.05 ˚A3.
Biaxial (uniaxial) strain was taken into account by elon-
gating or contracting lattice parameter a (c) and allowing
the internal coordinates of the ions to relax. Biaxial and
uniaxial strain (a and c respectively) of a particular
compound with lattice parameters a, c are given by:

a = (a − aeq)/aeq
c = (c − ceq)/ceq

tion. Values in parentheses correspond to experimental data
from Ref. [24]. No experimental data was found for Sb2Se3 in
the rhombohedral phase.

In this way we can address the combined eﬀect of uniax-
ial (along the c direction) and biaxial strain. The results
are summarized in Figure 3 for the four compounds, and
their universal behavior is sketched in Figure 4. In the
former, for a ﬁxed value of a, points along vertical lines
correspond to increases of ∼ 1.5% of uniaxial strain, be-
ing the central point of each vertical line the relaxed value
of c for the given amount of biaxial strain in that line. For
the four systems, three distinct phases can be identiﬁed:
a metallic phase, a topologically trivial insulating phase
–normal insulator (NI), with Z2 topological invariant 0 –
and a topologically non–trivial phase –topological insula-
tor (TI), with Z2 topological invariant 1 –. The metallic

where aeq and ceq are the equilibrium values of the in–
plane and out–of–plane lattice parameters respectively.

III. UNIAXIAL AND BIAXIAL TENSION

A. Bulk

To address the eﬀects of biaxial tension, we ﬁrst cal-
culated the total energy of the Bi2Se3 family of com-
pounds for diﬀerent values of the lattice constants using
GGA+vdW with the VASP code. In this way, we obtain
the relaxed geometry for a ﬁxed value of the in–plane
lattice parameter a. Figure 2 shows the total energy of
Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 for diﬀerent values
of a as a function of the out–of–plane lattice constant c.
The equilibrium lattice parameters aeq and ceq were also
calculated, and are given in Table I. For compressive in–
plane biaxial strains (a < 0) lattice parameter c tends
to increase with respect to its equilibrium value. In fact,
we can estimate the value of the Poisson ratio ν from our
calculations with the following equation for equibiaxial
strained systems21:

c = − 2ν
1 − ν

a

(2)

Fitting the energy minima positions for the curves
shown in Figure 2 to eq. 2 we obtain Poisson ratios of
0.30, 0.32, 0.29 and 0.27 for Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and
Sb2Se3 respectively, in agreement with previous calcula-
tions12,22,23.

In order to address the combined eﬀects of out–of–
plane uniaxial and in–plane biaxial strain, the phase di-
agram of the Bi2Se3 family of compounds was computed
for several points in parameter space (a, c). For every pair
of values of the lattice constants, we allowed the ionic po-
sitions to relax and we calculated the energy spectrum.

FIG. 3. (a) Band gap (in color code shown on the right) for Bi2Te3 for diﬀerent values of lattice constants a and c. The
ionic conﬁgurations were allowed to relax for every single calculation. Negative gaps (purple) indicate that the energy of Bi pz
orbital is lower than the Se pz orbital, i.e., the system is topologically non–trivial. (b), (c) and (d) show equivalent diagrams
for Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 respectively. These phase diagrams show the regions in phase space where the system is a
normal insulator (orange), a TI (purple) or a metal (light gray). The equilibrium position is marked with a black square and
the thicker line corresponds to the relaxed c lattice parameter for a ﬁxed value of a for each system.

phase is obtained for large in–plane biaxial strains in any
direction. This is due to the fact that a high compressive
in–plane strain enhances the bandwidth of the px and
py orbitals in the valence band (VB), which eventually
crosses the Fermi level and makes the system metallic.
For high tensile in–plane biaxial strains, the conduction
band (CB) undergoes an analogous process, leading also
to a metallic system. For moderate in–plain strains (be-
low ∼ 10% in absolute value) the systems remain insu-
lating. In this range, the topological behavior of these
systems is governed by the band inversion between the
Se and Bi pz bands, and a topological phase transition
(TPT) can be induced by out–of–plane strain. Starting
from an inverted phase, for c < 0 the bandwidth of the
pz bands is enhanced, which in turn makes the gap bigger
at ﬁrst, until eventually the gap becomes indirect, starts
to decrease and at a certain large compressive out–of–
plane strain the system becomes metallic again. On the
other hand, tensile out–of–plane strain (c > 0) tends to
diminish the gap until it closes when the energies of the
Bi and Se pz bands at the Γ point become equal. Fur-
ther tensile strain reopens the gap, turning the system
into a topologically trivial insulator. Figure 5 shows the
behavior of the gap with out–of–plane strain for Bi2Se3

at a=4.20 ˚A. The band gap closing and reopening is evi-
dent, due to the crossing between the Bi and Se pz bands
that are responsible for the topological structure of the
Bi2Se3 family of compounds.

For a=0, the critical uniaxial strain for Sb2Se3, Bi2Se3
Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 is 3%, 6%, 6% and 12% respectively.
This trend is in turn related to the crystal structure and
the strength of the SOC in each system, being largest
in Bi2Te3, smallest in Sb2Se3 and intermediate in Bi2Se3
and Sb2Te3. Note that this values are given for zero bi-
axial in–plane strain, and the TPT will occur at diﬀerent
values of c for a (cid:54)= 0. Other studies have shown simi-
lar TPTs for Bi2Se3–like systems under purely uniaxial
strain of 6–10%7–13, which is in good agreement with our
results. Still, to our best knowledge no other previous
work has addressed the eﬀects on the topology of com-
bined uniaxial and biaxial strain systematically. More-
over, as the four systems show a positive Poisson ratio,
pure compressive biaxial strain induces an expansion in
the c direction which could, in principle, drive the sys-
tem into the normal insulating phase. Nevertheless, if
no additional uniaxial strain is applied, we ﬁnd that this
is not the case, since the four systems undergo a TI to
metallic phase transition with both tensile and compres-

sive biaxial strain. The phase diagram we provide can be
useful for topological, band and orbital engineering of the
Bi2Se3 family of compounds in the ﬁelds of straintronics
and spintronics.

Note on Sb2Se3

Our results predict unstrained Sb2Se3 to be a topolog-
ically non–trivial insulator. Previous calculations have
reported this material to be a normal insulator5,12,25 un-
der no strain. Comparing with Refs. 5 and 25, we ob-
tain smaller lattice constants (a=4.04 versus 4.076 ˚A,
c=28.7 versus 29.83 ˚A for Ref. 5, and similar values for
Ref. 25), probably due to the inclusion of vdW correc-
tions. With their lattice constants our calculations also
predict Sb2Se3 to be a narrow gap NI –see Figure 3 (d)–.
In Ref. 12 they obtain lattice parameters closer to ours
(a=4.026 ˚A, c=28.732 ˚A) within the GGA+vdW approx-
imation, but decide to set the equilibrium (unstrained)
conﬁguration at the plain GGA relaxed parameters
(without the vdW correction, a=4.078 ˚A, c=29.92 ˚A),
yielding again a NI phase. Recent calculations by other
group26 estimate smaller values of lattice parameters for
rhombohedral Sb2Se3 (a=4.004 ˚A, c=28.553 ˚A) and seem
to predict an inverted band structure for antimony se-
lenide –see the curvature of the bands around the Γ point
in Figure 2 (d) of Ref. 26–, but do not elaborate on its
topological nature. Unfortunately, experimental data for
Sb2Se3 is only available for its more stable orthorhombic
phase (Pnma)27.

B. Thin Films

Now we investigate the eﬀect of pure biaxial in–plane
strain along with low dimensional eﬀects on thin ﬁlms
of Bi2Se3–like systems. Our starting points are bulk cal-
culations in which, for a ﬁxed amount of biaxial strain,
the lattice parameter c was allowed to fully relax along
with the atomic coordinates, which corresponds to the

FIG. 5. PDOS in the Γ point for bulk Bi2Se3 with lattice
parameter a ﬁxed to 4.20 ˚A and diﬀerent values of c (left axis).
The equilibrium conﬁguration is marked with a thicker frame.
Black and red lines show the contribution of Bi pz and Se
pz orbitals respectively. The magenta and blue line indicate
the Bi and Se s contributions, while the gray and green lines
depict the Bi and Se px + py weight. At c ∼30 ˚A the bulk
band gap closes and the system undergoes a topological phase
transition, so that for c > (<) 30 ˚A the bands are uninverted
(inverted) and the system is topologically trivial (non–trivial).
The diﬀerent behavior of the Se and Bi pz bands with uniaxial
strain is apparent in the ﬁgure.

minimum of each curve for ﬁxed a in Figure 2, and to
the thick lines in Figure 3. Then, slabs of 1, 2, 3, 4 and
6 QL thicknesses were built with the bulk positions and
their band dispersions were computed. The results for
Bi2Se3 are shown in Figure 6 (see the results for Bi2Te3,
Sb2Te3 and Sb2Se3 in the appendix) for the range of
lattice parameter a in which the system is a TI. Com-
pressive biaxial strain drives Bi2Se3 into a metallic phase
due to the shift in energy of the valence band maximum
(VBM). On the other hand, at a critical tensile biax-
ial strain the bulk–like CB crosses the Fermi level and
the system becomes metallic again, so the behavior with
both compressive and tensile biaxial strain of thin ﬁlms
is in clear analogy with the bulk behavior. Nevertheless,
in the intermediate region the size of the bulk gap ac-
quires larger values than that of the unstrained system,
and therefore a smaller bulk contribution to the electron
mobility is expected. The penetration depth of the TSS
also varies with strain, and the closer in the phase di-
agram to the critical Metal–TI lines the more QLs are
needed to close the hybridization gap (see for instance
the 2 QL series in Figure 6, in which compressive or ten-
sile biaxial strain takes the system closer to a critical line

in the phase diagram, and the TSS are gapped but for
a = 4.20 ≈ aeq), in agreement with the results displayed
in Ref. [7]. The ”M”–shaped feature in the VB around
the ¯Γ point becomes more pronounced with tensile biax-
ial strain. Therefore, the Dirac point (DP) energy can
also be tuned, as a sharp enough ”M”–shaped feature
detaches the DP from the Fermi level (an example is the
6 QL series for Bi2Se3 in Figure 6). This induces n–type
doping in the surface states and explains the shift in the
DP observed in Ref. [13]. Moreover, a small decrease
in the Fermi velocity with tensile strain is also apparent
in the four systems. The table–like ﬁgures for the four
systems are displayed so that they can be used for deter-
mining what kind of band dispersion is expected when
a bismuth dichalcogenide of a certain thickness is grown
on a substrate with a particular lattice parameter. Strain
can therefore turn the Bi2Se3 family of compounds insu-
lating or metallic, and allows for engineering of the gap,
the orbital character of the bands, the Fermi velocity, DP
energy and thus also the doping of the TSSs.

IV. HETEROJUNCTIONS

When two distinct TIs are faced to one another, an
interesting problem arises.
If both materials belong to
the same Z2 topological class, no interface state is guar-
anteed by the bulk–to–boundary correspondence, as the
change in topological invariant is zero. Therefore, a sur-
face state can be annihilated by placing another (topo-
logical) insulator on top, even if both bulk gaps align in
a straddling gap conﬁguration. Still, topologically triv-
ial interface states may arise regardless of the topological
invariants, as the topological protection only holds for
surface or interface states within the bulk band gap re-
gion. In this section we will study interfaces of Bi2Te3
and Sb2Te3 both in superlattices and in slab geometry.
Among the four members of the Bi2Se3 family of com-
pounds, we have chosen these two so that the diﬀerence
in electronegativity, χ, between the A and B elements
in the A2B3 compounds is as small as possible, in or-
der to obtain a straddling gap at the heterojunction and
minimize the band bending along the system. Table II
shows the Pauling and Allen electronegativities (χP and
χA) for Bi, Sb, Te and Se. The ﬁrst two elements have
an almost equal value of the electronegativity –in fact
χP (Bi) < χP (Sb) while χA(Bi) > χA(Sb)–. On the
other hand, Se and Te show a bigger diﬀerence in their
χ values. Opposite doping for for Se- and Te-based ma-
terials is expected, and we have additionally calculated
Bi2Se3/Bi2Te3 heterojunctions which exhibit a broken
gap alignment, thus leading to a metallic phase where
the Z2 invariant is ill-deﬁned and no topological inter-
face states can exist.

electronegativities of Te and Se is signiﬁcant in both scales.

A. TI/TI interfaces

We have chosen Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 trilayers with
equal number of QLs of Sb2Te3 at both sides so that in-
version symmetry is preserved, making the analysis sim-
pler, as both interfaces will be equivalent. We calculated
m-Sb2Te3/n-Bi2Te3/m-Sb2Te3 trilayers, where m and n
are the number of QLs of Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 respectively.
In the superlattice geometry, due to periodic boundary
conditions, the trilayer turns into a 2m-Sb2Te3/n-Bi2Te3
structure repeated in the [111] direction. We still call it
a m-Sb2Te3/n-Bi2Te3/m-Sb2Te3 superlattice to empha-
size the centrosymmetric nature of the system. We ﬁxed
n=6, for which the surface–surface interaction in Bi2Te3
is negligible and a gapless Dirac cone (DC) develops at
the surface –see Fig. 8(f)–, while the number of Sb2Te3
QLs at both sides is varied from m=1 to 3. The AbCaB
stacking sequence of the pristine subsystems is preserved
along the interfaces and in the superlattices in order to
preserve inversion symmetry. The C3 rotation axis and
the three vertical mirror planes of the pristine systems
are also preserved in the heterojunction. We ﬁx the in–
plane lattice vector a to that of Sb2Te3 in equilibrium,
aeq=4.25 ˚A, and the c lattice parameter for each subsys-
tem is set to its relaxed value for a ﬁxed to the afore-
mentioned value, that is 30.9 ˚A for Sb2Te3 and 32.0 ˚A
for Bi2Te3 (see Fig. 2). The ionic coordinates within each
subsystem are ﬁxed to their relaxed bulk values, and the
vdW gap between Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 is taken as the av-
erage vdW gap between both subsystems. This setup
could correspond to a 6 QL thick Bi2Te3 slab grown on a
m–QL Sb2Te3 substrate, and another m–QL Sb2Te3 thin
ﬁlm grown on top of it. Figure 7 depicts the geometry
for the m=3 case. According to the phase diagram calcu-
lated in Fig. 3, both the Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 subsystems
show an inverted gap in the bulk. This means that the
existence of an interface state is not guaranteed, since
the change in the Z2 invariant across the interface is zero
as both materials are topological insulators..

We start by analyzing the electronic structure of the
isolated subsystems, depicted in Figure 8. Bi2Te3 under
small biaxial strain remains a TI, and so it develops sur-
face states when truncated in the [111] direction. For a
6 QL slab (as shown in the ﬁgure), surface–surface inter-
action is already negligible and the DCs are massless. In
contrast with Bi2Se3, the DP of the Bi2Te3 surfaces is
not at the Fermi level and lies below the VBM. This is in

FIG. 6. Band dispersion diagrams close to the ¯Γ point along the ¯M –¯Γ– ¯K directions for Bi2Se3 slabs under biaxial strain. Each
column corresponds to a ﬁxed value of the in–plane lattice parameter labeled on top. The ﬁve rows correspond to diﬀerent
slab thicknesses: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 QLs from top to bottom. The horizontal dashed lines indicate the Fermi level, whereas the
vertical dashed lines show the ¯Γ point.

Antimony telluride presents a topological surface state
being the DP at the Fermi level for 6 QLs. The penetra-
tion depth is ∼ 2 QLs, so that a gap opens in thin ﬁlms of
less than 5 QLs due to surface–surface hybridization. The
band structures of the periodic superlattices and the tri-
layer slabs are shown in Figure 9 for m=1, 2 and 3. The
former present a band gap of ∼ 0.1 eV, being the VB
(CB) oﬀset of ∼ 0.1 (0.05) eV between both subsystems,
with the VB (CB) of Sb2Te3 lying at a higher energy.
The small band staggering at the heterojunction can be
attributed to the small deviation in the values of the elec-
tronegativity for Bi and Sb. The bulk–to–boundary cor-
respondence predicts no topologically protected interface
state at the junction, and although trivial interface states
could develop, our results show that this is not the case.
We therefore conclude that this Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3 hetero-
junction is insulating with no interface states whatsoever,
but will develop surface states when truncated. This is
proved in the thin ﬁlm geometry, where surface states
than span the whole bulk band gap appear at both ends.
The DP of these TSSs is pinned at the Fermi level irre-
spective of the thickness of the Sb2Te3 layers. In fact,
even for the m=1 and 2 for which the thickness of the
Sb2Te3 subsystem is below the penetration depth of the
surface states, the spectrum still exhibits a semimetallic
character, which corroborates the fact that unstrained

layer with m=3 and n=6. The in–plane lattice parameter a is
ﬁxed to that of Sb2Te3 under no strain. Interfaces are shown
as dashed lines as a guide to the eye. The whole system follows
the AbCaB stacking pattern analogous to an fcc (111) crystal,
which ensures inversion symmetry is preserved. Superlattices
are constructed by imposing periodic boundary conditions on
this and similar trilayers, which will also preserve inversion
symmetry.

agreement with previous results5, and can be attributed
to the bigger curvature of the VB along the ¯Γ– ¯M direc-
tion. Sb2Te3 in this system presents neither uniaxial nor
biaxial strain, and it is therefore also in the topologically
non–trivial phase.
In Figure 8 the electronic structure
of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 QL thick Sb2Te3 ﬁlms is also shown.

Now we will discuss the eﬀect of applying uniaxial
tensile strain to Sb2Te3 in the system presented in the
previous subsection. The systems considered are again
m-Sb2Te3/n-Bi2Te3/m-Sb2Te3 trilayers in either a slab
geometry (thin ﬁlm) or a superlattice. The in–plane lat-
tice parameter is again ﬁxed to a=4.25 ˚A and c is set
to 32.0 ˚A for Bi2Te3, but now the Sb2Te3 subsystem is
expanded to c=34.0 ˚A, corresponding to a uniaxial strain
of -10%. According to the phase diagram shown in Fig-
ure 3, Sb2Te3 will now be in a normal insulating phase, so
that at the interface of Sb2Te3 and Bi2Te3 the topologi-
cal Z2 invariant will increase from 0 to 1. The TPT on
Sb2Te3 can be induced by external uniaxial tensile strain
as shown in the previous section, or, alternatively, by the
chemical intercalation of zerovalent non–magnetic met-
als in the vdW gaps of Sb2Te3, which eﬀectively induces
uniaxial strain along the [111] direction. This technique
has already been experimentally demonstrated and de-
veloped by Koski et al.30 in Bi2Se3, and we propose its
application to eﬀectively enhance the c lattice parame-
ter of Sb2Te3 without disrupting the ionic or electronic
conﬁguration.

The electronic structure of the diﬀerent isolated con-
stituents is shown in Figure 10. Sb2Te3 under such out–
of–plane strain shows no band inversion in the bulk, and
this is reﬂected in the thin ﬁlm electronic structure. In
contrast with the previously analyzed systems, Sb2Te3
now shows no surface state since it is in the NI phase.
The gap is of 0.4 eV for the 1 QL slab and decreases down
to 0.2 eV for the 6 QL thin ﬁlm. On the other hand,
the 6 QL Bi2Te3 slab under purely biaxial strain is a TI
which develops TSSs with no gap, and its DP lies below
the Fermi level. When the two subsystems are brought
together, the bulk–to–boundary correspondence dictates
that topologically protected interface states must develop
in the gap. The band structures of the junctions are
shown in Figure 11.

For periodic boundary conditions, and in contrast to
the trilayers analyzed in subsection IV A, a TIS develops
than spans the bulk band gap. This state is localized
in the normal insulator Sb2Te3, as opposed to TSSs of
unstrained Sb2Te3, which loalize in the topological insu-
lator. In this heterojunction a hybridization gap opens in
the spectrum for thicknesses of the 2m–Sb2Te3 layer be-
low m=2 QLs since the two opposed interfaces are closer
than twice the penetration depth of the TISs (see Fig-
ure 13). The TISs show no doping in contrast with the
TSS of 6 QL Bi2Te3 –see Figure 10 (f)–.

For the trilayer slab conﬁgurations shown in subﬁg-
ures (a) to (c), the system shows a common bulk gap of
∼ 0.15 eV and a gapless interface state with the DP at the
Fermi level. This interface state is also undoped and de-
velops irrespective of the thickness of the Sb2Te3 layers,
but is surprisingly not strictly localized at the interface.
Instead, the state at the gap is conﬁned in the Sb2Te3
subsystem, with more weight at the interfacemost QL of

involved in the TI/TI/TI trilayers. (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)
show the band dispersion for Sb2Te3 slabs of 1, 2, 3, 4 and
6 QLs respectively. (f) corresponds to a 6 QL Bi2Te3 thin ﬁlm
under biaxial compressive strain so that its in–plane lattice
parameter matches that of equilibrium Sb2Te3 (4.25 ˚A). All
subsystems are topologically non–trivial insulators, although
for thicknesses below ∼ 5 QL a gap opens in the TSSs due to
surface–surface interaction.

FIG. 9. Band structure of the m-Sb2Te3/n-Bi2Te3/m-Sb2Te3
trilayers considered. (a), (b) and (c) show the band disper-
sion for the trilayers in a superlattice with n=6 and m = 1, 2,
and 3 respectively. As all the constituents of the superlattice
are topologically non–trivial, there are no interfaces between
subsystems with diﬀerent value of the Z2 topological invari-
ant, and no interface state exists. (d), (e) and (f) correspond
to slab geometries with n=6 and m = 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
In these three cases a surface state develops irrespective of the
number of Sb2Te3 layers, but no interface state is present.

Sb2Te3 is a TI even for ultrathin ﬁlms, and supports the
idea that the Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 interface does not conﬁne
the topological state. The TSS localization is shown in
Figure 12 (a), for the three diﬀerent slabs. The surface
state is strongly conﬁned in the Sb2Te3 subsystem, with
a penetration depth of ∼ 2 QLs, although for the m=1
case the state strongly localizes at the surfacemost QL.

Sb2Te3, but exceeding the expected ∼ 2 QL penetration
depth of the TSSs in an isolated Bi2Te3 slab (see Fig-
ure 13). This is in agreement with previous results31,32
in which similar TISs with large penetration depths ap-
pear in NI/TI junctions localized in the NI. We addi-
tionally checked that in NI/TI/NI heterojunctions of m-
Sb2Te3/n-Bi2Te3/m-Sb2Te3 with n as low as 1 QL, the
TISs are always gapless in slab conﬁguration, and remain
gapless in superlattice geometries as long as m > 2. Note
that Bi2Te3 here is the TI, and 1 QL Bi2Te3 thin ﬁlms
show a relatively large Dirac gap due to surface–surface
hybridization. Therefore, capping Bi2Te3 with uniaxially
strained Sb2Te3 leads to a closing of the Dirac gap in the
topological states, since the latter localizes in the normal
insulating Sb2Te3.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have shown the combined eﬀects of uniaxial and bi-
axial strain on Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3, both
in bulk and slab geometries. A phase diagram for the four
systems was computed and analyzed, demonstrating that
topological phase transitions can occur for diﬀerent com-
binations of both kinds of strains, and a universal behav-
ior was found for the four compounds. We showed how
strain can engineer the DP energy, the Fermi velocity,
the metallic character and the topology of the four com-
pounds, thus oﬀering a wide tunability regarding strain-
tronics. We have also calculated the electronic structure
of Sb2Te3/Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 trilayers, in which Sb2Te3 was
driven into the topologically trivial insulating regime by
applying uniaxial strain. For the TI/TI systems no trivial
nor topological interface state is found, and the superlat-
tice shows a straddling gap of ∼ 0.1 eV. In the NI/TI
heterojunctions, topologically protected interface states
are predicted and characterized. We ﬁnd TISs to localize
in the NI, thus opening a route to closing hybridization
gaps in topological states of ultrathin ﬁlms of the Bi2Se3
family by capping the system with NI layers. Our re-
sults for the NI/TI heterojunctions also indicate a way
to avoid interactions of the topological states with unde-
sired ambient impurities while preserving the bulk band
gap of the system, and thus maintaining the topological
protection of the states. Uniaxial strain on the Sb2Te3
subsystem can additionally turn the interface conduct-
ing channel on or oﬀ, thus the system host a switchable
topological interface state irrespective of the thickness of
the TI layer.

that form the NI/TI/NI trilayers. (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e)
show the band dispersion for Sb2Te3 slabs of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6
QLs respectively. Uniaxial tensile strain of ∼ 10% has been
applied in the ﬁve cases. (f) corresponds to a 6 QL Bi2Te3 thin
ﬁlm under biaxial compressive strain so that its in–plane lat-
tice parameter matches that of equilibrium Sb2Te3 (4.25 ˚A).
Sb2Te3 is clearly in the normal insulating phase, as no surface
state develops for thicknesses as large as 6 QLs.

FIG. 11. Band structure of the m-Sb2Te3/n-Bi2Te3/m-
Sb2Te3 trilayers considered. (a), (b) and (c) show the band
dispersion for the superlattices with n=6 and m = 1, 2, and
3 respectively. As the Sb2Te3 subsystem has been driven
to the normal insulating phase by applying uniaxial tensile
tension, topologically protected states localized at the inter-
face appear, according to the bulk–to–boundary correspon-
dence. A gap in the spectrum opens for m below ∼ 2 due to
interface–interface interaction (note that the total thickness
of the Sb2Te3 subsystem is 2mQLs in the superlattices) (d),
(e) and (f) correspond to slab geometries with n=6 and m =
1, 2, and 3 respectively. In these three cases a surface state
develops irrespective of the number of Sb2Te3 layers, but no
interface state is present.

Bi2Te3/m-Sb2Te3 trilayer slabs for m=1 (red line at the bot-
tom), m=2 (magenta line in the middle) and m=3 (blue line
at the top). The LDOS was computed at k=(5, 0) ·10−3˚A−1,
along the ¯Γ– ¯K direction and close to the ¯Γ point for the
electron–like TSSs. The trilayer is centered at the middle
of the 6 QL Bi2Te3 layer. Vertical dashed lines depict the
boundaries of each QL. The gray shaded region corresponds
to the Sb2Te3 subsystem, while white regions belong to the
Bi2Te3 subsystem and the vacuum is shaded with a cyan pat-
tern. (a) shows the TI/TI/TI trilayer for which TSSs localize
at the surfacemost QL of the Sb2Te3 which is in the topo-
logical insulating phase. In (b) the LDOS of the NI/TI/NI
trilayer is shown. In this case TISs localize at both interfacial
QLs, one in the Bi2Te3 subsystem and the other in the Sb2Te3
subsystem, being the latter in the NI phase. The extension
of the TISs spans the whole trivial Sb2Te3 subsystem.

superlattices for m=1 (red line at the bottom), m=2 (magenta
line in the middle) and m=3 (blue line at the top) –note that
the total thickness of the Sb2Te3 subsystem is 2mQLs–. The
LDOS was computed at k=(5, 0) ·10−3˚A−1, along the ¯Γ– ¯K
direction and close to the ¯Γ point for the electron–like TISs.
The system is centered at the middle of the 6 QL Bi2Te3
layer. Vertical dashed lines depict the boundaries of each QL.
The gray shaded region corresponds to the Sb2Te3 subsystem,
while white regions belong to the Bi2Te3 subsystem. TISs of
NI/TI superlattices exhibit strong hybridization with the op-
posite interface for thicknesses of the 2m–Sb2Te3 layer below
m=2 QLs, while for the m=3 QLs the TISs are already de-
coupled. All three TISs shown are degenerate due to inversion
symmetry, and only one of the two–fold degenerate states is
shown in each case.
