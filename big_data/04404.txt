Abstract—This paper compares three candidate large-scale
propagation path loss models for use over the entire microwave and
millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio spectrum: the alpha-beta-gamma
(ABG) model, the close-in (CI) free space reference distance model,
and the CI model with a frequency-weighted path loss exponent
(CIF). Each of these models have been recently studied for use
in standards bodies such as 3GPP, and for use in the design of
ﬁfth generation (5G) wireless systems in urban macrocell, urban
microcell, and indoor ofﬁce and shopping mall scenarios. Here
we compare the accuracy and sensitivity of these models using
measured data from 30 propagation measurement datasets from 2
GHz to 73 GHz over distances ranging from 4 m to 1238 m. A series
of sensitivity analyses of the three models show that the physically-
based two-parameter CI model and three-parameter CIF model
offer computational simplicity, have very similar goodness of ﬁt (i.e.,
the shadow fading standard deviation), exhibit more stable model
parameter behavior across frequencies and distances, and yield
smaller prediction error in sensitivity testing across distances and
frequencies, when compared to the four-parameter ABG model.
Results show the CI model with a 1 m close-in reference distance
is suitable for outdoor environments, while the CIF model is more
appropriate for indoor modeling. The CI and CIF models are
easily implemented in existing 3GPP models by making a very
subtle modiﬁcation — by replacing a ﬂoating non-physically based
constant with a frequency-dependent constant that represents free
space path loss in the ﬁrst meter of propagation. This paper shows
this subtle change offers much easier analysis, intuitive appeal,
better model parameter stability, and better accuracy in sensitivity
tests over a vast range of microwave and mmWave frequencies,
scenarios and distances, while using a simpler model with fewer
parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION

The rapidly increasing demands for higher mobile data rates
and ubiquitous data access have led to a spectrum crunch over
the traditional wireless communication frequency bands, i.e.,
below 6 GHz. Innovative technologies such as multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) [5]–[7], and new spectrum allocations
in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency bands [8], are
useful to alleviate the current spectrum shortage [9], and are
driving the development of the ﬁfth-generation (5G) wireless
communications. It is necessary to have a good knowledge of
the propagation channel characteristics across all microwave and
mmWave frequencies in order to conduct accurate and reliable
5G system design.

is critical

Emerging 5G communication systems are expected to employ
revolutionary technologies [10], potential new spectra [11], and
novel architectural concepts [5], [6], hence it
to
develop reliable channel models to assist engineers in the design.
Channel characterization at both mmWave and centimeter-wave
(cmWave) bands has been conducted by many prior researchers
[12], [13]. For instance, wideband non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
channels at 9.6, 28.8, and 57.6 GHz in downtown Denver were
measured in [14]; Lovnes et al. and Smulders et al. performed
outdoor propagation measurements and modeling at the 60 GHz
band in a variety of city streets [15], [16]. Over the past few
years, a number of measurement campaigns, prototypes, or
modeling work for mmWave channels for future mobile commu-
nications have been conducted by Nokia [17], [18] and Samsung
[19], [20]; Kyro et al. from Aalto University performed channel
measurements at 81 GHz to 86 GHz of the E-band for point-to-
point communications in a street canyon scenario in Helsinki,
Finland [21]. Additionally, extensive propagation measurements
and channel modeling were carried out at 28 GHz, 38 GHz, 60
GHz, and 73 GHz in urban microcell (UMi), urban macrocell
(UMa), and indoor hotspot (InH) scenarios [8], [22]–[24]. Note
that for the UMi scenario, the base station (BS) antenna is at
rooftop height, typically 10 m or so above ground as deﬁned in
[25], [26]; while for the UMa scenario, the BS antenna is above
rooftop height, typically 25 m or so above ground as deﬁned
in [25], [26]. Raw data representing corresponding measured
path loss data for the indoor and outdoor measurements were
provided in [1] and [27]. Large-scale path loss models at 38 GHz
and 60 GHz were published for urban outdoor environments in
Austin, Texas [28], [29]. Directional and omnidirectional path
loss models in dense urban environments at 28 GHz and 73 GHz

were presented in [30], [31]. Spatial and temporal statistics based
on UMi measurements at 28 GHz and 73 GHz were extracted in
combination with ray-tracing [24], [32]. Two-dimensional (2D)
and 3D statistical spatial channel models for across the mmWave
bands were developed in [32], [33].

3GPP [25] and WINNER II [34] channel models are the most
well-known and widely employed models in industry, containing
a diversity of deployment scenarios such as UMi, UMa, indoor
ofﬁce, indoor shopping mall, etc., and they provide key channel
parameters including line-of-sight (LOS) probabilities, path loss
models, path delays, and path powers. However, the 3GPP and
WINNER channel models are only applicable for frequency
bands below 6 GHz; hence all of the modeling methodologies
need to be revisited and revised for frequency bands above 6
GHz [12], [13]. In addition, as discussed subsequently, a three-
parameter ﬂoating-intercept (alpha-beta (AB)) large-scale path
loss model was adopted by 3GPP and WINNER, which offers
a standard model but lacks solid physical meaning due to its
widely varying (ﬂoating) modeling parameters when applied in
a particular band of frequencies or scenario [3].

This paper investigates three large-scale path loss models that
may be used over the microwave and mmWave frequency bands:
the alpha-beta-gamma (ABG) model, the close-in (CI) free space
reference distance path loss model, and the CI model with a
frequency-weighted path loss exponent (CIF) [1], [3], [4], [35]–
[37], which is a general form of the CI model. The ABG model is
shown to be a simple extension of the AB model currently used
in 3GPP, where a frequency-dependent ﬂoating optimization
parameter is added to the AB model. We also show that the CI
and CIF models are simpler in form (require fewer parameters),
and offer better parameter stability and accuracy through the use
of a physically-based close-in reference distance that replaces
the ﬂoating model parameters of the ABG model. In this work,
systematic comparisons between the parameters, shadow fading
(SF) standard deviations, and prediction performance of these
three models in the UMa, UMi street canyon (SC), InH ofﬁce,
and InH shopping mall (SM) scenarios are provided, using eight
sets of measurement data from New York University (NYU), two
sets from The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), eight
sets from Nokia/Aalborg University (AAU), and 12 sets from
Qualcomm.

II. OVERVIEW OF THE MEASUREMENT CAMPAIGNS

A. UMa Measurements at Aalborg University

UMa propagation measurements were performed in Vestby,
Aalborg, Denmark, in the 2 GHz, 10 GHz, 18 GHz, and 28 GHz
frequency bands in March 2015 [38], [39]. Vestby represents a
typical medium-sized European city with regular building height
and street width, which is approximately 17 m (5 ﬂoors) and 20
m, respectively. There were six transmitter (TX) locations, with
a TX antenna height of 20 or 25 m. A narrowband continuous
wave (CW) signal was transmitted at 10, 18 and 28 GHz, and
another CW signal at 2 GHz was always transmitted in parallel
and served as a reference. The eight different sets of data
at different frequencies were measured at identical locations.
The receiver (RX) was mounted on a van, with a height of
approximately 2.4 m. It has been shown in [23] that a 4 m RX
height may be expected to have comparable path loss to a lower
height of 2 m in urban settings, hence the results obtained by

using the 2.4 m-high RX in the UMa measurements should be
comparable to those using an RX at typical mobile heights. The
van was driven at a speed of 20 km/h within the experimental
area, and the driving routes were chosen so that they were
conﬁned within the HPBW of the TX antennas. The received
signal strength and GPS location were recorded at a rate of
20 samples/s using the R&S TSMW Universal Radio Network
Analyzer for the calculation of path loss and TX-RX (T-R)
separation distances. The data points were visually classiﬁed
into LOS and NLOS conditions based on Google Maps.

B. UMa Measurements at UT Austin

In the summer of 2011, 38 GHz propagation measurements
were conducted with four TX locations chosen on buildings at
the UT Austin campus [22], [24], [39], using a spread spectrum
sliding correlator channel sounder and directional steerable high-
gain horn antennas, with a center carrier frequency of 37.625
GHz, a maximum RF transmit power of 21.2 dBm over an 800
MHz ﬁrst null-to-null RF bandwidth and a maximum measurable
dynamic range of 160 dB. The measurements used narrowbeam
TX antennas (7.8◦ azimuth half-power beamwidth (HPBW)) and
narrowbeam (7.8◦ azimuth HPBW) or widebeam (49.4◦ azimuth
HPBW) RX antennas. Among the four TX sites, three were with
heights of 23 m or 36 m, representing the typical heights of base
stations in the UMa scenario, and all the RX sites had a height
of 1.5 m (representing typical mobile heights). A total of 33
TX-RX location combinations were measured using the narrow-
beam RX antenna (with 3D T-R separation distances ranging
from 61 m to 930 m) and 15 TX-RX location combinations
were measured using the widebeam RX antenna (with 3D T-R
separation distances between 70 m and 728 m) for the UMa
scenario, where for each TX-RX location combination, power
delay proﬁles (PDPs) for several TX and RX antenna azimuth
and elevation pointing angle combinations were recorded. Raw
path loss data from the 38 GHz measurement campaign are
provided in [27]. This paper uses two measurement datasets
comprised of all measurement data using narrowbeam antennas
(21 LOS omnidirectional locations, and 12 NLOS locations).

C. UMi and InH Measurements at NYU

UMi and InH ofﬁce channel measurements were conducted
by NYU at 28 GHz and 73 GHz [1], [8], [23], [24], using a 400
Megachips-per-second (Mcps) spread spectrum sliding correlator
channel sounder and directional steerable horn antennas at
both the TX and RX. The raw data contained in the eight
datasets of outdoor and indoor 28 GHz and 73 GHz path loss
measurements are given in [1], [27]. Detailed information about
the measurement equipment, measurement procedures, and some
measurement results are available in [1], [8], [23], [24].

D. UMi and InH Measurements at Qualcomm

For both the UMi and InH measurements conducted by Qual-
comm, a channel sounder operating at 2.9 GHz, 29 GHz, and
61 GHz was used. The time resolution of the channel sounder
is approximately 5 ns. Omnidirectional antennas were employed
for the 2.9 GHz measurements, while directional antennas with
gains of 10 dBi and 20 dBi at 29 GHz and 61 GHz were used
for scans in both azimuth 360◦ and in elevation from -30◦ to

+90◦. The resultant scan includes 39 slices with a 10 dBi-gain
antenna and 331 slices with a 20 dBi-gain antenna.

For the outdoor measurement campaign by Qualcomm, the
environment included ofﬁce campus around 500 Somerset Cor-
porate Boulevard in Bridgewater, NJ. Two datasets were mea-
sured from the site including ﬁve multi-level buildings, two
parking lots and connecting streets and walkways and nearby
large shopping mall, all surrounded by dense rows of trees (a
mix of deciduous trees and dense spruce). T-R distance varied
between 35 m and 260 m.

The InH ofﬁce measurements were conducted on two typical
ofﬁce ﬂoors, one ﬂoor had mostly cubical ofﬁces with some
closed wall ofﬁces centrally located, and the other contained
closed wall ofﬁces and long corridors. Four datasets were
measured at three TX locations were used with about 40 RX
locations per TX on average, with a minimum distance of about
5 m, and a maximum distance of 67 m. For the InH SM
measurements, three TX locations were used with about 135 RX
locations on three ﬂoors from which six datasets were obtained,
where the minimum distance was about 10 m, and maximum
distance was about 275 m.

III. LARGE-SCALE PROPAGATION PATH LOSS MODELS

The ABG, CI and CIF path loss models are multi-frequency
statistical (i.e., stochastic) models that describe large-scale prop-
agation path loss over distance at all relevant frequencies in
a certain scenario [1], [4]. It will be noted that the CI and
CIF models have a very similar form compared to the existing
3GPP path loss model (i.e., the ﬂoating-intercept, or AB model)
[25], where one merely needs to substitute the ﬂoating constant
(which has been shown to vary substantially across different
measurements, frequencies and scenarios [2], [3]) with a free-
space constant that is a function of frequency based on a 1 m
standard free space reference distance. As shown subsequently,
this subtle change provides a frequency-dependent term while
yielding greater prediction accuracy and better parameter stabil-
ity when using the models outside of the range of the measured
dataset from which the models are developed.

We note that testing the efﬁcacy of a path loss model outside
of the range for which measurements are originally collected
and used to solve for model parameters is a critical, but often
ignored, test. Testing model accuracy and parameter stability is
needed since engineers will inevitably require propagation mod-
els for new applications, distances, or scenarios not originally
contemplated in the original experiments used to build the path
loss model. For future 5G wireless system level and link layer
analysis and simulation in new spectrum bands, where new types
of directional antennas, umbrella cells, repeater architectures,
and new regulations and network topologies are used [11], it
is critical to know that a chosen model can be used in new
scenarios while still exhibiting parameter stability, accuracy,
and usefulness beyond the limited original number of ﬁeld
measurements. This paper offers such sensitivity and analysis
when comparing the three candidate 5G stochastic path loss
models.

The equation for the ABG model is given by (1):

PLABG(f, d)[dB] =10αlog10(cid:18) d

1 m(cid:19) + β
1 GHz(cid:19) + χABG

σ

+ 10γlog10(cid:18) f

(1)

,

where d ≥ 1 m

σ

where PLABG(f, d) denotes the path loss in dB over frequency
and distance, α and γ are coefﬁcients showing the dependence
of path loss on distance and frequency, respectively, β is an
optimized offset value for path loss in dB, d is the 3D T-
R separation distance in meters, f is the carrier frequency
in GHz, and χABG
is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable
with a standard deviation σ in dB describing large-scale signal
ﬂuctuations (i.e., shadowing) about the mean path loss over
distance. Note that the ABG model has three model parameters
for determining mean path loss over distance and frequency,
as well as the shadowing standard deviation (a total of four
parameters). When used at a single frequency, the ABG model
reverts to the existing 3GPP ﬂoating-intercept (AB) model with
three parameters with γ set to 0 or 2 [24], [34], [35]. The
ABG model parameters α, β, γ, and σ are obtained from
measured data using the closed-form solutions that minimize
the SF standard deviation, as shown in the Appendix.
The equation for the CI model is given by (2) [40]:

PLCI(f, d)[dB] =FSPL(f, d0)[dB] + 10nlog10 (d/d0) + χCI
σ ,

where d ≥ d0

(2)
where d0 is the close-in free space reference distance, n denotes
the path loss exponent (PLE), and χCI
σ is a zero-mean Gaussian
random variable with a standard deviation σ in dB. Whereas the
ABG model requires four parameters, the CI model only requires
one parameter, the PLE, to determine the mean path loss with
distance and frequency, and uses a total of two parameters (the
PLE n and χCI
σ ). A useful property of (2) is that 10n describes
path loss in dB in terms of decades of distances beginning at d0
(making it very easy to compute power over distance in one’s
mind when d0 is set to 1 m [3], [4], [24]). In (2), d is the 3D
T-R separation distance, and FSPL(f, d0) denotes the free space
path loss in dB at a T-R separation distance of d0 at the carrier
frequency f :

c (cid:19)
FSPL(f, d0)[dB] = 20log10(cid:18) 4πf d0

(3)

where c is the speed of light. Note that the CI model inherently
has an intrinsic frequency dependency of path loss already
embedded within the FSPL term. The PLE model parameter
in (2) is obtained by ﬁrst removing the FSPL given by (3)
from the path loss on the left side of (2) for all measured
data points across all frequencies, and then calculating the
single PLE jointly for multiple frequencies, as detailed in the
Appendix and [24]. The choice of d0 = 1 m as the close-in
free space reference distance is shown here to provide excellent
parameter stability and model accuracy for outdoor UMi and
UMa, and indoor channels across a vast range of microwave
and mmWave frequencies, and creates a standardized modeling
approach. While the choice of a close-in reference distance of
1 m may be in the near-ﬁeld of large antenna arrays, the error

caused by this in practical wireless system design is negligible,
as shown subsequently and in [24].

A recent path loss model also suitable for multi-frequency
modeling follows as a more general form of the CI model, and
is called the CIF model, given by Eq. (4) when d0 = 1 m [1]:

PLCIF(f, d)[dB] =FSPL(f, 1 m)[dB]+

10n(cid:18)1 + b(cid:16) f − f0

f0 (cid:17)(cid:19)log10 (d) + χCIF

σ

where d ≥ 1 m

,

(4)
where n denotes the distance dependence of path loss (similar
to the PLE in the CI model), and b is a model parameter that
captures the amount of linear frequency dependence of path loss
about the weighted average of all frequencies considered in the
model. The parameter f0 is a reference frequency calculated
by (5) that is an input parameter computed from the measure-
ment set used to form the model, and serves as the balancing
point for the linear frequency dependence of the PLE:

f0 = PK
PK

k=1 fkNk
k=1 Nk

(5)

σ

where K is the number of unique frequencies, Nk is the number
of path loss data points corresponding to the kth frequency fk,
and χCIF
in (4) is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable with a
standard deviation σ in dB that describes large-scale shadowing.
Note that the calculated f0 is rounded to the nearest integer
in GHz in this work. The CIF model reverts to the CI model
for the single frequency case (when f0 is equal to the single
frequency f ) or when b = 0 (i.e., when there is no frequency
dependence on path loss, besides that which occurs in the ﬁrst
meter of free space propagation). As shown subsequently, UMa
channels modeled by CIF have a value of b very close to zero,
indicating that almost all of the frequency-dependent effects are
incorporated in the ﬁrst meter of free space propagation [1],
[24].

The CI and CIF models provide a close-in free space anchor
point which assures that the path loss model (regardless of trans-
mit power) always has a physical tie and continuous relationship
to the transmitted power over distance, whereas the AB and ABG
models use a ﬂoating constant based on a ﬁt to the data, without
consideration for the close-in free space propagation that always
occurs in practice near an antenna out in the open (this implies
that particular measured path loss values could greatly impact
and skew the ABG path loss model parameters, since there is not
a physical anchor to assure that close-in free space transmission
occurs in the ﬁrst meter of propagation from the TX antenna).
The CI and CIF models are therefore based on fundamental
principles of wireless propagation, dating back to Friis and
Bullington, where the PLE parameter offers insight into path loss
based on the environment, having a PLE value of 2 in free space
(as shown by Friis) and a value of 4 for the asymptotic two-
ray ground bounce propagation model (as shown by Bullington)
[40]. Previous UHF (Ultra-High Frequency) and microwave
models used a close-in reference distance of 1 km or 100 m
since BS towers were tall without any nearby obstructions, and
inter-site distances were on the order of many kilometers for
those frequency bands [40], [41]. We use d0 = 1 m in 5G path
loss models since coverage distances will be shorter at higher

frequencies. Furthermore, with future small cells, BSs are likely
to be mounted closer to obstructions [8], [24]. The CI and CIF d0
=1 m reference distance is a suggested standard that ties the true
transmitted power or path loss to a convenient close-in distance,
as suggested in [24]. Standardizing to a reference distance of
1 m makes comparisons of measurements and models simple,
and provides a standard deﬁnition for the PLE, while enabling
intuition and rapid computation of path loss. Now we show with
measured data that the 1 m reference is very effective for large-
scale path loss modeling across a vast range of frequencies.

As discussed in [24], emerging mmWave mobile systems will
have very few users within a few meters of the BS antenna (in
fact, no users are likely to be in the near ﬁeld, since transmitters
will be mounted on a lamppost or ceiling), and close-in users in
the near ﬁeld will have strong signals or will be power-controlled
compared to typical users much farther from the transmitter such
that any path loss error in the near ﬁeld (between 1 m and the
Fraunhofer distance) will be very minor, and so much smaller
than the dynamic range of signals experienced by users in a
commercial system.

One may argue that a close-in reference distance other than
1 m may be a better approach to maximize model accuracy of
the CI model [42], [43]. Some of the authors of this paper, in
fact, originally used d0 values greater than 1 m in past research
in order to ensure the model would only be used in the far ﬁeld
of directional antennas [8], [28], [29], but they later found a 1
m reference was more suitable for use as a standard, due to the
fact that there was very little difference in standard deviation
when using a 1 m close-in reference distance (i.e., model error
was not signiﬁcantly different when using a different value of
d0 [24]), and given the fact that very few or any users will be
within the ﬁrst few meters of the transmitter antenna.

To compare the performance of the CI model between using
a 1 m free space reference distance and an optimized or
empirically determined free space reference distance d0, as
proposed in [42], [43], we used the 30 measurement datasets
from Nokia/AAU, UT, NYU, and Qualcomm to compare model
parameters and standard deviations. Tables I and II list
the
model parameters in the 1 m CI model as compared to the
CI model with an optimized d0 (CI-opt) at various frequencies
ranging from 2 GHz to 73 GHz for the UMa, UMi, and InH
scenarios in both LOS and NLOS environments, where the
PLE and d0 for CI-opt were jointly optimized via the MMSE
method demonstrated in the Appendix (to preclude unreasonable
d0 values caused by the sparsity of some datasets, the range
of d0 was set to 0.1 m to 50 m). All of the scattered path
loss data samples were locally averaged over 2 m distance bins
(other binning values can also be explored, and we found little
difference in results using 2, 5, or 10 m local average bins),
in order to remove the small-scale fading effects and to reduce
the difference in the number of data points across measurement
campaigns. In addition, all path loss values weaker than FSPL
at 1 m plus 100 dB were not considered for analysis, based
on the reasonable assumption that there would be fewer weaker
measurements at higher frequencies due to the greater path loss
in the ﬁrst meter, so a frequency-dependent signal threshold
was implemented to ensure that the measured datasets would
slightly emphasize more measurements at the higher frequencies,
resulting in a relatively comparable number of points for the

different frequencies from various measurement campaigns. We
note that the results of this paper were not heavily inﬂuenced
by the binning or frequency-dependent thresholding, but these
approaches were found to yield comparable coverage distances
over the multiple frequencies based on the particular antennas
and transmit powers used.

As shown in Tables I and II, for both outdoor and indoor
scenarios, the SF between using d0 = 1 m and an optimized d0
differs by no more than 0.3 dB in most cases (more than an
order of magnitude smaller than the standard deviation). Note
that the only signiﬁcant differences in error between the d0 =
1 m and the optimized d0 value occur when there are very

few measurement points, and the PLE in CI-opt generally has a
physically unreasonable value in these rare cases (e.g., the PLE
is less than 1, indicating much less loss than a metal waveguide;
or the PLE is negative, indicating decrease of path loss with
distance; or the PLE is unreasonably high). For the majority
of the measurement sets, the 1 m free space reference distance
model χσ is always within 0.1 dB of the optimized d0 model,
illustrating virtually no difference in standard deviation between
the two approaches. Therefore, the 1 m CI model provides
sufﬁciently accurate ﬁtting results compared to the CI-opt model,
and requires only one model parameter (PLE) to be optimized
by the adoption of a 1 m standard close-in free space reference

mmWave band in the indoor ofﬁce scenario [44] (both the β
and γ parameters are used for curve ﬁtting, as was done in the
WINNER ﬂoating-intercept (AB) model) [24], [34], [35]. It is
noteworthy that the ABG model is identical to the CI model if
we equate α in the ABG model in (1) with the PLE n in the
CI model in (2), γ in (1) with the free space PLE of 2, and β
in (1) with 20log10(4π × 109/c) in (3).

Using the three path loss models described above, and the
30 measurement datasets over a wide range of microwave and
mmWave frequencies (2 to 73 GHz) and distances (4 to 1238
m), we computed the path loss model parameters for the three
models. The PLE in the CI model, the n and b in the CIF model,
and the α, β, and γ parameters in the ABG model were all
calculated via the MMSE ﬁt on all of the path loss data from all
measured frequencies and distances for a given scenario (UMa,
UMi, or InH), using closed-form solutions that minimize the
SF standard deviation, as detailed in the Appendix. In order
to focus solely on the comparison of propagation models, we
separated LOS and NLOS measurements, and did not include
the probabilities of LOS or NLOS, although we note that such
probability models as described in [24], [25], [31], [45]–[47]
may exploit the results of this work.

Figs. 1 - 3 show scatter plots of all the datasets optimized for
the ABG, CIF, and CI models in the UMa scenario in the NLOS
environment, respectively. Table III summarizes the path loss
parameters in the ABG, CI, and CIF models for the UMa, UMi,
and InH scenarios in both LOS and NLOS environments. As
shown in Table III, the CI and CIF models each provide a PLE
of 2.0, 2.1, 1.5, and 1.9 in the LOS environment for the UMa,
UMi SC, InH ofﬁce and InH SM scenarios, respectively, which
agrees well with a free space PLE of 2 in UMa, UMi SC, and
InH SM settings, or models the waveguiding effects in the InH
ofﬁce scenario, respectively. Although the CI and CIF models
yield slightly higher SF standard deviation than the ABG model
in most cases, this increased standard deviation is usually a
fraction of a dB and is within standard measurement error arising
from frequency and temperature drift, connector and cable ﬂex

distance, while the CI-opt model requires two model parameters
(PLE and d0) for modeling the mean path loss over distance,
and sometimes yields unrealistic PLEs and reference distances.
For the remainder of this paper, the CI model (2) is assumed to
use d0 = 1 m, as suggested in [24].

The ABG (1), CI (2) and CIF (4) models with d0 = 1 m
are a function of both distance and frequency, where the CI and
CIF models have frequency dependence expressed primarily by
the frequency-dependent FSPL term (3) in the ﬁrst meter of free
space propagation. While the ABG model offers some physical
basis in the α term, being based on a 1 m reference distance
similar to the n term in (2) and (4), it departs from physics when
introducing both an offset β (which is an optimization parameter
that is not physically based), and a frequency weighting term γ
that has no proven physical basis, although recent measurements
show that the path loss increases with frequency across the

variations, and calibration errors in an actual measurement
campaign. Notably, these errors are often an order of magnitude
less than the corresponding actual SF standard deviations in
all three models. It is noteworthy that the CIF model even
renders lower SF standard deviations than the ABG model for
the LOS InH ofﬁce and NLOS InH SM scenarios, indicating
the greater accuracy of CIF compared to ABG in these settings,
even though the CIF model has fewer optimization parameters.
Furthermore, for the UMa and LOS UMi SC scenarios, the
CI and CIF models always yield identical PLEs and standard
deviations for the same dataset, and the b parameter in the CIF
model is virtually zero. For the NLOS UMi SC, and InH SM
scenarios, the b in the CIF model is positive, implying that path
loss increases with frequency beyond the ﬁrst meter of free space
propagation in these cases, but more data may be needed to
verify the phenomenon.

Table IV lists the model parameters in the ABG and CI models
at different frequencies in the NLOS environment for the UMa
and UMi scenarios, with the last line for each scenario showing
the parameters for the multi-frequency model. Note that for
single frequencies, γ in the ABG model is set to 2, thus reverting
to the AB model used in 3GPP and WINNER II channel models
[25], [34], [46], and the CIF model reverts to the CI model.
Fig. 4 illustrates a useful example of the CI and ABG models
as compared to ideal free space path loss at 28 GHz for the
UMa NLOS environment, using the parameters for 2 - 38 GHz
in Table IV. Fig. 4 is useful since it shows how any one of
the three path loss models might be used at a particular single
frequency in wireless system design, after the multi-frequency
model had been developed using a wide range of data over a
vast range of frequencies (in this case, the four measurement
datasets for the UMa scenario listed in Table IV).

A few key observations can be obtained from these ﬁgures and
Table IV. First, the α and β parameters in the AB model can vary
as widely as 2.5 and 49.7 dB across frequencies, respectively,
as shown in Table IV. The large variation of α and β in the AB
model was also observed in [24]. Second, the PLE n in the CI
model varies only marginally for the single frequency case, with
a largest variation of merely 0.5 for all the scenarios. The SF
standard deviations for the CI and ABG models differ by only
a fraction of a dB over all frequencies and distances in most
cases, and the difference is less than an order of magnitude of
the SF for either model, making the models virtually identical in
accuracy over frequency and distance. There is a case for UMi
where the ABG model has 1.2 dB lower SF standard deviation
than the CI model, but there are only 82 data points in this case,
and recent work using a much larger dataset showed only 0.4 dB
difference (8.2 dB for CI and 7.8 dB for ABG) for the UMi SC
NLOS scenario [12], and this difference is more than an order
of magnitude smaller than either standard deviation.

As shown in Fig. 4, the parameters derived from 2 to 38
GHz for the UMa NLOS environment, when applied at 28 GHz,
indicate that the ABG model underestimates path loss to be
much less than free space when very close to the transmitter.
Even more importantly, the ﬂoating-intercept ABG model over-
estimates path loss (i.e., underestimates interference) at greater
distances compared with the CI model at far distances [24].
These divergent modeling results are clearly seen when com-
paring the path loss distance end-points on Figs. 1 and 3. The

Example comparison of free space, CI and ABG path loss models
at 28 GHz for the UMa NLOS environment using the parameters derived with
measurements from 2 - 38 GHz in Table III. Note how the ABG model estimates
5 dB less signal power (i.e., 5 dB less out-of-cell interference) at 1 km when
compared to CI.

CI model is thus more conservative when analyzing interference-
limited systems at larger distances, and more realistic when
modeling signal strengths at close-in distances.

From the above analysis, the CI model provides more stability
σ ) across wide ranges
using fewer parameters (i.e., PLE and χCI
of frequencies with only a fraction of a dB higher SF standard
deviation in most cases when compared to the four-parameter
ABG model. The CI model is anchored to FSPL in the ﬁrst
meter, and gives intuitive meaning through the PLE parameter,
since 10n mathematically describes the path loss in dB with
respect to a decade increase of distance beginning at 1 m,
making it very easy to compute power or path loss over distance.
Only a very subtle change is needed to the AB/ABG model to
implement the simpler CI/CIF model, i.e., replacing the ﬂoating
intercept parameter with a FSPL term that is physically based
and is inherently a function of frequency. While Tables III and IV
show how the ABG, CI, and CIF models all provide comparable
curve ﬁtting standard deviations over a wide frequency range,
we now show that the CI and CIF models offer superior accuracy
and reliability when subject to extensive sensitivity analyses.

IV. PREDICTION AND SENSITIVITY PERFORMANCE

This section investigates the prediction accuracy and sensi-
tivity of the three path loss models, i.e., ABG, CI and CIF.
Because of the vast number of experimental data points provided
by the authors, it was possible to test the efﬁcacy of the path loss
models in situations where they are used outside of the particular
frequencies, locations, or distances. Prediction performance and
model sensitivity were tested by creating path loss models using
a subset of the measurements (to obtain the optimized model
parameters) and then testing those resulting models against the
other subset of measurements (which were outside of the datasets
used to generate the original model parameters). This test is
needed to establish whether engineers could use the models with
conﬁdence in new scenarios or distances or frequencies different
than what were used to form the original models. If future
systems use more transmit power or have greater range than the

measurement systems used to derive the model parameters, or
are to be used at different frequencies than what were measured
to produce the models, a sensitivity analysis such as this is
critical for comparing and selecting path loss models.

The measured data from all experiments for the UMa, UMi
SC, and InH ofﬁce scenarios shown in Table III are split into
two sets: a measurement set and a prediction set, where the
term measurement set refers to the set of measured data used
to compute the optimum (i.e., minimum SF standard deviation)
parameters of the path loss model, and the term prediction set
refers to a different set of measured data that is scattered about
the distance-dependent mean path loss model constructed from
the measurement set. For a speciﬁc path loss model (e.g., ABG,
CI, or CIF), the SF standard deviation is calculated using the
measured data in the prediction set as distributed about the
distance-dependent mean path loss model constructed from the
measurement set. As the measurement set varies with distance,
frequency, or city, as explained below, the optimized model
parameters computed from the measurement set, as well as the
SF standard deviation for the prediction set (i.e., the prediction
error), also change. Therefore, two types of comparisons are
simultaneously performed as the measurement set varies: ﬁrst,
the SF standard deviation for the prediction set about the model
formed from the measurement set is computed and compared
for each of the three path loss models in order to compare
the accuracy for each model under identical measurement set
conditions; second, the optimized model parameters from the
measurement set are determined and compared between the three
path loss models, to determine the sensitivity and stability of
the model parameters over different sets of measurement data.
Only the NLOS data are used in this prediction performance
and sensitivity study, since NLOS environments offer greater
variability, higher SF standard deviation, and are most likely to
produce errors in 5G analysis and simulation.

A. Prediction in Distance

In this subsection, the total dataset of each of the UMa, UMi
SC, and InH ofﬁce NLOS data of Table III is used and broken up
into a measurement set and a prediction set based on distance.
The prediction set was kept ﬁxed in this investigation and the
measurement sets were varied over distance, where the optimum
model parameters (corresponding to the minimum SF standard
deviation) were computed for each speciﬁc measurement set.
The measurement sets included measured data at distances which
kept getting further away from the prediction set.

The ﬁrst investigation of this experiment is for the case when
the prediction set contains measurement points that are closer
to the TX (base station) than the measurement set. In this case,
the prediction set is all the measured data with distances smaller
than or equal to dmax = 200 m, and the measurement sets varied
to include all distances greater than dmax + δd (δd > 0). Fig. 5
and Fig. 6 show the prediction errors and parameter variations
of the ABG, CI, and CIF models for prediction in distance in
the UMa scenario. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the prediction error
of the CIF model generally increases with the increase of the
distance between the two datasets. However, remarkably, the CI
path loss model has a constant SF standard deviation for the
prediction set, regardless of how far away the measurement set
gets. On the other hand, the SF standard deviation of the ABG

transmitter in the UMa scenario.

model over the prediction set varies substantially as δd increases.
For the CI model, the largest difference in the standard deviation
of the scattered data in the prediction set, around the optimized
model derived from the measurement set, is only 0.4 dB across
the entire range of δd (from 0 to 600 m), and about 2 dB for
the CIF model, while the standard deviation of the ABG model
reaches as high as 10.5 dB when δd = 150 m, and varies by 4.5
dB across the entire range of δd. This shows how erratic and
sensitive the ABG model is to the particular data used to create
the model parameters, and illustrates the heightened sensitivity
for certain situations when using the ABG model — no such
problems exist for the CI or CIF model. The parameter stability
of the PLE in the CI model and the n and b values in the CIF
model is much better than the parameters of the ABG model
when varying the distance between the two sets, as seen in Fig. 6.
In particular, the α of the ABG model can vary a lot (3.2 to 4.6),
which could have signiﬁcant effects in system-level simulations,
as the level of signal strength or interference greatly depends on
the value of α (i.e., the distance-related parameter). In addition,
the β of the ABG model can vary by 39.5 dB.

For the UMi scenario, the prediction set uses T-R separation
distances smaller than or equal
to 50 m, and the distance
is larger than 50 m for the measurement set; for the InH
ofﬁce scenario, the prediction set corresponds to T-R separation
distances smaller than or equal to 15 m, and the measurement
set contains data with distances larger than 15 m, considering
the generally shorter T-R separations compared to outdoor cases.
The prediction results for the UMi SC scenario are illustrated in
Figs. 7 and 8, while Figs. 9 and 10 display the prediction perfor-
mance for the InH ofﬁce scenario. As shown by Figs. 7 to 10,
the prediction error of the ABG model ﬂuctuates signiﬁcantly
and rises dramatically as the measurement set gets further away
from the prediction set, and may become incredibly high, e.g.,
over 20 dB. On the other hand, the CI and CIF models yield
low (at most 8.2 dB) and very stable prediction errors across
the entire range of δd for both UMi and InH scenarios, which
implies that the CI and CIF models are both more accurate than
the ABG model under varying datasets, and are not sensitive to
the dataset used to generate the model parameters. Similar to

the UMa case, the model parameters in the CI and CIF models
exhibit little variation, while the α and β in the ABG model
vary signiﬁcantly over the investigated range of δd.

The second investigation of this experiment is for the case that
the measurement set contains measured data closer to the TX
(base station) than the prediction set. In this case, the prediction
set contains all UMa measurements with distances larger than or
equal to dmin = 600 m, and the measurement set will vary as all
distances smaller than dmin − δd (δd > 0). The results for this
case in the UMa scenario are shown in Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 for the
SF standard deviation on the prediction set and the parameters
of the path loss models, respectively, both as a function of δd.
As shown by Fig. 11, the prediction errors of both the CI and
CIF path loss models vary very little as the distance between
the measurement set and prediction set increases, while the
prediction error of the ABG model on the prediction set exhibits
signiﬁcant variation as δd increases. Notice that the prediction
errors of both the CI and CIF models vary by up to only 1.4

dB across the entire range of δd (from 0 to 400 m); in contrast,
the prediction error of the ABG model can be as large as 16.1
dB and the maximum difference in prediction error reaches 12.5
dB across the entire range of δd. Moreover, the stabilities of the
modeling parameters in the CI and CIF models are much better
compared to those of the ABG model when varying the distance
between the two sets, as illustrated by Fig. 12, where the α and
β of the ABG model vary by 2.2 and 46.6 dB, respectively. This,
again, shows the great sensitivity and inaccuracy (gross errors)
of the ABG model to the particular data used to create the model
parameters and the remarkable accuracy and robustness of the
CI/CIF models to various measurement sets.

B. Prediction in Frequency

In this section, the prediction set will be the data for a given
frequency and the measurement set is all the other frequencies.
For example, the prediction set could be all data at 2 GHz and
the measurement set the data for all the other frequencies (10,
18, 28, and 38 GHz) for the UMa scenario.

Fig. 14. Parameters of the ABG, CI, and CIF path loss models for prediction
in frequency in the UMa scenario. The measurement set is for all frequencies
except the excluded one shown on the x axis which is the prediction set. Note
that the scale for β (dB) in the ABG model is to the right.

Fig. 13 depicts the RMS error for the three path loss models
on the prediction and measurement sets for the frequency shown
on the x axis (where the frequency on the x axis comprises all
data in the prediction set). It can be observed from Fig. 13 that
although all the three models yield varying prediction errors
across the entire frequency range, the variation is the largest for
the ABG model. The prediction error of the ABG model is much
greater (about 19 dB) at lower frequencies where legacy 4G
systems will work, showing the liability of the ABG model for
simultaneous use in lower frequency and mmWave systems. The
CI model shows the most robust and accurate prediction over
all frequencies. The parameters of the three path loss models
for prediction in frequency are shown in Fig. 14. It is obvious
from Fig. 14 that the parameters in the CI and CIF models vary
much less across frequencies as compared to the parameters in
the ABG model, demonstrating the liability of the ABG model.

C. Prediction Across Environments

Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 also show the prediction performance of
the three path loss models across environments, when consid-
ering an arbitrary single frequency, e.g., focusing on the results
associated with 38 GHz. The 2, 10, 18, and 28 GHz data were
measured in the Aalborg UMa environment, while the 38 GHz
data were obtained from the Austin UMa environment, hence
prediction results at 38 GHz actually show how the three path
loss models behave when using the Aalborg data to predict the
Austin data. As seen in Fig. 13, the prediction errors for the
CI and CIF models at 38 GHz are slightly smaller than the
ABG model, indicating that all three models yield comparable
prediction performance when applied in different cities.

These results, as well as those in [2], show superior prediction
ability and robust sensitivity of the CI path loss model for
outdoor scenarios, and the virtue of the CIF model for indoor
settings in the large majority of cases. This advantage is espe-
cially useful for 5G mmWave standardization where an accurate,
trustworthy model must be developed without the beneﬁt of a
complete set of measurements across all frequencies and all
environments, especially given the fact that future spectrum
may be allocated in bands different from what was originally
measured.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we provided a comparison of three large-scale
propagation path loss models, i.e., the ABG (four parameters),
CI (two parameters), and CIF models (three parameters), over
the microwave and mmWave frequency bands using 30 sets of
measurement data from 2 GHz to 73 GHz for UMa, UMi, and
InH scenarios.

First, comparisons were made between the 1 m CI model
and the CI model with an optimized reference distance d0
(CI-opt). Results show that the two-parameter 1 m CI model
provides virtually identical accuracy as compared to the three-
parameter CI-opt model, and the CI-opt model can sometimes
yield unrealistic PLEs. The data prove that a 1 m free space
reference distance, rather than an optimized d0, is justiﬁed for
the CI model.

Work here showed that the ABG, CI and CIF models are
all very comparable in prediction accuracy when large datasets
exist, even though the ABG model requires more model param-
eters and lacks a physical basis for its ﬂoating intercept value.
By contrast, the CI and CIF models are physically tied to the
transmitter power via the utilization of a 1 m close-in free space
reference distance that has an inherent frequency dependency
over the entire microwave and mmWave bands. This allows
for easy “in your head” computation of mean path loss at all
distances, by virtue of just a single model parameter (PLE, or
n) for the CI model (where 10n is the path loss in dB per
decade of distance beyond 1 m) and two model parameters (n
and b) for the CIF model. Only very subtle modiﬁcations to the
existing 3GPP ﬂoating-intercept (AB/ABG) path loss model are
needed to implement the CI/CIF models which provide virtually
identical accuracy compared to the four-parameter ABG model
over a vast range of frequencies — from today’s cellular to
future mmWave bands. This paper showed that the AB and
ABG models have parameter values that vary greatly across
different frequency and distance ranges, while reducing the SF

standard deviation by only a fraction of a dB in most cases
compared to the physically-based CI and CIF models that use
fewer model parameters. The single greatest difference between
standard deviations for all three models over all scenarios was
found to be 1.2 dB for the UMi scenario, where only 82 data
points were available. However, a recent study with a much
richer dataset [12] showed only 0.4 dB difference between the
ABG and CI models in UMi.

This paper showed, by way of example at 28 GHz, that the
ABG model has inherent inaccuracy at both very small (<
10 m) and very large (several hundred meters) distances, and
underestimates interference at large distances when used at an
arbitrary frequency as compared to CI. Hence, the ABG model
will lead to overly optimistic capacity simulations. Especially
for future small cell deployments, where dozens of neighboring
base stations could produce interference, the simulation results
would be vastly different between the ABG and CI/CIF models.
A key contribution of this paper was a sensitivity analysis that
showed the CI and CIF models are superior to the ABG model
in both stability performance and prediction accuracy (i.e., SF
standard deviation) over a vast frequency range, when using the
model to predict path loss at different distances and frequencies
relative to the set of data from which the parameters of the path
loss models were originally determined. Thus, for unexpected
scenarios or for situations where a path loss model may be used
at different distances or frequencies than the measurements used
to create the original model, the sensitivity analysis in this paper
shows the CI and CIF models are more robust, accurate, and
reliable as compared to the ABG model.

Finally, the CI model was shown to be most suitable for
outdoor environments because of its accuracy, simplicity, and
superior sensitivity performance due to its physical close-in free
space reference point, given the fact that measured path loss
exhibits little dependence on frequency in outdoor environments
beyond the ﬁrst meter of free space propagation (captured in the
FSPL term). On the other hand, the CIF model is well suited
for indoor environments, since it provides a smaller standard
deviation than the ABG model in many cases even with fewer
model parameters, and has superior accuracy when scrutinized
with the sensitivity analysis.

APPENDIX

Mathematical derivations for the closed-form solutions for the
ABG, CI, and CIF models, by solving for model parameters
that minimize the SF standard deviation, are provided in this
appendix.

A. ABG Path Loss Model

The ABG model can be expressed as (with 1 m reference

distance and 1 GHz reference frequency) [36]:

PLABG(f, d)[dB] =10αlog10(

d

1 m

) + β + 10γlog10(

+ χABG

σ

f

1 GHz

)

(6)

Assuming B = PLABG(f, d)[dB], D = 10log10(d), and F =
10log10(f ) in (6), the SF is given by:

χABG

σ

= B − αD − β − γF

(7)

Then the SF standard deviation is:

(8)
to minimizing

σABG = qX χABG

σ

2

/N = qX (B − αD − β − γF )2/N

Minimizing the ﬁtting error is equivalent

P (B − αD − β − γF )2, which means its partial derivatives

with respect to α, β, and γ should be zero, as shown by (9), (10),
and (11).

∂P (B − αD − β − γF )2

∂P (B − αD − β − γF )2

(17)

∂P (B − αD − β − γF )2

∂γ

=2(αX DF + βX F
−X F B)
+ γX F 2

=0

It is found from (9), (10), and (11) that

αX D2 + βX D + γX DF −X DB = 0
αX D + N β + γX F −X B = 0

αX DF + βX F + γX F 2

−X F B = 0

Through calculation and simpliﬁcation, we obtain the closed-
form solutions for α, β, and γ as shown by (12), (13), and (14),
respectively. Finally, the minimum SF standard deviation for the
ABG model can be obtained by plugging (12), (13), and (14)
back into (8).

B. CI Path Loss Model with Optimized Free Space Reference
Distance

The expression for the CI model with a reference distance of

d0 is given by [24]:

PLCI(f, d)[dB] =20log10(cid:18) 4πf d0
=20log10(cid:18) 4πf

c (cid:19) + 10nlog10(cid:18) d
d0(cid:19) + χCI
c (cid:19) + 20log10(d0) + 10nlog10(d)

σ

− 10nlog10(d0) + χCI
σ

Thus the SF is:

χCI

σ =PLCI(f, d)[dB] − 20log10(cid:18) 4πf

c (cid:19) − 20log10(d0)

− 10nlog10(d) + 10nlog10(d0)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

Let A = PLCI(f, d)[dB] − 20log10(cid:16) 4πf

D = 10log10(d), then we have

c (cid:17), B = 10log10(d0),

χCI

σ =A − 2B − nD + nB = A − nD − (2 − n)B

=A − nD − b

where b = (2 − n)B. Then the SF standard deviation is:

σCI = qX χCI

σ

2

/N = qX (A − nD − b)2/N

where N is the number of path loss data points. Thus minimizing
the SF standard deviation σCI is equivalent to minimizing the

term P (A − nD − b)2. When P (A − nD − b)2 is minimized,

its derivatives with respect to n and b should be zero, i.e.,

dP (A − nD − b)2

dn

= X 2D(nD + b − A) = 0

dP (A − nD − b)2

db

= X 2(nD + b − A) = 0

By jointly solving (22) and (23) we can obtain

n = P AP D − N P DA
(P D)2 − N P D2
b = P A − nP D

N

d0 = 10B/10 = 10

P A−n P D

i.e.,

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

C. CI Path Loss Model with 1 m Free Space Reference Distance
The expression for the CI model with a reference distance of

1 m is given by [24]:

PLCI(f, d)[dB] = FSPL(f, 1 m)[dB] + 10nlog10(d) + χCI
σ
(27)

where

FSPL(f, 1 m)[dB] = 20log10(cid:18) 4πf
c (cid:19)

(28)

Thus the SF is:

σ = PLCI(f, d)[dB] − FSPL(f, 1 m)[dB] − 10nlog10(d)
χCI

= A − nD

(29)

where A represents PLCI(f, d)[dB] − FSPL(f, 1 m)[dB], and
D denotes 10log10(d). Then the SF standard deviation is:

σCI = qX χCI

σ

2

/N = qX (A − nD)2/N

(30)

where N is the number of path loss data points. Thus minimizing
to minimizing
the SF standard deviation σCI is equivalent

the term P (A − nD)2. When P (A − nD)2 is minimized, its

derivative with respect to n should be zero, i.e.,

dP (A − nD)2

dn

= X 2D(nD − A) = 0

Therefore, from (31) we have

n = P DA
P D2

(P DP B − N P DB)((P F )2 − N P F 2) − (P DP F − N P DF )(P F P B − N P F B)

β =

((P D)2 − N P D2)(P DP F 2 −P F P DF ) + (P DP F − N P DF )(P F P D2 −P DP DF )

(13)

γ =

(P F P B − N P F B)((P D)2 − N P D2) − (P DP F − N P DF )(P DP B − N P DB)

((P F )2 − N P F 2)((P D)2 − N P D2) − (P DP F − N P DF )2

(14)

(41)

D. CIF Path Loss Model

The equation of the CIF model (4) with a reference distance

of 1 m is re-organized in the form:

PLCIF(f, d)[dB] =FSPL(f, 1 m)[dB]

g = P D2f P DA −P D2P DAf
(P D2f )2 −P D2P D2f 2

Put into matrix form, a and g are:

+ 10log10(d)(n(1 − b) +

f ) + X CIF

σ

a =

f T diag(DDT )f T diag(DAT ) − (diag(f f T ))T diag(DDT )DT A

(f T diag(DDT ))2

− (diag(f f T ))T diag(DDT )DT D

(42)

where n is the PLE that includes the frequency-effect param-
eter b, and f0 is the speciﬁed reference frequency that may
be selected as the average of all measured frequencies. Let
A = PLCIF(f, d)[dB] − FSPL(f, 1 m)[dB], D = 10log10(d),
a = n(1 − b), and g = nb
f0

, then we have:

X CIF

σ = A − D(a + gf )

(34)

The SF standard deviation is:

=2(aX D2f + gX D2f 2
−X DAf )

which can be simpliﬁed to:

aX D2 + gX D2f −X DA = 0
−X DAf = 0
aX D2f + gX D2f 2

Combining (38) and (39) yields:

a = P D2f P DAf −P D2f 2P DA

(P D2f )2 −P D2P D2f 2

(40)

g =

f T diag(DDT )DT A − f T diag(DAT )DT D

(f T diag(DDT ))2

− (diag(f f T ))T diag(DDT )DT D

(43)

Equations (40)–(43) are closed-form solutions for a and g.
Substituting a and g in (35) with (42) and (43), the minimum
SF standard deviation for the CIF model is found.

After solving for a and g, we can use the previous deﬁnition
a = n(1 − b) and g = nb
to calculate n, b, and f0. However,
f0
there are two equations but three unknowns, hence there is no
unique solution in general using three parameters. However, a
unique closed-form solution is available when f0 is speciﬁed as
a constant deemed appropriate by the user, such as the weighted
average of all frequencies used in the model, or at a natural loss
transition band (e.g., where measurements show an inﬂection
point in the PLE), or at known transition points like the 60 GHz
oxygen absorption band. Consequently, n and b are solved by:

n = a + gf0

b =

gf0

a + gf0
