On the physical realizability of quantum stochastic walks

Quantum walks are a promising framework that can be used to both understand and implement
quantum information processing tasks. The quantum stochastic walk is a recently developed frame-
work that combines the concept of a quantum walk with that of a classical random walk, through
open system evolution of a quantum system. Quantum stochastic walks have been shown to have ap-
plications in as far reaching ﬁelds as artiﬁcial intelligence. However, there are signiﬁcant constraints
on the kind of open system evolutions that can be realized in a physical experiment. In this work,
we discuss the restrictions on the allowed open system evolution, and the physical assumptions un-
derpinning them. We show that general implementations would require the complete solution of the
underlying unitary dynamics, and sophisticated reservoir engineering, thus weakening the beneﬁts
of experimental investigations.

With the ever increasing experimental control over sin-
gle and complex quantum systems [1–4], harvesting the
power of quantum physics for new technologies is no
longer a far-fetched idea. For a clear example of the
quantum world entering day-to-day life, one need look
no further than quantum cryptography [5]. Quantum
walks [6] are one of the most prominent frameworks in
which to design and think about quantum algorithms.
Both the continuous- [7] and discrete-time [8, 9] versions
have been shown to provide speed-up over classical infor-
mation processing tasks [10], and are universal for quan-
tum computing [11, 12]. Classical (probabilistic) and
quantum unitary random walks yield diﬀerent distribu-
tions due to interference eﬀects between diﬀerent paths
the walker can take on the associated graph network.
Combining the two, a stochastic, continuous-time quan-
tum walk (QSW) can be deﬁned in an axiomatic manner
to include unitary and non-unitary eﬀects, and include
both classical and quantum walks as limiting cases [13].
While a general purpose quantum computer is still far
over the horizon, intermediary technologies have been
emerging with the promise to breach classical limitations.
Within these, implementations of quantum neural net-
works, eﬃcient quantum transport, and boson sampling
have appeared as some of the platforms displaying the
power of quantum walks. In many cases, such as exci-
tation transfer in photosynthetic complexes, or in neural
networks, one of the key questions is the role of coher-
ence in the process eﬃciency. Therefore, their description
in a QSW formalism is natural [14, 15]. More recently,
novel exciting applications have been proposed in arti-
ﬁcial intelligence [16–18], which, at its core, involves an
autonomous agent that can learn from environmental in-
put and react to it, changing its behavior as more input
is received. A recent proposal uses quantum stochastic
walks to speed-up the learning of the agent [17].

As a standard quantum walk arises from unitary evo-
lution, which is a special case of reversible evolution, the
associated graphs are undirected. However, the stochas-
tic processes present in QSWs can give some direction-
ality to the graph network, at the price of introducing

decoherence. Directionality, in turn, can enhance trans-
port [19], or speed-up memory access in artiﬁcial intel-
ligence [17]. In order to preserve quantum speedup, the
nature of decoherence, i.e. its selectivity and rate, need
to be carefully designed.

In this work we investigate the implementation of
QSWs with no active control of the environment or ancil-
lary systems. We describe the limitations to physical im-
plementations of such a QSW, and show that only a very
restricted set of graphs can be implemented with quan-
tum systems under the canonical nondegenerate weak-
coupling assumptions. Our results suggest that a large
class of master equations often found in literature cannot
be engineered in real systems without either active envi-
ronmental control, or solving the full system dynamics
prior to its implementation.

The classical random walk is an important and well
studied model in statistical physics [20] describing the
probabilistic movement of a walker along a graph. Sys-
tem evolution in a classical random walk is described by
the transition probabilities from one node of the graph to
all other nodes connected to it. In a quantum walk the
evolution is instead described by transition probability
amplitudes, that is, by unitary evolution of the quantum
state describing the walker. Therefore, the main diﬀer-
ence between classical and quantum walks is coherence.
The generalization encompassing both concepts is the
so called quantum stochastic walk [13]. Each quantum
stochastic walk is deﬁned by its Lindblad master equa-
tion, which can be generally written as

ˆLk, ρ(cid:9)(cid:19)

where ρ denotes the density operator of the walker, ˆLk
are the Lindblad operators and γk the associated rates
(transition probabilities) responsible for the incoherent
part of the time evolution, and ˆH is the Hamiltonian
describing the coherent part of the time evolution. The
structure of the graph is encoded by the associated ma-
trices - nonzero elements of ˆH encode coherent edges and

those of the Lindblad operators encode incoherent edges.
Equation (1) incorporates both the classical random walk
and the quantum walk as special cases, and also allows
for the study of more general walks that exhibit both
coherent quantum and random classical behavior.

The quantum stochastic walk has been used to develop
new quantum algorithms, such as the machine learning
algorithms of Refs. [17, 18], and to model transport phe-
nomena in photosynthetic complexes [19] and quantum
neural networks [14]. In these, the incoherent evolution
conserves the excitation number of the graph, so that
evolution remains in the single excitation subspace when
a single walker is present, and the walker cannot be lost.
If we consider the situation where each node of the graph
is represented by a qubit, then the Lindblad operator de-
scribing incoherent excitation exchange from node n to
node m of the graph is given by ˆLk = σ−
m. The full
Lindblad equation is therefore given by

and it is the physical implementation of this walk that
will be the focus of this work. Note that for a general,
potentially directed walk, we must allow γnm (cid:54)= γmn.

The physical implementation of the quantum stochas-
tic walk of eq.(2) is challenging, as incoherent excita-
tion exchange between the nodes is required, while at
the same time the excitation must be protected from de-
caying into the environment.
In the following we will
show explicitly that the incoherent evolution of eq.(2)
cannot be built without active control of the system and
environment, or the solution of the complete unitary dy-
namics. While it is well known that master equations
built from phenomenological models can lead to unphys-
ical results [21, 22], our work, on the other hand, focuses
on whether a microscopic implementation can be created
to mimic the desired dynamics.

It is important to note that in this work we consider the
quantum stochastic walk as deﬁned in Ref. [13], and not
the open quantum walk of Refs. [23, 24], which, despite
the similar nomenclature, is an entirely diﬀerent frame-
work of open system evolution involving both internal
and positional degrees of freedom of the walker. The
QSW investigated here follows the paradigm of Ref. [7],
where the continuous time evolution takes place exclu-
sively on the position space of the walker, with no inter-
nal (coin) space needed.

Building a QSW from Standard Decoherence Models.
We consider the standard microscopic derivation of a
Lindblad form master equation in the weak coupling limit
[25] using the secular approximation. While in principle
the Lindblad equation can also be derived in the singu-
lar coupling limit [25], this situation only plays a minor
role in quantum computing platforms as it requires either

2

strong damping or high bath temperature for the Markov
approximation to be valid. Even though in the case of a
QSW this would only apply to some degrees of freedom,
it is more than challenging to engineer a quantum system
where some degrees of freedom are coherent and others
are strongly damped in a controlled way.

We assume from here on a system with nondegenerate
transition frequencies. We begin with a Hamiltonian of
the form

ˆH = ˆHS + ˆHB + ˆHSB,

(3)

where ˆHS is the self-Hamiltonian of the system, which
in our case describes the graph, and ˆHB is the self-
Hamiltonian of the environmental bath. The term ˆHSB
describes the system-bath interaction, and without loss
of generality has the form

ˆHSB =

k ⊗ ˆBk,
ˆS(j)

(4)

(cid:88)

nodes j with a coupling strength given by (cid:101)η(j)

where ˆS(j)
and ˆBk are system and bath operators re-
k
spectively, and each bath k can interact with many local
k . Start-
ing from these, our goal is to obtain a Lindblad master
equation of the form of eq.(2).
In the following, Latin
letters are used for the system local basis states {|m(cid:105)},
and Greek letters for the system eigenbasis, {|α(cid:105)}. In the
local basis, the master equation takes the form [26]

where Hs,mm(cid:48) ≡ (cid:104)m| ˆHs |m(cid:48)(cid:105) describes coherent dynam-
ics and Rmn,m(cid:48)n(cid:48) the incoherent transition rates in the
local basis.

Within the secular approximation,

fast oscillating
terms are neglected and the transition rates between di-
agonal elements, i.e., Rmm,nn ≡ Γmn, can be written as

Tmn;αα(cid:48)Γαα(cid:48) −(cid:88)

(cid:101)Tmn;αβ(cid:101)Γαβ.

Γmn =

(6)

αβ

Here Γαα(cid:48) represents the transition rate between eigen-

states, (cid:101)Γαβ their total dephasing rate, and we have de-
ﬁned (cid:101)Tmn;αβ ≡ (cid:104)m| α(cid:105)(cid:104)β| m(cid:105)(cid:104)α| n(cid:105)(cid:104)n| β(cid:105) and Tmn;αα(cid:48) ≡

|(cid:104)m| α(cid:105)|2 |(cid:104)α(cid:48)| n(cid:105)|2. All other contributions are sup-
pressed under the secular approximation, as we have as-
sumed all transition frequencies are nondegenerate.

As discussed before, eq.(2) does not allow for incoher-
ent annihilation of local excitations and so we require
that Γmn = 0 whenever |m(cid:105) and |n(cid:105) contain a diﬀerent

number of excitations. However, as Γαα(cid:48),(cid:101)Γαβ, Tmn;αα(cid:48) ≥

0 the ﬁrst sum in eq.(6) will be non-negative. Vanishing
transition rates then mean that either both sums vanish,
or the second one is negative and the sums cancel each
other.

Eigenstate transition rates. To determine the condi-
tions required to set Γmn = 0 we start by looking at the
second sum in eq.(6). Non-zero terms in the sum would
require pairs of eigenstates {|α(cid:105) ,|β(cid:105)} with non-zero over-

lap with both |m(cid:105) and |n(cid:105), otherwise (cid:101)Tmn;αβ = 0.

Thus, avoiding transitions between local states with dif-
ferent excitation numbers, by cancelling the two sums of
eq.(6), would demand eigenstates of the system Hamilto-
nian spanning states with diﬀerent numbers of walkers.
However, applications of quantum walks usually rely on
number-conserving graphs, at least at the Hamiltonian

level. As such, (cid:101)Tmn;αβ = 0 for all |m(cid:105) and |n(cid:105) with a

diﬀerent number of excitations, and the second sum in
eq.(6) vanishes. Therefore, the ﬁrst sum in eq.(6) must
also vanish so that Γmn = 0.

This
as
(cid:104)α| V (ω, ω(cid:48))|α(cid:48)(cid:105) = 0, which implies Γαα(cid:48) = 0 for all
eigenstates |α(cid:105) ,
|α(cid:48)(cid:105). Therefore, if we require that the
ﬁrst sum in eq.(6) vanish for all transitions |1(cid:105)n ↔ |0(cid:105),
it must vanish for all transitions, regardless of the nodes
and number of excitations involved.

As the second sum in eq.(6) vanishes for standard QWs,
and as we have just shown, so too must the ﬁrst, we
argue that local-decay cannot be used to generate any
relevant dynamics of the form of eq.(2). We note that it
is clear that the calculations shown above can be directly
generalized to ˆS(j)

(17)

The ﬁrst sum in eq.(6) vanishes only if Γαα(cid:48) = 0 for
all {α, α(cid:48)} with cα, c(cid:48)
(cid:54)= 0. From eq.(7) we see that
α(cid:48)
Γαα(cid:48) = 0 only if Vαω,α(cid:48)ω(cid:48) vanishes for all bath states for
which the Dirac Delta is non-zero. Let us assume that
the bath spectrum is dense, as is already implied by the
Markov approximation being applicable, such that the
energy conservation condition α − α(cid:48) + Eω − Eω(cid:48) =
0 can always be fulﬁlled. This means that, to prevent
transitions |m(cid:105) ↔ |n(cid:105) we require that for all {α, α(cid:48)} with

k,j

is trivially fulﬁlled if |m(cid:105) and |n(cid:105) have diﬀerent local exci-
tation numbers. By the same token, in the 1-walker sub-
space, this is also fulﬁlled by any two states |1(cid:105)m and |1(cid:105)n,
with m (cid:54)= n. However, this does not imply Γmn = 0, as
mentioned before. If, for example, two eigenstates spam
both |1(cid:105)m and |1(cid:105)n, then it is possible to have Γmn (cid:54)= 0.
The next point is to see if we can cancel local pure-
dephasing, while maintaining Γmn (cid:54)= 0 between single

(cid:101)Γmn ≡ Rmn,mn =

(cid:88)

α(cid:54)=α(cid:48)

excitation states of the nodes. Local pure-dephasing is
described by the rate

(cid:101)Tmn;αα(cid:48)Γαα(cid:48) −(cid:88)

Tmn;αβ(cid:101)Γαβ,

αβ

(18)

this vanish.

and we desire that
As we require
that Γmn (cid:54)= 0, there must be eigenstates for which

(cid:101)Tmn;αα(cid:48), Γαα(cid:48), Tmn;αβ, (cid:101)Γαβ (cid:54)= 0. Therefore, in general,
we need to cancel the two sums to obtain(cid:101)Γmn = 0, which

requires an environment tailored to the graph. While en-
gineering an environment that is locally compatible with
the graph Hamiltonian is in principle doable, adapting
the environment to the global eigenstates of the graph
is equivalent to ﬁrst solving the problem the quantum
computer is supposed to solve.

What we have found is that if the Hamiltonian of the
graph preservers excitation number, then local dephasing
can be used to obtain Γmn (cid:54)= 0 only for transitions that
conserve excitation number, as desired. However, to do
so we must ﬁrst calculate the eigensystem of HS, then
solve a set of coupled equations that give the appropri-
ate system-bath couplings for zero local pure-dephasing.
This is eﬀectively reservoir engineering, and can be a con-
siderable undertaking when the graph is of suﬃcient size.
However, it must be noted that as both dephasing and
HS preserve excitation number, only one block of the
Hamiltonian must be diagonalized. This is not true for
local decay, which does not conserve excitation number.
Depolarizing channel. A common decoherence model
is the depolarizing channel, described by a coupling of
and σ(j)
the reservoir to all qubit operators, σ(j)
z .
The calculations above can be easily generalized to show
that such coupling to the bath leads to all the restrictions
found for both decay and dephasing. As expected, this
model cannot lead to the desired master equation.

x , σ(j)
y

In both the decay and dephasing cases, it is in principle
possible to solve the full set of equations, eq.(6), and
ﬁnd parameters for which all the unwanted transitions
vanish. However, this would involve full diagonalisation
of both ˆHS and ˆHB, and possibly (deﬁnitely in the case
of local decay) require very intricate bath engineering.
In addition, such techniques would intricately link the
coherent and incoherent transition rates.

One possibility would be to design reservoirs such that
for certain pairs of states, the energy conservation con-
dition of eq.(7) cannot be fulﬁlled, and thus, eq.(14)
would not be valid. In doing so, one would cancel un-
wanted transitions by a careful designed reservoir spec-
trum. While such strategies for reservoir engineering can
be useful [27–31], for the applications usually envisioned
for quantum walks their use would rely on the laborious
solution of the complete unitary problem.

We note that other types of Lindblad equations can be
conceived, where local excitation decay plays an impor-

4

tant role, e.g., in an energy transfer process [15]. How-
ever, as these models do not usually include incoherent
creation of excitations, implementations of such dynam-
ics would be plagued by the same issues discussed here.
As a consequence of the secular approximation the rates
Γmn and Γnm cannot be independently set, so preventing
one such transition while allowing the other would pose
the same requirements as for eq.(2).

Conclusions. Master equations in Lindblad form de-
scribe the most general quantum state evolution that is
guaranteed to be completely positive and trace preserv-
ing. However, the set of Lindblad operators allowed for
a given physical system is limited by the physical inter-
actions naturally occurring.
In other words, often the
mathematical formulation of a dynamical system cannot
be realizable in real world applications. We have stud-
ied such limitations for an arbitrary, number-conserving,
stochastic master equation, under the usual secular and
Markov approximations. We have discussed the problems
of creating such an evolution using ubiquitous decoher-
ence models, such as pure dephasing, amplitude damp-
ing, and depolarizing channels.

Our results show that microscopic implementation of
general open system evolution can only be realized if the
full unitary dynamics have been solved, and control of
the reservoir is available. For interesting cases, actual ex-
perimental implementations of quantum stochastic walks
are intended to tackle classically hard problems, which
makes solving the full unitary dynamics of the system
infeasible. Moreover, as all two-body system-bath inter-
actions can be described by the interaction Hamiltonians
studied above, carefully designed interactions can only
circumvent the restrictions found by properly engineered
local reservoir spectra, or for systems for which the secu-
lar approximation does not apply. In the latter case, this
could be done by suitable use of degenerate transitions;
however, engineering these would again require complete
knowledge of the unitary dynamics.
