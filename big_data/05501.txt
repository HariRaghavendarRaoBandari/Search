Abstract

We consider the leading and subleading UV divergences for the four-point on-
shell scattering amplitudes in D=8 N=1 sypersymmetric Yang-Mills theory within
the spinor-helicity and superﬁeld formalism. This theory belongs to the class of
maximally supersymmetric gauge theories and presumably possesses distinguished
properties beyond perturbation theory. We obtain the recursive relations that allow
one to get the leading and subleading divergences in all loops in a pure algebraic way
staring from the one loop (for the leading poles) and two loop (for the subleading
ones) diagrams. As a particular example where the recursive relations have a simple
form we consider the ladder type diagrams. The all loop summation of the leading
and subleading divergences is performed with the help of the diﬀerential equations
which are the generalization of the RG equations for non-renormalizable theories.
They have explicit solutions for the ladder type diagrams. We discuss the properties
of the obtained solutions and interpretation of the results.

Introduction

In the last decade there has been considerable activity on the calculation of the amplitudes
in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories (SYM) [1, 2] and maximally supersym-
metric gravity [3]. Gauge and gravity SUSY theories in D = 4 such as the N = 4 SYM

1

and N = 8 SUGRA are the most important examples. These theories are believed to
possess several remarkable properties, among which are total or partial cancelation of UV
divergences, factorization of higher loop corrections and possible integrability. The success
of factorization leading to the BDS ansatz [1] for the amplitudes in D = 4 N = 4 SYM
stimulated similar activity in other models and dimensions. Many magniﬁcent insights
in the structure of amplitudes (the S-matrix) of gauge theories in various dimensions (for
review see, for example, [4]) were obtained.

In recent papers [5, 6] we considered the leading UV divergences of the on-shell scat-
tering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric SYM theories in D=6 (N=2 SUSY), D=8
(N=1 SUSY) and D=10 (N=1 SUSY) dimensions. In these theories the on-shell ampli-
tudes are IR ﬁnite and the only divergences are the UV ones. Since the gauge coupling
g2 in D-dimensions has dimension [4 − D], all these theories are non-renormalizable.

Applying ﬁrst the color decomposition of the amplitudes we are left with the partial
amplitudes. Within the spinor-helicity formalism the tree level partial amplitudes have a
relatively simple universal form and always factorize so that the ratio of the loop correc-
tions to the tree level expression can be expressed in terms of scalar master integrals. For
the four-point amplitude this is shown schematically in Fig.1.

The on-shell four-point amplitude depends on the Mandelstam variables s,t and u with
the condition s+t+u=0. Within the dimensional regularization (dimensional reduction)
the UV divergences manifest themselves as the pole terms with the numerators being the
polynomials over the kinematical variables. This expansion has a universal form in any

powers of s and t. The dependence on particular value of D comes from the integration
inside the loops.

In D-dimensions the ﬁrst UV divergences start from L=6/(D-4) loops. Consequently
in D=6 they start from 3 loops and for D=8 and 10 they start already at one loop. In [6]
we considered the leading divergences in all of these cases. Here, to reduce the number
of loops we concentrate on the D=8 case. Contrary to [6], here we go beyond the leading
divergences and consider the subleading ones in order to understand the tendency and to
check whether the subleading terms change the situation regarding the renormalization
of the theory in all loops.

2 R(cid:48)-operation and pole equations in the leading and

subleading order

Any local quantum ﬁeld theory has a remarkable property that after performing the
incomplete R-operation, the so-called R(cid:48)-operation, the remaining UV divergences are
always local. Let us brieﬂy recall the main notions of the R-operation [7, 8]. Being applied
to any Green function Γ (or any particular graph G) it subtracts all the UV divergences
including those of divergent subgraphs and leaves the ﬁnite expression. The use of the
R-operation is equivalent to addition of the counter terms to the initial Lagrangian. The
R operation can be written in terms of subtraction operators in the factorized form

RG =

(1 − Mγ)G,

(1)

(cid:89)

γ

where the subtraction operator Mγ subtracts the UV divergence of a given subgraph γ
and the product goes over all divergent subgraphs including the graph itself.
It is useful to deﬁne also the incomplete R operation denoted by R(cid:48) which subtracts
only the subdivergences of the graph G. The full R operation is then deﬁned as

RG = (1 − K)R(cid:48)G,

(2)

where K is an operator that singles out the singular part of the graph (for the minimal
subtraction scheme the operator K singles out the 1/n terms). The KR(cid:48)G is the counter
term corresponding to the graph G. Each counter term contains only the superﬁcial
divergence and is local in coordinate space (in our case it must be a polynomial of external
momenta).
The R(cid:48) operation for any graph G can be deﬁned by the forest formula, but for our
calculations it is more convenient to use the recursive deﬁnition via the R(cid:48) operation for
divergent subgraphs (for details and examples see chapter 3 in [9]):

The sum goes over all 1PI, UV-divergent subgraphs of the given diagram and the multiple
sums include only the non-intersecting subgraphs.
When applying this formula to the diagrams at hand one ﬁnds out that for the n-
loop diagram the R(cid:48)-operation results in the series of terms (we consider the leading and
subleading poles)

where the terms like

after subtraction of the (n − k)-loop counterterm. The full expression (4) has to be local,
i.e. should not contain terms like (log µ)k/m for all k, m > 0 while being expanded over
. (For simplicity hereafter we put µ2 ≡ µ.) This requirement gives us n− 1 equations for
the coeﬃcients A(n)

of the one and two loop graphs one gets

This means that performing the R(cid:48)-operation one can take care only of the one loop dia-
grams surviving after contraction and get the desired leading pole term via eq.(5) and add
the two loop diagrams to get the subleading pole from eq.(6). This observation drastically
simpliﬁes the calculation of the leading and subleading poles. Moreover, it follows from
eqs.(5,6) that, just as in renormalizable theories, the leading poles are essentially governed
by the one loop diagrams and can be deduced from them in all loops pure algebraically,
while to know the subleading poles in all loops one needs to know the subleading pole of
the two loop diagrams. We demonstrate below how this procedure works in practice and
obtain explicit formulas for the leading and subleading poles in all loops.

3 The leading poles in all loops
We start with the leading poles and consider as a simplest example the R(cid:48)-operation
applied to the ladder type diagrams (see Fig.2). To calculate the contribution to A(n)

one needs the constant part of these one loop graphs and for B(n)

Note that taking into account the combinatoric factors the dimensionless variable z is
given by z = g2s2
. This series reproduces the ladder type diagrams in all orders. The


same is obviously true for the t-channel ladder diagram with the replacement s ↔ t. The
function ΣA given by eq.(14) has an inﬁnite sequence of simple poles and thus has no
limit when z → ∞ i.e.,  → 0.

The recursion relation (10) can be generalized to include all diagrams contributing to
the four point amplitude. It was obtained in [6] and we present here a short summary.
Note ﬁrst of all that all diagrams can be divided into two classes: the s-channel and the
t-channel ones and the total contribution is the sum of them. The singularity of Gn is
a polynomial in s and t. When calculating A(n)
like in Fig.2 for the s-channel diagrams,
s stands as a constant factor while t from KR(cid:48)Gn−1 contains the integration momentum
over the last loop. The same is true for the t-channel diagrams with the replacement
s ↔ t.
As a result, when using the R(cid:48)-operation one is left with the remaining triangle and
bubble one loop diagrams shown in the ﬁrst and the third raws of Fig.2. Substituting
the explicit form of s and t and integrating over the triangle and the bubble with the
help of the Feynman parameters one gets the desired recursion relation. Note that for the
bubble term when integrating over the loop on both sides one has functions of s and t.
Replacing t by t(cid:48) one should have in mind that on the left t(cid:48) = (l − p1)2 and on the right
t(cid:48) = (l + p2
4), where l is the integration momentum. This means that while integration
one gets the mixed terms like gµνpµ
4. They give rise to the double sum in the second
term of the equation. Eventually one has

where t(cid:48) = tx + uy, u = −t − s, and S1 = 1
12. Here we denote by Sn(s, t)
and Tn(s, t) the sum of all contributions in the n-th order of PT in s and t channels,
respectively.
The same recursive relation is valid for the t-channel diagrams with the obvious
replacement s ↔ t. Due to the s − t symmetry of the amplitude, one should have
Tn(s, t) = Sn(t, s). The coeﬃcient A(n)

n (s, t) of the n’th order pole is the sum

12, T1 = 1

A(n)
n (s, t) = Sn(s, t) + Tn(s, t).

Equation (16) can be summed the same way as in the ladder case (11). Multiplying

both sides by (−z)n−1 and summing up over n from 3 to inﬁnity one gets

The same equation with the replacement s ↔ t can be derived for Σ(t, s, z).

We now turn to the subleading pole. As an example we again consider the ladder diagrams.
Contrary to the leading case, here the input is deﬁned not only by the one loop diagrams,
but by the two-loop ones as well. The subleading pole of the two loop box has to be
explicitly evaluated, it cannot be deduced from the recursion relations as it follows from
eq. (6). Explicit evaluation gives

Together with the other one and two loop diagrams evaluated up to the subleading order
we obtain the expressions for B(n)

The last step is to sum the series. In order to do it we again write down the diﬀerential
equation for the sum. Let us begin with B(cid:48)
sn. Multiplying eq.(22) by zn−2 and taking the
sum from 3 to inﬁnity we get the diﬀerential equation for Σ(cid:48)

5 Properties of the Solutions

5.1 Analytical analysis

We discuss here some properties of solutions of eqs.(29,30). The eq.(29) is a linear inho-
mogeneous diﬀerential equation and according to a general rule to solve it one has ﬁrst
to solve the homogeneous equation

Y (cid:48)(cid:48)(z) + Y (z)(cid:48)f1(z) + Y (z)f2(z) = 0,

(31)

and then using the r.h.s. get the solution of the inhomogeneous one. The homogeneous
eq.(31) can be simpliﬁed making the substitution: Y (z) = dΣA
dz u(z). Then it is reduced to

u(cid:48)(cid:48)(z) +

ΣA(z)
180

u(z) = 0,

(32)

which is already solvable in terms of the Hypergeometric functions. Due to periodicity
of ΣA (13) it is convenient to rewrite eq.(32) in terms of ΣA. Making the substitution
u(z) = 1√
Σ(cid:48)

A

v(ΣA) we arrive at equation for v(x)
3 − 16x

v(cid:48)(cid:48)(x) − 5
4

(10 − 5x + x2)2 v(x) = 0,

(33)

12

which is a bit simpler but still is not solvable in convenient form. The solution of this
equation is expressed in terms of Hypergeometric functions of a complex argument and
further analysis of the inhomogeneous equation becomes diﬃcult. Therefore, we opt for
the numerical analysis.

5.2 Numerical analysis

Consider ﬁrst the leading divergences given by ΣA (14). It is a singular periodic func-

15 = arcsin(cid:112)3/8 +

Despite the complexity of the analytic solution the numerical analysis happens to be
straightforward. It reveals the main features of the function of interest and conﬁrms the
applicability of perturbation theory in the region between singularities.
√
15 = πn and ﬁrst order poles at z/8/

√
tion which has zeroes at z/8/
πn. Summation of perturbative expansion (15) gives a satisfactory approximation between
zero and the ﬁrst pole at z ≈ 20.42, however fails to go beyond as can be seen in Fig.3
(left) below.

Figure 3: Comparison of the exact solution with the perturbation series including 20
terms for ΣA (left) and for ΣsB (right). The solid line is the exact (numerical) solution
and the dotted line is the PT series summation result

Turning to subleading divergences given by ΣsB we perform a numerical solution of
eq.(29) and then substitute it into eq.(30) taking into account eq.(26). Since the coef-
ﬁcients of eq.(29) contain the singular function ΣA one should expect that the solution
is also singular and possesses poles at the same points. Thus, the numerical solution is
due to be valid in the interval between zero and the ﬁrst pole. In the same interval one
can also perform a summation of perturbation series generated with the help of the code
written above. We present in Fig.3 (right) the result of numerical solution of eqs. (29,30)
together with the perturbation theory series taking into account 20 terms of expansion.
There are two main conclusions that one can make analyzing these plots. First of
all, that the PT works pretty well in the interval between zero and the ﬁrst pole and
the more terms are taken into account the better. In the case when we know the exact

13

Series:20termsExactsolution51015202530z-150-100-5050100ΣaSeries:20termsNumericalsolution5101520z50100150200Σssolution as for ΣA we can convince ourselves that the series is indeed convergent. In the
case of ΣsB we check it numerically plotting the ratio of the coeﬃcients bs[n + 1]/bs[n]
(see Fig.4). One can see that after some ﬁrst orders it goes to the limit equal to ≈ 0.05

Figure 4: The ratio of the coeﬃcients bs[n]: R = bs[n + 1]/bs[n]

which indicates the geometric progression type behaviour. Thus, the perturbation series
seems to be convergent independently of the sign alternation. The second conclusion
concerns the singularity of the obtained functions. The total contribution of the leading
and subleading divergences for the ladder type diagrams in all orders can be written as

ΣLadder = ΣA(z) + (ΣsB(z) +

t
s

ΣtB(z)) + . . . ,

z ≡ g2s2


.

(34)

From the analytical solution for ΣA(z) (14) and ΣtB (28) we see that while ΣA has an
inﬁnite sequence of poles, ΣtB exponentially grows although slower than ΣA. At the
same time, from the numerical solution for ΣsB it follows that it apparently inherits the
singularities of ΣA and does not cancel them. Thus, one can conclude that the subleading
divergences do not change the pattern of the leading ones.

6 Discussion

Summarizing the presented results concerning the subleading divergences one should stress
once more that the all loop terms are governed by the two loop subleading contributions as
it follows from the general theorems. We have presented explicit formulas conﬁrming this
statement and have demonstrated how the higher terms can be calculated from the lower

14

101520253035N-0.3-0.2-0.1relativeones via pure algebraic recursive relations. The corresponding equations generalize the
usual renormalization group relations for the pole terms for the case of non-renormalizable
interactions.

To make everything explicit and transparent we chose the set of the ladder type
diagrams and performed the summation of the leading and subleading divergences in
all loops. Even this task happened to be quite complicated and we were bound to use
numerical methods. However, the result of summation of subleading divergences does not
lead to any qualitative diﬀerence from the leading terms. All the main features of the
leading divergences keep untouched.

As for the total set of diagrams, already the leading divergences described by eq.(18)
are diﬃcult to analyze. Following the same lines one can construct an analogous equation
for the subleading divergences but it will be even more complicated. The key question
here is whether the account of all diagrams will improve the behaviour of the laddrer
type diagrams and remove the inﬁnite sequence of poles or not. More general question
is to make sense of non-renormalizable interactions and to interpret the obtained results.
Does the limit when  → 0 exists or not? Has the inﬁnite sequence of poles, if it survives,
anything to do with the inﬁnite number of bound states like in a string theory[[11] or not?
We leave the analysis of these questions to further publications.
