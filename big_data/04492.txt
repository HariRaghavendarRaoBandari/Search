Abstract. We provide new general methods in the calculus of variations for the anisotropic
Plateau problem in arbitrary dimension and codimension. A new direct proof of Almgren’s 1968
existence result is presented; namely, we produce from a class of competing “surfaces,” which span
a given bounding set in some ambient space, one with minimal anisotropically weighted area. In
particular, rectiﬁability of a candidate minimizer is proved without the assumption of quasimini-
mality. Our ambient spaces are a class of Lipschitz neighborhood retracts which includes manifolds
with boundary and manifolds with certain singularities. Our competing surfaces are rectiﬁable sets
which satisfy any combination of general homological, cohomological or homotopical spanning con-
ditions. An axiomatic spanning criterion is also provided. Our boundaries are permitted to be
arbitrary closed subsets of the ambient space, providing a good setting for surfaces with sliding
boundaries.

1. Introduction

Plateau’s problem asks if there exists a surface of least area amongst all surfaces whose boundary
is a given closed curve in R3. Douglas [Dou31] found solutions assuming the surfaces are immersed
parametrized disks. Three seminal papers appearing in 1960 [Rei60] [FF60] [dG60] generalized
Douglas’s result in a number of ways, and the techniques developed gave birth to the modern ﬁeld of
geometric measure theory. The Plateau problem itself is a special case of an anisotropic minimization
problem, ﬁrst articulated by Almgren in his celebrated 1968 paper [Alm68] which built upon methods
in [Rei60] and [FF60].

In this paper we present what we believe to be the ﬁrst complete proof to the main result in [Alm68],
establishing existence of solutions to the elliptic minimization problem for m-dimensional surfaces
in an ambient n-dimensional space. Roughly speaking, given some compact bounding set A and a
collection of m-rectiﬁable sets X Ą A which “span” A in some topological sense, we prove there
exists a set X0 with minimum m-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure, weighted by a density functional
which may depend non-trivially on tangent directions. Such anisotropic density functionals are
assumed to be “elliptic” in the sense that an m-disk centered at any given point can be made small
enough so that it very nearly minimizes the weighted area.

If there is control over the Hausdorﬀ measures of deformations of the elements of a minimizing
sequence tXkukPN, and this control is uniform across all scales and all k, then the job of analyzing

the limit set X0 becomes markedly easier. This condition called “pM, 0, δq-minimizing” in [Alm76]
and “uniformly quasiminimal” in [DS00]. Such sequences have nice properties; in particular, their
limit sets are m-rectiﬁable with good bounds on density ratios. However, there is as of yet no known
method to convert an arbitrary minimizing sequence tXku into a quasiminimal one1. There is a
serious gap in [Alm68] where it is assumed that a minimizing sequence for the elliptic integrand is
uniformly quasiminimal2. In his last major paper on the anisotropic Plateau’s problem [Alm76],
Almgren assumed that his competitors were already quasiminimal, thus ﬁlling the gap, but in so
doing gave up a more general existence theorem [Mor88]. His solution depends on the quasiminimal
constant, and compactness fails if this constant is permitted to vary. In his review article [Alm93] he
took appropriate credit for his important deﬁnition of elliptic integrands and his proof of regularity
for minimizing solutions in [Alm68], but he did not claim to have proved an existence theorem.

Reifenberg regular sequences

A key method that avoids this problem was introduced by Reifenberg in [Rei60] and expanded
upon by the authors in [HP15]. Instead of quasiminimal sequences, we use what we call “Reifenberg
regular sequences.” These are sequences tXkukPN in which Xk has a uniform lower bound on density
ratios, down to a scale that decreases as k increases. Given a minimizing sequence, it is not too
hard to produce a Reifenberg regular subsequence. Limits of these sequences have nice properties
(see [HP15] §4.3,) most importantly the possession of a uniform lower density bound. The main
result of the current paper boils down to showing that two key constructions of Fleming (see Lemma
3.0.4 and [Fle66] 8.2,) and Almgren (see Theorem 4.0.11 and [Alm68] 3.2(c)) can be applied to
Reifenberg regular minimizing sequences instead of quasiminimal sequences.

Our methods are those of classical geometric measure theory, drawing tools from Besicovitch [Bes48,
Bes49a, Bes49b], Reifenberg [Rei60], Federer and Fleming [FF60], [Fle66], and our previous work
[HP15] [HP13]. We do not use quasiminimal sets, varifolds or currents at any stage in our proof,
nor do we reference any results which require their use. Our proof of rectiﬁability is not based on
density and Preiss’s theorem, as was our isotropic result [HP15], but rather Federer-Fleming and
Besicovitch-Federer projections.

We now discuss several advances that our approach aﬀords over Almgren’s original statement.

Bounding sets

Both isotropic and anisotropic Plateau problems come with a prescribed bounding set A. This is a
set which all competitors are assumed to contain. The role that A plays in Plateau problems mimics
that of a boundary condition in PDE’s, but we call A a “bounding set” since it might look nothing
like the boundary of an m-dimensional set in some simple examples (see Figure 1.) Bounding sets
A in [Alm68] are assumed to satisfy Hm´1pAq ă 8. Instead, we permit A to be any compact set,

1Some progress has been made by David [Dav07] and his student V. Feuvrier. See also [Fan13].
2See the last paragraph of 2.9(b2) which is needed for Almgren’s main existence result. In this section he is working
with a compact rectiﬁable subset S and assumes it is quasiminimal immediately before the conclusion of 2.9(b2) which
is the isoperimetric inequality. The quasiminimal constant assumed here must be uniform across all scales and all S
as can be seen in the way he applies the isoperimetric inequality. Interested readers could start with 3.4 where he
introduces a minimizing sequence for the ﬁrst time. His proof of lower density bounds uses 2.9(b2), but all he has is
a minimizing sequence at this point and he cannot apply 2.9(b2). Indeed, it is not hard to come up with minimizing
sequences that are not uniformly quasiminimal.

including the empty set and sets with dimension n (we minimize the elliptic functional over the
sets XzA.) Our model permits “sliding boundaries” in a natural and ﬂexible setting. The frontier
of XzA, which can be informally thought of as the “boundary” of XzA is necessarily contained in
A, but is not further constrained. Sliding boundaries have been studied in continuum mechanics
for years, (see [PG00], for example.) and a deﬁnition suitable for geometric measure theory was
introduced in [Dav14], while [LGM15] and [PRG15] use a slightly diﬀerent one. We propose a
deﬁnition of sliding boundaries that suits the new methods we have developed and seems to model
natural processes of interest to physicists and engineers. An example is provided by Figure 2. Here,
the torus T 2 is our bounding set and one can, for example, ask that competitors span with respect
to one homology cycle or the other, corresponding the cycles drawn in the two respective tori. But
the frontier of any solution (minus A) is contained in T 2.

Figure 1. Sliding boundaries. In each of the three ﬁgures there are three com-
petitors, including a shaded one with minimal area. Figure (a) depicts the classical
Plateau problem where the bounding set is a prescribed curve. The bounding set of
both Figures (b) and (c) is a 2-torus and boundaries of competing surfaces are not
constrained, apart from being contained in the torus. This permits elliptic prob-
lems with “sliding boundaries” to be solved. In (a) we chose a spanning test using
linking numbers. In (b) and (c) we chose a spanning test relative to one of the two
generators of 1-dimensional homology.

Spanning conditions There have been a number of spanning conditions deﬁned over the years,
yielding distinct Plateau problems in the literature. These include the boundary of parametrized
disks of [Dou31], the algebraic boundary of integral currents [FF60], the ˇCech homology spanning
condition of Adams (see the appendix of [Rei60],) the ˇCech cohomological counterpart [HP15],
the linking number condition in [Har14] and [HP13], the related homotopy tests and ﬁnally the
axiomatic approaches in [LGM15] and [PRG15]. In the current paper, we work with ˇCech theoretic,
homotopical, and axiomatic spanning conditions.

Figure 2. This “squashed” solid torus C is the ambient space in which we may
set up an anisotropic minimization problem. Here the bounding set A is the union
of two circles in the interior of C and the light blue cylinder P Ă C depicts a
competitor spanning A.

Whenever one wishes to extend a particular result in geometric measure theory from Euclidean
space to an ambient Riemannian manifold, one is faced with the choice of either working in charts,
or embedding the manifold in Euclidean space and proving that the various constructions used can
be deformed back onto the manifold.
Indeed, this second approach is invariably much simpler,
and usually yields further generalization to spaces more general than manifolds, namely Lipschitz
neighborhood retracts. We have chosen this second approach. However, the full category of Lipschitz
neighborhood retracts seems slightly out of reach. We make use of one construction in particular,
namely Corollary 3.0.2, in which it is vital to assume slightly more about the ambient space, that the
Lipschitz retraction can be “localized” (Deﬁnition 2.0.1.) Nevertheless, this slightly restricted class
of Lipschitz neighborhood retracts contains all the interesting examples we can think of, including
Riemannian manifolds with boundary and certain manifolds with singularities.

Lastly, while completing this paper we learned that diﬀerent versions of some results of this paper
in codimension one have been obtained at the same time by De Lellis, De Rosa, and Ghiraldin
in [DLDRG16]. They use diﬀerent arguments and build upon their previous work [LGM15], [PRG15].

2. Definitions and Main Result

Deﬁnition 2.0.1. A set C Ă Rn is a Lipschitz neighborhood retract if there exists a neighbor-
hood U of C and a Lipschitz retraction π : U Ñ C. We say a Lipschitz neighborhood retract is
localizable if for every p P C there exist κp ă 8 and ξp ą 0 such that if 0 ă r ă ξp then there
exists a Lipschitz retraction πp,r : C Y Bpp, rq Ñ C with πp,rpBpp, rqq “ Cpp, rq and with Lipschitz
constant ď κp. We call ξp the retraction radius of C at p. If C is compact, the condition of being
localizable implies that C is a priori a Lipschitz neighborhood retract. Localizability also implies
local contractibility. If suptκp : p P Cu ă 8, then we say the localizable Lipschitz neighborhood
retract is uniform.

For example, smoothly embedded submanifolds of Rn are uniform localizable Lipschitz neighborhood
retracts.
Let C Ă Rn and let 1 ď m ď n. Let T mC denote the subbundle of the restriction to C of the
unoriented Grassmannian bundle Rnˆ Grpm, nq Ñ Rn consisting of pairs pp, Eq P C ˆ Grpm, nq such
that E is an approximate tangent space at p for some m-rectiﬁable subset of C. Let T m
p C denote
the ﬁber of T mC above p. Let 0 ă a ď b ă 8 and suppose f : T mC Ñ ra, bs is measurable. For an
Hm measurable m-rectiﬁable set X Ă C, deﬁne

Deﬁnition 2.0.2. If W Ă C, we say f is elliptic in W if there exists a neighborhood U of C and
a measurable extension ˜f : T mU Ñ ra1, b1s with 0 ă a1 ď b1 ă 8 such that the following condition
p C: If  ą 0, there exists 0 ă s ď dpp, U cq
is satisﬁed for Hm almost every p P W and every E P T m
such that if 0 ă r ă s, then

˜f pZq,

(a) Z X BBpp, rq “ E X BBpp, rq; and
(b) There is no retraction from Z onto E X BBpp, rq.

This deﬁnition of ellipticity may be unwieldy, but it captures Almgren’s elliptic functionals ( [Alm68]
1.2) and generalizes them to a broader class of domain. In particular, C may be a region in Rn with
manifold boundary, or a manifold with singularities (see Figure 2.) See §2.1 for more on the ellipticity
condition.
Deﬁnition 2.0.3. Let A Ă C, possibly empty. An algebraic spanning condition is a subset
L “ pL1, L2, L3, L4q of the union Hm´1pAq Y H m´1pAq Y HmpCq Y H mpCq. These are understood
to be reduced ˇCech (co)homology groups, and the coeﬃcients may vary between the four so long as
the homology groups have compact coeﬃcients. Let X Ă C with X Ą A and let i : A Ñ X and
j : X Ñ C denote the inclusions. We say X spans L if L1 Ă kerpi˚q, L2Ximpi˚q “ H, L3 Ă impj˚q,
and L4 X kerpj˚q “ H. Let SpA, C, L, mq denote the set of all compact sets X Ă C which span L,
such that HmpXzAq ă 8. Let SpA, C, LR, mq denote the subset of SpA, C, L, mq consisting of those
sets X such that XzA is m-rectiﬁable.

Theorem 2.0.4. Suppose pC, Aq is a compact pair and that C is a uniform3 localizable Lipschitz
neighborhood retract. Let 1 ă m ď n and suppose L is an algebraic spanning condition. If f :
T mC Ñ ra, bs is elliptic in CzA and if SpA, C, L, mq is non-empty, then SpA, C, LR, mq is non-
empty as well, and contains an element which minimizes the functional X ÞÑ FmpXzAq among
elements of SpA, C, LR, mq.

Theorem 2.0.4 generalizes to functionals other than X ÞÑ FmpXzAq, namely those which occur as
the evaluation X ÞÑ µXpRnq, where tµX : X P SpA, C, L, mqu (or tµX : X P SpA, C, LR, mqu) is
a collection of ﬁnite Borel measures on Rn, satisfying an analog of (1) and the following overlap
condition:
Deﬁnition 2.0.5 (Overlap Condition). If 0 ă a ď b ă 8 and for each Y P SpA, C, L, mq (resp.
SpA, C, LR, mq,) a ﬁnite Borel measure µY on Rn is given satisfying

and such that for every Borel set B Ă Rn, it holds that µY pBq “ µZpBq whenever pY zAq X B “
pZzAq X B, then we say such a collection of measures satisﬁes the overlap condition.

aHmtY zAď µY ď bHmtY zA

It is apparent4 that the measures µXpBq ” FmpB X XzAq satisfy the overlap condition. Even more
generally, the algebraic spanning condition L can be replaced with any condition K so long as the
resulting collection SpA, C, K, mq is closed under:

(a) The map X ÞÑ supppµXq Y A;
(b) The action of Lipschitz functions g : C Ñ C which ﬁx A and are homotopic to the identity

relative to A;

(c) The constructions of Corollary 3.0.2 (a cone using Federer/Fleming projections), and [Rei60]
Lemma 8 (an isoperimetric inequality) as used in Lemma 4.2.3 of [HP15] (existence of a
Reifenberg regular sequence that is convergent and minimizing);

(d) Either weak5 or Hausdorﬀ limits of minimizing sequences6.

In summary:
Theorem 2.0.6. Let pC, Aq be a compact pair, with C a uniform3 localizable Lipschitz neighborhood
retract. Suppose SpA, C, K, mq is a non-empty collection of closed sets X with A Ă X Ă C and
HmpXzAq ă 8. If tµX : X P SpA, C, K, mqu is a collection of ﬁnite Borel measures on C which
is elliptic in CzA (see Deﬁnition 2.1.1 below,) and which satisﬁes the overlap condition, and if
SpA, C, K, mq is closed under (a)-(d), then there exists X0 P SpA, C, K, mq such that µX0 is m-
rectiﬁable and µX0pCq is minimal among elements of tµXpCq : X P SpA, C, K, mqu.

Let IA denote set of diﬀeomorphisms of Rn which ﬁx A and are isotopic to the identity relative to A.
If the retractions π and πp,r are C 0 close to IA, and if tµX : X P SpA, C, K, mqu is strongly elliptic
(see Deﬁnition 2.1.1) in CzA, then (b) can be replaced with

(b)’ The action of Lipschitz functions g : C Ñ C which ﬁx A and are homotopic to the identity

relative to A, and are in the C 0 closure of IA.

If SpA, C, K, mq is closed under Hausdorﬀ limits, then it is not necessary to assume that (c) holds,
for it will hold automatically by [Pug16]. If SpA, C, K, mq consists of sets which are m-rectiﬁable
away from A, then (c) holds automatically if SpA, C, K, mq is closed under Hausdorﬀ limits which
are m-rectiﬁable away from A.
Likewise, if SpA, C, K, mq is closed under local Hausdorﬀ limits7, then it can be assumed that there
is some  ą 0 such that the functions g in (b)’ diﬀer from the identity only within balls of radius
. If SpA, C, K, mq consists of sets which are m-rectiﬁable away from A, then the same conclusion
holds if SpA, C, K, mq is closed under local Hausdorﬀ limits which are m-rectiﬁable away from A.

Finally, if C is a smooth manifold, the set IA in (b)’ can be replaced with the set JA of diﬀeomor-
phisms of C which ﬁx A and are isotopic to the identity relative to A.

Examples 2.0.7.

In the case that the conditions immediately preceding (b)’ hold, K may be the deﬁned to be the
homotopical “linking number” spanning condition deﬁned by the authors in [HP13]. More generally,
if S consists of a collection of compact smoothly embedded manifolds M Ă Ac (resp. M Ă CzA
if C is a smooth manifold) which is invariant under either IA (resp. JA,) then one may deﬁne
SpA, C, K, mq to be the set of all closed sets X with A Ă X Ă C and X X M ‰ H for all M P S.
One may pick some initial closed set X with A Ă X Ă C and HmpXzAq ă 8, and deﬁne
SpA, C, KX , mq to be the smallest collection of closed sets Y with A Ă Y Ă C and HmpY zAq ă 8,
which contains X, and which is closed under Hausdorﬀ limits, the map Y ÞÑ supppµYq Y A, and
the action of Lipschitz functions g : pC, Aq Ñ pC, Aq which are homotopic to the identity. This is a
version of what is known in the literature as sliding boundaries (see Figure 1.)

2.1. More on Ellipticity. Ellipticity of f : T mC Ñ ra, bs is implied in the following cases:
Suppose C is either Rn or an isometrically embedded C 2 Riemannian manifold. For p P C, let
fp : T mC Ñ ra, bs denote the function pq, Tq ÞÑ fpp, ˜Tq, where in the manifold case it is understood
that

(a) The function fp is only partially deﬁned for q in a geodesic neighborhood Up of p; and
(b) The m-plane ˜T denotes the parallel transport of T along the unique minimizing geodesic

from q to p.

J. HARRISON & H. PUGH

for all geodesic m-planes D Ă Up and compact m-rectiﬁable sets X Ă Up which contain BD
and do not retract onto BD; and
(b) The function f is equi- lower semicontinuous, in the sense that for each pp, Tq P T mC and each
 ą 0 there exists δ ą 0, independent of T , such that if dpp, qq ă δ, then fpp, Tq ď fpq, ˜Tq`.

Then f is elliptic. Indeed, aside from a slight broadening of the collection of sets X which must
satisfy (2), the assumption (a) is precisely the ellipticity condition deﬁned in [Alm68] 1.2.
Note that if C1 Ă C and if f is elliptic in W , then the restriction of f to T mC1 is elliptic in
W X C1. Thus, f : T mC Ñ ra, bs is elliptic if and only if there exists an elliptic extension of f to a
neighborhood of C.

We want to emphasize that ellipticity is more a property of the functional Fm rather than the
function f itself. Indeed, ellipticity can be deﬁned for a collection of measures, as follows:
Deﬁnition 2.1.1. Suppose W Ă C. Let Υ be a collection of ﬁnite Borel measures on C and suppose
µ P Υ is m-rectiﬁable. We say Υ is µ-elliptic in W if for µ-almost every p P W such that µ has
an approximate tangent space E with multiplicity8 θ at p, there exists a neighborhood U of C and
some b ą 0 such that the following holds: given  ą 0 there exists s ą 0 such that if 0 ă r ă s, then
(3)
for every ν P Υ and compact set Z Ă Bpp, rq satisfying the following conditions:

pθ ´ qHmpEpp, rqq ď νpZ X Cq ` bHmpZzsupppνqq

(a) Z X BBpp, rq “ E X BBpp, rq;
(b) There is no retraction Z Ñ E X BBpp, rq;
(c) Z is m-rectiﬁable if ν is m-rectiﬁable;

We say Υ is elliptic in W if it is µ-elliptic in W for every m-rectiﬁable measure µ P Υ.

If (3) holds in the more general case that Z satisﬁes, in place of (b),

(b)’ There is no Lipschitz retraction Z Ñ E X BBpp, rq which is C 0 close to the diﬀeomorphisms

of Rn which ﬁx Bpp, rqc,

then we say Υ is strongly elliptic.

For example, if f : T mC Ñ ra, bs is elliptic in W and X ranges over a collection of closed sets which
are m-rectiﬁable in W , then the collection of measures tFmtXXWu is elliptic in W . If (1) holds for
all m-rectiﬁable compact sets Z Ă Bpp, rq such that

(a) Z X BBpp, rq “ E X BBpp, rq; and
(b) There is no Lipschitz retraction from Z onto E X BBpp, rq which is C 0 close to the diﬀeo-

morphisms of Rn which ﬁx Bpp, rqc,

then the associated collection of measures tFmtXXWu is strongly elliptic.

Observe that f need only be deﬁned on the union of the sets XzA, where X ranges over elements of
SpA, C, K, mq. Moreover, for Theorem 2.0.6 to hold, the sets XzA need not be m-rectiﬁable as long
as the measures µX satisfy Deﬁnition 2.1.1.

3. Constructions

Lemma 3.0.1 is a slight generalization of [DS00] Proposition 3.1, which is a version of the Federer-
Fleming projection theorem [FF60] 5.5, ﬁrst modiﬁed for sets in [Alm68] 2.9 (see [Fed86] for a much
simpler proof.) Given a (closed) n-cube Q Ă Rn and j ě 0, let ∆jpQq denote the collection of
n-cubes in the j-th dyadic subdivision of Q. For 0 ď d ď n let ∆j,dpQq denote the collection of the
d-dimensional faces of the n-cubes in ∆jpQq and let Sj,dpQq Ă Q denote the union of these faces.
Lemma 3.0.1. Suppose E is a compact subset of Q such that HdpEq ă 8. For each j ě 0, there
exists a Lipschitz map φ : Rn ˆ r0, 1s Ñ Rn with the following properties:

(a) φt “ Id on Qc Y Sj,dpQq for all t P r0, 1s;
(b) φ0 “ Id;
(c) φ1pEq Ă Sj,dpQq Y BpQq;
(d) φpR ˆ r0, 1sq Ă R for each R P ∆jpQq;
(e) Hdpφ1pE X Rqq ď c1HdpE X Rq for all R P ∆jpQq where c1 “ c1pnq depends only on n;
(f ) Hd`1pφpE X R ˆ r0, 1sqq ď c12´jdiampQqHdpE X Rq for all R P ∆jpQq.
(g) If E is semi-regular of dimension d9, that is, there exists a constant K ą 0 such that
for x P Rn and 0 ă r ď R, the set Epx, Rq can be covered by a collection of at most
KpR{rqd closed balls of radius r, then the Lipschitz constant of φ1 depends only on n and
K. Furthermore, there exists a constant δ ą 0 depending only on n and K such that if
F Ă Q X NpE, δ2´jdiampQqq, then φ1pFq Ă Sj,dpQq Y BpQq.

Proof. The map φ is the concatenation of the straight line homotopies between the maps ψm in
[DS00] Lemma 3.10. Parts (a)-(e) are [DS00] Proposition 3.1. Part (f) is then apparent from [Rei60]
(cid:3)
Lemma 6 and [DS00] (3.14.) Part (g) follows from [DS00] Lemma 3.31 and (3.33.)
Corollary 3.0.2. Suppose pC, X, Aq is a compact triple, C is a uniform localizable Lipschitz retract,
and X spans L. Let p P CzA and suppose r ą 0 is chosen smaller than the retraction radius of C at
p, and so that Npp, rq X A “ H and Hm´1pxpp, rqq ă 8. Then for every  ą 0 there exist compact
sets P Ă Cpp, rq and T Ă Cpp, rq such that

(a) T Ă Npxpp, rq, rq;
(b) HmpTq ď c1rHm´1pxpp, rqq;
(c) HmpPq ď γrm where 0 ă γ ă 8 depends on n, C and ;
(d) If xpp, rq is pm ´ 1q-rectiﬁable, then P Y T is m-rectiﬁable;
(e) P Y T Y pXzXpp, rqq spans L.

Proof. Let πp,r : Rn Ñ Cpp, rq denote the Lipschitz retraction given by Deﬁnition 2.0.1. Let Q be a
n-cube of side length 2r centered at p and apply Lemma 3.0.1 to d “ m ´ 1 and E “ xpp, rq. Let

T “ πp,r ˝ φpxpp, rqˆr0, 1sq and P be the image under πp,r of the inward cone of the set φ1pxpp, rqq
with cone point p. It follows from Lemma 3.0.1 (d) and (f) that we may choose j large enough so
that (a) and (b) hold. (d) holds since φ and πp,r are Lipschitz. [HP15] Lemmas 1.2.2, 1.2.4, and
1.2.10 imply (e). It remains to show (c).
Let N be an upper bound on the number of pm´1q-dimensional faces of a cubical grid of side length
2´jpq within  of BBp0, 1q. Since φ1pxpp, rqq Ă Npxpp, rq, rq X Sj,m´1pQq, it follows from [Rei60]

Lemma 3.0.3. Under the same assumptions as Lemma 3.0.1, suppose U Ă E is Hd measurable
and purely d-unrectiﬁable, and ¯U Ă 8Q. Then for 0 ď j ă 8 large enough, there exists a map φ
satisfying Lemma 3.0.1 (b)-(g) such that

Hdpφ1pUqq “ 0

φt “ Id on Qc for all t P r0, 1s.

Proof. We construct the map φ as follows. Choose j large enough so that U is contained entirely
within the subset of cubes in ∆jpQq which do not have any faces on the boundary of Q. Within
those cubes, approximate the maps ψk, d ď k ă n deﬁned in the proof of [DS00] Proposition 3.1 by
diﬀeomorphisms ˜ψk. For each d ď k ă n, the image of U by the map τk ” ˜ψk ˝ ¨¨¨ ˝ ˜ψn´1 remains
purely d-unrectiﬁable and τkpEq will be contained in an open -neighborhood of ∆j,kpQq.
The map φ1 is the composition φ1 ” ρ˝ θ ˝ τd, where the maps ρ and θ are deﬁned below. The map
φ is deﬁned as in Lemma 3.0.1 to be the concatenation of the straight-line homotopies between the
maps ψn, ˜ψn´1, . . . , ˜ψd, θ, and ρ.
By the Besicovitch-Federer projection theorem, for each 0 ă δ ă  and each d-face F P ∆j,dpQq
there exists an aﬃne d-plane ˜F such that F Ă Np ˜F , δq, and such that the image of φdpUq by the
orthogonal projection Θ ˜F : Rn Ñ ˜F has zero Hausdorﬀ d-measure.
Let ζ ą 2 and deﬁne θ on NpF, qzNpBF, ζq to be the map ΘF ˝ Θ ˜F , where ΘF denotes orthog-
onal projection onto the aﬃne d-plane deﬁned by F . We may extend θ as a Lipschitz map on
Np∆j,dpQq, q X Bp∆j,d´1pQq, ζq so that
(6)
and so that the Lipschitz constant of θ depends only on n. Finally, extend θ to Rn as a Lipschitz
map.
The map ρ is deﬁned on each face F P ∆j,dpQq as follows: Let q be the center point of F and let
χq,ζpxq denote the point

θpNp∆j,dpQq, q X Bp∆j,d´1pQq, ζqq Ă ∆j,dpQq X Np∆j,d´1pQq, 2ζq,

Then ρ is Lipschitz with Lipschitz constant close to 1 (controlled by ζ.) Finally, extend ρ to Rn,
with proportional Lipschitz constant.
Note that by (6), Hm almost all θpUq is contained in ∆j,dpQq X Np∆j,d´1pQq, 2ζq, and this region
is collapsed onto ∆j,d´1pQq by ρ. Thus, (4) holds. It is apparent that (5) holds, as well as Lemma
3.0.1 (b)-(d). To see (e) and (f), it is enough to observe that [DS00] (3.20) still holds for the modiﬁed
(cid:3)

that if L1 “ L3 “ L4 “ H and SpA, C, L, mq is non-empty, then there exists such a sequence tXku.
The existence of such a sequence follows in exactly the same manner if L1 ‰ H by replacing the

where p is any point in tpiuiPI . The last inequality is due to (26) and the fact that 41 is a lower
bound for dp for p P Y .
The general case follows from the ﬁniteness of µ0 and compactness of Y . Indeed, if r ă 1 ď R, then
it is enough to show that Y can be covered by Cr´m balls of radius r. The proof is the same as the
ﬁrst case, replacing µ0pBpp, 4Rqq with µ0pRnq in the antepenultimate line. If 1 ď r ď R, then it is
enough to show that Y can be covered by C balls of radius 1, and such a ﬁnite C exists since Y is

Corollary 4.0.10. If E is an approximate tangent m-plane for X0zA at p P X0zA, and 0 ă  ă 1,

Proof. By (14) and Corollary 4.0.8, we may apply Lemma 3.0.5 to the set X “ X0zA.
Theorem 4.0.11 (Rectiﬁability). The measure µ0tAc is m-rectiﬁable.

Proof. By Corollary 4.0.8, it is enough to show that X0zA is m-rectiﬁable. Write X0zA “ R Y P

Now apply Lemma 3.0.3 to the cube Q1 and the sets “U ” “ P X Q and “E” “ X0X Q1. By Corollary

We will need to apply the map φ1 to Xk for k large. Since Xk Ñ X0 in the Hausdorﬀ metric, it

φ1pXk X Q1q Ă Sj,dpQ1q Y BpQ1q.

For each k ě 1 let νk denote the measure Hmtφ1pXkXQ1q and let ν0 be a subsequential limit of

Note that supppν0q Ă Q1. More speciﬁcally, supppν0q Ă φ1pX0 X Q1q, for if x R φ1pX0 X Q1q and
x P Q1, then since φ1 is proper, there is an open neighborhood V of x whose closure is disjoint from

Note that the entire discussion above remains valid if Fm is replaced with any measure proportional

Theorem 5.0.2. If V Ă Ac is open, then

FmpX0 X V q ď lim inf

kÑ8 FmpXk X V q.

The idea of the proof is to form a Vitali-type covering of X0 X V by disjoint balls Bppi, riq where X0
has an approximate tangent plane Ei at pi. The ellipticity condition on f will provide a lower bound
for FmpXkppi, riqq in terms of fppi, Eiqαmrm
i and a small error. Lusin’s theorem and rectiﬁability
of µ0 will provide an upper bound for F mpX0ppi, riqq, again in terms of fppi, Eiqαmrm
i and a small

Proof. Since FmpXkzAq ă 8, k ě 0, it suﬃces to prove the claim for V disjoint from a neighborhood
0 be the full Hm measure subset of X0 X V consisting of those points p such that
of A. Let X1
ΘmpX0, pq “ 1 and for which X0 has an approximate tangent m-plane Ep at p.
Fix 0 ă  ă 1{2. By Lusin’s theorem there exists an Hm measurable Z Ă X1

For each j P N there exists a Lipschitz map φj : Rn Ñ Rn such that
(a) φj is the identity outside Aj ” App, , rjq X NpE, rjq;
(b) φjpAjq “ Aj;
(c) On App, {3,p1 ´ {3qrjq X NpE, rj{2qq, the map φj is orthogonal projection onto E;
(d) φj is C 0-close to a diﬀeomorphism;
(e) The Lipschitz constant of φj depends only on n.
By Corollary 4.0.7 and (44) it holds that for small enough  ą 0, we may increase the
constant Nj so that if k ě Nj, then φjpXkq contains E X BBpp,p1 ´ {2qrjq.
Indeed, if
E X BBpp,p1 ´ {2qrjq contains a point q which is not in φjpXkq, then we may orthogonally
project φjpXkpp,p1´ {2qrjqq onto E, and then radially project the resulting set away from q
onto EXBBpp,p1´ {2qrjq. For  ą 0 small enough, the image of φjpXkq by this map will be
contained in the neighborhood U of C, and we may apply the Lipschitz retraction π : U Ñ C
to create a new sequence tYku Ă SpA, C, L, mq. The sets Yk satisfy Yk “ XkzBpp, rjq Y Zk,
where HmpZkq ď κmCV rm
j , and κ ă 8 depends only on the Lipschitz constants of φj and
π. Using the density bounds in Corollary 4.0.7, we conclude that inftFmpYkqu ă m yielding
a contradiction (c.f. the proof of Theorem 4.0.11 after (38).)
Moreover, there can be no retraction from φjpXkqpp,p1´{2qrjq onto EXBBpp,p1´{2qrjq,
for if there exists such a retraction ρ, then by the Stone-Weierstass theorem for locally
compact spaces, it can be assumed without loss of generality to be Lipschitz. As a Lipschitz
map, ρ can then be extended by the identity to BBpp,p1 ´ {2qrjq, then to the rest of
Bpp,p1´ {2qrjq using the Kirszbraun theorem, and then ﬁnally by the identity to all of Rn.
The sequence tπpρpXkqqu Ă SpA, C, L, mq will yield a contradiction for the same reason as
above.

Thus, by the ellipticity of f and (44), it holds that for large enough j and k ě Nj,

In particular, FmpX0zAq “ m. This completes the proof Theorem 2.0.4 in the case that L3 “ L4 “
H. Theorem 2.0.6 is a straightforward generalization of Theorem 2.0.4.

The case of Theorem 2.0.4 in which L3 and L4 are not necessarily empty follows from Theorem 2.0.6,
since SpA, C, L, mq is closed under Hausdorﬀ limits (this is a straightforward modiﬁcation of [HP15]
Lemma 1.2.17,) the map Y ÞÑ supppµYq Y A (this is a straightforward modiﬁcation of [HP15]
Lemma 1.2.18,) and the action of Lipschitz functions g : C Ñ C which ﬁx A and are homotopic to
the identity relative to A (by homotopy invariance.)
