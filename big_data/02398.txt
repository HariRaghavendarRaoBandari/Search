In this paper,we have studied phase transitions of higher dimensional charge black

hole with spherical symmetry. we calculated the local energy and local tempera-

ture, and ﬁnd that these state parameters satisfy the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics

. We analyze the critical behavior of black hole thermodynamic system by taking

state parameters (Q, Φ) of black hole thermodynamic system, in accordance with

considering to the state parameters (P, V ) of Van der Waals system respectively. we

obtain the critical point of black hole thermodynamic system, and ﬁnd the critical

point is independent of the dual independent variables we selected. This result for

asymptotically ﬂat space is consistent with that for AdS spacetime, and is intrinsic

property of black hole thermodynamic system.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the study of critical behavior of black holes has still received a lot of

attention. Particularly, the idea of including the variation of the cosmological constant Λ

in the ﬁrst law of black hole thermodynamics has attained increasing attention. Matching

the thermodynamic quantities with the ones in usual thermodynamic system, the critical

behavior of black holes can be investigated and the phase diagram like the van der Waals

vapor-liquid system, critical exponents and Clapeyron equations can be obtained [1–14].

For the de Sitter spacetime, the thermodynamics properties and phase transition of black

hole with the method of the equivalence quantities has been investigated, and it is shown

that the result is similar with AdS black hole [15–20]. This helps to further understand black

hole entropy, temperature, heat capacity, et.al, and it is also very important to improve the

self-consistent geometric theory of black hole thermodynamics.

As is well known, there are Hawking radiations for black holes in asymptotically ﬂat

spacetime and non-asymptotically ﬂat ones. Because the heat capacity of black hole in

asymptotically ﬂat spacetime is negative, this black hole in asymptotically ﬂat space is

thermodynamically unstable. We verify the thermodynamic stability of black holes ﬁrstly

should veriﬁed the black hole is thermodynamics stable to correctly study their thermody-

namic properties and phase transitions.

In order to restore thermodynamic stability so that equilibrium thermodynamics and the

phase structure can be studied, we must consider the whole systems that include not only

the black hole under consideration but also their environment [21, 22]. As self-gravitating

systems are spatially inhomogeneous, which is diﬀerent from the usual thermodynamic sys-

tem. Any speciﬁcation of such system requires not just thermodynamic quantities of interest

but also the place at which they take the speciﬁed values. In this paper, we have studied

the phase transition of higher dimensional charged black hole with spherical symmetry. To

solve this problem we can place the black hole inside a ﬁnite concentric spherical cavity,

whose radii is ﬁxed and larger than the one of black hole. The temperature is ﬁxed on the

surface of the cavity, which could be physically realized by placing a heat bath around the

cavity. We will keep the charge inside the cavity also ﬁxed. This will deﬁne a canonical

ensemble [23–28]. We will study the phase structure and the thermodynamic properties of

the various dimensional charged black hole in this ensemble.

Refs. [29–35] have investigated the critical behavior of various black hole in AdS spacetime

with Ehrenfest scheme. They found that the phase transition of black hole is the continuous

one in AdS spacetime, and the thermodynamic quantities of the critical point satisﬁes the

Ehrenfest equation. Refs. [36–38] have obtained the same conclusion by studying the ther-

modynamics and state space geometry of black hole in AdS space. Moreover, it is interesting

to study the thermodynamics behavior of the ensemble, which we construct for asymptotical

ﬂat space, and identify whether the ensemble meet with the Ehrenfest equation. We obtain

the phase diagram for the thermodynamics quantities(Q, Φ) at the critical point, and the

result similar to that in AdS black hole. The thermodynamic quantities satisfy the Ehrenfest

3

equation, so the corresponding phase transition is a continuous phase transition.

The paper is arranged as follows: In Sec.2 we ﬁrst review the higher dimensional charged

black hole in asymptotically ﬂat space, and give the quasilocal thermodynamics quantities

of the canonical ensemble. In Sec.3 the critical behavior in diﬀerent dimensional charged

black hole is investigated. Finally, the paper ends with a brief conclusion. (we use the units

Gd =  = kB = c = 1)

III. THE CRITICAL EFFECTIVE IN CHARGED BLACK HOLE IN CAVITY

For the thermodynamic ensemble, we take the sate parameters Tloc, S as the independent

variables to study the critical behaviors of thermodynamics ensemble. When these state

parameters Q and rB are invariable quantities, the critical value of black hole radii rB, black

hole event horizon r+ and the black hole temperature are decided by,

(cid:18) ∂Tloc
∂r+ (cid:19)rB ,Q

We can calculate the position of the critical points in diﬀerent dimensional spacetime. The

results are shown in Table 1(we take rB = 1),

near critical point with the charge Q ≤ Qc. The critical temperature Tloc increases as the

spacetime dimension d increases. From the heat capacity of system

CQ = Tloc(cid:18) ∂S
∂Tloc(cid:19)

(3.2)

we can ﬁnd that the instability state will appear with the charge of spacetime is littler

the critical charge. By using Maxwell’s equal area law we discover the possible two-phase

coexistence curves in the process of phase transition [39, 40].

Next, let us calculate the free energy of the black hole in order to study phase transition

between the black holes and the hot ﬂat space [24, 28].

F = Eloc − TlocS.

(3.3)

We can plot the relations curve for the free energy F and the local temperature Tloc, with

rB = 1, and Q takes values near critical charge. Fig.2 shows the system is the two-phase

coexistence state, when the charge of black hole is smaller than the critical charge Qc. This

result is consistent with Fig.1. From Table 1, it is found that the critical temperature and

critical charge increase as the spacetime dimension increases. This result is consistent with

the conclusion in Refs. [3] for higher dimensional AdS black hole.

Further, We can plot the curve for the free energy F and the local temperature Q, with

rB = 1, and Tloc take values near critical temperature in Fig.3. From the Fig.3, we can

see that there is a phase transition at the quasilocal temperature smaller than the critical

quasilocal temperature in diﬀerent dimensionas. The results is consistent with the proﬁle of

F − Tloc in Fig.2.

From the (2.12), we know that we can select the independent variables (Q, Φ) or (σ, A)

for the black hole thermodynamic ensemble. When taking the rB and Tloc as constant, we

select the dual independent variables (Φ, Q), the critical position is given by the following

conditions,

Comparing Eqs. 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5, we can ﬁnd that the equation of critical point is same.

So we can obtain the same critical point with diﬀerent independent dual variable in the

thermodynamics system. The critical point is unaltered with the choose for independent

dual variables.

of phase transition is called the second-order phase transition. For Van der Waals system

there is no latent heat and the liquid-gas structure do not change suddenly at the critical

point. Therefore this kind of phase transition belongs to the second-order phase transition

and continuous phase transition. To discuss the critical behaviors of system near the phase

From Eqs. 3.1, 3.4 and 3.5, we know that these quantities α, kT and CQ, which obtained in

Eq 3.6, approach to inﬁnity at the critical point. So the phase transition, which happens in

the black hole thermodynamics ensemble, is an continuous phase transition. The Gibbs free

energy and the ﬁrst order partial derivation for these two phase is continuous at the critical

point of continuous phase. We also depict the curves of α − r+, κ − r+ and CQ − r+ in the

(3.14)

Hence, when Q is constant, the phase transition occurred at Tloc = T c

loc is a second order
equilibrium transition. This is true in spite of the fact that the phase transition curves are

smeared and divergent near the critical point. This result is in agreement with the result of

the AdS black holes.

IV. DISCUSS AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, to study the properties of black hole in asymptotically ﬂat spacetime, we

built a stable black hole thermodynamic ensemble in the view of thermodynamics. we cal-

culated the local energy and local temperature, and ﬁnd that these state parameters satisfy

the ﬁrst law of thermodynamic Eq.(2.12). Based on this condition, we analyze the critical

behavior of black hole thermodynamic ensemble through taking the state parameters (Q, Φ)

of black hole thermodynamic ensemble corresponding to the state parameters (P, V ) of Van

der Waals system respectively. we obtain the critical point of black hole thermodynamic

system, and ﬁnd the critical point is independent of the dual independent variables we se-

lected. This result for asymptotically ﬂat space is consistent with the conclusion for AdS

spacetime [1], and is an intrinsic property of black hole thermodynamic ensemble. Firstly,

From Table 1 we can ﬁnd that the critical temperature and critical charge of black hole

ensemble increase with the spacetime dimensional increase, which is similar to the critical

12

behavior of AdS black hole. Secondly, the second partial derivative α, κT , CQ of Gibbs free

energy of black hole thermodynamic ensemble is divergent at the critical point, the result

is the same to the result of AdS spacetime. Finally, the Prigogine-Defay(PD) relation at

critical point in black hole thermodynamic ensemble is consistent with the AdS black hole.

The PD ration satisﬁes Eq.(3.14) and is independent with spacetime dimension.

In the black hole thermodynamic ensemble, we built a concentric spherical cavity, whose

radii is ﬁxed and larger than the ones of black hole, to achieve the condition of thermody-

namic stability for black hole ensemble. The reason, which AdS black hole can achieve the

thermodynamic stability, is that there is a cosmology constant Λ. Through comparing the

critical behavior of thermodynamic ensemble with the ones of AdS spacetime, we can argue

that the radii rB of concentric spherical cavity is related to the cosmology constant Λ in the
