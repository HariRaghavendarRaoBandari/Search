1. Introduction

Let k be an algebraically closed ﬁeld and A an abelian variety deﬁned over k. Our
purpose here is to show how the Riemann-Roch theorem for divisors on A is related to
the reduced norms of the Wedderburn components of R := End0(A) := Q ⊗Z End(A) the
Q-endomorphism algebra of A. We then turn to applications and examples.

The key point to what we do here is Theorem 4.1 and a special case of this result applies to
1 ×· · ·×Ark
principally polarized abelian varieties (ppav). To describe it, suppose that A = Ar1
k
with each of the Ai simple and pairwise non-isogenous abelian varieties. Also assume that A
admits an ample divisor λ which deﬁnes a principal polarization of A. Let rλ : R → R denote
the Rosati involution determined by λ, [11, p. 175]. Since λ is a principal polarization, it
determines an isomorphism Φλ : NS(A)
−→ Endλ(A) between the Neron-Severi group of A
and the subgroup Endλ(A) := {α ∈ End(A) : rλ(α) = α} ⊂ End(A) of End(A) ﬁxed by rλ,
[11, p. 176], [6, p. 49].

Next write R = R1 × · · · × Rk with Ri ≃ Mri(∆i) for division rings ∆i over Q, let Zi
denote the centre of ∆i, m2
i := dimZi ∆i, ti := [Zi : Q], gi := dim Ai and g := dim A. Also
let NrdRi/Q(·) denote the reduced norm from Ri to Q. In this notation, a consequence of
Corollary 3.7 is that the function

kYi=1

NrdRi/Q(·)2gi/(timi) : R → Q

restricted to End0
of degree g on End0
this polynomial function by

λ(A) := Q⊗Z Endλ(A) is the square of a homogeneous polynomial function
λ(A) normalized so as to take value 1 when evaluated at 1R; we denote

in what follows. In this setting, a consequence of Theorem 4.1 is:

Theorem 1.1. If D is a divisor on the ppav A just described and α = Φλ(D) ∈ Endλ(A),
then

(1.1)

(Dg)

g!

= pNrdλ(α).

We prove Theorem 1.1 in §4. To place this theorem and the more general Theorem 4.1
into their proper context we should ﬁrst emphasize that these theorems are essentially due
to Mumford and are implicit in [11, p. 194]. Our contribution here is to make them slightly
more explicit and then to indicate some consequences, for example Theorems 4.4 and 5.1.
A related question, which we address to some extent in §5, §6, and §7, is to understand
the righthand side of (1.1) explicitly for a given R and principal polarization λ. To place
these matters into perspective we recall that, especially when char k > 0, it is already an
interesting and subtle problem to understand those semi-simple Q-algebras that are actually
realized as End0(A) for some abelian variety A; see [12] and [13, Corollary 1.2], for example.

University of New Brunswick where I was ﬁnancially supported by an AARMS postdoctoral
fellowship.

2. Preliminaries

We ﬁx some notation and recall some prerequisites which are important in what follows.

We refer to [11], [2], [3], and [14], for example, for more details.

2.1. If R is a simple Q-algebra with centre Z, then R ≃ Mr(∆) for ∆ a division ring over
Q and we let m denote the Schur index of ∆, that is m2 := dimZ(∆) ∆ for Z(∆) ≃ Z the
centre of ∆, [2, Corollary 7.22] and [3, p. 732]. Put t := [Z : Q]. We then have that
dimZ R = r2m2 =: d2 and also that dimQ R = td2.

2.2. We let NrdR/Q := NrZ/Q ◦ NrdR/Z denote the reduced norm from R to Q; here NrdR/Z
denotes the reduced norm from R to Z and, in particular, if E is a maximal subﬁeld of ∆,
then E⊗Z R ≃ Mrm(E) and NrdR/Z(α) for α ∈ R, equals the determinate of the matrix Mα ∈
Mrm(E) corresponding to α under this isomorphism. We also let TrdR/Q := TrZ/Q ◦ TrdR/Z
denote the reduced trace from R to Q. As with NrdR/Z , TrdR/Z(α), for α ∈ R, equals the
trace of the matrix Mα, [14, §9.a].
2.3. If R is a semi-simple Q-algebra with Wedderburn decomposition R = R1 ×· · ·× Rk, for
matrix algebras Ri ≃ Mri(∆i) over pairwise non-isomorphic division rings ∆i with centres
Zi, then we let mi denote the Schur index of ∆i, ti := [Zi : Q], and di := miri. The reduced
i=1 NrdRi/Q

norm and reduced trace, respectively, from R to Q are deﬁned as NrdR/Q :=Qk

REDUCED NORMS AND THE RIEMANN-ROCH THEOREM FOR ABELIAN VARIETIES

and TrdR/Q := Pk

i=1 TrdRi/Q, [14, p. 121]. By a positive involution on R, we mean a Q-
linear map ′ : R → R which satisﬁes the conditions that (αβ)′ = β ′α′ for all α, β ∈ R and
TrdR/Q(αα′) > 0 for all nonzero α ∈ R, [11, p. 179].
2.4. We consider abelian varieties deﬁned over a ﬁxed algebraically closed ﬁeld k of arbitrary
characteristic. If A is an abelian variety, of dimension g, then we let ˆA denote its dual and
we also let R := End0(A) := Q ⊗Z End(A) denote the Q-endomorphism algebra of A. If
a ∈ A(k), then we let τa : A → A denote translation by a in the group law. Every divisor
D on A determines a homomorphism φD : A → ˆA deﬁned by a 7→ τ ∗
aOA(D) ⊗ OA(−D),
[11, Corollary 5, p. 122]. If φ ∈ End0(A), then we let ˆφ ∈ End0( ˆA) denote its dual, [11,
p. 76, Corollary 4, p. 122]. If λ is an ample divisor on A, then we let rλ : R → R denote
the Rosati-involution deﬁned by α 7→ φ−1
If n ∈ Z, then we let
[n]A : A → A denote multiplication by n in the group law.
2.5. We denote the g-fold self-intersection number of a divisor D on A by (Dg), NS(A)
the Neron-Severi group of divisors on A modulo algebraic equivalence, and NS0(A) := Q ⊗Z
NS(A) the Neron-Severi space of A. Every ample divisor λ on A determines a Q-linear
embedding Φλ : NS0(A) ֒→ End0(A) deﬁned by sending the class of a divisor D to the
endomorphism φ−1
λ(A) := {α ∈
End0(A) : rλ(α) = α} of symmetric elements of End0
λ(A) with respect to rλ, [11, p. 176].
If λ determines a principal polarization of A, then Φλ determines a Z-linear isomorphism
Φλ : NS(A)
−→ Endλ(A) where Endλ(A) := {α ∈ End(A) : rλ(α) = α}, [6, p. 49]. By abuse
of notation, when no confusion is likely, we denote the class of a divisor D on A in NS(A)
also by D.

λ ◦φD ∈ End0(A). The image of Φλ is the Q-vector space End0

λ ◦ ˆα ◦ φλ, [11, p. 175].

3. Isogenies and the degree function

In this section we record some facts about isogenies between abelian varieties and the
degree function. The main point is to establish Proposition 3.5 and its corollaries which we
need in §4.
3.1. Let α : B1 → B2 be a homomorphism of abelian varieties. Recall [9, p. 114] or [11,
p. 60], that α is an isogeny if it is surjective and has ﬁnite kernel. If α is an isogeny, then
we deﬁne its degree, which we denote by deg(α), to be the order of its kernel. This concept
can be extended to all homomorphisms from B1 to B2. In particular, we have the degree
function:

(3.1)

deﬁned by:

(3.2)

deg : Hom(B1, B2) → Z

deg(α) :=(deg(α)

0

if α is an isogeny
otherwise.

4

NATHAN GRIEVE

Such functions also have the properties that

deg(β ◦ α) = deg(β) deg(α)

(3.3)
for all triples of abelian varieties B1, B2, and B3, together with α ∈ Hom(B1, B2) and
β ∈ Hom(B2, B3), [9, p. 115].
3.2. The function deg : End(A) → Z extends to a degree function deg : End0(A) → Q; this
function is a homogeneous polynomial function of degree 2g, [11, Theorem 2, p. 162] or [9,
Proposition 12.4, p. 123]. The degree functions (3.1) also extend to give degree functions:

(3.4)
Indeed, given α ∈ Hom(B1, B2) and n ∈ Z, the morphism nα ∈ Hom(B1, B2) is deﬁned by
x 7→ nα(x). In particular, nα = [n]B2 ◦ α and so:

deg : Hom0(B1, B2) := Q ⊗Z Hom(B1, B2) → Q.

deg(nα) = deg([n]B2 ◦ α) = deg([n]B2) deg(α).

Now, given α ∈ Hom0(B1, B2), let n be an integer so that nα ∈ Hom(B1, B2) and deﬁne:
(3.5)

deg(α) :=

deg(nα)
deg([n]B2)

.

The deﬁnition (3.5) is well deﬁned and extends that given in (3.2). The extended degree
functions (3.4) also behave well with respect to composition of morphisms as in (3.3).

3.3. We record the following for later use.

Lemma 3.1. If D is a divisor on A, we then have:

(3.6)

deg(φD) =

deg(Φλ(D))

deg(φ−1
λ )

= deg(φλ) deg(Φλ(D)).

Proof. In light of the formula (3.3), it suﬃces to note deg(Φλ(D)) = deg(φ−1

λ ) deg(φD). (cid:3)

3.4. Every isogeny β : B → A induces a ring isomorphism
[β] : End0(B) → End0(A)
(3.7)

deﬁned by

(3.8)

[β](α) = β ◦ α ◦ β −1;

here β −1 denotes the inverse of β, that is β −1 = (1/n)γ where n = deg β and γ is the unique
isogeny A → B so that γ ◦ β = [n]B and β ◦ γ = [n]A, [11, p. 160]. The homomorphism (3.7)
behaves well with respect to the degree homomorphism. In particular:
deg([β](α)) = deg(β) deg(α) deg(β −1) = deg(α),

(3.9)
for all α ∈ End0(B).

REDUCED NORMS AND THE RIEMANN-ROCH THEOREM FOR ABELIAN VARIETIES

Functorial properties of the isomorphism Φλ with respect to β and the inverse of (3.7) are
explained in [6, p. 50]. Here we record the following related remark which we will need in
what follows.
Proposition 3.2. Let rβ ∗λ : End0(B) → End0(B) denote the Rosati involution determined
by the ample divisor β ∗λ on B. Then if α ∈ End0(B), it follows that
(3.10)

[β](rβ ∗λα) = rλ([β](α)).

Proof. We compute

whereas

[β](rβ ∗λα) = β ◦ φ−1

β ∗λ ◦ ˆα ◦ φβ ∗λ ◦ β −1

The conclusion of the proposition will follow if we can show that

rλ([β](α)) = φ−1

λ ◦dβ −1 ◦bα ◦bβ ◦ φλ.

ˆβφλ = φβ ∗λβ −1.

(3.11)

To establish (3.11), it suﬃces to show that

(3.12)

equivalently that

(3.13)

ˆβφλβ = φβ ∗λ;

β ∗(τ ∗

β(b)OA(λ) ⊗ OA(−λ)) ≃ τ ∗

b β ∗OA(λ) ⊗ β ∗OA(λ),

for all b ∈ B. That (3.13) holds can be checked using the fact that β ◦ τb = τβ(b) ◦ β for all
b ∈ B.

(cid:3)

Proposition 3.2 has the following consequence.

Corollary 3.3. If β : B → A is an isogeny, then the morphism [β] induces the following
collection of linear maps:

(3.14)

NS(B) ֒→ NS0(B)

∼

−→ End0

β ∗λ(B)

∼

−→ End0

λ(A) ⊂ End0(A).

Proof. Immediate consequence of (3.10) and the deﬁnitions of End0

β ∗λ(B) and End0

λ(A). (cid:3)

For later use we also record:

Lemma 3.4. Let A = Ar1
k with the abelian varieties Ai simple and pairwise
non-isogenous. If β : B → A is an isogeny, if α ∈ End0(B) and [β](α) = (α1, . . . , αk) with
αi ∈ End0(Ari

1 × · · · × Ark

i ), then

(3.15)

deg(α) =

deg(αi).

kYi=1

6

NATHAN GRIEVE

Proof. Since, by (3.9), the degree function behaves well with respect to the ring isomorphism
[β], without loss of generality we may assume that A = B and that β = idA. Also, in light
of the deﬁnition (3.5), without loss of generality we may assume that α ∈ End(A). If α is
not an isogeny, then some αi is also not an isogeny and the formula holds. On the other
hand, if α is an isogeny, then each of the αi must be an isogeny and clearly

#(ker α) =

#(ker αi).

kYi=1

(cid:3)

3.5. We use our remarks made thus far to prove the main results of this section. To prepare
for these statements, let A = Ar1
k with each Ai simple abelian varieties and
pairwise non-isogenous. Let gi := dim Ai and write R := End0(A) = R1 × · · · × Rk with
∆i = End0(Ai) and Ri = Mri(∆i); we adopt the notation of §2.3.
Proposition 3.5. In the setting of §3.5 just described, the following assertions hold true:

1 × · · · × Ark

(a) 2gi/(timi) ∈ Z for i = 1, . . . , k;

i=1 NrdRi/Q(αi)2gi/(timi).

(b) deg(α) =Qk

Proof. Because of the multiplicative nature of the degree function, namely (3.15), it suﬃces
to show that, for i ﬁxed,

(a’) 2gi/(timi) ∈ Z
(b’) deg(αi) = NrdRi/Q(αi)2gi/(timi).

To this end, we know that deg(·) : Ri → Q is a norm function of degree 2giri while NrdRi/Q(·)
is a norm function of degree tidi. Thus by [11, Lemma on p. 165], we must have

(3.16)

deg(·) = NrdRi/Q(·)ni

for some positive integer ni. In particular, nitidi = 2giri and so

(3.17)

ni = 2gi/(timi) ∈ Z

which proves (a’). Assertion (b’) follows from (3.16) and (3.17).
Corollary 3.6. If A is as in §3.5 and if β : B → A is an isogeny, α ∈ End0(B) and
[β](α) = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ End0(A), then

(cid:3)

(3.18)

deg(α) =

NrdRi/Q(αi)2gi/(timi).

kYi=1

Proof. Combine (3.15) and Proposition 3.5 (b).

(cid:3)

Corollary 3.7. With A as in Proposition 3.5 and B as in Corollary 3.6, the functions

(3.19)

and

(3.20)

kYi=1

NrdRi/Q(·)2gi/(timi)|End0

λ(A) : End0

λ(A) → Q

kYi=1

NrdRi/Q(·)2gi/(timi)|End0

β ∗λ(B) → Q

are both squares of rational valued homogeneous polynomial functions of degree g on End0
and End0
respectively.

λ(A)
β ∗λ(B) respectively normalized so as to take value 1 when evaluated at 1A and 1B

Proof. The conclusions desired by Corollary 3.7 follow from Proposition 3.5 and (3.18) in
conjunction with the Riemann-Roch theorem, [11, p. 140].
Indeed, in order to establish
(3.19), let α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ End0
λ(A). Then α = Φλ(D) for some class of a Q-divisor D.
We ﬁrst assume that D is integral. Then α = φ−1

λ φD and so by (3.6):

(3.21)

deg(α) = deg(φ−1

λ ) deg(φD).

Using (3.21) together with Proposition 3.5 (b) and the Riemann-Roch theorem [11, p. 140],
we obtain:

(3.22)

g! (cid:19)2
(cid:18) (Dg)

=(cid:18) (λg)

g! (cid:19)2 kYi=1

NrdRi/Q(αi)2gi/(timi).

By Q-linearity, the formula (3.22) also holds for the case that D is a Q-divisor. Finally, since
the left hand side of (3.22) is clearly the square of a homogeneous polynomial function of
degree g on End0

λ(A), the same is true for the formula (3.19).

The formula (3.20) is established in the same manner by replacing λ with β ∗λ and using
(cid:3)

the Riemann-Roch theorem for divisors on B.

3.6. Notation. In what follows, we denote the normalized degree g homogeneous polyno-
mial functions whose squares are (3.19) and (3.20) respectively by:

(3.23)

and

(3.24)

pNrdλ(·) : End0

λ(A) → Q

pNrdβ ∗λ(·) : End0

β ∗λ(B) → Q.

4. The Riemann-Roch and index theorems for Abelian varieties

4.1. The Riemann-Roch theorem. Suppose that A = Ar1
k with Ai simple
and pairwise non-isogenous abelian varieties. Let g := dim A, gi := dim Ai and write R :=
End0(A) = R1 × · · · × Rk with ∆i = End0(Ai) and Ri = Mri(∆i). We also ﬁx an ample
divisor λ on A, an isogeny β : B → A, and we use the other notational conventions described
in §2.3.

1 × · · · × Ark

We interpret the Riemann-Roch theorem, see [11, p. 140] for example, in terms of the
polynomial functions (3.23) and (3.24) determined by the reduced norms of the Wedderburn
components of R and the numbers mi, ti and gi.

Theorem 4.1. In the setting of §4.1 just described, the following assertions hold true:

(a) If D is a Q-divisor on A and Φλ(D) = α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ End0
pNrdλ(α) =pdeg φλpNrdλ(α).

(λg)

(4.2)

β ∗λ(B) ⊂

Proof. We content ourselves with proving (4.1) as the proof of (4.2) follows similarly by
replacing λ with β ∗λ. To achieve our goal, we have, by (3.22) and (3.23), that

(4.3)

(Dg)

g!

= C ×

(λg)
g!

pNrdλ(α),

for some constant C independent of D. To solve for C, we replace D by λ in (4.3). Since
Φλ(λ) = 1R and pNrdλ(1R) = 1, we conclude that C = 1.
(cid:3)

As a special case of Theorem 4.1 we have the following consequence which we also stated

in §1 as Theorem 1.1.
Corollary 4.2. If λ is a principal polarization on A, D a divisor on A and α = Φλ(D),
then

(4.4)

(Dg)

g!

= pNrdλ(α).

Proof of Corollary 4.2 and Theorem 1.1. Follows from (4.1) because if λ is a principal po-
larization, then (λg) = g!.
(cid:3)

REDUCED NORMS AND THE RIEMANN-ROCH THEOREM FOR ABELIAN VARIETIES

4.2. The index theorem. Let A be an abelian variety of dimension g. We let λ be an
ample divisor on A and D a Q-divisor on A. The Hilbert polynomial of D with respect to λ
is the polynomial

(4.5)

Hpλ(D; N) :=

1
g!

((Nλ + D)g) ∈ Q[N].

In the case that D is integral, then the roots of the polynomial (4.5) are real [10, Theorem
2, p. 98] and [11, p. 145]. Furthermore, if K(D) := {a ∈ A(k) : τ ∗
aOA(D) ≃ OA(D)},
then the dimension of K(D) equals the multiplicity of zero as a root of (4.5). Also, counting
the roots of Hpλ(D; N) with multiplicity, it follows that Hj(A,OA(D)) = 0 for 0 6 j <
# of positive roots and Hg−j(A,OA(D)) = 0 for 0 6 j < # of negative roots, [10, Theorem
2, p. 98].

Let i(D) be the number of roots of the polynomial (4.5). This number is independent of
the choice of ample divisor λ, [10, p. 99], and we refer to this number as the index of D.
Since the polynomial (4.5) is well-deﬁned modulo numerical equivalence, the number i(D)
is also well-deﬁned modulo numerical equivalence. In particular it is well-deﬁned modulo
algebraic equivalence.

To deﬁne the index of a Q-divisor D, let n be a positive integer so that nD is integral and

deﬁne i(D) = i(nD).

Lemma 4.3. Let D be a Q-divisor on A. The number i(D) is well-deﬁned and equals the
number of positive roots counted with multiplicity of the polynomial Hpλ(D; N).

Proof. We simply note:

(4.6)

Hpnλ(nD; N) =

1
g!

((Nnλ + nD)g) =

ng
g!

((Nλ + D)g) = ngHpλ(D; N).

(cid:3)

4.3. We now return to the setting of §4.1. The following theorem and its corollary are
essentially due to Mumford.
Indeed, they can be seen as slightly more explicit forms of
calculations performed in [11, p. 194].
Theorem 4.4. In the setting of §4.1, the following assertions hold true:

(a) If D is a Q-divisor on A and Φλ(D) = α = (α1, . . . , αk) ∈ End0

the number of positive roots counted with multiplicity of the polynomial

λ(A), then i(D) equals

(4.7)

pD,λ(N) := pNrdλ(N idA +α).
(b) If D is a Q-divisor on B and [β]Φβ ∗λ(D) = α ∈ End0

of positive roots counted with multiplicity of the polynomial

λ(A), then i(D) equals the number

(4.8)

pD,β ∗λ(N) := pNrdβ ∗λ(N idB +Φβ ∗λ(D)) = pNrdλ(N idA +α).

10

NATHAN GRIEVE

Proof. To prove (a), by Lemma 4.3, we need to determine the number of positive roots of
the polynomial

(4.9)

Hpλ(D; N) =

1
g!

((Nλ + D)g).

On the other hand, by Theorem 4.1 (a), the roots of this polynomial are the same as those
of the polynomial

(4.10)

(λg)
g!

pNrdλ(N idA +α)

and (a) clearly follows. Assertion (b) follows similarly with λ replaced by β ∗λ.

(cid:3)

5. The index theorem for simple abelian varieties

In this section we consider consequences of Theorem 4.4 when applied to simple abelian

varieties.

5.1. Let A be a simple abelian variety of dimension g, λ an ample divisor on A, ∆ :=
End0(A), Z the centre of ∆ and K ⊆ Z the subﬁeld ﬁxed by the Rosati involution rλ. Then
K is a totally real ﬁeld, [11, p. 179, 186-87]. As in §2.4 we let m denote the Schur index of
the division ring ∆ and t := [Z : Q]. Let e := [K : Q] and σ1, . . . , σe the embeddings of K
into R.

Suppose that D is a divisor on A with the property that Φλ(D) = α ∈ K. We then have:

(5.1)

Nrd∆/Q(α) = NrK/Q(α)m[Z:K] =

σi(α)m[Z:K]

eYi=1

and so the polynomial pD,λ(N) = pNrdλ(N idA +α) takes the form:

(5.2)

pD,λ(N) = pNrdλ(N idA +α) =

(N idA +σi(α))g/e,

eYi=1

where byQe
Z × K to Q whose square isQe

5.2. Examples.

i=1(N idA +σi(α))g/e in (5.2) we mean the normalized polynomial function from

i=1(N idA +σi(α))2g/e.

(i) If the pair (∆, rλ) is type I in the sense of [11, Theorem 2, p. 186-87], then ∆ = K

and e|g. The polynomial (5.2) takes the form:

(5.3)

pD,λ(N) = pNrdλ(N idA +α) = NrK/Q(N idA +α)g/e.

REDUCED NORMS AND THE RIEMANN-ROCH THEOREM FOR ABELIAN VARIETIES

11

(ii) Suppose that the pair (∆, rλ) is type IV in the sense of [11, Theorem 2, p. 186-87]
but with ∆ = Z. Then ∆ is a totally imaginary quadratic extension of K and e|g,
see [11, p. 187]. As a consequence, the polynomial (5.2) takes the form:

(5.4)

pD,λ(N) = pNrdλ(N idA +α) = NrK/Q(N idA +α)g/e.

The following result is motivated by [4] and [5], especially [4, §2], and provides,
5.3.
amongst other things, a fairly complete characterization of the pair index condition, in the
sense of [4, §2.3, p. 1450036-7], as it pertains to pairs of line bundles on simple abelian
varieties deﬁned over algebraically closed ﬁelds of arbitrary characteristic. It should also be
compared with [4, Theorem 2.2, p. 1450036-8] and the more general [4, Theorem 2.3, p.
1450036-9].
Theorem 5.1. In the setting of §5.1, the following assertions hold true:

(a) If D ∈ NS0(A) and Φλ(D) = α ∈ K, then i(D) = g
(b) If D1, D2 ∈ NS0(A) are such that Φλ(D1) = α1 ∈ K and Φλ(D2) = α2 ∈ K, then

e (#{j : σj(α) < 0});

i(D1) + i(D2) = i(D1 + D2)

if and only if

{j : σj(α1 + α2) < 0} = {j : σj(α1) < 0} ⊔ {j : σj(α2) < 0}.

(c) Let n = g/e. Then for all p, q > 0 with nq + np 6 g, there exists integral classes

D1, D2 ∈ NS0(A) which satisfy the conditions that:
(i) (Dg
(ii) Φλ(D1) ∈ K, Φλ(D2) ∈ K; and
(iii) i(D1) = np, i(D2) = nq, and i(D1 + D2) = i(D1) + i(D2).

1) 6= 0, (Dg

2) 6= 0; and

Proof. Part (a) is a consequence of (5.2) combined with Theorem 4.4 (a). Part (b) is an
immediate consequence of (a). Part (c) can be proven in a manner similar to the proof of [4,
Theorem 2.2]. Indeed, ﬁrst ﬁx disjoint subsets I, J ⊆ {1, . . . , e} with #I = p and #J = q.
Next, let U ⊆ R⊕2e be the subset consisting of those (x1, . . . , xe, y1, . . . , ye) ∈ R⊕2e with the
property that xk < 0 if k ∈ I, xk > 0 if k 6∈ I, yk < 0 if k ∈ J, yk > 0 if k 6∈ J and xk +yk < 0
for all k ∈ I ∪ J. Then U is a non-empty open subset of R⊕2e. On the other hand, by [8, p.
135] for instance, the set

S := {(σ1(α1), . . . , σe(α1), σ1(α2), . . . , σe(α1)) : (α1, α2) ∈ K ⊕2}

is dense in R⊕2e and we deduce that U ∩ S 6= ∅.

Considering the deﬁnitions of U and S, we conclude that there exists α1, α2 ∈ K with the

property that:

(a’) σk(α1) < 0 if k ∈ I and σk(α1) > 0 if k 6∈ I
(b’) σk(α2) < 0 if k ∈ J and σk(α2) > 0 if k 6∈ J
(c’) σk(α1) + σk(α2) < 0 if k ∈ I ∪ J.

Consequently, if we ﬁx D1, D2 ∈ NS0(A) with ρλ(D1) = α1 and ρλ(D2) = α2, then some
positive scalar multiple of D1 and D2 will satisfy the conditions desired by (c).

Corollary 5.2. For each p, 0 6 p 6 e, A admits an integral divisor D with i(D) = gp/e.

Proof. Follows from Theorem 5.1 (c).

6. Products of abelian varieties

In order to describe the right hand side of (4.7) and (4.8) explicitly, we need a clear
understanding of End0
λ(A). To get a sense for some of the issues involved, in this section we
consider the case of product polarizations on products of abelian varieties. The main point
is to prove Proposition 6.1 and Corollary 6.2 which we use in §7 where we consider examples.
6.1. Let Ai, for i = 1, . . . , k, be abelian varieties with ample divisors λi. As in [6, p. 50],
for each ηji ∈ Hom0(Ai, Aj), let
(6.1)
If each of the λi determine principal polarizations of the Ai, then rλi,λj (ηji) ∈ Hom(Aj, Ai)
whenever ηji ∈ Hom(Ai, Aj).
6.2. Let A = A1 × · · · × Ak, pi : A → Ai the projection and ei : Ai ֒→ A the inclusion.
i λi on A. If α ∈ End0(A), then deﬁne αij := piαej ∈
Hom0(Aj, Ai). We then have:

λi ◦cηji ◦ φλj ∈ Hom0(Aj, Ai).

Let λ denote the ample divisorPk

rλi,λj (ηji) = φ−1

i=1 p∗

(6.2)

and

(6.3)

End(A) = {(αij)k

i,j=1 : αij ∈ Hom(Aj, Ai)}

End0(A) = {(αij)k

i,j=1 : αij ∈ Hom0(Aj, Ai)}.

The following proposition is useful for working with examples and is an evident

6.3.
extension of [6, Proposition 61, p. 51]; see also [7, Lemma 2.3, p. 88] and [1, p. 1003].
Proposition 6.1. In the setting of §6.2, we have that
(6.4)

λ(A) = {(αij) : αij = rλi,λj (αji), αij ∈ Hom0(Aj, Ai)}.

End0

Also, if each of the λi determine principal polarizations of the Ai, then it is also true that:

(6.5)

Endλ(B) = {(αij) : αij = rλi,λj (αji), αij ∈ Hom(Aj, Ai)}.

Proof. See [6, p. 51] for the case k = 2 and λi principal polarizations. The desired more
general case is proved similarly.
(cid:3)

A consequence of Proposition 6.1 is:

Corollary 6.2. If B = Ar = A × · · · × A

λ⊠r (B) = {(αij) : αij = rλ(αji), αij ∈ End0(A)}.

If λ determines a principal polarization, then

(6.7)

Endλ⊠r (B) = {(αij) : αij = rλ(αji), αij ∈ End(A)}.

Proof. Follows from Proposition 6.1 because λi = λ, for i = 1, . . . , k, and so rλi,λj (αji) =
rλ(αji).
(cid:3)

6.4. Remark. As in [6, Proposition 61], the equality (6.4), and similarly for (6.5), can be
seen as an isomorphism

which induces an isomorphism

When each of the λi are principal polarizations, we similarly have isomorphisms

When A = E1×E2 for Ei elliptic curves, the isomorphisms (6.10) and (6.11) are important
in establishing the main results of [6]. Here the main focus is not the isomorphisms (6.8)–
(6.11) but rather the useful (6.6) which we use to illustrate some of our theorems here, for
instance Theorems 4.1 and 4.4.

7. Examples

In this section we show how Theorem 4.1, Corollary 4.2 and Theorem 4.4 can be used
to study the Neron-Severi space of the self product of certain simple abelian varieties. Our
calculations, among other things, allow for a more complete understanding of [4, Example
7.1.1, p. 1450036-25].

7.1. Let us suppose that B = Ar for (A, λ) a principally polarized abelian variety with
End(A) an order oK in K a totally real number ﬁeld of degree g over Q. We then have that
Endλ(A) = End(A) = oK, [11, p. 186], End(B) = Mr(oK) and End0(B) = Mr(K).

Also, by Corollary 6.2, it follows that

(7.1)

then

λ⊠r (B) = {(αij) ∈ Mr(K) : (αij) = (αji)},

λ(B),

(7.2)
Note also that if α = (αij) ∈ End0
then

deg(α) = NrK/Q(det(α)).
λ(B) has the form α = Φλ⊠r (D) for some D ∈ NS0(A),

g!

and the polynomial pD,λ(N) has the form
(7.4)

pD,λ(N) = pNrdλ(N idA +α) = NrK/Q det(N idA +α).

7.2. Let us now specialize the discussion of §7.1 to the case that g = 1 and r = 2. In this
case A = E an elliptic curve with End(E) = Z. Let λ = 0E the identity of E. We then have

End0

λ⊠2(B) =(cid:26)(cid:18)x y

y w(cid:19) : x, y, w ∈ Q(cid:27) ,

and if D ∈ NS0(A) has image

in End0

λ⊠2(B), then

pD,λ(N) = det(cid:18)N + x

y

Φλ(D) =(cid:18)x y
y w(cid:19)
N + w(cid:19) = N 2 + (x + w)N + wx − y2.

y

Considering the roots of the polynomial (7.5) we deduce that N = 0 will be a root of
multiplicity 2 if and only if x = y = w = 0 while if N = 0 is a root of multiplicity 1, then
i(D) = 0 if and only if x + w > 0 while i(D) = 1 if and only if x + w < 0. On the other
hand, N = 0 is not a root if and only if wx − y2 6= 0 and in this case i(D) = 0 if and only if
wx − y2 > 0 and x + w > 0, i(D) = 1 if and only if wx − y2 < 0, and i(D) = 2 if and only if
wx − y2 > 0 and x + w < 0.
7.3. Next we consider the case that B = Ar for (A, λ) a principally polarized abelian
variety with End0(A) = Z a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real ﬁeld
K = End0

λ(A) with [K : Q] = g. We then have End0(B) = Mr(Z),
λ⊠r (B) = {(αij) ∈ Mr(Z) : αij = αij},

End0

Considering (7.8) we deduce that N = 0 will be a root with multiplicity 2 if and only if
x = y = w = z = 0 and that if N = 0 is a root of multiplicity 1, then i(D) = 0 if and
only if x + y > 0 while i(D) = 1 if and only if x + y < 0. On the other hand, N = 0 will
not be a root if and only if −z2 + w2f + xy 6= 0 and in this case, i(D) = 0 if and only if
z2 + w2f + xy > 0 and x + y > 0, i(D) = 1 if and only if −z2 + w2f + xy < 0, and i(D) = 2
if and only if −z2 + w2f + xy > 0 and x + y < 0.
7.5. As our ﬁnal example we suppose that char k > 0 and consider the case that A = E× E
for E a super-singular elliptic curve. We then have that End(E) is an order in End0(E) =
K = Q ⊕ Qa ⊕ Qb ⊕ Qab, and that the multiplication in K satisﬁes the conditions that
a2, b2 ∈ Q, a2 < 0, b2 < 0, and ba = −ab, [15, p. 100-102].

Additionally, if α = x+ya+zb+wab ∈ K, with x, y, z, w ∈ Q, then α′ = x−ya−zb−wab,
TrdK/Q(α) = α+α′, and NrdK/Q(α) = αα′; here ′ denotes the Rosati involution rλ determined
by λ = 0E the identity of E. Let a2 = a and b2 = b.

Now let R = End0(A) = M2(K), and ′ : R → R the Rosati involution rλ⊠2. Keeping with
the conventions of §2.1, we have that d2 = [R : Q] = 16, and t = [Z : Q] = 1, for Z the

We also have, for such α, that NrdR/Q(α) = det(α) = (ab2w2 − b2z2 − ay2 − uv + x2)2

and it follows, using our normalization conventions (3.19), that

Equation (7.11) implies that if D is a divisor on A with

In particular, for a divisor D as in (7.12), the polynomial pD,λ(N) takes the form:

(7.14)

pD,λ(N) = N 2 + (u + v)N + uv − x2 − w2ab + z2b + y2a.

Considering (7.14) we deduce that N = 0 will be a root with multiplicity 2 if and only if
u = v = x = y = w = z = 0 and that if N = 0 is a root of multiplicity 1, then i(D) = 0 if

REDUCED NORMS AND THE RIEMANN-ROCH THEOREM FOR ABELIAN VARIETIES

and only if u + v > 0 while i(D) = 1 if and only if u + v < 0. On the other hand, N = 0
will not be a root if and only if uv − x2 − w2ab + z2b + y2a 6= 0 and in this case, i(D) = 0
if and only if −w2ab + z2b + y2a + uv − x2 > 0 and u + v > 0, i(D) = 1 if and only if
−w2ab + z2b + y2a + uv− x2 < 0, and i(D) = 2 if and only if −w2ab + z2b + y2a + uv − x2 > 0
and u + v < 0.

Let also also note that (7.13) can be used to compute intersection numbers.

Indeed,

suppose that D1 and D2 are divisors on A with
