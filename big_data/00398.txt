The discovery of graphene, a single monolayer of graphite, closed the discussion on stability of 2D
crystals. Although thermal ﬂuctuations of such crystals tend to destroy the long-range order in the
system, they can be stabilized by strong anharmonicity eﬀects, which preserve thermodynamic sta-
bility. This competition is the central issue of crumpling transition, i.e. transition between ﬂat and
crumpled phases governed by the ratio of the bending rigidity κ of the crystal to the temperature T .
The graphene is deeply in the ﬂat phase because κ/T ≃ 30 (at room temperature and at the atomic
scales) and renormalizes in a power-law way with increasing the system size: κ/T ∝ Lη, where
η ≈ 0.7 is the critical index of the crumpling transition. Critical ﬂuctuations of graphene membrane
around ﬂat equilibrium phase lead to unusual elastic properties. In particular, we demonstrate that
stretching ξ of a ﬂake of graphene turns out to be nonlinear function of the applied tension at small
tension: ξ ∝ ση/(2−η) and ξ ∝ ση/(8−η) for clean and strongly disordered graphene, respectively.
Conventional linear Hooke’s law, ξ ∝ σ is realized at suﬃciently large tensions: σ ≫ σ∗, where σ∗
depends both on temperature and on the disorder strength. We also study the eﬀect of tension on
the crumpling transition as well as properties of dynamical and static correlation functions of disor-
dered suspended graphene under tension. Two diﬀerent phases within the ﬂat phase are identiﬁed
that are characterized by diﬀerent scaling behavior of the singular part of ﬂuctuations.

Hooke’s law is a fundamental law of the nature.

It
states that the force needed to extend or compress an
elastic body by some distance is proportional to that dis-
tance. The law was introduced by Robert Hooke about
350 years ago. Conventional theory of elasticity predicts
that this law is fulﬁlled for low ﬁelds (in the so-called
“elastic range” of tensions) and gets violated at suﬃ-
ciently large tensions.

The goal of this paper is to explore stretching of
graphene, a famous two-dimensional (2D) material [1–
10], as a reaction on applied tension. Measurement of
the elasticity of free-standing graphene is accessible to
current experimental techniques [11–13]. Remarkably,
we ﬁnd that, for graphene, Hooke’s law fails even in the
limit of the inﬁnitesimally small tension. The underlying
physics has a very close relation to the well known prob-
lem of thermodynamic stability of 2D crystals [14, 15].

Free-standing graphene is a remarkable example of an
elastic crystalline 2D membrane with a high bending
rigidity κ ≃ 1 eV. The most important feature distin-
guishing such a membrane from conventional 2D semi-
conductor systems is the existence of speciﬁc type of out-
of-plane phonon modes—ﬂexural phonons (FP) [16].

In contrast to in-plane acoustic phonons with the lin-
ear dispersion, the FP are very soft, ωq ∝ q2, and, con-
sequently, the out-of-plane thermal ﬂuctuations are un-
usually strong and tend to destroy graphene membrane
by driving it into the so-called crumpled phase [16]. It
turns out, however, that anharmonicity eﬀects play here
a very important role.

This question was intensively discussed more than two
decades ago [16–33] in connection with biological mem-
branes, polymerized layers, and inorganic surfaces. The
interest to this topic has been renewed more recently [34–
41] after discovery of graphene.
It was found [17–23]
that the anharmonic coupling of in-plane and out-of-
plane phonons stabilizes the membrane for not too high
temperatures T . This is connected with a strong (power-
law) renormalization of the bending rigidity [22, 24, 30],
κ → κq ∝ q−η,
for q → 0, with a certain critical index
η. Due to the high bare value of κ, graphene remains
ﬂat up to temperatures several times higher than the
room temperature. The critical exponent η was de-
termined within several approximate analytical schemes
[20, 22, 23, 30, 34]. Numerical simulations for a 2D mem-
brane embedded in 3D space yield η = 0.60 ± 0.10 [28]
and η = 0.72 ± 0.04 [33].
In a recent paper [42], we have developed a theory
of rippling and crumpling in disordered free-standing
graphene. We have shown that random ﬂuctuations of
the membrane curvature caused by static disorder may
strongly aﬀect properties of the membrane. We have de-
rived coupled renormalization-group (RG) equations de-
scribing the combined ﬂow of κ and disorder strength b,
determined the phase diagram (ﬂat vs. crumpled) in the
κ − b plane, and explored the rippling in the ﬂat phase.
In the present paper, we explore the fate of Hooke’s
law in clean and disordered graphene. We ﬁnd that linear
Hooke’s law breaks down both for clean and disordered
cases, so that deformations of the membrane subjected to

a small tension scale as ∆L ∝ σα, with a non-trivial expo-
nent α. (Note that this is valid for the case of stretching
force, σ > 0 and ∆L > 0. In the opposite case, ∆L < 0,
the membrane undergoes a buckling transition [21].) We
obtain the critical index α that turns out to be diﬀer-
ent for clean and disordered cases. Our ﬁndings imply
that for suﬃciently strong disorder the anomalous elas-
ticity of graphene is fully determined by static random
deformations—ripples. The non-linearity of elasticity of
graphene found in this work is in agreement with recent
experimental ﬁndings [12, 13]. Related theoretical results
have been recently obtained for clean membranes in the
ribbon geometry [43] and by numerical simulations [44].
We consider a 2D membrane embedded in the d-
dimensional space (d > 2). The starting point of our
analysis is the energy functional

which can be obtained from the general gradient expan-
sion of elastic energy [19] by using a certain rescaling of
coordinates (see discussion in [42]). Here κ is the bare
bending rigidity, while µ and λ are the mean-ﬁeld values
of in-plane coupling constants. The d−dimensional vec-
tor r = r(x) describes a point on the membrane surface
and depends on the 2D coordinate x that parametrizes
the membrane. The vector r can be split into r =
ξx + u + h, where vectors u = (u1, u2), h = (h1, ..., hd−2)
represent in-plane and out-of-plane displacements, re-
spectively. The stretching factor ξ is equal to unity in
the mean-ﬁeld approximation, but gets reduced due to
ﬂuctuations. In terms of u, h, and ξ, Eq. (1) reads

where ˜u = ξu and E0(˜u, h) describes energy of in-plane
and out-of-plane ﬂuctuation. We proceed now to include
the static disorder. As was found in Ref. [42], the relevant
disorder is represented by the random curvature. The
energy of ﬂuctuations including such disorder reads [26]

FIG. 1: Due to dynamical and static ﬂuctuations, a mem-
brane shrinks in the longitudinal direction (bottom), as com-
pared to the membrane without ﬂuctuations (top).

value of ξ deviates from the mean-ﬁeld value ξ = 1 due to
the ﬂuctuations. The size of the membrane with ﬂuctua-
tions R is related to the size L of the membrane without
ﬂuctuations as follows: R = ξL. Hence, the “projected”
area of the membrane reads A = ξ2L2.

In the absence of tension, the equilibrium value of

stretching factor reads [42, 45]

ξ2 = 1 − h∂αh∂αhi /2.

(4)

Application of a ﬁnite tension σ to the membrane leads
to the increase of ξ2, as compared to the value given by
Eq. (4). Below we calculate ξ as a function of applied σ,
both for clean and disordered cases.

Clean case. Let us start with considering the clean
case, b = 0. With the tension σapplied, the propagator

imation is given by [45]

where b is the disorder strength and Zβ is a normalization
factor. In the absence of disorder (β = 0), Eq. (3) coin-
cides with the conventional expression for elastic energy
of nearly ﬂat membrane [16].

The second term in the square brackets in Eq. (2) de-
scribes the coupling between ﬂuctuations and stretching.
Such a coupling leads to shrinking of the membrane in the
x−plane as illustrated in Fig. 1. As a result, the optimal

(7)

Conventional Hooke’s law can be derived from Eq. (6) by
neglecting the contribution of ﬂuctuations and assuming
that ξ is close to unity: σconv ≈ 2(µ + λ) (ξ − 1). The
main purpose of the further discussion is to demonstrate
that the contribution of ﬂuctuations is of crucial impor-
tance, so that this law fails in the limit σ → 0. In fact,
stretching of the membrane turns out to be a nonlinear
function of σ.

For large momenta, q > qσ, where qσ =pσ/κ, Green’s
function is approximately given by G0
q = T /κq4. The
strong infrared singularity G0
q ∝ 1/q4 leads to a logarith-
mic divergence of h∂αh∂αhi and, consequently, in view

of Eq. (4), to the renormalization of ξ [42]. Hence, ξ
becomes scale-dependent: ξ → ξL, where L ∼ q−1. At
ﬁnite q, the renormalization is stopped because of the
term σq2 in the denominator of G0
q. To determine the q-
dependence of the renormalization of ξ, one should take
into account that the bending rigidity is also renormal-
ized for suﬃciently small wave vectors q ≪ q∗ according
to the RG equation [22, 24, 30],

dκ/dΛ = ηκ.

(8)

Here Λ = ln(q∗/q), η is the anomalous dimension of the
bending rigidity, q∗ is the inverse Ginzburg length,

q∗ ≃pµ T /κ,

(9)

and µ = 3µ(µ + λ)/[8π(2µ + λ)], see Ref. [42]. According
to Eq. (8), the renormalized rigidity reads

κq = κ (q∗/q)η .

(10)

Below, we assume that q∗ ≫ qσ. In this case, a compe-
tition between the two terms in the denominator of G0
q
leads to appearance of a new spatial scale determined by
condition κqq2 = σ,

qσ = qσ (qσ/q∗)η/(2−η) .

(11)

Next, we calculate h∂αh∂αhi with the use of Eq. (10)
and substitute it in Eq. (6) (see [45] for technical details).
This yields an equation that determines the dependence
of ξ = ξL→∞ on σ [46],

rigidity (for given temperature T ). For dc ≫ 1, when
η = 2/dc, one gets κcr = d2
c T /(8π) [20, 42]. For σ = 0,
Eq. (12) simpliﬁes,

ξ2 = ξ2

T = 1 − T /Tcr,

(13)

where Tcr = 4πηκ/dc is the temperature of crumpling
transition for a given value of bare bending rigidity κ.
For T < Tcr, the stretching factor is ﬁnite, ξT > 0, and
the membrane is in the ﬂat phase. For T > Tcr, the
membrane undergoes a crumpling transition, so that ξ
turns to zero for a certain ﬁnite system size L < ∞. It is
worth noting that Eq. (13) predicts a negative expansion
coeﬃcient of the membrane, dξT /dT < 0.

For σ 6= 0, we rewrite Eq. (12) as

where σT = κq2
Equation (14) represents a general form of Hooke’s law
for clean membrane. The l.h.s. of this equation con-
tains two terms: a regular term, proportional to σ, and
an irregular one that shows a fractional scaling with σ.
Analytical approximations [30], as well as numerical sim-
ulations [28, 33] for the physical case D = 2, d = 3,
show that η/(2 − η) is smaller than unity and lies in the
interval between 0.4 and 0.7. Hence, the irregular term
dominates at small σ, and stretching of the membrane
shows an anomalous power-law behavior, while the con-
ventional linear Hooke’s law is realized for suﬃciently
large tensions, σ ≫ σ∗. For graphene, where µ ∼ λ ∼ µ,
we ﬁnd for the crossover tension σ∗ at T ≪ Tcr,

σ∗ ≃ µT /κ,

and for the corresponding stretching ξ∗,

ξ∗ − ξT ≃ T /κ ≪ 1.

(15)

(16)

The above results can be easily generalized to arbi-
trary dimensionality of the membrane, D > 2, by re-
placing the integration measure in Eq. (12), d2q → dDq.
This leads to the following replacement of the critical
index in Eq. (14): η/(2 − η) → (D − 2 + η)/(2 − η). In
a generic membrane, one may introduce two exponents,
governing the stretching in the anomalous regime. Far
from the transition point, for ξT 6= 0 one can expand
ξ2 − ξ2

T ≈ 2(ξ − ξT )ξT , thus ﬁnding
ξ − ξT ∝ σ(D−2+η)/(2−η),

for T < Tcr.

(17)

Exactly at the transition point, ξT = 0 and

(12)

ξ ∝ σ(D−2+η)/[2(2−η)],

for T = Tcr.

(18)

Equations (17) and (18) were obtained previously in
Refs. [21, 23] for η = 0, which corresponds to the case
dc = ∞ [47], and predicted in [24] from scaling consid-
erations.
It was also argued in Refs. [21, 23] that the
membrane undergoes a transition into a buckled phase
at the point σ = 0.

As seen from Eq. (14), the tension leads to an increase
of Tcr and, respectively, to a decrease of κcr. Indeed, set-
ting ξ = 0 in Eq. (14) and assuming that σ ≪ σ∗, we
ﬁnd the tension-induced change of the critical tempera-
ture, δTcr/Tcr = −δκcr/κcr ≃ (σ/µ)η/(2−η).
Disordered case. The derivation of perturbative RG
equations for disordered graphene is performed by us-
ing replica trick within RPA scheme, in analogy with the
case σ = 0 studied in Ref. [42]. Technical details of cal-
culations are presented in [45]. The analysis is controlled
by a parameter 1/dc which is assumed to be small. We
ﬁrst use Eq. (1) of [45] to ﬁnd h∂αh∂αhi in the harmonic
approximation. Here angular brackets denote the Gibbs

where f = bκ/T is a dimensionless parameter character-
ising the ratio of disorder to thermal ﬂuctuations. For
ﬁxed κ and f, the integral in Eq. (19) logarithmically
diverges for κq2 ≫ σ and saturates for κq2 ≪ σ. In view
of Eq. (4), we conclude that ξ is renormalized [46]:

(20)

As shown in Ref. [42], the Ginzburg scale q∗ is aﬀected

by disorder: q∗ ∼pµT (1 + 2f )/κ. For strong disorder
or low temperatures, f ≫ 1, we ﬁnd that

Hence, stretching of a strongly disordered membrane is
a nonlinear function of weak tension, just as in the clean
case. However, the corresponding power-law exponents
diﬀer from that of a clean system, Eqs. (17) and (18).
Conventional Hooke’s law is realized for σ ≫ σ∗, where
the crossover tension σ∗ and stretching ξ∗ are given by

σ∗/µ ≃ ξ∗ − ξB ≃ B(8−η)/(8−2η)

for

f ≫ 1.

(27)

As seen from Eq. (20), the RG ﬂow for ξ stops at q ∼ qσ.
This means that crumpling can occur only for q ≫ qσ,
while the region q ≪ qσ is reachable in the ﬂat phase.
Interestingly, the RG ﬂows for κ and f do not stop at
the point q ∼ qσ. The derivation of corresponding RG
equations is analogous to the case σ = 0 discussed in
Ref. [42]. One ﬁnds that for q ≪ qσ the bending rigidity
and the dimensionless disorder strength obey (see [45] for
technical details)

q∗ ∼pµb/κ

(21)

is independent of temperature, while for weak disorder
(f ≪ 1), we recover Eq. (9), q∗ ∝ T 1/2. Below we show
that qσ is also modiﬁed by suﬃciently strong disorder.
In the harmonic approximation, κ and f are con-
stants. However, they become scale-dependent due to
the coupling between in-plane and out-of-plane ﬂuctua-
tions: κ → κq and f → fq. For q ≫ qσ, corresponding
RG equations were derived in Ref. [42] for dc ≫ 1:

For strong disorder, f ≫ 1, the RG equations simplify:
dκ/dΛ = ηκ/4 and df /dΛ = −3η/4. The ﬁrst equation
yields κq = κ(q∗/q)η/4. Equating κqq2 to σ, we ﬁnd qσ,

qσ = qσ (qσ/q∗)η/(8−η) ,

(23)

where q∗ is given by Eq. (21). Since κ changes faster
than f, one can set f = const in Eq. (20). Using Eq. (6),
we ﬁnd the equation which determines dependence of ξ
on σ for a strongly disordered membrane:

σ

+ B(cid:18) σ

µ(cid:19)η/(8−η)

= ξ2 − 1 + B,

(24)

where B = bd2
c/2π. It worth noting that the tempera-
ture drops out from this equation. For σ = 0, we ﬁnd
that ξ2 = ξ2
B = 1 − B, so that the crumpling transition
(ξ = 0) corresponds to B = Bcr = 1 in agreement with
previous study (see Fig. 5 of Ref. [42]) . As seen from
Eq. (24), the tension enhances the critical value of dis-
order: δBcr ≡ Bcr − 1 ≃ (σ/µ)η/(8−η). In analogy with
Eqs. (17) and (18), we ﬁnd

ξ − ξB ∼ B (σ/µ)η/(8−η) ,

√B (σ/µ)η/[2(8−η)] ,

Note that κf = const. Equations (28) have an un-

stable ﬁxed point fcr = 6 + 4√3 ≈ 12.9. Hence, the ﬂat

phase can be separated into two parts: a phase where
the bending rigidity increases with the system size
(f < fcr) and a phase where the membrane becomes
softer at larger scales (f > fcr.)
In both phases,
κqq2 ≪ σ, so that the scaling of κ is irrelevant for
the crumpling transition and the membrane remains
ﬂat even for f > fcr. These two phases can be
distinguished by behavior of the membrane ﬂuctua-
tions, both dynamical and static (ripples). To charac-
terize these ﬂuctuations, we introduce the correlation
functions [31, 42]: H d(x) = h∂αh(0)∂αh(x)i − H s(x),
H s(x) = h∂αh(0)i h∂αh(x)i. Here, h. . .i stands for aver-
aging over dynamical ﬂuctuations in a given disorder re-
alization, while the overbar means averaging over disor-
der. Functions H d
q are given by ﬁrst and second
term in Eq. (19), respectively. For q ≪ qσ, we get

Here we keep corrections of the ﬁrst order with re-
spect to the small parameter κq2/σ. Solving Eq. (28),
we ﬁnd that the leading contributions to both dynam-
ical and static functions are regular (i.e., do not show

= dcT fqκqq2/σ2 ∝ q2, each behaving in the
same way in the two phases [both for f > fcr and
f < fcr]. However, small corrections which we keep in

with α = η/(8 − η) ≃ 0.1, where we use the numerical
value of the exponent η ≃ 0.7. In the opposite limit of
high temperatures, T ≫ 300 K, we get the anomalous
Hooke’s law exponent α = η/(2 − η) ≃ 0.5. This non-
linear elasticity law holds up to the crossover tension
σ∗ ≃ 1 · 10−2 eV/˚A and stretching ξ∗ − ξT ∼ 0.01. For
f ∼ 1 (corresponding to T around the room tempera-
ture), the exponent α takes a non-universal value be-
tween the above two limits. Furthermore, it ﬂows as a
function of σ, tending to the clean value ≃ 0.5 for smallest
strains. The exact dependence of stretching on tension
can be found in this regime by a numerical integration of
RG equations (22).

It is convenient to introduce the eﬀective elasticity co-
eﬃcient keﬀ = ∂σ/∂ξ. Using Eqs. (17) and (25) for the
dependence of σ on ξ in the clean and strongly disordered
cases, respectively, we ﬁnd, in the regime of anomalous
Hooke’s law,

keﬀ ∝(cid:26) (ξ − ξT )(2−2η)/η,
(ξ − ξB)(8−2η)/η,

for f ≪ 1,
for f ≫ 1.

(31)

The eﬀective elasticity modulus is thus strongly reduced
for a weak strain, vanishing at the point of the buckling
transition.

Our results compare well with the recent detailed ex-
perimental study of graphene elasticity [13]. It was found
in this work that the room-temperature in-plane stiﬀness
of graphene is reduced compared to its value 340 N/m
for “ideal” graphene (no disorder, zero temperature) by
a large factor (up to ∼ 40) at low stretching. When tem-
perature was lowered down to 10 K, the stiﬀness showed
a sizeable increase, still remaining much smaller than 340
N/m. These data are in agreement with our conclusion
that ripples and ﬂexural phonons strongly weaken the
in-plane stiﬀness, yielding comparable contributions at
room temperature. The range of stretchings where the
eﬀect was observed (below 1%) is also in a good agree-
ment with our above estimates for ξ∗ − ξB and ξ∗ − ξT .
Some devices showed a strong non-linearity. In particu-
lar, using data of Fig. 2c of Ref. [13], we estimate the
exponent of the anomalous Hooke’s law as α ∼ 0.3, in
good agreement with our predictions. It is not clear to us
why only a subset of samples studied in Ref.[13] showed
such non-linearity.

Our results are also in good agreement with numerical
simulations of Ref. [44] which were performed for clean
graphene.
In particular, the ﬁrst line of our Eq. (31)
is in agreement with the large-sample data in Fig. 4 of
Ref. [44] displaying the dependence of the eﬀective Young
modulus on strain.

To conclude, the theory of anomalous Hooke’s law was
developed, both for clean and disordered graphene. In
both cases, scaling of the deformation with the external
force obeys a fractal power law even in the limit of an in-
ﬁnitesimally weak force, see Eqs. (17), (18) for the clean
case and Eqs. (25), (26) for the disordered case. This

The phase diagram in the plane of parameters (κ, B)
(bending rigitidy and disorder) is shown in Fig. 2.
It
is seen that the eﬀect of tension is twofold. First, it
shifts the line separating the ﬂat and crumpled phases;
this shift is characterized by δκcr and δBcr. Second,
the tension splits the ﬂat phase into two phases. The
border between these phases can be found by using the
fact that fcr is numerically large. Hence, for q ≫ qσ,
one can use the large-f asymptotic of the RG equation
for f . Solving this equation, we arrive at the conclu-
sion that the border is given by the line f = f0 = const,
where f0 = fcr + (3/4) ln (q∗/qσ), with q∗ and qσ given
by Eqs. (21) and (23), respectively.

Let us now apply these results to graphene (D = 2,
dc = 1) and compare our ﬁndings with recent experi-
mental results and numerical simulations.
In Ref. [42]
we estimated the amplitude of the static disorder as
b = 0.03 based on experimental measurements of pa-
rameters of ripples [48]. Taking bare value of the bend-
ing rigidity for graphene, κ ≃ 1 eV, we ﬁnd f ≃ 1 at
room temperature. This implies that at T ≃ 300 K dy-
namical ﬂuctuations and ripples have comparable ampli-
tudes. At low temperatures, T ≪ 300 K, ripples dom-
inate elastic properties of graphene. For b = 0.03
Estimating µ ∼ 1 eV/˚A2, we
we get B ≃ 5 · 10−3.
ﬁnd from Eq. (27) the crossover values of the tension,
σ∗ ≃ 5 · 10−3 eV/˚A2, and the corresponding stretching,
ξ∗ − ξB ≃ 5 · 10−3. For strain below these values, we get
from Eq. (25) the anomalous Hooke’s law ξ − ξT ∝ σα

behavior of the elastic modulus is dominated by thermal
ﬂuctuations for clean graphene, while for strongly disor-
dered graphene the main contribution comes from static
transverse deformations—ripples. Remarkably, the same
coupling between longitudinal and transverse modes that
enhances the bending rigiditiy, thus rescuing the ﬂat
phase of the membrane, simultaneously leads to a dra-
matic softening of the in-plane elasticity.

Derivation of the free energy of the clean membrane

with nonzero tension

We start with Eq. (2) of the main text for the elastic
energy (in the absence of disorder, β = 0) and rewrite it
as follows

E =

L2(µ + λ)

2

"(cid:18)ξ2 − 1 +

K

2 (cid:19)2

K 2

4 # + E0(˜u, h),

where

K =Z d2x

L2 ∂αh∂αh

(S.1)

(S.2)

and E0(˜u, h) is given by Eq. (3) of the main text. Next,
we calculate the free energy F from the partition function
Z that is written as a functional integral over ﬂuctuations
˜u, h :

F = −T ln Z,
Z = Z e−E/T{d˜udh}.

(S.3)

(S.4)

As a ﬁrst step, one can integrate out the in-plane
modes ˜u, thus obtaining the energy functional that de-
pends on h ﬁelds only [30, 42]. The interaction be-
tween these ﬁelds is described by the quartic term
Rq(k, k′)(hk+qh−k)(h−k′−qhk′ ) (the explicit form of
Rq(k, k′) can be found in Refs. [30, 42]). This interaction
can be taken into account within the RPA approach. It is
screened by polarization bubbles and leads to the renor-
malization of the bending rigidity: κ → κq. The term
with q = 0 (zero-mode) needs special attention.

There are two zero-mode contributions: the term

[see Eq. (2)], and the term with q = 0 coming from the
h4-terms in E0(˜u, h):

EZM =

× (h−QhQ)(h−Q′ hQ′).

Q2Q′2

(cid:21)

(S.7)

One can calculate the “Hartree” and “Fock” contribu-
tions to the self-energy coming from the functional (S.7).
The Hartree contribution vanishes after averaging over
the angle between Q and Q′. The Fock contribution
comes from Q = Q′ and hence survives the angular av-
eraging. The lowest-order Fock correction to the self-
energy is momentum-independent, but is inversely pro-
∗/L2, thus van-
portional to the system size: Σ ∝ κq2
ishing in the thermodynamic limit. Taking screening
into account leads to a further suppression of the Fock
self-energy. Indeed, the inverse polarization operator in-
creases with decreasing q : Π−1
q ∝ q2 [see Eq. (38) of
Ref. [42]]. Since the interaction line in the zero-mode
terms carries zero momentum, we take polarization op-
erator at q ∼ 1/L and ﬁnally obtain: Σ ∝ κ/L4. Thus,
the zero-mode interaction can be safely neglected. It is
worth noting that the key point of this derivation is the
cancellation of the Hartree contribution after the angu-
lar averaging. Indeed, one can check that each of the two
terms of the opposite sign in Eq. (S.7) yields a correc-
tion to self-energy in the Hartree channel which does not
depend on the system volume.

We are, therefore, left with the following eﬀective func-

Since the in-plane modes are integrated out, the partition
function, Eq. (S.4), contains now the integral over {dh}

does not contain the q = 0 term because the zero mode

gral in Eq. (S.9) yields

χ = χ0 = iσ,

where σ is related to ξ by Eq. (12) of the main text.
Calculating the integral over dχ, we ﬁnd the ξ-dependent
part of the free energy

F (ξ) = −iχ0L2ξ2 = σL2ξ2.

(S.12)

Diﬀerentiating this equation with respect to the pro-
jected area A = ξ2L2 yields Eq. (7) of the main text.
For σ 6= 0, the Green function of the out-of-plane modes
reads

given by the ratio of the bare disorder, b, and the bare
magnitude of dynamical (thermal) ﬂuctuations, T /κ.
Above we have neglected the anharmonic coupling, Erep
,
so that κ and b were q-independent.
In fact, the an-
harmonicity leads to a weak scale dependence of these
variables: κ → κq, b → bq. To ﬁnd this dependence, we
calculate the anharmonicity-induced self-energy ˆΣq and
ﬁnd the dressed Green function

RPA), its elements read [42]

(S.29)
The upper (q ≫ qσ) asymptotics in Eq. (S.29) has been
obtained previously in Ref. [42]. We assume that q ≪ q∗
(relation between q and qσ can be arbitrary), where the
Ginzburg scale q∗ is modiﬁed by disorder [42]:

q∗ ∼(cid:20) µT (1 + 2f )

(S.30)

It is worth noting that for strong disorder or low temper-

9

atures (f ≫ 1) q∗ ∼ (µb/κ)1/2 is independent of temper-
ature, while for weak disorder (f ≪ 1) , q∗ ∝ T 1/2. For
such q, matrix elements of the self-energy in the replica
space read

(S.31)

Substituting here the bare Green function, Eq. (S.22),
we ﬁnd by simple power-counting that the corresponding
integral diverges as k4 ln k both for k > qσ and k < qσ.
This implies that RG equations can be written in terms
of the renormalization of ˆκ. Separating in thus obtained
equation terms proportional to unity and to ˆJ, we arrive
to Eqs. (22) and (28) of the main text.
