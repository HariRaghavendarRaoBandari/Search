A THIRD-MOMENT THEOREM AND PRECISE ASYMPTOTICS
FOR VARIATIONS OF STATIONARY GAUSSIAN SEQUENCES

L´EO NEUFCOURT AND FREDERI G. VIENS

Abstract. In two new papers (Bierm´e et al., 2013) and (Nourdin and Peccati,
2015), sharp general quantitative bounds are given to complement the well-
known fourth moment theorem of Nualart and Peccati, by which a sequence
in a ﬁxed Wiener chaos converges to a normal law if and only if its fourth
cumulant converges to 0. The bounds show that the speed of convergence is
precisely of order the maximum of the fourth cumulant and the absolute value
of the third moment (cumulant). Specializing to the case of normalized cen-
tered quadratic variations for stationary Gaussian sequences, we show that a
third moment theorem holds: convergence occurs if and only if the sequence’s
third moments tend to 0. This is proved for sequences with general decreasing
covariance, by using the result of (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015), and ﬁnding the
exact speed of convergence to 0 of the quadratic variation’s third and fourth
cumulants. (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015) also allows us to derive quantitative
estimates for the speeds of convergence in a class of log-modulated covariance
structures, which puts in perspective the notion of critical Hurst parameter
when studying the convergence of fractional Brownian motion’s quadratic vari-
ation. We also study the speed of convergence when the limit is not Gaussian
but rather a second-Wiener-chaos law. Using a log-modulated class of spectral
densities, we recover a classical result of Dobrushin-Major/Taqqu whereby the
limit is a Rosenblatt law, and we provide new convergence speeds. The con-
clusion in this case is that the price to pay to obtain a Rosenblatt limit despite
a slowly varying modulation is a very slow convergence speed, roughly of the
same order as the modulation.

1. Introduction

We are inspired by the following reformulation of Theorem 1.2 in (Nourdin and

Peccati, 2015), which is itself based on ideas contained in (Bierm´e et al., 2013).

Theorem 1.1 (4th moment theorem in total variation and convergence rates).
If (Fn)n≥0 is a sequence in a ﬁxed Wiener chaos (e.g. in the second chaos), and
V ar [Fn] = 1, then (Fn)n≥0 converges in law towards N (0, 1) if and only if E[F 4
n] →
3 = E[N 4], where N ∼ N (0, 1). Moreover the convergence rate in this case is
n](cid:12)(cid:12)), in the sense of commensurability for the total
Mn := max(E[F 4
variation metric dT V (Fn, N ) ≍ Mn, i.e.

n] − 3,(cid:12)(cid:12)E[F 3

∃c, C > 0 : cMn ≤ dT V (Fn, N ) ≤ CMn.

(1.1)

of the form CpE[F 4

The ﬁrst part of this theorem is known as the 4th moment theorem, proved
originally by Nualart and Peccati in (Nualart and Peccati, 2005). The second
part, i.e. relation (1.1), suggests that the third moment is just as important as
the 4th moment when investigating the normal convergence of sequences in a ﬁxed
Wiener chaos. Theorem 1.1 also provides new information about a rather successful
estimate for evaluating normal convergence speeds, which was established thanks to
a research program started in 2008 by Nourdin and Peccati in (Nourdin and Peccati,
2009). Speciﬁcally, in (Nourdin and Reinert, 2010) an upper bound on dT V (Fn, N )
n] − 3 is established (see Theorem 5.2.6 in (Nourdin and Peccati,
2012)); Theorem 1.1 above shows that this estimate is not sharp in cases where the
third moment is dominated by the 4th moment minus 3 (a.k.a. the 4th cumulant
κ4 (Fn)), and in the other cases, leaves the question of sharpness of past results to a
comparison with the third moment. Such a discovery begs the question of how much
one might improve certain convergence results, e.g. of Berry-Ess´een type, by using
Theorem 1.1 instead of Theorem 5.2.6 in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2012). The authors
of (Nourdin and Peccati, 2012) joined forces with Bierm´e and Bonami to produce
the ﬁrst positive result in this direction, in (Bierm´e et al., 2013): they worked with
a weaker notion of convergence than total-variation convergence, but were able to
show, in the case of the power variations of discrete fractional Brownian motion,
that the third moment seems to dominate the 4th cumulant in many cases, and
therefore determines normal convergence in those cases, yielding much improved
speeds as a consequence.
In (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015), Nourdin and Peccati
improve this result by showing that it holds for the total variation distance, thanks
to the general Theorem 1.1.

Herein, we too base our analysis on the power aﬀorded by Theorem 1.1, and
focus our attention on broadening the study of quadratic variations from (Bierm´e
et al., 2013), to include general stationary Gaussian sequences with no reference to
H¨older-continuity or self-similarity.

In addition to what is described above, our motivation is to show that, in the case
of quadratic variations (which live in the 2nd chaos) the fourth moment theorem can
be replaced by a third moment theorem, with corresponding quantitative estimates
of the total variation distance and of the relation between the 3rd and 4th moments.
Another motivation is to keep our analysis as general as possible within the conﬁnes
of variations of stationary Gaussian sequences, with as little assumptions about
their covariance structure as we can.

In other words, we consider a sequence of centered identically distributed Gauss-
ian random variables (Xn)n∈Z for which there exists a function ρ on Z such that

A THIRD-MOMENT THEOREM

for all integers k, n, E [XnXn+k] = ρ (k). We only assume that ρ is of constant sign,
and |ρ| decreases near +∞. Note that ρ is necessarily symmetric (even) and of pos-
itive type (meaning that (ρ (k − ℓ))k,ℓ is a non-negative deﬁnite matrix). Without
loss of generality, we assume that V ar [Xn] = ρ (0) = 1 throughout. We deﬁne the
normalized centered quadratic variation

Fn :=

Vn√vn

,

k=0 (X 2

k − 1), and vn := E[V 2

where Vn := 1√nPn−1
n ]. We prove the equivalence of
third and fourth moment theorems for the limit of Fn under this general framework
(Theorem 3.2 on page 8).
The presence of the “normalizing” term 1/√n in the deﬁnition of Vn is not
needed (Theorem 3.2 remains valid without it); it is a convention that comes from
working with sequences where vn is bounded, so that the normalization of the
discrete centered quadratic variation Pn−1
k − 1) needed to obtain a normal
limit is 1/√n, as one would hope for in a straightforward generalization of the
central limit theorem. This situation is the well-known framework for the classical
Breuer-Major central limit theorem (see (Breuer and Major, 2011) or Theorem 7.2.4
in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2012)). Some might argue that the interesting cases are
those for which vn tends to inﬁnity. See step 2 in the proof of Proposition 4.1 in
Section 4 for a class of log-modulated models where the transition from bounded
to unbounded vn occurs, i.e. where the Breuer-Major statement becomes invalid.
Generally speaking, we argue that this type of “phase transition” is an artefact of
the model class one uses.

k=0 (X 2

We investigate this question of phase transitions in the Berry-Ess´een rates for the
Breuer-Major central limit theorem, i.e. the rate at which dT V (Fn, N ) converges
to 0. In the case of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn, for which ρ (k) is equivalent to
H (2H − 1)|k|2H−2 for large |k|), up until very recently, the rate of convergence of
dT V (Fn, N ) to 0 was known to be the classical Berry-Ess´een rate 1/√n only for
H < 5/8. Thanks to the results in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015) and (Bierm´e et al.,
2013), it is now known that this rate hold up to H < 2/3. The optimal rates for
fBm are even known, as can be seen in (Bierm´e et al., 2013) (also see Proposition
4.3 in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015)): the rate 1/√n is optimal for H < 2/3; then
for H = 2/3, the optimal rate is n−1/2 log2 n, whereas for H ∈ (2/3, 3/4), the
optimal rate is n6H−9/2. Therefore, speaking strictly about the fGn scale, this can
be interpreted as a “phase transition”, or a critical threshold H = 2/3. We argue
that for general sequences, insofar as optimal rates are given by (1.1) in Theorem 1.1
if they can be computed, the notion of critical threshold is model-class-dependent.
Herein, we show that the so-called critical threshold above can be investigated
in more detail, to reveal a range of possibilities for the convergence rate at the
Berry-Ess´een critical threshold H = 2/3, for a class of covariance functions with
log-modulation. Our tools also enable us to compute rates for situations which were
left out in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015) and (Bierm´e et al., 2013): a second critical
threshold at H = 3/4 reveals another range of possibilities under our log-modulated
class where normal convergence holds. This subclass of models with “H = 3/4”
contains models for which the Breuer-Major theorem holds, and others for which
it does not. When normal convergence holds but the classical Breuer-Major nor-
malization fails, we ﬁnd very slow rates of convergence: rate log− 3
2 (n) in all cases

4

except one exceptional model which beneﬁts from a log(log(n))− 3
2 correction. For
fGn, which is a special case of our results, we provide a slight improvement on the
only result we are aware of (Corollary 7.4.3 in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2012)) which
deals with the case “H = 3/4”: scaled quadratic variations for fGn with H = 3/4
have a speed of normal convergence of order log−1 (n). All our results mentioned
above are sharp, and are given in Proposition 4.1 on page 11.

Both this class of examples, given in Section 4, and our generic third moment
theorem given in Section 3, are based on a precise asymptotic expression for the
third moment of Fn, and a precise upper bound for the fourth moment of Fn, both
given for general ρ, in Theorem 2.4 in Section 2. This intrinsic study shows that
there is nothing special about the power rate of correlation decay when investigating
central limit theorems for quadratic variations. We also note that we are able to
develop a general third-moment theorem without needing a direct estimation of the
fourth cumulant κ4 (Fn), giving more credence to the claim that the third moment
theorem is the right tool for studying centered quadratic variations.

The key to this surprising shortcut is Proposition 3.1, which shows that one can
bound the third moment κ3 (Fn) below by n1/4κ4 (Fn)3/4. This implies that κ3 (Fn)
is always the dominant term in the exact rate of convergence of dT V (Fn, N ) to zero,
showing in particular that if κ3 (Fn) → 0 then κ4 (Fn) → 0, which is suﬃcient to
conclude that Fn → N . This in turn implies the exact total-variation convergence
rate (1.1) from Theorem 1.1. The converse statement, that κ4 (Fn) → 0 implies
κ3 (Fn) → 0, follows immediately from Theorem 1.1.
The remainder of the paper after Section 4 deals with what happens when no
normal convergence holds, i.e. when none of the equivalent conditions in Theorem
3.2 hold. Here, as is typical for studies of non-normal convergence on Wiener space,
the Malliavin calculus-based tools such as Theorem 1.1 are no longer useful. In such
cases one may expect that normalized centered quadratic variations of stationary
Gaussian sequences will converge in distribution towards second-chaos laws.

The classical result in this direction is a special case of what is often known as the
Dobrushin-Major–Taqqu theorem. This theorem refers to two separate results from
1979 on non-linear functionals of fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In the special
case of centered quadratic variations, Taqqu ((Taqqu, 1979)) implies a convergence
in the mean-square for the normalized centered quadratic variations of fBm on
[0, 1], towards the law of a Rosenblatt r.v. F∞. On the other hand Dobrushin
and Major ((Dobrushin and Major, 2011)) prove convergence to the same law, but
only in law, not in the mean-square, for the increments of fBm over intervals of
length 1, as the horizon increases. This second setting is the same as the one we
use here: the increments of fBm on unit intervals are known as fractional Gaussian
noise (fGn), and as mentioned above, fGn is the canonical power-scale example of a
stationary Gaussian sequence with unit variance. The self-similarity of fBm implies
that Taqqu’s result and Dobrushin and Major’s result are equivalent in the setting
we have chosen here, i.e. stationary Gaussian sequences. For the historical reasons
given above, it is legitimate to refer to such a result as a Dobrushin-Major theorem.
Herein, we investigate the question of speed of convergence in the Dobrushin-
Major theorem. As we said, results of the type of Theorem 1.1 are of no use here,
since the convergence we seek is of second-chaos type, not normal.
Instead, as
in (Breton and Nourdin, 2008), we refer to a result of Davydov and Martinova
(Davydov and Martynova, 1987), which enables one to compare the total-variation

A THIRD-MOMENT THEOREM

distance of two chaos variables with the square-root of their diﬀerence’s L2 norm.
This requires the use of a change of probability space, which is why the conver-
gence cannot hold in L2 (Ω). In the spirit of Dobrushin and Major, we consider
the spectral representation of the stationary Gaussian sequence, and obtain ﬁrst a
general strategy for estimating the speed of convergence for sequences whose spec-
tral density has a certain type of functional asymptotic behavior under dilation of
the Fourier space’s unit circle (Section 5). Then we specialize to cases where the
spectral density is a power times a slowly-varying function, in order to present re-
sults similar to those for our log-modulated class of examples. Our computational
technique must go beyond the calculations in (Breton and Nourdin, 2008), since
the limit we obtain is the same for all log-modulated processes for a ﬁxed H, and
therefore no self-similarity arguments may be used. Our results in Section 6 show
that the speed of convergence itself does not depend on the modulation parameter:

(Theorem 2 on page 18).

for modulations of the form logβ |x|, dT V (Fn, F∞) = O(cid:0)log−2 n(cid:1), for any β > 0

We do not know if this result is sharp, but it does provide a sobering extension
to known speed-of-convergence results in the Dobrushin-Major theorem, as com-
pared for instance with the case β = 0, where we get the much faster power rate

dT V (Fn, F∞) = O(cid:0)n3/4−H(cid:1) (see Theorem 7.4.5 in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2012)).

One can interpret our result as saying that the price to pay for a mild “universality”
result whereby a slowly-varying perturbation of fGn still leads to a Rosenblatt limit
in law, is that the speed of convergence will be roughly as slow as the perturbation.
Summarizing the descriptions above, the remainder of this paper is structured as
follows. In Section 2 we ﬁnd sharp estimates of the variance, third, and fourth cu-
mulants of the normalized centered quadratic variation Fn. We use these in Section
3 to prove a third-moment theorem for normal convergence, with precise speed of
convergence, for general stationary Gaussian sequences (Theorem 3.2). In Section
4, we apply this theorem to a class of log-modulated covariance structures, identi-
fying a number of critical cases in the convergence rates (Proposition 4.1), which
go beyond the phase transitions recently identiﬁed for fGn in (Bierm´e et al., 2013).
In Section 5, we deﬁne a strategy for estimating speeds of non-normal convergence
for general Fn, based on a classical estimate in (Davydov and Martynova, 1987)
and spectral representation of stationary sequences (Corollary 1). In Section 6, we
apply this strategy for sequences with power spectral density and log modulation,
proving that compared to the fGn case with H > 3/4, the speed deteriorates to
log−2 n instead of n3/4−H (Theorem 2).

2. Estimates for the second, third, and fourth cumulants

In this section we get precise estimates for the variance and the 3rd and 4th
cumulants of Fn. Let us deﬁne ﬁrst the comparison relations that are used in what
follows.

Deﬁnition 2.1 (Comparison relations). Given two deterministic numeric sequences
(an)n≥0 , (bn)n≥0 in a metric space, we use the following notations and deﬁnitions
for respectively domination, commensurability, equivalence:
an = O (bn) ⇐⇒ ∃C > 0 : an ≤ Cbn for n large enough
an ≍ bn ⇐⇒ ∃c, C > 0 : cbn ≤ an ≤ Cbn for n large enough
an ∼ bn ⇐⇒ ∃cn, Cn > 0 : limn→∞ cn = limn→∞ Cn = 1 and cnbn ≤ an ≤ Cnbn

for n large enough.

6

Remark 2.2. O is an order relation, while ≍ and ∼ are equivalence relations. More-
over, an≍bn is equivalent to {an = O (bn) and bn = O (an)}.
Remark 2.3. The quantities κ3(Fn) := E(F 3
n] − 3 are called
the 3rd and 4th cumulants of Fn. That κ3(Fn) coincides with the third moment
is because Fn is centered. Moreover, κ4(Fn) is strictly positive because Fn is a
non-Gaussian chaos r.v. (see (Nourdin and Peccati, 2012, Appendix A) for details
on cumulants on Wiener chaos).

This proposition leads to the following.

Let (Fn)n≥0, (vn)n≥0,and ρ be as in Theorem 2.4. Denote N ∼ N (0, 1). Then the
following four statements are equivalent:

(i): (Fn)n≥0 converges in law towards N (0, 1);

Proof :

By the 4th moment theorem (non-quantitative statement in Theorem 1.1), (i)
and (iii) are equivalent. By the commensurability relation (2.1) in Theorem 2.4,
(ii) and (iv) are equivalent. For the ﬁrst statement of the theorem, it is now
enough to show (ii) and (iii) are equivalent. By Proposition 3.1, we have κ4(Fn) =

On the other hand, if (iii) holds, by Theorem 1.1, the convergence in (i) holds in total
variation, and the theorem’s lower bound in (1.1) implies (ii). The second statement

of the theorem follows from (1.1) and the estimate κ4 (Fn) = O(cid:16)n−1/3 |κ3 (Fn)|4/3(cid:17)
which shows that κ4 (Fn) = o (|κ3 (Fn)|). The third statement combines relations
(2.1) and (2.3) in Theorem 2.4. The theorem is proved.

The following result can be useful when dealing with non-normal convergence.

Corollary 3.3. If ρ /∈ ℓ2 (Z) then vn ∼ 2Pn−1

We use the notation and estimates from Step 4 in the proof of Theorem 2.4.
Since U (n) ≍ nT (n), we have that U (n) ≍ n iﬀ T (n) converges, i.e. ρ ∈ ℓ2 (Z).
Therefore if ρ /∈ ℓ2 (Z) (i.e. T (n) → ∞), then since U (n) ≥ (n/2) T (n/2) ≫ n, we
can ignore the ﬁrst term in the equivalent (2.3), proving the asymptotic equivalent
of the corollary.

The case of S (n) bounded is trivial, so we assume S (n) is unbounded. For any

To prove the corollary’s second statement, by Theorem 3.2, it is suﬃcient to
show that ρ ∈ ℓ2 (Z) implies condition (iv) of the theorem. Since ρ ∈ ℓ2 (Z) implies
that vn is bounded, we only need to show that S (n) :=P|k|<n |ρ(k)|3/2 = o(cid:0)n1/4(cid:1).

S (n1) is ﬁxed, and S (n) diverges, there exists n2 > n1 such that for all n ≥ n2,
S (n) ≥ 2S (n1). Hence we have

S (n) = S (n) − S (n1) + S (n1) ≤ S (n) − S (n1) + 2−1S (n)

4. Example: sequences with log–modulated power covariance

Assume here that the correlation function ρ satisﬁes
|ρ(n)| ∼ n2H−2 log2β(n),

(4.1)
for large n, with H ∈ [0, 1] and β ∈ R. A stationary sequence (Xn)n∈Z with this
property can easily be constructed as a Gaussian Fourier integral

Xn =ZS1pq (x) cos (xn) W (dx) +ZS1pq (x) sin (xn) ˜W (dx)

with Fourier coeﬃcients q (x) = x1−2H log−2β(x−1), where x is the Fourier param-
eter on the unit circle S1, and W and ˜W are independent white noises on S1. The
details are omitted here; some can be found in the Appendix (see Section 7.1). We
also assume, as in the past, that ρ is of constant sign and |ρ| decreases for large
n. The process constructed above by Gaussian Fourier integral satisﬁes this as-
sumption. A arbitrary constant scaling factor should be added to the asymptotics
of |ρ| (like the H |2H − 1| for fBm), but we omit this in this section for notational
simplicity.
The case of discrete-time fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), treated in (Nourdin
and Peccati, 2015) and (Bierm´e et al., 2013), falls within the special case of H ∈
(0, 3/4) and β = 0. An extension of the fGn is developed in (Bierm´e et al., 2011)
contains a correction term added to the the power spectral density of fractional
Brownian motion, which decays like a faster power at high frequency. This means
that the additional term is treated like a lower-order remainder, for continuous-time
data. Strictly speaking, this type of model is not immediately comparable to the
discrete-time models we consider here. However, a similar study for discrete time
could be done, for instance, on correlation structures of the form |ρ(n)| ∼ n2H−2 +
r (n) where the remainder r (n) = O(cid:0)n2H−2−γ(cid:1) for some γ > 0. Such a class
is contained in our assumption (4.1) with β = 0; the corresponding convergence
results and speeds of convergence would then depend only on H, not γ. We omit
any further discussion of this point for the sake of brevity.

We will see below in Proposition 4.1, that we can cover the case H = 3/4 for any
β, and that within the two presumed “critical thresholds” H = 2/3 and H = 3/4,
there arise further “critical log-thresholds” β = −1/3 and β = −1/4 respectively;
moreover, the thresholds H = 2/3 and H = 3/4 only give rise to “exotic” con-
vergence rates (i.e. with “log corrections”) for certain ranges of the parameter
β. In this sense, the notion of critical value or of phase transition is model-class-
dependent. The reader could further convince herself of this by considering a class
of processes with H = 2/3, β = −1/3, and an additional factor log log2γ (n), to
ﬁnd out that the “critical pair” (H = 2/3, β = −1/3) which we exhibit harbors fur-
ther ranges and cutoﬀ values of the parameter γ, some of which may be considered
more exotic than others. In other words, the so-called critical cases do not have any
fundamental signiﬁcance, but just appear as consequences of the models’ scaling
choices (power-scale in the fractional Brownian example, log+power-scale in our
class of examples).

Also notice that by Proposition 3.1, the asymptotics of dT V (Fn, N ) are always
given by those of κ3 (Fn), even when the Breuer-Major theorem fails. This is not a
robust result, however. For instance, one can check from the calculations in (Bierm´e
et al., 2013) and (Nourdin and Peccati, 2015) that for q ≥ 3 and certain values of H,

A THIRD-MOMENT THEOREM

the third and fourth cumulants take turns at determining the speed of convergence
of qth-power variations of fBm. As soon as the limit of Fn is not normal, the
question of determining an optimal speed of convergence for Fn becomes unresolved.
It is known that for fBm and other self-similar processes, when H > 3/4, the
normalized quadratic variation converges to a so-called Rosenblatt distribution,
which is a law in the second chaos, which depends on the parameter H (see (Tudor
and Viens, 2009) and references therein). Estimating the rate of this convergence
from above, for fBm and for log-modulated processes, is the topic of Sections 5
and 6; therein we will see that unlike the case of normal convergence, the rate is
determined by the modulation rather than H.

Returning to the topic of normal convergence of Fn, under the asymptotics in
(4.1) we now compute the equivalents of the convergence rates exactly, thanks to
Theorem 2.4. Let us recall the following well-known result about Bertrand series.

Property 1 (Equivalents of Bertrand series). The series Sn(α, β) :=Pn>0 nα logβ(n)
converges if and only if α < −1 or α = −1 and β < −1. When the series diverges,
we have the following equivalents for its partial sum:

• Sn(−1,−1) ∼ log(log(n));
• Sn(−1, β) ∼ 1
• Sn(α, β) ∼ 1

β+1 logβ+1(n) if β > −1;
α+1 nα+1 logβ(n) if α > −1, β > −1.

We may now use this lemma and Theorem 2.4 to obtain the asymptotic order
of the third and fourth cumulants, which gives us the rate of convergence to the
normal law for (Fn), as a consequence of Theorem 3.2.

Proposition 4.1. With the notation and assumptions as in Theorem 3.2, there
are positive constants c, C such that cMn ≤ dT V (Fn, N ) ≤ CMn where

All the computations below are based on the sharp estimates of Theorem 2.4.
By Theorem 3.2, it is suﬃcient to compute a commensurable equivalent of κ3(Fn).

Step 1: computing the series P|k|<n ρ(k)3/2.
Using our class of examples for ρ, we have thatP|k|<n ρ(k)3/2 diverges if and only
if P|k|<n |k|3(H−1) log3β(|k|) diverges, and is equivalent to this divergent partial
sum in that case. Therefore, by the equivalents for Bertrand series, P|k|<n ρ(k)3/2

is equivalent to

5. Strategy for non-normal convergence

In Theorem 3.2, we saw that (Fn)n≥0 converges to a normal if and only if Con-
dition (iv) therein is satisﬁed. When this condition does not hold, one may wonder
what kind of other convergence we could get. The celebrated theorem of Dobrushin-
Major and Taqqu (Dobrushin and Major, 2011; Taqqu, 1979) spells out the possi-
ble second-chaos limits of (Fn)n≥0 which occur for slowly-varying perturbations of
fGn. In this section, we detail a general methodology, based on the context used by
Dobrushin and Major, to determine whether convergence to a second-chaos limit
holds.

We are not able to provide general criteria as sharp and as explicit as those which
we gave in the previous section for normal convergence; we are not aware of any

A THIRD-MOMENT THEOREM

13

such works in the literature. However, a classical result of Davydov and Martinova
(Davydov and Martynova, 1987) enables us to deﬁne a strategy for establishing
speed of convergence in total variation to second-chaos limits. Section 6 shows how
to apply this methodology when the slowly-varying terms are logarithmic, similarly
to the class of examples presented in Section 4.

It was recently established in (Nourdin and Poly, 2012) that the only limits in
distribution for sequences in a 2nd Wiener chaos are of the form L (N + F ) where
F and N are independent and F is the law of a second-chaos rv, and N is Gaussian.
It is conceivable that one could ﬁnd a choice of law for our sequence X such that
(Fn)n≥0 converges in law to such a convolution. We will avoid such a situation,
and investigate how to prove instead that (Fn)n≥0 converges in law to the law of a
second-chaos random variable.
As in (Taqqu, 1979), we can express our stationary sequence X as a Fourier
integral over the unit circle S1 ≡ [−π, π). Let q be the Fourier transform of the
even sequence ρ on Z, deﬁned on S1 by

q (x) := Xn∈Z

ρ (n) cos (nx) .

Assume that q ∈ L1(cid:0)S1(cid:1). It is known that q is non-negative, with RS 1 q (x) dx =
ρ (0) = 1. Since we are interested in sequences X such that (Fn)n≥0 does not
converge to a normal, we will ﬁnd that typically we have a long memory property,
i.e. ρ /∈ ℓ1 (Z), so that the Fourier series deﬁning q is not absolutely convergent.
In fact, for ρ decreasing, we saw in Corollary 3.3 that ρ is not even in ℓ2 (Z).
However, if q ∈ L1(cid:0)S1(cid:1) is given exogenously, the classical theorem on pointwise
diﬀerentiable. The assumption q ∈ L1(cid:0)S1(cid:1) and its diﬀerentiability will be veriﬁed
in our examples in Section 6. We will also need to ensure that ρ satisﬁes a Fourier
inversion theorem. Since ρ /∈ ℓ1 (Z), we cannot appeal directly to the classical
Fourier inversion theorem, and we must thus check that it holds on a case-by-case
basis. In Section 6, we will work with covariances ρ which are deﬁned in terms of
their Fourier transform q, so that Fourier inversion is automatic.

convergence of Fourier series (see (Stein and Shakarchi, 2003) Chapter 3, Theorem
2.1) implies that the Fourier series of q converges to q at all points where q is

With q ∈ L1(cid:0)S1(cid:1) as above, and assuming that Fourier inversion holds for ρ,

then as for instance in Dobrushin (Dobrushin, 1979), the following spectral repre-
sentation holds for the centered Gaussian sequence X whose covariance is ρ: there
exists a standard complex-valued white noise W on S1 such that

X(k) =ZS 1

eikxpq(x)W (dx).

(5.1)

This appellation for W means that for x ∈ [0, π], W (dx) = B1 (dx) + iB2 (dx),
where B1 and B2 are two real-valued independent white noise measures on [0, π]
with scaling constant (2π)−1/2 (i.e. V ar[Bi([0, π])] = 1/2), and for every x ∈
[0, π], W (−dx) = W (dx) = B1 (dx) − iB2 (dx). It is helpful to realize that the
representation (5.1) is equivalent to

X (k) =Z π

−πpq (x) cos (kx) W1 (dx) +Z π

−πpq (x) sin (kx) W2 (dx)

where W1 and W2 are i.i.d. real-valued white noises on [−π, π], standardized so that
V ar (Wi [−π, π]) = 1. Details on the properties of W are given in the Appendix in

Section 7.1. In the remainder of this section and in Section 6, it will be suﬃcient
for us to know the following special case of the isometry formula for double Wiener

integrals with respect to W : for f ∈ L2(cid:16)(cid:0)S1(cid:1)2

(5.2)

See Section 7.1 for a proof. Note in addition that the isometry formula (5.2) for
double Wiener integrals against a complex-valued white noise does not contain the
usual factor of 2 associated with the isometry property for double Wiener integrals
with respect to a real-valued white noise.

From formula (5.1) and the product formula for Wiener integrals, we can write

X (k)2 − 1 =ZZ(S 1)2

W (dx) W (dy) eik(x+y)pq (x) q (y).

Using the stochastic Fubini theorem, justiﬁed because q ∈ L1(cid:0)S1(cid:1) implies that
(k, x, y) 7→ eik(x+y)pq (x) q (y) is in L2(cid:16)(cid:0)S1(cid:1)2(cid:17) × ℓ2 (Z), we get

To prove that (Fn)n≥0 converges in law to a second-chaos distribution, it is suﬃ-
cient to prove that there exists a Wiener space(cid:16) ˆΩ, ˆF, ˆP(cid:17) such that for every n there

Furthermore, since d (F∞, Fn) = d(cid:16)F∞, ˆFn(cid:17) for any distance d on the set of laws,
to estimate the total-variation distance between the law of F∞ and the law of Fn,
one may rely on a theorem of Davydov and Martinova (Davydov and Martynova,
1987), by which, if indeed (cid:16) ˆFn(cid:17)n>0

converges in L2 (Ω) to F∞, then

dT V (cid:16) ˆFn, F∞(cid:17) ≤ cF∞(cid:18)ˆE(cid:20)(cid:16) ˆFn − F∞(cid:17)2(cid:21)(cid:19)1/4

(5.3)

where cF∞ is a ﬁnite constant depending only on the law of F∞.
We now change variables from (x, y) to (x′, y′) := (xn, yn), omitting the primes
for parsimony of notation, and we write In := [−πn, πn) for the corresponding
scaled circle. The self-similarity of W (dx) with index 1/2 means that W (cid:0)n−1dx(cid:1)
has the same law as n−1/2W (dx). Therefore the random variable Fn has the same
law as the variable ˆFn deﬁned as follows under a standard complex-valued white
noise measure ˆW on R scaled by (2π)−1/2 (in particular(cid:16) ˆΩ, ˆF , ˆP(cid:17) is the C-valued

15

We note that gn : x 7→ (1/n)(cid:0)eix − 1(cid:1) /(cid:0)einx − 1(cid:1) converges pointwise and
boundedly to the bounded function g : x 7→(cid:0)eix − 1(cid:1) / (ix), including at x = 0; this
is proved using elementary calculations and the inequality (cid:12)(cid:12)eix − 1 − ix(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ |x|2 for
|x| ≤ 1/2. This implies by dominated (bounded) convergence that gn and g can be
interchanged in expressions which are L2-convergent. We also recall that we may
use the expression nvn = −n + 2Pn−1
k=0 (n − k) ρ2 (k) which was established in (2.3)
Now using estimate (5.3) and the isometry property (5.2), the above discussion
proves the following criterion for convergence in law of ˆFn, which includes a possible
quantitative estimate. We emphasize that the convergence-in-law portion of this
strategy is not new, since it was used by Dobrushin and Major in the case of fGn
with slowly varying modulation.

The function g is bounded by 2h (x). Elementary calculations with n ≥ 3 and
x, y ∈ In lead to

6. Example: log-modulation and second-chaos limits

We have in mind the same class of examples as in Section 4. If H > 3

4 , one gets,
by relation (2.1) in Theorem 2.4, that κ3(Fn) converges to a non-zero constant.
Theorem 3.2 then proves that Fn cannot converge to a normal law. We now study
the possible convergence of Fn to non-normal laws.

In order to streamline the presentation, since our strategy is to use Corollary 1, it
turns out to be more convenient to make assumptions on q and derive corresponding
estimates on ρ and other quantities of interest. The reader may see below, by
comparing our deﬁnition of q in (6.1) and the estimate on ρ in Proposition 1, that
assumptions on q and ρ of log-modulated power type are asymptotically equivalent.
Let β ≥ 0 and H ∈ (3/4, 1). Consider the positive function q on the unit circle

S1 = [−π, π] deﬁned, except at x = 0, by

|x|(cid:19) .
q (x) := CH,β |x|1−2H log2β(cid:18) eπ
−π q (x) dx/ (2π) = 1, i.e.

The constant CH,β is chosen in such a way that R π

CH,β := 2π/Z π

−π |x|1−2H log2β(cid:18) eπ

|x|(cid:19) dx,

(6.1)

(6.2)

in order to stay with the assumption that our stationary sequence has unit variance,
but other normalizing constants pose no additional diﬃculty. The case β = 0
corresponds to fGn. The case β < 0 has slightly diﬀerent properties than the case
β ≥ 0, and requires further computations; we omit it for the sake of conciseness.
To simplify the notation, we introduce

L (y) := log2β (|y|)

and notice that L (eπ/ |x|) ≥ 1 for all x ∈ [−π, π]. Moreover, q is in L1(cid:0)S1, dx(cid:1)

and is C∞ everywhere except at 0, and therefore q coincides with the Fourier series
of its Fourier inverse ρ; in other words, the stationary Gaussian process X with
covariance function ρ given by

ρ (k) :=

1

2π Z π

−π

q (x) cos (kx) dx

(6.3)

has spectral density q. The relation (6.3), which is our deﬁnition of ρ, serves as the
Fourier inversion property required for applying Theorem 1 and its corollary. The

18

L´eo Neufcourt and Frederi G. Viens

other needed assumption is q ∈ L1(cid:0)S1(cid:1), which holds since H < 1. We recompute

ρ by changing variables and using the deﬁnition of q, to get

Here normalizations are such that ρ (0) = 1. The asymptotics of ρ are the following.

With Proposition 2 in hand, we can use Corollary 1 to establish a speed of

convergence result for the Dobrushin-Major theorem.

Theorem 2. Let (Fn)n≥0 be the sequence of normalized quadratic variations of a
centered stationary Gaussian sequence (Xn) with unit variance, i.e. Fn := Vn/√vn,
where Vn := n−1/2Pn−1
ℓ=0 ρ (k − ℓ)2,
with the covariance ρ of X given by (6.4). Assume H ∈ (3/4, 1) and β ≥ 0. Then
Fn converges in law to the law of a second-chaos variable F∞, and we have the
representation

total variation is bounded above as

dT V (Fn, F∞) ≤

where the positive constant c depends only on H and β.

Before concluding our article with the proof of this theorem, we rephrase the

result to match the usual normalizations found in the literature when H > 3/4.

Remark 4. According to Theorem 2, with (Xn) the correlated sequence of standard
normal random variables deﬁned therein, the sequence

where W is a complex-valued white noise on R with scale determined by |W (dx)|2 =
dx/ (2π) and CH,β is given in (6.2). The speed of convergence in total variation is
of order log−1/2 n for any β > 0 and any H ∈ (3/4, 1). When β = 0, this speed
can be improved to n3/4−H as can be seen in (Nourdin and Peccati, 2012, Theorem
7.4.5).

Proof of Theorem 2. Since, as mentioned above, q and ρ satisfy the assumptions of
Theorem 1, according to Corollary 1, and using its notation, it is suﬃcient to prove

that, with f (x, y) = |xy|H−1/2 /pK′H, the three terms in lines (5.4), (5.5), and
(5.6) all converge to 0 at least as fast as log−2 n. In all calculations below, it will
be convenient to change variables and replace y by −y; this only entails replacing
h (x + y) by h (x − y); all other expressions are invariant by this change of variables
since In and q are even and f is even in y; see Remark 2.
Step 1. We use Proposition 2 to handle the term in line (5.5). With γ = 2 − 2H,
this term is bounded above by a constant times

In order to use a uniform bound on the ﬁrst order Taylor expansion for this expres-
sion, we will ﬁx δ ∈ (0, 1) and consider u ∈ [−δ, 1]; then there is a positive ﬁnite

constant c = c (β, δ) such that for large n, (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

7.1. Representations of stationary Gaussian processes using the complex-
valued white noise measure. For the reader’s convenience, and for the sake of
being self-contained to some extent, we brieﬂy recall the construction and prop-
erties of the complex-valued white noise W . As indicated in Section 5, W is the
independently scattered C-valued centered Gaussian measure on S1 = [−π, π] such
that for x ∈ [0, π], W (dx) = B1 (dx) + iB2 (dx), where B1 and B2 are two real-
valued independent white noise measures on [0, π] such that V ar[Bi([0, π])] = 1/2,
and for every x ∈ [0, π], W (−dx) = W (dx) = B1 (dx) − iB2 (dx).

A THIRD-MOMENT THEOREM

23

This deﬁnition of W , where one notes that unlike in the real case, the restrictions
of W to [−π, 0] and to [0, π] are not independent, implies the following properties,
using the usual shorthand diﬀerential notation for Itˆo’s rule: for all x ∈ [0, π],
• ﬁrst Itˆo rule: W (dx) W (−dx) = W (dx) W (dx) = |W (dx)|2 = dx/ (2π) ,
• second Itˆo rule: W (dx) W (dx) = W (dx)2 = 0,
• W (dx) and W (dy) are independent for x 6= y and xy ≥ 0,
For X deﬁned as in (5.1) using a non-negative function q ∈ L1(cid:0)S1(cid:1), i.e.
k ∈ Z,

for

X(k) =ZS 1

eikxpq(x)W (dx),

we can rewrite this expression by expanding W according to its deﬁnition above:
for all k ∈ Z,

X (k) = 2Z π
= Z π

0 pq (x) cos (kx) B1 (dx) − 2Z π
−πpq (x) cos (kx) W1 (dx) +Z π

0 pq (x) sin (kx) B2 (dx) (7.1)
−πpq (x) sin (kx) W2 (dx)

(7.2)

where the second equality is in law, with W1 and W2 two independent real-valued
white noise measures on [−π, π] with scale determined by V ar [Wi ([−π, π])] = 1.
Representation (7.2) is more commonly found in the literature than Represen-
tation (7.1). From either representation, it is evident that X is real valued. From
(5.1), one can check that X has the announced covariance, as follows. Using the
fact that X is real-valued, and the product rule for Wiener integrals, we have
X (k) X (l) = X (k) X (l), which is the sum of a mean-zero second-chaos variable

and of a constant formally expressed as RS 1 eikxpq(x)W (dx)e−ilxpq(x) W (dx).

Thus, by Itˆo’s rule,

E [X (k) X (l)] =Z π

= ρ (k − l) ,

where the last equality assumes that Fourier inversion holds for ρ. We can extend
this type of calculation in general to express the isometry property in the second

chaos of the complex-valued W . For a function f ∈ L2(cid:0)[0, π]2, C(cid:1) we can write
I2 (f ) = ZZ[0,π]2

f (x, y) W (dx) W (dy) +ZZ[0,π]×[−π,0]

f (x, y) W (dx) W (dy)

+ZZ[−π,0]2

f (x, y) W (dx) W (dy) +ZZ[−π,0]×[0,π]

f (x, y) W (dx) W (dy)

f (x, y) W (dx) W (dy) +ZZ[0,π]2
f (x,−y) W (dx) W (dy) +ZZ[0,π]2

f (−x, y) W (dx)W (dy) .
When squaring I2 (f ) and taking its expectation, by the second Itˆo rule above, the
only terms that remain are those for which a product of the form W (dx) W (dx)
or W (dy) W (dy) does not appear. Thus we get only two terms left:

f (−x,−y) W (dx) W (dy)

There is a positive constant c (β) such that for |y| < 1, we have 1 − c (β) |y| ≤
(1 + y)β ≤ 1 + c (β) |y|. Thus for 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, we can write (1 + y)β = 1 + O (y)
where |O (y) /y| is bounded by c (β). We also use |cos x| ≤ 1 when x is small. We

We used the facts that y 7→ R y
0 x1−2H dx = O(cid:0)y2−2H(cid:1) near 0, that for any ε > 0,
y 7→R y
is a converging series. By taking ε ∈ (0, 2 − 2H), this proves the proposition. (cid:4)

7.3. Proof of Proposition 2. Let α ∈ (0, 1). We compute nvn by splitting its
series up at the value k = nα. We use the notation γ := 2 − 2H for compactness;
note that 1 > H > 3/4 implies 2γ ∈ (0, 1).
To lighten the notation slightly, we write KH,β := KHCH,β . From Proposition
1, we compute

nvn = n + 2K 2

In line (7.3), the term n is negligible in front of the remainder of that line (we
already knew this from Corollary 3.3), which is of order at least n1+αP[nα]
k=1 k−2γ ≍
n1+α+α(1−2γ) = n1+α(1−2γ) and no greater than n1+α(1−2γ)L2 (n). Thus the term
in line (7.3) is O(cid:0)n1+α(1−2γ)L2 (n)(cid:1). On the other hand, we set up the term in line
(7.4) to draw a precise comparison with a Riemann sum; thus modulo the factor
L2 (k) (1 + O (1/L (nα)))2 which is smaller than any power, we have an expression
which is asymptotically equivalent to a constant times n2−2γ. However we ﬁnd
1 + α (1 − 2γ) < 2 − 2γ ⇐⇒ 2γ < 1. Thus the terms in line (7.4) dominate those
in line (7.3) by a factor greater than a small power. In other words, we have proved
that for some ε > 0,

Since L (nα) = O (L (n)) trivially, and (1 + O (1/L (n)))p = (1 + O (1/L (n))) for
p > 0, and for any integer k ≥ nα we can write

We must now compute the asymptotics of the series in the last line above. Let
hγ (x) := (1 − x) x−2γ deﬁned on (0, 1]. We compute h′γ (x) = x−2γ (2γ − 1 − 2γ/x) <

hγ (x) dx(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
