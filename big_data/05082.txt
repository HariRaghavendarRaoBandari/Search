We obtain the Maxwell-J¨uttner distribution function at ﬁrst order in the post-Newtonian approx-
imation within the framework of general relativity. Taking into account the aforesaid distribution
function, we compute the particle four-ﬂow and energy-momentum tensor. We focus on the search
of static solutions for the gravitational potentials with spherical symmetry. In doing so, we obtain
the density, pressure and gravitational potential energy proﬁles in terms of dimensionless radial co-
ordinate by solving the aforesaid equations numerically. In particular, we ﬁnd the parametric proﬁle
for the equation of state p/ρ in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate. Due to its physical
relevance, we also ﬁnd the galaxy rotation curves using the post-Newtonian approximation. We join
two diﬀerent kinds of static solutions in order to account for the linear regime near the center and
the typical ﬂatten behavior at large radii as well.

INTRODUCTION

Galaxies are composed of many diﬀerent kinds of astro-
physical objects such as stars, interstellar gas, dust, and
dark matter amongst other things. Such system holds
together due to gravitational interaction amongst their
constituents.
In fact, they can be organized in bigger
astrophysical structures called clusters or super-clusters
[1]. It is generally believed that the amount of dark mat-
ter in a cluster is ten times bigger than the total amount
of gas and stars [2]. However, the recent analysis based
on both optical and radio data in spiral galaxies reveals
that the amount of dark matter is even less than previ-
ously thought [3]; where the gravitational ﬁeld associated
with spiral galaxies (such as NGC 7793, 1365, 6946 and
UGC 6446) is assumed to follow a global disk-like proﬁle
rather than spheroidal one [3]. For a detailed analysis of
the universal rotational curve of spiral galaxies and its
connection with dark matter see [4]. If the physical scale
of interest is much bigger than the size of these objects
then the latter ones can be considered as pointlike parti-
cles interacting among them, the gravity being the most
relevant interaction. Hence, one possible route to study
this system may be to solve its dynamical equation and
ﬁnd the trajectories of each one of the “particles”. Never-
theless, the number of particles involved in these systems
is enormously big so the aforesaid approach becomes un-
suitable. An alternate view of galaxies is as a system of
particles in six dimensional phase space. The galaxies are
then instantaneously described in terms of a distribution
function f (x, p) over the phase space, where x represents
the position vector and p stands for the momentum. In

this way, galaxies can be described in terms of ensem-
ble of particles along with a distribution function which
satisﬁes a kinetic equation [5]. If one obtains the distri-
bution function associated with the kinetic equation then
one can extract the main traits of the system under con-
sideration, for instance, one can be able to reconstruct
the average square velocity and several other moments
of the distribution function[5].

If the collision between two particles is a very rare
event then the collision operator of the Boltzmann equa-
tion can be neglected. In the latter case, one can work
with the collisionless Boltzmann equation (sometimes
this is also known as Vlasov equation) whose solution
turns out to be an equilibrium distribution function [5].
As an example, one thinks in a gas with a Boltzmann
distribution at equilibrium whose gravity center follows
a circular geodesic in Schwarzschild ﬁeld [6]. Or the case
of dark matter halos, dark matter only interacts gravi-
tationally and there are hardly any encounters, so that
one can describe the dark matter as a collisionless sys-
tem and use the Vlasov equation in order to describe
its evolution [7]. Besides, a self-consistent rederivation
of collisionless Boltzmann equation for self-gravitating
gases with post-Newtonian corrections [8] was obtained
recently; the case of post-Newtonian polytropes solutions
was examined numerically, focusing in the role played by
the relativistic correction to the rotation curves [8].

As is well-known the equations of general relativity
reduce to those of Newtonian gravity in the limit of
slow motions along with weak gravitational ﬁelds. New-
ton’s theory of gravity is good enough to describe all the
physics in the solar system, but it is incomplete and re-
quires some corrections to properly account for the shift
in the perihelion of Mercury [9].
In order to describe
physical phenomena like the latter one it becomes es-
sential to include post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to
the standard gravitational physics. A straightforward
manner to include all the relativistic corrections to New-

tonian gravity is by means of post-Newtonian formal-
ism. The post-Newtonian method relies on the idea that
one perturbs around a Minkowski background.
In do-
ing so, one considers that the perturbations of the met-
ric tensor along with those corresponding to the energy-
momentum tensor are both small ﬂuctuations, which can
be expanded in power of v/c, being v a typical velocity
in a system associated with matter and c is the speed of
light [9]. One of the main reasons to examine relativistic
corrections in galactic dynamics concerns to the issue of
the rotation curves predicted by Newtonian theory. In
Newtonian theory, rotation curves typically increase lin-
early near the origin up to a maximum and then vanish
for large radii, while the measured circular velocity curve
for the galaxies leads to small value near the center, in-
creases linearly, then exhibits a small cusp and tends to a
ﬁnite nonzero value at large radii. One can clearly recog-
nize the contribution of the dark matter halo in order to
generate the ﬂat circular velocity curve [7]. Indeed, some
authors pointed out that the inclusion of post-Newtonian
corrections in astrophysical models can really help to re-
duce the amount of dark matter needed to explain rota-
tion curves which ﬂatten at large radii [10]. Of course,
these corrections by their own cannot overcome the whole
problem of generating ﬂat rotation curves, however, can
reduce the amount of dark matter in relation with the
Newtonian models.

For the reasons mentioned above, the study of rela-
tivistic corrections within the context of kinetic theory
seems to be a very promising route. Bearing this in
mind, many authors devoted some eﬀorts to apply ki-
netic theory plus post-Newtonian method to describe as-
trophysical models. They explored the kinetic theory
of self-gravitating gases with axial symmetry within the
framework of post-Newtonian formalism applied to the
case of razor thin disks, focusing on axially symmetric
galaxy models[11]. In particular, they obtained the rota-
tion curves and mass proﬁles for the post-Newtonian ver-
sion of Morgan-Morgan disks and derived the virial theo-
rem in 1PN approximation as well [11]. Continuing with
this line of research, Nguyen and Pedraza studied self-
gravitating system with polytropic equation of state in
the PN approximation of general relativity, the physical
motivation is that such equation can be used to describe
many astrophysical models such as white dwarfs, neutron
stars, galactic halos, and globular clusters amongst oth-
ers. By solving the Einstein-Vlasov system of equations,
they found a family of star clusters with anisotropic in
velocity space within PN scheme. In addition, they ana-
lyzed the stability of circular orbits for radial perturba-
tions [12].

Here, we are going to use the relativistic collisionless
Boltzmann equation along with the Maxwell-J¨uttner dis-
tribution function to derive the Maxwell-J¨uttner distri-
bution function in the 1PN approximation. In doing so,
we introduce a peculiar velocity associated with the par-
ticle velocity in the gas frame, use the Tolman’s law and
integrate over the peculiar velocity space. We calculate

2

the particle ﬂow at 1PN order while energy–momentum
tensor components are derived at diﬀerent PN orders, for
instance, the diagonal temporal part is calculated at 1PN
order but the diagonal spatial components are reported
at 2PN order.
In this way, we derive the macroscopic
energy momentum tensor from the Maxwell-J¨uttner dis-
tribution function at 1PN order. Our result coincides
with the one obtained from ﬂuids description [9]. We nu-
merically solve the nonlinear equation associated to the
gravitational potential ﬁelds. Our analysis diﬀers from
the one reported for post-Newtonian polytropes in di-
verse manners [8]. We contrast the Newtonian with the
PN proﬁles of matter density, circular velocity and grav-
itational potential energy. As was expected, the pressure
proﬁle only includes PN corrections. For certain value
radius, say rc, the gravitational ﬁelds become complex
and therefore we must match the latter solution with a
physical one. We show the procedure to obtain physical
gravitational potentials by joining with other solutions
at rc. In addition, we notice that such method leads to
circular velocity proﬁles that ﬂatten at large radii.

Our paper is outlined as follows. In Sec. II, we give
the general derivation of the Maxwell-J¨uttner distribu-
tion function at 1PN order. We devote Sec. III to ob-
tain the particle four-ﬂow and energy-momentum tensor
within the PN approximation from the Maxwell-J¨uttner
distribution function at 1PN order. We seek static solu-
tion for the gravitational potentials associated with non-
linear Poisson-like equations in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, we
solve numerically the aforesaid equations, present the
density, pressure and circular velocity proﬁles.
In Sec.
VI, we ﬁnally reexamine the issue of generating ﬂat ro-
tation curves by gluing two diﬀerent solutions at certain
radius. In Sec. VII the conclusions are stated. Through-
out the article we adopt the metric signature (−, +, +, +)
and we do not set the speed of light c equal to the unity
for practical reasons.

II. THE MAXWELL-J ¨UTTNER DISTRIBUTION

FUNCTION IN THE 1PN APPROXIMATION

The kinetic theory of relativistic gases in the presence
of gravitational ﬁelds is based in the Boltzmann equation
(see e.g.[5] and [13]-[16])

pµ ∂f

∂xµ − Γi

µνpµpν ∂f

∂pi = C(f, f ).

(1)

Here f ≡ f (x, p, t) is the one-particle distribution func-
tion in the phase space spanned by the space x and three-
momentum p coordinates, Γi
µν are Christoﬀel symbols
and C(f, f ) is the collision operator of the Boltzmann
equation which takes into account the product of the two
distribution functions of the colliding particles.
In the
above expression the mass-shell condition pµpµ = −m2c2
– where m is the particle rest mass – was taken into ac-
count.

Equilibrium is characterized by a vanishing collision
term C(f, f ) and this implies that the distribution func-
tion is the Maxwell-J¨uttner distribution function

f =

n

4πm2ckT K2(ζ)

kT (cid:19) .
exp(cid:18) pµUµ

(2)

Above k is the Boltzmann constant and n, T, U µ are
the particle number density, the temperature and the
four-velocity of the gas, respectively. Furthermore, ζ =
mc2/kT represents the ratio of the rest energy of a parti-
cle mc2 and the thermal energy of the gas kT and K2(ζ)
denotes the modiﬁed Bessel function of second kind. The
ultrarelativistic regime of the gas is attained at high tem-
peratures where ζ ≪ 1, while the nonrelativistic one oc-
curs at low temperatures where ζ ≫ 1. Another ex-
pression for the Maxwell-J¨uttner distribution function is
given in terms of the chemical potential µ – the Gibbs
function per particle – namely,

3

thanks to the expressions of the metric tensor compo-
nents (51) – (55) given in the Appendix A. Next by
introducing the four-velocity of the gas particles uµ =
(u0, u0vi/c) it follows from (9) that up to 1/c4 order we
have

(10)

The above expression is also valid for the components
of the ﬂuid four-velocity U µ = (U 0, U 0V i/c) by replacing
u0 and vi by U 0 and V i, respectively.

If we introduce the peculiar velocity W = v − V –
which is the particle velocity in the gas frame – and by
considering Tolman’s law (4) we get the following rela-
tionship

The ﬁrst equation above is known as Tolman’s law
[17, 18] while the second one as Klein’s law [19] and both
were introduced within the framework of phenomenolog-
ical theories.

From the two expressions for the Maxwell-J¨uttner dis-

tribution function (2) and (3) we get

n

4πm2ckT K2(ζ)

= exp(cid:16) µ

kT − 1(cid:17) = exp(cid:18) µ0

kT0 − 1(cid:19) ,

(6)

where the last equality follows from Tolman (4) and Klein
(5) laws. Hence we may write the left-hand side of (6) in
terms of n0 and T0, namely,

n

4πm2ckT K2(ζ)

=

n0

4πm2ckT0K2(ζ0)

.

(7)

Let us calculate the Maxwell-J¨uttner distribution func-
tion (2) in the ﬁrst post-Newtonian approximation (1PN
approximation).

First we follow [9] and write the line element

Furthermore, up to 1/c2 order the modiﬁed Bessel func-

tion, see Appendix B for further details. Here the energy

by considering the metric tensor and the four-velocity in

IV. THE SEARCH FOR STATIC SOLUTIONS

In this section we search for static solutions of Ein-
stein’s ﬁeld equations, which in the 1PN approximation
reduces to the following equations for the gravitational
potentials (see e.g. [9])

Note that we have written the energy-momentum ten-
sor in terms of the particle four-velocities uµ instead of
the particle four-momentum pµ = muµ. Here we follow
[5, 13–16] and considered that the element of integration

is the invariant √−gd3p/(−p0) with the covariant com-
ponent p0, which is diﬀerent from √−gd3p/(p0) in the

1PN approximation, which was adopted by [8].

In the 1PN approximation the diﬀerential element d3u
in terms of the peculiar velocity W up to the 1/c2 order
is given by

d3u =(cid:26)1 +

1

c2(cid:20) 5(V 2 + 2(W · V) + W 2)

2

− 3φ(cid:21)(cid:27) d3W.

(16)
Furthermore, up to the 1/c2 order we can build the rela-
tion

−(g00u0 + g0iui) = −g00u0(cid:18)1 +
≈ u0(cid:18)1 + 2

c2(cid:19) ,

φ

g0iui

g00u0(cid:19)

(17)

thanks to the expressions of the metric tensor given in
the Appendix A. Next up to the 1/c2 order we have the
following relationship

√−g d3u

−(g00u0 + g0iui)

(18)

Once we know the distribution function in the 1PN
approximation we can calculate the particle four-ﬂow
and the energy-momentum tensor in this approximation.
N µ and the energy-
T µν are split in diﬀerent
orders of the ratio (v/c)n (see [9]) where v can be identi-

The particle four-ﬂow N µ = Pn
momentum tensor T µν = Pn
ﬁed with the thermal velocity of a particle v =pkT0/m.

First from (14) together with (13) and (18) we get
through integration of the resulting equation that the
time component of the particle four-ﬂow becomes

must given by ve = √−2φ. Now by considering a vanish-

ing gas velocity V = 0 we can perform the integrations

circular velocities have large values. Furthermore, as the
mass density, the large values of the circular velocity are
attained for smaller values of the parameter ζ0, which
correspond to large values of the temperature T0. The
behavior of the circular velocity for ideal gases diﬀers
from the one where the distribution function is charac-
terized by a polytropic function of the energy [8], since
in the latter case the values of the circular velocity in the
1PN approximation are smaller than the corresponding
Newtonian approximation. Here the large values of the
circular velocity in the 1PN approximation are due to
the fact that the increase of the temperature of the gas,
increases the thermal velocity of the particles of the gas

VI. CIRCULAR ROTATION CURVE

As we mentioned in Sec. I, one of the most challeng-
ing puzzles of current astrophysics is to account for the
gravitational mass associated with large structures such
as galaxies and cluster or super-cluster of galaxies. It is
well-known that the rotation curves of galaxies do not fol-
low a Newtonian proﬁle, which indicates that Newtonian
gravity fails to predict the mass distribution of such ob-
jects. One way to explain such mismatch is by introduc-
ing an unknown component with zero pressure dubbed
dark matter. This component cannot be observed or
measured directly but can be detected through its grav-
itational eﬀects with the nearby environment (galaxies),
in particular, this means that dark matter does not in-
teract directly with the standard matter (at least not
with the ones contained in the standard particle model)
[1]. While in the literature there are lots of particle-like
models for dark matter, none of them seem to be able
to properly describe dark matter completely at galactic
scale or cosmological scales, then the only true physi-
cal information about dark matter is how it gravitation-
ally interacts with normal matter (galaxies). Indeed, the
gravitational lensing within a cluster of galaxies, reveals
that the presence of concentrated dark matter in the in-
ner zone of a cluster. Something that clearly cannot be
predicted with ordinary matter within Newtonian theory
because the mass of the galaxy is related with the circu-
lar rotation velocity V through the Newton’s law, namely
the speed V in a circular orbit at radius r is related to the
mass M (< r) interior to that radius by the exact equa-
tion M (< r) = rV 2/G, being G Newton’s constant. One
way to realize about the missing mass fact is by using

two well-known procedures. To be more precise, apply-
ing the virial theorem to a cluster, one can determine the
virial mass of the cluster and summing up all the mass of
galaxies within the cluster one can estimate the baryonic
mass. It turns out that the former one is 20 times bigger
than the latter one, showing in this way the existence of
additional (nonbaryonic) matter in the cluster [1].

So far we have focused on the basic features of self-
gravitating systems of ideal gases in the 1PN approxi-
mation. Now, we devote our attention to the circular
rotation curve due to its physical relevance in modern
astrophysics at theoretical and observational levels, and
in particular we examine the matching of two solutions at

a critical radius, sayerc. The idea behind such standard

procedure is to reproduce the well-known observational
features of the galaxy rotation curves, namely, a linear
regime at small radii, passes through a cusp, and ends
with a ﬂatten shape at large radii. Let us now show
how this shape can be obtained with the model at hand
within the 1PN approximation. Fig. 2 shows that model

because the circular rotation curve grows linear with the
radial distance, then it passes through small cusp and be-

to zero in the limit of large radii. Therefore, we need to
introduce another type of potentials to do the job. In or-

we ﬁnd that the circular rotation curves ﬂatten at very

lead us to the right ﬂatten curve, however, the Yukawa
term is better because it behaves smoother than the
Coulomb potential for large radii. We end this section
by mentioning some physical outcomes of our previous

where we have taken k = 1 without loss of generality,

for large radius. In this zone, the post-Newtonian den-
sity and pressure are entangled provided we only know

by eρmass = −∇2eφ2 = α/er2 which clearly goes to zero
eψ2, that is, eρP N +epP N = −∇2eψ2 = −γe−er/er − δ/er2,
then eρP N +epP N also vanishes in this limit. Notice that
eρP N +epP N is always positive because γ < 0 and δ < 0.

All in all, we showed that rotation curves with a ﬂatten
proﬁle can be obtained within the post-Newtonian ap-
proximation, starting from the Maxwell-J¨uttner distribu-
tion function at 1PN and solving the corresponding grav-
itational potential at 1PN order. As a ﬁnal remark, we
should emphasize that in our approach the ergodic func-
tion used diﬀers substantially from the polytrope proﬁle
explored in [8].

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have built an astrophysical model based on the
Maxwell-J¨uttner distribution function within the frame-
work of general relativity which is described using post-
Newtonian formalism. In order to obtain this expression,
we have integrated over the peculiar velocity 3D space,
keeping only the relevant terms up to 1PN order. With
this ergodic distribution at hand, we have obtained the

9

general form of Newtonian density along with the post-
Newtonian density and pressure terms which enter in the
energy-momentum tensor by using several Gaussian inte-
grals (cf. Appendix B). This allowed us to demonstrate
that our general expression coincides with the one re-
ported by Weinberg [9], validating our procedure. As an
example of how to apply this procedure, we considered
the case of particle four-ﬂow and calculated its temporal
and spatial components.

From the energy density and pressure terms at 1PN,
we looked for static solution by analyzing the bound-
ary value problem. We found that the energy density,
pressure and gravitational potentials proﬁles in terms of
dimensionless radial coordinate by solving the aforesaid
equations numerically.
In particular, we found the en-
ergy density vanishes for large radii but approaches to a
constant value at the origin, further, such value becomes
larger for smaller values of ζ0 [see Fig. 1]. Contrary
to the case of polytropic ergodic distribution explored in
[8], the energy density remains always positive at 1PN
order. As part of the process of evaluating the circu-
lar velocity proﬁles, we obtained that post-Newtonian
curves reach larger values in relation with the Newto-
nian case. In both cases, we have found that these curves
exhibit a linear behavior near the center and then pass
through a cusp [see Fig. 2].
Interestingly enough, we
have found the behavior of the circular velocity for ideal
gases diﬀers from the one where the distribution func-
tion is characterized by a polytropic function of the en-
ergy [8], since in the latter case the values of the circular
velocity in the 1PN approximation are smaller than the
corresponding Newtonian approximation.
In our case,
the large values of the circular velocity in the 1PN ap-
proximation are due to the fact that the increase of the
temperature of the gas, increases the thermal velocity of

the behavior of the dimensionless gravitational potential

the particles of the gas pkT0/m. We have examined
energy eU . So we have found that the Newtonian grav-

itational potential energy is always negative, while the
post-Newtonian gravitational potential energies change
their sign for large values of the radial distance from the
conﬁguration center [see Fig. 3]. The temperature of the

gas in the post-Newtonian term eφ2/2ζ0 determines the

sign change of the gravitational potential energy. The
gravitational potential energy exhibits the same behav-
ior that the one associated with a polytropic distribution
function with polytropic index n = 3.
In addition, we
found a parametric proﬁle of the equation of state p(ρ)
in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate, see Fig.
5. At small radii, the ratio pressure-density becomes al-
most constant; increasing ζ0 the constant reaches larger
values or equivalently the thermal energy of the ideal gas
decreases considerably. The situation is reversed at large
radii.

We have patched together two diﬀerent kinds of grav-

itational potentials at a critical radius, called erc, in or-

der to have a well-deﬁned boundary problem, provided
the potentials became complex beyond this radius. The

physical motivation in dealing with this issue was to se-
lect gravitational potentials which reproduce a ﬂatten be-
havior in the rotation curve at large radii, provided the
linear and the cusp zones were already described by those
potentials obtained by integrating numerically the energy
density and pressure coming from the Maxwell-J¨uttner
distribution function at 1PN. In doing so, we have shown
that one of the potentials has a Coulomb form while the
other one presents two kinds of terms, a Yukawa contribu-
tion plus a logarithmic term. Indeed, the term responsi-
ble for the constant circular velocity at large radii turned
out to be the logarithmic term. Regarding the changes
introduced by these solutions, we have found that the
Coulomb potential led to an inverse square power law
for the Newtonian density, as one could expect. How-
ever, we could not disentangle the post-Newtonian den-
sity from the post-Newtonian pressure, thus we found

quantity, vanishing for large radii only.
