Abstract. We give an overview of a model to describe deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) oﬀ
the deuteron with a spectator proton, based on the virtual nucleon approximation (VNA).
The model accounts for the ﬁnal-state interactions (FSI) of the DIS debris with the specta-
tor proton. Values of the rescattering cross section are obtained by ﬁts to high-momentum
spectator data. By using the so-called “pole extrapolation” method, free neutron structure
functions can be obtained by extrapolating low-momentum spectator proton data to the
on-shell neutron pole. We apply this method to the BONuS data set and ﬁnd a surpris-
ing Bjorken x dependence, indicating a possible rise of the neutron to proton structure
function ratio at high x.

1 Introduction
Tagged proton spectator DIS oﬀ the deuteron (e+d → e(cid:48) +X + ps) can be used in several ways to study
the role of QCD dynamics at nucleonic length scales. At low spectator momenta, one has access to
the structure functions of an almost on-shell neutron. Together with proton structure functions, ﬂavor
separation can be performed and the d and u quark densities can be determined. At higher proton
spectator momenta, the deuteron is in a high-density conﬁguration and medium modiﬁcations of the
structure functions can be quantiﬁed. In kinematics where FSI mechanisms are large, one can use
the reaction to constrain models for the X–proton rescattering. Recently, two experiments at Jeﬀerson
Lab have measured the reaction in diﬀerent kinematics: Deeps at higher spectator momenta of a few
hundred MeV [1] and, BONuS at lower ones around 100 MeV [2]. In the near future, the BONuS12
experiment will run [3] and the reaction is considered as a method to extract neutron structure at a
future electron-ion collider [4]. In order to provide meaningful interpretations of the measured data,
theoretical models that quantify the importance of the FSI in the reaction are needed [5–10]. The
major diﬃculty in doing this is that one lacks detailed information about the composition and space-
time evolution of the hadronic system produced in the deep-inelastic scattering and how this changes
as a function of Bjorken x and Q2. Here, we present work in a model that has been used to account for
FSI mechanisms at moderate and high Bjorken x in e + d → e(cid:48) + X + ps [11–13] as well as inclusive
deuteron DIS [14, 15].

2 Formalism

The model introduced in Ref. [11] accounted for FSI eﬀects in DIS from the deuteron based on
general properties of high-energy diﬀractive scattering. The underlying assumption was that due to
the restricted phase space (ﬁnite values of W and Q2), the minimal Fock state component of the wave
function can be used to describe DIS from the bound nucleon. In this case the scattered state consists
of three outgoing valence quarks. The model uses the virtual nucleon approximation (VNA) [6, 7, 16]
and only considers the proton-neutron component of the deuteron wave function. The eﬀects of FSI
are encoded in an eﬀective rescattering amplitude between the produced hadronic mass X and the
spectator proton. Given the GeV range of the energies in the experiments, the rescatterings will occur
over small angles and be highly diﬀractive. This allows us to model the rescattering amplitude using
the generalized eikonal approximation (GEA) [17]. In the GEA, the eikonal rescattering amplitude
fX(cid:48)N,XN is parametrized using three parameters (total rescattering cross section σXN, slope factor B,
and real part ), that have a dependence on the Q2 and Bjorken x (or equivalently invariant mass W of
hadronic products X):

fX(cid:48)N,XN = σ(Q2, x)

(1)
The cross sections including FSI are obtained in a factorized approach, whereby the DIS interaction
of the virtual photon with the oﬀ-shell nucleon (encoded in the structure functions FiN) is taken out
of the integration over the momentum of the on-shell intermediate spectator nucleon. Finally, the four
structure functions of the tagged spectator DIS process can be written in the following form

Here, α(i), β(i) are kinematical factors (see Ref. [11] for detailed expressions), and S D(ps) is the
distorted deuteron momentum distribution that contains an impulse approximation (IA) contribution
and an FSI contribution including the rescattering amplitude of Eq. (1) [11].

= (pD − ps)2 = m2

Even for very low spectator momenta, the struck neutron is still oﬀ-shell in the deuteron. One can
still perform an analytical continuation, however, of the amplitude into the unphysical kinematical
region and extrapolate it to the on-shell point p2
n. The IA part of the amplitude
i
has a pole at this value of p2
i , while the FSI part does not due to the additional integration over the
loop momentum. This is the so-called “no-loop theorem” [7]. This means carrying out the pole
extrapolation automatically gets rid of nuclear eﬀects and allows one to extract the on-shell neutron
structure function. This procedure is similar to the ones ﬁrst proposed by Chew and Lowin hadron-
proton scattering [18] . Due to the small binding energy of the deuteron, the actual extrapolation
length to the on-shell pole is very small, and there are also no issues regarding a zero crossing for
p2
i . The pole extrapolation procedure for the extraction of F2n consists of multiplying the measured
deuteron structure function, FS I,EXP
by the factor I(αs, ps⊥, t) [7], which cancels the singularity of the
IA amplitude and is normalized such that

3 Results

Figure 1 shows a comparison between one data set from the high spectator momentum deeps exper-
iment [1] with our model calculations. The most striking feature of the data is the large excess at
forward spectator angles. This is markedly diﬀerent from the quasi-elastic breakup case where the

cross section peaks in the perpendicular region [19]. It is clear the IA calculation has an almost ﬂat
dependence on the spectator angle and can in no way reproduce the full range of the data. An FSI
calculation with values of the rescattering parameters inspired by the known NN ones is able to re-
produce the angular dependence better but still underestimates the data. Intuitively, this is no surprise
as for the value of W = 2 GeV in Fig. 1, we are well above the nucleon mass. Therefore, we have
ﬁtted a value of σ for each {W, Q2} setting of the data. The calculation using this ﬁtted parameter is
also shown for the kinematics of Fig. 1. For a comparison with the full deeps data set, we refer to
Ref. [11].

In Fig. 2, we show the W and Q2 dependence of the ﬁtted values of σ from our analysis of the
deeps data. The parameter σ has a value of about 60 mb at the ∆-resonance, and then clearly increases
with increasing invariant mass W of the hadronic products. More interesting is the dependence on Q2,
where there is a signiﬁcant decrease in the σ parameter with increasing Q2. This could be a sign of
a color transparency signal in this reaction, where the hadronic products are produced in a colorless
point-like conﬁguration at higher momentum transfers, which experiences reduced strong interactions
with the remaining hadrons. More measurements at higher Q2 values are needed, however, to further
investigate this behavior.

In Ref. [12], the pole extrapolation method was applied to the high momentum spectator deeps
data. Given the large extrapolation length, no robust results were obtained for F2n. With the more
recent low spectator momentum BONuS data, which measured down to proton momenta of 70 MeV,
the extrapolation length is very short and pole extrapolation became applicable. One problem with the
BONuS data is that the measurements for diﬀerent spectator momenta happened at diﬀerent and not
well known eﬃciencies. In the original analysis, the data was therefore normalized to an IA model
[20] in the backward spectator region. In Ref. [13], we renormalized the BONuS data using our FSI
model at high W, Q2 (where the neutron structure function is quite well known), using the rescattering
parameter values extracted in our previous ﬁt to the the deeps data. Taking these renormalized data,
we implemented the pole extrapolation method for the BONuS data. Figure 3 shows an example for
one kinematical setting. The two data points at each t(cid:48) value correspond to data taken at two initial
beam energy values and one can clearly observe they are consistent with each other. Plotting our
model calculations with the data, it is also clear that through implementing Eq. (3), FSI eﬀects indeed
become smaller as one moves closer to the on-shell pole. As the extrapolation curve shows in Fig. 3,
the extrapolation distance to the on-shell point is reasonable.

For each kinematical setting of the BONuS data, pole extrapolation was carried out as in Fig. 3,
and a weighted average was taken over all measured spectator angle bins. The ﬁnal result is shown
in Fig. 4 as the ratio of F2n/F2p where the parametrization of Ref. [21] was used for the F2p values.
We repeat that the values obtained in this manner are free of Fermi motion and nuclear medium mod-
iﬁcation eﬀects. The systematic errors were estimated by taking all uncertainties in the data and our
normalization procedure (deuteron wave function, structure function parametrization, renormalization
ﬁt) into account in a Monte Carlo simulation [13]. The most striking feature in Fig. 4 is the rise of the
ratio at large Bjorken x. The results at lower Bjorken x < 0.5 are in agreement with existing estimates.
It is worth noting that the upward trend of the ratio at higher x is not due to our renormalization of
the data. Indeed, the values of the ratio are higher without the renormalization applied. As the W
(≈ 1.18 GeV) values corresponding to the highest x values in Fig. 4 are in the sub-DIS regime, one
cannot directly relate the rise of the ratio to the underlying properties of the u and d quark pdf’s. Such
a connection can only be made using duality arguments. It is worth noting, however, that the duality
analysis of the BONuS data [22], concluded that the ∆-resonance contributes to the duality, within 20-
30% accuracy. One possible explanation of the rise could be the presence of isosinglet qq short-range
correlations (SRCs) in the nucleon at x → 1. Such a correlation will result in the same momentum
sharing eﬀect, which is observed recently in asymmetric nuclei in the NN SRC region [23].

4 Conclusion

We have presented a selection of results obtained in a model used to describe the tagged spectator DIS
process oﬀ the deuteron including the eﬀect of FSI. We obtained a good description of data at higher
spectator momenta and used these data to ﬁt the Q2- and W-dependence of the rescattering parameter
σ. For data at lower spectator momenta, we applied the pole extrapolation method, which allows to
extract the free neutron structure function in a way that eliminates nuclear eﬀects. We observe an
intriguing rise of the F2n/F2p ratio at high Bjorken x.
