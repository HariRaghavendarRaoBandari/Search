We study the applicability of collisional models for non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum
systems. By allowing interactions between the separate environmental degrees of freedom in between
collisions we are able to construct a collision model that allows to study quantum memory eﬀects
in open system dynamics. We also discuss the possibility to embed non-Markovian collision model
dynamics into Markovian collision model dynamics in an extended state space. As a concrete
example we show how using the proposed class of collision models we can discretely model non-
Markovian amplitude damping of a qubit. In the time-continuous limit, we obtain the well-known
results for spontaneous decay of a two level system in to a structured zero-temperature reservoir.

INTRODUCTION

An open quantum system consists of a system of inter-
est (S, the open system) and an environment (E). Usu-
ally, the eﬀects of the environment onto the open system
dynamics are incorporated into an eﬀective description in
terms of master equations [1, 2] for the reduced density
operator of the open system. In general, the validity of
the master equation approach is guaranteed in a Marko-
vian setting, where the master equation takes the fa-
mous Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL)
form and is a generator of a dynamical semigroup [3, 4].
Often, when starting from the microscopic model for
S +E, a series of approximations has to be made in order
to be able to describe the open system dynamics in terms
of the GKSL-master equation [2, 5]. Naturally, these
approximations are not generally valid and the dynami-
cal semigroup is not an exact description for all possible
physical situations of interest [6].

Collision models oﬀer an alternative route to the de-
scription of open quantum system dynamics [7–20]. This
description is appealing because the reduced system can
be obtained in many cases without any approximations,
hence the complete positivity (CP) of the dynamical map
is guaranteed. Collision models also provide a physically
transparent way to introduce indirect measurements and
conditional states for the open system [13, 14]. One can
look at collision models as an approximation of continu-
ous in time quantum dynamics but the study of discrete-
in-time dynamics is interesting in its own right as we will
show in this article.

A collision model consists of a system that interacts
locally in time with diﬀerent environmental degrees of
freedom [9]. As such, the description gives the dynamics
discretely in time in terms of maps Φn : S(HS ) → S(HS ),
where S(HS ) is the state space of the open system.
If, at each collision, the open system interacts with a
new uncorrelated environmental degree of freedom then
the dynamical map satisﬁes the semigroup property:
Φn+m = ΦnΦm [8–11, 15, 16], see also Fig. 1. Some-
times we call separate environmental degree of freedoms
sub-environments.

During recent years there has been considerable inter-
est to generalize the collision model description beyond
Markovian quantum processes, ie. beyond the dynami-
cal semigroup [12, 14, 17–20]. One way to do this is to
introduce correlated localized bath states [17, 19]. For ex-
ample by using correlated localized baths any indivisible
quantum channel can be simulated [17]. For our purposes
the pre-correlated bath particles are not suitable because
we want to introduce the memory as a part of the colli-
sion model dynamics. A second way to introduce mem-
ory eﬀects to the open system dynamics is to consider a
system that sequentially collides with the same local en-
vironment but the evolution of the local environment is
given by a quantum channel between the collisions. This
type of model was considered in [12] for the purpose of
processing quantum information. A third, and the most
relevant way for our purposes, is to allow an interaction
between the separate environmental degrees of freedom in
between collisions. In [18] the authors considered a par-
tial swap interaction between the separate environmental
degrees of freedom that allows to propagate correlations
from earlier collisions forward in time. The authors were
able to obtain a general form for the master equation in
the continuous time limit. However, a link to the exactly
solvable model for spontaneous decay of a two level sys-
tem into a structured reservoir [6] is still missing and will
be established based on our novel collision model. There-
fore, our work is in close analogy of that in [18] since we
also want to introduce tunable memory eﬀects by incor-
porating interactions between the environmental degrees
of freedom, but we take this interaction to be unitary.

The structure of the paper is the following.

In Sec.
II we introduce the concept of a collision model in de-
tail. First, we discuss a construction that leads always
to a CP-divisible discrete dynamical map. Then we shift
our focus to a generalized model that allows to study in-
divisible quantum dynamical maps and non-Markovian
dynamics. Section III contains an application of the col-
lision model, we show how time continuous amplitude
damping can be simulated using our discrete collision
model.
In Sec. IV we discuss in detail the divisibility
and non-Markovianity properties of the example system.
In Sec. V we show how possibly non-Markovian colli-

sion model dynamics can be embedded into Markovian
collision dynamics for an extended system and lastly in
Sec. VI we conclude.

In a collision model the system of interest (the open
system) interacts locally in time in a discrete way with
(cid:78)n
separate degrees of freedom of the environment. A
suitable Hilbert space for the collision model is H =
HS
k=1 He,k, where HS is the Hilbert space of the sys-
tem and He,k is the Hilbert space for k-th environment
particle. There is in general no restriction on the possible
initial state |Ψ0(cid:105) ∈ H of the collision model. However,
we aim to connect the open system dynamics of the col-
lision model in the continuous limit to a dynamics given
by a dynamical map Φt and therefore we assume that
the initial state is of the form |Ψ0(cid:105) = |ϕ(cid:105) ⊗ |ω(cid:105). Now,
k He,k could be generally correlated, and it
is sometimes advantageous to consider correlated initial
states [17] but we aim in this work to model quantum
memory eﬀects dynamically and therefore we choose the
In general we focus
on such collision models that might have local dynamics
on the open system only, given by unitary operator U0,
interaction of the open system and ith sub-environment,
given by unitary operator Wi, and possibly a unitary
coupling between the sub-environments i and j given by
Vij.

k |0k(cid:105).

Before going into details of the collision models we de-
ﬁne for further discussion the concept of divisibility. We
call the dynamical map Φn ≡ Φn,0 divisible if the dynam-
ical map can be composed as Φn+m = Φm+n,nΦn, where
Φn+m,n is a completely positive and trace preserving
(CPT) map. If the “two times” map Φk,l is not CPT for
some pair (k, l) then the dynamics is said to be indivisible.
The two times map is deﬁned as Φn+m,n = Φn+m ◦ Φ−1
[21]. These notions generalize to continuous families of
maps in a trivial way.

1. Collision model for divisible quantum dynamics

The simplest possible model ﬁtting to our above de-
scribed scenario emerges when we choose Vij = I. The
ﬁrst two steps of this type of model
is presented in
Fig. 1. The open system dynamics for this type of col-
lisional model is given by ρ0 = |ϕ(cid:105)(cid:104)ϕ| (cid:55)→ ρn = En(ρ0) =
trE[(WnU0 ··· W1U0)ρ0 ⊗ |ω(cid:105)(cid:104)ω|(U
n)]. It is
clear that the dynamical map E satisﬁes discrete semi-
group property En+m = EnEm, where m, n ∈ Z+. Also
En = E n clearly holds. The continuous limit of a collision
model can be thought to emerge when Et ≈ E n
g , where
n = [t/g2] (where [x] is a nearest integer to x) and g is
some parameter of the collision model ultimately to be re-
lated to the small time interval during which single colli-
sions take place [17]. A heuristic way to obtain the GKSL

master equation, ie. the continuous limit for this colli-
(ρt) = Lρt
sion model is to use the relation ˙ρt = d
valid for continuous dynamical maps, whenever the in-
verse exists. We would also like to point out the trivial
observation that the (i − 1)th environment particle does
not participate after the (i− 1)th collision to the dynam-
ics anymore.

As an example we consider a collision model where
system and environment consists of qubits and initially
all the environment qubits are set to their ground state
|0(cid:105). We take the interaction between the system and the
ith sub-environment during a collision to be

that in the limit δt → 0 the collision model approximates
the amplitude damping dynamical semigroup generated
by

Lρ =γσ−ρσ+ − γ

{σ+σ−, ρ}.

2. Collision model for indivisible quantum dynamics

Our main goal is to describe indivisible quantum dy-
namics, using collisional models where we allow for in-
teraction between the separate environmental degrees of
freedom. The simplest possible way to do this to allow
only nearest neighbor interactions. The dynamical map
for the open system is

ρn ≡ Φn(|ϕ(cid:105)(cid:104)ϕ|) =trE[Kn (|ϕ(cid:105)(cid:104)ϕ| ⊗ |ω(cid:105)(cid:104)ω|) K†
n],

(3)

where K1 = W1U0 and Kn is deﬁned iteratively as Kn =
WnU0Vn,n−1Kn−1 for n ≥ 2. A schematic presentation
of such model can be found in Fig. 2. Clearly, the state of
the ith sub-environment is generally not |0i(cid:105) when Wi is
applied because before the ith collision the uncorrelated
ith sub-environment ﬁrst interacts with (i − 1)th sub-
environment via Vi,i−1 and after that the system interacts

with ith environmental degree of freedom via Wi.

The question of constructing indivisible quantum dy-
namics is thus a question of choosing suitable two qubit
unitary Vj+1,j. Obviously, if we choose Vj+1,j = UA⊗UB
the construction is essentially equivalent to the one pre-
sented in Fig. 1 since UA can be absorbed to Wj and
UB is just a rotation of the initial state. Therefore the
unitary operator Vi+1,i has to be at least non-separable.
Intuitively it is clear that by introducing the cou-
pling Vi+1,i we can propagate information from the ear-
lier collisions trough the correlations created between
He,i+1 ⊗He,i and these correlations might have inﬂuence
on the nature of the dynamics. To verify this intuition we
ﬁrst tested the collision model construction by sampling
pairs of two qubit unitaries Z1 and Z2 from the uniform
Haar measure [23] and using those as a building block
for the collision model. Speciﬁcally we constructed the
maps Φ2,Φ1 and Φ2,1 = Φ2 ◦ Φ−1
according to Eq. (3).
By sampling 106 pairs (Z1, Z2) we observed that approx-
imately 17% of the maps Φ2 were indivisible, ie. Φ2,1 was
not completely positive.

unitaries V = e−i(cid:80)3
As a second test we chose randomly pairs of two qubit
j=1 αj σj⊗σj such that π/4 ≥ α1 ≥
α2 ≥ α3 ≥ 0, α1 + α2 ≥ π/4 and α2 + α3 ≤ π/4. These
correspond to maximally entangling unitaries [24].
In
this case by sampling 106 pairs we obtained that 35%
of samples resulted in indivisible dynamical maps. From
these two tests we can conclude that the proposed col-
lision model (see Eq. (3) and Fig. 2) is suitable for the
study of general open system dynamics.

3. Collision models and repeated measurements

Further, we would also like to point out that the colli-
sion model construction presented in Fig. 2 can be used
for studying repeated quantum measurements [13, 14, 22]
in a setting where the average dynamics does not form
a semigroup. Due to only having a nearest neighbor in-
teraction between the sub-environments the (i− 1)th en-
vironmental degree of freedom does not participate after
the ith collision to the dynamics anymore. In Figs. 1 and
2 the non-participating environmental degrees of freedom
are indicated with a dashed line. Therefore after the ith

happens because any observable E(k)
on He,k commutes with Wi, for i (cid:54)= k and Vi,i−1 for
k (cid:54)= i∧ k (cid:54)= i− 1. To state this idea as simply as possible
we refer to Fig. 2 and to the total state after just two
steps. Let U0 = I, then the total state with measurement

Let ρT = K2ρ0 ⊗ |ω(cid:105)(cid:104)ω|K

[W2, M (1)

the same reduced state ρ2. By continuing this way and
adding a measurement on He,k−1 after Vk,k−1 in the col-
lision model we could repeatedly measure the collision
model trajectories without altering the mean dynamics.
It should be noted that by this procedure we obtain tra-
jectories for two qubit states, namely a repeated mea-
surement up to step k results in a conditional state on
HS ⊗ He,k.

After discussing the potential generality of the collision

III. COLLISION MODEL DESCRIPTION FOR
TIME CONTINUOUS AMPLITUDE DAMPING

tem to a structured reservoir can be described with the

where st is a time dependent shift on the transition en-
ergy of the two level system and γt is a time dependent
decay rate which may be temporarily negative. Functions
st and γt are related to the zero temperature bath cor-
relation function χt,s [6, 25]. The solution of the master
equation can be given as

ρt ≡Φ(c)

t ρ = ρ11|ηt|2|1(cid:105)(cid:104)1| + (1 − ρ11|ηt|2)|0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|

where |ηt|2 ∈ [0, 1]. The time dependent function
ηt satisﬁes the following diﬀerential equation ˙ηt =
0 ds χt−sηs and initial condition η0 = 1. λ is an
additional parameter for the coupling strength between
system and the environment. The resulting dynamical
map Φt describes amplitude damping with a time depen-
dent parameter |ηt|2 [26].
The two times map Φ(c)

One sees that this is again an amplitude damping channel
|2 ∈ [0, 1]. We denote by Mt+s,t the Choi matrix
iﬀ | ηt+s
of the map Φt+s,t [27]. From Mt+s,t we see that Φt+s,t
is completely positive when |ηt+s|2 ≤ |ηt|2. Thus the dy-
namical map is indivisible whenever the above condition
is violated. This corresponds to a temporarily negative
decay rate γt in the master equation (4) which corre-
sponds to d

dt|ηt|2 > 0 [28].

To fully specify the considered model, we take the spec-
tral density of the reservoir to be a single Lorentzian
leading to an exponential bath correlation function χt =
2 e−Γt−iΩt, t ≥ 0. From now on, with the exception of
Γ

Sec. V A 1, we will use dimensionless units

To use collision model (3) to simulate discontinuously
the map (5) we require that at the nth step the dis-
crete collision model dynamics approximates the time-
continuous dynamics given by Eq. (5), ie. Φn ≈ Φ(c)
τ =nδτ .
First of all, the environment is taken to consist of qubits,
ie. He,i = C2, and all environment qubits are initially
prepared to be in their ground state, |0i(cid:105). As before, we
take the interaction between the system and environment
qubits to be Wi, see Eq. (1). We also choose the interac-
tion between the environment qubits to be similar to Wi
but with independent parametrization

Lastly, we choose U0 = I. The collision model is conve-
niently parametrized with parameters (g, G, φ).

We set ρ to be the initial state of the system qubit. By
plugging in Vi,i−1, Wi and U0 to Eq. (3) we ﬁnd that the
state of the system qubit, ρn after n collisions is

ρn =Φn(ρ) = ρ11|ηn|2|1(cid:105)(cid:104)1| + (1 − ρ11|ηn|2)|0(cid:105)(cid:104)0|

which shows that the collision model dynamics for the
system qubit is of amplitude damping type. The discrete
function ηn satisﬁes the following equation

the collision model that propagates information from the
past collisions.

The only question that

the time-
continuous limit of the collision model dynamics given by
Eqs. (3),(11), and (12) corresponds to the time continu-
ous amplitude damping dynamics of Eqs. (5),(9). Clearly,
if ηn coincides with ητ in some limit the answer is aﬃrma-
tive. We ﬁnd that by choosing the parameters (g, G, φ)
of the collision model as

This choice of relation between parameters (g, G, φ) and
(δτ, ˜λ, ˜Ω) emerges for ﬁxed ˜λ by assuming that g ∝ δτ
and then demanding that ηn+1−ηn
converges to Eq. (8)
in the limit δτ → 0. For the proof see Appendix A.

IV. COMPARISON OF TIME CONTINUOUS

AND COLLISION MODEL DYNAMICS

In this section we compare the continuous in time and
collision model with each other in the case of amplitude
damping dynamics for the system qubit. We discuss their
diﬀerences in terms of divisibility or non-Markovianity.
For simplicity we study only the resonant case, ie. we set
˜Ω = 0 for the rest of this section. From Eq. (14) follows
that φ = π/2.

Amplitude damping in the collision model is deter-
mined by the function ηn. From Eq. (12) we see that
we reach all possible values of the function ηn when

5

The negativity condition of the Choi matrices Mn+1,n
in the time-discrete and Mτ +δτ,τ in the time-continuous
cases is

|ηn+1|2 >|ηn|2,
|ητ +δτ|2 >|ητ|2.

(19)

(20)

These are the conditions for the non-complete positivity
of the associated two times maps. We know that the
time-continuous model is indivisible when ˜λ > 1/2 [28].
In Fig. 4 we have plotted the boundary ˜λ = 1/2 on set
S=0.01 with a solid gray line. Above this line the col-
lision model dynamics is indivisible. In Fig. 5 we have
plotted the image of S=0.01 under the mapping (17)(18)
with dark gray non-solid lines. The dotted dark gray
line is the image of the boundary (g, G)|g=. Solid gray
line is the boundary ˜λ = 1/2 between the divisible and
indivisible dynamics. Light gray non-solid lines are the
boundaries of the set S=0.005. One sees how the con-
tinuous limit δτ → 0 is obtained by letting g → 0 for a
ﬁxed ˜λ. Colored data points in both ﬁgures correspond to
non-Markovianity of the dynamics for n = 30 collisions,
which we will discuss next.

B. Non-Markovianity

Various diﬀerent criteria for non-Markovian open sys-
tem dynamics have been proposed in the literature re-
cently, [16, 29–35]. For further detail see a recent review
article [36]. In this work we use the measure proposed in
[30] which is based on contractivity of the trace distance
under positive maps [37]. For an application of this non-
Markovianity measure to time-discrete dynamics, see for
example [38].
Let D = 1

2|ρ(1) − ρ(2)| be the trace distance between

two quantum states.
In the time continuous case the
measure for non-Markovianity is given as an optimization
over initial state pairs that maximize the time intervals
of trace distance increase during some evolution interval
τ(cid:48) ∈ [τ0, τ ]. It can be expressed as

Nτ = max{ρ(i)}

˙D(τ(cid:48))≥0

˙D(τ(cid:48))dτ(cid:48).

(21)

(cid:90)

(cid:88)

It has been shown that the optimal state pair is orthogo-
nal [39]. Crucial diﬀerence between time-continuous dy-
namics and collision model dynamics is that in the latter
case the derivative of the trace distance does not exist.
Therefore the measure in the time-discrete setting for
k ∈ [0, n] is given by

Nn = max{ρ(i)}

D(k+1)−D(k)>0

D(k + 1) − D(k).

(22)

For the special case studied here we can express the
trace distance between two initial states ρ(1), ρ(2) under

Figure 3.

Markovian evolution and ˜λ = 5 to non-Markovian evolution
of the open system. Other parameters are δτ = 0.02˜λ−1 and
˜Ω = 0. Collision model parameters G, g and φ are obtained
using Eqs. (13)-(15).

g, G ∈ [0, 2π). The absolute value |ηn| is symmetric with
respect to reﬂections of both g, G with respect to π/2.
Therefore we deﬁne the domain S of the collision model
parameters to be

(g, G) ∈ S = [0 + , π/2 − ) × [0 + , π/2 − ),

(16)
where  (cid:28) 1. Equations (13)-(15) give the transforma-
tion between the parameters ( ˜Ω, ˜λ, δτ ) and (G, g, φ). The
inverse transformation is

δτ = ln(1/ sin G),

˜λ =

2g2

ln(1/ sin G)2 .

(17)

(18)

The inverse function theorem states that the transforma-
tion (g, G, φ) (cid:55)→ (δτ, ˜λ, ˜Ω) is invertible apart from some
neighborhood of the singular point δτ = 0. Since the
parameters of the collision model and the time continu-
ous model are in one-to-one correspondence, we can re-
parametrize ηn in terms of ˜λ, δτ and identify time step n
with a time nδτ = τ in the time continuous model. We
can thus write ηn ≡ η(g,G)

≡ ηnδτ = ητ .

A. Divisibility

Open system dynamics is called indivisible in the time-
continuous case if the two times map Φ(c)
τ +τ(cid:48),τ is not com-
pletely positive, where τ, τ(cid:48) > 0.
In the time-discrete
case the deﬁnition is that the map is indivisible if Φm+n,n
is not completely positive. Both maps are indivisible if
the associated Choi matrix is not positive. We denote
the time-continuous and the time-discrete Choi matrices
with Mτ +τ(cid:48),τ and Mm+n,n, respectively.

Pauli matrices. The time-continues case is obtained by
replacing the discrete index n with a continuous param-
eter τ . We know that for this case the optimal pair
of initial states is any pair of states on the equator of
the Bloch sphere [40]. We choose the initial state pair
(|0(cid:105) ± |1(cid:105)) in order to obtain sim-
to be |ϕ±(cid:105) = 1√
ple expression for the trace distance evolution between
the optimal pair; D∗(n) = |ηn|
in the discrete case
and D∗(τ ) = |ητ| in the time continuous case. Since
D∗(τ + δτ )− D∗(τ ) = |ητ +δτ|−|ηδτ| we can deduce that
whenever |ητ| behaves non-monotonically between sub-
sequent steps it is a signature of non-Markovianity of the
dynamics. This observation explains why the deﬁnition
S in Eq. (16) is reasonable. By recalling Eq. (19) we
see that for this speciﬁc system the indivisibility of the
two times map Φn+1,n implies the non-Markovianity of
the dynamics. This is seen also in Figs. 4 and 5, where
non-Markovianity occurs in the regions of indivisibility.
In Fig. 4 we chose 14 400 pairs of values for (g, G) ∈ S,
where  = 0.01 and calculated the non-Markovianity of
the collision model dynamics using the optimal initial
pair for n = 30 collisions. In this ﬁgure we also plotted
the boundary between divisible and indivisible dynamics,
˜λ = 1/2 of the continuous in time model. We see that
the non-Markovianity of the collision model dynamics oc-
curs in the region of indivisibility of the time-continuous
model. Small inconsistencies are due to numerical inaccu-
racies. Nonzero value for  is chosen to avoid divergences.
From the ﬁgure we see that by increasing the value of G,
the strength of the environment particle coupling Vi,i−1,
the dynamics becomes more non-Markovian.

In Fig. 5 we mapped the non-Markovianity values to
(δτ, ˜λ) coordinates using Eqs. (17) and (18). We also
mapped the boundaries of the region S for  = 0.01
with dark gray non-solid lines and for  = 0.005 with
light-gray non-solid lines. Solid gray line is the boundary
˜λ = 1/2. There are regions the image of S=0.01 such
that ˜λ > 1/2 that do not show non-Markovianity. These
emerge because the number of collisions n = 30 is too
small for the ﬁrst revival of |ηnδτ| to occur.

Interestingly, in the case of amplitude damping dy-

of the collision model dynamics to the indivisibility of
the map Φ(c)

˜D(k + 1)− ˜D(k) = |ηk+1|2 −|ηk|2. This just the possibly
negative eigenvalue of the Choi matrix Mk+1,k. Now, by

We have thus shown that in this case the discrete non-
Markovian dynamics provides us information about the
indivisibility properties of the time-continuous dynamical
map.

V. MARKOVIAN EMBEDDING OF

NON-MARKOVIAN DYNAMICS

It is well known in the classical case that non-
Markovian processes can be embedded into Markovian
processes in an extended state space. This can also be
done in the quantum case, a prime example being the
pseudomode method [6] where the indivisible dynamics
of the system of interest is obtained by partial trace from
a state of a larger system that obeys the GKSL mas-
ter equation. In this section we study the possibility to
embed the class of collisional models presented schemati-
cally in Fig. 2 when the open system and the environment
consists of qubits.

The relevant Hilbert space for the bipartite state after
n collisions is HS⊗He,n. This Hilbert space is isomorphic
to HS ⊗He,1. We can use swap operators Sk,l that swap
the states between the environment particle k and l to
implement this isomorphism

The beneﬁt of writing the collision model this way is
that now the system qubit always interacts with the
ﬁrst environment particle which we will call ancilla from
now on. Non-Markovian dynamics of the system qubit
might be possible to embed into Markovian dynam-
ics for the enlarged qubit+ancilla system. Circuit dia-
gram for the collision model with ancilla qubit is pre-
sented in Fig. 6. Clearly, the map Λ can be written
also as Λκn = trn−1{Sn,1W1Sn,1Vn,n−1κn−1(|ϕ(cid:105)(cid:104)ϕ| ⊗

A. Embedding collisional amplitude damping

dynamics

The map Λ does not depend on the step numbers since we
assume that the collision model is homogeneous. Then
clearly the state κn can be written as κn = Λn−1κ1,
where Λk = Λ ◦ Λk−1. The structure of the collision
model however gives a very special form for the initial
state κ1 of the enlarged dynamics, especially it might
be an entangled state between the system and the ﬁrst
environment qubit.

From this follows our ﬁrst non-trivial observation. The
map Λ is not necessarily completely positive since it is
obtained from tracing over (n − 1)th qubit which might
be entangled with the system qubit. However it is easy
to see that the κn is a valid state since the map Λ is
positive and trace preserving. Thus we have at least a

We take Wi from Eq. (1) and Vi,i−1 from Eq. (10). We
assume that initially the system qubit can be in an arbi-
trary pure state and ancilla qubit is in its ground state.
Equation (28) then gives the initial state κ1, the explicit
form for the initial state can be found in Appendix B.
From the initial condition and from the conservation of
the excitation number we can deduce that (cid:104)11| κn |11(cid:105) =
(cid:104)11| κn |10(cid:105) = (cid:104)11| κn |01(cid:105) = (cid:104)11| κn |00(cid:105) = (cid:104)00| κn |11(cid:105) =
(cid:104)01| κn |11(cid:105) = (cid:104)10| κn |01(cid:105) = 0. Thus the dynamics is
conﬁned in to a subspace {|10(cid:105) ,|01(cid:105) ,|00(cid:105)} where the ﬁrst
index is for the system and the second for the ancilla.

The map Λ is not necessarily completely positive as
discussed earlier since the state κ1 is entangled. The
reader may ﬁnd the map Λ written explicitly in the ba-

from the Kraus theorem that if we can write the map in

map is completely positive and trace preserving [26]. The
search of the Kraus operators is non-trivial because of the
correlated initial state [41, 42]. However, the fact that the

proach does not mean that they do not necessarily exist
for this map [43].

Luckily, in this case we can ﬁnd the Kraus decompo-

and where s = sin g, S = sin G, c = cos g and C = cos G.

As we can see from Eqs. (31) and (32) operator B2
acts trivially on one dimensional subspace Hg spanned
by |00(cid:105) and creates linear combinations in the subspace
He spanned by |10(cid:105) , |01(cid:105). B1 is just a transition opera-
tor from He to Hg. Naming of these subspaces reﬂects
the physical picture of a dissipative process where exci-
tation resides in the two qubit system if the state lies in
a subspace He and the excitation has dissipated to the
environment if the state of the two qubit system is in
Hg. Naturally, since we are dealing with quantum sys-
tems the state could be a superposition state of vectors
in Hg and He.

Indeed, the initial state κ1 is of the superposition form.
Namely, κ1 = |ψ(cid:105)(cid:104)ψ|, where |ψ(cid:105) = c0 |00(cid:105)+c1(cos g |01(cid:105)−
i sin g |10(cid:105)), see Appendix B. For future reference we write
| ˜ψ1(cid:105) = g1 |00(cid:105)+α1 |01(cid:105)+β1 |10(cid:105) ≡ |ψ(cid:105). Symbol | ˜ϕ(cid:105) is used
to denote that vector ϕ is not necessarily normalized to

with initial conditions ξ1 = c0, α1 = c1 cos g and β1 =

By tracing out the environment qubit from κn and by
using the amplitude damping channel structure of the
map Φn we can write the function ηn in terms of colli-
sion model as ηn = αn/(c1c∗
0). Then from the recursion
relations (34),(35) we obtain Eq. (12) for the function ηn.

1. Continuous limit of Λn

Note that in this section we will use physical units, eg.
(t, Γ, Ω, λ), since the discussion in this section becomes
most natural by this choice. Map Λ describes discrete
Markovian dynamics. We expect that the continuous
limit is given by a dynamical semigroup eLt. For a small
time interval δt we can use the dynamical semigroup to
write κn+1 ≈ κn + δtLκn. Then we demand that to ﬁrst
order in δt we have

(I + δtL)κn =Λκn.

(37)

It turns out that the continuous limit of Λ is given by

the following Lindblad master equation

Lκ = − i(cid:0) [ασ+σ− ⊗ I + βI ⊗ σ+σ−, κ]
+ δ [σ+ ⊗ σ− + σ− ⊗ σ+, κ](cid:1)

− γ ({I ⊗ σ+σ−, κ} + 2I ⊗ σ−κI ⊗ σ+) ,

(38)

where α, β, δ and γ are free parameters.

By choosing the δt dependence of the collision model
parameters as in Eqs. (13)-(15) and then by expanding by
expanding the state Λκ to ﬁrst order in δt and comparing
to (I + δtL)κ we obtain the following conditions for the
free parameters: α = 0, β = Ω, δ =
2 and γ = Γ.
What we have obtained is that in the continuous limit
the generator of the two qubit dynamics is given by

We can identify this as the pseudomode master equation
for the spontaneously decaying two level system when the
environment is initially in the zero temperature vacuum
state [6].

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have studied the possibility to use col-
lisional models for studying indivisible quantum dynam-
ics and non-Markovianity. We proposed in Sec. II 2 a
collisional model that shows potential for constructing
indivisible dynamical maps.

We also showed in Sec. III that our model can be used
to simulate the process of spontaneous decay of a two
level system to a structured reservoir, which leads to am-
plitude damping, exactly. We discussed in Sec. IV the
non-Markovianity of the collision model dynamics which
is discrete in time and its relation to the indivisibility of
the time-continuous dynamical map.

In Sec. V A we showed how one can distinguish a par-
ticular environment particle and interpret it as a pseu-
domode. We also showed how this leads to positively
divisible dynamics for the combined bipartite system.
We studied in detail the case of amplitude damping and
found out that in the time continuous limit we obtain the
well known pseudomode master equation.

We can conclude that the collision model approach
shows great potential for studying quantum memory ef-
fects in open quantum system dynamics. They might
open a way to study continuous monitoring of the open
system in the case where the dynamical map is indivisi-
ble. Clearly, a very wide open question is what properties
are generally required for the operators Wi and Vi,i−1 so
that the collision model dynamics is indeed indivisible.

Then we assume that δτ (cid:28) 1 and in Eq. (12) we
use cos2 g ≈ 1, tan2 g ≈ g2. With these the dif-
