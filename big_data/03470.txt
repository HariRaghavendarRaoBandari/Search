Abstract

We continue our investigation of quark conﬁnement using a particular variant of the Cho-Duan-
Ge gauge independent Abelian decomposition. The decomposition splits the gauge ﬁeld into a
restricted Abelian part and a coloured part in a way that preserves gauge covariance. Further-
more the restricted part of the gauge ﬁeld can be divided into a Maxwell term and a topological
term. Previously, we showed that by a particular choice of this decomposition we could fully
describe the conﬁning potential using only the restricted gauge ﬁeld. We proposed that various
topological objects (a form of magnetic monopole) could arise in the restricted ﬁeld which would
drive conﬁnement. Our mechanism does not explicitly refer to a dual Meissner eﬀect, nor does it
use centre vortices. We did not need to gauge ﬁx or introduce any new dynamical ﬁelds.

In this work, we show that if we do gauge ﬁx in addition to performing the Abelian decompo-
sition then it is possible to ensure that the topological part of the restricted ﬁeld fully accounts for
the conﬁning potential. Our relationship is exact: there is no approximation or model involved.
This isolates the objects responsible for conﬁnement from non-conﬁning contributions to the gauge
ﬁeld and allows us to directly search for our proposed topological objects. Using numerical stud-
ies in SU(2), we conﬁrm that our proposed monopoles are present in the ﬁeld, and the winding
number associated with these monopoles is a key factor driving quark conﬁnement.

In SU(2), our monopoles are described by two parameters, which we label as cos 2a and c. We
show that it is possible to re-parametrise the Yang Mills action and the functional integration
measure in terms of these variables (plus the necessary additional parameters). We can thus treat
the monopoles as dynamical variables in the functional integral. This might be the ﬁrst step in a
future analytical computation to complement our numerical results.

1. Introduction

An enduring problem in QCD is to ﬁnd the mechanism which causes quark conﬁnement, which
is known to be non-perturbative in its origin. Although several models have been proposed – for
example, center vortices [1], and a dual Meissner eﬀect due to magnetic monopoles [2, 3, 4, 5] –
there has not yet been a convincing demonstration that any of them are correct. Our work [6, 7]
investigates the Cho-Duan-Ge (CDG) Abelian decomposition (sometimes referred to as the Cho-
Faddeev-Niemi decomposition) [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Unlike Dirac and ’t Hooft (Maximum Abelian
Gauge) monopoles, the CDG decomposition allows for monopole solutions while respecting the
gauge symmetry and does not require a singular gauge ﬁeld or an additional Higgs ﬁeld. The
decomposition is constructed from a colour ﬁeld, n, which may be built from a SU(NC ) matrix
θ, where SU(NC ) is the gauge group of QCD. Each n deﬁnes a diﬀerent decomposition, and
an important question is the best way of choosing this ﬁeld. Recent work [13, 14, 15, 16] has

demonstrated that the magnetic part of the ﬁeld strength dominates the conﬁning string, using a
decomposition constructed from one particular choice of θ ∈ SU (NC )/U (NC − 1); however in this
case only one of the possible NC − 1 types of monopole is visible.
We consider a diﬀerent choice of θ ∈ SU (NC)/(U (1))NC−1. The initial goal of our study was
to investigate whether monopoles apparent in this construction may also lead to conﬁnement1.
Concentrating on the Wilson Loop, an observable used to measure the string tension, we showed
that the path ordering may be removed by diagonalising the gauge links along the Wilson Loop by
an SU (NC)/(U (1))NC−1 ﬁeld θ. This, in principle, allowed us to use Stokes’ theorem to express the
Wilson Loop in terms of a surface integral over an Abelian restricted gauge ﬁeld strength tensor.
We used the CDG decomposition, constructed from a colour ﬁeld nj = θλjθ† for a diagonal
Gell-Mann matrix λj, to ﬁnd a consistent construction of this restricted ﬁeld across space-time,
and not just for those gauge links along the Wilson Loop where it was originally deﬁned. Our
relationship for the string tension in terms of this restricted ﬁeld is exact: we do not require any
approximations or additional path integrals. We also searched for topological structures in the ﬁeld
strength. Among the parameters that deﬁned the θ ﬁeld, one class of them, which we labelled as
ci – one parameter in SU(2), or three parameters in SU(3) – could be split into various homotopy
classes characterised by an integer winding number. This winding number survives smooth gauge
transformations, and most importantly the trace of the Wilson Loop could be shown to depend
explicitly on this winding number. With the number of topological objects contributing to the
winding proportional to the area of the Wilson Loop, this provided a possible mechanism for
quark conﬁnement. We deduced the ﬁeld strengths associated with these topological objects, and
showed that the Yang-Mills ﬁeld strength tensor in restricted lattice QCD showed the expected
structures. However, in our previous numerical work we restricted ourselves to gauge invariant
observables. We showed that the Abelian restricted ﬁeld could exactly account for the conﬁning
potential, but we did not show that the topological term can account for it, in part because this
depends on the gauge.

The problem we faced was that the parameters ai and ci which described the θ ﬁeld are not
gauge invariant – only the winding number survives continuous gauge transformations, and can
be destroyed by a discontinuous transformation. This means that it is necessary to ﬁx the gauge
before measuring these quantities. However it was not clear to us which gauge to ﬁx to. The
issue was that our theoretical formulation is only valid if the θ ﬁeld is smooth and continuous.
In the continuum, this is certainly true in some gauges (one can choose a gauge where θ is a
constant matrix), but not every gauge, and there was no obvious reason why it should be satisﬁed
using the standard Landau or Coloumb gauges. This is even before we encounter the diﬃculty
of deﬁning ‘smooth’ or ‘continuous’ on the lattice. We therefore decided to leave the question of
gauge dependent quantities to one side, and concentrate on gauge invariant quantities such as the
string tension and Field Strength.

However, to demonstrate that our mechanism for conﬁnement is correct, we need to look at the
gauge dependent quantities, and show that in some gauge the winding of ci exists in practice and
can account for the string tension. In this work, we suggest that there is at least one particular
gauge where a) the θ term wholly dominates conﬁnement; b) the θ ﬁeld is smooth; and c) we can
observe the winding and how it can lead to conﬁnement. The question is then whether this picture
survives gauge transformations: we see that the eﬀect of the gauge transformation is just to move
the same topological eﬀects from the topological part of the restricted ﬁeld into the Maxwell part
of the restricted ﬁeld. In other words, the same topology drives conﬁnement in other gauges, but
they are hidden within the gauge ﬁeld Aµ. Another way of expressing what we are proposing is
that we can extract the relevant degrees of freedom that drive conﬁnement through a particular
choice of gauge ﬁxing and Abelian decomposition, and place them in the θ ﬁeld, where they can
be isolated from the rest of the gauge ﬁeld and studied in closer detail.

One other issue that we left undone in our earlier work was the question of the quantum

discussion of the relationship to quark conﬁnement.

theory. In our previous work, we took each gauge conﬁguration individually and examined them
independently. From a lattice ﬁeld theorist used to Monte-Carlo simulations, this is perhaps a
natural way of doing things, but maybe not so much for those used to trying to perform path
integrals analytically. We therefore also give the full quantum formulation of the Yang Mill ﬁelds
in terms of our Abelian decomposition. Our idea is to re-write the path integral in terms of new
ﬁelds, which include those which parametrise the Abelian decomposition and the restricted gauge
ﬁeld (θ and ˆA). Thus the parameters we are studying become dynamical quantum ﬁelds. We
ﬁnd the measure of the path integral by demanding that it is gauge invariant. The corresponding
Yang-Mills action, re-written in terms of the new ﬁelds, shows some interesting features. Most
importantly, we see hints that the same topological solutions that drive the area law for the Wilson
Loop might also lead to a dynamically generated gluon mass. We do not, however, complete this
analysis by constructing gauge invariant states (the glueballs) and measuring their mass spectrum;
this still looks challenging.

In section 2 we brieﬂy review the main theoretical points of our previous work, [6]. In section 3,
we prepare for our discussion of the new formulation of Yang-Mills theory by discussing the gauge
transformations of the θ and restricted ﬁeld, while in section 4 we re-parametrise the Yang-Mills
action to show how our decomposition can be easily visualised within the path integral. In section
5, we discuss our gauge ﬁxing which allows us to isolate the topological objects which dominate
either the Wilson Loop or Polyakov line. In section 6 we show some numerical results in SU(2),
while we conclude in section 7.

Because of the expense of our numerical simulations, in this work we restrict ourselves to the
quicker SU(2) theory. Some of our theoretical results are only given in SU(2), while others we have
derived in both SU(2) and SU(3). The SU(3) theory proceeds in much the same way as SU(2)
– it involves the same concepts, in almost the same way – but the algebra is considerably more
cumbersome. For these reasons we intend to delay our full investigation of SU(3).

2. Abelian Dominace of the Conﬁning Potential

The Wilson Loop in an SU(NC ) gauge theory is deﬁned as

WL[Cs, A] =

1
NC

tr (W [Cs, A])

W [Cs, A] = P[e−ig HCs

dxµAµ(x)]

(1)

for a closed curve Cs of length L which starts and ﬁnishes at a position s, where P represents
path ordering and the gauge ﬁeld, Aµ, can be written in terms of the Gell-Mann matrices, λa, as
1
µλa. We will use the summation convention that the superscripts a, b, . . . on a Gell-Mann matrix
2 Aa
implies that it should be summed over all values of a, λaAa ≡ PN 2
C−1
a=1 λaAa, while the indices
j, k, . . . are restricted only to the diagonal Gell-Mann matrices, so, in the standard representation,
C−1 λj Aj. We shall often leave the gauge ﬁeld dependence of W and WL
Ajλj ≡ Pj=3,8,...,N 2
The Wilson Loop when Cs is an R × T rectangle, with spatial extent R and temporal extent

T , can be used to measure the conﬁning static quark potential, V (R), [18]

implicit.

V (R) = − lim
T→∞

log(hWL[Cs]i)/T,

(2)

where h. . .i denotes the vacuum expectation value. It is expected, and observed in lattice simu-
lations, that for intermediate distances the conﬁning potential is linear in R, so V (R) ∼ ρR + k,
where ρ is the string tension, and k is a constant. At very small distances, the potential is ex-
pected to be Coulomb, while in the presence of fermion loops at very large distances the string is
broken and the potential becomes independent of R [19]. The main focus of this work is on the
intermediate regime, so we expect that the expectation value of the Wilson Loop will scale with
the spatial and temporal extents of the Wilson Loop as

hWL[Cs]i ∼ e−ρRT .

3

(3)

This is known as the area law scaling of the Wilson Loop. As discussed in [6], this is satisﬁed, if
on each individual conﬁguration, the Wilson Loop scales as

WL[Cs] ∼ eiF ,

(4)

where F is randomly distributed from conﬁguration to conﬁguration (according to one of a certain
set of distributions which includes those relevant for this work) with a mean value proportional
to the area contained within the curve Cs. The eventual goal (and this work is intended as a step
towards that goal) is to demonstrate from ﬁrst principles that equation (4) is satisﬁed in pure
gauge QCD (and later full QCD), and thus that the quarks are linearly conﬁned.

A diﬃculty with evaluating equation (1) is the path ordering. If the ﬁelds Aµ(x) at diﬀerent
x and µ commuted with each other, then we could ignore the path ordering, and use Stokes’
theorem to convert the line integral to a surface integral. The problem would then reduce to
showing that there was some ﬂux ﬂowing through the surface so that the surface integral was
proportional to the area (perhaps by counting lines of ﬂux). However, Aµ are non-Abelian ﬁelds:
we cannot immediately do this. Our approach is then ﬁrst to construct an Abelian ﬁeld ˆAµ(x)
so that WL[Cs, ˆA] = WL[Cs, A], and the calculated string tension does not depend on which of
the two ﬁelds we use. We may then remove the path ordering, apply Stokes’ theorem to replace
the line integral with a surface integral over some ﬁeld strength, and then show that the surface
integral is proportional to the area enclosed within the loop.

σ

First we shall deﬁne what is meant by path ordering. We split Cs into inﬁnitesimal segments of
length δσ, and deﬁne the gauge link as Uσ ∈ SU (NC ) = P[e−ig R σ+δσ
Aσ dσ] ∼ e−igδσAσ . 0 ≤ σ ≤ L
represents the position along the curve and we write Aσ ≡ Aµ(σ)(x(σ)). We have assumed and
will require throughout this work that the gauge ﬁeld, A, is diﬀerentiable. This limits us to
only a certain subset of gauges, and once we have found a suitable gauge we are restricted to
continuous gauge transformations, i.e. only those gauge transformations which can be built up
from repeatedly applying inﬁnitesimal gauge transformations, Aµ → Aµ +g−1∂µα+i[α, Aµ], where
α ≡ αaλa and ∂µα are both inﬁnitesimal. We also neglect the eﬀects of the corners of the Wilson
Loop; the discontinuity in Aσ at the corner can, for example, be avoided by using a rounded
corner or particular choices of gauge. The path ordered integral over gauge ﬁelds is deﬁned as the
ordered product of the gauge links around the curve in the limit δσ → 0.

W [Cs] can be written in this lattice representation as

We wish to now replace Uσ by an equivalent Abelian ﬁeld.

W [Cs] = lim
δσ→0

L−δσ

Yσ=0,δσ,2δσ,...

Uσ.

(5)

We introduce a ﬁeld θσ ≡ θ(x(σ)), which, for the moment, we shall take to be an element of
U(NC ), at each location along Cs and insert the identity operator θσθ†σ between each of the gauge
links. θ is chosen so that θ†σUσθσ+δσ is diagonal. There are L/δσ gauge links along the path, and
we introduce L/δσ θ ﬁelds, so there is no obvious reason why the system cannot be solved. In
fact, it is easy to construct a solution: it is easy to show (the proof is given in [6]) that θs contains
the eigenvectors of W [Cs]: W [Cs]θs = θsei Pλj diagonal ρj λj

, for some real ρj.

As the phases of the eigenvectors are arbitrary, this deﬁnition only determines θ up to a
(U (1))NC transformation θ → θχ. χ makes no diﬀerence to any physical observable, but for prac-
tical purposes it is useful to select the phases and ordering of the eigenvectors by some arbitrary ﬁx-
ing condition to give a unique choice of θ ∈ SU (NC)/(U (1))NC−1. We deﬁne SU (NC)/(U (1))NC−1
by considering the following parametrisation of a U (N ) matrix:

ai, ci, d0 and dj are real parameters, and there are NC(NC − 1)/2 Givens matrices (i.e. one for
each of the possible ways of embedding a 2 × 2 matrix into a NC × NC matrix) parametrised by
one particular a and c. An SU (NC)/(U (1))NC−1 matrix is parametrised in the same way, but
without the ﬁnal (U (1))NC term (i.e. by setting dj and d0 to some arbitrary ﬁxed value, most
conveniently dj = d0 = 0).

Under a gauge transformation, Uσ → ΛσUσΛ†σ+δσ for Λ = eilaλa

∈ SU (NC), θ → Λθχ,
where the (U (1))NC−1 factor χ depends on the ﬁxing condition (in this case Λθ ∈ SU (N ) so
there is no contribution to χ from d0). This follows from the deﬁnition of θ as containing the
eigenvectors of the Wilson Loop. The Wilson Loop transforms under a gauge transformation
as W [Cs, U ] → ΛsW [Cs, U ]Λ†s, so the operator which diagonalises it transforms according to
θs → Λsθs; although we also need to reselect the U (1)NC−1 factor so that the ﬁxing condition
remains satisﬁed. With θ†σUσθσ+δσ = ei Pλj diagonal δσuj λj

removing the non-Abelian structure and the path ordering without introducing an additional path
integral.

Our goal is to apply Stokes’ theorem to convert this line integral into a surface integral, and
this requires extending the deﬁnition of θ and uj across the surface bounded by Cs. In practice, we
construct these ﬁelds across all of space time. To generalise θ, we construct nested curves, Ci, in
the same plane as Cs and then stack these rectangles on top of each other in the other dimensions,
so that every location in Euclidean space-time is contained within one and only one curve. We
then deﬁne θ so it diagonalises the gauge links (and only these gauge links) which contribute to
W [Ci, U ].

We cannot naively extend uj across all of space-time, because its deﬁnition requires that all
the gauge links U are diagonalised by θ, not just those that contribute to the Wilson Loop, and
in general this cannot be satisﬁed. Instead, we replace the gauge links U with a ﬁeld ˆU , deﬁned
in a consistent way so that it is both diagonalised by θ across all of space time, and equal to U
along the path Cs. The ﬁrst of these conditions means that

[λj , θ†x

ˆUµ,xθx+ˆµδσ] =0,

for each diagonal λj, which can be re-written in the form

ˆUµ,xnj

x+δσ ˆµ

ˆU†µ,x − nj

x =0

nj
x ≡θxλjθ†x.

(8)

(9)

This condition is satisﬁed across all of space-time and for all directions µ. Note that nj is inde-
pendent of the choice of χ. As we shall see later, the θ-dependence of the restricted ﬁeld strength
Fµν [ ˆA] only appears within nj, and objects contributing to the restricted ﬁeld strength drive con-
ﬁnement. This is the justiﬁcation of our earlier statement that the choice of χ does not aﬀect the
physical observable, which is the restricted ﬁeld strength. To give this ˆU ﬁeld a physical meaning
we need to relate it to the gauge ﬁeld U , and we do so via a second ﬁeld ˆX deﬁned according to

For later convenience (equation (29)), we restrict ˆXµ by imposing the condition

ˆXµ(x) = Uµ(x) ˆU†µ(x).

Under a gauge transformation n transforms as nx → ΛxnxΛ†x (which follows from the transfor-
mation rule for θ) and the requirement that equations (9) and (11) are satisﬁed in every gauge
leads to the transformation rules ˆUµ(x) → Λx ˆUµ,xΛ†x+ˆµδσ and ˆXµ,x → Λx ˆXµ,xΛ†x. Equations
(9) and (11) are the lattice versions of the deﬁning equations of the gauge independent CDG

Equation (12) is the naive continuum limit of equation (10); equations (13) and (15) are the
naive continuum limit of equation (9), and equation (14) is the continuum limit of equation (11).
Proof that equation (16) solves the continuum decomposition has previously been given in (for
example) [6, 8, 9, 13].

The condition (11) may then be interpreted as requiring that tr(nj ˆA) = tr(nj A), the component
of the gauge ﬁeld A parallel to n is fully contained within ˆA. In the continuum, the solution for ˆA
and X is unique, but on the lattice we found that there were sometimes several distinct solutions
to equations (9) and (11).
In this case, we choose the solution which had the largest value of
tr( ˆX), a condition which is both gauge invariant and satisﬁed along Cs where ˆU = U and thus
ˆX = 1.

The continuum deﬁning equations ensure that the ﬁeld strength ˆFµν associated with ˆA, deﬁned

by

[Dµ[ ˆA], Dν[ ˆA]]α = −ig[ ˆFµν[ ˆA], α]

(18)

for any ﬁeld α in the adjoint representation of the gauge group, satisﬁes ˆFµν [ ˆA] = βj
µνnj for some
real scalars βj. The proof of this follows by substituting each of the nj ﬁelds in turn in place of
α, using equation (13) to show that [ ˆF , nj] = 0 for all the nj, and noting that the only objects
which commute with each of the nj are proportional to the other nj ﬁelds.

We express the restricted ﬁeld as ˆUµ,x ≡ θxeiλj δσ ˆuj

2The original discoverers of this decomposition prefer to call it a gauge independent decomposition rather than
gauge invariant decomposition. In these earlier models, the choice of θ was left arbitrary. The procedure was to
ﬁx to some arbitrary gauge, and then select some θ. Since the decomposition only depends on the choice of θ, and
proceeds regardless of which gauge was originally chosen, the decomposition was referred to as gauge independent
to distinguish it from other approaches which required ﬁxing to particular gauges, such as the decomposition based
on the Maximum Abelian Gauge. Our work diﬀers in philosophy from the original approach because we do not
need to perform any gauge ﬁxing to extract our observables, since our key quantities (such as the ﬁeld strength
and Wilson Loop) are gauge covariant and thus the corresponding observables are gauge invariant. However, our
particular choice of θ is gauge dependent, and thus the quantities which we use to parametrise it can only be
examined after gauge ﬁxing to some arbitrary gauge. The authors of
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12] gauge ﬁxed to an arbitrary
gauge and then performed an Abelian decomposition; we decompose and then (if required, which isn’t the case for
any physical observable) gauge ﬁx.

tr(njgAµ + iλjθ†∂µθ).

(21)

This expression contains two terms. The ﬁrst, which we call the Maxwell term, is proportional to
tr(njAµ) and depends on both θ and the gauge ﬁeld directly. The second we call the topological
or θ term, is proportional to trλj θ†∂µθ, and is only a function of the θ ﬁeld, and the gauge ﬁeld
indirectly through θ.

We can now consider the Wilson Line around an inﬁnitesimal plaquette p, which for a smooth

ˆu ﬁeld gives

which leads to

W [p, ˆU ] = ˆUx,µ ˆUx+δσ ˆµ,ν ˆU†x+δσˆν,µ

ˆU†x,ν = ei ˆFµν ,

W [p, θ† ˆU θ] = eiλj (∂µ ˆuj

(22)

(23)

and building the integral over the surface bounded by Cs from the product of integrals over these
small plaquettes, using that the exponent is Abelian, gives equations (19) and (20).

Finally, as alluded to earlier, we note that ˆFµν [ ˆA] can be written in the forms

ˆFµν [ ˆA] =

(25)

as is proved in [6]. These functions solely depend on n, and θ only indirectly through n, and since
n is independent of χ and ˆF is the physical observable we want to study, we conclude that the
choice of χ will not aﬀect any of the physical observables we need.

Equation (19) is only valid if ˆu is diﬀerentiable. Equation (19) is also similar to what we see
in QED, which is, of course, not conﬁning. In analogy to QED, we may expect the contribution
of those portions of space time where ˆu is continuous to have little contribution to the string
tension. However, we must also add to this equation the eﬀects of discontinuities in ˆu. We do so
by only extending the area integral over those areas where ˆu is continuous, and add additional
line integrals around the areas where it is discontinuous. The linear string tension will, at least
in part, arise from these discontinuities. Since ˆuj is built from the gauge ﬁeld and θ, and we
are working on a gauge where the gauge ﬁeld is assumed to be diﬀerentiable, we must therefore
consider whether θ is diﬀerentiable.

In practice, we found that non-analyticities in θ occurred when the gauge ﬁeld was not dif-
ferentiable, when the Wilson Loop had non degenerate eigenvalues, and when ai = 0 or π/2.
It was this last part which interested us, because at these points the parameter c is undeﬁned.
This means that in principle, ci can wind around these points. Since eici must be a continuous
function of position if the θ ﬁeld is smooth, this means that as we transverse a closed path ci
can only change by an integer multiple of 2π. These factors of 2π can only emerge at the ai = 0
or π/2 discontinuities. We expect the number of these discontinuities to be proportional to the
area contained within the curve, since they might appear at any point in space time. When we
convert from a line integral to a surface integral bound by the closed loop via Stokes’ theorem,
each of these objects contributes to the Abelian restricted ﬁeld strength, and thus we can also
consider the Wilson Loop as the sum of these contributions. The ﬁeld strength associated with
these discontinuities (in four dimensional space time) is not point-like, but extends in lines of high
electric or magnetic ﬁeld, meaning that it is impossible to evade these objects by distorting the
surface bounded by the curve.

Another way of seeing how the winding number contributes to the path integral is to expand

θ†∂µθ in terms of the parameters a and c. In SU(2) we ﬁnd,

θ†∂σθ = i∂σaφ + i sin a cos a ¯φ∂σc − i sin2 a∂σcλ3,

2 (1 − cos 2a) we ﬁnd that this term contributes H dxµ

This sin2 a∂σc term is what we believe generates quark conﬁnement. When we integrate this
around the curve, it will contain a term proportional to the winding number νc. For example,
writing sin2 a = 1
2 (1 − cos 2a)∂µc = πνc −

2H dxµ cos 2a ∂µc to the Wilson Loop. The ﬁrst term is proportional to the winding number; the
second is harder to analyse: if the distributions of a and c around the loop were independent of
each other distributed around the loop, then on average this second term would give πνchcos 2ai,
also proportional to the winding number; but in practice this analysis is likely to be too naive,
since the winding is generated at points where cos 2a = ±1.
Suppose that ˆuj contains a non-analyticity. We integrate the ﬁeld around a loop ˜C parametrised
by ˜σ surrounding the discontinuity, bounding the surface integral by an additional line integral
˜σ is analytic along ˜C. We deﬁne { ˜Cn} as
the set of curves surrounding all these discontinuities, and ˜Σ the area bound within these curves.
We can write

Using (11) the ﬁrst term in equation (29) gives zero, while the second term will not contribute

3. Gauge transformations

A gauge transformation can be parametrised as

Uµ(x) → ΛxUµ(x)Λ†x+ǫˆµ,

(31)

where Λ is an element of SU(N ). For the inﬁnitesimal transformation, Λ ∼ eilaλa
this corresponds
to the usual gauge transformation rule gAµ → gAµ + ∂µl − i[l, gAµ] with l = laλa and Uµ(x) ∼
e−igAµ(x)δx. We can also write (if the lattice spacing is small enough and the ﬁelds suﬃciently
smooth) gAµ → gΛxAµΛ†x + iΛ∂µΛ†.
means that under a gauge transformation θ transforms as

θ → Λθeiδj λj ,

(32)

where δj are chosen to re-project θ into the required format. This means that ˆu transforms as

µ =tr(nj gAµ + iλjθ†∂µθ)
→tr(ΛnjΛ†(gΛAµΛ† + iΛ∂µΛ†) + iλj(e−iδkλk

=tr(nj (gAµ) + iλjθ†∂µθ) − 2∂µδj

θ†Λ†∂µ(Λθeiδkλk

(33)

Thus we have ˆuj

µ → ˆuj

µ + ∂µδj, as we would expect for an Abelian ﬁeld.

Note, however, that neither the Maxwell term contribution nor the topological contribution to

ˆu (and thus ˆA) are by themselves gauge invariant. Indeed, the Maxwell term transforms to

while the topological term transforms to

tr(nj(gAµ)) → tr(nj(gAµ + i∂µ(Λ†)Λ))

tr(iλj(θ†∂µθ)) → tr(iλj (θ†∂µθ + θ†Λ†∂µ(Λ)θ)).

4. Re-parametrisation of the Yang-Mills action.

(34)

(35)

We seek to explicitly provide a path integral formulation of this decomposition. The ﬁrst step
is to re-write the path integral in terms of the variables a, c and d used to parametrise the Abelian
decomposition, plus the remaining variables required to describe the other gauge ﬁelds. We begin
by writing the lattice gauge links as

where (in SU(2)),

Uµ,x = ˜θµ,xe−iǫ∂µ ˜dj

µλj ˜θ†µ,x+ǫˆµ,

˜θµ,x =(cid:18)

cos ˜aµ

i sin ˜aµe−i˜cµ

i sin ˜aµei˜cµ

cos ˜aµ

(cid:19)

(36)

(37)

The corresponding object in higher gauge groups can be constructed in analogy to the prescription
in equation (6). There are (N 2− N )/2 ˜aµ and ˜cµ parameters per ˜θ ﬁeld, and N − 1 ˜dj
µ parameters,
so the total number of variables described by this theory is the expected N 2 − 1 per lattice site
per direction (we have not yet gauge ﬁxed). Note that, despite the notation, ˜cµ, ˜aµ and ˜dj
µ are
not four vectors since they do not transform canonically under Lorentz transformations.

We can ﬁnd the measure for the path integral through the requirement that it should be gauge
invariant. This is the same requirement that leads to the standard Haar measure in lattice gauge
theory.

We can easily express the variables a and c which parametrise the Abelian decomposition in
terms of these parameters. The easiest example is when we are investigating the Polyakov Loop.
Here we just identify ˜θˆt,x ≡ θx, where θx is the Abelian decomposition θ matrix, and the ﬁrst index
in ˜θ indicates the direction and the second the location. This implies that ˆXˆt = 1, and the deﬁning
equations of the Abelian decomposition are then automatically satisﬁed in that direction. For the
Wilson Loop, we need to switch from a Cartesian coordinate system. Instead, when considering
Wilson Loops in the xt plane, we use the direction index µ = 0 to indicate those links that lie
along the various nested Wilson Loops, and µ = 1 to indicate the other gauge links in the xt
plane. µ = 2 and µ = 3 then represent the Cartesian y and z directions respectively as usual. In
this case we can identify θ0,x ≡ θx, and once again this allows us to write the parameters in the
Abelian decomposition as dynamical variables.
For most of the following, we will use the Polyakov Loop, i.e. straight Cartesian, representation
of the gauge links, as this is easier and we do not have to worry about eﬀects from the corners of
the Wilson Loop. This choice does not aﬀect the computation of the measure, but does inﬂuence
our expression for the ﬁeld strength tensor.

with l3, l1, l2 and Λa, Λb and Λd inﬁnitesimal. The parametrisation in terms of Λx is easier to
work with, though obviously these Λx are going to be functions of a, c, d so we will have to convert
back to the lx formulation of the gauge transformation at the end of the calculation. In fact, we
ﬁnd (up to terms of O(l2) or O(Λ2))

l3 =Λd
l1 =Λa cos ˜cµ,x − Λb sin ˜cµ,x
l2 =Λa sin ˜cµ,x + Λb cos ˜cµ,x

Λa =l1 cos ˜cµ,x + l2 sin ˜cµ,x
Λb = − l1 sin ˜cµ,x + l2 cos ˜cµ,x.

˜c′µ,x =˜cµ,x + ˜d′µ,x − ˜dµ,x + Λb cot ˜aµ,x = ˜cµ,x + l3 + (l1 sin ˜cµ,x − l2 cos ˜cµ,x)(tan ˜aµ,x − cot ˜aµ,x).

from which we can see that µ ∝ sin 2˜aµ,x. This means that the ﬁelds at ˜aµ,x = 0 and ˜aµ,x = π/2,
which drive the topological solutions, are suppressed by the measure. This makes sense, because
it allows for a phase transition: if the action (a function of temperature and in full QCD chemical
potential, magnetic ﬁeld, etc.) encourages these solutions, and the measure suppresses them, then
there might well be some temperature (and chemical potential and magnetic ﬁeld etc.) which
changes from the suppression being more signiﬁcant to the encouragement being most important,
leading to a conﬁnement or de-conﬁnement transition. We can construct a lattice theory by
taking the continuum theory and super-imposing a lattice on top of it. Thus the value of ˜aµ,x
on a particular lattice sites could be the continuum value at that particular location. On such a
lattice theory, we will not get exactly ˜aµ,x = 0 or ˜aµ,x = π/2, but merely something close to it
the lattice site surrounding the point in the continuum theory where ˜aµ = 0. Suppose that we
have a lattice spacing ǫ, and a point around which there is winding (˜aµ = 0) somewhere on the
continuum: this will fall inside a 1 × 1 square of gauge links on the lattice. Thus to have winding,
we need in practice to have four neighbouring gauge links of the order of ∂2
ν ˜aµǫ2, since we can
expect ∂ν ˜aµ = 0 near the minimum or maximum value of aµ if we choose a continuous θ. Ignoring
the gauge action for simplicity, the measure term tells us that the number of lattice sites with this
ν ˜aµǫ2)2 multiplied by the number of lattice sites. The number of
or smaller ˜aν is 1 − cos 2˜aµ ∼ (∂2
lattice sites in a four dimensional box of ﬁxed physical volume surrounding the singularity scales
with 1/ǫ4, meaning that the number of unit hyper-cubes which contain the point at ˜aµ = 0 will
remain roughly constant as ǫ → 0; the measure suppresses them to the degree that is necessary to
ensure that their number remains stable as the lattice spacing decreases.

Thus the path integral can be written as

Z d[cos 2aµ]d[cµ]d[dµ]e−β Px F 2

µν [˜aµ(x),˜cµ(x), ˜dµ(x)],

(46)

where β is inversely proportional to the square of the gauge coupling, d[f ] represents the functional
integral over f and F 2
µν represents the Yang-Mills action. cos 2˜aµ is bound between −1 and 1, ˜cµ
and ˜dµ can extend over the entire real axis.

4.2. SU(3)

In SU(3), the measure is given by

µ = sin 2˜a1µ,x sin 2˜a2µ,x sin 2˜a3µ,x cos2 ˜a2µ,x.

(47)

The proof is given in appendix A

4.3. Numerical Check of the Measure

We can check that these measures are correct by comparing Monte-Carlo simulations of the
standard parametrisation of lattice QCD and the new one using ˜a, ˜c and ˜d as dynamical variables.
This new formulation of QCD turned out to be considerably slower to compute, because of the
need to continually convert from the gauge links (which we need for the standard Luscher-Weisz
action) and the new parameters. We used a HMC algorithm [20] to generate the gauge ﬁelds,
directly adding the measure term (in SU(2) tr log sin(2˜aµ,x)) to the action. Hybrid Monte-Carlo

Trajectory number

Figure 1: The average plaquette plotted against trajectory number for a standard Lattice QCD HMC simulation
of pure Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory, and with the modiﬁed parametrisation. Trajectory numbers 1-1100 were computed
with the standard formulation of lattice QCD. Trajectory numbers above 1300 were computed with the new for-
mulation of lattice QCD. The thick lines represent the mean value of the plaquette and the 1σ error bars. The ﬁrst
250 trajectories were excluded from the average because the ensemble was still thermalising. The mean value of
the plaquette for the standard HMC run is 0.5547(4), for the modiﬁed HMC 0.5560(5), a discrepancy of less than
2σ.

is a combination of a molecular dynamics evolution of the ﬁelds, introducing a conjugate momen-
tum and then integrating over a classical trajectory (with the QCD action playing the role of
the classical potential energy), which is used to generate a new trail conﬁguration. A Metropolis
accept/reject step is then applied, which ensures that the conﬁgurations will be distributed ac-
cording to the correct distribution. ˜aµ,x is bound between 0 ≤ ˜aµ,x ≤ π/2 so sin(2˜aµ,x) cannot
be negative, and will only be zero at the points which should be forbidden by the action. How-
ever, when ˜a ∼ 0 or ˜a ∼ π/2, log sin 2˜a can become large, which caused instabilities in the HMC
molecular dynamics evolution. To resolve this, we modiﬁed the action for the molecular dynamics
slightly to tr log(sin(2˜aµ,x) + ζ) where ζ is some small tunable parameter. The Metropolis step,
however, used the correct action (which ensures that the whole algorithm generates the desired
distribution). Too small a choice of ζ means that the molecular dynamics becomes unstable, and
the whole Monte Carlo breaks down. Too large a choice of ζ would mean that the molecular
dynamics is no longer close to shadowing the true distribution, and the metropolis algorithm
would reject most of the trail conﬁgurations. The question is then if there is a value of ζ which
lies between these two bounds. We did not encounter any diﬃculties with stability simulating on
lattice sizes of up to 163× 32 in both SU(2) and SU(3); it is possible that diﬃculties might arise on
larger lattice volumes. However, our implementation of this algorithm required considerably more
computer time than the standard lattice Monte-Carlo methods, so for the conﬁgurations used in
section 6 we used the standard lattice QCD Monte-Carlo to generate the conﬁgurations, with the
modiﬁed algorithm using the new dynamical variables only used as a consistency check.

Having generated ensembles with both the standard and this new formulation of lattice QCD,
we can test various observables. We found a good agreement on all those we tested, although we
were restricted to small lattices for these tests so that we could generate enough conﬁgurations with
the new parametrisation. Figure 1 shows the average plaquette Uµν (the path ordered product of
gauge links around a 1 × 1 rectangle; the trace of the plaqutte is a representation of the Yang-
Mills action F 2
µν plus a constant) across our molecular dynamics trajectories for both a standard
lattice simulation and one built from these new variables. We show data from an SU(2) ensemble,
but the situation is similar in SU(3). We observe that there is no noticeable diﬀerence either in
the average plaquette or the variation from the average. The ensemble used a Tadpole Improved
Luscher Wesiz gauge action [21] with β = 3.0 and a lattice size of 63 × 12.

4.4. Abelian Decomposition

As discussed earlier, we identify ˜θµ,x with θx in one direction, and in this direction the Abelian

decomposition is straight forward. In the remaining directions

δ is a parameter which we will have to determine to ensure that the deﬁning equations of the
Abelian decomposition are satisﬁed. We write

(60)

Before constructing the ﬁeld strength tensor, we have one more change of variables to make. The
measure contains d˜aµ sin 2˜aµ; however while this measure is well deﬁned in a lattice theory, is it
diﬃcult to take its continuum limit. We would need to absorb the sin 2˜aµ term into the action
(which is what we did in the lattice simulations), but the products of these terms cannot easily
be expressed in terms of the exponential of an integral over all space. We therefore make the
substitution g ˜yµ = cos 2˜aµ, where g is the Yang-Mills coupling. This has the eﬀect of removing
any complications in the measure. The integration range of the new variable ˜yµ is from −1/g
to 1/g, which, as we approach the continuum limit at the g = 0 ﬁxed point, tends towards the
standard integration range for a Gaussian integral from −∞ to ∞. In these new coordinates, we
have

with all the ﬁelds ˜y, ˜c and ˜d dimensionless; the integrals over ˜cµ and ˜dµ range for all real functions
of these variables; for ˜yµ we are constrained to functions where −1/g ≤ ˜yµ ≤ 1/g. Since all the
terms in Fµν are proportional to a derivative operator, in the absence of any winding the resultant
gauge particles will be massless, as we expect in a QCD-like theory.

4g2 F 2

The lack of any clear quadratic terms in the action 1

µν is discouraging from the perspective
of perturbative calculations. However, in practice we would want to ﬁrst gauge ﬁx and then expand
around a minima of the action when performing perturbation theory, i.e. write ˜cµ → c0µ + ˜cµ
where c0µ represents some minima of the action. This expansion may well have quadratic terms as
the most dominant contribution, allowing perturbation theory. However developing a perturbative
treatment of this action is going to be challenging. From the perspective of renormalisation, it is
interesting that the dynamical variables are dimensionless: the propagator has the dimensions of
1/k4 which might mean that there are at most only logarithmic divergences (or it might not).

There is a clear minimum of the action when all the ﬁelds are constant, i.e. ∂µ˜cµ = 0,
∂µ ˜dµ = 0 and ∂µ ˜yµ = 0, or some gauge transformation of these ﬁelds. This is, however, not the
only minimum. For example, if the volume is a torus with periodic boundary conditions and side
lengths Lµ, we can have a similar solution with some winding in at least one of the directions ˜cµ, i.e.
∂µ˜cµ = 2πνµ
, ∂µ ˜dµ = 0, ∂µ ˜yµ = 0, where νµ is a constant in space integer winding number (again,
Lµ
not a Lorentz four vector). Thus some solutions with non-zero winding will contribute to the path
integral. Aside from this winding, ﬁelds except where ∂µ˜cµ ∼ O(g) and ∂µ ˜dµ = O(g) (or higher
order) will often be heavily suppressed by factors of O(1/g) or O(1/g2) and will not contribute in
the g → 0 continuum limit. This will ensure that the gauge ﬁelds are reasonably smooth in space.
The gauge invariance of this operator is hidden by the notation (but is still present, of course,
since we have done nothing except re-express the theory in terms of new variables); it would still
be necessary to gauge ﬁx as usual before computing observables.

However, on a torus with periodic boundary conditions (or some other parametrisation of the
coordinates which involves closed loops, although in these cases the form of the ﬁeld strength
tensor would be diﬀerent at the corners of the loops), it is possible for both ˜cµ and ˜dµ to have
non-trivial topology. We perform a change of variables, writing

where ˜c0
µ = 0), νcµ and νdµ are integer winding numbers, and ˜cµ and
dµ are the new dynamical ﬁelds, which are now restricted to the range −π/g to π/g. ˜dµ → ˜dµ + π
is related to the centre symmetry θµ → −θµ, which does not aﬀect the physics; thus for ˜dµ the
winding numbers need only be multiplied by π rather than 2π. We have added the possibility
of additional winding in the directions orthogonal to µ, which is possible if we use Cartesian
coordinates. This means that each ∂µ˜cµ term in the action will produce something proportional
to the winding number. When we replace the derivatives with the winding numbers, these can lead
to mass-like terms in the action for the y and c ﬁelds. The relevant part of the action (excluding

where the . . . contain the various kinetic and interaction terms in the Lagrangian. We need to
take the L → ∞ limit and g → 0 limit to recover continuum (Euclidean) QCD. It is convinent
to take these limits simultaneously with L√g kept constant, which keeps the various mass terms
ﬁnite as we take these two limits. We can expect that the average size of the winding numbers
νc and νd will be proportional to the length L; this constant of proportionality will provide the
dynamical scale for the mass terms in the action.

Thus what we have proposed is a possible mechanism for the dynamical generation of gluon
masses via the topological winding of the ˜c and ˜d parameters in the gauge ﬁelds. This remains far
short of a proof: the bound states of the theory have to be gauge covariant, and so will be some
function of ˜yµ, ˜cµ and ˜dµ which preserves the measure and is gauge covariant. What we still need
to do is ﬁnd these bound states, re-express the path integral and action in terms of these variables,
shift the variables to remove the linear terms in the action, and show that the winding of ˜cµ and
˜dµ dynamically generates a mass term in that action. This is obviously a lot of eﬀort, and we will
not attempt it here. We showed in [6] that the winding number itself is invariant under smooth
gauge transformations.

5. Topological Dominance of Wilson Loop and Polyakov Line

As shown before, though a judicious choice of coordinate basis and Abelian Decomposition,
we can express the Wilson Loop (or Polyakov Loop) in terms of an Abelian ﬁeld rotated into a

17

basis determined by the Abelian Decomposition,

WL = θe−i H dxµ

1

2 λj tr(θλj θ†gAµ(x)+iλj θ†∂µθ)θ†,

(69)

where the λ matrices are normalised so that trλ2
j = 2. From equation (26) we see that the θ†∂µθ
term contains contributions proportional to λ3 sin2 a∂µc (in SU(3) there is a similar expression [6]),
where a and c are the two parameters which parametrise the SU(2) θ matrix. In [6] we hypothesised
that winding in c could lead to an area law Wilson Loop. The question remains, of course, whether
the Maxwell term proportional to Aµ could also contribute to this loop.

As shown above, neither the Maxwell term nor the θ term are gauge invariant. Thus to naively
ask whether the θ term dominates is impossible: it depends on the gauge. Equally, to specify a,
c and measure the winding it is necessary to ﬁrst specify the gauge. It is obviously possible to ﬁx
to a gauge such that the Maxwell term dominates: we just choose a gauge where θ is the identity
operator. What is less clear is whether it is possible to ﬁx the gauge so that the θ term dominates
the Wilson or Polyakov Loop. What we want is to choose the gauge transformation Λ so that

I dxµtr(nj(gAµ + i∂µ(Λ†)Λ)) = 0.

(70)

In principle, this should not be a problem: we have one condition, and three times as many
variables as we have lattice sites contributing to the loop, so the system is considerably over-
determined. However, there is also a second condition: the θ ﬁeld needs to be a smooth function
of position for the previous derivations to be valid. Ideally, therefore, we wish to switch to a gauge
where the topological part dominates the Wilson loop, and the θ ﬁeld is as smooth as possible
given this condition. On the lattice, we did not quite do this, but instead choose a gauge condition
such that ∆ is minimised, where

∆ = ∆1 + ∆2

∆1 = [tr(WL − e−i H dxµ

1

2 λj tr(λj θ†∂µθ))]2

∆2 = ζXµ,x

tr(1 − θxθ†x+ǫˆµ),

(71)

and ζ is some tunable small parameter. In practice, this is considerably easier to compute than
the condition needed for perfect topological dominance, which is to have ∆2 (smoothness of θ)
minimised given ∆1 = 0 (θ dominance of the Wilson Loop). We found that it was quite easy to
have very low values for both ∆1 and ∆2, suggesting that this gauge condition is reasonable. In
our numerical simulations we could also ﬁnd solutions where ∆1 = 0 quite easily, suggesting that
satisfying condition (70) is indeed overdetermined, although occasionally we had to try several
starting guesses to our routine minimising of ∆ before we found this solution.

Fixing to this gauge allows us to study how topology contained within the θ ﬁeld drives
conﬁnement, but only in this gauge. What about the other gauges? We have chosen a gauge where

the Maxwell contribution to the Wilson Loop is zero, H dxµtr(nj(gAµ)) = 0. When we switch to
another gauge, we add to this the term from the gauge ﬁxing matrix, −iH dxµtr(nj ∂µ(Λ†)Λ),

which in general will not be zero. However, this is of the same form as the θ term. In other words,
we can parametrise Λ in the same way that we do θ, and the same topological objects will be
present in the restricted ﬁeld, only moved to the Maxwell term.

When we perform a gauge transformation in SU(2), we convert the Maxwell term to

trθλ3θ†Aµ → trΛθλ3θ†Λ†(ΛAµΛ† + iΛ∂µΛ†).

(72)

We can write the gauge transformation matrix Λ in the form Leil3λ3 θ†, where L is the SU (N )/U (1)
that θ transforms to in the new gauge (parametrised by NC (NC − 1) variables). In this case, the
gauge ﬁeld transforms to

Aµ → Leil3λ3θ†(Aµ + i∂µθθ† + θ∂µl3λ3θ† + θe−il3λ3 i∂µL†Leil3λ3 θ†)θe−il3λ3 L†

(73)

18

So the gauge transformation involves adding the original θ term of the action to the gauge ﬁeld,
rotating the gauge ﬁeld, and then subtracting the new θ term from the gauge ﬁeld. This means
that all we are doing by ﬁnding θ, performing the Abelian decomposition, and using this choice
of gauge ﬁxing is extracting that part of the gauge ﬁeld that is responsible for conﬁnement and
isolating it from the rest of the gauge ﬁeld. Every topological object we ﬁnd in θ in this gauge
is present in the Maxwell term in any other gauge which lacks that object. The gauge ﬁxing just
helps us to identify and see these topological objects without the complications of the various
background noise and any topology not involved in the conﬁnement of these particular quarks.

We should also comment on that the choice of θ depends on which Wilson Loop we study, and
in general the topological objects will be diﬀerent from one Wilson Loop to another. This means
that we cannot (by our methods) identify what is conﬁning the quarks without specifying which
quarks are to be conﬁned. We are looking at the string that forms between a speciﬁc quark-anti-
quark pair. This is not a real burden to our method, because any observed instance of quark
conﬁnement would conﬁne two particular quarks.3

6. Numerical results

Our numerical results are taken from an SU(2) pure Yang-Mills lattice ensemble, generated
at β = 3.4 with a L¨uscher-Weisz gauge action. The lattice volume is 163 × 32, and we used 15
steps of stout smearing [22, 23] at parameters ρ = 0.1, ǫ = 0 to smooth the ﬁeld before computing
any observables. Our ensemble contained 150 conﬁgurations. All errors were computed using the
bootstrap method.

We proceed by using the prescription described earlier. On each conﬁguration we select a
series of nested and stacked X × T rectangular loops in the xt plane starting and ending at a ﬁxed
point, and perform the Abelian decomposition so that the Wilson Loops on these curves computed
from the Yang-Mills and original gauge ﬁelds are identical, and then gauge ﬁx by minimising the
quantity

∆ =Xx,µ

ζtr(1 − Θµ) + (trWL[U ] − trWL[Θ])2,

(74)

2 λ3trλ3θ†

where WL[Θ] is the topological part of the restricted Wilson Loop measured using the gauge link,
and Θµ = ei 1
x,µθx+ ˆµ,µ . The ﬁrst term in ∆ is minimised when the gauge ﬁeld is smooth,
and the second term is minimised then the topological part of the Wilson Loop is identical to
the Wilson Loop from the original Yang Mills ﬁeld. Our gauge ﬁxing procedure proceeds in steps
gradually reducing the parameter ζ to a value of 10−5 divided by the lattice volume. A large value
of ζ means that the minimisation routine concentrates on ﬁnding a smooth ﬁeld; a small value
means that it tries to match the Wilson Loops. We found that starting oﬀ with a large value and
then gradually reducing it was the best way to eﬃciently satisfy both conditions.

We used a molecular dynamics procedure for our minimisation algorithm, introducing a ﬁcti-
tious momentum, writing ∆ as a potential energy, and evolving along the classical equations of
motion (using a numerical integration) while resetting the momentum to zero every so often when
the rate of descent of the potential energy stopped increasing with each micro-canonical step.
The molecular dynamics routine conserves the kinetic energy plus ∆; by starting with kinetic
energy zero we ensure the kinetic energy increases during the early parts of the trajectory, and
consequently ∆ must decrease. The initial micro-canonical step is identical to the steepest descent
method, but the descent of ∆ then accelerates as the trajectory continues. One can also add

3Of course, we are here only considering the unphysical case of static or inﬁnitely heavy quarks; so perhaps this
appeal to physical observables might seem unpalatable. The solution would, of course, be to generalise the Wilson
Loop so that it can also study light quarks, perhaps by oﬀering a weighted average over possible paths the quarks
can travel.

19

in some friction, i.e. a damping force proportional to the momentum, which in exact arithmetic
would guarantee convergence to a local minimum of ∆ within a single trajectory; in practice,
however, just restarting the trajectory with zero momentum every so often proved to be more
eﬃcient.

To compute ∆ we use periodic boundary conditions in all directions. This introduces some
ﬁnite size eﬀects on the larger loops, because we force the two sides of the larger Wilson Loops
to be similar to each other. So, for instance, if we have a Wilson Loop with X = 15 (the largest
value allowed on our lattice), the smoothness condition implies that the value of θ on one side of
the loop at x = 15 should be close to the value at x = 14 (with the same y, z and t coordinates),
which will be close to the θ at x = 13, and so on across the lattice to x = 0 on the other side of
the original Wilson Loop. For a large Wilson Loop, these ﬁfteen close tos can add up to quite a
substantial discrepancy, and in an inﬁnite volume this series of intermediate steps is the only way
the smoothness condition can aﬀect the two opposite sides of the Wilson Loop. However, if we
impose periodic boundary conditions in the x direction then we will also have a condition forcing
the x = 0 θ ﬁeld to be close to the θ ﬁeld at x = 15 on the opposite side of the Wilson Loop. This
is just a ﬁnite volume eﬀect, but given that we are using a relatively small lattice, it might be
signiﬁcant. It is, however, necessary that we keep a smooth θ ﬁeld to keep a connection between
the lattice and continuum theories, so we cannot switch to open boundary conditions. Instead,
we exclude the largest Wilson Loops from our observables.

We have not encountered a serious Gribov problem (numerous local minima of the gauge ﬁxing
condition) on our smaller test lattices, but have not examined this issue on the production lattices
because of lack of computer resources. We do not expect that our results will be aﬀected by Gribov
copies, but this needs investigation.

The ﬁrst thing to do is to conﬁrm that out Abelian Decomposition/gauge ﬁxing procedure
does indeed extract the conﬁning part of the gauge ﬁeld into ﬁrst of all the restricted ﬁeld and
secondly the topological part of the restricted ﬁeld. This is shown in ﬁgure 2. We provide two
plots. The ﬁrst one shows how expectation value of the trace of the Wilson Loop constructed
using the original gauge ﬁeld, the restricted gauge ﬁeld, and the topological part of the restricted
ﬁeld scales with the area of the Wilson Loop. For large enough loop areas, we expect log trhWLi
to scale linearly with the area of the loop, and we see this. This, of course, is nothing new. Our
main result is that our three data sources are indistinguishable from each other. This shows two
things: ﬁrstly, that it is indeed possible to gauge ﬁx so that the topological term fully accounts
for the string tension. Secondly, it shows that our gauge ﬁxing ansatz works and actually does
what it was meant to. The second plot in ﬁgure 2 shows an extrapolation of the string tension to
inﬁnite time. We ﬁtted the Wilson Loop data to the formula hWLi = e−V (x,t)t, with V (x, t)t =
ρxt + α1x + α2t + α3 + α4x/t + α5t/x + α6/x + α7/t + α8/(xt), which had a χ2 per degree of
freedom of 1.3. The second ﬁgure in the plot shows the variation of V (x,∞) ≡ V (x) with x.
Once again, the shape of this curve is standard: we see a little curvature due to the Coloumb
interaction at small distances (this curvature is reduced by our smearing), and then the potential
increases linearly with x. However, once again the key point is that the Yang-Mills, restricted and
topological part string tensions are all indistinguishable from each other. This conﬁrms that we
have completely isolated the cause of quark conﬁnement into the topological part of the restricted
ﬁeld.

Having gauge ﬁxed, we can now investigate the variation of the parameters a and c as we
move round the Wilson Loops. For ﬁgures 3-8, we have taken one yz slice of the lattice, and
used this to create plots of a and c. We looked numerous diﬀerent slices of the lattice on diﬀerent
conﬁgurations, and saw similar features each time; the slice we show is a typical example (our only
criteria in selecting the slice was to have an average amount of winding and avoid the extremes
of both having too little – where there would be no features of interest – and too much winding
– where there would be too much going on and the picture would be confused – on the slice we
displayed. We show the ﬁrst slice we looked at which satisﬁed this criteria). We have singled out
a particular set of nested Wilson Loops to make the plots clearer. In ﬁgures 3 and 4, we have
presented a plot of a and c respectively plotted against the x and y coordinates of the lattice for
four diﬀerent Wilson Loops, which are represented by four diﬀerent symbols on the plots. These

Figure 2: The expected value of the Wilson Loop (left) and static quark potential (after an extrapolation to inﬁnite
time) (right), where the Wilson Loop is calculated with the Yang-Mills gauge ﬁeld (U ), the restricted gauge ﬁeld
(U hat) and the topological part of the restricted gauge ﬁeld (top).

are the Wilson loops starting at positions (x, t) = (4, 4) (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), or with lengths in each
direction (7, 12) (i.e. the Wilson Loop extends seven lattice sites in the x direction and twelve
in the t direction), (5, 10), (3, 8) and (1, 6) respectively. To make these plots clearer, we have
unwound each Wilson Loop and plotted them on a two dimensional ﬁgure, in ﬁgures 5-8. Here
the x axis marks the position along the Wilson Loop. We start in the corner with smallest x and
t, then proceed along the loop in the direction of increasing x, then the direction of increasing t,
then decreasing x and decreasing t until we return to the starting point. The very left and very
right of these plots thus indicate the same position on the Wilson Loop.

We can see several things from these plots. Firstly, we notice that the parameter c can have a
non-zero winding number as it moves along the Wilson Loop, as in ﬁgure 7 where we can see it
wrapping itself around the unit circle between positions 18 and 23 (and once more on the loop).
As already argued, the emergence of winding is a requirement for our explanation of how the area
law of the Wilson Loop emerges. Secondly, we can see that the variation in both a and c is smooth
most of the time as we move along the Wilson Loop. This is not surprising, since we gauge ﬁxed
θ so that it was a reasonably smooth function of position. For the ﬁrst plot, ﬁgure 5, with a 1 × 6
Wilson Loop, we see that the evolution of c is reasonably smooth (bearing in mind that c = 0
is equivalent to c = 2π). The second plot, ﬁgure 6, with a 3 × 8 Wilson Loop, has minima in a
at positions 15 and 21, and there is some discontinuity in c there. In ﬁgure 7, the next of the
nested Wilson Loops moving outwards, these small bumps each turn into a full winding of the c
parameter around the unit circle. In the next Wilson Loop, in ﬁgure 8, the winding is maintained.
The small value of a at position 27 on ﬁgure 8 leads to additional winding in subsequent Wilson
Loops (not shown in these plots). Thirdly we notice that the values of a tend to be relatively
small; in principle a can vary between 0 and π/2, however we do not see any a larger than about
π/4. We notice that there are some points where the evolution of c is not smooth, and that it
jumps by a large amount. One example of this is at position 21 on ﬁgure 6. We also observe that
these jumps occur only at very small values of a, which again we expect since here there can be
large changes in c while θ evolves smoothly.

In conclusion, we see winding emerging when a has a minima close to zero. These represent
the topological objects identiﬁed in our previous paper as candidate causes of conﬁnement. The
winding plays a key role in our candidate model for conﬁnement, and that it is present is a
necessary requirement for our model to be correct.

If the topological part dominates the string tension, there are three possibilities which could

cause this. Recall that in SU(2) the topological part can be reduced to H sin2 a∂σcdσ where σ

represents the distance along the Wilson Loop. This leaves six possibilities for the area law of the
Wilson Loop.

1. The average value of sin2 a increases with the area of the Wilson Loop.

Area of Wilson Loop

Perimiter of Wilson Loop

Figure 9: The average value of sin2 a for those θ ﬁelds along a Wilson Loop plotted against the area of the Wilson
Loop (left) and the perimeter of the Wilson Loop (right).

2. There is an increasing correlation between sin2 a and ∂σc, so that on larger loops sin2 a is
large where there is a large value of ∂σc, while on smaller loops there is no such correlation.

3. H ∂σcdσ increases with the area of the Wilson Loop, which means that the winding number

scales with the area of the Wilson Loop.

The remaining three options are various combinations of these; for example if both sin2 a and the
winding number increase with the square root of the area of the Wilson Loop.

Let us start by looking at how the average value of sin2 a varies with the size of the Wilson Loop.
This is plotted in ﬁgure 9. There are two plots here: the ﬁrst shows the conﬁguration average of
sin2 a compared to the area of the Wilson Loop, and the second shows the conﬁguration average
of sin2 a compared to the perimeter of the Wilson Loop. We have excluded those Wilson Loops
with either a very small extent in one direction (which should have some Coulomb part to the
interaction), or an extent close to the lattice volume (where there might be ﬁnite volume eﬀects).
We do not see any signiﬁcant change in this quantity as the size of the Wilson Loop changes. This
means that, since sin2 a does not increase with the Wilson Loop size, this cannot even partially
be responsible for the area law and quark conﬁnement. One thing that surprises us about these
results is that the average value of sin2 a is well short of the the value of 1
2 that is implied from the
expected distribution of θ before gauge ﬁxing was applied (for example as seen in the computed
measure). Gauge ﬁxing has seriously distorted the distribution of θ. This is worrying because it
makes our results harder to reconcile with the study of Greensite and H¨ollwieser in [24], where it
was found that circulating the Wilson Loop twice destroyed the signal for conﬁnement. We expect
the average value of the Wilson Loop to be (to a rough approximation) 2πνhsin2 ai for each time
we move around it, and if hsin2 ai ∼ 1
2 then for a single circuit around the Wilson Loop, this
will be some integer multiple of π, which can have a physical eﬀect, while for a double circuit we
would obtain (approximately) some integer multiple of 2π, which is indistinguishable for 0. This
would explain why going round the Wilson Loop twice would destroy any signal for conﬁnement.
However, we ﬁnd that hsin2 ai ∼ 0.05, which is considerably smaller than 1
2 . The issue of why the
signal for conﬁnement disappears when we circle the Wilson Loop twice is thus still uncertain.
Possibly there is a ﬁnite size eﬀect or lattice artefact at play. This will, however, need to be a
topic for future research.

We next check the correlation between sin2 a and ∂µc. We do this using two diﬀerent measures,

χ1 =

χ2 =

hsin2 a∂µci − hsin2 aih∂µci

q(hsin4 ai − hsin2 ai2)(h(∂µc)2i − h∂µci2)
q(hsin4 ai − hsin2 ai2)(h|∂µc|2i − h|∂µc|i2)

hsin2 a|∂µc|i − hsin2 aih|∂µc|i

If sin2 a (with a measured on the lattice as the average value between neighbouring lattice sites)
and ∂µc (measured on the lattice via the diﬀerence operator) are correlated with each other, then
these quantities should give 1. If there is no correlation, they should be smaller or even negative
(for example if a is small where ∂µc is large and vice versa). We plot these correlation functions
against the Wilson Loop area and perimeter in ﬁgures 10 and 11. Once again, we see that there is
little dependence on the size of the Wilson Loop. The data is scattered with no obvious pattern
at all. We do not see any strong evidence that this eﬀect is driving conﬁnement.

So that just leaves the possibility that the winding number scales like the area of the Wilson
Loop. We have already noted that the introduction of winding is related to small values of a, so
the ﬁrst thing to check is how many minima of a are contained within a Wilson Loop of given
area and volume. This is plotted in ﬁgure 12, where we see, as expected, the number of minima
is proportional to the area of the Wilson Loop.

We plot the dependence of the winding number in ﬁgure 13 where we show the average value of
the modulus of the winding number ν (since ultimately ±|ν| contribute equally to the ﬁnal string
tension) against the area of the loop and the loop’s perimeter. Here we do see a clear increase in
the winding number as the area of the loop increases. The data is, unfortunately, very scattered,
suggesting that there might be a dependence on other factors as well as the loop area. The scatter
makes it diﬃcult to conﬁrm a linear increase of the winding number with the area of the loop.
This suggests that the statement that ‘the winding number alone drives the area law behaviour
of the Wilson Loop’ is a little too simplistic, since there is more to the question than just this.
However, the increase of the winding number with the loop area and the lack of any increase in
sin2 a and the correlation between a and c suggest that an increase in winding is the dominant

7. Conclusions

In our previous work, we showed that the Cho-Duan-Ge Abelian decomposition was a useful
tool to study quark conﬁnement by demonstrating that the restricted ﬁeld could fully account
for the string tension, and by identifying the topological objects which could lead to an area law
Wilson Loop and thus a conﬁning potential. However, the restricted ﬁeld is divided into two parts,
the Maxwell part and the topological part, and in our previous work we did not show that the
topological part dominated conﬁnement.

Our main result of this work is to show that by ﬁxing to one of a particular set of gauges,
the topological part of the action dominates the string tension. The topological objects we are
concentrating on are present in the full Yang-Mills ﬁeld in any gauge, but by performing the
dual steps of the Abelian decomposition and the gauge ﬁxing we are able to isolate them and
separate them from many of the non-conﬁning contributions to the gauge ﬁeld. We can conﬁrm
via numerical simulations that in SU(2) gauge theory our proposed topological objects, which
are generated when the parameter a is small, and lead to a non-zero winding number for the
second parameter we have labelled c are indeed present. This strongly suggests that our proposed
mechanism is at least partly responsible for conﬁnement, at least in SU(2) gauge theory. The
topological part alone reproduces the whole string tension, and the topological string tension is
driven only by the increase of the winding number while the area of the loop increases, while the
number of topological objects scales well with the area of the Wilson Loop. None of the other

29

eﬀects which could contribute to an area-law Wilson Loop seem to have any noticeable scaling
with the area.

We have also began the process of developing this idea into a fully dynamical theory. We have
shown that it is possible to deﬁne the measure and express the action in terms of the parameters of
our Abelian decomposition, with the dynamical parameters being cos 2aµ, ˜cµ and ˜dµ, with ˜aµ and
˜cµ describing the θ ﬁeld and ˜dµ the decomposed restricted ﬁeld. The Yang Mills action expressed
in terms of these variables is complicated even in SU(2), and we have not yet developed the
Feynman rules let alone investigated the renormalisability of this parametrisation of Yang-Mills
theory. While the standard parametrisation of Yang-Mills theory is more useful since it makes
Gauge and Lorentz symmetry more manifest, this new parametrisation might be helpful in trying
to investigate the topological basis of conﬁnement analytically as well as numerically.

This work obvious still has numerous limitations, which need to be addressed in future research.
Firstly, we have only studied the SU(2) theory instead of the physical SU(3). SU(2) has the
advantage that it is considerably simpler and clearer, and we expect the same process to be
involved in SU(3), since the SU(3) θ is built from three separate SU(2) subcomponents, each
of which can contribute to the overall winding number in the same way as in SU(2), although
the measure in SU(3) is only similar to the SU(2) measure for two of these sub-matrices. For
the moment, SU(3) studies are too expensive for our available computer resources; however, this
study needs to be reproduced in SU(3). Secondly, we have only considered one value of the
lattice spacing and lattice volume. We do not expect any great diﬀerence as we change the lattice
spacing or lattice volume (since we are only interested in qualitative eﬀects rather than extracting
some phenomenological result where a continuum extrapolation would be essential), but this is
nonetheless something which could be improved. We also need to investigate the deconﬁnement
transition, and the link with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. It would also be good to
conﬁrm our numerical results analytically, i.e. show that the topological objects do in fact arise
in practice, and represent minima of the action. Having re-parametrised the Yang-Mills theory
in terms of the variables which describe the topological objects, we believe that such an analytic
approach will be possible, but it remains very challenging.

Multiplying each of these terms by the coeﬃcients implied by equation (80) and summing them up
gives the Jacobian to ﬁrst order in li (at ˜ai = 0 or ˜ai = π/2 this calculation breaks down since the
expansion is in in l ≪ cos ˜a and l ≪ sin ˜a; however these points will be forbidden by the measure
so we can neglect them):
