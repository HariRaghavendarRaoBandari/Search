Divisibility of points in commutative algebraic groups

Laura Paladino∗

Abstract

Let k be a number ﬁeld and let G be a commutative algebraic group deﬁned over
k. Let p be a prime number and let G[p] denote the p-torsion subgroup of G. It is
well-known that G[p] ∼= (Z/pZ)n, for some positive integer n depending only on G.
We prove that for every n, there exists a prime pn depending only on n, such that
if G does not admit a k-rational isogeny of degree ph, for all 1 ≤ h ≤ n − 1, then
the local-global divisibility by p holds in G(k), for all primes p > pn. In particular
this is true for all abelian varieties and generalizes some previous result showed for
elliptic curves.

Introduction

Let k be a number ﬁeld and let G be a commutative algebraic group deﬁned over k. For

every positive integer q, let G[q] be the q-torsion subgroup of G. As usual, we denote by

Gm and Ga respectively the multiplicative group and the additive group deﬁned over k.

By Chevalley’s theorem on the classiﬁcation of algebraic groups on characteristic zero

(see [23, Prop. 11, 12 of Chap. III, §2.7 and Cor. of Chap. VII, §2.7]) we have an exact

sequence

0 → (Gr

m × Gs

a) → G → A → 0,

where r and s are positive integers and A is an abelian variety deﬁned over k (see also

[6]). As a consequence of this fact, the q-torsion subgroup G[q] has a normal subgroup

m × Gs

isomorphic to (Gr
a)[q], with a quotient isomorphic to A[q]. Furthermore, the group
G[q] has exponent q and then G[q] ∼= Z/qZn, with n = r + 2g, where g is the dimension
of the abelian variety A. We denote by k(G[q]) the number ﬁeld obtained by adding to

k the coordinates of the q-torsion points of G. Then the Galois group Gal(k(G[q])/k)
is isomorphic to the image of the representation of the absolute Galois group Gal(¯k/k)

in the general linear group GLn(q). The behaviour of Gal(k(G[q])/k) is related to the

answer of the following classical question, known as Local-Global Divisibility Problem (see

[6]).

PROBLEM: Let P ∈ A(k) and let q be a positive integer. Assume that for all but ﬁnitely

many valuations v ∈ k, there exists Dv ∈ A(kv) such that P = qDv. Is it possible to

conclude that there exists D ∈ A(k) such that P = qD?

This problem arises as a generalization of the Hasse principle, where we consider powers

of primes instead of squares and commutative algebraic groups deﬁned over number ﬁelds

instead of the multiplicative group deﬁned over Q. The vanishing of the ﬁrst cohomology
group H 1(Gal(k(G[q])/k), G[q]) assures a positive answer (see for instance [6], [26]). By

B´ezout’s identity, to get answers for general integers it suﬃces to solve the problem for

powers pl, where p is a prime number and l is a positive integer. When A = Gm, Artin

and Tate proved that the local-global divisibility holds for powers of odd prime numbers

and for powers of 2 dividing 4 (see [2]). On the contrary, the answer is negative for powers

2l, with l ≥ 3 (see for instance [25]). In the case of elliptic curves the problem has been

widely studied and recently a complete answer has been proved when k = Q. The answer

is positive when q is a prime p (see [6], [26]). The answer is also positive for powers pl of

prime numbers p ≥ 5, with l ≥ 2 (see [20]). On the contrary, the answer is negative for

q = pl, with p ∈ {2, 3} and l ≥ 2 (see [5], [7] ,[17], [18]). For a general number ﬁeld k,

the answer is still positive when q is a prime p (see [6], [26]). Furthermore, Dvornicich

and Zannier essentially proved that the local-global principle for divisibility by pl holds

in elliptic curves deﬁned over a number ﬁeld that do not admit a k-rational isogeny of

degree p (see [8]). A precise statement is the following (see also [19]).

Theorem 1.1. Let p be a prime. Let E be an elliptic curve deﬁned over a number ﬁeld k
which does not contain the ﬁeld Q(ζp + ζ −1

p ), where ζp is a primitive pth root of the unity.
If E does not admit any k-rational isogeny of degree p, then the local-global principle holds

for divisibility by pl in E over k, for every positive integer l.

The hypothesis that k does not contain Q(ζp + ζ −1

p ) is necessary (see [19] and [20, Sec.
6]). Stronger criteria for the local-global divisibility in elliptic curves have been given in

[19] and [20] too. In particular if E does not admit any k-rational torsion point of exact

order p, then the local-global principle holds for divisibility by pl. As a consequence of

the celebrated results of Merel (see [12]) and Parent (see [21]), thus there exists a prime

pk, depending only on k, such that if p > pk, then the answer is positive for divisibility
by pl in E/k (see [19]). There exists an answer for the divisibility by p in the case of

algebraic tori too (see [9]). In a torus of dimension r, the answer is positive if r < 3(p−1).

For other algebraic groups the answer was unknown, even for q = p.

In [6], Dvornicich and Zannier underline that the answer in this last case is not obvious.
In fact they show an example in which H 1

loc(Γ, Z/pZ) 6= 0, where Γ is a subgroup of the

p-Sylow subgroup of GL3(p) of the form




1 a
0
0

b
1 λa
0
1


 , a, b ∈ Z/pZ, λ ∈ Z/pZ∗.

They also show an example in which H 1

loc(Γ, Z/pZ) 6= 0, where Γ is a subgroup of the

p-Sylow subgroup of GL4(p). Here we prove the following statement.

Theorem 1.2. Let p be a prime number and let n be a positive integer. Let k be a number
ﬁeld that does not contain Q(ζp + ζ −1
p ). Let G be a commutative algebraic group deﬁned
over k, such that G[p] ∼= Z/pZn. For every n, there exists a prime pn, depending only on
n, such that if G does not admit a k-rational isogeny of degree ph, with 1 ≤ h ≤ n − 1,

then the local-global divisibility by p holds in G(k), for all p > pn. In particular p1 = 2,

p2 = p3 = p4 = 3, p5 = p6 = 5, p7 = p8 = p9 = p10 = 7, p11 = p12 = 11.

More precisely, we prove that if “Gal(K/K) acts either irreducibly or decomposably over

G[p], then the local-global divisibility by p holds in G(k), for all p > pn” (see Theorem

4.1 in Subsection 4.3).

In the proof we use some well-known results in the theory of groups and some results

in local-global divisibility. We state a few of those preliminary results in next section.

Then we treat the special case in which Gal(k(G[pl])/k) acts decomposably over k(G[pl])

and, in particular, we give an answer to the problem for products of elliptic curves. In

the last part of the paper, we proceed with the proof of Theorem 1.2.

2 Preliminary results

In this section we state some known results about local-global divisibility and about

group theory, that will be useful for the proof of Theorem 1.2.

Let q := pl, where p is a prime number and let l is a positive integer. As above, we

denote by G[pl], the pl-torsion subgroup of G and by k(G[pl]) the number ﬁeld obtained

Preliminary results

4

by adding to k the coordinates of the pl-torsion points of G. To ease notation, we set

G := Gal(k(G[pl])/k).

In [6] Dvornicich and Zannier proved that the answer to the problem is linked to the

behaviour of a subgroup of H 1(G, G[pl]).

Deﬁnition 2.1. Let G be a group and let M be a G-module. A cocycle {Zσ}σ∈G ∈
H 1(G, M ) satisﬁes the local condition if for every σ ∈ G there exists Aσ ∈ M such that
Zσ = (σ − 1)Aσ. The subgroup of H 1(G, M ) formed by the cocycles satisfying the local

conditions is called ﬁrst local cohomological group of G with values in M and it is denoted
by H 1

loc(G, M ).

Theorem 2.2 (Dvornicich, Zannier, 2001). Let G be a commutative algebraic group
deﬁned over a number ﬁeld k. If H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0, then the local-global divisibility by pl

holds in G over k.

Another important result proved in [6] is about the p-Sylow subgroup of G.

Lemma 2.3 (Dvornicich, Zannier, 2001). Let G be the p-Sylow subgroup of G. An
element of H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) is zero if and only if its restriction to H 1

loc(Gp, G[pl]) is zero.

We recall Sah’s Theorem, that will be useful in the following.

Lemma 2.4 (Sah’s Theorem, [11] Theorem 5.1). Let G be a group and let M be a G-
module. Let α be in the center of G. Then H 1(G, M ) is annihilated by the map x → αx−x
on M . In particular, if this map is an automorphism of M , then H 1(G, M ) = 0.

As a consequence of Lemma 2.4, in particular we have the next statement.

Corollary 2.5. Let G ≤ GLn(Z/qZ), for some positive integers n and q. If λ · In ∈ G
is a nontrivial scalar matrix, then H 1

loc(G, (Z/qZ)n) = 0.

Proof. By Sah’s Theorem, we have H 1(G, (Z/qZ)n) = 0. The conclusion follows from
H 1

loc(G, (Z/qZ)n) ≤ H 1(G, (Z/qZ)n).

In our proof of Theorem 1.2, we also use Aschbacher’s Theorem on the classiﬁcation

of maximal subgroup of GLn(q) (see [1]). Aschbacher proved that the maximal subgroups

of GLn(q) could be divided in 9 classes Ci, with 1 ≤ i ≤ 9. For a big n it is a very hard

open problem to ﬁnd explicitly the maximal subgroups of GLn(q) of type C9. On the

contrary, the subgroups of GLn(q) of geometric type (i. e. of class Ci, with 1 ≤ i ≤ 8)

Preliminary results

have been described for every n (see [10]). We recall some standard notations in group

theory and then we resume the classiﬁcation of the maximal subgroups of geometric type

in the following Table 1.

Notation 1. Let n, q be positive integers and let Fq be the ﬁnite ﬁeld with q elements.

We denote by

• SLn(q) the special linear group of n × n matrices with entries in Fq;

• PGLn(q) the projective linear group of n × n matrices with entries in Fq;

• SOn(q) the special orthogonal group of n × n matrices with entries in Fq;

• Un(q) the group of unitary n × n matrices with entries in Fq;

• Sn the symmetric group on n elements;

• An the alternating group on n elements;

• Cn the cyclic group of order n;

• A.B a group G that is an extension of its normal subgroup A with a group B (B

is then a quotient of G by A), in the case when we do not know if it is a split

extension or not;

• A.B a group G that is a non-split extension of its normal subgroup A with a group

B (B is then a quotient of G by A);

• A ⋊ B the semidirect product of A and B (where A is the normal subgroup);

• A ◦ B the central product of A and B;

• A ≀ B the wreath product of A and B;

• p1+2n, an extraspecial group of order p1+2n.

Notation 2. Let ωq be a primitive element of F∗

q. As in [3], if n is even and q is odd,

we denote by

• GO+

n (q) the stabilizer of the non-degenerate symmetric bilinear antidiagonal form

(1,...,1);

• SO+

n (q) the subgroup of GO+

n (q) formed by the matrices with determinant 1;

• GO+

n (q) the stabilizer of non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form In, when n ≡
2(mod 4) and q ≡ 3(mod 4) and the stabilizer of non-degenerate symmetric bilinear

• SO−

n (q) the subgroup of GO−

n (q) formed by the matrices with determinant 1.

Although we generally do not know explicitly the maximal subgroups of type C9, by

Aschbacher’s Theorem, we have such a description of them:

“if G is a maximal subgroup of GLn(q) of class C9, then for some nonabelian simple

group T , the group G/(G ∩ Z) is almost simple with socle T ; in this case the normal

subgroup (GZ).T acts absolutely irreducibly, preserves no nondegenerate classical form,

is not a subﬁeld group, and does not contain SLn(q).”

Furthermore, for very small integers n there are a few subsequent and more explicit

versions of Aschbacher’s Theorem, that describe explicitly even the subgroups of class

C9. To prove Theorem 1.2 we will use the classiﬁcation of the maximal subgroups of

SLn(q) appearing in [3], for n ≤ 12. Then, from the exact sequence

(2.1)

we will then get information on the maximal subgroups of GLn(q).

3 Decomposable actions and products of elliptic curves

We ﬁrst investigate what happens when the group Gal(k(G[q])/k, G[q]) acts decomposably

on G[q], for any positive integer q. In this case, the representation of G in GLn(q) is a

group of matrices with diagonal blocks.

Lemma 3.1. Let q be a positive integer and let GLn(Z/qZ) denote the group of n × n

invertible matrices, with entries in Z/qZ. Suppose that G acts decomposably on G[q], i.

e. the representation of G in GLn(Z/qZ) is of the form



(3.1)

i=1 ni = n. If H 1

loc(Ai, Z/qZni ) = 0, for all

Proof. We prove the statement when h = 2. When h > 2, the conclusion follows by

induction. Assume that the representation of G = Gal(k(G[q])/k, G[q]) in GLn(Z/qZ) is

of the form

(cid:18) A1

0 A2 (cid:19)

0

where A1 ∈ GLn1 (Z/qZ), A2 ∈ GLn−n1 (Z/qZ). Let G = {ai,j}1≤i,j≤n; consequently,

let A1 = {ai,j}1≤i,j≤n1 and A2 = {ai,j}n1+1≤i,j≤n. Suppose that there exists a cocy-
cle {Zσ}σ∈G of G with values in (Z/qZ)n satisfying the local conditions, with Zσ =
(zσ,1, ..., zσ,n). We deﬁne two new cocycles, one of A1 with values in (Z/qZ)n1 and
the other of A2 with values in (Z/qZ)n−n1 , respectively by Zσ,A1 := (zσ,1, ..., zσ,n1) ∈
(Z/qZ)n1 and Zσ,A2 := (zσ,n1+1, ..., zσ,n) ∈ (Z/qZ)n−n1 . Since {Zσ}σ∈G satisﬁes the

local conditions, then {Zσ,A1}σ∈A1 and {Zσ,A2}σ∈A2 satisfy the local conditions too. Be-
cause of our hypothesis that H 1
loc(A1, (Z/qZ)n1 ) = 0, there exists W1 = (w1, ..., wn1 ) ∈

Decomposable actions and products of elliptic curves

(Z/qZ)n1 , such that (A1 − In1 )W1 = Zσ,A1, for all σ ∈ A1.
H 1

In the same way, since
loc(A2, (Z/qZ)n−n1 ) = 0, then there exists W2 = (wn1+1, ..., wn) ∈ (Z/qZ)n−n1 , such
that (A2 − In−n1 )W2 = Zσ,A2, for all σ ∈ A2. Let W = (w1, ..., wn1 , wn1+1, ..., wn) ∈
(Z/qZ)n. Then (G − In)W = Zσ, for all σ ∈ G. We have proved that every cocycle
of G with values in (Z/qZ)n and satisfying the local conditions is a coboundary; thus
H 1

loc(G, (Z/qZ)n) = 0.

Remark 3.2. Observe that the conclusion of Theorem 3.1 holds even if we assume

that the image of the representation of Gal(k(G[q])/k) in GLn(Z/qZ) is isomorphic to a
subgroup of GLn(pm) (for some prime p and some positive integer m) as in 3.1. It will

be just a technical assumption, that we shall use in proving Theorem 1.2.

With Lemma 3.1, the case of products of elliptic curves is easy to solve, once we know

an answer for elliptic curves; anyway it is worth to be mentioned here for completeness.

Theorem 3.3. Let k be a number ﬁeld and let E1, E2 be elliptic curves with Weierstrass
form respectively y2 = x3 + bix + ci, for i ∈ {1, 2}, where bi, ci ∈ k. Let p be a prime
number and l be a positive integer. The local-global divisibility by pl holds in the product

E1 × E2 over k if and only if it holds in both E1 over k and E2 over k.

Proof. To ease notation let G = E1 × E2. The fundamental observation is that the repre-
sentation of the Galois group Gal(k(G[pl])/k) in GL4(pl) is a group of matrices with two

diagonal blocks (each of them with 2 rows and 2 columns). It is not true in general that

the whole automorphism group of a product of elliptic curves is formed by matrices with

diagonal blocks. But this is the situation, when we restrict to automorphisms correspond-

ing to actions of Gal(k(G[pl])/k). In fact, every automorphism of G in Gal(k(G[pl])/k)

corresponds to a Galois homomorphism of the extension k(G[pl])/k, whose action on the

points of G can be viewed as a two separate actions on the points of E1 and E2 (even

when E1 = E2). We can apply Lemma 3.1 to get the conclusion.

The argument in the previous proof works also if we have an abelian variety of dimension

2n (where n is a positive integer), that is the product of n elliptic curves E1, ..., En

satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 3.3. Then, more generally, we have the following

statement.

Theorem 3.4. Let k be a number ﬁeld, let n be a positive integer and let E1, E2, ..., En be
elliptic curves with Weierstrass form respectively y2 = x3 + bix + ci, for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n},

Proof of Theorem 1.2

where bi, ci ∈ k. Let p be a prime number and l be a positive integer. The local-global
divisibility by pl holds in the product E1 × E2... × En over k if and only if holds in every

curve Ei, over k, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

By using Theorem 3.4 and [19, Corollary 2], we get the next result.

Corollary 3.5. Let k be a number ﬁeld, let n be a positive integer and let E1, E2, ..., En be
elliptic curves with Weierstrass form respectively y2 = x3 + bix + ci, for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n},

where bi, ci ∈ k. Let p be a prime number. Then there exists a number C([k : Q])

depending only on the degree [k : Q], such that, if p > C([k : Q]), then the local-global
divisibility by pl holds in the product E1 × E2... × En over k, for every positive integer l.

Furthermore, if k = Q, we can combine Theorem 3.3 with the results appearing in

[20], [18] and [5], to get a complete answer to the local-global divisibility in products of

elliptic curves deﬁned over the rationals.

Corollary 3.6. Let n be a positive integer and let E1, E2, ..., En be elliptic curves deﬁned
over Q with Weierstrass form respectively y2 = x3 + bix + ci, for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}, where
bi, ci ∈ Q. Let p be a prime number. If p ≥ 5, then the local-global divisibility by pl holds

in the product E1 × E2... × En over Q, for every positive integer l. If p ∈ {2, 3}, then the
local-global divisibility by pl holds in the product E1 × E2... × En over Q only when l = 1;

on the contrary, when l ≥ 2, there are counterexamples.

Remark 3.7. For powers of 2 (resp. powers of 3), the explicit counterexamples to the

local-global divisibility appearing in [17] and [18] give also explicit counterexamples to

the local-global divisibility by 2l (resp. 3l) in product of elliptic curves, for every l ≥ 2.

It suﬃces to take the product of E1, ..., En elliptic curves with at least one of the E ′

is being

a curve giving a counterexample.

4 Proof of Theorem 1.2

We will prove Theorem 1.2, by proving this more general statement.

Theorem 4.1. Let p be a prime number and let l, n be positive integers. Let k be a
number ﬁeld that does not contain Q(ζp + ζ −1
p ). Let G be a commutative algebraic group
deﬁned over k, such that Gal(k(G[pl])/k) is isomorphic to a subgroup of GLn(pm), for

some positive integer. For every n, there exists a prime pn, depending only on n, such
that if p > pn and the local-global divisibility by pl fails in G(k), then Gal(k(G[pl])/k)

Proof of Theorem 1.2

10

acts reducibly but not decomposably over G[pl]. In particular p1 = 2, p2 = p3 = p4 = 3,

p5 = p6 = 5, p7 = p8 = p9 = p10 = 7, p11 = p12 = 11.

To deal with powers of p instead of p will be useful when G is of type C3 (and it is
isomorphic to a subgroup of GLt(pr).Cr, with n = tr and r prime) or G is of type C5
(and it is isomorphic to a subgroup of GLt(pr), with r a prime dividing m). Clearly for

l = m = 1, the previous statement is nothing but Theorem 1.2, combined with Lemma

3.1.

We give a proof of Theorem 4.1 based on a case by case analysis of the possible

subgroups of SLn(pm), for every n ≤ 4. Then we prove the statement for a general

n, using induction for some of the classes Ci of groups. At last, we establish pn, for

5 ≤ n ≤ 12.

For n = 1, Theorem 4.1 follows directly by Artin and Tate’s result in [2], cited above.

From now on, we may then assume that n ≥ 2. Let G be a subgroup of GLn(pm) and let

eG := G ∩ SLn(pm). Since |GLn(pm)| = (pm − 1)|SLn(pm)|, then the p-Sylow subgroup
GLn(pm) and let eG := G ∩ SLn(pm). By Lemma 2.3, we have that H 1

of GLn(pm) coincides with the p-Sylow subgroup of SLn(pm). Let G be a subgroup of
loc(G, G[pm]) = 0 if

and only if H 1

We ﬁrst prove that G 6= SLn(pm).

loc(eG, G[pm]) = 0. Then, from now on we will assume that G ≤ SLn(pm).

A generalization of the Weil Pairing on elliptic curves to all abelian varieties is well-

known (see for example [4], [13] and [15]). In the same way one deﬁnes a Weil Pairing on

a commutative group G. Since the literature is lacking in showing explicitly the deﬁnition

for all commutative algebraic groups, for completeness we give it here.

Deﬁnition 4.2. (A Weil Pairing on G). Let q be a positive integer. We denote by
P ic0(G) the Picard group, i. e. the quotient of the group of the divisors on G by the

subgroup of the principal divisors. Let [q] be the multiplication-by-q map on G and let
[q]∗ be the map induced on P ic0(G) by [q]. As usual we denote by G[q]∨ ⊆ P ic0(G) the

dual of G[q]. Let P ∈ G[q], D ∈ G[q]∨ and X ∈ G. With a slight abuse of notation, we still

use D to denote a representative of the class D. Furthermore, as usual we simply denote

by qP (resp. q∗D) the image of P under [q] (resp. the image of D under [q]∗). There

are rational functions f, g on G, such that div(f ) = qD − qO and div(g) = q∗D − q∗O.

Then f ◦ [q] and gq have the same divisor and we may assume that f ◦ [q] = gh, for some

positive integer h (by eventually multiplying f by a constant from K

∗

). Therefore

The cases when n = 2 and n = 3

11

g(X + P )q = f (qX + qP ) = f (qX) = g(X)q,

and the function g(X + P )/g(X) has image in the group µq of q-th roots of the unity.

Thus we deﬁne the Weil Pairing eq : G[q] × G[q]∨ → µq on G as

eq(X, P ) :=

g(X + P )

g(X)

,

where X ∈ G is a point such that g(X + P ) and g(X) are both deﬁned and nonzero.

Exactly in the same way as for elliptic curves and abelian varieties (see for example [24]),

one can prove the following two facts.

Proposition 4.3. Let ζq be a primitive q-th root of the unity. Then

1. ζq ∈ k(G[q]);

2. σ(ζq) = ζ

We are ready to prove that G 6= SLn(pm).

p ). Then G 6=

Proof. We use the properties of the Weil Pairing described in Proposition 4.3. First of
all we have ζpl ∈ k(G[pl]), where ζpl is a primitive plth root of the unity. Let σ ∈ G,
then σ acts on ζpl via the determinant, i. e. σ(ζpl ) = ζdet(σ)
. Therefore ζpl is ﬁxed by
the whole G, i. e. ζpl ∈ k, a contradiction with our assumption that k does not contain
Q(ζp + ζ −1

pl

p ).

From now on we will often assume, without loss of generality, that G is a proper

subgroup of SLn(pm).

4.1 The cases when n = 2 and n = 3

We ﬁrst prove the statement of Theorem 1.2 for n ∈ {2, 3}.

When G . SL2(pm), the following statement can be deduced from the proof of [8,

Theorem 1].

The cases when n = 2 and n = 3

Lemma 4.5. Let k be a number ﬁeld that does not contain Q(ζp + ζ −1
p ). Let G be an
algebraic group deﬁned over k, such that Gal(k(G[pl])/k) . GL2(pm), where p > 3 is a

prime number and l, m are positive integers. If G does not admit a k-rational isogeny of

degree p, then the local-global principle holds for divisibility by pl in G over k.

In particular that results holds when l = m = 1.

Assume now that G is a commutative algebraic group such that Gal(k(G[pl])/k) .
SL3(pm). We use the classiﬁcation of the maximal subgroups of SL3(pm) appearing in

[3] and stated in next Lemma 4.6. An alternative proof could use the classiﬁcation of
the maximal subgroups of PSL3(qm) given by Mitchell for p odd (see [14]).

Lemma 4.6. Let q = pm, where p is a prime and m is a positive integer. The maximal

subgroups of SL3(q) are

(a) a subgroup of type C1, the stabilizer of a point, having order q2|GL2(q)|;

(b) a subgroup of type C1, the Borel subgroup, having order q3(q + 1)(q − 1)2;

(c) a subgroup of type C1, the stabilizer of a point and of a line whose direct sum is V ,

isomorphic to GL2(q);

(d) a subgroup of type C2, the group C2

q−1 ⋊ S3, having order 6(q − 1)2;

(e) a subgroup of type C3, a group of order 3(q2 + q + 1);

(f ) a subgroup of type C5, SL3(q0).Ch, where q = qr

0, with r prime and h = gcd( q−1

q0−1 , 3);

(g) a subgroup of type C6, 31+2

+ ⋊Q8.Ch, where p = q ≡ 1(mod3) and h = gcd(q −1, 9)/3;

(h) a subgroup of type C8, Cd × SO3(q), where q 6= 2 and d := gcd(q − 1, 3);

(i) a subgroup of type C8, Cd × SU3(q), where q odd and d := gcd(q − 1, 3);

(j) a subgroup of type C9, SL2(7) × Cd, where d := gcd(q − 1, 3);

(k) a subgroup of type C9, C .

3 A6, a subgroup of order 9 · 5!, with a normal subgroup

isomorphic to C3 and a quotient isomorphic to A6.

We also need the following classiﬁcation of the maximal subgroups of SU3(q) (see

[3]).

The cases when n = 2 and n = 3

13

Lemma 4.7. Let q = pm, where p is a prime and m is a positive integer. The maximal

subgroups of SU3(q) are

(i.1) a subgroup of type C1, the stabilizer of a point, having order q3(q2 − 1);

(i.2) a subgroup of type C1, the stabilizer of a point and of a line whose direct sum is V ,

isomorphic to GU2(q);

(i.3) a subgroup of type C2, the group C2

q+1 ⋊ S3, having order 6(q + 1)2;

(i.3) a subgroup of type C3, a group of order 3(q2 + q + 1);

(i.4) a subgroup of type C5, SU3(q0).Ch, where q = qr

0, for some odd prime r, and

h = gcd( q+1

q0+1 , 3);

(i.5) a subgroup of type C5, Cd × SO3(q), where q ≥ 7 odd and d := gcd(q − 1, 3);

(i.6) a subgroup of type C6, 31+2

+ ⋊ Q8.Ch, where p = q ≡ 2(mod 3), q ≥ 11 and h =

gcd(q + 1, 9)/3.

Proof of Theorem 4.1 for n=3. Let p > 3. Assume that G is a proper subgroup
of SL3(pm), i. e. G is contained in one of the maximal subgroups described in Lemma

4.6.

If G is either a group of type C2 (case (d)) or a group of type C3 (case (e)),

then the p-Sylow subgroup of G is trivial, implying that the p-Sylow subgroup of G
is trivial too. By Lemma 2.3, we have H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. We may also exclude case
(g), since we are assuming that p > 3. Suppose that we are in case (h). Since p > 3,
then the p-Sylow subgroup of G is contained in SO3(pm). By [3, Proposition 1.10.1], we
have SO3(pm) ≃ SL2(pm). Then we may apply Lemma 4.5 and Lemma 2.3 to conclude
H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. Again by Lemma 4.5, in case (j) we have H 1

loc(G, G[p]) = 0. Suppose
that we are in case (k). Recall that p > 3. If p ≥ 7, then Gp is trivial, implying, by
Lemma 2.3, that the ﬁrst local cohomology group H 1
then Gp is cyclic and H 1

loc(G, G[p]) is trivial too. If p = 5,
loc(G, G[p]) = 0. Suppose
that we are in case (i). Since p > 3, then the p-Sylow subgroup of G is contained in
SU3(pm). We use Lemma 4.7. Each case in that Lemma 4.7 has an analogue in Lemma
4.6 and with the same arguments as above we get H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. At last suppose
that we are in case (f ). Since p > 3, then p does not divide h and the p-Sylow subgroup
Gp of G is a subgroup of SL3(ps), for some integer s, such that n = rs, with r prime.

loc(Gp, G[pl]) = 0, implying again H 1

The case when n = 4

14

Without loss of generality we may assume that G itself is a subgroup of SL3(ps), for
some integer s, such that m = rs, with r prime. If G is still of type C5 in SL3(ps), then
we may assume that G is isomorphic to a subgroup of SL3(ps2 ), for some integer s2,

such that s = r2s2, with r2 prime. Since m is ﬁnite, then either G is trivial, or a certain
point we ﬁnd that G is isomorphic to a subgroup of SL3(psj ) (for some positive integer

sj) of class Ci, with i 6= 5. Then we may apply the arguments used above to get the

conclusion. ✷

4.2 The case when n = 4

In this section we consider commutative algebraic groups G such that Gal(k(G[pl])/k) .
SL4(pm). First of all, we recall some group isomorphisms.

Proposition 4.8 ([3], Proposition 1.10.1). The following isomorphisms hold

1) SO+

4 (q) ∼= SL2(p) × SL2(p);

2) SO−

4 (q) ∼= SL2(p2).

3) SO−

5 (q) ∼= Sp4(q).

Here is the classiﬁcation of the maximal subgroups of SL4(pm) appearing in [3].

Lemma 4.9. Let q = pm, where p is an odd prime and m is a positive integer. Let

d := gcd(q − 1, 4). The maximal subgroups of GL4(q) are

(a) a group of type C1, the stabilizer of a point, i. e. the group C3

q .GL3(q), having order

q6(q3 − 1)(q2 − 1)(q − 1)2;

(b) a group of type C1, the stabilizer of a line, having order q5(q2 − q)2(q + 1)2(q − 1)2;

(c) a group of type C1, the stabilizer of a plane, having order q6(q2 − 1)(q − 1)3;

(d) a group of type C1, a group isomorphic to GL3(q) × F∗
dimension 3), having order q3(q3 − 1)(q2 − 1)(q − 1)2;

q (that stabilizes a subspace of

(e) a group of type C2, the stabilizer of a decomposition of four subspace of dimension 1

whose direct sum is F4

q, i. e. a group of order (q − 1)44!;

(f ) a group of type C2, the stabilizer of a decomposition of two subspace of dimension 2

whose direct sum is F4

q, i. e. a group of order 2|GL2(q)| = 2q2(q2 − 1)2(q − 1)2;

The case when n = 4

15

(g) a group of type C3, a group of order 2q2(q4 − 1)(q + 1)2(q − 1), that has GL2(q2) as

a normal subgroup;

(h) a group of type C6, an extraspecial group of order 26(q − 1)6!;

(i) a group of type C6, an extraspecial group of order 25(q − 1)6!;

(j) a group of type C8, a group of order (q − 1)gcd(q − 1, 4)|SO+

4 (q)|, which has SO+

4 (q)

as a normal subgroup;

(k) a group of type C8, a group of order (q − 1)gcd(q − 1, 4)|SO−

4 (q)|, which has SO−

4 (q)

as a normal subgroup;

(l) a group of type C8, the group Γ = Sp4(q).C2 ⋊ F∗

q, such that Γ ∩ SL4(q) = Sp4(q).C2,
i. e. a group of order 2q4(q − 1)(q2 − 1)(q4 − 1), which has Sp4(q).C2 as a normal
subgroup;

(m) a group of type C9, the group A7 (only if p = 2);

(n) a group of type C9, the group Cd ◦ C ·

2SL2(7);

(o) a group of type C9, the group Cd ◦ C ·

2A7;

(p) a group of type C9, the group Cd ◦ C ·

2U4(2).

In the proof, we will also use the classiﬁcation of the maximal subgroups of the sympleptic

group Sp4(q), when q is odd (see [3]).

Lemma 4.10. q = pm, where p is an odd prime and m is a positive integer. The

maximal subgroups of Sp4(q) are

(l.1) a group of type C1, the stabilizer of a projective point, i. e. the group C3

q .GL3(q),

having order q6(q3 − 1)(q2 − 1)(q − 1)2;

(l.2) a group of type C1, the stabilizer of a projective line, having order q5(q2 − q)2(q +

1)2(q − 1)2;

(l.3) a group of type C2,, the stabilizer of a decomposition of two subspace of dimension

2 whose direct sum is F4

q, i. e. Sp2(q)2 ⋊ C2;

(l.4) a group of type C2, the group GL2(q).C2;

The case when n = 4

16

(l.5) a group of type C3, the group Sp2(q2) ⋊ C2;

(l.6) a group of type C6, an extraspecial group of order 255!;

(l.7) a group of type C6, an extraspecial group of order 245!;

(l.8) a group of type C9, the group C ·

2A6;

(l.9) a group of type C9, the group C ·

2S6;

(l.10) a group of type C9, the group C ·

2A7 (only for p = 7);

(l.11) a group of type C9, the group SL2(q).

Proof of Theorem 4.1 for n=4. Let p > 3. Without loss of generality we assume

that G is contained in a proper subgroup of SL4(p) and we use Lemma 4.9.

If we are in cases (e), then p ∤

|G|, the p-Sylow subgroup of G is trivial and

H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0.

If we are in case (h) (resp. case (i)) and p > 5, then the p-Sylow subgroup of G is
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. If we are in case (h) (resp. case (i)) and p = 5, then

trivial too and H 1
the 5-Sylow subgroup of G is cyclic and H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0.

In case (f ), the p-Sylow subgroup Gp of G has shape






where a, b ∈ Z/pZ. By Lemma 3.1, we have H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0.
In cases (j) and (k) we use the group isomorphisms listed in Proposition 4.8. Then

loc(Gp, G[pl]) = 0. Thus H 1

both cases are covered by Lemma 4.5.

In case (g), the group G is contained in a group that has a normal subgroup isomor-
phic to GL2(p2), with index not divisible by p. Observe that the p-Sylow subgroup Gp
of G is contained in G′ := GL2(p2) ∩ G . We use Lemma 4.5 to get H 1
loc(Gp, G[pl]) = 0.
Then, by Lemma 2.3, we have H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0.

Consider case (l), i. e. G is isomorphic to a subgroup of Sp4(pm).C2. Since p 6= 2,
then the p-Sylow subgroup of G is contained in Sp4(pm). To ease notation, without loss
of generality, we may assume G . Sp4(pm). If G = hI4i, then clearly H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0.
If G = Sp4(pm), then −I4 ∈ G. Since p 6= 2, then G contains a nontrivial scalar matrix

General Case

17

and, by Corollary 2.5, we have H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. Therefore, we assume that G is a
proper subgroup of Sp4(pm) and we use Lemma 4.10. In cases (l.6) and (l.7), if p > 5,
then p ∤ |G|, implying H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. If p = 5, we have that the 5-Sylow subgroup of
G is cyclic and H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0 too. Consider case (l.5). The p-Sylow subgroup Gp of
G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the p-Sylow subgroup of Sp2(pm), that is Z/p2Z. Then
Gp is cyclic and again we get H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. In cases (l.8), (l.9)
and (l.10), the p-Sylow subgroup of G is either trivial or cyclic, for all p > 3. Cases

loc(Gp, G[pl]) = H 1

(l.3), (l.4) and (l.11) are covered by Lemma 4.5.

We are left with the cases when G is of type C9 and it is not contained in Sp4(p).
In all those cases (m), (n), (o) and (p) the p-Sylow subgroup of G is either trivial or
cyclic, for all p > 3. Then H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. ✷

Corollary 4.11. Let k be a number ﬁeld and let A be an abelian variety of dimension

2. The local-global divisibility by p holds in A over k for every prime number p > 3.

4.3 General Case

We are going to prove Theorem 4.1. We use the description of the subgroups of GLn(q)

given in Table 1. We prove before the ﬁrst part of that theorem, resumed in next

proposition; then we look for explicit pn, when 5 ≤ n ≤ 12.

Proposition 4.12. Let p be an odd prime number and let l be a positive integer. Let k
be a number ﬁeld that does not contain Q(ζp + ζ −1
p ). Let G be a commutative algebraic
group deﬁned over k, such that Gal(k(G[pl])/k) is isomorphic to a subgroup of GLn(pm),

for some positive integer m. For every n, there exists a prime pn, depending only on n,
such that if p > pn and the local-global divisibility by pl fails in G(k), then Gal(k(G[pl])/k)
acts reducibly but not decomposably over G[pl].

Proof of Proposition 4.12. Let p > 2. We proceed by induction, having already

proved the statement for every n ≤ 4. Assume that the proposition holds for all integers

m < n. We will prove it for n.

Suppose that G is of type C2. Then G is the wreath product of a group G′ of matrices

with m diagonal blocks by a symmetric group Sm, with m dividing n. If p ∤ m, then
the p-Sylow subgroup of G is contained in G′. By Lemma 3.1, then H 1
loc(Gp, G[pl]) = 0.
Thus H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0 too, because of Lemma 2.3. Since m ≤ n, let pg be the greatest
prime dividing n. Then for all p > pg, we have H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0.

General Case

18

Suppose now that G is of type C3. Then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of GLt(pmr).Cr,

where r is a prime and n = tr. Let p > pg. Then p does not divide r and we may as-
sume without loss of generality that G is isomorphic to a subgroup of GLt(pmr). Since
t < n, we use induction to get H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0, for every p > max{pg, pt}, unless G
acts reducibly but not decomposably over G[p]. In particular, if ¯t is the greatest proper
divisor of n, then for all p > p¯t, we have H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0, unless G acts reducibly (but
not decomposably) over G[pl].

Suppose that G is of type C4. Then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of a central
product GLt(pm) ◦ GLr(pm) acting on a tensor product V1 ⊗ V2 = G[pl], where rt = n

and V1, V2 are vectorial spaces over Fpl, with dimension respectively t and r. We prove
the conclusion only for G ≃ GLt(pm) ◦ GLr(pm), since the proof when G is isomorphic
to a proper subgroup of GLt(pm) ◦ GLr(pm) is the same as for G being the whole central

product. Observe that this is another case that does not hold if n is a prime. Let

Zσ⊗τ , with σ ⊗ τ ∈ GLt(pm) ◦ GLr(pm) representing a cocycle of G in G[pl] with values

If Zσ⊗τ satisﬁes the local conditions, then there exists Aσ⊗τ ∈ V1 ⊗ V2
in V1 ⊗ V2.
such that Zσ⊗τ = (σ ⊗ τ − 1 ⊗ 1)Aσ⊗τ , for all σ ⊗ τ ∈ GLt(pm) ◦ GLr(pm). Observe

that Aσ⊗τ = Aσ⊗τ,1 ⊗ Aσ⊗τ,2, for some Aσ⊗τ,1 ∈ V1 and Aσ⊗τ,2 ∈ V2. We have two
separate actions of GLt(pm) on V1 and GLr(pm) on V2. Then we can construct a cocycle
Zσ := (σ − 1)Aσ, with σ ∈ GLr(pm), Aσ ∈ V1 by choosing Aσ among the possible

Aσ⊗τ,1 ∈ V1.
In the same way we can construct a cocycle Zτ := (τ − 1)Aτ , with
σ ∈ GLt(pm), Aτ ∈ V2 by Aτ among the possible Aσ⊗τ,2 ∈ V2. For the tensor product

construction, a priori we could have more than one choice of Aσ (respectively Aτ ) for each

σ (resp. τ ). Anyway, we choose just one Aσ (resp. Aτ ). We will have no problems about
this choice, because of the two separate actions of GLt(pm) and GLr(pm) on V1 and V2.

Observe that even in the general case when a cocycle of a certain group Γ (acting on a

Γ-module M ) satisﬁes the local conditions as in Deﬁnition 2.1, there could exist various

Aσ satisfying the equality Zσ = (σ − 1)Aσ. Anyway we make just one choice for Aσ ∈ M ,
for each σ ∈ Γ. Since r < n, by induction we have H 1
loc(GLr(pm), V1) = 0, for every
p > pr, unless GLr(pm) acts reducibly (but not decomposably) over V1. If GLr(pm) acts
reducibly over V1, then also GLr(pm)⊗GLt(pm) is a parabolic group and G acts reducibly
over G[pl], a contradiction with G being of class C4. Then H 1
loc(GLr(pm), V1) = 0 and
there exists A ∈ V1, such that Zσ = (σ −1)A, for all σ ∈ GLr(pm). In the same way, since
t < n, then by induction for all p > pt, we have H 1
loc(GLt(pm), V2) = 0, unless GLt(pm)

General Case

19

acts reducibly (but not decomposably) over V2. As above, if GLt(pm) acts reducibly over
V2, then also GLr(pm) ⊗ GLt(pm) is a parabolic group and G acts reducibly over G[pl], a
contradiction with G being of class C4. We have H 1
loc(GLt(pm), V2) = 0 and there exists
B ∈ V2, such that Zτ = (τ −1)B, for all τ ∈ GLt(pm). Then Zσ⊗τ = (σ ⊗τ −1⊗1)A⊗B,
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. As above, let ¯t be the greatest
for all σ ⊗ τ ∈ GLt(pm) ◦ GLr(pm) and H 1
proper divisor of n. Then for every p > p¯t, we have H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0.

If G is of class C5, then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of GLn(pt), where m = rt,
with t a positive integer and r a prime. If G is still of type C5 in GLn(pt), then G is
isomorphic to a subgroup of GLn(pt2 ), for some integer t2, such that t = r2t2, with r2

prime. Since m is ﬁnite, then either G is trivial, or G is isomorphic to a subgroup of

GLn(ptj ) (for some positive integer tj dividing m) of class Ci, with i 6= 5. We may repeat

the arguments used for other classes Ci, with i 6= 5, to get the conclusion.

Suppose that G is of class C6, i. e. G is an extraspecial group. If n is not a power
of a prime this case does not hold. Let n = rt, with r prime. If p 6= r, then the p-Sylow
subgroup of G is trivial and H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0. Observe that r = pg, then, in particular,
if p > pg, we have that H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0, for every G of type C6.

sition Nr

Assume that G is of class C7. Thus G is the stabilizer of a tensor product decompo-
i=1 Vt, with n = tr and dim(Vi) = t, for every 1 ≤ i ≤ r. By using induction on
r and the argument given in the case when G is of class C4 as the base of the induction,
we get H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) = 0, for every p > p¯t.

Suppose that G is of class C8. Since pm is odd, then G is contained either in the group

2 ),

n(pm), with ǫ ∈ {+, −} or in the group GUn(p m

Spn(pm), with n even, or in the group Oǫ
with m even. If G is one of the whole groups Spn(pm) or Oǫ
contains a non-scalar multiple of the identity. By Corollary 2.5, we have H 1

2 ), then it
loc(G, G[pl]) =
0. Suppose that G is strictly contained in one of those three groups. If G is contained in
Sph(pm) (resp. G = Oǫ
contained in Sph(pm) (resp. Oǫ
in a subgroup of type Ci, with 1 ≤ i ≤ 9 and i 6= 8. By the same arguments used in

2 )), for any h < n, we use induction. If it is not

n(pm) or GUn(p m

the cases Ci, with i 6= 8, we get the conclusion. Let ps := max{pi|i < n}. Then, for all
p > ps, we have H 1
loc(G, G[pl]) = 0, unless G acts reducibly but not decomposably over
G[pl]. Observe that ps ≥ p¯t.

For every n (similarly to the exactly known cases when n ≤ 12), there is a ﬁnite
number of subgroups of GLn(pm) of type C9. Such groups are either ﬁxed or they are

The cases when 5 ≤ n ≤ 12

20

an extension of a subgroup of GLt(pj) (for some positive integer j and some proper

divisor t of n) with a ﬁxed group or they are a product (direct, central or semidirect) of

a subgroup of GLt(pj) (for some positive integer j and some proper divisor t of n) with

a ﬁxed group. Let ph be the greatest prime dividing the order of one of the ﬁxed groups.

And let pn := max{ph, ps, pg}. By induction, if p > pn, then the p-Sylow subgroup Gp
of G is trivial and H 1

loc(G, G[q]) = 0.

We have proved that for every class Ci, with 1 ≤ i ≤ 9, if p > pn, then H 1

loc(G, G[pl]) =

0, unless G acts reducibly but not decomposably over G[pl]. ✷

4.4 The cases when 5 ≤ n ≤ 12

We will show pn, for all 5 ≤ n ≤ 12 and we prove the last sentence in Theorem

4.1. As above, we still assume that G is a commutative algebraic group such that

Gal(k(G[pl])/k) . GLn(pm), for some positive integer m.

Because of Proposition 4.12, we have just to prove the following facts.

Proposition 4.13. In the notation of Theorem 4.1, we have:

p5 = p6 = 5;

p7 = p8 = p9 = p10 = 7;

p11 = p12 = 11.

Looking at the proof of Proposition 4.12, we see that pn depends only on the primes

pi, for every i < n, on the greatest prime pg dividing n and on the subgroups of type C9.

Proof of Proposition 4.13. We use the notation adopted in the proof of Proposition

4.12.

Let n = 5. First of all, note that ps = 3. In the proof of Proposition 4.12 we have

deﬁned pg as the greatest prime dividing n, then pg = 5. Furthermore, we have deﬁned

ph as the greatest prime dividing the cardinality of a subgroup of type C9. Anyway, for
n = 5 in [3] we have the following explicit list of maximal subgroups of SL5(pm) of type

C9,

(a) subgroup of type C9, the group SL2(11) × Cd if p ≡ 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 (mod 11), a group of

order 24 · 3 · 52 · 11 · d;

REFERENCES

21

(b) subgroup of type C9, the group U4(2)×Cd, if p ≡ 1 (mod 6), a group order 26·35·5·d.

Then we may choose ph as the greatest prime dividing the cardinality of a subgroup of

type C9, such that the ph-Sylow subgroup of G is nontrivial and non cyclic. In that case

ph = 5 too. Then p5 = 5.

If n = 6, we have pg = 3. We look at the table at page 389 in [3], describing the
maximal subgroups of SL6(pm) of type C9. We may choose ph = 3, as the the greatest

prime dividing the cardinality of a subgroup of type C9, such that the ph-Sylow subgroup

of G is nontrivial and non cyclic. Then p6 = ps = p5 = 5.

If n = 7, we have pg = 7. We look at the table at page 395 in [3], describing the only
maximal subgroups of SL7(pm) of type C9, i. e. Cd × U3(3), where l = 1, p ≡ 1(mod 4)

and d = gcd(p − 1, 7). We may choose ph = 3. Since ps = p5 = 5, then p7 = pg = 7.

If n = 8, we have pg = 2. we look at the table at page 399 in [3], describing the

maximal subgroups of SL8(pm) of type C9. We have ph = 2. Then p8 = ps = p7 = 7.

If n = 9, we have pg = 3. We look at the table at page 406 in [3], describing the
maximal subgroups of SL9(pm) of type C9. Some of those subgroups are extensions or
central products of the group SL3(p2m). Then we use induction and we may choose

ph = p3 = 3. Therefore p9 = ps = p7 = 7.

If n = 10, we have pg = 5. We look at the table at page 410 in [3], describing the
maximal subgroups of SL10(pm) of type C9. As for n = 9, by using induction we may

choose ph = p5 = 5. Thus p10 = ps = p7 = 7.

If n = 11, we have pg = 11 and ps = 7. We look at the table at page 418 in [3],
describing the maximal subgroups of SL11(pm) of type C9. We may choose ph = p5 = 5.

Thus p11 = 11.

If n = 12, we have pg = 3 and ps = 11. We look at the table at page 422 in [3],
describing the maximal subgroups of SL12(pm) of type C9. We have ph = 3. Then

p12 = ps = 11. ✷
