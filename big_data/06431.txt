A ﬁtness-driven cross-diﬀusion system from

polulation dynamics as a gradient ﬂow

Stanislav Kondratyev, Léonard Monsaingeon and Dmitry Vorotnikov

Abstract

We consider a ﬁtness-driven model of dispersal of N interacting populations,
which was previously studied merely in the case N = 1. Based on some optimal
transport distance recently introduced, we identify the model as a gradient
ﬂow in the metric space of Radon measures. We prove existence of global
non-negative weak solutions to the corresponding system of parabolic PDEs,
which involves degenerate cross-diﬀusion. Under some additional hypotheses
and using a new multicomponent Poincaré-Beckner functional inequality, we
show that the solutions converge exponentially to an ideal free distribution in
the long time regime.

1 Introduction

Living organisms tend to form distributional patterns but not to be arranged either
uniformly or randomly. This spatial heterogeneity plays a crucial role in ecological
theories and their practical applications.
It should be taken into account when
modeling epidemics, ecological catastrophes, competition, adaptation, maintenance
of species diversity, parasitism, population growth and decline, social behaviour, and
so on [21]. In order to understand the way the species distribute themselves it is
important to pay attention to their dispersal strategies.

In this paper we study a system of PDEs for several interacting populations whose
dispersal strategy is determined by a local intrinsic characteristic of organisms called
ﬁtness (cf.
[10, 11]), essentially the signed diﬀerence between available resources
and their consumption by the individuals. The ﬁtness manifests itself as a growth
rate, and simultaneously aﬀects the dispersal as the species move along its gradient
towards the most favorable environment. The equilibrium when the ﬁtnesses of all
populations vanish can be referred to as the ideal free distribution [14, 13], since no
net movement of individuals occurs in this case. We are thus going to study the
system

∂tui = − div(ui∇fi) + uifi,

x ∈ Ω, t > 0,

i = 1, . . . , N,

(1.1)

of N interacting species located in a bounded domain Ω ⊂ Rd. For prescribed
resources m = (mi(x)) we assume a generic linear relation between the population
densities u = (ui(t, x)) and their corresponding ﬁtnesses f = (fi(t, x)):

f = m − Au.

(1.2)

We assume that both the matrix A and the vector m depend on x ∈ Ω, thus our
model is spatially heterogeneous. Formula (1.2) expresses the idea that the ﬁtness
is determined by the diﬀerence between the available resources m and the animals’
consumption Au.

The mathematical diﬃculties which we will face when studying the parabolic
system (1.1)-(1.2) come from the fact that it involves both cross-diﬀusion (for N > 1)
and degenerate diﬀusion. In the case of merely one population (N = 1), the ﬁtness-
driven dispersal model (1.1), (1.2) was suggested in [27, 10] and studied in [12, 18]
(see also [4]). Related ﬁtness-driven two-species models were investigated in [5, 25]
where one population uses the ﬁtness-driven dispersal strategy and the other diﬀuses
freely or does not move at all. In the case when A is a constant matrix, m ≡ 0, and
the second (reaction) term uifi in (1.1) is omitted, system (1.1), (1.2) is equivalent
to the degenerate cross diﬀusion system which was recently analyzed in [1] with

2

an application to seawater intrusion. Another population dynamics model which
involves cross-diﬀusion is the Shigesada, Kawasaki and Teramoto model

(1.3)

where the coeﬃcients are non-negative constants. It has been extensively studied
(mostly for N = 2) from the point of view of well-posedness and long-time behaviour
(see, e.g., [9, 6, 17, 16, 26, 24] and the references therein). Note that the constants
di in (1.3) are usually assumed to be strictly positive, hence this problem is not as
degenerate as our system (1.1), (1.2).

On the other hand, being inspired by the ideas of the Monge-Kantorovich optimal
transport theory [32, 33], we have recently constructed in [18] a new distance on the
space of non-negative ﬁnite Radon measures. The same distance was almost simulta-
neously introduced in the independent works [8, 22] (see also subsequent [23, 7, 15]).
This metric generates a formal (inﬁnite dimensional) Riemannian structure on this
space, and provides ﬁrst- and second-order diﬀerential calculus in the spirit of Otto
[29]. With this diﬀerential calculus at hand we were able to identify in [18] the scalar
model as a metric gradient ﬂow, which allowed us to prove long-time convergence to
the ideal free distribution with explicit exponential rates. The goal of this paper is
to extend our previous results to the multispecies case N > 1: we will observe that
the problem (1.1), (1.2) can be interpreted as a formal gradient ﬂow of some driv-
ing entropy functional on the Cartesian product of N spaces of non-negative Radon
measures with respect to this geometric structure (provided that the matrix A(x) is
symmetric). Roughly speaking, the entropy E(u) ≈ ku − u∞k2
L2(Ω) will
quantify the deviation from the ideal free distribution u∞, characterized by f = 0.
In this framework and under some general structural assumptions on A and m, we
will prove existence of non-negative weak solutions to our problem (which to the best
of our knowledge was known so far only in the scalar case [12]), and show that, at
least for subcritical initial entropies, all the species persist and exponentially con-
verge to the ideal free distribution. All our arguments will have a strong optimal
transport ﬂavor, but, due to the multicomponent nature of the problem preventing
our entropy functional from being geodesically convex, the abstract results for metric
gradient ﬂows in [2] do not apply directly. As a consequence some technical work
will be needed to justify the formal Riemannian computations and a priori estimates
(in particular some chain rules in weighted spaces), and we will argue using several
approximations and regularizations in a more standard PDE framework.

L2(Ω) ≈ kfk2

The paper is organized as follows:

In Section 2 we impose precise structural
assumptions and state our results. In Section 3 we describe the optimal transport
distance on the product measure space M+(Ω)N , discuss the induced formal Rieman-
nian structure and calculus, and highlight the gradient-ﬂow structure of the system.
We also present two formal but crucial computations, consisting of a priori entropy
and gradient estimates to be derived more rigorously later on. Section 4 is devoted to
the existence of weak solutions, whose proof will involve three successive regulariza-
tions. The last Section 5 contains the proof of the long-time convergence, based on a
new vectorial Poincaré-Beckner type inequality which serves as an entropy-entropy
production inequality for our gradient ﬂow. The Appendix contains a technical func-
tional analytic lemma.

2 Conventions and main results

Throughout the whole paper we assume that Ω ⊂ Rd is an open, connected, bounded
domain with suﬃciently smooth boundary. We always denote vector functions with
values in RN by bold letters, e.g., f = (fi(t, x)). We assume that we are given a
function m = (mi(x)) : Ω → RN and a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix function
A = (aij(x)) : Ω → RN ×N , and without further mention we shall always assume the
uniform ellipticity condition

0 < λA ≤ A(x) ≤ ΛA,

x ∈ Ω

for some structural constants λA ≤ ΛA. We assume that A and m are suﬃciently
smooth. Note that we do not assume that all the components of A and m are
non-negative.

All the integrals are always implicitly written with respect to the Lebesgue mea-
sures dx, dt, or dxdt. The symbol M+(Ω) denotes the space of (non-negative) Radon
measures on Ω. Parentheses denote the scalar product in L2(Ω), L2(Ω)N or L2(Ω)N ×d.
The symbol Cw(J ; X) stands for the space of weakly continuous (resp., narrowly
continuous) curves with deﬁned on J ⊂ R and with values in X = L2(Ω) (resp.,
X = M+(Ω)).

We study the system

As already mentioned in the introduction and without further mention, we always
denote the ﬁtness by

f = m − Au,

and the ideal free distribution u∞(x) is obtained by solving f = 0, i-e

u∞ := A−1m

⇔

f = 0.

Note that at this stage u∞ can have negative components and may therefore be
biologically irrelevant (but it will be non-negative later on with extra structural
conditions on A, m), and that u∞ is trivially a steady state of (2.1) with fi ≡ 0.

We will show in Section 3 that (2.1) is the gradient ﬂow of the entropy

Remark 2.1. We were not able to prove any uniqueness result due to the lack of
geodesic convexity, which usually gives contractivity in the metric sense and thus
uniqueness; we therefore believe that any hypothetical proof of uniqueness cannot
come from standard mass transport arguments and should rely on some PDE ap-
proach.

To ﬁx the ideas and improve readability, we assume that A does not depend on x.
The generalization to the x-dependent case would require technical work and employs

the fact that the last sum in the expansion ∇fi = ∇mi −Pj aij∇uj −Pj uj∇aij

is of lower order with respect to the penultimate one, but all the arguments below
would carry through with minor modiﬁcations.

With an additional assumption, we obtain long-time convergence u(t) → u∞ to

the ideal free distribution with survival of all the species:

Theorem 2 (long-time behavior). Let u0 be as in Theorem 1, and assume in addition
that the structural hypothesis (5.1) holds. Then u∞(x) > 0 (componentwise), and
there exists E∗ ≡ E∗(A, m) > 0 such that, for any subcritical initial datum E(u0) <
E∗, our solution u converges exponentially to u∞ as

E(u(t)) ≤ e−γtE(u0)

(2.4)

for all t ≥ 0 and some γ ≡ γ(u0, m, A, Ω) > 0.

2 ku − u∞k2

Note that our coercivity assumption A ≥ λA controls E(u) ≥ λA

L2(Ω),
thus the entropy decay (2.4) immediately implies L2 convergence. The consequences
and interpretation of the additional assumption (5.1) will be discussed later on in
Section 5. In Theorem 2 we had to restrict to subcritical entropies E(u0) < E∗ for
technical reasons, but we conjecture that (2.4) holds for any u0 ≥ 0 (unless some
component of u0 is identically zero). Indeed our proof of the long-time convergence
works provided that no extinction occurs, say kui(t)kLp(Ω) ≥ ci > 0 for all i ∈
{1, . . . , N}, t ≥ 0, and some p ≥ 1. For both the ODE dynamics (i-e when all
densities and resources are constant in space) and for the one-animal PDE dynamics
[12, 18] this is true, but due to the cross-diﬀusion we were not able to prove the
non-extinction in the general case. In other words, our subcriticality assumption in
Theorem 2 is a technical workaround guaranteeing that our solution stays away from
a ﬁnite number of certain partial extinction regimes. These regimes correspond to
the situations when some (or all) populations go extinct, and the survivors compose
a (lower-dimensional) ideal free distribution. This allows us to provide an explicit
value for E∗ depending only on the structure of the problem, see Section 5 for the
details.

3 The gradient-ﬂow structure and a priori estimates

The celebrated Benamou-Brenier formula was originally established in [3] to charac-
terize the quadratic Monge-Kantorovich-Wasserstein distance as a dynamical evolu-
tion problem, and is restricted to conservative optimal transport of measures with
ﬁxed mass (typically probability measures). In [18] we constructed an optimal trans-
port distance d on the space of arbitrary non-negative Radon measures M+(Ω),
based on a modiﬁed dynamical Benamou-Brenier formula allowing for mass varia-
tions. More precisely, for any u0, u1 ∈ M+(Ω) the distance reads

d2(u0, u1) = min

(u,g)Z 1
0 ZΩ

(|∇gt(x)|2 + |gt(x)|2)dut(x)dt,

where the inﬁmum is taken among narrowly continuous curves

t 7→ ut ∈ Cw([0, 1]; M+(Ω))

with endpoints u0, u1 such that the non conservative continuity equation

∂tut + div(ut∇gt) = utgt

holds in the sense of distributions D′((0, 1) × Ω). Biologically, one can think of g
as ﬁtness: in the continuity equation above the individuals u reproduce or die with
rate g equal to the local ﬁtness, and move along the velocity ﬁeld ∇g towards the
most favorable environment. Our construction was originally derived in the whole
space Ω = Rd, but immediately extends to general domains imposing natural zero-
ﬂux boundary conditions on the velocity ﬁelds ∇gt on ∂Ω.
In addition to nice
geometrical and topological properties (completeness, existence of geodesics, lower
semi-continuity with respect to weak-∗ convergence, characterization of Lipschitz
curves...) the metric d gives a formal Riemannian structure à la Otto [29] on the
space M+(Ω), endowing the tangent plane

TuM+ = {∂tu = ζ :

ζ = − div(u∇g) + ug,

g ∈ H 1(du) through the elliptic equation − div(u∇g) + ug = ζ (supplemented with
zero-ﬂux boundary conditions on ∂Ω if needed). In particular this allows to compute

metric gradients for functionals F (u) =RΩ F (x, u) on M+ as

8

At this stage let us derive two formal estimates, which will be crucial for the
subsequent analysis. Here we ignore all the regularity issues, and we shall make
these estimates rigorous throughout the several regularized problems involved in the
proof of existence. The ﬁrst estimate is the Entropy-Dissipation-Inequality (2.3), and
is inherent to the gradient-ﬂow structure. Indeed from (3.3) we should have along
reasonably smooth solutions that

dE

=(cid:28)gradD E(u),

dt(cid:29)Tu(M+)N

Tu(M+)N .

Given the above deﬁnition of the tangent norms and the explicit computation of the
metric gradient in terms of the ﬁtness, this reads in our setting

E(u(t1)) +Xi Z t1
t0 ZΩ

ui(|∇fi|2 + |fi|2) = E(u(t0))

for all 0 ≤ t0 ≤ t1.

This is often referred to as the Entropy-Dissipation-Equality for the obvious reasons,
and implies of course (2.3). However the latter inequality is well known to still
completely characterize metric gradient ﬂows [2], and will turn out to be more ﬂexible
and easier to obtain rigorously along the various approximations.

The second fundamental estimate, which will serve as a technical tool, is the a

priori gradient estimate

k∇uk2

L2(0,T ;L2(Ω)N ×d) ≤ C(1 + T )

and can be viewed as a “ﬂow interchange” estimate as introduced in [28]. Indeed the
estimate formally follows from computing the dissipation of the Boltzmann entropy

H(ui) =RΩ{ui log ui − ui + 1} along solutions of our PDE, which is the gradient ﬂow

of the driving functional E. More precisely, testing log ui in (2.1) (recall that our
weak solutions will be non-negative) we compute

Writing fi = mi − (Au)i in the last gradient term, summing over i’s, and integrating

4 Existence of weak solutions

Our construction of weak solutions will involve three levels of approximation, indexed
by the regularization parameters ε, δ → 0 and M → ∞. More precisely, we shall
consider the regularized problems

(cid:26) ∂tui + ε(Au)i = − div(˜ui∇fi) + ˜uifi + δ∆ui,

ui(0, x) = u0

i (x)

with f = m − Au.

(4.1)

Here

˜ui = max(0, min(M, ui))

is the truncation between 0 and M ≫ 1. The operator A is a suitable elliptic
operator of higher order to be precised shortly together with its associated boundary
conditions, and will essentially allow to consider the second-order cross diﬀusion as a
compact perturbation of εA for ﬁxed ε > 0. Note that in the original PDEs the terms
ui∇fi only belong to L1(Ω) if u ∈ H 1(Ω)N , while the truncations ˜ui∇ui ∈ L2(Ω)
behave much better for ﬁxed M < ∞. Lastly, the δ∆ term will help to gain coercivity
and control the degenerate cross-diﬀusion.

10

We shall ﬁrst take ε → 0, then M → ∞, and ﬁnally δ → 0 in this order. The
most delicate limit will be M → ∞, when we loose the regularity ˜ui∇fi ∈ L2(Ω)
to the more delicate ui∇fi ∈ L1(Ω). This step will also require the rigorous jus-
tiﬁcation of the formal computations and chain rules from Section 3, and will be
the most involved. It is worth pointing out that solutions will become non-negative
ui(t, x) ≥ 0 only after taking ε → 0, which will then carry through the next limits
M → ∞, δ → 0. For convenience we will work in ﬁnite time intervals [0, T ]. All
our estimates will give local-in time control, and we will retrieve in the end a global
solution by standard diagonal extraction.
In order to keep the notation light we
omit the ε, M, δ indexes as often as possible, and throughout the manuscript we will
precise the dependence of the solution on the regularizing parameters when needed.

Our ﬁrst step is to prove existence of solutions to (4.1) for small ε, δ > 0 and large
M < ∞ in any ﬁxed time interval [0, T ]. In order to give a precise meaning to this
problem, consider the Hilbert triple (see the Appendix for the abstract deﬁnition)

for ﬁxed r > 1 +

d

.

Denote by A the Riesz isometry between the spaces (H r)N and ((H r)∗)N . We recall
the Sobolev embedding H r(Ω) ⊂ C1(Ω), which is compact.

The weak form of (4.1) (with a certain implicit higher-order Neumann boundary

condition which is of no importance to us) is the following Cauchy problem

u′ + εAu = Q(u),

u|t=0 = u0,

(4.2)

where the ﬁrst equality is understood as an ODE in the space ((H r)∗)N and the initial
datum should be taken in the sense of C([0, T ]; (L2)N ). The operator Q : (H 1)N →
((H 1)∗)N is determined by duality as

hQ(u), wi =

N

Xi=1 ZΩ

(˜ui∇fi · ∇wi + ˜uifiwi − δ∇ui · ∇wi) ,

∀w ∈ (H 1)N .

Note that, for ﬁxed M > 0, the operator Q has sublinear growth and is continuous
from C1(Ω)N to ((H r)∗)N . By Lemma 5.1 with X = H r(Ω)N , V = C1(Ω)N , Y =
L2(Ω)N , there exists a solution u to (4.2) in the class

L2(0, T ; (H r)N ) ∩ H 1(0, T ; ((H r)∗)N ) ∩ C([0, T ]; (L2)N )

for any ﬁxed T > 0.

In order to send

uεk ⇀ u weakly in L2(0, T ; (H 1)N ) and weakly-* in L∞(0, T ; (L2)N ),

uεk → u strongly in L2(0, T ; (L2)N ) and in C([0, T ]; ((H 1)∗)N ),

(uεk)′ ⇀ u′ weakly in L2(0, T ; ((H r)∗)N ).

12

By the classical continuity property [20] of Nemytskii truncations,

˜uεk → ˜u strongly in L2(0, T ; (L2)N ),

and because f εk = m − Auεk → m − Au = f strongly in L2(0, T ; (L2)N ) and weakly
in L2(0, T ; H 1) the products

By density it is easy to check that u′ ∈ L2(0, T ; ((H 1)∗)N ), and the ﬁrst equality in
(4.9) holds in the space (H 1)∗)N for a.e. t. By standard Lions-Magenes interpolation
results [35, Lemma 2.2.7] we have moreover u ∈ C([0, T ]; (L2)N ).

We now show non-negativity of our weak solution u = lim uεk to (4.10) and
derive a priori L2(0, T ; (H 1)N ) estimates uniformly in M, δ, which will allow to take
the limit M → ∞, δ → 0 in the next sections. After the previous limit ε → 0
the solution u belongs at this stage to C([0, T ]; (L2)N ) ∩ L2(0, T ; (H 1)N ) for ﬁxed
M, δ > 0. Therefore we can take again −f as a test function and repeat the previous
computations (4.4)(4.5) with now ε = 0, and we get similarly

wherever vi = min{ui, 0} 6= 0 and ∇vi = ∇uiχ[ui<0]
6= 0 so that the ﬁrst two
integrands in the middle term are identically zero. Since we consider non-negative
initial data u0

i ≥ 0 we have vi(0, .) = 0, thus vi(t, .) = 0 for all later times and

vi = min{0, ui} ≡ 0

⇒

ui(t, x) ≥ 0 a.e. in (0, T ) × Ω.

From now on we slightly abuse the notation and still write ˜ui = min{ui, M} ≥ 0 for
the upper truncation only, which is justiﬁed since we just proved that ui ≥ 0.

In order to mimic the formal gradient estimate from Section 3, we would like
to test log ui in (4.10). However this is not rigorous because log ui may not be an
admissible test function. We use instead the truncated logarithm and Boltzmann
entropy, deﬁned as

estimates will be uniform in δ, M, and all the constants CT below will depend on the

For ﬁxed 0 < ζ < M < ∞ the functions logM

In order to estimate the time derivative, let us recall that the weak formulation
of (4.10) holds in duality with all C1(Ω) (actually, even H 1) test functions. Since
kukL∞(0,T ;(L2)N ) ≤ CT and we just proved that k∇ukL2(0,T ;(L2)N ×d) ≤ CT we see that
the products ˜ui∇fi and ˜uifi are bounded respectively in L2(0, T ; L1) and L∞(0, T ; L1)
uniformly in δ, M. We conclude by duality in (4.10) that ∂tui = − div(˜ui∇fi)+ ˜uifi +
δ∆ui is bounded in L2(0, T ; (C1(Ω)∗)N ). To summarize, the solution u = lim uεk of
(4.10) has the regularity

ku′kL2(0,T ;(C1(Ω)∗)N ) + kukL∞(0,T ;(L2)N ) + kukL2(0,T ;(H 1)N ) ≤ CT

(4.12)

uniformly in M, δ.

4.2 The limit M → ∞

Here we want to pass to the limit M → +∞ in (4.9) and (4.10) for ﬁxed δ > 0.

Deﬁne the limit operator Q∞ : (H 1)N → ((C1(Ω))∗)N by

hQ∞(u), wi =

N

Xi=1 ZΩ

(ui∇fi · ∇wi + uifiwi − δ∇ui · ∇wi) ,

∀w ∈ C1(Ω)N .

By (4.12), the Banach-Alaoglu theorem and Aubin-Lions-Simon lemma, there exists
a sequence Mk → +∞ (δ > 0 is ﬁxed) such that, for the corresponding solutions
uMk, we have

uMk ⇀ u weakly in L2(0, T ; (H 1)N ) and weakly-* in L∞(0, T ; (L2)N ),

uMk → u strongly in L2(0, T ; (L2)N ) and in C([0, T ]; ((H 1)∗)N ),

(uMk )′ ⇀ u′ weakly-* in L2(0, T ; (C1(Ω)∗)N )

with

ku′kL2(0,T ;(C1(Ω)∗)N ) + kukL∞(0,T ;(L2)N ) + kukL2(0,T ;(H 1)N ) ≤ CT

(4.13)

(uniformly in δ). Because the truncation operator z 7→ ˜z = min{z, M} is 1-Lipschitz
uniformly in M and uMk

i → ui strongly in L2, one readily checks that

˜uMk

i = minnuMk

in the sense of scalar distributions. Moreover, by the Lions-Magenes lemma [35,
Lemma 2.2.6] we see that u ∈ Cw([0, T ]; (L2)N ), hence the initial condition is taken
in Cw([0, T ]; (L2)N ).

Before moving to the next limit δ → 0, we need to show that the dissipation esti-
mate (4.11) also passes to the limit Mk → ∞ . This is not straightforward because of
the cubic products ˜ui(|∇fi|2 + |fi|2), as ˜uMk
does not a priori converge uniformly and
f Mk
should not converge strongly in L2(0, T ; H 1). In order to circumvent this tech-
i
nical diﬃculty we use a variant of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem in varying L2(dµk)
spaces:

i

Lemma 4.1 (compactness of vector-ﬁelds). Let O ⊂ Rp be an open set, {µk}k≥0 a
sequence of ﬁnite non-negative Radon measures narrowly converging to µ, and vk a
sequence of vector ﬁelds on O. If

then there exists v ∈ L2(O, dµ) such that, up to extraction of some subsequence,

kvkkL2(O,dµk) ≤ C

and

∀ ζ ∈ C∞

kvkkL2(O,dµk).

17

The proof of this fact by optimal transport techniques can be found in [2]; this
lemma also follows from a variant of the Banach-Alaoglu theorem [18, Proposition
5.3]. We will apply this lemma component by component with O = (t0, t1)×Ω ⊂ Rd+1
for ﬁxed 0 ≤ t0 ≤ t1 ≤ T and the sequence of measures dµk(t, x) := ˜uMk
(t, x)dxdt,
which converges narrowly to dµ(t, x) = ui(t, x)dxdt due to the strong L2(QT ) con-
vergence ˜uMk
i → ui. The vector-ﬁelds of interest are of course the Rd-valued ∇f Mk
and the scalar f Mk

. Indeed, for ﬁxed 0 ≤ t0 ≤ t1 ≤ T we have by (4.11) that

4.3 The limit δ → 0

We are now ready to pass to the last limit δ → 0. By (4.13) we can ﬁnd a sequence
δk → 0 such that, for the corresponding solutions uδk to (4.14), we have

uδk ⇀ u weakly in L2(0, T ; (H 1)N ) and weakly-* in L∞(0, T ; (L2)N ),

uδk → u strongly in L2(0, T ; (L2)N ) and in C([0, T ]; ((H 1)∗)N ),

(uδk)′ ⇀ u′ weakly-* in L2(0, T ; (C1(Ω)∗)N )

for every ﬁxed T > 0. Arguing as before for the products uδk
i we can
take the strong-weak limits, and the δ∆ui term in (4.14) goes weakly to zero due to
the L2(0, T ; H 1) bound. Similarly to the previous step, u ∈ Cw([0, T ]; (L2)N ), and
we can pass to the limit in the initial condition. Thus the limit u is a weak solution
to the original problem (2.1). By standard diagonal extraction arguments it is easy
to see that u = lim uδk can be chosen independent of the ﬁxed time T > 0. Thus the
above convergence holds locally in time in [0, ∞), the weak solution is global, and
has the desired regularity in any ﬁnite time interval.

5 Long-time convergence

This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 2, and without further mention we
assume that for any I = {i1, . . . , ir} ⊂ {1, . . . , N}, i1 < · · · < ir, and j /∈ I there
holds

(x) ≥ κ

for some constant κ ≡ κ(A, m) > 0.

Remark 5.1. Letting I = ∅ in (5.1), we see that necessarily mj(x) ≥ κ > 0 for any
j and x ∈ Ω, which means that there are only positive resources.

19

With this assumption, some elementary algebra shows in particular that the ideal

free distribution

u∞(x) = A−1m(x) ≥ cκ > 0

becomes now a biologically relevant (non-negative) coexistence steady state of (2.1)
with f ≡ 0. This particular distribution is clearly mathematically signiﬁcant given
the deﬁnition of the entropy (2.2), and we shall prove below that it also attracts the
long-time dynamics as in Theorem 2. However, (5.1) also implies the existence of a
ﬁnite number of non-negative partial extinction steady states constructed as follows:
given any I ⊂ {1, . . . , N} and recalling that by deﬁnition f = m − Au, it is easy to
see from (5.1) that the linear system

(cid:26) ui = 0

fj = 0

(i ∈ I)
(j /∈ I),

has a unique solution uI(x) satisfying uj(x) ≥ cκ > 0 for all j 6∈ I (thus uI(x) > 0
componentwise). Note that those uI are trivially steady states of (2.1) with (ui)i∈I ≡
0 and (fj)j6∈I ≡ 0, and that the ideal free distribution u∞ = u∅ is the unique
coexistence state obtained by taking I = ∅ ⇔ f = 0. In fact our condition (5.1) is
equivalent to the hypothesis that all the components (uI
j )j6∈J of those steady states
are positive and uniformly bounded away from zero, cf. [19] (by deﬁnition the other
components (uI

i )i∈I vanish identically).

The partial extinction set is then the collection of all such stationary solutions
uI(x) for all possible choices of I ⊂ {1, . . . , N} with I 6= ∅, of which there is a ﬁnite
combinatorial number pN :

Uext = {uext,1(x), . . . , uext,pN (x)} = {uI(x) : ∅ 6= I ⊂ {1, . . . , N}} ⊂ H 1(Ω)N .

The critical entropy E∗ > 0 appearing in Theorem 2 is then deﬁned as the minimal
entropy among all the partial extinction states,

and depends only on A, m (and Ω).

E∗ = min(cid:8)E(uext) :

uext ∈ Uext(cid:9) ,

(5.2)

Though biologically admissible, the partial extinction states are actually degen-
erate points in our analysis: whenever ui(x) ≡ 0, the formal Riemannian structure
from Section 3 degenerates since the i-th tangent plane TuiM+ = {0} becomes triv-
ial, see in particular the deﬁnition of tangent norms (3.1) in terms of k.kH 1(du) norms.
As a consequence we will need to stay away from those points. This is particularly
clear in the following functional inequality, which will be the key to proving the long-
time convergence below and follows from a more general Poincaré-Beckner inequality
established by us in [19]:

20

Theorem 3. Let U ⊂ H 1(Ω, RN ) be a set of functions such that

(i) u ≥ 0 for any u ∈ U;

(ii) no sequence {uk}k≥0 ⊂ U converges strongly in Lq(Ω)N to any of the partial

extinction states uext ∈ Uext for some q ∈ [1, 2).

Then there exists a constant CU > 0 such that

∀ u ∈ U :

ZΩ

N

Xi=1

|fi|2 dx ≤ CUZΩ

N

Xi=1

ui(|fi|2 + |∇fi|2) dx.

(5.3)

Remark 5.2. Apart from U, the constant CU also depends on the upper bounds for
|m| and |A|, on λA, and on κ in (5.1).

Condition (ii) means that the U must be separated from the ﬁnite set of par-
tial extinction points Uext. Moreover, this Poincaré-type inequality can be rein-
terpreted as an entropy-entropy production inequality, as is common in the frame-
work of gradient ﬂows in Wasserstein spaces. Indeed from Section 3 and the formal
Riemannian structure the right-hand side is nothing but the dissipation D(u) =
k gradD E(u)k2
L2(Ω) from the coercivity, the left hand
side controls E(u) = E(u) − E(u∞). Thus (5.3) gives the entropy-entropy dissipa-
tion control D(u) ≥ C(E(u) − E(u∞)), which classically implies convergence in the
entropy sense.

TuM+, and recalling E(u) . kfk2

We are now in position of proving the long-time convergence:

Proof of Theorem 2. Recalling the deﬁnition of the critical entropy (5.2) and given
a subcritical initial data

E(u0) < E∗,

ui ≥ 0,

ui ∈ H 1(Ω),

E(u) ≤ E(u0)(cid:9)

we introduce the set

U :=(cid:8)u = (u1, . . . , uN ) :

(depending only on u0, A, m, and Ω). From the EDI (2.3) we see that we have
invariance

u(0) = u0 ∈ U ⇒ u(t) ∈ U for a.a. t ≥ 0

along the time-evolution, and we claim that U meets the assumptions of Theorem 3.
To see this, assume by contradiction that there is a sequence uk ∈ U such that
uk → uext strongly in Lq(Ω) for some partial extinction state uext ∈ Uext and some

21

2 kuk − u∞k2

q ∈ [1, 2). Since λA
L2(Ω) ≤ E(uk) ≤ E(u0) we see that {uk} is bounded in
L2(Ω), and up to extraction of a subsequence we can therefore assume that uk ⇀ u
weakly in L2 for some limit u. By uniqueness of the limit we see that u = uext, and
by lower semi-continuity

E(uext) ≤ lim inf
k→∞

E(uk) ≤ E(u0) < E∗.

This is impossible by the deﬁnition (5.2) of E∗, which entails the claim.

From (2.2) and the coercivity A ≥ λA we recall that E(u) ≤ CARΩ |f|2. We can

therefore apply Theorem 3 in the Entropy-Dissipation-Inequality (2.3) and conclude
that there is γ = γU > 0, depending only on E(u0) and the data, such that for a.e.
t ≥ t0 ≥ 0 there holds

E(u(s))ds ≤ E(u(t)) +Xi Z t
t0 ZΩ

(|∇fi|2 + |fi|2)ui ≤ E(u(t0)).

E(u(t)) + γZ t
Hence t 7→ E(u(t)) + γR t

t0

0 E(u(s))ds is monotone non-increasing, and therefore

dE
dt

+ γE ≤ 0

in the sense of scalar distributions D′(0, ∞). This immediately implies the ex-
ponential decay (2.4) for a.e t by a standard Grönwall argument. Finally, since
u ∈ Cw([0, ∞); L2(Ω)N ), the function t 7→ E(u(t)) is lower semicontinuous, and (2.4)
extends to all t ≥ 0.

Remark 5.3. From the biological perspective, the distributions uI (I 6= ∅) describe
scenarios when some of the species (ui)i∈I have died out, and the survivors (uj)j6∈J
compose a (lower-dimensional) ideal free distribution. It is important to point out
that these partial ideal free distributions (which we need to avoid to secure the entropy-
entropy production inequality) are unstable and repulsive: if a small L∞ density of
any of the extinct populations (ui)i∈I is reintroduced, its ﬁtness fi will be positive
and bounded away from zero (see [19]), therefore the environment is favorable to that
species and it will unlikely go extinct again. That is why we conjecture that (2.4)
holds for any u0 ≥ 0 (unless some component of u0 is identically zero).

Appendix

Assume that X ⊂ Y are two Hilbert spaces, with continuous embedding operator
i : X → Y , and that i(X) is dense in Y . The adjoint operator i∗ : Y ∗ → X ∗ is
continuous and, since i(X) is dense in Y , one-to-one. Since i is one-to-one, i∗(Y ∗)
is dense in X ∗, and one may identify Y ∗ with a dense subspace of X ∗. Due to the
Riesz representation theorem, one may also identify Y with Y ∗. We arrive at the
chain of inclusions:

X ⊂ Y ≡ Y ∗ ⊂ X ∗

(5.4)

with dense and continuous embeddings. Observe that in this situation, for f ∈ Y, u ∈
X, their scalar product in Y coincides with the < X ∗, X > duality

(f, u)Y = hf, uiX ∗,X.

(5.5)

Such triples (X, Y, X ∗) are called Hilbert triples (sometimes also referred to as Gelfand
or Lions triples), see, e.g., [31, 35] for more details.

Lemma 5.1. Let

X ⊂ Y ⊂ X ∗

be a Hilbert triple. Let A : X → X ∗ be a linear continuous operator such that

hAu, ui ≥ αkuk2
X

for all u ∈ X and some common α > 0. Let V be a Banach space such that

X ⊂ V ⊂ Y

where the ﬁrst embedding is compact and the second is continuous. Assume that both
X and V are separable. Let

be a continuous operator. Assume that

Q : V → X ∗

kQ(u)kX ∗ ≤ C(1 + kukV )

(5.6)

23

for all u ∈ X. Then the Cauchy problem

u′(t) + Au(t) = Q(u(t)),

u|t=0 = u0,

has a solution in the class

L2(0, T ; X) ∩ H 1(0, T ; X ∗) ∩ C([0, T ]; Y )

for every u0 ∈ Y .

(5.7)

(5.8)

We omit the proof since a more general statement is proven in [30], cf. also [35,

Section 6.3], [34, Section 4].
