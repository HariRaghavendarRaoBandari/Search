Chimera states are complex spatio-temporal patterns that consist of coexisting domains of coherent and
incoherent dynamics. We analyse chimera states in networks of Van der Pol oscillators with hierarchical
coupling topology. We investigate the stepwise transition from a nonlocal to a hierarchical topology, and
propose the network clustering coeﬃcient as a measure to establish a link between the existence of chimera
states and the compactness of the initial base pattern of a hierarchical topology; we show that a large clustering
coeﬃcient promotes the occurrence of chimeras. Depending on the level of hierarchy and base pattern, we
obtain chimera states with diﬀerent numbers of incoherent domains. We investigate the chimera regimes as
a function of coupling strength and nonlinearity parameter of the individual oscillators. The analysis of a
network with larger base pattern resulting in larger clustering coeﬃcient reveals two diﬀerent types of chimera
states and highlights the increasing role of amplitude dynamics.

Chimera states are an example of intriguing par-
tial synchronization patterns appearing in net-
works of identical oscillators with complex cou-
pling schemes. They exhibit a hybrid structure
combining coexisting spatial domains of coherent
(synchronized) and incoherent (desynchronized)
dynamics, and were ﬁrst reported for the model of
phase oscillators1,2. Recent studies have demon-
strated the emergence of chimera states in a vari-
ety of topologies, and for diﬀerent types of in-
dividual dynamics.
In this paper, the transi-
tion from nonlocal to hierarchical (quasi-fractal)
topologies is studied systematically in a network
of identical Van der Pol oscillators. The clus-
tering coeﬃcient and symmetry properties are
used to classify diﬀerent topologies with respect
to the occurrence of chimera states. We show that
symmetric topologies with large clustering coeﬃ-
cients promote the emergence of chimera states,
while they are suppressed by slight topological
asymmetries or small clustering coeﬃcient.

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of coupled oscillatory systems is an impor-
tant research ﬁeld bridging between nonlinear dynamics,
network science, and statistical physics, with a variety of
applications in physics, biology, and technology3,4. The
study of large networks with complex coupling schemes
continues to open up new unexpected dynamical scenar-
ios.

The last decade has seen an increasing interest in
chimera states in dynamical networks5–13. First obtained
in the systems of phase oscillators, chimeras can also be
found in a large variety of diﬀerent systems including
time-discrete maps14,15, time-continuous chaotic mod-
els16, neural systems17–20, Boolean networks21, popula-
tion dynamics22, Van der Pol oscillators23, and quantum
oscillator systems24. Moreover, chimera states allow for
higher spatial dimensions8,12,25–29. Together with the ini-
tially reported chimera states, which consist of one coher-
ent and one incoherent domain, new types of these pecu-
liar states having multiple incoherent regions17,19,23,30–32,
as well as amplitude-mediated33,34, and pure amplitude
chimera and chimera death states35 were discovered.

In many systems, the form of the coupling deﬁnes
the possibility to obtain chimera states. The nonlo-
cal coupling has generally been assumed to be a nec-
essary condition for chimera states to evolve in cou-
pled systems. However, recent studies have shown that
even global all-to-all coupling34,36–38, as well as more
complex coupling topologies allow for the existence of
chimera states20,22,39–44. Furthermore, time-varying net-
work structures can give rise to alternating chimera
states45. Chimera states have also been shown to be ro-
bust against inhomogeneities of the local dynamics and
coupling topology44,46, as well as against noise47, or they
might even be induced by noise48,49.

Possible applications of chimera states in natural and
technological systems include the phenomenon of uni-
hemispheric sleep50, bump states in neural systems51,52,
epileptic seizures53, power grids54, or social systems55.
Many works considering chimera states have mostly been
based on numerical results. A deeper bifurcation analy-
sis56 and even a possibility to control chimera states57–59
were obtained only recently.

The experimental veriﬁcation of chimera states was
ﬁrst demonstrated in optical60 and chemical61,62 sys-
Further experiments involved mechanical63,64,

electronic65,66, optoelectronic delayed-feedback67 and
electrochemical68–70 oscillator systems, Boolean net-
works21, and optical combs71.

Recent results in the area of neuroscience increased the
interest in irregular coupling topologies. Diﬀusion Tensor
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI) studies revealed
an intricate architecture in the neuron interconnectivity
of the human and mammalian brain: the connectivity
of the neuron axons network represents a hierarchical
(quasi-fractal) geometry with fractal dimensions varying
between 2.3 and 2.8, depending on the local properties,
on the subject, and on the noise reduction threshold72–76.
Motivated by these studies, the goal of the present
manuscript is to analyze diﬀerent networks with hierar-
chical connectivity and systematically explore the mech-
anisms of formation of chimera states in such networks.
We aim to uncover characteristic measures of the hier-
archical connectivities which determine the emergence of
chimeras. As a key measure we identify the clustering
coeﬃcient. We focus on the stepwise transition of net-
work topology from nonlocal to hierarchical, and analyze
diﬀerent types of chimera states that can arise in sys-
tems with diﬀerent numbers of hierarchical steps. The
dynamics of individual units in the network is governed
by the Van der Pol oscillator77, which has a long history
of being used in both the physical and biological sciences,
and allows for a continuous transition between sinusoidal
and strongly nonlinear relaxation oscillations by tuning
a single parameter.

II. THE MODEL

In our study, we consider a system of N identical Van
der Pol oscillators with varying ring topologies, which
are given by the respective adjacency matrices G. The
dynamical equations for the 2-dimensional phase space
variable xk = (uk, ˙uk)T = (uk, vk)T ∈ R2 are:

˙xi(t) = F (xi(t)) +

σ
g

GijH(xj − xi)

with i ∈ {1, ..., N}. The dynamics of each individual
oscillator is governed by

N(cid:88)

j=1

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

F (x) =

where ε denotes the bifurcation parameter. The uncou-
pled Van der Pol oscillator has a stable ﬁxed point at
x = 0 for ε < 0 and undergoes an Andronov-Hopf bi-
furcation at ε = 0. Here, only ε > 0 is considered.
The parameter σ denotes the coupling strength, and
j=1 Gij is the number of links for each node (corre-
sponding to the row sum of G). The local interaction is
realized as diﬀusive coupling with local coupling matrix

the manuscript we ﬁx parameters b1 = 1.0 and b2 = 0.1,
which allows us to observe chimera states in nonlocally
coupled systems.

A. An algorithm to construct hierarchical topologies

Hierarchical topologies can be generated using a clas-
sical Cantor construction algorithm for a fractal set78,79.
This iterative hierarchical procedure starts from a base
pattern or initiation string binit of length b, where each
element represents either a link (’1’) or a gap (’0’). The
number of links contained in binit is referred to as c1.
In each iterative step, each link is replaced by the initial
base pattern, while each gap is replaced by b gaps. Thus,
each iteration increases the size of the ﬁnal bit pattern,
such that after n iterations the total length is N = bn.
Since the hierarchy is truncated at a ﬁnite n, we call the
resulting pattern hierarchical rather than fractal. Using
the resulting string as the fundamental row of the circu-
lant adjacency matrix G, a ring network of N = bn nodes
with hierarchical topology is generated20,22,44. Here we
will slightly modify this procedure by adding an addi-
tional zero in the ﬁrst instance of the sequence, which
corresponds to the self-coupling. Note that the diﬀusive
coupling scheme in Eq.(1) cancels out any instantaneous
self-coupling. Therefore there is no net eﬀect of the diag-
onal elements of the adjacency matrix Gii on the network
dynamics, and hence the ﬁrst link in the clockwise sense
from the reference node is eﬀectively removed from the
link pattern. Without our modiﬁcation, this would lead
to a breaking of the base pattern symmetry, i.e., if the
base pattern is symmetric, the resulting coupling topol-
ogy would not be so, since the ﬁrst link to the right is
missing from the ﬁnal link pattern. Our procedure, in
contrast, ensures the preservation of an initial symmetry
of binit in the ﬁnal link pattern, which is crucial for the
observation of chimera states, since asymmetric coupling
leads to a drift of the chimera59. Thus a ring network of
N = bn + 1 nodes is generated.

While fully hierarchical topologies can be generated us-
ing this classical construction algorithm, a further modiﬁ-
cation allows us to study systematically the transition be-
tween nonlocal and hierarchical topologies via a stepwise
iteration process. Nonlocal coupling schemes have widely
been used in the context of chimera state research23 and
do therefore provide a good reference point to compare
hierarchical networks to.

A nonlocal topology can be generated from a base pat-
tern binit of length b, which contains an equal number of
links only at its beginning and end (for instance (101)
or (110011)). The link pattern is then expanded to a
predetermined system size N = bn + 1, corresponding to
the ﬁnal size of a fully hierarchical topology, by replacing
each element with N−1
copies of itself and again adding
the additional zero in ﬁrst instance of the ﬁnal pattern.
Thus, a suitable base pattern binit can be used to either

and the ﬁnal 1-step hierarchical system corresponds to nonlocal coupling where each element is coupled to its R = 9 nearest

construct a fully hierarchical or a nonlocal topology. The
stepwise transition between these two types of topologies
is realized as follows: First, binit is iterated m times ac-
cording to the Cantor construction process, generating a
pattern of size bm. Afterwards, this pattern is expanded
to the ﬁnal size N by replacing each element with N−1
bm
copies of itself. The initial base pattern binit = (101) and
a predetermined system size of N = 27 + 1 (b = 3, n = 3)
provide a simple example. The resulting coupling topolo-
gies are illustrated in Fig. 1. The number of Cantor iter-
ations of b before the expansion is deﬁned as the the mth
hierarchical step, with m ∈ {1, 2, ..., n} such that

m = 1: b1

init=(101), the initial base pattern is expanded to
a 1-step hierarchical topology by replacing each el-
ement with 27

m = 2: b2

init=(101000101), the once iterated initial base
pattern is expanded to a 2−step hierarchical topol-
ogy by replacing each element with 27

of itself. This marks the ﬁrst step in the transi-
tion from a nonlocal (m = 1) to a fully hierarchical
(m = n = 3) topology. See Fig. 1(b).

chical topology. See Fig. 1(c).

the following, an m−step hierarchical topology is denoted
as (binit)n, where binit is the underlying base pattern, n
the level of hierarchy and m the hierarchical step in a
transition topology.

B. Clustering coeﬃcients

Besides the bifurcation parameter ε and the coupling
strength σ, the topological quantities binit, c1, n and
the resulting link density ρ = cn
N and fractal dimension
df = ln c1/ ln b are important parameters in the study
of chimera states in hierarchical systems. However, since
there are several distributions of links for a given set of
b and c1 that result in unique topological structures, the
arrangement of links in binit has to be accounted for.
Therefore, we propose to consider the local clustering co-
eﬃcient introduced by Watts and Strogatz80, which, for
a directed graph G=(V, E) containing a set of nodes V
and edges E, describes the number of links in the neigh-
bourhood Ni = {vj : eij ∈ E ∨ eji ∈ E} relative to
the maximum number of links possible. Since a directed
graph distinguishes between eij and eji, the maximum
number of links is given by ki · (ki − 1) and the clustering
coeﬃcient Ci for a node vi is deﬁned as

Ci =

|{ejk : vj, vk ∈ Ni, ejk ∈ E}|

ki(ki − 1)

(3)

Thus, taking up to m = n steps in the hierarchical expan-
sion it is possible to tune a suitable initial base pattern
between a nonlocal and a fully hierarchical topology. In

While common nonlocal coupling schemes can rely on
the coupling range (or variations thereof44) as a deﬁnite
measure, this is not the case in hierarchically coupled

4

base patterns.

These results provide an instructive overview over the
dependence of C upon m. As expected, the clustering co-
eﬃcients decrease across-the-board when introducing hi-
erarchical components. With each step m, the number of
gaps increases disproportionally compared to the number
of links, since each gap in binit introduces b new gaps with
each iteration, while each link only leads to c1 new links
and adds b − c1 further gaps. Thus, the link density de-
creases with each iteration of m and the remaining links
are distributed in a more irregular, hierarchical manner.
A close analysis of C with respect to the underlying base
pattern shows that base patterns with gaps at either the
end or the beginning of binit (such as (011011), Fig. 2,
red dots) result in low clustering coeﬃcients, compared
to systems of equal link density but diﬀerent distribu-
tion (such as (110011), orange squares). Furthermore,
isolated links in binit (such as (100111), yellow squares)
further decrease C(binit, n = m) compared to topologies
constructed from more compact base patterns (such as
(110011), orange squares). However, more compact base
patterns binit that have isolated links (such as (011101),
blue circles) can have larger C(binit, n = m), as compared
to topologies with same number of links but without iso-
lated links (such as (011011), red dots). This can be ex-
plained by the fact that isolated links lead to far-ranging
links rather than coupling to those nodes in their close
neighbourhood. Considering the choice of suitable base
patterns binit for the construction of hierarchical topolo-
gies which exhibit chimeras, it should be noted that base
patterns with larger clustering coeﬃcients are preferable.
Therefore, base patterns should be chosen avoiding iso-
lated links, gaps at the beginning or end, and with com-
pact intervals, if possible. This highlights the basic trade-
oﬀ when studying hierarchical topologies. Compactness
is an important requirement for the existence of chimera
states and at the same time, networks are less compact if
they are more hierarchically structured. If one wants to
study dynamic phenomena and maintain a hierarchical
topology, this has to be balanced in a careful manner,
since low n decreases the actual degree of hierarchy of
the system, while large n produces highly hierarchical
systems (fractal, in the case of n → ∞) but with very
low compactness. It will be shown in the following that
hierarchical topologies resulting from base patterns that
contain only isolated links for given b and c1 have the
lowest clustering coeﬃcient and hence the smallest prob-
ability of exhibiting chimera states.

III. CHIMERA STATES IN HIERARCHICAL
TOPOLOGIES

The simplest illustrative example of a hierarchical
topology is constructed from the base pattern (101). We
consider this pattern in order to demonstrate the step-
by-step transition from nonlocal to hierarchical network
topology with n = 6. At the initial step m = 1, the sys-

FIG. 2. Clustering coeﬃcients C for networks with topologies
varied stepwise from nonlocal to hierarchical for diﬀerent base
patterns (see legend). The hierarchical step m ∈ {1, ..., n = 4}
is used to tune between nonlocal coupling and fully hierar-
chical coupling. At higher hierarchical step m the cluster-
ing coeﬃcients decreases due to the disproportional increase
of gaps versus links in the base pattern. Non-compact base
patterns lead to vanishing clustering coeﬃcients C. This sup-
presses chimera states in hierarchical networks generated from
these base patterns. System sizes (n=4): N = 82 for b = 3,
N = 1297 for b = 6, N = 2402 for b = 7.

networks. Diﬀerent arrangement of links change the com-
pactness of the base pattern and the ﬁnal compactness
of the system strongly depends on the distribution prop-
erties of the c1 links in a base pattern binit. The cluster-
ing coeﬃcient is such a suitable measure since it directly
expresses the compactness of links in the ﬁnal system.
In the following C(binit, n, m) denotes the clustering co-
eﬃcient of an m−step hierarchical topology with base
pattern binit.
In the transition scenario from nonlocal
to hierarchical topologies, the system size and the sym-
metry properties stay the same throughout. However,
each hierarchical step modiﬁes the compactness and to-
tal number of links of the ﬁnal topology which changes
the clustering coeﬃcient C as well as the link density ρ.
Since hierarchical coupling introduces irregular and long-
ranging links and gaps, the clustering coeﬃcient will de-
crease when transiting towards a hierarchical topology.
Out of all the 2b possible base patterns for a given length
b, only a fraction is relevant for discussion in the context
of hierarchical networks. For example, mirror symmet-
ric base patterns (such as (110101) and (101011)) result
in topologies with identical clustering coeﬃcients, while
patterns containing only one link would result in a net-
work with only a single link to each node. In the case
of b = 6, out of 64 possible patterns, only 31 will yield
unique hierarchical topologies. Fig. 2 demonstrates clus-
tering coeﬃcients C(binit, n, m) as a function of the hi-
erarchical step m for a selected number of representative

tem is a nonlocally coupled ring with N = 730 and cou-
pling radius r = 243
730 = 0.333. The clustering coeﬃcient
for this topology is C(101, 6, 1) = 0.748451. This system
has been studied in23, where is was shown that depending
on the coupling radius and strength, chimera states with
diﬀerent numbers of incoherent domains can be observed.
Indeed, Fig. 3(a) shows a 2−chimera state. Snapshots of
the variable uk (upper panels) demonstrate a clear dis-
tinction between coherent and incoherent domains, snap-
shots in the phase space (uk, vk) (bottom panels) show
that the oscillators are scattered around the limit cy-
cle of the uncoupled element which is shown in black.
The middle panels demonstrate the mean phase veloc-
ities for each oscillator calculated as ωk = 2πMk/∆T,
k = 1, ..., N , where Mk is the number of complete ro-
tations around the origin performed by the k−th node
during the time interval ∆T . Throughout the paper, we
use ∆T = 50000, which corresponds to several thousand
periods. Mean phase velocity proﬁles are widely used
as a criterion to distinguish chimera states: constant ωk
corresponds to coherent domains, where neighbouring el-
ements are phase-locked. Arc-like parts of the proﬁles
correspond to incoherent domains.
Usually, chimera states with diﬀerent numbers of incoher-
ent domains exhibit high multistability23, and the choice
of initial condition is crucial. That is why we use spe-
cially prepared chimera-like initial conditions, as in23,
Fig. 1(b).

The 2−step hierarchical network (Fig. 3(b)) is charac-
terized by a smaller clustering coeﬃcient C(101, 6, 2) =
0.557279, and we observe an 8−chimera state. This fact
can be explained by drawing the analogy to nonlocally
coupled systems, where a decrease of the coupling radius
(the number of neighbours coupled to each element) re-
sults in an increase of the number of incoherent domains,
i.e., the chimera multiplicity.

Already for the 3−step hierarchical network shown
in Fig. 3(c), the chimera state vanishes and is not ob-
served for any further iterations up to m = n = 6.
This goes along with a decrease of the clustering coef-
ﬁcient to C(101, 6, 3) = 0.408141 and further down to
C(101, 6, 6) = 0 for the fully hierarchical network (see
Fig. 2). Transiting the system from a nonlocal to a hi-
erarchical topology decreases the clustering coeﬃcient as
well as the total number of links to such an extent that
chimera states do not occur after only 3 out of 6 possible
hierarchical steps.

Figure 4 depicts a similar stepwise transition from non-
local to hierarchical coupling for the symmetric base pat-
tern (110011) with n = 4, which has the same fractal
dimension and link density but larger clustering coeﬃ-
cients. The total system size is N = 1297 and the cluster-
ing coeﬃcients are shown in Fig. 2 (orange squares). For
m = 1 we again observe a 2−chimera, like in Fig. 3(a).
At m = 2, the multiplicity of the chimera increases to
a 7−chimera which remains stable for further hierarchi-

cal steps, and is characterized by a more pronounced ωk
proﬁle at the fully hierarchical level m = n = 4.
The importance of the clustering coeﬃcient as a mea-
sure for hierarchical systems with respect to chimera

states is further highlighted by considering several per-
mutations of this base pattern of length b = 6, and
n = 4. We have performed a multitude of scans over wide
ranges in (ε, σ)-space, for various less symmetric base

patterns and varying initial conditions (specially pre-
pared chimera-like as well as random), but none of them
resulted in a chimera state. Among them are topolo-
gies with the same c1 = 4 but diﬀerent link distribu-
tions and lower clustering coeﬃcients, such as (100111)4,
(011101)4, (110101)4, (011110)4 and (110110)4, but also
systems with larger link densities and clustering coeﬃ-
cients (011111)4, (110111)4. Each base pattern at ﬁxed
hierarchical step has a ﬁxed relative coupling radius, i.e.,
ratio between number of links for each element and size
N of the system. Usually, intermediate values of the rel-
ative coupling radius promote chimera states, whereas at
the same time for small and large relative coupling ra-
dius chimeras are rarely observable. The subtle interplay
of symmetry and compactness of the network topology
with the number of links crucially aﬀects the network
dynamics. Moreover, due to multistability, the choice of
initial conditions usually plays an important role. While
it is impossible to draw a deﬁnite conclusion from purely
empirical studies, this strongly suggests that generally
the combination of a symmetric base pattern with large
clustering coeﬃcient promotes the existence of chimera
states in hierarchical topologies.

IV. STABILITY REGIMES OF CHIMERAS IN
HIERARCHICAL NETWORKS

To elaborate the role of the system parameters we con-
struct the maps of stability regimes in the plane of the
nonlinearity paremeter ε of the individial oscillators, and
the coupling strength σ. For this purpose we choose a
system with base pattern (110011) and n = 4, and con-
sider its 3−step and 4−step hierarchical topology. We
start from specially prepared chimera-like initial condi-
tions for a ﬁxed parameter set, and then use the obtained
ﬁnal state as an initial condition for the subsequent set
of parameters, and so forth with a step size ∆ε = 0.02
and ∆σ = 0.02.

Fig. 5(a) depicts the stability regimes for the base pat-
tern b = (110011) with n = 4 in a 3-step hierarchical
topology (N = 1297). For small values of the non-
linearity parameter ε a completely coherent state with
wave-like proﬁle is observed (yellow triangles, and snap-
shot A in Fig. 5(b)). Conversely, for larger ε, when the
limit cycle of each individual oscillator starts to trans-
form from sinusoidal to relaxation oscillations, we observe
completely incoherent states (red circles, and snapshot C
in Fig. 5(b)). Between these two regimes, there is a region
where chimera states emerge (green squares, and snap-
shot B in Fig. 5(b)). Thus the transition from coherence
to incoherence occurs through chimera states. Further-
more, the boundaries between the cohererent regime and
the chimera state as well as between the chimera state
and the completely incoherent regime shift to larger ε
with increasing σ. Eq. (1) shows that an upscaling of
the local parameter ε has to be counterbalanced by the
coupling strength term which is controlled by σ in order

7

to lead to a similar force for each oscillator. Notably, the
boundaries for chimera emergence in the (ε, σ) plane are
approximately given by straight lines. In the right panel
of Figure 5(b) the mean phase velocity proﬁles are shown
for the three selected points A, B, C in the (ε, σ) plane.
The chimera state in B shows chimera dynamics where
the minima of the proﬁle correspond to the coherent re-
gions.

In contrast, Fig. 6(a) shows the same dynamic regimes
in (ε, σ) space for the fully hierarchical system (110011)
with n = 4. The same qualitative shift and increase of
the stable ε range with increasing σ is observed. How-
ever, the overall area of stability signiﬁcantly decreases
for the fully hierarchical system, while the character of
the chimera state (multiplicity and coherent regions) re-
mains unchanged. The system undergoes the same qual-
itative change of its dynamic behavior, a transition from
a completely coherent state (yellow triangles) to a com-
pletely desynchronized state (red circles) via a 7-chimera
(green squares) with increasing ε. The only diﬀerence
between both systems is the decrease in the clustering
coeﬃcient C and the link density ρ with increasing hi-
erarchical step m. This indicates that a high clustering
coeﬃcients and an increased number of links promote the
existence as well as the stability of chimera states in hi-
erarchical topologies. Stable chimera states are diﬃcult
to observe in hierarchical systems that have a very low
clustering coeﬃcient.

In this exemplary system, as discussed in the previous
section, we have observed only chimera states with 7 in-
coherent domains. For systems with nonlocal coupling
topology we have shown recently that an appropriate
choice of the coupling radius determines the multiplic-
ity of the incoherent regions in chimera states, but there
may be multistability between diﬀerent multi-chimera
states23. Therefore, it is possible that with other initial
conditions one can also ﬁnd other multi-chimera states.
It is remarkable that the regime of chimera states
in hierarchical networks (Figs. 5, 6) extends to much
larger values of the coupling strength σ than has been
found for nonlocal coupling23. This indicates that quasi-
fractal connectivities promote chimeras at large coupling
strength where in more compact topologies completely
coherent states prevail.

V. LARGER BASE PATTERN

Changing the size, symmetry and number of links in
the base pattern binit can lead to various completely dif-
ferent hierarchical topologies. This strongly inﬂuences
the resulting clustering coeﬃcient and the link density of
the ﬁnal system. As previous studies of chimera bifur-
cation scenarios23 have shown, a change in the eﬀective
coupling radius of a nonlocal topology leads to diﬀerent
regimes of chimera states with various multiplicities. The
same is true when the link density is increased. Since for
the systems with b = 6, n = 4, c1 = 4 we have only found

chimera states in some symmetric conﬁgurations, we will
now consider larger base patterns. This, consequently,
allows for more links in the base pattern, and generates
networks with higher clustering coeﬃcients in the fully
hierarchical system m = n. However, this dramatically

increases the network size, making numerical simulations
more expensive.

The link density is ρ = g
N = 0.54 which is considerably
larger than for the previously considered examples
with base pattern of length b = 6. Furthermore, the
clustering coeﬃcient of the fully hierarchical network
C(1110111, 4, 4) = 0.548829 is larger than in all previous
examples.

We ﬁx the nonlinearity parameter ε = 0.1, and ob-
serve the system dynamics for three increasing values of
coupling strength σ = 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, starting from ran-
dom initial conditions. Fig. 7 depicts the correspond-
ing snapshots, mean phase velocity proﬁles, and phase
portraits. For small coupling strength (Fig. 7(a)), a
chimera state with high multiplicity (14−chimera) is ob-
tained. With increasing coupling strength we move to-
wards chimera states with two incoherent domains, but
this chimera performs much stronger amplitude dynamics
(bottom panel in Fig. 7(b)). Such two diﬀerent types of
chimera states with strong and weak amplitude dynam-
ics, respectively, were recently observed also in nonlocally
coupled networks of Van der Pol oscillators23. Further
increase of the coupling strength results in a complex 4-
chimera state (Fig. 7(c)). Here, the amplitude dynamics
is even stronger and the coherent regions exhibit an addi-
tional substructure. In hierarchical systems of FitzHugh-
Nagumo oscillators44, nesting eﬀects that appear some-
what similar to the observed structure in the amplitude
have been observed in the mean phase velocity ωk.
In
Fig. 7(c) however, the substructure is observed in the am-
plitude (top panel) and not in the mean phase velocity
proﬁle (middle panel). A closer look at the phase por-
trait (bottom panel) shows strong amplitude dynamics
of a peculiar vortex-like structure, caused by the cluster-
ing of oscillators in the diﬀerent coherent regions. Here,
clusters of coherent nodes oscillate on smaller cycles in
phase space while incoherent nodes roughly follow the
limit cycle of the uncoupled system.

Thus, large hierarchical networks allow us to observe
a variety of chimera states with either weak or strong
amplitude dynamics.

VI. CONCLUSION

In the current study, we have analyzed chimera states
in networks with hierarchical topologies. Using a modi-
ﬁed iterative Cantor construction algorithm, the network
topology is tuned stepwise between nonlocal and hierar-
chical. We have identiﬁed the clustering coeﬃcient and
symmetry properties of the base pattern as crucial fac-
tors in classifying diﬀerent topologies with respect to the
occurrence of chimera states. We show that symmetric
topologies with large clustering coeﬃcients promote the
emergence of chimera states, while they are suppressed
by slight topological asymmetries or small clustering co-
eﬃcients. We have determined stability regimes in the
plane of coupling strength and nonlinearity parameter of
the individual oscillator, which show that chimera states
indeed appear on the transition scenario between com-

9

plete coherence and incoherence. The analysis of an ex-
emplary network with larger base pattern, resulting in
larger clustering coeﬃcient and more complex network
structure, has revealed two diﬀerent types of chimera
states highlighting the increasing role of amplitude dy-
namics.
