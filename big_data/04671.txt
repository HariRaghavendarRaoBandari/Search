Abstract

AGN jets carry helical magnetic ﬁelds, which can aﬀect dark matter if the latter
is axionic. This preliminary study shows that the nature of the axionic condensate
may change and instead of dark matter may behave more like exotic matter, which
violates the null energy condition. If the central supermassive black hole of an active
galaxy is laced with exotic matter then it may become a wormhole. In general, the
presence of exotic matter may aﬀect galaxy formation and galactic dynamics, so this
possibility should not be ignored when considering axionic dark matter.

As supersymmetric particles have not been observed in the LHC yet, interest in axionic
dark matter is increasing. Such dark matter has a loop-suppressed interaction with the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, which opens up observational possibilities that aim to exploit the
photon-axion conversion in astrophysical magnetic ﬁelds. Many authors have considered
the electromagnetic interaction of axion particles [1]. However, the eﬀect of this interaction
to the axionic condensate itself has been largely ignored, assuming that it is negligible. In
this paper we investigate the eﬀect of an helical magnetic ﬁeld on an axionic condensate. We
ﬁnd that, if the magnetic ﬁeld is strong enough, axionic dark matter is modiﬁed into exotic
matter. Then we apply our ﬁndings to the helical magnetic ﬁelds in the jets of Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We ﬁnd that the magnetic ﬁelds near the central supermassive
black hole may be strong enough to lead to the formation of exotic matter, that may give
rise to a wormhole and aﬀect galaxy formation and dynamics. We use natural units, for
which c = ¯h = 1, with mP = 2.4 × 1018 GeV being the reduced Planck mass m2
P = 8πG.
For the signature of the metric we take (+1,−1,−1,−1).
The axion (or an axion like particle) ﬁeld φ, at tree level has a coupling to a fermionic
ﬁeld ψ of the form φ ¯ψψ. Therefore, the axion couples to the photon via a fermionic loop as

Lφγ = −

where Fµν is the Faraday tensor, ˜F µν = ǫµνρσFρσ is its dual and E and B are the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld respectively. In the above we have deﬁned the dimensionful coupling
gφγ = α N /2πfa, where the fa is the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scale, while α ≃ 1/137. We will
assume N = 1. The Lagrangian density for the axion is

(3)

where m is the axion mass. If inﬂation occurred after the PQ transition, the axion ﬁeld
is homogenised. For a homogeneous axion in an expanding Universe, the Klein-Gordon
equation of motion is

¨φ + 3H ˙φ + V ′(φ) = gφγ E · B ,

(4)

where H(t) is the Hubble parameter, the dot denotes derivative with respect to the cos-
mic time and the prime denotes derivative with respect to φ. In the early Universe the
electromagnetic source term in the above may be neglected. The variation of the axion is
overdamped and the axion remains constant until H 2 ∼ V ′′, when the axion unfreezes and
begins undergoing coherent oscillations [2]. Very soon after the onset of the oscillations
φ ≪ fa and the potential becomes quadratic V ≃ 1
2m2φ2. Soon the period of oscillations
becomes exponentially smaller than the Hubble time, so that the expansion of the Universe
can be ignored for timescales shorter than H −1. Then, Eq. (4) becomes ¨φ + m2φ ≃ 0 with
solution
(5)

φ = Φ cos(mt + β) ,

with Φ being the oscillation amplitude and β being an initial constant phase. Over cos-
mological timescales the Hubble friction term in Eq. (4) cannot be neglected, so that
Φ = Φ(t). A homogeneous scalar ﬁeld oscillating coherently with a quadratic potential can
be regarded as pressureless matter whose density scales as [2]

(6)

where the star denotes the onset of the ﬁeld oscillations, we have assumed that Φ∗ ∼ fa , the
scale factor is a ∝ 1/T and the temperature at the onset of the oscillations is T∗ ∼ √m mP .
We have also assumed that m remains constant.

Now, suppose that the electromagnetic source term in Eq. (4) cannot be neglected. In
this case, the oscillating axion may have a spatial dependence as well, due to the helical
magnetic ﬁeld. Considering timescales much smaller than the Hubble time and assuming
Minkowski spacetime for the moment, the equation of motion becomes

¨φ − ∇2φ + m2φ = gφγ E · B .

(7)

2

Let us consider that the electromagnetic source term has no time dependence. Then, the
solution to the above is of the form

where ˙Q = 0. Putting this in Eq. (7) we have

φ = Φ cos(mt + β) + Q ,

(m2 − ∇2)Q = gφγ E · B .

(8)

(9)

Now, let’s assume that the characteristic size of the helical magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is
much larger than the axion Compton wavelength. In this case ∇2Q ≪ m2Q, so we ﬁnd

Q ≃ gφγ
For the energy-momentum tensor we have

Tµν = 2

∂gµν − gµνL = ∂µφ∂νφ − gµνL ,

(10)

(11)

where L is given in Eq (2). Thus, we ﬁnd for the energy density of the axion condensate

ρφ = T00 =

The pressure corresponds to the spatial components of Tµν. The oﬀ diagonal spatial com-
ponents are simply Tij = ∂iφ ∂jφ, where i, j = 1, 2, 3 and i 6= j. The diagonal components
(the principal pressures) are Tii = (∂iφ)2 + pφ with

pφ = −L =

(13)

The spatial gradients of the axion conﬁguration mirror the spatial gradients of the magnetic
ﬁeld. If the latter are much larger than the axion Compton wavelength then, on average,
|∂iφ| ≪ m|φ|. This means that the oﬀ diagonal components of Tµν become negligible and
the principal pressures all become approximately equal pφ in Eq. (13). We insert Eq. (8)
in the above to ﬁnd

ρφ ≃

(14)

where for the pressure we have considered the average value over many oscillations such that
sin2 ω = cos2 ω = 1
2 with ω = mt + β and we considered a magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration with
typical scale larger than m−1 so that (∇Q)2 ≪ (m Q)2. It is evident that, in the absence
of a magnetic ﬁeld, we have ¯pφ = 0 so the axionic condensate behaves as dark matter with
ρφ = 1
2m2Φ2. However, we will assume that a helical magnetic ﬁeld is present. Therefore,

if Q2 > Φ2)
We see that, if the electromagnetic contribution in Eq. (8) is dominant (i.e.
then ρφ + ¯pφ < 0 and the condensate is no more behaving like dark matter but more like
exotic matter, which violates the null energy condition. Therefore, the conditions necessary
for turning axionic dark matter into exotic matter are

(∇Q)2 ≪ (m Q)2

and Q2 > Φ2,

(16)

where Q is determined by the helical magnetic ﬁeld as shown in Eq. (10). 1

It so happens that the conditions in Eq. (16) may be satisﬁed in AGN jets. Observations
suggest that AGN jets feature powerful helical magnetic ﬁelds [3]. Most spiral galaxies are
assumed to go through the AGN phase when their central supermassive black hole is
formed. The AGN jet can be huge in length (up to Mpc scales). Its spine, however, is
narrow; typically d ∼ (10−4 − 50) pc, which, however, is typically larger than the axion
Compton wavelength m−1. Thus, (∇Q)2 ≪ (m Q)2 is satisﬁed. Now, the AGN spine is
electromagnetically dominated, so that Q2 > Φ2 seems reasonable. Let us estimate this.
The helicity of the magnetic ﬁeld along the AGN jet is thought to be due to the rotation
of the accretion disk [4]. It can be modelled as a longitudinal (poloidal) ﬁeld Bk and a
transverse (toroidal) ﬁeld B⊥, which is a Biot-Savart ﬁeld due to the current along the
jet, such that J = ∇× B⊥, where J = σ E is the current and σ is the plasma conductivity.
Thus, from Eq. (10) we have

Q =

where η = 1/σ is the plasma resistivity. The above needs to be compared with Φ, which
at present is given by Eq. (6) evaluated today

(18)

where TCMB ∼ 0.1 meV is the temperature of the CMB. Φ0 is the average value of Φ
today. Since, the present density of dark matter is ρDM0 ≃ 0.3ρ0 ∼ 10−30 g/cm3 and
ρDM0 = 1

2 (mΦ0)2, we ﬁnd Φ0 ∼ 10−24 GeV2/m. Combining this with Eq. (18) we obtain

m ∼ 10−3  1012 GeV

(19)

However, inside galaxies, the dark matter density is expected to be much larger. Indeed,
a typical estimate for dark matter in the vicinity of the Earth is ρDME ≃ 0.3 GeV/cm3,
which is about 105ρDM0. Depending on the dark matter halo model, the density of dark
matter can be ∼ 50 times bigger in the core. Because ρDM ∝ Φ2 this means that the core
value of Φ can be ΦC ∼ 103Φ0.

1Note that, when Q2 > Φ2 the density in Eq. (14) becomes negative. However, the magnetic ﬁeld also

contributes into the energy density ρB = B 2/8π > 0, which overwhelms ρφ.

The onset of the jet is near the event horizon. To ignore relativistic corrections, we
choose R ∼ 103 rS for the onset of the jet, where rS = 2GMBH is the Scwarzschild radius
for which rS ∼ 10−4(cid:16) MBH
109M⊙(cid:17)pc . Supermassive black holes typically have MBH <
∼ 109M⊙,
which means that rS <
∼ 10−4 pc. Thus, we take R ∼ 0.1 pc for the onset of the jet. Now,
ﬂux conservation suggests that B⊥ ∝ 1/r and Bk ∝ 1/r2, where r denotes the distance
from the central supermassive black hole [4, 5]. Therefore,

(B⊥Bk)core

0.1 pc!3
(B⊥Bk)lobe ∼  1 Mpc

= 1021,

(21)

where we assumed that the jet is about 1 Mpc long. The minimum magnetic ﬁeld at
the lobes is of equipartition value ∼ µG [4]. So, (B⊥Bk)lobe ∼ 10−12 G2. Note that
(B⊥Bk)core ∼ 109 G2 nicely agrees with the fact that magnetic ﬁelds of about 104 G are
expected in the accretion disk. Therefore,

ΦC ∼ (η/d) × 10−12

The resistivity of the plasma is still an open issue, although it is implicitly estimated
in MHD simulations. This is because the plasma in jets is far from thermal equilibrium,
while it is still uncertain which particles are the primary charge carriers for the current.
An estimate, based on numerical investigation, is provided by [6]

near the core is d ∼ R ∼ 0.1 pc, we have

ΦC ∼ 10−13

(24)

Thus, we see that the axionic condensate can become exotic matter near the AGN core if
fa >
∼ 1016 GeV, which is quite plausible. From Eq. (19) we ﬁnd that m−1 ∼ 10−4 pc≪ d
for fa ∼ 1016 GeV, which means that the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration is safely much larger
than the axionic Compton wavelength.
In general, we expect to be in Kerr spacetime. Now, the jets are projected along the

directions of the poles, which implies that sin θ ≃ 0. Then, the Kerr metric reduces to

where ∆
, with a = GJ/M; J being the angular momentum. Assuming
that the black hole is not extremal means a < rS. Thus, taking d ∼ R ∼ 103 rS ensures
that relativistic corrections are small.
It is known that stable and traversible wormholes require spacetime to be ﬁlled with
exotic matter, which violates the null energy condition [7]. As shown, axionic dark matter
can be transformed into exotic matter near the cores of the AGNs due to the helical
magnetic ﬁelds of the jets. The combination of exotic matter with a magnetic ﬁeld can
also give rise to a wormhole [9]. Is it possible to render the supermassive black holes in
the centres of active galaxies into stable (and possibly traversible) wormholes? As Wheeler
famously said, “matter tells spacetime how to curve”. Thus, the presence of exotic matter
may force the appearance of wormholes in the AGN centres.

A macroscopic wormhole requires a change in the topology of spacetime, which might
be forbidden. On the other hand, one can envisage the quantum nucleation of microscopic
so-called Wheeler wormholes from spacetime foam [8], near the singularity of the supermas-
sive black hole. Rendering the AGN black holes into wormholes (the Kerr geometry may
help in this [8]) will have profound implications for galaxy formation (e.g. traversible worm-
holes may emit as well absorb matter) and galactic dynamics (e.g. rotation curves [10]).
Similar implications arise just from the transformation of the dark matter into exotic mat-
ter with negative density even if a wormhole does not form, because negative density is
gravitationally repulsive. Our study is not thorough enough to provide deﬁnite answers to
these questions, but demonstrates that the issue warrants deeper investigation. It is likely
that relativistic corrections as well as considering that the axion mass may change in the
Early Universe might improve the result.

As a corollary, if dark matter is axionic, one can imagine that an advanced civilisation
may generate artiﬁcially a helical magnetic ﬁeld, with the appropriate characteristics to
alter the nature of the local dark matter into exotic matter, and maybe to give rise to a
wormhole. This might become a way to realise interstellar travel (and/or time travel [11]).
