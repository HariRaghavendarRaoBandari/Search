A method is proposed for the inclusion of electron correlation in the calculation of the tempera-
ture dependence of band structures arising from electron-phonon coupling. It relies on an eﬃcient
exploration of the vibrational phase space along the recently introduced thermal lines. Using the
G0W0 approximation, the temperature dependence of the direct gaps of diamond, silicon, lithium
ﬂuoride, magnesium oxide, and titanium dioxide is calculated. Within the proposed formalism, a
single calculation at each temperature of interest is suﬃcient to obtain results of the same accu-
racy as in alternative, more expensive methods. It is shown that many-body contributions beyond
semi-local density functional theory modify the electron-phonon coupling strength by almost 50%
in diamond, silicon, and titanium dioxide, but by less than 5% in lithium ﬂouride and magnesium
oxide. The results reveal a complex picture regarding the validity of semi-local functionals for the
description of electron-phonon coupling.

The coupling of electrons and atomic vibrations in
solids underlies many phenomena,
such as phonon-
mediated superconductivity1,2,
the temperature de-
pendence of band structures3, electronic transport4–6,
or phonon-assisted optical absorption7–9. Almost all
ﬁrst principles calculations of electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) rely on semi-local density functional theory
(DFT)10–20. However, recent studies have shown that
many-body eﬀects are required to accurately capture the
EPC strength in carbon-based materials 4,21–25, and in
some families of superconductors26–28. Given the ubiq-
uity of EPC in condensed matter, it is of primary im-
portance to determine whether the much-used semi-local
DFT only fails in the above-mentioned examples, or
whether it is also insuﬃcient in a wider context.

The intrinsic computational expense of many-body
methods makes EPC calculations prohibitive in many
cases. Linear response methods29, which are computa-
tionally advantageous, are not yet available in the context
of many-body perturbation theory. Instead, the existing
EPC studies beyond semi-local DFT rely on the frozen-
phonon approach, which is computationally expensive.
In a ﬁrst attempt to reduce the computational cost of
these calculations, Faber and co-workers30 have explored
approximations to the GW self-energy ionic gradients
needed for a perturbative calculation of EPC eﬀects,
demonstrating that the constant screening approach (us-
ing the screened Coulomb potential of the static lattice
for the distorted structures) is a viable alternative to ob-
tain relatively accurate results in carbon-based materials.

In this paper, I present an accurate and computation-
ally inexpensive method to include many-body eﬀects in
the calculation of the temperature dependence of band
structures, one of the signatures of EPC. The prediction
of accurate band gaps and their temperature dependence
is central in ﬁelds ranging from photovoltaics31 to topo-

logical insulators32–34. The proposed method relies on
the exploration of the vibrational phase space along the
recently introduced thermal lines35, and accurate results
are obtained with a single many-body calculation at each
temperature of interest.

As a ﬁrst application of the method, the G0W0 approx-
imation is used to calculate the temperature dependence
of the direct gaps of diamond (C), silicon (Si), lithium
ﬂuoride (LiF), magnesium oxide (MgO), and rutile tita-
nium dioxide (TiO2). The many-body contributions to
the strength of EPC beyond semi-local DFT are found to
be about 50% in C, Si, and TiO2, but below 5% in LiF
and MgO. These results reveal a complex interplay be-
tween electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling.

The vibrations in a solid formed by N atoms can be
described by the 3(N − 1) harmonic normal coordinates
{qνk}, where k represents a vibrational Brillouin zone
(BZ) point, and ν a branch index. General conﬁgurations
of the atoms in the solid are described by the vector q, a
3(N − 1)-dimensional vector containing the amplitude of
each normal coordinate. The electronic band gap Eg(q)
is a function of the atomic positions, and its adiabatic
harmonic vibrational average at temperature T is

methods involve the evaluation of the band gap at multi-
ple atomic conﬁgurations q, of the order of 100 to 1000,
and their use in conjunction with computationally inten-
sive many-body techniques is therefore very limited.

Motivated by the mean value theorem for integrals, a
simpler method to evaluate Eq. (1) can be found follow-
ing Ref. 35 to deﬁne a set of 23(N−1) thermal lines TS(T )
in conﬁguration space, parametrized by the temperature
T , for which atomic positions are given by:

(cid:19)1/2

(cid:18) 1

[1 + 2nB(ωνk, T )]

,

(2)

where nB(ω, T ) = (eω/kBT − 1)−1 is a Bose-Einstein fac-
tor. Thermal lines TS are labelled by the 3(N − 1)-
dimensional vector S that contains the sign of each degree
of freedom in Eq. (2). Thermal lines have the property
that the value of a physical quantity at position T is ap-
proximately equal to the value of the vibrational average
of that quantity at temperature T . For example, the
value of (cid:104)Eg(T )(cid:105) is approximately equal to the value of
Eg[TS(T )] for an atomic conﬁguration at position T on
any thermal line TS. The value of a property at point
T = 0 is approximately equal to the quantum average of
that property, and points T = 0 are referred to as quan-
tum points. For more details about thermal lines, see
Ref. 35.

Thermal lines can be used to eﬃciently explore the vi-
brational phase space to calculate quantum and thermal
averages35. Here, a mean thermal line is deﬁned such
that the corresponding atomic conﬁguration has a value
of the band gap equal to the vibrational average, and thus
a single many-body calculation on the mean thermal line
is suﬃcient to obtain accurate vibrational averages.

The calculations described in this paper have been per-
formed using both semi-local DFT and the many-body
G0W0 approximation. The DFT calculations have been
performed using the plane-wave quantum espresso
package39. The DFT results provide the starting Kohn-
Sham states used in the many-body calculations per-
formed with the plane-wave Yambo code40. The numer-
ical parameters of the calculations are described in the
Supplemental Material41, and they lead to static lattice
direct gaps as shown in Table I, in agreement with lit-
erature values42,43. The lattice parameters of the diﬀer-
ent structures are also shown in Table I. The vibrational
eigenmodes have been obtained using the ﬁnite displace-
ment method44.

The methodology is initially described using C as a
test system, as previous calculations using alternative
methods exist for comparison, and the results for the
other materials are presented later. A set of 100 ther-
mal lines is randomly chosen for C, and their quantum
points (T = 0) are used in the following. For each of the
100 corresponding atomic conﬁgurations, the optical gap
Eg[TS(0)] is calculated using the local density approxi-
mation of density functional theory (LDA-DFT) and the
G0W0 approximation. Figure S1 shows the band gap

zero-point (ZP) correction ∆Eg = Eg[TS(0)] − Eg(0) for
each of the 100 conﬁgurations, comparing the G0W0 ZP
correction (vertical axis) against the LDA-DFT ZP cor-
rection (horizontal axis). The central feature of Fig. S1
is the strong linear correlation between the band gap
corrections evaluated with either method. Most studies
assume that many-body eﬀects on electron-phonon cou-
pling are negligible, and such scenario, which is shown
to hold for LiF and MgO below, would lead to a lin-
ear correlation with a slope of one and zero oﬀset. The
present work shows that, for some materials, including
C in Fig. S1, the above scenario breaks down and many-
body eﬀects make an important contribution to EPC.
The results depicted in Fig. S1 correspond to a 54-atom
simulation cell, but similar correlations are observed at
other cell sizes.

The linear correlation between the G0W0 and the
LDA-DFT corrections suggests a simple scheme:
(i)
choose an appropriate thermal line at the DFT level, and
(ii) use this single thermal line to explore conﬁguration
space using many-body calculations. Thus, n thermal
lines are sampled at the DFT level at small computa-
tional cost, and then the mean thermal line TS is selected

calculation, and the red circles to the G0W0 calculation. The
dotted-dashed and dashed black lines are theoretical results
from Ref. 25, and the black triangles are experimental results

the band gap has been taken from Ref. 25 to be 7.732 eV.

over thermal lines. Errors below 3% are achieved using
as few as 10 thermal lines to determine the mean ther-
mal line. The residual error of 1% arises from the ﬁnite
spread of the points in Fig. S1, and is similar to the size
of the RMS.
For the full data set (n = 100), the G0W0 ZP band
gap correction is −508 meV using the mean thermal line,
and the average over 100 thermal lines is −503 meV
(1% error). To put this error in context, in C there is
a 50 meV uncertainty (12% error) associated with the
choice of pseudopotential14, and up to a 40 meV uncer-
tainty (9% error) associated with the use of a quadratic
or a Monte Carlo method to evaluate Eq. (1)35. There-
fore, using the mean thermal line TS appears to be a
promising approach to routinely and accurately calculate
the temperature dependence of band structures including
many-body eﬀects.

The ﬁnal results for C are presented in Fig. 3 for a
larger simulation cell containing 128 atoms. The calcu-
lations have been performed by randomly sampling 100
thermal lines using LDA-DFT, then selecting the mean
thermal line TS according to Eq. (3), and performing a
single many-body G0W0 calculation at each temperature
of interest along the mean thermal line. The results in
Fig. 3 are in good agreement with previous theoretical
calculations25 (black lines), and with available experi-
mental data (black triangles)45.

This procedure can be iterated to deﬁne ith order mean
thermal lines, which could be used to increase the accu-
racy at small additional computational cost, as demon-
strated for TiO2 below. In Eq. (3) the quantum point
T = 0 is used to select the mean thermal line, but simi-
lar results are obtained at other temperatures, as thermal
lines at diﬀerent temperatures are correlated35. As semi-
local DFT calculations are computationally inexpensive
compared to many-body calculations, a thermal line can
be deﬁned at each temperature of interest with a new
semi-local DFT sampling. This approach has been used
below for TiO2.

To test the methodology, the G0W0 ZP correction to
the optical gap of C is evaluated using the data for the
(cid:80)n
54-atom simulation cells used in Fig. S1. First, the G0W0
ZP correction is calculated by averaging over n thermal
lines, (cid:104)Eg(0)(cid:105)n = 1
i=1 Eg[TSi(0)], as in Ref. 35. Sec-
ond, the same ZP correction is evaluated by selecting
the mean thermal line from n LDA-DFT data points ac-
cording to Eq. (3), and evaluating the G0W0 ZP correc-
tion only for the conﬁguration corresponding to the mean
thermal line, Eg[TSn
(0)]. The results are summarized in
Fig. 2. For a given number n of thermal lines (horizontal
axis), Fig. 2 shows Eg[TSn
(0)] − (cid:104)Eg(0)(cid:105)n, the diﬀerence
between the G0W0 ZP correction calculated using only
the mean thermal line and that calculated by averaging

method25, 62 GW calculations are required46. For a
4 × 4 × 4 BZ sampling grid, an equivalent supercell con-
tains 128 atoms, and should naively require 3×(128−1) =
381 sampling points. However, exploiting the symmetries
of the diamond structure, this number can be reduced
to 62 sampling points. The method presented in this
work requires an order of magnitude fewer calculations
than the quadratic method. The reduction in computa-
tional cost is smaller, as in the quadratic method not all
points in the BZ grid require the same supercell size. A
point (m1/n1, m2/n2, m3/n3) (in fractional coordinates)
can be accessed with supercells of size n1n2n3 using the
standard supercell approach, or smaller supercells of size
equal to the least common multiple of n1, n2, and n3,
using non-diagonal supercells47.

Linear correlations between the DFT and G0W0 ZP
corrections to the gap are also observed in Si, LiF, MgO,
and TiO2 (see Supplemental Material41). The method
proposed here relies on this correlation, for which there
is no general proof. However, it has also been reported
in molecular crystals between semi-local DFT and hybrid
functional DFT20, suggesting that mean thermal lines for
the inclusion of many-body eﬀects will be applicable in a
wide variety of materials.

In Fig. 4, the ZP correction and temperature depen-
dence of the direct gaps of these four materials are re-
ported. The calculations have been performed using the
mean thermal line, selected from 100 DFT thermal lines,
and with simulation cells containing 128 atoms for Si,
LiF, and MgO, and 108 atoms for TiO2. For TiO2, the
DFT ZP corrections have a wide range of values, and the
accuracy of the results is signiﬁcantly improved by using
higher order mean thermal lines.

For Si, the inset in Fig. 4 shows a comparison with the
experimental temperature dependence48, where the zero-
temperature band gap has been taken as a reference. As
in diamond, the agreement with experiment improves sig-
niﬁcantly with the inclusion of electron correlation, and
the remaining diﬀerence could be attributed to ﬁnite-size
eﬀects49. For LiF and MgO, the inclusion of correla-
tion eﬀects decreases the band gap correction slightly. In
TiO2, the temperature dependence of the band gap is
nonmonotonic, with low energy phonons excited at low
temperatures opening the gap, and harder, higher energy
phonons closing the gap, with a cross-over between the
two regimes at about 400 K using DFT, and 600 K using
G0W0. This diﬀerence provides a good test of the theory
by experiment.
In TiO2, even though the ZP correc-
tion to the gap is very similar between DFT and G0W0,
the distinct temperature dependences demonstrate that
correlation signiﬁcantly aﬀects electron-phonon coupling
in this material. Finally, it should be noted that exci-
tonic eﬀects50 are important in the optical properties of
some materials, and that in polar compounds, GW band
gaps can be modiﬁed by long-range electric ﬁelds51 and
electron-phonon coupling strength is also aﬀected52,53.
The inclusion of these eﬀects is beyond the scope of the

present work. Lattice thermal expansion also modiﬁes
band gaps, as discussed in the Supplemental Material41.

In conclusion, I have introduced an accurate and com-
putationally inexpensive method to evaluate the eﬀects of
electron-phonon coupling on band structures using many-
body techniques along thermal lines. Although the re-
sults presented here have been obtained using the one
shot G0W0 approximation, the same methodology should
be applicable to other many-body techniques, such as
self-consistent GW , or to wave function methods such as
quantum Monte Carlo. The temperature dependence of
the band gaps of diamond, silicon, lithium ﬂuoride, mag-
nesium oxide, and titanium dioxide, has been calculated

using the G0W0 approximation. Many-body contribu-
tions range from 5 to 50% in these materials, suggest-
ing a complex interplay between electron-electron and
electron-phonon coupling.

I. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

The calculations of the temperature dependence of the band gaps of C, Si, LiF, MgO, and TiO2 have been performed

using both semi-local DFT and the many-body G0W0 approximation.

The DFT calculations have been performed using the plane-wave quantum espresso packageS39, with the local
density approximation (LDA)S54,S55 for C and Si, and the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof (PBE)S56 for LiF, MgO, and TiO2. Electronic Brillouin zone (BZ) grids of size 16 × 16 × 16 centred at
Γ were used for the primitive 2-atom cells of C, Si, LiF, and MgO, and a grid size of 10 × 10 × 12 for the 6-atom
TiO2 primitive cell. Commensurate grids have been used for the supercell calculations. Plane-wave energy cut-oﬀs
of 50 Ha, 40 Ha, 250 Ha, 200 Ha, and 200 Ha have been chosen for C, Si, LiF, MgO, and TiO2, respectively. Scalar
relativistic norm-conserving Troullier-Martins pseudopotentialsS57 from the quantum espresso library are used for
all elements, with the inclusion of semi-core states for Ti. For comparison, a calculation using a 54-atom simulation
cell yields a LDA-DFT zero-point (ZP) correction to the direct gap of diamond of −373 meV, in good agreement
with the −381 meV correction obtained for the same structure using Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotentialsS58 and the
castep codeS59 (diﬀerences of up to 50 meV due to the choice of pseudopotential have been reported for diamondS14).
The DFT results provide the starting Kohn-Sham states used in the many-body calculations performed with the
plane-wave Yambo codeS40. The G0W0 calculations have been performed within the plasmon-pole approximationS60,
with cutoﬀs of 7 Ha (C, MgO, and TiO2), 4 Ha (Si), and 9 Ha (LiF) for the dielectric function, and including a
number of bands appropriate to obtain converged results at each system size. The resulting static lattice direct gaps
of 7.49 eV, 3.32 eV, 12.98 eV, 6.61 eV, and 3.26 eV for C, Si, LiF, MgO, and TiO2, respectively, are in agreement with
literature valuesS42,S43. Less stringent convergence criteria can be used for the evaluation of the energy diﬀerences
required for the calculation of band gap corrections.

The structures and vibrational eigenmodes used in the present work are the same as those in Ref.S35 for C and
Si, with lattice parameters of 3.532 ˚A and 5.394 ˚A respectively. For LiF, the relaxed structure within PBE has a
lattice parameter of 4.068 ˚A, for MgO of 4.251 ˚A, and for TiO2, a structure with lattice parameters a = 4.587 ˚A and
c = 2.949 ˚A was used instead of the PBE relaxed structure, as the latter leads to imaginary phonons. The vibrational
eigenmodes have been obtained using the ﬁnite displacement methodS44.

II. RELATION BETWEEN DFT AND G0W0 FOR SI, LIF, MGO, AND TIO2

Figure S1 shows the G0W0 band gap ZP correction as a function of the DFT band gap ZP correction for Si, LiF,

MgO, and TiO2. A strong correlation is observed with correlation coeﬃcients above 0.96 in all cases.

III. THERMAL EXPANSION

Thermal expansion aﬀects the size of the direct gap of materials.

It is a separate eﬀect to the change induced
by electron-phonon coupling, and the conclusions of the main manuscript regarding the validity of semi-local DFT
compared to many-body perturbation theory are independent of it. Nonetheless, it is interesting to estimate its size.
In diamond, the gap decreases by 16 meV when temperature increases from 0 K to 1000 KS12. This change is over

an order of magnitude smaller than the change caused by electron-phonon coupling in this temperature range.

For the rest of materials, the eﬀects of thermal expansion on the gap are estimated by considering experimental
volumes as a function of temperature. Silicon has a nonmonotonic thermal expansion behaviour, exhibiting ther-
mal contraction at temperatures below about 110 KS61, and at 300 K the lattice constant has increased by about
0.002 ˚A from zero temperatureS62. As a result, thermal expansion closes the band gap in Si by 0.5 meV at 300 K, a
negligible eﬀect as in the case of diamond.

The gap closure induced by thermal expansion is signiﬁcantly larger in the other materials. In LiF, the lattice
parameter increases by 0.07 ˚A at 700 KS63, driving a gap clousure of 416 meV. In MgO, the lattice parameter
increases by 0.03 ˚A at 700 KS64, accompanied by a gap closure of 192 meV. In TiO2, the a lattice parameter increases
by 0.02 ˚A, and the c lattice parameter by 0.04 ˚A at 700 KS65, while the band gap decreases by 63 meV.
