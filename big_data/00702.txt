Abstract

We study the monodromies and the limit mixed Hodge structures of families
of complete intersection varieties over a punctured disk in the complex plane. For
this purpose, we express their motivic nearby ﬁbers in terms of the geometric data
of some Newton polyhedra.
In particular, the limit mixed Hodge numbers and
some part of the Jordan normal forms of the monodromies of such a family will be
described very explicitly.

Introduction

Families of algebraic varieties are basic objects in algebraic geometry. Here we are in-
terested in the special but fundamental case where such one Y is smooth and deﬁned
over the punctured disk B(0; ε)∗ = {t ∈ C | 0 < |t| < ε} ⊂ C (0 < ε ≪ 1) in C. For
this family πY : Y −→ B(0; ε)∗ let us consider its ﬁbers Yt = π−1
Y (t) ⊂ Y (0 < |t| < ε)
and their cohomology groups H j(Yt; C) (j ∈ Z). Then it is our primary interest to know
H j(Yt; C) themselves and the monodromy operators acting on them. Moreover, in addi-
tion to the classical mixed Hodge structure of Deligne, each cohomology group H j(Yt; C)
is endowed with the limit mixed Hodge structure which encodes some information of the
monodromy (see El Zein [9] and Steenbrink-Zucker [36] etc.). However in general, it is
very hard to compute the monodromies and the limit mixed Hodge numbers explicitly.
Very recently, based on our previous works [10], [21], [22] and some new results in [16],
[17], Stapledon [34] succeeded in computing the latter ones for families Y ⊂ B(0; ε)∗ × Cn
of sch¨on hypersurfaces in Cn. Here the sch¨onness is a very weak condition which is al-
most always satisﬁed. More precisely, in [34] the author expressed the motivic nearby
ﬁber ψt([Y ]) of such Y −→ B(0; ε) = {t ∈ C | |t| < ε} = B(0; ε)∗ ⊔ {0} by the function
t = idC : C −→ C in terms of the tropical variety associated to the deﬁning Laurent
polynomial f (t, x) ∈ C(t)[x1, . . . , xn] of the hypersurface Y ⊂ B(0; ε)∗ × Cn and obtained
a complete description of the limit mixed Hodge numbers of H j(Yt; C) (0 < |t| < ε). His
idea is to subdivide Cn into some algebraic tori (C∗)k (0 ≤ k ≤ n) by the additivity of
in
ψt and apply the arguments of Batyrev-Borisov [1] and Borisov-Mavlyutov [2] etc.

mirror symmetry to each piece (C∗)k by using the new special polynomials introduced
in Katz-Stapledon [16]. In particular, he eﬀectively used the purity and the generalized
Poincar´e duality for the intersection cohomology groups of some singular hypersurfaces
in the toric compactiﬁcations of (C∗)k to obtain these remarkable results. Thanks to
them, the ﬁrst author T. Saito obtained some new results on the weight ﬁltrations of
the stalks of intersection cohomology complexes. See [31] for the details. However the
motivic nearby ﬁber ψt([Y ]) used in the paper [34] is the one introduced by Steenbrink
[35] very recently with the help of the semi-stable reduction theorem and it is not clear
to us if it coincides with the classical (and more standard) one of Denef-Loeser [6], [7]
and Guibert-Loeser-Merle [13] etc. (see also Raibaut [27] for a nice introduction to this
subject). Moreover the arguments in [34] heavily depend on some deep technical results
in recent tropical geometry. It is therefore desirable to use the classical motivic nearby
ﬁbers and describe them without using the tropical geometry. The aim of this paper is to
simplify Stapledon’s arguments and extend his results to families of sch¨on complete inter-
section subvarieties in Cn. Moreover, by extending our previous results in [10], [21], [37]
etc., as in [37] we show that some parts of the Jordan normal forms of the monodromies
on H j(Yt; C) (0 < |t| < ε) can be described very explicitly.
In order to explain these
results, let us explain our geometric situation and notations brieﬂy. Let K = C(t) be the
ﬁeld of rational functions of t and f (t, x) =Pv∈Zn av(t)xv ∈ K[x±
n ] (av(t) ∈ K) a
Laurent polynomial of x = (x1, . . . , xn) with coeﬃcients in K. Then we deﬁne a family
Y ⊂ B(0; ε)∗×(C∗)n of hypersurfaces in the algebraic torus (C∗)n over the punctured disk
B(0; ε)∗ by Y = f −1(0) ⊂ B(0; ε)∗× (C∗)n. If f has a very special form f (t, x) = 1− tg(x)
for some Laurent polynomial g(x) ∈ C[x±
n ] the monodromy of Y around the origin
0 ∈ C is nothing but the monodromy at inﬁnity of the polynomial map g : (C∗)n −→ C.
In this sense, our setting contains the classical one of [3], [10], [12], [19], [20], [21], [23], [26],
[29], [30], [32], [38] etc. For v ∈ Zn by the Laurent expansion av(t) =Pj∈Z av,jtj (av,j ∈ C)

of the rational function av(t) we set

1 , . . . , x±

1 , . . . , x±

o(v) := ordt av(t) = min{j | av,j 6= 0}.

If av(t) ≡ 0 we set o(v) = +∞. Then we deﬁne an (unbounded) polyhedron UHf in Rn+1
by

UHf = Conv(cid:2)[v∈Zn{(v, s) | s ≥ o(v)}(cid:3) ⊂ Rn+1,

where Conv (∗) stands for the convex hull. We call it the upper-half of f . Throughout
this paper we assume that the dimension of UHf is n + 1. Then by the projection
p : Rn+1 = Rn× R1 ։ Rn we obtain an n-dimensional polytope P := p(UHf ) ⊂ Rn which
we call the Newton polytope of f . Let νf : P → R be the function deﬁning the bottom
part of the boundary ∂UHf of UHf and S the subdivision of P by the lattice polytopes
p(eF ) ⊂ Rn (eF ≺ UHf ). We call such F = p(eF ) ∈ S a cell in S. We denote by rel.intF its
relative interior i.e. its interior in the aﬃne span Aﬀ(F ) ≃ RdimF of F . Then by deﬁning a
hypersurface VF of the algebraic torus TF = Spec(C[Aﬀ(F )∩Zn]) ≃ (C∗)dimF for each cell
F ∈ S and the sch¨onness of the family Y etc. (see Section 3 for the details), we reobtain
the following beautiful result of Stapledon [34]. For the family Y over the punctured disk,
denote by ψt([Y ]) ∈ Mˆµ
C its motivic nearby ﬁber by the function t = idC : C −→ C (see
Section 2 for the details).

Theorem 1.1. Assume that the family Y is sch¨on. Then we have an equality

ψt([Y ]) = Xrel.intF ⊂IntP

[VF (cid:9) ˆµ] · (1 − L)n−dimF

in Mˆµ
C.

We prove this theorem by using only the classical toric geometry and a result
of Guibert-Loeser-Merle [13] (see Theorem 2.1). Then in Section 4 we apply it to
families Y ⊂ B(0; ε)∗ × Cn of sch¨on hypersurfaces in Cn and describe some parts of the
Jordan normal forms of the monodromies on H j(Yt; C) (0 < |t| < ε) explicity. More
precisely, as in [37] we deﬁne a ﬁnite subset Rf of C and describe the Jordan normal
forms for the eigenvalues λ /∈ Rf . Moreover in Section 5, we shall also extend the
results of [34] to families of sch¨on complete intersection subvarieties in Cn and obtain
a formula for the Jordan normal forms of their monodromies. See Section 5 for the details.

2 Preliminary notions and results

In this section, we introduce some preliminary notions and results which will be used in
this paper.

2.1 Motivic nearby ﬁbers

Throughtout this paper we consider only varieties over the ﬁeld C of complex numbers.
From now we shall introduce the theory of motivic nearby ﬁbers of Denef-Loeser [6], [7]
and Guibert-Loeser-Merle [13] in this special case (see also Raibaut [27]). For a variety
S denote by K0(VarS) the Grothendieck ring of varieties over S. Recall that the ring
structure is deﬁned by the ﬁber products over S. Moreover we denote by MS the ring
obtained from it by inverting the Lefschetz motive L ≃ C×S ∈ K0(VarS). If S = Spec(C)
we denote K0(VarS) and MS simply by K0(VarC) and MC respectively. Note that MS has
a natural structure of an MC-module. For d ∈ Z>0, let µd = {ζ ∈ C | ζ d = 1} ≃ Z/Zd be
the multiplicative group consisting of d roots of unity in C. We denote by ˆµ the projective
µd of the projective system {µi}i≥1 with morphisms µid −→ µi given by t 7−→ td.
limit lim←−d
Then we deﬁne the Grothendieck ring Kˆµ
0 (VarS) of varieties over S with good ˆµ-actions
and its localization Mˆµ
S is naturally a MC-module.
Recall also that for a morphism π : S −→ S′ of varieties we have a group homomorphism
(2.1)

S as in [7, Section 2.4]. Note that Mˆµ

S′

π! : Mˆµ

S −→ Mˆµ

obtained by the composition with π. Now let Z be a smooth variety and U ⊂ Z its
Zariski open subset such that D = Z \ U is a normal crossing divisor in Z. Moreover let
f : Z −→ C be a regular function on Z such that f −1(0) ⊂ Z is contained in D. Set
Ω = Int(U ∪ f −1(0)) and let E1, E2, . . . , Ek be the irreducible components of the normal

3

crossing divisor Ω ∩ f −1(0) in Ω ⊂ Z. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, let bi > 0 be the order of the
zero of f along Ei. For a non-empty subset I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , k}, let us set

EI =\i∈I

Ei,

E◦

I = EI \[i6∈I

Ei

(2.2)

I of E◦

I −→ E◦

I as follows. First, for a point p ∈ E◦

and dI = gcd(bi)i∈I > 0. Then, as in [7, Section 3.3], we can construct an unramiﬁed
Galois covering fE◦
I we take an aﬃne
open neighborhood W ⊂ Ω\ (∪i /∈IEi) of p on which there exist regular functions ξi (i ∈ I)
such that Ei ∩ W = {ξi = 0} for any i ∈ I. Then on W we have f = f1,W (f2,W )dI ,
where we set f1,W = fQi∈I ξ−bi
. Note that f1,W is a unit on W and
f2,W : W −→ C is a regular function. It is easy to see that E◦
I is covered by such aﬃne
open subsets W of Ω \ (∪i /∈IEi). Then as in [7, Section 3.3] by gluing the varieties

and f2,W =Qi∈I ξ

I,W = {(t, z) ∈ C∗ × (E◦

I . This unramiﬁed Galois
I admits a natural µdI -action deﬁned by assigning the automorphism

I over E◦

:= exp(2π√−1/dI) ∈ µdI . Namely the

I of E◦

together in an obvious way, we obtain the variety fE◦

I to the generator ζdI

I is equipped with a good ˆµ-action in the sense of [7, Section 2.4] and deﬁnes an
I ] of Mˆµ

f −1(0). Finally we set

SSf,U =XI6=∅

(1 − L)|I|−1 · [fE◦

I ] ∈ Mˆµ

f −1(0).

(2.4)

Then we have the following result.

Theorem 2.1. ([13, Theorem 3.9]) Let X be a variety and g : X −→ C a regular function
on it. Then there exists a morphism of MC-modules
ψg : MX −→ Mˆµ

(2.5)

g−1(0)

such that for any proper morphism π : Z −→ X from a smooth variety Z and its Zariski
open subset U ⊂ Z whose complement D = Z \ U is a normal crossing divisor in Z
containing (g ◦ π)−1(0) we have the equality

ψg([U −→ X]) = (π|(g◦π)−1(0))!(SSg◦π,U )

(2.6)

g−1(0).

in Mˆµ
Deﬁnition 2.2. In the situation of Theorem 2.1, for a variety [Y −→ X] ∈ MX over X
we call ψg([Y −→ X]) ∈ Mˆµ
g−1(0) the motivic nearby ﬁber of Y by g and denote it simply
by ψg([Y ]).

Following the notations in [7, Section 3.1.2 and 3.1.3], we denote by HSmon the abelian

category of Hodge structures with a quasi-unipotent endomorphism. Let

χh : Mˆµ

C −→ K0(HSmon)

4

(2.7)

be the Hodge characteristic morphism deﬁned in [7] which associates to a variety Z with
a good µd-action the Hodge structure

χh([Z]) =Xj∈Z

(−1)j[H j

c (Z; Q)] ∈ K0(HSmon)

(2.8)

with the actions induced by the one z 7−→ exp(2π√−1/d)z (z ∈ Z) on Z. We can

generalize this construction as follows. For a variety X let MHMX be the abelian category
of mixed Hodge modules on X (see [14, Section 8.3] etc.) and K0(MHMX ) its Grothendieck
ring. Then there exists a group homomorphism

HX : MX −→ K0(MHMX)

(2.9)

such that for any morphism π : Z −→ X from a smooth variety Z and the trivial Hodge
module QZ on it we have

HX([Z −→ X]) =Xj∈Z

(−1)j[H jRπ!(QZ)].

(2.10)

Here the Grothendieck ring K0(MHMX ) has a natural MC-module structure by the Hodge
realization map H : MC −→ K0(MHMSpec(C)) and HX is moreover MC-linear. By using
the abelian category MHMmon
of mixed Hodge modules on X with a ﬁnite order auto-
morphism and its Grothendieck ring K0(MHMmon
X ) we have also a group homomorphism

X

X : Mˆµ
H mon

X −→ K0(MHMmon
X )

(2.11)

(see [13] for the details).

2.2 Equivariant Ehrhart theory of Katz and Stapledon

In this section, we introduce some polynomials in the Equivariant Ehrhart theory in Katz-
Stapledon [16] and Stapledon [34]. Throughout this paper, we regard the empty set ∅ as
a (−1)-dimensional polytope, and as a face of any polytope. Let P be a polytope. If a
subset F ⊂ P is a face of P , we write F ≺ P . For a pair of faces F ≺ F ′ ≺ P of P , we
denote by [F, F ′] the face poset {F ′′ ≺ P | F ≺ F ′′ ≺ F ′}, and by [F, F ′]∗ a poset which
is equal to [F, F ′] as a set with the reversed order.

Deﬁnition 2.4. Let B be a poset [F, F ′] or [F, F ′]∗. We deﬁne a polynomial g(B, t) of
degree ≤ (dimF ′ − dimF )/2 as follows. If F = F ′, we set g(B; t) = 1. If F 6= F ′ and

5

B = [F, F ′] (resp. B = [F, F ′]∗), we deﬁne g(B; t) inductively by

tdimF ′−dimF g(B; t−1) = XF ′′∈[F,F ′]
(resp. tdimF ′−dimF g(B; t−1) = XF ′′∈[F,F ′]∗

g([F, F ′′]; t).

(t − 1)dimF ′−dimF ′′
(t − 1)dimF ′′−dimF g([F ′′, F ′]∗; t).)

In what follows, we assume that P is a lattice polytope in Rn. Let S be a subset of
P ∩ Zn containing the vertices of P , and ω : S → Z be a function. We denote by UHω the
convex hull in Rn × R of the set {(v, s) ∈ Rn × R | v ∈ S, s ≥ ω(v)}. Then, the set of all
the projections of the bounded faces of UHω to Rn deﬁnes a lattice polyhedral subdivision
S of P . Here a lattice polyhedral subdivision S of a polytope P is a set of some polytopes
in P such that the intersection of any two polytopes in S is a face of both and all vertices
of any polytope in S are in Zn. Moreover, the set of all the bounded faces of UHω deﬁnes
a piecewise Q-aﬃne convex function ν : P → R. For a cell F ∈ S, we denote by σ(F ) the
smallest face of P containing F , and lkS(F ) the set of all cell of S containing F . We call
lkS(F ) the link of F in S. Note that σ(∅) = ∅ and lkS(∅) = S.
Deﬁnition 2.5. For F ∈ S, the h-polynomial h(lkS(F ); t) of the link lkS(F ) of F is
deﬁned by

tdimP −dimF h(lkS(F ); t−1) = XF ′∈lkS (F )

g([F, F ′]; t)(t − 1)dimP −dimF ′

.

The local h-polynomial lP (S, F ; t) of F in S is deﬁned by

lP (S, F ; t) = Xσ(F )≺Q≺P

(−1)dimP −dimQh(lkS|Q(F ); t)g([Q, P ]∗; t).

For λ ∈ C, m ∈ Z≥0 and v ∈ mP ∩ Zn, we set

λ(P, ν; u) ∈ Z[u] by

We deﬁne the λ-weighted Ehrhart polynomial fλ(P, ν; m) ∈ Z[m] of P with respect to
ν : P → R by

fλ(P, ν; m) is a polynomial in m with coeﬃcients Z whose degree is ≤ dimP (see [34]).

3 Monodromies and limit mixed Hodge structures of

families of hypersurfaces in algebraic tori (C∗)n

K[x±

1 , . . . , x±

Let K = C(t) be the ﬁeld of rational functions of t and f (t, x) = Pv∈Zn av(t)xv ∈
n ] (av(t) ∈ K) a Laurent polynomial of x = (x1, . . . , xn) with coeﬃcients in
K. For v ∈ Zn by the Laurent expansion av(t) = Pj∈Z av,jtj (av,j ∈ C) of the rational

function av(t) we set

o(v) := ordt av(t) = min{j | av,j 6= 0}.

If av(t) ≡ 0 we set o(v) = +∞. Then we deﬁne an (unbounded) polyhedron UHf in Rn+1
by

UHf = Conv(cid:2)[v∈Zn{(v, s) | s ≥ o(v)}(cid:3) ⊂ Rn+1,

where Conv (∗) stands for the convex hull. Throughout this paper we assume that the
dimension of UHf is n + 1. Then by the projection p : Rn+1 = Rn × R1 ։ Rn we obtain
an n-dimensional polytope P := p(UHf ) ⊂ Rn. We call it the Newton polytope of f . Let
Σ0 be the dual fan of UHf in Rn × R1
+ ⊂ Rn+1. We call its subfan Ξ0 in Rn ≃ Rn × {0}
consisting of cones σ ∈ Σ0 contained in Rn × {0} ⊂ Rn+1 the recession fan of UHf . Let
νf : P → R be the function deﬁning the bottom part of the boundary ∂UHf of UHf and
S the subdivision of P by the lattice polytopes p(eF ) ⊂ Rn (eF ≺ UHf ). Then for each cell
F in S the restriction νf|F of νf to F ⊂ P is an aﬃne Q-linear function taking integral
values on the vertices of F . Let us identify the aﬃne subspace Rn × {1} ⊂ Rn+1 of Rn+1

7

with Rn by the projection. Then by using the cones σ ∈ Σ0 such that dimσ < n + 1 we
deﬁne a polyhedral hypersurface Trop(Y ) in Rn × {1} ≃ Rn by

Trop(Y ) = [dimσ<n+1nσ ∩ (Rn × {1})o ⊂ Rn × {1} ≃ Rn.

We call it the tropical variety of Y (see [28] etc.). It has a decomposition

Trop(Y ) = Gdimσ<n+1nrel.intσ ∩ (Rn × {1})o

into the cells rel.intσ ∩ (Rn × {1}) ⊂ Trop(Y ). It is clear that there exists a one to one
correspondence between the cells F in S such that dimF > 0 and those in Trop(Y ). In
[34] the author used the cell decomposition of Trop(Y ) to express the motivic nearby ﬁber
ψt([Y ]). However in this paper, we use only the subdivision S of P . For a cell F in S
by taking the (unique) face eF ≺ UHf of UHf on the bottom part of ∂UHf such that
F = p(eF ) we deﬁne the initial Laurent polynomial I F

f (x) ∈ C[x±

I F

f (x) = X(v,j)∈ eF

By identifying Aﬀ(F )∩ Zn with ZdimF we may consider I F
f (x) as a Laurent polynomial on
the algebraic torus TF = Spec(C[Aﬀ(F ) ∩ Zn]) ≃ (C∗)dimF . We denote by VF ⊂ TF the
hypersurface deﬁned by I F
f (x) in TF . By the aﬃne Q-linear extension νF : Aﬀ(F ) →
R of νf|F to Aﬀ(F ) ≃ RdimF we deﬁne an element eF of the algebraic torus TF =
Spec(C[Aﬀ(F ) ∩ Zn]) ≃ Homgroup(Aﬀ(F ) ∩ Zn, C∗) by

eF (v) = exp(cid:16)2π√−1νF (v)(cid:17)

(v ∈ Aﬀ(F ) ∩ Zn).

Then by the multiplication ℓeF : TF
obtain an element [VF (cid:9) ˆµ] ∈ Mˆµ
a family Y of hypersurfaces of T0 = (C∗)n
C | 0 < |t| < ε} (0 < ε ≪ 1). By the projection π : T = C∗
t × (C∗)n
that 0 < |t| < ε we set Yt := π−1(t) ∩ Y ⊂ {t} × T0 ≃ T0 ≃ (C∗)n
x.
Deﬁnition 3.1. We say that the family Y of hypersurfaces {Yt}0<|t|<ε of T0 ≃ (C∗)n
sch¨on if for any cell F in S the hypersurface VF ⊂ TF of TF is smooth and reduced.

∼−→ TF by eF ∈ TF we have ℓeF (VF ) = VF . We thus

For the family Y over the punctured disk, denote by ψt([Y ]) ∈ Mˆµ

C its motivic nearby
ﬁber by the function t = idC : C → C (see Section 2). Then the following beautiful result
was ﬁrst obtained by Stapledon [34].

Theorem 3.2. Assume that the family Y is sch¨on. Then we have an equality

ψt([Y ]) = Xrel.intF ⊂IntP

Proof. Let Σ be a smooth subdivision of the dual fan Σ0 of UHf and Ξ its subfan in
Rn ≃ Rn × {0} consisting of cones σ ∈ Σ contained in Rn × {0} ⊂ Rn+1. We denote by
Λ the fan {{0}, R1
+ in R1. Let XΣ
(resp. XΞ) be the toric variety associated to Σ (resp. Ξ). Then by the morphism Σ → Λ
of fans induced by the projection Rn × R1

πΣ : XΣ −→ C

of toric varieties. Restricting it to C∗ ⊂ C, we obtain the projection C∗ × XΞ ։ C∗ which
extends naturally the previous one π : T = C∗ × T0 ։ C∗. Let ρ1, . . . , ρl ∈ Σ be rays i.e.
1-dimensional cones in Σ such that ρi ∩ (Rn × {0}) = {0} ( ⇐⇒ ρi /∈ Ξ). For 1 ≤ i ≤ l
denote by Ti ≃ (C∗)n ⊂ XΣ the T -orbit in XΣ associated to ρi and satisfying the property
πΣ(Ti) = {0} ⊂ C. We can easily see that for their closures Ti ⊂ XΣ in XΣ we have

π−1
Σ ({0}) =

l[i=1

Ti.

For 1 ≤ i ≤ l let ~pi ∈ ρi ∩ (Zn+1 \ {0}) be the primitive vector on the ray ρi. We deﬁne a
positive integer mi > 0 by mi = q(~pi), where q : Rn+1 = Rn × R1 ։ R1 is the projection.
Then it is easy to see that the order of the zeros of the function t ◦ πΣ : XΣ → C along
the toric divisor Ti ⊂ XΣ is equal to mi. For a cone σ ∈ Σ such that σ ∩ (Rn ×{0}) = {0}
we set mσ = gcd{mi | ρi ≺ σ} > 0 and denote by fFσ ≺ UHf its supporting face in UHf .
Then by the sch¨onness of Y , the closure Y of Y ⊂ T ⊂ XΣ in XΣ intersects the T -orbit
Tσ ≃ (C∗)n+1−dimσ ⊂ XΣ in XΣ associated to σ transversally. Moreover the resulting
smooth hypersurface Wσ := Y ∩ Tσ ⊂ Tσ of Tσ is deﬁned by the fFσ-part of f (t, x). Let

be the disjoint union of mσ copies of Wσ and deﬁne its automorphism by

fWσ := Wσ ⊔ · · ·· · · ⊔ Wσ

equality

For the class [fWσ] ∈ Mˆµ
(cid:9) ˆµ] · (L − 1)n+1−dimσ−dimFσ ,
where we set Fσ = p(fFσ) ∈ S. Then by Theorem 2.1 we have

(z1, . . . , zmσ ) 7−→ (zmσ , z1, . . . , zmσ−1).
C of the variety fWσ with this action of ˆµ we can easily show the
[fWσ] = [VFσ
ψt([Y ]) = Xσ∩(Rn×{0})={0}

By the proof of Matsui-Takeuchi [21, Theorem 5.7 and Proposition 5.5] we obtain the
desired formula

(see also Stapledon [34, Example 2.2]).

Remark 3.3. As is clear from the above proof of Theorem 3.2, it can be immediately
generalized to any sch¨on family of subvarieties of T0 ≃ (C∗)n as in [34, Theorem 3.2 and
Corollary 5.3]. However in this paper, we do not use such a generalization.

Recall that for a constructible sheaf F ∈ Db
Db
c ({0}) by the function t has a direct sum decomposition
ψt(F ) =Mλ∈C

ψt,λ(F )

c (C) on C its nearby cycle sheaf ψt(F ) ∈

with respect to the generalized eigenspaces ψt,λ(F ) ∈ Db
c ({0}) for eigenvalues λ ∈ C (see
Dimca [8] etc.). Let j : B(0; ε)∗ ֒→ B(0; ε) = B(0; ε)∗ ⊔ {0} be the inclusion map. From
now, as a byproduct of the proof of the above theorem we will show that the morphism

ψt,λ(j!Rπ!CY ) −→ ψt,λ(j!Rπ∗CY )

induced by the one Rπ!CY → Rπ∗CY is an isomorphism for λ ∈ C satisfying some
condition deﬁned by UHf . Let Σ be a smooth subdivision of the dual fan Σ0 of UHf and
Ξ its subfan in Rn × Rn × {0} consisting of cones σ ∈ Σ contained in Rn × {0} ⊂ Rn+1.
Then we say that a ray ρ ∈ Σ in Σ is adjacent to Ξ if there exist cones σ ∈ Σ and
τ ∈ Ξ such that ρ ≺ σ and τ ≺ σ. We denote the set of the rays in Σ which are
adjacent to Ξ by AR(Σ) ⊂ Σ. For a ray ρ ∈ AR(Σ) in AR(Σ), taking the primitive
vector ~p ∈ ρ ∩ (Zn+1 \ {0}) on it we deﬁne a positive integer mρ > 0 by mρ = q(~p), where
q : Rn+1 = Rn × R1 → R1 is the projection. Deﬁne a ﬁnite subset Af,Σ ⊂ C of C by

Af,Σ = [ρ∈AR(Σ)

{λ ∈ C | λmρ = 1} ⊂ C.

Taking their intersection we ﬁnally set

Af =\Σ

Af,Σ ⊂ C.

We do not know how to calculate the ﬁnite set Af from UHf . But we always have an
upper bound Af,Σ of Af .

Theorem 3.4. Assume that the family Y is sch¨on. Then for any λ /∈ Af the morphism

ψt,λ(j!Rπ!CY ) −→ ψt,λ(j!Rπ∗CY )

induced by the one Rπ!CY → Rπ∗CY is an isomorphism.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of Takeuchi-Tibar [37, Theorem 4.5]. For λ /∈ Af we
ﬁrst take a smooth subdivision Σ of Σ0 such that λ /∈ Af,Σ. Let XΣ be the (smooth)
toric variety associated to Σ and ιT : T = (C∗)n+1 = C∗
x ֒→ XΣ, j : C∗ ֒→ C the
inclusion maps. Recall that we have a natural morphism πΣ : XΣ → C. Then there exists

Set D = XΣ\T and let iD : D ֒→ XΣ be the inclusion map. Let Y be the closure of Y ⊂ T
in XΣ and πY = πΣ|Y : Y → C the restriction of πΣ to it. Then by the sch¨onness of Y
the hypersurface Y ⊂ XΣ intersects T -orbits in π−1
Σ ({0}) transversally. This in particular
implies that Y is smooth on a neighborhood of π−1
Σ ({0}) in XΣ. Let Ξ be the subfan of
Σ in Rn ≃ Rn × {0} consisting of cones σ ∈ Σ contained in Rn ≃ Rn × {0}. Then for any
cone σ ∈ Ξ the hypersurface Y intersects the T -orbit Tσ associated to it transversally on
a neighborhood of π−1
Σ ({0}) in XΣ. Since πΣ : XΣ → C is proper, we have isomorphisms

(cid:26) ψt(j!Rπ!CY ) ≃ ψt(R(πΣ)∗(ιT )!CY ),
ψt(j!Rπ∗CY ) ≃ ψt(Rj∗Rπ∗CY ) ≃ ψt(R(πΣ)∗R(ιT )∗CY ).

Therefore, by applying the functor ψt ◦ R(πΣ)∗ : Db(XΣ) → Db({0}) to the distinguished
triangle

we obtain the new one

(ιT )!CY → R(ιT )∗CY → (iD)∗(iD)−1R(ιT )∗CY

ψt(Rπ!CY ) → ψt(Rπ∗CY ) → ψt(R(πD)∗(iD)−1R(ιT )∗CY ) +1−→,

where πD : D → C is the restriction of πΣ to D ⊂ XΣ. This implies that for the proof of
the theorem it suﬃces to prove the vanishing

ψt,λ(R(πD)∗(iD)−1R(ιT )∗CY ) ≃ 0

for λ /∈ Af,Σ. Since Y is smooth and the divisor D ∩ Y ⊂ Y in it is normal crossing on a
neighborhood of π−1

Σ ({0}) we have only to prove the vanishing
ψt,λ(R(πD)∗CD∩Y ) ≃ RΓ(π−1

D ({0}); ψt◦πD,λ(CD∩Y )) ≃ 0

for λ /∈ Af,Σ. Note that for a ray ρ ∈ AR(Σ) the order of the zeros of the function
t ◦ πΣ along the toric divisor Tρ ⊂ XΣ associated to it is equal to mρ > 0. Hence, by the
condition λ /∈ Af,Σ we have λmρ 6= 1 for any ρ ∈ AR(Σ) and obtain the vanishing

ψt◦πD,λ(CD∩Y ) ≃ 0

proof.

D ({0}) ∩ Y . Then the assertion immediately follows from it. This completes the

By the proof of the above theorem we obtain the following result.

Lemma 3.5. Assume that the family Y is sch¨on. Then there exists small ε > 0 such that
the hypersurface Yt = Y ∩ π−1(t) ⊂ T0 = (C∗)n
x is Newton non-degenerate (see [25]) for
any t ∈ C∗ satisfying the condition 0 < |t| < ε.
Proposition 3.6. Assume that the family Y is sch¨on. Then for t ∈ C∗ such that 0 <
|t| ≪ 1 we have

c (Yt; C) ≃ 0

(j < n − 1)

and the Gysin map

c (Yt; C) −→ H j+2
H j

c

(T0; C)

associated to the inclusion map Yt ֒→ T0 is an isomorphism (resp. surjective) for j > n−1
(resp. j = n − 1). Moreover the monodromy Φj : H j
c (Yt; C) is identity for
any j > n − 1.

c (Yt; C) ∼−→ H j

11

Proof. Since Yt ⊂ T0 is smooth and aﬃne, the ﬁrst assertion follows from the (generalized)
Poincar´e duality theorem
c (Yt; C) ≃ [H 2n−2−j(Yt; C)]∗
H j

(j ∈ Z).

Moreover by the above lemma, the second assertion follows from the weak Lefschetz
theorem (see Danilov-Khovanskii [4, Proposition 3.9]) for the Newton non-degenerate
hypersurface Yt ⊂ T0 = (C∗)n

x. Note also that the morphism
ψt(j!Rπ!CT ) −→ ψt(j!Rπ!CY )

induced by the one CT → CY is compatible with the monodromy automorphisms on
ψt(j!Rπ!CT ) and ψt(j!Rπ!CY ). Then the remaining assertion follows immediately from
the ﬁrst one.

Now let X be a general variety and for 0 < ε ≪ 1 consider a family Y ⊂ B(0; ε)∗ × X
of subvarieties of X over the punctured disk B(0; ε)∗ ⊂ C. Let π : B(0; ε)∗×X → B(0; ε)∗
be the projection and for t ∈ C such that 0 < |t| < ε set Yt = Y ∩ π−1(t) ⊂ X. By the
rotation on the punctured disk we obtain the monodromy automorphisms

for 0 < |t| < ε. For λ ∈ C let

for any λ ∈ C. Considering the mixed Hodge module over the left hand side
H jψt,λ(j!Rπ!CY ) we can endow the right hand side H j
c (Yt; C)λ with a mixed Hodge struc-
ture which coincides with the limit mixed Hodge structure (see El Zein [9] and Steenbrink-
Zucker [36] etc.). The weight ﬁltration M• on it is the “relative” monodromy ﬁltration
with respect to its Deligne’s weight ﬁltration W• in the following sence. Let Φu
j be the
unipotent part of the monodromy Φj and set N = log Φu
c (Yt; C). Then
for any r ∈ Z the ﬁltration M(r)• on the graded piece Vr = GrW
c (Yt; C) induced by

By this deﬁnition, obviously we have Eλ(Yt; u, v, 1) = Eλ(Yt; u, v) for any λ ∈ C. Now
let us return to the family Y ⊂ B(0; ε)∗ × (C∗)n of hypersurfaces of T0 = (C∗)n over the
punctured disk B(0; ε)∗. Then by Theorem 3.2 we obtain the following corollary.
Corollary 3.8. Assume that the family Y ⊂ B(0; ε)∗ × (C∗)n is sch¨on. Then we have

It follows also from the proof of Sabbah [30, Theorem 13.1] that the only non-trivial

(Yt; C)λ has pure weight of n − 1. This implies that the poly-
nomial Eλ(Yt; u, v, w) ∈ Z[u, v, w] is concentrated in degree n − 1 in the valuable w.
By the construction of the limit mixed Hodge structure of H n−1
(Yt; C)λ, the weight
ﬁltration on it is equal to the monodromy ﬁltration of the monodromy automorphism

Let f (t, x) = Pv∈Zn
av(t)xv ∈ K[x1, . . . , xn] (av(x) ∈ K) be a polynomial of x =
(x1, . . . , xn) over the ﬁeld K = C(t) of rational functions of t. Then as in Section 3 we
can deﬁne an (unbounded) polyhedron UHf associated to it in Rn
+× R1 and its projection
P = p(UHf ) ⊂ Rn
+. We call P the Newton polytope of f ∈ K[x1, . . . , xn]. Throughout
this section we assume that P is convenient, i.e. for any coordinate subspace H of Rn we
have dimP ∩ H = dimH. In particular we assume that the origin 0 ∈ Rn is contained in
P . Let Σ0 be the dual fan of UHf in Rn×R1
+ ⊂ Rn+1 and νf : P → R the function deﬁning
the bottom part of the boundary ∂UHf of UHf . Moreover by the subdivision S of P into
the lattice polytopes p(eF ) (eF ≺ UHf ) we deﬁne polynomials I F
f (x) ∈ C[x1, . . . , xn] and
elements [VF (cid:9) ˆµ] ∈ Mˆµ
C as in Section 3. In this situation,
the hypersurface f −1(0) ⊂ X = C∗

over a small punctured disk B(0; ε)∗ (0 < ε ≪ 1). By the projection π : C∗
t × Cn
t
for t ∈ C such that 0 < |t| < ε we set Yt := π−1(t) ∩ Y ⊂ {t} × X0 ≃ X0 = Cn
x. Then
we deﬁne the sch¨onness of the family as in Deﬁnition 3.1 . Furthermore we deﬁne a ﬁnite
subset Af ⊂ C by using smooth subdivisions Σ of the dual fan Σ0 as follows. Let Σ
be a smooth subdivision of Σ0 containing Rn
+ × {0} and Ξ its subfan in Rn ≃ Rn × {0}
consisting of cones σ ∈ Σ contained in Rn ×{0} ⊂ Rn+1. Then we say that a ray ρ ∈ Σ is
adjacent to Ξ outside Rn
+ if there exist cones σ ∈ Σ and τ ∈ Ξ such that ρ ≺ σ, τ ≺ σ and
τ 6⊂ Rn

Since the proof of the following theorem is similar to that of Theorem 3.4, we omit it.

Theorem 4.1. Assume that the family Y of hypersurfaces in X0 = Cn is sch¨on. Then
for any λ /∈ Af the morphism

ψt,λ(j!Rπ!CY ) −→ ψt,λ(j!Rπ∗CY )

induced by the one Rπ!CY → Rπ∗CY is an isomorphism.

We have also the following proposition.

By Theorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2 we can easily obtain results similar to the ones

in Corollary 3.8 and Theorems 3.9 and 3.10.

Deﬁnition 4.3. (Stapledon [34]) We say that the polynomial f (t, x) =Pv∈Zn
av(t)xv ∈
K[x1, . . . , xn] satisﬁes the condition (S) if the function νf : P → R is constant on P∞ :=

The following result was proved in Stapledon [34] by calculating the related equivariant

mixed Hodge polynomials Eλ(Yt; u, v, w) ∈ Z[u, v, w] very precisely.
Theorem 4.4. (Stapledon [34, Corollary 6.3]) Assume that the family Y of hypersurfaces
in X0 = Cn is sch¨on and f (t, x) ∈ K[x1, . . . , xn] satisﬁes the condition (S). Then for any
λ 6= 1 the equivariant reﬁned limit mixed Hodge polynomial Eλ(Yt; u, v, w) ∈ Z[u, v, w] for
the eigenvalue λ is concentrated in degree n − 1 in the variable w.

We can drop the condition (S) in Theorem 4.4 as follows. For a face Q ≺ P of P such

that 0 /∈ Q we deﬁne a ﬁnite subset Rf,Q ⊂ C containing 1 ∈ C as in Section 3 and set

Rf := [Q≺P, 0 /∈Q

In this section, we extend our previous results to families complete intersection subvarieties
in (C∗)n or Cn. Throughout this section, for 1 ≤ k ≤ n let fi(t, x) (1 ≤ i ≤ k) be
Laurent polynomials fi(t, x) = Pv∈Zn ai,v(t)xv ∈ K[x±

We shall describe its monodromy and limit mixed Hodge structure. As in Section 3 we
deﬁne UHfi ⊂ Rn+1 = Rn × Rs and their second projections Pi = p(UHfi) ⊂ Rn.
If
fi ∈ K[x±
n ] (1 ≤ i ≤ k), we assume that dimUHfi = n + 1 for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k. If
fi ∈ K[x1, . . . , xn] (1 ≤ i ≤ k), we assume moreover that Pi is convenient for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k
i.e. for any coordinate subspace H of Rn and 1 ≤ i ≤ k we have dimPi ∩ H = dimH. Set

Deﬁnition 5.1. (Stapledon [34]) We say that the family Y = f −1
k (0) of
subvarieties of T0 = (C∗)n or X0 = Cn is sch¨on if for any J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} and any cell
F ∈ S the subvariety VF = Tj∈J{I F
j = 0} ⊂ TF of TF ≃ (C∗)dimF is a non-degenerate
complete intersection (see [25]).

1 (0) ∩ · · · ∩ f −1

It follows easily from the proof of Theorems 3.2 and 3.4 that if the family Y is sch¨on
its generic ﬁber Yt = Y ∩ π−1(t) (0 < |t| ≪ 1) in T0 = (C∗)n or X0 = Cn is a smooth
complete intersection. Moreover by Danilov-Khovanskii [4, Theorem 6.4] we obtain the
following results.
Proposition 5.2. Let Y = f −1
k (0) be a family of subvarieties in T0 =
(C∗)n (resp. X0 = Cn). Assume that Y is sch¨on. Then for t ∈ C∗ such that 0 < |t| ≪ 1
we have

and surjective for j = n − k. Moreover the monodromy Φj : H j
c (Yt; C) is
identity for j > n − k.

c (Yt; C) ∼−→ H j

Deﬁning a ﬁnite subset Af ⊂ C by UHf as in Section 3, we obtain the following result.
k (0) be a family of subvarieties of X0 = Cn.

(5.1)

Theorem 5.3. Let Y = f −1
Assume that Y is sch¨on. Then for any λ /∈ Af the morphism
ψt,λ(j!Rπ!CY ) −→ ψt,λ(j!Rπ∗CY )

1 (0) ∩ · · · ∩ f −1

induced by the one Rπ!CY → Rπ∗CY is an isomorphism.

As in Section 3, by these results we can describe some part of the Jordan normal form
(Yt; C) in terms of the

of the middle-dimensional monodromy Φn−k : H n−k
equivariant limit mixed Hodge polynomial Eλ(Yt; u, v) ∈ Z[u, v]. We omit the details.

where ej = (0, . . . ,

ˆ1, . . . , 0) ∈ RJ is the standard vector. Obviously, the image of UJ by
the projection pJ : RJ × Rn × Rs → RJ × Rn is PJ . We write ep, eU and eP for p{1,...,k},
U{1,...,k} and P{1,...,k}, respectively. Let eν : eP → R be the function deﬁning the bottom
part of the boundary ∂eU of eU and eS the subdivision of eP by the lattice polytopes ep(eF ) ⊂
eP (eF ≺ eU ). By the assumption that the dimension of Pj is n, we have dimUJ = n + |J|
and dimPJ = n + |J| − 1. We obtain the following generalization of Theorem 3.11 to
families of complete intersection subvarieties of (C∗)n.

Theorem 5.4. Let Y = f −1
k (0) be a family of subvarieties of T0 = (C∗)n.
Assume that Y is sch¨on. Then for t ∈ C∗ such that 0 < |t| ≪ 1 and any λ 6= 1
the equivariant reﬁned limit mixed Hodge polynomial Eλ(Yt; u, v, w) ∈ Z[u, v, w] for the
eigenvalue λ is given by

1 (0) ∩ · · · ∩ f −1

(uvw2)kEλ(Yt; u, v, w) = X∅6=J⊂{1,...,k}

(−1)n+|J|h∗

λ(PJ ,eν|PJ ; u, v, w).

Proof. We use the Cayley trick of Danilov-Khovanskii [4] in its reﬁned form of [10]. For
suﬃciently small ε > 0 we set B∗ = B(0, ε)∗ ⊂ C. Then we have Y ⊂ B∗ × T0. Moreover
we set

Ω := {(t, (x1, . . . , xn), [α1 : · · · : αk]) ∈ B∗ × T0 × Pk−1 |

kXi=1

αifi(t, x) 6= 0}.

Then there exists a projection Ω → (B∗ × T0) \ Y which is a locally trivial ﬁbration with
ﬁber Ck−1. Hence it follows from Theorem 2.1 that for t ∈ B∗ and any λ 6= 1 we have

Eλ(Ωt; u, v, w) = (uvw2)k−1Eλ(({t} × T0) \ Yt; u, v, w)

= (uvw2)k−1(Eλ({t} × T0; u, v, w) − Eλ(Yt; u, v, w))
= −(uvw2)k−1Eλ(Yt; u, v, w).

For each non-empty subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , k} we deﬁne a subset TJ of Pk−1 by

TJ := {[α1 : · · · : αk] ∈ Pk−1 | αj 6= 0 (j ∈ J), αj = 0 (j /∈ J)} ≃ (C∗)|J|−1.

Moreover we set

ΩJ := Ω ∩ (B∗ × T0 × TJ ),
YJ := (B∗ × T0 × TJ ) \ ΩJ
= {(t, (x1, . . . , xn), [α1 : · · · : αk]) ∈ B∗ × T0 × TJ | Xj∈J

αjfj(t, x) = 0}.
Then for t ∈ B∗ and λ 6= 1 we have a decomposition Ωt =FJ6=∅ ΩJ,t and hence

Eλ(ΩJ,t; u, v, w)

Eλ(Ωt; u, v, w) =XJ6=∅
=XJ6=∅
= −XJ6=∅

(Eλ({t} × T0 × TJ ; u, v, w) − Eλ(YJ,t; u, v, w))

Eλ(YJ,t; u, v, w).

We thus obtain the equality

(uvw2)k−1Eλ(Yt; u, v, w) =XJ6=∅

Eλ(YJ,t; u, v, w).

It is easy to check that YJ is sch¨on. Note that UJ is UHPj∈J αj fj . Therefore applying
Theorem 3.11 to the families YJ ⊂ B∗ × T0 × TJ we obtain

(uvw2)Eλ(YJ,t; u, v, w) = (−1)n+|J|h∗

λ(PJ ,eν|PJ ; u, v, w).

Now the assertion follows immediately.

For a possibly empty subset I ⊂ {1, . . . , n}, we deﬁne a subset T I of X0 = Cn by

T I := {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈ X0 | xi = 0 (i /∈ I), xi 6= 0 (i ∈ I)} ≃ (C∗)|I|.

1,I (0) ∩ · · · ∩ f −1

k,I (0), and a polytope P I
j

Then we have a decomposition X0 = FI⊂{1,...,n} T I. We also deﬁne a polynomial fj,I ∈
K[(xi)i∈I] by substituting 0 into all the variable xi (i /∈ I) of fj, a family of subvarieties
Y I of T I by Y I := f −1
:= Pj ∩ RI.
Moreover for each non-empty subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , k}, we deﬁne a family of subvarieties Y I
J := {(t, (x1, . . . , xn), [α1 : · · · : αk]) ∈ B∗×T I ×TJ | Pj∈J αjfj(t, x) = 0},

For a face Q ≺ eP (= P {1,...,n}

polytope P I

J except for the empty set and the set

{(J ′, Q′) | ∅ 6= J ′ ⊂ J,∅ 6= Q′ ≺Xj∈J ′

Proof. Take a non-empty face Q of P I
supporting face of P I
∅, and by Qj the supporting face of P I

J is Q. We denote by J ′ all elements j ∈ J such that Q∩({ej}×P I

J . There is a vector v = (vJ , vI) ∈ RJ × RI whose

Q = Conv([j∈J ′ {ej} × Qj).

assigning Q to (J ′, Q′), we obtain the desired correspondence.

Note that there exists a one to one correspondence between the set of all tuples of sup-
i (i ∈ J ′) by one vectors in RI \ {0} and the set of all non-empty faces
porting faces of P I
j . Therefore,

j . Thus, the tuple {Qj}j∈J ′ correspond to the face Q′ of Pj∈J ′ P I

of Pj∈J ′ P I
For any λ /∈ Rf , any J ′ ⊂ J and any Q′ ≺ Pj∈J ′ P I
j such that 0 /∈ Q′, we have
λ(Q,eν|Q; u, v) = 0, where we denote by Q the corresponding face to (J ′, Q′) by the

Corollary 5.7. In the situation of Theorem 5.5, moreover we assume that fi satisﬁes the
condition (S) for any 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Then for any λ 6= 1 the equivariant reﬁned limit mixed
Hodge polynomial Eλ(Yt; u, v, w) ∈ Z[u, v, w] for the eigenvalue λ is concentrated in degree
n − k in the variable w.
Proof. Multiplying fi(t, x) by tm for some m ∈ Z, we may assume that νfi|Pi,∞ = 0 for
any 1 ≤ i ≤ k, where Pi,∞ is the union of all faces at inﬁnity of Pi (see Deﬁnition 4.3).
Then we have Rf = {1}. Now the assertion follows from Theorem 5.5.

By Theorem 5.5, for any λ /∈ Rf we can describe the Jordan normal form of the

monodromy automorphism

the local h-polynomial l eP (eS, F ; t) ∈ Z[t] has non-negative coeﬃcients and the symmetry

l eP (eS, F ; t) = tn+k−1−dimF l eP (eS, F ; t−1).

Moreover it is unimodal. Hence there exist non-negative integers lF,i (0 ≤ i ≤
