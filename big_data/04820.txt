Abstract
A thin single-element THGEM-based, Resistive-Plate WELL (RPWELL) detector was operated with 150 GeV/c muon and pion
beams in Ne/(5%CH4), Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2); signals were recorded with 1 cm2 square pads and SRS/APV25 electronics.
Detection eﬃciency values greater than 98% were reached in all the gas mixtures, at average pad multiplicity of 1.2. The use of
the 109Ωcm resistive plate resulted in a completely discharge-free operation also in intense pion beams. The eﬃciency remained
essentially constant at 98-99% up to ﬂuxes of ∼104Hz/cm2, dropping by a few % when approaching 105 Hz/cm2. These results pave
the way towards cost-eﬀective, robust, eﬃcient, large-scale detectors for a variety of applications in future particle, astro-particle
and applied ﬁelds. A potential target application is digital hadron calorimetry.

1. Introduction

The Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) is a robust
radiation detection element suitable for applications requiring
large detection areas [1, 2]. The broad interest in THGEM-
based detectors has resulted in the development of production
techniques and concepts (e.g. [3, 4]), including the use of re-
sistive ﬁlms and materials for reducing occasional discharge ef-
fects [5–7]. In this context, the experience gained with various
conﬁgurations of THGEM-based multipliers with resistive an-
odes [7–9] has led to the development of a particularly promis-
ing candidate - the Resistive-Plate WELL (RPWELL) [10]. It
is a single-sided copper-clad THGEM electrode, coupled to a
segmented readout anode (pads or strips) through a thin high
bulk-resistivity (∼108-1010 Ωcm) plate. Extensive laboratory
studies in Ne/(5%CH4) demonstrated discharge-free opera-
tion at high gas-avalanche gains and over a broad ionization
range [10]. Good performances in terms of eﬃciency and av-
erage pad multiplicity - studied in the context of future (Semi)
Digital Hadronic Calorimeter ((S)DHCAL) [11], were reached,
in Ne/(5%CH4) with 150 GeV/c muon and pion beams using a
thin 10×10 cm2 RPWELL, with a resistive anode (Semitron(cid:114)
ESD225) of bulk resistivity of ∼109Ωcm [12]. In the present
article we report on new results of further beam studies of
this detector, extended to the low-cost Ar-based gas mixtures
Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2). Detection eﬃciency values
of ∼98% were reached in all conditions, at average pad multi-
plicity of ∼1.2, in discharge-free operation, also with a high-

intensity pion ﬂux. The detector fulﬁll the requirements for
sampling elements in (S)DHCAL and has the potential for ap-
plications requiring robust, cheap, eﬃcient large-scale detectors
with moderate spacial and energy resolutions.

2. Experimental setup and methodology

2.1. RPWELL detector, tracking and readout system

The 10×10 cm2 RPWELL detector, its SRS/APV25 read-
out system [13, 14] and the experimental setup at the CERN-
SPS/H4 beam-line, were detailed in [12] and are brieﬂy de-
scribed here. The detector scheme, elements and operation
principle are shown in Fig. 1. The single-sided THGEM elec-
trode, 0.86 mm thick, had 0.5 mm diameter holes mechanically
drilled in an FR4 plate, copper-clad on one side. The holes were
arranged in a square lattice (Fig. 1-b), with 0.96 mm pitch, so
that they cover the underlying 1×1 cm2 anode pads, but not their
borders, where 0.86 mm wide metal bands are left, as described
in [8]. The plate was chemically etched, yielding 0.1 mm rims
around the holes, preventing sharp edges and eventual defects.
The THGEM electrode was coupled to the anode pads (Fig. 1-d)
through a 0.4 mm thick Semitron(cid:114) ESD2251 static dissipative
plastic plate (2×109 Ωcm bulk resistivity). The electrical con-
tact between the resistive plate and the readout pads is essential
for eﬃcient clearance of the avalanche electrons. Therefore,
the bottom of the resistive material was patterned with conduc-
tive pads (Fig. 1-c), individually connected to the anode pads

(d) are coupled to conductive pads patterned on the resistive
plate (c). The metal bands in (b) are located above the underly-
ing pad borders (c,d).

The detector electrodes were individually biased using
CAEN A1833P and A1821N HV power-supply boards, re-
motely controlled with a CAEN SY2527 unit. The voltage and
current in each channel were monitored and stored. All HV in-
puts were connected through low-pass ﬁlters. The RPWELL
bias (∆VRPWELL) with respect to the grounded anode was var-
ied throughout the experiment, while the drift voltage was kept
constant: ∆Vdri f t= 250 V - corresponding to a drift ﬁeld of
∼0.5 kV/cm across the 5 mm drift gap. The detector was oper-
ated in Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2) gas mixtures at atmo-
spheric pressure and room temperature, in gas-ﬂow mode (50-
100 cc/min); measurements in Ne/(5%CH4) were taken for
comparison. The operation in the Ar mixtures required higher
voltages compared to the ones in Ne/(5%CH4) to obtain sim-
ilar gains. However, with respect to Ne, Ar has the advantage
of larger number of electron-ion pairs produced by a minimum
ionizing particle (at normal conditions 94 compared to 39 e-i
pairs/cm [15]) - allowing for a smaller drift gap for equal num-
ber of primary charges - and considerably lower cost (which
might be crucial for large-scale systems). The use of CO2 in-
stead of CH4 as a photon quencher is preferable because the
former is non ﬂammable. The triggering, tracking and DAQ
system was the same as described in [12]. The RPWELL cham-
bers were placed along the beam line in-between the tracker
elements.

2.2. Working point: ∆VRPWELL, threshold and matching pa-

rameter

As described in [12], for each event the detector pads with
signal above threshold were grouped into clusters of neighbors.

The global detection eﬃciency was then calculated as the frac-
tion of particle tracks matched to a cluster in the detector, while
the average pad multiplicity was the average number of pads
contained in each cluster. The detector working point was ad-
justed to optimize its performance in each gas mixture, target-
ing high global detection eﬃciency at low average pad multi-
plicity. The lowest-possible value (closest to 1) of the latter is a
prerequisite for valid particle counting, e.g. in a potential appli-
cation as a sampling element in DHCAL [8, 16]. The optimiza-
tion was done using a set of measurements with ∼100 Hz/cm2
wide (5×5 cm2) muon beam and a ∼13000 Hz/cm2 narrow
(2×2 cm2) pion beam.
In both cases, only tracks hitting the
detector in a 4×4 cm2 central region were considered. Two im-
portant parameters in the analysis are the the threshold for zero
order suppression (ZSF) and the track-cluster matching param-
eter (W) (see details in [12]). The values of ZSF and W were
ﬁxed at ZSF= 15 and W= 10 or 15 mm following the same
method described in [12].

3. Results

pad multiplicity

We

studied the detector operation in Ne/(5%CH4),
Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2) using ∼100 Hz/cm2 muon
beam. Fig. 2 depicts the most probable value (MPV) of the
detected charge, derived from the recorded Landau distribu-
tions as a function of ∆VRPWELL. It is important to note that
the eﬀective measured charge is a few times smaller than the
avalanche charge; this results from the convolution of the long
signal rise time in the RPWELL (∼1-2 µs rise-time) and the
short shaping time of the APV25 chip (∼75 ns) - as described
in [12]. Fig. 3 shows the global detector eﬃciency as a func-
tion of the average pad multiplicity in the same data set shown
in Fig. 2. ∆VRPWELL values of 880 V, 1640 V and 1750 V

in Ne/(5%CH4), Ar/(5%CH4), and Ar/(7%CO2) respectively,
gave very high detection eﬃciency (98-99%) and low pad mul-
tiplicity (∼1.2) in a stable condition.

3.2. Performance under low and high particle ﬂux

The RPWELL performance was investigated with low-
rate muon and high rate pion beams reaching a ﬂux of
∼4·105 Hz/cm2. The results are shown in Fig. 4. Note that in
order to keep a high eﬃciency at high particle ﬂuxes, these mea-
surements were done using higher voltages than those optimal
for detecting low-rate muons. The values of ∆VRPWELL were
880 V, 1700 V and 1770 V in Ne/(5%CH4), Ar/(5%CH4) and
Ar/(7%CO2)
respectively. The global detection eﬃciency

approaching rates of ∼105Hz/cm2, due to 30% gain loss (not
shown), possibly resulting from the charging up of the holes
and avalanche build-up limitations on the resistive anode (see
for example [17]). These results are in agreement with that pre-
viously shown in Ne/(5%CH4) [12]. The eﬃciency drop can
be mitigated using higher operation voltage.

To demonstrate the electrical stability of the RPWELL, we
measured the current ﬂowing through the anode using a sensi-
tive ammeter [18], while irradiating the detector with pions at
diﬀerent rates. Fig. 5 shows the current and the pion rates as a
function of time. The measurement shown is in Ar/(7%CO2),
and similar results were obtained in all three gas mixtures. As
expected, the small current spikes, corresponding to the beam
spill-structure, grow smoothly in amplitude with the particle
rate. The measured value of the current should follow the sim-
ple expression: I = q · n · Φ · G(Φ), where I is the current, q is
the electron charge, n is the number of electron-ion pairs pro-
duced by a minimum ionizing particle in 5 mm of Ar [15], Φ is
the particle rate and G the detector gain (which depends on Φ

as explained above). Reversing the formula and using the mea-
sured value of the current, we can estimate the value of G. For
example for Φ=4·103 Hz we get G= 1.3×103, which is com-
patible with the value obtained from the measured charge MPV
(Fig. 2 which is taken at a similar particle rate), once taking into
account the eﬀect of the electronics shaping time.

at diﬀerent rates in Ar/(5%CH4). The beam spill-structure is
clearly visible.

3.3. Gain stability over time

A stable operation of the detector was demonstrated over
time, under 104-105 Hz/cm2 pion ﬂuxes, as shown in Fig. 6.
The applied voltages were the same as those of the measure-
ments presented in section 3.2. No signiﬁcant gain variations
(less than 5%) were observed along ∼1 hour of operation in all
three gas mixtures. The values of global detection eﬃciency
and average pad multiplicity during these measurements also
remained stable.

ﬁciency and pad multiplicity, is superior to that of 1×1 m2
RPCs [17, 19] and 30×30 cm2 GEM detectors [20]; it is simi-
lar to that of 1×1 m2 MICROMEGAS [21, 22]. The eﬃciency
dependence on the incoming particle ﬂux is similar to that of
multi-gap RPCs based on semi-conductive glass [23]. Also in
terms of electrical stability the performance of the RPWELL
detector is similar to that of RPCs. These results pave the way
towards robust, eﬃcient large-scale detectors for applications
requiring economic solutions at moderate spatial and energy
resolutions. A diﬀerent application than digital counting (like
in DHCAL or RICH) could be that of a tracking detector with
strip readout. In this case it would require charge spreading over
a resistive layer to increase the spatial resolution (see for exam-
ple [24]). This detector conﬁguration, as well as the RPWELL
technology scale-up and the investigation of other suitable re-
sistive materials are the subject of current R&D.

3.4. Discharge probability

A discharge was deﬁned as an abrupt increase in the current
supplied to the detector [12]. Discharge probability was mea-
sured during the high-rate pion runs presented in section 3.3.
No discharges were observed in any of the gas mixtures while
irradiating the detector with over 108 pions; therefore the result-
ing value of 10−8 is an upper limit for the discharge probability
in the present RPWELL conﬁguration. Since pions are prone to
induce highly-ionizing secondary events, we have an additional
indication on the broad dynamic range of this detector.

4. Summary and discussion

A 6 mm thick (without readout) 10×10 RPWELL detec-
tor with a Semitron(cid:114) ESD225 resistive plate coupled to
a pad readout anode was investigated for the ﬁrst time in
Ar/(5%CH4) and Ar/(7%CO2) gas mixtures; its performance
was compared with that in Ne/(5%CH4). This thin, single-
stage detector was operated with 150 GeV/c muons and pions,
at ﬂuxes reaching 4·105 Hz/cm2. High detection eﬃciency val-
ues, greater than 98%, at low average pad multiplicity of ∼1.2,
were demonstrated in all three gas mixtures, maintaining stable,
discharge-free operation, also at high pion ﬂux. The eﬃciency
remained unaﬀected up to a pion ﬂux of 104 Hz/cm2, above
which it decreased by a few % at ∼105 Hz/cm2. For example,
the RPWELL maintained a global detection
in Ar/(7%CO2)
eﬃciency of 95% under a ﬂux of 1.5·105 Hz/cm2 pions. The
lack of electrical instabilities over more than 108 pion events
sets an upper limit of 10−8 on the discharge probability - ∼ 2
orders of magnitude better than other THGEM-based conﬁgu-
rations (e.g. single- and double-THGEM, Resistive WELL and
Segmented Resistive WELL reviewed in [7]).
