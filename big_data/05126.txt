CLASSIFICATION OF SPECIAL CURVES IN THE SPACE OF

CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

by

Charles Favre & Thomas Gauthier

Abstract. — We describe all special curves in the parameter space of complex cubic polyno-
mials, that is all algebraic irreducible curves containing inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite
polynomials. This solves in a strong form a conjecture by Baker and DeMarco for cubic
polynomials.

Let Perm(λ) be the algebraic curve consisting of those cubic polynomials that admit an
orbit of period m and multiplier λ. We also prove that an irreducible component of Perm(λ)
is special if and only if λ = 0.

1. Introduction

The space Polyd of complex polynomials of degree d ≥ 2 modulo aﬃne conjugacy forms a
complex analytic space that admits a ramiﬁed parameterization by the aﬃne space Ad−1
C .
The study of the set of degree d polynomials with special dynamical features forms the
core of the modern theory of holomorphic dynamics. We shall be concerned here with
the distribution of the set of post-critically ﬁnite (PCF) polynomials for which all critical
points have a ﬁnite orbit under iteration. This set is a countable union of points deﬁned
over a number ﬁeld, see e.g. [I, Corollary 3]. It was proved in [L] in degree d = 2 that any
sequence of Galois-invariant ﬁnite subsets of PCF polynomials converges in the sense of
measures to the so-called bifurcation measure in Poly2. This was generalized in [FG] in
any degree under a mild assumption and further explored in [GV]. The support of this
measure has been characterized in several ways in a series of works [DF, Du1, Du2, G3],
and it was shown by the second author [G1] to have maximal Hausdorﬀ dimension 2(d−1).
In a beautiful recent paper [BDM], Baker and DeMarco have proposed a way to de-
scribe the distribution of PCF polynomials from the point of view of the Zariski topology.

They deﬁned special algebraic subvarieties as those subvarieties Z ⊂ Polyd admitting a
Zariski-dense subset formed by PCF polynomials, and asked about the classiﬁcation of
such varieties. More precisely, they oﬀered a quite general conjecture [BDM, Conjec-
ture 1.4] inspired by the Andr´e-Oort conjecture in arithmetic geometry stating that any
polynomial(1) lying in a special (proper) subvariety should admit a symmetry (possibly of
degree ≥ 2). They gave a proof of a stronger version of this conjecture in the case the
subvariety was isomorphic to an aﬃne line.
Our objective is to give the list of all special curves in the case d = 3, thereby prov-
ing Baker-DeMarco’s conjecture for cubic polynomials. To do so, following the seminal
work [BH] of Branner and Hubbard, we shall use the parameterization (c, a) 7→ Pc,a of
the parameter space by the aﬃne plane with

Pc,a(z) :=

1
3

z3 −

c
2

z2 + a3, z ∈ C, (c, a) ∈ C2 .

Observe that Pc,a then admits two critical points c0 := 0 and c1 := c and that this map
deﬁnes a ﬁnite branched cover of the moduli space Poly3 of cubic polynomials with marked
critical points.

Here is our main result.

Theorem A. — An irreducible curve C in the space Poly3 is special if and only if one
of the following holds.

(c0) = P k

c,a(c0) or P m+k

c,a

(c1) = P k

c,a

1. One of the two critical points is persistently pre-periodic on C, i.e. there exist integers
c,a(c1) for all

m > 0 and k ≥ 0 such that P m+k
(c, a) ∈ C.
2. There is a persistent collision of the two critical orbits on C, i.e. there exist (m, k) ∈
N2 \ {(1, 1)} such that P m
3. The curve C is given by the equation {(c, a), 12a3 − c3 − 6c = 0}, and coincides with
the set of cubic polynomials having a non-trivial symmetry, i.e. the set of parameters
(c, a) for which Qc(z) := −z + c commutes with Pc,a.

c,a(c0) for all (c, a) ∈ C.

c,a(c1) = P k

Recall that for any integer m ≥ 1 and any complex number λ ∈ C the set Perm(λ)
consisting of all polynomials Pc,a ∈ Poly3 that admits at least one periodic orbit of period
m and multiplier λ is an algebraic curve (see §5 for a more precise description).
The geometry of these curves has been explored by several authors, especially when λ =
0. The irreducible components of Perm(0) has been proven to be smooth by Milnor [Mi3],
and the escape components of these curves have been described in terms of Puiseux series
by Bonifant, Kiwi and Milnor [BKM] (see also [K, §7]). On the other hand, DeMarco
and Schiﬀ [DMS] have given an algorithm to compute its Euler characterisitc.
From the point of view of pluripotential theory, the distribution of the sequence of
curves (Perm(λ))m≥1 has been completely described by Bassanelli and Berteloot in [BB2]
in the case |λ| ≤ 1 (see also [G2] for the case |λ| > 1 and [BB1] for the case of quadratic
rational maps).
Inspired by a similar result from Baker and DeMarco, see [BDM, Theorem 1.1] we also
give a characterization of those Perm(λ) that contain inﬁnitely many PCF polynomials,
and prove

(1)the conjecture is actually stated for any rational maps, and a stronger conjecture related to Pink and
Zilber’s conjectures can be found in [De2].

Theorem B. — For any m ≥ 1, the curve Perm(λ) contains inﬁnitely many post-
critically ﬁnite polynomials if and only if λ = 0.

The general strategy of the proof of these two theorems was set up by Baker and
DeMarco. They start with an irreducible algebraic curve C ⊂ Poly3 containing inﬁnitely
many PCF polynomials (in Theorem B the curve C is a component of some Perm(λ)).
We observe however that they used at several key points their assumption that the curve
C has a single branch at inﬁnity. To remove this restriction we had to include three new
ingredients:

– we construct a one parameter family of heights for which Yuan-Thuillier’s equidis-

tribution theorem applies;

– we investigate systematically the arithmetic properties of the coeﬃcients of the ex-

pansion of the B¨ottcher coordinates and its dependence on the parameters c, a;

– to build the symmetry we rely on a recent algebraization result of Xie [X] that gives
a criterion for when a formal curve in the aﬃne plane is a branch of an algebraic
curve.

A characteristic feature of our proofs is to look at the dynamics induced by cubic polyno-
mials over various ﬁelds: over the complex numbers and over p-adic ﬁelds (see e.g. §4.1),
over the ﬁeld of Laurent series (see the proof of Proposition 3.6 and §5), and over a number
ﬁeld (see §3). We use at one point the universality theorem of McMullen [McM3] which
is a purely Archimedean statement. Moreover the work of Kiwi [K] on non-Archimedean
cubic polynomials over a ﬁeld of residual characteristic zero plays a key role in the proof
of Theorem B.

Let us describe in more detail how we proceed, and so pick an irreducible algebraic curve
C ⊂ Poly3 containing inﬁnitely many PCF polynomials. We may suppose that neither c0
nor c1 are persistently pre-periodic on C. By a theorem of McMullen [McM1, Lemma 2.1]
this is equivalent to say that both critical points exhibit bifurcations at some (possibly
diﬀerent) points in C. There is a more quantitative way to describe the set of bifurcations
3n log max{1,|P n(z)|}. Indeed both functions
using the Green function gc,a(z) := limn→∞
g0(c, a) := gc,a(c0), g1(c, a) := gc,a(c1) are non-negative and pluri-subharmonic, and it is a
fact [De1, §5] that the support of the positive measure ∆g0|C (resp. ∆g1|C) is equal to
the set of parameters where c0 (resp. c1) is unstable.

1

The ﬁrst step consists in proving that g0|C and g1|C are proportional, and this conclusion
is obtained by applying an equidistribution result of points of small height due to Yuan [Y]
and Thuillier [T]. We ﬁrst observe that C is necessarily deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K
since it contains inﬁnitely many PCF polynomials, so that we may introduce the functions
g0,v, g1,v for all (not necessarily Archimedean) places v over K. These functions can now
be used to build a one-parameter family of heights on C by setting

hs(p) :=

max{s0g0,v(q), s1g1,v(q)}

1

deg(p)Xq,v

where s = (s0, s1) ∈ R2
+, and the sum ranges over all Galois conjugates q of p and over all
places v over K. When s0 and s1 are positive integers, then we prove in §3 that the height
hs is induced by a continuous semi-positive adelic metrization in the sense of Zhang on a
suitable line bundle over C of positive degree, so that Yuan-Thuillier’s theorem applies.
This gives us suﬃciently many restrictions on g0 and g1 which force their proportionality.
The key arguments are Proposition 3.6 that is close in spirit to [BDM, Proposition 2.1

4

CHARLES FAVRE & THOMAS GAUTHIER

(3)], and the fact that the function max{g0,v, g1,v} is a proper continuous function on Poly3
for any place v.

From the proportionality of g0 and g1 on a special curve, we are actually able to conclude
the proof of Theorem B. This step is done in §5. We suppose by contradiction that our
special curve C is an irreducible component of some Perm(λ) with λ 6= 0. Then each
branch at inﬁnity of C deﬁnes a cubic polynomial over the complete ﬁeld of Laurent
series C((t)). And we show that except when c0 or c1 is persistently periodic in C the
multipliers of all periodic points are exploding on that branch by [K]. We then analyze
the situation of a unicritical(2) polynomial in C and computing the norm of the multiplier
of its periodic points in a suitable ﬁeld of residual characteristic 3, we are able to get the
required contradiction.

Let us come back to the proof of Theorem A. At this point, we have an irreducible
algebraic curve C deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K and such that g0,v = g1,v at any place
v over K. Recall that for any polynomial Pc,a there exists an analytic isomorphism near
inﬁnity conjugating the polynomial to the cubic monomial map. This isomorphism is
referred to as the B¨ottcher coordinate ϕc,a of Pc,a. We prove that when c, a are deﬁned
over a number ﬁeld then ϕc,a is a power series with coeﬃcients in a number ﬁeld whose
domain of convergence is positive at any place, see Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.3.

Building on an argument of Baker and DeMarco, we then show that outside a compact
subset of the analytiﬁcation of C (for any completion of K) the values of the B¨ottcher
coordinates at c0 and c1 are proportional up to a root of unity (Theorem 4.1 (2)).

The proof now takes a slight twist as we ﬁx any polynomial P := Pc,a that is not
post-critically ﬁnite and for which (c, a) belongs to C(L) for some ﬁnite ﬁeld extension L
of K. We prove that any such polynomial admits a weak form of symmetry in the sense
that there exists an irreducible curve ZP ⊂ P1 × P1 that is stable by the map (P, P ).
The arguments used by Baker and DeMarco in [BDM, §5.6] break down here and we
apply [X, Theorem 1.5] as a replacement for them.
In order to get a polynomial that
commutes with P instead of a correspondence, we proceed as Baker and DeMarco and use
Medvedev-Scanlon’s result [MS, Theorem 6.24] (see [P, Theorem 4.9] for another proof
of this result).

At this point we have proved the following result that we feel is of independent interest.
Theorem C. — Pick any irreducible complex algebraic curve C ⊂ Poly3. Then the fol-
lowing assertions are equivalent:

1. the curve C is special,
2. for any critical point that is not persistenly pre-periodic on C, the set of PCF poly-

nomials lying in C is equal to the set where this critical point is pre-periodic;

3. the curve C is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K and there exist integers (s0, s1) ∈

N2 \ {(0, 0)} such that for any place v ∈ MK, we have

s0 · g0,v = s1 · g1,v ,

on the analytiﬁcation of C over the completion of K w.r.t. the v-adic norm;

4. for any sequence Xk ⊂ C of Galois-invariant ﬁnite sets of PCF polynomials with
Xk 6= Xl for l 6= k, the probability measures µk equidistributed on Xk converge
towards (a multiple of ) the bifurcation measure Tbif ∧ [C] as k → ∞;

(2)i.e. has a single critical point

SPECIAL CURVES FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

5. there exists a root of unity ζ, and integers q, m ≥ 0 such that the polynomial
= ζ, and

2 commutes with any iterate P k

c,a such that ζ 3k

c,a(cj) for some i, j ∈ {0, 1} and all (c, a) ∈ C.

Qc,a(z) := ζP m
Qc,a(P q

c,a(ci)) = P q

c,a(z) + (1 − ζ) c

In (4) the current Tbif is deﬁned as the ddc of the plurisubharmonic function g0 + g1.
Its support in C2 is known to be equal to the set of unstable parameters, see e.g. [DF,
§3]. Notice that for any curve C there exists a critical point which is not persistently pre-
periodic on C since by [BH] the set {g0 = 0} ∩ {g1 = 0} is compact in A2
C. In particular,
the assertion (2) is consistent.

To complete the proof of Theorem A, we analyze in more detail the possibilities for a
cubic polynomial to satisfy the condition (5) in the previous theorem. Namely, we prove
that the set of parameters admitting a non-trivial symmetry of degree 3m > 1 is actually
ﬁnite. Theorems A and C are proved in §7.

We have deliberately chosen to write the entire paper for cubic polynomials only. This
simpliﬁes the exposition but many parts of the proof actually extend to a larger context.
Let us brieﬂy discuss the possible extensions and the limitations of our approach.

All ingredients are present to prove Baker-DeMarco’s conjecture for a curve in the space
of polynomials of any degree d ≥ 2. It is however not clear to the authors how to obtain
the more precise classiﬁcation of special curves in the same vein as in Theorem A.

We note that there are serious diﬃculties that lie beyond the methods presented here
to handle higher dimensional special varieties V in Polyd. The main issue is the following.
To apply Yuan’s equidistribution theorem of points of small heights it is necessary to have
a continuous semi-positive adelic metrics on an ample line bundle on a compactiﬁcation of
V , and we are at the moment very far from being able to check any of the three underlined
conditions.

Trying to understand special curves in the space of quadratic maps requires much more
delicate estimates than in the case of polynomials. A ﬁrst important step has been done
by DeMarco, Wang and Ye in a recent paper [DMWY].

Acknowledgements. — We thank Xavier Buﬀ and Laura DeMarco for discussions at
a preliminary stage of this project.

While ﬁnishing the writing of this paper we have learned that Dragos Ghioca and Hexi
Ye have independently obtained a proof of our Theorem A. Their approach diﬀers from
ours in the sense that they directly prove the continuity of the metrizations induced by the
functions g0,v and g1,v. We get around this problem by considering metrizations induced
by max{s0g0,v, s1g1,v} for positive s0, s1 instead. We warmly thank Ghioca and Ye for
sharing with us their preprint.

2. The B¨ottcher coordinate of a polynomial

In this section, K is any complete metrized ﬁeld of characteristic zero containing a square-
root λ of 1

3 . It may or may not be endowed with a non-Archimedean norm.

If X is an algebraic variety over K, then X an denotes its analytiﬁcation as a real-analytic
or a complex variety if K is Archimedean, and as a Berkovich analytic space when K is
non-Archimedean (see e.g. [B, §3.4-5]).

2.1. Basics
As in the introduction, we denote by Poly3 ≃ A2 the space of cubic polynomials deﬁned
by

(1)

Pc,a(z) :=

1
3

z3 −

c
2

z2 + a3 .

It is a branched cover of the parameter space of cubic polynomials with marked critical
points. The critical points of Pc,a are given by c0 := c and c1 := 0.

For a ﬁxed (c, a) ∈ K 2 the function 1

the sequence 1
gc,a(z) that is called the Green function of Pc,a.

3n log+ |P n

K so that
c,a(z)| converges uniformly to a continuous sub-harmonic function

3 log+ |Pc,a(z)|−log+ |z| is bounded on A1,an

We shall write g0(c, a) := gc,a(c0), g1(c, a) := gc,a(c1), and
G(c, a) := max{g0(c, a), g1(c, a)} .

Proposition 2.1. — There exists a constant C = C(K) > 0 such that

sup
A2,an

K (cid:12)(cid:12)G(c, a) − log+ max{|a|,|c|}(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ C ,

and this constant vanishes when the residual characteristic of K is at least 5.

A proof of this fact is given in [BH, §4] (see also [DF, §6] for a more detailed proof) in

the Archimedean case and in [FG, §2] in general.

2.2. Expansion of the B¨ottcher coordinate

For any cubic polynomial P ∈ K[z], we let the B¨ottcher coordinate of P be the only formal
power series ϕ satisfying the equation

(2)

which is of the form

(3)

ϕ ◦ P (z) = ϕ(z)3
ϕ(z) = λz + α +Xk≥1

akz−k ,

with α, ak ∈ K for all k ≥ 1.
Lemma 2.2. — Given any (c, a) ∈ K × K, the B¨ottcher coordinate ϕc,a(z) of the degree
3 polynomial Pc,a := z3

2 z2 + a3 exists, is unique, and satisﬁes

where

(4)

ak(c, a) ∈ Z(cid:20)λ,

2(cid:21) [c, a] with deg (ak) = k + 1 .

Moreover the 2-adic (resp. 3-adic) norm of the coeﬃcients of ak are bounded from above
by 2k+1 (resp. 3k/2).

Proof. — The deﬁning equation (2) reads as follows:

An immediate check shows that terms in z3 and z2 are identical on both sides of the
equation. Identifying terms in z yields

3λ3(c2/4) + 3λ2a1 = 0, so that a1 = −

whereas identifying constant terms, we get

This shows (4) for k = 1, 2, since λ−1 = 3λ.

in power of z−1. Observe that this coeﬃcient belongs to Z[ 1

easy to complete using again λ−1 = 3λ.

2.3. Extending the B¨ottcher coordinate

Recall that G(c, a) = max{g0(c, a), g1(c, a)}.
Proposition 2.3. — There exists a constant ρ = ρ(K) ≥ 0 such that the B¨ottcher coor-
dinate of Pc,a is converging in {z, log |z| > ρ + G(c, a)}.

8

CHARLES FAVRE & THOMAS GAUTHIER

There exists another constant τ = τ (K) ≥ 0 such that the map (c, a, z) 7→ ϕc,a(z)

extends as an analytic map on the open set

{(c, a, z) ∈ A2,an

K × A1,an

K , gc,a(z) > G(c, a) + τ} ,

and ϕc,a deﬁnes an analytic isomorphism from Uc,a := {gc,a > G(c, a) + τ} to A1,an
K \
D(0, eG(c,a)+τ ) satisfying the equation (2) on Uc,a. We have
gc,a(z) = log |ϕc,a(z)|K on Uc,a .
(5)

Finally, τ = 0 except if the residual characteristic of K is equal to 2 or 3.

We shall use the following lemma which follows easily from e.g. [FG, Proposition 2.3].

Lemma 2.4. — There exists a constant θ = θ(K) ≥ 0

|gc,a(z) − log+ |z|| ≤ θ .

sup
A1,an

K

Moreover, θ is equal to 0 except if the norm on K is Archimedean or the residual charac-
teristic of K is equal to 2 or 3.

1

Proof of Proposition 2.3. — Assume ﬁrst that K is Archimedean, and set τ = 0. In that
case most of the statements are proved in [DH] (see also [BH, §1]). In particular, ϕc,a(z)
is analytic in a neighborhood of ∞ and extends to Uc,a by invariance and deﬁnes an
isomorphism between the claimed domains. It is moreover analytic in c, a, z.
To estimate more precisely the radius of convergence of the power series (3), we rely
on [BH, §4] as formulated in [DF, §6]. First choose C = CK > 0 such that G(c, a) >
log+ max{|a|,|c|} − C. Then log |z| > C + G(c, a) implies |z − c
2| ≥
2 max{1,|a|,|c|} hence log |z − c
2| > G(c, a) − log 2, so that gc,a(z) > log |z − c
2| − log 4 >
G(c, a), and ϕ converges in {z, log |z| > G(c, a) + ρ} with ρ := C as required.

2| > max{1,|a|,|c|} − | c

From now on, we assume that the norm on K is non-Archimedean.
When the residual characteristic of K is diﬀerent from 2 and 3, then (4) implies |ak| ≤
max{1,|c|,|a|}k+1 so that ϕ converges for |z| > max{1,|c|,|a|}, and log |ϕ(z)| = log |z|.
Recall that that we have G(c, a) = log max{1,|c|,|a|} by Proposition 2.1 so that one can
take ρ = 0. Pick any z such that g(z) > G(c, a), and observe that |P n(z)| → ∞. Then we
get

(6)

gc,a(z) = lim
n→∞

1
3n log |P n(z)| = lim

n→∞

1
3n log |ϕ(P n(z))| = log |ϕ(z)| = log |z| .

In particular the set {g > G(c, a)} is equal to A1,an
K \ D(0, eG(c,a)), and ϕ is an analytic
map from that open set onto itself. It is an isomorphism since log |ϕ(z)| = log |z| as soon
as g(z) > G(c, a). The proposition is thus proved in this case with τ = 0.
In residual characteristic 2, |ak| ≤ (2 max{1,|c|,|a|})k+1 whence ϕ converges for |z| >
2 max{1,|c|,|a|}, and as above log |ϕ| = log |z| in that range. Recall that G(c, a) −
log+ max{|c|,|a|} ≥ C = C(K), so that log |z| > G(c, a) + log 2 − CK implies |z| >
2 max{1,|c|,|a|}, which proves that the power series (3) converges for log |z| > G(c, a) + ρ
with ρ = log 2 − C. Set τ := ρ + θ where θ is the constant given by Lemma 2.4. Us-
ing log |ϕ(z)| = log |z| as above, we get that ϕc,a deﬁnes an analytic isomorphism from
Uc,a := {gc,a > G(c, a) + τ} to A1,an
K \ D(0, eG(c,a)+τ ).
|ak| ≤ (31/2 max{1,|c|,|a|})k+1 whence ϕ converges
|z| > 31/2 max{1,|c|,|a|}, and log |ϕ| = log |λz| in that range. Recall that G(c, a) −

In residual characteristic 3,

log+ max{|c|,|a|} ≥ C = C(K), so that log |z| > G(c, a) + log 31/2 − CK im-
plies |z| > 31/2 max{1,|c|,|a|}, which proves that the power series (3) converges for
log |z| > G(c, a) + ρ with ρ = log 31/2 − C. We conclude the proof putting τ := ρ + θ as
before.

Remark. — It is possible to argue that τ = 0 also in residual characteristic 2. Although
we do not know the optimal constant τ in residual characteristic 3 the B¨ottcher coordinate
is likely not to induce an isomorphism from {gc,a > G(c, a)} to A1,an

K \ D(0, eG(c,a)).

3. Curves in Poly3

In this section we ﬁx a number ﬁeld K containing a square-root λ of 1
3 and take an
irreducible curve C in Poly3 that is deﬁned over K. Our aim is to build suitable height
functions on C for which the distribution of points of small height can be described using
Thuillier-Yuan’s theorem. Our main statement is Theorem 3.9 below.

Recall that given any ﬁnite set S of places of K containing all Archimedean places, OK,S
denotes the ring of S-integers in K that is of elements of K of v-norm ≤ 1 for all v /∈ S.
We also write Kv for the completion of K w.r.t. the v-adic norm.

3.1. Adelic series

A formal power seriesPn anzn is said to be adelic on K if its coeﬃcients belong to OK,S
where K is a number ﬁeld, and S a ﬁnite set of places on K; and for each place v on K the
series has a positive radius of convergence rv := lim supn→∞ |an|−1/n
> 0. Observe that
rv = 1 for all but ﬁnitely many places.
Lemma 3.1. — Suppose α(t) = Pn antn is an adelic series with a0 = 0 and a1 6= 0.
Proof. — Suppose an ∈ OK,S for all n, and write β(t) =Pn bntn. The equation β◦α(t) = t

Then there exists an adelic series β such that β ◦ α(t) = t.

for any n ≥ 2 where [·]n denotes the coeﬃcient in tn of the power series inside the brackets.
It follows that bn ∈ OK,S ′ for all n where S′ is the union of S and all places v for which
|a1|v > 1. The convergence of the series follows from Cauchy-Kowalewskaia’s method of
majorant series or from the analytic implicit function theorem, see [C] and [Se, p. 73].
Lemma 3.2. — Pick k ∈ Z, and suppose α(t) = Pn≥k antn is an adelic series with
ak 6= 0. Then there exists an adelic series β such that β(t)k = α(t).

Lemma 3.3. — Pick k ∈ Z, and suppose α(t) = Pn≥k antn is an adelic series with

which shows that β is unique, has coeﬃcients in OL,S ′ where S′ contains S and all places

zk with N ∈ N, bk, ak ∈ OK,S andPk≥1 aktk is an adelic series.

Observe that this is equivalent to assume that α(t−1)−1 is an adelic series.

3.2. Puiseux expansions

We shall need the following facts on the Puiseux parameterizations of a curve deﬁned
over K. These are probably well-known but we include a proof for the convenience of the
reader.
Proposition 3.4. — Suppose P ∈ K[x, y] is a polynomial such that P (0, 0) = 0 and
P (0, y) is not identically zero. Denote by n : ˆD → D := {P = 0} the normalization map,
and pick any branch c ∈ n−1(0) of D at the origin.
Then one can ﬁnd a ﬁnite extension L of K, a ﬁnite set of places S of L, a positive
integer n > 0, and an adelic series β(t) ∈ OL,S[[t]] such that

1. there is an isomorphism of complete local rings dO ˆD,c ≃ L[[t]];
2. the formal map t 7→ (tn, β(t)) parameterizes the branch c in the sense that x(n(t)) =
Proof. — We ﬁrst reduce the situation to the case D is smooth at 0. To do so we blow-up
the origin X1 → A2 and let D1 be the strict transform of D. Since ˆD is normal the map
n lifts to a map n1 : ˆD → D1, and we let p1 be the image of c in D1.
In the coordinates (x, y) = (x′, x′y′) (or (x′y′, y′)) the point p1 has coordinates (0, y1)
where y1 is the solution of a polynomial with values in K hence belongs to an algebraic
extension of this ﬁeld. We may thus choose charts (x, y) = (x′, (x′ +c)y′) (or (x′(y′ +c), x′))
with c ∈ ¯K such that c is now a branch of D1 = {P1 = 0} at the origin, and P1 ∈ ¯K[x′, y′].
We iterate this process of blowing-up to build a sequence of proper birational morphisms
between smooth surfaces Xi+1 → Xi, i = 1, . . . , N until we arrive at the following situation

tn, and y(n(t)) = β(t).

SPECIAL CURVES FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

for X := XN : the strict transform C of D by π : X → A2 is smooth at a point p ∈ π−1(0)
and intersects transversally the exceptional locus of π.
The normalization map n : ˆD → D lifts to a map m : ˆD → C and the image of c by m is
equal to p. Finally there exist coordinates z, w centered at p such that (x, y) = π(z, w) =
(A(z, w), B(z, w)) with A, B ∈ ¯K[z, w], the exceptional locus of π contains {z = 0}, and
C = {R(z, w) := w − za(z) − wQ(z, w) = 0} where a ∈ ¯K[z], Q ∈ ¯K[z, w] and Q(0, 0) = 0.
Fix an algebraic extension L of K and S ﬁnitely many places of L such that A, B, R
have their coeﬃcients in OL,S.
We now look for a power series γ(t) =Pk≥1 γktk such that R(t, γ(t)) = 0. Its coeﬃcients
satisfy the relations

γk = [t2a(t)]k +
k−1Xj=1

γjtj Qt,

k−1Xj=1

γjtjk

which implies that γ exists, is unique, and all its coeﬃcients belongs to OL,S. It follows
from the analytic implicit function theorem, that γ is also analytic as a power series in
Lv[[t]] for any place v.

Let us now consider the two power series (α(t), δ(t)) := π(t, γ(t)). They both belong
to OL,S, are analytic at any place, and we have P (α(t), δ(t)) = 0. Since P (0, y) is not
identically zero, we may write α(t) = tn(a +Pk≥1 αktk) for some n > 0 and a 6= 0.
Replacing L by a suitable ﬁnite extension, and t by a′t for a suitable a′ we may suppose
that a = 1 and αk ∈ OL,S for all k.
By Lemma 3.3, there exists an invertible power series ˆa(t) = t +Pk≥2 aktk that is
analytic at all places with coeﬃcients ak ∈ OL,S and such that α ◦ ˆa(t) = tn. Once this
claim is proved one sets β(t) := δ ◦ ˆa(t), so that π(ˆa(t), γ(ˆa(t))) = (tn, β(t)).
Since m is injective and maps the smooth point c ∈ ˆD to the smooth point p ∈ C, it
induces an isomorphism of complete local rings [OC,p ≃ [O ˆD,c. Observe that the complete
local ring [OC,p = L[[z, w]]/hRi is isomorphic to L[[t]] by sending the class of a formal
series Φ to Φ(t, γ(t))). Composing with the isomorphism of L[[t]] sending t to ˆa(t), we get
an isomorphism [O ˆD,c ≃ L[[t]] such that (x(n(t)), y(n(t))) = π(n(t)) = π(ˆa(t), γ(ˆa(t))) =
(tn, β(t)) as required.

3.3. Branches at inﬁnity of a curve in Poly3
Consider an irreducible aﬃne curve C ⊂ Poly3 deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K. We denote
by Poly3 ≃ P2 the natural completion of Poly3 ≃ A2 using the aﬃne coordinates (c, a).
Let ¯C be the Zariski closure of the curve C in Poly3, and n : ˆC → ¯C be its normalization.
A branch at inﬁnity of C is a point in ˆC lying over ¯C \ C.
Proposition 3.5. — There exists a ﬁnite extension L of K and a ﬁnite set of places S
such that the following holds.

For any branch c of C at inﬁnity there is an isomorphism of complete local rings dO ˆC,c ≃
L[[t]] such that c(n(t)), a(n(t)) are adelic series at inﬁnity.
Proof. — Pick a branch at inﬁnity c of C. Let p∗ be the image of c in Poly3 ≃ P2. It is
given in homogeneous coordinates by p∗ = [c∗ : a∗ : 0] and since C is deﬁned over K we
may assume c∗, a∗ are algebraic over K. To simplify the discussion we shall assume that
c∗ = 1 so that p∗ = [1 : a∗ : 0] (otherwise p∗ = [0 : 1 : 0] and the arguments are completely

analoguous). Let d be the degree of a deﬁning equation P ∈ K[c, a] of C. Observe that
Q(τ, α) := τ dP ( 1
τ − a∗) is a polynomial vanishing at (0, 0) such that Q(0, α) is not
identically zero. Note that {Q = 0} can be identiﬁed to an open Zariski subset of the
completion of {P = 0} in Poly3, and c with a branch of {Q = 0} at the origin.
Apply Proposition 3.4 to this branch c. We get a ﬁnite extension L, a ﬁnite set of
places S of L containing all archimedean ones, a positive integer n, an isomorphism of
complete local ring O ˆC,c ≃ L[[t]], and a power series β ∈ OL,S[[t]] that is analytic at
all places such that α(n(t)) = β(t) and τ (n(t)) = tn. It follows that c(n(t)) = t−n, and
a(n(t)) = t−nβ(t) − a∗ ∈ OL,S[[t]].

3.4. Estimates for the Green functions on a curve in Poly3
In this section, we ﬁx an irreducible curve C in Poly3 and let L be a number ﬁeld for which
the previous proposition applies. Fix a place v of L, and let g0,v(c, a) be the function g0
evaluated at c, a in the completion Lv of L with respect to the v-adic norm.

By [DF] and [FG, Proposition 2.4], the function g0 is the uniform limit on compact
3n log+ |P n
sets of 1
c,a(c0)|. It follows that its lift to the normalization of C is sub-harmonic
(in the classical sense when v is Archimedean and in the sense of Thuillier [T] when v is
non-Archimedean).

To simplify notations, we also write g0,v(t) := g0,v(c(n(t)), a(n(t))) where the adelic

series at inﬁnity c(n(t)) and a(n(t)) are given as above.

Proposition 3.6. — For each branch c of C at inﬁnity, there exists a ﬁnite set of place
S of L such that one of the following two situations occur.

1. For any place v of L, the function g0,v(t) extends as a locally bounded subharmonic

function through c.

2. There exist two constants a(c) ∈ Q∗

+ and b(c) ∈ OL,S such that g0,v(t) =

Remark. — This key result is very similar to [BDM, Proposition 2.1]. Ghioca and He
have proved that g0,v(t) actually extends to a continuous function at t = 0 in case 1. We
also refer to [De2, Proposition 3.1] for a generalization of this result to the case of rational
maps.

valued ﬁeld is complete.

Notation. — We endow the ﬁeld L((t)) with the t-adic norm so that for any Laurent

series Q =P aktk we have |Q|t := e− ordt(Q) with ordt(Q) = min{k, ak 6= 0}. The resulting

In order to avoid confusion, we denote by P(z) ∈ L((t))[z] the cubic polynomial induced
by the family (Pc(n(t)),a(n(t)) )t. Observe that the critical points of P are given by c0 and c1
which correspond to the adelic series at inﬁnity 0 and c(n(t)) respectively.
Proof of Proposition 3.6. — For each q ∈ N∗, we set eq := |Pq(c0)|t, so that either eq is
bounded (i.e. c0 belongs to the ﬁlled-in Julia set of P) or eq → ∞ (exponentially fast).
Suppose we are in the former case, and consider the sequence of subharmonic func-

t (0)|v converges uniformly on
compact subsets in D∗
v to g0,v, hq is uniformly bounded from above on its boundary,
hence everywhere by the maximum principle. It follows from Hartog’s theorem that hq
converges (in L1
loc in the Archimedean case, and pointwise at any non-rigid point in the
non-Archimedean case) to a subharmonic function, hence g0,v is subharmonic on Dv. But
g0,v is non-negative so that (1) holds.

3.5. Adelic semi-positive metrics on curves in Poly3

We ﬁx a number ﬁeld L and ﬁnitely many places S of this ﬁeld that contains all
Archimedean places and all places of residual characteristic 2 and 3. We also assume that
Propositions 3.5, 3.6 and 3.8 are all valid for these choices.

Fix any pair of positive integers s0, s1 ∈ N∗. For each place v, introduce the function

gs,v(c, a) := max{s0 · g0,v(c, a), s1 · g1,v(c, a)} ,

as in the previous section.

Pick a branch at inﬁnity c and choose parameterizations such that Proposition 3.6 is

valid for g0,v and g1,v. Observe that

Gv(t) = max{g0,v(t), g1,v(t)} → ∞

as t → 0 by Proposition 2.1 so that either g0,v or g1,v tends to inﬁnity near t = 0. Since
n0 and n1 are both positive, we conclude to the existence of a(c) ∈ Q∗

such that

gs,v(t) = a(c) log |t|−1

sum is taken over all branches at inﬁnity of C.

We replace the integers s0, s1 by suitable multiples such that the constants a(c) become

integral (for all branch c), and we introduce the divisor D := P a(c) [c] on ˆC where the
Pick a place v, an open subset U ⊂ ˆC an,v and a section σ of the line bundle O ˆC (D)
over U . By deﬁnition σ is a meromorphic function on U whose divisor of poles and zeroes
satisfy div(σ) + D ≥ 0. We set |σ|s,v := |σ|ve−gs,v .

By (11), | · |s,v deﬁnes a continuous metrization on the line bundle O ˆC (D) at any place.
Since gs,v is subharmonic on C v,an, the metrization is semi-positive in the sense of Zhang,
see [CL]. Finally this metrization is adelic thanks to Proposition 3.8 and [FG, §2.3].
We have thus obtained

Observe that the curvature form of this metrization (see [CL]) is given by ∆(gs,v ◦ n).

Theorem 3.9. — Pick any positive integers s0, s1 > 0. Then there exists a positive
integer t ≥ 1, and a non-zero eﬀective and integral divisor D on ˆC such that the collection
of subharmonic functions

gs,v(c, a) := max{ts0 · g0,v(c, a), ts1 · g1,v(c, a)} , (c, a) ∈ C v,an

induces a semi-positive adelic metrization on the line bundle O ˆC(D).
Remark. — The line bundle O ˆC(D) is deﬁned over the same number ﬁeld as C.
Remark. — It is likely that gs,v deﬁnes a semi-positive adelic metrization on an ample
line bundle over a suitable compactiﬁcation of Poly3, but this seems quite delicate to
prove.

4. Green functions on special curves

This section is devoted to the proof of the following result. If K is a number ﬁeld, and v
a place of K, recall the deﬁnition of τv = τ (Kv) from Proposition 2.3, and that τv = 0 if
the residual characteristic of K is larger than 5.

Theorem 4.1. — Let C be an irreducible curve in the space Poly3 of complex cubic poly-
nomials parameterized as in (1). Suppose that C contains inﬁnitely many post-critically
ﬁnite parameters and that neither c0 nor c1 is persistently pre-periodic. Then the following
holds.

1. The curve C is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K and there exist positive integers s0, s1

such that for any place v of K

s0 g0,v(c, a) = s1 g1,v(c, a) for all (c, a) ∈ C v,an .

2. For any branch c of C at inﬁnity, there exists an integer q ≥ 1 and a root of unity ζ

such that for any place v of K, one has

(12)

at c.

A remark is in order about the second assertion of the theorem.

Remark. — We shall prove that for any parameter on the connected component {g0,v >
τv/s0} = {g1,v > τv/s1} in C v,an clustering at c, the two points P q
c,a(c1)
belongs to the domain of deﬁnition of the B¨ottcher coordinate ϕc,a for q large so that (12)
is consistent. We also insist on the fact that (12) holds as an equality of adelic series at
inﬁnity.

Vn,m := {P n0+m0
with n0, n1 ∈ N and m0, m1 ∈ N∗, and each of which is cut out by two polynomial

equations with coeﬃcients in Z(cid:2) 1
set by e.g. [DF, Proposition 6.2], it is a ﬁnite set, hence all its solutions are deﬁned over
a number ﬁeld.

It follows that C is an irreducible curve containing inﬁnitely many algebraic points
(cn, an). Let Q ∈ C[c, a] be a deﬁning equation for C with at least one coeﬃcient equal to
1 and pick σ an element of the Galois group of C over the algebraic closure of Q. Then
Q ◦ σ vanishes also on {(cn, an)} hence everywhere on C, and therefore Q ◦ σ = λQ for
some λ ∈ C∗. Since one coeﬃcient of Q is 1, we get λ = 1 and Q ∈ K[c, a] for a number
ﬁeld K.
Recall that we denote by n : ˆC → ¯C the normalization of the completion ¯C of C in Poly3.
Pick any pair of positive integers s = (s0, s1) and scale them such that apply Theorem 3.9.
This gives us a non-zero eﬀective divisor Ds supported on ˆC \ n−1(C). Replacing s by
a suitable multiple, we may suppose that it is very ample and pick a rational function
φ on ˆC whose whose divisor of poles and zeroes is greater or equal to −Ds. Observe in
particular that φ is a regular function on n−1(C) that vanishes at ﬁnitely many points.

Consider the height hs induced by the semi-positive adelic metrics given by gs,v, see
Theorem 3.9. If (c, a) is a point in n−1(C) that is deﬁned over a ﬁnite extension K, denote
by O(c, a) its orbit under the action of the absolute Galois group of K, and by deg(c, a)
the cardinality of this orbit. Fix a rational function φ as above that is not vanishing at
c, a (this exists since −Ds is very ample). Let MK be the set of places of K. By [CL,
§3.1.3], since φ(c, a) 6= 0 we have

hs(c, a) =

where the last equality follows from the product formula.

We now estimate the total height of the curve ˆC using freely [CL]. Choose any two
meromorphic functions φ0, φ1 such that div(φ0) + Ds and div(φ1) + Ds are both eﬀective
with disjoint support included in n−1(C). Let σ0 and σ1 be the associated sections of

zeroes of σ1. Then

Reversing the order of the two sections, we get hs( ˆC) ≥ 0.
The formula for the height of a closed point implies that for all post-critically ﬁnite
polynomials Pcn,an we have hs(cn, an) = 0. By the arithmetic Hilbert-Samuel theorem
(see [Z, Theorem 5.2]), we get hs( ˆC) = 0 hence we may apply Thuillier-Yuan’s theorem
(see [T, Y]). It follows that the sequence of probability measures µn,v that are equidis-
tributed on O(cn, an) in ˆC v,an converges to a probability measure µ∞,v that is proportional
to ∆gs,v. We may thus write µ∞,v = w(s) ∆gs,v where w(s) ∈ R∗
+ is equal to the inverse
of the mass of ∆gs,v, i.e. to deg(Ds)−1.

We now observe that gs,v is 1-homogeneous in s, and continuous with respect to this
+)2, and µ∞,v = w(s) ∆gs,v for all

parameter. It follows that w(s) is also continuous on (R∗
s ∈ (R∗

+)2.

From now on we ﬁx an Archimedean place v. We shall treat the non-Archimedean
case latter. We work in n−1(C v,an) which is the complement of ﬁnitely many points in
the analytiﬁcation of the smooth projective curve ˆC v,an. To simplify notation we write
g0,v, g1,v instead of g0,v ◦ n, g1,v ◦ n. Recall that by [DF, Theorem 2.5] (see also [McM1,
Theorem 2.2] or [De2, Theorem 1.1]) the equality g0,v = 0 on n−1(C v,an) implies c0 to be

18

CHARLES FAVRE & THOMAS GAUTHIER

persistently pre-periodic. We may thus assume that both c0 and c1 are not persistently
pre-periodic so that g0,v and g1,v are not identically zero on n−1(C v,an).

Recall also that g0,v is harmonic where it is positive and that the support of ∆g0,v is
exactly the boundary of {g0,v = 0} (see e.g. [DF, Proposition 6.7]). In particular ∆g0,v is
a non-zero positive measure, and its mass is ﬁnite by Proposition 3.6. Observe now that
gs,v → g0,v uniformly on compact sets when s tends to (1, 0), hence ∆gs,v → ∆g0,v and
∆g0,v = t0µ∞,v for some positive t0. In the same way, we get ∆gs,v → ∆g1,v as s → (0, 1)
which implies that the three positive measures µ∞,v, ∆g0,v and ∆g1,v are proportional.
We may thus ﬁnd s0, s1 > 0 such that the function Hv := s0g0,v − s1g1,v is harmonic on
n−1(C v,an).

Recall from [McM2] that the bifurcation locus of the family Pc,a parameterized by
(c, a) ∈ n−1(C v,an) is deﬁned as the set where either c0 or c1 is unstable (or active in the
terminology of [DF]). It follows from [DF] that the bifurcation locus is equal to the union
of the support of ∆g0,v and ∆g1,v, hence to the support of µ∞,v.

Suppose now that Hv is not identically zero. Then this support is included in the locus
{Hv = 0} which is real-analytic. This is impossible by McMullen’s universality theorem,
since the Hausdorﬀ dimension of the bifurcation locus of any one-dimensional analytic
family is equal to 2, see [McM3, Corollary 1.6].

We have proved that s0g0,v = s1g1,v on n−1(C v,an) hence on C v,an for some positive real

numbers s0, s1 > 0.

Since g0,v and g1,v are proportional, and Gv = max{g0,v, g1,v} is proper on C v,an, it
follows that g0,v is unbounded near any branch at inﬁnity. By Proposition 3.6, g0,v admits
an expansion of the form g0,v(t) = a(c) log |t|−1 + O(1) with a(c) ∈ Q∗
+ on the branch c
hence is locally superharmonic on that branch.

It follows that ∆g0,v is a signed measure in ˆC an,v whose negative part is a divisor D0
with rational coeﬃcients supported on ˆC \ n−1(C). The same being true for ∆g1,v, we
conclude to the equality of divisors s0D0 = s1D1. This implies that s0/s1 is rational, and
we can assume s0 and s1 to be integers. This ends the proof of the ﬁrst statement in the
case the place is Archimedean.

Assume now that v is non-Archimedean. One cannot copy the proof we gave in the
Archimedean setting since we used arguments that speciﬁcally relied on the Archimedean
assumption at two places.

Instead we apply Proposition 3.6. For each s′ = (s′

0, s′

1) the function gs′,v extends near

some non-positive mass at c. When s′

any branch c at inﬁnity as an upper-semicontinuous function dgs′,v whose Laplacian puts
on O ˆC(Ds) hence ∆dgs′,v{c} = − ordc(Ds) < 0. This mass is in particular independent on

1 6= 0 then gs′,v deﬁnes a positive continuous metric

the place. We get that

0, s′

−∆dg0,v{c} ≥ lim

s→(1,0) −∆dgs,v{c} = ordc(D0) > 0 .

We infer that the mass of ∆g0,v is equal to the degree of D0 hence is non-zero.

We may now argue as in the Archimedean case, and prove that ∆g0,v and ∆g1,v are
proportional. The coeﬃcient of proportionality is the only t > 0 such that D0 = tD1 hence
t = s0/s1. Then Hv := s0g0,v − s1g1,v is harmonic on C and bounded near any branch at
inﬁnity by Proposition 3.6, hence deﬁnes a harmonic function on the compact curve ˆC an,v.
It follows Hv is a constant (in the non-Archimedean case by [T, Proposition 2.3.2]) which
is necessarily zero since it is zero at all post-critically ﬁnite parameters.

We mention here the following result that follows from the previous argument.

Corollary 4.2. — Let C be an irreducible curve in Poly3 deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K
that contains inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite parameters and that neither c0 nor c1 is
persistently pre-periodic. Pick an Archimedean place v.

Pick any sequence Xn ⊂ C( ¯K) of Galois-invariant ﬁnite sets of postcritically ﬁnite
parameters such that Xn 6= Xm for m 6= n. Let µn be the measure equidistributed on
Xn ⊂ C v,an.

Then the sequence µn converges weakly to (a multiple of ) Tbif ∧ [C] as n → ∞.
Recall that Tbif is deﬁned as the ddc of the plurisubharmonic function g0 + g1, and [C]

is the current of integration over the analytic curve C v,an.

Proof. — Let s0, s1 > 0 be given by Theorem 4.1. As seen above, the sequence µn con-
verges weakly towards ddc max{s0 · g0, s1 · g1} = s0 · ddcg0 on C v,an. It thus only remains
to prove that ddc(g0|C v,an) = κ · Tbif ∧ [C] for some κ > 0. Recall that Tbif = ddc(g0 + g1).
By Theorem 4.1, on C,

g0 + g1 = g0 +

s1

s0 · g0 =(cid:18)1 +

s1(cid:19) g0.

. We thus have ddc(g0|C v,an ) = κ−1 · ddc((g0 + g1)|C v,an ). Finally, since

Let κ := 1 + s0
s1
g0 + g1 is continuous, we have Tbif ∧ [C] = ddc((g0 + g1)|C v,an), which ends the proof.
4.2. Values of the B¨ottcher coordinates at critical points are proportional near

inﬁnity

Let us ﬁx a branch at inﬁnity c of an irreducible curve C containing inﬁnitely many
PCF polynomials, and an isomorphism of complete local rings O ˆC,c ≃ L[[t]], such that
c(n(t)) = t−n, and a(n(t)) ∈ OL,S((t)) is an adelic series. Write Pt = Pc(n(t)),a(n(t)) , and
ϕt = ϕPt.
t (c1)

|ζ|v = 1 for all place v over L by (⋆) hence it is a root of unity.

5. Special curves having a periodic orbit with a constant multiplier

In this section, we prove Theorem B.

Pick an integer m ≥ 1 and a complex number λ ∈ C, and consider the set of polynomials
Pc,a that admits a periodic orbits of period m and multiplier λ. It follows from [Si, p. 225]
that this set is an algebraic curve in Poly3 (see also [Mi1, Appendix D], [BB2, Theorem
2.1] or [FG, §6.2]). Let us be more precise:
Theorem 5.1 (Silverman). — For any integer m ≥ 1, there exists a polynomial pn ∈
Q[c, a, λ] with the following properties.
1. For any λ ∈ C \ {1}, pm(c, a, λ) = 0 if and only if Pc,a has a cycle of exact period m
2. When λ = 1, then pm(c, a, 1) = 0 if and only if there exists an integer k dividing m
such that Pc,a has a cycle of exact period k whose multiplier is a primitive m/k-th
root of unity.

and multiplier λ.

We now come to the proof of Theorem B.
One implication is easy. For any integer m ≥ 1, the curve Perm(0) is contained in the
union of the two curves {(c, a) ∈ C2 ; P m
c,a(c1) = c1}.
According to lemma 5.2 below, it contains inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite parameters.
Lemma 5.2. — Pick n ≥ 0, k > 0 and i ∈ {0, 1}. Any irreducible component C of the
set {(c, a), P n+k
c,a(ci)} contains inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite parameters.
Proof. — We argue over the complex numbers, and use the terminology and results
from [DF]. In particular, a critical point ci, i = 0, 1 is said to be active at a parame-
ter (c, a) if the family of analytic functions P n
c,a(ci) is normal in a neighborhood of (c, a).

c,a(c0) = c0} and {(c, a) ∈ C2 ; P m

c,a (ci) = P n

Suppose that C is an irreducible component of the set
c,a(ci)}

{(c, a), P n+k

c,a (ci) = P n

where n ≥ 0, k > 0 and i ∈ {0, 1}. To ﬁx notation we suppose i = 0. Observe that
gc,a(c0) = 0 on C, and since G(c, a) = max{gc,a(c0), gc,a(c1)} is a proper function on Poly3
(see Proposition 2.1) it follows that gc,a(c1) is also proper on C.
In particular, c1 has
an unbounded orbit when c, a ∈ C is close enough to inﬁnity in Poly3. It follows from
e.g. [DF, Theorem 2.5] (which builds on [McM1, Theorem 2.2]) that c1 is active at at
least one point (c0, a0) on C. The arguments of [DF, Lemma 2.3] based on Montel’s

SPECIAL CURVES FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

21

theorem show that (c0, a0) is accumulated by parameters for which c1 is pre-periodic to
a repelling cycle, hence by post-critically ﬁnite polynomials.
In particular, it contains
inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite parameters.

For the converse implication, we proceed by contradiction and suppose that we can ﬁnd
a complex number λ 6= 0, an integer m ≥ 1, and an irreducible component C of Perm(λ)
containing inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite polynomials.
Observe that, whenever 0 < |λ| ≤ 1, any parameter (c, a) ∈ C ⊂ Perm(λ) has a non-
repelling cycle which is not super-attracting.
In particular, at least one of its critical
points has an inﬁnite forward orbit (see e.g.[Mi2]). It follows that Perm(λ) contains no
post-critically ﬁnite parameter when 0 < |λ| ≤ 1. This argument is however not suﬃcient
to conclude in general. But we shall see that a combination of this argument applied at
a place of residual characteristic 3 together with the study of the explosion of multipliers
on a branch at inﬁnity of C gives a contradiction.
Proposition 5.3. — Suppose C is an irreducible component of Perm(λ) with λ ∈ C∗ and
m ≥ 1 containing inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite polynomials. Then one of the two
critical points is persistently periodic on C and λ is equal to the multiplier of a repelling
periodic orbit of a quadratic polynomial whose critical point is periodic.

+ l.o.t (resp. √3

We may thus assume that the curve C is included in Perm(0). Observe that the equation
P m
c,a(c0) = c0 (resp. P m
c,a(c1) = c1) is equivalent to the vanishing of a polynomial of the
form √3
+ l.o.t). It follows that the closure of
C in Poly3 intersects the line at inﬁnity in a set included in {[1 : 0 : 0], [ζ : 1 : 0]} with
ζ 3 = 6 (see also [BB2, Theorem 4.2]).
Consider the curve of unicritical polynomials c0 = c1, which is deﬁned by the equation
c = 0. It intersects the line at inﬁnity at [0 : 1 : 0], so that Bezout’ theorem implies the
existence of one parameter (c, a) ∈ C which is unicritical.
We conjugate Pc,a by a suitable aﬃne map to a polynomial Q(z) = z3 + t. This
unicritical polynomial has a periodic critical orbit. By the previous proposition, it also
has a periodic orbit whose multiplier is equal to the multiplier of a repelling orbit of
a quadratic polynomial having a periodic critical point. The next two lemmas yield a
contradiction, and the proof of Theorem B is complete.

ﬁnite and admits a periodic cycle with a multiplier λ 6= 0.

Then λ belongs to a number ﬁeld K, and we have |λ|v < 1 for any place v of K of

Lemma 5.5. — Suppose λ 6= 0 is equal to the multiplier of a periodic orbit of a quadratic
polynomial having a periodic critical point.
Then λ belongs to a number ﬁeld K, and |λ|v = 1 for any non-Archimedean place v of

K of residual characteristic 6= 2.
Proof of Lemma 5.4. — Since Q is post-critcally ﬁnite, t satisﬁes a polynomial equation
with integral coeﬃcients hence belongs to a number ﬁeld. Its periodic point are solutions
of a polynomial of the form Qn(z)− z so that the periodic points of Q and their multipliers
also belongs to a number ﬁeld.
We may thus ﬁx a number ﬁeld containing t, and λ, and ﬁx a place v of K of residual
characteristic 3. Observe that the completion of its algebraic closure of the completion

ﬁeld isometric to the 3-adic ﬁeld C3. We consider the action of Q on the Berkovich
analytiﬁcation of the aﬃne plane over that ﬁeld. To simplify notation we denote by | · |
the norm on C3.
Suppose that |t| > 1. Then we have |Q(0)| = |t| > 1, and thus |Qn(0)| = |Qn−1(0)|3 =
→ ∞ by an immediate induction. This would imply the critical point to have an
We thus have |t| ≤ 1. This implies that any point having a bounded orbit lies in the
closed unit ball {z,|z| ≤ 1}. Indeed the same induction as before yields |Q(z)| = |z|3 and

Pick any periodic point w of period k with multiplier λ = (Qk)′(w). Observe that

which concludes the proof.

Proof of Lemma 5.5. — Suppose z0 is a periodic point of period k of a quadratic polyno-
mial Pc(z) = z2 + c such that the critical point 0 is periodic of period l.

When 0 is ﬁxed, we have c = 0 and P n

, hence the multiplier of z0 is a power
of 2 (or equal to 0) so that the lemma holds in this case. From now on we assume c 6= 0.
c(0) = 0
hence is an algebraic number. The polynomial P k(z) − z has also algebraic coeﬃcients
hence z0 is algebraic too. Let K be a number ﬁeld containing both z0 and c.

as soon as |zv| < 1. This implies that the orbit of z0 is included in the annulus {|z|v = 1}.

It follows that |z0|v ≤ 1 since otherwise |P n

where the last equality holds when v has residual characteristic 6= 2.
Proof of Proposition 5.3. — Since C contains inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite poly-
nomials we may assume it is deﬁned over a number ﬁeld K. Let ˆC be the normalization of
the completion of C in Poly3. Pick any branch c of C at inﬁnity (i.e. a point in ˆC which
projects to the line at inﬁnity in Poly3). By Proposition 3.5 we may choose an isomor-

phism of complete local rings dO ˆC,c ≃ L[[t]] such that c(n(t)), a(n(t)) are adelic series, i.e.

formal Laurent series with coeﬃcients in OL,S((t)) that are analytic at all places.
In the remaining of the proof, we ﬁx an Archimedean place, and embed L into the ﬁeld
of complex numbers (endowed with its standard norm). We may suppose c(n(t)), a(n(t))
are holomorphic in 0 < |t| < ǫ for some ǫ, and meromorphic at 0. We get a one-parameter

We claim that g0(t) := gPt(c0) tends to inﬁnity when t → 0.

(c(n(t)), a(n(t))) tends to inﬁnity in Poly3 when t → 0, we conclude that g0(t) → ∞.
When c1 is not persistently pre-periodic on C, the two functions g0(t) and g1(t) :=
gPt(c1) are proportional on c by Theorem 4.1 (1). As before max{g0, g1} → ∞ as t → 0
so that again g0(t) → ∞.
By Proposition 3.6, we can ﬁnd a > 0 such that g0(Pt) = a log |t|−1 + O(1).
implies(3) the existence of a constant C > 0 such that
And [DF, Lemma 6.4]
gPt(z) ≤ log max{|z|,|c(n(t))|,|a(n(t))|} + C for all t. Since gPt ◦ Pt = 3gPt , we con-
clude that for all q ≥ 1

log max{|P q

t (c0)|,|c(n(t))|,|a(n(t))|} ≥ 3qgt(0) − C = 3qa log |t|−1 + O(1) .

This implies |P q

t (c0)|t ≥ 3qa|t|t → ∞ when q → ∞ as required.

We continue the proof of Proposition 5.3. Suppose neither c0 nor c1 is persistently
pre-periodic so that the previous lemma applies to both critical points. Translating its
conclusion over the non-Archimedean ﬁeld C((t)), we get that Pq(c0) and Pq(c1) both tend
to inﬁnity when q → ∞. We may thus apply [K, Theorem 1.1 (ii)], and [K, Corollary 1.4]
(which is directly inspired from a result of Bezivin). We conclude that all periodic cycles
of P are repelling so that |(Pm)′(p)|t > 1. This contradicts |λ|t = 1.
Suppose next that c0 is persistently strictly pre-periodic (which implies c1 not to be
persistently pre-periodic). Then c0 is strictly pre-periodic whereas c1 escapes to inﬁnity
by the previous lemma, and we may now apply [K, Theorem 1.1 (iii)(a)] to P. As before
[K, Corollary 1.4] implies that all cycles of P are repelling which gives a contradiction.

We are thus reduced to the case c0 is persistently periodic on C, say of (exact) period
n. We shall prove that λ is equal to the multiplier of a (repelling) periodic orbit of some
complex quadratic polynomial having a periodic critical orbit.

(3)observe that the statement of the lemma is incorrectly stated in [DF], and the constant C is actually
independent on P .

CHARLES FAVRE & THOMAS GAUTHIER

By [K, Theorem 1.1 (iii)(a)], the periodic critical point c0(= 0) is contained in a unique
closed ball B = {z ∈ C((t)), |z|t ≤ r} for some positive r > 0 that is also periodic of some
period m dividing n. Since B is ﬁxed by the polynomial Pn =Pj≥2 bjzj with coeﬃcients
bj ∈ C((t)), the radius r satisﬁes an equation of the form |bj|rj = r for some j hence r = |t|l
for some l ∈ Z. To simplify the discussion to follow we conjugate P by the automorphism
z 7→ t−lz so that B becomes the closed unit ball. Observe that 0 remains a critical point
of P after this conjugacy.
C((t)) for which we have

Recall that the closed unit ball B deﬁnes the Gauss point xg ∈ A1,an

t

|Q(z)(xg)| := sup

z∈B |Q(z)|t = max|qi| for all Q =X qizi ∈ C((t))[z] .

Since B is ﬁxed by Pm, it follows that xg is also ﬁxed by Pm. This is equivalent to say

that Pm can be written as Pm(z) =P3m

i=1 aizi where max |ai| = 1.

For any z ∈ C((t)) of norm 1, denote by ˜z the unique complex number such that

|z − ˜z|t < 1.
Lemma 5.7. — We have a1 = 0, |a0| ≤ |a2| = 1, and |ai| < 1 for all i ≥ 3; and the

complex quadratic polynomial ˜P (z) := ea2z2 + ea0 has a periodic critical orbit.

Lemma 5.8. — The orbit of the periodic point p intersects the ball B.

Replacing p by its image by a suitable iterate of P we may suppose that it belongs to
B, i.e. |p|t ≤ 1. In fact we have |Pi(p)|t = 1 for all i ≥ 0 since any point in the open unit
ball converges to the ﬁxed critical point 0 under Pn. Also the period of p is necessarily a
multiple of m, say mk with k ≥ 1.
Since |a2| = 1, we still have |p|t = 1, and the equality a2 = 1 is now satisﬁed.

To render the computation of the multiplier of p easier, we conjugate Pm by z 7→ a2z.
By Lemma 5.7, we get supB |Q| < 1 with Q := Pm − eP , so that
k−1Yi=0
(Pm)′(Pmi(p)) = (eP k)′(ep) .

But the multiplier of p is equal to λ ∈ C. Hence it is equal to the multiplier of a repelling
periodic orbit of some quadratic polynomial (namely ˜P ) having a periodic critical orbit,
as was to be shown.

(Pmk)′(p) =

Proof of Lemma 5.7. — The point 0 is critical for P hence a1 = 0.

Since the Gauss point is ﬁxed by Pm, we have maxi≥2 |ai| = 1. Let d ≥ 2 be the
maximum over all integers i such that |ai| = 1. The number of critical points of Pn lying
in the closed unit ball (counted with multiplicity) is precisely equal to d− 1. But the exact
period of 0 is n, and no points Pi(0), 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1 can collide with the other critical point
since the latter escapes to inﬁnity. It follows that d = 2, and |a2| = 1 > maxi≥3 |ai|.
Finally 0 is ﬁxed by Pn where n is a multiple of m, hence the complex quadratic
polynomial fP n has a periodic critical orbit of period m/n.

Proof of Lemma 5.8. — Since the multiplier of p is λ ∈ C, its t-adic norm is 1, hence
a small ball U centered at p of positive radius is included in the ﬁlled-in Julia set of P.
By [K, Corollary 4.8], U is eventually mapped into B, hence the claim.

6. A polynomial on a special curve admits a symmetry

We ﬁx K a number ﬁeld, and s0, s1 three positive integers such that s0 and s1 are coprime.
We shall say that a cubic polynomial P := Pc,a with c, a in a ﬁnite extension L of K
satisﬁes the condition (P) if the following holds:
(P1) For any place v of L, we have s0gP,v(c0) = s1gP,v(c1).
(P2) Given any place v of L, if min{gP,v(P n(c0)), gP,v(P n(c1))} > Gv(P ) + τv for some

integer n ≥ 1, then

ϕP,v(P n(c0))s0
ϕP,v(P n(c1))s1

is a root of unity lying in K.

Recall the deﬁnition of the constant τv := τ (Lv) from Proposition 2.3.
Observe that if the condition in (P2) never occurs, then the normalized heights by P of
both sequence of points P n(c0) and P n(c1) are bounded, hence P is post-critically ﬁnite.
We prove here the following

The material of this section is taken from [X]. Let K be a number ﬁeld. For any place v

We cover the line at inﬁnity H∞ of the compactiﬁcation of the aﬃne space A2

K =

K by charts Uα = Spec K[xα, yα] centered at α ∈ H∞(K) such that
α = {(xα, yα) = (0, 0)}, H∞ ∩ Uα = {xα = 0}, and xα = 1/x, yα = y/x + c for some c ∈ K
(or xα = 1/y, yα = x/y).
Fix S a ﬁnite set of places of K. By deﬁnition, an adelic branch s at inﬁnity deﬁned
over the ring OK,S is a formal branch based at a point α ∈ H∞(K) given in coordinates

6.2. Construction of an invariant correspondence

Our aim is to prove the following statement.

Theorem 6.3. — Suppose P = Pc,a is a cubic polynomial satisfying the assumptions (P).
Then there exists a (possibly reducible) algebraic curve ZP ⊂ A1 × A1 such that:

1. φ(ZP ) = ZP with φ(x, y) := (P (x), P (y));
2. for all n large enough, we have (P n(c0), P n(c1)) ∈ ZP ;
3. any branch at inﬁnity of ZP is given by an equation ϕP (x)s0 = ζ · ϕP (y)s1 for some

root of unity ζ ∈ K.

Proof. — The proof is a direct application of Xie’s theorem. Recall that the set UK of
roots of unity that is contained in the number ﬁeld K is ﬁnite.
1

Recall that for each place v over L, we let gP,v := limn

3n log+ |P n|v be the Green

function of P , and write Gv(P ) = max{gP,v(c0), gP,v(c1)}.
Lemma 6.4. — For any ζ ∈ U , there exists an adelic branch cζ based at a point q ∈
H∞(L) such that for any place v the analytic curve Z v(cζ) is deﬁned by the equation
{ϕP,v(x)s0 = ζ · ϕP,v(y)s1} in the range min{|x|v,|y|v} > exp(Gv(P ) + τv).

Deﬁne (xn, yn) := (P n(c0), P n(c1)) ∈ A2(L), and consider the family of all adelic curves
cζ given by Lemma 6.4 for all ζ ∈ UK. We shall ﬁrst check that all hypothesis of Xie’s
theorem are satisﬁed.
To do so pick any integer n and any place v on L. Suppose ﬁrst that gP,v(c0) = 0. Since
gP,v(P n(c0)) = 3ngP,v(c0) = 0, we get |xn|v ≤ eCv =: Bv by Lemma 2.4. The same upper
bound applies to |yn|v since gP,v(c1) = 0 by (P1) so that max{|xn|v,|yn|v} ≤ Bv in this
case.
Suppose now that gP,v(c0) > 0 so that gP,v(c1) > 0 by (P1). Fix N large enough such
that gP,v(P N (c0)) > Gv(P )+τv and gP,v(P N (c1)) > Gv(P )+τv. Then P N (c0) and P N (c1)
lie in the domain of deﬁnition of the B¨ottcher coordinate by Proposition 2.3. Since

gP,v(P n(c0)) = 3n−N gP,v(P N (c0)) ≥ gP,v(P N (c0)) > Gv(P ) ,

we may also evaluate ϕP at xn for all n ≥ N . The same holds for yn and we get

ϕP (xn)s0
ϕP (yn)s1

is a root of unity ζ ∈ K by (P2) hence (xn, yn) belongs to Z v(cζ ) for all n ≥ N .
Xie’s theorem thus applies to the sequence {(xn, yn)}n≥N , and we get an irreducible
curve Z ⊂ A1 × A1 that contains inﬁnitely many points (xn, yn) and such that each of its
branch at inﬁnity is equal to cζ for some ζ ∈ UK.

Recall that φ(x, y) = (P (x), P (y)), and pick any integer n ≥ 1. Then φn(Z) is an
irreducible curve deﬁned over L whose branches at inﬁnity are the images under φn of the
branches at inﬁnity of Z.

Fix ζ ∈ UK and pick (x, y) ∈ Z v(cζ ). Then (x′, y′) = (P (x), P (y)) satisﬁes

ϕP (x′)s0
ϕP (y′)s1

=

ϕP (x)3s0
ϕP (y)3s1

= ζ 3 ,

hence φ(cζ ) = cζ 3. We conclude that any branch at inﬁnity of φn(Z) is of the form cζ
for some ζ ∈ UK. Since two irreducible curves having a branch at inﬁnity in common are
equal, we see that Z is pre-periodic for the morphism φ so that φl+k(Z) = φk(Z) for some
l, k > 0. Setting ZP := ∪l+k−1
j=k φj(Z), we obtain a (possibily reducible) curve deﬁned over
L such that φ(ZP ) = ZP and (xn, yn) ∈ ZP for all n ≥ k. This concludes the proof of the
theorem.

is an adelic series at inﬁnity in the sense of §3.1 , and therefore

too by Lemma 3.1. We may assume that ak, bk ∈ OK,S. Recall from Proposition 2.3 that
ϕP,v induces an analytic isomorphism between {z, gP,v(z) > Gv(P ) + τv} and {z′, |z′|v >
exp(Gv(P ) + τv)}. By Lemma 3.1 the formal map ϕ−1
P deﬁnes an adelic series at inﬁnity
in the terminology of §3.1. For each place v, this series coincides with the inverse map of
ϕP on the complement of the closed disk of radius exp(Gv(P ) + τv) hence its domain of
convergence is exactly {z′, |z′|v > exp(Gv(P ) + τv)}.

It follows that

Zv := {(x, y), ϕP (x)s0 = ζ ϕP (y)s1}
deﬁnes an analytic curve in the domain min{gP,v(x), gP,v(y)} > Gv(P ) + τv, whose image
under the isomorphism (x′, y′) := (ϕP,v(x), ϕP,v(y)) is given by
v := {(x′, y′), (x′)s0 = ζ (y′)s1}
Z ′

where min{|x′|v,|y′|v} > exp(Gv(P ) + τv).
Pick any ξ ∈ ¯Q such that ξs1ζ = 1. Let cζ be the adelic branch at inﬁnity deﬁned by the
formal Laurent series (ϕ−1
P (ξ t−s0)). For any place v, the analytic curve Z v(cζ )
is included in Zv. Since s0 and s1 are coprime, for any pair (x′, y′) with (x′)s0 = ζ (y′)s1
min{s0,s1}(cid:17) such
and min{|x′|v,|y′|v} > exp(Gv(P ) + τv), there exists 0 < |t|v < exp(cid:16)− Gv(P )+τv

that x′ = t−s1 and y′ = ξt−s0.

P (t−s1), ϕ−1

This proves that Z v(cζ ) = Zv for all place as required.

6.3. Invariant correspondences are graphs

Let Z0, . . . , Zp−1 be the irreducible components of ZP such that φ(Zi) = Zi+1 (the index
computed modulo p). Apply [MS, Theorem 6.24] (or [P, Theorem 4.9]) to the component
Z0 of ZP that is φp-invariant. It implies that after exchanging x and y if necessary, the
curve Z0 is the graph of a polynomial map, i.e. Z0 = {(Q(t), t)} for some Q ∈ L[t] such

28

CHARLES FAVRE & THOMAS GAUTHIER

that Q◦ P p = P p ◦ Q. Observe that by [J] the two polynomials P and Q share a common
iterate since we assumed P not to be post-critically ﬁnite.

We now work at an Archimedean place. Recall that the branch at inﬁnity of Z0 is of
the form ϕP (x)s0 = ζϕP (y)s1 for some ζ ∈ UK. Since s0 and s1 are coprime, it follows
that s0 = 1 and s1 = deg(Q), and therefore s1 is a power of 3, say s1 = 3m. We get

ϕP (Q(t)) = ζϕP (t)3m

= ζϕP (P m(t)) .

for all t of large enough norm. By Lemma 2.2, we get that ϕP (t) = λ(cid:0)t − c

2 since a polynomial which tends to 0 at inﬁnity

At this point, recall our assumption that min{gP,v(P q(c0)), gP,v(P q(c1))} > Gv(P ) + τv
for some integer q and some place v of L. Then by (P2) ϕP (P q(c0))s0 = ξϕP (P q(c1))s1,
ϕP (P q+n(c1))3m
for some root of unity ξ ∈ K which implies ϕP (P q+n(c0)) = ξ3n
. Since for
some n large enough the point (P q+n(c0), P q+n(c1)) belongs to Z0, we get ξ3n
= ζ. Now
observe that the least integer n such that ξ3n
= ζ is less that the cardinality of UK. We
get the existence of q′ ≤ C(K, q) such that ϕP (P q′

= ζ. Indeed, since Z0 is φp-invariant and since φ(cζ) = cζ 3, we get
= ζ.

We now pick any integer k ≥ 1 such that ζ 3k

= ζ. Then for all t large enough, we have

7. Classiﬁcation of special curves

In this section, we prove Theorems C and A.

Before starting the proofs, let us introduce some notation. Pick q, m ≥ 0 and ζ a root of
unity. We let Z(q, m, ζ) be the algebraic set of those (c, a) ∈ A2 such that the polynomial
Qc,a := ζP m
= ζ, and
either Qc,a(P q

c,a(c0).

Observe that, when m ≥ 1, Q has degree 3m and when (c, a) belongs to a ﬁxed normed
3nm log+ |Qn| is equal to gc,a. Indeed since Q
ﬁeld K then the Green function gQ := limn
and P k commute they have the same ﬁlled-in Julia set, hence coincide with the ﬁlled-in
Julia set KP of P . And gQ (resp. gP ) is the unique continuous sub-harmonic function
g on A1,an
K that is zero on KP , harmonic outside with a logarithmic growth at inﬁnity
gP (z) = log |z| + O(1) (resp. gQ(z) = log |z| + O(1)). As KP = KQ, this gives gP = gQ.

7.1. Proof of Theorem C

The implication (1) ⇒ (3) is exactly point 1. of Theorem 4.1.

The implication (3) ⇒ (4) follows from Corollary 4.2 when s0 and s1 are both nonzero.
When s1 = 0, then g0,v ≡ 0 on C at all places. By [DF, Theorem 2.5] there exists
n > 0 and k ≥ 0 such that C is an irreducible component of {(c, a) ∈ A2 ; P n+k
c,a (c0) =
P k
c,a(c0)}. By Theorem 3.9 (applied to arbitrary weights) the family of functions {g1,v}v∈MK
induces a semi-positive adelic metric on some ample line bundle on the normalization of
the completion of C so that Thuillier-Yuan’s theorem applies. This gives (4) by observing
that g0 + g1 = g1. The case s0 = 0 is treated similarly.

The implication (4) ⇒ (1) follows from the fact that the positive closed (1, 1) current
Tbif is the ddc of a continuous function (namely g0 +g1) hence the measure Tbif∧[C] cannot
charge any point. Since µk is a sequence of positive measures supported on the set of PCF
polynomials lying in C that converges to Tbif ∧ [C], the curve C is necessarily special.

To prove (2) ⇒ (1), we observe that if c0 is not persistently pre-periodic on C then it
is active at at least one parameter by [DF, Theorem 2.5] and that the set of parameters
for which it is pre-periodic is inﬁnite by e.g. [DF, Lemma 2.3].

We now prove (3) ⇒ (2). We suppose c0 is not persistently pre-periodic on C. Pick
some parameter (c, a) ∈ C and suppose c0 is pre-periodic. We need to show that Pc,a is
post-critically ﬁnite.
Since c0 is not persistently pre-periodic on C we have s1 6= 0 (again by [DF, Theorem
2.5] applied at any Archimedean place). In the case s0 = 0 then c1 is persistently pre-
periodic and Pc,a is clearly post-critically ﬁnite. We may thus assume that s0 and s1 are
both non-zero and the functions g0,v, g1,v vanish on the same set in C v,an for any place v
of K. Observe that c0 being pre-periodic implies (c, a) to be deﬁned over a number ﬁeld.
It follows that for all the Galois-conjugates (c′, a′) of (c, a) (over the deﬁning ﬁeld K of the
curve C) we have Gv(c′, a′) := max{g0,v(c′, a′), g1,v(c′, a′)} = 0. It follows from [I] or [FG,
Theorem 3.2] that Pc,a is post-critically ﬁnite.

Let us now prove (3) ⇒ (5). We suppose C is special. If either c0 or c1 is persistently
pre-periodic in C, the assertion (5) holds true with ζ = 1 and i = j by [DF, Theorem 2.5].
Assume from now on that we are not in this case. Replacing K by a ﬁnite extension
we may assume that all roots of unity ζ appearing in Theorem 6.1 2. belongs to K, since
there are at most the number of branches at inﬁnity of C of such roots of unity.

Let B be the set of all (c, a) ∈ C(L) where L is a ﬁnite extension of K such that Pc,a
is not post-critically ﬁnite. Given a place v of K we also deﬁne the subset Bv of B of
parameters c, a such that g0,v(c, a) > 0. This set is inﬁnite since post-critically ﬁnite
polynomials form a bounded set in C v,an.

Lemma 7.1. — For any (c, a) ∈ B, the polynomial Pc,a satisﬁes (P1) and (P2).

Pick q large enough such that 3q > max{s0/s1, s1/s0}, and ﬁx a place v of residual
characteristic ≥ 5. Now choose any (c, a) ∈ Bv. Then g1,v(c, a) is also positive and
min{gc,a,v(P q(c0)), gc,a,v(P q(c1))} > Gv(c, a) so that Theorem 6.1 applies by the previous
lemma. We get a positive integer q′ (bounded from above by a constant C depending only
on K and q), a root of unity ζ ∈ K and an integer m ≥ 0 such that (c, a) ∈ Z(q′, m, ζ).

Since gQ = gP , and Q(P q′

(c0)) = P q′

(c1) we have

3mgP,v(P q′

(c0)) = gP,v(Q(P q′

(c0))) = gP,v(P q′

. We conclude that the algebraic set consisting of the union of the curves
, q′ ≤ C and ζ ranging over all roots of unity lying in K contains

It follows that C is an irreducible component of one of these curves.
To end the proof of the theorem, we are left with proving (5) ⇒ (3). Suppose that C is
an irreducible component of Z(m, q, ζ) for some m ≥ 0 and q ≥ 0 and some root of unity
ζ. Observe that Z(q, m, ζ) hence C are deﬁned over a number ﬁeld say K.
When m ≥ 1, then for all place v of that number ﬁeld we have gQc,a,v = gPc,a,v for
all (c, a) ∈ C(L) for some ﬁnite extension L of K. In particular Qc,a(P q
c,a(cj )
implies 3mgi,v(c, a) = gj,v(c, a) which proves (3) (with s0 = 0 or s1 = 0 if i = j). When
m = 0 and ζ 6= 1 and C 6= {c = 0}, then Qc,a(c0) = (1 − ζ)c/2 6= 0 hence i 6= j. It follows
that gPc,a,v ◦ Qc,a = gPc,a,v hence g0,v = g1,v. When C = {c = 0}, then c0 = c1 so that
again g0,v = g1,v. Finally when m = 0 and ζ = 1, then i 6= j and P q
c,a(c1) hence
g0,v = g1,v at all places.

c,a(ci)) = P q

c,a(c0) = P q

Proof of Lemma 7.1. — Pick (c, a) ∈ B. By Theorem 4.1 1., Pc,a satisﬁes (P1). To check
(P2), we need to introduce a few sets. Fix any place v of K, and for any integer n ≥ 0,
deﬁne the open subset of C v,an

Ωn,v := {(c′, a′), min{gc′,a′,v(P n

c′,a′(c0)), gc′,a′,v(P n

c′,a′(c1))} > Gv(c′, a′) + τv} .

On Ωn,v one can deﬁne the analytic map

c′,a′(c0))s0
c′,a′(c1))s1
Observe that Ωn+1,v ⊂ Ωn,v, and Mk+l(c′, a′) = Mk(c′, a′)3l
We also deﬁne the increasing sequence of open sets

ϕc′,a′(P n
ϕc′,a′(P n

Mn(c′, a′) :=

.

on Ωk,v for all integers k, l ≥ 0.

Un,v :=(cid:26)(c′, a′), Gv(c′, a′) >

τv

3n − 1(cid:27) ⊂ C v,an .

Since Gv is subharmonic and proper on C v,an, the set Un,v contains no bounded component
by the maximum principle.

Lemma 7.2. — Suppose 3r ≥ max{s0/s1, s1/s0}. Then we have Ωn,v ⊂ Un,v and Un,v ⊂
Ωn+r,v.

By Theorem 4.1 2., one can ﬁnd two integers q ≥ 1 and N ≥ 1 such that Mq is
well-deﬁned and constant equal to a root of unity lying in K in each component of UN,v.
Let V be the connected component of Ωn,v containing (c, a). This open set might or
might not be bounded. By the previous lemma, if n ≥ max{r + N, q}, then Un−r,v ⊂ Ωn,v
so that Mn is well-deﬁned on Un−r,v. Since all components of Un−r,v are unbounded, and
Mn = M 3n−q
in UN,r, we conclude that Mn is locally constant in Un−r,v (hence on V )
equal to a root of unity lying in K.

q

When n ≤ n0 = max{r + N, q}, then (Mn)3n0 −n

= Mn0 which we know is constant in
V equal to a root of unity lying in K. We conclude that Mn is constant on V equal to a
root of unity lying in a ﬁxed extension K′ of K that only depends on the constants r, N
and q. Since these constants are in turn independent of the place v, we conclude the proof
of the lemma replacing K by K′.

SPECIAL CURVES FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

31

Proof of Lemma 7.2. — Pick (c′, a′) ∈ Ωn,v. We may suppose that Gv(c′, a′) = gc′,a′,v(c0)
so that Gv(c′, a′) = gc′,a′,v(c0) = 1
3n (Gv(c′, a′) + τv) which implies
(c′, a′) ∈ Un,v.
gc′,a′,v(c0) so that
gc′,a′,v(P n+r(c0)) ≥ gc′,a′,v(P n(c0)) = 3ngc′,a′,v(c0) =

Conversely suppose (c′, a′) ∈ Un,v. As before we may suppose that Gv(c′, a′) =

c′,a′(c0)) > 1

3n gc′,a′,v(P n

3nGv(c′, a′) = Gv(c′, a′) + (3n − 1)Gv(c′, a′) > Gv(c′, a′) + τv .

Similarly we have

gc′,a′,v(P n+r(c1)) = 3n+r s0
s1

gc′,a′,v(c1) ≥ 3ngc′,a′,v(c0) > Gv(c′, a′) + τv

hence (c′, a′) ∈ Ωn+r,v.

7.2. Proof of Theorem A

According to the implication (1) ⇒ (5) of Theorem C, any irreducible algebraic curve C of
Poly3 containing inﬁnitely many post-critically ﬁnite polynomials is a component of some
Z(q, m, ζ) so that Theorem A reduces to the following.

Proposition 7.3. —

c,a

(c1) = P q

1. The set Z(q, m, 1) is equal to the union {P m+q

(c0) =
P q
c,a(c1)}, hence contains an algebraic curve. Moreover, one has Z(1, 0, 1) =
Z(0, 0, 1).
2. The set Z(q, m,−1) is inﬁnite if and only if m = 0, and we have Z(q, 0,−1) =
{12a3 − c3 − 6c = 0} for any q ≥ 0.
3. if ζ 2 6= 1, the set Z(q, m, ζ) is ﬁnite.
We shall rely on the following observation. Denote by Crit(P ) the set of critical points

c,a(c0)} ∪ {P m+q

c,a

of the polynomial P .

Lemma 7.4. — Pick any (c, a) ∈ Z(q, m, ζ), and suppose that

Qc,a = ζP m

c,a + (1 − ζ)

c
2

is a polynomial that commutes with P k

c,a and ζ is a (3k − 1)-root of unity. Then we have

Qc,a(Crit(P k+m

c,a

)) = Qc,a(Crit(P m

c,a)) ∪ Crit(P k

c,a) .

Proof. — Write P = Pc,a and Q = Qc,a. Diﬀerentiate the equality P k ◦ Q = Q◦ P k. Since
Q′ = ζ · (P m)′, we get

Crit(Q ◦ P k) = P −k(Crit(Q)) ∪ Crit(P k) =

P −k(Crit(P m)) ∪ Crit(P k) = Crit(P k+m) ,

and therefore

Crit(P k+m) = Crit(P k ◦ Q) = Crit(P m) ∪ Q−1(Crit(P k)) ,

and we conclude taking the image of both sides by Q.

We now come to the proof of the Proposition.

32

CHARLES FAVRE & THOMAS GAUTHIER

Proof of Proposition 7.3. — We may and shall assume that all objects are deﬁned over
the ﬁeld of complex numbers.
1. Suppose Z(q, 0, ζ) contains an irreducible curve C. We shall prove that either ζ = ±1,
or C = {c = 0}.
Observe that for any (c, a) ∈ Z(q, 0, ζ), the polynomial Qc,a is an aﬃne map which
commutes with P k
c,a, hence gc,a(Qc,a(z)) = gc,a(z) for all z ∈ C. Without loss of generality,
we may suppose that Qc,a(P q
Suppose that Z(q, 0, ζ) contains an irreducible curve C. If g0 vanishes identically on C
then g1 also, and this implies both critical points to be persistently preperiodic so that
all polynomials in C are post-critically ﬁnite. This cannot happen, so that we can ﬁnd an
open set U in C such that G(c, a) > 0 for all (c, a) ∈ U .
Pick any parameter (c, a) in U . We have Qc,a(Crit(P k
so that Qc,a(c0), Qc,a(c1) ∈ Crit(P k
Crit(P k

c,a(c1), hence G(c, a) = g0(c, a) = g1(c, a).

c,a) by Lemma 7.4,

c,a)) = Crit(P k

c,a(c0)) = P q

c,a). Since

P −j

c,a (Crit(Pc,a))

c,a) = [0≤j≤k−1

we get gc,a(α) = 3−jgc,a(c0) < gc,a(c0) = G(c, a) for any α lying in Crit(P k
c,a) but
not in Crit(Pc,a). However gc,a(Qc,a(c0)) = gc,a(Qc,a(c0)) = G(c, a), therefore we have
Qc,a(c0), Qc,a(c1) ∈ Crit(Pc,a) = {c0, c1}.
required.

This implies either (1 − ζ)c = 0, or (1 + ζ)c = 0, hence ζ = ±1 or C = {c = 0} as

2. Suppose now that C is an irreducible curve included in Z(q, m, ζ) with m > 0. We
claim that either ζ = 1, or C = {c = 0} as above.
We proceed similarly as in the previous case. We suppose that Z(q, m, ζ) is inﬁnite.
For any (c, a) ∈ Z(q, m, ζ), the polynomial Qc,a commutes with P k
c,a for some k, and has
degree 3m > 1. In particular we have equality of Green functions gQc,a = gc,a. Without
loss of generality we may (and shall) assume Qc,a(P q
c,a(c0)) = P q
c,a(c1), which implies
g0(c, a) = 3mg1(c, a).

Assume now by contradiction that ζ 6= 1. Proceeding as in the previous case, we can
ﬁnd an open set U ⊂ C such that G(c, a) = g0(c, a) > 0 for all (c, a) ∈ U . Pick now
(c, a) ∈ U .
Lemma 7.5. — For any α ∈ P −m

c,a {c0}, we have Qc,a(α) ∈ {c0, Qc,a(c1)}.

Observe that

Qc,a(α) = ζP m

c
= (1 − ζ)
2
c,a(c1) + (1− ζ) c
The equality Qc,a(c1) = Qc,a(α) therefore gives Qc,a(c1) = ζP m
and we ﬁnd P m

c,a(c1) = 0 = c0 so that C is a component of Z(1, m, 1).

c,a(α) + (1 − ζ)

= ζc0 + (1 − ζ)

c

c

.

2 = (1− ζ) c
2 ,
2 = 0 so that either ζ = 1, or C equals

The equality c0 = Qc,a(α), implies (1 − ζ) c

{c = 0}.
3. We have Z(q, 0,−1) = Z(0, 0,−1) for all q ≥ 0.
Fix q ≥ 0, and pick any (c, a) ∈ Z(q, 0,−1). Observe that (−1)3 = −1 hence Qc,a(z) =
−z + c commutes with Pc,a by deﬁnition. A direct computation shows that this happens
if and only if (c, a) belongs to the curve D1 := {12a3 − c3 − 6c = 0}.
One can also check that Qc,a(c0) = c1 for any parameter on D1, and this implies
(Qc,a ◦ P q

c,a(c1) for any q ≥ 0. This implies the claim.

c,a(Qc,a(c0)) = P q

c,a)(c0) = P q

SPECIAL CURVES FOR CUBIC POLYNOMIALS

4. The irreducible curve D0 = {c = 0} is included in Z(q, m, ζ) if and only if m = 0 and
ζ = 1.
Observe that any polynomial P := P0,a in D0 is unicritical with a single critical point
at 0, so that D0 is included in Z(q, 0, 1) for all q ≥ 0. Observe also that g0 = g1 > 0 on a
non-empty open subset of D0.
Suppose that D0 is included in Z(q, m, ζ) for some positive integer m > 0. Then the
Green function of Q := Q0,a is equal to gP and the equation Q(P q(c0)) = P q(c1) implies
gP (c0) = 3mgP (c1) > gP (c1) at least when P is close enough to inﬁnity. This is absurd.
Suppose now that D0 is included in Z(q, 0, ζ) with ζ 6= 1 so that Q(z) = ζz. One checks

by induction that for any integer k ≥ 1 one has

P k(z) = qkz3k

+ ska3z3k−3 + l.o.t

with qk, sk ∈ Q∗

+. Choose k minimal such that ζ 3k
Q−1 ◦ P k ◦ Q(z) = qkz3k

+ ska3ζ 3k−4z3k−3 + l.o.t 6= P k

= ζ. We get

which yields a contradiction, and concludes the proof of our claim.

5. We may now prove the proposition. The ﬁrst statement follows from the deﬁnition of
Z(q, m, 1), since in that case we have Q = P m which always commutes with P . Moreover,
the curve Z(1, 0, 1) is given by the equation

0 = Pc,a(c0) − Pc,a(c1) = a3 −(cid:18)a3 −

c3

6(cid:19) = c

c3
6

,

whence Z(1, 0, 1) = {c = 0} = Z(0, 0, 1).
For the second statement, suppose ﬁrst that Z(q, m,−1) is inﬁnite. By the second step,
we have m = 0, or D0 = {c = 0} is included in Z(q, m,−1). The fourth step rules out
the latter possibility so that m = 0. Conversely if m = 0 we may apply the third step to
conclude that Z(q, 0,−1) is a curve equal to D1 = {12a3 − c3 − 6c = 0}.
For the third statement, pick ζ 6= ±1 and suppose by contradiction that Z(q, m, ζ) is
inﬁnite. The ﬁrst and second step imply that Z(q, m, ζ) contains D0 which is impossible
by Step 4.

This concludes the proof of the proposition.

Proof of Lemma 7.5. — Take α ∈ P −m
ing to Lemma 7.4, we have

c,a {c0}, and observe that α ∈ Crit(P k+m

c,a

). Accord-

Qc,a(α) ∈ Crit(P k

c,a) ∪ Qc,a(Crit(P m
c,a))

and gc,a(Qc,a(α)) = 3mgc,a(α) = 3m · 3−mgc,a(c0) = gc,a(c0) = G(c, a) > 0.

nor Qc,a(c1). Then we are in one of the following (excluding) cases:

Pick any point z ∈ Crit(P k
1. z is a preimage of c0 under P j
2. z is a preimage of c1 under P j

c,a) ∪ Qc,a(Crit(P m

c,a for some 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1, and gc,a(z) < gP (c0);
c,a for some 0 ≤ j ≤ k − 1, in which case gc,a(z) ≤
c,a) =

c,a)), so that gc,a(z) = 3mgc,a(w) for some point w ∈ Crit(P m

c,a)), and suppose it is equal to neither c0

gc,a(c1) < gc,a(c0);
3. z ∈ Qc,a(Crit(P m
S0≤j≤m−1 P −j

c,a (Crit(Pc,a)).

In the last case two sub-cases arise. When w is a preimage of c0, we ﬁnd

gc,a(z) = 3mgc,a(w) ≥ 3m 1

3m−1 gc,a(c0) > gc,a(c0) .

34

CHARLES FAVRE & THOMAS GAUTHIER

Otherwise w is a preimage of c1 distinct from c1 since z 6= Qc,a(c1). And we ﬁnd gc,a(z) =
3mgc,a(w) ≤ 3m−1gc,a(c1) < gc,a(c0).

Since gc,a(Qc,a(α)) = gc,a(c0) we conclude that z 6= Qc,a(α) as required.
