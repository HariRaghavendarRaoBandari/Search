Abstract. We present the design of a compact optical clock based on the 2S1/2 →2 D3/2
435.5 nm transition in 171Yb+. The ion trap will be based on a micro-fabricated circuit, with
surface electrodes generating a trapping potential to localize a single Yb ion a few hundred µm
from the electrodes. We present our trap design as well as simulations of the resulting trapping
pseudo-potential. We also present a compact, multi-channel wavelength meter that will permit
the frequency stabilization of the cooling, repumping and clear-out lasers at 369.5 nm, 935.2 nm
and 638.6 nm needed to cool the ion. We use this wavelength meter to characterize and stabilize
the frequency of extended cavity diode lasers at 369.5 nm and 638.6 nm.

1. Introduction
Optical atomic clocks have now surpassed atomic fountain clocks by two orders of magnitude
both in terms of fractional frequency stability and systematic uncertainty [1, 2]. They have
proven to be useful for frequency metrology, for fundamental physics tests [3, 4], and their
resolution make them competitive sensors for relativistic geodesy [5, 6]. While theoretical
proposals point out new ways to further improve their performances [7, 8, 9], and a new deﬁntion
of the SI second by an optical transition is being discussed [10], interest starts to arise for ﬁeld
measurements and transportable atomic clocks [11].

Several proposals for fundamental physics tests using space optical clocks have been written,
and prototypes of such clocks are being developed [12, 13]. Time distribution through GNSS
would beneﬁt both from optical clocks in the satellites and in the ground stations [14].
Additionally, one of the most immediate beneﬁts of a transportable optical clock would be
centimetric resolution for relativistic geodesy surveys [15].

In this perspective, we are currently designing a compact, single-ion atomic clock based
on the 435.5 nm transition in trapped 171Yb+, with a target frequency stability one order of
magnitude below hydrogen masers in a comparable volume, e.g. 10−14τ−1/2 in about 500 L.
Yb+ can be manipulated with diode lasers, and the 435.5 nm transition can easily be adressed
by second-harmonic generation, which can be integrated in a compact optical setup. The clock
will be based on a surface electrodes (SE) trap [16]. SE traps are now widely used in quantum
information processing (QIP) experiments. They allow for a compact physics package, beneﬁt
from high-end microfabrication techniques, and allow for the integration of optical elements [17].

They are known to be hindered by the so-called “anomalous heating” [18], due to the proximity
of the trapping electrodes that can radiate patch potentials [19], but a way to circumvent this
phenomenon using ion-bombardment of the electrodes was recently found [20, 21], making such
traps compatible with a metrological setup.

In this article, we present the general design of the clock, with an emphasis on the SE trap and
the laser frequency stabilization of extended cavity diode lasers using a multi-channel, ﬁbered
wavelength meter.

2. Surface electrode trap ion clock: general principle
2.1. Clock design
We aim to build a compact atomic clock with a total volume of order 500 L, enabled by the
use of a surface electrode ion trap combined with a compact vacuum chamber analogous to
those used in “atom chips” experiments [22]. The trap will close a cubic glass cell connected
to a hybrid ion/getter pump, see a preliminary schematic illustration ﬁgure 1. Such vacuum
chamber designs have been used in compact (< 1 m3) Bose-Einstein condensation setups [23].
The pressure obtained in such setups is in the low 10−10 mbars range, in principle compatible
with Ytterbium ion trapping and cooling. To our knowledge, such “atom chips” cells have never
been tested in ion trapping setups, and we will adapt and test such a design with Yb+ ions.

The cooling and ionization lasers will be stabilized using a compact, multi-channel wavelength
meter (see section 3). The clock laser will be generated by frequency doubling of an extended
cavity diode laser (ECDL) at 871 nm. Second harmonic generation will be obtained with a
ﬁbered non-linear optical waveguide, avoiding the use of a resonant cavity.
It will be pre-
stabilized near the electric quadrupole transition at 435.5 nm using an ultra-stable optical cavity;
we are developping an ultra-compact ULE Fabry-Perot cavity at telecom wavelength, with a
projected total volume of about 54 L for the ultra-stable laser system. We will develop a similar
cavity at 871 nm, in order to reduce the ultra-stable clock laser volume as much as possible.

ment. A surface electrode trap conﬁnes an
Yb+ ion 600 µm below the chip surface. The
chip closes a cubic (1 inch)3 glass cell evac-
uated to ultra-high vacuum. The clock laser
probes the clock transition and is locked to
the atomic signal.

trodes.

2.2. Trap design
In most metrological experiments with ions, 3D designs are used for the trapping electrodes.
Similar trapping potentials can be obtained using surface electrodes traps. The main diﬀerence
comes from the plane shaped electrodes which are all in the same plane and generate the
conﬁnement ﬁeld above the surface of the trap. The pseudo-potential generated by surface
electrodes can be computed analytically [24, 25, 16] and the ﬁeld can be approximated as a
quadrupolar one just near the center of the trap. Due to low electrodes radio-frequency (RF)
breakdown voltages, typically close to 300 V, SE traps are usually weaker than traditional Paul
traps.

Our system is a ﬁve wire RF SE trap illustrated in ﬁgure 2. It consists of two RF electrodes
separated by a DC control electrode and surrounded by two segmented DC electrodes (the “end
caps”). Our two RF electrodes are asymmetric, one of the electrodes being wider than the other
(by a factor of two) in order to rotate the principal axes of the trap compared to the surface.
The resulting tilt is about 8◦ with regard to the chip frame. This will allow us to laser cool all
the motional axes of our ion even when the laser beam is parallel to the electrodes.
We aim to maximise the ion trapping distance from the electrodes, d, as the so-called
“anomalous heating” which aﬀects SE traps scales with d−4 [26]. In order to obtain at least 500
µm between the ion and the surface of the trap, the two RF electrodes are respectively 600 µm
and 1200 µm wide (the distance between the ion and the trap surface is related to the electrodes
width and spacing, see for instance [16]). The central DC control electrode is 600 µm wide, and
the length of these three electrodes is about 5 mm. These dimensions locate the center of the
saddle point at 580 µm above the surface of the trap and rotates the principal radial axes of
motion. At this distance, we can expect a normalized electric ﬁeld noise power spectral density
ωSE(ω) ≈ 4×10−6 V2/m2 [20]. The resulting heating rate for a trapping frequency of 100 kHz
is of order 2200 phonons/s ≈ 20 mK/s. Even though this is rather high, the corresponding
temperature rise during a probe pulse of 50 ms is about 1 mK, corresponding to an additional
second-order Doppler shift of about 3×10−19. Moreover, this heating rate can be reduced by
a factor of up to 100 using surface cleaning by an Ar beam [20], which would make this eﬀect
completely negligible.

We also want a trap depth higher than 200 meV and a radial stability parameter qr < 0.3.
Following simulations of our trap geometry based on [24], we decided to apply an RF voltage
of 250 V at 5.5 MHz. That leads us to a theoretical depth of 222 meV and a radial stability
parameter qr = 0.27. By computing the curvature of the pseudo-potential in the center of
the trap we ﬁnd an oscillating motion frequency of 500 kHz in the radial plane and 97 kHz
along the longitudinal axis. Figure 3 shows ﬁnite-element method (FEM) simulations of the
pseudo-potential.

3. Characterization and wavelength stabilization of extended cavity diode lasers
using a Fizeau wavelength meter
Ultra-violet (UV) laser diodes are still diﬃcult to realize, and only few wavelengths are available
below 400 nm. The 369.52 nm cooling transition in Yb+ is therefore often obtained by frequency
doubling a 740 nm extended cavity diode laser, which can be stabilized to a Fabry Perot transfer
cavity [27], an iodine cell, or a wavelength meter [27, 28]. More recently, diodes emitting directly
around 370 nm near room-temperature have become available, and such diodes can either be
stabilized to Yb+ using a discharge lamp [29], or to a wavelength meter, as demonstrated here.
The transitions involved in 171Yb+ cooling have linewidth γ of order 10 MHz. The integrated
laser frequency ﬂuctuations must be well below γ on the laser-cooling timescale, which is about
a few ten ms. This translates in a fractional frequency stability well below 10−9 at short term
for the wavelengths which are considered here (369.5 nm and 638 nm). For a clock operated on
a daily basis, the lasers should also have negligible drift rates (below 1 MHz/day) to stay on

resonance on the longer term.

3.1. Wavelength meter performance
The wavelength meter we use for laser frequency stabilization is a Standard WS7 wavelength
meter from HighFinesse, with a wavelength measurement range from 350 nm to 1120 nm. An
optional multichannel ﬁber-switch unit can be used to measure up to eight lasers and an optional
proportional integral (PI) regulator can be used to perform a frequency-lock of all these lasers.
We plan to use the 4-channel version of the switch to simultaneously measure and stabilize the
cooling, clear-out and ionization lasers at 369.5 nm, 638 nm and 398 nm. For the measurements
presented here, only one channel is used.

We have characterized the wavelength meter in terms of fractional frequency stability using
the experimental setup described in [30]. We calculated the Allan deviation of the measured
wavelength (771 nm) when using an ultra-stable, frequency-doubled, 1542 nm laser as an input.
The ultra-stable laser exhibits a fractional frequency instability of about 2×10−15 at 1s and a
drift rate of 6 kHz/day [31], far below the wavelength meter instability. The resulting Allan
deviation is therefore the wavelength meter fractional frequency stability. We obtain a fractional
frequency instability of 2×10−10 τ−1/2 from 0.15 s to 10 s and a long-term frequency drift of
3×10−13 τ (about 10 MHz/day) at 771 nm. The resulting relative frequency instability is shown
in ﬁgures 4 and 5, scaled to 369.52 nm and 638.61 nm, assuming that the resolution is the same
at all wavelengths (dashed black line).

3.2. Frequency control with the wavelengthmeter
We have ﬁrst calculated the Allan deviation of a free-running ECDL wavelength at 369.5 nm,
as shown in ﬁgure 4 (pink triangles). The measured fractional frequency stability is below 10−9
for τ between 0.1 and 10 s, which is typical for ECDLs [32]. The red squares show the locked
laser in-loop fractional frequency stability as measured by the wavelength meter when using
the wavelength meter proprietary software. The dashed line indicates the best performance
achievable by the locked laser, assuming that the wavelength meter resolution is the same at
771 nm and 369.52 nm. It is also important to note that the ECDL and the wavelength meter
were not characterized at the same time, nor in the same room, which most probably aﬀects the
results. Assessing the ECDL locked performance would necessitate an independent reading of
its wavelength, which we cannot perform at the moment.

nm locked to the WM using our own digital
PI loop, in-loop signal, outliers removed.

Nevertheless, it is fair to state that the best possible performance achievable by the locked

laser is about 5×10−10 at 1 s, with a 30-fold improvement over its frequency drift.

The ion clock operation will require a complex control system, with inter-dependent
parameters that will need to be optimized. We will use homebuilt digital electronics whenever
possible, both for compacity and for the high degree of control allowed by multiple input-multiple
output (MIMO) control systems. In that spirit, we have developped our own frequency control
loop using the wavelength meter. The wavelength read by the wavelength meter is transferred
via ethernet to a digital PI controller including a digital to analog converter and a FPGA. The
correction signal acts on the piezoelectric transducer of the ECDL. Figure 5 shows preliminary
results obtained when locking the clear-out laser at 638.61 nm. The free-running laser shows
excess noise around τ = 10 s, probably due to temperature ﬂuctuations. Even though this noise
is not fully rejected, the resulting in-loop stability is below 10−9 for τ > 0.5 s. We suspect
that the short-term excess frequency noise stems from communication timing jitter, as the data
transits from the wavemeter server computer to the PI board. Once this problem is solved
and with fully optimized gain parameters, stability below 3×10−10 from 1 to 1000 s should be
achievable.

It is worth noting that the drift rate of about 10 MHz/day only allows autonomous operation
on the day scale. This drift should therefore be compensated either numerically, or by using a
slower servo loop based on the trapped ions ﬂuorescence signal.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have presented the status of our compact Yb+ optical clock project. A testbed
SE trap has been designed. The ion will be trapped at a distance greater than 500 µm in order to
reduce the eﬀect of the so-called anomalous heating. Transverse trapping greater than 500 kHz
will ensure operation in the Lamb-Dicke regime.

The compact clock will of course incorporate a compact optical bench. The cooling lasers

have measured the wavelength meter frequency stability, and used it to characterize and lock the
cooling and clear-out ECDLs at 369.52 nm and 638.61 nm. The performances are compatible
with ion cooling and detection requirements.
