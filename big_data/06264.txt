Abstract

The present article can be considered as a complement to the work P.R.D 93,
045002 (2016) where an nonperturbative approach to QED with x-electric critical
potential steps was developed. In the beginning we study conditions when in- and
out-spaces of the QED under consideration are unitarily equivalent. Then we con-
struct a general density operator with the vacuum initial condition. Such an operator
describes a deformation of the initial vacuum state by x-electric critical potential
steps. We construct reductions of the deformed state to electron and positron sub-
systems, calculating the loss of the information in these reductions. We illustrate the
general consideration studying the deformation of the quantum vacuum between two
capacitor plates. Finally we calculate the entanglement measures of these reduced
matrices as von Neumann entropies.

Introduction

Problems of quantum ﬁeld theory with external ﬁeld violating the vacuum stability are
already being studied systematically for a long time. Recently they turned out to be of
special attention due to new real possible applications in astrophysics and physics of nanos-
tructures. A nonperturbative formulation of QED with the so-called t-potential electric
steps (time-depending potentials) was developed in Refs.
[1, 2, 3] and applied to various
model and realistic physical problems, see e.g. [4, 5, 6]. In the recent work [7] Gavrilov and
Gitman succeeded to construct a consistent version of QED with the so-called x-electric

critical potential steps (time-independent nonuniform electric ﬁelds of constant direction
that are concentrated in restricted space areas), for which a large area of new important
applications opens, see reviews in [7, 8]. However many principle questions of the formula-
tion still require detailed clariﬁcation. The present work is devoted to some of them. In the
beginning we study conditions when in- and out-spaces of the QED under consideration
are unitarily equivalent. Then we construct a general density operator with the vacuum
initial condition. Such an operator describes a deformation of the initial vacuum state by
x-electric critical potential steps. We construct reductions of the deformed state to elec-
tron and positron subsystems, calculating the loss of the information in these reductions.
We illustrate the general consideration studying the deformation of the quantum vacuum
between two capacitor plates. In this article we generally adapt the notations of the paper
[7], where the general theory of QED with x-electric critical potential steps was developed,
and Ref.
[8], where the particular case of a constant electric ﬁeld between two capacitor
plates was studied. In fact, the present article can be considered as a complement to the
work [7].

2 Unitarity in QED with x-electric potential steps

It was shown in Ref.
[7] that in the presence of x-electric potential steps the quantized
Dirac ﬁeld can be described in terms of in and out electrons and positrons. Such particles
are characterized by quantum numbers n that can be divided in ﬁve ranges Ωi, i = 1, ..., 5.
We denote the corresponding quantum numbers by ni, so that ni ∈ Ωi. The manifold of
all the quantum numbers n is denoted by Ω, so that Ω = Ω1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ω5. The in- and
out-vacua can be factorized

|0, ini =

|0, ini(i) ,

|0, outi =

|0, outi(i) ,

(1)

5

Q⊗i=1

Q⊗i=1

where |0, ini(i) and |0, outi(i) are the partial vacua in the ranges Ωi. Note that in each range
Ωi it is also possible to factorize vacuum vectors in modes with ﬁxed quantum number n
so that

|0, ini(i) = Yn∈Ωi

|0, ini(i)
n ,

|0, outi(i) = Yn∈Ωi

|0, outi(i)
n .

(2)

It was shown that all in- and out-vacua, except the vacua in the range Ω3 (in the

so-called Klein zone) coincide,

|0, outi(i) = |0, ini(i) ,

i = 1, 2, 4, 5,

|0, outi(3) 6= |0, ini(3) .

(3)

In what follows, we use the subindex K to denote all the quantities from the Klein

zone, e.g. |0, ini(3) = |0, ini(K), Ω3 = ΩK, and so on.
(3)) with the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude c(K)

The vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude cv = h0, out|0, ini coincides (due to Eq.

in the Klein zone,

v

cv = h0, out|0, ini = c(K)

v = (K)h0, out|0, ini(K) .

(4)

The linear canonical transformation between the in and out sets of creation and annihi-
lation operators in the Klein zone (a and b operators are related to electrons and positrons,

2

respectively) can be written in the following form

where

are relative amplitudes of a pair creation and a pair annihilation, and

wn (−|−)−1 .
All the amplitude can be expressed via the coeﬃcients g(cid:0)ζ(cid:12)(cid:12)

lated via corresponding solutions of the Dirac equation with x-electric potential steps.

An important question is whether in and out spaces are unitarily equivalent? The
answer is positive if the linear canonical transformation (5) (together with its adjoint
transformation) is proper one. In the latter case there exists a unitary operator V , such
that

ζ ′ (cid:1) which, in turn, are calcu-

V (cid:0)a(out), a†(out), b(out), b†(out)(cid:1) V † =(cid:0)a(in), a†(in), b(in), b†(in)(cid:1) ,
|0, ini = V |0, outi , V † = V −1 .

(9)

Let us denote all the out operators via α and all the in operators via β. Then the linear
uniform canonical transformation between these operators can be written as (we consider
the only Fermi case here)

β = Φα + Ψα+, ΦΦ+ + ΨΨ+ = 1, ΦΨT + ΨΦT = 0.

(10)

According to ([10, 11]), transformation (10) is proper one if Ψ is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator,
|Ψmn|2 < ∞. It is easily to see that Hilbert-Schmidt criterion for the transformation

i.e.,Xm,n

(5) reads

where N a
n are diﬀerential mean numbers of electrons and positrons created from
the vacuum by the potential step. Then, the left-hand side of Eq. (11) is the total number
N of particles created from the vacuum, such that unitarity condition can be written as

n + N b

Xn (cid:0)N a

n(cid:1) = N < ∞.

(13)

Note that in- and out-spaces of the scalar QED in the presence of critical potential steps
are unitarily equivalent under the same condition.

For realistic external ﬁeld limited in space and time this condition is obviously satisﬁed.
Inequality (11) derived for QED with x-electric potential steps can be considered as one
more conﬁrmation of the consistency of the latter theory and correct interpretation of in
and out particles there. One should note that qualitatively similar result was established
in Ref. [2] for QED with time-dependent electric potential steps.

3 Deformation of initial vacuum state

In this section we are going to study deformation of initial vacuum state under the action
of a x-electric potential step.

In the Heisenberg picture, the density operator of the system whose initial state is the

vacuum, is given by equation

The in and out Fock spaces are related by the unitary operator V , see (9). Then

ˆρ = |0, inih0, in|.

ˆρ = V |0, outih0, out|V † .

(14)

(15)

In QED with x-electric potential steps the operator V was constructed in [7]. Since it

can be factorized, the density operator (15) can be factorized as well,

V =

ˆρ =

V (i),

|0, ini(i) = V (i)|0, outi(i),

Yi=1
Yi=1
V (i)|0, outi(i) (i)h0, out|V (i)†.

(16)

Due to the speciﬁc structure of the operator V (i), i = 1, 2, 4, 5, we have

V (i)|0, outi(i) (i)h0, out|V (i)† = |0, outi(i) (i)h0, out| = |0, ini(i) (i)h0, in|,

i = 1, 2, 4, 5.

The latter relation has clear physical meaning – vacuum states in the ranges Ω1, Ω2, Ω4,
and Ω5 do not change with time, there is no particle creation there. Let us use the following
notation

P ′ = Yi=1,2,4,5
ˆρK = V (K)PKV (K)†, PK = |0, outi(K) (K)h0, out|,

|0, outi(i) (i)h0, out| = Yi=1,2,4,5

|0, ini(i) (i)h0, in|,

(17)

then

Using the following explicit form of the operator V (K) = V (3) derived in Ref. [7],

ˆρ = P ′ˆρK .

(18)

V (K) = exp"− Xn∈ΩK
× exp"− Xn∈ΩK

one can derive two alternative expressions for the density operator ˆρK.

The ﬁrst one is a normal form exponential with respect to the out-operators (denoted

by : . . . :):

n(out) +bn(out)

ˆρK|cv|−2 = : exp(− Xn∈ΩK(cid:2) +a†

n(out)wn (+ − |0) +b†

+ +a†

Representation (19) can be derived in the following way: Using (17) and the explicit form
of V (K), we can write

n(out) + +bn(out)wn (+ − |0)∗ +an(out)(cid:3)(cid:9) : .

n(out)wn (+ − |0) +b†

Making use of well-known Berezin representation [10] for a projection operator PK on the
vacuum state,

PK = : exp(− Xn∈ΩK(cid:2) +a†

n(out) +an(out) + +b†

(21)

n(out) +bn(out)(cid:3)) :

and taking into account that the left and the right exponents in Eq.
normal ordered, we easily obtain representation (19).

(20) are already

The second representation reads:

ˆρK|cv|−2 = Yn∈ΩK(cid:2)1 − +a†
n(out)wn (+ − |0) +b†
×PK,n(cid:2)1 − +bn(out)wn (+ − |0)∗ +an(out)(cid:3) ,
PK,n = |0, outi(K)
n h0, out|.

(K)

n

n(out)(cid:3)

(22)

Representation (22) can be derived as follows: Using the fact that operators with diﬀerent
quantum numbers n commute, and using the relation, see, e.g., Ref. [4],

exp(cid:2)a†Da(cid:3) = : exp(cid:2)a†(cid:0)eD − 1(cid:1) a(cid:3) : ,

(23)

to transform exponents from V (K), we expand then the obtained expressions in power
series. Since the out-operators in V (K) are Fermi type, these series are reduced to ﬁnite
term expressions. Their actions on the vacuum |0, outi(K) can be easily calculated, and
using of Eq. (2), we arrive at Eq. (22).
Finally we consider the structure of the |0, ini state in terms of out-operators. First of

all we use the fact that the state vector under discussion is factorized,

|0, ini = V |0, outi = |0, ini′|0, ini(K),
|0, ini′ = Yi=1,2,4,5

|0, ini(i),

|0, ini(K) = V (K)|0, outi(K).

Then using the explicit form V (K), we obtain

|0, ini(K) = cv Yn∈ΩK(cid:2)1 − +a†

n(out)wn (+ − |0) +b†

n(out)(cid:3)|0, outi(K).

(24)

(25)

In each ﬁxed mode n ∈ ΩK, the state vector |0, ini is a linear superposition of two terms

– the vacuum vector in this mode and a state with an electron-positron pair.

4 Reductions to electron and positron subsystems

It should be stressed that the system under consideration can be considered as a composed
from a subsystem of electrons and a subsystem of positrons. One can introduce the so-
called two reduced density operators: ˆρ+ of the electron subsystem and ˆρ− of the positron
subsystem, averaging complete density operator (14) over all possible positron states or
over all possible electron states, respectively,

be factorized in quantum modes, as was mentioned already above. One can see that

a = Yn∈Ω1,2

|0, outi(1,2) = |0, outi(1,2)

Using Eq. (18) and representation (22) for ˆρK, it is easy to calculate traces in Eqs.

(26), and to obtain thus explicit forms of the reduced operators ˆρ±:

(29)

We can also consider a reduction of density operator (18), which occur due to mea-
surement of a physical quantity by some classical tool, or, in other words, due to deco-
herence. Suppose that we are measuring the number of particles N(out) in the state ˆρ of
the system under consideration. The operator corresponding to this physical quantity is

ˆN (out) =P5

i=1

ˆNi(out), where

(30)

According to von Neumann [12], the density operator ˆρ after such a measurement is

reduced to the operator ˆρN of a form

ˆρN =Xs

hs, out|ˆρ|s, outi ˆPs,

ˆPs = |s, outihs, out|,

(31)

7

where |s, outi are eigenstates of the operator ˆN (out) with the eigenvalues s that represent
the total number of electrons and positrons in the state |s, outi,

ˆN (out)|s, outi = s|s, outi,
|s, outi = Yn∈Ω1(cid:2) +a†
× Yn∈Ω5(cid:2) +b†
s = Xn∈Ω1
Due to the structure of the operator ˆρ, the weights hs, out|ˆρ|s, outi are nonzero only
for pure states |s, outi with an integer number of pairs in ΩK (since the initial state of the
system was a vacuum, and there is no particle creation outside of the Klein zone). Thus,
the operator ˆρN takes the form

n(out)(cid:3)kn,5 Yn∈ΩK(cid:2) +a†
(ln,2) + Xn∈Ω4

n(out)(cid:3)ln,5(cid:2) −b†
(ln,1 + kn,1) + Xn∈Ω2

Note that ln,i, kn,i = (0, 1), due to the fact that we deal with fermions.

n(out) +b†

n(out)PK,n +bn(out) +an(out)(cid:3) ,

(32)
where operators PK,n and P ′ were deﬁned in the previous Section, see Eq. (22). Note that
the measurement destroys nondiagonal terms of the density operator (22).

Since the operator V is unitary and the initial state of the system under consideration
is a pure state (the vacuum state) the density operator (18) describes a pure state as well.
Therefore its von Neumann entropy is zero. However, the reduced density operators ˆρ±
(29) describe already mixed states and their entropies S(ˆρ±) are not zero,

S(ˆρ±) = −kBtrˆρ± ln ˆρ±.

(33)

It is known that this entropy can be treated as a measure of the quantum entanglement of
the electron and positron subsystems and can be treated as the measure of the information
loss.

Using the normalization condition for the reduced density operators, trˆρ± = 1, the

The diﬀerential mean number of fermions created N cr

n can vary only within the range
(0, 1). The partial entropy Sn for given n in Eq. (36) is symmetric with respect to value
of N cr
n = 0.
This fact can be interpreted as follows.
n = 0 there are no particles
created by the external ﬁeld and the initial vacuum state in the mode remains unchanged.
The case N cr
n = 1 corresponds to the situation when a particle is created with certainty.
The maximum of Sn, corresponding to N cr
n = 1/2, is associated with the state with the
maximum amount of uncertainty.

n = 1/2 and turns to zero at N cr

n = 1 and N cr

In the case of N cr

5 Deformation of the quantum vacuum between two

capacitor plates

Here we illustrate the general consideration considering the deformation of the quantum
vacuum between two inﬁnite capacitor plates separated by a ﬁnite distance L. Some aspects
of particle creation by the constant electric ﬁeld between such plates (this ﬁeld is also called
L-constant electric ﬁeld) were studied in Ref.
[8]. The latter ﬁeld is a particular case of
x-electric potential step. Thus, we consider the L-constant electric ﬁeld in d = D + 1
dimensions. We chose E(x) = (Ei, i = 1, ..., D) , E1 = Ex(x), E2,...,D = 0,

0, x ∈ (−∞,−L/2]
E = const > 0, x ∈ (−L/2, L/2)
0, x ∈ [L/2,∞)

.

The potential energy of an electron in the L-electric ﬁeld under consideration is

Ex(x) =

U(x) =


UL = −eEL/2, x ∈ (−∞,−L/2]
x ∈ (−L/2, L/2)
eEx,
UR = eEL/2,
x ∈ [L/2,∞)

.

(37)

The magnitude of the corresponding x-electric is U = eEL. We are interested in the critical
steps, for which

and the vacuum is unstable in the Klein zone.

We consider a particular case with a suﬃciently large length L between the capacitor

U = eEL > 2m

(38)

plates,

√eEL ≫ max{1, Ec/E} .

(39)

Here Ec = m2/e is the critical Schwinger ﬁeld.
In what follows we conditionally call
this approximation as large work approximation. Such kind of x-electric step represent
a regularization for a constant uniform electric ﬁeld and is suitable for imitating a small-
gradient ﬁeld.

It was shown in Ref. [8] that the main particle production occurs in an inner subrange

˜ΩK of the Klein zone, ˜ΩK ⊂ ΩK,

where K and K⊥ are any given positive numbers satisfying the condition (40).

We recall that, in fact, the quantum numbers n that label electron and positron states in
general formulas gather several quantum numbers,

n = (p0, p⊥, σ) , p⊥ = (p2, . . . , pD) ,

(42)

where for an electron p0 is its energy and for a positron −p0 is its energy, for an electron p⊥
denote its transversal components of the momentum, whereas for a positron −p⊥ denote
its transversal components of the momentum. For an electron σ is its spin polarization
and for a positron −σ is its spin polarization. Note that the electron and positron in a
pair created by an external ﬁeld have the same quantum numbers n.
The quantity (41) is almost constant over the wide range of energy p0 for any given
n ≈ e−πλ. In the limiting case of
the large work approximation, √eEL → ∞, one obtains the well-known result for particle

⊥, for these quantum numbers we can assume N cr

creation by a constant uniform electric ﬁeld N cr

n = e−πλ, see Ref. [14, 15, 16].

In the approximation under the consideration, the total number of particles created

from the vacuum is given by a sum (integral) over n ∈ ˜ΩK,

where J(d) = 2[d/2]−1 is a spin summation factor, V⊥ is the (d − 2)-dimensional spatial
volume in hypersurface orthogonal to the electric ﬁeld direction and T is the time duration
of the electric ﬁeld. The integration over p0 results in

Integrating Eq. (44) over p⊥, we obtain that the total number of created from the vacuum

where V = LV⊥ is the volume inside of the capacitor (the volume occupied by the electric
ﬁeld).

It is obvious that N cr < ∞, when the values V and T are ﬁnite, or, in other words,
when regularization of the ﬁnite volume and ﬁnite time of the ﬁeld action is used. Looking
on the condition (13), we see that the x-electric potential step which represent the electric
ﬁeld inside of the capacitor does not violate the unitarity in QED.

Let us estimate the information loss of the reduced states of the deformed vacuum,
which can be calculated as entropies (36) of these states,. Using the same summation rule
as in (43), one can write

S(ˆρ±) = −kB

As we have mentioned before, the considerable amount of particles is created only in the
subrange ˜ΩK ∈ ΩK, where terms proportional to |ξ1,2|−3 are small and can be neglected,
allowing to use the leading-order approximation N cr
n ≈ e−πλ in the RHS of Eq. (48). Then
we obtain

In the dimensions d > 2 the integration over the transversal components of the momen-
tum can be easily performed. Outside of the subrange ˜ΩK, the integrand is very small, so
that we can extend the integration limits of p⊥ to the inﬁnity. Thus, we ﬁnally get

For example, estimations of this factor for strong ﬁeld Ec/E ≪ 1 and critical ﬁeld Ec/E = 1
with d = 4, 3 are A (4, 0) = π2/6, A (4, 1) ≈ 0, 22; A (3, 0) ≈ 0, 93, A (3, 1) ≈ 0, 20. In the
case of a weak ﬁeld, Ec/E ≫ 1, the entropy is exponentially small for any d,

A (d, Ec/E) ≈ (πEc/E + d/2) exp (−πEc/E) .

One can note, that the large work approximation (50) obtained for S(ˆρ±) in the case
of the x-electric step under consideration coincides with the same approximation for S(ˆρ±)
in the case of the t-electric step with an uniform electric ﬁeld that is acting during a ﬁnite
time interval T (the so called T -constant ﬁeld) obtained in Ref.
[6]. This observation
conﬁrms the fact that the T -constant and L-constant ﬁelds produce equal physical eﬀects
in the large work approximation (or as T → ∞ and L → ∞), such that it is possible to
consider these ﬁelds as regularizations of a constant uniform electric ﬁeld given by two
distinct gauge conditions for electromagnetic potentials. Obviously, exact expressions for
the entropies S(ˆρ±) diﬀer in the general case.
