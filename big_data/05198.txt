We show that universality near a critical end point implies a characteristic relation between third-
and fourth-order baryon susceptibilities χ3 and χ4, resulting in a banana-shaped loop when χ4 is
plotted as a function of χ3 along a freeze-out line. Including the individual enhancements of χ3
and χ4 near a critical point, these features may be a consistent set of observations supporting the
interpretation of baryon ﬂuctuations data as arising from criticality.

Introduction— Determining the existence of a crit-
ical point in the QCD phase diagram would provide in-
valuable information on the behaviour of nuclear mat-
ter at high density, indicating the existence of a ﬁrst
order phase transition line extending to higher density
and lower temperature [1]. Models of chiral symmetry
breaking suggest a critical end point (CEP ) may exist at
high enough temperature and low enough density to be
accessible to heavy-ion collisions at small center-of-mass
energy per nucleon √sN N , motivating the beam energy
scan at RHIC [2–6] and future work at FAIR. Predicting
signals of a critical point in QCD is made challenging by
strong-coupling in analytic theory and the sign-problem
on the lattice. The motivated hypothesis of a critical
point allows us to use the universality of critical phenom-
ena to study the impact of a CEP on some observables.
One universal characteristic of a critical point is diverg-
ing correlation length ξ → ∞, due to the order param-
eter ﬁeld becoming massless. Higher order ﬂuctuation
moments of observables coupled to the order parameter
also diverge, in particular baryon number and transverse
momentum [7, 8]. These susceptibilities can be measured
by event-by-event ﬂuctuations in heavy-ion collision ex-
periments [9]. The approach via universality requires as-
suming the existence of a critical point. It yields robust
qualitative features which are supported by models cal-
culations near the CEP [10–14]. However, it remains a
challenge to predict quantitatively the magnitude of a
signal in heavy ion collisions.

We show that a diverging correlation length implies
a strict ordering of features in the third- and fourth-
order baryon number susceptibilities, which oﬀers a ro-
bust qualitative signature of criticality. Baryon number
is conserved by QCD reactions, and the susceptibilities,
χn = −∂n lnZ/∂µn
B, are derivatives of the logarithm of
the partition function Z with respect to baryon chemical
potential, are robust observables that are measured in

and fourth-order (kurtosis)

are expected to provide stronger signals of criticality be-
cause they diverge with a larger power of ξ than the
second order susceptibility [7]. As indicated, they are
related to each other and the second-order susceptibility
by a µB derivative. For comparison to experimental ob-
servables, volume dependence is eliminated in the ratios

.

(2)

Using the 3D Ising model which is in the same univer-
sality class as QCD, we show that: (a) Universality im-
plies that, along a freeze-out line passing near a critical
end point, third and fourth-order ﬂuctuation moments
are strictly ordered

Tmin,m2 > Tmax,m1 > Tmax,m2 > TCEP .

(3)

(b) Obtaining signatures of criticality does not require
the experiment achieving freeze-out at temperature equal
or lower than TCEP. Scaling may be visible at signif-
icantly higher T , similar to the hypothesized quantum
critical point in the phase diagram of high-Tc supercon-
ductors which is at T = 0 and masked by a supercon-
ducting regime [17]. However, the magnitudes of m1 and
m2 may provide a handle on the distance from the crit-
ical point. This will be demonstrated in the NJL model
with deformed couplings.

Taken together with measurements of χ3 and χ4 which
are expected to exhibit independently particular diver-
gences and functional dependences, this correlation of χ3
and χ4 along a freeze-out line is a consistency check that
would support interpretation of the experimental data as
bona ﬁde signatures of criticality.

Interplay between Skewness and Kurtosis—We
start by studying order parameter ﬂuctuations in the
3D Ising model, which belongs to the same universality
class as QCD. In the Ising model, the general coordi-
nates are (H, t) with H the external magnetic ﬁeld and

t ≡ (T − Tc)/Tc the reduced temperature. The order pa-
rameter, the magnetization M = −∂ lnZ/∂H, is an odd
function of H. M is discontinuous at H = 0 for t < 0.
The CEP is at the origin where the correlation length ξ
diverges. The non-analytic (long-distance) behavior near
the CEP is universal among systems of the same univer-
sality class while the analytic (short-distance) behavior is
model dependent. The non-analytic part of the equation
of state M = M (H, t) near the CEP has the scaling sym-
metry: if M is known for a speciﬁc positive (negative) t,
then M for all positive (negative) t is known.

The susceptibilities are derivatives with respect to H,

κ2 ≡

∂M
∂H

,

κ3 =

∂κ2
∂H

,

κ4 =

∂κ3
∂H

,

(4)

paralleling the relation of χn+1 to χn, each κn+1 is re-
lated to κn by one derivative with respect to the classical
source. We ﬁrst concentrate on susceptibilities at t = 0.2,
obtaining susceptibilities at all t > 0 by the scaling sym-
metry mentioned above. We expect that κ2 = ξ2 is a
decreasing function of |H| since ξ is larger when closer
to the CEP . Also, κ2 is a smooth function of H since
t = 0.2 is in the crossover region. Therefore, κ2 should
have a smooth peak centered at H = 0 and then asymp-
tote to zero as H → ∞ as shown in the upper panel of
Fig. 1, which is computed using the non-analytic part of
the equation of state of Ref. [18].

Once κ2 is obtained, its derivatives yield κ3 and κ4,
also shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1. It is easy to see
that, for H < 0, the peak of κ3 coincides with κ4 = 0
while the peak of κ4 is at larger |H| than the peak of
κ3. Then by scaling symmetry, the peaks of κ3 and κ4
lie on lines A and B, respectively, in the lower panel of
Fig. 1. At constant t < 0, however, κ2−4 are decreasing
functions of |H| with no inﬂection points. The density
plots of κ3(4) is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 with
a H-odd(even) heart-shaped pattern.

In QCD, the story is very similar. We expect the most
singular, non-analytic behavior near the CEP has scaling
symmetry as well. For a constant T > TCEP , χ2 has the
same single peak behavior as κ2 in the Ising model at
t = 0.2 shown in Fig. 1. Then χ3 and χ4 are obtained by
taking derivatives of χ2, similar to analysis of the Ising
model. Therefore, we expect χ3 and χ4 contours in the
scaling region in QCD behave as depicted in the lower
panel of Fig. 2 analogous to what happens in the Ising
model. This feature is rather robust and is conﬁrmed in
model calculations [10–14].

Three Scenarios in Energy Scan Experiments—
the
In experiments, one does not know whether
CEP exists and even if it does, what its location is a pri-
ori. Therefore, the question is, what can one learn from
the susceptibilities measured on the freeze out line? We
discuss three scenarios:
in addition to the two familiar
ones with or without a CEP in the phase diagram, we
will also explore the possibility that a CEP is hidden at
negative T .

Scenario I: CEP at T > 0—In this scenario, con-

κ3 (also κ4 = 0), and Line B the maximum of κ4. The curved

may pass through the scaling region in QCD.

tours of χ3 and χ4 near the CEP are as depicted in
the lower panel of Fig. 2. The location of the CEP is
not known precisely and neither are the contours. The
boundary of χ4 = 0 is determined by the cancellation of
the leading singular structure and can be shifted by sub-
leading, model-dependent, analytic contributions. Our
strategy is to draw a few generic freeze out lines, de-
picted in the lower panels of Fig. 2 and Fig. 1, then ask
whether there are common features of susceptibilities on
those lines. In Fig. 1, we assume that the freeze out line
is a function of t. Going from high to low t, the sim-
plest case is FO1, which crosses lines A and B once each.
The corresponding κ4-κ3 curve is shown in Fig. 3 with
the curve going anti-clockwise forming a “banana” shape
from high to low t. This ﬁgure shows the ordering

the banana shape in m2-m1 is due to the scaling sym-
metry governed by the CEP . But could this connection
so strong such that the banana shape is observable even
if the CEP is at T = 0 or even T < 0? One example
is high-Tc superconductors [17]. It is hypothesized that
there is a quantum critical point at T ≃ 0 that controls
the scaling symmetry at ﬁnite T but is masked by a su-
perconducting regime. If this is also the case in QCD,
then seeing the banana shape in m2-m1 might just sug-
gest the existence of scaling symmetry, which is likely
due to a critical point, even while the critical point is at
T < 0 and hence technically not on the phase diagram.
To study this interesting scenario, we vary the K pa-
rameter that controls the anomaly-induced 6-fermion in-
teraction in the Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model [20]
away from the mostly-used value K0 to reduce TCEP.
We ﬁnd that when K = 0.65K0, TCEP ≃ 0 and when
K = 0.4K0, TCEP eﬀectively becomes negative by extrap-
olation. The phase boundaries for K = 1.0, 0.65, 0.4K0
are shown in the insets in Figures 4, 5 and 6, respectively,
together with the hypothetical freeze out lines which are
obtained by rescaling µB of the phase boundaries by fac-
tors of 0.98, 0.95, 0.915 for the red, green, blue curves,
respectively. We have also plotted the corresponding m2-
m1 plots in Figs. 4-6 which exhibit the following features:
(1) If freeze-out can occur at or below TCEP, all three
features are visible: the minimum in m2, maximum in
m1 and maximum in m2. However, if TCEP is too low to
be reached by the experimental conditions, only a subset
of these features appears in the data. Which subset pro-
vides a rough guide to how far away TCEP is, as well as
an estimation of the upper limit of TCEP.

(2) The magnitude of the susceptibilities also changes
signiﬁcantly with the distance from a critical point. This
is because the dimensionless m1(2) scales with positive
powers of ξ divided by typical scales in the system set by
µB and T , and m2 scales with more powers of ξ than m1.
Therefore when the freeze out line is far away from the
CEP , both m1 and m2 are limited to small values <
∼ 1
and m2 is the same magnitude as m1. Nearer a critical
point, m2 achieves values signiﬁcantly greater than 1.

model. Regions of κi > 0 are in blue and κi < 0 are in red.
The dotted (black) line is the same as Line A in Fig. 1 and dot-
dashed (red) line the same as Line B. Lower panel: A sketch of
the peaks in χ3 and χ4 on a plausible phase diagram of QCD

the location of the maxima in χ3 and χ4 in Fig. 1 suggests how
the freeze-out line may be mapped into the Ising coordinates.

than the critical point temperature. As the ﬂuctuations
become larger closer to the CEP , the closer the freeze
out line to the CEP , the larger and more elongated the
banana is.

In Fig. 1, we also consider a freeze out line FO2 that
crosses line B twice. The corresponding κ4-κ3 plot in Fig.
3 also has the banana shape but has two local maximum
peaks in κ4. Those features remain when one plots m2-
m1 instead of κ4-κ3 since κ2 changes slowly when κ3(4)
changes rapidly.

One can draw other possible freeze out lines, but the
feature of an anti-clock wise loop remains, provided the
line remains in the H < 0 half-plane as is physically
sensible for freeze-out in the hadronic phase. This can
be seen from the fact that at high t, the freeze out line
can start from the regime above line A, between lines A
and B, or below line B, while at low t, it goes below line
B. This implies these freeze out lines at high and low t
will look very similar to FO1 and FO2 in Fig. 3 near the
origin. This is enough to decide the loop is anti-clock
wise which is a feature in common with experiment data
[15, 16, 19].

Scenario II: CEP at “T < 0”—As we argue above,

low as TCEP, seeing that the banana shape is not com-
plete.

There are of course experimental challenges associated
with measuring χ3 and χ4, such as eﬀects from dynamics

FIG. 5. Same as Fig. 4 but with K = 0.65K0. The critical
end point is at TCEP = 0.

This is the reason m1-m2 banana plots become larger and
more elongated for freeze-out lines in closer proximity to
a critical point.

Scenario III: No CEP at all —We expect no ξ en-
hancement for m1(2), and no scaling symmetry associated
with the banana shape in the m2-m1 plot.

Summary—Putting these observations together, we
may formulate rough criteria for evidence of proximity
to a critical point. If m2 achieves maximum >
panied by m1 maximum >
ordering Eq. (3), then freeze-out is occurring near enough
to a critical point for universality to provide the leading
order dynamics.

Preliminary data for m1 and m2 [19] suggest that the
lowest collision energies may be entering the scaling re-
gion, seeing that m2/m1 ∼ 4 ≫ 1, but not reaching as

of the ﬁreball expansion [21] and beam energy-dependent
ﬁnal-state hadron-gas interactions. These eﬀects must be
understood and accounted for in the data as well as pos-
sible to enhance any signal of criticality. Our purpose
has been to argue that, if freeze-out occurs near enough
to a critical point (in the scaling region) for nongaus-
sian ﬂuctuations to be impacted as predicted in preceding
work, then the qualitative relation between the higher-
order ﬂuctuation moments Eq. (3) could hold. This can
serve as a ﬁrst check that the experimentally observed
peaks in m1 and m2 arise from an underlying divergence
of the correlation length in the ﬁreball. We anticipate
that several more such consistent sets of characteristics
should be found in order to prove that the experimental
data do reﬂect the presence of a critical point.
