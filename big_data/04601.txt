Abstract. We consider the quantum centipede made of N fermionic quantum
walkers on the one-dimensional lattice interacting by means of the simplest of all
hard-bound constraints: the distance between two consecutive fermions is either
one or two lattice spacings. This composite quantum walker spreads ballistically,
just as the simple quantum walk. However, because of the interactions between the
internal degrees of freedom, the distribution of its center-of-mass velocity displays
numerous ballistic fronts in the long-time limit, corresponding to singularities
in the empirical velocity distribution. The spectrum of the centipede and the
corresponding group velocities are analyzed by direct means for the ﬁrst few
values of N . Some analytical results are obtained for arbitrary N by exploiting
an exact mapping of the problem onto a free-fermion system. We thus derive the
maximal velocity describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of
the centipede wavefunction, including its non-trivial value in the large-N limit.

1. Introduction

2

Quantum walks [1], the quantum analogues of classical random walks, play a promi-
nent role in quantum information theory [2]. It has been shown in [3] that any quantum
algorithm can be restated in terms of quantum walks. These universal objects
are the source of fascinating problems mixing wave dynamics, discrete geometry
and probability theory. Quantum dynamics often results in a counter-intuitive
phenomenology: quantities like hitting times or survival probabilities of a walker are
genuinely diﬀerent in quantum and classical set-ups; in particular, a quantum search
can be far more eﬃcient than a classical algorithm (see e.g. [4, 5, 6] for reviews).

Single-particle quantum walks have been realized in the laboratory, using nuclear
magnetic resonance [7], trapped ions or atoms [8, 9, 10] and photons [11]. The behavior
of a single quantum walker can be explained by a wave description [12] and reproduced
in an experiment with classical waves [13].

Non-classical eﬀects become essential if one considers multiple quantum walkers.
Quantum walks of correlated photons have been implemented experimentally by
various groups [14, 15, 16, 17]. In such systems, quantum interferences and interactions
lead to entanglement and correlations that can not be accounted for by a classical
picture, triggering thus much interest among theorists [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].

A single quantum walker displays a ballistic rather than a diﬀusive motion.
It spreads over a range of space that grows linearly with time. Surprisingly, the
wavefunction displays sharp maxima near the boundaries of that allowed range,
whereas it is negligibly small beyond this range. These maxima can be interpreted
as ballistic fronts [2, 23]. In a recent work [24], we have investigated the dynamics
of bosonic and fermionic bound states of two interacting continuous-time quantum
walkers in one dimension. The emphasis was on the ballistic spreading of the center-
of-mass coordinate. We have demonstrated the existence of multiple internal ballistic
fronts, corresponding to singularities of the velocity distribution, besides the two usual
extremal ones. This feature is robust and generic, regardless of the statistics and of
the precise form of the interaction potential between the two particles.

The aim of the present work is to investigate the center-of-mass dynamics,
and especially the ballistic fronts, displayed by a composite object made of N
fermionic quantum walkers on a one-dimensional lattice, constrained to remain within
a ﬁxed distance ℓ from their neighbors. This problem can be viewed as quantum-
mechanical version of the diﬀusive dynamics of the N -legged molecular spiders that
were considered in [25], hence the name quantum centipede. In this work we focus our
attention onto the simplest of all centipedes, corresponding to ℓ = 2. In this special
situation, some analytical results can be derived by exploiting an exact mapping of
the problem onto a free-fermion system.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we review known results on
one-dimensional continuous-time quantum walks, both for a single walker and for a
pair of interacting walkers. The fermionic quantum centipede studied in this work
is deﬁned in section 3.
In section 4 we map the problem onto an integrable XX
Heisenberg spin chain, which can be reduced to a free-fermion system and diagonalized
by means of a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Explicit results on the spectrum of the
quantum centipede are presented in section 5 for the ﬁrst few values of the fermion
number (N = 2 to 5). In section 6 we obtain the maximal spreading velocities V (N ) for
arbitrary N , as well as their limit V (∞). Section 7 contains a discussion of our ﬁndings.
A derivation of the characteristic equations (4.14), (4.15) is given in Appendix A.

2. A summary of earlier results on one and two quantum walkers

We consider continuous-time quantum walks on the discrete one-dimensional lattice.
There is no need for an internal degree of freedom (quantum coin), as would be required
for discrete-time dynamics. We recall some elementary results for the single quantum
walk [2, 4, 5, 6, 23], and then discuss the case of two co-walking particles, with an
emphasis on the ballistic fronts (see [24] and the references therein).

2.1. The simple quantum walker

The simple continuous-time quantum walk is modeled by a tight-binding Hamiltonian,
in which the walker hops from a site to a neighboring site. We denote by ψn(t) =
hn|ψ(t)i the wavefunction of the particle at site n at time t, and use dimensionless
units. The dynamics of the walker is given by

i

dψn(t)

dt

= ψn+1(t) + ψn−1(t).

(2.1)

Suppose that the particle is launched from the origin at time t = 0: ψn(0) = δn0.

The wavefunction at time t is then given by a Bessel function:

ψn(t) = i−nJn(2t).

(2.2)

Asymptotic properties of Bessel functions allow us to analyze the spreading of the
quantum walk in the long-time limit [23]. The asymptotic probability distribution of
the eﬀective velocity v = n/t has a compact support and converges to an ‘arc-sine law’:

f (v) =

1

π√4 − v2

(|v| < 2).

(2.3)

We emphasize that, in contrast to the classical case, the convergence is in the weak
sense: the probability distribution |ψn(t)|2 displays high-frequency oscillations which
must be averaged out to derive the function f (v) [26, 27, 28, 29, 30].
At late times, the quantum particle is therefore almost surely located in the
allowed region (|n| < 2t). A more precise analysis shows that the probabilities |ψn(t)|2
display sharp ballistic fronts near the endpoints of the allowed region (n = ±2t), with
a height scaling as t−2/3 and a width scaling as t1/3. The above generic behavior
remains unchanged as long as the initial state is localized in a ﬁnite region: the
quantum walker spreads ballistically in the allowed region limited by ballistic fronts
near n = ±2t, with a forbidden region beyond them. It is however possible to engineer
exceptional initial states, for which either one or even both fronts are eliminated by
quantum interferences [24], but these features are non-generic.

The picture changes qualitatively if the particle is allowed to hop to the next-

nearest neighboring sites with a transition amplitude g:

i

dψn(t)

dt

= ψn+1(t) + ψn−1(t) + g (ψn+2(t) + ψn−2(t)) .

(2.4)

When g > 1/4, the probability distribution of the velocity v = n/t becomes singular
at four values. The quantum walker thus exhibits four fronts: two external fronts (as
above) at v = ±V+, and also two internal fronts at v = ±V− [24]. If longer range
hopping is allowed and if the corresponding hopping amplitudes exceed critical values,
more internal fronts might appear for generic initial conditions.

2.2. Two co-walking quantum particles

The continuous-time quantum walk problem can be generalized by considering several
interacting quantum walkers. In a recent work [24], we have investigated the quantum
walk performed by two identical particles interacting either through hard-bound
constraints or by a smooth conﬁning potential. The statistics of the particles (bosonic
or fermionic) turned out to play an important role in the analysis of the ballistic
spreading of the bound states thus obtained.

We brieﬂy summarize the results of [24] for the quantum walk of two one-
dimensional fermions interacting by the hard-bound constraint that their distance
is at most ℓ lattice spacings. We denote by n1 = n + m and n2 = n the positions
of the particles, so that ncm = n + m/2 is the center-of-mass coordinate, whereas
m = n1 − n2 is the relative coordinate. The hard-bound constraint imposes that
|m| ≤ ℓ. This fermionic system is described by the wavefunction

ψn,m(t) = h(n1, n2)|ψ(t)i = h(n + m, n)|ψ(t)i,

(2.5)

which is odd with respect to m. Because fermionic particles can not cross one another
in one dimension, m can be restricted to the range m = 1, . . . , ℓ. The dynamics is
then given by

i

dψn,m(t)

dt

= ψn,m−1(t) + ψn+1,m−1(t)
+ ψn−1,m+1(t) + ψn,m+1(t),

with Dirichlet boundary conditions: ψn,0(t) = ψn,ℓ+1(t) = 0.

(2.6)

The exact solution of this two-body problem displays the following features. The
wavefunction again spreads ballistically in the center-of-mass coordinate. For late
times, the components ψn,m(t) of the wavefunction have appreciable values for a
range of n that grows ballistically and symmetrically with respect to the origin. The
probability distribution |ψn,m(t)|2 of the bound state in its center-of-mass coordinate
generically exhibits sharp ballistic fronts for n ≈ Vkt, where the front velocities read
(2.7)

(k = 1, . . . , ℓ).

Vk = 2 cos

kπ
ℓ + 1

The spreading dynamics is therefore characterized by two extremal fronts, and ℓ − 2
internal ones for ℓ ≥ 3. The range of the allowed zone is |n| < V t, the maximal
spreading velocity being

V = 2 cos

π

ℓ + 1

.

(2.8)

In the limit where the extent of the bound state diverges (ℓ → ∞), the above result
approaches the free value V = 2, with a 1/ℓ2 correction.
This picture remains qualitatively unchanged if the hard-bound constraint is
replaced by a smooth conﬁning potential. The bosonic and fermionic spectra are
inﬁnite sequences of dispersive energy levels, each of which giving rise to a ballistic
front. These spectra have been studied in detail in the case where the conﬁning
potential is homogeneous, i.e., of the form Wm = g|m|α. In particular, the maximal
spreading velocity of two-fermion bound states departs from its free value V = 2
according to

V ≈ 2 − C(F) g2/(α+3)

at weak coupling (g ≪ 1), where the constant C(F) has been determined [24].

3. The fermionic quantum centipede

It is the quantum centipede
We now introduce the system we study in this work.
made of N interacting fermionic quantum walkers on the one-dimensional lattice.
The interaction is modeled by the simplest of all hard-bound constraints: the distance
between two consecutive fermions is either one or two lattice spacings. Besides the
number N of fermions, the model is entirely parameter-free.

One-dimensional fermions cannot cross each other, and so the discrete positions
of the particles along the chain can be assumed to be ordered as x1 < x2 < . . . < xN .
We label the state of the quantum centipede by the following variables:
• n = x1 denotes the position of the leftmost fermion along the chain,
• the internal state of the centipede is described by a string ε = (ε1, . . . , εN−1) of
N − 1 binary variables, with εj = xj+1 − xj − 1 = 0 or 1 for j = 1, . . . , N − 1.
We have thus εj = 0 if fermions j and j + 1 are adjacent, while εj = 1 if they are
separated by a single empty site.

Figure 1 shows a conﬁguration of 6 fermions and the corresponding string ε.

We have xcm = n + (N − 1)/2 for the most compact internal state (εj = 0 for all j),
whereas xcm = n + N − 1 for the most extended one (εj = 1 for all j).

The 2N−1 amplitudes of N -body wavefunction

n(t) = hx1, x2, . . . , xN|ψ(t)i
ψε

satisfy coupled continuous-time dynamical equations, which are analogous to (2.6). We
shall not need to write down these equations explicitly, except for N = 2 (see (5.1))
and N = 3 (see (5.8)). The system is spatially homogeneous, i.e., invariant under
discrete translations. It is therefore convenient to perform a Fourier transform with
respect to n and deﬁne

bψε(q, t) =Xn

e−iqnψε

n(t),

(3.3)

where the center-of-mass momentum q can be restricted to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone
(|q| ≤ π).
The dynamics of the amplitudes (3.3) is governed by an eﬀective dispersive (i.e.,
q-dependent) Hamiltonian H, represented by a Hermitian matrix of size 2N−1 × 2N−1
(see e.g. (5.2), (5.9), (5.14)). The energy spectrum of the centipede therefore has 2N−1
branches, i.e., the eigenvalues ωa(q) of H, with a = 1, . . . , 2N−1. The corresponding
branches of the group velocity read

va(q) =

dωa(q)

dq

.

(3.4)

Quantum centipedes

We shall be mostly interested in the maximal velocity

V (N ) = max

(3.5)

describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the wavefunction in the
center-of-mass coordinate, as well as in the internal ballistic fronts, characterized by
all the other stationary values of the group velocity, such that

dva(q)

dq

=

d2ωa(q)

dq2 = 0.

(3.6)

In order to proceed, we start by noticing that the action of the quantum
Hamiltonian H can be described in purely classical terms. The string ε is interpreted
as a classical conﬁguration of particles and holes on an open ﬁnite lattice of size N − 1.
If εj = 1, site j is occupied by a particle; if εj = 0, site j is empty. The quantum
dynamics generated by H corresponds to the following evolution rules:

Bulk:
Site 1:

10 ⇀↽ 01 with rate 1.
1 → 0
0 → 1
Site N − 1: 1 → 0
0 → 1

with rate e−iq,
with rate eiq.
with rate 1,

with rate 1.

(3.7)

These rules are reminiscent of the symmetric simple exclusion process (SEP) with
open boundaries (see e.g. [31]). An equivalence with the SEP had already been put
forward in the classical situation of the molecular spiders and centipedes investigated
in [25]. There are however several notable diﬀerences between quantum-mechanical
systems such as the present one and classical stochastic systems such as the SEP:
(i) The quantum Hamiltonian H acts on amplitudes, and not on probabilities.
(ii) The transition amplitudes or ‘rates’ are not necessarily positive real numbers.
(iii) The system is not equivalent to a classical stochastic process, even for q = 0. The
Hamiltonian H and the Markov operator for the SEP have the same non-diagonal
elements, but the Markov operator contains diagonal loss terms, in order to ensure
probability conservation, whereas the Hamiltonian H does not have diagonal entries.

4. Mapping onto a free-fermion system

The energy spectrum of the quantum centipede can be determined, at least formally,
by means of an exact mapping onto an integrable spin chain and ﬁnally onto a free-
fermion system.

The Hamiltonian H that implements the quantum dynamics (3.7) can be written,

using Pauli matrices, as

H = e−iqS+

1 + eiqS−1 +

N−2Xj=1(cid:0)S−j S+

j+1 + S+

j S−j+1(cid:1) + S+

N−1 + S−N−1.(4.1)

We thus obtain the Hamiltonian of an XX spin chain with non-diagonal boundary
terms [32, 33]. By convention, εj = 0 (site j is empty) corresponds to ↑j (spin j is up),
whereas εj = 1 (site j is occupied) corresponds to ↓j (spin j is down). In the local
basis {0j, 1j} ≡ {| ↑ji,| ↓ji}, the Pauli matrices are given by

The Hamiltonian H can be diagonalized by means of a Jordan-Wigner transfor-
mation [34] mapping it onto a free-fermion system. Because of the boundary terms, H
is not fully bilinear. This can be rectiﬁed [35, 36] by adding two auxiliary sites, one
at each end of the chain, labeled 0 and N . We thus deﬁne a new Hamiltonian Hlong
on a chain of N + 1 sites as

1 + eiqSx

(4.4)
The boundary operators Sx
N commute with Hlong. Hence the eigenstates
of Hlong belong to four distinct sectors, corresponding to the eigenvalues (±1,±1) of
the operators Sx
N . The restriction of Hlong to the sector (+1, +1) coincides
with the Hamiltonian H of (4.1).
The Hamiltonian Hlong can be diagonalized using a fermionization procedure, as
explained in [36]. The operators deﬁned as

0 and Sx

(j = 0, . . . , N )

(4.5)

(4.6)
The above anti-commutation relations deﬁne a Cliﬀord algebra. If we rewrite Hlong
in terms of these operators, we obtain

N .

The last step consists in expressing Hlong as a free-fermion Hamiltonian:

(4.7)

(4.8)

Hlong =

Λk(2a†kak − 1).

To do so, we must ﬁnd a set of annihilation and creation operators ak and a†k of
fermionic quasiparticles, satisfying the canonical anti-commutation relations

{ak, a†l} = δkl,

{ak, al} = {a†k, a†l} = 0

(k = 0, . . . , N ).

(4.9)

These quasiparticles are not to be confused with the original fermionic quantum
walkers which constitute the centipede. The number operators Nk = a†kak have
eigenvalues 0 and 1. It follows from (4.8) that the eigenvalues of Hlong are given by

ωlong =

(±Λk),

(4.10)

where the sign ± in front of Λk depends on whether the k-th quasiparticle is present
(Nk = 1) or absent (Nk = 0).

where the bar denotes complex conjugation. The complex coeﬃcients (xk;j , yk;j) are
found by requiring that ak and a†k satisfy the canonical fermionic anti-commutation
relations (4.9) and that Hlong takes the diagonal form (4.8). These constraints are
implemented by writing the commutation relations between Hlong and ak, a†k:

[Hlong, ak] = −2Λkak,

[Hlong, a†k] = 2Λka†k.

Details are given in Appendix A. The quasiparticle eigenvalues are given by

Λk = cos pk,

where the discrete values pk of the internal momentum p satisfy the characteristic
equation (A.13), which can be further simpliﬁed by dealing separately with even and
odd values of N . We obtain after some algebra

N even:

N odd:

sin((N + 1)p) − 3 sin((N − 1)p) = ±4 sin p sin q,
sin((N + 1)p) − 3 sin((N − 1)p) = ±4 sin p cos q.

5. Explicit results for the ﬁrst few values of N

In this section we present explicit results for the ﬁrst few values of the fermion number
(N = 2 to 5).

• N = 2
This is a special case of the more general two-body problem considered in [24], where
the maximal distance between the two quantum walkers is an arbitrary integer ℓ.

and consequently no internal front besides the extremal ones, in agreement with the
ﬁndings of [24] for ℓ = 2, recalled in section 2.2. Figure 2 shows plots of the energy
spectrum (left) and of the group velocities (right) against q/π in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.

The above results illustrate the general feature that the complexity of the energy
spectrum of the centipede grows very fast as the fermion number N is increased. In
particular the number of stationary values of the velocity satisfying (3.6), which are
responsible for the occurrence of internal ballistic fronts, grows very rapidly with N .
The quasiparticle spectrum however remains regular and simple, as the number of
quasiparticle eigenvalues only grows linearly with N .

6. Maximal spreading velocity for arbitrary N

The aim of this section is to obtain an exact expression of the maximal velocity V (N )
of the centipede for an arbitrary fermion number N . This quantity, deﬁned in (3.5),
characterizes the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the wavefunction in
the center-of-mass coordinate. We shall also derive the exact value of the limit V (∞).
The explicit results given in section 5 for the ﬁrst few values of N suggest
the following pattern. The maximal velocity V (N ) is reached for the values of
the center-of-mass momentum q such that the right-hand side of the characteristic
equations (4.14), (4.15) vanishes, i.e., q = 0 or ±π when N is even, whereas q = ±π/2
when N is odd. In these situations, all the quasiparticle eigenvalues Λk are twofold
degenerate. The simultaneous linear lifting of these degeneracies yields, by means
of (4.10), the largest possible value of the group velocity.

Let us consider for deﬁniteness the case where N is even, and set

sin((N + 1)p) − 3 sin((N − 1)p)

sin p

= PN (Λ),

(6.1)

with Λ = cos p (see (4.13), (A.9)). The function PN (Λ) thus deﬁned is a polynomial
with degree N , which can be expressed as a linear combination of two Chebyshev
polynomials of the second kind [37]:

PN (Λ) = UN (Λ) − 3UN−2(Λ).

The polynomials PN obey the recursion

(6.2)

(6.3)
We have P0(Λ) = 4, P1(Λ) = 2Λ, P2(Λ) = 4(Λ2 − 1), P3(Λ) = 2Λ(4Λ2 − 5), and so
on. The characteristic equation (4.14) can thus be recast as

PN +1(Λ) = 2ΛPN (Λ) − PN−1(Λ).

PN (Λ) = ±4 sin q.

(6.4)

For q = 0 or q = π, the right-hand side vanishes. The doubly degenerate quasiparticle
eigenvalues therefore coincide with the N roots Λk of the polynomial PN . The lifting
of these twofold degeneracies in the vicinity of q = 0 or q = π is described by the slopes

Using (4.10), taking care about avoiding multiple counting, we obtain the expression

V (N ) =

NXk=1

|P ′N (Λk)|

(6.6)

for the maximal spreading velocity. The case where N is odd can be dealt with in a
similar way and yields the same expression.

The general formula (6.6) allows us to recover (5.5), (5.11), (5.16), (5.19), i.e.,

V (2) = 1, V (3) =

and to predict that

V (6) = 0.620 924 . . . ,

(6.8)
are the largest roots of the polynomial equations 229V 4 − 78V 2 − 8V + 1 = 0 and
79 937V 3 − 49 192V 2 − 3 664V + 2 624 = 0, with respective degrees 4 and 3. More
generally, the maximal velocity V (N ) is an algebraic number whose degree dN grows
exponentially fast with N . Let us skip details and give the following result:

V (7) = 0.600 722 . . .

N = 2m even:

N = 2m + 1 odd:

where Int(.) denotes the integer part.

d2m = 2m−1,

d2m+1 =(cid:18) m

Int(m/2)(cid:19),

(6.9)

As the fermion number N increases, the velocities V (N ) converge to a ﬁnite
limit V (∞), which can be obtained as follows. For N ≥ 3, N − 2 roots Λk of the
polynomial PN obey |Λk| < 1. They correspond to real momenta pk, such that

N pk = kπ + θk

(k = 1, . . . , N − 2),

(6.10)

with |θk| ≤ π/2 and

tan θk = 2 tan pk.

(6.11)
The last two roots satisfy |Λ| > 1. They correspond to evanescent modes with complex
momenta p = iζ and p = π + iζ, such that Λ = ± cosh ζ, with tanh(N ζ) = 2 tanh ζ.
In the large-N limit, we have tanh ζ → 1/2, and so ζ → (ln 3)/2 (see (6.14)) and
Λ → ±2/√3.
By diﬀerentiating (6.1), using (6.10) and (6.11), we obtain the following estimate

|P ′N (Λk)| ≈

2N

sin2 pk

for large N and real momenta pk. Finally, inserting the above expression into (6.6),
and replacing the sum by an integral, we obtain

7. Discussion

We have investigated a quantum centipede made of N fermionic quantum walkers
on the one-dimensional lattice interacting by the hard constraint that the distance
between two successive fermions is either one or two lattice spacings. Besides the
number N of fermions, the model is entirely parameter-free.

As in our previous work [24], the main emphasis has been put on the ballistic
spreading of the wavefunction of the centipede in its center-of-mass coordinate. For
a generic initial state located in the vicinity of the origin, the distribution proﬁle of
the velocity v = n/t of the center of mass generically exhibits two extremal ballistic
fronts at ±V (N ), as well as internal ballistic fronts, whose number grows rapidly with
the number N of fermions.
The energy spectrum of the centipede and the corresponding velocity dispersion
curve have been analyzed by direct means for the ﬁrst few values of N , whereas some
analytical results have been derived for arbitrary N by exploiting a mapping of the
problem onto a free-fermion system. We have thus obtained the expression (6.6) of the
maximal spreading velocity V (N ), and the non-trivial result (6.13) for the limit V (∞).
It is interesting to put the present ﬁndings in perspective with the results of [25] on
the diﬀusive dynamics of N -legged molecules dubbed polypeds and spiders [38]. The

Quantum centipedes

17

classical analogue of the present situation is that of symmetric molecular centipedes,
whose diﬀusion coeﬃcient is given (for all N ≥ 2) by

.

(7.1)

D(N ) =

1

4(N − 1)

There is a stark contrast between the fall-oﬀ of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(N ) for
large N in the classical case and the convergence of the spreading velocity to a ﬁnite
limit V (∞) in the quantum case. This is yet another manifestation of the qualitatively
diﬀerent dynamical behavior of classical and quantum walkers.

Some of the properties of the quantum centipede depend on the parity of the
fermion number N . The symmetries of the energy spectrum ensure the existence of a
ﬂat (i.e., non-dispersive) band when N is odd. As a consequence, the wavefunction of
the centipede may exhibit a central peak near the origin for odd N . (This is illustrated
in ﬁgure 5 for N = 3.) The occurrence of a central peak has been underlined in
other types of quantum walks. For a single discrete-time walker equipped with a
three-dimensional quantum coin, a localization phenomenon has been put forward,
in the sense that a ﬁnite fraction of the probability stays forever in the vicinity
of the particle’s starting point [39, 40]. From a diﬀerent perspective, parity eﬀects
are also known to aﬀect transport properties of some quasi-one-dimensional systems.
Disordered strips made of N coupled channels with purely oﬀ-diagonal disorder are
known to exhibit conventional Anderson localization for even N , albeit unconventional
localization properties for odd N , with a subexponential scaling of the conductance
at the band center [41, 42, 43, 44].

In this work we have demonstrated that the simplest fermionic quantum
centipede, with maximal separation ℓ = 2 between neighboring particles, is tractable
by analytical means.
It would be interesting to investigate fermionic or bosonic
quantum centipedes with larger maximal separations as well. Classical centipedes
with ℓ ≥ 3 however lead to extremely complicated results, so that the general case
seems intractable [25]. Another variant that has been studied in the classical case is
a centipede whose total length never exceeds some given length L [25]. Its quantum
analogue also appears to be interesting. Finally, it might also be worth considering
bound states of N quantum walkers, either fermionic or bosonic, on higher-dimensional
lattices with various kinds of hard-bound constraints.

Appendix A. Derivation of the characteristic equations (4.14), (4.15)

In this appendix we provide a detailed characterization of the quasiparticle operators
deﬁned in (4.11) and a derivation of the characteristic equations (4.14), (4.15).

Our starting point is the quadratic identity

j − δjkδµλτ ν

where µ, ν, λ = x, y, that follows from the Cliﬀord algebra (4.6). We can then write
explicitly the commutation relation [Hlong, ak] = −2Λkak (see (4.12)) as follows

(The subscript k = 0, . . . , N has been omitted for ease of reading.) After identifying
the coeﬃcients of each τ x,y
, we obtain the following system of linear equations for the
coeﬃcients xj and yj:
For j = 0:

j

x0 = 0, −iΛy0 = x1 cos q + y1 sin q.

For j = 1:

2iΛx1 = 2y0 cos q + y2, −2iΛy1 = x2 − 2y0 sin q.

For j = 2, . . . , N − 2:

For j = N − 1:

For j = N :

2iΛxj = yj−1 + yj+1, −2iΛyj = xj−1 + xj+1.

2iΛxN−1 = yN−2, −2iΛyN−1 = xN−2 + 2xN .

iΛxN = yN−1,

yN = 0.

(A.3)

(A.4)

(A.5)

(A.6)

(A.7)

(A.9)

(A.10)

The above equations can be interpreted as an eigenvalue problem for the vector
(x0, y0, x1, y1, . . . , xN , yN ) of length 2(N + 1). The quasiparticle eigenvalues Λ are
obtained as follows. The bulk equations (A.5) yield the recursion

4Λ2xj = xj−2 + 2xj + xj+2

(A.8)
The corresponding characteristic equation is bi-quadratic: 4Λ2 = r−2 + 2 + r2 =
(r−1 + r)2. The four values r = ±e±ip lead to the dispersion relation

(j = 2, . . . , N − 2).

Λ = cos p.

Using (A.5) and (A.9), the corresponding eigenvectors read

xj = Aeijp + Be−ijp + (−1)j(Ceijp + De−ijp),
−iyj = Aeijp + Be−ijp − (−1)j(Ceijp + De−ijp).

The values of p are yet to be determined by the boundary conditions. First, using (A.3)
and (A.7), we substitute y0 and xN in (A.4) and (A.6) to obtain

2Λ2x1 = (1 + cos 2q)x1 + sin 2q y1 − iΛy2,
2Λ2y1 = sin 2q x1 + (1 − cos 2q)y1 + iΛx2,
2iΛxN−1 = yN−2,
2Λ2yN−1 = iΛxN−2 + 2yN−1.

(A.11)

imposing that the generic forms (A.10) remain valid for j = 1 and j =

Then,
N − 1, (A.11) yields

e2iq(eipA + e−ipB) − i sin p (C − D) = 0,
i sin p (A − B) − e−2iq(eipC + e−ipD) = 0,
eiN pA + e−iN pB − (−1)N (eiN pC + e−iN pD) = 0,
eiN p(eip − 3e−ip)A + e−iN p(e−ip − 3eip)B

+ (−1)N (eiN p(eip − 3e−ip)C + e−iN p(e−ip − 3eip)D) = 0.

Expressing that the 4 × 4 determinant of this system vanishes, we get

cos(2(N + 1)p) − 6 cos(2N p) + 9 cos(2(N − 1)p)
= 2(1 + cos 2p) + 8(−1)N cos 2q (1 − cos 2p).

(A.12)

(A.13)

Quantum centipedes

The characteristic equation thus obtained is a polynomial equation with degree
N + 1 in the variable cos 2p = 2Λ2 − 1. The value p = 0 is however not allowed.
The eigenvectors constructed as above indeed vanish identically for p = 0. We are
thus left with N pairs of opposite quasiparticle eigenvalues ±Λk. This spectrum is
to be completed by Λ = 0 with multiplicity two. For eip = ±i the system (A.12)
indeed always admits the solution A = B = C = D, irrespective of q. This elementary
non-dispersive solution had been discarded in the algebra leading to (A.13).

Inserting the above quasiparticle spectrum into (4.10) yields the 2N +1 (possibly
degenerate) eigenvalues ωlong of Hlong. A quarter of them, corresponding to the sector
(+1, +1) of the boundary operators Sx
N , coincide with the 2N−1 (again possibly
degenerate) eigenvalues ω of H.
and (4.15), by dealing separately with even and odd values of N .

Finally, the characteristic equation (A.13) can be further simpliﬁed to (4.14)

0 and Sx
