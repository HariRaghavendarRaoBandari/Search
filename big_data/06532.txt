Shear and depth-averaged Stokes drift under a Phillips-type

spectrum
Øyvind Breivik∗

March 22, 2016

Abstract

The transport and shear under a Phillips-type spectrum are presented. A combined proﬁle for
monochromatic swell and a Phillips-type wind sea spectrum which can be used to investigate the
shear under crossing seas is then presented.

Introduction

The Stokes drift proﬁle under a Phillips-type (Phillips, 1958) spectrum was explored by Breivik et al.
(2014) and later in more detail by Breivik et al. (2016). The proﬁle was shown to give a good
approximation to the proﬁle under an arbitrary spectrum. Here I explore some of the features of the
proﬁle under such a spectrum. In Sec 2 I derive an expression for the depth-averaged proﬁle. This
is needed to compute the depth-averaged Stokes drift for an arbitrary portion of the water column,
which in turn is required in order to estimate the Stokes drift experienced by an object immersed
in the water column. This has practical implications for the computation of the trajectories of
drifting objects (Breivik and Allen, 2008; Breivik et al., 2011, 2012b,a, 2013) as well as for the fate
of oil in the ocean (McWilliams and Sullivan, 2000).
In Sec 3 I present the general shear of the
Phillips-type spectrum. This is required for the computation of the Langmuir-production term in the
turbulent kinetic energy equation (McWilliams et al., 1997). In Sec 4 I derive a combined proﬁle for
a monochromatic swell component and a wide-band wind sea spectrum where I assume the Phillips
proﬁle. This is of interest for investigations of the impact of crossing swell and wind sea on e.g.
Langmuir turbulence (McWilliams et al., 2014).

2 The Stokes drift transport and depth-averaged Stokes
drift under the Phillips spectrum

For a directional wave spectrum E(ω, θ) the Stokes drift velocity in deep water is given by

where θ is the direction in which the wave component is travelling, ω is the circular frequency and ˆk
is the unit vector in the direction of wave propagation. This can be derived from the expression for a
wavenumber spectrum in arbitrary depth ﬁrst presented by Kenyon (1969) by using the deep-water
dispersion relation ω2 = gk. For simplicity we will now investigate the Stokes drift proﬁle under the
one-dimensional frequency spectrum

yields a reasonable estimate of the part of the spectrum which contributes most to the Stokes drift
velocity near the surface, i.e., the high-frequency waves. Here ωp is the peak frequency. We assume
Phillips’ parameter α = 0.0083. The Stokes drift velocity proﬁle under (4) is

Let us assume, like Breivik et al. (2016) do (hereafter BBJ), that the Phillips spectrum proﬁle (6)

is a reasonable approximation for Stokes drift velocity proﬁles under a general spectrum,

(1 − 2β/3).

(8)

We can now determine the inverse depth scale k, given an estimate of the transport V and the
surface Stokes drift velocity v0. Both, as Breivik et al. (2014) argued, are normally available from
wave models.

Note that we still need to estimate β, but BBJ found β = 1 to be a very good approximation. Note
also that estimating the Stokes transport from a one-dimensional Stokes drift proﬁle will overestimate
it since the directional spreading of waves tends to cancel out some of the contributions. This eﬀect is
ignored by assuming all waves to be propagating in the same direction. The Stokes transport should
typically be reduced by about 17% (Ardhuin et al., 2009; Breivik et al., 2014). The spreading factor
proposed by Webb and Fox-Kemper (2015) could be used to further correct the proﬁle.

It is useful to know the average Stokes drift over a part of the water column, for example to
compute the average Stokes drift experienced by a submerged object. By again assuming the Phillips
proﬁle it is possible to provide a closed-form expression for the integral of Eq (7), i.e., the Stokes drift
transport between the vertical level z0 and the surface,

See the appendix for a full derivation. Obviously, in order to ﬁnd the average Stokes drift between a
lower level z0 and an upper level z1 all that is needed is to use Eq (9) twice to ﬁnd

Fig 1 shows the transport under the Phillips spectrum (10 s peak period) integrated to depth z0.
The analytical solution (9) is found to be identical within numerical accuracy. Eq (9) represents the
transport between level z0 and the surface.

4 A combined Stokes proﬁle for swell and wind sea

Let us decompose the Stokes drift velocity in a swell component and a wind sea component,

vs = vsw + vws.

Let us assume that the swell is well represented by the monochromatic proﬁle such that

vsw = vsw,0e2kswz ˆksw.

(13)

(14)

Here ˆksw is a unit vector in the swell propagation direction. The wavenumber is found from the linear
deep-water dispersion relation to be ksw = 4π2f 2
sw/g. We ﬁnd the surface swell Stokes drift speed to
be

The transport can shown (Breivik et al., 2014) to be

vsw,0 = 2kswVsw.

Vsw = 2πmsw

sw.

(15)

(16)

Assume that Eq (7) is a good approximation for the wind sea part of the Stokes proﬁle, and let

the surface Stokes drift from the wind sea part of the spectrum be deﬁned as

vws,0 = |vs,0 − vsw,0|.

(17)

The wind sea transport Vws is determined similarly as the swell transport (16). Finally, the inverse
depth scale of the wind sea Stokes drift proﬁle is found from Eq (8),

kws =

(1 − 2β/3).

Vws

(18)

This allows us to estimate a simple combined proﬁle with a directional veering due to the presence
of swell. The parameters can all be estimated from standard output from wave reanalyses such as
ERA-Interim (Dee et al., 2011).
