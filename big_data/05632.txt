A QUASILINEAR BISTABLE EQUATION IN CYLINDERS AND TIMELIKE

HETEROCLINICS IN SPECIAL RELATIVITY

DENIS BONHEURE, ISABEL COELHO, AND MANON NYS

Abstract. In this note we consider the action functional

ZR×ω(cid:16)1 −p1 − |∇u|2 + W (u)(cid:17) d¯x

where W is a double well potential and ω is a bounded domain of RN −1. We prove existence,
one-dimensionality and uniqueness (up to translation) of a smooth minimizing phase transition
between the two stable states u = 1 and u = −1. The question of existence of at least one minimal
heteroclinic connection for the non autonomous model

is also addressed. For this, we look for the possible assumptions on a(t) ensuring the existence of
a minimizer.

ZR(cid:16)1 −p1 − |u′|2 + a(t)W (u)(cid:17) dt

It is known that any minimizer of the Allen-Cahn energy functional

being a bounded domain of RN−1 for N ≥ 1, must be a function of the ﬁrst variable only, and is
therefore given by tanh( x+a√2
This minimization problem takes its origin in the van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard gradient theory of
phase separations [35, 2, 39]. Assume a two-phase ﬂuid whose density at point ¯x is denoted by u(¯x)
has energy density given by 1
4 (u2 − 1)2. The densities u = ±1 correspond to stable ﬂuid phases.
When the two distinct phases coexist, they minimize their interaction. At a microscopic scale, this
amounts to study the above energy functional. The term R 1
4 (u2 − 1)2 penalizes the interaction of
the two phases while the presence of the kinetic term R |∇u|2 accounts to penalize the formation
of unnecessary interfaces. In the context of superconductivity, the functional E is known as the
Ginzburg-Landau energy without magnetic ﬁeld, see e.g. [17].

In this paper, we ﬁrst consider the modiﬁed autonomous free-energy functional

J (u) = ZR×ω(cid:18)1 −q1 − |∇u|2 + W (u)(cid:19) d¯x.

K(u) = ZR×ω(cid:18)1 −q1 − |∇u|2(cid:19) d¯x

can be seen as a kinetic energy which attempts to minimize the area of the interface between the
two phases. This model supposes that all transitions occur with an a priori bounded gradient
(we have normalized this a priori bound to 1 but this is clearly not restrictive). Since the kinetic
part is now singular at this threshold value of the norm of the gradient, it clearly penalizes sharp
transitions between the two phases. On the other hand, we have the pointwise estimates

which appears, at least formally, as the derivative of the volume integral (1.3), has been extensively
studied in the recent years. We quote for example [14, 15, 16] which are concerned with a one-
dimensional Neumann problem. For the Dirichlet problem we mention [15, 16, 27, 12, 13, 31], in
one-dimensional or radial settings, and [29, 11, 10] in a general bounded domain; while the periodic
problem is addressed in [15, 7, 24, 25, 33, 34]. We also refer to the survey of Mawhin [38] and
the references therein to be as exhaustive as possible. To our knowledge, less attention has been
given to problems in unbounded domains or in the whole space. We mention in that direction
[20, 3, 4, 19, 6, 18] for ground state type solutions in the whole space and [30, 28] where the authors
considered heteroclinic solutions in frameworks that include the operator Q(u). The operator Q is
a classical object in Riemannian geometry. Indeed, if u is a smooth function of N variables with
k∇ukL∞ < 1, the graph of u is (a piece of) a N -dimensional surface in the Lorentz-Minkowski
space LN +1 whose local mean curvature is given by Q(u), see for instance [5]. The volume integral
K(u) can then be seen as the area integral in LN +1 and surfaces of minimal or maximal area
solve the equation Q(u) = 0. Within a quite diﬀerent context, namely in the nonlinear theory
of electromagnetism, this operator appears in the formulation of the Born-Infeld ﬁeld theory, see
[23, 40, 37, 19] and the references therein.

In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we prove a Gibbons-type conjecture in cylinders for the singular
operator Q(u). Namely, we prove that the free-energy functional J has a minimizer in X , and that
this minimizer has to be one-dimensional, i.e. independent from y ∈ ω.
Theorem 1.1. Assume (W1) and (W2). The functional J deﬁned in (1.1) attains its inﬁmum
in X . Moreover any minimizer of J depends only on the ﬁrst variable x ∈ R and is the unique
solution, up to translations, of the equation

The main technical diﬃculty in describing the phase transition consists in showing that the
minimizers of the energy functional satisfy the (formaly) associated Euler-Lagrange equation. This
leads to prove that the gradient of the minimizer, or simply the derivative once we know the
minimizer depends on a single space variable, is bounded away from 1.

In the second part of the paper, we focus on a time-dependent one-dimensional system in special

relativity. The Lagrangian

La(t, u(t), u′(t)) = mc2

1 −s1 −

describes the motion of a particle of rest mass m whose time-dependent potential energy is given
by −a(t)W . In the non-relativistic limit c → +∞, this Lagrangian yields the usual equation of
motion

In the relativistic regime, assuming that the motion is strictly timelike, that is |u′(t)| < c, we can
use the phase-space variables

mu′′(t) = a(t)W ′(u(t)).

so that the equations of motion can be written as a regular system of ﬁrst order equations

We conclude this work discussing the case where the functional La satisﬁes additional symmetry
properties. We will consider (W1) and the following additional assumptions
(W ′2) W (s) > 0 if s ∈ (−1, 1) and W (s) = 0 for all s ∈ R \ (−1, 1),
(W3) W (s) = W (−s) for all s ∈ R,
(a2) a(t) ∈ L∞loc(R),
(a3) a(s) ≤ a(t) for a.e. 0 ≤ s ≤ t,
(a4) a(t) = a(−t) for a.e. t ∈ R,
(a5) there exists T > 0 such that a(t) > 0 for all t > T .
Notice that we do not impose (a1) from now on. Moreover, a(t) can take negative values on a
compact set. For this reason, we consider the new assumption (W ′2) that forces the solution to take
values in [−1, 1], which would not be clear (and maybe not true) under (W2). Since W and a are
even, we will look for an odd minimizer of La in the set

X odd

:= {u ∈ X1 | u(−t) = −u(t) for all t ∈ R}.

Obviously, this does not exclude the existence of other critical points of La in X1 that are not
antisymmetric. In particular it does not imply that the global minimizer of La in X1 is an anti-
symmetric function. This is an open interesting problem even for simpler semilinear or quasilinear
operators.

Due to the symmetry assumptions, we can write

In Section 2, we prove Theorem 1.1. The proof of this
theorem will be divided in several steps. First, we basically reduce the problem to a one-dimensional
setting. To do this, we use the classical monotone rearrangement used in [36, 26, 1] to prove that
any minimizing sequence of J in X can be assumed to depend only on the ﬁrst variable. The
arguments are quite classical, though some technical adaptations to our functional setting are
required. The existence of a one-dimensional minimizer is somehow standard. Then, by using a
stretching argument on the minimizer (see Deﬁnition 2.10), we obtain an a priori bound on the
derivative, and therefore conclude that the minimizer solves the Euler-Lagrange equations. Finally,
an additional argument is used to prove that any minimizer is one-dimensional, since we are not
able to use the rearrangement argument for functions u with k∇ukL∞ = 1. However, since the
derivative of the volume integral K(u) has a convex singularity on these functions, it is expected
that such minimizer cannot exist. We conﬁrm this by performing a regularization of the volume
integral, inspired from [27].

In Section 3, we consider the non-autonomous functional La given by (1.8). We prove Theorems
1.2 and 1.3, reasoning in the same way as in the proofs of respectively [21, Theorem 2.5, Theorem
2.4]. Finally, the last part of Section 3 is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1.6.

2. Optimal shape of phase separation in cylinders

2.1. Monotone rearrangement. To prove Theorem 1.1, we will use a notion of monotone re-
arrangement of functions that we ﬁrst recall. This rearrangement was ﬁrst introduced in [26], see
also [32, 36] and [1] for a deeper study. This rearrangement is a generalization of the classical
monotone rearrangement for functions of a single variable. We believe that the adaptation of this
rearrangement to our setting has an interest in itself. We anticipate that a shorter path to get
one-dimensionality will be provided in Theorem 2.15. However, the monotone rearrangement has
the advantage of directly providing a monotone minimizing sequence.

For any function u : R × ω → [−1, 1], we deﬁne the level sets of u as

Ωc = ( {(x, y) ∈ R × ω | 0 ≤ u(x, y) ≤ c}
{(x, y) ∈ R × ω | c < u(x, y) < 0}

if 0 ≤ c ≤ 1,
if − 1 ≤ c < 0.

Assume that u : R × ω → [−1, 1] belongs to X , deﬁned in (1.2), and observe that it implies that
its level sets Ωc have ﬁnite measure for any c ∈ (−1, 1), while mN (Ω−1) = mN (Ω1) = +∞, where
mN represents the Lebesgue measure in dimension N . Deﬁne the associated distribution function
au : (−1, 1) → R by

au(c) = 


mN (Ωc)
mN−1(ω)
mN (Ωc)
mN−1(ω)

−

if 0 ≤ c < 1

if − 1 < c < 0,

where we may assume that mN−1(ω) = 1, if N = 1.
In general, the distribution function is
nondecreasing, but since functions u ∈ X are continuous, the function au is in fact increasing. In
addition, one easily checks that it is right-continuous by construction. We emphasize that au can
have at most a countable set of jump discontinuities, corresponding to the values of c ∈ (−1, 1) for
which mN ({(x, y) ∈ R × ω | u(x, y) = c}) > 0.
Next, we deﬁne the one-dimensional nondecreasing rearrangement u⋆ : R × ω → [−1, 1] of u
through its level sets

Ω⋆

c = ( {(x, y) ∈ R × ω | 0 ≤ u⋆(x, y) ≤ c} = [0, au(c)] × ω
{(x, y) ∈ R × ω | c < u⋆(x, y) < 0} = (au(c), 0) × ω

if 0 ≤ c < 1,
if − 1 < c < 0,

and

Ω⋆
1 = [0, +∞) × ω

and Ω⋆

−1 = (−∞, 0) × ω.

We immediately remark that the function u⋆ depends only on the x-variable because its level sets
are cylinders. In the sequel, we use the notation u⋆(x) = u⋆(x, y) for all y ∈ ω.
Basically, we aim to deﬁne u⋆ as the inverse of the function au(c). This will be indeed the case
if au is continuous. More precisely, denoting by I ⊂ R the range of au, xi = inf I, and xs = sup I,
we ﬁrst set u⋆(x) = −1 for any x ≤ xi if xi > −∞ and u⋆(x) = 1 for any x ≥ xs if xs < +∞.
Next, if x ∈ I, there exists c ∈ (−1, 1) such that au(c) = x and we simply deﬁne u⋆(x) = c. For
any x ∈ (xi, xs) \ I, we consider

ξx = inf{ξ ≥ x| ξ ∈ I}.

The value ξx belongs to I because au is right-continuous and increasing. Therefore there exists
cx ∈ (−1, 1) such that au(cx) = ξx and we deﬁne u⋆(x) = cx. One easily sees that u⋆ is a
nondecreasing function with u⋆(0) = 0. We observe that u⋆ is an increasing function only if au is
continuous. One can check from its deﬁnition that u⋆ is continuous. This will also be a consequence
of the next lemma which shows that starting from a function u ∈ X , we have u⋆ ∈ X .
Lemma 2.1. If u ∈ X , takes values in [−1, 1] and |∇u| ∈ L2(R × ω), then u⋆ ∈ X and

k∇u⋆kL∞(R×ω;RN ) ≤ k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ).

(2.12)

This result is a Pólya-Szegö type inequality. In order to prove this statement, we will use the

following (standard) lemma whose proof is included for completeness.
Lemma 2.2. If f ∈ Lp(R×ω) for all 1 ≤ p < +∞ and supp kfkLp(R×ω) < +∞, then f ∈ L∞(R×ω).

6

Proof. Assume by contradiction that kfkL∞(R×ω) = +∞. Then for all R > 0, there exists a set
ΩR ⊂ R × ω with positive Lebesgue measure such that |f (x)| ≥ R in ΩR. This implies that

kfkLp(R×ω) ≥ (cid:18)ZΩR |f (x)|p(cid:19)1/p

≥ mN (ΩR)1/pR.

Taking the limit as p → +∞, we obtain

Since R > 0 is arbitrary, this contradicts the uniform boundedness of f in the Lp-norm.

lim inf

p→+∞ kfkLp(R×ω) ≥ R.

(cid:3)

We will also use the following consequence of the P´olya-Szeg¨o type inequality proved by Alberti

[1, Theorem 2.10].
Theorem 2.3. Assume g : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞) is convex, increasing and g(0) = 0. Then, for every
u ∈ X taking values in [−1, 1], we have
ZR×ω

g(|∇u⋆|) ≤ ZR×ω

g(|∇u|).

Moreover, when the left-hand side is ﬁnite, equality holds if and only if there exists a ∈ R such that
u(x + a, y) = u⋆(x) for every (x, y) ∈ R × ω.

The proof of Lemma 2.1 is now a consequence of Theorem 2.3 and Lemma 2.2.

Proof of Lemma 2.1. First, observe that since ∇u : R × ω → RN is square integrable and |∇u| is
uniformly bounded by 1, we have

k∇ukLp(R×ω;RN ) = (cid:18)ZR×ω |∇u|p(cid:19)1/p

≤ (cid:18)ZR×ω |∇u|2(cid:19)1/p
where M is independent of p. This shows that |∇u| ∈ Lp(R × ω) for all 2 ≤ p < +∞ and also that
supp≥2 k∇ukLp(R×ω;RN ) < +∞. Using Theorem 2.3 with g(t) = tp, for p ≥ 2, we infer that

= (cid:18)ZR×ω |∇u|2|∇u|p−2(cid:19)1/p

≤ M,

k∇u⋆kLp(R×ω;RN ) ≤ k∇ukLp(R×ω;RN )

which implies that |∇u⋆| ∈ Lp(R × ω) for all 2 ≤ p < +∞ and gives an uniform bound as well.
Lemma 2.2 allows to conclude that |∇u⋆| ∈ L∞(R × ω). To prove that u⋆ ∈ X , we ﬁrst claim that

Indeed, using again Theorem 2.3 with g(t) = tp, we deduce that

lim sup

p→+∞ k∇u⋆kLp(R×ω;RN ) ≤ k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ).

k∇u⋆kLp(R×ω;RN ) ≤ k∇ukLp(R×ω;RN ) ≤ k∇uk

p

p−2

L∞(R×ω;RN )(cid:18)ZR×ω |∇u|2(cid:19)1/p

,

so that our claim easily follows by taking the limit as p → +∞ in both sides of the inequality.

To establish (2.12), it is enough to prove that

p→+∞ k∇u⋆kLp(R×ω;RN ).
Fix ε > 0 and deﬁne Ωε ⊂ R × ω with ﬁnite positive measure such that

k∇u⋆kL∞(R×ω;RN ) ≤ lim inf

Then

|∇u⋆(x)| ≥ (1 − ε)k∇u⋆kL∞(R×ω;RN )

for all x ∈ Ωε.

= (1 − ε)mN (Ωε)1/pk∇u⋆kL∞(R×ω;RN ).

Taking the limit as p → +∞, we obtain

lim inf

p→+∞ k∇u⋆kLp(R×ω;RN ) ≥ (1 − ε)k∇u⋆kL∞(R×ω;RN )

and since ε is arbitrary, the conclusion follows.

As an immediate consequence of (2.12), we deduce that |∇u⋆| is uniformly bounded by 1 and

therefore u⋆ ∈ X , as limx→±∞ u⋆(x) = ±1 by construction.
Remark 2.4. Although the uniform square-integrability of |∇u| in Lemma 2.1 seams a restrictive
assumption at ﬁrst, it will be naturally satisﬁed by the elements of any minimizing sequence for the
functional J as it follows from the boundedness of the energy and inequality (1.4).

(cid:3)

In the following theorem, we prove that the volume integral K(u), deﬁned in (1.3), does not

increase under the monotone rearrangement.
Theorem 2.5. For any u ∈ X , taking values in [−1, 1] and such that |∇u| ∈ L2(R × ω), we have
(2.13)

ZR×ω(cid:18)1 −q1 − |∇u⋆|2(cid:19) ≤ ZR×ω(cid:18)1 −q1 − |∇u|2(cid:19) .

Moreover, if k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) < 1, we have equality if and only if there exists a ∈ R such that
u(x + a, y) = u⋆(x) for every (x, y) ∈ R × ω.
To prove this theorem, one would like to rely on Theorem 2.3 with the function g(t) = 1−√1 − t2.
However, this function is not deﬁned in the whole interval [0, +∞) and cannot be extended to this
interval as a convex function, since at t = 1, its derivative is not ﬁnite. Anyway, we can overcome
this problem arguing by truncation close to t = 1.
Deﬁnition 2.6. For all n ∈ N0, we set hn, Ψn : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞) such that

h(x, y) =( 1

|∇u(x, y)|2

if (x, y) ∈ A,
if (x, y) 6∈ A,

such that

Applying Lebesgue’s dominated convergence, we can take the limit as n → +∞ in the right-hand
side of (2.14). Arguing similarly for the left-hand side, we deduce (2.13).

Ψn(|∇u(x, y)|) ≤ h(x, y)

for all n ≥ 2.

8

When k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) < 1, we can choose n large enough so that

Ψn(|∇u(x, y)|) = 1 −q1 − |∇u(x, y)|2

for all (x, y) ∈ R × ω

In addition, in this case, since the
and the conclusion follows immediately from Theorem 2.3.
right-hand side of (2.13) is ﬁnite, we also deduce that equality holds in (2.13) if and only if there
exists a ∈ R such that u(x + a, y) = u⋆(x) for every (x, y) ∈ R × ω.
(cid:3)

We can now deduce the following proposition.

Proposition 2.7. For all u ∈ X , taking values in [−1, 1], and satisfying |∇u| ∈ L2(R × ω), there
exists u⋆ ∈ X (depending only on x ∈ R) such that

J (u⋆) ≤ J (u).

Moreover, if k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) < 1, we have equality if and only if there exists a ∈ R such that
u(x + a, y) = u⋆(x) for every (x, y) ∈ R × ω.
Proof. Let u ∈ X taking values in [−1, 1] and u⋆ ∈ X be its monotone rearrangement as deﬁned
above. Combining Theorem 2.5 and Cavalieri’s principle, see for example [1, Theorem 2.6], we
obtain the statement of the theorem.
(cid:3)

2.2. Existence of a one-dimensional minimizer. Let us ﬁrst notice that the functional J is
bounded from below in X , as J (u) ≥ 0 for all u ∈ X .
Lemma 2.8. There exists a minimizing sequence (un)n ⊂ X satisfying un(x, y) = un(x) for all
(x, y) ∈ R × ω and all n ∈ N0. Moreover for every n ∈ N0, un is a nondecreasing function taking
values in [−1, 1] and such that un(0) = 0.
Proof. Let (vn)n ⊂ X be a minimizing sequence of J , that is, J (vn) → infX J as n → +∞.
Deﬁning un = sup(−1, inf(vn, 1)) and observing that J (un) ≤ J (vn), we have −1 ≤ un ≤ 1 for all
n ∈ N0. The lemma is now an obvious consequence of Proposition 2.7.

(cid:3)

Consequently, for the minimizing sequence of Lemma 2.8, we have J (un) = mN−1(ω)J1(un),

where

J1(u) = Z +∞

−∞ (cid:18)1 −q1 − |u′(t)|2 + W (u(t))(cid:19) dt.

We will prove that this functional attains its minimum in the corresponding one-dimensional

space X1, deﬁned in (1.9).
Proposition 2.9. J1 attains its minimum in X1.
Proof. Consider a minimizing sequence (un)n ⊂ X1 as given by Lemma 2.8. Observe that for each
ε > 0, there is tn > 0 such that un(tn) = 1− ε, 0 ≤ un(t) ≤ 1− ε for all t ∈ [0, tn] and un(t) > 1− ε
for all t ∈ (tn, +∞). The sequence (tn)n is bounded, since

tn · min
[0,1−ε]

W ≤ J (un) ≤ C,

for some positive constant C independent from n. A similar argument shows that there exists a
bounded sequence (sn)n such that sn < 0, un(sn) = −1 + ε, −1 + ε ≤ un(t) ≤ 0 for all t ∈ [sn, 0]
and un(t) < −1 + ε for all t ∈ (−∞, sn).

From (1.4), it follows that supn ku′nkL2(R) is ﬁnite. In addition, since ku′nkL∞(R) ≤ 1 and

|un(t2) − un(t1)| = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Z t2

t1

u′n(s) ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

≤ |t2 − t1| ,

∀ n ∈ N0, ∀ t1, t2 ∈ R,

9

the sequence (un)n is equi-continuous. Therefore, by Ascoli-Arzel`a Theorem and the uniform
boundedness of (u′n)n in L2 ∩ L∞, there exists u ∈ W 1,∞(R) such that, up to a subsequence,

un −→ u uniformly on every compact set K ⊂ R,

u′n ⇀ u′ in L2(R),

as n → +∞. Moreover, from the uniform convergence we infer that u is nondecreasing, u(t) ∈
[−1, 1] for all t ∈ R and u(0) = 0. Considering another subsequence if necessary, we have from the
boundedness of (tn)n and (sn)n that tn → t > 0 and sn → s < 0, and u(t) > 1 − ε for all t > t
while u(t) < −1 + ε for all t < s.
We now prove that u ∈ X1 and is a minimizer of J1. Since W is nonnegative, applying Fatou’s
Lemma, we deduce that

On the other hand, the convexity of the function g(t) = 1 − √1 − t2 implies the weak lower

semi-continuity of the volume integral

Therefore one easily concludes that J1(u) ≤ infX1 J1.
clear that

It remains to prove that u ∈ X1. From the deﬁnitions of t and s and the monotonicity of u, it is

lim
t→−∞

u(t) = −1

and

lim
t→+∞

u(t) = +1.

Since for all n ∈ N0, the function un is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant Ln ≤ 1, we
conclude that u is also a Lipschitz function with Lipschitz constant L ≤ 1. Hence, by Rademacher’s
Theorem, u has a classical derivative a.e. in R and ku′kL∞(R) = L ≤ 1.

(cid:3)

We proved the existence of a minimizer of J1 in X1 and therefore of a one-dimensional mini-
mizer of J in X . Our next step will be to show that this minimizer satisﬁes k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) =
ku′kL∞(R) < 1, which allows to recover the Euler-Lagrange equation (1.5).
To do so, we introduce a family of auxiliary functions obtained by stretching the graph of a given
function u ∈ X1 on a bounded interval. We anticipate that we will apply this construction to a
minimizer of J1.
Deﬁnition 2.10. Let u ∈ X1. For any points t0 < t1 and any 0 < θ < 1, we deﬁne the function
uθ : R → R by

u(t)

uθ(t) = 

t0 ≤ t < t1,
t ≥ t1,

where t1 = t0 + t1−t0

1−θ > t1.

From its deﬁnition, it is easily seen that uθ ∈ X1 because we eventually lower the value of the

Lipschitz constant of u.
Proposition 2.11. If u is a minimizer of J1 in X1 then ku′kL∞(R) < 1 and u is the unique, up
to translations, classical solution of the boundary value problem (1.5)–(1.6). Moreover u satisﬁes
(1.7).

10

Proof. Let u be a minimizer of J1 in X1. Then J (u) ≤ J (v) for all v ∈ X1. In particular, this
inequality holds for v = uθ obtained from u by stretching it in any bounded interval as described
above. We will compare the energy of u and uθ. First, notice that

Taking the limit as θ → 0+, we obtain the following quantitative bound on the derivative of u

The fact that u is a classical heteroclinic solution of the autonomous scalar equation (1.5) now
follows from standard arguments. Notice that once we know that the minimizer u satisﬁes the
strict inequality ku′kL∞(R) < 1, the previous argument is reminiscent of a standard variation in
the spirit of the Dubois-Reymond Lemma and yields directly (1.7). Observe also that as soon as
ku′kL∞(R) < 1, it is a standard issue to prove the smoothness of the solution.
(cid:3)
Remark 2.12. As a consequence of Proposition 2.11, we see that if u ∈ X is a minimizer of J
and k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) = 1 then u cannot be one-dimensional.
Remark 2.13. We can also deduce the previous proposition from a gradient estimate from [5,
Theorem 4.1, Corollary 4.3]. However this argument does not give a quantitative bound and relies
moreover on more delicate estimates. We believe the argument we provide is the more direct one.
So far we proved the existence of a one-dimensional minimizer of J with k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) < 1.
From Proposition 2.7, we see that any minimizer of J with k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) < 1 depends only on
the ﬁrst variable. But our argument does not exclude the existence of a minimizing sequence of
J converging to some u0 ∈ X with k∇u0kL∞(R×ω;RN ) = 1. We will use a regularization argument
inspired from [27, 20] to rule out this possibility.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Arguing as in Propositions 2.9 and 2.11, we see that there exists a minimizer
u ∈ X of J with k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) < 1 which is a classical smooth solution of the boundary value
problem (1.5)–(1.6) and satisﬁes the conservation of energy law (1.7). The proof will be complete
once we can exclude the existence of minimizers u of J with k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) = 1.

We introduce the modiﬁed functional Jn : W 1,∞(R × ω) → [0, +∞] given by

where the function Ψn is given in Deﬁnition 2.6. The functional Jn is not singular since the function
Ψn is deﬁned in R. Also notice that for all u ∈ X and all n ∈ N0,

Jn(u) = ZR×ω

(Ψn(|∇u|) + W (u)) d¯x,

Jn(u) ≤ J (u),

12

and by the deﬁnition of Ψn the inequality is strict if k∇ukL∞(R×ω;RN ) = 1, since for every ε > 0
there exists a set E ⊂ R × ω with positive measure such that |∇u(x)| > 1 − ε for a.e. x ∈ E.
Moreover, Theorem 2.3 can be applied to this functional. So, arguing as above, we conclude that
Jn has a unique (up to translations) minimizer un ∈ X that depends only on the ﬁrst variable,
which is nondecreasing as a function of this variable and satisﬁes un(0) = 0. Besides, un is a
classical C 2 solution of the equation

where ψn = Ψ′n and un satisﬁes

(cid:0)ψn(u′)(cid:1)′ = W ′(u),
u(x) = ±1.

Moreover, any solution u of this equation satisﬁes the conservation of energy law

as long as |u′n|2 remains suﬃciently small. In particular, there is a sequence (tk)k such that tk → ±∞

see that En = 0 for all n ∈ N0. So, (2.16) gives

holds everywhere. In this way, we obtain an uniform bound for |u′n| and conclude that un ∈ X .

Now, let us assume that u0 ∈ X is a minimizer of J with k∇u0kL∞(R×ω;RN ) = 1. From Remark 2.12,
u0 is not one-dimensional. This means, in particular, that u0 is not a minimizer of Jn by our
previous discussion, but also as a consequence of Theorem 2.3. Then we obtain

J (un) = Jn(un).

J (un) = Jn(un) < Jn(u0) < J (u0),

which contradicts the fact that u0 minimizes J .

(cid:3)

We conclude this section with an example for which we can compute an explicit solution.

Example 2.14. By analogy with the classical Allen-Cahn equation (see [26, 1]), we are able to
compute the exact solutions to (1.5)–(1.6) when W is given by

2.3. One-dimensionality for non-autonomous potentials of the type W (x, u). In this sec-
tion, we consider a non-autonomous problem with a potential that depends spacially on the ﬁrst
variable only, that is, a potential of the type W (x, u).
In this situation we can still prove one-
dimensionality of the minimal transition with a quite short argument. Let us consider G : X →
[0, +∞] and G1 : X1 → [0, +∞] deﬁned respectively by

and

G(u) = ZR×ω(cid:18)1 −q1 − |∇u|2 + W (x, u)(cid:19) d¯x

X G = mN−1(ω) inf

X1 G1.

Moreover, if infX1 G1 is attained, then infX G can only be achieved by a one-dimensional minimizer
of G1.
Proof. Let (un)n ⊂ X1 be a minimizing sequence of G1. Taking un(x, y) = un(x) for all n ∈ N0, we
see that

G(un) = mN−1(ω)ZR(cid:18)1 −q1 − |u′n|2 + W (x, un(x))(cid:19) dx −→ mN−1(ω) inf

positive Lebesgue measure, such that ∇yu 6= 0 a.e. in B. Then the ﬁrst inequality in (2.17) is strict
for u, since

This leads to a contradiction.

|∇u|2 = |∂xu|2 + |∇yu|2 > |∂xu|2 ,

3. Heteroclinic solutions in special relativity

This section concerns the study of the functional La given in (1.8). As before, we will look for
minimizers of La in the functional space X1, where X1 is given in (1.9), and discuss the existence
of solutions to the associated Euler-Lagrange equation. Theorem 2.15 motivates to work with a
one-dimensional situation only.

We ﬁrst work out the regularity of minimizers. A diﬀerence with respect to the autonomous
situation is that we lose the conservation of energy. We will therefore argue diﬀerently to derive
the a priori bound on the derivative.

3.1. Regularity of the minimizer and solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation. The
following lemma tells us that assumptions (a2) and (W1) are suﬃcient to deduce that minimizers
are weak solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equation, as well as to derive a local bound on the
derivative.
Lemma 3.1. Assume (W1), (a2). If ua ∈ X1 is a minimizer of La, then ua is a C 1 ∩ W 2,2
of

and ku′akL∞
Proof. To prove the regularity, we will argue on compact sets of R and proceed in a similar way as
in [24, 8, 19]. Let M > 1 be any large number. If we denote by

and

a (u) = Z M
LM

−M (cid:18)1 −q1 − |u′|2 + a(t)W (u)(cid:19) dt
XM := {u ∈ X1 : u(t) = ua(t) for t ∈ R \ (−M, M )} ,

15

we immediately get that

for all u ∈ XM ,
by the minimality of ua. Next, we deﬁne the linearized functional

(3.18)

a (u) = Z M
E M

−M (cid:18)1 −q1 − |u′|2 + a(t)W ′(ua)u(cid:19) dt.

By hypothesis (W1) and (a2) and the fact that ua ∈ X1, this functional is bounded from below in
XM . Moreover, it is also strictly convex. Therefore it has an unique minimizer uM ∈ XM .

We claim that uM = ua. Using (3.18) and the convexity of the kinetic part

we get for ε > 0

KM (u) = Z M

−M (cid:18)1 −q1 − |u′|2(cid:19) dt,

a (ua) ≤ LM
Therefore,

−M

ε(cid:16)W (ua) − W(cid:0)ua + ε(uM − ua)(cid:1)(cid:17) dt.

Thanks to hypothesis (W1), (a2) and the fact that ua, uM ∈ X1, we can take the limit as ε → 0 to
obtain

Since the minimizer of E M

in XM is unique, the claim is proved.

Finally, since limt→±∞ ua(t) = ±1, we have that for M large enough,

ua(M ) − ua(−M )

2M

< 1.

Therefore, thanks to [5, Theorem 4.1, Corollary 4.3], see also [29, 9], we know that the minimizer
in XM is a C 1((−M, M )) ∩ W 2,2((−M, M )) solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation
ua of E M
associated to the functional E M

a and

ku′akL∞((−M,M )) < 1.

Remark 3.2. The argument in the proof of Lemma 3.1 is local. To obtain an uniform quantitative
bound, we can proceed exactly as in Proposition 2.11. However, we need some more restrictive
assumptions on a(t), namely (a1) and a ∈ C 0,1(R) with

In this case, we obtain the explicit quantitative bound

3.2. Proof of Theorems 1.2 and 1.3. Lemma 3.3 is a preliminary result giving a lower bound
on the energy functional La and will be useful for establishing the limit of minimizers at inﬁnity.
We state it without proof since it may be easily reconstructed from [22, Fact 1 in §2.1] using
estimate (1.4).

We will prove that there is a minimizing sequence (un)n ⊂ X1, satisfying the following conditions
for all n ∈ N0

(i) −1 ≤ un(t) ≤ 1 for all t ∈ R,

17

(ii) there exist sn, tn ∈ R, with sn < tn, such that

(a) un(sn) = −1 + ε, un(tn) = 1 − ε and −1 + ε ≤ un(t) ≤ 1 − ε for all t ∈ [sn, tn],

(iii) the sequences (sn)n and (tn)n are bounded.
Indeed, let (un)n ⊂ X1 be a minimizing sequence of La. Given the nonnegativity of both a and
W , we may argue as in the proof of Lemma 2.8 to assume that condition (i) is satisﬁed. To prove
(ii), let us ﬁx n and deﬁne an interval [sn, tn] such that

un(sn) = −1 + ε,

un(tn) = 1 − ε

and − 1 + ε ≤ un(t) ≤ 1 − ε for all t ∈ [sn, tn].

Since un ∈ X1, it is clearly possible to choose such an interval. So, (a) is proved. Now, suppose
that un does not satisfy condition (b). In particular, let us suppose that there is some t < sn for
which

un(t) > −1 + ε.

t2 = inf(cid:8)t ∈ (−∞, t]| un(t) > −1 + ε(cid:9).

t2 < sn,

un(t2) = −1 + ε

and

un(t) ≤ −1 + ε for all t ≤ t2.

t1 = sup(cid:8)t ∈ (−∞, t2)| un(t) < −1 + ε

We have

Therefore, if un does not satisfy the ﬁrst condition in (b), we may replace it with vn. So that there
is a minimizing sequence (un)n satisfying for all ﬁxed n ∈ N0

−1 ≤ un(t) ≤ −1 + ε

for all t ≤ sn

and

By a similar argument, we see that we may also assume that

and

Z +∞
tn (cid:18)1 −q1 − |u′n|2 + a(t)W (un)(cid:19) dt ≤ ν( ε

Thus, we have proved conditions (b) and (c). It remains to prove that the sequences (sn)n and
(tn)n are bounded. Since the sequence (La(un))n is bounded, and by (a1) there is some M > 0
such that

we may assume that sn → +∞. Then by assumption (b1), we have, for all n suﬃciently large,

But this contradicts the fact that (un)n is a minimizing sequence of La. So, we conclude that (sn)n
is bounded from above. In a similar way, we can prove that the sequence (tn)n is bounded from
below. On the other hand, it follows from the inequality

[−1+ε,1−ε]

W(cid:17)(tn − sn) ≤ Z sn

a(t)W (un) dt ≤ La(un)

that the sequence (tn − sn)n is bounded. We can then conclude that the sequences (sn)n and (tn)n
are also bounded.

Step 3. Convergence to a minimizer. Arguing as in the proof of Proposition 2.9, we see that
there is some u ∈ W 1,∞(R) such that, up to a subsequence,

un → u in C 1

loc(R)

and

u′n ⇀ u′ in L2(R).

Combining the weak lower semicontinuity of the kinetic part K1 with Fatou’s Lemma, we infer

La(u) = ZR(cid:18)1 −q1 − |u′|2 + a(t)W (u)(cid:19) dt ≤ lim inf

n→+∞ La(un) = inf

X1 La.

Furthermore, considering another subsequence if necessary, we may assume that (sn)n converges
to some s ∈ R and that (tn)n converges to some t ∈ R with s ≤ t. In particular, we have

−1 ≤ u(t) ≤ −1 + ε for all t ≤ s

and

by Lemma 3.3, we see that

From the estimate RR W (u) dt ≤ M , we deduce that lim inf
u(t) = ±1,

so that u ∈ X1 and La(u) = min
Step 4. The Euler-Lagrange equation. Finally, thanks to Lemma 3.1 we see that the minimizer
of La is a solution of (1.10). Since limt→±∞ u(t) = ±1 and a(t) is bounded, we deduce from this
equation that limt→±∞ u′(t) exists. Moreover, since u ∈ X1, this limit can only be zero. This

and the bound on ku′kL∞((−M,M )) < 1, for M large enough, given in Lemma 3.1 implies that
ku′kL∞(R) < 1.

(cid:3)

We will be more sketchy for the proof of Theorem 1.3.

Proof of Theorem 1.3. Arguing as in the proof of Theorem 1.2, we prove that a minimizing sequence
(un)n of La satisﬁes properties (i) and (ii) and that the sequence (tn − sn)n is bounded. For each n,
let kn ∈ Z be such that ˆsn = sn + knT ∈ [0, T ). If sn 6∈ [0, T ), replace un with vn(t) = un(t − knT ).
Since a is T -periodic, it is easily seen that La(vn) = La(un). Moreover, vn satisﬁes conditions (i)
and (ii), with sn replaced by ˆsn and tn replaced by ˆtn = tn + knT . Now, the sequence (ˆsn)n ⊂ [0, T )
is clearly bounded and therefore so is (ˆtn)n. The remaining of the proof is then similar.

(cid:3)

3.3. Odd heteroclinics in a symmetric setting. In this last section, we prove Theorem 1.6.
Observe that two of the previous assumptions are now relaxed : a(t) may change sign in a compact
interval and may be unbounded at inﬁnity. Here the new feature that will prevent from losses of
compactness is the monotonicity of the weight a(t).

Proof of Theorem 1.6. We divide again the proof in several steps.

Step 1. A minimizing sequence. We observe that although a(t) may change sign, the functional
LA
a is bounded from below in XA. Indeed, if a(t) takes negative values, assumptions (a2), (a5),
(W ′2) and

0 ≤ W (u) ≤ max

imply that there exists a constant c ≥ 0 such that for all u ∈ XA

LA

0 h1 −q1 − |u′|2 + a(t)W (u)i dt +Z +∞

T

h1 −q1 − |u′|2 + a(t)W (u)i dt ≥ −c.

Fix ε > 0. We will prove that there is a minimizing sequence (un)n ⊂ XA satisfying the following
properties for all n ∈ N0:

(i) un(t) ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0,
(ii) un(t) ≤ 1 for all t ≥ 0, and either

un(t) < 1
or there is an unique sn ≥ T such that
un(t) < 1 for all T ≤ t < sn

(iii) there exists tn ≥ T + 1 such that

and

0 ≤ un(t) < 1 − ε

un(t) > 1 − ε

for all t ≥ T,

and

un(t) = 1 for all t ≥ sn,

for all T + 1 < t < tn

for all t > tn,

see that

(iv) the sequence (tn)n is bounded.
The ﬁrst assertion (i) is clear since LA
Next, let us deﬁne the function vn(t) = inf(cid:0)un(t), 1(cid:1). Arguing as in the proof of Lemma 2.8, we
by assumption (W ′2) and therefore we may replace (un)n by (vn)n. Now, suppose that there is some

Now, suppose that un(T + 1) ≥ 1 − ε. In this case, we set
