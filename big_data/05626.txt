QUIVER GENERALIZATION OF A CONJECTURE OF KING,

TOLLU, AND TOUMAZET

CASS SHERMAN

Abstract. Stretching the parameters of a Littlewood-Richardson coeﬃcient of value
2 by a factor of n results in a coeﬃcient of value n + 1 [KTT04] [Ike12] [She15]. We
give a geometric proof of a generalization for representations of quivers.

1. Introduction

The Littlewood-Richardson coeﬃcients cν

λ,µ arise in the representation theory of the
general linear group. They depend on tuples of nonnegative integers (weights) λ, µ, and
ν. An operation called stretching can be performed in which all of the integers in the
tuples λ, µ, and ν are multiplied by n. The eﬀect of this on the Littlewood-Richardson
coeﬃcient, that is, the function P (n) := cnν
nλ,nµ, has been studied by many. A number
of new and existing conjectures on the behavior of P were summarized by King et
al. [KTT04]. We list some of these below:

• (Polynomiality Conjecture) P is a polynomial.
• (Saturation Conjecture) If P (1) = 0, then P (n) = 0 for all n ≥ 1.
• (Fulton’s Conjecture) If P (1) = 1, then P (n) = 1 for all n ≥ 1.
• (KTT Conjecture) If P (1) = 2, then P (n) = n + 1 for all n ≥ 1.

The polynomiality conjecture was proven by Derksen and Weyman [DW02]. The ﬁrst
(combinatorial) proofs of the saturation and Fulton conjectures are due to Knutson,
Tao, and Woodward [KT99], [KTW04]. Subsequent geometric proofs appeared from
Belkale [Bel06], [Bel07] and others, which allow for an arbitrary number of weights after
symmetrizing. The KTT conjecture was proven combinatorially by Ikenmeyer [Ike12]
for three weights, and geometrically by the author [She15], again symmetrizing and
allowing for an arbitrary number of weights.

For α, β dimension vectors of a cycle-free quiver Q with Ringel product 0, the di-
mensions of the spaces of σβ-semi-invariant functions SI(Q, α)σβ on Rep(Q, α) appear
to exhibit the same behavior under stretching as the Littlewood-Richardson numbers
(see Section 2 for notation and generalities on quiver representations). Thus, one can

make the same assertions for the function eP (n) := dim SI(Q, α)σnβ .

• (Polynomiality) eP is a polynomial.
• (Saturation) If eP (1) = 0, then eP (n) = 0 for all n ≥ 1.
• (Fulton) If eP (1) = 1, then eP (n) = 1 for all n ≥ 1.

All of the above were proven by Derksen and Weyman in the papers [DW02], [DW00],
and [DW11], respectively, with input from Belkale on the last of these. It is well-known

that the results for eP imply those for P , the Littlewood-Richardson numbers coinciding

with dimensions of spaces of semi-invariant functions for special choices of Q, α, β
(see Section 9 for one approach). The main object of this paper is to establish the
corresponding quiver generalization of the KTT Conjecture. That is, we prove:

Theorem 1.1. Let α, β be dimension vectors of Q, a quiver without oriented cycles,
such that hα, βiQ = 0. If dim SI(Q, α)σβ = 2, then dim SI(Q, α)σnβ = n + 1 for all
positive integers n.

Our approach proceeds through geometric invariant theory, following similar proofs
in [Bel07], [She15]. Along the way, we prove by dimension counting a result of general
interest, Proposition 4.1. It has the ﬂavor of results from Schoﬁeld’s paper [Sch92], in
that it equates ExtQ(V, W ) with ExtQ(S, W ), where S is a certain subrepresentation of
V .

In the last section, we show how to deduce the main result of the author’s paper

[She15] (restated as Corollary 9.4 here) from Theorem 1.1.

2. Preliminaries and Notation on Quiver Representations

A quiver Q consists of the data of a pair ﬁnite sets Q0 and Q1 of vertices and arrows
between vertices, respectively, along with maps h, t : Q1 → Q0, where the head map h
associates to each arrow the vertex of its pointer, and the tail map t associates to each
arrow the vertex of its base. We will assume moreover that a quiver has no oriented
cycles when regarded as a digraph.

A dimension vector α is a function α : Q0 → N ∪ {0}. A representation of Q of

dimension vector α is deﬁned to be an element V of the set:

Rep(Q, α) := Ya∈Q1

Hom(Cα(ta), Cα(ha))

We will frequently regard Rep(Q, α) as an aﬃne variety, by the obvious identiﬁcation

with AN for N =Pa α(ta)α(ha).

If V and W are representations of Q of dimension vectors α and β, respectively, then
a morphism φ : V → W of quiver representations is, for each x ∈ Q0, a homomorphism
of vector spaces φ(x) : Cα(x) → Cβ(x), where these must satisfy the commutativity
property φ(ha) ◦ V (a) = W (a) ◦ φ(ta) for every a in Q1. The vector space HomQ(V, W )
of all morphisms of quiver representation is then the kernel of the map

W = ⊕x∈Q0Hom(Cα(x), Cβ(x)) → ⊕a∈Q1Hom(Cα(ta), Cβ(ha))
dV

which sends {φ(x)}x∈Q0 to the element {W (a) ◦ φ(ta) − φ(ha) ◦ V (a)}a∈Q1 .

Let Rep(Q) denote the category with representations of Q (of any dimension vector)
as objects and the above notion of morphism. It is an abelian category. For represen-
tations V and W , one has Ext1(V, W ) = coker(dV
W ), and there is no higher Ext in this
category, so we simply denote this cokernel by ExtQ(V, W ).

The (in general, nonsymmetric) Ringel form on the abelian group of functions Q0 → Z

is the bilinear form:

(1)

hα, βiQ = Xx∈Q0

α(x)β(x) − Xa∈Q1

α(ta)β(ha)

QUIVER GENERALIZATION OF A CONJECTURE OF KING, TOLLU, AND TOUMAZET

It is clear that if moreover α and β are dimension vectors, then hα, βiQ is the diﬀerence
of the dimensions of the domain and codomain of dV

W , whence

(2)

hα, βiQ = dim HomQ(V, W ) − dim ExtQ(V, W )

for any representations V, W of dimensions α, β. In particular, the right hand side of
(2) does not depend on V and W beyond their dimension vectors.

The aﬃne variety Rep(Q, α) has a natural action of

GL(Q, α) := Yx∈Q0

Aut(Cα(x))

given by conjugation: g = (A(x))x sends V = (V (a))a to gV = (A(ha)V (a)A(ta)−1)a.
Let the subgroup SL(Q, α) of GL(Q, α) be the product of the determinant 1 subgroups
of each factor in the product deﬁning GL(Q, α). We are interested in the rings of
semi-invariants

SI(Q, α) = (H 0(Rep(Q, α), O))SL(Q,α),

where O is the structure sheaf. These decompose into direct sums of weight spaces,
called spaces of σ semi-invariants:

SI(Q, α)σ = {f ∈ H 0(Rep(Q, α), O) : g · f = σ(g)f for all g ∈ GL(Q, α)},

for σ a multiplicative character of GL(Q, α). Such a character must be a product over Q0
of integral powers of the determinant characters on each factor of GL(Q, α). A character
σ may therefore be identiﬁed with a function or weight (also called σ) Q0 → Z. Each
such σ deﬁnes a notion of semistability on Rep(Q, α).

Deﬁnition 2.1. Given two weights σ, γ : Q0 → Z, one deﬁnes the evaluation of σ at γ
to be

σ(γ) = Xx∈Q0

σ(x)γ(x).

A representation V of Q which satisﬁes σ(dim V ) = 0 is said to be σ-semistable if for
every nonzero subrepresentation S of V , one has σ(dim S) ≤ 0. The representation V
is σ-stable if the inequality is always strict.

To complete the notation for Theorem 1.1, we introduce the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 2.2. For a dimension vector β of Q, we deﬁne the function σβ : Q0 → Z by

σβ(x) = −β(x) +Pa:ta=x β(ha).

Remark 2.1. Clearly σnβ = nσβ for any positive integer n. Notice also that if α : Q0 → Z
is a function, one has σβ(α) = −hα, βi.

3. Translation via GIT

The goal of this section is to prove Proposition 3.1, which in turn gives Proposition 3.2,
the latter translating the main theorem 1.1 into a form more adaptable to our geometric
approach. Parts of 3.1 are known from the literature (and are credited suitably below),
but the author could not ﬁnd a reference for the descent of the line bundle Lσβ , hence
its full proof here.

4

CASS SHERMAN

Proposition 3.1. Let α, β be dimension vectors for a quiver Q without oriented cycles,
such that hα, βiQ = 0. Let σβ : Q0 → Z be the associated weight (Deﬁnition 2.2). If RSS
denotes the open set of σβ-semistable points of Rep(Q, α), then there is a good quotient
π : RSS → Yα,β, where Yα,β is an integral, projective C-variety with rational singularities
(in particular, is normal). If Lσβ denotes the trivial line bundle Rep(Q, α) × C with
GL(Q, α)-equivariant structure provided by g · (V, z) = (g · V, σβ(g−1)v) (now viewing σβ
as a character, as in section 2), then there exists an ample line bundle LY on Yα,β such
that π∗LY = Lσβ |RSS . Moreover, one has a canonical isomorphism H 0(Yα,β, L⊗n
Y ) =
SI(Q, α)σnβ . It follows from the saturation theorem of Derksen and Weyman [DW00]
that Yα,β = ∅ if and only if SI(Q, α)σβ = 0.

The next proposition paves the way for our geometric proof of Theorem 1.1. It follows

from 3.1 by a simple argument which appears in [She15, Theorem 2.5].

Proposition 3.2. Theorem 1.1 is equivalent to the following statement. If SI(Q, α)σβ
has dimension 2, then Yα,β has dimension 1.

To prove 3.1, we begin with some generalities for a reductive group G acting on the left
on an aﬃne C-variety V = SpecA. Let σ : G → C∗ be a character. Deﬁne a linearization
L of the action of G on V by letting the underlying bundle of L be V × C and deﬁning
the action on L such that g · (v, z) = (gv, σ(g−1)z). Writing L−1 (also a trivial bundle)
as SpecA[x], one obtains from the induced action a rational representation of G on A[x]
by g · (f xn) = (σ(g−n))(f ◦ g−1)xn; here we regard f ∈ A as an algebraic function on
V . Also, one has an action on global sections s : V → L by g · s = g ◦ s ◦ g−1. This
gives rise to a grade-preserving action on R = ⊕∞

n=0H 0(V, L⊗n).

Lemma 3.3. With the above actions, one has a G-equivariant, graded A-algebra iso-
morphism A[x] → R given by sending x to the constant section 1 of L in R1.
Proof. The polynomial f xn goes to the section s : v 7→ (v, f (v)) in Rn. The polynomial
g · (f xn) goes to to the section v 7→ (v, σ(g−n)(f ◦ g−1)(v)), which is g · s.
(cid:3)

Remark 3.1. Since G acts rationally on A[x], by the theorem of Hilbert/Nagata, RG is
a ﬁnitely generated C algebra.

Now, let Q be a quiver without oriented cycles, and ﬁx dimension vectors α, β with
hα, βiQ = 0, and suppose σβ is as in Deﬁnition 2.2. Deﬁne a GL(Q, α)-equivariant line
bundle Lσβ on Rep(Q, α) as above.

Lemma 3.4. For any n ∈ N, we have H 0(Rep(Q, α), L⊗n

σβ )GL(Q,α) = SI(Q, α)σnβ .

Proof. A section f of L⊗n
σβ is simply a regular algebraic function on Rep(Q, α). It is
GL(Q, α) invariant if and only if f (gV ) = (σβ(g−1))nf (V ) for all V, g. This happens if
and only if g−1 · f = σnβ(g−1)f for all g, i.e. if and only if f is a σnβ semi-invariant. (cid:3)

Let Rα,β := ⊕∞

n=0SI(Q, α)σnβ be the homogeneous

n=0H 0(Rep(Q, α), Ln

σβ )GL(Q,α) = ⊕∞

coordinate ring of Yα,β := Proj(Rα,β). Note that

• (Rα,β)0 = C since Q has no oriented cycles [Sch08, Exercise 1.5.1.28].
• Yα,β is a ﬁnite dimensional projective scheme over Spec((Rα,β)0) = SpecC by

Remark 3.1.

• Yα,β is a good quotient of Rep(Q, α)SS
Lσβ

by GL(Q, α) [Kin94]. Thus, Yα,β is

integral with rational singularities (in particular, is normal).

• The notion of Lσβ GIT semistability agrees with the σβ-semistability deﬁned by
= Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS [Kin94, Proposition 3.1].

inequalities; that is, Rep(Q, α)SS
Lσβ

Following closely the proof of Pauly [Pau96, Theorem 3.3] of the analogous fact for
moduli of parabolic bundles, we will now show that the line bundle Lσβ |Rep(Q,α)σβ −SS
descends to an ample line bundle on Yα,β. To do this, we recall the descent lemma
below due to Kempf [DN89, Theorem 2.3].

Lemma 3.5. Let G be a reductive linear algebraic group acting on a C-variety X. Let
f : X → Y be a good quotient of X by G and E a G-equivariant vector bundle on X.
Then E descends to Y if and only if for each closed point x ∈ X whose orbit is closed,
one has that the stabilizer of x in G acts trivially on the ﬁber E|x.

Let V be a σβ-semistable representation whose orbit is closed in Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS.
The stabilizer SV of V in GL(Q, α) is the group of invertible elements of HomQ(V, V ).
If V is stable, then we claim SV = C∗ · Id, by the following simple argument.
If
g : V → V is an automorphism of Q representations, then choosing some x for which
V (x) is nonzero, the isomorphism g(x) : V (x) → V (x) has a nonzero eigenvalue λ.
Thus, g − λ · Id has a nontrivial kernel. By stability of V and general nonsense for
abelian categories with stability structure [Rud97], it follows that g − λ · Id = 0, whence
the claim. The automorphism λ · Id acts on the ﬁber in Lσβ over V by λ to the power

α(x)σβ (x) = hα, βiQ = 0, as desired.

of −Px∈Q0

Now consider the general case where V may not be strictly stable. By [Kin94,
Propostion 3.2], we can assume V is a direct sum of σβ-stable representations V =
m1V1 ⊕ ... ⊕ mtVt which satisfy σβ(dim Vi) = 0. Here Vi is not isomorphic to Vj if
i 6= j. The stabilizer SV of V is the group of invertible elements of HomQ(V, V ), which,
arguing as above via [Rud97], is isomorphic to GL(m1) × ... × GL(mt). Here we identify
GL(m1) × ... × GL(mt) with the subgroup of GL(Q, α) consisting of g such that g(x),
taking an appropriate basis for the direct sum, is represented by a block diagonal matrix
diag(A1(x), ..., At(x)), where Ai(x) is a mi · dim(Vi(x)) × mi · dim(Vi(x)) block matrix,
with m2
i -many scalar matrix blocks of size dim(Vi(x)) × dim(Vi(x)). The scalars that
appear in these blocks do not depend on x ∈ Q0.

multiplication by Qt

Since a 1-dimensional representation of the general linear group must be given by a
power of the determinant, the action of (g1, ..., gt) ∈ SV on the ﬁber of Lσβ over V is
i=1 det(gi)ai for some integers ai. For i = 1, .., t, deﬁne 1-parameter
subgroups hi of SV by hi(λ) = (Id, ..., Id, λ · Id, Id, ..., Id), where the λ appears in the
ith factor. On the one hand, hi acts on Lσβ |V by λmiai. On the other hand, regarding
SV as a subgroup of GL(Q, α) as above, we see that hi acts on Lσβ |V by λyi where

yi = − Xx∈Q0

mi · dim(Vi(x))σβ(x) = −mi · σβ(dim Vi) = 0.

Therefore, ai = 0 for all i = 1, ..., t and SV acts trivially on Lσβ |V , as desired.

4. Useful Inductive Structure

The following proposition allows us to complete the proof of Theorem 1.1 by an
induction argument.
It may be of independent interest outside of this proof. For
example, it can be used to simplify the existing proof of the quiver-generalized Fulton
conjecture [DW11], although we do not do this here.

Proposition 4.1. Fix V ∈ Rep(Q, α). Let UV be a dense open subset of Rep(Q, β)
with the following properties:

i. dim HomQ(V, W ) does not depend on W ∈ UV .
ii. There is a dimension vector γ such that for every W ∈ UV , a dense open subset

of HomQ(V, W ) consists of morphisms φ of rank γ.

Now, ﬁx some W in UV . If φ ∈ HomQ(V, W ) has rank γ and ker φ = S ∈ Rep(Q, α−γ),
then the canonical surjection ExtQ(V, W ) ։ ExtQ(S, W ) is an isomorphism.

Proof. Let

H = {(W ′, φ′) ∈ UV × HomQ(V, W ′) : φ′ has rank γ}

Note that H is an open subset of the total space of a vector bundle over UV , hence
irreducible of dimension

(3)

dim H = dim(Rep(Q, β)) + dim HomQ(V, W ).

Denote by Gr(α − γ, V ) the space of (α − γ)-dimensional subrepresentations of V . Then
we have a map H → Gr(α − γ, V ) which sends (W ′, φ′) to ker φ′. The ﬁber over a point
S′ is an open subset of the space of points (W ′, φ′), where φ′ ∈ HomQ(V /S′, W ′).

H′ over S′ ∈ Gr(α − γ, V ) is given by the open subset of Qx∈Q0

Deﬁne an intermediate space H′ with H → H′ → Gr(α − γ, V ) such that the ﬁber in
Hom((V /S′)(x), Cβ(x))
consisting of φ′ such that φ′(x) is injective for all x. Clearly, H′ → Gr(α − γ, V ) is
smooth (H′ is an open subset of a vector bundle over Gr(α − γ, V )) and

reldim(H′ → Gr(α − γ, V )) = Xx∈Q0

γ(x)β(x).

(4)

(5)

Next observe that the ﬁber in H over (S′, φ′) ∈ H′ is given by the space of all W ′ ∈ UV
such that φ′ is an injective morphism of representations V /S′ → W ′. The condition
imposed on each arrow a in W ′ is that φ′(ha) ◦ (V /S′)(a) = W ′(a) ◦ φ′(ta). Regarding
W ′(a) as a β(ta)×β(ha) matrix with respect to appropriately chosen bases, this equation
determines γ(ta)β(ha) coordinates of W ′(a). Thus, we obtain:

reldim(H → H′) = dim(Rep(Q, β)) − Xa∈Q1

γ(ta)β(ha).

Therefore combining (3), (4), and (5) we obtain:

(6)

dim HomQ(V, W ) ≤ dim(Gr(α − γ, V ) at S) + hγ, βiQ,

where the ﬁrst summand on the right hand side of (6) is the dimension of the largest
irreducible component of Gr(α − γ, V ) passing through the point S. This is at most
the dimension of the scheme-theoretic tangent space to Gr(α − γ, V ) at S, which is
HomQ(S, V /S) [Sch92, Lemma 3.2]. From (6), it now follows that

(7)

dim HomQ(V, W ) ≤ dim HomQ(S, V /S) + hγ, βiQ.

QUIVER GENERALIZATION OF A CONJECTURE OF KING, TOLLU, AND TOUMAZET

7

The given map φ : V → W with kernel S induces an injection HomQ(S, V /S) ֒→
HomQ(S, W ). It follows that

(8)

dim HomQ(V, W ) ≤ dim HomQ(S, W ) + hγ, βiQ.

Since hγ, βi = hα, βi−hα−γ, βi, the inequality (8) can be rewritten as dim ExtQ(V, W ) ≤
dim ExtQ(S, W ). The proof is complete.
(cid:3)

5. Outline of the Proof of Theorem 1.1 by Way of Proposition 3.2

Let Q be a quiver without oriented cycles, α, β dimension vectors with hα, βiQ = 0.
Assume dim SI(Q, α)σβ = 2. By Proposition 3.2, it suﬃces for the proof of Theorem
1.1 to show that dim Yα,β = 1. This will be done by contradiction in Section 7.
If
dim Yα,β ≥ 2, it forces LY to have a base locus. Take an irreducible component of the
inverse image of the base locus in Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS and let Z be its closure in Rep(Q, α).
Now for a general point of (V, W ) of Z × Rep(Q, β), we have HomQ(V, W ) 6= 0 (that is,
the semi-invariant det d(cid:3)

W vanishes at V ). This statement is to be contradicted.

Indeed, the assumption hα, βiQ = 0 ensures that dim HomQ(V, W ) = dim ExtQ(V, W ),
so it suﬃces for the contradiction to show that ExtQ(V, W ) = 0. By Proposition 4.1,
this is equivalent to ExtQ(S, W ) = 0, where S is the kernel of a general morphism
V → W . The tricky part is to show that (S, W ) is generic enough in a closed subset of
Rep(Q, dim S) × Rep(Q, β) to apply 4.1 again. For this, we need a better understanding
of Z. We show that Z is actually the image in Rep(Q, α) of a natural map from a
certain irreducible scheme H∗, constructed in Section 6. The simple description (10)
of H∗ allows us to show that indeed (S, W ) is generic enough for continued applica-
tion of 4.1. After applying 4.1 enough times, using the semistability of V , one ﬁnds a
subrepresentation S′ of S (hence of V ) such that

0 = ExtQ(S′, W ) ∼= ExtQ(S, W ) ∼= ExtQ(V, W ).

This gives our contradiction.

Before proceeding to the detailed proof, we isolate a basic principle from linear algebra
which proves very useful in the work to follow. In fact, we’ve already used it once to
get equation (5).

Basic Principle. Let V1 and V2 be ﬁnite dimensional vector spaces. Given two sub-
spaces i1 : S1 ֒→ V1 and i2 : S2 ֒→ V2 and a morphism φ : S1 → S2, the space of
linear maps ψ : V1 → V2 such that i2 ◦ φ = ψ ◦ i1 is a closed nonempty subvariety of
Hom(V1, V2) isomorphic to AM , where M = dim V1 dim V2 − dim S1 dim V2.

6. Construction of H∗

For dimension vectors α and δ, we will say δ ≤ α if for all x ∈ Q0, δ(x) ≤ α(x).
Choose dimension vectors α, δ, ǫ with ǫ ≤ δ ≤ α. We will ﬁrst construct a smooth,
irreducible scheme
(9) Uα,δ,ǫ = {(V, S, S′, T ) : V ∈ Rep(Q, α), S, S′ ∈ Gr(δ, V ), T = S ∩ S′ ∈ Gr(ǫ, V )}.
To begin the construction, recall from [She15, Appendix A] the space Ar
f,f,g of triples
of subspaces S, S′, T = S ∩ S′ of Cr with dimensions f , f , and g, respectively. It is

8

CASS SHERMAN

shown there that this space is smooth and irreducible. Deﬁne

A1 := Yx∈Q0

Aα(x)

δ(x),δ(x),ǫ(x).

We will denote points in A1 by (S, S′, T ), where S = (S(x))x∈Q0, a collection of δ(x)
dimensional subspaces of Cα(x) and similarly for S′ and T .

For each x in Q0, let T (x) be the appropriate rank ǫ(x) universal subbundle of
OA1 ⊗ Cα(x). Letting a1,...,a|Q1| denote the arrows in Q, form the total space A1
1 of the
bundle Hom(T (ta1), T (ha1)) over A1. Over A1
1 of the bundle
Hom(T (ta2)|A1
). Continue in this fashion until all the arrows are expended.
Call the resulting space A2, which is evidently irreducible and smooth over A1. It can
be described as follows:

1, form the total space A2

, T (ha2)|A1

1

1

A2 = {(S, S′, T, {ϕ(a)}) : (S, S′, T ) ∈ A1 and {ϕ(a)} ∈ Ya∈Q1

Hom(T (ta), T (ha))}.

Now we will attach morphisms to the arrows of S so that T with the arrows {ϕ(a)}
gives a subrepresentation of S with the attached morphisms.

To do this, the idea is to apply the Basic Principle of Section 5 at each point of A2,
once for each arrow in Q1. More formally, let S(x) be the appropriate rank δ(x) univer-
sal subbundle of OA2 ⊗ Cα(x). For each a ∈ Q1, let Φ(a) ∈ HomOA2
(T (ta), T (ha))
be the universal morphism. The inclusion of bundles T (x) → S(x) allows us to
view Φ(a) as a section of the total space of Hom(T (ta), S(ha)). Let A1
2 be the in-
verse image of ImΦ(a1) under the smooth, surjective restriction map of total spaces
Hom(S(ta1), S(ha1)) → Hom(T (ta1), S(ha1)) over A2. Thus, A1
2 is a smooth and sur-
jective over A2 and closed in Hom(S(ta1), S(ha1)). Moreover, since the restriction map
is smooth with irreducible ﬁbers (each isomorphic to an AM as in the Basic Principle),
we have that A1
2, etc. until all arrows are
expended. Repeat the procedure for S′ to ﬁnally obtain

2 is irreducible. Similarly, build A2

2 over A1

A3 = {(S, S′, T, {ϕ(a)}, {ψ(a)}, {ψ′ (a)}) : (S, S′, T, {ϕ(a)}) ∈ A2,

{ψ(a)} ∈ Ya∈Q1

Hom(S(ta), S(ha)), {ψ′(a)} ∈ Ya∈Q1

Hom(S′(ta), S′(ha)),

and ψ(a)|T (ta) = ψ′(a)|T (ta) = ϕ(a) for all a ∈ Q1}.

It is irreducible, surjective, and smooth over A2.

Finally, we construct Uα,δ,ǫ as an irreducible, surjective, and smooth scheme over A3
by a procedure similar to the construction of A3 itself. The idea is to create a scheme A1
3
over A3 whose ﬁber over a point (S, S′, T, {ϕ(a)}, {ψ(a)}, {ψ′ (a)}) is the inverse image
of (ψ(a1), ψ′(a1)) under the restriction Hom(Cα(ta1), Cα(ha1)) to Hom(S(ta1), Cα(ha1)) ⊕
Hom(S′(ta1), Cα(ha1)). Because ψ(a1), ψ′(a1) restrict to the same morphism on T (ta1),
this ﬁber is irreducible of dimension independent of the point of A3. Hence A1
3 is
irreducible, surjective, and smooth over A3. As above, build an appropriate scheme A2
3
over A1

3, and so on, until the desired Uα,δ,ǫ is reached.

(10) Hα,β,δ,ǫ = {(V, W, W ′, φ, φ′) : V ∈ Rep(Q, α), W, W ′ ∈ Rep(Q, β),

φ ∈ HomQ(V, W ), φ′ ∈ HomQ(V, W ′),

ker φ, ker φ′ ∈ Gr(δ, V ), (ker φ) ∩ (ker φ′) ∈ Gr(ǫ, V )}

This can be constructed as an irreducible, smooth scheme over Uα,δ,ǫ as follows. Letting
V(x), S(x), and S ′(x) denote the appropriate universal bundles on U∗ for x ∈ Q0, form
the total space of the bundle

(Hom((V/S)(x), Cβ(x) ⊗ O) × Hom((V/S ′)(x), Cβ(x) ⊗ O)).

Yx∈Q0

A point of this total space over (V, S, S′, T ) ∈ U∗ is given by ﬁnite collections of linear
maps {φ(x) : V /S(x) → Cβ(x)} and {φ′(x) : V /S′(x) → Cβ(x)}. Let H′
α,β,δǫ denote the
open locus of the total space where each of these linear maps is injective. It is clearly
irreducible, surjective , and smooth over U∗. We build an irreducible H∗ smoothly over
∗ by attaching spaces of maps Cβ(ta) → Cβ(ha), so that {φ(x)} and {φ′(x)} become
H′
morphisms of representations.

To do this, the idea is again repeat applications of the Basic Principle with, for
each arrow a, the vectors spaces “V1,” “V2,” “S1,” and “S2” given by Cβ(ta), Cβ(ha),
(V /S)(ta), and (V /S)(ha) respectively, and “φ” given by (V /S)(a) (and similarly with
S′ in place of S). The formal argument mirrors the construction of A3 over A2.

We proceed by contradiction via Proposition 3.2. That is, we suppose

7. Proof of Theorem 1.1

2 = dim SI(Q, α)σβ ,

and we assume to the contrary that dim Yα,β ≥ 2. Recall from Proposition 3.1 the ample
line bundle LY on Y . Let Z ⊆ Rep(Q, α) be the closure of an irreducible component
of the preimage of the base locus of LY . This base locus is nonempty by the dimension
assumption on Y . For a general element (W, W ′) ∈ Rep(Q, β)×2, the semi-invariants
W ′ form a basis for SI(Q, α)σβ = H 0(Y, LY ) (see Section 2 and [DW11,
det d(cid:3)
Section 2]). In particular, it follows that for a general element (V, W ) ∈ Z × Rep(Q, β),
one has:

W , det d(cid:3)

(11)

HomQ(V, W ) 6= 0,

i.e. dV
W is noninjective. Let δ < α be the dimension vector of the kernel of a gen-
eral morphism of quiver representations V → W , equivalently such a morphism has
rank γ := α − δ. Also let ǫ be a dimension vector such that given a general ele-
ment (V, W, W ′) ∈ Z × Rep(Q, β)×2 and general pair of quiver morphisms (φ, φ′) ∈
HomQ(V, W ) × HomQ(V, W ′), the intersection of ker φ and ker φ′ has dimension ǫ.

Constructed in Section 6, we have the irreducible smooth scheme Hα,β,δ,ǫ, whose

closed points are given by (V, W, W ′, φ, φ′) which satisfy:

V ∈ Rep(Q, α), W, W ′ ∈ Rep(Q, β), φ ∈ HomQ(V, W ), φ′ ∈ HomQ(V, W ′),

ker φ, ker φ′ ∈ Gr(δ, V ), (ker φ) ∩ (ker φ′) ∈ Gr(ǫ, V ).

CASS SHERMAN

This scheme controls the base locus Z in the sense of the following proposition, whose
proof is virtually identical to [She15, Proposition 5.2].

Lemma 7.1. The morphism
(12) Hα,β,δ,ǫ → Rep(Q, α) × Rep(Q, β) × Rep(Q, β) : (V, W, W ′, φ, φ′) 7→ (V, W, W ′)
factors through a dominant map pr to Z × Rep(Q, β) × Rep(Q, β).

−−−→ V

Now, there is an irreducible space Zδ,ǫ describing all pairs (S, T ) consisting of a δ-
dimensional representation S of Q with an ǫ-dimensional subrepresentation T ֒→ S
(to see this, note that Zδ,ǫ is a ﬁber bundle over Rep(Q, ǫ)). Fix (S, T, W ) a general
element of Zδ,ǫ × Rep(Q, β). Since W is general, it follows from Lemma 7.1 that W
φ
has a γ-dimensional subrepsentation W ′ (which is the image of V
−→ W for some V
in Z), and W ′ has a (δ − ǫ)-dimensional subrepresentation W ′′ (which is the image
of S′ ker φ′
φ
−→ W ). Let V0 := S ⊕ W ′ (an α-dimensional representation) and let
φ0 : V0 → W be the obvious map which has rank γ and kernel S. Observe that
S′ := T ⊕ W ′′ is a second δ-dimensional subrepresentation of V0 which intersects S in
the ǫ-dimensional representation T . Therefore, (V0, S, S′, T ) ∈ Uα,δ,ǫ. By the Basic
Principle of Section 5, one can construct a β-dimensional representation W ′ and a
morphism φ′
0) is a point of Hα,β,δ,ǫ,
where (S = ker φ0, T = (ker φ0 ∩ ker φ′
0), W ) is a general element of Zδ,ǫ × Rep(Q, β).
Thus, Hα,β,δ,ǫ dominates Zδ,ǫ × Rep(Q, β), and we have the Lemma below.
Lemma 7.2. Let (V, W, W ′, φ, φ′) be a general element of Hα,β,δ,ǫ, with S := ker φ,
S′ := ker φ′, T := S ∩ S′. Then (S, T, W ) is a general element of Zδ,ǫ × Rep(Q, β) (e.g.
the pair (S, W ) is suitable for application of Proposition 4.1).

0 : V0 → W ′ with kernel S′. Thus, (V0, W, W ′, φ0, φ′

Now take a general element of (V, W, W ′, φ, φ′) ∈ Hα,β,δ,ǫ with S := ker φ, S′ := ker φ′,

T := S ∩ S′. The above discussion shows that we may assume:

i. V is σβ-semistable.
ii. (V, W ) is a general element of Z × Rep(Q, β).
iii. (S, T, W ) is a general element of Zδ,ǫ × Rep(Q, β).

By ii and Proposition 4.1, we have ExtQ(V, W ) ∼= ExtQ(S, W ). By i, every subrepresen-
tation R of S satisﬁes hdim R, βi ≥ 0. By iii, we may apply Proposition 8.1 to (S, T, W )
and conclude that ExtQ(V, W ) = 0. Hence,

(13)

dim HomQ(V, W ) = hα, βiQ + dim ExtQ(V, W ) = 0 + 0

This contradicts (11).

8. Vanishing of Ext for S

We now ignore the previous context and prove Proposition 8.1 independent of the
foregoing discussion. Let ǫ ≤ δ be dimension vectors. Let Zδ,ǫ be the irreducible space
consisting of a δ-dimensional representation S with an ǫ-dimensional subrepresentation
T . The following is a variant of [DW00, Theorem 3] (see also [She15, Proposition 6.2]).

Proposition 8.1. Suppose (S0, T0, W0) ∈ Zδ,ǫ×Rep(Q, β) is a general element. Suppose
moreover that every subrepresentation R of S0 satisﬁes the inequality hdim R, βi ≥ 0.
Then ExtQ(S0, W0) = 0.

QUIVER GENERALIZATION OF A CONJECTURE OF KING, TOLLU, AND TOUMAZET

11

Proof. We proceed by induction on the number Mδ := Px∈Q0

δ(x). If Mδ = 0, then
the conclusion holds trivially. Assume Mδ ≥ 1. Let ˜δ ≤ δ be a dimension vector such
that if (S, T, W ) is a general point of Zδ,ǫ × Rep(Q, β), then a general morphism of
representations ψ : S → W has kernel of dimension ˜δ.
If ˜δ = δ, then for a general
(S, T, W ), one has HomQ(S, W ) = 0. On the other hand, by assumption

0 ≤ hδ, βi = dim HomQ(S0, W0) − dim ExtQ(S0, W0),

so the conclusion follows in this case. We may as well assume then that M˜δ < Mδ.

Suppose also that for a general (S, T, W ), the ˜δ-dimensional kernel ˜S of a general
morphism ψ : S → W meets T in an ˜ǫ-dimensional subreprsentation ˜T . Let Uδ,ǫ,˜δ,˜ǫ
be the irreducible smooth scheme whose points are (S, T, ˜S, ˜T ) of the corresponding
dimensions such that S ⊇ T , S ⊇ ˜S, and ˜T = T ∩ ˜S (the construction is identical to
that of Section 6). Build over Uδ,ǫ,˜δ,˜ǫ the smooth, irreducible scheme Hδ,β,ǫ,˜δ,˜ǫ whose
ﬁber over (S, T, ˜S, ˜T ) is the space of (W, ψ) where W is a β-dimensional representation
and ψ : S → W has kernel ˜S. By choice of ˜δ, ˜ǫ, the map π : Hδ,β,ǫ,˜δ,˜ǫ → Zδ,ǫ × Rep(Q, β)
is dominant.

Let ( ˜S, ˜T , W ) be a general element of Z˜δ,˜ǫ×Rep(Q, β). Since W is general, it possesses
a (δ − ˜δ)-dimensional subrepresentation W ′, which in turn has a (ǫ − ˜ǫ)-dimensional
subrepresentation W ′′ (see the argument preceding Lemma 7.2). Now consider S :=
˜S ⊕ W ′ and the obvious morphism ψ : S → W with kernel S and rank δ − ˜δ.
If
T := ˜T ⊕ W ′′, then (S, T, ˜S, ˜T , W, ψ) is an element of Hδ,β,ǫ,˜δ,˜ǫ. Since ( ˜S, ˜T , W ) is
generic, this proves the map ˜π : Hδ,β,ǫ,˜δ,˜ǫ → Z˜δ,˜ǫ × Rep(Q, β) is also dominant.
In
particular, if ψ0 is a general element of the ﬁber in Hδ,β,ǫ,˜δ,˜ǫ over the general element
(S0, T0, W0), we can assume that the induced element ( ˜S0 := ker ψ0, ˜T0 := ˜S0 ∩ T0, W0)
of Z˜δ,˜ǫ × Rep(Q, β) is generic.

Now by Proposition 4.1, ExtQ(S0, W0) ∼= ExtQ( ˜S0, W ). Clearly every subrepresenta-
tion of ˜S0, being also a subrepresentation of S0, satisﬁes the appropriate inequality. By
genericity of ( ˜S0, ˜T0, W0), the inductive hypothesis now completes the proof.
(cid:3)

9. Connection to Invariants of Tensor Products

We now show how Theorem 1.1 gives the main theorem of [She15] as a corollary.
Indeed, the relationship between semi-invariants of so-called triple ﬂag quivers and SLr
invariants of three-fold tensor products is well-known [DW00, Section 3 Proposition
1]. We prove a geometric generalization, namely that the polarized moduli space of
semistable representations is isomorphic to the polarized moduli space of semistable
parabolic vector spaces, where in both cases semistability is determined by given Young
diagrams λ1, ..., λs.

For p = 1, ..., s with s ≥ 3, let λp be a partition with at most r − 1 nonzero parts and
no part greater than ℓ. Assume also the partitions satisfy the “codimension condition:”

Note that there must be some such ℓ if the tensor product corresponding to λ1, ..., λs is
to have invariants.

Let 0 < δp

pullback of the ample generator of Pic(Gr(δp
from X p [Bri05]. Each Li has a canonical SLr-equivariant structure compatible with
the usual SLr action on X p, so that every line bundle on X p obtains such a structure.
In the sequel, we will take this equivariant structure as implicit.

i=1

With the above description of Pic(X p), one has an SLr-equivariant line bundle

˜Lλ =

sYp=1

(b(λp)1, ..., b(λp)C(λp))

on X := Qs

There is an integral, projective good quotient ρ : X SS → Mλ for the action of SLr,
where Mλ has rational singularities. The line bundle ˜Lλ descends to an ample line
bundle Lλ on Mλ. Moreover, one has a natural isomorphism for each positive integer
n:

H 0(Mλ, L⊗n

λ ) = (V ∗

nλ1 ⊗ ... ⊗ V ∗

nλs)SLr .

See [She15, Section 2] for a summary with appropriate references.

We saw similarly in Section 3 that for a cycle-free quiver Q and dimension vectors α, β
of Q, one has a moduli space with an ample line bundle (Yα,β, LY ), where sections of
tensor powers of LY give σβ semi-invariants of Rep(Q, α). The goal now is to show that
for the right of choice of Q, α, β, the polarized moduli spaces (Yα,β, LY ) and (Mλ, Lλ)
are actually the same. To this end, let Q be the s-partial ﬂag quiver of vertices labeled
1p, 2p, ..., C(λp)p for p = 1, ..., s and one additional vertex r = (C(λ1) + 1)1 = ... =
(C(λs) + 1)s, with arrows ip → (i + 1)p for all p = 1, ..., s and i = 1, ..., C(λp). Let α be
the dimension vector given by α(ip) = δp
i and α(r) = r. For example, if r = 4, ℓ = 5,

(14). As in Section 2, we have an associated weight σβ, given in this case by σβ(ip) =

Let β be the dimension vector β(ip) = ℓ −PC(λp)

Lemma 9.1. The map f is a geometric quotient of Rep(Q, α)inj by G × {Id}.

Proof. The case s = 1, X = Gr(a, Cr) is standard (see e.g. [Muk03, Section 8.1]). The
general case proceeds much the same way. Linearize the action of G×{Id} on Rep(Q, α)

by the character which takes (gx)x∈Q0−{r} to Qx∈Q0−{r} det(gx). It is easy to see that

with respect to this linearization, we have Rep(Q, α)SS = Rep(Q, α)S = Rep(Q, α)inj.
Therefore, one has a geometric quotient Y of Rep(Q, α)inj. Clearly f is constant on
G × {Id} orbits, so f descends to ˜f on the geometric quotient of Rep(Q, α)inj. Now
˜f is surjective (because f is), and ˜f is injective by the following simple argument. If
p=1(φp
r−1) have the same image in X, then in
particular, φp
r−1 ∈ GLr−1 such
that φ′p
r−1 = φp
r−2 deﬁned
likewise, whence there is gp

this out and canceling φp

Continuing in this fashion, we see that φ and φ′ are in the same orbit. By Zariski’s
main theorem, ˜f is an isomorphism.
(cid:3)

r−1 have the same image in Cr. Thus, there is a gp

Now consider a σβ-semistable point φ ∈ Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS. If for some 1 ≤ i0 ≤ r − 1,
p0
1 ≤ p0 ≤ s, the component φp0

i0
then φ has a subrepresentation of dimension vector (dim ψ)(ip) = 0 for ip 6= ip0
0 and

(dim ψ)(ip0
i0 which sends 1 to v. In this case we
have σβ(dim ψ) = b(λp0)i0, which is strictly positive, violating semistability of φ. Thus,
Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS ⊆ Rep(Q, α)inj. Now an easy calculation comparing the inequalities
(15) to those of σβ-semistability shows that f −1(X SS ) = Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS. Therefore,
by Lemma 9.1, the variety X SS is the good quotient Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS//(G×{Id}). Since

CASS SHERMAN

a morphism from Rep(Q, α) is GL(Q, α) invariant if and only if it is G × SLr invariant,
one has:

Yα,β = Rep(Q, α)σβ −SS//(G × SLr) = (X SS)//SLr = Mλ.

It now remains to prove that the line Lλ and LY agree under this identiﬁcation. We

will need some lemmas.

Lemma 9.2. A section s in H 0(Rep(Q, α), Lσβ ) is GL(Q, α) invariant if and only if it
is G × SLr invariant.

Proof. Necessity is immediate. For suﬃciency, suppose ¯g ∈ GL(Q, α). We may write

this element as ¯g =(cid:16)×s
p=1 ×C(λp)

¯g1 =(cid:16)×s

so that ¯g = ¯g1 · ¯g2. Since ¯g2 ∈ G × SLr and ¯g1 acts trivially on sections of Lσβ (by (14)),
if s is G × SLr invariant, we have ¯g · s = s, as desired.
(cid:3)

Lemma 9.3. Let 0 < δ1 < ... < δC < r be integers, let

H = Hom(Cδ1, Cδ2) × ... × Hom(CδC−1, CδC ) × Hom(CδC , Cr),

conjugation action of G × SLr where G := QC

and Hinj the locus where φ1, ..., φC are all injective. Observe that Hinj has a natural
i=1 Aut(Cδi). For i = 1, ..., C, let G act
trivially on Gr(δi, Cr) and its ample generator O(1), and let SLr act in the usual way on
both of these. If fi : Hinj → Gr(δi, Cr) is the G×SLr-equivariant map sending (φ1, ..., φC )
to Im(φC ◦...◦φi), then the pullback along fi of O(1) is G ×SLr equivariantly isomorphic
to Li on Hinj. Here we denote by Li the G × SLr equivariant bundle whose underlying
bundle is trivial and whose action is given by g · (φ, z) = (g · φ, (det gi)−1z).

Proof. Let Si be the universal subbundle on Gr(δi, Cr), endowed with an equivariant
structure by allowing G to act trivially and SLr to act in the obvious way. Endow also
the trivial rank i bundle Hinj×Ci with the action g·(φ, v) = (g·φ, giv). One has a G×SLr
equivariant isomorphism ρ : Hinj × Ci → f ∗Si which sends (φ, v) to (φC ◦ ... ◦ φi)(v) in
S|fi(φ). Thus, det ρ is a G × SLr equivariant isomorphism of Hinj × C (action given by
g · (φ, z) = (g · φ, (det gi)z)) with f ∗
(cid:3)

i O(−1). The assertion follows.

From Lemma 9.3, one deduces f ∗ ˜L⊗n
λ

is G × SLr equivariantly isomorphic to L⊗n
σβ .

Thus, using 9.2 in the ﬁrst step below, we have:

(16) H 0(Yα,β, L⊗n

σβ )G×SLr
= H 0(X SS, ˜L⊗n

λ )SLr = H 0(Mλ, L⊗n
λ ).

It follows that LY = Lλ.

Corollary 9.4. [She15] If dim(V ∗

λ1 ⊗ ... ⊗ V ∗

λs)SLr = 2, then dim(V ∗

side is (V ∗
