Abstract. The two-photon quantum Rabi model with quadratic coupling is studied
using extended squeezed states and we derive G-functions for Bargmann index q = 1/4
and 3/4. The simple singularity structure of the G-function allows to draw conclusions
about the distribution of eigenvalues along the real axis. The previously found picture
of the spectral collapse at critical coupling gc has to be modiﬁed regarding the low
lying states, especially the ground state: We obtain a ﬁnite gap between ground state
and the continuum of excited states at the collapse point. For large qubit splitting, also
other low lying states may be separated from the continuum at gc. We have carried
out a perturbative analysis allowing for explicit and simple formulae of the eigenstates.
Interestingly, a vanishing of the gap between ground state and excited continuum at
gc is obtained in each ﬁnite order of approximation. This demonstrates cleary the
non-pertubative nature of the excitation gap. We corroborate these ﬁndings with a
variational calculation for the ground state.

1. Introduction

The quantum Rabi model (QRM), a major paradigm for light-matter interaction since its
inception in 1936 [1], has drawn persistent attention due to its applications in numerous
ﬁelds ranging from quantum optics to condensed matter physics and even, very recently,
to quantum information science. It describes a two-level system (qubit) coupled linearly
to a cavity electromagnetic mode [1, 2]. The Hamiltonian can be written as

HR =

Ω
2

σz + ωa†a + g(a† + a)σx,

(1)

where σx,z are Pauli matrices describing the two-level system and a (a†) are the
annihilation (creation) bosonic operators of the cavity mode. Although it appears to be
much simpler than the hydrogen atom, it has been considered unsolvable for a long time.
Recently, by using Bargmann-space methods [4], it was shown that this model is not only
exactly solvable but also integrable [5]. The so-called regular spectrum can be obtained
by zeros of a function GR(E), i.e. GR(En) = 0 entails En ∈ spec(HR). This G-function
can be written explicitly in terms of conﬂuent Heun functions [6]. GR(E) was then
recovered within the extended coherent states approach, which avoids the mapping into
the Bargmann space of analytic functions [7]. These results have stimulated extensive
research in the QRM and related models [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
On the other hand, the two-photon QRM has also attracted a lot of attention.
It couples the two-level system to the cavity mode non-linearly and describes a three-
level system when the third state can be adiabatically eliminated. It may be realized for
Rydberg atoms in microwave superconducting cavities [21, 22] and quantum dots [23, 24]
. The two-photon QRM has also been studied for a long time both with the RWA [25]
and beyond the RWA [26, 27, 28]. Recently, a realistic implementation of two-photon
quantum Rabi models using trapped ions has been proposed [29], which could reach the
coupling region corresponding to the interaction-induced spectral collapse. This feature
can only be observed in the deep strong coupling regime of the quantum Rabi model [30]
and resembles in this respect the well-known superradiant phase transition of the Dicke
model [31].

2. Exact solution using the SU (1, 1) algebraic structure

The Hamiltonian of the two-photon QRM is given by

H = −

Ω
2

(2)

σx + a†a + gh(cid:0)a†(cid:1)2

+ a2i σz,

where Ω is the qubit splitting, a† (a) is the photonic creation (annihilation) operator
of the single-mode cavity with frequency ω = 1. We have used the “spin-boson”
representation [32], exchanging σx and σz. The interaction part is quadratic in the
boson operators, while in the original QRM it is linear (see (1)).

In this section we derive the G-function found previously for this model [7] in a

more concise and compact way. First, we perform a Bogoliubov transformation

b = ua + va†,

b† = ua† + va,

to a new bosonic operators. With

u =s 1 + β

2β

,

v =s1 − β

and β =p1 − 4g2, the upper diagonal matrix element of the Hamiltonian becomes

b†b − v2
u2 + v2

.

In terms of b, b†, the Hamiltonian reads

H11 = a†a + gh(cid:0)a†(cid:1)2
H =  b†b−v2

with

H22 =(cid:0)u2 + v2 + 4guv(cid:1) b†b − 2uvh(cid:0)b†(cid:1)2

+ b2i + 2guv + v2.

The operators b†b, (b†)2, b2 provide a representation of the non-compact Lie algebra
su(1, 1): With

K0 =

we have

[K0, K±] = ±K±,

[K+, K−] = −2K0.

The quadratic Casimir operator C of the algebra is given by

C = K+K− − K0 (K0 − 1) .

The inﬁnite-dimensional unitary representations of su(1, 1) are labeled by the value q
of C, the Bargmann index. Here, the Hilbert space H generated by b† on the state |0ib

anihilated by b, separates into two H-invariant subspaces, H = H 1

where Π = ±1, corresponding to positive(negative) parity. So far, we have just re-
derived the G-function in a more compact and concise way compared to [7]

We plot the two-photon G-function in ﬁgure 1 for Ω = 1, two values of g, 0.25 and
4. The zeros give the location of the energy

0.45, and both Bargmann indices q = 1

3. Spectral collapse and energy gap

The energy of the ground state does not tend to − 1
2, in sharp contrast with
almost all of the excited states. This is seen in all previous numerical calculations of the
spectra, but has never been discussed in detail. Here, we will present an explanation
with help of the analytical exact solutions.

and the zeroth baseline is crossed. This is possible if the exceptional solution is not

Juddian (doubly-degenerate) [32, 33, 34]. We shall see that also the opposite occurs:
an energy level above the ﬁrst pole for small g crosses the zeroth baseline at g0 and
lies below the ﬁrst pole for g > g0. These levels correspond to zeros of the G−function
which are not pinched between the poles as g approaches gc = 1
2 and will therefore not
collapse into the continuum.

The ground state belongs to negative parity for each q and does not cross the zeroth
baseline for the examples in ﬁgure 2. It will always be separated by a ﬁnite gap from
the continuum at g = 1
2. For large Ω = 3, we have in the lower panels of ﬁgure 2 an
example of an excited state with positive parity crossing the zeroth baseline at g0 < gc.
This state will also not collapse as g = 1
2 is reached. Because several eigenstates for
each parity are located below the ﬁrst pole for small g according to 18, and correspond
to zeros of the G-function in a pole-free region, none of them is constrained by the
argument above and may be separated from the continuum at the critical coupling, if
they do not cross the zeroth baseline for some g < gc.

m for positive parity and odd m for negative parity. It follows Π (−1)m = 1. Therefore,
we may replace Π by (−1)m and obtain for the eigenenergies of the excited states

are 2 (N + 1) solutions for each value of m.

The energy levels in zeroth order and ﬁrst order approximation are also presented
in ﬁgure 2 (Ω = 1, upper level). The energy levels agree even in the zero order
approximation quite well with the exact ones.
Interestingly, the spectral collapse is
exhibited already in zeroth order. This is not strange, because the matrix elements
Dmn in (23) tends to zero if g approaches 1
2 . Actually in any order of the analytic
approximation, the energy for all eigenstates approaches − 1
2 , including the ground state,
leading to a complete collapse. This is not true, as shown in section 3. The ﬁnite order
approximations break down for all N when the critical point g = 1
2 is approached. In
the following section, we perform a variational analysis of the ground state to show this
in an alternative way.

where Ntr is truncation number. The lowest energy obtained from the above eigenvalue
problem will give the ground-state energy E(Ntr)
in the Ntr-th order of approximation.

GScorresponds to Ntr = 1.

GS

We plot the GS energy as a function of coupling strength in diﬀerent order of
approximations for Ω = 1, in ﬁgure 3. The GS energy becomes closer to the exact one
as the approximation order increases, but it tends to the collapse value − 1
2 ﬁnally as
g goes to 1
2 in any ﬁnite order approximation. This holds as well for all states below
the continuum discussed in section 3. It indicates that any ﬁnite order approximation
misses the low energy features of the spectrum at the critical coupling.

We elucidate this ﬁnding by performing a variational study for the ground-state

with negative parity. The trial wavefunction reads for Π = −1, q = 1

Minimizing E(r) with respect to r gives a variational estimate for the ground-state
energy.

In ﬁgure 4, we compare the GS energies obtained by the above variational ansatz
with those of the ﬁrst-order approximation and the exact G-function technique.
It
is found that the variational GS energy is much better than obtained in the ﬁrst-
order approximation. More interestingly, the variational GS energy does not collapse
towards − 1
2. This proves that the lower edge of the continuum cannot coincide with the
groundstate of the system which is always gapped.

6. Conclusions

2, this level will collapse to the value − 1

In this work, we have derived the G-function for the two-photon QRM in a concise and
compact way, by using extended squeezed states for each Bargmann index. Zeros of the
G-function determine the regular spectrum. The average distance between energy levels
is dictated by the pole structure of G(E). If the n-th level for any ﬁnite n is located
between two poles as g tends to 1
2. The
ground state is located below the ﬁrst pole for g ≪ 1 and remains so until gc is reached.
However, a crossing of the zeroth baseline from below cannot be ruled out, because
non-degenerate exceptional solutions are possible for n = 0. It seems that these always
belong to excited states with positive parity and large Ω: the zeroth baseline is crossed
from above so that this state lies in the gap between ground state and continuum at
g = gc. In general the G-function has several zeros below E = − 1
2 for large Ω and small
g. All of them seem to remain separated from the continuum at the collapse point.
We have calculated explicit solutions in a ﬁnite-dimensional approximation scheme and
found that the zeroth order describes the collapse well but the gap and the discrete levels
inside do not appear in any ﬁnite order approximation. Nevertheless, the existence of
the gap itself can be proven by a simple variational analysis of the ground state.
