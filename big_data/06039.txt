We present a detailed study of the static spherically symmetric solutions in de Rham-Gabadadze-
Tolley (dRGT) theory. Since the diﬀeomorphism invariance can be restored by introducing the
St¨uckelberg ﬁelds φa, there is new invariant I ab = gµν ∂µφa∂ν φb in the massive gravity, which adds
to the ones usually encountered in general relativity (GR). In the unitary gauge φa = xµδa
µ, any
inverse metric gµν that has divergence including the coordinate singularity in GR would exhibit
a singularity in the invariant I ab. Therefore, there is no conventional Schwarzschild metric if we
choose unitary gauge. In this paper, we obtain a self-consistent static spherically symmetric ansatz
in the nonunitary gauge. Under this ansatz, we ﬁnd that there are seven solutions including the
Schwarzschild solution, Reissner-Nordstr¨om solution and ﬁve other solutions. These solutions may
possess an event horizon depending upon the physical parameters (Schwarzschild radius rs, scalar
charge S and/or electric charge Q). If these solutions possess an event horizon, we show that the
singularity of I ab is absent at the horizon. Therefore, these solutions may become candidates for
black holes in dRGT.

INTRODUCTION

2

It is an interesting question whether general relativity (GR) is a solitary theory from both the theoretical and
phenomenological sides. One of the modifying gravity theories is the massive deformation of GR. A comprehensive
review of massive gravity can be found in [1]. We can divide the massive gravity theories into two varieties: the Lorentz
invariant type (LI) and the Lorentz breaking type (LB). Though for many years it was certain that the theory of LI
massive gravity always contains the Boulware-Deser (BD) ghosts [2], a kind of its nonlinear extension was recently
constructed by de Rham, Gabadadze, and Tolley (dRGT) [3–6]. In GR, the spherically symmetric vacuum solution
to the Einstein equation is a benchmark, and its massive deformation also plays a crucial role in massive gravity.
A detailed study of the spherically symmetric solutions is presented in LB massive gravity [7]. dRGT theory also
contains a vacuum solution that recovers exactly a Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution [8–10] in a group of specially
selected parameters. They concentrate on a special family of dRGT theory in which there is the following relation
between the two free parameters: 9α2
3 + 3α3− 12α4 + 1 = 0. This choice was ﬁrst shown by Nieuwenhuizen [8] (see also
[11]). According to the method of Koyama, Niz and Tasinato [9], one can start in the unitary gauge φa = xµδa
µ, and
consider a most general stationary spherically symmetric metric. The resulting metric is the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
solution in the Gullstrand-Painlev´e coordinates [10]. This metric can be transformed to a static slicing by a suitable
coordinate transformation, in which the metric is accompanied by nontrivial backgrounds for the St¨uckelberg ﬁelds
[10]. Other analyses and phenomenological studies were discussed in Refs. [12–17] for the black holes and spherically
symmetric solutions in dRGT.

The symmetric tensor ﬁeld hµν ≡ gµν − ηµν is the gravitational analogue to the Proca ﬁeld in the massive elec-
trodynamics, describing all ﬁve modes of the massive graviton. The diﬀeomorphism invariance can be restored by
introducing the four St¨uckelberg ﬁelds [18] and replacing the Minkowski metric by the covariant tensor ∂µφa∂ν φbηab,
then the symmetric tensor Hµν describes the covariantized metric perturbation. In the unitary gauge, Hµν reduces
to hµν. There is a new basic invariant I ab = gµν∂µφa∂νφb in the massive gravity in addition to the ones usually
encountered in GR since the existence of the four scalar ﬁelds φa. In the unitary gauge, we have I ab = gµνδa
ν. It
is obvious that I ab will exhibit a singularity if gµν has any divergence including the coordinate singularity for the
unitary gauge. De Rham and his colleagues [10] have pointed out that one would expect the singularities in I ab to
be a problem for ﬂuctuations around classical solutions exhibiting it. For this reason, they propose that the solution
comes true only if I ab is nonsingular. In this paper, we continue to use this conservative rule.

µδb

As a corollary of the above point of view, there is no conventional Schwarzschild metric of massive gravity in unitary
gauge, which gives rise to the following paradox. According to the vainshtein mechanism [19], this solution of massive
gravity should approximate one of GR better and better when we increase the mass of the source. That is to say,
this black hole of massive gravity near its horizon should be very similar to that of GR. However, this metric would
be singular at the horizon according to the argument above. Whether or not there is the conventional Schwarzschild
solution in dRGT with two free parameters is one of the questions that motivates this paper.

In this work, we discuss the black holes and static spherically symmetric solutions in dRGT, where two parameters
are freely chosen. Furthermore, we release from the limitations of the unitary gauge φa = xµδa
µ, and the St¨uckelberg
ﬁeld φi is taken as a ”hedgehog” conﬁguration φi = φ(r) xi
r and φ0 = t + h(r) [7]. We have found a wide class
of static spherically symmetric solutions including the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner-Nordstr¨om solution, the
furry black hole solution and some new solutions. On the obtained solutions the singularities in the invariant I ab are
absent except for the physical singularity r = 0, so that these solutions may be regarded as candidates for modiﬁed
black holes in dRGT.

The paper is organized as follows: Sec.

In Sec.

III, we present a
self-consistent static spherically symmetric ansatz with a nonunitary gauge. In Sec. IV, we ﬁnd the Schwarzschild
solution and two other solutions depending upon the parameters rs and S, and in Sec. V the Reissner-Nordstr¨om
solution and three other solutions depending upon the parameters rs, Q and/or S. Moreover, the obtained solutions
have nonsingular I ab. In Appendix A, we give the expression of I ab under the self-consistent ansatz, and show the
obtained solutions in which the singularities in the invariant I ab are absent except the physical singularity r = 0.

II gives a brief review of dRGT theory [6].

II. THE MODIFIED EINSTEIN EQUATIONS IN DRGT THEORY

The gravitational action is

S =

M 2
pl

2 Z d4x√−g[R + m2U (g, φa)],

(1)

where R is the Ricci scalar, and U is a potential for the graviton which modiﬁes the gravitational sector. The potential
is composed of three parts,

3

where α3 and α4 are dimensionless parameters, and

U (g, φa) = U2 + α3U3 + α4U4,

U2 = [K]2 − [K2],
U3 = [K]3 − 3[K][K2] + 2[K3],
U4 = [K]4 − 6[K]2[K2] + 8[K][K3] + 3[K2]2 − 6[K4].

Here the square brackets denote the traces, i. e., [K] = Kµ

µ and

The symmetric tensor Hµν describes the covariantized metric perturbation, which reduces to the hµν in the unitary
gauge. Therefore, it is natural to split φa into two parts: φa = xa − πa and πa = 0 in the unitary gauge. It is useful
that we adopt the following decomposition in the nonunitary gauge,

πa =

mAa + ∂aπ

Λ3

,

(9)

where Aµ describes the helicity ±1, π is the longitudinal mode of the graviton in the decoupling limit [10]. Moreover,
Mpl → ∞ and m → 0 in the decoupling limit [20], while Λ3 ≡ Mplm2 is held ﬁxed. This limit represents the
approximation in which the energy scale E is much greater than the graviton mass scale.

III. A SELF-CONSISTENT SPHERICALLY SYMMETRIC ANSATZ

The invariant I ab = gµν∂µφa∂νφb will exhibit a singularity if gµν has any divergence including the coordinate

singularity in the unitary gauge. Therefore, we consider the static spherically symmetric ansatz as follows,

ds2= −b2(r)dt2 + a2(r)dr2 + r2dΩ2,
φ0 = t + h(r),

φi = φ(r)

xi
r

,

(10)

where φi is taken as a ”hedgehog” conﬁguration. The St¨uckelberg ﬁelds reduce to the unitary gauge φa = xµδa
µ only
if h(r) = 0 and φ(r) = r in the ansatz (10). The ansatz (10) contains two additional radial functions, h(r) and φ(r)
as compared with GR. In GR, Birkhoﬀ proved that the vacuum solution of the Einstein ﬁeld equations in the region
exterior to the source is still stationary and is still the Schwarzschild solution [21]. The result is known as Birkhoﬀ’s
theorem. The standard Birkhoﬀ’s theorem is absent, in general, for massive gravity since the T (K)
term has modiﬁed
the Einstein equations. Therefore, the self-consistency of (10) imposes restrictions on h(r) and φ(r), that is, h(r) and
φ(r) should be solutions of the modiﬁed Einstein equations (5).

on the same modality, β is independent of the parameter α4. Furthermore, it is easy to prove that T (K) 0

+ 1). Here, we have abandoned the solution h′ = 0, because there are coordinate singularities in

Finally, the self-consistent ansatz should be written as

ds2= −b2(r)dt2 + a2(r)dr2 + r2dΩ2,
φ0 = t + h(r),
φi = βxi,

(32)

where a(r) = (b(r))−1. Equation (32) makes known that we take the static spherically symmetric metric at the
expense of St¨uckelberg ﬁelds to away from the unitary gauge. On the other hand, the nonunitary gauge provides an
opportunity to avoid the singularity in the invariant I ab from the divergence of gµν in the unitary gauge. Thus, we
achieve two things at one stroke. For example, de Rham and his colleagues [6] have found the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
solution in the 9α2
3 + 3α3 − 12α4 + 1 = 0 case, where the St¨uckelberg ﬁelds stray from the unitary gauge in the static
coordinate system. Meanwhile, the singularities in the invariant I ab are absent. Under the self-consistent ansatz (32),
the invariant I ab is explicitly expressed as

b2 ,

I 00= b2h′2 −
I 0i = I i0 = b2βh′ni,
I ij = β2δij + β2(b2 − 1)ninj,

where (n1, n2, n3) = (sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ). In Appendix A, we explore the invariant I ab in some detail. Obvi-
ously, I 00 is singular if h′ = 0 and b = 0, so that we focus our attention on the case of φ = βr.

IV. EXACT SOLUTIONS

In this section, we present a detailed study of the static spherically symmetric solutions under the ansatz (32) in
the dRGT with two free parameters. The received solutions are free of singularities except from the conventional one
appearing in GR (for instance, r = 0 in the Schwarzschild metric).
The equations of motion in empty space are written as follows:

S, which becomes a candidate for the modiﬁed black hole.
In other words, such black holes can be described by
two physical parameters: the Schwarzschild radius rs and the scalar charge S, so that they are dubbed furry black
holes. If these solutions possess an event horizon, we can show that the singularity of I ab is absent at the horizon (see
Appendix A).

V. CHARGED BLACK HOLE

The Schwarzschild metric and furry metric, derived in Sec. VI, are solutions of the vacuum gravitational ﬁeld
equations (5). In this section, we derive the solution of a spherically symmetric charged body. Such a metric is a
solution of the modiﬁed Einstein equations (5) with a nonvanishing energy-momentum tensor T (m)
µν which arises from
the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

A spherically symmetric electromagnetic potential Aµ will have the following vanishing components: A2 = A3 = 0.
Because Aµ still has the gauge freedom, the only nonvanishing component left of the electromagnetic vector potential
is A0 under a suitable gauge. The nonvanishing components of electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor Fµν are then given by

Equation (55) is nothing but the Reissner-Nordstr¨om solution of GR for the metric; nevertheless, it should be accom-
panied by nontrivial backgrounds for the St¨uckelberg ﬁelds. If rs = Q = 0, (55) goes back to the Minkowski metric
and the St¨uckelberg ﬁelds in the unitary gauge. If and only if r2

The metric (64) is distinguished from the Reissner-Nordstr¨om-de Sitter solution by an additional term ln r

In all three subcases, the singularities of I ab are absent except the physical singularity r = 0. These solutions may
possess event horizon so that they are candidates for the modiﬁed black hole. The event horizon of solution (61) or
(63) depends on three physical parameters: the Schwarzschild radius rs, electric charge Q and scalar charge S, so
that they are charged furry black holes. However, the black hole solution (64) only depends on the electric charge.

VI. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In GR, the spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein equation is a benchmark, and its massive deformation
also plays a crucial role in dRGT. In this work, we have developed a study of the spherically symmetric solutions
in dRGT if the St¨uckelberg ﬁelds are taken as a hedgehog conﬁguration φ0 = t + h(r) and φi = φ(r)xi/r. Under
the hedgehog conﬁguration and the static spherically symmetric metric (10), the self-consistency imposes φ(r) = βr:
β = 1 or β = 2
3α3

+ 1. Note that there is only β = 1 from (30) in the case of α = −3/2 or 0.

On the premise of β = 1, we showed that there is always the Schwarzschild solution and Reissner-Nordstr¨om
solution in dRGT with two free parameters. Furthermore, we can prove that the singularities in the invariant I ab are
absent except the physical singularity r = 0, so that these solutions of massive gravity may be regarded as candidates
for the black hole in dRGT. That is, we are able to reproduce the behavior of GR in the static spherically symmetric
case without constraint for the parameters α3 and α4. It would be interesting to consider the connection between
dRGT and GR based on this result.
In
the Newtonian approximation of GR, the gravitational potential mediated by the point source is Ψ(r) = − rs
r where
rs is the Schwarzschild radius associated with the source. The helicity-0 mode of the graviton also contributes to
the gravitational potential with an additional amount δΨ in dRGT. However, the nontrivial conﬁguration of the
St¨uckelberg ﬁelds also contributes an additional term which is exactly canceled by δΨ. Within such context, the
Newtonian potential is still Ψ(r) in dRGT.

In particular we consider a point source of mass M localized at r = 0.

We also presented ﬁve exact solutions in dRGT for the case of β = 2
3α3

2 and 0 (see Table I).
These solutions have also shown that the singularities in the invariant I ab are absent except the physical singularity
r = 0, so that they may be regarded as candidates of black hole in dRGT. Such black holes [except (64)] contain an
additional physical parameter (scalar charge S); therefore, they are dubbed furry black holes.

+ 1 and α3 6= − 3

In addition, one may be anxious that the scalar perturbations on these backgrounds are inﬁnitely strongly coupled
in light of the results of Ref.[22]. It was found that the de Sitter background has inﬁnitely strongly coupled ﬂuctuations
3 + 3α3 − 12α4 + 1 = 0 [22]. In this work, we have π0 = −h(r)
in the decoupling limit for the parameters chosen as 9α2
and πi = (1 − β)xi. From (9), we obtain the vector mode A0 = − Λ3
m h(r) and Ai = 0 which is diﬀerent from that
studies in [22].

Finally, we can also discuss the cosmic acceleration using our method in this work and will do so in a forthcoming

paper.

Appendix A: NEW BASIC INVARIANT I ab

The existence of St¨uckelberg ﬁelds leads to a basic invariant I ab = gµν∂µφa∂νφb in dRGT. Under ansatz (10), I ab

can be written as

I 00=

h′2
a2 −
I 0i = I i0 =

1
b2 ,
φ′h′
a2 ni,
φ′2
a2 −

I ij =

φ2
r2 δij + (

φ2
r2 )ninj,

(A1)

where (n1, n2, n3) = (sin θ cos ϕ, sin θ sin ϕ, cos θ). In the case of φ = βr, we have the Schwarzschild metric; if it were
the solution of dRGT in the unitary gauge φa = xµδa

µ would be singular at r = rs according to (A1):

1

,

I 00=

r

1 − rs
I 0i = I i0 = 0,
I ij = δij .

For the Schwarzschild metric in the nonunitary gauge (40), we have

I 00= −(1 +

I 0i = I i0 = ±

(A2)

(A3)

so the coordinate singularity at r = rs is absent. Note that there is still the physical singularity r = 0 in the invariant
I ab just as the ones usually encountered in GR (Ricci scalar, Ricci tensor square, Riemann tensor square, etc.).

Generally, we can prove that the singularities in the invariant I ab are absent except the physical singularity r = 0

under the self-consistent ansatz (32). In fact, from the modiﬁed Einstein equations in empty space we have

On the other hand, we have

[pΣ2]2 =

1
1r4 [(b2)′ + (b2 − 1) + λ2r2]2.
λ2

h′2 =

(1 + βb2)2 − b2[√Σ2]2

b4

.

To combine (A1), (A4) and (A5), we obtain I ab as follows

I 00= 2β + β2b2 − [pΣ2]2,
I 0i = I i0 = ±βq(1 + βb2)2 − b2[pΣ2]2ni,
I ij = β2δij + β2(b2 − 1)ninj,

(A4)

(A5)

(A6)

So the singularities are absent except the physical singularity r = 0, since coordinate singularity appears only in the
negative power term of b2.
