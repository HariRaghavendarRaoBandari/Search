Abstract

A recent paper proposed minimal RνMDM models with the type T1-iii and T3 one-
loop topologies. However, the identiﬁed most-minimal model is not viable - the scalar
potential contains a term that explicitly breaks the accidental symmetry, rendering
the dark matter unstable. We present two models that cure this problem. However,
we further show that all of the proposed minimal one-loop RνMDM models suﬀer
from a second problem - namely an additional source of explicit Z2 symmetry breaking
in the Yukawa sector. This problem is inherited by the new models. We perform a
more-general analysis to show that neutrino mass models using either the type T3 or
type T1-iii one-loop topologies do not give viable minimal dark matter candidates.
Consequently, one-loop models of neutrino mass with minimal dark matter do not
appear possible. Thus, presently there remains a single known model giving stable
dark matter without requiring any new symmetries, and another that incorporates
both minimal dark matter candidates, both of which give three-loop neutrino masses.

Introduction

The origin of neutrino mass and the particle physics properties of dark matter (DM) con-
stitute two important unsolved problems in particle physics research. While it is a logical
possibility that these problems possess independent solutions, it is interesting to consider
the alternative - that they admit a common or uniﬁed solution. This was the approach
advocated by Krauss, Nasri and Trodden [1] and also by Ma [2]; both groups presented
models in which neutrino mass appears as a radiative eﬀect due to interactions with a Z2-
odd sector that contains a stable DM candidate. The former (latter) advocated a three-loop
(one-loop) model of neutrino mass. More generally there has been a great deal of research in
this area; for related early works see Ref. [3], while for more recent models see e.g., Ref. [4]
and references therein.

In the Standard Model (SM) proton stability results from an accidental (baryon number)
symmetry. It is natural to ask whether DM stability could similarly result from an accidental
symmetry. This approach, dubbed Minimal DM [5], is well studied in the literature. In the
context of the SM, it is well known that an accidentally-stable DM candidate arises if the SM
is extended to include either a hypercharge-less quintuplet fermion multiplet, F ∼ (1, 5, 0),
or a septuplet scalar multiplet, φ ∼ (1, 7, 0) [5]. Note that the Minimal DM framework does
not hold for a scalar multiplet φ ∼ (1, 5, 0), as the Z2 symmetry is explicitly broken [5].

The notion of Minimal DM was ﬁrst applied to radiative neutrino mass models in Ref. [6],
the goal being to extend the SM with new particles that generate radiative neutrino mass
while also giving an accidental symmetry to achieve a stable DM candidate (the model was
dubbed RνMDM). Unfortunately it was subsequently shown that the model did not work,
due to a symmetry-breaking term in the scalar potential [7]. More recently a three-loop
model of neutrino mass was proposed in which DM stability resulted from an accidental
symmetry (without invoking any beyond-SM symmetries) [8]. This appears to be the ﬁrst
viable model to achieve accidental DM in the context of a radiative neutrino mass model, the
DM being a septuplet fermion, F ∼ (1, 7, 0), in this instance. Similarly, there exists a single
known three-loop model of neutrino mass [9] that employs both minimal DM candidates
identiﬁed in Ref. [5].

Motivated by a recent study of one-loop models for neutrino mass with minimal DM [10],
we perform a general analysis of one-loop models. In particular, we show that neutrino mass
models using either the type T3 or type T1-iii one-loop topologies [11] do not give viable
minimal dark matter candidates. Consequently all of the models identiﬁed in Ref. [10] fail
to give viable DM candidates due to explicit breaking of the requisite accidental symmetry.
Furthermore, our results indicate that it is apparently not possible to obtain minimal DM
by the use of one-loop neutrino mass models.

The layout of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we demonstrate the presence of explicit
Z2 symmetry breaking in the scalar potential of the minimal one-loop model identiﬁed in
Ref. [10], presenting two new models that cure this problem.
In Section 3 we perform a
critical analysis of models with the type T3 one-loop topology. Similarly, we study models
with the type T1-iii topology in detail in Section 4. Conclusions are drawn in Section 5.

2 Symmetry Breaking in the Scalar Potential for Type

T1-iii One-Loop Models

A recent work has reconsidered the RνMDM approach, attempting to ﬁnd one-loop neutrino
mass models with accidentally stable DM candidates [10]. Three models were identiﬁed
as viable; two employing the so-called T1-iii one-loop topology [11], with the beyond-SM
particle content being (see Table 1 in Ref. [10])1

Model A :
Model B :

χ ∼ (1, 7, 0), ψ ∼ (1, 6, 1),
χ ∼ (1, 5, 0), ψ ∼ (1, 4, 1),

¯ψ ∼ (1, 6, −1), φ ∼ (1, 5, 0),
¯ψ ∼ (1, 4, −1), φ ∼ (1, 5, 0),

(1)
(2)

where χ, ψ, and ¯ψ are fermions while φ is a scalar multiplet (the type T1-iii one-loop
diagram for these models is shown in Figure 1). The models are purportedly invariant under
an accidental Z2 symmetry, where χ, ψ, ¯ψ and φ are Z2-odd, while the SM ﬁelds are Z2-
even; it is clear from Figure 1 that this is an accidental symmetry of the loop diagram. One
further model, employing the so-called T3 one-loop topology was also proposed. Ref. [10]
then performed a detailed study of the T1-iii one-loop model with particle content in Eq. (2),
namely Model B.

With regard to Models A and B in Eqs. (1) and (2), we note that the most-general
Lagrangian obtained by adding φ ∼ (1, 5, 0) to the SM contains the term µφ3, which
explicitly breaks any Z2 symmetry under which φ is odd-valued. This point is already
understood by the absence of a scalar quintuplet Minimal DM candidate in Ref. [5]. For
completeness, however, we note that, after writing the scalar quintuplet in symmetric-
tensor notation as φabcd, where the SU(2) indices take values a, b, .. = 1, 2, the cubic term
µ φabcd φef gh ǫcg ǫdh (φ∗)abef appears in the most-general scalar potential (here µ denotes the
coupling). This conclusion holds when additional ﬁelds are added to the model. Thus,
Model B, deﬁned by Eq. (2) and studied in detail in Ref. [10], contains an explicit source of
Z2 symmetry breaking and the DM candidate is unstable.

Here we wish to emphasize that a viable one-loop model for Minimal DM and radiative
neutrino mass via the T1-iii topology is obtained if one modiﬁes Model B by promoting the

ﬁeld content as follows:2

Model C :

χ ∼ (1, 5, 0), ψ ∼ (1, 6, 1),

¯ψ ∼ (1, 6, −1), φ ∼ (1, 7, 0).

(3)

This model appears particularly interesting as it contains two DM candidates, namely the
quintuplet fermion, χ ∼ (1, 5, 0), and the septuplet scalar, φ ∼ (1, 7, 0), both of which were
identiﬁed as Minimal DM candidates in Ref. [5]. Depending on the mass ordering of χ
and φ, it appears that either fermionic or scalar DM is possible (or possibly both in a near
degenerate case). Importantly, the model does not contain the cubic term φ3 in the scalar
potential.

With regards to Model A, we suspect that Table 1 in Ref. [10] (i.e. Eqs. (1) and (2) above)
contains a minor typographical error, in which the scalar φ should instead be a septuplet,
φ ∼ (1, 5, 0) → φ ∼ (1, 7, 0). If this is correct, the scalar potential for Model A preserves
the accidental symmetry of the loop diagram, though, unlike Model B, this model was not
studied in detail. It is important to emphasize, however, that this model contains two DM
candidates, both a fermionic DM candidate, in the form of the septuplet χ ∼ (1, 7, 0) [8] and
a scalar DM candidate, in the form of φ ∼ (1, 7, 0). According to the criterion of minimality
employed in Ref. [10], it appears that Model C in Eq. (3) would be considered more minimal,
due to the smaller SU(2) representations involved.

We also note that a related model is obtained by promoting the fermions ψ in Model A

to octuplets:

Model D :

χ ∼ (1, 7, 0), ψ ∼ (1, 8, 1),

¯ψ ∼ (1, 8, −1), φ ∼ (1, 7, 0).

(4)

This model may also be an interesting variant as it contains two distinct DM candidates,
namely the fermion χ ∼ (1, 7, 0) and the scalar φ ∼ (1, 7, 0), though Model C would be
considered more minimal.

In summary, we ﬁnd the following minimal models of one-loop neutrino mass via the
T1-iii topology in which the accidental symmetry of the one-loop diagram is preserved by
the scalar potential:

Model I :
Model II :
Model III :

χ ∼ (1, 5, 0), ψ ∼ (1, 6, 1),
χ ∼ (1, 7, 0), ψ ∼ (1, 6, 1),
χ ∼ (1, 7, 0), ψ ∼ (1, 8, 1),

¯ψ ∼ (1, 6, −1), φ ∼ (1, 7, 0),
¯ψ ∼ (1, 6, −1), φ ∼ (1, 7, 0).
¯ψ ∼ (1, 8, −1), φ ∼ (1, 7, 0),

(5)

where Model II appears in Ref. [10] (after correcting a typo in Table 1) and Models I and
III are new. The new Model I contains both Minimal DM candidates identiﬁed in Ref. [5],
namely the fermion χ ∼ (1, 5, 0) and the scalar φ ∼ (1, 7, 0), and can give either fermionic
or scalar DM. None of these models possess the cubic term φ3, so the accidental symmetry
of the loop diagram is preserved by the scalar potential. We note that, due to the fact
that the quintuplet and septuplet DM candidates must have O(10) TeV masses [12], and
one of these states must be the lightest exotic in the spectrum, the new multiplets would

be well beyond the reach of the LHC; prospects for testing such models thus appear poor.3
However, searches for galactic gamma-ray signals can provide promising ways to test such
models - in fact, subject to unknown dependencies on the cuspiness of the DM halo, one
can already rule out the quintuplet and septuplet DM candidate in regions of parameter
space [13]. Thus, the models are timely as they predict signals that are directly relevant for
current and next-generation galactic gamma-ray searches.

Given the apparent interest of these models, it is worth investigating further. In the next
sections we perform a general study of one-loop models with type T3 and T1-iii topologies to
determine their viability. It will prove useful to ﬁrst consider models with the T3 topology,
then models with the T1-iii topology. The results of our study have consequences for the
claims of Ref. [10] and Models I, II and III.

3 Models with the Type T3 One-Loop Topology

The general Feynman diagram for the type T3 one-loop topology is shown in Figure 2. This
topology is well-known from the Ma model [2] and related variants [14, 15].
In addition
to the two type T1-iii models, Ref. [10] identiﬁed a model with the type T3 topology that
reportedly gave viable minimal DM. Here we perform a general analysis of models with the
type T3 one-loop topology, showing that they do not preserve the accidental symmetry of
the loop diagram.

As discussed in Ref. [14], the T3 models can be partitioned into two sets, according
to whether lepton number symmetry4 is broken by a Yukawa coupling (corresponding to a
complex intermediate fermion, F = FL + FR), or by the mass insertion (corresponding to
real fermion, FR = F c
L). We ﬁrst discuss the case of a complex intermediate fermion F , such

3This diﬀers from the three-loop model of Ref. [8], which contains an electrically-charged singlet scalar
that is neutral under the accidental symmetry and can thus be lighter than the DM and within reach of the
LHC. Similarly Ref. [9] contains a second Higgs doublet that can remain at the TeV scale.

4We use the convention for lepton number symmetry in which only the fermions have nonzero charge.

Conclusions do not depend on the chosen convention.

where L (H) is the SM lepton (scalar) doublet. Note the the quartic term φ∗
1φ2H 2 auto-
matically appears in the most-general Lagrangian, once the quantum numbers for φ1,2 are
selected to permit the Yukawa terms in Eq. (6), due to the identical quantum numbers of
L and H [16].
It is evident from Figure 2 that the loop diagram possess an accidental
symmetry with action {FL,R, φ1,2} → {−FL,R, −φ1,2}. The key question is whether or not
this accidental symmetry holds in the full Lagrangian, to give a minimal DM candidate. In
what follows we show that the most-general Lagrangian for the type T3 one-loop models
always contains additional terms that explicitly break the accidental symmetry.

The quantum numbers for the beyond SM ﬁelds are denoted as

F ∼ (1, R, Y ), φ1 ∼ (1, (R ± 1), −1 − Y ), φ2 ∼ (1, (R ± 1), 1 − Y ),

(7)

where the choice of plus or minus for the SU(2) quantum numbers of φ1 and φ2 can
be made independently. We seek a model in which F and φ1,2 are charged under an
accidental symmetry. The resulting DM candidate should have vanishing hypercharge, to
evade stringent direct-detection constraints. However, F is complex by construction, giving
Y 6= 0, so one must select the value of Y to ensure that one of the ﬁelds φ1,2 has vanishing
hypercharge. This has two consequences: it restricts us to Y = ±1, and also requires that
R±1 is odd-valued, to ensure a neutral DM candidate, giving even-valued R. To ensure there
is no symmetry breaking cubic term φ3 for the hyperchare-less ﬁeld in the scalar potential,
it must have odd-valued R ± 1 = 4n + 3, for n = 1, 2, ..., so that R ± 1 ≥ 7, with even-valued
R ≥ 6. For these values, the SU(2) group product R⊗R contains the term (R±1) ⊂ (R⊗R).
Thus, the following Yukawa term is consistent with the electroweak symmetry and should
appear in the most-general Lagrangian:

L ⊃ λF φ FR FL φ1/2

for Y = ∓1,

(8)

This term explicitly breaks the accidental symmetry under which F and φ1,2 are charged,
precluding a minimal DM candidate for the T3 one-loop topology with complex intermediate
fermions F .

For the speciﬁc type T3 model proposed in Ref. [10], one has5 FL,R ∼ (1, 6, −1), with
φ1 ∼ (1, 7, 0) and φ2 ∼ (1, 5, 2). Thus, by the above reasoning, the following Yukawa term is
present:

L ⊃ λF φ (FR)abcmn(FL)def mn(φ1)abcd′e′f ′ǫdd′

ǫee′

ǫf f ′

.

(9)

This breaks the accidental symmetry claimed in Ref. [10], making the DM unstable. As a
further blow to this model, the scalar potential also contains a cubic term that explicitly

5We assume a typographical error in Table 2 of Ref. [10], such that φ2 has the correct hypercharge to

achieve the loop diagram.

2φ2. This term generalizes the terms previously

More generally, related cubic terms always appear in the scalar potential for the T3
models with scalar DM; both φ1 and φ2 have odd-valued SU(2) quantum numbers,6 R ± 1,
and, denoting the hypercharge-less ﬁeld as φi, the most-general potential contains the term
φiφ∗
j φj, where i 6= j. Consequently one can also exclude models with type T3 one-loop
topology (with complex intermediate fermions) as minimal DM frameworks due to explicit
symmetry breaking in the scalar potential.

Now let us turn our attention to the type T3 one-loop models with real fermion FR ∼
(1, R, 0), which must have odd-valued R. The Feynman diagram takes the particular form in
Figure 3 where the exotic scalar has the quantum numbers φ ∼ (R ± 1, −1). The Lagrangian
contains the following terms, which are relevant for the mass diagram

RFR + |Dµφ|2 − M 2

φ|φ|2 + λFR Lφ∗ + λφH(φH)2.

(10)

These terms admit the accidental symmetry {FR, φ} → {−FR, −φ}. However, one can
prove that the model always allows the quartic term ∼ Hφ∗φ2, which explicitly breaks
the discrete symmetry. The precise contraction for the SU(2) indices depends on whether
(R ± 1)/2 is odd- or even-valued. For even-valued (R ± 1)/2, one can contract the doublet
H onto the conjugate ﬁeld φ∗, giving Ha(φ∗)a...., while for odd-valued (R ± 1)/2 one may
contract the SM doublet with the non-conjugated ﬁeld φ, giving ǫaa′Haφa′.... In either case,
the accidental Z2 symmetry is explicitly broken.

To give some examples, for R ± 1 = 4, one has even-valued (R ± 1)/2 = 2 and the

contraction of SU(2) indices for the doublet is Ha(φ∗)a...., giving

Ha(φ∗)abc φbmnφcm′n′ ǫmm′

ǫnn′

.

(11)

As shown in Ref. [7], this term breaks the Z2 symmetry advocated in Ref. [6]. Similarly, a
model with R ± 1 = 8, contains the term

Ha(φ∗)abcdef g φbcdmnopφef gm′n′o′p′ ǫmm′

ǫnn′

ǫoo′

ǫpp′

,

(12)

6Recall that the choice of plus or minus is independent for φ1 and φ2, and that we are only considering

models in which R is large enough to ensure the model contains a minimal DM candidate.

6

which extends the results of Ref. [7]. The generalization for larger even-valued (R ± 1)/2
is evident: for (R ± 1)/2 = 2N, with N = 1, 2, ..., one has 2N occurrences of the ǫ-tensor
contracting φ2, avoiding an anti-symmetric contraction of the symmetric factor φ2.

On the other hand, for R ± 1 = 6 one has odd-valued (R ± 1)/2=3, and the contraction

for the doublet is ǫaa′Haφa′..., giving

ǫaa′

Ha(φ∗)bcdef φa′bcmnφdef gm′n′ ǫmm′

ǫnn′

.

(13)

This also generalizes in an obvious way for larger odd-valued (R ± 1)/2: with (R ± 1)/2 =
2N + 1, one has 2N ǫ-tensors contracting φ2. The key point is that for both odd-valued and
even-valued (R ± 1)/2, one has an even number of ǫ-tensors contracting φ2, ensuring the
contraction is symmetric and the term Hφ∗φ2 is consistent with the gauge symmetry. Thus,
in all cases the accidental discrete symmetry of the neutrino mass diagram is broken by the
scalar potential, rendering the DM unstable.

To summarize, we have shown that models in which the SM is extended by a minimal set
of exotic ﬁelds, such that neutrinos acquire mass via the type T3 one-loop diagram, do not
contain viable minimal DM candidates. This is because the accidental symmetry, apparent
in the loop diagram, is explicitly broken by other couplings in the model. For the case of a
complex intermediate fermion, F = FL +FR, the model contains a Yukawa coupling between
F and either φ1 or φ2, as well as a symmetry breaking cubic term in the scalar potential. In
the alternative case with a real fermion FR, the most-general scalar potential always contains
a term Hφ∗φ2. In both cases the oﬀending terms contain three Z2-odd ﬁelds and explicitly
break the discrete symmetry.

4 Models with the Type T1-iii One-Loop Toplogy

Next we undertake a more general study of models with type T1-iii one-loop topology. As
shown in Section 2, among the two type T1-iii models advocated in Ref. [10], Model B, with
the scalar φ ∼ (1, 5, 0), contains a cubic term in the scalar potential that explicitly breaks
the accidental Z2 symmetry of the loop diagram. This problem is cured by modifying the
ﬁeld content of Model B, giving the new Models I and III outlined above. In this section
we determine if the type T1-iii models contain any other terms that break the accidental
symmetry.

For the present discussion, we relabel the ﬁelds in the type T1-iii models as

χ → FL ∼ (1, R, 0),

and

¯ψ → ψR ∼ (1, R ± 1, −1),

(14)

with odd-valued R. Here, we ﬁrst consider the case with a real intermediate fermion. The
scalar then has the quantum numbers

φ ∼ (1, Rφ, 0), with Rφ ∈ {R, R ± 2},

(15)

where the choice for SU(2) quantum numbers for φ and ψR can be made independently. Note
that these three ﬁelds (FL, ψR and φ) comprise a suﬃcient set to allow the one-loop diagram

7

with type T1-iii topology. The resulting loop diagram admits an accidental symmetry with
action {FL, ψR, φ} → {−FL, −ψR, −φ}.

In Section 2 we discussed criterion under which the accidental symmetry of the loop
diagram is shared by the scalar potential, the key point being that the quantum numbers
for φ must preclude a cubic term φ3 in the potential. Here, we turn our attention to the
Yukawa sector. The main concern for these models apparently comes from the term

L ⊃ λF φ F T

L C −1 FLφ,

(16)

which appears to be allowed (here C is the charge-conjugation matrix). Using the explicit
example of Model I, where FL ∼ (1, 5, 0) and φ ∼ (1, 7, 0), the contraction of SU(2) indices
is7

L ⊃ λF φ (F T

L )abcd C −1 (FL)ef gh(φ∗)bcdf gh ǫae.

(17)

However, with regards to Lorentz symmetry, the standard Majorana contraction is symmetric
under interchange of the two ﬁelds. Thus, taking the transpose and interchanging dummy
labels, one can show that this term vanishes identically8 due to the antisymmetric contraction
of the symmetric product of two quintuplet fermions FL. Note, however, that if one instead
used φ ∼ (1, 5, 0), as originally advocated in Ref. [10] for Model B, this term is allowed, with
the contraction given by:

L ⊃ λF φ (F T

L )abcd C −1 (FL)ef gh(φ∗)cdgh ǫaeǫbf .

(18)

Now the symmetric Majorana product of two FL’s is contracted by an even number of ǫ
factors (two in this case), so the term is allowed. Thus, Model B contains an additional
source of accidental symmetry breaking in the Yukawa sector. More generally, one must
check the particular quantum numbers of FL and φ, for a given model, to determine if this
Yukawa term is present.

For Models I, II and III identiﬁed in Eq. (5), the Yukawa term in Eq. (16) vanishes.
Consequently one ﬁnds that the full Yukawa sector of these models (obtained by adding ψR,
FL and φ to the SM), preserves the accidental symmetry of the loop diagram. This result
is appealing and seemingly indicates that Models I, II and III contain good minimal DM
candidates. However, theories comprised of the SM plus FL, ψR and φ, are inconsistent due
to the masslessness of ψR and the presence of quantum anomalies. The solution employed
in Ref. [10] was to add an additional ﬁeld ψL ∼ (1, R ± 1, −1) such that ψL,R form a Dirac
pair. This allows a bare mass for ψ = ψL + ψR and removes the anomaly.

Technically speaking, this approach, which is inherited by Models I and III, employs more
ﬁelds than are required to generate the neutrino loop diagram. None the less, the resulting
spectrum appears to give a minimal construct realizing type T1-iii models. Evidently, the
addition of ψL to the spectrum does not modify the scalar potential of the model, which

7One can write this with φ rather than φ∗, but then more ǫ-tensors appear to clutter the expression.
8With more than one generation of F , one would be able to include this term, provided the couplings are

taken to be anti-symmetric in generation space.

retains the accidental symmetry of the loop diagram. However, one must reconsider the
Yukawa sector in the presence of ψL, to determine if the accidental symmetry remains viable.

By construction, the models now contain the mass term MψψRψL + H.c. However, the
SU(2) product ψR ⊗ ψL contains additional terms and, in particular, contains the term
Rφ ⊂ Rψ ⊗ Rψ, where Rψ = R ± 1. Thus, the type T1-iii models of Ref. [10] contain the
Yukawa term

L ⊃ λψφ ψR ψL φ + H.c.,

(19)

which explicitly breaks the accidental Z2 symmetry. To give an explicit example, for Model
A, with φ ∼ (1, 7, 0) and ψ ∼ (1, 6, −1), the Lagrangian contains the terms

L ⊃ λψφ (ψR)abcde (ψL)abf gh φcdef ′g′h′ǫf f ′

ǫgg′

ǫhh′

+ Mψ(ψR)abcde (ψL)abcde,

(20)

where we include the mass term for completeness. The Yukawa term explicitly breaks the
accidental symmetry of the loop diagram, ultimately rendering the DM unstable, and making
Model A unsuitable as a framework for minimal DM. Model B contains a similar term,
and thus the accidental symmetry of the loop diagram is broken explicitly by both the
Yukawa Lagrangian and the scalar potential in this case. More generally, the Yukawa term
is automatically present and is inherited by all of the Models I, II and III, meaning these,
and related models, fail to admit an accidental symmetry. We conclude that type T1-iii
one-loop models with real fermion FL do not provide minimal DM candidates.

Note that the Yukawa diﬃculties in the T1-iii models stem from the use of the ﬁeld
ψL to give mass to ψR and cure the quantum anomalies. One could ask if the accidental
symmetry could be retained by instead employing a more extended sector to cure these
problems, rather than the minimal choice of ψL. Such a model quickly becomes complicated
- if ψL has diﬀerent quantum numbers to ψR, then even more ﬁelds are needed to remove the
anomaly, along with a new scalar (that contributes to electroweak symmetry breaking) to
give mass to ψR. Such models go against the spirit of the minimal DM framework, requiring
multiple ﬁelds beyond the minimal content required to generate radiative neutrino mass and
give accidental DM. Thus, we do not explore this possibility further.

Next, we turn our attention to type T1-iii models with complex fermion FL,R ∼ (1, R, Y ),
where Y 6= 0. In this case, one has χ → FL and χc → FR, while also allowing ψc → ψ′
L
to have diﬀerent quantum numbers to ψR, as shown in Figure 4.
In such a model, one
must ensure that both ψR and ψ′
L possess non-vanishing hypercharge - if either of these
ﬁelds has Y = 0, the model admits a Majorana mass for that ﬁeld, and combined with
the coupling to φ, the model automatically generates a one-loop diagram with the type T3
topology.9 We have already shown that the particle content of T3 models admits explicit
symmetry breaking terms, so this case should be avoided. Combining this demand with the
fact that complex F has Y 6= 0, by construction, one can show that the scalar φ also has
non-vanishing hypercharge. Thus, the minimal ﬁeld content does not include any multiplets
that contain viable minimal DM candidates, due to the non-vanishing hypercharge of the
exotics. One could consider extending the models to include additional ﬁelds (possibly also

needed to generate mass for the fermions and avoid anomalies), one of which may give a
DM candidate. We do not consider this here, as it is contrary to the minimal DM approach.
Regardless, we can conclude that minimal radiative models of the type T1-iii topology, with
either complex or real fermions F , do not give viable accidental DM candidates.

5 Conclusion

Ref. [10] showed that the irreducible one-loop topologies T1-i and T1-ii do not give viable
minimal DM candidates, while identifying three models of the type T3 and T1-iii topologies
as being viable. Here we showed that Model B, which employs the T1-iii topology, contains
an explicit Z2 symmetry breaking term in the scalar potential as well as a symmetry
breaking Yukawa coupling. We demonstrated that these short-comings could be cured by
modifying the particle content, seemingly realizing two candidate T1-iii models for minimal
DM. However, we further showed that all of the models proposed in Ref. [10] contain an
additional source of explicit Z2 symmetry breaking in the Yukawa Lagrangian, while the
type T3 model also contains symmetry breaking in the scalar potential. Thus, none of the
models proposed in Ref. [10], with either the type T3 or type T1-iii topologies, provide viable
minimal DM candidates, with some of the models containing multiple sources of explicit Z2
symmetry breaking.

Our general study of the type T3 and T1-iii topologies, which included both real and
complex intermediate fermions, showed that neither of these topologies gives viable minimal
DM candidates. Combined with the failure of the T1-i and T1-ii topologies [10], our
results indicate that none of the irreducible one-loop topologies are expected to give viable
minimal/accidental DM candidates. Thus, at present, the only known viable model of
radiative neutrino mass that does not enforce any beyond-SM symmetries, and yet gives
a stable DM candidate due to an accidental symmetry, remains as the three-loop model of
Ref. [8]. Similarly, the only known viable model that employs both of the minimal DM
candidates of Ref. [5] is the three-loop model of Ref. [9]. As a direction for further study,
it would be interesting to determine if two-loop models of radiative neutrino mass can give
viable minimal DM candidates.

Before concluding we note that a general discussion of non-renormalizable operators in
minimal DM models appears in Ref. [17]. The approach of radiative neutrino mass models
with minimal DM is perhaps more agnostic than Ref. [5] regarding the details of the UV
completion and the impact of non-renormalizable operators - the presence of multiple large
multiplets, required to generate neutrino mass, generally causes a Landau pole below the
Planck scale. Thus, one must typically assume that the details of the UV completion preserve
the accidental symmetry of the renormalizable Lagrangian to suﬃcient accuracy, much as
one assumes new TeV-scale physics would preserve the accidental baryon symmetry of the
SM to suﬃcient accuracy to ensure proton longevity.
