Abstract

The paper deals with recursive constructions for simple 3-designs based
on other 3-designs having (1, σ)-resolution. The concept of (1, σ)-resolution
may be viewed as a generalization of the parallelism for designs. We show
the constructions and their applications to produce many previously unknown
inﬁnite families of simple 3-designs. We also include a discussion of (1, σ)-
resolvability of the constructed designs.

Introduction

In our previous papers [16, 17] we have presented several recursive constructions for
simple 3-designs. In [16], among others, generalizations of the well-known doubling
construction of Steiner quadruple systems for 3-designs are introduced. In [17] more
general recursive constructions of simple 3-designs are described, whereby ingredient
designs may have repeated blocks. The methods in these papers are based on the
existence of 3-designs having a parallelism, i.e. the blocks of the design can be parti-
tioned into classes of mutually disjoint blocks such that every point is in exactly one
block of each class. Designs with parallelism have shown to be useful for constructing
designs in the literature [13], [7], [10], [12], [9], [11], [15], [16, 17].

The concept of (1, σ)-resolvability for t − (v, k, λ) designs may be viewed as a
generalization of that of parallelism. For the latter means that the design is (1, 1)-
It should be mentioned that if a t − (v, k, λ) design has a parallelism
resolvable.
we necessarily have k|v; this condition does no longer hold for (1, σ)-resolvability in
general. Thus, the natural question is that whether or not the methods in our previous
papers [16, 17] can be extended to (1, σ)-resolvable 3-designs. We show that this is
in fact the case. Our aim in this paper is to present this generalization. The result

provides a general method for constructing simple 3-designs which largely extends the
use of complete designs as ingredients for the construction. We show the strength of
the method by giving some simple applications to construct a number of families of
simple 3-designs, which, to our knowledge, were not previously known to exist. We
also include a discussion of (1, σ)-resolvability of the constructed designs.

For notation and general deﬁnitions of t-designs we refer to [3, 8].

2 Constructions of 3-Designs using (1, σ)-Resolution

In this section we present recursive constructions of simple 3-designs using (1, σ)-
resolution of their ingredients.

2.1 Preliminaries

We begin with a few deﬁnitions and set up necessary conditions for the ingredients
used in the constructions.

Deﬁnition 2.1 A t − (v, k, λ)-design (X, B) is said to be (s, σ)-resolvable for a given
s ∈ {1, . . . , t}, if its block set B can be partitioned into w classes π1, . . . , πw such that
(X, πi) is a s−(v, k, σ) design for all i = 1, . . . , w. Each πi is called a resolution class.

It is worth noting that the concept of resolvability (i.e. (1, 1)-resolvability) for BIBD
introduced by Bose in 1942 [6] was generalized by Shrikhande and Raghavarao to
σ-resolvability (i.e.
(1, σ)-resolvability) for BIBD in 1964 [14]. A deﬁnition of s-
resolvability (i.e. (s, σ)-resolvability) for t-designs with t ≥ 3 and 1 ≤ s ≤ t may be
found in [1], for example.

Remark 2.1 If (X, B) is the complete t − (v, k,(cid:16)v−t

of (X, B) is a large set of t − (v, k, σ) designs.

k−t(cid:17)) design, then a (t, σ)-resolution

It should be remarked that each t − (v, k, λ) design always has a trivial (s, λs)-
resolution consisting of a single class, i.e. w = 1, for all 1 ≤ s ≤ t. Throughout
the paper when we speak of (s, σ)-resolution we mean that w ≥ 2. Note that w =

λ(cid:16)v
t(cid:17)(cid:16)k

s(cid:17)/σ(cid:16)v

s(cid:17)(cid:16)k
t(cid:17).

Deﬁnition 2.2 Let D be a t − (v, k, λ) design admitting a (s, σ)-resolution with
π1, . . . , πw as resolution classes. Deﬁne a distance between any two classes πi and
πj by d(πi, πj) = min{|i − j|, w − |i − j|}.

For the constructions in this paper we employ designs having a (1, σ)-resolution.

We now describe the detailed assumption and notation used throughout the paper.

Let {k1, . . . , kn, kn+1, . . . , k2n} and k be integers with 2 ≤ k1 < · · · < kn ≤ k/2

such that ki + kn+i = k for i = 1, . . . , n.

2

Assume that there exist 3 − (v, ki, λ(i)) designs Di = (X, Bi) having a (1, σ(i))-
resolution such that wi = wn+i for all i = 1, . . . , n, where wj denotes the number
of classes in a (1, σ(j))-resolution of Dj, i.e. Di and Dn+i have the same number of
resolution classes.

It is also assumed that

1. For each pair (Di, Dn+i), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, either Di or Dn+i has to be simple.

2. If a Dj, j ∈ {i, n + i}, is not simple, then Dj is a union of aj copies of a
simple 3 − (v, kj, α(j)) design Cj, wherein Cj admits a (1, σ(j))-resolution. Thus,
λ(j) = ajα(j).

Note that the trivial 2 − (v, 2, 1) design will be considered as a 3 − (v, 2, λ) design

with λ = 0.

Further we need to specify the way of setting up (1, σ(j))-resolution classes for Dj,

when Dj is the union of aj copies Cj.

1 , . . . , π(j)

Let P (j) = {π(j)

tj } be a (1, σ(j))-resolution of the simple design Cj. The
corresponding (1, σ(j))-resolution of Dj is chosen to be the “concatenation” of aj sets
P (j). This means that the wj = ajtj resolution classes of Dj are arranged in the
following way

π(j)
1 , . . . , π(j)

tj , π(j)

1 , . . . , π(j)

tj , . . . , π(j)

1 , . . . , π(j)
tj .

Finally, we also assume that there exists a 3 − (v, k, Λ) design D = (X, B), when

it is needed in our construction.

min{|i − j|, wℓ − |i − j|}.

• b(j) = σ(j)v/k denotes the number of blocks in each class of a (1, σ(j))-resolution

• uj := σ(j) denotes the number of blocks containing a point in each class of a

(1, σ(j))-resolution of Dj.

• λ(j)

2 = λ(j)(v − 2)/(kj − 2) denotes the number of blocks of Dj containing two

2.2 Construction I

In this section we describe the ﬁrst construction by using the set-up above for the
case kn 6= k/2.

Let ˜Di = ( ˜X, ˜Bi) be a copy of Di deﬁned on the point set ˜X such that X ∩ ˜X = ∅.

Also let ˜D = ( ˜X, ˜B) be a copy of D.

Deﬁne blocks on the point set X ∪ ˜X as follows:

3

I. blocks of D and blocks of ˜D;

II. blocks of the form A∪ ˜B for any A ∈ π(h)

i

and ˜B ∈ ˜π(n+h)

j

with εh ≤ d(h)(π(h)

i

, π(h)

j ) ≤

sh, εh = 0, 1, for h = 1, . . . , n;

III. blocks of the form ˜A∪B for any ˜A ∈ ˜π(h)

i

and B ∈ π(n+h)

j

with εh ≤ d(h)(π(h)

i

, π(h)

j ) ≤

sh, εh = 0, 1, for h = 1, . . . , n.

Here, and in the sequel, the non-negative integers sh, h = 1, . . . , n, denote the
parameters that have to be determined, for which the deﬁned blocks of types I, II
and III form a 3-design. Thus, sh, should not be confused with s in (s, σ)-resolution
as deﬁned above.

Notation: Deﬁne zh = (2sh + 1 − εh) if sh < w
h = 1, . . . , n.

2 , and zh = (2sh − εh) if sh = w

2 , for

Any 3 points a, b, c ∈ X, resp. ˜a, ˜b, ˜c ∈ ˜X are contained in

• Λ blocks of type I,

• zhλ(h)b(n+h) blocks of type II for h = 1, . . . , n,

• zhλ(n+h)b(h) blocks of type III for h = 1, . . . , n.

Thus a, b, c appear together in

blocks. Set

Λ +

∆ =

Xh=1

n

Xh=1

zhλ(h)b(n+h) + zhλ(n+h)b(h)

zhλ(h)b(n+h) + zhλ(n+h)b(h).

Now consider 3 points a, b, ˜c, where a, b ∈ X and ˜c ∈ ˜X. Because of the symmetry
the number of blocks containing 3 points a, b, ˜c, is equal to the number of blocks
containing ˜a, ˜b, c. For each h = 1, . . . , n, any two points a and b are contained in λ(h)
2
blocks of Dh and in λ(n+h)
blocks of Dn+h; further, the point ˜c is in uh (resp. un+h)
blocks of each resolution class of ˜Dh (resp. ˜Dn+h).

2

So a, b, ˜c appear in

• zhλ(h)

2 un+h blocks of type II for h = 1, . . . , n,

• zhλ(n+h)

2

uh blocks of type III for h = 1, . . . , n.

Thus a, b, ˜c are contained together in

Xh=1

2 un+h + zhλ(n+h)

blocks.

Therefore the blocks deﬁned in I, II and III will form a 3-design if

or

Λ + ∆ = Θ,

Λ = Θ − ∆.

Note that Λ = Θ − ∆ ≥ 0. The case Λ = Θ − ∆ = 0 implies that D and ˜D are
not needed in the construction. In both cases either Θ − ∆ > 0 or Θ − ∆ = 0 the
constructed blocks form a simple 3 − (2v, k, Θ) design with

Θ =

uh)}zh,

where 1 ≤ zh ≤ wh if both Dh and Dn+h are simple and 1 ≤ zh ≤ tj if Dj is
non-simple, j ∈ {h, n + h}.

What remains to be veriﬁed is the simplicity of the resulting design when either Dh
or Dn+h is non-simple. Evidently, if both Dh and Dn+h are simple for all 1 ≤ h ≤ n,
then the constructed design is simple.

To start with we observe that two blocks constructed from two pairs (Di, Dn+i)
and (Dj, Dn+j), i 6= j, are always distinct. Further any two blocks of diﬀerent types
are also distinct. Thus, we need to consider two blocks of the same type, in particular,
of type II or type III constructed from a pair (Dj, Dn+j). W.l.o.g. we may assume
that Dj is a union of aj copies of a simple 3 − (v, kj, α(j)) design Cj and Dn+j is
simple.

The following argument is the same for blocks of types II and III. So let E =
A1 ∪ ˜B1 and F = A2 ∪ ˜B2 be two blocks of type II of the resulting design, where
A1 ∈ π(j)
. Suppose E = F . Then ˜B1 = ˜B2,
and hence h1 = h2, since ˜Dn+j is simple. Consequently, A1 = A2, so we have

i2 and ˜B2 ∈ ˜π(n+j)

i1 , ˜B1 ∈ ˜π(n+j)

, A2 ∈ π(j)

h1

h2

1. either i1 = i2,

2. or i1 6= i2.

In the ﬁrst case, E and F are the same block. In the second case, E and F are
repeated blocks; this can happen only if |i2 − i1| is a multiple of tj, i.e. tj| |i2 − i1|,
this is because the resolution classes of Dj are chosen to be the concatenation of aj
copies of a given set P (j) of resolution classes of Cj. Now, as εj ≤ d(j)(π(j)
h1 ) ≤ sj
and εj ≤ d(j)(π(j)
h1 ) ≤ sj, it follows that zj > tj. Therefore, the
second case will not occur if zj ≤ tj.

h2 ) = d(j)(π(j)

i1 , π(j)

i2 , π(j)

i2 , π(j)

Hence, if zj ≤ tj for all non-simple Dj’s, the resulting design remains simple.

With the notation above, we summarize Construction I in the following theorem.

Theorem 2.1 Let {k1, . . . , kn, kn+1, . . . , k2n} and k be integers with 2 ≤ k1 < · · · <
kn < k/2 and ki + kn+i = k for i = 1, . . . , n. Assume that there exist 3 − (v, ki, λ(i))
designs Di = (X, Bi) admitting a (1, σ(i))-resolution such that wi = wn+i, where wj is
the number of resolution classes of Dj. Assume further that at least one design from
each pair (Di, Dn+i), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is simple and if a Dj, j ∈ {i, n + i}, is not simple,
then Dj is a union of aj copies of a simple 3 − (v, kj, α(j)) design Cj admitting a
(1, σ(j))-resolution, i.e. λ(j) = ajα(j). Let tj denote the number of resolution classes
of Cj. Let

(2)

with Λ = Θ − ∆. Then there exists a simple 3 − (2v, k, Θ) design D.

2.3 Construction II

In this section we consider the case kn = k/2.

We observe that the resulting designs in Construction I would have repeated blocks
if kn = k/2 and the block sets of Dn and D2n are not disjoint. To deal with the case
kn = k/2 the blocks constructed from the pair (Dn, D2n) need to be modiﬁed.

Suppose now 2 ≤ k1 < · · · < kn = k/2. Take Dn = D2n and assume that Dn is

simple. Now deﬁne the blocks on the point set X ∪ ˜X as follows:

I. blocks of D and blocks of ˜D;

II. blocks of the form A∪ ˜B for any A ∈ π(h)

and ˜B ∈ ˜π(2n)

Construction II diﬀers from Construction I only in blocks of type IV. Observe that
any three points a, b, c ∈ X (resp. ˜a, ˜b, ˜c ∈ ˜X) are contained in znλ(n)b(n) blocks of
type IV; any three points a, b, ˜c with a, b ∈ X and ˜c ∈ ˜X (resp. ˜a, ˜b, c) are contained
in znλ(n)
2 un blocks of type IV. All other countings as well as the proof of simplicity of
the resulting design remain unchanged as shown in Construction I.

We obtain the following theorem for the case kn = k/2.

Theorem 2.2 Let {k1, . . . , kn, kn+1, . . . , k2n} and k be integers with 2 ≤ k1 < . . . <
kn = k/2 and ki + kn+i = k for i = 1, . . . , n. Assume that there exist 3 − (v, ki, λ(i))
designs Di = (X, Bi) admitting a (1, σ(i))-resolution such that wi = wn+i, where wj is
the number of resolution classes of Dj. Assume further that at least one design from
each pair (Di, Dn+i), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is simple and if a Dj, j ∈ {i, n + i}, is not simple,
then Dj is a union of aj copies of a simple 3 − (v, kj, α(j)) design Cj admitting a
(1, σ(j))-resolution, i.e. λ(j) = ajα(j). Let tj denote the number of resolution classes
of Cj. Let

(ii) Assume that

0 < Θ∗ − ∆∗,

(4)

with 1 ≤ zh ≤ wh if both Dh and Dn+h are simple and 1 ≤ zh ≤ tj if Dj is

with Λ = Θ∗ − ∆∗. Then there exists a simple 3 − (2v, k, Θ∗) design D.

3 Applications

In this section we show applications of Constructions I and II for some small values of
n. It turns out that we can construct many new inﬁnite families of simple 3-designs
by merely using complete designs as ingredients. For these applications we implicitly
use the following result and observation.

7

• Baranyai’s Theorem [2]. The trivial k − (v, k, 1) design is (1,1)-resolvable

(i.e. having a parallelism) if and only if k|v.

• Block orbits. If gcd(v, k) = 1, then the k − (v, k, 1) design is (1, k)-resolvable.
The resolution classes are the block orbits of a ﬁxed point free automorphism
of order v.

3.1 Applications of Construction I

3.1.1 n = 1

We consider the most simple case of Construction I, namely the case with n = 1,
k1 = 2 and k2 = 3.

Let v > 5 be an integer such that v ≡ 0 mod 2 and gcd(v, 3) = 1.

• D1 is the union of a1 = (v − 2)/6 copies of the complete 2 − (v, 2, 1) design C1.
By Baranyai’s Theorem C1 is (1,1)-resolvable, and the number of resolution
(parallel) classes of C1 is t1 = (v − 1). For D1 we have λ(1) = 0, λ(1)
2 = (v − 2)/6,
u1 = 1, b(1) = v/2 and w1 = a1t1.

• D2 is the complete 3 − (v, 3, 1) design. Recall by the observation above that
D2 admits a (1, 3)-resolution, which is derived from the block orbits of a ﬁxed
point-free automorphism of order v on the point set. For D2 we have λ(2) = 1,
λ(2)
2 = v − 2, u2 = 3, b(2) = v and w2 = (v − 1)(v − 2)/6.
• D is the complete 3 − (v, 5, Λ) = 3 − (v, 5,(cid:16)v−3

2 (cid:17)) design.

With the notation of Theorem 2.1 we can check that

if z1 = (v − 4)/2, where

Λ = Θ − ∆

Θ = {λ(1)

2 u2 + λ(2)

2 u1}z1 = 3(v − 2)z1/2,

∆ = {λ(1)b(2) + λ(2)b(1)}z1 = vz1/2,

2 !.
Λ =  v − 3

The constructed design then has parameters 3 − (2v, 5, 3
(v − 2)/6, we have that v ≡ 2 mod 6. Thus we have shown the following.

4(v − 2)(v − 4)). Since a1 =

8

Theorem 3.1 There is a simple

3 − (2v, 5,

3
4

(v − 2)(v − 4))

design for any integer v ≡ 2 mod 6.

We can construct another family of 3-designs with moderate value for Θ. Let

v = 2f + 1 with odd f .

• D1 is the union of a1 = 2f − 1 copies of the complete 2 − (2f + 1, 2, 1) design C1.
2 = a1 = 2f − 1, u1 = 2, b(1) = 2f + 1

So, D1 is (1,2)-resolvable with λ(1) = 0, λ(1)
and w1 = a1t1 with t1 = 2f −1.

• D2 is the complete 3 − (2f + 1, 3, 1) design. Since f is odd, we have 2f + 1 ≡
2 = 2f − 1,

0 mod 3. So, D2 is (1, 1)-resolvable. For D2 we have λ(2) = 1, λ(2)
u2 = 1, b(2) = (2f + 1)/3 and w2 = 2f −1(2f − 1).

• D is a 3−(2f +1, 5, 10(2f −2)) design, which is obtained from the 4−(2f +1, 5, 20)

design [5] with gcd(f, 6) = 1. Thus Λ = 10(2f − 2).

Now

Hence

2 u2 + λ(2)

Θ = {λ(1)
2 u1}z1 = 3(2f − 1)z1,
∆ = {λ(1)b(2) + λ(2)b(1)}z1 = (2f + 1)z1,

Λ = 10(2f − 2).

Λ = Θ − ∆

if z1 = 5. The constructed design has parameters 3 − (2(2f + 1), 5, 15(2f − 1)). We
have the following.

Theorem 3.2 There is a simple 3 −(2(2f + 1), 5, 15(2f −1)) design for gcd(f, 6) = 1.

3.1.2 n = 2

We construct a family of simple 3-designs with k = 7 by using Construction I with
n = 2.

Let v be an integer such that v ≡ 0 mod 4, gcd(v, 3) = 1 and gcd(v, 5) = 1.

• D1 is the union of a1 = (cid:16)v−2
C1. So, D1 is (1,1)-resolvable. Here we have λ(1) = 0, λ(1)
b(1) = v/2 and w1 = a1t1 with t1 = (v − 1).

3 (cid:17)/20 copies of the complete 2 − (v, 2, 1) design

2 = a1, u1 = 1 and

• D3 is the complete 3 − (v, 5,(cid:16)v−3
have λ(3) = (cid:16)v−3

2 = (cid:16)v−2

2 (cid:17), λ(3)

2 (cid:17)) design, which is (1, 5)-resolvable. For D3 we

• D2 is the union of a2 = (v − 3) copies of the complete 3 − (v, 3, 1) design C2.
2 = (v − 2)(v − 3),

So, D2 is (1, 3)-resolvable. For D2 we have λ(2) = v − 3, λ(2)
u2 = 3, b(2) = v and w2 = a2t2 with t2 = (cid:16)v−1
have λ(4) = v − 3, λ(4)

2 = (cid:16)v−2

3 (cid:17).
2 (cid:17), u4 = 1, b(4) = v/4 and w4 = (cid:16)v−1

• D4 is the complete 3 − (v, 4, v − 3) design, which is (1, 1)-resolvable. For D4 we

We have

(v − 3)(v − 4).

It follows that Θ − ∆ = 0 if we have Az1 = Bz2, which reduces to the equation

(v + 10)z1 = 30z2,

where z1 ≤ t1 and z2 ≤ t2, i.e. z1 ≤ v − 1 and z2 ≤ (v − 1)(v − 2)/6. It is clear
that z1 = 30m and z2 = (v + 10)m for integer m ≤ (v − 1)/30 are solutions to the
equation. From z1 = 30m and z2 = (v + 10)m we obtain

Θ =

v(v − 2)(v − 3)m.

Recall that v ≡ 0 mod 4, v ≡ 1, 2 mod 3, and gcd(5, v) = 1. Moreover, since a1 =

(cid:16)v−2
3 (cid:17)/20 must be an integer, we have v ≡ 2, 3, 4 mod 5. Now the congruence system

v ≡ 0 mod 4, v ≡ 1, 2 mod 3, v ≡ 2, 3, 4 mod 5 has v ≡ 4, 8, 28, 32, 44, 52 mod 60 as
solutions. Thus we have proven the following.

Theorem 3.3 There is a simple 3 − (2v, 7, 35
v ≡ 4, 8, 28, 32, 44, 52 mod 60 (with v ≥ 32) and any integer m ≤ (v − 1)/30.

3.2 Applications of Construction II

3.2.1 n = 1

Here is the ﬁrst example.

Let f > 3 be an odd integer such that gcd(f, 3) = 1.

• D1 is the complete 3 − (2f + 1, 3, 1) design. D1 is (1, 1)-resolvable. For D1 we

have λ(1) = 1, λ(1)

2 = 2f − 1, u1 = 1, b(1) = (2f + 1)/3 and w1 = 2f −1(2f − 1).

• D is a 3 − (2f + 1, 6, Λ) design, which is obtained from the 4 − (2f + 1, 6, λ)
design [4] with gcd(f, 6) = 1, where λ ∈ {10, 60, 70, 90, 100, 150, 160}. Thus
Λ = λ(2f − 2)/3.

2

Now from Theorem 2.2 we have Θ∗ = λ(1)

2 u1z1, ∆∗ = λ(1)b(1)z1. So, Θ∗ − ∆∗ =
3(2f − 2)z1. Thus Λ = Θ∗ − ∆∗ if z1 = λ/2. The constructed design has parameters
3 − (2(2f + 1), 6, Θ∗) with Θ∗ = (2f − 1)z1 = (2f − 1)λ/2.

We have the following.

Theorem 3.4 There exists a simple 3 − (2(2f + 1), 6, (2f − 1)m) design for m ∈
{5, 30, 35, 45, 50, 75, 80} and gcd(f, 6) = 1.

We consider another example of general form. Let v, k be integers with v > k ≥ 3

and gcd(v, k) = 1.

• D1 is the complete design 3−(v, k,(cid:16)v−3
b(1) = v, and w1 = (cid:16)v−1

k−1(cid:17)/k.

• D is a 3 − (v, 2k, Λ) design.

k−3(cid:17)). So, λ(1) = (cid:16)v−3

k−3(cid:17), λ(1)

2 = (cid:16)v−2

k−2(cid:17), u1 = k,

We have Θ∗ = λ(1)
design, when it holds

2 u1z1, ∆∗ = λ(1)b(1)z1. Construction II yields a simple 3−(2v, 2k, Θ∗)

Θ∗ − ∆∗ = (λ(1)

2 u1 − λ(1)b(1))z1 = Λ,

or

k − 2!z1 = Λ,
2 v − 3
k−1(cid:17)/k. In this case we have

with z1 ≤ (cid:16)v−1

Θ∗ =

k(v − 2)
2(v − k)

Λ.

We record the result obtained above.

11

Theorem 3.5 Let v > k ≥ 3 be integers with gcd(v, k) = 1. Assume that there exists

a simple 3 − (v, 2k, Λ) design such that m = Λ/2(cid:16)v−3
2(v−k) Λ) design.

Then there exists a simple 3 − (2v, 2k, k(v−2)

k−2(cid:17) is an integer and m ≤ (cid:16)v−1

k−1(cid:17)/k.

We will illustrate some explicit families for 3-designs from Theorem 3.5 by taking

the 3 − (v, 2k, Λ) design D to be the complete 3 − (v, 2k,(cid:16) v−3

2k−3(cid:17)) design.

• k = 3. D is the 3 − (v, 6,(cid:16)v−3
2(v−3)(cid:16)v−3

design with Θ∗ = 3(v−2)
integer. This condition is equivalent to v ≡ 1, 2 mod 3 and v ≡ 0, 1 mod 4.
Hence v ≡ 1, 4, 5, 8 mod 12.

3 (cid:17)) design. There exists a simple 3 − (2v, 6, Θ∗)
k−2(cid:17) = (v − 4)(v − 5)/12 is an

• k = 4. D is the 3 − (v, 8,(cid:16)v−3

design with Θ∗ = 4(v−2)
is an integer. This condition is equivalent to v ≡ 1, 3 mod 4 and v ≡ 0, 1, 2 mod
5. Hence v ≡ 1, 5, 7, 11, 15, 17 mod 20.

5 (cid:17)) design. There exists a simple 3 − (2v, 8, Θ∗)
2 (cid:17) = (v−5)(v−6)(v−7)/2.3.4.5

5 (cid:17), if m = (cid:16)v−3

• k = 5. D is the 3−(v, 10,(cid:16)v−3

with Θ∗ = 5(v−2)
is an integer. This condition is equivalent to gcd(v, 5) = 1, v ≡ 0, 1, 6, 7 mod 8
and v ≡ 0, 1, 2, 6 mod 7.

7 (cid:17)) design. There is a simple 3−(2v, 10, Θ∗) design
2 (cid:17) = (v−6)(v−7)(v−8)(v−9)/16.3.5.7

7 (cid:17), if m = (cid:16)v−3

7 (cid:17)/2(cid:16)v−3

2(v−4)(cid:16)v−3

In summary, we have the following corollary of Theorem 3.5.

Corollary 3.6 The following hold.

2(v−3)(cid:16)v−3

Let v, k be integers such that v > 2k, k ≥ 3, gcd(v, 2k) = 1 and gcd(v, k + 1) = 1.

• D1 is a union of a1 =

C1. Since gcd(v, 2) = 1, C1 is (1, 2)-resolvable and has t1 = (v − 1)/2 resolution

We then obtain a simple 3−(2v, 2(k +1), Θ∗) design, if there exist positive integers

z1 and z2 with z1 ≤ t1 and z2 ≤ w2 for which Θ∗ − ∆∗ = 0.

Then we have

Hence, if Θ∗ − ∆∗ = 0, we have Az1 = Bz2. In particular, if A/B is an integer,
then for any integer 1 ≤ z1 ≤ t1 such that z2 = z1A/B ≤ w2, we obtain a simple
3 − (2k, 2(k + 1), Θ∗) design.
Here we record this result.

gcd(v, k + 1) = 1. Deﬁne A = (cid:16) v−3

Theorem 3.7 Let v, k be integers such that v > 2k, k ≥ 3, gcd(v, 2k) = 1 and

an integer, then for any integer 1 ≤ z1 ≤ (v − 1)/2 such that z2 = z1A/B ≤ 1

We illustrate two special cases with k = 3 and k = 4 of Theorem 3.7.

• k = 3.

We then have A/B = (v−5)(v−3)
. The conditions that gcd(v, 6) = gcd(v, 4) = 1
and A/B is an integer are equivalent to v ≡ 2 mod 3, v ≡ 1, 3 mod 4 and
v ≡ 0, 2 mod 5. Thus we have v ≡ 5, 17, 35, 47 mod 60. Note that z2 = z1A/B.
In this case we have a 3 − (2v, 8, Θ∗) with

where 1 ≤ z1 ≤ (v − 1)/2.

• k = 4.

We obtain A/B = (v − 6)(v − 7)(13v + 16)/8.3.5.7 . The requirement that
gcd(v, 2k) = gcd(v, 8) = 1, gcd(v, k + 1) = gcd(v, 5) = 1 and A/B is an
integer, reduces to v ≡ 7 mod 8, v ≡ 1, 2, 3 mod 5 and v ≡ 0, 2, 6 mod 7. Hence
v ≡ 7, 23, 63, 111, 167, 191, 223, 231, 247 mod 280. And we have a simple 3 −

integers v ≡ 5, 17, 35, 47 mod 60 and m ≤ (v − 1)/2.

3.3

(1, σ)-resolvability of the constructed designs

In this section, we discuss the question of (1, σ)-resolvability of the designs obtained
by Constructions I and II. In particular, we will consider the cases Θ − ∆ = 0 and
Θ∗−∆∗ = 0, i.e. the cases where a 3−(v, k, Λ) design D is not used in the construction.

We make use of the following observation.

14

• Let (Dh, Dn+h) be a pair of designs in Constructions I or II such that kh 6= kn+h.

For given (i, j) the blocks constructed from the resolution classes (π(h)
and (˜π(h)

) will be denoted by B(i,j)

j

i

, π(n+h)

j

i

h,n+h. Thus

B(i,j)
h,n+h = {A ∪ ˜B, ˜A ∪ B /A ∈ π(h)

i

, ˜A ∈ ˜π(h)

i

, B ∈ π(n+h)

j

, ˜B ∈ ˜π(n+h)

j

}.

Recall that εh ≤ d(h)(π(h)
appears in

i

, π(h)

j ) ≤ sh. It follows that each point x ∈ X or ˜x ∈ ˜X

σ(i) := uhb(n+h) + un+hb(h)

blocks of B(i,j)

h,n+h. Note that |B(i,j)

h,n+h| = 2b(h)b(n+h).

• For the blocks of type IV in Construction II we have Dn = D2n i.e. kn = k2n.
n,n denote the set of blocks constructed from resolution classes of Dn and

Let B(i,j)
˜Dn corresponding to the pair (i, j). Then we have

n,n = {A ∪ ˜B /A ∈ π(n)
B(i,j)

i

, ˜B ∈ ˜π(n)

j }.

We have |B(i,j)

n,n | = b(n)b(n) and each point x ∈ X or ˜x ∈ ˜X appears in

σ(n) := unb(n)

blocks of B(i,j)
n,n .

Let m1, . . . , mn be positive integers such that

m1σ(1) = · · · = mnσ(n) := σ.

Observe that the blocks constructed by each pair (Dh, Dn+h) is a union of zhwh
subsets B(i,j)
h,n+h of equal size. Now assume that mh|zhwh for all h = 1, . . . , n. This is
equivalent to say that the blocks constructed by the pair (Dh, Dn+h) can be parti-
tioned into zhwh/mh disjoint 1 − (2v, kh + kn+h, σ) = 1 − (2v, k, σ) designs. It is then
clear that the constructed design is (1, σ)-resolvable.

In summary, by using the notation above we have the following result.

Proposition 3.9 Let D be a 3 − (2v, k, Θ) (resp. 3 − (2v, k, Θ)∗) design obtained by
Construction I (resp. Construction II) for which Θ − ∆ = 0 (resp. Θ∗ − ∆∗ = 0).
Assume that there exist positive integers m1, . . . , mn with mh|zhwh, for h = 1, . . . , n,
such that m1σ(1) = · · · = mnσ(n)
:= σ. Then the constructed design D is (1, σ)-
resolvable.

In the rest of this section we consider the (1, σ)-resolvability of some families of

3-designs constructed above.

15

• We begin with the simple 3−(2v, 7, 35

4 v(v−2)(v−3)m) design D in Theorem 3.3,
where v ≡ 4, 8, 28, 32, 44, 52 mod 60 (with v ≥ 32) and integer m ≤ (v − 1)/30.
The design D is obtained by Construction I with n = 2 and Θ − ∆ = 0. From
the parameters of the ingredients (see the proof of Theorem 3.3) we have
σ(1) = u1b(3) + u3b(1) = v + 5v/2 = 7v/2,
σ(2) = u2b(4) + u4b(2) = 3v/4 + v = 7v/4.
Choose m1 = 1 and m2 = 2. Then we have σ = σ(1) = 2σ(2). Now the condition
of Proposition 3.9 reduces to m2|z2w2, i.e. 2|(v + 10)mw2, which is always
satisﬁed since v is even. Hence D is (1, 7v/2)-resolvable.

• Consider the designs in Corollary 3.8 obtained by Construction II with n = 2

and Θ∗ − ∆∗ = 0.

(i) Let D be a simple 3−(2v, 8, 7

30 v(v−2)(v−3)(v−5)m) design from Corollary

3.8, where v ≡ 5, 17, 35, 47 mod 60 and m ≤ (v − 1)/2. Here we have
σ(1) = u1b(3) + u3b(1) = 2v + 6v = 8v,
σ(2) = u2b(2) = 4v.
Take m1 = 1 and m2 = 2, then σ = σ(1) = 2σ(2) = 8v. The condition is
m2|z2w2, i.e. 2|z2w2, where z2 = z1A/B with A/B = (v−5)(v−3)
. Since v is
odd, so A/B is even. Thus 2|z2w2. Hence D is (1, 8v)-resolvable.

3.5

(ii) Similarly, let D be a simple 3 − (2v, 10, 81v(cid:16)v−2

6 (cid:17)m/7(v − 5)) design from

Corollary 3.8, with v ≡ 7 mod 8, v ≡ 1, 2, 3 mod 5, v ≡ 0, 2, 6 mod 7 and
m ≤ (v − 1)/2. We have
σ(1) = u1b(3) + u3b(1) = 2v + 2kv = 10v,
σ(2) = u2b(2) = (k + 1)v = 5v.
Take m1 = 1 and m2 = 2, then σ = σ(1) = 2σ(2) = 10v. The condition
is m2|z2w2, i.e. 2|z2w2, where z2 = z1A/B with A/B = (v−6)(v−7)(13v+16)
.
Thus, if either z1(= m) is even or A/B is even, then the condition 2|z2w2 is
satisﬁed. Hence the design D is (1, 10v)-resolvable. Note that A/B being
an even integer is equivalent to 16|(v−7) or v ≡ 7 mod 16, v ≡ 1, 2, 3 mod 5
and v ≡ 0, 2, 6 mod 7.

8.3.5.7

We have proven the following.

Proposition 3.10 The following hold.

(i) The 3−(2v, 7, 35

4 v(v−2)(v−3)m) design D in Theorem 3.3 is (1, 7v/2)-resolvable

for v ≡ 4, 8, 28, 32, 44, 52 mod 60 (with v ≥ 32) and integer m ≤ (v − 1)/30.

(ii) The 3 − (2v, 8, 7

30 v(v − 2)(v − 3)(v − 5)m) design D from Corollary 3.8 is (1, 8v)-

resolvable for v ≡ 5, 17, 35, 47 mod 60 and m ≤ (v − 1)/2.

16

(iii) The 3 − (2v, 10, 81v(cid:16)v−2

7, 23, 63, 111, 167, 191, 223, 231, 247 mod 280 and m ≤ (v − 1)/2 is (1, 10v)-
resolvable, if either m even or 16|(v − 7).

6 (cid:17)m/7(v − 5)) design D from Corollary 3.8 for v ≡

It is an open question whether Constructions I and II provide a (2, σ)-resolvable
