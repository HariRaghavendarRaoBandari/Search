Abstract. We present the results of a coupled-channel model for ¯KN scattering in the
resonance region. The model fulﬁlls unitarity, has the correct analytical properties for the
amplitudes and the partial waves have the right threshold behavior. The parameters of the
model have been established by ﬁtting single-energy partial waves up to J = 7/2 and up to
2.15 GeV of center-of-mass energy. The Λ∗ and Σ∗ spectra has been obtained, providing a
comprehensive picture of the S = −1 hyperon spectrum. We use the structure of the hyperon
spectrum and Regge phenomenology to gain insight on the nature of the Λ(1405) resonances.

1. Introduction
The comprehensive understanding of the strong interaction in the hadronic energy range is one
of the open problems in particle and nuclear physics. Problems such as non-perturbative aspects
of Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD), how quarks and gluons aggregate to constitute hadrons,
conﬁnement and chiral symmetry breaking have spectroscopy of excited baryons constituted by
light valence quarks (u, d, and s) as one of their primary tools for research. For these reasons,
many experiments have measured πN and ¯KN scattering as well as photoproduction oﬀ the
proton in order to garner information on the spectrum. However, the amount of experimental
information to pin down hyperon resonances with S = −1 (Y ∗ = Λ∗, Σ∗) is not as wealthy
as for the case of nucleon excitations (S = 0) and, as a consequence, its spectrum is less
understood. Only in recent years we are starting to have a good grasp of the Y ∗ spectrum and
pole positions have started to be reported by the Review of Particle Physics (RPP) [1] thanks
to the development of models for kaon electroproduction [2] and ¯KN scattering [3, 4]. Once a
baryon resonance and its location in the complex plane have been well-established, it is time to
understand if the nature of that state is (mostly) that of a three quark system, a molecule or a
pentaquark, and to ﬁnd out what is the role of gluonic excitations for that particular state. In
section 2 we provide a brief description of the amplitude analysis of ¯KN scattering performed in
[3] that allowed to provide the most comprehensive picture of the S = −1 hyperon spectrum to
the date. In section 3 we use the structure of the hyperon spectrum and Regge phenomenology
to gain insight on the nature of the Λ(1405) resonance, the ﬁrst excitation of the isospin-0 uds
system and a long-standing problem in hadron spectroscopy.

2. ¯KN scattering in the resonance region
The ¯KN → ¯KN reaction, besides its importance for studies of the Y ∗ spectrum, plays a role in
amplitude analysis of more complicated reactions, which include decays (pentaquark searches)
[5, 6] and K ¯K pair photoproduction [7, 8]. For example, the recent observation of two pentaquark

b → J/ψ K−p decay [5] uses a speciﬁc model to incorporate Y ∗ resonances in the
states in Λ0
K−p channel. Studies of systematic uncertainties should involve the comparison with other
models of ¯KN interactions and should incorporate background eﬀects, not just Y ∗ excitations
[6]. Real and quasi-real diﬀractive photoproduction of K ¯K pairs can produce the poorly known
[7], i.e., mesons containing s¯s pairs that also include exotic mesons with hidden strangeness. The
factorization of the K ¯K photoproduction vertex requires separation of target fragmentation at
the amplitude level. Hence, the provision of amplitudes describing the ¯KN interactions in target
fragmentation is relevant to future partial-wave analyses of the γp → K ¯Kp process. At Jeﬀerson
Lab [8], both CLAS12 (Hall B) and GluEx (Hall D) experiments will devote part of their eﬀort
to study this reaction. Hence, it is timely to develop a model for ¯KN → ¯KN scattering that
can be incorporated in the analysis of both three-body decay and two kaon photoproduction
experiments.
In [3] we presented a coupled-channel model for ¯KN → ¯KN scattering in the resonance
region that incorporates up to 13 channels per partial wave, analyticity, unitarity, and the right
angular momentum barrier for the partial waves. All the details can be found in [3] and here
we sketch the building blocks of the model.

The partial-wave expanded S(cid:96) matrix is related to the amplitude T(cid:96) through

S(cid:96) = I + 2iR(cid:96)(s) = I + 2i [C(cid:96)(s)]1/2 T(cid:96)(s) [C(cid:96)(s)]1/2 ,

where I is the identity matrix and the diagonal matrix

accounts for the phase space, where qk(s) =(cid:112)(m1m2)(s − sk)/(m1 + m2), sk is the threshold

,

center-of-mass energy squared of the corresponding channel k, m1 and m2 are the masses of the
ﬁnal states, q0 = 2 GeV is a normalization factor for the momentum in the resonance region,
r = 1 fm is an eﬀective interaction range parameter and T(cid:96)(s) is the analytical partial-wave
amplitude matrix. We write T(cid:96)(s) in terms of a K matrix [9] to ensure unitarity

T(cid:96)(s) =(cid:2)K(s)−1 − iρ(s, (cid:96))(cid:3)−1

,

where ρ(s, (cid:96)) is the dispersive integral over the phase space matrix C(cid:96)(s),

In [10] the experimental database in the resonance region with 2.19 < s < 4.70 GeV2
(approximately 17500 data points for the K−p → K−p, K−p → ¯K0n, K−p → π0Λ,
K−p → π0Σ0, K−p → π−Σ+, and K−p → π+Σ− channels) was analyzed and the single-energy
partial waves were obtained for ((cid:96)I 2J ) up to J = 7/2, i.e. S01, P01, P03, D03, D05, F05, F07, G07,
S11, P11, P13, D13, D15, F15, F17, and G17. We ﬁtted our model to these single-energy partial
waves employing MINUIT [11] and a genetic algorithm [12]. The uncertainties were computed
using the bootstrap technique [13]. The value of all parameters and the codes to compute the
partial waves and the observables are available from the Joint Physics Analysis Center webpage
[14, 15]. Once the parameters of the model have been established we can analytically continue
the partial waves to the unphysical Riemann sheets and search for poles that correspond to
the hyperon resonances. Figures 1 and 2 show the Λ∗ and Σ∗ resonances found in the diﬀerent
partial waves.

3. The nature of the Λ(1405) resonance(s)
Since its discovery in the early 60’s [16], the nature of the Λ(1405), the ﬁrst excitation of the
isospin-0 uds system, is a long-standing problem in hadron spectroscopy. It has regained interest
−
due to the recent experimental conﬁrmation of its, for decades assumed, spin and parity J P = 1
2
[17] and the latest developments in amplitude analysis [18, 19], lattice QCD [20, 21, 22], and
quark-diquark models [23, 24].

3.1. Status of amplitude analysis in the Λ(1405) region
A recent combined amplitude analysis on ¯KN scattering and πΣK+ photoproduction oﬀ the
proton data based on the unitarization of the chiral potential via a coupled channel Bethe–
Salpeter equation [18] has conﬁrmed previous works [19, 25] that stated that the Λ(1405)
compiled in the RPP [1] is not a single state but two diﬀerent resonances (poles) located at
1429+8−7 − i 12+2−3 MeV and at 1325+15−15 − i 90+12−18 MeV [18]. In [18] and previous analyses [25],
the resonances are dynamically generated and their authors interpreted both poles as molecular
states whose origin is entirely due to the ¯KN and πΣ interactions. However, an interpretation
of this kind has to be taken with care because, besides model-dependency, the employed

parameters with the only requirement of being of natural size. These constants encapsulate the
information on unresolved degrees of freedom and can hide resonant states whose origin is not
dynamical.

3.2. Status of Λ(1405) in quark models
The Λ(1405) quantum numbers are those of a uds state but, in the past, constituent quark
models have failed to match the experimental mass [26]. This situation has improved during
2015 with two calculations based on the relativistic interacting quark-diquark model that obtain
values closer to the amplitude extractions: 1431 MeV in [23] and 1406 MeV in [24].

3.3. Status of Λ(1405) in lattice QCD
Although it would be desirable to understand the nature of the Λ(1405) directly from QCD via
lattice QCD, the resonant nature of this state makes its numerical investigation taxing. There
have been recent exploratory studies of this state from lattice QCD identifying the Λ(1405) as
a ¯KN molecule in [21] and as an ordinary three-quark state in [22]. Unfortunately, in accessing
the spectrum and the subsequent analysis of the spectrum the strong decay to the πΣ, ¯KN
scattering states is neglected. This approximation has been formally [27] and numerically
[28, 29] demonstrated to only be justiﬁable in the narrow-width limit.
In fact, it has been
recently demonstrated that ﬁnite volume matrix elements of electromagnetic current obtained
via lattice QCD, cannot be directly interpreted as inﬁnite-volume form factors of resonances [30]
Hence, it is hard to asses the size of the systematic errors of the exploratory investigations listed
above. In order to make a deﬁnitive statement of the implications of lattice QCD regarding the
true nature of the Λ(1405), a thorough analysis of the coupled πΣ, ¯KN scattering amplitude
will be needed, as has been done in [29] for the mesonic sector.

3.4. Regge analysis of the Λ∗ spectrum
It is clear that a big progress has been made in the last years, but the ﬁnal answer on the
nature of the Λ(1405) state(s) remains elusive. In [31] we used Regge phenomenology and our
knowledge on the hyperon spectrum to assess the nature of the two Λ(1405) poles. From complex
angular momentum theory we know that resonances follow Regge trajectories that connect poles
at diﬀerent partial waves [32]. Hence, we can use Regge trajectories to connect the ground states
to their excitations and derive conclusions based on the shape of the trajectories, as their (non-
)linearity depend on the quark-gluon dynamics [33]. If we use the current knowledge on the
Λ∗ spectra we can compute the parent Regge trajectories and shed light on the nature of the
In ﬁgure 3

we show the Chew–Frautschi plot [34], i.e. (cid:60)(sp) vs. J, where sp is the pole position and
J stands for the total angular momentum of the resonance. The Λ(1116) is taken from the
RPP [1], Λ(1405)a (1429+8−7 − i 12+2−3 MeV) and Λ(1405)b (1325+15−15 − i 90+12−18 MeV) from [18],
and the rest of the Λ∗ poles from the ¯KN amplitude analysis presented in section 2.
It is
apparent how the projection of the Regge trajectories onto the ((cid:60)(sp),J) plane in ﬁgure 3 follow
linear trajectories as expected from three-quark states [33]. However, both Λ(1405) resonances
lay on top of the parent Regge trajectory. The situation clariﬁes if we realize that the poles
are complex quantities and it is also possible to plot −(cid:61)(sp) vs. J, which corresponds to the
projection of the Regge trajectory onto the (−(cid:61)(sp),J) plane. We provide such plot in ﬁgure 4.
It is apparent how the poles follow a square-root behavior and that the Λ(1405)a state ﬁts in the
unnatural parity parent Regge trajectory while the Λ(1405)b state does not. Hence, Λ(1405)a
shares the same nature of the other states of the unnatural parity parent Regge trajectory, i.e.
it is mostly a three-quark state, while Λ(1405)b does not belong to any linear Regge trajectory
and, hence, cannot be a three-quark state, i.e.
it is either a molecule or a pentaquark. We

refer the reader to [31] for a quantitative analysis and details on the arguments. This result
is consistent with quark-diquark models ﬁnding only one Λ(1405) state [23, 24] and diﬀerent
results in the exploratory lattice QCD calculations [21, 22]. Further studies should assess if the
nature of Λ(1405)b is that of a pentaquark or a molecular state.

4. Conclusions
(i) We have developed a ¯KN amplitude in the resonance region that incorporates up to
13 channels per partial wave, has the right angular momentum barrier, analyticity and
unitarity, obtaining the most comprehensive picture of the S = −1 hyperon spectrum to
the date;

(ii) The model can be incorporated in the analysis of three-body decay experiments for
pentaquark searches and two kaon photoproduction experiments for strangeonia and exotics
with hidden strangeness search;

(iii) The codes to compute the partial waves and the observables (cross sections and

asymmetries) can be run online and downloaded from [15];

(iv) Using Regge phenomenology and our knowledge of the Λ∗ spectrum we are able to establish
that the higher-mass Λ(1405) resonance is mostly a three-quark state while the lower-mass
Λ(1405) resonance is either a molecule or a pentaquark.
