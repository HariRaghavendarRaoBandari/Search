Abstract

Nutation is an oscillatory movement that plants display during their development. Despite its ubiquity
among plants movements, the relation between the observed movement and the underlying biological
mechanisms remains unclear. Here we show that the kinematics of the full organ in 3D gives a simple
picture of plants nutation. The orientation of the curvature is modiﬁed to align with the direction in which
the growth diﬀerential is maximal. This allows to criticize established measurement where the movement
of the apical tip is taken as a marker of the growth dynamics. Despite its validity under certain set
of hypotheses, this measurement is not suﬃcient to decipher the speciﬁc role of each mechanism. As
an example we re-interpret previously measured experimental observations using our model. This novel
analysis sheds light on previous studies on nutation and presents measurable parameters that can be used
to unravel the underlying mechanism.

Introduction

During their development, plant organs display a large range of movements powered by growth. These
movements may be broadly divided into two classes; tropisms and nastic movements. Tropisms are
oriented towards an external stimulus, e.g. light or gravity [1, 2]. Nastic movements account for endoge-
nous, autonomous movements and are not directed towards an external stimulus. Nutation, often called
circumnutation, is a particular class of nastic movements, in which the plant organ successively bends
in diﬀerent directions, resulting in an apparent oscillatory swinging of the organ. Despite its ubiquity
among plant movements, nutation has not been studied as extensively as tropisms, and the mechanism
responsible for this movement as well as its regulation remain unclear (see [3] for a review). Two main
competitive models are currently used to explain the mechanism underlying nutation [4]. The ﬁrst, sug-
gested by Darwin [5], assumes the existence of an endogenous oscillator that is solely responsible for
the observed movement. The second suggests that the movement stems from an overshoot during the
straightening of the plant in response to the direction of gravity.

To measure nutation, it is common to track the projection of the apical part of the organ in the plane
orthogonal to the gravitational ﬁeld (which we deﬁne here as the apical plane Pa) [6, 7]. Measurements
carried out on diﬀerent species and organs [5, 7] exhibit disorganized patterns (zig-zag shaped), and
organized patterns (for instance, elliptical patterns, and the limits of these patterns, e.g. a circle or
line) [6, 8–11]. This measurement is only partial, as the full shape in 3D and the dynamics of the plants
in space and in time are rarely taken into account. The interpretation of these results remains unclear as
the relation between the activity of the organ (e.g. the diﬀerential growth) and the kinematics in space
and time have not been clearly deﬁned.

Attempts have been made to develop a mathematical model of nutation, but the geometry of the
organ has been neglected resulting in an incomplete kinematic description [12]. The existing models
account only for the dynamics of the apical tip and it has been shown to be insuﬃcient to understand
the underlying mechanisms, since geometrical and local eﬀects are neglected [1, 13]. We have recently
proposed a framework for the study of tropic movement that reveals a geometrical constraint on the

2

movement [14–16]. This model has proven powerful in understanding the relation between diﬀerential
growth rate and curvature variation.

Here we will state the relevant geometrical framework for the study of nutation dynamics, and present
a minimal model accounting for observed classes of movement patterns. The analysis is done both
analytically and through numerical simulations. The model’s limitations are also discussed. Lastly, the
model is applied to existing experimental observations, and the relevance of the apical measurements is
discussed. The details of all calculations are given in the appendix.

Models and Methods

Hypotheses

As mentioned earlier, it is common to measure nutation by tracking the projection of the apical part of
the organ in the apical plane [6, 7]. In this work we aim to present a minimal dynamical model of the
whole organ that will capture diﬀerent classes of such observed apical measurements. In order to do so
we have to ﬁrst clearly state a suﬃcient and minimal set of hypotheses relating whole organ dynamics
and apical movement (which are otherwise generally implicitely assumed). We propose the following:

H1 - There is no local eﬀect: the dynamics do not depend on the local position along the organ and

are considered to be the same over the whole organ.

H2 - There is a unique relation between the shape of the organ and the position of the apical tip. As
many 3D shapes can result in the same apical measurement, constraints on the shape need to be stated
explicitly.

H3 - If the projection is only measured on a single plane, the eﬀects due to the elongation of the organ

may be disregarded.

Geometrical Description

During nutation, the organ is curved along diﬀerent planes in 3D space, unlike the movements observed
for example in gravitropism where the curve is constrained to a unique plane. The kinematics given
in [14–16] are only suﬃcient to describe growing elongated organs in a single plane and are therefore
inadequate here.

The organ is assumed to be cylindrical with a constant radius R along the organ. It is assumed that
no shear growth is observed in plants, so the cross section remains in plane. The organ is described by
the curvilinear abscissa s along the median line. Each point at the surface of the organ is then deﬁned
via cylindrical coordinates (s, φ) where s is its position along the abscissa, and φ is the angle of the point
on the cross section, relative to an arbitrarily chosen direction. This description is depicted in Figure 1.A
and in movie S1. In order to fully describe the curvature of an organ curved in some direction in space,
it is ﬁrst necessary to deﬁne two vectors: t, the tangent to the curve, and c, the normal (perpendicular)
to the median line whose orientation in the cross section, ψc(t), is in the same plane as the principal
direction of curvature (see Figure 1.B and Figure 2).

This means that for each element of the curve, the curvature is maximal in the plane deﬁned by the
vectors t and c (see Figure 1.B). Figure 1.C shows a cross section of the shoot, in the plane orthogonal
to t, deﬁning the orientation ψc of the principal direction of curvature c.

Model

Slaving of the direction of maximal curvature to diﬀerential growth in the orthogonal plane

Given the geometrical framework presented here, we now bring a minimal model describing nutation
kinematics based on basic mechanic and geometric arguments. We recall that for simplicity we assume

direction of the growth diﬀerential, deﬁned by the vector g in blue, is deﬁned by the angle φ = ψg. Due
to the cylindrical symmetry considered for the organ, the direction given by φ = 0 is deﬁned arbitrarily.

an organ with constant radius R. In order to describe the compatible elongation strain rate along the
periphery of the organ, ˙ǫ(φ, s, t), resulting from the variation of curvature and the variation of the principal
direction of curvature, an equation of motion should be deﬁned at time t and point s along the organ, at
angle φ along the periphery (details of the calculation can be found in Section A 1 in the Appendix):

˙ǫ(φ, s, t) =

R sin (φ − ψc(s, t)) Dtψc(s, t)C(s, t) + R cos (φ − ψc(s, t)) DtC(s, t)

with the material derivative Dt which co-moves with each element as the organ elongates [1, 13, 15]:

˙E(s, t).

Let us note that Equation 1 has two main components: the ﬁrst, DtCR cos (φ − ψc), is given by the
diﬀerential growth in the principal direction of curvature and is related to the variation of curvature. The
second, Dtψc sin (φ − ψc), and is related to the variation of the orientation of the plane of curvature. It
is therefore instructive to deﬁne the diﬀerential, or diﬀerence, of deformation in the plane of principal
curvature:

∆k(s, t) ≡

and in the orthogonal plane:

˙ǫ(ψc(s, t), s, t) − ˙ǫ(ψc(s, t) + π, s, t)

˙E(s, t)

∆⊥(s, t) ≡

˙ǫ(ψc(s, t) + π/2, s, t) − ˙ǫ(ψc(s, t) − π/2, s, t)

˙E(s, t)

.

Note that ∆(φ, s, t) = 0 implies that growth is the same on either side in this plane, while ∆(φ, s, t) = ±1
means that all of the growth occurs on one side of the organ or the other, respectively. We now separate
Equation 1 into an equivalent set of equations considering the dynamics along these two orthogonal planes
(details in Section A 1 in the Appendix):

DtC(s, t)R = (1 − C(s, t)2R2)∆k

˙E(s, t) ∼ ∆k

˙E(s, t)

C(s, t)RDtψc(s, t) = ∆⊥(s, t) ˙E(s, t)

(7)

(8)

As long as the radius of curvature C(s, t)−1 remains large compared to the radius R of the organ, i.e.
C(s, t)R ≪ 1, the quadratic prefactor in Equation 7, (1 − C(s, t)2R2), can be neglected [15].

Equation 7 expresses the variation of curvature as a function of the growth diﬀerential in the plane
of the principal direction of curvature only, and is identical to the equation found in the case of in-plane
curvature [13, 15]. Out of plane curvature is then fully described by the addition of Equation 8, which
expresses the variation of the principal direction of curvature as a function of the diﬀerential growth in
the orthogonal plane.

In order to understand the relation between growth and movement in nutation, only three parameters
are necessary: the relative elongation rate on the median line ˙E(s, t), the growth diﬀerential in the

5

plane of curvature ∆k(s, t), which expresses the curvature variation via Equation 7, and ﬁnally the
diﬀerential growth in the orthogonal plane ∆⊥(s, t), which expresses the change of orientation of the
plane of curvature via Equation 8. Without any loss of generality, it is possible to consider the growth
diﬀerential in the principal direction of growth diﬀerential ∆(ψg(s, t)) , i.e. where the growth diﬀerential
is maximal. The growth diﬀerential in the parallel plane is then described by

and in the orthogonal plane by

∆k(s, t) = ∆(ψg(s, t)) cos(ψg(s, t) − ψc(s, t)),

∆⊥(s, t) = ∆(ψg(s, t)) sin(ψg(s, t) − ψc(s, t)).

(10)

Variation of the principal direction of the growth diﬀerential ψg(s, t) as an internal oscillator

Nutation cannot be driven primarily by external factors such as light and gravity; indeed if the organ
is curved inside a plane parallel to the direction of gravity, the gravitropic movement will be restricted
to that plane [16], meaning that gravitropism alone cannot drive movement observed in the apical plane
(perpendicular to gravity). Moreover nutation can be observed in the absence of light. Therefore,
although external cues may aﬀect the observed oscillatory symmetry-breaking dynamics, an endogeneous
oscillator has to be responsible.

A natural candidate for this endogeneous oscillator is the variation of the principal direction of the
growth diﬀerential ψg(s, t), since it is the only known growth driven process occuring parallel to the
apical plane. To date there are no exact experimental observations of the temporal variation of ψg(t),
however the existence of a linear oscillator seems consistent with measurements made on opposite sides
of an organ [17, 18], where the diﬀerential of growth oscillates periodically from one side to the other.

In summary, the model presented here suggests that nutation results from the slaving of the direction
of maximal curvature,ψc(s, t), to the direction of maximal growth ψg(s, t). Moreover, the model allows to
extract ψg(s, t) and ∆(ψg) ˙E(s, t) from 3D experimental data of the curvature C(s, t) (and therefore also
R and ψc(s, t)). Inverting equations 7 and 8 and substituting equations 9 and 10 leads to the following
relations:

ψg(s, t) − ψc(s, t) = arctan(cid:18) C(s, t)R

DtC(s, t)R

Dtψc(s, t)(cid:19)

(11)

(12)

and

∆(ψg(s, t)) ˙E(s, t) =p(DtC(s, t)R)2 + (C(s, t)RDtψc(s, t))2.

Considering Equations 7 and 8 we note that for an oscillatory movement such as nutation, the direction
of curvature changes over time, i.e. Dtψc(s, t) 6= 0. In absence of compression the median elongation
rate ˙E(s, t) is always positive, and cannot control the direction of ψc(s, t) [15]. Therefore the oscillatory
movement can only be governed by ∆⊥(s, t) and ∆k(s, t).

We now consider two basic cases for the functional form of ψg(s, t), and analyze the ensuing organ
movement. The simplest case is given when the direction of the diﬀerential growth is ﬁxed, ψg(s, t) = ψg.
Here the orientation of the organ is modiﬁed so that the principal direction of curvature ψc(s, t) aligns
with the direction of the growth diﬀerential ψc(s, t) (see Appendix section 2.1). Despite its triviality, this
result sheds light on the behavior of the out-of-plane curvature driven by diﬀerential growth. The organ
tries to align, following the main direction of the growth diﬀerential, i.e. ψc(s, t) → ψg(s, t). As can
be seen from equations 7 and 8, once an organ is aligned, i.e. ψc(s, t) = ψg(s, t), there is no movement
outside of this plane and only bending is observed. This can also be seen in simulations using these
conditions, as shown in Movie S2, where the initial curvature and its principal direction are the same
all along the organ, C(s, 0) = C0 and ψc(s, 0) = ψ0. The details of the simulations can be found in the
caption of Movie S1.

6

We now consider a more complex case, where the orientation of the growth diﬀerential rotates linearly

in time, with an angular frequency ω. The direction of the growth diﬀerential is then given by

ψg(s, t) = ωt.

(13)

In this case an analytical stability analysis can be performed. The movement of a single element displays
a stable orbit, the periodicity of which is given by the direction of the diﬀerential growth ω (see Appendix
section 2.2 and Figure 7 therein). Furthermore the stability and periodicity are independent of the initial
conditions. This means that even when the rotation is not centered around the base of the organ, the
pattern remains stable and the periodicity is still given by the internal oscillator (simulations giving rise
to a circular pattern are shown in Movie S3).

Figure 3. A. The trajectory of the apical tip projected onto the (x, y) plane produces a parametric
curve P (t) = (xa(t), ya(t)). Under the assumptions H1-H3, the position of the apical projection P (t),
gives information on the amplitude and the direction of the plane of curvature, in polar coordinates
(ρ(t), θ(t0)). B. At a given time t0 the organ is considered to be curved with a constant curvature C(t0)
along the organ in a single plane deﬁned by the angle ψ(t0) = θ(t0). The measurement of θ(t), the angle
of the projected apical curve, is then equivalent to ψc(t) C. Inside the plane perpendicular to the apical
plane that contains the organ, the curvature can be measured directly as the value of ρ(t0) (see
Appendix section 3 and 4 for a mathematical justiﬁcation and a description of the approximations).

Existing experimental observations concerning nutation measure the movement of the apical tip in
the apical plane, projected onto the (x, y) plane, in the form of a parametric curve P (t) = (xa(t), ya(t)).
In order to interpret existing data, we analyze the projected movement in the context of our suggested
model. Under the hypotheses H1-H3 measurement in the apical plane should give direct information
on the dynamics of the plant if the shape of the plant is known. According to H1, the simplest case is
considered, where the dynamics does not depend on the local position along the organ, the curvature is the
same along the organ, C(s, t) = C(t) and the entire organ is curved inside the same plane, ψc(s, t) = ψc(t)
. In that case, the material derivative Dt, equation 3 is equivalent to the partial derivative ∂t, as there is no
more dependance in space. The projection of the apical tip in the apical plane (xa(t), ya(t)), or (ρ(t), θ(t))
in polar coordinates (Figure 3), is then a direct approximation of ψc(t) and C(t)) as ψc(t) = θ(t), by
deﬁnition (Figure 3), and C(t) = ρ(t) (see Appendix 3). A direct estimate of the principal direction of
the diﬀerential growth ψg(t) can be obtained from the coordinates (xa(t), ya(t)) of the projection of the
apical tip in the apical plane (see Appendix 4):

as well as an estimate of the growth diﬀerential term (see Appendix 5):

∂tya(t)(cid:19) ,

∆(ψg) ˙E(t) =p∂txa(t)2 + ∂tya(t)2 2R

(15)

where L is the length of the organ. In most of the published data, L is not available, meaning that values
of ∆(ψg) ˙E measured from the apical plane can only be compared qualitatively up to a prefactor. On the
other hand Equation 14 is independent of L, and the principal direction of growth ψg can be measured
quantitatively from the observed pattern.

Figure 4. A. Mechanism underlying a circular pattern: A1. A circular pattern in the plane of the
apical tip deﬁned by (xa, ya). This is realized by a constant diﬀerential growth ∆(ψg)(t) ˙E (A2) and
constant variation of the direction of the diﬀerential growth dtψg(t) (A3) . A simulation of an organ
with these conditions can be found in Movie S3. B and C. Underlying mechanisms for an elliptic
pattern: B1 and C1. An ellipse in the apical plane. This pattern can be realized with a constant
constant ∆(ψg)(t) ˙E (B2) and a periodically varying dtψg(t) which is maximal close to the major axis of
the ellipse (B3). A simulation can be found in Movie S4. Another option is if ∆ ˙E varies periodically and
is maximal close to the major axis of the ellipse (C2), even if dtψg is constant in time (C3). A simulation
is presented in Movie S5. A combination of these two limiting mechanisms will also lead to an ellipse.

In what follows we re-examine existing experimental observations in the context of our model. We
analyze diﬀerent classes of movements recorded in the apical plane, examining possible underlying mech-
anisms. We ﬁrst consider the simulated apical trajectories of the most common observed patterns, the
circle and the ellipse. Figure 4 presents the underlying form of the variation of the principal direction of
growth dtψg(t) and its diﬀerential growth ∆(ψg(t)) ˙E, as imposed by the model via equations 14 and 15.
In the case when the apical tip draws a circle in the apical plane, it follows that dtψg and ∆(ψg(t)) ˙E are

8

constant in time (shown in Figure 4A). In the case of an ellipse, there are two possible mechanisms: (i) a
periodic dtψg(t) with maxima at some ψ0
g + π (Figure 4B), meaning that the direction of diﬀer-
ential growth changes faster on opposite sides of the organ, giving less time for the organ to curve out in
those directions, resulting in a smaller radius at those ends. (ii) a periodic ∆(ψg(t)) ˙E (Figure 4C) with
maxima at some ψ0
g + π/2, meaning that the diﬀerential growth is larger at opposite sides
of the organ, resulting in a greater curvature and therefore also larger radius at those ends (simulations
giving rise to these patterns are given in Movies S3, S4 and S5).

Figure 5. Epi- and hypo-trochoids constructed as a sum of two linear oscillators with angular
frequencies respectively ω1 and ω2. A1 ω2 = 6ω1 and B1 ω2 = −6ω1. Plotting ∂tψg as a funciton of
time is governed by the oscillator with the higher frequency, in this case ω2 (A2 and B2). Simulations of
these patterns are presented in Movies S5, S6 and S7. The analysis of ∂tψg using equation 14 does not
allow to extract accurately the values of ω1 and ω2, but rather gives and eﬀective oscillator.

For the sake of intuition, Figure 4 presents limit cases where either dtψg(t) or ∆(ψg(t)) ˙E are periodic
while the other is constant, however in reality both may be periodic, and their relative magnitude and
shift in phase will dictate the ﬁnal apical pattern. We also note that taking the average value of dtψg(t)
yields the time it takes for the direction of diﬀerential growth to make a full rotation of the organ, i.e.

Tr = 2π/hdtψg(t)i.

(16)

If dtψg(t) itself exhibits periodicity, we expect the time between two maxima to coincide with this period,
since consecutive maxima are expected to be an angle of π apart. Moreover, we note that dtψg(t) and
∆(ψg(t)) ˙E are plotted here as a function of ψg, assuming the organ does not exhibit torsion, i.e. the
rotation of the cotyledon on top of the organ’s movement, in which case the behavior would be shifted
leading to erroneous conclusions. On the other hand a periodic or constant behavior would still be
observed when plotting these values as a function of time. Lastly, as the sign of ∆(ψg)(t) ˙E does not

9

change, one cannot distinguish between variation of the median elongation, which is supposed to be
positive, and variation of the diﬀerential growth term.

Some experimental observations have shown the existence of epi- and hypo-trochoid patterns (spiro-
graph pattern) [10]. These patterns provide an interesting case where the validity of hypothesis H1 (which
assumes no local eﬀects) is put in question. Mathematically, a trochoid is constructed as a sum of linear
oscillators. If two segments of the organ of length L1 and L2 possess diﬀerent temporal behaviors of the
orientation of diﬀerential growth ψg1(t) = ω1t and ψg2(t) = ω2t, a trochoid will then be observed in the
apical plane, as shown in Figure 5, and from the simulations presented in Movies S6 and S7. Applying
equation 14 to the apical curves cannot discern between the two separate oscillators, and will therefore
result in an eﬀective ψg. Furthermore, the sign of the eﬀective ∂tψg is dominated by the faster oscillator.

We now analyze an existing dataset of apical movements of 8 Arabidopsis thaliana plants published

10

by Stolarz et al. [6] (see Figure 6A, B, C and F for examples of measured apical patterns. Most of the
observed patterns are elliptical. We apply equations 14 and 15 on all 8 measurements of the apical tip
in the apical plane (xa, ya), extracting ψg(t) (shown in Figure 6D) and ∆(ψg) ˙E. After ∼ 20 hours most
plants exhibit a linear behavior, equivalent to a constant time derivative ∂tψg(t). Averaging over time
and over the diﬀerent plants restults in h∂tψgi = 4.6 × 10−4 ± 7 × 10−5s−1, and substituting this in
equation 16 results in a the time a full rotation of the diﬀerential growth direction takes, Tr = 230 ± 40
min. At this point we focus on a single curve (plotted in dark blue), where no torsion has been observed.
Examining ∂tψg for closely (plotted in Fig. 6E) we identify oscillations. As mentioned earlier, the model
predicts the maxima to be Tr/2 apart, representing opposite points along the apical curve. Indeed we
ﬁnd that the average time between every other maximum is To = 215 ± 25 min, in agreement with Tr
found from the average value of ∂tψg. Moreover, since this plant does not exhibit torsion, one can plot
∂tψg(t) and ∆(ψg) ˙E as a function of ψg (shown in Fig. 6G and H). As predicted from the model, we ﬁnd
the minima of ∂tψg(t) and the maxima of ∆(ψg) ˙E situated at ψg = ±π/2, representing the farthest sides
of the ellipse (on the right and left).

Discussion

This work presents for the ﬁrst time a rigorous minimal model which quantitatively describes the dy-
namics and kinematics of nutation, making analytical predictions which we verify both numerically and
experimentally.

The principal mechanism at the basis of the model is the slaving of the principal direction of curva-
ture of the plant to the principal direction of growth. Projecting the diﬀerential growth on the planes
parallel and perpendicular to the plane of principal curvature produces two equations. One describes
the dynamics of diﬀerential growth in the plane of principal curvature, consistent with previous work
concerning gravitropism [15]. The other equation relates the orientation of curvature to that of growth
in the perpendicular plane. Within this framework, the full dynamics are described through only three
variables: The amplitude of the curvature is governed by the diﬀerence in growth rate between opposite
sides of the organ ∆(ψg). The orientation of the curvature in space is goverened by the component of
diﬀerential growth in the plane perpendicular to the plane of curvature, given by the principal direction
of growth ψg(t). Lastly, similarly to what we describe for gravitropism [15], the elongation rate on the
median line ˙E controls the time scale of the movement.

Previous experimental work on nutations concentrated on recording the apical movement in the plane
perpendicular to gravity, however the relevance of these observations, in particular the underlying as-
sumptions relating the apical movement to the whole 3D movement of the organ, have been disregarded.
Within the geometrical framework presented here, we are able to discuss this relation for the ﬁrst time,
shedding light on the validity and restrictions associated with such obervations. Moreover, our model
allows to consider apical obersvations as an inverse problem, allowing to relate apical patterns to dynam-
ics of the growth diﬀerential (the motor of the movement), yielding the main variables responsible for
the observed kinematics, and whence also allowing to reconstruct the whole 3D movement of the organ.
We ﬁrst consider major classes of apical patterns, such as the circle, line, ellipse and trochoids, analyti-
cally discussing the underlying characteristic behavior of the variables ψg(t) and ∆(ψg) ˙E. Simple input,
such as an oscillating ψg, can produce robust, stable stereotypical patterns independently of the initial
conditions. We verify these ﬁndings numerically via simulations based on such characeristic variables,
recovering the desired patterns. Finally, we re-examine existing experimental observations of nutations
in the apical plane [6], further verifying predictions made by our model.

We show that patterns observed in the apical plane remain a marker of underlying growth dynam-
ics, but that experimental 3D measurements are needed in order to fully understand the mechanisms
underlying nutation, especially in the case of more intricate apical patterns.

Appendix

1 Geometrical description of curvature variation

To begin, we need a geometrical description of the modiﬁcation of curvature of the organ. For the sake
of simplicity, we start with a cylinder R, with mean length L0. The organ is curved with homogenous
curvature C along the organ. The principal direction of curvature is given by the angle ψc (Figure tor-
sionC). The length of an element running along the surface of the organ at some angle φ, L1(φ), is then
given by

L1(φ) = L0 (1 + CR cos (φ − ψc)) .

(17)

Then a deformation ǫ(φ) applied on the cylinder. The considered deformation is made so that the
radius of the cylinder is constant R with no torsion. The new curvature C′ is now in the direction ψ′
c.
The mean length of the cylinder, L′

0, is given by:

where E is the mean deformation of the cylinder:

L′

0 = L0 (1 + E) ,

E =

1

2π Z π

−π

dωǫ(ω).

(18)

(19)

The compatible solution for ǫ(φ) according to these hypotheses is the basis of the geometrical descrip-

tion of the nutation. After the deformation, the length of each ﬁber L2(φ) on the surface is

and substituting equation 17 yields:

L2(φ) = L1(φ)(1 + ǫ(φ)),

L2(φ) = L′

0 (1 + C′R cos (φ − ψ′

c)) .

(20)

(21)

Rearranging equation 20 and substituting equations 17 and 21, yields an expression for the ﬁeld of
deformation ǫ(φ) that is compatible under the hypothesis of constant radius and homogenous curvature:

ǫ(φ) =

L′
0
L0

1 + C′R cos(φ − ψ′
c)
1 + CR cos(φ − ψc)

− 1.

(22)

To obtain an equation for the dynamics of the curvature variation small deformations are applied

during a time ∆t. One can then approximate:

(ǫ(φ) → ˙ǫ(φ, t)∆t

E → ˙E(t)∆t,

and the curvature and the direction of the maximal curvature are given by

(C(t) → C(t) + ∆C(t)

ψc(t) → ψc(t) + ∆ψc(t)

(23)

(24)

As the variations are considered to be small, terms of second order are dropped, so substituting equa-
tions 18, 23 and 24 into equation 22 yields:

L0(t)(cid:16)1 + ˙E(t)∆t(cid:17) (1 + C(t)R cos (φ − ψc(t)) + C(t)R∆ψc(t) sin (φ − ψc(t)) + ∆C(t)R cos (φ − ψc(t)))

L0(t) (1 + C(t)R cos (φ − ψc(t)))

. (25)

1 + ˙ǫ(φ, t)∆t =

this can be rewritten as:

˙ǫ(φ, t) − ˙E(t) =

C(t)R ∆ψc

∆t sin (φ(t) − ψc(t)) + ∆C(t)R
1 + C(t)R cos (φ − ψc(t))

∆t

cos (φ − ψc(t))

12

.

(26)

In the continuous limit, for small deformations, equation 26 takes the form:

˙ǫ(φ, t) − ˙E(t) =

∂tψc(t)C(t)R sin (φ − ψc(t)) + ∂tC(t)R cos (φ − ψc(t))

1 + C(t)R cos (φ − ψc(t))

.

(27)

When the whole organ is considered the the material derivative Dt which co-moves with each element as
the organ elongates should be taken into account [1, 13, 15]:

Dt = ∂t + v(s, t)∂s,

(28)

where v(s, t) is the velocity of the growth-induced displacement of each element along the median line
of the organ s at time t, and is deﬁned as the integral of the relative elongation rate on the median line
˙E(s, t).

so that the equation 27 can be rewritten

v(s, t) =Z s

0

ds′ ˙E(s′, t).

(29)

.

(30)

˙ǫ(φ, s, t) − ˙E(s, t) =

Dtψc(s, t)C(s, t)R sin (φ − ψc(s, t)) + DtC(s, t)R cos (φ − ψc(s, t))

1 + C(s, t)R cos (φ − ψc(s, t))

We note that ˙ǫ(φ, t) is a function of two components. One component is given by the diﬀerential of
growth in the principal direction of curvature

This component is related to the variation of curvature. The other component is given by the diﬀerential
in the plane orthogonal to the principal direction of curvature

DtC(s, t)R cos (φ − ψc(s, t))

(31)

Dtψc(s, t)C(s, t) sin (φ − ψc(s, t))

(32)

This component is related to the variation of direction of orientation of the plane of curvature. By
looking at the diﬀerential of deformation in the plane of the principal direction of curvature ∆k(s, t) =
˙ǫ(ψc(s, t) + π/2) − ˙ǫ(ψc(s, t) − π/2)
˙ǫ(ψc, s, t) − ˙ǫ(ψc + π, s, t)

, and in the orthogonal plane, ∆⊥(s, t) =

,

˙E(s, t)

˙E(s, t)

it is possible to get a compact expression:

DtC(s, t)R = ∆k(s, t) ˙E(s, t)(1 − C(s, t)2R2)

Dtψc(s, t) = ∆⊥(s, t) ˙E(s, t)

C(s, t)R

.

(33)

(34)

Equation 33 expresses the variation of curvature as a function of the diﬀerential of deformation in the
plane of the principal direction of curvature only. This equation is the classic equation of the variation
of curvature of slendered organs [13, 15]. Equation 34 expresses the variation of the principal direction
of curvature as a function of the diﬀerential growth in the orthogonal plane. It is important to notice
that equation 34 is proportional to the inverse of curvature. The variation of the direction of curvature
is smaller when the organ is curved. To describe nutation, only one new parameter is necessary, ∆⊥. If
the curvature of the organ is considered to be small then 1 − C2R2 ∼ 1 and equation 33 simpliﬁes to:

DtC(s, t)R = ∆k(s, t) ˙E(s, t).

(35)

2 Analysis of the movements induced by the principal direction of growth

Substituting equations 10 and 9 in equations 35 and 34, with the dimensionless variables:

yields the set of equations:

( ˙E(s, t)t → t′

C(s, t)R → C′(s, t),

∂t′ C′(s, t) = cos(ψc(s, t) − ψg(s, t)),

∂t′ ψc(s, t) = −

sin(ψc(s, t) − ψg(s, t))

C′(s, t)

.

(36)

(37)

(38)

Following H1, the dynamics does not depend on the local position along the organ, C′(s, t) → C′(t) and
ψ′
c(t) . In following, in order to simplify the writing of the equation, the prime indices as well
as the dependance in time are dropped The following set of initial conditions is considered:

c(s, t) → ψ′

ψc(0) = ψ0
c

C(0) = C0.

This accounts for an organ curved in a single plane. The following change of variables is considered

and substituting in equations 37 and 38 yields:

∂tC = cos(u)

∂tu − ∂tψg = −

Rearranging equation 43 gives and expression for C:

2.1 Constant principal direction of growth, ψg = 0

In the simplest case, where the principal direction of growth is constant, and arbitrarily chosen to take
the value 0:

resulting in u = ψc, and equation 46 can be rewritten as

ψg = 0,

− 2∂tψc cot ψc +

∂2
t ψc
∂tψc

= 0.

(47)

(48)

Integrating over time yields:

− 2 log (sin ψc) + log (∂tψc) + ˜K1 = 0,

where ˜K1 is an integration constant. Taking an exponential yields:

where K1 = e− ˜K1. An aditional integration over time results in:

∂tψc = K1 sin2 ψc,

where K2 is another integration constant. Rearranging results in:

cot ψc = K1t + K2,

Substituting the initial condition in equation 39

ψc = arctan(cid:18)

1

K1t + K2(cid:19) .

ψc(t = 0) = ψ0

c = arctan(cid:18) 1

K2(cid:19) ,

yields the value of K2:

K2 = cot ψ0
c .

We proceed to extract K1, substituting equation 50 in equation 38:

K1 sin2 ψc = −

Substituting the initial conditions stated in equations 39 and 40 yields:

We now substitute the expressions for K1 and K2 (found in equations 57 and 54) in equation 52, leading
to the ﬁnal expression for ψc(t):

ψc = arctan(cid:18)

cot ψ0

c − t/(C0 sin ψ0

c )(cid:19) .

(58)

Note that for long times, t → ∞, the direction of maximal curvature is equal to the principal direction
of growth, ψc = ψg = 0.

2.2 Temporal linear variation of the principal direction of growth, ψg = ωt

We continue with the linear case

Equation 46 now takes the form:

ψg = ωt.

(−2∂tu + ω) cot u +

∂2
t u

∂tu − ω

= 0.

(59)

(60)

Integrating over time yields (with K ′ is an integration constant):

− 2 log sin u + log (∂tu − ω) = K ′ − ωZ t

cot udt′,

and raising to an exponent and rearranging yields:

where K = eK ′
and 40, leading to:

. We substitute equation 62 in equation 38, and use the initial conditions in equations 39

and rearranging this yields the integration constant K:

K = −

C0 sin ψ0

.

In order to solve the non linear equation 62, the following change of variable is considered:

with

v = cot u,

dv = −

du

sin2u

.

With this change of variables equation 62 now takes the form:

and taking the logarithm yields:

− ω(cid:0)1 + v2(cid:1) ,

∂tv = −K1 e−ωR t vdt′
log(cid:0)∂tv + ω(cid:0)1 + v2(cid:1)(cid:1) = ωZ t

vdt′ + K1.

Taking the derivative of time yields:

and after rearranging:

∂2
t v + 2ωv∂tv
∂tv + ω (1 + v2)

= ωv,

t v + ωv∂tv − ω2v(1 + v2) = 0.
∂2

We now introduce a last change of variables:

leading to the following form:

τ = ωt,

τ v + v∂τ v − v(1 + v2) = 0.
∂2

This equation is then the solution, where we remind that v = cot (ψc − ψg). The phase ﬁeld of this
equation is given for diﬀerent values of the initial condition. Stable orbits are observed in Figure S1. The
movement of a single element displays a stable orbit, the periodicity of which is given by the direction
of the diﬀerential growth ω. Furthermore the stability and periodicity are independent of the initial
conditions. This means that even when the rotation is not centered around the base of the organ, the
pattern remains stable and the periodicity is still given by the internal oscillator.

16

Figure S1.The solutions of equation 72 are represented in the space (v, ∂τ v), for the following initial
conditions blue v = 0.05, yellow v = 0.1, green v = 0.2, red v = 0.5, dark blue v = 1 . Orbits are
observed and are all travelled during a time τ = 2π. This means that after a time τ = 2π, the system
comes back to the same initial condition. The orbits are then stable are the same pattern will be
displayed at longer times. As v becomes bigger, it i.e. the phase between ψg and ψc is diﬀerent from
π/2 the dynamics is not symmetrical anymore. However the pattern observed in the apical plane
remain the same (e.g. compared MovieS2 and S3)

Figure S2.Deﬁnition of the variables used to measure the curvature in the apical plane. The organ is
considered to have a constant curvature C so that the point M on the rho abscissa is the center of the
circle described by the organ. The distance from M to the apical tip, (ρa, za) in the plane (ρ, z), or to
the basis of the organ,(0,0), is the radius of curvature 1/C.

3 Measuring the curvature C from the base-apex distance in the apical plane

ρa

Existing experimental measurements are usually restricted to the apical plane, therefore disregarding
important information concerning the conformation of the whole shoot, needed for the analysis presented
here. In what follows we show that one can recover the curvature of the shoot C (assumed here to be
constant along the shoot) from ρa, the distance of the apex point from the base in the apical plane, as
depicted in Fig. 3C. This can be done through a purely geometric argument, whose details appear in
Figure S2.

Assuming a constant curvature C along the shoot, we can consider the shoot an arc, part of a circle.
The radius of this circle is the inverse of the curvature by deﬁnition R = 1/C, and the length of the arc
is just L the length of the shoot. We can therefore calculate the angle deﬁned by the arc, γ.

γ = LC.

(73)

Drawing a straight line between the base and apex, we now have an isosceles triangle with equal base
angles α and the third angle positioned at the center of the circle of size γ. Therefore the sum of angles
yields:

2α + γ = π/2

(74)

The angle between this base-apex line and the projection of the apex to the ρa axis is denoted beta,
deﬁning a right angle triangle, i.e.:

Substituting equation 75 in equation 74 results in;

α + β = π/2.

By deﬁnition,

and substituting equations 76 and 73 yields:

γ = 2β.

where A is a prefactor that depends on L2/2.

4 Measuring ψc in the apical plane and its relation to ψg

The orientation of the principal direction of curvature of an organ is deﬁned in the apical plane

The diﬀerential element dψc is then given by

The distance from the apex to the base in the apical plane, ρa, is deﬁned by the position of the apex in
that plane, (xa, ya), and substituting equation 79 results in:

A2C2 = ρ2

a = x2

a + y2

The diﬀerential is then:

A2CdC = xadxa + yadya.

where we note that the prefactor A has cancelled out. Dividing equation 38 by equation 37 results in:

and substituting equations 82 and 85 yields:

ψg − ψc = arctan(cid:18) C∂tψc
∂tC (cid:19) ,

ψg − ψc = arctan(cid:18) dxa/dya − xa/ya

(dxa/dya) (xa/ya) + 1(cid:19) .

(86)

(87)

We now use the identity arctan(cid:16) u−v

uv+1(cid:17) = arctan (u) − arctan (v), and substituting equation 80, yields:

This can be expressed in terms of the temporal derivative of xa and ya, ﬁnally yielding equation 14 in
the main text:

ψg = arctan(cid:18) dxa
dya(cid:19) .

∂tya(t)(cid:19) .
ψg(t) = arctan(cid:18) ∂txa(t)

5 Measuring ∆(ψg) ˙E in the apical plane
Substituting equations 82, 83 and 84 into equation 12, we obtain the following relation

and after rearranging

∆(ψg(s, t)) ˙E(s, t) = A−1Rp∂txa(t)2 + ∂tya(t)2.
