We actively stabilize the harmonic oscillation frequency of a laser-cooled atomic ion conﬁned in a rf Paul trap
by sampling and rectifying the high voltage rf applied to the trap electrodes. We are able to stabilize the 1
MHz atomic oscillation frequency to better than 10 Hz, or 10 ppm. This represents a suppression of ambient
noise on the rf circuit by 34 dB. This technique could impact the sensitivity of ion trap mass spectrometry
and the ﬁdelity of quantum operations in ion trap quantum information applications.

INTRODUCTION

Charged particles are often controlled with radiofre-
quency (rf) electrical potentials, whose ﬁeld gradients
provide time-averaged (ponderomotive) forces that form
the basis for applications such as quadrupole mass ﬁl-
ters, ion mass spectrometers, and rf (Paul) ion traps1,2.
These rf potentials, typically hundreds or thousands of
volts at frequencies ranging from 1kHz to 100 MHz, drive
high impedance loads in vacuum and are usually gener-
ated with rf ampliﬁers and resonant step-up transform-
ers such as quarter-wave or helical resonators3. Such cir-
cuitry is susceptible to ﬂuctuations in ampliﬁer gain, me-
chanical vibrations of the transformer, and temperature
drifts in the system. Ion traps are particularly sensitive
to these ﬂuctuations, because the rf potential determines
the harmonic oscillation frequency of the trapped ions.
Stable trap frequencies are crucial in applications rang-
ing from quantum information processing4,5 and quan-
tum simulation6,7 to the preparation of quantum states
of atomic motion8, atom interferometry9, and quantum-
limited metrology10.

Actively stabilizing rf ion trap potentials requires the
faithful sampling of the rf potential. Probing the signal
directly at the electrodes is diﬃcult in a vacuum envi-
ronment and can load the circuit or spoil the resonator
quality factor. On the other hand, sampling the poten-
tial too far upstream is not necessarily accurate, owing
to downstream inductance and capacitance. Here we ac-
tively stabilize the oscillation frequency of a trapped ion
by noninvasively sampling and rectifying the high voltage
rf potential between the step-up transformer and the vac-
uum feedthrough leading to the ion trap electrodes. We
use this signal in a feedback loop to regulate the rf input
amplitude to the circuit. We stabilize a 1 MHz trapped
ion oscillation frequency to < 10 Hz after 200 s of in-
tegration, representing a 34 dB reduction in the level of
trap frequency noise and drift, over a locking bandwidth
of up to 30 kHz.

The ion is trapped in a linear rf trap, which consists
of a two-dimensional rf quadrupole electric ﬁeld super-
posed with a static quadrupole electric ﬁeld to provide
conﬁnement along the longitudinal direction11. Longitu-
dinal conﬁnement is typically set much weaker than the

FIG. 1. Linear Paul trap created with four gold-plated blade
electrodes that are held in place by an insulating mount. An
ion is conﬁned in between the electrodes through a combina-
tion of rf and static potentials applied to the electrodes. Each
blade is split longitudinally into 5 segments that are electri-
cally isolated on the static blades and electrically connected
on the rf blades. The transverse distance from the ion axis to
each electrode is R = 200 µm, and the length of the central
longitudinal segments is 400 µm.

transverse conﬁnement, so that a crystal of laser-cooled
ions can reside along the x = y = 0 rf ﬁeld null without
feeling the eﬀects of rf-induced micromotion1. The trans-
verse conﬁnement, dictated by the rf ﬁelds, is used for
many applications because motion along these directions
is at higher frequency and the normal mode spectrum for
a chain of ions can be tuned12. Linear ion traps exist in
a variety of topologically equivalent electrode conﬁgura-
tions, even with electrodes all in a single plane for ease
in lithographic fabrication13.

The linear trap used in this experiment has four gold-
plated ceramic “blade” electrodes with their edges run-

stabilizes the ratio V0/Ω and the upper feedback loop
(purple) locks the variable rf oscillator frequency to the
resonance of the transformer, which might drift due to
mechanical or temperature ﬂuctuations. The main diﬃ-
culty with this approach is the required performance of
the digital divider circuit, which must have a precision as
good as the desired stability, and be fast enough to sta-
blize the system at at the desired bandwidth. Moreover,
higher order corrections to the trap frequency beyond the
psuedopotental expression of Eq. 1 depend on terms that
do not scale simply as the ratio V0/Ω. Therefore, we in-
stead stabilize the rf potential amplitude V0 alone, and
use a ﬁxed frequency rf oscillator and passively stable
transformer circuit, as depicted in Fig. 2b.

because they are relatively small and stable.

One approach to stabilize the ion oscillation frequency
is to control the ratio V0/Ω, in cases where the rf drive
frequency is itself dithered to maintain resonance with
the step-up transformer. A feedback system of this style
is shown in Fig. 2a, where the lower feedback loop (red)

II. TRAP RF STABILIZATION

We stabilize the rf conﬁnement potential by sampling
the high voltage rf signal supplying the ion trap electrode
and feeding it back to a frequency mixer that controls
the upstream rf oscillator amplitude. As shown in the
schematic of Fig. 2b, an rf signal at Ω/2π = 17 MHz
and −8dBm is produced by a function generator (SRS
DS345) and sent through the Local Oscillator (LO) port
of a level 3 frequency mixer (Mini-Circuits ZX05-1L-S),
with a conversion loss of 5.6 dB. The rf port of the mixer
is connected to a rf ampliﬁer (Mini-Circuits TVA-R5-13)

tifying circuit is mounted inside a brass housing (Crystek
Corporation SMA-KIT-1.5MF) as shown in Fig. 4b. The
sampling circuit has a bandwidth of ∼ 500 kHz, limited
by the 5 kΩ/68 pF RC ﬁlter. The ratio of dc output
voltage to rf input voltage amplitude, including the ca-
pacitive divider, is 1 : 250 at a drive frequency of 17 MHz,
1 : 330 at 100 MHz, and 1 : 870 at a drive frequency of 1
MHz.

The dc rectiﬁed signal is compared to a stable set-
point voltage (Linear Technology LTC6655 5V reference
mounted on a DC2095A-C evaluation board) with vari-
able control (Analog Devices EVAL-AD5791 and ADSP-
BF527 interface board), giving 20-bit set-point precision
and ±0.25ppm stability. The diﬀerence between these
inputs – the error signal – is then ampliﬁed with propor-
tional and integral gain (New Focus LB1005 servo con-
troller) and fed back to regulate the upstream rf oscillator
amplitude via the frequency mixer described above. Fig-
ure 5 shows the response of the system for various servo
controller gain settings when signals over a range of fre-
quencies are injected into the system at the ampliﬁer in-
put. The overall frequency response of the feedback loop
is limited to a bandwidth of 30 kHz, consistent with the
linewidth Ω/(2πQU ) of the helical resonator transformer.

ION OSCILLATION FREQUENCY

We next characterize the rf amplitude stabilization sys-
tem by directly measuring the transverse motional os-
cillation frequency of a single atomic 171Yb+ ion con-
ﬁned in the rf trap. We perform optical Raman side-
band spectroscopy8 on the |F = 0, mf = 0(cid:105) ≡ |↓(cid:105) and
|F = 1, mf = 0(cid:105) ≡ |↑(cid:105) “clock” hyperﬁne levels of the
2S1/2 electronic ground state of 171Yb+. This atomic
transition has a frequency splitting of ω0/2π = 12.642815
GHz and acquires frequency-modulated sidebands at
ω0 ± ω due to the harmonic motion of the ion in the
trap, with ω/2π ∼ 1 MHz. Before each measurement,
the ion is Doppler cooled on the 2S1/2 to 2P1/2 electronic
transition at a wavelength of 369.5 nm8. The ion is next
prepared in the |↓(cid:105) state through optical pumping, and
following the sideband spectroscopy described below, the
state (|↓(cid:105) or |↑(cid:105)) is measured with state-dependent ﬂuo-
rescence techniques15.

The oscillation frequency is determined by performing
Ramsey spectroscopy16 on the upper (blue) vibrational
sideband of the clock transition at frequency ω0 + ω. Be-
cause the atomic clock frequency ω0 is stable and accu-
rate down to a level better than 1 Hz, drifts and noise
on the sideband frequency are dominated by the oscil-
lation frequency ω. The sideband is driven by a stimu-
lated Raman process from two counter-propagating laser
light ﬁelds with a beatnote ωL tuned near the upper vi-
brational sideband frequency17,18. Following the usual
Ramsey interferometric procedure16, two π/2 pulses sep-
arated by time τ = 0.4 ms drive the Raman transition.
After the pulses are applied, the probability of ﬁnding

with a self-contained cooling system, providing a gain
of 38 dB. The ampliﬁer signal is fed into an antenna
that inductively couples to a 17 MHz quarter-wave helical
resonator and provides impedance matching between the
rf source and the circuit formed by the resonator and
ion trap electrode capacitance3. The antenna, resonator,
and equivalent ion trap capacitance Ctrap are shown in
Fig. 3, and exhibit an unloaded quality factor QU ∼ 600.
A capacitive divider samples roughly 1% of the heli-
cal resonator output, using C1 = 0.2 pF and C2 = 20
pF ceramic capacitors (Vishay’s QUAD HIFREQ Series)
with temperature coeﬃcients of 0 ± 30 ppm/◦C. With
C1 (cid:28) Ctrap and residual inductance between the divider
and the trap electrodes much smaller than the resonator
inductance itself, the divider faithfully samples the rf po-
tential within a few centimeters of the trap electrodes and
does not signiﬁcantly load the trap/transformer circuit.
The capacitors are surface-mounted to a milled copper-
clad epoxy circuit board and installed inside the shielded
resonator cavity, as diagrammed in Fig. 3.

The sampled signal passes through a rectiﬁer circuit
(Fig.
4a) consisting of two Schottky diodes (Avago
HMPS-2822 MiniPak) conﬁgured for passive tempera-
ture compensation14 and a low-pass ﬁlter giving a ripple
amplitude 10 dB below the diode input signal amplitude.
High quality foil resistors and ceramic capacitors are used
to reduce the eﬀect of temperature drifts. The entire rec-

amplitude-modulated at frequencies swept from 4 Hz to 100

observed overall loop bandwidth of ∼30 kHz is consistent with
the linewidth of the helical resonator transformer.

the ion in the |↑(cid:105) state P (δ) = (1 + C cos τ δ)/2 is sam-
pled, where δ = ωL − (ω0 + ω) is the detuning of the
beatnote from the sideband and C is the contrast of the
Ramsey fringes. The Ramsey experiment is repeated 150
times for each value of δ in order to observe the Ramsey
fringe pattern P (δ) and track the value of ω. Because
this Raman transition involves a change in the motional
quantum state of the ion, the Ramsey fringe contrast
depends on the purity and coherence of atomic motion.
For short Ramsey times, the measured contrast of ∼ 0.8
is limited by the initial thermal distribution of motional
quantum states, and for Ramsey times τ > 0.5 ms, the
fringe contrast degrades further (Fig. 6), which is con-
sistent with a decoherence timescale (2¯n0 ˙¯n)−1 for initial
thermal state ¯n0 = 15 quanta and motional heating rate
˙¯n = 100 quanta/s19.

Through Ramsey spectroscopy, we sample the ion trap
oscillation frequency ω at a rate of 2.1 Hz for 80 minutes
with no feedback on the rf potential, and then for another
80 minutes while actively stabilizing the rf potential. A
typical time record of the the measurements over these
160 minutes is shown in Fig. 7. Feedback control clearly
improves the stability of the ion oscillation frequency,
and we observe a > 30 dB suppression of drifts over long

with a minimum uncertainty of better than 10 Hz, or 10
ppm, representing a 34 dB suppression of ambient noise
and drifts. Without feedback, the trap frequency devia-
tion drifts upward with integration time. For integration
times shorter than 7 s, there is not suﬀcient signal/noise
in the measurements to see the eﬀects of feedback stabi-
lization. However, as shown in Fig. 5, the lock is able to
respond to error signals up to a bandwidth of ∼ 30 kHz,
and we expect signiﬁcant suppression of noise at these
higher frequencies as well. Although the Allan deviation
of the oscillation frequency in the stabilized system im-
proves with longer averaging time as expected, it drifts
upward for a period just after T = 50 s. We conﬁrm
this drift appears in the ion oscillation frequency ω and
not the driving ﬁeld ωL or the ion hyperﬁne splitting ω0
by performing the same experiment on the clock “car-
rier” transition near beatnote frequency ωL = ω0 instead
of the upper sideband ωL = ω0 + ω. As shown in Fig.
8, the measured Allan deviation of the carrier continues
downward beyond T = 50 s, meaning that the ion os-
cillation frequency is indeed the limiting factor at long
times.

IV. LIMITS AND NOISE SOURCES

It should be possible to stabilize the rf trap frequency
much better than the observed 10 ppm by improving
passive drifts outside of feedback control. These include
the capacitive divider that samples the rf, the rectiﬁer,
the stable voltage reference, rf source frequency, and cer-
tain cables in the rf circuitry. Most of these components
will have residual drifts with temperature, mechanical
strains, or other uncontrolled noise. Below is a table of
all crucial components outside of feedback control and
their estimated contribution to the instability.

The main contribution is likely the capacitive divider,
which is comprised of two capacitors each with a tem-
perature coeﬃcient of ± 30 ppm/◦C. Given the volt-
age divider conﬁguration, the net temperature coeﬃ-
cient can range from ∼ 0 − 60 ppm/◦C depending on
how well the capacitors are matched. Instabilities in the
rectiﬁer can arise from variability in the junction resis-
tance of the diodes. In series with a 5 kΩ resistor, the
∼ 0.01Ω/◦C junction resistance gives a net temperature
coeﬃcient of about 0.2 ppm/◦C in the rectiﬁer response.
This is roughly equal to the temperature coeﬃcient of
the resistors used in the rectiﬁer circuit. By using the
temperature-stabilized circuit shown in Fig. 4, we esti-
mate the net temperature coeﬃcient of the rectiﬁer re-
sponse is reduced to ∼ 0.1 ppm/◦C.

Performance of the circuit is also helped by passively
stabilizing components within the feedback loop as much
as possible, such as temperature regulating the rf ampli-
ﬁer which feeds the resonator and using a passive mixer
instead of a powered voltage variable attenuator. The he-
lical transformer is particularly sensitive to temperature
ﬂuctuations and mechanical vibrations, which alters the
resonance frequency and quality factor.
(Ensuring the
helical coil is sealed against air currents can be more im-
portant than correcting small drifts in ambient tempera-
ture.) If the resonant frequency of the transformer drifts
too far, then a feedback circuit with a ﬁxed frequency
source (as used here and shown in Fig. 2b) will call for
more input power, and the servo system could possibly
run away and become unstable. However, the resulting
impedance mismatch from the oﬀ-resonant coupling will
cause the servo to maintain the same amount of dissi-
pated power in the resonator3 and not necessarily aﬀect
further drifts. In any case, we do not observe such servo
runaway.
