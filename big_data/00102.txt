IMPLICIT-EXPLICIT LINEAR MULTISTEP METHODS FOR STIFF KINETIC

EQUATIONS

GIACOMO DIMARCO∗ AND LORENZO PARESCHI†

Abstract. We consider the development of high order asymptotic-preserving linear multistep methods for
kinetic equations and related problems. The methods are ﬁrst developed for BGK-like kinetic models and then
extended to the case of the full Boltzmann equation. The behavior of the schemes in the Navier-Stokes regime
is also studied and compatibility conditions derived. We show that, compared to IMEX Runge-Kutta methods,
the IMEX multistep schemes have several advantages due to the absence of coupling conditions and to the greater
computational eﬃciency. The latter is of paramount importance when dealing with the time discretization of
multidimensional kinetic equations.

Keywords: Implicit-Explicit linear multistep methods, Boltzmann equation, stiﬀ diﬀerential

equations, compressible Navier-Stokes limit, asymptotic preserving schemes.

1. Introduction. The development of robust numerical methods for the solution of kinetic
equations with stiﬀ collision terms has been a very active ﬁeld of research in the recent years
[3, 5, 10, 12, 14, 13, 21, 32, 33, 39]. Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta methods and exponential
schemes have provided eﬀective computational tools to solve such equations in stiﬀ regimes [6, 15,
16, 20, 29, 36, 37, 23, 34]. For a comprensive introduction to the subject we refer the reader to the
recent survey [18].

This paper is the natural continuation of this research direction on eﬀective numerical meth-
ods for stiﬀ kinetic equations and considers the development of IMEX multistep methods for
Boltzmann-type equations. IMEX multistep methods were originally proposed in [2] and subse-
quently further developed and studied in [19, 22, 30, 31]. Comparison between IMEX multistep
methods and IMEX Runge-Kutta methods were presented in [30]. Let us also mention that fully
implicit multistep methods for BGK equations were considered in [26].

We consider kinetic equations of the form [11]

∂tf + v · ∇xf =

ε

Q(f ),

(1.1)

where ε is the Knudsen number a non dimensional quantity directly proportional to the mean free
pat between particles. Here f (x, v, t) is a non negative function describing the time evolution of
the distribution of particles with velocity v ∈ Rdv , dv ≥ 1 and position x ∈ Ω ⊂ Rdx, dx ≥ 1 at
time t > 0.
For notation simplicity in the sequel we will omit the dependence of f from the independent
variables x, v, t unless strictly necessary. The operator Q(f ) characterizes the particles interactions,
in the case of the quadratic Boltzmann collision operator of rareﬁed gas dynamics Q(f ) = QB(f, f )
where for dv ≥ 2 we have

QB(f, f ) = ZRdv ×Sdv −1

B(|v − v∗|, n)[f (v′)f (v′

time t deﬁned as

(ρ, ρu, E)T = hφfi,

T =

dvρ

(E − ρ|u|2).

(1.7)

Due to its computational complexity, the Boltzmann collision operator QB(f, f ) is often replaced in
applications by simpler operators, like the BGK operator which substitutes the binary interactions
with a relaxation towards the equilibrium of the form [4]

QBGK(f ) = µ(M [f ] − f ),

(1.8)

where µ > 0 is usually assumed to be proportional to the macroscopic density ρ(x, t). The validity
of this operator in describing the physics of non equilibrium phenomena has been the subject of
many papers in the past [4, 8, 11].

In this paper, we ﬁrst consider the development of IMEX multistep methods for BGK-like
kinetic models, namely models for which the implicit solution of the stiﬀ collision term can be
solved explicitly and therefore will not increase the overall computational cost of the scheme. Next
we extend the schemes to the case of the full Boltzmann equation by adopting a penalization
strategy analogous to the one introduced in [16, 17, 20, 34] for Runge-Kutta and exponential
methods. In particular, we analyze the behavior of the schemes in the Navier-Stokes regime and
show that the methods are capable to described correctly this asymptotic behavior. We emphasize
that a similar analysis for IMEX Runge-Kutta and exponential methods is still lacking. We refer
to [3, 20] for some consistency results with the Navier-Stokes regime for some simple one step
methods. In addition, compared to IMEX Runge-Kutta methods, the IMEX multistep schemes
have several advantages due to the absence of coupling conditions and to the greater computational
eﬃciency. The latter is of paramount importance when dealing with the time discretization of
multidimensional kinetic equations. On the other hand a particular care should be used in the
choice of the penalization factor for high order methods due to the stronger stability constraints
in comparison with IMEX Runge-Kutta methods and exponential methods.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First in Section 2 we recall some basic aspects
on kinetic equations and their ﬂuid dynamic limits. The notion of asymptotic preservation is
also introduced.
In Section 3, we consider IMEX linear multistep schemes applied to kinetic
equations and derive conditions for asymptotic preservation and asymptotic accuracy in Navier-
Stokes regimes. Next, in section 4 we introduce the penalized IMEX linear multistep schemes for the
full Boltzmann model. We analyze their asymptotic preservation and the behavior in the Navier-
Stokes regime. Monotonicity in the homogeneous case and stability of the penalized approach are
also discussed. Finally, in Section 5, several numerical examples conﬁrms our theoretical ﬁndings.
Some concluding remarks are reported in Sections 6.

2. Hydrodynamic limits and asymptotic-preserving methods. For notation simplicity
in this Section we consider only the case dv = 3. Integrating (1.1) against the collision invariants
in the velocity space leads to the following set of non closed conservations laws

∂thφfi + divxhv ⊗ φfi = 0.

(2.1)

Close to ﬂuid regimes, the mean free path between two collisions is very small. In this situation,
passing to the limit ε → 0 we formally obtain Q(f ) = 0 from (1.1) and so f = M [f ]. Thus, at
least formally, we recover the closed hyperbolic system of compressible Euler equations

∂tU + divxF (U ) = 0

(2.2)

with U = hφM [f ]i = (ρ, ρu, E)T and
F (U ) = hv ⊗ φM [f ]i = 

p = ρT, T =

where I is the identity matrix. Note that the above conclusions are independent on the partic-
ular choice of Q(f ) provided it satisﬁes (1.4) and admits Maxwellian of the form (1.6) as local
equilibrium functions.

For small but non zero values of the Knudsen number, the evolution equation for the moments
can be derived by the so-called Chapman-Enskog expansion [7, 11]. This originates the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations as a second order approximation with respect to ε to the solution of the
Boltzmann equation

with

∂tU + divxF (U ) = ε divxD(∇xU )

and the viscosity ν and the thermal conductivity κ are deﬁned according to the linearized Boltz-
mann operator with respect to the local Maxwellian [11, 24]. The Prandtl number is the ratio
P r = 5ν/(2κ). Note that, the particular choice of the collision operator Q(f ) inﬂuences the
structure of the limiting Navier-Stokes system in terms of the corresponding Prandtl number
[7, 8, 9, 11, 24].

The construction of numerical schemes which are capable to capture the Euler limit just de-
scribed is closely connected with the notion of asymptotic-preserving schemes. Here, in agreement
with [32, 36] we give the following deﬁnition of asymptotic preserving methods for equation (1.1)
Definition 2.1. A consistent time discretization method for (1.1) of stepsize ∆t is asymptotic
preserving (AP) if, independently of the initial data and of the stepsize ∆t, in the limit ε → 0
becomes a consistent time discretization method for the reduced system (2.2).
This deﬁnition does not imply that the scheme preserves the order of accuracy in time in the
stiﬀ limit ε → 0. In the latter case we will say that the scheme is asymptotically accurate (AA).
One of the main question which is left open by the above deﬁnition is the behavior of the numerical
method in the Navier-Stokes regime.

3. IMEX linear multistep schemes for kinetic equations. First we introduce the general
formulation of IMEX linear multistep schemes for kinetic equations together with some preliminary
deﬁnitions.

implicit-explicit Adams methods, for which a0 = −1, aj = 0, j = 1, . . . , s − 1.
Let us recall that an order p scheme is obtained provided that

Moreover the following theorem holds true [2]

IMEX multistep schemes of order s.

Theorem 3.1. For the s-step IMEX scheme (3.1) we have
1. If p ≤ s the 2p + 1 constraints of (3.2) are linearly independent, therefore there exist s-step
2. A s-step IMEX multistep scheme has accuracy at most s.
3. The family of s-step IMEX multistep schemes of order s has s parameters.
In the sequel we will make use of the following vector notation

where a = (a0, . . . , as−1)T , b = (b0, . . . , bs−1)T , c = (c0, . . . , cs−1)T , F = (f n, . . . , f n−s+1)T ,
L(F ) = (v · ∇xf n, . . . , v · ∇xf n−s+1)T , and Q(F ) = (Q(f n), . . . , Q(f n−s+1))T are s-dimensional
vectors. In Table 3.1 we report some examples of IMEX multistep schemes [2, 30].
Remark 1. An interesting feature of IMEX-BDF schemes is that they can be rewritten in

splitting form as

where the collision step (3.5) corresponds to a simple application of the backward Euler scheme,
whereas the multistep approach is now limited to the transport step (3.4).

3.1. Asymptotic preserving IMEX multistep schemes. In this section we give condi-
tions for an IMEX multistep scheme to satisfy asymptotic preservation and asymptotic accuracy.
Here we do not consider the computational challenges related to the inversion of the implicit
collision operator Q(f ). We will focus on these aspects in Section 4.

We can state the following theorem which show that BDF-IMEX schemes are asymptotic
preserving and asymptotically accurate. In order to do this we ﬁrst introduce the notion of vector
of initial steps consistent with the limit problem.

Definition 3.2. The vector of initial steps F in the IMEX multistep scheme (3.3) is said

consistent or well-prepared if

f n−j(x, v) = M [f n−j(x, v)] + gn−j

ε

(x, v),

lim
ε→0

gn−j
ε

(x, v) = 0,

j = 0, . . . s − 1.

(3.6)

The above deﬁnition is satisﬁed, for example, using an asymptotic-preserving IMEX Runge-Kutta
scheme of the type developed in [16] as initializing method.

Theorem 3.3.

If the vector of initial steps is well-prepared, in the limit ε → 0, scheme
(3.3) becomes the explicit multistep scheme characterized by (a, b) applied to the limit Euler system
(2.2).

Proof

collision invariant vector φ(v) = (1, v, 1

To prove the above theorem let us ﬁrst multiply the IMEX multistep scheme (3.3) by the
2|v|2)T and integrate the result in velocity space. We obtain

Now let us rewrite equation (3.3) in the following form

εf n+1 = −εaT · F − ε∆t bT · L(F ) + ∆t cT · Q(F ) + ∆t c−1Q(f n+1),

which, as ε → 0 reduces to

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)
Since the initial steps are well-prepared, as ε → 0 we get f n−j = M [f n−j], j = 0, . . . , s − 1 which
implies Q(F ) ≡ 0 and therefore since c−1 6= 0 we have

0 = cT · Q(F ) + c−1Q(f n+1).

Q(f n+1) = 0 ⇒ f n+1 = M [f n+1].

(3.10)

Thus (3.7) becomes the explicit multistep method applied to the limiting Euler system (2.2)

where

✷

Note that for an IMEX-BDF scheme we have c ≡ 0 and therefore, even for non well-prepared
initial conditions, in the limit ε → 0 equation (3.9) reduces to Q(f n+1) = 0 and the distribution
function is projected over the equilibrium f n+1 → M [f n+1]. Thus, after s time steps, the IMEX-
BDF scheme becomes equivalent to the explicit multistep scheme (3.11).

Thus, we can state
Theorem 3.4. For arbitrary initial steps an IMEX-BDF scheme, in the limit ε → 0, after s
time steps becomes the explicit multistep scheme characterized by (a, b) applied to the limit Euler
system (2.2).

Remark 2. For IMEX-BDF schemes, in case the initial steps are not well-prepared the
layer which gives rise to a reduction of accuracy in
numerical solution may exhibit an initial
the numerical solution. This phenomena can be cured using smaller time steps or extrapolation
techniques only for the very ﬁrst steps of the computation.

Finally, let us consider the property of the schemes to preserve a stationary state of the system.
In the ﬁeld of PDEs this is usually referred as well-balanced property and involves not only the
time discretization of the system but also the space discretization (see [25] for a recent survey on
the topic). More precisely, a desirable property of multistep IMEX schemes is that they preserve
a steady state solution such that

εv · ∇xf = Q(f ),

(3.13)

for a ﬁxed value of ε. It is easy to show the following result.

Theorem 3.5. If the vector of initial steps is well-balanced, namely F = f ne with εv·∇xf n =
Q(f n), then the multistep IMEX scheme (3.3) preserves the steady state solution or equivalently
f n+1 = f n.

6

Proof
It is enough to observe that under the assumptions we have

εL(F ) = Q(F )

or ε(v · ∇xf n)e = Q(f n)e with e = (1, . . . , 1)T . We can write
∆t
ε

c−1Q(f n+1) = −aT · f ne −

f n+1 −

∆t
ε

(bT − cT ) · Q(f n)e,

since from the order conditions aT · e = −1, c−1 + cT · e = bT · e the conclusion follows.

✷

3.2. IMEX linear multistep schemes for relaxation operators. In this paragraph we
consider the particular case of BGK relaxation operators of the form QBGK(f ) = µ(M [f ] − f ),
where µ = µ(x, t) depends only on the macroscopic quantities. A fundamental property of the
IMEX scheme (3.3) applied to relaxation operators is that it can be solved explicitly despite the
nonlinearity of M [f ].

In this case (3.3) takes the form

f n+1 = −aT · F − ∆t bT · L(F ) +
c−1µn+1(M [f n+1] − f n+1), (3.14)
where M = diag{µn, . . . , µn−s+1} and M [F ] = (M [f n], . . . , M [f n−s+1])T , which can be rewritten
as

cT · M(M [F ] − F ) +

ε + c−1µn+1∆t (cid:0)cT · M(M [F ] − F ) + c−1µn+1M [f n+1](cid:1)

∆t

(3.15)

where the only implicit term is µn+1M [f n+1] which depends only on the moments hφf n+1i. If we
now integrate equation (3.14) against the collision invariants thanks to the conservations (1.4) we
obtain the explicit moment scheme (3.7). Thus hφf n+1i, and so µn+1M [f n+1], can be explicitly
evaluated and the numerical solution (3.15) can be directly computed.

3.2.1. The space-homogeneous case. Monotonicity properties for IMEX linear multistep
schemes have been studied in [22, 30, 31]. Here, we restrict our analysis to the space homogeneous
case (L(f ) = 0) by focusing on two properties which are of particular interest for kinetic equations,
namely non negativity of the solution and entropy inequality. As we will see, even in this simpliﬁed
setting, the resulting conditions for implicit linear multistep schemes are rather restrictive.

In the homogeneous case the method reduces to a simple application of the implicit scheme

and reads

f n+1 = −λaT · F + (1 − λ)(cid:18) cT

c−1 · (M [F ] − F ) + M [f n+1](cid:19)

(3.16)

where we have set e = (1, . . . , 1)T , λ = ε/(ε + c−1µ∆t) ∈ [0, 1) and we used the fact that in the
homogeneous case the Maxwellian M [f ] and µ are independent of time. If we now deﬁne z = µ∆t/ε
we have λ = 1/(1 + c−1z) and we can state the following

Note that conditions (3.17) must be interpreted component by component. In particular, (3.17)
depend on z and originates the time step restriction. For BDF schemes cT ≡ 0 and conditions
reduce to aj ≤ 0, ∀ j which are never satisﬁed except for the ﬁrst order backward Euler method
which is the unique method unconditionally monotone. For Adams Moulton methods conditions
(3.17) become z ≤ 1/c0, c0 > 0 and cj ≤ 0, j = 1, . . . , s − 1. Examples of methods satisfying
these restrictions are the popular Cranck-Nicolson scheme aT = (−1, 0), cT = (1/2, 0), c−1 = 1/2
for z ≤ 2, and the third order scheme aT = (−1, 0, 0)T , cT = (2/3,−1/12, 0)T , c−1 = 5/12 for
z ≤ 3/2. Implicit Adams schemes of order higher then third never satisfy cj ≤ 0, j = 1, . . . , s − 1.
Another example of second order nonnegative method is the implicit part of IMEX-SG2 scheme
aT = (−3/4, 0,−1/4), cT = (0, 0, 1/2), c−1 = 1 for z ≤ 1/2.

Let us remark that since from the ﬁrst order conditions aT · e = −1 we can also write

f n+1 = −

Therefore we can state

aT + zcT

1 + c−1z · F +(cid:18) eT

(3.19)

Proposition 3.7. If conditions (3.17)-(3.18) are satisﬁed then (3.19) is a convex combination

of the initial steps and the Maxwellian state.

The above proposition gives the following entropy inequality (see (1.5))

Remark 3. Its is clear that there are few implicit linear multistep methods satisfying conditions
(3.17)-(3.18). More relaxed conditions can be derived for linear multistep methods if we take into
account the starting procedure that generates the vector of f n−j [31]. Here we do not explore further
this direction.

3.2.2. Navier-Stokes asymptotics. A fundamental problem when dealing with AP schemes
for kinetic equations is the behavior of the method in the Navier-Stokes regime. In order to do
this we rewrite the general multistep IMEX scheme of order p as

f n+1 + aT · F

∆t

+ bT · L(F ) =

1
ε

cT · M(M [F ] − F ) +

1
ε

c−1µn+1(M [f n+1] − f n+1),

(3.21)

and consider the discrete Chapman-Enskog expansion taking

f n+1 = M [f n+1] + εgn+1, F = M [F ] + εG,

(3.22)

where hφgn+1i = 0 and hφGi ≡ 0 with G = (gn, . . . , gn−s+1)T .

8

Inserting the above expansions in the numerical method yields

M [f n+1] + aT · M [F ]

∆t

+ bT · L(M [F ])
+ ε(cid:18) gn+1 + aT · G

∆t

+ bT · L(G)(cid:19) = −cT · MG − c−1µn+1gn+1.

(3.23)

Multiplying the above equation by the collision invariants φ(v) and integrating in v gives the
moment system

(3.24)

Consistency of (3.24) with the Navier-Stokes equations is obtained if the vector of initial steps
satisﬁes (see [8, 24]) for j = 0, . . . , s − 1
µ (cid:18) ∂M [f ]

+ L(M [f ])(cid:19) = M [f ](cid:16)A(V )σ(u) + 2B(V ) · ∇x√T(cid:17) + O(ε),

Now we have [24]

(cid:18) ∂M [f ]

where

(|V |2 − 5)V,

with σ(·) deﬁned as in (2.4).
In (3.25) we used the dependence on the Maxwellian M [f ] on
the macroscopic quantities and the Euler system (2.2) to replace the time derivatives with space
derivatives of the moments.

We assume

gn−j = −

1

µn−j M [f n−j](cid:16)A(V n−j)σ(un−j ) + 2B(V n−j) · ∇x√T n−j(cid:17) + O(ε + ∆tq).

(3.27)

Inserting this in (3.24) gives

U n+1 = −

where

bj (cid:0)divxF (U )n−j − ε divxD(∇xU )n−j(cid:1)+O(ε2∆t+ε∆tq+1), (3.28)

D(∇xU )n−j = 


0

νn−jσ(un−j)

κn−j∇xT n−j + νn−s+1σ(un−j) · un−j


 .

We omit the detailed computation of the viscosity νn−j and heat conduction κn−j in terms of the
macroscopic temperature. We refer to [8, 24] for more details. Since the explicit scheme in (3.28)
is an O(∆tp) method for the Navier-Stokes system (2.3), one obtains a consistent discretization of
(2.3) when ε∆tp + ∆tp = o(ε).

9

In order for the scheme to be consistent with the Navier-Stokes limit in time it is crucial that

at the next time step gn+1 satisﬁes a relation analogous to (3.25). From (3.23) we can write

gn+1 = −

1

µn+1 (cid:20) cT

For IMEX-BDF schemes, we have cT ≡ 0, and moreover
c−1 (cid:18) M [f n+1] + aT · M [F ]
+ bT · L(M [F ])(cid:19) = (cid:18) ∂M [f ]

∆t

which as a consequence of (3.25) yields the desired result

gn+1 = −

(3.31)

For more general IMEX linear multistep methods high order accuracy when estimating the
time derivative is lost, and an estimate similar to (3.30) but with ﬁrst order accuracy in time holds
true. Therefore, thanks to the order conditions (3.2), from (3.25) and (3.29) we get

gn+1 = −

1

µn+1 M [f n+1](cid:16)A(V n+1)σ(un+1) + 2B(V n+1) · ∇x√T n+1(cid:17)

ε + µn+1c−1∆t(cid:19) .

(3.32)

We have proved the following:
Theorem 3.8. If the vector of initial steps is well-prepared with respect to the Navier-Stokes
limit as deﬁned in (3.27), then, for small values of ε and with ε∆tq + ∆tp = o(ε), the IMEX
multistep scheme (3.21) becomes the explicit multistep scheme (3.28) for the Navier-Stokes system
(2.3), with q = p for the IMEX-BDF methods and q = 1 for the other IMEX multistep methods.

Remark 4.
• The result shows that the schemes are capable, in principle, to capture the Navier-Stokes
asymptotics without resolving the small scale ε. Note, however, that when ∆t is of order
ε, the error term in (3.31) and (3.32) is an O(1/(1 + µn+1c−1)) term. Therefore, we may
expect loss of accuracy of the schemes in such a regime.

• It is well-known that the limiting Navier-Stokes system for the BGK model diﬀers from the
classical one derived from the full Boltzmann equation since it corresponds to a Prandtl
number P r = 1, whereas the classical one for a monoatomic gas is P r = 2/3. The
correct Prandtl number can be recovered considering a velocity dependent collision frequency
µ = µ(x, v, t) as in the ES-BGK model [8].

• The analysis just performed can be carried on in a similar way also for the full Boltzmann
equation. The conclusions one obtains for the various IMEX multistep schemes are exactly
the same as for the BGK model, therefore the schemes are capable to describe correctly the
Navier-Stokes regime. Here we omit the details. We will, however, discuss the details of
the Navier-Stokes asymptotics for the full Boltzmann equation using a penalized approach
in the next section.

4. Penalized IMEX multistep schemes for the Boltzmann equation. In the case of
the full Boltzmann equation, although the approach just described remains formally valid, a major
diﬃculty concerns the need to solve the system of nonlinear equations originated by the application
of an implicit method to the collision operator QB(f, f ) introduced in (1.2). The computational
cost of such integral operator, characterized by a ﬁve fold nonlinear integral which depends on
the seven dimensional space (x, v, t), is extremely high and makes it extremely expensive the use
of iterative solvers. It is however interesting to remark that for IMEX multistep methods since
a single new evaluation of the collision operator is required at each time step, a single inversion
would be also required which in principle is more feasible then the case of IMEX Runge-Kutta
schemes.

To overcome this diﬃculty, the idea is to reformulate the collision part using a suitable penal-
ization term. This idea, using a BGK model as penalization term, has been introduced recently
in [20]. We refer to [15, 16, 34] for extensions of this approach to high-order IMEX Runge-Kutta
methods and exponential Runge-Kutta methods.

4.1. Asymptotic preserving penalized IMEX linear multistep schemes. Let us now
denote with QP (f ) a general operator which will be used to penalize the original Boltzmann
operator QB(f, f ). The characteristics of QP (f ) are to be computable and invertible at a low
computational cost and that it preserves the local equilibrium, namely QP (f ) = 0 implies f =
M [f ].

We will then rewrite the collision operator in the form

QB(f, f ) = (QB(f, f ) − QP (f )) + QP (f ) = GP (f, f ) + QP (f ),

where by construction hφ GP (f, f )i = 0, and the corresponding kinetic equation reads

∂tf + v · ∇xf =

1
ε

GP (f, f ) +

1
ε

QP (f ).

(4.1)

(4.2)

Now, we consider IMEX multistep schemes in which only the simpler operator QP (f ) is treated im-
plicitly, while the term GP (f, f ) describing the deviations of the true Boltzmann operator QB(f, f )
from the simpliﬁed operator QP (f ) and the convection term ∇xf are treated explicitly.

(4.4)

where GP (F, F ) = (GP (f n, f n), . . . , GP (f n−s+1, f n−s+1))T .

Remark 5. The above penalized approach is equivalent to start from the standard IMEX
multistep scheme (3.3) and to introduce a penalization only on the implicit term. More precisely
we can write (3.3) as

f n+1 = −aT ·F −∆t bT ·L(F )+

(4.6)

(4.7)

are the Lagrange interpolation weights at time n + 1. Using (4.6) in (4.5) we recover (4.4).

We want now to derive conditions for the penalized IMEX multistep schemes to be AP and

asymptotically accurate. We have the following result.

Theorem 4.1.

If the vector of initial steps is well-prepared, in the limit ε → 0, scheme
(4.4) becomes the explicit multistep scheme characterized by (a, b) applied to the limit Euler system
(2.2).

Proof
The proof is similar to that of Theorem 3.3. Let us ﬁrst note that if we multiply the IMEX
multistep scheme (4.4) by the collision invariants φ(v) = 1, v, v2 and integrate the result in velocity
space we obtain the same explicit multistep method (3.7) for the moment system (2.1).

Now we can write equation (4.4) in the form
εf n+1 = −εaT · F + ∆t bT · (GP (F, F ) − εL(F )) + ∆t cT · QP (F ) + ∆t c−1QP (f n+1),

(4.8)

which as ε → 0 yields

(4.9)
Since the initial steps are well-prepared, as ε → 0 we get f n−j = M [f n−j], j = 0, . . . , s − 1 which
implies QP (F ) ≡ 0, GP (F, F ) ≡ 0 and therefore since c−1 6= 0 we have

0 = bT · GP (F, F ) + cT · QP (F ) + c−1QP (f n+1).

QP (f n+1) = 0 ⇒ f n+1 = M [f n+1].

(4.10)

Thus (3.7) becomes the explicit multistep method (3.11) for to the limiting Euler system (2.2).
✷

Note that, for IMEX-BDF schemes in the case of arbitrary initial steps, equation (4.9) reduces

to

0 = bT · GP (F, F ) + c−1QP (f n+1).

(4.11)

Therefore, at variance with the non penalized case, the scheme does not project f n+1 over its local
equilibrium M [f n+1] unless the initial vector is well-prepared so that GP (F, F ) ≡ 0.

4.2. Penalized IMEX relaxation multistep schemes for the Boltzmann equation.
The choice of the optimal penalization operator depends essentially on a balance between accuracy
and computational cost. A popular choice which optimize eﬃciency is given by the simple BGK
relaxation operator [16, 20]. In fact, with this choice, a fundamental property of equations (4.4)
with QP (f ) = µ(M [f ] − f ) is that they can be solved explicitly.

The penalized IMEX multistep method takes the form

+

∆t

ε (cid:0)cT · M(M [F ] − F ) + c−1µn+1(M [f n+1] − f n+1)(cid:1) ,

(4.13)

where the only implicit term is the factor µn+1(M [f n+1] − f n+1) in which M [f n+1] and µn+1
depend only on the moments hφf n+1i. If we now integrate the above equation agains the collision
invariants thanks to the conservations (1.4) we obtain again the moment scheme (3.7). Thus
hφf n+1i, and so M [f n+1] and µn+1, can be explicitly evaluated and system (3.7) is explicitly
solvable.

4.2.1. The space homogeneous case. Next we focus on the monotonicity properties of the
penalized IMEX schemes. As a prototype problem we restrict to the space homogeneous case for
the simpliﬁed BGK model, which in this case however involves the full penalized IMEX method.
As we will see, the presence of the explicit scheme due to the introduction of the penalization lead
to diﬀerent (but still very severe) non negativity conditions.

The penalized IMEX method for QB(f, f ) = η(M [f ] − f ) in the homogeneous case reads

f n+1 = −aT · F +

(4.14)

or equivalently

f n+1 = −(cid:18)λaT + (1 − λ)(cid:18) cT + ξbT

c−1 (cid:19)(cid:19) · F + (1 − λ)(cid:18) cT + ξbT

c−1

· e + 1(cid:19) M [f n].

(4.15)

where ξ = (η − µ)/µ ∈ (−1,∞) is the penalization factor.

Setting z = µ∆t/ε we have λ = 1/(1 + c−1z) and we can state
Proposition 4.2. Suﬃcient conditions to guarantee that f n+1 ≥ 0 when F ≥ 0 in (4.15) are

that

aT + z(cid:0)cT + ξbT(cid:1) ≤ 0,
(cT · e + c−1)(1 + ξ) ≥ 0.

(4.16)

(4.17)

Again conditions (4.16)-(4.17) must be interpreted component by component and for ξ = 0 reduce
to (3.17)-(3.18).
In particular, (4.16) depend on z and originates a time step restriction (and
constraints over the choice of the penalization factor ξ). Note that in (4.17) we used the fact that
bT · e = cT · e + c−1. For penalized IMEX-BDF schemes cT = 0 and conditions (4.16) give

max
0≤j≤s−1{aj/(ξ|bj|), bj < 0} ≤ z ≤ min

0≤j≤s−1{−aj/(ξbj), bj > 0},

ξ > 0.

Note that, for schemes of order higher then 2 the above condition can never be satisﬁed. In the
case of penalized IMEX-Adams methods conditions (4.16) become

z ≤ 1/(c0 + ξb0),

c0 + ξb0 > 0,

max
1≤j≤s−1{cj/|bj|, bj < 0} ≤ ξ ≤ min

1≤j≤s−1{−cj/bj, bj > 0}.

For example, using notations of Table 3.1, nonnegativity time step restrictions of some penal-

ized IMEX multistep schemes are reported in Table 4.1.

(4.18)

Therefore we can state

Proposition 4.3. If conditions (4.16)-(4.17) are satisﬁed then (4.18) is a convex combination

of the initial steps and the Maxwellian state.

From the above proposition we obtain the following entropy bound

4.2.2. Stability restrictions. It is clear that the penalized approach may reduce the stability
region of the full IMEX scheme applied without penalization. This can be observed using the test
equation

y′ = λEy + λI y,

λE, λI ∈ C

(4.20)

where the term λEy is evaluated explicitly and the term λI y implicitly. Typically, for prototype
kinetic equations, we can assume λE pure imaginary and λI real and non positive. In fact, if we
consider a simple transport equation with source like

ft + vfx = −

η
ε

f,

(4.21)

after discretization of the space derivatives, by Fourier transform we recover the test equation
(4.20) with λE the eigenvalues of the advection term and λI those of the stiﬀ source term. We
have λI = −η/ε and, for example using central diﬀerences for (4.21), we get

λE = iv sin(2k)/∆x,

(4.22)

where k is the frequency of the corresponding Fourier mode.

Fig. 4.1. Boundary of the stability region for problem (4.21)-(4.22). Penalized second order (top) and third
order (bottom) IMEX multistep methods with a penalization factor ξ = −0.3, −0.15, 0, 0.15, 0.3. The label on the
contour lines denotes the penalization factor. The thick contour line without label correspond to ξ = 0.

Applying the IMEX multistep method gives the characteristic equation

ρ(ζ) − zEσE(ζ) − zIσI (ζ) = 0,

(4.23)

with zE = λE∆t and zI = λI ∆t and

ρ(ζ) = ζs + aT · X ,

σE(ζ) = bT · X ,

σI (ζ) = c−1ζs + cT · X ,

where X = (ζs−1, ζs−2, . . . , ζ, 1)T . Stability corresponds to the requirement that all roots of (4.23)
have modulus less or equal one and that all multiple roots have modulus less then one. Even if
the prototype equation is very simple and its analysis, in general, cannot be extended to linear
systems (obtained for example trough the methods of lines), for practical purposes it is often used
to obtain informations for stability [1, 2, 30, 31].

For the penalized IMEX approach

y′ = λEy + (λI − λP )y + λP y,

(4.24)

with λP real and non positive, we obtain the same structure of the characteristic equation (4.23)
with the only diﬀerence that now zE = (λE + λI − λP )∆t and zI = λP ∆t. In the case of (4.21)
solved by central diﬀerences, if λP = −µ/ε, by introducing the penalization factor ξ = (η − µ)/µ
we have zE = (iv sin(2k)/∆x − ξµ/ε)∆t and zI = −µ∆t/ε. The stability regions of various

Fig. 4.2. Boundary of the stability region for problem (4.21)-(4.22). Penalized fourth order (top) and ﬁfth
order (bottom) IMEX multistep methods with a penalization factor ξ = −0.3, −0.15, 0, 0.15, 0.3. The label on the
contour lines denotes the penalization factor. The thick contour line without label correspond to ξ = 0.

penalized IMEX multistep schemes are reported in Figures 4.1 and 4.2. The boundaries separate
the stability region (lower part) from the instability region (upper part). Analogous results for
some non penalized IMEX multistep methods and some IMEX Runge-Kutta methods have been
presented in [1, 2, 30]. Its is clear that high order methods are more sensitive to the choice of
the penalization factor and may lead to instabilities unless the eigenvalues of the stiﬀ part are
estimated with enough accuracy. This is particularly true for fourth and ﬁfth order IMEX-BDF
methods.

(4.26)

where, using the same notation of section 3, we have hφgn+1i = 0 and hφGi ≡ 0.

where LM (G) = (LM[f n](gn), . . . ,LM[f n−s+1](gn−s+1))T and

We omit the detailed computation of the viscosity νn−j and heat conduction κn−j in terms of
a(T n−j,|V n−j) and b(T n−j,|V n−j). We refer to [24] for more details. Since the discretization
in (4.33) is an O(∆tp) approximation of the Navier-Stoke system (2.3) we obtains the correct
Navier-Stokes limit if ε∆tq + ∆tp = o(ε).

However, to achieve order p consistency at the next time step, gn+1 should satisfy the analogous

of (4.30). From (4.27) we have

For more general IMEX multistep methods, high order accuracy in the evaluation of the time
derivatives is lost and we obtain the same estimate (4.35) but with ﬁrst order accuracy in time.
This shows that the penalized IMEX multistep schemes are able to capture correctly the Navier-
Stokes asymptotics.

We can state the following:
Theorem 4.4. If the vector of initial steps is well-prepared with respect to the Navier-Stokes
limit as deﬁned in (4.30), then, for small values of ε and with ε∆tq + ∆tp = o(ε), the penalized
IMEX relaxation multistep scheme (4.25) becomes the explicit multistep scheme (4.33) for the
Navier-Stokes system (2.3), with q = p for the IMEX-BDF methods and q = 1 for the other IMEX
multistep methods.

Remark 6.
• Again, even if the schemes are capable to capture the Navier-Stokes asymptotics without
resolving the small scale ε we may observe loss of accuracy of the schemes when ∆t is of
order ε,since the error term becomes an O(1/(1 + µn+1c−1)) term.

• The same kind of analysis holds true also for more general penalization operators QP (f )
and the conclusions one obtains for the various penalized IMEX multistep schemes are the
same as in the case of the BGK penalization.

5. Numerical examples. Scope of this section is to perform several numerical tests for the
IMEX multistep schemes in order to highlight their behaviors in various regimes of the stiﬀness
parameter ε. We will consider both the BGK and the Boltzmann case. In the case of the full
Boltzmann equation the penalized IMEX multistep schemes have been applied using the BGK
relaxation operator as penalization term. We start our numerical results with the space non
homogeneous BGK equation, next we pass to the space homogeneous Boltzmann equation and
we conclude with the full non homogeneous Boltzmann equation. In all tests we have considered
eight diﬀerent IMEX multistep schemes from order two up to order ﬁve. More precisely, we report
results for the IMEX-BDF schemes of order two, three, four and ﬁve, for the second order IMEX-
SG scheme, and for the IMEX-TVB schemes of order three, four and ﬁve. The coeﬃcients of the
schemes are given in Table 3.1.

5.1. Non homogeneous BGK equation. We numerically measure the accuracy of the
IMEX multistep methods in solving equation (1.1) with the BGK collision operator (1.8) on a
periodic smooth solution. The computation is performed on (x, v) ∈ [0, 1] × [−vmax, vmax], with
vmax = 8. We take Nv = 512 grid points in the velocity space. A 5th order WENO scheme for the
space discretization [38] has been used. The largest time step is ﬁxed equal to ∆tmax = ∆x
for
4vmax
all simulations, which is suﬃcient to guarantee stability. The initial data is

̺0(x) =

2 + sin(8πx)

3

, u0(x) = 0, T0(x) =

2 + cos(8πx)

3

,

(5.1)

where an initial distribution, f (x, v, t = 0) = f0 = M [f0] + εg with g a perturbation from equilib-
rium consistent with the Navier-Stokes limit has been used as in (3.25). We report the convergence
rates with respect to the time step ∆t measured by computing the L1 norm of the error for the
density for diﬀerent values of the Knudsen number, i.e. ε = 10−1, ε = 10−2 and ε = 10−5. In order
to perform such a measure of the convergence rate we repeat the computation for a decreasing time
step ∆t1 = ∆tmax/2, ∆t2 = ∆tmax/4 and ∆t3 = ∆tmax/8 while the grid points in space is ﬁxed
to Nx = 128. Finally, in order to initialize the diﬀerent multistep schemes a third order IMEX
Runge-Kutta scheme [16] has been employed with very small time steps to produce the vector of
initial data accurate up to machine precision.

Figure 5.1 shows the results for all the multistep schemes tested. The second order schemes
are depicted on the top left of the ﬁgure, the third order schemes on the top right, the fourth order
schemes are reported on the bottom left while the ﬁfth order schemes are shown on the bottom
right side. All schemes tested exhibit the theoretical rate of convergence for the diﬀerent values
of ε. We point out that in our numerical simulation we have observed that fourth and ﬁfth order
schemes are more sensitive to the correct initialization of the initial vector in agreement with the
Navier-Stokes system, otherwise loss of accuracy has been observed.

5.2. Homogeneous Boltzmann equation. This test has been performed to study the ac-
curacy of the penalized IMEX multistep schemes based on the BGK operator in the case of the
space homogeneous Boltzmann equation

∂tf =

ε

Q(f, f ),

(5.2)

with Q(f, f ) given by (1.2) in the two dimensional velocity space. The collision kernel corresponds
to Maxwellian molecules B(|v − v∗|, n) = 4π and the fast spectral method [35] has been used to
approximate the collision operator with Nv = 64 grid points in each velocity direction and a grid
[−vmax, vmax]2 with vmax = 10.
As discussed in Section 4.2.2 the choice of the penalization factor plays a major rule in the
case of high order methods. Here we assume a constant µ = ρ so that the loss part of the collision

Q(f, f ) − µ(M − f ) = Q+(f, f ) − ρf − µ(M − f ) = Q+(f, f ) − µM,

(cid:19)(cid:19) ,

where we took ρ0 = 1, ux = 1, uy = 1 and T0 = 1. We report the results in term of the L1 error
for the distribution function f , i.e. kf − fexk1, for the penalized IMEX-BDF schemes in Figure
5.2. Analogous results are obtained using the other IMEX multistep schemes of the same order.
The reference solution has been computed by using a third order penalized Runge-Kutta method
[16] using very small time steps up to machine error. The same third order penalized IMEX
Runge-Kutta scheme has been employed also to produce the initial vector needed for starting the
multistep schemes. The same strategy has also been adopted: the time step has been reduced up
to the machine error for producing numerically exact initial values. The theoretical convergence
rate have been observed for all the schemes considered for this test in all regimes.
In Figure
5.2) we report the error curves for diﬀerent values of the time step for the penalized IMEX-BDF
methods. Essentially the same error curves are obtained with the other IMEX multistep schemes
of corresponding order. Note that in this case we have only one time scale t/ε and therefore we
ﬁxed ε = 1 and consider diﬀerent values of the time step. A similar test case was considered in
[17] for penalized IMEX Runge-Kutta methods.

5.3. Non homogeneous Boltzmann equation. The last test case considers the numerical
solution of the full non homogeneous Boltzmann equation (1.1)-(1.2) in one space dimension and in
the two dimensional velocity space. The same penalized setting of the homogeneous test has been
used, namely Maxwell molecules as a collision kernel and BGK model as penalization operator
with µ(x, t) = ρ(x, t).

The computation is performed on (x, v) ∈ [0, 1]× [−vmax, vmax]2, with vmax = 8 and Nv = 256.
A 5-th order WENO scheme has been used for the space discretization with the largest time step
equal to ∆tmax = ∆x

As in the case of the space non homogeneous BGK model an initial distribution f (x, v, t = 0) =
f0 = M [f0] + εg with g a perturbation from equilibrium consistent with the Navier-Stokes limit
has been used. We report the convergence rates for the multistep schemes obtained by measuring
the L1 norm of the error for the density for diﬀerent values of the Knudsen number, i.e. ε = 10−1,
ε = 10−2 and ε = 10−5 and diﬀerent time steps. The rates, as before, have been obtained
repeating the computation with the same initial data for a decreasing time step ∆t1 = ∆tmax/2,
∆t2 = ∆tmax/4 and ∆t3 = ∆tmax/8 while the grid points in space remain ﬁxed to Nx = 128. The
penalized multistep schemes are initialized by a penalized third order IMEX Runge-Kutta scheme
reaching the machine precision. Figure 5.3 show the convergence rates for various penalized IMEX
multistep schemes from order two up to order ﬁve. The schemes tested exhibit the theoretical
convergence rate, except for the ﬁfth order schemes where degradation of accuracy is observed

for small values of ε. This is particularly evident for IMEX-BDF5 scheme and it is due to the
fact that very high order penalized IMEX multistep schemes are extremely sensitive to the choice
of the penalization factor, as analyzed in Section 4.2.2. Therefore, one should consider a better
penalization strategy, for example based on a velocity dependent frequency BGK model. An
interesting alternative in this case is represented by the ES-BGK model [8]. Here, however, we do
not explore further this direction.

6. Final considerations. IMEX multistep schemes represent an interesting alternative to
IMEX Runge-Kutta and exponential methods, in particular when one deals with multidimensional
kinetic equations with stiﬀ collision terms. Thanks to their simpler structure, it is possible to
achieve high order accuracy without additional coupling conditions and at a reduced computational
cost. This is of paramount importance in the numerical solution of kinetic equations, where
the computational cost due to the multidimensionality of the problem and the structure of the
Boltzmann collision term is often the major concern in the construction of the numerical method.
In this paper we have analyzed and studied such schemes in the case of general collisional kinetic
equations, by considering a penalized strategy to avoid the costly inversion of the collision term
in the case of the full Boltzmann equation. Both, the theoretical results and the numerical tests
have shown that the schemes are able to work with uniform accuracy for a wide range of the
relaxation parameter ε including the Navier-Stokes regime. On the other hand the schemes are
more sensitive to the choice of the penalization factor and instabilities may be observed with high
order penalized methods. Further research directions will consider the possibility to use high order

22

schemes without penalization by a suitable inversion of the single collision term needed at each
time step and the use of velocity dependent frequencies in the BGK model used for penalization,
like the ES-BGK model.
