IRREDUCIBLE ADMISSIBLE MOD-p REPRESENTATIONS OF METAPLECTIC

GROUPS

KAROL KOZIO L AND LAURA PESKIN

Abstract. Let p be an odd prime number, and F a nonarchimedean local ﬁeld of residual characteristic p.
We classify the smooth, irreducible, admissible genuine mod-p representations of the twofold metaplectic cover
fSp2n(F ) of Sp2n(F ) in terms of genuine supercuspidal (equivalently, supersingular) representations of Levi
subgroups. To do so, we use results of Henniart–Vign´eras as well as new technical results to adapt Herzig’s
method to the metaplectic setting. As consequences, we obtain an irreducibility criterion for principal series
representations generalizing the complete irreducibility of principal series representations in the rank 1 case,
as well as the fact that irreducibility is preserved by parabolic induction from the cover of the Siegel Levi
subgroup.

1. Introduction

1.1. Context. Let p be an odd prime number, and F a nonarchimedean local ﬁeld of residual characteristic
p. The irreducible admissible mod-p representations of a connected reductive group over F have recently been
classiﬁed up to supercuspidals by Abe–Henniart–Herzig–Vign´eras [1], completing a line of research begun
by Barthel–Livn´e in the 1990s ([3], [4]). Their classiﬁcation is part of an ongoing eﬀort to formulate a
mod-p local Langlands correspondence, which aims to generalize the existing correspondence, due to Breuil
[6], between certain two-dimensional mod-p representations of Gal(Qp/Qp) and certain admissible mod-p
representations of GL2(Qp). It is expected that such a correspondence would be compatible with a p-adic local
Langlands correspondence; this is the case for GL2(Qp), where the p-adic correspondence is due to Colmez,
Kisin, Paˇsk¯unas, and others (see [8], [17], [24]; see also [9] for a recent treatment, and [5] for an overview).
Furthermore, it is expected that a mod-p local Langlands correspondence would reﬂect information about
mod-p automorphic forms via generalizations of Serre’s conjectures.

In the setting of C-representations, recent advances have raised the possibility of incorporating covers of
reductive algebraic groups into the local Langlands correspondences. So far, the results are most complete in
the case of the metaplectic double cover of Sp2n(F ). In this case, Gan–Savin [10] produced a correspondence
between C-representations of the metaplectic double cover of Sp2n(F ) and certain Weil-Deligne representations
by composing the theta correspondence (properties of which were established in the necessary generality in
loc. cit.) with the local Langlands correspondence for odd special orthogonal groups. More recently, work
of Weissman ([31], [32]), Gan–Gao [11], and others has laid groundwork for conjectural local Langlands
correspondences of C-representations for a general class of covering groups.
In particular, Weissman has
constructed a candidate for the L-group of a Brylinski–Deligne cover of a quasisplit algebraic group, whose
specialization to Gan–Savin’s setting explains some surprising features of the local Langlands correspondence
for the metaplectic cover of Sp2n(F ) (see [11] §12).

As the two aforementioned programs develop, it is natural to ask what role the modular representations of
covering groups might play. In the mod-ℓ setting, for ℓ suﬃciently large, M´ınguez [21] has shown the existence
of a bijective theta correspondence for type II dual reductive pairs over a nonarchimedean local ﬁeld of residual
characteristic p 6= ℓ; he also found that the analogous map can fail to be bijective for certain small values of ℓ.
In the mod-p setting, Shin [28] notes that several key ingredients of the classical theta correspondence are no
longer available at all, and he proposes new geometric constructions to take their place in a hypothetical mod-p
theta correspondence. In particular, he constructs algebraic Weil representations of metaplectic group schemes
which agree with the classical objects upon taking C-coeﬃcients, but whose specializations to Fp-coeﬃcients
depend on the input of a p-divisible group and are not, in general, representations of the metaplectic double
cover of Sp2n(F ) considered here. Computations using Shin’s constructions [27] raise intriguing questions,
and probably require more data (particularly for type I dual reductive pairs) to interpret.

We aim to provide some initial information regarding the mod-p representation theory of metaplectic groups
over local ﬁelds, in the hope that this will help shape hypothetical mod-p versions of the above correspondences.

1.2. Main results. Our main result is a classiﬁcation of the smooth, irreducible, admissible, genuine mod-p
representations of the metaplectic double cover of Sp2n(F ) in terms of supercuspidal representations (from
now on, “representation” will always mean “smooth Fp-representation”). This generalizes a classiﬁcation by
the second-named author [25] for the metaplectic double cover of SL2(F ). We will denote Sp2n(F ) by G

parabolic subgroup of G (that is, a parabolic subgroup containing B), σ is a genuine supersingular represen-

We closely follow the existing classiﬁcations of irreducible admissible representations of p-adic reductive
groups ([2] in the split case, [1] in general) which build on the techniques introduced by Herzig in [14]. In

and its metaplectic cover by eG, and we refer the reader to §2.2 for a construction of eG. Here we note only
that there is an open, continuous map pr : eG −→ G with kernel isomorphic to {±1}, and that a genuine
representation of eG is one which does not factor through pr. We also ﬁx a maximal torus T in G, and a Borel
subgroup B containing T . Given any closed subgroup H of G, we let eH denote the subgroup pr
−1(H) of eG.
particular, our classiﬁcation is expressed in terms of supersingular triples (eP −, σ, eQ−). Here P is a standard
tation (we will discuss this term presently) of the Levi factor of eP , and eQ− is the preimage in eG of a standard
parabolic subgroup of G satisfying some conditions with respect to eP − and σ.
Given a supersingular triple (eP −, σ, eQ−), we deﬁne a certain parabolically induced genuine eG-representation,
denoted by I(eP −, σ, eQ−). After deﬁning two supersingular triples (eP −, σ, eQ−), (eP ′−, σ′, eQ′−) to be equivalent
if eP − = eP ′−, eQ− = eQ′−, and σ ∼= σ′, we obtain the following classiﬁcation as our main result:
Theorem (Theorem 4.13). The map (eP −, σ, eQ−) 7−→ I(eP −, σ, eQ−) gives a bijection between equivalence
eG.

classes of supersingular triples and isomorphism classes of irreducible admissible genuine representations of

We now discuss the ingredients needed to state the classiﬁcation more precisely.

1. Supersingular representations. We refer the reader to Deﬁnition 4.4 for the precise deﬁnition of supersingu-
larity in our context. The notion of a supersingular representation was introduced by Barthel–Livn´e ([4], [3])
in the case of GL2(F ), and a generalized deﬁnition for split reductive groups was made by Herzig ([14] §1.2.1)
using the mod-p Satake transform of [15]. The central piece of the deﬁnition is a condition on the systems of
eigenvalues which occur in weight spaces of a representation under the action of the associated spherical Hecke
algebras: no such system of eigenvalues may factor through a Satake transform to a spherical Hecke algebra of
any proper Levi subgroup. Herzig also requires supersingular representations to be irreducible and admissible
(admissibility was not required by [4], [3]), and shows that supersingularity is equivalent to supercuspidality
for this class of representations. We essentially adopt Herzig’s deﬁnition (adding a genuineness condition),
using results of Henniart–Vign´eras [13] which guarantee that Herzig’s mod-p Satake transform adapts well to
the metaplectic case. For the appropriate deﬁnition of supercuspidality in our case, supersingularity is again
equivalent to supercuspidality (see below).

2. Generalized Steinberg representations. Let P ⊂ Q be two standard parabolic subgroups of G, and let
P − ⊂ Q− denote the respective opposite parabolics. The generalized Steinberg representation associated to
the pair (P −, Q−) is deﬁned to be

where the sum runs over standard parabolic subgroups Q′ such that P − ( Q′− ⊂ Q−, and where 1 denotes
the trivial representation of each group Q′ in turn. Each StQ−
P − is an irreducible admissible representation of
Q− (see [19], Th´eor`eme 3.1, and note that the unipotent radical of Q− acts trivially). In the following, we
will let StQ−

P − denote the representation of eQ− obtained by inﬂating the generalized Steinberg representation
of Q− (note that this inﬂation is not a genuine representation of eQ−).

4. eG-representation associated to a supersingular triple. Let (eP −, σ, eQ−) be a supersingular triple, let eP (σ)
denote the parabolic subgroup of eG mentioned in the previous point, and inﬂate eσ from fM (σ) to eP (σ)−.
Following [1], we show in Proposition 4.9 that I(eP −, σ, eQ−) is irreducible, admissible, and genuine whenever
(eP −, σ, eQ−) is a supersingular triple.
sible genuine representation π of eG is supercuspidal if π is not isomorphic to a subquotient of the parabolic
induction of an irreducible admissible genuine representation of a proper Levi subgroup of eG. We then have:

Next, let PS denote the (standard) Siegel parabolic subgroup, and MS ∼= GLn(F ) its standard Levi factor.
The classiﬁcation theorem above, together with the analogous result in the reductive case, implies that

In addition to the above, we also obtain the following information about the genuine principal series

eB−(σ) is irreducible if and only if, for every short root α ∈ Π, there exists

Consequently, whenever a proof requires only minor cosmetic changes from the analogous proof in the reductive
case, we often simply give a reference to the literature. For the sake of completeness, however, we have
attempted to give a more detailed account of the classiﬁcation proof (§4).

The work of Henniart–Vign´eras in [13] and [12] establishes many of the technical ingredients of Herzig’s

denotes an Fp-character of H eG(eV ) (viewed also as a character of H eG(eV ′) via a natural identiﬁcation of the two

algebras). We ﬁnd a criterion (Theorem 3.1) for the existence of such an isomorphism which is strictly weaker
than the analogous criterion for G. (See [2], Theorem 4.1 for the change-of-weight criterion applicable to G.)
This weakening of the change-of-weight criterion is responsible for the relative weakness of the irreducibility
criteria of Corollary 4.17 and Corollary 4.18, as compared to the criteria for representations of G.

The proof of our change-of-weight criterion is given in §3, and involves computing the Satake transform of
a certain Hecke operator. In §4, after adapting the notion of supersingularity to our context and modifying
the change-of-weight criterion as per the result of §3, we continue with the classiﬁcation as in the reductive case.

2. Notation and Preliminary Results

Let p be an odd prime and F a nonarchimedean local ﬁeld of residual characteristic p. We let O denote the
ring of integers of F , ̟ ∈ O a ﬁxed uniformizer, and k the residue ﬁeld O/̟O. We ﬁx an algebraic closure
k of k, and denote the order of k by q. Furthermore, we let µ2 := µ2(F ) = {±1} denote the group of square
roots of unity in F , and let

denote the quadratic Hilbert symbol.

(−, −)F : F × × F × −→ µ2

2.1. Symplectic groups. Fix an integer n ≥ 1 and let G := Sp2n, deﬁned and split over F . We will abuse
notation and write G for G(F ), the group of F -points. We ﬁx a split maximal torus T , and we choose a
hyperspecial point in the corresponding apartment of the Bruhat–Tits building of G. Such a point gives
a connected reductive integral model of G over O, and we continue to denote this model by G. We set
K := G(O), which is a hyperspecial maximal compact subgroup. The ﬁnite group of k-points of G will be
denoted G(k).

It will be convenient to work with coordinates on G, as follows. Let W be the 2n-dimensional vector space

over F spanned by {e1, . . . , en, e∗
i , e∗

(ei, ej)W = (e∗

n}, with symplectic form (−, −)W deﬁned by

1, . . . , e∗
j )W = 0 for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n, and (ei, e∗

j )W = −(e∗

j , ei)W = δi,j.

We view G as the subgroup of SL(W ) preserving (−, −)W . The group K is realized as the subgroup of SL(W )
preserving (−, −)W and the O-lattice spanned by {e1, . . . , en, e∗

n}. In terms of matrices, we have

(cid:19) g =(cid:18)

(cid:19)(cid:27)

where 1n denotes the n × n identity matrix, and K = G ∩ SL2n(O).

The group T is the maximal torus of G which is diagonal with respect to the basis {e1, . . . , en, e∗

n};
when t ∈ T and 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we write ti for the element of F × such that t·ei = tiei. We let X ∗(T ) (respectively,
X∗(T )) denote the group of algebraic characters (resp., cocharacters) of T (or, more precisely, of the algebraic
group deﬁning T ). A Z-basis for X ∗(T ) is given by

1, . . . , e∗

where χi(t) = ti. A Z-basis for X∗(T ) is given by

denote the perfect pairing deﬁned by χ(λ(x)) = xhχ,λi, for χ ∈ X ∗(T ) and λ ∈ X∗(T ). As in [2], for two
subsets A ⊂ X ∗(T ) and A′ ⊂ X∗(T ), we use the notation hA, A′i = 0 to mean that hχ, λi = 0 for every
χ ∈ A, λ ∈ A′, with h∅, A′i = 0 and hA, ∅i = 0 holding automatically. Likewise, we say hA, A′i 6= 0 if there
exist χ ∈ A, λ ∈ A′ such that hχ, λi 6= 0. We also write hχ, A′i = 0 in place of h{χ}, A′i = 0 (and similarly for
the second factor).

Let Φ denote the root system of G with respect to T and ﬁx

Π := {αi : 1 ≤ i ≤ n}

as the set of simple roots, where

αi := χi − χi+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and αn := 2χn.

For a simple root αi, let α∨
j ≤ n}, we have

i ∈ X∗(T ) denote the corresponding coroot; in terms of the cocharacters {λj : 1 ≤

α∨
i = λi − λi+1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and α∨

n = λn.

The simple roots deﬁne a partition Φ = Φ+ ⊔ Φ−, and a partial order ≤ on X∗(T ): we say λ ≤ µ if
i , where ai ∈ Z≥0. Moreover, the set Π also deﬁnes the monoid X∗(T )− of antidominant

i=1 aiα∨

µ − λ =Pn

cocharacters, given by

X∗(T )− := {λ ∈ X∗(T ) : hα, λi ≤ 0 for all α ∈ Π}.

For α ∈ Φ, we let Uα denote the root subgroup associated to α, and let uα : F ∼−→ Uα denote a ﬁxed
root morphism satisfying the properties of Lemma 8.1.4 of [29]. It satisﬁes tuα(x)t−1 = uα(α(t)x) for t ∈ T ,
x ∈ F .

Let B denote the Borel subgroup of G with respect to Π, and let U denote the unipotent radical of B. Thus
B is generated by T and Uα for α ∈ Φ+. We let B− = T ⋉ U − denote the opposite Borel subgroup. More
generally, the notation P = M ⋉ N will be used to denote parabolic subgroups of G, while P − = M ⋉ N −
denotes the opposite parabolic. We say P = M ⋉ N is a standard parabolic subgroup if P is a parabolic
subgroup containing B, N is its unipotent radical contained in U , and M is a Levi subgroup containing T .
Moreover, we say a subgroup of G is a standard Levi subgroup if it is the Levi factor of a standard parabolic
subgroup.

Standard parabolic subgroups correspond bijectively to subsets of Π, and for a subset J ⊂ Π, we let
PJ = MJ ⋉ NJ denote the corresponding standard parabolic subgroup. Reciprocally, for a standard parabolic
subgroup P = M ⋉ N , we will denote by ΠM the corresponding subset of Π. For λ ∈ X∗(T ), we will write
Pλ = Mλ ⋉ Nλ for standard parabolic corresponding to the subset of α ∈ Π such that hα, λi = 0; see [29],
§13.4.2 and 15.4.4. We deﬁne the Siegel parabolic subgroup PS = MS ⋉ NS as the parabolic corresponding to
the subset {α1, . . . , αn−1}. The group PS is the stabilizer of the Lagrangian subpace spanned by {e1, . . . , en}.
Moreover, we have MS ∼= GLn(F ), and NS ∼= Symn×n(F ), the additive group of symmetric n-by-n matrices.
We will also need to consider the symplectic similitude group, so we set notation for it here. Let GSp2n(F )

be the subgroup of GL(W ) preserving (−, −)W up to a nonzero scalar. In terms of matrices, we have

GSp2n(F ) =(cid:26)g ∈ GL2n(F ) : g⊤(cid:18)

−1n

(cid:19) for some z ∈ F ×(cid:27) .

The torus T of G is contained in the diagonal maximal torus of GSp2n(F ), and we let λn+1 denote the
cocharacter of the larger torus deﬁned by λn+1(x) · ej = xej and λn+1(x) · e∗
j for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. The set
{λi : 1 ≤ i ≤ n + 1} then gives a Z-basis for the cocharacter group of the maximal torus of GSp2n(F ), and
we have GSp2n(F ) ∼= Sp2n(F ) ⋊ λn+1(F ×).

j = e∗

2.2. Covering groups. We now discuss covers of Sp2n(F ) and GSp2n(F ). Our main reference is [11] (espe-
cially §16.1 and §16.3), which in turn is based on [7].

The general framework of [7] shows how to construct central extensions of the form

1 −→ K2 −→ GSp2n −→ GSp2n −→ 1

as sheaves of groups on the big Zariski site of Spec(F ), where K2 is the sheaf of groups associated to K2 in
Quillen’s K-theory. By Theorem 6.2 of loc. cit. (see also §2.5 of [11]), the category of such extensions is
equivalent to a category whose objects are triples (Q, E, f ), where

Q :

Zλi −→ Z

n+1Mi=1

is a quadratic form invariant under the Weyl group of GSp2n, E is a certain group extension, and f is a
certain isomorphism. The precise deﬁnitions of E and f are not relevant for our purposes, but let us only
mention that for every choice of Q as above, there exist E and f for which the triple (Q, E, f ) satisﬁes the
necessary coherence properties (cf. [11], §2.6).

Note in particular that Q(α∨
n ) = 1. We ﬁx choices of E and f for which the
triple (Q, E, f ) satisﬁes the relevant coherence conditions, and we let GSp2n denote the associated extension
of GSp2n by K2. Since H1(F, K2) = 0, upon taking F -points we obtain

i ) = 2 if 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 and Q(α∨

and we deﬁne the topological group gGSp2n(F ) by pushing out the above exact sequence by the quadratic
1 −→ µ2 −→ gGSp2n(F ) −→ GSp2n(F ) −→ 1.
We shall need a more explicit description of the maximal torus of gGSp2n(F ). Fix two cocharacters λ, λ′
of the torus of GSp2n(F ), and let x, y ∈ F ×. Letting eλ(x) and eλ′(y) denote arbitrary lifts of λ(x), λ′(y) to
gGSp2n(F ), we obtain the following commutator formula (cf. [11], §3.3):
heλ(x),eλ′(y)i = (x, y)Q(λ+λ′)−Q(λ)−Q(λ′)
In particular, if λ =Pn
while if λ =Pn
Finally, we deﬁne eG =fSp2n(F ) to be the pullback to G of the cover gGSp2n(F ) −→ GSp2n(F ):

Here, pr : eG −→ G denotes the projection map, which is continuous and open. We will identify µ2 with its
image in eG via the injection above.
The group eG is isomorphic to the classical metaplectic double cover constructed by Weil (see §16 of [11],
§4.3 of [31], or Proposition 4.15 of [7]). When necessary, we will work with coordinates on eG as follows: as a
set, we identify eG with G × µ2, with product given by (g, ζ) · (g′, ζ′) = (gg′, σ(g, g′)ζζ′). Here, σ denotes Rao’s

cocycle (cf. [26]), whose image in H2(G, µ2) ∼= µ2 gives the nontrivial class. In particular, if m, m′ ∈ MS, we
have

G if and only if eg and eg′ commute in eG. Note that this is not true for GSp2n(F ) and its double cover (cf.

over N . Likewise, §4.4 of loc. cit. shows that the extension also splits uniquely over the maximal compact
subgroup K. (Our assumption that p 6= 2 is necessary here.) We remark that one may prove these results
in a much more “hands-on” way by computing H1(−, µ2) and H2(−, µ2) (and utilizing §11 of [23]). Similar
cohomological arguments show that the extension splits uniquely over N ∩ K, and therefore the splittings
over N and K must agree on N ∩ K.

will write H ∗ for the image of H under its unique splitting, which gives eH ∼= H ∗ × µ2. In particular, the
factorization P = M ⋉ N of a standard parabolic subgroup lifts to eP = fM ⋉ N ∗, and we refer to eP as a
standard parabolic subgroup of eG.
Let α ∈ Φ. Since the cover eG −→ G splits uniquely over Uα, we may compose the root morphism uα with

eα∨(x) :=euα(x)eu−α(−x−1)euα(x − 1)eu−α(1)euα(−1).

α ⊂ eUα.
Note that eα∨(x) ∈ eT is a preimage of α∨(x) ∈ T .
Since the group G is simply connected, we have X∗(T ) = Ln

eλ(̟) :=
The elementeλ(̟) ∈ eT is a preimage of λ(̟) ∈ T . Moreover, since eT is commutative (cf. equation (3)), the
map λ 7−→eλ(̟) is an injective homomorphism which induces an isomorphism X∗(T ) ∼−→ eT /(eT ∩ eK).
Let H be any closed subgroup of G or of eG, and V a representation of H. The representation V is called

smooth if for every vector v ∈ V the stabilizer of v is an open subgroup of H. All representations appearing
will be assumed to be smooth. We denote by V H (resp., VH ) the subspace of invariants (resp., coinvariants)
under the action of H. We say V is admissible if V J is ﬁnite dimensional over Fp for every open subgroup J
of H. Finally, let ε : µ2 −→ F×
p denote the nontrivial character of µ2. If H is any closed subgroup of G and

eH its preimage in eG, then a representation V of eH is called genuine if ζ · v = ε(ζ)v for all ζ ∈ µ2.
A weight of eK is a genuine irreducible representation of eK. Since the extension splits over K, every weight
of eK is of the form eV = V ⊠ ε where V is a weight of K (i.e., an irreducible representation of K) viewed as a

representation of K ∗ via the canonical splitting over K.

Let Xq(T ) denote the set of q-restricted weights of T , i.e.,

and also deﬁne

Xq(T ) := {χ ∈ X ∗(T ) : 0 ≤ hχ, α∨i < q for all α ∈ Π},

X 0(T ) := {χ ∈ X ∗(T ) : hχ, α∨i = 0 for all α ∈ Π}.

Given a character ν ∈ X ∗(T ) which satisﬁes hν, α∨i ≥ 0 for all α ∈ Π, we let F (ν) denote the associated

q (T ), X 0

Finally, for ν ∈ Xq(T ), we set

algebraic representation of G(k) of highest weight ν. By Proposition 2.2 of [14], every weight of eK is equal to
eF (ν) := F (ν) ⊠ ε for some ν ∈ Xq(T ), where we view F (ν) as a representation of K via K −։ G(k) ֒−→ G(k).
Moreover, eF (ν) ∼= eF (ν′) if and only if ν − ν′ ∈ (q − 1)X 0(T ). If M is a standard Levi subgroup of G, then
we will refer to genuine irreducible representations of fM ∩ eK as weights of fM ∩ eK, or just weights of fM . We
denote the analogs of Xq(T ), X 0(T ), and eF (ν) by X M
and given a standard Levi subgroup fM , we say eV = eF (ν) is fM -regular if Πν ⊂ ΠM .

U and K. By uniqueness of the splittings over U and K, this implies that eλn+1(y) normalizes U ∗ and K ∗,
whereeλn+1(y) denotes an arbitrary lift of λn+1(y) to gGSp2n(F ). Suppose eSµ,λ,ζ 6= ∅, and choose u ∈ eSµ,λ,ζ.

This showseλn+1(y)ueλn+1(y)−1 ∈ eSµ,λ,ζ(̟,y)F . In particular, taking y to be an element whose image in k× is
not a square gives an injective map from eSλ,µ,ζ to eSλ,µ,−ζ . Combining with part (1) gives the claim.

diagm×m(1 + ̟, . . . , 1 + ̟), and let n denote a representative of the invariant coset, with projection(cid:0) 1m

where C ∈ Symm×m(F ). Then the condition that the coset (N −
1 ∩K)n is ﬁxed under conjugation is equivalent
to A⊤CA − C ∈ Symm×m(O). Letting C = (cij )i,j , we obtain ((1 + ̟)2 − 1)cij ∈ O for each 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m.
Since char(k) 6= 2, the coeﬃcient ((1+̟)2 −1) belongs to ̟Or̟2O, hence cij ∈ ̟−1O for each 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m.
Now ﬁx 1 ≤ r < s ≤ m, and let A = (aij)i,j ∈ GLm(O) denote the matrix such that aij = 1 if i = j or if
(i, j) = (r, s), and aij = 0 otherwise. Then (A⊤CA−C)is = cir for each i 6= s, while (A⊤CA−C)ss = crr+2csr,
so the rth row and column of C must each belong to Om. Varying r, s, we see that cij ∈ O for all (i, j) 6= (m, m).

nonnegative (cf. [16], §13, Table 1, or [18]), we see that all entries of ~b = C−1~c are nonpositive. On the other
hand, ~b ∈ A, which implies ~b = ~0. We have mhαi, α∨

i i ≤ 2 if and only if m ≤ 1, so this gives A6=i

~a = {~0, ~εi}.

We may therefore assume 1 ≤ ci ≤ 2. The ith entry of C(~b + m~εi) is ci + hαi, α∨

~b + m~εi ∈ A, we have ci + 2m ≤ 2, which implies m = 0. Therefore, A6=i

Remark 4.5. One can similarly deﬁne supersingularity with respect to (eK ′ ∩fM ,eT , eB ∩fM ), where eK ′ is a
maximal compact subgroup of eG deﬁned by another hyperspecial point in the apartment corresponding to T .
We will show that the notion of supersingularity is independent of such a choice of maximal compact eK ′; see
Lemma 4.16. In the meantime, we will often abbreviate “supersingular with respect to (eK ∩fM ,eT , eB ∩fM )”
As in [2], we begin with a standard parabolic subgroup eP = fM ⋉ N ∗, and a genuine irreducible admissible
supersingular representation σ of fM . We deﬁne

Lemma 4.16. A representation π of eG is supersingular with respect to (eK,eT , eB) if and only if π is supersin-
gular with respect to (eK ′,eT ′, eB′) as above. If eK ′ is a conjugate of eK by an element of the diagonal maximal
torus of gGSp2n(F ), then a representation σ of a standard Levi subgroup fM of eG is supersingular with respect
to (eK ∩fM ,eT , eB ∩fM ) if and only if it is supersingular with respect to (eK ′ ∩fM ,eT , eB ∩fM ). Thus the results
of Theorem 4.13 do not depend on the choice of such eK ′.

Proof. It only remains to prove the second part. We may decompose σ as

σ ∼= (σ1 ⊗ χψ) ⊠ σ2,

as in Corollary 4.15; the result then follows by applying the ﬁrst part of the lemma to σ2, and applying the
analogous result in the reductive case (cf. [2], Corollary 5.13) to σ1.

Levi factor M , a supersingular representation ρ of M , and a parabolic subgroup Q with P ⊂ Q ⊂ P (ρ)S such
