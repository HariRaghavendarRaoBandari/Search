ON THE COHOMOLOGY RING OF NARROW LAGRANGIAN

3-MANIFOLDS, QUANTUM REIDEMEISTER TORSION, AND THE

LANDAU-GINZBURG SUPERPOTENTIAL

FRANC¸ OIS CHARETTE

Abstract. Let L be a closed, orientable, monotone Lagrangian 3-manifold of a symplectic
manifold (M, ω), for which there exists a local system such that the corresponding La-
grangian quantum homology vanishes. We show that its cohomology ring satisﬁes a certain
dichotomy, which depends only on the parity of the ﬁrst Betti number of L. Essentially, the
triple cup product on the ﬁrst cohomology group is shown to be either of maximal rank or
identically zero. This in turn inﬂuences the Landau-Ginzburg superpotential of L: either
one of its partial derivatives do not vanish on the corresponding local system, or it is globally
constant. We use this to prove that quantum Reidemeister torsion is invariant and can be
expressed in terms of open Gromov-Witten invariants of L.

1. Introduction and results

Given a closed monotone Lagrangian manifold L of a symplectic manifold (M, ω), one can
wonder how restricted its topology can be. Since every closed manifold is a Lagrangian of its
cotangent bundle (the zero-section), some restrictions must be imposed on M or L in order
to get non-trivial results. Without restricting M, one can impose that L is displaceable by
some Hamiltonian isotopy, wich implies that its Lagrangian quantum homology QH(L), in
the sense of Biran-Cornea [BC09b], vanishes. However, since the work of Cho [Cho08], a
milder restriction can be imposed. Indeed, Lagrangian quantum homology can be twisted
by complex one dimensional representations, also called local systems, ϕ : H1(L; Z)/Tor →
C×, and the resulting homology is denoted by QH ϕ(L). Then, one considers Lagrangians
endowed with a representation such that QH ϕ(L) vanishes, in which case we say that L is
ϕ-narrow. These pairs (L, ϕ) are called trivial objects of the (monotone) Fukaya category
of M and are the subject of this paper. Moreover, by a theorem of Auroux, Kontsevich,
Seidel, it is expected that most pairs (L, ϕ) are trivial, see §6.1 and Corollary 6.1.3 for more
on this. Therefore, it is important to study these trivial objects, as they give information on
Lagrangians which may also admit non-narrow representations.

For a pair (L, ϕ), Oh [Oh96] introduced a spectral sequence of algebras converging to its
quantum homology ring. Moreover, on the ﬁrst page, the algebra structure is the intersection

product on the homology ring of the Lagrangian. Hence, a natural question in the present
context is then:

Question. Given a trivial object (L, ϕ) in the monotone Fukaya category of (M, ω), are there
restrictions on the homology ring of L?

We pay special attention to closed orientable 3-manifolds. In this case, there is a 3-form

given by the triple intersection product

IR : H2(L; R) ⊗ H2(L; R) ⊗ H2(L; R) → H0(L; R) ∼= R

Here, R is a ring which will be mostly Z or a ﬁeld F. This form was studied by Sullivan
in [Sul75], who showed that any integral 3-form on a free abelian group of ﬁnite rank b can
be realized as the intersection form IZ of a closed, orientable 3-manifold with second Betti
number equal to b.

If one considers the symplectic manifold (M, ω) = (C3, ω0 = P dxj ∧ dyj), then there are

strong topological restrictions on its orientable Lagrangians, and the corresponding 3-form
has maximal rank.

Theorem 1.0.1.

• (Damian [Dam15, Theorem 1.5], Evans-K¸edra [EK14, Theorem
B]) If L is a closed, orientable and monotone Lagrangian 3-manifold of (C3, ω0),
then L is diﬀeomorphic to a product S1 × Σg, where Σg is an orientable surface of
genus g.

• (Fukaya [Fuk06, Theorem 11.1]) If L is a closed, orientable and prime Lagrangian

3-manifold of (C3, ω0), then L is diﬀeomorphic to a product S1 × Σg.

In this paper, we consider any monotone 6-dimensional symplectic manifold (M 6, ω), con-
vex at inﬁnity whenever it is not closed. L will always be a closed, orientable, monotone,
Lagrangian 3-manifold in (M, ω). In order to state our result, we ﬁrst introduce quickly the
main characters of our story. The precise deﬁnitions are given further below.

1.0.1. Representations, Landau-Ginzburg superpotential. Let hom0(H1; C×) be the set of
complex one-dimensional representations of H1(L; Z) that are equal to 1 on the torsion
subgroup. By choosing a basis ¯e1, . . . , ¯eb1(L;Z) of the free part of H1(L; Z) and a correspond-
ing dual basis z1, . . . , zb1(L;Z), hom0(H1; C×) ∼= (C×)b1(L;Z) is identiﬁed with a complex torus
of dimension b1(L; Z). On this space, the Landau-Ginzburg superpotential is a holomorphic
Laurent polynomial P : hom0(H1; C×) → C which encodes Maslov index two open Gromov-
Witten invariants of (M, L) with one marked point.

1.0.2. Twisted Lagrangian quantum homology and associated invariants. Let ϕ ∈ hom0(H1; C×),
and consider a triple D = (f, g, J) made of a Riemannian metric g on L, a Morse-Smale func-
tion f : L → R and an almost complex structure J compatible with the symplectic form ω.

Then, there is an associated pearl complex Cϕ(D) whose homology, QH ϕ(L), called La-
grangian quantum homology, depends only on ϕ. There is a spectral sequence E∗,ϕ, ﬁrst
deﬁned by Oh [Oh96], whose ﬁrst page is given by H∗(L; C) and which converges to QH ϕ(L).
The space of wide representations is deﬁned as W1 = {ϕ ∈ hom0(H1; C×) | QH ϕ(L) ∼=
H∗(L; C)}. Similarly, the space of narrow representations is N1 = {ϕ ∈ hom0(H1; C×) | QH ϕ(L) =
0}. The narrow/wide conjecture states that the complement of W1 is N1. The discriminant
of L (Biran-Cornea [BC12, §4.3]) is the function

∆ : W1 → C

ϕ = (z1, . . . zb1(L;Z)) 7→ (−1)nb1(L;Z)+1z2

1 · · · z2

b1(L;Z) det(cid:18) ∂2P

∂zi∂zj

(ϕ)(cid:19)

1.0.3. Quantum Reidemeister torsion. Given a narrow representation ϕ ∈ N1, the associated
pearl complex Cϕ(D) is acyclic, therefore its torsion is deﬁned.
It is a complex number
denoted by τϕ(L, D). We started the study of this quantity in our previous work [Cha15],
where we proved that it does not depend on generic choice of data D for a certain class of
monotone Lagrangians. In the current paper, we prove that it is also invariant for orientable
3-manifolds and express it as a certain rational function of open Gromov-Witten invariants.

1.0.4. Open Gromov-Witten invariants. Given two cycles x ∈ H1(L; Z), y ∈ H2(L; Z) and a
homotopy class B ∈ π2(M, L) of minimal Maslov index two, recall that GW B
0,2(x, P D(y)) ∈ Z
denotes genus zero open Gromov-Witten invariants, in the homotopy class B, with two
marked points intersecting the cycles x and P D(y), the Poincar´e dual of y. Fix also a
representation ϕ ∈ hom0(H1; C×). These deﬁne a linear map

Aϕ : H1(L; C) → H2(L; C)

x 7→ XB, y∈H2

GW B

0,2(x, P D(y))ϕ(∂B)y

Similarly, let w, z ∈ H2(L; C), and [L] ∈ H3(L; Z) be the fundamental class. Then, there is
a bilinear map

Qϕ : H2(L; C) ⊗ H2(L; C) → C

1.1. Main result. Let e1, . . . eb2(L;Z) denote a basis of the free part of H2(L; Z), such that
¯ei ∈ H1(L; Z) is Poincar´e dual to it. Finally, denote by Torev(L) (resp. Torodd(L)) the
torsion subgroup of ⊕kH2k(L; Z) (resp. ⊕kH2k+1(L; Z)). All determinants in the theorem
are computed with respect to the basis ei, ¯ej (see also Lemma 2.1.2).

Theorem A. Let L be a monotone, closed and orientable Lagrangian 3-manifold in (M, ω),
with minimal Maslov class NL = 2. Suppose that there exists a narrow representation ϕ =
(z1, . . . , zb1(L;Z)). There is the following alternative:

(1) b1(L; Z) is odd:

then E∗,ϕ collapses at the second page, there exists i such that
(ϕ) 6= 0 and IC(ei, ·, ·) is symplectic on H2(L; C)/heii. If moreover b1 ≥ 3, then

W1 = CritP. Quantum Reidemeister torsion is given by the formula

|Torodd(L)|

∂P
∂zi

(ϕ))b1(L;Z)−3
(zi
det IC(ei, ·, ·)|H2/heii

(2) b1(L; Z) is even: then E∗,ϕ collapses at the third page, IC = 0 and P is constant. If
moreover W1 6= ∅, then the discriminant of L satisﬁes ∆(W1) = 0. Finally, Aϕ is an
isomorphism, Qϕ is symplectic, and

τϕ(L)b1(L;Z) = (cid:18) |Torev(L)|

|Torodd(L)|(cid:19)b1(L;Z) det Ab1(L;Z)−1

ϕ

det Qϕ

∈ C×/ ± 1

Corollary 1.1.1. Suppose that b1 is odd and L satisﬁes the hypotheses of the theorem, then
L is rationally prime, i.e. if L is a connected sum, L = A#B, then either A or B is a
Q-homology sphere.

Note that if NL > 2 and there exists a narrow representation, then it is fairly straight-
forward to prove that L must be a rational homology sphere and that NL = 4. We prove
the theorem for other ﬁelds than C, with the restriction that the characteristic is diﬀerent
than two and does not divide the order of the torsion subgroup of H∗(L; Z). The proof of
the theorem is done in many diﬀerent steps, spread through the whole paper, and is written
in §6.2. Let us give a list of the steps and point to the relevant sections.

Step 1: The spectral sequence and the homology ring. In §3, we prove that if E∗,ϕ collapses
at the second page, then IC(ei, ·, ·) is symplectic on H2(L; C)/heii, from which we get that
b1(L; Z) is odd. Furthermore, if E∗,ϕ collapses at the third page, we get IC = 0. Note that
this does not imply, a priori, that b1(L; Z) is even. This is done in Step 3.

Step 2: The invariance of torsion. In §4, we prove that quantum Reidemeister torsion does
not depend on the choice of generic pearl data triple D. The most interesting part is when
the spectral sequence E∗,ϕ collapses at the third page, where we discuss brieﬂy bifurcation

4

analysis. We also give formulas for τϕ(L) in terms of the diﬀerentials in E∗,ϕ.

In §5, we express the formulas from Step 2 in
Step 3: Open Gromov-Witten invariants.
terms of the open Gromov-Witten invariants Aϕ and Qϕ. Moreover, we show that Aϕ is an
isomorphism and Qϕ is a symplectic form on H2(L; C), provided that E∗,ϕ collapses at the
third page. This proves that b1(L; Z) must be even in this case.

Step 4: The superpotential. Finally, we translate our results in terms of the Landau-Ginzburg
superpotential in §6.1.

1.2. Examples. The most interesting conclusion of Theorem A concerns Lagrangians with
an even ﬁrst Betti number. Unfortunately, we have to confess that the only examples of this
type we could ﬁnd are rational homology spheres. It seems that real parts of Fano 3-folds
may provide a source of non trivial examples, see the discussion below.

1.2.1. Odd ﬁrst Betti number. These are rather easy to come by. Indeed, let S1 be a con-
tractible, monotone, circle in a Riemann surface (Σ, ω1), possibly not compact. Let Σg be
a monotone, orientable Lagrangian surface in a symplectic 4-manifold (M 4, ω2). Then the
product embedding S1 × Σg ⊂ (Σ × M, ω1 ⊕ ω2) admits a narrow representation and has
minimal Maslov class two.

1.2.2. Even ﬁrst Betti number. The Chiang Lagrangian [Chi04] is a rational homology sphere
in CP 3 with minimal Maslov class two.
Its Lagrangian quantum homology was studied
extensively by Evans-Lekili [EL15] and vanishes over ﬁelds of characteristic zero, hence the
hypotheses of Theorem A are satisﬁed. Other Chiang-type examples were further studied
by Smith [Smi].

There are many closed orientable 3-manifolds L with even ﬁrst Betti numbers whose
cohomology ring satisﬁes IC = 0. For example, any orientable circle bundle with a non-
vanishing Euler class, or more generally, Seifert ﬁbered spaces with a non-vanishing Euler
class. These can also be made Lagrangian, albeit not monotone, as real parts of complex
3-folds, see Mangolte [Man14, Theorems 2.13 & 4.6] for an extensive survey. However,
the methods mentionned there do not seem to work for Fano 3-folds, whose real parts
would yield monotone Lagrangians. One would then need to check that they admit narrow
representations, so that the hypotheses of Theorem A are satisﬁed. We will not pursue this
direction here.

1.3. Acknowledgments. Most of this research was done during a stay at the Institute
Mittag-Leﬄer during the Fall semester 2015, where I beneﬁted from conversations with many
of the participants. I would like to thank the Institute and the organizers of this special

thematic semester for the ﬁnancial support and for providing such an excellent working
environment.

2. Definitions and setting

This whole section follows very closely the presentation of similar material in our previous

work [Cha15, §2 and 3].

2.1. The torsion of a chain complex. We adapt Milnor’s presentation from [Mil66] to
our context.

2.1.1. Non-acyclic complexes: torsion subgroups. Let 0 → Cn → Cn−1 → · · · → C1 → C0 →
0 be a bounded chain complex over a ﬁeld F such that each Ci has a preferred ﬁnite basis
ci = (ci,1, . . . , ci,ri). Given any vector space V , we call two bases b1, b2 of V equivalent if the
change of basis matrix [b1/b2] has determinant plus or minus one.

Denote by Bi the image of the boundary morphism d : Ci+1 → Ci, by Zi+1 its kernel and
the resulting homology by Hi(C∗) = Zi/Bi. Choose bases bi of Bi and hi of Hi. Then, there
are split exact sequences

(1)

0

0

/ Zi

/ Bi

/ Ci

/ Zi

d

/ Bi−1

/ 0

/ Hi

/ 0

which combine to yield a new basis bi−1hibi of Ci.

Deﬁnition 2.1.1. The torsion is deﬁned as

τ (C∗, c∗, h∗) =

n

Yi=0

det[hibibi−1/ci](−1)i ∈ F×/ ± 1.

It is independent of the choice of basis bi and of the splittings of the exact sequences,

however it does depend on the equivalence class of the bases c∗ and h∗, since

(2)

τ (C∗, c′

∗, h′

∗) = τ (C∗, c∗, h∗)

n

Yi=0

det[ci/c′

i] det[hi/h′
i]

Now, let f : X → R be a Morse-Smale function on a closed manifold X. Denote by Ci the
Morse complex over Z generated by critical points of f of index i, with a Z-basis ci given by
these critical points. As above, let Bi and Zi be the groups of boundaries and cycles, which
i ⊕ Tor(Hi(L; Z)) =
are free Z-modules, say Bi
Zr(i)−k(i) ⊕ Z/a1Z ⊕ · · · ⊕ Z/as(i)Z. By standard algebra for modules over principal ideal
domains, one can choose bases of Zi and Bi such that, in the second exact sequence of (1),

∼= Zr(i). Write Hi(L; Z) = H free

∼= Zk(i) and Zi

we have

(3)

In other words, there is only one free extension (of a given rank) of Hi(L; Z) by another free
module (of a given rank), and, in the appropriate bases, it is given by the obvious maps
written above. Moreover, the relevant change of bases matrices have determinants equal to
±1, since they give isomorphisms of free Z-modules.

Now, take a ﬁeld F whose characteristic does not divide any of the al’s and tensor both
sequences in (1) with F. This preserves exactness, boundaries, and cycles, by assumption
on the characteristic. The following is rather trivial, it follows for instance by applying
the universal coeﬃcient theorem for homology, but it will be useful for computing quantum
Reidemeister torsion later on.

Lemma 2.1.2. Let F be a ﬁeld whose characteristic does not divide |Tor(H∗(L; Z))|. Then a
Z-basis h∗ of the free part of H∗(L; Z) gives a basis of H∗(L; F), by taking h∗ ⊗ 1. Moreover,
any two such bases are equivalent.

Then, the second sequence (considered over F) in (1) is now free, hence it splits, and is given
j=1 aj = |TorHi(L; Z)| ∈

by (3) in the basis h∗ ⊗ 1. Therefore, we get det[hibibi−1/ci] = Qs(i)
|Tor(Hi(L; Z))|−1i

F×/ ± 1. Finally,

τ (C∗ ⊗ F, c∗ ⊗ 1, h∗ ⊗ 1) = Yi

Simply put, torsion equals torsion! We will often abbreviate this formula as

(4)

τ (C∗ ⊗ F, c∗ ⊗ 1, h∗ ⊗ 1) =

|Torev(L)|
|Torodd(L)|

2.1.2. Periodic complexes. Consider now a 2-periodic chain complex C[∗] over a ﬁeld F:

C[1]

d

d

C[0]

Assume that C[∗] is acyclic, choose bases c[i] of C[i] and b[i] of B[i] = d(C[i−1]).

Deﬁnition 2.1.3. The torsion of a 2-periodic acyclic chain complex is

τ2(C[∗], c[∗]) =

det[b[1]b[0]/c[0]]
det[b[0]b[1]/c[1]]

∈ F×/ ± 1.

It is independent of the choice of bases b[i], sections, and equivalence class of c[∗].

2.2. The pearl complex and its torsion. We refer to Biran–Cornea’s papers [BC09a,
BC09b, BC12] for foundations and applications of Lagrangian quantum homology. The
version we use here (with oriented moduli spaces of pearls) is adapted from [BC12].

Throughout the text, (M, ω) is a 6-dimensional symplectic manifold that is connected
and convex at inﬁnity whenever it is not closed. The space of ω-compatible almost complex
structures on M is denoted by Jω. All Lagrangian submanifolds L ⊂ (M, ω) are closed,
connected and orientable 3-manifolds. Moreover, they are endowed with a ﬁxed choice of
orientation and spin structure which we do not write.

Let ω : π2(M, L) → R be given by the symplectic area of discs and µ : π2(M, L) → Z
denote the Maslov index. The positive generator of the image of µ is called the minimal
Maslov index and is denoted by NL. Lagrangians are assumed monotone, that is, there
exists a constant τ > 0 such that

• ω = τ µ
• NL ≥ 2

Since L is orientable, NL is even.

2.2.1. The 2-periodic pearl complex. Fix a triple D = (f, ρ, J), where ρ is a Riemannian
metric, f : L → R a Morse-Smale function and J ∈ Jω.

Set

Ck = Ck(D) = Z[π2(M, L)]hCritkf i,

k = 0, . . . , n = dim L,

where Critkf is the set of critical points with Morse index k and Z[G] is the group ring of a
group G. We write the Morse index of a critical point x as |x|. For a generic triple D, the
pearl diﬀerential is deﬁned by

d : ⊕k Ck(D) → ⊕kCk(D)

Crit f ∋ x 7→ Xy∈Crit f (cid:0) XA∈π2(M,L)

|x|−|y|−1+µ(A)=0

#(P(x, y, A))A(cid:1)y

where #(P(x, y, A)) is the (signed) number of pearls in the homotopy class A going from x
to y. When µ(A) = 0, a pearl is simply a negative gradient ﬂow line of f . This morphism
decomposes as a ﬁnite sum

(5)

d = dM + d1 + . . .

where dM : Ck → Ck−1 is the Morse diﬀerential and di : Ck → Ck−1+iNL counts pearls of
Maslov index iNL. Note that di’s are not diﬀerentials, they do not square to zero, even
though d2 = 0.

8

Since NL is even, k and k − 1 + iNL have diﬀerent parity, hence there is a 2-periodic pearl

complex over Z[π2(M, L)], deﬁned by

C[∗](D) = Mk≡[∗] mod 2

Ck(D),

[∗] = 0, 1

with an induced diﬀerential d : C[∗] → C[∗−1].

The homology of this complex is called the quantum homology of L, denoted by QH[∗](L),
or simply QH(L). It is independent of generic choices of D. If QH(L) = 0, we say that L is
narrow.

2.2.2. Narrow representations and torsion. Fix a ﬁeld F and a ring morphism (by convention,
ring morphisms map 1 to 1)

ϕ : Z[π2(M, L)] → F,

so that F becomes a Z[π2(M, L)]-module. This deﬁnes a 2-periodic chain complex over F by
setting

Cϕ
[∗](D) = C[∗](D) ⊗Z[π2(M,L)] F,

dϕ = d ⊗ 1.

As above, the homology of this new complex, denoted by QH ϕ(L), does not depend on D.
If it vanishes, we say that L is ϕ-narrow, which implies χ(L; F) = 0. Notice that QH(L) = 0
implies QH ϕ(L) = 0 for every ϕ.

The set of narrow representations of L (see also §6.1) over F is deﬁned by

N (L, F) = {ϕ : Z[π2(M, L)] → F | L is ϕ-narrow} .

Given ϕ ∈ N (L, F) and D a generic set of data, there is a preferred basis for Cϕ
by Crit[∗]f . Proceeding as in §2.1.2, we have:

[∗](D) given

Deﬁnition 2.2.1. The quantum Reidemeister torsion of L is

τϕ(L, D) = τ2(Cϕ

[∗](D), Crit[∗]f ) ∈ F×/ ± 1

Remark. Existence of narrow representations is discussed in §6.1, see Corollary 6.1.3.

2.2.3. Oh’s spectral sequence. In this section, we will brieﬂy need Novikov ring coeﬃcients
in order to deﬁne Oh’s spectral sequence [Oh96] in Lagrangian Floer homology. In the pearl
context, this corresponds to the degree spectral sequence of Biran–Cornea [BC09b].

Set Λ = Λ = F[t, t−1] the ring of Laurent polynomials in t. We set deg t = |t| = −NL. Set

and its associated twisted pearl complex (Cϕ, dϕ), there exists a minimal pearl complex,
denoted by (Cϕ

q (L), we have x ◦ y = x · y + h.o.t., where x · y ∈ Hp+q−dim L(L)

Remark. It is essential to use ﬁeld coeﬃcients in order to apply the minimal complex con-
struction, since it makes use of convergence of the degree spectral sequence to the quantum
homology.

3. The cohomology ring of ϕ-narrow Lagrangian 3-folds

Let F be a ﬁeld with char F 6= 2, L a monotone, closed, orientable Lagrangian 3-manifold
in (M, ω), and IF : H2(L; F) ⊗ H2(L; F) ⊗ H2(L; F) → H0(L; F) ∼= F the 3-form deﬁned by
the triple intersection product. We will often write Hi instead of Hi(L; F), to lighten the
notation. Fix a Poincar´e dual basis ei ∈ H2, i = 1, . . . , dim H2 =: b2(L; F) and ¯ei ∈ H1 , so
that ei · ¯ej = δi,jp, where p is the generator of H0. One easily checks that

(7)

ei · ej = Xk

IF(ei, ej, ek)¯ek.

Theorem 3.0.3. Suppose that there exists a narrow representation ϕ : π2(M, L) → F×,
where char F 6= 2. Then, either IF is identically zero or there exists i such that IF(ei, ·, ·) is
a symplectic form on H2/heii.

Remark 3.0.4. As observed by Sullivan [Sul75], any 3-form on a free abelian group of rank
b can be realized as the intersection form of a closed orientable 3-manifold with b2(L) = b.
Moreover, the space of such forms depends on 1
6b(b − 1)(b − 2) parameters, modulo the action
of the group GL(b) of dimension b2. For related results over Z/nZ, see the work of Turaev
[Tur83, Tur84].

Proof. We assume that dim H2 ≥ 2, otherwise there is nothing to prove. Since L is ϕ-
narrow, its minimal Maslov number must be NL = 2, for degree reasons. Fix a generic pearl
data triple (f, ρ, J) and consider the associated degree spectral sequence Er,ϕ
∗,∗ twisted by ϕ.
Denote by v the collapsing page, i.e. v = min{r | Er,ϕ
6= 0}. We have either
v = 2 or v = 3, as L is ϕ-narrow and dim L = 3.
Case 1: v = 3. Since the homology of the ﬁrst page does not vanish, we must have
0 = dϕ
null, since L is ϕ-narrow, hence the map Aϕ := dϕ
Lemma 3.0.8, dϕ
we have, for all i, j,

1∗ : H1 → H2 is an isomorphism. Finally, by
1∗ is a derivation (see related results of Buhovski [Buh10]),

1∗ : H2 → H3. For degree reasons,

survives to E∞,ϕ, and the latter is

1∗ : H2 → H3
1∗ : H1 → H2

1∗(p) = 0. Since dϕ

∗,∗ ≡ 0, Er−1,ϕ

∗,∗

ker dϕ
im dϕ

0 = dϕ

1∗(δi,jp) = dϕ

1∗(¯ei · ej) = dϕ

1∗(¯ei) · ej + ¯ei · dϕ

1∗(ej) = Aϕ(¯ei) · ej

The map Aϕ is an isomorphism, therefore the product vanishes identically on H2 and IF ≡ 0.
Note that it was not necessary to assume that char F 6= 2 in this case.

11

Case 2: v = 2. Since the homology of the ﬁrst page is zero, we have the following exact
sequence, where the maps are given by dϕ
1∗:

0

/ H0

/ H1

/ H2

/ H3

/ 0

1∗(ei) = riL. By exactness, we have that dϕ

Set dϕ
1∗ : H2 → H3 is surjective, and we can
assume without loss of generality that r1 6= 0. Then a basis for the kernel of dϕ
1∗ is given
by B := {ei − ri
e1 | i ≥ 2}, which is not empty since we assume dim H2 ≥ 2. Again by
r1
exactness, this gives a basis for the image of dϕ
1∗ : H1 → H2. Moreover, left-multiplication
(in the Morse homology ring) by e1
·) : B → B is the
r1
identity on B, as a quick check shows (see also [Cha15, Lemma 4.0.6]). Therefore, we have
linearly independent vectors given by

and IF(e1, ·, ·) is a non-degenerate two-form on H2/he1i.

(cid:3)

A couple of direct corollaries are worth mentionning.

Corollary 3.0.5. Suppose that the second possibility in the theorem occurs. Then the di-
mension of H2(L; F) is odd. Moreover, L is F-prime, i.e. if L = A#B, then either A or B
is an F-homology sphere.

In Proposition 5.1.1, we prove that whenever the ﬁrst possibility in the theorem occurs,

then b2(L; F) is even. Combined with the proof of Theorem 3.0.3, this yields:

Corollary 3.0.6. Suppose that there exists one narrow representation. Then the collapsing
page of E∗,ϕ

∗,∗ does not depend on ϕ ∈ N (L; F), it depends only on the form IF.

Proposition 3.0.7. If there exists a vector ei such that IF(ei, ·, ·) is symplectic on H2/heii
and b2 ≥ 2, then H∗(L; F) is generated as a ring by H2. Conversely, if H∗(L; F) is generated
by H2, then there exists a vector ei such that IF(ei, ·, ·) is symplectic on H2/heii.

The assumption on the Betti number is necessary, as seen by considering S1 × S2.

Proof. Linear algebra.

Lemma 3.0.8. Given any monotone Lagrangian L of dimension n, with minimal Maslov
number NL = 2, the maps dϕ

Proof. Let {ei} be a basis of Hn−1 and {¯ei} denote the corresponding Poincar´e dual basis of
H1. By the divisor axiom for open Gromov-Witten invariants, we have

d1∗(ei) = XA∈π2(M,L)

#P(ei, L; A)ϕ(A)L = XA

m0(A)ϕ(A)(ei · [∂A])L,

where P(ei, L; A) is the space of pearls going from ei to L in the class A, m0(L, A) denotes
the oriented number of Maslov index two pseudoholomorphic discs going through a generic
point, in the homotopy class A (see also §6.1) and [∂A] denotes the homotopy class of the
boundary of A. Moreover, similar considerations yield

d1∗(p) = Xi XA∈π2(M,L)

#P(p, ¯ei; A)ϕ(A)¯ei = Xi XA

m0(A)ϕ(A)([∂A] · ei)¯ei

4. Invariance of torsion

Throughout this whole section, we let F be a ﬁeld such that char F does not divide
|Tor(L)| and is diﬀerent than two. This implies that the Betti numbers of L over F and Z
coincide, see Lemma 2.1.2. We also ﬁx a generic pearl data triple D = (f, ρ, J) on L and let
ϕ : π2(M, L) → F× be a narrow representation.

4.1. The second page collapses. This was essentially proven in [Cha15]. Using the low
dimension of L, we make the formulas appearing there more explicit. First suppose that the
narrow representation ϕ is such that the degree spectral sequence collapses at the second
page. We use the notations from §3. By the proof of Theorem 3.0.3, the ﬁrst page of
{E∗,ϕ

∗,∗ ; F} yields an acyclic chain complex

/ H1(L; F)

dϕ

We denote the torsion of this chain complex, with respect to the basis h∗ ⊗ 1 (see §2 and
Lemma 2.1.2) by τϕ(H∗, dϕ
1∗, h∗ ⊗ 1). It does not depend on the generic choice of pearl data
triple D, see [Cha15]. From [Cha15, Theorem 4.0.4], we have τϕ(L, D) = τϕ(L, h∗ ⊗ 1) =
|Torev(L)|
|Torodd(L)|
spectral sequence, we set Bi = Im{dϕ
these vector spaces. By assumption, the map dϕ
and dϕ
b2 = {ei −

1∗ : Hi−1 → Hi}. We now ﬁnd explicit bases bi for
1∗ : H2 → H3 is surjective. Set b3 = [L]
1∗(ei) = ri[L]. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that r1 6= 0. By exactness,

| i ≥ 2} is a basis of B2. By Lemma 3.0.8, dϕ

τϕ(H∗, dϕ

4.2. The third page collapses. Suppose that the narrow representation ϕ is such that the
associated degree spectral sequence {E∗,ϕ

D : H0(L; F) → H3(L; F). However, this map is
deﬁned by using an implicit identiﬁcation E2,ϕ ∼= H(E1,ϕ, d1,ϕ).
Instead, let us compute
the diﬀerential on the second page by using the deﬁnition of the spectral sequence coming
from the degree ﬁltration on the pearl complex. To do this, we closely follow the book from
McCleary [McC01, Proof of Theorem 2.6]. Note that we are using an increasing ﬁltration.

4.3. Bifurcation and spectral sequences. In order to prove invariance of torsion in the
previous section, we showed the key fact that α−M6M1 = rϕ by looking closely at the degree
spectral sequence. However, the usual way to prove invariance is by studying the possible
bifurcations that can happen in a generic one parameter family of complexes. We explain
here why the spectral sequence argument actually encodes all signiﬁcant bifurcations. Let
us stress that we do not state any precise theorems, nor do we provide proofs. A precise
statement relating bifurcations and spectral sequences remains to be found. The discussion
here was inspired by an article from Hutchings [Hut02, §3.6].

1 , M f

For simplicity, assume that L admits a perfect Morse function f , with a minimum p and
a maximum [L]. Then, the matrices M f
6 above are equal to zero and the coeﬃcient αf
is given by a count of pearls from p to [L]. Assume that f is now changed to a Morse-Smale
function h by adding a single pair of critical points x, y, such that |x| = 1,
|y| = 2, and
such that there is a unique negative gradient ﬂow line γ from y to x. In other words, h is
obtained from f by a single birth of critical points. For this h, the coeﬃcients αh, M h
1 , M h
6
may be diﬀerent than the ones for f . By deﬁnition, αh − M h
1 counts points in the space
P(p, x; h) × γ × P(y, [L]; h), where P(z, w; g) is the space of pearls from z to w for a function
g. Performing a death of x, y, i.e. slowly shrinking γ to a degenerate critical point z0, then
removing that point, we get a one parameter family of functions ft and a cobordism between
P(m, [L]; f ) and P(p, x; h) × γ × P(y, [L]; h). Therefore, the counts on both sides of this
cobordism yield the same number, given by rϕ.

Remark. The main technical diﬃculty required to make this discussion precise is the gluing
of a pearl at a degenerate critical point. Moreover, a complete description of all possible
generic bifurcations in the space of pearls of a Lagrangian 3-fold should be given, as well as
a comparison of the pearl diﬀerentials on each side of these bifurcations.

5. Torsion, quantum product, and open Gromov-Witten invariants

5.1. The quantum product. In this section, we express the coeﬃcient rϕ from Theorem
4.2.2 in terms of the chain-level quantum product on the minimal pearl complex. Under the
assumptions of Theorem 4.2.2, for any two classes x, y ∈ H2(L; F), we have, by Theorem
3.0.3, x·y = 0. Therefore, the quantum product on the minimal pearl complex (H∗(L; F), δϕ)
(see §2.2.4) deﬁnes a bilinear functional

Qϕ : H2(L; F) ⊗ H2(L; F) → H3(L; F) ∼= F

Compare with the quadratic form deﬁned by Biran-Cornea in [BC12, §4.1].

In order to compute the morphism rϕ : H0(L; F) → H3(L; F), we pick Poincar´e dual bases
of the free part of H1(L; Z) and H2(L; Z) and tensor them with 1F. Denote by ¯ei the
associated basis vectors of H1(L; F) and by ej the basis of H2(L; F), as was done in §3. On
the chain level, we have ¯ei ◦ ej = ¯ei · ej + h.o.t., since the minimal quantum product is a
deformation of the intersection product. Also, h.o.t. is an element of H2, for degree reasons.
By assumption on the narrow representation ϕ, δϕ|H2 vanishes. Therefore, δϕ(¯ei ◦ ej) =
δϕ(¯ei · ej) = δi,jrϕ, where δi,j is the Kronecker delta. Moreover, by deﬁnition of δϕ, we see
that δϕ|H1 = Aϕ. Hence, we have

(11)

δi,jrϕ = δϕ(¯ei ◦ ej) = δϕ(¯ei) ◦ ej + ¯ei ◦ δϕ(ej) = Aϕ(¯ei) ◦ ej = Qϕ(Aϕ(¯ei), ej)

On the other hand, ¯ei · ej = ej · ¯ei, so δi,jrϕ = δϕ(ej ◦ ¯ei) = −Qϕ(ej, Aϕ(¯ei)). Recall that
Aϕ : H1 → H2 is an isomorphism. Therefore, Qϕ is in fact antisymmetric. With respect to
the basis Aϕ(¯ei) ⊗ ej of H2 ⊗ H2, Qϕ is given by a diagonal matrix of dimension b2(L; Z)
with diagonal entries all equal to rϕ 6= 0. Summarizing this discussion, we have:

Proposition 5.1.1. Qϕ is a symplectic form on H2(L; F), hence b2(L; F) = b2(L; Z) is even.

In the basis ei ⊗ ej of H2 ⊗ H2, det Qϕ =

rb2(L;Z)
ϕ
det Aϕ

.

By Lemma 2.1.2, a Poincar´e dual basis of H∗(L; F) is equivalent to any bases h∗ ⊗ 1 of
H∗(L; F). From Theorem 4.2.2, we conclude that for every narrow representation ϕ that
vanishes on the third page, the quantum Reidemeister torsion satisﬁes

5.2. Open Gromov-Witten invariants. Consider A ∈ π2(M, L) such that µ(A) = 2
and denote by M(A; J) = {u : (D2, S1) → (M, L) | ¯∂J u = 0,
[u] = A} the space of
pseudoholomorphic discs in the homotopy class A. These are automatically simple curves,
as µ(A) = 2 and L is monotone. Therefore, for generic J, M(A; J) is a smooth orientable
manifold of dimension dim L + µ(A). It is in fact a closed manifold because of monotonicity
and it’s bordism class does not depend on J. In other words, given two regular J0, J1 and a
generic path J = {Jt, t ∈ [0, 1]} between them, there is a smooth, oriented, closed cobordism

between M(A; J0) and M(A; J1), given by St∈[0,1] M(A; Jt).

Denote by Confk(S1) ⊂ (S1)k the conﬁguration space of k points on the circle, in clockwise

order. There are evaluation maps

evk : M(A; J) × ((S1)k\∆)/G → Lk

(u, θ1, . . . , θk) 7→ (u(θ1), . . . , u(θk))

where ∆ = {(x1, · · · xk) | ∃i 6= j, xi = xj} is the “fat” diagonal of tuples of points which are
not pairwise distinct.

−→evk : M(A; J) × Confk(S1)/G → Lk

(u, θ1, . . . , θk) 7→ (u(θ1), . . . , u(θk))

Here, G is the group of biholomorphisms of D2, acting on the spaces by g · (u, θ1, . . . , θk) =
(u ◦ g−1, g(θ1), . . . , g(θk)) . Note that neither ((S1)k\∆) nor Confk(S1) are compact. These
maps are used to deﬁne the following open Gromov-Witten invariants:

GW A

m0(L, A) = deg ev1 ∈ Z
0,2(X, Y ) = #{ev−1
0,3(X, Y, Z) = #{ev−1
0,3(X, Y, Z) = #{−→ev−1

3 (X × Y × Z) | |X| + |Y | + |Z| = 2 dim L − 2} ∈ Z

Here, X, Y, Z are elements of H∗(L; F), |X| represents the homological degree of a class,
and the counts of elements are oriented. We refer to McDuﬀ-Salamon’s book [MS04] for
the deﬁnition of these invariants in the case of holomorphic spheres. These counts are
independent of generic J and ﬁnite in our context for two reasons. First, the bordism class
of M(A, J) does not depend on J. Second, the dimension restriction on X, Y, Z imply that
they are pairwise disjoint, so that the maps evk (resp. −→evk) extend to the compactiﬁcation
of ((S1)k\∆) (resp. Confk(S1)) and are transversal to the cycles X × Y (resp. X × Y × Z).

Proposition 5.2.1. The maps Aϕ : H1(L; F) → H2(L; F) and Qϕ : H2(L; F) ⊗ H2(L; F) → F
from §4 satisfy:

GW A

0,2(x, P D(y))ϕ(A)y

Aϕ(x) = Xµ(A)=2, y∈Hi+1
Qϕ(x ⊗ y) = Xµ(A)=2

0,3(x, y, p)ϕ(A)

Qϕ(x ⊗ y) + Qϕ(y ⊗ x) = Xµ(A)=2

GW A

0,3(x, y, p)ϕ(A)

where p is the positive generator of H0(L; Z)

The proof of this proposition is rather direct, it is simply a matter of writing the deﬁnition
of the maps Aϕ and Qϕ in terms of moduli spaces of pearls. With this in hand, formula (12)
shows that the quantum Reidemeister torsion solves a rational function of open Gromov-
Witten invariants of Maslov class two.

Remark 5.2.2. The coeﬃcient rϕ from Theorem 4.2.2 was shown to be equal to α − M6M1 =
Qϕ(Aϕ(¯ei), ei). Note that the term α − M6M1 involves, by deﬁnition, moduli spaces of pearl
trajectories using discs of Maslov index four with two marked points, as well as pearls with
two discs of Maslov index two joined by a ﬂow line. On the other hand, both Qϕ and Aϕ
involve only discs of Maslov index two, with either two or three marked points.

6. The space of complex representations

6.1. The superpotential. We momentarily drop the assumption that L is a 3-manifold
and suppose only that L is a closed, orientable, spin, and monotone Lagrangian submanifold
of (M, ω). We let dim L = n. Our presentation of the superpotential will follow closely
Biran-Cornea’s approach [BC12, §2.4 & 3.3].

Let hom0(H1; C×) be the set of representations of H1(L; Z) that are equal to 1 on the tor-

sion subgroup. The space of wide representations is deﬁned as W1 = {ϕ ∈ hom0(H1; C×) | QH ϕ(L) ∼=
H∗(L; C)}. This space is in fact an algebraic subvariety of hom0(H1; C×), by [BC12, Proposi-
tion 3.1.1]. Similarly, the space of narrow representations is N1 = {ϕ ∈ hom0(H1; C×) | QH ϕ(L) =
0}. The narrow/wide conjecture states that the complement of W1 is N1.

For A ∈ π2(M, L) such that µ(A) = 2, recall from §5.2 that m0(L, A) is the oriented
number of pseudoholomorphic discs in the homotopy class A going through a generic point
of L. By Gromov compactness and monotonicity of L, there are only a ﬁnite number of
classes A for which this number is not zero. The Landau-Ginzburg superpotential is deﬁned
by

(13)

P : hom0(H1; C×) → C, ϕ 7→ XA∈π2(M,L)

m0(L, A)ϕ(∂A)

21

where ∂ : π2(M, L) → π1(L) is the connecting morphism and ∂A is considered as the image of
the Hurewicz morphism π1(L) → H1(L; Z). Note that P(ϕ) is called the obstruction number
of L (with respect to ϕ) and is sometimes denoted by m0(L; ϕ). Pick ¯e1, . . . , ¯eb1, a basis of the
free part of H1(L; Z) and z1, . . . , zb1, the corresponding dual basis of hom0(H1; C×) ∼= (C×)b1,
where b1 = b1(L; Z) is the ﬁrst Betti number. In those coordinates, the superpotential is a
Laurent polynomial given by

P(z1, . . . , zb1) = XA∈π2(M,L)

m0(L, A)z(∂A)1

where ∂A = Pi ¯ei(∂A)i. Pick a basis e1, . . . , ebn−1 of H2(L; Z)/Tor, Poincar´e dual to ¯ei. Let
Cϕ
min = (H∗(L; C), δϕ) be the minimal pearl complex and consider the chain-level quantum
product ◦ on this complex, restricted to Hn−1.

Proposition 6.1.1 (Propositions 3.3.1 and 3.3.4 in [BC12]). For ϕ = (z1, . . . , zb1), we have

In particular, W1 ⊂ CritP. Moreover, if H∗(L; R) is generated as a ring by Hn−1(L; R),
then W1 = CritP and the narrow-wide conjecture is true.

Associated to a Lagrangian of minimal Maslov class two, there is a discriminant function

Finally, we recall a theorem of Auroux, Kontsevich, and Seidel (see Auroux [Aur07, §6] and
Sheridan [She, §2.9] for details). Assume that (M, ω) is a closed symplectic manifold and de-
note by c1 the ﬁrst Chern class of M. Consider the quantum cohomology QH(M, ω), endowed
0 bi(M; C) and
denote by λ1, . . . , λD the eigenvalues of the endomorphism c1⋆ : QH(M, ω) → QH(M, ω).
Then

with the quantum product ⋆, as a complex vector space of dimension D = P2n

Theorem 6.1.2 (Auroux, Kontsevich, Seidel). Consider a representation ϕ = (z1, . . . , zb1) ∈
hom0(H1; C×).
In particular,
P(W1) ⊂ P(hom0(H1; C×)\N1) ⊂ {λ1, . . . , λD}.

If QH ϕ(L) 6= 0, then there exists i such that P(ϕ) = λi.

Since P is a holomorphic function, we get:

Corollary 6.1.3. If P is not constant, then there exist narrow representations.

6.2. Applications to Lagrangian 3-manifolds: Proof of Theorem A. We now come
back to monotone, orientable, closed Lagrangian 3-manifolds.

Proof. By the proof of Theorem 3.0.3 and Proposition 5.1.1, the collapsing page of the
degree spectral sequence depends only on the parity of b2(L; Z), not on the actual narrow
representation, and it restricts the intersection 3-form IC as desired.

If b2 is odd, the second page collapses, which means, by Proposition 6.1.1, that ϕ 6∈ CritP.
Then, torsion is given by formula (8). If b2 ≥ 3, then Propositions 3.0.7 and 6.1.1 imply that
W1 = CritP.

As for the second point, since L is ϕ-narrow and b2(L; Z) is even, the only possibility
is that the degree spectral sequence collapses at the third page. By deﬁnition, this means
that H∗(E1,ϕ) 6= 0, so that ϕ ∈ CritP and hom0(H1; C×)\CritP = ∅, by the ﬁrst point of
Proposition 6.1.1. Therefore, P is constant. Formulae (12) and (14) conclude the proof. (cid:3)
