Abstract

Recently, deviations in ﬂavor observables of ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν have been shown between the predictions in
the Standard Model and the experimental results reported by BaBar, Belle, and LHCb collaborations. One

of the solutions to this anomaly is obtained in a class of leptoquark model with a scalar leptoquark boson
S1, which is a SU (3)c triplet and SU (2)L singlet particle with −1/3 hypercharge interacting with a quark-
lepton pair. With well-adjusted couplings, this model can explain the anomaly and be compatible with all

ﬂavor constraints. In such a case, the S1 boson can be pair-produced at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider
1 → tτ , bντ , and cτ . This paper explores the current 8 and 13 TeV
(LHC) and subsequently decay as S∗
constraints, as well as the detailed prospects at 14 TeV, of this ﬂavor-motivated S1 model. From the current

available 8 and 13 TeV LHC searches, we obtain constraints on the S1 boson mass for MS1 < 400 GeV -

640 GeV depending on values of the leptoquark couplings to fermions. Then we study future prospects for

this scenario at the 14 TeV LHC using detailed cut analyses and evaluate exclusion/discovery potentials for
the ﬂavor-motivated S1 leptoquark model from searches for the (bν)(¯b¯ν) and (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) ﬁnal states. In the

latter case, we consider several scenarios for the identiﬁcation of charm jets. As a result, we ﬁnd that the
S1 leptoquark origin of the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly can be probed with MS1
(cid:46) 600/800 GeV at the 14 TeV
LHC with L = 300/3000 fb
−1 of accumulated data. One can also see that the 14 TeV LHC run II with
−1 can exclude the S1 leptoquark boson up to MS1 ∼ 0.8 TeV at 95% conﬁdence level, whereas a
L = 300 fb
future 14 TeV LHC with L = 3000 fb
−1 data has a potential to discover the S1 leptoquark boson with its
mass up to MS1 ∼ 1.1 TeV with over 5σ signiﬁcance, from the (bν)(¯b¯ν) and/or (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) searches.

INTRODUCTION

An excess in the search for ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν reported by the BaBar and Belle collaborations in
Refs. [1–5] has provided hints of an indirect evidence of new physics, even though the full data

sample was not yet used in the Belle results [3–5]. The observables, deﬁned as

R(D) ≡ B( ¯B → Dτ− ¯ντ )
B( ¯B → D(cid:96)− ¯ν(cid:96))

, R(D∗) ≡ B( ¯B → D∗τ− ¯ντ )
B( ¯B → D∗(cid:96)− ¯ν(cid:96))

,

(1)

where (cid:96) = e or µ, are introduced for these processes in order to reduce theoretical uncertainties and
separate the issue of the determination of |Vcb| from new physics study. The standard model (SM)
predicts precise values of R(D(∗)) with the help of the heavy quark eﬀective theory [6, 7]. In May

2015, the latest results from the BaBar [1, 2], Belle [8] and LHCb [9] collaborations have ﬁnally

appeared all together. As a result, we can see the signiﬁcant deviations between the combined

experimental results [1, 2, 8, 9] and the SM predictions [10], which reads

R(D)exp. − R(D)SM = 0.089 ± 0.051 ,
R(D∗)exp. − R(D∗)SM = 0.070 ± 0.022 ,

(2)

(3)

where the combined experimental results are privately evaluated assuming Gaussian distributions

and the experimental and theoretical uncertainties are taken into account in the errors. The

standard deviation with a correlation is also shown in Fig. 1 and we can see that the discrepancy
reaches ∼ 4σ.
It is interesting that both of the deviations are “excesses” of the experimental
results from the SM predictions despite negative correlations (∼ −0.3) in the experiments. We put
individual and combined values of the experimental results in Appendix A.

In recent years, several new physics scenarios have been investigated with respect to the excesses.

In particular, as the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) can give a large contribution to the tauonic
B meson decays [11–15], it is studied in Refs. [16–21] to explain the large deviation in ¯B →
D(∗)τ ¯ν. Their results imply that it is hard to accommodate the excesses in R(D) and R(D∗)

simultaneously for the type-I, II, X, and Y 2HDMs, whereas there is still allowed parameter space for

the general 2HDM. The R-parity violating minimal supersymmetric standard model is considered

in Refs. [16, 22–24]. It turns out that this scenario is not likely to explain the excesses at the same
time with satisfying the constraint from ¯B → Xsν ¯ν. The W (cid:48) model is also studied in the context
of ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν in reaction to the recent update [25].

The other feasible and interesting scenario is given in the leptoquark model [26] on which we
focus in this paper. Its potential for explaining the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly is studied in Refs. [10, 16,

the SM prediction. The red and white dots indicate the central values of the SM predictions and the

combined experimental results, respectively. Both the theoretical and experimental uncertainties are taken

into account when calculating the deviation contours.

27, 28]. As a consequence of the recent study in Ref. [10], three types of the leptoquark bosons can
explain the excess without any inconsistency with the constraint from ¯B → Xsν ¯ν. By limiting the
ﬂavor structure of leptoquark couplings, correlations among the other processes are also discussed,
e.g., see Refs. [25, 29, 30]. Note that scalar leptoquarks are also useful for explaining the h → µτ
anomaly in CMS (and ATLAS) [31–34].

To explain the central combined experimental values of R(D(∗)) in any case, somewhat large

couplings of the leptoquark boson to the third (and second, in part) generation quarks and leptons

are required. Hence, the leptoquark search for the third generation at the Large Hadron Collider

(LHC) can be signiﬁcant. Since the color SU (3) charge is assigned, the leptoquark bosons are dom-

inantly pair-produced at the hadron collider and its cross section is independent on the couplings

to fermions. Thus, the direct search of the leptoquark boson gives a constraint on a branching ratio

of its decay into fermions. In this paper, we study the leptoquark search at the LHC, including

the second and third generation quarks and leptons in the ﬁnal state, where it is motivated by the
ﬂavor anomaly in ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν.

This paper is organized as follows. At ﬁrst, after brieﬂy reviewing the leptoquark model, we
show a current status of explaining the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly and constraints from a related ﬂavor
process on the model in Sec. II. Then, we summarize present collider studies at the LHC and apply

them to the model in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we provide detailed analysis cuts, which are performed for

14 TeV LHC searches. In turn, we show our result and discuss future prospects for exclusion and

discovery potentials of the leptoquark boson in Sec. V. Finally, a summary is provided in Sec. VI.

Here, we give a brief review on the possible types of leptoquarks and their lepto-quark interac-
tions. Then we summarize the contribution to the process in b → cτ ¯ν, which leads to ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν
at hadron level, for all possible cases.

A. Classiﬁcation

Some of new physics scenarios, especially for grand uniﬁcations of the fundamental interactions,

contain new scalar and vector bosons which interact with quarks and leptons. This kind of boson

is called as leptoquark and carries both the baryon and lepton numbers together with color and

electric charges. It is known [26] that there are ten types of leptoquarks with the general dimen-
sionless SU (3)c × SU (2)L × U (1)Y invariant and ﬂavour non-diagonal couplings.1 Among them,
six leptoquark (LQ) bosons are relevant for the process b → c(cid:96)¯ν. The Lagrangian for the term

numbers of the leptoquark bosons. Here we deﬁne the fermions in the gauge eigenbasis and follow

the treatment in Ref. [10] such that Yukawa couplings of the up-type quarks and the charged

invariance in general. As widely known, if leptoquark and di-quark interactions coexist, both the baryon and lepton
numbers are violated so that the proton becomes unstable. Note that among the three scalar leptoquarks shown
in Table I, R2 can avoid such an unstable proton (within renormalizable interactions) since no renormalizable
di-quark interaction is written down [35].

B. Contribution to ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν

The leptoquark bosons which have interactions in Eqs. (4)-(6) can contribute to ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν

at the tree level. The eﬀective Lagrangian for b → cτ ¯νl is written [10] as

− Leﬀ = (CSMδlτ + ClV1)OlV1 + ClV2OlV2 + ClS1OlS1 + ClS2OlS2 + ClT OlT ,

where the eﬀective operators are deﬁned as

OlV1 = (¯cLγµbL)(¯τLγµνlL) ,
OlV2 = (¯cRγµbR)(¯τLγµνlL) ,
OlS1 = (¯cLbR)(¯τRνlL) ,
OlS2 = (¯cRbL)(¯τRνlL) ,
OlT = (¯cRσµνbL)(¯τRσµννlL) ,

CSM. The index l denotes the generation of the neutrino which, in general, needs not be the third
one in this case. The CKM matrix element is denoted as Vij ≡ Vuidj . We note that we take the
correct mass eigenstate basis for the fermions and thus the CKM matrix elements appear in the

Wilson coeﬃcients.

As can be seen in Eqs. (14)-(18), several leptoquark bosons with several combinations of the

couplings can contribute to b → cτ ¯νl. Those contributions can be classiﬁed as

It is interesting that the tensor type operator appears in the S1 and R2 type leptoquark models [36].

showing types of the eﬀective operators) from µ = MX to µ = µb, where µb is the mass scale of

the bottom quark, must be taken into account. Due to the fact that the vector and axial-vector
currents are not renormalized and their anomalous dimensions vanish, V1,2 do not receive the
running eﬀect. On the other hand, a scale dependence in the scalar S1,2 and tensor T currents
exist and is approximately evaluated as

where αs(µ) is a running QCD coupling at a scale µ. In the following study, we take µb = 4.2 GeV

and the ﬂavor observables are evaluated at this scale.

The branching ratios of ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν can be calculated, given hadronic form factors that are
precisely estimated with use of the heavy quark eﬀective theory. The formulae in terms of the

helicity amplitudes are found, e.g., in Refs. [10, 16].

C. Present bound from ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν and ¯B → Xsν ¯ν

In Ref. [10], a precise study has been done for the present constraints on the leptoquark bosons
from ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν together with ¯B → Xsν ¯ν, which is also aﬀected by S1, S3, V2, and U3 leptoquark
bosons [37] with partly same combinations of the couplings [10]. The experimental upper limit on
the inclusive branching ratio of ¯B → Xsν ¯ν is given as

B( ¯B → Xsν ¯ν) < 6.4 × 10−4 ,

(21)

at the 90% conﬁdence level (CL) by the ALEPH collaboration [38]. As an illustration for the bound
from ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν and ¯B → Xsν ¯ν, we show the allowed range of the product of the couplings in
Table II. In this table, we assume that only one speciﬁc combination of the product, having a real

or pure imaginary value,2 and one type of leptoquark bosons exist with its mass to be 1 TeV.
We also neglect the couplings with k (cid:54)= 3 due to double Cabibbo suppressions. Namely, we keep
only the leading terms proportional to V33 = Vtb in Eqs. (14)-(18). We can see that the S3 and
U3 leptoquarks cannot satisfy both constraints from ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν and ¯B → Xsν ¯ν at the same
time. The V2 leptoquark has no way to explain the anomaly in ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν. As for the R2 and
U1 leptoquarks, the condition from ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν is fulﬁlled, whereas no constraint comes from
¯B → Xsν ¯ν.

right-hand side of Eq. (22) is not determined. Also, this sign does not aﬀect the physics discussed

in this paper since no interference term appear in the decay sequence of S1 in collider. Such a

large eﬀect, motivated by the ﬂavor anomaly, can be signiﬁcant at the collider search and thus will

III. COLLIDER STUDY

In general, the leptoquark model contains a lot of interaction terms to quarks and leptons and

thus there are many possible signals for a collider search. Given the condition in Eq. (22) motivated
by the anomaly in ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν, the minimal setup is

A. Production process

Since a leptoquark boson has SU (3) color charge, it is expected that a pair production of

leptoquark bosons by the QCD interaction is signiﬁcant. We note that the pair production does

not depend on the couplings deﬁned in Eqs. (4)-(6). In this paper, we investigate the pair-produced

leptoquark bosons at the LHC.3

Thus, our target signal at the LHC is produced through pp → S1S∗

1 , where p indicates a proton.

The production cross section in the leptoquark model has been evaluated at the next-to-leading
order (NLO) [39–41]. With the use of Prospino2 [39], we show the plot for σ(pp → S1S∗

Whereas in our conﬁguration, only the charm, bottom and top quarks appear through the leptoquark interactions,
which are highly parton distribution function (PDF) suppressed or do not exist as a parton when
s = 8 or 14 TeV.
Thereby, only the pair production is relevant in our setup.

The decay branch S∗

1 → cτ becomes the dominant one for S1 with a large mass.

Therefore there are six ﬁnal states of the signal event from the pair production for each lepton

generation (cid:96)i. The ﬁnal states can be categorized by two part (here we omit the particle/anti-

particle assignment):

• independent on the ﬂavor of (cid:96):

(bν(cid:96))(bν(cid:96)),

(cτ )(cτ ),

(bν(cid:96))(cτ ).

• dependent on the ﬂavor of (cid:96):

(t(cid:96))(t(cid:96)),

(t(cid:96))(bν(cid:96)),

(t(cid:96))(cτ ).

The ﬁnal states in the former category are independent on the choice of (cid:96), and thus can be analyzed

without specifying (cid:96). As for the latter category, on the other hand, it is required to investigate

every lepton ﬂavor due to diﬀerences in the eﬃciency, acceptance, and tagging methods.

C. Current status

(bν(cid:96))(¯b¯ν(cid:96)) and (tτ )(¯t¯τ )

Up to the present, there exist two CMS and ATLAS searches which can be applied to the
ﬁnal states of (bν(cid:96))(¯b¯ν(cid:96)) for the LHC run I. In Refs. [42, 43], the ATLAS and CMS collaborations

have searched for the third-generation squarks and obtained exclusion limit in terms of the lightest
bottom squark (˜b1) and lightest neutralino ( ˜χ0

or more jets. Results obtained for M ˜χ0

in the scalar leptoquark model. The CMS analysis in Ref. [43] gives the observed limit on the
branching ratio for LQ → bν(cid:96). On the other hand, a direct bound on third generation leptoquarks
through the (bν(cid:96))(¯b¯ν(cid:96)) channel was provided by ATLAS [44]. In addition, results of the bottom

squark search at the 13 TeV LHC have been recently reported by the ATLAS collaboration [45].

However, since this report lacks information for the observed limit on the cross section, we only

obtain a rough bound for the leptoquark case as shown below. In Ref. [46], the CMS collaboration

has also analyzed the pair production of third-generation scalar leptoquarks decaying into (tτ )(¯t¯τ ).
In Fig. 3, we show the exclusion plot for B(LQ → bν(cid:96)) and B(LQ → tτ ) as a function of the
LQ mass, where LQ indicates an arbitrary scalar leptoquark boson. The result from the ATLAS

search is translated from the one in Ref. [42], by taking into account the NLO cross section of LQ

pair production [41] and by assuming the narrow width approximation for the total decay width

of LQ. We conﬁrmed that our interpretation from the ATLAS bottom squark search is close to the

ATLAS oﬃcial bound in Ref. [42]. Note that the 13 TeV recast shown in the ﬁgure is estimated
by obtaining the observed limit on the cross section as σ(pp → ˜b1 ˜b1) (cid:39) 22.8 fb at the 95% CL
exclusion point [45] and then applying it to the leptoquark case. In this rough estimation, the

mass dependence on the observed limit is neglected since such information is not available in this

report. Hence, this estimation should not be applied to the small LQ mass region less than around

400 GeV because the acceptance times eﬃciency can be drastically changed in this region.

2.

(cτ )(¯c¯τ )

There is a CMS search for the pair-produced scalar leptoquarks decaying to (bτ )(¯b¯τ ) [47]. It is

possible to reinterpret this result to put a constraint on the leptoquark boson decays into (cτ )(¯c¯τ ),

since c-jets are close cousins of b-jets, and the b-tagging algorithms actually have a reasonably high

the probability of mis-identifying c-jets as being b-jets.

In this analysis, jets are b-tagged using the combined secondary vertex (CSV) algorithm with

the loose operating point (CSVL). Furthermore, only one jet is required to be b-tagged, while the

second one is selected whether or not it is b-tagged. The latest preliminary note on b-tagging at
√

s = 8 TeV is obtained in Ref. [51] but does not contain the information we need. However,

The CMS analysis has two relevant signal regions: eτh and µτh, targeting ﬁnal states with two τ

leptons, one decaying hadronically and the other leptonically. In each of these two signal regions
the number of expected events per integrated luminosity L for a scalar LQ boson decaying into cτ

jet has very little inﬂuence on the acceptance times eﬃciency, apart from the tagging requirement,

IV. ANALYSIS AT 14 TEV LHC

Recently, the LHC run II successfully started at an energy of 13 TeV. The updated LHC

experiments at 13 and 14 TeV will greatly improve the discovery potential for the leptoquark

models as well as many other new physics candidates.

In this section, we provide the detailed

procedure of our analyses to obtain our numerical results at the 14 TeV LHC. Based on the

analyses given in this section, prospects and results by simulations for our leptoquark model are
shown in the next section. Our target signals for the analyses are (bν(cid:96))(¯b¯ν(cid:96)) and (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) from the
S(∗)
1 pair production. Signal and background events are simulated in the cluster system provided
at CTPU-IBS.

A. S∗

1 → bν

As already mentioned in the previous section, the event topology of the ﬁnal state from pp →
1 S1 → (bν(cid:96)) (¯b¯ν(cid:96)) is very similar to that from pp → ˜b∗
S∗
1) in a supersymmetric
(SUSY) model, where ˜b1 is the lightest bottom squark and ˜χ0

˜b1 → (b ˜χ0
1 is the lightest neutralino. Therefore,

1) (¯b ˜χ0

1

we can straightforwardly adopt the way of such kind of SUSY searches at the LHC in this category.

The ATLAS oﬃcial prospects for this SUSY search at 14 TeV were communicated in Ref. [53]
assuming that each ˜b1 decays into b ˜χ0
1 with a 100% branching ratio. Details of analysis cuts are
almost the same with the 8 TeV analysis which gave the lower mass bound ∼ 650 GeV for a massless
1 [42]. In our analysis for the (bν(cid:96)) (¯b¯ν(cid:96)) ﬁnal states, we follow the method in Refs. [42, 53]. Before
˜χ0
proceeding with the leptoquark case, we reproduce the 14 TeV prospects for the bottom squark

search reported in Ref. [53], in order to verify our methodology and conﬁrm our result to be robust.

1. Procedure of our analysis

At ﬁrst, we describe procedure of our event simulation and cut analysis. Later, we apply this

procedure to the SUSY and S1 leptoquark cases.

7 GeV,

Trigger cuts for reconstructed objects are required to be pT > 20 GeV,

The ﬁnal state of our targeting process is categorized as “two b-jets with missing particles”.
|η| < 2.8 for jets; pT >
|η| < 2.4 for muons [42], where pT and η
are transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, respectively. After that, an isolation cut based on

the distance between two objects, deﬁned as ∆R =(cid:112)(∆η)2 + (∆φ)2, is imposed on each pair of

|η| < 2.47 for electrons; and pT > 6 GeV,

objects. The isolation ∆R > 0.2 is required between jet and light lepton candidates to remove

jet candidates, and then ∆R > 0.4 is required afterward to remove light lepton candidates [42].

Finally we also require a lepton veto.

The above step is followed by event selection cuts for our analysis. We summarize it in Table III.

We require Emiss

T > 150 GeV for the missing transverse energy and pT (j1(2)) > 150 (130) GeV for
the leading (second) jet transverse momentum. The two leading jets are then required to be

b-tagged. Events are discarded if any other additional jets are hard enough (pT > 50 GeV). For

rejecting QCD multi-jet backgrounds, we use the two variables ∆φmin and meﬀ(k) which are deﬁned

as

meﬀ(k) =

(pjet

backgrounds with two b-jets, (from single/double top productions and Z-bosons in association

with heavy-ﬂavor jets), required as mbb > 200 GeV.

As the ﬁnal step, we adopt contransverse mass cuts for the signal region A (SRA)5 in Refs. [42,

53], which is eﬀective for the case of large mass splitting between parent and invisible-daughter
particles in the decays, (corresponding to ˜b1 and ˜χ0

1 for the SUSY case; S1 and ν for the leptoquark

case). The boost-corrected contransverse mass mCT is designed to measure the masses of pair-

produced semi-invisibly decaying heavy particles [54, 55], and deﬁned as

CT = [ET(v1) + ET(v2)]2 − [pT(v1) − pT(v2)]2 ,
m2

(28)

for the case of two identical decays of heavy particles (v1 and v2) into two visible and invisible

particles. As for the choice of mCT thresholds, the six subdivisions of SRA, such as mCT >

300, 350, 450, 550, 650, 750 GeV as in Ref. [53], are prepared in advance. Among them, an

appropriate threshold is selected so that a signal signiﬁcance is maximized for each model parameter

point (M˜b1

).

/4.

The eﬀects of parton-showering, hadronization, and jet merging are simulated by the

pythia-pgs package [64]

implemented in MadGraph5 aMC@NLO, and the resultant events are

recorded in the StdHep format. Detector simulations are performed using DelphesMA5tune [65], a

modiﬁed version of Delphes 3 [66] provided in the expert mode of MadAnalysis5 [67, 68] ver-

sion 1.1.11.

In DelphesMA5tune, jets are found with the help of the package Fastjet [69,

70]. We use the default conﬁguration for jet ﬁnding written in the modiﬁed Delphes card

“delphesMA5tune card ATLAS 05.tcl” obtained in Ref. [71] (for the anti-kT algorithm [72] with

ParameterR = 0.4 and JetPTMin = 20.0).

Cut analyses to obtain the acceptance times eﬃciency A× ε and the exclusion limit (using CLs
procedure [73]) are done by the expert mode of MadAnalysis5 [65, 67, 68]. The public analysis

code of MadAnalysis5 for the process (top/bottom squarks search: 0 leptons + 2 b-jets) [74] at

8 TeV has been written by G. Chalons and is obtained in the Public Analysis Database [71]. Note

that the public code MctLib which is available in Ref. [75] is used for calculating mCT [54, 55]. We

use this code with minimal modiﬁcation for the 14 TeV case by adding diﬀerent choices in mCT as
shown in Table III. As for (mis-)tagging rates for b-jets, we used the pT and |η|-dependent b-tagging
eﬃciencies considered in Ref. [53].

The production cross section σpp→˜b1˜b∗

is reported in Ref. [76] for 8 TeV and Ref. [77] for 14 TeV. The public codes Prospino2.1 [78]

cross-checked using Prospino2.1.

not consider the pileup eﬀect.

3. Leptoquark case

In the case of the S1 leptoquark, the signal events from the process pp → S∗

1 S1 → (bν(cid:96)) (¯b¯ν(cid:96))
are generated by MadGraph5 aMC@NLO as well, where we have implemented the model ﬁle of the

S1 leptoquark with the help of FeynRules and UFO format [80]. We remind that the relevant free
parameter for the production process pp → S1S∗
1 is only the S1 mass MS1. Exclusion and discovery
1 → b¯ν(cid:96)) and MS1 are subsequently derived. Then,
limits as a function of the branching ratio B(S∗
we follow the same steps with the SUSY case for the parton-showering, hadronization, jet merging,

and detector simulations, through pythia-pgs and DelphesMA5tune. In the leptoquark case, we

adopt the PDF NN23LO1 [81] in parton-level event generations. As for the cut analysis, we apply

the same procedure as in Table III to the signal events for the S1 leptoquark, that is, an appropriate

SRA region is automatically imposed by MadAnalysis5. We employ the SM background events

and its total uncertainties as provided in Ref. [53] for the present case. The pileup eﬀect is not

considered as well.

1 → cτ at the LHC is, however, similar to that of S∗

case in Sec. III C 2. For the 14 TeV search, we directly apply a similar method in Ref. [47] to the
process pp → S∗

1 S1 → (cτ ) (¯c¯τ ).

Some optional modiﬁcations of the method (for requirements of jets and leptons) are also dis-

cussed. As for a (mis-)tagging eﬃciency of c-jet, a further discussion is necessary and we investigate

several cases as will be shown later. Our analysis method based on Ref. [47] is summarized as fol-

lows.

1. Procedure of our analysis

We focus on the events where one of the two tau-leptons decays into a light lepton (cid:96) (electron
or muon) such as τ → (cid:96)¯ν(cid:96)ντ and the other one decays hadronically (denoted as τh) as τh →
hadrons + ντ . In Ref. [47], the two signal regions: eτh and µτh are separately considered. In our

analysis, we consider two cases for (cid:96) = µ and (cid:96) = µ, e.

The trigger cuts are imposed so that the light lepton (jet) satisﬁes the conditions pT > 30 GeV,

|η| < 2.1 (2.4), and the light leptons and jets are isolated as ∆R > 0.5 [47].

At the ﬁrst step after the trigger cut and isolation, we require a τh-jet. In our analysis simulation,

a candidate for τh-jet is selected among reconstructed jets by applying the conditions pT > 50 GeV
and |η| < 2.3. The selected candidate, along with (without) a parton-level tau lepton within the
range ∆R < 0.5, is classiﬁed as a true (fake) τh-jet candidate. Then, we identify a true (fake)
candidate6 as a real τh-jet by taking (mis-)tagging eﬃciency into account. For the true candidate,

we uniformly use a tagging rate of 0.5, found in Refs. [82, 83] in the tight operating point for the

hadron plus splits (HPS) and the multivariate analysis (MVA) algorithms. The mis-tagging rate

for the fake candidate is also obtained in Refs. [82, 83] as a function of pT. For the HPS algorithm,

the following form is obtained through our data ﬁtting,

(1.23193 · 10−10) p3

T + (−1.28812 · 10−7) p2
+ (0.124279) log pT/pT + (−0.00820209).

T + (4.81842 · 10−5) pT

(29)

In our analysis, we adopt the HPS algorithm. A major reason why we perform τh-jet tagging

without using the function installed in DelphesMA5tune is to improve statistics by accepting all

events and subsequently reweighting them based on the tagging rates. The factor for reweighting

is deﬁned as the probability that only one candidate is tagged and others (if exist) are not tagged.

For the next step after τh-jet identiﬁcation, we ﬁnd c-jets in a similar manner to the above.

We note that in our analysis for the (cτ ) (¯c¯τ ) ﬁnal state, we do not tag b-jets since it is not

necessary. Since the present detector simulation does not provide a c-jet tagging module, we need

to implement it in our analysis simulation. Namely, true and fake candidates for c-jet are selected

among reconstructed jets by the same condition with the τh-jet case. Next, we take into account

(mis-)tagging eﬃciencies of c-jet candidates. In our study, we consider three diﬀerent choices for

6 For a τh-jet originating from the true category, the electric charge of the parton-level tau lepton corresponds to that
of the charge of the initial τ of τh. Whereas when a fake candidate is mis-identiﬁed as a τh-jet, the corresponding
electric charge of the initial τ of τh is randomly determined because of the absence of the corresponding data.

the eﬃciencies, reported in diﬀerent studies [50, 84, 85]. The values are written as

(Case 1)

c→c = 50%,

b→c = 20%,

light→c = 0.5%,

from Ref. [50],

(Case 2)

c→c = 19%,

b→c = 13%,

light→c = 0.5%,

from Ref. [84],

(Case 3)

c→c = 40%,

b→c = 25%,

light→c = 10%,

from Ref. [85],

(30)

(31)

(32)

where c→c is a tagging rate and (b,light)→c indicates a mis-tagging rate of (b, light)-jet as c-jet.

We comment on the three types of ratios. The values in Eq. (30), used in the analysis of

Ref. [50], are highly desirable, where a rather high tagging probability and small mis-tagging ratios

are assumed. The second choice in Eq. (31) was adopted in the analysis by ATLAS to search for

a charm squark pair production at 8 TeV in Ref. [84], where the 95% CL lower bound on M˜c is
obtained at around 560 GeV assuming a massless neutralino and B(˜c → c ˜χ0
c-tagging rate is quite low compared with the ﬁrst category in Eq. (30), while the mis-tagging

1) = 100%. Here, the

probabilities are still suppressed. For identifying c-jets, the ATLAS group have developed the

algorithm named JetFitterCharm [85]. The values in the third category is also provided from

Ref. [85] through the JetFitterCharm algorithm in a diﬀerent operating point, where c-tagging

rate is emphasized but the mis-tagging rates are also enhanced, especially from light jets. Such

high mis-tag rates would lead to serious deterioration in background rejection. Later, we provide

a quantitative comparison of the impact of these three choices in our simulation.

Another important aspect on c-jets is whether at least one or at least two c-jets should be

required in our analysis. The former choice is better for earning statistics, while the latter one

deﬁnitely has better performance in background rejection. We perform analyses following both of

the criteria, the number of c-jets to be at least one or two, for a better understanding on c-jet

identiﬁcation.

After implementing the above procedure for the τh-jet and c-jets, we perform selections and cuts

to every event. It is summarized in Table V. As mentioned above, we take account of two cases for

the selection of a light lepton mode such as (A-1) (cid:96) = µ and (A-2) (cid:96) = µ, e. We also consider the

cases where the number of c-jets is required to be (B-1) at least two and (B-2) at least one. The

invariant mass between τh-jet and a chosen jet is required to be larger than 250 GeV. Which jet

is used for the invariant mass is determined as follows. The two candidates j1,2 for the jet are the

leading c-tagged jet and the most leading jet among the other jets except for the already picked-up

leading c-jet and the τh-jet. Finally, we adopt the selection cut as M (τh-jet, j1) > 250 GeV when
|M (τh-jet, j1) − M ((cid:96), j2)| < |M (τh-jet, j2) − M ((cid:96), j1)| is satisﬁed. When the above condition is
failed, we choose M (τh-jet, j2) to the selection cut. This procedure is based on Ref. [47] for the

the two jets j1,2 of the two candidates for the invariant mass calculation. The selection cut of ST
is highly eﬃcient for rejecting the irreducible t¯t background [47]. In our study, we prepare the cut

region from 100 GeV to 1000 GeV every 100 GeV step in advance and then choose an appropriate

region to maximize the signal signiﬁcance for each model parameter region.

2. Event data for signal and background

For our simulation, we generated 5×104 signal events for each mass of S1 every 50 GeV bin from
1 S1 → (cτ ) (¯c¯τ )
350 GeV to 1600 GeV, produced by MadGraph5 aMC@NLO via the process pp → S∗
accompanying up to two additional jets (to perform jet merging). As for backgrounds, 107 events
of t¯t along with up to three jets and 5 (3)× 106 events of W → (cid:96)ν(cid:96) (Z → (cid:96)¯(cid:96)) along with up to four
jets were generated for each (cid:96) = µ and e, as well. Note that the number of generated events is not
equal to the numbers of reconstruct-level events used in our cut-based analysis since O(10)% events
are discarded through the jet merging procedure. The t¯t events are dominant backgrounds since it

includes two possible miss-tagged c-jets originating from b quarks, one τh-jet, and one τ decaying

into (cid:96). The W +jets and Z+jets events give rather small contributions to the backgrounds, but

might not be negligible due to their huge cross sections and possible mis-tagged c-jets and τh-jet.

The actual values of the nominal cross sections of the three background processes are summarized

in Table VI. The pure QCD background is neglected since a charged lepton is required in the ﬁnal

state. The single top production is subleading in the original (bτ ) case [47]. Then, we ignore such

V. NUMERICAL RESULT

The detailed procedures of our analysis simulations aiming at the two processes, pp → S∗

1 S1 →
1 S1 → (cτ ) (¯c¯τ ), are presented in Sec. IV. Based on them, we obtain prospects

(bν) (¯b¯ν) and pp → S∗
for the S1 leptoquark model at the 14 TeV LHC explaining the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly.

A. Prospects of the (bν) (¯b¯ν) channel

At ﬁrst, we show the prospects of (bν)(¯b¯ν) channel at the 14 TeV LHC in Fig. 7. The two blue
solid lines indicate the exclusion limits at 95% CL, where the ﬁrst one is obtained with L = 300 fb−1
and the total uncertainty in the backgrounds σbkg used in Ref. [53], whereas the other is obtained
with L = 3000 fb−1 and σbkg = 15%, as presented in the ﬁgure. In the latter case (L = 3000 fb−1),
we expect that the background will be understood better and that σbkg = 15% is achievable. The

current observed limits from the 8 TeV searches by ATLAS and CMS, as given in Sec. III C, are

also represented in the ﬁgure. The rough estimate from the ATLAS 13 TeV analysis is given as

well.

Next, we show the prospects of the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channel as functions of MS1 and B(S∗

1 → cτ ),
based on the analysis method given in Sec. IV. As we explained, there are several possible selection

criteria for the signal events in this channel,

1. c-tagging and mis-tagging ratios: (Case-1), (Case-2), (Case-3), as in Eqs. (30)-(32),

2. requirement on the number of c-jets: (B-1) at least two, or (B-2) at least one,

3. requirement for the light lepton ﬂavor: (A-1) (cid:96) = µ, or (A-2) (cid:96) = µ or e.

respectively, which are the three choices of c-tagging/mis-tagging rates adopted in our analysis. The red

These points are very important since they directly aﬀect background rejections. So, we describe

their eﬀects at length in this subsection.

In Fig. 8, we show our numerical results for the prospects in the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channel at the 14 TeV

LHC. In this ﬁgure, we consider two cases for the integrated luminosity with the background

The left, middle, and right panels indicate the results

obtained from the diﬀerent choices of c-tagging/mis-tagging rates (Case-1), (Case-2), and (Case-

3), respectively as deﬁned in Eqs. (30)-(32). In each panel, we show two cases for the requirement

on the number of c-jets, (B-1) at least two and (B-2) at least one as denoted by red and orange

colors, respectively. The red line with dots in each plot indicates our recast bound from the 8 TeV
CMS result on (bτ )(¯b¯τ ) channel [47]. We immediately recognize the following points:

• We can rank the three choices of c-tagging/mis-tagging rates as

(Case 1) > (Case 2) (cid:29) (Case 3).

(33)

The result claims that (Case-1) works the most eﬀectively. This is deﬁnitely obvious since

this conﬁguration is a desired one; however such high c-tagging and low mis-tagging rates

may be beyond the current technology. On the other hand, the eﬃciencies of (Case-2) are

already realized and used in experiment. Although the c-tagging rate in (Case-2) is lower

than that in (Case-1), we can see that good performance is obtained in (Case-2) for our

model, similarly to (Case-1). From the upper middle panel of Fig. 8, we conclude that

we can search for the S1 leptoquark boson through the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channel up to 1.05 TeV
and 1.3 TeV, when accumulating L = 300 fb−1 of data at 14 TeV with σbkg = 30% and
L = 3000 fb−1 with σbkg = 15%, respectively. The last one, (Case-3), is insigniﬁcant because
of the high misidentiﬁcation rate, especially in light→c.

• One can ﬁnd that requiring at least two c-tagged jets, (B-1), results in the better expected
exclusion than (B-2). This is simply due to the fact that the background rejection by the

requirement of at least two c-jets is more eﬃcient than that of at least one c-jet, since the

c-jet tagging eﬃciencies are not high enough and requiring two c-jets helps us to improve

separability.

• The requirement for the light lepton to be muon (A-1), (cid:96) = µ, works well compared with (A-
2), (cid:96) = µ or e (remind that the signal region (A-2) considers both µ and e in the same signal

region). This implies that an electron channel would not signiﬁcantly improve exclusion.

In our analysis, we select events with one leptonic τ (and one hadronic τ ). Hence, the
primary background is pp → t¯t → b¯bW +W − where one of the sequential decays is W → τ ντ .
When we enlarge the allowed conﬁguration from (cid:96) = µ to (cid:96) = µ or e, both of the signal

and the primary background receive similar gains and the deterioration in the background

26

overwhelms the improvement in the signal because the nominal cross section is much greater

than that of the signal.

As a conclusion, the best choice in the requirements for the number of c-tagged jets and the light

lepton ﬂavor from the leptonic τ is (A-1) (cid:96) = µ and (B-1) at least two c-jets. Performances of the

three types of c-tagging/mis-tagging rates are investigated and graded as in Eq. (33).

C. Combined results

Here, we translate the results for the expected and current exclusion limits on the branching

ratios shown above into those on the coupling of the S1 leptoquark model, in order to declare future
prospects for probing the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly in this model. In Fig. 9, we summarize the results
for the 14 TeV LHC at 95% CL for L = 300 fb−1 of accumulated data, which present prospects for
1L and the mass MS1 from both the (bν)(¯b¯ν) and (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channels. The blue curve
the coupling g3i
shows the 95% exclusion limit from the (bν)(¯b¯ν) channel, while the red curves describe the ones

from the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channel with three diﬀerent c-tagging/mis-tagging probabilities, (Case-1,2,3) as

deﬁned in Eqs. (30)-(32) with solid, dashed, dotted curves, respectively. For the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) analysis,

(A-1) (cid:96) = µ, (B-1) at least two c-jet, and σbkg = 30% are required in this ﬁgure. The background
uncertainty for the (bν)(¯b¯ν) channel is given as in Ref. [53] (∼ 30% in high mCT signal regions),
the same as before in this paper. We also show the constraints from the 8 TeV and 13 TeV LHC
data which we discussed before. The black regions represent the areas with ΓS1/MS1 ≥ 20%,
where the narrow-width approximation is not reliable. The dark-yellow parts should be discarded

as theoretically unacceptable since perturbativity is violated for g23

1R ≥ 4π.

1L, g23

Remind that, in our setup, the couplings (g3i

1 → bν)|i=1 or 2, B(S∗

1 → cτ )|i=3 < B(S∗

(34)

Thus, the coverage of the 95% exclusion contour from the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channel tends to be broader in
i = 1 or 2 compared with i = 3, while the opposite trend is found in the contour from the (bν)(¯b¯ν)

channel. The eﬃciencies of the three c-tagging/mis-tagging rates in the Case-1, 2, 3 are directly

reﬂected in the explored ranges as following the order in Eq. (33). Through the cooperation of the

1L and the mass MS1 from both the (bν)(¯b¯ν) and (cτ )(¯c¯τ )
present 95% CL exclusions for the coupling g3i
channels. The blue curve shows the 95% exclusion limit from the (bν)(¯b¯ν) channel, while the red curves

describe the ones from the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channel, where the three diﬀerent c-tagging/mis-tagging probabilities

SUMMARY

We have investigated the LHC potential to probe the S1 leptoquark model that can explain
the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly in light of existing LHC results at 8 and 13 TeV, and provided expected
exclusion bounds and discovery reach at the 14 TeV LHC in terms of the parameters of this model.
At ﬁrst, we have brieﬂy reviewed the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly, expressed in terms of the deviations
of the observables R(D) and R(D∗) between the current combined experimental results and the

SM predictions. It turns out that current results exhibit a deviation with signiﬁcance of around

4σ. The previous studies in Refs. [10, 16, 27, 28] suggest that the deviations can be explained by

several leptoquark models. Based on Ref. [10], we have provided the latest allowed ranges for the

couplings in the leptoquark models. Then we have seen that three types of leptoquark bosons, S1,

R2, and U1 can explain the anomaly while being consistent with all other ﬂavor constraints.

Among them, we have focused on the S1 leptoquark boson in order to study the LHC potential
to probe the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly. In order to explain the anomaly, the minimal setup yields

Several existing 8 TeV LHC searches can be used to constrain our model. We have translated

˜b1 → b(cid:101)χ0

the results of ATLAS and CMS searches for pair-produced bottom squarks [42, 43] decaying as

1 into constraints for the S1 boson. A direct bound on the scalar leptoquark boson from
(bν)(¯b¯ν) was also provided by ATLAS [44]. Moreover, we have considered the constraints from

the CMS search [46] for third-generation scalar leptoquark bosons decaying into (tτ )(¯t¯τ ). We
have estimated the current bound on (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) by recasting the leptoquark search for the (bτ )(¯b¯τ )

channel in Ref. [47]. This recasting is based on our study for the tagging and mis-tagging eﬃciencies

between b and c quarks, with the help of Refs. [51, 52]. Finally, preliminary results of the search

for bottom squarks at the 13 TeV LHC were also taken into account. In summary, the constraints

from the current available LHC searches at 8 TeV imply that MS1 < 400 GeV, MS1 < 530 GeV,
(cid:46) 0.2, respectively. We reach a

) in the SUSY model, as was already reported

As for the cut analysis in the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channel, we have employed the method for (bτ )(¯b¯τ )

given by CMS [47] and tuned it to the 14 TeV LHC study for the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) signal. The following

three important topics were discussed: (A) the requirement for the light lepton ﬂavor, (B) the

requirement on the number of c-jets, and (C) the c-tagging rates. In the given method, one of the

tau-leptons is identiﬁed by the light lepton (cid:96) through the decay. In our analysis, we have considered
the two cases as (A-1) (cid:96) = µ and (A-2) (cid:96) = µ or e. The original method for (bτ )(¯b¯τ ) suggests that

only one of the quark ﬂavors (b) is tagged in the analysis. Instead, we have considered the two

cases such that (B-1) at least two c-jets and (B-2) at least one c-jet are tagged in our analysis for

(cτ )(¯c¯τ ). Finally we have studied the three possibilities for the c-tagging/mis-tagging rates such

as (Case-1) from Ref. [50], (Case-2) from Ref. [84], and (Case-3) from Ref. [85], since the eﬃciency

of the c-tagging algorithms at 14 TeV is not yet known.

After implementing the above method, we have generated and analyzed the signal events in the
1 S1 → (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) with the use of MadGraph5 aCM@NLO,
processes pp → S∗
pythia-pgs, DelphesMA5tune, and MadAnalsysis5 in the cluster system provided at CTPU-IBS.

1 S1 → (bν)(¯b¯ν) and pp → S∗

Then we have ﬁnally obtained the exclusion limits on the S1 leptoquark boson, expected at the
14 TeV LHC when L = 300 fb−1 of data is accumulated. Our results suggest that the S1 leptoquark
boson up to at least 0.8 TeV mass can be excluded at 95% CL for both i = 3 and i = 1 or 2 cases

searches, respectively. We have also evaluated the 95% CL exclusion and 5σ discovery potentials
at a future 14 TeV center-of-mass energy, assuming that L = 3000 fb−1 of data is collected and
the background uncertainty is improved as σbkg = 15%. The 95% CL excluded ranges of MS1 are
changed as 1.0 TeV ∼ 1.3 TeV. It has been found that the S1 leptoquark boson with mass less
than 0.8 TeV can be discovered from both the (bν)(¯b¯ν) and (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) channels. A discovery only
(cid:46) 1.1 TeV. We emphasize
from either the (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) or (bν)(¯b¯ν) search can be expected up to MS1
that the ¯B → D(∗)τ ¯ν anomaly, explained by the S1 leptoquark boson, can be probed at the LHC
search only if both the signals from (bν)(¯b¯ν) and (cτ )(¯c¯τ ) are discovered.

Finally, we mention that the leptoquark study in this paper is a simpliﬁed one, where only two

leptoquark couplings to the second and third generation fermions are nonzero, and the SU (2)L

singlet S1 leptoquark boson is chosen for simplicity. In this model, however, nonzero proton decay

amplitudes are written down with renormalizable interactions in general, even though the proton

decay is problematic only in the presence of nonzero couplings to the ﬁrst generation fermions. A

31

more realistic candidate would be the doublet leptoquark R2, where proton decay does not occur

at the renormalizable level. An exhaustive study including detailed collider analyses on R2 would

be an interesting further direction.

Appendix A: Experimental results of R(D) and R(D∗)

The present experimental results from the BaBar experiment [1, 2] have been given by

R(D)BaBar = 0.440 ± 0.072 , R(D∗)BaBar = 0.332 ± 0.030 ,

(A1)

where their correlation is reported as ρBaBar = −0.27. The recent results reported from the Belle [8]
and LHCb [9] collaborations are shown as

R(D)Belle = 0.375 ± 0.069 , R(D∗)Belle = 0.293 ± 0.041 ,
R(D∗)LHCb = 0.336 ± 0.040 .

ρBelle = −0.36 ,

(A2)

(A3)

Then we obtained the combined results as

R(D)exp = 0.393 ± 0.048 , R(D∗)exp = 0.321 ± 0.021 ,

ρexp = −0.31 .

(A4)

With using this, we have evaluated the deviations as in Eqs. (2) and (3) and plotted the contour

as in Fig. 1.

We now brieﬂy explain the way in which the observables R(D) and R(D∗), deﬁned in Eq. (1),

are measured. The BaBar collaboration [1] reconstructed only the purely leptonic decays of the
tau lepton such as τ− → e− ¯νeντ and τ− → µ− ¯νµντ , so that the signal ( ¯B → D(∗)τ− ¯ντ ) and the
normalization ( ¯B → D(∗)(cid:96)− ¯ν(cid:96) for (cid:96) = e and µ) events can be identiﬁed using the same particles

32

in the detector. Then signal and normalization events are extracted after several parameter ﬁts to

distributions are performed. This method can reduce various sources of uncertainty in R(D) and
R(D∗). The recent Belle result in Ref. [8] was also improved in a similar way. The analysis for

the LHCb is totally diﬀerent [9] since the B mesons are produced from the proton-proton collision.

The muonic tau decay mode is utilized at LHCb.

As for the normalization modes ¯B → D(∗)(cid:96)− ¯ν(cid:96), the averaged decay rates for (cid:96) = e and µ are used
for the theoretical predictions on R(D(∗)). These decay processes have been observed to measure
|Vcb| in Refs. [92–95]. We note that diﬀerences between the results from (cid:96) = e and µ decay modes
are not seen in the determination of |Vcb|, which implies that the lepton ﬂavor universality between
¯B → D(∗)e− ¯νe and ¯B → D(∗)µ− ¯νµ holds within uncertainties.

Appendix B: Misidentiﬁed signals

In our main study, we focused on the (bν)(¯b¯ν) and (cτ ) (¯c¯τ ) channels as signal events in the

search. As introduced in Sec. V C, misidentiﬁed signals, arising from other leptoquark processes

than the ones primarily considered, may arise and should be discussed. In particular, the processes
1 S1 → (cτ )(¯t¯τ ), (tτ )(¯c¯τ ) are dominant misidentiﬁed signals in our model.

1 → cτ . We have investigated such misidentiﬁed
They can contribute to the signal in the search for S∗
signals and evaluated their exclusion potential in the (MS1, g33
1L) plane of the S1 leptoquark model.
In Fig. 11, we show the 95% exclusion limits from the signal through the misidentiﬁcation of
(cτ )(¯t¯τ ), (tτ )(¯c¯τ ) and (tτ )(¯t¯τ ), where we set L = 300 fb−1, σbkg = 30%, (A-1), and (B-1). The
black curves indicate the 95% exclusion limits from the misidentiﬁed signals of [(cτ )(¯t¯τ ), (tτ )(¯c¯τ )]

and [(tτ )(¯t¯τ )] presented in the left and right panels, respectively. The solid and dashed curves are

obtained for Case-1 and Case-2, respectively. The blue and red curves are the results from the
normal signals (bν)(¯b¯ν) and (cτ ) (¯c¯τ ) (for Case-1 and Case-2), as shown in Sec. V.

Although the misidentiﬁcation of the (cτ )(¯t¯τ ), (tτ )(¯c¯τ ), and (tτ )(¯t¯τ ) channels aﬀect the evalu-
ation of expected exclusion limits, it turns out that our conclusion obtained from the (bν)(¯b¯ν) and

(cτ ) (¯c¯τ ) analyses is not improved signiﬁcantly when the misidentiﬁcations are taken into account.

This is because that the excluded regions from these misidentiﬁed signals are fully covered by those
from the original signals. The other possible misidentiﬁed signals such as (cτ )(¯b¯ν) are vetoed in

the cut analysis.

Misidentiﬁcations for the signal (bν)(¯b¯ν) can also occur. The processes (tτ )(¯b¯ν), (bν)(¯t¯τ ),
(cτ )(¯b¯ν), (bν)(¯c¯τ ) are candidates for the misidentiﬁed signals. We have also studied these sig-
