The mammalian hippocampus plays a principal role in producing a cognitive map of space—an
internalized representation of the animal’s environment. The neuronal mechanisms producing this
map depend primarily on the temporal structure of the hippocampal neurons’ spiking activity, which
is modulated by the oscillatory extracellular electrical ﬁeld potential. In this paper, we discuss the
integrative eﬀect of the gamma rhythm, one of the principal components of these oscillations, on
the ability of the place cell ensembles to encode a spatial map. Using methods of algebraic topol-
ogy and statistical physics, we demonstrate that gamma-modulation of neuronal activity generates
a synchronized spiking of dynamical cell assemblies, which enables learning a spatial map at faster
timescales.

INTRODUCTION

2

The mammalian hippocampus plays a key role in spatial cognition. Place cells, the principal hippocam-
pal neurons, manifest remarkable spatial speciﬁcity of spiking activity. They ﬁre only in select locations
in the environment. These locations are known as their respective place ﬁelds [1]. As a result, the place
cells’ spike trains contain information about the animal’s current location [2], its future [3] and past [4]
navigation routes, both in the wakeful state and even in sleep [5]. Moreover, damages to the hippocampal
network produce impairments in spatial learning and diﬃculties in navigation planning [6, 7]. It is hence
believed that the place cell ensembles encode an internalized “map” that serves as a basis of animal’s spatial
awareness [8, 9].

Motivation. An increasing amount of both direct [10–14] and indirect [15–19] experimental evidence
suggests that this map is topological in nature, a rough-and-ready connectivity framework into which other
brain regions integrate more detailed metrical information. A number of approaches have been deployed
to understand the neuronal computations that could produce such a framework [20–29]. In particular, the
approach proposed in [22–24] exploits the connection between the place ﬁelds covering an environment
and the Alexandrov- ˇCech theorem, which points out the possibility of reconstructing the topology of a
space X from the pattern of overlaps between regions that cover X. The fact that the place ﬁelds produce
a dense cover of the environment suggests that the pattern of overlaps between them contains the infor-
mation required to represent the environment’s topology, which may hold the key to the way in which the
hippocampus encodes its topological map of s pace. This observation is taken further by noticing that the
domains where several place ﬁelds overlap are precisely the ones where the corresponding place cells coﬁre.
In other words, the information about the overlap of place ﬁelds is represented via the place cell coactivity,
which suggests that the Alexandrov- ˇCech construction can be carried out not only via geometric pattern of
the place ﬁeld overlaps, but also through the analysis of the place cell coactivities.

Topological model. The details of the topological model of the hippocampal map are discussed in
[23, 24], but in brief, the idea is to represent the combinations of coactive place cells (c1, c2, ..., cp) as
multi-dimensional polyhedra—the “coactivity simplexes,” σ = [c1, c2, ..., cp] (see Methods). Together,
these coactivity simplexes form a simplicial “coactivity complex” Tσ. In his construction, the individual
cell groups, just like simplexes, provide local information about the space; joined together into a simplicial
complex, modeling a neuronal ensemble, they represent space as whole. Numerical simulations demonstrate
that Tσ captures the topological structure of the environment and serves as a schematic representation of
the hippocampal map [23, 29]. For example, the sequences of place cell combinations ignited along the
paths traversed by the animal are represented in Tσ by chains of coactivity simplexes—the simplicial paths
[30, 31]. A non-contractible simplicial path may represent a navigational path γ that encircles a physical
obstacle, whereas topologically trivial simplicial paths correspond to contractible routes in the physical
space (Figure 1A,B).
The complex Tσ begins to form as soon as the rat starts navigating. Every detected instance of place cell
coactivity contributes a simplex to Tσ. At the early stages of navigation, when only a few cells had time
to produce spikes, the coactivity complex is small, fragmented, and contains many holes, most of which do
not represent physical obstacles in the environment. Such holes, which may be viewed as transient “gaps”
in the cognitive map, tend to disappear as spatial learning continues. The minimal time, Tmin, after which
the topology of Tσ matches the topology of the environment, or more precisely, when the correct number of
topological loops emerges, Figure 1C, can therefore be viewed as a theoretical estimate of the time required
to learn the hippocampal map [23, 24].
Parameter dependence. An important property of the model is that the structure of the coactivity
complex Tσ and the time course of its formation during learning are sensitive to various parameters of
the neuronal ﬁring statistics, which allows studying the net eﬀect produced by these parameters on spatial
learning. For example, the oscillations of the extracellular electrical ﬁeld potential, typically referred to as
the local ﬁeld potential (LFP), are known to modulate the place cells’ activity at several timescales. First,

FIG. 1: Paths in the environment are represented in a simplicial complex. (A) Two topologically equivalent
paths in a physical environment, γ1 and γ2, encircle an obstacle (white square) that cannot traversed by the rat’s
trajectory (grey curve in the background) and are therefore non-contractible. The path γ3 does not encircle the obstacle
and therefore is contractible and topologically inequivalent to γ1 and γ2. (B) A schematic representation of the 2D
skeleton of the coactivity complex Tσ (vertices shown as black dots, the 1D links as white lines and 2D facets as
grey triangles) and of the simplicial paths Γ1, Γ2 and Γ3, which represent the physical paths γ1, γ2 and γ3. The
topological equivalences and inequivalences between the simplicial paths (Γ1 (cid:27) Γ2 and Γ1 (cid:29) Γ3, Γ2 (cid:29) Γ3) provide
qualitative information about the physical paths, encoded via place cell coactivity. Since we are primarily concerned
with representing topological properties of the navigational paths, in the following we discuss only the 2D skeleton
of the coactivity complex. (C) Timelines of the topological loops encoded in the coactivity complex. As the animal
begins to explore its environment, the coactivity complex contains many spurious topological loops most of which
do not represent the physical obstacle. This “topological noise” disappears after about ﬁve minutes, which marks the
learning time, Tmin—the moment when the correct topology of space (one 1D loop representing the obstacle and one
0D loop that informs us that the environment is connected) has emerged.

each place cell tends to spike within a small range of the phases of the “theta” component of the LFP (θ, 4-12
Hz [32]), which depends on the distance that the animal has traveled into the corresponding place ﬁeld. As
a rat moves through the place ﬁeld, the preferred θ-range of a place cell progressively decreases with each
new θ-cycle, a phenomenon known as the θ-phase precession [33]. The preferred θ-phases of diﬀerent cells
are additionally synchronized by the second major component of the LFP, the “gamma” rhythm (γ, 30-80
Hz, [34]). In fact, the period of the more rapid γ-rhythm, Tγ, is believed to deﬁne the range of the preferred
phases within the slower θ-rhythm; on average a θ-period, Tθ, contains about seven γ-cycles, Tθ ≈ 7Tγ (see
[35] and Figure S1A).

Numerous experimental [36–40] and theoretical [35, 41–44] studies demonstrate that both the θ- and
the γ-waves play key roles in spatial, working, and episodic memory functions. However, most theoretical
analyses addressed the way in which the γ-synchronization aﬀects the informational contents of spiking in
small networks or in the individual cells. In contrast, the topological approach allows modeling cognitive
map as a whole. For example, it was used in [24] to demonstrate that θ-precession makes otherwise poorly
performing ensembles more capable of spatial learning.

The present analysis applies the topological model to study the eﬀect produced on spatial learning by the
γ-waves and to demonstrate that γ-synchronization of the place cell spiking activity enables the encoding
or retrieval of the large-scale spatial representations of the environment by integrating place cell coactivity
at a synaptic timescale.

II. THE MODEL

Computational modeling of the θ-phase precession is relatively straightforward: at the basic level, it
amounts to imposing a particular relationship between a place cell’s spiking probability, the phase of the

4

FIG. 2: Gamma synchronization. (A) Without coupling with the γ-wave (β = 0, top panel) the simulated place cell
spikes are diﬀusely scattered over the time axis. The temporal spread of the place cell coactivity is about a couple of
θ-periods, ∆0 ≈ 1.5Tθ, Tθ ≈ 125 msec. At β = 1, the intervals of place cell coactivity concentrate near domains of
high γ-amplitude, ∆1 ≈ 0.5Tθ. At β = 2, the spikes accumulate near the γ-troughs, ∆2 ≈ Tγ, thus producing dynamical
cell assemblies (bottom panel). (B) The statistics of interspike intervals (ISI) for diﬀerent βs. The black dashed line
shows the distribution of the time intervals between deep γ-troughs (deeper than two standard deviations of A(t) from
the mean). As β increases, the intervals between spikes are more controlled by the deep troughs (where the amplitude
exceeds three standard deviations of A(t) above the mean). Note, that the tendency of spikes produced by the same
place cell to appear within the same γ-cycle can be viewed as a basic model of bursting [49].

θ-wave and the distance that the animal has traveled into a corresponding place ﬁeld [45] (see Methods).
However, the eﬀects of the γ-rhythm are more diverse. Electrophysiological experiments suggest that there
exist at least two types of place cells: the “TroPyr” cells that spike at the trough of the fast γ-wave (50-80
Hz) and the “RisPyr” cells that ﬁre at the raising phase of slow γ-waves, overriding θ-precession [46–48].
Although our approach allows modeling both cell types (see Methods), in the following we will model only
the TroPyr cells that exhibit more robust ﬁring patterns and higher ﬁring rates, and therefore may play a
primary role in producing the cognitive map [23, 24].

γ-modulation of spiking. Physiologically, the γ-wave represents fast oscillations of the inhibitory post-
synaptic potentials. As the amplitude of γ drops at a certain location, the surrounding cells with high
membrane potential spike [50–52]. As a result, the preferred θ-phase of several cells becomes synchro-
nized with a γ-trough, which thereby gates the place cell coactivity. The literature refers to such groups of
coactive place cells as “dynamic cell assemblies” (see [57–59]and Figure S1A).

Modeling γ-modulation therefore requires adjusting the times of the θ-modulated spikes closer to the
troughs of the γ-wave [54]. Algorithmically, this task is similar to the task of distributing stochastic particles
over the wells of a 1D potential energy ﬁeld, which is solved based on the Maximum Entropy Principle
[55]. The probability that a particle lands at point x in a potential U(x) is p ∼ e−βU(x), where the parameter
β controls the spread of the locations around the minima of U(x). In statistical physics, this parameter
is interpreted as the inverse temperature. Higher values of β, meaning lower temperatures, imply that the
particles are more conﬁned to the bottoms of the wells (Figure S1B).
Viewing the γ-amplitude, Aγ(t), as an inhibitory potential extended over the time axis, we conﬁned the
place cells’ ﬁring to the troughs of the γ-wave by modulating their ﬁring rates with the factor e−βγAγ(t). Thus,
the parameter βγ controls the temporal spread ∆β of spikes produced by the dynamical cell assemblies. For
small βγ, the cell assemblies are “hot,” meaning their spikes are spread diﬀusely near the γ-troughs. For
large βγ the assemblies are “cold,” their spikes “freeze” at the γ-troughs (Figure 2 and Figure S2).
In
particular, the case in which the spike trains are uncorrelated with the γ-troughs corresponds to the limiting
case of an “inﬁnitely hot” (βγ = 0) hippocampus, modeled in [24].

To our knowledge, the statistics of the temporal spreads of the spikes produced by the dynamical cell

5

assemblies have not been studied. However, neurophysiological literature suggests that a typical spread
is about one γ-period (∆ ≈ Tγ ≈ 20 msec) [56–59], which implies that the eﬀective temperature of the
hippocampal cell assemblies is comparable to the mean γ-trough amplitude 1/βγ ≈ ¯Atr (see Methods).
In the following discussion, it will be convenient to scale the amplitude of the γ-wave with its standard
deviation from the mean, σγ, Aγ(t) → A(t) = Aγ(t)/σγ. In turn, this entails the corresponding scaling of the
inverse temperature, yielding a parameter β = βγσγ with the “physiological” range between 0.5 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 2.

Reading out place cell coactivities. The spiking signals produced by the place cells are transmitted
In the reader-centric approach
to a population of readout neurons downstream from the hippocampus.
to information processing in the hippocampal network [29, 58], these neurons play a deﬁning role. An
assembly σ is viewed not simply as an arbitrary combination of coactive place cells but as a functionally
interconnected cell group that jointly triggers a spiking response from a certain readout neuron nσ. In turn,
the readout neuron nσ spikes upon receiving a suﬃcient amount of timed EPSP inputs over a certain period
wσ, the “integration window” [60–62]. This is the only parameter that describes the readout neurons in the
following discussion. Clearly, diﬀerent readout neurons may integrate inputs over diﬀerent time intervals.
However, in order to simplify the present approach, we will describe the entire population of the readout
neurons using a single parameter wσ = w, viewed as the average time over which a typical readout neuron
accumulates EPSP inputs [24].

θ and γ synchronicity.

In our previous study [24], we modeled assemblies of independently θ-
precessing place cells simply as combinations of neurons that happened to produce spikes within a certain
w-period. The model predicted that the spatial maps are built reliably if the coactivity inputs are identiﬁed
over the θ-timescale (Tθ (cid:46) w (cid:46) 2Tθ). However, as w shrinks, the chance of producing and detecting the
coactivities within a w-period diminishes, and the topological map takes longer to form. For the intermedi-
ate range of values (3Tγ (cid:46) w (cid:46) 3Tθ), the learning time is approximately inversely proportional to w, but as
w reduces to the γ-period, the pool of detected place cell coactivities often fails to capture the topological
structure of the environment or requires a much longer time to produce it, exhibiting high variability of Tmin
upon w. Moreover, experimental studies have shown that the synchronicity of the place cell assemblies is
best manifested precisely at the γ-timescale [57–59]. This implies that the hippocampal network is capable
of producing large-scale spatial maps based on the γ-timescale readouts. Therefore, we hypothesized that
the failure of the previous (θ-driven) topological model to do that may be due to poorer synchronization in
the assemblies of independent neurons driven by common θ-pacemaker, rather than to the physiological cell
assemblies that are additionally synchronized through synaptic interactions [63].

In the present analysis, we use the eﬀective temperature 1/β to describe phenomenologically these addi-
tional synchronization mechanisms. As illustrated in Figure 2, the parameter β controls the temporal spread
of the spiking activity in cell assemblies, ∆β, independently from w and allows transitioning from desyn-
chronized cell assemblies to the cell assemblies that are tightly coupled with γ-troughs. The results shown in
Figure 2 also suggest that binding the coactivity of place cell assemblies within γ-periods (∆2 ≈ Tγ) should
signiﬁcantly reduce the time required by the downstream networks to detect place cell coactivity. Thus, γ-
synchronization may enable us to construct a reliable neuronal representation of space using the γ-timescale
readout, w ≈ Tγ, which would provide a direct demonstration of the importance of the γ-synchronization at
the systemic level.

III. RESULTS

To describe the eﬀects of the γ-waves on the ability of place cells to encode spatial information, we built
the coactivity complex using γ-modulated spike trains for diﬀerent βs and studied its topological properties
for a set of ws, including the values for which the independently θ-precessing place cells fail to produce
correct topological maps. The results shown on Figure 3 demonstrate that, at large integration windows
(w ≥ Tθ, fat lines), tightening the cell assemblies around the γ-troughs does not produce a signiﬁcant eﬀect

readout neurons.. There are two major parameters of the model: the mean width of the temporal window w over
which the postsynaptic readout neurons integrate spiking inputs from the place cell assemblies (w1 = 2Tθ, w2 = 1.2Tθ,
w3 = 0.8Tθ, w4 = 0.5Tθ, w5 = 0.3Tθ, w6 = 0.2Tθ, represented by the thickness of the line), and the eﬀective
temperature 1/β which controls the clustering of place cells’ spikes around the troughs of the γ-wave (Figure 2).
Larger values of β (indicated by the blue color of the colormap) correspond to tighter coupling between the place
cell’s spiking probability and the γ-amplitude (Figure S1). (A) The number of 2D simplexes, N2, in the coactivity
complex Tσ as a function of β, for diﬀerent ws. For large integration windows (thicker lines), coupling with γ-wave
does not produce signiﬁcant eﬀect: the N2 changes less along the β-axis. As w decreases, the number of simplexes
drops (the thinner lines lay below the thicker ones). However, the smaller is w, the more increase of the number
of coactive place cell combination is produced by the cooling of the cell assemblies: for w = Tγ (top curve) the
number of 2D simplexes grows by 40% as β goes from 0 to 2. (B) Shrinking the integration window w increases the
total number of topological loops observed in Tσ during the course of learning, whereas cooling down the coactivity
complex reduces this number. For example, the number of cold loops (β = 2) at w = Tγ is about 50% of the number
hot loops (β = 0). (C) The learning time Tmin grows as w shrinks and tends to decrease as a function of β. Note
however, even cold simplicial complexes fail to produce the correct topological maps for small ws. In the particular
map illustrated here (mean place ﬁeld size s = 24 cm, mean ﬁring rate f = 20 Hz, Nc = 450 cells), learning time
diverges at w ≥ 0.5Tθ.

on either the structure of Tσ or on the times required to learn the map Tmin. This outcome is easy to
explain: if the readout neurons accumulate EPSPs at the θ-timescale, i.e., over hundreds of milliseconds,
the temporal arrangement of the spikes at the γ-timescale does not change the combinations of coactive
place cell detected downstream. In other words, no matter how the γ-tuned spikes are spread inside a θ-
wide window w, the coactivity simplexes, and hence the coactivity complex, remain the same, yielding the
same topological information after the same learning period. As w decreases, the temporal spread of the
poorly synchronized, “hot” place cell assemblies begins to exceed w. As a result, only a fraction of the
coactive cells can be detected downstream, which leads to a decrease of the number of simplexes in Tσ and
to a proliferation of spurious topological loops during the learning period. Moreover, many of these loops
persist indeﬁnitely, preventing the appearance of the correct topological information even at the intermediate
values of w (Figure 3C).

In contrast, the behavior of the “cold” cell assemblies (β > 1, the blue ends of the graphs) is diﬀerent.
First, the number of 2D simplexes raises with cooling, which reﬂects the fact that the size of the cell
assemblies increases with increasing β (Figure 3A). Second, colder coactivity complexes Tσ yield fewer,
faster contracting spurious loops (Figure 3B and Figure S3). Third, the learning times drop signiﬁcantly:
for β = 2, the Tmin computed for w = 0.5Tθ reduce by about 50% compared to the desynchronized, β =
0 case, which indicates that γ-synchronization allows building a topological map based on the coactivity
information transmitted to the downstream networks at times shorter than one γ-cycle (Figure 3C and Figure
S4).

Nevertheless, the results shown on Figure 3 typically do not extend to the γ-timescale of w. The inputs
collected from the cell assemblies which cooled to the physiological range of βs (0.5 (cid:46) β (cid:46) 2) at w < 0.3Tθ
often failed to produce an accurate map of the environment. This suggests that producing a correct neuronal

readout neurons: clique complexes. (A) The dependence of the number of triple connections in the clique coactivity
complex Tς is similar to the dependence of number of 2D simplexes in the simplicial coactivity complex. As the
integration window decreases (same range of ws as on Figure 3), the number of triple connections drops. Cooling
down the assemblies does not produce signiﬁcant eﬀect at large integration windows, but increases the number of
triple connections for small ws (by about 25% for w ≈ Tγ). (B) The total number of topological loops observed in
the clique coactivity complex Tς is reduced with cooling for small ws, similarly to the case of the ˇCech coactivity
complex. At the γ-timescale, w ≈ Tγ, the tendency of the shrinking ws to produce large numbers of topological loops
in the clique coactivity complex is nearly compensated by cooling down Tς: the number of cold loops (β = 2) in Tς is
, and Nς
about 50% of the number hot loops (β = 0). Note that despite similar qualitative behaviors, the scales of Nσ

are diﬀerent: the clique complex produces fewer spurious loops than the simplicial complex. (C) The learning times
grow as a function of w; however, for the clique complex they remain ﬁnite even for w ≈ Tγ. Thus, the cooler the
ensemble of cell assemblies, the faster it learns, especially for small w.

map of space within a biologically plausible learning time using w ≈ Tγ requires further cooling of Tσ (by
increasing β indeﬁnitely, the cell assemblies can be made as tight as desired). Thus, in order to keep the
parameter β within the physiological range, we have deployed an alternative approach.
Clique coactivity complexes. In the above discussion, the central construction of the model, which
is the ˇCech coactivity complex Tσ, was introduced as a schematic representation of the place ﬁeld map
[29]. However, as shown in [64, 65], a coactivity complex can be built not only by detecting higher order
coactivity events that directly mark the locations were several place ﬁeld overlap, but also by integrating
the information provided by the lower order place cell coactivities. Physiologically, the latter option cor-
responds to the cell assembly network in which the readout neurons integrate lower order coactivity inputs
over a working memory timescale, rather than merely react to coactivities as all-or-none coactivity detectors
[66, 67].

To model a network of cell assemblies driving a population of input-integrator readout neurons, we used
the following approach. First, we detected the lowest order, pairwise place cell coactivities and used them
to build a connectivity graph G (see [64] and Figure S5). Then the maximal cliques of G (see Methods)
were identiﬁed with the maximal simplexes of a new “clique” coactivity complex Tς. A key property
of this algorithm is that the connections constituting a clique or a simplex do not have to be detected at
once—instead, they can be accumulated over an extended period. For physiological accuracy, we restrict
this period to 10 mins or less, which results in a coactivity complex whose simplexes, or a cell assembly
network whose cell assemblies, emerge over working memory intervals.

Although the algorithm of constructing temporal ˇCech and the clique complexes seem quite diﬀerent, the
actual diﬀerence between these two coactivity complexes is not as signiﬁcant. First, as shown in [29, 64],
most simplexes of Tς correspond to the simplexes of Tσ and vice versa (i.e., the identities of the cell
assemblies are largely the same, only the time course of their construction changes) and the topological
structures of these complexes are quite close. Second, most pairwise connections within the cliques of G
are produced almost simultaneously while the rat traverses the region where several place ﬁelds overlap. In
other words, most cliques appear at once, just as the simplexes do, and only a relatively small number of the

8

maximal cliques are actually “corrected” over time [65]. Nevertheless, this eﬀect does improve the overall
performance of the clique coactivity complexes, which typically produce much smaller numbers of spurious
topological loops. This corresponds to a shorter learning times Tmin than the ˇCech coactivity complexes.

Implementing the γ-synchronization mechanism in an integrator model yields the results illustrated in
Figure 4. First, the structure of the graphs on Figures 3A and Figure 4A is qualitatively similar, though the
pool of the third order cliques comes out to be slightly larger than the pool of 2D simplexes. This is because
not every clique makes a simultaneous appearance as a simplex, but every simplex can be viewed as an
instantly detected clique. The behaviors of the topological loops in Tς and in Tσ, shown in Figures 3B and
Figure 4B are similar as well: the γ-synchronization reduces the number of the cold spurious loops in both
types of complexes (Figure S6). Physiologically, this implies that γ-rhythm produces the same organizing
eﬀect on the activity of cell assembly network, whether the latter is based coincidence detector or on the
input integrator readout neurons. However, it should be noted that, for all βs, the number of loops in Tς is
smaller than in Tσ by an order of magnitude, which illustrates the eﬃciency of the input integrating readout
neurons. Most importantly, the integrator complex Tς produces ﬁnite learning times at the γ-timescale
integration window, w ≈ Tγ, which demonstrates that the hippocampal network can produce a spatial
memory map by reading out γ-synchronized place cell coactivity at the γ-timescale and accumulating them
over working memory timescale, and the model provides a simple phenomenological mechanism for this
demonstration.

IV. DISCUSSION

The neuronal activity is synchronized across the hippocampal network, giving rise to rhythmic ﬂows of
synaptic currents. The resulting waves of the mean extracellular ﬁeld deﬁne the timescales of the place cell
(co)activity and hence control the “parcellation” of the information ﬂow which is received by downstream
networks. In particular, the synchronization of the processes taking place at the synaptic timescale, such as
the processes controlled by the membrane time constant, by the duration of receptor-mediated postsynaptic
spike potentials, by the rate of spike-timing dependent plasticity and so forth ([68–70]) is manifested at the
network level as γ-frequency oscillations [71–75]. Processes that involve slower forms of synaptic plasticity,
including slow changing spiking thresholds [76–79], synchronize at the timescales of θ-frequencies. As a
result, θ-oscillations provide lower resolution temporal packaging of place cell coactivity [63, 80, 81], which
allows integrating spiking inputs from several cell assemblies over one or more θ-periods [82–84].

The topological model based on independently θ-precessing place cells provides a self-consistent de-
scription of the hippocampal network’s function at the θ-timescale, predicting, in particular, an optimal
integration window for reading out the information within the θ-range [24]. However, as the integration
window becomes smaller, the spatial map encoded by independently precessing place cells fails to repre-
sent spatial maps, indicating the importance of additional synchronization at the γ-timescale and suggesting
that further reﬁnement of the model is required.

The phenomenological model proposed above is based on the assumption that the γ-rhythm controls
not only the probability of the cell assemblies’ spiking but also deﬁnes the temporal spread of the spikes
produced by the cell assemblies around the troughs of the γ-wave. As a result, the model predicts that if the
preferred θ-phases synchronize with the γ-troughs, the topological map of space can be robustly captured
by integrating the place cell coactivity at the γ-timescale. Thus, γ-synchronization of spiking activity is
crucial for encoding and reading out the large scale information by acquiring the information from the cell
assembly inputs arriving in “γ-packets” [58].

Second, the model can explain why a suppression of the γ-wave amplitude, induced by the changes in
network’s synaptic physiology [85–89], or produced by psychoactive drugs [90] such as cocaine [91, 92], or
arising due to neurodegeneration or aging [93, 94], usually correlates with impairments in learning. Lastly,
these results may also explain the well-known correlation between successful learning and retrieval of the

9

learned information with the increase of the γ-amplitude in raised attention states [95–99].

cells. Note that the subsets of the set σd form subsimplexes of σd and that a nonempty overlap of any

simplexes. The elements of a simplex σd can be visualized as vertices of d-dimensional polytopes: σ0 can
be visualized as a point, σ1 as the ends of a line segment, σ2 as the vertices of a triangle, σ3 as the vertices
of a tetrahedron, etc. [100]. A clique in a graph G is a set of fully interconnected vertices (i.e., a complete
graph). Combinatorically, cliques have the same key properties as the abstract simplexes: any subcollection
of vertices in a clique is fully interconnected, and hence forms a subclique. A nonempty overlap of two

collection of cliques in a graph G deﬁnes a clique simplicial complex Σς(G).

Choice of the simulated environment. In [24] we showed that the time required to learn a large spatial
environment is approximately equal to sum of times required to learn its parts. We therefore simulated a
non-preferential exploratory behavior in a small planar environment (1m × 1m) shown in Figure 1A, which
is similar to the ones used in electrophysiological experiments [101].

The Poisson spiking rate of a place cell c at a point r(t) = (x(t), y(t)) is given by

λc(r) = fce

− (r−rc)2
2s2
c

where fc is the maximal ﬁring rate and sc deﬁnes the size of the place ﬁeld centered at rc = (xc, yc). The set
of scs and fcs in an ensemble of N place cells are lognormally distributed around a certain ensemble-mean
ﬁring rate, f and a certain ensemble-mean place ﬁeld size s, with the variances σ f = a f and σs = bs
respectively, i.e., a place cell ensemble is described by a triple of parameters: (s, f, N) [23].

θ-phase precession. As the rat moves over a distance l(t) into the place ﬁeld of a cell c, the preferred

spiking phase is

ϕθ,c(t) ≈ 2π(1 − l(t)/Lc),

where Lc ∼ 3sc is the size of the place ﬁeld [33, 102]. To simulate the coupling between the ﬁring rate and
the θ-phase, we modulated the original Gaussian ﬁring rate by a θ-factor Λθ,c(ϕ), giving

Λθ,c(ϕ) = e

− (ϕ−ϕθ,c(t))2

2ε2
c

,

using the θ-component of the LFP recorded in wild type mice. The width, ε, of the Gaussian was deﬁned
in [24] to be the ratio of the mean distance that rat travels during one θ-cycle to the size of the place ﬁeld,
ε = 2πv/Lωθ, where v is the rat’s speed and ωθ/2π is the frequency of the θ-signal.

γ-modulation. To incorporate the γ-rhythm into our model, we extracted the 30-80 Hz frequency band
from the same LFP signal so that all the existing correlations between θ and γ waves are preserved, and

10

shifted the simulated place cells’ spiking times towards the troughs of γ amplitude by modulating their
respective spiking rates with the additional Boltzmann factor [55],

Λγ(t) ∼ e−βγAγ(t),

(1)

where Aγ(t) is the amplitude of the γ-wave and 1/βγ is a formal parameter that plays the role of the eﬀective
temperature [103] (Figure 2). Simulating the net ﬁring rate as a product of all three factors

λnet = λc(x, y)Λθ,c(ϕ)Λγ(Aγ)

preserves spatial selectivity of spiking and the θ-precession (Figure S7) and forces the preferred phases of
the θ-phase precession ϕc into the γ-cycles, in accordance with the θ-γ theory [35, 38, 53].

Temperature of the cell assemblies. In a vicinity of the ith trough, the gamma signal has the form

Aγ(t) ≈ Aγ,0 − Aγ,i cos(ωit) ≈ aγ,i + Aγ,i

2 ,

(2)

where the parameters Aγ,0, Aγ,i and ωi deﬁne the mean level of Aγ, its instantaneous amplitude, and the
instantaneous frequency at the ith trough, and aγ,i = Aγ,0 − Aγ,i. Using the expansion (2) in (1) allows
estimating the spread ∆i of the spikes around the ith through from the Gaussian variance

This variance is about six times smaller than the instantaneous period, 6∆i ≈ Ti = 2π/ωi.Hence

which implies that the eﬀective temperature is approximately equal to the amplitude

βγ

Although the “eﬀective temperature” βγ may diﬀer between diﬀerent cell assemblies and diﬀerent γ-
troughs, we consider the simpliﬁed case in which a single parameter β deﬁnes the mean coupling between
the γ-wave’s amplitude and frequency and the place cell’s spike times across the entire place cell network.
By normalizing the amplitude Aγ by the σγ =
, A = Aγ/σγ, we get the scaled parameter
β = βγσγ, with the characteristic value

Cell types. The described approach can be applied to both the TroPyr and the RisPyr cells. Mathematically,
the “raising phases of γ” that controls spiking of the RisPyr cells correspond to the vicinities of peaks of the
γ-amplitude’s time derivative. Hence, the spiking probability of the RisPyr can be constrained by a factor
similar to (1), involving the derivative of the γ-amplitude, A(cid:48)(t), which would overridden the θ-precession
constraint (Λθ,c(ϕ) = 1) in the vicinity of the A(cid:48)(t)-peaks. The analysis of the mixed (RisPyr and TroPyr)
ensembles is more complex and requires a discussion sui generis.

Mathematical methods required for this study are based on the Persistent Homology Theory (see [23]

and [104, 105]) implemented in “JPlex” freeware package [106].

FIG. S1: Brain rhythms modulate place cell spiking activity. (A). Spike times precess with the θ-rhythm (red
wave): as the rat progresses through a place ﬁeld, the corresponding place cell discharges at a progressively earlier
phase in each new θ-cycle. These “preferred” phases of the θ-rhythm correspond to particular γ-cycles; the blue
wave shows the net θ + γ amplitude. The synchronized spikes (shown by tickmarks colored according to the place
ﬁelds traversed by the animal’s trajectory) cluster over the γ-troughs, yielding dynamical cell assemblies. (B) The
spread of spike times around the γ-troughs, by analogy with stochastic particles in a 1D potential (black curve). If the
temperature is high (dashed line, top panel), the particles (red dots) spread diﬀusely over the potential landscape, and
when the temperature is low (bottom panel), they are conﬁned at the bottoms of the potential wells. A similar eﬀect is
produced if the place cells’ ﬁring rate is modulating by the Boltzmann factor e−βγAγ(t), where Aγ(t) is the amplitude of
the γ-wave and βγ represents the inverse temperature. When βγ is low, the dynamical cell assemblies are “hot” (i.e.,
more spread in time), and when βγ is large, the spikes are concentrated at the γ-troughs.

16

FIG. S2: Histograms of the γ-phases at the times of place cell spiking, as a function of the inverse eﬀective
temperature β. The cooler the cell assemblies, the more the spikes are coupled with the γ-troughs.

17

FIG. S3: Freezing out spurious loops. Timelines of the topological loops in the coactivity complex produced in
the environment shown in Figure 1 for diﬀerent integration windows (scale of ws is shown on top) and for diﬀerent
eﬀective temperatures 1/β (colorbar on the right). As the width of the integration window decreases, the number of
spurious topological loops in the coactivity complex increases. For large ws, spurious loops tend to disappear with
learning (the times Tmin when the correct topological structure of Tσ emerges are marked by vertical dashed lines). For
small ws, some of these loops persist, indicating that the detected coactivity information is insuﬃcient for eliminating
spurious holes in Tσ. However, cooling down the coactivity complex suppresses the proliferation of the spurious
loops: at β = 2 (bottom row) the coactivity complex has a correct structure at the integration window w ≈ (2/3)Tθ.

18

FIG. S4: The eﬀect of γ-synchronization on spatial learning. Each panel represents the results of simulating 150
neuronal ensembles at diﬀerent eﬀective temperatures 1/β (colorbar on the right) and diﬀerent integration times w
(scale shown above). Each dot represents a particular ensemble of Nc place cells with the mean place ﬁeld size s. The
maximal ﬁring rates of the simulated neurons are lognormally distributed around f = 25 Hz (see Methods in [23, 24]).
The color of the dot indicates the average time Tmin required to encode an accurate map of the environment shown on
Figure 2A, averaged over ten place ﬁeld maps with the same (s, N). If the integration window is large (two left-most
columns), γ-synchronization does not produce a strong eﬀect on learning times. As the integration window becomes
smaller, cooling the coactivity complex increases the scope of successful place cell ensembles. This implies that that
γ-synchronization increases the resilience of the hippocampal network in the face of variations of the place-spiking

FIG. S5: The coactivity complexes. (A) Simplexes of the ˇCech coactivity complex represent simultaneous overlaps
of the place ﬁelds. (B) The place ﬁeld connectivity graph G: dots represent centers of the place ﬁelds, red links
represent overlaps between the place ﬁelds. The fully connected subgraphs of G (e.g., the six black links at the bottom
of the panel) are the cliques of G representing simplexes of the clique coactivity complex Tς.

FIG. S6: Freezing out the spurious loops in clique complex. Timelines of the topological loops in the clique
coactivity complex produced in the environment shown on Figure 1, for diﬀerent integration windows (scale of ws is
shown on top) and diﬀerent eﬀective temperatures 1/β (colorbar on the right). The learning times Tmin are marked by
red vertical dashed lines. The qualitative dependence of the number of topological loops in the coactivity complex on
the width of the integration window and the eﬀective temperature 1/β are similar to the ones produced by the coactivity
complex. However, the overall numbers of spurious topological loops is smaller, and the coactivity complex has a
correct structure even at the smallest integration window w ≈ (2/5)Tθ.

FIG. S7: Simulated place ﬁelds and the θ-precession are not aﬀected by the gamma modulation. (A) Place ﬁelds
shown for β = 0, β = 1 and β = 2. (B) The θ-phase/position diagram illustrating the θ-precession of a simulated place
cell for β = 0, β = 1 and β = 2.
