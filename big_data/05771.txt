ABSTRACT
We develop a model for subpulse separation period, P2, taking into account both
the apparent motion of the visible point as a function of pulsar phase, ψ, and the
possibility of abrupt jumps between diﬀerent rotation states in non-corotating pulsar
magnetospheres. We identify three frequencies: (i) the spin frequency of the star, (ii)
the drift frequency of the magnetospheric plasma in the source region, and (iii) the
angular frequency of the visible point around its trajectory. We show how the last
of these, which is neglected in traditional models by implicitly assuming the line of
sight through the center of the star, aﬀects the interpretation of P2. We attribute the
subpulse structure to emission from m anti-nodes distributed uniformly in azimuthal
angle about the magnetic axis. We show that variations of P2 as a function of rotational
phase or observing frequency arise naturally when the motion of the visible point is
taken into account. We discuss possible application of our model in signifying overall
ﬁeld-line distortion at the emitting region. Abrupt changes in P2 can occur during
state switching in the magnetosphere. We demonstrate that the unique value of P2
in each rotation state can be used, in principle, to relate the rotation state of the
magnetospheres to subpulse drifting.

INTRODUCTION

Drifting subpulses appear as a modulation of pulsar ra-
dio emission in which subpulses drift through the (inte-
grated) pulse window. The separation in time between
two adjacent subpulses is denoted by P2 (Sutton et al.
1970; Backer 1973), which is shorter than P1 = 2π/ω∗
(Ruderman & Sutherland 1975; Morozova et al.
2014),
where ω∗ is the rotation frequency of the star. In the
carousel model (Deshpande & Rankin 1999) subpulses are
interpreted as emission from plasma columns distributed
uniformly around the magnetic pole and rotating at ωdr 6=
ω∗. One possible interpretation of the “plasma columns”
is in terms of anti-nodes1 of a wave-like structure, gen-
erated by a large-scale instability in the magnetosphere
(Arons 1981; Jones 1984; Kazbegi et al. 1991). The dio-
cotron instability seems a plausible generation mechanism
(Fung et al. 2006; van Leeuwen & Timokhin 2012). Assum-
ing a wave at a speciﬁc spherical harmonic grows prefer-
entially (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975; Clemens & Rosen

1 Assuming either anti-nodes or nodes does not aﬀect our calcu-
lations.

2004; Godoberidze et al. 2005), the resulting pattern is pro-
portional to Y m
l (θb, φb), where l and m are integers and θb
and φb are polar and azimuthal angles, respectively, rela-
tive to the magnetic axis. Such a pattern, ∝ exp(imφb),
corresponds to m anti-nodes. The wave structure may be
propagating relative to the magnetospheric plasma, but for
simplicity the structures are usually assumed to be comov-
ing with the plasma. A detailed model for drifting subpulses
is needed to use the data to determine the actual motion of
magnetospheric plasma, and hence to provide information
on the electrodynamical processes that drive this motion.
A model for drifting subpulses also needs to accommodate
other observational features, such as curved driftbands and
abrupt changes in ωdr, so that these may be used to infer
further details regarding the magnetosphere.

Curved driftbands are common in radio pulsars
that exhibit drifting subpulses (Edwards & Stappers 2003;
Smits et al. 2005; Serylak et al. 2009; Hassall et al. 2013).
The “curvature” describes how P2 varies across the pulse
window. There is evidence, from observations at both ra-
dio and γ-ray frequencies, that a pulsar magnetosphere
may switch between diﬀerent rotation states, aﬀecting the
subpulse drift pattern (Stairs et al. 2000; Lyne et al. 2010;
Smits et al. 2005; Kramer et al. 2006; Allafort et al. 2013;

2

R. Yuen et. al.

Keith et al. 2013). By “rotation state” we mean a speciﬁc
value of ωdr (in the emission region), and the evidence im-
plies that a pulsar may jump abruptly between two or more
diﬀerent rotation states. A model for non-corotational mo-
tion is needed to describe the rotation states between which
such jumps occur.

In this paper we consider a model for drifting subpulses
that combines a quantitative model for the non-corotational
motion (of the magnetosphere of an oblique rotator) and
an eﬀect that has conventionally been ignored: the apparent
motion of the visible point. Our objectives are to develop
a quantitative model for the non-corotational motion and
apply it to observed changes associated with jumps between
rotation states, and to explore the implications of the motion
of the visible point on subpulses, speciﬁcally, the observed
variations of P2 in drifting subpulses.

Our quantitative model (Melrose & Yuen 2014) is based
on an interpolation of the plasma motions between two lim-
iting cases. One limit corresponds to the vacuum-dipole
model, in which there is no plasma, and the (inductive)
electric ﬁeld, Eind, is determined by the rotating magnetic
dipole. In this case, any test charge has an electric drift
across the magnetic ﬁeld lines, at a velocity vind say. We
interpret vind as the plasma ﬂow velocity in the limit where
the plasma density is arbitrarily small, such that there are
too few charges to provide the (additional) potential ﬁeld
implied by corotation. The other limit corresponds to coro-
tation, in which case the plasma velocity across the mag-
netic ﬁeld lines is the perpendicular component of the coro-
tation velocity, vcor⊥ say, which is the electric drift in the
corotation electric ﬁeld, Ecor. (The plasma motion along the
magnetic ﬁeld lines is unconstrained by the electrodynam-
ics.) We consider a one-parameter class of rotation states
described by the parameter y, such that the actual plasma
motion across the ﬁeld lines is yvind + (1 − y)vcor⊥. By
construction this model satisﬁes the requirement that the
ﬂow pattern is periodic, with period P1, although the mo-
tion of an individual plasma blob is not periodic (except for
y = 0). In this model, an abrupt change in rotation state is
parametrized by a change in y.

The apparent motion of the visible point follows from
the long-accepted assumption that pulsar emission is con-
ﬁned to a tiny cone about the tangent to the local magnetic
ﬁeld line (Radhakrishnan & Cooke 1969). This implies that
emission is visible only by an observer whose line of sight is
parallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld line. The line of sight to
this “visible point” varies in the transverse direction with
the phase of an oblique rotator, so that the visible point
moves around a trajectory at an apparent velocity that is
determined purely by geometry and the assumed magnetic
ﬁeld structure (Gangadhara 2004; Yuen & Melrose 2014).
(Existing models for drifting subpulses are based on the im-
plicit, but incorrect, assumption that the line of sight is a
ﬁxed line, e.g., through the center of the star.)

In Section 2 we discuss the apparent motion of the vis-
ible point. In Section 3 we summarize three motions that
can contribute to the observed P2. Variations in P2 are dis-
cussed in Section 4 in three diﬀerent, but related, contexts,
and a test case using PSR B0031-07 for our model is consid-
ered. We discuss the results and summarize our conclusions
in Section 5.

2 VISIBILITY OF EMITTING ANTI-NODES

In this
(Yuen & Melrose 2014) assumed in this paper.

section, we summarize the viewing geometry

2.1 Visible points in a magnetosphere

The angular position of the visible point on a sphere of ra-
dius r is independent of r in a dipolar magnetic ﬁeld. Let
this position be described by polar and azimuthal angles,
θ = θV (ζ, α; ψ) and φ = φV (ζ, α; ψ), in the observer’s frame,
or by (θbV , φbV ), where the subscript b represents quantities
in the magnetic frame. Here ζ and α correspond to the view-
ing angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight and
the obliquity angle between the rotation and magnetic axes,
respectively, and ψ is the rotational phase of the pulsar. The
transformation matrix between the two coordinate systems
is given in Appendix A. The visible point in the magnetic
frame is then given by (Gangadhara 2004; Yuen & Melrose
2014)

cos 2θbV =

1
3

tan φbV =

(cos θbp8 + cos2 θb − sin2 θb),

sin ζ sin ψ

sin α cos ζ − cos α sin ζ cos ψ

,

(1)

with cos θb = cos α cos θ + sin α sin θ cos(φ − ψ). For given
ζ, α the visible point traces out a closed path (on the sphere
of radius r) in one pulsar rotation, which we refer to as the
trajectory of the visible point.

The visibility of pulsar emission is dictated by the tra-
jectory of the visible point whose geometry depends strongly
on ζ, α (see Figure 1). The value of θV is maximum at ψ = 0
and minimum at ψ = 180◦. The traditional approach, in
which the line of sight is assumed ﬁxed, is a valid approx-
imation only in the limiting cases of ζ ∼= 0. We ignore the
special case ζ = 0 in the following discussion.

Assuming that pulsar emission comes only from open-
ﬁeld regions restricts the source location to radii greater
than a minimum visible height, rmin. For given ζ, α one has
(Yuen & Melrose 2014)

rmin =

rL sin2 θbV

sin2 θbL(φbV) sin θL(φbV)

,

(2)

where θL is the angle measured from the rotation axis to
the point where the last closed ﬁeld line is tangent to the
light cylinder. Emission is visible only while the trajectory
of the visible point is inside the open-ﬁeld region, and the
maximum width of the pulse window is the range of ψ over
which this condition is satisﬁed. This width increases with
increasing r − rmin and reduces to a point for r = rmin.
The pulse window is centered on ψ = 0, where the rotation
axis, magnetic axis and the line of sight are coplanar. The
pulse width increases as the impact parameter, deﬁned by
β = ζ − α, decreases.

2.2 Model for visible emission

A unique emission location in the magnetosphere may be
deﬁned by assuming that observable emission is only from
the last closed ﬁeld lines. In this model, the radial distance
from the center of the star to any points on the ﬁeld line at

φb, which is a function of ψ (see Appendix A), can be de-
termined using Equation (2) with polar angles given by the
trajectory of the visible point and known ﬁeld line constant.
Observable emission in the magnetosphere is therefore spec-
iﬁed by (rmin, θV , φV ) on each last closed ﬁeld lines around a
pulsar. These parameters vary with pulsar phase, with rmin
having its minimum at ψ = 0 and its maximum at ψ = 180◦.
It is only in the aligned case, α = 0, that rmin is independent
of ψ.

2.3 Emission height

The height (or radius r) of the source of pulsar radio emis-
sion is poorly determined, and is usually estimated based on
one of two methods: (i) a relativistic phase shift, which re-
quires an asymmetric pulse proﬁle with clearly deﬁned core
and cone components (Dyks et al. 2004), or (ii) geometry
alone, with the source located on the last closed ﬁeld lines
(Kijak & Gil 2003). We assume model (ii). This implies that
emission is visible from only one point in the magnetosphere
for any given ψ. For example, if one assumes a unique radius-
to-frequency mapping, then (ii) implies that emission at a
given frequency is visible from only one height.

Assumption (ii) may be modiﬁed to relax the implied
unique radius-to-frequency mapping. The emission is con-
ﬁned to a narrow forward cone (half-angle 1/γ, where γ is
the Lorentz factor of the emitting particle), which is at a
small angle to the magnetic ﬁeld line due to aberration,
so that there is some spread in emission about the direc-
tion tangent to the ﬁeld line. More importantly, one expects
emission from at least a small range of ﬁeld lines inside the
last closed ﬁeld line, and this translates into emission over
a corresponding small range of heights r > rmin.

2.4 Geometrical model for visible anti-nodes

We assume that there are m emission sites, corresponding to
anti-nodes, that are equally spaced in azimuth around the
magnetic axis. The location of the anti-nodes is then inde-
pendent of polar angle corresponding to alignment along the
radial direction in a structure of radial spokes as illustrated
in Figure 1. The trajectory of the visible point intersects
the spokes at diﬀerent polar angles, θb. The green, blue and
red curves correspond to non-circular trajectories of the vis-
ible point in speciﬁc oblique models, and the dark black cir-
cle corresponds to a circular trajectory in a speciﬁc aligned
case. It is apparent from the ﬁgure that, for an oblique ro-
tator, the trajectory is not concentric with the magnetic
axis (e.g., red, blue and green), and need not enclose the
magnetic axis (e.g., red and green). Moreover, it is only in
the aligned case that all anti-nodes are potentially visible
(when the restriction to emission only from within the polar
cap is relaxed); for example, fewer than 50% of the spokes
are intersected by the red trajectory. In traditional mod-
els (Edwards & Stappers 2003), the number of anti-nodes
is estimated from observation by implicitly assuming that
all are visible in principle, as for an aligned rotator. This
corresponds to the black curve, which is a circle centered
on the magnetic pole. We conclude, based on Figure 1, that
it is important to treat the geometry correctly, rather than
identifying potentially observable subpulses from a single
emission circle.

Variations of P2 in subpulse drifting pulsars

Figure 1. Plots of the trajectory of the visible point (solid curves)
are shown, projected onto the plane of the sky, for four choices of
(ζ, α): (50◦, 0) (black), (10◦, 30◦) (green), (60◦, 45◦) (blue) and
(70◦, 80◦) (red). Also shown are radial spoke structure of aligned
anti-nodes spaced equally around the star (black sold circle) in
the magnetic frame centered on the magnetic pole. A trajectory
starts at a point on the xb-axis closest to the origin at ψ = 0◦ then
progresses in clockwise direction and intersects with the xb-axis
again at the farthest point from the origin reaching the highest
height of the path at ψ = 180◦, then returns to the starting point.
Emission is visible in principle only from a spoke that is inside
the relevant trajectory.

Note that the restriction to emission from within the
polar cap is not taken into account in Figure 1. The number
of spokes intersected by a trajectory, and hence the num-
ber of visible anti-nodes, depends strongly on r/rmin > 1,
with rmin given by Equation (2), and for a given r/rmin the
polar-cap region deﬁnes an additional closed region in the
ﬁgure (Yuen & Melrose 2014). For the model discussed in
Section 2.2, the trajectory cuts spokes at diﬀerent θV , φV
and hence at diﬀerent heights, implying that emission is
from higher (lower) altitudes at the edges (center) of a pro-
ﬁle (Gangadhara & Gupta 2001; Karastergiou & Johnston
2007).

3 THREE FREQUENCIES RELEVANT TO

SUBPULSE DRIFTING

Three frequencies are relevant to a model for subpulse drift-
ing: (i) the spin frequency of the star, ω⋆, (ii) a frequency,
ωV , associated with the motion of the visible point, and (iii)
the drift frequency of the plasma, ωdr. In this section, we
discuss how these frequencies relate to P2.

3.1 Motion of the visible point

The visible point moves at an angular velocity ωV along
the trajectory with components in the polar and azimuthal

4

directions:

ωVθ = ω⋆

∂θ(α, ψ)

∂ψ

, ωVφ = ω⋆

∂φ(α, ψ)

∂ψ

,

(3)

where ω⋆ = dψ/dt is the angular speed of the star. The
motion of the visible point is absent only for an aligned
rotator, α = 0. Another special case is for the line of sight
along the rotation axis, when the visible point moves only
in the ˆφ direction as the pulsar rotates. In the general case,
the visible point sub-rotates when the magnetic axis is on
the near side of the pulsar (near ψ = 0), and super-rotates
when the magnetic axis is on the far side of the pulsar (near
ψ = 180◦). The average angular speed, hωV (ψ)i = ω⋆, is
equal to that of the star. For pulsars with a small pulse
window, the observer sees only a small range of φ centered
on φ = ψ = 0 where ωV is lowest.

3.2 Plasma drift velocity

The plasma drift velocity is modeled here as a linear com-
bination of the electric drift velocities in the vacuum-
dipole and corotation models (Melrose & Yuen 2014). For
an obliquely rotating pulsar the electric ﬁeld is assumed to
be of the form

E = (1 − yb b·)Eind − (1 − y)grad Φcor,

(4)

where b is the unit vector along the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld, and where −grad Φcor is the potential electric ﬁeld as-
sociated with the corotation charge density. (The corotation
electric ﬁeld is given by Equation (4) with y = 0.) The elec-
tric drift velocity due to this electric ﬁeld is

vdr = yvind + (1 − y)vcor⊥.

(5)

We write ωdr = vdr/r, and note that only the non-radial
components of vdr contribute to the apparent rotation fre-
quency of the plasma.

The apparent observed ωdr is the projection onto the
trajectory of the visible point. Figure 2 illustrates the change
of ωdr/ω⋆ as a function of ψ along the trajectory of the vis-
ible point (dotted) and the projected component (solid) for
diﬀerent y values as given by Equation (5). Except in lim-
iting cases (ζ = 0, α = 0, 180◦), which we ignore, the pro-
jected value is always lower than ωdr. We use the projected
component for the following calculations.

Figure 2. The drift frequency, ωdr/ω⋆ (dotted), and its projec-
tion (solid) onto the trajectory of the visible point, are plotted
against ψ for ζ = 70◦ and α = 80◦ and y = 0 (blue), 0.3 (green),
0.6 (red) and 0.9 (black).

3.4 Interval of subpulse separation

Suppose one ignores both the motion of the visible point,
ωV → 0, and the relative motion of the wave structure to
the plasma. Then m anti-nodes would pass through the (as-
sumed ﬁxed) line of sight in the time, 2π/ωdr, that it takes
for the plasma to make a complete rotation. An observer
would see consecutive anti-nodes separated by an interval

P2,S(y) =

2π

mωdr

.

(6)

This interval is modiﬁed when the motion of the visible point
(ωV 6= 0) is taken into account. If the anti-nodes move faster
(slower) than the visible point, emission from consecutive
anti-nodes appears to arrive progressively earlier (later). The
time interval (6) is replaced by

P2(y) =

2π

mωdr − ωV

.

Rewriting Equation (7) in units of P1 gives

P2(y)

P1

= (cid:0)mRdr − RV(cid:1)−1

,

(7)

(8)

where Rdr = Rdr(y) = ωdr/ω⋆ and RV = ωV /ω⋆. Note that
the subpulse separation period is a function of y, potentially
allowing y to be determined from observations.

3.3 Motion of standing wave

3.5 Eﬀect of motion of visible point

A purely magnetospheric model for drifting subpulses, as
opposed to a model related to structures (e.g., “hot spots”)
on the surface of the star, requires that there be some quasi-
stable structure in the source region. The assumption made
here is that this is a standing wave at a speciﬁc spherical har-
monic, with given l and m, implying m nodes and anti-nodes
as a function of azimuthal angle. In general one expects such
a wave to be propagating, at a velocity that depends on l and
m. For simplicity, we assume that the propagation velocity
of the wave structure relative to the plasma is negligible.
In a more general model the relative velocity of the wave
structure to the plasma should be taken into account.

We can make explicit the predicted eﬀect of the motion of
the visible point on P2 by comparing Equations (6) and (7).
The ratio of the value of P2 when ωV is artiﬁcially set to
zero to that for ωV 6= 0 is

P2
P2,S

= Rd(y) = (cid:18)1 −

ωV

mωdr(cid:19)−1

.

(9)

Equation (9) quantiﬁes the discrepancy introduced, in tradi-
tional models, by assuming a ﬁxed line of sight, rather than
the line of sight that is always tangent to the ﬁeld line in
the source region (Yuen & Melrose 2014).

Figure 3 illustrates Rd at ψ = 0 for α = ζ ranging

changes sign at large ψ for small y.

for diﬀerent y is indistinguishable for ∆ψ ≪ 50◦ around ψ = 0.

and 0.9 (dot-dashed). The horizontal gray line at Rd = 1 would
correspond to no error being introduced in the predicted P2 by
neglecting the motion of the visible point. The discrepancy is
always greater than one and increases as either α decreases or y
increases.

from 5◦ to 90◦ for four diﬀerent y values. The discrepancy
increases as α decreases and approaches unity at large α.
This implies that the traditional models underestimate P2,
giving a good approximations only for pulsars with α > 45◦.
Simulations using diﬀerent values of m give similar results
although better agreement is obtained for m & 30.

4 VARIATIONS OF P2

In this section we discuss several diﬀerent eﬀects that can
cause a non-constant P2.

4.1 Changes with rotational phase

Simulations based on Equation (8) show that the value of
P2 varies as a function of ψ with the variability decreasing
as y increases. For large y → 1, corresponding to a near-
vacuum model, P2 is mostly constant throughout the whole
rotational phase for small ζ as shown in Figures 4 – 6. The
anti-node number is chosen to be m = 20 for simulations in
this paper (Godoberidze et al. 2005; Mitra & Rankin 2008).
The subpulse separation period, P2, has its maximum at
ψ = 180◦, on the far side of the magnetosphere relative to
the line of sight, and its minimum at ψ = 0. The rate of
change of P2 with ψ is smaller for larger α for a given y
with ψ remaining . 1 rad. It follows that for the pulsars
with narrower pulse proﬁles, variations in P2 are smaller.

For the pulsars with broad pulse proﬁles the variations
in P2 can be signiﬁcant at large rotational phases. This fol-
lows from Equation (7), which implies that P2 approaches in-
ﬁnity for mωdr → ωV , and becomes negative for mωdr < ωV ,
implying a reverse in the sense of subpulse drift. Such rever-
sal is predicted at large rotational phase, where ωV increases
towards its maximum at ψ = ±180◦. Depending on ζ and
α, there may exist a point in ψ where mωdr = ωV as shown
in Figure 5 at around ψ ≈ ±150◦ and ±170◦ for y = 0 and
0.3, respectively.

R. Yuen et. al.

4.2 Frequency-dependent changes

In the magnetic dipole model the angular width of the ra-
dio pulse proﬁles is frequency-dependent. Emission at lower
frequencies, ν, originates from larger heights, r > rmin, and
has a wider emission cone (Craft & Comella 1968; Cordes
1978; Thorsett 1991). The spread in ν at a given r, however,
is not known.

Consider a highly idealized model in which (a) emission
is only from the last closed ﬁeld line, and (b) the emission
from given r is at a unique frequency, ν(r) say, which is a
decreasing function of r. In this model, emission from the
last closed ﬁeld line implies r = rmin(ψ) (cf. Section 2.2),
and observable emission is at ν = ν(rmin, ψ), which varies
with θbV (ψ), φbV (ψ) due to rmin being a unique function
of these angles. In this model, the emission at the begin-
ning and end of the pulse, that is, at ψ = ψ1, ψ2, is at a
speciﬁc frequency, and within the pulse, the frequency in-
creases as ψ − ψ1 increases, reaching a maximum, and then
decreasing as ψ2 − ψ decreases. This implies a wider range
of observable ψ at lower frequencies as shown in Figures
1, 4 and 6. Because P2 is a function of ψ, which increases
as |ψ| increases, the average P2 over a broader proﬁle also
increases. This is consistent with observations, which show
that P2 is frequency-dependent, increasing as frequency de-
creases (Taylor et al. 1975; Smits et al. 2005).

4.3 Changes with rotation states

Recent observations indicate that some radio pulsars can
have multiple, quasi-stable conﬁgurations of their magneto-
spheres (Stairs et al. 2000; Smits et al. 2005; Kramer et al.
2006; Keith et al. 2013), and can switch abruptly between
one conﬁguration and another. In our model
for non-
corotating pulsar magnetospheres, such conﬁgurations are
referred as rotation states and are diﬀerentiated by the
value of the parameter y (Melrose & Yuen 2014). An abrupt
change in y corresponds to an abrupt change in ωdr, cf.
Equations (4) and (5), and hence to an abrupt change in
P2.

For relatively large obliquity, α & 45◦, and small ζ,
P2 is relatively insensitive to changes of rotation states for
ψ ≪ 50◦ but becomes signiﬁcant for large ψ, where the value
of ωdr may approach ωV . The magnitude of the change in
P2 between diﬀerent y at a given ψ increases as α decreases.
Assuming that α decreases with increasing age, this leads
to the prediction that the eﬀect of state switching on P2
variation for a ﬁxed ψ or across a pulse window is larger for
older pulsars.

4.4 A test case: PSR B0031-07

We apply the foregoing model to PSR B0031-07, assuming
ζ = 6◦ and α = 5◦ (Smits et al. 2007), modeling P2 at three
diﬀerent emission heights for four diﬀerent rotation states.
The results are shown in Table 1. The emission height is de-
termined by the model described in Section 2.2. For a given
y 6 0.6, P2 increases with r. Assuming a radius to frequency
mapping, with lower frequencies from greater heights, this
implies that P2 increases as the observing frequency de-
creases (Taylor et al. 1975). The ratio P2/P1 becomes in-
ﬁnite and changes sign for large y. The model implies that if

Table 1. The value of P2/P1 is given for three emission heights,
min in units of 10−4 rL (top row), for four
denoted ra
rotation states of y = 0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 (leftmost column). The
min and rc
ra
min are determined exactly in our model based on the
size of the pulse windows at 4.85 GHz (for 20◦) and 328 MHz
(for 30◦), respectively, in drift-mode A (Smits et al. 2005), and
rb
min is assumed to correspond to 1.41 GHz. The value of P2/P1
increases as r increases for y 6 0.6 and passes through inﬁnity
between y = 0.6 and y = 0.9, implying a reversal in the sense
of subpulse drifting. The unique value of P2/P1 for each y and r
can be used to derive the ratio of P2/P1 between diﬀerent r for
a particular y.

the pulsar were to switch from a value of y below where the
sign change occurs to a value above this change, then the
sense of subpulse drifting would reverse. The frequency de-
pendence also reverses such that P2 decreases with ν. Such
reversal is not observed. One interpretation is that rotation
states with large y do not occur in this pulsar.

Interpretation of the values in Table 1 depends on the
drift rate and pulse window size. For example, consider the
case y = 0.6.

Case 1: Low drift rate and narrow pulse window, as
in drift mode A at 4.85 GHz. This corresponds to P2/P1
min = 2.6 × 10−4 rL. In this case, a subpulse
= 3.05 and ra
drifts suﬃciently slowly such that it completes its traversal
across the pulse window before the following subpulse ap-
pears. The driftbands are therefore non-overlapping in pulse
period. The vertical and horizontal separations at the start
and ﬁnish of the two driftbands are three pulse periods and
∼ 15◦, respectively.

Case 2: High drift rate and wide pulse window, as in
drift mode A at 328 MHz. This corresponds to P2/P1 =
min = 3.7 × 10−4 rL. In this case, the subpulses
3.10 at rc
drift suﬃciently rapidly to give two ‘overlapping’ driftbands.
The vertical spacing between subpulses within a driftband
is about six pulse periods. This spacing causes the emission
from subpulses to be separated and the driftbands to appear
‘fainter’ (Smits et al. 2005). A smaller y implies a smaller
P2/P1, corresponding to a closer separation of subpulses in
a driftband, cf. mode B of Smits et al. (2005). The vertical
and horizontal separations between two subpulses (in two
consecutive driftbands) are three pulse periods and ∼ 30◦,
respectively.

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we point out an inconsistency in most treat-
ments of subpulse drifting due to an incorrect assumption
(that the line of sight is assumed ﬁxed as the pulsar ro-
tates). We investigate the consequence of the apparent mo-
tion of the visible point, which is assumed tangent to the
magnetic ﬁeld line in the source region. For a ﬁxed line of

sight the visible point would rotate at angular speed ω∗ in
a circle centered on the magnetic pole, whereas the visible
point actually moves at non-constant angular speed around
a non-circular trajectory that may or may not enclose the
magnetic pole. We show how the separation between con-
secutive subpulses, P2, is aﬀected by taking the actual tra-
jectory into account. We also explore the implications of one
speciﬁc model for a non-corotating (oblique) pulsar magne-
tosphere. In this model the plasma drift velocity is described
by a single parameter 0 < y < 1, and a change in rotation
state is attributed to a change in y.

We refer to the diﬀerence between a model that includes
the apparent motion of the visible point and a model that
neglects it as a “discrepancy”. For the speciﬁc model as-
sumed in this paper, we quantify the discrepancy in terms
of the parameter Rd(y) introduced in Equation (9). The dis-
crepancy is small for pulsars with large α and narrow pulse
proﬁles, but becomes signiﬁcant for pulsars with small α and
broad proﬁles.

Our model remains highly idealized, leading to limita-
tions that need to be relaxed in a more detailed model for P2.
One limitation is that our model applies only to lowest or-
der in an expansion in r/rL. Various additional eﬀects give
corrections at diﬀerent orders in this expansion, including
non-dipolar ﬁelds, aberration, retardation and sweepback.
To illustrate these eﬀects, consider the particular case y = 0
(solid curve) in Figure 6, which has a pulse duty cycle of
0.1 centered at ψ = 0. Then P2 increases with increasing
|ψ|, implying that neighboring anti-nodes appear to have a
larger separation for large ψ than for ψ = 0. In this spe-
cial case, the maximum change in P2 across the pulse win-
dow is about 1%. Variations in P2 have been observed with
PSR B0809+74, which shows as an increase of about 1.5%
from the leading to trailing parts across the proﬁle (Bartel
1981; Wolszczan et al. 1981; Davies et al. 1984). The linear
increase, as opposed to a symmetrical change, may be due
to the fact that the pulse proﬁle is asymmetric perhaps due
to a non-dipolar ﬁeld structure. Deviation from a dipolar
ﬁeld, ∝ 1/r3, is always present in an oblique rotator, due
to retardation implying an inductive term ∝ r−2 and the
radiative term ∝ r−1 (Arendt & Eilek 1998; Cheng et al.
2000). Another possible modiﬁcation to a centered dipolar
ﬁeld is an additional crust-anchored dipolar ﬁeld (Gil et al.
2002). Emission from such non-dipolar conﬁgurations can
result in the center of the proﬁle being shifted away from
ψ = 0. This would break the symmetry in the variations
of P2. Field-line distortion aﬀects single-peak proﬁles, caus-
ing a diﬀerence in P2 about a ﬁducial point (ψ = 0 in our
model). The sign of the diﬀerence signiﬁes the rotation di-
rection such that positive and negative values correspond
to leftward and rightward rotations, respectively, relative to
the line of sight.

In principle, it is possible to use data on P2 to deter-
mine the rotation state, or at least to restrict the allowed
range of y, as shown in Section 4.4. For example, in the case
of PSR B0031-07 with duty cycle of about 0.1, a match in
the predicted variations of P2 across diﬀerent r with obser-
vations is found to correspond to y = 0.6. To achieve higher
accuracy requires precise knowledge of ζ and α. For most
pulsars, however, these two parameters are uncertain, lim-
iting the reliability of any comparison between predictions
and observations. A further uncertainty arises from an angu-

lar error introduced by the (incorrect) assumption that the
line of sight passes through center of the star. This leads to
an overestimation of α, for β > 0, or to an underestimation
of α, for β < 0 (Yuen & Melrose 2014).

The observable eﬀects discussed in this paper are rela-
tively small for most pulsars, especially for those with large
α and narrow pulse proﬁles. Future availability of large ar-
rays and telescopes, such as the SKA and FAST, will provide
wide bandwidth coverage and unparallel sensitivity and time
resolution, and will allow one to map the small changes in
the subpulse driftbands predicted here. This will lead to a
new era in investigating magnetospheric phenomena, signif-
icantly improve our understanding of drifting subpulses and
of pulsar electrodynamics more generally.

5.1 Summary

We summarize our results in dot-point form.

• The path traced by the visible point on a sphere of
radius r in any pulsar magnetospheres is neither circular
nor centered at the magnetic axis, except for special cases.
• Emission is assumed to be conﬁned to anti-nodes which
form spokes relative to the magnetic axis. A given spoke is
visible only if trajectory of the visible point crosses it.

• Estimation from observation of the total number, m,
of anti-nodes or spokes is possible only for a narrow pulse
proﬁle or ζ = 0.

• Variations of P2 result from the relative motion of drift-

ing anti-nodes, at ωdr, and the visible point, at ωV .

• Abrupt changes of P2 at a given ψ are attributed to
switching in the magnetospheres between diﬀerent rotation
states, each characterized by unique y and associated ωdr(y).
• P2 is a function of ψ; it is a minimum at ψ = 0 and
increases as ψ increases; the change in P2 is small for −50◦ 6
ψ 6 50◦, and for pulsars with narrow pulse proﬁles.

• Traditional models, which implicitly assume ωV = 0,
give good approximations for P2 only for pulsars with α &
45◦, m & 30 and narrow pulse proﬁles.
