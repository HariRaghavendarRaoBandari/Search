Abstract

We introduce a method for a combined calculation of charge and vector spin transport of elasti-

cally tunneling electrons in magnetic scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The method is based

on the three-dimensional Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (3D-WKB) approach combined with elec-

tronic structure calculations using ﬁrst principles density functional theory. As an application, we

analyze the STM contrast inversion of the charge current above the Fe/W(110) surface depending

on the bias voltage, tip-sample distance and relative magnetization orientation between the sample

and an iron tip. For the spin transfer torque (STT) vector we ﬁnd that its in-plane component

is generally larger than the out-of-plane component. Our results suggest that the torque-current

relationship in magnetic STM junctions follows the power law rather than a linear function. Con-

sequently, we show that the ratio between the STT and the spin-polarized charge current is not

constant, and more importantly, it can be tuned by the bias voltage, tip-sample distance and

magnetization rotation. We ﬁnd that the STT eﬃciency can be enhanced by about two orders of

magnitude by selecting a proper bias voltage. Thus, we demonstrate the possible enhancement of

the STT eﬃciency in magnetic STM junctions, which can be exploited in technological applica-

tions. We discuss our results in view of the indirect measurement of the STT above the Fe/W(110)

surface reported by Krause et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 186601 (2011).

INTRODUCTION

Current induced magnetization switching in metallic spin valves and magnetic tunnel

junctions (MTJs) is an intensive area of research for its possible applications in future

spintronic/magnetic devices [1]. During electronic transport, inseparable from the charge

current the electrons also transfer spins. If electron transfer occurs between two ferromagnets

having a noncollinear magnetic alignment, the transmitted spin transfer torque (STT) is

directly responsible for the magnetization switching. The ﬁrst direct measurement of the

in-plane and out-of-plane components of the STT vector in a MTJ was performed by Sankey

et al. [2]. On the other hand, there is a number of diﬀerent theoretical approaches reported

to calculate the STT vector in MTJs. A brief overview is given below.

Free-electron models have been employed by several authors [3–5]. They used the

Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation for the propagated wave functions. Slon-

czewski worked out the theory of STT within Bardeen’s transfer Hamiltonian method [6].

Tight-binding models in combination with Keldysh nonequilibrium Green’s function for-

malism have been extensively used [7–9]. Very recently, the eﬀects of magnetic insulating

[10] and ferroelectric [11] barriers on the STT have been investigated by the tight-binding

method. A scattering theory of STT has been proposed by Xiao et al.

[12]. A fully ab

initio method based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker multiple scattering theory has been

provided by Heiliger and Stiles [13]. As of particular technological importance, they studied

the Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ, and found quantitative agreement with the experimental STT results

of Sankey et al. [2]. Jia et al. studied the same Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ by a ﬁrst-principles-based

transport method and considered the eﬀect of disorder scattering in MgO [14].

The listed theoretical models consider symmetric or asymmetric planar junction geome-

tries to address STT eﬀects in MTJs. However, there is a growing interest to obtain informa-

tion on local STT properties in high spatial resolution in asymmetric MTJs. Spin-polarized

scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) proved to be extremely useful to provide local

information on spin-polarized charge transport properties in a wide variety of magnetic sur-

faces [15]. As an important recent application, local current (and thus STT) pulses have

been used to create and annihilate individual magnetic skyrmion structures in a thin ﬁlm

system [16]. Based on above, we propose the generalization of high resolution STM charge

transport theories [17] to include the description of vector spin transport in STM junctions.

3

In this work, we present a combined theory for charge and vector spin transport in magnetic

STM junctions within the three-dimensional (3D) WKB electron tunneling framework, in-

cluding electronic structures of both the surface and the tip calculated by ﬁrst principles

methods. We investigate the Fe/W(110) surface motivated by a recent indirect local STT

measurement performed by SP-STM [18]. Based on our results, we propose that the STT

eﬃciency in this system can be enhanced by about two orders of magnitude by selecting

a proper bias voltage. Moreover, given the exponentially decaying electron transmission in

the MTJ with increasing tip-sample distance, we ﬁnd that the torque-current relationship

follows the power law rather than a linear function.

The paper is organized as follows: The 3D-WKB theoretical model of combined charge

and vector spin transport in magnetic STM is presented in section II. Computational details

of the electronic structure calculations are given in section III. We investigate the electron

charge and spin transport in a magnetic tunnel junction consisting of one monolayer Fe on

the W(110) surface in combination with a Fe(001) tip in section IV. We focus on the STM

contrast formation of the spin-polarized charge current and its determining factors in section

IV A, and study vector spin transport characteristics by analyzing the spin transfer torque

vector and its relation to the spin-polarized charge current in section IV B. Our conclusions

are found in section V.

3D-WKB MODEL OF COMBINED CHARGE AND VECTOR SPIN TRANS-

PORT IN STM

Based on atom-superposition techniques [19–22], the 3D-WKB electron tunneling theory

[23–26] implemented in the 3D-WKB-STM code [27] became an established method for the

simulation of (spin-polarized) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. The model

assumes that electron tunneling occurs through a tip apex atom, and individual transitions

between this tip apex atom and a suitable number of sample surface atoms, each described

by the one-dimensional (1D) WKB approximation, are superimposed. Orbital-dependent

tunneling is included in the model by a modiﬁed transmission function [26]. Since the 3D

geometry of the tunnel junction is considered, the method is, in eﬀect, a 3D-WKB atom-

superposition approach. Its main advantages are computational eﬃciency, see, e.g., Refs.

[26, 28], and an enhanced parameter space for modeling tip geometries, i.e., arbitrary relative

4

tip-sample orientations [29, 30]. The 3D-WKB method has been applied to spin-polarized

STM, and an analysis of the interplay of orbital-dependent and spin-polarization eﬀects was

reported on the STM image contrast formation above the Fe(110) surface [31].

For the combined 3D-WKB model for charge and vector spin transport, we adopt the

orbital- and spin-dependent formalism introduced in Ref. [31]. The electronic structure of the

magnetic surface and the tip is included in the model by taking the atom-projected electron

density of states (PDOS) obtained by ab initio electronic structure calculations. The orbital-

decomposition of the PDOS is necessary for the description of the orbital-dependent electron

tunneling [26], and both the charge PDOS and the magnetization PDOS vector are essential

for spin-dependent tunneling [24]. The energy-dependent orbital-decomposed charge PDOS

of the ath sample surface (S) atom with orbital symmetry σ and the tip (T ) apex atom

with orbital symmetry τ are denoted by na
Sσ(E) and nT τ (E), respectively. In our model
σ, τ ∈ {s, py, pz, px, dxy, dyz, d3z2−r2, dxz, dx2−y2} atomic orbitals are considered but this can
be extended to treat f electron orbitals as well [32]. Similarly to the charge PDOS, ma
Sσ(E)
and mT τ (E) denote the corresponding energy-dependent orbital-decomposed magnetization

PDOS vectors. In the simplest case there are ﬁxed spin quantization axes of the sample and

the tip that can be described by energy-independent eS and eT unit vectors, respectively.

We focus on this case in the present work, allowing an arbitrary φ angle between eS and
eT . The corresponding PDOS can be calculated from the spin-up (n↑) and spin-down (n↓)
contributions obtained from ﬁrst principles collinear magnetic calculations for the sample

surface and the tip separately [24]: The orbital-decomposed charge PDOS are

(6)

Since eS · eT = cos(φ) with φ the angle between the spin quantization axes of the sample
surface and the tip, the formula of the charge transport (conductance) is formally consistent

with the spin-polarized Tersoﬀ-Hamann model [35], except the fact that it explicitly includes

where the ﬁrst and second term is respectively the non-spin-polarized and spin-polarized

part of the charge current contribution. On the other hand, we identify the components of

the spin transport formula as the in-plane and out-of-plane spin torkances [12]:

(8)

Here, the in-plane component ˜T(cid:107) lies in the plane spanned by the eS and eT vectors. Its
direction is, however, not necessarily perpendicular to the magnetic moment the torkance

is acting on, it rather depends on the electronic structures of both the surface (nS, mS) and
the tip (nT , mT ) sides of the STM junction. Moreover, since eS × eT = sin(φ)e{eS×eT }, ˜T⊥ is
perpendicular to the eS-eT plane and in line with the e{eS×eT } normal-to-plane unit vector.
Its size depends on the magnetization PDOS mS, mT and on the φ angle. Note that if eS
and eT are in line (φ = 0 or φ = ±π) then the out-of-plane torkance component is zero
and the spin-polarized part of the charge conductance is largest in magnitude, whereas if eS
is perpendicular to eT (φ = ±π/2) then the out-of-plane torkance component is largest in
magnitude and the spin-polarized part of the charge conductance is zero.

The total tunneling charge current and the components of the spin transfer torque (STT)

vector are calculated from the charge conductance and the components of the spin torkance

vector by the superposition of atomic contributions from the sample surface (sum over a)

and the superposition of transitions from all atomic orbital combinations between the sample

and the tip (sum over σ and τ ) integrated in an energy window corresponding to the bias

voltage V . Assuming elastic electron tunneling at temperature T = 0 K, the charge current,

Here, e is the elementary charge, h is the Planck constant, and ES

F are the Fermi
energies of the sample surface and the tip, respectively. The 2e2/h and 2e factors ensure

F and ET

the correct dimension of the charge current and the spin transfer torque components, respec-

tively. The value of  has to be determined by comparing the simulation results of the charge

current with experiments, or with calculations using standard methods, e.g., the Bardeen

approach [36]. In our simulations  = 1 eV was chosen that gives comparable current values

with those obtained by the Bardeen method [26] implemented in the BSKAN code [37, 38].

Note that the choice of  has no qualitative inﬂuence on the reported results.

In Eq.(10), ˆTστ (E, V, da) is the orbital-dependent tunneling transmission function that
gives the probability of the electron charge/spin tunneling from the τ orbital of the tip apex

atom to the σ orbital of the ath surface atom, or vice versa, depending on the sign of the

8

bias voltage. The conventions of tip → sample tunneling at positive bias voltage (V > 0)
and sample → tip tunneling at negative bias (V < 0) are used. The STT is acting on the
magnetic moments where the charge current ﬂows, i.e., on the sample moments at positive

and on the tip moments at negative bias voltage. The transmission probability depends on

the energy of the electron (E), the bias voltage (V ), and the relative position of the tip
apex atom and the ath sample surface atom (da = RT IP − Ra). The following form for the
transmission function is considered [29]:

(11)

Here, the exponential factor corresponds to an orbital-independent transmission, where all

electron states are considered as exponentially decaying spherical states [19, 22, 39]. This
factor depends on the distance between the tip apex atom and the ath surface atom, |da|,
and on the 1D-WKB vacuum decay of electron states,

(12)

For using this κ an eﬀective rectangular potential barrier in the vacuum between the sample

and the tip is assumed. ΦS and ΦT are the electron work functions of the sample surface
and the tip, respectively, m is the electron’s mass and  the reduced Planck constant. The
remaining factors of Eq.(11) are responsible for the orbital dependence of the transmission.

They modify the exponentially decaying part according to the real-space shape of the elec-

tron orbitals involved in the tunneling, i.e., the angular dependence of the electron densities

of the atomic orbitals of the surface and the tip is taken into account as the square of the
real spherical harmonics χσ(θa, ϕa) and χτ (θ(cid:48)
a), respectively. The distinction between
the local coordinate systems of the sample surface (without primes) and the tip apex atom

a, ϕ(cid:48)

(denoted by primes) enables the consideration of arbitrary relative tip-sample geometrical

orientations within the orbital-dependent 3D-WKB approach [28–30]. The polar and az-
imuthal angles (θ((cid:48))
the tunneling direction, i.e., the line connecting the ath surface atom and the tip apex

a ) given in both real spherical harmonics in Eq.(11) correspond to

a , ϕ((cid:48))

atom, as viewed from their local coordinate systems, and they have to be determined from

the actual tip-sample geometry.

III. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

We have performed geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations within

the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the density functional theory (DFT) im-

plemented in the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) [40–42]. A plane wave basis

set for electronic wave function expansion in combination with the projector augmented

wave (PAW) method [43] has been applied. We have adopted the parametrization of the

exchange-correlation functional by Perdew and Wang (PW91) [44]. The electronic structures

of the Fe/W(110) surface and the Fe(001) tip have been calculated separately.

We model the Fe/W(110) surface by a slab of nine atomic layers (8 tungsten and 1 iron
layers) with the bulk lattice constant of aW = 3.165 ˚A. A separating vacuum region of 18
˚A width in the surface normal (z) direction between neighboring supercell slabs is set up to

minimize slab-slab interaction. After geometry optimization the Fe-W interlayer distance

between the two topmost layers is reduced by 14%, and the underneath W-W interlayer

distance is increased by 1% in comparison to bulk tungsten. The magnitude of the in-plane

spin moment of the surface Fe atoms is 2.31 µB and the induced moments in the neighboring

W layer are -0.14 µB per tungsten atom (opposite in orientation compared to the surface

Fe spin moments). The structural parameters and magnetic properties of Fe/W(110) are in

good agreement with Refs. [45, 46]. The spin quantization axis (eS, magnetic easy axis) is
pointing to the [1¯10] crystallographic direction. The average electron work function above

the Fe/W(110) surface is ΦS = 4.73 eV calculated from the local electrostatic potential.
We have used an 11 × 11 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack [47] k-point grid for obtaining the orbital-
decomposed projected charge and magnetization electron DOS onto the surface Fe atom,

nSσ(E) and mSσ(E), respectively.

We model the STM tip as a blunt iron tip, where a single Fe apex atom is placed on

the hollow position of the Fe(001) surface, similarly as in Ref. [48]. More details of the

Fe(001) tip model can be found in Ref. [31]. The orbital-decomposed electronic structure

data projected to the tip apex atom, nT τ (E) and mT τ (E), have been calculated using a
13 × 13 × 3 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid. The orientation of the tip spin quantization axis
eT relative to eS is arbitrarily changed and their angle is denoted by φ.

For calculating the spin-polarized charge current and the spin transfer torque vector, we

choose 112 iron atoms on the Fe/W(110) surface for the atomic superposition [31].

Figure 1 shows the energy-dependent orbital-decomposed charge PDOS (n = n↑ +n↓) and
spin-resolved PDOS (n↑,↓) functions of the Fe surface atom in Fe/W(110) and the Fe(001)
tip apex atom. We ﬁnd that the d partial PDOS is dominating over s and p partial PDOS,

and the minority spin character is dominating over the majority spin in the vicinity of the

Fermi levels. The obtained results are in good agreement with the total (orbital-summed) Fe

PDOS functions reported in Refs. [45, 48, 49], where the full potential linearized augmented

plane wave (FLAPW) method was employed in diﬀerent computational implementations

(Wien2k and FLEUR codes).

Charge current STM contrast inversion

As demonstrated for W(110) and Fe(110) surfaces in Refs. [26, 31], the charge current

diﬀerence between tip positions above the top and hollow surface sites of BCC(110) surfaces

is indicative for the corrugation character of a constant-current STM image. The charge

current diﬀerence at tip-sample distance z and bias voltage V is deﬁned as

∆I(z, V ) = I top(z, V ) − I hollow(z, V ).

(13)

Positive ∆I corresponds to an STM image with normal corrugation, where the atomic sites

appear as protrusions. Conversely, negative ∆I is related to an STM image with inverted

contrast, i.e., anticorrugation, and atomic sites appearing as depressions. The ∆I(z, V ) = 0

contour gives the (z, V ) combinations where the corrugation inversion occurs.

Figure 2 shows such zero current diﬀerence contours above the Fe/W(110) surface in the
[-0.8 V, +0.8 V] bias voltage and [3 ˚A, 10 ˚A] tip-sample distance ranges assuming seven

relative tip-sample magnetization orientations. We ﬁnd that all considered φ angles result

in the appearance of contrast inversions. Close to the surface anticorrugation (∆I < 0)

is observed with the exception of the bias voltage at around -0.4 V for φ angles upto 90

degrees. Farther from the surface two important eﬀects can be seen: (i) the (z, V ) regions

with normal corrugation (∆I > 0) above +0.3 V and below -0.4 V are shrinking with
increasing the φ angle in the [0◦, 90◦] range, and (ii) a (z, V ) region with normal corrugation
opens up centered at -0.2 V upon increasing the φ angle in the [120◦, 180◦] range.

For the understanding of these ﬁndings we recall that the complex interplay of orbital-

dependent and spin-polarization eﬀects determine the STM corrugation character above a

magnetic surface. While the orbitals with m = 0 magnetic quantum number (s, pz, d3z2−r2)
prefer normal corrugation, m (cid:54)= 0 states generally prefer anticorrugation [26, 50]. This
electron orbital picture is modiﬁed by taking the weight of the contributing spin channels to

the spin-polarized electron tunneling in a magnetic STM into account [31]. Thus, based on

the 3D-WKB model, the STM contrast depending on the bias voltage and on the tip-sample

distance can be explained as an interplay of the real-space orbital shapes involved in the

electron tunneling and their corresponding spin-resolved energy-dependent partial PDOS.
The simplest explanation of the STM contrast character can be given for the φ = 90◦ case,
i.e., for perpendicular spin quantization axes of the surface and the tip. This particular setup

surface in seven relative tip-sample magnetization orientations (φ between 0 and 180 degrees in
30◦ step). The sign of ∆I (+ or −) is shown in selected (z, V ) sections, and crossing the ∆I = 0

STM. Note that positive ∆I corresponds to normal, and negative to inverted atomic contrast in

STM images, for a demonstration see Refs. [26, 31].

results in zero spin-polarized contribution to the tunneling current because cos(φ) = 0, and

only orbital shape eﬀects play a role in the tunneling without spin-polarization eﬀects. This is

governed by the orbital-dependent transmission function in Eq.(11). Fig. 1(c) shows that the

d partial PDOS of the Fe/W(110) surface outweighs the s and p partial PDOS in the whole

energy range. Taking d orbitals of the surface and following geometrical considerations, the

leading current contribution is expected from the d3z2−r2 orbital of the underlying Fe atom

and from the dxy orbital from the nearest neighbor Fe atoms when the tip is placed above

the surface top position (I top). On the other hand, the main current contribution above

the surface hollow position (I hollow) is expected from the four nearest neighbor Fe atoms

and their dxz and dyz orbitals close to the surface and d3z2−r2 orbital at larger tip-sample

distances. Since Fig. 1(a) shows that the dxz partial PDOS is the largest above the surface

be larger than I top, and the overall current diﬀerence ∆I = I top − I hollow will be negative
in almost the entire studied (z, V ) range. Two exceptions are (i) close to -0.3 V and close

to the surface, where the overall eﬀect of dxy and d3z2−r2 partial PDOS outweighs that of

dyz, and (ii) above +0.6 V at large tip-sample distance, where the geometry eﬀect of the

is found.

Diﬀerent φ angles than 90◦ result in the occurrence of spin-polarized charge current, and
the above described physical picture is modiﬁed by the contributing spin channels. The
[0◦, 90◦) φ angle range corresponds to the dominance of the so-called ferromagnetic current

Note that with the introduced notations I(φ = 90◦) = (IF + IA)/2, i.e., an equal 0.5-0.5

We ﬁnd that both the shrinking of the (z, V ) regions showing normal corrugation above

of the (z, V ) region with normal corrugation centered at -0.2 V upon increasing the φ angle
in the [120◦, 180◦] range result from the increasing importance of IA, i.e., the mixture of
the sample and tip majority and minority spin contributions. For instance, in the former

case the minority spin dxy PDOS peak of the tip located at 0.5 eV below its Fermi level [see

Fig. 1(d)] plays an important role. The dxy tip orbital prefers normal corrugation due to

its xz and yz nodal planes since above the hollow position the anticorrugating dxz,yz surface

orbitals do not contribute to the current resulting in lower I hollow than I top [26]. On the

with the minority spin PDOS of the iron tip results in the opening of a normally corrugated

(z, V ) region around -0.2 V.

The above ﬁndings clearly demonstrate the tunability of the atomic contrast inversion in

STM images depending on the contributing spin channels and consequently on the relative

tip-sample magnetization orientation.

B. Vector spin transport characteristics

In this section we present a detailed analysis of the calculated STT, its vector components

and their relation to the spin-polarized charge current by varying diﬀerent tunnel junction

parameters, such as the relative tip-sample magnetization orientation, the lateral and vertical

positions of the STM tip and the bias voltage.

Figure 3 shows the magnitude of the STT as a function of the charge current above

two diﬀerent surface sites (top and hollow) of the Fe/W(110) surface. The bias voltage

is ﬁxed at -0.2 V and seven diﬀerent tip magnetization orientations are considered. The

choice of this bias voltage was motivated by the comparability of our calculation results

with the experimental work of Krause et al. [18]. Our ﬁrst ﬁnding is that the torque-current

curves deviate from the linear relationship reported for similar curves of the experimentally

determined modiﬁed activation energy barrier directly related to the STT in Ref. [18]. Our

ﬁnding can be understood as follows. Let us assume that both the charge current and
the STT are exponentially decaying with increasing tip-sample distance z, i.e., I(z) ∝
exp{−κIz} and T (z) ∝ exp{−κT z}. This assumption is validated by ﬁtting exponential
functions to the calculated I(z) and T (z) curves (not shown), and we obtain κI between
2.002 and 2.008 ˚A−1 and κT between 1.666 and 1.918 ˚A−1 depending on the lateral STM
tip position (above top or hollow surface sites) and on the relative tip-sample magnetization

orientation (φ). Note that an exponential z-decay of STT vector components using a free-

be derived. This shows that the linear relationship between the STT and the charge current

is ensured only if κT = κI. To analyze our calculated T (I) functions in more detail, Table I

reports ﬁtted parameters assuming power and linear function forms for T (I). Based on the

coeﬃcients of determination (R2) it is found that the power function ﬁt is almost exclusively
better than the linear ﬁt (the only exception is found for φ = 180◦ above the hollow site).
Thus, based on Table I, we can conclude on the more general power function behavior of

the torque-current curves in Fig. 3. The obtained κT /κI is always found to be smaller than

one, which means that the decay constant of the STT (κT ) is smaller than that of the

charge current (κI), see also the range of explicitly ﬁtted values above. This immediately

implies that the STT eﬃciency [9] (or normalized torque [4]) deﬁned by the T /I ratio can
be enhanced at larger tip-sample distances since T /I ∝ exp{(κI − κT )z}. We return to
this later on. According to Table I we found a variation of κT /κI between 0.831 and 0.954

depending on the lateral STM tip position (above top or hollow surface sites) and on the

relative tip-sample magnetization orientation (φ).

TABLE I: Fitted parameters on the torque-current curves in Fig. 3 assuming power and linear

function forms for T (I). The coeﬃcients of determination (R2) are also reported, which indicate

the quality of the ﬁts.

Although the ﬁtted torque-current curves show a preference of the power function for

16

T (I), it is interesting to compare the obtained slopes of the linear ﬁts with the one reported

in Ref. [18]. Krause et al. calculated a slope of c = 1.5 meV/µA for the charge current

dependence of the modiﬁed activation energy barrier, ∆E(I) = cI. Our ﬁtted c slopes

for T (I) = T0 + cI vary between 1.151 and 5.046 meV/µA, thus these values are found

well in the same order of magnitude as in the experiment. The quantitative diﬀerence can

be attributed to the diﬀerent tip material used, Fe(001) tip in our case and Cr-coated W

tip in the experiment. Although the relative tip-sample magnetization orientation was not

explicitly reported in Ref. [18], based on our results we suggest that the experimental STM
setup corresponds to φ = 0◦ since our obtained c = 1.377 and 2.106 meV/µA values are in
the closest agreement with the experimentally determined c = 1.5 meV/µA.

In Fig. 3 we ﬁnd that the STT is generally larger above the hollow rather than above

the top surface position. This ﬁnding is important in the close-contact regime only since
the visible region of Fig. 3 corresponds to the I ≈ 1-60 nA current range and a tip-sample
distance range of z ≈ 5-3 ˚A. Note that in this z range the charge current at a ﬁxed z position
(and at -0.2 V bias) is larger above the hollow than above the top position, i.e.,
∆I(z,-0.2 V) = I top(z,-0.2 V)−I hollow(z,-0.2 V) < 0, see Fig. 2. Since the STT decays slower
than the charge current (κT /κI < 1), the above explain the generally larger STT above the

hollow surface site. This is, in eﬀect, due to the largest orbital-dependent contributions from

nearest surface atoms at the STM tip position in the 3D-WKB picture.

To get more insight to the STT, we investigate its vector character. Figure 4 shows
calculated STT vectors at -0.2 V bias voltage and 5 ˚A above the top and hollow sites of

the Fe/W(110) surface considering 18 relative tip-sample magnetization orientations. It is

clearly seen that the STT vectors form the lateral surface of two separate cones above the

top and hollow surface sites.

Increasing the tip-sample distance, we ﬁnd that the cones

formed by the φ-dependent STT vectors above the top and hollow sites converge to the
same cone, reaching equivalence above z = 8 ˚A (not shown). These ﬁndings prove that the

STT vectors are highly dependent on the lateral (and vertical) STM tip position even above
clean (defect-free) ferromagnetic surfaces in a certain tip-sample distance regime (3 ˚A < z <
8 ˚A in our case).

For designing real devices using the STT for current induced magnetization switching,

it is ultimately important to maximize the STT eﬃciency. We adopt the deﬁnition of the
STT eﬃciency as reported in Ref. [9]: in-plane torque ratio = |T(cid:107)|/I, out-of-plane torque

ratio = |T⊥|/I. In the following we analyze the STT eﬃciency depending on the tip-sample
distance, the relative tip-sample magnetization orientation and the bias voltage.

Figure 5 shows the tip-sample-distance-dependent in-plane and out-of-plane STT eﬃcien-

cies calculated at -0.2 V bias voltage above two surface positions of the Fe/W(110) surface

in seven relative tip-sample magnetization orientations. We ﬁnd that the z-dependence of

the in-plane and the out-of-plane STT eﬃciencies diﬀers considerably, and the in-plane STT

component is always larger by at least one order of magnitude than the out-of-plane STT

component. This means that the magnitude of the STT is, in eﬀect, determined by the in-

plane component at this bias voltage, similarly found in metallic spin valves [1]. Note that

the order of the φ-dependent curves in Fig. 5(a) corresponds to that of Fig. 3(a), and the

same is true for the order of the φ-dependent curves at small z in Fig. 5(c) in relation to that

of Fig. 3(b) (at large current). We also ﬁnd considerable diﬀerences between the z-dependent

STT eﬃciencies above the top and hollow surface sites of Fe/W(110). The in-plane STT

eﬃciencies (and thus the magnitudes of the STT) converge to the same φ-dependent curves
above z = 8 ˚A for both surface sites. We recover the already mentioned exponentially in-
creasing STT eﬃciency [T /I ∝ exp{(κI − κT )z}] at large tip-sample distances (above z = 8
˚A). Note that in symmetric tunnel junctions an opposite type of z-decay (faster STT than

charge current decay) can occur, which results in an exponentially vanishing STT eﬃciency

as the tip-sample distance (barrier thickness) increases [4]. In our asymmetric STM junc-

tion, we ﬁnd the maximal STT eﬃciency values at the investigated upper boundary of z =
10 ˚A for all considered φ values above the top site and for 0◦ ≤ φ ≤ 90◦ above the hollow
site [Fig. 5(a) and (c)]. Below z = 8 ˚A the z-evolution of the in-plane STT eﬃciencies shows

interesting features. We identify certain z values, where the in-plane STT eﬃciency is in-
sensitive to the tip magnetization orientation. This occurs at z = 3 ˚A above the surface top
site in Fig. 5(a) (see also Fig. 3(a) for the total STT at I ≈ 60 nA) and at z = 4.65 ˚A above
the surface hollow site in Fig. 5(c). Such a φ-independent in-plane STT eﬃciency can be

can be a result from a complex interplay of orbital-dependent transmission and electronic

structure eﬀects. Interestingly, we ﬁnd large STT eﬃciency at small tip-sample distances
as well (for z < 4 ˚A, particularly for 90◦ ≤ φ ≤ 180◦) above the surface hollow site. The
results show that the tip-sample distance minima of the in-plane STT eﬃciency curves have

a clear φ dependence: The minima are shifted to larger z values by increasing φ, i.e., from
z = 3.4 ˚A at φ = 0◦ to z = 4.2 ˚A at φ = 180◦ above the top site and from z = 4 ˚A at φ = 0◦
to z = 5.3 ˚A at φ = 180◦ above the hollow site.

For the out-of-plane STT eﬃciency we ﬁnd that maximal values can be obtained at small
tip-sample distances: The local maximum is found at z = 4.1 ˚A in Fig. 5(b) and at z = 3
˚A in Fig. 5(d). However, there are local minima at z = 6.7 ˚A and z = 3.9 ˚A, respectively,

in the latter case quite close to the local maximum. In contrast to the in-plane STT, the

z-positions of the maxima and minima of the out-of-plane STT eﬃciency do not depend on

φ, and the curves are just scaled by sin(φ) in Fig. 5(b) and 5(d).

Finally, we consider the possibility of tuning the STT eﬃciency by the applied bias voltage

in the tunnel junction. Figure 6 shows in-plane and out-of-plane STT eﬃciency maps 5
˚A above two surface positions of the Fe/W(110) surface as the function of the relative tip-

sample magnetization orientation and the bias voltage. We ﬁnd that the obtained STT

eﬃciency maps are qualitatively similar above both the top and hollow surface sites. This
is also true for the studied z range of [3 ˚A, 10 ˚A] (not shown). Our most important ﬁnding

is that the STT eﬃciencies can be enhanced by about two orders of magnitude by changing

the bias voltage compared to the experimentally used voltage of -0.2 V [18]. We identify
V > 0.4 V and V ≈ −0.8 V bias voltage ranges for highly enhanced STT eﬃciencies.
This also indicates a bias-asymmetry in the favorable torque eﬃciencies as reported in other

asymmetric tunnel junctions [9]. Asymmetric bias dependence of the STT has been reported

earlier [6, 7].

Clearly, our in-plane and out-of-plane STT eﬃciencies diﬀer considerably, particularly
in their φ dependence. While the out-of-plane eﬃciency follows a | sin(φ)| behavior, it is
more complicated for the in-plane eﬃciency [14]. We ﬁnd the largest values in the ranges
of 0◦ < φ < 60◦ and 300◦ < φ < 360◦ for the in-plane STT eﬃciency and in the ranges
of 60◦ < φ < 120◦ and 240◦ < φ < 300◦ for the out-of-plane STT eﬃciency. This also
implies that the ﬁnding (at -0.2 V bias) of at least one order of magnitude less out-of-plane

compared to in-plane STT component is not generally true [2]. Fig. 6 shows that around
0.8 V and close to φ = 90◦ and 270◦ the two STT components are comparable in their
orders of magnitude, though the out-of-plane component is still always smaller by a factor

of about 4-5 than the in-plane component. This is in agreement with earlier works [7, 13].

We ﬁnd that for an antiferromagnetic alignment of the surface and the tip magnetizations
(φ = 180◦) the STT eﬃciencies are not favored. Similar results were reported in Ref. [9]
for a diﬀerent tunnel junction. Note that the STT eﬃciencies reported by Kalitsov et al.
with maximal values of about 0.4 /2e ≈ 0.82 meV/µA are much smaller than found in our
W(110)/Fe(110)/Vac/Fe(001) STM junction.

geometric eﬀect) and the bias-voltage-dependent (determined by mostly electronic structure

eﬀect) STT eﬃciencies are due to the complex interplay of the orbital-dependent tunneling

(determined by the geometry of the STM junction) and the involved spin-polarized elec-

tronic structures of the sample surface and the STM tip. We anticipate that most of the

reported eﬀects can generally be found and utilized in other magnetic STM junctions as well.

Moreover, we suggest that by changing the tip material the bias-dependent STT eﬃciencies

could be further enhanced. This can be a topic of future research.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced a method for a combined calculation of charge and vector spin trans-

port of elastically tunneling electrons in magnetic scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

The method is based on the three-dimensional Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (3D-WKB) ap-

proach combined with electronic structure calculations using ﬁrst principles density func-

tional theory. Employing the model, we have analyzed the STM contrast inversion of the

charge current above the Fe/W(110) surface depending on the bias voltage, tip-sample dis-

tance and relative magnetization orientation between the sample and an iron tip. We have

demonstrated the tunability of the atomic contrast inversion in STM images depending on

the contributing spin channels. For the spin transfer torque (STT) vector we have found

that its in-plane component is generally larger than the out-of-plane component. Our results

suggest that the torque-current relationship in magnetic STM junctions follows the power

law rather than a linear function. Consequently, we have shown that the ratio between the

STT and the spin-polarized charge current is not constant, and more importantly, it can

be tuned by the bias voltage, tip-sample distance and magnetization rotation. We found

that the STT eﬃciency can be enhanced by about two orders of magnitude by selecting a

proper bias voltage. Thus, we demonstrated the possible enhancement of the STT eﬃciency

in magnetic STM junctions, which can be exploited in technological applications. We dis-

cussed our results in view of the indirect measurement of the STT above the Fe/W(110)

surface reported by Krause et al.

[18]. Our presented work is expected to inspire future

research on high resolution vector spin transport characteristics in magnetic STM junctions.
