We report on the study of terahertz radiation induced MIRO-like oscillations of magneto-resistivity
in GaAs heterostructures. Our experiments provide an answer on two most intriguing questions –
eﬀect of radiation helicity and the role of the edges – yielding crucial information for understanding
of the MIRO origin. Moreover, we demonstrate that the range of materials exhibiting radiation-
induced magneto-oscillations can be largely extended by using high-frequency radiation.

INTRODUCTION

One of the most stunning phenomena discovered in the
past decade in two dimensional electron systems (2DES)
is microwave (MW) induced magneto-resistance oscilla-
tions (MIRO) [1–7], reviewed, e.g., in [8]. These oscilla-
tions are, as Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdH), peri-
odic on a 1/B scale, but occur at lower magnetic ﬁelds
and show much weaker temperature dependence. Phe-
nomenologically, they are very similar to Weiss oscilla-
tions [9], which reﬂect the commensurability between the
cyclotron orbit radius and the period of a periodic po-
tential. MIRO by contrast, reﬂect the commensurability
between the MW photon energy 2πf and the cyclotron
energy ωc. Here,  is the reduced Planck constant, f
the MW and ωc the cyclotron frequencies. In extremely
clean samples the minima of the MIRO develop into zero
resistance states [3–5] which are explained [10] in terms
of an instability of the system and formation of current
domains, occurring when the conductivity becomes neg-
ative under MW irradiation (see also [8, 11, 12]).

In spite of numerous experiments and signiﬁcant ad-
vances in their theoretical understanding, there is still
no commonly accepted microscopic description of the
eﬀect [13, 14] and the ongoing MIRO investigations re-
main challenging [15–20]. Consequently new materials
have been studied [21–24] and new theoretical models
have been put forward [25–29]. To the most pressing is-
sues which need to be clariﬁed experimentally and which
might help to diﬀerentiate between the diﬀerent mod-
els belong the MIRO polarization dependence and the
“bulk” or “edge” nature of the eﬀect.

So far the majority of experimental work in this direc-
tion has been done in the MW regime (1-350 GHz) and
there are only a few reports on MIRO excited at terahertz
(THz) frequencies [30–32]. Here we report on the obser-
vation of pronounced MIRO-like oscillations induced by
THz radiation, i.e. in the frequency regime between 0.7
and 2 THz. We exploit the speciﬁc advantages of THz

ity whereas in the MW range ultra-high mobility samples
are crucially needed for this type of experiments.

We study the radiation induced oscillations in Al-
GaAs/GaAs quantum wells (QW) of 10 or 12.5 nm thick-
ness. While THz MIRO-like oscillations have been ob-
served in Hall bar samples [31]
in this work we used
Corbino disk samples, which measure directly σxx. The
inner, ri, and outer radius, ro, of the gold-germanium
contacts and samples’ transport parameters are given in
Table I, see also Suppl. Materials. The eﬀect of THz radi-
ation on conductivity σxx was studied in the temperature
range from T = 2.5 K to about 20 K. The MIRO-like ef-
fect is most pronounced after the cooled samples have
been exposed to room light, but the eﬀect is also present
for samples kept in the dark. All data shown here were
taken after illuminating the samples.

The THz experiments were performed using continu-
ous wave (cw) CH2O2 and CH2F2 lasers [33–35] operat-
ing at frequencies f = 0.69 and 1.63 THz, respectively.
The power, P , being of the order of 10 mW at the sam-
ple surface, has been controlled by pyroelectric detectors.
The radiation at normal incidence is focused onto a spot
size of about 3.4 mm diameter. The beam has an al-
most Gaussian proﬁle, measured by a pyroelectric cam-
era [36, 37]. Right- and left-handed circularly polarized
radiation is obtained by a λ/4 quartz plate [38, 39]. The
inset in Fig. 1(b) sketches the set-up. Applying a bias
voltage, Udc = 50 mV, and measuring the voltage U on
the load resistor RL = 50 Ohm we obtained the radiation
induced change of the sample conductivity ∆σxx ∝ U .
Irradiating the samples with THz radiation and sweep-
ing the magnetic ﬁeld B results in conductivity oscil-
lations ∆σxx starting already at |B| ∼ 0.1 T. Figure 1
shows the data for sample #A and f = 0.69 THz. The os-
cillations reﬂect two 1/B periodicities: one at low B cor-
responding to the MIRO-like oscillations and the other,
at higher ﬁelds |B| ∼ 1 T, corresponding to SdH oscilla-
tions. While the former oscillations are detected up to
temperatures of about 20 K the latter are observed at
substantially lower temperatures only. The oscillations
are observed for a large number of structures with mo-
bilities between µ = 1.8 × 106 and 1.5 × 105 cm2/Vs and
with electron densities from ne = 4 to 24 × 1011 cm−2.

Figure 2 shows ∆σxx normalized to the dark conductiv-
ity, ∆σxx/σxx, for diﬀerent samples. The data clearly
show that the oscillations are periodic in ǫ = ω/ωc with
ω = 2πf and exhibit extrema at ǫ = ǫN ± 1/4, where
ǫN ≃ N = 1, 2, 3 . . . denote the position of the nodes [40]
and +(−) corresponds to minima (maxima). Here, the
position of the cyclotron resonance (CR) at ω = ωc has
been obtained from the transmission experiments dis-
played in the inset of Fig. 1 (a). The overall behavior of
the observed 1/B–oscillations including the exponential
damping at low B and the 1/4-shift of the minima and
maxima from the nodes corresponds to the well known
MIRO eﬀects as is further discussed below. Strikingly,
Figs. 1 and 2 reveal that the oscillation amplitudes de-
pend only weakly on the radiation helicity and some sam-
ples (#B and #D) show nearly no helicity dependence.
By contrast, transmission, displayed in the inset in Fig. 1
(a), strongly depends on helicity. CR for positive B oc-

versa. Indeed, in agreement with the theory of CR [41],
the transmitted power drops nearly to zero for the cy-
clotron resonance active conﬁguration (CRA, red data in
the inset), whereas the signal for the opposite helicity
(blue data), i.e. for the inactive conﬁguration (CRI), is
almost B-independent. Active and inactive helicity in-
terchange for negative magnetic ﬁelds (not shown). Note
that the detected polarization behavior and the shape of
transmittance minimum are well ﬁtted by taking multiple
reﬂections in the substrate and superradiant decay into
account [42–45], see solid lines in the inset of Fig. 1 (a)
and Suppl. Materials. To demonstrate that the weak de-
pendence of the MIRO-like oscillations on the radiation
helicity is not caused by saturation eﬀects we measured
∆σxx at diﬀerent levels of radiation intensity. These data
demonstrate that the signals depend linearly on the radi-
ation intensity and reducing the intensity by an order of
magnitude does not change the ratio between CRA and
CRI signals for all values of ω/ωc. The overall same re-
sults are obtained for the higher frequency f = 1.63 THz.
The only diﬀerences are the detected signal magnitude
and rescaled B−ﬁeld positions of CR and oscillations.

The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are obtained for
Corbino discs with an outer diameter 3 mm, thus being of
the order of the laser spot size. To exclude possible eﬀects
stemming from illumination of the contacts’ edges we car-
ried out measurements on discs with 8.5 mm diameter,
i.e. signiﬁcantly larger than the spot size. These sam-
ples are indicated by a subscript L in the sample index.
Figure 3 (a) and (b) show that the oscillations can be ef-
ﬁciently excited without illuminating the contacts. We
measured the photoconductivity (PC) while illuminating
the sample through a square-shaped hole in a metal mask
covering the contacts. The metal ﬁlm was mounted at a
distance of about 1 mm from the sample surface in a way

that only the 2DES was illuminated, see inset in Fig. 3(a).
To prove that the boundaries of the Corbino electrodes do
not contribute to the PC signal we removed a part of the
metal screen and scanned the beam across the edge, see
inset in Fig. 3(c). Figure 3(c) shows that the signal de-
creases as the beam approaches the edge, demonstrating
that the oscillation amplitude just follows the decrease in
absorbed radiation power, probed via the transmission si-
multaneously with the PC signal. The data clearly show
that the edges do not contribute to the oscillations and,
consequently, ponderomotive forces excited by edge illu-
mination [28] as well as radiation-induced modiﬁcation
of the edge transport [29] are not essential for MIRO
generation, at least in the THz regime. Importantly, the
polarization dependence of the oscillations remains weak
for any position of the laser spot including both geome-
tries, where the contacts are avoided and where the beam
is focused on the edge. This is illustrated in Fig. 4, where
the ratios of the oscillation amplitude for CRA and CRI
conﬁgurations are shown as a function of ω/ωc.
In all
cases and especially for low oscillation indices the ex-
perimental CRA/CRI ratio is always much smaller than
the calculated ones, shown for diﬀerent radiative decay
Γ (discussed below) in Fig. 4. The ﬁnding that the THz
induced oscillations depend only weakly on helicity is in
line with results of Smet et al., who examined MIROs at
MW frequencies [7].

Now we discuss the results within the most commonly
used theoretical approaches to explain MIRO, i.e., the
inelastic [6, 46, 47] and the displacement [48–52] mech-
anisms, which ascribe the magneto-oscillations of the
PC to radiation-assisted scattering between disorder-
broadened Landau levels. This theory is a nonequilib-

rium extension of linear transport theory in high Landau
levels [53], and accounts for both, real-space displace-
ments of electron orbits in individual photon-assisted
scattering events (displacement contribution) and as-
sociated nonequilibrium occupation of electronic states
within the disorder-broadened Landau levels (inelastic
contribution). Within this theory the conductivity os-
cillation are given by [54]

∆σxx/σxx = −ǫAǫ sin(2πǫ) exp(−αǫ),

comes B-independent for ǫ = ω/ωc ≫ 1. Fitting
the low-B data in Fig. 2(a) using Eq. (1) with constant
A∞ = Aǫ|ǫ→∞ reveals that the experimental oscillation
amplitude, Aexp
∞ = 0.056, agree well with the theoretical
predictions for the inelastic mechanism [47], Ath
∞ ∼ 0.04,
see [40] and Suppl. Materials for details. This shows,
e/ω4 dependence
in particular, that ∆σxx follows the n3
predicted for a dominant inelastic mechanism. We em-
phasize that all parameters required for this compari-
son are extracted from the independent measurements
of transmission and magneto-transport.
In accordance
with Eq. (1), the number of resolved oscillations for all
samples in Fig. 2 is roughly equal to ωτq/2. Here τq are
taken from the analysis of SdH oscillations, see Table I.
This highlights the important role of τq in the appear-
ance of oscillations and explains why at THz frequencies
they can be observed in samples with relatively low mo-
bility. Thus, the THz regime opens perspectives for the
observation of MIRO in broader range of materials.

While the inelastic mechanism of MIRO describes the
experimental ﬁndings for large ω/ωc quite well it can not
explain the weak polarization dependence measured for
ω/ωc ≤ 5.
In theory, the polarization dependence of
∆σxx follows the absorbance K = σ(±)
±/2, where
σ(±)
xx (ω) is the dissipative part of the linear dynamic con-
ductivity, E± is the amplitude of the screened radiation
ﬁeld acting on the electrons, and +(−) labels the CRI
(CRA) circular polarization. Although the magneto-
oscillations in ∆σxx are of quantum origin, their polar-
ization dependence stems from Drude theory and reﬂects
the classical dynamics of 2DES in crossed magnetic ﬁeld
B and electric ﬁeld of the THz wave, yielding [41]

In order to relate E±, acting on the electrons in 2DES,
to the electric ﬁeld E(0)
± of the incoming wave, one needs
to take into account both the dynamical screening by the
2DES and multiple reﬂections within the dielectric sub-
strate (Fabry-Perot interference). The former is domi-
nated by the Hall part σ(±)
xy (ω) of the dynamic conduc-
tivity and is described by the superradiant decay rate

Γ = e2ne/2ωǫ0mc ≫ γ [42–45]. The eﬀect of the dynam-
ical screening is most simply expressed in the case of con-
structive Fabry-Perot interference [55]: the absorbance
still has the form of Eq. (2) where E± get replaced by
E(0)
± and γ by (Γ + γ). Then, since Γ ≫ γ, the ratio
of CRA and CRI absorption coeﬃcient and oscillation
amplitude is given by

Note that the value of Γ is fully determined by ne and m
known precisely from independent measurements. Tak-
ing multiple reﬂections into account (see Suppl. Mate-
rial), the transmission data for CRA and CRI polariza-
tion can be perfectly ﬁtted using the above expression
for Γ, see inset in Fig. 1(a). In Figure 4 we present the
ratio (3) calculated for diﬀerent samples. The small-
est ACRA
value is obtained for the largest Γ, in
our case Γ = 0.36 for sample #D with the largest
carrier density ne = 2.4 × 1012 cm−2, see dashed line
in Fig. 4. Clearly, for low harmonics ω/ωc ≤ 5, the
theoretical predictions for ACRA
strongly deviate
from the experimental data in Fig. 4. Unreasonably high
values of Γ ≥ 1.5 would be needed to match experi-
ment. For higher harmonics, however, i.e., for ω/ωc & 5,

detailed in the Suppl. Material, the data in this low-B

To summarize, our experiments provide clear evidence
that MIRO-like oscillations in the THz regime are ex-
cited in the “bulk” of 2DES and not at contacts/sample
boundaries. In the THz range they are also observed at
much lower mobilities of the 2DES as compared to the
MW regime suggesting that they appear at ω & τ −1
. Al-
though at high harmonics of the cyclotron resonance the
observed MIRO-like oscillations are well described by the
inelastic mechanism [47], their polarization dependence
at low harmonics is at odds with any existing theoretical
description of MIRO.

tremely challenging in the microwave range of frequencies
used in MIRO experiments and, so far, was only realized
using a unique quasi-optical set-up in Ref. [1]. By con-
trast, in the terahertz range one has an opportunity to
implement well-deﬁned focused laser beams of incoming
radiation. After a simple analysis of the supplementary
transmission data similar to that presented in Refs. [2–5],
one can determine the screened terahertz ﬁeld E± acting
on electrons in the bulk of the 2DES. This knowledge, in
turn, enables (i) a quantitative comparison of the experi-
mental results for MIRO-like oscillations with theoretical
predictions and (ii) a systematic comparison of the data
obtained from diﬀerent samples with varying density and
transport parameters.

To relate the screening and transmission, we consider
a circularly polarized wave normally incident from z < 0
upon a sample which occupies 0 < z < w and contains
a 2DES at z = d, see Fig. 2. In our samples the 2DES
is located close to the interface at z = 0, such that d ≪
1/nk, which allows us to set d = 0. Here k = ω/c is
the wave vector in vacuum and n = 3.6 is the refraction
index of the GaAs substrate. By contrast, the optical
path φ = nkw across the whole sample including the
substrate is large, φ ≫ 1, which necessitates the account
for multiple reﬂections between the dielectric interfaces
(Fabry-Perot interference).

All samples were characterized using linear magneto-
transport measurements both before and after illumina-
tion by the room light. Standard lock-in technique has
been applied with the excitation ac current of 1-100 nA
and frequency of 12 Hz. The sheet density ns and the
quantum lifetime τq in Table I of the main text were
extracted from data obtained in the two-point Corbino
geometry. The mobility µ from Corbino measurements is
not reliable due to possible signiﬁcant contribution of the
contact resistance in the vicinity of zero magnetic ﬁeld.
For this reason we additionally conducted standard four-
point Van der Pauw measurements for each GaAs wafer
under investigation and extracted the values of µ and τp
(listed in Table I of the main text) from the values of
sheet resistance ρxx.

An example of measured dependence of the magne-
toresistance (inverse conductance) R(B) in the Corbino
geometry for two values of temperature T is shown in
the Fig. 1(a). At T = 15 K one observes only classi-
cal parabolic magnetoresistance. The curve measured
at T = 1.9 K shows similar behavior at low mag-
netic ﬁelds with the SdH oscillations superimposed at
B > 0.3 T. The electron sheet density was obtained
from the periodicity of SdH oscillations in the reciprocal
magnetic ﬁeld assuming spin-degenerated Landau levels.
The values of the quantum life time τq were extracted
using the Lifshits-Kosevich (LK) formula from the ﬁt-
ting of the low-ﬁeld SdH oscillations measured at low
T , see Fig. 1(b). For each R(B) trace we calculated
the monotonous part hR(B)i by smoothing the original
curve. Next, we calculated the relative oscillatory signal
δr(B) = [R(B)−hR(B)i]/hR(B)i which was ﬁtted using
the LK formula in the range |δr(B)| < 0.3 where the LK
formula is applicable [B < 0.5 T in Fig. 1(b)].

FIG. 2: Illustration of the model used to relate the dynamic
screening and transmission. Horizontal arrows indicate the
partial reﬂected/transmitted THz waves, vertical solid lines
at z = 0 and z = w – the front and back interfaces of the
sample (dielectric slab with the refractive index n = 3.6) with
vacuum, dashed vertical line at z = d ≪ 1/nk – the position
of the 2DES characterized by the dynamic conductivity ˆσ(ω).
The amplitudes r and t are the reﬂectance and transmittance
amplitudes, while the amplitude s = sr + sl = 1 + r describes
the reduction of screened terahertz ﬁeld in the plane of 2DES
with respect to the incident ﬁeld.

The electric ﬁeld of the circularly-polarized incident

wave is given by

Ei = EiRe e±eikz−iωt,

(1)

where the complex vectors √2e± = ex ± iey describe
the helicity of the wave. The structure is modeled as
a dielectric slab with the refraction coeﬃcient n ≃ 3.6
at 0 < z < w placed in vacuum and a conducting
plane at z = d characterized by the dynamic conduc-
tivity ˆσ(ω). Assuming isotropic transport in the 2DES,
σ(±)
xx (ω) = σ(±)
xy (ω), one ﬁnds
that the dynamic conductivity tensor ˆσ(ω) is diagonal in
the chiral basis,

When the time-reversal symmetry is broken, σxy 6= 0,
the polarization state of the incoming and transmit-
ted/reﬂected waves is in general diﬀerent. Still, the ax-
ial symmetry for the normally incident circularly po-
larized wave and isotropic 2DES is preserved, there-
fore the individual circular components ∝ e+ and e−
do not mix and can be considered independently. We
write down the electric ﬁeld in the whole space as
E(z, t) = EiRe e±a(z)e−iωt, with a(z) = eikz + re−ikz
at z < 0, a(z) = sreikz + sle−ikz at 0 < z < w, and
a(z) = te−ik(z−w) at z > w, see Fig. 2. Here t and r
are the transmittance and reﬂectance amplitudes, while
s = sr + sl gives the amplitude E± of the screened ﬁeld
Re e±E±e−iωt = EiRe e±se−iωt acting on electrons in
the 2DES. Indices ± of the amplitudes a, t, s, r are
suppressed for better readability.

(8)

where ˜σ± = σ±/2ǫ0c (in Gaussian units, ˜σ± = 2πσ±/c).
The screened ﬁeld in the 2DES plane is given by

s = 1 + r = t(cos φ − in−1 sin φ).

(9)

Note that the helicity dependence in t, r and s is solely
due to σ± entering Eqs. (8) and (2).

As discussed below, for our purposes here it is suﬃcient
to describe the ac conduction in the 2DES within the
classical Drude approximation. The Drude expression
for the ac conductivity,

σ± =

(10)

immediately follows from the Drude equation for the drift
velocity

(∂t + 1/τp)v = −e/m(E + v × B).

(11)

This equation describes the classical dynamics of an elec-
tron subjected to crossed ac electric ﬁeld E and con-
stant magnetic ﬁeld B in the presence of a damping force
−mv/τp associated with scattering by impurities. Using
Eq. (10), we represent the dimensionless conductivity ˜σ

With known parameters Γ and γ determined from the
electron density ne and mobility µ, ﬁtting of the B-
dependence of transmission data using Eq. (15) provides
the interference parameter φ = nkw (up to an irrele-
vant integer part of φ/π) and the eﬀective mass entering
ωc/ω = B/Bcr. For γ ≪ Γ . 1, the position of the
cyclotron resonance Bcr = mω/e coincides with the min-
imum in transmission for the CRA polarization. In the
example shown in Fig. 1 of the main text for the sample
#A (ne = 1.2 × 1012 cm−2 and µ = 82 × 104 cm2/V s
corresponding to Γ = 0.19 and γ = 0.0065) this proce-
dure gives φ/π = −0.04 and Bcr = 1.88 T. Note a precise
agreement for both CRA and CRI polarizations obtained
in a single scan including both positive and negative B.
Using the relation (9), with known T± and the inter-
ference parameter φ one readily determines the intensity
|E±|2 of the screened terahertz ﬁeld acting on 2D elec-
trons relative to the intensity of the incoming wave,

|E±|2/E2

i = |s±|2 = T±(cos2 φ + n−2 sin2 φ).

(16)

This knowledge, in turn, enables a quantitative compar-
ison of experimental data with theoretical predictions.
To illustrate the importance of the interference eﬀects,
we address the range of magnetic ﬁeld |ωc| ≪ ω where
y entering Eq. (15) is close to unity irrespective of the
polarization of the wave. For relevant γ, Γ ≪ 1, in
this limit the constructive interference (cos2 φ = 1) pro-
duces T± = |E±|2/E2
i = 1, while the destructive in-
terference (sin2 φ = 1) yields a reduced value of T± =
4n2/(n2 + 1)2 ≃ 0.27 and much stronger reduction of
i = 4/(n2 + 1)2 ≃ 0.02. This shows that with-
|E±|2/E2
out knowledge of φ no quantitative comparison of exper-
iment with theory, as well as comparison of experimental
results obtained from diﬀerent samples can be made as

long as the magnitude of the MIRO eﬀect is concerned.

(18)

[with the screening factor |s±|2 given by Eq. (16)]. The
quantum scattering time τq determines the width of Lan-
dau levels, and the factor η = ηin + ηdis contains the
mechanism-speciﬁc parameters of the 2DES. Namely, the
inelastic contribution,

ηin =

(19)

includes the rate of inelastic electron-electron collisions

tic scattering. The displacement contribution is highly
sensitive to the correlation properties of disorder and ob-
tains the maximum value ηdis = 3/2 when the momen-
tum relaxation is dominated by large angle scattering

from short-range impurities. The exponential damping
of oscillations in Eq. (17) corresponds to the regime of
overlapping Landau levels relevant to our current experi-
ments. Three amplitude factors in Eq. (17) combine into

Helicity dependence. One immediately observes that
the polarization dependence in Eq. (17) is the same as
in the classical Drude absorption coeﬃcient, given by
K = σ(±)
xx (ω)|E±|2/2, see Eqs. (10) and (16). The
reason is that magnetooscillations in both mechanisms
originate from the photon-assisted transitions between
disorder-broadened Landau levels. While being quantum
in nature, they include matrix elements of optical tran-
sitions reﬂecting the classical dynamics in crossed ﬁelds
described by Eq. (11). According to Eqs. (15), (16), and
(18), the minimum ratio of the MIRO-like signal for CRA
and CRI polarizations is expected in the case of construc-
tive interference, when

S± =

(Γ + γ)2 + (1 ± ωc/ω)2 ,

cos2 φ = 1.

(20)

Assuming for deﬁniteness ωc > 0 and taking into account
that γ ≪ Γ, we obtain for this ratio the expression quoted
in the main text:

Figure 4 in the main text demonstrates a striking dis-
agreement between the experimental data showing weak
helicity dependence of MIRO-like oscillations and the-
ory (21) predicting much stronger oscillations near the
lowest harmonics ω/ωc = 1, 2, 3 for the active circu-
lar polarization. Even with the largest Γ ≃ 0.36 real-
ized in the sample #D with the highest electron density
ne = 2.4 × 1012 cm−2, this ratio at ω/ωc ∼ 1, 2, 3 is
by far larger than that observed in the experiment. In
samples with lower density or diﬀerent values of φ, the
theoretical ratio ACRA
can only increase. For in-
stance, in the opposite case of destructive interference the
width Γ + γ entering Eq. (20) is replaced with consider-
ably smaller value κΓ + γ, where κ = 2/(n2 + 1) ≃ 0.14,

Near higher harmonics, at ω ≫ |ωc|, oscillations be-
come polarization-independent in both theory and ex-
periment. With the interference parameter φ extracted
from the transmission data, for the corresponding low-B
tail of ∆σxx one can perform a quantitative comparison
of theory and experiment. Such analysis, presented be-
low, shows that other theoretical predictions including
the magnitude of oscillations are in good agreement with
our data, which makes the polarization puzzle even more
dramatic.

where ǫ = ω/ωc = Bcr/B and a phenomenological con-
stant ǫ0 introduced to account for an additional phase
shift absent in theory. This ﬁt provides Bcr = 1.84 T
consistent with the value Bcr = 1.88 T extracted from
the transmission data, the phase shift ǫ0 = −0.09, the
damping parameter α = 2π/ωτq = 0.97, and the am-
plitude of oscillations Aexp
∞ = 0.056. Note that similar
analysis for other samples yields a small phase shift ǫ0
of varying sign and magnitude, see Table I. Therefore,
we believe that ﬁnite |ǫ0| ≪ 1 has an instrumental origin
and should not be regarded as conﬂicting with the well
established position of the nodes, ǫ0 = 0, reported earlier
for the microwave range of frequencies [7].

Figures 3 and 4 illustrate that the ﬁtting procedure is
reliable in spite of several ﬁtting parameters. In Fig. 3,
we extract the B-positions of the minima and maxima of
oscillations near diﬀerent harmonics of the CR (integer
ω/ωc = N = 3, 4, 5,··· ); the inverted values of ex-
tracted B-positions are plotted against N . They fall on
straight lines with the slope Bcr = 1.84 T thus conﬁrming
strict 1/B-periodicity of oscillations. The median crosses
the ǫ-axis at ǫ0 = −0.09 while both theory and previ-
ous MIRO measurements yield ǫ0 = 0, corresponding to
∆σxx ∝ − sin(2πBcr/B). The value of the additional
phase ǫ0 = −0.09 is not consistent with measurements
on other samples and should be disregarded. Note that
the relative phase shift between minima and maxima (the
horizontal distance between the solid lines in Fig. 3) is
exactly 1/2 as expected in the regime of exponentially
damped oscillations. The accuracy of the exponential
damping at low B is further illustrated in Fig. 4, where
oscillations are multiplied by ǫ−1 exp(αǫ) with α = 0.97
extracted from the ﬁtting. We mention that the value
of τq corresponding to α = 0.97 is about 3 times shorter
than the value extracted from the SdH oscillations in the
same sample at lower temperature, see also Ref. [8]. In
the microwave range, by contrast, τq extracted from the
low-B damping of MIRO is usually found to be larger
than τq obtained from the SdH oscillations. It was at-
tributed to long-range potential ﬂuctuations which lead
to an additional damping of the SdH oscillations but do
not modify the MIRO amplitude [7].

On the other hand, the amplitude A∞ can be esti-

mated using Eq. (17), which gives

FIG. 3: The inverted values of the B-positions corresponding
to the minima and maxima of oscillations for sample #A at
T = 4.2 K near diﬀerent harmonics of the CR (integer ω/ωc =
N = 3, 4, 5, · · · ) plotted against ω/ωc = Bcr/B. The data
points fall on straight lines with the slope Bcr = 1.84 T. The
median line, marking the positions of the nodes, crosses the
horizontal axis at ǫ0 = −0.09 instead of ǫ0 = 0 expected from
theory and previous MIRO measurements. At the same time,
the horizonal distance between the lines through the minima
and maxima is 1/2 which reproduces the 1/4 phase shift of the
minima and maxima reported before. The ﬁtting procedure
involving four parameters Bcr, ǫ0, α, and A∞ is nevertheless
reliable since many oscillation periods are resolved, see also
Fig. 4.

TABLE I: Parameters of the samples (Bcr, ǫ0, α, and Aexp
∞ )
extracted from ﬁtting of oscillations measured on diﬀerent
samples to Eq. (23). The theoretical value Ath
∞ is calculated
using Eq. (17), with the interference parameter φ extracted
from the transmission data. Due to small number of re-
solved oscillations, the parameter Aexp
∞ could not be reliably
extracted for the sample #C.

Here we took into account that for φ = −0.04 extracted
from the transmission data for #A (very close to the con-
structive interference condition, cos2 φ = 0.985) and for
Γ = 0.19 the polarization factor S∞ = S±|ω≫ωc is close
to unity. In other words, the screened terahertz ﬁeld E±
away from the cyclotron resonance here is almost iden-
tical to the incident ﬁeld Ei of the wave. The electric
ﬁeld in the center of the 10 mW Gaussian beam with the
half-width r0 = 1.7 mm at half-maximum is 7.6 V/cm,
which gives the average intensity across the sample area
i i = 45 V2/cm2. With T = 4.2 K and m = 0.074 m0
hE2
corresponding to Bcr = 1.84 T extracted from the pe-
riod of oscillations, Eq. (19) gives ηin ≃ 12, therefore the
displacement contribution ηdis ≤ 3/2 can be neglected.
Given the accuracy of the above estimate, the result-
ing amplitude of oscillations, Ath
∞ ∼ 0.04, coincides with
the value Aexp
∞ = 0.056 extracted from the experimental
data.

Similar ﬁtting using Eq. (23) and theoretical estimates
using Eq. (17) combined with the analysis of the trans-
mission data were performed for other samples. The re-
sults are presented in Table I. A precise determination
of the dependence on the electron mobility, density, and
temperature, and on radiation power and frequency re-
quires collection of additional data and further reﬁne-
ment of the measurement techniques, and is relegated to
future work.

FIG. 4: The ω/ωc-dependence of the relative magnetooscilla-
tions ∆σxx/σxx with removed smooth background when mul-
tiplied by ǫ−1 exp(αǫ) with α = 0.97 obtained from the ﬁt to
Eq. (23). This plot illustrates the accuracy of the ﬁt and qual-
ity of the data at large harmonics of the CR (ǫ = ω/ωc ≫ 1).
In samples where smaller number of oscillations is resolved,
the accuracy of the ﬁt is reduced. It is still suﬃcient to demon-
strate an overall agreement of the magnitude of oscillations
with theoretical predictions, see Table I.
