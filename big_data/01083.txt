Abstract.
Intrinsically explosive growth of a ballooning ﬁnger is demonstrated in
nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic calculations of high-β disruptions in tokamaks. The
explosive ﬁnger is formed by an ideally unstable n = 1 mode, dominated by an
m/n = 2/1 component. The quadrupole geometry of the 2/1 perturbed pressure
ﬁeld provides a generic mechanism for the formation of the initial ballooning ﬁnger
and its subsequent transition from exponential to explosive growth, without relying
on secondary processes. The explosive ejection of the hot plasma from the core and
stochastization of the magnetic ﬁeld occur in Alfv´enic time scales, accounting for the
extremely fast growth of the precursor oscillations and the rapidity of the thermal
quench in some high-β disruptions.

Role of explosive instabilities in high-β disruptions in tokamaks

Tokamak plasmas operate within imperfectly-deﬁned operational boundaries.
Accidental or deliberate crossing of these boundaries generally leads to a sudden loss
of conﬁnement: the thermal energy content of the plasma is lost on sub-millisecond
time scales (thermal quench), followed by a somewhat slower (ms time scale) loss of
poloidal magnetic energy (current quench) (see, for example, Wesson[1], Sect. 7.7, for a
basic discussion, and Hender[2] for more recent developments). The energy lost from the
plasma invariably ends up on plasma facing components such as the ﬁrst wall or divertor
tiles. This sudden energy ﬂux, and the forces generated on the surrounding structures
by currents that directly couple to them or are inductively induced during the current
quench, pose a signiﬁcant threat to the structural integrity of the device[3, 4]. Hence,
understanding disruptions, and their prevention or mitigation continue to be very active
research areas in magnetic fusion.

Causes of disruptions in tokamaks are generally divided into four major categories.
(i) Density-limit disruptions are caused by plasma density that exceeds a mostly
experimentally-deﬁned “Greenwald limit,” nGW [5].
(ii) Current-limit disruptions are
caused by a macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability when the plasma
current Ip is too high and results in an edge safety factor that is too low, qe < 2[6, 7].
Here qe = aBt/RBp (in cylindrical geometry) where Bp, Bt are the poloidal and toroidal
ﬁeld strengths, respectively, and a, R are the minor and major radii of the torus. (iii) β-
limit disruptions result when the plasma pressure is too high, typically represented as a
limit on the normalized (dimensional) quantity βN = β(aBt)/Ip, where β = 2µ0 (cid:104)p(cid:105) /B2
is the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure, and (cid:104)..(cid:105) represents a volume
average. (iv) In the last category are vertical displacement events (VDE’s) that result
from a loss of positional control that brings the plasma in contact with the material
structures around it (see, for example, Granetz[8]). All disruptive events tend to be
accompanied by an eventual loss of vertical control; thus, a VDE may be the cause or
result of a disruption due to other reasons.

Fusion power density PF depends quadratically on the electron density ne. Since
the magnetic ﬁeld strength is generally limited by engineering concerns, high fusion
power requires high β values (PF ∝ β2), thus making β-limit disruptions particularly
important for present-day tokamaks and the next step device ITER.

Some disruptions at high-β tend to have very fast-growing precursors or no
discernible precursors at all[9, 10]. When they are present, the precursor oscillations,
for example on the edge magnetic ﬁeld signals, precede the thermal quench typically
by less than a millisecond; time evolution of the signals suggests a mode growing at
least exponentially and possibly explosively (faster than exponentially) well into the
nonlinear regime.

Hastie,

in the context of sawtooth oscillations[11], and Callen,

for high-β
disruptions[12], showed that an ideal MHD mode going through its marginal point
as the plasma β increases linearly due to external heating may grow as exp (t/τ )3/2,
thus providing a plausible explanation for the short time-scale of the precursors.
In
both works, the characteristic time τ ∝ (τ 2
Aτh)1/3 is a geometric mean of the MHD (τA)

and heating (τh) time scales. Under these conditions, faster than exponential growth
of an ideal n = 1 mode was conﬁrmed in numerical simulations of a particular DIII-D
disruption (see, for example, [13]) using the NIMROD code[14]. However, this simulation
seems to have used only the n = 0, 1 modes in the toroidal Fourier expansions; thus,
it is only a “quasi-linear,” not a proper nonlinear calculation, which would require the
presence of higher harmonics of the n = 1 mode. In addition, this particular path to
explosive growth was shown to be implausible, requiring an unrealistically small initial
perturbation amplitude to generate Alfv´enic growth, due to the vast separation in time
scales τA and τh[15].

Some characteristics of the actual MHD modes possibly involved in high-β
disruptions were studied by Park[16] and Kleva[17, 18]. In the former a high pressure
front produced by a non-resonant m/n = 1/1 mode (the quasi-interchange mode[19, 20])
was shown to be unstable to high-n ballooning modes, which nonlinearly lead to a
disruption. Kleva’s work relied on resistive ballooning modes or their collisionless
analogue and was challenged[21] as being not relevant much below the ideal ballooning
stability limit (see also [22]).

In this Letter, we show computationally that the ideal m/n = 2/1 mode, because of
its unique geometric characteristics, may provide a generic mechanism for an explosive
instability directly and thus may be responsible for those high-β disruptions with very
fast precursors. The numerical tool used is the CTD code (see [23] and the references
therein) that solves the nonlinear, resistive MHD equations in toroidal geometry.
In
CTD the poloidal and toroidal directions are treated spectrally while a ﬁnite-diﬀerence
mesh is used in the radial direction. Noncircular geometries are treated through a
conformal transformation from the poloidal coordinates (r, θ) to the unit circle in
conformal coordinates (ρc, θc) [24]. A resistive wall[25] and diverted plasmas[26] can
also be treated, but for computational eﬃciency the results discussed here will be in
circular geometry with an ideal wall. However, the coordinate axis will be shifted to the
magnetic axis with a conformal transformation to approximately align the ρc = const.
surfaces with ﬂux surfaces. More general results will be presented elsewhere.

Experimental context for these calculations is,

ironically, not disruptions but
highly stable discharges that last many tens of seconds while exhibiting a long-lived
2/1 mode in the KSTAR tokamak[27], under conditions similar to “advanced/hybrid
scenarios”[28], with high edge safety factor qq5 and a low inductive current fraction.
During investigations into the nature of this mode, it was discovered that in equilibria
with peaked pressure proﬁles, either a benign 2/1 mode that saturates at a small
amplitude, or an explosively growing 2/1 is possible, depending on the details of the
pressure proﬁle. Leaving a more comprehensive treatment to a future publication, this
Letter will focus only on the explosively growing mode.

The equilibrium safety factor and pressure proﬁles used in the calculations,
representative of the advanced/hybrid scenarios in KSTAR, are shown in Fig. 1. The
edge and central safety factors are q95 ∼ 7, q0 ∼ 2, respectively. The pressure
proﬁles tend to be peaked due to on-axis electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH).

Although the plasma-β is moderate for the cases considered here (βN (cid:39) 1.4), the n = 1
mode is ideally unstable for both q-proﬁles shown in Fig. 1. The pressure pedestal
typical of the H(igh)-mode discharges is avoided numerically to prevent complications
introduced by the edge-localized modes (ELM’s).

Figure 1. Equilibirum proﬁles. The q-proﬁles in (a) are calculated by ﬁeld-line tracing
and are shown as a function of (R−R0)/a, where a, R0 are the minor and major radius,
respectively. The slightly non-monotonic proﬁle qI has qmin = 2.04, q0 = 2.11. The
monotonic proﬁle qII has q0 = 1.83. For both proﬁles, q95 = 7.3. The dashed line is
at q = 2. (b) The pressure proﬁle at the mid-plane as a function of ρc, the normalized
radial variable of the conformal coordinate system (ρc, θc).

The n = 1 eigenfunction for the pressure ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 2 (a) for the qI
proﬁle (qII gives similar results). As seen in the ﬁgure, the poloidal structure of the
mode is dominated by an m = 2 component, although smaller m = 3 eﬀects are also
visible. The high and low-ﬁeld side asymmetry of the perturbed pressure is indicative of
a kink-ballooning mode, a low-n version of infernal modes[29]. The ballooning character
of the mode is apparent also in its poloidal energy spectrum in Fig. 2 (b), showing a
coupling that goes much beyond the immediate sidebands at m = 2 ± 1.

The quadrupole geometry of the perturbed pressure (due to the dominance of the
m = 2 component) in Fig. 2 (a) plays a crucial role in the subsequent nonlinear evolution
of the mode. At the toroidal location with this particular phase of the perturbation
(ζ = 0 poloidal plane in this calculation), the ﬂux and pressure surfaces that are nearly

circular initially become elongated in the direction of the major radius (+(cid:99)R) as a result

of this perturbation. Continuing elliptical deformation eventually leads to the formation
of a ballooning ﬁnger on the low-ﬁeld side, as seen in Fig. 3 (a).

Well before the nonlinear evolution of the n = 1 mode reaches the stage in Fig. 3
(a), with a well-deﬁned m = 2 ballooning ﬁnger, its growth becomes explosive. The
ﬁnger proceeds to get narrower and more elongated, reaching in ∼ 20 Alfv´en times the
ﬁnal stage seen in panel (c), where the hot plasma from the core has splashed against
the wall. The end result, of course, is a disruption.

spectrum of the kinetic energy for the n = 1 mode.

Figure 3. Formation and nonlinear evolution of the “explosive ﬁnger” at the ζ = 0
poloidal plane. Figures (a) and (c) are separated by approximately 20 Alfv´en times:
ta = 1483, tc = 1502 in units of poloidal Alfv´en time (See also Fig. 5).

As stated earlier, the explosively growing ballooning ﬁnger and the disruption
that accompanies it are driven entirely by a 2/1 mode; hence, it is not surprising to
ﬁnd an m = 2 signature in the disruptive phase of the mode. As seen in Fig. 4,
projection of the ballooning ﬁnger in Fig. 3(a) along the ﬁeld lines to diﬀerent poloidal
planes globally exhibits an approximate 2/1 symmetry. For a linear high-n ballooning
mode, the pressure perturbation will satisfy p ∝ f (ζ − q(r)θ)g(θ)h(r), where g(θ) is the
ballooning eigenfunction that localizes the mode on the low-ﬁeld, bad-curvature side of
the torus, and h(r) is the radial envelope function. We see that the nonlinear ballooning
structure rotates with q (cid:39) qs = 2/1, except near the tip of the ﬁnger where the eﬀective
q appears to be higher.

Figure 4. Projection of the ballooning ﬁnger in Fig. 3 (c) at ζ = 0 to ζ = π/3, 2π/3,

and π poloidal planes. The toroidal ﬁeld is in the −(cid:98)ζ direction, resulting in the observed

clockwise rotation for increasing toroidal angle ζ.

Explosive nature of the instability is seen in plots of the total kinetic energy (without
the n = 0 contribution) in Fig. 5. Panel (a) shows that the growth rate starts increasing
early in the nonlinear evolution beginning around t (cid:39) 1420 (normalized to the poloidal
Alfv´en time).
In this explosive stage, WK(t) can be ﬁtted with a curve of the form
WK(t) = WK(ti)[(tf − ti)/(tf − t)]ν, where ti = 1417, tf = 1502, and the exponent
ν = 3.37 (panel (b)) Note that the ﬁnite-time singularity model is a very good ﬁt to
the numerical results except at the very end when the plasma starts coming in contact
with the wall. Panel (c) shows the ﬂux surfaces at the beginning of the nonlinear stage.
Except for some high-m resistive modes near the edge, the core plasma is still intact,
indicating the small amplitude of the m = 2 perturbation at this time. This point
is conﬁrmed by the energy plots in (a) and (b), which show that at the beginning of
the nonlinear behavior, the total kinetic energy is still approximately four orders of
magnitude smaller than its ﬁnal value. Note that the evolution of the explosive ﬁnger
seen in Fig. 3 occurs in approximately 20 Alfv´en times at the very end of the plots in
Fig. 5. Thus, this disruption would have only a very brief precursor, much too little to
be of practical experimental use.

The discussion up to this point has been entirely about the equilibrium with the
safety factor qI in Fig. 1, which has q > 2 everywhere. The ideal n = 1 mode displays
a very similar behavior with the equilibrium q-proﬁle qII, which is monotonic and has
q0 = 1.83. Despite the presence of the q = 2 rational surface, the m/n = 2/1 tearing
mode is absent; it appears to be stabilized by curvature eﬀects[30]. Without a signiﬁcant
m = 2 island, the nonlinear evolution of the n = 1 mode again proceeds explosively,
following a very similar trajectory to the qI case. This point is illustrated in the brief
discussion of the thermal quench below.

For both the qI and qII proﬁles, the thermal quench has a large convective
component in the form of explosive m = 2 ballooning ﬁngers. Also on a similar time

Figure 5. (a) The solid curve (blue) shows the growth of the total kinetic energy
in n ≥ 1 modes (nmax = 30 in this calculation). For t ≥ 1420, the growth rate
starts deviating from the purely exponential growth of the dashed line (red). (b) The
dashed curve (red) shows a numerical ﬁt to the end phase of the disruption of the form
WK(t) = WK(ti)[(tf − ti)/(tf − t)]ν where ν = 3.37. (c) Poincar´e plot of the ﬁeld lines

scale, evolution of the ideal n = 1 mode leads to stochastic ﬁeld lines, as seen in Fig. 6
from a disruption that started with the qII proﬁle. Thus, parallel thermal transport also
plays a signiﬁcant role during thermal quench, although the loss of energy through this
channel will not be explosive but occur on a much slower time scale. Ironically, during
the latter stages of the disruption, only the plasma in the explosive ﬁnger seems to be
well-conﬁned, as the ﬂux surfaces remain intact only inside the ﬁnger.

Figure 6. Poincar´e plots of the ﬁeld lines for a disruption using the equilibrium proﬁle
qII . Very similar results are obtained with the qI proﬁle.

As mentioned earlier, this explosive regime was not the initial goal of our studies,
which concentrated on the “long-lived” 2/1 mode observations in KSTAR[27]. Since
it was clear that robustly unstable initial conditions will probably not yield a mode
saturated at a small amplitude, as seen in the experiments, our search concentrated on
equilibrium proﬁles near marginal stability where the n = 1 was only weakly unstable.

Thus, the appearance of an eventual explosive regime when the initial linear growth
rate γτAp ∼ O(10−3) or smaller was a surprise. Since then we have observed the same
behavior with higher initial growth rates; the high resolution calculations presented here
typically started from conditions with γτAp ∼ O(10−2).

the displacement ξ depends on the Mercier indices λL,S = 1/2 ∓(cid:113)

Our numerical results are in qualitative agreement with Cowley’s theory[15, 31] on
the explosive growth of ballooning ﬁngers (compare Fig. 2 of Ref. [31] with Fig. 3 (a)
above). But the exponent of the ﬁnite-time singularity in the energy WK in Fig. 5 (b)
(ν = 3.37) diﬀers by nearly a factor of two from ν = 6.4 found in Cowley’s original
work in slab geometry. However, a subsequent analysis in full toroidal geometry by
Wilson and Cowley[32] predicts that the exponent νd for the ﬁnite-time singularity in
1/4 − DM , with the
exponent given by νd = λS − λL. Assuming DM (cid:39) 0 in our circular geometry yields
νd = 1 and ξ ∼ 1/(tf − t). Then using WK ∼ |∂ξ/∂t|2 leads to the theoretical prediction
WK ∼ 1/(tf − t)4. Thus our result in Fig. 5(b) with ν = 3.37 is much closer to the
predictions of the toroidal theory. The small discrepancy may be due ﬁnite viscous
dissipation and the perfectly conducting boundary conditions used in our simulations,
although these have not been investigated in any detail.

While there have been other conﬁrmations of the explosive nonlinear behavior (see,
for example, Myers[33] and the references therein), Zhu et al. have failed to see it
in their numerical simulations and have attributed this failure to the “limited range
of validity” of the explosive regime[34]. This point might indeed be correct, but we
would like to point out that in our studies of the n = 1 mode, the formation of the
thin, explosive ﬁnger, and approaching the ﬁnite-time singularity in time required us to
retain a large number of higher harmonics of the n = 1 mode; we used up to nmax = 30
in our toroidal Fourier expansions. It is not clear whether Ref. [34], which looked at
an n = 15 ballooning mode, used a correspondingly wide toroidal spectrum in their
numerical studies.

In summary, inherently explosive growth of an ideal n = 1 mode-driven ballooning
ﬁnger, with a predominantly m/n = 2/1 component, has been demonstrated in
nonlinear toroidal simulations. Transition from exponential to explosive growth is
driven nonlinearly by the characteristic quadrupole geometry of the m = 2 pressure
perturbation, which encourages the formation of a ballooning ﬁnger. The ﬁnger becomes
narrower as it explosively pushes through ﬂux surfaces, in qualitative agreement with
published theories. This rapid convective loss of mass and energy from the core to the
exterior, in some tens of Alfv´en times, provides an explanation for fast high-β disruptions
that occur with little or no precursors. Although the thermal quench starts with the
explosive ejection of the hot core, it is also aided, on a slower time scale, by parallel
transport along stochastic ﬁelds that are generated during the explosive phase. The aim
of this Letter was to bring to the attention of the fusion community in a timely manner,
using fast and accurate nonlinear calculations in simple circular geometry, a signiﬁcant
and generic mechanism that may be responsible for high-β disruptions in tokamaks with
very fast precursors. Exploration of more complex geometries with a divertor is left for
