Diﬀerential K-characters and D-branes

Fabio Ferrari Ruﬃno

Abstract. Starting from the deﬁnition of Cheeger-Simons K-character given
in [1] and [6], we show how to describe D-brane world-volumes, the Wess-
Zumino action and topological D-brane charges within the K-theoretical frame-
work in type II superstring theory. We stress in particular how each feature of
the old cohomological classiﬁcation can be reproduced using the K-theoretical
language.

1. Introduction

In the framework of type II superstring theory, there are two fundamental
pictures that describe and classify D-brane charges and the Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds.
The ﬁrst one relies on classical cohomology. In particular, a D-brane world-volume
is a submanifold, which becomes a singular cycle via a suitable triangulation, and
the Poincar´e dual of the underlying homology class is the topological charge. The
Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds are classiﬁed by ordinary diﬀerential cohomology, for which
the Deligne cohomology provides a concrete model [2]. The Wess-Zumino action
turns out to be the holonomy of a diﬀerential cohomology class along the world-
volume. The other fundamental classiﬁcation scheme relies on K-theory [5, 14]. In
particular, the Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds are classiﬁed by a diﬀerential K-theory class
[15, 13], while the topological charge of the D-brane is the corresponding K-theory
class. What we try to clarify in this paper is how to correctly deﬁne the world-
volume in this picture, in order to get a suitable generalization of the holonomy
map to diﬀerential K-theory. In this way we are able to give a correct deﬁnition of
the Wess-Zumino action. Considering the world-volume as a topological K-cycle is
not enough, thus we have to deﬁne a suitable diﬀerential extension of K-cycles, on
which we are able to compute the holonomy. We see that such a deﬁnition leads
to diﬀerential K-characters, as deﬁned in [1] and [6]. In this way we can draw a
complete parallel between the two classiﬁcation schemes. Since we consider ordinary
K-theory, we suppose that the B-ﬁeld is vanishing; otherwise, we must develop an
analogous construction for twisted K-theory and its diﬀerential extension.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the classiﬁcation
scheme via ordinary homology. In section 3 we describe the classiﬁcation scheme

via K-theory. In section 4 we recall the deﬁnition of diﬀerential K-character given
in [6]. In section 5 we apply such a deﬁnition in order to describe the world-volume
and the Wess-Zumino action in the K-theoretical framework, drawing a complete
parallel between the two classiﬁcation schemes.

2. Ordinary diﬀerential cohomology and Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds

If we consider the classical magnetic monopole in 3+1 space-time dimensions,
it is well-known that, because of the Dirac quantization condition, the ﬁeld strength
Fµν can be considered as the curvature of a connection on a gauge bundle on R3\{0}
(or R4 \ ({0} × R)), whose ﬁrst Chern class, belonging to H 2(R3 \ {0}; Z) ≃ Z,
corresponds to the magnetic charge ﬁxed in the origin. If we argue in the same way
for a monopole in a generic space-time dimension n + 1, we need a gauge invariant
integral (n − 1)-form Fµ1...µn−1, whose integral on an (n − 1)-dimensional sphere
around the origin of Rn is the magnetic charge (up to a normalization constant).
Hence, because of the Dirac quantization condition, such a ﬁeld strength can be
thought of as the curvature of a connection on an abelian (n − 3)-gerbe, whose ﬁrst
Chern class, belonging to H n−1(Rn \ {0}, Z) ≃ Z, corresponds to the charge ﬁxed
in the origin. That’s why p-gerbes naturally arise when dealing with monopoles in
a space-time of generic dimension. Since a D-brane, at a semiclassical level, can
be thought of as a generalized magnetic monopole whose charge is measured by
the Ramond-Ramond ﬁeld strength, it follows that the Ramond-Ramond potentials
Cµ1...µp+1 and ﬁeld strength Gµ1...µp+2 can be thought of respectively as a connection
and its curvature on an abelian p-gerbe. A concrete way to describe abelian p-gerbes
with connection is provided by the Deligne cohomology [2].

Given a compact smooth manifold X, we consider the complex of sheaves:

(2.1)

Sp
X = U (1)

˜d−→ Ω1

R

d−→ · · ·

d−→ Ωp
R,

where U (1) is the sheaf of smooth U (1)-valued functions, Ωk
R is the sheaf of real
k-forms, d is the exterior diﬀerential and ˜d = 1
2πi d ◦ log. The Deligne cohomology
group of degree p on X is the ˇCech hypercohomology group of the complex (2.1),
i.e., ˇH p(X, Sp
It can be concretely described via a good cover U = {Uα}α∈I
of X: by deﬁnition, we consider the double complex whose columns are the ˇCech
complexes of the sheaves involved in (2.1), and we consider the cohomology of the
associated total complex. This means that a p-cocycle is deﬁned by a sequence
(gα0···αp+1, (C1)α0 ···αp , . . . , (Cp)α0α1, (Cp+1)α0 ), satisfying the conditions:

X ).

(2.2)

(Cp+1)β − (Cp+1)α = (−1)p+1d(Cp)αβ
(Cp)αβ + (Cp)βγ + (Cp)γα = (−1)p d(Cp−1)αβγ
. . .
ˇδp(C1)α0...αp = 1
ˇδp+1gα0...αp+1 = 1.

2πi d log gα0...αp+1

The local forms dCp+1 glue to a gauge-invariant one Gp+2, which is the curvature
of the p-gerbe. We stress that, with respect to this model, the datum of the super-
string background must include a complete equivalence class, not only the top-forms
Cp+1. As for line bundles, the correspondence [Gp+2]dR ≃ c1(G) ⊗Z R holds, in par-
ticular the Dirac quantization condition applies for any p. From a physical point of
view, Deligne cohomology describes gauge transformations. Conditions (2.2) spec-
ify how the local potentials glue on the intersections, and this concerns a single

DIFFERENTIAL K-CHARACTERS AND D-BRANES

representative of the equivalence class. There are also possible gauge transforma-
tions consisting in the addition of a coboundary. The real datum is the cohomology
class, since it is determined by the two real physical observables: the ﬁeld strength
(corresponding to the ﬁeld F in electromagnetism) and the holonomy of the con-
nection or Wess-Zumino action (corresponding in electromagnetism to the phase
diﬀerence measured in the context of the Aranhov-Bohm eﬀect). The holonomy
is the exponential of the Wilson loop; it can be deﬁned for any p generalizing the
deﬁnition of the Wilson loop for line bundles. A line bundle with connection is de-
scribed by a Deligne cohomology class of degree 1, i.e., by [(gαβ, Aα)] ∈ ˇH 1(X, S1
X ).
The Wilson loop is usually described as the minimal coupling between the poten-
tials A and the loop γ, that’s why it is usually written as Rγ A. Actually the correct

deﬁnition must also take into account the transition functions. In particular, we
divide the loop γ in intervals γ1, . . . , γm, such that γi is contained in a chart Uαi.
Then we integrate the local potential Aαi on γi and we compute the logarithm of
the transition function gαiαi+1 on the intersection point between γi and γi+1. The
sum is the Wilson loop, its exponential the holonomy along γ. Such a deﬁnition
can be generalized to any p, even if the explicit formula is much more complicated
to write down concretely [10]. The basic idea is the following: given a Deligne
cohomology class [(gα0 ···αp+1, (C1)α0 ···αp , . . . , (Cp)α0α1 , (Cp+1)α0 )] of degree p + 1
and a smooth (p + 1)-submanifold Γ, we choose a suitable triangulation of Γ, such
that each simplex is contained in a chart. Then we integrate the potentials Cp+1
on the (p + 1)-simplicies, the potentials Cp on the p-simplicies, and so on until the
transition functions on the vertices. A suitable formula joining these data gives the
Wilson loop, which is the Wess-Zumino action in string theory. The result depends
on the cycle, not only on the homology class, except when the curvature vanishes.
This is coherent with the fact that the world-volume is a cycle, not only a homology
class. Only in the ﬂat case is the holonomy a morphism from Hp+1(X; Z) to U (1),
hence ﬂat abelian p-gerbes are classiﬁed by the group H p+1(X; R/Z). This is due
to a Stokes-type formula for the holonomy on a trivial cycle: the holonomy over a
boundary ∂A is the exponential of the integral of the curvature on A.

Calling ˆH p(X) the Deligne cohomology group of degree p − 1, i.e. ˆH p(X) :=

ˇH p−1(X, Sp−1

X ), we get the following commutative diagram [11]:

Here c1 is the ﬁrst Chern class, curv is the curvature, dR is the de-Rham cohomol-
ogy class and Ω•
int(X) is the group of closed real forms that represent an integral
cohomology class. Diagram (2.3) shows that ˆH •(X) is a diﬀerential reﬁnement of
H •(X; Z), adding the piece of information due to the connection. Moreover, one
can prove that, given a class α ∈ ˆH p+2(X), if c1(α) = 0, then α can be represented
by a cocycle of the form (1, 0, . . . , 0, Cp+1), where Cp+1 is a globally deﬁned (p + 1)-
form. In this case the Wilson loop on a (p + 1)-submanifold Γ is simply given by

RΓ Cp+1. Such a global potential is unique up to large gauge transformation, i.e.,

up to the addition of a closed integral form.

With respect to this model, the local Ramond-Ramond potentials Cp+1 are (a
part of) a connection on an abelian p-gerbe, whose curvature is the ﬁeld strength
Gp+2. In this case a Dp-brane world-volume is thought of as a (p + 1)-dimensional
submanifold W of the space-time X. The world-volume W , via a suitable triangu-
lation, deﬁnes a singular (p + 1)-cycle, that we also call W . When the numerical
charge is q ∈ Z, we think of a stack of q D-branes (anti-branes if q < 0), whose
underlying cycle is qW . The topological charge of the D-brane is the Poincar´e dual
of the underlying homology class [qW ] ∈ Hp+1(X; Z). The Wess-Zumino action,

usually written as RW Cp+1, is the holonomy of the connection on W . Moreover,

calling n := dim W , the violated Bianchi identity is:

dGn−p−2 = q · δ(W )

dGp+2 = 0.

This implies that Gn−p−2 is a closed form in the complement of W and, if L is
a linking manifold of W , with linking number l, we get 1
That’s why ﬁeld strengths are quantized and can be thought of as the curvature of
a connection.

l RL Gn−p−2 = q ∈ Z.

3. Diﬀerential K-theory and Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds

It is well known that K-theory is a better tool than ordinary cohomology in
order to classify D-brane charges [5, 7]. We ﬁrst introduce some technical tools
about K-theory and K-homology, then we recall the advantages of the K-theoretical
classiﬁcation.

3.1. K-homology. We consider a variant of the usual deﬁnition of topological
K-homology, that will be more suitable for our purposes later: we replace the “vec-
tor bundle modiﬁcation” with the Gysin map, which is the natural push-forward
in cohomology. We brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition. Given an embedding ι : Y → X of
compact manifolds of codimension r, we consider the following data:

• a K-orientation of the normal bundle NY X,

K r

cpt(NY X);

i.e., a Thom class u ∈

• a tubular neighbourhood U of Y and a diﬀeomorphism ϕU : NY X → U ;
• the open embedding i : U ֒→ X, inducing a push-forward in compactly-
supported cohomology. Such a push-forward is deﬁned as the pull-back
via the map i′ : X → U +, which is the identity on U and sends X \ U to
the point at inﬁnity.

There is a natural K(X)-module structure on Kcpt(NY X), hence we deﬁne ι! :
K •(X) → K •+r(Y ) as follows: ι!(α) := i∗(ϕU )∗(α · u). The Gysin map turns
out to be independent of the choices involved in the construction, except for the
orientation of the normal bundle.
If X and Y are K-oriented manifolds and ι
respects the orientations, since T X|Y ≃ T Y ⊕ NY X, we get an induced orientation
on NY X. This implies that the Gysin map is well-deﬁned for an embedding of
K-oriented manifolds. If f : Y → X is a generic smooth map between compact
manifolds, we consider an embedding ι : Y ֒→ X × RN such that πX ◦ ι = f . Then
we deﬁne f!(α) := RRN ι!(α). Again, if f is a map of K-oriented manifolds, we get
an induced orientation on NY (X × RN ), hence the Gysin map is well-deﬁned.

We now come back to K-homology. On a smooth compact manifold X, we
deﬁne the group of n-precycles as the free abelian group generated by the quadruples
(M, u, α, f ) such that:

DIFFERENTIAL K-CHARACTERS AND D-BRANES

5

• M is a smooth compact manifold (without boundary) with K-orientation
u (i.e., with Thom class u on the tangent bundle), whose connected com-
ponents {Mi} have dimension n + qi, being qi arbitrary;

• α ∈ K •(M ), such that α|Mi ∈ K qi (M );
• f : M → X is a smooth map.

We deﬁne the group of n-cycles, denoted by zn(X), as the quotient of the group of
n-precycles by the free subgroup generated by elements of the form:

• (M, u, α + β, f ) − (M, u, α, f ) − (M, u, β, f );
• (M, u, α, f ) − (M1, u|M1, α|M1 , f |M1) − (M2, u|M2 , α|M2 , f |M2), for M =

M1 ⊔ M2;

• (M, u, ϕ!α, f ) − (N, v, α, f ◦ ϕ) for ϕ : (N, v) → (M, u) a smooth map.

We deﬁne the group of n-boundaries, denoted by bn(X), as the subgroup of zn(X)
generated by the cycles which are representable by a pre-cycle (M, u, α, f ) with
the following property: there exists a quadruple (W, U, A, F ) such that W is a
manifold and M = ∂W , U is a K-orientation of W and U |M = u, A ∈ K •(W )
and A|M = α, F : W → X is a smooth map satisfying F |M = f . We deﬁne
Kn(X) := zn(X)/bn(X). It seems to be more natural to use the Gysin map in the
deﬁnition, since it is the natural push-forward in cohomology, the vector bundle
modiﬁcation being just a particular case. Moreover, we do not have to quotient out
explicitly up to diﬀeomorphism the ﬁrst component of the quadruple (M, u, α, f ),
since the pull-back via a diﬀeomorphism is again a particular case of the Gysin map.

Let us consider a Dp-brane world-volume W in the space-time X. As before
we call n = dim X. The U (q)-gauge theory on W lives on a complex vector bundle
E → W of rank q, being q the number of D-branes in the stack. Hence there is a
well-deﬁned K-theory class [E] ∈ K 0(W ). Moreover, because of the Freed-Witten
anomaly [9], W is a spinc-manifold, which is the condition in order to admit a K-
theoretical orientation u (that we ﬁx as a part of the world-volume datum). Finally,
we consider the embedding in the space-time ι : W ֒→ X. In this way we get a
K-homology class [(W, u, E, ι)] ∈ Kp+1(X). Since also X is K-orientable (because
it is a spin manifold, hence, in particular, spinc), we can apply Poincar´e duality
and describe the topological charge as a K-theory class of X, which is precisely
ι![E] ∈ K n−p−1(X).

We can now recall some advantages of the K-theoretical classiﬁcation. First
of all, it rules out Freed-Witten anomalous world-volumes, which are precisely the
non-K-orientable ones. On the contrary, the classiﬁcation via singular cohomology
is unable to detect this anomaly. Moreover, in the K-theoretical charge we also
take into account the presence of the Chan-Patton bundle and of the embedding
in the space-time; this fact will lead to the presence of the gauge and gravitational
couplings in the Wess-Zumino action, therefore we get more complete information.
Finally, since the D-brane charge is a K-theory class of the space-time, it can be
thought of as the formal diﬀerence between two space-ﬁlling D-brane stacks of
equal rank: this is compatible with the Sen conjecture, stating that any D-brane
conﬁguration in the space-time can be obtained from a pair made by a D9-brane
and a D9-antibrane, via the process of annihilation due to tachyon condensation.

3.2. Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds. Since the D-brane charge is described by K-
theory, the Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds, that measure such a charge, must be quantized

with respect to K-theory, not with respect to ordinary cohomology. In order to
make this concept more precise, we consider a diagram analogous to (2.3), but with
respect to K-theory instead of ordinary cohomology [4]. This means that we look
for a graded group ˆK •(X) ﬁtting into the following diagram:

Here ch is the Chern character, k•
Kint(X; k•

is the graded group of closed (poly)forms with integral K-periods, in the sense
that we now specify. Given a form ω ∈ Ωn
R) and a K-homology class
[(M, u, α, f )] ∈ Kn(X), we can consider the following pairing:

R is the K-theory ring of the point and Ω•

cl(X; k•

(3.2)

hω, [(M, u, α, f )]i := ZM

f ∗ω ∧ ch(α) ∧ ˆAK (M ).

We say that ω is K-integral or has integral K-periods if such a pairing gives an
integral value for any K-homology class. One can prove that a form is K-integral
if and only if its cohomology class belongs to the image of the Chern character.

There are various models for ˆK •(X); here we consider the Freed-Lott model
of ˆK 0(X) [8], that can be extended to any degree (actually only the parity of the
degree is meaningful, since Bott periodicity holds even for the diﬀerential exten-
sion). Given two connections ∇ and ∇′ on the same vector bundle E, there is
a natural equivalence class CS(∇, ∇′) of odd-dimensional forms up to exact ones,
called Chern-Simons class, such that ch(∇) − ch(∇′) = dCS(∇, ∇′). We deﬁne a
diﬀerential vector bundle on X as a quadruple (E, h, ∇, ω) where:

• E is a complex vector bundle on X;
• h is an Hermitian metric on E;
• ∇ is a connection on E compatible with h;
• ω ∈ Ωodd(X)/Im(d) is a class of real odd-dimensional diﬀerential forms

up to exact ones.

The direct sum between diﬀerential vector bundles is deﬁned as (E, h, ∇, ω) ⊕
(E ′, h′, ∇′, ω′) := (E ⊕ E ′, h ⊕ h′, ∇ ⊕ ∇′, ω + ω′). An isomorphism of diﬀeren-
tial vector bundles Φ : (E, h, ∇, ω) → (E ′, h′, ∇′, ω′) is an isomorphism of complex
Hermitian vector bundles Φ : (E, h) → (E ′, h′) such that:

(3.3)

ω − ω′ ∈ CS(∇, Φ∗∇′).

The isomorphism classes of diﬀerential vector bundles form an abelian semigroup,
hence we can consider its Grothendieck group ˆK 0(X). By deﬁnition an element
of ˆK 0(X) is a diﬀerence [(E, h, ∇, ω)] − [(E ′, h′, ∇′, ω′)], where [(E, h, ∇, ω)] is the
class up to the stable equivalence relation.

The group that we have deﬁned ﬁts into the diagram (3.1) considering the two

maps:

c1[(E, h, ∇, ω)] := [E]

curv[(E, h, ∇, ω)] := ch(∇) − dω,

where ch(∇) = Tr exp( i
integral since:

2π Ω), Ω being the curvature of ∇. The curvature is K-

hch(∇) − dω, [(M, u, α, f )]i = ZM

ch(f ∗E · α) ∧ ˆAK(M ) ∈ Z

because of the index theorem. As we have already pointed out, there is an analogous
model for ˆK 1(X).

We have seen that an abelian p-gerbe with vanishing ﬁrst Chern class can always
be represented by a cocycle of the form (1, 0, . . . , 0, Cp+1), where Cp+1 is globally
deﬁned and unique up to the addition of an integral form. An analogous consider-
ation holds for diﬀerential K-theory: a class α ∈ ˆK p(X) with vanishing ﬁrst Chern
class can be represented in the form [(0, 0, 0, Cp−1)], where Cp−1 ∈ Ωp−1(X; k•
R) is
globally deﬁned and unique up to the addition of a K-integral form.

We are now able to describe the Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds in the K-theoretical
framework. Because of the Bott periodicity, the two meaningful groups are ˆK 0(X)
and ˆK 1(X), corresponding respectively to type IIB and type IIA theory. The
Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds with even-degree ﬁeld strength are jointly classiﬁed by a
class α ∈ ˆK 0(X), while the ones with odd-degree ﬁeld strength are classiﬁed by
β ∈ ˆK 1(X). We discuss the features of α, the discussion about β being analogous.
The curvature of α is a form Gev ∈ Ω0
cl (X). The component
of degree 2p is the ﬁeld-strength G2p. If we consider a local chart U of X, then
α|U is topologically trivial, hence it can be represented in the form (0, 0, 0, Codd),
with Codd ∈ Ω−1(U ; k•
form (on a contractible chart U , any K-integral form, being closed, is exact). The
component of degree 2p − 1 is the local potential C2p−1. This means that the
potentials are a local expression of a global diﬀerential K-theory class, which is the
complete datum encoded in the space-time.

R) ≃ Lp∈Z Ω2p−1(U ), unique up to the addition of an exact

R) ≃ Lp∈Z Ω2p

Now the main point is the following. How do we have to think of a D-brane
world-volume in the K-theoretical framework, in order to correctly deﬁne the Wess-
Zumino action? Comparing with the framework of ordinary cohomology, it seems
natural to think of it as a K-homology cycle, representing a class whose Poincar´e
dual is the topological charge. This is possible, but we will see that it is not enough
in order to deﬁne the Wess-Zumino action.

3.3. Comparing the two frameworks. Let us start from the mathematics.
In table 1 we compare the features of ordinary diﬀerential cohomology with the
ones of diﬀerential K-theory. We can see that there is a complete analogy between
the two pictures, except for the holonomy, since we have to clarify on which cycles
it must be computed in the case of K-theory (in the table, Z sm
• denotes the smooth
singular cycles).

Physically, Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds in type II superstring theory are classiﬁed
by an abelian p-gerbe or by a diﬀerential K-theory class (line 1 of table 1). The ﬁeld
strength is the curvature in each case, hence it obeys the corresponding quantization
condition (line 3 of table 1). Any class is locally topologically trivial, hence we get
the local Ramond-Ramond potentials up to gauge transformations (line 4 of table
1). The world-volume is a singular cycle in the ﬁrst picture, and the Poincar´e dual
of the underlying homology class is the topological charge; the Wess-Zumino action

is the holonomy of the Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds on the world-volume (line 6 of table
1). What is the Wess-Zumino action in the K-theoretical framework?

We have seen that the topological D-brane charge is measured by the K-theory
class of the space-time Poincar´e dual to [(W, u, E, ι)] ∈ Kp+1(X), where W is the
world-volume as a sub-manifold, u is a ﬁxed Thom class of the tangent bundle
of W , E is the Chan-Patton bundle and ι is the embedding of W in the space-
time. This class is ι![E]. Hence, we could consider as the world-volume the K-
cycle (W, u, E, ι), but we do not know how to deﬁne the holonomy of the class
α ∈ ˆK p+2(X), representing the Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds. Usually the pairing is
written supposing that α is topologically trivial, hence described by a global form
C. It has the following form [12]:

(3.4)

hα, (W, u, E, ι)i = ZW

C ∧ ch(E) ∧ ˆAK(W ) ∧ ˆAK(X)− 1
2 .

d

We denote by ˆAK the ˆA-genus of K-theory, i.e., ˆA ∧ e
2 , where d ∈ H 2(W ; Z)
is a suitable class whose Z2-reduction is w2(W ) [12]. Equation (3.4) has some
problems. The most evident one is what we have already said: it holds only when
α is topologically trivial. Actually, even in this case, we can make some more
remarks. The form C in general is not-closed, hence the integral on W depends
on the speciﬁc representatives of ch(E) and ˆAK(W ) (we neglect for the moment
ˆAK(X), since it does not depend on the D-brane). How do we choose them? It is not
diﬃcult to reply for ch(E): since ch(E) = [Tr exp( i
2π Ω)], Ω being the curvature of a

DIFFERENTIAL K-CHARACTERS AND D-BRANES

connection on E, we have to ﬁx a connection on E in order to ﬁx a representative of
ch(E). We choose the connection deﬁning the U (q)-gauge theory on the D-brane, q
being the rank of E. This fact shows that, even when α is topologically trivial, we
cannot consider as the world-volume the topological K-cycle (W, u, E, ι): at least
we need to include the connection on E as a part of the datum. Moreover, what
about the ˆA-genus? It does not seem so trivial to ﬁnd a natural representative,
hence we need some information more. In the next sections we try to ﬁll this gap.
There is an element missing in the previous list: in the framework of ordinary
cohomology, the numerical charge of a D-brane is measured by the integral of the
dual ﬁeld-strength on a linking manifold. It is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd the analogous
property in the K-theoretical framework, actually we could do this even considering
the world-volume just as a topological K-cycle, but we postpone the discussion to
the last section.

4. Diﬀerential K-characters

We try to reply to the previous questions looking for a suitable deﬁnition of
diﬀerential K-cycle and diﬀerential K-character. The idea we presented in [6] is
the following. Let us consider a K-cycle (M, u, α, f ) of degree p on X and a diﬀer-
ential K-theory class ˆβ ∈ ˆK p+1(X) (of course only the parity of p is meaningful).
We have that α ∈ K q(X), where q satisﬁes dim M = p + q. If we reﬁne α to a
diﬀerential class ˆα, then we can consider the product ˆα · f ∗ ˆβ ∈ ˆK p+q+1(M ). There
is a unique map from M to the point, that we call pM . If we are able to deﬁne
the diﬀerential reﬁnement of the Gysin map, via a suitable diﬀerential reﬁnement
of the orientation u (that we call ˆu), we can calculate (pM )!(ˆα · f ∗ ˆβ) ∈ ˆK 1(pt). We
now prove that ˆK 1(pt) ≃ R/Z canonically, hence we can deﬁne the holonomy of
ˆβ on (M, ˆu, ˆα, f ) as exp((pM )!(ˆα · f ∗ ˆβ)). This shows that, in order to deﬁne the
holonomy, we must consider a suitable diﬀerential reﬁnement of the topological K-
cycles, that will lead us to deﬁne diﬀerential K-characters. We have to show that
ˆK 1(pt) ≃ R/Z canonically. Since K 1(pt) = 0, a class γ ∈ ˆK 1(pt) is topologically
trivial, hence it can be represented by a form ω ∈ Ω0(pt; k•
R). On a
point there are non-zero forms only in degree 0, and they are real numbers. The
K-integral ones are precisely the integer numbers, since, in the pairing (3.2), f ∗ω

Kint(pt; k•

R)/Ω0

is constant and RM ch(α) ∧ ˆAK(M ) is integral because of the index theorem. This

shows that Ω0(pt; k•

R) ≃ R/Z.

Kint(pt; k•

Let us present the precise deﬁnition of diﬀerential K-character. We have shown
above that we must consider suitable diﬀerential reﬁnements of the components
of a topological K-cycle. The main point is that, when dealing with diﬀerential
classes, the curvature is meaningful as a single form, not only as a cohomology
class, therefore it is not homotopy invariant. Thus, we need suitable deﬁnitions in
order to recover classical topological tools as the 2x3 rule about the orientation of
the bundles E, F , E ⊕ F . In particular, we have to correctly deﬁne the concept
of orientation of a smooth map with respect to diﬀerential K-theory [11], which
encodes the data that we need to ﬁx. First of all, following [3], we deﬁne a ˆK-
orientation of a smooth vector bundle as a diﬀerential extension1 of a Thom class
of the bundle. Then we deﬁne a representative of a ˆK-orientation of a smooth map

1A diﬀerential extension of a class α ∈ K n(X) is a class ˆα ∈ ˆK n(X) such that c1(ˆα) = α.

10

f : Y → X between compact manifolds (neat if X and Y have boundary) as the
datum of:

• a (neat) embedding ι : Y ֒→ X × RN for any N ∈ N, such that πX ◦ ι = f ;
• a ˆK-orientation ˆu of the normal bundle NY (X × RN );
• a (neat) tubular neighbourhood U of Y in X × RN with a diﬀeomorphism

ϕ : NY (X × RN ) → U .

Using a deﬁnition similar to the topological one, it turns out that the Gysin map
f! : ˆK •(Y ) → ˆK •+r(X) is well deﬁned if f is endowed with a representative of a
ˆK-orientation. We can suitably deﬁne homotopy and equivalence by stabilization
in the set of representatives of ˆK-orientations, and we call ˆK-orientation of f an
equivalence class. Moreover, a smooth manifold M is ˆK-oriented if the unique map
from M to a point is ˆK-oriented.

With this deﬁnition, as in the topological case, if f is a proper submersion be-
tween ˆK-oriented manifolds, then it automatically inherits an orientation. Actually
the technical details are more complicated. We just sketch the problems. First of
all, one fundamental property of the Gysin map is that it is compatible with the
composition, i.e., (g ◦f )! = g! ◦f!. Moreover, it satisﬁes f!(α·f ∗β) = f!α·β. In order
to maintain these properties in the diﬀerential case, we need the hypothesis that f
is a submersion, because, in this case, considering the embedding ι : Y ֒→ X × RN ,
we can choose the tubular neighbourhood of Y in such a way that the image of the
ﬁbre of the normal bundle on y ∈ Y is contained in {ι(y)} × RN . In this way, when
we consider α · f ∗β and we apply f!, the multiplication by β acts as a multiplication
by a constant class on each ﬁbre of the tubular neighbourhood, therefore it factor-
izes in the integral with respect to RN . A similar argument holds in order to prove
that (g ◦ f )! = g! ◦ f!. Moreover, thanks to the equivalence relation we introduced
among the representatives of orientations, the embedding ι is meaningful only up
to homotopy and stabilization, and the choice of the tubular neighborhood is im-
material. This is important by a physical point of view, since a ﬁxed embedding
and a ﬁxed tubular neighbourhood would have no physical meaning.

Now we can come back to the deﬁnition of diﬀerential K-character. On a
smooth compact manifold X, we deﬁne the group of diﬀerential n-precycles as the
free abelian group generated by the quadruples (M, ˆu, ˆα, f ) such that:

• M is a smooth compact manifold (without boundary) with ˆK •-orientation
ˆu,2 whose connected components {Mi} have dimension n + qi, with qi
arbitrary;

• ˆα ∈ ˆK •(M ), such that ˆα|Mi ∈ ˆK qi (M );
• f : M → X is a smooth map.

The group of diﬀerential n-cycles, denoted by ˆzn(X), is the quotient of the group
of n-precycles by the free subgroup generated by elements of the form:

• (M, ˆu, ˆα + ˆβ, f ) − (M, ˆu, ˆα, f ) − (M, ˆu, ˆβ, f );
• (M, ˆu, ˆα, f ) − (M1, ˆu|M1 , ˆα|M1 , f |M1) − (M2, ˆu|M2 , ˆα|M2 , f |M2), for M =

M1 ⊔ M2;

• (M, ˆu, ϕ! ˆα, f ) − (N, ˆv, ˆα, f ◦ ϕ) for ϕ : N → M a submersion, oriented via

the 2x3 principle.

2Here we denote by ˆu the whole diﬀerential orientation, not only the diﬀerential reﬁnement

of the Thom class u.

DIFFERENTIAL K-CHARACTERS AND D-BRANES

11

The group of diﬀerential n-boundaries, denoted by ˆbn(X), is the subgroup of ˆzn(X)
generated by the cycles which are representable by a pre-cycle (M, ˆu, ˆα, f ) with
the following property. There exists a quadruple (W, ˆU , ˆA, F ) such that W is a
manifold and M = ∂W , ˆU is an ˆK •-orientation of W and ˆU |M = ˆu, ˆA ∈ ˆK •(W )
and ˆA|M = ˆα, F : W → X is a smooth map satisfying F |M = f . We deﬁne
Kn(X) := ˆzn(X)/ˆbn(X).

The homology groups, deﬁned in this way, are isomorphic to the ones deﬁned
via topological cycles, as shown above. We have deﬁned the diﬀerential cycles in
such a way that it is possible to integrate a diﬀerential cohomology class on such
a cycle. When the class is ﬂat and only the homology class is meaningful, we need
no diﬀerential information, since the group of ﬂat classes is Hom(Kp−1(X), R/Z);
that’s why we do not need a non-trivial diﬀerential extension of the homology
classes. We will see in the following the physical meaning of this fact.

Given a class ˆβ ∈ ˆK p+1(X) and a diﬀerential p-cycle (M, ˆu, ˆα, f ), with dim M =
p+q and ˆα ∈ ˆK q(M ), we can compute the holonomy as we sketched at the beginning
of this paragraph: we consider the class ˆα · f ∗ ˆβ ∈ ˆK p+q+1(M ) and, since M is ˆK-
oriented, i.e., the map pM : M → pt is ˆK-oriented, we can calculate (pM )!(ˆα·f ∗ ˆβ) ∈
ˆK 1(pt) ≃ R/Z. The exponential of the result is the holonomy. One can show that
the holonomy completely characterizes the diﬀerential K-theory class, as in the
case of ordinary cohomology. When the cycle is a boundary, a Stokes-type formula
holds even in the K-theoretical framework: if (M, ˆu, ˆα, f ) = ∂(W, ˆU , ˆA, F ), then

(4.1)

Hol(M,ˆu, ˆα,f )( ˆβ) = expZW

F ∗curv( ˆβ) ∧ curv( ˆA) ∧ ˆA ˆK(W ).

Here ˆA ˆK(W ) is a representative of ˆAK(W ), which is deﬁned as RNW RN /W curv(ˆu),

where the embedding of W in RN is provided by the diﬀerential orientation of W .
Formula (4.1) implies that, if α is ﬂat, its holonomy over a trivial cycle is zero.
Hence, in this case, the holonomy only depends on the K-homology class.

Thanks to diﬀerential K-characters we can complete table 1: in the K-theoretical

framework, the holonomy is a group morphism ˆz•−1(X) → U (1).

5. Diﬀerential K-characters, D-branes and Ramond-Ramond ﬁelds

We can now complete the K-theoretical description of D-branes in type II
superstring theory. We describe a D-brane world-volume as a diﬀerential K-cycle.
In particular, we consider the topological K-cycle (W, u, E, ι), where (we recall) u
is a Thom class of W , E is the Chan-Patton bundle and ι is the embedding of W
in the space-time. On E there is the U (q)-gauge theory of the D-brane, hence E is
endowed with an Hermitian metric h and a compatible connection ∇. Therefore,
we can consider the diﬀerential K-theory class [(E, h, ∇, 0)], using the Freed-Lott
model. We call ˆE such a class. Moreover, we reﬁne u to a diﬀerential orientation ˆu
of W , that must be ﬁxed as a part of the datum. We get a diﬀerential K-theory class
(W, ˆu, ˆE, ι), that is the world-volume in the K-theoretical framework. Actually, we
consider one cycle made by all the even-dimensional world-volumes or one made by
all the odd-dimensional ones, depending whether we are considering the type IIA or
type IIB theory. In this way, we can correctly deﬁne the Wess-Zumino action: it is
the holonomy of the diﬀerential K-theory class, representing the Ramond-Ramond

12

ﬁelds, on the world-volume. How do we compute the topological charge? Here we
see the physical importance of the fact that the K-homology groups, deﬁned via
diﬀerential cycles and boundaries, are isomorphic to the ones deﬁned via topological
cycles and boundaries: the Poincar´e dual of the underlying K-homology class of
the world-volume is the topological charge that we have already deﬁned.

We show that, when the class is topologically trivial, the holonomy coincides
with (3.4). Actually, we obtain this result normalizing the class with ˆA ˆK (X)− 1
2 . In
fact, let us call a(Codd) the topologically trivial class represented by the global form
Codd, i.e., in the Freed-Lott model, a(Codd) = [(0, 0, 0, Codd)] (again, the discussion
about Cev is analogous). Let us compute the holonomy of a(Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1
2 )
along the diﬀerential K-cycle (W, ˆu, ˆE, ι). We have that:

(5.1)

(pW )!(ι∗a(Codd∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2 ) · ˆE) = (pW )!(a(ι∗Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2

∧ curv( ˆE)) = (pW )!(a(ι∗Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK (X)− 1

2 ∧ ch∇E)).

For the ﬁrst equality we have used the relation a(Codd) · ˆE = a(Codd ∧ curv( ˆE)),
which is a fundamental property of diﬀerential cohomology. Now we apply the
deﬁnition of the Gysin map. We consider the data provided by any representative
of the diﬀerential orientation ˆu of W : an embedding j : W ֒→ RN , a tubular
neighbourhood U of W in RN , the diﬀeomorphism ϕU : NW RN → U and the open
embedding i : U ֒→ RN . From (5.1) we get:

ZRN

i∗(ϕU )∗(a(ι∗Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2 ∧ ch∇E) · ˆu)

i∗(ϕU )∗(a(ι∗Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2 ∧ ch∇E ∧ curv(ˆu)))

ι∗Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2 ∧ ch∇E ∧ curv(ˆu)(cid:19)

= ZRN
= a(cid:18)ZNW RN
= a(cid:18)ZW ZNW RN /W
= a(cid:18)ZW
= a(cid:18)ZW

ι∗Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2 ∧ ch∇E ∧ curv(ˆu)(cid:19)
curv(ˆu)(cid:19)

ι∗Codd ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2 ∧ ch∇E ∧ZNW RN /W
2(cid:19).
ι∗Codd ∧ ch∇E ∧ ˆA ˆK (W ) ∧ ˆA ˆK (X)− 1

Thus the holonomy is the exponential of RW ι∗Codd ∧ ch∇E ∧ ˆA ˆK(W ) ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1
2 ,
as stated in equation (3.4). We see that, in this case, we have canonical repre-
sentatives of chE and ˆAK(X), provided by the curvatures of ˆE and ˆu, that are
two components of the world-volume thought of as a diﬀerential K-cycle. Since
it is necessary to normalize with ˆA ˆK(X)− 1
2 the K-theory class whose holonomy
we are calculating, we have to ﬁx a representative of such a class as a part of the
background. This would follow automatically reﬁning the space-time manifold to a
diﬀerential K-cycle too, but it is not necessary, we just choose a representative of
the ˆA-genus as a normalization constant.

Using classical cohomology, the integral of the ﬁeld-strength along a linking
manifold is the numerical charge of the D-brane. A linking manifold L of W is
the boundary of a manifold S that intersects W transversely in a ﬁnite number of

DIFFERENTIAL K-CHARACTERS AND D-BRANES

13

points of the interior. The number of such points is the linking number. Within
the K-theoretical framework, we can generalize this concept. First of all, when we
consider a D-brane world-volume W with Chan-Patton bundle E, there is not only
that charge of W itself, but there are sub-brane charges which are encoded in E. In
particular, since in the Wess-Zumino action the Chern character ch E appears, we
can interpret the Poincar´e duals of the Chern characters as sub-branes of W with
a charge. Because of this, a linking manifold of W is not enough. Since the ﬁeld-
strength is K-quantized, it is natural to consider a linking K-cycle (L, u, F, ι). Here
L is a “generalized” linking manifold, i.e., L is the boundary of a manifold S such
that S and W intersect transversely in a submanifold (without boundary) contained
in the interior of S. If S ∩ W is 0-dimensional, we get a linking manifold in the
usual sense. We consider the even-dimensional ﬁeld-strengths Gev, the discussion
about Godd being analogous. The violated Bianchi identity is [12]:

(5.2)

dGev = δ(W ) ∧ ch∇E ∧ ˆA ˆK (W ) ∧ ˆA ˆK (X)− 1
2 ,

where W is the union of all the world-volumes with dimension of the suitable parity.
Here, again, we see the importance of having representatives of the Chern character
and the ˆA-genus, because dGev is a form (actually, a current) and not a cohomology
class. Equation (5.2) implies that Gev ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1
2 is K-quantized and the pairing
with a linking K-cycle gives the corresponding charge. In fact:

hGev ∧ ˆAK(X)− 1

Gev ∧ ˆAK(X)− 1

2 ∧ ch(F ) ∧ ˆAK(L)

2 ,(L, u, F, ι)i = ZL
= ZS
= ZS
= ZS∩W

dGev ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1

2 ∧ ch(F ) ∧ ˆA ˆK(S)

ˆA ˆK(W ) ∧ ˆA ˆK(S)

δ(W ) ∧ ch(E ⊗ F ) ∧

ˆA ˆK (X)
ch(E ⊗ F ) ∧ ˆAK(S ∩ W ) ∈ Z.

If L is a linking manifold and F is the trivial line bundle, then we get RS∩W ch0E =
ql, as in the previous case (l is the linking number and q = ch0E). Let us consider
ch1E. If we represent P DW (ch1E) as a cycle qW ′ of codimension 2, we suppose that
we can take a linking manifold of W ′, such that S ∩ W is a submanifold of dimen-
sion 2. Then the corresponding term of the integral is RS∩W ch1E = RqW ′ 1 = ql,

i.e., we measure the charge of the sub-brane. An analogous consideration holds for
the higher Chern characters, but we have to take into account the terms of the
ˆA-genus. We just make two ﬁnal remarks. Using ordinary cohomology, in order to
compute the linking number l we must consider any solution of dGn−p−2 = δ(W )
(with q = 1) and compute the integral along L. Similarly, in the K-theoretical
picture, in order to compute the linking number of a cycle (L, u, F, ι), we consider
any solution of dGev = δ(W ) ∧ ˆA ˆK (W ) ∧ ˆA ˆK ( ˆX)− 1
2 (with E the trivial line bundle)
and compute the integral along the cycle. Then, from the previous integral, we
can compute q. Moreover, we remark that the fact that Gev ∧ ˆA ˆK(X)− 1
2 , and not
Gev itself, is K-quantized, is just a normalization analogous to 1
2π Gp in the case
of ordinary cohomology (the constant can appear depending on the conventions).
Here ˆA ˆK(X) does not depend on W , hence it is a constant with respect to a ﬁxed
