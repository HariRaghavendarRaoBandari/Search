Abstract. Laser slowing of CaF molecules down to the capture velocity of a magneto-
optical trap (MOT) for molecules is achieved.
Starting from a two-stage buﬀer
gas beam source, we apply frequency-broadened “white-light” slowing and observe
approximately 6 × 104 CaF molecules with velocities near 10 m/s. CaF is a candidate
for collisional studies in the mK regime. This work represents a signiﬁcant step towards
magneto-optical trapping of CaF.

The creation and control of samples of ultracold atoms enabled many milestones
in atomic physics, such as Bose-Einstein condensation [1, 2], quantum simulations of
many-body systems [3, 4], development of quantum information systems [5], precision
measurements and atomic clocks [6,7]. Ultracold polar molecules may advance these and
other areas of science even further, owing to the molecules’ additional degrees of freedom,
large electric dipole moments, and chemical characteristics. These properties are at the
core of many proposals and experiments [8], including quantum simulation of strongly
correlated systems [9–11], precision measurements and tests of fundamental physics
[12, 13], quantum information processing [14–16], studies of ultracold collisions [17, 18],
and control of ultracold chemical reactions [19–21]. However, a basic requirement for
many proposed experiments is trapped molecules at temperatures around 1 mK or below.
Coherent association of ultracold atoms has been successful in generating ultracold
ground state molecules at high phase-space densities [22–26]. However, this approach
so far is restricted to atomic species with easily accessible laser cooling transitions. This
method is not yet applicable to a large variety of molecules, including free radicals
such as calcium monoﬂuoride (CaF). An alternative approach is the direct cooling of
molecules. A direct cooling scheme typically starts with slowing of molecules to load a
trap, where further cooling can take place to reach ultracold temperatures.
trapping molecules,

including
electrostatic traps [27–31], magnetic traps [32–39], and magneto-optical traps (MOTs)
[40–43]. These traps are typically (cid:46) 1 K deep, and therefore a source of cold molecules
is necessary. The highest intensity source of cold and slow molecules is the buﬀer gas
beam [44–47], which utilizes collisions with an inert, cryogenic gas. However, even
these slow sources still typically inhibit direct loading of traps like a MOT since the
vast majority of molecules have velocities above the trap’s capture velocity. Hence,
an initial slowing stage is required to provide a signiﬁcant fraction of molecules that
can be trapped. At present, several groups have managed to slow molecules in various
ways [27,39,48–50], including laser cooling and radiation pressure slowing [51–53]. Here,
we present laser slowing of CaF molecules, originating from a two-stage cryogenic buﬀer-
gas beam source [45,46], to velocities around 10 m/s, which is near the expected capture
velocity of a molecular MOT for CaF.

Various approaches have been pursued for

The complex internal structure of molecules renders the use of a Zeeman slower
diﬃcult.
Instead, “white-light” slowing is used, in which spectrally broadened lasers
counter-propagate with respect to the molecular beam to address a range of velocity
classes and the internal hyperﬁne structure of the molecules, as the molecules decelerate
[51, 53]. Due to the divergence of the molecular beam, a signiﬁcant fraction of the
molecules do not reach the MOT capture volume. As a result, the total number of
molecules inside a molecular MOT has never surpassed 2000 in recent experiments
[41–43]. To realize many of the proposed applications of trapped molecules, such as
evaporation of the trapped sample in a subsequent (magnetic) trap, higher molecule
numbers are required. The most straightforward way to increase the number of molecules
that reach the MOT capture volume is to shorten the distance required for slowing,

and rotational quantum number respectively, where p = +/− denotes the parity of the
state. fij represents the Franck-Condon factor between the X (v(cid:48)(cid:48) = j) and A (v(cid:48) = i)
states from theoretical values in Ref. [54]. The value of f00 has been measured to
be 0.987 [55]. Straight lines indicate applied laser frequencies and wavy lines indicate
spontaneous emission. Transitions in the gray box are used for detecting molecules (see
text). The spin-rotation and hyperﬁne interactions of the electronic ground state X

which in turn increases the solid angle of molecules captured from the source. This
is achieved here by starting from slower initial forward velocities by using a two-stage
cryogenic buﬀer-gas beam (CBGB) source and by using a low mass molecule (which
can be decelerated over a shorter distance), at the cost of lower on-axis beam intensity
compared to a single stage source. This two-stage CBGB produces a molecular beam
with peak forward velocity of 60 m/s, more than a factor of two slower than a single-stage
buﬀer-gas beam source, and has a ﬂux of ∼ 109 molecules/steradian/state/pulse [46].
CaF is a favorable candidate for laser cooling due to its highly diagonal Franck-
Condon factors (with a measured A (v(cid:48) = 0) − X(v(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0) branching ratio of f00 =
0.987) [54, 55]. It is a 2Σ molecule which has a free electron in its outermost orbital.
This electron’s spin degree of freedom makes CaF attractive and distinct from bi-alkali
molecules. It also has a large electric dipole moment of 3 Debye. The relevant energy
levels of CaF are shown in Fig. 1. The lowest electronic excited state (A 2Π1/2) has a
lifetime of 19.2 ns [55].

We follow the laser cooling scheme reported in Ref. [51]. A CaF molecule can
scatter about 105 photons with the X(v(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0) − A(v(cid:48) = 0) (main) laser and the two
vibrational repump lasers (Fig. 1) before decaying into the higher vibrational states.
Rotational branching within each vibrational manifold is avoided by driving a P (1)
rotational transition [56]. Due to the interaction of the electron spin S = 1/2 and the
ﬂuorine’s nuclear spin I = 1/2, the rotational state splits into four hyperﬁne states.

Figure 2. Spectrum of the broadened main slowing laser. The zero of the x-axis is
set as the center of the broadened spectrum. The ﬁrst and the second repump lasers
are broadened to approximately the same width.

Each of these states need to be addressed with laser radiation to keep the molecules
in the optical cycle (Fig. 1 inset). All slowing lasers are spectrally broadened to cover
the hyperﬁne splittings in the ground states and to compensate the changing Doppler
shift as the molecules are decelerated. The maximum starting velocity of a molecule
that can be addressed in this conﬁguration is then determined by the total width of
the spectra of the slowing lasers and their interaction time with the molecules. While a
broad spectrum allows for addressing high velocities, the resulting lower power density
limits the scattering rate which, in turn, limits the deceleration rate. An alternative
approach that would maintain a higher power density is chirped slowing, which was
successfully implemented with YO [53]. This latter approach was not employed by us
as frequency chirping of the slowing laser pulses is limited by the ﬁnite bandwidth of
the laser servos (< 100 Hz).

Fig. 2 shows the spectrum of the main slowing laser. The spectrum is broadened
by two sequential phase-modulating electro-optic modulators (EOMs): One covers the
hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state with a 24.8 MHz modulation frequency with
a modulation index of ≈ 4. The second EOM is driven at a frequency of 4.5 MHz
with a modulation index of ≈ 17. This drive frequency is chosen to be about half the
excited state linewidth of 8.29 MHz to maintain the resonance condition throughout
the slowing process. The total broadening spans about 400 MHz, which covers all the
hyperﬁne splittings and the velocity change.

The overall experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 3. CaF molecules are produced
inside a 2 K cell by ablation of a vacuum hot-pressed CaF2 target with 7 mJ, 4 ns-long
pulses from a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm. The resulting CaF molecules
are cooled by collisions with cold 4He buﬀer gas and extracted toward the detection
region, which is 50 cm downstream from the cell. The slowing lasers and the molecular
beam counter-propagate. The laser light at 606 nm and 628.5 nm is generated by two
ring dye lasers. An injection-locked external cavity diode laser (ECDL) is used as the
2nd repump laser at 628 nm. Four milliseconds after the molecules are generated, the
main slowing laser is applied for a duration of 13 ms. The timing of the sequence

Figure 3. Experimental Setup (not to scale). A two-stage cell at around 2 K produces
a slow molecular beam with forward velocity of about 60 m/s. The X → A laser
orthogonal to the molecular beam and the A → C laser at 45 degrees relative to the
molecular beam intersect at 50 cm downstream where the molecules are detected. UV
photons that are emitted when the molecules decay from the C state to the X state are
detected by a photomultiplier tube. The slowing laser is sent in a direction counter-
propagating with respect to the molecular beam. Field coils to remix the dark magnetic
substates are placed between the cell and the detection region.

is chosen to prevent molecules from being slowed too early to maximize the ﬂux of
molecules that reach the detection region in spite of their ﬁnite transverse velocity. The
1st and 2nd repump lasers are applied from 2 ms to 20 ms after the ablation pulse. The
intensities of the main, the 1st repump, and the 2nd repump lasers are 260, 260, and 18
mW/cm2, respectively. Dark magnetic substates generated by optical pumping precess
about an applied transverse magnetic ﬁeld (10 Gauss) and are returned to the optical
cycle [51, 57].

A two-photon transition is used to detect the molecules. Laser light at 606 nm
is sent orthogonally to the molecular beam in the detection region, exciting molecules
from the X 2Σ(v(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0, N = 1, J = 1/2, F = 1) state to the A 2Π1/2(v(cid:48) = 0, J = 3/2, +)
state. Velocity-selective detection is performed with 729.5 nm light intersecting the
molecular beam at a 45 degree angle in the detection region (the center of our MOT
chamber). This light excites molecules in the A 2Π1/2(v(cid:48) = 0, J = 3/2, +) state to
the C 2Π1/2(v(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0, J = 1/2,−) state. UV photons are emitted at 331 nm when the
molecules decay from the C 2Π1/2 state to the X 2Σ state-manifold. These photons are
detected by a photomultiplier tube. Due to the parity selection rule, molecules decay
from the C 2Π1/2 state to the X 2Σ(v(cid:48)(cid:48) = 0, N = 0, 2) states and are lost from the optical
cycle. The 30 GHz rotational splitting between the A 2Π1/2(J = 1/2, 3/2) states makes
the detection and slowing processes independent of each other.

Fig. 4 summarizes the results of the white-light slowing of CaF molecules. We
compare the molecular laser-induced ﬂuorescence signal with and without the main
slowing laser while keeping the 1st and 2nd repump lasers on for both cases. This
removes the eﬀect of optical pumping of the naturally populated excited vibrational

states in the molecular beam. Fig. 4(a) shows the CaF beam signal with only the
repump lasers applied. The arrival time for each velocity agrees well with the time-
of-ﬂight hyperbola in the plot. When the slowing lasers are applied, molecules with
velocities as low as 10 m/s are observed (Fig. 5(b)). They arrive ahead of the predicted
time from time-of-ﬂight, indicating that they have been slowed down from a higher
initial velocity. The time-integrated signal (Fig. 5(a)) shows that slowing lasers modify
the velocity distribution of the beam: the number of molecules with speeds > 80 m/s
has decreased and that of molecules with speeds < 80 m/s has increased. It should be
noted that the white-light slowing process mainly shifts the velocity of the molecules and
does not bunch them up at a ﬁnal velocity due to the soft edge of our broadened light
spectrum. This together with the initial velocity distribution and transverse spreading
determines the ﬁnal velocity distribution.

The signal from the slowest molecules is shown in Fig. 5(b). Molecules with
velocities between 10 ± 4 m/s (which is near the expected capture velocity of a MOT
for CaF) are observed. They arrive ∼ 10 ms after they leave the cell at 2 ms, indicating
that their initial longitudinal velocity was at least 50 m/s. To within a factor of two,
using the laser-induced ﬂuorescence signal, we observe 6× 104 molecules that are slowed
down to near the MOT capture velocity. The primary contributions to the error are
light collection eﬃciency of the optics, photomultiplier tube calibration and molecular
beam ﬂuctuations.

In summary, we have demonstrated laser slowing of CaF molecules from a two-stage
buﬀer-gas beam. The slow initial velocity of our source allows slowing over a shorter
distance (≈ 20 cm); this, in turn, could lead to an overall increase in the number of
molecules captured by a MOT. Once the molecular MOT is achieved, we plan to co-trap
an atomic species to study atom-molecule collisions and the possibility of sympathetic
cooling of CaF. A promising coolant atom for this endeavour is Li, where the ratio of

shift due to the slowing lasers. (b) CaF molecules slowed down to velocities between

3000 averages. The signal at 10 m/s corresponds to approximately 6 × 104 molecules.

elastic-to-inelastic scattering rates is predicted to be favorable [58, 59]. We expect the
co-loading of an atomic species to be straightforward since it has been demonstrated that
an atomic MOT can be loaded directly from our buﬀer-gas source without additional
laser slowing [60]. Generalization of such methods to molecules may pave the way to
using ultracold molecules for probing new physics, such as the study of exotic phases
of matter using the spin degree of freedom and long-range dipole-dipole interactions of
polar molecules [11].
