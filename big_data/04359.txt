A valence bond solid (VBS) is a long-range ordered nonmagnetic state with broken lattice sym-
metries that can appear in certain quantum spin systems with competing interactions. Recent
innovations in models and simulation techniques have enabled large scale numerical studies of these
states and associated quantum phase transitions to the standard antiferromagnetic (N´eel, for two or
more dimensions) or power-law critical states (in one dimension). We here study the VBS order and
induced magnetization as a function of an external magnetic ﬁeld in a one-dimensional extended
Heisenberg model—the J-Q2 model—using the stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo
method with directed loop updates and quantum replica exchange. We ﬁnd magnetization jumps to
the fully polarized state (metamagnetism) for q ≡ Q/J ≥ qmin = 2/9 where J represents the tradi-
tional AFM Heisenberg exchange and Q represents a competing four-spin interaction. We report an
exact solution for q = qmin, where the jump ﬁrst appears, and ﬁnd that two ﬂipped spins on a fully
polarized background behave as eﬀectively noninteracting particles. For q < qmin, the ﬂipped spins
interact repulsively; for q > qmin, the spins have an attractive interaction and form a bound state.
We characterize the phases and the ﬁrst-order quantum phase transition. Using these methods, we
predict the existence of a similar magnetization jump in the J1-J2 chain with an antiferromagnetic
nearest neighbor term and a ferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor term.

INTRODUCTION

A valence bond solid (VBS, also known as a bond or-
der wave,1 a spin-Peierls phase or a dimerized phase2)
is a type of long-range-ordered nonmagnetic state ap-
pearing in certain (usually frustruated3,4) quantum spin
systems.
In a VBS, neighboring spins pair up to form
singlets, breaking translational symmetry but preserving
√
spin-rotation symmetry. Each ellipse in Fig. 1 represents
a singlet pair: (|↑↓(cid:105) − |↓↑(cid:105)) /
2. Forming a VBS breaks
the translational symmetry between the phases depicted
in Fig. 1(a) and (b). Because this symmetry is discrete,
the VBS is allowed (by the Mermin-Wagner theorem5,6)
to occur in one-dimensional systems at zero temperature.

In this paper we use an extended Heisenberg model
with four-spin interactions known as the J-Q2 model7,8
(Eq. 2) to produce a VBS and study the magnetization
process as it is subjected to an external magnetic ﬁeld
using the stochastic series expansion (SSE)8,9 quantum
monte carlo (QMC) method with with directed loops10
and quantum replica exchange (QRX).1 In the presence
of an external ﬁeld, we ﬁnd magnetization jumps (meta-
magnetism) for q ≡ Q/J ≥ qmin. Using an ansatz from
numerics, we can ﬁnd an analytical solution for qmin by
considering the case of two magnons on a saturated back-
ground and ﬁnd qmin = 2/9. Our exact solution reveals
the mechanism of the magnetization jumps: the onset
of a bound state between magnons. For q < qmin the
magnons interact repulsively, but above qmin, they have
an eﬀective attractive interaction and form a bound state.
At exactly qmin, the magnons behave as eﬀectively non-
interacting particles. Using a similar approach, we pre-
dict the existence of a metamagnetic transition brought

on by the onset of a bound state of magnons in the anti-
ferromagnetic J1-J2 chain3,4 with a ferromagnetic next-
nearest neighbor term.

The elementary quasiparticle excitations of a VBS are
gapped triplons, which correspond to breaking a singlet
pair to form a triplet, as seen in Fig. 1(c). Triplons can
in turn deconﬁne into a pair of spinons: bosonic spin-1/2
excitations that in a VBS correspond to domain walls as
shown in Fig. 1(d). For d > 1, spinons are conﬁned in
a manner similar to quarks: the energy associated with
the shifted VBS arrangement is directly proportional to
the separation between the spinons due to the interac-
tions between neighboring chains. The spinons become
deconﬁned only at the VBS phase boundary.7 In a one-
dimensional VBS, the spinons are always deconﬁned.2,11
Spinon excitations have been experimentally observed in
the 1D Heisenberg chain.12

models such as the J1-J2 model2–4,13 and has also been
observed in the extended Hubbard model.1 Generically,
the hamiltonians that produce a VBS suﬀer from the
sign problem, which prevents large scale numerical simu-
lations using QMC methods. The J-Q2 model7,8 is part of
a family of Marshall positive hamiltonians based on prod-
ucts of singlet projection operators.14 The J-Q2 model
augments a Heisenberg-like hamiltonian with a four-spin
‘Q-term’ composed of a product of two singlet projection

where hz is the strength of an external magnetic ﬁeld in
the SZ direction. We will ﬁx J = 1 and refer to the
dimensionless parameters q ≡ Q/J and h ≡ hz/J. For
h = 0, q > qc the ground state of the J-Q2-h chain is a
two-fold degenerate VBS.11 The external ﬁeld breaks the
degeneracy of the triplets |ψ−(cid:105), |ψ0(cid:105), and |ψ+(cid:105). Nonzero
magnetization of the ground state occurs when h is large
enough to bring |ψ+(cid:105) down to cross the singlet ground
state.

Magnetization jumps occurring in partially polarized
systems (also known as metamagnetism) were ﬁrst ob-
served in 196721 in FeCl2 and are commonly found in
frustrated magnetic materials.22–25 They are sometimes
attached to magnetization plateaus,26 but magnetization
jumps can also be caused by independent (i.e. noninter-
acting) magnetic excitations.27–29 Magnons can become
independent through localization: frustration-induced lo-
calization can prevent individual magnons from inter-
acting with one another, allowing for a magnetization
jump.27–29 In this paper, we show explicitly that the
mechanism responsible for the magnetization jumps in
the J-Q2-h chain is the onset of eﬀective attractive inter-
actions between magnons. In the regime without mag-
netization jumps, magnons (on a ferromagnetic back-
ground) interact repulsively. At the onset of the jump
(q = qmin), low densities of magnons behave as nonin-
teracting particles, although unlike in the previous case,
they are not localized.

II. METHODS

series

expansion (SSE) quantum monte

The primary numerical tools used for this work
are Lanczos exact diagonalization and the stochas-
tic
carlo
method9 with directed loop updates.10 SSE works by
mapping a d-dimensional quantum problem onto a
(d + 1)-dimensional classical problem through Taylor ex-
pansion of e−βH , where the extra dimension corresponds
a product of terms of the hamiltonian. This dimension
is related to imaginary time in a manner similar to a
path integral, but with the emphasis is not on the paths
but on the operators determiming the ﬂuctuations of the
paths. Diagonal updates insert and remove two and four
spin diagonal operators, while the directed loop updates
change the operators from diagonal to oﬀ-diagonal (and
vice-versa).8 When a loop encounters a two-spin oper-
ator, we choose the exit leg using the solution of the
directed loop equations for the Heisenberg model in an
external ﬁeld found by Sylju˚asen et. al.10 When encoun-
tering a four-spin Q-type operator, the exit leg is chosen
using a deterministic “switch and reverse” strategy (es-
sentially identical to the Heisenberg SSE algorithm8).

Using SSE alone, we found that simulations sometimes
become stuck at a metastable magnetization. This can
prevent simulations from reaching equilibrium and make
it diﬃcult to compute accurate estimates of statistical
errors. This problem can be easily seen in our prelimi-
nary results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 of Ref. 30, where
the signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations are due to this ‘sticking’ prob-
lem. To remedy this, we used a variation of the replica
exchange method known as quantum replica exchange
(QRX),1 implemented using MPI.

In the traditional replica exchange method31 (also
known as parallel tempering), many simulations are run
in parallel on a mesh of temperatures.
In addition to
standard monte carlo updates, replicas are allowed to
swap temperatures with each other with some probabil-
ity that preserves detailed balance. This allows a replica
in a metastable state to escape by wandering to a higher
temperature. Thus, replica exchange is a form of simu-
lated annealing.

In QRX simulations (also known as quantum parallel
tempering),1 we run M independent simulations in par-
allel, but instead of using diﬀerent temperatures, we use
diﬀerent values of some other parameter. In our case, we
used a mesh of magnetic ﬁelds. After each monte carlo
sweep, we allow replicas to exchange magnetic ﬁelds with
one another in a manner that preserves detailed balance.
Quantum replica exchange is a rare parallel algorithm
that oﬀers superlinear speedup. Using monte carlo sim-
ulations to collect data over a set of diﬀerent parame-
ters is already an example of an ‘embarrassingly parallel’
problem. For relatively little communications overhead,
quantum replica exchange dramatically reduces autocor-
relation times, thus allowing simulations of much larger
systems at much lower temperatures.

In practice, adding additional replicas slows down the

simulation in part because the time required to complete
a monte carlo sweep varies according to some distribution
and all the replicas have to wait for the slowest replica to
ﬁnish before continuing. This slowdown can be somewhat
alleviated by running two replicas on each core. This can
cut the number of cores required in half without signiﬁ-
cantly increasing wall clock time.

III. PHASE DIAGRAM

We begin in Fig. 2 with a schematic phase diagram
assembled from the literature and our own calculations.
The axes of Fig. 2 are well studied; the oﬀ-axes area is
the topic of this paper. The q-axis corresponds to the
previously-studied zero-ﬁeld J-Q2 model:11 for q < qc,
there is a Heisenberg-like critical N´eel state with 1/r
correlations;32 at q = qc the chain undergoes a phase
transition to a VBS, similar to the Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition11,15 and identical to the quasi-N´eel to VBS
transition in the J1-J2 chain.2 The h axis is the standard
Heisenberg chain in a magnetic ﬁeld.

There are three phases: in red, there is a fully polarized
phase; in blue, a VBS; and in teal, a supposed partially-
polarized critical XY phase. If we start from a VBS state
(h = 0, q > qc) and add a magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬁeld will
‘pull down’ triplet excitations. These triplet pairs will
deconﬁne into spinons,11,12 and destroy the VBS. Each
spinon is a domain wall between VBS-ordered states, so
few should be required to destroy the long-range order.
The phase boundary extending from qc should follow the
gap to excite a single triplet out of the VBS. We expect
the destruction of the VBS to yield a partially polarized
state with critical XY correlations, as in the standard
AFM Heisenberg chain in an external ﬁeld. We here do
not focus on this part of the phase diagram and will not

discuss the exact form of the VBS-XY phase boundary.
We focus mainly on the line hc(q) separating the XY
and saturated phases in Fig. 2. Along the dotted portion
the magnetization curve is continuous. The solid portion
denotes the presence of a magnetization jump, a ﬁrst
order quantum phase transition known as the metamag-
netic transition. The point qmin represents the minimum
value of q that produces a jump. At q = qmin, the jump is
inﬁnitesimal (mc = 1, ∆m = 0) and χm diverges exactly
at saturation.

for periodic chains from L = 8 to L = 256 for
q = 1.2(> qc ≈ 0.85), with inverse temperature β = L/4.
In Fig. 3 we observe two distinct phases: a paramagnetic
regime and a fully polarized state separated by a sharp
jump (the metamagnetic transition). The magnetization
curves exhibit near perfect agreement for all sizes stud-
ied, limited only by the discretized values of m for each
size (visible in greater detail in the inset).
In Fig. 4, we plot the m(h) over a range of diﬀerent
values of 0 ≤ q ≤ 1.2, with L = 96 and β = 12. At q = 0
(the Heisenberg limit) there is no jump and the system is
most easily magnetized. As q is increased, a small jump
appears and grows with increasing q. The critical ﬁeld,
hc, increases monotonically with q as one would expect.
As in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 exhibits no signs of a magnetization
plateau.

FIG. 5. Critical magnetic ﬁeld (to produce saturation) for the
L = 30 periodic chain. The dot indicates qmin.

This jump shows many hallmarks of a ﬁrst order phase
transition, including hysteresis (as documented in our
earlier report30). Despite the use of quantum replica ex-
change, it was diﬃcult to extract precise results for hc
or mc from QMC due to the tendency of simulations to
get stuck in metastable states near the transition30 (itself
characteristic of ﬁrst order phase transitions). Although
the use of QRX has drastically reduced this problem, it is
still apparent for large chains and at lower temperatures.
To extract the critical magnetic ﬁeld (hc) we used lanc-
zos diagonalization of a 30-site chain. The external ﬁeld
commutes with the hamiltonian, so we can solve the zero-
ﬁeld J-Q2 model in the SZ basis and add the contribution
from the ﬁeld in afterwards. We determined the critical
magnetic ﬁeld for L = 30 and plotted these data in Fig. 5.
For q ≤ qmin, hc has no dependence on q, as expected. In
this regime, hc is determined by a level crossing between

the m = S and m = S − 1 states, both of which are inde-
pendent of both q and L (Eqs. 7 and 12a,b). There are no
ﬁnite size corrections at the qmin point either, the reason
for this will be discussed in the next section. Finally, for
q > qmin, we ﬁnd a positive relationship between hc and
q, consistent with our QMC results in Fig. 4.

Metamagnetism has also been observed in a study of
the frustrated ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain (FFHC).33
Speciﬁcally, there is a sequence of multipolar phases.
If such phases existed near qmin, we would observe a
‘cascade’ of jumps. First, the smallest possible jump
of ∆mz = 2 would appear, but then for slightly larger
values of q > qmin, there should be a series other size-
independent jumps, ∆mz = 3, 4, 5... until at some point,
there would be a ﬁnal transition to a jump of ﬁnite size
in the thermodynamic limit. Based on exact diagonaliza-
tion of chains up to L = 28, we see no evidence of such
an eﬀect in the 1D J-Q2 model.

tizations. For mz > 0, D(r) develops long-wavelength
oscillations with a wavelength proportional to the in-
verse magnetization density λ ∝ 1/m (a similar eﬀect
was observed by Haldane34), but we ﬁnd no evidence for
a symmetry-broken state. There was no evidence for a
symmetry broken state in the SZ spin correlations either,
which develop a similar pattern of long-wavelength oscil-
lations. We also tried using open boundary conditions

V. ORIGIN OF THE JUMP

Magnetization jumps (metamagnetism) have been pre-
viously observed in the isotropic25,35 and anisotropic
J1-J2 chain.22–24 Magnetization jumps have also been ob-
served attached to magnetization plateaus.26 Magnetiza-
tion plateaus indicate the presence of a gap between dif-
ferent spin states and are allowed (by an extension of the
Lieb-Shultz-Mattis Theorem) only when the magnetiza-
tion per unit cell, m, obeys (S − m) = integer.36 In the
absence of broken symmetries, magnetization plateaus
are forbidden in S=1/2 chains.

The magnetization jump comes out of the XY phase
which has full translational symmetry.
If mc corre-
sponded to some sort of special arrangement of bonds
and unpaired spins (breaking translational symmetry),
we would expect to see some sign of translational sym-
metry breaking such as magnetization plateau or a signa-
ture in the spin or bond correlation functions, which in
Fig. 6, we clearly do not. Thus, magnetization plateaus
are forbidden, and unsurprisingly, we ﬁnd no evidence for
such a plateau the magnetization in Figs. 3 and 4.

Having ruled out broken lattice symmetries, one might
also imagine that the jump is some measure of the typical
size of spinons themselves. In the zero-ﬁeld VBS spinons
are well deﬁned particles with an exponential wavepacket
P (r) ∝ e−r/λ, with λ roughly equal to twice the spin
correlation length.11 In the critical XY phase we should
expect spinons to be fully delocalized,11 thus spinons are
not a good set of excitations to consider near the mag-
netization jump.

Magnetization jumps can also be caused by magnons
In previ-
becoming independent (i.e. noninteracting).
ous studies, localization of magnons has been shown to
cause magnetization jumps by making it possible to pack
more magnetic excitations into the lattice without them
‘touching’. We will now show that the magnetization
jump in the J-Q2 chain (and later, the J1-J2 chain) is
caused by the onset of an eﬀective attractive interaction
between magnons.

At higher values of magnetization, this short range at-
tractive force may dominate, causing the gas of magnetic
excitations to suddenly condense, producing a magneti-
zation jump. Indeed, when conﬁned to a nonequilibrium
value of magnetization (for example, m = 1/2, q = 1.2),
we observed phase separation: the chain would separate
into a section with magnetization density mc and another
section that was fully polarized.

Using an analytical approach, we were able to derive
qmin, the minimum value of q required to produce a jump
(see Fig. 2) using exact diagonalization of small systems
and an analytical approach. We begin with the fact that
the jump is always to the saturated state and assume that
in the inﬁnite chain limit, the size of the jump goes to

5

zero at qmin. In an inﬁnite system, the smallest possible
jump is inﬁnitesimal; in this case the ‘jump’ corresponds
to a divergence of the magnetic susceptibility. For any
ﬁnite system, the magnetization will always have triv-
ial jumps of ∆mz = 1; therefore the smallest nontrivial
jump is ∆mz = 2. If we assume the jump is to the fully
polarized state, then the smallest nontrivial jump is from
z = S − 2 directly to mf
mi
z = S (where S = L/2), i.e. a
direct level crossing between mz = S − 2 and mz = S.
If we can ﬁnd no such level crossing, then we know that
either qmin = 0, or one of our assumptions has failed.

To determine if such a crossing occurs in the ther-
modynamic limit we must calculate E(mz, J, Q, L) for
mz = S, S − 1, S − 2. The fully polarized state is triv-
ial: there are no places for a singlet projection opera-
tor to act, so H |mz = S(cid:105) = −hS.
If we add a single
spin-down site (magnon), the Heisenberg term on pro-
duces a tight-binding-like eﬀective hamiltonian on this
down spin: the diagonal terms give it an on-site energy
and the oﬀ-diagonal terms allow it to hop to neighboring
sites. A Q-term cannot act on this single-magnon state.
The one magnon state is a one-body problem with the
analytic solution:

E1 = − J(1 + cos k) − h(S − 1)

(7)

With periodic boundary conditions, the ground state for
all L has k = 0, thus E1 = −2J − h(S − 1), independent
of L.

For the two-magnon case, consider a basis of the center
of mass position and the distance between the spin-down
|X ≡ x2 + x1, r ≡ x2 − x1(cid:105). The hamiltonian is
sites:
translation-invariant for the center-of-mass coordinate,
X, so we can consider momentum states: |K, r(cid:105). We will
assume that the ground state has zero center-of-mass mo-
mentum and reduce the basis to the separation between
the spin-down sites: |r(cid:105). For example,
|r = 1(cid:105) =|··· ↑↑↓↓↑↑ ···(cid:105)
|r = 2(cid:105) =|··· ↑↑↓↑↓↑↑ ···(cid:105)
|r = 3(cid:105) =|··· ↑↑↓↑↑↓↑↑ ···(cid:105)

(8a)
(8b)
(8c)

We have taken a problem of two magnons with periodic
boundary conditions and transformed it into a problem
of a single particle in a box with L − 1 sites and open
boundary conditions.

Now consider how the Heisenberg term acts in this
basis. For r > 1, the result is very similar to the one
magnon problem: there are two ways to hop the magnons
toward each other, two ways to hop them away from each
other, and four ways to leave them where they are, each
with magnitude −J/2:

HJ |r > 1(cid:105) = −2J |r(cid:105) − J |r − 1(cid:105) − J |r + 1(cid:105)

(9)

For r = 1, there are two slight modiﬁcations: the spin
down sites are hardcore bosons—they cannot hop across
each other—and the on-site potential is only −J.

HJ |r = 1(cid:105) = −J |1(cid:105) − J |2(cid:105)

Somewhat counterintuitively, the Q-term produces an ef-
fective attractive interaction by lowering the energy of
states where the ﬂipped spins are separated by no more
than three lattice spacings.

Now we have the energies of each magnetization sector:

ES = − hS
E1 = ¯E1(J, Q, L) − h(S − 1)
E2 = ¯E2(J, Q, L) − h(S − 2)

(12a)

(12b)

(12c)

where ¯E2 is the ground state energy of the zero-ﬁeld two
magnon chain. In order to ﬁnd qmin, we must ﬁrst ﬁnd
hc by demanding that ES = E2:

hc = − 1
2

(13)
To guarantee a direct level crossing between mz = S − 2
and mz = S, require E1 ≥ ES = E2:

¯E2(J, Q, L)

−hcS ≤ ¯E1 − hc(S − 1)

hc ≥ − ¯E1

(14)

(15)

Combining Eqs. 13 and 15 and eliminating hc, we ﬁnd a
condition for qmin:

¯E2 ≤ 2 ¯E1

(16)

This condition is also essentially the condition for an at-
tractive interaction: the energy for two magnons is less
than twice the energy of one magnon. From Eq. 7, we
know that ¯E1 = −2J, so we can ﬁnd a condition on ¯E2
for the existence of a jump:

¯E2 ≤ −4J

(17)

In Fig. 7 we plot ¯E2(J = 1, Q = q), we can deter-
mine qmin by ﬁnding the value of q that satisﬁes Eq. 17.
Surprisingly, we found qmin = 0.¯2 = 2/9 to machine pre-
cision for all L > 6. For q < qmin, ﬁnite size eﬀects result
in an overestimate of the thermodynamic limit of ¯E2, for
q > qmin, they result in an underestimate. At exactly
q = qmin, these eﬀects cancel and ¯E2 becomes indepen-
dent of L (for L > 6). Note that qmin < qc (the VBS
transition); we shouldn’t expect qc and qmin to match
since the magnetization jump occurs not from the VBS
but from the critical XY state.

FIG. 8. (Color online) The probability of the particles being
separated by a given distance (P (r) = (cid:104)ψ0(r)|ψ0(r)(cid:105)) for the
two-magnon sector (mz = S − 2) in the J-Q2 chain.

In Fig. 8, we plot the probability density (|ψ0(r)|2)
in the separation basis for L = 40 for several values
of q. For q < qmin, the magnons scatter oﬀ one an-
other with a ﬁnite-range eﬀective repulsive interaction,
and the wavefunction of their separation (in a center of
mass frame) takes on the form of a particle in a box.
For q > qmin, the magnons scatter with a ﬁnite-range
eﬀective attractive interaction, in this case the wavefunc-
tion is strongly peaked at small separations, indicating a
bound state. At q = qmin, magnons cross between these
two regimes. The wavefunction is exactly constant in
the bulk (3 < r < L − 3). They scatter oﬀ one another
acquiring no phase and thus, their wavefunctions and
ground state energy resemble that of two noninteracting
magnons, with ¯E2(J, Qmin) = 2 · (−2J). As q → qmin
from above, the expectation value of the separation be-
tween them diverges. The onset of this bound state is

The absence of ﬁnite size eﬀects, the fact that qmin is
a ratio of small whole numbers and the ﬂat wavefunction
in the bulk are remarkable and suggested that there may
be an analytic solution for q = qmin. Using the separa-
tion basis and setting J = 1, Q = q, we can write the
hamiltonian as:

Using the numerics as inspiration, we will assume that

the ground state will have the form:

|ψ(cid:105) =

where N is some normalization factor. The wavefunction
is constant in the bulk, but the three edge states on each
side have weights a, b, c. Acting on |ψ(cid:105) with H in Eq. 18
produces a set of ﬁve equations which can be solved for

studied.22,23,25,37–39 Several papers have produced evi-
dence of metamagnetism in the J1-J2 chain for in the
isotropic25,35 and anisotropic22–24 cases. Naively, a FM
NNN term does not produce frustration, since it would
serve to strengthen FM or AFM order. Probably for
this reason, this particular combination of parameters
has apparently been overlooked in the literature. Some
papers37,38 have looked at the case where the NNN
term is FM, but none of them have looked for meta-
magnetism. Since the AFM Q-term in the J-Q2 model
acts as an eﬀective FM interaction for low densities of
magnons it seemed natural to look for metamagnetism
for J1 > 0, J2 < 0. We will now show that in this
case there is an onset of a bound state of magnons for
j ≡ −J2/J1 > jmin. A similar approach has been used
by Kecke et. al.25 for the FM-AFM J1-J2 chain.

First, consider the one-magnon case in a basis of x,
the position of a single down spin on a ferromagnetic
background. The contribution from the J1 is identical
to the J-term in the JQh model, the J2 term is similar,
except that it hops the ﬂipped spin by two sites instead
of one:

H |x(cid:105) = − (J1 + J2)|x(cid:105) − J1
2

(|x − 1(cid:105) + |x + 1(cid:105))

− J2
2

(|x − 2(cid:105) + |x + 2(cid:105))

(22)

Acting with H on a momentum state, we ﬁnd the single
magnon energy:

¯E1(k) = − J1(1 + cos k) − J2(1 + cos 2k)

(23)

We will restrict ourselves to the AFM NN and FM

NNN case ﬁnd that energy is therefore minimized by:

(cid:40)0

¯k∗(j) =

(cid:17)

j ≤ 1/4
j ≥ 1/4

where J1 = 1, J2 = −j, a positive constant deﬁned:

j ≡ − J2

If we plug back into Eq. 23 the ground state energy of
the one-magnon case is given by:

j ≤ 1/4
j ≥ 1/4

Now we can proceed to the case two magnons on a chain with L sites using a basis of the positions of each ﬂipped

spin x, y. Proceeding in a manner almost identical to the J-Q2 chain, for |x − y| > 2:

H |x, y(cid:105) = −2(J1 + J2)|x, y(cid:105) − J1
2

(|x + 1, y(cid:105) + |x − 1, y(cid:105) + |x, y + 1(cid:105) + |x, y − 1(cid:105))
− J2(|x + 2, y(cid:105) + |x − 2, y(cid:105) + |x, y + 2(cid:105) + |x, y − 2(cid:105))

for y = x + 2:

H |x, x + 2(cid:105) = −(2J1 + J2)|x, x + 2(cid:105) − J1
2
− J2
2

(|x + 1, x + 2(cid:105) + |x − 1, x + 2(cid:105) + |x, x + 3(cid:105) + |x, x + 1(cid:105))
(|x − 2, x + 2(cid:105) + |x, x + 4(cid:105))

and for y = x + 1:

H |x, x + 1(cid:105) = −(J1 + 2J2)|x, x + 1(cid:105) − J1
2
− J2
2

(|x − 1, x + 1(cid:105) + |x, x + 2(cid:105))
(|x + 2, x + 1(cid:105) + |x − 2, x + 1(cid:105) + |x, x + 4(cid:105) + |x, x − 1(cid:105))

(28)

(29)

(30)

As before, the center of mass momentum commutes with the hamiltonian, we can rewrite these equations in terms

of a basis |X ≡ x + y, r ≡ y − x(cid:105). For r > 2

H |X, r(cid:105) = −2(J1 + J2)|X, r(cid:105) − J1

− J2

(|X + 1(cid:105) + |X − 1(cid:105)) ⊗ (|r + 1(cid:105) + |r − 1(cid:105))
(|X + 2(cid:105) + |X − 2(cid:105)) ⊗ (|r + 2(cid:105) + |r − 2(cid:105))

H |X, r = 2(cid:105) = −(2J1 + J2)|X, r(cid:105) − J1

− J2

(|X + 1(cid:105) + |X − 1(cid:105)) ⊗ (|r + 1(cid:105) + |r − 1(cid:105))
(|X + 2(cid:105) + |X − 2(cid:105)) ⊗ |r + 2(cid:105)

and r = 2:

and r = 1:

H |X, r = 1(cid:105) = −(J1 + 2J2)|X, r(cid:105) − J1

− J2
2

(|X + 1(cid:105) + |X − 1(cid:105)) ⊗ |r + 1(cid:105)

(31)

(33)

bearing mind that r = −1 must wrap around the periodic boundary conditions to r = L − 1.

Now we want to convert to momentum states in X using |K(cid:105) ≡(cid:80)

e−KX |X(cid:105) and then multiply each equation by

|K(cid:105)(cid:104)K|, which commutes straight through H yielding:

X

H |K, r(cid:105) = |K(cid:105) ⊗ [−2(J1 + J2)|r(cid:105) − J1 cos K(|r + 1(cid:105) + |r − 1(cid:105)) − J2 cos(2K)(|r + 2(cid:105) + |r − 2(cid:105))]

H |K, r = 2(cid:105) = |K(cid:105) ⊗ [−(2J1 + J2)|r(cid:105) − J1 cos K(|r + 1(cid:105) + |r − 1(cid:105)) − J2 cos(2K)|r + 2(cid:105)]
H |K, r = 1(cid:105) = |K(cid:105) ⊗ [−(J1 + 2J2)|r(cid:105) − J1 cos K |r + 1(cid:105) − J2 cos(2K)(|r + 2(cid:105) + |L − 1(cid:105))]

In Fig. 9 we diagonalize HJ1−J2 numerically to ﬁnd
¯E2(j, K) for J1 = 1 (AFM) and j ≡ −J2/J1 (FM). Note
that the ground state always has zero center-of-mass mo-
mentum, K.

Let’s solve the eigenvalue problem for the bulk (r > 2):

HJ1−J2 has eigenstates of the form and energy:

ψp(r) =

¯E2(K, p) = − 2J1 [1 + cos K cos p]

− 2J2 [1 + cos(2K) cos(2p)]

(AFM) and j ≡ −J2/J1 (FM).

where p is the ‘radial’ or separation r, momentum coor-
dinate. For an AFM NN term J1 = 1, we know from
numerics (Fig. 9) that K = 0 will minimize the energy,
so let’s rewrite Eq. 36 for K = 0, J1 = 1 and j ≡ −J2/J1
(ferromagnetic NNN):

¯E2(p, j) = − 2 − 2 cos p + 2j + 2j cos 2p

Once again, at j = 1

¯E2(p, j = 1/4) = − 3 +

and equal to exactly twice the one-magnon energy ¯E1,
Eq. 27.

To ﬁnd determine if there is a jump, we can use the

same criterion we derived for the J-Q2 chain: Eq. 16

chain of length L = 1000. For j <∼ 0.23, the 2 ¯E1 ≈ ¯E2,
as we would expect from the inﬁnite chain limit. Due to
ﬁnite-size eﬀects, ¯E2 is slightly greater than 2 ¯E1, which is
consistent with the idea that the two magnons are inter-
acting repulsively, therefore the energy of two magnons is
slightly more than twice the energy of a single magnon.
For j >∼ 0.23, we have evidence of the onset of an eﬀective
attractive interaction; ¯E1 matches our analytical solution
in Eq. 26 and the energy of the two-magnon state is less
than twice the energy of a single magnon. We suspect
this crossover should approach jmin → 1/4 in the ther-
modynamic limit. The onset of this attractive interaction
should result in a magnetization jump (metamagnetism).
Therefore, we predict the existence of a magnetization
jump to saturation in the AFM-FM J1-J2 chain for

j ≥ jmin = 1/4

VII. CONCLUSIONS

First let’s examine the inﬁnite-chain limit. For an inﬁnite
chain:

(cid:40)−2 + 2j
(cid:40)−4 + 4j

−1 − 1

¯E1(j) =

¯E2(j) =

j ≤ 1/4
j ≥ 1/4
j ≤ 1/4
j ≥ 1/4

¯E2(j)

Unfortunately, we cannot use the same trick from the
J-Q2 chain to get the two-magnon energy analytically, so
¯E2(j > 1/4) has to be determined numerically.

We determined ¯E2(j > 1/4) by directly diagonalizing
ﬁnite-size hamiltonians. Since the size of the hamilto-
nian only scales like L, we can solve very long chains
(L > 1000) easily.
In Fig. 10 we present exact diago-
nalization results for one and two magnons on a periodic

In this paper we have studied the J-Q2 chain in the
presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. We have estab-
lished the existence of a magnetization jump (metamag-
netic transition) to the saturated state for q ≥ qmin =
2/9. The magnetization jump begins with zero mag-
nitude at q = qmin and increases gradually in magni-
tude as q increases. This jump is a ﬁrst-order quan-
tum phase transition. Below this critical point, qmin,
magnons interact with ﬁnite-range eﬀectively repulsive
interaction. Above this critical point, magnons interact
with a ﬁnite range attractive interaction, despite all terms
in the hamiltonian being antiferromagnetic. Exactly at
the critical point, magnons become noninteracting (for
suﬃciently low density) and the problem of two magnons
on a ferromagnetic background can be solve analytically.
We have predicted that the same mechanism will pro-
duce a magnetization jump to saturation in the AFM-FM

AFM-FM J1-J2 chain is not frustrated in the conven-
tional sense, since the ferromagnetic J2 term has the ef-
fect of reinforcing the ground state correlations, yet in the
presence of a ﬁeld it is responsible for the development
of a magnetization jump. To our knowledge, no one has
attempted to ﬁnd metamagnetism in the AFM-FM J1-J2
chain, and this would be an excellent topic for a future
study using DMRG or some other method well suited to
one dimension. Indeed, the AFM-FM J1-J2 chain may be
understudied due to its lack of conventional frustration.
The methods (QMC and exact) developed for this work
are now being expanded to study the 2D JQ2 model in
the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld. We expect to ﬁnd that
there is also a magnetization jump in two dimensions
driven by a similar mechanism.
