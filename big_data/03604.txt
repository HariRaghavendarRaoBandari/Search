Abstract. For an algebraic curve X deﬁned over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of char-
acteristic p > 0, the a-number a(X ) is the dimension of the space of exact holomorphic
diﬀerentials on X . We compute the a-number for an inﬁnite families of Fermat and
Hurwitz curves. Our results apply to Hermitian curves giving a new proof for a previous
result of Gross [9].

1. Introduction

In this paper, X is a (projective, geometrically irreducible, algebraic) curve deﬁned over
an algebraically closed ﬁeld K of characteristic p > 0. The relevant geometric properties
of X are encoded in its birational invariants, the most important being the genus, the
automorphism group, and the p-rank. The latter one is the number of independent un-
ramiﬁed abelian p-extensions of the function ﬁeld K(X ); equivalently, it is the dimension
of the Fp-vector space of the p-torsion points of the Jacobian of the curve, as well as, the
dimension of the span of the vectors in the space of holomorphic diﬀerentials that are ﬁxed
under the action of the Cartier operator.

In recent years, a further birational invariant of an algebraic curve related to the Cartier
operator has attracted much attention, namely the a-number a(X ) deﬁned to be the
dimension of the kernel of the Cartier operator, alternatively the dimension of the space
of exact holomorphic diﬀerentials. As a matter of fact, the a-number is also a relevant
invariant of the p-torsion of the Jacobian of the curve; see [14].

Computing the a-number of a curve may be a rather challenging task. In fact, the exact
value of the a-number is known just for a few families of curves; see for instance [2], [3],
[4], [5], [9]. For this purpose, a Deuring-Shafarevich type formula for the a-number would
be useful, but it is not known whether such a generalization exists.

In this paper, we consider Fermat and Hurwitz curves, where a Fermat curve Fn is the
nonsingular plane curve of aﬃne equation X n+Y n+1 = 0 with p ∤ n, while a Hurwitz curve
Hn is the nonsingular plane curve of aﬃne equation X nY + Y n + X = 0 with p ∤ n2 − n + 1.
There is a vast literature on Fermat and Hurwitz curves, especially in the case where their
number of rational points over some ﬁnite ﬁeld reaches the famous Hasse-Weil bound; see
[1] and [18]. Our main result is to compute the a-numbers of Fermat and Hurwitz curves
for inﬁnite values of n. Since Hermitian curves are particular Fermat curves, our results
apply to Hermitian curves giving a new proof for Gross’ result [9].

Kodama and Washio [13], Gonz´alez [7], Price and Weir [16] and previously Yui [21]
obtained a few results on the ranks of the Cartier operator (and hence on the a-number) of
Fermat curves. We will point out that our results are independent from their investigation,
and in several cases are more general; see Remark 5.2.

An essential tool in our investigation is a formula for the Cartier operator due to St¨ohr
and Voloch [19]. As far as we know, such a formula has not been applied previously to
the study of a-numbers.

2. The Cartier Operator

Let K(X ) be the function ﬁeld of a curve X of genus g deﬁned over an algebraically
closed ﬁeld K of characteristic p > 0. A separating variable for K(X ) is an element
x ∈ K(X ) \ K(X )p. Any function f ∈ K(X ) can be written uniquely in the form

f = up

p−1xp−1,

0 + up

1x + . . . + up

where ui ∈ K(X ) for i = 0, . . . , p − 1. Let Ω1 be the sheaf of diﬀerential 1-forms on X .
Then Ω1 is a 1-dimensional vector space over K(X ). Hence

for any ω ∈ Ω1. The Cartier operator C : Ω1 → Ω1 is a 1/p-linear map deﬁned by

ω = f dx

C(f dx) = up−1dx.

By a Theorem of Tate, C does not depend on the choice of x; see [20]. A diﬀerential ω
is holomorphic if div(ω) is eﬀective. The set H 0(X , Ω1) of holomorphic diﬀerentials is a
g-dimensional K-vector subspace of Ω1 such that C(H 0(X , Ω1)) ⊆ H 0(X , Ω1). It can be
shown that C is the unique map such that the following properties are satisﬁed:

(i) C(ω1 + ω2) = C(ω1) + C(ω2),
(ii) C(f pω) = f C(ω),
(iii) C(ω) = 0 if and only if ω is exact,
(iv) C(f p−1df ) = df ,
(v) C(ω) = ω if and only if ω is logarithmic,

where a diﬀerential ω is exact if ω = df for some f ∈ K(X ) ([10]), logarithmic if ω = df /f
In this context, two subspaces of H 0(X , Ω1) are relevant: the semisimple
for f 6= 0.
subspace H 0(X , Ω1)s and the nilpotent subspace H 0(X , Ω1)n. The former is spanned by
the holomorphic logarithmic diﬀerentials, the latter is formed by diﬀerentials ω such that
there exists n ∈ N for which Cn(Ω) = 0. By a Theorem of Hasse and Witt, H 0(X , Ω1) =
H 0(X , Ω1)s ⊕ H 0(X , Ω1)n; see [10]. Also, by a classical result, the p-rank γ(X ) of X equals
the dimension of H 0(X , Ω1)s; see [17].

The dimension a(X ) of the kernel of C (or equivalently, the dimension of the space of
exact holomorphic diﬀerentials on X ) is the a-number of X . Then 0 ≤ a(X ) + γ(X ) ≤ g.
Also, if a(X ) = g(X ), then γ(X ) = 0, and vice versa. The a-number arises as an invariant
of the p-torsion subgroup of J (X ); however, knowledge of a(X ) may give information
about the Jacobian itself.
In particular, it can be shown that the number of factors
appearing in the decompostion of J (X ) into simple principally polarized abelian varieties
is at most γ(X ) + a(X ); see [4].

Let B = {ω1, . . . , ωg} be a basis of H 0(X , Ω1). Then for any ω ∈ H 0(X , Ω1),

C(ω) =

g

The matrix A(X ) = (a1/p

ij ) is the Hasse-Witt (or Cartier-Manin) matrix of X .

The a-number a(X ) is the co-rank of A(X ) (or, equivalently, of Ap(X ) = (aij)). Because

of 1/p-linearity, the operator Cn is represented with respect to B by the matrix

Also, the p-rank γ(X ) coincides with the rank of the matrix

(aij)(a1/p

ij ) . . . (a1/pn−1

ij

).

(aij)(a1/p

ij ) . . . (a1/pg−1

ij

).

The Cartier operator is related to the number X (Fq) of points of X over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq,
as the following theorem shows; see [6].

Theorem 2.1. Let X be a curve deﬁned over a ﬁnite ﬁeld with q2 elements, where q = pn
for some n ∈ N. If X is Fq2-maximal (or Fq2-minimal), then Cn = 0.

The Cartier operator may be identically zero on H 0(X , Ω1). In this case, X is superspe-
cial; see [15]. If X is superspecial, then a(X ) = g(X ). In particular, superspecial curves
have zero p-rank. The Jacobian J (X ) of a superspecial curve is isomorphic to a product
of g supersingular elliptic curves.

In [19], St¨ohr and Voloch gave a formula for the action of the Cartier operator C on a

plane curve X . We now summarize their main results.

Let Y be a plane model of X given by an aﬃned equation Y : F (X, Y ) = 0 with
an irreducible polynomial F ∈ K[X, Y ] of degree n > 3. Then K(Y) = K(x, y) with
F (x, y) = 0. If Y has only ordinary singularities, its canonical adjoints are the curves of
formal degree n − 3 with at least an (r − 1)-fold point at every r-fold point of Y; see [11,
Theorem 6.50]. If Y is nonsingular, any curve of formal degree n − 3 is an adjoint. In
the general case, the local conditions for the canonical adjoints can be expressed in terms
of the conductors of the local rings; see [8]. The canonical adjoints form a g-dimensional
K-vector space; see [11, Theorem 6.55]. The following theorem is due to Gorenstein; see
[8, Theorem 12].

Theorem 2.2. A diﬀerential ω ∈ Ω1 is holomorphic if and only if it is of the form
(h(x, y)/Fy )dx, where H : h(X, Y ) = 0 is a canonical adjoint.

In particular, the Cartier operator C acts on the canonical adjoints; see [19, Theorem

1.1].

Theorem 2.3. With the above assumptions,

Remark 2.4. The diﬀerential operator ∇ deﬁned by

and hence ∇ maps polynomials into p-th powers of polynomials. By Theorem 2.3, the
action of C on the canonical adjoints is given by

h 7→ (∇(F p−1h))

3. The a-number of Fermat curves

Since the Fermat curve Fn is nonsingular,

{xiyj | i + j ≤ n − 3}

is a basis for the space of canonical adjoints of Fn. Then by Theorem 2.2, a basis for the
space H 0(Fn, Ω1) of holomorphic diﬀerentials on Fn is

B = {(xiyj/nyn−1)dx | i + j ≤ n − 3}.

Theorem 3.1. The rank of the Cartier operator C on the Fermat curve Fn equals the
number of pairs (i, j) with i + j ≤ n − 3 such that the system of congruences mod p

(2)

(cid:26) n(p − 1 − h) + i ≡ p − 1

nk + j ≡ p − 1

has a solution (h, k) for 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1, 0 ≤ k ≤ h.

Proof. By Theorem 2.3, C((xiyj/Fy)dx) = (∇(F p−1xiyj))1/pdx/Fy. Therefore, we apply
the diﬀerential operator ∇ to

(xn + yn − 1)p−1xiyj =

From the formula in Remark 2.4, ∇((xn + yn − 1)p−1xiyj) 6= 0 if and only if some (h, k),

with 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1 and 0 ≤ k ≤ h, satisﬁes both the following congruences mod p:

(4)

(cid:26) n(p − 1 − h) + i ≡ p − 1

nk + j ≡ p − 1

.

Take (i, j) 6= (i0, j0) in such a way that both ∇((xn+yn−1)xiyj) and ∇((xn+yn−1)xi0yj0)
are nonzero. We claim that they are linearly independent over K. To show independence
we prove that for each (h, k) with 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1 and 0 ≤ k ≤ h there is no (h0, k0) with
≤ h0 ≤ p − 1 and 0 ≤ k0 ≤ h0 such that

(5)

equivalently,

(6)

(cid:26) n(p − 1 − h) + i = n(p − 1 − h0) + i0

nk + j = nk0 + j0

,

(cid:26) −nh + i = −nh0 + i0

nk + j = nk0 + j0.

If j = j0, then h 6= h0 by i 6= i0. We may assume h > h0. Then i − i0 = n(h − h0) > n, a
contradiction as i − i0 ≤ n − 3. Similarly, k > k0 yields j − j0 > n, a contradiction.

For the rest of this Section, An := A(Fn) is the matrix representing the p-power of the

Cartier operator C on the Fermat curve Fn with respect to the the basis B.
Proposition 3.2. If n = sp + 1, s ≥ 1, then rank(Asp+1) = 1
Proof. For n = sp + 1, then i + j ≤ n − 3 and system (2) modulo p reads

4 s(s − 1)p(p + 1).

(7)

(cid:26) i ≡ h

j ≡ p − 1 − k.

For s = 1, Fp+1 is the Hermitian curve over Fp2. From Theorem 2.1, rank(Ap+1) = 0.
This result can also be obtained by direct computation. In fact, for n = p + 1, we have
i + j ≤ p − 2 and since 0 ≤ i, j, h, k ≤ p − 2, system (7) becomes

(8)

(cid:26) i = h

j = p − 1 − k.

From this, p − 1 + (h − k) ≤ p − 2, whence h − k ≤ 1, a contradiction since h ≥ k.
This shows that for each (i, j) there is no (h, k) such that the system (8) is satisﬁed. In
particular, rank(Ap+1) = 0.

Let n = 2p + 1. For i + j ≤ p − 2 the above argument still works. Therefore p − 1 ≤

i + j ≤ 2p − 2, and we need to ﬁnd the solutions (h, k) mod p of the system

(9)

(cid:26) i ≡ h

j ≡ p − 1 − k.

Take l, m ∈ Z+

0 so that i = lp + h and j = mp + p − 1 − k. Then

p − 1 ≤ (l + m + 1)p + (h − k − 1) ≤ 2p − 2.

As h − k − 1 ≥ −1,

(cid:26) l + m + 1 ≥ 0

l + m + 1 < 2

,

i=0 (i + 1) = 1

2 p(p + 1)

2 p(p + 1).

whence l + m = 0. Thus, l = m = 0 as l, m ≥ 0. As we have Pp−1

choices for (h, k), each yielding a diﬀerent pair (i, j), rank(A2p+1) = 1

For s ≥ 3, rank(Asp+1) equals rank(A(s−1)p+1) plus the number of (i, j) such that there

is (h, k) solution of the system mod p

(cid:26) i ≡ h

j ≡ p − 1 − k,

with (s − 1)p − 1 ≤ i + j ≤ sp − 2. Take l, m so that i = lp + h and j = mp + p − 1 − k.
Then

(s − 1)p − 1 ≤ (l + m + 1)p + (h − k − 1) ≤ sp − 2.

Hence,

(cid:26) l + m + 1 ≥ s − 1

l + m + 1 < s,

whence, l+m = s−2. Since there are exactly s−1 diﬀerent choices for (l, m) and 1
choices for (h, k), we have 1

2 (s − 1)p(p + 1) distinct pairs (i, j). Therefore,

2 p(p+1)

rank(Asp+1) = rank(A(s−1)p+1) + 1

2 (s − 1)p(p + 1).

Now our claim follows by induction on s.

Remark 3.3. By [13, Corollary 1], a Fermat curve Fn is superspecial if and only if
n | p + 1.

Theorem 3.4. If n = sp + 1, s ≥ 1, the a-number of the Fermat curve Fsp+1 is

a(Fsp+1) = 1

4 s(s + 1)p(p − 1).

Proof. By a direct computation, as a(Fsp+1) = g(Fsp+1) − rank(Asp+1). Therefore, the
assertion follows by Proposition 3.2.

(cid:3)

Remark 3.5. For s = pr, the Fermat curve Fn is the Hermitian curve with aﬃne equation
X pr+1+1 + Y pr+1+1 + 1 = 0 and its a-number is equal to 1
4 pr(pr + 1)p(p − 1) by Theorem
3.4. This agrees with Gross’ result; see [9, Proposition 14.10]. Since the Hermitian curve
is Fp2(r+1)-maximal, Cr+1 = 0 by Theorem 2.1. It should be noticed that the ranks of Cn
for n ≤ r were determined in [16].

Proposition 3.6. If n = sp − 1, s ≥ 1, then

rank(Asp−1) =

1
2 (p − 2)(p − 3),

2 (p − 2)(p − 3) + p(p − 2),

s = 1,

s ≥ 4.

4 p[(p + 1)s2 + (p − 11)s − 12(p − 2)],
Proof. For n = sp − 1, then i + j ≤ n − 3 and system (2) modulo p reads

(10)

(cid:26) i ≡ p − (h + 2)

j − k ≡ p − 1.

For n = p − 1, we have i + j ≤ p − 4 and system (10) mod p becomes

(cid:26) i ≡ p − (h + 2)

j ≡ k − 1.

From this, j = k − 1. Take l ∈ Z so that i = 2p + lp − 2 − h. Then l < 0 as i ≤ p − 4.
Since

i + j = k − 1 + (l + 2)p − 2 − h ≤ p − 4

can be written as

(l + 2)p − (h − k + 3) ≤ p − 4,

and 0 ≤ h − k ≤ p − 3, we have −(p + 2) ≤ −(h − k + 3) ≤ −3. Since

(l + 2)p − (p + 2) ≤ (l + 2)p − (h − k + 3) ≤ p − 4

holds whenever l < 0, for each (h, k) there is a unique admissible pair (i, j). Thus we have
rank(Ap−1) = g(Fp−1) = 1

2 (p − 2)(p − 3).

Let n = 2p − 1. For i + j ≤ p − 4 the above argument still works. Therefore p − 3 ≤

i + j ≤ 2p − 4 and again we need to ﬁnd the solutions mod p of the system

(cid:26) i ≡ 2p − 2 − h

j ≡ p − 1 + k − 1.

Take l, m so that i = 2p − 2 + lp − h and j = mp + p − 1 + k. Then

i = (l + 2)p − (h + 2) ≤ 2p − 4

THE a-NUMBERS OF FERMAT AND HURWITZ CURVES

yields l ≤ 1. Also, l ≥ −2 as j ≥ 0. Similarly, −2 ≤ m ≤ 0. Further, as 3 ≤ h−k+3 ≤ p+2,
from

p − 3 ≤ (l + m + 3)p − (h − k + 3) ≤ 2p − 4,

we get

1 ≤ (l + m + 3) ≤ 2.

If l + m = −2, then (l, m) = (−1, −1) and h = k with
Thus, l + m ∈ {−2, −1}.
1 ≤ h ≤ p − 2.
In
the former case, 1 ≤ h ≤ p − 2 and 0 ≤ k ≤ h − 1, in the latter 2 ≤ h ≤ p − 1
and 1 ≤ k ≤ h − 1. Since any admissible (h, k) yields a unique pair (i, j), we have
rank(A2p−1) = 1

If l + m = −1, then (l, m) ∈ {(−1, 0), (0, −1)} and h ≥ k + 1.

2 (p − 2)(p − 3) + p(p − 2).

Let n = 3p − 1. For 0 ≤ i + j ≤ 2p − 4, we may still argue as before. For 2p − 3 ≤

i + j ≤ 3p − 4 we need to consider the system mod p

(cid:26) i ≡ 2p − 2 − h

j ≡ p − 1 + k − 1.

This time, −1 ≤ l, m ≤ 1. From

2p − 3 ≤ (m + l + 3)p − (h − k + 3) ≤ 3p − 4, −3 ≤ −(h + k + 3) ≤ −(p + 2)

we get l + m ∈ {−1, 0}. If l + m = −1, then (l, m) ∈ {(−1, 0), (0, −1)} and h = k. If
l+m = 0, then (l, m) ∈ {(−1, 1), (0, 0), (1, −1)}. If (l, m) = (−1, 1), then k+1 ≤ h ≤ p−2.
If (l, m) = (0, 0) or (1, −1), then 1 ≤ h ≤ p − 1. Thus, rank(A3p−1) = rank(A2p−1) + 1
2 (p −
2)(p − 2) + (p − 1)(p + 1).

For s ≥ 4, rank(Asp−1) equals rank(A(s−1)p−1) plus the number of distinct pairs (i, j)

such that there is a solution (h, k) of the system mod p

(cid:26) i ≡ 2p − 2 − h

j ≡ p − 1 + k − 1

where (s − 1)p − 3 ≤ i + j ≤ sp − 4. Take l, m such that i = lp − 2 − h and j = mp + k − 2.
Then −1 ≤ l, m ≤ s − 2 and m + l ∈ {s − 4, s − 3}. The former condition yields h = k,
the latter h ≥ k + 1. In fact, if l + m = s − 4, then

(11)

− (m + 1)p + 1 ≤ h ≤ (2 + l)p − 2.

For l > −1 or m ≥ 0, (11) holds for any h, while for l = −1, h ≤ p − 2 and for m = −1,
h ≥ 1.

If m + l = s − 3, then

(12)

(cid:26) h ≤ (2 + l)p − 2

k ≤ −(m + 1)p + 1.

For l > 1, (12) holds for any h. Also, h ≤ p − 2 for l = −1. For m ≥ 0, (12) holds for
any k, while k ≥ 1 for m = −1. This means that rank(Asp−1) = rank(A(s−1)p−1) + 1
2 (p −
1)(p − 2) + (s − 3)p + 1
2 (p − 1)[(s − 1)p + 2]. Now, our claim follows by induction on s. (cid:3)

The following result is a corollary of Proposition 3.6.

Theorem 3.7. If n = sp − 1, s ≥ 1, the a-number of the Fermat curve Fsp−1 is

a(Fsp−1) = 1

4 s(s − 1)p(p − 1).

MARIA MONTANUCCI AND PIETRO SPEZIALI

Remark 3.8. By Theorem 3.7, the Fermat curve Fp−1 with p > 3 is ordinary. This is a
special case of [11, Theorem 6.102], stating that Fn is ordinary if and only if n | p − 1.

Remark 3.9. For special values of p and n, more a-numbers of Fermat curves can be
obtained by combining our results with [13, Theorems 3-4]. For instance, by Theorem 3.4,
the a-number of the Fermat curve F10 for p = 3 is 18. As a consequence of [13, Theorem
3], F10 has a-number 18 also when p = 17. The same result holds for p = 7 by [13,
Theorem 4].

4. The a-number of Hurwitz curves

Since the Hurwitz curve Hn is nonsingular,

{xiyj | i + j ≤ n − 2}.

is a basis for the space of canonical adjoints of Hn. From Theorem 2.2, a basis for the
space H 0(Hn, Ω1) of holomorphic diﬀerentials on Hn is

B′ = {(xiyj/(xn + nyn−1))dx | i + j ≤ n − 2}.

Theorem 4.1. The rank of the Cartier operator C on the Hurwitz curve Hn equals the
number of pairs (i, j) with i + j ≤ n − 2 such that the system of congruences mod p

(13)

(cid:26) nk − h + i ≡ 0

n(h − k) + k + j ≡ p − 1

has a solution (h, k) for 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1, 0 ≤ k ≤ h.

Proof. By Theorem 2.3, C((xiyj/Fy)dx) = (∇(F p−1xiyj))1/pdx/Fy. We argue as in the
proof of Theorem 3.1. This time, we apply the diﬀerential operator ∇ to

(cid:18)p − 1

h (cid:19)(cid:18)h

k(cid:19)xnk−h+p−1+iyn(h−k)+k+j.

for i + j ≤ n − 2. From the formula in Remark 2.4, ∇((xny + yn + 1)p−1xiyj) is non-zero
if and only if some (h, k) with 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1, 0 ≤ k ≤ h satisﬁes both the following
congruences mod p

(cid:26) nk − h + i ≡ 0

n(h − k) + k + j ≡ p − 1.

Take (i, j) 6= (i0, j0) in such a way that ∇((xny + yn + 1)p−1xiyj) 6= 0 and ∇((xny + yn +
1)p−1xi0yj0) 6= 0. We claim that they are independent over K. To this end, it is enough
to show that for each (h, k) there is no (h0, k0) such that

(cid:26) nk − h + i = nk0 − h0 + i0

n(h − k) + k + jn(h0 − k0) + k0 + j0.

If h = h0, then k 6= k0 and k > k0 may be assumed. Then n(k − k0) = i0 − i, with k − k0
a positive integer, a contradiction since i0 − i ≤ n − 2. If h 6= h0, then h > h0 may be
assumed, and h − h0 = n(k − k0) + (i − i0). If k = k0, then n|(j − j0) with j − j0 ≤ n − 2,

whence,

i − i0 = (h − h0) + n(k0 − k) ≤ n − 2.

Thus, k0 − k < 0. Further, h − h0 ≥ 2 as i − i0 ≤ (h − h0) − n. This yields j0 − j ≥ n + 1,
a contradiction.

sp) = 1

Proposition 4.2. If n = sp, s ≥ 1, then rank(A′

4 s(s − 1)p(p + 1).

Proof. If n = sp, then i + j ≤ sp − 2 and system (13) mod p reads

(15)

(cid:26) i − h ≡ 0

k + j ≡ p − 1.

In particular, for n = p, we have i + j ≤ p − 2 and system (15) becomes

(cid:26) i = h

j = p − 1 − k.

From this, h+p−1−k ≤ p−2, whence h ≤ k −1, a contradiction. As a consequence, there
is no pair (i, j) for which the above system admits a solution (h, k). Thus, rank(A′
p) = 0.
Let n = 2p. For i + j ≤ p − 2, the above argument still works. Therefore, p − 1 ≤ i + j ≤
2p − 2 and our goal is to determine for which (i, j) there is a solution (h, k) of the system
mod p

(cid:26) i − h ≡ 0

k + j ≡ p − 1.

Take l, m ∈ Z+

0 so that i = lp + h and j = mp + p − 1 − k. Then, since

p − 1 ≤ (l + m + 1)p + (h − k − 1) ≤ 2p − 2

and 0 ≤ h − k ≤ p − 1, 1 ≤ l + m + 1 < 2, whence l = m = 0. In this way, 1
suitable values for (i, j) are obtained, whence rank(A′

2p) = 1

2 p(p + 1).

2 p(p + 1)

Let n = 3p. For i + j ≤ 2p − 2, the above argument still works. Therefore, 2p − 1 ≤

i + j ≤ 3p − 2 and we need to count the pairs (i, j) for which the system mod p

(cid:26) i − h ≡ 0

k + j ≡ p − 1.

has a solution (h, k). Taking l, m as before and arguing as in the previous step, we get
l + m = 1, that is (l, m) ∈ {(1, 0), (0, 1)}. Thus, rank(A′
2 p(p + 1). For s ≥ 4,
rank(A′
(s−1)p) plus the number of pairs (i, j) with (s − 1)p − 1 ≤ i + j ≤
sp − 2 such that the system mod p

sp) equals rank(A′

3p) = 3

(cid:26) i − h ≡ 0

k + j ≡ p − 1

has a solution. With our usual conventions on l, m, a computation shows that such
pairs (i, j) are obtained for l + m = s − 2. Since we have exactly s − 1 choices for
(l, m) and 1
2 p(p − 1) for (h, k), each yielding a diﬀerent admissible pair (i, j), we have
rank(Asp) = rank(A(s−1)p) + 1
(cid:3)

2 (s − 1)p(p + 1). Our claim follows by induction on s.

As a corollary of Proposition 4.2, we get the following result.

Theorem 4.3. If n = sp for s ≥ 1, then the a-number of the Hurwitz curve Hsp equals

a(Hsp) = 1

4 s(s + 1)p(p − 1).

Remark 4.4. From Theorem 4.3, the Hurwitz curve Hp is superspecial. Actually, this is
also a consequence of the Fp6-isomorphism between Hp and Fp+1; see [11, Section 12.3].

Remark 4.5. By Theorems 3.4 and 4.3, the curves Fsp+1 and Hsp have the same a-
number. By a straightforward computation, they also have the same genus. However, in
general they are not isomorphic, as the following example shows. Let p = 3. On the one
hand, by [1, Theorem 3.1], the Hurwitz curve H12 is F318-maximal and hence its 3-rank is
equal to zero. On the other hand, a MAGMA computation shows that the Fermat curve
F13 has 3-rank equal to 21. Therefore, H12 and F13 are not isomorphic, although their
genera and a-numbers coincide.

Proposition 4.6. If n = sp + 1, s ≥ 1, then
sp+1) = 1

rank(A′

4 s(s + 1)p(p + 1).

Proof. For n = sp + 1, then i + j ≤ n − 2 and system (13) modulo p reads

(16)

(cid:26) k − h + i ≡ 0

h + j ≡ p − 1,

for 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1 and k = 0 ≤ k ≤ h. Let n = p + 1. Then we need to determine for
which (i, j) there is a solution (h, k) of the system

(cid:26) i = h − k

j = p − 1 − h

p+1) = g(Hp+1) = 1

with i + j ≤ p − 1. Since any (h, k) is a solution, then any pair (i, j) is admissible, whence
rank(A′
2 p(p + 1). Let n = 2p + 1. For i + j ≤ p − 1, the above argument
can be repeated. Therefore p ≤ i + j ≤ 2p − 1. As before, we are led to consider the
system mod p

(cid:26) i ≡ h − k

j ≡ p − 1 − h.

Take l, m in such a way that i = pl + h − k and j = pm − 1 − h. Then any pair (h, k)
with 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1 and 0 ≤ k ≤ h is a solution of the above system provided that
l + m = 1. In this way, p(p − 1) distinct pairs (i, j) are obtained. Thus, rank(A′
2p+1) =
2 p(p + 1) + p(p + 1) = 3
1
(s−1)p+1) plus the
number of pairs (i, j) such that the system of congruences mod p

2 p(p + 1). For s ≥ 3, rank(A′

sp+1) equals rank(A′

(cid:26) i ≡ h − k

j ≡ p − 1 − h

with (s − 1)p ≤ i + j ≤ sp − 1 has a solution (h, k). There are exactly 1
2 sp(p + 1) such
pairs, namely (i, j) = (pl + h − k, pm − 1 − h) such that l + m = s − 1, 0 ≤ h ≤ p − 1 and
0 ≤ k ≤ h. Hence, rank(A′
2 sp(p + 1), and our result follows by
induction on s.

Theorem 4.7. If n = sp + 1, for s ≥ 1, then the a-number of the Hurwitz curve Hsp+1
equals

a(Hsp+1) = 1

4 s(s − 1)p(p − 1).

5. The a-number of Fermat curves in characteristic 2

Fo p = 2, Theorem 3.4 (or equivalently, Theorem 3.7) provides the a-number of any
Fermat curve Fn; see Theorem 5.1 below. Here, we give a direct proof requiring less
computation.
Theorem 5.1. Let p = 2. Then a(Fn) = 1

8 (n2 − 1).

Proof. In this case, it is easier to compute a(Fn) directly. By Theorem 2.3, we need to
determine the pairs (i, j) for which
∂

(17)

∂x∂y(cid:16)(xn + yn + 1)xiyj(cid:17)

is equal to zero. By a direct computation, (17) reads

(18)

j(n + i)xn+i−1yj−1 + i(n + j)xi−1yn+j−1 + ijxi−1yj−1.

Since n is odd, (18) is zero if and only if i and j are both even. Since n − 3 is even, there
are exactly 1
2 (n − 1) even integers r such that 0 ≤ r ≤ n − 3. Also, for i even, there are
1
2 (n − 1 − i) choices for j. Therefore,

a(Fn) =

(n−1)/2

Xi′=0

i′ = 1

8 (n2 − 1).

Remark 5.2. For p = 2, [13, Corollary 2] states 1 ≤ rank(An) ≤ g(Fn) − 1. Theorem 5.1
gives a better bound

(cid:3)

3 ≤ rank(An) = g(Fn) − 1

8 (n2 − 1) < g(Fn) − 1.
