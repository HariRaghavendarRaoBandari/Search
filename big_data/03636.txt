We present a novel reconﬁgurable metal-oxide-semiconductor multi-gate transistor that can host
a quadruple quantum dot in silicon. The device consist of an industrial quadruple-gate silicon
nanowire ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor. Exploiting the corner eﬀect, we study the versatility of the structure
in the single quantum dot and the serial double quantum dot regimes and extract the relevant
capacitance parameters. We address the fabrication variability of the quadruple-gate approach
which, paired with improved silicon fabrication techniques, makes the corner state quantum dot
approach a promising candidate for a scalable quantum information architecture.

Semiconductor quantum bits relying on the charge or
spin degree of freedom of a single electron, bound to
a quantum dot (QD) or impurity atom, are considered
promising candidates for the base elements of solid state
quantum computing architectures [1]. Building a suc-
cessful quantum computer, however, requires a scalable
multi-qubit approach to implement the necessary algo-
rithms [2]. Electron spins bound to silicon QDs are seen
as promising candidates for this due to their long coher-
ence time, electrical tunability and ﬂexible coupling ge-
ometries [3–5]. A further advantage of using Si is the pos-
sibility to integrate with current complementary-metal-
oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology [5–8] and lever-
age its established industrial platform for large scale
circuits. Recently, the integration of Si quantum dots
and double quantum dots (DQD) into CMOS technol-
ogy has been taken a step further with reports of few-
electron QDs, DQDs, and donor-QD hybrids created
within industry-standard Si nanowire transistors [9–12].
Combined with a gate-based readout scheme that allevi-
ates the need for a separate charge sensor [10–14] these
approaches pave the way towards a large scale quantum
computing architecture based on current CMOS technol-
ogy.

In this Letter, we report on a reconﬁgurable QD and
DQD system in a quadruple-gate CMOS transistor. It
incorporates one, or a pair, of CMOS corner state quan-
tum dots [10, 11] in a variety of conﬁgurations. Each of
the four gates can host an independently tunable quan-
tum dot created in the square channel by electrostatic
enhancement and conﬁnement resulting from the top-
gate electrodes and accompanying silicon nitride spacers.
We characterise one exemplary single QD and demon-
strate that diﬀerent DQD conﬁgurations can be set at
will. Building on previous demonstrations [10–12], our

results provide a way to scale up CMOS quantum infor-
mation architectures and to create reconﬁgurable silicon
multi-dot arrangements.

The device presented here is a fully depleted silicon-on-
insulator (FDSOI) nanowire ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor with
four independently addressable top-gates. The poly-

silicon top-gates of length L = 40 nm are arranged
around the sides of a 82 nm × 82 nm square at 45◦
with respect to transport direction as shown in white
dashes in the scanning electron micrograph of a similar
device in Fig.1(a). Gate-to-gate distances are SG1−G2 =
SG2−G3 = 30 nm, and the channel width W is 87 nm.
Fig.1(a) shows the Si3N4 spacers deposited between the
gates and extending 40 nm towards source and drain in
green. The channel below remains undoped generating
the source, drain and inter-dot tunnel barriers. Fig.1(b)
shows a cross-section sketch of the device perpendicular
to the direction of transport, taken at the line indicated
by the cyan line in Fig.1(a). The device comprises an
Si back plane serving as global backgate, topped by a
150 nm SiO2 buried oxide. This is followed by the un-
doped, square Si (001) channel of thickness 12 nm, which
is achieved by etching down the SOI substrate prior to
gate stack deposition. Each top-gate wraps around two
faces of the intrinsic channel and is separated from the
other top-gates by the Si3N4 spacers and from the chan-
nel by 5 nm of SiO2 [15]. A quantum dot can be created
under each gate at the top-most corners of the channel
due to the so-called corner eﬀect [10, 11, 16]. Each QD
is controlled by its respective gate voltage Vg(x), while
a global backgate voltage Vbg may be applied through
the Si substrate. All measurements shown in this Let-
ter are in direct transport and unless otherwise stated
were taken at Vbg = 5 V, to enhance the dot-to-dot and
dot-to-lead couplings [17].

Corner state quantum dots in Si nanowire transis-
tors have been reported for diﬀerent single and double
gate topologies [9–11] and using both quantum dots and
dopants [12]. In our novel quadruple gate conﬁguration,
we ﬁrst of all conﬁrm the creation of a single QD under a
top-gate using gate G1 as an example. In order to allow
for a source-drain current, G4 is pulled high above thresh-
old to Vg4 = 1.4 V, while the gates on the opposite chan-
nel side remain well below threshold at Vg2 = Vg3 = 0 V.
The backgate voltage is set to 0 V. This provides a single
QD under gate G1, as can be seen from the stability map

of Fig.2. We extract a charging energy Ec,G1 (cid:39) 9 meV
and source and drain capacitances Cs,G1 (cid:39) 2 aF and
Cd,G1 (cid:39) 1 aF from the slope of the Coulomb diamonds
and the gate voltage period. Single QDs embedded in a
multi-gate structure like the one investigated here could
host single electron spin qubits, or be used as single-
electron transistors for charge detection of a nearby dot.

The ability to create multi-QD conﬁgurations is, as
mentioned above, an important ingredient in the pur-
suit of a scalable semiconductor QIP architecture. In the
following paragraphs we demonstrate that diﬀerent con-
ﬁguration of serial DQDs can be formed in the nanowire
transistor and extract the DQD coupling capacitances.
All following measurements were carried out at a small
source-drain voltage Vds = 2 mV. First of all, we con-
ﬁgure the device as a serial DQD on the G1-G4 axis, by
setting Vg2 = Vg3 = 0 V. Fig.3(a) shows the resulting DC
current Ids as a function of Vg1 and Vg4. In the stability
map, we observe a honeycomb pattern and at its vertices
we ﬁnd the so-called bias triangles, i.e. periodic regions
of enhanced current resulting from the alignment of both
QD energy levels within the bias window, indicative of
a serial DQD [18]. At low voltages on both G1 and G4
the stability map shows the checker box behaviour char-
acteristic for low inter-dot coupling, transitioning to the
aforementioned honeycomb arrangement for intermedi-
ate coupling strength. At elevated top-gate voltages the
inter-dot coupling increases, resulting in undulated diag-
onal lines of enhanced conductance indicating that the
QDs are strongly tunnel coupled [19]. The voltage spac-
ing of Coulomb oscillations in the low to intermediate
coupling regime is ∆Vg1 (cid:39) 11 mV and ∆Vg4 (cid:39) 14 mV
(see also Fig.4(a)). Both spacings are very regular across
the voltage range studied here, indicating stable QD po-
sition and size. Fig.3(b) presents the opposite conﬁgu-
ration to Fig.3(a), a serial DQD along G2-G3 with now
Vg1 = Vg4 = 0 V. Similarly to Fig.3(a) we obtain a
honeycomb diagram, albeit a more compressed one with
∆Vg2 (cid:39) 9 mV and ∆Vg3 (cid:39) 8 mV, indicating larger QDs.
Finally, Fig.3(c) shows the stability map for a diago-

tual capacitance linking the QDs under gates G1 and G4:
g1 /∆Vg1 (cid:39) 6 aF. The same analysis car-
Cm,1−4 = C4∆V m
ried out for the diagonal DQD along G1-G3 (not shown
here) yields a mutual capacitance Cm,1−3 (cid:39) 4 aF.

Variability between nominally identical devices from
diﬀerent batches but also within a single batch fabricated
at the same time is an important benchmarking param-
eter in CMOS technology. Comparing all four gate ca-
pacitances of the device presented here, we ﬁnd a mean
gate capacitance of about 16 aF and a variance of 25%.
We attribute this variance to variations in gate dielectric
thickness and quality, as well as gate misalignment rel-
ative to the channel. All three factors directly inﬂuence
the enhancement mode corner state QDs.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a reconﬁgurable
quantum dot and double quantum dot system based on
a quadruple-gate CMOS transistor. Taking into account
the continuous
improvement of CMOS fabrication
techniques and the single electron control demonstrated
here, corner state quantum dots present a valid and
scalable option as base elements of a silicon quantum
information architecture. Moreover,
this approach
can readily be extended to a larger number of gates
providing a 1-D line of QDs and DQDs,while remaining
compact by further integrating high-sensitivity gate-
based reﬂectometry readout [10, 11]. The versatility
of the corner state QD structure allows to use the
gate-based sensing either for in-situ readout, but also for
conventional charge sensing using an rf-single electron
box for detection. Further experiments that can be
envisioned with this architecture are e.g.
electron
charge and electron spin buses, measurements of long
distance coherent coupling [20], and single spin CCD [21].

nal DQD using G1 and G3 as constituent quantum dots.
Here, the overall current is reduced compared to the pre-
vious two conﬁgurations, which we attribute to the larger
distance between the dots under G2 and G3 and hence
reduced iter-dot tunnel rates. We extract Coulomb spac-
ings ∆Vg1 (cid:39) 13 mV and ∆Vg3 (cid:39) 7 mV, approximately in
line with the previous results. Similar results have been
obtained for the DQD along the G2-G4 axis (not shown
here).

Last but not least, we study the serial DQD along
G1-G4 in more detail to obtain estimates of the capaci-
tances involved in the system. From the honeycomb di-
agram outlined in Fig.4(a) we extract voltage spacings
∆VG1 (cid:39) 11 mV and ∆VG4 (cid:39) 14 mV between Coulomb
oscillations. These spacings are linked to the gate ca-
pacitances of the two serial QDs as ∆VGi = e/CGi
[18] and we thus estimate CG1 (cid:39) 15 aF and CG4 (cid:39)
12 aF. Applying this analysis to the G2-G3 conﬁgu-
ration, we ﬁnd gate capacitances CG2 (cid:39) 12 aF and
CG3 (cid:39) 20 aF. The voltage spacings δVG1 and δVG4 ex-
tracted from Fig.4(b) in combination with the source-
drain voltage Vsd = 2 mV provide us with an estimate
for the lever arms α1(4) and total capacitances C1(4) as
α1(4)δVG1(4) = e|Vsd| = eδVG1(4)CG1(4)/C1(4) [18]. We
ﬁnd lever arms α1(4) (cid:39) 0.55 (0.49) and total capacitances
C1(4) (cid:39) 26 (23) aF. These values in addition to ∆V m
g1(4)
from Fig.4(a) allow us now to also approximate the mu-
