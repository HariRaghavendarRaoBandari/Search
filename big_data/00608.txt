DISTRIBUTIVE AND TRIMEDIAL QUASIGROUPS OF ORDER 243

P ˇREMYSL JEDLI ˇCKA, DAVID STANOVSK ´Y, AND PETR VOJTˇECHOVSK ´Y

Abstract. We enumerate three classes of non-medial quasigroups of order 243 = 35 up
to isomorphism. There are 17004 non-medial trimedial quasigroups of order 243 (extending
the work of Kepka, B´en´eteau and Lacaze), 92 non-medial distributive quasigroups of order
243 (extending the work of Kepka and Nˇemec), and 6 non-medial distributive Mendelsohn
quasigroups of order 243 (extending the work of Donovan, Griggs, McCourt, Oprˇsal and
Stanovsk´y).

The enumeration technique is based on aﬃne representations over commutative Moufang
loops, on properties of automorphism groups of commutative Moufang loops, and on com-
puter calculations with the LOOPS package in GAP.

1. Introduction

Enumeration of quasigroups (equivalently, latin squares) is one of the classical topics of
combinatorics. Enumerating all quasigroups of a given order n is a diﬃcult problem already
for small values of n. Indeed, the number of latin squares is known only up to n = 11 [18], and
the number of quasigroups up to isomorphism is known only up to n = 10 [17]. Consequently,
many quasigroup enumeration projects deal with particular well-studied classes or varieties.
In this paper we focus on quasigroups that admit an aﬃne representation over nonasso-
ciative commutative Moufang loops. In particular, we enumerate the non-medial trimedial
quasigroups of order 243 up to isomorphism, and also determine the number of those which
are distributive, and distributive Medelsohn, respectively; the latter number equals the num-
ber of non-aﬃne distributive Mendelsohn triple systems of order 243.

The enumeration of quasigroups aﬃne over nonassociative commative Moufang loops is
interesting only for orders that are powers of 3 (see below). The previous step, n = 81 = 34,
has been completed in 1981 by Kepka and Nˇemec for distributive quasigroups [16], and
in 1987 by Kepka, B´en´eteau and Lacaze for trimedial quasigroups [15]. Our calculations
independently verify their enumeration results.

A quasigroup is a set Q with a binary operation + such that all left translations Lx : Q →
Q, y 7→ x + y and all right translations Rx : Q → Q, y 7→ y + x are bijections of Q. A
quasigroup (Q, +) is a loop if it possesses a neutral element, that is, an element 0 satisfying
0 + x = x + 0 = x for all x ∈ Q.

A quasigroup (Q, +) is called idempotent if it satisﬁes the identity

x + x = x,

medial (also entropic or abelian) if it satisﬁes the identity

(x + y) + (u + v) = (x + u) + (y + v),

and distributive if it satisﬁes the two identities

x + (y + z) = (x + y) + (x + z),

(x + y) + z = (x + z) + (y + z).

A quasigroup (Q, +) is trimedial (also terentropic or triabelian) if every three elements of
Q generate a medial subquasigroup. Belousov established the following connection between
these types of quasigroups:

Theorem 1.1 ([1]). A quasigroup is distributive if and only if it is trimedial and idempotent.

Historically, distributive and medial quasigroups were one of the ﬁrst nonassociative alge-
braic structures studied [8]. Their structure theory has been developed mostly in the 1960s
and 1970s: see [3] or [25, Section 3] for an overview. Quasigroups satisfying various forms of
self-distributivity were one of the favorite topics of Belousov’s school of quasigroup theory
[2], and they have connections to other branches of mathematics as well [25, Section 1].

The classiﬁcation of medial quasigroups is to a large extent a matter of understanding
conjugation in the automorphism groups of abelian groups. This is explained in detail in
[26], for instance, where one can also ﬁnd the complete classiﬁcation of medial quasigroups
up to order 63 (up to order 127 with a few gaps). Hou [12] has stronger results on the
enumeration of idempotent medial quasigroups.

In the present paper, we will focus on non-medial trimedial quasigroups, which will require

computational tools that are rather diﬀerent from those of the medial case.

One of the fundamental tools in quasigroup theory is loop isotopy. In particular, aﬃne rep-
resentations of quasigroups over various classes of loops are tremendously useful in the study
of quasigroups. The Kepka theorem [14] (see Theorem 2.9) represents trimedial quasigroups
over commutative Moufang loops.
It is a generalization of both the Toyoda-Bruck theo-
rem [5, 20, 27] (see Theorem 2.10) that represents medial quasigroups over abelian groups,
and the Belousov-Soublin theorem [1, 24] (see Theorem 2.11) that represents distributive
quasigroups over commutative Moufang loops. Theorem 2.13, proved in [15], solves the iso-
morphism problem for representations of trimedial quasigroups and forms the basis for our
enumeration algorithm.

The class of commutative Moufang loops has attracted attention from the very onset of
abstract loop theory. A signiﬁcant part of the fundamental text of loop theory, Bruck’s “A
survey of binary systems” [7], has been written to develop tools for dealing with commutative
Moufang loops.

Every ﬁnite commutative Moufang loop decomposes as a direct product of an abelian group
of order coprime to 3 and of a commutative Moufang loop of order a power of 3 [6, Theorem
7C]. It was known to Bruck that there are no nonassociative commutative Moufang loops of
order less than 34. Kepka and Nˇemec [16] classiﬁed nonassociative commutative Moufang
loops of orders 34 and 35 up to isomorphism: there are two of order 34 and six of order 35.
See [16] for explicit constructions of these commutative Moufang loops, and [4, Theorem
IV.3.44] for more results on commutative Moufang loops with a prescribed nilpotence class.

Every automorphism of a commutative Moufang loop decomposes as a direct product of
automorphisms of the two coprime components. Therefore, thanks to Kepka’s Theorem,
every ﬁnite trimedial quasigroup is a direct product of a medial quasigroup of order coprime
to 3 and of a non-medial trimedial quasigroup of order a power of 3, and there are no
non-medial trimedial quasigroups of order less than 34.

The classiﬁcation of non-medial distributive quasigroups of order 34 was also carried out
in [16]; there are 6 such quasigroups up to isomorphism. Non-medial trimedial quasigroups
of order 34 were enumerated by Kepka, B´en´etau and Lacaze in [15]; there are 35 of them
up to isomorphism. Both [16] and [15] use aﬃne representations and a careful analysis of
the automorphism groups of the two nonassociative commutative Moufang loops of order 34,
without using computers.

The main result of this paper is a computer enumeration of non-medial distributive quasi-
groups and non-medial trimedial quasigroups of order 35 up to isomorphism; see Table 3.
The paper is organized as follows.

In Section 2 we summarize theoretical results that we use in the enumeration. After
introducing the notions of 1-central automorphisms and orthomorphisms, we state the rep-
resentation theorems 2.9–2.11 and the isomorphism theorem 2.13. We ﬁnish the section with
notes on general aﬃne representations and on Steiner and Mendelsohn quasigroups. Most
of the contents of Section 2 are present, implicitly or explicitly, in [9, 15, 16].

In Section 3 we describe in detail our main contribution, the classiﬁcation algorithm (The-

orem 3.3).

In Section 4 we present the results of our calculations, see Tables 2 and 3. We also give a
sample of explicit constructions of non-medial distributive quasigroups of order 35, including
all from which one can recover the non-aﬃne distributive Mendelsohn triple systems of
order 35. In the end, we discuss the phenomenon that for many small commutative Moufang
loops, all 1-central automorphisms commute.

Basic deﬁnitions and results. Loops will be denoted additively, assuming implicitly Q =
(Q, +, 0). The center Z(Q) of a loop Q is the set of all elements of Q that commute and
associate with all elements of Q. The associator subloop A(Q) of a loop Q is the smallest
normal subloop of Q generated by all associators L−1
x+(y+z)((x + y) + z). The automorphism
group of Q will be denoted by Aut(Q).

A loop Q is power associative if any element of Q generates an associative subloop. Every
element x of a power associative loop Q has a two-sided inverse −x satisfying (−x) + x =
0 = x + (−x). We write x − y as a shorthand for x + (−y).

A loop Q is diassociative if any two elements of Q generate an associative subloop. Com-

mutative diassociative loops satisfy the automorphic inverse property −(x + y) = −x − y.

A loop Q is Moufang it it satisﬁes the identity x + (y + (x + z)) = ((x + y) + x) + z. By
Moufang’s theorem [19], Moufang loops are diassociative. In a commutative Moufang loop
Q, we have x + x + x = 3x ∈ Z(Q) for every x ∈ Q [6]. See [2, 4, 6, 7] for more results on
commutative Moufang loops.

2. Affine representation of trimedial quasigroups

2.1. 1-central automorphisms and orthomorphisms. Let Q be a loop and α : Q → Q
a mapping. Throughout the paper, denote by ˆα the mapping id + α, i.e.,

ˆα : Q → Q,

x 7→ x + α(x).

As in [16, p. 636], we say that α is 1-central if ˆα(x) ∈ Z(Q) for every x ∈ Q.

Note that when Q is a loop with two-sided inverses and α : Q → Q is 1-central, then

ˆα(x) = x + α(x) implies

an identity we will use freely.

For a loop Q, let

α(x) = −x + ˆα(x),

AutC(Q) = {α ∈ Aut(Q) : α is 1-central}

be the set of all 1-central automorphisms of Q. Note that AutC(Q) need not be a subgroup
of Aut(Q). When Q is an abelian group then AutC(Q) = Aut(Q), of course.

Lemma 2.1. Let Q be a loop with the automorphic inverse property and let α : Q → Q be
a mapping. Then α is a 1-central endomorphism if and only if ˆα is an endomorphism into
Z(Q). Moreover,

Ker(α) = {x ∈ Q : α(x) = 0} = {x ∈ Q : ˆα(x) = x} = Fix( ˆα).

Proof. Suppose that α is a 1-central endomorphism. Then ˆα(x + y) = (x + y) + α(x + y) =
(x + y) + (α(x) + α(y)) = (x + y) + ((−x + ˆα(x)) + (−y + ˆα(y)) = ((x + y) + (−x − y)) +
( ˆα(x) + ˆα(y)) = ((x + y) − (x + y)) + ( ˆα(x) + ˆα(y)) = ˆα(x) + ˆα(y), where we have used the
automorphic inverse property.

Conversely, suppose that ˆα is an endomorphism into Z(Q). Then α(x + y) = −(x + y) +
ˆα(x + y) = (−x − y) + ( ˆα(x) + ˆα(y)) = (−x + ˆα(x)) + (−y + ˆα(y)) = α(x) + α(y), where we
have again used the automorphic inverse property.

Note that α(x) = 0 if and only if ˆα(x) = x. The rest is clear.

(cid:3)

In particular, if Q is a ﬁnite loop with the automorphic inverse property and α : Q → Q is
a mapping, then α ∈ AutC(Q) if and only if ˆα is an endomorphism into Z(Q) with a unique
ﬁxed point.

As in [13], we say that a permutation α of a loop Q with two-sided inverses is a (left)

orthomorphism if the mapping id − α is also a permutation of Q.

Remark 2.2. Strictly speaking, orthomorphisms were deﬁned only for ﬁnite groups in [13].
Nowadays, researchers routinely work with orthomorphisms in arbitrary groups, but usually
use the dual notion of a right orthomorphism (−id + α is a permutation). In loops with the
automorphic inverse property, id−α is a permutation if and only if −id+α is a permutation.

An orthomorphism need not be an automorphism. For brevity, we call orthomorphisms

that are also automorphisms orthoautomorphisms.

For a loop Q with two-sided inverses, let

AutCO(Q) = {α ∈ AutC(Q) : α is an orthomorphism}

be the set of all 1-central orthoautomorphisms of Q.

Lemma 2.3. Let Q be a commutative Moufang loop and let α : Q → Q be a mapping. Then
α ∈ AutCO(Q) if and only if id − α ∈ AutCO(Q).

Proof. In any diassociative loop we have id − (id − α) = α because x − (x − α(x)) = α(x).
It therefore suﬃces to show that if α ∈ AutCO(Q) then β = id − α ∈ AutCO(Q). Suppose
that α ∈ AutCO(Q). By Lemma 2.1, ˆα is an endomorphism into Z(Q).

For every x ∈ Q we have β(x) = x − α(x) = x − (−x + ˆα(x)) = 2x − ˆα(x). Hence
β(x) + β(y) = (2x − ˆα(x)) + (2y − ˆα(y)) = (2x + 2y) − ( ˆα(x) + ˆα(y)) = 2(x + y) − ˆα(x + y) =
β(x + y), proving that β ∈ Aut(Q). We also have ˆβ(x) = x + β(x) = 3x − ˆα(x) ∈ Z(Q)
because 3x ∈ Z(Q), so β is 1-central. Finally, id − β = id − (id − α) = α shows that β is an
orthomorphism.
(cid:3)

Lemma 2.4. Let Q be a loop with two-sided inverses. Then the subsets AutC(Q) and
AutCO(Q) of Aut(Q) are closed under conjugation by elements of Aut(Q).

Proof. Let α ∈ AutC(Q) and ξ ∈ Aut(Q). Certainly, αξ ∈ Aut(Q). For every x ∈ Q we
have cαξ(x) = (id + αξ)(x) = (id + α)ξ(x) = ˆαξ(x) = ξ−1 ˆαξ(x) ∈ Z(Q) since α is 1-central.
Therefore αξ is 1-central.

If α is also an orthomorphism then id − α is a permutation of Q, hence id − αξ = (id − α)ξ
(cid:3)

is a permutation of Q, and αξ is an orthomorphism.

2.2. Aﬃne representations and isomorphism theorems. For the purposes of this pa-
per, we deﬁne quasigroups aﬃne over loops as follows:

Deﬁnition 2.5. Let (Q, +) be a loop, let ϕ, ψ be automorphisms of (Q, +), and let c ∈
Z(Q, +). Deﬁne a binary operation ∗ on Q by

(2.1)

x ∗ y = ϕ(x) + ψ(y) + c.

The resulting quasigroup (Q, ∗) is said to be aﬃne over the loop (Q, +), it will be denoted by
Q(Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c), and the quintuple (Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c) will be called an arithmetic form of (Q, ∗).

Remark 2.6. Deﬁnition 2.5 can be further generalized by not assuming that c is a central
element or, even more generally, that x ∗ y = (ϕ(x) + c) + (ψ(y) + d) for automorphisms ϕ,
ψ and arbitrary elements c, d. On the other hand, it can be specialized by assuming that
c = 0 (linear case), that ϕψ = ψϕ, or that ϕ, ψ are 1-central, for instance. See [25, Section
2.3] for a detailed discussion.

Lemma 2.7. An aﬃne quasigroup (Q, ∗) = Q(Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c) is idempotent if and only if
c = 0 and ϕ + ψ = id.

Proof. If (Q, ∗) is idempotent then x = x ∗ x = ϕ(x) + ψ(x) + c for every x ∈ Q. With x = 0
we deduce c = 0. Then ϕ(x) + ψ(x) = x for every x ∈ Q, so ϕ + ψ = id.
Conversely, if ϕ + ψ = id and c = 0 then x ∗ x = ϕ(x) + ψ(x) + c = x.

(cid:3)

Lemma 2.8. Let (Q, ∗) = Q(Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c) be an aﬃne quasigroup. Then (Q, ∗) is medial if
and only if (Q, +) is an abelian group and ϕψ = ψϕ.

Proof. Note that

(x ∗ u) ∗ (v ∗ y) = (ϕϕ(x) + ϕψ(u) + ϕ(c)) + (ψϕ(v) + ψψ(y) + ψ(c)) + c.

5

Since ϕ(c), ψ(c), c are central, we see that (Q, ∗) is medial if and only if

(2.2)

(ϕϕ(x) + ϕψ(u)) + (ψϕ(v) + ψψ(y)) = (ϕϕ(x) + ϕψ(v)) + (ψϕ(u) + ψψ(y)).

If (Q, +) is an abelian group and ϕψ = ψϕ then (2.2) holds.

Conversely, suppose that (2.2) holds. With x = y = v = 0 we deduce ϕψ = ψϕ from (2.2).
Then with x = y = 0 we deduce ϕψ(u) + ϕψ(v) = ϕψ(v) + ϕψ(u), so (Q, +) is commutative.
Finally, with x = 0 we deduce the identity r + (s + t) = s + (r + t), which, combined with
commutativity, yields associativity of (Q, +).
(cid:3)

Theorem 2.9 (Kepka theorem [14]). A quasigroup is trimedial if and only if it admits
an arithmetic form (Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c), where (Q, +) is a commutative Moufang loop, ϕ, ψ are
1-central automorphisms, and ϕψ = ψϕ.

Lemmas 2.7, 2.8 and Theorem 1.1 show that the Kepka theorem generalizes both the
Toyoda-Bruck theorem (set (Q, +) to be an abelian group) and the Belousov-Soublin theorem
(set c = 0 and ϕ + ψ = id).

Theorem 2.10 (Toyoda-Bruck theorem [5, 20, 27]). A quasigroup is medial if and only if it
admits an arithmetic form (Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c), where (Q, +) is an abelian group and ϕψ = ψϕ.

Theorem 2.11 (Belousov-Soublin theorem [1, 24]). A quasigroup is distributive if and only
if it admits an arithmetic form (Q, +, ϕ, ψ, 0), where (Q, +) is a commutative Moufang loop,
ϕ, ψ are 1-central automorphisms, and ϕ = id − ψ.

Note that in the Belousov-Soublin theorem the condition ϕ = id − ψ implies that ψ is an

orthomorphism. Then we have ϕψ = (id − ψ)ψ = ψ − ψ2 = ψ(id − ψ) = ψϕ for free.

Here is a variation of the Belousov-Soublin theorem which will be used in Section 4:

Corollary 2.12. A quasigroup (Q, ∗) is distributive if and only if there is a commutative
Moufang loop (Q, +) and a 1-central orthoautomorphism ψ of (Q, +) such that

x ∗ y = (2x − y) + ˆψ(y − x).

Proof. By Lemma 2.3, if (Q, +) is a commutative Moufang loop and ψ ∈ AutCO(Q, +) then
id − ψ ∈ AutCO(Q, +) ⊆ AutC(Q, +). It therefore suﬃces to show that (x − ψ(x)) + ψ(y) =
(2x − y) + ˆψ(y − x). By Lemma 2.1, ˆψ is an endomorphism into Z(Q, +). Therefore,
(x−ψ(x))+ψ(y) = (2x− ˆψ(x))+(−y+ ˆψ(y)) = (2x−y)+ ˆψ(y)− ˆψ(x) = (2x−y)+ ˆψ(y−x). (cid:3)

Let us now state a solution to the isomorphism problem for certain aﬃne representations

that cover the representations in Theorems 2.9, 2.10, 2.11.

Theorem 2.13 ([15]). For i = 1, 2, let (Qi, +i) be a commutative Moufang loop, ϕi, ψi
1-central automorphisms of (Qi, +i), and ci ∈ Z(Qi, +i). Then the two aﬃne quasigroups
Q(Q1, +1, ϕ1, ψ1, c1), Q(Q2, +2, ϕ2, ψ2, c2) are isomorphic if and only if there is a loop iso-
morphism f : (Q1, +1) → (Q2, +2) and u ∈ Im(id −1 (ϕ1 +1 ψ1)) such that

ϕ2 = f ϕ1f −1, ψ2 = f ψ1f −1 and c2 = f (c1 +1 u).

Remark 2.14. The original formulation of the isomorphism test in Theorem 2.13 is some-
what diﬀerent in [15]. Namely, the condition is replaced with: There is a loop isomorphism
f : (Q1, +1) → (Q2, +2) and w ∈ Q2 such that

ϕ2f = f ϕ1, ψ2f = f ψ1,

f (c1) −2 c2 = w −2 (ϕ2(w) +2 ψ2(w)).

6

We claim that this condition is equivalent to the condition of Theorem 2.13. First, because
“to be isomorphic” is a symmetric relation, we can replace the above condition with: There
is a loop isomorphism f : (Q2, +2) → (Q1, +1) and w ∈ Q1 such that

ϕ1f = f ϕ2, ψ1f = f ψ2,

f (c2) −1 c1 = w −1 (ϕ1(w) +1 ψ1(w)).

Upon considering f −1, we can further replace it with the statement: There is a loop isomor-
phism f : (Q1, +1) → (Q2, +2) and w ∈ Q1 such that

ϕ1f −1 = f −1ϕ2, ψ1f −1 = f −1ψ2,

f −1(c2) −1 c1 = w −1 (ϕ1(w) +1 ψ1(w)).

The condition on c2 is then equivalent to c2 = f (c1 +1 w −1 (ϕ1(w) + ψ1(w))), which says
that c2 = f (c1 +1 u) for some u ∈ Im(id −1 (ϕ1 +1 ψ1)).

Note that in the distributive case (c = 0 and ϕ + ψ = id), the isomorphism test of
Theorem 2.13 reduces to: There is a loop isomorphism f : (Q1, +1) → (Q2, +2) such that
ψ2 = f ψ1f −1.

2.3. Quasigroups corresponding to triple systems. Certain distributive quasigroups
correspond to interesting combinatorial designs, such as Hall triple systems (these are the
distributive Steiner quasigroups), or distributive Mendelsohn triple systems (the distributive
Mendelsohn quasigroups); see [9] for details. The classiﬁcation of the respective quasigroups
directly translates into the classiﬁcation of the corresponding triple systems.

Non-medial distributive Mendelsohn quasigroups were enumerated up to order 34 in [9],
and non-medial distributive Steiner quasigroups were enumerated up to order 36 in [3]. In
the present paper, we extend the classiﬁcation in the Mendelsohn case to order 35. The
following simple criterion identiﬁes the relevant quasigroups in our classiﬁcation results.

Proposition 2.15 ([9, Proposition 2.1]). Let (Q, +) be a commutative Moufang loop and let
ψ ∈ AutCO(Q, +). The corresponding distributive quasigroup Q(Q, +, id − ψ, ψ, 0) is:
(i) Steiner if and only if (Q, +) has exponent 3 and ψ(x) = −x for every x ∈ Q;
(ii) Mendelsohn if and only if ψ2(x) − ψ(x) + x = 0 for every x ∈ Q.

Remark 2.16. In a commutative Moufang loop we have (x + y) + z = 0 if and only if
x + (y + z) = 0, so it is not necessary to specify the order of addition in the expression
ψ2(x) − ψ(x) + x above.

Corollary 2.17. Let (Q, +) be a commutative Moufang loop and let ψ ∈ AutCO(Q, +). The
corresponding distributive quasigroup Q(Q, +, id − ψ, ψ, 0) is:

(i) Steiner if and only if (Q, +) has exponent 3 and ˆψ = 0;
(ii) Mendelsohn if and only if ˆψ2(x) − 3 ˆψ(x) + 3x = 0 for every x ∈ Q.

Proof. Part (i) is obvious. For (ii), we calculate ψ2 − ψ + id = (−id + ˆψ)2 − (−id + ˆψ) + id =
ˆψ2 − 3 ˆψ + 3id.
(cid:3)

In particular, if a commutative Moufang loop (Q, +) has exponent 3 then the corresponding
distributive quasigroup is Steiner if and only if ˆψ = 0, and it is Mendelsohn if and only if
ˆψ2 = 0.

3. The classification algorithm

3.1. Outline of the algorithm. For the purposes of this classiﬁcation, let us call an aﬃne
quasigroup Q(Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c) of Deﬁnition 2.5 1-central
if the automorphisms ϕ, ψ are 1-
central. (In particular, quasigroups that are 1-central over abelian groups are precisely the
central quasigroups [26].)

Theorem 2.13 suggests the following algorithm for the classiﬁcation of 1-central quasi-

groups Q(Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c) over commutative Moufang loops.

Let Q = (Q, +). We calculate the set AutC(Q) × AutC(Q) × Z(Q) and ﬁlter it subject to
the equivalence induced by the condition in Theorem 2.13. To obtain trimedial quasigroups,
we consider only triples (ϕ, ψ, c) satisfying ϕψ = ψϕ. To obtain distributive quasigroups, we
consider only triples (ϕ, ψ, c) satisfying c = 0 and ϕ + ψ = id.

To complete the classiﬁcation for a ﬁxed order n, it suﬃces to consider the disjoint union
of the classiﬁcations obtained for each of the commutative Moufang loops of order n because
isomorphic 1-central quasigroups have isomorphic underlying loops, cf. Theorem 2.13. To
obtain non-medial quasigroups, we consider only nonassociative loops, cf. Lemma 2.8.

Essentially the same idea was used in [15, 16] to classify trimedial and distributive quasi-
groups of order 34 = 81 by hand. Manual classiﬁcation is out of the question for order
35, and even straightforward computer calculation is insuﬃcient since the size of the set
AutC(Q) × AutC(Q) × Z(Q) is of the magnitude 108 for some of the loops under considera-
tion.

In the rest of this section we describe how to speed up the algorithm. We start with

general ideas that can be used for any order.

3.2. Calculating 1-central automorphisms. We do not calculate the set AutC(Q) di-
rectly by ﬁltering Aut(Q) because Aut(Q) can be too large. Instead, we use an incremental
approach. Let

H(Q) = {α ∈ Aut(Q) : α(x) + x ∈ Z(Q) or α(x) − x ∈ Z(Q) for every x ∈ Q}.

We clearly have AutC(Q) ⊆ H(Q) and it is not hard to check that H(Q) is a subgroup of
Aut(Q) (unlike AutC(Q)).

The standard algorithm for calculating automorphisms of a given algebraic structure at-
tempts to extend a partial map deﬁned on a ﬁxed generating set into an automorphism,
while employing various isomorphism invariants to restrict possible images of the genera-
tors. Modifying this algorithm, we can calculate a (small) subgroup of Aut(Q) containing
H(Q) as follows. Let X be a set of generators of Q used in the search. Whenever a choice
is being made for the image of x ∈ X, restrict the choice to the cosets ±x + Z(Q). Since we
enforce this condition only for generators, the algorithm can yield a subgroup G of Aut(Q)
properly containing H(Q). We can then ﬁlter the elements of G to obtain H(Q) and, in
turn, AutC(Q) and AutCO(Q).

To ﬁnish the classiﬁcation of distributive quasigroups, various subgroups U of Aut(Q) can
be used to ﬁlter AutCO(Q) up to conjugacy in U (which makes sense thanks to Lemma
2.4). This is not necessarily as powerful as the conjugacy in the entire group Aut(Q), but it
reduces the number of elements of AutCO(Q) to be considered in the ﬁnal stage, where we
employ the entire Aut(Q) to ﬁnish the classiﬁcation. In our implementation, we used for U
the pointwise stabilizer of Z(Q) in Aut(Q).

3.3. Handling the action on AutC(Q) × AutC(Q) × Z(Q). For trimedial quasigroups, we
must ﬁnd a way to handle the equivalence on AutC(Q) × AutC(Q) and the relation between
c1 and c2 in the isomorphism test of Theorem 2.13.

Consider any group G and a subset X ⊆ A closed under conjugation in A. (Later we
will take G = Aut(Q) and X = AutC(Q), cf. Lemma 2.4.) Then G acts on X × X by
simultaneous conjugation in both coordinates, i.e., (α, β)γ = (αγ, βγ). To calculate orbits on
X × X, we take advantage of the following well-known result.

Lemma 3.1. Let G be a group acting on a set X. Let O be a set of orbit representatives of
the action, and for every x ∈ O let Ox be a set of orbit representatives of the action of the
stabilizer Gx on X. Then

{(a, b) : a ∈ O, b ∈ Oa}

is a complete set of orbit representatives of the action of G on X × X given by (x, y)g =
(xg, yg).

Proof. For every (x, y) ∈ X × X there is a unique a ∈ O and some z ∈ X such that (x, y)
and (a, z) are in the same orbit. For a ﬁxed a ∈ O and some u, v ∈ X, we have (a, u) in the
same orbit as (a, v) if and only if u, v belong to the same orbit of Ga.
(cid:3)

Lemma 3.2. Let Q = (Q, +) be a commutative Moufang loop, let A = Aut(Q), and let
α, β ∈ AutC(Q). Then CA(α) ∩ CA(β) acts naturally on Z(Q)/Im(id − (α + β)).

Proof. Let I = Im(id − (α + β)). First, we note that I ≤ Z(Q). Indeed, for every x ∈ Q, we
have

x − (α(x) + β(x)) = x − ((−x + ˆα(x)) + (−x + ˆβ(x))) = 3x − ( ˆα(x) + ˆβ(x)) ∈ Z(Q),

because 3x ∈ Z(Q) and α, β are 1-central.

It remains to show that for every γ ∈ CA(α) ∩ CA(β) the mapping u + I 7→ γ(u) + I is well-
deﬁned. Suppose that u + I = v + I for some u, v ∈ Z(Q). Then u = v + (x − (α(x) + β(x)))
for some x ∈ Q, and we have

γ(u) = γ(v) + (γ(x) − (γα(x) + γβ(x)))

= γ(v) + (γ(x) − (αγ(x) + βγ(x)))

= γ(v) + (id − (α + β))(γ(x)) ∈ γ(v) + I,

ﬁnishing the proof.

(cid:3)

We can now reformulate Theorem 2.13 so that it can be used directly in the enumeration of
quasigroups that are 1-central over a given commutative Moufang loop. (A similar theorem
for abelian groups was obtained by Dr´apal [10, Theorem 3.2] and used as an enumeration
tool in [26].)

Theorem 3.3. Let Q = (Q, +) be a commutative Moufang loop and let A = Aut(Q). The
isomorphism classes of 1-central quasigroups over Q (resp. trimedial quasigroups over Q)
are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the set

{(ϕ, ψ, c) : ϕ ∈ X, ψ ∈ Yϕ, c ∈ Zϕ,ψ},

where

• X is a complete set of orbit representatives of the conjugation action of A on AutC(Q);

9

• Yϕ is a complete set of orbit representatives of the conjugation action of CA(ϕ) on

AutC(Q) (resp. on AutC(Q) ∩ CA(ϕ)), for every ϕ ∈ X;

• Zϕ,ψ is a complete set of orbit representatives of the natural action of CA(ϕ) ∩ CA(ψ)

on Z(Q)/Im(id − (ϕ + ψ)).

Proof. Consider the equivalence relation of AutC(Q) × AutC(Q) × Z(Q) implicitly deﬁned
by Theorem 2.13. By Lemma 3.1, it remains to describe when two triples (ϕ, ψ, c1) and
(ϕ, ψ, c2) are equivalent, where ϕ ∈ X, ψ ∈ Yϕ and c1, c2 ∈ Z(Q).

Let I = Im(id − (ϕ + ψ)). Using Lemma 3.2, for any γ ∈ Aut(Q) we have c2 = γ(c1 + u)
for some u ∈ I if and only if c2 ∈ γ(c1 + I) = γ(c1) + I, which is equivalent to c2 + I =
γ(c1) + I = γ(c1 + I).
(cid:3)

3.4. Calculating with loops of order 243. Recall that all six commutative Moufang
loops of order 243 were constructed by Kepka and Nˇemec [16]. Moufang loops of order
81 were classiﬁed by Nagy and Vojtˇechovsk´y in [22], and Moufang loops of order 243 were
classiﬁed by Slattery and Zenisek in [23].

The 71 nonassociative Moufang loops of order 243 can be found in the LOOPS [21] package
for GAP [11] and can be obtained by calling MoufangLoop(243,i). The six nonassociative
commutative Moufang loops correspond to the indices i ∈ {1, 2, 5, 56, 57, 67}.

The default method in LOOPS for calculating automorphism groups of loops is powerful
enough to calculate automorphism groups of Moufang loops of order 81 and even of some
of order 243. We adopted the default algorithm, made a better use of global variables and
ran it with diﬀerent choices of generators (to which the algorithm is highly sensitive). We
succeeded in calculating the automorphism groups for the six commutative Moufang loops
of order 243. The longest calculation, for MoufangLoop(243,5), took several hours.

The calculation of the sets AutC(Q) and AutCO(Q) and of the respective actions of the

automorphism group was described in the previous two subsections.

To get a feel for the complexity of the calculations, the sizes of the various sets of auto-
morphisms encountered during the enumeration can be found in Table 1. Here X/G denotes
the number of orbits of the action of a group G on a set X (where the action is as described
above). The loop notation n/k refers to MoufangLoop(n,k).

4. Results

4.1. Enumeration. Let c(Q) denote the number of 1-central quasigroups, t(Q) the number
of trimedial quasigroups, d(Q) the number of distributive quasigroups, dM(Q) the num-
ber of distributive Mendelsohn quasigroups, and dS(Q) the number of distributive Steiner
quasigroups over a loop Q, up to isomorphism.

Table 2 displays these numbers for every nonassociative commutative Moufang loop of
order 81 and 243. The entries for order 81 can be found already in [9, 15, 16] and have
been independently veriﬁed by our calculations. The entries in the last row can be found in
[3] and have also been independently veriﬁed. The remaining entries for order 243 are new.
Since all the commutative Moufang loops in the table are nonassociative, the corresponding
quasigroups are non-medial by Lemma 2.8.

Table 2. Enumeration of various classes of aﬃne quasigroups over a given
commutative Moufang loop.

In Table 3 we summarize the results of Table 2 by order, and we use a notation analogous to
that of Table 2. For instance, t(n) denotes the number of non-medial trimedial quasigroups
of order n up to isomorphism. Note that we have not enumerated non-medial 1-central
quasigroups of order 243, since this would require also the enumeration of all quasigroups
Q(Q, +, ϕ, ψ, c), where (Q, +) is an abelian group of order 243 and ϕ, ψ are non-commuting
automorphisms of (Q, +); a diﬃcult task (see [26]).

4.2. Explicit constructions. Detailed results of the enumeration, including arithmetical
forms for all the quasigroups, can be obtained from the third author upon request.

To present a sample of the detailed results, we now give explicit formulas for all elements
of AutCO(Q) up to conjugacy in Aut(Q), where Q is MoufangLoop(243,i) with i = 56 or
i = 57. The corresponding distributive quasigroups can be obtained readily using Corollary
2.12. In particular, we obtain an explicit description of all non-aﬃne distributive Mendelsohn
triple systems of order 243.

11

Example 4.1. The loop Q = MoufangLoop(243,56) is the direct product MoufangLoop(81,1)×
Z3. According to [16], the loop MoufangLoop(81,1) is isomorphic to (Z4

3, +), where

(a1, b1, c1, d1) + (a2, b2, c2, d2) = (a1 + a2 + (d1 − d2)(b1c2 − c1b2), b1 + b2, c1 + c2, d1 + d2).

The associator subloop is A(Q) = Z3×0×0×0×0 and the center is Z(Q) = Z3×0×0×0×Z3.
The elements of AutCO(Q) up to conjugacy by Aut(Q) are given by the following six

endomorphisms into the center:

ˆψ1 : (a, b, c, d, e) 7→ (0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
ˆψ3 : (a, b, c, d, e) 7→ (e, 0, 0, 0, 0),
ˆψ5 : (a, b, c, d, e) 7→ (b, 0, 0, 0, c),

ˆψ2 : (a, b, c, d, e) 7→ (b, 0, 0, 0, 0),
ˆψ4 : (a, b, c, d, e) 7→ (0, 0, 0, 0, b),
ˆψ6 : (a, b, c, d, e) 7→ (e, 0, 0, 0, b).

It is straightforward to check that each of these mappings is an endomorphism into the center
with a unique ﬁxed point, and that all id − ψi = 2id − ˆψi are permutations. By Lemma 2.1,
ψi ∈ AutCO(Q) for every i.

To check that the six mappings are pairwise non-conjugate, we use the following criterion:
Let α ∈ End(Q) and ξ ∈ Aut(Q). If H is a characteristic subloop of Q, we have αξ(H) =
ξα(H). If both H and α(H) are characteristic subloops of Q then α(H) = αξ(H). Now
observe that:

• Im( ˆψ1) = 0,
• Im( ˆψ2) = A(Q) and ˆψ2(Z(Q)) = 0,
• Im( ˆψ3) = A(Q) and ˆψ3(Z(Q)) 6= 0,
• Im( ˆψ4) is neither A(Q), nor Z(Q),
• Im( ˆψ5) = Z(Q) and ˆψ5(Z(Q)) = 0,
• Im( ˆψ6) = Z(Q) and ˆψ6(Z(Q)) 6= 0.

Example 4.2. The loop Q = MoufangLoop(243,57) is the direct product MoufangLoop(81,2)×
Z3. According to [16], the loop MoufangLoop(81,2) is isomorphic to (Z2

3 × Z9, +), where

(a1, b1, c1) + (a2, b2, c2) = (a1 + a2, b1 + b2, c1 + c2 + 3(c1 − c2)(a1b2 − b1a2)).

The associator subloop is A(Q) = 0 × 0 × 3Z9 × 0 and the center is Z(Q) = 0 × 0 × 3Z9 × Z3.
The elements of AutCO(Q) up to conjugacy by Aut(Q) are given by the following endo-

morphisms into the center:

ˆψ1 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 0, 0),
ˆψ3 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 6c, 0),
ˆψ5 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3a, 0),
ˆψ7 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 0, c mod 3),
ˆψ9 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3c, a),
ˆψ11 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3a, c mod 3),
ˆψ13 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3d, c mod 3),

ˆψ2 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3c, 0),
ˆψ4 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3d, 0),
ˆψ6 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 0, a),
ˆψ8 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3a, b),
ˆψ10 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 6c, a),
ˆψ12 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3d, a),
ˆψ14 : (a, b, c, d) 7→ (0, 0, 3d, 2c mod 3).

Again, it is straightforward to check that the corresponding mappings ψi belong to AutCO(Q).
To show that they are pairwise non-conjugate, ﬁrst notice that ˆψ1 = 0, ˆψ2 = 3id and

12

ˆψ3 = 6id, so they commute with any automorphism. To distinguish the remaining mappings,
consider also the characteristic subloop B = {x ∈ Q : x3 = 1} = Z3 × Z3 × 3Z9 × Z3 and
observe that

• Im( ˆψi) = A(Q) iﬀ i = 4, 5; here ˆψ5(Z(Q)) = 0 but ˆψ4(Z(Q)) 6= 0;
• Im( ˆψi) is of order 3 but not A(Q) iﬀ i = 6, 7; here ˆψ7(B) = 0 but ˆψ6(B) 6= 0,
• Im( ˆψi) = Z(Q) for i = 8, . . . , 14;

– ˆψi(Z(Q)) = 0 for i = 8, 9, 10, 11, but

∗ ˆψ8(B) = Z(Q),
∗ ˆψ11(B) = A(Q),
∗ both ˆψ9(B), ˆψ10(B) have order 3, 6= A(Q); we have ˆψ9 = ˆψ2 + ˆψ6 and if
6 = ˆψ10 − ˆψ2 = ˆψ9 which is

9 = ˆψ10 then ˆψξ

there existed ξ such that ˆψξ
impossible;

– ˆψi(Z(Q)) = A(Q) for i = 12, 13, 14, but

∗ ˆψ12(B) = Z(Q),
∗ ˆψ13(B) = ˆψ14(B) = A(Q); they cannot be conjugate, because their squares,

ˆψ2
13 = ˆψ2 and ˆψ2

14 = ˆψ3, are not.

Which of these quasigroups give rise to distributive Mendelsohn triple systems? According

to Corollary 2.17:

• for Q = MoufangLoop(243,56) whose exponent is 3, these are precisely the mappings

ˆψi with ˆψ2

i = 0, which is the case for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

• for Q = MoufangLoop(243,57), since 3Z(Q) = 0, the equation is equivalent to

ˆψ2
i = −3id, which is satisﬁed only for i = 14.

Using Corollary 2.12, the triple systems on Q are deﬁned by

{(x, y, 2x − y + ˆψ(y − x)) : x, y ∈ Q}.

4.3. Commuting 1-central automorphisms. Looking at Table 2, we see that in some
small nonassociative commutative Moufang loops Q, any two 1-central automorphisms of Q
commute. This is partly explained by Proposition 4.4.

Lemma 4.3. Let Q = (Q, +) be a commutative Moufang loop and let ϕ, ψ be 1-central
automorphisms of Q. Then ϕψ = ψϕ if and only if ˆϕ ˆψ = ˆψ ˆϕ.

Proof. We must proceed carefully since the addition of mappings on Q is not necessarily
an associative operation. However, for any α ∈ AutC(Q) and β, γ ∈ Aut(Q) we have
ˆα + (β + γ) = ( ˆα + β) + γ because Im( ˆα) ⊆ Z(Q). In particular, we have

(4.1)
Now, ˆϕ ˆψ = (id + ϕ) ˆψ = ˆψ + ϕ ˆψ = ˆψ + ϕ + ϕψ and, by symmetry, ˆψ ˆϕ = ˆϕ + ψ + ψϕ. Thanks
to (4.1), we see that ϕ and ψ commute if and only if ˆϕ and ˆψ commute.
(cid:3)

ˆψ + ϕ = ˆψ + ˆϕ − id = ˆϕ + ˆψ − id = ˆϕ + ψ.

Proposition 4.4. Let Q be a nonassociative commutative Moufang loop of order a power of 3
such that Z(Q) is cyclic and Q/Z(Q) is associative. Then any two 1-central automorphisms
of Q commute.

13

Proof. Let ϕ, ψ be 1-central automorphisms of Q = (Q, +). By Lemma 4.3, it suﬃces to
show that ˆϕ ˆψ = ˆψ ˆϕ.

By Lemma 2.1, ˆϕ and ˆψ are endomorphism into Z(Q). Any endomorphism into Z(Q) has
all associators (x + (y + z)) − ((x + y) + z) in its kernel, and thus vanishes on the associator
subloop A(Q). Since Z(Q) is cyclic, there are integers a, b such that ˆϕ(z) = az, ˆψ(z) = bz
for every z ∈ Z(Q).

By our assumption, Q/Z(Q) is associative and 0 < A(Q). Thus 0 < A(Q) < Z(Q) and
the restriction of each of ˆϕ, ˆψ onto Z(Q) has nontrivial kernel. Since |Z(Q)| is a power of 3,
it follows that 3 divides a and b. Then ax, bx ∈ Z(Q) for every x ∈ Q, and we calculate

ˆϕ ˆψ(x) = a ˆψ(x) = ˆψ(ax) = bax = abx = ˆϕ(bx) = b ˆϕ(x) = ˆψ ˆϕ(x)

for every x ∈ Q.

(cid:3)

Every commutative Moufang loop of order ≤ 35 is centrally nilpotent of class at most
two [16, Lemma 1.6]. Both of the nonassociative commutative Moufang loops of order 34
have cyclic centers, and so do two of the six nonassociative Moufang loops of order 35 (see
Table 1). Proposition 4.4 therefore applies to these loops. However, Proposition 4.4 does
not tell the whole story, as there are commutative Moufang loops of order 35 that have a
non-cyclic center, yet any two of its 1-central automorphisms commute.

We thank Prof. Anthony Evans for historical comments on orthomorphisms.
