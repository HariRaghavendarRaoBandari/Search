ABSTRACT

We present a code for generating synthetic SEDs and intensity maps from Smoothed Particle Hydro-
dynamics simulation snapshots. The code is based on the Lucy (1999) Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer
method, i.e. it follows discrete luminosity packets, emitted from external and/or embedded sources,
as they propagate through a density ﬁeld, and then uses their trajectories to compute the radiative
equilibrium temperature of the ambient dust. The density is not mapped onto a grid, and there-
fore the calculation is performed at exactly the same resolution as the hydrodynamics. We present
two example calculations using this method. First, we demonstrate that the code strictly adheres to
Kirchhoﬀ’s law of radiation. Second, we present synthetic intensity maps and spectra of an embedded
protostellar multiple system. The algorithm uses data structures that are already constructed for
other purposes in modern particle codes. It is therefore relatively simple to implement.

INTRODUCTION

Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) is a stochas-
tic method for simulating radiative transfer through a
medium.
Individual MCRT calculations are accurate
but slow. Fortunately, they are trivial to parallelise and
therefore well suited to modern multi-threaded CPUs.
MCRT is often used to post-process simulation snap-
shots and can be adapted to solve a variety of radiative
processes. For example, codes such as hyperion (Ro-
bitaille 2011) and radmc-3d (Dullemond 2012) calculate
the dust and molecular line emissivities. These data can
then be used to generate realistic synthetic observations.
Other MCRT codes include mocassin (Ercolano et al.
2003), which models photoionisation fronts, and torus
(Harries 2011), which models time-dependent radiative
transfer.

Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) (Lucy 1977;
Gingold & Monaghan 1977) is a mesh-free method of
solving the equations of ﬂuid dynamics. A discrete set
of particles are used to model the density distribution.
These particles are smoothed over one another using a
kernel function with smoothing length h. By letting h
vary with density, the particles can model a ﬁeld span-
ning many orders of magnitude in density. This prop-
erty makes SPH an attractive scheme for modelling as-
trophysical systems such as star forming clouds (e.g. Bate
2009; Lomax et al. 2014, 2015), galactic discs (e.g. Dobbs
et al. 2006, 2011) and the cosmic web (e.g. Springel
& Hernquist 2003). Open-source SPH codes include
gadget-2 (Springel 2005) and gandalf (Hubber &
Rosotti 2013).

Performing MCRT calculations on density ﬁelds from
SPH simulations usually involves mapping the particles
onto an adaptive-mesh (e.g. Stamatellos & Whitworth
2005; Robitaille 2011; Rundle et al. 2010). This funda-
mentally changes the structure of the density ﬁeld by
adding noise and/or merging several particles into a sin-
gle cell. Another option is to use the particle positions to
construct a Voronoi tessellation (e.g. Hubber et al. 2016).

oliver.lomax@astro.cf.ac.uk

This is less noisy than an adaptive mesh, although the
implementation is more complicated. Nevertheless, both
methods alter the SPH density structure by replacing
smoothed particles with uniform density cells.

In this paper we present the new code spamcart (short
for Smoothed PArticle Monte CArlo Radiative Transfer).
The code performs MCRT calculations using the proper-
ties of the particles’ smoothing kernels. Therefore, post-
processing calculations are performed at exactly the same
resolution as the SPH simulation. The algorithm is simi-
lar to other ray-tracing and Monte Carlo methods used in
SPH, (e.g. Altay et al. 2008; Forgan & Rice 2010). How-
ever, this is the ﬁrst time such an algorithm has been used
to perform full MCRT calculations. The method utilises
the pre-existing neighbour-ﬁnding/gravity tree found in
modern SPH codes, and is therefore relatively simple to
implement.

In §2 we describe the general Monte Carlo method we
use for radiative transfer.
In §3 we explain how this
method can be applied to smoothed particles. In §4 we
present the some example calculations, including a phys-
ical benchmark. In §5 we list some future implementa-
tions and in §6 we present the summary.

2. MONTE CARLO RADIATIVE TRANSFER

The method presented here is an adaptation of the
Lucy (1999) algorithm, modiﬁed to operate on smoothed
particles rather than a grid of uniform density cells. Most
of the operations involve drawing a random variate U[a, b]
from the Uniform distribution in the interval (a, b).

2.1. Luminosity packet trajectories

A radiation source with luminosity L emits Nγ lumi-
nosity packets. Each packet is emitted from an origin
o in direction n.
If the radiator is an isotropic point
source, n is given by polar angles

φ = U[−π, π] ,
cos θiso = U[−1, 1] .

(1)

2

O. Lomax & A. P. Whitworth

If there is an external isotropic radiation ﬁeld, o is a
random point on a closed surface and n is given by polar
angles

where gλ is the mean scattering cosine. Hence, relative
to the pre-scattering direction,

cos θsur =

The process of absorption then re-emission and/or scat-
tering is repeated until the packet exits the system.

2.2. Emissivity distribution

For a medium in radiative equilibrium, the energy
emission rate is equal to the energy absorption rate ˙A,
i.e.

˙A = 4 κp σsb T 4 .

(11)
Here, σsb is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, T is the lo-
cal temperature and κp is the Planck mean absorption
coeﬃcient:

κλ Bλ(T ) dλ

κp =

mated by summing over the path lengths lj of luminosity
packets which pass through V ,

We can estimate T , and therefore the mass emissivity
distribution, by calculating ˙A and solving Eqn. 11 for
T . However, Eqn. 13 depends on the trajectories of
the luminosity packets; the trajectories depend on the
emissivity distribution. Therefore several iterations are
required to reach an equilibrium solution.
3. SPAMCART ALGORITHM

The main algorithm of the spamcart code consists of
two tasks: (i) we calculate the trajectories of luminosity
packets through an ensemble of smoothed particles and
(ii) we estimate ˙A for each particle. Here, we detail how
these are achieved.

3.1. Density

For an ensemble of smoothed particles, each with po-
sition xi, mass mi and smoothing length hi, the density
at any point in space is given by

ρ(x) =

mi
h3
i

w(si) ,

si = (cid:107)x − xi(cid:107)

,

(14)

hi

(cid:88)

where w(s) is the kernel function. Most kernel functions
have compact support, i.e. they are only ﬁnite within
ξ smoothing lengths. We use the M4 cubic spline ker-
nel (Monaghan & Lattanzio 1985) which has ξ = 2 (see
Appendix A). The smoothing length of each particle is
calculated so that

where θsur is the angle between n and the inward sur-
face normal. Each packet has energy ε0 ≡ (L ∆t/Nγ)1
and wavelength λ, drawn randomly from the spectral en-
ergy distribution of the source. For the surface of a star,
approximated as a blackbody, the equation

Bλ(T ) dλ(cid:48)

is solved for λ, where T is the temperature of the source.

Here, ρ is the density of the medium and χλ is the mass
extinction coeﬃcient. Solving Eqn. 5 for l is one of the
more computationally demanding aspects of MCRT and
is covered in the next section.

Once a packet has travelled distance l, it is either ab-

sorbed or scattered at position

onew = x + l o .

(6)

A packet is absorbed if

aλ < U[0, 1] ,

(7)
where aλ is the albedo of the medium. Otherwise the
packet is scattered. An absorbed packet is immediately
re-emitted with a new wavelength drawn from the emis-
sivity distribution of the medium. This is achieved by
solving the equation

for λ, where κλ ≡ (1− aλ) χλ is the monochromatic mass
absorption coeﬃcient and T is the temperature of the
medium at onew. If the packet is scattered, λ remains
unchanged and nnew is scattered away from n by a ran-
dom angle θsct. Here, θsct is drawn from the Henyey &
Greenstein (1941) phase function:

l intersecting a particle at position xi with compact support s ≤ ξ.
The other terms are deﬁned in §3.3 .

These equations are solved by iteration and we normally
adopt η = 1.2 (as suggested by Price & Monaghan 2004).

3.2. Scatter Calculation

The value of some arbitrary quantity Z(x) can be esti-
mated by scattering the same quantity, from each particle
to x, via the kernel function:

The gradient of the M4 kernel function is given in Ap-
pendix A .

3.3. Optical depth

The set of all points along a ray is deﬁned by x(cid:48) =
o + t n, where 0 ≤ t ≤ l. Here, o is the origin, n is the
direction unit vector and l is the length of the ray. The
optical depth at wavelength λ along the ray is given by

Fig. 2.— A diagram of multiple particles which are intersected
by a ray of length tmax. The optical depth along the ray may be
calculated using Eqn. 18 . Note that tmax is greater than l. This
is because l is calculated by iteration and the ﬁrst iterate must be
an overestimate.

and χλi is the mass extinction coeﬃcient of particle i.
A diagram of this system for a single particle is given in
Fig. 1 . The analytical form of W (c, s) for the M4 kernel
in given in Appendix A.

In order to calculate Eqn. 18, we must ﬁrst identify
all the particles which are intersected by the ray (see
Fig. 2). This can be performed eﬃciently by walking a
tree-structure (see Fig. 3) and opening cells which pass
the slab test (e.g. Williams et al. 2005, see Appendix B).
These trees are a standard element of SPH codes, used
to optimise neighbour-ﬁnding and gravity calculations.

3.4. Propagating luminosity packets

We propagate a luminosity packet, starting at o, trav-
elling in direction n. Initially, the ray has length l0. Here
l0 is a modest overestimate of the intended value of l (see
Eqn 5). A good choice of l0 is provided by a second order

Fig. 3.— A schematic of the cells of a particle tree. Each cell
has an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) which encompasses the
smoothing volume of all the particles in the cell (see Appendix B
for more details).
If the ray intersects the AABB of a cell with
sub-cells, the sub-cells are recursively checked. If the cell has no
sub-cells (shaded pink), all of its particles are added to the ray.

γ (o) · n, 0) .
Here, the inverse mean-free-path l−1
γ = χλ ρ is estimated
via a scatter calculation and ζ is an overestimation factor
which we set to 1.2 .
We use a Newton-Raphson root-ﬁnding method to iter-
atively solve τ(cid:48)
− τ = 0 for l. We terminate the iterations
− τ|/τ ≤ 0.01 . For some values of l0, τ(cid:48) is less
when |τ(cid:48)
than τ and no solution exists. Here, either the luminos-
ity packet has left the ensemble of SPH particles or l0 is
too short. In the ﬁrst case, the calculation for that lumi-
nosity packet is complete. In the second case, a new ray
is constructed with the same direction and new origin
onew = o + l0 n. The calculation is then repeated with
τnew = τ − τ(cid:48).

3.5. Estimating the energy absorption rate

The energy absorption rate for an individual particle
is estimated by summing the column densities along all
packet trajectories:

˙A =

ε0
∆t

1
m

κλj ςj .

(21)

(cid:88)

j

Here ςj is the column density along the path of luminos-
ity packet j through the particle. Estimating ˙A requires
almost no computational expense as the values of ςj have
already been computed whilst propagating the luminos-
ity packets.

The absorption rate from the previous iteration is used
when randomly generating a new emission wavelength.

Fig. 4.— Schematic of a single pixel (small square) of an intensity
map (large square). The ray passes through the centre of the pixel
at an angle normal to the surface of the map.

The value of
˙A at any position can be found via a scat-
ter calculation. The radiative equilibrium calculation is
complete when the change in ˙Ai (or temperature Ti) be-
tween iterations is less than a desired tolerance.

3.6. Generating intensity maps

We generate intensity maps of the dust emission via
ray tracing. We construct a virtual rectangular screen
facing the ensemble of particles. This screen is divided
into Npix pixels. We construct Npix rays, each of which
has inﬁnite length and passes through the centre of a
pixel with direction normal to the screen. A schematic
of a single pixel is show in Fig. 4 .

Each ray intersects Nray particles. These are sorted
into descending order of distance from the pixel. The
intensity of the pixel is given by INray. This is calculated
by iteration:
Ii = Ii−1 exp(−χλi ςi) +
[1 − exp(−χλi ςi)] ,
(22)
where i = 1, 2, . . . , Npart. In the case where i = 1, I0 is
the background intensity.

The intensity from point sources (e.g. stars) may also
be added to the map. This is achieved by (i) locating
the pixel in which the source lies, (ii) calculating the
optical depth τ between the source and the pixel and
(iii) adding the intensity of the source, scaled by a factor
of (Asrc/Apix) exp(−τ ), to the pixel. Here Asrc is the
unresolved cross-sectional area of the source and Apix is
the area of the pixel.

4. EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS

In the following calculations, we use the dust optical
properties derived by (Li & Draine 2001). Here, the
dust is a mixture of carbonaceous and amorphous sili-
cate grains. The size distribution follows Weingartner &
Draine (2001) with Rv = 5.5 and is normalised to give
a dust-to-gas mass ratio of one percent. The code does
not currently support imaging of scattered light (see §5),
so we set the albedo to zero, i.e. κλ ≡ χλ.
We present two examples. The ﬁrst is a benchmark
which tests the ability of the algorithm to reach thermal

equilibrium with a radiation ﬁeld. In the second exam-
ple, we use the outputs of an SPH simulation to generate
spectra and intensity maps of an embedded multiple sys-
tem.

4.1. Blackbody radiation ﬁeld

4.1.1. Undiluted blackbody radiation ﬁeld

In an undiluted blackbody radiation ﬁeld, the intensity
Iλ(x, n) is equal to the Planck function Bλ(Tbb). By con-
struction, an absorbing/emitting object in this ﬁeld has
a surface intensity equal to Bλ(Tbb). Following Kirch-
hoﬀ’s law of radiation—a good absorber is an equally
good emitter—the surface temperature must therefore be
equal to Tbb. Furthermore, because the emission spec-
trum is identical to the absorption spectrum, the object
is invisible with respect to the background intensity.

4.1.2. Set up

We set up a sphere of Npart = 3 × 105 particles. The
sphere has radius R = 2000 au and the density proﬁle
of a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere, truncated at dimen-
sionless radius ξ = 6.451 . In the ﬁrst instance, we give
the sphere mass M = 1 M(cid:12) (optically thin), in the sec-
ond M = 100 M(cid:12) (optically thick). We place the sphere
in an undiluted Tbb = 60K blackbody radiation ﬁeld.

Fig. 6.— The spectral energy distribution (SED) through the
centre of the sphere in Fig.
5, with M = 1 M(cid:12) (top) and
M = 100 M(cid:12) (bottom). In both cases, the sphere is illuminated
by an undiluted 60 K blackbody. The left y-axis gives the inten-
sity calculated by successive iterations of the algorithm. The bot-
tom most red line shows the initial intensity, where each particle
has a temperature of 10 K. The lines above show the SED con-
verging towards a 60 K blackbody (black long-dashed line). The
right y-axis give the optical depth through the centre of the sphere
(short-dashed black line).

This is simulated by constructing a virtual shell which
encompasses all the particles and their smoothing ker-
nels, i.e. Rfield (cid:38) 2000 au. The shell is given luminosity
Lfield = 4 π R2field σsb T 4. This luminosity is divided into
Nγ = 106 luminosity packets, which are directed inwards
towards the particles. The wavelength of each packet
is drawn randomly from the Planck function Bλ(Tbb).
Each particle is given an initial temperature T = 10 K
and spamcart is iterated until the mean change in tem-
perature is less than 1 K.

4.1.3. Results

Fig. 6 shows the spectral energy distribution (SED)
though the centre of the sphere.
In the optically thin
case, we see that the SED converges on a 60 K blackbody
after about three iterations. In the optically thick case,
the SED converges after about ﬁve iterations.

4.1.4. Diluted blackbody radiation ﬁeld

We repeat the optically thick simulation, this time with
a 120 K blackbody, diluted by a factor of 1/16. In this
instance, we expect the dust to reach local radiative equi-
librium at some temperature T < 120 K. Here, when a
luminosity packet is absorbed by the dust, it is usually
re-emitted at a longer wavelength. The sphere should
therefore appear to glow, relative to the background, at

lengths.

sphere. The left column shows the results of the undi-
luted blackbody ﬁeld, the right column shows the results
for the diluted ﬁeld. The sphere in the undiluted ﬁeld
is almost invisible relative to the background intensity
at wavelengths between 30 and 160 µm. There is some
visible noise at 30 µm, of order ten percent. Here, the op-
tical depth through the sphere is very high (τ ∼ 100) and
the intensity is very sensitive to temperature ﬂuctuations
across the the sphere’s outer surface. The sphere in the
diluted ﬁeld behaves as expected; it is brighter than the
background at 160 µm and darker than the background
at 30 µm.

4.2. Embedded sextuple system

We demonstrate a more realistic application of the al-
gorithm by calculating the dust emission from a proto-
stellar multiple system. High order multiple systems,
i.e. N(cid:63) ≥ 3, are observed amongst mature ﬁeld stars
(e.g. Tokovinin 2008; Eggleton & Tokovinin 2008). These
systems are more common amongst pre-Main Sequence
stars, embedded in star forming regions such as Taurus
and Ophiuchus (e.g. Leinert et al. 1993; Ratzka et al.
2005; Kraus et al. 2011). Furthermore, similar systems
form routinely in simulations of molecular clouds and
cores (e.g. Delgado-Donate et al. 2004; Bate 2009; Lo-
max et al. 2014, 2015).

4.2.1. Set up

We take a snapshot from one of the SPH simulations
presented by Lomax et al. (2014)2. Here, a 1.3 M(cid:12)
core collapses and fragments into seven protostars (rep-
resented by sink particles). One of these is ejected
from the core and the remaining six form a stable sex-
tuple system. At t = 105 years (after the initial col-
lapse), the protostars in the sextuple have masses be-
tween 0.08 M(cid:12) < M(cid:63) < 0.15 M(cid:12). The ejected protostar
has mass M = 0.01 M(cid:12). The remainder of the initial
mass (Mgas = 0.65 M(cid:12), Npart = 6.5× 104) is distributed
between discs and and a diﬀuse envelope.
We irradiate the system with an undiluted 2.73 K
blackbody radiation ﬁeld and a 10000 K blackbody ﬁeld,
diluted by a factor of 5 × 10−15. This represents contri-
butions from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
and the galactic stellar population. The protostars
are treated as blackbody sources with R = 4 R(cid:12) and
1100 K < T < 1500 K; these temperatures are estimated
using the Stamatellos et al. (2011) episodic accretion
model.

4.2.2. Intensity maps and spectra

Fig. 7 shows column density and intensity maps of
the embedded system. The system is viewed both face-
on and edge-on. In the face-on view, we see a balanced
quadruple system (top right) in orbit with a binary sys-
tem (bottom left), separated by S ∼ 400 au.
2 These simulations use initial conditions drawn from distribu-
tion functions that reproduce the observed properties of the cores
in Ophiuchus. The simulation used here is No. 52, with episodic
radiative feedback.

In both face-on and edge-on views, the intensity at
850 and 350 µm roughly traces the column density. At
160 µm, face-on, only the the inner regions of the discs
are visible. When viewed edge-on, the discs are opaque
and signiﬁcant intensity is only seen above and below
their midplanes.

Fig. 8 shows the emission spectrum of the system.
When viewed face on, we may deﬁne diﬀerent wave-
bands, dominated by diﬀerent sources of radiation. Be-
tween 103 µm < λ ≤ 104µm, the dust is optically thin
and most of the radiation is from the CMB. Between
10 µm < λ ≤ 103µm, most of the radiation is from
dust emission. Starlight is largely unattenuated in these
wavebands, but its fraction of the total emission is very
low. At wavelengths less than 10 µm, the majority of
the emission is attenuated starlight. Similar dust emis-
sion is seen when the system is viewed edge on. How-
ever, the starlight is almost completely extinguished at
λ < 200 µm. We note that the level of extinction at
λ < 10 µm is probably exaggerated as we have not cap-
tured scattered light in these spectra. Nevertheless, in
the face-on view, we still see the double peaked spectra
typical of protostellar discs (e.g. Robitaille 2011; Whit-
ney et al. 2013).

5. FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

At present, we are able to generate intensity maps of
the dust emission, plus attenuated light from background
and point sources. However, it is desirable to also capture
light scattered oﬀ of the dust. This can be achievable by
modifying Eqn. 22. Here, the term Bλ(T )κλ represents
the amount of dust emission per unit solid angle, per unit
wavelength, per unit mass. We may add an extra term
which accounts for scattered light:

Bλ(T )κλ → Bλ(T )κλ +

(cid:88)

Φ(θj)σλj ςj .

(23)
Here, σλ ≡ aλ χλ is the mass scattering coeﬃcient and θj
is the angle between luminosity packet j and the view-
ing angle. The sum is only over luminosity packets with
wavelengths in the interval (λ, λ + ∆λ). The scattering
term must be calculated during the Monte Carlo itera-
tion, so the viewing angle and wavelength interval must
be known beforehand.

Other future developments include use of the partial
diﬀusion approximation and modiﬁed random walk for
regions of high optical depth (Min et al. 2009). The
spamcart code will shortly be made open-source and
uploaded to the GitHub repository.

6. SUMMARY

We have developed a method for performing MCRT
calculations directly on a distribution of SPH particles
The algorithm operates diﬀerently from uniform density
cell methods, but the two schemes are mathematically
equivalent. This allows an MCRT calculation to be per-
formed on an SPH snapshot with (i) no loss in density
resolution and (ii) no introduction of noise from mapping
particles to cells.

We present a version of this algorithm that uses the
Lucy (1999) method to compute (i) the propagation of
luminosity packets through a medium and (ii) the ra-
diative equilibrium temperature. The trajectories of the

packets rely on the temperature of the medium so the
calculation must be solved by iteration.

We provide two example calculations using the
smoothed particle MCRT method. First, we show than
a cloud is invisible when it is bathed in an undiluted
blackbody radiation ﬁeld. This holds for both optically
thin and optically thick cases. Therefore the code obeys
to Kirchhoﬀ’s law of thermal radiation. We note that
this is a powerful test of any radiative transfer code and
can be applied to any conﬁguration. Conversely, a cloud
which has reached radiative equilibrium with a diluted
blackbody ﬁeld glows at long wavelengths and casts a sil-
houette at short wavelengths. Second, we generate inten-
sity maps and spectra of protostellar and dust emission
in an embedded sextuple system. Here, a double peaked
disc spectrum is seen when the system is observed face
on. When viewed edge on, the opacity of the disc blocks
nearly all of the starlight.

Future additions to the code include the addition of
scattered light to synthetic observations and optimisa-
tions for optically thick regions of dust. The code, writ-
ten in Fortran 2003/08 with OpenMP parallelisation, will
be made publicly available in the near future.

system. Values are integrated over the map area shown in Fig.

bottom frame shows the spectrum from an edge-on view. The solid

fraction of emission from protostars. The dashed black line shows

B. K-D TREE

We use a k-d tree (in three dimensions) to ﬁnd the particles intersected by a ray. We construct the tree by placing
the entire ensemble of particles into a root cell. The root cell contains two branch cells. We select the dimension k
across which the particle position x has the greatest variance. All particles with xk up to and including the median
value are placed in the ﬁrst cell and the remaining particles are placed in the second cell. This process is repeated
recursively until each cell contains 8 or fewer particles, in which case they are leaf cells. For each cell, we calculate
the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) that encompasses all of the particle smoothing volumes within the cell.

We ﬁnd the particles intersected by a ray by using the slab method (e.g. Williams et al. 2005). Consider a ray with
max. Along each

origin o, direction n and length l. Also, consider an AABB with lower limits b

O. Lomax & A. P. Whitworth

Starting at the root cell, we check for an AABB-ray intersection. If the result is true, we open the branch cells and
recursively repeat the process until we encounter a leaf cell. If the leaf cell is intersected by the ray, the cell’s contents
are added to a particle list. This method is not exclusive to k-d trees and may be used with any axis aligned tree,
such as an octree (e.g. Barnes & Hut 1986).
