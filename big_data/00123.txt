Abstract

It is shown that analytically soluble bound states of the Schr¨odinger equation for a large class of

systems relevant to atomic and molecular physics can be obtained by means of the Laplace trans-

form of the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation. It is also shown that all closed-form eigenfunctions

are expressed in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials. The generalized Morse potential is

used as an illustration.

INTRODUCTION

Some exactly soluble systems with importance in atomic and molecular physics have

been approached in the literature on quantum mechanics with a myriad of methods. Among
such systems is the Morse potential a(e−αx − 2e−2αx) [1]-[19], the pseudoharmonic poten-
tial a (x/b − b/x)2 [4]-[5], [20]-[31], and the Kratzer-Fues potential a (b2/x2 − 2b/x) and its
modiﬁed version a (b2/x2 − b/x) [4]-[5], [12], [30]-[34]. More general exactly soluble systems
have also been appreciated: the generalized Morse potential Ae−αx + Be−2αx [31], [35]-[39],

the singular harmonic oscillator Ax2 + Bx−2 [3]-[5], [19], [36], [40]-[52], the singular Coulomb

potential Ax−1 + Bx−2 [2]-[5], [36], [40], [48], [50]-[51], [53]-[57], and some ring-shaped po-

tentials (see, e.g. [19] and references therein).

The integral transform methods have proven to be useful and powerful for solving or-

dinary diﬀerential equations because they can convert the original equation into a simpler

diﬀerential equation or into an algebraic equation. The Laplace transform method applied

to quantum mechanics was used by Schr¨odinger into the discussion of radial eigenfunction of

the hydrogen atom [58], and later Engleﬁeld approached the three-dimensional Schr¨odinger

equation with diverse spherically symmetric potentials [59]. More than twenty years later

the hydrogen atom was reexamined with the Laplace transform method [60]. Recently,

some interest has been revived in searching bound-state solutions of the Schr¨odinger equa-

tion via Laplace transform method. For some years now one-dimensional problems with the

1/x [61], Morse [62], generalized Morse [63], Dirac delta [64] and harmonic oscillator [65]

potentials, three-dimensional problems with the singular harmonic oscillator, the singular

Coulomb [66], some ring-shaped [67] potentials, and the D-dimensional harmonic oscillator

[68], have been solved for the Laplace transform. With fulcrum on the relation mapping the

behaviour of the eigenfunction near inﬁnity and the Laplace transform near isolated singu-

lar points, Engleﬁeld [59] found the spectrum of three-dimensional problems by imposing

that the radial eigenfunction vanishes at the origin. Engleﬁeld’s recipe, spiced up with the

relation mapping the behaviour of the eigenfunction near the origin and its corresponding

transform near inﬁnity, was used in Ref. [65] in order to obtain the complete set of bound-

state solutions for the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator without using the closed-form

solution for the Laplace transform. Furthermore, the class of problems was enlarged to

include eigenfunctions satisfying homogeneous Neumann conditions at the origin.

2

In the present paper, the spiced Engleﬁeld’s recipe is followed with attention restricted

to systems that after factorizing the behaviour at the neighbourhood of special points, the

second-order diﬀerential equation for the eigenfunction can be reduced to the conﬂuent

hypergeometric equation. Then is shown that all well-behaved eigenfunctions for that class

of systems are expressed in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials. Exactly solvable

problems in this category include all the potentials mentioned in the ﬁrst paragraph and the

exactly soluble generalized Morse potential is used as an illustration.

II. LAPLACE TRANSFORM AND A FEW OF ITS PROPERTIES

Let us begin with a brief description of the Laplace transform and a few of its properties

[69]. The Laplace transform of a function Φ is deﬁned by

F (s) = L {Φ} =Z ∞

0

dξ e−sξΦ (ξ) .

(1)

If there is some positive constant σ such that Φ does not increase faster than eσξ for suf-

ﬁciently large ξ then Φ is said to be of exponential order σ. In this case, the integral in

Equation (1) may exist for Re s > σ. Nevertheless, the Laplace transform may fail to exist
because of a suﬃciently strong singularity in the function Φ as ξ → 0. In particular, ξλ is
of exponential order arbitrary and

L(cid:26)

ξλ

Γ (λ + 1)(cid:27) =

1
sλ+1 , Re λ > −1, Re s > 0,

(2)

where Γ is the gamma function. Derivative properties involving the Laplace transform

are convenient for solving diﬀerential equations.

In this paper we shall use the following

properties:

dξ(cid:27) = sF (s) − Φ|ξ=0
L(cid:26)dΦ

More than this, we shall use a pair of relations mapping limiting forms. If near an isolated

singular point s0 the Laplace transform behaves as

III. THE GENERALIZED MORSE POTENTIAL

(4)

(5)

(6)

The time-independent Schr¨odinger equation is an eigenvalue equation for the character-
istic pair (E, ψ) with E ∈ R. For a particle of mass m embedded in the generalized Morse
potential it reads

d2ψ (x)
dx2 +

2m

2 (cid:0)E − V1e−αx − V2e−2αx(cid:1) ψ (x) = 0,

On account of the normalization condition, R ∞

like ξS as |ξ| → 0 and like e−ξ/2 as |ξ| → ∞ with ξ ∈ R (V2 > 0) and S > 0 (E < 0). The

dξ2 + (b − ξ)

dΦ (ξ)
dξ − a Φ (ξ) = 0,

(12)

with b = 2S +1 > 1. Eq. (12) is the standard form of the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation

[70]. Notice that Φ is a nonzero constant at the origin and tends to inﬁnity no more rapidly

than exp (σ1ξσ2), with σ2 < 1 and arbitrary σ1, for suﬃciently large ξ. This occurs because
σ1ξσ2 − ξ/2 → −ξ/2 as ξ → ∞. The regular behaviour of Φ at the origin plus its behaviour
for large ξ ensure the existence of its Laplace transform. In this case Φ is of exponential

order arbitrary and consequently its Laplace transform exists for Re s > 0.

IV. LAPLACE TRANSFORM OF THE CONFLUENT HYPERGEOMETRIC EQUA-

TION

Using the derivative properties of the Laplace transforms given by (3), the conﬂuent

hypergeometric equation is mapped onto

s (s − 1)

dF (s)

ds

+ [(2 − b) s + a − 1] F (s) = (1 − b) Φ (0) , Re s > 0.

(13)

Note that this ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation has regular (nonessential) singularities at s = 0

and s = 1. Therefore, F (s) is either analytical, or possess a pole or branch point, at the

regular singular point (Fuchs theorem). The relation connecting the behaviour of F near an

isolated singular point and the behaviour of Φ for large ξ dictates that Φ behaves like ξν−1

or ξν−1eξ, depending on where the isolated singularity of F is, whether near s = 0 or s = 1,

respectively. Due to the asymptotic behaviour prescribed for Φ at the end of the previous
section, one sees that F behaves like s−ν as s → 0, and (13) enforces

ν = 1 − a.

(14)

On the other hand, using the initial value theorem one sees that F behaves like Φ (0) /s
as s → ∞. Thus, we seek a particular solution of (13), regular at s = 1, in the form of a
polynomial in inverse powers of s:

F (s) =

(15)

with c0 6= 0 and

ν = n + 1,

(16)

in such a way that s = 0 is a pole of order n + 1 and F (s) is the principal part of a ﬁnite

Laurent series with residue cn = Φ (0) at s = 0. Comparing (14) with (16), one sees that

Substituting (15) into (13) one obtains the following two-term recursive relation for the

(21)

(22)

(23)

Actually, condition (17) transforms the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation into generalized

Laguerre’s equation in such a way that the succeeding process involving the inversion of the

Laplace transform is not surprising.

For systems whose eigenfunctions can be expressed in terms of a particular solution of the

conﬂuent hypergeometric equation, Eqs. (17) and (23) summarize all we need to determine

the complete set of bound-state solutions.

V. BOUND STATES IN A GENERALIZED MORSE POTENTIAL

We now turn our attention to the generalized Morse potential. Substitution of (17) into

(9) leads to the quantization condition

n + S +

mV1

α√2mV2

.

(24)

Hence, V1 < 0 so that the generalized Morse potential is able to hold bound states only if it

has a well structure (V1 < 0 and V2 > 0). Furthermore, because E < 0 one gets

n <

m|V1|

α√2mV2 −

.

(25)

This restriction on n limits the number of allowed states and requires m|V1|/(cid:0)α√2mV2(cid:1) >

1/2 to make the existence of a bound state possible. Finally, we use the quantization

condition (24) to write

En = −

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Bessel’s equation as well as diﬀerential equations with linear coeﬃcients can be mapped

onto simpler homogeneous ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations for the Laplace transform when

the original functions are subject to special boundary conditions at the origin (see, e.g. [69]).

Following the spiced Engleﬁeld’s recipe, we have shown that the bound-state solutions of the

Schr¨odinger equation whose eigenfunctions are expressed in terms of particular solutions of

the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation, including the large class of systems with potentials

relevant to atomic and molecular physics such as the generalized Morse, singular harmonic

oscillator, and singular Coulomb potentials, beyond the ring-shaped potentials approached

in Ref. [67], can be obtained by using the Laplace transform of the conﬂuent hypergeometric

equation. In those cases, the Laplace transform maps the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation

onto a nonhomogeneous ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation. The source of nonhomogeneity

is just the particular solution of the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation at the origin but

this fact does not represent a less favourable position because it is related asymptotically

to the residue of the Laplace transform at the origin via the initial value theorem.

It

is worthwhile recall that the eigenfunction for the generalized Morse potential does not

have values prescribed at the origin. The spiced Engleﬁeld’s recipe allows searching for a

particular solution of the transformed equation with a well-deﬁned singularity and a well-

deﬁned asymptotic behaviour, and such as presented in this paper the exact-closed form of

the Laplace transform does not have relevance to determinate the complete set of bound-

state solutions.
