BALLISTIC TRANSPORT FOR LIMIT-PERIODIC JACOBI MATRICES

WITH APPLICATIONS TO QUANTUM MANY-BODY PROBLEMS

JAKE FILLMAN

Abstract. We study Jacobi matrices that are uniformly approximated by periodic op-
erators. We show that if the rate of approximation is suﬃciently rapid, then the associ-
ated quantum dynamics are ballistic in a rather strong sense; namely, the (normalized)
Heisenberg evolution of the position operator converges strongly to a self-adjoint op-
erator that is injective on the space of absolutely summable sequences. In particular,
this means that all transport exponents corresponding to well-localized initial states are
equal to one. Our result may be applied to a class of quantum many-body problems.
Speciﬁcally, we establish a lower bound on the Lieb–Robinson velocity for an isotropic
XY spin chain on the integers with limit-periodic couplings.

1. Introduction

1.1. Limit-Periodic Jacobi Matrices. We will study the quantum dynamical charac-
teristics of limit-periodic Jacobi matrices in the regime of absolutely continuous spectrum.
By a Jacobi matrix, we mean a bounded self-adjoint operator J = Ja,b : ℓ2(Z) → ℓ2(Z)
deﬁned by

(Jϕ)n = an−1ϕn−1 + bnϕn + anϕn+1, n ∈ Z, ϕ ∈ ℓ2(Z),

(1.1)
where a, b ∈ ℓ∞(Z, R) and infn an > 0. In the present paper, our goal is to understand the
associated quantum dynamics; that is to say, we want to probe asymptotic characteristics
of solutions to the corresponding time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation:

(1.2)

i

∂ψ
∂t

= Jψ, ψ(0) = ϕ0 ∈ ℓ2(Z).

Using the spectral theorem, one may explicitly solve (1.2) via

ψ(t) = e−itJϕ0,

t ∈ R.

If there exists q ∈ Z+ for which an+q = an and bn+q = bn for all n ∈ Z, we say that J is q-
periodic, and it is known that the dynamics described by the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation (1.2) are ballistic in a very strong sense [17]. Concretely, there exists a bounded
self-adjoint operator Q = QJ such that ker(QJ) = {0} and

(1.3)

t

XJ(t) = QJ,

where XJ(t) denotes the Heisenberg evolution of the position operator relative to J, i.e.,

XJ(t)

def
= eitJXe−itJ,

t ∈ R.

The position operator is an (unbounded) self-adjoint operator deﬁned by

(Xϕ)n

def= nϕn, n ∈ Z, ϕ ∈ D(X) def= (ϕ ∈ ℓ2(Z) : kXϕk2 = Xn∈Z

|nϕn|2 < ∞) .

A particular consequence of (1.3) is that all of the moments of the position operator grow
ballistically in time whenever J is periodic. More speciﬁcally, for p > 0 and ϕ ∈ ℓ2(Z),
deﬁne

|X|p

ϕ(t)

(|n|p + 1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

When considering such objects, we want to avoid trivialities that arise due to the diver-
gence of moments, so we will restrict attention to states that are well-localized in the sense
that they belong to the discrete Schwartz space

S = S(Z) def= (ϕ ∈ ℓ2(Z) : Xn∈Z

|n|p|ϕn| < ∞ for all p > 0) .

Thus, given ϕ ∈ S, we want to measure the growth of |X|p
so it makes sense to deﬁne

ϕ in time on a polynomial scale,

β+
ϕ (p)

def
= lim sup

t→∞

ϕ(t)

log |X|p
p log t

,

β−
ϕ (p)

def
= lim inf
t→∞

ϕ(t)

log |X|p
p log t

.

The equation (1.3) (together with injectivity of QJ) immediately implies that β+
β−
ϕ (p) = 1 for all p > 0 and all ϕ ∈ S.
There is substantial interest in determining estimates and exact values for these trans-
port exponents in aperiodic lattice models. In general, one may probe solutions of (1.2)
by analyzing the spectral measures of J, deﬁned by

ϕ (p) =

f (E) dµϕ(E) = hϕ, f (J)ϕi, ϕ ∈ ℓ2(Z), f ∈ Cc(R).

ZR

If ϕ ∈ S is a state such that the associated spectral measure µϕ is absolutely continuous
with respect to Lebesgue measure, then one immediately has what has been termed quasi–
ballistic motion in the literature. Speciﬁcally, one has β+
ϕ (p) = 1 for all p > 0 [26].
However, this approach to quantum dynamics has limitations; for example, it is not clear
whether absolute continuity can preclude β−
ϕ (p) < 1 for some p > 0, i.e., sub-ballistic
transport on a subsequence of time scales. For a related characterization of the relationship
between absolutely continuous spectrum and transport in terms of Thouless transport and
Landauer–B¨uttiker conductance, see [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

As another step towards answering the general question, it is therefore interesting to
pursue special cases in which one knows that the Jacobi matrix enjoys purely absolutely
continuous spectrum, and in which one has access to more specialized tools than are
present in the general setting. Within the last year, several preprints have appeared
that prove ballistic transport for several classes of quasi-periodic operators with purely
absolutely continuous spectrum [23, 37, 38]. An intriguing special case of Jacobi matrices
with purely a.c. spectrum is furnished by limit-periodic operators that are approximated
by periodic Jacobi matrices exponentially quickly.

Deﬁnition. A Jacobi matrix J is said to be limit-periodic if there exists a sequence
{Jn}∞

n=1 consisting of periodic Jacobi matrices such that

lim
n→∞

kJ − Jnk = 0.

Such operators (and their continuum counterparts) were studied heavily in the 1980’s; see,
for instance, [3, 11, 18, 29, 32, 33, 34]. In recent years, a substantial amount of progress
has been made in the study of spectral characteristics of such operators [2, 13, 14, 15,
16, 19, 20, 21, 22], as well as their unitary analogs, CMV matrices with limit-periodic
Verblunsky coeﬃcients [31]. However, outside the results of [17], relatively little is known
regarding the quantum dynamics of limit-periodic Jacobi matrices.

BALLISTIC TRANSPORT FOR LIMIT-PERIODIC JACOBI MATRICES

Given η > 0, we say that a limit-periodic Jacobi matrix J is of exponential class η
(denoted J ∈ EC(η)) if there exists a sequence of qn-periodic Jacobi matrices Jn such that

lim
n→∞

eηqn+1 kJ − Jnk = 0,

qn|qn+1, and qn 6= qn+1 for all n. We say that J ∈ EC(∞) if it is of exponential class
η for all η > 0 [11, 18, 32, 33]. Recall that we have adopted the standing assumption
inf n an > 0.

If J ∈ EC(∞), it is known that J has purely absolutely continuous spectrum [18], that
its spectrum is homogeneous in the sense of Carleson [20], and that J is reﬂectionless
thereupon [18]. In this paper, we prove that the dynamics associated to such a Jacobi
matrix are ballistic in the sense of (1.3).

Throughout the paper, there will be various estimates that can be controlled as long
as one has a uniform bound on the coeﬃcients of J. To that end, for every R > 0, let
us denote by J (R) the set of operators of the form J = Ja,b deﬁned by (1.1) such that
kJk ≤ R and inf n an ≥ R−1.

Our main result is an extension of [17, Theorem 1.6] to operators in EC(η) with η

suﬃciently large.

Theorem 1.1. For every R > 0, there is a constant η0 = η0(R) with the following
property. If J ∈ EC(η0) and J ∈ J (R), then the dynamics arising from (1.2) are ballistic
in the sense that there exists a self-adjoint operator QJ such that

s-lim
t→∞

1
t

XJ(t) = QJ

and ker(QJ) ∩ ℓ1(Z) = {0}. In particular, β±

ϕ (p) = 1 for all ϕ ∈ S and all p > 0.

Corollary 1.2. If J ∈ EC(∞), then the associated quantum dynamics are ballistic in the
sense of Theorem 1.1.

Remark 1.3. A few remarks regarding Theorem 1.1 are in order:

(1) To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 1.1 supplies the ﬁrst explicit examples of

aperiodic Jacobi matrices for which

1

lim
t→∞

t (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

Xe−itJϕ(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

∈ (0, ∞) for all ϕ ∈ S.

Speciﬁcally, Kachkovskiy’s and Zhang–Zhao’s examples are only known to satisfy
lim sup t−1kXe−itJϕk > 0 and lim inf t−1kXe−itJϕk > 0, respectively [23, 37].

(2) One may be tempted to think that limit-periodic Jacobi matrices share many char-
acteristics with periodic Jacobi matrices, and that one can prove such statements
by “pushing” spectral and dynamical characteristics through to the limit using
uniform convergence. However, one cannot do this in general; indeed, the spectral
and quantum dynamical characteristics of limit-periodic operators are, generically,
vastly distinct from those of periodic operators. For example:

• Limit-periodic Schr¨odinger operators (an ≡ 1) generically exhibit purely sin-
gular continuous spectrum on a Cantor set of zero Lebesgue measure and
may even possess purely singular continuous spectrum with zero Hausdorﬀ
dimension and positive Lyapunov exponents [2].

• There is a dense subset of the space of all limit-periodic Schr¨odinger operators
upon which the spectral type is pure point [16]; moreover, the eigenfunctions
of such limit-periodic operators may exhibit Anderson localization in a re-
markably strong sense [14, 34].

4

J. FILLMAN

• A limit-periodic operator may have an integrated density of states that enjoys

no positive H¨older modulus of continuity [22].

• There is a dense set of limit-periodic operators for which one has β−
δ0

(p) = 0

for all p > 0 [17].

(3) Theorem 1.1 is a discrete, one-dimensional counterpart to [24, Theorem 1.2]. How-
ever, the techniques of proof are distinct, and the conclusion in the one-dimensional
setting is stronger; concretely, we obtain ballistic growth of all moments with-
out time-averaging and for all initial states with suﬃciently rapid decay at ±∞,
whereas [24] proves ballistic growth of the time-averaged second moment for a
restricted class of initial states.

(4) One can prove a result for limit-periodic CMV matrices that is analogous to Theo-
rem 1.1 via very simple modiﬁciations of the proof. In this setting, one considers a
(two-sided) CMV matrix C whose Verblunsky coeﬃcients are bounded away from
the unit circle and are exponentially well approximated by periodic sequences, and
one evolves the position operator via

XC(ℓ) = C−ℓXCℓ,

ℓ ∈ Z.

In particular, one may substitute [12, Section 9] for [17, Section 2], and the proof
that

QC = s-lim
ℓ→∞

1
ℓ

XC(ℓ)

exists and has the desired properties is essentially unchanged. In fact, a few es-
timates are simpler, since Cℓ is a ﬁnite-range operator for all ℓ ∈ Z. Using the
Cantero–Gr¨unbaum–Moral–Vel´azquez connection [9, 10], one may make a corre-
sponding statement for one-dimensional coined quantum walks.
In particular,
this permits one to extend the result of [1, Theorem 4] to 1D coined quantum
walks that are uniformly approximated by translation-invariant quantum walks
suﬃciently rapidly; namely, such quantum walks exhibit ballistic transport in the
sense of (1.3).

1.2. Quantum Spin Systems. Our result may be applied to a class of quantum spin
systems with limit-periodic coupling coeﬃcients to deduce lower bounds on the Lieb–
Robinson velocity.

Concretely, one may deﬁne the isotropic XY spin chain as follows. For each interval

Λ = [m, n] ∩ Z, deﬁne the state space

Given S ⊆ Λ, we deﬁne the algebra of observables on S by

2×2, acting on the jth coordinate of the tensor product. Given a matrix

Given sequences {µj}j∈Z

For such models, one has the celebrated Lieb–Robinson bound on the rate at which
correlations may propagate. Here, and in what follows, [·, ·] denotes the commutator

[S, T ]

def
= ST − T S.

Theorem 1.4 (Lieb–Robinson [27], Nachtergaele–Sims [30]). For any subinterval Λ =
[m, n] ∩ Z, any disjoint S1, S2 ⊆ Λ, any A ∈ AS1, B ∈ AS2 and all t ∈ R,

(1.4)

where τ Λ

t denotes the associated Heisenberg evolution on AΛ with respect to HΛ:

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:2)τ Λ
t (A), B(cid:3)(cid:13)(cid:13) ≤ C kAk kBk e−c(d−v|t|),

τ Λ
t (A)

def
= eitHΛ Ae−itHΛ ,

t ∈ R.

In (1.4), c, v > 0 are uniform constants, C > 0 is a constant that depends solely on S1
and S2, and d denotes the minimal separation between S1 and S2:

d = min {|n1 − n2| : n1 ∈ S1, n2 ∈ S2} .

Theorem 1.1 allows us to deduce ballistic spreading for an isotropic XY chain with
limit-periodic couplings that are suﬃciently rapidly approximated by periodic sequences.
Since the Lieb–Robinson bound is (by its very nature) an upper bound, by a lower bound
on the Lieb–Robinson velocity, we mean that there exists v0 such that if a bound of the
form (1.4) holds with some constants C, c, v > 0, then one must have v ≥ v0.

Theorem 1.5. Suppose µ = {µj} and ν = {νj} are given with infj µj > 0. There is a
constant η0 > 0 that depends only on kµk∞, kµ−1k∞, and kνk∞ such that if there exist
qn-periodic sequences µ(n), ν(n) ∈ ℓ∞(Z) with

lim
n→∞

eη0qn+1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

µ − µ(n)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)∞

= lim
n→∞

eη0qn+1(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

ν − ν(n)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)∞

= 0

then there exists v0 > 0 such that if a Lieb–Robinson bound of the form (1.4) holds for
some constants C, c, v > 0, then v ≥ v0.

Proof. This follows immediately from the arguments that prove [17, Theorem 1.3] by using
the Jordan–Wigner transform to reduce to a free Fermion system [28]. More speciﬁcally,
the statement of the theorem follows from Theorem 1.1 and [23, Theorem 6.1]. There are
two minor technicalities. We allow {µj} to be nonconstant, and we only have ker(Q) ∩
ℓ1(Z) = {0}. However, it is straightforward to check that Kachkovskiy’s proof works
equally well in this setting.
(cid:3)

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we prove quantitative estimates
on the rate at which the left-hand side of (1.3) converges to the right hand side. It is quite
easy to see that naive estimates in the generic situation (all spectral gaps opens) yield a
convergence rate proportional to t−1. However, the constant of proportionality depends
on the length of the smallest gap, and the naive estimates completely break when a gap
degenerates; moreover, it is diﬃcult to divine the length of the smallest gap from coeﬃcient

6

J. FILLMAN

data alone, so we must work harder to prove convergence estimates that ignore gap lengths.
We apply this analysis in Section 3 to prove Theorem 1.1. Appendix A contains a general
estimate to the eﬀect that Heisenberg evolutions of the position operator with respect to
diﬀerent Jacobi matrices may diverge from one another at most quadratically in time.
This is certainly well-known and not new, but we could not ﬁnd a reference that stated
the desired bounds in the necessary form, so we opted to present proofs to keep the paper
self-contained.

2. Convergence Rate

The main result of this section controls the rate at which the left-hand side of (1.3)
converges to the right-hand side. In order to accomplish this, we will need to brieﬂy recall
some notions from Floquet Theory; for proofs and further details, the interested reader is
referred to the excellent references [35, Chapter 5] and [36, Chapter 7]. Throughout the

invariant probability measure, which we denote by Leb, i.e.,

Jθ has simple spectrum whenever θ 6= 0, π. We may conjugate J to the direct integral of
{Jθ}θ∈T

For our purposes, the key calculation from [17] identiﬁes FqQF ∗

by decomposing Aθ in an eigenbasis of Jθ. More precisely, let θ 7→ ~vj(θ), 1 ≤ j ≤ q be a
q such that {~vj(θ) : 1 ≤ j ≤ q} is an orthonormal basis

Jθ~vj(θ) = λj(θ)~vj(θ),

for all 1 ≤ j ≤ q, θ ∈ T,

and such that ~vj is smooth on the arcs (0, π) and (π, 2π). Next, let Pj(θ) denote projection
onto the corresponding eigenspace: ker(Jθ −λj(θ)). Then, the matrix elements of Qθ with

where C1 = C1(R) denotes the constant from Theorem 2.1 and kϕk1 denotes the ℓ1 norm

Proof. We know that D(X(t)) = D(X) for all t and

eisJAe−isJ ds

as operators on D(X) [17]. Notice that D(X) ⊆ ℓ1(Z) and that

kFqϕ(θ)kC

q ≤ kϕk1 for every θ ∈ T.

Thus, comparing (2.5), (2.6), and (2.7), we see that the statement of the corollary follows
immediately from Theorem 2.1.
(cid:3)

In view of (2.3), if θ ∈ T is such that λj(θ)−λk(θ) is not too small, then we can perform
the ds integral in the third line and obtain good control over the rate of convergence. Thus,
the main obstacle in the proof of Theorem 2.1 is to bound the size of the set of “bad” θ’s at
which λj and λk may be close. However, since θ can be viewed as a rotation number, one
is essentially asking for estimates on the density of states measure of small neighborhoods
of band edges of J.

Deﬁnition. Since it is important in what follows, let us brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of the
density of states measure k = kJ of a periodic Jacobi matrix J. For each n ≥ 2, let us
consider the restriction of J to ℓ2([1, n] ∩ Z) with Dirichlet boundary conditions, that is,

It is known the the density of states measure of a periodic Jacobi matrix has square-root
divergence at the band edges, and thus, the measure of the set of θ ∈ T at which one
may have |λj(θ) − λk(θ)| ≤ δ scales like δ1/2 as δ ↓ 0. However, this estimate is far too
crude for our current purposes, since we need to control the scaling behavior of the D.O.S.
across a family of Jacobi matrices with growing period, and hence, we need some measure
of control on the implicit scaling constant; the following lemma supplies the necessary
reﬁnement.

Proof. This is essentially [25, Equation (3.10)]. Last works with discrete Schr¨odinger
operators, for which the oﬀ-diagonal elements obey an ≡ 1. However, it is a straightfor-
ward exercise to adapt his proof to the Jacobi setting and deduce the statement of the
lemma.
(cid:3)

Proof of Lemma 2.3. The main idea is to use explicit expressions for the (derivative of)
the integrated density of states together with exponential lower bounds on band lengths
to control the scaling constant. More speciﬁcally, k is absolutely continuous with respect
to Lebesgue measure, and [35, Corollary 5.4.20] identiﬁes its Radon-Nikodym derivative

and xj denotes the jth zero of the derivative of the discriminant of J (which is known to

slightly from the expression in [35], in that we phrase the products in terms of the period,
q, rather than ℓ, the number of open gaps in the spectrum. Of course, if the jth gap
collapses, one has βj = xj = αj+1, so one obtains the expression from [35] by cancelling
any term of the form

|E − xj|

whenever j corresponds to a closed gap. Using (2.8), it is easy to see that whenever

so it remains to bound the Lebesgue measure of Bt. Since θ may be viewed as a ro-

BALLISTIC TRANSPORT FOR LIMIT-PERIODIC JACOBI MATRICES

11

3. Proof of Ballistic Transport

We now have all the ingredients necessary to prove Theorem 1.1. The overall strategy is
as follows: given J ∈ EC(η) with η suﬃciently large, let {Jn}∞
n=1 be a sequence of periodic
operators that converges exponentially quickly to J in operator norm. For each n, there
is a bounded self-adjoint operator

Qn

def= s-lim
t→∞

1
t

XJn(t).

We begin by showing that {Qn}∞
n=1 is a strongly Cauchy sequence of bounded oper-
ators, and hence has a limit Q = s-limn Qn, which serves as a natural candidate for
s-limt→∞ t−1XJ(t). The estimates from the previous section and Appendix A ensure that
we may choose a sequence of times scales so that on the nth time scale, XJ is close to XJn
and XJn is close to Qn, thus enabling the interchange of n and t limits.

Dealing with the kernel of Q is slightly more delicate. For ϕ ∈ ℓ1(Z) \ {0}, we show
that Qnϕ converges to Qϕ faster than kQnϕk can decay to zero, which forces Qϕ 6= 0.
The precise details follow.

Proof of Theorem 1.1. Let R be given, and let J ∈ J (R) ∩ EC(η0), where η0 is suﬃciently
large. As the argument progresses, it will be easy to see that η0 only depends on R and
that it will only increase ﬁnitely many times over the course of the argument. A bit more
concretely, ﬁx a constant κ > 10, and put R

def
= supk kJkk. It then suﬃces to take

η0 > 2κ log(C0),

where C0 = max(6, R + 2, C1, C3), C1 = C1(R) from Theorem 2.1, and C3 = C3(R) from
Lemma 2.4.

Existence of Q. First, let us show that there exists a bounded operator Q such that
Qn → Q in the strong operator topology. Since the family {Qn}∞
n=1 is uniformly bounded
(indeed, kQnk ≤ 2R for all n), it suﬃces to prove that

both of which are clearly summable by our choice of tn and κ. Next, by using Theorem A.1
and C0 ≥ R + 2, we obtain

which is summable by our choice of tn and η0. Combining these three summability state-
ments, we obtain (3.1) for all ϕ ∈ ℓ1(Z). Since kQnk ≤ 2R and Q∗
n = Qn for all n ∈ Z+,
it follows that Qn converges strongly to a bounded self-adjoint operator Q on ℓ2(Z).

Appendix A. General Propagation Estimates

In the appendix, we prove a simple upper bound on the rate at which the Heisenberg
evolution of the position operator diverges with respect to diﬀerent local Hamiltonians
given by Jacobi matrices. This material is classical and well-known; it is presented here
for the convenience of the reader and to make the paper more self-contained.

Theorem A.1. If J, J′ ∈ J (R) for some R > 0, then

(A.1)

The following lemma will be helpful.

kXJ(t) − XJ′(t)k ≤(cid:0)Rt2 + 2|t|(cid:1)kJ − J′k

for all t ∈ R.

Lemma A.2. Let A and B denote bounded self-adjoint operators on a separable Hilbert
space H. For all t ∈ R, one has the estimate

Proof. Let us deﬁne G(t) = I − e−itAeitB for t ∈ R. One may readily verify that G is a
diﬀerentiable function from R into the space of bounded linear operators on H, and that

(cid:13)(cid:13)eitA − eitB(cid:13)(cid:13) ≤ |t|kA − Bk.

Consequently, kG′(t)k = kA − Bk for all t. Since G(0) = 0, we know that

−iG′(t) = e−itA(A − B)eitB.

G(t) =Z t

G′(s) ds,

14

and hence kG(t)k ≤ |t|kA − Bk for all t. Since eitA is unitary for every t ∈ R, we have

keitA − eitBk = kI − e−itAeitBk = kG(t)k ≤ |t|kA − Bk,

as desired.

(cid:3)

Proof of Theorem A.1. Let J, J′ ∈ J (R) and ϕ ∈ D(X) with kϕk = 1 be given; deﬁne
Fϕ : R → ℓ2(Z) by

Fϕ(t) = XJ(t)ϕ − XJ′(t)ϕ.

It is easy to see that Fϕ is a diﬀerentiable function with Fϕ(0) = 0, and that one has

−iF ′
Thus, we can estimate kF ′

ϕ(t) = eitJ[J, X]e−itJϕ − eitJ′
ϕ(t)k from above as follows:
ϕ(t)k ≤ keitJ[J, X]e−itJϕ − eitJ′

[J, X]e−itJϕ − eitJ′
[J′, X]e−itJϕ − eitJ′

[J′, X]e−itJϕk
[J′, X]e−itJ′

ϕk.

We can bound the ﬁrst and third terms from above using Lemma A.2:

keitJ[J, X]e−itJϕ − eitJ′
[J′, X]e−itJϕ − eitJ′

[J, X]e−itJϕk ≤ |t|kJ − J′kk[J, X]k ≤ R|t|kJ − J′k
[J′, X]e−itJ′
ϕk ≤ |t|kJ − J′kk[J′, X]k ≤ R|t|kJ − J′k.

keitJ′

Next, we turn to the middle term on the right hand side of (A.2); by unitarity of eitJ and
eitJ′

, it is equal to k[J, X] − [J′, X]k, which may be bounded above via

k[J, X] − [J′, X]k ≤ 2kJ − J′k.

Combining these three estimates and using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we have

kFϕ(t)k ≤ (Rt2 + 2|t|)kJ − J′k for all t ∈ R.
Since D(X) is dense in ℓ2(Z), the statement of the theorem follows.
