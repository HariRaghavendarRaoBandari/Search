In this letter we demonstrate the importance of including the lensing contribution in galaxy
clustering analyses with large galaxy redshift surveys. It is well known that radial cross-correlations
between diﬀerent redshift bins of galaxy surveys are dominated by lensing. But we show here that
also neglecting lensing in the auto-correlations within one bin severely biases cosmological parameter
estimation with redshift surveys. It leads to signiﬁcant shifts for several cosmological parameters,
most notably the scalar amplitude, the scalar spectral index and in particular the neutrino mass
scale. Especially the latter parameter is one of the main targets of future galaxy surveys.

Introduction: Galaxy number counts are a key ob-
servable in cosmology and are exploited by current [1–
3] and future [4–7] cosmological observations. Usually
the galaxy counts are compared to the predicted power
spectrum of matter density ﬂuctuations P (k, z), which is
however not directly observable. The power spectrum in
harmonic space C(cid:96)(z, z(cid:48)) on the other hand is an observ-
able [8].

Predictions for number counts have been derived for
example in [8–10]. From these expressions it becomes
clear that, in addition to the well known density perturb-
ations and redshift space distortions that are usually in-
cluded in P (k), there are additional, so called relativistic
eﬀects, that contribute to the observed number counts.
They come from the fact that we observe photons which
have been deﬂected on their way from a source into the
telescopes and that not only the galaxy number, but also
the volume is perturbed. For typical surveys, the most
important relativistic eﬀect is due to lensing convergence
[11, 12]. In this letter we show that neglecting lensing
convergence in the analysis of a future survey like Eu-
clid will lead to signiﬁcant biases in the estimation of
cosmological parameters. As a consequence, care should
be taken to include lensing.
Including it in the stand-
ard matter power spectrum P (k) is diﬃcult as lensing
inherently mixes diﬀerent scales; this argues in favor of
the adoption of quantities like the C(cid:96)(z, z(cid:48)) where it is
straightforward to include relativistic eﬀects.

Methodology: We illustrate the bias by analysing
C(cid:96)(z, z(cid:48)). We employ CLASSgal [13] to compute ‘ob-
served’ C(cid:96) that include the eﬀect of lensing convergence
in addition to the matter perturbations and to redshift
space distortions, and ‘theory’ C(cid:96) that only contain the
latter two and neglect lensing. We call the former C obs
(cid:96) . In order to mimic a P (k) analysis
and the latter C th
more closely, we consider not only the full set of C(cid:96)(z, z(cid:48))
but add a case where we limit ourselves to the auto-
correlations C(cid:96)(z, z).

The survey conﬁguration which we consider here is
consistent with the Euclid photometric catalog. The

(cid:96)

number of galaxies per redshift and per steradian, the
galaxy density, the galaxy bias and the magniﬁcation
bias are as speciﬁed in Appendix A of Ref. [14]; we
adopt a covered sky fraction fsky = 0.364 and divide
the catalog into Nbin = 5 Gaussian redshift bins con-
taining equal numbers of galaxies, N = 109/5. We as-
sume a ﬁducial ﬂat ΛCDM model consistent with Planck
[15],
including massive neutrinos with a normal mass
hierarchy (dominated by the heaviest neutrino mass ei-
genstate). The cosmological parameters of our ﬁdu-
cial model are the reduced baryon density parameter,
h2Ωb = ωb = 2.225 × 10−2, the cold dark matter density
parameter, h2Ωcdm = ωcdm = 0.1198, the scalar spec-
index, ns = 0.9645, the amplitude of curvature
tral
ﬂuctuations,
ln 1010As = 3.094, the Hubble constant
H0 = 67.27km/s/Mpc = h100km/s/Mpc, and the sum

of the neutrino masses,(cid:80) mν = 0.06 eV.

We incorporate an error Eij

(cid:96) due to non-linearities com-
puted as a re-scaling of the transfer functions based on
the Halofit corrections to the power spectrum (see Ap-
pendix D of [14] for details; we neglect the parameter
dependence of the error Eij
(cid:96) ). We also add a shot-noise
contribution N −1 to the power spectra. Thus, the an-
gular power spectrum of number count ﬂuctuations is
modelled as

(cid:96) + N −1δij,

C A,ij
(cid:96) = C ij

(1)
where A = obs, th and i, j = 1, ..., Nbin are redshift bin
indices.

(cid:96) + Eij

Similarly to the cosmic shear implementation of [16],
we adopt a Gaussian likelihood which leads to a χ2 rel-
ative to the ﬁducial model given by

can be found in [16]. To be conservative and keep non-
linear eﬀects small, we choose (cid:96)max = 400 in the analysis.
Angular power spectra C(cid:96) and non-linear corrections
E(cid:96) are accurately computed using the Limber approxim-
ation only for the lensing integral along the line-of-sight.
We then explore the parameter space with the help of a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach [17] using
ﬂat priors, but neglecting lensing convergence when com-
(cid:96) with which we want
puting the theoretical spectra C th
to ﬁt the observed C(cid:96). To speed up the MCMC explora-
tion of parameter space, the C(cid:96) of the theoretical spectra
are computed less accurately than C obs
, but we request
that ∆χ2 (cid:46) 0.2 for the ﬁducial parameters when lensing
is included in the analysis. Hence the inaccuracy in our
calculations can lead to an uncertainty of the order of
∆χ2 (cid:46) 0.2.

Results: We have ﬁtted the generated C ij

(cid:96) data in
three diﬀerent ways, where lensing convergence is: i) con-
sistently included, ii) neglected, iii) neglected and only
redshift bin auto-correlations are taken into account. The

2

results are shown in Table I and Figure 1. Fig. 1 shows 2D
contours and 1D probability distribution functions for the
marginalized posteriors of the cosmological parameters
obtained from these analyses. The red contours show the
full analysis. They should reproduce the ﬁducial model.
In the analyses shown by the gray and blue contours lens-
ing is neglected. Furthermore, in the gray contours only
auto-correlations (i.e. C(cid:96)(z, z)) are analyzed, while the
blue contours use both auto- and cross-correlations (i.e.
C(cid:96)(z, z(cid:48)) for all combinations of redshift bins). The auto-
correlation case is closer to the standard P (k) analysis
which is usually performed in redshift bins, but caution
should be taken in comparing the two analyses since bin-
ning in redshift has signiﬁcantly diﬀerent eﬀects.

From the red contours in Fig. 1 it is evident that we
cannot determine the baryon and cold dark matter dens-
ities very well with our conﬁguration. The rather large
redshift bins of our analysis with ∆z (cid:38) 0.3 signiﬁcantly
smear out the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO’s), leav-
ing only the dominant features in the power spectrum
which are ﬁxed by the equality scale, keq ∝ ωm/H0 (at
ﬁxed radiation content and measured in h/Mpc) and the
ratio ωb/ωcdm. This leads to a signiﬁcant degeneracy
between ωb, ωcdm and H0, only the slopes of the (ωx, H0)
and the (ωb, ωcdm) contours are well determined. The
large uncertainties in these parameters, as well as the
prior mν ≥ 0, push the posterior mean value away from
the best ﬁt (which is always very close to the input value),
also for the correct analysis including lensing which shows
a shift in the mean values (cid:54) 1.2σ despite the fact that we
did not add realization noise in our likelihood. But this
is not relevant for the present study. Our aim here is not
to derive optimal parameter constraints, but to demon-
strate the importance of the lensing contribution in such
an analysis. For this reason our approach is far from op-
timal but conservative and simple, and even in this case
we ﬁnd that not including lensing leads to wrong results.
Optimizing error contours by, e.g., introducing more non-
linear scales in the analysis is expected to lead to even
more biased results, given that the relevance of lensing
increases at higher multipoles.

If lensing is neglected in the analysis, several para-
meters show a signiﬁcant bias with respect to the input
parameters (given by the vertical dashed lines) cf. also
Table I. Especially the value of the scalar amplitude As is
increased by 3σ to 6σ. This is due to the fact that lensing
(together with the magniﬁcation bias for Euclid speciﬁc-
ations) increases the total clustering amplitude which is
now compensated with a larger amplitude As. However,
this leads to too much clustering on small scales, which,
in turn, is compensated by reducing the spectral index by
(2 − 4)σ and by increasing the neutrino mass. This also
smears out small scale features in the auto-correlations
as does lensing. The preferred neutrino mass is around
0.4− 0.5 eV, which corresponds just about to the current
limits from cosmology [15]. From the degeneracy direc-

tions in the two-dimensional contours in Fig. 1 we can
also read oﬀ that forcing mν → m(ﬁd)
ν = 0.06 eV would
lead to an even larger bias in the amplitude As and the
scalar spectral index. To go beyond the current state
and derive accurate estimates of the neutrino masses with
galaxy surveys absolutely requires taking lensing into ac-
count.

The shift of best ﬁt parameters due to neglecting re-
lativistic corrections and the change in the ﬁgure of merit
(hence, in particular, neglecting lensing) has been stud-
ied previously, see e.g. [18–21]. However, these previous
works did not include massive neutrinos and they used a
Fisher matrix analysis which gives quantitative estim-
ates for shifts only if these are signiﬁcantly less than
one standard deviation. Hence the results obtained in

MCMC study presented here gives quantitative results
and demonstrates that large biases, exceeding by far 1σ,
are to be expected even for not very ambitious survey spe-
ciﬁcations. For models with additional parameters, the
possibilities to improve the ﬁt by choosing the ‘wrong’
values of the parameters increase and we may see even
larger biases, leading to even stronger spurious detections
of new physics.

It is interesting that taking cross-correlations into ac-
count helps somewhat to reduce the bias on the paramet-
ers. The scalar spectral index and the scalar amplitude
best-ﬁts now show a bias of 1.6σ and 3.4σ respectively,
as compared to 3.7σ and 6.4σ for auto-correlations only,
and the neutrino mass is shifted by 2.1σ compared to
2.7σ, see Table I. But this ‘improvement’ is actually not
real. It comes to a big extent from the fact that cross-
correlations simply cannot be ﬁtted without the lensing
term so that the standard deviations increase signiﬁc-
antly. This is most manifest in the total ∆χ2 which in-
auto (cid:39) 184 for the ﬁve auto-correlation
creases from ∆χ2
(cid:38) 2000 when adding the 10
bins to more than ∆χ2
cross-correlation bins. Giving each bin naively the same
weight we would expect an increase by a factor 3, in-
(cid:38) 11. The increase in the
stead we have ∆χ2
size of the parameter contours appears at ﬁrst counter-
intuitive as including more data improves our knowledge
and therefore should reduce the errors. This simple logic,
however, only applies if the data can actually be ﬁtted by
the model at hand or if the likelihoods are Gaussian. Oth-
erwise, diﬀerent data may prefer diﬀerent model para-
meters and lead to an increase not only in the total ∆χ2
but also in the size of the conﬁdence contours.

We can understand these results by looking at the dif-
ferences in the harmonic power spectra shown in Fig. 2.
The thick red and thin blue lines are the angular spectra
computed at the best ﬁt values shown in Table I for the
consistent case including lensing, and for the one neg-
lecting it, respectively (we include all redshift bin correl-
ations). For the consistent spectra including lensing, we
compute 1-σ error bars at each multipole by assuming,
as for eq. (2), Gaussian spectra (see eq. (2.13) of [14]).
We consider the representative correlations between the
redshift bins (ij) = (11), (55) and (15) . The plot shows
that, when neglecting lensing, the spectrum for the cross-
correlation between redshift bins 1 and 5 lies outside the
1-σ error bars around the ﬁducial spectrum including
lensing. This conﬁrms that the model cannot ﬁt the mock
data.

Conclusions

In this letter we have shown that neg-
lecting lensing convergence leads to large shifts in the
best ﬁt values of cosmological parameters for the data
sets available from future surveys. As in the CMB, where
the lensing of the power spectra is detected at over 10σ
[15], it will become mandatory to include lensing also in
the analysis of galaxy surveys.

Figure 2. The thick red and the thin blue lines correspond
to the spectra at the best-ﬁt values estimated by consistently
including lensing and by neglecting it, respectively. Gaussian
error bars accounting for cosmic variance and shot-noise for
the consistent analysis are shown as gray regions. The indices
for the correlated redshift bins are shown in the legend. The
model neglecting lensing cannot ﬁt the data, especially due
to redshift cross-correlations.

In the case studied here we have seen mainly an in-
crease in the amplitude As and the neutrino mass mν
and a decrease in the spectral index ns when neglecting
lensing. This comes from the fact that the magniﬁcation
bias for the Euclid speciﬁcations is relatively large [14],
so that the density-lensing correlation contributes with
a positive sign in most bins. We however note that the
speciﬁc shifts which we have obtained in our analysis de-
pend on the details of the survey. The main, generic
result is that in order to estimate cosmological paramet-
ers reliably with future galaxy surveys, we have to cor-
rectly include lensing with the measured magniﬁcation
bias function, s(z), deﬁned by

s(z) ≡ ∂ log10 N (z, m < m∗)

∂m∗

,

where m∗ is the limiting magnitude of the survey and
N (z, m) is the galaxy luminosity function in the survey
at redshift z.

The fact that deep galaxy surveys are so sensitive to
lensing, however, is not only a curse but also a blessing. It
means that these surveys will allow us to determine a map
of the lensing potential at diﬀerent redshifts, i.e. perform
‘lensing tomography’ with galaxy clustering. This will be
a very interesting alternative to lensing tomography with
shear measurements proposed, e.g.
in [22]. Both tech-
niques are challenging but they have diﬀerent systematic
errors and allow valuable cross-checks. So clearly both
paths should be pursued.
