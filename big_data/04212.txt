AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS FOR

PSEUDOGROUPS AND FOR DISCRETE METRIC SPACES

TULLIO CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, ROSTISLAV I. GRIGORCHUK,

AND PIERRE DE LA HARPE

Abstract. This is an expostion of various aspects of amenability and paradoxical de-
compositions for groups, group actions and metric spaces. First, we review the formalism
of pseudogroups, which is well adapted to stating the alternative of Tarski, according to
which a pseudogroup without invariant mean gives rise to paradoxical decompositions, and
to deﬁning a Følner condition. Using a Hall-Rado Theorem on matchings in graphs, we
show then for pseudogroups that existence of an invariant mean is equivalent to the Følner
condition; in the case of the pseudogroup of bounded perturbations of the identity on a
locally ﬁnite metric space, these conditions are moreover equivalent to the negation of the
Gromov’s so-called doubling condition, to isoperimetric conditions, to Kesten’s spectral
condition for related simple random walks, and to various other conditions. We deﬁne also
the minimal Tarski number of paradoxical decompositions associated to a non-amenable
group action (an integer ≥ 4), and we indicate numerical estimates (Sections II.4 and
IV.2). The ﬁnal chapter explores for metric spaces the notion of supramenability, due for
groups to Rosenblatt.

I. Introduction

The present exposition shows various aspects of amenability and non-amenability. Our
initial motivation comes from a note on the Banach-Tarski paradox where Deuber, Si-
monovitz and S´os indicate one kind of paradoxical decomposition for metric spaces, in
relation with what they call an “exponential growth” property [DeSS]. Our ﬁrst pur-
pose is to revisit their work which, in our view, relates paradoxical decompositions with
amenability rather than with growth (see in particular Observation 33 below).

For this, we recall in Chapter II the formalism of set-theoretical pseudogroups which is
well adapted to showing the many aspects of amenability: existence of invariant ﬁnitely
additive measures, absence of paradoxical decompositions, existence of Følner sets and
isoperimetric estimates. We also state one version of the basic Tarski alternative: a pseu-
dogroup is either amenable or paradoxical.

In Chapter III, we specialize the discussion to metric spaces and pseudogroups of bounded
perturbations of the identity; metric spaces, there, are locally ﬁnite (except at the very end
of the chapter). On one hand, this is an interesting class, with many examples given by

ﬁnitely generated groups. On the other hand, it provides a convenient setting for proving
Følner characterization as stated in Chapter II. We discuss also the Kesten characterization
in terms of simple random walks.

For a group G which is not amenable, we estimate in Chapter IV the Tarski number
T (G) ∈ {4, 5, . . . ,∞}, which indicates the minimal number of pieces involved in a paradox-
ical decomposition of G. It is known that T (G) = 4 if and only if G has a subgroup which
is free non abelian. We show that one has 5 ≤ T (G) ≤ 34 [respectively 6 ≤ T (G) ≤ 34] for
some torsion-free groups [resp. for some torsion groups] constructed by Ol’shanskii [Ol1],
and 6 ≤ T(cid:0)B(m, n)(cid:1) ≤ 14 for B(m, n) a Burnside group on m ≥ 2 generators of odd
exponent n ≥ 665 [Ady2].
Building upon the seminal 1929 paper by von Neumann [NeuJ], Rosenblatt has deﬁned
for groups a notion of supramenability. He has shown that supramenable groups include
those of subexponential growth, and it is not known whether there are others. In Chapter
V, we investigate supramenability for pseudogroups and for locally ﬁnite metric spaces; in
particular, we describe a simple example of a graph which is both supramenable and of
superexponential growth.

II. Amenable pseudogroups

II.1. Pseudogroups

1. Deﬁnition. In the present set-theoretical context, a pseudogroup G of transformations
of a set X is a set of bijections γ : S → T between subsets S, T of X which satisﬁes the
following conditions (as listed, e.g., in [HS1]):
(i) the identity X → X is in G,
(ii) if γ : S → T is in G, so is the inverse γ−1 : T → S,
(iii) if γ : S → T and δ : T → U are in G, so is their composition δγ : S → U,
(iv) if γ : S → T is in G and if S′ is a subset of S, the restriction γ|S′ : S′ → γ(S′) is in G,
(v) if γ : S → T is a bijection between two subsets S, T of X and if there exists a ﬁnite
partition S = ⊔1≤j≤nSj with γ|Sj in G for j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, then γ is in G (where ⊔
denotes a disjoint union).
Property (v) expresses the fact that G is closed with respect to ﬁnite gluing up; together
with (iv), they express the fact that, for a bijection γ, being in G is in some sense a local
condition.

1This post on arXiv is the published version (Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. 224 (1999), 57–97) with
the following changes: (i) the caution following Deﬁnition 28, (ii) the addition of a missing hypothesis
in Proposition 38 (we are grateful to Volker Diekert for having pointed out this omission to us), (iii) the
updating of some references, and (iv) the correction of a few minor typos.

Moreover, we have collected comments on several items in a new Chapter VI, after the ﬁrst list of

references.

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

3

For γ : S → T in G, we write also α(γ) for the domain S of γ and ω(γ) for its range T .
For “a pseudogroup G of transformations of a set X” , we write shortly “a pseudogroup
(G, X)”, or even “a pseudogroup G”.
2. Examples. (i) Any action of a group G on a set X generates a pseudogroup GG,X. More
precisely, a bijection γ : S → T is in GG,X if there exists a ﬁnite partition S = ⊔1≤j≤nSj
and elements g1, . . . , gn ∈ G such that γ(x) = gj(x) for all x ∈ Sj, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. If there
exists such a γ, the subsets S, T of X are sometimes said to be G-equidecomposable (or
“endlich zerlegungsgleich” in [NeuJ]).

In case G = X acts on itself by left multiplications, we write GG instead of GG,G.
(ii) Piecewise isometries of a metric space X constitute a pseudogroup PiIs(X), gener-
ated (in the obvious way) by the partial isometries between subsets of X. Observe that it
may be much larger than the pseudogroup associated as in the previous example with the
group of isometries of X; see for example the metric space obtained from the real line by
gluing two hairs of diﬀerent length at two distinct points of the line.

(iii) For a metric space X, the pseudogroup W(X) of bounded perturbations of the identity
consists of bijections γ : S → T such that supx∈S d(γ(x), x) < ∞. In agreement with the
main example of [DeSS], we like to call W(X) the pseudogroup of wobbling bijections; the
notion seems to come from the important work by Laczkovich [Lacz]. See also Item 0.5.C′′1
in [Gro3].

(iv) Given a pseudogroup G of transformations of a set X and a subset A of X, the set of
bijections γ ∈ G with α(γ) ⊂ A and ω(γ) ⊂ A constitute a pseudogroup of transformations
of A, denoted below by G(A).

(v) From a pseudogroup (G, X) and an integer k ≥ 1, one obtains a pseudogroup Gk of
transformations of the direct product Xk of X and {1, . . . , k}, generated by the bijections
of the form

( S × {j} −→ T × {j′}
7−→ (γ(x), j′)

(x, j)
where γ : S → T is in G and 1 ≤ j, j′ ≤ k.
3. Remarks. The above notion of pseudogroup of transformations is strongly motivated
by the study of Banach-Tarski paradoxes, as shown by the ﬁrst three observations below.
(i) The very deﬁnition of a paradoxical decomposition with respect to a group action

involves the associated pseudogroup as in Example 2.(i).

(ii) Pseudogroups are easily restricted on subsets as in Example 2.(iv). This is important

for the study of supramenability (see Chapter V below).

(iii) Pseudogroups are easily induced on oversets, as in Example 2.(v). This is useful in
the setting of a pseudogroup constituted by bijections with domains and range required to
be in a given algebra (or σ-algebra) of subsets of X (for example the measurable sets of a
measure space), and in corresponding variations on the Tarski alternative [HS1].

4

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

(iv) For a pseudogroup (G, X), the set

R =(cid:8)(x, y) ∈ X × X(cid:12)(cid:12) there exists γ ∈ G such that x ∈ α(γ) and y = γ(x)(cid:9)

is an equivalence relation. A natural problem is to study the existence of measures µ
on X such that, for each measurable subset A of X of measure zero, the saturated set
{x ∈ A| there exists a ∈ A with (x, a) ∈ R} has also measure zero, see [CoFW], [Kai2],
[Kai3].

(v) In a topological context, Conditions (iv) and (v) in Deﬁnition 1 are usually replaced

by a condition involving restrictions to open subsets; see [Sac] and page 1 of [KoNo].

(vi) Consider a metric space X, the pseudogroup W(X) of Example 2.(iii), and a sub-
space A of X. It is then remarkable (though straightforward to check) that the pseudogroup
W(A) coincides with the restriction of W(X) to A in the sense of Example 2.(iv).
II.2. Amenability and paradoxical decompositions - the Tarski alternative
Let (G, X) be a pseudogroup. We denote by P(X) the set of all subsets of X.
4. Deﬁnitions. A G-invariant mean on X is a mapping µ : P(X) → [0, 1] which is

(f a)
(in)
(no)

ﬁnitely additive: µ(S1 ∪ S2) = µ(S1) + µ(S2) for S1, S2 ⊂ X with S1 ∩ S2 = ∅,
invariant: µ(cid:0)ω(γ)(cid:1) = µ(cid:0)α(γ)(cid:1) for all γ ∈ G,
normalized: µ(X) = 1.

More generally, for A ⊂ X, a G-invariant mean on X normalized on A is a mapping
µ : P(X) → [0,∞] which satisﬁes Conditions (f a) and (in) above, as well as

(no′)

µ(A) = 1.

The pseudogroup G is amenable if there exists a G-invariant mean on X, and the triple
(G, X, A) is amenable if there exists a G-invariant mean on X normalized on A. These
notions are essentially due to von Neumann [NeuJ].
5. Deﬁnition. A paradoxical G-decomposition of X is a partition X = X1 ⊔ X2 such that
there exist γj ∈ G with α(γj) = Xj and ω(γj) = X (j = 1, 2).
A pseudogroup (G, X) is paradoxical if it has a paradoxical G-decomposition, or equiva-
lently (because of Theorem 7 below) if it is not amenable.
6. Remarks. (i) There cannot exist such paradoxical G-decomposition if G is amenable.
This is obvious, because (with the notation of Deﬁnitions 4 and 5) one cannot have
1 = µ(X) = µ(X1) + µ(X2) = 2 !

It is remarkable that there is no further obstruction, as Theorem 7 shows.
(ii) Let G and H be two pseudogroups of transformations of the same set X, with G ⊂ H.
If H is amenable, then so is G; if G is paradoxical, then so is H. This will be used for
example in the proof of Theorem 25 (Item 36).
(iii) In short-hand, Deﬁnition 5 reads 2[X] !!= [X]. It has variations in the literature; for

example, one may ask (n + 1)[X]

!!

≤ n[X], or more precisely:

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

5

there exists an integer n ≥ 1 and elements γ1, . . . , γN ∈ G such that
|{j ∈ {1, . . . , N} | x ∈ α(γj)}| ≥ n + 1 for all x ∈ X, namely Pk
and
(cid:12)(cid:12){j ∈ {1, . . . , N} | x ∈ ω(γj)}(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ n for all x ∈ X, namely Pk

Then Remark (i) still holds for the same obvious kind of reason. Indeed, the variation is
equivalent to Deﬁnition 5, as can be seen either with manipulations `a la Cantor-Bernstein
(see for example [HS1]) or as a consequence of the following theorem.

j=1[α(γj)] ≥ (n + 1)[X],

j=1[ω(γj)] ≤ n[X].

7. Theorem (Tarski alternative). Let G be a pseudogroup of transformations of a set
X. Exactly one of the following holds:

- either G is amenable,
- or there exists a paradoxical G-decomposition of X.

Let moreover A be a non-empty subset of X and let G(A) be the pseudogroup obtained by
restriction of G, as in Example 2.(iv). Exactly one of the following holds:

- either there exists a G-invariant mean on X normalized on A,
- or there exists a paradoxical G(A)-decomposition of A.
The theorem originates in Tarski’s work: see [Tar3], as well as earlier papers by Tarski

([Tar1], [Tar2]).

One proof for pseudogroups has been written up in [HS1].

Its starting point is an
application of the Hahn-Banach theorem, to the Banach space ℓ∞(X) of bounded real-
valued functions on X, to the subspace d∞(X) of ﬁnite linear combinations of functions

of the form χ(cid:0)ω(γ)(cid:1) − χ(cid:0)α(γ)(cid:1) for some γ ∈ G (where χ(A) denotes the characteristic
function of A), and to the open cone C of functions F ∈ ℓ∞(X) such that inf x∈X F (x) > 0;
one has to observe that G has an invariant mean if and only if d∞(X) ∩ C = ∅. This
proof uses also ideas of Banach, Cantor-Bernstein, Hausdorﬀ, K¨onig, Kuratowski and von
Neumann.

We give here another proof, based on what we call the Hall-Rado theorem (Theorem
35), which is essentially the “K¨onig theorem” of [Wag]. More precisely, the ﬁrst statement
of Theorem 7 is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 25 and Theorem 32, and the
second statement follows (see the sketch below).

Much more complete information on all this can be found in Wagon’s book (see [Wag],
in particular Corollary 9.2 on page 128). Important more recent work in this area include
[DouF].

Let us sketch the proof of the second statement of the theorem. Assume that the
pseudogroup G(A) is not paradoxical, so that, by the ﬁrst statement, there exists a G(A)-
invariant mean µA : P(A) → [0, 1]. Deﬁne then a mapping µ : P(X) → [0,∞] as follows;
for a subset Y of X, if there exists a partition Y = ⊔1≤j≤nYj and elements γ1 : Y1 →
B1, . . . , γn : Yn → Bn in G with B1, . . . , Bn ⊂ A, then set µ(Y ) =Pn
j=1 µA(Bj); otherwise,
set µ(Y ) = ∞. Then one checks that µ is well deﬁned and that it is a G-invariant mean
on X normalized on A.

8. Remark. A famous theorem of E. Hopf can be expressed very much like Tarski’s
alternative.

Let T : X −→ X be an ergodic non-singular transformation of a ﬁnite probability space
(X,B, m), with m non-atomic. Let [[T ]] denote the set of all 1-1 non-singular transforma-
tions φ : U → V such that φ(x) belongs to the T -orbit of x for all x ∈ U (with U, V ∈ B);
this [[T ]] is the full groupoid of T of Katznelson and Weiss [KaWe, page 324]. For two
measurable subsets A, B of X, say that A is dominated by B, and write A ≺ B, if there
exists a measurable subset B′ of B with m(B \ B′) > 0 and a bijective transformation
φ : A −→ B′ in [[T ]].
Hopf alternative. (i) In the situation above, exactly one of the following holds:

- there exists a T -invariant probability measure on (X,B) equivalent to m,
- one has X ≺ X.

(ii) Also, exactly one of the following holds:

- there exists a T -invariant inﬁnite measure on (X,B) equivalent to m,
- one has X ≺ X, and there exists A ∈ B with m(A) > 0 such that A is not dominated

by A.

In other words, (i) says that there is a ﬁnite invariant measure in the measure class m if
and only if X itself is not “Hopf-compressible”, and (ii) that there is an inﬁnite invariant
measure in the measure class m if and only if X is Hopf-compressible and some measurable
subset of X of positive measure is not Hopf-compressible [Weis].

If there exists a T -invariant probability measure [respectively inﬁnite measure] on (X,B)

equivalent to m, then T is said to be of type II1 [resp. of Type II∞].

II.3. The case of groups

For any group G, we consider ﬁrst the pseudogroup GG which is associated with the action
of G on itself on the left, as in Example 2.(i).
Let now G be a group generated by a ﬁnite set S. Let ℓS : G → N denote the corre-
sponding word length function; thus ℓS associates with g ∈ G the smallest integer n ≥ 0 for
which there exist s1, . . . , sn ∈ S∪ S−1 with g = s1 . . . sn. Let dL and dR denote respectively
the left and right invariant metrics on G deﬁned by

dL(x, y) = ℓS(cid:0)x−1y(cid:1)
dR(x, y) = ℓS(cid:0)xy−1(cid:1)

for all x, y ∈ G.
Besides GG, we consider also the pseudogroup PiIs(G) of piecewise isometries of the
metric space (G, dL), as in Example 2.(ii), as well as the pseudogroup W(G) of bounded
perturbations of the identity of the metric space (G, dR), as in Example 2.(iii). It is easy
to check that the pseudogroup W(G) does not depend on the choice of S.
9. Observation With the notation above, one has GG = W(G) for any ﬁnitely generated
group G.

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

7

Proof. It is obvious that GG ⊂ W(G). Conversely, let γ : U → V be in W(G). Set

k = sup
x∈U

dR(γ(x), x)

B = { g ∈ G| ℓS(g) ≤ k }

and observe that B is a ﬁnite subset of G. For each g ∈ B, set

Ug = { x ∈ U | γ(x) = gx}.

One has U = ⊔g∈BUg and γ(x) = gx for all x ∈ Ug. Hence γ ∈ GG.

(cid:3)

It is clear that GG ⊂ PiIs(G). It is also clear that GG 6= PiIs(G) in general (example:

for G = Z generated by {1}, the isometry n 7→ −n is not in GZ).

If G is ﬁnitely generated, the previous observation shows that one may equivalently

10. Deﬁnition. A group G is amenable if the pseudogroup GG is amenable.
deﬁne G to be amenable if the pseudogroup W(G) is amenable.

11. On the class of amenable groups. Amenability may be viewed as a ﬁniteness
condition. One of the main problems is to understand various classes of amenable groups,
for example those which are ﬁnitely generated or ﬁnitely presented. (Recall that a group
is amenable if and only if all its ﬁnitely generated subgroups are amenable; see Theorem
1.2.7 in [Gre1] and Observation 19 below.)

The following question, implicit in [NeuJ], was formulated explicitely by Day, at the
end of Section 4 in [Day1]: does every non-amenable group contain a free group on 2
generators? As much as we know and despite several misleading allusions in the literature
to some “von Neumann conjecture”, von Neumann himself has never conjectured that a
non-amenable group should contain a non-abelian free subgroup!

Day’s question was answered negatively by A. Yu. Ol’shanskii [Ol1], Adyan [Ady2] and
Gromov [Gro2, Corollary 5.6.D]; the ﬁrst two use cogrowth criteria (see Item 52 below)
and Gromov uses Property (T). For inﬁnite groups, this Property (T) of Kazhdan [Kaz] is
(among other things) a strong form of non-amenability: see [Sch] and [CoWe]. However,
when restricted to the class of linear groups (i.e. of groups which have faithful ﬁnite-
dimensional linear representations), Day’s question can be answered positively: this follows
from an important result due to Tits [Tit].

M. Day has deﬁned the class EG of “elementary amenable groups”, which is the small-
est class of groups which contains ﬁnite groups and abelian groups, and which is closed
under the four operations of (i) taking subgroups, (ii) forming factor groups, (iii) group
extensions and (iv) upwards directed unions. He has asked (again in [Day1]) whether the
class EG coincides with the class AG of all amenable groups (see also [Cho]).

Today, we know that there are ﬁnitely generated groups in AG which are not in EG;
this has ﬁrst been shown using growth estimates ([Gri2], [Gri3]), and more recently by an
elegant argument of Stepin (see [Ste], based on [Gri2]).

8

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

One knows also ﬁnitely presented groups in AG which are not in EG; more precisely, the

ﬁnite presentation

G = * a, b, c, d, t (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a2 = b2 = c2 = d2 = bcd = (ad)4 = (adacac)4 = 1
t−1at = aca t−1bt = d t−1ct = b

t−1dt = c +

deﬁnes an amenable group which is not elementary amenable ([Gri6], [Gri7]).

12. Bartholdi’s presentation. It has later been shown that the group G of [Gri6] has a
presentation with two generators only (namely a and t) and four relations of total length
109 = 2 + 19 + 32 + 56. Here are Bartholdi’s computations, where T stands for t−1.

The relations c = aT ata, d = tcT and b = T ct show ﬁrst that the relations c2 = d2 =
b2 = 1 may be deleted in the presentation above, and second that the generators b, c, d
may also be deleted. Thus

G = * a, t (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a2 = T ctctcT = (atcT )4 = (atcT acac)4 = 1

T 2ct2 = tcT

+

where c holds for aT ata. The relation T ctctcT = 1 implies T 2ctctc = 1 = tcT 2ctc (by
conjugation), hence also (using c−1 = c)

1 = (cid:0)T 2ctctc(cid:1)(cid:0)tcT 2ctc(cid:1)−1

= T 2ct2 (tcT )−1

using free simpliﬁcations, so that the relation T 2ct2 = tcT may also be deleted. Finally,
one observes that atcT is conjugate to T atc = (T ata)2 so that (atcT )4 = 1 may be written
(T ata)8 = 1, and one observes also that atcT acac is equal to ataT ataT aaT ataaaT ata, so
is conjugate to T 2ataT at2aT ata. One obtains ﬁnally Bartholdi’s presentation

G = (cid:28) a, t (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a2 = T aT atataT atataT ataT = (T ata)8 = (T 2ataT at2aT ata)4 = 1 (cid:29) .

13. Categorical considerations. For a given integer k, let Fk be the free group on k
generators {s1, . . . , sk} and let Xk denote the space of all marked groups on k generators,
namely of all data Fk ։ Γ, where ։ indicates a homomorphism onto. There is an
appropriate topology on Xk, for which two quotients π : Fk ։ Γ and π′ : Fk ։ Γ′ are
“near” each other if the corresponding Cayley graphs have balls of “large” radius around
the unit element which are isomorphic. This makes Xk a compact space; one shows for
example that the closure of the subset of Xk corresponding to ﬁnite groups contains the
subset of Xk corresponding to residually ﬁnite ﬁnitely generated groups. For details, see
[Gri2], [Cha] and [Ste].

It would be interesting to ﬁnd pairs (Y, Z) where

• Y is a compact subspace of Xk,
• Z is a “small” (e.g. countable) subset of Y , consisting of amenable groups,
• Y \ Z consists of non-elementary amenable groups, or more generally
the set of elementary amenable groups in Y \ Z is of ﬁrst category.

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

9

The point is that the space Y contains a dense Gδ consisting of amenable groups which are
not elementary amenable. (As usual a Gδ in Y is a countable intersection of open subsets
of Y .)

One such pair has been constructed in [Gri2] and analyzed in [Ste], with Z a countable
set of virtually 2-step solvable groups and with Y \ Z consisting of inﬁnite torsion groups.
Understanding other such pairs would probably help us understanding the closures of AGk
and of EGk in Xk, where AGk [respectively EGk] denotes the subspace of Xk containing
marked groups π : Fk ։ Γ with Γ amenable [resp. elementary amenable].

14. Variation on one question of Day. Let us denote by BG the smallest class of
groups containing ﬁnitely generated groups of subexponential growth (see Deﬁnition 64)
and closed with respect to the four operations of Day listed in 11 above, namely with
respect to (i) taking subgroups, (ii) forming factor groups, (iii) group extensions and (iv)
upwards directed unions.

Question: does one have BG=AG ?

15. Other deﬁnitions of amenability for groups; topological groups. The natural
setting for amenability of groups is that of topological groups, mainly locally compact
groups. A substantial part of the theory consists in showing the equivalence of a large
number of deﬁnitions.

Let G be a Hausdorﬀ topological group. Denote by Cb(G) the Banach space of bounded
continuous functions from G to C, with the supremum norm. For ξ ∈ Cb(G) and g ∈ G,
let gξ ∈ Cb(G) be the function x → f (g−1x). Denote by UCb(G) the closed subspace of
Cb(G) of functions ξ for which the mapping g 7→ gξ from G to Cb(G) is continuous. The
following are known to be equivalent (see Theorem 3 in [Day2] and Theorem 4.2 in [Ric2]):
• there exists a left-invariant mean on UCb(G),
• any continuous action G×Q → Q of G by aﬃne transformations of a non-empty compact
convex subset Q of a Hausdorﬀ locally convex topological vector space has a ﬁxed point.
In case G is assumed to be locally

The group G is amenable if these properties hold.
compact, here is a short list of other equivalent properties:
• there exists a left-invariant mean on Cb(G),
• there exists a left-invariant mean on L∞(G),
• the unit representation of G is weakly contained in the left regular representation of G
on L2(G),
• for any continuous action G×X → X of G by homeomorphisms of a non-empty compact

space X, there exists a G-invariant probability measure on X.

The last point, on G-invariant measures, goes back to a paper by Bogolyubov, see [Bogl],
quoted by Anosov [Ano]. This paper, published in Ukrainian in 1939, has remained un-
noticed; the paper does not quote von Neumann [NeuJ], and it is conceivable that Bo-
golyubov has introduced independently the notion of amenability. About relations between
amenability, growth and existence of invariant measures, we would also like to quote [Bekl].

erty, the existence of approximate units in the Fourier algebra, . . .) See, e.g., the books
[Gre1], [Pat] and [Wag], as well as [Rei, Chapter 8], [Eym2], [Zim, Chapter 4], [Wag, in
particular Theorem 10.11] and [Lub, Chapter 2]. In case of a countable group (with the
discrete topology), here is the most recent characterization of amenability with which one
of the authors has been involved: a countable group G is amenable if and only if, for any
action of G by homeomorphisms on the Cantor discontinuum K, there exists a probability
measure on K which is invariant by G [GiH2].

We would like to point out that some attention has been given to topological groups
which are not locally compact (in [Ric2, Section 4] among other places). For example, let
U(H)st be the group of unitary operators on a separable inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space
H, with the strong topology; then U(H)st is amenable, namely there exists a left invariant
mean on UCb (U(H)st), but there does not exist any left invariant mean on Cb (U(H)st)
[Har1, Har2]. Moreover, this group does have closed subgroups which are not amenable;
indeed, if H = ℓ2(Fn) for a free group Fn of rank n ≥ 2, then U(H)st has clearly a discrete
subgroup isomorphic to Fn, as observed in [Har3]. Here is another example involving non
locally compact topologies; let G be the group of real points of an R-algebraic group and
let Γ be a subgroup of G which is dense for the Zariski topology; if Γ is amenable, so is G
(see [Moo], and Theorem 4.1.15 in [Zim]).

Let us mention the following: for a locally compact group G which is almost connected
(this means that the quotient of G by the connected component of 1 is compact), the three
properties

G is amenable,
G does not contain a discrete subgroup which is free on 2 generators,
G/r(G) is compact,

are equivalent. This is due to Rickert: Theorem 5.5 in [Ric2], building on [Ric1]; see also
Theorem 3.8 in [Pat]. Recall that the solvable radical r(G) of a locally compact group
G is the largest connected closed normal solvable subgroup of G [Iwa]. (One may deﬁne
similarly the amenable radical of G as the largest amenable closed normal subgroup of G;
see Lemma 1 of Section 4 in [Day1] and Proposition 4.1.12 in [Zim].)

This result of Rickert reduces in some sense the problem of understanding the class
of amenable locally compact groups to totally disconnected groups; we believe moreover
that the most important (and diﬃcult) part of the problem is that which concerns ﬁnitely
generated groups.

16. Cohomological deﬁnitions of amenability. There are various (co)homological
characterizations of amenability.

One is that of Johnson: a group G is amenable if and only if H 1(ℓ1(G), M∗) is reduced
to {0} whenever M∗ is a G-module dual to some Banach G-module M [Joh]. It follows
that the bounded cohomology of an amenable group is always reduced to {0}; this is given

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

11

by Gromov (Section 3.0 in [Gro1]) together with a reference to an unpublished explanation
of Philip Trauber - hence the name “Trauber theorem”.

Another one is in terms of “uniformly ﬁnite homology”; it applies to ﬁnitely generated
groups, and indeed to metric spaces in a much broader class. Such a space X is not
amenable if and only if the group H uf
0 (X) is reduced to {0} (in this statement, one may
take R as coeﬃcients, or equivalently Z); this is one way to express that the Følner
condition does not hold in X [BlW1].

It seems also appropriate to quote here a theorem of Brooks: let G be the covering group
of a normal covering M of a compact manifold X; then G is amenable if and only if 0 is
in the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on the space of square-integrable
functions on M (see [Bro], or the exposition in [Lot]).

There are other conditions in terms of other “coarse” (co)homology theories of the
groups, or in terms of K-theory of appropriate algebras associated with the group (see
various papers by G. Elek, including [Ele2]).

Let us mention that there are interesting cohomological consequences of amenability. For
example, let G be a group which has an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(G, 1) which is a ﬁnite
complex; if G is amenable, then G has Euler characteristic χ(G) = 0 (a particular case of
Corollary 0.6 of Cheeger and Gromov [ChGr], who use ℓ2-cohomology methods, and also
a result of B. Eckmann, who uses other methods [Eck]). Also, let G be the fundamental
group of some closed 4-manifold M; if G is inﬁnite and amenable, then χ(M) ≥ 0 [Eck].
17. Variations on amenability of groups. There are standard variations on the
pseudogroup GG and the notion of amenability.
One is to consider the pseudogroup GG×G associated as in Example 2.(i) with the action
of G × G on G deﬁned by (x, y) ◦ g = xgy−1. It is classical that GG×G is amenable if and
only if GG is amenable. In other words: G has a left invariant mean if and only if G has a
two-sided invariant mean (Lemma 1.1.1 and Lemma 1.1.3 in [Gre1]).
Another variation is to consider the action of G on G \ {1} deﬁned by x ◦ g = xgx−1
and the notion of inner amenability for a group. It is obvious that an amenable group
is inner amenable. Straightforward examples (such as non-trivial direct products of free
groups and amenable groups) show that there are non-amenable groups which are inner
amenable. More on this in [BeHa], [Eﬀ], [GiH1] and [HS2].

A third variation is to consider a subgroup H of G and the pseudogroup GG/H associated
with the natural action of G on G/H. The subgroup H is said to be co-amenable in G
if GG/H is amenable. There is a comprehensive analysis of this notion in [Eym1]; see also
[Bekk], in particular Theorem 2.3. In case G = Fm is a free group of ﬁnite rank, a criterion
for co-amenability of a subgroup in terms of cogrowth is given in [Gri1] (see Item 52 below).
One may generalize actions of G on G/H to actions of G on locally compact spaces; co-
amenability of H is then a particular case of a notion of amenability for actions known as
amenability in the sense of Greenleaf [Gre2].

The notion of amenability for a group and that of co-amenability for a subgroup may
both be viewed as particular cases of a notion for G-mappings, for which we refer to [AnaR].
In case of a group G with the discrete topology, it can be deﬁned as follows. Let X, Y be

12

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

two Borel spaces given with measure classes µ, ν and with actions of G by non-singular
invertible Borel mappings, and let φ : X → Y be a surjective Borel mapping such that
φ∗(µ) = ν; thus there is a canonical linear isometric mapping by which we identify the
Banach space L∞(Y, ν) with a closed G-invariant subspace of L∞(X, µ). Say the mapping
φ is amenable if there exists a G-equivariant linear mapping E : L∞(X, µ) → L∞(Y, ν)
which is a conditional expectation, namely which is positive and which restricts to the
identity on L∞(Y, ν). Example 1: X = G and Y is reduced to one point; then X → Y
is amenable if and only if G is amenable. Example 2: X = G/H for a subgroup H of G
and Y is reduced to a point; then X → Y is amenable if and only if H is co-amenable in
G. Example 3: X = G × Z for a G-space Z (with G acting from the left on itself and
diagonally on the product G× Z); then the projection G× Z → Z is amenable if and only
if the action of G on Z is amenable in the sense of Zimmer [Zim, Section 4.3].
There are other notions, including the three following ones: K-amenability [Cun], weak
amenability `a la Cowling-Haagerup [CowH], and a-T-menability `a la Gromov. (See 7.A
and 7.E in [Gro3], and [BekCV]; in fact Gromov rediscovered the class of groups having
“Property 3B” of Akemann and Walter in [AkWa].)

II.4. Tarski number of paradoxical group actions

Consider more generally the pseudogroup GG,X associated with a group action G× X → X
(see again Example 2.(i)).
18. Deﬁnition. For γ : S → T in GG,X , deﬁne the Tarski number of γ as the small-
est “number of pieces” n such that there exists a partition S = ⊔1≤j≤nSj and elements
g1, . . . , gn in G with γ(x) = gj(x) for all x ∈ Sj, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}.

The Tarski number of a paradoxical GG,X-decomposition

X = X1G X2

,

γ1 : X1 → X ,

γ2 : X2 → X

as above is the sum of the Tarski number of γ1 and of that of γ2. It is clear that such a
sum is an integer ≥ 4.
When GG,X is not amenable, we deﬁne the Tarski number T (G, X) of the action G×X →
X as the minimum of the Tarski numbers of the paradoxical GG,X-decompositions of X;
when GG,X is amenable, we set T (G, X) = ∞. For a group G acting on itself by left
multiplication, we write T (G) rather than T (G, G).
19. Observation. Let G be a group given together with a subgroup G′ and a quotient
group G′′. It is straightforward that one has

T (G) ≤ T (G′)
T (G) ≤ T (G′′).

For example, for the ﬁrst of these inequalities, view G as a disjoint union of cosets of G′.
Each group G has a ﬁnitely generated subgroup G′ such that T (G′) = T (G). Indeed,

assuming G to be non-amenable, consider a paradoxical decomposition

G = X1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ Xm ⊔ Y1 . . . ⊔ Yn = g1X1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ gmXm = h1Y1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ hnYn

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

13

containing m + n = T (G) pieces (where X1, . . . , Xm, Y1, . . . , Yn are subsets of G and
g1, . . . , gm, h1, . . . , hn are elements of G). Let G′ be the subgroup of G generated by
{g1, . . . , gm, h1, . . . , hn}. Set X′i = Xi ∩ G′ for all i ∈ {1, . . . , m} and Y ′j = Yj ∩ G′ for
all j ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Then

G′ = X′1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ X′m ⊔ Y ′1 . . . ⊔ Y ′n = g1X′1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ gmX′m = h1Y ′1 ⊔ . . . ⊔ hnY ′n

so that T (G′) ≤ T (G). With the ﬁrst inequality of the present observation, this shows that
T (G′) = T (G). (One may observe a fortiori that X′1, . . . , Y ′n are non-empty.) It follows
that one has

T (G) = inf(cid:0)T (G′)(cid:1)

where the inﬁmum is taken over all ﬁnitely generated subgroups G′ of G.

It should be interesting to study how the Tarski number behaves with respect to other
group theoretical constructions such as extensions and HNN-constructions. In particular,
for the latter, we have in mind some presentations of the Richard Thompson’s F group
[CaFP]; recall that F is a group which does not have non-abelian free subgroups, which is
an HNN-extension of itself [BrGe], that F is inner-amenable [Jol], that F has non-abelian
free subsemigroups so that it is not supramenable (see Chapter V below), and that one
does not know whether F is amenable or not.

20. Proposition (Jonsson, Dekker). For a group G, one has T (G) = 4 if and only

if G contains a non-abelian free subgroup.
Proof. For the free group F2 on 2 generators g and h, it is classical that T (F2) = 4; see,
e.g., Figure 4.1 in [Wag]. We recall this as follows. Set

A1 = W(cid:0)g(cid:1)
A2 = W(cid:0)g−1(cid:1)
B1 = W(cid:0)h(cid:1) ∪(cid:8)1, h−1, h−2, . . .(cid:9)
B2 = W(cid:0)h−1(cid:1) r(cid:8)h−1, h−2, . . .(cid:9)

where W (x) denotes the subset of F2 consisting of reduced words on {g, h} with x as ﬁrst
letter on the left, for x ∈ {g, g−1, h, h−1}. Then

F2 = A1G A2G B1G B2 = A1G gA2 = B1G hB2.

It follows that T (F2) = 4.
to F2.

Observation 19 shows that T (G) = 4 for any group G containing a subgroup isomorphic

Conversely, let G be a group with T (G) = 4, so that there exist subsets X1, X2, Y1, Y2

and elements g1, g2, h1, h2 in G such that

G = X1G X2G Y1G Y2 = g1X1G g2X2 = h1Y1G h2Y2.

14

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

Set g = g−1

1 g2 and h = h−1

1 h2. Then, one has successively

X1 = G r gX2 = gX1G gY1G gY2
X1 ⊃ gX1 ⊃ . . . ⊃ gk−1X1 ⊃ gkYj
(k ≥ 1
X2 = G r g−1X1 = g−1X2G g−1Y1G g−1Y2
X2 ⊃ g−1X2 ⊃ . . . ⊃ g−k+1X2 ⊃ g−kYj

and j = 1, 2)

(k ≥ 1

and j = 1, 2)

so that

gkYj ⊂ X1 ∪ X2

for all

k ∈ Z , k 6= 0 and j = 1, 2.

One has similarly

hkXj ⊂ Y1 ∪ Y2

for all

k ∈ Z , k 6= 0 and j = 1, 2.

Hence g and h generate in G a free subgroup of rank 2, by a classical lemma going back es-
sentially to F. Klein, and sometimes known as the “table-tennis lemma” (see, e.g., [Har4]).
(cid:3)

The argument above is our rephrasing of the proof of Theorem 4.8 in [Wag].

Proposition 20 is an unpublished work from the 40’s by B. Jonsson (a student of Tarski)
and is a particular case of results of Dekker published in the 50’s. For precise references,
see the Notes of Chapter 4 in [Wag].

Let us also mention that, for a group G containing a non abelian free group and for an
action G × X → X with stabilizers {g ∈ G| gx = x} which are abelian for all x ∈ X, the
corresponding Tarski number is also given by T (G, X) = 4 (Theorem 4.5 in [Wag]).

21. Proposition. For a non-amenable torsion group G, one has T (G) ≥ 6.
Proof. By Proposition 20 we know that T (G) ≥ 5. We assume that T (G) = 5, and we
will reach a contradiction.

The hypothesis implies that there exist subsets X1, X2, Y1, Y2, Y3 and elements g1, g2, h1, h2, h3

in G such that

G = X1G X2G Y1G Y2G Y3 = g1X1G g2X2 = h1Y1G h2Y2G h3Y3.

1 g2. As in the proof of Proposition 11, one has

Let n denote the order of g + g−1

X1 ⊃ gX1 ⊃ . . . ⊃ gn−1X1 ⊃ gn(cid:16)Y1G Y2G Y3(cid:17) .

But now gn = 1 and this is absurd. Hence T (G) > 5.

(cid:3)

22. Question. Does there exist a group G with Tarski number T (G) equal to 5 ? to 6 ?
More generally, what are the possible values of T (G) ?

II.5. Følner condition for pseudogroups

Let (G, X) be a pseudogroup of transformations. For a subset R of G and a subset A of
X, we deﬁne the R-boundary of A as

∂RA = ( x ∈ X r A(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ρ(x) ∈ A ) .
there exists ρ ∈ R ∪ R−1 such that
23. Deﬁnition. The pseudogroup (G, X) satisﬁes the Følner condition if
for any ﬁnite subset R of G and for any real number ǫ > 0
there exists a ﬁnite non-empty subset F = F (R, ǫ) of X
such that

x ∈ α(ρ)

and

|∂RF| < ǫ|F|

where |F| denotes the cardinality of the set F .
24. Ahlfors and Følner.
Ideas underlying the Følner condition go back at least to
Ahlfors. (Følner does not refer to this work.) Ahlfors deﬁnes an open Riemann surface S
to be regularly exhaustible if, for some appropriate metric g in the conformal class deﬁned
by the complex structure of S, there exists a nested sequence Ω1 ⊂ Ω2 ⊂ . . . of domains
with smooth boundaries such that Sn≥1 Ωn is the whole surface and such that

lim
n→∞

|∂Ωn|g
|Ωn|g

= 0

where |Ω|g denotes the area of a domain Ω and where |∂Ω|g denotes the length of its
boundary, both with respect to g. (A lemma of Ahlfors shows that this does not depend
on the choice of g.) These sequences may be used to deﬁne averaging processes, as Ahlfors
did ﬁrst and as Følner did later.

Using this notion, Ahlfors has developped a geometric approach to the Nevanlinna theory
of distribution of values of meromorphic functions, known as Ahlfors theory of covering
surfaces. In particular, he gave a generalization of the second main theorem of Nevanlinna
on defect. (See Section 25 in Chapter III of [Ahl]; see also Chapter XIII in [Nev], Chapter
5 in [Hay], Theorem 6.5 on page 1223 of [Oss], [Sto] and [ZoK].)

Amenability of coverings of Riemann surfaces can also be expressed in terms of Te-

ichm¨uller spaces [McM2].

25. Theorem. A pseudogroup of transformations is amenable if and only if it satisfes the
Følner condition.

Følner’s original proof (for a group acting on itself by left multiplications) goes back to
1955 [Fol]. The proof has been simpliﬁed by Namioka [Nam] (who generalized Følner’s
result to one-sided cancellative semigroups), and extended to group actions by Rosenblatt
[Ros1]; the best place to read it is probably Section 2.1 of [Co1]. In case of a group G
acting by conjugation on G r {1}, the proof can also be found in [BeHa], and it applies
verbatim to an action of G on any set X. All these references use essentially techniques

16

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

of functional analysis. (See also Wagon’s comment about the implication (6) =⇒ (1) in
Theorem 10.11 of [Wag].)

The proof below, in Items 26 and 36, uses completely diﬀerent techniques.

26. Beginning of the proof of Theorem 25. We prove here the implication “Følner
condition ⇒ existence of an invariant mean”.
Let M(X) denote the set of all means on X, namely of all ﬁnitely additive probability
measures on X (see Conditions (fa) and (no) in Deﬁnition 4). Let ℓ∞(X) denote the
Banach space of all bounded functions on X, with the norm of uniform convergence; it is
standard2 that M(X) can be identiﬁed with a subset of the unit ball in the dual space of
ℓ∞(X). It is also standard that the weak∗-topology makes M(X) into a compact space.

For each ﬁnite non-empty subset F of X, we consider the mean

µF : 


P(X)
A

−→
7−→

[0, 1]
|A ∩ F|

|F|

in M(X). Consider also the set

ordered by

N = { (R, ǫ) |R ⊂ G is ﬁnite, and ǫ ∈ R, ǫ > 0}
(R, ǫ) ≤ (R′, ǫ′)
and ǫ ≥ ǫ′.

R ⊂ R′

if

(cid:0)µF (R,ǫ)(cid:1)(R,ǫ)∈N

Notation being as in Deﬁnition 23 of the Følner condition (which is now assumed to hold),
(∗)
becomes a net. By compacity of M(X), this net has a cluster point, say µ (we use the
terminology of [Kel, Chapter 2]). The proof consists in showing that µ is G-invariant; in
other words, given a subset A of X and a transformation γ in G with A ⊂ α(γ), one has
to show that µ(cid:0)γ(A)(cid:1) = µ(A).
We choose a number δ > 0. As µ is a cluster point of the family (∗), there exists
(R, ǫ) ∈ N such that
(i)

i.e., R ∋ γ

and ǫ ≤ δ,

(R, ǫ) ≥ ({γ}, δ),
|µF (R,ǫ)(A) − µ(A)| ≤ δ,

(ii)

(iii)

From now on, we write F instead of F (R, ǫ). Deﬁne

(cid:12)(cid:12)µF (R,ǫ)(cid:0)γ(A)(cid:1) − µ(cid:0)γ(A)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ δ.

Ai,i = { a ∈ A| a ∈ F and γ(a) ∈ F } = A ∩ F ∩ γ−1(F ),
Ai,o = { a ∈ A| a ∈ F and γ(a) ∈ ∂RF } = A ∩ F ∩ γ−1(X r F ),
Ao,i = { a ∈ A| a ∈ ∂RF and γ(a) ∈ F } = A ∩ (X r F ) ∩ γ−1(F ),
Ao,o = { a ∈ A| a /∈ F and γ(a) /∈ F } = A ∩ (X r F ) ∩ γ−1(X r F )

|A ∩ F| = |Ai,i| + |Ai,o|

so that

so that

|Ai,o| + |Ao,i| ≤ 2|∂RF| ≤ 2ǫ|F|.

It follows from (iv) to (vi) that

Using the deﬁnition of the mean µF and the conclusion of the Følner condition, one may
rewrite (vii) as

(vii)

(viii)

(cid:12)(cid:12)|γ(A) ∩ F| − |A ∩ F|(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 2ǫ|F|.
(cid:12)(cid:12)µF(cid:0)γ(A)(cid:1) − µF (A)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 2ǫ
(cid:12)(cid:12)µ(cid:0)γ(A)(cid:1) − µ(A)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≤ 2δ + 2ǫ ≤ 4δ

so that one obtains ﬁnally

using (ii), (iii) and (viii). As the choice of δ is arbitrary, this ends the proof of one
implication of Theorem 25.
(cid:3)

27. Remark. In case of a locally ﬁnite graph X with ﬁnitely many orbits of vertices under
the full automorphism group (for example in case of a Cayley graph), Følner condition is
equivalent to the existence of a nested sequence F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ . . . of ﬁnite subsets of the
vertex set X 0 such that ∪n≥1Fn = X 0 and limn→∞ |∂Fn|/|Fn| = 0; see our Section III.2 for
amenable graphs and for the notation ∂Fn, and Theorem 4.39 in [Soa] for the equivalence.
In the case of a group G acting on a set X, the Følner condition is most often expressed
in a way involving the symmetric diﬀerence between a ﬁnite subset F of X and its image
gF by some g ∈ G; for the equivalence of this with the analogue of our Deﬁnition 23, see
Proposition 4.3 in [Ros1].
For groups, Følner condition implies the existence of Følner sets with extra tiling prop-
erties, and this is useful for showing extensions to amenable groups of the Rohlin theorem
from ergodic theory [OrWe].

III. Amenability and paradoxical decompositions for metric spaces

III.1. Gromov condition and doubling condition

Let X be a metric space and let d denote the distance on X.

For S, T ⊂ X, a mapping φ : S → T (not necessarily a bijection) is a bounded perturbation

of the identity if supx∈S d(φ(x), x) < ∞. We will denote by

B(X)

the collection of all these maps. (This would be an example of a “pseudo-semigroup”, but
we will not use this term again below.)

18

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

As in Example 2.(iii), we denote by W(X) the pseudogroup of all bijections, between
subsets of X, which are bounded perturbations of the identity.
For a subset A of X and a real number k > 0, we denote by
Nk(A) = { x ∈ X | d(x, A) ≤ k }

the k-neighbourhood of A in X.

Recall that a metric space is locally ﬁnite 3 if its subsets of ﬁnite diameter are ﬁnite.

28. Deﬁnitions. A locally ﬁnite metric space X is said to be amenable [respectively
paradoxical] if the pseudogroup W(X) is amenable [resp. paradoxical].

Caution. This deﬁnition is not convenient for non-locally ﬁnite metric spaces, because

the pseudogroup W(R) is paradoxical. Indeed, the bijections
γodd : [n∈Z

γeven : [n∈Z

[2n, 2n + 1[−→ R

and

[2n + 1, 2n + 2[−→ R

deﬁned by γeven|[2n,2n+1[(t) = 2t − (2n + 1/2) and γodd|[2n+1,2n+2[(t) = 2t − (2n + 3/2), are
in W(R) and deﬁne a paradoxical decomposition of R.
A notion of amenability for some non-locally ﬁnite metric spaces is suggested in Remark
42.

29. Deﬁnition. A locally ﬁnite metric space X is said to satisfy the Gromov condition if
there exists a mapping φ : X → X in B(X) such that

for all x ∈ X.

(cid:12)(cid:12)φ−1(x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ 2

This terminology refers in particular to the “lemme 6.17” in [GrLP], introduced there
as “le meilleur moyen de montrer qu’un groupe est non-moyennable”; see also Item 0.5.C′′1
in [Gro3].

30. Deﬁnition. The locally ﬁnite metric space X satisﬁes the doubling condition if there
exists a constant K > 0 such that

(cid:12)(cid:12)NK(F )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ 2|F|
(cid:12)(cid:12)Nk(F )(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ (1 + ǫ)|F|

for any non-empty ﬁnite subset F of X.

It is of course equivalent to ask that there exists a constant k > 0 and a number ǫ > 0

such that

for any non-empty ﬁnite subset F of X; indeed, this implies |NK(F )| ≥ 2|F| for any
non-empty ﬁnite subset F of X, with K = nk and n an integer such that (1 + ǫ)n ≥ 2.

3The terminology “discrete” of the 1999 published version is not appropriate. More on this in Chapter

VI.

31. Bipartite graphs and matchings. Let B = Bip(Y, Z; E) be a bipartite graph
with two classes Y, Z of vertices and with edge set E; by deﬁnition of “bipartite”, any edge
e ∈ E is incident with one vertex in Y and one vertex in Z; we consider here simple graphs,
namely graphs without loops and without multiple edges. Recall that, for integers k, l ≥ 1,
a perfect (k, l)-matching of B is a subset M of E such that any y ∈ Y [respectively any
z ∈ Z] is incident to exactly k edges in M [resp. l edges in M].
For a set F of vertices of B, we denote by ∂EF the set of vertices in B which are not in
F , and are connected to some vertex of F by some e ∈ E.
Let again X be a metric space, as earlier in the present section. With two subsets
S, T ⊂ X and a real number K ≥ 0, one associates the bipartite graph BK(S, T ) with vertex
classes S and T , and with an edge connecting x ∈ S and y ∈ T whenever d(x, y) ≤ K;
note that, by deﬁnition, S and T are disjoint in the vertex set of BK(S, T ), even if they
need not be as subsets of X. Observe that X is locally ﬁnite if and only if BK(X, X) is
locally ﬁnite for all K ≥ 0.

32. Theorem. For a locally ﬁnite metric space X, the following conditions are equiva-

lent (with B(X) as before Deﬁnition 28).

(i) The space X is paradoxical.

(namely X satisﬁes the Gromov condition).

(ii) There exists a mapping φ : X → X in B(X) such that (cid:12)(cid:12)φ−1(x)(cid:12)(cid:12) = 2 for all x ∈ X.
(iii) There exists a mapping φ : X → X in B(X) such that (cid:12)(cid:12)φ−1(x)(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ 2 for all x ∈ X

(iv) The space X satisﬁes the doubling condition.
(v) There exists a real number K > 0 for which the bipartite graph BK(X, X) has a

perfect (2, 1)-matching.

(vi) The pseudogroup W(X) does not satisfy the Følner condition.

33. Observations. As there are amenable groups of exponential growth, for example
ﬁnitely generated solvable groups which are not virtually nilpotent, Conditions (ii) and
(iii) are not connected to growth, as suggested in [DeSS], but indeed to amenability, as
already observed in our Introduction.

For a recent survey on growth and related matters, see [GriH].
Some of the implications of Theorem 32 may be made more precise. See for example

Proposition 54 below.

34. Proof of Theorem 32.

(i) ⇐⇒ (ii).

but a rephrasing of Condition (ii).

If X is paradoxical, there exists a partition X = X1 ⊔ X2 and two
bijections γj : Xj → X in W(X). The mapping φ : X → X deﬁned by φ(x) = γj(x)
for x ∈ Xj (j = 1, 2) satisﬁes (ii).
Conversely, given a mapping φ : X → X as in (ii), one uses the axiom of choice to order
the two points of φ−1(x) for each x ∈ X, say as φ−1(x) =(cid:0)γ−1
2 (x)(cid:1). This provides
The implications (ii) =⇒ (iii) =⇒ (iv) are straightforward. Condition (v) is nothing

a paradoxical decomposition involving the mappings γ1 and γ2.

(vi) =⇒ (iv). If W(X) does not satisfy the Følner condition, there exists ǫ > 0 and a
non-empty ﬁnite subset R of W(X) such that, for any non-empty ﬁnite subset F of X,
one has |F ∪ ∂RF| ≥ (1 + ǫ)|F|. Setting

(i) =⇒ (vi). The contraposition not(vi) =⇒ not(i) may be checked as follows:

if the
pseudogroup W(X) satisﬁes the Følner condition, it is amenable by Proof 26, so that
W(X) is not paradoxical by the straightforward part of the Tarski alternative (Remark
6.(i)).

We have now shown all but the right lowest ⇒ in the following diagram:

(v)

(vi)

⇓

(vi) ⇐ (i) ⇔ (ii) ⇒ (iii) ⇒ (iv) ⇒ (v)

For the last implication (iv) =⇒ (v), we follow [DeSS] and call upon a form of the Hall-
Rado Theorem. More precisely, with the notation of Theorem 35 below and with k = K,
(cid:3)

(iv) implies that (cid:12)(cid:12)∂EF(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ 2|F| for any subset F of Y or of Z, so that (v) follows.

All what we will need about the Hall-Rado theorem can be found in [Mir] but, as a
ﬁrst background, we recommend also the discussion in Section III.3 of [Bol]. (Recall that
“Hall” refers to Philip Hall.)

35 Theorem (Hall-Rado). Let B = Bip(Y, Z; E) be a locally ﬁnite bipartite graph and
let k ≥ 1 be an integer. Assume that one has

Then there exists a perfect (k, 1)-matching of B.
On the proof. Consider the bipartite graph Bk = B (⊔1≤j≤kYj, Z; Ek) where ⊔1≤j≤kYj
denotes a disjoint union of k copies of Y , and where, for each edge e ∈ E with ends y ∈ Y
and z ∈ Z, there is one edge ej ∈ Ek with ends the vertex yj ∈ Yj corresponding to y and
the vertex z, this for each j ∈ {1 . . . k}.

One the one hand, the hypothesis implies that

(cid:12)(cid:12)∂EF(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ k|F|
(cid:12)(cid:12)∂EF(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ |F|

for all ﬁnite subsets F of Y

for all ﬁnite subsets F of Z.

(cid:12)(cid:12)∂Ek F(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ |F|

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

21

for all ﬁnite subset F of ⊔1≤j≤kYj or of Z. On the other hand, there exists a perfect
(k, 1)-matching of B if and only if there exists a perfect (1, 1)-matching of Bk. It follows
that one may assume k = 1 without loss of generality.

By the most usual form of the Hall-Rado theorem, there are subsets MY , MZ of E such
that the edges in MY [respectively in MZ] are pairwise disjoint, and such that each y ∈ Y
[resp. each z ∈ Z] is incident with exactly one edge in MY [resp.
in MZ]; see, e.g.,
Theorem 4.2.1 in [Mir]. Thus MY ∪ MZ deﬁne a spanning subgraph of B whose connected
components are either edges, or simple polygons with a number of edges which is even and
at least 4, or inﬁnite lines. (This argument is standard: see e.g. the middle of page 317 in
[Nas].)

One may color the edges of the latter subgraph in black and white such that each vertex
of B is incident to exactly one black edge. The set of black edges thus obtained is a perfect
(1, 1)-matching of B.
(cid:3)

If k = 1, observe that the condition of the Theorem is also necessary for the existence of
a perfect (1, 1)-matching. If k ≥ 2, it is not so (consider a complete bipartite graph with
|Y | = 1 and |Z| = k), despite the statement following Deﬁnition 6 of [DeSS].

36. End of proof of Theorem 25. We show here the implication “existence of an
invariant mean ⇒ Følner condition”, or rather its contraposition: we assume that (G, X)
does not satisfy the Følner condition, and we have to prove that X has no G-invariant
mean.

First case: X is a metric space and G is the pseudogroup W(X). Implication (vi) =⇒ (i)
of Theorem 32 shows that X is paradoxical, hence that X is not amenable. The proof of
Theorem 25 is complete in this case.

General case.

If (G, X) does not satisfy the Følner condition, there exists a number

ǫ > 0 and a non-empty ﬁnite subset R of G such that
|∂RF| > ǫ|F|

for any non-empty ﬁnite subset F of X. Deﬁne a metric dR on X by

dR(x, y) = min


n ∈ N(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

there exists ρ1, . . . , ρn ∈ R ∪ R−1

ρn(cid:16)ρn−1(cid:0) . . . ρ1(x) . . .(cid:1)(cid:17) is deﬁned and is equal to y


such that

with the understanding that dR(x, y) = ∞ if there exists no such n. One has a posteriori

|N1(F )| ≥ (1 + ǫ)|F|

for any non-empty ﬁnite subset F of X, where the neighborhood N1(F ) refers to the metric
dR (for the deﬁnition of N1, see before Deﬁnition 28). Hence the pseudogroup W(X, dR)
is not amenable by the previous case. As W(X, dR) ⊂ G, the pseudogroup G itself is not
amenable either.

37. Deﬁnition. Recall that two metric spaces X, Y are quasi-isometric if there exist
constants λ ≥ 1 , C ≥ 0 and a mapping φ : X → Y such that

1
λ
for all x1, x2 ∈ X and

d(x1, x2) − C ≤ d(cid:0)φ(x1), φ(x2)(cid:1) ≤ λd(x1, x2) + C

for all y ∈ Y .

Recall also that X and Y are Lipschitz equivalent if there exists a constant λ ≥ 1 and a

d(x1, x2) ≤ d(cid:0)ψ(x1), ψ(x2)(cid:1) ≤ λd(x1, x2)

for all x1, x2 ∈ X. (See also Item 0.2.C in [Gro3].)
38. Proposition. Let X and Y be two uniformly locally ﬁnite metric spaces which are
quasi-isometric. Then X is amenable [respectively paradoxical] if and only if Y is so.
Proof. For uniformly locally ﬁnite4 metric spaces, the Gromov condition of Deﬁnition 29
is clearly invariant by quasi-isometry.
(cid:3)

39. Examples. For each prime p, there are uncountably many 2-generated p-groups
which are amenable and pairwise not quasi-isometric; see [Gri2] for p = 2 and [Gri3] for
p ≥ 2.
40. Examples. There are uncountably many 2-generated torsion-free groups which are
paradoxical and pairwise not quasi-isometric [Bow].

41. Remark. It is a result due independently to Volodymyr Nekrashevych [Nek1] and
Kevin Whyte [Why] that two uniformly discrete non-amenable metric spaces X and Y are
quasi-isometric if and only if they are Lipschitz equivalent. This answers a question of
Gromov (Item 1.A′ in [Gro3]); see also [Pap] and [Bogp] for partial answers.

42. Remark. Let (Ω, dΩ) be a metric space. A subset X of Ω is a separated net if there
exists a constant r > 0 for which the two following properties hold: (i) dΩ(x, y) ≥ r for
all x, y ∈ X, x 6= y, and (ii) X is a maximal subset of Ω for this property (this implies
dΩ(ω, X) ≤ 2r for all ω ∈ Ω). Such nets exist by Zorn’s Lemma.
If the metric space Ω is “slim and well-behaved” in the sense of [MaMT], for example if
Ω is a Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below and the injectivity
radius of the exponential map positive, then two nets in Ω are quasi-isometric to each other.
(See Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 in [MaMT], as well as [Kan1], [Kan2] and [Nek1], [Nek2].) For
such slim and well-behaved spaces, there are natural notions of amenability and paradoxes,

4We are grateful to Volker Diekert for having pointed out to us the omission of uniform local ﬁniteness

in the hypotheses in our previous version.

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

23

deﬁned via their nets; this has appeared in several places, including [BlW1]. Proposition
38 carries over to these spaces, by deﬁnition.

43. Examples. There are uncountably many Riemann surfaces of constant curvature
−1 which are amenable as metric spaces, and which are pairwise not quasi-isometric [Gri5].

III.2. Graphs as metric spaces, isoperimetric constants

Let X = (X 0, X 1) be a graph with vertex set X 0 and with edge set X 1 (say X has no
loops and no multiple edges, for simplicity). If X is connected, X 0 is naturally a uniformly
discrete metric space, the distance d(x, y) between two vertices x, y ∈ X 0 being the minimal
number of edges in a path between them.
For a disconnected graph X, there are also notions of combinatorial distances. For
example, if X is a subgraph of a connected graph Y which is clear from the context, one
may restrict to X 0 the distance deﬁned on Y 0 as above. One may also set d(x, y) = ∞ for
x, y in diﬀerent connected components of X.
In this section, we assume that X = (X 0, X 1) is a graph given together with a metric
d : X 0 × X 0 −→ R+ such that d(x, y) is the combinatorial distance whenever x, y are
vertices in the same connected component of X.

44. Deﬁnition. A locally ﬁnite graph X is said to be amenable or paradoxical if the
metric space X 0 is so in the sense of Deﬁnition 28.

For a subset F of X 0, the boundary ∂EF deﬁned in graph theoretical terms in Item 31
(here E = X 1) coincides with N1(F ) \ F , where N1(F ) is the neighborhood deﬁned in
metrical terms before Deﬁnition 28. We will write

below.

∂F = N1(F ) \ F

45. Deﬁnition. The isoperimetric constant of the graph X is

F ⊂ X 0
For example, ι(X) = 0 as soon as X is ﬁnite.

ι(X) = inf(cid:26) |∂F|
|F| (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is ﬁnite and non-empty (cid:27) .

46. Variations. There are several variations on the deﬁnition of the isoperimetric constant
in the literature, because a boundary ∂F could be deﬁned using

either vertices outside F as here (before Deﬁnition 45) or in [BeSc] and [McM1],
or vertices inside F as in [Dod] or [CoSa],
or vertices both inside and outside F as in [OrWe, page 24],
or edges connecting vertices inside F to those outside F as in [BiMS] or [Kai1].

24

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

For example, denoting by ∂∗F the set of edges connecting a vertex of F to a vertex

outside F , there is another isoperimetric constant

ι∗(X) = inf(cid:26) |∂∗F|
|F|

F ⊂ X 0

is ﬁnite and non-empty (cid:27) .

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

for the graph X. One has ι∗(X) ≥ ι(X); if X has maximal degree k, one has also ι∗(X) ≤
kι(X).

47. Example Let d be an integer, d ≥ 3. For a tree T in which every vertex is of degree
at least d, the isoperimetric constant satisﬁes the inequality

ι(T ) ≥ d − 2.

If T is regular of degree d, then ι(T ) = d − 2.
Proof. As we have not found a convenient published reference for this very standard fact,
we indicate now a proof. We denote by T (d) the regular tree of degree d.

Let F be a ﬁnite subset of the vertex set of T , let X denote the subgraph of T induced
by F , let X1, . . . , XN denote its connected components, and let Fi denote the vertex set of
Xi, for i ∈ {1, . . . , N}. We claim that

|∂F| ≥ (d − 2)|F| + 2.

Assume ﬁrst that X is connected. We proceed by induction on |F|. If |F| = 1, then
|∂F| ≥ d = (d − 2)|F| + 2 and the claim is obvious. Assume now that |F| = k ≥ 2; let
y ∈ F be a vertex of X-degree 1, and let Y be the subgraph of X induced by F \{y}. One
has

|∂F| ≥ |∂(F \ {y})| + d − 2 ∗≥ (d − 2)(cid:0)|F| − 1(cid:1) + 2 + d − 2 = (d − 2)|F| + 2

≥ holds because of the induction hypothesis.

where ∗
(It is easy to check that |∂F| =
(d − 2)|F| + 2 in case T = T (d).)
Assume now that X has N ≥ 2 connected components, and proceed by induction on N.
As T is a tree, one may assume the enumeration of the Fi ’s such that ∂F1 has at most
one vertex in common with ∂(cid:0)S2≤i≤N Fi(cid:1). Then
(cid:12)(cid:12)∂F(cid:12)(cid:12) ≥ |∂F1| +(cid:12)(cid:12)∂(cid:16) [2≤i≤N
where ∗∗≥ holds because of the induction hypothesis.
It follows that ι(T ) ≥ d − 2, with equality for a d-regular tree.
Recall that a hanging chain of length k in a graph X is a path of length k (with k + 1
vertices, k − 1 so-called inner ones and the two end-vertices) with all inner vertices of
degree 2 in X. It is obvious that, if X has hanging chains of arbitrarily large lengths, then
ι(X) = 0. The following is a kind of converse, for trees.

Fi(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12) − 1 ∗∗≥ (d−2)|F1|+2+(d−2)

|Fi|+2−1 > (d−2)|F|+2

k be an integer, k ≥ 2.

If T has no hanging chain of length > k, then

ι(T ) ≥

.

Also ι(T ) = 0 if and only if T has arbitrarily long hanging chains.

Proof: see the proof of Corollary 4.2 in [DeSS].

(cid:3)

Other interesting estimates of isoperimetric constants appear, for example, in Section 4

of [McM1].

49. Deﬁnitions. On a locally ﬁnite graph X, there is a natural simple random walk
with corresponding Markov operator T . Suppose for simplicity that X is connected and of
bounded degree. Consider the Hilbert space ℓ2(X 0, deg) of functions h from X 0 to C such

that Px∈X 0 deg(x)|h(x)|2 < ∞, and the bounded self-adjoint operator T deﬁned on this

Hilbert space by

for h ∈ ℓ2(X 0, deg), x ∈ X 0, where y ∼ x indicates a summation over the neighbours y of
the vertex x. The spectral radius of X is

ρ(X) = sup(cid:8)hh|T hi(cid:12)(cid:12) h ∈ ℓ2(X 0, deg) , khk2 ≤ 1(cid:9)
= sup(cid:8)|λ| (cid:12)(cid:12) λ is in the spectrum of T (cid:9) .

Observe that 1 − T is a natural analogue on X of a Laplacian, so that 1 − ρ(X) is often
referred to as the ﬁrst eigenvalue of the Laplacian or (more appropriately) as the bottom
of its spectrum.

It is also known that, for a real number λ, the following are equivalent:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

there exists F : X 0 →]0,∞[

such that

there exists F : X 0 →]0,∞[
one has λ ≥ ρ(X),

such that

deg(x)Xy∼x

1

F (y) = λF (x),

F (y) ≤ λF (x),

so that (i) and (ii) indicate alternative deﬁnitions of the spectral radius.
In terms of
the Laplace operator, (i) and (ii) are respectively conditions about (1 − λ)-harmonic and
(1 − λ)-superharmonic functions. (For a proof in terms of graphs, see Proposition 1.5 in
[DoKa]. But there are earlier proofs in the literature on irreducible stationary discrete
Markov chains. The equivalence of (ii) and (iii) is standard; the equivalence with (i) is
more delicate: [Harr] and [Pru].)

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

For x, y ∈ X 0 and for an integer n ≥ 0, denote by p(n)(x, y) the probability that a simple

random walk starting at x is at y after n steps. Then one has also

ρ(X) = lim sup
n→∞

nqp(n)(x, y);

in particular, the value of this lim sup is independent on x and y. From this probabilistic
interpretation of ρ(X), one deduces easily that, for a connected graph X which is regular

of degree d ≥ 2, one has ρ(X) ≥ 2√d − 1/d; equality holds if and only if X is a tree.
(More generally, for any transition kernel p : X 0 × X 0 → [0,∞[ with reversible measure
µ : X 0 →]0,∞[, so that Pz∈X 0 p(x, z) = 1 and µ(x)p(x, y) = p(y, x)µ(y) for all x, y ∈ X 0,
one introduces the Hilbert space ℓ2(X 0, µ), and the self-adjoint operator T deﬁned by the
kernel p on ℓ2(X 0, µ). Then the norm of T is again equal to lim supn→∞

npp(n)(x, y).)

d ≥ 2, one has

ι(X) ≥ 4

Proof. Let X1 denote the set of oriented edges of X. (If X is ﬁnite, the cardinal of X1 is
twice the number of geometric edges of X.) Each e ∈ X1 has a head e+ ∈ X 0 and a tail
e− ∈ X 0. For a function h ∈ ℓ2(X 0, deg) with real values, one has
h(x)Xy∼x
hh|T hi = Xx∈X 0
Let now F be a ﬁnite non-empty subset of X 0, with boundary ∂F . Consider the function
h ∈ ℓ2(X 0, deg) deﬁned by

The previous lemma appears in several places (see No 51 below). It is related to Theorem
3.1 of [BiMS], which is stated in terms of the constant ι∗(X) of our Item 46, and which
shows that ι∗(X) ≥ 4(1−ρ(X)). Recently, T. Smirnova-Nagnibeda has improved the latter
to

ι∗(X) ≥

(1 − ρ(X))

d2
d − 1

(the improvement comes from choosing a test-function, playing the role of the function h
in the proof above, which is more eﬃcient than the one chosen in [BiMS]).

For a majoration of ι(X) in terms of 1 − ρ(X) and d (namely for an analogue of the
“Cheeger’s inequality”), see Theorem 2.3 in [Dod] or Theorem 3.2 in [BiMS] (in each case
with normalizations diﬀerent from ours).

51. Theorem. Let X be a connected graph which is of bounded degree. The following are
equivalent:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

X is paradoxical

(see Deﬁnition 44),

ι(X) > 0

(see Deﬁnition 45),

ρ(X) < 1
p(n)(x, y) = o(σn)

(see Deﬁnition 49),
for some σ ∈]0, 1[ and for all x, y ∈ X 0

and they imply that

(v)

the simple random walk on X is transient.

On the proof. The equivalence (i) ⇐⇒ (ii) is a reformulation of Theorem 25 on the Følner
condition.
The equivalence (ii) ⇐⇒ (iii) may be viewed as a discrete analogue of the Cheeger-
Buser inequalities for Riemannian manifolds [Che], [Bus]. For graphs as in the present
theorem, it can be found in [Dod], [Var], [DoKe], [DoKa], [Ger], [Anc], [Kai1]; there are
also similar arguments showing appropriate estimates for ﬁnite graphs in several papers by
Alon et alii, quoted in [Lub] (in particular near Propositions 4.2.4 and 4.2.5).

notes on Networks [Soa].

For (iii) ⇐⇒ (iv) and for equivalence with other conditions, see Theorem 4.27 in Soardi’s
The implication (iii) =⇒ (v) is obvious.
For groups, the equivalence

amenability

⇐⇒

ρ(X) = 1

goes back to the pioneering papers of Kesten [Kes1], [Kes2]. See also [Day3] and the review
in [Woe].
(cid:3)

There are other conditions equivalent to (i) to (iv) above, for example in terms of norms

of Markov operators on ℓp-spaces; see [Kai1].

For locally ﬁnite graphs which are not necessarily of bounded degree, one has to modify
some of the deﬁnitions above. Thus, for a ﬁnite set F of vertices of a graph X, one considers
the sum kFk of the degrees of the vertices in F , the number k∂Fk of edges with one end in
F and the other end outside F , and the inﬁmum ˜ι(X) of the quotients k∂Fk/kFk (compare
with Deﬁnition 45). For graphs of bounded degree, one has ˜ι(X) = 0 ⇐⇒ ι(X) = 0, but
in general5 on may have ˜ι(X) = 0 and ι(X) > 0. By a particular case of a result of
Kaimanovich (Theorem 5.1 in [Kai1]), one has ˜ι(X) > 0 ⇐⇒ ρ(X) < 1.

Graphs of unbounded degree are also covered by the arguments in [DoKa] and [DoKe].

Graphs give rise to several kinds of algebras, and it is a natural question in each case to
ask how the properties of Theorem 51 translate. For Gromov’s translation algebras (see the
end of 8.C2 in [Gro3]), there is a hint in [Ele1]. For other algebras associated with graphs
(and more generally with oriented graphs), see [KPRR] and [KPR]. Amenable properties
of certain kind of graphs (more precisely of bipartite graphs with appropriate weights) are
also important in the study of subfactors; see various works by S. Popa, including [Pop1]
and [Pop2].

Amenability has of course been one of the most important notions in the theory of
operator algebras since the works of von Neumann. We will not discuss more of this here,
but only refer to [Co2] and [Hel].

5Here is an example shown to us by Vadim Kaimanovich. Let (hj)j≥1 be a sequence of integers, all at

least 2, and consider ﬁrst a rooted tree Y in which a vertex at distance n of the root is of degree

IV. Estimates of Tarski numbers

IV.1. From relative growth to Tarski number of paradoxical

decompositions

Let G be a ﬁnitely generated group, given as a quotient

of the free group Fm on m generators s1, . . . , sm, for some m ≥ 1. The purpose of the
present section is to review notions which will be used in IV.2.

π : Fm −→ G

52. Recall: relative growth, spectral radius and isoperimetric constant. Let
ℓ : Fm → N denote the word length on Fm with respect to s1, . . . , sm. For each integer
k ≥ 0, let σ(ker(π), k) denote the cardinality of the set { w ∈ ker(π)| ℓ(w) = k }. The
relative growth of ker(π) (some authors say “the cogrowth of G”!) is, by deﬁnition,

αker(π) = lim sup

k→∞

kpσ(ker(π), k).

If ker(π) 6= {1}, it is easy to check that √2m − 1 ≤ αker(π) ≤ 2m − 1, and one shows
more precisely that √2m − 1 < αker(π), see [Gri1].

The corresponding Cayley graph (with vertex set G and with an edge between two

vertices x, y if and only if ℓ(xy−1) = 1) has a spectral radius given by the formula

√2m − 1

proof of Theorem 51. (In the present setting for the formula giving ρ as a function of α,

one has 1 ≤ α ≤ √2m − 1 if and only if α = 1, if and only if ker(π) = {1}; but the formula
range 1 ≤ α ≤ √2m − 1 is meaningful.)

makes sense and is correct for subgroups of Fm which need not be normal, and then the

Isoperimetric constant and doubling characteristic distance. Let X be a
53.
graph, with its set X 0 of vertices viewed as a metric space for the combinatorial distance
d as in Section III.2. A doubling characteristic distance for X is (if it exists) an integer K
for which the doubling condition of Deﬁnition 30 holds, namely an integer K such that

|NK(F )| ≥ 2|F|

30

for any non-empty ﬁnite subset F of X 0. If the isoperimetric constant ι(X) of Deﬁnition
45 is strictly positive, the integer

KX = (cid:24)

log 2

log(1 + ι(X))(cid:25)

is clearly a doubling characteristic distance, where ⌈t⌉ indicates the least integer larger
than or equal to t.

54. Proposition. Let X be a graph with isoperimetric constant ι(X) > 0; deﬁne KX
as in the previous paragraph. Then there exists a paradoxical decomposition involving a
partition X 0 = X 0
j → X 0 in
W(X 0) such that

55. Four functions. Let m be an integer, m ≥ 2.
For α ∈]√2m − 1, 2m − 1], set ρm(α) =

Observe that α 7→ ρm(α) and K 7→ bm(K) are increasing, while ρ 7→ ι(ρ) and ι 7→ K(ι) are
decreasing. Observe also that, in the Cayley graph of a group G with respect to a set of m
generators, a ball of radius K has at most bm(K) elements, and precisely bm(K) elements

56. Theorem. Let G = Fm/N be a group given as a quotient of the free group on m
generators by a normal subgroup N 6= {1}. Let αG denote the corresponding relative growth
and let ι(X) denote the isoperimetric constant of the corresponding Cayley graph X (see
Deﬁnition 45 and Item 52). Using the notation of the previous number, one has:

(i) if αG ≤ α for some α ≤ 2m − 1, the Tarski number of G satisﬁes

T (G) ≤ 2bm(cid:18)K(cid:16)ι (ρm(α))(cid:17)(cid:19),

(ii) if ι(X) ≥ ι for some ι ≥ 0, then

T (G) ≤ 2bm(cid:0)K(ι)(cid:1).

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

Proof. For (i), one has ι(X) ≥ ι (ρm(α)) by the formula of Item 52 and by the isoperimetric
inequality of Lemma 50, and this implies KX ≤ K (ι (ρm(α))). If φj : X 0
j → X 0 are as in
Proposition 54, one may write X 0

j as a ﬁnite disjoint union of the sets

Aj,g = (cid:8)x ∈ X 0

j | φj(x) = gx(cid:9)

for g in the ball BG(KX) = {g ∈ G | ℓ(g) ≤ KX} (compare with Observation 9), this for
j = 1 and j = 2. As |BG(KX)| ≤ bm(KX), this ends the proof of (i). The end of the
argument shows also (ii).

(cid:3)

57. Comments and examples. Observe that we have argued with the Cayley graph
of G related to the right-invariant distance d(x, y) = ℓ (xy−1) on G, so that the left-
multiplications x 7→ gx are bounded perturbations of the identity.

Let us now test the inequalities of Theorem 56.
(i) Let F2 denote the free group of rank 2 and let X denote the Cayley graph of F2 with
respect to some free basis (X is of course a regular tree of degree 4). Kesten [Kes1] has
√3
2 ≈
computed the spectral value of the corresponding simple random walk as ρ(X) =
log(1.6188)m = 2 is a doubling
0.86603 so that ι(X) ≥ 4 1−ρ(X)
characteristic distance. The resulting estimate

log 2

ρ(X) ≈ 0.6188. Hence KX = l
T (F2) ≤ 2|BF2(2)| = 2(cid:0)2.32 − 1(cid:1) = 34

compares rather badly with the correct value T (F2) = 4.
A similar computation with the Cayley graph Y of F3 with respect to a free basis gives
√5
3 ≈ 0.7454, so that ι(Y ) ≥ 1.366. Hence K = 1 is a doubling characteristic
ρ(Y ) =
distance. Consequently T (F3) ≤ 2|BF3(1)| = 14. As F3 is a subgroup of F2 one may
improve the previous estimate to

by Observation 19.

T (F2) ≤ 14

(ii) Consider again the Cayley graph X of F2.

Its isoperimetric constant is precisely

distance; thus

ι(X) = deg(X)−2 = 2 by Example 47. Hence KX =l log 2
T (F2) ≤ 2|BF2(1)| = 10,

log 3m = 1 is a doubling characteristic

which compares better than the previous estimate with T (F2) = 4.

These computations indicate that some eﬀort should be given to sharpen the isoperi-

metric inequality of Lemma 50 used above (see Question 62.(a)).

IV.2. Tarski number for Ol’shanskii groups and for Burnside groups

58. On Ol’shanskii groups. We consider ﬁrst a family of groups investigated in [Ol1].
(See also [Ol2] both for this family and for other ones, discovered by the same author, and

32

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

relevant for the subject discussed here.) For any ǫ > 0, there exists one of these groups
given as a quotient π : F2 ։ G for which the relative growth αG satisﬁes

√3 < αG ≤

√3 + ǫ

and which is consequently non-amenable. Moreover Ol’shanskii has shown that these
groups do not have any non-abelian free subgroups; thus their Tarski number satisfy
T (G) ≥ 5, and T (G) ≥ 6 in case of torsion groups (Proposition 21). From the rela-
tive growth extimate above and from Theorem 56 (see also the ﬁrst computation of Item
57), one obtains the following.

59. Proposition. There exists a two-generator non-amenable torsion-free group G with-
out non-abelian free subgroup, for which the Tarski number T (G) satisﬁes

5 ≤ T (G) ≤ 34.

There exist a two-generator non-amenable torsion group G, with all proper subgroups cyclic,
for which

(The constructions of these groups are due to Ol’shanskii.)

6 ≤ T (G) ≤ 34.

60. On Burnside groups. We consider next the Burnside group B(m, n), given as
the quotient of the free group Fm of rank m ≥ 2 by the normal subgroup generated by
{xn}x∈Fm, for an odd integer n ≥ 665. It is obvious that B(m, n) does not contain any
free group not reduced to {1}. It is known that B(m, n) is inﬁnite, indeed of exponential
growth (see VI.2.16 in [Ady1]), and indeed not amenable [Ady2].
From Theorem 3 and the last but one line in6 [Ady2], one has the relative growth estimate

α ≤ (2m − 1)

Let m1, m2 be such that 2 ≤ m1 ≤ m2 ≤ ∞ and let n be as above. It follows from general
principles on relatively free groups in varieties of groups that B(m2, n) has a subgroup
isomorphic to B(m1, n); see [NeuH], Statements 12.62 and 13.41. It is also known that
B(m1, n) has a subgroup isomorphic to B(m2, n); see [Sir], and also § 35.2 in [Ol2]. Thus,
it follows from Observation 10 that one has T(cid:0)B(m, n)(cid:1) = T(cid:0)B(3, n)(cid:1) for any m ≥ 2.
61. Theorem. For m ≥ 2 and for n odd and at least 665, the Tarski number of the
Burnside group B(m, n) satisﬁes

This and Proposition 21 show the following.

6 ≤ T(cid:0)B(m, n)(cid:1) ≤ 14.

Let us mention that it is unknown whether, for n large, B(m, n) has inﬁnite amenable
quotients. (A question of Stepin, which is Problem 9.7 of [Kou].) Similarly, one could ask
what are the Tarski numbers of non-amenable quotients of these groups.

62. Questions of continuity.

ρ(X) of Lemma 50?

Question (a): given ǫ > 0, does there exist δ > 0 such that, for any quotient group G
of a free group F with spectral radius satisfying ρ(G) < ρ(F ) + δ, one has necessarily an
estimate ι(G) > ι(F )− ǫ for the isoperimetric constants ? More generally, can one sharpen
the inequality ι(X) ≥ 4 1−ρ(X)
Question (b): given δ > 0, does there exist η > 0 such that, for any quotient group G of
a free group F with minimal growth rate satisfying ω(G) > ω(F ) − η, one has necessarily
an estimate ρ(G) < ρ(F ) + δ?
(For ω(G), see [GriH]. If the free group F above is of rank m and is considered together
m , and ι(F ) = 2m − 2. The
with a free basis, recall that ω(F ) = 2m − 1, ρ(F ) =
coeﬃcients ρ(G) and ι(G) are of course taken with respect to the images in G of free
generators in F .)

√2m−1

Assume the two questions above have aﬃrmative answers; then: (i) for a convenient
group G of Ol’shanskii, ι(G) ≥ 2− ǫ, and K = 1, and consequently T (G) ≤ 10; (ii) for the
Burnside groups B(2, n) of Theorem 61 with n large enough, one would have ω(G) ≥ 3− ǫ
(VI.2.16 in [Ady1]), and K = 1, and consequently also T(cid:0)B(m, n)(cid:1) = T(cid:0)B(2, n)(cid:1) ≤ 10
for any m ≥ 2 and n odd large enough.

V. Supramenability

V.1. Supramenability and subexponential growth

63. Deﬁnition. A pseudogroup (G, X) is supramenable if the pseudogroup (G(A), A) de-
ﬁned in Example 2.(iv) is amenable for any nonempty subset A of X.

In case of a pseudogroup W(X), Remark 3.(vi) shows that one may read this deﬁnition
in two ways. More precisely, a locally ﬁnite metric space X is supramenable if, for any
subspace A of X, one has

34

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

or equivalently

(i) the metric space A is amenable, i.e. the pseudogroup W(A) is amenable,
(ii) the restriction W(X)(A) of the pseudogroup W(X) to A is amenable.

Observe that supramenability of uniformly locally ﬁnite metric spaces is invariant by quasi-
isometry, because of Proposition 38.

A ﬁnitely generated group is supramenable if it so as a metric space, for the combinatorial
distance on its Cayley graph with respect to a ﬁnite generating set (this deﬁnition of
supramenability does not depend on the choice of the generating set).

This notion, due to Rosenblatt [Ros2], carries over to not necessarily ﬁnitely generated

groups, and indeed to topological groups, but we will not use this below.

64. Deﬁnition. Let X be a locally ﬁnite metric space; for a point x ∈ X and a number
r ≥ 0, we denote by βX
x (r) the cardinality of the closed ball of radius r around x in X. The
space X is of

subexponential growth if

exponential growth if

1 < lim sup

r→∞

r→∞

x (r) = 1

x (r) < ∞
x (r) = ∞.

Observe7 that any of these holds for some x ∈ X if and only if it holds for all x ∈ X, and
also if and only if it holds for any pair (X′, x′) with X′ quasi-isometric to X. In particular,
subexponential growth and exponential growth make sense for ﬁnitely generated groups,
without any mention of a generating set.

65. Lemma. Inside a locally ﬁnite metric space of subexponential growth, any subspace
is also of subexponential growth.

Proof. For a subspace Y of a space X, one may choose in the previous deﬁnition the point
x inside Y . Then the lemma follows from the obvious inequality βY
x (r), for all
r ≥ 0.
(cid:3)

x (r) ≤ βX

For historical perspective, let us recall that a simple argument going back to [AdVS]
shows that a ﬁnitely generated group which is of subexponential growth is amenable, and
indeed supramenable (Theorem 4.6 in [Ros2]).

As a consequence, one has ι(X) = 0 for any Cayley graph X of a ﬁnitely generated group
of subexponential growth. There are further connections between growth and isoperimetry,
due to Varopoulos and others. More precisely, consider for example a ﬁnitely generated
group G generated by a ﬁnite set S, the corresponding growth function βG
βG
S (n) = | { g ∈ G| the S-word length of g is at most n }|

S deﬁned by

relating the growth function βG

and [PiSa].

S and the isoperimetric proﬁle I G

In our context, the argument of [AdVS] provides the following result.

66. Theorem. A locally ﬁnite metric space of subexponential growth is supramenable.
Proof. Let X be a locally ﬁnite metric space of subexponential growth. By the previous
lemma, it is enough to show that X is amenable; we will show that X satisﬁes the Følner
condition.

Consider a ﬁnite subset R in the pseudogroup W(X), a point x0 ∈ X and a number

so that (Fk)k≥1 is a “Følner sequence” (see Deﬁnition 23), and this ends the proof.

(cid:3)

The following criterium for graphs will be used in Section V.2. Recall that a metric
space X is long-range connected if there is a constant C > 0 such that every two points x
and y in X can be joined by a ﬁnite chain of points

x0 = x , x1 , . . . , xn = y

such that

for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n} (see Item 0.2-A2 in [Gro3]).

d(xi−1, xi) ≤ C

36

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

67. Proposition. A connected locally ﬁnite graph is supramenable if and only if all its
long-range connected subgraphs are amenable.
Proof of the non-trivial implication. Given a graph X which is not supramenable, we have
to show that there exists a long-range connected subset Z of its vertex set X 0 which is not
amenable (as a metric space, for the combinatorial distance of X).

By hypothesis, there exists a subset Y of X 0 and a mapping φ : Y → Y such that
supy∈Y d(φ(y), y) ≤ C for some constant C ≥ 0, and such that |φ−1(y)| ≥ 2 for all y ∈ Y .
Set Z = NC(Y ), and let (Zi)i∈I be an enumeration of the connected components of Z.
For all i ∈ I, set Yi = Y ∩ Zi. As φ is a C-bounded perturbation of the identity, one has
φ−1(Yi) ⊂ Zi, and it follows that φ−1(Yi) ⊂ Yi, for all i ∈ I. Hence Yi is paradoxical for
each i ∈ I.

(cid:3)

V.2. Examples with trees

Let S2 denote the free semigroup on two generators. From the natural word length, one
deﬁnes on S2 a metric making it a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space which is of expo-
nential growth, and indeed paradoxical. Thus, any ﬁnitely generated group containing a
subsemigroup isomorphic to S2 has a paradoxical subspace (the group being viewed as a
metric space), and consequently is not supramenable.

68. Question. Does there exist a ﬁnitely generated group which is amenable, not supra-
menable, and without subsemigroup isomorphic to S2 ?

This question is due to Rosenblatt, who conjectured the answer to be negative (see [Ros2],
just after Theorem 4.6 and after Corollary 4.20); he also observed the following alternative
for a ﬁnitely generated solvable group: either the group has a nilpotent subgroup of ﬁnite
index, and then the group is supramenable, or the group contains S2 as a subsemigroup,
and then the group is not supramenable (Theorems 4.7 and 4.12 in [Ros2]).

However, Question 68 has been answered positively by the second author as follows.

69. Examples [Gri4]. For each prime p, there exist uncountably many ﬁnitely generated
p-groups which are

• of exponential growth,
• without any subsemigroup isomorphic to S2,
• amenable,
• not supramenable.

On the proof. This involves wreath products8 G = Cp ≀ H, where Cp denotes a cyclic
group of order p and where H is one of the p-groups of intermediate growth constructed
in [Gri2, Gri3].

To show that G is not supramenable, the idea is to construct a paradoxical binary subtree
in an appropriate Cayley graph of G. As a torsion group, G does not contain S2. The two
other claims are straightforward.

translated as “amalgamated product”!

70. Question. Does there exist a ﬁnitely generated group which is supramenable and of
exponential growth ?

This question, formulated as Item 12.9.a and Problem C.12 of [Wag], is still open.
One way to make the question more precise is recorded as Problem 16.11 in the Kourovka
Notebook [Kou]: does there exist a ﬁnitely generated semigroup S with cancellation having
subexponential growth and such that the group of left quotients G = S−1S has exponential
growth? (The group of quotients would exist, because the so-called “Ore condition” holds;
see for example Sections 1.10 and 12.4 in [ClPr].) The point is that such a semigroup of
subexponential growth is supramenable and that a group of quotients of a supramenable
semigroup is a supramenable group.

Here is however a straightforward construction.

71. Example. There exists a locally ﬁnite metric space which is of superexponential
growth and which is supramenable.
Proof. Consider a sequence (dk)k≥0 of integers ≥ 2 and a sequence (hk)k≥1 of integers ≥ 1.
Let X be a rooted tree in which a vertex at distance n of the root is of degree

If lim inf k→∞ hk = ∞, a long-range connected subspace Y of the vertex set of X cannot
satisfy the Gromov condition (compare with Proposition 35 above, i.e. with Corollary 4.2
of [DeSS]). It follows from Proposition 67 that X is supramenable.

Now the growth sequence of X with respect to the root, say x0, satisﬁes

k

so that, if the sequence (dk)k≥0 is increasing rapidly enough, one has

72. Variation on the previous example. There exists a graph of bounded degree which
is of exponential growth and which is supramenable.

2 if (k − 1)k ≤ n < k2 for some k ≥ 1,
3 if k2 ≤ n < k(k + 1) for some k ≥ 1.

The growth function of X with respect to the root satisﬁes

for all k ≥ 1, so that X is clearly of exponential growth. Example 48 implies that X is
supramenable.

73. Question. Let G and H be two ﬁnitely generated groups which are supramenable; is
the product G × H supramenable ?

This question appears in [Ros2] (just before Proposition 4.21), and the answer is still

unknown. Here is however an example, for which we are grateful to Laurent Bartholdi.

74. Example. There exist two supramenable locally ﬁnite metric spaces X, Y such that
the direct product X × Y is not supramenable, for the metric deﬁned by
dX×Y(cid:0)(x1, y1), (x2, y2)(cid:1) = dX(x1, x2) + dY (y1, y2).

j=0 hj = 0 for k = 0). And let Y be a rooted tree in which a vertex at distance n

(with P2k

of the root is of degree

Observe that both X and Y are supramenable, because each of their inﬁnite connected
subgraphs has arbitrarily large hanging chains. Observe also that, for each integer n, there
is either in X or in Y a vertex of degree 3 at distance n of the relevant root. It follows that
the product of the two metric spaces deﬁned by X and Y , for the distance dX×Y deﬁned
above, contains a paradoxical tree. Consequently, X × Y is not supramenable.

75. Paradoxical subtrees in paradoxical graphs.
It is known that a paradoxical
graph contains a paradoxical tree [BeSc]. It is unknown whether a connected paradoxical
graph necessarily contains a paradoxical tree which is spanning, i.e. which contains all
vertices of the original graph (this is Problem 2 in Section 4 of [DeSS]).

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

However, Benjamini and Schramm have shown that, if X is a paradoxical graph with
ι(X) ≥ n for some integer n ≥ 2, then X has a spanning forest of which every connected
component is a tree with one vertex of degree n − 1 and all other vertices of degree n + 1.
This implies that X has a paradoxical spanning tree.

76. A question of V. Troﬁmov. This appears as Problem 12.87 in the Kourovka
Notebook [Kou]. Let X be a connected undirected graph without loops and multiple edges
and suppose that its automorphism group Aut(X) acts transitively on the vertices. Is it
true that one of the following holds?

(i) the stabilizer of a vertex of X is ﬁnite,
(ii) the action of Aut(X) on the vertices of X admits a non-trivial imprimitivity system σ
with ﬁnite blocks for which the stabilizer of a vertex of the factor-graph X/σ in Aut(X/σ)
is ﬁnite,

(iii) there exists a natural number n such that the graph, obtained from X by adding
edges connecting distinct vertices the distance between which in X is at most n, contains
a tree all of whose vertices have valence 3.

If the answer to this question was positive, this would imply that a graph of subexpo-
nential growth having a transitive group of automorphisms is essentially a Cayley graph
of a group.

VI. Comments and corrections (March 2016)

On the article by Deuber, Simonovits and S´os, and their terminology of expo-
nential growth. There is an annotated version of the 1995 version, dated 2004 [DeSS–04],
and an exposition of related material [ElSo–05]. In the annotated version, the authors ob-
serve that their terminology of exponential growth is not standard in the group theory
literature.

On No. 11 and elementary amenable groups. Let B0 denote the class consisting of
all ﬁnite groups and the inﬁnite cyclic group. The following fact was shown by Chou and
reﬁned by Osin [Osin–02, Theorem 2.1]: the class EG of elementary amenable groups is
the smallest class of groups which contains the trivial group {1}, which is closed under
taking direct limits, and which is such that a group G is in EG whenever there exists an
extension {1} → N → G → Q → {1} with N ∈ EG and Q ∈ B0.

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

45

Nekrashevych [Nekr] has recently discovered examples of ﬁnitely generated inﬁnite groups
that are simple, periodic, and of intermediate growth. In particular they are amenable (be-
cause of intermediate growth) and not elementary amenable (either because inﬁnite ﬁnitely
generated simple groups cannot be elementary amenable, or because inﬁnite ﬁnitely gen-
erated periodic groups cannot be elementary amenable – both observations go back to
Chou).

On No. 13 and the space of marked groups. The space of marked groups has
received a considerable amount of attention. Besides the articles cited in No. 13, we
indicate [ChGu–05], [CoGP–07], and [BCGS–14].

See also [WeWi, Corollary 6.25] for an original proof of the existence of ﬁnitely generated
groups that are amenable and are not elementary amenable: in the appropriate space of
marked groups, the set of amenable groups is Borel and the set of elementary amenable
groups is not.

On No. 14 and subexponentially amenable groups. There are amenable groups
(i.e. groups in AG) that are not subexponentially amenable (i.e. not in BG). Indeed, the
so-called Basilica group was ﬁrst shown to be not in BG [GrZu–02], and later shown to be
amenable [BaVi–05]. The method of Bartholdi and Virag was streamlined and generalized
in [Kaim–05]. Further examples can be found in [Ersc–06], [Brie–09], [BaKN–10]. The
ﬁnitely generated amenable simple groups that appear in [JuMo–13] are also amenable
and not subexponentially amenable.

On Nos. 15 and 24, Ahlfors’ notion of regular exhaustion, and Bogolyubov’s
ideas on amenability for topological groups. In [Roe–88], there is a discussion of
regular exhaustion, introduced by Ahlfors in 1935 [Ahl]. In [GrHa], there is a discussion of
Bogolyubov’s ideas on amenability, in his 1939 article [BogL] which went almost unnoticed.
There is an exposition of basic material on amenability of topological groups (and the

important case of locally compact groups) in Chapter II.G of [BeHV–08].

On No. 15, amenability of groups and cellular automata. Let G be a group and
A a ﬁnite set. Equip AG = {u : G → A} with its prodiscrete topology (i.e. the topology
of pointwise convergence) and with the shift action of G deﬁned by gu(h) := u(g−1h) for
all g, h ∈ G and u ∈ AG. A cellular automaton over G is a continuous map τ : AG → AG
that is G-equivariant, i.e., satisﬁes τ (gu) = gτ (u) for all g ∈ G and u ∈ AG. For two maps
u, v ∈ AG write u ≈ v if they coincide outside of a ﬁnite subset of G. It is clear that ≈
is an equivalence relation. A map τ : AG → AG is said to be pre-injective if its restriction
to each ≈-equivalence class is injective. Then the Garden of Eden theorem [CeMS–99]
(see also [Gro–99b]), originally established by Moore [Moo–63] and Myhill [Myh–63] for
G = Z, states that a cellular automaton over an amenable group is surjective if and only
if it is pre-injective. It follows from[Bart–10] that if a group G is non-amenable then there
exist cellular automata over G that are surjective but not pre-injective. Thus, the Garden
of Eden theorem yields a characterization of amenability for groups in terms of cellular
automata. For more on the Garden of Eden theorem (consequences and variations) we
refer to [CeCo–10].

46

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

On No. 17, inner amenability, and coamenability. An old question on inner amenabil-
ity from [Eﬀ] has been solved in [Vaes–12].

Several claims of Theorem 5 in [BeHa] have to be corrected, as in [Stal–06, Section 3].
For the notion of coamenability of a subgroup of a group, see also [MoPo–03] and

[Pest–03].

On Deﬁnition 18, Question 22, and Tarski numbers. There are other deﬁnitions
of Tarski numbers, see [ErSP–15, Appendix A]. Since 1999, there has been some progress
on understanding of Tarski numbers. For example, there are 2-generated non-amenable
groups with arbitrarily large Tarski numbers, there are groups which we know have Tarski
number exactly 5, or 6, and every number τ ≥ 4 is the Tarski number of some faithful
transitive action of a ﬁnitely generated free group. See [OzSa–13], [ErSP–15], [Gola–a],
and [Gola–b].

On Deﬁnition 29 and the reference [GrLP]. In its second edition, this book has been
considerably expanded [Gro–99a].

On Deﬁnition 30 and the terminology “doubling condition”.
It is unfortunate
that this terminology is used in several incompatible meanings. Some authors use them in
our sense, see e.g. [Kapo–02]. But many more authors use them in a completely diﬀerent
meaning, most often for metric spaces with measures, and occasionally for metric spaces
as such; see e.g. [Gro–99a], [Hein–01] and [LoVi–07].

More precisely, a metric space X is called doubling if there exists a constant C > 0 such
that, for all d > 0, any subset of X of diameter at most d can be covered by C subsets of
X of diametrer at most d/2 [Hein–01, Deﬁnition 10.13]. The doubling metric spaces are
precisely the spaces of ﬁnite Assouad dimension; compare [Hein–01, Deﬁnition 10.15].

In retrospect, our terminology for the notion of Deﬁntion 30 was unfortunate.
A change of terminology there should have some eﬀect on the terminology “doubling

characteristic distance” of No. 53.

On Section III.1, discrete and locally ﬁnite metric spaces, and uniform notions.
In the published version, just before Deﬁntion 28, we have unfortunately used the word
“discrete” for what should be “locally ﬁnite”.

For a metric space (X, d), the four following properties should not be confused:

x, y ∈ X such that x 6= y;

• (X, d) is discrete if, for every x ∈ X, there exists δx > 0 such that d(x, y) ≥ δx
for all y ∈ X r {x}; note that (X, d) is discrete if and only if the topology on
X deﬁned by d is discrete;
• (X, d) is uniformly discrete if there exists δ > 0 such that d(x, y) ≥ δ for all
• (X, d) is locally ﬁnite if every subset of X of ﬁnite diameter is ﬁnite;
• (X, d) is uniformly locally ﬁnite if, for every D ≥ 0, there exists a constant C
such that every subset of X of diameter at most D has at most C elements.
Note that a discrete metric space is locally ﬁnite if and only if it is proper, i.e. if and only
if its closed balls are compact. Note also that a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric space need
not be uniformly discrete (example: the subspace {n ∈ Z | n ≥ 1} ∪ {n + 2−n | n ≥ 1} of

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

47

the real line). Let X be a connected graph, and (X 0, d) its vertex set together with the
combinatorial distance function; then X 0 is always uniformly discrete, and X 0 is locally
ﬁnite [respectively uniformly locally ﬁnite] if and only if X is locally ﬁnite [respectively of
bounded degree].

In the present version (unlike in the published version), we have used “locally ﬁnite”
instead of “discrete” in Nos. 28 to 36. Proposition 38, on invariance of amenability by
quasi-isometries, holds for uniformly locally ﬁnite metric spaces.

An example in [DiMW]. Here is the last example of [DiMW], showing that the hypothesis
of uniform local ﬁniteness cannot be deleted in Proposition 38.

Consider the graph X deﬁned as follows:

· it has vertices (n, 1) for all n ∈ Z with n ≥ −1,
and (n, k) for all n ≥ 1 and k ∈ N such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2n;
· it has edges connecting (n, 1) to (n + 1, 1) for all n ∈ Z with n ≥ −1,
and (n, 1) to (n, k) for all n ≥ 1 and k ∈ N such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2n.

Observe that X is locally ﬁnite and not uniformly locally ﬁnite. Denote by X 0 the vertex
set of this graph, considered as a metric space for the combinatorial metric, say d; observe
that X 0 is a uniformly discrete metric space. Let Φ : X 0 7−→ X 0 be the mapping deﬁned
as follows:

· Φ(−1, 1) = Φ(0, 1) = (−1, 1);
· Φ(n, k) = Φ(n, k + 2n−1) = (n − 1, k) for all n ≥ 1 and k with 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n−1.
Then Φ is a bounded perturbation of the identity and all its ﬁbers have two elements, in
other terms

d(Φ(x), x) ≤ 3 and |Φ−1(x)| = 2 for all x ∈ X 0.

Hence X 0 satisﬁes the Gromov condition of Deﬁnition 29, and X 0 is paradoxical by Theo-
rem 32. Consider also the subgraph of this graph with vertex set Y 0 = {(n, 1) | n ∈ Z, n ≥
−1} and edges connecting (n, 1) to (n + 1, 1) for all n ∈ Z with n ≥ −1; observe that this
graph is a half line, and that the corresponding discrete metric space Y is amenable.
There is an obvious quasi-isometry from X 0 to Y 0, that maps (n, k) to (n, 1) for all

(n, k) ∈ X 0. Yet X 0 is paradoxical and Y 0 amenable.
On metric spaces for which amenability could make sense. Logically, Deﬁnitions
28, 29, 30 would make sense for every metric space. In Theorem 32 implications

(v)

(vi)

⇓
(vi) ⇐ (i) ⇔ (ii) ⇒ (iii) ⇒ (iv)

m

would still be correct. But local ﬁniteness is important for our proof of (iv) ⇒ (v). Indeed,
Hall-Rado Theorem, No. 35, does not carry over to arbitrary bipartite graphs, as the
following example shows.

48

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

Consider the bipartite graph B = B(Y, Z; E) of which the vertex set is the disjoint union
of two sets given with bijections with the integers, say α : Y −→ N and β : Z −→ N
(recall that N contains 0), and the edge set is

E = {(y, z) ∈ Y × Z | α(y) = β(z) + 1} ⊔ {(y, z) ∈ Y × Z | α(y) = 0}.

in other terms, α−1(n + 1) ∈ Y has a unique neighbour β−1(n) for all n ≥ 0, and the set
of neighbours of α−1(0) is the whole of Z. Then |∂EF| ≥ |F| for all every ﬁnite subset
F of either Y or Z, but there does not exist any (1, 1)-matching of B, i.e. B satisﬁes the
hypothesis of Hall-Rado Theorem, but not the conclusion.

We wish to stress that local ﬁniteness is important for our Theorem 32, and than an

even stronger condition, uniform local ﬁniteness, is important for Proposition 38.

On Remark 42 and metric spaces for which amenability does make sense. A
subspace Y of a metric space X is cobounded if supx∈X d(x, Y ) < ∞. A subspace Y of
X which is both uniformly discrete and cobounded is a net, as deﬁned in Remark 42,
also called a metric lattice [CoHa, Section 3.C]. An application of Zorn Lemma shows
that every metric space contains metric lattices. A metric space X is uniformly coarsely
proper if there exists R0 ≥ 0 such that, for every R ≥ 0, there exists an integer N such
that every ball of radius R in X can be covered by N balls of radius R0, equivalently if
X contains a uniformly locally ﬁnite metric lattice (for this equivalence, and others, see
[CoHa, Proposition 3.D.16]).

For uniformly coarsely metric spaces, amenability makes good sense, and is invariant by

coarse equivalence, in particular is invariant by quasi-isometry.

On Lemma 50 and an isoperimetric inequality. A better inequality than that of
the end of No. 50 appears in [Moha–88, Theorem 3.1(b)]. Particularized to our situation
(regular graph) and with our notation, it reads

ι∗(X) ≥

d2

d − 1 − (1 − ρ(X))

(1 − ρ(X))

(note that ρ(X) ≤ 1). We are grateful to T. Nagnibeda for this reference.
On No. 52 and the formula expressing ρ in terms of α. For an elaboration of this
formula, see [Bart–99]. There, Bartholdi establishes an equality between two generating
functions, one related to numbers of circuits of length n in some appropriate graph, and the
other related to numbers of circuits of length n with no backtracking in the same graph;
the formula of No. 52 is then obtained as the equality between the radii of convergence of
these two formal power series.

On No. 61 and inﬁnite amenable quotients of Burnside groups. The existence of
such quotients still appears as an open question in a more recent edition of the Kourovka
Notebook [Kour–15].

On Question 62.b and amenable quotients of Fm having large growth rate. Let
G be a ﬁnitely generated group and S a ﬁnite generating set. For every integer k ≥ 0,
denote by βG
S (k) the number of elements g ∈ G that can be written as products of at

AMENABILITY AND PARADOXICAL DECOMPOSITIONS

kpβG
S (k))k≥0.

most k elements in S ∪ S−1. The exponential growth rate of the pair (G, S) is the limit
ω(G, S) = limk→∞
S (k); the existence of the limit follows from the submultiplicativity
of the sequence (βG

The answer to the analogue for exponential growth rates of Question (b) in No. 62 is
negative; indeed the following is shown in [ArGG–05]. Consider an integer m ≥ 2 and the
free group Fm of rank m; there exists a sequence (Nn)n≥1 of normal subgroups of Fm such
that the quotient group Gn := Fm/Nn is amenable for all n ≥ 1 and limn→∞ ω(Gn, Sn) =
2m − 1, where Sn stands for the image of a free generating set of Fm by the canonical
projection of Fm onto Gn. Moreover, the sequence (Nn)n≥1 can be chosen such that Gn is
abelian-by-nilpotent for all n ≥ 1, or metabelian-by-ﬁnite for all n ≥ 1.

The minimal growth rate of a ﬁnitely generated group G is the number ω(G) = inf S ω(G, S),

where the inﬁmum is taken over all ﬁnite generating sets S of G. For a group which can
be generated by m elements, it is standard that 1 ≤ ω(G) ≤ 2m − 1, with equality on the
right if and only if G is free of rank m. For this and more on minimal growth rates, see
[GriH].

As much as we know, Question 62.b itself, on ω(G), is still open: For m ≥ 2, does
there exist a sequence (Nn)n≥1 of normal subgroups of Fm such that the quotient group
Gn = Fm/Nn is amenable for all n ≥ 1 and limn→∞ ω(Gn) = 2m − 1?
A misprint in No. 62. Watch out: with the normalization chosen in our paper (the
same as in the original paper [Kest–59]), ρ(Fm) = √2m − 1/m; the value √2m − 1 of the

published version of our paper is a misprint.

On No. 63, and equivalent deﬁnitions of supramenability for groups. The fol-
lowing is established (among other things) in [KeMR–13]. For a group G (which need not
be ﬁnitely generated), the following conditions are equivalent:

• G is supramenable,
• every cocompact action of G on a locally compact Hausdorﬀ space admits a non-
• there is no injective Lipschitz map from the free group of rank two to G.

zero invariant Radon measure,

A map f from a group G to a group H is Lipschitz if, for every ﬁnite subset S of G, there
exists a ﬁnite subset T of H such that f (x)f (y)−1 ∈ T for every x, y ∈ G with xy−1 ∈ S.
On No. 64, and types of growth for locally ﬁnite metric spaces. The notions of this
deﬁnition, i.e. subexponential growth, exponential growth, and superexponential growth,
should be restricted to uniformly locally ﬁnite metric spaces (rather than to discrete metric
spaces as in the 1999 publication).

Note that they are meaningfull for locally ﬁnite metric spaces, but in this context they
are not invariant by quasi-isometry. See the example given above in the comment on
Proposition 38, or [CoHa, Example 3.D.7].

On isoperimetric proﬁles, as in the remark that follows Lemma 65. For precise
estimates of various isoperimetric proﬁles – or, equivalently, of the corresponding Følner
functions – see [Ersc–03].

50

T. CECCHERINI-SILBERSTEIN, R.I. GRIGORCHUK, AND P. DE LA HARPE

On the terminology used for Proposition 67: coarsely connected metric spaces.
Rather than “long-range connected”, here is the terminology used in various places, in-
cluding [CoHa]: a metric space X is coarsely connected if there exists a constant C > 0
such that for every pair of points (x, x′) in X, there exists a ﬁnite sequence of points
(x0 = x, x1, . . . , xn = x′) in X such that d(xi−1, xi) ≤ C for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The point
is that coarse connectedness is invariant by coarse equivalence.

On Questions 70 and 73 on supramenable groups. At the best of our knowledge,
these two questions are still open:

question);

• does there exist a supramenable group of exponential growth? (Rosenblatt’s
• is it true that the direct product of two supramenable groups is always supra-

menable?

On Question 76, of Troﬁmov. This appears still as an open question in a more recent
edition of the Kourovka Notebook [Kour–15].
