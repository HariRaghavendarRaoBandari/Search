Abstract

A poromechanical model of partially saturated deformable porous media is proposed based on a phase
ﬁeld approach at modeling the behavior of the mixture of liquid water and wet air, which saturates the
pore space, the phase ﬁeld being the saturation (ratio). While the standard retention curve is expected
still to provide the intrinsic retention properties of the porous skeleton, depending on the porous texture,
an enhanced description of surface tension between the wetting (liquid water) and the non-wetting (wet
air) ﬂuid, occupying the pore space, is stated considering a regularization of the phase ﬁeld model based
on an additional contribution to the overall free energy depending on the saturation gradient. The aim
is to provide a more reﬁned description of surface tension interactions.

An enhanced constitutive relation for the capillary pressure is established together with a suitable
generalization of Darcy’s law, in which the gradient of the capillary pressure is replaced by the gradient
of the so-called generalized chemical potential, which also accounts for the “force” associated to the local
free energy of the phase ﬁeld model. A micro-scale heuristic interpretation of the novel constitutive law
of capillary pressure is proposed, in order to compare the envisaged model with that one endowed with
the concept of average interfacial area.

The considered poromechanical model is formulated within the framework of strain gradient theory
in order to account for possible eﬀects, at laboratory scale, of the micro-scale hydro-mechanical couplings
between highly-localized ﬂows (ﬁngering) and localized deformations of the skeleton (fracturing).

Introduction

The constitutive characterization of partially saturated porous media became of interest at the be-
ginning of the last century when scientiﬁc research started to face fundamental problems in geotechnics
and petroleum engineering, concerning modeling the response of partially imbibed soils, during imbi-
bition/drainage cycles (see [14, 82]), or modeling the behavior of sedimentary reservoir rocks, when a
multi-phase ﬂuid ﬂows through the porous network. Starting from the analysis of basic static problems,
it became clear that the balance between capillary and driving forces, in particular gravitational forces,
would have been the central subject of modeling eﬀorts. This pushed the research in the direction of
ﬁnding out simple relations between the curvature of the wetting/non-wetting ﬂuid interface and the
average content of the wetting ﬂuid, over a suitably deﬁned Representative Volume Element (RVE). The
main ideas of this identiﬁcation have been clearly sketched by [30, Chapter 6] for a partially saturated
truncated conical pore, specifying the inﬁnitesimal variation of the interfacial energy in terms of the
inﬁnitesimal variation of the volume occupied by the wetting ﬂuid (saturation). This naturally provided
the well-known deﬁnition of macro-scale capillary pressure, as the derivative of a macro-scale capillary
energy. In [69], [13], in the summarizing contribution by [6], in [97] etc., diﬀerent semi-empirical rela-
tions, between macro-scale capillary pressure and saturation have been stated, in order to specify the
retention properties of the porous skeleton. These retention curves typically exhibit hysteresis during
imbibition/drainage cycles, so as to ﬁt with experimental evidence.

At the same time the pioneering papers by Cahn and Hilliard [16, 17, 18] established the basic
framework within which modeling of multi-phase ﬂuid ﬂow is formulated in terms of space and time
evolution of the mass concentration or, in the general case, of a phase ﬁeld which can vary continuously
over thin interfacial layers. Beyond the original formulation due to [16] one can refer to [62] and [66] for
general reviews, as well as to [71], [11], [12] or [67]. Surface tension is recovered, in this context, considering

the integral, through the thickness of the layer, of the concentration gradient (or the gradient of the phase
ﬁeld). This approach progressively attracted more and more interest, in particular within the framework
of ﬂuid mechanics, because of its advantages for numerical calculations which do not necessitate adaptive
interface ﬁtting grids, see e.g.
[62, 66, 52]. Surprisingly however limited contributions attempted at
incorporating these ideas into modeling of unsaturated porous media, one can refer for instance to [79]
and [80] and more recently to [37, 38, 33] and [53].

This paper follows the research path traced by these authors to model partially saturated deformable
porous media, considering the pore network infused with a two-phase ﬂuid. Also the constitutive char-
acterization of the solid will be generalized with respect to the classical poromechanical model, in order
to describe the coupling between highly localized ﬂows and (possibly localized) strains.

For long time the above mentioned constitutive characterization of the macro-scale capillary pressure
in terms of the corresponding hysteretic retention curve has been the only relation used for describing the
hydraulic ﬂow through partially saturated porous media, being also the pivot of the hydro-mechanical
coupling with the constitutive law of the porous skeleton. Due to the coarse simpliﬁcation provided by
this model, however, it was ﬁnally recognized the existence of several problems in which the relation
between capillary pressure and saturation is not suﬃcient to describe at the same time surface tension,
between the wetting and the non-wetting ﬂuid, and the retention properties of the porous skeleton, due
to its texture. As a matter of fact what is understood by this constitutive law is, as already mentioned,
that no variation of the capillary pressure can be observed if no change of the saturation is induced by
external forces. This is due to the rough upscaling rule, from the micro to the macro-scale, which assumes
the variation of the area of interfaces proportional to the volume occupied by the ﬂuids, see [30]. On
the other hand, as originally pointed out by [75], redistribution of the ﬂuids within a porous medium
can occur also keeping constant the saturation, and instabilities can even arise from ﬂuid interfaces that
are unable to change curvature smoothly with variations in pressure (“Haines jumps”). In other words,
diﬀerent micro-scale conﬁgurations of interfaces between a wetting and a non-wetting phase are possible
for a given saturation.

In more reﬁned macro-scale formulations the speciﬁc cumulative measure of interfaces, between the
wetting and the non-wetting phase, say the speciﬁc interfacial area, is also introduced to account for the
micro-scale features of the ﬂuids within the RVE, see [59] and the related literature, e.g.
[81, 79, 76].
In order to clarify the meaning of this additional macro-scale state parameter, one can think of the
eﬀect of the saturation degree, on the macro-scale capillary pressure, as that which coarsely accounts for
the retention characteristics of the porous skeleton, depending on its texture, and consider on the other
hand the eﬀect of the cumulative measure of interfaces as a suitable corrective term, which allows for
describing diﬀerent admissible coexistence conﬁgurations of the saturating ﬂuids. Within this framework,
several experimental campaigns have been carried out, based on laboratory tests, see e.g. [40, 39, 28],
and also pore network micro-scale numerical simulations have been implemented, see e.g. [64], in order
to characterize the constitutive relation among capillary pressure, saturation and speciﬁc interfacial area.
Consider now the behavior of the porous skeleton, it is almost standard in continuum poromechanics
to introduce a constitutive prescription of stress in terms of strain and saturation, both in the case of
elastic and elasto-plastic deformations; one can refer among others to the seminal paper by [1] and the
related literature, see e.g. [78, 2], to the systematic formulation by [70], see also [85, 86], to the approach
based on the generalized Bishop eﬀective stress, see e.g.
[61, 50, 15, 65, 95] etc., or to some recent
contributions within the range of ﬁnite deformations of the porous skeleton, see [8] and [93]. Possible
modiﬁcations of these constitutive models, in order to account for the eﬀect of the speciﬁc interfacial area,
concern the improvement of the retention curve provided within the approach to multi-phase mechanics
proposed by [58, 59], in which velocities of phases and interfaces are employed to describe ﬂuid ﬂow and
skeleton deformation, see also [55, 56, 77]. Within this framework, however, several phenomena, related
to micro-structure remodeling, can not be captured, exactly as several phenomena related to the spatial
distribution of ﬂuids within the pores could not be described only in terms of saturation evolution. The
typical case is that of localized deformations which have been observed in laboratory scale experimental
tests, since the beginning of the 70s, initially using medical scanners for imaging sand bodies, see e.g.
[98] and [46], and later with the aid of RX computerized tomography and Digital Image Correlation, see
e.g.
[45, 68, 57] etc. Thanks to the improvements in the resolving power of tomographs as well as to
the progressively increasing skills of scientists in the treatment of experimental data, dry and (partially)
saturated specimens have been imaged under triaxial loading conditions to observe localized deformations
and porosity change, see e.g. [4, 5] and [44].

In order to model the eﬀects at the scale of the specimen of these micro-scale grain displacements,

2

and in particular to obtain the regularization of localized deformation patterns, the gradient theory of
elasto-plasticity, as well as the gradient approach to damage and fracture mechanics, have been adopted
in the literature. Typical references are [94], [20] and [73], as well as [49] and [9, 10]. In all these cases
however the hydro-mechanical coupling, if any, still remains restricted to the constitutive prescription of
the eﬀective or net stress, see e.g. [26] and [92].

As already mentioned, in this paper a novel general approach is developed, within the framework of
continuum poromechanics, which aims at merging phase ﬁeld modeling of multi-phase ﬂuid ﬂow with
unsaturated strain gradient poromechanics. While the standard retention curve is expected still to
provide the intrinsic retention properties of the porous skeleton, depending on the porous texture, an
enhanced description of surface tension between the wetting and the non-wetting ﬂuid, occupying the
pore space, is stated considering a regularized phase ﬁeld model (in the sense of [16]). Similarly to the
model which introduces the speciﬁc interfacial area as a corrective term of the standard retention curve,
this alternative formulation allows for detecting variations of capillary forces even when no change in
saturation is caused by the external loading. Indeed a similar approach has already been addressed in
the literature, attempting at modeling gravitational ﬁngering and saturation overshooting, through an
undeformable porous skeleton, or viscous ﬁngering through a Hele-Shaw cell, see [33, 35, 36]. However
no account has been taken of the possible coupling with the deformations of the porous skeleton.
In
the model which is going to be presented in this paper, on the other hand, the behavior of the solid
skeleton is described by means of a strain gradient model, to predict localized strains and fracture, when
considering irreversible processes. To the best of author’s knowledge, no general model accounting for
both the above mentioned items, say localization in ﬂuid ﬂow and strain, can be retrieved from the
literature, except a preliminary study by the author [87], stemming from previous results on modeling of
porous media saturated by quasi-incompressible ﬂuids, see [42, 88, 89] and [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Within
this enhanced framework, the hydro-mechanical coupling is therefore responsible not only for the eﬀects
of average variations of the hydraulic regime within the RVE on the skeleton deformation, and vice-versa,
see among others [78, 3, 95, 19, 83, 84], but it can also account for the eﬀects of capillary ﬁngering on
damaging and fracturing of the skeleton and vice-versa for the eﬀects of strain localization on permeability
variations and heterogeneous/anisotropic ﬂuid ﬂow.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 1 the basics of kinematics of (partially) saturated porous
media are summarized. In section 2 the expression of the virtual working of external forces, relative to a
second gradient multi-phase continuum, is manipulated to obtain the virtual working of internal forces,
which is consistent with the balance of the overall momentum.
In section 3 the ﬁrst and the second
principle of thermodynamics are introduced in order to get the generalized form of the Clausius-Duhem
inequality, prescribing the solid, ﬂuid and thermal dissipations. In section 4, the constitutive laws for
the eﬀective stress and hyper-stress are established, considering the contribution of strain and saturation
gradients to the overall free energy of the porous continuum; the generalized Darcy law is also deduced.
Section 5 is devoted to discuss the properties of the so-called pore-ﬂuid, constitutively characterized in
terms of a suitable double well potential, specifying the two phases of the ﬂuid within the pores.
In
section 6 the generalized prescription of the macro-scale capillary pressure is placed, accounting for its
dependence on the saturation gradient. In section 7 the governing equations, say the overall balance law
and the generalized Darcy law, are deduced by means of a variational approach which also provides the
proper boundary conditions. Finally in section 8 some conclusions are stated.

1. Kinematics

A macroscopic description of kinematics is adopted, treating the partially saturated porous medium as
the superposition of a skeleton and a binary mixture of liquid water and wet air. The current placement
of the skeleton particles is provided by the deformation of a reference conﬁguration D0. The partial
saturation of the pore space is accounted for thinking of the ﬂuid mixture as a non-uniform ﬂuid in the
sense of [16], i.e. a ﬂuid possibly having a spatial variation in one of its intensive scalar properties.
Let χα : D0 ×I → IE be the α-th component of the deformation (placement) of the skeleton particles
with respect to a ﬁxed orthonormal frame in the Euclidean space IE of positions; D0 is the reference
conﬁguration of the solid constituent and I a time interval. The image of D0 under the deformation
map is the current conﬁguration of the porous medium, say D ⊂ IE. Moreover let uα indicate the
displacement of the solid particles, Fαi = χα,i the deformation gradient, along the i-th direction of an
orthonormal frame in the reference conﬁguration of the solid, and Eij := (FαiFαj − δij) /2 the associated
strain tensor, δij being the Kronecker delta. From now on Greek indices label the components of any n-th

3

order tensor with respect to a frame in the Euclidean space, whilst Latin indices label the components of
any n-th order tensor with respect to a frame into the reference conﬁguration of the skeleton D0. Finally
let vα
s be the α-th component of the velocity of the skeleton particles. As usual within the framework
of poromechanics, the notions of Eulerian porosity n and Lagrangian porosity φ are introduced, as the
current pore volume density per unit volume of the porous continuum, and the current pore volume
density per unit reference volume, respectively. Clearly φ = J n; J being the determinant of F .

Concerning the non-uniform ﬂuid the intensive scalar property, used from now on to characterize the
biphasic characteristic of the ﬂuid, is not the mass concentration but the volume density of the liquid
phase with respect to the volume of the pores, say the degree of saturation. The liquid phase of the
mixture (water) is assumed incompressible and the gaseous phase (wet air) is assumed to be passive
(that is, have inﬁnite mobility) so that its density can be neglected with respect to that of the liquid,
ρL; the apparent density of the ﬂuid mixture, say the mass density of the non-uniform ﬂuid per unit
volume of the porous medium, is therefore deﬁnitely prescribed in terms of the volumetric liquid content
θ. If Sr indicates the saturation degree (saturation ratio), measuring the current volume occupied by
the liquid per unit volume of the pores, the liquid content is θ = n Sr and the ﬂuid apparent density
is (n ρf ) = ρL(n Sr) = ρL θ. The saturation degree ranges within the interval [0, 1], where Sr = 0 and
Sr = 1 indicate the gaseous and the liquid phase, respectively. The kinematics of the non-uniform ﬂuid
is speciﬁed as in [89]; the reference placement of the non-uniform ﬂuid particles is therefore prescribed
by means of a regular map g : D0 × I → Df
0 deﬁned on the reference conﬁguration of the skeleton. It
identiﬁes the ﬂuid material particle within a reference domain Df
0 , which occupies, at time t, the same
current place as the solid particle, chosen in D0. Accordingly the ﬂuid velocity coincides with the time
derivative of χf (·, t) := χ(·, t) ◦ g(·, t)−1, which means for every reference particle X ∈ D0 and every
current place x = χ(X, t):

α(X, t) − Fαi(X, t)(cid:0)G(X, t)−1(cid:1)

where Gki := gk,i; the Einstein summation for repeated indices is understood in equation (1). Similarly
to the deformation gradient of the solid skeleton also the gradient of χf (·, t) can be deﬁned in terms of
the gradient of χ and g as F f = F G−1.

Both the saturation degree and the liquid content are naturally deﬁned on the current conﬁguration
of the porous medium, however the corresponding pull-back in the reference conﬁguration of the skeleton
can easily be deﬁned by means of the inverse of the deformation map χ(·, t). The mass conservation of
the ﬂuid mixture can be stated, following [29], in the form

remarks, the incompressibility of the liquid, say ρL = const, implies equation (2) to reduce to:

In equations (2)-(3), for the sake of simplicity, no explicit dependence of the considered ﬁelds on the
current position or the corresponding placement in the skeleton conﬁguration has been speciﬁed. It is
worth to underline that even if the liquid is incompressible the non-uniform ﬂuid is not, consequently no
restriction on the ﬂuid velocity is placed.

2. External & strain working: from a mixture model towards a Biot-like model

Here an approach much similar to that developed by [88] is adopted, in order to deduce the strain
working relative to a porous medium within the framework of gradient continuum mechanics. Starting
from the standard formulation of the mechanics of superimposed continua, and using the almost classical
formulation of gradient theories introduced by [96], [74] and [51], the external working of the solid-ﬂuid
mixture is deﬁned as a continuous linear functional of the velocity ﬁelds vs and vf :

αβ and Πc
αβγ are tensorial quantities deﬁned over the current conﬁguration, which represent the stress
and the so-called hyper-stress, acting on the solid and the ﬂuid. Let ˆxB, B = 1, 2 indicate the local
parametrization of the boundary ∂D, the tensor ﬁeld QBβ := ∂ ˆxB/∂xβ is the projection tensor onto the
tangent space of ∂D, while the partial derivatives with respect to ˆxB-coordinates indicate the surface-
gradient; µB are the components in the surface coordinate system of the Darboux tangent-normal vector
to each edge of ∂D. Finally [[·]] = (·)+ − (·)− indicates the jump through the edge. Equations (5) imply
that surface tractions depends on the curvature of ∂D, say the surface gradient of the normal unit vector
m, and, in the limit when this curvature tends to inﬁnity, say over the edges E of ∂D, that a line density
of forces must arise. Thinking of the pure solid, double forces generalize the concept of skew-symmetric
couples, which is typical of Cosserat or couple-stress theories, bearing into account not only surface
density of moment but also surface density of symmetric couples. The former, working on a combination
of diﬀerential shearing, bending and torsion, the latter, on diﬀerential elongation. On the other hand,
thinking of non-viscous but non-uniform ﬂuids, characterized by internal capillarity, say Cahn-Hilliard
ﬂuids, double forces are associated only to symmetric couples working on diﬀerential liquid content or,
within our framework, saturation ratio, which allows to describe surface tension eﬀects, see e.g. [90, 91].
In this case, which is the one considered in this paper, the hyper-stress tensor relative to the ﬂuid reduces
to Πf

αβγ = δαβ πf
γ .
In order to deduce a Biot-like poromechanical model the overall balance of momentum must hold true
and the corresponding strain working must be characterized in terms of strains and stresses deﬁned over
the reference conﬁguration of the skeleton. Using equations (5)2 and (5)3 together with the orthogonal
decomposition of the velocity gradients, given by vc

3. Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics of porous media has been summarized by [29, 30] for two or more monophasic
superimposed interacting continua, say the solid skeleton and the ﬂuids saturating the porous space. In
that case, the speciﬁc internal energies of the ﬂuids, which ﬁll the pores, are separately deﬁned, whether
they are in the liquid or in the gaseous phase; whilst the energy due to interfacial interactions between the
ﬂuids and among the solid and the ﬂuids are incorporated into the macroscopic energy of the skeleton.
This contribution to the energy accounts for the micro-scale adhesion properties among the constituents,
coherently with the Young-Dupr´e equation, which at the micro-scale states the equilibrium of the triple
line keeping in contact the solid wall (of the pore), with the wetting and the non-wetting phase, see
e.g.
[41]. Considering a geometrically simple conﬁguration of the porous space and a rough upscaling
rule, as that already mentioned in the Introduction, which assumes the variation of the area of interfaces
proportional to the volume occupied by the phases, a macroscopic interfacial energy, per unit volume,
can be explicitly separated from the energy of the skeleton and regarded as a function of the saturation
ratio Sr only, see [31]. Afterwards the micro-scale surface tension can be related to the derivative of

(a) Van der Waals’ like potential

(b) Chemical potential

Figure 1: The liquid and the gaseous phase coexist at equilibrium as they are isopotential minima of the
ﬂuid free energy

this energy, with respect to Sr, which is interpreted a-posteriori as the so-called macro-scale capillary
pressure, see e.g. [6, 97] and [29]. The macro-scale capillary pressure, deﬁned in this way, accounts at
the same time for two distinct features, say the eﬀect of surface tension between the liquid and the gas,
stored within any possible reservoir, and the eﬀect of the retention characteristics of the porous material.
Several criticisms have been moved to this deﬁnition of the macroscopic capillary pressure; in particular
Gray and Hassanizadeh [54, 58, 59] demonstrated that the spatial distribution of interfaces within a multi-
phase system is fundamental in order to characterize the intrinsic state of the system.

Here a novel approach is adopted in order to incorporate, into the macroscopic constitutive prescrip-
tion, the role of the interface between the two ﬂuids stored in the pores, describing the ﬂuid mixture
as a non-uniform diphasic ﬂuid in the spirit of [16]. A phase-ﬁeld model with possible diﬀuse interface
is considered, which is analogous to that one of (more than) two immiscible components incompressible
ﬂows, see [71], [11], or [66] for a general review. As already noticed in § 1 and following [35, 36] the phase
ﬁeld here is the degree of saturation Sr.

The internal energy of the ﬂuid is given by
Ef = nρf ef (1/ρf , sf ) + κf

where the term ρf ef is a double-well potential depending on the speciﬁc density ρf and parametrized by
the speciﬁc entropy sf . The non-local energy κf
a regularization of the non-convex energy contribution. As usual the state equation of the ﬂuid deﬁnes
a relation between conjugate variables; in particular the so-called ﬂuid thermodynamic pressure P, and
the ﬂuid chemical potential µ can be deﬁned in terms of the the density ρf :

fρf := δαβ (nρf ),α (nρf ),β ,

(cid:1) ,
(cid:0)fρf
(cid:1) penalizes the formation of interfaces and provides
(cid:0)fρf

(13)

, µ :=

∂ (ρf ef )

∂ρf

P := − ∂ef

∂(1/ρf )

.

(14)

T in equation (14) is the absolute temperature, which is conjugate to the speciﬁc entropy by T = ∂ef /∂sf .
The double-well volumetric energy resembles that of Van der Waals’ model and allows for describing
coexistence of the immiscible phases, even if no mass exchange is considered. No information on the
domains occupied by the phases in the current conﬁguration is supplied by the model if this contribution
to the ﬂuid energy is the only non-vanishing one. According to Maxwell’s rule, an aﬃne term, with
respect to ρf , can be added to the Van der Waals-like energy to make arise two isopotential phases,
characterized by the same (vanishing) value of the chemical potential µ, see Figure 1a and [30]. The
non-local contribution allows for governing the coarsening of the domains occupied by the ﬂuid phases
and pattern formation.
Indeed it provides just a correction of the bulk energy, when considering the
so-called ﬂat interface limit, see [16], whilst it constitutes the main part of the energy of the non-uniform
ﬂuid, when describing phenomena in which a clear scale separation can not be assumed, as in topological
transitions in multi-phase ﬂuids [71] or gravity driven ﬁngering through porous media [33].

Because of the constitutive law (13), the following prescriptions on the ﬂuid stress and hyper-stress

I being the identity tensor and trI = n the dimension of the Euclidean space IE. The thermodynamic
pressure P and the chemical potential µ given in (14) are just a part of these constitutive prescriptions.
Σ(cid:48)f represents the deviatoric stress acting on the ﬂuid, which is non-vanishing because of the gradient
contribution to energy.

As already noticed incompressibility of the liquid phase means that the variations of the density ρf
are univocally determined by the variations of the degree of saturation, so that equation (15) can be
rephrased in terms of the saturation ratio Sr, see e.g. [35]. In particular the double well shape of the
energy potential can be prescribed assuming the ﬂuid energy per unit volume of the porous medium to
be a kind of Duﬃng potential

whilst the non-local term is typically assumed quadratic in the gradient of nSr:

(17)

Here γnw is the surface tension between the non-wetting and the wetting phase, whilst R is the charac-
teristic size of the channel through which the ﬂuid can pass, see e.g. [11]. In Figure 1 the energy per unit
volume and the corresponding chemical potential are plotted. The energy of the non-uniform ﬂuid could
also be prescribed in terms of a diﬀerent phase ﬁeld as for instance the mass concentration of the liquid
without its double well feature being modiﬁed. With an abuse of notation from now on µ will indicate
the derivative of Ψf with respect to Sr rather than to ρf , as indicated in equation (14).
As saturation can not overwhelm the limit Sr = 1, a suitable constraint should be stated when
formulating the minimization of the ﬂuid energy potential Ψf with respect to Sr, say Sr ≤ 1 which
corresponds to Sr − 1 = −α2, with α ≥ 0 a slack variable used to transform the inequality constraint
into equality. This yields the introduction of a Lagrangian multiplier, in the functional to be made
stationary, representing the reactive chemical potential, µr, which allows to account for the transition
from partially-saturated to fully-saturated conditions. In partially-saturated states Sr < 1 implies α (cid:54)= 0
and consequently µr = 0; on the other hand when saturation is attained α vanishes and the reactive
chemical potential plays the role of the liquid pressure in standard saturated poromechanics. Looking at
equation (17) it is worth to notice that in the case of saturation the non-local contribution to energy still
does not vanish, but reduces to a function of the porosity gradient.
The eﬀect of conﬁnement of the air-water mixture into the porous space, say the retention character-
istics of the porous material, will be accounted for by an additional energy Esf . Within the considered
framework, no a-priori constitutive characterization is assumed on this functional, but suitable restric-
tions on it are deduced from the ﬁrst and the second principle of thermodynamics, summarized in the
generalized form of the Clausius-Duhem (dissipation) inequality.

In the following paragraphs the explicit form of the dissipation relative to the partially saturated
porous medium is stated, taking in due account the expression of the strain working given by equation
(12). The corresponding restrictions on the constitutive law of the porous skeleton and the local diﬀusion
ﬂuid mass ﬂux Mk are deduced.

3.1. The ﬁrst principle of thermodynamics

Modifying the form of the energy equation, stated by [29, equation (3.14)] for a standard porous
continuum, so as to separate the interaction energy between the solid and the non-uniform ﬂuid implies
the ﬁrst principle of thermodynamics to read as

where dc/dt indicates the time derivative following the motion of the particle c = {s, f}. In a similar
way to the ﬂuid, the energy of the solid is deﬁned in terms of the corresponding intrinsic energy as

motion of the solid grains, partly to the motion of the molecules of the ﬂuid, say the liquid and the gas.
˚Q accounts for the rate of heat externally supplied and can be prescribed in terms of a surface rate of

3.2. The second principle of thermodynamics & the Causius-Duhem inequality

the porous continuum is stated in the form:

where sc stands for the speciﬁc entropy of the c-th constituent and qα again indicates the surface rate

skeleton reads therefore:

(cid:90)

3.3. Dissipation

A characterization of the dissipation relative to the solid and the non-uniform ﬂuid is obtained, starting
from the Clausius-Duhem inequality (25), separating, within the overall free energy Ψ and the overall
entropy S, the contributions of the bulk ﬂuid, say mf ψf and mf sf , from the residual terms relative to
the energy and the entropy of the bulk skeleton and the interfaces, say Ψs and Ss:

Ψs = Ψ − mf ψf (ρf , T ) ,

Ss = S − mf sf .

(26)

9

Remind that ψf = ef − T sf is the Legendre transformation of ef , such that ∂ψf /∂T = −sf . This
approach stems from [7], who deﬁned the wetted solid as a system composed of the solid skeleton and
a thin layer of ﬂuid attached to the internal walls of the pore. The aim is proving that Ψs is a state
function which prescribes the constitutive behavior of the skeleton in thermo-poroelasticity, say in the
case when just reversible processes are involved by the deformation of the porous continuum. In this
case the residual part of the dissipation will depend just on the Lagrangian ﬁltration vector Mk and the
gradient of the absolute temperature.

The ﬂuid mass conservation (2) together with the constitutive law relative to the ﬂuid stress and

hyper-stress (15), allow to rephrase the Clausius-Duhem inequality (25) in the following form:

The coeﬃcients of dφ/dt, dSr/dt, d (φSr),k /dt and Mk reported in equation (27) are explicitly deduced
from equation (25) in Appendix A. Following [29] the dissipation (27) can be split into three terms, one
related to the solid skeleton, one to the non-uniform ﬂuid and the last one referred to thermal eﬀects.
These three contributions are separately assumed non-negative:

As previously remarked, equation (28) states that within thermo-poroelasticity the Helmholtz free energy
of the skeleton is a state function:

Ψs = (cid:98)Ψs(Eij, Eij,k, φ, Sr, (φSr),k, T ),

(31)

which depends not only on the strain of the skeleton, the Lagrangian porosity and the degree of saturation,
as in standard unsaturated poromechanics, but also on the gradient of strain, Eij,k, and the gradient
of Lagrangian water content, (φSr),k. It is worth to notice that equation (31) could be also formulated
considering a free energy function depending on the gradient of strain, Eij,k, and the gradient of water
content, (nSr),k, in addition to the dependence on (Eij, φ, Sr), so modifying the deﬁnition of conjugate
variables.

As the ﬂuid dissipation (29) does not vanish except at equilibrium, the ﬁltration force must be related
to the ﬁltration vector itself, in a way to fulﬁll the dissipation inequality during evolution. Finally
equation (30) recalls the well-known result that heat ﬂows through materials along the direction of the
negative gradient of temperature (from higher to lower).

Now, assuming isothermal conditions, the poro-elastic constitutive equations of the solid skeleton
and the generalized Darcy law relative to the ﬂuid are deduced and compared with those ones typically
adopted in modeling the behavior of partially saturated porous media.

4. Poroelastic constitutive relations

According with equation (28) and its corollary remarks, the poroelastic constitutive relations of the

solid skeleton must fulﬁll the following restriction:

φPc = −∂Ψs/∂Sr, if one assumes

As a consequence equations (34) and (35)1 can be rephrased as the generalized constitutive characteriza-
tions of the macro-scale capillary pressure Pc and the ﬂuid thermodynamic pressure P, which account for
the spatial distribution of interfaces, within the porous network, considering the additional contribution
of the ﬂuid hyper-stress:

(37)

Equation (33) is standard, within the framework of gradient theories of continuum mechanics; on the
other hand equations (37) deserve a deeper discussion in order to understand in which sense they can be
considered an enhanced constitutive prescription of the macro-scale capillary pressure and the thermody-
namic pressure of the ﬂuid. Developing a micro-scale analysis this model will be compared, in § 6, with
the micro-structured one which accounts for the dependence of the capillary pressure on the so-called
interfacial area between the non-wetting and the wetting phase, see e.g. [58, 59, 64, 81].

4.1. Generalized eﬀective stresses

Some additional remarks can be deduced from the thermodynamical restrictions stated by equation
(28) if the solid grains, which constitute the matrix of the porous medium, undergo negligible volume
change. In this case the Lagrangian porosity is deﬁnitely prescribed in terms of volume changes of the
porous elementary volume, say: J = 1 + φ − φ0, φ0 being the reference value of porosity, see e.g. [29,
Chapter 3]. The solid dissipation can therefore be rewritten and the generalization of Bishop’s eﬀective
stress naturally arises, within the framework of the considered gradient model. Assuming small strains,
but allowing the porous skeleton to suﬀer strain gradients of order O(1), with respect to the considered
small perturbation parameter, the simpliﬁed expression of Φs reads as follows:
− ˙Ψs.

P (cid:48)

(39)

As a consequence the corresponding free energy of the solid skeleton can be regarded as a state function
of strain, strain gradient, saturation degree and gradient of liquid content, only. The general form of
equations (39), when no restriction to small strains is assumed, is reported in Appendix B.

11

If one aims at investigating non-reversible processes aﬀecting the behavior of the solid skeleton, dif-
ferent dissipative mechanisms should be analyzed, which could concern interactions among the grains of
the solid skeleton, or between the grains and the ﬂuid. In the ﬁrst case inelastic constitutive relations for
the solid stress and (eventually) hyper-stress should be introduced, in the second one hysteresis during
wetting-drying cycles should modify the prescriptions of the retention properties, see e.g. [60]. It is not
the goal of this paper to address modeling inelastic processes, however this can be done specifying the
way in which dissipation depends on a suitable set of internal variables.

4.2. Generalized Darcy law

As usual in poromechanics the dissipation inequality (29) relative to the ﬂuid can be satisﬁed requiring
L. This implies the coeﬃcient of

Φf to be a quadratic function of Mk, which means: Φf = (AklMlMk) /ρ2
Mk in equation (29) to be constitutively constrained to

where SrρLef is the speciﬁc free energy of the ﬂuid per unit volume of the pores and therefore coincides
with the double-well energy potential Ψf , possibly describing coexistence of the liquid and the gaseous
phases, see equation (16). For the sake of simplicity, the capillary energy U has been introduced, following
[31], so that ∂Ψs/∂Sr = φ ∂U/∂Sr.

According with classical arguments proposed within the framework of diﬀuse interface models in ﬂuid
mechanics, see e.g. [62, 63, 12], the ﬁrst two terms in equation (41) correspond to the so-called generalized
chemical potential of the non-uniform ﬂuid deﬁned as

(42)

the whole quantity µ + ∂U/∂Sr can therefore be interpreted as the generalized chemical potential of the
pore-ﬂuid, say of the non-uniform ﬂuid within the pore network. This last accounts, on one hand, for
surface tension eﬀects which are typical of a diphasic ﬂuid on the other one for the retention properties
of the skeleton, due to its texture, by means of ∂U/∂Sr.

Apparently the role of the capillary energy U is that of modifying the double-well potential Ψf which
prescribes the free energy of the ﬂuid, in order to account for the presence of a conﬁning surface densely
distributed within the porous continuum. The new free energy (Ψf + U ), which can be called eﬀective
energy of the pore-ﬂuid, has not the same minima as Ψf , as they are shifted inward the interval (0, 1)
[79, 80]. In § 5 the
from below or from above whether the solid skeleton is gas or liquid wet, see e.g.
eﬀects of combining these two energy contributions are discussed, considering the retention properties of
diﬀerent soils. A similar behavior has been discussed by [36], modeling two-phase ﬂow in a Hele-Shaw
cell, introducing a suitable symmetry-breaking function.

5. Constitutive characterization of the pore-ﬂuid

Providing a constitutive characterization of the pore-ﬂuid, say of the ﬂuid within the pore network, is
generally achieved, in unsaturated poromechanics, assuming a proper prescription of the retention curve,
which means prescribing the capillary pressure Pc, or the capillary energy U , as a function of Sr. As
already noticed in § 3 however, the air-water mixture, which saturates the pore space, is regarded here as
a non-uniform ﬂuid, the corresponding saturation ratio being used to characterize the state of the ﬂuid at
any current placement. No distinction is therefore made explicit between the pressure of the liquid and
the pressure of the gaseous phase, as well as between the corresponding chemical potentials. Moreover
no algebraic relation between the saturation degree and the capillary pressure or the chemical potential

of the ﬂuid can a-priori be stated, without solving, at least at equilibrium, the following generalized
Richards equation:

Here the permeability of the porous medium has been assumed isotropic: (A−1)mk = Ksat k(Sr)δmk, Ksat
being the so-called saturated permeability and k(Sr) the relative permeability of the wetting phase, see
e.g.
[29, 30]. As usual in unsaturated poromechanics equation (43) which provides the distribution in
space and time of the saturation degree is deduced merging the mass conservation law (2) and the Darcy
law, which in this case takes the form given by equation (41).

At stationary conditions, say when ∂(φSr)/∂t = 0, equation (43) reduces to a fourth order partial
diﬀerential equation in the space variable, which is deﬁnitely similar to the one prescribing the mass
density distribution of a Cahn-Hilliard ﬂuid at equilibrium. However a fundamental additional term is
here accounted for, say the derivative of U with respect to Sr, which allows for describing the conﬁning
eﬀect on the non-uniform ﬂuid, due to the presence of the porous skeleton. Equation (43) looks also
similar to that one stated in [37, equation (2)] and [33, equation (13)], who adopted a phase ﬁeld model
for describing gravity ﬁngers and saturation overshoot, during water inﬁltration through a non-deformable
soil. In this case the diﬀerence resides in the account for the chemical potential µ = ∂Ψf /∂Sr in (43),
allowing for possible coexistence between the phases of the non-uniform ﬂuid. Moreover equation (43) is
here deﬁnitely coupled with the balance equation of the overall continuum.

Following the same procedure which induced the deﬁnition of the generalized chemical potential (42)
when simulating multi-phase ﬂows, see e.g. [12], equation (43) can be rephrased in terms of the functional
derivative of the free energy of the pore-ﬂuid

where the generalized eﬀective chemical potential of the pore-ﬂuid µeﬀ has been introduced. The energy
of the skeleton depends on the gradient of the liquid content, so that the gradient contribution to the
constitutive law of the non-uniform ﬂuid is not modiﬁed, with respect to equation (15). For the sake of
completeness the eﬀective chemical potential of the pore-ﬂuid, accounting only for the derivative of the
eﬀective energy Ψf + U is deﬁned as µeﬀ := ∂(Ψf + U )/∂Sr = µ + ∂U/∂Sr. As already noticed µeﬀ is
diﬀerent from µ, because of the term involving the derivative of the capillary energy U , but it also diﬀers
from the ﬂow potential Φ introduced by [33, equation (12)], because of the term involving the derivative
of the ﬂuid energy Ψf .
The role of Ψf and U in the characterization of the spatial distribution of Sr, µ, Pc and µeﬀ deserves
a deeper analysis in order to underline the main diﬀerences between the proposed modiﬁed Richards
equation (45) and that one stated by [33] for describing gravity ﬁngering in soils.

chemical potential exhibits, for all the considered textures, a non-monotonic behavior and in panels (a),
(b), (c), (g) and (i) two additional zeros (the spots) with respect to that at Sr = 1, which can always
be found. This feature corresponds to the fact that the eﬀective pore-ﬂuid energy Ψf + U maintains the
double-well shape typical of Ψf , see panels (a), (b), (c), (g), (i) of Figure 3. The two minima of Ψf +U are
however no more isopotential and the one associated to the smallest value of Sr has been shifted inwards
the interval (0, 1). As already noticed the correction provided by U to Ψf allows therefore to account for
the wetting properties of the grains, which do not permit the whole ﬂuid to escape from the pore space
even when a vanishing chemical potential is assumed. In all the other cases the non-monotonic behavior
of µeﬀ does not correspond to additional stationary states of the pore-ﬂuid as the energy Ψf + U exhibits
only one minimum.

This non-monotonic behavior of the eﬀective chemical potential resembles that one postulated by [47]
in order to explain the formation of gravity ﬁngers in soils. However it is worth to underline, following
[34], that the appropriate form of the potential −∂U/∂Sr is captured solving an inverse problem which
stems from experimental evidence. As a consequence, the eﬀective generalized chemical potential µeﬀ

can indeed be hydrostatic at equilibrium, and therefore consistent with gravitational loading, even if the
eﬀective chemical potential µeﬀ is not.

6. Micro-scale interpretation of the enhanced constitutive prescription of capillary pressure

In order to compare the enhanced model of capillary pressure (37) with the classical one, see e.g.
[29, 30], the dependence of the free energy Ψs on the saturation degree Sr is concentrated, as already done
in § 4.2 and § 5, in the capillary energy U multiplied by the Lagrangian porosity, say φU (Sr). Equation
(37)1 therefore explicitly improves the basic constitutive prescription of the macro-scale capillary pressure
by a correction depending on the gradient of the Jacobian determinant J and the gradient of the water
content nSr, once the quadratic form (17) for the non-local contribution to the energy of the ﬂuid has
been assumed:

(48)

When the hyper-stress acting on the non-uniform ﬂuid vanishes, this correction vanishes as well; in other
words the larger the gradient of the liquid content is, the wider the discrepancy between the standard
and the enhanced constitutive prescriptions of Pc will be. The enhanced constitutive prescription (48) is
expected therefore to yield signiﬁcant modiﬁcations of the capillary pressure, in the narrow subdomains of
the current shape of the porous medium where signiﬁcant gradients of the liquid content can be detected.
This justiﬁes the claim of an interpretation of this contribution in terms of the so-called speciﬁc interfacial
area.

According to the experimental data, reported among others by [40, 39] and [28], and the pore-network
[64], local

numerical simulation of quasi-static drainage and imbibition of a porous medium, see e.g.

saturation degree but also by changes in the interfacial area anw, which accounts for the local cumulative
measure of the interfaces between the non-wetting and the wetting phase, per unit volume of the RVE.
Apparently changes in the interfacial area may or may not result into an incoming or an outcoming ﬂow
through the RVE, however, in the spirit of providing an interpretation of the considered macro-scale
model of the capillary force, in terms of possible eﬀects of the interfacial area, only the variations of anw,
which are associated to a ﬂow through the boundary of the RVE are considered, whilst no account is
taken of those variations which yield a pure remodeling of the internal structure of the RVE. In other
words a relation between the interfacial area and the gradient of the saturation degree is expected to be
identiﬁed, only if the liquid particles are displaced towards the boundary of the RVE.
To verify the validity of this hypothesis a heuristic micro-scale analysis is developed deforming a
prototype initial conﬁguration B0 of a RVE by a quasi-static loading path driven by the Lagrangian
gradient of the macro-scale Jacobian determinant J; the liquid is squeezed out of the porous chamber
along the same direction of the gradient of J. The saturation degree Sr is assumed to be not aﬀected
by the considered micro-scale deformation, which means that the ratio between the volume of liquid and
the volume of the pores within the RVE does not vary during the considered deformation process. This
assumption allows to capture the correction to the constitutive prescription of Pc provided by the gradient
term of the ﬂuid energy only. In Figure 4 possible initial conﬁgurations of the RVE, parametrized by the
degree of saturation are depicted; the dashed lines delimitate the boundary of the reference shapes.

Figure 4: Referential RVEs parametrized by the saturation degree; the dashed line indicates the boundary

of the RVE, is L = 0.25, whilst their radius is R = (1 − L)/2. (X1, X2) indicates coordinate system in
the reference conﬁguration.

Each RVE corresponds to the deformed current conﬁguration B of an initial domain B0 constituted
by four identical beads among which a suitable amount of liquid water (the wetting phase) is trapped by
capillary forces. The amount of liquid (in volume) is prescribed by the value of the degree of saturation; on
the other hand its spatial distribution is a function of the local wetting properties of the beads. Here, for
the sake of simplicity, the equilibrium value of Young’s contact angle is kept constant during deformation
and circular interfaces between the non-wetting and the wetting ﬂuid are assumed at each loading step.
Tuning the parameterizing value of Sr is expected to provide a-posteriori the relation between the speciﬁc
interfacial area and the saturation degree, and consequently to compare the results of the model with
liq)−1 ◦ χm
the benchmark experimental data, relative to drainage-imbibition cycles. Let χm and gm = (χm
be the micro-scale placement of the solid and the pull-back, in the solid reference conﬁguration, of the
inverse of the micro-scale placement of the liquid χm
liq, respectively; they are diﬀeomorphisms over the
above mentioned reference conﬁguration, similarly to the corresponding macro-scale maps introduced
in § 1. In particular χm, which is naturally deﬁned over the reference conﬁguration of the solid D0
s, is
extended over the pore space network. On the other hand the domain of gm is the subset D0
liq, of the
reference conﬁguration, mapped by χm into the inter-granular space occupied by the liquid in the current
conﬁguration. Notice that D0
liq does not coincide with the initial conﬁguration of the liquid, but it is the
pull-back of the current shape of the liquid into the reference (initial) conﬁguration of the solid grains,
see Figure 5.

Let x, which indicates the macro-scale placement in the current conﬁguration of the porous medium,
be the centroid of the considered RVE and let z be the micro-scale current position of a solid or a liquid
particle within the RVE; the corresponding placements in the reference conﬁguration of the solid are X

and Z, respectively. In Figures 6-8 diﬀerent RVEs are depicted, which are obtained by deforming the
prototype initial conﬁgurations, reported in Figure 4, by the above mentioned loading path driven by the
gradient of J. In particular the deformation is achieved by the relative motion of the beads. For the sake
of simplicity a quadratic displacement ﬁeld, deﬁned over the referential domain enclosed by the centers
of the beads, is assumed for describing this deformation mechanism, even if the beads suﬀer just mutual
translations. Considering a local coordinate system, with the origin in the centroid of the reference shape
of the RVE, the micro-scale displacement is therefore assigned as

A representation formula for the displacement of the liquid, with respect to its initial conﬁguration, is not
stated, but suitable assumptions on its admissible current conﬁguration are required. As already noticed
the liquid is squeezed out of the pore due to the mutual displacement of the beads. In Appendix C the
parametrization of the domain occupied by the liquid at each loading step is illustrated in details. The
micro-scale parametrization (49) of the displacement of the grains and the hypotheses on the displacement
of the liquid provide a micro-scale interpretation of the macro-scale gradients of the Jacobian determinant
J and the volume liquid content φSr, by recalling the notion of averaging operators relative to the solid
and the liquid constituent, see for more details [72], and [48]. As a matter of fact the macroscopic gradients
of J and φSr, introduced in equation (48), can be explicitly calculated, starting from the micro-scale data,
as the integrals over the counter image under χm of those parts of the boundary of the RVE occupied by
solid or liquid particles, if any:

of J to be along the abscissa X1. The spherical part of the deformation gradient on the other hand
is determined so as to keep constant the degree of saturation and to allow the liquid phase to form a
meniscus concave towards the gaseous phase outside the RVE and tangent to its boundary. The liquid is
displaced along the same direction of the gradient of the Jacobian determinant, see Figures 6b-6d, 7b-7d
and 8b-8d.

As already noticed the contact angle between the solid and the liquid is kept constant, during the
deformation process, and the interfaces between the wetting and the non-wetting phase maintain a circum-
ferential shape. The smaller the saturation Sr is the less realistic this assumption will be, see Figure 4a.
Being required to simplify the calculations, it therefore remains valid only for values of Sr which do not
allow thin capillary bridges to form.

(see Figure 4b).

Equations (50) and (51) motivate the conjecture assumed at the beginning of this section on the
eﬀects of the average interfacial area anw on the macroscopic capillary pressure. As a matter of fact they
imply that the corrective terms in equation (48) are not zero only if the integrals over speciﬁc parts of
the boundary of the reference conﬁguration of the RVE do not vanish. In other words the ﬂuid trapped
among the beads must attain the boundary in order for the gradient of the liquid content to not fade
away. Thus in order to prove a functional correlation between gradient of φSr and interfacial area, all
the micro-scale deformations which do not drive the liquid to the boundary of the RVE should not be
taken into account.

Considering the geometrical data reported in the caption of Figure 4 and the above mentioned as-
sumptions on the maps χm and gm, the corrective terms of capillary pressure introduced in equation (48)

can be explicitly calculated by means of equations (50)-(51). At the same time the average interfacial
area consistent with the envisaged liquid distribution, can be estimated for each value of J,1. A contour
plot of the constitutive law (48) parametrized by the obtained value of anw could therefore be drawn,
see Figure 9. Indeed it qualitatively resembles the one traced in [64, Figure 11], for the values of the

saturation degree which have been considered in the present analysis. However it is worth to notice that
the considered deformation and ﬂow regimes are totally diﬀerent with respect to those simulated by [64],
as they are driven by the gradient of the Jacobian J, at diﬀerent values of Sr, whilst those ones of [64] are
deduced simulating many scanning loops of drainage and imbibition. This is indeed an interesting point
which corroborates the idea, introduced in the seminal paper of [59], of resolving the hysteresis of the
capillary pressure, between drainage and imbibition, introducing a suitable micro-structural parameter,
say anw, which tunes the value of Pc for each value of Sr.

For the considered values of the saturation degree, the distribution of the interfacial area is plotted

reported in [28], [39] and [40]. Comparing the envisaged relation with that one deduced by [40, Figure
10b] and [39, Figure 7b] one can notice that consistency with the experimental data is achieved when
the capillary pressure is not too large, in particular not larger than a suitable inversion point, see [40,

for the considered distribution of the liquid phase within the RVE during the deformation process. Again
a comparison with the experimental result of [40] and [39] conﬁrms the validity of the obtained results
for the considered range of values of Sr and Pc.

Figure 11: Linear regression of data relative to the calculated admissible values of Sr and anw, deduced
from the micro-scale analysis.

The considered micro-scale analysis showed an a-posteriori relation between the average interfacial
area anw and the gradient of the liquid content, in the presence of a non-trivial ﬂow through the boundary
of the RVE. As the average interfacial area is typically parametrized by the pore size distribution, the
higher order constitutive parameter Ck should also depend on it so that the more the collection of pores,
forming the RVE, is non-uniform, the more the micro-scale deformations of the skeleton will aﬀect the
retention properties of the porous material. The pore size polydispersity is therefore expected to highly
aﬀect the corrective term to Pc reported in equation (48) (the higher the polydispersity, the larger the
gradient corrective term).

It is worth to underline that the considered micro-scale analysis stems from the assumption of non-
negligible strain gradients, which in fact parametrize the deformation process, even if only small strain

would abruptly simplify into the standard constitutive prescription of capillary pressure.

7. Governing equations

Restrictions due to thermodynamics have provided a consistent representation of the overall free
energy of the porous continuum Ψ, as the sum of the free energy of the skeleton and the interfaces Ψs
and that of the bulk ﬂuid Ψf , weighted by Lagrangian porosity, in terms of strain, Lagrangian porosity,
saturation degree, strain gradient and gradient of liquid content. This characterization has been deduced
postulating the balance of momentum for the overall porous medium, and exploiting the Clausius-Duhem
inequality; the constitutive prescription of the local ﬂuid ﬂux, say the generalized Darcy law, has also been
obtained. However no explicit deduction of the boundary conditions relative to the partial diﬀerential
equations associated to the overall equilibrium (7) and the generalized Richards equation (43) or (45)
have been stated.

In this section the governing equations, and the corresponding boundary conditions, for an unsaturated
porous medium, within the framework of the adopted regularized phase ﬁeld model, are deduced by means
of a variational approach. To do this the independent variations of χα, gk and φ, ∀X ∈ D0, are taken
into account. Let
χ∗
α (X, t) = χα (X, t) + δχα (X, t) ,

g∗
j (X, t) = gj (X, t) + δgj (X, t) , φ∗ (X, t) = φ (X, t) + δφ (X, t) ,
(52)
be the varied ﬁelds, and δχα, δgk and δφ the corresponding arbitrary variations. The physical meaning
of the variation δχα is well known in continuum mechanics and stands for the virtual displacement
(deformation) of the solid skeleton. In the following this variation will also be indicated as δu, which
corresponds to the varied displacement ﬁeld u∗. The variation δgk, instead, accounts for the virtual
relative displacement of a ﬂuid material particle with respect to a solid one. The variation δφ ﬁnally
indicates the local change of Lagrangian porosity. All these variations are evaluated keeping ﬁxed X ∈ D0,
therefore δ commutes with the Lagrangian gradient operator and can enter the integral over D0.

Following the statements of classical mechanics, the principle of virtual working reads

(53)
where δA represents the Lagrangian variation of the action functional deﬁned, neglecting inertia eﬀects,
as

δA = − δLext − δLdiss

(54)
while δLdiss and δLext are the virtual working due to dissipative forces and the virtual working of external
forces, respectively. The virtual working of dissipative forces is

The local governing equations are deduced by requiring the validity of equation (53) for every kine-

natural (n) boundary conditions needs to be generalized, following the scheme proposed in [43]. On every

placement χ of the solid particles is used and (Dnu)α := uα,k nk and (Dng)j := gj,k nk indicate the nor-
mal derivatives of u and g along the outward normal to ∂D0. Subscripts distinguish (u, g)-essential from
t-natural boundary conditions, whilst superscripts distinguish Dn(u, g)-essential from τ -natural boundary
conditions; moreover on every part of the h-th edge Eh the standard distinction between essential and
natural conditions holds true. The varied maps u∗ and g∗ are said to be kinematically admissible if they
satisfy the same essential boundary conditions as u and g; as a consequence the variations δu and δg

8. Conclusions

In this paper gradient theory of poromechanics endowed with phase ﬁeld modeling have been used
to describe partial saturation. The spatial distribution of saturation and strain is spatially regularized,
in the presence of phase coexistence, within the non-uniform ﬂuid, and in the neighbors of possible
heterogeneities in the porous skeleton. To do this the free energy of the overall porous medium has been
regarded as a function not only of strain and saturation but also on their (Lagrangian) gradients.

As usual in gradient theories, the governing partial diﬀerential equations relative, in this case, to the
solid skeleton and the non-uniform ﬂuid are deduced using integration by parts twice, which implies the
equations to be, in the general case, of the fourth order. In particular an enhanced version of classical
Richards’ equation has been deduced from generalized Darcy’s law, which in the considered regime of
partial saturation does not depend on the capillary pressure, but on the so-called generalized eﬀective
chemical potential.

Moreover a novel constitutive characterization of the capillary pressure is established and a micro-scale
interpretation is provided, which is consistent with that originally formulated by [58, 59]. A comparison
with experimental results also conﬁrms that the contribution to capillary pressure due to saturation
gradient allows for recovering similar eﬀects as those captured by the average interfacial area.

23

In particular the model proposed in this paper aims at bridging the regularizing eﬀects provided by
the gradient of strain and the gradient of saturation in order to capture on one hand the response of
the porous skeleton, due to micro-scale multi-phase ﬂow, and on the other hand the heterogeneous and
possibly anisotropic ﬂow of the saturating ﬂuids due to localized strains, induced by micro-structural
remodeling processes. Further developments will be carried out in order to account for damaging and
plastic strain.

The extended form of Bishop’s stress can therefore be deﬁned as follows:

(B.4)
which indeed coincides with that given in equation (38), once the hypothesis of small deformations has
been stated.

Appendix C

The liquid, initially trapped within the beads, is assumed to be squeezed out because of the mutual
displacement of the beads, so that the macro-scale gradient of φSr has the same direction as that of J
and the liquid reaches the boundary of the RVE. In particular the displaced conﬁguration of the liquid,
associated to a non-vanishing gradient of J (along the X1 direction) is obtained assuming the interfaces
between the liquid and the wet air to keep a constant contact angle with the solid grains and to maintain
a circumferential shape, see Figure 5.
Let 2α be the central angle relative to any of the circumferential arches which characterize the reference
shape of the liquid, moreover let β (or π−β) be the azimuthal angle of the junction line among the liquid,
the wet air and the solid grain, with respect to the center of each bead; the contact angle θ is therefore
2 − α + β, see Figure 12. Apparently, once ﬁxed the amount of the trapped liquid, the central angles
θ = π

26

Figure 12: Detail of the refence conﬁguration B0 of the RVE; the domain occupied by the liquid is
parametrized by the three non-independent angles α, β and θ.

α and the the angles β, relative to the four circumferential interfaces in the reference conﬁguration of the
RVE are the same. For the sake of convenience the circumferential interfaces between the liquid and the
wet air are labeled as North (N), East (E), South (S) and West (W)-Arch, respectively, turning clockwise
from the North.

Due to the displacement of the beads centers, given by equation (49)the centers of the E-Arch and
the W-Arch are displaced in the direction of the gradient of J. Their curvatures change so as to keep
constant the contact angle θ at the junction line, and in particular the curvature of the E-Arch decreases,
as it is pulled out of the intergranular space, whilst that of the W-Arch increases, as it is pushed inwards
it. Notice that some liquid must be ejected from the pore chamber so as to make consistent the placement
of the W-Arch with the requirement of displacing the liquid to the boundary of the RVE, keeping ﬁxed
the contact angle, see Figure 5. Finally in order to guarantee a constant value of the ratio between
the amount of liquid (in volume) and the volume of the pore space, say of the degree of saturation, the
N-Arch and the S-Arch are displaced and rotated keeping their curvatures almost constant during the
deformation process.

Thus the problem of ﬁnding out the current placement of the liquid particles can be formulated as
follows: given the third order tensor A determine the β-angles relative to the N-Arch, the E-Arch and
the W-Arch as well as the value of the spherical part of the macro-scale deformation gradient, a, so that
the saturation degree remains constant during deformation and the amount (in volume) of liquid initially
trapped within the beads equals the amount (in volume) of the displaced liquid. Apparently in order to
force the liquid to squeeze out of the pore chamber, a negative value of a should be obtained.

Appendix D

Following the microporomechanics approach summarized by [48] the macro-scale gradient of Gli is
li relative to the liquid phase,

calculated starting from the deﬁnition of Gli as the apparent average of Gm
see equation (51)2; consequently on has:

where f (Z) is a C∞ function deﬁned, at the micro-scale, on the entire Euclidean space of positions, which
is equal to zero outside the reference conﬁguration of the RVE, and is normalized so that its integral over
the entire space is equal to one. The integral in equation (D.1) is calculated with respect to Z variables.
In equations (50)-(51) this function has been assumed to tend to the characteristic function of B0 divided
by its volume. Finally H 0
liq(Z) is the characteristic function of the liquid, in the reference conﬁguration
of the solid, which is also deﬁned on the entire space of positions.

According with equation (D.2), even if a complete statement of the displacement of the liquid is
not explicitly formulated, the macroscopic gradient of the liquid content φSr can be deduced from the
micro-scale, assuming a suitable form of the gradient of gm only over ∂(D0
f . Let the RVE be
that of the left panel of Figure 5, the only part of the boundary of B0 which provides a non-vanishing
contribution to Gli,k, and therefore to (φSr),k is the right intergranular channel, which means that one
only needs an instance on how the map gm transforms a thin neighborhood of this part of the boundary
into the corresponding domain of the initial conﬁguration of the liquid.
