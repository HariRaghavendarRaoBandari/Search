Abstract

In this paper, we argue that quantum coherence in a bipartite system can be contained either

locally or in the correlations between the subsystems. The portion of quantum coherence contained

within correlations can be viewed as a kind quantum correlation which we call correlated coher-

ence. We demonstrate that the framework provided by correlated coherence allows us retrieve the

same concepts of quantum correlations as deﬁned by the asymmetric and symmetrized versions of

quantum discord as well as quantum entanglement, thus providing a uniﬁed view of these correla-

tions. We also prove that correlated coherence can be formulated as an entanglement monotone,

thus demonstrating that entanglement may be viewed as a specialized form of coherence.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum mechanics admit a superposition between diﬀerent physical states. A super-

posed quantum state is described by a pure state and is completely diﬀerent in nature to

a classical stochastic mixture of states, otherwise called mixed states. In the parlance of

quantum mechanics, the former is usually referred to as a coherent superposition, the latter

one as a incoherent classical mixture.

A particularly illuminating example of quantum coherence in action is the classic double

slit experiment.

In the quantum version, a single electron, passing through a double slit

one at a time and upon emerging, forms an interference fringe despite not interacting with

any other electron. An explanation of this phenomena requires a coherent superposition

of two travelling waves emerging from both slits. Such an eﬀect is impossible to explain

using only incoherent classical mixtures. Following the birth of quantum theory, physical

demonstrations of quantum coherence arising from superpositions of many diﬀerent quantum

systems such as electrons, photons, atoms, mechanical modes, and hybrid systems have been

achieved [1–3].

Recent developments in our understanding of quantum coherence have come from the bur-

geoning ﬁeld of quantum information science. One important area of study that quantum

information researchers concern themselves with is the understanding of quantum correla-

tions. It turns out that in a multipartite setting, quantum mechanical eﬀects allows remote

laboratories to collaborate and perform tasks that would otherwise be impossible using

classical physics [4]. Historically, the most well studied quantum correlation is quantum en-

tanglement [5–7]. Subsequent developments of the idea lead to the formulation of quantum

discord [8, 12], and its symmetrized version [9–11] as more generalized forms of quantum

correlations that includes quantum entanglement. The development of such ideas of the

quantumness of correlations has lead to a plethora of quantum protocols such as quantum

cryptography [13], quantum teleportation [14], quantum superdense coding [15], quantum

random access codes [16], remote state preparation [17], random number generation[18], and

quantum computing [19, 21], amongst others. Quantum correlations have also proven useful

in the study of macroscopic quantum objects [20].

Meanwhile, quantitative theories for entanglement [22, 23] have been formulated by char-

acterizing and quantifying entanglement as a resource to achieve certain tasks that are oth-

2

erwise impossible classically. Building upon this, Baumgratz et al. [24] recently proposed a

resource theory of quantum coherence. Recent developments has since unveiled interesting

connections between quantum coherence and correlation, such as their interconversion with

each other [25, 26] and trade-oﬀ relations [27].

In this paper, we demonstrate that quantum correlation can be understood in terms of

the coherence contained solely between subsystems. In contrast to previous studies which

established indirect relationships between quantum correlation and coherence [25–27], our

study establishes a more direct connection between the two and provides a uniﬁed view of

quantum correlations which includes quantum discord and entanglement using the frame-

work of quantum coherence.

II. PRELIMINARIES

A. Bipartite system and local basis

In this paper, we will frequently refer to a bipartite state which we denote ρAB, where A

and B refer to local subsystems held by diﬀerent laboratories. Following convention, we say

the subsystems A and B are held by Alice and Bob respectively. The local state of Alice

is obtained by performing a partial trace on ρAB, and is denoted by ρA = TrB(ρAB), and
{|iiA} is a complete local basis of Alice’s system. Bob’s local state and local basis are also
similarly deﬁned. In general, the systems Alice and Bob holds may be composite, such that
A = A1A2 · · · AN and B = B1B2 · · · BM so the total state may identically be denoted by
ρA1A2···AN B1B2···BM .

B. Quantum coherence

We will adopt the axiomatic approach for coherene measures as shown in Ref. [24]. For
a ﬁxed basis set {|ii}, the set of incoherent states I is the set of quantum states with
diagonal density matrices with respect to this basis. Then a reasonable measure of quantum
coherence C should satisfy following properties: (C1) C(ρ) ≥ 0 for any quantum states ρ
and equality holds if and only if ρ ∈ I. (C2a) Non-increasing under incoherent completely
positive and trace preserving maps (ICPTP) Φ , i.e., C(ρ) ≥ C(Φ(ρ)). (C2b) Monotonicity
for average coherence under selective outcomes of ICPTP: C(ρ) ≥Pn pnC(ρn), where ρn =

n/pn and pn = Tr[ ˆKnρ ˆK †

ˆKn ˆK †

n = 1 and ˆKnI ˆK †

n] for all ˆKn with Pn

ˆKnρ ˆK †
n ⊆ I. (C3)
Convexity, i.e., λC(ρ) + (1 − λ)C(σ) ≥ C(λρ + (1 − λ)σ), for any density matrix ρ and σ
with 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. In this paper, we will employ the l1-norm of coherence, which is deﬁned by
C (ρ) :=Pi6=j |hi|ρ|ji|, for any given basis set {|ii} (otherwise called the reference basis). It

can be shown that this deﬁnition satisﬁes all the properties mentioned [24].

C. Local operations and classical communication (LOCC)

In addition, we will also reference local operations and classical communication (LOCC)

protocols in the context of the resource theory of entanglement. LOCC protocols allow

for two diﬀerent types of operation. First, Alice and Bob are allowed to perform quantum

operations, but only locally on their respective subsystems. Second, they are also allowed

classical, but otherwise unrestricted communication between them. LOCC operations are

especially important in the characterization of quantum entanglement, which typically does

not increase under such operations. Measures of entanglement satisfying this are referred to

as LOCC monotones [28].

III. MAXIMAL COHERENCE LOSS

Before establishing the connection between quantum correlation and coherence, we ﬁrst

consider the measurement that leads to the maximal coherence lost in the system of interest.

For a monopartite system, the solution to this is trivial. For any quantum state ρ =

Pi,j ρi,j|iihj| with a reference basis {|ii}, it is clear that the measurement that maximally
removes coherence from the system is the projective measurement Π(ρ) = Pi |iihi|ρ|iihi|.
This measurement leaves behind only the diagonal terms of ρ, so C (Π(ρ)) = 0, which is the
minimum coherence any state can have.

A less obvious result for a bipartite state is the following:

Proposition 1. For any bipartite state ρAB = Pi,j,k,l ρi,j,k,l |i, jiAB hk, l| where the co-
herence is measured with respect to the local reference bases {|iiA} and {|jiB}, the pro-
jective measurement on subsystem B that induces maximal coherence loss is ΠB(ρAB) =

Pj (11A ⊗ |jiB hj|) ρAB (11A ⊗ |jiB hj|).

4

Proof. We begin by using the spectral decomposition of a general bipartite quantum state

ρAB =Pn pn |ψniAB hψn|. Assume that the subsystems have local reference bases {|iiA} and
k,l)∗ |i, jiAB hk, l|. The coherence of the system is
{|jiB} such that ρAB =PnPi,j,k,l pnψn
measured with respect to these bases. To reduce clutter, we remove the subscripts pertaining

i,j(ψn

to the subsystems AB for the remainder of the proof. Unless otherwise stated, it should be

clear from the context which subsystem every operator belong to.

Consider some complete basis on B, {|λmi}, and the corresponding projective measure-
ment ΠB(ρ) = Pm(11 ⊗ |λmihλm|) ρ (11 ⊗ |λmihλm|). Computing the matrix elements, we

get:

Note that minimizing the absolute sum of all the matrix elements will also minimize

the coherence, since the diagonal elements of any density matrix always sums to 1 and are

non-negative. Consider the absolute sum of all the matrix elements of ΠB(ρ):

Since any N-partite state ρA1A2...AN ,

is allowed to perform a bipartition such that

ρA1A2...AN = ρA′AN where A′ = A1 . . . AN −1, we also get the following corollary:

Corollary 1.1. For any N-partite state ρA1A2...AN where the coherence is measured with
respect to the local reference bases {|iiAk} and k = 1, 2, . . . , N, then the projective measure-
ment on subsystem Ak that induces maximal coherence loss is the projective measurement
onto the local basis {|iiAk}.

IV. LOCAL AND CORRELATED COHERENCE

Now consider a bipartite state ρAB, with total coherence C (ρAB) with respect to local
reference bases {|iiA} and {|jiB}. Then C (ρA) can be interpreted as the coherence that is
local to A. Similarly, C (ρB) is the portion of the coherence that is local to B. In general,
the sum of the total local coherences is not necessarily the same as the total coherence in

the system. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that a portion of the quantum coherences

are not stored locally, but within the correlations of the system itself.

Deﬁnition 1 (Correlated Coherence). With respect to local reference bases {|iiA} and
{|jiB}, Correlated Coherence for a bipartite quantum system is given by subtracting local
coherences from the total coherence:

Ccc (ρAB) := C (ρAB) − C (ρA) − C (ρB)

Where ρA and ρB are the reduced density matrices of A and B respectively.

6

Further reinforcing the idea that the local coherences form only a portion of the total

coherence present in a quantum system, we prove the following property:

Theorem 1. For any bipartite quantum state ρAB, Ccc (ρAB) ≥ 0 (i.e. Correlated Coherence
is always non-negative).

V. CORRELATED COHERENCE AND QUANTUM DISCORD

Of particular interest to the study of quantum correlations is the idea that certain correla-

tions are quantum and certain correlations are classical. In this section, we will demonstrate

that Correlated Coherence is able to unify many of these concepts of quantumness under

the same framework.

First, note that in our deﬁnition of Correlated Coherence, the choice of reference bases is

not unique, while most deﬁnitions of quantum correlations are independent of speciﬁc basis

choices. However, we can retrieve basis independence via a very natural choice of local bases.
For every bipartite state ρAB, the reduced density matrices ρA and ρB has eigenbases {|αii}
and {|βii} respectively. By choosing these local bases, ρA and ρB are both diagonal and the

7

local coherences are zero. The implication of this is that for such a choice, the coherence

in the system is stored entirely within the correlations. Since this can be done for any ρAB,

Correlated Coherence with respect to these bases becomes a state dependent property as

required. For the rest of the paper, unless otherwise stated, we will assume that the choice

of local bases for the calculation of Correlated Coherence will always be the local eigenbases

of Alice and Bob.

We ﬁrst consider the deﬁnition of a quantum correlation in the symmetrized version of

quantum discord. Under the framework of symmetric discord, a state contains quantum

correlations when it cannot be expressed in the form ρAB =Pi,j pi,j |iiA hi|⊗|jiB hj|, where
{|iiA} and {|jiB} are sets of orthonormal vectors. Any such state has zero symmetric discord
by deﬁnition.

We prove the following theorem:

Theorem 2 (Correlated Coherence and Symmetric Quantum Discord). For a given state

ρAB, Ccqc (ρAB) = 0 iﬀ ρAB =Pi,j pi,j |iiA hi| ⊗ |jiB hj|.
Proof. If {|iiA} and {|jiB} are the the eigenbases of ρA and ρB, then Ccqc (ρAB) = 0 implies
C (ρAB) = 0 which implies ρAB only has diagonal terms, so ρAB =Pi,j pi,j |iiA hi| ⊗ |jiB hj|.
Therefore, Ccqc (ρAB) = 0 =⇒ ρAB =Pi,j pi,j |iiA hi| ⊗ |jiB hj|.
Conversely, if ρAB =Pi,j pi,j |iiA hi| ⊗ |jiB hj|, then the state clearly has zero coherence,
which implies Ccqc (ρAB) = 0, so the converse is also true. This proves the theorem.

This establishes a relationship between Correlated Coherence and symmetric discord. We

now consider the asymmetric version of quantum discord. Under this framework, a state

contains quantum correlations when it cannot be expressed in the form ρAB =Pi pi |iiA hi|⊗

B is some normalized density matrix.

B, where ρj
ρi

We prove the following:

Theorem 3 (Correlated Coherence and Asymmetric Quantum Discord). For a given state
ρAB, let {|iiA} and {|jiB} be the the eigenbases of ρA and ρB respectively. Deﬁne the mea-
surement on A onto the local basis as ΠA(ρAB) :=Pi(|iiA hi|⊗ 11B)ρAB(|iiA hi|⊗ 11B). Then,
with respect to these local bases, Ccqc (ρAB)−Ccqc (ΠA(ρAB)) = 0 iﬀ ρAB =Pi pi |iiA hi|⊗ ρi
B,
B is some normalized density matrix and {|iiA} is some set of orthonormal vectors.

where ρi

8

Proof. First, we write the state in the form ρAB =Pi,j,k,l ρijkl |i, jiAB hk, l|. We can always
write the state in block matrix form such that ρAB = Pi,k |iiA hk| ⊗ ρi,k
Pj,k ρijkl |jiB hl|. If {|iiA} and {|jiB} are the the eigenbases of ρA and ρB, then Ccqc (ρAB)−
Ccqc (ΠA(ρAB)) = 0 implies that when i 6= k, ρi,k
B = 0. This implies ρAB = Pi |iiA hi| ⊗ ρi,i
By deﬁning ρi

B /pi where pi := Trρi,i

B where ρi,k

B = ρi,i

B :=

B .

Ccqc (ρAB) − Ccqc (ΠA(ρAB)) = 0 =⇒ ρAB =Pi pi |iiA hi| ⊗ ρi
For the converse, if ρAB =Pi pi |iiA hi|⊗ρi
Ccqc (ΠA(ρAB)) = 0. This completes the proof.

B , we get ρAB = Pi pi |iiA hi| ⊗ ρi
B, then clearly, ΠA(ρAB) = ρAB, so Ccqc (ρAB)−

B. Therefore,

B.

Note that the above relationship with asymmetric quantum discord is expressed as a dif-

ference between the Correlated Coherence of ρAB and the post measurement state ΠA(ρAB).

While this characterization of quantum correlations may at ﬁrst appear to diverge from
the one given in Theorem 3, they are actually similar since Ccqc (ΠAΠB(ρAB)) = 0 so
Ccqc (ρAB) = Ccqc (ρAB) − Ccqc (ΠAΠB(ρAB)). It is therefore possible to interpret quantum
discord as the correlated coherence loss when either party performs a maximally coherence

destroying measurement only their subsystems (See Proposition 1). When the projective

measurement is performed only on one side, one retrieves the asymmetric version of quantum

discord, and the symmetrized version is obtained when the coherence destroying measure-

ment is performed by both parties.

VI. CORRELATED COHERENCE AND ENTANGLEMENT

Under the framework of entangled correlations, a state contains quantum correlations

when it cannot be expressed as a convex combination of product states Pi pi |αiiA hαi| ⊗
|βiiB hβi|, where |αii and |βii are normalized but not necessarily orthogonal vectors that can
repeat. It is also possible to extend our methodology to entangled quantum states. In order

to do this, we consider extensions of the quantum state ρAB. We say that a state ρABC is an

extension of ρAB if TrC(ρABC) = ρAB. For our purpose, we will consider extensions of the

form ρAA′BB ′.

Theorem 4. Let ρAA′BB ′ be some extension of a bipartite state ρAB and choose the local

bases to be the eigenbases of ρAA′ and ρBB ′ respectively. Then with respect to these local

bases, minCcqc (ρAA′BB ′) = 0 iﬀ ρAB =Pi pi |αiiA hαi|⊗|βiiB hβi| for some set of normalized

9

vectors |αii and |βii that are not necessarily orthogonal and may repeat. The minimization
is over all possible extensions of ρAB of the form ρAA′BB ′.

A ⊗ ρj

A := TrA′(|µiiAA′ hµi|) and ρj

Proof. If inf Ccqc (ρAA′BB ′) = 0, then ρAA′BB ′ must have the form Pi,j pi,j |µiiAA′ hµi| ⊗
|νjiBB ′ hνj| (See Thm. 2). Since ρAA′BB ′ is an extension, TrA′TrB ′(ρAA′BB ′) =Pi,j pi,jTrA′(|µiiAA′ hµi|)⊗
TrB ′(|νjiBB ′ hνj|) = ρAB. Let ρi
B := TrB ′(|νjiBB ′ hνj|). Then,
ρAB = Pi,j pi,jρi
B. This is equivalent to saying ρAB = Pi pi |αiiA hαi| ⊗ |βiiB hβi|,
for some set of (non necessarily orthogonal) vectors {|αii} and {|βii}. This proves
minCcqc (ρAA′BB ′) = 0 =⇒ ρAB =Pi pi |αiiA hαi| ⊗ |βiiB hβi|
For the converse, suppose ρAB = Pi pi |αiiA hαi| ⊗ |βiiB hβi|, consider the puriﬁcation
of ρAB of the form |ψiABA′B ′C ′ = Pi √pi |αiiA |βiiB |iiA′ |iiB ′ |iiC ′. Since this is a puriﬁ-
cation, ρAA′BB ′ = TrC ′(|ψiABA′B ′C ′ hψ|) is clearly an extension of ρAB. Furthermore, the
eigenbases of ρAA′ and ρBB ′ are {|αiiA |iiA′} and {|βiiB |iiB ′} respectively. Since ρAA′BB ′ =
Pi pi |αiiA |iiA′ hαi|Ahi|A′ ⊗|βiiB |iiB ′ hβi|Bhi|B ′, Ccqc (ρAA′BB ′) = 0 with respect to the eigen-
bases of ρAA′ and ρBB ′. Therefore, minCcqc (ρAA′BB ′) = 0, which completes the proof.

VII. COHERENCE AS AN ENTANGLEMENT MONOTONE

We now construct an entanglement monotone using the Correlated Coherence of a quan-

tum state.

In order to do this, we ﬁrst deﬁne symmetric extensions of a given quantum

state:

Deﬁnition 2 (Unitarily Symmetric Extensions). Let ρAA′BB ′ be an extension of a bipartite

state ρAB. The extension ρAA′BB ′ is said to be unitarily symmetric if it remains invariant

up to local unitaries on AA′ and BB′ under a system swap between Alice and Bob.

More formally, let {|iiAA′} and {|iiBB ′} be complete local bases on AA′ and BB′ respec-
:= |j, iiAA′BB ′ . Then ρAA′BB ′
tively. Deﬁne the swap operator through Uswap |i, jiAA′BB ′
is unitarily symmetric if there exists local unitary operations UAA′ and UBB ′ such that

UAA′ ⊗ UBB ′(cid:0)UswapρAA′BB ′U †

swap(cid:1) U †

AA′ ⊗ U †

BB ′ = ρAA′BB ′.

Following from the observation that the minimization of coherence over all extensions is

closely related to the the separability of a quantum state, we deﬁne the following:

Deﬁnition 3. Let ρAA′BB ′ be some extension of a bipartite state ρAB and choose the local

10

bases to be the eigenbases of ρAA′ and ρBB ′ respectively. Then the entanglement of coherence

(EOC) is deﬁned to be:

Ecqc(ρAB) := min Ccqc (ρAA′BB ′)

The minimization is over all possible unitarily symmetric extensions of ρAB of the form

ρAA′BB ′.

It remains to be proven that Ecqc(ρAB) is a valid measure of entanglement (i.e.

it is an

entanglement monotone). But ﬁrst, we prove the following elementary properties.

Proposition 2 (EOC of Separable States). If a bipartite quantum state ρAB is separable,

Ecqc (ρAB) = 0.

Proof. The proof is identical to Thm. 4, with the additional observation that ρAA′BB ′ =

Pi,j pi,j |µiiAA′ hµi| ⊗ |νjiBB ′ hνj|
Pi |νiiAA′ hµi| and UBB ′ :=Pi |µiiAA′ hνi|. It is easy to verify that is satisﬁes

is unitarily symmetric. To see this, deﬁne UAA′

:=

BB ′ = ρAA′BB ′

UAA′ ⊗ UBB ′(cid:0)UswapρAA′BB ′U †

swap(cid:1) U †

AA′ ⊗ U †

where Uswap is the same as in Def. 2 so it is unitarily symmetric.

Proposition 3 (Invariance under local unitaries). For a bipartite quantum state ρAB,

Ecqc(ρAB) is invariant under local unitary operations on A and B

Proof. Without loss in generality, we only need to prove it is invariant under local unitary

operations of A.

For some bipartite state ρAB, let ρ∗

AA′BB ′ be the optimal unitarily symmetric extension

such that Ecqc (ρAB) = Ccqc (ρ∗
AA′BB ′). Let |iiAA′ and |jiBB ′ be the eigenbases of ρ∗
BB ′ respectively. With respect to these bases, ρ∗
ρ∗
AA′BB ′ =Pijkl ρijkl |i, jiAA′BB ′ hk, l|
Suppose we perform a unitary U = UA ⊗ 11A′BB ′ on A such that so U |i, ji = |αi, ji
AA′BB ′U † =Pijkl ρijkl |αi, jiAA′BB ′ hαk, l|, it is
where {|αii} is an orthonormal set. Since Uρ∗

Since Ecqc is a minimization over all unitarily symmetric extensions, we have λEcqc (ρAB)+

Proposition 5 (Contraction under partial trace). Consider the bipartite state ρAB where

A = A1A2 is a composite system. Then the entanglement of coherence is non-increasing

under a partial trace:

Ecqc (ρA1A2B) ≥ Ecqc (TrA1(ρA1A2B))

Or, if A is a composite system, A = A1A2

Ecqc (ρAB) ≥ Ecqc (ΠA(ρAB))

Ecqc (ρAB) ≥ Ecqc (ΠA1(ρA1A2B))

Proof. First, we observe that any projective measurement can be performed via a CNOT

type operation with an ancilla, followed by tracing out the ancilla:

ρii |iiY hi|.

The unitary performs the operation U CNOT

|0, iiXY = |i, iiXY . Since adding an uncorre-
lated ancilla does not increase Ecqc , we have Ecqc(cid:0)|0iA3 h0| ⊗ ρA1A2B(cid:1) = Ecqc (ρA1A2B). As

Ecqc is invariant under local unitaries (Prop. 3) and contractive under partial trace (Prop. 5),

XY

this proves the proposition.

Proposition 7 (Invariance under classical communication). For a bipartite state ρAB, Sup-

pose that on Alice’s side, A = A1A2 is a composite system and A1 is a classical registry

storing classical information. Then Eeqc remains invariant if a copy of A1 is created on

Bob’s side.

More formally, let ρA1A2B2 = Pi pi |iiA1 hi| ⊗ |ψiiA2B2 hψi| be the initial state, and let
σA1A2B1B2 = Pi pi |iiA1 hi| ⊗ |ψiiA2B2 hψi| ⊗ |iiB1 hi| be the state after Alice communicates a

copy of A1 to Bob, then

Ecqc (ρA1A2B2) = Ecqc (σA1A2B1B2)

Proof. Let Ξswap

through local unitaries, gain access to the information in A1, copy it to B′′ by performing

locally, and then undo the swap operation via another set of local unitary operations.

This means there must exist VA1A2A′A′′ and VB1B2B ′B ′′ such that:

this state is equivalent to σA1A2B1B2 as deﬁned previously, it is also a unitarily symmetric

extension of σA1A2B1B2. Since Ccqc is invariant under local unitary operations, we have

Ecqc (ρA1A2B2) = Ecqc(cid:0)ρ∗

A1A2A′BB ′(cid:1)

where the last inequality comes from the fact that the entanglement of coherence is a mini-

mization over all unitarily symmetric extensions. On the other hand, a unitarily symmetric
extension of σA1A2B1B2 is also an unitarily symmetric extension of ρA1A2B2 so Ecqc (ρA1A2B2) ≤
Ecqc (σA1A2B1B2). This implies that ρA1A2B2 so Ecqc (ρA1A2B2) = Ecqc (σA1A2B1B2) which com-

pletes the proof.

Proposition 8 (Contraction under LOCC). For any bipartite state ρAB and let ΛLOCC be

any LOCC protocol performed between A and B. Then Ecqc is non-increasing under such

operations:

Ecqc (ρAB) ≥ Ecqc (ΛLOCC(ρAB))

Proof. We consider the scenario where Alice performs a POVM on her subsystems, com-

municates classical information of her meaurement outcomes to Bob, who then performs a

separate operation on his subsystem based on this measurement information.

14

Suppose Alice and Bob begins with the state ρA1B1. By Naimark’s theorem, any POVM

can be performed through a unitary interaction between the state of interest and an uncor-

related pure state ancilla, followed by a projective measurement on the ancilla and ﬁnally

tracing out the ancillary systems. In order to facilitate Alice and Bob’s performing of such

quantum operations, we add uncorrelated ancillas to the state, which does not change the en-

tanglement of coherence so Ecqc (ρA1B1) = Ecqc(cid:0)|0, 0iMAA2 h0, 0| ⊗ ρA1B1 ⊗ |0, 0iMBB2 h0, 0|(cid:1).

For Alice’s procedure, we will assume the projection is performed on MA, so MA is a classical

register storing classical measurement outcomes.

In the beginning, Alice performs a unitary operation on subsystems MAA1A2, followed

by a projection on MA which makes it classical. We represent the composite of these two

operations with ΩA, which represents Alice’s local operation. Since Ecqc is invariant under

local unitaries (Prop. 3) but contractive under a projection (Prop. 5), ΩA is a contractive

operation.

The next part of the procedure is a communication of classical bits to Bob. This proce-

dure equivalent to the copying of the state of the classical register MA to the register MB.

However, Ecqc is invariant under such communication (Prop. 7). We represent this opera-

tion as ΓA→B. The next step requires Bob to perform an operation on his quantum system

based on the communicated bits. He can achieve this by performing a unitary operation on

subsystems MBB1B2. We represent this operation with ΩB, which does not change Ecqc.

The ﬁnal step of the procedure requires tracing out the ancillas, TrMAA2MBB2, which is again

contractive (Prop. 5).

Since every step is either contractive or invariant, we have the following inequality:

Ecqc (ρA1B1) = Ecqc(cid:0)|0, 0iMAA2 h0, 0| ⊗ ρA1B1 ⊗ |0, 0iMBB2 h0, 0|(cid:1)

≥ Ecqc(cid:0)TrMAA2MBB2 ◦ ΩB ◦ ΓA→B ◦ ΩA(cid:2)|0, 0iMAA2 h0, 0| ⊗ ρA1B1 ⊗ |0, 0iMBB2 h0, 0|(cid:3)(cid:1) .

Any LOCC protocol is a series of such procedures from Alice to Bob or from Bob to Alice,
so we must have Ecqc (ρAB) ≥ Ecqc (ΛLOCC(ρAB)), which completes the proof.

The following theorem shows that the entanglement of coherence is a valid measure of

the entanglement of the system.

Theorem 5 (Entanglement monotone). The entanglement of coherence Ecqc is an entan-

glement monotone in the sense that it satisﬁes:

15

1. Ecqc (ρAB) = 0 iﬀ Ecqc (ρAB) is seperable.

2. Ecqc (ρAB) is invariant under local unitaries on A and B.

3. Ecqc (ρAB) ≥ Ecqc (ΛLOCC(ρAB)) for any LOCC procedure ΛLOCC.

Proof. It follows directly from Prop. 2 and Prop. 3 and 8.

VIII. CONCLUSION

To conclude, we deﬁned the Correlated Coherence of quantum states as the total co-

herence without local coherences, which can be interpreted as the portion of the coherence

that is shared between 2 quantum subsystems. The framework of the Correlated Coher-

ence allows us to identify the same concepts of non-classicality of correlations as those of

(both symmetric and asymmetric) quantum discord and quantum entanglement. Finally,

we proved that the minimization of the Correlated Coherence over all symmetric extensions

of a quantum state is an entanglement monotone, showing that quantum entanglement may

be interpreted as a specialized form of coherence. Our results suggest that quantum correla-

tions in general may be understood from the viewpoint of coherence, thus possibly opening

new ways of understanding both.
