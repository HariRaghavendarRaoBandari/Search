Abstract. In this paper, we introduce the notions of pointwise rough statistical
convergence and rough statistically Cauchy sequences of real valued functions in
the line of A. (T¨urkmenoglu) G¨okhan and M. G¨ung¨or [6]. Furthermore we study
thier equivalence.

Key words and phrases : Pointwise rough statistical convergence, rough statistically

Cauchy sequence.

1. Introduction:

The idea of statistical convergence was ﬁrst introduced by Fast [3] and also by
Schoenberg[14] independently, using the idea of natural density. Let K be a subset of
the set of positive integers N. Let Kn be a set deﬁned as follows, Kn = {k ∈ K : k ≤ n}.
|Kn|
n , where |Kn| denotes the
Then the natural density of K is deﬁned as d(K) = lim
n→∞
number of elements in Kn. Clearly ﬁnite set has natural density zero.
A real sequence {xn}n∈N is said to be pointwise statistically convergent ti ξ on a set S
if for every ε > 0,

|{k ≤ n : |xn − ξ| ≥ ε for ξ ∈ S}| = 0.

lim
n→∞

The idea of rough convergence was introduced by Phu [12] in ﬁnite dimensional normed
linear spaces. If x = {xn}n∈N is a sequence of real numbers and r is a nonnegative real
number, then x is said to be rough convergent to ξ ∈ R if for every ε > 0 there exists
N ∈ N such that

|xn − ξ| < r + ε for all n ≥ N .

A lot of work has been done in this area by Phu [12],[13], Aytar [1], Pal, Chandra

and Dutta [10] , Malik and Maity [8], [9].

Recently the idea of pointwise statistical convergence of a sequence of real valued
functions is introduced by G¨okhan and G¨ung¨or [6]. Some works in this line can be found

in [2], [7]. So it is quite natural to think about whether the notion of rough convergence
can be introduced for the pointwise statistical convergence of real valued functions.
In this paper we do the same and introduce the notion of pointwise rough statistical
convergence of sequence of real valued functions and study some basic properties of this
type of convergence.

2. Rough Statistical Convergent Sequence of Real Valued Functions

Deﬁnition 2.1. A sequence of real valued functions {fk}k∈N on a set X is said to be
pointwise rough statistically convergent to a function f on a set A if for every ε > 0
there exists a real number r > 0 such that

lim
n→∞

1
n

|{k ≤ n : |fk(x) − f (x)| ≥ r + ε}| = 0

for every x ∈ X.
That is

for every x ∈ X

|fk(x) − f (x)| < r + ε a.a.k.

(1)

In this case we write r-st- lim fk(x) = f (x) on A. This means that for every δ > 0
n |{k ≤ n : |fk(x) − f (x)| ≥ r + ε}| < δ for every

there exists an integer N such that 1
x ∈ A and for all n > N (= N (ε, δ, x)) and for every ε > 0.

Now we deﬁne a sequence of real valued functions which is not pointwise statistically

convergent but pointwise rough statistically convergent.

Example 2.1. Deﬁne a sequence of real valued functions {fi}i∈N by

fi(x) =

1

1 + xi if i 6= k2, k = 1, 2, 3, · · ·

= i, otherwise

on [0, 1].

The sequence {fi}i∈N is pointwise rough statistically convergent to zero with rough-

ness degree 1. But this sequence is not pointwise statistically convergent.

Theorem 2.1. Let {fk}k∈N and {gk}k∈N be two sequences of real valued functions
deﬁned on a set X. If r-st- lim fk(x) = f (x) and r-st- lim gk(x) = g(x) on X, then
r-st- lim(αfk(x) + βgk(x)) = αfk(x) + βgk(x) for all α, β ∈ R.

Proof. The proof is immediate for α = 0 and β = 0. Let α 6= 0 and β 6= 0. Let r > 0
be a real number. Let ε > 0 be given. Then

{k ≤ n : |αfk(x) + βgk(x) − (αf (x) + βg(x))| ≥ r + ε, for any x ∈ X}

⊆ {k ≤ n : |αfk(x) − αf (x)| ≥ r + ε, for any x ∈ X} [

{k ≤ n : |βgk(x) − βg(x))| ≥ r + ε, for any x ∈ X}.

A NOTE ON ROUGH STATISTICAL CONVERGENCE

Since |αfk(x) + βgk(x) − αf (x) + βg(x))| ≥ |αfk(x) − (αf (x)| + |βgk(x) − βg(x)|,
(cid:3)

hence we obtain r-st- lim(αfk(x) + βgk(x)) = αf (x) + βg(x) on X.

Now we introduce the rough statistical analog of the Cauchy convergence criterion.

Deﬁnition 2.2. Let {fk}k∈N be a sequence of real valued functions deﬁned on a set
X. Let r > 0 be a real number. The sequence {fk}k∈N is said to be rough statistically
Cauchy sequence if for every ε > 0 there exists a natural number N (= N (ε, x)) such
n |{k ≤ n : |fk(x) − fN (x)| ≥ r + ε| = 0
that |fk(x) − fN (x)| < r + ε a.a.k. that is lim
n→∞
for every x ∈ X.

Theorem 2.2. Let {fk}k∈N be a sequence of real valued function deﬁned on a set X.
Then the following statements are equivalent.
(i) {fk}k∈N is a pointwise rough statistically convergent sequence on X.
(ii) {fk}k∈N is a rough statistically Cauchy sequence on X.
(iii) {fk}k∈N is a sequence of real valued functions on X for which there exists a point
wise rough statistically convergent sequence of real valued functions {gk}k∈N such that
fk(x) = gk(x) a.a.k. for every x ∈ X.

Proof. (i) implies (ii)

Let r > 0 be a real number. Let r-st- lim fk(x) = f (x). Then for every ε > 0
for every x ∈ X a.a.k. Let N be a natural number so cho-
for every x ∈ X. Then we have |fk(x) − fN (x)| ≤
for every x ∈ X. Hence

|fk(x) − f (x)| < r+ε
sen that |fN (x) − f (x)| < r+ε
|fk(x) − f (x)| + |fN (x) − f (x)| < r+ε
{fk}k∈N is a rough statistically Cauchy sequence.

2 = r + ε a.a.k.

(ii) implies (iii)

Assume that (ii) is true. Choose a natural number N such that the band [fN (x) −

Therefore I1 is a closed band of height less than or equal to 1 which contains fk(x)
a.a.k. for every x ∈ X.
Proceeding in the same manner we can get N2 such that I
contains fk(x) a.a.k. and by above argument I ∩ I
x ∈ X and the height of I2 is less than or equal to 1

M. MAITY

costruct a sequence {Im}m∈N of closed band such that for each m, Im ⊇ Im+1 and the
height of Im is not greater than 21−m and fk(x) ∈ Im a.a.k. for every x ∈ X. Thus

there exists a function f (x) deﬁned on X such that {f (x)} is equal to

Im. Using

∞
T

m=1

the fact that fk(x) ∈ Im a.a.k. for every x ∈ X, we can choose an increasing positive
integer sequence {Jm}m∈N such that

1
n

|{k ≤ n : fk(x) /∈ Im for every x ∈ X}| <

1
m

if n > Jm

(2)

Now construct a subsequence {hk(x)} of {fk(x)} containing of all terms fk(x) such that
k > J1 and when Jm < k ≤ Jm+1 then fk(x) /∈ Im for every x ∈ X.

Deﬁne a sequence of real valued function {gk(x)} by

gk(x) = f (x), if fk(x) is a term of {hk(x)}

for every x ∈ X. Then lim
k→∞

m > 0 and k > Jm, then either

= fk(x), otherwise
gk(x) = f (x) on X. If ε > 1

fk(x) is a term of {hk(x)}, which means

gk(x) = f (x) on X

or gk(x) = fk(x) ∈ Im on X.
and |gk(x) − f (x)| ≤ height of Im ≤ 21−m for every x ∈ X.

Now if Jm < n < Jm+1, then

{k ≤ n : gk(x) 6= fk(x) for every x ∈ X} ⊆ {k ≤ n : fk(x) /∈ Im for every x ∈ X}

so by (10)

1
n

|{k ≤ n : gk(x) 6= fk(x) for every x ∈ X}| ≤

<

|{k ≤ n : fk(x) /∈ Im for every x ∈ X}|

1
n
1
m

.

By taking limit n → ∞ we get the limit is 0 and consequently we say that fk(x) = gk(x)
a.a.k. for every x ∈ X. Therefore (ii) implies (iii).

(iii) implies (i)

Let us assume that (iii) holds. That is fk(x) = gk(x) a.a.k.

for every x ∈ X and
gk(x) = f (x) on X. Let r > 0 be real number and ε > 0. Then for every n, {k ≤

lim
k→∞
n : |fk(x) − f (x)| ≥ r + ε for every x ∈ X} ⊆ {k ≤ n : fk(x) 6= gk(x) for every x ∈
X} S{k ≤ n : |gk(x) − f (x)| ≥ r + ε for every x ∈ X}; since lim
gk(x) = f (x) on X,
k→∞
the later set contains a ﬁnite number of integers, say p = p(ε, x).
Therefore since fk(x) = gk(x) a.a.k for every x ∈ X we get

n |{k ≤ n : fk(x) 6= gk(x)|

for every x ∈ X}| + lim
n→∞

Hence |fk(x) − f (x)| < r + ε a.a.k for every x ∈ X, so (i) holds.
