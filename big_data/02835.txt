Abstract

The C-H vibrational bands become more and more important in the structural

determination of biological molecules with the development of CARS microscopy and

2DIR spectroscopy. Due to the congested pattern, near degeneracy, and strong anhar-

monicity of the C-H stretch vibrations, assignment of the C-H vibrational bands are

often misleading. Anharmonic vibrational spectra calculation with multidimensional

potential energy surface interprets the C-H vibrational spectra more accurately. In this

article we have presented the importance of multidimensional potential energy surface

in anharmonic vibrational spectra calculation and discuss the unexpected red shift of

C-H vibrational band of Methyl benzoate.

Vibrational spectroscopy is a valuable experimental tool to understand the structure and

dynamics of molecules. 1 Vibrational spectra of biological molecules are often congested and

diﬃcult to assign. 2 In practice, vibrational spectral analysis of biomolecules are dominated

by vibrational bands, which can be described approximately in terms of oscillators localized

in each respective unit and their mutual coupling. The most extensively studied bands are

amide-I and amide-II in the range of 1500 to 1700 cm−1, and amide-A and amide-B between

3000 to 3500 cm−1, for the vibrational spectral analysis of biomolecules. 3 Recently developed

coherent anti Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy uses the inherent molecular vi-

bration as a probe to image the biological systems, open up a new direction to understand

the biological activities even in live cell. 4 The C-H vibrational bands draw the most interest

of CARS microscopist to identify fatty acids in cellular environment. 5,6 Not only microscopy,

development of two dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy, 7 gives an enormous opportu-

nity to disentangle the congested vibrational bands and allows to study the C-H vibrational

bands and their coupling in detail. 8 As a results, C-H vibrational bands become an important

probe for structural determination of the biological molecules. However, both the experimen-

tal methodologies are complicated and require more reﬁned theoretical and computational

model to understand the C-H vibrational spectra.

The C-H stretching modes are highly localized and in general it is considered as nearly

pure hydrogen motion, essentially insensitive to the molecular conformation and environ-

ment. 9 In reality C-H vibrational modes not only interact with themselves but also to the

other vibrational bands in the molecule, as a results a strong anharmonic eﬀect is observed.

Due to the anharmonic eﬀect, the C-H vibrational spectra calculation within the harmonic

approximation is not suﬃcient.

Several attempts have been taken to assign the anharmonic C-H vibrational bands. How-

ever, due to the congested vibrational pattern and near degeneracy of the vibrational bands,

calculation of the C-H vibrational bands are often troublesome. 10,11 The main diﬃculties

of the anharmonic spectra calculation is that diﬀerent vibrational bands are not mutually

separable. Therefore one has to face the task of calculating wavefunctions and energy levels

for systems of many couple degrees of freedom which increases very fast with the system size.

To overcome this problem, several attempts have been made, e.g., diﬀusion quantum Monte

Carlo (DQMC), 12 vibrational conﬁguration interaction (CI),13 vibrational self-consistent

ﬁeld (VSCF), 14 etc. methods. Among them the VSCF method is the most successful to

eﬀectively handle reasonably large molecular systems.

The success of the VSCF method depends upon the accuracy of the calculated potential

energy surface (PES). 15,16 In the VSCF approach, the PES enters into the calculation in

the form of multidimensional integrals for the eﬀective one-dimensional potentials which is

the most diﬃcult part of the VSCF calculations. To simplify these integrals it is possible to

3

express the PES in terms of a hierarchical many-body expansion. 17

is the triple coupling and so on.

In typical molecular problems quadruple and higher in-

teraction potentials have a negligible inﬂuence on the vibrational spectrum, therefore they

are commonly neglected in the VSCF calculations. In a recent detailed analysis it has been

shown that even only few triple couplings have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence. 18 For typically large

molecular systems diagonal and pair potentials are usually suﬃcient if the PESs are calcu-

lated accurately in an appropriately chosen coordinate system. 19,20 Additionally diagonal

potentials may be calculated employing a higher level computational method than the pair

potentials to increase the accuracy of the VSCF calculations signiﬁcantly. Such a dual level

computation not only improves the accuracy but also reduces the computational expenses

signiﬁcantly due to the exclusion of large number of possible pair potential.

To understand the vibrational coupling between the C-H vibrational bands and other

vibrational motions of the molecule, Methyl benzoate has been chosen as a model molecule.

In the potential energy minima, the ester group remains in the same plane as the benzene

ring. As a result, Methyl benzoate is a planar molecule except for the two hydrogen atoms

of the methyl group, which are symmetrically out of plane with respect to the rest of the

molecule (Fig. 1). Due to the very low potential barrier (∼0.25 eV), ester group can easily

rotate around the C-C bond axis. In the present work we have investigated the coupling

between this rotational motion of ester group and the C-H vibrations. To keep the C-H

vibrational region less congested, the β-hydrogen has been replaced by deuterium, which

shifts one of the C-H vibrational band at around 2200 cm−1.

Anharmonic vibrational frequencies of the C-H vibrational band of Methyl benzoate has

been plotted along with harmonic frequencies and FTIR spectra in Fig. 2. In general the C-H

vibrational bands are localized in the region of 2800 - 3100 cm−1 for biological molecules. 21

Calculated harmonic frequencies are localized at 3050 - 3250 cm−1, which are quite higher

than the experimental frequencies of the C-H vibrations. 22 Diagonal anharmonic frequencies,

calculated from the anharmonic diagonal PES, are also very high compare to the experimen-

tal C-H vibrational frequencies (Table 1). However, the anharmonic vibrational frequencies

calculated with the pair coupling potentials are in very good agreement with the experi-

of the anharmonic C-H vibrational frequency calculated from the pair coupling potential is

unexpectedly red shifted about 400 cm−1. Surprisingly, a small spectral feature has been

observed at the experimental spectra, approximately at the same place of the shifted C-H

anharmonic frequency. In practice such a small spectral feature does not create any attention

and overlooked as an artifact or noise. However, when diﬀerent level of anharmonic frequency

calculations from pair coupling potentials yield the same results, it draws a special interest

for further investigation.

C-H band, phenyl C-H = phenyl ring C-H band.

To verify the existence of this small spectral feature we have calculated the anharmonic

vibrational frequencies with diﬀerent level of quantum chemistry methods and employing

diﬀerent size of basis sets. A very interesting ﬁnding has been observed. All the anharmonic

frequency calculations with the pair coupling potentials yield the similar frequency shift

(∼ 400 cm−1) for one of the C-H vibrational band. There is no indication of such a large

frequency shift neither with the harmonic nor with the anharmonic frequency calculations

using diagonal potential. The frequency shift is observed only when pair coupling potential

has been used. Therefore there must be one or more vibrational bands which are coupled

with one of the C-H vibrational band. A close inspection indicates that the C-H vibrational

frequency at 2560 cm−1 originates from the asymmetric C-H stretch vibration in the methyl

group. Additionally, it is coupled with the out of plane rotational motion of the ester group

with respect to the phenyl ring around the C-C bond.

Due to the low potential barrier (∼0.25 eV) in normal thermal condition ester group ro-

tates around the C-C bond with respect to the phenyl ring. Such a out of plane rotation is

pulled one of the out of plane hydrogen atom of methyl group to the plane of the molecule

7

and other hydrogen is pushed from the molecular plane. This bi-directional forces (Fig. 1a

and 1b) change the force constant of the anti-symmetric C-H stretch vibration signiﬁcantly,

as a result an unexpected red shift is observed. Therefore it is necessary to account the

rotational motion of the ester group for accurate description of the anti-symmetric C-H vi-

brational band. Since the harmonic and diagonal anharmonic calculations do not account

the coupling, it fails to calculate the anti-symmetric vibrational band accurately. The pair

coupling potential considers the rotation of ester group and anti-symmetric motion of the

methyl C-H vibration together, resulting the more accurate C-H stretch vibration.

In this article we have presented the importance of the multi dimensional potential en-

ergy surface in anharmonic vibrational spectra calculation. The C-H vibrational bands have

been calculated with the harmonic as well as anharmonic approximation. The calculated

harmonic and anharmonic diagonal frequencies are signiﬁcantly higher than the experimen-

tal result. The anharmonic C-H vibrational frequencies calculated from the pair coupling

potential have very good agreement with the experimental result. This ﬁndings indicate that

one dimensional potential is not suﬃcient for the anharmonic vibrational frequency calcula-

tion, at least pair coupling potential is necessary for better description of the anharmonic

vibrational spectra.

Computational methods: All computations have been performed using the MOLPRO

quantum chemistry program. 23 Second order Møller-Plesset (MP2) perturbation theory24

has been used for the geometry optimization employing augmented correlation-consistence

polarized-valence-triple zeta (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis set. Harmonic normal-mode analysis has

been performed with the density ﬁtting MP2 (DF-MP2) method using aug-cc-pVTZ regular

basis and cc-pVTZ ﬁtting basis set. Diagonal potentials have been calculated with MP2

method using aug-cc-pVTZ basis set. The anharmonic pair coupling potentials are calcu-

lated with DF-MP2 method and employing the same cc-pVDZ basis set for regular as well
