The Selberg integral and a new pair-correlation function

for the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function

Abstract. The present paper is a report on joint work with Alessan-
dro Languasco and Alberto Perelli, collected in [10], [11] and [12], on
our recent investigations on the Selberg integral and its connections to
Montgomery’s pair-correlation function. We introduce a more general
form of the Selberg integral and connect it to a new pair-correlation
function, emphasising its relations to the distribution of prime numbers
in short intervals.

Keywords. Riemann zeta-function, Selberg integral, Montgomery’s
pair-correlation function.

1 - Introduction

The central problem of Analytic Number Theory is the distribution of prime
numbers. How many prime numbers are there, and are they “randomly” or
“evenly” distributed? The answers to these questions are known only partially,
even if one assumes powerful and, as yet, unproved hypotheses like Riemann’s.
Here we are interested in the distribution of prime numbers in “short intervals,”
from various points of view. We give a strong quantitative version of previous
results on the connection between the Selberg integral J deﬁned in (5) and

This research was partially supported by the grant PRIN2010-11 Arithmetic Algebraic

Geometry and Number Theory.

Montgomery’s pair-correlation function F deﬁned in (9). Then we introduce
a new, generalised pair-correlation function and show that it essentially is in
charge of the distribution of primes in short intervals, giving a uniﬁed view of
many problems.

While it is always advisable to read the original papers (like Montgomery’s
[15] and the other ones quoted at appropriate places), it is extremely instructive
to start with Goldston’s excellent survey [4].

2 - Distribution of prime numbers: Large scale

2.1 - The Chebyshev prime-counting functions

Let

π(x) def= |{p ≤ x : p is prime}|

and

ψ(x) def= Xn≤x

Λ(n),

where Λ(n) = 0 unless n = pα for some prime p and positive integer α; and

Λ(cid:0)pα(cid:1) = log p. We also let

li(x)

def

= Z x

2

dt
log t

.

It has been conjectured by Gauss at the end of the XVIII century that π(x) ∼
li(x) as x → +∞. Stated in this way, Gauss’s conjecture is equivalent to Leg-
endre’s simpler statement that π(x) ∼ x/ log x, but Gauss’s approximation is
numerically far closer to the truth. The truth of the asymptotic statement above
was proved independently by Hadamard and de la Vall´ee Poussin in 1896 and
is called the Prime Number Theorem (PNT, for short). Let

∆π(x) def= π(x) − li(x)

and

∆ψ(x) def= ψ(x) − x.

According to the strongest form of the PNT known today, there is a constant
c > 0 such that for x → +∞

(1)

∆π(x), ∆ψ(x) ≪ R(x) def= x expn−c(log x)3/5(log log x)−1/5o .

The PNT shows that to a ﬁrst approximation π(x) is very close to li(x) and
ψ(x) is very close to x. Of course, it is interesting, and in some applications
critical, to know the exact degree of these approximations. It has been known
since Riemann’s pioneering paper [21] that ∆π and ∆ψ both depend on the dis-
tribution of the zeros of the zeta-function. The connection has received a strong
quantitative form by Pintz [20], building on earlier work started by Ingham.
Here we are mainly concerned with the case of “optimal distribution,” and we
will not pursue this connection further.

2.2 - The Riemann Hypothesis

In his 1859 paper referred to above, Riemann proved that the zeta-function

deﬁned by the Dirichlet series

ζ(s) =Xn≥1

1
ns

for σ = ℜ(s) > 1,

has a meromorphic continuation to the complex plane, except for the point s = 1
where ζ has a simple pole with residue 1. The continuation has inﬁnitely many
real zeros (the so-called “trivial zeros”) at the points −2, −4, −6, . . . , and also
inﬁnitely many non-real zeros in the strip σ ∈ [0, 1]. It is customary to denote
the generic non-trivial zero of the Riemann ζ-function by ρ := β + iγ. These
zeros are placed symmetrically with respect to the real axis and the line σ = 1
2 .
Riemann wrote that it looks “likely” that all of these zeros actually lie on the
line σ = 1
2 , but that he was unable to prove it. This is the original statement
of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH, for short) that is still unsettled, as yet.
The Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to either of the two statements

(2)

π(x) =Z x

2

dt
log t

+ O(cid:16)x1/2 log x(cid:17) or ψ(x) = x + O(cid:16)x1/2(log x)2(cid:17) .

Of course, this is much stronger than (1). Notice that by Littlewood’s Theorem
[13] of 1914, we have

(3)

∆ψ(x) = ψ(x) − x = Ω±(cid:0)x1/2 log log log x(cid:1).

Here, the notation means that ∆ψ(x) is larger than a positive multiple of
x1/2 log log log x for a suitable unbounded sequence of values of x, and smaller
than a negative multiple of the same function on another such sequence.
In
other words, the RH is very nearly optimal. It seems plausible that the correct
maximal order of magnitude for ψ(x) − x be x1/2(log log log x)2. See §15.3 of
Montgomery & Vaughan [18].

3 - Distribution of prime numbers: Small scale

3.1 - Primes in all “short” intervals

The “additive” form of the expected main term for both π and ψ readily
suggests a conjecture on the number of prime numbers contained in the interval
(x, x + y]. We say that such an interval is short if y = o(x).

Question 1. For y ≤ x, is it true that

(4)

π(x + y) − π(x) ∼Z x+y

x

dt
log t

or ψ(x + y) − ψ(x) ∼ y

?

3

The asymptotic relations in (4) are true if y/R(x) → +∞. This is essentially
trivial, because we can use (1) twice and the diﬀerence between the leading terms
is larger than the error terms.

We may rephrase the question as: Is (4) true also for smaller y? For very
small y (say, y ≍ log x or smaller) it is trivially false, because most intervals will
not be long enough to contain any primes at all. On the other hand, if y = 1
and x + 1 is a prime number, then the interval (x, x + 1] contains “too many”
primes. We assume that y → +∞ with x in order to avoid such trivialities.

The asymptotic formulae (4) are false also for y = (log x)α, for any ﬁxed
α > 1: this has been proved by Maier in 1985 [14], and it came as a sur-
prise since, as we know conditionally from Selberg’s work [23], they are usu-
ally true; see the discussion below. Unconditionally, the relations (4) are
true for y ≥ x7/12−ε(x), provided that ε(x) → 0+ as x → +∞; see Heath-
Brown [9]. Of course, on the RH they are true in a wider range: by (2), for

y/(cid:0)x1/2(log x)2(cid:1) → +∞, but we must recall that Cram´er proved that the weaker
condition y/(cid:0)x1/2(log x)(cid:1) → +∞ suﬃces. Actually, his techniques also prove

that the RH implies the existence of at least x1/2 prime numbers in the interval
[x, x + y] provided that y ≥ Cx1/2 log x, where C is a suﬃciently large constant.
See Theorem 13.3 in [18].

A long-standing open problem is to bridge the gap between Maier-type re-
sults and what is known under the RH. It is plausible that we can take y = xε for
any ﬁxed ε > 0, or even slightly smaller. As we remarked above, by Littlewood’s
Theorem (3) we know that the error term ∆ψ(x) = ψ(x) − x is sometimes quite
large, but it is conceivable that it varies very slowly and then one can compute
accurately ψ(x + y) − ψ(x) for comparatively small y, although indirectly.

These topics are discussed at great length and in full detail in Chapters 13

and 15 of Montgomery & Vaughan [18]. See, in particular, §13.1.

3.2 - Primes in “almost all” short intervals: The Selberg integral

In some applications, it is not necessary to know that either of (4) holds for
every y, but only that it holds for most values of y. Selberg introduced a very
convenient way of measuring precisely what “usually” means. Let

(5)

J(x, θ) def= Z 2x

x

|ψ(t + θt) − ψ(t) − θt|2 dt

denote the “variance” of the primes in short intervals, where, in the notation of
the previous sections, θ ∈ [0, 1] is essentially y/x.

Question 2. In which range of values for θ is it true that

(6)

If θ is not too small the Brun-Titchmarsh inequality in Theorem A.1 implies
that J(x, θ) ≪ x3θ2. Furthermore, we know that (6) holds unconditionally in

J(x, θ) = o(cid:0)x3θ2(cid:1) ?

4

the range x−5/6−ε(x) ≤ θ ≤ 1, provided that ε(x) → 0 as x → ∞; see [24]. A
lower bound for θ is needed, since for θ = 1/x, say, J(x, θ) essentially reduces
to

(7)

(Λ(n) − 1)2 ∼ x log x,

Xn∈[x,2x]

by the Prime Number Theorem, and hence (6) is false in this range. Actually,
the Brun-Titchmarsh inequality in Theorem A.1 implies, more generally, that
J(x, θ) ≪ x3θ2(log x)2(log(2θx))−2 for θ ≥ x−1, which is compatible with (7).
Notice, however, that the mentioned inequality sometimes “loses” a log-factor.
If we assume the RH we have a much stronger result, which is due to Selberg

in [23]:

(8)

J(x, θ) ≪ x2θ(cid:0)log(2/θ)(cid:1)2

In other words, in this range of values for θ,

uniformly for x−1 ≤ θ ≤ 1.

ψ(t + θt) − ψ(t) = θt + O (r(x, θ))

for “almost all” t ∈ [x, 2x],

provided that r(x, θ)/(cid:0)(θx)1/2 log x(cid:1) → +∞. More precisely, the cardinality of

the set of integers t ∈ [x, 2x] such that the asymptotic formula above fails to
hold is o(x) as x → +∞. When θ = x−1(log x)α we still have that the expected
asymptotic formula holds for most integers: Maier’s result implies that, in fact,
there are inﬁnitely many exceptions, although they are rather sparse.

Notice that for θ = 1/x this strong result is essentially empty! Notice also
what happens for θ = 1: the average bound is slightly stronger than the point-
wise one given in (2).

The proof of Selberg’s results begins observing that, without any hypothesis,

we have

x1+2β1 min(θ2, γ−2
1 )

(1 + |γ1 − γ2|)2 .

J(x, θ) ≪Xρ1 Xρ2
J(x, θ) ≪ x2Xγ>0

If the RH holds, then ρ = 1
therefore

2 + iγ for all zeros of the Riemann zeta-function, and

min(θ2, γ−2) log(γ),

by the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula A.3. Considering separately the ranges
γ ∈ (0, θ−1) and γ > θ−1, we see that the Riemann Hypothesis implies (8). As-
suming a less restrictive hypothesis on the distribution of the zeros, one obtains
the result described in the next section.

3.3 - Strong bounds for J and the quasi-RH

Recall that ρ := β + iγ denotes the generic non-trivial zero of the Riemann

ζ-function and let

Θ def= sup {β ≤ 1 : ζ(β + iγ) = 0} .

5

Essentially, Θ < 1 implies that J(x, θ) ≪ x(θx)2Θ+ε for any ε > 0, uniformly
for xε−1 ≤ θ ≤ 1. On the RH we have Θ = 1
2 and we have the stronger bound
given in (8); see e. g., Saﬀari & Vaughan [22], Lemma 6. We remark that we do
not even know whether Θ < 1 or not, as yet.

It is interesting that it is also possible to invert the arrow, as in Pintz’s
results quoted above. We can deduce information concerning the horizontal
distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function from hypothetical strong
upper bounds for J.

Remark. Assume that J(x, 1) ≪ xδ for some δ ∈ [2, 3]. Then Θ ≤ 1

2 (δ − 1)

Notice that no uniformity is needed. This is a result in the author’s paper

[25]. The proof is little more than Cauchy’s inequality.

3.4 - Application to an approximation problem

The results described in the previous section are obviously interesting in
themselves. Here we quickly quote an application to an approximation problem
which is relevant for the circle method. We have two exponential sums, one
containing explicitly the prime numbers, and we know that they are close to
each other in the neighbourhood of 0. The Selberg integral gives, essentially,
the L2-norm of the diﬀerence. Let

S(α) def= Xn≤x

Λ(n)e2πinα

and

T (α) def= Xn≤x

e2πinα.

It is well known that T gives a good approximation to S for α small since,
in fact, S(0) = ψ(x) and T (0) = ⌊x⌋.
In Diophantine problems like the one
described by Br¨udern, Cook & Perelli in [1], the circle is replaced by the whole
real line which is dissected into three pieces: the main term arises as an integral
over a neighbourhood of 0 and the width of the neighbourhood is reﬂected in
the quality of the ﬁnal result. According to Lemma 1 in [1] we have

Z 1/(θx)

−1/(θx)

|S(α) − T (α)|2 dα ≪

1

(θx)2(cid:0)J(x, θ) + x(cid:1) + θx(log x)2.

Here we see the important role of uniformity in θ: the length of the integra-
tion interval depends on it. Ideally, we would like to have θ = 1/(2x) so that
there is no “minor arc,” which, by deﬁnition, is the set of α’s where we have
comparatively poor information on the exponential sum S.

4 - Montgomery’s pair-correlation function

We now assume RH until the end. Following Montgomery, we let

(9)

F (x, T ) def= Xγ1,γ2∈[0,T ]

4xi(γ1−γ2)

4 + (γ1 − γ2)2 = Xγ1,γ2∈[0,T ]

xi(γ1−γ2)ω(γ1 − γ2),

6

where ω(x) = 4/(4+x2). The weight ω arises naturally as the Fourier transform
of e−2|x|, apart from a normalisation factor. Montgomery [15] proved that

F (x, T ) ∼

T
2π

log x

as T → +∞

uniformly for T ε ≤ x ≤ T , and gave the following conjecture.

Conjecture 1 (Montgomery). For T → +∞ we have

F (x, T ) ∼

T
2π

log T

uniformly for T ≤ x ≤ T A.

In other words, only the “diagonal” terms where γ1 = γ2 give a contribution,
in view of the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula in Theorem A.3 below, whereas
the other terms, more or less, cancel out.

4.1 - The link between F and J

A number of authors studied the connection between hypothetical asymp-
totic formulae for J and F , with increasing precision. The following table lists
the major contributions.

• Goldston & Montgomery (1987) [6]

• Montgomery & Soundararajan (2002) [16]

• Chan (2003) [2]

• Languasco, Perelli & Z. (2012) [10].

Apart from a possible lack of precision, the argument leading to (8) sketched
at the end of §3.2 shows that J depends crucially on the distribution of zeros of
ζ: Injecting the information contained in Montgomery’s Conjecture 1, one gets
the one-term asymptotic formula

(10)

J(x, θ) ∼

3
2

x2θ log(1/θ),

and conversely, superseding (8). More precisely, if the asymptotic relation in

Conjecture 1 holds uniformly for T ∈ (cid:2)xB1 L−3, xB2 L3(cid:3) then (10) holds uni-
formly for θ ∈(cid:2)x−B2 , x−B1(cid:3), where L = log x and 0 < B1 ≤ B2 ≤ 1 are ﬁxed.

A similar assumption on the range for (10) allows to recover Conjecture 1 in
the corresponding range. This is Theorem 2 of Goldston & Montgomery [6].
From now on, we drop all reference to uniformity ranges, for simplicity. More
generally, the authors mentioned above set out to pursue the following

Goal. Compare the size of the “error terms” RJ and RF in expansions like

J(x, θ) = c1x2θ log(1/θ) + c2x2θ + RJ (x, θ)
F (x, T ) = c3T log T + c4T + RF (x, T )

in suitable ranges of uniformity.

7

In both cases the main parameter is x. The expected values of the constants
cj are known. We may therefore restate our goal in a more precise form. Let
RJ and RF be deﬁned implicitly by

J(x, θ) =

3
2

and

x2θ(cid:0)log(1/θ) + 1 − γ − log(2π)(cid:1) + RJ (x, θ)

F (x, T ) =

T

2π(cid:16)log

T
2π

− 1(cid:17) + RF (x, T ).

We expect that RJ is small if and only if RF is, provided that the assumed bound
holds in a wide enough range of values. In fact, assuming RH Montgomery &

imaginary parts of the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function are “well distributed”
in the sense that RF (x, T ) = o(T ). In other words, the diagonal contribution
γ1 = γ2 dominates, as expected. Actually, it seems necessary to assume slightly

Soundararajan proved that, essentially, RJ (x, θ) = o(cid:0)x2θ(cid:1) if and only if the
more than just RF (x, T ) = o(T ) in order to get RJ (x, θ) = o(cid:0)x2θ(cid:1): see the

detailed comment to equation (1.8) in [10]. We stress again the importance of
the uniformity ranges in the hypothesis.

Following Chan’s results in [2], Languasco, Perelli and the author studied

relations between hypothetical bounds of the type

RJ (x, θ) = O(cid:0)x2θ1+α(cid:1)

and

RF (x, T ) = O(cid:0)T 1−β(cid:1).

We state a weakened and simpliﬁed form of our results: for full details see [10].
Essentially, for α, β > 0, we have

(11)

(12)

RJ (x, θ) ≪ x2θ1+α
RF (x, T ) ≪ T 1−β

=⇒

=⇒

RF (x, T ) ≪ T 1−α/(α+3)
RJ (x, θ) ≪ x2θ1+β/2.

Here we are totally neglecting log-powers and uniformity in the various param-
eters, for simplicity of statement, since our results are as general as they are
cumbersome. According to the heuristics given by Montgomery & Soundarara-
jan in [16], a plausible range for α and β is the interval (0, 1

For the proof we need various forms of abelian-tauberian results, extending
the technique introduced by Goldston & Montgomery in [6]. Essentially, we have
a hypothetical average of a certain function, say J, and we need to transform
it into a diﬀerent average of the same function, before we can use standard
Fourier-transform techniques. This leads to some loss of uniformity. This also
shows why we use J instead of the perhaps more “natural”

2 ).

eJ(x, y) def= Z 2x

x

|ψ(t + y) − ψ(t) − y|2 dt,

because J is more directly connected to sums over zeros, via the explicit formula
for ψ. In fact, using J we see that each summand in the ﬁnite sum over zeros
factors as tρc(ρ, θ) as in (13) below, and this leads to simpler handling.

However, there is a standard way to relate J(x, θ) and eJ(x, θx) and the two

asymptotic formulae diﬀer only in the “secondary main term,” that is, in the
value of the constant c2 above. For full details, see Saﬀari & Vaughan [22].

We select a few, signiﬁcant, steps of the proof. The ﬁrst one is the approxi-

mate equality

F (x, T ) =

1 + (t − γ)2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dt + O(cid:0)(log T )3(cid:1) .

Let c(ρ, θ) :=(cid:0)(1 + θ)ρ − 1(cid:1)/ρ. The ﬁrst application of a tauberian result yields

the asymptotic formula for

where the interval [0, T ] has been replaced by the whole real line, only the
zeros with “small” imaginary parts are included and there is the coeﬃcient of
the “right” shape, namely c. Another application coupled with the Plancherel
formula gives the asymptotic formula for

where Z is at our disposal. This is essentially J, since

by the Explicit formula A.2, where T is a free parameter. Recalling that β < 1
for every zero of the Riemann ζ-function, we have

c(ρ, θ) =Z 1+θ

1

tρ−1 dt ≪ min(cid:16)θ,

|γ|(cid:17).

This means that we have to choose, essentially, T = θ−1 and a suitable value for
Z. Among other things, here we improve a crucial technical lemma (Lemma 1
of [10]) that allows us to reach the square root in (12) instead of the fourth root
as in Chan [2].

4.2 - A diﬀerent version of Montgomery’s pair-correlation conjecture

A slightly weaker form of Montgomery’s Conjecture 1 describes the distribu-
tion of the “gaps” between zeros of the Riemann zeta-function. For the detailed
relationship between the two Conjectures, see [4], Theorem 4.

9

Conjecture 2 (Montgomery). For ﬁxed α and β with 0 < α < β we have

2π

as T → +∞.

T log TZ β

α (cid:16)1 −(cid:16) sin(πu)

πu (cid:17)2(cid:17) du,

The function inside the integral on the far right is known as the pair-
correlation function for the zeros of the Riemann ζ-function.
In view of the
Riemann-von Mangoldt formula A.3, the average spacing between consecutive
zeros of the Riemann zeta-function with imaginary parts in [0, T ] is 2π/ log T .

5 - A general pair-correlation function

5.1 - A unifying approach

Let τ ∈ [0, 1] and deﬁne

F (x, T, τ ) def= Xγ1,γ2∈[−T,T ]

4xi(γ1−γ2)

4 + τ 2(γ1 − γ2)2 .

It is clear that F (x, T, 1) is (essentially) the same as F (x, T ). This function is
already present, albeit in a slightly diﬀerent guise, in Heath-Brown & Goldston
[5]; they do not directly pursue its relations with primes in short intervals, but
use it simply as a technical device.

Moreover, F (x1/τ , T, τ ) is the pair-correlation function for Zτ (s) = ζ(s/τ ),
where Zτ is (almost) an element of the Selberg Class of degree and conductor

d =

1
τ

and

q =(cid:16) 1

τ(cid:17)1/τ

respectively. This means that we can use well-known heuristics for the Selberg
class to make plausible guesses concerning F (x, T, τ ). Of course, Zτ is an el-
ement of the Selberg Class only for τ = 1. See Murty & Perelli [19] for the
discussion of the pair-correlation function in the Selberg Class.

5.2 - Properties of the general pair-correlation function

Notice that F (x, T, 0) = |Σ(x, T )|2 where

(14)

Σ(x, T ) def= X|γ|≤T

xiγ

is the exponential sum that appears in Landau’s explicit formula A.4. There is a
strong conjecture of Gonek [7] concerning the behaviour of Σ: see Conjecture 3.

10

We remark that F (x, T, τ ) is diﬃcult to estimate for τ very small (≤ 1/T ); in
fact the trivial bound

F (x, T, τ ) ≪ min(cid:0)T, τ −1(cid:1)T log2 T

becomes very large. When τ = 1, the trivial bound for F (x, T ) is only slightly
larger than the expected truth, by just a log factor.

5.3 - The generalised Selberg Integral

From now on we assume that τ > 0 in order to avoid trivial statements. Let

J(x, τ, θ)

def

= Z x(1+τ )

x

|ψ(t + θt) − ψ(t) − θt|2 dt.

Here we are dealing with “short intervals” in two diﬀerent ways. The obvious
conjecture is J(x, τ, θ) ≪ x2+ετ θ.

Assumption (Hypothesis H(η)). We assume that the RH holds and that

F (x, T, τ ) ≪ T xε

uniformly for

(xη ≤ T ≤ x

xη/T ≤ τ ≤ 1

for some ﬁxed η > 0 and every ε > 0.

This assumption is “justiﬁed” by Gonek’s Conjecture 3 for τ small, and
by an obvious generalisation of Montgomery’s for τ large. In [11], Languasco,
Perelli and the author give a variant of H(η) valid for η = 0, which we omit for
brevity. The following results are Theorem 1 and 2, respectively, of [11].

T h e o r e m 5.1. If assumption H(η) holds for some η ∈ (0, 1), then

J(x, τ, θ) ≪ x2+ετ θ

uniformly for x−1 ≤ θ ≤ x−η and θxη ≤ τ ≤ 1.

As an immediate corollary, we have that

for “almost all” x ∈ [x, x(1 + τ )] and y ∈ [1, x1−η].

ψ(x + y) − ψ(x) = y + O(cid:0)y1/2xε(cid:1)

T h e o r e m 5.2. Let ε > 0 be small. If assumption H(η) holds for some

η ∈ (0, 1/2 − 5ε), then

ψ(x + y) − ψ(x) = y +(O(cid:0)y2/3xη/3+ε(cid:1)
O(cid:0)y1/3x1/6+η/3+ε(cid:1)

for xη+5ε ≤ y ≤ x1/2,
for x1/2 ≤ y ≤ x1−η.

11

We quote (2.3) of [11] to show the explicit connection between the “short”
Selberg integral and the generalised pair-correlation function that we use in the
proof of Theorem 5.1. In fact we have

Z x+y

The proof of Theorem 5.2 uses the “inertia” property of ψ: ψ(x + y) − ψ(x)
does not change by more than ≍ log x as x increases by 1. Hence, if

ψ(x + y) − ψ(x) − y

is abnormally large in absolute value for some x = x0, it is also large for “many”
values of x around x0, which is impossible by the previous Theorem 5.1. We also
adapt an argument in Gonek [7]. In the proof of Theorem 5.1 we need suitable,
uniform generalisations of the results in the original paper by Heath-Brown [8].

5.4 - More consequences

One of the more interesting corollaries of our work in [11] is the fact that we
obtain explicit estimates for ∆ψ(x) = ψ(x) − x. More precisely, we show that
there is a direct, quantitative connection between the size of ∆ψ and

1. the hypothetical uniformity in τ ,

2. the hypothetical estimate for F (x, T, τ ).

We pick an example: see Theorem 3 and Remark 3 in [11] for a complete
discussion of this important topic. Assume the RH and that F (x, T, τ ) ≪
T log T uniformly for U ≤ T ≤ x1/2. Then, if the choice

is admissible, it yields

τ = min(cid:16)1,

log4 U

log3 x(cid:17),

∆ψ(x) ≪ x1/2 log2 U.

6 - Asymptotic formulae

6.1 - The asymptotic formula for F (x, T, τ )

Let

where

Λ2(n)

n

S(x, τ ) def= Xn≥1
a(n, x, τ ) def= ((n/x)1/τ

(x/n)1/τ

a2(n, x, τ ),

if n ≤ x
if n > x.

12

Notice that S(x, τ ) ≪ τ log x by the Brun-Titchmarsh inequality, if τ is not too
small. In [12], Languasco, Perelli and the author gave the following asymptotic
result.

T h e o r e m 6.1. As x → +∞ we have

F (x, T, τ ) ∼

+

T log2 T
πτ x2/τ + smaller order terms

uniformly for τ ≥ 1/T , provided that T S(x, τ ) = ∞(cid:0)max(x, (log T )3/τ )(cid:1).

Of course, this reduces to Montgomery’s result for τ = 1. We remark that
Theorem 6.1 shows the same phenomenon of yielding an asymptotic formula
only at “extreme ranges.”

We use a σ-uniform version of the main Lemma in Montgomery’s original

paper [15]. He used his crucial representation for the function

(15)

(2σ − 1)Xγ

xiγ

(σ − 1/2)2 + (t − γ)2

2 , while we have to take σ = 1

for σ = 3
2 + τ −1. Since we are interested in very
small values of τ , our estimates have to be uniform with respect to σ, and this
leads to a fair amount of complication in detail. We also have to take care of
other uniformity aspects.

The ﬁrst “main term” for F (x, T, τ ) arises as follows: our version of Mont-
gomery’s representation for (15) is the sum of several terms, the most important
being

R1(x, t, τ ) def= − x−1/2(cid:16)Xn≤x

Λ(n)(cid:16) x

n(cid:17)1−σ+it

+Xn>x

Λ(n)(cid:16) x

n(cid:17)σ+it(cid:17),

where, here and until the end of the section, σ = 1
2 + τ −1. We square out and
integrate over [−T, T ] using Corollary 3 of Montgomery & Vaughan [17] for the
L2-average of Dirichlet series over intervals. Thus, neglecting error terms, we
have

Λ(n)2

n

a(n, x, τ )2 = 2T S(x, T ).

On the other hand, the integral of the square of (15) over the same interval is

Z T
−T(cid:12)(cid:12)R1(x, t, τ )(cid:12)(cid:12)2

dt ∼ 2TXn≥1
∼ 4τ 2Z−R(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) Xγ∈[−T,T ]

2

dt,

xiγ

1 + τ 2(t − γ)2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

by the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula of Theorem A.3. Squaring out, inte-
grating term by term and computing the relevant residue, we conclude that this
is

∼ 2πτ F (x, T, τ ).

13

The residue turns out to be a constant multiple of τ −1ω(τ (γ1 − γ2)).

The second “main term” in Theorem 6.1 arises computing the contribution

of another term in the development of (15), namely

R2(x, t, τ ) def=

1
4

x1/2−σ+it(cid:0)log(σ2 + t2) + log((1 − σ)2 + t2)(cid:1).

Of course, this second main term is negligible unless x is quite small.

6.2 - The asymptotic formula for S(x, τ )

As remarked above, if τ ≥ xε−1 then S(x, τ ) ≪ τ log x. Moreover, if y ≤ x

and

then

ψ(x + y) − ψ(x) ∼ y

uniformly for y ≥ xβ+ε

S(x, τ ) ∼ τ log x

uniformly for τ ≥ xβ+ε−1.

However, S is erratic for τ ≤ 1/x. Essentially, it reduces to the single term
given by the prime power closest to x.
If x itself is a prime number, then
S(x, 1/x) ≍ (log x)2/x, but if the prime power nearest to x is, say, x ± c log x for
some c > 0, then S(x, 1/x) ≍ (log x)2/x1+c, which is much smaller. Of course,
gaps between consecutive primes of size ≫ log x occur inﬁnitely often, by the
PNT.

6.3 - The asymptotic formula for J(x, τ, θ)

Finally, in [12], Languasco, Perelli and the author also gave the following

asymptotic result.

T h e o r e m 6.2. Assume the “Generalised Montgomery Conjecture.” Then

J(x, τ, θ) ∼(cid:16)1 +

τ

2(cid:17)τ θx2 log(1/θ)

uniformly for 1/x ≤ θ ≤ x−ε and θ1/2−ε ≤ τ ≤ 1.

Of course, the ﬁrst factor here is relevant only if τ ≫ 1, when Theorem 6.2
is a consequence of earlier results. We left it for ease of comparison. The proof
requires a suitable, stronger version of the technique introduced by Goldston &
Montgomery in [6], with particular care for the τ -uniformity aspect.

A - The tools

Here we brieﬂy summarise the main tools that we need.

T h e o r e m A.1 (Brun-Titchmarsh inequality). For x > 0 and y ≥ 2 we

have

π(x + y) − π(x) ≤

2y

log y(cid:0)1 + O(cid:0)(log y)−1(cid:1)(cid:1).

14

This is the special case q = 1 of Theorem 3.9 of Montgomery & Vaughan
[18]. The error term may be omitted. The two results that follow are classical:
they are Theorem 12.5 and Corollary 14.3 respectively of [18].

T h e o r e m A.2 (Explicit formula). If x ≥ 2 is not an integer and T ≥ 2,

we have

log(cid:0)1 − x−2(cid:1)
(log xT )2 + (log x) min(cid:16)1,

x

T hxi(cid:17)(cid:19) ,

where hxi denotes the distance from x to the nearest prime power diﬀerent from
x itself. If x is an integer, the term − 1
2 Λ(x) is to be added to the left hand side.
This is a very convenient representation of ∆ψ(x) = ψ(x) − x, since it con-
tains the “free” parameter T (free in the sense that it does not appear in the
left-hand side). This means that its value can be chosen in an optimal way in
diﬀerent applications. The upper bound in (2) is an almost immediate deduc-
tion of the Riemann Hypothesis, using also the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula
below.

T h e o r e m A.3 (Riemann-von Mangoldt formula). Let N (T ) denote the
number of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function lying in the rectangle in the com-
plex plane with sides [0, 1] along the real axis and [0, T ] along the complex one.
Then

N (T ) =

T

− 1(cid:17) + O (log T ) .

T h e o r e m A.4 (Landau’s formula). We have

Σ(x, T ) = −

Λ(nx)

eiT log(x/nx) − 1

2π

i log(x/nx)

where nx is the prime-power nearest to x and Σ is the exponential sum over
zeros deﬁned in (14). If x = nx, then the main term is −T Λ(x)/2π.

This result can be found in Ford & Zaharescu [3] and it is unconditional.

Conjecture 3 (Gonek). For x, T ≥ 2 we have

Σ(x, T ) ≪ T x−1/2+ε + T 1/2xε.
