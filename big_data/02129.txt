STRONG DEFORMATION RETRACTION OF THE SPACE

OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

ST´EPHANE SABOURAU

Abstract. We show that the inﬁnite-dimensional space of Zoll Finsler
metrics on the projective plane strongly deformation retracts to the
canonical round metric. In particular, this space of Zoll Finsler metrics
is connected. Moreover, the strong deformation retraction arises from a
deformation of the geodesic ﬂow of every Zoll Finsler projective plane
to the geodesic ﬂow of the round metric through a family of smooth free
circle actions induced by the curvature ﬂow of the canonical round pro-
jective plane. This construction provides a description of the geodesics
of the Zoll Finsler metrics along the retraction.

1. Introduction

A Zoll metric on a closed manifold M is a Riemannian or (reversible,
quadratically convex) Finsler metric all of whose geodesics are simple closed
curves of the same length. We refer to the classical reference [Be78] for an
introduction to the subject and historical comments, see also [B03]. Zoll
manifolds have ﬁnite fundamental groups. Thus, in the two-dimensional
case, they are diﬀeomorphic to either the sphere or the projective plane.
Note that the orientable double cover of a Zoll Finsler projective plane is a
Zoll Finsler two-sphere, cf. Proposition 3.1 or Remark 3.2.

The canonical round metric on the two-sphere or the projective plane
is a Zoll Riemannian metric. However, there exist Zoll Riemannian two-
spheres which are not round; some are rotationally symmetric, cf. [Be78,
§4], while others have no symmetry at all, cf. [Be78, Corollary 4.71]. Ac-
tually, Zoll Riemannian metrics on the two-sphere (modulo isometries and
rescaling) form an inﬁnite-dimensional space. Contrariwise, a Riemannian
metric on the projective plane is a Zoll metric if and only if it has constant
curvature, which follows from Green’s theorem, cf. [Be78, Theorem 5.59],
since the orientable double cover of a Zoll projective plane is a Blaschke
sphere. This also holds true in higher dimension, cf. [Be78, Appendix D].
However, this rigidity result fails in the Finsler case. Indeed, Zoll Finsler
metrics on the projective plane (modulo isometries and rescaling) form an
inﬁnite-dimensional space, cf. Appendix.

The goal of this article is to study the space of Zoll Finsler metrics on the
projective plane and the dynamics of their geodesic ﬂow. More speciﬁcally,
one can ask the following question about the topology of such space:

S. SABOURAU

Is the space of all Zoll Finsler metrics on any closed manifold connected
(when nonempty)?

In the Riemannian case, this is a famous question whose answer is only
known for the projective plane: the canonical round metric is the only Zoll
Riemannian metric on the projective plane modulo isometries and rescal-
ing. Even on the two-sphere, the question is wide open, cf. [B03, Ques-
tion 200]. (Observe that an approach through the Ricci ﬂow does not work
as shown in [J].) Now, in the Finsler case, Zoll metrics are much more
ﬂexible (as forementionned, their moduli space – if nonempty – is always
inﬁnite-dimensional, cf. Appendix) and the question still makes sense.

Our main result shows that the topology of the space of Zoll Finsler
metrics on the projective plane is homotopically trivial. This provides the
ﬁrst (positive) answer to the question above for Zoll Finsler metrics on the
projective plane.

Theorem 1.1. The space of Zoll Finsler metrics on the projective plane
whose geodesic length is equal to π strongly deformation retracts to the
canonical round metric on the projective plane.

Furthermore, this strong deformation retraction is induced by the curva-

ture ﬂow on the canonical round projective plane.

We emphasize that the deformation retraction is not given by some ab-
stract existence theorem but proceeds from a natural geometric construction
relying on the curvature ﬂow of the canonical round metric, cf. Theorem 1.3.
In particular, this implies that the geodesics of the Zoll Finsler metrics Fτ
along the deformation retraction from a given Zoll Finsler metric F are ob-
tained by applying the curvature ﬂow of the canonical round metric to the
geodesics of the given Zoll Finsler metric F . The construction of the defor-
mation retraction in Theorem 1.1 is fairly concrete. It relies on Theorem 1.3
below (and the material developed in the ﬁrst part of the article) and a
construction of Finsler metrics through the Crofton formula due to ´Alvarez
Paiva and Berck [AB]. This approach would carry over to the case of Zoll
Finsler metric on the two-sphere if one could deform the geodesics of these
metrics to the equators of the canonical round sphere while preserving their
intersection pattern.

The following result is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 1.1. It
immediately follows from a construction of [W75] (see also [G76, Appen-
dix B] for a more explicit statement) relying on Moser’s trick.

Corollary 1.2. Let (Fτ ) be the family of Zoll Finsler metrics on the pro-
jective plane M given by applying the retraction constructed in Theorem 1.1
to a Zoll Finsler metric F with geodesic length π. There exists a natural
one-parameter family of (homogeneous) symplectomorphisms

with F ∗
symplectically conjugate.

τ ◦ φτ = g∗
0.

φτ : T ∗M \ {0} → T ∗M \ {0}
In particular, the cogeodesic ﬂows of F and g0 are

Furthermore, the symplectomorphism φτ takes the cogeodesics of g0 to the
curves obtained from the (co)-geodesics of F by applying the curvature ﬂow
of the canonical round metric.

The symplectic conjugacy of the cogeodesic ﬂows of Zoll Finsler two-
spheres (and Zoll Finsler projective planes by taking their quotient) has
recently been established in [ABHS] by other means. Therefore, the state-
ment about the symplectic conjugacy in Corollary 1.2 is not new, but our
approach provides extra information on the symplectomorphisms φτ and
yields an alternative proof.

In the proof of our main theorem, we will need the following theorem
connecting the geodesic ﬂows of Zoll projective planes M . In this result,
we identify the unit tangent bundle SM of any Finsler metric on M with
the unit tangent bundle S0M of the canonical round metric g0 by radial
projection.

Theorem 1.3. Let (M, F ) be a Zoll Finsler projective plane. There exists a
natural one-parameter family of smooth free S1-actions (ρτ )0≤τ ≤1 on S0M

ρτ : S1 × S0M → S0M

between the geodesic ﬂows of F and g0 such that every ρτ -orbit projects to
an embedding of S1 into M under the canonical projection S0M → M .

Furthermore, this one-parameter family of actions is induced by the cur-

Here again, we emphasize that the family of circle actions (ρτ ) connecting
the two geodesic ﬂows proceeds in a natural way from the curvature ﬂow:
the ρτ -orbits correspond to the curves obtained from the F -geodesics by
applying the curvature ﬂow of the canonical round metric. This construction
makes the family (ρτ ) more trackable.

Actually, Theorem 1.3 directly follows from [H] once the intersection pat-
tern of closed geodesics on Zoll Finsler surfaces is established, cf. Section 3.
More precisely, the construction of the family of actions (ρt) follows from
Theorem 4.7, which is a particular case of a result of [H] on the curvature
ﬂow. Still, we decided to present a proof of Theorem 4.7, since the estimates
required in our case are weaker than those established in [H].

Speciﬁcally, the construction of the family of actions (ρτ ) proceeds as fol-
lows. First, we examine the inﬁnitesimal and non-inﬁnitesimal intersection
properties of the closed geodesics of Zoll Finsler two-spheres, cf. Section 3.
Then, we apply the curvature ﬂow of the canonical round sphere to simulta-
neously deform these simple closed curves into equators of the round sphere.
Here, we need to assume that the geodesics of the Zoll Finsler sphere di-
vide the sphere into two domains of the same g0-area, otherwise the curves
shrink to points under the curvature ﬂow of the canonical round sphere,
cf. Theorem 2.3. (This is the case on the orientable double cover of a Zoll
Finsler projective plane.) Note also that for arbitrary metrics on the two-
sphere, the curvature ﬂow may not converge as it may oscillate between
closed geodesics. However, it does converge to equators of the round sphere
when applied to simple curves dividing the round sphere into domains of the
same area, see Theorem 2.3 for a discussion about the convergence of the
curvature ﬂow. Lifting the curve deformations given by the curvature ﬂow
to the unit tangent bundle, we connect the geodesic ﬂow of the Zoll Finsler
metric to the geodesic ﬂow of the canonical round metric g0.

We do not know whether our results extend to non-reversible Finsler
metrics as several arguments only work in the reversible case. It would be
interesting to clarify this point.

2. Preliminaries

In this preliminary section, we go over constructions related to the ge-
odesic ﬂow of a Zoll Finsler metric and review the main features of the
curvature ﬂow on the canonical round two-sphere.

Deﬁnition 2.1. A (reversible) Finsler metric on a closed manifold M is
a continuous function F : T M → [0,∞) on the tangent bundle T M of M
satisfying the following properties (here, Fx := F|TxM for short):

(1) Smoothness: F is smooth outside the zero section;
(2) Homogeneity: Fx(tv) = |t| Fx(v) for every v ∈ TxM and t ∈ R;
(3) Quadratic convexity: for every x ∈ M , the function F 2

x has positive
deﬁnite second derivatives on TxM \ {0}, that is, for every p, u, v ∈
TxM , the symmetric bilinear for

gp(u, v) =

1
2

∂2
∂s∂t

F 2

x (p + tu + sv)|t=s=0

is an inner product.

x M is given by the dual norm F ∗
x .

The metric F induces a Minkowski norm Fx on each tangent space TxM .
We will denote by F ∗ : T ∗M → R the function whose restriction to each
cotangent space T ∗
The quadratically convex condition (as opposed to a mere convex condi-
tion) allows us to deﬁne a geodesic ﬂow for F acting on the unit tangent
bundle SM of M , cf. [Be78, §1]. The geodesic ﬂow of a Zoll Finsler mani-
fold (M, F ) of geodesic length 2π is periodic and deﬁnes a smooth free action
of S1 = R/2πZ on SM

given by

ρF : S1 → Diﬀ(SM )
ρF (θ)(v) = γ′

v(θ)

where γv is the (arclength parametrized) F -geodesic induced by v.

Recall that the quotient manifold theorem asserts that if G is a Lie group
acting smoothly, freely and properly on a smooth manifold N , then the
quotient space N/G is a topological manifold with a unique smooth structure
such that the quotient map N → N/G is a smooth submersion. This result
applies to the S1-action ρF of the geodesic ﬂow of F on SM .

Denote by

the quotient manifold and by

ΓF = SM/ρF

the quotient submersion. The quotient manifold ΓF represents the space
of unparametrized oriented geodesics of the Zoll Finsler manifold (M, F ).

When M is a two-sphere, the space ΓF is diﬀeomorphic to S2 as it follows
from the homotopy exact sequence of the ﬁbration qF , cf. [Be78, §2.10].

Let us review the main features of the curvature ﬂow on the canonical

round two-sphere.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let γ : S1 → M be a smooth embedded curve on the
canonical round two-sphere M . There exists a homotopy γt : S1 → M
evolving according to the equation

∂γt
∂t

= κ n

where κ is the curvature of γ in M and n is its unit normal vector.

This ﬂow, referred to as the curvature ﬂow on the canonical round two-
sphere, is deﬁned for a maximal time interval [0, T ), where T is ﬁnite if and
only if (γt) converges to a point when t tends to T , cf. [Gr89].

We summarize the properties of the curvature ﬂow on the canonical round

two-sphere that we will need in this article as follows.

Theorem 2.3 ([A91], [Ga90], [Gr89]). The curvature ﬂow (γt) of an embed-
ded closed curve γ on the canonical round two-sphere satisﬁes the following
properties:

(1) the length of γt decreases unless γ is a geodesic, in which case the

ﬂow is constant;

(2) the curves γt remain embedded, cf. [Ga90, Theorem 3.1] (see also [A91,

Theorem 1.3]);

(3) two disjoint smooth simple curves γ1 and γ2 remain disjoint through
the curvature ﬂow, that is, γ1,t and γ2,t are disjoint, unless one of
them shrinks to a point, cf. [A91, §1].
verges to a point, cf. [Gr89];

(4) the curvature of γt converges to zero in the C ∞-norm unless γt con-

(5) if γ divides the round sphere into two domains with the same area
then the curves γt also divide the round sphere into two domains
with the same area, cf. [Ga90, Proof of Theorem 5.1], and converge
to an equator as unparametrized curves.

(6) if γ does not divide the round sphere into two domains with the same

area then the curvature ﬂow (γt) converges to a point.

Proof. The second part of the point (5) on the convergence of the curva-
ture ﬂow to an equator follows by combining the works of Gage [Ga90] and
Grayson [Gr89]. Indeed, from the ﬁrst part of the point (5), the curves γt
divide the round sphere into two domains with the same area. In partic-
ular, the curvature ﬂow (γt) of γ does not converge to a point. From the
point (4), its curvature converges to zero in the C ∞-norm and, since the
loops γt are simple, its length tends to 2π. In particular, its total geodesic
√κ2 + 1 ds tends to 2π, and so, is less than 3π for t large
enough. This ensures that the two conditions of Theorem 5.1 in [Ga90] are
satisﬁed. Therefore, we conclude that the curvature ﬂow (γt) converges to
an equator as unparametrized curves.

curvature Rγt

For the point (6), let Dt be the domain of the round two-sphere bounded
by the simple closed curve γt such that the orientation of Dt induces the

6

S. SABOURAU

same orientation as γt on its boundary. By the Gauss-Bonnet formula, the
area of Dt satisﬁes

From [Ga90, Lemma 1.3], we have

|Dt| = 2π −Zγt

κt ds.

d

dt|Dt| = −Zγt

κt ds = |Dt| − 2π.

Therefore, |Dt| = (|D0| − 2π)et + 2π. Since |D0| 6= 2π, it follows that the
curvature ﬂow of γ is only deﬁned on a ﬁnite time interval. Hence, the
result.
(cid:3)

3. Geodesic intersections on Zoll Finsler two-spheres

In this section, we examine some features satisﬁed by the geodesics of Zoll

Finsler two-spheres.

The following result is established in [LM02] for Riemannian metrics but

the proof carries over to Finsler metrics.

Proposition 3.1 ([LM02, Proposition 2.21]). Let (M, F ) be a Finsler two-
sphere. The following assertions are equivalent:

(i) all the geodesics of F are simple closed curves;
(ii) all the geodesics of F are simple closed curves of the same length.

In particular, the orientable double cover of a Zoll Finsler projective plane

of geodesic length π is a Zoll Finsler two-sphere of geodesic length 2π.

Remark 3.2. One could directly prove the last statement of Proposition 3.1.
Simply observe that a noncontractible geodesic on a Finsler projective plane
cannot be approached by a contractible one of the same length. Thus, all
the simple closed geodesics on a Zoll Finsler projective plane lift to simple
closed geodesics of twice their length.

The following result clariﬁes the intersection pattern of geodesics on Zoll
Finlser surfaces. Although the result is not surprising, we were unable to
ﬁnd a reference for it in the literature.

Theorem 3.3. Let (M, F ) be a Zoll Finsler two-sphere. Every pair of dis-
tinct (closed) geodesics has exactly two (transverse) intersection points.
Proof. Let G = ΓF /± be the space of unparametrized geodesics of F . First,
observe that two distinct (unparametrized) closed geodesics are either dis-
joint or have only transverse intersection points. Now, ﬁx a closed geo-
desic γ of F . For every nonnegative integer k, consider the space Gγ,k of
closed geodesics diﬀerent from γ, intersecting γ at exactly k (transverse)
points. The space Gγ,k is clearly open in G \ {γ} as every closed geodesic
close enough to a geodesic γ in Gγ,k still has exactly k transverse intersection
points with γ. Observe that the open sets Gγ,k are disjoint and cover G \{γ}
for k running over all the nonnegative integers. That is,

G \ {γ} = ak∈N

Gγ,k.

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

7

By connectedness of G \ {γ}, we conclude that G \ {γ} = Gγ,k for some
nonnegative integer kγ. That is, every closed geodesic diﬀerent from γ in-
tersects γ at exactly kγ points.

Denote Gγ = Gγ,kγ . Observe that the integer kγ does not depend on γ.
Indeed, for every γ1, γ2 ∈ G with γ1 6= γ2, we have |γ1 ∩ γ2| = kγ1 since γ2 ∈
G \ {γ1} = Gγ1 , and, by symmetry, |γ1 ∩ γ2| = kγ2 since γ1 ∈ G \ {γ2} = Gγ2.
Hence, kγ1 = kγ2.
Thus, every pair of distinct closed geodesics has exactly k (transverse)
intersection points, where the integer k only depends on the dynamics of
the geodesic ﬂow of F . This integer is at least two for topological reasons.
Let γ1 and γ2 be two distinct closed geodesics. Since the closed geodesics
γ1 and γ2 are simple, there exists a connected component D of M \ (γ1 ∪ γ2)
bounded by exactly two geodesic arcs (one lying in γ1 and the other lying
in γ2). This connected component forms a bigon with endpoints p and q.
Changing the parametrization of γ1 and γ2 if necessary, we can assume that
the tangent vectors v1 = γ′
2(0) based at p span a sector
in TpM pointing inside D, cf. Figure 1.

Observe that the connected component D continuously varies with γ1
and γ2 as long as v1 and v2 are not collinear. In particular, by rotating v1
to v2 and v2 to −v1, we deform γ1 to γ2 and γ2 to −γ1 through two ho-
motopies of simple closed geodesics γt
2. Through this process, the
digon D bounded by the two arcs of γ1 and γ2 joining p to q and directed
by v1 and v2 deforms through a family of digons Dt bounded by the two
2 and directed by vt
arcs of γt

2. The digon Dt is a connected component of M \ (γt
and vt
2). By con-
1 and γt
struction, the point qt is the ﬁrst point of intersection of γt
2 when
travelling along these two geodesics from p in the directions of vt
2. At
the ﬁnal time t = 1, the geodesics γ1
2 agree with γ2 and −γ1. Hence,
q1 agrees with q. This implies that the two digons D and D1, which are
connected components of M \ (γ1 ∪ γ2), form a disk with boundary γ1, split
by an arc of γ2. As a result, the closed geodesics γ1 and γ2 have exactly two
intersection points, namely p and q. Hence, k = 2.

In the rest of this section, we introduce the (non-metric) notion of normal
vector ﬁelds along simple loops on a surface. We also determine the number
of zeros of nontrivial normal vector ﬁelds deﬁned by geodesic variations on
a Zoll Finsler two-sphere.
Deﬁnition 3.4. Given a closed surface M , let c : S1 × (−ε, ε) → M be a
smooth map inducing a smooth variation of embedded curves cλ = c(., λ)

8

S. SABOURAU

with λ ∈ (−ε, ε). Here, the curves cλ are not necessarily geodesics. Deﬁne
the following vector ﬁeld Y ∈ Γ(c∗

0T M ) along c0 as

Y (θ) =

(θ, 0)

∂c
∂λ

for every θ ∈ S1. When the curves cλ are geodesics for some Finsler metric F
on M , the vector ﬁeld Y represents the Jacobi ﬁeld along c0 generated by
the geodesic variation (cλ), cf. [S01, §11.2]. The vector ﬁeld Y induces a
normal vector ﬁeld Y⊥ along c0 deﬁned as

Y⊥(θ) ≡ Y (θ) mod R.c′

0(θ)

for every θ ∈ S1, where Y⊥(θ) lies in the quotient of the plane Tc0(θ)M by the
vector line R.c′
0(θ). On an orientable surface, a normal
vector ﬁeld along c0 is merely a function.

0(θ) generated by c′

We start with the following observation showing that the notion of normal
vector ﬁeld extends to variations of unparametrized (oriented or unoriented)
embedded curves.

Lemma 3.5. Let c0 be a curve in a closed manifold M . The normal vector
ﬁeld Y⊥ along c0 induced by a curve variation (cλ) does not depend on the
parametrization of the curves cλ.
Proof. Consider a variation of curves ¯cλ(·) = cλ(θ(·, λ)), where θ(·, λ) rep-
resents a regular change of parameter. At θ = θ(¯θ, 0), the points ¯c0(¯θ)
and c0(θ) agree as well as the lines generated by ¯c′
0(θ). Now, the
vector ﬁeld ¯Y induced by the curve variation (¯cλ) satisﬁes

0(¯θ) and c′

¯Y (¯θ) =

(¯θ, 0)

∂¯c

(θ, 0) +

0(θ)

(¯θ, 0) c′

0(θ)

Hence, ¯Y⊥(¯θ) = Y⊥(θ) at the point ¯c0(¯θ) = c0(θ).

(cid:3)

The following property satisﬁed by every normal Jacobi vector ﬁeld Y⊥
of a Zoll Finsler two-sphere can be seen as an inﬁnitesimal version of Theo-
rem 3.3.

Theorem 3.6 ([LM02, Theorem 2.15]). Let (M, F ) be a Zoll Finsler two-
sphere. Every nontrivial normal Jacobi vector ﬁeld Y⊥ induced by a variation
of an unparametrized (oriented or unoriented) geodesic γ has exactly two
zeros.

Furthermore, the zeros of Y⊥ are simple, that is, the vector ﬁelds Y⊥ and

(Y⊥)′ do not simultaneously vanish.

Proof. The ﬁrst statement of the proposition is established in [LM02, The-
orem 2.15] for Zoll torsion-free aﬃne connexions on the two-sphere. The
arguments carry over in our setting. For the sake of the reader and since
the arguments are so elegant, we brieﬂy reproduce them.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that γ is an unparametrized
oriented geodesic. Consider the quotient submersion q : SM → Γ induced by

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

9

the geodesic ﬂow of F , where Γ = ΓF represents the space of unparametrized
oriented geodesics of F , cf. (2.1). Denote by P T Γ the projectivized tangent
space of Γ. The submersion q : SM → Γ factors through a map ϕ : SM →
P T Γ under the canonical projection P T Γ → Γ. That is, the following
diagram is commutative

P T Γ

ϕ

;✇✇✇✇✇✇✇✇✇

SM

q

/ Γ

The map ϕ can be deﬁned as follows. Identify the tangent plane of Γ at γ
with the space of normal Jacobi ﬁelds along γ, cf. [Be78, Proposition 2.13].
With this identiﬁcation, the map ϕ takes a unit vector v ∈ SxM with base-
point x ∈ M to the class of normal Jacobi vector ﬁelds along γv vanishing
at x. Note that the map ϕ takes every orbit of the geodesic ﬂow of F to a
diﬀerent ﬁber of the projection P T Γ → Γ. Observe also that the map ϕ is
a local diﬀeomorphism and so a covering since SM is compact.

The index of the covering is given by
|π1(P T Γ)|
|π1(SM )|

=

4
2

= 2

since Γ ≃ S2 and SM ≃ RP 3.
Now, two vectors u and v of SM are sent by ϕ to the same class [Y⊥]
of a nontrivial normal Jacobi ﬁeld Y⊥ along a geodesic γ if and only if γu
and γv represent the same unparametrized oriented geodesic γ, and their
basepoints are zeros of Y⊥.

By deﬁnition of the index of a covering, every class of a nontrivial normal
Jacobi ﬁeld along γ has two preimages by ϕ. It follows that Y⊥ has exactly
two zeros.

For the second statement, recall that every Jacobi ﬁeld Y along c0 satisﬁes
a second-order linear diﬀerential equation, and so does the normal vector
ﬁeld Y⊥, cf. [LM02, Equation (3)] or [S01, §11.2], namely

Y ′′
⊥ + κ Y⊥ = 0

where κ is a smooth function. Hence, the zeros of Y⊥ are simple unless Y⊥
is trivial.
(cid:3)

4. Curvature flow and circle action deformations on the unit

tangent bundles of Zoll Finsler two-spheres

By analyzing the parabolic partial diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the
curvature ﬂow of the canonical round two-sphere, we show that this ﬂow in-
duces an isotopy of diﬀeomorphisms of the unit tangent bundles of balanced
Zoll Finsler spheres. As mentioned in the introduction, several results of
this section can be derived from [H].

Let (M, F ) be a Zoll Finsler two-sphere. The unit tangent bundle SM
of (M, F ) naturally identiﬁes with the unit tangent bundle S0M of the



canonical two-sphere (M, g0) by radial projection on each tangent plane.
More precisely, the two radial projections

and

π♭ : SM → S0M

(4.1)

π♯ : S0M → SM

(4.2)
are reciprocal to each other. We will refer to these diﬀeomorphisms as
musical diﬀeomorphisms. With this identiﬁcation, the smooth free action
of S1 on SM given by the geodesic ﬂow F induces a smooth free action
on S0M by conjugacy by the musical diﬀeomorphisms π♭ and π♯. This S1-
action is denoted by

ρ : S1 → Diﬀ(S0M )
ρ(θ)(v) = π♭[γ′
π♯(v)(θ)]

and deﬁned as

(4.3)
for every θ ∈ S1 and v ∈ S0M . Observe that the orbits of the actions of S1
on SM and S0M project down to embedded closed curves in M , namely
the F -geodesics γv.

Deﬁnition 4.1. A Zoll Finsler two-sphere (M, F ) is balanced if every F -
geodesic of M divides the round sphere into two domains D1 and D2 with
the same g0-area, where g0 is the canonical round metric. This property is
satisﬁed if (M, F ) is invariant under the antipodal map, that is, if it is the
orientable double cover of a Zoll Finsler projective plane.

Remark 4.2. We introduce the notion of balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere
for the following reason. On a balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere (M, F ),
the simple closed geodesics γv induced by the vectors v ∈ SM converge
to equators of the canonical round sphere (M, g0) through the curvature
ﬂow γt
v of (M, g0), cf. Theorem 2.3.(5). While if (M, F ) is not balanced, the
convergence does not hold anymore since a simple closed curve not dividing
the round sphere into two domains with the same area shrinks to a point
through the curvature ﬂow of the round sphere, cf. Theorem 2.3.(6).

On every balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere (M, F ), consider the map

deﬁned as

Ψt : S0M → S0M

Ψt(v) = π♭[(γt

π♯(v))′(0)]

for every v ∈ S0M and t ∈ [0,∞). Here, γv is the F -geodesic induced
by v and (γt
v) is the curvature ﬂow of γv on the canonical round sphere,
cf. Deﬁnition 2.2. Note that Ψ0 is the identity map on S0M .

We will need the following classical result about the number of zeros of a

parabolic partial diﬀerential equation.
Theorem 4.3 (see [A88, Theorem C]). Let u : S1× [0, T ] → R be a bounded
solution of the equation

ut = a(x, t) uxx + b(x, t) ux + c(x, t) u

where a, a−1, at, ax, axx, b, bt, bx and c are bounded functions. Then, for
every t ∈ (0, T ), the number z(t) of zeros of u(., t) is ﬁnite.

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

11

Furthermore, if both u and ux vanish at (x0, t0) then z(t−) > z(t+) for
every t− < t0 < t+. That is, the number of zeros decreases whenever a
multiple zero occurs.

We can now show the following result.

Proposition 4.4. Let (M, F ) be a balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere. For
every t ∈ [0,∞), the map Ψt : S0M → S0M induced by the curvature ﬂow
of the canonical round sphere is an immersion.

Proof. By deﬁnition, Ψt(.) = π♭[(γt
π♯(.))′(0)], where the maps π♭ and π♯ are
diﬀeomorphisms. Thus, the map Ψt is an immersion if and only if the map

deﬁned as Ξt(v) = (γt

Ξt : SM → T M
v)′(0) is an immersion.

For t = 0, this clearly holds true.
Indeed, by construction, Ξ0(v) =
v )′(0) = v for every v ∈ SM . That is, the map Ξ0 is the inclusion map
(γ0
and so is an immersion.

Fix v ∈ SM and τ ∈ (0,∞). Let w = w(λ) be a smooth curve in SM
with w(0) = v. Denote ν = w′(0). For the sake of simplicity, we will
sometimes write γλ for γw(λ). Note that γ0 = γv. We want to show that
the diﬀerential d Ξτ (v) of Ξτ at v is injective. That is, if the derivative
d Ξτ (v)(ν) of Ξτ (w(λ)) vanishes at λ = 0 then the vector ν = w′(0) of T SM
is zero. The idea is to write down in local coordinates the partial diﬀerential
equation satisﬁed by Ξτ (w) and to study the evolution of the normal Jacobi
ﬁeld given by the geodesic variation (γw).

By Theorem 2.3.(2), the curve γτ

v deﬁnes an embedding of S1 into M . This
embedding extends to an embedding h : S1×(−1, 1) → M of a cylinder onto
a collar neighborhood of γτ
v , which gives rise to a normal coordinate system
with h(., 0) = γτ

v in the canonical round sphere.
In this normal coordinate system around γτ

λ with (λ, t)
close enough to (0, τ ) can be represented in a nonparametric way as the
graph

v , every curve γt

{(x, u(x, t, λ)) ∈ S1 × (−1, 1) | x ∈ S1}

of a function u(., t, λ) over S1. Observe that u(x, τ, 0) = 0 for every x ∈ S1.
From [A90, Eq. (3.2)] or [Ga90, Appendix], the function
u : S1 × (τ − δ, τ + δ) × (−ε, ε) → (−1, 1)

satisﬁes the following parabolic partial diﬀerential equation of the curvature
ﬂow:

ut = F(x, u, ux, uxx)

where F is a smooth function deﬁned on S1×(−1, 1)×R2 with Fq(x, u, p, q) > 0,
which can be expressed in terms of the coeﬃcients of the canonical round
metric in the normal coordinate system. Here, the subscript notations refer
to partial diﬀerentiations.

In a parametric representation, the abscisse of γt

λ is a function of the

parameter θ, that is, x = x(θ, t, λ) with x(θ, τ, 0) = θ. Thus,

γt
λ(θ) = (x(θ, t, λ), u(x(θ, t, λ), t, λ)).

λ)′(θ) which can be represented as

Diﬀerentiating this expression with respect to θ yields the tangent vec-
tor (γt
(γt
or

λ)′(θ) = (x(θ, t, λ), u(x(θ, t, λ), t, λ), xθ (θ, t, λ), ux(x(θ, t, λ), t, λ) xθ(θ, t, λ))

(γt

λ)′(θ) = (x, u, xθ, ux xθ)

(4.4)

for short.

Note that Ξt(w) = (γt

w)′(0). Thus, the diﬀerential of Ξt at v in the
direction ν = w′(0) is obtained by diﬀerentiating the relation (4.4) with
respect to λ at λ = 0. That is,

d Ξt(v)(ν) = (xλ, ux xλ + uλ, xθλ, uxx xθ xλ + uxλ xθ + ux xθλ)

evaluated at (0, t, 0). Observing that xθ(0, τ, 0) = 1, we simplify this expres-
sion as follows

d Ξτ (v)(ν) = (xλ, ux xλ + uλ, xθλ, uxx xλ + uxλ + ux xθλ).

Now, suppose that ν lies in the kernel of the diﬀerential d Ξτ (v) of Ξτ
at v, that is, d Ξτ (v)(ν) = 0. In this case, the functions xλ, uλ, xθλ and uxλ
vanish at (0, τ, 0). Hence, both v and vx vanish at (0, τ, 0), where v = uλ.
That is, the function v has a multiple zero at (0, τ, 0).

Now, in a more intrinsic way, the zeros of v can be related to the zeros of
λ) as follows. The

v)′ and Y t, cf. (4.4) and (4.5), that the normal vector
the expression of (γt
ﬁeld Y t
⊥ deﬁned in Deﬁnition 3.4 vanishes if and only if v = uλ vanishes.
More precisely,

where v(x, t) = uλ(x, t, 0) and x = x(θ, t, 0).

Y t
⊥(θ) = 0 ⇔ v(x, t) = 0

(4.6)

The number of zeros of Y t

⊥ is given by the following result.

⊥ has exactly two zeros along γt

Lemma 4.5. The normal vector ﬁeld Y t
every t ≥ 0.
Proof. At t = 0, the curves γ0
λ are geodesic for the Zoll Finsler metric F . It
follows from Theorem 3.6 that Y 0
⊥ has exactly two zeros along γv. Moreover,
these zeros are simple. By the implicit function theorem, we deduce that
⊥ has exactly two zeros along γt
Y t
Let us examine how the number of zeros of Y t

v for every t > 0 small enough.

⊥ evolves with t for every

v for

t > 0. Diﬀerentiating the partial diﬀerential equation

ut = F(x, u, ux, uxx)
with respect to λ yields the following expression

uλt = Fu(x, u, ux, uxx) uλ + Fp(x, u, ux, uxx) uλx + Fq(x, u, ux, uxx) uλxx.

Thus, the function v = uλ satisﬁes the parabolic partial diﬀerential equation
(4.7)

vt = a(x, t, λ) vxx + b(x, t, λ) vx + c(x, t, λ) v

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

13

where a = Fq(x, u, ux, uxx), b = Fp(x, u, ux, uxx) and c = Fu(x, u, ux, uxx).
Therefore, the number of zeros of the normal vector ﬁeld Y t
⊥ along γt
nonincreasing too from the relation (4.6). Since Y t
for t small enough, it follows that Y t

By Theorem 4.3, the number of zeros of v(., t) is nonincreasing with t.

Now, if Y t

two zeros along γt

v and γt

v for every t.

Let us continue the proof of Proposition 4.4. Combined with (4.6),
Lemma 4.5 shows that the function v(., t) has a constant number of ze-
ros, namely two, for every t ≥ 0. Since v satisﬁes the parabolic partial
diﬀerential equation (4.7), we deduce from Theorem 4.3 that the functions
v and vx do not simultaneously vanish. Thus, the diﬀerential of Ξτ at v is
injective. Hence the result.
(cid:3)

The previous propositions yield the following result.

Theorem 4.6. Let (M, F ) be a balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere. For every
t ∈ [0,∞), the map Ψt : S0M → S0M induced by the curvature ﬂow of the
canonical round sphere is a diﬀeomorphism.

Proof. From Proposition 4.4 and since S0M is compact, the map Ψt is a
proper local diﬀeomorphism. Therefore, it is a covering map. Now, the
map Ψt is π1-injective (this is clearly the case for Ψ0 and this property is
preserved under homotopy). Hence, the covering Ψt is a diﬀeomorphism for
every t ≥ 0.
(cid:3)

This isotopy of diﬀeomorphisms allows us to deﬁne a deformation ρt of
the geodesic ﬂow ρ0 = ρ of balanced Zoll Finsler spheres, cf. (4.3), to the
geodesic ﬂow of the canonical round sphere as follows.

Let (M, F ) be a balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere. For every v ∈ S0M ,
consider the unique curve γt
u tangent to v at θ = 0 and pointing in the same
direction as v. That is, u = Ψ−1
t (v) under the identiﬁcation S0M = SM .
Reparametrize this curve proportionally to its g0-arclength preserving both
its initial point and its orientation. Deﬁne the S1-action

ρt : S1 → Diﬀ(S0M )

such that ρt(θ) takes v to the tangent vector of this new curve at the point
of parameter θ. Since Ψt is a diﬀeomorphism, the map ρt(θ) is also a dif-
feomorphism of S0M . Clearly, the S1-action ρt on S0M is free and satisﬁes
the symmetry property

ρt(θ)(−v) = −ρt(−θ)(v)

(4.8)
for every t ∈ [0,∞), θ ∈ S1 = R/2πZ and v ∈ S0M . Moreover, every
ρt-orbit projects to an embedding of S1 into M by the canonical projec-
tion S0M → M . It is also worth pointing out that the expression of ρt(θ)(v)
vary smoothly with respect to t ∈ [0,∞), θ ∈ S1 and v ∈ S0M .

14

S. SABOURAU

Thus deﬁned, the actions ρt satisfy the following convergence result which

implies Theorem 1.3 by passing to the quotient.

Theorem 4.7. Let (M, F ) be a balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere. Then the
smooth free S1-actions

ρt : S1 × S0M → S0M

converge to the action ρ∞ induced by the geodesic ﬂow of the canonical round
sphere.

Furthermore, for t ∈ [0,∞], every ρt-orbit projects to an embedding of S1

into M under the canonical projection S0M → M .
Proof. It follows from Theorem 2.3 that for every ε > 0 and every t ≥ 0
large enough, the unparametrized loops γt
u have curvature at most ε on the
canonical round sphere. In particular, these loops are uniformly close to the
equators to which they are tangent (in the smooth Fr´echet topology). By
construction, this implies that the action ρt is close to the action ρ∞ induced
by the g0-geodesic ﬂow for t large enough.

The last statement about the orbits of ρt is also satisﬁed since these orbits
are transverse to the ﬁbers of S0M → M and project to the images of the
F -geodesics under the curvature ﬂow (which do not self-intersect).

(cid:3)

Remark 4.8. This convergence result shows that the one-parameter family
of S1-actions (ρt) is deﬁned for t ∈ [0,∞]. In the rest of this article, we will
consider a reparametrization (ρτ ) of this family for τ ∈ [0, 1] with τ = t
t+1 .

5. Crofton formula on Zoll Finsler two-spheres

We review some constructions on Zoll Finsler two-spheres (M, F ) all of
whose geodesics are of length 2π, including the general Crofton formula on
Finsler surfaces.

Let L : T M → T ∗M be the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian 1

2 F 2.
Since F is quadratically convex, the Legendre transform is a diﬀeomorphism
between T M and T ∗M . By homogeneity of F , it preserves the norm on
each ﬁber of the bundle vectors T M and T ∗M .
In particular, it induces
a diﬀeomorphism between the unit sphere bundle and the unit co-sphere
bundle SM and S∗M . Geometrically, this diﬀeomorphism is deﬁned as
follows: for every vector v ∈ SxM , the image L(v) of v is the unique covector
of S∗

xM such that L(v)(v) = 1.
From now on, we will identify T M with T ∗M and SM with S∗M via
the Legendre transform. Recall that we also identify SM with the unit
tangent bundle S0M of the canonical round sphere under the musical dif-
feomorphisms π♭ and π♯, cf. (4.2) and (4.1). With these identiﬁcations, the
action ρF of S1 on SM given by the geodesic ﬂow of F induces an action
on S∗M by conjugacy by the Legendre transform, namely the co-geodesic
ﬂow of F , and an action on S∗
0 M by conjugacy both by the Legendre trans-
form and the musical diﬀeomorphisms. Despite the risk of confusion, all
these S1-actions will be denoted by ρF .

Let α be the tautological one-form on T ∗M . By deﬁnition,

αξ(V ) = ξ(dπξ(V ))

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

15

for every ξ ∈ T ∗M and V ∈ TξT ∗M , where π : T ∗M → M is the canon-
ical surjection. From the Liouville theorem, the tautological one-form α
(and so the symplectic form ω = dα) is invariant under the co-geodesic
ﬂow of any Finsler metric. Observe also that the S1-orbits of ρF on S∗M
and S∗
0M are transverse to the contact structures given by the kernels of α
and π∗
♯ (α). Now, the pull-back of the 3-form α∧ dα under the inclusion map
S∗M ֒→ T ∗M deﬁnes a volume form on S∗M . (That is, the pull-back of α
is a contact one-form on S∗M .) Since S∗M is the unit cotangent bundle of
a Finsler sphere all of whose geodesics are closed of lengh 2π, the integral
of this volume form on S∗M does not depend on the Finsler metric and is
equal to ± 8π2 by a result of A. Weinstein, cf. [Be78, §2.C]. That is,

ZS ∗M

α ∧ dα =ZS ∗

0 M

α ∧ dα = ± 8π2.

(5.1)

By the quotient manifold theorem, the S1-action on S∗

0M given by the

co-geodesic ﬂow ρF gives rise to a quotient manifold

ΓF = S∗

0 M/ρF

diﬀeomorphic to S2, representing the space of unparametrized oriented geodesics
of the Zoll Finsler two-sphere (M, F ), and a quotient submersion

qF : S∗

0 M → ΓF .

By construction, the map qF takes a unit cotangent vector of M to the un-
parametrized oriented F -geodesic of M with the Legendre transform of this
unit cotangent vector as initial condition. Thus, the projection π(q−1
F (γ)) of
a ﬁber over γ represents the unparametrized closed geodesic of (M, F ) given
by γ ∈ ΓF . We will sometimes identify γ with π(q−1

F (γ)).

The general Crofton formula on Finsler surfaces can be stated as follows.

Theorem 5.1 ([AB06, Theorem 5.2]). With the previous notations, the
length of every smooth curve c on (M, F ) satisﬁes

lengthF (c) =

1

4Zγ∈ΓF

#(γ ∩ c)|λF|

(5.3)

where |λF| is the smooth positive area density on ΓF induced by the sym-
plectic form λF .

Remark 5.2. Strictly speaking, the integrand in the formula (5.3) should
be #(π(q−1
F (γ)) ∩ c) instead of #(γ ∩ c), but as aforementioned, we identify
the elements γ in ΓF with the unparametrized geodesics π(q−1
F (γ)) they
represent.

Remark 5.3. The Crofton formula (5.3) shows that the Zoll Finsler met-
ric F is uniquely determined by the submersion qF : S∗
0M → ΓF (and the
symplectic form λF on ΓF derived from qF ).

6. Deforming Zoll Finsler two-spheres

In this section, we construct a natural deformation of Zoll Finsler two-
spheres to the canonical round two-sphere by applying the Crofton formula
to the orbits of the converging family of circle actions given by the curvature
ﬂow, cf. Theorem 4.7.

Consider a Zoll Finsler two-sphere (M, F ) all of whose geodesics are of
0 M whose orbits are
♯ (α). (Recall that
♭ and π∗
♯ .)
0M → Γρ the submersion induced by the free S1-action ρ,

Along with the S1-action ρ, this volume form gives rise to a two-form ¯ω = ¯ωρ

0M . Here, despite the ambiguity in
the notation, dρ(θ)|ξ denotes the diﬀerential of the diﬀeomorphism ρ(θ) :
0M → S∗
S∗
0M at ξ. By construction, the two-form ¯ωρ is ρ-invariant and
projects to a two-form λρ on the quotient surface Γρ = S∗

0M/ρ with

¯ωρ = q∗

ρ λρ.

Up to the multiplicative factor 1
2π , the form λρ is the two-form induced by Ω
by integration along the ﬁbers of qρ (that is, the push-forward of Ω by the
ﬁbration qρ). Note that both two-forms ¯ωρ and λρ are determined by ρ.

We have the following straightforward result.

Lemma 6.1. The two-form λρ does not vanish (and so deﬁnes an area-form
on Γρ).

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

17

Proof. Consider two independent vectors ¯u and ¯v based at the same point
tangent to Γρ. Let u and v be two lifts of ¯u and ¯v, based at the same
point ξ ∈ S∗
0 M , under the submersion qρ. That is, the vectors u and v
tangent to S∗
0M at ξ project to ¯u and ¯v under dqρ. By construction, we
have

λρ(¯u, ¯v) = ¯ωξ(u, v).

Furthermore, for every θ ∈ S1, the vectors dρ(θ)|ξ(u) and dρ(θ)|ξ(v) also
project to ¯u and ¯v under dqρ. Now, since the vector d
dθ ρ(θ)(ξ) is tangent
to the ﬁbers of qρ, it follows that the three vectors dρ(θ)|ξ(u), dρ(θ)|ξ(v)
and d
0 M . Thus, the value of the volume
form Ωρ(θ)(ξ) at these vectors is nonzero (and so of constant sign) for every
θ ∈ S1. From the expression (6.3), we conclude that both ¯ωξ(u, v) and
λρ(¯u, ¯v) are nonzero. Hence the result.

dθ ρ(θ)(ξ) form a basis of Tρ(θ)(ξ)S∗

(cid:3)

By ﬁber integration and Fubini’s theorem, we have the following relation

ZS ∗

0 M

Ω = 2πZΓρ

λρ.

In particular, the integral of the (non-vanishing) area-from |λρ| over Γρ is
equal to 4π when ρ is given by the co-geodesic ﬂow of F , cf. (5.1).

From now on, suppose that the S1-action ρ is symmetric, that is,

ρ(θ)(−ξ) = −ρ(−θ)(ξ)

for every θ ∈ S1 = R/2πZ and ξ ∈ S∗
0M . This is the case when ρ is given by
the co-geodesic ﬂow of F , and more generally, by its one-parameter family
of deformations (ρτ )0≤τ ≤1 deﬁned at the end of Section 4, cf. (4.8). The
symmetric S1-action ρ induces a submersion
0M → Γρ

pρ : S∗

as follows

pρ(ξ) = γ ⇔ ker ξ is tangent to the non-oriented curve γ

where ξ ∈ S∗
0 M and γ ∈ Γρ. Clearly, the map pρ induces a submersion
P T ∗M → Γρ to the quotient P T ∗M = S∗
0M/± representing the space of
contact elements of M . The ﬁbers of this submersion are transverse to
those of the canonical projection P T ∗M → M . Furthermore, these ﬁbers
are Legendrian with respect to the contact structure induced by α. Indeed,
let ξ ∈ p−1
ρ (γ). The vector dπξ(V ), based at π(ξ), is
tangent to γ. Hence, ξ(dπξ(V )) = 0 since pρ(ξ) = 0, by deﬁnition of pρ.
That is, αξ(V ) = 0 for every V ∈ Tξp−1
ρ (γ). Note also that the product map
π × pρ : S∗

0M → M × Γρ is an embedding.

ρ (γ) and V ∈ Tξp−1

We can now apply the results of [AB] asserting that a (non-vanishing)
area-form on Γρ gives rise to a Finsler metric on M via the Crofton formula.

Theorem 6.2 ([AB, Theorem 2.2]). With the previous notations, there ex-
ists a unique Finsler metric Fρ on M satisfying the Crofton formula

lengthFρ(c) =

1

4Zγ∈Γρ

#(γ ∩ c)|λρ|

(6.4)

18

S. SABOURAU

for any smooth curve c on M .

Morevover, the Finsler metric Fρ admits the following expression:
every x ∈ M , there exists a unique non-vanishing one-form βx on S∗
such that

for
xM

Fρ(x; v) =Zξ∈S ∗

xM |ξ(v)| βx

(6.5)

(6.6)

for every v ∈ TxM , where the non-vanishing one-form βx is deﬁned for every
ξ ∈ S∗

xM by the relation

Furthermore, the one-form βx smoothly depends on x.

(¯ωρ)(x,ξ) = π∗ξ ∧ β(x,ξ).

Note that the relation (6.6) allows us to deﬁne the one-form β(x,ξ) in a

unique way only on TξS∗

xM , not on T(x,ξ)S∗M .

Before making use of Theorem 6.2, let us mention three important obser-

vations that will be useful in the proof of Theorem 6.6 below.

The ﬁrst one deals with the dependance of Fρ with respect to ρ.

Remark 6.3. By construction, both forms ¯ωρ and β = βρ, cf. (6.2) and (6.6),
continuously vary with the S1-action ρ. It follows from the expression of Fρ,
cf. (6.5), that the Finsler metric Fρ continuously varies with ρ too.

The second observation is about the geodesics of Fρ.

Remark 6.4. In the two-dimensional case,
formula that the geodesics of Fρ are exactly the curves π(q−1
by γ ∈ Γρ, see [AB, Theorem 3.3].

it follows from the Crofton
ρ (γ)) given

The third observation deals with S1-actions arising from the co-geodesic

ﬂow of the Zoll Finsler two-sphere (M, F ).

Remark 6.5. In the special case when ρ is given by the co-geodesic ﬂow
of F , that is, ρ = ρF , the following properties hold. The vector ﬁeld ν agrees
with the co-geodesic vector ﬁeld XF of F on S∗
0 M ≃ S∗M . (In the sequel,
the musical isomorphisms will be omitted.) Since iXF (α) = 1, we deduce
that iν (Ω) = dα from the expression of the volume form Ω, cf. (6.1). Now,
by the Liouville theorem, the symplectic form dα is ρF -invariant, that is,
ρF (θ)∗(dα) = dα for every θ ∈ S1. This shows that ¯ω = dα. Hence, λρ = λF
by deﬁnition of λF , cf. (5.2). Now, as Γρ = ΓF and qρ = qF , it follows from
the Crofton formulas (5.3) and (6.4) that Fρ = F .

We can now proceed to the proof of the following result.

Theorem 6.6. The space of balanced Zoll Finsler metrics on the two-sphere
whose geodesic length is equal to 2π strongly deformation retracts to the
canonical round metric on the two-sphere.

Furthermore, this strong deformation retraction is induced by the curva-

ture ﬂow on the canonical round two-sphere.

Proof. Let (M, F ) be a balanced Zoll Finsler two-sphere all of whose geodesics
are of length 2π. Consider the deformation (ρτ )0≤τ ≤1 of S1-actions on S∗
0 M
deﬁned at the end of Section 4, where ρ0 is given by the co-geodesic ﬂow

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

♯ (α).

of F and ρ1 agrees with the co-geodesic ﬂow of the canonical round met-
ric g0. Since every ρτ -orbit projects to an embedding of S1 into M by the
canonical projection S∗
0 M → M , these orbits are transverse to the contact
structure given by the kernel of π∗
Deﬁne a one-parameter family of Finsler metrics Fτ = Fρτ for 0 ≤ τ ≤ 1
as in Theorem 6.2. We will also write qτ , Γτ and λτ for qρτ , Γρτ and λρτ .
From Remark 6.5, the metric deformation (Fτ ) starts at F , that is, F0 = F .
By Remark 6.4, the geodesics of Fτ are precisely the simple closed curves
represented by Γτ , namely, the curves π(q−1
τ (γ)) where γ runs over Γτ . Thus,
the geodesics of Fτ agree with the images of the geodesics of F under the
curvature ﬂow at some time depending on τ . In particular, the metrics Fτ
are balanced Zoll Finsler metrics, cf. Proposition 3.1, and the metric F1 has
the same geodesics as the canonical round metric g0.

At this point, we do not claim that F1 agrees with g0. Indeed, by con-
struction, the metric F1 is determined by its space of geodesics Γ1 = Γg0
and a smooth positive measure |λ1| on it, which, in this case, may diﬀer
from |λg0|. This leads us to extend the metric deformation (Fτ ) in a nat-
ural way as follows. For every 1 ≤ τ ≤ 2, deﬁne a Finsler metric Fτ as in
Theorem 6.2 with Γτ = Γ1, qτ = q1 and

|λτ| = (2 − λ)|λ1| + (τ − 1)|λg0|.

As previously, the geodesics of these new metrics agree with those of the
canonical round sphere, but now, F2 is equal to g0, since |λ2| = |λg0|.
We can also estimate the lengths of the geodesics of Fτ as follows. Let c0
be a geodesic of Fτ . By Theorem 3.3, every pair of distinct closed geodesics
of Fτ has exactly two intersection points. Hence, #(γ ∩ c0) = 2 for almost
every γ ∈ Γτ . Since the integral of |λτ| equals 4π, it follows from the Crofton
formula (6.4) that the length of c0 is equal to 2π.
In conclusion, the metric deformation (Fτ ) gives rise to a retraction from
the space of balanced Zoll Finsler metrics on the two-sphere with geodesic
length 2π to the canonical round metric g0 on the two-sphere.
(cid:3)

Remark 6.7. Theorem 1.1 follows from Theorem 6.6 by taking the ori-
entable double cover of the Zoll Finsler projective plane since, by construc-
tion, the strong deformation retraction on the two-sphere passes to the quo-
tient by the antipodal map.

7. Appendix

In this appendix, we show how ﬂexible Zoll Finsler metrics are. Given a
closed Zoll Finsler manifold M , we construct an inﬁnite-dimensional family
of Zoll Finsler metrics on M with the same geodesic length. The construc-
tion – proceeding by local perturbations of the initial metric – is loosely
constrained and fairly easy to implement. Furthermore, all local Zoll per-
turbations are obtained by following this construction.

The results in this section are not new, but we provide details we were un-
able to ﬁnd in the literature. Our presentation follows the approach of [I13]
and [BI] regarding boundary rigidity problems (and used in [C] to study
Finsler tori without conjugate points). It largely borrows from [C].

Let (M, F ) be a closed Finsler n-manifold. Fix an open ball D in M
of radius less than 1
4 inj(M ) centered at x0 . For every p ∈ ∂D, the ar-
clength parametrized geodesic γp with γp(0) = x0 and γp(r) = p deﬁnes a
point γp(−r) lying in ∂D denoted by −p. The set of points of D equidistant
from p and −p forms a hypersurface Hp passing through x0 which divides D
into two connected components: H +
p containing −p.

Deﬁne a smooth function f : ∂D × D → R as

f (p, x) =(d(Hp, x)
−d(Hp, x)

if x ∈ H +
p
otherwise

For every p ∈ ∂D, denote fp = f (p,·). The function f is an enveloping
function, that is, it satisﬁes the following conditions:

(1) for every x ∈ D, the map p 7→ dfp(x) is a diﬀeomorphism from ∂D
x M containing

to the boundary of a quadratically convex body of T ∗
the origin;

(2) for every p ∈ ∂D, we have f−p = −fp.

In our case, the boundary of the quadratically convex body in (1) is S∗
xM
since F ∗(dfp(x)) = 1 for every p ∈ ∂D and x ∈ D. The condition (2) ensures
that the convex bodies in (1) are symmetric with respect to the origin.

The distance function induced by F can be written as

dF (x, y) = sup
p∈∂D

fp(x) − fp(y)

(7.1)

for every x, y ∈ D. Similarly, the Finsler metric F can be expressed as

F (v) = sup
p∈∂D

dfp(v)

for every v ∈ T D.

Consider a suﬃciently small C ∞-perturbation ˜f of f such that ˜f is an
enveloping function which agrees with f on ∂D × U , where U is a tubular
neighborhood of ∂D in D. Note that if the perturbation is small enough,
the condition (1) is immediately satisﬁed by ˜f .

Deﬁne a new Finsler metric ˜F on D as

˜F (v) = sup
p∈∂D

d ˜fp(v)

for every v ∈ T D. The induced distance is given by
˜fp(x) − ˜fp(y)

d ˜F (x, y) = sup
p∈∂D

(7.2)

for every x, y ∈ D. Here, the reversibility of ˜F (and symmetry of d ˜F ) follows
from the condition (2). Also, the function ˜fp satisﬁes ˜F ∗(d ˜fp(x)) = 1 for
every x ∈ D. Moreover, for every x ∈ D, there exists a unique ˜F -unit
tangent vector v ∈ TxD such that d ˜fp(v) = 1. This tangent vector smoothly
depends on x (and p) and deﬁnes an ˜F -unit vector ﬁeld ˜∇ ˜fp on D, called
the ˜F -gradient of ˜fp. Since F and ˜F agree on U (as do f and ˜f on ∂D× U ),
we can extend ˜F by letting ˜F = F outside D.

The geodesics of ˜F can be described as follows.

RETRACTION OF THE SPACE OF ZOLL FINSLER PROJECTIVE PLANES

Proposition 7.1. The geodesics of ˜F agree with the integral curves of ˜∇ ˜fp
on D, with p ∈ ∂D. Furthermore, these curves are ˜F -minimizing on D.
Proof. Consider an integral curve γ of ˜∇ ˜fp. By construction, the curve γ
is parametrized by its ˜F -arclength and d ˜fp(γ′(t)) = 1 for every t ∈ [a, b].
Thus,

b − a =Z b

a

d ˜fp(γ′(t)) dt = ˜fp(γ(b)) − ˜fp(γ(a)) ≤ b − a

since ˜fp is ˜F -nonexpanding. This implies

d ˜F (γ(b), γ(a)) = ˜fp(γ(b)) − ˜fp(γ(a)) = b − a

Hence, the arc γ is a minimizing ˜F -geodesic on D.

Conversely, let γv be the ˜F -geodesic induced by some ˜F -unit tangent
vector v ∈ TxD based at x. From the condition (1), there exists a (unique)
p ∈ ∂D such that v agrees with ˜∇ ˜fp at x. The integral curve of ˜∇ ˜fp
passing through x is an ˜F -geodesic with the same initial condition v as the
˜F -geodesic γv. Therefore, the two ˜F -geodesics agree on D.
(cid:3)

Let ˜γ be an ˜F -geodesic arc of D. Since ˜γ is ˜F -minimizing, it leaves D

through two points x and y in ∂D.

Proposition 7.2. Let γ be the F -geodesic arc of D with the same endpoints
as ˜γ. Then, the arcs γ and ˜γ satisfy ℓ ˜F (˜γ) = ℓF (γ) and have the same
tangent vectors at their endpoints x and y.

Proof. Let us show this latter statement holds for the tangent vectors of γ
and ˜γ at y (and so at x, by symmetry). Fix a point y+ close to y lying slightly
outside ¯D on the F -geodesic extension of γ. Denote by α the F -minimizing
arc (lying on the F -geodesic extension of γ) joining y to y+, cf. Figure 2.
The arc α is also minimizing for ˜F since ˜F = F in the neighborhood of y.

Since f and ˜f agree on ∂D × U , we deduce from the expression of dF
and d ˜F , cf. (7.1) and (7.2), that dF = d ˜F not only for pairs of points in a
neighborhood of y but on ∂D × ∂D. Thus, for every z ∈ ∂D close enough
to y, we have

dF (x, z) + dF (z, y+) = d ˜F (x, z) + d ˜F (z, y+).

The inﬁmum of the left-hand side of this equation over such z is attained
for z = y. By a ﬁrst variation argument applied to the right-hand side of the
equation, we deduce that ˜γ∪ α is smooth. (Recall that ˜γ is an ˜F -minimizing

22

S. SABOURAU

arc joining x to y, and that α is an ˜F -minimizing arc joining y to y+.) Thus,
the unit tangent vectors of ˜γ at y is the same as the unit tangent vector of α
(and so γ) at y.

Now, since γ and ˜γ are minimizing with respect to F and ˜F , the rela-

tion dF = d ˜F on ∂D × ∂D also implies

ℓ ˜F (˜γ) = d ˜F (x, y) = dF (x, y) = ℓF (γ).

(cid:3)

Suppose now that F is a Zoll Finsler metric and that, in addition, the
radius of D is small enough so that the geodesics of F pass at most once
through D. We derive from Proposition 7.2 that the geodesics of ˜F are
closed and agree with those of F outside D. Furthermore, they are simple
and have the same length as those of F . In other words, ˜F is also a Zoll
Finsler metric with the same geodesic length as F .

To make sure the Finsler metrics are not pairwise isometric, we can pro-
ceed as follows. Consider the Mahler product volume of a two-dimensional
centrally symmetric convex body B in an aﬃne plane E

P(B) = vol(B × B∗)

where vol is the volume induced by the canonical symplectic form on E×E∗.
The Mahler product volume is an aﬃne invariant of B which satisﬁes the
sharp lower bound P(B) ≥ 8 in dimension two, with equality if and only if
B is a parallelogram, cf. [T96, Theorem 2.3.4].
Let B be an n-dimensional centrally symmetric convex body in an aﬃne

n-space. Deﬁne the aﬃne planar content of B as
P P(B ∩ P )

c(B) = min

x0) ≤ c(BF

x ) for every x ∈ M , where BF

where P runs over the planes passing through the center of B. The aﬃne
planar content c(B) is an aﬃne invariant of B which satisﬁes c(B) ≥ 8. Note
that this sharp lower bound is never attained by a quadratically convex body.
To produce an inﬁnite-dimensional family of non-isometric Zoll Finsler
metrics as above, we perturb the metric F in a neighborhood of a point x0
such that c(BF
x is the F -unit tan-
gent ball in TxM . Let BF
x0 ∩ P be a planar section of B with minimal
Mahler product volume. Fix p0 ∈ ∂D such that the F -gradient of fp0 at x0,
namely ∇fp0(x0), lies in P . We can perturb f : ∂D × D → R in the neigh-
borhood of (p0, x0) (and (−p0, x0) to respect the symmetry condition (2))
through a family of enveloping functions ˜fτ which agree with f in the neigh-
borhood of ∂D × ∂D and such that the content c( ˜Fτ ) := minx∈M c(B ˜Fτ
x )
of the Finsler metric ˜Fτ induced by ˜fτ decreases with τ . Since the content
of a Finsler metric is preserved by isometries, this construction provides a
family ˜Fτ of non-isometric Zoll Finsler metrics on M with the same geodesic
length.

Remark 7.3. Note that we would derive the same result by considering
other aﬃne invariants for centrally symmetric convex bodies. We decided to
work with the aﬃne planar content because its minimum is never attained

by a quadratically convex body and because it is not diﬃcult to decrease its
value through small perturbations.
